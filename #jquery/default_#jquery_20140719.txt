[06:41:11] <DansVC> someone could explain me?

[06:49:56] <Doddlin> hi all!
[06:50:10] <DansVC> hi :D
[06:50:32] <AcidRain2012> hey :)
[06:50:42] <AcidRain2012> ^weird
[06:51:35] <Doddlin> I want to use AJAX to send a chosen value of a dropdown to a php-script which is connected to WPDB to retrieve options depending on the choice made by the user and then populate another dropdown with the results. How do I use the AJAX if I have no form?
[06:52:02] <Doddlin> Currently I use ‚Äù:selected‚Äù to check for actions but can I use GET/POST in the PHP or how do I do=
[06:52:02] <Doddlin> ?
[06:52:25] <Doddlin> AFAIK GET/POST is for submitting forms only?
[06:54:01] <systemfault> No, not at all.
[06:54:21] <systemfault> GET and POST are just 2 HTTP verbs.
[06:54:45] <systemfault> Everytime you load a page from some URL in your browser, you‚Äôre doing a GET HTTP request.
[06:55:19] <Doddlin> ahaaa
[06:55:21] <systemfault> The browser itself is a HTTP client‚Ä¶ and JavaScript gives you access to another one called XMLHttpRequest.
[06:55:47] <systemfault> XMLHttpRequest + XML is what people call ‚ÄúAJAX‚Äù
[06:55:55] <Doddlin> I just set my ajax to type: ‚ÄùGET‚Äù
[06:55:56] <systemfault> But nowadays‚Ä¶ JSON is much more popular than XML
[06:56:12] <Doddlin> yeah, I try to get the response in JSON
[06:57:08] <Doddlin> now I‚Äôm trying to get rid of an ‚ÄùUndefined index"
[06:57:09] <systemfault> Doddlin: So, what is your server-side language? PHP?
[06:57:16] <Doddlin> PHP, yeah
[06:57:35] <systemfault> If you load the page you want to be loaded with ajax simply by using your browser, do you see the data?
[07:01:47] <Doddlin> systemfault, sorry, on 3G-connection...
[07:02:07] <systemfault> Ah :/
[07:02:14] <systemfault> If you load the page you want to be loaded with ajax simply by using your browser, do you see the data?
[07:03:21] <Doddlin> atm, no‚Ä¶ Getting ‚ÄùUndefined index‚Äù for my select
[07:03:32] <Doddlin> in the response, but it is calling my php-file
[07:04:23] <systemfault> Then you have a PHP problem :/
[07:04:39] <Doddlin> I do indeed ;)
[07:04:52] <Doddlin> I‚Äôll be back when my PHP is fixed :P
[07:05:01] <systemfault> Cool
[07:09:48] <Doddlin> If I want to pass a variable to my PHP-script, the variable that holds the first dropdown-value, hos would I do that?
[07:09:56] <Doddlin> data: chosenVal ?
[07:11:27] <Doddlin> systemfault, ^
[07:11:51] <systemfault> Doddlin: { key: value }
[07:12:33] <systemfault> Doddlin: key being how you want to access it in $_POST
[07:13:21] <Doddlin> systemfault, so my key would be the same as what I type in $_POST[‚ÄôXXXX‚Äô] in my PHP?
[07:13:40] <systemfault> Yes :)
[07:13:54] <Doddlin> Nice! :D
[07:14:32] <systemfault> Basically, you should use GET to do something that reads from your database‚Ä¶ and POST to do something that writes to it.
[07:15:57] <Doddlin> I see
[07:16:23] <Doddlin> I get unexpected token for the : in {gottenvalue: selectVal}
[07:16:56] <systemfault> Doddlin: Do you mind pasting what you have on a pastebin like jsfiddle.net ?
[07:17:09] <Doddlin> systemfault, of course not, hold 1 sec
[07:20:17] <Doddlin> systemfault, http://jsfiddle.net/jMn6V/
[07:21:19] <systemfault> Doddlin: In an object, you cannot use =, it‚Äôs :
[07:21:31] <Doddlin> Yeah, forgot to change that, I tried with : first
[07:21:35] <Doddlin> got same error
[07:21:39] <systemfault> { foo = bar } is invalid, you need  { foo : bar }
[07:21:51] <systemfault> Also, you cannot use .text() on form controls
[07:21:56] <systemfault> You want .val()
[07:22:16] <Doddlin> but I get the correct response if I use .text
[07:22:41] <Doddlin> or rather, the correct output if I alert it
[07:23:05] <Doddlin> but I‚Äôll give .val a shot, 1 sec
[07:24:38] <Doddlin> systemfault, OK, value seems correct aswell
[07:24:39] <Doddlin> :)
[07:25:16] <Doddlin> but I still get undefined index despite having gottenvalue both in my AJAX-call and as the [‚Äôgottenvalue‚Äô] in the url-file
[07:25:21] <systemfault> No, not as well‚Ä¶. to get the value of a form control, it‚Äôs .val() to get the text of some normal element is .text(), to get the html of some element is .html()
[07:26:00] <systemfault> Doddlin: You probably want to POST if you want post data on your PHP side.
[07:26:10] <Doddlin> OK, testing that
[07:26:20] <systemfault> GET passes data via the URL, POST via the request body.
[07:27:58] <Doddlin> systemfault, Aaah I see, still the same response in my PHP-file though, undefined index‚Ä¶ :S
[07:28:59] <systemfault> Do you know if the issue is from the PHP or from the JS?
[07:29:54] <Doddlin> to be honest, not at the moment‚Ä¶ trying some google on it
[07:35:16] <Doddlin> systemfault, it seems as the error is in my ajax
[07:35:27] <Doddlin> I get Content-Length:0 in my Header in Chrome-devtools
[07:35:36] <Doddlin> so it seems nothing is passed...
[07:35:55] <systemfault> Doddlin: Weird
[07:36:09] <Doddlin> indeed.. :(
[07:36:21] <jq-> What's the best way to push a jquery variable to an external php script?
[07:36:37] <Doddlin> jq- seems as we are on the same page here :P
[07:36:42] <Doddlin> jq- AJAX
[07:36:56] <jq-> That's what I'm using now, works fine, but there's a post limit by browsers
[07:37:01] <jq-> So I'm not able to send as much as I need to.
[07:37:24] <systemfault> jq-: That limit is probably the on webserver you sent it to.
[07:37:27] <Doddlin> jq- OK, someone else has to take that one, I‚Äôm not even able to my single call working‚Ä¶ :P
[07:37:39] <Doddlin> to get*
[07:37:40] <jq-> systemfault: Nah, I have max post set on 100m
[07:38:04] <systemfault> jq-: I‚Äôve sent multiple GB files using POST on my own webservers.
[07:38:21] <jq-> systemfault: Not files, text.
[07:38:48] <jq-> Like 5k characters++
[07:39:17] <systemfault> 5k characters is small‚Ä¶ :/ Weird.
[07:40:21] <Doddlin> I get ‚Äùundefined‚Äù when I try to get the value of my chosen select-field :(
[07:40:40] <jq-> systemfault: is sending it in a normal ?whatever=5kchars way how I should be doing it?
[07:40:53] <Doddlin> Found one of my errors!
[07:41:32] <Doddlin> how would I rewrite (‚Äô#selectfield :selected) to (variable :selected)?
[07:42:02] <Doddlin> since I have assigned my selectfield to a variable for simplicity‚Ä¶
[07:43:05] <systemfault> mySelectfield.find(':selected')
[07:43:42] <Doddlin> systemfault, will that react on a change of selects? so if i select opt1 but then want opt2, will it re-fire?
[07:44:03] <systemfault> It should.
[07:44:44] <Doddlin> :D
[07:46:18] <Doddlin> systemfault, ITS WORKING!!! :D :D
[07:46:31] <systemfault> Awesome!
[07:46:47] <Doddlin> Now I ‚Äùonly‚Äù need to make a PHP-script to get the variables and then pass it back to another drop-down.. :P
[07:50:27] <jq-> systemfault: You think it's something else that I need to add to my php.ini?
[07:51:02] <systemfault> jq-: Possibly, I'm rusty with PHP
[07:51:27] <jq-> systemfault: K. I'll poke around the php chan :P
[08:03:16] <jq-> systemfault: I figured out my problem. It's when there's punctuation in the string that causes it to stop.
[08:03:41] <systemfault> Ah, good to know
[08:03:53] <jq-> Yeah :/
[08:04:04] <jq-> So how do I get around that
[08:04:04] <jq-> Lol
[08:04:45] <systemfault> Hmm, perhaps you could try to send the form as if it contained files
[08:04:57] <systemfault> Hmm‚Ä¶ no
[08:05:27] <systemfault> I don't understand, jQuery is supposed to urlencode before sending, no?
[08:05:39] <jq-> That's what I thought
[08:05:59] <jq-> Maybe I should rewrite the whole script differently
[08:06:00] <jq-> Lol
[08:11:35] <uskerine> I would like to .show() an item with JQuery, what should I use in the html to have it initally hidden?
[09:50:34] <Miles8of9> is it possible to get a select and disguise it as an autocomplete input text?
[10:05:19] <dnash> Quick question: does this selector  $("[id$=RootAspMenu] ul.root")  select "ul" elements ending with "RooAspMenu" with a css class of "root" ?  If not, that's what I'd like to do.  Can anyone tell me what is wrong with my syntax?  Sorry for being a noob; I appreciate any help :).
[10:08:48] <systemfault> dnash: No, you want something like $('ul[id$="RootAspMenu"].root') probably
[10:09:15] <dnash> systemfault:: thanks I'll try that
[10:10:27] <dnash> that works
[10:10:47] <dnash> makes sense now that I think about it too, since the id property comes after the element type
[10:11:03] <dnash> element type then property then class
[11:11:51] <michelem> hello folks
[11:12:35] <michelem> any cleaner way to add rows and cells to a table than typing raw HTML in .append() ?
[11:14:31] <systemfault> That's the jquery way.
[11:14:39] <systemfault> jQuery loves HTML
[11:15:06] <decx> underscore
[11:15:34] <michelem> indeed, any other way?
[11:15:46] <decx> bunch of fragments
[11:16:33] <michelem> decx: not useful if you don't expand
[11:17:12] <decx> a loop with a bunch of $('<tr>') looping into a bunch of $('<td>')
[11:17:16] <systemfault> michelem: The only other way is by not using jQuery‚Ä¶. like I said before, jQuery loves HTML
[11:18:07] <AcidRain2012> why not use .append?
[11:18:25] <michelem> .append() is OK, the ugly part is the raw HTML inside
[11:19:04] <AcidRain2012> use a function? :)
[11:19:38] <AcidRain2012> thx to decx, i recently became a jquery dev leet haxor expert extreme scriptorz
[11:19:41] <AcidRain2012> ;)
[11:19:49] <systemfault> AcidRain2012: That would move the HTML inside the function.. how is it any different.
[11:19:51] <michelem> besides breaking the conceptual separation between content and logic, and making it extremely hard to find html errors, it makes internationalization incredibly harder
[11:20:01] <systemfault> The DOM works with nodes, jQuery works with HTML.
[11:20:17] <AcidRain2012> systemfault, pass the function html. that way u dont see it in your function ata ll
[11:21:07] <AcidRain2012> well i personally dont see how u would have any errors with appending a cell to a table. thats just me though
[11:21:40] <systemfault> michelem: For any complex application‚Ä¶ the separation between HTML and JS doesn't work anymore.
[11:22:14] <systemfault> michelem: This is why ReactJS works so well. In an app, the JS and the HTML have the same concern.
[11:23:01] <michelem> right. Ask a bank.
[11:23:49] <systemfault> What is that supposed to mean?
[11:24:56] <michelem> it means that *actually* complex systems survive without being rewritten every year like web application *exactly* because the separation is maintained
[11:25:18] <systemfault> michelem: The domain stays the same‚Ä¶ the view changes.
[11:25:20] <AcidRain2012> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ask+a+bank
[11:25:22] <AcidRain2012> no results
[11:25:56] <systemfault> michelem: You're mixing things‚Ä¶
[11:26:25] <systemfault> And you're just dismissing what I'm saying because you think I don't know anything about software architecture..
[11:26:31] <AcidRain2012> is my irc client the only one that displays: You're mixing things‚Ä¶ (aC|)
[11:26:47] <decx> michelem http://jsfiddle.net/Se9BU/
[11:27:14] <systemfault> AcidRain2012: Thanks my IRC client for this.. it's substituing quotes with fancier ones. Perhaps your client doesn't support utf8?
[11:27:47] <AcidRain2012> hmmm.... let me check the settings. if its not there im seriously about to switch clients
[11:27:51] <systemfault> decx: Still HTML but way more maintainable :)
[11:28:31] <decx> well i recommended underscore first ^^
[11:28:57] <AcidRain2012> systemfault, what client do u use?
[11:28:59] <michelem> decx: nice code. What's "underscore" ?
[11:29:07] <systemfault> AcidRain2012: Colloquy on osx
[11:29:40] <decx> michelem a lib with a bunch of helpers, including data->template functions
[11:29:51] <michelem> AcidRain2012: check out Adium for OS X. It supports IRC>

[12:16:16] <angel_> hii
[12:17:00] <angel_> i am a newbee to jquery and javascript is there any limit on number of jquery plugins i use on my site??
[12:21:47] <angel_> anyone there.....
[12:22:13] <decx> no
[12:22:20] <decx> to both of your questions
[12:22:50] <angel_> as in i can use as many jquery plugins i want on my site??
[12:23:20] <angel_> will it effect my site??
[12:23:32] <decx> yes to both of your questions
[12:23:45] <angel_> okhh
[12:23:57] <mdev> angel just have to test and make sure a particular plugin isn't slowing things down
[12:24:10] <angel_> okhh
[12:24:54] <angel_> so on a site i can use around 20 js or jquery plugins like one for slider one for corusel etc ??
[12:25:11] <Karpuragauram> is mooncup around
[12:25:24] <angel_> okhhh
[12:30:55] <angel_> i was told that u can use only 5 jquery or javascript on a site is it so???
[12:32:08] <Vivekananda_y510> back
[12:32:18] <decx> na that's a bunch of bs angel_
[12:33:52] <angel_> okhh cool
[12:33:59] <angel_> thanxx alot
[12:34:00] <decx> it's just that anything in $.fn will be attached to any element that is wrapped in a jq object
[12:34:07] <decx> so it can get sluggish
[12:34:12] <decx> depending on the plugins you use
[12:34:20] <decx> but there is no arbitrary number
[12:34:41] <angel_> cool i appreciate it...
[12:34:48] <angel_> it was of great help
[12:41:51] <Miles8of9> decx: is it possible to get a select and show instead an autocomplete input text? is it a bad practice isn't it? :P
[12:53:12] <decx> just use an input if you want autocomplete

[15:39:10] <motaka2> so for in doesnt work ?
[15:39:18] <Ansikt> It does.
[15:40:37] <Ansikt> But for in is generally considered bad practice.  Plus you have to filter out with hasOwnProperty, and then add logic for any nested objects and so on.
[15:42:46] <motaka2> Ansikt: I hate javascript. But overall , I used for in and I console.log(varName) and it prints me 0 to 1000
[15:43:34] <Ansikt> you're better off just using while because of the prototype issue.
[15:44:23] <Ansikt> And since you're in the jQuery channel, you might as well use jQuery.each() because you get a closure out of the deal, and the object ordering issue in old IE is fixed for you.
[15:44:32] <Ansikt> And the prototype thing.
[15:45:04] <motaka2> Ansikt: $.each is not working too
[15:46:34] <motaka2> Ansikt: is it the write way to use $.each?  http://paste.ubuntu.com/7821970/
[15:49:00] <Ansikt> motaka2, http://jsfiddle.net/2K56c/
[15:50:30] <Ansikt> Better yet, motaka2: http://jsfiddle.net/2K56c/1/
[15:52:48] <motaka2> thank you but I get this error when json data is empty: TypeError: invalid 'in' operand e
[15:54:01] <Ansikt> Edit my fiddle to show your error, then press the "update" button and send me the link.
[15:59:39] <Vivekananda_y510> hi everyone
[15:59:47] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, whenever you are around do gimme a hello
[16:32:01] <hjh> hi
[16:32:41] <Vivekananda_y510> hi hjh
[16:44:42] <normalra> Okay, this is weird: http://ix.io/dtG/
[16:44:58] <normalra> Why would it work in a console, but not in the code?
[16:46:49] <Ansikt> do you own ix.io
[16:46:52] <Ansikt> *?
[16:46:57] <normalra> Uh, no.
[16:47:43] <normalra> That's the second time someone asked me the same question. Is that some inside joke?
[16:48:30] <Ansikt> No.  A while back I remember thinking "you know what would be a really cool domain name?  ix.io"  Then I saw that it was taken and my poor little heart was crushed.
[16:48:40] <Ansikt> So I wondered if you were that bastard.
[16:49:36] <normalra> Haha, whoah, why does your heart wish for ix in particular? Any random 2 letter + .io sounds nice to me :o
[16:50:33] <Ansikt> Eh, I dunno.  Just felt right.  Anyways, do you actually have working code for that?
[16:51:11] <Ansikt> Like, a fiddle or something?
[16:51:44] <normalra> Wow.
[16:52:11] <normalra> I was just about to copy and paste it, when I managed to find out why it was happening. I should do rubber duck programming :D
[16:52:17] <normalra> $("#details-nav a.selected").removeClass("selected");
[16:52:32] <normalra> ;_;
[16:52:59] <Ansikt> What's rubber duck programming?  Never heard that term before.
[16:53:34] <normalra> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[16:55:01] <Ansikt> > similar terms
[16:55:06] <Ansikt> > thinking out loud
[16:55:07] <Ansikt> lol
[16:56:01] <normalra> Yeah, I think that would be pretty weird in a work environment.
[18:02:28] <Fraz> probably the wrong channel to moan in, but i had a powercut today corrupting a js file with 10, 000 lines or so of code.....
[18:02:32] <Fraz> any suggestions?
[18:03:01] <Fraz> and dont say "back up your files"
[18:06:08] <onr> Fraz: use VCS
[18:06:39] <Fraz> whats that?
[18:07:14] <onr> version control system
[18:07:21] <Fraz> oh lol
[18:07:29] <Fraz> that doesnt solve my current problem
[18:07:44] <Fraz> it just tells me how to avoid it again in the future
[18:07:56] <onr> yes
[18:08:48] <onr> also don't worry, since you're an inexperienced programmer, 10kloc of your code might be written in 1kloc maybe
[18:10:03] <Fraz> ahh i see
[18:10:09] <Fraz> youre the channel troll
[18:10:23] <onr> unless there is a jquery plugin that fixes corrupted files, you better ask in your operating system's channel
[18:10:44] <Fraz> what?
[18:11:06] <Fraz> oh i see
[18:11:13] <Fraz> im off topic
[18:11:17] <Fraz> pardon me
[18:11:47] <onr> i don't care being off topic
[18:12:17] <onr> it's just guys in #linux or ##windows must be more capable to solve your problem
[18:12:33] <Fraz> "unless there is a jquery plugin that fixes corrupted files"
[18:12:36] <Fraz> i think you care
[18:16:18] <Fraz> and "also don't worry, since you're an inexperienced programmer, 10kloc of your code might be written in 1kloc maybe"
[18:16:48] <Fraz> where do you get the idea that im an inexperienced programmer?
[18:17:34] <onr> no revision control == n00b
[18:17:35] <onr> don't deny
[18:19:32] <Mage> whats wrong with being new?
[18:20:13] <onr> nothing
[18:20:39] <onr> he denies he's new
[18:21:15] <Fraz> im not new, ive been coding for 10 years. this is the first time i have ever lost anything
[18:23:07] <Fraz> so i never used svn, that makes me an inexprienced programmer?
[18:24:27] <Fraz> svn is better suited for teams of programmers. not an individual
[18:24:51] <onr> who said svn?
[18:26:09] <Fraz> svn is completely different to vcs?
[18:27:30] <onr> what have you been smoking?
[18:28:10] <Fraz> they are both version control systems, yes/no?
[18:31:25] <Fraz> i lost a file, suggestions on how i should handle my programming environment is not helpful at all in this situation
[18:33:44] <onr> how's that problem related to jquery?
[18:34:42] <Fraz> lol
[18:34:49] <Fraz> circular or what?
[18:35:23] <Fraz> onr, get some integrity. cos you are lacking it somewhat
[18:35:52] <onr> i think you're imbecile, sorry
[18:35:59] <Fraz> <onr> i don't care being off topic
[18:36:03] <Fraz> then
[18:36:14] <Fraz> <onr> how's that problem related to jquery?
[18:36:56] <onr> as if i care whatever you say in the damn channel
[18:37:09] <Fraz> i see
[18:37:13] <onr> ok. do whatever you want. ask in #css for your corrupted css files
[18:39:38] <Fraz> i could, and would. and i know people would say it is the wrong place to ask as i stated when i asked the question initially. I was mereley hoping someone might have had the same problem so it makes sense to ask the question in a channel like this rather than #windows or whatever os channel.
[18:40:40] <Fraz> your stance has gone from its ok to suddenly not ok
[18:42:05] <Fraz> gone from "say what you want" to "this isnt about jquery"
[18:43:04] <Fraz> aka get some integrity
[19:28:51] <ParserError> I use a facebook module and when I called for the second time my page where the facebook module, the module does not appear
[19:43:24] <ParserError> I use a facebook module and when I called for the second time my page where the facebook module, the module does not appear
[20:06:16] <vikinghug> I'm getting a super weird error
[20:07:23] <systemfault> Welcome to the club.
[20:07:38] <vikinghug> https://gist.github.com/itsthatguy/8ce5e5c28ce2063204ce
[20:09:31] <systemfault> vikinghug: I don‚Äôt know about coffeescript but it looks fine.
[20:11:09] <vikinghug> systemfault: I just updated it with the javascript version
[20:11:31] <systemfault> mouseneter ?
[20:11:34] <vikinghug> fixed
[20:11:36] <vikinghug> was just a typo
[20:11:48] <systemfault> The code looks fine. :/
[20:11:51] <vikinghug> yea, exactly
[20:11:57] <vikinghug> and thus why i said super weird error
[20:12:19] <systemfault> vikinghug: Probably caused by something else. :/
[20:12:41] <vikinghug> systemfault: I remove that block, and everything functions normally
[20:12:45] <vikinghug> no more errors
[20:13:09] <vikinghug> https://gist.github.com/itsthatguy/7500375cbd57cb9bb1a0
[20:13:15] <systemfault> vikinghug:  I mean, it could be a ‚Äúconflict‚Äù between two blocks of code.
[20:15:56] <vikinghug> seems unlikely in this instance
[20:19:41] <vikinghug> this is literally all it takes to break it
[20:19:42] <vikinghug> $("body").on 'mouseenter', '.branches', (e) -> console.log e
[20:20:16] <vikinghug> $("body").on 'mouseenter', '.branches', (e) -> console.log e.clientY
[20:20:20] <vikinghug> that works without any errror
[20:21:24] <vikinghug> when i try to target anything else like, e.target it breaks
[20:24:08] <systemfault> vikinghug: Try using ‚Äúthis‚Äù instead of event.target
[20:24:16] <systemfault> But still. that error doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me.
[20:24:18] <vikinghug> systemfault: same deal
[20:32:54] <sdw> I'm having some trouble with an asynchonous form submission. I don't have much experience with JS/web and was hoping someone could take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/5gPFB/
[20:33:51] <Velveeta> sdw: what's the actual problem you're having?
[20:33:59] <systemfault> sdw: Your code looks fine.
[20:34:15] <sdw> it's not intercepting the form. it's performing the post per usual
[20:34:28] <Velveeta> try wrapping that code block in a document.ready
[20:34:38] <Velveeta> sounds like you're trying to bind it before the dom is actually ready
[20:34:44] <sdw> ok
[20:35:05] * Velveeta points at systemfault and flexes his own popeye-esque typing muscles.
[20:35:11] <systemfault> :D
[20:35:13] <Velveeta> :D
[20:41:00] <sdw> There is no change. Did I do it right? http://jsfiddle.net/5gPFB/1/
[20:41:54] <sdw> Just so we're clear (I'm a newb :)), the page is not supposed to navigate away, right?
[20:43:41] <systemfault> sdw: Don‚Äôt use inline handlers in your html
[20:45:06] <sdw> I'm following the example at the bottom of this page: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[20:45:18] <sdw> I don't understand what you're suggesting
[20:46:21] <systemfault> sdw: The problem is your onchange handlers in your html.
[20:47:26] <sdw> ok
[20:47:36] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/5gPFB/2/
[20:48:15] <systemfault> sdw: ^
[20:52:40] <sdw> That works
[20:54:54] <Velveeta> yes, there's a difference between the native programmatic submit() function, and the jquery submit() function, or the native submit event
[20:55:17] <Velveeta> the jquery submit function invokes the native submit event, which can be trapped by the jquery submit event listener
[20:55:54] <sdw> this.form.submit() is not calling the native submit event?
[20:55:55] <Velveeta> the native form.submit() function goes around the submit event
[20:56:15] <Velveeta> it's calling a submit function in the dom directly, which is what the native submit event would do
[20:56:40] <Velveeta> so the submit event will invoke the form's submit function, which you can do programmatically
[20:56:58] <Velveeta> the jquery submit function invokes that submit event, which in turns invokes the native submit function on the form
[20:57:12] <sdw> ok
[20:57:17] <Velveeta> if you invoke the native submit function on the form, directly, you bypass those things, and the submit event listener won't catch it
[20:57:56] <Velveeta> so what systemfault said was good advice.. for one thing, you shouldn't use inline events like that period, it's bad practice, but for another, if you're going to do it, don't call the native submit function
[20:58:22] <Velveeta> otherwise, it'll go around your submit event listener that's set to do an event.preventDefault()
[21:33:01] <rik316> <rik316> I have a bug and I'm not entirely sure why. http://pastebin.com/zP0XWwg7   Line 23
[21:33:01] <rik316> * lilmonkey has quit (Excess Flood)

[22:04:13] <EGreg> hey guys
[22:04:14] <EGreg> anyone here?
[22:09:27] <s5fs> nope
[22:09:30] <s5fs> i'm awayu
[22:10:02] <teamcoltra> Is there a reason this ends on "2" -- when I have it set for 10 seconds it ends on 0 but when I have it for 30 seconds it ends on 2 http://jsfiddle.net/Hw5jm/
[22:23:58] <FarLight> It doesn't end on 0 when set to 10 for me
[22:24:05] <FarLight> It always ends at 2 no matter what the value.
[22:24:42] <FarLight> teamcoltra: might i suggest using new Date() and getTime()?
[22:26:54] <teamcoltra> thanks FarLight I will look into that :)
[22:35:02] <FarLight> teamcoltra: Possible implementation http://jsfiddle.net/Hw5jm/11/
[22:36:07] <teamcoltra> FarLight thanks... after searching more I made a new design which also works http://jsfiddle.net/Hw5jm/7/ -- how would you compare our two solutions?
[22:36:26] <teamcoltra> lol mine looks far more bare bones than yours
[22:38:14] <FarLight> I don't know enought about how set interval works to be honest, but yeah less code is usually better.
[22:38:31] <FarLight> And mine makes new date objects each interval where yours doesn't
[22:39:32] <FarLight> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/985670/will-setinterval-drift
[22:40:33] <FarLight> That's the reason I was inclined to use an absolute frame of reference for the startTime rather than rely on incrementing a variable.
[22:40:38] <FarLight> But how accurate does your app have to be?
[22:40:50] <s5fs> i'd use setTimeout over setInterval
[22:41:04] <s5fs> reschedule the next call once the first completes
[22:41:36] <FarLight> s5fs: What about the time between when the last timeout finished to when the next timeout starts?
[22:41:57] <FarLight> Again though how accurate does your timer need to be :P
[22:41:58] <s5fs> FarLight: track the start and end time, subtract the runtime from your desired interval, schedule the next run
[22:42:29] <FarLight> Ah okay yeah, I think keeping absolute start or end times is the way to go
[22:42:53] <s5fs> setTimeout is also better than setInterval since you can't accidently schedule too many executions
[22:43:09] <s5fs> ie, if you have a function set to run every second, and it takes 10 seconds to complete, you'll be unhappy
[22:45:39] <FarLight> http://jsfiddle.net/Hw5jm/13/
[22:48:59] <teamcoltra> FarLight sorry about the slow reply I have had my Alexa top 50K site has been down the past 48 hours and I have been focused on getting it back up. :P but yeah I really like your best of both worlds solution
[22:49:25] <FarLight> What site?
[22:49:27] <teamcoltra> Accuracy really isn't that important at all... honestly I was going to leave it counting down to two
[22:49:44] <teamcoltra> :P but astheticly it's not as nice
[22:49:49] <teamcoltra> http://tuebl.ca
[22:50:14] <teamcoltra> We are a website for authors to share their books for free with their fans
[22:50:21] <FarLight> Nice.
