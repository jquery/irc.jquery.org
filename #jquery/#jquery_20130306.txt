[00:03:40] <BkaT> maybe it's time i look into JSON...
[00:09:28] <Cork> BkaT: so you get the search value server side
[00:09:46] <Cork> BkaT: so you really have to look into what the server code does, as it fails somewhere
[00:12:01] <BkaT> Cork: time to go to ##php. thanks buddy
[00:12:13] <Cork> np
[00:16:11] <arepie> i want to use async = false, when should i use it? in what event should i call it?
[00:16:20] <Cork> never EVER
[00:16:55] <Cork> synchronous ajax calls is left for legacy support in old webpages, it shouldn't ever be used in new pages
[00:18:20] <arepie> so.. how can i fix my code
[00:18:42] <arepie> i need the json to be exists before i do any calculation
[00:18:49] <Cork> make it not use return values, and instead use callbacks and deferrers
[00:19:13] <arepie> im using callbacks, but first, i need to get it first right?
[00:19:23] <arepie> how can i fetch it?
[00:19:35] <arepie> and make sure it is there before any calculation runs
[00:19:37] <Cork> the callback is called when the data is returned
[00:20:10] <Cork> $.ajax(url).done(function(data) { /* you have the data here */ }): /* but not here */
[00:21:17] <arepie> ok, so in the .done() i still get the return value?
[00:21:54] <Cork> or if you prefer $.ajax(url, { success: function(data) {} })
[00:22:22] <Cork> but yes, that is what async means, a function is called when the data arrives
[00:24:06] <arepie> i know.. but i need everything not to be load before i get the data
[00:24:29] <arepie> ok thank you.. i just need to ask that
[01:00:07] <thunderisr> Hi everybody. I'm using $.get to load some data when the page loads up. I do get the data but the ajax keeps loading (I can see it in FireBug). What is the problem?
[01:00:08] <Cork> thunderisr: your most likely seeing a bug in firebug
[01:00:08] <thunderisr> Is this a known issue?
[01:00:08] <Cork> it sometimes don't get notified about closed connections and will show the connection throbbing for ever
[01:00:13] <Cork> i've seen it for quite some time, not sure if theres an open bug about it though
[01:00:32] <thunderisr> oh, can I BOLD the connection close somehow?
[01:00:55] <Cork> not that i know
[01:01:05] <thunderisr> ok, thanks for your help
[01:01:27] <benbro2> what does the last line here do http://dpaste.com/1013832/ ?
[01:03:17] <xec> benbro2: depends on what a FormData object is, but .attr() is for reading attributes
[01:03:23] <thunderisr> Cork: FWIW I just downgraded from an alpha version to stable one and it's working ok
[01:04:11] <benbro2> xec:  wouldn't this always return undefined $('input').attr('name') ?
[01:04:25] <xec> benbro2: $("input") will select all <input> elements on the page, and .attr("name") will return the name attribute of the first one
[01:04:26] <benbro2> because I'm creating a new input which doesn't have the name attribute
[01:04:53] <benbro2> xec: ok. thanks
[01:05:00] <xec> so it depends on what the DOM looks like when it is run
[01:17:22] <Zepo> Good Day Guys, is there a way that I can use one JQuery Function on more ID's, like for every Selectfield I have, I want to use a special JQuery-Function.
[01:17:55] <xec> Zepo: what is a selectfield? a dropdown i.e. <select>?
[01:18:05] <Zepo> xec, Yeh.
[01:18:37] <xec> $("select").myFunction() ?
[01:18:52] <Zepo> xec That , sound's to easy.
[01:19:10] <xec> depends on what you mean by "special jQuery function"
[01:19:11] <Arekana> Zepo: do you want loop trough them or somthing like that you can just $("select").each(function(){});
[01:19:50] <Zepo> I am using https://code.google.com/p/ufd/ this for a few select's but I want it for ALL my selects.
[01:20:43] <Zepo> xec,  Yeh...("select") worked.... I need more training in Jquery. It's so simple and powerful.
[01:20:56] <QKO|Work> hi
[01:21:20] <QKO|Work> I seem unable to attach events to elements that haven't yet been attached to the DOM
[01:21:26] <QKO|Work> why not?
[01:21:29] <xec> Zepo: do you know css?
[01:21:56] <Zepo> xec, A bit . Not pretty much though my design talent's suck so I never try to learn it.
[01:22:21] <QKO|Work> Zepo: jquery uses css selectors
[01:22:40] <QKO|Work> if you need to do some weird selection and you got a designer at hand, you should probably ask him;)
[01:22:58] <xec> Zepo: ok, well jQuert accepts selector strings in the same format as css, so in css you'd do: "select {}" to select all <select> elements and "#myId" to select on an ID
[01:23:18] <xec> ignore the {}
[01:23:20] <Zepo> Ahh, sounds logical and so simple.
[01:23:45] <Arekana> Zepo: If you want to learn more about the selectors i would suggjest looking at "sizzle" its the "engine" behind the selectors
[01:24:38] <xec> Zepo: you can see more details at http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[01:24:49] <Zepo> What if I want to use special it on fields that have nothing in common except the id ? Like I would have a bunch of <input id ="date"> and they all need to use the same $ ("#date" ) function.
[01:26:21] <Arekana> id's should never be the same
[01:26:26] <FujuApple> u mean .class zepo
[01:27:00] <Zepo> So I shouldn't do the same ID's and put them in the same class ?
[01:27:13] <hooloovoo> Zepo: a id is unique
[01:27:21] <QKO|Work> hooloovoo: supposedly unique
[01:27:23] <FujuApple> y zepo
[01:27:31] <QKO|Work> a browser can render multiple elements with the same id
[01:27:44] <QKO|Work> but if you request an element based on id, you will get only one
[01:27:50] <djQuery> it won't like it but it will do it
[01:27:52] <xec> QKO|Work: but #id will only ever select a single element
[01:28:04] <xec> QKO|Work: and the html will be invalid
[01:28:14] <Arekana> also think that most browsers will throw some dirt about there bieng multilple of the same id's
[01:28:17] <xec> so.. don't do that :P
[01:28:31] <QKO|Work> xec: html will be invalid but still rendered, that is the thing to consider
[01:29:17] <QKO|Work> Zepo: moral of the story is, having non unique ids will glitch your page
[01:30:23] <E_mE> is this perfectly correct jQuery, or should I be using .attr() to be better conform? ::" $('<div class="alert alert-error"/>')  "
[01:30:57] <hooloovoo> E_mE: use $("<div>", { "class": "alert alert-error" });
[01:31:02] <xec> ignoring the leading ::" and the " at the end, its fine
[01:31:15] <QKO|Work> E_mE: it is correct, just not recommended
[01:31:21] <E_mE> hooloovoo: oh even more beautiful…
[01:31:28] <lampe2> hey iam looking for a plugin that can draw something like a chessboard? where i can drag in little icons and when they overlap the bottom one will be removed ?
[01:31:30] <E_mE> sec, i won't even respond with a dignified answer :P
[01:31:37] <E_mE> xec: ^^
[01:31:46] <E_mE> QKO|Work: ty
[01:32:23] <QKO|Work> most notably because in javascript you cannot read html coloring make the html string significantly harder to read:p
[01:32:33] <xec> i'd prefer the $('<div class="whatever'>') syntax tbh, unless you have a lot of attributes
[01:32:45] <xec> shorter, simpler, more readable
[01:33:07] <QKO|Work> xec: you must be colorblind :D
[01:33:30] <xec> what?
[01:33:43] <hooloovoo> E_mE: I think this means you can go with what you prefer. :P
[01:33:47] <xec> better to have three strings than one, you mean?
[01:34:12] <E_mE> hooloovoo: i think the object literal as the second parameter is the cleanest think
[01:34:30] <hooloovoo> E_mE: Ya i think so too. :)
[01:35:03] <xec> by all means, go with what you're most comfortable with :)
[01:35:19] <QKO|Work> xec: it's usually more readable to have one string do one thing
[01:35:37] <QKO|Work> in this case it was creating a div and adding two css classes
[01:36:02] <xec> well, it can be seen as one action, creating a div that has two classnames :)
[01:36:09] <QKO|Work> don't mistake this with actual html, where most of these are actual keywords
[01:36:16] <xec> but it doesnt really matter, its just a matter of taste
[01:36:26] <QKO|Work> and company policy :D
[01:39:14] <xec> i'm not really sure what you mean by that. actual keywords?
[01:39:14] <Zepo> Hmm, it works somehow. Can I combine selectors ? Like ("select & class !=xyz") ?
[01:39:25] <xec> Zepo: use a comma, like in css
[01:39:48] <xec> oh wait
[01:39:58] <xec> you want selects that don't have a certain class?
[01:40:10] <xec> "select:not(.class)"
[01:40:11] <Zepo> xec, Or certain id,name etc.
[01:40:52] <xec> Zepo: common practice is to apply a class to all the elements you *do* want
[01:41:02] <xec> Zepo: then just do $(".myClass")
[01:41:31] <Zepo> xec, Would be better I know but not in this case. There are to much Element's that I want and just a few I don't
[01:41:48] <xec> ?not @ Zepo
[01:42:21] <xec> Zepo: silly bot isnt alive :P i meant to link you to: http://api.jquery.com/not/
[01:43:16] <djQuery> dont forget that you can select all the items that you want then do .add to get the other items that you want
[01:43:31] <djQuery> intead of making a single select that is too unqieldy
[01:43:36] <djQuery> unwieldy
[01:43:52] <djQuery> `not
[01:44:04] <djQuery> both bots asleep
[01:45:01] <xec> b-ot: wake up!
[01:45:36] * xec pokes it with a stick
[01:46:54] <Zepo> Hmm, maybe I can ask it here too. I am taking a 2D php-array into JS with @json_encode($lResult) but the Array is pretty huge and loads the complete stuff into the source so it's just do it ugly as hell.
[01:47:09] <Zepo> How can I do this easier or more efficient? Or hide the array.
[01:49:26] <limpc> anyone here with experience using the jquery quicksand plugin?
[01:49:46] <xec> Zepo: it's not a bad way to do it tbh, no end user is going to read the source code. the alternative would be to fetch it with an ajax request or similar
[01:52:52] <boytoy> http://jsfiddle.net/jUWk2/ -- trying to make this lightbox close whenever I click outside it, but so far it only works the first time, any idea why?
[01:53:23] <djQuery> boytoy, your click is being unbound
[01:53:48] <djQuery> most likely the plugin you are using is completly destroying it or cloning it
[01:54:03] <djQuery> the plugin looks like a mess anyways
[01:54:05] <boytoy> aaaah
[01:54:13] <djQuery> I would find a different one.
[01:54:35] <djQuery> I was reading over it source and it doesn't seem to follow any of the normal jquery paterns
[01:54:36] <limpc> it seems to work fine in chrome
[01:55:01] <djQuery> limpc, click in the white box is not supposed to close it
[01:55:13] <boytoy> so it's the plugin's hideOnClick that is conflicting with my own hide on click thingie?
[01:55:45] <djQuery> boytoy, the plugins hidonclick is supposed to work on your white box
[01:55:55] <boytoy> hmmm good point
[01:55:59] <limpc> djQuery: yeah i noticed that.
[01:56:05] <boytoy> ill take it up with the author
[01:56:06] <djQuery> you only want it to hide on click of the overlay
[01:56:19] <boytoy> yep
[01:56:19] <Ov3rTaf> http://layout.jquery-dev.net/documentation.html < WTF :x
[01:56:48] <boytoy> thanks man
[01:56:55] <boytoy> prolly just a tiny bug
[01:57:13] <djQuery> Ov3rTaf, what about it its seems down
[01:57:18] <xec> Ov3rTaf: what is jquery-dev.com ?
[01:57:24] <boytoy> what jquery patterns is it the author is lacking btw?
[01:57:35] <djQuery> xec, .NET
[01:59:14] <djQuery> boytoy, doesn't maintain chainablility
[01:59:41] <djQuery> normaly you dont access the plugin by doing   $.().pluginname
[01:59:53] <xec> Ov3rTaf: sorry, what is jquery-dev.net ?
[01:59:54] <djQuery> boytoy, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[02:03:05] <djQuery> nice of u to finaly show up bot-t
[02:03:26] <boytoy> ooh
[02:04:48] <boytoy> yeah one of my devs had to add some of that stuff to some of this guy's other code
[02:04:52] <djQuery> boytoy, https://tutsplus.com/lesson/head-first-into-plugin-development/
[02:05:03] <boytoy> could he have his reasons for doing it the way he did though?
[02:05:12] <djQuery> dunno
[02:05:44] <djQuery> but the fatc  that there are hundreds of lightbox plugins out there I wouldn't spend much time on one that was like this
[02:05:45] <boytoy> cuz this dude
[02:06:01] <boytoy> i mean i know hes making like time machines and military grade js code so
[02:06:26] <djQuery> boytoy, what drives me away from it the most how little documentation he has provided on it
[02:06:36] <djQuery> no docs not worth my time
[02:06:54] <boytoy> hmmm
[02:07:04] <boytoy> yeah then theres that..
[02:08:01] <QKO|Work> anyone experienced with datatables?
[02:08:26] <djQuery> a couple years ago
[02:08:44] <QKO|Work> is it safe to add <tr> elements to rows you're about to render?
[02:09:32] <djQuery> QKO|Work, have you looked at the rows it renders?
[02:09:45] <djQuery> by the way its not safe to have 2 of them on the same page
[02:09:50] <djQuery> it reuses ids
[02:10:01] <QKO|Work> errr
[02:10:03] <Camber> Hey, is anyone in here familiar with Drupal? You don't have to be, but you may be in a better position to help me with my jquery issue if you are :)
[02:10:06] <QKO|Work> sorry, <td> elements
[02:10:21] <QKO|Work> so say I get a row and I want to add something generic at the start
[02:10:35] <QKO|Work> like.. and edit button!
[02:10:48] <djQuery> QKO|Work, there is an option for the row create that you can bind to
[02:10:55] <djQuery> thats where you should do it
[02:11:38] <djQuery> QKO|Work, what I did was use a ui.menu that would appear next to the row that was selected
[02:12:03] <djQuery> this way it didn't mess with the look of the table
[02:12:07] <Camber> Does this mean anything to anyone? Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined (jquery.js:27) - how can I find out what exactly is causing this?
[02:12:27] <E_mE> why is it that the map and each methods are inconsistent with each other on the callback parameter order? E.g:- $.map(…, function(val, index){}); and $.each(…, function(index, val) {});
[02:12:34] <E_mE> seems like a rather bad UX on the API
[02:12:38] <QKO|Work> djQuery: ui.menu?
[02:12:49] <djQuery> ?ui.menu
[02:12:54] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/API/1.9/Menu - jQuery Wiki - Transform a simple list with a few links into a themable menu widget. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.9/Menu
[02:13:13] <E_mE> comes across as an inconsistent on the expected interface
[02:13:16] <djQuery> http://jqueryui.com/menu/
[02:13:24] <QKO|Work> oh
[02:13:29] <E_mE> inconsistency**
[02:16:15] <MindSpark> hello, I am working with jqueryui tabs. I need to manipulate the content of the panel as soon as it is loaded, but for some reason this doesn't happen when I init with the load parameter
[02:16:23] <MindSpark> I mean the load event
[02:18:37] <limpc> $(document).ready() { } ?
[02:18:46] <limpc> er.. $(document).ready(function() { });
[02:20:04] <MindSpark> limpc: tried that, does not work :/
[02:20:16] <MindSpark> the thing is that only a portion on the page is loaded
[02:20:50] <Zepo> Grml, this damn selectfield don't want to get empty()...
[02:20:53] <MindSpark> I need to specify that when the content of this portion has been retrieved via ajax and has been successfully loaded and ready to be manipulated
[02:21:46] <limpc> $(document).ready() doesnt fire until the page is loaded. if you're doing this via ajax you need to use the ajax's success: function(data) { } function
[02:27:49] <MindSpark> limpc: I am using the builtin load function of the tabs widget
[02:28:02] <Camber> Hey, could somebody aid me in using firebug to help me with a jquery issue I'm having, please?
[02:28:21] <limpc> i dont think thats relevant here if you're using ajax
[02:29:45] <djQuery> boytoy, http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/super-simple-lightbox-with-css-and-jquery/
[02:29:59] <MindSpark> limpc: no, what I meant to say was, is that the tabs widget does the ajax request by itself, reads the tab href and loads it into the panel
[02:30:04] <E_mE> Is there a particular reason why the $.when() method isn't being called in my paste http://pastie.org/private/vqdqghklkbunp1mecunna ??
[02:30:33] <E_mE> but the .then() is triggering
[02:31:32] <Cork> E_mE: when takes a deferred, not a funciton
[02:31:36] <Cork> *function
[02:32:15] <E_mE> Cork: are sorry, my fault
[02:32:17] <E_mE> thanks
[02:32:25] <limpc> MindSpark: ah.. paste your code on jsfiddle or somewhere
[02:32:25] <Cork> yw
[02:42:21] <Zepo> Why do I always get kicked out of freenode when I am afk for a while and then write a bigger text...
[02:44:00] <rubinhozzz> i have a square: <rect class="crect1" fill="red" height="10000000" id="rect1" width="10000000" x="10000" y="10000"></rect>. According to its class name i would like when clicking, it shows an alert, but it doesnt work. the svg is created dynamically with ajax and thats why i use "live"
[02:44:01] <rubinhozzz> http://pastebin.com/FdVVLGk9
[02:44:10] <Cork> Zepo: sounds like either your connection is buggy or your client
[02:44:34] <rubinhozzz> when using the ID, it does works, what am i doing wrong. doesnt it work with svg elements?
[02:44:43] <Cork> ?.delegate @ rubinhozzz
[02:44:43] <bot-t> rubinhozzz, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:44:51] <Cork> don't use live
[02:45:22] <rubinhozzz> Cork, I used on and still didnt work
[02:45:38] <Cork> and the svg element is in an embeded document if i remember correctly
[02:45:49] <Cork> so you would have to bind to the svg document
[02:46:32] <Cork> on the other hand, i don't see why you need to use svg for a simple rect
[02:46:46] <Zepo> Hmmm That is strange. I am using https://code.google.com/p/ufd/ for my dropdown's and the JavaScript function I wrote to change a specific <select> based onother one( like grouping) works without it the ufd. The UFD do not refresh after the value are changed... Is there a command to reload a specific JQuery function or file ?
[02:47:43] <Cork> Zepo: you can execute a function if you have a reference to it
[02:47:48] <Cork> js don't really have files
[02:48:02] <rubinhozzz> Cork but if i do $("#rect1").... it works. It contains more than that rect. I have a big svg
[02:48:11] <Cork> it has resources that are loaded into the default scope (normally window)
[02:48:41] <Cork> rubinhozzz: ah, have you checked to the events actually bubble in svg?
[02:48:51] <Cork> else you can't use delegated event listeners
[02:49:03] <Cork> *checked so
[02:50:21] <rubinhozzz> Cork, yes
[02:50:44] <Cork> how?
[02:52:48] <rubinhozzz> Cork http://pastebin.com/4rrELSkL llo! this is using the ID but not the class, and it works
[02:53:33] <Cork> wait class?
[02:53:41] <Cork> you haven't said anything about class until now
[02:53:51] <Cork> is rect1 a class?
[02:56:08] <rubinhozzz> Cork rect1 is a ID and crect is a class, Oh have I? sorry but well, with id works but with class not :S
[02:56:47] <Cork> and $(document).on('click', '.crect', function() {}) doesn't work?
[02:57:18] <Cork> (you've used the id every time you've pasted anything until now)
[02:58:43] <rubinhozzz> sorry for that, my bad. ok i will test that
[03:02:25] <veg^> hello. i need functionality: tooltip show by click on selector, hide by click anywhere. is there some plugin like this?
[03:04:55] <Cork> veg^: disable the original event handlers and use the show and close methods to do it your self
[03:08:46] <rubinhozzz> Cork, not, the same. :(
[03:08:56] <Cork> not the same what?
[03:11:33] <rubinhozzz> Cork , i use $(document).on('click', '.crect1', function() {}) but it doesnt work yet
[03:11:52] <Cork> do you have the class on the rect element?
[03:14:43] <rubinhozzz> Cork, yes! it is on the rect element
[03:23:19] <Zepo> Is there a way to reload a html-element only, via ID or name etc. not reload the complete site.
[03:23:34] <discorpia> Zepo: use ajax for that
[03:23:56] <discorpia> .load() kan take an url with an id selector to only fetch that portion of the site for instance
[03:25:36] <muay-guy> Hi, how come when I try to submit this form I still get the beforeunload biding http://jsfiddle.net/4fNCh/381/
[03:26:38] <BadCodSmell> I have two elements and I only want an action to be triggered when on mouseleave exits both, is there an easy way to do this in jquery?
[03:27:12] <BadCodSmell> The problem is that they cannot easily be placed inside another menu.
[03:27:21] <BadCodSmell> another element* together
[03:28:38] <BadCodSmell> I can do this in various ways but they are not so elegant.
[03:34:07] <BadCodSmell> IT seems like the best I can do is to make use of relateTarget
[03:34:15] <farciarz84> hi, how to select all elements id_form-X-pax, where X is 1,2,3,4...
[03:34:16] <farciarz84> ?
[03:35:41] <BadCodSmell> Why not give the elements a class?
[03:35:49] <BadCodSmell> Or drop the ids to jquery?
[03:36:19] <BadCodSmell> You can use [] if it's not an attribute name
[03:36:39] <BadCodSmell> if its an attribute name which it most likely isn't, ha ha
[03:40:44] <Darsain> can I talk to a guy responsible for new api.jquery.com? because that shit is horrible. You can't introduce comfy searching in previous version (search bar auto-focus on load, results as you type, down/up arrows navigate to the relevant one & enter to enter the result page), just to take it away in the new one!
[03:40:47] <farciarz84> <input id="id_form-X-pax" type="checkbox" name="form-X-pax">, I need to select all X elements, how to make this?
[03:41:46] <Cork> farciarz84: the best solution is to add a class to those elements
[03:42:57] <Cork> alternatively you could try using input[name*=""], though thats not really dependable
[03:43:10] <Cork> (and its slow)
[03:45:12] <farciarz84> Cork: I need something fast for proof of concept:) You mean .jQuery(input[name*="id_from*"]), sorry I'm new to js.
[03:46:44] <Cork> farciarz84: no $('input[name*="-X-"]')
[03:47:25] <Cork> but that only works if -X- doesn't exist anywhere else in the name field
[03:51:04] <farciarz84> Cork: X is just a number, that can be 1, 2, 3. I need to select all of them
[03:51:11] <Cork> ah
[03:51:18] <Cork> that makes it harder
[03:51:54] <farciarz84> I'm trying to add class but it is difficult:/
[03:52:52] <Cork> farciarz84: so $('input').filter(function() { return /^form-[^-]+-pax$/.test(this.name); })
[03:53:34] <Cork> farciarz84: but ya, a class is the best way to solve this; by far
[03:58:12] <Drager> I'm trying to make a "Preview post" with jquery and I do it like this; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/ works but it's buggy if you spam the tabs. Any ideas?
[04:09:25] <E_mE> Does $(selector).on('click', function(){}); automatically bind events when I insert a new element with a matching selector. Similar to Live?
[04:09:28] <E_mE> .live()
[04:11:15] <seutje> E_mE: no, check the docs on .on()
[04:11:42] <seutje> it's more like $(context).on('click', selector, fn)
[04:11:46] <E_mE> seutje: is there a method like live() which auto binds? I know that live() was deprecated so I'm not using it
[04:11:53] <seutje> on does
[04:11:57] <seutje> just read the docs
[04:12:08] <E_mE> ok
[04:25:30] <Zepo> Hmpf... bad coded JQuery-plugin, I am not skilled enough to recode it :|
[04:29:37] <Kasimir> Zepo: Jquery aint badly written
[04:30:00] <Zepo> Kasimir, I don't  mean JQuery at all, I ment the plugin I am using.
[04:30:16] <Kasimir> what plugin you using?
[04:30:22] <Zepo> https://code.google.com/p/ufd/
[04:30:32] <Cork> its quite common with badly written plugins sadly
[04:30:44] <Zepo> Kasimir It's function is pretty nice and usefull but I has hell of bugs
[04:31:14] <Kasimir> Zepo: well the version of that is 0.6 so wouldnt expect miracles
[04:31:50] <Kasimir> Zepo: I'm sure I have seen something similar out there, let me do a quick browse
[04:32:24] <Cork> actually https://code.google.com/p/ufd/source/browse/trunk/src/jquery.ui.ufd.js doesn't look that bad
[04:32:43] <Cork> Zepo: if you find a bug file it
[04:36:00] <Zepo> Cork I reported the bug already found some other plugins too but they have the same bug. If you change the data of the <select> it won't change it's entrys and throws out errors.
[04:36:19] <Zepo> Cork Change the Data with JS/JQuery
[04:36:30] <Cork> Zepo: well there isn't really a way to detect if the select is changed
[04:36:48] <Cork> so only way would be to either do it through the plugin, or notifying the plugin when its done
[04:37:26] <Zepo> Cork Yeh, seems so and I tryed but I really have to bad skills it seems. I just don't know how to notify the plugin or reload it.
[04:38:49] <Cork> Zepo: well notify might be something like a reset function or similar
[04:39:07] <Cork> Zepo: but i wouldn't be suppriced if it had a function to add options
[04:52:38] <muay-guy> Hi, I'm trying to execute this ajax call when the user confirms he wants to leave the page but it doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/3kvAC/1106/   what am I missing here?
[04:57:03] <yuka> hi
[04:57:33] <yuka> jQuery('.mean-nav ul ul').show(); this line shows all my children in the menu . how can i modify this to make the submenu show only when hover over its parent?
[04:58:43] <Cork> jQuery('.mean-nav > ul > li > ul').show();
[04:59:25] <Cork> jQuery('.mean-nav ul ul').show(); will match all uls in uls within your selector, not just one step down
[05:00:20] <Cork> yuka: cross domain
[05:00:29] <xec> $(this).find("ul ul").show() ?
[05:00:39] <yuka> let me check the first line you pasted
[05:00:41] <Cork> it will do the same thing
[05:00:58] <Cork> you have no depth limitation
[05:01:15] <xec> depends on what yuka is really asking :)
[05:01:26] <yuka> well
[05:01:31] <Cork> true, if its not multi leveled menu it would be that
[05:01:35] <yuka> true its the same thing :)
[05:01:40] <xec> ?demo @ yuka
[05:01:41] <b-ot> yuka: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:01:41] <yuka> i just got 2 levels
[05:01:41] <bot-t> yuka, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:02:32] <yuka> http://www.meanthemes.com/plugins/meanmenu/ here is the demo
[05:02:54] <yuka> it has 2 options either showchild 1 or 0, but 0 turns it off , and show just always shows all
[05:03:06] <yuka> i want to modify it so that it shows child when i hover over its parent
[05:03:31] <yuka> oh yeh and you have to resize it to small window for it to actually kick in
[05:03:32] <yuka> :)
[05:04:21] <Cork> and what part is it that isn't working?
[05:04:33] <yuka> well basicly it has this in the code
[05:04:34] <yuka>  if(meanShowChildren) {                     	jQuery('.mean-nav ul ul').show();                     } else {                     	jQuery('.mean-nav ul ul').hide();                     }
[05:04:43] <Cork> yuka: i meant in the ui
[05:04:47] <yuka> so you get what it does?, it either shows all or hides all
[05:05:16] <Cork> i only see a menu with some alternatives and an x button to close them
[05:05:17] <yuka> i dont know how to modify that first line to make it show only on hower
[05:05:21] <muay-guy> Hi, I'm trying to execute this ajax call when the user confirms he wants to leave the page but it doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/3kvAC/1106/   what am I missing here?
[05:05:27] <yuka> Cork: click on the button
[05:05:28] <Cork> i don't see anything that looks out of place
[05:05:35] <yuka> it opens a menu
[05:05:39] <Cork> yuka: sure and you get a dropdown menu
[05:05:42] <Cork> so?
[05:05:46] <yuka> yes but he has option input set to 0
[05:05:59] <yuka> which enables this piece of code: else {                     jQuery('.mean-nav ul ul').hide();                     }
[05:06:09] <Cork> and what does that mean?
[05:06:20] <yuka> he hides all children
[05:06:24] <yuka> only shows the parents
[05:06:41] <Cork> there is only parents there
[05:06:53] <yuka> yes because he doesent have such drop down menu
[05:06:58] <Cork> at least i haven't been able to find anything else
[05:07:07] <Cork> so what does that page prove?
[05:07:26] <yuka> its to hard for me to setup this exact example
[05:08:25] <yuka> but i got for example: parent: About us  and then has 2 children lets say test 1 , test 2, and so on and so on
[05:08:28] <derik> i whant that value to pe parseFloat , where i must to put parseFloat ? tds.find('input.id_factura').val()
[05:08:45] <yuka> so it either shows me only the About us , or it shows me About us and below test1 test2
[05:08:52] <yuka> i want it to show submenus only when i hover over about us
[05:08:57] <yuka> you understand what i mean?
[05:12:20] <yuka> Cork: here is the example http://www.meanthemes.com/theme/lolly/
[05:12:30] <yuka> resize the page pls till the menu appears and then you will see
[05:12:33] <yuka> what i am talking about
[05:13:57] <yuka> Cork, xec : check those out, and under features you see it has submenus listed.. i want those to show only when i hover over Features not automaticly
[05:21:32] <Ziggy`> How can I catch an error with cross-domain requests or jsonp requests with $.ajax?
[05:35:50] <xec> yuka: are you talking about the mobile version? small window with the large vertical menu items hidden under the button?
[05:36:44] <yuka> yes
[05:37:06] <yuka> when you click the button, it shows parents, and you see when parent is Features it has opened its child
[05:37:16] <yuka> i would want those child to open and appear only if i go hover over the Features
[05:37:55] <xec> yuka: well, there is a reason it's like that. on touch devices you don't really have a 'hover' state. and a hover on a collapsible accordion like that is hard to use
[05:38:13] <xec> (even on desktops)
[05:38:25] <yuka> thats true. but how would you recommend me solving that when i got like 5 children in every parent
[05:38:34] <yuka> then the menu will be longer then height of the page
[05:38:46] <yuka> i got 6 parents and 5 children in each
[05:38:50] <yuka> makes a huuuuuuuuuge menu
[05:38:59] <xec> have the submenu items open on click?
[05:39:05] <yuka> ok yes !
[05:39:15] <yuka> how can i modify it like that?
[05:40:13] <xec> dunno, if it's a plugin maybe theres an option for it. or just make it yourself. or change the plugin :)
[05:40:49] <yuka> xec: https://github.com/weare2ndfloor/meanMenu/blob/master/jquery.meanmenu.js
[05:40:52] <yuka> @ line 152
[05:40:59] <yuka> the code starts
[05:41:14] <yuka> my question is just how to modify that to make i open on click
[05:42:15] <yuka> i am guessing this shouldb e modified --> jQuery('.mean-nav ul ul').show();, so it does this same thing but only when you click first a
[05:44:57] <muay-guy> Hi, I'm trying to execute this ajax call when the user confirms he wants to leave the page but it doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/3kvAC/1106/   what am I missing here?
[05:47:09] <juha_> yuka: $("a:first").on("click", function() { /* your show code */ });
[05:50:22] <xec> yuka: im guessing line 153 is part of initilization. what happens if you remove the if and always let the .hide() call run?
[05:51:04] <xec> yuka: actually, just comment out lines 153-157
[05:53:25] <StPiere> if i do $el.trigger('click') .. can i catch in the click callback if the click event has been caused by script or it's really clicked by the user ?
[05:54:50] <StPiere> ah, i can use extra params ...
[06:09:51] <bet0x> Hello all, i have a if == home do this: $('.menu-item').first().find('a').html('<i class="icon-white icon-home"></i>') wich replaces the home word (for a link) with a pretty image, BUT i want to do the something with the LAST item from the menu, when i do the same thing doesn't work, where is my piece of code, if anyone can help me i will be happy! :P (new to javascript and jquery).
[06:09:52] <bet0x> http://jsfiddle.net/9R8NS/
[06:10:27] <bet0x> only the part wich replaces HOME does work, the second with the word english doesn't
[06:14:13] <bet0x> :(
[06:17:50] <bet0x> anyone here?
[06:24:41] <bet0x> anyone here?
[06:28:55] <Jon471> bet0x why not just change the markup?
[06:30:30] <Jon471> bet0x: also - you set "text" one time, but then compare it against two different strings − it will never match BOTH of them
[06:30:52] <bet0x> can you explain me more please
[06:30:58] <bet0x> i changed the text to text0 and text1
[06:31:00] <milligan> Using jquery-ui and tabs. Is there no easier way than cookies to retain the active tab on i.e a form submit ?
[06:31:02] <bet0x> still not working
[06:32:18] <shoky> milligan: uhm if you submit it with ajax, the page doesnt have to reload..
[06:32:47] <bet0x> Jon471 i change it using this way: http://jsfiddle.net/9R8NS/1/ but still not changing my last element of the menu with the new values
[06:32:51] <shoky> otherwise, cookies are pretty much the easiest way to persist simple data
[06:34:11] <veQue> hi bet0x mind adding some markup? what is the result you actually want?
[06:35:11] <milligan> shoky, I would rather not submit via ajax. I need to do a lot of data validation etc so I am going to catch the submit and parse it all with php.
[06:35:14] <bet0x> well, let me explain, on this website http://siimed.mx/inicio-siimed-mexico/ i got the first link wich is HOME, at the js it search for home and replaces for an <i> with a class wich has a icon, but i want to replace the last one too.
[06:36:07] <pachet> milligan: why are ajax submission and php parsing mutually exclusive
[06:36:13] <BillCriswell> I'm listening to Devo. It's very appropriate for this channel.
[06:37:11] <veQue> oh
[06:37:17] <bet0x> BillCriswell whats that?
[06:37:36] <veQue> bet0x: you're just want where it says english to be an icon?
[06:37:57] <BillCriswell> bet0x: A new wave band from a while ago.
[06:38:07] <BillCriswell> It's where jQuery's logo came from.
[06:38:18] <bet0x> veQue yes as the first if does.
[06:38:37] <bet0x> BillCriswell lets google it! :p
[06:38:40] <BillCriswell> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Devo.JPG
[06:38:41] <veQue> ohh
[06:38:59] <veQue> let me use my brain for a moment,
[06:39:51] <bet0x> veQue first() is for the first element right? and last() must be for the last one? o.O
[06:40:17] <msoa> what means "event" in: $(selector).ajaxError(function(event,xhr,options,exc))          ?
[06:40:43] <veQue> yup
[06:40:46] <pachet> msoa: event handlers are passed an event object as their first parameter
[06:40:58] <pachet> it describes the type of event and the specific conditions under which it occurred
[06:41:09] <veQue> did you try last?
[06:41:50] <bet0x> veQue yes didn't work or maybe is because i don't know about this sorcery's lolz
[06:42:15] <seutje> msoa: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[06:42:32] <seutje> msoa: I do believe AJAX event object are slightly different though
[06:42:50] <Drager> I'm trying to make a "Preview post" with jquery and I do it like this; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/ works but it's buggy if you spam the tabs. Any ideas?
[06:43:27] <msoa> i use from Error event in $.ajax that has 3 parameter: error(xhr,status,error)
[06:43:28] <veQue> yeh try last() again and if that doesnt work we'll try a better selector
[06:43:28] <veQue> you are not allowed to change the markup?
[06:43:29] <msoa> but don't understand this: ajaxError(function(event,xhr,options,exc))
[06:43:29] <msoa> ?
[06:44:10] <milligan> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie <- is that plugin no longer in use ?
[06:45:18] <shoky> msoa:  the global ajax events have an event object similar to DOM events. you dont need to worry about it really
[06:45:20] <Drager> milligan: Jquery Cookie is in use
[06:45:36] <Drager> milligan: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[06:46:02] <veQue> bet0x: id="nav-menu-item-219"
[06:46:04] <milligan> Drager, will jquery.cookie.js suffice or do I need all the json stuff as well ?
[06:46:23] <veQue> just use that
[06:46:29] <Drager> Yeah
[06:46:53] <bet0x> veQue wherE?
[06:46:57] <msoa> Excuse me, can give me an example that have all parameters of ajaxError(function(event,xhr,options,exc)) ?
[06:47:40] <bet0x> veQue like this var text1=$('id=nav-menu-item-219').first().text().toLowerCase(); ?
[06:47:41] <shoky> $(selector).ajaxError(function(event,xhr,options,exc) { console.log(event,xhr,options,exc) })
[06:47:52] <veQue> in the jQuery your selector will be $('#nav-menu-item-219')
[06:48:26] <pachet> msoa: you should really only call it on the document
[06:48:27] <milligan> Drager, so now I have included the cookie plugin just after I load jquery. I am using code pretty much equal to the stuff at the top here, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4248587/jquery-ui-tabs-cookie-persistance-with-multiple-tabs . And still my debug tool is saying no cookies are being generated. Any idea what I am messing up ?
[06:48:31] <pachet> $(document).ajaxError(-->
[06:49:10] <veQue> bet0x: brb
[06:49:29] <seutje> bet0x: $('id=nav-menu-item-219') <- WAT?!
[06:49:35] <pachet> im not sure if there are plans to continue dispatching ajax events when the 'target' is the result of a more specific selector (in the case of .load(), etc)
[06:49:39] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/  indicates you're free to call it on any element
[06:50:30] <shoky> (i mean the code example)
[06:50:31] <msoa> Very Thanks friends, by.
[06:50:34] <bet0x> veQue WHERE do you want the BEERS! :P
[06:50:50] <ohcibi> is it valid javascript to have multiple var statements for the same varname?
[06:51:07] <shoky> yes. but.. don't
[06:51:08] <pachet> shoky: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#ajax-events-should-be-attached-to-document
[06:51:44] <shoky> pachet: ah
[06:52:10] <pachet> ohcibi: any after the first are ignored, typically
[06:52:25] <pachet> but better to not redeclare
[06:54:14] <ohcibi> pachet: yes sure, the point is, there is a grunt plugin that compiles coffeescripts but generates multiple var-statements if a js-file gets compiled from two coffeefiles that both use the same var name and with the bare option set.... if this'd cause any problems or is just not valid js, it should be avoided..
[06:54:41] <veQue> bet0x: back you figure it out?
[06:55:48] <pachet> ohcibi: any build process that produces that kind of output is likely to have more latent problems :[
[06:55:52] <shoky> i think beers indicates success
[06:55:57] <pachet> ohcibi: but nothing strictly wrong with it, no
[06:56:23] <pachet> shoky: ive reached the same conclusion
[06:56:45] <shoky> cheers
[06:56:52] * pachet raises glass
[06:57:01] * shoky smash
[06:57:16] <monteith> is the selector '[src$=endswiththis.gif]' deprecated?
[06:57:41] <shoky> check the docs?
[06:57:41] <yuka> juha_ thanks for that, it actually works :) however , when i click it opens sub menu but then the whole menu auto closes somehow , i guess i need to polish it abit
[06:57:57] <monteith> well it's in the docs, but throwing an error
[06:58:02] <monteith> something else is going on ><
[06:58:17] <shoky> what error
[06:58:42] <monteith> unrecognized expression
[06:58:46] <ignotus> hi, is there a jQuery chain command that runs a function once when all animations are completed?  Like $('foo').animate(...).animateComplete(myFunc)
[06:58:50] <seutje> monteith: tried quoteing it
[06:58:52] <seutje> ?
[06:59:11] <monteith> it's quoted.  you know what though...
[06:59:14] <pachet> monteith: it's valid
[06:59:18] <pachet> post some code
[06:59:18] <shoky> ignotus:  .promise().done(myFunc)
[06:59:39] <monteith> this stupid cms/platform/shitpile is dropping single quotes
[07:00:01] <ignotus> shoky: wow nice, thanks
[07:00:06] <seutje> monteith: $('[src="foo.gif"]') works fine for me
[07:00:08] <pachet> ignotus: or $(foo).animate(params).animate(params).queue(callback)
[07:00:34] <shoky> wouldn't that queue it for each element?
[07:00:45] <monteith> seutje:  yeah it's a problem with the staging platform...it's formatting quotes out
[07:00:46] <seutje> monteith: so does $('[src$=foo\\.gif]')
[07:00:53] <pachet> shoky: yeah thats true
[07:01:17] <ignotus> pachet: nice, thanks!
[07:02:29] <krespo> hallo why not working in .not() inner elements. eg in my very simple example http://jsfiddle.net/jsoalevel/SRdz4/1/  ?
[07:03:03] <djQuery> seutje, monteith  $('img[src$=foo\\.gif]')  would be a lot better
[07:03:25] <seutje> true, but entirely besides the point
[07:03:29] <systemfault> kreantos: You have a basic CSS issues...
[07:03:30] <systemfault> -s
[07:03:36] <pachet> krespo: it's css inheritance, not a selector issue
[07:03:45] <monteith> djQuery, seutje: thanks
[07:03:52] <pachet> if you inspect the actual #id11 element, you'll see it doesnt have the class
[07:04:00] <pachet> but it's nested inside another div that does, so..
[07:04:02] <systemfault> krespo: You know what the first C means in CSS?
[07:04:08] <systemfault> Err
[07:04:11] <pachet> 'crazy'
[07:04:19] <seutje> also known as "the only c"
[07:04:22] <shoky> cuckoo
[07:04:31] <shoky> lol.
[07:04:32] <systemfault> Cascading..
[07:04:36] <NoiseEee> seutje: and "the best C"
[07:04:45] <pi3r> hi all, it's been a long time that I dit not use jquery, what is the best way ton bind the click event ? .on("click")/live("click")/.click() ?
[07:04:53] <pachet> the c you can trust
[07:05:03] <seutje> unlike the big C
[07:05:06] <systemfault> pi3r: It's always .on but you need to learn the two syntaxes
[07:05:06] <krespo> patryk: how can achieve when I want apply selected classs for all divs except this with id ?  I find only .not()  but mayber there are some other possibilities
[07:05:21] <systemfault> krespo: Your code is fine...
[07:05:35] <systemfault> krespo: It does exactly what you want… the problem is your knowledge of CSS
[07:05:44] <pi3r> systemfault: thanks !
[07:05:50] <patryk> krespo: you're talking to me? :>
[07:06:11] <veQue> bet0x?
[07:06:14] <pachet> he wasnt getting the answer he wanted from us
[07:06:20] <djQuery> krespo, here look at this http://jsfiddle.net/SRdz4/2/
[07:06:25] <pachet> so he turned to the only person he felt he could trust
[07:06:27] <pachet> patryk
[07:06:41] <pachet> rated r
[07:07:02] <patryk> pachet: more a auto-complete fail i guess? :p
[07:07:32] <veQue> anyways bet0x in case you havent got it yet try $('#nav-menu-item-219').find('a').html('<i class="icon-white icon-home"></i>');
[07:09:09] <krespo> I thought that default color is black, but already I see it ok thanks djQuery
[07:10:03] <pachet> krespo: really, the best thing you can do is read an intro to css guide
[07:10:40] <motaka2> hello i have a fadeTo and then $.ajax , but fadeTo doesnt work when ajax js working how can I first show fade to and then run jax ?
[07:11:12] <pachet> motaka2: put your ajax call in the fadeTo callback
[07:11:47] * pachet isnt sure why the animate helper methods are used so prevalently :[
[07:11:49] <ezhilvanan> use callback method of fadeTo
[07:12:03] <systemfault> pachet: animate helper methods?
[07:12:08] <motaka2> pachet: No better way ?
[07:12:13] <systemfault> Like fadeOut/slideIn?
[07:12:24] <pachet> yeah, just the convenience wrappers
[07:12:30] <systemfault> motaka2: What's wrong with that?
[07:12:32] <pachet> extensible as a broken leg
[07:12:47] <systemfault> pachet: I think the same about $.ajax...
[07:12:54] <systemfault> pachet: $.post/$.get are so useless.
[07:12:59] <pachet> yeah
[07:13:22] <systemfault> Also.. there's no way to do error handling with .post if you don't use the promise interface
[07:13:38] <motaka2> systemfault: fade to is for locking window , I use that window locker every where - like i say divCont.Lock() , I dont know which ajaxs to call
[07:14:07] <pachet> motaka2: just pass some fn as an argument to .Lock()? yeesh
[07:15:22] <motaka2> pachet: nmabe I just want to lock the window and not do anything after that
[07:15:48] <systemfault> motaka2: Then you would call your lock function without argument..
[07:15:50] <pachet> then omit the argument
[07:15:54] <pachet> :[
[07:16:11] <pachet> you dont even have to ducktype it yourself
[07:16:11] <systemfault> Or make your .lock function return a promise
[07:16:21] <systemfault> Then you could extend it as you would like
[07:16:39] <ashitvora> Hi guys. what's the best way to find if a jQueryUI widget is attached to a DOM element or not?
[07:17:03] <ashitvora> is there any convenient way to destroy previous bind before re-binding it again.
[07:17:08] <motaka2> systemfault: pachet ok thank you
[07:17:13] <systemfault> You're welcome
[07:17:54] <pachet> ashitvora: if the widget is following the guidelines, it will be set as a data property on the given element
[07:18:04] <pachet> eg $('#foo').data('someWidget') ==> true
[07:19:06] <ashitvora> thanks :)
[07:19:22] <ezhilvanan> try with unbind
[07:19:55] <ashitvora> ezhilvanan, it should be widgetName("destroy") No?
[07:20:35] <shoky> ashitvora: yep
[07:20:37] <ashitvora> pachet, thanks. I found that solution here http://stackoverflow.com/a/1679180/300089 but it doesn't work with custom widget. may be it isn't following conventions required by widget factory
[07:21:18] <pachet> likely not
[07:22:35] <SmokeyD> hey everyone. I have a question about jquery-ui themeing: I would like to give form fieldsets, which have several .ui-widget-content elements in them, a distinct look from both the rest of the page, and the widgets withing it. Is there a default ui class I can use for this?
[07:26:39] <Drager> I'm trying to make a "Preview post" with jquery and I do it like this; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/ works but it's buggy if you spam the tabs. Any ideas?
[07:29:19] <bet0x> veQue yes is working
[07:29:35] <veQue> awesome
[07:29:58] <bet0x> veQue told ya where you want the beers? :P
[07:30:03] <bet0x> veQue thank you!
[07:30:04] <veQue> you got rid of the home icon?
[07:30:09] <bet0x> yes
[07:30:14] <bet0x> wanted the other one
[07:30:15] <bet0x> :p
[07:30:33] <veQue> yeh i figured that was a battlecry of acheivement
[07:30:34] <bet0x> people at javascript doesn't like jQuery ppl, dunno why
[07:31:10] * veQue hands everyone in room a beer
[07:31:38] <veQue> bet0x: hehe you'll learn
[07:31:52] <bet0x> ueah
[07:32:00] <bet0x> anyway, didn't sleep YET
[07:32:06] <bet0x> like 47 hs without sleep
[07:32:09] <bet0x> o.O
[07:32:17] <veQue> basically every channel could start going into chaos if they stopped being specific
[07:32:21] <bet0x> first was coz i did like a gaming season with friends
[07:32:22] <bet0x> lolz
[07:32:31] <veQue> something like that
[07:33:10] <veQue> yeh been there done that
[07:34:04] <quazimodo> anyone know of a totally kickass user interface that has all sorts of cool stuff
[07:34:13] <quazimodo> I'll be more clear: like a totally awesome gallery
[07:34:42] <quazimodo> interactive, stuff moves, layers that appear and hide can have images & html in them
[07:34:56] <quazimodo> you know
[07:35:08] <BostonMA1776> Does chrome support var = ($('img').index(foo)); I keep getting -1
[07:35:22] <quazimodo> my users make picture books and the other users should have fun looknig at em
[07:35:44] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: It doesn't make sense...
[07:35:51] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: What do you think .index does?
[07:36:02] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: Or better, what would you like to do?
[07:36:05] <BostonMA1776> systemfault: It works in ie789 and firefox
[07:36:29] <BostonMA1776> systemfault: I just want to get the index of the img
[07:36:52] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: What is an index of the image...
[07:37:21] <BostonMA1776> I want to know the index it is considering it is a child of its parent.
[07:37:36] <pachet> that selector is ripe for some specificity :[
[07:39:13] <systemfault> Heh...
[07:39:19] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: Write a testcase :(
[07:40:54] <quazimodo> http://timeline.verite.co/ <-- Like this
[07:40:57] <quazimodo> this is kickass and nice
[07:41:01] <quazimodo> anyone know of seemilar?
[07:41:10] <shoky> BostonMA1776:  it works for me on chrome ..
[07:42:04] <quazimodo> not very responsive though, perhaps a bit heavy?
[07:46:10] <krespo> in my previous example I try to simulate my problem but I put stupid css mistake, but here is my real problem with .not() on this simple example http://jsfiddle.net/jsoalevel/SRdz4/1/ . After clicking in "click here" I want toggling, but don't want fire toggle when I write in textarea
[07:47:46] <djQuery> krespo, looks like the same example as earlier
[07:49:33] <BostonMA1776> Is there an alternative to index() because I cannot right a test-case
[07:49:57] <ShamanIotasTook> i am having trouble with IE and replacing the innerText inside of an H1 tag...i tried text() and html(), neither worked.
[07:50:34] <systemfault> ShamanIotasTook: Perhaps your selector is wrong
[07:50:44] <systemfault> .html() would totally work
[07:50:56] <krespo> djQuery: why when I click in textarea fire toggle, when I use .not($('.simple_area'))  ?
[07:51:25] <djQuery> krespo, the link u supplied was still the div with bad css example
[07:51:55] <pachet> confused style sheets
[07:53:10] <krespo> djQuery: can you help me how can I solve this problem maybe not using .not , because I'm crazy from this problem.
[07:53:29] <blar1> if i have a form with a mix of text inputs and selects and i want to select all of them and combine the jquery objects for all those elements into a single collection, what's the idiomatic way of combining the two selector results?
[07:53:43] <djQuery> krespo, help yourself by supplying the new link to the one with textarea that you mentionede
[07:53:53] <pachet> blar1: $('input,select', myform)
[07:53:55] <blar1> so i'd have $form.find('input[type*="text"]) and $form.find('select')
[07:54:01] <blar1> oh hey
[07:54:08] <blar1> nice!
[07:54:22] <blar1> thanks pachet
[07:54:26] <pachet> blar1: if in the future you ever have a case where you have two sets of jquery elements that you'd like consolidated
[07:54:31] <pachet> you can do something to the effect of
[07:54:58] <pachet> var $one = $('.one'), $two = $('.two'), $join = $one.add($two)
[07:55:12] <blar1> ah ha!  hadn't looked at jquery's join
[07:55:17] <blar1> thanks again!
[07:55:31] <pachet> yw :]
[07:55:40] <krespo> djQuery: sory I don't understand , what should I do ?
[07:56:01] <pachet> krespo: he wants you to link to the updated fiddle
[07:56:15] <djQuery> krespo,  but here is my real problem with .not() on this simple example http://jsfiddle.net/jsoalevel/SRdz4/1/ . After clicking in "click here" I want toggling, but don't want fire toggle when I write in textarea
[07:56:17] <veQue> quazimodo: nice find
[07:56:35] <djQuery> click the link you sent. its not the new example u speak of
[07:57:09] <krespo> djQuery: Ah today I have very bad stupid day thx, here is new http://jsfiddle.net/jsoalevel/SRdz4/3/
[07:58:31] <veQue> krespo: interesting
[07:59:02] <veQue> cant you do something with coordinates?
[07:59:05] <djQuery> krespo, your issue is not with .not
[07:59:10] <djQuery> krespo, http://jsfiddle.net/SRdz4/4/
[07:59:45] <djQuery> krespo, your issue is with bubbling
[07:59:55] <veQue> djQuery: for the win again
[08:05:15] <djQuery> krespo, http://jsfiddle.net/SRdz4/6/
[08:06:05] <krespo> djQuery: thx, I not meet with bubling(I'm not big expert in jquery). Is it good solution with using stop propagation, or is it nicer solution , when I want to achieve same solution ?
[08:07:20] <systemfault> krespo: stopPropagation is the way to go
[08:10:32] <fonko> guys, im trying to set the value of a hidden input after an ajax call because it get set to NULL and i need it in 0
[08:11:11] <fonko> the thing is that $("#current_page").val(0); seems not to be executed even though everything else gets executed :S
[08:11:22] <systemfault> fonko: We can't help without seeing code.
[08:11:27] <fonko> ok
[08:11:31] <fonko> give me a sec
[08:12:35] <fonko> oh well the code is here
[08:12:40] <fonko> www.picafotografia.com/prueba/
[08:13:01] <fonko> i was about to upload it to pastebin but i already have it here!
[08:13:21] <djQuery> love it when peeps want me to go through all thier code to find the issue
[08:13:40] <quazimodo> veQue: you haven't seen that before?
[08:14:33] <fonko> when the submitt event is called i call the function algo() wich has inside of it the $("#current_page").val(0) that is supposed to set that hidden input again... but it doesnt!
[08:15:57] <bogap> jquery 1.9.1 on IE7.   The dom doesn't seem to update when using $('#mycode').text('AAAA') .   Any idea why?
[08:18:18] <fonko> so i dont understand why $('#current_page').val(0); wont update the hidden input when calling it through ajax
[08:18:23] <djQuery> bogap, what about when u use .html insead of text
[08:18:43] <fonko> i think that is ruining me my pagination of the JSON var
[08:19:04] <bogap> It's the same -- no change.
[08:19:13] <roger_padactor> solo, trying to fix a bug where dropppable isn't working in chrome but works in FF… no errors in the console.
[08:20:14] <veQue> quazimodo: nope
[08:20:20] <bogap> $('#mycode').text('AAAA')  and  $('#mycode').html('AAAA')   It doesn't update the screen.  The object exists  $('#mycode').length is 1
[08:20:37] <veQue> i am interested in the swiping done at the bottom
[08:20:47] <veQue> accelerations
[08:21:09] <bogap> But when I read the value back using  $('#mycode').text() it returns AAAA
[08:23:18] <quazimodo> veQue: do a little dance for me
[08:23:36] * veQue dances
[08:24:50] <pats_Toms> hi, someone can suggest something for custom scrollbar?
[08:24:54] <fonko> any ideas why this isn't working?
[08:27:21] <jeffreylevesque> raindances
[08:30:40] <pats_Toms> find antiscroll
[08:35:45] <BostonMA1776> Here is the source code. enter(id) works in Firefox IE, but in chrome it says the parameter id is NULL. If possible I would prefer to use onmouseover and onmouseout over eventlisteners. http://pastebin.com/2hqesY0P
[08:37:55] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, isn't the img tag self closing
[08:39:27] <fonko> any ideas on how to make this pagination work after an ajax call (new data is added to the JSON array) www.picafotografia.com/prueba/
[08:39:39] <grafi> ._.
[08:39:49] <grafi> thanks for the highlight :P
[08:40:21] <BostonMA1776> djQuery: I don't think so.
[08:40:51] <BostonMA1776> <img /> or <img> </img>
[08:41:03] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, this is your problem $(id)   it should be $('#' + id);
[08:41:08] <grafi> <img> </img> ?
[08:41:19] <Cork> no img is self closing
[08:41:31] <BostonMA1776> djQuery: Thank you so much.
[08:41:36] <BostonMA1776> I really appreciate this.
[08:41:38] <gnarf> BostonMA1776: img doesn't close
[08:41:43] <gnarf> <img>
[08:41:46] <gnarf> thats all you need
[08:41:49] <Cork> <img> <img/> is the same thing </img> is invalid and gives unpredictable behaviors
[08:41:54] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, not that you shouldn't be doing this completly different
[08:42:07] <fonko> show_per_page and current_page are getting set to "" after ajax call :( they are hidden inputs
[08:42:15] <gnarf> self closing tags are so XHTML, just move onto HTML5 and forget about <tag/> tags
[08:42:26] <BostonMA1776> so doing <img> </img> is wrong?
[08:42:33] <Cork> yes
[08:42:42] <BostonMA1776> oh no
[08:43:23] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, http://pastebin.com/H2CwCiEt
[08:43:31] <Cork> same with <br></br> or <hr></hr> or <meta></meta> or <link></link> and so on
[08:44:50] <[1]fonko> show_per_page and current_page are getting set to "" after ajax call :( they are hidden inputs
[08:44:54] <Salcoder> <br></br> <br /> both are valid.
[08:45:04] <sandvige> is there any jQuery tricks to lookup a plain js object like that: var obj = { path: { to: { some: "data" } } }; $.dunno(obj, "path.to.some"); -> "data" ?
[08:45:11] <systemfault> Salcoder: Nope.
[08:45:22] <systemfault> Salcoder: Only <br> and <br /> are valid
[08:45:31] <systemfault> <br></br> is invalid
[08:45:53] <Clex> sandvige: not that I know of, but you can easily code it.
[08:46:31] <sandvige> Clex: yes that's easy, but I was just wondering that to avoid having it twice in my code (and re-invent the wheel :P)
[08:46:40] <Salcoder> systemfault: I have seen many examples where the browser renders <br></br>
[08:47:00] <Cork> systemfault: actually <br/> isn't valid, but it can be error corrected to be valid </br> can't
[08:47:01] <systemfault> Salcoder: Browsers are written to parse invalid HTML
[08:47:04] <Salcoder> I mean, it is old but at the time it was fine I guess...
[08:47:23] <systemfault> Cork: <br /> is XML
[08:47:40] <Cork> systemfault: ya, but 99.99999999999999999% of the uses hare in html not xhtml
[08:47:55] <Cork> its valid in xhtml, that means mimetype application/xhtml+xml
[08:48:14] <Salcoder> So, what is the valid <br> <hr> tag for HTML5?
[08:48:15] <Cork> *users have it
[08:48:24] <snover> <br>, <hr>
[08:48:26] <Cork> salazr__: exactly
[08:48:32] <Cork> *Salcoder:
[08:48:36] <Salcoder> Which one is the correct?
[08:48:44] <Cork> both
[08:48:50] <Cork> the ones you wrote
[08:48:56] <systemfault> Cork: Yeah
[08:48:57] <deepy> systemfault: what about shorttags?
[08:49:06] <Cork> deepy: doesn't exist in html
[08:49:10] <Cork> thats xhtml
[08:49:12] <deepy> It does in 4.01
[08:49:13] <Salcoder> Why is it so many different tags then?
[08:49:28] <Salcoder> I mean, pretty much now a lot of the new code is written in HTML5
[08:49:29] <Cork> Salcoder: mostly cause ppl took xhtml and wrote it in html
[08:49:51] <Cork> Salcoder: and then depended on the browser to error correct the page
[08:49:52] <fonko> guys help me out here plz!
[08:50:01] <DukeDrake> hi
[08:50:05] <systemfault> deepy: I don't use them :P I don't even know if they're valid in HTML5
[08:50:15] <Salcoder> Browsers should have some syntax error before rendering hahaha
[08:50:43] <BostonMA1776> djQuery: When I try to use the source code you gave me, I get an error. It says that line 11 is not a function (looking that the pastebin).
[08:51:06] <systemfault> Salcoder: When using xhtml, you must be "right" or else the page doesn't display
[08:51:10] <Cork> deepy: what are you referring to by shorttag?
[08:51:18] <DukeDrake> how can I check if an element has a class set at all?
[08:51:21] <systemfault> Cork: The older SGML stuff
[08:51:24] <Salcoder> Only if you define it as Strict right?
[08:51:25] <fonko> why am i getting my hidden input set to "" after my ajax call? i set it to 0 then its set to nothing
[08:51:29] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, what version of jquery are u using
[08:51:39] <Salcoder> Plus, I think w4c has a tool to verify your code right?
[08:51:42] <Cork> systemfault: as in what?
[08:51:44] <Salcoder> w3c*
[08:52:05] <systemfault> Cork:     <p<a href="/">first part of the text</> second part
[08:52:08] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, try console.log($.fn.live);
[08:52:18] <BostonMA1776> djQuery: 1.5
[08:52:21] <Cork> systemfault: wow, never seen those
[08:52:22] <Salcoder> DukeDrake: it should be something like <element class="foo"> </element>
[08:52:39] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, thats because your verion is so old
[08:52:51] <BostonMA1776> djQuery: oh...
[08:52:56] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, look up the syntax for live
[08:53:02] * Salcoder thinks it is a very old jQuery version :)
[08:53:06] <BostonMA1776> Okay I will upgrade. Is it backwards compatible?
[08:53:13] <djQuery> BostonMA1776, even though it has been depreciated in current versions
[08:53:37] <gnarf> better yet, don't use .live().... use .on()
[08:53:46] <Salcoder> BostonMA1776: some "stuffs" yeah...
[08:53:51] <djQuery> gnarf, my example used on
[08:53:56] <gnarf> `api live
[08:53:56] <b-ot> gnarf: .live(): Attach an event handler for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[08:54:03] <systemfault> .live is dead
[08:54:05] <djQuery> gnarf, only reverting to live because of his old version
[08:54:19] <Cork> deepy: can't say anything for sure as i've never read about it, but html4 inherited a lot from sgml, but as that's not an open standard they move to having things explicitly defined in the new html standard
[08:54:25] <gnarf> live is removed in 1.9, so you should remove it from all code you write
[08:54:30] <gnarf> or help someone with
[08:54:31] <DukeDrake> Salcoder: errr ... I meant, using jquery, of course :P
[08:54:39] <gnarf> if .on() doesn't exist
[08:54:44] <gnarf> use $(document).delegate
[08:54:45] <deepy> Cork: to clarify. The only legitimate way is to write your own doctype and shorttag :-)
[08:54:45] <DukeDrake> Salcoder: but never mind, I figured it in the meantime
[08:54:49] <Cork> deepy: i know some sgml features that was rarely used was removed by that; not sure if that tag format was affected
[08:55:04] <gnarf> `api delegate
[08:55:04] <b-ot> gnarf: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:55:06] <Salcoder> DukeDrake: Awesome :)

[08:55:28] <Cork> deepy: anyway if i was to venture a guess, i would go for "no"
[08:55:28] <fonko> why am i getting my hidden input set to "" after my ajax call? i set it to 0 then its set to nothing
[08:55:37] <fonko> any ideas on how to make this pagination work after an ajax call (new data is added to the JSON array) www.picafotografia.com/prueba/
[08:55:51] <Cork> fonko: attributes are strings
[08:56:19] <Cork> fonko: so if you set it to null it will be an empty string
[08:57:29] <systemfault> People should stop using attr for anything but get/set custom attributes.
[08:57:44] <systemfault> .prop is always a better choice...
[08:58:02] <Cork> i'm actually not sure if prop would help here
[08:58:43] <gnarf> sounds like .val() is whats needed here
[08:58:48] <gnarf> but either way

[09:34:48] <veQue> just read that now
[09:34:54] <BostonMA1776> So if I want to select a id do I do this $(.ID) or $(ID)
[09:35:10] <veQue> neither

[09:35:23] <veQue> $('#ID')

[09:35:38] <BostonMA1776> I meant class. My mistake.
[09:35:55] <veQue> $('.ID')
[09:35:56] <ZeroBeholder> So, a web form I built that employs a 'mask' to pretty up a phone number doesn't work in mobile browsers. I would like to turn off that feature based on functinality.
[09:36:10] <ZeroBeholder> *functionality
[09:36:25] <BostonMA1776> veQue: Okay, I thank you.
[09:36:46] <ZeroBeholder> But, I am not sure how to test that-- because I don't know it doesn't work until I hit the buttons and input doesn't happen...
[09:37:17] <ZeroBeholder> I don't want to use user agent or the similar-- as false positive identification is possible.
[09:37:28] <systemfault> People should REALLY learn CSS before JS and jQuery :(
[09:37:53] <ZeroBeholder> Never even thought of using CSS for that.
[09:38:05] <systemfault> ZeroBeholder: That wasn't for you :(
[09:38:24] <systemfault> ZeroBeholder: For your specific issue.. you need to somehow detect the feature used..
[09:38:31] <pachet> false positives are always possible
[09:40:03] <ZeroBeholder> Right, I do want to just turn that off for browsers that cannot do it. (Per the writeups by ppk @ quirksmode.org .) How can I test for the inability to input characters?
[09:40:57] <ZeroBeholder> Usually I use if(questionableFeature) {useIt};
[09:41:13] <systemfault> ZeroBeholder: If you can access the website… you probably entered a URL...
[09:41:20] <systemfault> So you can input characters?
[09:42:04] * pachet tries hard to think what browser wouldnt allow people to input characters
[09:42:04] <ZeroBeholder> Yes, it works in all tested traditional browsers. Some mobile browsers won't let input reach the input field...
[09:42:39] <ZeroBeholder> Bad code or alternative implementation may be my problem/solution.
[09:42:50] <ZeroBeholder> I'll make a fiddle.
[09:46:37] <recurse> meh ... i hate to sound defeated but im willing to pay for a couple hours of someone who really knows their stuff with #hash, query strings, load()'ing dynamic pages (and some familiarity with php would help) ... Please PM me.

[10:04:25] <ZeroBeholder> Code I want to shut off is .mask in the javascript
[10:04:42] <cheater__> hi guys
[10:04:42] <engaged> Brodingo: ?
[10:04:48] <Brodingo> yeah one sec
[10:04:59] <cheater__> i receive several divs via ajax, that i want to fade in.. how would i do that?
[10:05:13] * cheater__ is doing jquery for the first time in years and it's loads of fun!
[10:05:23] <Brodingo> engaged http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/gp6xw/
[10:05:49] <ZeroBeholder> Cheater: .load coupled with .fadein
[10:05:52] <engaged> thanks, let me try
[10:07:31] <ZeroBeholder> cheater__: well maybe not .load, you were saying you got XML or similar via ajax
[10:08:47] <ZeroBeholder> cheater__: at the very least a pastebin would hep jsfiddles make it easier to see the javascript/jQuery on it's lonesome.
[10:10:05] <ZeroBeholder> cheater__: regardless the .fadein method is probably what you are looking for.
[10:10:10] <cheater__> ok wait
[10:11:02] <cheater__> i can't post the exact code, but basicaly i have something like $.ajax({url: url}).done(function (data) { $myelement.append(data); });
[10:11:03] <ZeroBeholder> Is there a bot that echo's the documentation location for this channel?
[10:11:42] <cheater__> if i go to the url in the browser i get the exact html that i append there with .append()
[10:11:53] <cheater__> i want this stuff (it's a couple div's) to fade in.
[10:12:13] <ZeroBeholder> cheater__: chain the method that changes the CSS to not shown but still takes up space then chain the .fadein
[10:12:32] <cheater__> hmm what method is that?
[10:12:42] <cheater__> that's like literally the only jquery i've done in 2 years lol
[10:12:46] <cheater__> head's empty :))
[10:13:00] <ZeroBeholder> cheater__: I'll see if I can find it, may need to mess with the property/class for the CSS hiding.
[10:13:07] <Drager> I'm trying to make a "Preview post" with jquery and I do it like this; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/ works but it's buggy if you spam the tabs. Any ideas?
[10:13:09] <cheater__> nice
[10:13:11] <cheater__> thank you
[10:13:19] <BostonMA1776> Finally got my problem to work. Thank you DjQuery
[10:14:17] <ZeroBeholder> cheater__: the CSS property is visibility:hidden, that will make the content there but not viewable
[10:14:55] <ZeroBeholder> You can apply that css to your content directly or you can add a class that applies the CSS to your content. I usually do the latter.
[10:16:05] <ZeroBeholder> cheater__: So the visibility:hidden goes in your css somewhere as .hidden {visibility:hidden};
[10:17:06] <ZeroBeholder> Then you chain the .addClass('hidden').fadein maybe. Try it and see.
[10:18:49] <ZeroBeholder> Bonus points for swapping the single quotes for double quotes, it's a bad PHP carry over that many people say doesn't matter. This is flamewar stuff so I hope it flies under the radar.
[10:19:21] <ZeroBeholder> I use single quotes reflexively, that is the carry over.
[10:19:49] <systemfault> I used single-quotes everywhere in JS :)
[10:20:06] <Mafiay2k> hi
[10:20:18] <Mafiay2k> is there anyway to get a min.js to normal?
[10:20:27] <sacho_> not really
[10:20:40] <systemfault> Even more with jquery because $('input[type="lol"]') is nicer than $("input[type=\"lol\"]") or $("input[type='lol']")
[10:20:53] <systemfault> Mafiay2k: Minification is destructive.
[10:21:25] <ZeroBeholder> A guy on stack exchange made an effective argument that made me favor double quotes. I use it as a general rule. I will break it for any good reason. The difference between them is marginal.
[10:21:40] <say2joe> "Mafiay2k: Minification is destructive.", huh?
[10:22:02] <Mafiay2k> mmm need to deminify :(
[10:22:04] <snover> it deletes stuff
[10:22:07] <snover> and changes other stuff
[10:22:11] <snover> aka destructive.
[10:22:20] <ZeroBeholder> Mafiay2k: Google a chunk of the code. Maybe the writer of the source code has them on a page side by side.
[10:22:37] <say2joe> oh ok. well, i guess i can see that but i think the term, "destructive" is not very "constructive"
[10:22:42] <say2joe> semantics, I suppose.
[10:23:46] <ZeroBeholder> Mafiay2k: your chunk of minified code should match the code he is hosting on his site or github or elsewhere.

[10:28:54] <cheater__> it helped me a lot that you told me the name of this method, "fadeIn"

[10:39:22] <micz123> hi all
[10:40:58] <ZeroBeholder> Maybe I change my strategy, anybody use any code that 'prettifies' a phone number in a form field that works on mobile. What I have in a single word, doesn't.
[10:41:30] <ZeroBeholder> I believe to professional word I am looking for is a 'mask'.
[10:41:52] <ZeroBeholder> *the
[10:42:20] <jedimind> any number of jquery mask plugins should od the trick ZeroBeholder
[10:42:25] <ZeroBeholder> Cripes missing question marks, misspellings-- have I been drinking without realizing it?
[10:43:11] <ZeroBeholder> I'll do the right thing and just try stuff then test. But, if anyone is using one they like I would be greatful for the pointer at it.
[10:43:36] <ZeroBeholder> *grateful --sheesh
[10:43:45] <jedimind> I've used this one in the past: http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[10:43:50] <jedimind> but not specifically for mobile
[10:43:58] <jedimind> there's nothing that it does that should not be supported on mobile
[10:44:00] <jedimind> ZeroBeholder, ^
[10:44:10] <ZeroBeholder> That is the one I am using...
[10:44:10] <boytoy> lo and behold

[10:46:00] <BeBoo_> Hello, everyone. I am new to jQuery but am picking it up pretty well. I have a function that I would like to run when a button is clicked or the form is submitted. I have an anonymous callback function for the button click. Is there a way to chain them or should I name the function and just call it that way?

[10:47:14] <ZeroBeholder> http://jsfiddle.net/F2zxP/ works in fiddle, not pretty Yeah, line 404.
[10:47:15] <micz123> hi does anyone familiar with bootstrap-ajax from eldarion?
[10:47:19] <systemfault> BeBoo_: When dealing with forms, don't bind a click to the submit button, bind to the form's submit event
[10:47:57] <systemfault> BeBoo_: You could simply use an anonymous function, right?
[10:49:11] <ZeroBeholder> BeBoo: as systemfault says $("#button").on("click",function() {$("form").submit();});
[10:49:25] <systemfault> Eww, never do that :(
[10:49:37] <ZeroBeholder> BeBoo: something like that-- wait what
[10:49:45] <snover> that is amazing
[10:49:49] <snover> definitely do that all the time
[10:50:01] <snover> don’t listen to these other guys, more than one form on a page is so lame
[10:50:20] <ZeroBeholder> #form as a place holder, I missed a hash...
[10:50:27] <systemfault> $('#myForm').on('submit', function(event) { doSomething; });
[10:50:55] <BillCriswell> you mean doSomethingAWesome.
[10:51:06] <BillCriswell> don't just do something.
[10:51:06] <systemfault> True!
[10:51:09] <ZeroBeholder> whatis in the brackets, that looks interesting.
[10:52:05] <BillCriswell> It's... something.
[10:52:06] <BeBoo_> Well, the button isn't a submit button, it's just a button.
[10:52:41] <systemfault> BeBoo_: A <button> without type="button" is a submit button
[10:53:09] <ZeroBeholder> BeBoo: is your button located within the form tags?
[10:53:30] <BeBoo_> it's an input type="button" but I can probably change that.
[10:53:34] <BeBoo_> Yes it is
[10:53:49] <ZeroBeholder> BeBoo: then use systemfaults way.
[10:54:10] <BeBoo_> Great. I will give it a shot. Thanks.
[10:54:34] <ZeroBeholder> BeBoo: you can let it default to submit by leaving out type or specify directly with type="submit"
[10:54:58] <pachet> wait you can have multiple forms on a page
[10:55:00] <pachet> shit
[10:56:00] <ZeroBeholder> Alright, everyone all at once-- let me have it. I missed a hash. Whips and chains...
[10:56:29] <BeBoo_> ZeroBeholder, systemfault: That worked. Perfect.
[10:56:31] <NoiseEee> ZeroBeholder: get off on your own time!
[10:56:43] <systemfault> :)
[10:56:50] <ZeroBeholder> It is amazing that a typo is worse cause for shaming than the inefficiency...
[10:58:02] <Zerxer> random off topic question, can anyone point me in the direction of a good channel to ask something regarding chrome extension development?
[10:58:11] <BeBoo_> I'm having fun with $.post for user registration/login. This is very easy. Not sure why I haven't learned jQuery sooner.
[10:58:24] <systemfault> BeBoo_: Welcome to the club
[10:59:23] <NoiseEee> Zerxer: try #chromium-extensions
[10:59:59] <Zerxer> thanks, just stumbled upon that myself as well :)

[11:35:24] <micz123_> systemfault its supposed to be from json format
[11:35:51] <anew> how is twitter styling thier input type file upload ?
[11:35:52] <systemfault> micz123_: If the key has a - in it, you need to use the array notation to access the value
[11:35:59] <Soopaman> trying to figure out a native object clone pattern, but can't figure out why the following code doesn't work -> srKey = "hola"; newS = (new (typeof srKey))(srKey);
[11:36:05] <micz123_> systemfault i got it from bootstrap-ajax
[11:36:06] <anew> i like how twitter has only the camera image
[11:36:09] <anew> but cant find anything on it
[11:36:15] <limpc> background image
[11:36:28] <systemfault> Soopaman: typeof returns a string...
[11:36:34] <Soopaman> i know
[11:36:49] <micz123_> systemfault array notation?
[11:36:53] <Soopaman> it would be akin to writing new String(srKey);
[11:37:07] <micz123_> sorry im new at this
[11:37:13] <Soopaman> or new Object(srKey) if srKey was an object
[11:37:16] <systemfault> Soopaman: No, it would do: new "string"(srKey)
[11:37:26] <systemfault> Which doesn't make sense.
[11:37:42] <Soopaman> hmm...
[11:37:57] <Soopaman> is there a way to do an eval without the eval?
[11:38:09] <limpc> anew: https://abs.twimg.com/a/1362436307/t1/img/twitter_web_sprite_icons.png
[11:38:12] <micz123_> systemfault this is the code --> if (data['inner-fragments']) {       for (var i in data['inner-fragments']) {         $(i).html(data['inner-fragments'][i])       }     }
[11:38:35] <Soopaman> kinda like how you can call global functions using window["globalfunctionname"](params); ?
[11:38:50] <systemfault> Soopaman: Depends, if the function is member of an object, you could do: var x = new myObject['stringhere'](srKey);
[11:39:04] <masentinel900> Good afternoon guys!!
[11:39:19] <masentinel900> I have q problem with fancybox function
[11:39:29] <systemfault> micz123_: You need a simple JS tutorial… this is more than the basics
[11:39:30] <micz123_> systemfault could u pls take a look at http://pastebin.com/D9uA4ASw
[11:39:32] <anew> limpc yeah but what is the tech behind that ?
[11:39:34] <Soopaman> systemfault: but what if the typeof will only return native js types?
[11:40:12] <masentinel900> When I going to open it by first time open perfectly, But later in the 2 and 3°.... time show me in the error log console $.fancybox i not a function
[11:40:14] <Soopaman> i've never tried to create native objects without using the literal/shorthand calls
[11:40:22] <systemfault> Soopaman: The whole idea is bad to be honest..
[11:40:30] <Soopaman> systemfault: explain please
[11:40:31] <pachet> ^
[11:40:47] <micz123_> systemfault more or less i know what it supposes to do, but im having trouble figuring out the json format for it. i tried to test on chrome console, but it didnt work
[11:40:50] <systemfault> Soopaman: Why do you need to create an object based on the type of a variable?
[11:41:04] <Soopaman> i want a generic clone pattern
[11:41:15] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/jutbS/
[11:41:31] <systemfault> Soopaman: Since your use jquery, simply use $.extend if you want a clone function
[11:41:36] <Soopaman> i guess i could make a function to switch on typeof, but i wanted to see if i could be sneakier
[11:41:40] <systemfault> s/your/you
[11:41:46] <Alecoalec> I have a UI element (seek bar) but there is text over the seek bar, if you want to seek through the song you can click anywhere the text doesn't exist, so I'm wondering how we can disable the text to bother that.
[11:42:00] <pachet> and off he sneaks
[11:42:11] <Soopaman> whoa, what happened there
[11:42:38] <Drager> I'm trying to make a "Preview post" with jquery and I do it like this; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/ works but it's buggy if you spam the tabs. Any ideas?
[11:43:07] <masentinel900> Somebody know what happens?
[11:49:47] <flapz> moin.
[11:49:52] <flapz> moin.  What's the coresponding event, for pasting (via right mouse click), into an input box?
[11:59:25] <boytoy> anybody know of a jquery curve UI?
[11:59:38] <boytoy> say for like.. levels in photoshop or whatever
[12:09:32] <dualcore> what is the best way to always be checking for something such as a variable changing
[12:09:39] <dualcore> is there some listener that is always listening
[12:10:25] <dualcore> i want to trigger something the moment a variable changes from 0 to 1
[12:18:09] <sacho> that would be setters
[12:19:35] <dualcore> sacho: setters?
[12:24:21] <jehee> lets say I have a table. When I hover a row I want it to change background color. How do I do this?
[12:27:41] <tw2113> tr:hover { background-color: #f00; }
[12:27:50] <StephenS> How to add php code inside this $(this).html('Read more...'); instead of read more.. ?
[12:28:20] <jehee> tw2113 can something similar be done with $this?
[12:28:21] <tw2113> $(this).html('<?php //do something ?>');
[12:28:40] <jehee> lets say I have a bunch of divs who are aligned vertically
[12:28:40] <sacho> dualcore, something like this http://jsfiddle.net/zTFD6/
[12:28:44] <tw2113> jehee, you could use the .hover() method
[12:28:56] <tw2113> and then inside that, .css()
[12:28:58] <sacho> you would need to replace your variable with an object whose property you set
[12:29:16] <sacho> actually, now that I'm done with that,
[12:29:19] <jehee> tw2113 tried that, the problem is all my divs are outputs from a db so they have the same class.
[12:29:28] <sacho> simply replacing your varaible with a function would achieve the same goal
[12:29:44] <jehee> I tried something like this http://pastebin.com/QFX65kfv
[12:29:46] <guide_X> with jquery dialog (ie7), when I use it, my centered layout, goes to the left, any ideas
[12:30:39] <sacho> instead of doing var = x, you could do func(x), and instead of get_value_of_var you could do func(), and if someone attempts to call the function to set the value to 0, you could raise an event, you'd need to close over a value when making the function, I guess
[12:30:56] <jehee> tw2113 see this http://pastebin.com/pRYRHewd
[12:31:06] <jehee> excuse html typo
[12:33:59] <sacho> dualcore, http://jsfiddle.net/zTFD6/3/
[12:34:01] <sacho> a second solution!
[12:35:09] <jehee> nvm got it working

[12:40:12] <a2jmrsn> hello, I'm using jquery.unleash.1.2.js on a site and most of it works well crossbrowser-wise but on the iPod/iPhone I have problems with what seems to be "OpenFirstOnload" because none of the tabs are opened onload
[12:40:33] <guide_X> anyone know how to make jquery dialog compatible with ie7?
[12:40:53] <guide_X> the dialog is pushing the webpage layout around the page
[12:41:01] <guide_X> pushing it to the far left
[12:43:28] <NoiseEee> guide_X: i'd guess its a css issue?  but i dunno
[12:43:54] <guide_X> hmm cool
[12:44:14] <guide_X> I do notice, if I change anything in the developer panel and then change it back, the layout corrects itself
[12:44:18] <guide_X> in ie7
[12:44:25] <guide_X> (all other browsers are fine of course heh)
[12:47:20] <a2jmrsn> oh, and I want to try tricking unleash() in to thinking the first tab was clicked.  I've tried $("#id").trigger('click') on the desired element but that does not trick the iPod/iPhone in to opening that tab first.  Would someone have an alternate idea?
[12:52:48] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/pf4CF/
[12:52:55] <anew> can someone help me with this how can i actually uppload the file now
[13:02:53] <shoshy> Hey, i'm trying to create an introductional flow via jquery. (drag here, drop there, click here, enter text there etc...) .. i tried searching for ways of doing it , i came to the jquery native jquery.simulate (which is used by jquery for unit-testing) , when i drag and drop, it doesn't show the drag animation. How can i achive that?
[13:04:11] <a2jmrsn> oh nevermind... apparently jquery.unleash was acquired by a friend here http://codecanyon.net/item/unleash-jquery-accordion-slider/full_screen_preview/1851823
[13:04:17] <a2jmrsn> I take it you guys wouldn't support that? hehe
[13:05:13] <dualcore> is there a way to detect why anything happens?  something like a $(document).anything  ?

[13:06:29] <ProLoser> how can i be sure the $.loadScript() has executed the script?
[13:07:13] <wachpwnski> Is there a good way to sort the display order of divs?
[13:07:34] <wachpwnski> Maybe by some div's data-attribute?
[13:08:08] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: sure, that'd work

[13:16:28] <yogurt_truck> zlomerovic: I like gist the most by far, but pastie is also good.
[13:16:48] <zlomerovic> aha
[13:16:58] <zlomerovic> any of them, except gist-maybe, support markdown syntax?
[13:17:12] <yogurt_truck> all of them do

[13:19:01] <blackxored> Hello guys, before I go to my question, my employer is looking for some good FE devs, if you know someone (or yourself) msg me privately
[13:19:20] <hlve> *_* Is there a .delay equilivant for jquery 1.3?
[13:19:21] <b-ot> How to markdown? I don't even.
[13:20:09] <blackxored> Now, to my question, I'm trying to get a link replaced in place in a content-editable div with jquery, is there a way I wouldn't have to wait for a delay to style the link, but to do it live while the user is typing and keep updating the href attribute?
[13:20:46] <rmill> onkeyup?
[13:21:29] <blackxored> rmill is fairly complicated, yes I do have my initial handler on keyup but the deal is that once I create the link what the user types afterward goes outside the anchor tag
[13:22:07] <rmill> blackxored: Got a demo up somewhere?
[13:22:28] <rmill> jsfiddle, codepen.io, etc.
[13:22:41] <rmill> I'll just debug it with my MIND
[13:22:48] <blackxored> rmill: just simple html for a plugin i'm developing, would it made sense to upload it
[13:22:49] <blackxored> jajjaja
[13:23:05] * rmill concentrates
[13:23:14] <rmill> HNNNNNNGH
[13:23:14] <hlve> This whole day
[13:23:19] * rmill dies
[13:23:20] <hlve> has been full of non-concentrations
[13:27:09] <M4d3L-Rabbit>  popup_window = window.open(url, 'hybridauth', 'location=no,menubar=no,resizable=no,scrollbars=yes,status=no,titlebar=yes,toolbar=no,channelmode=yes,fullscreen=no,width=675,height=400'); Why this open in full windows when I am on IE8?
[13:28:37] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/GzcS9/
[13:28:48] <anew> please any idea why when you click on imag_icon div it doesnt work

[13:30:00] <anew> please here !!!
[13:30:13] <anew> if i click the globe i should get the pop for the file input shouldnt i ?
[13:30:31] <blackxored> rmill: uploading
[13:31:55] <NoiseEee> anew: you should always look in console for errors.
[13:31:55] <rmill> blackxored: My best guess: http://jsfiddle.net/TdehR/1/
[13:31:59] <NoiseEee> anew: http://jsfiddle.net/GzcS9/3/
[13:32:04] <rmill> Who knows what crazy voodoo you be tryin to pull.
[13:32:36] <anew> well damn
[13:32:39] <anew> thanks noiseeee
[13:32:46] <rmill> >:}
[13:33:35] <rmill> I once uploaded a thing.
[13:33:36] <rmill> Once.
[13:33:48] <rmill> Never again.
[13:33:53] <blackxored> rmill: too simple to be truth the think is you're using an input there
[13:34:08] <blackxored> rmill: not a ce div you would have to scan for tokens
[13:34:08] <rmill> It shouldn't matter.
[13:34:15] <rmill> WAT
[13:34:27] <blackxored> rmill: wait lol
[13:34:41] <NoiseEee> a wat generator!
[13:36:10] <otherj> anyone have a preferred method/example for collapsing/expanding nested lists? preferably by appending/destroying a class
[13:37:47] <rmill> otherj: You can do most of that with simple css.
[13:38:09] <otherj> css methods typically don't work with > ie9
[13:38:35] <rmill> ok
[13:38:48] <rmill> ?api .toggle @ otherj
[13:38:49] <b-ot> otherj: No matches.
[13:38:55] <rmill> BULL
[13:39:11] <rmill> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[13:39:28] <BillCriswell> otherj: http://jsbin.com/ohigir/1/edit here's a pretty bare bone example.
[13:39:56] <BillCriswell> addClass() should just be toggleClass()
[13:39:59] <blackxored> rmill: just found out i'm using rangy and no support there :(
[13:39:59] <otherj> well, look
[13:40:14] <rmill> blackxored: rangy?
[13:40:15] <otherj> i know how to add/remove classes. just wondering if anyone had a smooth example etc.
[13:40:19] <rmill> .g rangy
[13:40:20] <b-ot> rmill: rangy - A cross-browser JavaScript range and selection library ... → http://code.google.com/p/rangy/
[13:40:27] <rmill> O I C
[13:41:05] <otherj> thanks BillCriswell
[13:41:38] <otherj> of course, your example doesn't allow one to collapse again, but that's easy to add
[13:41:43] <otherj> cheers
[13:41:58] <BillCriswell> otherj: What do you mean?
[13:42:22] <otherj> i mean if you click again it doesn't collapse
[13:42:34] <BillCriswell> otherj: I said switch addClass() with toggleClass().
[13:42:36] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ohigir/4/
[13:42:44] <BillCriswell> "oh hi girl"
[13:42:46] <otherj> my mistake sir
[13:42:54] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[13:43:06] <otherj> i missed that line ;o)
[13:44:07] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[13:44:31] <BillCriswell> otherj: I missed something important, here it goes updated: http://jsbin.com/ohigir/5/edit
[13:44:54] <masentinel900> I'm doing a post with jquery and I receive this error  ::  SyntaxError : missing ; before statement
[13:44:59] <masentinel900> What is that?
[13:45:21] <BillCriswell> Did you paste that exactly?
[13:45:58] <masentinel900> --yes
[13:46:43] <BillCriswell> I'd have to see the code probably. Nothing is coming to mind.
[13:47:50] <otherj> BillCriswell, let me just say that you have your swag set to maximum level
[13:49:08] <BillCriswell> You're welcome haha
[13:49:14] <rakl> if I have this dom structure, how can I grab each pair of .item and .detail divs? I want to wrap them in a item-wrapper class.
[13:49:15] <rakl> http://jsfiddle.net/8sKgc/
[13:49:28] <rakl> I can use the .wrap function fine, but I don't know how to grab the pairs
[13:50:47] <BillCriswell> rakl: Umm... they in a common container?
[13:50:48] <kripster> anyone done any development for bb10?
[13:51:08] <rakl> BillCriswell the pairs or you're talking about all of them?
[13:51:16] <masentinel900> Someone has Idea what is the problem     :::     SyntaxError : missing ; before statement
[13:51:33] <BillCriswell> The pairs.. like can you cound on <div class="someParent"> {your html} </div>
[13:52:16] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/6GzGz/
[13:52:21] <rakl> no that's exactly what I need to do
[13:52:26] <masentinel900> This is my post script!!
[13:52:30] <rakl> grab the pairs and put them into a parent container
[13:53:00] <BillCriswell> rakl: I mean is all the HTML you have here wrapped in ONE parent?
[13:53:09] <rakl> oh yeah it is
[13:53:09] <BillCriswell> I'll just assume it's body.
[13:53:19] <rakl> yep, there's is a list-container
[13:54:36] <^Mike> Can I use jquery to dynamically redefine a CSS rule? I need to change the styling for some elements that are dynamically loaded, so I'd prefer to avoid using .css on them directly. If I did that, then if another batch gets loaded afterwards, it'll still be styled the old way :\
[13:54:54] <^Mike> But I think if the CSS rule were changed, then it'd apply whether the elements were on the page already or not
[13:55:23] <rakl> BillCriswell here's a better paste http://pastie.org/6407208
[13:57:31] <rakl> hmm, i'd have to use the index somehow..
[13:57:41] <rakl> or .next()
[14:01:00] <mo_roodi> ^Mike: I don't understand. How do you mean "redefine" a CSS rule?
[14:01:17] <BillCriswell> rakl: Hmmm...
[14:01:43] <BillCriswell> rakl: Ah, duh.
[14:01:54] <BillCriswell> rakl: http://jsfiddle.net/8sKgc/1/
[14:02:19] <^Mike> Suppose it is ".some_class { background-color: red }" in my CSS file. I'd like to change that to green. If I use .css, that only edits the style attribute for elements already on the page - and I need to affect elements matching that selector which haven't been added yet
[14:02:30] <BillCriswell> I had some code a little bit ago that probably worked but I was using .wrap and not .wrapAll lol
[14:02:48] <rakl> BillCriswell sweeeet
[14:02:51] <rakl> thank you
[14:02:55] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[14:04:51] <BillCriswell> ^Mike: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1212500/jquery-create-css-rule-class-runtime
[14:05:10] <LekeFly> So, how can i make the viewport expand and scroll right?
[14:05:15] <mo_roodi> ^Mike: I don't think it's possible. The only way I can think to do it would be to define 2 classes: .some_class and .some_other_class, and do $('.some_class').removeClass('some_class').addClass('some_other_class') and then when the new elements get loaded make sure they have some_other_class as theur CSS class
[14:06:12] <rakl> BillCriswell now what would be the opposite? get rid of all the item-wrappers
[14:06:15] <^Mike> mo_roodi: exactly what I was trying to do -- but I'm not sure how to reliably detect when the elements I care about get added to the page
[14:06:22] <rakl> (toggling between two views )
[14:07:41] <^Mike> BillCriswell: cool, I'll give the Rule plugin a shot
[14:07:43] <BillCriswell> rakl: I'd go through each .set, put the children .after() and then remove the .set
[14:07:55] <BillCriswell> rakl: This task seems a little weird, though.
[14:08:10] <rakl> it is, but I'm not sure there's a way around it
[14:08:20] <rakl> one view needs the wrapper class, the other view can't have it
[14:08:41] <rakl> this is where heavy commenting comes in handy :p
[14:08:56] <BillCriswell> rakl: I'll keep my fingers crossed I never come across it lol.
[14:09:20] <rakl> hah, when I deploy I'll send you the production link
[14:09:22] <mo_roodi> ^Mike: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2844565/is-there-a-jquery-dom-change-listener - This gives you some information about how to detect DOM tree changes... I'm not sure how cross browser the functionality would be but there's some information about how to detect the dom changes, at which point you could work out if there's anything that needs to be done
[14:09:44] <rakl> it's for the solveforx.com website
[14:09:57] <NoiseEee> mo_roodi / ^Mike: thats not suitable really
[14:10:19] <systemfault> There's no way to portably do that… Usually people wanting to do that want to hack an awful pile of bad code.
[14:10:35] <NoiseEee> http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion is a pretty good hack fwiw,  i believe the hack of choice
[14:12:24] <systemfault> Works only in browsers supporting CSS animations though..
[14:12:47] <kripster> is anyone using bb10 development ripple simulator?
[14:14:24] <JasonDScott___> kripster: yes
[14:15:34] <mo_roodi> <NoiseEee> / ^Mike: NoiseEee you're right, I didn't realise DOMSubtreeModified had been deprecated.
[14:23:23] <StephenS> fI have element which is hidden (textarea) and while on reload /loading page first element is always showed and then hidden fastly (but still was visible)
[14:23:25] <StephenS> what shall Ido?
[14:25:00] <LekeFly> How can i make the viewport scroll to the right on click? :s
[14:26:10] <BryanRuiz> im going to have problems if i put jquery Live inside a scroll event, arent I?

[14:28:21] <BryanRuiz> ok, im going to have problems using "on" inside a scroll event?
[14:32:57] <BillCriswell> rakl: Niiice.
[14:33:18] <NoiseEee> BryanRuiz: what do you mean 'inside a scroll event'
[14:35:48] <micz123> hi all, pls take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/micz123/JUYnv/ and tell me where do i got it worng? Thx...
[14:36:43] <micz123> hello?
[14:36:53] <chinoto> moto
[14:37:24] <micz123> hi chinoto
[14:38:21] <chinoto> I should make a script that matches strings that effectively mean "hello" and make myself respond with "moto" :D
[14:38:35] <^Mike> does div normally diplay inline, or block?
[14:38:38] <chinoto> actually, only moto
[14:38:47] <chinoto> ^Mike: block
[14:38:56] <^Mike> thanks
[14:40:52] <micz123> chinoto that would be fun :D
[14:40:56] <chinoto> ^Mike: in firefox you can inspect an element and see what properties it has (you'll need to uncheck "Only user styles"), some other browsers also implement this
[14:41:13] <coldhead> micz123: first thing i've found is you're referring to data.fragments but if you console.log(data) it looks like you want data[0].fragments
[14:41:14] <chinoto> micz123: meant "only hello"
[14:41:16] <coldhead> data is weird
[14:42:11] <micz123> coldhead how do i change the json format so i can refer to data.fragments?
[14:42:39] <chinoto> so something like /^\s*hello\s*[.?!]*\s*$/
[14:43:26] <chinoto> the "\s*"s are to avoid firing off the message for people who say something more than "hello"
[14:44:07] <coldhead> micz123: more like this http://jsfiddle.net/JUYnv/15/
[14:44:18] <coldhead> that still doesn't work because you're accessing something undefined later
[14:44:21] <micz123> coldhead got this code from https://github.com/eldarion/bootstrap-ajax/blob/master/js/bootstrap-ajax.js and im trying to figure out the json format for this
[14:44:23] <coldhead> but that looks more sensible to me
[14:44:37] <coldhead> ?fweep
[14:45:03] <chinoto> woops
[14:45:21] <coldhead> welcome back chinoto
[14:46:13] <chinoto> meant to hide the window in the notification tray, not close it >.<
[14:47:48] <micz123> coldhead got this code from the link https://github.com/eldarion/bootstrap-ajax/blob/master/js/bootstrap-ajax.js so I suppose the code works, just need to figure out how to setup the json data
[14:48:43] <coldhead> yes, fascinating
[14:48:47] <coldhead> this seems to work now http://jsfiddle.net/JUYnv/17/
[14:49:01] <coldhead> you're not inserting those inner-fragments anywhere that i can see
[14:49:07] <coldhead> so there is no visible output
[14:49:10] <coldhead> but i can see the data change
[14:49:53] <micz123> coldhead the data.fragments still doesnt change?
[14:50:46] <micz123> coldhead if the data.fragments works, it should change the div to 'Done me...' and 'Done you...'
[14:51:16] <coldhead> your code doesn't seem to be messing with those
[14:51:59] <coldhead> line 42, you create a new html element with $(i)
[14:52:03] <coldhead> and then you do nothing with it
[14:52:44] <micz123> coldhead anyway what did u change the last time? aside from the console.log
[14:53:03] <coldhead> actually it doesn't even do that
[14:53:16] <coldhead> it does $(0) and $(1)
[14:53:20] <coldhead> which are the array indexes
[14:53:23] <coldhead> and which does nothing
[14:53:30] <coldhead> i changed the format of `data`
[14:53:35] <coldhead> to match the way you are accessing data
[14:54:12] <micz123> coldhead so does my var data wrong or the code is wrong?
[14:54:35] <micz123> coldhead ah ok thx
[14:55:48] <mg983> Can someone take a look at this plugin code and tell me why it doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/mdf4DJxD I detailed the expectation in the pastebin.
[14:58:32] <micz123> coldhead actually my world turned upside down trying to match the data to the code
[15:01:06] <Eviltwin> mg983: Replace the $.fn. with $.
[15:01:40] <mg983> ach-ah
[15:01:54] <otherj> can anyone help me with this? http://jsbin.com/ohigir/6/edit the second bit of js what i'm trying to make work. basically, if a child <li> contains a link that's the current url path, i need to apply 'active' to the grandparent (? one, two, etc.) li
[15:05:22] <coldhead> micz123: no, i didn't realise i was supposed to be doing more work for you at this point
[15:05:25] <Eviltwin> otherj: Fixed, I thik
[15:05:26] <coldhead> i thought we'd finished
[15:05:39] <Eviltwin> otherj: http://jsbin.com/ohigir/7/edit
[15:05:43] <coldhead> i'm having really bad cramps from my period so i am taking a break
[15:06:02] <Almindor> hey
[15:06:15] <micz123> coldhead sorry, can u give me hint on how to adapt the data format to match the code?
[15:06:26] <coldhead> i already did, micz123
[15:06:26] <otherj> thanks! let me trying running it where the url actually changes
[15:06:31] <micz123> im clueless
[15:06:33] <coldhead> i changed it by removing a pair of []
[15:06:38] <otherj> hm. doesn't work :/
[15:06:55] <Almindor> I'm using jquery with editable datatables and using server-side data/editing and everything works, I can add and delete rows, except if I add a row (using the add/form) it does add it on server-side and in the DB, but it doesn't show it in the table itself (only if I refresh manually)
[15:07:55] <Almindor> there are no js errors or anything indicating why that is, it seems to me almost that it requests the data before the add is finished in the db or something (shouldn't be since I send add reply only when it's stored)
[15:08:15] <micz123> coldhead ah icic thx, i'll try to study it :D
[15:08:47] <Almindor> hmm actually it seems it's not requesting data after an add
[15:09:42] <coldhead> good luck micz123
[15:09:48] <Eviltwin> otherj: Well you have $('li') not $('a')
[15:09:49] <Eviltwin> otherj: http://jsfiddle.net/UWXqW/2/
[15:09:51] <coldhead> i still don't know why you're messing with this code anyway
[15:10:02] <coldhead> i'm probably happier not knowing
[15:12:48] <otherj> oh snap
[15:13:23] <gaf> hello, is there a repo of cool examples of jquery used to make animations?
[15:13:45] <Eviltwin> gaf: No
[15:16:56] <micz123> coldhead its ajax utility for twitter bootstrap :D u can take a look at the link i gave u (if u want) https://github.com/eldarion/bootstrap-ajax
[15:17:58] <coldhead> yes i can see that micz123 but i don't know why you need to mess with it
[15:19:12] <micz123> coldhead im not messing with it :D I just don't know how to set-up the data json for it... Im trying to set the response from php
[15:19:56] <micz123> coldhead so I was trying to check whether my understanding of the json structure for the response is right
[15:20:02] <coldhead> i see
[15:20:10] <coldhead> isn't it documented somewhere?
[15:20:50] <micz123> coldhead sadly rite now it isnt :(
[15:21:06] <gaf> Eviltwin, why not?
[15:22:11] <dblosevn> gaf: because you havent made one yet :-P
[15:22:26] <gaf> duh
[15:23:21] <anew> bah i cant find a decent file preview for image uploading
[15:23:25] <anew> anyone know one ?
[15:23:35] <micz123> coldhead this is the only explanation for the data.fragments --> If you have a fragments hash defined, it should contain a list of key/value pairs where the keys are the selectors to content that will be replaced, and the values are the server-side rendered HTML content that will replace the elements that match the selection.
[15:24:35] <dblosevn> ?g jquery decent file preview for image uploading @ anew
[15:24:36] <micz123> coldhead actually i dont know what is fragments hash means...
[15:24:36] <b-ot> anew: PHP & jQuery image upload and crop | WebMotionUK → http://www.webmotionuk.co.uk/php-jquery-image-upload-and-crop/
[15:25:01] <dblosevn> if only he typed that in google instead of the channel lol
[15:26:00] <zz_Inoperable> hello everyone
[15:27:11] <anew> meh
[15:27:14] <otherj> oh shit, guys, i'm close. http://jsbin.com/ohigir/8/edit   … how can i change it to add that class to the li that's 'one', 'two', etc? i guess that's great-great-great-grandparent?
[15:27:17] <dblosevn> lol
[15:27:26] <anew> dblosevn not really what i want
[15:27:36] <anew> tried google for a while, everything is with ajax, or their own custom buttons
[15:27:38] <dblosevn> just diable the crop functionality
[15:27:44] <zz_Inoperable> howdy
[15:27:47] <dblosevn> *disable
[15:27:48] <M4d3L-Rabbit> when I use $( ".deleteAction" ).click(function() {  $( "#dialog-confirm" ).dialog( "open" ); }  how do I pass THIS to the dialog?
[15:28:11] <otherj> like the one that's got the class nav-header here: http://jsbin.com/ohigir/6/edit
[15:29:13] <coldhead> micz123: http://jsfiddle.net/JUYnv/18/
[15:29:22] <coldhead> that's with changes to the code AND the data
[15:29:27] <coldhead> which probably isn't what you want
[15:29:32] <coldhead> this is not an interesting problem
[15:29:43] <coldhead> you should just bug the peopel on github to document the structrure
[15:29:49] <coldhead> rather than try to reverse engineer or
[15:29:58] <coldhead> OR MAKE ME REVERSE ENGINEER
[15:30:02] <coldhead> WHEN I AM IN HORRIBLE PAIN
[15:32:50] <Inoperable> uhm
[15:33:33] <Inoperable> how do i check if mouse is over an element after the .animate() method finishes?
[15:33:37] <Inoperable> any ideas?
[15:33:45] <micz123> coldhead thx a lot, i alrdy bugged the ppl on github, appreciated what u did here. Many thx again :)
[15:34:06] <Eviltwin> otherj: Dude, I linked you working code for this
[15:34:58] <Eviltwin> Inoperable: Arithmetic
[15:35:16] <otherj> fair enough. just thought i'd try to use class names :P
[15:35:23] <otherj> sort of an "ah ha!" moment
[15:35:25] <Inoperable> Eviltwin need to calculate the mouse position? no simpler way to check it?
[15:35:27] <otherj> thanks again Eviltwin
[15:35:37] <Inoperable> Eviltwin i got a callback function on the end of .animate
[15:35:51] <Eviltwin> otherj: You can try to use classnames but don't go from .parents().andSelf() back to .parent() and say you're close
[15:36:35] <Inoperable> Eviltwin i disable the event handlers during animate(), and when the mouse leaves the element in that time i need to fire an 'mouseleave' event
[15:36:38] <otherj> fair enough Eviltwin
[15:36:44] <dcherman> Inoperable: what's your  target browser(s)?
[15:36:55] <Inoperable> dcherman a real one
[15:37:14] <Inoperable> dcherman let say IE does not exist in my stack
[15:37:49] <sunbeam> how can i best translate the datatables jquery plugin to a different language than english?
[15:38:06] <dcherman> Inoperable: alright - doesn't look like jQuery supports the :hover pseudo, but if you use matchesSelector on the element directly, it seems to work
[15:38:25] <dcherman> least in chrome.  did not test FF, IE9+
[15:38:47] <Inoperable> dcherman thx for the tip, thought there is some kind of easier way to check out if the mouse still over an element
[15:39:19] <coldhead> sunbeam: with this kind of thing maybe? http://alexsexton.com/blog/2012/10/introducing-the-jed-toolkit/
[15:41:03] <sunbeam> coldhead: looks goood
[15:42:42] <coldhead> sunbeam: i HATE internationalisation but i heard slex's talk about that lib and was like "man this is so easy i could almost bother"
[15:42:52] <coldhead> but i still feel everyone should just learn english
[15:42:53] <coldhead> i had to
[15:43:00] <coldhead> why shouldn't everyone
[15:43:07] <SlexAxton> +1
[15:43:11] <dblosevn> +100
[15:43:34] <coldhead> exactly
[15:44:38] <dblosevn> no habla Ingls lol
[15:45:34] <Inoperable> mouse enter/ mouse leave combo event handlers with .animate()
[15:45:34] <Inoperable> i disable the listeners during .animate() and reenable them again through the callback in animate()
[15:45:36] <Inoperable> but once i leave the element and animation stills tweens
[15:45:36] <Inoperable> it leaves me with an unclosed elements since the listener was disabled in that time
[15:45:38] <Inoperable> i got callbacks for that, right?
[15:45:38] <Inoperable> so the idea was to fire a callback and check if the mice still over the lement
[15:45:39] <otherj> Eviltwin, you're manly and/or womanly
[15:45:40] <Inoperable> if it still is over it, fine - if not trigger an 'mouseleave' event
[15:45:40] <Inoperable> thats it
[15:45:47] <Inoperable> sooo
[15:48:06] <Inoperable> anybody?
[15:49:08] <sunbeam> coldhead: hehe
[15:51:18] <dcherman> Inoperable: so rather than doing that, why not bind mouseenter and mouseleave handlers for the duration of the animation to track whether or not the mouse is still in the element.  in the complete callback of the animation, unbind them
[15:51:18] <dblosevn> i hate it when mice run over my lements
[15:52:28] <Inoperable> dcherman hmmm...
[15:52:47] <Inoperable> dcherman still kind of unelegant but you got a very good point here ;)
[15:53:46] <Inoperable> dcherman but i can't believe there isn't a simpler way to check out if the mouse is over an dom element or not
[15:53:54] <jehee> is it possible to rerun the content of a div using jquery? what if I have <div><?php echo 'hello'; ?></div>. Can I rerun it?
[15:54:18] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/5rVR8/1/
[15:54:26] <anew> anyone can help with this, trying to get an image preview here
[15:54:33] <anew> but not showing anything, what do i need to edit in append() ?
[15:55:10] <dcherman> Inoperable: checking the :hover pseudo is probably the simplest way in browsers that support it.  i dont think there's any API to get the current mouse position, so you need to do some manual tracking, or use the :hover pseudo
[15:56:15] <dblosevn> anew: code looks fine except your always attaching img/success.jpg to the preview panel
[15:56:27] <anew> yeah, but how do i attach the image that i upload?
[15:56:33] <anew> that's what i dont know
[15:57:05] <dblosevn> i didnt like that qquploader plugin gave me a lot of headaches before i switched to blueimps's jquery.imageupload
[15:57:15] <anew> :/
[15:57:16] <coldhead> you're*
[15:57:34] <anew> actually wtf u have to pay for this
[15:57:37] <dblosevn> it has a complete backend thats literally drop in
[15:57:38] <anew> gah
[15:57:51] <dblosevn> and its opensource licensed for personal or commercial
[15:58:29] <anew> the blueimp one i would have to customize so much
[15:58:39] <dblosevn> i spent about 15 minutes trying to implement blueimps plugin i spent a couple hours before i gave up trying to get qqfineuploader to do anything remotely close to what i wanted
[15:58:47] <anew> gah
[15:58:55] <dblosevn> well, not really
[15:59:06] <dblosevn> you could get what your asking for with about 4 lines of config
[15:59:26] <coldhead> you're*
[15:59:29] <anew> with blueimp
[15:59:32] <dblosevn> ya
[15:59:39] <dblosevn> thanks cold good lookin out
[15:59:50] <anew> so tired
[15:59:53] <anew> guess i will try that one then
[16:00:28] <coldhead> good luck anew

[16:01:03] <dblosevn> anew: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/123
[16:01:09] <dblosevn> theres my config i used recently
[16:01:13] <anew> such bullshit u have to pay for this other one, did you pay for it dblosevn ?
[16:02:02] <dblosevn> does way more then just show a preview implements a thumb preview, filesize, custom jqueryui progressbar, fileinfo such as actual dimensions etc filetype etc
[16:03:06] <dblosevn> anew: heres some markup to so you can see the structure i used
[16:03:08] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/124
[16:03:42] <anew> want to commit suicide
[16:03:59] <EdwardIII> hey... is there a way i can create my own header for a jquery dialog?
[16:04:05] <dblosevn> as mentioned my code does a lot more then you asked for, you could strip a ton out
[16:04:37] <EdwardIII> like, with twitter bootstrap you can just have data-dismiss="modal" on a button and that'll be your close button
[16:04:46] <EdwardIII> so you can just stick in your own header with that
[16:06:18] <coldhead> SOMETIMES IT WON'T COME SO EASY
[16:07:01] <EdwardIII> it rarely does with jquery ui
[16:36:45] <chovy> has anyone had an issue with .ready() firing in IE?
[16:37:00] <chovy> it is intermittent...but if i reload the page a lot, sometimes I don't get the event firing.
[16:38:12] <coldhead> i've never had that chovy
[16:38:20] <coldhead> it would be a show stopper if it were a real issue
[16:38:28] <coldhead> are you loading weirdly? like from local host?
[16:38:31] <coldhead> or with injected code?
[16:38:43] <coldhead> is the JS being included at the bottom of the page?
[16:39:07] <chovy> yeah, we have all kinds of weird shit loading js files.
[16:39:51] <coldhead> you might have better luck with load() rather than ready()?
[16:39:53] <chovy> i think its our code. but just wanted to be sure. the page is rendering, but i ahve a ready() function that adds the browser class to html. and it doesn't always get added in IE.
[16:39:57] <coldhead> that's gross but it might help
[16:40:27] <coldhead> can't you do that with conditional comments a la html5 boilerplate?
[17:02:43] <JelmerD> Hi there guys. I am running into a problem here while using a plugin (in my case: select2)
[17:05:25] <chinoto> JelmerD: Too Little Information needs to be a common abbreviation -_-
[17:05:55] <JelmerD> chinoto: I know, I was working on a pastebin, but pastebin is under heavy load, so it took a little longer ;)
[17:05:56] <JelmerD> http://pastebin.ca/2329223
[17:06:05] <JelmerD> My problem is as follows:
[17:06:19] <JelmerD> I want to access an attribute of the element where the plugin is applied to.
[17:07:10] <JelmerD> In my case; every element with the .select2 class should get the .select2 plugin applied to. But, in order to pupulate the data inside the options object, I want to use the data-options attribute of the element being used.
[17:07:48] <JelmerD> Why? Because I need to populate the data through php.
[17:08:17] <JelmerD> chinoto: I hope you have enough info now? And of course, I hope you can help me :)
[17:09:04] <JelmerD> For some reason I can not access $(this) in the options object. So I was hoping you guys know how to do that.
[17:11:53] <chinoto> still here, just testing&typing btw
[17:16:55] <chinoto> in the document ready function, test this: "console.log($('.select2').map(function() {$this=$(this);return [[this.tagName,$this.attr('data-options')||0]];}).get())"
[17:17:58] <wachpwnski> If you have an <li> element, how do you make it pop a div when you hover over it?
[17:18:48] <chinoto> wachpwnski: we considered (http://calebjacob.com/tooltipster/)
[17:19:01] <chinoto> haven't implemented it yet because of other things
[17:20:28] <chinoto> ctrl+w in the wrong window...
[17:21:16] <chinoto> first I close it via the window button, then this, ugh
[17:22:28] <offlim> does anyone know how i could calculate someone age by year and month? for example someone born 1948-9-6 would be 64 years and 6 months old?
[17:23:18] <wachpwnski> chinoto: just looking for something simple
[17:24:46] <JelmerD> chinoto: ok, going to test it. Thanks for your time :)
[17:24:49] <chinoto> offlim: if you can parse the date into something (new Date(date)) can understand, then you can just do some simple subtraction from the current date and divide
[17:25:14] <chinoto> wachpwnski: in that case, how does it need to work
[17:25:41] <wachpwnski> just on hover over pop a div up with text in it based on the class
[17:26:23] <wachpwnski> so like $('.class').hover( /* spawn a div with text in it and dispose on leaving */ );
[17:26:28] <JelmerD> chinoto: I am getting an array back. I guess that is what you expected, but how to use this? I don't know what to do next?
[17:27:17] <chinoto> JelmerD: is the second element of each inner array what you expect them to be? that is what we're checking
[17:28:54] <JelmerD> chinoto: Yes, I get back "INPUT" and my data which will be converted to an object by eval().
[17:29:31] <chinoto> well at least it's working as expected as far as that goes
[17:30:17] <JelmerD> To make things clear. It works perfectly fine when I set a var data = $('.select2').attr('data-options'); above the .select({}) and use that data variable. But that messes up everything when using several input elements with this classname.
[17:31:01] <JelmerD> So I am trying to access the calling element, the element where .select2({}) is applied to. So $('.select2').select2({me: $(this)});
[17:31:25] <JelmerD> In that last snippet, $(this) should refer to the calling element. Or any other variable that I should use. I don't know how to access the requesting element.
[17:31:41] <JelmerD> Maybe that clears up some stuff chinoto?
[17:34:06] <chinoto> give me an example of what of these attribute
[17:34:25] <chinoto> actually don;t
[17:34:36] <chinoto> it's obvious now
[17:36:23] <chinoto> replace "<CHAIN>" with the chain after "$('.select2')" in the code I'm about to post
[17:36:55] <chinoto> $('.select2').each(function() {$(this).<CHAIN>});
[17:38:08] <chinoto> the reason is that the object is evaluated once and passed to the select2() function and is actually referring to "document"
[17:39:12] <chinoto> JelmerD: above
[17:39:32] <JelmerD> I will have a look and try it. Sec
[17:41:09] <JelmerD> chinoto: I love you
[17:41:16] <chinoto> awww
[17:41:46] <JelmerD> chinoto: This has been bugging me since 00:00. It is 03:00 now ...
[17:41:48] <JelmerD> So I am happy
[17:42:17] <chinoto> simplest of things can be the hardest :D
[17:42:46] <chinoto> and yet the harder things end up being simple to code
[17:42:49] <JelmerD> chinoto: Yes, I was about to throw my laptop through the window. But then I realised: maybe there is a jQuery IRC.
[17:43:09] <chinoto> there's a channel for every niche
[17:43:42] <JelmerD> Yeah I know, I just didn't come up with it for some reason.
[17:43:56] <chinoto> I asked a question in #suse since that is the distro I use about a hypothetical grub question, then I asked #grub, it took 2 minutes for them to answer
[17:44:08] <JelmerD> I have been in this channel earlier, but then I got myself a new VPS, so my IRC bouncer wasn't there anymore.
[17:44:18] <JelmerD> Simply forgot about the channel.
[17:44:35] <chinoto> you can get a list of channels and users
[17:44:47] <chinoto> well, a user count for each channel anyway
[17:45:15] <JelmerD> chinoto: use /list channels
[17:45:39] <chinoto> I don't understand why that isn't cached on the irc server, it takes so long for it to come up
[17:45:41] <JelmerD> Most of the times I just /join channel-x and hope anybody is around :p
[17:45:49] <JelmerD> I am op of a lot of channels :p
[17:47:28] <chinoto> list flooded my #suse tab from half a second of it being active
[17:48:59] <chinoto> I opened another channel tab to test /list, then decided to see if anything was going on in the #suse tab, it continued flooding in that tab -_-
[17:50:55] <JelmerD> chinoto: you are on freenode website?
[17:51:06] <JelmerD> Why don't you use a client? KVIrc for example?
[17:51:19] <coldhead> or erc-mode in emacs
[17:52:42] <chinoto> I use xchat, it works great
[17:53:20] <chinoto> I've always used the guified version of list, which is a lot nicer to work with
[17:54:49] <chinoto> wachpwnski: forgot about you :3
[17:55:05] <chinoto> I'll write up something quick I think should work
[17:59:37] <zeropx> I have an element with a listener that does an ajax call on the form. I have no access to the current js, but want to append another action after the current javascript listener has been triggered. How can do that?
[18:00:20] <chinoto> does it have to happen afte the ajax call has finished?
[18:01:03] <zeropx> chinoto: yes, I tried to attach it as another listener in general but it blows away my update after the ajax has loaded its content
[18:01:23] <victorbjelkholm> zeropx, have you tried using live()?
[18:01:39] <zeropx> victorbjelkholm: nope, i'll look into that
[18:01:40] <chinoto> live is deprecated, use on()
[18:01:50] <zeropx> I just read about that too kidna. :D
[18:01:54] <chinoto> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:01:56] <victorbjelkholm> oh, that's right, always mix those up
[18:02:04] <greg5green> live is deprecated
[18:02:12] <chinoto> greg5green: -_-
[18:02:15] <greg5green> nm, you'all beat me
[18:02:16] <greg5green> :(
[18:02:30] <chinoto> oh :P
[18:02:44] <zeropx> hehe
[18:02:44] <greg5green> i guess my life is deprecated
[18:02:47] <greg5green> might as well /part
[18:02:53] <greg5green> :D
[18:03:00] <chinoto> nooo *wavy hands*
[18:04:35] <chinoto> how about setting a random attribute on an element within the element and every 200ms or so, check if t is still there
[18:04:59] <greg5green> that sounds incredibly inefficient
[18:05:04] <chinoto> agreed
[18:05:14] <greg5green> poor mobile users
[18:05:20] <chinoto> I don't believe there is a good way to go about this, unless you can get dom modification events
[18:05:41] <chinoto> or an ajax event...
[18:06:03] <greg5green> does jquery have something like dojo's aspect?
[18:06:05] <greg5green> maybe?
[18:06:25] <JelmerD> chinoto: didn't know live() was deprecated. Tnx :)
[18:06:26] <greg5green> basically sets up an event to run after a function runs
[18:06:55] <greg5green> blech, doesnt sound like it
[18:08:30] <chinoto> actually, is the function that is run named or a variable that you can access?
[18:09:19] <chinoto> if so you could assign the function to another name and replace the original with a wrapper function
[18:09:52] <chinoto> and just pass the arguments variable to the renamed function
[18:10:15] <greg5green> zeropx, are you working in the same namespace as the function you cant edit?
[18:10:21] <greg5green> maybe you can exploit hoisting?
[18:10:55] <zeropx> greg5green: after some looking around, I think needed to use .ajaxSuccess
[18:10:58] <zeropx> bout to refresh and find out
[18:12:13] <rushainem> Has any one here every made a content slider similar to what is on the www.hulu.com homepage in 'trending now' section
[18:12:40] <chinoto> don't you need to get the deferred object that ajax function return before calling ajaxSuccess?
[18:12:57] <chinoto> and isn't that deprecated for done()?
[18:13:14] <zeropx> chinoto: I only wanted to call an action upon a successful ajax load
[18:13:25] <greg5green> chinoto, docs say you can pull the xhr object into the ajaxSuccess method
[18:13:34] <zeropx> That was my solution actually to use .ajaxSuccess.
[18:14:01] <rushainem> I'm trying to figure out how to approach creating a slider that which x-number of divs at a time and display more once you click the directional arrow
[18:14:34] <greg5green> there's * plugins out there to do that sort of thing for you
[18:14:40] <greg5green> or you could write your own code to do it
[18:14:41] <zeropx> It worked exactly as I wanted. Essentily I have limited access to the code base in areas of this site and jquery is the only thing I can use to do the manipulation I wanted. My previous was basically showing a div upon click. But in reality I just wanted that div to show up only after the content was loaded.
[18:15:19] <zeropx> chinoto: greg5green victorbjelkholm  all of your comments did help steer in the direction for what to look for.
[18:15:27] <zeropx> Suppose sometimes its just real hard coming up with the right question.
[18:15:40] <victorbjelkholm> zeropx, glad I could help somehow :)
[18:15:41] <greg5green> almost got there
[18:15:43] <greg5green> :)
[18:15:58] <greg5green> ajaxSuccess is kind of like an aspect, except only for ajax calls
[18:16:07] <chinoto> I confused ajaxSuccess with the deferred object specific success()
[18:16:09] <rushainem> I would rather code my since some of the plugins I've seen so far will only display 1 when I looking to display it based on the size of the page
[18:16:10] <greg5green> glad I know thats there now
[18:16:15] <chinoto> or figured it was an alias
[18:16:21] <Marlie769> hey
[18:16:55] <greg5green> rushainem, to get you started, you basically just lay out one big long row of items
[18:16:59] <greg5green> set the overflow to hidden
[18:17:05] <chinoto> been fun, I'm gonna ignore y'all for the most part now :P
[18:17:19] <greg5green> on the parent and also set a width on the parent
[18:17:20] <Marlie769> hey everyone :)
[18:17:31] <zeropx> thank you guys for helping!
[18:17:50] <greg5green> then you can either animate the left property or the margin of the first-child to move items thru it
[18:17:55] <greg5green> (thats one way at least)
[18:17:59] <greg5green> hi Marlie769
[18:18:16] <Marlie769> never been to chat like this before... its really cool lol
[18:18:27] <greg5green> really?
[18:18:30] <Marlie769> yeah
[18:18:43] <Marlie769> just looked it up tonight to see if it exists, and it does
[18:18:47] <greg5green> because people are talking technical things or that people can talk a lot lol
[18:18:49] <Marlie769> haha
[18:18:54] <chinoto> actually I'm just gonna leave... otherwise I'll get to distracted and never finish getting virtualgl working, let alone getting it working on my raspberry pi
[18:19:06] <Marlie769> lol
[18:19:10] <rushainem> thanks greg5green  Would the overflow:hidden & width would go on the parent container div of the big long row of items?
[18:19:16] <Marlie769> yeah, i can talk techie but also talk "normal" lol
[18:19:22] <greg5green> yes, rushainem, it would
[18:19:49] <Marlie769> greg5green, you a developer?
[18:19:52] <greg5green> yes
[18:19:55] <Marlie769> me too
[18:20:00] <greg5green> cool, where in NC?
[18:20:06] <Marlie769> garner
[18:20:13] <greg5green> Ah, I was in Raleigh for a while
[18:20:17] <greg5green> you familiar with capstrat?
[18:20:19] <Marlie769> yeah?
[18:20:25] <Marlie769> no, never heard of it
[18:20:28] <greg5green> ah
[18:20:33] <greg5green> its a communications firm in raleigh
[18:20:35] <greg5green> worked there for a while
[18:20:38] <Marlie769> oh nice
[18:20:42] <Marlie769> did u like it?
[18:20:49] <greg5green> yes i did
[18:20:52] <coldhead> are you sure it's not a bare handed brazilian fighting technique?
[18:20:55] <Marlie769> whyd you leave lol
[18:21:02] <greg5green> moved to ohio to be closer to family
[18:21:07] <coldhead> aw
[18:21:10] <Marlie769> aahh yeah, that's a good reason
[18:21:12] <coldhead> <3 OH
[18:21:20] <Marlie769> i moved from NJ
[18:21:26] <Marlie769> there isn't much out there in the IT field
[18:21:37] <Marlie769> my friend is a dba just out of high school.... its insane.
[18:21:41] <Marlie769> he has my dream job lol
[18:22:04] <veQue> Marlie769: thought about moving?
[18:22:13] <Marlie769> to virginia lol
[18:22:21] <Marlie769> there are a lot of jobs out here where i am
[18:22:27] <Marlie769> problem is that people like experience
[18:22:45] <Marlie769> but sometimes people just don't know how much sql i know... and it's hard to show/tell them without having it on paper.
[18:22:46] <rushainem> greg5green: what's the difference between animating the left property or the margin of the first-child to move items
[18:22:48] <rushainem> ?
[18:23:16] <veQue> Marlie769: are you good with databases?
[18:23:30] <Marlie769> yeah, really good
[18:23:51] <greg5green> Marlie769, I think the triangle is a lot about networking, not experience
[18:23:57] <greg5green> (from my experiences anyways :P)
[18:23:57] <Marlie769> im not an expert, but i can design them with no problem by hand
[18:24:01] <Marlie769> really?
[18:24:06] <Marlie769> i've heard that..
[18:24:08] <veQue> Marlie769: well you should be fine
[18:24:19] <Marlie769> i mean i work now, i don't make what i should
[18:24:31] <greg5green> rushainem, functionally? no difference
[18:24:36] <Marlie769> but im trying to look for a new position in the database area (that's where im strong in)
[18:24:43] <veQue> Marlie769: hmm
[18:25:05] <veQue> you got a linkedin?
[18:25:09] <Marlie769> i do
[18:25:37] <Marlie769> let me get u the link, 1 sec
[18:25:50] <tw2113> wow, real linkedin users
[18:25:54] <tw2113> i thought they were all bots
[18:25:58] <veQue> well Marlie769 that's all the advice i can muster
[18:26:11] <veQue> promote yourself
[18:26:18] <Marlie769> right
[18:26:28] <Marlie769> at my job now im trying to do that
[18:26:35] <rushainem> greg5green: ok but its sounds like this approach would only slide through 1 div at a time when I would like to move all the div items that are show in that current viewed slider state
[18:26:35] <Marlie769> im trying to teach other people what i know...
[18:26:45] <greg5green> "After 2.5 years i finally have my closure" <-- just saw someone write that on FB... Almost wrote a witty function before I realized the person wouldnt understand closures in js
[18:26:47] <Marlie769> but i also don't want to make myself unvaluable, ya know
[18:27:12] <greg5green> rushainem, you float them all to the left
[18:27:31] <greg5green> so that when you adjust the position of the first div, all the others move with it
[18:27:34] <veQue> Marlie769what happens when you appy?
[18:28:28] <veQue> if you have the skills, no way any company would skim over you easily
[18:28:30] <Marlie769> well either nothing happens or they say i don't have enough .net or c# experience
[18:28:40] <Marlie769> im trying to get away from the development roll and get into more a dba job
[18:28:44] <Marlie769> i can do sql all day
[18:29:06] <Marlie769> that interests me, and that's what im good at. i can do jquery, html, and all that stuff, but it doesn't interest me like sql dos
[18:29:08] <Marlie769> does*
[18:29:22] <Marlie769> and i feel like not too many people can design a "proper" database
[18:31:08] <veQue> hmmm
[18:31:23] <Marlie769> are you in the raleigh area?
[18:31:58] <veQue> nope, nor do i have advance dba skills
[18:32:03] <rushainem> greg5green: ok
[18:32:18] <Marlie769> i could teach you lol
[18:32:33] <veQue> i'm just trying to think how can someone in your position get somewhere?
[18:32:48] <veQue> like what would be the first steps?
[18:32:54] <Marlie769> do you mean like.. im getting myself into too much of a niche?
[18:32:56] <veQue> Marlie769: try an internship?
[18:33:03] <Marlie769> i work right now
[18:33:13] <Marlie769> and im a developer, problem is that i don't do enough sql
[18:33:21] <Marlie769> and the sql i do isn't advanced... at least to me it isn't
[18:33:28] <Marlie769> it isn't a challenge
[18:33:29] <veQue> i'm saying you have skills there should be a way to find you the right company
[18:33:49] <Marlie769> oohhh ok, i thought you meant that i was looking for too much of a niche lol
[18:34:06] <Marlie769> well, can i tell ya something and hopefullu you dont judge me lol
[18:41:34] <greg5green> apparently not
[18:44:40] <veQue> *shrugs*
[18:44:40] <b-ot> veQue: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:45:27] <rmill> b-ot: You gonna stop shruggin?
[18:45:28] <b-ot> rmill: ask again later.
[18:45:34] <rmill> >:[
[18:54:49] <msoa> can anyone help me? https://forum.jquery.com/topic/what-does-mean-arguments-of-ajaxerror-function-event-xhr-options-exc
[18:59:34] <JelmerD> msoa: don't know from the head. But try console.log() on each of the arguments and see what you get.
[19:03:26] <Marlie769> hey
[19:03:58] <Marlie769> if i want to append either one of many items to a table, is it better to use a json string or array(s)?
[19:04:55] <msoa> JelmerD: Thanks
[19:10:51] <greg5green> I dont know what you mean Marlie769
[19:11:03] <Marlie769> like...
[19:11:10] <Marlie769> i have a form that a user inputs stuff
[19:11:13] <Marlie769> it's a to do list.
[19:11:33] <Marlie769> and when the user i done inputting information, i click a button and i want that text to do into a table
[19:11:44] <Marlie769> and when i add another task, it goes in under it.
[19:12:04] <Marlie769> and i didn't know the best approach to do that.
[19:12:47] <greg5green> ok
[19:13:03] <tw2113> either would work
[19:13:12] <greg5green> Id just take the values of the form inputs
[19:13:19] <greg5green> and place them in the data places
[19:13:24] <Marlie769> data places?
[19:13:31] <greg5green> yes, where you want to put that info
[19:13:31] <greg5green> lol
[19:13:31] <Marlie769> like an array?
[19:13:38] <rushainem> greg5green: do you know any  customizable plugins that could do content slide for me?
[19:13:49] <Marlie769> well would LOVE to save it to a database, but i don't know php
[19:13:58] <Marlie769> so i guess an array for now lol
[19:14:20] <greg5green> "<td>I'm" + blarg.value + "and I like to " blarg2.value ".</td>"
[19:14:27] <greg5green> (I'm missing a + there, but whatever
[19:14:51] <greg5green> rushainem, no sorry
[19:15:08] <greg5green> (also missing a ) on that last note, so full of fail)
[19:16:16] <rushainem> greg5green: its alright. Can you walk me through animatiing  the left property ? That's where I'm stuck right now
[19:16:48] <greg5green> sorry, no
[19:16:53] <greg5green> about to go to bed
[19:16:57] <Marlie769> i guess im just stuck lol
[19:17:11] <greg5green> check jquery ui's animate function
[19:19:27] <greg5green> night
[19:19:30] <Marlie769> night
[19:19:42] <rushainem> night
[19:21:00] <ryorky1> hey guys, what would cause the following error:  Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'live'
[19:22:58] <tw2113> are you on jQuery 1.9?
[19:23:11] <ryorky1> yes I believe so
[19:23:16] <tw2113> then live() is gone

[19:32:57] <Kichael> I have 3 forms on a page and I have some handlers bound with on to the ajax:complete, problem is when I submit just one form, the code is run three times, how can I make it only run once since only one of the forms is being submitted?
[19:36:19] <inv3nt0r_> Hi everyone... Just a quick question here. I'm building a shopping cart of sorts, and I need to pass the contents of the quantity picker to the appropriate add to cart button. Each of my quantity fields has a unique id, as does its add to cart button. I am using the 'keyup' handler which detects the change perfectly, but I'm wondering if the handler will tell me which input box has been changed?
[19:41:21] <solarflares> hiii
[19:50:06] <puneet> Hello I have a site http://demo.it-consultis.com/villebois/ with server protection user:itc pass:2013
[19:50:44] <coldhead> congratulations, puneet !
[19:50:51] <puneet> WHen I click on the thumbs title below the slider the menu item pointer dont move according to the page
[19:51:04] <solarflares> hey coldhead
[19:51:22] <solarflares> so today i came across localecompare and then i found this http://jsperf.com/operator-vs-localcompare
[19:51:25] <puneet> coldhead: Can you help me in correcting my js
[19:52:16] <puneet> coldhead : here is my script http://pastebin.com/8PBTc6An
[19:52:41] <Stampy> Hi.  I'm hitting a REST service that is returning JSON.  I'm using a .ajax call with dataType = "JSON", and when the response status code is a 200 level code everything works fine, but it seems the .fail function doesn't return me the respone object. Why isn't this included?  Is there a way to get access to this object?  If not, how am I supposed to do operations based on what the response was?
[19:52:50] <solarflares> the data seems kind of weird though, the comparison operator performed slower it seems in earlier builds even though I think the localecompare fnction gives a different return value if they are equal
[19:53:16] <coldhead> solarflares: interesting, i've never heard of this method
[19:53:27] <solarflares> i hadn't either until today
[19:54:21] <solarflares> ooh thats weird
[19:54:33] <solarflares> in firefox it returns -2 0 2 and in webkit its -1 0 1
[19:55:41] <puneet> Can anybody help me in working the script correctly?
[19:56:02] <solarflares> for there is a newer revision of those benchmarks apparently
[19:58:11] <coldhead> puneet: you haven't described the problem
[19:58:16] <coldhead> i found the code
[19:58:23] <coldhead> i can't see the elements i should be clicking
[19:58:32] <puneet> coldhead: Have you opened the site?
[19:58:33] <coldhead> when i trigger click() manually i see an alert
[19:58:41] <msoa> I have this code:
[19:58:42] <coldhead> and now i'm bored
[19:58:44] <msoa>     $(document).ajaxError(function(event,xhr,options,exc){
[19:58:44] <msoa>         console.log(arguments);
[19:58:44] <msoa>     });
[19:58:44] <msoa> where can i see result of "console.log"?
[19:58:46] <coldhead> better luck next time
[19:58:54] <coldhead> msoa: in the Web Inspector console tab
[19:59:00] <coldhead> or Firebug if you have that installed in Firefox
[19:59:11] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ msoa
[19:59:15] <Eviltwin> ...
[19:59:20] <Eviltwin> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[19:59:22] <coldhead> botless
[19:59:23] <Eviltwin> REad that
[19:59:24] <abjorn> http://imgur.com/gallery/2HwoVfH i think this was the only good thing to come out of our 9 hour agile training at work
[19:59:32] <coldhead> you're quicker than the damn bot anyway Evilsy <3
[19:59:53] <puneet> coldhead: actually when you click on the thumb links the pointer below on the menu items is not moving to the correct menu item
[20:00:28] <msoa> coldhead: like firebug?
[20:00:43] <coldhead> it looks right to me puneet
[20:00:48] <coldhead> msoa yes like firebug
[20:00:57] <coldhead> but if you have chrome Web Inspector comes with it
[20:01:02] <msoa> very thanks
[20:01:09] <coldhead> which is convenient
[20:01:10] <puneet> coldhead: but its not moving to the correct place on clicking the link
[20:01:29] <puneet> coldhead: its moving when you hover upon the menu
[20:01:51] <puneet> I need it to move when we click on the link
[20:01:57] <coldhead> puneet: when i hover i see it in the right place
[20:02:05] <coldhead> and when i click... i see it in the right place
[20:02:09] <coldhead> the same right place
[20:02:23] <coldhead> that's AFTER i've had to zoom out on the page just to see the footer
[20:02:34] <coldhead> because you are designing for cinema screens apparently
[20:02:53] <coldhead> it is difficult for me to fix it if i can't reproduce it
[20:03:01] <coldhead> and i'm not super interested in reproducing it
[20:03:07] <coldhead> because i just took a whole bunch of pills
[20:03:22] <puneet> coldhead: :)
[20:04:07] <puneet> coldhead: can you give me some idea to how to get the correct left position and width of the main menu active item?
[20:04:21] <coldhead> can't you just do the same as in the hover?
[20:04:26] <coldhead> isn't that working right?
[20:04:38] <coldhead> BORED NOW
[20:05:54] <solarflares> i should learn backbone
[20:06:10] <puneet> coldhead: no I've used exactly the same but didnt got right
[20:06:32] <coldhead> puneet: it got right for me in chromium
[20:06:42] <coldhead> is $(this) something different to what you expect?
[20:06:50] <coldhead> are you using a different selector?
[20:07:20] <coldhead> puneet: does it work if you do $('.your selector').click(function () { $(this).trigger('mouseover'); } ) ?
[20:07:39] <coldhead> do you even NEED the click? doesn't the hover move it for you?
[20:08:38] <puneet> coldhead: I dont want to hover the menu to get the pointer on the right place.....I need the pointer to go to the right place when we click on the thumb title above the menu
[20:08:42] <vladikoff> solarflares, http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3t9sdx/
[20:09:08] <coldhead> oh
[20:09:28] <coldhead> puneet: you need a way to associate a thumbnail with the entry in the footer
[20:09:37] <coldhead> you could use index() if they're in the same order
[20:10:36] <puneet> have you seen my code that I've wrote to accomplish this task coldhead?
[20:11:19] <coldhead> yes but i closed your site when i started getting terribly bored
[20:11:50] <puneet> coldhead: Can you please reopen the site to help me out please
[20:12:35] <coldhead> i am so bored i am going to do some paperwork instead
[20:12:38] <coldhead> ask someone else
[20:12:47] <coldhead> Eviltwin is very clever and patient and loving
[20:13:57] <puneet> coldhead: ok thanks for your cooperation and help :)
[20:16:27] <MACscr> any ideas why line 13 in the js isnt firing off when i click on the "I'm New" link? http://jsfiddle.net/YehpW/7/
[20:17:41] <MACscr> the "#nav-main li.parent-menu-item a:first-child" seems to be correct when applying the css
[20:18:45] <vladikoff> MACscr, 'parent-menu-item' missing in html
[20:19:06] <vladikoff> MACscr, wait nvm
[20:19:46] <MACscr> you can see on line 19 of the css that its working when you look at the output
[20:20:11] <MACscr> js doesnt seem to play well with that same group of selectrs
[20:22:58] <vladikoff> MACscr, it works if you resize the window
[20:23:35] <MACscr> ah, doh!  you are right. hmm
[20:23:39] <vladikoff> MACscr, you don't call adjustMenu() on load, only on resize and orientation
[20:24:57] <MACscr> basically i only want to call the jquery on the menu if its being used on lower resolution devices. Thats easy in css.Think im going the right way about doing it for js?
[20:28:34] <ryorky1> does anybody know of any good modal popups that are friendly w/ jquery 1.9?
[20:38:27] <binaryfus10nz_> ryorky1, why not just build your own
[20:38:44] <binaryfus10nz_> a handful of CSS and JS no?
[20:39:14] <coldhead> the jquery UI one should be pretty friendly with 1.9
[20:39:15] <boytoy> http://bit.ly/Y4Z7BZ -- trying to do like Instagram's effects slider but based on http://swipejs.com/ -- anybody know what I'm missing though?

[21:13:44] <imsky> enjoy ubuntu!
[21:14:01] <obert> ubuntu sux: there are bugs: i dont see no files in my pc
[21:14:16] <imsky> oh that's easily fixed
[21:14:19] <obert> must be about ubuntu
[21:14:44] <coldhead> sudo apt-get install jquery
[21:15:17] <obert> coldhead: stop that, linux is for real men
[21:15:22] <obert> not for women
[21:15:33] <coldhead> that's... quite offensive really
[21:15:34] <imsky> why not for women
[21:15:50] <obert> it was an excuse to continue the joke
[21:15:55] <imsky> yeah you see
[21:15:57] <imsky> comedy is for men
[21:15:59] <imsky> not for women
[21:16:00] <coldhead> i seem to remember ubuntu were flamed for having naked women on some of their promo stuff
[21:16:05] <tw2113> ha, there's some jQuery packages in Fedora 16
[21:16:13] <imsky> ha you're using fedora 16
[21:16:14] <coldhead> and they were like "but ubuntu is for all people, men and women, clothed and naked"
[21:16:17] <tw2113> mostly drupal7 based
[21:16:24] <obert> coldhead: ubuntu 6 cd cover?;)
[21:16:25] <tw2113> better than Ubuntu
[21:16:30] <imsky> hmmm
[21:17:04] <coldhead> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Ubuntu_6.06_LTS_CDs.png
[21:17:10] <obert> i am sure that ubuntu means 'i dunno how to install debian'
[21:17:10] <coldhead> that's not what i was thinking of, no
[21:17:21] <tw2113> i should upgrade to F18 sometime soon
[21:17:24] <imsky> no naked women i feel duped
[21:17:48] <ryanneufeld> imsky: who let you back in
[21:18:06] <obert> my leg is more bugged than any os
[21:18:17] <obert> what a boring time
[21:19:18] <solarflares> i just bought FTL
[21:19:20] <solarflares> pretty cool so far
[21:19:40] <LocalPCGuy> #!
[21:19:46] <obert> ftl stands for?
[21:20:11] <LocalPCGuy> oh, sorry were we bashing other linux distro's while listing the ones we use?
[21:20:26] * tw2113 bets coldhead bought ubuntu once
[21:21:11] <coldhead> i bought it a bunch of times
[21:21:45] <coldhead> ah race conditions <3
[21:22:21] <obert> and anyway let me say every blessed pum pum
[21:22:22] <solarflares> obert: http://vimeo.com/47066972#at=0 thats a trailer for the game its called faster than light
[21:22:25] <solarflares> its a space game
[21:22:47] <solarflares> and some of it is going to be inspiration for 0x10c probably since notch plays ftl quite a bit
[21:23:06] <obert> ah ok solarflares sorry last game i'd played was pacman
[21:23:30] <obert> and for anybody who want to troll me: qbert too:p
[21:23:35] <solarflares> oh its like an arcade style game
[21:23:37] <obert> troll/kidding
[21:23:53] <tw2113> no "A Boy and His Blob" ?
[21:24:07] <obert> blob?

[21:26:50] <obert> nothing more perhaps
[21:27:44] <solarflares> these games are so much fun and they're only like 10 dollars
[21:28:23] <obert> pacman is recently redo in html5 and jquery ;)
[21:28:33] <obert> is/was (uff)
[21:29:05] <solarflares> line rider was recently done with canvas
[21:29:15] <solarflares> they called it canvasrider
[21:29:23] <imsky> gotta check that out
[21:31:36] <imsky> so addictive
[21:32:50] <solarflares> yeah i suggest sorting by popular tracks
[21:33:59] <boytoy> coldhead: whats cray cray?
[21:34:17] <obert> i never won more than 2 levels on pacman
[21:34:22] <obert> since '91
[21:34:41] <boytoy> imsky: she coulda meant cay's cray.. music from the south pacific.. not bad actually check it out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SveqAY9tZ24
[21:34:55] <imsky> she?
[21:35:07] <obert> hehe again
[21:35:08] <boytoy> new zealand actually but genetically the same people as tonga
[21:42:22] <LocalPCGuy> anyone a git guru - how do I go about unmerging something I merged using rebase?
[21:43:00] <Cork> LocalPCGuy: you don't
[21:43:09] <LocalPCGuy> :(
[21:43:11] <Cork> you reset the repo to the pre merge revision
[21:43:20] <Cork> then you do what you want to do differently
[21:43:48] <obert> rm is the solution for everything
[21:43:55] <Cork> uh
[21:44:36] <Cork> no just git reset --hard <old commit id>
[21:47:25] <gaf> hey, lil question for the jquery pros. are you able to make a living only writting jquery or you cannot avoid front end tasks such ashtml/css?
[21:48:27] <Cork> gaf: you will get sub-par results if you split that up too much
[21:48:43] <gaf> i'm trying to run from css
[21:49:01] <gaf> Cork, that was my worry
[21:49:05] <Cork> as far as i've seen there is two options either your lucky and have a designer that makes the html + css
[21:49:14] <Cork> and you just have to modify it and write the backend code
[21:49:24] <Cork> or you need to do the front end from an image
[21:49:41] <obert> gaf: usually a frontender is required to know well html, css and js
[21:49:50] <obert> i mean very well
[21:50:17] <Cork> gaf: so basically it depends on what kind of designer you can get your hand on
[21:50:50] <obert> if you are searching for apply as designer, you can just do mockups and such
[21:50:58] <Cork> but either way, you will need to know css and html either way, or you will be a handcuffed javascript developer
[21:51:34] <gaf> i know html and css very well. i was studying the past year vanilla js
[21:52:26] <obert> here they require pure js at least
[21:52:39] <obert> frameworks are optional
[21:52:48] <rmurphey> Irssi 0.8.11 (20070425) - http://irssi.org/ end
[21:53:00] <rmurphey> sorry
[21:53:30] * coldhead Likes this.
[21:54:32] <gaf> man, i studied 1 year js and was dabbling 2 with css/html to find out i don't want to be a front end developer :/
[21:54:39] <gaf> it is just lamme
[21:55:10] <gaf> i like oop programming and alghoritms now, that i learnt js
[21:55:15] <obert> find your specialization is a very good move
[21:55:41] <coldhead> you can still use that JS knowledge to do serverside stuff in node.js
[21:55:50] <coldhead> AND front-end guys will love that your html doesn't suck
[21:56:03] <rmurphey> yes if css and html bores you there's still plenty to do with js
[21:56:06] <obert> i just meant that html and css without any js knowledge are not enought to be hired as front ender
[21:56:06] <gaf> coldhead, bingo, that is what i'm thinking
[21:56:25] <LocalPCGuy> gaf it varies from place to place, but I find it depends on how the business handles the designers - are they strictly PS gurus from the print world - well, you'll be slinging some HTML/CSS
[21:57:31] <rmurphey> designers?
[21:57:35] <rmurphey> i mean
[21:57:48] <rmurphey> there's a lot more to "front end dev" than design :)
[21:57:55] <gaf> mm, i thought so. i think i will follow coldhead suggestion and dive into node, so i can reuse my knowledge
[21:57:59] <coldhead> i do front end dev and i can't design shit
[21:58:08] <rmurphey> dive into node, ember, angular
[21:58:18] <coldhead> ANG YOU LARR
[21:58:20] <obert> gaf: i know people were searchin for backbone.js dev ;)
[21:58:21] <LocalPCGuy> yah ,I can't design a square box
[21:59:09] <obert> LocalPCGuy: .square { width: 10em; height: 10em; }
[21:59:20] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[21:59:32] <obert> see? no js
[22:00:34] <obert> sometimes i am funny
[22:01:54] <obert> and other times i should really try to get some sleep
[22:16:21] <solarflares> http://www.armadillow.com/
[22:16:46] <solarflares> so im looking for a good cookware set
[22:43:09] <solarflares> what do you know woot has a cookware set
[22:44:06] <Cork> solarflares: please don't spam
[22:44:23] <solarflares> im not
[22:44:41] <snover> Cork: please don't spam
[22:44:41] <Cork> your talking about cookware in a developer channel for jquery; yes you are
[22:45:00] <solarflares> off-topic discussion seems pretty common here
[22:45:05] <solarflares> so not spam
[22:49:03] <solarflares> plus having good cookware is essential to good development
[22:49:46] <snover> that logic seems watertight
[22:49:59] <Cork> its cookware after all
[22:50:12] <Cork> it should be watertight, else it would be really bad cookware
[23:11:58] <raj> I got an email with a countdown clock. Upon inspection, the clock was a .png file on the sender's website
[23:12:01] <raj> how did they do this?
[23:12:09] <raj> do they keep changing the .png file every second?
[23:12:23] <Cork> most likely ya
[23:12:35] <raj> how does the email "reload" the image?
[23:12:37] <Cork> and you should prob disable remote images in your emails
[23:12:45] <Cork> its a really good way to track you
[23:12:56] <raj> I'm aware, I almost never clikc "View images"
[23:13:07] <raj> but I did in this case, and glad I did to discover this cool trick
[23:13:18] <raj> so how are they refreshing the .png image?
[23:13:19] <Cork> they just have a value in the url that makes it avoid the cache
[23:13:30] <Cork> or they set cache: no-cache in the http header
[23:13:54] <Cork> btw what are you using to view the email?
[23:13:58] <raj> gmail
[23:14:05] <Cork> what browser?
[23:14:15] <raj> so if no-cache is set, it'll keep requesting the static file?
[23:14:18] <raj> chrome
[23:14:27] <Cork> hmm so no apng then
[23:14:42] <Cork> not sure, only thing i can think of is js
[23:14:50] <raj> but that's not allowed in emails
[23:15:11] <Cork> raj: view the source of the email, and inspect the http header
[23:15:21] <Cork> those are the only two way they can do it
[23:16:56] <raj> Cork, the Email's header, right?
[23:17:05] <Cork> raj: no the raw email
[23:17:17] <Cork> and the http header from the image request
[23:17:54] <Cork> for example make sure that the mimetype is image/png and not image/gif
[23:18:03] <Cork> as whats in the url doesn't matter
[23:18:25] <raj> <img alt="Display images to show real-time content" border="0" cm_dontimportimage="true" src="http://www.movable-ink-7978.com/p/rp/1bd6ce576807450f.png" width="495" height="107" style="font-family: Arial; color: #ffffff; font-size: 12px; display:block">
[23:18:36] <Cork> thats the html
[23:18:40] <raj> yeah
[23:18:50] <Cork> that doesn't matter much
[23:19:27] <Cork> raj: just as an example http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home

[23:22:29] <raj> Cork, http://paste.ofcode.org/wxAEd3C4UbxkFudUbxJwrR
[23:22:55] <Cork> raj: X-Server-Filename: 3232_original.gif
[23:22:57] <Cork> :)
[23:23:05] <dblosevn> i spilled coke on my laptop :-(
[23:23:11] <Cork> also Content-Type:image/gif
[23:23:15] <raj> Cork, how does that work?
[23:23:20] <raj> why is pointing at a .png then?
[23:23:24] <Cork> its not
[23:23:24] <raj> *it
[23:23:33] <raj> Request URL:http://www.movable-ink-7978.com/p/rp/1bd6ce576807450f.png
[23:23:40] <raj> it's requesting a URL that a .png
[23:23:57] <Cork> raj: the resource just happens to have the ascii characters '.', 'p', 'n' and 'g' at the end
[23:24:08] <Cork> raj: many mistakes the url for a file path
[23:24:10] <Cork> its not
[23:24:21] <Cork> its a resource request location
[23:24:30] <Cork> its up to the server to locate what it is
[23:24:39] <Cork> and the content-type defines what it returns
[23:24:49] <Cork> the url means nothing when it comes to what it is
[23:25:16] <dblosevn> ya you could mimemap .html to application/pdf and the browser would think a web page was a pdf
[23:25:29] <Cork> no it wouldn't
[23:25:31] <raj> Cork, is there intention to trick you somehow?
[23:25:38] <Cork> unless you send the wrong mimetype
[23:25:48] <raj> cuz I see no reason for there to be .png written there
[23:25:49] <dblosevn> thats what i just said lol
[23:26:00] <Cork> raj: wouldn't supprice me if they use apng for users that support it
[23:26:16] <Cork> and send gif if the ua doesn't support apng
[23:26:36] <raj> which browsers support apng?
[23:26:47] <Cork> opera (none webkit) and geckoo
[23:26:55] <Cork> or rather presto and geckoo
[23:27:03] <Cork> opps *gecko
[23:29:31] <raj> damn, you shoulda pastebinned that list
[23:29:48] <Cork> pastebinned what list?
[23:29:55] <raj> of supported browsers
[23:30:05] <raj> *supporting
[23:30:05] <Cork> its just one gecko
[23:30:14] <Cork> preso is deprecated
[23:30:31] <raj> >_< sarcasm :)
[23:30:39] <Cork> ah :)
[23:31:12] <Cork> gecko liked to hack png instead of using mng
[23:31:17] <Cork> so they invented apng
[23:31:36] <Cork> they even removed mng in favor or using apng
[23:31:37] <Cork> :/
[23:31:48] <Cork> i really hate mozilla for that
[23:36:14] <milligan> http://pastebin.com/VDWq25Zr <- That is not sufficient to keep the active tab persistent, i.e on a page refresh? (If it is, any idea why it's not working? :P)
[23:38:54] <Cork> milligan: there is no cookie attribute on the tab module
[23:39:09] <Cork> s/attribute/option/
[23:39:59] <milligan> This claims so, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4248587/jquery-ui-tabs-cookie-persistance-with-multiple-tabs . Post is from 2010 though. Has the option been removed, and if so, did they not replace it with something ?
[23:41:09] <Cork> milligan: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tabs.js
[23:41:27] <Cork> find: cookie | Phrase not found
[23:54:50] <pats_Toms> is there someone who is using jam?
[23:55:08] <pats_Toms> I have some problems with jquery, it's not defined in random packages
[23:55:12] <pats_Toms> like antiscroll for example
[23:55:30] <pats_Toms> someone have any ideas?
[23:55:38] <milligan> Cork, is "select" not an option either ?
[23:56:08] <Cork> milligan: not in newer jquery-ui versions
[23:56:29] <Cork> was removed in 1.10 if i remember correctly
[23:57:04] <milligan> dang
