[00:01:51] <dxgriffiths> Lunders: I'm afraid to look in case it crashes my browser!
[00:01:57] <dxgriffiths> But I'll look.
[00:02:28] <Lunders> it wont :) it just goes nuts ..
[00:02:40] <dxgriffiths> Hmm, works ok here.
[00:03:00] <motaka2> http://pastebin.com/4ynqsaLN   I am trying to find a way that whenever I click on a row i can call a function that I can send data.persons[count] as an argument to it, is there any way ?
[00:03:04] <Lunders> :) yeah iv fixed it lol
[00:03:57] <Lunders> dxgriffiths: how could I do something like .... if turns_left === 0 and end_date === "today" hide package
[00:04:07] <Edler> motaka2: jsfiddle.net
[00:04:24] <motaka2> Edler: What are you talking about ?
[00:04:47] <eml> motaka2: paste code @ jsfiddle.net
[00:04:59] <eml> motaka2: You can include jquery there, specify some html and stuff. Better than pastebin
[00:05:06] <motaka2> eml: whats the difference
[00:05:12] <eml> motaka2: Have a look.
[00:05:19] <motaka2> eml: ok
[00:05:47] <dxgriffiths> Lunders: that's a complex question :)
[00:06:39] <Lunders> its ok :) might do it in a PHP if statement
[00:07:23] <motaka2> eml: http://jsfiddle.net/ferPM/
[00:07:47] <Edler> motaka2: where's the html ?
[00:07:58] <Edler> you're posting to localhost...
[00:08:11] <motaka2> Edler: I dont have the proj online
[00:08:21] <Edler> what are you trying to do ?
[00:09:06] <motaka2> Edler: in here http://pastebin.com/4ynqsaLN check line 46 where i make a new <tr>
[00:09:48] <Edler> what's the problem ?
[00:09:52] <motaka2> Edler: I want when the user clicks on a row a function is called so I can send the data.persons[count] as input argument
[00:10:13] <motaka2> Edler: Is that possible?
[00:10:28] <Edler> you're talking javascript wise ?
[00:10:52] <motaka2> Edler: I dont understand you , my english is not perfect
[00:10:59] <Edler> i know you're arabic
[00:10:59] <Edler> but
[00:11:07] <Edler> what do you mean send as input argument ?
[00:11:15] <motaka2> Edler: I am persian , we dont like arabs at all
[00:11:24] <Edler> ow okay
[00:11:29] <Edler> just figured from the writings
[00:11:32] <Edler> anyway
[00:11:41] <Edler> what do you mean send as input argument ?
[00:12:01] <Edler> send where ?
[00:12:02] <motaka2> Edler:  somthing like <tr onclick="foo(data.persons[count])">
[00:12:18] <Edler> well yes why can't you do that
[00:12:20] <Edler> first of all
[00:12:28] <Edler> bind a function to the click event of the tr
[00:12:41] <Edler> $("tr...").click(function(){...});
[00:12:53] <Edler> so that when the tr is clicked the function is called
[00:12:54] <dacosta_de11> Hello! I want to create the following: In two Input Fields I want the user to write customer numbers. Via jquery I then want to show customers data. So I created a class for the business. I create in this class a init routine to associate on input field blur a command to the class. Now my problem is: I initialize class to customer1 and customer2. But customer1 thinks he is customer2 and...
[00:12:56] <dacosta_de11> ...outputs the data to customer2. Here is the code: http://dpaste.com/546253/
[00:13:11] <Edler> that function will call foo and pass data.persons[count]
[00:13:42] <motaka2> Edler: lemme see
[00:16:00] <Edler> dacosta_de11: you should put those calls into a closure
[00:16:35] <Edler> instead of: relative.main(customerId);
[00:16:36] <Edler> put
[00:16:54] <Edler> (function(customerId){relative.main(customerId);})(relative.main(customerId);)
[00:16:56] <Edler> i mean
[00:17:00] <Edler> (function(customerId){relative.main(customerId);})(relative.main(customerId))
[00:17:12] <Edler> errr i mean
[00:17:16] <Edler> (function(customerId){relative.main(customerId);})(customerId)
[00:18:03] <motaka2> Edler: nope , I have changed the code , but it says data is not defined , here is the changed code :  http://pastebin.com/ALw3Tfm6
[00:18:24] <dacosta_de11> Edler and this function should not be in the class?
[00:19:00] <Edler> well you haven't stored in anywhere
[00:19:07] <Edler> (outside of that function)
[00:19:20] <Edler> try this
[00:19:28] <Edler> in the first line of your js file
[00:19:29] <Edler> do this:
[00:19:34] <Edler> var global_data;
[00:19:49] <Edler> and in the first line of the success function put: global_data = data
[00:19:57] <Edler> then use global_data anywhere you want in your script

[00:51:45] <djcoin> Hey guyz, i have a question, I was wondering if JQuery had some way to interfere when some element in the page are inserted or deleted, does it triggers once again the JQuery(document).ready function once again for example
[00:52:00] <NetRoY> Trisox: http://jsfiddle.net/netroy/fAwQC/2/
[00:53:40] <NetRoY> djcoin: nop... although u can override native functions & wrap them
[00:53:50] <motaka2> in  this code it says data.persons[count] is undefined , http://pastebin.com/FPWNwfr2   why is that ?
[00:54:42] <djcoin> NetRoY: not sure what you mean
[00:57:32] <NetRoY> djcoin: wait.. i'll write something on jsfiddle
[01:00:17] <EM03> so I give in no more prototpejs.....damn popular jquery it is
[01:02:03] <NetRoY> djcoin: http://jsfiddle.net/netroy/pRPt3/2/
[01:03:33] <NetRoY> djcoin: so u can override the native methods by wrappers that can intercept the calls ... :)

[01:07:44] <djcoin> NetRoY: Sorry did not see you answer me. Thanks ! Indeed thats a great idea
[01:08:05] <djcoin> Do you think, though its ok, to tweak such "low" behaviour ?

[01:08:42] <__name__> Can jQuery do Array and Object comparisons by value?
[01:08:43] <folo> Bot the eventType is the id or the class

[01:09:03] <folo> what id = handler?
[01:09:06] <dr0id> it's the event!

[01:13:59] <folo> hi
[01:16:06] <folo>  $(".comment").bind('click', function(){ $(".commentForm").slideToggle(); return false;
[01:16:20] <folo> in that line i am clicking in the class .comment
[01:16:29] <folo> but there are many events of that class
[01:16:45] <folo> so when I click it will toggle all the events
[01:16:57] <folo> I tried to create a counter
[01:17:12] <folo> so it can create a different class everytime
[01:17:22] <Cork> folo: i guess you want to replace .comentForm with a $(this).find
[01:17:26] <folo> like comment_1
[01:17:29] <folo> so forth
[01:17:33] <Cork> else it will do slideToggle for all .commentForms in the page
[01:17:49] <folo> yes
[01:17:52] <Deele> folo, it will trigger all events you have bind previously
[01:17:56] <folo> so I don't have to create a counter
[01:17:57] <folo> for that ?
[01:18:09] <folo> yes I just want to trigger the one clicked
[01:18:09] <Cork> folo: as i said => $(this).find(".commentForm")
[01:19:45] <sshaginyan> How would I customize jquery-ui autocomplete html generation?
[01:20:06] <sshaginyan> The auto complete uses a table
[01:20:51] <folo> cork like in here ?
[01:20:52] <folo> http://jsfiddle.net/GWkfG/4/
[01:21:24] <folo> is that right Cork
[01:22:00] <folo> that didn't work
[01:22:53] <Cork> folo: (".comment") should be $(".comment")
[01:22:53] <Cork> the rest looks fine
[01:23:37] <folo> let me check that
[01:23:50] <Cork> folo: oh, wait
[01:23:55] <folo> aja
[01:23:59] <Cork> you have the commentform following the comment
[01:24:31] <Cork> so you need $(this).nextAll(".commentForm").slideToggle();
[01:24:32] <folo> yes
[01:24:42] <folo> i have the comment first
[01:24:44] <Cork> uh... no
[01:24:49] <Cork> so you need $(this).nextAll(".commentForm:first").slideToggle();
[01:24:57] <folo> ok that looks great
[01:24:59] <folo> let me check that
[01:25:49] <folo> Shit sweet
[01:25:53] <folo> it made it
[01:25:59] <folo> what is the nextAll ?
[01:26:25] <Cork> ?.nextAll @ folo
[01:26:26] <bot-t> folo, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[01:26:47] <folo> i am reading now
[01:26:51] <Cork> folo: if your sure that commentForm always follow direct after the comment
[01:27:01] <Cork> you can use next() instead, and that should be faster too
[01:27:17] <Cork> but if you add anything inbetween it will break if you do
[01:27:35] <rethus> is there a easy way to get the contrary of if(askVcard=="on" || askLogo=="on" || askLetter="on")
[01:27:42] <rethus> means one of them must be "on"
[01:28:27] <adam_> hi there
[01:28:49] <Cork> rethus: $.inArray('on', [askVcard, askLogo, askLetter]) > -1
[01:28:53] <folo> comment is the class of a span tag that styles the word comment
[01:29:04] <adam_> before i report this as a bug - can someone please let me whether this is expected behavior?
[01:29:11] <folo> when click on the word comment then it will trigger the class commentForm
[01:29:12] <adam_> $.extend(true, {}, {a:[1,2]}, {a:[2]}).a // => [2,2]
[01:29:18] <folo> which actually containts the form
[01:29:22] <folo> <form>
[01:29:28] <folo> so comment always goes first
[01:29:31] <folo> then commentForm
[01:29:51] <rethus> i wonder why there are nothing in all the languages thats work like this if( nooneOf(foo,bar,foba) )
[01:29:54] <Cork> adam_: yes it is
[01:29:58] <folo> what do you mean if I add anything in beteen cork ?
[01:30:13] <jrockjiggz> commentForm and comment are two different class names, .comment will not trigger commentForm
[01:30:16] <praveen> can someone tell me any great feture in other javascript library that jquery doesn't have
[01:30:20] <praveen> ?
[01:30:23] <praveen> please
[01:30:23] <Cork> adam_: [1,2] + [2] === {0:1, 1:2} + {0: 2}
[01:30:24] <praveen> ..
[01:30:28] <davejuk> Can anyone tell me why my ajax call errors when i pass it this string as the data parameter: layerid=3&latlng=51.387208929203744,-3.2739259804686753&savename=TestTitle&savecontent=%3Cp%3ETestContent%3C%2Fp%3E
[01:30:35] <davejuk> If savecontent is blank then it works fine
[01:30:36] <adam_> Cork: how is that expected? it seems like the resulting array should either be overwritten completely and be jus t[2]
[01:30:53] <adam_> Cork: or that it should be merged and be [1,2] or [1,2,2]
[01:30:54] <Cork> adam_: cause your douing a deep merge
[01:31:13] <Cork> adam_: cause [2] has the key 0, not 3
[01:31:19] <Cork> *2
[01:31:39] <adam_> Cork: ah, so it takes array indices as keys
[01:31:47] <adam_> Cork: makes sense, thanks
[01:31:54] <Cork> adam_: arrays is just glorified objects :)
[01:31:54] <folo> I got you Cork
[01:32:03] <folo> the manual expained it
[01:32:07] <adam_> Cork: i get it now, thanks :)
[01:32:14] <Cork> np
[01:32:32] <folo> the comment is the only one and it is a class not a tag
[01:32:42] <folo> so it will always be interpreted as first
[01:32:52] <Cork> O_o'
[01:32:53] <Cork> no
[01:33:09] <Cork> the :first means grab the first element in the list
[01:33:25] <Cork> the dot infront of commentForm makes it a class, not the :first
[01:33:59] <Cork> folo: $(this) is a reference to the .comment clicked on
[01:34:13] <folo> ok to specify
[01:34:15] <Cork> folo: nextAll() finds all siblings following it
[01:34:21] <folo> ok
[01:34:34] <Cork> folo: the ".commentForm" filters it to just elements with that class
[01:34:39] <folo> after the first encounter with .comment class right ?
[01:34:40] <Cork> and :first grabs the first of them
[01:34:51] <folo> yes
[01:35:07] <folo> there is not variants
[01:35:09] <folo> in here
[01:35:21] <folo> so i won't have a trouble specifying which one is first
[01:35:38] <folo> i mean it will come from the first event of .comment
[01:35:46] <folo> good
[01:35:49] <folo> man great
[01:36:14] <folo> i have to go back to php now
[01:36:39] <folo> and jam that subcomment inside the comment
[01:36:41] <folo> uffffffffffffffffffff
[01:37:06] <folo> right now it is displaying in the comment field instead of nicely below as a subcategory of the comment
[01:37:54] <folo> how can I join another channel from here?
[01:38:06] <Cork> /join <channel>
[01:38:08] <folo> don;t remember the coordenates
[01:38:09] <folo> ok
[01:38:15] <folo> do you know of a good php channel
[01:38:22] <folo> or better say the most populated one
[01:38:25] <Cork> no, i don't
[01:38:32] <Cork> but i know of one, and only one
[01:38:36] <Cork> #php
[01:38:38] <folo> yes
[01:38:39] <folo> lol
[01:39:15] <folo> it doesn't get me there
[01:39:25] <folo> i put /join #php
[01:39:29] <folo> doesn't get me there
[01:39:34] <folo> it just go empty
[01:39:37] <folo> maybe is full
[01:39:39] <iivvoo> ##php?
[01:39:49] <folo> let me see
[01:39:51] <iivvoo> never really understood waht the double hash-stuff means on freenode
[01:39:51] <Cork> ah your using some form of cgi webchat
[01:40:03] <folo> no it didn't do it
[01:40:12] <folo> livvno
[01:40:19] <Cork> folo: i guess the client doesn't support it
[01:40:25] <Cork> joining channels that is
[01:40:39] <folo> hwo can I access to the list of hcannles ?
[01:40:56] <folo> --- /list channels
[01:40:57] <folo> ?
[01:42:40] <Cork> folo: that would be in a normal, no clue about the thing your using
[01:43:12] <folo> yes it worked
[01:43:16] <folo> it listed all the channels
[01:46:15] <toxz> is it possible to create dynamic object vars? something like - {'_ajax[requestParams][' + requestParamsIndex + ']': requestParamsValue}   ?
[01:47:42] <Cork> toxz: no inline in the objet creation
[01:48:03] <Cork> you have to do var obj = {}; obj[key] = value;
[01:48:30] <toxz> Cork - thx - ill try that
[01:48:31] <Cork> no==not
[01:49:09] <Cork> toxz: a small wrapper function and a loop can make it really neet ;)
[01:55:10] <folo> Cork
[01:55:36] <Cork> ?
[01:55:39] <folo> the form commentForm in order for me to ajax as in the blab form
[01:55:53] <Cork> what?
[01:55:54] <folo> i have to create anew events for that form
[01:55:56] <folo> as well?
[01:56:11] <Cork> no, you just need to select it
[01:56:25] <Cork> folo: i think you should start with a jquery tutorial
[01:56:35] <Cork> about how selectors works to be presize
[01:56:38] <folo> so i just have to add it
[01:56:42] <folo> add
[01:56:42] <folo> ok
[01:56:55] <folo> let me see that
[01:57:06] <Cork> ?g jquery get started
[01:57:07] <bot-t> Cork, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[01:57:20] <AdvoWork> how would i add a click event to a <a href?  ive got <div id="nav"><a id="test">test</a></div>  then $("a.test").click(add_new_sort);  that does nothing' no errors,
[01:58:00] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: . is for classes. # is for ids.
[01:58:29] <Cork> AdvoWork: and you don't need the a, ids are uniq on the page
[01:58:43] <Cork> so $('#test') is enough
[01:59:30] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, ahh thanks!!
[02:00:46] <folo> in other words I can have as many selectors I a need in inside like here http://jsfiddle.net/GWkfG/5/
[02:02:14] <Cork> folo: basically yes, even though there are different ways to perform the same task
[02:02:24] <folo> ok
[02:02:24] <Cork> and som might be faster then other
[02:02:33] <folo> ok
[02:04:12] <AdvoWork> whats ther best way to check if an id exists on a page? if ($(idofelement).length )  ?
[02:04:56] <Cork> AdvoWork: ya .length > 0
[02:07:10] <rethus> $("#askLogo").attr('checked') only ask if it is checked? how can i check it?
[02:09:27] <hrwath> rethus, $("#askLogo:checked").length
[02:10:00] <rethus> i have found this: $('#checkProduct').attr('checked', true);
[02:10:07] <rethus> is this right, to check the checkbox
[02:10:31] <Cork> rethus: $("#askLogo").attr('checked', 'checked')
[02:10:37] <Cork> but ya, true works too
[02:13:45] <folo> Cork
[02:13:54] <folo> you remember about the commentForm:first
[02:14:21] <folo> it has some type of trouble when I frist click it will refresh the page
[02:14:28] <folo> and then after that it will ajax the
[02:14:31] <folo> why is that ?
[02:14:47] <folo> is there a wway to ajax the very first time
[02:14:50] <folo> no t eh second itme
[02:15:04] <Cork> folo: its not that, its prob taht your hitting on of the links you have in your comment block
[02:15:44] <folo> really
[02:15:48] <folo> let me see
[02:17:02] <folo> well now it is working when I hit right on the link
[02:17:11] <folo> how can I avoid that
[02:17:14] <folo> from happening
[02:17:39] <Cork> folo: you would have to bind all links in the comment and trigger event.preventDefault(); in them
[02:18:33] <folo> comment class?
[02:18:37] <seutje> or bind on the wrapper and check the target
[02:18:53] <folo> bind the wrapper of the class comment?
[02:19:14] <Cork> seutje: that won't help, as the event bubble, the default action will trigger before the click event
[02:19:47] <Cork> click > click_event > click_acton > parent_click_event
[02:20:30] <folo> the parent click event would be the wrapper or the class comment?
[02:20:39] <folo> i think the comment class doesn't have a wrapper
[02:20:40] <Cork> folo: another cleaner solution would be to not use a links at all in the comments
[02:20:49] <folo> or an immidiated parent
[02:21:16] <folo> and how can I trigger the event of gettting the form to toggle
[02:21:17] <Cork> as you want to kill them anyway, theres no need for them
[02:21:24] <folo> i need a point from where to toggle cork
[02:21:34] <ProLoser|Trmnl> thanks ajpiano
[02:21:45] <folo> http://jsfiddle.net/GWkfG/5/
[02:21:53] <folo> the comment text
[02:21:54] <ProLoser|Trmnl> heh, after reading that i decided to test my grit by building the js fn he mentions
[02:22:02] <folo> will trigger the toggle of the form
[02:22:11] <folo> if I take the comment text
[02:22:12] <folo> then
[02:22:25] <folo> i won';t have an anchor from where to trigger
[02:22:31] <Cork> folo: i think you need to start with reading a jquery tuorial
[02:22:33] <folo> i want that slidetoggle effect
[02:22:40] <Cork> folo: you need to grasp the basics first
[02:22:57] <folo> ok
[02:23:29] <seutje> Cork: hmm, good point
[02:24:21] <Trisox> happy towel day !!!!!!!!!!
[02:24:32] <coldhead> you too, Trisox
[02:25:10] <Trisox> thnx!

[02:48:11] <_ramo> hi
[02:49:07] <_ramo> is there any other event, that triggers, if a user is closing the browser with x ? i try jQuery(window).unload(function() { alert ("end")}); but i saw no alert
[02:50:39] <jonee> hi http://pastebin.com/CWNuGqSw
[02:50:48] <jonee> care to tell me anything wrong with that code
[02:51:06] <jonee> i mean would anyone help me find out what's wrong with the code
[02:51:59] <mavv> hi. please look at this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/RtF2e/ is it possible, to attach event to #something to capture moment, when it's parent (tab) is hidden or not automatically?
[02:55:35] <daxim_> when I use jslint on the line:   jq-expression.each(function (i, elem) { …    it complains about "Unused variable: i".  that's true, I only use "elem"; "i" is a dummy needed because "each" uses positional parameters.
[02:55:36] <daxim_> replacing i with null says:   "Expected an identifier and instead saw 'null' (a reserved word)."   what's the recommended way to deal with this situation?
[03:05:49] <sudaya> hi all, how to override inline css using jquery ??
[03:06:46] <shomon> hi, I'm so rubbish at jquery. I can never get it working. There must be some huge gotcha... I have put all the corresponding css and js in the <head> bit of a page. And I copied letter for letter the tooltip stuff from http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/ but it's not showing
[03:06:49] <shomon> how do I debug?
[03:09:44] <mavv> shomon you should use a firebug - firefox extension.
[03:09:56] <shomon> well, I'm in webdeveloper on firefox
[03:10:03] <shomon> or on google's firebug type thing
[03:10:44] <shomon> I even just cut and pasted everything in that demo header, took out my own header, and c/p'd their code to my page. But nothing
[03:10:48] <shomon> I must have a js curse
[03:12:04] <shomon> by google firebug type thing I mean google chrome's developer tools
[03:13:01] <shomon> I don't know where I should be looking. Basically to get jquery to run, you add the jquery library, the jquery min library, the css for the plugin you want, and the full and mini js for that plugin?
[03:13:55] <shomon> and then you just add a corresponding id for the jquery affected css to the html code of the page?
[03:14:05] <djcoin> Does anyone know how I could retrieve the html reprensentation of a DOM node ? I tried .html() but it gets me the content of the element
[03:14:12] <djcoin> i want the element and its content
[03:14:15] <djcoin> be returned
[03:14:19] <djcoin> Thanks a lot
[03:14:34] <Aamir> ?get @djcoin
[03:14:46] <Aamir> djcoin:  google for jquery .get()
[03:15:21] <Aamir> html reprensentation of a DOM node??? not sure :|
[03:16:03] <Aamir> ?101
[03:16:57] <djcoin> Aamir: but get will return the dom node no ?
[03:17:07] <djcoin> not an html string
[03:17:22] <Aamir> djcoin:  what u want, example?
[03:18:30] <djcoin> Aamir: what I want to do is to copy not an element itself
[03:18:35] <djcoin> but its html representation
[03:18:46] <djcoin> as html() return it
[03:18:55] <djcoin> but the fact is that it return its content
[03:18:58] <djcoin> and not himself
[03:19:01] <djcoin> with its content
[03:19:25] <Aamir> djcoin:  urelement.clone() ?
[03:19:26] <strycore> Hi !
[03:19:38] <Aamir> strycore: Hello
[03:19:41] <denysonique> how do I determine the exact scroll position if I want to ScrollLeft() to the end of the document?
[03:20:29] <timing> just scroll to 0?
[03:20:32] <denysonique> when I scrollLeft  to the $(window).width() there is still 10px left
[03:20:38] <denysonique> timing: end not beginning
[03:20:39] <timing> outerWidth()
[03:20:48] <shomon> does anyone know ways to troubleshoot jquery and find out where a problem is?
[03:20:52] <timing> there might be a padding/margin somewhere
[03:20:54] <shomon> or js in the first place
[03:21:15] <Aamir> shomon: firebug breakpoints
[03:21:48] <Aamir> shomon:  http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[03:22:10] <strycore> so I have this focusout function that adds a class on a condition and then counts the number of elements with that class, but it never counts the element that was just added
[03:22:20] <shomon> thanks very much Aamir  I'm finding out how to get firebug.
[03:22:29] <SpecialEmily> is jsfiddler broken?

[03:31:58] <SpecialEmily> how do I submit a form from jquery?
[03:32:02] <SpecialEmily> is it just like .submit() ?
[03:32:13] <Aamir> SpecialEmily:  yes
[03:32:18] <SpecialEmily> awesome
[03:32:27] <Aamir> SpecialEmily:  yourform.submit(function(e){ ...})
[03:33:32] <Aamir> SpecialEmily:  make sure you prevent the event in the function otherwise your page will navigate to form's action
[03:34:54] <mavv> please look at this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/RtF2e/ is it possible, to attach event to #something to capture moment, when it's parent (tab) is hidden or not automatically?
[03:38:09] <SpecialEmily> Aamir, I don't understand :s
[03:39:02] <shomon> Aamir, I am at http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide8 but I think the problem I am having is no errors are showing up on the console...
[03:39:17] <shomon> on the page I'm trying to fix that is
[03:39:18] <Aamir> yourform.submit(function(e){  e.preventDefault()  })
[03:39:24] <Trudko> guys I am using JQuerry tree table and I have problem. look here    http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/801/unleddm.jpg/   I have node with id 1562347 which as you can see is parent of 1562348 and also child 1562347. Problem is that I dont want expand / collapse button next to it  if its does not have childs.
[03:40:07] <Aamir> shomon:  its good if you dont have any errors
[03:40:10] <Aamir> :)
[03:40:14] <shomon> that would be good
[03:40:19] <shomon> but the error is that no jquery works
[03:40:28] <SpecialEmily> Aamir, but...what if I want the default? :s
[03:40:47] <shomon> any jquery I put in as an ID or class referred to in js or css as jquery, won't do what it needs to
[03:40:52] <Aamir> SpecialEmily:  the page will submit i.e. reload
[03:40:56] <shomon> in this case, getting a "title" attribute to show a tooltip
[03:41:02] <_ramo> is there any other event, that triggers, if a user is closing the browser with x ? i try jQuery(window).unload(function() { alert ("end")}); but i saw no alert
[03:41:17] <SpecialEmily> Aamir, yea. I want that
[03:41:41] <Aamir> SpecialEmily:  ok than ur fine :)
[03:41:42] <shomon> an error would be good
[03:41:58] <Aamir> shomon:  urelement.attr('title')
[03:42:30] <Aamir> _ramo:  jsbin.com ur example
[03:43:03] <coconutz> kinda off topic but please help, no one in facebook is alive... anyone has idea what is the  $auth_nonce = "YOUR_AUTH_NONCE"; on the facebook developer auth page?

[03:43:53] <Aamir> try closing it
[03:44:17] <shomon> where do I put that aamir? I have copied this from the tooltip demo: $(function() { $('#set1 *').tooltip();
[03:44:18] <shomon> }); and then added id="set" to an a href link
[03:44:29] <_ramo> Aamir: what have you done?
[03:44:29] <Aamir> coconutz:  ask on #facebook
[03:44:37] <coconutz> they are dead there ;)
[03:44:41] <Aamir> _ramo:  example
[03:44:52] <_ramo> Aamir: my example?
[03:44:55] <shomon> good to hear that facebook is dead :)
[03:45:38] <Aamir> shomon:  no body can help unless u make a demo on jsfiddle.net (if its dead than try jsbin.com )

[03:48:41] <shaggy_> Does anyone know why this: http://pastebin.com/MGSggM7j only works for the first entry? How can I make it work for all of them (in any order)
[03:49:43] <_ramo> Aamir: your example: http://jsbin.com/eruru4 is not working...
[03:49:53] <shomon> http://jsbin.com/upoka5
[03:49:57] <shomon> thanks Aamir
[03:50:05] <_ramo> Aamir: don't close the tab, close a whole browser
[03:50:16] <shomon> I don't know what to put in the javasscript box. it's all referred from the script src links
[03:50:22] <AdvoWork> am i right in thinking $.post('ajax/test.html', function(data) {$('.result').html(data);});   means send the information within "data" to the html page, and on success update the result element with that data, or if not, where does it get the post data?
[03:50:54] <Aamir> shomon:  still working http://gyazo.com/a165b4cde02005d9826060ee5fe94486.png
[03:51:22] <shomon> still working?
[03:51:25] <_ramo> Aamir: than it's not working in firefox
[03:51:27] <_ramo> he ment me
[03:51:34] <shomon> aah okay :)
[03:51:52] <_ramo> Aamir: in FF 4.0.1 it's not working.. in chrom it is working
[03:52:19] <silverdiamond_> hey guys, just working with the jq ui autocomplete, I have setup my script to out a 'no results found' result, but I am having a trouble adding on a 'View More Results' option when multiple options are returned.  Would someone be kind enough to have a look and offer their advice please: http://pastebin.com/bL5W4TKm
[03:52:26] <_ramo> in IE 9 it's working too
[03:53:25] <shomon> Aamir, any idea why it's not working? thanks
[03:53:55] <L4suicide> if I have somevar = thisobj.find('div'), and then somevar.each( function { $(this).addClass(x)}), how would I update thisobj with the class change?
[03:54:24] <shomon> I've directly used the jquery files from the demo example. temporarily..
[03:57:25] <shomon> does anyone know what is causing the tooltip not to show in this page?  http://jsbin.com/upoka5/5
[03:58:03] <GuidoBouman> Guys, I got a teeny tiny problem
[03:58:08] <GuidoBouman> http://daniel.aikone.com/
[03:58:08] <Aamir> _ramo:  try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1244535/alert-when-browser-window-closed-accidentally
[03:58:18] <GuidoBouman> The slider isn't sliding.
[03:58:20] <GuidoBouman> ...
[03:58:27] <GuidoBouman> It's switching, but not sliding.
[03:59:10] <Aamir> shomon:  http://jsbin.com/upoka5/7/
[03:59:51] <_ramo> Aamir: i'll try it, thank you
[04:00:03] <Aamir> GuidoBouman:  not sure but try with different images not a single image
[04:00:11] <GuidoBouman> Yep, doing it now.
[04:01:12] <shomon> Aamir doesn't work. I see the same regular tooltip as before
[04:01:44] <Aamir> shomon:  whats the problem
[04:01:48] <Aamir> its working?
[04:02:11] <AdvoWork> i need a pointer im afraid, trying to create an array; ive got: data = {'new_customers_reference:' , $('#new_customers_reference').val(), 'new_width:' , $('#new_width').val() };    i know this is way off, any tips?
[04:02:18] <shomon> it should show a tooltip like in http://jquery.bassistance.de/tooltip/demo/
[04:02:37] <shomon> instead it shows a typical yellow html  tooltip
[04:02:48] <shomon> or title element...
[04:03:13] <Aamir> shomon: than include the css file the site is using
[04:03:48] <DarsVaeda> hi, I have to <div id="1">...<button></button></div> and <div id="2">...<button></button></div>; when the button is clicked I fetch the parent of that button and get the id, the div itself is actually a jquery-ui dialog, if I open a dialog it works, gets the correct id back, but if I first open one dialog and hit the button (correct id is returned) and then open the second dialog the first id is returned as parent.id?!?
[04:07:16] <DarsVaeda> now after a reload it works without changing the code...this gets me crazy
[04:07:18] <shomon> Aamir, It's included. No jquery there yet. http://jsbin.com/upoka5/12/edit
[04:07:24] <shomon> I've tried in chrome and ff
[04:07:24] <Aamir> shomon:  make sure u include the js and css files properly http://jsbin.com/upoka5/13/
[04:07:41] <shomon> aah wow! thanks
[04:08:09] <Aamir> shomon:  i like http://craigsworks.com/projects/simpletip/
[04:10:39] <shomon> so on that page, the site's existing jquery was conflicting with the jquery needed to get the tooltip working.
[04:10:57] <BlaDe^> can I strip a <hr> from an element? i.e. $(...).find('a').attr('href').show(); is what I have
[04:11:03] <sodapop> can i somehow remove the change function of the accordion widget after is executed once ?
[04:11:07] <BlaDe^> can I add .find('hr').remove().show() or similar
[04:11:08] <Trudko> by anychange some using jquerty plugin treeTable? I havent been lucky on Jquery channel
[04:11:14] <Trudko> guys I am using JQuerry tree table and I have problem. look here    http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/801/unleddm.jpg/   I have node with id 1562347 which as you can see is parent of 1562348 and also child 1562347. Problem is that I dont want expand / collapse button next to it  if its does not have childs.
[04:12:05] <shomon> does that jquery already contain some function to allow for tooltips? Maybe I can do it somehow without adding plugins or new stuff
[04:12:09] <shomon> jquery-1.4.4.min.js I mean
[04:19:32] <AdvoWork> how do i add an item to an array? so its like thename  with value "test" ?
[04:23:31] <khurram> hi all
[04:23:49] <khurram> can i change the background-image of a div using jquery  ?
[04:24:01] <Cork> sure
[04:24:04] <Cork> ?.css
[04:24:04] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[04:24:47] <GuidoBouman> http://daniel.aikone.com/
[04:24:50] <khurram> var src = "image.php?new="+randomnumber;           var bg = "url("+src+")";       $("#cssDiv").attr("background-image",bg);
[04:24:53] <GuidoBouman> The slider is not sliding...
[04:25:10] <GuidoBouman> It's the Slides plugin (http://slidesjs.com/)
[04:25:56] <khurram> is it permissible in jquery ?
[04:26:32] <Trudko> guys if I have multiple same ids and jquery size() returns one, why<
[04:26:48] <Cork> khurram: its just css, sure it is
[04:26:57] <khurram> Trudko: id should be unique use class instead of id
[04:27:11] <Cork> Trudko: cause idn can't exist more then once in a page
[04:27:13] <khurram> Cork: why it is not chaning the background-image then ?
[04:27:22] <Cork> Trudko: tehy are uniq by design
[04:27:47] <Trudko> Khurram Cork yeah I know that, so thats because it return 1
[04:27:48] <Cork> khurram: your setting it from an ajax call?
[04:27:55] <khurram> yes
[04:28:04] <Cork> Trudko: thats why it returns 1 ya
[04:28:21] <Cork> Trudko: you would have to select by [id="<your id"]
[04:28:26] <Cork> * [id="<your id>"]
[04:28:29] <khurram> Cork: yes i am using ajax function to
[04:28:53] <khurram> Cork: please have a look here http://jsfiddle.net/B6yLm/
[04:28:55] <Cork> khurram: whats the generated html?
[04:29:33] <Trudko> ok will do that what I need to do is reindex all of ids  so lets say I have id=5 twice and I want change it to 5#1 and 5#2
[04:30:27] <Cork> Trudko: you shouldn't have # in your idn
[04:30:30] <khurram> Cork: console.log returns this -> bg = url('image.php?new=894')
[04:30:32] <Cork> that won't work in css
[04:30:41] <khurram> :(
[04:31:05] <L4suicide> oh my god im going insane.. $(targetbody).find('img[src*="cards"]').each(function() { $(this).addClass('cards') }); <---------- should this not add the class within targetbody?
[04:31:08] <Cork> khurram: uh.. did you check what command i told you to use?
[04:31:13] <Cork> css... not .attr
[04:31:30] <khurram> yep i did it and its working.
[04:31:32] <Cork> khurram: .attr will set background-image as an attribute on the element,
[04:31:38] <khurram> Cork: thanks a lot champ
[04:31:40] <Cork> it won't touch the css
[04:33:00] <Trudko> Cork: true what to do except that. To tell you whole problem I am using treetable plugin which creates tree table and in order for it to create parents with node you have to set id for parent and at same time add class for child problem is where you have one node on two places like in my case http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/801/unleddm.jpg/
[04:35:46] <silverdiamond_> hey guys, just working with the jq ui autocomplete, I have setup my script to out a 'no results found' result, but I am having a trouble adding on a 'View More Results' option when multiple options are returned.

[04:36:21] <CVertex> i'm using unobstrusive jquery w/ ruby on rails, and i have a strange problem
[04:37:04] <CVertex> the ajax remote method I'm calling returns text/javascript
[04:37:11] <CVertex> which is automatically run by jQuery
[04:37:44] <CVertex> is there a way to get a hook into the response data processing before the returned script is executed?
[04:37:59] <xec> L4suicide: works when i try it: http://jsfiddle.net/F2xAQ/
[04:38:33] <BlaDe^> is there something like htmlspecialchars_decode in jquery/js ?
[04:39:10] <Trudko> guys I am using JQuerry tree table and I have problem. look here    http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/801/unleddm.jpg/   I have node with id 1562347 which as you can see is parent of 1562348 and also child 1562347. Problem is that I dont want expand / collapse button next to it  if its does not have childs.
[04:39:47] <xec> L4suicide: dont know what you need the .each() for though; http://jsfiddle.net/F2xAQ/1/
[04:40:20] <L4suicide> xec - im trying to run a script which uses .get and .post to get new content, then uses that content to decide what my best move is, and take it (blackjack xD)

[04:42:15] <fmerges> hi
[04:43:25] <Pasti> hulloh, i'm having a little bit trouble with adding some html to the DOM where it's gets added to multiple items while I only want it added to a specific node: http://jsfiddle.net/tpNyb/1/http://jsfiddle.net/tpNyb/1/
[04:44:33] <fmerges> I need to plot a graph that has 350k data points, was thinking that i can make different set of plots so that the user can zoom in, but I was wondering if you know if a plot lib like flot or highcharts could handle it
[04:45:16] <Cork> fmerges: does p.inner exist multible times inside the div?
[04:45:21] <Cork> opps
[04:45:22] <L4suicide> xec - http://jsfiddle.net/L4suicide/RZJey/1/ might explain a little more
[04:45:24] <Cork> sorry wrong nick
[04:45:31] <Cork> Pasti: ^
[04:45:32] <fmerges> Cork: :)
[04:45:49] <Pasti> Cork: depends on which div you are referring to...
[04:45:58] <Pasti> Cork: see the link for markup?
[04:46:08] <GuidoBouman> Guys anyone arround that can help me with a non-sliding slides.js plugin?
[04:46:09] <Cork> div:nth-child(1) <--
[04:46:14] <Cork> ah
[04:46:42] <AdvoWork> im doing an ajax post and this is my code: http://pastebin.com/64bQWhdr  its posting the information to the php file as i can see it, and in the php file i do echo "test" but its not getting into the success bit. any ideas please?
[04:46:57] <Cork> Pasti: you selector isn't presice enough
[04:47:26] <Cork> Pasti: try $('#outer div:first p.inner')
[04:47:40] <Cork> no that won't help...
[04:47:43] <Cork> Pasti: try $('#outer > div:first p.inner')
[04:48:13] <seutje> AdvoWork: is ur response conform with the datatype?
[04:49:24] <xec> L4suicide: what part of that is working and not, and what do you expect to happen? what is targetbody?
[04:49:28] <Pasti> Cork: i tried #outer > div:nth-child as well seemed to do the trick, not sure why.. :)
[04:50:02] <Cork> Pasti: the old one does #outer * div:nth-child p.inner
[04:50:19] <Cork> so it hits the first div on the second lever of ever child div
[04:50:27] <Cork> so it hits them all
[04:51:00] <L4suicide> xec, targetbody is something I set when I use .get to get contents from another page. as I want to process the html on that page using label cards, but I don't always want it beign displayed
[04:51:42] <L4suicide> what is not working is that targetbody doesn't have those classes added outside of the label function
[04:52:46] <BlaDe^> seutje I found: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1147359/jquery-decode-html-entities/2419664#2419664   but clip.setText($("<div/>").html($(link).html()).text()); doesn't work
[04:53:28] <seutje> BlaDe^: why are u telling me?
[04:53:40] <BlaDe^> because you referenced that other function
[04:53:47] <xec> L4suicide:  and labelCards() is called after targetbody is set? and targetbody contains the img tags youre after?
[04:54:08] <AdvoWork> seutje, well, the stuff im echoing in php show as: "customerid":"19224"}<br /> and then loads of other random html
[04:54:11] <Pasti> Cork: ok, thnx a lot :)
[04:54:24] <Cork> np
[04:54:28] <Peeter> Pasti
[04:54:35] <Peeter> use :eq instead of :nth-child
[04:54:37] <Zeddy> does anyone have any idea why my page works fine on firefox, ie, chrome, but completely freezes my computer on safari? http://ewo.fi/
[04:54:40] <seutje> BlaDe^: peculiar reason
[04:55:29] <L4suicide> xec: when i run it the console shows me the urls of the imgs inside the .each, but outside the .each it doesn't, targetbody is not updated by the .each in labelCards
[04:55:50] <seutje> AdvoWork: a simple "no" would have sufficed
[04:55:52] <Zeddy> it works, but everythings happening with a 10 sec delay
[04:57:33] <fmerges> any suggestion for plotting a chart with 350k data points?
[04:57:56] <L4suicide> so yes, targetbody is set before its called, and contains the img tags :(
[04:58:08] <Cork> fmerges: raphael or jqploter is two good ones
[04:58:41] <seutje> <3 raphaël
[04:59:13] <DarsVaeda> hi, why is it that sometimes the ":input" selector does not recognize fields but fills them as empty although the fields are filled with a value?
[04:59:42] <Aamir> ?demo @DarsVaeda
[04:59:47] <Jakey> thats no how it works
[04:59:51] <Jakey> @ DarkHowse
[04:59:52] <L4suicide> hrm, is something else created when i do $(targetbody) - which gets updated, and isn't targetbody itself?
[04:59:56] <Jakey> @ DarsVaeda
[05:00:15] <DarsVaeda> I wish I could put a demo, but its so random that this happens
[05:00:22] <DarsVaeda> how does it work?
[05:00:39] <Jakey> its for selecting not for retrieving values
[05:01:20] <DarsVaeda> *puzzled*
[05:02:13] <xec> L4suicide: im not sure i follow, what do you mean "outside the each"? like the targetbody.find().each( this.src ) works but not targetbody.find().attr("src") does not?
[05:02:42] <Pasti> Peeter: so #outer > div:eq(integerminuseonesinceitszerobased) p.inner ?
[05:03:14] <GuidoBouman> fmerges: Why 350k datapoints? Can you actually make that visible? Try stripping datapoint by calculating averages?
[05:03:20] <DarsVaeda> I do "$(":input").serialize();" ... what does retrieve here?
[05:03:34] <maZtah> is it true that jquery doesn't work on content loaded via ajax?
[05:03:52] <GuidoBouman> maZtah: Wrong
[05:03:56] <xec> maZtah: no, you got something mixed up
[05:03:59] <GuidoBouman> It does work.
[05:04:10] <maZtah> mkay, let me pastebin my code.
[05:04:16] <tumbri800> can anyone do this programme?  Put a simple registration form on dialog box. The registration form should have all validations. If all validations are success then only the dialog box should close. The form elements are your wish. Try to use jquery form plugin for validations.
[05:04:42] <Jakey> DarsVaeda, you need to read up how serialize() serialize your forms
[05:04:50] <xec> maZtah: im gonna take a wild guess this is a .bind() vs .live() sort of thing
[05:04:59] <maZtah> this is my javascript code:
[05:04:59] <maZtah> http://pastebin.com/Nhn4h0PX
[05:05:02] <DarsVaeda> @jakey: okay
[05:05:08] <Jakey> DarsVaeda and i think is has to do with your selector
[05:05:19] <maZtah> where responseText is the whole <form> (including submit button)
[05:05:23] <Jakey> try a simple selector that can select your element
[05:05:35] <xec> maZtah: and what happens
[05:05:39] <Jakey> your form
[05:05:41] <Jakey> i meant
[05:05:54] <maZtah> it works the first time, but when i press the submit button for the second time (after getting it back) it won't alert('b')
[05:05:58] <DarsVaeda> I have no form actually
[05:06:11] <DarsVaeda> just form inputs :)
[05:06:12] <GuidoBouman> tumbri: What do you need it for?
[05:06:37] <DarsVaeda> or form elements it is called
[05:07:32] <tumbri800> Guidobouman: can you please explain how to do this programe.
[05:07:40] <Jakey> DarsVaeda, i think your misusing serialize()
[05:07:50] <Jakey> try wrapping your input a <form>
[05:07:51] <DarsVaeda> not if I read the docu
[05:08:02] <DarsVaeda> "It operates on a jQuery object representing a set of form elements"
[05:08:14] <Jakey> once again
[05:08:14] <GuidoBouman> tumbri: As I asked, what do you need it for?
[05:08:23] <Jakey> wrap your inputs in a <form> tag
[05:08:49] <fmerges> GuidoBouman: right now the user has a QWT Qt app that visualizes each en every point and the user can zoom in to see in detail
[05:09:02] <DarsVaeda> but it works...just not from times to times...sounds like a bug
[05:09:24] <fmerges> GuidoBouman: want to have the same but web based.. I was thinking to make maybe sets of smaller plots so that when you zoom in i load a different image..
[05:09:25] <xec> maZtah: untested, but maybe something like this could work? http://pastebin.com/4e8vV8Ju
[05:09:42] <fmerges> GuidoBouman: because i do realize that they're to many data points..
[05:09:58] <fmerges> GuidoBouman: but was wondering if there are plotting libs that can cope with it
[05:10:05] <tumbri800> guidobouman:actually it's an exercise given to us foPactice
[05:10:24] <L4suicide> xec - i figured it out.. $(targetbody) doesnt update targetbody does it.. if I do targetbody=$(document) can i then do targetbody.find(); on it?
[05:10:26] <tumbri800> guidobouman:actually it's an exercise given to us for Pactice
[05:10:32] <maZtah> xec: then the form gets really submitted (like getting to another page)
[05:10:43] <GuidoBouman> tumbri: I could help you, but not going to do the work for you.
[05:11:07] <GuidoBouman> fmerges: I kinda like Flot. Not sure about it's limit though.
[05:11:19] <GuidoBouman> fmerges: http://code.google.com/p/flot/
[05:11:34] <fmerges> GuidoBouman: flot was my first candidate, second was highcharts
[05:11:35] <xec> maZtah: oh right, hrm.
[05:11:37] <tumbri800> Guidobouman:give any links for that
[05:12:07] <Stavros> hello
[05:12:14] <xec> maZtah: i googled a little and got this, maybe helps? http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1772-jQuery-1-4-Live-Form-Submit-Support.htm
[05:12:25] <Stavros> i'm sending a .post() request to the server, how can i pass a variable to the success function without sending it to the server?
[05:12:47] <GuidoBouman> tumbri: First plugin: http://www.icograma.com/nuestro-trabajo/open-source/jquery-form-validation-and-hints/jquery-form-validation-and-hints-client-side-form-validation.html
[05:15:57] <GuidoBouman> Guys, time for a question form my side:
[05:16:16] <GuidoBouman> I'm using the slides plugin (http://slidesjs.com)
[05:16:36] <tumbri800> Guidobouman: Next ?
[05:16:42] <GuidoBouman> But somehow it's not sliding at all. The plugin is working, and switching slides, but no animations are working.
[05:16:43] <GuidoBouman> http://daniel.aikone.com/contact/
[05:16:58] <tumbri800> Guicobouman:Next?
[05:17:39] <skroot> holy hell, 853 people?
[05:17:48] <xec> L4suicide: i think youre on to something, maybe try selecting what youre trying to manipulate inside your function, rather than use a global variable
[05:17:48] <skroot> and I thought ##php was poppin
[05:17:50] <ravenzz> hello
[05:18:20] <ravenzz> i would fade an image when i change her src
[05:18:35] <GuidoBouman> tumbri: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[05:18:40] <skroot> so heres my question. ive been on a search lately for a very simple image zoon, not like a lightbox zoom or anything, just a simple script i can take a 50x50 image, start with it 1x1 and have it incrementally zoom in until its full size 50x50
[05:18:46] <GuidoBouman> tumbri:  That;s the official validation plugin.
[05:19:01] <ravenzz> any idea?
[05:19:04] <lijzz> tumbri i want to do a opt group enabled cascading dropdown
[05:19:13] <maZtah> xec: why does it gets submitted even when i do e.preventDefault();?
[05:20:08] <GuidoBouman> skroot: if you use $('.myimage').show('slow'); It wil actually fade and zoom the image.
[05:20:40] <xec> maZtah: is the form part of what changes on your site after ajax request?
[05:20:58] <GuidoBouman> maZtah: Try e.stopPropagation();
[05:20:59] <skroot> GuidoBouman, no kidding?
[05:21:03] <skroot> thats incredible
[05:21:08] <GuidoBouman> maZtah:  http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[05:21:20] <maZtah> yeah, the form gets replaced by a new form (exactly the same though)
[05:21:31] <skroot> GuidoBouman, what makes it zoom?
[05:21:36] <GuidoBouman> skroot: Not really fancy though.
[05:21:53] <skroot> i assume the selector can be any element?
[05:21:57] <skroot> or only an image?
[05:22:02] <maZtah> GuidoBouman: doesn't work either
[05:22:28] <GuidoBouman> skroot:  Well, it shows it slowly, which is a combination of a fadeIn, slideDown and slideRight
[05:22:44] <skroot> hrmmm
[05:22:52] <skroot> so it actually zooms in from the top corner?
[05:23:05] <GuidoBouman> Yeah, not really the most fancy thing ever.
[05:23:07] <skroot> GuidoBouman, do you mind if I pm you the link im working with to give a better idea what im looking to accomplish?
[05:23:15] <GuidoBouman> Sure.
[05:26:48] <Stavros> any way i pass a variable to the success function of a .post() without sending it to the server?
[05:27:18] <Cork> Stavros: just put it in a local variable before you make the call
[05:27:21] <xec> maZtah: your .submit() is bound to the original form, and wont apply to future forms (no matter how much alike they are) - did you read the page i sent you?
[05:27:49] <Cork> Stavros: var scope_this = this; $.post(function() { scrope_this.action() });
[05:27:55] <Stavros> Cork: i might be sending a few and i need to tell them apart...
[05:28:11] <Cork> Stavros: so store them in an object then
[05:28:19] <Stavros> Cork: ah, that should work, let me try it
[05:28:21] <ravenzz> $('a.foo').hover(function(){ $('img.foo').attr('src','foo.png'); }, function() { }); how can i add a fadeIn effect?
[05:28:35] <maZtah> yeah i've read that, xec
[05:28:58] <ravenzz> i wouldn't hide it
[05:29:14] <npmap> I've come across some weird behaviour in IE with jQuery. On some profile pages, jQuery fails to select the nodes it should. The exact same HTML works for other profiles.
[05:30:18] <npmap> I've manually debugged this and I can tell it was the top-level select, the one where all of the other html was supposed to be added. Is there some known issue jQuery 1.4.4 and selecting in IE6/7/8/9?
[05:30:39] <maZtah> xec: but my form still gets submitted..
[05:33:26] <ravenzz> ...
[05:34:37] <AdvoWork> im doing an ajax post and this is my code: http://pastebin.com/SFKdYTD5 its posting the information to the php file as i can see it, and in the php file is doing the echoing the json_encode yet its not getting to success. any ideas please? I see loads the echo'd data in the response(firebug) but loads of extra html too
[05:36:31] <maZtah> xec: due to this line: function(responseText, responseStatus) { } it's still redirecting to the other page
[05:38:08] <denim> hello rock!
[05:40:24] <SkiOne> anyone use the datatables plugin? can you send the column names when doing server side processing?
[05:40:31] <npmap> Could anyone offer some advice regarding the randomly not working selection issue, please?
[05:41:18] <denim> create a inlineEdit box widget. The widget should be like this.    When I click on the text it should open textarea with the content and I should be able to edit the text. When I click save button or click enter key. The modified content has to be updated on the page. If I click "Esc" key the edit should cancel. That means the textarea should be replaced by old content. The widget can take a callback function for save. so If callback function is provided execut
[05:41:34] <SkiOne> npmap: perhaps you should make a bug report at the jquery website?
[05:43:00] <npmap> SkiOne: I would if I knew for sure this is a problem with jQuery. I believe it's getting broken by some HTML code inside the page or some character. This page is in charset ISO-8859-1.
[05:43:41] <SkiOne> npmap: it sounded like you did a fair amount of testing, if you make a bug request the community can validate it and at least you will know where to look
[05:43:59] <Zeddy> how is it even possible my site can make safari freeze and use 25% of my cpu
[05:44:28] <ProLoser|Trmnl> skill
[05:44:32] <ProLoser|Trmnl> that's how
[05:44:37] <xec> bad code? bad browser? bad cpu?
[05:45:37] <Zeddy> my code may not be perfect, but if it works on ie6 it sure as hell should work on safari 5
[05:46:18] <xec> maZtah: i made the example into a fiddle for you, as you can see the generated forms do not submit - http://jsfiddle.net/wbvXT/
[05:46:49] <Zeddy> even when i disable javascript, the page freezes
[05:46:50] <Zeddy> lol
[05:47:13] <ravenzz> $('a.foo').hover(function(){ $('img.foo').attr('src','foo.png'); }, function() { }); how can i add a fadeIn effect?  i wouldn't hide it
[05:47:38] <maZtah> yeah sec, it's the function(responseText, responseStatus) { } which causes the form to submit..
[05:47:38] <fmerges> GuidoBouman: i think i have to use the image replace mechanism, because just taking the data and generating a JSON of the data points it's 13.40 MB :D
[05:47:45] <maZtah> xec*
[05:47:51] <RyanD> ....
[05:48:00] <RyanD> Are you on some sort of Tandy or Amiga, zeddy?
[05:48:08] <RyanD> Perhaps a TRS-80.
[05:48:30] <Zeddy> RyanD, i7 8 Gig ram :\
[05:48:46] <RyanD> ....
[05:48:55] <GuidoBouman> fmerges:  WHOA, lol. Yeah, lets do that in replacements. flot has a feater for that tohugh.
[05:48:59] <GuidoBouman> feature*
[05:49:09] <RyanD> Can you REMOVE (not just disable) your JS code to test?
[05:49:15] <xec> maZtah: sooo its submitting the form on callback? i doubt that
[05:49:25] <Zeddy> i tried that too
[05:49:31] <RyanD> and? hmm.
[05:49:34] <maZtah> well, when i remove that function it won't submit
[05:49:38] <Zeddy> well all the $(window) and $(document).ready() stuff i removed
[05:49:44] <Zeddy> no effect
[05:49:49] <RyanD> (then hint, it might not be that ;)).
[05:50:09] <RyanD> I can't say I've come across too many, if any, JS issues in Safari.
[05:50:32] <Zeddy> okay, when disabling css, it loads fine
[05:50:33] <Zeddy> :p
[05:50:33] <maZtah> xec: i will try to go with $.ajax() instead of this crap :x
[05:50:34] <RyanD> So I'm inclined to believe PEBKAC, but chopping around bitwise might make your life easier in terms of tracking down the problem.
[05:50:38] <RyanD> LOL!
[05:50:47] <RyanD> That is, uh, odd.
[05:50:51] <npmap> It looks like my issue is being caused by jQuery not returning the right number of dl tags in the document. On both working and not working, there are 5 of them. Only 1 is selected with $('dl') on the non working document.
[05:51:04] <RyanD> interesting.
[05:51:10] <MorpheusXnl> goodafternoon
[05:51:16] <Zeddy> yeah.. im guessing safari cant handle all the css3 ?
[05:51:17] <xec> maZtah: hmm, what if you just dont do anything inside that function, just a console.log or something, what happens then?
[05:51:31] <MorpheusXnl> how can i get all the values of and select form item in a array with jquery
[05:51:32] <maZtah> it still gets submitted, xec
[05:51:36] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl:  Middag.
[05:51:55] <Zeddy> for example, i have loads of box shadows to make stuff look better, while requiring less loading of images
[05:52:04] <Zeddy> apparently in safari, i should do it the other way around :P
[05:52:05] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, goedemiddag
[05:52:56] <Trudko> guys I am using JQuerry tree table and I have problem. look here    http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/801/unleddm.jpg/   I have node with id 1562347 which as you can see is parent of 1562348 and also child 1562347. Problem is that I dont want expand / collapse button next to it  if its does not have childs.
[05:53:22] <orangejuicecup> can someone please look over my code and see if im using the basics of jquery properly? I have a page that when everything has loaded, it fades a message and loads content.  The content is loaded via json. I want to know if I am doing this right http://jsfiddle.net/uFVru/1/
[05:53:25] <GuidoBouman> $('.selectField option').each(function(){ myArr[] = $(this).attr('value'); });
[05:53:26] <Zeddy> ok, im pretty positive what is causing the error
[05:53:30] <L4suicide> if I have $.post(url,function (data) { $(document).replaceWith(data) } <-- is that the best way of updating to see the ajax call results?
[05:53:38] <Zeddy> its definately the bottom box shadow i have in my footer and under each product box
[05:53:42] <xec> maZtah: even the 1st time you click submit?
[05:53:48] <maZtah> yeah
[05:53:50] <Zeddy> i removed the footer completely, and the front page loaded fine, then i tried loading the product page
[05:53:50] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, thanks will try that one
[05:53:51] <L4suicide> as it only seems to work once per run
[05:53:53] <Zeddy> and it froze
[05:54:27] <GuidoBouman> Zeddy:  Using Crossbrowser technique?
[05:56:27] <xec> maZtah: i cant make sense of it, sorry, im guessing maybe some minor typo could cause the bind not to happen, and the javascript being ignored, resulting in submit doing what it would do with no event bound
[05:56:30] <blackspotwiggins> Zeddy, unless you have thousands of box shadows, it should not cause any problems.. then again, safari can be weird sometimes
[05:56:39] <xec> maZtah: i.e. submit
[05:56:50] <maZtah> hmm, i appreciate your help xec
[05:56:56] <blackspotwiggins> try simpligying the selector to maybe narrow it down
[05:57:00] <maZtah> i'm trying to go with an $.ajax
[05:57:17] <blackspotwiggins> or force it into gpu acceleration with 3d transform
[05:57:18] <xec> maZtah: .load() is just a shorthand for .ajax()
[05:57:24] <xec> afaik
[05:57:33] <maZtah> oh
[05:57:43] <maZtah> :p
[05:57:43] <MatthiasVance> Yes, it is.
[05:57:48] <denim> Put a simple registration form on dialog box. The registration form should have all validations. If all validations are success then only the dialog box should close. The form elements are your wish. Try to use jquery form plugin for validations.

[05:58:07] <AdvoWork> hi, im using jquery for my table data, and am doing: http://pastebin.com/n0WSHC0r  but the problem is, its sooo slow. my table and data loads fine quickly, but then it takes like 20 seconds to change the colours etc, any way I can speed it up, or where would the problem lie?
[05:58:44] <xec> maZtah: and that function you refer to is just what is called after the request is done, it should not submit anything
[05:59:06] <xec> maZtah: could you make a new paste of your modified code?
[05:59:22] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBauman, it is not working. it does not get executed.
[06:00:31] <MorpheusXnl> my code $("#airline option").each(function(){ myvarr[] = $(this.attr('value');});
[06:00:52] <Zeddy> the error is caused by the following
[06:00:52] <Zeddy> http://pastie.org/1971099
[06:00:58] <Zeddy> if i remove those 3 lines its all good
[06:01:11] <Zeddy> hmm

[06:01:13] <Zeddy> wtf

[06:02:11] <GuidoBouman> Guys, can anyone help me now?
[06:02:11] <GuidoBouman> :P
[06:02:14] <GuidoBouman> http://daniel.aikone.com/
[06:02:19] <GuidoBouman> The slider isn't sliding.
[06:02:22] <maZtah> i need to fetch the url from the method="" still..
[06:02:32] <GuidoBouman> It's the slides plugin.
[06:03:01] <Trudko> guys I am using JQuerry tree table and I have problem. look here    http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/801/unleddm.jpg/   I have node with id 1562347 which as you can see is parent of 1562348 and also child 1562347. Problem is that I dont want expand / collapse button next to it  if its does not have childs.
[06:03:16] <Zeddy> GuidoBouman, u need to activate the slider
[06:03:21] <GuidoBouman> Nope.
[06:03:23] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, did you see my message?
[06:03:31] <Zeddy> it seems like you are only loading the required javascript
[06:03:44] <GuidoBouman> Zeddy:  It's "sliding" But not it's not animated
[06:03:56] <Zeddy> do you have $(document).ready(function(){ $('#myslider').slider() }); ?
[06:03:59] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl:  Nope
[06:04:04] <Zeddy> oh
[06:04:24] <GuidoBouman> Zeddy:  The animation part of the plugin doesn't seem to work...
[06:04:26] <GuidoBouman>  =/
[06:04:31] <MorpheusXnl> my code $("#airline option").each(function(){ myvarr[] = $(this.attr('value');});
[06:04:32] <Zeddy> have u applied easing effects to it?
[06:04:51] <Zeddy> animate: true
[06:05:02] <Zeddy> ('.slides').slides({ animate:true
[06:05:17] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, i pasted it again
[06:05:45] <Zeddy> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider#option-animate
[06:08:19] <GuidoBouman> Zeddy:  It's not Slider, it's Slides (http://slidesjs.com/)
[06:08:38] <GuidoBouman> Zeddy: This is my execute.js:
[06:08:39] <GuidoBouman> 	$('.slides').slides({
[06:08:39] <GuidoBouman> 		preload: true,
[06:08:39] <GuidoBouman> 		preloadImage: '/img/loading.gif',
[06:08:39] <GuidoBouman> 		play: 5000,
[06:08:39] <GuidoBouman> 		pause: 2500,
[06:08:39] <GuidoBouman> 		hoverPause: true
[06:08:40] <GuidoBouman> 	});
[06:08:50] <GuidoBouman> That;s the default config.
[06:09:08] <GuidoBouman> Zeddy: Equal to: http://slidesjs.com/examples/standard/
[06:09:16] <GuidoBouman> His is sliding, mine isn't.
[06:10:41] <gym_jane> any regex ninjas here?
[06:10:57] <fmerges> GuidoBouman: look in detail to the example
[06:11:15] <GuidoBouman> fmerges:  Whahah, found my mistake
[06:11:18] <GuidoBouman> It was in the CSS
[06:11:41] <GuidoBouman> It uses a multiplication of the .slides in divs widths
[06:11:47] <orangejuicecup> solved it!
[06:11:48] <orangejuicecup> thanks
[06:11:54] <GuidoBouman> But I had a typo:
[06:12:02] <GuidoBouman> .box.slides .slide
[06:12:11] <GuidoBouman> Is what it's supposed to be.
[06:12:23] <GuidoBouman> .box_slides .slide is what I had..
[06:12:23] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman,  i try using alert to see if it caches values but it does not
[06:12:24] <GuidoBouman> Fail.
[06:12:44] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl:  Helping you now.
[06:12:49] <GuidoBouman> My problem is solved.
[06:13:55] <stan_man_can> Hey guys. I'm having a weird issue with jquery ui sortable ... it's just ... not binding properly? http://screencast.com/t/LTOWfdZeUvCN
[06:13:59] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl:  Try: $("#airline option").each(function(){ alert($(this)); });
[06:14:05] <GuidoBouman> Does it give you some alerts?
[06:14:41] <Trudko> ElDiabolo: duplicated ids are not ok I agree with that, same data are ok and thats problem I have same data  on different places with same database ID which is used for ID in tr element
[06:14:48] <AdvoWork> if im setting something up on document ready http://pastebin.com/LBpRdrku  can i do that on each element but only on click(set it up on click instead on all elements already) as my page has 100's and it takes a while to load
[06:15:23] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, response is [object object]
[06:15:27] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl:  http://jsfiddle.net/ Als je daar je meuk in gooit, kan ik je code modden.
[06:15:45] <Dr4g> english!
[06:17:02] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman http://jsfiddle.net/NwqWf/
[06:17:09] <GuidoBouman> Dr4g:  Sorreh, he's also dutch. I can help him faster that way.
[06:18:31] <DarsVaeda> with two input type radio buttons, how do I set id and name correctly? name must be the same for both to be recognized together and id must be different, right?
[06:20:52] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl:  Refresh, it's working for me?
[06:21:30] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: http://jsfiddle.net/NwqWf/2/
[06:21:51] <MorpheusXnl> checking
[06:22:24] <Trudko> as you can see there is 1562347 twice and in first case it does not have childnodes but because JQuery plugin I am using uses ID for creating structure it is parent in tree
[06:22:47] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, so if i know put myurl[] = than it should be captured
[06:22:48] <Joeytje50> is it possible to get data from multiple pages  with .getJSON() ?
[06:22:57] <seutje> hehe "meuk"
[06:23:14] <seutje> Joeytje50: in a single request?
[06:23:25] <Joeytje50> yeah
[06:23:45] <seutje> I suppose, if ur request goes to a proxy page that handles the separate requests for u and aggregates em
[06:23:56] <Joeytje50> I want to compare a certain part of the data of one with a certain part of the other
[06:24:33] <stan_man_can> It's been a long night... think anybody could take a look at this for me? http://screencast.com/t/LTOWfdZeUvCN Left sortable works fine... right... not so much
[06:24:33] <seutje> smells like 2 requests
[06:25:03] <seutje> u want us to debug this, based on... a freakin screencast?
[06:25:34] <stan_man_can> seutje: I know it's pathetic but it's all hosted behind a VPN on a dev server, no public access :(
[06:25:41] <seutje> oh, it's only 30 secs, guess I could watch that
[06:25:53] <stan_man_can> i was hoping you might be able to catch something in the code or something simple...
[06:26:23] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, i get syntax error on myurl[] = $(this).attr('value');
[06:26:43] <stan_man_can> seutje: if I strip out the content from the list items  it looks like this http://pastebin.com/4gG37sB3
[06:26:51] <seutje> stan_man_can: my guess would be a clearing issue that would make the elements have no height, and thus unclickable
[06:26:56] <crankharder> hrm... replacing "click("  with "live('click'," -- makes my function stop working.. no errors, just no more click handler, why would tha tbe?
[06:27:31] <Joeytje50> so seutje: if it smells like 2 requests, how could I do that?
[06:27:40] <seutje> stan_man_can: as u can prolly see, the draggable border that appears around it is 0px in height
[06:28:16] <Trudko> guys I am using JQuerry tree table and I have problem. look here    http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/801/unleddm.jpg/   I have node with id 1562347 which as you can see is parent of 1562348 and also child 1562347. Problem is that I dont want expand / collapse button next to it  if its does not have childs.
[06:28:39] <seutje> stan_man_can: also, consider using outline instead, so ur content doesn't jump all over the place
[06:28:45] <seutje> or check ur border-collapse
[06:28:58] <stan_man_can> seutje: thanks, good call
[06:29:19] <seutje> and I could have made that call with just a screenshot! :P
[06:29:23] <fmerges> GuidoBouman: was thinking right now instead of generating a lot of small images, i can also generate one realy big image that represents the graph and use something like the jqZoom :)
[06:29:33] <stan_man_can> :P
[06:29:34] <stan_man_can> lol
[06:30:31] <stan_man_can> actually it looks like it doesn't like whats being filled in
[06:30:39] <stan_man_can> if i change the content of the list items to just some plain text it works okay
[06:30:47] <stan_man_can> when i populate it with the tables ect. it goes wonky
[06:31:05] <AdvoWork> whats it called if i want to have a lightbox type effect to grey out everything apart from a certain table row?
[06:32:32] <stan_man_can> seutje: http://screencast.com/t/Ruwud4DO1
[06:32:44] <stan_man_can> just text it works like a charm but when it's populated with the tables it gets wonky

[06:34:11] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: http://jsfiddle.net/NwqWf/5/
[06:34:36] <GuidoBouman> fmerges: Does jqZoom actually fetch parts of the HUGE image?
[06:35:32] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, it says Nan
[06:35:35] <safzouf> Hi all :)
[06:35:53] <safzouf> for the jCarouselLite, I want to change the with of the list?
[06:36:07] <safzouf> how to do that for the verticall list?
[06:36:07] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl:  LOL, fail, missing an h
[06:36:08] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, you made typo
[06:36:16] <MorpheusXnl> yeah found that also lol
[06:36:55] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, can you explain me what happens there
[06:37:33] <AdvoWork> can i grey out my page somehow, apart from one div?
[06:39:40] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, what is the .length thing
[06:39:59] <Aamir> ?modal @AdvoWork
[06:40:58] <seutje> stan_man_can: does it clear?
[06:41:05] <Aamir> AdvoWork: http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/#examples
[06:42:17] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: JavaScript needs an array index. Indexes start at 0, so the length is always 1 higher than the index.
[06:42:52] <MorpheusXnl> why is the length alwasy one higher
[06:42:53] <rethus> can i set two vars to same value like this:
[06:42:54] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: So you can use the length for the index of the next array element.
[06:42:54] <L4suicide> how can i refresh the document content using $.get ?
[06:43:12] <rethus> foo =bar = "asdf"?
[06:43:14] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: Because indexes start counting at 0 instead of 1
[06:43:20] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, because it starts at 0 and length counts it as one
[06:43:34] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: Bingo.
[06:43:36] <MorpheusXnl> so length says 3 when the index is 0 1 2
[06:43:40] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[06:44:00] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouwman thank you i understand now
[06:44:08] <Brodingo> thats cute
[06:44:25] <Shwaiil> Q: How to cast to int something like $(el).css('height'), that outputs 100px for example ? thank you!
[06:44:42] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Mastering_Javascript_Arrays#quickIDX32
[06:44:44] <GuidoBouman> ;)
[06:44:48] <Aamir> ?Shwaiil parseInt
[06:44:58] <MorpheusXnl> GuidBouman thanx
[06:44:59] <Aamir> hh
[06:45:06] <Aamir> yes
[06:45:08] <Aamir> :P
[06:45:30] <Shwaiil> Aamir, I tryed to parseInt but there's no output at all
[06:45:45] <Aamir> Shwaiil:  parseInt(value,10) ?
[06:45:52] <Shwaiil> maybe sintax error i'll check console.log again
[06:45:59] <AdvoWork> Aamir,  the thing is, this is for a table, so i need to hide everything apart from one row with a certain id..
[06:46:06] <Shwaiil> Aamir, but anyway, if 100px parseInt will give me 100 right ?
[06:46:25] <Aamir> Shwaiil: yes
[06:47:07] <Aamir> AdvoWork:  table.find('tr:not("#trId")').hide()
[06:47:40] <S1kx> jQuery-Mobile question: is there a way to put a finder on a select? (like on a ul would be data-filter="true"?
[06:51:38] <TigerPro> hi guys, im pretty new to jquery but im having an issue
[06:52:23] <TigerPro> basically, im interrupting fades on elements. when i try to re-fade in those elements, it does not completely fade back in
[06:52:37] <TigerPro> only to where to was previously interrupted
[06:52:39] <crankharder> why doesn't clicking the "X" icon work here: http://www.veloracing.com/busted_live_handler.html -- relevant jquery is right before </body> -- switching it back to ordinary click() works fine
[06:53:38] <AdvoWork> Aamir, shouldnt that be: $('table.maintable').find('tr:not("#new_sort_row")').hide() ?
[06:54:03] <Aamir> AdvoWork:  yes
[06:54:17] <GuidoBouman> TigerPro: Probarly you're using .stop(true), try stop(true, true);
[06:54:23] <AdvoWork> Aamir, anyway, that works, but all i want to do is sort of black out the other rows, not totally hide them, is that possible?
[06:54:52] <Aamir> AdvoWork:  try using fadeTo
[06:56:12] <TigerPro> thanks for the help, let me try that out
[06:57:08] <c3l> whats the best way to server push new data to client as soon as it is available, and let client act on that data?
[06:57:38] <GuidoBouman> c3l: That's opening an socket.

[07:01:09] <GuidoBouman> AdvoWork: Aamir: http://jsfiddle.net/sdCAY/1/
[07:01:14] <GreyTrilby> Problem with Jquery UI tabs. Have two pages, both similar using identical code. Tab one works, tab 2 doesn't. If I swap the order so it runs tab2 THEN tab 1, it works. I've tweaked code so it uses different selectors (and changed html accordingly) but whatever is in the 2nd position doesn't work. Help!
[07:01:42] <GuidoBouman> Nevermind, that's not really stopping the full queue
[07:01:44] <GreyTrilby> to clarify whatever is in the first tab position works, whatever is in the second, doesn't
[07:01:44] <Aamir> AdvoWork: or http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/sdCAY/2/
[07:03:24] <GuidoBouman> Aamir: AdvoWork: http://jsfiddle.net/sdCAY/3/ ;)
[07:03:36] <GuidoBouman> Aamir: Your click looks better.
[07:04:24] <Aamir> AdvoWork: i guess you should use css :hover :P
[07:07:15] <AdvoWork> thanks for the examples!!
[07:08:05] <AdvoWork> im also adding a new table row to my table by doing: $('table.maintable tr:first').after(tableString);   which works fine, but the widths of the new td's dont match the widths of the existing ones, because of the content of the existing. any ideas of a way around that?
[07:08:14] <GreyTrilby> Just moved my second tab to 3rd position (with a blank tab in position 2) - it now works. This seems to be a bug - anyone know what the workaround is?
[07:08:46] <jonclark> maybe there's a duplicate ID?
[07:09:02] <GreyTrilby> jonclark - I thought that - but I'm buggered if I can see it!
[07:09:31] <jonclark> so it doesn't matter what you name the 2nd tab, never switches there?
[07:09:38] <GreyTrilby> nope
[07:09:57] <GreyTrilby> rather, it switches there, but the code in the page that's loaded in it doesn't work
[07:10:03] <GreyTrilby> or specifically, some of it doesn't work!
[07:10:21] <jonclark> fix the code outside of the tabs for now
[07:10:25] <jonclark> once it works put it back in
[07:10:29] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouwman, are you still here
[07:10:49] <GreyTrilby> in this case: <li>tab1</li><li>tab2</li><li>tab3</li> I'm loading page 1, page 2, page 3
[07:11:00] <GreyTrilby> The pages load into the tabs without a problem
[07:11:19] <GreyTrilby> page 1 and page 2 are very similar
[07:11:30] <GreyTrilby> there is no page 3 - it's just a blank, disabled tab
[07:11:45] <GreyTrilby> page 1 in tab 1 works perfectly
[07:12:04] <GreyTrilby> page 2 in tab 2 will load and perform part of it's operations, but a couple of jquery functions fail to work
[07:12:11] <GreyTrilby> page 3, as I say, does not exist
[07:12:39] <AdvoWork> is it possible to add new table rows so that the new tds match the existing td widths? im doing: $('table.maintable tr:first').after(tableString);
[07:12:55] <GreyTrilby> if I relink it so that page 3 loads in tab 2 (i.e. tab 2 is disabled) and I load page 2 into tab 3, page 2 works perfectly!
[07:13:22] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl:  Try hitting gu and tab.
[07:13:30] <GuidoBouman> Makes you spell my name correctly. ;)
[07:13:46] <MorpheusXnl> it is not working some problems in this software
[07:13:56] <Ely^> Hi anyone an idea why I get this kind of error in Chrome: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<an HTMLTableRowElement> has no method 'addClass' and nothing in FF // Code: http://jsfiddle.net/nF7fU/11/
[07:14:17] <jonclark> GreyTrilby: are you getting any errors in your console when it's in tab 2?
[07:14:18] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: What's up?
[07:14:25] <GreyTrilby> nope - not a sausage.
[07:14:41] <shomon> hi, sorry to bother you if it's all the same people. I'm picking up on a project where Ihave to only add a jquery tooltip (the rest is PHP and it's fine). The previous developer knew jquery so he's got stuff in there that I can't remove or conflict with. But the tooltip code is conflicting with it.
[07:15:17] <shomon> how can I find out what is conflicting? http://jsbin.com/upoka5/19/edit
[07:15:19] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, i am trying to get the url from the options list and then append some text behind it. i will make somehing on fiddle in a minute could you take a look at that
[07:15:35] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: Sure
[07:16:00] <GreyTrilby> it's like when you don't have your selectors correct - it just doesn't work. But it DOES work when in tab 3!
[07:16:13] <GreyTrilby> and I know my selectors are correct!
[07:16:18] <jonclark> i'm sorry GreyTrilby i don't know what i can do to help
[07:16:20] <shomon> I've looked at this page: http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries but although I'm using jQuery.noConflict() it still conflicts with the other jquery stuff
[07:16:24] <mustefaj> is there a function that waits for all content to load (even dynamically loaded ajax content) before executing jquery code
[07:16:25] <mustefaj> ?
[07:16:26] <jonclark> if you provide a link to your code people might jump on it
[07:16:33] <jonclark> but never heard of that bug before
[07:16:35] <mustefaj> something like document.ready but with ajax hype
[07:16:37] <shomon> I also don't under stand why you need lots of different versions of jquery each time you want to do something different
[07:16:47] <rethus> how can i add a whole div-layer Content with jquery to an Textarea?
[07:17:03] <jonclark> shomon that's not really the case
[07:17:33] <jonclark> jquery does update often, but i wouldn't say i'm ever forced to update for compatibility's sake
[07:17:37] <shomon> well, I'm new to jquery so it may be that all that obfuscated js code already has functions in it for tooltips
[07:17:54] <timmywil> Ely^: seems to work fine: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/nF7fU/12/   That error might mean jQuery has not loaded.
[07:20:26] <daReaper> hi
[07:20:32] <shomon> jonclark, also, some of these files might be the same. I can't make head or tail of it:jquery.maskedinput-1.2.2.min.js jquery.alerts.js jquery.alerts.js <- all these are there already and I can't remove them. can I keep them and just add jquery.ui.tooltip.js or some other file that will actually work with the previous ones?
[07:20:40] <daReaper> is there a jquery way of sorting an object by its keys?
[07:21:49] <jonclark> are you sure those files are causing a problem?
[07:22:04] <jonclark> can you remove all the other scripts except jquery, jquery ui and the tooltip stuff?
[07:22:11] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hey I have a bunch of divs with class "videoImageBox"
[07:22:23] <Nicolas_Leonidas> is there a way to know if the currently selected div, is the last one ?
[07:22:45] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, http://jsfiddle.net/XdM2D/    format of the number in prefix 074-123568
[07:22:49] <shomon> If I remove those files, it works.. but I don't get any error messages if they *are* there so it's hard to tell what is happening
[07:22:53] <jonclark> ?q index Nicolas_Leonidas
[07:23:04] <jonclark> bot-t? doh
[07:23:35] <jonclark> Nicolas_Leonidas: http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:23:41] <orangejuicecup> can someone help me append html to a list?
[07:24:50] <dtach> Nicolas_Leonidas: http://api.jquery.com/last/
[07:24:53] <jonclark> orangejuicecup: don't ask to ask, just ask :)
[07:25:00] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, did you recieve my url
[07:25:20] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: Yep, but what's your intention. It's getting a bit unclear.
[07:25:49] <MorpheusXnl> well it needs to append prefs[1] as text behind var url
[07:26:14] <MorpheusXnl> so i create a new url and this one i am going to use to open a new windows to a site
[07:26:49] <orangejuicecup> Im having trouble getting json results to be appended in list format, I tried adding <li> tags to my <br> tags but that causes no results to be displayed at all http://jsfiddle.net/DdxKq/
[07:27:28] <RTPMatt> ?sop @ orangejuicecup
[07:28:00] <orangejuicecup> RTPMatt: ?
[07:28:14] <dtach> bot aint workin
[07:28:18] <RTPMatt> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[07:28:26] <RTPMatt> so i see
[07:28:30] <GreyTrilby> @orangejuice - is the data definitely being retrieved correctly?
[07:28:49] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ok if an element has two classes
[07:28:54] <Nicolas_Leonidas> how do you get them?
[07:29:08] <dtach> Nicolas_Leonidas: two classes??
[07:29:13] <orangejuicecup> GreyTrilby: I think so since it works right now
[07:29:14] <RTPMatt>  Nicolas_Leonidas: $(e).attr('class') ?
[07:29:26] <Nicolas_Leonidas> yeah, like <div class="class1 class2"
[07:29:36] <Nicolas_Leonidas> how do I check if this div has class2?
[07:30:07] <markj> ?hasClass @ Nicolas_Leonidas
[07:30:07] <RTPMatt> Nicolas_Leonidas: .hasClass('class2')
[07:30:10] <wailqill> $(e).is('.class')
[07:30:14] <GreyTrilby> hmmm...dunno then - are you able to append manually (hardcode a variable)
[07:30:20] <Nicolas_Leonidas> wow interesting, thanks markj
[07:30:23] <markj> no bot-t today :[
[07:30:28] <orangejuicecup> me?
[07:30:31] <GreyTrilby> yeah
[07:30:48] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: Right now it's not working at all. The alert doesn't work?
[07:30:49] <orangejuicecup> like item.data.title?
[07:30:59] <GreyTrilby> yeah
[07:31:00] <MorpheusXnl> correct
[07:31:09] <GreyTrilby> go through the workflow
[07:31:24] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, correct
[07:31:47] <ravenzz> mh i want to select any element that has font size <= 11px
[07:31:49] <GreyTrilby> hardcode something you want to be appended, see if you can append it, then try and pull the dynamic into that variable - it should then append
[07:31:51] <ravenzz> how i can do that?
[07:32:51] <GreyTrilby> ravenzz - using the css calss that defines the fontsize of that element?
[07:33:53] <djQuery> ravenzz: .filter(function(){  var fs = $(this).css("font-size"); return (fs<11);   })
[07:33:56] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, i wonder why it is not alerting because i think it should
[07:34:19] <GreyTrilby> er... or what he said :)
[07:34:24] <ravenzz> ah sure. i forgot filter()
[07:34:29] <ravenzz> thank you djQuery
[07:34:32] <GreyTrilby> right - best tackle my own issues ttfn!
[07:34:34] <djQuery> ravenzz: not sure css("font-size") will return 11 or 11px
[07:34:44] <ravenzz> i suppose 11px
[07:34:49] <djQuery> or medium or small etc
[07:34:51] <ravenzz> anyway that's not a problem
[07:34:57] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, http://jsfiddle.net/XdM2D/2/
[07:35:23] <mustefaj> is there any way to load jquery code after ajax call without a call back using some kind of doc. ready or something?
[07:36:15] <ravenzz> there is some crappy css there...so i should write a function to increase/decrease the font-size for usability purposes
[07:36:17] <MorpheusXnl> brb
[07:36:46] <djQuery> mustefaj: not realy. .load("myurl.aspx/php", {}, function(){I am the callback});
[07:37:13] <djQuery> mustefaj: it needs something to call when the load finishes some variable time in the future
[07:39:28] <mustefaj> yeah ok cool
[07:39:29] <mustefaj> thanks
[07:40:41] <ravenzz> djQuery return (fs=="11px");  is this ok, right?
[07:40:56] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, any idea
[07:41:57] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: http://jsfiddle.net/XdM2D/4/
[07:41:57] <djQuery> ?giat@ravenzz
[07:41:58] <GuidoBouman> Done
[07:42:06] <djQuery> ?bot-t
[07:42:07] <MorpheusXnl> i will check
[07:42:17] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[07:42:17] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 2 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[07:42:24] <djQuery> lazy bot again
[07:42:58] <kranZ> hello
[07:43:15] <GuidoBouman> Kai.
[07:43:16] <djQuery> mustefaj: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[07:43:19] <GuidoBouman> Hai*
[07:43:20] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, thanks i was also in this direction but this did it thank you
[07:43:39] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl: You had too much complexity.
[07:43:49] <kranZ> i would like to change the z-index for the autocomplete results, i have added z-index to .ui-autocomplete in my ui theme but it seems to get ignored
[07:43:56] <MorpheusXnl> yeah i thought so
[07:45:09] <jeffsmykil> syntax for checking context of variable from console?
[07:46:12] <jeffsmykil> context==content
[07:47:57] <AdvoWork> is it possible to add new table rows so that the new tds match the existing td widths? im doing: $('table.maintable tr:first').after(tableString);
[07:49:52] <GuidoBouman> MorpheusXnl:  http://jsfiddle.net/XdM2D/9/ So, now it actually exactly does what you want.
[07:59:11] <MorpheusXnl> GuidoBouman, i created something like that also you also do some checking if it is filled in
[07:59:20] <orangejuicecup> damn I cant hardcore them
[08:02:39] <jtmo> Can someone help me with jqueryUI sortable?  I'm having trouble incorporating the "grid" template with my own data
[08:04:32] <Nicolas_Leonidas> how can you get the number of divs inside a div ?
[08:05:34] <MatthiasVance> $(div).filter("div").length?
[08:05:44] <MatthiasVance> @ Nicolas_Leonidas
[08:05:49] <MatthiasVance> (not sure though, you'd have to try it out)
[08:06:51] <djQuery> Nicolas_Leonidas: var $parentDiv = $('#parentdiv'), chidldivs= $parentDiv.children('div').length, descendats = $parentDiv.find('div').length;
[08:07:09] <logankoester> Given a small link positioned z-above a larger link, how can I prevent the second (large link) click event?
[08:07:35] <djQuery> MatthiasVance: yout exampel wont realy work.
[08:07:43] <jtmo> My jqueryUI sortable is only sorting vertically if i disable float: left in the style :(
[08:07:59] <Nicolas_Leonidas> djQuery: yeah that worked great, thanks
[08:09:22] <djQuery> Nicolas_Leonidas: just dont expect me to spell descendents correctly
[08:11:37] <Nicolas_Leonidas> so I wanna know what's the index of the div that has videoImageBoxImageCurrentlySelected class
[08:11:50] <Nicolas_Leonidas> $('.videoImageBox').find('.videoImageBoxImageCurrentlySelected').index
[08:11:51] <mazzachre> When attaching ajaxError, where can I read what the objects are my handler is called with? I get an event, jqxhr, settings and a exception object... What is inside these? And more to the point... Where can I get if the current Ajax error is due to an internal server error, some other error or an authentication error (403 or 401)
[08:11:57] <Nicolas_Leonidas> doesn't return a number though
[08:13:46] <mazzachre> Nicolas_Leonidas: What do you want with the index? AFAIK $('.x').find('.y') returns a list of objects (DOM instance wrapped) and you need to figure out what you want to do with those
[08:14:14] <rethus> can i lay an empty div-layer above some input-fields to prevent from clicking them?
[08:14:31] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I wanna show the number in a textbox, so it's gonna be like 1/4, or 2/4 or 3/4 or 4/4 if there are 4 divs
[08:14:36] <markj> rethus cant you just disable the inputs?
[08:14:46] <markj> in theory you can though yes
[08:14:53] <manixrock> how can I make a <div> no go over a floating div without using overflow:hidden ?
[08:15:03] <manixrock> I need for elements to go outside of the <div> and still be visible
[08:15:24] <rethus> markj: i search for a realy fast option, and i try to use a layer with white bg-color opacity:0.5
[08:15:30] <rethus> should give a special efect
[08:16:09] <Nicolas_Leonidas> how do I do this properly? .index($('.videoImageBox').find('.videoImageBoxImageCurrentlySelected')) ;
[08:16:39] <poppiez> hi, after upgrading to 1.6.1 I can't do $('body').show(); I have to do $('body').css( 'display', 'block' ); for the body to show itself. in CSS I have body { display: none; }
[08:16:54] <poppiez> why is this?
[08:17:33] <timmywil> poppiez: it's a bug
[08:17:47] <timmywil> poppiez: will be fixed in 1.6.2
[08:18:15] <poppiez> timmywil: alright, only for the body tag or are other tags affected?
[08:18:19] <rethus> how can i use a div as overlay above some inputfields with opacity 0.5 - to prevent from using the fields?
[08:18:25] <toot> hey, when writing a plugin i set 'options', how them am i to access those options from within the plugins functions ?
[08:18:25] <timmywil> poppiez: html as well
[08:18:33] <timmywil> poppiez: that should be it thoug
[08:18:38] <poppiez> timmywil: thank you :)
[08:18:44] <timmywil> poppiez: np
[08:19:36] <djQuery> rethus: var inpt = $('#myinput'); $('<div />', {'z-index': (inpt.css('z-index') || 0) + 1).css({position: 'absolute', top: inp.top(), left: inp.left(), width: inp.width()}).after(inpt);
[08:19:42] <djQuery> somethin like that
[08:20:17] <djQuery> rethus: seems easier to just disable the input
[08:20:35] <mazzachre> Don't anyone know where the objects I get in the callback to ajaxError are described? I need to figure out if the ajaxError was caused by an authentication error or something else, how do I do that?
[08:22:00] <djQuery> mazzachre: sure see ?.ajax
[08:22:07] <djQuery> sutpid lazy bot
[08:22:21] <djQuery> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:22:30] <djQuery> mazzachre: ^^^^
[08:22:50] <rethus> djQuery:: i don't understand where is the overlay-div on your example?  http://jsfiddle.net/PmAJ6/
[08:23:29] <necromancer> can you have a DOM ready call in a plugin definition?
[08:23:40] <necromancer> or should i just instruct people to call the plugin in the .ready()?
[08:23:49] <djQuery> rethus: well myinput was supposed to be the name of the input itself
[08:24:09] <rethus> you mean the input-field?
[08:24:28] <rethus> i need a layer above another layer, that contains all this input-fields
[08:25:12] <rethus> what does your second line exactly do?
[08:25:56] <jtmo> Does sortable need to have each "widget" a fixed constant size?
[08:28:42] <rethus> djQuery: result schould look like this: http://jsfiddle.net/PmAJ6/1/
[08:30:38] <AdvoWork> im trying to use fadeto for my page, apart from one div. im doing $('body').find('not(".demo")').fadeTo('fast','0.33');   but nothing, if i do: $('body').fadeTo('fast','0.33'); it works fine, but fades everything. any ideas please?
[08:31:31] <Anitox> you may want a colon on the 'not'
[08:31:36] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: the selector is ":not", not "not"
[08:32:00] <quicksilver> $('body :not(.demo)') would be more natural.
[08:32:42] <bakers> I have an ajax request that has a failure function that does alert(textStatus) if a user clicks a link while the ajax is still firing it generates an "error" is there a way to capture that? It's not REALLY an error as much as it is an abort
[08:32:44] <djQuery> rethus: after fixing some of the obzious typos http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/PmAJ6/2/ but dont know why the z-index isnt workin
[08:33:13] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, thanks
[08:35:07] <quicksilver> bakers: if you read the docs on the error callback you sill see it has several parameters which tell you what actually happened.
[08:35:26] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, actually, that makes it virtually crash, everything looks faded too
[08:45:11] <orolo> i'm looking at some code where a an object is created like so:  someDomElement = $('.someDomeElement', foo); where 'foo' is the parent element.
[08:45:43] <orolo> is that conventional?
[08:47:19] <markj> foo is the context, so it only looks inside that element for whats on the left. I believe it is faster but dont quote me on that
[08:48:01] <orolo> markj, you're unsure if it's faster or if it's the context?
[08:48:06] <DJTrey> im changing a div's background image on a jquery.mouseover. is firefox known to be sluggish and have a delay when doing that? it works fine in chrome and IE.
[08:48:09] <bakers> I wrote a quick test case... http://www.perturb.org/tmp/ajax-abort.html
[08:48:18] <markj> unsure if its faster, sorry
[08:48:20] <bakers> I really think that should throw an abort error, not an "error" error
[08:48:23] <markj> its definitely the context
[08:48:30] <bakers> someone take a look at that before I submit a bug?
[08:48:32] <orolo> markj helpful. thanks.
[08:49:45] <phlp> orolo: it is equivalent to foo.find('.someElement') which is faster http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#selector-context
[08:54:41] <orolo> yup. there is is in v1: jQuery( selector, [ context ] )
[08:56:24] <Defusal> hi everyone
[08:56:59] <Defusal> i dont know the inner details of jquery ajax requests since i have only ever needed to use them for loading data, etc
[08:58:28] <Defusal> but i need to find out what the best way would be to use jquery ajax requests to create an internet stability check between the server and the website, i need something similar to monitoring 20 - 60 ICMP responses

[09:10:02] <Disperati2> hey everyone im having some problems, any1 willing to help?
[09:10:37] <rethus> puh, that regex-stuff is to hard for me
[09:10:50] <hobs> well
[09:10:56] <hobs> have you tried rubular rethus
[09:11:02] <hobs> it makes regex stuff easy
[09:11:12] <hobs> also Disperati2, !ask
[09:11:12] <rethus> hobs: what is this
[09:11:33] <hobs> its ruby oriented but it makes regex a lot easier to comprehend
[09:11:34] <hobs> http://rubular.com/
[09:11:57] <hobs> you type in the regular expression in the box, it has all the expressions below and then you put your string you want to match against in the test string area
[09:12:54] <hobs> I am not a regular expression master but this is a good tool for me
[09:13:06] <necromancer`brb> hobs: does this work with any other language's spec of regex besides ruby?
[09:13:20] <rethus> problem are these tow ( )
[09:13:21] <beasty> necromancer: ofc
[09:13:34] <necromancer> beasty: what does that mean?
[09:13:59] <beasty> they work with java, js, perl, python and php
[09:14:24] <necromancer> beasty: they're all very different versions of regex, though. so syntax doesn't carry over all the time
[09:14:48] <necromancer> php uses PCRE, but javascript uses a much more simplified version
[09:14:51] <necromancer> no idea about ruby
[09:15:48] <beasty> necromancer: posix ?
[09:15:50] <skamikaze> rethus: "(foo )".replace( \(.*(?=\)), "(" )
[09:16:09] <jbwiv> guys, I have an <input/> of type text. In the source, value is set to '2011-04-01', but nothing shows up in the text box. jquery says that both val() and text() of the element is "". Can anyone imagine why this is?
[09:16:11] <skamikaze> oh sry no delimiters
[09:16:27] <skamikaze> rethus: "(foo )".replace( /\(.*(?=\))/, "(" )
[09:16:31] <beasty> jbwiv: is the id set ?
[09:16:39] <beasty> jbwiv: did you add a # ?
[09:16:42] <jbwiv> beasty, yes, it's set
[09:16:48] <jbwiv> beasty, yes
[09:16:51] <beasty> like alert('#foo').val());
[09:17:06] <beasty> value="..." />
[09:17:07] <necromancer> beasty: no idea
[09:17:14] <koesbong> jbwiv: jsfiddle?
[09:17:19] <necromancer> pcre stands for perl-compatible regex
[09:17:25] <jbwiv> koesbong: ok, one sec
[09:17:57] <rethus> skamikaze: in regexpal.com it doesn't work with thie string "asdfasdf ( all inkl.)"
[09:18:37] <beasty> when i use regex i just write them
[09:18:39] <jbwiv> ah, one thing to mention. this field is a datepicker field, and date picker isn't configured until the bottom of the file...
[09:18:43] <beasty> test/fail/retry
[09:19:15] <beasty> jbwiv: use a $(function() { alert('#foo').val());  });
[09:19:20] <logankoester> How can you use CSS selectors on array attributes? This doesn't seem to work: $('input[type=food[fruits]]')
[09:19:20] <rethus> skamikaze http://jsfiddle.net/7fTBM/1/
[09:19:24] <logankoester> http://jsbin.com/ezexo4/3/edit

[09:24:21] <beasty> rethus: http://jsfiddle.net/ypbNs/
[09:24:44] <jbwiv> ok, so it appears removing this code fixes it '$( ".datepicker" ).datepicker( "option", "dateFormat", "yy-mm-dd")'. However, I really need to set the format on this field...and the data which isn't appearing really is formatted properly. any ideas?
[09:25:13] <beasty> jbwiv: did you try what i sugested ?
[09:25:32] <jbwiv> beasty, your alert() above?

[09:27:25] <beasty> and replace the #foo with the id
[09:27:28] <srj55> I have a line:   $(responseText).find('#ResultWrapper').html()  which is not including all content inside this #ResultWrapper   --it's not including <script></script> inside this.  How do I have it include everything?
[09:27:55] <jbwiv> beasty, you mean run that from the console?
[09:28:27] <jbwiv> it just printed the id in an alert box
[09:28:56] <koesbong> logankoester: did you figure it out?
[09:29:02] <logankoester> koesbong: nope
[09:29:07] <jbwiv>  beasty and then gave a TypeError: alert("#foo") is undefined
[09:29:24] <koesbong> logankoester: http://jsfiddle.net/tDqG7/2/
[09:30:16] <jbwiv> it comes down to datepicker clearing the field value when the option dateFormat is added
[09:31:46] <logankoester> koesbong: heh, I tried that but I must have had a typo somewhere - thanks man
[09:32:07] <koesbong> logankoester: gladly
[09:34:56] <jbwiv> so anyone know of a way to prevent this  from clearing a text box it's applied to?
[09:34:57] <jbwiv> $( ".datepicker" ).datepicker( "option", "dateFormat", "yy-mm-dd")
[09:37:08] <blorbx> hi, i'm trying to have jquery create links to perform functions on certain parts of the html document
[09:37:15] <blorbx> my code seems to be behaving weirdly though
[09:39:02] <blorbx> i basically have $("#content").each(function(i){
[09:39:12] <dabear> I bet .live is your solution
[09:39:40] <koesbong> blorbx: jsfiddle?
[09:40:44] <blorbx> $("#linkarea").append(<a href>link1</a>).click(function() {
[09:41:03] <blorbx> $alert(i);
[09:41:17] <blorbx> jsfiddle?
[09:41:40] <blorbx> it seems like a simple problem, but it seems i'm not clear on how jquery is interpreting my code
[09:42:22] <blorbx> basically, for each item in the #content section, i would like to make a link which has a .click function attached to it
[09:42:39] <blorbx> which will act on the corresponding item in #content
[09:42:58] <koesbong> blorbx: http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:43:19] <koesbong> paste your code there, save, and share
[09:44:12] <rt10k> howdy
[09:44:54] <ch3mical> ?p @ blorbx
[09:44:55] <bot-t> blorbx, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[09:45:56] <rt10k> let's say i have an array called "names", filled with peoples' names and i want to create 100 div elements, each with a name in it. how can i do that?
[09:47:04] <ch3mical> rt10k: see ?each
[09:47:04] <bot-t> rt10k, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:47:19] <ch3mical> or see ?jquery.each
[09:47:20] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[09:48:07] <rt10k> woah. cool! didn't realize each did that
[09:48:07] <ch3mical> Or just use a for loop (faster if you have a large data set)
[09:48:49] <blorbx> ch3mical: ? p ?
[09:50:10] <rt10k> also: that doesn't solve the element creation problem
[09:50:50] <mattp_> is $("tr:.template-download") the proper way to select all tr's with the template-download class?
[09:51:43] <koesbong> mattp_: $("tr.template-download") or even $(".template-download') should be enough
[09:52:15] <rt10k> this is the sort of ridiculous code i've got in mind right now: $(names).each(function(i){ <div class="'+names[i]+'">'+names[i]+'</div>' })
[09:52:38] <blorbx> http://jsfiddle.net/rdkbJ/
[09:52:48] <rt10k> surely this can be done in a less funky way
[09:53:05] <mattp_> koesbong: ah cool :). whats the : do in a selector?
[09:53:25] <rt10k> make that: $(names).each(function(i){ $('body').prepend('<div class="'+names[i]+'">'+names[i]+'</div>' })
[09:53:51] <blorbx> so if you click on one of the numbered divs at the top, i would like it to alert with the div number
[09:53:59] <blorbx> but it does it 3 times instead
[09:54:08] <blorbx> and it always has 4 as the number
[09:55:12] <Jayflux> paul_irish|Cloud you about?
[09:58:21] <koesbong> rt10k: i used for loop - http://jsfiddle.net/sxwbC/
[09:58:40] <koesbong> rt10k: and here's one with $.each - http://jsfiddle.net/sxwbC/1/
[10:00:36] <blorbx> anyone know what i'm doing wrong?
[10:00:38] <koesbong> blorbx, you may want to use .delegate for that
[10:00:39] <rt10k> hey, thanks koe
[10:01:31] <blorbx> koesbong: ok, i'll look into that. but can you explain to me what jquery is doing with my code?
[10:01:44] <blorbx> koesbong: it just doesn't make sense to me what it's doing
[10:03:37] <crankharder> any ideas why live('click' isn't working on this "X" icon: http://www.veloracing.com/busted_live_handler.html -- relevant JS is just above </body>
[10:03:47] <felo> I am having an issue where I have two forms submiting but both of them submit to the same tag id
[10:04:04] <felo> I want them to go in different divs
[10:04:36] <felo> how can I select to different ids
[10:05:24] <j00bar> howdy! i'm looking for a widget to help me with this style user interface - i don't even know what you'd call it: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3049229/bitbucket-users.png
[10:06:09] <j00bar> where there's a list of items with x's next to them to remove them from a list, and a blank at the bottom there is an autocomplete combo box with an add button
[10:06:15] <j00bar> any suggestions?
[10:06:52] <felo> don;t have idea it looks like an accordion but it is not
[10:07:11] <felo> how is that widget working because that only a picture
[10:07:33] <jinxdone> j00bar, that seems like the kind of thing that should be pretty easy to code yourself
[10:07:49] <j00bar> jinxdone: i could code it, sure - i just hate reinventing the wheel
[10:07:53] <jinxdone> j00bar.. i guess the list of users could be inside a grid
[10:07:55] <felo> what is the functionality of it joobar
[10:08:29] <j00bar> felo: it's like a multi-select. remove selected items by clicking on the red X. add new items by filling in the blank and clicking "grant access".
[10:09:27] <koesbong> blorbx: http://jsfiddle.net/rdkbJ/1/
[10:09:47] <felo> that looks pretty easy
[10:09:50] <felo> you need a form
[10:09:55] <felo> you have hte html ?
[10:10:26] <j00bar> i'm positive i could do it myself. i didn't know if there was a widget anybody knew of already written or the name for such a UI element that i could google for.
[10:10:42] <j00bar> i don't like rewriting what somebody else has written well already.
[10:10:50] <blorbx> koesbong: thanks, but is there a way to have the alert reference each item's index number?
[10:10:51] <felo> I understand
[10:11:02] <blorbx> koesbong: right now they all have the same alert
[10:11:05] <felo> i am working in something similar to that
[10:11:07] <felo> a form
[10:11:18] <felo> yours looks like posting a comment
[10:11:38] <felo> the only thing it will have functionality to erase is very similar to posting a coment and deleting it
[10:11:53] <jinxdone> j00bar, I think that kind of thing is usually used with a grid. I'm pretty sure slickgrid and jqgrid have an example for that
[10:11:57] <koesbong> blorbx: http://jsfiddle.net/rdkbJ/2/
[10:12:09] <j00bar> jinxdone: the grid part (read/write/admin) is not important to me
[10:12:30] <jinxdone> j00bar, yeah but they might have an input box like that to insert new rows
[10:12:32] <jinxdone> already
[10:12:38] <j00bar> the user interface (delete button, add button, ajax autocomplete combo box, <select multiple>) is.
[10:12:46] <j00bar> jinxdone: will go look then.
[10:12:57] <jinxdone> and they often have features to render data manually
[10:13:26] <felo> yes an input tag
[10:13:27] <jinxdone> which might be useful for the read/write/owner bits rendering in the grid
[10:13:31] <felo> pull them up in the box
[10:13:35] <djQuery> j00bar: looks like a 20 min project to me
[10:13:36] <blorbx> koesbong: hm, that seems to work.. but is there a way for the click function to reference the original item
[10:13:50] <blorbx> koesbong: for instance if instead of doing an alert, i wanted the click to hide the item
[10:13:55] <felo> pull up the data to the box have a delete function
[10:14:06] <j00bar> and again, i'm absolutely positive i can write it myself. i just don't see the point if it's already been written by somebody else. so what it sounds like is, no, nobody's written that widget.
[10:14:14] <djQuery> blorbx: $(this).hide()
[10:14:14] <j00bar> does anybody know what the name of such a UI element is?
[10:14:30] <felo> yes i think you will have to start something
[10:14:33] <blorbx> djQuery: wouldn't that just hide the link to the item and not the item?
[10:14:43] <felo> J00bar 20 minutes
[10:14:51] <felo> I don;t know of that
[10:14:53] <djQuery> j00bar: well thats just it its not a singular widget. its several widgets together
[10:15:07] <j00bar> djQuery: it all normalizes to a multi-select in the end.
[10:15:12] <djQuery> the box is an automplete widget
[10:15:41] <phishbot> having some trouble with complex deferreds o.O
[10:16:58] <djQuery> blorbx: $('.hidable').live('click', funciton(){  /*this= the individual div that was clicked.*/ $(this).hide();  })
[10:17:33] <djQuery> j00bar: hate multi selects
[10:17:54] <j00bar> not my favorite either.
[10:18:18] <rhymes> hi
[10:18:19] <djQuery> the user typicaly doesnt know to hold the shirt\ctrl to select multiples. I typicaly replace them with a series of <checkbox>
[10:18:32] <koesbong> blorbx: http://jsfiddle.net/rdkbJ/3/
[10:18:41] <djQuery> <input type="checkbox" /> rather
[10:19:37] <djQuery> blorbx: or even http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/rdkbJ/6/
[10:19:47] <marktuk2> !paste
[10:19:49] <djQuery> blorbx: see ?.toggle
[10:19:49] <bot-t> blorbx, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[10:19:55] <marktuk2> ?paste
[10:19:56] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[10:20:00] <marktuk2> cheers
[10:20:07] <marktuk2> whois marktuk
[10:20:13] <marktuk2> lol
[10:20:42] <koesbong> haha, nice "one-upped", djQuery  :P
[10:21:27] <rhymes> anyone got a minute?
[10:21:37] <blorbx> koesbong: i see, so i'd need to add an id to all the items?
[10:22:19] <blorbx> koesbong: it seems weird that i can't just have the link refer back specifically to the link when it's created
[10:22:26] <phishbot> anyone available who's worked with deferreds?
[10:22:35] <rhymes> im trying to track a bug here: http://bit.ly/lEc0UK  if you rollover where it says "categorias" the black scroller with brands will pop out of the container. Really weird behavior. Only happens on firefox
[10:23:20] <NoNoNo> phishbot: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/ http://iainjmitchell.com/blog/?p=496
[10:23:27] <blorbx> djQuery: do you think you could explain what is happening when i put the .click inside the loop? the behavior is completely unexpected to me
[10:23:38] <marktuk2> guys, i've got this code, http://jsfiddle.net/wYEwC/1/
[10:23:50] <marktuk2> it only seems to work if there's only one link on the page
[10:24:11] <marktuk2> using this plugin btw
[10:24:12] <marktuk2> http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/
[10:24:19] <phishbot> thanks NoNoNo, i've read the first link and understand the general concept. just can't figure out how to chain "then"
[10:24:31] <marktuk2> with one a.resource link on the page, it works, more than one, and it fails to ajax in the content
[10:24:52] <djQuery> blorbx: would never put a click inside a loop
[10:24:53] <NoNoNo> phishbot: sorry, I did not dig deeper into deferreds yet
[10:25:13] <djQuery> blorbx: see ?.delegate
[10:25:14] <bot-t> blorbx, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:26:11] <blorbx> djQuery: the reason i put it in the loop is because each click function is specifically referring back to a specific item
[10:26:33] <blorbx> djQuery: if i do the .click or .delegate outside of the loop, i will need some way of referring back to the item
[10:26:51] <blorbx> djQuery: which seems to necessitate the use of an id tag or something
[10:27:23] <djQuery> blorbx: jquery allways passes a var called this to your function
[10:27:40] <djQuery> you can allways refer back to the calling object as this
[10:28:28] <ZeuZ> http://pastebin.com/gYy93sye -> Firebug shows no error, the rest of the script works, but that. HTML seems not a problem since once I past it and run it through firebug, it'll just work. Any ideas? Of course this is on $(document).ready()... For a live test of the problem: http://190.16.98.253 click on REGISTRARSE down there
[10:28:32] <djQuery> blorbx: look over the examples we have give you and you might get it. if not its time to do some reading. see ?jqf
[10:28:33] <bot-t> blorbx, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[10:28:35] <blorbx> djQuery: but in this case, the <div> is the calling object right?
[10:28:41] <rhymes> i'm not sure where to start tracking for the problem
[10:28:48] <djQuery> blorbx: yes
[10:29:00] <jinxdone> rhymes, it seems to work fine for me
[10:29:20] <rhymes> but I do know that if the div that appears, doesn't cover the whole black scroller it works ok
[10:29:21] <blorbx> djQuery: so then to refer back to the item that the <div> is supposed to be linked to, i will need to use an id
[10:29:50] <rhymes> jinxdone: Are you on Firefox? It's really weird i have tested it on 3 computers, 2 will haves the same problem and 1 is working ok
[10:30:01] <jinxdone> yeah. ff 3.6x
[10:30:17] <djQuery> blorbx: well unless you use the psychic plugin it will need a way to know what item you are trying to hide etc....
[10:30:39] <rhymes> hmm we're testing on ff4.0.1
[10:31:12] <Stan_> Hi, I'm having some trouble with an ajax form.  Firebug shows that loading the remote page is timing out, but I can load the remote page in my browser just fine.  http://jsfiddle.net/E7stY/ and http://rosenthal.co/temp -- thanks
[10:31:35] <marktuk2> this only works with one link on the page http://jsfiddle.net/wYEwC/1/ is it because i had to do var rlink = $('a.resource'); ?
[10:32:05] <blorbx> djQuery: right, that's why i was thinking that doing the .click inside the loop allow you to have a different function() tailored to each specific item
[10:32:30] <blorbx> djQuery: but i am apparently missing something when it comes to iteration, because it acts completely weird
[10:33:08] <JonathanNeal> Is anyone here familiar with window.getSelection ?
[10:33:38] <djQuery> blorbx: well hmmm lets put the logic in a loop instead of inside the actual click, have fun
[10:33:57] <djQuery> blorbx: see ?.each
[10:33:58] <bot-t> blorbx, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[10:34:02] <swiggy> i have a weird issue... -> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/84W9q/ <- i have a select box, when you hit a button (well an <a> tag) take the current selected element, hide that element and then select the NEXT element (the element BELOW it) -- well my script is selecting the LAST element, not the NEXT - what gives?? and how do i fix??
[10:34:23] <swiggy> i have tried $('#useremails option:visible').attr('selected',true);    $('#useremails option).next(':visible').attr('selected',true);
[10:34:27] <swiggy> neither work
[10:35:06] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/84W9q/1/
[10:35:59] <swiggy> .next, .closest, .prev neither work :(
[10:36:05] <swiggy> they all go to the last element
[10:36:09] <felo> over here the  $(this).toggleClass('entered'); toggleClass will just trigger that class?
[10:36:24] <swiggy> the function thatdoes this is $('#addit').live('click',function()
[10:36:35] <felo> over here the  $(this).toggleClass('entered'); toggleClass will just trigger that class? ?
[10:36:40] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/84W9q/3/
[10:36:46] <swiggy> use that for your example
[10:36:50] <swiggy> or for a 'base'
[10:38:10] <djQuery> swiggy: $('#useremails option:selected').hide().next().prop('selected', true);
[10:38:14] <rhymes> Anyone else could repeat the error?
[10:39:23] <blorbx> djQuery: ok, so from the example that you and koesbong gave me, is there a way to refer back to the item other than using the div's html?
[10:39:23] <felo> hello the toggleClass will togle the content inside that class?
[10:39:46] <blorbx> djQuery: assign the div's id to be the same or something?
[10:40:10] <djQuery> blorbx: well 2 items cant have the same id
[10:40:29] <swiggy> not owrkin dj
[10:40:33] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/84W9q/4/
[10:40:39] <swiggy> did i do it right?
[10:40:53] <blorbx> djQuery: so then how would you normally link two objects like this
[10:41:18] <felo> I am getting a error saying $(document).ready is not a function
[10:41:21] <felo> that does that means?
[10:41:31] <felo> can anybody tell me
[10:41:37] <blindMoe> felo: do you have jquery loaded?
[10:41:46] <felo> I am using http://jsfiddle.net/WRAmB/
[10:41:54] <felo> do I have to load it up where?
[10:42:01] <felo> I am using jsfiddle

[10:42:07] <felo> in the firebug
[10:42:09] <felo> is tell me that
[10:42:44] <blindMoe> felo: on the left where it says "Mootools 1.3.2" .. switch it to jQuery
[10:42:49] <felo> does the toggleClass function needs some mootools or so?
[10:42:56] <felo> ok
[10:43:05] <felo> you mean in the firebug?>
[10:43:22] <blindMoe> arg

[10:45:06] <swiggy> it just sits

[10:50:14] <phlp> it also isnt working with 1.6
[10:50:20] <swiggy> 1.6?
[10:50:28] <swiggy> mannn
[10:50:32] <swiggy> i hate cross browser
[10:50:42] <swiggy> why cant there be a fn standard already!!!!!!
[10:50:45] <phlp> jQuery 1.6 i mean
[10:50:51] <swiggy> oh
[10:50:55] <swiggy> well we are using 1.4

[10:51:38] <swiggy> anyideas??
[10:52:33] <swiggy> its working fine for me in jQuery 1.4 w/ Firefox 4 and Firefox 6.01a
[10:52:41] <swiggy> but doesnt work with jquery 1.6
[10:53:54] <djQuery> swiggy: changes in attr in 1.6
[10:53:57] <phlp> it has to do with attr i think you have to do .attr('selected','selected') in 1.6 but i think it changed back in 1.6.1
[10:54:28] <djQuery> phlp: thin you need to do prop("selected", true);
[10:54:43] <swiggy> so your telling me
[10:54:48] <swiggy> when i upgrade from 1.4 -> 1.7
[10:54:49] <swiggy> 1.6
[10:54:56] <swiggy> i have to change all of my .attr tags?!?
[10:55:13] <djQuery> lol why not just remove them all then add them back in
[10:55:27] <swiggy> what?
[10:55:45] <phlp> swiggy: i think 1.6.1 should work the same, it was changed for 1.6 but people complained
[10:55:51] <djQuery> swiggy: remove all the options from the select, then add them back in
[10:56:01] <djQuery> just do .remove().appendTo()
[10:56:30] <swiggy> hrm
[10:56:35] <swiggy> but then
[10:56:37] <swiggy> it wont be in order
[10:56:44] <djQuery> remove().filter(":visible:enabled").appendTo("select");
[10:56:49] <swiggy> Adam L will be at the bottom
[10:56:50] <djQuery> sure it would
[10:57:00] <swiggy> if you use appendto?

[11:01:17] <swiggy> it continues to make input boxes, which can also be removed
[11:01:20] <swiggy> well wehn you 'remove' them

[11:01:32] <JSBracher> Help, I have a question: I'm trying to intercept a form submission, prevent the default action, and (for now) run an alert to make sure it's working.  But it's not.  The form is submitting anyway.  Here is what I have:

[11:02:37] <JSBracher> djQuery: thanks

[11:11:29] <charlie12> Hi All!
[11:12:10] <JSBracher> jsQuery - I'm dense this morning.  Still not making it work.
[11:12:10] <JSBracher> http://jsfiddle.net/jsbracher/n6C89/1/
[11:12:29] <charlie12> Anyone else think featured content sliders, are terribly overused? Any creative alternatives you have seen?
[11:12:49] <swiggy> is tehre an easy way to include a php db array, maybe a json object?
[11:12:50] <charlie12> Trying to think of something that spotlights content but not a content slider
[11:12:57] <charlie12> I am sick of them
[11:13:04] <swiggy> for the source
[11:13:25] <djQuery> JSBracher: holy shit you gota lotta crap there
[11:13:43] <sonotos> hi is this bug or feature that jQuery.datepicker.parseDate( 'yy-mm', '2011-01' ); throws an invalid date exception?
[11:14:18] <phlp> yyyy-mm ?
[11:14:27] <sonotos> no format is yy-mm
[11:14:28] <djQuery> JSBracher: thought of using see ?ui.tabs
[11:14:29] <bot-t> JSBracher, UI/API/1.8/Tabs - Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[11:14:53] <phlp> then why send it '2011-01' ?
[11:14:54] <sonotos> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/parseDate
[11:14:54] <JSBracher> djQuery: I'm new here. <shrug>
[11:15:13] <djQuery> JSBracher: take a look at it
[11:15:19] <sonotos> i'm only interested in the month, i've created a mpnthpicker
[11:15:20] <DanAKAHollywood> Anyone here read Smashing JQuery?
[11:15:28] <sonotos> monthpicker
[11:16:04] <JSBracher> Hm.... I didn't know about that.  I've only been using JQuery for about 2 weeks in the middle of a project, and my JS is sooo rusty....
[11:16:16] <PineappleClock> ever have a mootools guy come in to pick a fight
[11:16:24] <phlp> i would guess that what you are parsing has to match the format you give it. does '11-01' work?
[11:16:36] <sonotos> well it's not ready hard to create a workaround, i just wanted to ask if this is a bug or wanted behaviour, at least "2011-01" is no valid date
[11:16:36] <djQuery> JSBracher: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[11:16:37] <JEET> I am having a problem to load a cookie value after a function but if i use an alert after function and then try to load cookie value then I am able to load it but not with out the alert can any one help me? here is the link http://jsfiddle.net/96zYr/
[11:16:46] <JSBracher> I probably won't use the tabs on this project (we're past the deadline), but I'll keep it in mind for future projects.
[11:17:08] <djQuery> JSBracher: dont bother adding and removeing the noshow
[11:17:18] <djQuery> just add\remove the show
[11:17:34] <djQuery> JSBracher: give everything the noshow class
[11:17:57] <JSBracher> Yeah, I like tabs. I'll definitely keep that in mind.  Wish I knew about that 2 weeks ago.
[11:18:01] <djQuery> then in the show class just set {display: block}
[11:18:04] <sonotos> phlp: no the doku says: yy - year (four digit)
[11:18:18] <djQuery> JSBracher: see ?toggleClass
[11:18:18] <bot-t> JSBracher, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[11:18:19] <sonotos> it works with yy-mm-dd
[11:18:51] <phlp> sonotos: ok youre right sorry, havnt used it
[11:19:02] <Whirl3d> I have a script that sets the opacity of the body element to 0, loads all of it's pieces and hides all of the pieces, then once all are loaded, returns opacity of "body" to 1 and is supposed to fade in the pieces. However, when I set the body opacity back to 1, the pieces flash in and out once. I don't see how it's possible.
[11:19:06] <JSBracher> There are lots of code clean up things I'd like to do.  But... I was brought in when someone else quit, we're on deadline, and this project as evolved.  definitely a work in progress.
[11:19:20] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/ourfirm/index-4.html
[11:19:27] <sonotos> phlp: well in other libs the often have the yyyy format, was a valid try
[11:20:27] <djQuery> JSBracher: also you can do $("#introduction, #contactInformation, #etc....").removeClass("show");
[11:20:38] <JSBracher> djQuery: I appreciate the help, but if I can get the validation piece done, I might be able to get a project manager happy.
[11:20:41] <felo> i have a question
[11:20:51] <felo> http://www.nyhungry.com/jqueryform/formjquery.php?category_id=12
[11:20:57] <djQuery> JSBracher: see ?validation
[11:20:58] <bot-t> JSBracher, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[11:21:00] <felo> if you go there and click in one of the comment links
[11:21:06] <jeffsmykil> is there a really easy way to find the number of miliseconds between 1/1/1970 and a given date
[11:21:17] <felo> you will see it will slide toggle
[11:21:24] <Whirl3d> jeffsmykil, sounds like flash to me
[11:21:28] <felo> just for that comment
[11:21:30] <blorbx> if i saved a selection of elements to a variable, is there a way to access each one with an index?
[11:21:46] <jeffsmykil> Whirl3d: universal date whojamawhatsit
[11:22:00] <blorbx> like var things = $("#things div"); thing0 = things[0];
[11:22:13] <swiggy> autocomplete doesnt work on multiple items????  ie: $('input[id^="email"]').autocomplete({ });
[11:22:18] <JSBracher> I'm planning on using the validation plugin; but I have to do a few things before the form is submitted.  validate it, do some form field manipulation for the database...
[11:22:25] <swiggy> it is only working on the first element...
[11:22:25] <blorbx> or do i need to do thing0 = $("#things div:eq(0)");
[11:23:21] <phlp> blorbx: things.eq(0);
[11:23:25] <Whirl3d> jeffsmykil, why not use parse() on a date object?
[11:23:31] <JSBracher> another newbie question, when you type ?validation, where does that link to?  What does the ? stand for?
[11:24:10] <swiggy> djQuery, how do i get autocomplete to work on more than 1 element?
[11:24:20] <blorbx> phlp: thanks
[11:24:23] <swiggy> it does not work on elements that are dynamically created
[11:24:28] <jeffsmykil> whirled if you can point me to a tutorial
[11:24:57] <Whirl3d> jeffsmykil, http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parse.asp
[11:25:21] <phlp> swiggy: probably have to call .autocomplete again after you create the element
[11:25:36] <jeffsmykil> thanks Whirl3d ill look
[11:25:39] <djQuery> swiggy: $("#elm1, #elm2').autocomplte({optiosn});
[11:26:00] <ShawnRisk> I am getting this error: typeError result of expression '$ ' [undefined] is not a function when I try to install JQuery code.  Any ideas on how to fix in Drupal 7?  Maybe I am not loading JQuery before I load the page.
[11:26:06] <djQuery> JSBracher: see ?.preventDefault
[11:26:06] <bot-t> JSBracher, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:26:09] <swiggy> the element is dynamically created, so i am using $('input[id^="email"]').autocomplete(
[11:26:14] <swiggy> but it only works on the first matched
[11:27:14] <phlp> if they are created after that call then they wouldnt have been selected then, and it's not like .live
[11:27:48] <swiggy> right
[11:27:53] <swiggy> so how do i accomplish this?
[11:28:20] <phlp> call .autocomplete on the element after you create it
[11:28:43] <felo> http://jsfiddle.net/WRAmB/8/
[11:29:03] <felo> hi I have a question
[11:29:24] <djQuery> $("form").delegate('input[id^="email"]:not(autocompleted)', 'focus', function(){$(this).addClass('autocompleted').autocomplete({options});});
[11:29:32] <djQuery> swiggy: ^^^^^
[11:29:40] <swiggy> i got it to work
[11:29:41] <swiggy> oh
[11:29:41] <swiggy> well
[11:29:44] <swiggy> nice
[11:29:45] <felo> in order for me to generate a insert in the second form hwo can I approach that?
[11:29:46] <swiggy> i like that too
[11:29:51] <swiggy> i hate 'duplicate' code
[11:29:57] <swiggy> and would prefer to only have to call it 1 time
[11:30:10] <phlp> aka function
[11:30:21] <swiggy> so with what you just posted djq - that will work on newly created inputs too?
[11:30:36] <Zerxer> djQuery: :not(.autocompleted)
[11:31:14] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me
[11:31:35] <Zerxer> swiggy: it'll apply the autocomplete plugin to the inputs on hover, so yea
[11:31:40] <Zerxer> or rather on focus
[11:31:53] <swiggy> awesome
[11:32:01] <swiggy> i vote this channel for best channel of the year
[11:32:05] <Zerxer> but change that to :not(.autocompleted) as I said
[11:32:12] <Zerxer> since he's checking for a class
[11:32:29] <Zerxer> I'm sure autocomplete adds its own classnames to the inputs though that you could test for if you don't want to add your own
[11:32:45] <ShawnRisk> can anyone help with my problem?
[11:32:53] <jeffsmykil> Whirl3d: do i know have to serialize that number?
[11:32:56] <jeffsmykil> after the parse?
[11:32:58] <felo> This channel rocks
[11:33:17] <sanjayb> is there a jquery form method that acts like the opposite of .serializeArray() ? i.e. I give it a JSON object and it populates values in a form ?
[11:34:21] <Zerxer> ShawnRisk: yes you could be trying to use $ before jquery is loaded
[11:34:30] <Zerxer> or you could have noconflict activated
[11:34:34] <Zerxer> try using jQuery instead of $
[11:34:46] <felo> if I have two forms one to comment on the other posts how can I let the html and jquery knows which of the comments is being pick
[11:35:16] <felo> if I have two forms one to comment on the other posts how can I let the html and jquery knows which of the comments is being pick
[11:35:19] <lupo49> could i ask a question to datatables inhere?
[11:35:28] <djQuery> Zerxer: that was left in there to see who was payin attention
[11:35:29] <Zerxer> you could, perhaps
[11:35:31] <swiggy> $("form").delegate('input[id^="email"]:not(.autocompleted)', 'focus', function(){ $(this).addClass('autocompleted').autocomplete({ autoFocus:true, delay:160, source: emailarray }); });
[11:35:34] <swiggy> isnt working
[11:35:40] <felo> if I have two forms one to comment on the other posts how can I let the html and jquery knows which of the comments is being pick ?
[11:36:01] <Zerxer> djQuery: aha, ok now help swiggy some more ;)
[11:36:38] <swiggy> lol i think i got it
[11:36:45] <swiggy> my class isnt 'completed'
[11:36:46] <swiggy> its complete
[11:36:50] <swiggy> lemme see if it fixed
[11:36:53] <felo> .commentForm:first pick up tags ids?
[11:37:06] <Whirl3d> Okay, I just logged comments before my animation steps where I fade several items and they just aren't fading. I'm not getting any reference errors, it's just that they are completely ignoring me. Could someone please check it out. The code is simple-straightforward
[11:37:08] <swiggy> nope :*
[11:37:10] <swiggy> :'(
[11:37:24] <swiggy> $("form").delegate('input[id^="email"]:not(.autocomplete)', 'focus', function(){ $(this).addClass('autocomplete').autocomplete({ autoFocus:true, delay:160, source: emailarray }); });
[11:38:53] <ShawnRisk> Zerxer: that worked out for me

[11:42:29] <jeffsmykil> phlp: odd my top says nothing
[11:42:43] <djQuery> swiggy: why use multiple inputs? why not just use autocomple in multiple mode?

[11:54:34] <sarkis> above that i have var sample_feed = [{'foo':bar},{.....}]
[11:54:50] <sarkis> when i try to console.log(objs) i get null
[11:55:16] <ravenzz> http://jsonlint.com/
[11:55:19] <sarkis> is [{...},{...}] not proper json?
[11:55:24] <sarkis> ravenzz: thanks will try that
[11:56:38] <superjacaman> raver: you try with .live ?
[11:56:54] <jeffsmykil> aha it sees my message format as "raw"
[11:57:17] <jeffsmykil> i have it set to dataType
[11:57:27] <sarkis> ravenzz: says it is valid json.. hmm
[11:58:09] <ravenzz> i suppose that it should be a string..then you miss the quotes
[11:58:19] <ravenzz> var sample_feed = "[{'foo':bar},{.....}]"
[11:59:38] <raver> superjacaman, i can't change the bind to live
[11:59:55] <superjacaman> raver: why?
[12:00:02] <mrmccrac> phew, having problems using this jquery module and having a div start-out as collapsed versus expanded: http://www.darreningram.net/pages/examples/jQuery/CollapsiblePanelPlugin.aspx
[12:00:24] <raver> it's outputted by an intermediary class, which works with jquery, prototype and a few others
[12:00:29] <mrmccrac> trying to figure out what/if i can call slideToggle() on a div when the page loads
[12:01:31] <raver> however, i didn't knew about live, gonna see if i can workaround it somehow.. thanks :)
[12:01:39] <raver> so bind does not work for 'future' ids
[12:03:25] <Whirl3d> how do I override the default action for .fadeIn and .fadeOut since they are both busted and I am using them extensively?
[12:03:34] <superjacaman> raver: live is for this elements added with the jquery running
[12:04:04] <swiggy> wtf am i doing wrong.. this is such a noob Q i dont even want to ask.....                   var i = 1;   var next = (i+1);    return next;                    i am getting '11'.....
[12:04:42] <sic1> lol i is a string
[12:06:08] <raver> Thanks superjacaman works like a charm now :)
[12:06:35] <superjacaman> raver: nice =]
[12:06:45] <koesbong> raver: look into delegate too
[12:06:57] <timholum1> hello, I am having some issue's with jquery, From what I read  $("#" + sessID + ":CHATBODY" ).html("<div>DEMO</div>"); should be the same as document.getElementById(sessID + ":CHATBODY").innerHTML = "<div>Demo</div>";   but the document.getElementById works and the jquery one does not?
[12:06:59] <koesbong> i use delegate more than i do live
[12:07:06] <timholum1> can someone point me into what my issue is?
[12:07:24] <raver> blah, after 2 hours of trying to fix this, i'm happy with live, lol
[12:07:40] <koesbong> raver: fair enough  :)
[12:07:52] <swiggy> var id = $(this).attr('id');         id = id.replace('email','');        var next = (id+1);
[12:08:00] <swiggy> and im getting '11'....
[12:08:04] <swiggy> its supposed to be 2
[12:08:07] <swiggy> what a noob question
[12:08:14] <swiggy> i need lunch
[12:08:25] <phlp> timholum1: $("#" + sessID + "\\:CHATBODY" )
[12:08:40] <koesbong> swiggy - id is a string
[12:08:41] <sic1> swiggy: one of the 'numbers' is not a number
[12:08:53] <timholum1> phlp, Thank you, I have been working that issue for a few hours
[12:08:55] <sic1> there ya go
[12:09:34] <sic1> throw a parseInt( i, 10 ) on it and it will give u a 1
[12:09:48] <sic1> as in a number 1
[12:09:58] <koesbong> what sic1 said ^
[12:12:12] <yodacoder> how can i help contribute to the jquery project?
[12:12:18] <toot> hi - plugin scoping/model question if anyone can please :) http://jsfiddle.net/8Dpbc/ -- issue is how to call the plugin's method in the ajax success handler
[12:14:18] <eddiemonge> jqueryui question: how do i specify an option for a dialog's show method? I have {show: 'drop'} but I want to change the direction
[12:15:00] <littulb> How do I sync the values between two form elements with the same name??
[12:15:10] <matschaffer> toot: tried storing off `this` before $.ajax?
[12:15:48] <eddiemonge> littulb: $('input[name="namehere"]').val( whatever val you want )
[12:16:28] <toot> matschaffer - i believe so - however that's not to say i was doing it correctly. set a // var something = this; then called something.debug(result); something.fn.bob.debug(result), to no avail
[12:17:13] <matschaffer> it's be var that = this; $.ajax(… that.debug(result); )
[12:17:15] <toot> i think probably as i'm using the pattern used by the ui- folks using only 1 namespace which i assume is kinda like late binding - so not sure if the compiler would believe the debug method existed :D
[12:20:05] <matschaffer> toot: I've also seen people set up helper methods in the wrapper function as something of a private util space
[12:21:11] <Nicolas_Leonidas> will this find the next div that comes after this? $(this).find('div.videoImageBoxControlsCounter')
[12:21:17] <jeffsmykil> is there anything inherently wrong with this? var elementID = elementIDRaw.serialize();
[12:22:39] <matschaffer> jeffsmykil: elementIDRaw.serialize might be undefined. Depends on what elementIDRaw is
[12:23:30] <jeffsmykil> matschaffer: its a variable
[12:23:38] <eddiemonge> Nicolas_Leonidas: no. it will find a child of this that matches that selector. see ? next
[12:23:38] <bot-t> Nicolas_Leonidas, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[12:23:49] <matschaffer> Nicolas_Leonidas: depends on your definition of "next". What you have there finds children. .next() would find the next sibling.
[12:23:52] <toot> hmm actually moving the debug call outside and defining it as $.fn.bob.debug allows it to be called - so it is the 'late binding/evaluation'
[12:24:04] <matschaffer> jeffsmykil: I mean it depends on the value
[12:24:05] <toot> not sure of the 'clean' way to fix that then
[12:24:17] <jeffsmykil> its just 5 numbers matschaffer
[12:24:24] <matschaffer> so it's an array
[12:24:34] <jeffsmykil> no its a variable
[12:24:41] <littulb> eddiemonge... one of the elements is a clone. Say, if I change the value in the cloned input element, will that change the input in the original input element (that shares the same name)??
[12:24:45] <matschaffer> [1,2,3,4,5] right?
[12:25:12] <eddiemonge> littulb: depends on how you are changing the value. if you are typing in the box then no
[12:26:01] <Nicolas_Leonidas> matschaffer: so how do I find the next sibling div? $(this).next(div) ?
[12:26:16] <beriberikix> How do you enable CORS with .ajax()?
[12:26:55] <matschaffer> Nicolas_Leonidas: something like that anyway. .next("div") would just be the next div. Or tweak the selector as needed
[12:27:28] <Nicolas_Leonidas> like .next("div.classname") would find the next div that has classname = classname?
[12:27:30] <matschaffer> beriberikix: depends on browser, if you mean this https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control it's a server header that you need
[12:27:35] <matschaffer> Nicolas_Leonidas: should do it
[12:27:51] <Nicolas_Leonidas> sweet
[12:28:53] <beriberikix> matschaffer: ya, exactly. So I just add that to the header?
[12:29:11] <Nicolas_Leonidas> didn't work :( $(this).next('div.videoImageBoxControlsCounter')
[12:29:47] <matschaffer> Nicolas_Leonidas: either `this` or the selector is probably off
[12:29:54] <railslord> How to i loop over the attributes of an object?
[12:30:13] <dtach> Nicolas_Leonidas: why such a class name for the div?
[12:30:25] <SEJeff_work> How can you do logical OR in a selector?
[12:30:37] <matschaffer> beriberikix: so long as the server sends the correct header $.ajax should work fine (i think)
[12:30:46] <SEJeff_work> ie $(".ex4200 div").find(".module0 or .module1")
[12:30:55] <matschaffer> come to think of it I've only ever tried with a raw XMLHttpRequest, not $.ajax
[12:30:56] <dtach> though the length of it shouldnt matter :p
[12:31:03] <Nicolas_Leonidas> dtach: why not?
[12:31:18] <dtach> no nevermind thought there was a space in between
[12:31:27] <dtach> its just humongous so it got put on 2 lines here :P
[12:31:39] <Zerxer> SEJeff_work: so you only want module0 if it exists? module1 if not?
[12:31:56] <SEJeff_work> Zerxer, I want to select divs that have the module0 or module1 classes
[12:32:14] <Zerxer> do you mean a logical AND then
[12:32:15] <Zerxer> $(".ex4200 div").find('.module0, .module1')
[12:32:23] <SEJeff_work> Zerxer, Thanks!
[12:32:24] <beriberikix> matschaffer: When I try .ajax(), I get "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[12:32:25] <savid> Is there a way to tell if the page was loaded as a result of the user cycling back through their history?  For example, if the user hits the back button, I don't want certain JS code to re-execute.
[12:33:06] <matschaffer> beriberikix: what's the header value and document location?
[12:34:37] <beriberikix> matschaffer: Just testing against the Twitter api
[12:34:38] <beriberikix> Request URL:http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json
[12:34:38] <beriberikix> Request Headers
[12:34:38] <beriberikix> Accept:*/*
[12:34:38] <beriberikix> Origin:null
[12:34:38] <beriberikix> User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/534.24 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/11.0.696.71 Safari/534.24
[12:35:10] <matschaffer> beriberikix: it'd be in the response headers
[12:35:18] <matschaffer> and is the document location file:/// or something? that might not work
[12:39:14] <littulb> eddiemonge...yes its based on information thats typed in the input field
[12:40:42] <eddiemonge> littulb: if you clone an element, they do not maintain a connection to each other so you have to explicitlty create a function to copy the values to each other
[12:44:51] <littulb> eddiemonge... i wrote a small script. Can you look at it and tell me if this is the best way to do it http://jsfiddle.net/littulb/7AaXC/
[12:52:00] <matschaffer> littulb: seems reasonable. I'd usually give the nodes some id convention to make finding them a little simpler (e.g., my-input, my-input-clone). Couldn't say for sure which way is any faster. I just think it's a little more readable than :eq()
[12:55:07] <jeffsmykil> man i cannot get this json data formatted right for this webservice to work
[12:55:29] <jeffsmykil> im following the API
[12:55:31] <jeffsmykil> data: "elementID=elementID&startTime=startTime&endTime=endTime",
[12:57:03] <jeffsmykil> and data: {elementID : elementID, startTime : startTime, endTime : endTime},
[12:57:09] <jeffsmykil> nothing works then i can figure out
[12:58:47] <danheberden> jeffsmykil are you inspecting the data via dev tools on it's way out?
[12:58:53] <danheberden> just to make sure it looks right?
[12:59:04] <jeffsmykil> im using fiddler
[12:59:08] <jeffsmykil> and it looks like this
[12:59:18] <jeffsmykil> elementID=48955&startTime=989928000000&endTime=1100358000000
[12:59:32] <danheberden> is this an api on a server you're running?
[12:59:33] <danheberden> or a public api
[12:59:56] <jeffsmykil> the programmer told me it needs to look like this: {"field":Value,.....}
[13:00:01] <jeffsmykil> this is asp.net
[13:00:19] <danheberden> perhaps he meant a json string as variable
[13:00:31] <beriberikix> matschaffer: in 1.5.1 they added xhrFeilds
[13:00:36] <beriberikix> xhtFields*
[13:00:51] <beriberikix> crap, xhrFields
[13:00:55] <jeffsmykil> danheberden: could you elaborate?
[13:00:57] <danheberden> e.g. data: { whateverHeWanted: "{\"something\":\"value\"}" }
[13:01:24] <jeffsmykil>  "{\"something\":\"value\"}" looks familiar
[13:01:36] <danheberden> did he give you a data key to specify?
[13:02:13] <jeffsmykil> nope
[13:02:14] <danheberden> like data: { json: JSON.stringify( { js: "object", gets: "converted" } ) };
[13:02:41] <danheberden> which would result in data: '{"js":"object","gets":"converted"}'
[13:02:43] <jeffsmykil> danheberden: with this format:  "{\"something\":\"value\"}"
[13:02:49] <jeffsmykil> how do I string multiples?
[13:03:01] <danheberden> ?mdc JSON.stringify
[13:03:02] <bot-t> danheberden, Using native JSON - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_JSON_in_Firefox
[13:03:07] <danheberden> ?json2.js
[13:03:07] <bot-t> danheberden, jQuery.parseJSON - Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[13:03:10] <danheberden> hmph
[13:03:12] <danheberden> ?g json2.js
[13:03:13] <bot-t> danheberden, JSON in JavaScript - http://www.json.org/js.html
[13:03:35] <danheberden> the json2.js gives you a cross browser stringify function to convert an object to json
[13:04:43] <littulb> matschaffer... thanks bro - I would have used that same naming convention, however, the information thats being cloned is dynamically written using a CMS. My code clones the parent file (thus cloning all of the form elements). I'm also tryign to figure a way to automaticallly name the cloned elements.
[13:05:53] <danheberden> littulb instead of cloning, why not render a template?
[13:06:04] <danheberden> then you can create it just how you want, names 'n all
[13:06:06] <raver> superjacaman: still here? :)
[13:06:07] <jeffsmykil> danheberden: looks over my head but ill take a look
[13:06:25] <superjacaman> raver: hi i'm here
[13:07:01] <raver> the code works well when first selecting a value, but when selecting another one to get another set of records, it doesn't send the value anymore.. it sends the variable, but empty
[13:07:38] <eddiemonge> littulb: or do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/7AaXC/3/
[13:07:53] <raver> here is the version with live() http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1136399682
[13:08:32] <eddiemonge> raver: whitespace is all i gotta say for now
[13:08:53] <raver> :)
[13:10:00] <raver> doubt that empties the variable :)
[13:10:18] <raver> line 4 is the one that does it, ignore the rest
[13:10:31] <littulb> hahahahahaha eddiemonge.... YOU ARE THE MAANNNN!!!!!!!1
[13:11:55] <eddiemonge> raver: no, im saying that code is unreadable. whitespace is your friend when developing
[13:13:00] <raver> alright, here is just that line, with whitespace :) http://jsfiddle.net/2rP6K/
[13:13:02] <superjacaman> raver: first works second fails? right?
[13:13:30] <raver> first change works, second also works, it sends all the other values, but the value for state_location_id is empty
[13:14:20] <raver> but firebug says the value does not get removed in the html, so not sure why it's sending it empty
[13:15:07] <littulb> is there a way for jquery to tell where/what the origin of a cloned object is???
[13:15:17] <scrieler> hi, try to get the hight of a div, my problem is, this div get his input in a function before this, and I only get 0 because its still empty
[13:15:42] <eddiemonge> raver: are there multiple #location_state_id elements?
[13:15:50] <raver> no, just one
[13:15:51] <scrieler> how to start the function after the div is filled?
[13:15:55] <eddiemonge> littulb: you are cloning it so you should know what the origin is
[13:15:59] <SkiOne> I am having difficulty understanding what this line of code is doing: $('tbody th', table).each( function
[13:16:09] <SkiOne> its iterating over which part of the table?
[13:16:23] <superjacaman> raver: use console.log() to see with the serialize is working
[13:16:28] <eddiemonge> scrieler: get the height after the input is filled
[13:16:39] <superjacaman> if*
[13:17:02] <eddiemonge> SkiOne: in the element previously identified as table, for each th in the tbody, do this function
[13:17:35] <keenloop9> hi there, got a question: i am developing a phonegap + jquery mobile app. now it comes to the data storage. i have to query to some kind of local db. additinally i have to fetch some json data (just on refresh request) from a server and update my local db. i dont know which storage + library fits the best. any suggestions? thanks
[13:17:53] <raver> how do i do that?
[13:17:53] <SkiOne> eddiemonge:  thats what I thought, but there are no th's in the tbody, right? they would be in thead woudn't they?
[13:18:09] <raver> add console.log("%s: %o", msg, this); ?
[13:18:19] <SkiOne> keenloop9: use php and mysql and access it via ajax
[13:18:32] <scrieler> eddiemonge, thats what I am asking for, directionsDisplay.setDirections(response); newHeight(); <- setDirections fill it, but its filled after both functions are finished
[13:18:32] <littulb> lolol eddiemonge - I know where it is, but I want to know if there is a method/function/Plugin that will do that. The CMS automatically generates the form elements along with their names. I'm trying to write a general script that can tell the cloned element to sync with its "parent"
[13:18:35] <superjacaman> console.log($("#location_state_id").closest("form").serialize());
[13:18:39] <keenloop9> cant use php and mysql
[13:18:46] <eddiemonge> SkiOne: depends on the markup
[13:18:57] <superjacaman> after the ajax call
[13:18:57] <keenloop9> have to be something like sqlite or so.. =/
[13:19:11] <eddiemonge> scrieler: is setdirections an ajax call or something?
[13:19:17] <scrieler> google map
[13:19:38] <eddiemonge> littulb: not that i know of
[13:19:42] <SkiOne> eddiemonge: thanks you made it clear for me!
[13:19:55] <eddiemonge> littulb: not without setting some attribute on the original item that you can use to target it
[13:20:50] <raver> ok, found the problem, but not what's causing it
[13:20:56] <eddiemonge> keenloop9: not all mobile devices support sqlite atm i think. but maybe ask in #jquerymobile
[13:20:58] <raver> i added before, but the console helped
[13:21:09] <Escherial> hey, i have a div that appears when you hover over another element and disappears when you exit it, but i'd like to have the div remain visible if the user's mouse is within the div, too
[13:21:10] <raver> it sends it twice, once empty
[13:21:10] <raver> second call sends this: data[location_state_id]	5 data[location_state_id]	
[13:21:11] <raver> :/
[13:21:21] <Escherial> anyone happen to know an easy way to solve that problem? i imagine it's very common
[13:21:22] <eddiemonge> scrieler: then you have to do it in the callback
[13:21:42] <raver> i am a fraking idiot
[13:21:49] <superjacaman> why?
[13:21:52] <SkiOne> eddiemonge:  how do I .each over the first column only in a table?
[13:21:54] <raver> thanks guys
[13:22:02] <dtach> im loading elements with .load() and got .live('click', function() {} for them but they dont respond to the click, anything im forgetting?
[13:22:15] <raver> the second select had same name as first, i copoied it over and forgot to change
[13:22:17] <raver> damn damn damn
[13:22:32] <dtach> the click works on normal ones, but not on the new ones loaded
[13:22:39] <eddiemonge> raver: i asked you that lol
[13:22:41] <keenloop9> eddiemonge: done - but no answer. yes this could be a problem. i thought maybe i can just store the data in a json file. but.. which library should i use to do that...?
[13:22:48] <superjacaman> raver: happens more that u think
[13:22:51] <eddiemonge> raver: one small change http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/2rP6K/1/
[13:23:17] <eddiemonge> Escherial: the easiet way is to make the popup div a child of the hovering div
[13:23:25] <raver> i know eddie, and to be fair, there wasn't one in the actual form :)))
[13:23:37] <eddiemonge> SkiOne: first column? or first row?
[13:23:39] <keenloop9> eddiemonge: i am really new to the whole jquery stuff. is there some internal functionality in jquery which i can use to load und process json files?
[13:23:59] <eddiemonge> dtach: code? see ? pe
[13:24:00] <bot-t> dtach, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[13:24:31] <dtach> like i said the code works, just not the live part
[13:24:36] <eddiemonge> keenloop9: it will happen automatically with ajax calls who have a datatype of json
[13:24:40] <dtach> i mean it workso n the ones on the page already
[13:24:41] <Escherial> eddiemonge: ah, makes sense...what about if you can't make it a child of it? would it make sense to have a separate hover() handler for the popup div and have it set some flag so that the hover() handler for the hovering div doesn't hide the popup, perhaps?
[13:24:45] <eddiemonge> keenloop9: see ? get
[13:24:45] <bot-t> keenloop9, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[13:24:48] <dtach> loading more in with ajax, the click wont function
[13:25:00] <Escherial> eddiemonge: i'll probably go with making it a child, though; thanks :) makes positioning it much easier, too
[13:25:00] <eddiemonge> keenloop9: see ? $.get()
[13:25:01] <bot-t> keenloop9, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[13:25:02] <dtach>  $('.posterOverlay').live('click', function() { // do stuff });
[13:25:36] <eddiemonge> Escherial: you can append the div to the hover element on hover and then move it back on hover out
[13:25:40] <keenloop9> thanks you all. i will check this out and give it a try :)
[13:25:43] <sodhi> if I add a custom function to jQuery via $.extend, does it automatically have a callback as well, or do I need to - somehow - add that myself?
[13:25:53] <raver> thanks, changed to this :)
[13:25:58] <Escherial> eddiemonge: ah, brilliant :D
[13:26:12] <eddiemonge> dtach: no i mean post more of your code because based on that it should work
[13:26:28] <eddiemonge> sodhi: you have to add that yourself
[13:26:46] <Escherial> eddiemonge: i wonder if i should make the 'hovering div' an actual div, though; at the moment, it's an 'a' tag
[13:26:46] <dtach> ah
[13:26:52] <sodhi> eddiemonge: alright, thanks.
[13:28:18] <eddiemonge> Escherial: doesnt matter. as long as its a child and is connected "physically"
[13:28:22] <djQuery> JSBracher: see ?.map
[13:28:22] <bot-t> JSBracher, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[13:28:37] <Escherial> eddiemonge: awesome :) thank you again!
[13:29:06] <Escherial> i don't know why it never occurred to me to move the popup around in the dom to make these problems easier to handle
[13:29:10] <SkiOne> should this iterate through each tr inside tbody of table? $('tbody tr:eq(1)', table).each( function(i) {
[13:29:37] <eddiemonge> SkiOne: no, that will just get the second tr in the tbody
[13:29:56] <dtach> ok, here's pretty much my code for this http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/dPBaY/
[13:30:02] <ryrych> hi
[13:30:06] <SkiOne> eddiemonge: how would I do what I descibed then?
[13:30:15] <eddiemonge> SkiOne: drop the :eq(1) part
[13:30:17] <superjacaman> eddiemonge: u develop plugins too or just codes ?
[13:30:39] <eddiemonge> superjacaman: umm yes? i dont understand the question
[13:30:40] <ryrych> how can I get the index of an element in a matched set?
[13:30:51] <eddiemonge> ?index @ ryrych
[13:30:51] <bot-t> ryrych, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[13:30:52] <SkiOne> eddiemonge: wouldn't that select all the tds?
[13:31:08] <eddiemonge> SkiOne: no. that would only select the trs
[13:31:16] <ryrych> eddiemonge: haha, thanks :D
[13:31:20] <superjacaman> eddiemonge: i have a select custom code and i wanna organize this code in a plugin
[13:31:26] <SkiOne> right, so how would I select the first td in each tr?
[13:32:21] <Brodingo> eddiemonge killing it
[13:33:14] <eddiemonge> SkiOne:  $('tbody tr td:eq(0)', table) is one way
[13:33:51] <eddiemonge> SkiOne: $('tbody', table).find('tr').find('td:eq(0)') is another
[13:34:16] <eddiemonge> superjacaman: have you looked at see ? writing a plugin?
[13:34:17] <bot-t> superjacaman, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery offers a mechanism for adding in methods and functionality, bundled as plugins. Most of the methods and functions included in the default download are written using the jQuery plugin construct. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[13:34:47] <SkiOne> eddiemonge: so in this example $('tbody tr td:eq(0)', table).each( function(i) { i should equal the value of the current cell in column 1 right?
[13:34:50] <dtach> updated, more like http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/dPBaY/1/ when clicked it doesnt work but i assumed so i guess its something inside (due note that this code works (not the live one) as a normal click before)
[13:36:35] <eddiemonge> SkiOne: no, i will be the index of that current cell. see ? each
[13:36:35] <bot-t> SkiOne, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:36:59] <eddiemonge> dtach: you dont like indentation do you?
[13:37:05] <superjacaman> eddiemonge: will study this http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring i give up in first time kinda lazy
[13:37:25] <dtach> gives me freckles
[13:38:28] <dtach> woops forgot to set it to jQuery too *sigh*
[13:38:30] <eddiemonge> dtach: after you add more stuff to the page, specifically more of of the posterOverlay's, do console.log($('.posterOverlay').length)
[13:38:51] <dtach> okay
[13:39:38] <dtach> results in 24
[13:40:21] <MikeDepies> anyone here?
[13:40:32] <eddiemonge> dtach: also look at the changes i made here: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/dPBaY/2/
[13:41:50] <dtach> eddiemonge: ok give me a moment
[13:42:12] <eddiemonge> dtach: also, how are you suppose to click an element that is almost invisible? http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/dPBaY/4/
[13:42:28] <eddiemonge> MikeDepies: nope the room is completely empty
[13:42:51] <dtach> eddiemonge:  my bad :p i didnt add any css..
[13:43:58] <bittyx-laptop> hi all! say i have something like <a class="someClass" id="firstLink" href="#">Link</a> <---- how can i easily replace the <a> element with a <span> element, but keep all the attributes and contents? in this specific case, i'd like to get, for example: <span class="someClass" id="firstLink" href="#">Link</span>
[13:44:40] <eddiemonge> dtach: depending on whats getting added to the page, you might want to use delegate instead: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/dPBaY/5/  but if you do and li.poster 's are being added, you might want to start the selector to the first parent that isnt dynamic
[13:45:02] <eddiemonge> bittyx-laptop: thats not easy
[13:45:08] <dtach> eddiemonge: i'm clearly no jQuery/JS expert, i was having a lot of trouble making sure only 1 infopopup was open at a time so thanks for making it cleaner.
[13:45:22] <superjacaman> bittyx-laptop: it's not right...
[13:45:24] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: select that element and use .text() to get the text value and put it in a span ... see ?wrap
[13:45:25] <bot-t> bittyx-laptop, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[13:45:32] <sveimac> Any regex gurus who has a HTML comment regex for javascript that works with all kinds off whitespace :)?
[13:45:46] <ch3mical> Oh, you want the attributes as well?
[13:45:57] <sveimac> just html comments
[13:46:03] <dtach> eddiemonge: this is in a wordpress template so its picking it from the nextpage option and just getting the posts not the whole page (to leave fallback for non JS/spiders so on
[13:46:04] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: yeah, though now that i think about it, it doesn't make sense for a href attribute to be in a span element.
[13:46:52] <dtach> eddiemonge: sadly adding you code, it still wont work, no error on my page whatsoever. any ideas on how to bug track this (or whatever's the term)
[13:47:26] <eddiemonge> dtach: then you will need to find all infopopups, hide them and then show the one that should be shown
[13:47:29] <superjacaman> google is the best md5 decrypter ever
[13:47:39] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: do you know the attributes will always be there, or do you have to get any attribute that MIGHT exist in that anchor?
[13:48:11] <eddiemonge> dtach: link?
[13:48:12] <dtach> eddiemonge: it has display:none; in the css
[13:48:23] <papyromancer> I'm trying to run the same qunit test modules against a large number of pages.  I'm attempting to do this by switching iframe source and then running the tests, but everything tries to run at once.  has anyone solved a similar problem?
[13:48:31] <dtach> be okay if i PMed you it? it's a big work in progress
[13:48:36] <dtach> personal project
[13:48:37] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: well in this specific case, i know which attributes will be there, so i'll do something with .attr(), but i was wondering if there was a general purpose function that does this. obviously not, and for understandable reasons - generally, it doesn't make sense to do this anyway
[13:48:39] <dtach> and with big i mean a mess
[13:48:52] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: so it's a problem with my logic
[13:48:59] <eddiemonge> dtach: sure but i dont see why not post it in here in case others can help
[13:49:10] <dtach> just a little ashamed i guess
[13:51:29] <eddiemonge> dtach: update your jquery
[13:51:45] <dtach> huh?
[13:51:50] <dtach> the core file?
[13:51:51] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: ok
[13:52:08] <smarts> hi guys, I have a custom sorter for a dataTable column and when it sorts it pulls in the HTML from the initial DOM load, not the current DOM
[13:52:15] <smarts> it just has old data in it
[13:52:16] <eddiemonge> dtach yeah. 1.6.1
[13:52:30] <smarts> I have some JS that changes the dom on load, and when I click to sort the table the sorter has old data
[13:52:33] <smarts> any idea?
[13:53:14] <smarts> linky here: http://pastie.org/1973246
[13:53:27] <dtach> eddiemonge: done
[13:53:31] <smarts> the a and b variables are OL
[13:53:35] <smarts> according to Firefox
[13:53:39] <smarts> I mean  firebug
[13:53:48] <eddiemonge> dtach: is that code in a .ready() block? i cant tell
[13:53:55] <eddiemonge> oh nevermind, it doesnt have to be
[13:54:05] <dtach> dtach: sorry, yes it is
[13:54:17] <klusias> hello. i got array of chars ('A','A','B','C','A','B')..how can i sort them to get array out like this ('A'=>3,'B'=>2,'C'=>1) ?
[13:54:17] <dtach> there are 2 on the page right now, would that be a problem?
[13:54:23] <dtach> i mean one on the page, one in player.js
[13:54:41] <dtach> i mean $(document).ready(function(){}..
[13:55:25] <smarts> eddiemonge, any idea?
[13:55:56] <eddiemonge> dtach: yeah the problem is that code isnt firing
[13:55:58] <MagusOTB> Is it possible to use jquery-ui to make a buttonset without <label> elements?
[13:56:16] <littulb> ive seen "this" along with another selector ... example $("#foo" this).click() ... is that correct syntax???
[13:56:18] <eddiemonge> dtach: for fun, try changing the .poster to body
[13:56:24] <dtach> eddiemonge: hm but the panel (small leather tab) for exampe, is still working
[13:56:31] <MagusOTB> I can't use labels because they have to be for a unique element with an ID, and I'm writing a program that could possibly have multiple copies of the buttonset on the page.
[13:56:37] <dtach> eddiemonge: ok
[13:56:42] <eddiemonge> dtach i just pasted the code in the console and then they all work
[13:56:52] <dtach> hm
[13:57:03] <eddiemonge> dtach: and you can have multiple ready blocks.
[13:57:21] <eddiemonge> littulb: correct for what? and that example is not
[13:57:37] <scrieler> thanks eddiemonge for the tip, but I don't get it running =/ I don't know how to build a callback with this google snippet correctly http://pastebin.com/sKLsjN9h
[13:57:56] <MikeDepies> i'm having an issue with chrome and height
[13:58:05] <MikeDepies> height()*
[13:58:30] <eddiemonge> scrieler: i dont know what that is.
[13:59:05] <littulb> eddiemonge.. just saying that I've seen an instance where an id or class slector is coupled with the this selector - and wanted to know if that is possible
[13:59:34] <littulb> i cant remember where i saw it .... and apparently i didnt see the executed script
[14:00:07] <eddiemonge> littulb: are you trying to find a class that is a child of "this"?
[14:00:20] <scrieler> eddiemonge, sry, directionsDisplay.setDirections(response); puts the result into a div after submit, I only want to get this height after the input is filled in
[14:01:07] <eddiemonge> scrieler: you have to check then to see if setDirections has a callback. i dont know if it does or now
[14:01:29] <littulb> @ eddiemonge.... no
[14:02:00] <eddiemonge> littulb: then what are you trying to do?
[14:02:35] <dtach> eddiemonge: body didnt work
[14:03:03] <eddiemonge> dtach: try moving that code to its own script and own .ready block
[14:03:48] <dtach> sure thing
[14:03:52] <eddiemonge> and at some point you are going to have to add logic to stop the animations
[14:04:23] <dtach> afraid so
[14:04:34] <dtach> but for now, im just trying to get it all to work, then polish things up
[14:04:40] <MagusOTB> I'm not entirely sure why, but I'm trying to turn a checkbox into a button, and it keeps just disappearing.
[14:04:59] <MagusOTB> when I inspect the element, it shows the checkbox as having class="ui-helper-hidden"
[14:05:50] <OMGclay> fooling around with websockets, please play around a bit at http://www.typeofnan.com/chat.html
[14:06:46] <NackNick> can someone help me, im trying to remove a <a> tag on a link if its active im not entirely sure on how to begin to do this
[14:06:54] <dtach> eddiemonge: added it to its on ready, on the index still no result im afraid
[14:07:11] <dtach> nacknick why not disable it
[14:07:18] <dtach> if thats what youre trying to do at least
[14:07:26] <monokrome> Hey. Does anyone here know if there is a way to get a require.js-module-API version of jQuery?
[14:07:30] <NackNick> im trying to do it in retarded drupal
[14:07:34] <eddiemonge> dtach: change it back to .live
[14:07:49] <NackNick> i cant just put disable if on page unfortantly
[14:07:52] <monokrome> (without writing my own wrapper around it, which I'll do if not)
[14:07:53] <dtach> tried that from /4/ of your jsfiddle
[14:07:54] <BlackArts> Hi, I'm trying to send json data via ajax post method to mvc3 application, but nothing happens. I'm expecting to get redirected to the page I'm sending post.
[14:07:55] <eddiemonge> MagusOTB: using jqueryui?
[14:08:19] <dtach> NackNick: perhaps with http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[14:08:29] <BlackArts> here's my post request
[14:08:30] <BlackArts> $.ajax({ url: '@Url.Action("OrderScreen", "Browse")', data: JSON.stringify(cart_content), type: 'POST', contentType: 'application/json', dataType: 'json', success: function (result) { alert(result.ItemList[0].Str) } });
[14:08:39] <OMGclay> http://www.typeofnan.com/chat.html
[14:08:55] <eddiemonge> NackNick: set it to disabled in javascript or do a return false if a flag is set
[14:09:40] <eddiemonge> BlackArts: can you repeat the question in a different way please?
[14:10:19] <NackNick> its already wrapped
[14:11:12] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: Yes.
[14:12:09] <eddiemonge> MagusOTB: and youve followed http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#checkbox?
[14:12:54] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: Yes, but mine don
[14:13:02] <MagusOTB> 't have associated <label>s
[14:13:10] <MagusOTB> because they are not unique in the page, and don't have IDs
[14:13:38] <eddiemonge> that doesnt matter
[14:13:54] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: I've tried various arguments to button() including label:"text" and text:true and icons and such, but no matter what they just disappear
[14:14:44] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ MagusOTB
[14:14:44] <bot-t> MagusOTB, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[14:14:47] <eddiemonge> or a live link
[14:15:24] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: Just a sec, will make a jsfiddle.

[14:23:49] <necromancer> hi, i have the following code: https://gist.github.com/992018 and i'm getting a JSON response with data in it, but none of those callbacks get fired
[14:23:54] <phlp> systemfault: http://jquerylist.com
[14:24:15] <necromancer> i haven't worked with jsonp all that much...is there something else i need in the function definition for success?
[14:24:15] <systemfault> phlp: Thank you :)
[14:24:34] <ch3mical> Bunch of useless twats in #sql *sigh* .. sorry, just venting :/
[14:24:58] <eddiemonge> necromancer: what does the console say the status of the request is?

[14:25:59] <eddiemonge> djQuery: wtf?
[14:28:59] <dtach> eddiemonge: been trying to get this to work with the ajax added ones for an hour and a half now :( any ideas on what i could do to figure out whats going wrong

[14:31:47] <djQuery> systemfault: I have given up on you
[14:31:51] <djQuery> kiddin
[14:32:28] <necromancer> systemfault: i like facebox
[14:32:33] <necromancer> it's really easy to style
[14:32:36] <ShaunR> I do getJSON on a url and it returns a multi dimensional array, i also passed $(this).value() to to the getJSON params sent to the server, now i want to loop through the returned array but the key of htat array is the same value of $(this).value(), can i just do $.each(j.data[$(this).value()], function... ?
[14:32:39] <necromancer> and it works with HTML as well as images
[14:32:51] <necromancer> but its default style is also quite beautiful
[14:32:51] <eddiemonge> dtach: try taking out all the code and just use console.log("something") and then add in the code chunk by chunk
[14:32:53] <necromancer> there's also slimbox
[14:33:07] <eddiemonge> necromancer: add an error callback and see if that gets fired
[14:33:18] <dtach> eddiemonge: good idea
[14:33:51] <Nuckin> so I have these buttons that are mapped to the same click functions in different areas, im trying to onclick get a parent of the button depending on which button was clicked, but $(this).parent() would be like 6 parent() calls and if i changed the layout, the JS breaks, I tried $('div.class').children(this) but that returns multiple results
[14:34:37] <dtach> eddiemonge: nothing in the log on click
[14:34:38] <systemfault> necromancer: Lightbox isn't a good one?
[14:34:43] <systemfault> (I don't know, really)
[14:35:15] <necromancer> systemfault: that's the original iirc, but it was made for prototype/scriptaculous
[14:35:35] <systemfault> necromancer: facebox.. I'll look for that one.
[14:35:59] <necromancer> eddiemonge: errorThrown is "jQuery15104649246319840159_1306359331682 was not called"
[14:36:22] <phlp> Nuckin: what about $(this).closest('div.class') http://api.jquery.com/closest
[14:36:51] <necromancer> eddiemonge: statusText is "parsererror"
[14:37:02] <MagusOTB> is jsfiddle+jqueryui broken?
[14:37:13] <dtach> eddiemonge: i'm really dumbfound
[14:37:14] <MagusOTB> http://jsfiddle.net/uppCT/3/ Is a demo directly copypasted from the jqui page, and it's not working.
[14:37:18] <Nuckin> ph1p: interesting looking, thanks i'll try it!
[14:37:28] <MagusOTB> or am I doing something wrong?
[14:38:24] <systemfault> necromancer: last super question... works on IE7+?
[14:38:32] <necromancer> systemfault: yup
[14:38:36] <systemfault> Win.
[14:38:40] <necromancer> works on IE6+ iirc
[14:38:42] <eddiemonge> dtach: maybe do the same with the whole page?
[14:39:04] <eddiemonge> necromancer: are you trying to call this on a remote site?
[14:39:22] <necromancer> eddiemonge: i am
[14:39:23] <eddiemonge> MagusOTB: you have to add the CSS file to the resources
[14:40:03] <eddiemonge> necromancer: then you need to be doing jsonp
[14:40:05] <ShaunR> if $(this).val() was equal to 10, how could i do j.data.10 ... would i just do j.data.$(this).val() ?
[14:40:14] <necromancer> eddiemonge: it is jsonp. :)
[14:40:40] <eddiemonge> ShaunR: you want an index of 10? j.data[ $(this).val() ]
[14:40:53] <ShaunR> thanks
[14:40:56] <eddiemonge> necromancer: that example you showed didnt have jsonp anywhere
[14:41:02] <necromancer> eddiemonge: https://gist.github.com/992018
[14:41:08] <necromancer> dataType: 'jsonp'
[14:42:20] <eddiemonge> whats the response start with?
[14:42:34] <Whirl3d> Hey all, does anybody know of an easy way to find out where a line of text is going to wrap in a div?
[14:42:52] <necromancer> eddiemonge: ({. that's valid jsonp right?
[14:43:07] <necromancer> i removed the () and it validated on jsonlint
[14:43:13] <ShaunR> $.each how can i move on.. continue, next?
[14:43:17] <eddiemonge> necromancer: it should start with something like j({
[14:43:28] <danheberden> ShaunR just return
[14:43:34] <eddiemonge> basically whatever the callback part was
[14:43:47] <ShaunR> return will make it move onto the the next key in the loop?
[14:44:00] <danheberden> ShaunR you're just in a function that's getting called on each one
[14:44:09] <danheberden> so when you return or the function is done, it just moves on to the next one
[14:44:09] <necromancer> eddiemonge: the callback is "jQuery15108203033986117452_1306359394117", but that doesn't show up in the JSON response
[14:44:19] <eddiemonge> necromancer: it should. i think
[14:44:38] <phlp> unless you return false, then it stops the each
[14:44:41] <necromancer> eddiemonge: is that something that has to happen on the server side?
[14:44:44] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: Uhhh... Is there a CDN hosted jqui css I can use somewhere?
[14:45:08] <danheberden> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.13/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[14:45:12] <danheberden> list at code.jquery.com
[14:45:52] <danheberden> also google cdn hosts them, which you can see/get the links to at jquerui.com/download
[14:45:55] <eddiemonge> necromancer: yeah. the server should support jsonp otherwise you calling it with a jsonp will just make it laugh at you
[14:46:02] <danheberden> *jqueryui.com/download
[14:46:16] <necromancer> eddiemonge: it definitely does support jsonp. i'm talking about in the code of the file i'm requesting
[14:46:21] <eddiemonge> danheberden: you know you need to add the index.html to get the list right?
[14:46:36] <eddiemonge> we dont have it auto-indexed
[14:46:37] <danheberden> eddiemonge depends on the cache, then - works for me :(
[14:46:49] <Whirl3d> So nobody has ever had to deal with wrapping text correctly? I'm trying to avoid orphans for some inset text and it's proving to be a real pain.
[14:46:50] <danheberden> so yeah, code.jquery.com/index.html
[14:46:58] <necromancer> eddiemonge: i didn't make that file, but i know who did and i want to see if i have to tell them to change something. i'm trying to figure out if this is an issue on my end or the server end
[14:47:02] <eddiemonge> just another effin difference in the cdns
[14:48:26] <necromancer> eddiemonge: could this have to do with their code expecting "jsoncallback" to be defined with the callback? and if so, how do i load the jQuery callback into "jsoncallback=" rather than "callback="?
[14:48:39] <necromancer> i noticed that param somewhere on a testing server for this site
[14:49:20] <necromancer> eddiemonge: actually yes...when jsoncallback is defined the JSON has the callback prepended to it...
[14:49:37] <eddiemonge> honestly you lost me at some point
[14:50:09] <danheberden> url: "omg?jsoncallback=??"
[14:50:24] <danheberden> ?? will be replaced with "jquery123u1093413u491034_134141341431" or whatever
[14:50:52] <necromancer> danheberden: thank you
[14:51:25] <scrieler> eddiemonge, thanks for help, will try it tomorrow again :]
[14:51:31] <eddiemonge> danheberden: is such a showoff. just like coldhead
[14:51:48] <danheberden> i thought that was showgirl
[14:52:01] <coldhead> i thought shut up NO U
[14:53:17] <MagusOTB> http://jsfiddle.net/uppCT/4/ <- This is a demo of what I was talking about earlier about checkbox buttons disappearing.
[14:53:30] * danheberden loves coldhead
[14:55:25] <cuQa> hello. simple problem I guess. why doesnt this work when I set a variable and I want to calculate
[14:55:30] <necromancer> eddiemonge: thanks so much for your help dude.
[14:55:43] <MagusOTB> cuQa: What is 'this'?
[14:55:43] <necromancer> one more general question...what's the best way to iterate over an array within JSON?
[14:55:47] <cuQa> var $i = 1; $i = $i+1; doesnt work
[14:55:51] <necromancer> can i use $.each()?
[14:55:57] <cuQa> I tried like every shit and I dont get it
[14:56:26] <MagusOTB> cuQa: what do you expect it to do? set $i to 2?
[14:56:34] <eddiemonge> ?eval var $i = 1; $i = $i+1; $i
[14:56:34] <ElChapitan> any jquerymobile people out there?  Anyone have any idea where to start looking to solve this issue? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/alpha-4-iphone-viewport-not-resizing-after-orientation-change-virtual-events
[14:56:34] <Jon47> necromancer - json is just code which you can evaluate into a javascript object literal
[14:56:34] <bot-t> eddiemonge: 2
[14:56:40] <cuQa> nothing works. the best result is when I set a variable: var $i = '2'; and if I then calculate $i = $i+1; I get 21 lol
[14:56:45] <eddiemonge> looks like it works to me
[14:56:58] <cuQa> yes MagusOTB
[14:56:59] <MagusOTB> cuQa: that's because '2' is the string 2
[14:57:06] <necromancer> Jon47: so if i have a JSON array in var items, i can just do items.each?
[14:57:11] <eddiemonge> ElChapitan: check in #jquerymobile
[14:57:13] <necromancer> because it doesn't seem to be working for me
[14:57:15] <cuQa> ok, I thought that, but how can I set the string with an integer
[14:57:17] <Jon47> if you just have a JSON string, you need to eval it, but once it's an object literal you iterate through it like any object literal.. not using jquery but with native javascript
[14:57:17] <MagusOTB> cuQa: and + is string concatenation, so it casts 1 to a string and concatenates them.
[14:57:27] <eddiemonge> necromancer: just do a normal for loop
[14:57:27] <ElChapitan> eddiemonge, nobody answers over there, figured I'd try here
[14:57:32] <necromancer> ok
[14:57:42] <danheberden> cuQa in your string example, you need to cast the string as a number, then add
[14:57:43] <Jon47> for (i in obj) { console.log(i + ': ' + obj[i]}
[14:58:03] <danheberden> ?eval var i = "1"; i += +1; i;
[14:58:04] <bot-t> danheberden: "11"
[14:58:09] <danheberden> awww crap
[14:58:15] <danheberden> didn't cast i, haha
[14:58:27] <danheberden> ?eval var i = "1"; i = +i + 1; i;
[14:58:27] <bot-t> danheberden: 2
[14:58:55] <MagusOTB> wait, sticking a + in front of something casts it to int?
[14:59:01] <eddiemonge> ?eval var i = 1; i += 1; i;
[14:59:02] <bot-t> eddiemonge: 2
[14:59:06] <Jon47> is "+i" good form for casting, vs parseInt?
[14:59:11] <Jon47> its certainly more concise ;)
[14:59:16] <danheberden> ?eval +new Date();
[14:59:17] <bot-t> danheberden: 1306360747036
[14:59:19] <danheberden> MagusOTB ^
[14:59:34] <MagusOTB> That's awesome.
[14:59:56] <danheberden> ?eval +true + 2;
[14:59:56] <bot-t> danheberden: 3
[15:00:04] <MagusOTB> http://jsfiddle.net/uppCT/4/ <-- Anybody have any idea why these checkboxes are disappearing?
[15:00:21] <MagusOTB> ?eval var i=1.5; i = +i + 1; i
[15:00:21] <bot-t> MagusOTB: 2.5
[15:00:38] <cuQa> so minus ?eval I guess
[15:00:44] <cuQa> but it doesnt work for me
[15:00:54] <danheberden> cuQa something else is wrong then, cuz your first example
[15:00:55] <MagusOTB>  ?eval makes the bot do it in this channel, so yeah, don't actually use that
[15:00:56] <danheberden> was correct
[15:01:21] <danheberden> cuQa - why don't you make a small little test/sample with jsfiddle.net
[15:01:30] <danheberden> and see if you can reproduce it in a small little demo
[15:01:48] <danheberden> that'll probably show you the problem just doing that, but then we can help out further if you're still hitting a wall
[15:01:59] <dtach> eddiemonge: took out each block by block, no result :s
[15:03:18] <eddiemonge> dtach: were you using the cdn version of jquery or a local copy?
[15:03:29] <dtach> i updated to the CDN one
[15:03:52] <eddiemonge> MagusOTB: i guess the labels are required
[15:05:15] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: Drat. There's no way to go without them? That's kind of really lame
[15:05:32] <MagusOTB> What's the point of a label: option if I can't use it?
[15:05:38] * MagusOTB files a bugreport
[15:05:47] <eddiemonge> it allows you to overwrite the label
[15:06:14] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: I suppose, but I can't think of a way to get actual label properties here.
[15:06:27] <eddiemonge> MagusOTB: why not?
[15:06:43] <ngharo> anyone know how to split a string every two characters
[15:06:50] <MagusOTB> Because of the way my app is set up I can't think of a way to make each button have a unique ID
[15:06:51] <eddiemonge> dtach: i really dont know. its confusing. im at the limit of my free support options sadly
[15:07:01] <MagusOTB> it's part of a data entry form, and several of such forms can be open at the same time
[15:07:01] <dtach> eddiemonge:  after two hours i found what caused it :s theres a click iv added to the div where the posters are in that breaks theirs
[15:07:04] <ngharo> ?js "foobar".split(/.{2}/)
[15:07:05] <bot-t> ngharo: ["", "", "", ""]
[15:07:18] <ngharo> why doesnt that work :G
[15:07:28] <MagusOTB> unless it's possible to associate <label> elements with checkboxes without IDs.
[15:07:30] <dtach> eddiemonge: the click on the div they're in hides whatever is open
[15:07:38] <eddiemonge> dtach: ah. i guess breakpointing would have shown that
[15:07:57] <eddiemonge> MagusOTB: wrap the checkbox in a label
[15:07:58] <MagusOTB> like set them to CSS selectors or something.
[15:08:09] <dtach> leaves me with a new problem, how can i make that click on the div/background work with them
[15:08:23] <dtach> so the background with the holes you saw is #grid
[15:08:32] <eddiemonge> ?stoppropagation @ dtach
[15:08:32] <bot-t> dtach, event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[15:08:56] <dtach> i got that, though i might be mis-using it http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/zwXgB/
[15:09:26] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: How do you mean? I just tried sticking the input elements inside <label> elements and got an error "too much recursion"
[15:10:25] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/uppCT/6/ is what I tried.
[15:10:31] <danheberden> ngharo did you get an answer?
[15:10:40] <ngharo> nope
[15:10:46] <ngharo> any idea?
[15:10:55] <eddiemonge> dtach: that will just prevent the parents of div#grid from firing their click events. and there is no need of the div before the #. that actually slows things down
[15:10:58] <danheberden> yeah, not sure if split or match can do it, but
[15:11:03] <danheberden> ?eval var str = "foobari", i = 0, strSplit = []; for( ; i<str.length; i+=2 ) { strSplit.push( str.slice( i, i+2 ) ) }; strSplit;
[15:11:04] <bot-t> danheberden: ["fo", "ob", "ar", "i"]
[15:11:36] <ngharo> great, thanks!
[15:11:55] <dtach> eddiemonge: im confused now
[15:12:05] <eddiemonge> me too
[15:12:49] <cuQa> var i = "2"; i = +i +1; i;
[15:12:49] <cuQa> $('p').replaceWith(i);
[15:12:58] <cuQa> even that doesnt work in jsfiddle
[15:13:01] <eddiemonge> MagusOTB: i dont know. maybe ajpiano can provide some insight
[15:13:05] <danheberden> ngharo odd: "foobar".split( /(.{2})/ );
[15:13:16] <eddiemonge> cuQa: link?
[15:13:16] <cuQa> var i = "2"; i = +i +1; i;
[15:13:16] <cuQa> $('p').replaceWith(i);
[15:13:19] <cuQa> ups sorry
[15:13:21] <danheberden> ?eval "foobar".split( /(.{2})/ )
[15:13:22] <bot-t> danheberden: ["", "fo", "", "ob", "", "ar", ""]
[15:13:27] <cuQa> http://jsfiddle.net/b3q2K/3/
[15:13:45] <cuQa> http://jsfiddle.net/b3q2K/4/ now
[15:13:56] <phlp> ?js "foobar".match(/.{2}/g)
[15:13:57] <bot-t> phlp: ["fo", "ob", "ar"]
[15:14:44] <ngharo> ah, i dunno why i didnt think of match for this application
[15:14:48] <ngharo> awesomeness
[15:14:56] <MagusOTB> eddiemonge: Huh. Well, I've got to go to class. If I don't have any revelations, I'll probably be back in a couple hours.
[15:15:07] <phlp> ?js "foobari".match(/.{1,2}/g)
[15:15:08] <bot-t> phlp: ["fo", "ob", "ar", "i"]
[15:15:21] <danheberden> phlp oh nice catch on /g
[15:15:50] <eddiemonge> cuQa: why are you using replaceWith and not .text()?
[15:16:02] <cuQa> probably because I dont know better :<
[15:16:07] <danheberden> haha
[15:16:18] <eddiemonge> cuQa: im pretty sure replacewith is not what you want see ? replaceWith
[15:16:18] <bot-t> cuQa, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[15:16:27] <eddiemonge> ?text @ cuQa

[15:16:45] <JSM87> Hi guys, Im using jquery and jqueryui. datepicker works fine, however, if I open a jquery dialog box and try to open a datepicker from within that, it doesnt work. Any idea how I can get the two to work together?
[15:17:15] <cuQa> wow, the fuck
[15:17:24] <cuQa> it seemed to have something to do with replacewith
[15:17:29] <cuQa> now it works .. thx :/
[15:17:40] <eddiemonge> cuQa http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/b3q2K/6/
[15:17:52] <ngharo> phlp, danheberden - thanks a bunch
[15:18:06] <phlp> np :)
[15:18:06] <eddiemonge> cuQa: replaceWith is meant to replace one element with a different element. not replace text or content inside that element
[15:18:17] <Snerf> if I have a div where I .append() a new div which contains a new class (newclass) , $('.newclass').click(function() {} never seems to fire, is this because I used .append to add the new div?
[15:18:24] <dr_axiom> I am a newb to freenode, so i am sorry if I am asking in the wrong place... But I have a major IE bug. Can I ask here, or is there a better room?

[15:20:00] <danheberden> dr_axiom on some sites that's a feature
[15:20:10] <dr_axiom> haha.
[15:20:21] <eddiemonge> dr_axiom: that is pretty vague.
[15:20:44] <eddiemonge> and just out of curiosity, what prompted you to ask in #jquery?
[15:20:56] <dr_axiom> because I made the dropdown menu in jquery
[15:21:04] <dr_axiom> thought it is a css bug
[15:21:06] <dr_axiom> but i wasn't sure
[15:21:38] <dr_axiom> in my googles, i have seen "peekaboo bug" or a z-index bug
[15:21:40] <eddiemonge> ok now its becoming clearer.
[15:21:51] <dr_axiom> but none of the fixes they suggested helpped me

[15:28:16] <danheberden> heh
[15:28:22] <eddiemonge> joshua_george: was that a question?
[15:28:28] <joshua_george> yes
[15:28:30] <joshua_george> it was :P
[15:28:36] <eddiemonge> what was it?
[15:28:43] <joshua_george> new to html5
[15:28:54] <joshua_george> and wanna know how id take an animate a sequence of pngs

[15:29:14] <joshua_george> :P
[15:29:59] <danheberden> joshua_george you mean just make a slideshow of them?
[15:30:05] <danheberden> cuz there's plugins that do that
[15:30:05] <joshua_george> sorta
[15:30:10] <joshua_george> i mean more of an animation
[15:30:23] <eddiemonge> theres plugins for that
[15:30:25] <joshua_george> 30-60fps
[15:30:43] <eddiemonge> i think i missed the question again
[15:31:43] <danheberden> joshua_george maybe this will help: http://css-tricks.com/jquery-robot/
[15:32:07] <joshua_george> yeah i saw that dan
[15:32:12] <joshua_george> thats just tweening
[15:32:18] <danheberden> for a lot of pngs, it'd be best to have them as just one image
[15:32:19] <joshua_george> im looking more for changing frames

[15:33:29] <BlackArts> I have to send json
[15:33:41] <danheberden> then encode the json before you submit
[15:33:55] <BlackArts> how do I encode it?
[15:33:58] <danheberden> $('form').submit( function() { //make json, assign it to some hidden form element });
[15:34:25] <BlackArts> thanks

[15:34:42] <Snerf> danheberden eddiemonge , thanks, got it all working now
[15:34:43] <kamelkev> ok so I just created a fake account
[15:34:45] <kamelkev> and I received that invite
[15:34:47] <danheberden> then JSON.stringify it
[15:34:52] <kamelkev> but I am not receiving it for my proper username
[15:34:54] <kamelkev> not good :(
[15:34:59] <danheberden> kamelkev weird :/
[15:35:41] <eddiemonge> kamelkev: and youre sure the original request didnt go to your spam? or that you entered the email correctly originally?
[15:35:57] <danheberden> BlackArts or http://danheberden.com/jquery-plugin-serializeobject-2011-04-01/
[15:36:00] <kamelkev> when I ask it to send a reminder it doesn't give an error
[15:36:07] <kamelkev> so seemingly it's honoring it
[15:36:22] <kamelkev> do you know anyone who might be able to help
[15:36:50] <danheberden> unfortunately, mediawiki is a big bag of awfulness
[15:36:56] <danheberden> that doesn't give us a lot of flexibility :(
[15:37:12] <kamelkev> hmm
[15:37:18] <kamelkev> this is not very good
[15:37:22] <kamelkev> I have a nice color picker to give back
[15:37:30] <kamelkev> but I want it tagged with my proper username for obvious reasons
[15:37:41] <kamelkev> that's the entire reason I tried to create the account
[15:37:53] <danheberden> kamelkev is the username kamelkev
[15:38:09] <kamelkev> that's what I want to use, yes
[15:38:21] <eddiemonge> kamelkev: are you talking about this page? http://plugins.jquery.com/user/password
[15:38:22] <danheberden> lemme see if i can bump it up
[15:38:26] <kamelkev> thanks
[15:38:50] <eddiemonge> kamelkev: and have you seen this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[15:39:07] <kamelkev> there are quite a few color pickers out there
[15:39:10] <kamelkev> the one I made is tile based
[15:39:14] <kamelkev> instead of spectrum
[15:39:21] <kamelkev> you give it the colors you want end users to pick from
[15:39:25] <kamelkev> it's good for some things, not others
[15:39:47] <eddiemonge> the one i linked is the official or unofficially official or officially unofficial one. cant remember which
[15:40:36] <kamelkev> it's actually a dead project
[15:40:38] <eddiemonge> danheberden: want to bump my account up too?
[15:40:43] <eddiemonge> kamelkev: what is?
[15:40:51] <kamelkev> the git project you linked me to
[15:40:52] <kamelkev> is dead
[15:41:02] <eddiemonge> no its not. i can guarentee its not
[15:41:07] <kamelkev> uh

[15:41:15] <kamelkev> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[15:41:17] <kamelkev> try out any links there
[15:41:19] <kamelkev> all dead
[15:41:20] <JSM87> Hi im using datepicker. is it possible to display the year as two digits e.g 11 instead of 2011. Currently yy only displays it as 2011. tried y on its own but still 2011
[15:41:21] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[15:41:32] <kamelkev> been that way for a while
[15:41:44] <kamelkev> was this the attempt at the universal color picker?
[15:41:49] <kamelkev> I saw a very nice specification posted
[15:41:57] <kamelkev> nobody appears to have implemented it just yet
[15:42:06] <Whirl3d> anybody know of a way to bind to the hashchange event without bbq?
[15:42:35] <eddiemonge> kamelkev: look at the repo in that link i gave you
[15:42:40] <kamelkev> I did
[15:42:58] <kamelkev> I see people committing
[15:43:12] <eddiemonge> its very much not dead. unless gnarf is lying
[15:43:13] <kamelkev> but it's not the official version, it's been handed off by some people or something
[15:43:21] <kamelkev> wasn't ressig working on this at first
[15:43:30] <eddiemonge> yeah gnarf took over.
[15:43:47] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: without bbq? without ben_alman? what?
[15:45:15] <danheberden> kamelkev, it shows you're active?
[15:45:21] <eddiemonge> kamelkev:  http://blog.jquery.com/2011/04/16/official-plugins-a-change-in-the-roadmap/
[15:45:21] <kamelkev> sigh
[15:45:24] <erichynds> Whirl3d bbq just normalizes the event across browsers that don't support it natively.  you can just bind to the event, but without something like bbq, it's not going to work in IE7 et. al.

[15:51:28] <djQuery> what the heck am I doing wrong here. http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/X8tnE/1/
[15:52:10] <djQuery> need to get all innerHTML from all the .choosen li's and throw it in an array
[15:53:29] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/X8tnE/2/
[15:53:50] <danheberden> djQuery maybe cuz you're toggling "choosen" instead of "chosen"
[15:53:57] * danheberden is just guessing
[15:56:12] <djQuery> danheberden: errrmmm yeah but fixed that and its still not workin http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/X8tnE/4/
[15:56:53] <djQuery> got it

[15:58:07] <fostah> Hey does anyone know if its possible to alter the parent html,body scrollTop from an iframe on a different domain?
[15:58:32] <erichynds> possiblen't
[15:59:09] <fostah> basically I have an iframe on facebook and the anchor tags will not scroll to the id
[15:59:30] <danheberden> fostah nup
[15:59:58] <eddiemonge> djQuery: is this what you are trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/X8tnE/6/
[16:04:28] <djQuery> eddiemonge: if I was spelling stuff right got it now
[16:04:49] <eddiemonge> djQuery: what was the point of the array though since you were emptying it every time?
[16:06:04] <MistuhKurtz> Fostah it would be possible if you had control of both the iframe and the parent frame
[16:06:09] <dr_axiom> I am really at a loss with this IE bug. I cannot track it down
[16:06:37] <MistuhKurtz> what is it dr_axiom?
[16:06:40] <djQuery> eddiemonge: so that I dont have to remove the items from it. talkin them into not havingthe array sitting around anyway just move it to where they are actualy usin it
[16:07:04] <dr_axiom> Whenever I hover over my menu-system, the content of the site disappears
[16:07:26] <fostah> MistuhKurtz: thats the problem, its an iframe app on facebook that dynamically auto resizes the iframe to get rid of its scrollbars.
[16:07:32] <dr_axiom> in my searches i have found to try the fixes for "peekaboo bug" and "Holly Hack"
[16:07:35] <dr_axiom> but they didnt' work fo rme
[16:07:43] <eddiemonge> dr_axiom: you didnt provide any of the answers to my questions
[16:07:50] <dr_axiom> I didn't see them
[16:07:54] <dr_axiom> i got disconected
[16:08:21] <MistuhKurtz> dr_axiom do you have a link? is it an IE7 bug?
[16:08:38] <dr_axiom> http://redesign.buckinstitute.org
[16:08:43] <dr_axiom> I have only tried it in IE7
[16:08:52] <dr_axiom> and IE8
[16:08:59] <dr_axiom> and it is the same result

[16:10:46] <MistuhKurtz> where's the bug  thougH? i don't see anything wrong?
[16:10:53] <eddiemonge> dr_axiom: you do know you are including multiple jquery versions right?
[16:11:17] <eddiemonge> all old versions
[16:11:29] <dr_axiom> Whenever I hover over any of the top menu items in IE, the content disappears
[16:12:34] <dr_axiom> drupal requires a different version than the one i used for normal jquerying
[16:12:38] <eddiemonge> dr_axiom: look at your site in chrome and look at the console
[16:13:00] <eddiemonge> i hate how drupal makes people think that. it really doesnt.
[16:13:14] <dr_axiom> it forced me to apply an update
[16:13:17] <dr_axiom> and wouldn't work until i did
[16:13:32] <dr_axiom> what am i looking for in console?
[16:13:38] <eddiemonge> the errors
[16:13:50] <dr_axiom> ok
[16:13:56] <eddiemonge> the front end for your site has nothing to do with drupals backend management. effin drupal
[16:14:01] <Bartzy> Is there an equivilent of $(document).ready(), that fires when the HTML has finished loading (Like putting JS just before </html> ?) , or document.ready() is exactly that ?
[16:14:12] <eddiemonge> if you are going to use multiple jqueries, then you need to use noconflict
[16:14:27] <eddiemonge> Bartzy: thats pretty much what it is
[16:14:28] <dr_axiom> I don't need to, i will fix it eventually
[16:14:48] <RobDodson> hey guys
[16:14:50] <Bartzy> eddiemonge: And document.ready() will fire before images are loaded, blocking their loading ?
[16:15:07] <eddiemonge> ?ready @ Bartzy
[16:15:08] <bot-t> Bartzy, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[16:15:09] <MistuhKurtz> no it doesn't block image loading bartzy
[16:15:42] <Bartzy> So if I want to defer loading so the user can see the page faster - that's the way ?
[16:16:39] <RobDodson> I have a get request that I'm making with the get convenience method. It does a cross-domain request to a php file that I setup which just sends an email. Right now the request passes a dummy param of userId: 123. Whenever it fires the script does send the email, but I see an error in my firebug console for the get and the response it returns is "(an empty string)"
[16:16:45] <RobDodson> currently using jquery 1.4.2
[16:16:56] <RobDodson> any help is greatly appreciated
[16:17:00] <RobDodson> i suck at http :(
[16:17:04] <dr_axiom> HAHAHA
[16:17:06] <eddiemonge> Bartzy: what are you trying to do?
[16:17:18] <Bartzy> eddiemonge: Defer loading of JS ads
[16:17:19] <dr_axiom> it was the emulate ie7
[16:17:24] <dr_axiom> thanx for your help guys
[16:17:25] <Bartzy> JS-based ads.
[16:17:25] <MistuhKurtz> Bartzy check out YepNope.js
[16:17:37] <MistuhKurtz> ?g YepNope
[16:17:38] <bot-t> MistuhKurtz, yepnope.js | A Conditional Loader For Your Polyfills! - http://yepnopejs.com/
[16:17:38] <eddiemonge> ?sop @ RobDodson
[16:17:38] <bot-t> RobDodson, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[16:17:54] <dr_axiom> I will clean up my versions and fix teh console errors. Thanx again!
[16:18:02] <eddiemonge> Bartzy: that doesnt really answer the question
[16:18:07] <ch3mical> How do you check for shift/ctrl with a click event?
[16:19:21] <RobDodson> I guess what confuses me is that the email does get sent, which is the important part. I figured SOP would prevent the script from even running
[16:19:38] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: you dont?
[16:19:56] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: You can't?
[16:20:23] <MistuhKurtz> Bartzy, YepNope will load javascript files in parallel so they don't block the page loading. You could also do $(document).load(function(){ $.getScript('/path/to/some/script.js'); }); $(document).load() fires after everything has loaded, including images
[16:20:24] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1210547/javascript-detect-control-key-held-on-mouseup
[16:21:53] <ch3mical> Funny, I have an if statement to check if e.ctrlKey == true, but it's not catching it
[16:23:00] <Bartzy> MistuhKurtz: Cool. And YepNope will also wait after everything is loaded, or just do it in paralell ? I have one big (120KB) minifed JS file for my app. I do it to enjoy the benefits of browser caching on future pages (not the first one). The first page gets the performance hit because of that. YepNope will be better ? But if I use YepNope, only the necessary JS files will be loaded, and then the pages after the 1st one will also need t
[16:23:00] <Bartzy> o fetch JS files. With my solution (one big file), only the first page fetches the JS file - Everything else is from browser cache.
[16:23:25] <ch3mical> And now it is working
[16:23:31] <ch3mical> Must've been a typo
[16:23:34] <ch3mical> :)
[16:23:43] <RobDodson> can I use CORS to authorize the cross domain request?
[16:23:49] <MistuhKurtz> Bartzy, YepNope loads everything in parallel, so the JS file loading doesn't block the page rendering
[16:24:09] <RobDodson> i tried adding a header(Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *) but it didn't seem to show up in the response
[16:24:25] <__machine> trying to check the height of #left and #right... and increase the smaller one to match the bigger one... whats the easy way to code this? just if (left < right) { $(leftid).height(right) } else { $(rightid).height(left) } ?
[16:24:28] <Bartzy> MistuhKurtz: So a good solution for me would be to just load my big all-in-one JS file via YepNope ?
[16:24:59] <MistuhKurtz> If you want it to load without blocking the rest of the page
[16:25:16] <MistuhKurtz> There can be a brief moment before your javascript takes effect
[16:30:04] <Bartzy> MistuhKurtz: So if my page is based on that JS, I shouldn't do it ..
[16:30:05] <Bartzy> Thanks :)
[16:31:44] <MistuhKurtz> Yeah. If your JS is minimal and just used to enhance certain things then it can make everything load quicker
[16:33:06] <Assimilater> hi all, i'm really confused about something. Around february i downloaded jquery and in my code was using stuff like .attr('value') and the code worked, then i started using google's jquery and now .val() works. I rewrote the code never understanding the distinction or why .val() didn't work from what I downloaded and why .attr('value') was not working with google's. Now I'm finding that if i do .attr('checked') == 1 (old code that was work
[16:33:10] <Assimilater> can someone explain this to me?
[16:33:17] <Assimilater> what is the fundamental difference?
[16:34:43] <darki> hi
[16:35:25] <danheberden> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/03/jquery-16-released/ @ Assimilater
[16:35:41] <danheberden> check out under .prop(), .removeProp() and attr()
[16:35:56] <__machine> does .height() support += (increase) values?
[16:36:43] <Assimilater> thanks, will get to reading
[16:36:44] <Assimilater> brb
[16:38:03] <danheberden> __machine, no, but you can do .height( function(i,v) { return v + 9000; });
[16:39:14] <danheberden> though .css( 'height', "+=9000" ) would work too
[16:44:15] <Bartzy> jQuery BBQ by Ben Alman doesn't support jquery 1.6.1 ?
[16:44:27] <NackNick> has anyone ever had a problem with jquery throwing a black border around images and if so how can i fix it?
[16:44:36] <NackNick> my images are png format
[16:44:50] <NackNick> they work fine in firefox but in ie it looks horrib le
[16:46:24] <MistuhKurtz> you fading them NackNick?
[16:46:39] <NackNick> yeah with my slider
[16:46:50] <NackNick> its the weirdest thing
[16:46:57] <MistuhKurtz> and the transparent areas go black?
[16:47:02] <NackNick> yeah
[16:47:05] <MistuhKurtz> it's fixable.
[16:47:43] <NackNick> care to share on how i can fix it?
[16:47:45] <MistuhKurtz> hm i wonder if applying a background-color to the images would work? can you do that in your design?
[16:48:17] <MistuhKurtz> the same thing happens to TrueType text when you fade out a container with a transparent BG, if you give the container a bg color it works fine
[16:49:42] <NackNick> i can try it
[16:50:44] <Assimilater> does 0 no longer == false either?
[16:51:35] <NackNick> well...
[16:51:38] <NackNick> that fixed it
[16:51:40] <NackNick> but
[16:51:48] <NackNick> i cant use background none
[16:52:00] <NackNick> would a transparent image work?
[16:52:22] <Assimilater> i feel like i've learned stuff wrong :S
[16:52:25] <Assimilater> lo
[16:52:46] <Assimilater> oh...had to refresh the script haha
[16:52:46] <Assimilater> nvm
[16:58:17] <eddiemonge> Bartzy: you should ask ben_alman
[16:58:26] <willmarshall> Hey guys. I've got a strange issue with JQuery UI. $('#blah').sortable() is failing with "is not a function" - but Jquery UI seems to be successfully included according to Firebug and includes the sortable code
[16:58:37] <NackNick> a transparent image didnt work
[16:58:46] <NackNick> any suggestions?
[16:58:48] <Bartzy> ben_alman: Here by any chance ? BBQ is using toLowerCase and it's not supported by 1.6.1 ?
[17:02:55] <bittyx-laptop> Bartzy: what do you mean by, isn't supported by 1.6.1?
[17:03:09] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: link?
[17:03:19] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: It's not on a public server anywhere
[17:03:23] <bittyx-laptop> Bartzy: toLowerCase() is a native javascript function
[17:03:56] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: is jquery being included? is jqui coming after jq?
[17:04:07] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: are there any other console messages?
[17:04:27] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: JQuery is working, no other console messages, looks like JQUI is being included wrong in that case
[17:04:36] <willmarshall> It's being handled by a CMS, but I might have to patch it
[17:05:02] <bittyx-laptop> willmarshall: can you pastebin the relevant code? if nothing else, at least the resulting html output?
[17:06:46] <willmarshall> bittyx-laptop: Could do, but I think the issue must be inclusion order
[17:07:18] <willmarshall> Nope. Pasting now :)
[17:07:23] <bittyx-laptop> that shouldn't generally be a problem
[17:07:32] <willmarshall> bittyx-laptop: http://pastie.org/1973891
[17:07:34] <bittyx-laptop> and you'd know that (there'd be other symptoms)
[17:07:38] <willmarshall> It's nasty code, sorry
[17:08:30] <eddiemonge> bittyx-laptop: if they are included in the wrong order then that is a problem
[17:09:02] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: They're included in the right order
[17:09:05] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: sure, but i assume that'd be taken care of already
[17:09:16] <willmarshall> But I'm not seeing any of the JQuery-UI methods on anything
[17:09:33] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: i mean, that's something you'll notice, and there's bound to be other stuff failing as well
[17:10:28] <eddiemonge> bittyx-laptop: not if you dont call anything, or check the console.
[17:10:29] <bittyx-laptop> willmarshall: can you try include jqueryui from somewhere else?
[17:10:48] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: did you download jq and jqui or are you linking them from a CDN?
[17:10:49] <bittyx-laptop> s/include/including/
[17:10:59] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: he's hosting them himself
[17:11:05] <willmarshall> bittyx-laptop: Tricky. I'd have to fork the CMS, put it in my own repo, change my app to include that and generally muck about
[17:11:10] <willmarshall> They're on my server, yeah
[17:11:25] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: what cms?
[17:11:27] <bittyx-laptop> ugh, that's ugly
[17:11:29] <willmarshall> Refinery
[17:12:57] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: and its not using html5boilerplate?
[17:13:09] <willmarshall> I don't believe so
[17:13:26] <sphinxxx> are there any good jquery plugins for showing store locations on a map, preferably using custom icons on the map
[17:13:27] <eddiemonge> their site is
[17:13:41] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: In that case it's possible it is. What does this change?
[17:13:44] <strike> Hello, not a jQuery question but you guys so pro ..maybe you know: Is it possible to run a commandline program (via CMD.exe) in hidden mode, I mean you wouldn't see the CMD-window at all?
[17:14:29] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: nothing really. im just trying to figure stuff out. its kind of hard to troubleshoot this problem with a live link
[17:14:35] <willmarshall> Yeah :/
[17:14:54] <eddiemonge> strike: command line program on windows? eww. fun.
[17:15:13] <eddiemonge> strike: and stop trying to create virus and malware programs
[17:15:18] <strike> you don't know what I mean?
[17:15:28] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: PMed :)
[17:15:28] <strike> NEVER would make such malware sh** :SS
[17:16:16] <bittyx-laptop> willmarshall: when you said "failing", what exactly do you mean? is it failing when you try that from the console?
[17:16:16] <strike> I just want this one little program to run at background without disturbing window.
[17:16:27] <willmarshall> bittyx-laptop: Correct
[17:16:28] <bittyx-laptop> strike: that's off-topic here
[17:16:31] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: you are including two versions of jquery
[17:16:39] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: Aha. Hmm
[17:16:55] <willmarshall> I don't see the second
[17:16:57] <eddiemonge> strike: can you task scheduler it?
[17:17:04] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: rails.js
[17:17:29] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: Thanks dude!
[17:17:34] <willmarshall> Bug in the CMS I think, will patch :)
[17:17:39] <eddiemonge> and also, i dont see jqueryui
[17:17:43] <strike> eddiemonge yes I can and yes I have already. You'd say that task scheduler has such an option? I'll go recheck thanks. and sorry for offtopic.
[17:18:00] <bittyx-laptop> there's a jquery-ui-custom-min.js
[17:18:37] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: It's there ;)
[17:18:41] <eddiemonge> where?
[17:18:44] <bittyx-laptop> ah, so rails.js is also jquery? didn't know that
[17:18:57] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: bundled into jquery-plugins by the CMs in production mode, as I recall
[17:19:02] <willmarshall> I can see it on my local box just fine
[17:19:04] <eddiemonge> very first line of rails.js says jquery version 1.6.1
[17:19:10] <willmarshall> And the bug is fixed
[17:19:26] <gnarf> kamelkev: color is not dead ;)
[17:19:33] <bittyx-laptop> eddiemonge: and how would i know that? all i have is the html paste of his output, no direct link or anything
[17:19:37] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: its not that i would see
[17:19:41] <kamelkev> I see that
[17:19:42] <sphinxxx> php channel is full of uptight coders facing mid-life crisis'
[17:19:50] <kamelkev> you guys should update all the links so they point to your project
[17:19:55] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx: it always is
[17:20:04] <sphinxxx> i cant even ask a simple question
[17:20:05] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: bittyx-laptop  thanks guys
[17:20:06] <sphinxxx> lol
[17:20:19] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: yeah i definitely am not seeing jqui anywhere
[17:20:39] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: Check jquery-plugins.js
[17:20:47] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: not there
[17:20:53] <willmarshall> I can see it there in Firebug...
[17:21:04] <willmarshall> http://173.255.241.127/javascripts/cache/jquery.js?1304469868
[17:21:07] <eddiemonge> i see jcarousel in it
[17:21:25] <bittyx-laptop> sphinxxx: actually, you're asking an off-topic question there. for historical reasons, ##php is rather strict on topicness. but there's also #web and #phpc and tons of other channels where you can ask those questions
[17:21:28] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: thats jquery. not jquery ui
[17:21:41] <eddiemonge> oh, at the bottom
[17:21:57] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: Yeah. CMS is being magic about shit, but the bug was present on my local machine as well where it doesn't roll up the files
[17:22:05] <willmarshall> So should work when I deploy the fix
[17:22:20] <eddiemonge> that would explain the 161kb file. you really should use the cdn first though
[17:22:26] <sphinxxx> thx bittyx-laptop , i mean it is like a php-mysql question, i didn't think they would be so crazy about it
[17:22:49] <kulu> hello Guys!
[17:22:53] <kulu> Need 1 help !
[17:22:54] <willmarshall> eddiemonge: Like I say, it's a CMS, I don't have control over that short of forking it or submitting a patch
[17:22:59] <eddiemonge> gnarf: why did you kill color without telling me? stealing my make info and then killing the project. pssh!
[17:23:22] <kulu> http://arborjs.org/ <--- want to make a website with menu like it (in the link)
[17:23:23] <eddiemonge> willmarshall: um that would be defined in your local files
[17:23:28] <kulu> Where shall I start ?
[17:23:33] <eddiemonge> kulu: view source?
[17:23:55] <kulu> eddiemonge :) thats the first thinf I did
[17:24:10] <kulu> Its complicated than it seems :)
[17:24:23] <eddiemonge> its cool but its not entirely user friendly
[17:24:26] <kulu> I also downloaded the jquery of it
[17:24:51] <MistuhKurtz> yeah kulu that thing is awful for user friendliness
[17:25:05] <kulu> I know its kool! But I thought It was easily achievable and I showed it to my client and he is now mad after it!
[17:25:18] <MistuhKurtz> i hover over a button that i want to click and it jerks away, pissing me off in the process
[17:25:20] <kulu> I asked him for other options bt he is more keen for this!
[17:25:33] <MistuhKurtz> why would you show your client something like this! ahhhhh
[17:25:39] <bittyx-laptop> kulu: ouch. yeah, it looks cool, but it's awful for actual use.
[17:25:49] <kulu> because his logo is similar to it
[17:26:06] <kulu> and the concept behing it seems creative! if executed well
[17:26:10] <kulu> *behind
[17:26:49] <eddiemonge> why in the world would you think its easily achievable?
[17:27:32] <kulu> coz I thought its just a jquery to realize later (after showing to client) That its Bloody HTML5 with canvas and it deals with database!
[17:27:49] <eddiemonge> kulu do you know what jquery is?
[17:27:50] <kulu> Thats the stupidest mistake I have ever made
[17:28:11] <kulu> not as much as you know eddiemonge
[17:28:44] <eddiemonge> you keep saying things like "its just a jquery" and "downloaded the jquery of it", just makes me question things
[17:28:48] <bittyx-laptop> kulu: "It leaves the actual screen-drawing to you. This means you can use it with canvas, SVG, or even positioned HTML elements; whatever display approach is appropriate for your project and your performance needs."
[17:29:56] <kulu> I think I'll go with the positioned HTML
[17:30:19] <bittyx-laptop> kulu: it's not that complicated: https://github.com/samizdatco/arbor/tree/master/docs/sample-project
[17:31:00] <kulu> bittyx-laptop I downloaded that
[17:31:14] <kulu> but I dont know how to get the submenu work with it
[17:36:47] <kulu> hmmm
[17:40:00] <kulu> anyways Thanks for the talk eddiemonge and bittyx-laptop :)
[17:40:18] <kulu> will try and find some other way to sort it out!
[17:40:33] <kulu> bye :)
[17:41:26] <wesada> Hi all.
[17:41:46] <wesada> Question about $.ajax()
[17:44:32] <MistuhKurtz> shoot wesada
[17:44:35] <wesada> I'm trying to send a custom header with $.ajax(type:'POST', url:'example.com/uri.php', data:{mydata:'Example'}, headers:{'X-Example-Header':'Custom header info'}});
[17:44:56] <wesada> But in Firefox the custom headers are not sent
[17:46:30] <MistuhKurtz> uhm
[17:46:42] <MistuhKurtz> you're on the same domain right?
[17:46:59] <wesada> MistuhKurtz: Yep.
[17:47:38] <MistuhKurtz> okay then
[17:47:51] <MistuhKurtz> yeah i've never tried to send custom headers sooo good luck
[17:47:56] <MistuhKurtz> :D
[17:48:37] <wesada> MistuhKurtz: Thank you though.  I figure the collective knowledge of IRC should help me to solve it. :) So I appreciate it.
[17:49:26] <MistuhKurtz> sure np, hope it doesn't plague you for too long
[17:51:14] <mlins> Does jQuery only consider AJAX responses with data a 'success' even if the status code is 20x?
[17:52:12] <mlins> I'm asking because on my 'destroy' action, I'm not returning any data - only the 200 status code and jQuery doesn't seem to think it's successful.
[17:53:19] <mlins> I'm not very familiar with the jQuery codebase, but this is what it looks like to me, can anyone confirm?
[17:53:20] <mlins> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L518
[17:53:44] <djQuery> ?.map
[17:53:44] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[17:54:59] <djQuery> ?.contains
[17:54:59] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[17:57:28] <wesada> My understanding of the headers map in $.ajax() is that I don't have set beforeSend explicitly to pass custom headers.
[17:57:37] <wesada> ?.ajax
[17:57:38] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:59:20] <wesada> I should just be able to pass headers:{'X-Custom-Header-1':'Value1', 'X-Custom-Header-2':'Value2'}
[17:59:46] <wesada> At least according to the current docs as is my understanding of them.
[18:01:23] <lbiffin> How might I detect when an element's attribute has been changed? Is there an event for this?
[18:03:07] <bittyx-laptop> wesada:
[18:04:34] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: hey, i've just opened up the firebug console in a site i'm currently working on. the site has jquery 1.6.1 included. i've typed $.ajax('localhost/dev/null', { headers: {'X-Example-Header':'BLABLABLA'}}); and i can see in the Net panel that the header was correctly included
[18:06:56] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: Interesting I'll have to try that.
[18:06:59] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: also, the exact same line you've pasted here for the $.ajax call
[18:07:10] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: you're just missing a { opening bracket there
[18:07:19] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: you want $.ajax({ type : ....
[18:07:29] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: you've pasted $.ajax( type : ...
[18:07:53] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: i assume it was a typo or something. anyway, just wanted to tell you it works for me, at least. might help you debug
[18:07:53] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: Thanks. I'm IRCing on a Netbook
[18:08:11] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: Fat fingers no dialing want.
[18:08:23] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: Haha wand.
[18:08:55] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: fwiw, i'm using ff4.0.1, with jquery 1.6.1 and jqueryui 1.8.13 being included on that page.
[18:09:23] <bittyx-laptop> yeah, i'm IRCing on my laptop, but my fingers are also used to a regular keyboard
[18:09:31] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: I appreciate the help. I'm using all the latest myself.
[18:10:02] <bittyx-laptop> to make things worse, i regularly alternate between the laptop and the pc, and it takes me twice the time to type anything on the small keyboard xD
[18:10:15] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: I'm trying to pass a custom header for a CSRF token.
[18:10:33] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: no problem. just thought i'd mention that it doesn't seem to be a problem with jquery.
[18:10:47] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: is the rest of the request sent correctly? e.g. POST data, etc?
[18:12:43] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: All seems to be well with the data.  The XHR data does post correctly according to Firebug but the headers are not being set.
[18:14:17] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: that's weird. have you got an example page online?
[18:15:25] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: Unfortunately I don't.
[18:24:19] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: This is definitely a head scratcher.
[18:29:31] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: are you maybe using some firefox plugins that are, for some reason, preventing the header being included?
[18:30:25] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: also, can you pastebin the js code you're calling the POST with, and the complete request header that gets sent?
[18:37:45] <bittyx-laptop> wesada: can't do much more research, but there are ff plugins like Modify Headers, which, well, do exactly that. check that you don't have some sort of auto-header-filtering set up. that's as far as my ideas go, since it's 3:30am here, and i've gotta go to sleep so i can at least resemble a functional person tomorrow. so, good night, good luck and see ya!
[18:52:43] <wesada> bittyx-laptop: So I've checked the XHR request in Chrome Dev Tools too and still no custom headers.
[19:02:01] <abjorn> allo
[19:02:26] <Draconisle> hi guys
[19:02:46] <Draconisle> just wondering how to have pins on a map ignore each other
[19:02:53] <Draconisle> positioning seems to be tricky for me
[19:02:55] <Draconisle> i
[19:03:03] <abjorn> what?
[19:03:07] <Draconisle> i've tried inline and block and they are off
[19:03:17] <abjorn> pins on a map?
[19:03:38] <Draconisle> just positioning anchors with a background image
[19:03:44] <Draconisle> i need them to ignore each other
[19:03:55] <Draconisle> so that I get absolute positioning within that container
[19:04:25] <Draconisle> so that if I set all of them with top 25 and left 50, all of them will be on top of each other
[19:04:33] <abjorn> well, you should probably take this to #css
[19:04:50] <Draconisle> ok thanks
[19:05:08] <abjorn> but it sounds like you should use position: absolute then
[19:05:28] <Draconisle> when I do, it goes to the dom
[19:05:35] <Draconisle> which I dont want
[19:05:44] <abjorn> wut
[19:06:13] <Draconisle> its a map so there are several divs on it
[19:06:22] <Kocho> hey everyone, im trying to make one of those sticky jquery nav's... mine keeps on going to the top and im not sure why.. any ideas? http://ckgd.net/2011/index1.php
[19:06:53] <Draconisle> i'll just google some more, its a jquery channel anyway
[19:07:05] <abjorn> Well, Draconisle, make sure the parent has a position property of something other than the default (static)
[19:07:37] <Draconisle> ok, i will try that
[19:08:57] <nathanaelphilip> Does anyone know how to execute a <script> in a php file with an $.ajax call?
[19:09:07] <nathanaelphilip> and return the rendered html?
[19:09:11] <nathanaelphilip> i know how to call/fetch
[19:09:19] <nathanaelphilip> but it's returning the <script>, not the html
[19:10:48] <Anitox> onload?
[19:10:58] <nathanaelphilip> no
[19:11:02] <nathanaelphilip> via an Ajax call
[19:11:08] <Anitox> onload on your new script tag...
[19:11:33] <nathanaelphilip> http://pastie.org/1974268
[19:11:38] <nathanaelphilip> http://pastie.org/1974268
[19:11:54] <nathanaelphilip> a
[19:12:09] <nathanaelphilip> pastie.org/1974268
[19:12:21] <Anitox> make sure you post that at least 6 times
[19:12:27] <Anitox> cause some people might not get it
[19:12:28] <nathanaelphilip> it's not showing for me
[19:12:51] <nathanaelphilip> weird
[19:12:52] <Kocho> any ideas?
[19:12:59] <abjorn> lol anitox
[19:13:01] <Anitox> what is videoID?
[19:13:33] <nathanaelphilip> @Kocho, you want position:fixed;
[19:13:36] <nathanaelphilip> not absolute
[19:13:42] <nathanaelphilip> video ID, is passed to the script
[19:13:56] <nathanaelphilip> i can successfully contact the process.php file, and return the data
[19:14:09] <nathanaelphilip> but it returns the <script>, not the executed script
[19:14:25] <abjorn> No I don't think he wants position: fixed;
[19:14:39] <abjorn> At least that's not what it sounds like
[19:14:53] <nathanaelphilip> he said “sticky”
[19:14:57] <Anitox> so, you return a <script> which you should append?
[19:15:15] <abjorn> idk he didn't describe just what he was doing too well lol
[19:15:20] <Anitox> but when it loads, you want it to do something, so you should use onload?
[19:15:32] <nathanaelphilip> in the processing.php file?
[19:15:43] <Anitox> yeah, i want magical things to happen
[19:15:47] <Kocho> nathanaelphilip: that's how i want it but when i scroll back up to the top i want it back in it's original position: http://ckgd.net/2011/index1.php
[19:15:51] <Kocho> (just refresh)
[19:16:19] <nathanaelphilip> @kocko, you  need to detect the distance from the top of the window
[19:16:31] <nathanaelphilip> then say “oh hai, it's passed 100px, I need the navigation to now stick”
[19:17:07] <nathanaelphilip> @kocho, but the way you're doing it
[19:17:11] <nathanaelphilip> just have it fixed from the start
[19:18:11] <nathanaelphilip> i don't think you need any fancy jQuery
[19:18:17] <nathanaelphilip> @Anitox, so that's a no?
[19:19:03] <Anitox> ?
[19:19:24] <Anitox> you want to scroll to a certain location in a page?
[19:19:25] <nathanaelphilip> n/m
[19:19:30] <nathanaelphilip> i misread that
[19:26:29] <ch3mical> Does jQuery.hasData() even work?
[19:27:01] <ch3mical> I'm sitting here doing $(element).data('test','test') and then doing $.hasData(element) and it says false every time
[19:28:09] <nathanaelphilip> are you passing an object or an element to it?
[19:28:16] <nathanaelphilip> $('p') or just p?
[19:30:37] <ch3mical> Element... I just figured it out though... you have to put [0] behind your jquery selector
[19:30:49] <ch3mical> $.hasData($(element)[0])
[19:30:53] <ch3mical> T_T
[19:31:08] <ajpiano> a jquery object isn't an element.
[19:31:30] <ch3mical> Well I'm just going by the example on api.jquery.com
[19:31:40] <ch3mical> see ?jquery.hasdata
[19:31:43] <bot-t> ch3mical, jQuery.hasData() - Determine whether an element has any jQuery data associated with it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.hasData/
[19:32:03] <ajpiano> which uses an element, not a jquery object.
[19:32:04] <ch3mical> It sets a var as a jquery object then resets the var as the var[0]
[19:32:18] <ch3mical> I just hadn't noticed the second part at first
[19:32:23] <ajpiano> ah
[19:33:03] <ch3mical> When you do $(element)[0] that's considered an element?
[19:33:08] <ch3mical> Or an object?
[19:33:51] <ajpiano> ch3mical, a jquery object is an instance of jQuery that contains an array of actual DOM Elements
[19:33:53] <Draconisle> i think that would be the first object
[19:33:59] <ch3mical> Seems like I have to do it that way because I had tried just using a selector in hasdata but that wasn't working either
[19:34:13] <ajpiano> and as the docs say, you have to pass an actual DOM Element to jQuery.hasData
[19:34:18] <ch3mical> Right
[19:34:58] <Draconisle> http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[19:35:24] <ch3mical> There's only one object, Draconisle. I'm selecting it by ID
[19:35:39] <ajpiano> it still is an array with a single element inside of it
[19:35:42] <Brodingo> my sperm hasData
[19:36:45] <ch3mical> WTF, now it's just returning true no matter what
[19:36:49] <Brodingo> roboidentity issues
[19:37:09] <ch3mical> ajpiano: but the "first" selector won't change that, right?
[19:37:13] <ajpiano> no.
[19:37:18] <ch3mical> Exactly my point
[19:37:19] <ajpiano> .get(0) or [0] will
[19:37:36] <ch3mical> Anyway, now hasdata is returning true always
[19:37:41] <heshanh> how do i remove all the whitespce and /n stuff from a string that i get from .text()
[19:37:53] <panfist> what's the appropriate pattern to use when you are trying to ajax a list of things with a long time in between items, if you want to show them to the user as they finish
[19:38:04] <heshanh> im trying to get 3 id's but i get ["\n YgFyi74DVjc,t5Sd5c4o9UM,KQ6zr6kCPj8"]
[19:38:29] <panfist> i thought of using ajax post to request one item, and it would call itself when finished to request the next item
[19:38:47] <ch3mical> panfist: see ?ajaxcomplete

[19:38:53] <ajpiano> panfist: that's pretty much what you do... have the end of one trigger the beginning of th enext
[19:38:58] <ch3mical> Or use the complete callback
[19:39:00] <panfist> so each time one item is finished, a request/response has to take place

[19:39:14] <bot-t> panfist, Sequentially chain your callbacks in jQuery  Three ways  Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[19:39:35] <ch3mical> ajpiano: any idea why $.hasData($('#mydiv')[0]) is always true?
[19:39:46] <panfist> thank you
[19:40:17] <ajpiano> ch3mical, do you have events bound to it?
[19:40:29] <ch3mical> Yes
[19:40:34] <ajpiano> there's your answer then
[19:40:36] <ch3mical> Events are data?
[19:40:38] <ch3mical> Hmm
[19:40:42] <ajpiano> events are stored in .data
[19:40:47] <ch3mical> ugh
[19:40:53] <ch3mical> That complicates things
[19:41:10] <ajpiano> why don't you just check the element for the key you're looking for instead of just it having data
[19:41:20] <panfist> do you all agree with mr. irish that temp01's solution is the most premium way to sequentially chain callbacks?
[19:41:39] <ajpiano> panfist i like that way too, it's sexy
[19:41:48] <ch3mical> ajpiano: that's what I'm  (now) doing
[19:41:58] <panfist> that's a pretty sound endorsement
[19:42:09] <ch3mical> ajpiano: I just wanted to be able to check data period, but I'll have to check each data
[19:42:11] <ajpiano> panfist: me being the author of #2 also makes it one ;)
[19:42:17] <panfist> i saw that
[19:43:16] <ajpiano> ch3mical, you're trying to check the existence of multiple data keys?
[19:44:13] <ch3mical> Yeah, what's the best way? I was just going to loop
[19:44:31] <ch3mical> I just want at least one to exist
[19:44:42] <ajpiano> i would write a pseudo selector
[19:44:48] <ajpiano> this way you could just do like
[19:44:48] <ch3mical> How would I do that
[19:44:54] <ajpiano> $(elem).is(":mything")
[19:44:56] <ajpiano> 1 sec
[19:44:59] <ch3mical> k
[19:45:42] <ajpiano> ch3mical http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1457-How-To-Build-A-Custom-jQuery-Selector.htm
[19:46:28] <ch3mical> Nice, thanks
[19:46:55] <ch3mical> Would adding that much code be a performance hit versus just looping to find these values?
[19:47:06] <ajpiano> no
[19:47:15] <ajpiano> especially if you needed to do that check in a variety of places
[19:47:19] <ajpiano> where you'd be duplicating the same check
[19:47:33] <ch3mical> True
[19:47:38] <ch3mical> Ok, thanks
[19:47:38] <imjoshdean> ch3mical: Gotta keep that DRY
[19:47:45] <ajpiano> it would just move the logic into the selecot
[19:47:47] <ajpiano> selector
[19:47:52] <ch3mical> imjoshdean: ?
[19:47:55] <ajpiano> so you could even do like $("div:mything");
[19:48:13] <ajpiano> which is hella succinct
[19:48:14] <imjoshdean> ch3mical: Don't Repeat Yourself
[19:48:30] <ch3mical> Yeah
[19:48:33] <ch3mical> Gotcha
[19:48:46] <ch3mical> I try to minimize it as much as possible
[19:49:01] <ajpiano> using the pseudo should help with that !
[19:49:04] <ch3mical> ajpiano: so would "mything" then = the data key?
[19:49:12] <ajpiano> not necessarily
[19:49:15] <ajpiano> you could write it so that like
[19:49:33] <ajpiano> :mything would check for any of the keys you were checking for
[19:49:36] <ch3mical> Write it such that if "mything" isn't some other selector it checks for data keys?
[19:49:57] <ch3mical> Yeah ok
[19:50:02] <ch3mical> Sweeeet
[19:50:07] <ch3mical> I'm liking this idea a lot
[19:50:52] <ajpiano> it would basically be like return jQuery.data(elem, "something") || jQuery.data(elem, "somethingElse"); inside of the guts of that custom selector
[19:51:17] <pomke> Hiya, I have a question about draggable/droppable in ui, I have many large divs with a smaller div inside, I'd like my draggable, when positioned over one of the larger divs, to snap within the smaller inner div, but be draggable to the next set of divs as well, with some resistance
[19:51:24] <pomke> is that possible?
[19:51:39] <ch3mical> ajpiano: interesting... I'm going to have to play with this more tomorrow
[19:51:44] <ajpiano> what do you mean by "resistance" :p
[19:51:52] <ch3mical> I gotta head home, been at work like 12 hrs T_T
[19:51:55] <ajpiano> ch3mical, cool, yeah, give it a shot, it should help ya out
[19:52:12] <ajpiano> ha i'm just settling in for the night shift
[19:52:19] <ch3mical> fun ;p
[19:53:20] <pomke> ajpiano: resistance as in the 'distance' param to draggable, I guess resistance is less important. when I constrain a draggable with the containment option it jumps to the first match but I cannot move the draggable to the 2nd
[19:54:30] <ajpiano> well you can set any option dynamically, if you want to change it once it's dropped
[19:55:22] <pomke> not once it's dropped, I mean just say I have 10 divs with class foo, if I set containment: '.foo', the draggable will snap into the first match and cannot be dragged to any of the other .foo's
[19:55:54] <ajpiano> yah
[19:59:02] <pomke> What I'm doing is, http://pomke.com/random/pangurpad-editor-wip.png < screenshot, the man editable area is a scrollable <article contentEditable='true'> and as a user types it creates divs (I call those paragraphs), to each paragraph div I add an inner div that is positioned to the right of the text, it is a gutter for holding little 'note' tags, I want to be able to drag a note tag from another part of my app and if I drag it over a whole paragraph, it wi

[20:18:40] <DanAKAHollywood> djQuery: Just checked out your jsfiddle there. If you would style that input to match the menu it would be really slick
[20:28:47] <heshanh> ok.. if i added a div to the page in jquery using .apped(). how do i use the .css on it. it does nothing
[20:34:54] <clorith> I'm using jQuery's .draggable and .droppabel to move images around on a site. I'm rebuilding the <img> tag based on the ui.draggable.attr() feature, storing it in a variable then running a .remove() on the old content before using .html(variableName) to add it in the new droppable container.
[20:35:05] <clorith> For some reason the .remove also removes my variableName in some odd manner so that my .html() adds nothing to the page
[20:35:11] <clorith> The variable is still populated after the .remove() is called though
[20:35:29] <clorith> I have a live example at http://rstt.net/puzzle/ if someone cares to have a look see
[20:41:11] <djQuery> ?.before

[20:44:45] <heshanh> i managed to select it using .find() but the .css isnt working. if i run the script on firebug consol it works
[20:44:50] <djQuery> heshanh: you should be able to do it before or after you have appended it
[20:45:07] <djQuery> ?p @heshanh
[20:45:08] <bot-t> heshanh, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[20:45:42] <heshanh> ah acutally ur right. that was just silly. i shouldve called the .css AFTER i did the append not before
[20:45:55] <heshanh> there was no div to do .css haha
[20:48:32] <djQuery> heshanh: lol well just do it while u are creating it then   $('<div></div>', {title: 'testing', 'class': 'mydivclass', css: {border: "solid"}}).css({more: "css here"}).appendTo('content').css({more: 'evenmore here'});

[21:02:01] <Replayer> I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/NkkCJ/ and I want to have it so when you click any button, it toggles the others off. Right now I can't have the buttons find the others properly
[21:02:21] <Replayer> I have some stuff in there to trace out info, but to no avail
[21:02:56] <Replayer> On another note, 777 users a second ago, hopefully its my lucky day :D

[21:04:54] <Replayer> not the hovere
[21:05:11] <Replayer> the top piece of code, when you click them I want it to unpress the others
[21:05:14] <djQuery> but the rest of it seems to be working
[21:05:24] <Replayer> Let me show ya :D
[21:05:38] <djQuery> ok I gotcha you want to do away with the mouseup
[21:05:43] <Replayer> http://jsfiddle.net/

[21:05:58] <Replayer> http://jsfiddle.net/AyYFy/
[21:06:01] <Replayer> my mistake
[21:06:21] <Replayer> I just didnt know how to do it since my effect was originally made for the div
[21:06:45] <Replayer> I'd like it to work as a radiobutton basically, but with these effects in the div
[21:07:22] <wkmanire> Doesn't jQuery-UI have a selectable() method for this kind of thing?
[21:07:26] <Replayer> its my first day with any real CSS and jquery work, took me about 12 hours to get to this point, all the design was from scratch
[21:07:39] <wkmanire> Replayer: http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/
[21:07:42] <wkmanire> have you looked at that?
[21:07:46] <Replayer> yes
[21:08:03] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/NkkCJ/2/
[21:08:04] <Replayer> not quite what I need though, since that lets you select multiple/doesnt apply the effect to the divs
[21:08:15] <Replayer> O.O
[21:08:30] <Replayer> Are you a wizard?
[21:08:38] <wkmanire> More of a warlock.
[21:08:51] <djQuery> Replayer: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/NkkCJ/2/
[21:09:09] <Replayer> Just looked, that's perfect
[21:09:18] <wkmanire> nice

[21:10:01] <snufft> hey guys
[21:10:07] <wkmanire> Howdy
[21:10:10] <Replayer> That's why I was using the <li> stuff to begin with :/
[21:10:38] <pomke> is there any reason why drag/drop would mess with .mousemove event handlers? I have a mousemove event handler, and it is only triggered if I'm moving a draggable quickly over it, if I move a draggable slowly then mousemove isnt triggered at all
[21:11:38] <djQuery> Replayer: var x = -1;  $('.innerbox').each(function(index, elm){   if ($(this).hasClass('active')){ x = index; } });
[21:12:09] <snufft> does anyone know how I would go about finding out if an element is still in the viewpane, and if so, how much of it is visible? is there a plugin for that even? my google skills are failing me..
[21:12:27] <djQuery> Replayer:  correction var x = -1;  $('.innerbox').each(function(index, elm){   if ($(elm).hasClass('active')){ x = index; } });
[21:13:05] <djQuery> snufft: you might start with see .position

[21:14:55] <Replayer> Thank you djQuery, you're a life saver
[21:15:17] <djQuery> wkmanire: he said reduce. think we are gonna have issues if there is absolutely no Co2

[21:15:41] <wkmanire> How am I gonna operate my paint gun?
[21:20:03] <djQuery> wkmanire: nevermind we will probably put enough back in quick enough

[21:25:43] <dead> ive been using slideUp for a while and i decided to change it to animate so i could fine tune some things
[21:25:46] <Replayer> Resources aren't a great concern given the face FF is using 1.7GB mem atm
[21:26:15] <dead> so I just changed slideUp to animate({top: -50px;},"slow",function(...)) and now the animation doesnt work at all
[21:26:26] <Replayer> djquery, you going for autocomplete?
[21:26:28] <djQuery> cant get .before to work on my label
[21:26:31] <dead> i assumed i could just drop in animate in place of slideUp
[21:26:32] <dead> ?
[21:26:49] <djQuery> Replayer:  a multi select kinda autocomplete
[21:27:17] <Replayer> As in the option to select multiple results, or to have it autocomplete segments of options?
[21:27:19] <djQuery> supposed to create laebels and stick the in the span that is surrounding the input
[21:27:32] <djQuery> as you select an option
[21:27:45] <djQuery> think of taggin a comment or Q
[21:28:12] <Replayer> So you can click an option from the autocomplete, and then enter info next to it?
[21:29:42] <dead> is there some requirement for animate to work that slideUp doesn't share? I just want to animate the top value by -sizeofelement
[21:30:03] <dead> but instead it just jumps up, instead of actually slowly animating..
[21:31:07] <gf3> code?

[21:32:38] <Replayer> This what you're talking about?
[21:33:38] <djQuery> Replayer: he needs to call stop on the animation before doing the animation
[21:34:49] <Replayer> DjQuery, not sure what the issue is with your code (Or the full goal of it) but I'm probably not going to be much use anyways, given my novice-ness to jquery

[21:37:43] <supertrue> yes, unless I should obviously be doing something else

[21:39:28] <Replayer> Any easy way to convert decimal to alpha? (EX: "1" = A, "2"=B etc...) Wondering if there is a proper method, or if a switch for it would be easier (only need to use 1-4)
[21:39:49] <blast_hardcheese> Is there a way to modify values in css definitions that will apply for all new objects created?

[21:40:20] <wkmanire> Replayer: You can make an array if you want to convert it that way.
[21:40:42] <Replayer> Gotcha, I'll do an associative array then
[21:40:42] <wkmanire> Replay: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".split('')[3]
[21:40:46] <dxgriffiths> supertrue: nice handle.
[21:40:51] <Replayer> or like that
[21:40:52] <supertrue> thx
[21:40:56] <wkmanire> ? eval "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".split('')[3]
[21:40:56] <bot-t> wkmanire: "D"
[21:41:43] <supertrue> djQuery: I'm trying to do stuff to the variables in budget.php, so I don't want to just append the GET data
[21:42:03] <supertrue> djQuery: (unless I'm misunderstanding something in your revision)
[21:45:16] <djQuery> supertrue: well in budget you are processing the data: right. well after processing it just return the neccessary html. you could even reduce it to http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/75VDp/6/
[21:45:41] <djQuery> supertrue: or you could take a look at see ?malsup ajaxform

[21:46:25] <djQuery> ?botsnack
[21:46:25] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[21:46:37] <supertrue> lol
[21:46:53] <supertrue> ok I am going to try your code
[21:46:58] <supertrue> thanks brb
[21:47:17] <djQuery> supertrue: now with that budget.php needs to return some html
[21:47:37] <supertrue> yes
[21:49:41] <dead> Replayer: no, its not the margin issue
[21:50:07] <wkmanire> ?scoobiesnack
[21:50:09] <dead> Replayer: the issue is that the item is being appended in the complete function of the animate call
[21:50:09] <bot-t> wkmanire, Couldn't find "scoobiesnack" in jQuery Docs.
[21:50:14] <wkmanire> :(
[21:50:17] <dead> but the animate doesnt happen, just the append does
[21:50:32] <dead> so the delay occures whatever its set to....then the item just disapears (due to the append) so that part is correct
[21:51:05] <dead> but the animation should be happening ...and its not
[21:51:22] <dead> when i change nothing but animate( to slideUp(, the slide works fine, tahts just not the animation i want or else i'd use it
[21:51:26] <dead> heh
[21:51:38] <dead> can I see the definition of slideUp? I assume its just a shortcut to animate...right?
[21:55:10] <supertrue> djQuery: the variables still don't seem to be going into $_GET['state']  etc in budget.php
[21:56:45] <djQuery> supertrue: hmmm .load might do a get instead of a post
[21:57:07] <djQuery> meaning that the params will be in the url.
[21:57:23] <djQuery> not good with php how do you get the url parameters?
[21:57:55] <supertrue> using $_GET['parametername']
[21:58:59] <juria_roberts> heyy why is this showing me as text is not a function?
[21:59:01] <juria_roberts> j(e.target).parent().siblings()[4].text('Suspended-Allow Views/Clicks');
[21:59:24] <supertrue> so if the url is budget.php?state=ak&area=rural, those values in php will be in $_GET['state'] and $_GET['area']
[21:59:48] <gf3> juria_roberts: because you are accessing the actual DOM element, not the jQuery element
[22:00:14] <juria_roberts> gf3: do u know how I can change the text
[22:00:21] <gf3> juria_roberts: replace [4] with .eq(4)
[22:00:28] <juria_roberts> gf3: k
[22:00:35] <juria_roberts> supertrue: yeah
[22:00:36] <supertrue> djQuery: so what I'm saying is that $_GET['state'] etc are coming back empty in both your version and my version
[22:01:52] <mafoo_> can anyone help, Im trying to get delegate() to function the same way live() does
[22:02:16] <Cork> mafoo_: whats the problem?
[22:02:19] <mafoo_> on elements added to the page by a jquery function after page load
[22:02:31] <mafoo_> so i have a add row button
[22:02:47] <mafoo_> that adds a div with a link in it
[22:02:50] <juria_roberts> gf3: thanks it worked
[22:03:04] <mafoo_> that deletes the containing div
[22:03:13] <mafoo_> works all nice and well
[22:03:17] <djQuery> Replayer: just got some formating left to do http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/UsLnM/7/
[22:03:27] <mafoo_> on divs present when the page loads
[22:03:46] <Cork> mafoo_: .delegate(document, '<event>') is the exact same as .live('<event>')
[22:03:57] <gf3> mafoo_: paste?
[22:04:04] <mafoo_> doesnt seem to work the same
[22:04:05] <Replayer> djQuery, when I go to that, should I expect anything to happen when I type in the box?
[22:04:06] <Cork> mafoo_: the element you give to delegate has to exist, just like document is needed for live
[22:04:20] <djQuery> Replayer: yeah type a j
[22:04:26] <Cork> mafoo_: as long as thats accomplished, the rest is the same
[22:04:31] <djQuery> then select an item and click on it
[22:04:37] <Replayer> Nothing happens at my end
[22:04:41] <Replayer> FF 4.x
[22:05:06] <Replayer> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/UsLnM/7/embedded/result/
[22:05:11] <Replayer> doesn't work there either
[22:05:19] <Cork> mafoo_: sorry i mixed up the syntax
[22:05:36] <mafoo_> Cork:  have a look at that demo
[22:05:51] <mafoo_> press the trash can on the existing divs
[22:05:53] <Cork> mafoo_: what demo?
[22:05:55] <mafoo_> then try adding a new one
[22:06:03] <mafoo_> the one i /msg ed you
[22:06:24] <djQuery> wtf? getting this.innerText is undefined in ff on this http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/UsLnM/7/
[22:06:42] <Cork> mafoo_: $('<selector1>').delegate('<selector2>', '<event>') <selector1> can't be replaced
[22:06:53] <Cork> the dynamic part is selector2
[22:07:17] <Replayer> Yeah, it's partially why I didn't understand the purpose behind it before ,I was expecting it to do an autocomplete, but nothing happened
[22:08:01] <mafoo_> Cork:  if i change it to $("#breakdownDiv div").delegate('a.deleteRow','click',function(){
[22:08:05] <mafoo_> it doesnt work still
[22:08:19] <djQuery> Replayer: try this now http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/UsLnM/9/
[22:08:20] <Cork> mafoo_: is breakdownDiv ever replaced?
[22:08:23] <mafoo_> no
[22:08:29] <mafoo_> its the container
[22:08:45] <Cork> is the second div inside it ever replaced?
[22:09:06] <mafoo_> they are added to
[22:09:10] <mafoo_> added
[22:09:12] <mafoo_> and delted
[22:09:20] <Cork> $("#breakdownDiv div").delegate('a.deleteRow') should prob be $("#breakdownDiv").delegate('div a.deleteRow'
[22:09:28] <Replayer> I get the autocomplete now, but whenI enter anything into the tag it textbox, the only thing I can dowith it is trash it
[22:09:40] <Replayer> is that what its supposed to do right now?
[22:09:44] <mafoo_> Cork:
[22:09:52] <mafoo_> Cork:  ok, cool i think i got it
[22:10:03] <mafoo_> Cork:  $("#breakdownDiv").delegate('div a.deleteRow','click',function(){ seems to work
[22:10:05] <mafoo_> :)
[22:10:13] <mafoo_> Cork: cheers for the help
[22:10:33] <Cork> mafoo_: you bound the event on the divs inside #breakdownDiv
[22:10:39] <Cork> not #breakdownDiv
[22:11:12] <juria_roberts> how do i add a space inside text() cause  j(e.target).parent().siblings().eq(4).text('  Suspended-Allow Views/Clicks'); &  j(e.target).parent().siblings().eq(4).text(' &nbsp;Suspended-Allow Views/Clicks'); dont work?
[22:11:19] <supertrue> djQuery: aha, .load() uses POST when data is provided -- so changing the php  to $_POST['state'] works!
[22:11:29] <juria_roberts> note the space shud be before first character
[22:11:37] <Cork> ?p @ juria_roberts
[22:11:37] <bot-t> juria_roberts, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/

[22:12:24] <mafoo_> Cork:  cheers again
[22:12:38] <juria_roberts> gf3: css for text?
[22:12:43] <Replayer> DJquery, just finished my prototype design, http://jsfiddle.net/Hiphop03199/dQcq2/2/embedded/result/ its going to be part of a quizzing website designed to run on tablets/itouches
[22:12:59] <gf3> juria_roberts: sounds like you're trying to alter the presentation of the text
[22:13:15] <juria_roberts> gf3: yeah
[22:13:31] <juria_roberts> gf3: i thot a space ought to do it
[22:13:33] <gf3> juria_roberts: that's the job of CSS :D
[22:14:53] <juria_roberts> gf3: well ill leave it as it is and hope the boss doesnt see the difference
[22:16:16] <Brodingo> wut
[22:32:20] <juria_roberts> gf3: i solved it by using html instead so html('&nbsp:wateva') worked

[23:03:11] <Cork> nut no its the only bot in here
[23:03:14] <ch3mical> What the fuck is the Internet?
[23:03:15] <djQuery> .seen bot-t

[23:03:16] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 2 minutes and 40 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[23:03:31] <Replayer> djquery, you wait until now?
[23:03:35] * Replayer raises his fist
[23:03:51] <ch3mical> -_-
[23:04:23] <djQuery> Replayer: did you find it then?
[23:04:52] <Replayer> Yes, but the point of my work was more to have a div as a button
[23:04:58] <Replayer> wait
[23:05:00] <Replayer> this does that too
[23:05:03] <Replayer> goddamn
[23:05:28] <djQuery> well u learned stuff
[23:05:37] <Replayer> Yes, I learned a ton today
[23:05:42] <Replayer> I have like 150 tabs open in FF
[23:05:55] <djQuery> like how to use google to see if there were any specific jquery stuff for mobile
[23:06:07] <Replayer> And If I found this first, I would never have taught myself the other stuff
[23:06:23] <djQuery> see silver lining
[23:06:49] <Replayer> ^
[23:06:57] <Replayer> you linked me the cloud then I guess
[23:07:47] <djQuery> Replayer: ok this is a little better http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/UsLnM/10/
[23:07:59] <djQuery> just gotta get rid of the cariage return or what not
[23:08:08] <Replayer> gotcha!
[23:08:10] <Replayer> one thing though
[23:08:22] <Replayer> the ui gets cut off in FF
[23:08:39] <Replayer> I saw the issue whenI used ASP
[23:08:49] <Replayer> but it does it for em all
[23:09:05] <clorith> alexparker: Dunno if you replied to me earlier, I was caught up in the netsplit =)
[23:09:15] <alexparker> i did
[23:09:17] <alexparker> whats the netsplit?
[23:09:21] <alexparker> i left you a memo
[23:09:54] <clorith> ahh, ok I'll check my memo =)
[23:10:30] * clorith help read
[23:10:40] <ch3mical> heh
[23:10:40] <alexparker> hit /msg MemoServ List
[23:10:53] <clorith> yeah, I was looking for the "new" parameter
[23:11:08] <clorith> That looks so much simpler then mine :o
[23:12:18] <clorith> Would that move the entire element though? My main problem was that even though the position on the screen changed, the actual html markup stayed in the same location, which would make the solving function not work at all
[23:13:42] <razamatan> is there a .click() like thing for the onreset event on forms?
[23:14:10] <alexparker> clorith: um i think i tmoves it
[23:14:54] <Replayer> I'm probably going to be around quite abit now I know how helpful this channel can be (Don't worry, I'll still try to figure stuff out myself) :P
[23:15:02] <clorith> nope, it just changes the css of it adding position: relative and then whatnot =/
[23:15:16] <alexparker> no it moves it
[23:15:24] <alexparker> do you have firebug?
[23:15:39] <clorith> I have chrome inspector
[23:15:56] <alexparker> eesh
[23:16:00] <clorith> well, they "move", but only in the case that the style attribute is modified
[23:16:02] <djQuery> razamatan: $('form').bind('onreset', function(e){ do stuff here});
[23:16:32] <alexparker> get on firefox and get on firebug and paste that block of code i wrote for you into the firebug console, and hit run
[23:16:34] <alexparker> it works
[23:16:45] <alexparker> this line: $(this).find('.parent').append(ui.draggable.css({top:'',left:''}));
[23:17:03] <alexparker> it appends the draggable into the .parent anchor
[23:17:18] <clorith> is there no way to move it entirely though?
[23:17:25] <alexparker> and it just clears the top, left styles that are put inline when the item is being dragged
[23:17:31] <alexparker> it does move entirely i promise
[23:17:33] <clorith> oh?
[23:17:47] <clorith> let me recheck my inspector, I might've just looked at th ewrong one then
[23:18:10] <razamatan> djQuery: i'll try that, thanks
[23:18:16] <clorith> ahaha
[23:18:20] <clorith> I'm gonna go over here feel stupid now ;)
[23:18:30] <clorith> You were right, it moves them and everything, my bad
[23:18:34] <clorith> Thank yo uvery much for the help
[23:18:43] <alexparker> you could do  $(this).find('.parent').append(ui.draggable);  and it would move it, but then it goes all wacko, because dropping it on the droppable makes it keep the inline style from the dragging, so you have to reset it as you are appending it
[23:18:56] <alexparker> haha dont feel stupid
[23:19:05] <alexparker> now you wont forget though :)
[23:19:25] <alexparker> most importantly is to understand the concept of jQuery objects and chaining
[23:20:05] <razamatan> djQuery: hmm... a confirm dialog i have going isn't firing on that bind('onreset'..) context
[23:20:05] <clorith> aye
[23:20:06] <alexparker> so ui.draggable returns the Jquery draggable item with all the methods, and on any jQuery object if you call .css() it returns the same object again but with altered css, so thats why the append works to move it
[23:20:45] <clorith> Excellent
[23:20:45] <alexparker> haha after i got it working, i moved all the images into the puzzle space and mixed them up then re assembled the puzzle for fun
[23:20:49] <djQuery> DAMIT did I miss towel day?
[23:21:02] <clorith> I thoguht the draggable would move the entire markup to droppable by default =)
[23:21:21] <alexparker> nope :) not by default
[23:21:43] <alexparker> i also set in that :empty condition so that you cant drop two images in the same box (which it was doing before)
[23:21:51] <alexparker> when i was workin on it
[23:21:56] <djQuery> razamatan:  is it onReset then?
[23:22:13] <clorith> oh that's brilliant, I hadn't thought of that
[23:22:29] <razamatan> djQuery: nm.. it was supposed to be .bind('reset'...) not 'onreset')
[23:22:31] <razamatan> doh
[23:23:11] <denysonique> if I .remove() or .detach() an <img> will the src of it still load?
[23:23:55] <alexparker> clorith: haha i just got done making the most complex jquery draggable, droppable, sortable, ui with a ton of ajax and other key interactions - i got in the habit of trying to think of every possible combination of what someone could do
[23:24:08] <alexparker> its a good practice for ui developers - i'm just learning
[23:24:32] <juria_roberts> how to select an option in select through jquery?
[23:24:42] <clorith> Yeah, I'm loving jQuery UI (and jQuery in general tbh), it's made so many projects that much easier to implement for clients
[23:24:51] <clorith> This one was for my own stuff though
[23:25:04] <alexparker> good job, its fun - and i really like your idea haha
[23:25:33] <alexparker> make sure to add z-index: 999; to .ui-draggable-dragging style rule
[23:25:45] <clorith> so it doen'st end up under other elements?
[23:25:57] <alexparker> they are currently floating under the other images that come after
[23:25:59] <alexparker> yeah
[23:26:00] <clorith> *doesn't even
[23:28:59] <tumbri> Can you please tell me how to upload a file using jquery ajax?
[23:29:01] <juria_roberts> how to select an option in select through jquery?
[23:29:28] <Trisox> inposible!
[23:29:29] <Trisox> :P
[23:29:33] <Cork> tumbri: you can use the File in html5
[23:29:41] <Trisox> ? :selected
[23:30:18] <alexparker> clorith: hey try this
[23:30:19] <Trisox> is to find out what is selected to set something selected use .attr
[23:30:20] <Cork> tumbri: if your not ok with demanding really modern browsers (ff3.5, chrome, opera 9.6, ie9)
[23:30:30] <ngharo> juria_roberts: change the current selection or get the current selection?
[23:30:32] <Cork> tumbri: you have to resport to plugins like flash
[23:30:41] <juria_roberts> ngharo: change
[23:30:55] * alexparker add this line ui.draggable.removeClass('ui-draggable-dragging'); just above the $(this).find('.parent')... part
[23:31:04] <tumbri> Cork:But i want to do jquery ajax
[23:31:09] <Trisox> $('.selectboxthingy').attr("selected", selected);
[23:31:09] <alexparker> clorith: then....
[23:31:33] <Cork> tumbri: ya, ajax can send data after its been read with the File api, but as i said only really modern browsers have it
[23:31:47] <clorith> alexparker: above the .is(':empty') or the other one ?
[23:31:50] <Cork> tumbri: older browsers doesn't have support to send files over ajax
[23:31:52] <Trisox> juria_roberts: do you understand?
[23:31:56] <Cork> tumbri: so jqueyr can't do it
[23:31:59] <juria_roberts> Trisox: that wont select an option
[23:32:03] <alexparker> clorith: inside the if above the appending line
[23:32:10] <clorith> aight
[23:32:10] <Trisox> it does
[23:32:17] <alexparker> then add this to your css
[23:32:17] <alexparker> http://pastebin.com/F9n7Sy20
[23:32:26] <juria_roberts> Trisox: it doesnt accept any option
[23:32:32] <ngharo> juria_roberts: you can just set the value using .val()
[23:32:36] <alexparker> it'll make a nice little "visual feedback" enhancement
[23:32:47] <Cork> tumbri: the problem is, that without the file api, you can actually get the file data in js, so you can't send it
[23:32:53] <juria_roberts> ngharo: yeah that should work
[23:33:02] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/Zdfrk/
[23:33:04] <Trisox> juria_roberts: make a js fiddle with what you realy want
[23:33:11] <tumbri> Cork:send me any links to do jquery ajax
[23:33:21] <razamatan> how do you have multiple attribute seletors for a selector?
