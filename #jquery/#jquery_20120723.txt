[00:00:05] <krz> because the sky is blue
[00:00:10] <krz> good enough?
[00:00:14] <tw2113> nope
[00:00:47] <tw2113> i should use that argument for russian style socialism
[00:00:57] <Andweeeee> lol
[00:01:19] <azbyin> tw2113, maybe his boss asked him for this feature o.0
[00:01:43] <tw2113> and is it so wrong for me to ask for justification of things?
[00:02:09] <azbyin> not really. his responses were not really answers to your question
[00:02:27] <Andweeeee> juha_ props for the tip but it didn't work anywhere I put it. it would either break it or it would kill the animation
[00:04:15] <Andweeeee> I think we're all here because we like to know how things work‚Ä¶so I don't really understand the hateraide for asking why. that's just me. no bad vibes intended
[00:05:27] <krz> i don't see why a reason would make a diff?
[00:05:40] <krz> if i told you my dog wanted it that way. what diff would it make?
[00:06:27] <tw2113> first i'd call your dog smart for being able to speak in english, then i'd ask him why he wanted it that way
[00:06:29] <Whirl3d> krz, let's face it the reason why is that's an assinine thing to want to do and chances are there's a better solution for what you want that is easier to accomplish and will look better.
[00:06:37] <MichMich> Morning guys
[00:06:58] <Whirl3d> Morning MichMich
[00:07:08] <krz> Whirl3d: thats what I'm looking for. an alternative solution. who cares what my dog eats or likes?
[00:07:39] <Whirl3d> Because if you explain the f*&ing goal, there may be a better way to get there than what you are trying to do
[00:07:45] <tw2113> except your goal, thus far perceived, is still the same, text persistently on the right side of the cursor, i assume no matter where you click in the input
[00:08:04] <Whirl3d> If you explain why it has to be like that, maybe we could come up with an alternative
[00:08:16] <Whirl3d> But either way, man, you are asking for help. Check your attitutde
[00:10:47] <Whirl3d> And besides, krz, we have been doing this for long enough to have seen a lot of folks with similar requests that once the real story is revealed, that's not really what they wanted at all.
[00:11:25] <krz> found a solution
[00:11:47] <coldhead> great work everyone, take 5
[00:11:48] <tw2113> i'm legitimately curious to see what it is
[00:12:11] <tw2113> at worst, i learn something new
[00:12:22] <MichMich> Wow, there's a good vibe hanging here... luv it! ;)
[00:12:45] <tw2113> yeah, i'm keeping my mouth in check MichMich
[00:13:31] <Andweeeee> dude krz post found solution!
[00:13:44] <Whirl3d> you know it's gonna be a placeholder solution
[00:13:58] <coldhead> my money is on flash
[00:14:13] <tw2113> The Flash stole your money too? that bastard
[00:14:18] <Andweeeee> i dont know what that means, but a solution is better than an unresolved problem
[00:14:58] <Whirl3d> Andweeeee, not all the time. Sometimes a solution to one problem just opens up 50 others.
[00:15:12] <Andweeeee> see also:javascript
[00:15:13] <Andweeeee> zing.
[00:16:02] <MichMich> So, what was the problem which we were discussing here?
[00:16:32] <Andweeeee> i dont even know anymore. all i know is that my div keeps bouncing due to flawed logic on my part.
[00:16:45] <Andweeeee> because im tired
[00:16:51] <Andweeeee> http://jsfiddle.net/sjjuz/8/
[00:16:57] <coldhead> we're trying to solve the halting problem in pure CSS
[00:19:56] <blackspotwiggins> Andweeeee, why are you binding a new handler on every click?
[00:21:28] <Whirl3d> Andweee, http://jsfiddle.net/sjjuz/12/
[00:22:38] <Ou42> OK. I found what I was looking for. "$("#box").animate({height:"300px"}).animate({height:"100px"});"
[00:22:42] <Andweeeee> Whirl3d you are my hero. i really need to do this more.
[00:22:48] <Ou42> but what is that called? is that called "ping-ponging"?
[00:23:31] <Whirl3d> Ou42, that's called queuing two animations on an element.
[00:23:57] <Ou42> Whirl3d - thanks!
[00:24:20] <Andweeeee> do they execute one after another or do they execute simultaniously when you chain them together like that?
[00:24:38] <Ou42> Whirl3d: i take it that isn't standard js code, right? js doesn't have queing like that, right?
[00:24:40] <Whirl3d> one after the other unless you add the option Queue:false;
[00:24:41] <tw2113> i'm still waiting for the solution from krz
[00:24:50] <eni> Is it possible to make GET+json synchronous ajax calls using jquery?
[00:25:06] <Whirl3d> the jquery animate method queues animations by default
[00:25:56] <coldhead> SHOW ME SOMETHING ROUND AND I'LL ANALYSE THE FORM
[00:26:20] * Ou42 shows coldhead a wooden block
[00:26:23] <Andweeeee> Whirl3d, I want to send you cookies.
[00:37:08] <krz> nah used CGI
[00:38:29] <xcv> log test: </td><td>blah</td><td>blah2</td>
[00:38:33] <krz> gtfo :-P using a variation of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3282505/highlight-text-as-you-type-on-textarea
[00:38:50] <krz> and looking at codemirror
[00:42:09] <Andweeeee> y'all rule. bedtime. Andwee out.
[00:55:51] <eni> I had a $.get and replaced it with a $.ajax, and the GET isn't even being executed..
[00:56:50] <xcv> the post works?
[00:57:25] <eni> i didn't set a 'type' so i'm implying it's get by default
[00:58:22] <eni> nope, neither does it work with type:'post'
[00:59:12] <eni> here's the code http://pastebin.com/af7K9PJn
[01:00:01] <hooloovoo> eni: where does it go wrong? does it send data at all?
[01:00:13] <eni> nope,
[01:00:23] <hooloovoo> do you get a error in console?
[01:00:29] <eni> it sends nothing. everything between the click and the ajax call gets executed.
[01:00:54] <eni> oh my fault, i didn't see the error console
[01:02:55] <hooloovoo> eni: =)
[01:03:21] <eni> ok, now another problem (the real one).
[01:03:35] <eni> i changed from .get to .ajax to have syncronous calls.
[01:04:02] <hooloovoo> why do you need them syncronous?
[01:04:05] <eni> so i had to put the code of success: inside the .done(). Still i can't see the alert with the length of the received data inside (it's being received!)
[01:04:12] <eni> hooloovoo, i need the data to be put in divs.
[01:04:27] <hooloovoo> eni: you can't do that on a async call?
[01:04:27] <eni> so i can update the divs once the data is received, not before.
[01:04:39] <hooloovoo> update on callback
[01:04:55] <eni> hmm
[01:04:57] <eni> would that work?
[01:05:02] <hooloovoo> synchronous calls are not something you wanna use
[01:05:03] <hooloovoo> like ever
[01:05:07] <hooloovoo> yes
[01:05:42] <eni> because i tried something like : success:function(data){ alert(data.length); } and nothing happened, (while I had $.get instead of $.ajax)
[01:06:01] <hooloovoo> eni: do you get your response as a json string?
[01:06:22] <hooloovoo> if it's not valid json when you have your datatype set to json it won't run success callback
[01:07:06] <eni> no
[01:07:07] <eni> array
[01:07:21] <eni> maybe i should try with jsonp
[01:07:36] <hooloovoo> just leave the datatype blank or set it to html or something
[01:07:42] <hooloovoo> or send valid json
[01:08:06] <hooloovoo> jsonp is like json, but inside a function(jsonhere)
[01:08:07] <eni> on the serverside i'm using json_encode (php)
[01:08:39] <hooloovoo> eni: run your response through this http://jsonlint.com/
[01:08:42] <hooloovoo> and see if it validates
[01:09:39] <SoleSoul> Hi. I have a bunch of accordions side by side. I can achieve this if I give them the css style display:inline-block. The problem is, when I give them this style, and I click on one of the headers of the accordion, it changes it position and moves down. When I click on the first header again, it goes back into position. What's going on? How do I put them side by side without breaking the accordion's behavior?
[01:10:10] <hooloovoo> SoleSoul: put them in a wrapper that used inline-block.
[01:10:12] <eni> hooloovoo, the problem is that the code is very big
[01:10:22] <hooloovoo> eni: that site can prolly handle it.
[01:10:23] <SoleSoul> hooloovoo: ok, thanks
[01:10:26] <SoleSoul> I'll try that
[01:10:55] <hooloovoo> eni: also, just put the json there
[01:10:58] <coldhead> SoleSoul: animations change the display to block, so you need to ensure it looks "right" with display:block
[01:11:11] <hooloovoo> exactly what you get back from the server when you send the xhr request.
[01:11:56] <SoleSoul> coldhead: so wrapping them in a div with the style as hooloovoo suggested would do it?
[01:12:30] <hooloovoo> SoleSoul: yup, that'll work fine.
[01:12:36] <SoleSoul> :)
[01:12:53] <coldhead> i'm just trying to explain why they move, the fix is hooloovoo's department
[01:13:00] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[01:13:07] <eni> hooloovoo, Parse error on line 12:
[01:13:07] <eni> ...nom": null,        null: "CPDP",    .. Expecting 'STRING'
[01:13:25] <hooloovoo> coldhead: nooooo?
[01:13:37] <eni> i have some null:null cases
[01:13:44] <eni> and some foo:null;
[01:13:46] <hooloovoo> eni: yup. you better check your backend code. =)
[01:14:01] <coldhead> null: null sounds icky
[01:14:05] <eni> yea
[01:14:12] <eni> that's the result of a sql query :/
[01:14:19] <eni> ran through json_encode
[01:15:13] <Ou42> good night #jquery
[01:15:18] <hooloovoo> night Ou42
[01:21:32] <ui_> .
[01:23:17] <SoleSoul> hooloovoo: As long as there is only one accordion, your solution works, but if there is more than one, accordions change their position. Would you please take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/2XWr4/
[01:24:15] <coldhead> if anyone needs me, i'm outside for a while, please bellow
[01:36:26] <SoleSoul> Can anyone enlighten me why theses accordions move with each other while animating? (clock on "done" and "todo" on both of them some times to see the weird behavior)
[01:36:32] <SoleSoul> http://jsfiddle.net/2XWr4/
[01:39:17] <SoleSoul> * click :)
[01:46:08] <ui_> SoleSoul: don't know if it's the cause of the problem, but in the documentation "accordion" is an id, not a class http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[01:46:25] <ui_> and of course, one can not have more than one element with the same id
[01:47:19] <SoleSoul> ui_: Thanks, accordion is an id there because they have only one. I have multiple accordions which I add dynamically. Isn't class the way to do it in this case?
[01:48:33] <ui_> where in the doc do you read that it is an id "because they have only one"?
[01:52:04] <SoleSoul> ui_: actually nowhere, but I can't think of a reason why id vs class would make any change but I'll try it :)
[01:52:07] <ui_> SoleSoul, meanwhile I found this one, hope it helps: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/multiple-jquery-accordions-on-one-page read the lowermost answer (by sqlsolver)
[01:52:18] <ui_> essentially, try with different id's
[01:53:47] <SoleSoul> ui_: I tried it. Same behavior :(
[01:56:22] <SoleSoul> wth... I found a solution. no idea why it works. I changed the css "inline-block" to "inline-table"
[01:57:43] <HashNuke> I'm trying to hide an element using $("#my_ele").hide() from the console but it's still visible in the DOM. I checked with $("#my_ele") in the console and the selector is a valid one.
[01:58:56] <fuchstronaut> HashNuke: did you check the css styles applied to that element before and after using hide() on it?
[01:59:22] <HashNuke> fuchstronaut: I checked the selector $("#my_ele") and it does return the element.
[01:59:27] <fuchstronaut> HashNuke: did you check the css styles applied to that element before and after using hide() on it?
[01:59:33] <HashNuke> fuchstronaut: yes
[01:59:51] <fuchstronaut> does the display and visivility change?
[02:00:11] <fuchstronaut> maybe theres something like display: block !important;
[02:00:15] <HashNuke> nope.
[02:00:33] <fuchstronaut> then you need to make a jsfiddle
[02:01:21] <HashNuke> fuchstronaut: I've used jquery for years now, this is a part of a pretty large app. Thanks for the pointer to "display: block !important" I checked and it isnt there.
[02:01:36] <HashNuke> This has been puzzling me for a couple hours now
[02:02:28] <fuchstronaut> I'm pretty sure there's something you have overlooked, like it always is with simple tasks that take hours to solve
[02:02:47] <fuchstronaut> It's just hard to help without seeing the code
[02:03:19] <HashNuke> ya I understand that. it's a bit difficult here to put the whole app to jsbin, which is why I havent put it up yet.
[02:03:24] <eni> hooloovoo, i get those null values because of french accents
[02:03:44] <fuchstronaut> try to change the bgcolor with .css() to see if you are hiding the right element
[02:06:52] <HashNuke> fuchstronaut: ya I'll try that.
[02:08:21] <Hippie> hey! is there a easy way to do this using jquery ?
[02:08:22] <Hippie> http://jsfiddle.net/DQgbT/
[02:08:24] <HashNuke> fuchstronaut: Changing CSS doesnt change the DOM element's style. Any operation performed on the element seems to be useless.
[02:09:06] <fuchstronaut> to me it looks like you've selected an element, but the wrong on
[02:10:58] <HashNuke> fuchstronaut: Does that happen when the stuff is run in an async callback?
[02:11:42] <fuchstronaut> if the element is there, there should be no problem altering it from a ajax callback
[02:12:03] <Hippie> Hello!! Does anybody know if this is possible with minor jquery
[02:12:23] <HashNuke> fuchstronaut: Ya just tried. async was the problem.
[02:13:25] <fuchstronaut> HashNuke: that's where sample code helps ;)
[02:13:32] <fuchstronaut> Hippie: what?
[02:14:29] <Hippie> fuchstronaut: you see I have the top two lists and would like to mix them up into the bottom one
[02:15:11] <fuchstronaut> I see no code
[02:17:12] <eni> how do i append $k=>$v to an array?
[02:17:58] <miCSu> eni: arr[$k] = $v ?
[02:18:10] <eni> hmm yes.
[02:18:17] <eni> thank you
[02:18:35] <miCSu> just remember that it replaces current value of arr[$k] if exists
[02:18:59] <eni> thanks.
[02:19:10] <eni> i saw some code like for loop (arr[] = $i)
[02:19:14] <eni> does that append to arr?
[02:19:38] <miCSu> didn't really get what u r trying
[02:20:44] <eni> foreach ($playlist_ids as $pid) {	$playlist[] = row_array("select v.*, ............"); }
[02:20:58] <eni> $playlist is defined as $playlist = array(); just before the loop.
[02:21:03] <miCSu> umm, is that php?
[02:21:09] <eni> i think so.
[02:21:11] <Hippie> fuchstronaut: http://jsfiddle.net/DQgbT/ ... are you sure?
[02:21:38] <eni> i read this code in a .php file and it's working. It looks like it's appending to playlist the result of row_array
[02:21:51] <fuchstronaut> Hippie: yes I am sure, theres just html markup
[02:21:53] <miCSu> nope, cause u have no values in the array before u loop it
[02:22:15] <miCSu> umm
[02:22:24] <miCSu> sry, is $playlist_ids defined?
[02:22:47] <Hippie> fuchstronaut: i know. thats what you must look at. i want the two lists at the top to be converted dynamically via jquery
[02:23:14] <fuchstronaut> Hippie: yes, you can manipulate DOM with jQuery.. i dont get your question ;)
[02:24:24] <miCSu> eni: if $playlist_ids's defined and has values, that should work.. it u want to specify the key for values in $playlist array u could also use $playlist[$pid] = row_array(... inside the loop
[02:24:39] <miCSu> *if
[02:39:00] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/YcDET/3/ (Highcharts) - is there any way to disable the tooltip's right and left borders, or increase its bottom padding?
[02:40:55] <abletony84> Sorry maybe this is more of a JS question seeing as how Highcharts ain't specifically a jQuery plugin.
[02:51:02] <guy> Anyone know of any jQuery rating system using Emoticons? (I care only about the icons)
[03:08:32] <Sebah> hi! it's there an jquery viewport plugin that ONLY binds to the element which is FULLY in view ( i also have to mention i have a scrolling page )?
[03:13:02] <coldhead> Sebah: like this? http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport
[03:13:54] <Sebah> coldhead: tried that one, but it doesn't seem to be working on my parallax. i'm gonna keep looking! thanks though :)
[03:14:23] <coldhead> that's the only one i've ever seen, sorry buddy
[03:14:42] <coldhead> probably a good place to start if you need to modify it yourself
[03:15:57] <Sebah> coldhead: no worries mate, it's okay. for future reference https://github.com/cpatik/within-viewport - i consider this one as being a bit more complex :)
[03:16:13] <coldhead> oh cool, thanks doc
[03:21:23] <bamarni> hi, I'm using getJSON, how can I do to abort jquery waiting for the previous request return each time I'm calling getJSON?

[03:38:33] <bamarni> coldhead: it's ok, it was an issue with the xhr variable scope, it should be defined outside the function, thx
[03:38:41] <zatan> $('#quanity').live('change',function(quanity_changed) {});  is this syntax okay ?
[03:46:39] <juha_> zatan: what do you think quanity_changes on this case is?

[04:32:30] <Depth> Hi
[04:34:19] <Depth> Does an opposite exist to the .not()-function?
[04:34:35] <juha_> .is()
[04:34:41] <Depth> oh, thx :D
[04:34:54] <juha_> also, !$(elem).not()
[04:36:31] <Depth> yep, exactly this function is needed ^^
[04:36:47] <xec_> Depth: .filter() is the opposite of .not()
[04:37:04] <Depth> not .is()?
[04:37:20] <xec_> Depth !$(elem).is(sel) is the opposite of $(elem).is(sel)
[04:37:37] <xec_> .is() returns a boolean while .not() modifies the selection
[04:37:52] <Depth> okay .. o.o
[04:37:55] <Depth> thx :)
[04:37:58] <xec_> .filter() also modifies the selection. like not() only opposite
[04:38:44] <zsoc> ugh this is driving me nuts... what happens if you .append by id identifier a div that is display:hidden... does it stay hidden?
[04:39:11] <johnkpaul> zsoc: display:hidden isn't a valid property
[04:39:23] <johnkpaul> display:none is probably what you want
[04:39:26] <johnkpaul> or visibility:hidden
[04:39:38] <zsoc> sorry, it's display none
[04:40:08] <zsoc> i have a div that i'm trying to get to $('body').append on .mouseenter of another div
[04:40:30] <johnkpaul> jquery doesn't change the styles of an element when appending happens
[04:42:01] <zsoc> hmm.. ok thank you. i ask because this is an existing library and from what i can tell. there's no way this should work lol
[04:44:34] <xec_> zsoc: what you've said so far doesn't make a lot of sense, have any specific details or a use case?
[04:44:46] <zsoc> 1 sec
[04:44:53] <Depth> can I hide someway all these status-information like someone quit?
[04:45:04] <Depth> it makes following really hard
[04:46:35] <xec_> Depth: most irc clients will allow you to hide messages, but really depends on your client. personally i just have them styled differently (gray)
[04:47:02] <xec_> so i don't try to write messages to people that have quit etc ;)
[04:48:28] <Depth> okay .. i only use the webchat .. which client do you prefer?
[04:50:12] <hooloovoo> Depth: irssi is great
[04:50:26] <xec_> Depth: i'm not very hardcore so i just use mIRC on windows. and Limechat on my mac
[04:51:00] <xec_> Depth: xchat is another option if you want a free client
[04:55:48] <blackspotwiggins> xec_, xchat is not free in windows iirc
[04:55:56] <blackspotwiggins> but it's great otherwise
[04:56:29] <xec_> oh really?
[04:58:03] <blackspotwiggins> xec_, yea http://xchat.org/windows/
[05:00:46] <Depth> how to register an account here?
[05:01:50] <xec_> Depth: try typing /msg nickserv help
[05:02:42] <Lindrian> Okay. I am through jquery passing a php script values through ajax. These are utf-8 chars (Â‰ˆ and other). When I get the value back from php, it's all weird and stuff (√§ etc). Is this a problem in my php script or in jquery sending the request? I have saved both files as utf-8, my html header is utf-8 and i set a utf-8 header in the php script
[05:02:44] <xec_> blackspotwiggins: that's weird, i could have sworn i had used it for free before, could have been less than 30 days then i guess, or maybe on a linux box =/
[05:03:29] <blackspotwiggins> xec_, it's free everywhere else
[05:03:46] <xec_> i see. thanks
[05:04:20] <blackspotwiggins> Lindrian, can you confirm the correct header in firebug?
[05:04:43] <Lindrian> im using chrome, sec
[05:05:32] <Lindrian> i can see the characters are weird in the response.
[05:07:07] <Lindrian> its sending it as text/plain, blackspotwiggins
[05:07:34] <Lindrian> <span title=\"&Atilde;&curren;\">\u00e4<\/span>
[05:07:43] <Lindrian> Thats a real life example
[05:08:09] <Lindrian> Under 'request headers' i see Accept-Charset:ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3 though
[05:08:12] <Lindrian> which looks wrong.
[05:08:23] <Lindrian> Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
[05:08:43] <Lindrian> Response headers says Content-Encoding:UTF-8
[05:09:01] <Lindrian> So it seems like jquery is not sending it in utf-8??
[05:09:23] <blackspotwiggins> it's possible
[05:09:32] <blackspotwiggins> but the server returns utf-8
[05:10:01] <blackspotwiggins> not sure about php, maybe you have to manually encode the characters?
[05:11:09] <Lindrian> blackspotwiggins: i want it in utf-8
[05:11:11] <Depth> Test
[05:11:16] <Lindrian> the server returns utf-8 which is correct
[05:11:22] <Depth> Woop .. It works! :D

[05:22:59] <airdem> hi, any ideas why the ui tabs are not working here? http://zumweinbergkronberg.de/uberuns
[05:33:18] <msiao_> can jquery be used to split up a non-bitmat website into a 2d array or sorts
[05:33:28] <msiao_> so that sections can be animated in like a grid
[05:33:32] <msiao_> or is that impossible
[05:35:51] <pachet> what the devil is non-bitmat
[05:35:58] <msiao_> i mean like
[05:36:19] <msiao_> the content is made from divs and text
[05:36:29] <msiao_> you cant just split up an image to make the effect
[05:36:31] <vl1234> i have doubt about remember password in webpage. I dont know how to do.......
[05:36:41] <vl1234> any 1 have idea about this
[05:36:46] <vl1234> please let me know
[05:36:55] <vl1234> am not getting any of result
[05:40:18] <hooloovoo> vl1234: What are you talking about?
[05:42:32] <zsoc> http://conceptlogic.com/jcart/standalone-demo/ <-- so that is the demo page for jcart. when you click "Add you cart" you get a little tool tip by your mouse pointer. But if you look, the tooltip div is 'display:none', and the js (if you inspect resources) does not remove that property anywhere. It just appends the tooltip div (by id) to ('body') ..but when i click, the display changes to block... and ii'm not sure how

[05:44:54] <pachet> jammsen: watch the issue tracker and use another browser in the meantime?
[05:45:09] <jammsen> pachet: so its a browser error not js?
[05:45:17] <vl1234> @hooloovoo ........if am click Remember password check box.......how will store in cookies
[05:45:42] <vl1234> am completly new for this
[05:45:56] <vl1234> i dont know wt to do and how to do
[05:49:13] <hooloovoo> vl1234: hmm.. well you can use the jquery cookie plugin and do something like if ( $("input.rememberpass:checked").length ) { $.cookie("rememberpass", "<password>") }
[05:49:22] <hooloovoo> and then just get it out if it exists
[05:49:29] <hooloovoo> i don't think it's a safe way of doing it tho
[05:50:13] <pachet> hell no its not
[05:50:16] <vl1234> k which is safe way.....i will do
[05:50:17] <pachet> please don't do this
[05:50:27] <vl1234> @hooloovoo ........k which is safe way.....i will do
[05:50:27] <b-ot> vl1234, memorised ‚Äúwhich‚Äù.
[05:50:31] <blackspotwiggins> are you crazy? storing passwords in cookies?
[05:50:47] <vl1234> no passwor....only name
[05:50:50] <vl1234> user name
[05:51:12] <blackspotwiggins> please research how authentication actually works before doing something colossaly stupid
[05:51:28] <Julien_> Hello
[05:51:31] <pachet> hi
[05:52:00] <vl1234> @blackspotwiggines.......am searched lot but did not get any thing,,,,,,,,that y am askin
[05:52:01] <astropirate> give me your passwords
[05:52:05] <astropirate> i will tell you if it is secure
[05:52:06] <astropirate> :)
[05:52:08] <Julien_> I wonder why this plugin code begin with a semilicon ... mistake or syntax trick i don't know ? : http://higginsforpresident.net/js/static/jq.pubsub.js
[05:52:10] <jammsen> pachet: i dont get it fully, which issue tracker should i watch, js? firefox? please explain a little bit more :X
[05:52:11] <hooloovoo> astropirate: =D
[05:52:56] <hooloovoo> Julien_: it's a best practice thing
[05:53:11] <vl1234> @hooloovoo ........am not understand this......can u explain $.cookie("rememberpass", "<password>") this
[05:53:11] <b-ot> vl1234, insane http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&_trksid=p4340.l2557&item=300736846867&nma=true&pt=FR_Jeux_Vid&rt=nc&si=GbeKcy3NKVctlGzjZmMP5vXMExs%3D&orig_cvip=true#ht_162510wt_1037
[05:53:12] <blackspotwiggins> Julien_, if it's concat-ed before a badly written js, it doesnt break too bad
[05:53:20] <hooloovoo> Julien_: if there's a script above it that ends without a semi-colon that thing ends it.
[05:53:57] <hooloovoo> vl1234: don't use that =P
[05:54:14] <vl1234> @hooloovoo .......any problem on that
[05:54:19] <pachet> jammsen: its a firefox issue
[05:54:26] <hooloovoo> vl1234: lots of problem on that, yes.
[05:54:38] <pachet> jammsen: from what i can tell that comp error doesnt break execution, but i may be wrong
[05:54:49] <jammsen> pachet: so its new in 14.0.1 -.-
[05:54:54] <jammsen> in 13 it wasnt
[05:54:58] <vl1234> @hooloovoo .......then how ill store user name in cookies
[05:55:00] <Julien_> blackspotwiggins: hooloovoo so you think it's a mistake, thanks :)
[05:55:11] <blackspotwiggins> Julien_, nah its a precaution
[05:55:19] <hooloovoo> Julien_: just leave it there =)
[05:55:30] <hooloovoo> vl1234: you shouldn't
[05:55:56] <pachet> jammsen: well, that error code has been around for a long time actually - but the circumstances causing it to appear in your script may only have become an issue in your build
[05:56:00] <Julien_> oooooooook i understand, thanks a lot :)
[05:56:04] <pachet> jammsen: i'm not a spidermonkey expert so i can't say for sure
[05:56:46] <hooloovoo> vl1234: since security and stuff is tricky and it's really bad if it doesn't work you shouldn't make that stuff until youre confortable doing it without asking for help =P
[05:56:50] <vl1234> @hooloovoo .......then gmail remember check box are how its workin
[05:57:02] <jammsen> pachet: what would be the normal way to exclude that error? you know that?
[05:57:36] <vl1234> @hooloovoo .....no way to do ha?
[05:57:57] <Drager> Anyone here use jquerytools?
[05:58:08] <Drager> The tooltip
[05:58:45] <blackspotwiggins> vl1234, you generally store session information on serverside and only use a hash in the cookies
[05:58:59] <blackspotwiggins> which you check for every request
[05:59:00] <kwession> I have a question: I am using the script from http://jbdes.net/dev/js/fontsize.html to get text to scale to the width of a div on my website, but in firefox it seems to scale to the width of the entire page. why is that?
[05:59:06] <blackspotwiggins> and change, if you want to stay secure
[05:59:18] <hooloovoo> vl1234: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4538226/how-does-the-remember-my-password-checkbox-work
[05:59:30] <blackspotwiggins> and you most definitely dont store it using js
[06:03:19] <pachet> jammsen: not sure - can you post the line that throws the error? my hunch is that the domwindow instance isnt being initialized
[06:03:46] <jammsen> i dont get a sourcefile
[06:03:57] <jammsen> [14:42] jammsen: Timestamp: 23.07.2012 14:39:52 Error: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMWindow.content] Sourcefile:  Row: 231

[06:04:09] <jammsen> and it runs 11 times on 1 load
[06:06:10] <jammsen> pachet: 2 times browser restart and now its gone -.- what the hell ...
[06:06:40] <pachet> jammsen: yeah, dunno
[06:07:08] <pachet> jammsen: i recommend asking at irc.mozilla.org #bugzilla or #sunbird
[06:07:19] <pachet> er, #songbird
[06:07:27] <pachet> they'll be able to give you more targetted info
[06:07:34] <jammsen> i only use FF because of webdeveloper
[06:07:44] <jammsen> but now its for chrome avail
[06:07:48] <jammsen> maybe i change
[06:07:50] <jammsen> :O
[06:08:03] <jammsen> faster, less buggy and dont crashs so often
[06:08:46] <EnginA> why is jq channel is 833 people and ext js is 64 ? :)
[06:10:03] <pachet> EnginA: how often do you see job listings specify ext.js over jquery?
[06:10:43] <quicksilver> because jq is so much harder to use that 10x as many people have to ask about it?
[06:11:05] <EnginA> pachet: i don't look for jobs often
[06:11:07] <blackspotwiggins> more like #jquery is a noobmagnet :)
[06:11:12] <kwession> I have a question: I am using the script from http://jbdes.net/dev/js/fontsize.html to get text to scale to the width of a div on my website - fiddle.jshell.net/5V2yS/show/ , but in firefox it seems to scale to the width of the entire page. why is that?
[06:11:25] <pachet> because jq is so much easier to use that 10x as many people feel like using it even though they have no idea what they're doing
[06:11:26] <EnginA> but ext js looks like very the complete professional solution
[06:11:31] <pachet> er, what blackspotwiggins said
[06:11:36] <EnginA> where as jq has almost no learning curve and dead easy to use
[06:12:13] <EnginA> the thing is ext js has an unbelievable set of widgets
[06:12:19] <EnginA> so, I'd liketo give it a try
[06:12:31] <kwession> well, I don't know anything about it and I got jq to do what i want on my website
[06:12:34] <Drager> Anyone here use jquerytools? The tooltip?
[06:12:39] <kwession> only in firefox it doesn't work
[06:12:43] <EnginA> then, I checked the drag-n-drop documentation it was telling me to add boiler-plate code for some common routine... which is very lame
[06:12:53] <Drager> The site is currently down so I cant find any docs about it..
[06:12:56] <EnginA> JQ lacks UI gravely
[06:13:49] <EnginA> Drager: not here, http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/guide/drag_and_drop
[06:14:43] <Drager> EnginA: Is that for jquerytools?
[06:15:34] <blackspotwiggins> EnginA, jq is not an UI library
[06:15:42] <blackspotwiggins> it's not supposed to be
[06:16:07] <blackspotwiggins> ext is a complete solution, but it's also extremely bloated if you only want decent ajax for example
[06:16:30] <kwession> I have a question: I am using the script from http://jbdes.net/dev/js/fontsize.html to get text to scale to the width of a div on my website - http://jsfiddle.net/5V2yS/ , but in firefox it seems to scale to the width of the entire page. it works fine in safari and chrome. why is that?
[06:18:29] <pachet> kwession: not sure what i should be seeing, but it looks the same in chrome and firefox for me
[06:18:56] <EnginA> blackspotwiggins: jq-ui, i meant.
[06:19:11] <kwession> pachet: try the output frame only: http://fiddle.jshell.net/5V2yS/show/
[06:19:17] <EnginA> jq is awesome, we all know that, but a complete widget set is necessary to build useful applications
[06:19:21] <blackspotwiggins> EnginA, yea, i sort of agree with you there
[06:19:24] <EnginA> so jq should provide a supported ui toolkit
[06:19:40] <blackspotwiggins> in a sense that jqui could be better
[06:19:47] <blackspotwiggins> but you dont _need_ ui toolkits
[06:19:49] <EnginA> dude, it's like a toy
[06:19:52] <EnginA> check ext js
[06:20:02] <EnginA> mind blowingly well working results
[06:20:05] <kwession> pachet: I run firefox 13.0.1 on mac os x 10.7.4
[06:21:34] <pachet> kwession: again, looks the same. FF11 though, osx 10.7.4
[06:22:13] <kwession> what does it to if you resize your window width and reload? the text is supposed to scale to the divs width
[06:22:43] <Crimlo> where the hoes at?
[06:22:53] <pachet> kwession: resizing properly in both browsers - fits snugly in the window
[06:23:07] <kwession> hmmmm
[06:23:40] <pachet> Crimlo: homedepot.com
[06:23:53] <kwession> pachet: http://i.imgur.com/ErmKf.png this is what firefox puts out here

[06:25:03] <pachet> kwession : http://i.imgur.com/VcNNr.png
[06:25:32] <kwession> pachet: it is supposed to fit to the left div only
[06:25:59] <Crimlo> whats suppose to fit in the left div?
[06:26:39] <kwession> pachet: suddenly it doesn't work anymore even in chrome
[06:26:54] <kwession> Crimlo: the text in my page
[06:27:08] <kwession> Crimlo: http://fiddle.jshell.net/5V2yS/show/

[06:30:57] <Crimlo> oh come on, no need to be a dick!
[06:31:32] <kwession> pachet: Crimlo: something strange in chrome: it formats the text wrong when I reload on f5, but it's correct when I click in the url bar and hit enter.
[06:32:49] <Crimlo> ok you want to do what exactly?... center the text?
[06:33:03] <hlveheart> <center> the text </center> :)
[06:33:21] <hlveheart> that poor tag doesn't get used enough
[06:33:23] <Crimlo> why do people complicate things for themselves
[06:33:34] <hlveheart> lol
[06:33:47] <hrwath> yeah, better get a hoe and relax ;-)
[06:33:55] <Crimlo> dude you are going about it all wrong

[06:34:24] <kwession> crimlo: I want the text to fit its size to the divs width
[06:34:43] <hlveheart> what's the text wrapped in, kwession?
[06:34:45] <Crimlo> dude thats so simple
[06:34:58] <kwession> using this jq http://jbdes.net/dev/js/fontsize.html
[06:35:00] <jeffsmykil> is there an easier way to find if something is in an array than doing a for loop?

[06:56:12] <Crimlo> dude you are complicating things
[06:56:22] <kwession> am I
[06:56:25] <Crimlo> yes
[06:56:47] <kwession> So, there must be a simpler way to do the same thing
[06:56:55] <kwession> enlighten me :)
[06:57:16] <Crimlo> you'll have to give me a few, i currently doing something

[07:02:23] <LemmingMatt> gellis: you need to get rid of ajax call: http://jsfiddle.net/g9B8G/
[07:03:33] <gellis11> LemmingMatt: I need the ajax call as it deletes from the database
[07:03:40] <Crimlo> member:kwession are you on skype?
[07:04:17] <gellis11> it works fine on Chrome, but not IE9. It 'works' as in it deletes it from the database but doesnt slideup to remove it on the page
[07:05:06] <LemmingMatt> I mean just for the fiddle to work, there's no delete.php on jsfiddle's server
[07:06:58] <gellis11> yeah
[07:07:04] <gellis11> thanks for fixing the fiddle
[07:16:17] <woopawoop> hey, what's the right syntax to trigger a button on the parent while in an iframe? eg $(this).parent().$('#id').trigger('click')
[07:21:34] <M1k1> guys
[07:21:37] <M1k1> when come jquery 1.8?
[07:27:53] <Depth> Hey
[07:28:07] <Depth> Do you also support normal javascript? Or only jquery? =/
[07:29:49] <johnkpaul> Depth: there's ##javascript for javascript
[07:30:05] <Depth> oh, nice! thank you very much!
[07:30:24] <alexr2> i'm trying to load an iframe dynamically, and set the iframe width/height to the content width/height that's inside the iframe.  is there any way to do that gracefully?
[07:30:51] <eduardosouza> hey guys how are you? I have a div and I can change the background image of that div when I click on it, but how can I revert back to the original image when the user click again on the same div? So basically I would like the toggle effect with the click event. Suggestions?
[07:31:18] <alexr2> eduardosouza, toggleClass and have the class change your background color
[07:32:24] <eduardosouza> it is an image, and the problem is that the image that is been displayed when the div loads stays on top of the new one.
[07:34:00] <Zhy> wrap 2 divs, one with the 1st and one with the 2nd image, inside another div (which would be the one being clicked) , start with the 2nd div being not visible and toggle both visibilites upon click on the wrapper
[07:35:40] <eduardosouza> Ok thanks guys. One more thing, When I do that I am trying to check a checkbox element that has a proprety of display none to 	$("#chkbx1").attr('checked', true); will that work?
[07:39:35] <eduardosouza> So $("#div").click(function() {}, function() {}); will not work?
[07:45:29] <Cameron__> how do i get a sliced elemets html values?
[07:54:27] <some_dude> hai
[07:57:22] <some_dude> jq validate plugin, method errorPlacement: function(error, element){...     are error and element standard jquery objects?
[08:03:39] <mister_m> are there any known issues with the jquery UI datepickers in safari mobile?
[08:14:24] <eduardosouza> $("#chkbx1").attr('checked', true); will that work? of course that #chkbx1 is a input type checkbox
[08:19:29] <some_dude> eduardosouza: sure
[08:21:43] <eduardosouza> some_dude: Thank You, but it is not working... This input has the property of none on css, and I would like to be able to check this checkbox when I click on a div.
[08:22:00] <msiao_> http://misao.me/ firefox doesnt render this well at all xD
[08:22:08] <eduardosouza> some_dude: https://gist.github.com/9699ed48e40f247d59f8
[08:22:52] <HassanS> eduardosouza I think you want .attr('checked', 'checked')
[08:24:03] <blackspotwiggins> eduardosouza, use .prop() not .attr()
[08:25:26] <eduardosouza> blackspotwiggins: Prop did not work. It just worked with attr. But now If I click the div again I would like to uncheck
[08:26:57] <HassanS> use the he's right you should use prop http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[08:27:22] <HassanS> i think you use true/false booleans with .prop()
[08:28:22] <some_dude> eduardosouza: you got a typo. it's not atrr() but attr()
[08:28:28] <eduardosouza> HassanS: yeah well its not working...
[08:29:32] <HassanS> well if attr() is working for you
[08:29:52] <HassanS> and to change the checked value I would do something like:
[08:30:40] <eduardosouza> some_dude: Yeah I fix that, it channges the property of the input checkbox now. But for some reason I can't check for ("#chkbx1)is(":checked")
[08:31:17] <HassanS> there is a method .checked
[08:31:31] <HassanS> just do $('#chkbx1').checked
[08:31:35] <HassanS> it will return true or false
[08:32:34] <HassanS> have you checked out the api doc page for .prop()? it talks a lot about this stuff
[08:34:41] <xid> is there a quicker solution to each() over every cell in an 800 row table looking for existence of a string
[08:34:44] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying to render a handlebar temple, http://jsfiddle.net/ZyJKV/1/ but I'm only wanting it to render once the ajax rqeuest has finished
[08:35:28] <EyePulp> xid: grab the innerHTML and do a regex?
[08:35:51] <xid> :contains selector isn't working for me...
[08:36:00] <NoiseEee> xid: a good question to ask yourself would be "why am i showing 800 table rows"
[08:36:12] <xid> it's a third-party app
[08:36:12] <EyePulp> heh
[08:36:16] <xid> that's why
[08:36:30] <red5_> hi ! i'd like to know if have problem when i use :hover on IE7 with jquery's version 1.5.1 ?
[08:37:13] <eduardosouza> HassanS: Yes I did, I will look again. I have the following schenario, user is presented with 3 checkboxes, I am trying to make them a nicer looking checkbox, so I replaced the checkbox with a div with a image of a checkbox. So when the user clicks on the div (checkbox) it should change the status of the hidden checkbox associated with and display the div.
[08:37:40] <xid> also, why doesn't $('body').load(function(){alert('hi')}); work
[08:37:48] <xid> there's definitely a body
[08:37:59] <xid> $('body').click(function(){alert('hi')}); works fine
[08:39:07] <xid> I know load() is for requests
[08:39:17] <gmurphey> xid: $('body') doesn't have a `load` event.
[08:39:18] <xid> but can't it also be used to detect the event of an object loading into the document?
[08:39:22] <xid> oh
[08:39:25] <maltray> Hello guys, Im trying to make an uploader with a progress bar (right now im using jquery file uploader https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/), thing is that I'm not getting a progress bar on IE, is there a workaround for this?
[08:39:29] <gmurphey> xid: ?load
[08:39:54] <xid> so $('table').load(function(){alert('hi')}); shoulld work then
[08:39:56] <xid> but it doesn't
[08:40:13] <Brodingo> window has a load event
[08:40:20] <NoiseEee> xid: no, it shouldn't work.
[08:40:28] <Brodingo> also, load(url) is being deprecated
[08:40:29] <xid> by ID selector?
[08:41:47] <gmurphey> ?load @ xid
[08:41:59] <bot-t> xid, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[08:42:11] <xid> yes, I know... :/
[08:42:21] <xid> not working on an ID selector
[08:42:24] <xid> what is the alternative?
[08:42:55] <Brodingo> xid, read the doc
[08:43:05] <Brodingo> This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, scripts, frames, iframes, and the window object.
[08:43:32] <xid> yes
[08:43:33] <xid> i know
[08:43:35] <xid> in my case
[08:43:37] <xid> it is a table
[08:43:44] <xid> and the event isn't firing
[08:43:47] <Brodingo> is a table in that list?
[08:43:48] <NoiseEee> is a table an image,script, frame, iframe or window object?
[08:44:13] <xid> hmm right
[08:44:16] <xid> thanks
[08:44:19] <xid> so
[08:44:22] <xid> suggest any alternative?
[08:44:33] <xid> or just continue making me feel dumb?
[08:44:37] <xid> take your pick
[08:45:20] <jedimind> anyone know if injecting conditional comments into the dom would actually work?
[08:45:22] <jedimind> im leaning towards no
[08:45:26] <xid> what's strange, is I swear this worked on divs before
[08:45:34] <xid> how the hell do I get a load type event on a div?
[08:45:37] <NoiseEee> xid: guarantee it did not.
[08:45:50] <xid> ok
[08:46:12] <Brodingo> try using the window load event, did you paste any code?
[08:47:27] <xid> yes $('#mytable').load(function(){dosomething()});
[08:47:34] <xid> that's the code i pastd
[08:47:36] <xid> essentially
[08:47:48] <xid> which doesn't work because load() only fires on URL associated elemnts
[08:48:08] <Brodingo> oh, well then just switch '#mytable' to window
[08:48:18] <Brodingo> what are you waiting to load exactly?
[08:48:34] <xid> sorry i'm being absolutely daft
[08:48:37] <xid> long morning
[08:49:03] <xid> I guess don't I don't need it to fire on load event
[08:49:13] <xid> other than $(document).ready
[08:49:18] <xid> so nevermind lol
[08:49:24] <Brodingo> ?cc
[08:49:24] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[08:50:20] <DukeDrake> hi
[08:51:26] <DukeDrake> how can I make a function wait for the answer of a $.post?
[08:52:14] <tamarche> What do you mean wait?
[08:52:33] <tamarche> Make it synchronous?
[08:52:35] <NoiseEee> DukeDrake: you fire that function it $.post's success callback.
[08:52:56] <DukeDrake> if I trigger a $.post() within a function
[08:53:00] <Brodingo> or use a promise?
[08:53:44] <DukeDrake> is something like "var waitvar = $.post(...)" possible?
[08:54:34] <DukeDrake> yes, I guess I need it synchronous?
[08:55:03] <NoiseEee> le sigh.
[08:55:39] <Brodingo> lolque
[08:55:48] <red5_> hi! i've this message"Syntax Error, unrecognized expression: hover" on ie8 using jquery 1.7.1 when i tried this $('my-class').find('li:hover')
[08:56:00] <red5_> could anyone help me !?
[08:56:18] <Brodingo> :hover is a css pseudo state
[08:57:59] <DukeDrake> NoiseEee: ?
[08:58:18] <xid> very strange, $('a').hide() works, but not $('a:contains("string")').hide()
[08:58:20] <DukeDrake> Setting async = false is deprecated ... what should I use instead?
[08:58:27] <scalex000> troll-boy, hi
[08:59:32] <tamarche> No
[08:59:44] <tamarche> DukeDrake: It will be deprecated in 1.8
[09:00:03] <tamarche> Current release is 1.7
[09:00:07] <DukeDrake> hm
[09:00:08] <tamarche> You can still use it
[09:00:20] <tamarche> A note
[09:00:21] <DukeDrake> it will be deprecated and there is no alternative yet?
[09:00:30] <DukeDrake> "thanx for the hint" ?
[09:00:31] <tamarche> I believe it freezes up the browser if you set that to true
[09:00:37] <tamarche> If it's a long wait
[09:01:49] <tamarche> xid: did you use firebug or anything
[09:01:55] <xid> yes
[09:01:57] <xid> no errors
[09:02:01] <xid> actually
[09:02:03] <xid> it works
[09:02:10] <tamarche> okay
[09:02:19] <xid> but only when i remove the selector before it that has an attribute seleector
[09:02:25] <xid> for the action= attribute
[09:02:35] <xid> $("form[action='UserSEditRecords.aspx'] table#RecordsGrid tbody tr td:contains('Update')").hide()
[09:02:42] <xid> it doesn't like that
[09:02:58] <xid> I can either remove the :contains, or the [action]
[09:03:01] <xid> and either works
[09:03:04] <xid> but not when both exist
[09:03:21] <xid> weird, right?
[09:04:23] <maltray> Since I couldnt find a solution to the jquery file upload progress bar, I'm now looking to simulate a progress bar based on the user's upstream
[09:04:24] <tamarche> That's funky
[09:04:37] <maltray> any way to check how much it's with javascript / jquery?
[09:05:14] <jedimind> you couldnt find a solution to a file upload status bar in jquery?
[09:05:20] <jedimind> did... did you try google ?
[09:05:20] <jedimind> i heard its good
[09:05:29] <maltray> status bar?
[09:05:32] <maltray> progress bar.
[09:05:49] <xid> i have also heard of google and i have found it to be good
[09:05:58] <maltray> and I've been googling for more hours that I can spend with this already
[09:06:01] <jedimind> maltray, like this: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ ?
[09:06:08] <xid> although sometimes it is not as reliable as word of mouth recommendations
[09:06:16] <xid> that actually happens very often
[09:06:21] <xid> to me for some reason
[09:06:29] <maltray> jedimind if u would have read what i said earlier
[09:06:34] <maltray> Hello guys, Im trying to make an uploader with a progress bar (right now im using jquery file uploader https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/), thing is that I'm not getting a progress bar on IE, is there a workaround for this?
[09:06:45] <NoiseEee> tamarche: the fact that you're recommending synchronous for xhr is mindblowing and dangerous
[09:07:03] <systemfault> maltray: Not really
[09:07:17] <yedimind> or swfupload
[09:07:21] <yedimind> as an alternative
[09:07:22] <tamarche> I'm not recommending it, I asked if he needed it to be synchronous.
[09:07:51] <tamarche> I didn't say to use it, I said that it's not deprecated yet and gave a warning about it too.
[09:08:42] <NoiseEee> tamarche: that is never the answer though... to have X follow Y, you use callbacks or promise(),  his problem has been solved a zillion times
[09:09:51] <tamarche> NoiseEee: So?
[09:10:32] <Brodingo> so spread the good word of async and callbacks?
[09:10:40] <tamarche> NoiseEee: I try to help, and whether or not the problem has been solved over and over is irrelevant to me.  I like to help.  If it's not the right way, say it in a more polite manner.
[09:11:20] <red5> is there some fallback for :hover using jquery ?
[09:11:57] <Brodingo> what are you trying to do red5
[09:12:25] <Brodingo> :hover is a css pseudo state, if youre trying to select hovered elements maybe try a hover class with .hover()
[09:13:11] <red5> Brodingo: i'm trying to use some like this $('.my-class').find('li:hover') but it doesn't work on IE7
[09:14:40] <supsup> you declare a doctype on the page?

[09:23:21] <tri> hi
[09:24:40] <tri> I use $.getJSON with a json url to get select options dynamically loaded. It works but only ones - the second time I open the dialog with the select box the url is requested but the options in the select box remaine the same? Only after the second or third try the select options get updated... - somebody have a idea how to solve this?
[09:31:46] <jeffreylevesque> I have a menu that toggles upon clicking the menu (One, Two, Three, Four).  However, i am trying to add a feature, that if you clicking anywhere outside the menu, it toggles.  Can someone help me: http://jsfiddle.net/Qm6Tc/10/
[09:36:50] <ryanneufeld> good morning
[09:37:26] <supsup> jeffrey what you say it toggles what toggles
[09:37:59] <jeffreylevesque> supsup: if you click "One"
[09:38:04] <macmartine> Anyone know why I can't access my jquery ui slider? https://gist.github.com/3164605
[09:38:05] <jeffreylevesque> that toggles links under it
[09:38:14] <supsup> so the one menu toggles?
[09:38:26] <jeffreylevesque> yeah
[09:38:34] <jeffreylevesque> this is a simplified version of my test site
[09:39:32] <jeffreylevesque> menu's only toggle when you click a menu item.. but I want to be able to click outside the menu and everything toggles away
[09:39:54] <shoky> jeffreylevesque: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Qm6Tc/13/
[09:40:21] <shoky> jeffisabelle: .attr('id','menu')  <--- sets the element's id to menu
[09:40:33] <shoky> oops wrong nick
[09:40:40] <jeffreylevesque> Thanks shoky
[09:45:04] <ryanneufeld> So I have a situation, where i need to test for the location of some elements on the page, in their relation to another
[09:45:20] <ryanneufeld> I can't go back and change the existing code
[09:45:33] <ryanneufeld> is there a way to test where in the dom the elements are?
[09:45:57] <shoky> you mean an absolute pixel value?
[09:46:24] <ryanneufeld> shoky: no, like a div that comes after a style tag, and before another div
[09:46:28] <ryanneufeld> I have ids for the divs
[09:46:43] <supsup> can use .find
[09:46:51] <supsup> ? .find()
[09:46:51] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[09:47:17] <supsup> with length
[09:47:27] <supsup> ? .length
[09:47:29] <bot-t> length: The number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/length/
[09:47:38] <shoky> ryanneufeld: you can use .find/.contains/.is etc..
[09:48:01] <ryanneufeld> I was gonna go down the route of children
[09:48:02] <shoky> oops contains is $.contains
[09:48:18] <supsup> think find is faster but not 100 percent.
[09:48:23] <supsup> sure
[09:48:30] <shoky> faster than what
[09:48:47] <supsup> .children then searching
[09:49:01] <shoky> really depends what he's doin
[09:49:20] <supsup> just do top level your looking for .find id that is a child, look at length to see if you found any if u did it exists as a child.
[09:49:47] <ryanneufeld> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/JgJmN/
[09:50:13] <ryanneufeld> supsup: I need to know _where_ it is
[09:50:15] <ryanneufeld> supsup: order matters
[09:50:40] <shoky> what exactly do you want to do with that
[09:51:02] <ryanneufeld> shoky: so we have a custom ad unit that loads a style tag, div, and script. In that order
[09:51:14] <ryanneufeld> the script can be anywhere
[09:51:25] <ryanneufeld> but the style and div need to be in a specific place
[09:51:42] <ryanneufeld> currently the ad is only shown in that specific place, but our trafficers want to move it
[09:52:05] <shoky> dont need the backstory. what do you want to do with the fiddle?
[09:52:37] <ryanneufeld> shoky: context is helpful in this case.  So sometimes the code could appear in the main div, or where it currently is
[09:52:56] <ryanneufeld> if it it's in the current location, I need to know
[09:53:20] <ryanneufeld> so I don't remove it and add it back to the same place
[09:53:26] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/JgJmN/1/ assuming you mean something like this
[09:53:28] <ryanneufeld> but if it's not in the current location, I need to move it
[09:53:31] <supsup> but yah just guessin
[09:53:54] <ryanneufeld> supsup: not quite
[09:54:17] <ryanneufeld> supsup: if I move the mustbeafterstyle to after main
[09:54:22] <shoky> ryanneufeld: i see 4 elements in the fiddle. one container div, one style, one #mustbeafterstyle and one #main
[09:54:24] <ryanneufeld> supsup: it will be teh same result
[09:54:36] <shoky> you want to validate that #mustbeafterstyle is after a <style> ?
[09:54:38] <supsup> you would make case
[09:54:40] <supsup> select
[09:54:43] <ryanneufeld> shoky: yes
[09:54:51] <ryanneufeld> and that it is before #main inside the parent div
[09:57:00] <shoky> so something like http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/JgJmN/2/ ?
[09:57:47] <ryanneufeld> shoky: hadn't looked at that way (which is why I'm in here asking for other ideas :)
[09:57:49] <supsup> why not just give the style tag id and  use insertafter?
[09:58:05] <ryanneufeld> supsup: I can't
[09:58:23] <ryanneufeld> supsup: I can't change the markup that is already there for existing ad units
[09:58:44] <supsup> will style tag always be closest to id main? if so can use closest
[09:59:12] <ryanneufeld> it will always be Style Div Script
[09:59:59] <ryanneufeld> hmm. then it should be header
[10:00:29] <ryanneufeld> it's always on the same site, that helps with it being predictable
[10:01:32] <jeffreylevesque> does anyone know how i can remove a slidetoggle from a DOM element after it happened?
[10:02:21] <supsup> ? .unbind()
[10:02:21] <bot-t> .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[10:03:27] <ryanneufeld> shoky: thanks for the help, I think I have a plan
[10:03:37] <ryanneufeld> I missed something important
[10:24:15] <garbagegod> How do I change the contents of a div based on the selection of a dropdown menu?
[10:25:38] <Brodingo> ?change @ garbagegod
[10:25:38] <bot-t> garbagegod, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[10:25:51] <Brodingo> ?val
[10:25:51] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[10:30:58] <JFranks> I'm looking for a nice way to have a stylized drop-down menu on a page making heavy use of jQuery and themes
[10:31:13] <LindsayMac> theres a million out there JFranks
[10:31:26] <JFranks> And not one you'd suggest. Cool. ;)
[10:32:56] <JFranks> A standard html <select> drop down is the most functional solution, jquery UI's widgets don't seem to have any replacement
[10:33:39] <JFranks> Best I can 'dream up' would be a dialog that loads on mouse over to offer some choices for the field, and unloads on mouse exit.. ;p
[10:34:40] <LindsayMac> i've been using twitter bootstrap for a lot of my UI needs paired with jqueryUI
[10:40:23] <JFranks> Aha.. This works well.. simple + theme support: http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/menus/flat.php#
[10:48:44] <LindsayMac> I am having something really strange happen. I have a container that is somehow getting a class added to it that shouldn't be. Its hard to explain, so if anyone's interested in helping out.. if you give my our IP I can give you access to the demo sit e
[10:50:59] <nkenealy> could someone take a quick look at www.ride411-phase3.com and mouseover any of the people on the home page using Firefox - see the new image overlay refreshing on and off
[10:52:53] <LindsayMac> nkenealy:  its just a quick flash
[10:53:40] <nkenealy> lindsaymac just wondering if you had  any ideas on how to debug it - I've tried removing js libs which I thought might be causing a conflict
[10:54:00] <LindsayMac> Sorry.. not really sure
[10:54:16] <nkenealy> LindsayMac: ok - thanks for looking
[10:54:49] <LindsayMac> nkenealy:  you should pull that code out of the markup though. Its hard to read..
[10:55:23] <LindsayMac> nkenealy:  also try mouseover instead of mousemove ..
[10:55:30] <jeffsmykil> anyone have experience with requestAnimationFrame?
[10:56:11] <nkenealy> LindsayMac: which code do you mean?
[10:56:26] <LindsayMac> nkenealy:  you have all of your javascript right in the <li> html markup
[10:57:10] <nkenealy> LindsayMac: ok - very good. I'll start there. I need to simplify all right - thanks
[10:57:39] <LindsayMac> definitely.. but try mouseover instead of mousemove
[10:58:08] <nkenealy> LindsayMac: OK I'll try that first now
[11:00:39] <FernandoBasso> I have this json data: {"0":"turma parceria teste","tur_nome":"turma parceria teste","1":"Som e Arte Aplicados na Psicomotricidade","dis_nome":"Som e Arte Aplicados na Psicomotricidade"}. It returns that when I use result.list - Now, how could I get the 'cur_nome', for instance, in that 'result.list' ?
[11:00:51] <FernandoBasso> result.list.cur_nome does not work...
[11:01:49] <shoky> tur or cur?
[11:01:58] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: i see "tur_nome" and "dis_nome" but not "cur_nome", how about you?
[11:02:02] <FernandoBasso> tur* sorry.
[11:02:20] <shoky> is it a json string or a javascript object
[11:02:45] <shoky> if it's a string you need to parse it first
[11:03:14] <FernandoBasso> It comes from result: = jQuery.parseJSON(dados);
[11:03:30] <shoky> is result.list a json string or an object/
[11:03:30] <shoky> ?
[11:03:31] <FernandoBasso> Where dados is an ajax response from a php application.
[11:03:32] <NoiseEee> "does not work..." means?
[11:03:43] <FernandoBasso> It means it returns nothing.
[11:03:44] <shoky> ok but what is result.list
[11:03:51] <shoky> a string or an object ?
[11:04:16] <FernandoBasso> I believe it is an an object, since I used jquery.parseJSON(dados);
[11:04:24] <shoky> that wouldn't matter
[11:04:39] <shoky> if the list property is a string
[11:04:48] <shoky> it wouldn't get parsed unless you specifically parse it
[11:05:13] <shoky> result is an object, yes. but result.list might not be
[11:05:23] <shoky> depends what your original json had
[11:08:01] <FernandoBasso> https://gist.github.com/3165063 <-- The ajax response.
[11:08:30] <shoky> see, it is a string
[11:08:35] <shoky> "listagem":"{\"
[11:09:35] <shoky> you need to parseJSON that string
[11:09:45] <FernandoBasso>  result = jQuery.parseJSON(dados);
[11:09:50] <FernandoBasso> That is what I did...
[11:09:55] <shoky> not that
[11:09:57] <shoky> that's fine
[11:10:04] <shoky> but then, result.listagem is a STRING
[11:10:19] <shoky> so if you want an object you'd need jQuery.parseJSON(result.listagem)
[11:10:44] <shoky> another parseJSON
[11:10:54] <NoiseEee> or send back something way more sensible
[11:10:57] <shoky> ^^
[11:12:24] <dokshor> oli
[11:12:50] <FernandoBasso> All right. Thank you guys.

[11:18:19] <ser_> este chat
[11:18:25] <eph3meral> how do I get the "html" of an element, including the html for that element itself
[11:18:30] <eph3meral> because e.g.
[11:18:55] <eph3meral> $('<strong>').html("Here's a message").html(); only returns the inner content of the <strong> element but not the html for the <strong> element itself
[11:18:58] <eph3meral> does that make sense?
[11:19:54] <troll-boy> ah.. weird
[11:20:36] <troll-boy> also.. you're setting and then getting the html there
[11:20:40] <troll-boy> you realize that right?
[11:22:08] <NoiseEee> eph3meral: $(el)[0].outerHTML;
[11:22:19] <kevinquinnyo> i'm using .load to load part of a form from another page on the site, and when i submit, it's trying to send the POST parameters to the current page.  is the only/best option:
[11:22:40] <kevinquinnyo> to use .click and .post and send the values and uri manually
[11:28:26] <voot545> jQueryUI's .resizable() is adjusting my width when I've not told it to; is there a better implementation anyone knows of?

[11:41:07] <duc_> hi
[11:41:55] <duc_> can i have the same div/whatever using -both- draggable and resizable from jquery-ui?
[11:42:28] <hlveheart> can anyone help me simplify my j
[11:42:30] <hlveheart> jQuery? * http://jsfiddle.net/5PX3t/5/
[11:42:52] <ha6aha6a> hello jQ friends. i am looking for a code snippet that would do something like a facebook notification when you get a msg on facebook or something else related to you happens. i am talking about the little red notification that says that you have 3 new msgs or 10 people want to be friends with you. i have googled but i can't find anything. i don't want that red notification specifically....
[11:42:54] <ha6aha6a> ...just something that makes something happen on the screen when something on the server happens.... any ideas please?
[11:45:35] <hlveheart> That's more so something that would be aimed at #css no?
[11:47:29] <NoiseEee> ha6aha6a: something like socket.io ... basically your browser has to be listening/capable of receiving notifications from the server and acting on them.
[11:48:09] <ha6aha6a> NoiseEee: socket.io. got it. i will look into it. thank you very much
[11:48:43] <hlveheart> are you talking about the function, or the notification itself? lol
[11:49:03] <hlveheart> also, anybody have any insight on how to simplify my jQ? http://jsfiddle.net/5PX3t/5/
[11:49:06] <Validatorian> Anyone know where I can find a competant JS dev (esp. for browser extension development) for some freelance work that is affordable on a boot-strap budget? I employed a freelancer out of Greece that was amazing, but he got hired away, so I'm looking for a replacement. If anyone is interested or knows someone who might be, please let me know
[11:50:29] <scriabin> having trouble with an observer: http://jsfiddle.net/GaLEX/ (granted, that's probably a stupid way to do this) - I want the selection of a radio button at the top to trigger the selection of "Testing system" down below.  But my '.selected = true' doesn't work.  Why?
[11:51:54] <NoiseEee> hlveheart: http://jsfiddle.net/5PX3t/6/
[11:53:13] <hlveheart> Thank you so much NoiseEee :}
[11:53:29] <NoiseEee> hlveheart: get the idea?
[11:54:39] <hlveheart> sure do, thank you very much :)
[11:55:46] <duc_> http://jsfiddle.net/TsGmD/
[11:55:53] <duc_> er wait
[11:57:26] <duc_> http://jsfiddle.net/TsGmD/1/
[11:57:35] <duc_> this is the demo from http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/#default
[11:57:37] <duc_> and it doesnt work
[11:57:40] <duc_> any ideas what am i missing?
[11:58:51] <ngharo> duc_: the css.
[11:58:59] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/TsGmD/2/
[11:59:39] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/TsGmD/3/ ** :P
[11:59:40] <duc_> uh? you didnt change anything
[11:59:56] <hlveheart> duc_, look at the CSS.
[12:00:05] <ngharo> duc_: linked to the css under "Manage Resources"
[12:00:23] <ngharo> why jsfiddle doesnt automatically do that is quite annoying
[12:00:49] <duc_> aw
[12:01:07] <hlveheart> lol
[12:04:08] <samuel02> can somebody explain why this doesn't work in IE9 - http://jsbin.com/welcome/2336/edit ??
[12:05:46] <hlveheart> Just worked for me in IE9...
[12:06:13] <hlveheart> o_O
[12:09:01] <kevinquinnyo> trying to find the documentation on variable interpolation, i'm trying to interpolate a variable in a quoted string
[12:09:10] <kevinquinnyo> inside a .load call
[12:09:37] <kevinquinnyo> "/some/local/path/something.php?something=MY_VAR_HERE"
[12:11:42] <jpcody> hey all, is there a known workaround for an inability to register a click handler on an image nested in a button in IE 7/8: http://jsfiddle.net/t2uYr/
[12:12:09] <NoiseEee> jpcody: why wouldnt you put the handler on the button itsef?
[12:12:32] <someprimetime> how can I bind two variables with bind()? var1 = $('#foo'), var2 = $('#bar');
[12:12:38] <someprimetime> $(var1, var2)?
[12:12:45] <jpcody> in actuality, what I'm doing is a button that is a call-to-action that contains a drop down arrow to reveal more actions. like so: http://d.pr/i/PJ7E
[12:12:47] <someprimetime> $(var1, var2).bind()?
[12:13:17] <red5> i'd like to know if have some issue relative a "Stackoverflow" on IE7 with ajax calling ?
[12:13:30] <NoiseEee> jpcody: awful things to be used inside a <button>
[12:14:27] <jpcody> NoiseEee: you mean images are awful things to be used inside a button?
[12:14:35] <NoiseEee> jpcody: for the most part, yeah.
[12:14:52] <NoiseEee> jpcody: either use an image, or css, or from what it looks like you want to do, a <select> with an onchange listener
[12:15:18] <jpcody> fair enough. i'll just give an effort to changing the markup pattern.
[12:15:19] <jpcody> thanks!
[12:15:21] <NoiseEee> np
[12:15:45] <samuel02> hlveheart, really!? Do you get the alert?
[12:16:16] <kevinquinnyo> ahhh i figured mine out, "/path/so/file.php" + variable + "rest of query parameters"  <-- is that the best way to do variable interpolation?
[12:17:18] <ui_> http://hydrogen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/wiki/index.php/PHP_Variable_Interpolation
[12:17:49] <remysharp> samuel02: alerts are removed from the "live" rendering, if you want to see them, click on the "run with JS" (it used to say "run with alerts" but it didn't make a whole lot of sense until you specifically fell victim to that problem)
[12:19:09] <someprimetime> remysharp in the house?
[12:19:11] <someprimetime> fuckyeah
[12:19:19] <someprimetime> nice job on the new jsbin
[12:19:46] <remysharp> someprimetime: cheers. Lots of work went in over the last few months. Big credit to my Node and UX guys too
[12:20:06] <duc_> i have a <div><font>text</font></div> - i want the <font>'s font-size to be scaled up and down in accordance to the <div>, like, be the largest possible within the div. how do i do that?
[12:21:20] <JFranks> So I needed some drop-downs in a table.. Found this: http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/menus/flat.php .. modified the .js for <span>s vs. <a>s and it works just the way I want, until I add it to the table with multiple rows, and then only the first item is responding to clicks..
[12:22:22] <ui_> duc_: font is deprecated, replace with <span style="">
[12:22:59] <duc_> ui_ same same. how do i do what i wanted?
[12:23:24] <someprimetime> @remysharp the link to github in the How You Can Contribute header doesn't navigate me away from the page
[12:23:25] <kevinquinnyo> ui_: i wasnt asking about php variable interpolation
[12:24:04] <ui_> duc_: font-size? http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-size.asp
[12:24:07] <samuel02> remysharp, well the code is just a short example of some code I'm developing and the binding to 'shown' action doesn't work in ie9
[12:24:20] <samuel02> remysharp, it works fine in chrome though
[12:24:46] <duc_> ui_ no, i used jquery-ui resizable on the div - but i want the font-size to be scaled accordingly, to be the largest possible within that div
[12:24:55] <remysharp> samuel02: actually because the alert doesn't happen during the init of your app - it should appear. Can you file a bug? Might be us, might not be.
[12:24:59] * tw2113 saw a lot of activity on github from remysharp 
[12:25:04] <kevinquinnyo> ui_: was talking about js interpolation, like .load( "/something.php?foo=" + variable " #somediv" )
[12:25:10] <hlveheart> shoky!
[12:25:13] <remysharp> someprimetime: I'll check that out
[12:25:15] <hlveheart> I have the biggest favor to ask you.
[12:25:22] <kevinquinnyo> i'm missing a + there, oops
[12:25:27] <hlveheart> like always. :).
[12:25:58] <samuel02> remysharp, do you think it's related to ie9 or chrome? check this in chrome and ie9: http://jsbin.com/welcome/2336
[12:26:15] <samuel02> remysharp, sorry I meant, related to jquery or bootstrap?
[12:26:21] <JFranks> Ahhh, yeah so if I use http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/menus/flat.php in a table it binds to the first element that matches the id and doesn't apply itself to the rest of the elements.. Would it be really hard to fix this behavior?
[12:26:41] <voot545> .resizable() is causing my element to get wider by 30px or so
[12:26:41] <b-ot> voot545, it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[12:26:59] <samuel02> hlveheart, did you really get the alert in ie9 on this page: http://jsbin.com/welcome/2336
[12:27:08] <kevinquinnyo> ui_: for the record, was wondering if what i was doing was a "hack" and there was a better way, but from what i can tell it's standard practice, so i'm good ;)
[12:27:08] <hlveheart> oh, no alert. I got the modal though
[12:27:14] <hlveheart> One sec. samuel02
[12:27:30] <brettfrable> Hey guys
[12:27:30] <hlveheart> Can you mock it on jsfiddle.net real quick?
[12:27:33] <hlveheart> It's easier to debug
[12:27:41] <remysharp> lol
[12:27:45] <brettfrable> I'm using ajax for some pagination
[12:28:02] <brettfrable> but I'm trying to load SOME of the content from a page into a specific section
[12:28:05] <brettfrable> not the entire page.
[12:28:12] <brettfrable> i'm new at this - but is this possible
[12:29:05] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/tvkS6/ samuel02, give me a sec. Looking at the code.
[12:29:40] <samuel02> hlveheart, thanks
[12:29:51] <hlveheart> yep
[12:30:00] <remysharp> hlveheart: I'm genuinely curious, how is it easier to debug in jsfiddle (when you're done of course)?
[12:32:07] <hlveheart> remysharp, I hate anything besides. That's why.
[12:32:14] <hlveheart> There's no real reason, I'm used to using one tool ;)
[12:36:50] <remysharp> hlveheart: that's a good enough reason :)
[12:37:19] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/tvkS6/ samuel02, you're using bootstrap, why are you using 'shown'?
[12:39:50] <itatitat> guys I've a problem with this code, is not working, is a simple ajax, very simple
[12:40:12] <samuel02> hlveheart, I have to in the callback I'm doing stuff that is relying on the modal div being entirely visible
[12:40:27] <samuel02> hlveheart, I missed on comma
[12:40:29] <samuel02> one
[12:40:30] <hlveheart> :s
[12:41:16] <samuel02> hlveheart, but it should work? it's a modal event - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
[12:42:35] <itatitat> http://snipt.org/vrjc9#expand
[12:43:26] <hlveheart> ah, guess i just never used shown lol
[12:43:27] <hlveheart> My bad
[12:46:17] <ui_> itatitat: put jQuery.click and the folloowing ( on the same line
[12:47:18] <samuel02> hlveheart, np, why does it fail though? what do you think it's related to? since it works fine in chrome, and I assume firefox
[12:47:27] <itatitat> wow!, you are a genious
[12:47:36] <itatitat> thanks a lot
[12:50:14] <jeffsmykil> how do you send to parameters inbedded in an onclick statement when it is being written to a variable first
[12:50:37] <jeffsmykil> and if you understand that question you are brilliant
[12:51:23] <tri> I have a select box which gets it content through getJSON. But this only works the first time - why? If I open the select box the options aren't updated?
[12:51:32] <Brodingo> jeffsmykil it sounds pretty dumb to me
[12:52:42] <jeffsmykil> Brodingo html += '<input class="button orange" type="button" value="Edit" onclick="FacilityGroups.showEditFacilityGroupDialog(' + f[i].FacilityGroupId + ')"/>;
[12:52:47] <jeffsmykil> that works
[12:52:55] <hlveheart> :|
[12:52:56] <jeffsmykil> trying to add a second parameter cant get the syntax right
[12:53:06] <Brodingo> gross
[12:53:08] <hlveheart> "Don't paste code in the channel. Please use JSFiddle.net"
[12:53:08] <hlveheart> sir
[12:53:09] <hlveheart> >:/
[12:53:16] <jeffsmykil> ... over one line of code
[12:53:28] <Brodingo> yeah one line is no biggie
[12:54:39] <samuel02> tri, code? probably has to do with caching
[12:54:43] <hlveheart> >:
[12:54:48] <samuel02> hlveheart, any solution?
[12:54:51] <hlveheart> jeffisabelle, relax. it was a joke. Hence the >:/
[12:55:05] <hlveheart> samuel02, hold on. Was taking care of something else real quick lol
[12:55:07] <hlveheart> I'm at work
[12:55:07] <hlveheart> :P
[12:55:34] <samuel02> hlveheart, haha I see, thanks!¬®
[12:59:44] <someprimetime> is it possible to chain these: $successIcon.hide(); $errorIcon.hide(); ?
[13:00:44] <Justus> hi, how can I catch a change of an accordion()?
[13:00:59] <Justus> I didn't find a n option for that one
[13:01:34] <NoiseEee> someprimetime: $('#firstID, #secondID').hide();
[13:01:39] <NoiseEee> someprimetime: if thats what you mean?
[13:01:45] <troll-boy> Justus, one sec
[13:01:49] <someprimetime> NoiseEee: yeah but would it be possible to cache them and then chain them?
[13:01:55] <someprimetime> or do i have to have the selector in there
[13:02:05] <NoiseEee> someprimetime: $(ref1,ref2).hide()  ??
[13:02:12] <someprimetime> NoiseEee: ah that's it
[13:02:13] <someprimetime> thank you sir
[13:02:18] <troll-boy> Justus, http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#event-change
[13:02:29] <zap0> how does that on-view image loading thingy work?     only loads images when <img> is visible
[13:02:45] <Justus> thank you troll-boy :)
[13:03:23] <troll-boy> Justus, when in doubt, check the events tab.. the jquery ui docs are pretty awesome
[13:03:42] <samuel02> hlveheart, ie9 doesn't support css transitions, right? does it have anything to do with this - https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-modal.js#L72 ?
[13:03:45] <Justus> it's a bit hard to get around, I was looking only at the option tabs *sigh*
[13:03:52] <Justus> I'm coming over from ExtJS
[13:03:59] <hlveheart> I was actually thinking it had to do something more with your doctype.
[13:04:22] <NoiseEee> someprimetime: ref1,ref2.hide()  <--
[13:05:21] <samuel02> hlveheart, really? how?
[13:07:21] <samuel02> hlveheart, it must have to do with the transition. the 'shown' event is only triggered if transition is supported
[13:08:51] <hlveheart> AH WAIT
[13:08:52] <hlveheart> I have it
[13:08:53] <hlveheart> ONe sec.
[13:08:53] <hlveheart> :)

[13:12:26] <brettfrable> hey guys*
[13:12:32] <brettfrable> when you go through the pager
[13:12:35] <brettfrable> it works on one page
[13:12:36] <brettfrable> doesn't the next

[13:12:50] <hlveheart> brettfrable lol relax, type in sentence, not lines ;)
[13:13:03] <brettfrable> can you check it out
[13:13:07] <brettfrable> go to that link i sent you
[13:13:11] <hlveheart> Jsfiddle Plz.
[13:13:15] <brettfrable> if you go to page two - it loads on ajax
[13:13:21] <brettfrable> i can't to it with js fiddle
[13:13:25] <brettfrable> it's loading from a cms
[13:13:30] <hlveheart> Errrrrr
[13:13:36] <samuel02> hlveheart, why does that work?
[13:14:38] <hlveheart> samuel02, it must not have been geting sent to the DOM early enough
[13:14:41] <hlveheart> IE is a little sluggish
[13:15:48] <samuel02> hlveheart, I see.. Thanks! Now it's time to see how I can implement in my real code that is slightly more complex..
[13:17:09] <hlveheart> :D
[13:17:12] <hlveheart> glad I could help
[13:17:15] <hlveheart> sorry it took so long
[13:18:05] <oneseventeen> silly noob question: how do I pass data from javascript variables to server side code using .getJSON() ?
[13:18:35] <samuel02> hlveheart, thanks
[13:18:37] <oneseventeen> I know how to easily manually type in data, I'm just curious the syntax to add javascript variables
[13:18:41] <hlveheart> Yup yup.
[13:19:19] <Back2Basics> oneseventeen: you can send with the "ajax" call
[13:19:24] <hlveheart> oneseventeen: The $.getJSON() routine is for fetching JSON-encoded content from the server
[13:19:25] <hlveheart> o.o
[13:19:47] <hlveheart> Not TO the server ;P
[13:20:19] <oneseventeen> sorry, I thought the .getJSON was just a quick ajax function shorthand that allows sending data.
[13:20:25] <hlveheart> it's all good lol
[13:21:10] <Back2Basics> oneseventeen: then you can use encode and decode to un/re-json-ify
[13:22:39] <oneseventeen> so even if I use .ajax I'm still trying to sort out the best way to send keys & values.
[13:22:51] <oneseventeen> (I think I actually have more of a super-basic javascript question)
[13:23:46] <jeffreylevesque> I'm trying to add a functionality to my menu - when users click outside the menu, any menu's visible toggles out of view: http://jsfiddle.net/jmm42/w7uUa/2/?
[13:23:59] <oneseventeen> My problem is I have a javascript variable already that has the same name as the 'key' in my data map, so I'm thinking I'll wind up with a key and value that are both the value..
[13:24:03] <oneseventeen> wow, I'm terrible at describing this
[13:25:06] <zap0> how does that on-view image loading thingy work?     only loads images when <img> is visible
[13:25:18] <DERPOoooo> hey guys, what is best practice on where to hide a hidden field?
[13:25:40] * jeffsmykil refrains from making a bum joke
[13:26:11] <Andweeeee> 	oneseventeen dude go to jsfiddle.net and recreate your code

[13:30:55] <jeffreylevesque> would someone mind taking a look at my menu: http://jsfiddle.net/jmm42/w7uUa/2/
[13:31:19] <hlveheart> jeffisabelle, what are we looking at? :)
[13:31:32] <jeffreylevesque> isabelle?
[13:31:37] <hlveheart> oops
[13:31:39] <hlveheart> lol
[13:31:47] <jeffreylevesque> I'm going to pretend you know me, or not
[13:31:49] <jeffreylevesque> anyways lol
[13:31:51] <hlveheart> :P
[13:32:14] <hlveheart> that's one hell of a bulky jquery just for dropdowns...
[13:32:16] <jeffreylevesque> clickin on the menu expands the children of the menu as it should
[13:32:49] <hlveheart> right
[13:32:52] <tri> how to disable caching when using jquery and getJSON ?
[13:33:09] <jeffreylevesque> hlveheart: I added a section "This is what I want to edit:  " in the jquery
[13:33:25] <jeffreylevesque> so clicking outside the menu toggles out the expanded menu
[13:33:26] <hlveheart> tri: $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false }); ;P
[13:33:52] <hlveheart> jeffisabelle, and you don't want it to toggle the menus?
[13:34:05] <hlveheart> er damnit
[13:34:07] <hlveheart> jeffreylevesque*
[13:34:08] <hlveheart> lol
[13:34:10] <jeffreylevesque> lol
[13:34:21] <jeffreylevesque> do i know you?
[13:34:25] <hlveheart> no o_O
[13:34:34] <jeffreylevesque> haha
[13:34:36] <hlveheart> :P
[13:35:38] <jeffreylevesque> if you click "one", "two",
[13:35:38] <hlveheart> alright, jeffreylevesque, what are you looking to edit in that jQ?
[13:35:43] <hlveheart> yeah
[13:35:47] <jeffreylevesque> then click outside the menu
[13:35:55] <jeffreylevesque> it doesn't toggle out any active menu's
[13:36:02] <jeffreylevesque> it only works on the first iteration
[13:36:06] <jeffreylevesque> of click

[13:50:42] <blendedbychris> hey friends‚Ä¶ does anyone know of a full screen "centerable" carousel?
[13:51:06] <hlveheart> blendedbychris, if it's full screen, what's there to center? lol
[13:51:07] <blendedbychris> i feel like i'm going to have to reinvent the wheel here
[13:51:34] <blendedbychris> hlveheart: the carousel items would crop on both sides the same amount.
[13:51:49] <blendedbychris> almost like an offset i guess?
[13:55:47] <hlveheart> blendedbychris: http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/docs.html ?
[13:55:53] <hlveheart> :P
[13:56:04] <hlveheart> That one has a horizontal_center just for you.
[13:56:50] <blendedbychris> hlveheart: brilliant
[13:56:55] <hlveheart> :) Enjoy.
[14:06:03] <blendedbychris> hlveheart: eh hrm‚Ä¶ looks like it won't attach itself to a <div> (or whatever else)
[14:06:18] <blendedbychris> only the page body?
[14:07:09] <blendedbychris> ah the right google search is giving me some better results
[14:07:55] <blendedbychris> http://coolcarousels.jimdo.com/ << precisely what i'm after :)
[14:08:43] <MistuhKurtz> blendedbychris, I've recently worked on a project with full-sized slideshows/carousels
[14:09:29] <MistuhKurtz> At first I tried using http://caroufredsel.frebsite.nl/ -- they have a demo for a full-screen one...let me find it
[14:11:07] <MistuhKurtz> blendedbychris, http://coolcarousels.frebsite.nl/c/3/
[14:11:58] <MistuhKurtz> Ultimately I ended up just using jQuery cycle, though, with a little bit of extra JS to center & crop the photos
[14:12:21] <MistuhKurtz> attached on the $(window).resize() event
[14:13:08] <developer> hi guys  how can i put this<  div id="getlog"> into   <div class="bar"style="width:  ?????;">
[14:13:08] <developer> <developer> i got JQ to output getlog, extenal php file, on id="getlog"
[14:14:43] <MistuhKurtz> hah, actually it looks like that link you found is using the same caroufredsel plugin, blendedbychris
[14:15:27] <MistuhKurtz> developer, $("#getlog").appendTo("#container");
[14:16:31] <developer> mistuhkurtz im trying to display % into the bootstrap progress bar, from php file
[14:16:40] <developer> i dont understand what you just posted :(
[14:18:48] <MistuhKurtz> developer, I'm sorry, I'm not sure how to help, sorry.
[14:19:05] <developer> its ok im not sure if its JQ problem or css
[14:19:12] <developer> im so very well confused from this crap
[14:19:17] <developer> been on it for 2 hours
[14:21:03] <developer> what im trying to do is, use JQ to display ajax refresh external php file, through getlog,  example <div id="getlist"></div> this works but im not sure how to get this value into the progress bar from bootstrap
[14:21:13] <developer> im so confused by this
[14:46:24] <blendedbychris> MistuhKurtz: mine keepsh iding
[14:46:28] <blendedbychris> hrm
[14:46:34] <MistuhKurtz> what?
[14:47:02] <blendedbychris> oh wait i found the issue
[14:49:02] <blendedbychris> MistuhKurtz: did you have to specify a height on your container?
[14:49:29] <JFranks> Is there an easy place to put .js files so they can be loaded by jsfiddle? I could host it on a website I own, but I wanted to make a fiddle that doesn't need anything from me.. ;p
[14:58:50] <JFranks> Ooops okay I'm an idiot.. here's what I was trying to ask about: http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/37/    As you can see I've taken the original menu code and made it work as a drop-down for tables.. My problem is that in most cases I only want to define the menu choices once, which I can do with a few tweaks, but then I lose tracking on which item was changed, because the default script is referencing the menu items each time, not passing any 
[14:58:50] <JFranks> use to decide where the user has clicked, which I can work around with unique menu choices on each row of the table, but that's fugly.. ;p
[15:12:57] <r3v3rb> can someone tell me why : http://jsfiddle.net/drpk5/2/ doesn;t open the fancybox with the content in each li ?
[15:16:39] <rmurphey> r3v3rb: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fancybox'
[15:16:56] <rmurphey> you'll need to add fancybox as a resource
[15:17:13] <r3v3rb> rmurphey: yeh, sorry was just throwing the code up there
[15:17:19] <r3v3rb> let me add it
[15:19:36] <BFranks> Cleaned up my example a little bit: http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/44/  .. Trying to find a way to pass on the row (and column if possible) of the menu that was picked.. right now I'm cheating by loading a unique list for each row, but that will get old fast.. ;p
[15:50:54] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:22:06] <itsrachelfish> Is there any way to use jquery with ::selection? http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selection.html
[16:28:21] <bnm> istrachelfish:     $("::selection")
[16:30:07] <itsrachelfish> bnm: How would I use that inside of a each()?
[16:30:47] <bnm> for example?
[16:32:19] <itsrachelfish> $('.highlight').children().each(function() { $(this).css('background-color': '#00f')  });
[16:39:58] <bnm> itsrachelfish: you may try   children( "::selection" )   but I actually don't get what is the problem
[16:47:19] <kevinquinnyo> if im using .load to load another page with a form into a div .  when user submits, i want to override the browser refreshing the page, and instead refresh the loaded page in the div
[16:47:26] <kevinquinnyo> shit that was confusing
[16:47:45] <kevinquinnyo> does that make sense, or should i clarify/rephrase?
[16:48:17] <kevinquinnyo> i would be very appreciative if someone can help me solve this one
[16:48:41] <shoky> kevinquinnyo: yea that makes sense
[16:49:47] <kevinquinnyo> shoky: just so you know, i dont have access to the code directly, i'm
[16:49:50] <shoky> you'll wanna handle the submit event for the form, and call event.preventDefault()
[16:50:25] <Whirl3d__> shoky! how you been?
[16:50:25] <kevinquinnyo> ignore my fragment of a response above
[16:50:52] <shoky> whirlz, am alrighties, been working some
[16:51:01] <shoky> what's up
[16:51:27] <kevinquinnyo> shoky: i'm looking that up now, but i wanted to preface by saying i'm using firebug, because i dont have access to the code, (if it matters).  this will be bookmarklet or plugin when done
[16:51:58] <shoky> k..
[16:52:19] <Whirl3d__> Just getting over a miserable flu or something man, I thought I was gonna hack up a lung at one point. Not a good time to run low on vitamin cm. either.
[16:52:36] <imachuchu> so I have an autocomplete dialog that attaches to a group of text fields through a shared class. When I clone one of the classes (and then change the id of the field) the autocomplete no longer works
[16:53:21] <imachuchu> I also tried reattaching the autocomplete after the clone directly to the id of the new field, but to no avail
[16:53:49] <Whirl3d__> imachuchu, because there are a number of way to achieve the thing you just mentioned, some good some not so good, it's best to see your exactly implimentation.
[16:54:14] <Whirl3d__> if you paste your code (html, js, css) to jsfiddle and share the link here, it's easier for us to help
[16:54:33] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: my exact implementation is created through django and quite long, I'll get a fiddle going but it may take a while
[16:54:47] <Whirl3d__> just make a limited use case
[16:54:54] <Whirl3d__> just the part that's not working...
[16:55:12] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: I'll see what I can do, I may have to show it tomorrow
[16:55:51] <shoky> flu, yach
[16:55:54] <viki> hello.. I have been working on simulating mousemove event using jquery.. However, I wasn't able to supply the x,y coords to the mousemove event.. can someone help me out? Thanks
[16:56:11] <Whirl3d__> If you have the page that isn't working, you should be able to cut and paste the pieces. But tomorrow is fine as well. Whatever works for ya.
[16:56:21] <shoky> viki: jquery doesn't really help out with simulating mouse events, afaik
[16:56:57] <viki> ah :( .. I thought so after googling quite a bit..
[16:57:12] <viki> thanks
[16:57:40] <coldhead> can anyone please kill me?
[16:57:50] <shoky> what's in it for me
[16:57:54] <tw2113> i can zombify you coldhead
[16:58:07] <Whirl3d__> coldhead, come on, you are doing a nice job yourself, don't ya think...
[16:58:21] <coldhead> but it takes so lonnnng
[16:58:21] <Whirl3d__> I mean, seriously, give yourself some credit here.
[16:58:29] <Whirl3d__> that's half the fun of it.
[16:59:48] <Whirl3d__> What's pushed you over the edge this time? (and don'tbelieve tw2113, we had him convinced that we were all zombies rather than just ignoring him the other day...now he's on some head trip)
[17:01:10] <shoky> y'all zombies
[17:01:47] <coldhead> it's just the whole milieu, you know?
[17:01:51] <kevinquinnyo> shoky: hmm that definitely prevents the form from submitting altogether, but i am looking to have it submit, but when it does, refresh the div it was loaded in
[17:01:51] <coldhead> every particle of it
[17:02:12] <kevinquinnyo> as opposed to the whole page
[17:02:24] <Whirl3d__> Where are you located again? perhaps you aren't getting enough vitamin D
[17:02:25] <shoky> kevinquinnyo: that means you are not looking to have it submit, as that would load a new page altogether
[17:02:54] <shoky> kevinquinnyo: you want to post an ajax request
[17:03:20] <shoky> actually if this is all for a bookmarklet, i have no idea what you want to do
[17:03:35] <kevinquinnyo> shoky: hmm i was wondering. do i need to manually construct, then the post parameters i want to send
[17:03:53] <shoky> no, you could serialize the form with .seriazlie()
[17:03:57] <shoky> .serialize()
[17:04:02] <shoky> and send that as the request data
[17:04:02] <kevinquinnyo> checking that one ^
[17:04:49] <tw2113> braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaains
[17:05:03] <tw2113> Whirl3d__ there's reason i show up here and not #css
[17:05:08] <tw2113> and it's braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaains
[17:05:43] * Whirl3d__ wipes his forehead knowing he's not in danger...
[17:06:23] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: if you have a second take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/F49nG/
[17:06:33] <imachuchu> and go ahead and tell me what more you would like to see
[17:08:39] <Whirl3d__> imachuchu, where do you have any actions defined ?
[17:08:49] <kevinquinnyo> shoky: thanks!  not solved yet, but serialize() might do it.  also very useful, it urlencodes, that's handy
[17:08:55] <Whirl3d__> Like click or change handlers.... the ones that are failing ya
[17:09:10] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: thought I copied them over, give me a sec
[17:09:47] <Whirl3d__> First let me ask you this. Are you assigning the change or click actions to the individual elements that are changing or clicking?
[17:10:55] <Whirl3d__> Because you need to be delegating those handlers to the parent element (in this case the form)....Because the form it'self is never replaced, handlers attached to it will always work. Even if you expand or change the inside
[17:12:09] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: I guess individual elements (through their class), http://jsfiddle.net/F49nG/1/ (the nodcSubmit function)
[17:13:59] <imachuchu> also is there a way of getting line numbers in jsfiddle?
[17:14:12] <Whirl3d__> not yet unfortunately
[17:14:42] <imachuchu> darn
[17:17:08] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: is there an example of attaching autocomplete/things to parent forms but only to some of the children elements?
[17:17:17] <kevinquinnyo> shoky: et al, if i use event.preventDefault, i then want to send the post request contructed with .serialize() on .click action . is there a way to replaceDefault()
[17:17:40] <Whirl3d__> imachuchu, I'm sorry to say this, but that's entirely too much to look at. It would take me quite a while just to get to the point where I understood what you are trying to accomplish and then it would take a while before I could figure out how to fix it.
[17:18:05] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: yeah, why I'm leery to post the code around
[17:18:28] <Whirl3d__> What I can tell you is this: usually what happens in a situation like you describe is that new elements are added, but the event handlers needed for those elements are bound because they are new
[17:19:12] <Whirl3d__> This can be avoided by binding the event handlers to a common-non-replacable element....then, you can add 50 or take away 50 elements and the handlers will still work.
[17:19:21] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: so, given what you said earlier, the best thing instead is to bind the autocomplete to the form rather then the individual fields
[17:19:32] <kevinquinnyo> ohhhh nm, i got this :)
[17:20:07] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: the problem (at least as I see) is that since this is an autocomplete it needs to be bound to the individual elements (so that the pop-down box pops down beneith that field)
[17:20:09] <Whirl3d__> Wait. Now that you mention autocomplete, you are one step outside of my skillset. I haven't messed around enough with autocomplete to know for sure.
[17:20:27] <Whirl3d__> I think you have to reinit the autocomplete if you add elements
[17:20:28] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: darn, it's really nice but just isn't binding well
[17:20:58] <imachuchu> hmmm, actually... what would be the best way to remove such a thing?
[17:21:38] <Whirl3d__> I'm not really sure.
[17:22:08] <Whirl3d__> I'll look for a minute and see if anything sticks out, but no guarantees.
[17:22:13] <imachuchu> kk
[17:22:35] <imachuchu> basically I'm not sure how to, given an object, remove all events attached to it
[17:25:02] <crankharder> are there any other recommended graph/charting libraries besides highcharts and jqplot?
[17:26:13] <LessSeen> d3
[17:26:26] <Whirl3d__> imachuchu, if you look up the api for autocomplete, under the methods tab, you'll see the "destroy" method. That will remove the bindings http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple-remote
[17:26:45] <LessSeen> crankharder: d3
[17:27:43] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: hmm that might just work, give me a second to test
[17:29:02] <Whirl3d__> You would think that autocomplete would have a more elegant way of refreshing it's source...something like an autoComplete.refresh() that would destroy and rebind in the background
[17:30:52] <imachuchu> Whirl3d__: still no luck, but let me mess around a bit more to make sure and to test it'
[17:31:05] <imachuchu> *to test autocomplete's other options

[17:49:07] <crankharder> LessSeen: does d3 use jquery?
[17:49:21] <crankharder> doesn't seem like it's defined on any of the example pages
[17:57:30] <LindsayMac> tw2113: is a sick puppy ;)
[18:07:16] <daum> hey guys i'm trying to figure out how to select the following: http://pastie.org/4309540 given the selector #tit1, how can i get all elemetns that are in its parents div which have class 'title'
[18:11:09] <rmurphey> daum: see .parents(), .closest() and .find()
[18:20:25] <notjrbauer> is it possible to use jquery to find inline scripts on a page?
[18:20:43] <MistuhKurtz> notjrbauer, what are you trying to do?
[18:21:06] <notjrbauer> im doing a mobile site
[18:21:07] <MistuhKurtz> usually testing for a var created by an inline script would be better imho
[18:21:16] <MistuhKurtz> Specifically, I mean
[18:21:17] <notjrbauer> and wanna scrape their analytics
[18:21:35] <notjrbauer> like google analytic's variables
[18:22:49] <mrcriffis> .closest(selector) starts with the current element, and traverses upwards in the DOM until it finds a selector match.
[18:22:50] <mrcriffis> .parents(selector) adds every parent element beginning with the current element's immediate parent all the way up to the document root, then filters down to the elements that match the selector.
[18:22:50] <mrcriffis> The result is that closest() always returns one or zero elements while parents() returns zero or more.
[18:24:34] <MistuhKurtz> so notjrbauer, I would test typeof _gaq
[18:24:59] <MistuhKurtz> that's the array for the analytics account settings
[18:47:27] <duc_> http://www.mathias-bank.de/jQuery/jquery.fit2Box.js
[18:47:33] <duc_> im trying to use that with jquery-ui's resizable
[18:47:47] <duc_> but once i hit the fit2box, the resizable wont respond anymore
[18:47:48] <duc_> any ideas why?
[19:09:01] <xckpd7_> question (I know this is laughable but..) I want to make a javascript vim clone (just some of the features for now) and I'm wondering how to go about it
[19:09:43] <xckpd7_> I know that it's possible to move the cursor in javascript, but I need a way to move the cursor as like a block, but disable (and get it to look like the cursor again) until it's ready
[19:14:24] <MistuhKurtz> xckpd7_, sounds like you have quite the project ahead of you ;)
[19:14:25] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[19:15:13] <xckpd7_> well I need a pet project.. tired of my job and even if I fail, it'll probably give me experience to go do other things
[19:15:26] <xckpd7_> though these guys did what I"m trying to do: http://ace.ajax.org/build/kitchen-sink.html
[19:15:53] <xckpd7_> I didn't think I would even find it. But working vim bindings, inside a pretty full fledged code editor no less
[19:22:14] <LindsayMac> So I have a smooth scrolling script which has been working pretty well for me.. Until i wanted tabs on a page.. and now i am getting a smooth scroll on tabs so the browser jumps when going to a tab.
[19:22:45] <LindsayMac> So my question is.. is there a way to make a <ahref="#id"> not register with the smooth scroll
[19:23:14] <LindsayMac> here's the script http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/anFRB/1/
[19:27:18] <coldhead> LindsayMac: http://jsfiddle.net/anFRB/2/
[19:27:43] <coldhead> i've just added class="noscroll" to one of the As and excluded As with that class from the scroll binding
[19:27:45] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  what did you change?
[19:28:02] <LindsayMac> ah
[19:28:06] <coldhead> :not('.noscroll') is the key bit
[19:28:11] <AnonymousPrime> was gonna say, :not is yr friend
[19:28:11] <LindsayMac> d'oh!
[19:28:13] <coldhead> er, sans quotes
[19:28:17] <AnonymousPrime> +1 to coldhead ::)
[19:29:14] <LindsayMac> since i have you guys here.. any thoughts on how to switch that little snippet to allow for "deep linking"... i twas working but i think i did something to break that bit.. nt sure. Still learning this javascript stuf f
[19:29:31] <Tronic> ajax() is sending my request data (JSON) as Latin-1 instead of UTF-8. Why is that?
[19:29:52] <Tronic> Is the charset conversion only done for urlencoding?
[19:31:48] <LindsayMac> Gah ok.. so it makes sense... but strangely NOT triggering the noscroll call on my site..
[19:32:29] <coldhead> i don't know what you mean by deep linking, LindsayMac
[19:32:29] <LindsayMac> NEVERMIND
[19:32:35] <LindsayMac> CONTINUING TO BE AN IDIOT HERE
[19:32:39] <duc_> is there any way to know where exactly the browser breaks a line in a text? like a <span> that is too long for its parent and is broken into two lines?
[19:32:44] <duc_> i need to know where in the line is the break
[19:32:47] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  deep linking meaning simply allow to link directly to a div container
[19:32:51] <coldhead> Tronic: i would expect your json to be properly encoded, it shouldn't just be for URLs
[19:33:43] <coldhead> duc_: it's gross but you generally have to clone the element off screen, and keep reducing the width until the height increases
[19:33:54] <coldhead> and that will be the sweet spot
[19:34:06] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  thanks for the previous suggestion.. works perfectly. As for deep linking.. I want to be able to link to < ahref="mydomain.com/#panel1"> from outside areas
[19:34:55] <duc_> coldhead is that going to work with more than 2 lines?
[19:34:59] <duc_> like, X lines?
[19:35:11] <coldhead> duc_: not elegantly, but in theory
[19:35:37] <coldhead> LindsayMac: if you want something like that to work you need to examine window.location.hash when the page loads
[19:35:43] <coldhead> and do your scrolling there
[19:35:55] <coldhead> or not do your scrolling there, as appropriate
[19:35:56] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  ok thanks for the direction. I'm going to look in to that now
[19:36:09] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  what do you mean by "not do your scrolling there"
[19:37:40] <coldhead> if you don't want to scroll to certain elements
[19:37:47] <coldhead> you can avoid doing that
[19:37:49] <coldhead> if necessary
[19:38:05] <LindsayMac> Oh i understand..
[19:38:31] <coldhead> we're all on the same page then
[19:38:34] <coldhead> good work everyone
[19:38:35] <coldhead> take 5
[19:38:44] <LindsayMac> haha thanks coldhead
[19:41:38] <Tronic> Nevermind, apparently JQuery did things right and Latin-1 only appeared at some point on the server side. nc -l 80 is your friend when debugging AJAX requests :)
[19:43:02] <coldhead> good debugging, Tronic++
[19:43:13] <coldhead> if only more people took matters in hand like that
[19:52:15] <LindsayMac> soclose.. yet sofar
[19:53:00] <hariom> From my home page, on button click, I want to fire a form get request (not the ajax get). I have created form element dynamically as $('<form ... </form>').submit() but it doesn't seem to work.
[19:53:29] <hariom> Note that the new location is subdomain.domain.com where as the button click is at domain.com .
[20:00:02] <LindsayMac> If anyone's around.. can someone take a look at this and tell me why the window.location.hash=this.has line is NOT giving me the proper hash in the url when trying to link directly to a div ? http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/anFRB/3/
[20:00:11] <LindsayMac> be nice.. i am pretty new to this
[20:04:19] <LindsayMac> Meh.. i have to leave :( i will have to tackle it tomorrow...
[20:04:29] <LindsayMac> thanks for the help and pointing in the right direction. SO CLOSE
[20:08:20] <Lihan> Will anyone look at this ticket please? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12123 Test page is http://jsfiddle.net/MMJSP/1/
[20:19:42] <FGL> is it okay to drop beginner issues here or is there a special channel or archive for that? Support on the website itself didn't bear much fruit
[20:20:28] <tw2113> just ask FGL
[20:21:58] <FGL> alright, I am working with the accordeon navigation, got it to run quite nicely, now I wanted to know if you can somehow implement that when opening one of the menu bars, you are also transferred to another subpage in the process
[20:22:10] <FGL> or basically just link the sections.
[20:45:05] <Smarter_Child> how hard is it to employ AI on a site?
[20:45:48] <coldhead> probably 2 - 3 hours, Smarter_Child
[20:46:39] <Smarter_Child> ever think about how difficult it'd be?
[20:49:10] <coldhead> i'm thinking about it right now
[20:49:24] <coldhead> also toasted coconut
[20:51:15] <vladikoff> use ai.js
[20:51:45] <dschuett> does anyone have any recommendations for a replacement for ajaxfileupload? I need a way to upload a file along with other form data on form submit.
[20:52:56] <coldhead> this is very popular, dschuett https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[21:06:16] <coldhead> b-ot: tell dschuett YOU ARE SO WELCOME
[21:06:16] <b-ot> coldhead, I‚Äôll tell dschuett about that.
[21:06:24] <coldhead> you can also tell him he's a massive jerk
[21:12:23] <xboi209> hey guys, i'm using .css() to change the background image but I want to have 2 background images, how can i do that?
[21:14:01] <xboi209> .
[21:14:10] <xboi209> anyone?
[21:15:20] <xboi209> this place is quiet :O
[21:17:43] <tw2113> *burps*
[21:23:48] <xboi209> so no ones here to help me i guess D:
[21:24:19] <tw2113> dunno how you'd do multi-bg with .css()
[21:24:35] <xboi209> its available in css3
[21:24:45] <xboi209> but my problem is how do i set other properties for it
[21:24:53] <xboi209> like my first image will be on the left and second on the right
[21:25:00] <tw2113> i realize it's available in css3, this is jQuery though
[21:25:06] <xboi209> i know
[21:25:12] <xboi209> i use .css() and it'll be the same thing
[21:25:38] <tw2113> someone can back me up or deny me, but i wonder if you can pass in arrays
[22:07:36] <wiickeed> how would you call a plugin that shows websites keywords
[22:08:13] <wiickeed> about a year ago i found a jquery plugin that showed a bunch of text in this 3d ball shape
[22:08:31] <wiickeed> anyway basically i am looking for some plugin that shows keywords
[22:08:49] <coldhead> this kind of thing? http://www.htmldrive.net/items/show/412/jquery-rotating-3d-tag-cloud
[22:09:03] <wiickeed> yes yes
[22:09:09] <wiickeed> thanks coldhead
[22:16:21] <coldhead> can anyone tell me why this doesn't work? it's supposed to be a simple shopping cart but it doesn't work right in chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/HdJ6t/3/show/
[22:17:57] <klocatelli> that's a bizarre shopping cart
[22:18:27] <coldhead> i am having trouble with this contractor
[22:20:18] <klocatelli> you contracted someone to build that? lol
[22:21:19] <klocatelli> he's not very fun on twitter :(
[22:21:35] <klocatelli> or at least, the bizarre spinning head guy isn't
[22:22:11] <coldhead> he said the spinning head is "test data"
[22:22:24] <klocatelli> rofl
[22:22:25] <klocatelli> well
[22:22:40] <klocatelli> that will be a very interesting shopping cart if *that's* "test data"
[22:24:16] <klocatelli> to put it very nicely
[22:24:27] <coldhead> he said it works fine in firefox and he's fixing it in chrome
[22:24:32] <coldhead> but i don't have firefox to test
[22:24:40] <klocatelli> well, it works fine in chrome
[22:24:40] <klocatelli> so
[22:24:42] <coldhead> i will download it
[22:24:59] <klocatelli> maybe he got it opposite
[22:25:02] <coldhead> it doesn't work fine! the man's head spins and there is no shopping cart icon
[22:25:45] <klocatelli> well
[22:25:52] <klocatelli> in firefox I see the man's head (sans spinning)
[22:25:57] <klocatelli> in chrome I see head + spinning
[22:26:32] <klocatelli> and no where (not even in the source) do I see a shopping cart
[22:26:38] <klocatelli> so
[22:26:48] <klocatelli> that guy needs English lessons
[22:26:54] <klocatelli> :)
[22:27:12] <coldhead> okay, thanks klocatelli
[22:27:16] <coldhead> i will get him on skype
[22:27:21] <coldhead> and tell him what you said
[22:27:24] <klocatelli> alright, no problem :)
[22:47:28] <azbyin> hi all.. does .click() not trigger a click and also change state of a checkbox in jquery 1.5 ?
[22:50:47] <coldhead> it just fires the click handler, azbyin
[22:50:53] <coldhead> you have to change the state yourself
[22:51:07] <azbyin> coldhead, jquery 1.7.2 does both
[22:51:26] <azbyin> also with 1.5.1 i cannot get it to even trigger the handler
[22:52:33] <azbyin> from the firebug console, i can see that i am definitely selecting the correct checkbox, but neither the handler runs, nor the state changes.
[22:56:50] <diverdude> Is it possible to extract image dimensions in jquery?
[22:57:15] <coldhead> diverdude: $('img').width(), .height();
[22:57:37] <coldhead> azbyin: i must be wrong about the state change them, it should be the same between version
[22:57:37] <coldhead> s
[22:57:43] <azbyin> $("input[type=radio]:eq(0)").click();
[22:57:55] <coldhead> type="radio"
[22:58:02] <coldhead> you need to quote it
[22:58:13] <diverdude> coldhead: isn't that the width and height of the html element? i need to real width and height
[22:58:17] <azbyin> oh, ok. i remember reading somehwere that you don;t need to quote it
[22:58:34] <azbyin> it works fine in 1.7.2 and fails in 1.5.1, will try with quoting now
[22:59:07] <azbyin> but i know for sure it is selecting the right element even without quoting as seen on firebug console
[22:59:26] <azbyin> coldhead, nope, doesn;t work
[22:59:47] <azbyin> is there a reason jsfiddle has 1.5.2 in the list of jquery versions and not 1.5.1 ?
[23:00:11] <azbyin> is it simply because 1.5.2 is the last stable in 1.5 series or because 1.5.2 was a bugfix release to 1.5.1 ?
[23:00:13] <coldhead> diverdude: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42323/real-image-width-with-javascript
[23:00:16] <coldhead> .clientwidth
[23:00:25] <coldhead> i vaguely remember that doesn't work everywhere though
[23:00:39] <coldhead> azbyin: can you link us to a demo of it failing?
[23:03:18] <azbyin> $("input[type='radio']:eq(1)")   shows the correct item in the console
[23:13:53] <azbyin> coldhead, http://jsfiddle.net/RR5Tt/1/
[23:14:15] <azbyin> 1.7.2 and click triggers action *and* also changes state
[23:15:09] <coldhead> so it seems
[23:15:09] <coldhead> and it does that in 1.5.2
[23:15:43] <azbyin> so 1.5.1 is buggy then
[23:15:54] <azbyin> or just that we haven;t read the changelog
[23:16:11] <azbyin> it is not mentioned anywhere in the api docs about this behaviour
[23:16:14] <coldhead> it may well be buggy
[23:16:39] <coldhead> you're generally recommended to use the last release of a minor version
[23:16:46] <azbyin> also $("input[type='radio']:eq(1)").click().attr("checked", "checked"); does not work on my page. it changes the state, but does not trigger the click event
[23:16:50] <coldhead> 1.minor.highst_number_possible
[23:17:53] <azbyin> you can try to manually change the radio to 'Medium' and notice the map change. which doesn;t occur with that above js statement
[23:18:06] <coldhead> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/03/31/jquery-152-released/
[23:18:20] <coldhead> any of those tickets could be the problem
[23:23:04] <diverdude> coldhead: the real dimension is 512x512. How do i extract those values? http://jsfiddle.net/kJwJU/7/
[23:29:31] <gavilan2> I have a web site with no paging, and I want to implement paging on the server side. I'm looking for things that can help both "draw" the 1,2,3,next etc... things, and to send the proper requests to the server (add the from=x&to=y). Any idea what tools, plugins or anything that might help me? I'm currently working with JQuery + underscore + boostrap + some backbone...
[23:34:39] <klocatelli> I'm sure there is, but you could easily do that yourself in a couple lines...
[23:37:32] <coldhead> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/kJwJU/12/
[23:37:39] <coldhead> that seems to work
[23:39:05] <atodorovic> hi everyone
[23:39:26] <coldhead> hi atodorovic
[23:39:30] <coldhead> great to have you here
[23:40:23] <atodorovic> thanks coldhead, I was wondering if you guys would be able to give me a nudge in the right direction, as I'm kind of stuck and very new to jquery at this point
[23:40:59] <gavilan2> klocatelli: 1 line is better than 10 lines...
[23:41:33] <atodorovic> I have the following bit of jquery code, that for the life of me I cannot get to execute by the looks of things --> http://jsfiddle.net/aKHLY/136/
[23:41:35] <coldhead> 10 lines may be more readable, gavilan2
[23:42:19] <atodorovic> it's on a page that dynamically loads a table full of data from mysql via an ajax call, and a <div id="txtHint"> that's updated with the results
[23:43:40] <atodorovic> the results look like the jsfiddle demo, same class names, same id(s)
[23:44:14] <coldhead> and what's not working?
[23:44:20] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/aKHLY/137/
[23:44:32] <coldhead> i added encodeURI() there to escape the " "s
[23:44:41] <atodorovic> i dont see anything in the actual console from chrome when i select a checkbox, so I assume that it's not being executed
[23:45:27] <coldhead> i see things!
[23:45:33] <coldhead> try alert() instead of console.log()
[23:45:45] <coldhead> just for the obviousness
[23:45:59] <atodorovic> trying
[23:46:15] <atodorovic> nothing :(
[23:46:35] <coldhead> it doesn't work for you in the fiddle?
[23:46:53] <atodorovic> in jsfiddle it works as intended
[23:47:11] <coldhead> right!
[23:47:13] <atodorovic> when i add it to the actual page, nothing happens
[23:47:27] <coldhead> and the content on the page is loaded via ajax?
[23:47:51] <atodorovic> yes, the part that I need this to run on once it's been updated
[23:48:00] <coldhead> does it work if you change the selector from $('table.whatever').delegate(...) to $(document).delegate(...)
[23:48:27] <atodorovic> nope I've tried that, thinking that I'm trying to execute on the wrong class / id
[23:48:33] <atodorovic> I'm using this as the ajax call --> http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_php.asp
[23:49:05] <coldhead> you're not... using jQuery for the ajax?
[23:49:06] <atodorovic> sorry this one --> http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_database.asp
[23:50:17] <ryanaz> atodorovic: what's the question?
[23:50:29] <ryanaz> !seen systemfault
[23:50:29] <b-ot> ryanaz, I saw systemfault 14h 43m ago, here in #jquery, saying: maltray: Not really
[23:51:13] <atodorovic> ryanaz: I'm trying to run a bit of jquery to update links depending on the checkboxes checked via a table that's returned to the page via ajax, but it's not being called from what I can see
[23:51:16] <ryanaz> what's the difference between jquery and query mobile?
[23:51:56] <ryanaz> atodorivic: got some code?
[23:52:05] <atodorovic> http://jsfiddle.net/aKHLY/138/
[23:52:15] <coldhead> mobile is a framework that uses jquery and css and html to work well on mobile site
[23:52:16] <coldhead> s
[23:52:22] <coldhead> jquery is just jquery
[23:53:58] <ryanaz> coldhead: gotcha
[23:54:23] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  What you trying to do ?
[23:54:33] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  your logic doesn't make sense to me
[23:55:20] <atodorovic> ryanaz: trying to get the checked checkboxes, and update a bunch of links on the page with their IDs
[23:56:03] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  um, can you explain in the sense of ‚Ä¶. "do this, then do that, or do this, when that happens."
[23:56:14] <atodorovic> sure
[23:56:19] <coldhead> the logic isn't at issue, the question is why doesn't the event trigger
[23:56:35] <coldhead> and my guess is you're trying to delegate to an element that isn't present yet
[23:56:36] <anu> Hi al, i am developing a jquery mobile application. I am adding webpage to an iframe in one of the virtual pages in the mobile application by script. But there occurs an error " Domains, protocols and ports must match.". Is it because loading webpage in different virtual page? help me plz
[23:56:38] <ryanaz> coldhead: yah, but the logic seams flawed ..
[23:57:06] <atodorovic> select project --> ajax calls getCircuits.php --> result updates <div> with data in a table --> have jquery parse checkboxes & update links
[23:57:09] <coldhead> the logic of developing anything at all is flawed, people only use facebook >: |
[23:57:23] <ryanaz> coldhead: seems like an order of operations thing‚Ä¶  I've ran into this several times thinking that javascript runs like normal code (in order) but everything runs out of order, so it's hard to time the execution in order sometimes.
[23:57:26] <azbyin> ryanaz, regardless of logic, in his case what he wants to do doesn;t work and seems to work in a fiddle
[23:57:42] <azbyin> so just don;t jump in and say his logic is flawed and keep asking him what he wants to do!
[23:57:45] <atodorovic> problem is that it works on jsfiddle properly with the sample table, when i put it into the real page, i cant see it being called
[23:57:54] <coldhead> atodorovic: you can't delegate to the <table> element if that's not present when the page loads
[23:58:11] <coldhead> so if the <table> itself is loaded/created via ajax
[23:58:14] <coldhead> it don't work :(
[23:58:20] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  cold head is right‚Ä¶..  you have to assign your actions only after the element exists
[23:58:28] <coldhead> that's why i was suggesting delegating to the document
[23:58:30] <coldhead> just to test
[23:59:20] <ryanaz> coldhead:  why even delegate?    why not just name the table something like:   id=action_table  and do like $([id^=action_]) ‚Ä¶.
[23:59:28] <atodorovic> just tried it again, and nothing via alert or console.log with $('document'....
[23:59:39] <azbyin> well, you could animate some random property if you want a dummy wait and then do your parsing and updating
[23:59:50] <superchu> atodorovic: did you forget $(documeny).ready...?
