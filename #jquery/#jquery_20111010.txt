[00:01:24] <FiSHNUGGET> How can I trigger a file input click?
[00:02:00] <FiSHNUGGET> i.e. $('#nameofinput').click() doesn't work
[00:02:18] <hexa_> text input?
[00:02:22] <hexa_> .focus() surely
[00:02:25] <Chani> aww crud. I'm accidentally making all td's have a border when I only want to apply that to the td's within tables of class "node"...
[00:03:03] <FiSHNUGGET> create read update delete?
[00:03:09] <Chani> but I don't want to give every darn td a class. or write code to do this. there's gotta be something in css...
[00:03:37] <atdiehm_home> Hey guys ... I'm looking to click a thumbnail, and have the screen gray out and play a youtube video ... I've found a bunch of plugins, but they all seem old... is there an easy way to do this?
[00:03:40] <hexa_> check border-collapse hasnt been set on the table
[00:03:49] <hexa_> you cant do it for individuals cells
[00:03:56] <FiSHNUGGET> basically I want for a user to click a thumbnail and get a file select dialog box
[00:04:17] <hexa_> ah there's a bug in that for chrome where you cant open the dialog if the input isnt visible
[00:04:28] <hexa_> there was some other way i did it
[00:04:45] <FiSHNUGGET> I can just put it in a container w/ visibility:hidden
[00:04:51] <FiSHNUGGET> sicne that still holds a place in the dom
[00:05:51] <FiSHNUGGET> but I can't make it fire even when it's totally visible
[00:06:56] <hexa_> FiSHNUGGET which browser?
[00:07:06] <hexa_> .click() worked on the file inputs for me except chrome
[00:07:20] <hexa_> in the end i set it to position absolute, left -999999999px or something
[00:08:01] <FiSHNUGGET> chrome
[00:08:06] <FiSHNUGGET> ha
[00:08:07] <hexa_> yeah do that :p
[00:08:09] <FiSHNUGGET> stupid chrome
[00:08:15] <FiSHNUGGET> it's visible
[00:08:21] <FiSHNUGGET> I haven't tried top hide it yet
[00:09:22] <aibo> hi, i am using ajax getJSON method and want to ask, if I want not to `append` but substitute some data in my div, how can it be reached?
[00:09:51] <Zxurian> aibo: $(#somediv").html("new stuff");
[00:10:01] <FiSHNUGGET> ditto
[00:10:02] <aibo> Zxurian, thx
[00:11:54] <Zxurian> and FishNUGGET, you can invoike the file upload through jquery, i've done it
[00:11:55] <atdiehm_home> Anyone got tips on having YT embeds pop up in an overlay?
[00:12:13] <atdiehm_home> ( YT == YouTube, sorry! )
[00:12:15] <Zxurian> looking up my code now
[00:12:21] <hexa_> http://jsfiddle.net/hYcBg/6/
[00:12:27] <hexa_> i did summat like that
[00:14:14] <Zxurian> Fish: actually, the method I used was just $("#foo").click();
[00:14:25] <hexa_> yeah same
[00:14:29] <Zxurian> where #foo is the id of the <input id="foo" type="file"> element
[00:14:32] <Zxurian> works on chrome for me
[00:14:56] <hdtdi> atdiehm_home, http://fancybox.net/blog search a little down the page for Show youtube clips. Try now
[00:15:30] <blackspotwiggins> Zxurian, i think that does not work in firefox
[00:15:36] <Zxurian> works in firefox as well
[00:15:58] <blackspotwiggins> some browsers have pretty tight security around file inputs
[00:16:35] <Zxurian> in fact, i have it working in chrome/firefox/exploder
[00:16:54] <atdiehm_home> hdtdi, thanks! this plugin looks good... I must have looked at 10 others that didn't do what I wanted
[00:17:05] <hexa_> ah i remember why i had to do a DOM replace
[00:17:10] <hexa_> they wanted some stupid styled "add file" button
[00:44:56] <red> I'm trying to use livejs.js to monitor changes in a CSS file to force a refresh of the stylesheets of a web page -- but I'm seeing in network panel that it's getting a 304 not modified response even if the file has been modified
[00:45:04] <red> Anyone else ever tried the script and got it to work?
[00:52:13] <Zxurian> still around ndss?
[01:06:43] <nVee> hey guys. Is there a function like click() for when a user "checks" or "unchecks" a checkbox?
[01:07:14] <Zxurian> you can use the .click() event on the checkbox
[01:07:24] <Zxurian> then check for the value within the .click() function
[01:07:26] <nVee> ah, and then validate
[01:07:30] <Zxurian> yup
[01:08:06] <nVee> is there a better what that $("input[name='inputname']:checked") to check if the value is checked or not?
[01:08:15] <nVee> purely out of curiousity :)
[01:08:35] <NodeX> $().is(":checked") is boolean
[01:08:39] <Zxurian> yeaup
[01:09:06] <Zxurian> if ($(this).is(":checked")) { do_this(); } else { do_that(); }
[01:09:13] <nVee> NodeX: So I could within the click function check if($(this).is(":checked") == true) ?
[01:09:16] <nVee> ah
[01:09:20] <nVee> awesome!
[01:09:31] <drublic> nVee, right!
[01:10:09] <nVee> pretty soon you guys will ask me for advise :P
[01:10:10] <nVee> hahaha
[01:11:29] <Spadeski> nVee Yeah I hope too see it
[01:11:33] <SlexAxton> you might also bind to the change event
[01:11:36] <SlexAxton> instead of the click event
[01:11:39] <Spadeski> Means were doing well
[01:11:41] <SlexAxton> in case someone uses a keyboard
[01:11:56] <SlexAxton> yay accessibility
[01:12:06] <SlexAxton> cc nVee Zxurian
[01:12:19] <nVee> SlexAxton: mind to explain? Sorry :)
[01:12:27] <nVee> by way of example
[01:12:36] <nVee> bind sounds cool, I want to use it as well :P
[01:12:42] <ravenzz> checkboxes = change status on click
[01:12:45] <ravenzz> so bind change()
[01:12:54] <Zxurian> change will fire whenever the value is changed, click will fire whenever it registers a mouse click regardless if the value was changed or not
[01:12:56] <drublic> nVee, use $(selector).change(function(){ do_stuff });
[01:13:17] <drublic> instead of 'click' use 'change'
[01:13:27] <NodeX> bad idea
[01:13:27] <nVee> I see
[01:13:29] <Zxurian> I don't think there's a difference with checkboxes, since a click will automatically be a change, but for things like select & text, there is a difference
[01:13:33] <NodeX> use click on radio's / checks
[01:13:42] <SlexAxton> why is it a bad idea?
[01:13:44] <NodeX> change on select's
[01:13:45] <Spadeski> Does that work on images like if I changed the source of one ?
[01:13:50] <SlexAxton> because you hate people who fill out forms with their keyboard?
[01:14:06] <drublic> I'm with SlexAxton on this
[01:14:13] <ravenzz> me too
[01:14:22] <SlexAxton> (so is the rest of the internet)
[01:14:26] <drublic> :D
[01:14:28] <NodeX> that's nioce
[01:14:29] <NodeX> nice *
[01:14:34] <Zxurian> Spadeski: no
[01:14:43] <Spadeski> Damn
[01:14:50] <ravenzz> I even use keyboard to fill forms
[01:14:57] <Zxurian> ooh, good point Slex
[01:14:59] <NodeX> go make a form with 2 radios and apply a change to them and see what happends :)
[01:15:06] <NodeX> happens*
[01:15:06] <nVee> Change() sounds like a feasible solution, but is it not the same result? I mean by defauly my checkbox could be unchecked, so change could work if I really only want the user to be able to tick it once? But what happens if they tick it again (unchecks)
[01:15:10] <Zxurian> hadn't even thought about keyboard filling, and I constantly use keyboard to fill out forms
[01:15:50] <SlexAxton> NodeX: go bind a click event to a radio button and let me fill it out with my keyboard and let me know what happens
[01:15:52] <nVee> would I not have 2 change functions
[01:16:23] <NodeX> neither work properly for either... but 90% of the internet use a mouse to form fill
[01:16:34] <NodeX> so I go with the 90% not the 10% die hards
[01:16:38] <SlexAxton> NodeX: oh, cool, glad you have that stat
[01:16:52] <SlexAxton> probably don't need a reference
[01:17:01] <SlexAxton> use change nVee - it works
[01:17:39] <SlexAxton> don't try to delegate it though
[01:18:10] <SlexAxton> or if you do, don't do anything crazy
[01:18:36] <howtos> Could someone help me find the google maps data in a mashup inside a frame?
[01:18:38] <red> In D7, how do I create a query that shows me attached files based on nid?
[01:18:56] <red> trying to look thru tables to find the connecting id's but not seeing it
[01:18:59] <SlexAxton> nVee: if you're worried
[01:19:03] <SlexAxton> ?change
[01:19:03] <bot-t> .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[01:19:08] <SlexAxton> see the line that says
[01:19:09] <howtos> also, I don't think this is jquery related, but how do I save google maps to KML, just add &output=kml to the end of the URL
[01:19:09] <SlexAxton> For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus.
[01:19:32] <nVee> SlexAxton: I will use it, however, does change revert to default when it is "unchanged"?
[01:19:52] <nVee> in most checkbox cases one of 2 things need to happen
[01:19:54] <SlexAxton> it only fires when something changes
[01:20:13] <nVee> let me test it quickly
[01:22:20] <Zxurian> interesting..... using keyboard on form elements still fires the click() event
[01:22:20] <red> (I know the fid of the file and nid of the node)
[01:22:20] <ravenzz> nVee http://jsfiddle.net/Y8QmK/
[01:22:20] <SlexAxton> he didn't even ask about radio buttons to be honest
[01:22:20] <ravenzz> ^
[01:22:20] <SlexAxton> NodeX just started talking about them incorrectly to scare him, i guess
[01:22:20] <SlexAxton> go for the fake 90% bro, all the cool kids are doing it
[01:22:20] <NodeX> Not incorrectly
[01:22:20] <SlexAxton> lol
[01:22:20] <SlexAxton> then _do not_ click on that link above
[01:22:20] <SlexAxton> it will destroy your world
[01:22:27] <SlexAxton> Zxurian: only in some browsers
[01:23:06] <Zxurian> slex: i've tried exploder, chrome, & firefox so far, and they all regsiter
[01:23:08] <Zxurian> [register]
[01:23:14] <NodeX> boooom
[01:23:28] <SlexAxton> i have no idea why nodex is celebrating
[01:23:32] <SlexAxton> he keeps getting proved wrong
[01:23:37] <NodeX> must be talking incorrectly about things day :)
[01:23:54] <NodeX> how have I been proved wrong ... you must think I care what you say lol
[01:23:57] <SlexAxton> look, the change event is the safe, canonical event for form changes
[01:24:07] <NodeX> ooooo here comethe big words
[01:24:09] <SlexAxton> click is a silly decision
[01:24:35] <Zxurian> well i wouldn't say it's silly
[01:24:50] <SlexAxton> i really would
[01:24:51] <NodeX> here ciomes the +b for me
[01:25:03] <SlexAxton> only if you keep making stuff up to tell to people
[01:25:05] <Zxurian> use you change if you only want to detect on value changes, you use click if you want to detect any action regardless if it changes teh value or not
[01:25:06] <ravenzz> +banana
[01:25:32] <SlexAxton> "neither work properly for either... but 90% of the internet use a mouse to form fill"
[01:25:49] <NodeX> are you still on about this ?
[01:25:57] <Zxurian> I just said that click fires for all my elements, regardless if I'm using keyboard or mouse for filling
[01:26:02] <NodeX> you write code your way, I'll write it mine :)
[01:26:03] <SlexAxton> "go make a form with 2 radios and apply a change to them and see what happends "
[01:26:04] <Zxurian> so .click() does worth
[01:26:07] <Zxurian> [work]
[01:26:14] <NodeX> both work lol
[01:26:25] <SlexAxton> you just implied
[01:26:30] <SlexAxton> less than 5 minutes ago
[01:26:33] <SlexAxton> that change would not work
[01:26:37] <NodeX> no I didn't
[01:26:41] <SlexAxton> ugh
[01:26:43] <hugifrb> Hallo. I have a question to redirect_to :back. I have a form for a new object and I want redirect_to :back to this form. My problem is that in the action I create every time a new object with @object = Object.new. How can I refill the form information, when I return with the :back?
[01:26:47] <NodeX> you read from my comment that it would not work
[01:27:03] <NodeX> how is that my problem if you did that
[01:27:24] <NodeX> is the @ meant to make me stop talking or somehting
[01:27:28] <SlexAxton> "NodeX: Bad idea"
[01:27:42] <SlexAxton> what did you mean by that
[01:27:50] <SlexAxton> and saying that we should test it
[01:28:04] <SlexAxton> that we would find that it worked as expected?
[01:28:20] <SlexAxton> im just really confused about your incorrect confrontational attitude
[01:28:20] <NodeX> hugifrb : jsfiddle
[01:28:34] <NodeX> * Added SlexAxton!*@* to ignore list
[01:29:06] <SlexAxton> you have to do more than just type that
[01:29:48] <hugifrb> NodeX: oh I think it is more a rails question .... thanks
[01:29:59] <NodeX> I thought so lol
[01:32:26] <red> What tables do I need to join to retrieve files attached to a node?
[01:32:50] <NodeX> lol wrong chan ?
[01:34:23] <red> yep oops :D
[01:34:32] <red> ctrl-x and ctrl-z so close to each other :)
[01:34:52] <red> *boggled about new DB structure of D7*
[01:35:09] <NodeX> dunno what that is lol
[01:35:56] <red> Drupal stuff, used to be easy to get attached file list of a "page", but now everything is entitites and I'm losing the logic chain of how to match a file entity based on the pages id :)
[01:36:12] <NodeX> drupal :(
[01:36:16] <red> <3
[01:36:41] <red> Event went to Drupalcon london this year, awesome seminars (but Croydon was an awful place)
[01:37:04] <NodeX> yer Croydon sucks
[01:37:08] <NodeX> used to live near there
[01:37:19] <red> amen
[01:37:54] <red> I still don't understand the costs of public transportation tho, some illogical shit in the train ticket pricing :D
[01:38:09] <NodeX> London is just expensive full stop
[01:38:17] <red> yup
[01:38:31] <alaing> NodeX: i agree
[01:38:33] <red> once at croydon we bought a 5 day ticket for less £ than it cost to travel from airport to there
[01:38:37] <ravenzz> NodeX do you live in London?
[01:38:42] <red> and it was a 6 zones
[01:39:06] <NodeX> No moved about 10 years ago
[01:39:11] <NodeX> live near Manchester now
[01:39:21] <ravenzz> oh not that "far"
[01:39:34] <NodeX> nah, 3 hours on train
[01:39:48] <ravenzz> is $2000 a good salary?
[01:39:54] <NodeX> for what ?
[01:40:00] <ravenzz> for living there
[01:40:11] <NodeX> in London ... no
[01:40:19] <NodeX> if you mean per month ...
[01:40:26] <ravenzz> yes
[01:40:42] <alaing> i work in london and used to live there
[01:40:42] <NodeX> a standard factory worker would get about £10 per hour
[01:40:52] <NodeX> 10*39*4
[01:40:54] <red> if you are a cleaner than then yes
[01:40:55] <red> ;)
[01:41:10] <alaing> I'm a civil servant and I earn less than £2000 doing web dev
[01:41:12] <NodeX> so it's not much more than an unskilled labour wage
[01:41:27] <NodeX> ouch
[01:41:35] <alaing> yip
[01:41:38] <NodeX> the cost of living is soooo high down there
[01:41:53] <NodeX> it's not to bad up here
[01:42:04] <alaing> but there are pros such as i dont have to go into the office everyday so save on travel
[01:42:06] <ravenzz> eh i got an offer of $2000/month for an internship there
[01:42:18] <NodeX> £2000 for internetship is good
[01:42:37] <NodeX> my last job up here was £45,000 PA
[01:42:52] <NodeX> I left it 3 years ago to start my own
[01:42:52] <alaing> i wish
[01:42:53] <alkemann> from $.ajax i get back a bunch of <tr>, how do i best count them in the success callback?
[01:43:04] <Raniy> Could anyone help me understand why http://pastebin.com/GcqdjkdN isnt working?
[01:43:17] <ravenzz> I see
[01:43:37] <alaing> NodeX: was that permanent?
[01:43:51] <NodeX> yes
[01:44:03] <NodeX> was there for 6 years - started on £20k
[01:44:21] <alkemann> Raniy: because bar isnt a defined variable? put in in quoutes
[01:44:24] <alaing> man some people just have all the luck
[01:44:37] <alaing> NodeX: what were the hours like?
[01:44:38] <NodeX> alkemann : you can regex or you can write to the dom and use size()
[01:44:47] <NodeX> 9-5 monday to friday
[01:45:04] <alaing> NodeX: and how many hours overtime?
[01:45:21] <NodeX> about 1 day a month (if we were in crisis)
[01:45:34] <NodeX> 4 weeks holiday too
[01:45:40] <alaing> god dammit i need to look for a better job
[01:45:48] <NodeX> I did everything though
[01:45:53] <Raniy> Aha. Yeah thats it... Doh. Thanks alke
[01:45:59] <NodeX> I was a whole IT dept lol
[01:46:11] <alaing> lol same here lol
[01:46:17] <alkemann> NodeX: can't use jquery on it before it is written to DOM?
[01:46:29] <NodeX> alkemann : no
[01:46:46] <ravenzz> why not?
[01:46:51] <alkemann> makes sense, but inconvenient
[01:46:58] <NodeX> but you can write it then remove
[01:46:58] <YamahaAlex37> where can i go to learn specifics about using jquery mobile
[01:47:26] <NodeX> alkemann : you can use jQuery but you can't do what you want to do without the DOM nodes existing
[01:47:55] <NodeX> alaing : I thought all civil stuff would be outsourced
[01:49:08] <alaing> it is to a degree.
[01:50:15] <NodeX> YamahaAlex37 : #jquerymobile is if's still alive
[01:51:38] <alkemann> uhm. testing str.match() in chrome console and it finds one for 'tr' , but nothing for '/tr/g' - it seems it doesnt take the delimiter?
[01:52:08] <NodeX> can you jsfiddle the string you are testing
[01:52:09] <alkemann> ah dont string the pattern. doah
[01:53:10] <ravenzz> alkemann http://jsfiddle.net/BVUXB/
[01:54:28] <YamahaAlex37> NodeX, its pretty dead
[01:54:39] <YamahaAlex37> i cant seem to find any jqmobile examples or tutorials
[01:54:40] <tPl0ch> Hello, I have a multiple=multiple select that I observe via the click event. I thought I could return false when some condition is false and the option would not be selected, but that's not the case. How would I achieve that?
[01:54:41] <NodeX> is this a new feature ... i'm sure in 1.4 you could not manipulate / count objects not int he dom
[01:54:52] <YamahaAlex37> arent we on jq 1.8?
[01:55:02] <NodeX> UI = 1.8
[01:55:04] <Putr> hey! I'm looking for a jquery plugin that would enable me to transform a large unordered list to be scrolable within a smaller containter
[01:55:49] <NodeX> tPl0ch : try event.preventDefault()
[01:55:58] <NodeX> ( if it's possible
[01:56:17] <blackspotwiggins> alkemann, $("tr", response).length should work
[01:56:18] <tPl0ch> Putr, well, can't CSS do exactly that on it's own without the overhead of a jquery plugin
[01:56:33] <blackspotwiggins> why would you do string magic when you have a perfect dom parser (the browser) available
[01:56:51] <Putr> tPl0ch: lol good point :) I'm a php coder and they give me this to do, afcorse i'm gonna forget about css
[01:57:14] <NodeX> lol
[01:57:46] <Raniy> Lets say Ive got an Iframe. Now I dont care whats in the frame... But I would like to execute from a Jquery event everytime the contents of the frame change. IE a link is clicked or what have you. Which event would I be using?
[01:58:03] <blackspotwiggins> Raniy, load
[01:58:08] <NodeX> you can use load()
[01:58:11] <Putr> howtos: Stop spamming me!

[02:08:36] <aaronmcadam> tPl0ch: what do u want to do
[02:09:35] <NodeX> I dont think you will be able to do it then
[02:09:49] <Spadeski> Dude jplayer is so gay
[02:12:51] <tPl0ch> aaronmcadam, I want a multiple select option to not be selected if the count is greater than a default value. http://pastebin.com/AfSkf55e (It's php code, the json object style notations will get substituted by a symfony widget.

[02:15:54] <aaronmcadam> ?php
[02:15:55] <bot-t> You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.

[02:20:37] <YamahaAlex37> do you think its a big deal to include jquery and jquery ui with a mobile game?
[02:21:24] <tPl0ch> aaronmcadam, http://jsbin.com/itivas/2

[02:23:19] <aaronmcadam> yip
[02:24:21] <aaronmcadam> tPl0ch: call event.preventDefault() before ur alert
[02:24:26] <aaronmcadam> alert is a blocking action
[02:25:16] <tPl0ch> aaronmcadam, nope, no difference
[02:26:08] <aaronmcadam> or maybe you could trigger a blur
[02:26:08] <aaronmcadam> or another event that will deselect the option
[02:26:38] <aaronmcadam> I know a little bit of german, but could u plz put ur comments in english

[04:17:10] <ravenzz> 10 mins ago I was getting a shower
[04:17:20] <Spadeski> NodeX click home the shoutbox is ajax and doesnt load the x when onhover even is called
[04:17:32] <NodeX> where is your JS bind ?
[04:17:33] <Spadeski> does if i dont use ajax though
[04:17:37] <NodeX> and is it a live() bind ?
[04:17:37] <Spadeski> waitup
[04:17:41] <Spadeski>  no
[04:17:52] <phrozen_> ravenezz it was 53 min ago ;)
[04:18:07] <ravenzz> phrozen_ oh you are the guy of load()
[04:18:23] <NodeX> try a live bind inluess you are loading the content then a listner in the ajax response
[04:18:35] <hugifrb> One short question: I use $('element:first').clone().insertBefore(...) to copy a form field. When I now try to select all $('element') I get only the original and not the all (original and copy). how can I get all elements in a array?
[04:18:40] <aaronmcadam> do not do it that way
[04:18:51] <aaronmcadam> do NOT bind events in ajax callbacks ffs
[04:18:53] <Spadeski> NodeX havent made it to bind or live even though ive heard alot

[04:19:45] <Spadeski>  Nice
[04:20:09] <ravenzz> phrozen_ well on mScripts.js you select $('#content') that doesn't exists
[04:20:15] <Spadeski> Example http://pastebin.com/hYAMfP6L
[04:20:22] <Spadeski> NodeX Example ^^
[04:21:36] <ravenzz> phrozen_ http://pastie.org/2670354
[04:22:18] <NodeX> gimme 2 mins Spadeski
[04:22:27] <Spadeski> NodeX No problem
[04:22:27] <phrozen_> ravenezz - like now?
[04:23:29] <ravenzz> phrozen_ yep?
[04:23:39] <phrozen_> ravenezz still nothing
[04:23:45] <phrozen_> test.html have asdf text
[04:24:15] <NodeX> Spadeski : you need a live bind
[04:24:28] <ravenzz> phrozen_ i can se asdf on the page
[04:24:29] <ravenzz> :o
[04:24:52] <NodeX> $('.shoutbox_post_content').hover(function() --> instead : $('.shoutbox_post_content').live('hover',function()...
[04:25:03] <Spadeski> NodeX mind for example oh
[04:25:10] <Spadeski> oh*
[04:25:13] <NodeX> or you can use delegate but as we found he other day it can be weird with malformed html
[04:25:21] <NodeX> whereas live() isn't
[04:25:37] <phrozen_> ravenezz ... ok thank you :) just web page was cached
[04:25:40] <NodeX> live() listens to current and future nodes of the seelctor
[04:25:45] <Spadeski> NodeX Why use live why wouldnt it work with the regularapi ?
[04:25:54] <Spadeski> just keep answering them before i ask!
[04:25:55] <Spadeski> lol
[04:26:22] <NodeX> because the node isn't in the DOM at bind time (runtime)
[04:27:03] <Spadeski> live('hover',function()oh
[04:27:08] <Spadeski> dude i hate that
[04:27:21] <NodeX> why ?
[04:27:35] <Spadeski> No I mean that I push up and it reenters my old text
[04:27:36] <Spadeski>  lol
[04:28:06] <NodeX> it's the bets part of IRC... my client is stuck overwriting old text atm
[04:28:44] <NodeX> kljadsadssd
[04:28:44] <Spadeski> Yeah seems that code I have didnt work in the first place too
[04:28:49] <NodeX> yay fixed
[04:28:59] <NodeX> where are you adding the listner ?
[04:29:36] <Spadeski> listener for what ?
[04:29:43] <NodeX> the hover()
[04:29:57] <NodeX> is it in an ajax request or in a doc ready block on the page callee
[04:30:12] <Spadeski> oh request
[04:30:39] <NodeX> as aaronmcadam said it's bad to put it int he request  - only do it if you absolutely have to
[04:31:00] <NodeX> put the live() on the page that calls the shoutbox in a doc ready
[04:31:49] <Spadeski> Oh yeah thats what im doing I just dont understand everything ya sayin man
[04:31:51] <Spadeski> tired
[04:32:09] <aaronmcadam> no, NodeX don't do it at all
[04:32:12] <GreyTrilby> ok, i'm going mad here...
[04:32:18] <NodeX> aaronmcadam : sometimes you have to
[04:32:23] <aaronmcadam> no you don't
[04:32:29] <NodeX> yes you do
[04:32:29] <aaronmcadam> sometimes u just need to learn the right way
[04:32:34] <NodeX> no not at all
[04:32:41] <aaronmcadam> ur doing it wrong
[04:32:43] <aaronmcadam> lol
[04:32:55] <NodeX> when you build complex web desktops and CRM's for a living for 8+ years believe me you have to in certain instances
[04:33:08] <Spadeski> NodeX Would you mind for a pm ?
[04:33:15] <NodeX> no probs
[04:33:23] <aaronmcadam> god help ya lol
[04:33:43] <GreyTrilby> Why, when adding an alert to a form button click, will it alert ok for $(':button') but not for $(':button#mybuttonid')?
[04:33:59] <aaronmcadam> drop the :btuton
[04:34:02] <aaronmcadam> just the id
[04:34:10] <aaronmcadam> you're over-qualifying ur selector
[04:34:11] <GreyTrilby> nope - that didn't work either!
[04:34:13] <NodeX> sometimes the nodes are to dynamic (server side logic creating ID's etc) so certain things need to be bound at runtime ... for the most part I avoind it :)
[04:34:15] <Spadeski>  GreyTrilby  or try adding a space in between ?
[04:34:19] <NodeX> avoid*
[04:34:19] <aaronmcadam> well then somethin else is wrong
[04:34:38] <GreyTrilby> that's what I though - i use the same thing in about a dozen otherpages,just can't see why it won't run in this one!
[04:34:40] <aaronmcadam> it depends on how well you know the apis
[04:34:58] <Spadeski> is that a colon in there?
[04:35:02] <aaronmcadam> hah yeah
[04:35:15] <Spadeski> why lol
[04:35:22] <aaronmcadam> idiotic tendency
[04:35:28] <Spadeski> mmm nice
[04:35:31] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:35:45] <Spadeski> aaronmcadam:  http://gotactics.net/ What im workin on
[04:35:46] <NodeX> #id = fast because it uses native document.getElementById() ... nerv over qualify on the left of a selector
[04:36:13] <aaronmcadam> because the rule is parsed right to left
[04:38:20] <Spadeski> So im bored
[04:51:16] <Spadeski> How do I limit size of resizeable item so it wont get too big ?
[04:52:42] <Zxurian> is there a way to detect when an image within the DOM is done being transfered to the clients browser?
[05:17:48] <fuchstronaut> can one think of anything better than customers not willing to pay?
[05:21:04] <ooggetuigen> somone has experience with the toggle function?
[05:21:18] <ooggetuigen> i like to untoggle all the objects before it toggles
[05:24:40] <jeffsmykil> I'm having issues triggering a select change with this code:
[05:24:58] <jeffsmykil> $("input#floorSelect").val(facilityCookieValue).trigger('change');
[05:26:21] <NodeX> does it update the val() ok ?
[05:27:14] <jeffsmykil> it seems to
[05:27:21] <jeffsmykil> but my ajax call is based on the change event
[05:27:39] <NodeX> dont forget that change() is a series of events and trigger is not allways reliable
[05:27:50] <NodeX> trigger of change that it
[05:27:52] <NodeX> is *
[05:28:21] <jeffsmykil> can you suggest a workaround>
[05:28:26] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, change is a series of events?
[05:28:28] <blackspotwiggins> wtf?
[05:30:49] <aaronmcadam> wtf are u on about
[05:31:12] <aaronmcadam> don't make broad sweeping statements without justification
[05:31:28] <aaronmcadam> when is trigger not reliable? why is change a "series of events"
[05:32:37] <jeffsmykil> so is there a way to do what I'm doing?
[05:33:13] <jeffsmykil> or not doing, as the case may be
[05:33:37] <blackspotwiggins> yes, you can trigger change on inputs
[05:33:40] <blackspotwiggins> if that's what you are asking
[05:33:48] <aaronmcadam> question is why
[05:33:58] <aaronmcadam> what are you trying to do I mean
[05:34:01] <jeffsmykil> my ajax call is made off the change of a select
[05:34:12] <aaronmcadam> right ok cool
[05:34:26] <aaronmcadam> so why do u need to trigger it?
[05:34:46] <aaronmcadam> do u have an input or something that the select depends on
[05:34:53] <jeffsmykil> because simply changing the value doesnt trigger it
[05:37:09] <jeffsmykil> not sure if that makes sense
[05:37:13] <dross> any jquery folks with G+ here?
[05:37:17] <dross> *adding peopel*
[05:39:02] <Damianos_> How can I trigger a second action from a form submission? Basically I want an xml file updated every time a new page is created. I've tried submit and bind but nothing happens. I even tried prevenDefault() and nothing is happening.
[05:39:10] <seutje> IE8 is being weird... $('#foo', '#bar').length; // 0 - $('#foo').closest('form').attr('id'); // 'bar'
[05:39:33] <jeffsmykil> IE 8 is being weird?!?
[05:39:36] * jeffsmykil acts shocked 
[05:39:38] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, is #bar one of the new html5 elements?
[05:39:47] <seutje> no, it's a <form>
[05:39:47] <blackspotwiggins> ah, sry form
[05:39:55] <blackspotwiggins> i've had issues with sections and such
[05:40:18] <blackspotwiggins> the solution is chrome frame :)
[05:40:25] <seutje> I know how silly that example looks, using 2 IDs and stuff, but still... plain weird
[05:40:25] <Spadeski> Which library do i need for datepicker ?
[05:40:48] <seutje> it's like "there is no foo in this form, but foo is a part of the form bar!"
[05:43:07] <aaronmcadam> Spadeski: ui
[05:49:33] <jarrod322> hi everyone
[05:49:41] <jarrod322> would it be possible with jquery to have an array to be global?
[05:49:46] <jarrod322> like available outside its own function?
[05:50:08] <shamrock> learn basic javascript.
[05:50:27] <shamrock> its not specifically jquery. learn about scope in javascript.
[05:50:54] <aaronmcadam> namespace ur globals
[05:51:30] <aaronmcadam> var iDontKnowJs = {}; iDontKnowJs.myGlobalArray = [1,2,3];

[06:03:13] <cambrian-re> Greetings. I am using .getJSON() to submit a form and return a JSON on a filtered dataset based on the form data. However, I am getting undefined index errors because the post data is not there. What am I doing wrong here: https://gist.github.com/bf288e5bdbe20ef6e3af ... I appreciate your help.
[06:04:35] <NodeX> what's the error you get
[06:05:07] <phrozen_> I have one more question, what is wrong with my alert on change at input http://mtechnology.itl.pl/js/ I can not see alert. This sript is in document ready section so it should "see" inpts
[06:05:40] <cambrian-re> NodeX
[06:05:47] <cambrian-re> NodeX: Notice: Undefined index: filterBy1 in ...
[06:06:04] <NodeX> thsat's a php error
[06:06:16] <jeffsmykil> prefered function for popup bubbles?
[06:06:18] <NodeX> so your script is spitting out an error and is effecting the JSON
[06:06:40] <NodeX> ergo seding back BAD json to the getJSON
[06:07:12] <cambrian-re> Yes, I know ... The problem is that the .getJSON call, which I pass the form data to, is not passing it trough the AJAX call.
[06:07:27] <Segaja> phrozen_: the load() function is async
[06:07:55] <NodeX> pastebin the whole form
[06:08:09] <NodeX> you need to listen on submit() and prevent the default action
[06:08:34] <phrozen_> Segaja ok ... thank you ... so how can I solve this problem? paste this script to the html where I have a form?
[06:09:41] <Segaja> phrozen_: the .load() function should have a complete() callback that you can use
[06:09:47] <Segaja> read the docs about it
[06:09:54] <phrozen_> ok I will try
[06:10:03] <Segaja> also it is normal that you have no url in your load() function?
[06:10:20] <phrozen_> no it is not
[06:10:45] <Segaja> and the e at the end of line 10 just looks wrong
[06:10:52] <cambrian-re> NodeX: https://gist.github.com/78c7aa4c205b27537db2
[06:11:00] <phrozen_> but it is temp solution ... I am learning jQuery becouse I forgot 90% functions
[06:11:10] <rapha> Hi all!
[06:11:18] <cambrian-re> NodeX: .getJSON call is line 324 ...
[06:11:44] <rapha> There seem to be quite a number of forum threads on multiple drop targets, but all without answers. Is it at all possible to have multiple drop targets, and if so, is there an example of it somewhere?
[06:11:57] <Segaja> phrozen_: anyway... http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:12:29] <rapha> (i.e. a table with each cell being its own drop target)
[06:12:56] <Segaja> phrozen_: ah my mistake. your syntax is fine
[06:14:05] <phrozen_> ok so I can input to complete this function which is checking is load complete? 2 sec and I will try show what I mean
[06:15:51] <phrozen_> no probably it is wrong becouse load is not working now ;)
[06:17:37] <phrozen_> hmmm Segaja do you know how solve it?
[06:17:39] <cambrian-re> NodeX: Do you see any issues with how I am passing the form data?
[06:17:57] <Segaja> phrozen_: i would try this (untestet): http://pastie.org/private/5k8cvapgsq72ovlht5wqmw
[06:18:35] <Segaja> phrozen_: the complete is an anoymous function, so it would be $('#invoiceForm').load('invoice_address_form.html #invoiceForm', function() { ... });
[06:19:06] <phrozen_> I think this is ok ...
[06:19:10] <phrozen_> thank you
[06:19:55] <Segaja> as long as you are not just copying it but also understand it :)
[06:21:53] <phrozen_> Segaja ok :) it is understoodable :P
[06:22:56] <kborchers> phrozen_: what is the issue you're having?
[06:24:16] <phrozen_> I am programming in python and I do not want repeat yourself, so I prepared 2 kinds of forms with inheritattion and now I need a bit of jQuery
[06:24:32] <phrozen_> http://mtechnology.itl.pl/js/
[06:24:41] <phrozen_> I want to learn it but it is quite hard for me :)
[06:25:17] <kborchers> so is the issue that binding to the change event of your inputs isn't working?
[06:25:33] <Segaja> it works now
[06:25:43] <Segaja> his error was that load() is working async
[06:26:05] <Segaja> and therefore at the time the .change() was bound the forms wheren't there yet
[06:26:40] <phrozen_> yea in this event I need t check isUpdated  now :D and I am trying to do it alone to understand jQuery API :)
[06:31:12] <jeffsmykil> how would i notate parent of this
[06:31:27] <Segaja> .parentNode() ?
[06:31:31] <Segaja> aeh .parent()
[06:31:40] <phrozen_> .parent()
[06:31:48] <jeffsmykil> ah right
[06:31:51] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[06:31:52] <Segaja> .parentNode() was the DOM way :D
[06:32:06] <gnarf> not really
[06:32:11] <gnarf> because its not a function
[06:32:12] <gnarf> :)
[06:32:20] <phrozen_> Segaja ... is it corect notyfication $(this).next('#id_isUpdated').val()
[06:32:24] <Oldskool> Hey guys, I'm trying to exclude one td from triggering it's parent tr event. I now have: jQuery("tr").not("td.actions").click(function() { /* event here */ }); .. but it's still binding to that td aswell
[06:32:29] <Segaja> right. ok i didn't do plain DOM in a long time :D
[06:32:30] <jeffsmykil> var title = $(this).parent().class();
[06:32:37] <runemb> Hi all, how can I execute a jQuery function when a PHP file download is started or completed? I initiate the file download with HTTP headers.
[06:32:47] <Oldskool> .. any suggestions for alternatives?
[06:33:02] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: .class() isn't a jQuery function... perhaps you want .prop( "className" )?
[06:33:11] <jeffsmykil> that would probably work
[06:33:16] <Segaja> Oldskool: e.prventDefault() ?
[06:33:34] <Segaja> phrozen_: what do you want to do?
[06:33:39] <jeffsmykil> would attr(class) also work?
[06:33:40] <Segaja> next() gives you the next sibling
[06:33:55] <gnarf> runemb: you wont get much traction with that idea
[06:34:14] <gnarf> runemb: its just not very possible to monitor the status of a file download via JavaScript
[06:34:28] <phrozen_> To do all what I need 1. Check isUpdated in form which was updated, then when someone leave the form I have to send post
[06:35:06] <runemb> gnarf: since I'm doing force download of file with HTTP headers - can I listen for HTTP header change?
[06:35:23] <phrozen_> so I have to check correct check box
[06:35:26] <phrozen_> first
[06:35:52] <Segaja> phrozen_: since you use some of the same form twice you have one ID two times in your html source. this is not a good idea
[06:35:56] <danzik17> Oldskool: Well, .not won't do a thing in your selector.  The 'tr' selector won't match 'td.actions', so your .not is just going to return the same set
[06:36:27] <phrozen_> I know but i need something like that... I have different divs which have forms
[06:36:34] <gnarf> runemb: again, not really - I looked into it a while back, its not simple...
[06:36:42] <phrozen_> so probably better idea is find parend div which have unique name
[06:36:43] <runemb> Oldskool: $('td').not('td.actions') should work
[06:37:02] <phrozen_> and then #invoiceForm form input#id_isUpdated
[06:37:11] <phrozen_> it should be nice
[06:37:13] <gnarf> phrozen_: won't work - ID's MUST BE unique
[06:37:34] <runemb> gnarf: alright, thanks, you didn't find an alternative solution?
[06:37:37] <Oldskool> runemb: I figured that too, but unfortunately the .click() event doesn't seem to bind to td
[06:37:50] <gnarf> the selector engine will crap out if they aren't and not return what you expect
[06:37:54] <Oldskool> which also makes it tough to filter on td
[06:37:56] <gnarf> phrozen_: use classes instead
[06:38:07] <gnarf> runemb: nope
[06:38:23] <phrozen_> I can not ... it is generated automatically at my system ... so I have to rebuild my forms
[06:38:32] <phrozen_> it is quite not good but ...
[06:38:39] <phrozen_> ok I will do that ...
[06:38:57] <Segaja> phrozen_: you could try to select the element by name="isUpdated"
[06:38:58] <Segaja> or something
[06:39:19] <gnarf> yeah, using attr selectors on name is your next best choice
[06:39:38] <jeffsmykil> Is there a better way to not show another popup if one is already being shown besides searching the whole dom for the popups class?
[06:39:39] <gnarf> you could also use jQuery to fix your duplicate ID issue
[06:40:32] <Segaja> phrozen_: your load function puts a div with id userForm inside a div with id userForm
[06:40:38] <jeffsmykil> i guess i could use a boolean
[06:40:38] <Segaja> seriously: fix your ids!
[06:40:59] <blackspotwiggins> phrozen_, jut curious - what system generates invalid ids by default?
[06:41:04] <blackspotwiggins> just*
[06:41:06] <harmoniser> Hi, I am a newbie having a problem getting a global var to stick. Got 11 lines of code to show. Where to post it?
[06:41:17] <blackspotwiggins> ?p @ harmoniser
[06:41:18] <bot-t> harmoniser, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:41:58] <gnarf> something like $("#theform").find("[id],[for]").each(function() { if ( this.id ) this.id = "theform_"+this.id; if ( this.htmlFor ) this.htmlFor = "theform_"+this.htmlFor; });
[06:42:45] <harmoniser> Ok it is on: http://jsfiddle.net/TMett/
[06:43:03] <harmoniser> Checkpoint1 prints out the var but not Checkpoint2
[06:43:17] <blackspotwiggins> harmoniser, var declares it in current scope
[06:43:29] <blackspotwiggins> which is the anonymous function you pass to setinterval
[06:43:32] <blackspotwiggins> so its not global
[06:43:40] <Segaja> declare it outside the setTimeout
[06:43:46] <harmoniser> where should I declare the var?
[06:43:49] <harmoniser> ah
[06:43:50] <harmoniser> ok
[06:44:23] <blackspotwiggins> or use window.globalname  = ''
[06:45:34] <morphine> Guys, best JQuery validation plugins? I had some recommendations a while ago from people in the channel, but lost the bookmarks

[06:46:52] <harmoniser> Segaja: Hm, still nothing
[06:49:12] <Derppy> I'm doing something like this: var productData = {}; $.ajax(... success:function(result){productData = result}); ... console.log(productData), and the object seems to lose it's properties when I move it to the global variable. I'm only getting the prototypes.
[06:49:27] <Segaja> harmoniser: http://pastie.org/private/dovs5llr9ih69csl64xkrw
[06:49:31] <harmoniser> ok works
[06:50:11] <Derppy> If I log it in the submit function, it seems fine. When I log it in a function afterwards, it only has some prototype data
[06:50:23] <Derppy> *in the success function
[06:52:11] <aaronmcadam> oh jesus
[06:52:32] <aaronmcadam> ?ftjq @ Derppy you're missing the point of asynchronous programming :)

[06:53:03] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[06:53:03] <aaronmcadam> :D
[06:53:36] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: of course u can do that
[06:53:48] <aaronmcadam> just drop the quotes between the selectors
[06:53:55] <jeffsmykil> o rlly
[06:53:57] <jeffsmykil> cool
[06:54:33] <jeffsmykil> i thought you could but couldnt get it to work
[06:54:40] <aaronmcadam> why?
[06:54:45] <aaronmcadam> it's just a set of elements
[06:55:18] <jeffsmykil> my guess is that I'm a moron
[06:55:20] <aaronmcadam> tho for multiple elements it's best to use ?see delegate
[06:55:21] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Event Object - jQuerys event system normalizes the event object according to W3C standards . The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler. Most properties from the original event are copied ov... http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[06:55:30] <aaronmcadam> christ
[06:55:39] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, your bot-fu is weak :)
[06:55:48] <aaronmcadam> I'm usually good
[06:56:00] <blackspotwiggins> we all have those days ;)
[06:56:01] <jeffsmykil> my penis is usually 12"  I SWEAR
[06:56:05] <aaronmcadam> tryin to do too many things at once
[06:56:23] <aaronmcadam> and yeah ur moron rating is pretty high
[06:56:25] <aaronmcadam> :p
[06:56:28] <jeffsmykil> lol
[06:56:55] <aaronmcadam> use delegate to avoid silly stuff
[06:57:12] <aaronmcadam> silly $(this).click() within a $.each() madness :)
[06:57:14] <jeffsmykil> ugh learning
[06:58:04] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, how long have you visited #jquery ?
[06:58:11] <jeffsmykil> lol
[06:58:41] <jeffsmykil> long enough to feel comfortable poking fun @ aaronmcadam
[06:58:47] <aaronmcadam> i've seen him in here for a while
[06:58:56] <dschuett> I have developed an web interface to search/listen to recorded calls within our company. I was just wondering if anyone knew any good jquery mp3 streaming plug ins that could easily be implemented into a while loop that returns a list of mp3 call recordings from MySQL?
[06:58:57] <aaronmcadam> he's such a prick :p
[06:59:08] <jeffsmykil> you <3 me and you know it
[06:59:18] <aaronmcadam> wow, have you heard of News of the World dschuett
[06:59:26] <blackspotwiggins> seems most of the energy goes towards not learning :)
[06:59:48] <dschuett> aaronmcadam: ?
[06:59:54] <aaronmcadam> why do need js or that
[06:59:56] <jeffsmykil> blackspotwiggins: I was more or less joking
[07:00:36] <blackspotwiggins> so you only more or less joked about not knowing css selectors? :P
[07:00:59] <jeffsmykil> i'm probably slightly better with css selectors than jquery :-p
[07:01:04] <jeffsmykil> just not when it's a function
[07:01:37] <blackspotwiggins> selectors are not functions, but meh
[07:01:59] <jeffsmykil> when it's .parent()?
[07:02:09] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with parent?
[07:02:22] <jeffsmykil> nothing
[07:02:22] <gnarf> .parent isn't a selector
[07:02:24] <gnarf> its a traverser
[07:02:29] <aaronmcadam> hey gnarf
[07:03:11] <gnarf> sup aaronmcadam
[07:03:15] <aaronmcadam> u alright
[07:03:35] <aaronmcadam> I think Ajax is discriminatory, it keeps talking about race conditions :(
[07:03:39] <NodeX> Safari and it's <video> support suck major donkey scrotum
[07:03:40] <gnarf> ?
[07:03:55] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: were you at jqcon? :)
[07:04:01] <aaronmcadam> nope wish i was
[07:04:08] <aaronmcadam> why?
[07:04:12] <gnarf> did you watch the dramatic bug readings? :)
[07:04:16] <aaronmcadam> nope
[07:04:17] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: what codec?
[07:04:27] <gnarf> http://www.youtube.com/user/sludge01
[07:04:35] <NodeX> can't get h264 to play but it wil play in FF via quicktime
[07:04:44] <NodeX> so I know it's not the encode lol
[07:04:45] <jeffsmykil> that's odd
[07:04:56] <NodeX> I can never be sure if it's caching an old video or not either
[07:05:00] <jeffsmykil> apples dev stuff for web is pretty good
[07:05:05] <jeffsmykil> did you reference that?
[07:05:09] <NodeX> works in chrome too
[07:05:14] <blackspotwiggins> you mean everyone hates safari, even gruber?
[07:05:37] <NodeX> good quality in chrome I must say
[07:05:45] <jeffsmykil> gruber gets paid to hate things
[07:06:29] <evildmp> Hi - is it obvious (or not) why http://dpaste.com/631466/ would throw a "TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$("#tabs").tabs')" at line 44?
[07:06:35] <evildmp> is it a namespacing error?
[07:07:57] <gnarf> evildmp: doesn't look like you're including jquery.ui.tabs.js
[07:08:05] <NodeX> holy moly that's alot of JS lol
[07:08:33] <evildmp> thanks gnarf
[07:08:51] * NodeX kills Safari and it's silly cache
[07:08:52] <evildmp> NodeX: Django admin with fancy stuff in it
[07:09:22] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: I think every browser has cache issues with images
[07:09:28] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: it's terrible
[07:09:31] <evildmp> gnarf: how did you know that was it? what did you see that was the clue?
[07:09:45] <evildmp> Safari's cache is ridiculously aggressive
[07:09:58] <NodeX> it's a video jeffsmykil
[07:10:08] <NodeX> and yes it's horrid
[07:10:19] <NodeX> a browser close and re-opn and it was still cached
[07:10:40] <evildmp> i've had Safari cache stuff so ferociously that it didn't report a server-side 500 error
[07:10:51] <evildmp> to find out whether the server actually worked I had to use a different browser
[07:10:51] <NodeX> wow
[07:11:04] <NodeX> I had FF serving a JS file I deleted 2 weeks ago the other day
[07:11:10] <jeffsmykil> lol
[07:11:15] <evildmp> could be a combination of ISP and Safari caching of course
[07:11:17] <jeffsmykil> now that's bad
[07:11:17] <NodeX> from bleeding disk cache
[07:11:22] <evildmp> ut still, ridiculous
[07:11:23] <gnarf> evildmp: "undefined is not a funciton"
[07:11:29] <jeffsmykil> evildmp:  not if its local lol
[07:11:33] <gnarf> evildmp: means that $.fn.tabs === undefined
[07:11:47] <evildmp> gnarf: thanks
[07:16:28] <harmoniser> When I make a call to a server with for instance $.getJSON('json.php?mode=live', function(data) { will the code wait for the result of that function or just continue?
[07:16:49] <NodeX> ajax is async by default
[07:17:09] <NodeX> you can make it synchronous (wait for a response) but it defeats the purpose of the "A" in ajax
[07:17:24] <harmoniser> So how can I be sure to pick up the var received in the line following that function?
[07:17:55] <harmoniser> I mean received in that function
[07:17:57] <NodeX> you can't unless you make it synchronous or set the var globaly on the server side
[07:18:05] <aaronmcadam> yeah setting it to synchronous is just glossing over evented programming
[07:18:09] <NodeX> which still isn't gaurunte4ed
[07:18:20] <aaronmcadam> ?ajax101
[07:18:20] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[07:19:03] <aaronmcadam> harmoniser: use Deferreds or callback
[07:19:03] <Robbington> Hey, I have a table of clickable event, when one is clicked it appends a div next to it. Why is it that clicking the same event appends the div to all the a tags in order?
[07:19:18] <aaronmcadam> harmoniser: danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/
[07:19:24] <harmoniser> But what then is the proper/usual way of picking up and handling vars from a server?
[07:19:30] <Robbington> for instance $('a').click(function(){ $(this).append("<div class='event_choice' ></div>"); });
[07:19:48] <NodeX> MP4Box -inter 500 foo.avi
[07:19:49] <NodeX> oops
[07:19:50] <aaronmcadam> ?p ' Robbington
[07:19:51] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:20:23] <larsemil> Robbington: function (element){ $(element).append might help?
[07:20:24] <Raniy> Does http://pastebin.com/0UePxMWy Look 'okay'?
[07:20:33] <Ivru> Hi. Is it possible to load a new page from a datafilter ?
[07:20:43] <aaronmcadam> larsemil: that's misleading
[07:20:59] <aaronmcadam> larsemil: the param that gets passed to an event callback is event, not the element
[07:21:10] <aaronmcadam> the element would be event.target or this
[07:21:30] <objNoob> Does anyone see anything wrong with my datepicker instantiation? It's disabled and show the month of March... pastebin.com/WDeEk04D
[07:21:34] <objNoob> Thanks...
[07:22:26] <larsemil> aaronmcadam: true. sry.
[07:22:45] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[07:22:48] <ccmonsters> hey guys, so I am doing this widget, and i had a question about having a page put out the code that one would put on their page to use the widget. Are there any examples out there of this?
[07:22:57] <ccmonsters> just looking for some guidance on the best practice
[07:22:57] <aaronmcadam> just lotsa people in here takes things as gospel lol
[07:23:01] <Robbington> Its a dynamically generated table from a database, so all the classes are 'off'
[07:23:30] <hemanth> trying to get the child divs http://jsfiddle.net/Ln9kd/
[07:23:39] <aaronmcadam> ccmonsters: do u mean a plugin?
[07:23:52] <hemanth> missing something?
[07:24:04] <ccmonsters> um, a widget? a plugin. what's the difference?
[07:24:31] <ccmonsters> this would be a widget that someone puts on their page, and it displays some data from another site/web service
[07:24:31] <aaronmcadam> well a widget is just a widget, a plugin can be anything
[07:24:36] <ccmonsters> so , a widget.
[07:24:38] <aaronmcadam> right cool
[07:24:42] <aaronmcadam> but is it a jquery plugin
[07:25:01] <aaronmcadam> or just something that depends on jquery
[07:25:35] <ccmonsters> just something that ideally I would do in jquery.
[07:25:43] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:25:53] <ccmonsters> i assume i could use the widget factory...?
[07:26:16] <aaronmcadam> the jq ui one?
[07:26:51] <ccmonsters> yea....
[07:27:24] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:27:49] <ccmonsters> not sure how much overhead jquery,jqueryui adds in overhead to this widget though :|
[07:27:52] <aaronmcadam> generally it's not a good idea to have too much dependant markup, or at least have the classes configurable
[07:28:32] <ccmonsters> oops, double speak there lol
[07:28:34] <aaronmcadam> i.e. look at jQuery Tools. that is how NOT to write a jQuery plugin API
[07:28:47] <ccmonsters> jquery tools, hmm
[07:28:54] <aaronmcadam> sucks great big balls
[07:29:02] <ccmonsters> lol
[07:29:05] <ccmonsters> does it really?
[07:29:08] <aaronmcadam> it's fucking awful
[07:29:10] <aaronmcadam> yes
[07:29:19] <ccmonsters> why the fuck am I looking at this again ?
[07:29:24] <seutje> lol
[07:29:35] <aaronmcadam> hahah for how not to release jQuery widgets
[07:29:41] <ccmonsters> haha
[07:29:46] <aaronmcadam> ;)
[07:30:02] <ccmonsters> ok, naw, fuck that. I dont need to waste my time with that mess haha. I dont even want to look into that shit
[07:30:07] <aaronmcadam> invariably people will need to customise your widget
[07:30:25] <ccmonsters> Yes, I know how to do plugin style options with $.extend and all that
[07:30:28] <aaronmcadam> probably beyond what u thought was useful for yourself :)
[07:30:30] <ccmonsters> lol
[07:30:34] <ccmonsters> haha, probably
[07:30:35] <aaronmcadam> yep yep cool
[07:31:02] <ccmonsters> I've got a prototype from some douche that is decent in many regards, but absolutely HORRIBLE from a management, efficiency standpoint
[07:31:08] <aaronmcadam> well why don't u whack together a good demo page, some good api docs and post it back on here for us to look
[07:31:12] <Robbington> I have a list of elements with the same class. when you click one it should append a div on the end, but clicking the same link more than once appends the div the next element with the same class and again and again etc. How can I stop this?
[07:31:23] <surial> jQuery is acting in a non-deterministic fashion. I'm trying to make stable headers in a table, and the first step is to apply elem.width(elem.width()); to a bunch of TD elements, after which I'm going to detach all tbody rows and house them in a new table, which will be scrollable. However, seemingly randomly this works and doesn't work. I'm guessing jQuery's "document loaded" is firing too early. Any ideas?
[07:31:30] <seutje> key feature about jquery tools is that it includes jQuery itself!
[07:31:39] <ccmonsters> That's what I assume I'll do, and the feedback should be enough to keep me from going the jquery tools route *praytell*
[07:31:50] <aaronmcadam> that's a key feature indeed :D
[07:31:51] <surial> If I shove it all in a setTimeout() with a 1500 timeout it never fails.
[07:31:51] <ccmonsters> hah seutje . oh my
[07:32:04] <ccmonsters> timeout fail coming in...
[07:32:11] <aaronmcadam> so if u want to use a later version of jq, there ye go lol
[07:32:51] <aaronmcadam> I feel my automata module content coming back into my head
[07:33:10] <ccmonsters> wtf is that ?
[07:34:54] <makara> Hi. I'm looking for a JS routine which can give more than 360 degrees mousedown around a point
[07:35:03] <makara> So if I click and hold and then move the mouse around and around a point on the screen it will just keep adding degrees and not reset to zero when I pass 360 degrees every time
[07:36:11] <ccmonsters> ? demo @ makara
[07:36:11] <bot-t> makara, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:36:18] <ccmonsters> or provide some links of some sort.
[07:36:41] <quicksilver> sounds like a simple enough problem
[07:36:55] <quicksilver> store current degrees in mousemove in a variable
[07:37:14] <quicksilver> and if current degrees is more than 180 away from new degrees, add enough multiples of 360
[07:37:21] <quicksilver> (each iteration of mousemove)
[07:37:43] <makara> i'
[07:37:50] <makara> i'm looking for links myself
[07:39:00] <makara> it must be able to go backwards too
[07:39:35] <DualDetroit> What up mothas!!! Yeah, you know it!!!! Dual Detroit be in the hou-www-se!
[07:40:44] <ccmonsters> hahah
[07:40:46] <ccmonsters> sup DD
[07:40:54] <makara> i could divide into 4 quadrants and then detect where the mouse was in the last one
[07:41:13] <makara> just thought I saw this done before....somewhere
[07:41:15] <DualDetroit> So, what happens if I put jquery in my jquery? Specifically, I use $ inside my jquery plugin: jQuery.fn.funplugin = function() { $("bodu }
[07:41:17] <quicksilver> I think my description works fine for backwards and forwards.
[07:41:27] <quicksilver> but it's a programming question not jquery related :)
[07:41:53] <jeffsmykil> whats the function to check the type of variable?
[07:41:54] <DualDetroit> Actually:: jQuery.fn.funplugin = function() { $("body").text("Oh yeah! Droppin some jquery in my jquery!")
[07:42:00] <DualDetroit> jeffsmykil: typeof
[07:42:16] <quicksilver> DualDetroit: wrap your whole plugin fine in (function($) { ... all code here ... }) (jQuery)
[07:42:19] <surial> Okay, I figured out the problem with the indeterminism. It depends on whether the images are cached or not. Is there a way to WAIT until running some javascript until certain images are loaded?
[07:42:25] <DualDetroit> jeffsmykil: But that's just plain old ECMAScript
[07:42:26] <surial> I guess I can hardcode width/height, too.
[07:42:42] <jeffsmykil> ty
[07:43:07] <aaronmcadam> DualDetroit: you're *extending* jQuery
[07:43:16] <DualDetroit> quicksilver: That sounds reasonable, but what happens if you don't? Because this does actually work.
[07:43:26] <DualDetroit> right
[07:43:35] <aaronmcadam> so you can just use jQuery
[07:43:44] <GeO`> hey
[07:43:45] <quicksilver> DualDetroit: then you have written a plugin which won't work for people who use jQuery.noconflict
[07:43:49] <makara> quicksilver, not sure I understand your method?
[07:43:55] <quicksilver> DualDetroit: as you are assuming a global $ will exist.
[07:43:59] <GeO`> is there a way to copy something into the user's clipboard ?
[07:44:01] <aaronmcadam> what if u just use an internal reference
[07:44:02] <DualDetroit> quicksilver: I guess so :|
[07:44:12] <aaronmcadam> var $j = jQuery;
[07:44:15] <quicksilver> makara: recalculate current rotation every time mousemove is called.
[07:44:18] <aaronmcadam> or just use "jQuery"
[07:44:36] <quicksilver> makara: assume it's not possible to move more than 180 between calls to mousemove
[07:44:48] <quicksilver> makara: adjust by multiples of 360 as necessary.
[07:44:49] <aaronmcadam> yes
[07:45:01] <aaronmcadam> DualDetroit: this is what you do, u wrap it in a closure
[07:45:13] <DualDetroit> aaronmcadam: I see.
[07:45:38] <DualDetroit> aaronmcadam: And I'm also using another one of my jquery plugins inside my jquery plugin.
[07:45:38] <aaronmcadam> DualDetroit: (function ( $ ) { .... use $ in here to reference jquery })( jQuery )
[07:46:45] <makara> quicksilver, I want to keep track of the number of degrees this thing has turned
[07:46:49] <quicksilver> yes.
[07:46:59] <quicksilver> makara: I know. And that is what my answer is sketching out.
[07:47:09] <quicksilver> DualDetroit: sounds better when aaronmcadam says it, doesn't it ? ;)
[07:47:18] <GeO`> is there a way to copy something into the user's clipboard ?
[07:47:28] <aaronmcadam> hha
[07:47:41] <quicksilver> makara: you store current rotation in a variable. You update it each mousemove event. YOu assume it's impossible to move more than 180 degrees per event, and therefore you adjust by multiples of 360 as necessary.
[07:47:47] <quicksilver> I don't think I'll say it again. Three times is enough.
[07:47:55] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[07:47:59] <aaronmcadam> i like ur style quicksilver
[07:48:17] <aaronmcadam> or just use the rotation plugin makara  ;)
[07:48:22] <quicksilver> today I'm mostly being sarcastic in IRC channels
[07:48:27] <aaronmcadam> endtroll :)
[07:48:33] <quicksilver> tomorrow I will happy-slap some pensioners.
[07:49:39] <jeffsmykil> YOU ARE IN THE ARRAY STOP RETURNING -1!
[07:49:47] <jigal_> if i have this  $("ul.index li a").click(function(e){ how can i know which li a was selected?
[07:49:58] <CantUnplug> e.target
[07:50:19] <CantUnplug> ^jigal_
[07:50:50] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: give us a wee fiddle
[07:51:02] <jeffsmykil> not without dinner first
[07:51:23] <ccmonsters> should I write my 'widget' with the plugin style?
[07:51:32] <ccmonsters> fn.mywidget = blah blah
[07:51:49] <jigal_> CantUnplug: tnx very much
[07:51:54] <aaronmcadam> that's all ui does anyway
[07:52:07] <ccmonsters> talking to me aaronmcadam ?
[07:52:09] <quicksilver> jigal_: or, this
[07:52:15] <aaronmcadam> yus
[07:52:19] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: just a tease... var index = ($.inArray(numericalTitle, room[i].name));
[07:52:24] <makara> thanks
[07:52:26] <ccmonsters> what you mean that's all it does..?
[07:52:43] <aaronmcadam> jeffsebring: is name a string?
[07:52:46] <CantUnplug> quicksilver - yes, $(this) works.. just be aware of scope when in nested functions/etc.
[07:52:55] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam:  both ints I checked
[07:53:04] <aaronmcadam> why is .name an int?
[07:53:10] <aaronmcadam> it implies it should be a string
[07:53:11] <jeffsmykil> wait no name is an array of ints
[07:53:21] <jeffsmykil> room is an object
[07:53:28] <aaronmcadam> well then how can it test an array inside an array
[07:53:36] <johnline3> yo dawg
[07:53:38] <aaronmcadam> you'd probably need to $.each em
[07:53:40] <aaronmcadam> or for
[07:53:41] <quicksilver> CantUnplug: in nested event handles you might also have two nested "e"s ;) but it's a fair point.
[07:53:41] <aaronmcadam> loop
[07:53:57] <jeffsmykil> ive done this before with similar syntax with the same object
[07:53:57] <NodeX> if one doesn't have an iphone is there a way (without a MAC) that one can see how websites act when scaled
[07:54:01] <CantUnplug> true.. that was more for jigal_
[07:54:03] <jeffsmykil> and it is inside a for lppp
[07:54:17] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: iPod Touch!
[07:54:29] <jigal_> CantUnplug: i prefer e.target
[07:54:31] <NodeX> without any additional hardware lol
[07:54:31] <jigal_> tnx
[07:55:10] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: certainly there is some web service
[07:55:17] <jeffsmykil> that lets you see a screenshot
[07:55:41] <NodeX> it's more a video I am after viewing
[07:55:53] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: I don't think inArray can check for whole arrays being inside an array
[07:55:55] <NodeX> Why do Apple have to be such idiots with their SDK's
[07:56:03] <jeffsmykil> lol
[07:56:08] <NodeX> they are worse than M$ with that crap
[07:56:16] <aaronmcadam> of course i don't know what u are trying to do
[07:56:20] <jeffsmykil> i cant run visual studio in os x
[07:56:35] <NodeX> I wouldnt want to jeffsmykil :P
[07:56:44] <aaronmcadam> good point
[07:57:02] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: if ($.inArray((FacilityId[i]), roomsCondensed) == -1) {
[07:57:03] <jeffsmykil> works
[07:57:08] <jeffsmykil> oh wait
[07:57:10] <jeffsmykil> fuck
[07:57:15] <aaronmcadam> are u sure
[07:57:26] <jeffsmykil> yeah because thats not the object lol
[07:57:41] <jeffsmykil> i need to read it into it's own array
[07:57:47] <aaronmcadam> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.inArray
[07:57:56] <goldstar> hey guys, i am trying to append some google analytics code to my button onclick event. The problem is the anchor executes before the google request can be made to the server. How do I overcome this ?
[07:58:09] <CantUnplug> NodeX http://www.winmatrix.com/forums/index.php?/topic/18316-iphonebt-an-iphone-emulator-simulator-for-windows/  similar to iPhoney
[07:58:25] <jeffsmykil> why can't jquery know what im thinking!
[07:58:37] <NodeX> tried it CantUnplug ... it doesnt rescale :(
[07:58:45] <NodeX> it's more a wrapper than anything..
[07:58:47] <aaronmcadam> check source viewer
[07:59:13] <CantUnplug> NodeX are you lookign for App, or Web/Js?
[07:59:20] <NodeX> web/js
[07:59:24] <CantUnplug> there is a firefox plugin you can use too
[07:59:30] <NodeX> is there ?
[07:59:37] <NodeX> oo sounds promising
[07:59:47] <aaronmcadam> are u looking for just user agent switching?
[07:59:49] <NodeX> I just wanna make sure the site scales down and videos play
[07:59:53] <CantUnplug> or just download safari and shrink your window
[07:59:56] <CantUnplug> . maybe not..
[08:00:09] <NodeX> I can do the UA aaronmcadam
[08:00:18] <CantUnplug> http://www.ghacks.net/2008/04/21/firefox-iphone-emulator/
[08:00:24] <aaronmcadam> ah there's bookmarklets
[08:00:26] <aaronmcadam> for resizing
[08:00:37] <aaronmcadam> javascript:open(location,'iPhone:portrait','innerWidth='+(320+15)+',innerHeight='+(480+15)+',scrollbars=yes');
[08:00:43] <CantUnplug> NodeX - i havnt used, but i assume its just switching HTP headers
[08:00:52] <ccmonsters> hey aaronmcadam , in the case of a widget like i'm doing, the revealing module pattern probably isn't ideal ?
[08:00:59] <aaronmcadam> why not?
[08:01:16] <aaronmcadam> how do I know? i don't know a thing about ur widget
[08:01:56] <ccmonsters> I guess RMP is IIFE usually, so yea.
[08:02:01] <ccmonsters> just thinking outloud...
[08:02:14] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[08:02:43] <ccmonsters> immediately invoke function expression i think
[08:03:27] <jigal_> how can i empty all the contents of a div with a certain id?
[08:03:41] <ccmonsters> $('#id').empty() perhaps
[08:03:49] <aaronmcadam> ah k
[08:04:01] <jedimind> love it when questions answer themselves
[08:04:06] <aaronmcadam> immediately invoking funcs don't effect what pattern u can sue
[08:04:09] <aaronmcadam> use8
[08:04:22] <aaronmcadam> use*
[08:06:19] <tktiddle> Say i load a script with ajax, how can i run the script?
[08:06:48] <armicron> eval?
[08:06:57] <tktiddle> It get returned to the callback as a string, how do i then evaluate that as a function?
[08:07:15] <Cork[home]> ?.getScript @ tktiddle
[08:07:15] <bot-t> tktiddle, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[08:07:45] <Cork[home]> armicron. eval is evil...
[08:07:45] <tktiddle> Cork[home]: ahhh thats what im looking for!
[08:07:59] <ccmonsters> aaronmcadam: check this. Am i totally off in the way init() will work.
[08:08:13] <tktiddle> thanks armicron eveal would have worked, good to know about
[08:08:45] <Cork[home]> tktiddle: except is a horror to debug
[08:10:53] <ccmonsters> http://pastie.org/2671430
[08:10:54] <ccmonsters> oops
[08:12:03] <aaronmcadam> that's slightly off ccmonsters
[08:12:23] <aaronmcadam> why do u need an init there
[08:12:28] <aaronmcadam> the code will run itself
[08:12:38] <aaronmcadam> widget is self instantiate anyway
[08:13:04] <aaronmcadam> and you're supposed to extend defaults, not an empty object ccmonsters
[08:14:52] <aaronmcadam> right so you're not adding a jquery plugin, it's just a module then ccmonsters
[08:15:24] <Michael> Best custom scroll?
[08:15:39] <aaronmcadam> Clarify
[08:16:12] <johnline3> tinyscrollbar, flexcroll or jscrollbar
[08:16:21] <ccmonsters> dont i want to do the var widget.options = ({},defaults,custom) so that I can create the options without modifying the defaults? I thought jquery Api stated that this was a common plugin style
[08:16:42] <Michael> tinyscrollbar's code is sloppy and it actually doesn't work for me. Chrome throws a type error
[08:16:51] <aaronmcadam> cool cool
[08:16:51] <Michael> I'll check flex out, thanks man
[08:17:07] <johnline3> i think the other two require less bloated html
[08:17:21] <johnline3> jscrollbar has nice bounce animation
[08:17:28] <Michael> oh? *checking out*
[08:17:51] <johnline3> here it is on my site: http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/profile/
[08:17:53] <Michael> ? jscrollbar
[08:17:56] <Michael> thanks
[08:17:57] <bot-t> Michael, jScrollbar | jQuery Plugins - Had you ever wanted to add some custom scrollbars to your website, to scroll the contents and the default browser scrollbars just doesn't match up with your design ? Make your own scrollbar design ... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jscrollbar
[08:17:57] <aaronmcadam> johnline3, Michael : this is the best one, also newish
[08:18:00] <aaronmcadam> http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[08:18:07] <Michael> is that rails?
[08:18:18] <Michael> ha yeah that bounce is cool
[08:18:45] <aaronmcadam> looks a bit weird
[08:18:50] <aaronmcadam> bit too responsive lol
[08:19:10] <aaronmcadam> give jscrollpane a whirl too
[08:19:16] <johnline3> can adjust mousewheel sensitivity
[08:19:25] <Michael> jscrollpane's license is what bothers me about it
[08:19:30] <aaronmcadam> what is it
[08:19:44] <Michael> Some proprietary jumbo
[08:19:48] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with MIT and GPL?
[08:19:53] <aaronmcadam> what?
[08:19:57] <aaronmcadam> i think ur confused
[08:20:08] <Michael> Maybe I am
[08:20:12] <Michael> I've looked at a bunch
[08:20:27] <aaronmcadam> kk
[08:21:19] <johnline3> my jscrollbar doesnt seem to be working on touchscreens though
[08:21:26] <johnline3> probably pebcak on my behalf
[08:21:33] <johnline3> havent investigated
[08:21:40] <Michael> I just discovered that you have to use 2 fingers on the ipad
[08:21:51] <johnline3> on my site
[08:21:53] <johnline3> ?
[08:21:55] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah
[08:22:01] <Michael> no just for custom scrolls in general
[08:22:02] <aaronmcadam> that's on iphone too
[08:22:04] <Michael> so probably your site too
[08:22:06] <aaronmcadam> but nobody knows that
[08:22:17] <johnline3> oh, i'll try that
[08:22:24] <johnline3> i was on opera android though
[08:22:40] <aaronmcadam> hmm depends
[08:25:17] <DualDetroit> Yo yo yo, Dual Detroit be back in da house.
[08:25:29] * Michael finally exhales
[08:25:47] <johnline3> DETROID WATT]
[08:36:25] <shodan45> what's the right way to .trigger() the receive event on a jquery ui .sortable()?
[08:36:28] <jbrokc_> is there a way to "remove" a css property from a DOM element or do I have to reset it to it's default value?
[08:38:22] <destinydriven> I'm trying to load a page into ui tab  where the loaded page itself is loading content via ajax. Nothing is coming being returned on the request. Can someone please point me in the right direction?
[08:38:57] <Bostjan> hi
[08:39:35] <Bostjan> is it possible to get number of element that was clicked with selector lets say $("#foo a).click()
[08:39:36] <slackz> Trying to write a mouseOver event handler that, while mouseOver is true, the contents of a while loop are processed. Just not sure how to grab the mouseOver status.
[08:39:45] <Bostjan> i want to get for example number 3 was clicked
[08:40:17] <slackz> Bostjan I think: $(this).id or something?
[08:40:21] <kborchers> ?index @ Bostjan
[08:40:21] <bot-t> Bostjan, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[08:40:42] <Bostjan> huh nice
[08:40:46] <Bostjan> thanks
[08:41:41] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: How do I say this:  room[index].itemClass.length;
[08:41:48] <jeffsmykil> where itemClass is a variable?
[08:42:00] <kborchers> ?p @ slackz
[08:42:00] <bot-t> slackz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:42:13] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil:  room[index][itemClass].length;
[08:42:23] <jeffsmykil> k i had an extra .
[08:42:24] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[08:42:40] <aaronmcadam> yeah you need to use [] to egt object props programmatically
[08:42:48] <aaronmcadam> s/egt/get
[08:43:40] <jeffsmykil> perfect.  aaronmcadam thanks
[08:43:47] <slackz> kborchers : Nothing major, just trying to find out what to put in the While loop. http://pastebin.com/btGBR5q7
[08:44:09] <destinydriven> can I load an ajax page via ajax?  Is that possible? And if so . . how do I accomplish this with  ajax loading using ui-tabs?
[08:44:10] <NotHere> I do a $(selector).height(); and in chrome on first load or reload it outputs 0, but if I use a link to go from one page to another it outputs the correct height. Firefox displays 0 only if I shift-reload the page and at no other time
[08:44:19] <alkemann> is there no keypress event for backspace?
[08:44:23] <NotHere> do I do something wrong?
[08:45:24] <kborchers> slackz: that may make a user's machine explode ;) what exactly are you trying to do?
[08:45:45] <NotHere> (javascript is executed with $(document).ready())
[08:46:00] <slackz> kborchers : haha, yeah, just found that out.
[08:46:17] <Michael> alaing: 6
[08:46:18] <Michael> er
[08:46:21] <Michael> alkemann: 6
[08:46:26] <slackz> just simulate fast forwarding 3 seconds.. need to slow it down so that it's only processing every quarter second.
[08:46:27] <Michael> Might have to catch it onkeydown
[08:46:45] <Michael> actually it's 8
[08:47:12] <Michael> $(document).keydown(function(e) {e.preventDefault(); alert(e.which);});
[08:47:12] <DualDetroit> johnline3: You know it girl!
[08:48:00] <tomasm-> whats the easiest way in jquery to get a textarea to fit the content? im looking at the elastic plugin and ironically, it doesnt work on the demo....
[08:48:02] <DualDetroit> Is there any problem with having two jquery plugins in my jquery plugin, both of which I wrote?
[08:48:18] <gnarf> yo dawg, i heard you liked plugins
[08:48:18] <necromancer> hey i'm trying to extract all the inline JS i have on a page into functions in an external JS file
[08:48:29] <alkemann> Michael: thanks
[08:48:37] <necromancer> how can i pass the $(this)?
[08:49:06] <kborchers> slackz: so you already have it updating the clock somewhere else right? why not just add 3 to it once, then let that ticker that's already running do the updating. then on mouseout, subtract 3?
[08:49:06] <Michael> $(this) will be the element probably
[08:49:07] <necromancer> like if i have $('#selector').click(myFunc); and function myFunc(e) { $(this).fadeOut() } or something
[08:49:15] <necromancer> does $(this) just get carried over?
[08:49:18] <DualDetroit> necromancer: Pass $(this).get(0)
[08:49:27] <gnarf> woah
[08:49:32] * DualDetroit didn't even read the question.
[08:49:35] <gnarf> $(this).get(0) ?
[08:49:35] <necromancer> lol
[08:49:37] <necromancer> what is that
[08:49:48] <slackz> kborchers : no, this is handling that. I'm not too worried about optimizing and such. this is just a quick prototype.
[08:49:53] <necromancer> DualDetroit: i'm just basically taking a click action and putting it in its own function rather than defining it inline
[08:49:59] <gnarf> necromancer: see ?p
[08:49:59] <bot-t> necromancer, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:50:04] <alkemann> Michael: only on keydown, cant bind it to keypress on input?
[08:50:15] <gnarf> oh and yes
[08:50:19] <Michael> alkemann: With keypress the OS will have already handled it
[08:50:21] <gnarf> from your little source example
[08:50:25] <gnarf> see ?tias
[08:50:25] <bot-t> Try It And See
[08:50:26] <gnarf> :)
[08:50:31] <gnarf> it should work
[08:50:32] <tomasm-> anyone know if there is a textarea auto-resize plugin that works with textareas that do not have an explicit 'cols' set (ie width=100%)?
[08:50:45] <gnarf> the function is still called with the same "this"
[08:51:10] <johnline3> im juss waitin' for my rap career to take off
[08:51:28] <jbrokc_> how can I view what events are bound to a jQuery object?
[08:51:30] <gnarf> johnline3: good for you, whatsit gotta do with jQuery?
[08:51:37] <gnarf> jbrokc_: why?
[08:51:43] <necromancer> gnarf: thanks man
[08:51:53] <necromancer> i thought it didn't work but my cache was just fucked
[08:51:53] <necromancer> :)
[08:51:57] <necromancer> this is what i'm doing btw, https://gist.github.com/a56c2d4acc6121d95ed0
[08:51:59] <gnarf> jbrokc_: there are ways... but I don't want to give you a way to do some black magic
[08:52:10] <NotHere> the document ready event is fired in chrome before the images get loaded. How can I wait for the images before the trigger of my event?
[08:52:13] <gnarf> necromancer: eww
[08:52:15] <necromancer> it's a great way to get JS out of the markup but still gives you the control to call the functions when you need them
[08:52:16] <sadmicrowave> alright guys, I'm trying to submit an array as an input value via <form method='POST'>.  Possible? suggestions?
[08:52:17] <gnarf> necromancer: cache your selectors bro
[08:52:21] <gnarf> the $() isn't free
[08:52:29] <gnarf> var elem = $( this );
[08:52:33] <kborchers> gnarf: heyooooo
[08:52:39] <Michael> $(this)[0]
[08:52:42] <necromancer> gnarf: yeah that's probably a good idea. this was just made quickly
[08:52:53] <necromancer> Michael: that just returns the DOM object, doesn't it?
[08:52:54] <gnarf> necromancer: it would be made quicker with var elem
[08:53:03] <Michael> necolas: yes
[08:53:12] <necromancer> thanks man :) i'm refactoring right now
[08:53:14] <DualDetroit> NotHere: Check the .complete property of each img
[08:53:14] <Michael> sorry if I was out of context
[08:53:17] <necromancer> Michael: i need a jQ object :)
[08:53:22] <Michael> gotcha, n/m
[08:53:36] <NotHere> DualDetroit, how do I do that?
[08:53:38] <alkemann> Michael: thanks. working like a charm :) write ? to show help, backspace it away to hide help again :9
[08:54:15] <gnarf> also, necromancer - you are not a minifier ;)
[08:54:20] <gnarf> ( event )
[08:54:35] <necromancer> i'll name my vars however i feel like it, gnarf
[08:54:37] <necromancer> thank you though
[08:54:40] <gnarf> more obvious to future you what you're doing
[08:54:51] <gnarf> and anyone else (like me) who looks at this code ;)
[08:54:51] <necromancer> if i want to call a var fuckYouBillGates i will
[08:55:08] <necromancer> lol the only other dude who writes code on here is a 2-syllable var guy :)
[08:55:24] <gnarf> necromancer: what is "e"
[08:55:32] <gnarf> necromancer: "event" is more descriptive
[08:55:35] <necromancer> gnarf: it's this awesome drug that people take at raves
[08:55:37] <sadmicrowave> epilepsy
[08:55:42] <necromancer> oh yeah that ;)

[08:56:01] <necromancer> i'm calling it notAnEventSoDontUseItAsOne 4 u gnarf
[08:56:19] * gnarf shrugs
[08:56:24] <gnarf> style guide yo
[08:57:05] <alkemann> is keydown an event that only works on firefox?
[08:57:13] <alkemann> chrome isnt behaving the same
[08:57:15] <sadmicrowave> gnarf++ for persistently trying to spread good naming conventions
[08:57:35] <kborchers> sadmicrowave-- for kissing gnarf's ass ;)
[08:57:43] <sadmicrowave> lol
[08:57:49] <gnarf> heh
[08:58:03] <sadmicrowave> kboardshorts-+ for being semi rude
[08:58:05] <kborchers> (though i do agree with good naming)
[08:58:17] <gnarf> board shorts?
[08:58:18] <gnarf> lol
[08:58:22] <sadmicrowave> :)
[08:58:40] * gnarf presses the "popcorn" button on the sadmicrowave
[08:58:50] <kborchers> that was a while back gnarf ... forget who started it with sadistwasher and myself
[08:58:54] <DualDetroit> NotHere: You would have to write a polling function and then look through $("img"), checking the .complete property on each.
[08:59:07] <sadmicrowave> anyways - now that I have some attention - I'm trying to submit an array as an input value via <form method='POST'>.  Possible? suggestions?
[08:59:23] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: JSON
[08:59:31] <DualDetroit> Does anyone know a better way to know when all images are loaded? onLoad() is not reliable because it won't always fire if the images are cached.
[08:59:37] <NotHere> DualDetroit, Do I use attr('complete') to check for the attribute?
[08:59:40] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: also, what backend?
[08:59:46] <sadmicrowave> JSON.stringify isnt working for me - the php side returns NULL
[09:00:04] <gnarf> okay
[09:00:07] <shodan45> anyone know why .trigger('receive', ...) doesn't work on a .sortable() element?
[09:00:08] <gnarf> so like two ways
[09:00:28] <kborchers> you could just serailize it to arrayElem[]=blah&arrayElem[]=wat.... and PHP will see that as an array
[09:00:32] <DualDetroit> NotHere: It'snot an attribute
[09:00:44] <gnarf> 1: a bunch of <input type="hidden" name="something[]" value="first"><input type="hidden" name="something[]" value="second">
[09:01:09] <gnarf> if you need to use the browser to send the form post instead of ajax
[09:01:11] <NotHere> DualDetroit, sorry. I'm new to jquery/javascript. How do I check for a property?
[09:01:17] <DualDetroit> NotHere: The only way I know is to loop through all img elements with $("img").get(i).complete
[09:01:26] <gnarf> the jQuery serializeObject function should handle your arrays correctly though
[09:01:28] <NotHere> ah, ok
[09:01:30] <gnarf> ?serializeObject
[09:01:30] <bot-t> Whereas jQuery’s built-in .serializeArray() method serializes a form into an array, .serializeObject() serializes a form into an (arguably more useful) object. http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject
[09:01:50] <gnarf> hrm
[09:01:53] <gnarf> wrong func
[09:02:08] <gnarf> ?param
[09:02:08] <bot-t> jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[09:02:24] <gnarf> also
[09:02:41] <gnarf> i've often just used myArray.join(";;"); then explode() on the php side
[09:02:46] <gnarf> for other simple stuff
[09:03:26] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, kborchers - it is an array initially created in php, then upon selector click I need to send that array to my next PHP page.  so: 1) PHP creates the array as $myArray, 2) page loads and var myArray = <?php echo json_encode( $myArray ); ?>; 3) user clicks element and form is dynamically appended to body with input fields then submitted
[09:03:43] <quicksilver> gnarf: I find that PHP explode()s whatever i do, tbh.
[09:04:06] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: see ?param
[09:04:07] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[09:09:21] <DualDetroit> To complete the show, I need to pass through some arguments to the event handler.
[09:09:56] <ccmonsters> hey, gnarf , any chance you could give me some guidance on the widget I'm doing? This is what I have at the moment - just doing the foundation at this point : http://pastie.org/2671728
[09:11:30] <gnarf> ccmonsters: in a meeting atm
[09:11:39] <ccmonsters> no problem.
[09:12:24] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, I don't think param is what I'm looking for, $.param() puts the array elements into URL format, I want to put the array into a format that I can use as an input value
[09:14:03] <ccmonsters> ?demo @ sadmicrowave
[09:14:03] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:15:01] <sadmicrowave> ccmonsters, I'm asking for an idea not for someone to fix my problem, I just need some keywords to search for
[09:15:07] <sadmicrowave> unlike most people, I can use google
[09:15:32] <ccmonsters> lol
[09:15:40] <ccmonsters> $.param and $.deparam should do the trick
[09:17:21] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: so if i understand you, you just need to get that "array" from one PHP page to the other via POST, correct? In one single posted element?
[09:17:33] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, yes
[09:18:26] <kborchers> ok, so just put quotes in your JS around what you are echoing and keep it a string. Assign that to an input, and post it. then on the php side you should be able to json_decode that string into an array
[09:18:57] <ccmonsters> is he asking a php question?
[09:19:13] <destinydriven> can I load an page being populated via ajax . . . via ajax on another page?
[09:19:32] <ccmonsters> hey kborchers : building a widget, and wanted some input on what I am doing. Maybe some guidance on the style, namespacing etc. http://pastie.org/2671728
[09:19:48] <ccmonsters> so ajax a page of ajaxed content?
[09:20:05] <destinydriven> ccmonsters, yeah
[09:20:10] <ccmonsters> then again they would both be asynchronous.
[09:20:32] <destinydriven> ccmonsters, well actually its an ajax page into a ui-tab via ajax
[09:21:20] <ccmonsters> I have no clue if that would work. Depends on a few things there. The child ajax page, how do you know when the JS is rendered/content is being grabbed via ajax?
[09:21:33] <ccmonsters> kborchers: any chance you can take a peak?
[09:22:23] * kborchers peeks
[09:22:35] <destinydriven> ccmonsters, I think thats the problem. gonna see how I can work around that. May have to hard-code the ajax stuff from the child page into the ui-tab
[09:22:47] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, the array is still NULL on the next PHP page.  Do I need to JSON.stringify() or anything before submit?
[09:23:10] <ccmonsters> isn't the json already in a string sadmicrowave ?
[09:23:23] <kborchers> that was going to be my question
[09:23:23] <ccmonsters> if so, a json_decode() should do it in php
[09:24:44] <sadmicrowave> ccmonsters, I agree, and that makes total sense. But json_decode in php is returning NULL
[09:25:10] <ccmonsters> i am having an issue with the 'tweaks' part on line 35. http://pastie.org/2671728
[09:25:30] <sadmicrowave> taking json_decode() out returns "{"
[09:25:44] <ccmonsters> so it's not getting passed correctly, OR .. its not the parameter you expect
[09:27:03] <sadmicrowave> not the parameter I expect...what do you mean by that?
[09:29:51] <tomasm-> can anyone recommend a social share applet/plugin that doesnt rely upon an external site or is commercial, either? i'm looking to at least have facebook, twitter, google+, digg, delicious, email, etc
[09:30:25] <Gho5t>  $('td.ui-td-go', '#Grid').click(function (event) { <-- this is just selecting multiple tags, correct?
[09:30:45] <sadmicrowave>  $('td.ui-td-go, #Grid').click(function (event)
[09:31:25] <orolo> is there a core ajax queue or only the plugin version?
[09:31:29] <ccmonsters> sadmicrowave: it's not getting passed as you'd expect. as in its a different variable
[09:31:40] <ccmonsters> i believe there is a queue in the core
[09:31:44] <orolo> or, whats a good way to wait until all the .each(ajax) requests are finished before doing something?
[09:31:45] <alkemann> given a DL where each DT has one or more DD, how can i select only those DDs that belong to the current DT ?
[09:31:55] <alkemann> a version of siblings i hope
[09:32:16] <sadmicrowave> ccmonsters, well I'm doing a console.log() of my string and it is exactly what I expect so thats not the issue
[09:32:24] <ccmonsters> ok.
[09:32:27] <ccmonsters> ?demo
[09:32:28] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:32:57] <ccmonsters> alkemann: got a sample markup?
[09:33:04] <ccmonsters> and what determines that the 'current' dt is?
[09:33:46] <Gho5t> sadmicrowave: so what is this then  $('td.ui-td-recall a.recall', '#BrokerDealApprovalsGrid').click(function (event) {
[09:34:09] <alkemann> ccmonsters: http://jsfiddle.net/BVUXB/6/
[09:34:28] <alkemann> ccmonsters: im doing an each(f) on the DTs
[09:35:02] <kborchers> ccmonsters: just a couple of things that jump out at me immediately.
[09:35:15] <kborchers> i would name j and d something a little more descriptive
[09:35:45] <alkemann> ccmonsters: so $(this).siblings('dd'); gets me all, how to narrow it down to just the relevant ones is the Q
[09:35:50] <kborchers> i haven't done too much like this but do you really need to pass window and document in?
[09:35:59] <ccmonsters> i grabbed that from stackoverflow, and it's posing a problem if i invoke that way, because I need the user to be able to pass in some 'tweaks', so not sure how to do it with that syntax
[09:36:17] <ccmonsters> ?nextUntil

[09:36:42] <ccmonsters> probably not kborchers
[09:36:58] <Gho5t> ok so it will search within the object
[09:37:04] <alkemann> ccmonsters: sweet thanks
[09:37:09] <kborchers> i also see a potential problem with this version > j.fn.jquery if j is undefined
[09:37:09] <ccmonsters> how do I pass in 'tweaks' kborchers ?
[09:37:18] <alkemann> <3 jQuery for thinking of my needs
[09:37:40] <kborchers> ccmonsters: can you define tweaks?
[09:38:00] <Gho5t> sadmicrowave: so in my case is it the same as  $('#BrokerDealApprovalsGrid td.ui-td-recall a.recall'').click(function (event) {
[09:38:28] <Gho5t> sams as  $('td.ui-td-recall a.recall', '#BrokerDealApprovalsGrid').click(function (event) {
[09:38:35] <Gho5t> *same
[09:38:46] <ccmonsters> tweaks are jsut the user overrides
[09:39:00] <ccmonsters> options to extend with defaults for the widget customizations
[09:39:00] <ccmonsters> http://pastie.org/2671728
[09:39:08] <kborchers> ccmonsters: also, i could see users having and issue with you a) pulling in jQuery for them and b) pulling in a specific version of jQuery so it would have to be updated in source to upgrade
[09:39:16] <sadmicrowave> Gho5t, I think so. there you will be searching for 'td.ui-td-recall' and 'a.recall' within #BrokerDealApprovalGrid'
[09:39:17] <ccmonsters> kborchers: i made some stuff more description, check it out now
[09:39:34] <ccmonsters> well, i want to pull in jquery if they don't have it
[09:39:36] <sadmicrowave> Gho5t, please verify that as I've never used it in that manner
[09:39:40] <ccmonsters> for the sake of this widget.
[09:39:49] <Gho5t> ok
[09:40:04] <ccmonsters> want to make it as painfree as possible, so just pull it in
[09:40:29] <kborchers> ccmonsters: probably better to just say that this widget requires jQuery .. i would not like it doing it for me. maybe just my opinion though
[09:40:48] <ccmonsters> ok, well that aside. How do i get the 'tweaks' from the user in, with this model?
[09:41:58] <sadmicrowave> ccmonsters, lets do it this way, this is what I'm looking at right now - http://pastebin.com/gRdcpFva
[09:45:27] <kborchers> ccmonsters: having a little trouble wrapping my head around this. why are you doing everything inside of a callback instead of the IIFE itself?
[09:48:36] <kborchers> ccmonsters: so is this going to be some sort of jQuery plugin?

[10:15:13] <Junaidpv> I tried with $(this).selectedIndex; but it didn't work!
[10:15:46] <dogarrhea2> hrm. i'm having trouble wrapping my head around the "object" oriented way of doing widgets with jquery.  say you have a widget on the screen. it's got child elements and so on. whenever u drag this widget around the screen, you would like to change the ids of this element and all it's children depending on where u dragged it. what's the design for this

[10:54:36] <sc0ttkclark> i can't find any documentation on propAttr, anyone know anything about it?
[10:54:43] <sc0ttkclark> within this usage: self.element.propAttr( "readOnly" )
[10:54:57] <sc0ttkclark> specifically, used on jQuery UI Autocomplete
[10:55:30] <shamrock> is there a helper or approach to storing entire sets of visual attributes? e.g I want to do a hover which causes the border of an element to become dotted but the mouseout part of the hover should replace the border attributes to what they were before? Or do I just stash the values using data() and then restore them manually?
[10:56:10] <dross> ajpiano: ping
[10:56:54] <Junaidpv> ravenzz: thanks, it worked :)
[10:57:31] <dogarrhea2> so I can do something like var anElement = $('<div></div>');
[10:57:42] <dogarrhea2> and save that for later when i need to append it right?
[11:01:03] <jeffsmykil> when you are putting more than one css statement in a .css are the classes and values seperated by colons and the groups are sperated by commas?

[11:15:48] <dogarrhea2> i had a performance question:  How do you make a new widget instance without calling appendChild

[11:40:43] <panfist> i'm not sure what the best pattern would be to apply here. i've never done anything like this and apparently it's kind of tricky?
[11:41:01] <Gangans> search for json
[11:41:36] <panfist> i'm familiar with json but really i don't see how "search for json" would in any way lead me to the right direction. json is a format for passing data,
[11:41:48] <panfist> but doesn't tell you anything about the pattern of requests/responses to get that data
[11:42:21] <Gangans> ok, my bad, I really didn't understand your problem
[11:42:33] <panfist> for example...can i make one post, and get a response in pieces from the server? would i keep requesting periodically to get progress updates from the server?--but that would result in a lot of requests being made that might be unnecessary overhead
[11:48:03] <snax> moin.
[11:50:48] <panfist> i'm reading about long polling and i think that might apply but it seems like it's not considered a good technique to use? what is a pattern that can be used instead?
[11:56:23] <c4milo> does anybody know why using $.ajax doesn't send an Authorization header even though i'm providing username and password and the server sends the right CORS headers ?

[12:02:17] <simple__> theres a compatibility issue with  $(this).attr("onclick",  for everything but FireFox.   I saw a couple work arounds but none seem to work,  is there a better way than $(this).attr("onclick", "").click(js); ???
[12:08:10] <JaxCodeMonkey> simple__: What are you trying to do with that line?
[12:09:04] <JaxCodeMonkey> simple__: It appears you're trying to fire the onclick attribute that belongs to 'this'. Is that correct?
[12:09:16] <simple__> for each a tag, I was adding an attribute, onClick to run a script that would close thickbox

[12:10:48] <cypha> I'm receiving a JSON array. I'd like to know how to allow jquery.template to use each of the variables passed back

[12:13:25] <selvakumaran> $(this).attr("status")="no"; Dose this will work.?
[12:14:02] <JaxCodeMonkey> cypha: You can use jQuery.parseJSON to turn your array into an object and then access it's properties through yourArray.property.
[12:14:18] <cypha> JaxCodeMonkey, i think it gets returned as an object anyway
[12:15:50] <JaxCodeMonkey> cypja: if it's already a true JSON object, you can access the properties through yourArray.property or yourArray.property.subproperty, ex: alert(myArray.firstProperty);
[12:16:07] <cypha> JaxCodeMonkey, cuz when I print "data" using console.log, I get Object {'username':xyz} or something

[12:30:42] <snax> If I have to download jQuery to develop, does that mean anyone who wants to view web pages written in jQuery need the library installed too?
[12:31:03] <webdev5> snax, no it loads the jquery from your server
[12:31:04] <MrDimn> Snax - no
[12:31:05] <kborchers> snax: wat?
[12:31:42] <snax> webdev5: I thought this is client side programming.  what server is required?
[12:31:49] <webdev5> jquery is javascript
[12:32:05] <snax> I need a web server just to develop the pages?
[12:32:08] <webdev5> your webpage has to link to the jquery library
[12:32:13] <MrDimn> Snax:  You code the pages as you normally do, and include a link to the jQuery library, which will be loaded into the client's browser.
[12:32:13] <snax> oh ok.
[12:33:22] <snax> so when the client makes a request, do they get java script?  In other words web browsers don't konw jQuery directly.  this that correct?
[12:33:39] <snax> s/this/is/
[12:33:41] <MrDimn> Correct.
[12:33:53] <webdev5> yes if the user has javascript enabled then they can view the jquery functionality
[12:34:56] <MrDimn> You have the jQuery library on your web server.  Within your web pages, you make a link to that library.  When the user views your web page, the jQuery library is download, and all the functionality you programmed will be processed by the browser
[12:35:08] <snax> So i'll need an apache plugin to verify what I'm coding.  I can't just open my html files from the browser.
[12:35:34] <MrDimn> No...
[12:36:23] <MrDimn> You should be able to run the web page in your browser, but you may have to put a file path to the jQuery library or call the library which is hosted by jQuery.
[12:36:46] <snax> thanks.

[12:48:40] <JaxCodeMonkey> s34n: You'll need to do some math in JS.
[12:49:32] <jeffsmykil> such as defaults and the like
[12:49:59] <JaxCodeMonkey> jeffsmykil: There are numerous better ways than using global variables. Checkout Cowboy's post about IIFEs. http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/

[12:52:39] <JaxCodeMonkey> jeffsmykil: Not that I'm aware of. I've always just called 'parameter defaults' or something.
[12:53:08] <jeffsmykil> I see
[12:57:18] <jeffsmykil> JaxCodeMonkey:  in the jquery plugin authoring tutorial they use an object.  no good?

[12:58:50] <JaxCodeMonkey> jeffsmykil: You can use an object like they suggest regardless of how you are implementing your defaults, depending on the scope you're trying to achieve. An object is not a bad idea.
[12:58:52] <ponty> dogarrhea2_, just had the same. close the bracket ).
[12:59:16] <JaxCodeMonkey> dogarrhea2_: your htmldiv.append() needs to be $(htmldiv).append().

[13:01:18] <dogarrhea2_> http://pastebin.com/h0H30VHh
[13:01:30] <dogarrhea2_> still wondering why it's a no method 'append'
[13:02:15] <warrenparsons> ponty: It's not a plugin, but http://jsfiddle.net/ might do what you're looking for if you want to experiment with code.
[13:02:24] <dogarrhea2_> oh nevermind
[13:02:52] <ftwordring> How would I go about delegating document.getElementById()?
[13:03:05] <neurodrone> Does anyone know of a way to live-edit javascript in Chrome Devtools or Firebug?
[13:04:09] <warrenparsons> ftwordring: $('.ancestorElement').delegate('click', '#myId', function(){ // blah });
[13:04:31] <dogarrhea2_> Uncaught Error: NOT_FOUND_ERR: DOM Exception 8
[13:04:43] <dogarrhea2_> ugh
[13:04:55] <ftwordring> thx warren, that looks like what I was searching for
[13:04:57] <ponty> neurodrone, i guess we both asked the same question :-)
[13:05:02] <ponty> thx warrenparsons
[13:05:16] <neurodrone> (:
[13:05:22] <phrozen_> hello, why if I send post in first form then I have 2 answers, but at the second form I have 1 alert(1 answer)? http://www.mtechnology.itl.pl/js/
[13:05:45] <dogarrhea2_> mixing jquery and object orientation is annoying
[13:05:49] <dogarrhea2_> u do't know what to add $( to
[13:06:02] <neurodrone> ponty: And you seem to have found the answer already, while I am still looking around for mine.
[13:06:15] <phrozen_> dogarrhea2_ who?
[13:06:49] <m910q> I have made an ajaxSuccess on my page, and it works just fine. But when using Opera, there is nothing called options.data on the options/settings variable. Does this object come from the browser?
[13:06:50] <jeffsmykil> what about an xml config file? bad idea?
[13:07:07] <ponty> neurodrone, no. i ll just try what warren told me: It's not a plugin, but http://jsfiddle.net/ might do what you're looking for if you want to experiment with code.
[13:07:33] <simple__> i'm trying to do a custom submit, using      $('#uc-cart-view-form').submit(function(){$.post($(this).attr('action'), $(this).serialize(), function(html) { }.    This is working, however, my data is which is suppose to be 'items[0][cart_item_id]'=65 is posting as 'items%5B0%5D%5Bqty%5D=1&'   any parameters i can add to stop this??
[13:08:48] <neurodrone> ponty: Oh I see. Well yea, jsfiddle and jsbin fulfill ones needs if they are based on minor testing. I, OTOH, have to debug dependent parts of a big live site. They won't serve my purpose for now.
[13:09:27] <m910q> neurodrone is the javascript inline?
[13:09:38] <neurodrone> m910q: Yes. Inline JS.
[13:09:58] <m910q> You can edit a page in Opera and apply it, and it will reload everything. Just a suggestion
[13:10:08] <ponty> neurodrone, https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firequery/
[13:10:42] <affect> guys, I have a json data object that gets created using selectors (http://pastebin.com/is4np3WG). was there a way to append something to it (e.g. if it was a get request I'd add a +'&foo=bar')? should I use add or push or something?
[13:11:04] <MagusOTB> Is it possible to select things by their data attributes?
[13:11:20] <neurodrone> ponty: Cool! Looks like that might work for me. Taking it for a spin rightaway..
[13:11:36] <neurodrone> m910q: Thanks for the Opera suggestion. Might pick it as a last resort.
[13:11:39] <ponty> neurodrone, me too. lets hope its good
[13:12:48] <phrozen_> http://www.mtechnology.itl.pl/js/ can somebody help me? when I push first "Wyslij" button (which is after NIP field) and I have any data in a form then I have 2 alerts
[13:12:51] <phrozen_> why?
[13:13:26] <ponty> neurodrone, https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firequery/?src=search
[13:19:49] <simple__> how do i send form data with $(form).serialize(); but when i have form items labled "item[0][data]"    it seems to turn the [] to rubbish?
[13:20:27] <jbrokc> how do I use .ajaxStop to check and see if a certain Ajax call has finished, and not fire when the page is done loading?
[13:26:15] <cypha> in jquery.template, I'd like to be able to use ${myvariablefromjson}, which I received from this script returning JSON from the server--> https://gist.github.com/3e253b04d1ebf4bb7cd5
[13:28:07] <snax> To use jquery, I just link my web browser to jquery-1.6.4.js correct?
[13:29:19] <dogarrhea2_> is there an update id cascade thing in jquery?
[13:29:35] <dogarrhea2_> when i update the parent id, all child elements update their id's too?
[13:31:47] <cypha> snax, no
[13:31:52] <Cameron> if you go here and choose $300: http://vermilionsite.com/phone/index.php?id=1
[13:32:09] <Cameron> how can i make that div with the big iphone in have a magnifier?
[13:32:23] <Cameron> like http://jdbartlett.com/loupe/ but with the div rather than images
[13:32:36] <snax> cypha: is jquery-1.6.4.js the library ?
[13:32:49] <cypha> yes, but it needs to point at the location of the file
[13:32:52] <cypha> did you download the file?
[13:33:23] <snax> I wget'ed it.  I have to  point my web browser at it.
[13:35:26] <cypha> snax, you have to point at the local address
[13:36:21] <snax> cypha: I don't know what that means.  Is that a firefox setting, or is that done in index.html ?
[13:36:29] <cypha> index.ht l
[13:36:34] <cypha> index.html
[13:37:03] <snax> include it like I would with any javascript module ?
[13:37:20] <cypha> or you can do something like this
[13:37:22] <cypha> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js"></script>
[13:37:29] <snax> thankx
[13:37:31] <cypha> so it gets it form google
[13:37:31] <ccmonsters> wtf is wrong with this syntax? sorry, my brain is shot so I'm drawing a blank - http://pastie.org/2673209
[13:37:33] <ccmonsters> just xml
[13:37:38] <cypha> of course, use the correct version
[13:37:39] <wib> or get a newer one
[13:39:39] <cypha> in jquery.template, I'd like to be able to use ${myvariablefromjson}, where 'myvariablefromjson' was returned from the server using this script--> https://gist.github.com/3e253b04d1ebf4bb7cd5
[13:39:46] <cypha> how can I do this?
[13:39:57] <cypha> to make the variable avaiable to jquery.template
[13:40:10] <saba> I've got some code (that I unfortunately cannot paste) written for jquery 1.4 that I'm trying to run in jquery 1.6.4, however it fails with error "b.handleError is not a function". This is due to the ajax rewrite that was done in jquery 1.5 I believe. Does anyone know of this error? My .ajax call is very basic, with a success handler and json specified dataType. Then some conflict occurs.
[13:41:18] <cypha> saba, use jquery instead of jquery.min
[13:41:40] <ccmonsters> SO what's up with this xml ? http://pastie.org/2673209
[13:46:26] <shamrock> anyone here with some experience of jquery-ui dialog? $("mydialog").dialog() seems to copying my original element and so there are multiple versions.
[13:49:03] <ccmonsters> what are you tring to do ?
[13:49:11] <ccmonsters> ? demo @ shamrock
[13:49:12] <bot-t> shamrock, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:50:04] <monstaRtruck> anyone used cairo

[14:02:25] <Hopsy> ow
[14:02:28] <Hopsy> use firebug
[14:02:49] <Hopsy> it will help you debugging

[14:04:21] <jimubao>  and i know abt console.log
[14:05:18] <Hopsy> firebug also shows faults in your code
[14:06:41] <jimubao> XD i tend to use chrome more often these day, faster ...
[14:06:50] <cypha> how can I do this? (to make the variable available to jquery.template)
[14:06:52] <jimubao> and with chrome i just use developer tools  ~
[14:07:07] <jimubao> had firebug on ff
[14:07:11] <jimubao> but not on chrome
[14:07:15] <cypha> in jquery.template, I'd like to be able to use ${myvariablefromjson}, where 'myvariablefromjson' was returned from the server using this script--> https://gist.github.com/3e253b04d1ebf4bb7cd5 . So how can I make my returned variables available to jquery.template?

[14:13:06] <Hopsy> Can I get some help?
[14:14:29] <Hopsy> I am using like 10 ajax request, after each succeed ajax request I want to set a delay for like 10 seconds. How can I make this?
[14:15:00] <Hopsy> can i just use .delay ?
[14:15:17] <jeffsmykil> think delay is for animation?
[14:15:19] <jeffsmykil> not sure though
[14:23:19] <b-lew> can i score some jquery help with this home page slider? http://koley.turnpostadmin.com/ the numbers 123 don't seem to be working properly.
[14:26:02] <simple__> how do i send form data with $(form).serialize(); but when i have form items labled "item[0][data]"    it seems to turn the [] to rubbish?

[14:34:03] <simple__> its a form with <item name="item[0][data]" value="23">  its the item name that is not working on serialize

[14:34:44] <ljdawson> Hey everyone, I had the idea to make an animated Google +1 that mimics the style of button seen on any Google search page. I've stuck the source on Github and would love to hear any feedback.
[14:34:58] <ljdawson> Check out the source on Github: https://github.com/laurencedawson/jQuery.googlePlusOne.js
[14:36:49] <fabricius> hi
[14:36:53] <simple__> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/ugXKr/
[14:36:56] <aaronmcadam> why does it show loading indicator ljdawson
[14:37:12] <aaronmcadam> when the animation is complete. my mouse pointer changes
[14:37:36] <aaronmcadam> my god
[14:37:50] <aaronmcadam> simple__: you don't get how fiddles should be done do u lol
[14:38:01] <aaronmcadam> abstract your problem away from your app specific code
[14:38:15] <simple__> sure simplify,
[14:38:27] <aaronmcadam> also would help if u loaded in the right library
[14:38:28] <ljdawson> aaronmcadam: at that point it grabs the plus one js source from google, adds the code to the page activates it
[14:38:44] <aaronmcadam> each time?
[14:38:58] <ljdawson> it only grabs the js source the first time
[14:39:05] <aaronmcadam> surely you should getScript it only once
[14:39:16] <dogarrhea2_> alert($(this).css())  <------ Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[14:39:19] <aaronmcadam> well it's loading every single time the transition finishes
[14:39:27] <dogarrhea2_> $(this).css() doesn't work?
[14:39:32] <ljdawson> its not loading the js source each time
[14:39:53] <aaronmcadam> well it's doing somethin hehe
[14:40:11] <aaronmcadam> dogarrhea2_: you need to pass args to see ?css
[14:40:11] <bot-t> dogarrhea2_, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[14:40:40] <dogarrhea2_> oh. it won't just print everything
[14:40:44] <ljdawson> each time you hover over, it loads an up to date button from google
[14:41:00] <aaronmcadam> hmm can't u preload
[14:41:25] <ljdawson> I could do
[14:41:36] <ljdawson> but the point of the script is to let users chose if they want to enable the button or not, privacy etc
[14:41:36] <aaronmcadam> yeah otherwise it looks alrighty
[14:41:57] <ljdawson> ta
[14:42:01] <aaronmcadam> alright but the loading bit is annoying
[14:42:15] <aaronmcadam> why not just save the image as a sprite
[14:42:30] <ljdawson> which one sorry?
[14:42:55] <aaronmcadam> ah it is a sprite already
[14:43:14] <aaronmcadam> https://ssl.gstatic.com/s2/oz/images/stars/po/Publisher/sprite.png
[14:43:36] <simple__> sorry aaronmcadam , i think i cleaned it up
[14:45:03] <ljdawson> to reduce load time two small image sprites (active and inactive buttons) are saved at the top encoded in base64. This means there is no delay in displaying the +1 button unlike the official google button
[14:45:31] <Hopsy> I want to set a delay in each, how should i do this :\
[14:45:38] <ljdawson> when a user hovers, it grabs the animated sprite, goes through each frame and in the background also loads the official +1 button
[14:46:24] <aaronmcadam> that final step is one you'll have to preload
[14:46:55] <aaronmcadam> could u not load the official button before the animation starts?
[14:47:05] <ljdawson> yes but it goes against the point of the button haha
[14:47:25] <aaronmcadam> which is?
[14:47:48] <ljdawson> privacy!
[14:47:52] <aaronmcadam> hmm?
[14:48:05] <ljdawson> the user should opt in to have +1 enabled
[14:48:12] <aaronmcadam> really?
[14:48:20] <ljdawson> if they hover over the button, they express an interest and the request is made
[14:48:22] <aaronmcadam> whatabout fb like
[14:48:36] <ljdawson> could do the exact same thing with fb like too
[14:49:02] <aaronmcadam> I'm not so sure even a 2kb extra weight is really justified
[14:49:08] <ljdawson> in fact I made this after reading a great post where someone made it so you had to double click on the Facebook like button to enable it
[14:49:12] <aaronmcadam> but nice project for a first plugin
[14:49:25] <ljdawson> most of that 2kb is google sprites
[14:49:30] <aaronmcadam> why? the user doesn't want to double click
[14:49:47] <aaronmcadam> they'll just think ur button is broken
[14:49:56] <aaronmcadam> people are used to clicking once on Like buttons
[14:50:14] <ljdawson> precisely why I chose to load on hover ;)
[14:50:36] <aaronmcadam> hmm seems like ur fixing a non-problem really
[14:51:13] <aaronmcadam> also, why are you passing an "init" string, just calling googlePlusOne should init it
[14:51:35] <aaronmcadam> the only thing that should be there is an options object literal
[14:51:40] <aaronmcadam> if any are needed
[14:51:58] <ljdawson> i'd disagree as there are a plethora of extensions designed to disable all social sharing buttons etc by default
[14:52:14] <aaronmcadam> I don't get the point really
[14:52:14] <ljdawson> at the very least i've made an animated version of the button anyways ^__^
[14:52:28] <aaronmcadam> it's nice don't get me wrong
[14:52:45] <ljdawson> ok ill stick a comparison of speeds vs the default one up
[14:52:47] <ljdawson> 2 ticks
[14:53:04] <ljdawson> also I pass init because later on the callback needs to address on and off methods too
[14:53:53] <aaronmcadam> I'm just talking about plugin conventions
[14:54:07] <aaronmcadam> I can see that
[14:54:17] <ljdawson> actually, i nabbed that code directly from the convention style page
[14:54:25] <aaronmcadam> u could just as easily initialise stuff in an IIFE
[14:55:31] <ljdawson> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Plugin_Methods
[14:55:33] <aaronmcadam> so it's line 59 that's causing the loading
[14:55:57] <aaronmcadam> yeah with options
[14:56:05] <aaronmcadam> $('div').tooltip(); // calls the init method
[14:56:05] <ljdawson> line 60 actually
[14:56:12] <aaronmcadam> see
[14:56:28] <aaronmcadam> get my point?
[14:56:36] <aaronmcadam> init should be called on invocation
[14:56:58] <aaronmcadam> you shouldn't need to call it explicitly, defeats the purpose
[14:57:49] <ljdawson> ok so the difference being I didn't include the else if to detect if the user hasn't included any params thus should execute the init method
[14:57:52] <aaronmcadam> ah, right, you need to query the g plus api, that's the overhead ljdawson?
[14:58:01] <ljdawson> yup
[14:58:24] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to if u just use $.extemd
[14:58:33] <aaronmcadam> s/extemd/extend
[14:58:43] <aaronmcadam> u can call the init regardless then
[14:58:55] <ljdawson> fancy pulling on git?
[14:59:51] <aaronmcadam> ah this is my games machine I could just make a quick pastie instead
[15:00:25] <aaronmcadam> don't have git set up
[15:00:37] <ljdawson> sure
[15:00:59] <aaronmcadam> anyway can't think of anywhere you'd want options being set right now
[15:01:41] <aaronmcadam> see if this works one sec
[15:03:21] <hi88is> Howdy everyone - syntax question. What's the proper way to write: $('#navigation_dev').animate(height:100);
[15:04:28] <aaronmcadam> ljdawson: http://pastie.org/2673745
[15:04:49] <aaronmcadam> hi88is: wrap your opts in {}
[15:06:13] <aaronmcadam> ljdawson: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[15:06:37] <ljdawson> aha
[15:06:51] <ljdawson> did you try it out?
[15:07:01] <aaronmcadam> nope, as I said this isn't my dev machine
[15:07:06] <ljdawson> :P
[15:07:11] <ljdawson> ill give it a shot now
[15:07:15] <hi88is> Thanks Aaron
[15:07:17] <hi88is> ;)
[15:07:20] <aaronmcadam> did it work?
[15:07:45] <ljdawson> just branching and pushing a demo
[15:09:54] <ljdawson> ok so this is without the plugin, watch how long the plus ones take to init
[15:09:54] <ljdawson> http://laurencedawson.github.com/jQuery.googlePlusOne.js/regular.html
[15:10:03] <ljdawson> this is with the plugin: http://laurencedawson.github.com/jQuery.googlePlusOne.js/plugin.html
[15:10:20] <mrbig1> How do you know when the jQuery source file has been loaded?
[15:11:19] <aaronmcadam> mrbig1: have u got firebug open?
[15:12:04] <hi88is> aarron: yup - that was correct syntax
[15:12:32] <aaronmcadam> good good hi88is
[15:12:39] <mrbig1> aaronmcadam: I'm worried that $(document).ready .... or whatever it is will throw an error about $ not being defined because the jQuery source file hasnt been loaded yet.
[15:12:41] <hi88is> Cheers
[15:12:42] <hi88is> ;)
[15:12:42] <aaronmcadam> mrbig1: type in $.fn
[15:12:52] <mrbig1> I'm sure typing in $ would work too.
[15:12:56] <aaronmcadam> uhm mrbig1  think ur confused
[15:13:04] <mrbig1> I may be, that's hy I asked.
[15:13:19] <aaronmcadam> document.ready will only fire once the dom has loaded so...
[15:13:37] <mrbig1> you mean only when the source files have all been loaded?
[15:13:44] <aaronmcadam> well yeah
[15:14:11] <aaronmcadam> how are u including jquery
[15:14:18] <mrbig1> aaronmcadam: when does $(document).ready... get executed? when does that get called to attach the function to the ready event?
[15:14:27] <ColKurtz> when the DOM has loaded
[15:14:27] <mrbig1> with a <scriptt>
[15:14:33] <aaronmcadam> yes but where
[15:14:38] <mrbig1> in the head, i think
[15:14:42] <mrbig1> maybe in the body
[15:14:42] <aaronmcadam> in your head or before closing body tag
[15:14:55] <mrbig1> What's the difference?
[15:15:24] <aaronmcadam> scripts called at the end of your closing body tag is essentially the same thing as ready as the browser will have loaded everything by then
[15:15:43] <mrbig1> are you sur ethat's always true?
[15:15:47] <aaronmcadam> short answer, no need to worry about it mrbig1
[15:15:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah haha
[15:16:06] <mrbig1> So you mean right before the </dbody> tag?
[15:16:14] <aaronmcadam> it won't matter
[15:16:20] <mrbig1> what wont matter?
[15:16:28] <mrbig1> I have reports of $ not defined errors.
[15:16:33] <aaronmcadam> if u include jquery in ur head for example., and then include script tags after that with ur doc.ready, it will always work
[15:16:45] <mrbig1> I'm not doing the latter.
[15:17:03] <aaronmcadam> you need to include script tags after jquery if ur loading in the head
[15:17:03] <ljdawson> aaronmcadam, I implemented your changes, throwing an uncaught type error
[15:17:08] <mrbig1> I believe I am writing out script tags in the head and in the body.
[15:17:09] <aaronmcadam> wohoo :D
[15:17:17] <aaronmcadam> obviously it's loading too quickly
[15:17:30] <HI_bankzy> Is it possible to get the text from a textarea on either blur or onfocusout
[15:17:36] <aaronmcadam> you'll probably need to put some checks in
[15:17:42] <mrbig1> me?
[15:17:51] <aaronmcadam> or just call it like u were going to ljdawson
[15:18:00] <aaronmcadam> no mrbig1, see ?p
[15:18:00] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:18:10] <ljdawson> ill implement your css changes but keep the old method for now
[15:18:12] <mrbig1> ?p ?
[15:18:12] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:18:15] <aaronmcadam> yeah cool
[15:18:23] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ mrbig1
[15:18:23] <bot-t> mrbig1, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:18:49] <mrbig1> aaronmcadam: what if jQuery hasn't loaded by the time the browser tries to execute the $(document).ready... code?
[15:19:04] <aaronmcadam> that's not how browsers work
[15:19:05] <mrbig1> Is that possible?
[15:19:08] <aaronmcadam> scripts are a blocking action
[15:19:10] <mrbig1> It's not?
[15:19:12] <mrbig1> ah
[15:19:17] <aaronmcadam> yes external scripts are
[15:19:22] <mrbig1> and only 1 is loaded at a time?
[15:19:25] <mrbig1> ok thanks
[15:19:29] <aaronmcadam> so it won't get to ur ready block until jquery has loaded
[15:19:30] <snover> ?101 @ mrbig1
[15:19:30] <bot-t> mrbig1, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[15:19:31] <aaronmcadam> no
[15:19:53] <mrbig1> no, not that new. I havent come across this $ undefined problem before, though
[15:19:55] <aaronmcadam> try not to worry about it too much just yet
[15:20:00] <aaronmcadam> ah right cool
[15:20:02] <mrbig1> This is a higher latency connection.
[15:20:08] <mrbig1> over a
[15:20:31] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:20:46] <aaronmcadam> basically it will work stop stressing :P
[15:20:58] <aaronmcadam> if ur *really* worried, use this
[15:21:41] <aaronmcadam> mrbig1: https://gist.github.com/403097
[15:21:52] <HI_bankzy> ____ Anyone know of a possible solution, that when you click off an input field it gets the text that was inserted? focusout and blur doesn't work as it returns undefined.
[15:22:23] <aaronmcadam> what does event.target give u
[15:22:30] <mrbig1> thanks aaronmcadam
[15:22:33] <aaronmcadam> np
[15:22:44] <aaronmcadam> document.write is a definate blocking action
[15:22:57] <aaronmcadam> so that will make damn sure jquery is included mrbig1
[15:23:22] <mrbig1> heh ok, now i have something that sets a timeout and waits for $ to be defined.
[15:23:26] <aaronmcadam> if u really need to worry about latency, you should use a cdn
[15:23:36] <mrbig1> yeah, we have those here :)
[15:23:43] <aaronmcadam> ur doing something wrong dude if u need to do that
[15:23:55] <aaronmcadam> what cdn are u using?
[15:24:12] <mrbig1> I don't know what we're actually using.
[15:24:15] <aaronmcadam> cdn-js, they use cloudflare, really brilliant speeds
[15:24:23] <aaronmcadam> dns lookups are mad fast
[15:24:36] <aaronmcadam> and it's location based too
[15:25:11] <aaronmcadam> mrbig1: paste the code ur using to include jquery
[15:25:17] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ mrbig1
[15:25:17] <bot-t> mrbig1, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:25:47] <mrbig1> noooo :P
[15:25:56] <aaronmcadam> mrbig1: also try this link for including jquery http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js
[15:26:05] <aaronmcadam> I can't help u if u don't show me what ur doing wrong
[15:26:13] <mrbig1> We cannot use outside links like that, from what I hear
[15:26:22] <mrbig1> You have laready hleped, thanks :)
[15:26:24] <aaronmcadam> are u using rackspace?
[15:26:27] <mrbig1> nope
[15:26:35] <aaronmcadam> your own cdn?
[15:26:39] <mrbig1> Maybe
[15:26:44] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:26:52] <aaronmcadam> well something is definately wrong with ur load balancer
[15:26:55] <mrbig1> I think we just serve it up normally, though
[15:27:11] <aaronmcadam> how many requests u getting?
[15:27:25] <aaronmcadam> you seriously shouldn't be setting timeouts to check if jQuery is defined
[15:27:40] <mrbig1> yeah
[15:28:01] <aaronmcadam> and unless u show me an *abstracted* example of how ur trying to include jquery i can't help u
[15:28:44] <aaronmcadam> also, check this site too see ?ftjq

[15:29:28] <mrbig1> thanks
[15:29:55] <aaronmcadam> sounds like it's something else that's wrong tho
[15:33:15] <AphelionZ> Does anybody have any experience using jquery templats on the server AND client at the same time?
[15:34:25] <aaronmcadam> what do u mean?
[15:34:30] <coldhead> good grief
[15:34:33] <aaronmcadam> at the same time?
[15:34:36] <coldhead> long shift aaronmcadam?
[15:34:43] <aaronmcadam> na
[15:34:56] <coldhead> IT'S BEEN 14 HOURS MAN
[15:35:06] <aaronmcadam> weren't many decent questions earlier
[15:35:20] <coldhead> neverthless, i still think a coin should be struck in your honour
[15:35:27] <aaronmcadam> I don't be completely active all day, just have irc open at work
[15:35:30] <coldhead> the aaronmcadam commemorative nickel
[15:35:40] <AphelionZ> ok so I'm using node.js (and I asked in node.js and nobody knew) and https://github.com/kof/node-jqtpl which is a port of jquery templates for the server... basically it renders in and does all the templating stuff on the server side
[15:35:42] <coldhead> not legal tender
[15:35:53] <aaronmcadam> pissh american money
[15:36:01] <aaronmcadam> not worth much anyway even if it was legal :p
[15:36:02] <AphelionZ> however... if i try to include a script on the client side, it barfs because the server overwrites things like ${username} adn they dont get rendered
[15:36:09] <hi88is> haha
[15:36:13] <aaronmcadam> ah was gonna ask were u on node
[15:36:14] <hi88is> right on aaron!
[15:36:33] <hi88is> american dollars = monopoly money
[15:36:35] <hi88is> hehe
[15:36:38] <aaronmcadam> AphelionZ: have u tried jsdom?
[15:37:00] <meinmkv> euro is doing fantastic too, eh?
[15:37:04] <aaronmcadam> AphelionZ: have u tried jade?
[15:37:04] <hi88is> Aarron: can you tell me why this function doesn't work for the line 18 function?
[15:37:06] <hi88is> http://pastebin.com/fLHtYPvG
[15:37:36] <hi88is> aaron: is it because the a.down class is added after the DOM has been loaded?
[15:37:37] <aaronmcadam> don't use that
[15:37:40] <aaronmcadam> please fiddle
[15:37:40] <AphelionZ> im not sure what jsdom is but i dont like things like jade for a couple reasons
[15:37:44] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ hi88is

[15:39:57] <hi88is> yea - i'm on it right now brotha
[15:39:59] <hi88is> :)
[15:39:59] <AphelionZ> Well, I like jquery templates because i'm still using html instead of a yaml based engine, and i guess that's just be being a purist/stubborn or whatever
[15:40:00] <AphelionZ> however,
[15:40:09] <aaronmcadam> purist?
[15:40:12] <aaronmcadam> really? haha
[15:40:28] <snover> I don’t think most people use or ever will use yaml
[15:40:31] <aaronmcadam> you use the best tool for the job... but yeah go on
[15:40:44] <aaronmcadam> rails i thought uses it
[15:40:51] <AphelionZ> i learned a lot about what i do through "view source" and the compiling engines minimize at compile time and i feel like i'm sorta robbing people of that
[15:41:05] <aaronmcadam> hahah!
[15:41:23] <AphelionZ> hey, you asked
[15:41:39] <aaronmcadam> altruism is effecting ur tool choice, nice lol
[15:42:00] <aaronmcadam> can u "view source" on a rails project?
[15:42:09] <AphelionZ> whatever man
[15:42:10] <aaronmcadam> there's a reason they minimise
[15:42:53] <aaronmcadam> so right, what happens when u pass the vars in the context AphelionZ
[15:43:01] <snover> AphelionZ: what incredible and amazing things are you doing in your code that is so useful and unique to people that they will want to learn from it?
[15:43:08] <aaronmcadam> ooo :D
[15:43:13] <hi88is> aaronmcadam: here it is - my first ever fiddle :D
[15:43:15] <hi88is> http://jsfiddle.net/4W3Xe/
[15:43:21] <aaronmcadam> *holds breath*
[15:43:22] <AphelionZ> that's a wild assumption to make from what im saying
[15:43:36] <aaronmcadam> it's pretty silly tho dude hah
[15:43:42] <hi88is> doesn't even work on the first click but it works in a browser
[15:43:45] <hi88is> :P
[15:43:49] <aaronmcadam> first mistake
[15:43:56] <aaronmcadam> look on the left side of the window
[15:44:03] <aaronmcadam> are you using Mootools?
[15:44:06] <aaronmcadam> i think not :p
[15:44:11] <hi88is> ahhhh
[15:44:15] <hi88is> thx ;)
[15:44:24] <aaronmcadam> change it to onDOMReady too
[15:45:11] <JohnnyDavidson> How would I convert a base64 image to an image?
[15:45:11] <hi88is> Updated
[15:45:19] <hi88is> thx for the quick lesson ;P
[15:45:30] <JohnnyDavidson> Like the library I have generates images with really long URL's
[15:45:34] <aaronmcadam> so right, I sit down and tell my manager that I don't want to use a tool that's proven to be awesome because it won't allow people to view source, even tho js-beautify is awesome :D
[15:45:48] <aaronmcadam> new link plz hi88is
[15:46:10] <aaronmcadam> JohnnyDavidson: the data-uri prop of css
[15:46:23] <aaronmcadam> not sure about browser support tho
[15:46:23] <AphelionZ> haha you're really hung up on this arent you
[15:46:28] <hi88is> cool - now it's showing what i'm seeing in my browser. clicking menu pulls it up - but clicking down doesn't work - i'm wondering if it is because you can't change a class and create a function after the DOM is loaded
[15:46:30] <aaronmcadam> it's just silly
[15:46:33] <hi88is> http://jsfiddle.net/4W3Xe/2/
[15:46:54] <JohnnyDavidson> aaronmcadam how do I convert it to an actual image
[15:47:05] <aaronmcadam> try it on img src
[15:47:15] <aaronmcadam> ="data-uri(...)" something similar
[15:47:32] <JohnnyDavidson> yeah I know
[15:47:42] <JohnnyDavidson> I'm trying to make it generate an actual image though'
[15:47:43] <aaronmcadam> hmm i can't see anything hi88is
[15:47:49] <JohnnyDavidson> Like a png file or something
[15:48:35] <hi88is> aaron: see how i'm changing the class of the anchor from up to down and then trying to create a function that looks for a click on the down class?
[15:48:51] <aaronmcadam> just a min, i can't even see ur nav bar
[15:49:00] <JohnnyDavidson> Is it possible?
[15:49:02] <hi88is> oh - odd
[15:50:03] <aaronmcadam> hmmm
[15:50:20] <aaronmcadam> wtf
[15:50:32] <aaronmcadam> ah
[15:50:36] <aaronmcadam> ur css was fuckin it up
[15:51:35] <aaronmcadam> hi88is: u don't need to do that
[15:52:21] <aaronmcadam> hi88is: http://jsfiddle.net/4W3Xe/5/
[15:52:26] <hi88is> i'm trying slidetoggle now
[15:52:32] <hi88is> let me check how you approached :D
[15:52:33] <aaronmcadam> wait a minute
[15:52:36] <hi88is> thx
[15:52:37] <hi88is> k
[15:52:41] <aaronmcadam> u need to preventDefault on the click too
[15:52:47] <aaronmcadam> otherwise the link will eventually load
[15:52:56] <aaronmcadam> which is not what u want
[15:53:30] <aaronmcadam> hi88is: http://jsfiddle.net/4W3Xe/6/
[15:53:36] <hi88is> k - checkin
[15:54:03] <aaronmcadam> you *could* try a toggle if u wanted
[15:54:21] <aaronmcadam> but u obviously want to remove the class first and then add another so it shouldn't matter
[15:54:33] <hi88is> ah
[15:54:36] <hi88is> hummm
[15:54:55] <aaronmcadam> don't replace the whole element
[15:54:55] <hi88is> seems like your example doesn't work on the second click as well for me
[15:54:59] <hi88is> does it work for you?
[15:55:02] <aaronmcadam> that's just crazy talk
[15:55:07] <aaronmcadam> no, ur css is whacked on mine
[15:55:24] <hi88is> haha - my father in-law says "that's just crazy talk" all the time
[15:55:29] <hi88is> are you him incognito?
[15:55:30] <hi88is> :P
[15:55:34] <aaronmcadam> hope not
[15:55:46] <aaronmcadam> unless ur half irish?
[15:55:53] <aaronmcadam> cuz i'm 100% irish beef
[15:56:16] <aaronmcadam> right, u wanna slide the div up and down right
[15:56:49] <aaronmcadam> hi88is: http://jsfiddle.net/4W3Xe/7/
[15:57:26] <aaronmcadam> slideToggle or just slideUp/Down will do fine
[15:57:49] <aaronmcadam> just wish ur css was more complete so i could see
[15:58:00] <hi88is> hummm - both your lastest postings aren't working some I'm trying to mess with them and get em to work
[15:58:12] <hi88is> not sure what in the css is making it so you can't see
[15:58:21] <aaronmcadam> they aren't displaying at all on mine in the Result
[15:58:38] <aaronmcadam> because of position:fixed in ur #navigation_dev
[15:58:46] <hi88is> yea, let me mess with it a bit
[15:59:00] <aaronmcadam> u can link to external css u know

[16:12:35] <aaronmcadam> night night coldhead xxx
[16:12:35] <hi88is> thx
[16:13:08] <coldhead> what a rude man
[16:13:57] <Hopsy> hey coldhead
[16:14:20] <coldhead> hello you!
[16:14:24] <coldhead> long time no
[16:14:28] <Zxurian> is there a way to detect whether an image is being loaded from cache vs downloaded?
[16:15:17] <Hopsy> Verily!
[16:16:09] <new2net> is there a json_encode() function for jquery?
[16:16:21] <ajpiano> ?stringify
[16:16:21] <bot-t> JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[16:20:00] <coldhead> are you well Hopsy ?
[16:20:43] <Hopsy> yes I am thanks and u?
[16:21:53] <coldhead> i am okay -_-
[16:22:45] <Hopsy> hmm oke
[16:23:27] <Hopsy> was that ironic?
[16:23:37] <coldhead> no, just subdued
[16:25:31] <Hopsy> hmm, you can tell me everything, you know that!
[16:29:23] <new2net> ajpiano: can you show me an example using json2?
[16:29:52] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = {abc: "def"};  JSON.stringify( foo );
[16:29:52] <bot-t> ajpiano: "{\"abc\":\"def\"}"
[16:30:43] <new2net> oh wow. Glad I asked, i was way over complicating it. Thanks again
[16:31:00] <ajpiano> :)
[16:38:16] <Zxurian> is anyone familiar with https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded ?
[16:40:13] <shamrock> how can I select an unchecked checkbox? :checked exists but not unchecked.
[16:42:19] <ajpiano> :not(:checked)
[16:43:18] <eddiemonge> no #jot for me :(
[16:45:13] <supertrue> can someone tell me why this doesn't capture <p>bla bla</p>?:  str.replace( "<p>(.*)</p>", "$1" );
[16:46:14] <eddiemonge> supertrue: because you need to do a regex search and not a normal search
[16:47:15] <supertrue> how would I do a regex search? I thought the page I looked at said .replace() does both?
[16:47:30] <eddiemonge> supertrue: it does, if you pass in a regex option.
[16:47:38] <eddiemonge> ?mdn regex @ supertrue
[16:47:39] <bot-t> supertrue, jQuery :regex filter - Waldek Mastykarz - http://blog.mastykarz.nl/jquery-regex-filter/
[16:49:02] <eddiemonge> supertrue: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[16:53:21] <ColKurtz> ?broadrod
[16:53:22] <bot-t> ColKurtz, Couldn't find "broadrod" in jQuery Docs.
[16:59:42] <Kamakazi> is there a way to check if a string is a valid json formatted text?
[17:00:08] <supertrue> eddiemonge: I've been looking at the mozilla replace() link and I don't fully understand what I'm doing wrong -- str.replace( /<p>(.*)</p>/ , "$1" ); gives a parse error because (I suppose because it lacks quotes around the first argument) and  str.replace( '/<p>(.*)</p>/ , "$1" );
[17:00:24] <eddiemonge> Kamakazi: where is the string coming from?
[17:00:47] <supertrue> * and  str.replace( '/<p>(.*)</p>/', "$1" ); doesn't match anything;
[17:00:48] <Kamakazi> eddiemonge: an ajax call
[17:02:26] <eddiemonge> supertrue: str.replace(/<p>(.*)<\/p>/, "$1")
[17:02:35] <eddiemonge> Kamakazi: and you are using jquery?
[17:03:01] <Kamakazi> eddiemonge: Yes
[17:03:35] <eddiemonge> Kamakazi: if you specific datatype json and it succeeds then it should be good
[17:07:55] <dilby> $(this).closest('#anal_sex_delete');   <===== why doesnt this  work?
[17:08:54] <eddiemonge> dilby: really? you could just do $('#ele') since ids should be unique
[17:09:36] <snover> dilby: you can’t delete anal sex.
[17:09:37] <melvinram> People familiar with the Ext JS license… I have a question about it… http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/license/ am I reading this page correctly in that if I use Ext JS 4 for a commercial project, I can keep the license to be whatever I want and if I choose, I can open source the app as long as I license with GPL v3?
[17:09:52] <snover> melvinram: I am not sure why you think jquery is related to extjs but I can assure you it is not.
[17:10:10] <dilby> screw ext js its so annoying
[17:10:15] <dilby> and sencha touch is vaporware
[17:10:29] <melvinram> snover: doesn't ext js build on query? that's why I assumed this might be a good place to ask
[17:10:34] <melvinram> *jquery
[17:11:09] <snover> I have no idea where you got that impression
[17:11:12] <snover> because it is patently false
[17:11:20] <eddiemonge> melvinram: basically if you use sencha without paying for the license you have to provide the source for anything you create that your code touches, front-end and back-end
[17:11:46] <dgathright> melvinram: ext js used to use YUI.  Never used jQuery (as far as I know)
[17:11:47] <eddiemonge> melvinram: not even close. extJS has a jquery adapter that they write in spite of jquery
[17:13:11] <melvinram> snover: I got that impression because I was in here a couple weeks ago asking about good jquery grids and someone pointed me to it and said it was really good but something about the licensing causing bad blood with jquery people… or that's what  I remembered.
[17:13:24] <melvinram> eddiemonge: okay thanks.
[17:14:37] <eddiemonge> melvinram: probably i said that
[17:14:52] <eddiemonge> i never said it was built on jquery though
[17:15:09] <melvinram> eddiemonge: my mistake.
[17:15:09] <Iarfen> Hi
[17:15:23] <Iarfen> How I can select the $i element in a set of elements?
[17:15:30] <objNoob> how do you prevent margin collapsing?
[17:15:43] <eddiemonge> Larrifax: the $i element? what is i?
[17:15:46] <dgathright> melvinram: There is a lot of speculation over what GPL'd JS can and can't do.  Some say that by including GPL JS in your page that the entire app/page needs to be GPL-compliant as well (the equivalent of compiling something in).  I don't necessarily agree with that, but it is uncharted territory.  There's a reason most JS libraries are BSD or MIT
[17:15:47] <new2net> ajpiano: is there any way to save the output of JSON.stringify( foo ); to the value of a hidden form element?
[17:15:52] <eddiemonge> objNoob: you mean border collapsing?
[17:16:07] <objNoob> no eddiemonge, margin collapsing
[17:16:34] <eddiemonge> new2net: $('hiddenelement').val( JSON.stringify( foo )
[17:16:41] <eddiemonge> objNoob: what is that?
[17:17:38] <melvinram> dgathright: gotcha. I just want something that works well and looking at a ton of different grid options, theirs seems the best spreadsheet like editing functionality. But I do want to use the same knowledge in an open source app that I'm building… so I don't want to relearn something twice.
[17:18:10] <eddiemonge> melvinram: did you look at dojo?
[17:18:29] <melvinram> eddiemonge: honestly… not really since I don't know it.
[17:18:31] <objNoob> eddiemonge: if you have 2 divs set margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px
[17:18:50] <objNoob> eddiemonge: there will only be 5px between the 2 divs
[17:19:21] <objNoob> eddiemonge: you would think it the space between should be 10px
[17:19:38] <objNoob> but its not
[17:19:42] <objNoob> the margins collapsed
[17:20:08] <objNoob> its stupid
[17:20:16] <snover> welcome to css
[17:20:49] <objNoob> thanks, take me home ;[
[17:21:03] <snover> there are some properties in webkit that can be use to disallow margin collapsing, not sure if they are draft standards or proprietary or what
[17:21:04] <snover> but they exist
[17:21:11] <snover> which is a thing
[17:21:19] <ericlewis> is there a way to handle any .keypress() instead of binding it to a specific element?
[17:21:36] <objNoob> document?
[17:21:39] <objNoob> window?
[17:21:50] <objNoob> $(window).keypress()
[17:21:52] <eddiemonge> objNoob: margins technically specify the distance between the elements, not between the margins of those elements
[17:22:13] <ericlewis> ah :)
[17:22:16] <ericlewis> i was trying body
[17:22:29] <eddiemonge> ericlewis: how? $('body') ?
[17:22:43] <ericlewis> yeah
[17:23:00] <eddiemonge> thatshould work
[17:23:07] <ericlewis> didn't work
[17:23:08] <ericlewis>  but $(window).keypress works fine
[17:24:10] <objNoob> eddiemonge .. if I set a margin bottom  of a div...   and margin top of another div directly after
[17:24:14] <melvinram> eddiemonge: also my existing app already uses jQuery pretty extensively and I didn't think it made sense to load 2 libraries
[17:24:27] <objNoob> eddiemonge, the margin should be bottom+top
[17:25:30] <eddiemonge> objNoob: have you read http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins
[17:25:48] <eddiemonge> melvinram: then you are going to have to use jqgrid or wait for jqui's grid to be done
[17:26:05] <objNoob> if you took 2 pieces of lined paper, each having a top margin. spun one piece 180% and taped the piece together at the edges
[17:26:33] <objNoob> You've doubled the margin space.
[17:27:48] <eddiemonge> objNoob: but that is a different scenario
[17:28:29] <objNoob> It's only logical!
[17:28:55] <objNoob> Do table borders collapse naturally?
[17:28:57] <new2net> eddiemonge, it works!  [INDEX_0] => {"F":"88","S":"86","R":"87"}
[17:31:03] <eddiemonge> new2net: um congrats? although i dont know what i did
[17:31:45] <new2net> oh... i was having trouble saving the json string to the value of a hidden element. That's what the string looks like after dumping $_POST in php (it worked).
[17:33:22] <eddiemonge> new2net: you probably want to serialize it, not jsonify it
[17:34:01] <new2net> eddiemonge: yes, serialize makes more sense. Actually, I'm not sure what the difference is in the case of JSON. I just thought JSON was a universal standard for serializing data.
[17:37:04] <eddiemonge> new2net: sort of. serialize for post usually means formatting the string like str=hello+world&num=3&sort=asc
[17:38:04] <new2net> that looks more like the get method. Are you sure you meant post?
[17:40:11] <eddiemonge> its similiar. have you looked at see ? serialize
[17:40:12] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[17:43:53] <Remy> hi
[17:44:03] <eddiemonge> hello
[17:49:32] <AlainJacomet> Can someone think of a reason why this isn't working? jQuery('#searchform').closest('.header-right').remove();
[17:52:14] <abjorn> meh @ dart
[17:53:48] <joikus> hi
[17:53:53] <joikus> you guys,
[17:53:56] <abjorn> hi
[17:54:16] <joikus> I need a nice lightbox that allows me to dump html from the server via ajax into the light box, after I clicked on a link to open it.
[17:56:25] <joikus> http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/  ?
[17:56:28] <abstrusenick> any good jquery touch plugin for desktop?
[18:12:17] <cypha> can someone tell me what "return false;" is doing in this script https://gist.github.com/ab19cea9d2d0c81590a6
[18:19:53] <Dave_Stein> cypha: hey i got a good link for you if i can dig it up
[18:20:29] <Dave_Stein> cypha: this one actually is good since resig answered, even if it's not what i was thinking of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1357118/javascript-event-preventdefault-vs-return-false
[18:20:57] <Dave_Stein> cypha: so that will stop the native form submission and prevent any other handlers from hitting it via bubble
[18:21:12] <cypha> aah, ok, cool, I didn't know you could do it like that
[18:21:16] <cypha> thanks Dave_Stein :)
[18:21:52] <cypha> Dave_Stein, who's Resig anyway?
[18:21:55] <Dave_Stein> cypha: np. It's best not to use return false.
[18:22:01] <Dave_Stein> cypha: John Resig is the creator of jQuery :)
[18:22:26] <cypha> ah, ok
[18:22:31] <cypha> which one of these guys in here is him?
[18:23:02] <Dave_Stein> cypha: he logs on as his own name if he's around
[18:23:11] <cypha> oh ok
[18:23:18] <Dave_Stein> cypha: but i've never seen him answer stuff. there's enough help in here usually
[18:23:27] <cypha> that's true
[18:25:03] <cypha> Dave_Stein, so why're u saying return false is worse?
[18:25:33] <Dave_Stein> cypha: yes because it can unintentionally screw someone else later, not realizing the bubble was stopped
[18:25:50] <cypha> oh i see, for readability
[18:25:58] <cypha> fair enough
[18:26:17] <cypha> i technically don't need it though, I don't even have an action= on my form
[18:28:03] <Dave_Stein> cypha: all my old forms that are supposed to be ajax only I just do action='#' and then in the HTML I always do onsubmit="return false;" in case there's a JS error of sorts
[18:28:19] <Dave_Stein> cypha: i have a form builder so i never forget that onsubmit thing. buttt i'd imagine your form is AJAX posting somewhere?
[18:28:50] <Dave_Stein> cypha: it's better to use your server side language to put the action on the form and then do something like $.post( form.attr( 'action' ), {} )
[18:29:25] <cypha> $.post('authenticate', {login:login, password:password},
[18:30:00] <Dave_Stein> i prefer not to write any URLs into the JS
[18:30:16] <Dave_Stein> updating PHP file and clearing APC is better than having to nuke my cdn file
[18:30:47] <cypha> i have to have a url though in the post, no?
[18:30:54] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[18:31:21] <imsky> Dave_Stein: who didn't know who jeresig was
[18:31:26] <Dave_Stein> my public URLs are all constants in case I need to change them in future
[18:31:28] <Dave_Stein> ^
[18:31:30] <Dave_Stein> :)
[18:31:51] <Dave_Stein> like URL_AUTHENTICA = '/authenticate'
[18:31:59] <Dave_Stein> minus that weird typo
[18:32:06] <cypha> oh, i gotcha
[18:32:12] <Dave_Stein> but then my form gets action="<?=URL_AUTHENTICATE;?>"
[18:32:23] <Dave_Stein> so in the JS i just point to the attribute which can change forever and the JS file won't break
[18:32:51] <Dave_Stein> imsky: i think it's funny but i'm not sure how long it took for me to find out who john resig was either, in cypha's defense
[18:33:09] <Dave_Stein> imsky: man you catch twitter fast for someone who never tweets ha
[18:33:29] <abjorn> imskys here?
[18:33:30] <abjorn> IMSKYYY
[18:33:30] <imsky> Dave_Stein: aw yeah
[18:33:33] <imsky> oh baby
[18:33:35] <imsky> it's you
[18:33:40] <abjorn> you see Dart?
[18:33:43] <imsky> yes sir
[18:33:45] <cypha> it's on twitter?
[18:33:51] <abjorn> im not very impressed
[18:33:56] <imsky> my first thought: how do i plug jabokweries into here
[18:34:02] <imsky> then i saw they had a DOM api
[18:34:02] <abjorn> rofl
[18:34:02] <cypha> oh, Dave_Stein just tweeted that
[18:34:06] <imsky> and i was like yeeeeaaa fuck this
[18:34:07] <cypha> jerk
[18:34:12] <abjorn> inb4 jquery ported to dart
[18:34:14] <abjorn> dquery?
[18:34:18] <imsky> abjorn: you know it will be
[18:34:22] <abjorn> course
[18:34:22] <imsky> it looks cool tho
[18:34:25] <abjorn> meh
[18:34:34] <imsky> kinda like "coffeescript: the java version"
[18:34:38] <cypha> if I have $('#loginform').submit(function() {....where would I put .preventDefault?
[18:34:42] <abjorn> I don't like interfaces unless you're like Go and there are no classes
[18:34:45] <Dave_Stein> cypha: i didn't call your name out so I'm not a jerk ha
[18:34:47] <abjorn> they're uncessary fluff
[18:34:50] <abjorn> *unnecessary
[18:34:52] <cypha> in the example in Dave_Stein's link, it had e.preventDefault
[18:34:53] <Dave_Stein> cypha: i usually put it at the end
[18:34:57] <cypha> but I don't have an argument in my function
[18:34:59] <imsky> abjorn: when i program in jabo, they are pretty useful
[18:35:01] <Dave_Stein> oh oh
[18:35:02] <imsky> but that's rare
[18:35:04] <Dave_Stein> function( e )
[18:35:09] <imsky> dart is pretty obviously for jabo/blub coders
[18:35:09] <abjorn> interfaces?
[18:35:12] <imsky> yeah
[18:35:15] <Dave_Stein> function ( bananas ) would make it bananas.preventDefault
[18:35:22] <cypha> so I need to have function(e)?
[18:35:33] <imsky> prevent default bananas
[18:35:33] <abjorn> an interface is a class without the implementation. You can write a class that does the same damn thing
[18:35:37] <imsky> need that on a tshirt somewhere
[18:35:40] <abjorn> virtual classes are the same thing in C++
[18:35:45] <abjorn> no need for interfaces
[18:35:53] <imsky> abjorn: bro. this is compiled to js in browser, and helps with maintenance
[18:36:02] <abjorn> mehh
[18:36:11] <imsky> lol i did catch you trolling the oatmeal though
[18:36:13] <Dave_Stein> cypha: you should read the docs some more... the first argument passed to any event callback is the event
[18:36:17] <abjorn> I *do* like the erlang-style concurrency though
[18:36:19] <abjorn> lol imsky
[18:36:22] <Dave_Stein> cypha: and if you're confused about the e/event thing you need to read about JS more
[18:36:23] <abjorn> on G+?
[18:36:25] <imsky> yeah
[18:36:31] <abjorn> he got mad and blocked me from his page
[18:36:34] <imsky> yeah i saw
[18:36:38] <abjorn> I lol'd
[18:36:41] <abjorn> I still read his comic so w/e
[18:36:51] <imsky> i dunno why you were so harsh on SJ
[18:36:53] <abjorn> to be fair, I went a liiittle far
[18:36:58] <imsky> unless of course it was to trolle
[18:37:01] <abjorn> in reality im not that harsh on him
[18:37:08] <cypha> I need a js mentor...anyone feeling myagi'ish?
[18:37:10] <abjorn> I was just sooo sick and tired of all the ass kissing
[18:37:16] <abjorn> coldhead is, cypha
[18:37:18] <imsky> you know i thought about it
[18:37:21] <abjorn> brb gonna play a LoL match
[18:37:26] <imsky> he's probably more ruthless than gates was
[18:37:54] <cypha> haha, he's helped me before
[18:37:57] <Dave_Stein> imsky: you should make a way for your cssfx to be run from server. *insert i dont know what im talking about really* kinda like coffeescript... since doing a simple js implementation will cause the effects to flicker in once JS runs
[18:38:16] <abjorn> yeah probably
[18:38:22] <imsky> Dave_Stein: there are php libs for that. FOUC will be addressed at some point
[18:38:47] <imsky> Dave_Stein: generally i can't control FOUC, it depends on internet speed, javascript speed, and stylesheet filesize
[18:39:00] <imsky> server-side compilation defeats the purpose, namsayin?
[18:39:10] <Dave_Stein> imsky: yeah I'm honestly not sure how you'd fix FOUC
[18:39:21] <imsky> Dave_Stein: paul irish and some other bros looked into it
[18:39:24] <Dave_Stein> imsky: cause the shits gonna load unless you hide it first and then it'd flash in
[18:39:36] <iszak> no one cares about FOUC
[18:39:47] <imsky> Dave_Stein: i might look into immediate parsing instead of domready parsing
[18:39:47] <Dave_Stein> imsky: tell that to ProSite users holy shit they were mad haha
[18:39:52] <imsky> prosite?
[18:40:02] <Dave_Stein> yeah that website builder i made in JS
[18:40:10] <imsky> oh you used cssfx there?
[18:40:14] <Dave_Stein> no no
[18:40:18] <Dave_Stein> typekit loves FOUC
[18:40:24] <cuongnda> Hello, How can I get the filename of the xml file downloaded using ajax call?
[18:40:25] <Dave_Stein> im glad they were bought by adobe, hopefully they'll get some real improvements
[18:40:28] <imsky> oh yeah, right, as does cufon
[18:40:43] <imsky> HERE COMES SOME SWFOBJECTS BRO
[18:40:44] <iszak> Dave_Stein, I'm guessing anyone using a website builder like ProSite are n00bz
[18:41:00] <Dave_Stein> iszak: they aren't programmers - they're designers so of course
[18:41:10] <Dave_Stein> iszak: and they don't know/care about FOUC - they just want their site to be good
[18:41:17] <Dave_Stein> on a hilarious related note
[18:41:30] <Dave_Stein> we get complaints of users about their website having a "white flash" aka the next page loading since it's not AJAX
[18:41:43] <iszak> Dave_Stein, should use static image with image map, pro results.
[18:41:51] <Dave_Stein> iszak: hahaha
[18:41:53] <imsky> Dave_Stein: it's been written how to fix this... in cssfx's case it's a bit more sophistiacted though
[18:41:58] <imsky> you should have no prob in fixing it
[18:42:18] <Dave_Stein> imsky: i'm pretty sure my coworker fixed it by now. cause i remember those complaints and they don't happen anymore, i believe
[18:42:26] <Dave_Stein> imsky: i really stayed away from the process cause typekit annoyed me for so many reasons
[18:42:27] <imsky> killed the complainers eh
[18:42:55] <iszak> people love to complain lets face it, they'll find someone else to complain about, e.g. why does this page take ages to load on my 56k modem
[18:42:56] <Dave_Stein> imsky: for instance my text editor would show the font inside the editor... but guess what? you can't do that with a typekit font since it uses JS to load

[18:50:09] <Dave_Stein> win
[18:50:10] <Dave_Stein> ttyl
[18:50:10] <joikus> can I trigger .fancybox() using jquery? $('a#someid').click() ?
[18:50:13] <imsky> later Dave_Stein
[18:50:18] <Dave_Stein> $('#el').fancybox works
[18:50:20] <Dave_Stein> auto click
[18:50:21] <Dave_Stein> or
[18:50:30] <Dave_Stein> $.fancybox({content:'hi'}) inside click callback if you want
[18:50:32] <Dave_Stein> ttyl for real
[18:51:24] <joikus> auto click?
[18:51:24] <joikus> meh
[18:51:45] <carl0> How do I disable the fancybox when hide the image? Just for this image.
[18:55:59] <subsonic> Basically, I'm adding an element into the page that's dragable, but, because it's relative, it causes it's container to push down.  I want it to be absolute to pull out of the flow.
[19:00:27] <abjorn> BACK IMSKY so sup dawg
[19:00:57] <imsky> talking to mah clientz in asia
[19:01:04] <abjorn> asian clients? damn dawg
[19:01:10] <abjorn> wtf why is my fan off
[19:01:14] <abjorn> so hot in here
[19:01:15] <imsky> FRIED PSU
[19:01:45] <subsonic> Oh, it only goes position relative when assigned to a container
[19:04:13] <imsky> abjorn: that was a quick LoL sesh
[19:06:45] <abjorn> yeah the new dominion game mode usually lasts around 20 minutes
[19:07:13] <abjorn> its fun
[19:07:36] <imsky> nice mayne
[19:07:39] <cypha> abjorn, what's $. signify?

[19:07:55] <abjorn> apparently nothing
[19:07:58] <cypha> $.post, $.whatever
[19:08:02] <abjorn> oh
[19:08:05] <abjorn> oh what is $
[19:08:06] <abjorn> that's
[19:08:10] <abjorn> the jquery objet
[19:08:12] <abjorn> *object
[19:08:17] <abjorn> it's a shorthand for it
[19:08:20] <imsky> = jQuery
[19:08:22] <cypha> k
[19:08:29] <abjorn> === jQuery
[19:08:31] <cypha> thanks
[19:08:49] <cypha> post is an attribute of jquery
[19:08:57] <abjorn> yep, a method
[19:09:09] <imsky> !==!
[19:09:11] <cypha> and $(document) , document is an argument of jquery
[19:09:14] <imsky> ?js !==!
[19:09:15] <bot-t> imsky: SyntaxError: syntax error
[19:09:20] <imsky> i lubs u
[19:09:31] <abjorn> so, imsky, im starting up my JS game engine again:
[19:09:32] <abjorn> https://github.com/Abjorn/proto-engine
[19:09:32] <abjorn> Moved it over to git last night. Haven't moved over all the code yet, cause im still doing a shit ton of refactoring
[19:09:45] <imsky> abjorn: bro you know the first law of game engines
[19:09:47] <imsky> tech demo
[19:09:52] <abjorn> lol
[19:09:54] <abjorn> I had one
[19:09:57] <abjorn> not anymore
[19:10:07] <abjorn> cypha: document is...well, the document. the html document
[19:10:16] <abjorn> $(document) wraps the document object
[19:10:21] <abjorn> in the jweries
[19:10:35] <cypha> jweries?
[19:10:39] <cypha> queries?
[19:10:43] <imsky> jabokweries
[19:10:44] <abjorn> yes.
[19:10:49] <abjorn> jaboqwery
[19:10:54] <imsky> jabokwerys
[19:10:59] <cypha> jqwerty?
[19:11:01] <imsky> jabokweryz
[19:11:05] <abjorn> jahbokweriez
[19:11:33] <imsky> oh lawd
[19:11:42] <cypha> so that is equivalent to jquery(document)?
[19:11:52] <imsky> abjorn: what are you gonna do with proto?
[19:11:59] <abjorn> make games
[19:12:04] <abjorn> with javascript
[19:12:07] <imsky> no you're not
[19:12:12] <cypha> and jquery accepts arguments and gives them methods/attributes like .ready
[19:12:14] <imsky> your life will be 99% DEBUGGING THE GOTTAM ENGINE
[19:12:20] <abjorn> doubtful
[19:12:25] <imsky> o rly?
[19:12:25] <abjorn> I'm more likely to code around bugs
[19:12:26] <abjorn> lol
[19:12:30] <imsky> u r a sly fox
[19:12:37] <abjorn> rite?
[19:12:45] <imsky> what is it a fork/port of?
[19:12:58] <abjorn> nothing
[19:13:13] <imsky> maaaan
[19:13:23] <abjorn> well
[19:13:24] <abjorn> sorta
[19:13:28] <imsky> if you wanna make games, there are tons of canvas engines out there
[19:13:36] <abjorn> yeah but those perform like shit
[19:13:43] <imsky> so you're writing a performant engine?
[19:13:48] <abjorn> even on the latest beta browsers with hardware accel and shit
[19:13:58] <abjorn> more or less
[19:14:14] <abjorn> it's kind of less an engine and more a platform to create native games in javascript
[19:14:26] <imsky> ok release tech demo
[19:14:35] <abjorn> most of it is really just a wrapper around sfml
[19:14:36] <imsky> and then i shall promoat
[19:14:40] <abjorn> well i
[19:14:42] <abjorn> had one
[19:14:42] <imsky> oh wait NATIVE games?
[19:14:45] <abjorn> yeah
[19:14:50] <imsky> broao
[19:14:53] <abjorn> v8/sfml
[19:15:08] <imsky> i garontee you'll be knee-deep in C++ 2 weeks from now
[19:15:08] <abjorn> V8 is the shit as far as the C++ API goes.
[19:15:10] <nickadeemus2002> hello! has anyone here developed any new jquery plugins recently?
[19:15:15] <abjorn> I'm used to it
[19:15:21] <imsky> nickadeemus2002: yes
[19:15:23] <abjorn> I've been working on this engine for like a year
[19:15:24] <abjorn> lol
[19:15:25] <imsky> abjorn: i salute you little bugger
[19:15:36] <abjorn> There's a lot more C++ than what's in that repo
[19:15:37] <nickadeemus2002> imsky, kewl
[19:15:38] <abjorn> a lot more
[19:15:48] <abjorn> i made
[19:15:50] <abjorn> jq-wiggle
[19:15:53] <abjorn> best plugin ever
[19:15:57] <nickadeemus2002> was it a client requirement, or was it something you just wanted to build
[19:15:58] <nickadeemus2002> >: )
[19:16:02] <imsky> nickadeemus2002: both
[19:16:17] <imsky> i've built datepickers, messaging systems, etc
[19:16:21] <abjorn> https://github.com/Abjorn/jquery-wiggle
[19:16:21] <abjorn> The only plugin you will ever need
[19:16:32] <imsky> jquery is pretty goddamn indestructible when it comes to molding it to your wishes
[19:16:40] <nickadeemus2002> hmm....i'm at the point where i would like to do something "professional" with jquery
[19:16:46] <abjorn> you say that now, imsky
[19:16:51] <nickadeemus2002> so for me, that means building a solid plugin
[19:17:13] <nickadeemus2002> i'm trying to see where there is a need for a plugin..
[19:17:21] <nickadeemus2002> i don't want to build anything trivial
[19:17:29] <abjorn> I saw a need
[19:17:33] <abjorn> I saw where wiggle was not
[19:17:34] <abjorn> and I said
[19:17:34] <imsky> nickadeemus2002: there are tons of things you can do with jquery
[19:17:37] <abjorn> "No. That will not do."
[19:17:44] <nickadeemus2002> and i don't want to replicate 1 of 2-00000000 plugins that already exist
[19:17:46] <imsky> wiggle seriously filled a hole in the universe
[19:17:55] <abjorn> it stopped the universe from collapsing
[19:17:58] <abjorn> due to the giant hole
[19:17:59] <nickadeemus2002> ha
[19:18:25] <abjorn> nickadeemus2002, you're going to have to live with the fact that if you need it, there's probably a plugin for it
[19:18:32] <abjorn> I made sure of that when i created jq-wiggle
[19:18:39] <imsky> nickadeemus2002: generally, if you're building something with jquery as plugin host, you have to either focus on DOM or on integrating with another plugin
[19:18:45] <LocalPCGuy> have you thought about going through the jQuery bog reports and fixing a couple of bugs?
[19:18:51] <abjorn> that doesn't mean there's going to be a GOOD plugin for something
[19:18:51] <imsky> if you're not doing either of those, build standalone
[19:18:52] <abjorn> just that
[19:18:54] <abjorn> there will be one
[19:19:06] <nickadeemus2002> see, that's part of the problem.  i want to build my stuff from scratch.  i hate to "borrow" tons of plugins and slow down a site
[19:19:11] <abjorn> LocalPCGuy: I thought about it then I remembered I work 40 hours a week and would rather not
[19:19:17] <nickadeemus2002> and have to maintain X# of plugins
[19:19:37] <LocalPCGuy> lol, I understand that and have a similar "problem"
[19:19:50] <abjorn> whether you use other peoples plugins or make your own, that likely won't stop you from slowing down your site with them
[19:19:56] <abjorn> I mean, unless you're ben_alman
[19:20:05] <imsky> jquery plugins = written by the left side of the bell curve, except for ben alman
[19:20:09] <nickadeemus2002> yes, i have to take over a site with 10 jquery plugins that seem to not work well
[19:20:18] <abjorn> ben_alman IS the bell curve
[19:20:21] <imsky> ben alman is the whole right side of the bell curve
[19:20:27] <abjorn> yeah that
[19:20:33] <imsky> abjorn: don't fale statistics bro
[19:20:44] <abjorn> I don't fale anything
[19:20:50] <nickadeemus2002> abjorn, i'm hoping to use js frameworks like backbone.js and underscore.js with my jquery plugins
[19:21:02] <abjorn> underscore isn't a framework but yeah sure
[19:21:14] <abjorn> that's just more bloat though, if you wanna trim something down that's not the way to go
[19:21:23] <imsky> nickadeemus2002 likes buzzwords a lot
[19:21:25] <nickadeemus2002> and make the code more structured, rather than having a ton of selectors sprawled about in source with no apparent logic or organization
[19:21:29] <imsky> I WANT TO USE BACKBONE FOR NO PARITCULAR REASON
[19:21:29] <abjorn> I find it hard to ever justify frameworks like those
[19:22:11] <abjorn> i tried to justify them once and thought
[19:22:24] <abjorn> "This is a lot of things to learn when I'm not gonna need almost all of it."
[19:22:31] <nickadeemus2002> nah, don't care about buzzwords.  just tired of multiple js files with unrelated selectors and functions that make no sense.
[19:22:33] <imsky> a heuristic for life
[19:22:36] <cypha> abjorn, what's the process(data) method?
[19:22:45] <imsky> nickadeemus2002: you're coding blind then
[19:22:50] <abjorn> So then I said fuck it and decided to use the Namespace pattern and dataview.js
[19:23:15] <abjorn> nickadeemus2002: a framework doesn't solve that
[19:23:30] <abjorn> organizing yourself and adhering to best practices solves that
[19:23:38] <imsky> also coding a huge project solves that
[19:23:42] <imsky> no room to fuck around
[19:23:42] <abjorn> lol
[19:23:47] <abjorn> no there's room...
[19:23:50] <imsky> noap
[19:23:55] <nickadeemus2002> sure, i have 4 huge projects.
[19:23:57] <abjorn> *sigh* people...have..made room.
[19:24:07] <imsky> abjorn: people at hostgator? :D
[19:24:12] <abjorn> no
[19:24:13] <nickadeemus2002> 2 of those have really sloppy code
[19:24:25] <abjorn> we don't have anything very js heavy accept the chat app
[19:24:30] <abjorn> and they are making that a lot better
[19:24:36] <abjorn> not as good as *I* would but still
[19:24:48] <abjorn> no im more thinking
[19:24:59] <abjorn> that .NET mobile app I did js debugging for
[19:25:02] <abjorn> that...that was awful...
[19:25:07] <LocalPCGuy> if you haven't, take the time to read through this: https://github.com/cowboy/talks/blob/master/jquery-plugin-authoring.js
[19:25:12] <abjorn> outsourced indian programming......
[19:25:18] <abjorn> it was...awful...
[19:25:18] <imsky> racist
[19:25:32] <abjorn> no, see, a regular indian programmer is good
[19:25:38] <abjorn> but an outsourced indian programmer
[19:25:39] <abjorn> is awful.
[19:25:50] <PrgmrBill> most outsource experiences aren't too awesome
[19:25:57] <abjorn> yeah pretty much
[19:26:01] * PrgmrBill worked with outsourced ukranians
[19:26:13] <nickadeemus2002> --> outsourced indian programming......    <--   bane of my existence
[19:26:18] <abjorn> well I can't imagine many experiences with ukranians turns out well
[19:26:20] <imsky> racists!
[19:26:25] <abjorn> particularly mail order brides
[19:26:55] <nickadeemus2002> yes, see, on some of my sites, i'm primarily hired to refactor code
[19:27:10] <abjorn> No, but really, nickadeemus2002, the namespace pattern is the way to go.
[19:27:14] <nickadeemus2002> since it was outsourced.  then the second thing is to help improve performance.
[19:27:26] <imsky> so indian programmers create work for you
[19:27:29] <imsky> they literally feed you
[19:28:02] <abjorn> also, linking data to ui is good for large apps, I like dataview.js:
[19:28:02] <abjorn> http://dataviewjs.com
[19:28:10] <nickadeemus2002> so, LocalPCGuy suggested looking at jquery bugs and offering to fix them....where can i get a list of bugs for plugins and have at it?
[19:28:14] <nickadeemus2002> sorry to be so newb
[19:28:27] <abjorn> find the github page
[19:28:27] <cypha> abjorn, process(data)?
[19:28:29] <abjorn> assuming there is one
[19:28:31] <abjorn> ?process
[19:28:34] <bot-t> abjorn, #8854 (Bug in minifier process)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 6 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8854
[19:28:36] <abjorn> bot-t is slow today
[19:28:36] <LocalPCGuy> pick your favorite plugins based on github and look at the issues
[19:28:38] <nickadeemus2002> imsky: they help pay for my house...pays the mortgage
[19:28:46] <cypha> thanks abjorn
[19:28:46] <LocalPCGuy> or what abjorn said ;)
[19:28:47] <abjorn> where are you seeing process(data), cypha
[19:29:03] <cypha> just reading through the api
[19:29:07] <abjorn> wat page
[19:29:13] <cypha> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[19:29:47] <abjorn> oh, in one of the examples?
[19:29:50] <cypha> yup
[19:29:53] <abjorn> $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" },
[19:29:53] <abjorn>  function(data) {
[19:29:53] <abjorn>    process(data);
[19:29:53] <abjorn>  },
[19:29:53] <abjorn>  "xml"
[19:29:53] <abjorn> );
[19:29:57] <cypha> yes sir
[19:29:58] <abjorn> yeah that's just a dummy function
[19:30:06] <abjorn> it's just making a point
[19:30:12] <abjorn> that that's where you process the data
[19:30:21] <nickadeemus2002> LocalPCGuy: thanks for the suggestions.  I don't have any favorite plugins ; )  are there a few you recommend?  do you know of any that need bug fixes?
[19:30:24] <abjorn> they coulda just put // process data
[19:30:46] <LocalPCGuy> https://github.com/jackmoore/colorbox/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed
[19:32:01] <abjorn> imsky: know C++?
[19:32:03] <nickadeemus2002> thanks. i'll start there.
[19:32:20] <imsky> abjorn: i know C and rudimentary C++, going to learn it at some point soon
[19:32:29] <abjorn> o
[19:32:36] <abjorn> was gonna say, "Help me with ProtoEngine!"
[19:32:38] <imsky> i figured out that for what i want to do, doing it in scripting languages is hilarious
[19:32:47] <abjorn> lol
[19:32:56] <abjorn> yeah, i mean, you can't use it for everything
[19:33:00] <abjorn> sometimes you just gotta do C
[19:33:03] * imsky sighs
[19:33:03] <LocalPCGuy> you may want to send a note to the author though, and make sure they may be willing to integrate your bug fixes before spending time doing it.  Many will...but good to make sure
[19:33:05] <abjorn> or C++
[19:33:09] <abjorn> UNFORTUNATELY
[19:33:12] <abjorn> I'd rather not
[19:33:25] <abjorn> LocalPCGuy: That's what forking then making a pull request is for.
[19:33:26] <LocalPCGuy> and jackmoore is a pretty good guy in my limited experience interacting with him
[19:33:34] <LocalPCGuy> yah
[19:33:36] <abjorn> Just do it, if it's good, and the creator isn't an idiot, then he'll pull it
[19:33:38] <imsky> LocalPCGuy: where are you local to
[19:33:46] <imsky> i feel like you're local to me
[19:33:48] <abjorn> if not then just keep going with your own fork and bam you'll have a better plugin than his
[19:33:48] <LocalPCGuy> heh...near Ann Arobr, MI
[19:33:53] <LocalPCGuy> Ann Arbor
[19:33:54] <imsky> that's not local
[19:33:58] <abjorn> that's not local at all
[19:34:00] <LocalPCGuy> I know
[19:34:00] <imsky> that's like...a 7 hour drive
[19:34:04] <abjorn> that's like
[19:34:06] <abjorn>  a 3 day drive
[19:34:11] <imsky> haaha texas
[19:34:15] <imsky> the loser of commutes
[19:34:19] <abjorn> nuh uh
[19:34:22] <imsky> ya huh
[19:34:29] <abjorn> although it does take 4 hours to get anywhere
[19:34:32] <imsky> lol
[19:34:33] <LocalPCGuy> I may just change my nic to nonLocalPCGuy
[19:34:36] <abjorn> anywhere out of state anyways
[19:34:37] <imsky> it's a huge state at the south of the country
[19:34:42] <imsky> it IS the loser bro
[19:34:45] <abjorn> actually usually more than 4 hours
[19:34:57] <abjorn> takes almost 6 to get to louisiana
[19:35:02] <abjorn> but who wants to go there anyways
[19:35:04] <imsky> that's like right next door
[19:35:10] <abjorn> well from austin
[19:35:15] <imsky> oh yeah
[19:35:19] <imsky> how's the weather there anyway
[19:35:24] <imsky> we got INDIAN FALL in indiana here
[19:35:25] <abjorn> if I lived in texarkana i could walk to another state
[19:35:28] <cypha> abjorn, so they made up process(data) right there?
[19:35:36] <cypha> process isn't actually a builtin method?
[19:35:36] <abjorn> it's been rainy, finally
[19:35:38] <abjorn> ending the drought
[19:35:40] <imsky> wat
[19:35:41] <imsky> how dare you
[19:35:47] <imsky> it's been 83 here
[19:35:49] <abjorn> yes cypha
[19:35:49] <imsky> after like 37
[19:35:55] <cypha> ah ok
[19:35:59] <abjorn> it's just some bullshit to show that that's what you're supposed to do there
[19:36:58] <abjorn> uggggh C++ style generics in Dart
[19:37:01] <abjorn> that's going to be
[19:37:01] <abjorn> slow
[19:37:05] <imsky> lol
[19:37:12] <imsky> oh yeah right
[19:37:14] <abjorn> Seriously, that alone will slow down the language.
[19:37:14] <imsky> emscripten exists
[19:37:17] <imsky> so technically
[19:37:20] <imsky> you could compile C++ to JS
[19:37:26] <imsky> which will run on an engine written in C++
[19:37:28] <abjorn> yeah although it's not going to work all that well
[19:38:01] <imsky> i'll pay you 5 bucks to port c++ to js
[19:38:06] <abjorn> fuck that
[19:38:08] <abjorn> why would anyone do that
[19:38:17] <imsky> and i don't mean the AST or whatever
[19:38:23] <imsky> i mean the GNU TOOLCHAIN BITCH
[19:38:30] <abjorn> the only reason to ever do that is for bragging rights
[19:38:32] <abjorn> which is not a good reason
[19:38:40] <imsky> technically jslinux exists
[19:38:41] <imsky> so...
[19:38:49] <imsky> they already have gcc
[19:38:56] <cypha> abjorn, what's the difference btwn $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" },
[19:39:02] <Dave_Stein> imsky: just read that article and a few others. it seems to be useful to do meta keywords if you keep them down to a minimum
[19:39:13] <cypha> and { "name": "John", "time":"2pm"}?
[19:39:26] <imsky> Dave_Stein: that's for some olde-style engines probably. google doesn't care, just read wikipedia
[19:39:30] <imsky> ?g wikipedia meta keywords
[19:39:30] <cypha> is it retrieved any differently server-side?
[19:39:31] <bot-t> imsky, Meta element - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element
[19:39:43] <abjorn> no, cypha
[19:39:44] <Dave_Stein> cypha: no
[19:39:45] <abjorn> it's the same
[19:39:46] <imsky> Dave_Stein: "With respect to Google, thirty-seven leaders in search engine optimization concluded in April 2007 that the relevance of having your keywords in the meta-attribute keywords is little to none"
[19:39:51] <cypha> ok, cool, gracias
[19:40:02] <abjorn> using quotations around object keys just lets you use special characters like -
[19:40:04] <abjorn> so like
[19:40:08] <abjorn> "hello-world" as an object key
[19:40:16] <abjorn> course, that's the only way you can access that member, then
[19:40:16] <cypha> aah, interesting
[19:40:17] <Dave_Stein> lol
[19:40:24] <Dave_Stein> imsky: i went to the footnote for that quote
[19:40:24] <abjorn> and I wouldn't suggest it tbh
[19:40:28] <Dave_Stein> http://sangers.nu/blog/tech/20080909-the-meta-tag-attribute--keywords
[19:40:31] <LocalPCGuy> quotes also lets you use words that would normally be restricted like function
[19:40:31] <cypha> yeah, I'd prolly never use that
[19:40:36] <imsky> 403 bitches!
[19:40:38] <abjorn> FORBIDDEN
[19:40:50] <imsky> archive.org to the rescue
[19:40:56] <Dave_Stein> those guys certainly know about SEO - anyway the wiki still says Yahoo counts em
[19:41:00] <abjorn> okay I really need that paid day off, I can't see a 403 without feeling compelled to debug it
[19:41:08] <imsky> Dave_Stein: yahoo uses google for search..or is it bing
[19:41:12] <Dave_Stein> bing
[19:41:31] <imsky> yeah forget yahoo
[19:41:45] <Dave_Stein> let me settle that about yahoo
[19:41:45] <cypha> what's console.log?
[19:41:45] <Dave_Stein> one sec
[19:41:56] <abjorn> it's a bugging tool
[19:42:02] <cypha> firebug
[19:42:06] <objNoob> for firebug
[19:42:07] <abjorn> if you're using chrome or have firebug in ff
[19:42:09] <cypha> in the console tab, on the right side
[19:42:19] <abjorn> it outputs text to the js console
[19:42:19] <cypha> i can type "data" without the quotes
[19:42:21] <imsky> TIME TO WORK
[19:42:24] <imsky> while also talking on irc
[19:42:27] <cypha> and it gives me the value when I click "run"
[19:42:53] <cypha> what's that have to with console.log?
[19:43:01] <abjorn> im kind of curious if there's a C++ API for Dart now
[19:43:05] <cypha> oh, i see, it outputs text there
[19:43:06] <abjorn> I wanna see if it's similar to V8's
[19:43:11] <abjorn> cause V8 has an awesome C++ API
[19:43:19] <imsky> Dave_Stein: to clear everything up: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK7IPbnmvVU
[19:43:25] <Dave_Stein> imsky: lol my search engine traffic goes google, indeed, search yahoo, bing
[19:43:32] <cypha> abjorn, what do you like to use c++ for?
[19:43:35] <imsky> Dave_Stein: mine is 100% google
[19:43:46] <Dave_Stein> imsky: my google traffic is over 1.1 mil so far this month
[19:43:47] <nickadeemus2002> alright then.  thanks for all the info.  i'm off to work on some plugin bug fixes.  shalom my jquery peeps.
[19:43:52] <Dave_Stein> the other 3 dont even total 50k
[19:44:01] <abjorn> cypha: working on a game engine: https://github.com/Abjorn/proto-engine
[19:44:03] <imsky> yeah google is pretty boss
[19:44:06] <imsky> check the video though
[19:44:10] <cypha> Dave_Stein, how can I get information like that on my site?
[19:44:15] <Dave_Stein> google analytics
[19:44:21] <imsky> = crap
[19:44:28] <abjorn> Dave_Stein: What site?
[19:44:38] <cypha> I can't just get the url from where the person came easily?
[19:44:39] <imsky> learning2urchin is a waste of time
[19:44:46] <cypha> it's not in the request or whatever
[19:44:51] <abjorn> yeah it is
[19:44:57] <Dave_Stein> imsky: ah well, the keywords dont hurt and at least i use proper tags and whatnot still :)
[19:45:08] <abjorn> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer
[19:45:09] <Dave_Stein> i got online portfolio averaging 9 right now
[19:45:24] <imsky> Dave_Stein: lol that's true, YOU WILL BE PRESERVED FOR POSTERITY
[19:45:25] <Dave_Stein> so i must be doing something right ha
[19:45:33] <imsky> as long as behance exists
[19:45:55] <Dave_Stein> woot
[19:46:23] <cypha> nice, i see it
[19:46:36] <abjorn> hm, so apparently the latest version of C++ that recently got accepted as standard is even faster than C++ was before
[19:46:38] <abjorn> so thats cool
[19:46:47] <imsky> finally, as fast as c
[19:46:51] <abjorn> lol
[19:47:01] <abjorn> probably marginally less than C (i.e. not even noticable)
[19:47:13] <imsky> yeap, just look at the shootout
[19:47:30] <abjorn> but no really, the latest C++ version is pretty bitchin, it makes it more bearable
[19:47:35] <abjorn> type deduction and all that
[19:47:44] <imsky> sounds a lot like type inference
[19:49:09] <abjorn> one of the new features i like a lot is constant expressions:
[19:49:09] <abjorn> double foo = 1;
[19:49:09] <abjorn> constexpr double bar = foo + 1;
[19:49:15] <abjorn> so then bar will always be foo + 1
[19:49:49] <imsky> sounds like a function?
[19:50:13] <abjorn> yeah but less code
[19:50:21] <imsky> progress :D
[19:50:41] <abjorn> oh there's also lambda functions
[19:50:47] <abjorn> but it's C++ so it's still really  bastardized
[19:50:51] <imsky> so it's turning into C# slowly
[19:50:57] <abjorn> yeah just not nearly as nice
[19:51:14] <abjorn> oh, there's for in loops now
[19:51:19] <abjorn> that too
[19:51:48] <Dave_Stein> imsky: you got me reading too much SEO crap now *sigh* sitemaps can eat my...
[19:52:05] <bonder> Does JDownloader have spyware
[19:52:06] <imsky> welcome to the thunderdome baby
[19:52:33] <abjorn> no amount of SEO
[19:52:38] <abjorn> is a replacement for good original content
[19:52:42] <abjorn> just sayin
[19:52:48] <abjorn> you may raise your rank 1 or 2 places
[19:52:50] <abjorn> but still
[19:52:54] <Dave_Stein> abjorn: that is correct
[19:53:24] <Dave_Stein> although there is one trick that is still great but doesn't apply to most places
[19:53:34] <imsky> facebook sent me a email: Help us improve your advertising experience on Facebook!
[19:53:39] <imsky> advertising is a art
[19:53:58] <Dave_Stein> the fact that high power sites linking to your site helps, means the more sites you have that gain popularity, it snowballs
[19:54:02] <abjorn> [](int x, int y) -> int { int z = x + y; return z; }
[19:54:02] <abjorn> C++ new lambda function syntax leaves something to be desired but still
[19:54:18] <Dave_Stein> ie theserved.com sites
[19:54:33] <Dave_Stein> but they all have good content so its well-deserved :)
[19:54:49] <Dave_Stein> ?g industrial design
[19:54:50] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, Industrial design - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design
[19:54:55] <Dave_Stein> damn you wiki beating me out
[19:54:59] <Dave_Stein> im below wiki for that one
[19:54:59] <abjorn> or you can hack the system and get multiple bullshit sites on different C-Class IPs to link to your site
[19:55:07] <abjorn> i.e., seohosting!
[19:55:14] <imsky> BLOCK HOT
[19:55:14] <bonder> could you help me find the URL for this mashup and map data (so I can add &output=kml). The URL I want is from http://www.geology.arkansas.gov/minerals/mining_map.htm
[19:55:24] <Dave_Stein> yeah but once you're found out youre screwed
[19:55:26] <abjorn> http://seohosting.com
[19:55:29] <abjorn> idk why we have that
[19:55:31] <abjorn> i dont know
[19:55:44] <abjorn> it's like our bastard child
[19:56:11] <Dave_Stein> ha wow
[19:56:13] <abjorn> SEO Hosting (A HostGator Company)
[19:56:23] <Dave_Stein> yeah i saw, i remember youre from there
[19:56:33] <abjorn> you wouldn't believe how much demand there is for this kind of thing
[19:56:38] <Dave_Stein> but arent they all suckers?
[19:56:43] <abjorn> well
[19:56:44] <abjorn> sorta
[19:56:46] <abjorn> I mean like
[19:56:48] <abjorn> it works
[19:56:54] <abjorn> if you do it right
[19:57:02] <abjorn> we don't teach you to do it right but still
[19:57:23] <abjorn> tbh, the tips we give here are more important than the seohosting method:
[19:57:23] <abjorn> http://www.seohosting.com/seo-tips.php
[19:57:59] <abjorn> get a compliant, working site that loads quick with good content, with relevant keywords. seriously all you REALLY need to do
[19:58:00] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[19:58:10] <abjorn> anything more is just a lot of work for not a lot of payoff
[19:58:13] <Dave_Stein> im amazed google doesnt just shoot people down for those tricks like "oh i see youre from seohosting.com fuck you"
[19:58:33] <imsky> wut
[19:58:49] <abjorn> I wouldn't be surprised if they did at some point.
[19:59:05] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[19:59:09] <Dave_Stein> id be surprised if they didnt
[19:59:21] <Dave_Stein> its like they are advertising a way to rip off search engines and the search engines are liek "okay"
[19:59:24] <abjorn> what's stupid is most people will use private nameservers with it
[19:59:27] <abjorn> so then google's like
[19:59:41] <imsky> BLOCK LOST
[19:59:48] <Dave_Stein> i'd say getting to first page of online portfolio in 3 months isnt so bad for me :)
[19:59:51] <abjorn> hmmm a bunch of sites linking each other...but they ARE on different C-Classes....oh wait, all of them have the same private nameservers.
[19:59:59] <cypha> is $form = $(form)?
[20:00:05] <imsky> cypha: no
[20:00:09] <abjorn> if you make it that lol
[20:00:16] <abjorn> $form whatever you make it brah
[20:00:23] <abjorn> it's not defined unless you define it
[20:00:24] <Dave_Stein> i make all my jquery object vars start with $ to avoid any possible confusion between $element and element jquery vs dom node
[20:00:31] <cypha>     var $form = $( this ),
[20:00:31] <cypha>         term = $form.find( 'input[name="s"]' ).val(),
[20:00:31] <cypha>         url = $form.attr( 'action' );
[20:00:36] <Dave_Stein> i'm surprised i don't see that elsewhere more often
[20:00:50] <abjorn> because some of us find that ugly (me)
[20:01:02] <cypha> cool, so it's just part of the variable name
[20:01:06] <Dave_Stein> abjorn its only ugly when its obj.$poo
[20:01:07] <abjorn> yeah
[20:01:10] <abjorn> lol
[20:01:10] <Dave_Stein> :)
[20:01:13] <cypha> Dave_Stein, I think that's a useful way to organize it
[20:01:19] <abjorn> it doesn't help that its poo, Dave_Stein
[20:01:24] <Dave_Stein> it certainly helps noobs/interns
[20:01:26] <Dave_Stein> abjorn: poo always helps
[20:01:27] <abjorn> lol
[20:01:35] <Dave_Stein> cause there's frequent confusion of whats a jquery obj vs dom
[20:01:41] <cypha> how can #form = something with commas in btwn?
[20:01:45] <Dave_Stein> esp in regards to this
[20:01:46] <cypha> i mean $form
[20:02:00] <warrenparsons> Another vote for prefixing variables containing jQuery objects with $.
[20:02:01] <Dave_Stein> it's valid if you don't use more than one var statement
[20:02:16] <Dave_Stein> its more error prone ( esp for IE ) but its clearer to have one var statement in my opinon. that one is debated a lot
[20:02:25] <imsky> warrenparsons: read the js spec, that's a dumb idea
[20:02:43] <Dave_Stein> imsky: why?
[20:02:48] <warrenparsons> imsky: cite the part of the spec that says it's a dumb idea.
[20:02:49] <imsky> oh lawd
[20:03:00] <Dave_Stein> imsky: the spec is too big for me to read and respond right now :D
[20:03:24] <Dave_Stein> warrenparsons: you only get screwed using $ to denote jquery object when using UI too since it has like ui.element
[20:04:07] <cypha> how can--> var $form = $(this), term = $form.find('something').val(), url = $form.attr('action'); ?
[20:04:16] <cypha> like what're those commas after $(this)
[20:04:22] <Dave_Stein> cypha: its just allowed syntax, i told you :)
[20:04:25] <warrenparsons> Dave_Stein: I'll blow up that bridge when I run into it.
[20:04:37] <cypha> how is the variable $form equal to those 3 things?
[20:04:44] <Dave_Stein> oi oi oi
[20:04:54] <Dave_Stein> they are each equal to their own line
[20:04:58] <Dave_Stein> $form is = to something
[20:05:00] <Dave_Stein> term is equal to something
[20:05:03] <Dave_Stein> url is equal to third thing
[20:05:10] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: i want to see how many times you can explain this
[20:05:10] <cypha> oh, so ',' is another way of writing ';'?
[20:05:11] <Dave_Stein> you really really really need to read up more on JS before using jquery
[20:05:21] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: eternity long
[20:05:33] <Dave_Stein> cypha: yes except if you fuck up youll accidentally have global vars
[20:05:54] <cypha> ooh, i see
[20:06:02] <cypha> so it's so I don't have to write "var" each time over
[20:06:05] <Dave_Stein> and if you fuck up IE will yell at you instaed of turning things global
[20:06:14] <Dave_Stein> yes
[20:06:18] <cypha> cool
[20:06:24] <Dave_Stein> as i said earlier
[20:06:24] <Dave_Stein> <Dave_Stein> it's valid if you don't use more than one var statement
[20:06:24] <Dave_Stein> <Dave_Stein> its more error prone ( esp for IE ) but its clearer to have one var statement in my opinon. that one is debated a lot
[20:06:25] <warrenparsons> Yeah, not a fan of comma separated vars because of increased chance for unintended globals.
[20:06:39] <cypha> sorry, I missed that from you
[20:06:50] <Dave_Stein> warrenparsons: i mean it might be okay but i make everyone jslint with "allow one var statement per function"
[20:07:02] <Dave_Stein> otherwise some douche might put avr in the middle of the func and id have to kill them
[20:07:08] <imsky> ?js var p = Math.PI; p*p
[20:07:09] <bot-t> imsky: 9.869604401089358
[20:07:30] <warrenparsons> Dave_Stein: I use linting and try to get everyone on my team to do so. It's not the trailing comma issue that bothers me.
[20:07:33] <Dave_Stein> haha i didnt know PI was a constant - for some reason ive never needed that
[20:07:48] <Dave_Stein> so why wouldnt you just use commas and one var statement?
[20:07:59] <abjorn> ?js new Array(12).join("lol" + 2) + " batman!"
[20:07:59] <bot-t> abjorn: "lol2lol2lol2lol2lol2lol2lol2lol2lol2lol2lol2 batman!"
[20:08:01] <imsky> wut
[20:08:05] <abjorn> well that didnt work
[20:08:06] <imsky> lolfale
[20:08:07] <abjorn> wait what
[20:08:10] <abjorn> oh
[20:08:11] <warrenparsons> Dave_Stein: because muscle memory is to type a semicolon at the end of each line.
[20:08:16] <Dave_Stein> haha
[20:08:18] <abjorn> ?js new Array(12).join("lol" - 2) + " batman!"
[20:08:18] <bot-t> abjorn: "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN batman!"
[20:08:25] <imsky> mmmmMBATAMANARU
[20:08:31] <Dave_Stein> well i gotta tell you lately i've been putting semicolons after public function x() { }; in PHP and getting fatal errors
[20:08:41] <imsky> Dave_Stein: why are you doing that
[20:08:55] <Dave_Stein> ?js Array(16).join('lol' - 2).toString().replace(/aN/g,'aan, ') + 'is my favorite bread!!!';
[20:08:55] <bot-t> Dave_Stein: "Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, Naan, is my favorite bread!!!"
[20:09:06] <warrenparsons> As far as I'm concerned, a few extra 3-char instances of "var" won't hurt anybody.
[20:09:07] <Dave_Stein> imsky: cause ive been writing JS too long during the day and then i go FUCK
[20:09:13] <warrenparsons> Four if you count the space.
[20:09:21] <imsky> i don't see a reason to do it in js either Dave_Stein
[20:09:27] <imsky> seems compulsive
[20:09:29] <Dave_Stein> var x = function(){};
[20:09:32] <imsky> yeah
[20:09:34] <imsky> compulsive
[20:09:42] <imsky> x(); makes sense
[20:09:46] <imsky> {}; = lolwut
[20:09:49] <Dave_Stein> haha
[20:09:53] <Dave_Stein> its just proper is all
[20:10:00] <imsky> hmm
[20:10:26] <Dave_Stein> warrenparsons: like i said i dont care about var x; var y; at top. forcing one var per func just makes sure that a stray var doesnt end up in middle
[20:10:33] <Dave_Stein> thats main reason i enforce it
[20:10:40] <warrenparsons> Dave_Stein: I hear ya.
[20:10:54] <Dave_Stein> globals are the devils children lol
[20:11:10] <imsky> var ? = "life is good!"; ?
[20:11:16] <imsky> oh wait
[20:11:25] <imsky> ?js var ? = "life is good!"; ?
[20:11:26] <bot-t> imsky: SyntaxError: missing variable name
[20:11:44] <imsky> you screwed me for the last time unicode/japanese encoding
[20:11:58] <imsky> (????)?? ???
[20:11:59] <warrenparsons> I make sure all of our JS is namespaced on every site we build now. It helps to secure my sanity.
[20:12:31] <Dave_Stein> lol
[20:12:37] <Dave_Stein> lol @ imsky rather
[20:12:45] <Dave_Stein> everything i do is namespaced too
[20:13:02] <Dave_Stein> but a stray comma will fuck me, butttt lint will catch that for me before its too late
[20:13:12] <imsky> what is this stray comma theme
[20:13:18] <imsky> or rather meme
[20:13:20] <Dave_Stein> i just want things to be clear when looking at a function
[20:13:28] <imsky> once a week i keep reading about some bros who get screwed by a trailing comma
[20:13:29] <Dave_Stein> to know what's gonna be a var in that scope vs from above
[20:13:33] <warrenparsons> Yeah, background linting or lint-on-save is the way to go.
[20:13:36] <imsky> i neva have this problem
[20:13:47] <Dave_Stein> do you do multiple var or go with the comma route?
[20:13:53] <Dave_Stein> have you tested in IE lately? :D
[20:13:57] <abjorn> imsky: I know you wish you could do this: http://pastebin.com/NqdbiTc1
[20:14:00] <imsky> mm yeah
[20:14:22] <imsky> abjorn: i do, but then i remembered i got jopenframeworks
[20:14:31] <Dave_Stein> imsky: you still didnt answer which way you go haha
[20:14:32] <imsky> and so i can \:D/
[20:14:36] <imsky> Dave_Stein: sorry wut
[20:14:51] <imsky> abjorn: does sfml do hinting?
[20:15:03] <abjorn> hinting?
[20:15:10] <imsky> yeah is this antialiased text
[20:15:18] <imsky> apple owns patents to hinting text
[20:15:22] <imsky> which is why linux fonts suck
[20:15:31] <abjorn> wow, they would
[20:15:34] <abjorn> fuck apple
[20:15:35] <abjorn> fuck them hard
[20:15:54] <Dave_Stein> imsky: do you do var x; var y; or var x,y;
[20:16:25] <imsky> Dave_Stein: without an initial value, i use commas
[20:16:43] <Dave_Stein> but with values you do var x = a; var y = b; ?
[20:16:46] <imsky> clearly var x; var y; var z; var barbecuesauce; is tarded
[20:16:57] <imsky> exactly brother
[20:17:06] <Dave_Stein> i comma it up var x = 'a', y ='b'; all the way across the sky
[20:17:17] <imsky> yeah that's hard to read vertically
[20:17:28] <imsky> when you want to find a var def, you scan line by line
[20:17:28] <abjorn> know when they filed that patent, imsky, so I can wait for the day the patent runs out and anyone can antialias fonts and I can be all FUCK YOU APPLE?
[20:17:35] <imsky> abjorn: i can look em up
[20:17:40] <abjorn> google patents!
[20:17:52] <Dave_Stein> i just do indents so x and y line up vertically and then i scan for that one var if i need to
[20:17:52] <danzik171> whys it hard to read?  just put each declaration on a new indented line
[20:18:00] <imsky> http://freetype.sourceforge.net/patents.html
[20:18:03] <imsky> abjorn ^
[20:18:05] <Dave_Stein> brb
[20:18:12] <imsky> looks like i'm a year late with my facts
[20:18:25] <abjorn> oh cool
[20:18:33] <imsky> they were filed in 92
[20:18:37] <imsky> in case you wanna know ;)

[20:19:40] <cypha> http://pastebin.com/iKUkJcuX
[20:20:09] <imsky> abjorn: maybe it has, i see that the priority number is 1989
[20:20:10] <cypha> it's asynchronous: false
[20:20:14] <imsky> so 2009 would have been 20 years, abjorn
[20:20:23] <cypha> why would .responseText be something asynchronous according to

[20:23:27] <abjorn> its not hard to figure out, asynchronous runs in the background until its done, synchronous makes everything wait until its done

[20:24:07] <abjorn> lmfao
[20:24:12] <abjorn> that's just
[20:24:12] <imsky> nnnnnoooooo

[20:24:38] <imsky> I AM A JABOSCRIPT REPOSITORY
[20:24:43] <cypha> what're the results from?
[20:24:46] <abjorn> its okay imsky, if you actually google imsky your site is first
[20:24:54] <imsky> abjorn: actually github is first :\
[20:25:00] <abjorn> oh
[20:25:04] <abjorn> well ive visited your site so
[20:25:05] <imsky> i no rite
[20:25:08] <abjorn> thats probably why
[20:25:08] <imsky> insane demand for cssfx
[20:25:15] <cypha> abjorn, so what's responseText?
[20:25:17] <abjorn> inorite
[20:25:18] <imsky> if only i charged like 10 bucks for it
[20:25:36] <imsky> i'd be $30 richard!
[20:25:54] <abjorn> thats the text that was returned from the request, cypha
[20:26:07] <abjorn> http://whois.domaintools.com/imsky.com
[20:26:13] <cypha> abjorn, whether synchronous or asynchronous?
[20:26:23] <abjorn> so thats why you use a .com
[20:26:32] <abjorn> yeah, cypha
[20:26:35] <imsky> .co
[20:26:44] <abjorn> er
[20:26:45] <abjorn> yeah
[20:26:46] <abjorn> .co
[20:26:47] <abjorn> instead of
[20:26:48] <abjorn> .com
[20:26:48] <abjorn> shut up
[20:26:55] <imsky> i'll buy it eventually
[20:26:56] <abjorn> which reminds me
[20:26:58] <cypha> abjorn, I thought the response was found within "success"?
[20:27:00] <abjorn> i bought sofajs.com
[20:27:01] <abjorn> so
[20:27:04] <abjorn> i should probably finish it
[20:27:04] <imsky> apparently imsky means something cool in chinese/japanese
[20:27:05] <abjorn> lol
[20:27:11] <imsky> so the chinese are holding on to it
[20:27:16] <imsky> abjorn: now you have an obligation
[20:27:26] <abjorn> i know
[20:27:30] <abjorn> a $10 obligation
[20:27:41] <imsky> PLAS HOSTANG
[20:27:48] <abjorn> i already had hosting
[20:27:53] <abjorn> i just put it on my existing hosting
[20:27:59] <abjorn> addon domains bud
[20:28:01] <abjorn> addon domains
[20:28:10] <imsky> yea i kno
[20:28:13] <imsky> i use dat too
[20:28:14] <abjorn> or parked domains as others would call it, wutev
[20:28:23] <imsky> i raff i rin
[20:28:38] <abjorn> cPanel's oh "Oh, no, I'm gonna call parked domains addon domains and im gonna call aliased domains parked domains"
[20:28:50] <imsky> you got a weird cpanel
[20:28:54] <imsky> mine's just "addon domains"
[20:29:01] <abjorn> that's all cPanel
[20:29:07] <abjorn> other control panels use different terms
[20:29:22] <imsky> u ly
[20:29:32] <abjorn> not that it matters, everyone uses cpanel anyways :p
[20:29:38] <imsky> cpanel foreva
[20:29:53] <abjorn> it may be awful, but it's still better than everything else <3
[20:31:03] <cypha> abjorn, success vs responseText?
[20:31:19] <imsky> good lord
[20:31:31] <imsky> is this guy going to quiz you on the $.ajax api all day
[20:31:36] <abjorn> apparently
[20:31:42] <abjorn> success would be the callback function im assuming
[20:31:46] <abjorn> i dont know exactly what youre looking at
[20:31:46] <cypha> yeah
[20:31:52] <cypha> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:31:56] <cypha> very last example
[20:32:03] <cypha> 3rd to last too
[20:32:04] <abjorn> responseText is one of the things passed to the callback
[20:32:48] <cypha> it's outside of the whole function
[20:32:49] <abjorn> if you do async: false, ajax will return an xhr object that has the responseText and all that jazz
[20:33:00] <imsky> ?????????????
[20:33:04] <imsky> synchronously
[20:33:04] <abjorn> just like
[20:33:12] <abjorn> don't use async: false
[20:33:13] <abjorn> like
[20:33:14] <abjorn> just dont
[20:33:17] <kborchers> ever!
[20:33:19] <imsky> DO, DO
[20:33:24] <abjorn> you really
[20:33:27] <cypha> in which case, I'll never have to use .responseText?
[20:33:30] <abjorn> don't have a good reason to
[20:33:34] <abjorn> usually no
[20:33:35] <imsky> there are edge cases
[20:33:44] <Timmy> Hey guys, is there any shorthand for if(blah == 1 || blah == 2 || blah == 3) etc?
[20:34:38] <abjorn> ?learn jquery
[20:34:39] <bot-t> abjorn, jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library - http://jquery.com/
[20:34:40] <imsky> [1,2,3].indexOf(blah)!==-1
[20:34:44] <abjorn> okay that didnt work
[20:34:48] <imsky> lawl
[20:34:51] <cypha> abjorn, can you show me where .ajaxError() and .preventDefault would fit in over here? https://gist.github.com/2ab122d6de5adadfe15a
[20:35:07] <cypha> omg, u just hit me with the rtfm?
[20:35:13] <abjorn> basically
[20:35:16] <cypha> I'm reading the manual
[20:35:21] <cypha> I'm asking you questions about the manual
[20:35:21] <abjorn> read a tutorial then
[20:35:22] <imsky> timmy i showed you the light
[20:35:25] <imsky> of indexof
[20:35:29] <imsky> which doesn't work in internet explorer
[20:35:32] <imsky> unless you use a shim
[20:35:53] <Timmy> indexof doesn't work in IE?
[20:35:57] <imsky> microsoft should just root all of its browsers and forcibly update them
[20:36:00] <abjorn> http://jqfundamentals.com/
[20:36:04] <abjorn> really good guide to jq
[20:36:07] <imsky> not on arrays, you need to add the functionality
[20:36:21] <cypha> ok, I'm really really good at learning by example
[20:36:31] <imsky> of coarse yuo aer
[20:36:46] <abjorn> if you can't learn by example I can't teach you
[20:36:47] <abjorn> lol
[20:36:48] <cypha> can I see how you would integrate .preventDefault and .ajaxError()?
[20:36:57] <abjorn> you
[20:36:58] <cypha> https://gist.github.com/2ab122d6de5adadfe15a
[20:36:58] <abjorn> wouldn't?
[20:37:02] <ericlewis> is there a way to disable scrolling altogether via jQuery/js?
[20:37:05] <abjorn> preventDefault is for event callbacks
[20:37:11] <cypha> right, I know what they do
[20:37:18] <abjorn> like, DOM events
[20:37:19] <cypha> just wanna see how you would implement them into that little script
[20:37:21] <Timmy> well i should've given a better example, the numbers will be keypress codes, so not 1,2,3 more like 18,23,31, so on
[20:37:59] <imsky> how are keypress codes not numbers
[20:38:11] <Timmy> they are of course
[20:38:11] <danzik17> Timmy: Is there a logical grouping here?  "Arrow keys", "MetaKeys", etc...
[20:38:19] <Timmy> no it's totally random actually
[20:38:32] <Timmy> well not random, but not logical
[20:38:37] <imsky> you can't detect meta key with jaboscript
[20:38:38] <danzik17> then screw what i was about to say.   you can use a regex, but dunno if it'd be faster.
[20:38:38] <ericlewis> imsky: you can just parseInt()
[20:38:38] <Timmy> i know which i have to single out
[20:38:39] <imsky> CAN YOU
[20:39:01] <danzik17> imsky: ......yes?  =P
[20:39:09] <imsky> oh jaboscript
[20:39:11] <ericlewis> lol sorry came in late on that conversation
[20:39:14] <imsky> your power knows no bounds
[20:39:34] <ericlewis> anyone know about disabling scroll controls via jq/js?
[20:40:11] <danzik17> ericlewis: You can try preventDefault in an event handler.  That's gonna piss off your users though imo.
[20:40:20] <ericlewis> it's with reason
[20:40:25] <imsky> nope
[20:40:27] <Timmy> ok literally this is what i'm doing if(e.which == 13 || e.which == 21 || e.which == 42) do some sh*t
[20:40:28] <imsky> it's not
[20:40:32] <abjorn> you can listen for the scroll event, ericlewis, then continually scroll to the place you want the page at
[20:40:37] <ericlewis> it's not what, psosible?
[20:40:45] <imsky> Timmy: [13,21,42].indexOf(e.which)!==-1
[20:40:53] <ericlewis> abjorn: i was trying that but it's not smooth enough behavior
[20:41:04] <abjorn> you're probably not going to get a smooth enough behavior
[20:41:18] <abjorn> without
[20:41:25] <abjorn> overflow: hidden;
[20:41:26] <Timmy> imsky: i don't doubt that works, i just don't understand it at all
[20:41:35] <imsky> you don't understand indexOf?
[20:41:43] <Timmy> i don't understand the not equals -1
[20:41:46] <imsky> ?js [1,2,3].indexOf(1)
[20:41:46] <bot-t> imsky: 0
[20:41:50] <imsky> ?js [1,2,3].indexOf(8)
[20:41:50] <bot-t> imsky: -1
[20:41:54] <imsky> get it now?
[20:41:56] <cypha> abjorn?
[20:42:00] <abjorn> ?
[20:42:04] <ericlewis> i have overflow: hidden up, but i have this wide div of images…kind of hard to describe but trying to make a side scrolling website that looks like a videogame
[20:42:04] <cypha> thought u were myagi'ing
[20:42:05] <cypha> :)
[20:42:19] <abjorn> im not asian though
[20:42:23] <cypha> can I see how you would integrate .preventDefault and .ajaxError()?
[20:42:26] <cypha> https://gist.github.com/2ab122d6de5adadfe15a
[20:42:28] <imsky> lololol
[20:42:29] <huntedmitch> Hey guys. If I have 4 divs with the same class, what is the easies way to fade in the first, fade out, fade in the second, fade out etc. etc. in sequence?
[20:42:30] <Timmy> i think because it won't ever be -1?
[20:42:33] <imsky> plz help with my websights
[20:42:39] <imsky> Timmy: what's array[-1]?
[20:42:39] <abjorn> .ajaxError(function () {
[20:42:40] <abjorn>    event.preventDefault();
[20:42:42] <abjorn> etc etc
[20:42:55] <cypha> abjorn, I see their examples
[20:42:56] <imsky> ?js [1,2,3][-1]
[20:42:56] <bot-t> imsky: undefined
[20:42:56] <abjorn> this is assuming

[20:42:59] <imsky> ?js [1,2,3][0]
[20:43:00] <bot-t> imsky: 1
[20:43:01] <cypha> i just wanna see how it would fit into https://gist.github.com/2ab122d6de5adadfe15a
[20:43:03] <abjorn> but
[20:43:04] <abjorn> BUT
[20:43:07] <abjorn> that's not going to work
[20:43:15] <abjorn> because the function will have already returned
[20:43:15] <Timmy> OH
[20:43:15] <imsky> because event is not defined
[20:43:23] <abjorn> by the time the ajax request has finished
[20:43:27] <abjorn> unless you did async: false;
[20:43:27] <abjorn> which
[20:43:28] <cypha> oops, I'm taking out return false, as you suggested before
[20:43:29] <abjorn> you shouldn't
[20:43:34] <Timmy> array -1 is nothing
[20:43:35] <imsky> ROROROROROROROR
[20:43:39] <Timmy> CORRECT?
[20:43:42] <imsky> it's undefined
[20:43:47] <cypha> why would async: false have to be?
[20:43:51] <imsky> lol
[20:43:53] <Timmy> gimme praiz
[20:43:56] <abjorn> basically, cypha, if you want to to not submit when it fails then make it not submit at all
[20:43:56] <crankharder> so the callback for fadeOut executes once for each element in the matched set... how can I make it execute one time?
[20:43:57] <imsky> abjorn: plz fix my websights
[20:44:04] <abjorn> manually make it submit on success
[20:44:13] <cypha> abjorn, ohhh, i see what you're saying
[20:44:17] <cypha> abjorn, i wasn't asking that
[20:44:22] <cypha> but I see why you thought I was
[20:44:27] <ericlewis> danzik17: would i do a preventDefault on $(document).keydown( function(event) ?
[20:44:32] <cypha> I just meant in general for to prevent a submission at all
[20:44:33] <abjorn> wasn't asking what?
[20:44:34] <ericlewis> to disable scrolling
[20:44:42] <abjorn> yeah
[20:44:43] <abjorn> just like
[20:44:45] <abjorn> return false;
[20:44:53] <cypha> and if the login/password were incorrect, I want to know how to handle that (using ajaxError)
[20:45:10] <abjorn> or you could just not use a form and just make a <input type="button">
[20:45:12] <cypha> so the two methods have nothing to do with each other
[20:45:19] <abjorn> there's a lot of ways to do it
[20:45:24] <ngharo> cypha: ajaxError is for when the webserver throws a 500 error iirc
[20:45:52] <abjorn> ngharo: should happen for anything that's not a 200/301/302 I'm pretty sure
[20:46:09] <danzik17> ericlewis: Probably $(window).scroll
[20:46:09] <abjorn> basically anything where the server doesn't go "hey fuck you, there's nothing here for you to see"
[20:46:41] <imsky> MY WEBSIGHTS
[20:46:48] <cypha> ngharo, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/#comment-94100573
[20:47:02] <ericlewis> danzik17: worked great! thanks.
[20:47:24] <abjorn> sir plz my websights
[20:47:27] <cypha> abjorn, so can I see how you would put ajaxError and preventDefault into that script please?
[20:47:48] <cypha> ajaxError in case the server decides the username/pasword were incorrect
[20:47:58] <cypha> and preventDefault to prevent the submit buttons default action
[20:48:11] <cypha> https://gist.github.com/2ab122d6de5adadfe15a
[20:48:16] <cypha> if you don't mind
[20:49:15] <abjorn> https://gist.github.com/c458301defc1e34e7574
[20:49:16] <abjorn> In this case you don't really ever need to have it submit. You're going to want to always preventDefault().
[20:49:27] <abjorn> for ajax auth
[20:49:44] <abjorn> the form is just there as a fallback if no js
[20:50:14] <Timmy> imsky: thanks a lot, worked great
[20:50:31] <cypha> abjorn, k
[20:50:38] <imsky> timmy you're welcome
[20:50:52] <abjorn> cypha: you understand why?
[20:50:53] <cypha> and whta about ajaxError (in case the server gets an incorrect un/pw)?
[20:51:06] <cypha> abjorn, why I don't actually want it to submit?
[20:51:12] <cypha> using the html?
[20:51:17] <cypha> because the page would refresh
[20:53:13] <AliG100> I'm trying to find a nice jQuery photo uploader - has anyone used one they can recommend?
[20:54:00] <abjorn> cypha: https://gist.github.com/c458301defc1e34e7574

[20:59:01] <abjorn> I
[20:59:04] <abjorn> think I'm gonna pass
[20:59:05] <abjorn> on that one

[20:59:41] <binaryfus10nz> anyone used $.ajax?
[20:59:44] <abjorn> or just paul irish
[20:59:51] <imsky> no like a superhero
[20:59:55] <imsky> of standards

[21:00:38] <binaryfus10nz> http://i.expression.microsoft.com/dd421883.WebSP1_fig01%28en-us,MSDN.10%29.jpg
[21:00:41] <abjorn> I could try dressing up as a hipster
[21:00:50] <imsky> you would _be_ a hipster then
[21:00:53] <imsky> by commutativity
[21:01:01] <abjorn> nooooooo!
[21:01:31] <abjorn> could wear big rimmed glasses with no lenses, carry around a can of PBR, and have a pack of american spirits on me at all times
[21:02:28] <imsky> i dunno, a hipster isn't very original
[21:02:33] <imsky> maybe you could go as a css3 transition
[21:02:55] <imsky> master the art of the backspin
[21:03:02] <abjorn> lol
[21:03:08] <abjorn> keep in mind
[21:03:09] <abjorn> these people
[21:03:11] <cypha> abjorn, so basically I never need the 3rd argument of $.post if I use .success ?
[21:03:12] <abjorn> aren't huge web devs
[21:03:17] <abjorn> they're sysadmins and tech support
[21:03:19] <imsky> ok go as kim kardashian
[21:03:30] <abjorn> more or less cypha
[21:03:30] <cypha> oh nm
[21:03:43] <cypha> abjorn, how does it know what "data" is?
[21:03:56] <imsky> http://www.dailystab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kim-kardashian-complex-4.jpg abjorn i know you can pull this off
[21:04:08] <abjorn> cause..it's passed...to the callback function
[21:04:09] <abjorn> ._.
[21:04:15] <abjorn> ew
[21:04:16] <abjorn> no
[21:04:16] <imsky> actually you know what
[21:04:18] <abjorn> @imsky
[21:04:27] <imsky> just hire kim and then piggyback on her, so when she turns around
[21:04:33] <imsky> you're kim kardashian's hump midget
[21:05:33] <AliG100> can anyone recommend a PHP script that uploads images and that uses jQuery
[21:05:44] <Hierofant> Armenians don't have the best legs
[21:05:57] <Hierofant> hot faces, strong personas tho
[21:06:29] <abjorn> I could dress up as post-marriage Link, fat, lazy, beer in hand, yelling at Zelda to make him a sandwich and when she talks back say "I FUCKING SAVED YOU FROM GANON HOW MANY TIMES?"
[21:06:29] <imsky> hello hierofant welcome to our conversation
[21:06:50] <imsky> kardashian hump midget...deadbeat link
[21:07:07] <abjorn> to be fair, zelda does owe him a lifetime of sandwiches and sex
[21:07:12] <imsky> tbh i have no idea about the nerd subculture
[21:07:24] <imsky> like zelda memes and katamari damacy mean nothing to me
[21:07:29] <abjorn> you're a web dev
[21:07:31] <abjorn> a nerd
[21:07:37] <abjorn> the second coolest type of nerd, but a nerd
[21:07:39] <imsky> eh, old school
[21:07:46] <abjorn> the first is designers
[21:07:52] <abjorn> but they hardly count as nerds
[21:07:55] <abjorn> and some don't count at all
[21:08:06] <abjorn> graphic designers do, fashion designers do not
[21:08:18] <imsky> yeah see
[21:08:23] <imsky> nerds care about who are nerds
[21:08:25] <imsky> i don't give a shit
[21:08:31] <coldhead> what are you people going on about
[21:08:34] <abjorn> no
[21:08:35] <abjorn> just me
[21:08:36] <abjorn> only I care
[21:08:44] <abjorn> coldhead welcome to the party
[21:08:46] <abjorn> where you been?
[21:08:49] <abjorn> learning jquery?
[21:08:55] <coldhead> lol not yet
[21:08:59] <coldhead> i have to learn CSS first
[21:09:04] <coldhead> i am trying to learn in order
[21:09:05] <abjorn> you really should, I hear its great
[21:09:07] <coldhead> CSS2 first
[21:09:12] <coldhead> then 2.1
[21:09:18] <abjorn> then css 3?
[21:09:19] <imsky> abjorn: actually i reject "nerd," because i don't really go with the subculture
[21:09:22] <coldhead> if there's time
[21:09:30] <abjorn> neither do I, I'm just bored
[21:09:32] <abjorn> @imsky
[21:09:40] <abjorn> I'm a lot of things, therefore I'm none of those things
[21:09:41] <imsky> thinking about it, these words have specific meanings
[21:09:43] <coldhead> there's a nerd subculture?
[21:09:49] <imsky> hello coldhead
[21:09:50] <coldhead> all kinds of people like ghostbusters
[21:09:54] <imsky> welcome to western civilization
[21:10:04] <randomize> hi

[21:10:34] <randomize> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[21:10:35] <Hierofant> hi imsky :)  howsit goin
[21:10:44] <randomize> I want to get the vote.php via GET request
[21:10:54] <imsky> lol abjorn
[21:10:57] <imsky> hi Hierofant
[21:11:01] <Hierofant> I'm a designer
[21:11:04] <Hierofant> supercool nerd!
[21:11:06] <abjorn> NEEERD
[21:11:11] <Hierofant> woop w00p
[21:11:12] <imsky> i actually am a designer...
[21:11:21] <abjorn> yeah but jaboscripter first
[21:11:27] <imsky> not to break your heart
[21:11:29] <abjorn> i think
[21:11:31] <imsky> but jaboscripter only recently
[21:11:31] <abjorn> i dont really know
[21:11:34] * Hierofant does a dance across the floor, spins, etc
[21:11:35] <abjorn> i have no clue, actually
[21:11:35] <imsky> in the last 2 years
[21:11:42] <abjorn> me2 actually
[21:11:46] <randomize> and I want to get params like vote.php?vote=up&filename=image.jpg <- and this will add up/down voting count to the sql table
[21:11:47] <abjorn> well, okay, more like 3 years
[21:11:48] <randomize> is this a ok way?
[21:11:49] <imsky> 3, now that i think about it
[21:11:54] <imsky> oh man legit mates
[21:11:56] <abjorn> STOP COMPETING WITH ME
[21:11:57] <abjorn> oh
[21:11:58] <abjorn> yeah
[21:12:01] <abjorn> bros
[21:12:04] <abjorn> bromistry
[21:12:06] <imsky> lol
[21:12:08] <randomize> basically I want ot use jquery to post via ajax for vote up/down a item on a page
[21:12:13] <randomize> is there any advice?
[21:12:14] <imsky> yeah i've been doing all kinds of shit for a while now
[21:12:17] <abjorn> randomize: sounds fine to me
[21:12:29] <randomize> abjorn: so .get or .ajax
[21:12:31] <randomize> ?
[21:12:34] <abjorn> either or
[21:12:37] <abjorn> doesn't matter
[21:12:42] <randomize> ok
[21:12:43] <abjorn> $.get is shorter
[21:12:47] <randomize> let me see
[21:13:05] <abjorn> honestly I kinda just always use $.ajax out of habit
[21:13:59] <imsky> i use nothing because i have an enormous framework doing everything for me
[21:14:22] <abjorn> lol you just press a button
[21:14:24] <randomize> I have thumbnails in a gallery. 6 thumbs on a page. I have created a <a href="#">+</a> and the - fo rvoting up and down. should I make this into a .post and post to the php file or should I fetch a get request and pass params? what's better safer? Also, my php file will then return the total # of votes, and I'd like to use jquery to change that dynamically on the page upon +/- click
[21:14:24] <abjorn> and bam
[21:14:25] <abjorn> done
[21:14:41] <randomize> what's more secure?
[21:14:48] <randomize> does it matter even?
[21:15:00] <imsky> abjorn: srsly tho. the more i work on it, the easier huge changes become
[21:15:05] <imsky> it's like "now make it into a bank app"
[21:15:07] <abjorn> well a post passing params is like
[21:15:10] <abjorn> kind of safer but not really
[21:15:10] <imsky> "ok hold on let me change some json"
[21:15:28] <abjorn> in the case of an ajax, is someone is listening into your packets, they're gonna see the params either way
[21:15:35] <randomize> ok
[21:15:36] <objNoob> whats that discovery channel show where they group some people together, and they try to survive through a mocked world disaster
[21:15:56] <imsky> MAN IN THE MIDDLE
[21:16:04] <objNoob> I don't think so.
[21:16:08] <imsky> not the show, just commenting on abjorn's crap
[21:16:09] <cypha> abjorn, btw, I can just take out "return false" over here https://gist.github.com/c458301defc1e34e7574
[21:16:15] <objNoob> oh, lol
[21:16:19] <abjorn> I know cypha
[21:17:05] <imsky> abjorn: so since you restarted proto, i'm assuming you figured out how to compile v8 on windows
[21:17:06] <cypha> abjorn, sorry, I meant to put a quesiton mark
[21:17:14] <objNoob> It's called The Colony!
[21:17:41] <abjorn> yep imsky
[21:17:48] <imsky> abjorn: you learn anything new?
[21:17:55] <abjorn> well I didn't figure it out, they pushed an update that fixed it
[21:18:01] <imsky> trololol
[21:18:06] <abjorn> so yeah
[21:18:08] <abjorn> either or
[21:18:15] <abjorn> it works thats whats important
[21:18:17] <imsky> saved by teh googlez
[21:20:08] <imsky> oh man i got frozen bananas dipped in chocolate
[21:21:01] <objNoob> I had carrots and ranch dipping.
[21:21:26] <imsky> yes, yes
[21:21:32] <imsky> but who can brag
[21:23:08] <abjorn> lol imsky
[21:23:10] <abjorn> our CEO
[21:23:12] <abjorn> makes my laugh
[21:23:18] <abjorn> actually i guess he's the owner, but still
[21:23:19] <abjorn> http://blog.hostgator.com/2011/09/30/dear-mr-oxley/
[21:23:23] <abjorn> he's basically lol
[21:23:27] <abjorn> "lol look at these dummies"
[21:23:31] <dogarrhea2> why does making something draggable cause my element to jump away
[21:23:33] <abjorn> *basically like
[21:24:47] <abjorn> http://blog.hostgator.com/media/ranting_lady.mp3
[21:24:47] <abjorn> I'm laughing so hard
[21:25:30] <imsky> hold on lemme read
[21:25:47] <objNoob> window media cannot play
[21:27:19] <seivan> This is probably more suitable..
[21:27:24] <seivan> Using twitters boostrap javascript library, using stuff like popover() does not really work on dynamically added elements. Any thoughts on how to work around it? I call $(".myClass").popover() each time we add a new element and yet only the old ones get it, not the new ones
[21:27:33] <dogarrhea2> $(this.parentDiv).css({left: x + "px", top: y + "px" }).show();  <------ element appears where I click it where x and y are e.pageX and e.pageY respecitively.  Adding 	 $(this.parentDiv).draggable(); after that causes things to show up in random places
[21:27:34] <imsky> abjorn: holy shit that mp3
[21:27:44] <abjorn> I know rofl
[21:27:48] <abjorn> they cut it off
[21:27:54] <abjorn> man you should hear some of the shit we get in there
[21:27:59] <imsky> there's no concurrency
[21:28:03] <abjorn> I know, wtf
[21:28:04] <imsky> is she talking about jaboscript
[21:28:30] <abjorn> "by the way one is not a proportion its not a number its not even fucking english. theres no concurrency" what the FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
[21:29:49] <imsky> they can turn themselves in of their own free will through force
[21:29:50] <imsky> wat
[21:30:20] <abjorn> she must've been on meth or something
[21:30:25] <imsky> don't doubt it
[21:30:25] <abjorn> idk what it was but it sounds like meth
[21:30:28] <imsky> cool words though
[21:30:29] <imsky> concurrency
[21:30:30] <abjorn> dont ask why i know that
[21:30:47] <abjorn> yeah white trash on meth throw out big words they dont understand
[21:30:59] <abjorn> well, so do all high people, but especially meth heads

[21:32:12] <abjorn> oh hie cook1es
[21:32:14] <imsky> ganjolicious
[21:32:16] <abjorn> lol
[21:32:25] <cook1es> abjorn: ?
[21:32:29] <abjorn> yes, this is #jquery, cook1es, not #pot
[21:32:36] * imsky eating a choco banana on a stick
[21:32:37] <abjorn> sorry, ##pot
[21:32:40] <objNoob> LOL
[21:32:49] <abjorn> lol imsky what
[21:32:53] <seivan> Anyone familiar with the bootstrap twitter library? Using $(".my_class").popover() on dynamically added elemenets won't cut it. With regular jQuery I would usually use live instead of bind any thoughts?
[21:32:56] <imsky> i told you
[21:33:02] <coldhead> that poor woman
[21:33:03] <abjorn> STOP STALKING MY TWITTER
[21:33:03] <imsky> i got a frozen banana dipped in chocolate
[21:33:05] <imsky> eating it now
[21:33:09] <objNoob> he didn't mean hie cookies.. he meant thi cookies :P
[21:33:12] <abjorn> coldhead: why?
[21:33:38] <cook1es> abjorn: troll, get the fuck out, this is not #randomConversationsForLonelyPeople.
[21:33:47] <abjorn> yes it is
[21:33:53] <abjorn> you act like you've never been in #jquery before
[21:34:00] <abjorn> just like coldhead
[21:34:17] <imsky> #jquery is random for about 75% of the day
[21:34:46] <abjorn> well
[21:34:47] <abjorn> 60%
[21:34:51] <abjorn> then 30% inactive entirely
[21:34:55] <abjorn> then 10% on topic
[21:35:03] <imsky> and then cook1es comes in
[21:35:09] <imsky> he's the 1% extra
[21:35:10] <seivan> Hmm any thoughts on how to prepend elements and have handlers bind themselves to the new dynamically added elements?
[21:35:27] <imsky> ?delegate @ seivan
[21:35:27] <bot-t> seivan, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[21:35:31] <abjorn> also .live
[21:35:37] <imsky> .live is cancerous
[21:35:39] <seivan> Yeah
[21:35:40] <kborchers> no, don't use .live
[21:35:41] <abjorn> you're cancerous
[21:35:46] <imsky> no way bro
[21:35:49] <seivan> But this is working with a new library
[21:35:51] <abjorn> I THOUGHT I'D AT LEAST SAY IT'S THERE
[21:35:53] <seivan> that uses jQery
[21:35:56] <imsky> abjorn: <3
[21:35:58] <seivan> the internal impklementation of popover() does not use bind
[21:36:01] <seivan> I mean Live*
[21:36:07] <imsky> holy shit what
[21:36:20] <kborchers> mmm, popovers
[21:36:49] <seivan> $('<li><a href="#" class="popover-activity" "rel"="popover" "data-title"="Please sign in">Five in</a></li>').prependTo("#activities").slideDown("slow")
[21:36:50] <objNoob> "Maybe some families. Couples. Fake babies that cry. Multiple colonies. "
[21:36:52] <abjorn> wait what
[21:37:00] <objNoob> "I don't like the fake babies idea for two reasons. First since it's not a real baby you don't have a true attachment to the fake baby hence it would be expendable. Second I could see someone breaking it open to try to get the batteries out for a flashlight or something."
[21:37:01] <imsky> yeah dude
[21:37:03] <imsky> i'm lost
[21:37:11] <abjorn> fake babies what
[21:37:17] <objNoob> LOL
[21:37:23] <abjorn> the fuck am I reading
[21:37:26] <abjorn> .jpg
[21:37:53] <objNoob> fake babies, are born to meth heads
[21:38:06] <objNoob> they are expendible
[21:38:14] <abjorn> there is no concurrency
[21:38:20] <objNoob> HAHA
[21:38:49] <cypha> abjorn, http://api.jquery.com/tmpl , in "Using Remote Data", success: showMovies is the callback...so what is showMovies(data) then?
[21:39:19] <imsky> lol there is no concurrency
[21:39:25] <cypha> function showMovies(data)
[21:40:03] <cypha> is "data" a builtin variable?
[21:40:20] <abjorn> there's no concurrency guys
[21:40:23] <abjorn> no concurrency
[21:40:27] <abjorn> one is not a proportion
[21:40:29] <cypha> and wouldn't showMovies() have to be defined before using it in success: ?
[21:40:31] <abjorn> its not a number
[21:40:34] <imsky> it's not even a number
[21:40:34] <abjorn> its not even fucking english
[21:40:38] <imsky> o wait
[21:40:48] <imsky> dude
[21:40:51] <imsky> that's what you should go as
[21:40:54] <imsky> for halloween
[21:40:59] <abjorn> a meth addict?
[21:41:02] <imsky> yeah
[21:41:03] <abjorn> or the number 1?
[21:41:07] <abjorn> or concurrency
[21:41:09] <imsky> no that's not even english
[21:41:12] <abjorn> I should go as concurrency
[21:41:23] <abjorn> to fill the lack of it
[21:41:24] <imsky> concurrent meth addict
[21:41:34] <abjorn> multiple meth pipes at once
[21:43:22] <dogarrhea2> why is draggable so fundamentally broken :(
[21:43:37] <dogarrhea2> it jitters around in a non continuous manner and messes up css
[21:43:55] <abjorn> what browser
[21:43:59] <abjorn> NO IMSKY LEFT
[21:44:22] <imsky> abjorn: there is no concurrency
[21:44:25] <imsky> also i'm out for the night
[21:44:29] <abjorn> oh thank god you're back
[21:44:29] <imsky> lata playa
[21:44:30] <abjorn> oh okay
[21:44:33] <abjorn> im out then too
[21:44:37] <imsky> haha peace
[21:44:37] <abjorn> fuck this channel without imsky
[21:44:41] <imsky> word up
[21:44:42] <abjorn> later
[21:44:46] <abjorn> actually i just need to go to bed
[21:44:48] <abjorn> but yeah night
[21:46:28] <cremaster> is it possible to pass arguments to event functions like $('#button').click(arg1)
[21:46:52] <vyshay> nice nick
[21:49:59] <objNoob> shit
[21:50:11] <objNoob> i cant download flash 11.0.1.152
[21:50:25] <objNoob> I hate websites that don't work.
[21:50:49] <objNoob> Expecially for a company like Adobe
[21:53:29] <new2net> *sigh*... for some reason my page is reloading. I just don't see any reason for it to. Are there any debugging tools for javascript (possibly a firefox plugin to view the stack)?
[21:53:59] <dogarrhea2> why does css() change my position from absolute to auto?
[21:55:41] <cremaster> new2net, firebug?
[21:55:48] <dogarrhea2> I have a this.parentDiv = $('<div class="absolutelypositionedclass"></div>'); and $(this.parentDiv).css(top: 20+"px", left: 20+"px") changes it to auto..
[21:56:46] * ambidextrousTx is getting started with JavaScript and jQuery
[21:56:54] <new2net> cremaster, that might help if my issue was an error/warning. But it's not a problem with firefox. The thing is, I can trace the code by hand (there's not a lot of it), and it all executes just fine. Then for some reason the page submits (not reload).
[21:58:23] <dogarrhea2> that is really aggravating not knowing why css() just decides to throw away the absolutely positioned css property and override it with auto..
[21:58:33] <dogarrhea2> in fact, /auto in vim turns up nothing
[22:06:09] <cypha> in the section titled "Using Remote Data", how is success: showMovies used before defining the function showMovies? http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[22:07:01] <dogarrhea2> has anyone experience css() reseting/overriding default css without explicitly putting them in the map?
[22:09:33] <dogarrhea2> o well. guess this is another "unknown" bug
[22:11:00] <dogarrhea2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1559496/ie8-css-absolute-positioning-random-bug  oh god this is ugly
[22:11:49] <dogarrhea2> or maybe it's draggable doing it i don't know
[22:11:51] <dogarrhea2> worked before.
[22:13:16] <objNoob> Nice Ride
[22:13:31] <objNoob> Yay
[22:13:38] * objNoob is ready for round two!
[22:14:22] <objNoob> Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
[22:14:57] <cypha> i need to start hiding this netsplit crap
[22:16:03] <oojacoboo> hey guys, I have a data- DOM html attr that I am trying to add ++ on an event, how might I go about this?
[22:16:42] <oojacoboo> I'm thinking soething like… $('#thisElement').data('attrName').Math(); ?
[22:16:50] <oojacoboo> any ideas on this one?
[22:17:11] <new2net> cremaster, it was because I had <button></button> instead of <input type="button" /> and I guess there's a difference...?
[22:17:22] <dogarrhea2> is there something inherently wrong with creating an element by doing this: $('<div></div>') ??
[22:18:13] <cremaster> new2net, interesting
[22:18:33] <sat2050> @dogarrhea2 read jquery manual
[22:18:48] <dogarrhea2> cool a useful answer. maybe u can be more helpful
[22:18:54] <new2net> cremaster: I think firefox just figured <button> by default means submit?
[22:20:04] <new2net> dogarrhea2:  $( 'x' ) is a selector... and  <  > are not valid ... maybe you meant $( "div" )
[22:21:22] <dogarrhea2> new2net the jquery manual seems to think passing html to it is ok
[22:21:35] <dogarrhea2> If a string is passed as the parameter to $(), jQuery examines the string to see if it looks like HTML (i.e., it has <tag ... > somewhere within the string).
[22:22:38] <dogarrhea2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327047/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-create-html-elements-using-jquery seems to say that you can also use $('<div></div>') to create an element..
[22:22:43] <dogarrhea2> there are a few ways in fcat
[22:26:49] <dogarrhea2> i wonder why this library is letting you do 5-6 different ways of creating an element
[22:26:57] <dogarrhea2> i thought it was supposed to eliminate this problem
[22:27:05] <cook1es> Can someone explain why row 13 returns values but not row 49 in http://pastebin.com/w69L5dvN ? Thanks all.
[22:27:08] <dogarrhea2> inner html.. document.createelementById etc
[22:28:00] <cypha> what's wrong with this script? It's apparently got some invalid syntax https://gist.github.com/ed4c3e823219faefa246
[22:29:21] <ajpiano> cook1es: probably because of see ?forloopscope
[22:29:21] <bot-t> cook1es, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/binding-event-to-element-dynamically#14737000000958061
[22:29:24] <dogarrhea2> eh. i'll wait till tomorrow
[22:29:30] <dogarrhea2> spinning on open source software is a waste of time
[22:29:42] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: what is your question?
[22:29:55] <ajpiano> doing $("<div>")  is perfectly valid
[22:29:58] <ajpiano> as is any string of html
[22:30:06] <coldhead> >_<
[22:30:12] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[22:30:23] <dogarrhea2> ajpiano: it appears that the classes are not applied
[22:30:27] <cook1es> ajpiano: but the userName is defined inside the for loop, I don't understand.
[22:31:08] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: i assure you that absent some other error, classes are applied to elements created that way
[22:31:24] <dogarrhea2> i have a class .placeholder{position:absolute}
[22:32:17] <dogarrhea2> i do a var e = $("<div class='placeholder'></div>"); alert($(e).css("position"))   output is "relative" if i have a draggable or "static" if nothing is there
[22:33:02] <ajpiano> cook1es: i was sort of just guessing there, it might not be the for loop thing
[22:33:16] <ajpiano> it could be something to do with the global variables
[22:33:26] <ajpiano> that each iteration of the loop clobbers the variables
[22:33:31] <ajpiano> and all that persists is the last value
[22:34:50] <cook1es> ajpiano: I don't understand what you mean, no value is returned at all inside the click( function()
[22:35:11] <ajpiano> console logging and returning things are completley different concepts to begin with
[22:35:59] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: it might have to be inserted into the DOM first
[22:36:03] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/5FK5w/
[22:36:22] <cook1es> ajpiano: alert() returns the same thing, null, length: null
[22:36:33] <ajpiano> right of course it does
[22:36:39] <ajpiano> i'm just saying... those aren't "returning" anything
[22:36:51] <ajpiano> yeah dude
[22:36:55] <ajpiano> you just have one global variable
[22:37:03] <ajpiano> userNameComtainer etc
[22:37:14] <ajpiano> and so every time ANY ONE of the elemnets is clicked
[22:37:30] <ajpiano> it usesthe last value of i and the global container...
[22:37:31] <ajpiano> i think.
[22:39:04] <dogarrhea2> i'm getting errors on your jsfiddle ajpiano
[22:39:08] <cook1es> so for() is not run and pushes click eventlisteners to DOM and then when user clicks it returns that for scope?
[22:39:10] <dogarrhea2> object doesn't support blah blah blah
[22:39:27] <ajpiano> cook1es: you really need to use local variables
[22:39:40] <cook1es> ajpiano: how
[22:39:40] <ajpiano> every single variable you're using is global
[22:39:44] <ajpiano> use var
[22:39:48] <ajpiano> otherwise variables are local
[22:40:01] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: works fine over here...
[22:40:24] <cook1es> ajpiano: changed to var, didn't fix it
[22:40:31] <ajpiano> i doubted that it would
[22:40:41] <dogarrhea2> i'm using ie8
[22:40:50] <ajpiano> there's so much going on in this code that for me to identify it in 2 seconds just by glancing at it at 1:40 am is pretty slim
[22:41:11] <ajpiano> i gave you a couple things to go off of though :/
[22:41:42] <dogarrhea2> http://pastebin.com/vtMLzwJa  <--- here in a complete working example where u juts copy the contents into a html file, it prints undefined.
[22:41:47] <dogarrhea2> ie8
[22:42:25] <dogarrhea2> i would really hate to use some onDomAdd event..
[22:42:51] <ajpiano> i think you have to like, wait for document ready...
[22:42:54] <dogarrhea2> but if that is the problem then..
[22:42:55] <ajpiano> before you add thigns to the body..
[22:42:56] <cook1es> ajpiano: I'd be happy if you'd do more than glancing at it then, 2 seconds of everyones effort will probably do nothing ;)
[22:43:17] <ajpiano> cook1es: i can't right now, sorry
[22:43:52] <ajpiano> but seriously bro, SO many global variables.. bound to get you in trouble
[22:44:21] * cook1es facepalms.
[22:45:41] <coldhead> ajpiano: you should fix people's problems instead of giving general advice
[22:45:41] <dogarrhea2> ugh  i don't like where this is going.
[22:45:54] <dogarrhea2> my code is gonna get ugly
[22:45:58] <coldhead> if i want general advice i'll read the old testament thank you very much
[22:46:03] <dogarrhea2> if i can't encapsulate draggable inside a constructor function
[22:46:11] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: waiting for the body of the document to exist before appending to it is not some crazy thing
[22:46:22] <dogarrhea2> in the real code it's doing that.
[22:46:32] <dogarrhea2> everything is done after document.ready..
[22:46:33] <ajpiano> ok
[22:46:56] <dogarrhea2> i think there's some time before u $('<div></div>') and appendto
[22:46:58] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: ps i got no error in ie8 with that fiddle
[22:47:03] <ajpiano> it did say sattic and then absolute
[22:47:19] <ajpiano> but anyway, i have to run, best of luckl
[22:48:16] <Bage> I am very new to jquery and started learning recently. I have one question. I have this fixed bottom toolbar in my website. The bottom is 0. But i wish to change the bottom to 30px when someone scrolls to bottom.
[22:48:52] <ExpFist> Hmm
[22:48:55] <Bage> Or, it will be even better, if it change it's bottom position when it meets another div element in the bottom
[22:49:04] <ExpFist> Does anyone know why HTML5 Audio wouldn't work properly in Safari?
[22:49:18] <ExpFist> It says it supports it when asked via JS, but when attempting to load a file it never loads it
[22:51:31] <dogarrhea2> all i can say is that .draggable changes the div to be relative.
[22:51:45] <dogarrhea2> seems obnoxious
[22:52:02] <cook1es> Bage: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/whenScrollBottom
[22:52:36] <Bage> cook1es, awesome. I will check it.
[22:53:27] <Bage> that is exactly i was looking. Thanks
[22:55:07] <dogarrhea2>          alert($(this.parentDiv).css("position"));    $(this.parentDiv).draggable();   alert($(this.parentDiv).css("position"));  hrm.. it now alerts "static" then "relative"
[22:55:20] <dogarrhea2> maybe someone can add this to the manual that it screws up absolute positioning
[22:56:53] <dogarrhea2> hrm. so it's either put all my stop and start draggable code outside of the constructor function or do css("position" : "absolute") right after draggable. which is less evil
[22:57:11] <dogarrhea2> i'm still very annoyed by this behavior
[22:57:14] <cook1es> dogarrhea2, I like the way you documentate
[22:59:47] <dogarrhea2> this is very very ugly.. i have to put append logic inside the constructor function or explicitly set absolute position right after a call to draggable since the document does not see my element has having position:absolute until I append
[22:59:52] <dogarrhea2> either way is a workaround or a hack
[23:00:24] <dogarrhea2> i'm not even going to put start and stop functions outside the object.. that's even more ridiculous
[23:01:58] <dogarrhea2> good to know after mroe than half a decade, an average schmoe like me can find bugs in jquery
[23:02:04] <dogarrhea2> and it's unusable still :(
[23:02:20] <coldhead> utterly
[23:02:49] <Spadeski> Sup people
[23:03:08] <coldhead> the parlous state of jquery, apparently
[23:05:01] <Spadeski>  nice
[23:06:21] <Spadeski> coldhead check it http://gotactics.net
[23:07:33] <coldhead> ooh shiny
[23:08:33] <Spadeski> thank ya
[23:17:06] <karani> hi
[23:17:12] <karani> having problem with IE
[23:17:18] <karani> for jquery
[23:17:19] <karani> need help
[23:20:04] <dogarrhea2> draggable is slow and jarring :(
[23:20:12] <dogarrhea2> hrm i should probably use some other library
[23:20:32] <dobie> dogarrhea2: like what
[23:20:51] <dogarrhea2> some library that doesn't make drag and drop slow and jarring.
[23:21:06] <dogarrhea2> i don't like it when my mouse lags then suddenly appears somewhere else when i drag something
[23:25:19] <Spadeski> dogarrhea2:  Other elements as PC Speed effect the animations as well
[23:30:57] <new2net> if $("#log") is the id of a <table>, how do select <tbody>?  is it: $("#log tbody")
[23:44:03] <elvisds> I'm writing a widget that uses jquery and will sit on a third party website. Is noConflict() sufficient to ensure it does not interfere with a jquery instance on the host site?
[23:51:09] <perverse> hey, can anyone tell me what $.httpSuccess(); was replaced with when it was deprecated?
[23:51:27] <perverse> i've got some super old code here that i need to get up to scratch, lol
[23:55:42] <cypha> can I do $.ajax within $.tmpl and within <script type="x-jquery-tmpl">?
