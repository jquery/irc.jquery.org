[00:00:09] <cjohnson> if you reveal one of the clothing elements in your console you can see the left and top are all that's changing
[00:00:41] <cjohnson> Kartagis: I have no clue what that means I don't use drupal. it shouldn't be relevant though
[00:00:54] <cjohnson> Kartagis: let's take a step back. 1: tell me exactly which error you're getting
[00:02:56] <Kartagis> cjohnson: I am getting this shield-like icon in the address toolbar and the message "this website has insecure content" or such
[00:03:13] <cjohnson> okay. so it sounds like as said, you're mixing https and http
[00:03:28] <cjohnson> open your console, it will usually tell you which file is being loaded over mixed type
[00:03:58] <Chulbul> It was old version of jqgrid.min.js, now I don't need migrate.js anymore
[00:20:33] <krambiorix> hi, when i open my browser after 24 hours of not working, i see that i'm still logged in in my web application....  When i press any link, it leads me to the login page. How can i, on opening my browser, navigate to the login page immediately?
[00:21:25] <Cork> krambiorix: you're not really "still logged in"
[00:21:31] <cjohnson> not really a #jquery question krambiorix
[00:21:50] <krambiorix> Cork, i know, but any idea on this?
[00:21:52] <Cork> and ya, off topic for this channel
[00:21:59] <mjz13> krambiorix press F5? ;D
[00:22:04] <Cork> krambiorix: find the support channel for the browser
[00:22:46] <krambiorix> Cork, ok thx
[00:56:32] <krambiorix> Cork, i think pageShow is for jquery mobile
[00:56:47] <Cork> nope
[00:56:51] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/pageshow
[00:57:29] <krambiorix> Cork, this is what i have : http://jsfiddle.net/6547bs6d/
[00:58:17] <Cork> krambiorix: start with http://jsfiddle.net/6547bs6d/1/
[00:58:24] <Cork> and see if it fires on a session restore
[00:59:53] <krambiorix> Cork, i only tested with closing the browser and opening it again, i assume that this is enough?
[00:59:59] <Cork> ya
[01:00:23] <krambiorix> Cork, when opening the browser , firebug is not started yet :s
[01:00:32] <Cork> shouldn't matter
[01:01:58] <krambiorix> Cork, yet it performs pageShow, but also on every page load
[01:02:00] <Cork> hmm it fires on every page load, not just session restor
[01:02:05] <krambiorix> yeah :)
[01:02:29] <Cork> that's a pitty
[01:03:53] <krambiorix> Cork, is there an event when the browser ( 's tab) gets closed? Then i can logout first ?
[01:04:22] <Cork> not explicitly related to closing the tab, but beforeunload
[01:04:32] <Cork> but you can't really depend on it
[01:04:49] <Cork> not all browsers fires it anymore
[01:05:18] <krambiorix> Cork, hmm pitty indeed
[01:05:31] <Cork> krambiorix: do you know when the session would expire?
[01:05:54] <Cork> you could store that client side and use that on page load to know if you should reload
[01:06:16] <Cork> heck you could just store the current time and if the last time update was "too old" you could reload
[01:06:58] <Cork> there are plenty of solutions, it all depends on what you want to achieve
[01:07:19] <krambiorix> Cork, when the user clicks somewhere in the page, the timer is resetted
[01:07:40] <Cork> krambiorix: ya, but client side would have to get this info too
[01:07:46] <Cork> else it can't react on it
[01:07:56] <krambiorix> Cork, i mean, jquery resets the timer
[01:08:03] <Cork> what?
[01:08:12] <krambiorix> i just keep a variable "timer"
[01:08:27] <krambiorix> i put it on 0 when the user clicks somehwere
[01:08:55] <Cork> if anything you should store a date instead
[01:09:13] <Cork> depending on a timer to tick things up won't really work
[01:10:09] <krambiorix> Cork, i use that to check when the user should be logged out automatically
[01:10:16] <krambiorix> when timer = 100000 -> logout
[01:10:37] <Cork> krambiorix: sure, but depending on something to tick every second, for things to work is problematic
[01:10:42] <Cork> timers isn't precise like that
[01:10:52] <Cork> so instead you should store the start time
[01:10:57] <Cork> and use that as a base
[01:11:11] <krambiorix> Cork, store in cache?
[01:11:18] <Cork> so if a timer takes 1500 instead of 1000 you won't calculate wrong
[01:14:40] <krambiorix> Cork, would it be best to store the start time in cache?
[01:14:48] <Cork> in cache?
[01:14:53] <Cork> what do you mean by that?
[01:15:52] <krambiorix> Cork, localStorage.setItem ...
[01:16:01] <Cork> that isn't cache
[01:16:04] <Cork> but ya
[01:21:33] <krambiorix> Cork, when a user doesn't click for 20 minutes, i want to logout completely... How can i do that without setInterval ? Or is setInterval precise?
[01:21:56] <Cork> krambiorix: setTimeout
[01:22:08] <Cork> and set a new timeout when you're done in the old one
[01:22:25] <Cork> krambiorix: setInterval doesn't take the amount of time the code in the callback takes to execute into account
[01:22:38] <Cork> so you get end up in a situation where the code runs constantly
[01:22:46] <krambiorix> ow ok
[01:23:02] <Cork> *so you can end up in a
[01:23:18] <krambiorix> Cork,  but before setting the new timeout i have to destroy the previous one  , no?
[01:23:29] <Cork> setTimeout only fires once
[01:23:32] <Cork> so no
[01:24:25] <Cork> function autoLogout() { /* make check */ setTimeout(autoLogout, 2000); } setTimeout(autoLogout, 2000);
[01:25:26] <krambiorix> ok, i'll try that
[01:54:22] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks , it works!
[01:54:32] <krambiorix> thank you for your guidance and support :D
[02:21:36] <Mazi> Hi jquery experts! Can someone tell me how to insert a variable at a CSS ID within JS? This is the code: http://pastebin.com/HSBxnfQX
[02:21:48] <Mazi> this part is obiously wrong: $('#jctab tr#limeanswers:last').after('<tr id="limeanswers.i"><td id="answerlabel".i></td>');
[02:22:10] <Mazi> how can I add the value if var "i" to the CSS ID?
[02:25:48] <Cork> Mazi: tr#limeanswers:last <-- this makes no sense
[02:26:00] <Cork> id by definition can only identify a single element
[02:26:06] <Cork> to tr and :last is pointless
[02:26:37] <Mazi> Cork, you are right, that's next on my list. but for now I need to solve the problem of passing var "i" as part of the CSS ID
[02:26:58] <Cork> Mazi: but the code doesn't work
[02:27:28] <Uhkis> '+i+'
[02:27:29] <Cork> $('#jctab #limeanswers').after('<tr id="limeanswers' + i + '"><td id="answerlabel' + i + '"></td>');
[02:27:35] <Cork> might be what you're looking for though
[02:27:47] <Cork> might be what you're looking for though
[02:27:50] <Cork> opps
[02:27:50] <Mazi> Cork, thanks for the hint, let me test this
[02:28:03] <Cork> actually $('#limeanswers').after('<tr id="limeanswers' + i + '"><td id="answerlabel' + i + '"></td>');
[02:28:49] <Cork> Mazi: looks like what you really should do is replace the ids with classes
[02:29:03] <Uhkis> also: close the <tr>
[02:29:06] <Cork> cause this won't ever work with id's
[02:29:10] <Cork> true
[02:31:08] <Mazi> Cork, Uhkis, thanks for your help and eagle eyes (closing TR)!
[03:11:34] <Sendoushi> hey guys. i have a string like 'data-p="1" data-b="2" data-c="3"' i want to add all this to my element. how can i do this without having to attr() each of the attributes? ideas?
[03:42:32] <BryanRuiz> hmm..  i was looking for a way to quickly save a form and all the inputs populated in that form   $('#form').html(); saves the form but I dont get the inputs..  any ideas?
[03:44:41] <BryanRuiz> found some plugins that do that
[03:50:13] <Laban> BryanRuiz: Another way is to serialize the form.
[03:51:18] <Laban> var serializedData = $("#form").serialize();
[03:59:35] <nikio_> hello
[03:59:40] <nikio_>  what does this command do?
[03:59:40] <nikio_> $(".tabs a span").removeClass("active");
[04:00:52] <BryanRuiz> i think i like that way better laban thanks.. i found an unserialize plugin to go with it
[04:02:00] <BryanRuiz> nikio_: it removes the class active from the span thats inside the <a> thats inside the element with a class tabs
[04:02:26] <nikio_> ok ty
[04:24:02] <BryanRuiz> if i call break inside a function, will it break me out of a switch statement outside of the function?
[04:26:38] <Cork> BryanRuiz: no
[04:26:58] <Cork> break only goes up to the closest function scope
[04:27:12] <Cork> so if you directly inside a function call break; you should get an exception
[04:28:31] <Cork> BryanRuiz: http://jsfiddle.net/p4wy9Lyg/
[04:28:39] <BryanRuiz> thankscork
[04:35:24] <root3d> is there a way i can display message to user ,if any of the javascript function return error. i may be included like of anythin, any function like $.afterreload() !
[04:35:40] <Cork> ?g onerror
[04:35:41] <b-ot> Cork: GlobalEventHandlers.onerror - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers.onerror
[04:36:10] <root3d> ok
[04:36:17] <Cork> so just do .on('error') on the window object
[04:42:11] <Erwat> interesting, i just saw code written by someone in our project
[04:42:23] <Erwat> and it has a comment next to it linking to a thread on stack overflow
[04:43:17] <Uhkis> now where's the interesting part? :-)
[04:43:25] <Cork> XD
[04:46:53] <BryanRuiz> is it possible to change the selector in a jquery chain?
[04:49:12] <Cork> BryanRuiz: you can refine it
[04:49:16] <Cork> but no, not change it
[04:49:23] <BryanRuiz> thanks cork
[04:49:29] <Cork> no point in chaining it if you want to change it
[05:06:29] <Xatenev> Heya guys
[05:06:39] <Xatenev> I have a tab, which should scroll up when clicked
[05:06:50] <Xatenev> and scroll down again when clicked again
[05:07:00] <Xatenev> Nevermind
[05:07:12] <Xatenev> my head just told me what I need .. :P
[05:13:01] <john-dev> is it possible to user .load together with .html? i don’t want to create extra div’s just to input a content into itself
[05:13:04] <john-dev> use*
[05:13:28] <Cork> ug
[05:13:29] <john-dev> like $.(‚#mydiv‘).load(url, ‚#mydiv‘);
[05:13:49] <john-dev> but this would add a div #mydiv into the div #mydiv
[05:13:58] <Cork> ah, no
[05:14:12] <john-dev> i hate to use a workaround for that..
[05:14:24] <Cork> you could do $('#mydiv').load(url + ' #mydiv > *')
[05:14:32] <john-dev> >*? <- let me try this
[05:14:40] <Cork> but it will only grab the children of the div, not text if there is any directly inside the div
[05:15:14] <Cork> slao you should do this server side instead of sending the full page
[05:15:33] <john-dev> well that’s awesome, thanks :)
[05:15:40] <john-dev> i do ;)
[05:15:48] <john-dev> but #mydiv is still the parent
[05:18:29] <john-dev> http://theurl/mobile/projects?.ui-content>* <- is this normal?
[05:18:40] <john-dev> the .ui-content>* is appended to the url
[05:18:41] <Cork> you forgot the space
[05:18:50] <john-dev> $('.ui-content').load($('#request_uri').val()+'/?refreshContent', '.ui-content > *');
[05:18:59] <Cork> you forgot the space
[05:19:27] <john-dev> ah it’s not comma sperated?
[05:19:37] <Cork> its a hack ya
[05:19:50] <john-dev> ok, i get it.. thanks :)
[05:20:06] <Cork> but like i said, you really should do this server side instead
[05:22:00] <john-dev> i do, i only send the .ui-content but the .ui-content div is the parent, i don’t want to step in one div in the template
[05:22:38] <Cork> so replace the parent of .ui-content
[05:22:55] <Cork> or rather run .load on the parent of .ui-content
[05:27:00] <Naphatul> i'm using this: https://bpaste.net/show/1334ba194bb7
[05:27:07] <Naphatul> when i type in the code manually it works
[05:27:11] <Naphatul> the problem is the on change part
[05:27:21] <Naphatul> does it not support that particular selector?
[05:27:32] <Naphatul> it also worked before i changed the selector type
[05:27:46] <john-dev> Thank Cork, this does the trick for me
[05:27:47] <john-dev> $.get($('#request_uri').val()+'/?refreshContent',function(data){
[05:27:47] <john-dev> 		$('.ui-content').html($('<div>',{html:data}).find('.ui-content').html()).trigger('create');
[05:27:48] <john-dev> 	});
[05:28:18] <Cork> john-dev: don't pase multi line code in the channel
[05:28:26] <john-dev> ok
[05:42:18] <d0de> What's the simplest way to get client-side JS to talk to a database for user authentication? Up til now I've only done client-side JS applications, but my next project needs user accounts. Any recommendations?
[05:43:14] <Cork> d0de: you one way or another have to have a server between the database and the js
[05:43:32] <Naphatul> any ideas why the function isn't trigering?
[05:43:39] <Cork> something that sanitize the queries and do permission handling
[05:44:25] <d0de> Cork, what would you suggest I look at to get started?
[05:44:52] <Cork> d0de: depends on what you need, a rest api might work
[05:44:59] <d0de> I suspect that my hosting costs are going to go up massively, the nice thing about entirely client-side apps is that you can host thousands of concurrent users on a $5 vps
[05:45:04] <Cork> way way to litlt context to say what you need
[05:45:44] <Morthez> d0de: so the application wont send any data anywhere?
[05:46:27] <d0de> I'm building a content discovery application. What I need is a user account system based on email/password that let's me store preferences and view-content for each user account
[05:47:00] <d0de> excuse me, that should be "viewed-content", i.e. an identifier for what content has already been seen
[05:47:30] <d0de> The actual content discovery portion and all the application logic will be client-side
[05:47:48] <d0de> I know how to build all that, it's just the user account system I have no experience with
[05:48:57] <bacobart> well you would need to decide on what platform, database and server side language you would want to use
[05:49:10] <bacobart> typically there's the LAMP-stack
[05:49:22] <bacobart> or if you prefer microsoft you could use asp.net/mvc for example
[05:49:29] <bacobart> or ruby, java, python take your pick;p
[05:49:44] <d0de> Well I'm used to working with linux and nginx
[05:49:59] <d0de> I have a tiny bit of mysql experience
[05:50:48] <d0de> I think I'll be OK with the actual database side of things, there seems to be loads of resources available for learning and I think my needs will be relatively modest
[05:51:29] <d0de> it's more the connection between the database and the client-side javascript that I'm confused about where to get started. If there's a server between them, what that server looks like, how it communicates etc
[05:51:51] <d0de> and how the authentication works with that connection
[05:53:15] <bacobart> typically a webapp posts user credentials to the server, the server validates them and on succes sends back a cookie with an session id
[05:53:36] <bacobart> all subsequent request uses the session id so the server knows what user is making the request
[05:54:37] <bacobart> you need to decide on what server side language you want to use and google a login tutorial or something for it:P
[05:55:35] <d0de> OK, thanks. I'm leaning to node.js
[05:55:48] <d0de> I guess you have to HTTPS everything as well, sigh
[05:55:56] <d0de> I've been so spoiled up to now
[05:56:36] <bacobart> yes if you're submitting sensitive information you'll want https
[05:57:18] <Cork> well actually as soon as you do any form of login you should always stay in ssl
[05:57:24] <d0de> yeah, it's just a shame cos it seems like it hugely raises the complexity of the hosting infrastructure
[05:57:28] <Cork> as else the session can be easily stolen
[05:57:41] <Cork> d0de: it doesn't
[05:57:49] <Cork> you can get ssl certs for free
[05:57:55] <d0de> I'm used to just cloning servers when I need more capacity, can you still do that with ssl?
[05:58:11] <Cork> and unless you must support windows xp you can even run multiple sites on one ip
[05:58:27] <bacobart> session should be bound to an ip anyway ;p
[05:58:35] <bacobart> but yeah staying on https is a good idea
[05:58:53] <Cork> bacobart: and if multiple computers is on the same hotspot?
[05:58:59] <Cork> what would separate them then?
[05:59:12] <bacobart> the session id still
[05:59:23] <Cork> that would be submitted in the clear to anyone could grab it ya
[05:59:33] <Cork> that is what i meant
[05:59:39] <bacobart> on the same lan yes
[06:00:01] <Cork> firesheep showed us just how easy it is to steal ppls sessions in a public hotspot if the site doesn't use ssl
[06:00:18] <d0de> Like, if I have a ton of nginx servers on different IPs serving the same content (i.e. round-robin DNS without a loud balancer) can I terminate the SSL on each of those servers?
[06:00:18] <Cork> and those public hotspots are common
[06:00:26] <Naphatul> no ideas why the event isn't triggering?
[06:00:54] <bacobart> d0de, yes, you can install an ssl certificate on multiple servers
[06:00:57] <Cork> d0de: yes, you can
[06:01:17] <bacobart> it's the other way round that causes (some) problems (multiple ssl certs on the same ip)
[06:01:26] <Cork> ya
[06:01:38] <d0de> OK, that's good. I really like lots of small servers for serving content cheaply
[06:01:55] <Cork> what the problem is that early ssl hand shakes didn't include the target host
[06:02:11] <Cork> so if you have multiple domain names pointing to the same ip
[06:02:20] <Cork> the server had no way of knowing what cert to send
[06:02:40] <Cork> nsi fixed that, but microsoft didn't feel like fixing that for xp
[06:02:59] <Cork> though older android doesn't support it either
[06:03:23] <Cork> uh
[06:03:30] <Cork> sorry sni not nsi >_<
[06:04:30] <Cork> and ya sadly android 2.3 is still quite popular
[06:05:17] <d0de> getting flashbacks of trying to make my android app compatible with 2.x
[06:05:24] <d0de> that was not a good idea
[06:05:45] <Cork> 2.x is horrible ya 2.3 is... *ok* i guess
[06:05:51] <bacobart> d0de, out of curiosity, how are you gathering content client side?
[06:05:52] <Cork> but 2.2 is ugg
[06:05:55] <bacobart> d0de, are you using other ppls apis?
[06:06:49] <d0de> bacobart, no, I'm serving it myself staticly and fetching it from client-side js as needed
[06:09:25] <d0de> I know there are frameworks like Express for building web apps with node but honestly I really dislike frameworks and would prefer to just everything apart from authentication myself
[06:09:54] <mobiler> hi, i love jquery and now learning jqmobile. How can i get my form to look like that http://gyazo.com/1a2635ca219f2e8c3f64d4cbbc212c59
[06:10:28] <mobiler> i tried using the grid system but i cant get it aligned
[06:11:22] <mobiler> do you guys know of a good tutorial / snippet /... to help me with this form?
[06:13:42] <ThoMe> hiho
[06:14:03] <mobiler> http://pastebin.com/JJp8a89R
[06:14:09] <ThoMe> $('#' + printerName).children('td.printerNameRow').("input:checked[name='massenAenderungCheckbox[]']").prop( "checked", false );
[06:14:12] <ThoMe> what is here rong?
[06:14:25] <ThoMe> i would like inside from td.printerNameRow search the checkfields
[06:14:32] <ThoMe> and change from checked to unchecked
[06:14:32] <mobiler> here is how tried to do it using the grid it with
[06:14:39] <ThoMe> can anyone help me please?
[06:14:58] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: You need to use .find(), can't just do $('.foo').('.bar')
[06:15:05] <ThoMe> hm ok
[06:15:18] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: like $('#' + printerName).children('td.printerNameRow')..find("input:checked[name='massenAenderungCheckbox[]']").prop( "checked", false ); ?
[06:15:41] <BillCriswell> Just a single .
[06:15:43] <beasty> ThoMe: shouldn't it be .children('td.' + printerName + 'Row')
[06:16:17] <BillCriswell> You can just do $('#foo').find('td.printerNameRow input:checked[whatver]') as well, though.
[06:16:24] <beasty> idd
[06:17:18] <mobiler> do you know of a better pklace to ask jq mobile questions?
[06:18:04] <Cork> mobiler: this is the correct channel, though jqm isn't very commonly used so you will have to reask and wait for someone who does
[06:18:19] <beasty> hi Cork o/
[06:18:31] <Cork> ello
[06:18:38] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: ah, ok, like $('#' + printerName).find("td.printerNameRow input:checked[name='massenAenderungCheckbox[]']").prop("checked", false); ?
[06:18:50] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: Yes.
[06:18:56] <ThoMe> thank you :-)
[06:19:15] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: The :checked is just adding complexity to selector. It doesn't seem like it matters if it's checked or not so you can remove that.
[06:20:08] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: do you think I should not use that?
[06:20:56] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: It's up to you. I wouldn't since I'm unchecking it no matter what.
[06:22:51] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: It's not going to make any noticeable difference anyway. Probably shouldn't have even mentioned it.
[06:23:08] <ThoMe> when i use prop( "checked", false ); on my checkbox and I use $("[name='massenAenderungCheckbox[]']").change(function (e) {
[06:23:14] <ThoMe> then dosnt works
[06:23:16] <ThoMe> change != change?
[06:23:23] <ThoMe> change only with the mouse/keyboard?
[06:23:37] <Cork> change is "user changed the field"
[06:23:47] <Cork> not "field was modified by code"
[06:24:00] <ThoMe> Cork: what can i do via code?
[06:24:17] <Cork> events is always only to know when user or browser does something
[06:24:24] <ThoMe> hm ok
[06:24:28] <Cork> there aren't normally events for when your code does anything
[06:24:33] <Cork> you can trigger fake events
[06:24:39] <Cork> but you will have to do it manually
[06:24:47] <Cork> .trigger('change') for example
[06:24:53] <ThoMe> öh.
[06:25:03] <BillCriswell> After the .prop('checked', false)
[06:25:08] <Cork> ya
[06:25:17] <ThoMe> $("[name='massenAenderungCheckbox[]']")..trigger('change') ?
[06:25:31] <Cork> .prop('checked', false).trigger('change')
[06:25:54] <Cork> order matters
[06:26:29] <BillCriswell> Also, I can't think of a time you'd use .. in javascript.
[06:26:45] <ThoMe> oder
[06:26:46] <ThoMe> or
[06:26:49] <ThoMe> $('#' + printerName).find("td.printerNameRow input:checked[name='massenAenderungCheckbox[]']").prop("checked", false).change();
[06:26:52] <ThoMe> .change() :-)
[06:27:35] <Cork> .change() is a shorthand for .trigger('change') or .on('change') ya
[06:27:55] <BillCriswell> It's much less clear in my opinion, but yeah that'll work.
[06:27:57] <Cork> (depending on if you give it a function or not)
[06:28:03] <ThoMe> Cork: hm ok. thank you very much. tambien a BillCriswell
[06:28:40] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:28:54] <ThoMe> can I catch strg +a ?
[06:28:57] <ThoMe> ctrl +a ?
[06:29:00] <ThoMe> (mark all)
[06:29:03] <Cork> sure
[06:29:13] <Cork> just bind a keydown or keyup on document
[06:29:30] <ThoMe> hm ok
[06:29:36] <Cork> and check event.keyCtrl i think it is called...
[06:29:53] <Cork> nope
[06:29:59] <Cork> event.ctrlKey
[06:31:30] <ThoMe> $( "document" ).keyup(function( event ) { ?
[06:31:48] <Cork> if you want to use the shorthand, yes
[06:31:51] <BillCriswell> No quotes.
[06:31:55] <ThoMe> ah ok
[06:31:56] <Cork> but..
[06:31:57] <Cork> ya
[06:32:00] <Cork> $(document)
[06:32:05] <ThoMe> oki
[06:34:10] <mobiler> hi, i am asking again. can anyone help me getting this http://pastebin.com/JJp8a89R  to look like this http://gyazo.com/1a2635ca219f2e8c3f64d4cbbc212c59   ?
[06:34:46] <ThoMe> Cork: emm
[06:35:08] <ThoMe> Cork: $(document).on('keyup', function (event) { if (event.ctrlKey) { if (event.keyCode == 65) {event.preventDefault(); alert('You pressed CTRL+A'); }}});
[06:35:11] <ThoMe> this works
[06:35:22] <ThoMe> but I dont like mark my text
[06:35:24] <ThoMe> is it posible?
[06:35:35] <Cork> uh, you preventDefault
[06:35:44] <Cork> why would it do anything?
[06:36:07] <ThoMe> i would like when i press strg+a (ctrl+a) then mark all my checkbox but NOT mark all text
[06:36:30] <Cork> ah, right read the code wrong
[06:36:35] <Cork> *comment
[06:37:01] <Cork> ThoMe: the browser won't allow you to prevent the default action for the browsers internal key combos
[06:37:15] <Cork> you can reset the selection by code though
[06:38:43] <ThoMe> öh. yes? hm ok
[06:38:43] <ThoMe> :-)
[06:42:44] <Naphatul> the following code doesn't work, although without the on change part inputing the other bits work fine, i can't figure out why, code: https://bpaste.net/show/1334ba194bb7
[06:44:08] <Cork> Naphatul: there is way to little context there
[06:44:16] <Cork> "not work" as in what?
[06:44:33] <Cork> what are this code running against?
[06:44:50] <Cork> basically create a jsfiddle with a demo of the problem
[06:45:40] <Naphatul> when i modify the field the script is not running
[06:47:53] <Naphatul> could the problem be that other code is adding fields dynamically?
[06:48:18] <Cork> the event handler binds statically on the elements the selector finds, so possibly
[06:48:40] <Cork> if you dynamically add more elements you want to use delegate instead
[06:50:34] <Naphatul> i looked over the docs and at the bottom it said it has been replaced with .on()
[06:51:38] <Cork> not really replaced no
[06:51:50] <Cork> "super seeded"
[06:52:08] <Cork> but it basically just means you can do all event binding with different syntaxes for .on
[06:52:36] <Cork> Naphatul: but that page explains how you do that with on, as so many ppl fail at understanding how .on works
[06:56:50] <Naphatul> so it should be $('input').delegate('[name*="start"]', 'change', function(){ right ?
[06:57:17] <Cork> no
[06:58:00] <Naphatul> but that's what it says in the docs
[06:58:02] <Cork> Naphatul: when you delegate and event handler you bind it on a static parent
[06:58:06] <Cork> no it doesn't
[06:59:39] <Cork> Naphatul: and again you can do this with .on too, but you need to use .ons delegate syntax
[06:59:42] <Cork> not the bind syntax
[06:59:45] <cannap> hmpf can any tell me how i get all classes from [object HTMLDivElement] i dont know what i need to loop or so
[07:00:14] <Cork> cannap: and what is it you've ran .toString() on?
[07:00:27] <ThoMe> Cork: you man document.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
[07:00:27] <ThoMe> ?
[07:00:45] <Cork> ThoMe: ya, that is one of the two needed syntaxes
[07:00:49] <Cork> ie uses there own thing
[07:00:57] <Naphatul> how do i do that?
[07:01:12] <Cork> Naphatul: ... common read the freaking docs
[07:01:26] <cannap> same
[07:01:50] <Cork> cannap: same what?
[07:02:00] <Cork> you haven't answered the question
[07:02:15] <cannap> i got string [object HTMLDivElement]
[07:02:25] <Cork> ya, and you got this from what?
[07:02:48] <Cork> that is when you have something that is constructed by Object that in it has a div element
[07:02:54] <Cork> it doesn't explain what you have
[07:03:06] <cannap> http://cl.ly/image/1G1k1D1P4047
[07:03:45] <Cork> "[object HTMLDivElement]" is a string it doesn't have classes
[07:03:56] <Cork> until you explain what it is you have converted to a string i can't help you
[07:07:10] <Naphatul> $('.controls').on('change', '[name*="start"]', function(){
[07:07:17] <Naphatul> this still doesn't work
[07:07:25] <Cork> Naphatul: again create a demo
[07:07:52] <Cork> common ppl... we aren't mind readers
[07:08:02] <Cork> you have to give us the info if you want help...
[07:08:09] <Naphatul> it's an autogenerated site with flask-admin i might aswell sit next to the user and do this manually in the time it'll take to create the demo
[07:09:22] <cannap> simple console.log(col.attr('class')); :D
[07:09:38] <Cork> ok do you've serialized a jquery object
[07:09:43] <Cork> could just have showed that
[07:10:10] <Cork> *ok so you
[07:10:22] <jackjack_> can anyone explain why this doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/71UzzaYY basically want to stagger elements opacity animations and then do something once they all resolve
[07:10:46] <Cork> jackjack_: what part doesn't work?
[07:11:30] <Naphatul> the dev tools are showing that both the controlls and the input form have an event
[07:11:37] <jackjack_> Cork: they all fade out at the same time
[07:12:13] <Cork> jackjack_: you start them all at the same time (line 5) so ya
[07:12:29] <Cork> you would have to chain them
[07:13:20] <Cork> jackjack_: simplest is prob to use the queue/unqueue methods
[07:13:55] <Cork> just add a .queue() before each .delay() call
[07:14:03] <Cork> and then .unqueue() in the callback
[07:14:08] <Cork> that should chain the events
[07:14:14] <Cork> *animations
[07:14:58] <jackjack_> inside the callback of the fadeTo Cork?
[07:15:13] <Cork> that works too
[07:15:20] <Cork> but you could use the promise you collect
[07:15:28] <Cork> it all depends on how you want to do it
[07:16:03] <daylum> at this point i regret chosing jqm for my project.
[07:18:45] <Naphatul> so it works if i just put in anything in the field, but doesn't when i use the datepicker
[07:19:17] <Cork> the datepicker doesn't dynamically bind to new elements
[07:19:24] <Cork> you have to initialize it for every new field
[07:21:52] <Naphatul> but all the date fields work fine what do you mean?
[07:22:04] <Naphatul> $(document).on('change','[name*="start"]', function(){
[07:22:09] <Naphatul> that's what i ended up with
[07:22:19] <Cork> Naphatul: i'm just guessing wildly as that is all i can do
[07:22:29] <Cork> so ya, you're on your own
[07:22:44] <Cork> until you share enough info for someone to actually answer why things doesn't work
[07:30:20] <Omar-> in widget factory, how to know if a custom event is prevented or returned false?
[07:31:10] <ThoMe> Cork: huhu?  :-)
[07:31:15] <ThoMe> Cork: have a last question :-)
[07:31:44] <ThoMe> i have
[07:31:44] <ThoMe> document.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {
[07:31:57] <ThoMe> I would all document but not in a formfield (like input)
[07:32:00] <ThoMe> is it posible?
[07:32:29] <Omar-> ThoMe jquery way?
[07:32:33] <ThoMe> yes
[07:32:34] <ThoMe> :-)
[07:33:02] <ThoMe> I'm in the jquery channel :P
[07:33:03] <Omar-> hmmm I dont know if :not(input) would work
[07:33:07] <cannap> thx for help i go off bye
[07:33:36] <Omar-> but try $( ":not(input)" ).on("keydown", function
[07:34:18] <ThoMe> Omar-: $(":not(input)").on("keydown", function (event) { ?
[07:34:25] <ThoMe> hmm. doesnt works. no errors
[07:34:31] <Omar-> or $(document).on("keydown", function (e) { if ( $(e.target).is("input") ) { return false; } });
[07:34:38] <ThoMe> ah ok
[07:34:38] <ThoMe> :-)
[07:35:07] <ThoMe> works fine :-)
[07:35:25] <Omar-> good :) there should be better ways I assume
[07:35:30] <Omar-> let me check
[07:36:43] <Omar-> ThoMe well, it looks like this is the fastest solution
[07:38:38] <Omar-> in widget factory, how to know if a custom event is prevented or returned false?
[07:43:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_trigger
[07:54:03] <_DB> data.objmedia.length  is this how I grab the length of a json response?
[07:56:48] <Omar-> arschmitz I went through api but it doesn't explain how
[07:57:32] <Omar-> arschmitz what I did is: if ( this._trigger("customevent") !== false ) { dosomething }
[07:57:38] <arschmitz> Omar-: If the default action is prevented, false will be returned, otherwise true. Preventing the default action happens when the handler returns false or calls event.preventDefault().
[07:57:39] <Omar-> but is this the right way?
[07:58:41] <arschmitz> yes
[07:59:15] <Omar-> arschmitz http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/wmynawyq/1/ line 53
[07:59:38] <Omar-> I trigger the custom event. Pls test it on second listitem
[07:59:48] <Omar-> it won't swipeleft
[07:59:54] <Omar-> it works as it should
[08:00:01] <Omar-> but I thought maybe there is a better way
[08:00:07] <Omar-> swiperight sorry
[08:00:41] <arschmitz> Omar-: im sorry i dont have time to look through a whole widget right now i need to finish some work
[08:01:10] <Omar-> arschmitz it's okay, I know you have a big job ahead
[08:01:13] <Omar-> good luck :)
[08:01:20] <xQp> Hi, anyone here who can help me?
[08:01:49] <Omar-> xQp just ask
[08:01:56] <Omar-> someone will help will help you
[08:02:04] <Omar-> !ask xQp
[08:02:11] <xQp> what version of jQuery UI do i need for  jQuery 1.11.1 compressed?
[08:02:30] <xQp> or which one can i use and is compatible with 1.11.1?
[08:02:36] <Omar-> latest maybe?
[08:03:30] <xQp> allright just wanted to be save, so ill just use the latest version, thought maybe the latest version just works with jQ 2.x
[08:03:38] <xQp> thx ;)
[08:10:49] <notchris> Hey all
[08:11:07] <notchris> I’m trying to randomly apply a margin-top to generated divs
[08:11:08] <notchris> http://pastebin.com/TY325eps
[08:11:27] <notchris> It generates a random value for margin-top, but applies that same random value to each div
[08:13:46] <BillCriswell> notchris: You'd have to iterate through them all.
[08:13:55] <BillCriswell> and geenrate r each time.
[08:13:58] <notchris> Ahhh
[08:14:09] <BillCriswell> Could get around it by passing a function to .css() for the second parameter.
[08:14:28] <BillCriswell> Like... .css('margin-top', function () { return  Math.floor((Math.random() * 500) + 1); });
[08:14:47] <BillCriswell> I think it'll convert it to pixels? but if not add "px" to what's returned.
[08:19:51] <effortDee> im looking in to disabling vertical scroll when horizontal scroll happens on a mobile device.
[08:19:55] <effortDee> but not getting anywhere
[08:20:39] <effortDee> im thinking jquery scroll vertical happens disable the overflow-x:
[08:20:51] <effortDee> and vice versa with horizontal for a grid style website
[08:23:39] <krambiorix> maybe not the right channel (buth which one is?!) : is there a CMS that can grab the content from MS Word files and show it?
[08:34:56] <zagaza> hi, how could I prevent the page from jumping down when I click those brown tab items? http://newexperience.se/menyer
[08:37:34] <_DB> how can I add a option to a select with jquery?>
[08:39:00] <Omar-> _DB .append()
[08:39:43] <Omar-> $("select").append( "<option value='foo'>foo</option>" );
[08:40:17] <nikio_> hey im new to JQuery so I suck, but I try to learn. Is there a better way to achieve what I am trying to achieve from line 75 onwards?
[08:40:18] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/wmmobrtj/
[08:40:41] <_DB> alright thanks
[08:44:06] <NoiseEee> nikio_: you can just create a straight-up string of html
[08:44:18] <Omar-> nikio_ it's difficult to debug code without seeing results. if you can update your fiddle with html markup, it'll be easier
[08:44:37] <NoiseEee> nikio_: var toInsert = "<div><span>ToDo <input val='type here'></span></div>"
[08:45:18] <nikio_> NoiseEee, but it becomes harder to reference it
[08:45:21] <NoiseEee> nikio_: you're just not leveraging the shortcuts/methods of jquery really, you're still doing natural JS
[08:45:22] <nikio_> to get the input
[08:45:36] <NoiseEee> nikio_: give the tags all the attributes you'd like
[08:45:44] <nikio_> NoiseEee, so how to make it good? i want to leverage
[08:46:00] <NoiseEee> certainly if you want to add listeners, you can create those elements individually (ie: your button on line 100
[08:46:20] <nikio_> NoiseEee, yes but i have to get the value of a specific input on a button click, how can i reference it.. it will be hard
[08:46:51] <nikio_> now i have them as a variable
[08:46:54] <nikio_> so its easy
[08:47:26] <NoiseEee> nikio_: you should really be assigning that listener outside of that.  $('tabs').on('click','button',function(){}) will catch all dynamically created buttons in your 'tabs' reference and send the particular button to the callback function
[08:48:06] <NoiseEee> nikio_: so you can just blindly go creating as many: var easyHTML = "<button type='button' name='coolButton'>" you like and insert them via  someReference.html(easyHTML)
[08:48:49] <NoiseEee> anytime a button is clicked, the button itself is passed to the callback so you *know* which button was clicked.  and you can give your buttons particular attributes (or data- attributes) if you need more information in the callback
[08:50:13] <NoiseEee> nikio_: and by knowing which button was clicked, and what your markup is like, you can navigate to the appropriate input(s) you want and grab their values
[08:52:25] <nikio_> not sure if i understand NoiseEee , Omar- i tried getting it run but no succes so far
[08:52:31] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/wmmobrtj/1/
[08:52:50] <nikio_> if i click the tab. something goes wrong
[08:54:02] <NoiseEee> sorry i don't have time to troubleshoot your stuff nikio_, but in terms of 'how can i make this code better' i hope i've given you a launching point
[08:54:40] <NoiseEee> nikio_: and try http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 for help on how to debug sanely
[08:54:47] <nikio_> NoiseEee, it works on my laptop though
[08:55:05] <nikio_> just not jsfiddle, it asks to use post
[08:55:22] <nikio_> {"error": "Please use POST request"} when i click the second tab
[08:55:48] <nikio_> thanks NoiseEee
[08:57:15] <nikio_> NoiseEee, Omar- it works, i had to set it to use the latest jquery
[08:57:17] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/3bz6xj1r/
[08:57:31] <nikio_> Omar-, now you see what  I am trying to achieve
[08:58:38] <Omar-> nikio_ good luck ;)
[08:59:05] <nikio_> Omar-, how do you think line 75+ can be made better?
[08:59:39] <robertmaxrees> why do all of that work in JS?
[08:59:59] <robertmaxrees> if it needs to be JS, use a templating system of some kind instead.
[09:00:06] <krambiorix> maybe not the right channel (buth which one is?!) : is there a CMS that can grab the content from MS Word files and show it?
[09:00:34] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix try #web
[09:00:39] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, its jquery
[09:00:51] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, i have no idea
[09:00:52] <nikio_> im new
[09:01:03] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ I can see that ;) i'm saying that jquery isn't necessarily the right tool for the job :0
[09:01:03] <Omar-> nikio_ there many ways to achieve the same result. It depends how you want to manipulate elements
[09:01:27] <nikio_> well is my way ok?
[09:01:36] <robertmaxrees> you also keep repeating the same thing over and over, but you change very little - generate your markup once and then .clone() it instead.
[09:02:01] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, but it needs different values for the labels and default input value
[09:02:25] <robertmaxrees> sure - edit the clones after the fact.
[09:03:29] <nikio_> how?
[09:03:39] <robertmaxrees> already getting you an example :)
[09:03:43] <Omar-> a simple way to hide/show elements based on tab, without the need to create them dynamically over and over
[09:03:56] <zagaza> how could I prevent the page from jumping down when I click those brown tab items? http://newexperience.se/menyer   and here is the js for it: http://jsfiddle.net/teahnu48/
[09:04:00] <Omar-> add html markup once and that's it
[09:04:16] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, the problem is that i have to be able to reference each input value seperately in my button click function
[09:04:31] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ that doesn't change my suggestion at all.
[09:04:37] <robertmaxrees> you're repeating the same work over and over.
[09:04:50] <graphettion> zagaza: Do you want it to scroll down?
[09:04:53] <NoiseEee> nikio_: honestly, read over what i said.
[09:05:01] <zagaza> graphettion no
[09:05:16] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, im just not sure how i can reference them otherwise
[09:05:27] <NoiseEee> nikio_: anytime a button is clicked, the button itself is passed to the callback so you *know* which button was clicked.  and you can give your buttons particular attributes (or data- attributes) if you need more information in the callback
[09:05:30] <NoiseEee> nikio_: and by knowing which button was clicked, and what your markup is like, you can navigate to the appropriate input(s) you want and grab their values
[09:05:33] <zagaza> graphettion I just want it to change the content and not scroll/jump down
[09:05:47] <nikio_> NoiseEee, yes but which callback? and only one tab has a button
[09:05:53] <nikio_> the other tabs are displaying results
[09:06:23] <NoiseEee> one callback to capture them all, and then send onwards to functions if they meet your specification
[09:07:01] <NoiseEee> or load up the button you care about with particular attibutes
[09:07:13] <nikio_> NoiseEee, I dont see, do you have some example somwehere lying around? or one on the net? its hard to see how that would look like in practice
[09:07:24] <graphettion> zagaza: http://jsfiddle.net/teahnu48/2/
[09:07:54] <zagaza> graphettion I mean the tabs not the main menu
[09:08:01] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yzb7qcxt/1/
[09:08:12] <robertmaxrees> see how I create a single template and then clone it as needed?
[09:08:54] <zagaza> graphettion: this is the only code it's using, sorry I confused it with the other code 		$('#tabs ul li a').click(function () {
[09:08:55] <zagaza> 			location.hash = $(this).attr('href');
[09:08:55] <zagaza> 		});
[09:08:56] <zagaza> oops
[09:08:56] <robertmaxrees> well, not really a "template" per se, but you get the idea.
[09:09:04] <zagaza> sorry, I mean http://jsfiddle.net/teahnu48/3/
[09:09:17] <root3d> how can i remove all the elements of <ul> tag ?
[09:09:41] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, very nice, im working on integrating that idea with mine, ill show u the result ina bit
[09:10:01] <graphettion> zagaza: Ah, try http://jsfiddle.net/teahnu48/4/
[09:10:10] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ but listen to NoiseEee et al
[09:10:12] <graphettion> If that doesn't work, not sure
[09:10:18] <robertmaxrees> their ideas and suggestions are sound ;)
[09:11:04] <zagaza> graphettion oddly enough that doesnt work either, I refreshed the page with that so you can try http://newexperience.se/menyer/
[09:11:16] <graphettion> kk
[09:11:56] <graphettion> zagaza: That's odd. Wish I knew. May ask again.
[09:12:10] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, i think i like NoiseEee idea and also Omars suggestion, but i dont see how to implement NoiseEee idea here
[09:12:20] <nikio_> im too noob
[09:12:24] <zagaza> graphettion however when I remove that code, it works like it should.. try now
[09:12:33] <zagaza> but it doesnt update the url
[09:12:36] <nikio_> need a small example to see
[09:12:36] <graphettion> haha
[09:12:54] <graphettion> That's insane. There has to be something effecting it.
[09:15:26] <jeffmjack> does anybody know which directory - src or dist - I should be using in my <script> tags if I install jquery with bower?
[09:15:36] <zagaza> graphettion better yet, is there a good way to update those hashes without having to click them? because if you do http://newexperience.se/menyer/#brolopp you dont come to the second tab, but if you click the second tab the url updates
[09:16:46] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack dist.
[09:16:57] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[09:17:28] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ what part of their suggestions don't you understand?
[09:17:33] <robertmaxrees> that's a much better way to get help.
[09:17:37] <robertmaxrees> instead of saying "I don't get it"
[09:18:14] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, hmm im not sure what callback he ment but now it came to me
[09:18:36] <graphettion> zagaza: Something work related popped up, bbl, hopefully someone else can take a swing at it
[09:18:37] <graphettion> :/
[09:19:01] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, i understood now :D
[09:19:06] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ $('selector').on('event', function() {}); -> the function is the callback.
[09:19:28] <nikio_> yes but i thought he ment some other function defined somewhere else for some reason
[09:19:34] <nikio_> or that it would be needed
[09:19:37] <nikio_> but now i see
[09:22:05] <robertmaxrees> you could define that function elsehwere btw.
[09:22:31] <[1]Bower^Work> is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui designed to be used in production? i *just* want datepicker functionality but wish to bring it in via bower so using the site to generate the files isn't really suitable
[09:23:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:23:18] <Omar-> nikio_ http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/xu9d926u/
[09:23:21] <Omar-> hide/show
[09:23:27] <robertmaxrees> jquery UI is obviously production ready.
[09:23:49] <[1]Bower^Work> i meant more the state of the repo
[09:24:10] <robertmaxrees> don't use master
[09:24:12] <robertmaxrees> use a release.
[09:24:23] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/1.11.2
[09:24:48] <nikio_> Omar-, very nice, did you only change the js? or also the css and html?
[09:25:45] <[1]Bower^Work> have you personally pulled in files from that using bower and used in productions? it has dickpicker, autocomplete and so on but in isolation they don't work. presumably there's some other .js file i'm suppose to use?
[09:25:52] <nikio_> Omar-, just .hidden {
[09:25:52] <nikio_>     display:none;
[09:25:52] <nikio_> } in the css?
[09:26:05] <robertmaxrees> [1]Bower^Work you can't just pull in the datepicker js - you need a custom build of jqui.
[09:26:12] <robertmaxrees> there are dependencies at play.
[09:26:36] <PsychoBoB> Hi Guys
[09:26:39] <Omar-> nikio_ http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/xu9d926u/
[09:26:40] <Omar-> updated
[09:26:44] <PsychoBoB> I have many checkbox in my form
[09:26:58] <PsychoBoB> With id bo1, bo2, bo3, bo4...
[09:27:06] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ PsychoBoB
[09:27:06] <b-ot> PsychoBoB: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:27:13] <PsychoBoB> I need validate if one or more are checked
[09:27:22] <PsychoBoB> How I do it?
[09:27:31] <[1]Bower^Work> robertmaxrees, thanks. that's what i was (in a roundabout way) getting at.
[09:27:54] <robertmaxrees> [1]Bower^Work i figured ;)
[09:28:12] <[1]Bower^Work> sorry, been a very long day :)
[09:28:32] <PsychoBoB> Anyone here can help me?
[09:28:35] <nikio_> ty Omar, that fixed the tab switching effect
[09:28:43] <nikio_> Omar-,
[09:28:44] <robertmaxrees> PsychoBoB i just told you to paste up some code.
[09:28:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:29:24] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees don't necessary paste code
[09:29:29] <PsychoBoB> because he dont exists
[09:29:29] <robertmaxrees> PsychoBoB LOL
[09:29:31] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[09:29:34] <robertmaxrees> I mean your html.
[09:29:35] <PsychoBoB> :)
[09:29:35] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[09:29:39] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees
[09:29:43] <PsychoBoB> Many checkbox
[09:29:45] <PsychoBoB> just
[09:29:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't want the whole thing - just a self-contained example.
[09:29:58] <robertmaxrees> with a few.
[09:30:02] <PsychoBoB> And your id are
[09:30:09] <PsychoBoB> bo1, bo2, bo3, bo4, ....
[09:30:36] <[1]Bower^Work> PsychoBoB, if you want help, help yourself. think about the question and provide any relevant code. spanning your question over multiple lines isn't particularly helpful
[09:30:37] <PsychoBoB> <input type="checkbox" id="bo1" value="1">
[09:30:38] <PsychoBoB> :)
[09:30:43] <robertmaxrees> PsychoBoB http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fpofmcqc/
[09:30:48] <robertmaxrees> this is all I wanted you to do.
[09:30:49] <robertmaxrees> not hard at all.
[09:31:05] <robertmaxrees> PsychoBoB so you want to know how many are checked?
[09:31:11] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees
[09:31:13] <PsychoBoB> Yeap
[09:31:21] <PsychoBoB> But befor submit the form
[09:31:30] <robertmaxrees> that's a different question.
[09:31:33] <PsychoBoB> I want check if one or more are checked
[09:31:37] <robertmaxrees> update that fiddle with an example of your html.
[09:31:39] <robertmaxrees> that's why I asked for that.
[09:31:45] <robertmaxrees> you're now changing what you want ;)
[09:31:48] <PsychoBoB> I don't can submit without a checkbox checked
[09:32:27] <PsychoBoB> I need to send the form if at least one is marked
[09:32:40] <robertmaxrees> easy - see if any checkboxes in the form are checked, and e.preventDefault() on the submit event if they're not.
[09:32:48] <PsychoBoB> yes
[09:32:51] <PsychoBoB> but, How?
[09:32:56] <robertmaxrees> it's very simple.
[09:33:00] <robertmaxrees> i just told you exactly what to do ;)
[09:33:12] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, can this be improved? i used your idea
[09:33:13] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/3bz6xj1r/
[09:33:14] <robertmaxrees> (see how annoying that is? update the fiddle)
[09:33:16] <root3d> i have a function then there is a loop in that function , i want to come out of the main function . if i return it will return out of loop only , is there a way to do  that ?
[09:33:24] <nikio_> line 74 onwards
[09:36:39] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees
[09:36:41] <PsychoBoB>  if (jQuery("input[name^='bo']").attr("checked") == true)
[09:36:45] <robertmaxrees> not in the channel.
[09:36:47] <PsychoBoB> It's way
[09:36:47] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle.
[09:36:56] <robertmaxrees> and that's not everything you need to do ;)
[09:37:33] <PsychoBoB> is a and by the way, test whether an element is marked
[09:37:42] <robertmaxrees> only the first of all of inputs.
[09:37:46] <robertmaxrees> that won't do what you want.
[09:38:08] <robertmaxrees> also, you don't want to use .attr('checked'), since that'll only check the initial state of the checkbox, not any changes made to it since the page is loaded.
[09:38:50] <PsychoBoB> I am validate after submit
[09:38:57] <PsychoBoB> In onclick of the button
[09:39:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to work, either.
[09:39:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:39:25] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, did u get my link?
[09:39:31] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ yeah, busy atm.
[09:39:35] <nikio_> ok : ]
[09:39:35] <robertmaxrees> sorry
[09:39:54] <PsychoBoB> $('#frmTest input:checked').length > 0
[09:39:57] <PsychoBoB> :D
[09:40:00] <PsychoBoB> works
[09:40:08] <robertmaxrees> PsychoBoB i'm not going to ask again.
[09:40:30] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees ? about?
[09:42:32] <jeffmjack> anybody know of a good chat room for issues with less.js?
[09:44:29] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: Looks like there's a ##lesscss room, but not ver active.
[09:44:34] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: Maybe try in #css?
[09:44:42] <mikunos> hi guys I have this error: TypeError: $(...).ckeditor is not a function
[09:44:51] <BillCriswell> or if it's more of a... higher level question maybe just ask in #sass?
[09:45:04] <mikunos> but I have included in my compressed js file
[09:45:04] <robertmaxrees> mikunos the plugin isn't loaded yet.
[09:45:08] <BillCriswell> mikunos: Looks like the ckeditor plugin isn't loaded.
[09:45:16] <robertmaxrees> mikunos is it included before your code?
[09:45:36] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell: cool i'll just try css... thanks
[09:45:44] <mikunos> yes guys before the code I have $( '.wysiwyg' ).ckeditor(…)
[09:45:44] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:46:11] <mikunos> I mean that I load the ckeditor and then I call it
[09:46:31] <robertmaxrees> mikunos are you loading jquery a second time?
[09:46:48] <mikunos> robertmaxrees what do you mean?
[09:47:28] <mikunos> this is the compressed file: http://snipet.co.uk/Mf
[09:47:43] <mikunos> I load all the javascript in one file
[09:48:10] <mikunos> and if you try to find the ckeditor
[09:48:10] <mikunos> you can see the reference code
[09:48:23] <BillCriswell> mikunos: Are you concating it in the right order? 1. jquery, 2. plugin, 3. your code using the plugin?
[09:48:26] <mikunos> and then at the end the request $( '.wysiwyg' ).ckeditor(…)
[09:48:30] <infoshark> I'm running a server that is using SSH, and am able to setup the connection to the google CDN site via https://, all works well with respect to the basic jquery functions I've tried up until I get to .open;   $("#div1").load("./demo_test.txt,function(responseTxt,statusTxt,xhr){ - tests, at one point, i was recieving the proper alert (404) up until I specified that relative path, however, the
[09:48:31] <infoshark> file is not loaded (atleast it doesn't appear to be) no error, no replacement text. taken from : http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_ajax_load
[09:48:38] <mikunos> yes BillCriswell
[09:48:47] <infoshark> would the ssh factor play a role with respect to .load ?
[09:49:04] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees
[09:49:05] <PsychoBoB> http://jsfiddle.net/fpofmcqc/1/
[09:49:08] <mikunos> you can see it here: http://snipet.co.uk/Mf
[09:50:26] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees can you see?
[09:50:44] <mikunos> any idea?
[09:51:45] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, maybe it put you off that it didnt work, but i just noticed the link didnt hve jquery compat on
[09:51:47] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/3bz6xj1r/1/
[09:52:20] <BillCriswell> mikunos: In the console type $.fn.ckeditor and see if it returns anything.
[09:52:30] <mikunos> ok
[09:52:40] <mikunos> undefined
[09:52:49] <mikunos> it is really odd!!
[09:53:14] <mikunos> BillCriswell but the code is there!
[09:53:33] <BillCriswell> mikunos: what does $.fn.jquery return?
[09:53:37] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ sorry, working with PsychoBoB right now and then i have some work stuff to take care of.
[09:53:45] <robertmaxrees> PsychoBoB one sec.
[09:53:46] <mikunos> undefined BillCriswell
[09:54:01] <BillCriswell> mikunos: Well, it looks like something else is stealing $ from jQuery.
[09:54:14] <BillCriswell> What does $ return?
[09:54:21] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, np i learned a lot, i just want to know how i could append the divs with jquery like this, at the same time making sure they appear vertically beneath eachother
[09:54:32] <mikunos> function(a, b) BillCriswell
[09:54:43] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ you want to use .append() and then use css to position them.
[09:54:47] <robertmaxrees> or .insertAfter()
[09:55:04] <nikio_> ok Robdgreat
[09:55:04] <BillCriswell> mikunos: If you type a . do any of the auto suggetions look familiay?
[09:55:10] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, *
[09:55:22] <mikunos> BillCriswell ???
[09:55:25] <BillCriswell> mikunos: Like... $. [ Auto complete pop up thinger ]
[09:55:27] <mikunos> If I type…what?
[09:55:55] <mikunos> I have any autocomplete tool
[09:55:58] <BillCriswell> mikunos: Type "$" then a "." and when the auto complete comes up see if any of those methods make sense.
[09:56:02] <BillCriswell> mikunos: In chrome.
[09:56:10] <mikunos> ok
[09:56:26] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees ;)
[09:56:43] <robertmaxrees> what?
[09:56:49] <robertmaxrees> I'm fixing your invalid code
[09:57:05] <robertmaxrees> because what you have doesn't make sense ;)
[09:57:29] <PsychoBoB> Where the code?
[09:57:33] <mikunos> http://i.minus.com/iBxfx3FlscauW.png BillCriswell
[09:57:34] <robertmaxrees> the code in the fiddle.
[09:57:43] <PsychoBoB> How I see it updated?
[09:57:51] <robertmaxrees> you will see it when i'm done.
[09:58:05] <PsychoBoB> hmmm You are developing, right?
[09:58:07] <robertmaxrees> yes
[09:58:11] <BillCriswell> mikunos: That looks like jQuery.
[09:58:13] <PsychoBoB> Got It!
[09:58:19] <PsychoBoB> I'm learning english robertmaxrees
[09:58:22] <PsychoBoB> Sorry
[09:58:28] <BillCriswell> mikunos: You say you typed $.fn.jquery and it came back undefined though?
[09:59:01] <mikunos> BillCriswell no it returns "1.11.1"
[09:59:25] <mikunos> this $.fn.ckeditor returns null
[09:59:28] <mikunos> or undefined
[09:59:28] <robertmaxrees> PsychoBoB jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fpofmcqc/2/
[09:59:44] <BillCriswell> I don't know what you're doing weird then.
[10:00:02] <robertmaxrees> sounds like jquery was re-loaded.
[10:00:54] <PsychoBoB> {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[10:01:04] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[10:01:43] <PsychoBoB> firebug?
[10:01:45] <mikunos> …. I don't understand what issue is
[10:01:46] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:02:09] <robertmaxrees> mikunos you said you're able to use it in one place but not another?
[10:02:33] <mikunos> robertmaxrees what do you mean ?
[10:02:37] <StanAccy> is it possible to locate an element that occurs immediately after a known element (found via ID)?
[10:02:49] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy .next()
[10:02:50] <BillCriswell> mikunos: robertmaxrees believes that you are doing... 1. Load jQuery, 2. Load CKEditor, 3. Load jQuery, 4. Running YOUR Code.
[10:02:56] <StanAccy> i.e. Im trying to find a div with a known class that occurs after a specific <select>
[10:02:59] <mikunos> no no
[10:02:59] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++
[10:03:08] <robertmaxrees> mikunos triple-check.
[10:03:10] <mikunos> I load jQuery only once
[10:03:33] <mikunos> I have shared the whole file http://snipet.co.uk/Mf
[10:03:43] <robertmaxrees> mikunos open your network tab and make sure.
[10:04:02] <mikunos> is only one file
[10:04:08] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[10:04:12] <mikunos> robertmaxrees it is a compressed file
[10:04:13] <robertmaxrees> sometimes strange things happen.
[10:04:44] <mikunos> yes indeed
[10:04:52] <mikunos> but what?!
[10:04:59] <robertmaxrees> your js is getting loaded twice.
[10:05:09] <Zzaichik> double the fun
[10:05:09] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees
[10:05:10] <PsychoBoB> nice
[10:05:11] <PsychoBoB> works fine
[10:05:12] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab in your dev tools and check to make sure that is not the case.
[10:05:17] <PsychoBoB> tks
[10:05:27] <PsychoBoB> thanks a lot is right to say?
[10:05:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:05:39] <PsychoBoB> Thanks a lot !
[10:05:44] <mikunos> robertmaxrees ??!?!?!?
[10:05:51] <mikunos> where do you see it?
[10:05:54] <BillCriswell> ?!?!?!?!?!?!
[10:05:57] <mikunos> in the file shared?
[10:05:57] <robertmaxrees> mikunos not in your JS.
[10:06:04] <robertmaxrees> in your developer tools - the network tab.
[10:06:20] <PsychoBoB> robertmaxrees but I change one line to reduce code
[10:06:36] <BillCriswell> mikunos: is ckeditor even a jQuery plugin?
[10:06:40] <robertmaxrees> paste it here, PsychoBoB
[10:07:03] <mikunos> BillCriswell yes it is
[10:08:13] <BillCriswell> mikunos: http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_jquery did you include this?
[10:08:13] <mikunos> robertmaxrees in the network tab there is only one item java.js
[10:08:30] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  oaky.
[10:11:17] <nikio_> hey what am i doing wrong? http://imgur.com/tL8erGo  .. i highlighted the spans im trying to reference and add a class to: http://imgur.com/tL8erGo
[10:11:35] <nikio_> http://i.imgur.com/tL8erGo.png
[10:12:49] <robertmaxrees> you sure your code is actually reaching that point?
[10:12:53] <robertmaxrees> did you console.log() to make sure?
[10:13:53] <nikio_> yes it says bok
[10:14:32] <mikunos> seems that the problem is the order of all the files
[10:14:36] <mikunos> sort
[10:15:19] <BillCriswell> mikunos...
[10:15:29] <mikunos> BillCriswell ....
[10:16:04] <nikio_> ooh noes am i running into a buggy shmuggy?
[10:16:16] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:16:40] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, yes it did console log the bok string which comes right before
[10:17:10] <nikio_> ahhhh
[10:17:12] <nikio_> i know
[10:17:20] <nikio_> it isnt part of the dom yet i think ;p
[10:17:27] <nikio_> i have to switch the lines
[10:18:10] <nikio_> yep
[10:18:13] <nikio_> as I thought : ]
[10:18:13] <mikunos> but the problem is not solved yet
[10:18:20] <nikio_> it is mikunos  ; ]
[10:18:32] <robertmaxrees> he's talking about his own problem i'm guessing.
[10:18:42] <nikio_> joker ; ]
[10:18:48] <mikunos> an I refer to my problem :D
[10:19:40] <robertmaxrees> mikunos what's the issue now?
[10:20:46] <mikunos> seems that when the php grab all the files and create one huge and compressed file some of the plugin try to get their assets and they don't know the right path
[10:20:55] <mikunos> sorry for my english
[10:21:14] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.
[10:33:30] <Omar-> nikio_
[10:33:49] <Omar-> yes only .hidden { display: none; } and added three content divs
[10:34:03] <Omar-> JS can be simplified further
[10:34:56] <nikio_> Omar-, ok ty
[10:35:14] <Omar-> you're welcome
[10:35:30] <Omar-> just add your own html in content divs
[10:37:51] <Omar-> nikio_ a simplified verion http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/6y09n8ex/
[10:38:20] <Omar-> no if statements
[10:38:29] <robertmaxrees> ++
[10:38:40] <robertmaxrees> getting rid of ifs is always welcome
[10:38:41] <Omar-> thanks robertmaxrees :D
[10:39:09] <Sal> hi
[10:39:43] <Omar-> laters guys
[10:39:47] <Sal> does anyone know a library that lets me drag or swipe a large child div in a parent small div ?
[10:41:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui has draggables
[10:41:50] <nikio_> noes I was  gna ask how it works;[
[10:41:58] <robertmaxrees> how what works?
[10:42:37] <Sal> i would like to avoid jquery ui or jquery mobile
[10:43:02] <robertmaxrees> search around on google then :)
[10:43:12] <Sal> anyway, i'm just trying to make a scrollable tab bar
[10:43:33] <Sal> swiping it on mobile and dragging it on pc if screen size is smaller than bar
[10:43:39] <Sal> any ideas?
[10:43:52] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: next() gives me the next immediate element - is there a way to say "give me the next of this specific type - i.e. provide a selector on the next?
[10:43:53] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, how line 8 till 11 finds the right span to remove the active class from, there are two other spans it could chose
[10:44:27] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: Oh duh, I didnt notice that next() takes a selector.
[10:44:43] <robertmaxrees> still only gets the immediate siblint.
[10:45:08] <robertmaxrees> check out nextAll()
[10:45:22] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: biut it gives me the next immediate sibling that matches the selector, which is what I want
[10:45:49] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy iirc it gets you the next sibling only if it matches that selector.
[10:45:53] <robertmaxrees> i could be wrong though.
[10:46:03] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ 8 - 11?
[10:46:11] <robertmaxrees> which part are you confused about?
[10:46:13] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: thats an easy test though :-) Thanks for the help
[10:46:20] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy fsho
[10:46:47] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, well it gors to parent so it searches a span element which is a child of it.. but there are many span elements, so how does it know which one to remove the active class from
[10:46:53] <nikio_> *goes
[10:47:08] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ it removes it from all descendent spans.
[10:47:37] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, ah ok.. i didnt know that find span would do that,  i thought it would just find the first match
[10:47:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:47:50] <robertmaxrees> .find() is ALL descendent elements.
[10:47:55] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain it ;)
[10:48:04] <nikio_> ok : ]
[10:48:09] <bwarzeski> hello all
[10:49:22] <bwarzeski> looking for guidance on importing js from inside another script and trying to decide whether to use $.getScript or try and implement requireJS.  Any thoughts?
[10:49:37] <robertmaxrees> bwarzeski you want requireJS for that.
[10:49:53] <robertmaxrees> bwarzeski you want to load a module, not the entire file right?
[10:50:25] <bwarzeski> robertmaxrees: nah, the whole file would be fine.  and I am adding this into an already fairly complex system, so the thought of getting requireJS working is a bit daunting
[10:50:45] <robertmaxrees> what does this script to?
[10:50:47] <robertmaxrees> *do
[10:50:56] <robertmaxrees> like, are you trying to just load a file and call it a day?
[10:51:02] <bwarzeski> yes
[10:51:09] <robertmaxrees> why not do it serverside
[10:51:38] <bwarzeski> I split a rather large script into 3 pieces, effectively 2 libraries and something that uses them
[10:52:03] <robertmaxrees> doesn't answer my question >.>
[10:52:12] <robertmaxrees> you want to load a file - why do you need to do it client side?
[10:52:14] <bwarzeski> "do it serverside"?
[10:52:51] <bwarzeski> I want to load the js files for the classes defined in them so that I can use them in another script
[10:52:59] <bwarzeski> not sure if that answers you...
[10:53:09] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to do that in your frontend?
[10:53:17] <robertmaxrees> why can't you just load the file like the other ones?
[10:54:15] <bwarzeski> mostly because I want to do this process with a number of our convoluted panel-sets, without exponentially increasing the import section in my main .html file
[10:54:42] <bwarzeski> And unless I am mis-interpreting your use of "frontend", I believe I am importing all of my js in the frontend (my home.html)
[10:55:22] <robertmaxrees> i mean that your other code is being loaded via your html file, right?
[10:55:26] <bwarzeski> yeah
[10:55:27] <robertmaxrees> you have script tags in there to load them.
[10:55:33] <robertmaxrees> just load this other file like those.
[10:56:47] <bwarzeski> that's what I'm doing now.  I was just hoping to do this to clean up that section of the code a bit
[10:57:04] <robertmaxrees> that's going to make it more complex.
[10:57:07] <robertmaxrees> unnecessarily.
[10:57:24] <bwarzeski> fair enough... I was worried that might be the case
[10:58:08] <robertmaxrees> why worried?
[10:58:44] <bwarzeski> meh, at this point we have about a full page of js imports, and I am about to bump that number a bit in an attempt to clean up old/convoluted code
[10:59:07] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the real problem is that you have pages that are trying to do too much,.
[10:59:44] <bwarzeski> we set up the system so that there is really only one page, which modifies/regenerates itself based on user input
[11:00:12] <robertmaxrees> so it's a SPA?
[11:00:40] <bwarzeski> yeah
[11:01:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, unless you want to convert everything over to, say, require, there's no real reason to hack in some kind of dependency management for a single file imo.
[11:01:56] <bwarzeski> thank you
[11:02:43] <robertmaxrees> we're going through some similar pains here.
[11:02:51] <bwarzeski> unfortunately, I only have one web-dev to draw from (and he isn't even the one that wrote this ui), and he always recommends frameworks when I ask how to do something
[11:03:08] <robertmaxrees> that's because y'all need an actual framework in there.
[11:03:11] <bwarzeski> which would almost always require overhauls outside of the feature I am adding
[11:04:04] <bwarzeski> If I had time to rewrite the thing and understood a framework well enough, I would love to :-p
[11:04:05] <robertmaxrees> those are good projects imo.
[11:04:59] <bwarzeski> right now we've got our tornado backend with a frontend SPA using some bootstrap functionality for layout
[11:05:16] <bwarzeski> and the code is... kind of everywhere
[11:05:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah - we've got a batty coldfusion middleware that we're still fighting against.
[11:13:35] <Primero> somebody know how use jquery to open a window like echo3 into a <div>
[11:13:45] <robertmaxrees> "open a window into a div"
[11:13:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:13:58] <Primero> like echo3 do
[11:14:20] <robertmaxrees> never heard of it.
[11:14:59] <bwarzeski> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18145273/how-to-load-an-external-webpage-into-a-div-of-a-html-page
[11:15:11] <Primero> http://demo.nextapp.com/echo3csjs/
[11:15:20] <robertmaxrees> Primero "window" is ephemeral.
[11:15:37] <Primero> thanks bwarzeski
[11:16:11] <bwarzeski> that what you were looking for?
[11:16:25] <robertmaxrees> might want to check browser support for that btw.
[11:16:27] <Primero> mmm, no, i dotn want load a page, i want a windows, like alert, but whit a form inner
[11:16:43] <robertmaxrees> Primero you can do all of that, but you'd have to write it all yourself.
[11:16:44] <bwarzeski> so, a modal?
[11:16:49] <Primero> a form in a window, like the window of alert
[11:16:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, a modal.
[11:17:33] <Primero> thanks, i will search about modal
[11:18:35] <bwarzeski> Primero: https://gist.github.com/gnubio-bwarzeski/6063d8894e7bb31a0cd6
[11:18:58] <bwarzeski> that was the code that got me working.  I do a bit of this in my current UI
[11:23:03] <Primero> thanks bwarsezki, thats what i need
[11:23:09] <bwarzeski> :-)
[12:16:15] <munix> is there a maintained alternative to http://v3.javascriptmvc.com/docs/jQuery.Class.html ??
[12:22:56] <spudzee> I have a general programming question; which is the largest, boolean, string, int, or float? And which is the smallest - talking about their size in bytes
[12:24:19] <bwarzeski> largest: float  smallest: boolean
[12:24:59] <munix> is there a maintained alternative to http://v3.javascriptmvc.com/docs/jQuery.Class.html ??
[12:25:11] <spudzee> That's what my intuition was telling me, where do strings and ints stand, which is the larger of those two?
[12:25:49] <bwarzeski> well, strings are wierd, as they are really arrays of characters, and are thus pretty much one byte per char (and could be larger)
[12:26:12] <spudzee> so I'd imagine their larger than an int?
[12:26:20] <bwarzeski> ints are actually roughly equivalent to floats in terms of memory (both are 4 bytes in cpp)
[12:26:46] <bwarzeski> they take up a variable amt of memory, I think (unless anyone cares to dispute)
[12:26:53] <bwarzeski> *they = strings
[12:27:31] <bwarzeski> but yeah, a string could contain a full page of text, which would be waaay more data than a simple int
[12:28:25] <spudzee> now that I think about it, asking if a word(s) is larger than a number(s) is a bit of an awkward question
[12:28:43] <bwarzeski> yeah, I was answering assuming char rather than string
[12:28:50] <bwarzeski> a char is smaller than an int
[12:29:15] <spudzee> is it preferable to use the smallest (booleans) when possible, or does it really not matter at this point?
[12:29:27] <bwarzeski> context is important
[12:30:24] <bwarzeski> but in general, I would say it really doesn't matter most of the time
[12:30:43] <bwarzeski> unless you are writing for a severely memory-limited environment/device
[12:30:55] <spudzee> yeah I know, but if I have, say a switch for a game. And it has two possible states: on or off. I guess using a boolean to represent the switch's state is more preferable than having the state be a 1 and 2 int or 'on' and 'off' string
[12:31:02] <bwarzeski> yes
[12:31:47] <bwarzeski> partially in that it is clearer to other people in the code what is going on there.
[12:32:38] <bwarzeski> really, what you want is the "simplest" variable that suits your purposes, rather than specifically the "smallest"
[12:32:53] <spudzee> that makes a lot of sense
[12:37:47] <nikio_> will this acces the note and importance fields of the JSon object?
[12:37:49] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/Lquedzz4/
[12:41:11] <robertmaxrees> dunno - what does the object look like?
[12:42:50] <bwarzeski> it should
[12:43:06] <bwarzeski> though you gave us a really weird snippet to determine that
[12:43:37] <robertmaxrees> really depends on the data that gets returned
[12:44:03] <bwarzeski> a json object in js translates to a dictionary.  if you define a js dictionary with keyword keys (not in quotes), then you can access its properties with . notation (i.e. todo.note)
[12:44:10] <robertmaxrees> *to an object.
[12:44:15] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't have dictionaries :)
[12:44:23] <robertmaxrees> err, jhavascript.
[12:44:35] <bwarzeski> however, if the json object returns string keys, I'm not sure how it would react
[12:44:50] <bwarzeski> oh, what name then?  I bounce back and forth between python and js too much
[12:44:54] <robertmaxrees> foo.bar is the same as boo['bar']
[12:44:59] <robertmaxrees> javascript just has object.
[12:45:03] <bwarzeski> shiny
[12:45:07] <bwarzeski> then yes, it should work
[12:45:13] <robertmaxrees> even arrays are objects, just special rules around the property names.
[12:45:31] <bwarzeski> provided you are getting a list of json objects which each have these two properties
[12:45:52] <robertmaxrees> also important: JSON is not javascript.
[12:46:44] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/6d9jss6a/
[12:46:48] <nikio_> the top is the client code
[12:46:54] <nikio_> server code
[12:46:57] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:46:59] <robertmaxrees> too much.
[12:47:21] <nikio_> well the json is there its not so long
[12:47:33] <robertmaxrees> didn't need anything else is what i'm saying.
[12:47:47] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:48:29] <robertmaxrees> you need todo[note]
[12:48:32] <robertmaxrees> err, wait...
[12:48:44] <robertmaxrees> todos[todo]note
[12:48:50] <robertmaxrees> * todos[todo].note
[12:49:35] <bwarzeski> or use underscore (  _.each(todos, function(todo) {});  )
[12:49:53] <bwarzeski> I tend to think it makes looping through collections much cleaner
[12:50:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6d9jss6a/1/
[12:50:03] <robertmaxrees> and safer
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> syntax error in that last example - should be http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6d9jss6a/2/
[12:51:23] <bwarzeski> that if .hasOwnProperty() is handled by _.each, ya?
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:51:42] <robertmaxrees> there's also a jquery $.each();, but I tend to avoid it.
[12:52:38] <robertmaxrees> some people like to nab the array of property names off an object and use forEach() against that instead.
[12:52:47] <robertmaxrees> and I get why, but it always feels funky.
[12:53:08] <bwarzeski> and looks ugly, but that's just personal preference
[12:53:12] <robertmaxrees> ^ aye
[12:53:18] <robertmaxrees> a little harder to read.
[12:53:53] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, thx
[12:53:55] <nikio_> but
[12:53:58] <nikio_> what is toDos.hasOwnProperty(toDo) ?
[12:54:11] <robertmaxrees> welcome to javascript inheritance.
[12:54:28] <robertmaxrees> if you're not careful, that for (var property in object) can include things in the prototype chain.
[12:54:29] <bwarzeski> makes sure  toDos still has that element
[12:55:01] <bwarzeski> oh, I thought it was for if arrays change length during looping.  nm
[12:55:02] <robertmaxrees> that can include things like methods and stuff that you don't care about.
[12:55:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> don't ever use for...in on arrays btw.
[12:55:33] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, so this is wrong?
[12:55:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:55:49] <robertmaxrees> hah - you're right.
[12:55:52] <nikio_> its a for in loop
[12:55:52] <robertmaxrees> misread that.
[12:55:59] <robertmaxrees> I didn't see that it was an array
[12:56:22] <nikio_> hmm so why not/
[12:56:23] <nikio_> ?
[12:56:28] <robertmaxrees> why not what?
[12:56:37] <nikio_> this loop is a for in loop right?
[12:56:46] <robertmaxrees> right - you shouldn't do that with arrays.
[12:56:55] <robertmaxrees> arrays have special rules for their properties.
[12:57:02] <nikio_> but toDos isnt an array?
[12:57:06] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[12:57:10] <robertmaxrees> i misread the code.
[12:57:18] <robertmaxrees> i incorrectly used a for...in loop.
[12:57:30] <nikio_> so what should be used instead?
[12:57:41] <robertmaxrees> a forEach()
[12:57:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6d9jss6a/3/
[12:58:15] <robertmaxrees> unless you need to support IE8 and below.
[12:58:20] <bwarzeski> ew
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> (I do, sooo...)
[12:59:37] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ sorry for confusing you :) been an interesting day
[13:00:01] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, thanks, but forEach doesnt work in IE8 ? ; <
[13:00:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:00:13] <robertmaxrees> if you have to support old IE, then you'd want to use an iterator.
[13:00:13] <nikio_> pff
[13:00:21] <nikio_> why do you need it robertmaxrees ?
[13:00:28] <robertmaxrees> need what?
[13:01:07] <nikio_> to support IE8
[13:01:22] <nikio_> maybe I need it too : <
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> my company has enough people using it that give us enough money to justify supporting it.
[13:01:29] <nikio_> i wanna be as professional as possible
[13:01:36] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[13:02:16] <nikio_> just a school toDo app.. but I actually plan on making it a general webhub thingy, where people can keep all kinds of important  things on the internet.. and access it from anywhere where there is a browser
[13:02:33] <nikio_> like a cloud office
[13:03:18] <nikio_> its just practice ofcourse, but I ike to thing big regardless ; ]
[13:03:21] <nikio_> *think
[13:03:29] <robertmaxrees> whether or not you need to support IE8 depends on a lot of factors.
[13:03:51] <robertmaxrees> it's not hard to support old IE, but it does take some forethought.  since you're just starting out, worry about getting everything working.
[13:04:03] <robertmaxrees> then fix up for old ie if you need to.
[13:04:07] <nikio_> ok
[13:04:28] <robertmaxrees> it's easy enough to do and doesn't hamper your current learning efforts.
[13:09:19] <jakery> woah nelly. cat nearly totalled my computer
[13:09:31] <jakery> i dont usually freak out, but when I do..
[13:10:13] <BillCriswell> jakery: My cat knocked over my old roommates brand new lap top. Smashed the fucking thing. Ran me like $500
[13:10:48] <jakery> yeah she almost ruined my 1300+ work mac
[13:10:48] <Guest72116> dang
[13:10:59] <jakery> and im thinking, i wouldnt be able to sell her organs to cover the cost..
[13:11:08] <BillCriswell> Haha
[13:11:51] <robertmaxrees> nah, the vet bills to harvest the organs would be too much.
[13:13:27] <jakery> yeah, plus I'm more likely to decorate them with lights and staple them to my roomates door anyway
[13:13:33] <jakery> I need a breather, damn
[13:13:45] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:14:23] <BillCriswell> That'd be hilarious in a movie.
[13:15:05] <BillCriswell> In real life no good obviously haha
[13:16:32] <zeroquake> anyone know about JQPLOT?
[13:16:37] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ zeroquake
[13:16:37] <b-ot> zeroquake: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:18:04] <zeroquake> reseting y axis , and i need to hide or show a line inside grpagh
[13:18:23] <zeroquake> does replot - make changes in the drawn graph?
[13:19:04] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ zeroquake
[13:19:04] <b-ot> zeroquake: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:19:10] <nikio_> im trying to understand this paragraph in the book: http://pastie.org/9787041
[13:19:22] <nikio_> why doesnt he just put the getJSON in the beginning of main?
[13:19:45] <nikio_> like this:  $.getJSON("gettodos.json", addTodosToList);
[13:19:56] <nikio_> and then the callback function would also be defined in main
[13:20:07] <robertmaxrees> nid two different scopes AND you probably want to run the ajax call inside of document ready
[13:20:11] <robertmaxrees> so the page is good to go.
[13:20:22] <zeroquake> i wish i could , i am fixing a bug in existing codebase, after breakpoints , i found out the problem is with replot method.
[13:21:12] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, so the getJSON and the callback function would both be in the scope of main
[13:21:13] <robertmaxrees> try to make a small example you can play with.
[13:21:19] <nikio_> whats the problem?
[13:21:22] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ and outside of the document ready call.
[13:21:39] <robertmaxrees> also, main is a callback of the getJSON call
[13:21:42] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, main will be called on document ready?
[13:21:49] <robertmaxrees> that's code that runs after the ajax has run.
[13:22:00] <zeroquake> yes, i am gonna try to do that , nevah used jqplot
[13:22:02] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, i know  but
[13:23:32] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ no but - it's one way to structure the code.
[13:23:58] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, this is what i ment? why wont this work just as well? http://jsfiddle.net/8bchckds/
[13:24:45] <robertmaxrees> that could work, too, though that's really hard to follow and read.
[13:25:05] <robertmaxrees> functions are goo.
[13:25:11] <robertmaxrees> *good.  use them.
[13:26:14] <robertmaxrees> there's probably a broader point they're working towards.
[13:26:21] <robertmaxrees> follow the style and worry about it after you're done.
[13:26:29] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, it actually doesnt work as expected : / only when i click on the tab will the json todo items show in my gui
[13:26:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:26:57] <robertmaxrees> I don't see any event bindings in the code you just shared.
[13:27:41] <nikio_> im not sure how best i can show u without pasting the whole code.. i have todos defined in my client code, and todos on the server, the clientside todos show when  the page loads, the server todos only show when i click on a tab, which thus causes the <ul> to fill up again
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:28:12] <robertmaxrees> none of that has anything to do with event bindings.
[13:28:19] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/pyzmceo9/
[13:28:22] <robertmaxrees> small, self-contained examples remove all the extra stuff that you don't need.
[13:28:23] <nikio_> thats the client code now
[13:29:13] <robertmaxrees> still not sure how any of this is relevant lol i'm very confused.
[13:31:38] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/pyzmceo9/1/  .. the todoitems retrieved with ajax from the server dont show when i load the page.. only the ones defined in the clientside code
[13:31:44] <nikio_> but when i click a tab they show
[13:31:57] <nikio_> which is strange because the ajax runs before the content gets constructed
[13:32:20] <nikio_> so the array of toDos should already have the new items from the JSON
[13:32:22] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to append things before the page is ready?
[13:32:50] <nikio_> maybe
[13:32:58] <robertmaxrees> (i'm not going to read the entirety of this file to figure out what you're doing)
[13:33:08] <nikio_> maybe thats why main should be the callback of the ajax function
[13:33:16] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:33:18] <robertmaxrees> i just explained this.
[13:33:25] <nikio_> to make sure all the JSON is retrieved
[13:33:34] <robertmaxrees> not sure "to make sure"
[13:33:40] <robertmaxrees> that's the only way you can guarantee it.
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> it's ajax - asyncronous
[13:33:52] <nikio_> yes thats why : ]
[13:33:54] <nikio_> thx now i get it
[13:34:28] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, so i must make the JSON array an argument to the main function right?
[13:34:45] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:34:48] <robertmaxrees> follow the tutorial.
[13:34:50] <nikio_> no other way
[13:35:13] <robertmaxrees> not without some really ugly wrangling.
[13:35:13] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:35:35] <nikio_>  http://pastie.org/9787041 robertmaxrees  u can see they forgot to explicitly mention it wont work because of the A in AJAX
[13:35:51] <robertmaxrees> that would work.
[13:35:52] <nikio_> they only say it depends on  it
[13:36:01] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:36:14] <robertmaxrees> follow the tutorial - stop worrying about those details for now.
[13:36:16] <robertmaxrees> be back in a bit.
[13:36:25] <nikio_> ok
[13:39:59] <beefman> what event would happen on a div inside an accordion child that would cause it to close when ajax replaces an item in that div?
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> back
[13:40:24] <robertmaxrees> beefman no clue.
[13:40:34] <robertmaxrees> we'd have to see the problem in action.
[13:40:45] <beefman> how can i monitor an object to see what events are happening on it?
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> you can't really.
[13:41:13] <robertmaxrees> object or DOM element?
[13:41:17] <beefman> dom el
[13:41:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah no real way.
[13:41:58] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it's not what you think it is though.
[13:42:02] <beefman> <div id="accordion"><h3><div><div id='foobar'> ...   when ajax replaces contents of #foobar, the accordion closes
[13:42:13] <beefman> how do you mean?
[13:42:15] <Danielss89> Hi
[13:42:34] <Danielss89> Why does .val("") on a textarea give an empty line? http://jsfiddle.net/2bjLJ/
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> beefman i'm going to guess you've got something doing a .trigger() or something similar.
[13:43:00] <robertmaxrees> Danielss89 huh?
[13:43:02] <beefman> lemme check
[13:43:16] <Danielss89> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/2bjLJ/ <-- try typing something and press enter
[13:43:20] <robertmaxrees> Danielss89 .val('') sets the contents of it to "nothing"
[13:43:29] <Danielss89> robertmaxrees exactly
[13:43:30] <robertmaxrees> that alert is annoying.
[13:43:36] <Danielss89> oh wait
[13:43:38] <robertmaxrees> that's on purpose...
[13:43:40] <Danielss89> forgot to update url
[13:43:52] <Danielss89> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/2bjLJ/58/
[13:44:19] <robertmaxrees> because you're dealing with a funky race condition
[13:44:34] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to clear when the user hits "enter"?
[13:44:43] <Danielss89> yeah
[13:44:47] <Danielss89> keyup instead?
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2bjLJ/59/
[13:44:53] <bwarzeski> robertmaxrees: so, are you jquery batman?
[13:45:00] <robertmaxrees> bwarzeski hahahahaha
[13:45:13] <robertmaxrees> nah, just the hero #jquery deserves
[13:45:27] <robertmaxrees> nah but foreal, i just have some experience.
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> and one of my objectives at work this year is to submit a PR to the jquery repo.
[13:46:24] <bwarzeski> oooooh
[13:53:11] <beefman> robertmaxrees: it's the ajaxSuccess event on the .ui-accordion-content divs
[13:53:28] <nikio_> how do i get an int value from a json object
[13:55:10] <robertmaxrees> beefman there you go.
[13:55:17] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ by accessing it.
[13:55:24] <beefman> next question...  how do i prevent it from closing the accordion?
[13:55:25] <robertmaxrees> ps it's just a number.
[13:55:38] <robertmaxrees> beefman what's in the ajaxSuccess event that's closing it?
[13:55:48] <beefman> nothing that i've added
[13:55:52] <nikio_> hmm i ran into some trouble its not sorting well. gna try to fix it now
[13:55:55] <robertmaxrees> beefman wut
[13:56:26] <robertmaxrees> beefman is it other code in your codebase?  oooorrrr...
[13:56:46] <beefman> i put $('#accordion .ui-accordion-content').on('ajaxSuccess', function() { console.log...} and it shows it's triggering on every child.
[13:56:57] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to close things.
[13:57:10] <beefman> none of my code is calling disable
[13:57:29] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[13:57:38] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean ajaxSuccess is...
[13:58:22] <robertmaxrees> unless you have code listening on that event, doing the close for you.
[14:06:15] <Merely_> Anyone here good at jQuery selectors?
[14:06:44] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Merely_
[14:06:45] <b-ot> Merely_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:06:45] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:06:57] <BillCriswell> Merely_: Ideally you shouldn't have to be a master selector.
[14:07:15] <Merely_> I'm wondering if this is vulnerable to XSS
[14:07:18] <Merely_> $(window.location.hash + ' .class');
[14:07:26] <robertmaxrees> :(
[14:07:31] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[14:07:47] <Merely_> I know it's bad practice, I just want to know if it's a vulnerability
[14:08:31] <Merely_> If not for the class string at the end, obviously it would be trivial to create HTML elements with it
[14:08:45] <Merely_> But can you add the element to the DOM from within the selector string?
[14:09:40] <robertmaxrees> have you tried?
[14:09:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:10:25] <Merely_> Yes
[14:10:49] <robertmaxrees> because you can.
[14:11:37] <jumpman> $('#someDiv :input')
[14:11:45] <jumpman> does this select all inputs within #someDiv?
[14:12:00] <Merely_> $('#someDiv input')
[14:12:07] <jumpman> http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[14:12:09] <robertmaxrees> all inputs, texareas, selects, and buttons, jumpman
[14:12:24] <jumpman> awesome, awesome. wasn't sure if the (pseudoselectors?) colon-led selectors worked the same
[14:12:27] <jumpman> thanks :3
[14:13:43] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[14:15:13] <LindsayM_> I'm trying to figure out how to animate the changing of an IMG attribute.. I thought it was going to be pretty basic but apparently it is not. I am using the scrollTop feature to get the position of the window and the code is qworking just fine but I wanted to animate between the two changes and can't seem to get it right http://jsfiddle.net/e2uxtk2v/2/
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> .prop('src', newUrl)
[14:16:16] <LindsayM_> OMG nevermind. CSS transition
[14:16:23] <robertmaxrees> k
[14:16:50] <LindsayM_> sometimes you have to ask the question to answer it youself it hink
[14:16:51] <LindsayM_> lol
[14:17:20] <robertmaxrees> yep
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> by vocalizing/typing it out, you're actually considering the problem differently.
[14:17:45] <robertmaxrees> rubber duck debugging.
[14:18:26] <LindsayM_> yep.
[14:18:33] <bwarzeski> :-D
[14:18:44] <bwarzeski> I have a skylander toy on my desk for just that purpose
[14:18:50] <yoelish> hi guys, this might not even be a jquery question per se, but... i have a div whose class is "content", and i set its content with this line of jquery:
[14:18:53] <yoelish> $('.content').mouseover(function() { $('.content').html(rc()); });
[14:19:12] <robertmaxrees> bwarzeski mine is an R2-D2
[14:19:23] <LindsayM_> i have my dogs in studio
[14:19:24] <yoelish> if i had a bunch of divs, would there be a way to use just one function to set the content of whichever one was moused over?
[14:19:25] <LindsayM_> and IRC :)
[14:19:40] <robertmaxrees> yoelish use $(this) inside of the handler
[14:19:45] <bwarzeski> ^
[14:19:56] <robertmaxrees> $(this).html(rc());
[14:19:57] <yoelish> thanks robertmaxrees :)
[14:20:02] <bwarzeski> the event is expecting you to pass the object triggering it
[14:20:03] <yoelish> i figured it was that or self
[14:20:06] <yoelish> but this qas quicker :P
[14:23:42] <nikio_> i used a custom sort function with the js .sort(foo())
[14:23:50] <nikio_> :] it sorts my objects
[14:24:16] <nikio_> ty  SO
[14:24:18] <robertmaxrees> you mean arrays?
[14:24:27] <nikio_> i guess so well no
[14:24:35] <nikio_> because its an array of ToDo objects
[14:24:48] <robertmaxrees> right - so you're sorting the objects in the array?
[14:24:51] <robertmaxrees> you can't sort objects.
[14:24:55] <nikio_> it sorts the Objects inside the array, i guess yould say i sort the array too
[14:25:07] <robertmaxrees> you're only sorting the array.
[14:25:42] <nikio_> hehehe, so what if you have a book shelf, you say you are sorting the shelf ? or sorting the books ? : D
[14:25:52] <robertmaxrees> bad analogy
[14:25:57] <robertmaxrees> you're working with an array.
[14:25:59] <robertmaxrees> not a book shelf.
[14:26:02] <nikio_> the shelf is the array the books the objects
[14:26:13] <robertmaxrees> "Sorting an array" means you're sorting the elements within the array.
[14:26:38] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort "The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array. "
[14:27:04] <nikio_> : ]
[14:27:33] <robertmaxrees> when you say "sort the array", you're saying "sort the items in the array"
[14:27:51] <nikio_> yes
[14:27:56] <nikio_> this is the function:
[14:27:57] <nikio_> function sortToDoImportance(a, b) {
[14:27:57] <nikio_>     return (a.importance - b.importance);
[14:27:57] <nikio_> }
[14:28:05] <robertmaxrees> please don't multiline paste into the channel.
[14:28:17] <nikio_> sorting the ToDos by importance
[14:28:19] <nikio_> ok sorry
[14:44:43] <jumpman> Is there a way that I can bind a different `this` value to $('something').change(fn)?
[14:45:38] <jumpman> would var that = this; $('something').change(fn.bind(that)) work?
[14:45:48] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:46:28] <jumpman> wow, it does
[14:46:28] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to change the element you're binding to?
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you can do that, but you're going to confuse a lot of people in the process?
[14:47:33] <jumpman> jquery decided .change should bind `this` to the element, which does make a lot of since. i'm not doing any operation on the bound element in this case
[14:47:38] <jumpman> it's actually kind of an interesting situation
[14:47:45] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:47:51] <robertmaxrees> right, `this` would be the element.
[14:48:07] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting it to be instead?
[14:48:17] <robertmaxrees> or are you calling other methods attached to an object?
[14:48:27] <jumpman> i've got a whole bunch of different input types being added to a div dynamically. the function i'm running now is just one that says "Hey, redo all of the filters, something changed."
[14:48:29] <jumpman> yep, that's it
[14:48:34] <robertmaxrees> ah, okay.
[14:48:37] <jumpman> just calling this.filter() xD
[14:48:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not necessarily a jquery problem.
[14:48:52] <robertmaxrees> that's more of a javascript thing.
[14:49:08] <jumpman> no, it really shouldn't be. i'm working with meteor, though, and templates/template instances for finding elements is miserable
[14:49:17] <robertmaxrees> invocation contexts.
[14:49:28] <robertmaxrees> you're calling something from within a function.
[14:49:36] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[14:50:06] <robertmaxrees> i've done similar things in the past - just make sure you're clear in your code, otherwise you'll convuse some folks.
[14:50:09] <robertmaxrees> *confuse
[14:54:19] <jumpman> this whole component is ending up more messy than I wanted
[14:54:40] <jumpman> it required much more knowledge of meteor's templates than i had going in to it
[15:04:14] <nikio_> $content.append($("<li>")).append($("<span>").text(toDos[i].toString()));
[15:04:21] <nikio_> here li is a sibling of span ?
[15:04:36] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:04:42] <nikio_> i would like it to be a child of li
[15:05:00] <robertmaxrees> then append to the li instead.
[15:05:12] <CapnKlutch> Does anyone know how to get the order of a list of an element after it has been sorted by jquery ui
[15:05:31] <robertmaxrees> nikio_  $content.append($("<li>").append($("<span>").text(toDos[i].toString())));
[15:05:43] <nikio_> yes i see now : ] thx
[15:08:43] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, i probably should just make a template and then clone, and use find to set the values.. this is gonna be the visual representation of a to do item, im gonna make it editable, and give it an x button to delete it, or a checkbox to tag it as done.
[15:50:06] <nikio_> heychu
[15:50:15] <nikio_> how come the buttons dont log to the console? http://jsfiddle.net/mf1fccae/3/
[15:51:09] <robertmaxrees> the Xs?
[15:51:22] <nikio_> yes
[15:51:33] <nikio_> lso the checkbox has logging as an action
[15:51:37] <nikio_> *also
[15:53:57] <robertmaxrees> oh because $deleteToDoButton isn't the element you want any more.
[15:55:08] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, how do you mean?
[15:55:29] <robertmaxrees> ;
[15:55:29] <robertmaxrees> console.log($deleteToDoButton);
[15:55:38] <robertmaxrees> after you do those appends.
[15:55:40] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[15:56:59] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/b4z6jsdy/
[15:57:24] <robertmaxrees> yes.  do you see the issue?
[15:57:47] <nikio_> nope : p
[15:58:02] <robertmaxrees> that's the reference to the old element, not the new one.
[15:58:06] <robertmaxrees> for whatever reason.
[15:58:11] <robertmaxrees> you should use a delegated listener anyway.
[15:58:57] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, hmm thats weird.. how do you see its the old one?
[15:59:23] <robertmaxrees> console.log() a visible element.
[15:59:27] <robertmaxrees> you'll see the distinction.
[16:02:05] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, well i see that $('body .content') logs much more attributes
[16:02:21] <nikio_> whats a delegated listener?
[16:03:13] <nikio_> do i have to change much on that code to make it work?
[16:03:18] <nikio_> im a bit confused
[16:08:48] <nikio_> does anyone know how to make the console.log() work for the buttons and the checkboxes?
[16:08:49] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/z0zpyzbh/3/
[16:09:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:09:55] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[16:10:00] <robertmaxrees> read the docs for .on()
[16:11:15] <nikio_> ok
[16:14:26] <nikio_> ok so what you mentioned earlier today basically
[16:14:58] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:15:03] <robertmaxrees> event delegation is hot shit.
[16:15:47] <nikio_> dec 17 17:47:38 <NoiseEee>	nikio_: you should really be assigning that listener outside of that.  $('tabs').on('click','button',function(){}) will catch all dynamically created buttons in your 'tabs' reference and send the particular button to the callback function
[16:16:01] <nikio_> i think that was it
[16:16:14] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:16:36] <robertmaxrees> that's a delegated listener.
[16:16:45] <nikio_> cool : ]
[16:21:13] <Omar-> Hi
[16:22:01] <Omar-> in widget factory, upon initializing the widget, how can user create a custom callback attached to dynamically created element(s)?
[16:22:41] <Omar-> for example $(".selector").mywidget({ "open", function () { do something } });
[16:23:33] <Omar-> nikio_ hi
[16:35:53] <nikio_> hi Omar- : ]
[16:39:23] <Omar-> nikio_ got it working?
[16:40:07] <nikio_> yep im working on getting these buttons to work
[16:40:07] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/z0zpyzbh/4/
[16:40:11] <nikio_> they r supposed to console log
[16:42:59] <Omar-> nikio_ this is wrong $deleteToDoButton = $("<button>").text("x");
[16:43:19] <nikio_> Omar-, why?
[16:43:28] <Omar-> should be $deleteToDoButton = $("<button>"); $deleteToDoButton.text("x");
[16:43:49] <nikio_> Omar-, nope it works
[16:43:51] <nikio_> check the result
[16:43:59] <nikio_> u see the x buttons?
[16:44:28] <nikio_> however, http://jsfiddle.net/z0zpyzbh/8/   line 15 doesnt work : /
[16:45:54] <Omar-> i know, you're changing text
[16:47:09] <Omar-> nikio_ http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/z0zpyzbh/9/
[16:47:23] <Omar-> you need to delegate events to dynamically created elements
[16:49:47] <nikio_> nope Omar http://jsfiddle.net/cb9fmvu0/2/
[16:49:55] <nikio_> i added  button instead , it works too
[16:50:06] <nikio_> i simply referenced the wrong class
[16:50:10] <nikio_> also line 18
[16:50:17] <nikio_> see it is one line less and it does the same
[16:50:32] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/cb9fmvu0/3/
[16:51:14] <nikio_> what did you change?
[16:51:14] <Omar-> yea true
[16:51:28] <Omar-> you missed a dot in .text
[16:52:17] <nikio_> Omar-, nope lol
[16:52:22] <nikio_> this is the original link http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/cb9fmvu0/3/
[16:52:24] <nikio_> the . is there
[16:52:41] <nikio_> *
[16:52:42] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/z0zpyzbh/4/
[16:53:17] <nikio_> anyway thanks ; ]
[16:53:26] <Omar-> welcome ;)
[16:55:51] <nikio_> Omar-, the problem now is to make the checkbox work the same way.. the change() function is different from a click event
[16:56:04] <nikio_>  $setDoneCheckbox.change(function() { ...
[17:01:42] <robertmaxrees> that's just a shortcut btw.
[17:01:50] <robertmaxrees> .on('change', function() {});
[17:05:39] <nikio_> ok robertmaxrees  this is  what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/z0zpyzbh/10/ now how can i associate a button with a todoobject in the arraylist? should i give each button an id in the for loop equal to the index i? that would correspond to the index of the todo  object in the array, so i could reference it and delete it.
[17:05:54] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:06:10] <robertmaxrees> you could use data attributes.
[17:07:11] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, on line 24, the for loop fills up the GUI with todo Items, using data from the toDos array, i could  give the buttons an id equal to i ..
[17:08:15] <nikio_> hmm
[17:08:47] <nikio_> noise said that the button would be passed in the callback
[17:10:12] <AcidRain2012> how can i format a date time object like this: 12/14/14, 1:00 am
[17:10:22] <AcidRain2012> 12/17/14, 1:00 am
[17:16:16] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ the button element IS passed in that event handler.
[17:16:30] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz using the javascript date object.
[17:19:03] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, hmm not workey.. i set the id attribute on line 28 but on line 16 it doesnt log it to console
[17:19:03] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/z0zpyzbh/13/
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> way too much going on in there.
[17:22:32] <robertmaxrees> first, set it on .prop()
[17:22:40] <robertmaxrees> not attr
[17:22:56] <robertmaxrees> 2nd, the issues is the event handler.
[17:23:07] <robertmaxrees> $(this), not $(event.delegateTarget)
[17:24:02] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, why prop not attr?
[17:24:57] <nikio_> ah
[17:25:02] <nikio_> prop can be of more types
[17:25:56] <robertmaxrees> prop is the actual property.
[17:25:58] <robertmaxrees> usually what you want.
[17:31:20] <rodux> hello?
[17:31:43] <robertmaxrees> ohai
[17:41:59] <robertmaxrees> well that was fun
[17:48:52] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, it almost works, but element 0 doesnt get deleted
[17:48:54] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/z0zpyzbh/21/
[17:49:27] <robertmaxrees> what line?
[17:50:24] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, line 15 is the event handler
[17:50:39] <nikio_> it splices the array based on the button prop id
[17:50:40] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use array.splice()
[17:51:00] <robertmaxrees> it needs 2 numbers.
[17:51:11] <robertmaxrees> first arg is the index to delete, second arg is how many elements.
[17:51:20] <nikio_> ah
[17:51:54] <AcidRain2012> what is javascripts am/pm called?
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:52:02] <AcidRain2012> why is that not an option
[17:52:09] <AcidRain2012> oh wait. i got an idea
[17:52:12] <robertmaxrees> with what?
[17:52:20] <AcidRain2012> u see :P
[17:52:27] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:54:46] <AcidRain2012> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/9nv74Q6S
[17:54:56] <AcidRain2012> ah
[17:55:00] <AcidRain2012> and theres an error in it. brb
[17:55:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/n06w2hgz/
[17:55:50] <robertmaxrees> and it's "meridian"
[17:57:31] <Robdgreat> in am/pm it is meridiem :)
[17:57:45] <Robdgreat> if it follows "prime" it's meridian
[17:57:55] <robertmaxrees> ah, I see what you're talking about.
[17:57:59] <robertmaxrees> the latin term.
[18:08:43] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, now when i click ALL buttons of my todo panel, the callback gets executed, how can i make sure certain buttons wont trigger the callback? whats the best way
[18:08:44] <nikio_> ?
[18:09:03] <robertmaxrees> not the right way to think about it.
[18:09:39] <robertmaxrees> what's the condition you're thinking of?
[18:10:09] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, well only buttons that are part of a todOitem should react,.. not the button which is part of the add new item tab
[18:10:27] <robertmaxrees> then your listener is bound to the wrong place.
[18:10:40] <robertmaxrees> bind it to the correct container instead.
[18:10:51] <nikio_> ok
[18:11:15] <nikio_> makes sense
[18:14:07] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, not really possible unless i give the spans an id attribute
[18:14:11] <nikio_> see the html
[18:14:12] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/z0zpyzbh/22/
[18:14:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:14:45] <nikio_> i should give the third span an id .. and check against it
[18:14:48] <robertmaxrees> bind to .content instead of .todolist
[18:14:57] <robertmaxrees> you don't need any IDs
[18:14:58] <nikio_> oh yeah
[18:15:06] <nikio_> i have content : ]
[18:15:17] <robertmaxrees> you still wouldn't need an ID.
[18:15:22] <robertmaxrees> you could just use a selector.
[18:15:32] <robertmaxrees> also you don't need body tags in jsfiddle.
[18:15:35] <nikio_> a selector ? o0
[18:15:53] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with CSS?
[18:17:17] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, yes.. btw the add panel is also part of content, so i must use a selector i guess
[18:17:27] <robertmaxrees> you're already using selectors here
[18:17:41] <robertmaxrees> $('.todolist') - that string is a selector.
[18:17:46] <nikio_> yes
[18:17:54] <robertmaxrees> you can use any CSS selector there.
[18:17:57] <nikio_> ohh
[18:18:01] <nikio_> easy  : ]
[18:26:29] <mikesm> I am using jquery-ui draggable. In the drop: function, I'm wondering how I can cancel the drop and return the element to its original position. I tried to just do a return statement in drop() but that causes the dragged element to just stop wherever it is when the return statement fires.
[18:26:35] <mikesm> How would I accomplish this?
[18:26:48] <rtpg> hey, is there a way to see all the callbacks registered for the ready event?
[18:27:32] <robertmaxrees> mikesm i'm not super familiar with jqui, but there's a cancel option.
[18:30:56] <nikio_> ;[  my array sorting function is messing up
[18:31:03] <nikio_> date sorting
[18:32:13] <nikio_> its the one on line 60 http://jsfiddle.net/2q98zvbg/
[18:34:25] <nikio_> im using it on lin126
[18:34:30] <nikio_> line 126
[18:36:57] <Woet> nikio_: please create a working demo on jsfiddle.
[18:37:17] <nikio_> Woet its getting complex : p
[18:37:26] <Woet> nikio_: what is getting complex?
[18:37:46] <nikio_> the code and ease of making a working demo
[18:38:13] <Woet> if you say so
[18:38:37] <Woet> if you don't want to make an effort into allowing us to debug it more easily, i won't put effort into debugging it.
[18:41:41] <nikio_> i want to, but im pushing myself to edges.. my brain is getting overloaded
[18:49:06] <nikio_> well it works
[18:54:30] <nikio_> Woet, is this ok? $toDoClone.find("<input type='checkbox'>").prop('checked', toDos[i].isActive());
[18:55:33] <Woet> nikio_: I don't know, does it cause an error?
[18:55:43] <nikio_> ye syntax
[18:57:24] <Woet> nikio_: no syntax error here.
[18:57:43] <nikio_> Woet, i needed $toDoClone.find("input[type=checkbox]").prop('checked', toDos[i].isActive());
[18:58:14] <Woet> nikio_: okay?
[19:42:34] <nikio_> is anyone good at jquery here?
[19:42:53] <nikio_> $(".content ul li").on("click", 'button', function() {  im  trying to add this listener  but i think it doesnt work
[19:43:10] <nikio_> maybe because ul li dont exist yet untill the document is generates?
[19:43:14] <nikio_> is that possible?
[19:43:21] <nikio_> Woet, ?
[19:44:26] <SirLagz> nikio_: wrap that in $(document).ready() and find out if it works after document generates ?
[19:45:07] <nikio_> SirLagz, complicated
[19:45:27] <SirLagz> how is that complicated ?
[19:45:35] <nikio_> because the jquery generates elements in main after getJSON gets json nd fills up the list
[19:46:03] <nikio_> main gets called by the callback of getJSON
[19:46:11] <SirLagz> so you're generating the 'ul li' after the document is ready ?
[19:46:12] <nikio_> which gets called by document ready
[19:46:16] <nikio_> yes
[19:46:37] <nikio_> $(document).ready(function() {
[19:46:38] <nikio_>     $.getJSON("gettodos.json", function(toDoObjects) {
[19:46:38] <nikio_>         main(toDoObjects);
[19:46:38] <nikio_>     });
[19:48:21] <SirLagz> nikio_: use deferred.then ? http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[19:49:07] <nikio_> hmm ok SirLagz ty
[19:54:13] <Conner05> My first log appears, but the second doesn't. I need that $.get() function to execute on load. It works on another page the js is included in, just not this particular one. What could be my problem? http://laravel.io/bin/d9v02#2,15
[20:47:00] <nikio_> how could I make this jquery line better?
[20:47:01] <nikio_> $toDotemplate.append($('<section>').append($('<span id=notelabel/>').text("Note: ")).append($('<span id="notetext"/>'));
[21:01:58] <ApplesInArrays> I'm using a LAMP stack. I have a set of JQuery selector strings which get the desired information out of a set of HTML files. Is there a way to make this a CRON job?
[23:32:48] <secrettriangle> Anyone here good with isotope?
