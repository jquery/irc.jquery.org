[00:11:59] <tweety> hai all.....i want to sign in with Twitter in jquery mobile app using cordova,i followed this link.https://rnd.feide.no/2012/08/01/oauth-2-0-with-phonegap-childbrowser-using-the-jso-library/.To Perform the protected OAuth calls what can i use as ajax url?
[00:12:59] <boomshaka> hi :)
[00:14:43] <boomshaka> i'm having troubles with jquery, i get a 404 error on pathtomylibfolder/jquery.min.map whatever i do ? get this error only in chrome console, firefox's console doesn't report any error
[00:15:15] <Cork> .map?
[00:15:29] <boomshaka> yes, .map :(
[00:15:36] <Cork> whats that?!?
[00:16:03] <boomshaka> i don't understand, really, i work on this project for several months, and it's the first time i see this error
[00:16:30] <boomshaka> i get the error in chrome console, not in firefox
[00:16:32] <thmzz> Hello! I have this site. http://www.glassfagkjeden.no/medlemmer/glassmestere/glass-i-nor-narvikglass-as and I want to add a link to the telephone numbers with jQuery. Can anyone guide me to what I should do?
[00:16:44] <Cork> boomshaka: you most likely should have jquery.mim.js there
[00:16:49] <Cork> not .map
[00:17:22] <Cork> thmzz: why don't you just link them in html?
[00:17:25] <boomshaka> i know, jquery.min.js loads fine, no problem, but this .map request is not fired by me
[00:17:39] <Cork> boomshaka: then find what is looking for it
[00:17:52] <Cork> boomshaka: it isn't a standard jquery file
[00:18:05] <thmzz> Cork: because it is impossible to find it in the PHP code.. its mosets tree in Joomla.
[00:18:24] <boomshaka> actually it a completly hand-written cms
[00:18:33] <boomshaka> i know every bit of code i wrote...
[00:18:38] <Cork> thmzz: it's most likely in the database
[00:18:58] <Cork> thmzz: though it should be fairly simple to search for it
[00:19:34] <Cork> grep -rn '<number>' .
[00:20:12] <Cork> or SELECT * FROM <content table> WHERE <content column> CONTAINS '%<number>%'
[00:20:28] <Cork> i mean.. fix it where it is instead of hacking around it
[00:20:56] <Cork> boomshaka: well apparently not, cause you have a file request that jquery would never do
[00:21:09] <Cork> s/file/resource/
[00:23:25] <boomshaka> Cork : see here a capture of the  error in the console, really i'm lost : http://hpics.li/3187f12
[00:23:59] <Cork> boomshaka: so check jquery-dotimeout-min.js
[00:24:20] <Cork> all i can tell you is jquery won't ever make that request it self
[00:24:22] <boomshaka> no, look, the error is reported on line 24
[00:24:42] <Cork> boomshaka: cause $.ajax is defined in jquery ya
[00:24:47] <Snerf> boomshaka, probably getting that error because the file doesnt exist
[00:25:02] <Cork> ...
[00:25:05] <boomshaka> the file js file exists, it's served
[00:25:06] <Cork> Snerf: really?
[00:25:15] <Cork> a 404 cause the file is missing?!? -_-'
[00:25:23] <boomshaka> good to be sure that jquery itself don't request this map file
[00:25:49] <Snerf> Cork, yes
[00:26:03] <Cork> Snerf: i was sarcastic
[00:26:10] <Snerf> Cork, I wasnt
[00:26:31] <Cork> the problem is where the request is comming from
[00:26:35] <boomshaka> ok, i also have to mention that everything works perfectly
[00:26:40] <Cork> not the error message per se
[00:26:53] <Cork> boomshaka: make a search through the code tree
[00:27:02] <Cork> you should be able to find something uses .map there
[00:27:38] <boomshaka> that's in chrome console ? never used this :S
[00:27:53] <Cork> boomshaka: no in the code tree
[00:28:01] <Cork> as in the file structure on the server
[00:28:23] <Cork> through ya, you should be able to search in the resources the browser has loaded
[00:30:18] <boomshaka> the file structure on the server ? i don't unserstand what you mean, sorry my english's a bit old… i repeat, i'm sure the js file is loaded, i'm sure that i never make any request to a .map file anywhere
[00:31:02] <boomshaka> if i remove a library, the error "moves" on another one, it's just crazy
[00:31:57] <boomshaka> i mean, i'm not a newbie, before i decide to open irc to ask a question, be sure i have watched every dumb error i could have made :(
[00:34:04] <boomshaka> and actually if the js file loading line is in the rendered page, it means my framework has already verified that the file exists
[00:34:37] <boomshaka> i'll become crazy, i don't even see what made this error come, i didn't change anything
[00:34:56] <boomshaka> and the most crazy part is that everything works perfect
[00:36:05] <boomshaka> see this other capture : http://hpics.li/9cc4bdc
[00:36:15] <boomshaka> you see the drop zones
[00:36:28] <boomshaka> they are generated by my jquery ui widget
[00:36:38] <boomshaka> this couldn't even work if jquery was not loaded
[00:36:49] <boomshaka> it uses the jquery ui widget factury
[00:36:57] <boomshaka> so i'm just lost
[00:36:59] <Cork> boomshaka: well in one way or another you are makeing the request to the server
[00:37:12] <Cork> else you wouldn't have the log saying the resource doesn't exist
[00:37:28] <boomshaka> i'm ok with that !
[00:37:38] <Cork> there are multiple ways you can back track to find where
[00:37:42] <boomshaka> i just miss knowledge of how to track this
[00:37:45] <Cork> one way is to just search for .map
[00:38:05] <Cork> another is to put a breakpoint in jquery.ajax and check the url there
[00:38:08] <boomshaka> you mean like a ctrl-f in the source files ?
[00:38:20] <Cork> and then backtrack in the stack to where it came from
[00:38:30] <Cork> boomshaka: no i mean like ex grep
[00:38:40] <Cork> ?g gnu grep
[00:38:41] <b-ot> Cork: grep - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF) → http://www.gnu.org/s/grep/
[00:38:50] <boomshaka> ok
[00:38:59] <boomshaka> why do you speak about ajax ?
[00:39:15] <Cork> boomshaka: cause that is the most likely source of the request
[00:39:26] <boomshaka> Oo
[00:39:52] <Cork> if you have a link it could prob be located fairly easy
[00:40:01] <boomshaka> you're right, i see the request in the xhr tab
[00:40:58] <boomshaka> weird
[00:42:30] <boomshaka> oooh that's a good one… in firefox, no error, no XHR request oO
[00:43:54] <Cork> ah
[00:43:57] <Cork> boomshaka: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17849006/hide-jquery-map-errors-in-google-chrome-developer-tools
[00:43:58] <boomshaka> no error in safari either
[00:44:30] <Cork> its for uglifier
[00:44:36] <Cork> *it's
[00:44:58] <boomshaka> haaaa
[00:45:02] <boomshaka> thank you !
[00:45:13] <boomshaka> though i still don't understand why the error gets fired
[00:45:18] <boomshaka> ^^
[00:45:34] <Cork> boomshaka: cause chrome dev tools detect the minified js file
[00:45:52] <boomshaka> oh ok
[00:45:53] <Cork> and tries to find a .map file to unminify the file
[00:46:00] <boomshaka> man !
[00:46:14] <boomshaka> that's good news :)
[00:46:20] <boomshaka> so many thanks
[00:46:27] <Cork> boomshaka: http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.map
[00:46:29] <boomshaka> wouldn't have ever found this
[00:47:29] <ph88> is it a problem if i set exactly the same event listener twice ? or do i need to check if it was already set ?
[00:47:47] <Cork> ph88: no they will both fire
[00:48:06] <ph88> aw that's not good :(
[00:48:28] <Cork> ph88: $().off('event').on('event', function() {})
[00:48:57] <doug65536> Cork: $() what context is that?
[00:49:06] <boomshaka> or you can check .data('events') too
[00:49:17] <Cork> doug65536: it means on a jquery selector
[00:49:20] <Cork> $('something')
[00:49:33] <Cork> doug65536: i just doesn't list what the function did
[00:49:36] <doug65536> Cork: lol, I know that. oh you meant something in there. got you
[00:49:38] <ph88> ok thx guys (not using jQuery events, but the principle is the same so i just asked that)
[00:49:42] <ph88> using backbone listenTo
[00:50:08] <Cork> ph88: well it will differ a lot if you don't use jquery
[00:50:20] <Cork> cause you won't have the off feature without it
[00:50:46] <ph88> ye but high changes are that if i set the listener twice it will be triggered twice ... so thx i know i have to investigate it
[00:51:13] <boomshaka> if ($.inArray(theCallback, $('theElement').data('events').theEvent) {
[00:51:14] <boomshaka> 	$('theElement').on('theEvent',theCallback);
[00:51:14] <boomshaka> }
[00:51:58] <boomshaka> though i forgot to "not" the test ^^
[00:52:01] <Cork> boomshaka: no need to overwork it like that
[00:52:38] <boomshaka> do you think off() makes less work ?
[00:52:59] <boomshaka> i'm always wondering this kind of things
[00:53:09] <Cork> boomshaka: it isn't much heavier, and leaves you with A LOT cleaner code
[00:53:27] <Cork> so the readability wins over the performance cost
[00:53:41] <boomshaka> true
[00:53:53] <Cork> and the fact that you do the element lookup twoce in your code
[00:54:00] <doug65536> boomshaka: are you going to be detaching/attaching events in a loop? I didn't think so :)
[00:54:01] <Cork> would actually cost more then the off() call
[00:54:32] <Cork> *twice
[00:54:35] <boomshaka> i actually don't do twice lookups when i code in real life ;)
[00:55:22] <boomshaka> but anyway you're right, simple is always better :)
[00:57:51] <doug65536> chrome uses linear search for getElementById http://jsperf.com/is-getelementbyid-linear-search/3
[01:01:23] <doug65536> it's 5 million lookups per sec vs 150 million lookups per second, so I can't complain :)
[01:01:46] <doug65536> s/150/15
[01:03:12] <Quietwalker> Using jqueryUI 1.10.3, accordion widget.  Using $().on(...) to associate a click event with an <a> in the header section.  This event will popup a yes/no confirmation box to delete this block.  The problem is this:  nothing I do inside that new click handler will stop that block from activating (expanding/contracting).
[01:03:57] <doug65536> Quietwalker: did you try event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault() (where event is the parameter to the callback)
[01:04:04] <Quietwalker> I've attempted to call event.stop[Immediate]Propoagation and preventDefault, and I can see the click order clearly goes:  accordion's beforeActivate, my new click handler, accordion's activate.
[01:05:00] <Quietwalker> I also set a global variable, 'cut_that_crap_out' which I toggle to true, and then check within the activate function, attempting to short circuit the accordion action with the same stop propoagation, etc
[01:05:09] <Quietwalker> plus both the click handler and that code block return false
[01:05:16] <Quietwalker> but I can't get it to stop expanding.
[01:05:33] <doug65536> Quietwalker: you could have mousedown and mouseup handlers. blocking those events would almost certainly work
[01:05:57] <Quietwalker> mmm.  That's a thought.  Sort of painful, but it makes sense
[01:06:33] <Quietwalker> I'm surprised there's no mechanism within the accordion widget to not activate the expansion dependent upon the activate event.
[01:06:53] <Quietwalker> or maybe it only works like that in the beforeactivate?
[01:06:58] <Quietwalker> probably so.
[01:07:05] <Quietwalker> activate is called afterwards.
[01:07:53] <doug65536> beforeactivate documentation says "Can be canceled to prevent the panel from activating"
[01:07:57] <Quietwalker> yeah.
[01:08:09] <Quietwalker> now I just need to figure out how to get my click handler in there prior to it firing.
[01:08:27] <Quietwalker> I'm using 'on' because these elements are dynamically created in the page
[01:08:37] <Quietwalker> add, and as I just mentioned, delete ...
[01:09:10] <Quietwalker> I'd rather not have to separately attach a click handler each time ... the event the on() handler is getting IS different from that which the accordion is getting.
[01:09:17] <Quietwalker> target is different, etc.
[01:09:18] <Quietwalker> hmm
[01:09:23] <Quietwalker> Let me try that though.
[01:09:40] <Quietwalker> otherwise I'll just rewrite the accordion widget. :)
[01:09:41] <Quietwalker> heh
[01:09:59] <doug65536> Quietwalker: I would expect mouseup/down to fully propagate before click can happen
[01:10:50] <Quietwalker> doug2^16: yup, but if I attempted to cancel the event propagation in the other one, I don't expect it to work here either.
[01:11:22] <Quietwalker> rather ... I DID attempt it, and it didn't change the behavior
[01:14:22] <boomshaka> quietwalker : that <A> triggers both accordion opening and popup opening ?
[01:16:00] <fluffypony> question: can I use .get() to only fetch a specific div? As in $.get("blah.html #maindiv")? doesn't seem to work in testing, but I may be doing something wrong
[01:16:52] <Quietwalker> boomshaka: yes, and when I check the event firing sequence, it's accordion beforeActivate, my click handler, then accordion activate.  I'm currently registering the onclick handler as an 'on' event, attached to a parent of the header objects - the header objects are dynamically created and/or destroyed, so I can't do it right on them without ... messy code :)
[01:17:14] <boomshaka> $('#maindiv').get() ?
[01:17:14] <Quietwalker> boomshaka: like adding the onclick handler association within the accordion row creation event.
[01:17:26] <boomshaka> ok i understood :p
[01:17:56] <boomshaka> (of subject, but for dynamically attached handlers, look at jquery delegate, it's really nice)
[01:17:58] <fluffypony> boomshaka: but then the selector applies to the current DOM, not the DOM returned by get?
[01:18:46] <Quietwalker> boomshaka: I'm actually using .on() to attach the onclick handler ...
[01:19:17] <Quietwalker> boomshaka: on() is the new hotness, delegate is old pos :)
[01:19:19] <boomshaka> but you have to do it again when an element is added, delegate avoids that
[01:19:30] <Quietwalker> no. On does all that.
[01:19:35] <boomshaka> oh
[01:19:42] <Quietwalker> That's why I'm using it
[01:19:47] <boomshaka> really oO
[01:19:50] <Quietwalker> yup
[01:19:59] <Quietwalker>         $("#outer_product_wrapper").on("click", ".title_block .title_commands a.delete", function (event) { ...});
[01:20:01] <Quietwalker> something like this
[01:20:04] <Quietwalker> however
[01:20:13] <Quietwalker> the click handler there is on the outer element right?
[01:20:33] <Quietwalker> so the top-most element, the actual header, gets the click handler first before it propagates back to the parent element.
[01:21:14] <Quietwalker> I need my click handler to get it before the accordion click handler - can't be done with delegation like this using On, because it's always a parent element that needs to wait for propagation
[01:21:18] <Quietwalker> which bites, but *Shrugs*
[01:21:28] <boomshaka> use capture ?
[01:21:33] <Quietwalker> what's capture?
[01:21:40] <boomshaka> capture phase of the event
[01:21:56] <boomshaka> happens before bubbling
[01:22:05] <Quietwalker> ah, that's not IE friendly, according to google.
[01:22:10] <Quietwalker> I need it to work everywhere :)
[01:22:16] <boomshaka> ok
[01:22:26] <boomshaka> you could also do a very dirty thing
[01:22:38] <boomshaka> but that's dirty ^^
[01:22:48] <Quietwalker> I considered going in and sorting the attached event handlers, but ... that's messy, even more so than just calling the click handler once on each item as it's generated.
[01:22:51] <boomshaka> get the delete button out of the accordion dom
[01:23:10] <Quietwalker> I mean, in the end, it's just an array of events, easy to stick my own in there ...
[01:23:56] <boomshaka> erf i need to test make a test page, i remember having done something like this
[01:28:46] <boomshaka> ok, just to be sure, Quietwalker : http://hpics.li/3166b0f
[01:29:00] <boomshaka> you want the a not to open the accordion, that's it ?
[01:29:01] <Quietwalker> yep
[01:29:08] <Quietwalker> and I can do it with a standard click handler
[01:29:17] <boomshaka> in my capture, the dom is correct ?
[01:29:18] <Quietwalker> as long as I register it before the accordion-ing.
[01:29:19] <Quietwalker> yep
[01:29:22] <Quietwalker> that's right.
[01:29:28] <boomshaka> ok
[01:29:30] <Quietwalker> it's just that I can't do it with a delegation :(
[01:30:00] <boomshaka> mmh ok, so what would be your handler registering code for my example ?
[01:30:26] <boomshaka> first i set the accordion, and then the click handler ?
[01:30:40] <Quietwalker> it'd be something like $("#accordion").on("click","h3 a", function(event) { ....});  prior to the accordion loading.
[01:31:03] <boomshaka> ok, let's test that crap :)
[01:31:03] <goop> hey guys, what is a way i can rearrange an item to be first within a list, i thought i could use insert after a div, but i realize I want it to be inserted first within a di
[01:31:05] <goop> div
[01:31:06] <Quietwalker> but if you watch the sequence of events, it'll always send the event to the topmost element first. :)
[01:31:06] <goop> which it won't do
[01:31:38] <goop> like imagine <div><div></div><div></div></div>
[01:31:55] <goop> how would i put the second internal div first, imagine a bigger list of divs inside though
[01:31:57] <gonnarule> hi all
[01:31:57] <boomshaka> prepend
[01:32:08] <goop> and the first internal div has no specia label
[01:32:24] <goop> ah ok boomshaak i think thats what i'm looking for
[01:32:28] <boomshaka> goop : container.prepend()
[01:32:33] * Quietwalker nods.
[01:33:51] <gonnarule> question : website is giving me jquery error : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined (like an object is undefined at the time I call some method), but, when I copy/paste the website code into jsfiddle, it works. I use the same jquery library,all should be the same, but still...
[01:34:55] <Quietwalker> gonnarule: chances are the <script> tag you use to include the code is wrong, or somehow being blocked -
[01:35:26] <Quietwalker> I often had that problem when I had a plugin in firefox called noscript, and I didn't put an exception for my local machine (localhost, specifically)
[01:35:34] <Quietwalker> so it wouldn't load my library properly :)
[01:35:46] <Quietwalker> but it worked magically when I put it on the hosting site.  Took me a while of brain-deadness to figure out
[01:36:13] <Quietwalker> also, depending on the browser, it may disable javascript when accessing html pages from a file:/// handler
[01:36:55] <gonnarule> well, yesterday code was working, then I worked all day in jsfiddle, uploaded, and bam
[01:37:13] <Quietwalker> Ah, that's interesting.  What does the console say when you load the page?
[01:37:18] <Quietwalker> no problems?
[01:37:40] <gonnarule> nothing on load
[01:37:52] <Quietwalker> I often sit down in the console and start typing the various javascript that I'm expecting to run  piecemeal, one bit at a time, to figure out exactly where it's failing
[01:37:55] <gonnarule> but if I try to validate my form, error
[01:37:59] <Quietwalker> *nods*
[01:38:00] <Quietwalker> hmm
[01:38:25] <Quietwalker> I'm guessing that the fiddle version isn't exactly the same as your work copy
[01:38:41] <Quietwalker> ~somehow
[01:38:45] <gonnarule> will search... :)
[01:38:51] <Quietwalker> *nods*
[01:39:02] <Quietwalker> javascript needs a really good debugger ^^;
[01:39:16] <Quietwalker> too bad all the current options are like ripping your fingernails off
[01:39:31] <gonnarule> btw it's the method .valid() from jquery validate plugin which cause problem
[01:39:35] <gonnarule> in console
[01:40:01] <Quietwalker> hmm.  Sometimes plugins have their own issues that are hard to diagnose.
[01:40:41] <Quietwalker> Forget to define all the columns in jquery.datatable, for example, and you'll get an error like you found complaining about something being undefined null pointer exception, in what appears to be unrelated code.
[01:41:07] <ph88> how can i use a variable like to point to a object property?   http://jsfiddle.net/fYUU3/
[01:41:15] <boomshaka> QuietWalker : in the beforeActivate handler, you can check the "toElement" property of the event
[01:41:37] <Quietwalker> I'm not familiar with the validate plugin, but could be it that some piece of syntax or ... however you decorate the elements that need validation -  is slightly off?
[01:41:41] <Quietwalker> i'd check that :)
[01:41:50] <boomshaka> if it's an a
[01:41:50] <Quietwalker> boomshaka: ooh, really? Lemme check that.
[01:42:00] <boomshaka> if it's an A, prevent default
[01:42:12] <ph88> nvm got it, array notation with []
[01:42:26] <gonnarule> [key]
[01:42:41] <boomshaka> well, if it's an a or if it has the class of your delete button or whatever you want
[01:42:48] <Quietwalker> yeah, i getcha
[01:42:52] <Quietwalker> lemme check
[01:43:28] <Quietwalker> hmm
[01:43:41] <Quietwalker> the 'toElement' field is undefined in the event.
[01:44:13] <boomshaka> strange i have it ! some properties of events are not cross browser :(
[01:44:25] <Quietwalker> I'm randomly using firefox
[01:44:46] <Quietwalker> but I have to switch between firefox, ie 7-9, and chrome
[01:44:55] <Quietwalker> at least no ie 6.
[01:44:56] <Quietwalker> heh
[01:45:08] <boomshaka> ok
[01:45:21] <boomshaka> i'm sure there's a solution, intersting problem, will search more :)
[01:45:35] <boomshaka> sad, because in chrome with toElement it was easy :D
[01:45:37] <Quietwalker> I think for now, I'll just be lazy and do a mass unbind("click") and rebind.
[01:45:42] <Quietwalker> though technically that's lazy
[01:45:49] <Quietwalker> I mean, super lazy =D
[01:46:15] <Quietwalker> actually wait, n/m, I'll just associate it when I create it. Duh, I've got the dom before I associate it with the page.
[01:46:47] <boomshaka> and the target of originalEvent of event ?
[01:46:51] <boomshaka> should work
[01:46:55] <goop> hey can i activate two functions for onClick when i need to pass values
[01:47:00] <Quietwalker> originalEvent is undefined :(
[01:47:19] <Quietwalker> goop: yes, you can add as many onclick handlers or call as many functions within one as you'd like.
[01:47:25] <boomshaka> ?? i get it in firefox
[01:47:29] <goop> how do i put two together, when they need to pass values
[01:47:32] <boomshaka> originalEvent's always defined
[01:47:43] <goop> like i already have one onclick=fun(var,var1)
[01:47:47] <goop> how would i add another one to it
[01:47:52] <Quietwalker> you mean in the html?
[01:47:57] <goop> yeah
[01:48:27] <goop> or if i dont do it through html, can i still pass values?
[01:48:42] <Quietwalker> depending on how you want to do it, I've been known to be lazy with event propagation and stuff before and do something like this:  onclick="function1() && function2_only_if_function_one_works()"
[01:48:49] <Quietwalker> or you can just use semicolons :)
[01:49:16] <Quietwalker> onclick="func1(); func2();" - but of course, then function 2 needs to return true or false to determine if the click still 'goes through'
[01:49:22] <Quietwalker> and 1 is ignored.
[01:49:29] <Quietwalker> hmm
[01:49:51] <goop> hm, seems kinda messy
[01:49:55] <xqo> goop do $.each() for all the clickable elements and bind .click or whatever.
[01:49:58] <Quietwalker> yup
[01:50:06] <goop> i need to pass values though
[01:50:13] <goop> can i do that with .each?
[01:50:14] <boomshaka> Quietwalker : beforeActivate: function(e){ console.log(e.originalEvent.target); }, works for me on chrome, firefox, safari, (don't have IE under hand)
[01:50:44] <Quietwalker> but otherwise, the onclick handlers just get an event, no values.  A common solution for this though is using non-standard attributes, like 'data-val' on your element.
[01:50:52] <goop> ok ill try looking for online tutorials about it
[01:51:04] <Quietwalker> then just do (event.target).attr("data-val")
[01:51:08] <Quietwalker> in your click handler
[01:51:22] <Quietwalker> there's even a jquery data plugin somewhere that makes it even easier
[01:51:32] <Quietwalker> formalizes the data structure in those attributes
[01:51:36] <xqo> goop http://hastebin.com/maqifanuwe.js
[01:52:33] <goop> xqo: hastebin..?
[01:52:51] <nbros652> Can anyone here tell me if it's possible to disable input in a text field without setting the disabled attribute? I still want it to respond to click, and the disable attribute kills that.
[01:53:11] <xqo> goop?
[01:53:12] <Cork> nbros652: readonly
[01:53:20] <goop> link doesnt wokr
[01:53:40] <xqo> goop http://hastebin.com/raw/maqifanuwe
[01:53:43] <nbros652> Cork: thank you ... I was having one of those duh moments.
[01:54:07] <gonnarule> jQ("#form").validate().form in console gives me the function(){} definition
[01:54:25] <gonnarule> jQ("#form").validate().form() gives me the typeerror
[01:55:34] <boomshaka> have to go, bye :) you should really test that event.originalEvent.target in IE, Quietwalker ;)
[01:56:17] <xec_> is code.jquery.com down or is it just me?
[01:56:39] <gonnarule> xec works to me
[01:56:42] <boomshaka> + that, but i doubt it's usefull…  : if(jQuery.inArray("originalEvent", jQuery.event.props)==-1) jQuery.event.props.push("originalEvent");
[01:56:47] <Cork> xec_: just you
[01:57:27] <boomshaka> thanks again Cork for the help ! bye :)
[01:58:12] <seutje> gonnarule: what exactly is the type error? do you happen to have checkboxes/radios without a name attribute?
[01:58:29] <seutje> or a form inside your form
[01:58:41] <Cork> yay that is a funny one :D
[01:59:03] <Cork> (especially if you have partial files you include and then don't understand why everything blows up :D )
[01:59:29] <gonnarule> seutje I use struts, so all radio/checkboxes have properties attr, which are transformed to name normally (will check). The error is : TypeError ; Cannot call method 'call' of undefined when I call "jQ("#form").valid()"
[01:59:54] <seutje> oh... missing a callback?
[02:00:20] <gonnarule> seutje I don't know, fact is code is working in jsfiddle
[02:00:51] <seutje> o.O
[02:00:57] <gonnarule> yep..
[02:01:01] <seutje> that usually means something is running too soon
[02:01:10] <seutje> cause jsfiddle wraps it in a window load
[02:01:42] <gonnarule> yes, but I don't know what.. :)
[02:02:20] <seutje> break & step through, checking return values of all the things?
[02:03:06] <gonnarule> will do that, but I'm not familiar to debugging tools for JS. Like how to breakpoint + check variables
[02:03:30] <gonnarule> (I'm under chrome, using js console)
[02:03:47] <doug65536> gonnarule: if you use chrome, press f12, go to sources tab, click the little stop sign icon at the bottom until it is purple
[02:03:59] <doug65536> gonnarule: it will break into debugger at first uncaught exception
[02:04:04] <seutje> put "debugger;" in your code, refresh with the console open, when it pauses, you can type stuff in the console and it will be run where the parser is at that time
[02:04:15] <doug65536> gonnarule: then you can check values in console or by mouseover
[02:04:24] <seutje> also, in the sources tab, you can see a breakdown of the scopes and variables and their value on the right
[02:05:19] <seutje> or set it to break on all errors and try to see what it's trying to run call on and where it was supposed to come from
[02:05:23] <doug65536> gonnarule: one good trick is evaluating selectors in the console, like $('#form') and see what you get
[02:07:08] <gonnarule> doug65536 did that, I know how to get the TypeError, but my selectors seems fine
[02:07:19] <gonnarule> just the call of the ".valid()" breaks
[02:07:27] <Syrit> Hello guys, i have some noob quistions, i hope i will not be annoying any one.
[02:07:57] <Syrit> 1- so, Json, is a way to send data from my backend serve to the frontend (browser) right?
[02:08:10] <gonnarule> and btw, I'm in Sources in Chrome, clicked the "pause" icon at the bottom, and it's going to jquery-1.8.2.min.js file with a red arrow in the code line. Did not even click a button
[02:08:13] <seutje> gonnarule: and you're certain the files you're including in the fiddle are exactly the same?
[02:08:26] <doug65536> Syrit: you are thinking of it backward. it is a way for your front end to ask the server for something
[02:09:23] <Syrit> ha, i see doug65536 , actually i wanted to populate a select tag, with list stored in my Backend, so i wrote an application helper to convert this list to json , and send it to the browser :)
[02:09:31] <doug65536> Syrit: ajax is a way to say, "hey browser, pretend the user put this in the address bar, tell me what the response would be"
[02:10:02] <doug65536> Syrit: that's a simple way to think about it
[02:10:08] <Syrit> i see...
[02:10:30] <Syrit> so, json goes under "ajax" title ?
[02:10:47] <doug65536> Syrit: json is a way of taking objects and turning them into text
[02:10:57] <Syrit> right, i see  this ..
[02:11:01] <gonnarule> seutje : we use 1.8.2 and jsfiddle is 1.8.3, and by mistake I use (will be changed) plugins "normal" version, when jsfiddle use .min versions
[02:11:03] <doug65536> Syrit: and taking text and turning them back into objects
[02:11:03] <Syrit> i don't see where is ajax though :D
[02:11:44] <seutje> gonnarule: odd, usually minified version is more problematic
[02:11:47] <doug65536> Syrit: "normal" responses are html. when you do ajax, it could be an html response, or it could be json
[02:12:03] <Syrit> oh, i see
[02:12:15] <doug65536> Syrit: if you want to ask the server for information, you usually want it to send you json, so it's easy to work with on the client side in js
[02:13:16] <Syrit> exactly doug65536 , that was the second part of my question, i have the json now, and i want to know how can i use JQuery to handle it, and popluate a select tag with it ..it's my very first time using jQuery
[02:13:23] <doug65536> Syrit: you ask for a url, and optionally add GET parameters, or you can to a POST. the response is whatever the server sends back. that is determined by what is done on the server side. if the server sends back json, you can have it converted back to objects for you
[02:14:00] <DarsVaeda> is there a function to turn a url param string into something useable like "?foo=bar&bar=foo"
[02:14:36] <Cork> DarsVaeda: that is a param string
[02:14:52] <Cork> so what are you talking about turning it from?
[02:15:02] <doug65536> DarsVaeda: do you mean extract it from a url?
[02:15:07] <DarsVaeda> not from into
[02:15:10] <gonnarule> how can I copy a scope variable value in chrome Sources ?
[02:15:14] <gonnarule> using debugging ?
[02:15:37] <DarsVaeda> I have "?foo=bar..." and need an array or object so I can access "foo" and get "bar"
[02:15:40] <doug65536> Syrit: see $.get or $.post (both of those are simple to use) or the fully flexible and more difficult $.ajax
[02:15:55] <Cork> DarsVaeda: ok, so you mean you want to split a param string
[02:16:11] <DarsVaeda> probably yes :)
[02:16:13] <doug65536> Syrit: if you pass 'json' as the last parameter to $.get or $.post, your callback will receive an object already decoded from json for you
[02:17:35] <Cork> DarsVaeda: there are a few plugins for spliting params strings
[02:17:54] <Syrit> okay doug65536  , can you please give me some hints, on what keywords should i use when googling, i want to populate a select tag with the json i have available to my "window.myVar" variable
[02:18:07] <DarsVaeda> yes I find plenty but they always use the location and some regex I do not understand
[02:18:32] <Cork> DarsVaeda: or you could simply do something like $.map(.split('&'), function(v) { return [v.split('=')] })
[02:19:06] <DarsVaeda> I'll try that thanks
[02:19:26] <doug65536> Syrit: I did. $.getJSON is easiest to use one
[02:19:32] <Cork> DarsVaeda: here's another example https://gist.github.com/kares/956897
[02:19:33] <doug65536> Syrit: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[02:19:42] <Syrit> oh, okay, thank you so much for that doug65536
[02:19:46] <doug65536> Syrit: I'll write you a simple fiddle
[02:19:47] <smartgloves> sup
[02:20:00] <Syrit> oh my , that would be really nice, thank you so much doug65536
[02:20:45] <Cork> DarsVaeda: or https://github.com/rapportive-oss/jquery-parsequery
[02:32:06] <Syrit> i think i did it other way around doug65536 , i wrote a small helper in rails, (and without any request) this helper fetches an array of the my model and converts it to json ,and sends it to the broswer to be availabe to my window.Variable ..
[02:34:43] <doug65536> Syrit: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/RS3sW/
[02:35:00] <doug65536> demo uses ajax to get some public gists from github and puts links in the page
[02:35:42] <doug65536> line 8 gets the json already decoded into an object at line 8
[02:36:29] <doug65536> each goes through each one and appends a url, with the link in this.html_url and the description in this.description. in this case, the json is an array of objects
[02:37:57] <Syrit> i see, Thank you doug65536 , i understand now how this works...
[02:38:04] <doug65536> Syrit: np
[02:38:38] <Syrit> so, now instead of $.getJSON(from url) i will specify that i want my json objects to be fetched from my "window.var" right ?
[02:39:04] <mazzachre> I have a problem with .offset(coords)  function... First time I call it on an element it works nicely, second time, it will add the offsets apparently, so the element will be moved away from where I want it... It is an absolute placed element...
[02:39:06] <Cork> O_o
[02:39:31] <Cork> Syrit: no you don't use getJSON to parse variables in the page
[02:39:31] <doug65536> Syrit: if you already have json as a string, you use var my_object = $.parseJSON(my_string);
[02:39:49] <Syrit> oh, okay !
[02:40:01] <Cork> Syrit: also if you already have it in page, why have it as json and not just plain js objects?
[02:40:22] <Cork> "{}" json => {} js
[02:40:45] <Syrit> i don't know Cork ,
[02:41:18] <Syrit> i had them sent from the server, to the window.Var , and i want to populate a select tag with them .that's it
[02:41:27] <doug65536> Syrit: how did that data get into the window object?
[02:41:33] <doug65536> .var
[02:41:44] <Syrit> i told you doug65536  i wrote a helper in rails
[02:42:00] <Syrit> return SalesReps.all.to_json
[02:42:04] <Cork> Syrit: that isn't really an answer
[02:42:17] <Cork> Syrit: how is that ruby code getting the string into js?
[02:42:34] <Cork> that is where you should fix the problem
[02:42:57] <aaronmcadam> test
[02:42:57] <Syrit> in my html.haml page, i wrote this :
[02:42:58] <Syrit> :javascript
[02:42:58] <Syrit>   window.sales_reps = #{ json_for @sales_reps, each_serializer: SalesRepSerializer }
[02:42:58] <Syrit>   console.log(sales_reps)
[02:43:07] <aaronmcadam> test
[02:43:24] <doug65536> aaronmcadam: ack
[02:43:30] <seutje> anyone have any idea why FF is stripping spaces in between attributes when using .innerHTML?
[02:43:35] <Syrit> lol doug65536
[02:44:02] <Cork> Syrit: hmm well somewhere you dubble encode the json
[02:44:05] <spobat> hey
[02:44:17] <aaronmcadam> hi
[02:44:19] <Cork> Syrit: you get a json string, and then you encode that into a javascript string
[02:44:23] <spobat> any idea what is wrong here? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6559846/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-21%20at%2011.43.49%20AM.png
[02:44:27] <spobat> it looks weird to me :O
[02:44:28] <Cork> Syrit: that second encoding is what you want to avoid
[02:44:34] <Syrit> no no , the json_for is another helper to dertimine which serialzer to use Crok
[02:44:40] <spobat> there is no "min.map" in any of my projects i'm aware of
[02:44:55] <Cork> Syrit: if you need to run parse in json, then yes that is what happens
[02:45:09] <Cork> Syrit: else you would have objects in sales_repos
[02:45:10] <Syrit> you can say i use :javascript
[02:45:10] <Syrit> <Syrit>   window.sales_reps = #{ sales_rep_json()} and it does the same
[02:45:14] <Cork> adn no need to parse it
[02:45:24] <Cork> Syrit: else you would have objects in sales_repos
[02:45:33] <Cork> so you MUST do dubble encoding
[02:45:34] <mazzachre> http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/zYCYs/ <- moving the mouse in and out of the green and red squares will show what I mean...
[02:45:45] <mazzachre> Is this a bug? Or what is the meaning?
[02:46:04] <Syrit> i am confused now Cork , let me send you gist
[02:46:14] <aaronmcadam> test
[02:46:25] <Cork> aaronmcadam: stop it
[02:46:34] <aaronmcadam> I'm not doing it on purpose twat
[02:46:39] <Cork> aaronmcadam: if you need to test use a different channel
[02:46:40] <aaronmcadam> my client was wonky
[02:46:46] <aaronmcadam> nevermind it's done now
[02:46:53] <doug65536> mazzachre: offset tells you distance from top left of document. try position()
[02:46:55] <Cork> aaronmcadam: no need to test it in the live channel
[02:47:04] <aaronmcadam> nm too late now
[02:48:09] <Cork> mazzachre: what part is it you want to ask about?
[02:48:25] <mazzachre> doug65536: But should setting the same offset twice in a row not give the same result?
[02:48:28] <Cork> mazzachre: make sure to explain the problems else ppl have to guess at what part you don't intend
[02:49:09] <mazzachre> Cork: Why is the element being offsetted to the offset of the other element being moved further and further away as it is drawn many times?
[02:49:10] <doug65536> mazzachre: now it jumps 40 pixels per iteration http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/zYCYs/1/
[02:49:20] <Syrit> here it is Cork , doug65536  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e68432cb1cce6d19e8ed
[02:49:31] <gonnarule> ok.. I have more infos on my error (thanks debugging) : I use validate and additional-methods to validate forms. Bug is occuring when trying to call "valid" of the "lettersonly" method, which seems undefined in the actual js. Which is odd, because I load the library
[02:50:35] <mazzachre> doug65536: Yes and the further from the top corner you place it, the further it will jump... But if you move the mouse out from the window and do it again, it will move back to on top of the square..
[02:50:47] <Cork> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/zYCYs/2/
[02:51:37] <gonnarule> ok my bad, 2 differents theme and one did not have the additional-methods.js file :)
[02:51:42] <mazzachre> Cork: Yes, that was also my solution, but why does offset(coords) not work as expected? This gives problem with jQueryUI.position since it apparently uses offset (It shows the same behaviour)
[02:52:06] <mazzachre> Cork: And it can be done even easier by just using .css(elem.offset());
[02:52:10] <Cork> mazzachre: i'm reading the docs right now
[02:52:18] <Cork> mazzachre: never set offsets that way before
[02:53:02] <mazzachre> Cork: No, neither have I, I just explored why jQueryUI.position(obj) failed me like it does
[02:53:39] <Cork> mazzachre: i've used offset and position as getters, never setters
[02:54:54] <Cork> mazzachre: aha
[02:55:20] <Cork> mazzachre: hmm... no...
[02:55:49] <mazzachre> Cork: hmm, lol
[02:56:50] <Cork> hmm
[02:56:53] <Cork> ( options.top - curOffset.top ) + curTop
[02:56:58] <Cork> ( options.left - curOffset.left ) + curLeft
[02:57:52] <Cork> hmm that should be correct...
[02:58:00] <Cork> breakpoint time!
[02:58:41] <seutje> oh man, when using innerHTML on the parent of an inline SVG element in FireFox does some funky shit to the markup
[02:59:03] <seutje> every attribute starting with an "x" seems to get its preceding space stripped
[03:00:11] <doug65536> mazzachre Cork  look at this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/zYCYs/10/
[03:01:22] <boytoy> Hi, does anybody know why Trunk8 works fine in most cases (i.e. http://jsbin.com/okahum/50/edit), but if the first paragraph is just "Hi", everything goes haywire? http://jsbin.com/okahum/61/edit
[03:01:27] <Cork> uh... don't tell me...
[03:01:43] <Cork> >_<
[03:01:52] <Cork> mazzachre: found it
[03:01:55] <Cork> and no it's not a bug
[03:02:05] <Cork> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/zYCYs/11/
[03:02:15] <Cork> tiny change and it works fine
[03:02:48] <doug65536> Cork: show doesn't chain?
[03:02:53] <mazzachre> Ah
[03:02:58] <doug65536> I mean offset
[03:02:59] <Cork> doug65536: sure it does
[03:03:08] <Cork> but display: none doesn't have an offset
[03:03:18] <Cork> so current offset is 0
[03:03:19] <doug65536> omg
[03:03:26] <Cork> so you constanty add the offset
[03:05:26] <doug65536> Cork: if css semantics being utterly ridiculous isn't a bug, I could agree with you :)
[03:05:47] <Cork> doug65536: display: none is special; very special
[03:06:01] <Cork> you never want to do calculation of any form on an element with display: none
[03:06:01] <bobdobbs> a little like my first child
[03:06:03] <doug65536> yeah, special, as in the special olympics
[03:06:13] <Cork> doug65536: not really
[03:06:25] <Cork> doug65536: display: none collapses the element, it is like it's not there
[03:06:40] <Cork> doug65536: and if it's not there it can't affect other elements, or have dimentions
[03:06:45] <Cork> *dimensions
[03:07:00] <Cork> it is actually logical, and simple
[03:07:23] <doug65536> yeah, so logical people have to use hacks to get  the size of something because it isn't visible
[03:07:43] <Cork> doug65536: so use visibility instead then
[03:07:49] <Cork> then you won't have that problem
[03:07:57] <Cork> though the element won't collapse either
[03:08:28] <Cork> (you can't eat the cake and have it at the same time)
[03:09:06] <doug65536> the browser knows the position. it's just following the ridiculous spec written by fools imho
[03:09:23] <doug65536> stage 4
[03:09:28] <Cork> doug65536: no actually the browser doesn't
[03:09:53] <Cork> doug65536: quite few years back display: none didn't do this
[03:10:25] <Cork> doug65536: but they changed it cause it meant the browser had to keep track of the display: none elements and all there specs
[03:10:42] <Cork> doug65536: and some pages can have quite a few display: none elements
[03:11:08] <Cork> so to not have to take the hit from those elements on each reflow of the page, they optimized away all display: none elements
[03:11:20] <doug65536> Cork: so you are claiming it is a performance optimization to "forget" the position, and if it becomes visible, reflow
[03:11:28] <Cork> so the browser doesn't event caclulate on those elements
[03:11:29] <Quietwalker> At some point they're going to have to bite the bullet and come up with a real replacement for CSS that isn't selector/tag based, but includes computable features and flow control - an actual style language, instead of a style markup.
[03:11:43] <doug65536> Cork: I could agree if it weren't absolute positioned, but I see your point
[03:11:45] <Quietwalker> but that day is not today ^^;
[03:11:47] <Cork> doug65536: the browser has to recalculate it on each reflow
[03:11:56] <Cork> doug65536: it isn't forgeting it just isn't doing it
[03:12:31] <Cork> doug65536: before the reflow starts they strip away all display: none elements
[03:12:48] <Quietwalker> It'll probably happen shortly after all browsers render the exact same view for a given page
[03:12:54] <Quietwalker> anyway, off to do ... things.
[03:13:00] <Quietwalker> like shower, since it's 5 am over here.
[03:13:03] * Quietwalker scrams.
[03:13:24] <Cork> uh
[03:13:47] <Cork> you don't want style language instead of markup
[03:13:55] <Cork> cause that costs much more to run
[03:14:11] <Cork> and that means it would be as fast as doing all styling from js or something
[03:14:24] <Cork> and css can do computations
[03:15:08] <Syrit> is it possible to execute jQuery commands (parsJson for example) in the javascript console in chorme ? i
[03:15:16] <Cork> yes
[03:15:47] <doug65536> Syrit: depends on the page. $ might not always be jquery. jQuery should usually work
[03:16:07] <doug65536> Syrit: when froze in the debugger in a scope that has jquery, yes for sure
[03:16:27] <Syrit> okay, in my page, i can see that window.sales_rep returns lists of objects, those what i want to parse
[03:16:45] <Cork> Syrit: is it a list of objects, or a string?
[03:16:54] <Syrit> objects Cork
[03:17:00] <Cork> then you don't need to parse it
[03:17:16] <Cork> just do window.sales_rep[0]
[03:17:22] <Syrit> hmm..i see
[03:17:26] <Cork> just do window.sales_rep[0].what ever is in the object
[03:17:48] <Syrit> you right, it worked !
[03:18:12] <Cork> Syrit: json is always a string, if it isn't then it's just js
[03:18:24] <Syrit> i see
[03:26:09] <bobdobbs> how do I get '$' back?
[03:26:23] <bobdobbs> like, I'm loading jQuery and other things with an asynchronous loader
[03:27:03] <bobdobbs> After my scripts have loaded, I can only use access jQuery objects and properties using the syntax "jQuery(...)"
[03:27:21] <Cork> bobdobbs: window.$ = window.jQuery;
[03:27:36] <bobdobbs> Cork: ah, of course!
[03:27:37] <bobdobbs> thanks
[03:27:43] <Cork> bobdobbs: though that sounds like you are running noConflict() somewhere
[03:28:14] <xec_> you could wrap your script in (function($){ ... })(jQuery);
[03:28:17] <bobdobbs> I'm not familar with it. I'm reading the api doc page for it now
[03:28:38] <xec_> make sure you're not conflicting with anything else that might be using $
[03:28:43] <xec_> to*
[03:28:50] <bobdobbs> thanks. I'll be concious of that.
[03:30:07] <bobdobbs> I think I should be ok. As far as I can tell, the other scripts I'm running don't need $
[03:30:42] <goop> $(".post:first").append($("#main")); im trying to move first post to last but not working, any ideas?
[03:30:53] <goop> list of posts within main
[03:31:14] <Cork> geop: other way around
[03:31:24] <goop> ah
[03:31:36] <Cork> $("#main")append($(".post").first())
[03:31:41] <Cork> *$("#main").append($(".post").first())
[03:31:41] <xec_> or appendTo()
[03:31:54] <vsgill> anyone know a jquery plugin for slideshow like this http://www.endpoint.co.uk/
[03:32:46] <goop> great, works like charm
[03:33:54] <goop> man im really enjoying jquery
[03:34:06] <goop> after finding out how easy it is to do great stuff, im surprised more sites don't use it
[03:34:30] <Cork> goop: it is a lib that is used a lot
[03:34:49] <goop> well i guess more aesthetic stuff
[03:35:37] <bobdobbs> I feel like it retarded my progress a lot
[03:35:51] <goop> hows that>
[03:35:58] <bobdobbs> It's so easy to do so many things. And there is a plugin for everything.
[03:36:30] <bobdobbs> the pure convenience of it all held me back a lot from deepening my knowledge of javascript
[03:36:52] <bobdobbs> file under "too much awesome"
[03:37:57] <Cork> bobdobbs: well native dom has advanced a lot in resent years
[03:38:02] <bobdobbs> vsgill: that slideshow might be broken
[03:38:18] <Cork> so you can actually code quite similar to jquery with out it
[03:38:22] <bobdobbs> vsgill: under chrome, I'm not getting animations. I am getting error messages
[03:38:30] <bobdobbs> Cork: oh wow
[03:38:47] <bobdobbs> and here I am learning an animation library
[03:39:03] <Cork> bobdobbs: css3 :)
[03:39:16] <bobdobbs> Cork: yeah, that too.
[03:39:28] <bobdobbs> like, animations, transitions and the like
[03:39:45] <Cork> bobdobbs: most of what made me love jquery was that i didn't have to special case every freaking thing for ie6
[03:39:55] <bobdobbs> ah, I see
[03:40:22] <bobdobbs> Cork: for most of what I do, I don't support anything before ie8
[03:40:23] <Cork> that said, jquery has slimmed down for said reason too
[03:40:32] <bobdobbs> and I charge extra for dealing with 8 quirks
[03:40:40] <bobdobbs> yeah?>
[03:40:41] <Cork> bobdobbs: well i do support ie7; it is easy enough
[03:40:54] <Cork> but ya, i don't normally support ie6 anymore
[03:41:00] <Cork> and i cry every time i have to >_>
[03:41:05] <bobdobbs> hahahah
[03:41:13] * bobdobbs hugs Cork
[03:41:26] <bobdobbs> It's ok Cork. We know. We know.
[03:41:29] <Cork> bobdobbs: http://smplstk.ca/_/no.gif
[03:41:46] <Cork> ah... it's down :/

[03:46:42] <Cork> ie6 on the other hand; is a TOTALLY different matter
[03:47:11] <grafi> well isnt ie6 dead with eol for xp?
[03:47:36] <Cork> grafi: you could snug it into vista, but ya it's been eol for a while
[03:47:52] <Cork> but i don't think ie6 will really die before xp does
[03:48:06] <Cork> though luckely that isn't too far off

[03:50:00] <Cork> lol
[03:50:17] <Cork> do you really want to know?
[03:50:36] <doug65536> if you could find out, you wouldn't want to know?
[03:50:42] <Cork> no
[03:50:59] <doug65536> it would be my big chance to see if sci fi is full of it and you can change the future :)
[03:51:13] <grafi> hm
[04:01:01] <goop> hey whats a good way to change the background color of a link's background, if they have visited it
[04:01:15] <goop> like the box its in
[04:01:26] <goop> so if they click on a box with preview text
[04:01:29] <goop> i can change background
[04:01:37] <Cork> goop: :visited { background-color: something }
[04:01:58] <Cork> uh
[04:02:09] <Cork> or do you mean if they have shown a section in the page or not?
[04:02:29] <goop> its ok i found answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1210871/use-jquery-to-select-visited-links
[04:02:30] <Cork> goop: add a class when they expand it
[04:03:08] <goop> so when i add small things like $("a:visited").parent(".question-summary").addClass("is_visited");
[04:03:14] <goop> should i consolidate all these or what
[04:03:30] <goop> like if i have a bunch of little design things like that
[04:03:38] <Cork> goop: the class names doesn't matter
[04:03:44] <Cork> you can name them how you like
[04:03:57] <goop> i mean when i put it into my website
[04:04:03] <goop> should i give each its own script section
[04:14:02] <frosch> Hi!  Is there any more elegant / efficient way to select several sub elements of some dom element than this way:    var elements = $('#' + elemId + ' :input, #' + elemId + ' span, #' + elemId + ' label'); ? Is there a way to reduce the amount of string concatentations?
[04:14:51] <Cork> frosch: $('#' + elemtId + ' label)
[04:15:01] <Cork> oh wait
[04:15:06] <Cork> sorry i missed the comma
[04:15:40] <Cork> frosch: $('#' + elemId).find(':input, span, label')
[04:16:12] <frosch> Cork: Ah, great! That looks nicer to me :)  What would you prefer?
[04:16:12] <Cork> (and yes that is more efficient too)
[04:16:25] <frosch> Cork: alright! thank you!
[04:16:25] <Cork> frosch: i would go with the find() one
[04:28:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork: to yesterday's problem I faced, i did something like 2nd file here https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6293292 so checkAjaxCallCompletion is triggered within each ajax call and when all calls are completed ie count is 7, I call showTab(1)
[04:34:01] <chriisi>  anyone knows how i can check if images loaded through an $.ajax() requeset are fully loaded yet?
[04:35:21] <Syrit> Cork, to have a select tag populated , should i have Json , or JS objects ?
[04:35:42] <Changa> does anyone know a better way to do this? -> http://jsfiddle.net/vVXgu/ (Categories - subcategories dropdown lists)
[04:36:14] <Cork> Syrit: if you plan to generate the html in js, you need js objects
[04:36:33] <Cork> Syrit: if you just want to populate it you are prob better of just sending html from the server
[04:37:17] <lemonsparrow> Cork: u had a look at it ?
[04:37:23] <lemonsparrow> Cork: to yesterday's problem I faced, i did something like 2nd file here https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6293292 so checkAjaxCallCompletion is triggered within each ajax call and when all calls are completed ie count is 7, I call showTab(1)
[04:37:50] <Cork> Changa: you know you can have sub sections in a dropdown right?
[04:38:04] <Syrit> say, that i want to populate it dynamically in the future, using ember, with databinding, but as experiment now, i want to have json available to the page, and then, populate the select tag using jQuery
[04:38:39] <Changa> Cork: yes, but lists are dynamically loaded with php.
[04:38:44] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i don't see a question
[04:39:03] <Cork> Changa: ah
[04:40:55] <Syrit> where would one define jQuery methods ? i mean , in my rails application, should i write the methods inside the html page? or is there some different way to go ?
[04:41:10] <Jeena> Hi, I have a odd situation here. I use jQuery Mobile and when I do $.mobile.changePage($("#full")) when I am online in firefox OS then everything works just fine, I get the transition etc. But when I turn off WLAN and call that method nothing happens
[04:41:15] <Jeena> any idea why?
[04:41:26] <Changa> any sort of ideas Cork?
[04:41:36] <Cork> Syrit: $('#select').append($.map(list, function(option) { return $('<option>').text(option.text).attr('value', option.value)[0]; }));
[04:41:37] <Jeena> #full is a div page-thingy
[04:41:47] <Cork> Changa: seams good if that is the case
[04:41:59] <Changa> I'm getting a weird problem
[04:42:01] <Changa> in chrome
[04:42:03] <Changa> with this code
[04:42:13] <Syrit> thank you so much Cork
[04:42:18] <Cork> Changa: and that is?
[04:42:43] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I want showTab(1) to be called after all the ajax calls are completed.. so I call a method inside each ajax call which increments a counter and when counter == 7 ie total number of ajax calls... I call showTab(1);
[04:43:05] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ok... and?
[04:43:06] <Changa> altho it all works on FF, on Chrome, for Power and Network - it doesnt work. I don't know how to demonstrate it as the admin panel is protected. and I can't actually get the code working on fiddle. (its the same code)
[04:43:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: showTab() definition involves hiding and showing certain tables which are themselves created using js
[04:43:14] <Changa> Cork^
[04:43:55] <Cork> Changa: what's "Power and Network"?
[04:44:05] <Changa> Main categories
[04:44:09] <Changa> last 2 of main cats
[04:44:32] <Changa> <option value="5">Power</option><option value="6">Network</option> </select>
[04:45:09] <Changa> Everything looks exactly the same, in FF it works as it should but chrome - these last 2 options don't show any subcategories
[04:45:10] <Cork> Changa: btw side note #id>option is slower then #id option
[04:45:23] <Cork> Changa: and as you can't have sub children the > isn't needed
[04:45:38] <Cork> s/can't/don't/
[04:46:10] <Cork> Changa: well to start with, don't use attr selected
[04:49:38] <Changa> Cork: ok I removed >
[04:50:06] <Changa> Cork: I will replace selected with something else, any suggestions?
[04:50:33] <Cork> Changa: would prob go with something like http://jsfiddle.net/vVXgu/1/
[04:50:36] <Cork> it's a bit cleaner
[04:51:04] <Cork> hoping i interpret what you want to do correctly that is
[04:51:31] <Changa> Why doesnt it work in fiddle?
[04:51:55] <Cork> cause showSub is defined in a callback
[04:52:05] <Cork> (btw don't use event attributes)
[04:52:54] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/vVXgu/2/
[04:54:49] <Changa> Cork: this code is much better, unfortunately I am still getting the chrome bug. I don't know what it is but with Power and Network - when they are selected the dropdown doesnt work.
[04:55:32] <Cork> Changa: the fiddle works fine here
[04:55:47] <mike2135> anyone know of a mobile-compatible plugin that'll let you do 1-dimensional dragging with a click-drag, desktop and mobile?
[04:56:41] <Changa> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/vVXgu/3/ -> try this in chrome
[04:57:02] <Cork> works fine here
[04:57:33] <Cork> oh wait hmm
[04:57:37] <Cork> it did work but...
[04:58:01] <Changa> Power and Network?
[04:58:58] <Cork> Changa: what did you change between 2 and 3?
[04:59:01] <Cork> 2 works fine
[04:59:05] <Cork> 3 doesn't
[04:59:07] <Changa> CSS
[04:59:25] <Cork> aha
[04:59:26] <webchao> good day, i have a few understanding problems concerning deferred/promises. I have an array of models, and each model has a .save() callback returning a promise. I have yet to find a way to execute a callback when _all_ save requests have finished, and then reading out if it was successful or not. Here is my current attempt http://jsfiddle.net/B5yUV/
[04:59:59] <Changa> Cork: but this now works on FF.
[05:00:05] <mike2135> sounds like a job for angular webchao  ;)
[05:00:10] <Cork> Changa: ya, chrome doens't like it when you fiddle with the css on the option elements
[05:00:18] <Cork> Changa: same as ie is a bit picky about that
[05:00:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: and things are working fine.. but there is a scenario when only 6 ajax calls are made so in that case I added an extra condition to increment the value myself
[05:00:24] <mike2135> $http(...).success(...).error(...)
[05:00:28] <Changa> Cork: oh deary.
[05:00:43] <Changa> Cork: what can be done?
[05:00:43] <Cork> Changa: this makes things a bit more messy, but you will have to move the options you want to hide out of the select element
[05:00:43] <mike2135> anyone?  1d click/drag library?
[05:01:00] <Cork> Changa: i would have the option elements as an array
[05:01:01] <webchao> mike2135: assuming i cannot use angular.js, what would be the approach with jquery / deferreds?
[05:01:13] <Cork> and then build a new html blob and just inject that in the select tag
[05:01:21] <Cork> Changa: and set val(0)
[05:01:26] <Cork> Changa: should work cross browser
[05:01:33] <webchao> (that is why i am actually in this channel, because $.deferred is jquery)
[05:01:48] <mike2135> isn't it .done()?
[05:01:56] <webchao> i use done
[05:02:07] <webchao> please read the jsfiddle i provide
[05:02:10] <webchao> d
[05:02:18] <Changa> Cork can I pm you?
[05:02:22] <mike2135> my mistake
[05:02:31] <Cork> Changa: preferably not
[05:02:52] <Changa> I'm a bit confused you see. what do you mean move out of the select?
[05:03:30] <webchao> might aswell be a simple scoping problem...
[05:04:03] <Cork> Changa: var options = ['<option></option>', '<option></option>', '<option></option>', '<option></option>'], categories = { cat1: [0,1,2,5,7] };
[05:04:15] <mike2135> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8840257/jquery-ajax-handling-continue-responses-success-vs-done webchao i guess read that
[05:04:21] <mike2135> sry i cant be of more help
[05:04:33] <Cork> Changa: then just build a list of html tags from the categories and options and replace everything in subcat
[05:04:44] <webchao> mike2135: thank you, will give it a try
[05:04:51] <mike2135> are you trying to have 'arguments' be an argument to the done function?
[05:05:08] <Changa> thank you Cork
[05:06:10] <webchao> mike2135: i just want access to the xhr objects, to check which of the requests were successful
[05:06:33] <webchao> i thought those were passed to done, but it doesn't seem like it
[05:06:46] <mike2135> uhh
[05:07:03] <mike2135> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[05:07:15] <mike2135> there are different methods to be called when it succeeds (done), errors (fail ?)
[05:07:27] <mike2135> .always (both)
[05:07:36] <webchao> but how does that work if i return multiple promises
[05:08:00] <webchao> so i would bind success and error to the .save() call directly
[05:08:20] <mike2135> http://api.jquery.com/promise/ <-- i think that's what that page describes in the first example?
[05:09:19] * Successful is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[05:09:34] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but still showTab() isnt getting called on those occasions :(
[05:09:53] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so check what the value is in the function
[05:09:57] <webchao> mike2135: no no
[05:10:12] <webchao> where is that stupid example
[05:10:55] <webchao> mike2135: see here, the example http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[05:11:28] <webchao> mike2135: i hoped i could use the arguments in the done callback, but i can't
[05:12:24] <webchao> maybe the .map to view.model.save() is wrong
[05:12:32] <webchao> maybe i can't do it like that
[05:12:38] <webchao> but then i have a problem
[05:13:23] <webchao> actually that was my question frorm the beginning :) if i have an array of objects which have methods that return promises, how can i use when/then
[05:13:36] <webchao> or when/done or whatever
[05:13:44] <webchao> i seem to do it wrong
[05:14:25] <webchao> right now i am mapping the array to the .save() methods of its object, then call $.when.apply
[05:15:57] <webchao> here is an updated fiddle of what i am doing right now http://jsfiddle.net/B5yUV/1/
[05:16:48] <webchao> does that mapping even make sense? (comes from underscore)
[05:17:16] <webchao> any help or comment would be apprechiated
[05:26:39] <sammich> is the big arschmitz here?
[05:28:46] <seutje> $(SVGElement).find('.someClass') no workie in IE9? :(
[05:29:06] <seutje> bastards didn't implement getElementByClassName on SVGElements, it seems q.q
[05:29:40] <mike2135> i think its time for ms to exit the browser market haha
[05:29:56] <mike2135> it's like a kid who eats worms and all the other kids make fun of him for eating worms...so he doubles down on eating worms
[05:30:04] <mike2135>  :(
[05:32:13] <sammich> triple down
[05:33:07] <mike2135> the court back in 2000 should have made them add firefox (or netscape was it then?) by default
[05:33:14] <mike2135>  to windows
[05:33:27] <mike2135> this would all be over already
[05:35:48] <ericbgsu> MS likes to create confusion...here's a window that connects you to the world...but we are going to make it look like every other window on your OS
[05:35:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: checked in firebug its 7 only
[05:36:06] <mike2135> that was the whole premise behind 'explorer'  :(
[05:36:18] <ericbgsu> yep...beginning of the awfulness
[05:36:21] <webchao> mike2135: the problem seems to be on how i map the array of objects to their .save methods
[05:36:31] <mike2135> type a URL into your location bar?  here let us open IE for you...(6 new viruses were detected)
[05:36:51] <mike2135> webchao: jquery .map perhaps ?
[05:36:51] <ericbgsu> here's a search...might search your machine, might search the web...you'll like the results
[05:36:55] <webchao> is there not a way to say: splat the array which has objects with methods in it, then call methos
[05:37:03] <webchao> mike2135: yeah, this is underscores map
[05:37:07] <mike2135> search MS's database of your hard drive...haha
[05:37:14] <webchao> mike2135: i will try jquerys map, maybe its difference
[05:37:25] <mike2135> nah, underscore's is better
[05:37:28] <mike2135> imho
[05:37:33] <ericbgsu> the database will be faster once we're done indexing everything...
[05:37:35] <ericbgsu> I"m done
[05:37:38] <webchao> mike2135: well then its not working heh
[05:38:13] <mike2135> .map(promiseArray, function(prom){prom.done(...)})
[05:38:45] <webchao> wwell i guess that proves that i cannot map array entities to methods returning promises, then call promises on it
[05:38:59] <webchao> er
[05:39:06] <webchao> then call $.when on them
[05:39:09] <webchao> ah well
[05:39:15] <webchao> i have to think of something now
[05:39:19] <mike2135> id have to see your code
[05:39:21] <webchao> sadness, i hoped it would work
[05:39:32] <mike2135> sounds a little crooked from here
[05:40:10] <webchao> mike2135: http://jsfiddle.net/rYqDK/
[05:41:06] <mike2135> you're sure those are valid promises?
[05:41:21] <webchao> yes, its Backbones .save method, it returns promises
[05:41:27] <mike2135> k
[05:41:32] <webchao> jquery xhr to be exact
[05:41:44] <mike2135> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4878887/how-do-you-work-with-an-array-of-jquery-deferreds
[05:41:47] <mike2135> answer #1 here perhaps?
[05:42:19] <seutje> shouldn't u be using $.map(changedModels, fn) instead of $(changedModels).map()?
[05:42:22] <mike2135> im about as familiar with this as you, sry
[05:42:39] <seutje> assuming it isn't a jQuery object
[05:42:44] <seutje> and if it is, u can just changedModels.map()
[05:43:07] <webchao> seutje: this is underscore
[05:44:44] <seutje> underscore docs suggest the same
[05:45:31] <webchao> seutje: underscore provides two different ways.
[05:45:42] <webchao> one is _,map(collection, fn)
[05:45:51] <webchao> the other _(collection).map(fn)
[05:46:00] <seutje> they only bothered to document one though
[05:46:02] <webchao> but let me try the other notation just for control
[05:46:54] <seutje> yeah, the map seems to work fine
[05:46:58] <xec_> what about collection.map(fn) - assuming the collection is an array
[05:47:23] <webchao> xec_: that doesn't work as underscore doesn't actually extend the Array prototype there
[05:47:40] <webchao> or is it some ecmascript wizardry i don't know of yet?
[05:47:41] <xec_> webchao: it doesn't need to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[05:47:51] <webchao> apparently yes
[05:48:06] <xec_> of course, IE8 won't like it
[05:48:24] <webchao> who gives a shit about IE :)
[05:48:27] <xec_> there's a nice shim, but honestly, i stopped caring about ie8
[05:48:28] <xec_> yeah
[05:49:10] <seutje> yeah well, the map isn't the issue, and since ur already using underscore and jQuery, might as well use their safer function
[05:49:14] <lemonsparrow> is there a shorthand to this code snippet ? https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6293292
[05:49:21] <lemonsparrow> boolean comparison
[05:49:37] <webchao> as mike2135 already implied it might be that backbone actually screws the promises up
[05:49:49] <mike2135> do a console.log to be sure
[05:49:59] <webchao> yes yes
[05:50:06] <mike2135> lemonsparrow: ..ternary?
[05:50:06] <seutje> the problem is most likely in what save() is returning exactly
[05:50:06] <webchao> it fucking works now
[05:50:32] <seutje> lemonsparrow: don't think u can change it much without making it impossible to read
[05:50:38] <webchao> it was indeed a problem with the .map, it seems
[05:50:40] <lemonsparrow> mike2135: yeah something like that
[05:50:43] <webchao> let me provide the code that works
[05:50:44] <lemonsparrow> seutje: try
[05:50:50] <seutje> webchao: u kidding? o.O
[05:51:17] <webchao> seutje: i am not :(
[05:51:38] <seutje> no :(
[05:51:40] <seutje> it works now
[05:51:42] <seutje> be happy :P
[05:52:00] <webchao> http://jsfiddle.net/rYqDK/1/
[05:52:07] <webchao> thank you very much all of you
[05:52:22] <seutje> this is why I'm not too keen about working with backbone, too many black magic behind the scenes that becomes hard to manipulate or even find
[05:52:41] <mike2135> thats why i love angular seutje
[05:53:00] <seutje> so doing _(collection) actually manipulates it
[05:53:00] <Syrit> can any one please tell me, what's wrong in this ? and why the value is not appended?  http://jsbin.com/okIS/2/edit
[05:53:14] <seutje> well, returns a manipulated copy of it, I guess
[05:53:15] <webchao> seutje: some strange thing is going on there, yes
[05:53:40] <seutje> which is prolly where the issue lies: making a copy and working with that
[05:53:59] <webchao> seutje: note that _(backboneCollection).foo doesn't actually return a backbone collection but rather a 'normal' Array. which is not documentedd
[05:54:23] <webchao> however in this case it was an array to begin with, so not relvant
[05:54:34] <mike2135> seutje: gives you an array of the return values of f(n) applied to the elements
[05:54:39] <webchao> anyway, thanks again seutje mike2135 xec_
[05:54:43] <xec_> Syrit: jquery is not included? there is no element with id #select ?
[05:54:45] <webchao> i am stupid
[05:54:47] <mike2135> gl webchao
[05:54:50] <webchao> :)
[05:54:53] <tuxskar> Hello I would like to sort and search on 4 rows of collapsed lists, Does anyone know what plugin would help me?
[05:55:11] <Syrit> xec_, the select is considered a class then ?
[05:55:19] <seutje> mike2135: I meant just passing it to the underscore function, without applying any methods on it yet
[05:55:38] <xec_> Syrit: no, <select> is an element. <select class="thisIsAClassName">
[05:55:49] <Syrit> oh, i see
[05:56:01] <xec_> Syrit: to select all select elements, do $("select")
[05:56:06] <tuxskar> the idea is I just want to have a input text box and while I'm typing I'd like to filter the collapse items match with what I typed
[05:56:07] <xec_> no pun intended
[05:56:09] <Syrit> so to add an id, i would do <select id="someID"> ?
[05:56:13] <xec_> yeah
[05:56:18] <Syrit> oh, i see
[05:57:03] <xec_> Syrit: in that demo, i assume it's lacking context, the variables "mercedes" and "Mersedes" are not defined...
[05:57:29] <xec_> there's also a missing plus sign in the concatenation
[05:57:58] <tuxskar> I have seen pluggins as list.js, mixitUp or shuffle.js but I don'e know what would be better, has someone experience with any of them?
[05:58:01] <xec_> and the wrapping $(...) in the append is redundant
[05:58:06] <Syrit> so, if i wanted them to be statically added, will converting them to strings will do the trick ?
[05:59:29] <Syrit> i did this mods but still not working xec_
[05:59:30] <Syrit> http://jsbin.com/okIS/5/edit
[06:01:03] <xec_> don't put html in the script field
[06:01:05] <xec_> Syrit: http://jsbin.com/okIS/3/edit
[06:02:27] <Syrit> thanks xec_  !
[06:10:01] <seutje> oh IE...
[06:10:16] <seutje> grab innerHTML and it somehow put an attribute twice on the same element
[06:10:29] <seutje> then when u try to parse the HTML it just gave you, it flips out
[06:11:09] <Parsi1> I'm using two jquery plugins, vticker and raccordion. when i use them separately they are fine, but when i use them together i face this error: TypeError: x.easing[this.easing] is not a function. http://jsfiddle.net/xNSQg/
[06:11:15] <seutje> "an attribute with the same name already exists on the element" - well I wasn't the one who copied it over again...
[06:12:11] <pedda> hi there
[06:13:09] <pedda> can someone help me with a google map being rendered within twitter bootstrap carousel, where only a part of it is visible, while the rest of the div remains gray ?
[06:15:16] <seutje> any ideas how to remove duplicate attributes from markup in a huge string? :D
[06:15:59] <xec_> lol seutje
[06:16:19] <seutje> sure, make fun
[06:16:20] <mazzachre> omg... Is there a way to make jquery set opcaity css correct for IE8?
[06:16:23] <xec_> yet another reason to hate on ie
[06:16:32] <mazzachre> Or do I have to invoke the filter thingie?
[06:16:38] <seutje> yet another reason to hate on XML*
[06:17:12] <mazzachre> Yes, add to end of list on why to hate ie... and add to end of list of why I am going to die an early death...
[06:17:49] <xec_> not early enough...
[06:17:56] <xec_> lol sorry that came out horribly wrong
[06:18:16] <xec_> i meant IE makes me want to die some times, not that i want *you* to die :P
[06:18:17] <seutje> wow :x
[06:18:39] <seutje> nope, u still told him to get on with dying quicker in my mind
[06:19:01] <seutje> mazzachre: just animating opacity usually works for me
[06:19:05] <xec_> yeah, it sounded better in my head before i typed it out for some reason
[06:19:05] <Aquaword> anyone had problem using bootstrap datepicker in a bootstrap modal?
[06:19:14] <seutje> when it doesn't it's usually because other shit is conflicting with it
[06:19:39] <seutje> like position: relative on a container or display: inline on the opacitized element
[06:20:10] <seutje> no regex gurus who feel like helping me fix the HTML IE gives me but can't parse itself
[06:20:13] <xec_> ie8 doesn't support opacity, does it?
[06:20:22] <seutje> it's afilter
[06:20:36] <seutje> mazzachre: wait, ur not using 2.x are u?
[06:20:44] <seutje> cause that won't do anything to massage shit for IE
[06:30:14] <mazzachre> I am not... currently stuck with 1.7 due to corporate shi... decicions..
[06:32:06] <airdem> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/412469b8ad1f29a55cc2 creates progressbar but with no progress. (value = 0) i have checked "usage" and it definetly contains a number > 0 and < max
[06:32:42] <airdem> running $('.ui-progressbar').progressbar('option', 'value', 32); from console changes the state correctly
[06:33:36] <Cork> airdem: is usage a string or a number?
[06:33:38] <dkphenom> is it possible to post .ajax request to the same page orr does it have to be to a different file?
[06:33:45] <Cork> try parseInt(usage, 10)
[06:34:06] <airdem> parse int did it
[06:34:07] <Cork> dkphenom: js doesn't care, it depend on server side
[06:34:26] <airdem> strange that "value" needs parseInt and max not
[06:34:29] <airdem> thanks guys
[06:37:06] <Cork> airdem: usage / 100 == NaN
[06:37:12] <Cork> airdem: or something like that i guess
[06:37:27] <airdem> makes sense
[06:43:29] <ryannielson> Made a jQuery plugin called progress to show scrolling progress through articles, based on this discussion on Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6239285. The plugin is located at https://github.com/RyanNielson/jquery-progress. I figured it might be of use to some people. If you have and enhancement ideas or issues feel free to post them on the Github issue tracker.
[06:59:10] <Syrit> is this considered a json array ? "[{"id":"51fe2319d7037eb207000002","first_name":"NewSalesRe","last_name":"last"},{"id":"51f2402bd7037e8daa000005","first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Jobs"},{"id":"51f24009d7037e57e5000004","first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Hartel"}]"
[07:00:09] <lemonsparrow> how to remove all <tr> from a table given it's id using jquery ?
[07:00:11] <ryannielson> Syrit: Without the " on the start and end, yes
[07:00:44] <ryannielson> $('table').find('tr').remove() should probably work
[07:00:58] <Syrit> in the chrome javascript console, when i print the name of the window.sales_reps, it shows me this array !
[07:01:07] <burzum> hi
[07:02:03] <burzum>  is there a way to do "select all tr where group < 4" using jquery selectors? I have something like <tr group="3"> and want to select all smaller than 3
[07:02:05] <lemonsparrow> ryannielson: no it clears all data including head, body and foot I only want to remove all tr inside body
[07:02:11] <ph88> when passing some data with an event will it keep a reference to the original data? (when the handler change the data, the original gets changed?)
[07:02:32] <ryannielson> Syrit: If it comes out with the quotes on the beginning and end, then it may be stored as a string. As the chrome console should format json properly.
[07:02:40] <Cork> burzum: no but you can use filter()
[07:02:59] <ryannielson> lemonsparrow: Inside the page body, or inside the table body?
[07:03:00] <Syrit> ryannielson, how can i make sure of that ? is there some method like class name ?
[07:03:20] <lemonsparrow> ryannielson: table body
[07:03:27] <Cork> burzum: also don't add arbitrary attributes to your dom without prefixing them with data-
[07:03:39] <ryannielson> Syrit: try typeof window.sales_reps
[07:03:53] <Cork> burzum: there is no garantee browsers won't implement a group attribute in the future, and then your page will break
[07:04:13] <Syrit> actually ryannielson , when i use console.log(sales_reps) it comes to the console wihtout qutes !
[07:04:40] <ryannielson> lemosonsparrow $("table > tbody").find("tr").remove() or $("table > tbody").children("tr").remove() if you only want to remove direct trs
[07:04:41] <Cork> burzum: burzum: $('tr[data-group]').filter(function(elm) { return elm.dataGroup < 4; })
[07:04:45] <Syrit> but when i use typof it says string :(
[07:05:03] <nooneelse> Someone have any problem using the MaskMoney plugin while applying the bonus method element.maskMoney('mask') that apply the current mask ?
[07:05:10] <Cork> ryanneufeld: why not just $('table tbody').empty() ?
[07:05:59] <Cork> ryanneufeld: or even $('tbody').empty() ?
[07:06:39] <ryannielson> Syrit: JSON.parse(window.sales_reps) will convert it to a json object.
[07:06:47] <Aquaword> hey
[07:06:57] <Cork> ryannielson: uh no it will parse json
[07:06:58] <Aquaword> why I get undefined result here: http://pastie.org/8256695
[07:07:11] <Cork> ryannielson: json is a string, objects is javascript
[07:07:27] <burzum> Cork I agree, that html was delivered by the designer ^_^
[07:07:37] <ryannielson> Cork: That'll turn a string from a string to a json object that you can work with will it not?
[07:07:48] <Cork> burzum: then tell them to fix it, the code is actually invalid html
[07:08:01] <ryannielson> Cork: If the string is basically a json object that was converted to a string.
[07:08:02] <Cork> burzum: the html spec has a prefix for your own attributes data-
[07:08:03] <burzum> im doing that now
[07:08:20] <Syrit> JSON.parse gives me back an array of objects ryannielson
[07:08:29] <Cork> ryannielson: like i said, there is no such thing as a json object
[07:08:58] <ryannielson> Syrit: Which is what you want is it not? That's what that string represents.
[07:09:04] <Cork> ryannielson: '{"a":1}' <-- json ; {"a":1} <-- javascript
[07:09:24] <Cork> ryannielson: you can parse json, but not an object
[07:09:26] <ryannielson> Cork: Ya, you're right. Terminology mixup.
[07:09:53] <Cork> ryannielson: and window.sales_reps should be an js array
[07:10:02] <Cork> it was it when i helped him a few h ago
[07:10:09] <Syrit> so, Cork , if i used typeOf, and it gives me "string" it means that it's in json format right !?
[07:10:23] <ryannielson> Syrit: So yes, technically that's a json array. and You can use JSON.parse if you want a javascript array of objects to work with.
[07:10:25] <Cork> Syrit: well it might be json
[07:10:31] <Cork> Syrit: it might also just be a string :)
[07:10:36] <Aquaword> anyone?
[07:10:53] <jla> I've inherited an older site written using jquery and jquery-ui. I'm looking into switching to ajax.googleapis.com, but I don't know what the 'custom' in jquery-ui-1.8.6.custom.min.js means. What is that about?
[07:11:31] <Cork> jla: if you build jquery ui on jqueryui.com it will have that
[07:11:32] <Syrit> :) thanks Cork, when i used $.each(sales_reps,function(index, value) {
[07:11:32] <Syrit>        alert(this);});
[07:11:32] <Syrit> TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '231' i
[07:11:37] <Cork> jla: cause it migth not be everything
[07:12:21] <Cork> Syrit: then you should fix the original problem we talked about
[07:12:22] <ryannielson> Syrit: It's a string so it's going to try to loop through each letter in the string I believe. Do the JSON.parse thing I mentioned and that'll work
[07:12:37] <Cork> Syrit: your dubble encoding the json when you putput it in rails
[07:12:42] <jla> Cork: so it may be a 'stripped' version? Should it be safe to point to a full version, like http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.6/jquery-ui.min.js?
[07:12:51] <Cork> Syrit: you should not js escape the json output
[07:13:04] <Cork> Syrit: that would give you a javascript array and no need to parse it
[07:13:23] <Cork> jla: yes, it is
[07:13:34] <jla> Cork: tyvm
[07:13:37] <Cork> np
[07:16:34] <Kingsy> I am trying to undetstand some js from the outside in, what does this do --> this.messages = this.window.select('.messages')[0]; ? I am getting an error from it I THINK..
[07:16:58] <Kingsy> yeha the error is Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'select' of null
[07:17:51] <Cork> Kingsy: kinda impossible question to answer
[07:18:07] <Cork> Kingsy: but the error means that window isn't defined on this
[07:18:10] <Kingsy> hmm I am sorry, I am being very vague, but its because I am trying to understand the error.
[07:18:12] <Cork> so select can't be called on it
[07:18:33] <Kingsy> ohhhhh I SEE
[07:18:39] <Cork> this.window.select('.messages')[0]; means that from this the browser tries to access window, and from there select
[07:18:44] <Kingsy> window is defined earlier in the function.
[07:18:45] <Cork> then it tries to run select with the string
[07:18:49] <Kingsy> boom
[07:18:50] <Cork> it expects an array back
[07:18:50] <rved> hi all
[07:18:54] <Kingsy> ok
[07:18:56] <Cork> and grab the first element in that array
[07:19:12] <BillCriswell> I think someone was just trying to use alias jQuery as select.
[07:19:14] <Kingsy> let me see then
[07:19:38] <rved> I'm searching for a good jquery templating plug-in to render JSON into a template, i've searched a lot but don't know which one is best. Any recommendations?
[07:20:06] <Cork> rved: jqote2
[07:20:11] <Cork> ?g jquery.jqote2
[07:20:12] <b-ot> Cork: jQote2 – Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code → http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[07:20:34] <rved> is 'jquery tempting' still the way to go in 2013?
[07:20:57] <Cork> depends if you need to generate complext html in js
[07:21:07] <Cork> else prob not
[07:21:11] <BillCriswell> rved: If you'll be doing it a lot mustache is pretty sweet. If you need it for a few things I usually have underscore available to use _.template
[07:21:53] <rved> well, I'm using it a lot. Building a dashboard and each widget has a JSON returned
[07:22:00] <Cork> rved: often it is more efficient to just send html from server side
[07:22:11] <rved> but i do wonder if jquery templating is still 'the way to go' in 2013?
[07:22:28] <Cork> rved: best option if you need to generate the html yes
[07:22:41] <rved> i usually just output a html on a unique url, using my CMS (silverstripe) RenderWith->(template)
[07:23:02] <rved> but the developers say: EpiServer can't do that, cause its now MVC?
[07:23:15] <Cork> :)
[07:23:45] <Cork> rved: you can still send html in responses to an ajax call
[07:23:52] <Cork> even in mvc structures
[07:24:07] <Cork> you normally have a formating view that generates the html though
[07:24:34] <BillCriswell> Cork: jqote2 seems nice. The name is pretty terrible, though.
[07:24:50] <Cork> BillCriswell: ya, it is really clean in it's syntax too
[07:24:58] <Cork> and fast
[07:25:00] <Cork> really fast
[07:25:35] <Cork> though i've found my self questioning doing html rendering in js
[07:25:52] <Cork> its often overcompensating things for no reason
[07:26:03] <BillCriswell> Cork: I hear that.
[07:26:23] <Cork> where you find your self writing a partial server side
[07:26:33] <Cork> and then writing the same partial as a js template
[07:26:41] <Cork> that's just silly
[07:27:16] <BillCriswell> Indeed.
[07:28:04] <rved> hmm
[07:28:14] <rved> where are the examples of jQote2?
[07:28:22] <rved> i don't see them in github
[07:28:41] <lemonsparrow> I have a table and I have sort options on it which happens on backend using ajax call.. so I reload the tables with sorted data using a method similar to this.. https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6295151 it works fine but  there is a glimpse of both the unsorted and sorted data being displayed together for a fraction of second before the sorted data gets appended properly.. what is going wrong ?
[07:28:58] <Cork> rved: http://aefxx.com/api/jqote2-reference/
[07:30:30] <Cork> lemonsparrow: don't append to the live dom in a loop
[07:30:36] <Cork> that WILL kill your performance
[07:30:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: what to do ?
[07:31:03] <Cork> lemonsparrow: instead create either an empty jquery selector and append to that, or just a simple array
[07:31:14] <lemonsparrow> Cork:could u show it in the code ?
[07:31:15] <Cork> and then append it all together to the tbody after the loop
[07:31:16] <sammich> or just a string you append to
[07:31:20] <BillCriswell> I definitely prefer Handlebars documentation. They did a great job with it.
[07:31:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the same logic works fine for another table.. dont know why it is behaving wierd here
[07:32:27] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/t5mpJ/
[07:32:46] <Cork> lemonsparrow: also btw when i think about it
[07:32:54] <Cork> skip the empty call and use html() instead of append
[07:33:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: if I dont call empty() how will the previous data get deleted?
[07:34:04] <Cork> lemonsparrow: by html()
[07:34:07] <Cork> it replaces the content
[07:34:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could u reedit that fiddle.. i would understand ur idea better http://jsfiddle.net/t5mpJ/
[07:34:53] <Cork> uh
[07:35:11] <Syrit> Cork, i was using .to_json 2 times, You are right :) thanks man
[07:35:11] <Cork> s/\$tbody.append/\$tbody.html/
[07:35:19] <Cork> lemonsparrow: nothing else changed
[07:35:30] <lemonsparrow> Cork: rows.push($tr[0]) should be rows.push($tr[i])    ??
[07:35:35] <Cork> no
[07:35:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: always 0 ?
[07:35:57] <Cork> yes cause you want the dom element out of the jquery object
[07:36:08] <Cork> no need to build an array of jquery objects
[07:36:25] <lemonsparrow> Cork: should I remove the $tbody.empty();
[07:36:38] <Cork> like i said if you use .html you don't need .empty()
[07:36:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: k
[07:37:14] <Cork> the up side to that structure is, the old data will be there until the second it gets replaced
[07:37:17] <Cork> no empty state
[07:37:51] <lemonsparrow> Cork: k
[07:38:23] <Cork> lemonsparrow: though if you trust the data to be xss safe you can build it as a string instead
[07:38:36] <Cork> but then you have to be sure it's free of html tags
[07:39:02] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that would speed it up a bit more, but like i said at the cost of risking xss
[07:43:17] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I modified it as per what u said couldnt replace append with html in all cases.. but still the issue persists.. this is my complete method https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6295151
[07:43:52] <duckgoose> now :|
[07:44:27] <Cork> lemonsparrow: remove line 6 and replace append with html on line 44
[07:45:53] <Cork> lemonsparrow: if you still get the inbetween state after that, it sounds like something else is messing with it
[07:46:14] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok leme check
[07:48:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: well its still there kinda 2/6 times it happens otherwise it woks perfect
[07:49:20] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then add some debug code to make sure the code doesn't run more times then you expect
[07:49:37] <Cork> and nothing else triggers and things like that
[07:50:34] <rved> Cork: thanks for the help so far. I found "view-source:http://futtta.be/jqote2/" as an example
[07:50:41] <gryzor_> Hi. What's wrong with this? str keeps being "null"
[07:50:45] <gryzor_> http://apaste.info/lyHu
[07:51:04] <rved> is it true that you always have to use <script type="text/x-jqote-template"></script> inside my html?
[07:51:31] <Cork> gryzor_: whats $( this ).text() ?
[07:51:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[07:51:55] <rved> Cork: can't i just do all the rendering from one jQUery/
[07:51:59] <gryzor_> Cork: an <option> from a <select>. It contains "foo" or "foo2"
[07:52:03] <Cork> rved: no, only if you want to store the template in a script tag
[07:52:10] <rved> ok ty
[07:52:22] <Cork> gryzor_: is it the test or the value of the option?
[07:53:14] <gryzor_> Cork: it's all stuff like this : <option value="foo">foo</option>
[07:53:43] <Cork> gryzor_: add a console.log in the loop with $(this).text()
[07:53:58] <gryzor_> a console.log ?
[07:54:16] <Cork> console.log($(this).text())
[07:54:23] <gryzor_> ok
[07:54:27] <Cork> and make sure it actually is what you expect
[07:54:36] <Cork> make sure there are no spaces or things like that in there
[07:54:38] <gryzor_> I think it is. I debugged it with alert()
[07:54:57] <Cork> gryzor_: alert won't tell you as well what's in there
[07:55:10] <Cork> gryzor_: also does the select support multi selection?
[07:55:17] <gryzor_> no multi select
[07:55:50] <Cork> gryzor_: then just do $( "#actdesc" ).text($( "#datastruct" ).data($( "#datastruct" ).val()))
[07:56:07] <Cork> no need for all the other string loop stuff
[07:56:35] <Cork> (also you might want to use a variable for your jquery objects)
[07:57:36] <OnkelTem> Hi all
[08:00:52] <gryzor_> Cork : now I have this. Result is same. Displays "null" : http://apaste.info/AH8x
[08:01:34] <Cork> gryzor_: ok and what does console.log($( "#datastruct" ).val()) give you ?
[08:02:14] <clarkk> would someone mind directing me to a specific page that describes when to prefix a variable with the jquery shortcut (ie $categories) and when you can simply use a standard variable (ie categories), please?
[08:02:36] <gryzor_> I don't know what console.log is supposed to do. It seems to display nothing more for me.
[08:02:41] <Cork> clarkk: there is no rule for it
[08:02:55] <arschmitz> clarkk: internally as a project jquery never uses $varname
[08:03:06] <Cork> clarkk: it's just a practice that some use to identify the jquery object that $() generates
[08:03:22] <gryzor_> I have this now : http://apaste.info/2br6
[08:03:27] <Cork> gryzor_: what browser are you running in?
[08:03:38] <gryzor_> this is Firefox 23, on windows vista
[08:03:45] <clarkk> Cork: arschmitz  - thank you for the responses...
[08:03:52] <Cork> gryzor_: ctrl + shift + k
[08:04:22] <clarkk> Cork: if you assign a jquery object to a standard variable, will that variable contain the jquery object?
[08:04:29] <clarkk> Cork: logically, the answer is yes
[08:04:43] <gryzor_> It says the API of the console log has been deactivated by a script on this page...
[08:04:44] <Cork> clarkk: $ is just a variable character, it has NO magic meaning
[08:05:06] <clarkk> Cork: ahh, I get it. So only $() has the magic? :)
[08:05:14] <rved> Cork: how do you use a template that is not stored in a script tag?
[08:05:16] <Cork> gryzor_: f5 and run the code again
[08:05:24] <Cork> clarkk: no no magic
[08:05:39] <Cork> clarkk: window.$ = function() {} <-- this will create a function with the name $
[08:05:55] <Cork> clarkk: nothing special about $ at all
[08:06:14] <gryzor_> Cork: it also says using the "mutation events" is obsolete. Use "MutationObserver" instead - and that's all it says
[08:06:17] <Cork> rved: you would have it in a javascript string
[08:06:23] <Cork> rved: or load it over ajax
[08:06:27] <clarkk> yes, I understand that, but $() in the global context is a the jquery object, isn't it?
[08:06:42] <Cork> gryzor_: after you run the console.log command it should show up in there
[08:06:45] <rved> so, make an html file of the CDATA?
[08:06:53] <rved> and load that into a div
[08:06:54] <rved> using ajax
[08:07:06] <Cork> gryzor_: uncheck everything except loggin in the console if you don't find it
[08:07:29] <Cork> rved: just text, no need for cdata
[08:08:01] <Cork> rved: cdata is only needed if you want to escape it from the html parser
[08:08:09] <gryzor_> Cork: i also have : unknown property "box-sizing". Declaration abandonned"
[08:08:11] <Cork> and that only acts when you parse it
[08:08:19] <Cork> gryzor_: uncheck everything except loggin in the console if you don't find it <--
[08:08:20] <gryzor_> but that's CSS stuff, right
[08:08:22] <Cork> gryzor_: uncheck everything except loggin in the console if you don't find it <--
[08:08:24] <Cork> gryzor_: uncheck everything except loggin in the console if you don't find it <--
[08:08:45] <gryzor_> Cork: There are 4 lines in there, that's all. I think I would find it if anything was in there.
[08:09:00] <Cork> gryzor_: then your code isn't running
[08:09:15] <OnkelTem> Isotope library question (to those who know it): is there a way to scale items after layout to fit isotope's masonry columnWidth?
[08:11:42] <Whirl3d> Just wanted to check in and make sure that no one has come up with a way to effectively build private methods into select jquery objects,
[08:12:23] <Whirl3d> like to create a class of objects that when initialized would have their own methods like $(".class").doMyThing();
[08:12:45] <Cork> Whirl3d: not really possible
[08:13:13] <Whirl3d> That's what I thought. Just wanted to make sure something hadn't changed. Thanks.
[08:13:20] <Cork> you would have a way to know of missing function for that to work
[08:13:49] <Whirl3d> say again?
[08:14:07] <Cork> Whirl3d: though i guess you could do something like .private('doMything')
[08:14:23] <Cork> and have private checking for function private to the dom element
[08:14:59] <Whirl3d> like you could store the method in the data attr of the element and the $.private would look for that named function as a data element and applly the element to it?
[08:15:36] <Cork> sure that would work
[08:15:56] <Whirl3d> Cork, you are brilliant. Lemme see if I can work that out. Thanks for your help.
[08:15:57] <Cork> though nothing would prevent someone from doing .data('var-name')()
[08:16:38] <ernston> hello again
[08:18:59] <Whirl3d> Cork, is there any way to protect the data- attribute on an element?
[08:19:15] <gryzor_> Well I think my code is running, as firefox displays "null".
[08:19:23] <gryzor_> But the console is still as much empty...
[08:19:36] <ernston> Whirl3d nearly done it :0
[08:19:57] <Whirl3d> ernston, great. How has it been going?
[08:20:18] <ernston> nightmare, u?
[08:20:37] <ernston> am a jquery noob
[08:20:45] <ernston> and regarding js, what a mess i make
[08:21:27] <Whirl3d> Cork, what if I created an object that elements could register with and the .private method (extension to jquery) would call the central register objects named method using the elements as the context?
[08:22:24] <Whirl3d> kind  of like a subscriber/listener system but more like an agent/actor thing
[08:22:47] <Whirl3d> ernston where is it at now?
[08:22:56] <ernston> let me check
[08:23:11] <ernston> it has gone under some changes and undoing
[08:23:24] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/120/
[08:23:36] <ernston> someone recommended to me that a new function is made
[08:26:07] <Whirl3d> ernston, it's looking better, but here is my concern..ask people in here, but I think it is a LOT easier to select your elements by rating and service first because you just create a string with "." before it and select it. No need to use the :contains" filter there
[08:26:52] <ernston> i know that i need to adjust the $matches
[08:27:08] <ernston> tried copying the $list
[08:28:44] <ernston> what is concerning me now is that i have 1 function
[08:28:54] <ernston> and will have 3 inside, 1 for each major element type
[08:29:03] <Whirl3d> var classList=get_ratings()+get_services();   then get_ratings would return a string like ".rating3" and get_services would return a string like ".420.bighit" and the combined effect would be $(".rating4.430.bighit") which is an easy selector
[08:29:07] <ernston> what if two are selected but not the other ?
[08:31:06] <ernston> i had not got to the services yet
[08:31:15] <ernston> i was trying to get serach + slider working
[08:31:49] <Roots47> anyone here familiar with jcarousellite?
[08:31:55] <gryzor_> Cork: Now all i have is this  : http://apaste.info/29l5 and it won't display "foo" in the console.log neither...
[08:33:05] <gryzor_> forget it. This browser is bloated.
[08:36:18] <gryzor_> Cork: so according to a browser that works, console.log indicates that $( "#datastruct" ).val() is undefined. For the record the code it runs is :http://apaste.info/xxtP
[08:37:30] <gryzor_> And i just understood why console.log was remaining empty. Looks like firebug running is the cause for it.
[08:38:01] <ernston> i cant get my head around this
[08:38:12] <ernston> there are 3 major conditions right ?
[08:39:15] <Whirl3d> ernston, here is what I suggest doing: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/122/
[08:39:40] <Whirl3d> create the string for the classes you select against first. That's easy and will give you a much smaller list to do your keyword searches on
[08:40:11] <ernston> that part of:     listElements=$(PUT YOUR LI ELEMENTS HERE); ?
[08:40:22] <Whirl3d> I have to run, be back in an hour---I just included the logic there between the comments.
[08:40:41] <ernston> thanx
[08:40:44] <Whirl3d> I forget how you listed them, I'll be back in an hour to check with you. Sorry to run
[08:40:46] <ernston> ill still be here :P
[08:40:51] <ernston> p
[08:40:52] <ernston> np
[08:40:55] <ernston> i got all day :p
[08:43:42] <Cork> gryzor_: uh, wait a min what was the original code again?
[08:44:30] <Cork> gryzor_: i think the selector might be wrong for the val call
[08:44:42] <Cork> you might want $(this).val() there instead
[08:46:07] <clarkk> what is the difference between var self = this; and var self = $(this) ?
[08:47:16] <Cork> clarkk: the second one will generate a jquery wrapped dom element
[08:47:24] <Swayz> this would be the object it's currently working with and $(this) would be jquery's selected element (could be anything)
[08:47:25] <Cork> clarkk: taken that this is a dom element that is
[08:48:12] <clarkk> ok thank you Cork
[08:48:27] <gryzor_> Cork: Yeah, i've just taken that path... hacking around and will be asking again as I will be keeping failing :)
[08:49:21] <Cork> gryzor_: .val() is meant to run on the select element that is changed
[08:49:34] <Cork> gryzor_: it would return the currently selected value
[08:49:51] <gryzor_> Cork: Yes, that part works, and I can console.log(à it fine.
[08:50:28] <gryzor_> Cork: but $( "#datastruct" ).data($( this ).val()) always return "null" it seems
[08:50:51] <gryzor_> *returns*
[08:51:14] <killer`toaster> I'm using a JS setInterval() for a stopwatch and jQuery to edit some fields. When I switch tabs, the stopwatch stops running, until I switch back to the tab it's on. Any idea how to keep it running even if I switch tabs? Using Chrome btw
[08:52:11] <gryzor_> Cork: is there a method to dump the content of a "complex" object, such as the full #datastruct here ?
[08:54:17] <Cork> gryzor_: uh datastruct is a dom element
[08:54:25] <Cork> gryzor_: you mean you want to dump the html?
[08:54:52] <Cork> killer`toaster: user requestAnimationFrame and Date
[08:54:58] <gryzor_> I only defined that element to store data in it and request data from it. according to http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/data-methods/
[08:55:23] <Cork> killer`toaster: setInterval will skew so you can't depend on it for counting correctly
[08:55:44] <Cork> gryzor_: uh... why?
[08:55:49] <clarkk> Cork: how do you know when something returned by jquery will be jquery-wrapped? For example, does a selection like var stuff = $('.myclass') return a standard dom element, or a jquery wrapped dom element?
[08:56:05] <gryzor_> Cork: I'm a js+jquery noob.
[08:56:16] <gryzor_> that's probably why
[08:56:23] <clarkk> Cork: I mean, collection of dom elements vs jquery wrapped collection
[08:56:31] <Cork> clarkk: everything except functions that state they return a bool or string will return a jquery object
[08:56:48] <gryzor_> that "Data Methods" page describes something it seemed i could use. So i did.
[08:56:56] <idbentley> clarkk, return types are  documented on api.jquery.com
[08:56:59] <clarkk> ah right, Cork - ok let me dwell on that. Thanks for your help! :)
[08:57:03] <Cork> gryzor_: first you could just bind it on the select element instead, or use a normal javascript object
[08:57:18] <Cork> clarkk: the exceptions are stated in api.jquery.com
[08:57:25] <Cork> clarkk: and they are few
[08:57:44] <Cork> is, attr, prop, hasClass
[08:57:51] <Cork> and 2-3 more
[08:58:02] <ernston> i managed to fix the start i think Whirl3d
[08:58:10] <clarkk> ok, because I couldn't see where it explicitly said that they returned jquery objects, I found it confusing
[08:58:36] <Cork> clarkk: they don't it works the other way around
[08:58:56] <clarkk> ok Cork, understood. Thank you
[08:59:02] <Cork> np
[08:59:31] <Cork> gryzor_: ya, but it is pointless to have a dedicated element just to hook an object on it
[08:59:41] <Cork> gryzor_: then you could just have the object straight of
[09:00:13] <Cork> gryzor_: var datastruct = { foo: 'bar', foo2: 'bar2' };
[09:00:26] <Cork> gryzor_: and then datastruct[$(this).val()]
[09:05:00] <amirite> can anyone suggest a way to get the absolute address of an element in the dom tree?
[09:05:11] <amirite> so i can save it, reload the page, and know the element again later
[09:05:22] <amirite> say for example the element is a TextNode or something without an id
[09:07:28] <amirite> window 3
[09:09:30] <mdev> how'd you guys learn jquery, books or just tuts?
[09:09:42] <Cork> amirite: you could prob do something with .parents()
[09:10:22] <Cork> mdev: api.jquery.com helps you if you know the basics, and learn.jquery.com is another good source
[09:11:57] <mdev> Thanks cork
[09:16:20] <clarkk> I wish to have anchors in a page that link to ids in the same page, but for them not to append the hash value to the URL and to not reload the page. Does anyone know the best way to go about this, please?
[09:16:55] <clarkk> also, when js is enabled, is there any way other than <a> anchors to jump to different sections in a page?
[09:21:37] <Cork> clarkk: # linkd won't reload the page
[09:22:21] <Cork> clarkk: also you can bind event listeners to them and to scroll animations if you like
[09:22:44] <Cork> clarkk: btw the hash jump is not related to a tags
[09:22:55] <Cork> clarkk: it can go do any id on the pge
[09:23:00] <Cork> *page
[09:23:00] <clarkk> Cork: ah
[09:23:09] <lolmaus> Is it possible to make a function execute whenever given element's size is changed?
[09:23:22] <Cork> lolmaus: not cross browsers
[09:23:39] <clarkk> Cork: but if it's on an element other than <a> it will still apend the id to the url, won't it?
[09:24:00] <Cork> clarkk: if you do it through the browsers has function yes
[09:24:22] <clarkk> Cork: what is a "has function"?
[09:24:23] <lolmaus> Cork, could you please tell me jQuery method name or something else to google up
[09:24:41] <Cork> clarkk: though $(document).on('click', 'a[href^="#"]', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[09:24:47] <Cork> could handle the js way
[09:25:05] <Cork> clarkk: when you add #<id> to the end of the url
[09:25:40] <Cork> lolmaus: only thing you can use is the resize event
[09:25:47] <Cork> ?g mdn event resize
[09:25:47] <b-ot> Cork: resize - Web technology reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/resize
[09:25:58] <Cork> lolmaus: but it only triggers for the browser window
[09:26:17] <Cork> lolmaus: but you shouldn't need to know it from anything else
[09:26:44] <clarkk> Cork: with that code above, you are just preventing the default behavior of an a link - so it won't jump to the id, aren't you?
[09:27:02] <Cork> ?g jquery.scrollTo
[09:27:03] <b-ot> Cork: Ariel Flesler: jQuery.ScrollTo → http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[09:27:20] <Cork> clarkk: just give the this.href to that function and it will animate it for you
[09:27:30] <Cork> clarkk: with effects if you like
[09:27:36] <lolmaus> Cork, what a jQuery widget resizes itself, thus altering the width of the element in question?
[09:27:57] <Cork> lolmaus: those are faked events
[09:28:12] <Cork> lolmaus: the widget knows about the size change and triggers those events
[09:30:05] <lolmaus> Cork, i mean that i have an element on the page. Some behavior (another widget's CSS manipulation or whatever) may cause this element to change its size without changing the window size. Is it possible to track that?
[09:34:42] <Cork> lolmaus: sure, but not through events or thought the dom
[09:34:59] <Cork> lolmaus: best would be to add a hook in the widget s
[09:35:14] <Cork> *widget that it can trigger when it does the change
[09:35:50] <lolmaus> Cork, so there's no chance to react to change if i don't know which other elements may force my element to resize?
[09:36:04] <Cork> lolmaus: nope
[09:36:32] <Cork> lolmaus: though you can construct your css so you might not have to
[09:37:31] <lolmaus> Cork, thank you for clarifications!

[09:46:04] <feyd> I'm using fancybox, I'm wondering if there's a way for it to fire only when an element is visible, so I did a condition for it if ($(element).is(':visible')) $.fancybox(); - but its not working, is this doable?
[09:47:55] <Cork> fy
[09:47:57] <Cork> opps
[09:48:22] <Cork> feyd: :visible only checks if the element is rendered, not if it's in view
[09:48:42] <Cork> feyd: you need to either write code that calculates this, or use a plugin
[09:48:47] <feyd> yea, so display:none should mean it's not visible, correct?
[09:48:58] <Cork> ya
[09:49:18] <feyd> so the condition is correct, it's just not going to work how I want
[09:49:47] <Cork> feyd: check so the element you're looking for isn't a clone of the element you test on
[09:49:53] <Cork> that could be why it fails
[09:49:58] <duch_kazatel> visibility: hidden; is another way to "hide" things.
[09:50:21] <feyd> but :visible would still see that as visible, because it checks if an element is taking up space
[09:50:31] <ernston> display: none;
[09:50:34] <ernston> if your friend here
[09:50:37] <Cork> feyd: no it checks a few css properties
[09:50:44] <Cork> not if it takes up space
[09:50:51] <feyd> ernston: im not trying to hide anything
[09:50:58] <duch_kazatel> just saying, visibility: hidden; is another css property that "hides" things.
[09:51:08] <duch_kazatel> it does not remove it from document flow like display: none;
[09:51:11] <Cork> feyd: and if the element is a clone, it will be a totally different element
[09:51:15] <feyd> i just want fancybox to fire only when an element is visible, which is changed by media query conditions
[09:51:37] <Cork> feyd: what triggers the check?
[09:51:51] <feyd> page load and window resize
[09:51:57] <Cork> might be it runs before the css applies or something
[09:52:25] <feyd> i doubt that, css is loaded in the header and js in the footer
[09:52:34] <Cork> feyd: try make an example of what you're trying to do in jsfiddle.net
[09:52:41] <feyd> on it
[09:52:48] <Cork> skip the media query
[09:58:22] <feyd> http://jsfiddle.net/tH5BK/
[09:58:24] <feyd> i did it anyway
[09:59:08] <feyd> oops, http://jsfiddle.net/tH5BK/1/
[09:59:16] <feyd> silly clause setup, fixed
[09:59:33] <feyd> http://jsfiddle.net/tH5BK/2/ ok there sorry, last time
[10:00:08] <feyd> esc closes the lightbox if that gets in your way
[10:01:20] <Cork> feyd: works fine here
[10:01:46] <feyd> there should be no lightbox if that black box is visible
[10:01:57] <feyd> so it isnt work
[10:01:58] <feyd> ing
[10:02:08] <Cork> well you arn't loading the fancybox plugin so that never loads
[10:02:24] <feyd> yes I do, just not the css for it, which isnt needed here
[10:03:09] <Cork> [19:03:03.765] TypeError: $(...).fancybox is not a function @ http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/:28
[10:03:12] <Cork> no you arn't
[10:03:27] <feyd> then how is that image showing up inline on the page?
[10:03:29] <Cork> feyd: the scripts goes into the external resources section
[10:03:29] <feyd> thats fancybox doing it
[10:03:36] <Cork> on the left
[10:03:54] <feyd> ok, i'll put it there, but its still functioning
[10:04:14] <feyd> http://jsfiddle.net/tH5BK/3/
[10:04:32] <feyd> now the lightbox isnt working
[10:04:41] <feyd> worked fine doing it the wrong way like I had it
[10:05:23] <feyd> http://jsfiddle.net/tH5BK/2/ - regardless of any errors that come up, thats most definitely an overlay that loads the image on click
[10:05:39] <feyd> the image even gets the fancybox-image class
[10:05:40] <Cork> right i forgot
[10:06:01] <Cork> jsfiddle is picky about the existance of the ?v= parts
[10:06:08] <feyd> yea looks like it
[10:06:10] <Cork> if you have that in the url it won't load it :/
[10:06:44] <feyd> http://jsfiddle.net/tH5BK/5/
[10:06:44] <feyd> there
[10:06:59] <feyd> ignore the errors, it works, but its still firing when the black box is visible
[10:07:01] <awc737_> this maybe a stupid question, but if I'm making a JS app with logic like this:
[10:07:04] <awc737_> if(user.hasPermission('admin')) { }
[10:07:15] <awc737_> and JS is client side, can't someone use the console to find and set that variable
[10:07:25] <Cork> feyd: btw you forgot to clock your a tag
[10:07:37] <Cork> uh...
[10:07:40] <Cork> CLOSE >_<
[10:07:42] <feyd> oh yea
[10:08:10] <Cork> awc737_: yes
[10:08:25] <Cork> awc737_: that's why you need to control those things server side too
[10:08:29] <feyd> http://jsfiddle.net/tH5BK/6/
[10:09:01] <Cork> awc737_: if you by js app, man like an app on a phone or similar; those run in a highten security state
[10:09:02] <ndimatteo> hey guys, can someone help me out with writing a regex for stripping down email addresses? I'm looking to get emailaccount@domain.com --> emailaccount-domain
[10:09:14] <Cork> awc737_: so you can't inject scripts in them like you can in normal webpages
[10:09:41] <Cork> ndimatteo: email regex is the hardest regex rule to write
[10:10:09] <Cork> ndimatteo: it is really complex to make one that doesn't invalidate valid emails or the other way around
[10:10:24] <ndimatteo> Cork: so there's no way to just get the first fragment before the extension, and everything before the @?
[10:10:32] <feyd> you just want to replace the @ with a hyphen and remove the domain suffix?
[10:10:39] <Cork> ndimatteo: you mean you just want to split the address?
[10:10:43] <Cork> no need for regex there
[10:10:52] <Cork> ndimatteo: just do string.split('@')
[10:11:04] <awc737_> that's good to know about mobile apps Cork
[10:11:08] <feyd> and you can split the domain portion of the returned array at the period
[10:11:11] <ndimatteo> Cork: yea, but I don't want the extension (i.e. - .com, .net. etc)
[10:11:21] <ndimatteo> feyd: I'm an idiot
[10:11:22] <ndimatteo> haha
[10:11:44] <Cork> ndimatteo: that becomes a bit more complicated but...
[10:12:06] <awc737_> this is just a website though, but OK. I'm no longer storing a currentUser object, and I'm going to make a server side request for things like inGroup(), hasPermission()
[10:12:27] <Rout> If someone can help me: i need to send a form data, via AJAX, and if its OK show a message "OK", without redirect...
[10:12:28] <Cork> ndimatteo: something like /^(.*)@(.*)\.[^.]*$/ might work
[10:12:29] <ndimatteo> Cork: hmmm, how would you recommend doing it?
[10:12:31] <Rout> someone can help me?
[10:12:40] <feyd> i'll be back later, if someone figures out my problem, I swear theres an awesome xerox copy of my nipple in it as reward
[10:13:09] <Cork> ndimatteo: simplest might just be to split on @ and then cut from the last dot on the second string
[10:13:25] <Cork> ndimatteo: and most likely the fastest too
[10:13:46] <boytoy> Does anybody know how to use Embedly's Services API (http://support.embed.ly/entries/23245603-Does-Embedly-have-a-whitelist-of-content-providers-) to restrict autoembedding to YouTube and Vimeo only? At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/29/edit it tries to autoembed random links and I'd prefer it didn't do that.
[10:15:08] <Cork> Rout: $.post(url, $('form').serialize(), function() { $('#ok').show(); });
[10:15:23] <Cork> Rout: or if also to bind it on the form
[10:15:47] <Cork> Rout: $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.post(url, $(this).serialize(), function() { $('#ok').show(); }); });
[10:15:51] <ndimatteo> Cork: if I want to do it that way, how would I split and then grab what's before the last period?
[10:16:18] <Rout> Cork: can i pvt u?
[10:16:27] <Cork> Rout: preferably not
[10:16:38] <Rout> Ok, i will try something here
[10:16:42] <ndimatteo> Cork: and is there a way to also check that there are no other periods, dashes, etc in it once it's grabbed? For example, if mail.domain.com is what the string is it's going to grab mail.domain, but I would need that dot stripped
[10:18:22] <Cork> ndimatteo: var email = "user@domain.tld"; var parts = email.split('@'); parts[1] = parts[1].substtring(0, parts[1].lastIndexOf('.') - 1);
[10:18:24] <Whirl3d> ernston, this is bulky, but done to show the logic through it. I think it works. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/135/
[10:18:39] <Cork> ndimatteo: opps var email = "user@domain.tld"; var parts = email.split('@'); parts[1] = parts[1].substring(0, parts[1].lastIndexOf('.') - 1);
[10:19:48] <Cork> ndimatteo: warning though there are tld's with dot's in them
[10:20:03] <Cork> so cutting at the last dot isn't safe
[10:20:21] <Cork> if that is why you plat to cut there
[10:20:59] <ndimatteo> Cork: true, hmm
[10:21:07] <ndimatteo> ok, different approach
[10:21:22] <ndimatteo> Cork: can we just grab the first string AFTER the '@' until it hits a period?
[10:21:23] <Cork> ndimatteo: if you want to separate domain name from tld there is only one safe way
[10:21:25] <Cork> (and it sucks)
[10:21:38] <Cork> ndimatteo: that's not safe either
[10:21:44] <ndimatteo> how come?
[10:21:47] <Cork> the domain might have a sub domain
[10:21:56] <Cork> support.domain.com
[10:22:14] <ndimatteo> ok, lets say I'm okay with that happening
[10:22:26] <Cork> ndimatteo: only safe way to do tld splitting is to have a full set of all tld's and then matching those
[10:22:36] <Cork> and when you've removed the largest match form the string
[10:22:41] <Rout> Cork: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/521846314 that didn't work ;//// wath i'm missing?
[10:22:42] <Cork> the rest is the domain
[10:23:47] <Cork> Rout: did you create the <p id="ok"></p> element?
[10:23:59] <Cork> Rout: the message should be positioned in the dom, and shown by js
[10:24:10] <Rout> i'm create a <div id='ok' style="display:none;">AAAAAAAAAAAAA</div>
[10:24:16] <Cork> ok
[10:24:29] <Cork> Rout: are you sure the url works?
[10:24:47] <Cork> looks like a file path
[10:25:06] <Cork> (url's has / not \)
[10:25:06] <ndimatteo> Cork: gotcha, but if I did want to get just the first fragment (everything after @ until it hits a period) how would I do that?
[10:25:29] <Rout> Thx that work
[10:25:29] <Rout> =)
[10:25:32] <Cork> ndimatteo: parts[1].split('.')[0]
[10:26:29] <alainus> I'm debugging a website that uses 1.2.6. They have this syntax for a selector: $("input[@name=productName]").val();
[10:26:38] <alainus> can anyone confirm that that syntax is no longer valid?
[10:26:52] <Cork> @ has never been valid as far as i know
[10:26:56] <Rout> Cork: sorry, i'm newby with Jquery, how i can change a innerHtml of a object?
[10:26:58] <Cork> the rest is ok though
[10:26:58] <ernston> how do you make something contain 2 pieces of data
[10:27:00] <ernston>           $matches = $(list).find(':Contains(' + filter + ')').parent();
[10:27:23] <ernston> i want to find which contains: filter   and rating
[10:27:25] <Cork> ernston: 1. contains is lowcase not camel
[10:27:38] <Cork> ernston: second use filter(function() {})
[10:27:43] <alainus> Cork, works on 1.2.6
[10:27:52] <ernston> camel ?
[10:28:11] <Cork> Ericx2x: CamelCase => lowercase
[10:28:16] <Cork> *ernston:
[10:28:26] <ernston> is that a coding term
[10:28:26] <alainus> Any way i can access the docs for 1.2.6 ?
[10:28:32] <ernston> ive not heard that term in typography
[10:28:42] <Cork> ernston: yes camelcase is a coding term
[10:28:48] <Cork> ?g camelcase
[10:28:48] <b-ot> Cork: CamelCase - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase
[10:29:52] <Cork> alainus: @ is used in xpath selectors, it has never been valid for css
[10:30:13] <alainus> Cork, from http://blog.jquery.com/2009/01/14/jquery-1-3-released/
[10:30:14] <Cork> alainus: if it worked in jquery before, it was cause it was filtered out
[10:30:15] <Rout> HOW i can change a html of a div, with JQUERY
[10:30:17] <alainus> http://blog.jquery.com/2009/01/14/jquery-1-3-released/
[10:30:22] <alainus> The @ in [@attr] has been removed. Deprecated since 1.2 this old syntax no longer works. Simply remove the @ to upgrade.
[10:30:25] <ernston> ffs ive broke it again
[10:30:47] <Cork> alainus: so it was an old xpath syntax
[10:31:08] <Cork> Rout: $('div').html('new html')
[10:31:08] <killer`toaster> Any idea why I keep getting a 404 on some "jquery.min.map" file? I'm not referencing it anywhere... screenshot: http://cl.ly/image/3o0u1N3o2f2d
[10:31:26] <Cork> killer`toaster: heh you are the second one today asking that XD
[10:31:39] <killer`toaster> Also, line 1 of that php file is just a doctype: http://cl.ly/image/3S0A25113P2q
[10:31:52] <killer`toaster> Cork: ah! :/ did you catch the answer by any chance?
[10:32:04] <Cork> killer`toaster: ya, as i was the one giving it :D
[10:32:15] <Cork> chrome tries to load .map for minified js files
[10:32:22] <Cork> chrome developer tools that is
[10:32:26] <killer`toaster> but my jquery.js is already minified
[10:32:41] <killer`toaster> so should I just ignore that error?
[10:32:58] <ernston> here is where am upto: http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/138/
[10:33:06] <Cork> killer`toaster: uh, it is CAUSE it is minified -_-'
[10:33:10] <duckgoose> just toss the map file in there
[10:33:14] <Whirl3d> ernston, I added comments to it for you
[10:33:20] <ernston> Whirl3d
[10:33:25] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/137/
[10:33:26] <ernston> am even more confused on your version
[10:33:33] <ernston> i added a variable then was not sure
[10:33:45] <Cork> killer`toaster: chrome developer tools detects that the file is minified, and tries to load a .map file to uglify it (make it readable in the debugger)
[10:33:53] <ernston> wow
[10:33:56] <Whirl3d> ernston, check out the comments
[10:34:00] <Cork> killer`toaster: you can disable that feature in chrome if you like
[10:34:02] <killer`toaster> Cork: ohh, wow, gotcha. So I guess I can just ignore it safely, right?
[10:34:11] <Cork> killer`toaster: or you can download the .map file from code.jquery.com
[10:34:19] <Cork> killer`toaster: ya you can
[10:34:25] <killer`toaster> Cork: thank you tons, sir
[10:34:36] <ernston>     NOTICE THE CHANGES TO THE MARKUP ?
[10:34:40] <ernston> in the html or the js
[10:34:48] <ndimatteo> Cork: thanks man
[10:34:48] <ernston> am assuming the js above the comment
[10:35:16] <jp-> is there a way to pass global: false to the ajax object autocomplete uses?
[10:35:19] <Whirl3d> ernston, I changed the names of your fields to use the same structure:  filter_{type}   so filter_term is the input, etc.
[10:35:47] <Wolf_22> In a jQuery .each() loop, how do you reference an element by an index? (I.e. - say you have multiple divs with a class name of ".whatever", you'd use something like .each(idx), but how do you use "idx" to reference a specific .whatever's within the .each structure?
[10:35:49] <Cork> jp-: no but you can override the ajax call and make it your self
[10:35:52] <ernston> my eyes are not very good, takes me time to find things, 1 min
[10:35:58] <Whirl3d> ernston, I change the html to add IDs named the same way for convenience
[10:35:59] <jp-> I don't see an obvious way, looking for something cleaner than a temporary variable for disabling the global ajaxStart() and ajaxStop() handlers.
[10:36:09] <Cork> jp-: give it a source function instead of an url
[10:36:16] <ernston> filter_services
[10:36:16] <jp-> Cork, thanks, I'll look at that instead.
[10:36:17] <ernston> i see
[10:36:42] <jhgaylor> I've been using jquery for a while and typically just ignore the 404's for y18.gif, s.gif, and grayarrow.gif, but not this time. However, I can't seem to find what they are/where they should be/why I don't have them.
[10:36:45] <Whirl3d> so, now you have filter_services   filter_term and filter_rating   instead of how you named them before
[10:37:33] <Cork> jhgaylor: jquery doesn't load any images at all
[10:37:47] <Cork> jhgaylor: jquery-ui has some in there css
[10:38:01] <Whirl3d> and I changed the parent container id to "list_results" to maintain consistency
[10:38:38] <Whirl3d> you can name them whatever you would like, this just made it easier to find them for me...
[10:38:42] <rainabba> I need to split an array to remove an item so I need that items index. I can successfully use jquery $.grep to find the item in the array and return it so I expected to be able to use myArray.indexOf(resultsFromGrep) to get the index, but I always get -1. I've also tried jQuery $.inArray() which says the type to search can be "Anything" (i'd expect indexOf to do the same given how JS treats
[10:38:42] <rainabba> objects and properties) but it also returns -1. How can I get the index of an object in an array having a reference to the object without a manual loop to parse all and hardcode the logic to check for internals vs just comparing objects?
[10:38:43] <jhgaylor> Cork: using jquery 1.10.2 I get this in my chrome console http://dpaste.com/1352092/
[10:39:08] <ernston> sorry door knocked
[10:39:17] <ernston> reading up now
[10:39:48] <ernston> i need to work on naming conventions
[10:40:07] <ernston> do you stick to l/c ?
[10:40:37] <Whirl3d> sometimes. I've been doing Word Press work, so now I use lots of _ and all lowercase
[10:40:44] <Al2> is there a way to create facebook-like image attachments - how they have it on their commenting?
[10:41:32] <ernston> when reading up on js and jquery i found many people show examples with u/c + l/c mixed
[10:41:41] <ernston> in css i am used to using all l/c
[10:42:24] <Whirl3d> in jquery, the convention to replace hyphens is camelCcase   so background-color (in css) becomes backgroundColor
[10:43:05] <ernston> backgroundColor works the same as background-color
[10:43:07] <ernston> ?:S
[10:43:17] <Cork> jhgaylor: just cause the call starts in jquery.js doens't mean it is done by jquery
[10:43:29] <Cork> jhgaylor: only that it was done THROUGH jquery
[10:43:41] <jhgaylor> Cork: good point.
[10:44:09] <ernston> thx Whirl3d
[10:44:27] <ernston> what must i do with the services filter now?
[10:44:43] <Whirl3d> ernston, in jquery, if you want to set background color in an object you would have to do {"background-color":"red"} which is ugly to me. So Jquery uses the syntax {backgroundColor:"red")    no quotes needed around the fieldname in the object that way
[10:44:47] <Whirl3d> either works
[10:44:55] <Cork> jhgaylor: searchNewestHN script.js:52 is where i would look
[10:45:19] <ernston> the services works on page load, but if you enter: abr
[10:45:45] <Whirl3d> 2 results, right?
[10:45:51] <ernston> yeah
[10:45:55] <Whirl3d> works for me
[10:46:05] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/140/
[10:46:07] <ernston> type: abr
[10:46:16] <ernston> try checkbox's
[10:46:24] <boytoy> Al2: like http://embed.ly/?
[10:46:27] <Whirl3d> abr works 2 results
[10:46:29] <ernston> i changed the json so that the shops dont have the same services
[10:46:39] <ernston> check box click should reduce to 1
[10:46:40] <nhulea> hey why wont my .append html run the customs(); function ? http://jsfiddle.net/bmR7a/1/ it seems like it should ??
[10:46:59] <nhulea> $("#gp_set_3 .gps1").append('<select id="gp_choice_1" name="6_12_gp_choice_1" class="sel-3" style="width: 308px; height: 26px;"> <option value="" selected="selected">Choose</option><option class="select" value="Guided Tours">Guided Tours</option></select>');
[10:47:04] <jhgaylor> cork: thanks.  turns out its a poorly written extension i installed.
[10:47:11] <nhulea> that one specifically
[10:47:17] <ernston> abraxas 1 + 2
[10:47:32] <NoiseEee> nhulea: where the heck is that in all that code?
[10:47:35] <ernston> 1 has 2 services, abraxas 2 has 1 service
[10:47:40] <NoiseEee> nhulea: what does your console say when you try?
[10:47:47] <ernston> on the example i pasted
[10:47:49] <nhulea> nothing
[10:47:50] <Al2> @boytoy - in a comment section - the field where you type up yoru comment it has a camera icon and when you click on it - lets user select file and then it displays it before actualy "submit" happens
[10:48:02] <nhulea> NoiseEee: its just aform I am building
[10:48:05] <nhulea> a form
[10:48:30] <NoiseEee> nhulea: okay and what does your console say / what error do you get?
[10:48:44] <Whirl3d> but they both have all three classes
[10:48:53] <nhulea> NoiseEee: thanks I am not getting an error in the console haha
[10:49:25] <nhulea> I think I need to call it again .customstyle();
[10:49:28] <ernston> jesus
[10:49:32] <ernston> am losing my marbles
[10:49:35] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ nhulea
[10:49:39] <ernston> i forget to edit 1 part
[10:50:13] <ernston> i forgot that i put the services in 2 places
[10:50:24] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/142/
[10:50:27] <ernston> works perfect i think
[10:50:30] <ernston> thanx Whirl3d so much
[10:50:43] <ernston> is there anything i need to do on this still?
[10:51:11] <ernston> i must ask
[10:51:13] <ernston>     this could more easily be written like:
[10:51:26] <ernston> you provided an alternative function
[10:51:28] <nhulea> NoiseEee: yeah cool thanks I think I got
[10:51:46] <ernston> same function written differently ?
[10:51:56] <ernston>     function updateList () {
[10:53:35] <clarkk> Cork: do you know why scrollTo would work in chrome but not in firefox?
[10:53:50] <clarkk> Cork: are there any alternative plugins I could try?
[10:56:02] <alainus> An embedded script is adding jQuery by it's own, using a version I don't want and breaking everything. Is there a way to solve this problem? (By wrapping it into it's own function somehow?)
[10:57:13] <awc737_> how to I return a value on a parent method, which contains an ajax function, from with .done() ?
[10:59:39] <awc737_> http://paste.laravel.com/L1F
[10:59:44] <awc737_> this does not return true or false
[10:59:47] <awc737_> it returns a promise object
[11:04:49] <boytoy> Al2: yeah i use embedly for my post/comment previews as well
[11:05:15] <boytoy> not for user uploads though, just for user urls
[11:05:58] <GreyTrilby> ok, totally the wrong forum this, but can anyone point me in the direction of a good php IRC channel? I need some help with a query and I can't find a decent channel to ask on!
[11:06:09] <shoky> awc737_: you can't just return a value. you have to keep using the promise callbacks. but you can pipe it with .then:   http://paste.laravel.com/L1G
[11:09:01] <shoky> GreyTrilby: how about ##php?
[11:09:03] <awc737_> thank you shoky
[11:09:17] <GreyTrilby> sadly that appears to be invite only!
[11:09:22] <GreyTrilby> but thatnks shoky!
[11:09:32] <awc737_> shoky, the inGroup method seems pointless then
[11:09:34] <shoky> GreyTrilby: it's not, you have to register your nick. type:  /msg nickserv help register
[11:09:39] <awc737_> I Need to place all that logic within obj.inGroup(somegroup).done(function(data) {
[11:09:46] <GreyTrilby> ahhh... ok.. I'll try that then!
[11:10:02] <shoky> awc737_: why? it does part of the job.  so you don't have to keep doing that logic just to get that true/false
[11:10:17] <GreyTrilby> shoky - you're a gent *tips hat*
[11:10:37] <awc737_> shoky, ok, but in this line: obj.inGroup(somegroup).done(function(data) {
[11:10:41] <shoky> awc737_: if you don't need to reuse it at all then maybe its kinda pointless ok
[11:10:43] <awc737_> data will = true or false? based on how my method is
[11:10:47] <awc737_> I do want to reuse it
[11:11:02] <shoky> awc737_: dont understand your question
[11:11:13] <ernston> Whirl3d is there a way we dont have to have the $(function above the pageinit ?
[11:11:36] <awc737_> well first of all shoky , inGroup is not a jquery ajax method
[11:11:38] <Whirl3d> why is that?
[11:11:39] <awc737_> so how can I do obj.inGroup(somegroup).done(
[11:11:48] <shoky> awc737_:   .done  is something you can call on a promise
[11:11:54] <awc737_> oh
[11:12:16] <shoky> awc737_:  ajax calls are promises, but you can make your own promises, like i'm doing with .then
[11:12:53] <ernston> am trying to get the jsfiddle example working on my offline example
[11:13:16] <ernston> the rating overrides the search offline :(
[11:13:29] <awc737_> oh shoky I just realized changing .done to .then where you did that changed the behavior
[11:13:40] <shoky> yeah. you should read the docs for .then
[11:13:49] <awc737_> .done was returning the findGroups data, and .then was returning the true / false I wanted
[11:14:11] <shoky> .then makes a new promise, whose "data" is the new thing you return from the .then callback
[11:14:22] <awc737_> that's awesome, that makes sense now
[11:14:28] <shoky> awesome
[11:14:39] <ernston> the search input + services work together
[11:14:45] <ernston> but rating slider appears to reset
[11:15:21] <Rout> Corki: hey sorry, can u help me? i'm on a Sale form, that u need put, Product, and Costumer, and have a button to create a new costumer, if o click on the button, open on a lightbox, and via ajax, a new costumer form... but, if costumer has been added, i need to show a message on light box, and hide the form,, http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1359205113 <- that is my jquery code, that work if i open (not via AJAX) the new costumer form. but

[11:16:37] <ernston> strange
[11:17:00] <codevinsky> alright.
[11:17:03] <ernston> actually no
[11:17:10] <codevinsky> how do i bind to a dom element that doesn't exist yet?
[11:17:12] <ernston> Whirl3d i found a slight problem:
[11:17:14] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/142/
[11:18:38] <shoky> codevinsky: you can't. but if you're talking about binding an event listener, you can delegate it to an ancestor element with .on()  e.g.  $('#container').on('click', '.dynamicElement', function...)
[11:19:19] <codevinsky> shoky: excellent thank you
[11:19:20] <Rout> Cork: hey sorry, can u help me? i'm on a Sale form, that u need put, Product, and Costumer, and have a button to create a new costumer, if o click on the button, open on a lightbox, and via ajax, a new costumer form... but, if costumer has been added, i need to show a message on light box, and hide the form,, http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1359205113 <- that is my jquery code, that work if i open (not via AJAX) the new costumer form. but.

[11:19:30] <ernston> search input: abraxas
[11:19:40] <ernston> then click the slider, it shows any with the rating,
[11:19:46] <ernston> i thought it was working :9
[11:21:00] <ernston> if you move the slider it disregards the search input
[11:25:43] <Whirl3d> what is listview?
[11:26:26] <ernston> jquery mobile thing
[11:27:16] <ernston> am looking at the code around: if (parseInt(rating,10)>0)
[11:27:21] <ernston> cant work out why it overrides
[11:27:24] <Whirl3d> I just don't like your :contains expression
[11:27:33] <Whirl3d> lemme see if I can fix that
[11:27:46] <ernston> i dont like js
[11:27:54] <ernston> this was meant to be a jquery project
[11:29:45] <Whirl3d> ugggh. listview is a big deal. Gimme a minute to read up on it.
[11:38:16] <feyd> anyone know how I can get a lightbox to not trigger based on another elements visibility? here's my example, the lightbox works everytime you click the dog, but I want it to work only when the red box at the bottom isn't visible: http://jsfiddle.net/tH5BK/6/
[11:38:43] <feyd> which shows up when the window is under 400px, if youre confused at all
[11:40:00] <guideX> how do I do something like $(".sel[data1='1']:contains('Blah: ')").html().replace("Blah:", "Faa:"); but with data2='0' as a second attribute?
[11:42:40] <madabyss> Hey guys, can I get a little help with this toggle() issue. Haven't found anything useful on google. I'm trying to make a click event toggle to elements but it's only toggling one: http://pastebin.com/qwMq9kFN
[11:48:58] <NoiseEee> madabyss: its been removed in 1.9+
[11:49:10] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/ @ madabyss
[11:49:31] <madabyss> NoiseEee: Oh really, I wonder why. That was a useful function
[11:54:35] <ernston> am back
[11:54:38] <ernston> had to sort food out
[11:54:51] <ernston> what page are you reading from Whirl3d
[11:56:45] <ernston> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/demos/widgets/listviews/ ?

[12:04:46] <Spami> but when I try to delete them $('.contractor-gallery-picture a').click(function() { $(this).parent().remove();} for some reason it never call the function
[12:16:47] <boytoy> damn why does text truncation have to be so hard
[12:19:18] <boytoy> I'm trying to achieve professional truncation similar to Quora. Am I on the right path? http://jsbin.com/okahum/65/
[12:24:49] <NoiseEee> boytoy: it should break on the word, no?
[12:24:56] <fllr> how can I create an event that notifies me when a certain div finished loading?
[12:24:57] <NoiseEee> boytoy: as opposed to in the middle of a word?  like helico...
[12:26:35] <boytoy> NoiseEee: yep
[12:27:06] <boytoy> i reckon Quora use their own custom made one
[12:31:37] <boytoy> NoiseEee: completed the first step: http://jsbin.com/okahum/66/edit
[12:32:16] <espen__> I have a page with classes like this:  <div class="isbn 1234567">. If two identical classes exists, I want to remove the last ones. Is this possible somehow ?
[12:34:50] <boytoy> espen__: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4155782/can-i-remove-just-the-last-added-class-from-an-element-with-jquery maybe?
[12:35:24] <espen__> boytoy: Thanks.... reading ....
[12:35:34] <fllr> how can I create an event that notifies me when an element finished loading?
[12:35:47] <ernston> Whirl3d any luck?
[12:35:58] <boytoy> fllr: you mean like imagesLoaded?
[12:36:03] <NoiseEee> espen__: your selector would return two; remove the last
[12:37:29] <fllr> boytoy: Yeah, but for a div... I'm adding a div into the dom, and trying to check for its height, but I'm getting 0 since it's not rendered yet.
[12:37:30] <espen__> NoiseEee: the problem is that I might have 10 classes with "isbn"  and I dont know beforehand what (number) "1234567" will be
[12:37:52] <Ansikt> Hi.  I can't get IE9 to clear cache during ajax requests.  I've got cache:false set on ajax, AND I am using a time stamp at the end of the url, AND it's POST, and the page I'm going to has the pragma and cache-control http-equiv tags s
[12:37:55] <Ansikt> *set
[12:38:03] <Ansikt> Does anyone know what might be wrong
[12:38:09] <NoiseEee> espen__: so im not sure what you're asking?
[12:38:29] <boytoy> fllr: Oh like that I see
[12:38:46] <Ansikt> Also, I know that cache is the problem, because when I turn off cache on the browser, then my responses look correct.
[12:40:25] <ngharo> Ansikt: you could add some random fuzz to the request url like '?_fuzz=' + new Date().getTime()
[12:40:59] <Ansikt> ngharo: Sadly, I'm doing that.  That's what I meant by 'a time stamp at the end of the url'.
[12:41:15] <ngharo> oh, i missed that part.  wtf that's odd
[12:41:35] <ngharo> are you adding the timestamp as a post param or to the actual url?
[12:41:45] <fllr> boytoy: Do you know how?
[12:41:51] <espen__> NoiseEee: (sorry). I have a list (of books). The class is always "isbn.somenumber", and I dont know which number it is (I will be an EAN kode). If two items happens to have the same class, I want to remove the last. I assume I have to loop through all classes that are "isbn" and then check if its class exists somewhere else
[12:42:11] <Ansikt> ngharo: adding it to the actual URL, though I think at the end it's the same thing.  Isn't this what cache:false does behind the scenes anyway?
[12:43:00] <ngharo> not sure what cache option does behind the scene
[12:43:35] <NoiseEee> espen__: this is happening when?  you're about to add a new book and you're checking if it exists?  or you are iterating over a complete listing of books?
[12:44:46] <boytoy> fllr: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/waiting-for-a-dom-element-to-become-available maybe
[12:45:30] <fllr> boytoy: Ah, thanks. I'll check that out! :)
[12:46:03] <espen__> NoiseEee:  When there is a "promotion book" at top of page, I want to hide it if it happens to be on that page already
[12:46:32] <NoiseEee> espen__: and this is a generated page, or a promotion book is being loaded after initial page render?
[12:47:13] <espen__> NoiseEee: everything is present (in html) before the script  should run
[12:48:06] <NoiseEee> espen__: so first you need to grab the EAN number of the promoted book then i guess?
[12:48:27] <ngharo> if it's being generated, i would just catch it in the backend
[12:50:19] <Ansikt> Here's what that function looks like.  Does anyone see any blatant problems with it?
[12:50:20] <Ansikt> http://pastie.org/8257634
[12:51:12] <espen__> NoiseEee: I assume I can manage to add a class to the promoted book (so promoted.isbn.somenumber should remove from DOM isbn.somenumbr[2]  ??
[12:52:33] <NoiseEee> well if you can manage to add a class espen__, then sure, you could $('isbn.somenumber').remove();
[12:52:49] <NoiseEee> espen__: isbn.somenumber != promted.isbn.somenumber
[12:53:52] <espen__> thanks , will try
[12:54:24] <Moleboy> I'm relatively new to jquery/web dev in general, and had an idea
[12:54:45] <boytoy> I'm trying to achieve professional truncation similar to Quora. At http://jsbin.com/okahum/67/edit -- how do I turn off smartTruncation() when clicking .read_more?
[12:55:10] <Moleboy> I was wondering if you could use jquery with an html "select", and when you click different options, a table's results change
[12:55:14] <Moleboy> does that make sense?
[12:55:30] <ngharo> ?onchange @ Moleboy
[12:55:40] <Moleboy> Or would that not be a query-esq thing
[12:56:10] <Moleboy> ngharo: yea, so you have a drop down, click a different option, and a table that you have shows different results depending on what option you're on
[12:56:43] <ngharo> yep, you want to bind an change handler to the select menu
[12:56:44] <ngharo> ?change
[12:56:50] <ngharo> ugh, how do i b-ot
[12:57:03] <Moleboy> !change
[12:57:10] <Moleboy> uh
[12:57:14] <Moleboy> I'm outta bullets
[12:57:26] <ngharo> http://api.jquery.com/change/
[12:57:30] <Ansikt> ngaro:  HA!  FOUND IT!  There was nothing wrong with that method, someone had attached a handler on another part of the page would call A DIFFERENT function which would then overwrite that div with 302'd data
[12:57:35] <Ansikt> Thanks everybody!
[12:57:42] <Moleboy> ngharo: thanks! I'll look into it!
[12:57:44] <ngharo> yay
[12:58:49] <Moleboy> ngharo: oh my gosh, that's exactly what I was looking for. You deserve 3 cookies. Fresh cookies. Chocolate Chip variety.

[13:01:03] <boytoy> If I do $(this).smartTruncate(); -- how do I later turn off smartTruncate() for $(this)?

[13:02:22] <boytoy> pretty cool huh :p
[13:04:43] <duckgoose> truncation I've always wanted
[13:04:55] <duckgoose> never been arsed to do it
[13:05:08] <boytoy> :D
[13:05:17] <boytoy> well there ya go

[13:09:43] <nicetry> Hey there - I'm using twitter bootstrap, and its scrollspy feature.  I was wondering if there was a way to turn it on and off on a page. So far I can only figure out how to turn it on.
[13:10:02] <t0th_-> hi
[13:10:05] <t0th_-> any jquery mobile?
[13:10:08] <t0th_-> i have a listview
[13:17:30] <ngharo> cool story
[13:17:41] <Wanfu> anyone seen some kind of a script that with resizable, to resize elements beside it (make it smaller or bigger tofit), like a table. All the ones I hve seen are actual tables tho, i am doing it with divs, changing width and height. ty
[13:20:02] <t0th_-> with ajax i append the result in listview
[13:20:11] <t0th_-> fisrt time works, but when try again is not work
[13:21:56] <boytoy> Wanfu: you mean jQuery UI Resizable?
[13:22:12] <boytoy> or you want it to resize multiple divs simultaneously?
[13:22:15] <t0th_-> any?
[13:22:16] <t0th_-> please
[13:22:51] <Wanfu> boytoy, yes. I am wanting to resize elements, say like 2 divs side by side, total width of 900.. they will always fit, so it will automaticlaly make the other one smaller if I make the 1st wider
[13:23:12] <Wanfu> all staying within the size of a set sized container div
[13:23:58] <boytoy> hmm.. could this be achieved with CSS flexbox maybe?
[13:24:07] <boytoy> i dont know Wanfu, interesting problem though!
[13:24:32] <nicetry> Hey guys, I'm trying to figure out how to turn jquery/bootstraps scrollspy on, and then off again. Can anyone help me figure out the 'off' part?
[13:24:57] <Wanfu> I also noticed the http://jqueryui.com/resizable/#constrain-area does not work, for height.. only width..
[13:31:41] <clarkk> I need to perform .each() on the dom, and then a sub-each() on what that returns. Can anyone guide me to a doc that can help with this please?
[13:32:27] <clarkk> the problem is that the selector starts from document, rather than the structure returned from the each loop
[13:33:17] <t0th_-> i have a ajax to populate a listview in jquery mobile, ajax works fine and populate listview first time, if i submit again the form ajax get the data i put it in listview but is not showed

[13:43:36] <t0th_-> you are a great man
[13:44:19] <Wanfu> t0th_-, its very hard to debug code if you cant see it.. so, you need to paste the part that isnt working.. ppl cant debug code they cant change
[13:45:30] <t0th_-> http://jsbin.com/iHUm/1/
[13:45:32] <t0th_-> thanks
[13:45:39] <ngharo> imo I prefer the real live site over jsbin snippits
[13:45:45] <ngharo> anyone with a modern browser can change code in realtime
[13:46:53] <t0th_-> ngharo: canhelp me?
[13:47:05] <ngharo> t0th_-: is the code not executing at all (as in you don't get any console.log() output) when your bug occurs?
[13:47:19] <t0th_-> i get
[13:47:24] <t0th_-> i append to listview
[13:47:28] <t0th_-> but is not showed
[13:47:45] <t0th_-> only fist submit work
[13:47:49] <t0th_-> first
[13:47:58] <ngharo> and the bug only occurs on ios?
[13:48:07] <ngharo> because it works fine here on chrome
[13:48:48] <t0th_-> no
[13:48:53] <t0th_-> you test?
[13:49:36] <ngharo> can you remove the password protection on your page
[13:50:35] <t0th_-> ok
[13:50:37] <t0th_-> one minute
[13:50:50] <wongon> is there any difference between using single or double quotes in jQuery?
[13:50:51] <t0th_-> please can test
[13:51:37] <ngharo> wongon: makes no difference in javascript
[13:53:35] <t0th_-> ngharo:
[13:53:36] <t0th_-> works
[13:53:49] <t0th_-> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/refresh-page-like-refreshing-listviews
[13:54:39] <t0th_-> $.mobile.fixedToolbars.show(true);
[13:54:44] <t0th_-> i dont know why
[13:54:50] <ngharo> cool, whatever works :)
[13:54:53] <t0th_-> i have this error in console  Cannot call method 'show' of undefined
[13:54:57] <t0th_-> and works
[13:55:02] <t0th_-> if i remove this line, is not work
[13:55:05] <t0th_-> strange
[13:55:06] <t0th_-> ehehehe
[13:55:33] <wongon> so I should pick to use either single or double, then stick with it rather than having a mix?
[13:55:42] <Spami> Hey guys, I display inputs on the fly with jquery: $('.new_gallery').append('<span class="contractor-gallery-picture"><img src="'+images[i].url+'/convert?&amp;w=160&h=110"><input id="gallery_gallery_name" name="gallery[photos][image]['+images[i].url+']" type="text" value="'+images[i].name+'"><br /><a>delete</a></span>')
[13:55:44] <Spami> but when I try to delete them $('.contractor-gallery-picture a').click(function() { $(this).parent().remove();} for some reason it never call the function
[13:56:26] <Wanfu> wongon, doesnt matter
[13:56:27] <ngharo> wongon: yeah it's up to you but i'd stick with one for standards sake
[13:56:58] <ngharo> Spami: use on() delegate syntax instead of click()
[13:57:00] <t0th_-> ngharo:
[13:57:02] <t0th_-> problems
[13:57:17] <Wanfu> Spami, does the click function get called, tried a console.log() in there?
[13:57:36] <Spami> Wanfu,  nope it's not
[13:57:55] <ngharo> because your elements are being appended to the dom after you register the click handler
[13:58:05] <ngharo> click isn't aware of new elements
[13:58:11] <ngharo> on() can be
[13:58:11] <Wanfu> Spami, what version of jquery?
[13:58:42] <Spami> 1.8.7
[13:59:23] <Wanfu> does 1.8.7 have .on ?  not sure.. if not, you need to use .delegate, because its made later, like ngharo said
[13:59:28] <ngharo> Spami: $('.new_gallery').on('click', '.contractor-gallery-picture a', function() { $(this).parent().remove(); });
[13:59:34] <ngharo> yes it does
[13:59:39] <Spami> Wanfu,  yes it does have on, I us somewhere else
[13:59:49] <Wanfu> Spami, there ya go then, use .on
[14:00:52] <Wanfu> I still use 1.5.2 mostly, I am in the past :)
[14:01:33] <Spami> ngharo,  thanks it works
[14:02:30] <Spami> why click isn't aware of new elements ? Seems weird to me
[14:03:04] <ngharo> $('.foo').click() attaches a onclick attribute to everyone .foo in the DOM at the time it was called
[14:03:29] <beachandbytes> Spami, you will have to add a listner to a parent element or add it when you create the new element
[14:03:45] <Spami> ok
[14:03:48] <Spami> make sense
[14:04:44] <wongon> if I factor out some common code from within a $(document).ready() block into a separate function, should I define that function outside or inside the ready() block ?  Does the function need to be defined at a line above where it's called?
[14:05:00] <ngharo> $('.parent').on('click', '.foo') relies on events bubbling up to .parent
[14:05:07] <ngharo> read more on event bubbling in the googles
[14:05:18] <t0th_-> any can help again?
[14:05:19] <t0th_-> is not work
[14:05:20] <t0th_-> :(
[14:05:27] <t0th_-> ngharo: ?
[14:05:34] <ngharo> t0th_-: just ask
[14:05:41] <ngharo> be specific
[14:05:42] <t0th_-> same problem
[14:05:53] <ngharo> t0th_-: i couldn't reproduce it in my browser
[14:05:58] <ngharo> so i'm afraid i'm not much help
[14:06:01] <t0th_-> i can help you
[14:06:03] <t0th_-> oks
[14:06:05] <ngharo> unless i'm not understanding the problem
[14:06:05] <whyameye> I am using query mobile and I need different colored buttons. I know I can do this with themes and swatches but it seems overkill if I need just 1 red button, 1 blue button etc. Is there an easier way?
[14:06:28] <t0th_-> if you access the website you can seed
[14:06:35] <t0th_-> i can help you to reproduce the problem
[14:06:57] <ngharo> whyameye: you should be able to just apply styles to classes willy nilly, but i used jquery mobile theme creator and just made a bunch of extras even for one offs like a button
[14:07:49] <wongon> ?
[14:08:40] <ngharo> wongon: depends on the scope you want but you can probably just put it inside the ready()
[14:09:53] <whyameye> ngharo: I tried given the button an id and setting the background-color of the id in my css but that doesn't seem to work. Is this what you mean?
[14:12:49] <ngharo> i bet the html is being mangled and the element with the ID isn't really the one you want to style
[14:13:11] <ngharo> maybe you're screwed without using some fancy css selectors
[14:13:38] <t0th_-> any?
[14:14:23] <whyameye> ngharo: nm it does work after all. I was using background-color but apparently should have just been using background.
[14:14:47] <ngharo> ok cool
[14:14:50] <wongon> does the function need to be defined above where it is called?
[14:16:09] <NoiseEee> no wongon
[14:16:23] <ngharo> wongon: http://jsfiddle.net/uqq7x/
[14:17:45] <wongon> how do I see the console to run the JS?
[14:18:10] <NoiseEee> wongon: in chrome, ctrl-shift-j
[14:18:55] <NoiseEee> wongon: otherwise, in FF, firebug
[14:22:46] <wongon> thx
[14:23:52] <kamo> hello channel
[14:24:06] <kamo> I feel so like a NOOB asking this
[14:24:38] <kamo> But how do you remove the Hover event from a DOM object
[14:24:56] <ngharo> unbind()
[14:25:29] <boytoy> Does anybody know how to use Embedly's Services API (http://support.embed.ly/entries/23245603-Does-Embedly-have-a-whitelist-of-content-providers-) to restrict autoembedding to YouTube and Vimeo only? At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/29/edit it tries to autoembed random links and that's not cool.
[14:27:01] <kamo> @ngharo
[14:27:11] <kamo> Example please
[14:27:18] <miCSu> kamo: u might need to unbind mouseover and mouseout
[14:27:56] <miCSu> if hover's attached with .on method, you could unbind it with .off
[14:28:18] <kamo> nice thank you miCSu
[14:28:44] <miCSu> if I remember correctly, with .live the unbind was .die
[14:28:57] <miCSu> which makes sense
[14:29:12] <kamo> I have quit using live since it has been deprecated
[14:29:15] <kamo> :)
[14:32:25] <xenaxon> hi
[14:32:34] <xenaxon> has anybody worked with typehead.js ?
[14:32:46] <miCSu> beware that there's also mouseenter and mouseleave events
[14:32:52] <miCSu> ^kamo
[14:36:48] <jsc802> does someone feel like helping me out
[14:37:07] <jsc802> i cannot for the life of me get the infinite scroll plugin to work
[14:37:18] <jsc802> http://reddit-recommended-gifts.atara.net/
[14:41:40] <ngharo> jsc802: you're including two versions of jquery in that page
[14:41:46] <ngharo> might want to start with fixing that
[14:42:45] <t0th_-> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/submit-form-other-only-works-first-time
[14:44:34] <Tomashe> hey guys

[14:48:10] <Tomashe> hmm yes i tried that plug in but couldnt make it work
[14:48:12] <Tomashe> :/
[14:50:52] <c4ptnh00k> Tomashe: why not?
[14:52:14] <Tomashe> from some reason it was not working
[14:52:26] <Tomashe> hmm i could not understand that page2 thing and page3..
[14:52:37] <Tomashe> or i was not in  so much focus when i read the instructions LOL
[14:53:27] <c4ptnh00k> Tomashe: Well it (in my opinion) is the best plugin for what you are wanting to do
[14:55:10] <jsc802> im giving up on infinite scroll
[14:55:35] <jsc802> can someone help me fix masonry on my page :@
[14:55:36] <jsc802> http://reddit-recommended-gifts.atara.net/cat/toys
[14:57:08] <Tomashe> pl  o ow;; tru agaom
[14:59:13] <c4ptnh00k> jsc802: more pointed questions with specifics get more specific answers
[15:00:44] <c4ptnh00k> jsc802: you commented out most of your in-line js
[15:05:57] <jsc802> i fixed it :)
[15:06:06] <jsc802> now time to try for infinite scroll again
[15:09:48] <boytoy> jsc802: https://github.com/kpheasey/jqm.infinitescroll or which one?
[15:10:44] <jsc802> www.infinite-scroll.com
[15:13:45] <Tomashe> i got ome question regarding infinite scroll
[15:13:52] <Tomashe> i saw there is a way to use it with json
[15:14:08] <Tomashe> so after i got to bottom it send json req and get the new data and place it , am i correct?
[15:14:12] <Tomashe> https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll
[15:14:16] <Tomashe> look at the bottom
[15:14:38] <Tomashe> but where does it send the json post?
[15:16:05] <Tomashe> the docs are very bad.. there is no reference to where do i get the new data from
[15:21:23] <jsc802> ok heres a question
[15:21:32] <jsc802> At say http://reddit-recommended-gifts.atara.net/cat/home/
[15:21:50] <jsc802> How can I get the items loaded to the bottom dynamically to still have the hover effect?
[15:22:00] <jsc802> I changed it to .on("hover" but no dice
[15:22:21] <pixelpimp> that URL is so ambiguous... do I assume /cat means category because it's e-commerce, or do I assume /cat means kittens because reddit?
[15:22:35] <jsc802> lol
[15:22:43] <jsc802> i should change it to category
[15:26:02] <xenaxon> has anyone worked with typehead.js
[15:26:03] <xenaxon> please
[15:26:17] <xenaxon> I can't get the second example to work
[15:26:32] <boytoy> jsc802: u really think that stuff is gonna make u money?
[15:26:40] <beachandbytes> jsc802, change it to
[15:26:40] <xenaxon> http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
[15:26:41] <beachandbytes> $('.container').on('hover', '.post', function () { $(this).closest('.post').find('.caption').toggle(); });
[15:26:42] <boytoy> im not sure it will but gl though
[15:27:01] <xenaxon> http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
[15:27:04] <jsc802> no i doubt it will make me any money
[15:27:14] <xenaxon> any idea why the second example doesnt work on my localhost
[15:27:18] <jsc802> but maybe enough for beer
[15:27:19] <xenaxon> someone? anyone?
[15:27:23] <boytoy> jsc802: hehe
[15:27:48] <beachandbytes> he might make a ton of money who knows
[15:27:52] <beachandbytes> at least hes shipping :)
[15:28:10] <xenaxon> guys
[15:28:15] <xenaxon> can anyone help me out?
[15:28:17] <xenaxon> http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
[15:28:25] <jsc802> hey that worked thanks :)
[15:28:33] <xenaxon> I've succesfully setup the first example, but the second example doesnt work as expected
[15:28:34] <beachandbytes> what do you need help with xanaxon
[15:28:52] <xenaxon> beachandbytes: check the example
[15:28:54] <xenaxon> http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
[15:29:05] <beachandbytes> I see the example do you have a js fiddle?
[15:29:11] <beachandbytes> or an example of what you are trying to do
[15:29:17] <xenaxon> I didnt set it up on jsfiddle just a sec
[15:29:21] <xenaxon> ill set it up
[15:29:25] <xenaxon> im just trying to copy the same thing
[15:29:28] <xenaxon> on my localhost
[15:29:34] <xenaxon> so that I can implement it on my own script
[15:29:45] <xenaxon> it does work, but it doesn't display the 3 paragraphs
[15:29:54] <xenaxon> just 1
[15:30:37] <boytoy> beachandbytes: hes shipping?!
[15:31:06] <beachandbytes> hes building something to try and make a buck
[15:31:39] <boytoy> oh like that
[15:31:55] <xenaxon> beachandbytes: how do I load a js in jsfiddle
[15:31:56] <boytoy> yes he is
[15:31:59] <xenaxon> I mean a plugin
[15:32:00] <boytoy> i think he's gonna make it
[15:33:23] <boytoy> by the looks of his beer store he does speak the language of money. so like 50-100 more tries like that and he'll be golden
[15:33:33] <boytoy> @HouseShoes 3 Aug
[15:33:33] <boytoy> Stop worrying abt what a rich motherfucker is doing and start figuring out how not to be a broke bastard.
[15:33:36] <boytoy> Retweeted by boytoy
[15:33:45] <jsc802> hehe
[15:34:20] <xenaxon> ok
[15:34:45] <xenaxon> beachandbytes: here's the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rn4Jr/
[15:34:56] <jsc802> its hard to get rich
[15:35:06] <jsc802> heres the other one im working on www.funsplora.com/
[15:35:19] <ernston> Whirl3d you still here?
[15:35:33] <Gmac_> i think my jquery pop out which prevents default is stopping users from being able to select all with cmd + a or ctrl + a
[15:36:30] <xenaxon> beachandbytes: http://jsfiddle.net/rn4Jr/2/
[15:37:02] <jvost> Can jquery report back all properties of a field?
[15:37:29] <jvost> in particular, a select field?
[15:37:41] <Gmac_> so how can i fix that?
[15:38:06] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/rn4Jr/4/
[15:40:08] <xenaxon> can anyone check my jsfiddle and tell me why it's not working as expected?
[15:41:02] <doug65536> xenaxon: fiddle wasn't loading jquery http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rn4Jr/6/
[15:41:54] <doug65536> xenaxon: oh I see what you did. there is an easier way to load jquery, at the top
[15:41:56] <xenaxon> doug65536: it's till not working: http://jsfiddle.net/rn4Jr/8/
[15:42:29] <doug65536> xenaxon: what am I supposed to do to make the bug happen
[15:42:37] <xenaxon> what?
[15:42:38] <xenaxon> :D
[15:42:58] <xenaxon> doug65536: i've removed the external jquery, and added it at the top
[15:43:03] <doug65536> am I supposed to reengineer the whole thing?
[15:43:09] <doug65536> reverse-engineer*(
[15:43:21] <xenaxon> doug65536: not really, the problem is with that join() method
[15:43:24] <xenaxon> it's not working
[15:43:45] <xenaxon> actually, on jsfiddle it doesnt work at all
[15:43:53] <xenaxon> it should drop down a suggestion list
[15:43:59] <xenaxon> below the input
[15:44:05] <xenaxon> it's working ok on my localhost
[15:44:07] <xenaxon> wait a sec
[15:46:18] <xenaxon> http://dithemes.com/test/
[15:46:39] <xenaxon> doug65536: check it out on this live host
[15:48:54] <blindMoe> xenaxon: data/repos.json doesn't exist and you can't use require() outside of Node.js
[15:49:58] <xenaxon> blindMoe: I know, I forgot to change the folder when I uploaded. I fixed it
[15:50:02] <xenaxon> blindMoe: check now
[15:50:06] <xenaxon> blindMoe: http://dithemes.com/test/
[15:50:24] <xenaxon> just type in "a" and you should see the dropdown with suggestions
[15:50:50] <blindMoe> ahh now I see it
[15:51:16] <xenaxon> blindMoe: it should be working like the second example here: http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
[15:51:47] <xenaxon> but it's not displaying the other info, it's not joining everything together. it's only showing the suggestion text
[15:52:46] <xenaxon> i think it's because I removed the part with ".join(''), engine: Hogan "
[15:53:07] <xenaxon> blindMoe: but if I leave that part there, then it doesn't work at all. I think it breaks
[15:53:35] <blindMoe> hrmm well hogan is a node.js component I believe
[15:53:48] <blindMoe> at least the hogan you have is
[15:54:58] <xenaxon> ?
[15:55:00] <doug65536> xenaxon: what join?
[15:55:03] <xenaxon> i don't know hogan
[15:55:10] <xenaxon> no idea what it does
[15:55:18] <xenaxon> is it necessary ?
[15:55:25] <xenaxon> it's something that has to do with templating
[15:55:41] <xenaxon> doug65536 the join is removed on my live site
[15:55:48] <xenaxon> but it's there in the example
[15:55:58] <xenaxon> here, I'll add it to the live site
[15:56:24] <xenaxon> ok, done. check it out now. now it doesn't work at all
[15:58:23] <xenaxon> even if I add the hogan.js to the script, it still doesn't work
[16:00:20] <doug65536> xenaxon: you know join makes a string, right?
[16:00:31] <doug65536> xenaxon: you aren't mixing it up with concat?
[16:00:47] <xenaxon> doug65536, I just copied the example code
[16:00:51] <xenaxon> I didn't mess with it at all
[16:00:54] <xenaxon> it's the same thing
[16:01:13] <xenaxon> I just want to reproduce the exact same thing on this blank page
[16:01:22] <xenaxon> so that I can implement it /restyle it the way I want
[16:01:49] <xenaxon> problem is, the plugin isn't echoing all the data, it's giving out only the suggestion text
[16:01:53] <xenaxon> look at the paragraphs
[16:03:32] <doug65536> xenaxon: the join isn't there in your live site
[16:03:41] <xenaxon> I deleted it now
[16:03:44] <xenaxon> the join
[16:03:51] <xenaxon> type in "a"
[16:03:56] <xenaxon> inthee input, and it works
[16:04:21] <xenaxon> but it doesnt display all the information
[16:04:25] <xenaxon> like in the example
[16:04:27] <xenaxon> ni idea why
[16:04:53] <doug65536> xenaxon:  Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined
[16:05:26] <xenaxon> refresh the page
[16:06:05] <doug65536> xenaxon: if the working example said to use .join('') then why have you removed it?
[16:06:20] <xenaxon> because it doesn't work at all if you add the join
[16:06:22] <xenaxon> it stops working
[16:06:25] <xenaxon> it breaks
[16:06:49] <doug65536> xenaxon: and you expect to make it work by passing unexpected stuff in template?
[16:07:03] <doug65536> "work" means, put links in autocomplete?
[16:07:18] <xenaxon> ?
[16:07:25] <doug65536> sorry, not links, specific paragraphs
[16:07:27] <xenaxon> no, works means, the dropdown being populated
[16:07:33] <xenaxon> yes
[16:07:39] <xenaxon> it should look like the example
[16:07:44] <xenaxon> http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
[16:07:46] <xenaxon> second example
[16:07:58] <doug65536> xenaxon: well it's a waste of time to have it not join those array elements
[16:08:18] <xenaxon> it doesn't work
[16:08:23] <xenaxon> here, i'll upload with the join
[16:08:25] <xenaxon> so you can see
[16:08:55] <xenaxon> ok, here it is: http://dithemes.com/test/
[16:08:59] <doug65536> xenaxon: The template used to render suggestions. Can be a string or a precompiled template. If not provided, suggestions will render as their value contained in a <p> element (i.e. <p>value</p>).
[16:09:11] <xenaxon> now it doesnt work at all
[16:09:39] <blindMoe> xenaxon: you have an empty join and you don't have Hogan loaded
[16:10:09] <xenaxon> well what is expected to be joined in?
[16:10:12] <blindMoe> http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/js/hogan-2.0.0.js
[16:10:13] <xenaxon> I've copied the exact example
[16:10:21] <blindMoe> you didn't include logan
[16:10:23] <blindMoe> err hogan
[16:10:41] <blindMoe> Hoganis what is doing the templating from what I can see
[16:10:50] <blindMoe> if it isn't loaded.. of course your templating won't look right
[16:11:04] <blindMoe> http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/
[16:11:25] <xenaxon> ahh, I was loading the wrong hogan
[16:12:01] <xenaxon> ok, then please explain
[16:12:05] <xenaxon> now it works.
[16:12:10] <xenaxon> but why is there an empty join?
[16:12:11] <blindMoe> already explained
[16:13:15] <blindMoe> xenaxon: that is just joining the elements of the template array I believe
[16:13:23] <blindMoe> http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/
[16:13:26] <blindMoe> read about hogan
[16:13:32] <blindMoe> and look at the last example
[16:14:28] <doug65536> xenaxon: that means put all the array elements together with nothing between them
[16:14:29] <nhulea_> halp !
[16:14:49] <doug65536> js> print(["a", "b", "c"].join(''))
[16:14:54] <blindMoe> xenaxon: I think they are doing that jsut to make the code look better.. it would be the same as this:
[16:14:55] <blindMoe> template: '<p class="repo-language">{{language}}</p><p class="repo-name">{{name}}</p><p class="repo-description">{{description}}</p>'
[16:14:57] <b-ot> doug65536: abc
[16:15:23] <xenaxon> well that's the exact code
[16:15:28] <blindMoe> no it isn't
[16:15:49] <xenaxon> thats the code in the template
[16:15:50] <blindMoe> you get it right?  It expects 'template' to be a string but they are building an array and using join() to turn the array into a string
[16:15:57] <blindMoe> xenaxon: look closer..
[16:15:58] <xenaxon> yeah, I get it
[16:16:03] <blindMoe> I am done.. back to my work ;)
[16:16:07] <xenaxon> :D
[16:16:09] <xenaxon> ok
[16:16:13] <xenaxon> thanks
[16:16:23] <xenaxon> :* both of you
[16:16:43] <doug65536> xenaxon: what is that json for? I don't see it get fetched in the network pane
[16:16:56] <xenaxon> which json
[16:17:02] <xenaxon> on jsfiddle?
[16:17:08] <doug65536> prefetch
[16:17:24] <xenaxon> the json contains the suggestion data
[16:27:21] <ernston> Whirl3d ?
[16:28:36] <Jinxed-_> I'm just starting out learning jquery and I have kind of a stupid question. I started a very simple site using jquery, it seems to work in code academy and as a jsfiddle, but when I saved my files locally and view them in chrome they don't work
[16:28:44] <Jinxed-_> do the files need to be hosted on a webserver to actually work
[16:28:55] <pixelpimp> no
[16:28:55] <Jinxed-_> or can I test them if they are stored locally
[16:29:10] <pixelpimp> probably missing a .ready() to wait for the script to load
[16:29:50] <pixelpimp> $(document).ready(function() { /* run your jQuery stuff here */ });
[16:29:50] <Jinxed-_> I dont' think so: http://jsfiddle.net/rG8gj/
[16:29:54] <ernston> can anyone help with my search form? http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/146/
[16:30:07] <Jinxed-_> like I said it works with jsfiddle just not locally
[16:30:08] <ernston> the slider is giving me unwanted results
[16:30:47] <Tomashe> if html is an object how do i run jquery find on it
[16:30:48] <Tomashe> html.find("#resultLand");
[16:30:51] <Tomashe> this isnt working :/
[16:32:16] <pixelpimp> Jinxed-_: nothing there stands out as to why it wouldn't work locally; is jQuery loading?  what basic debugging have you done?
[16:32:47] <sammych> okay, technical question time: say I have a global var, it's there because it comes from within a scope and I need it to be accessible to everyone. Thing is I want it to be read only, so I'm thinking I want to put it back into another closure that has an accessor method.
[16:33:18] <Jinxed-_> pixelpimp: I'm not sure how to debug jquery... all I have is a text editor (found aptana) and syntax highlighting. I
[16:33:21] <sammych> if that makes any sense
[16:33:32] <Jinxed-_> I just finished jquery on codeacademy and have 0 real experience
[16:33:40] <Jinxed-_> I was just going to start trying to expand what i was learning
[16:33:44] <Jinxed-_> for a fun project
[16:33:53] <pixelpimp> Jinxed-_: try altering something with jquery without relying on input
[16:34:01] <pixelpimp> also, learn to love the inspector in Chrome!
[16:34:36] <sammych> so, how would I go about getting that var into a closure. Should that closure be an IIFE that checks for that var, copies it, undefs the old ref?
[16:35:39] <Jinxed-_> Well the idea I had for my project was to build something that would help determine draft order based on weights. I was going to have it visually show simple ball divs based on the weights and then do the selection
[16:35:54] <Jinxed-_> I have the logic all finished (wrote a console program in c++ first) which does it all
[16:36:16] <pixelpimp> draft order?  i'll take a guinness
[16:36:16] <Jinxed-_> but it requires the ability to take input of names and weights
[16:36:30] <talntid> http://jeffquery.com/tanks/
[16:36:31] <Jinxed-_> like fantasy football draft order
[16:36:47] <Ernestoned> bloody thing is giving me 8 results
[16:36:50] <talntid> view src, tanks.js... anyone see anything I could do better?
[16:36:50] <pixelpimp> because people in #jquery totally play fantasy football ;)
[16:37:25] <Jinxed-_> well my work friends do, and I was hoping to have something visual instead of my borning C++ program
[16:37:41] <Ernestoned> anyone have experience with slider element?
[16:38:43] <pixelpimp> talntid: comments!
[16:39:09] <pixelpimp> drawImage() has some good documentation
[16:39:39] <talntid> I put comments in - I guess I could put in more
[16:41:26] <sammych> well, that idea works, it's totally async, but it works
[16:41:35] <sammych> thanks everyone for your input /s
[16:41:46] <sammych> ignore me, I'm being fake snarky
[16:41:56] <Ernestoned> if i type in:   abraxas
[16:41:58] <Jinxed-_> pixelpimp: it says I have an uncaught reference $ is not defined
[16:42:02] <Jinxed-_> either on line 1 or 2
[16:42:07] <Ernestoned> in the console it ays 8 results, rather than 2, any idea ?
[16:42:07] <pixelpimp> Jinxed-_: so jquery isn't loading
[16:42:08] <Jinxed-_> in my script.js file
[16:42:09] <Ernestoned> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/146/
[16:42:25] <Jinxed-_> pixelpimp: but in my references I see jquery
[16:42:27] <Jinxed-_> and click on it
[16:42:29] <Jinxed-_> and it seems all there
[16:42:49] <pixelpimp> references?
[16:43:02] <Jinxed-_> I'm using chrome developer tools
[16:43:18] <Jinxed-_> Under scripts I see: jquery-latest-min
[16:43:30] <Jinxed-_> jquery-latest.min.js
[16:43:36] <pixelpimp> in resources? hmm
[16:46:17] <Jinxed-_> pixelpimp: this is what I see: http://imgur.com/3zRIlGx
[16:48:15] <pixelpimp> move your jquery <script> up to load first
[16:48:54] <Ernestoned>             matches=$(list).find(':Contains(' + sterm + ')').parent();
[16:48:55] <Ernestoned> semi works, whislt using :contains  does not, any idea why?
[16:51:17] <Jinxed-_> pixelpimp: ahhhhhh I needed to switch and load jquery
[16:51:20] <Jinxed-_> before loading my script
[16:57:40] <benjings> does anyone know how I can add commas between 3 digits in a string?
[16:57:42] <benjings> http://jsfiddle.net/AkmG9/1/
[16:59:11] <pixelpimp> you mean to format it, or to arbitrarily place a comma somewhere there?
[16:59:46] <pixelpimp> because a != b; there are proper ways to format numbers, and there are proper ways to insert commas
[17:00:36] <benjings> pixelpimp my bad, format it
[17:03:55] <pixelpimp> there is a pretty good plugin called jQuery Number Format
[17:06:23] <Ernestoned> how can i re-write this:             matches=$(list).find(':Contains(' + sterm + ')').parent();
[17:13:41] <beancurd> benjings: http://jsfiddle.net/AkmG9/2/
[17:18:33] <benjings> beancurd oooo regex
[17:19:22] <beancurd> benjings: stole it from a comment here: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/comma-values-in-numbers/
[17:23:22] <benjings> beancurd hah, cool
[17:23:33] <benjings> I think I'll try to rewrite it without jquery next
[17:34:03] <chovy> is there a good explanation of jquery promises somewhere?
[17:34:20] <chovy> i'm so confused about .deferred, .when, .promise .resolve
[17:34:37] <chovy> i've already read the documentation.
[17:39:11] <chovy> is this thing on?
[17:39:35] * chovy inspects keyboard.
[17:41:07] <Jinxed-_> I have a variable in jquery and I want to have it create a div with that id... how would i do something like $(".list").append('<div id=toAddPlayer >' + toAddPlayer + " -- " + toAddWeight + '</div>');
[17:41:37] <yannickoo> Jinxed-_: where is the problem? :)
[17:41:52] <Jinxed-_> <div id=toAddPlayer
[17:41:55] <Jinxed-_> should it be
[17:41:59] <beancurd> ""
[17:42:15] <pixelpimp> needs quotes and you should exit the string to use the variable
[17:42:27] <pixelpimp> assuming it is a variable after all
[17:42:46] <yannickoo> .append("<div id=" + toAddPlayer + '">.....');
[17:43:45] <pixelpimp> needs a starting " for the id
[17:45:19] <Ernestoned> its the bloody slider the whole time
[17:49:21] <Jinxed-_> So I'm making good progress for my first project, but I have this weird issue where when I add a name my player weight keeps increasing: http://jsfiddle.net/sRWhy/
[17:49:32] <Jinxed-_> So say you have the name Jinxed with weight 3
[17:49:38] <Jinxed-_> it adds 3 balls correctly the first time
[17:49:42] <Jinxed-_> click it again and its 6
[17:49:43] <Jinxed-_> then 9
[17:49:44] <Jinxed-_> etc
[17:50:42] <TonnyNerd> I think it might sound like a flame war starter, but I was wondering
[17:50:53] <Technical_13> How can I simulate passing parameters in the URL with a jsfiddle?
[17:51:39] <TonnyNerd> I am working on a project, and ended up writing a lot more javascript than it had before to implement the customizations I needed
[17:52:18] <TonnyNerd> Since the original code used only jquery, I just kept using only it, but it got pretty messed up real quickly
[17:53:47] <TonnyNerd> So, my question: Which framework/library/thing can I use, that will cause the least impact (less changes, less reimplementation, etc) and yet will help me modularize my code better?
[17:58:33] <Jinxed-_> There is something wrong with this line: $('"#' + toAddPlayer + '"').append('<div class="ball"></div>');
[17:59:03] <pixelpimp> no need for those quotes
[17:59:29] <pixelpimp> you're not trying to recreate what you'd write in javascript, just the equivalent value
[17:59:52] <pixelpimp> so right now what you have would equate to $('"#whatever"')
[18:02:25] <Tomashe> hey guys i need some quick help here.. www.lasso.co.il , i the whole page work with push_state , so when u filter something it isnt refreshing the page. in additional i added infinite scrolling code i made.. now the issue is that when the infinite scrolling is aanitialize AFTER i use some push_state , it  just send me wrong values to and generate wrong results
[18:02:33] <Tomashe> anyone have any idea why that happenieng
[18:02:44] <Jinxed-_> pixelpimp: google says it goes to "#Bob"
[18:03:07] <Jinxed-_> when toAddPlayer= Bob
[18:03:21] <Jinxed-_> by google i mean chrome
[18:03:21] <pixelpimp> '"#Robert"'
[18:03:22] <Jinxed-_> debug
[18:03:33] <pixelpimp> still, you have those quotes in there
[18:03:57] <Jinxed-_> I get something like unrecongizned expression: "#Bob"
[18:05:13] <Jinxed-_> pixelpimp: so I'm confsued what yout hink it should be
[18:05:44] <Jinxed-_> instead of: $('"#"' + toAddPlayer + '"').append('<div class="ball"></div>'); I'm not sure which quotes you think should be axed
[18:06:06] <Jinxed-_> toAddPlayer is the variable I want to become the div id
[18:06:24] <Jinxed-_> that is appended to
[18:07:32] <pixelpimp> Jinxed-_: http://jsfiddle.net/NgNvG/
[18:07:38] <TonnyNerd> Jinxed-, I think this -> $("#" + toAddPlayer) is what pixelpimp is suggesting
[18:07:55] <pixelpimp> it is
[18:08:15] <pixelpimp> right now you are matching all of this, quotes included: "#Bob"
[18:09:49] <Tomashe> ok let me re-explain . i have a bounch of javascript code that on push_state i remove it and add it again.. but when i use that push state i always get that First time javascript.. i mean, on the code it change but in live its not
[18:09:54] <Tomashe> please help
[18:10:54] <Jinxed-_> so much easier
[18:11:02] <shoky> Tomashe: i didn't understand the issue yet
[18:11:45] <Tomashe> ok i will show u
[18:11:49] <Tomashe> go to lasso.co.il
[18:12:06] <Tomashe> scroll down.. u will see alert with '/'
[18:12:10] <Tomashe> now click on וילה
[18:12:14] <Tomashe> and scroll down
[18:12:22] <Tomashe> u will see the alert '/'
[18:12:27] <Tomashe> it should be that
[18:12:42] <Tomashe> if u look at the code using firebug u will see the alert should be /וילה
[18:13:03] <Tomashe> and that makes my infinite scroll get the wrong value :/
[18:14:03] <shoky> code says  alert("/");
[18:14:25] <Tomashe> did u clicked on the villa on the top filters?
[18:14:29] <shoky> ye
[18:14:36] <Tomashe> please check on firebug
[18:14:39] <Tomashe> u will see it changed
[18:14:43] <Tomashe> from the original one
[18:15:02] <shoky> im on chrome. loading new code doesn't overwrite old code..
[18:15:13] <shoky> not that i know how you're trying to load the new code
[18:15:40] <shoky> the initial page has  alert("/");
[18:16:09] <Tomashe> yes
[18:16:11] <Tomashe> thats what i saied
[18:16:27] <shoky> and why are you expecting it to somehow change?
[18:16:37] <Tomashe> the first page got that alert("/") but when i overwrite it on push state events it still not overwrite it
[18:16:50] <shoky> where are you overwriting it
[18:17:01] <Tomashe> just removing it from the code and put new javascript
[18:18:13] <Tomashe> on every push_state event that happening the entire content of that area including HTML and JAVSCRIPT is replaced in a new one
[18:18:47] <shoky> even if that would work, that's not how you should be doing it
[18:18:54] <Technical_13> So I'm trying to parse parameters from a URL and was wondering how to simulate that in a jsfiddle.
[18:19:46] <Tomashe> ok, what are your suggestions?
[18:20:10] <Technical_13> For example http://una.edu/student/~T13/page.html?foo=bar&submit=submit
[18:20:33] <shoky> Tomashe: you're already returning a JSON response and reading it with jquery. do whatever you need in that ajax callback, not by trying to replace some other code
[18:20:54] <Tomashe> i really want to replace that old one
[18:21:06] <shoky> bad
[18:21:17] <Tomashe> there is a way to reinitialize?
[18:21:21] <pixelpimp> add all of your elements the same way
[18:21:26] <shoky> what do you need to reinitialize
[18:21:52] <Tomashe> the entire javascript code of that window).scroll
[18:22:04] <shoky> ... no
[18:22:18] <shoky> that's what variables and data and such are for
[18:22:22] <Ernestoned> i believe the slider is the issue, can anyone clarify?
[18:22:25] <shoky> to represent stuff that change
[18:22:37] <Tomashe> yeah i know
[18:22:38] <shoky> not by replacing the whole chunk of code. that's for kids
[18:22:43] <Tomashe> i just thought i will do some short cuts
[18:22:43] <Tomashe> lol
[18:23:03] <Tomashe> ok thanks man
[18:23:12] <shoky> short cuts just end up biting you, as you can see
[18:25:05] <shoky> and it's not even a short cut in your case
[18:26:38] <Tomashe> it is
[18:26:52] <Tomashe> but i wont argue now
[18:36:25] <Whirl3d> Hey all. I got sidetracked and now I can't quite figure out this jqmobile issue:
[18:36:56] <Whirl3d> I want to add a feature to the listview similar to the search field
[18:37:14] <Whirl3d> but instead of text input, I want checkboxes
[18:37:45] <arschmitz> Whirl3d: thats actually possible in 1.4
[18:38:04] <Whirl3d> Where can I read more about it?
[18:38:59] <Whirl3d> I figured I would create a fieldgroup control that would have a data-groupname attribute and then inside the list items, I'd have spans with data-fieldname=same groupname
[18:39:11] <arschmitz> there is no official documentation about it on api site until 1.4 final comes out
[18:39:20] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/filterable/
[18:39:26] <arschmitz> that is the widget
[18:40:05] <arschmitz> you will need to use data-input attribute
[18:40:09] <Ernestoned> ive been playing with the code all night
[18:40:23] <arschmitz> to specify the checkbox
[18:40:25] <Ernestoned> come to the conclusion the slider is the devil
[18:40:38] <arschmitz> Ernestoned: the mobile one?
[18:40:46] <Ernestoned> yea
[18:40:50] <Ernestoned> Whirl3d has been helping me
[18:40:58] <arschmitz> Ernestoned: yes the performance is very poor
[18:41:04] <Ernestoned> damn it
[18:41:06] <arschmitz> we are replacing it hopefully in 1.5
[18:41:13] <Whirl3d> but I didn't know it was mobile unil way late.
[18:41:23] <Whirl3d> Ernstoned, it's much easier
[18:41:27] <Ernestoned> i have been trying to create an app with jquery mobile
[18:41:43] <Ernestoned> the slider was meant to be an easy to use form element on a mobile device
[18:42:05] <arschmitz> yes and it works well on most platforms
[18:42:11] <Ernestoned> when you type in: abraxas
[18:42:18] <arschmitz> but on older android and slower devices its not so good
[18:42:19] <Ernestoned> it says in the console, 8 results
[18:42:22] <Ernestoned> shouldnt it say 2 ? :S
[18:42:31] <Ernestoned> cant get it working on jsfiddle
[18:42:44] <Ernestoned> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/146/ is the latest i believe
[18:43:23] <Ernestoned> it shows data that should not be shown if you use the search input, then the slider
[18:43:31] <Ernestoned> eg, input: abraxas
[18:43:41] <Ernestoned> only 2 should show, and moving the slider shows new results :S
[18:44:24] <Ernestoned> Whirl3d the: 8 results has been confusing the shit out of me
[18:44:38] <Ernestoned> i have been trying to make it say 2, as that is what is meant to show only
[18:45:30] <Ernestoned> its like the input field + slider do not have a good friendship
[18:46:41] <Ernestoned> abraxas = 3 + 5 ratings,   choosing 1,2 or 4, causes new results to be found
[18:49:10] <Ernestoned> why could this be?
[18:49:22] <Whirl3d> ernston, you don't include the search input in your markup with listview, it's already setup to do it.
[18:49:47] <Ernestoned> data-role ?
[18:50:16] <Ernestoned> ok that buggered it
[18:53:20] <Ernestoned> i took that attribute off and the page would not load:s
[18:57:50] <Ernestoned> ok you lost me the only listview in the html is set on the <ul>
[18:57:56] <Ernestoned> removing that stops the page from loading
[19:02:27] <dtg> hi, i need to ask about jstree and renaming nodes
[19:02:47] <dtg> for some reason after i call jstree('rename', node) it creates a textbox but it is not in focus
[19:08:25] <Whirl3d> Ernestoned, give me just a little bit more time. I just got the control form built correctly (needs minor adjustments)
[19:08:51] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/154/
[19:09:32] <arschmitz> Whirl3d: Ernestoned: hope this helps http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/236/edit
[19:09:36] <Ernestoned> what is mirror controls
[19:09:41] <arschmitz> filter a list with a check box
[19:09:52] <arschmitz> you should be able to adapt for others as well
[19:10:26] <Ernestoned> i could get filters working just not together
[19:10:30] <Ernestoned> am new to jquery
[19:11:18] <Ernestoned> oh minor
[19:11:19] <Ernestoned> jesus
[19:17:07] <Whirl3d> arschmitz, thanks for the help. I am unable to add more than one filterable checkbox
[19:17:30] <Whirl3d> as soon as I add another checkbox, it breaks
[19:17:54] <Ernestoned> the service checkbox's on the prior examples
[19:18:01] <Ernestoned> worked
[19:18:09] <Ernestoned> am sure they did
[19:18:44] <Whirl3d> Ernestoned, look at the example arschmitz posted. NO JS involvled on your part. No knowlege of jquery necessary
[19:18:52] <Whirl3d> it's all determined by your markup
[19:19:07] <arschmitz> Whirl3d: just a sec
[19:19:22] <Ernestoned> even with 3 search types
[19:20:01] <Whirl3d> that's what I am working on with the gracious help of arschmitz
[19:23:19] <Ernestoned> on that example arschmitz
[19:23:27] <Ernestoned> data-input="#filterBasic-input:  relates to the id of the input field
[19:23:40] <Ernestoned> what if i have 2 inputs? i can only have 1 id
[19:24:24] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/237/edit
[19:24:31] <arschmitz> that works with multiple inputs
[19:24:40] <arschmitz> you can use a class selector instead of an id
[19:25:08] <Ernestoned> i wasnt sure where to point the data-input
[19:25:17] <Ernestoned> if it had to be 1 source or various
[19:25:18] <Whirl3d> doesn't work with two selected, btw
[19:25:53] <Ernestoned> shit
[19:25:57] <Ernestoned> ok ill stop there
[19:26:10] <Ernestoned> this isnt looking possible then
[19:26:24] <Jinxed-_> I don't think I'm approaching this correctly: playerNames.push(toAddPlayer.name=toAddPlayer, toAddPlayer.number=playerNames.length, toAddPlayer.color=playerNames.length%colors.length);
[19:26:34] <Ernestoned> the solution maybe to remove the slider
[19:27:30] <Rout> If someone can help me i have this -> http://pastebin.com/MdxGi0aG <- the first function of jquery don't work, some idea?
[19:28:12] <Ernestoned> Rout i thing if you get it in jsfiddle people can help easier
[19:28:17] <Ernestoned> thats what i am told
[19:29:37] <arschmitz> Ernestoned: Whirl3d: i need to get some work done so dont have time to play with this more right this second but i think my solution should give you a new place to start
[19:30:13] <Ernestoned> thx
[19:30:17] <arschmitz> it will need a little work to work with multiple input types ( just adjusting the if statement ) and to handle moth selected
[19:30:33] <arschmitz> for both selected you can adjust val to be an array
[19:30:44] <arschmitz> and change the default callback
[19:30:48] <arschmitz> to work with arrays
[19:31:13] <Ernestoned> i should of started learning js before jquery
[19:31:15] <Ernestoned> what a mistake
[19:31:40] <arschmitz> Ernestoned: very common these days actually
[19:31:50] <arschmitz> that people learn jquery to start
[19:32:18] <arschmitz> Whirl3d: Ernestoned: if you need any help feel free to ping me ill be around for another hour and a half or so just need to get back to work
[19:32:42] <Ernestoned> np
[19:32:46] <Ernestoned> thanx for the help
[19:32:55] <Ernestoned> jquery was meant to be the easy way in
[19:32:59] <bob-98274> Rout: Don't you want that "first function stuff" inside the document.ready?
[19:33:57] <arschmitz> no problem at all always happy to help with mobile issues and see exactly how people are using the library helps when making changes to the library to know the things people are trying to use it for
[19:34:00] <Jinxed-_> Can someone explain to me why I can't make an object like this:         var t_Person = {         	name: toAddPlayer,         	color: (playerNames.length+1)%colors.length),         	number:(playerNames.length+1)         };         play
[19:35:13] <arschmitz> Ernestoned: and actually in your case i had never considdered using multiple inputs with filter at same time
[19:35:27] <bob-98274> Jinxed-: unmatched parens?
[19:35:28] <arschmitz> swaping for things like checkboxes sure but not multiple
[19:35:56] <Ernestoned> i had to over complicate things
[19:35:58] <Ernestoned> :(
[19:38:27] <Jinxed-_> bob-98274: haha opps
[19:41:12] <Rout>   $('#CostumerAddForm').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.post('add', $(this).serialize(), function() {              $('#inline1').html(' <h3> Cliente Salvo </h3>');  // THAT happens but, didnt save anything...          }); });
[19:41:18] <Rout> any idea?
[19:48:20] <bob-98274> Rout: sort of depends on what http://.../add does on your server?
[19:49:14] <Rout> i'm using a cakeframe work, /add its a action,
[19:49:48] <Rout> but for some reason, the submit of the second form, is sending data to url of the first form
[19:50:20] <doug65536> Rout: do you have duplicate ids?
[19:51:51] <doug65536> Rout: anyway, bug is probably in server side code
[19:53:14] <bob-98274> Rout: you could take a look at what's coming back - change function() to function(data,status,xhr) and examine status and xhr for errors, etc.
[19:54:32] <Rout> i dont have duplicate ids ! i changed it now, and for some reason, continues
[19:56:06] <bob-98274> well, that one was easy...
[19:56:22] <Ernestoned> any success Whirl3d ?
[20:05:27] <Rout>  where this code request is going? 	$('#CostumerAddForm').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.post('add', $('#CostumerAddForm').serialize(), function() {  			$('#inline1').html(<?php echo "'".$this->Html->image('test-pass-icon.png').' <h3> Cliente Salvo </h3>\''?>);  		 }); });
[20:06:26] <duckgoose> Rout impossible to tell from that code
[20:06:47] <duckgoose> you need to take the data in #CostumerAddForm, serialize it, then print it
[20:06:52] <duckgoose> that will be where it's going
[20:07:33] <duckgoose> at least I think so :0
[20:07:53] <duckgoose> hmm maybe it just serializes the form
[20:08:02] <duckgoose> in which case the <form> tag will tell you
[20:08:04] <Rout> duckgoose: i make this work
[20:08:13] <emurillo510> $.post('add', $('#CostumerAddForm'
[20:08:18] <Rout> but, the request, is going to wrong way,
[20:08:18] <emurillo510> does it go to /add url?
[20:08:27] <Rout> yes.
[20:08:35] <duckgoose> bah
[20:08:42] <duckgoose> I read the code wrong :<
[20:08:44] <Rout> is going to localhost/control/sales/add.
[20:08:46] <Rout> but
[20:09:02] <Whirl3d> Okay. I have been working on this too long. I can't remember how to get the value of a radio button field when there are 4 buttons....how do I get the selected radio element
[20:09:03] <Rout> if i put $.post('costumers/add', ....
[20:10:33] <Tamborine> hey guys. Hope all are well... I"m having an issue with beforeunload not working: my code is as follows $(window).on('beforeunload unload', function() { //other code here }); It works in firefox and ie but not chrome... I am aware that chrome uses beforeunload instead of unload.. i have also tried 'pagehide' with no success. What am i missing?
[20:11:24] <Ernestoned> let me check
[20:12:23] <Ernestoned> $('input[name=radioName]:checked').val()
[20:21:25] <Rout> How via Jquery i can check if the element is onfocus?if($(this).onfocus()){}
[20:21:25] <Rout> ?
[20:22:56] <Rout> i want to now, if some object is not on focusing.
[20:27:00] <Rout> http://pastebin.com/maJSs6aE <-  someone help me, i want if the object is not more on focus, hide the updateDiv
[20:29:00] <Whirl3d> what does jquery mobile do to the "not valid" elements when filtered.
[20:29:14] <Whirl3d> it must ad a "hidden' class or something
[20:31:04] <Ernestoned> yeah
[20:31:12] <Ernestoned> style="display;none"
[20:31:20] <Ernestoned> i found that in the markup output
[20:33:15] <Ernestoned> <li  ...................  style="display: none; >
[20:33:22] <Ernestoned> at the end of the opening <li> tag
[20:39:00] <Ernestoned> has that helped?
[20:43:19] <Jinxed-_> is this the correct way to compare strings
[20:43:20] <Jinxed-_> if ( thePlayerBalls[i].name == thePlayerBalls[x].name)
[20:46:36] <dcrouch> Greetings everyone.  I'm looking to post to a login form.  I have the following code.  http://fpaste.org/33943/43138137/   I keep getitng a 302 response.  Not sure what's going on.  Can anyone provide assistance?  I changed the URL, user, and pass for posting to fpaste.org.
[20:54:01] <Whirl3d> ernstoned, you are just gonna have to pay someone to do it for you. I have spent way too much time trying to compensate for the crazy way that jqmobile uses data-attributes to auto-style shit. No thank you.
[20:54:16] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TnDha/154/
[20:54:24] <Whirl3d> Thats as close as I am gonna get
[20:54:35] <Whirl3d> I think you need to refresh the stupid listview somehow
[20:54:41] <Whirl3d> so frustrating.
[20:54:45] <Whirl3d> I'm going to the bars.
[20:54:52] <Ernestoned> bars ?
[20:54:53] <Ernestoned> lol
[20:54:56] <Ernestoned> more than one?
[20:55:12] <Ernestoned> thanx for the help Whirl3d
[20:55:22] <Ernestoned> i owe you a drink
[20:55:24] <Ernestoned> or a doobie
[21:03:14] <Jinxed-_> if you splice does it resize your array
[21:03:32] <Jinxed-_> ie if I have an array  foo = [a,b,c,d];
[21:03:52] <Jinxed-_> and I foo.splice(1,1);
[21:03:55] <Jinxed-_> should get rid of b
[21:04:06] <Jinxed-_> making [a,c,d];?
[21:50:11] <Roots47> Does anyone know if its possible to change jcarousel "visible" item count on the fly?
[21:56:49] <Jinxed-_> woot finished my first jquery webpage
[21:56:53] <Jinxed-_> well rev 1
[21:59:17] <dcrouch> Greetings everyone.  I'm looking to post to a login form.  I have the following code.  http://fpaste.org/33943/43138137/   I keep getitng a 302 response.  Not sure what's going on.  Can anyone provide assistance?  I changed the URL, user, and pass for posting to fpaste.org.
[21:59:36] <dcrouch> Congrats Jinxed-_
[22:02:12] <doug65536> dcrouch: 302 is a redirect
[22:03:32] <dcrouch> Yes, it's redirecting the page request after login.  I'm assuming I'm doing something wrong as it always says 302 unless I manually login.
[22:04:02] <doug65536> dcrouch: look in your debugger. what address does it try to redirect you to?
[22:04:09] <Cork> dcrouch: what are you using to log in?
[22:04:12] <Cork> ajax?
[22:04:19] <Cork> oh right it's down there...
[22:04:43] <Cork> dcrouch: where are you seeing the 302? the console?
[22:04:51] <Cork> js should never get 302 visible
[22:05:16] <dcrouch> The django service is returning a 302 when I click submit on the form.
[22:05:34] <Cork> dcrouch: i meant in the browser where do you see that you get 302?
[22:10:44] <Roots47> how do you readd a plugin to an element?
[22:10:46] <dcrouch> Cork, The page at https://mnxsupport1351997810.zendesk.com/agent/?zat=true#/tickets/40820 displayed insecure content from http://dev-support.mnxsolutions.com/accounts/login/?next=/time_tracking/login/.
[22:11:13] <Cork> Roots47: normally you need to clean up if it did any modifications, and then you will have to add it again
[22:11:32] <dcrouch> Cork, django: [22/Aug/2013 05:10:27] "POST /time_tracking/login/ HTTP/1.0" 302 0
[22:11:49] <Cork> ok so the console
[22:11:56] <EditThat> hey all, i'm using jquery autocomplete and defining _renderItem on a data attribute of my autocomplete field, but from what i can tell i should be using _renderItemData instead with the latest version of jquery-ui - when i use _renderItemData it's ignored, though
[22:11:57] <Roots47> Ugh, feels like a hack.  There has to be some way to modify the number of items visible on the fly in jcarousellite, anyone ever use this?
[22:12:40] <EditThat> when i use _renderItem instead, i get item.value as undefined in my focus() and select() functions
[22:13:44] <Cork> dcrouch: check what location: in the header says when you get redirected
[22:16:40] <Cork> EditThat: what indicated that you should use _renderItemData ?
[22:17:25] <EditThat> Cork: i read an stack overflow answer that mentioned it
[22:17:31] <EditThat> however, cancel my question. i'm a retard
[22:17:32] <Cork> EditThat: 1.10 still works fine with _renderItem for me
[22:17:46] <EditThat> was somehow managing to use an old version of jquery-ui again, renderItem works fine
[22:17:54] <Cork> EditThat: look at jqueryui's documentation not random comments in forums -_-'
[22:18:04] <EditThat> Cork: lol i was, but i had the version mixed up
[22:18:10] <EditThat> it's cool, thanks anyway
[22:18:11] <Cork> EditThat: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[22:19:23] <dcrouch> Cork I'm quite new to jquery and web development and not quite sure what I'm looking at I see all 200 and a 304.  A few posts but mostly get.  Am I supposed to be looking at developer tools?
[22:19:44] <Cork> dcrouch: yes
[22:19:47] <dcrouch> The 302 was just in the server's log.
[22:20:02] <Cork> dcrouch: well the server logs might show where they redirects to
[22:20:26] <dcrouch> I posted in this chat where it redirects to.
[22:21:07] <dcrouch> the ?next= is the redirect.
[22:21:19] <Cork> ok
[22:21:46] <Cork> dcrouch: and you have verified that you actually send the email and password the way the server expects it?
[22:22:31] <dcrouch> same variable names and I can print them via python on the server-side, yes.   :)
[22:22:50] <dcrouch> Past that I don't know.
[22:23:16] <Cork> dcrouch: and what part about this problem is in js?
[22:23:35] <Cork> if you don't expect the redirect it sounds like a server problem
[22:24:24] <dcrouch> I expect the redirect.  I'm wondering if within js I have to handle a response  to the redirect.
[22:24:33] <Cork> no
[22:24:58] <Cork> the browser will stip the redirect and handle it before it even calls the success handle
[22:25:04] <Cork> so you can't handle it in js
[22:26:05] <dcrouch> Okay I'm doing something wrong.   Perhaps sleep is right.  Thank you.
[22:26:05] <Cork> so you get ajax > login > redirect > browser detects the redirect > browser loads the new url > server sends response > browser triggers success
[22:28:59] <EditThat> one more autocomplete question; i pass an array of objects into source() with a value and a label, and i have an input being populated with the label field on select and on focus
[22:29:54] <EditThat> when i type the whole "value" into my autocomplete input, i don't get any options to choose from because it thinks i already know what i'm after - how can i get my second input to be populated with label if i can't select anything from the suggestion list?
[22:30:15] <EditThat> ie, neither focus() or select() are called
[22:31:06] <EditThat> ah, change()?
[22:31:21] <Cork> EditThat: are you actively hiding the dropdown if it matches exactly or something?
[22:31:48] <Cork> EditThat: that isn't default behavior (and would actually break a site of mine so you made me a bit worried for a min :D )
[22:32:50] <EditThat> Cork: i'm not actively hiding it, but it does disappear
[22:32:53] <EditThat> hmm
[22:33:15] <EditThat> all i have defined is minLength, delay, focus and select
[22:33:44] <EditThat> but it does search both value and label, right? so maybe it's saying well i can't find it in label so it can't be in my list-- display nothing
[22:33:46] <Cork> EditThat: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[22:33:53] <Cork> try typing an exact match
[22:34:38] <EditThat> yeah but that source doesn't have value and label
[22:34:59] <EditThat> and hte custom data one has a value the same as the label
[22:35:24] <Cork> ya, i tested on my site and it works there
[22:35:25] <EditThat> if you type the value in the custom data one, it doesn't appear
[22:35:34] <EditThat> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data --> sizzlejs
[22:35:37] <Cork> though it uses remote source
[22:35:43] <EditThat> that's in data, but the label is "Sizzle JS"
[22:35:49] <EditThat> in value i mean
[22:36:06] <Cork> EditThat: it search label not value
[22:36:29] <EditThat> Cork: riiiiight
[22:36:32] <EditThat> Cork: can you make it search both?
[22:36:39] <EditThat> Cork: or just value?
[22:36:58] <Cork> EditThat: combine them into value for the search
[22:37:06] <Cork> uh, sorry
[22:37:09] <EditThat> you mean into label
[22:37:12] <Cork> i meant combine them into label
[22:37:14] <Cork> ya
[22:37:17] <EditThat> hmm
[22:37:28] <Cork> as you customize the rendering you can use a third column name for it
[22:37:45] <Cork> that's how i normally solve it
[22:38:37] <EditThat> alright, cheers
[22:39:39] <Cork> EditThat: normally value is meant to not be of concern for the user, it is the internal representation for the option
[22:39:48] <Cork> EditThat: just like <option value="">
[22:40:57] <EditThat> Cork: i see
[22:41:11] <EditThat> Cork: i'm using value as a "code" and label as a "name"
[22:41:23] <EditThat> so the user types a code and gets a name populated
[22:41:36] <Cork> ah
[22:41:51] <Cork> you should just give it those names instead name and code
[22:42:44] <EditThat> Cork: then how would it know which one to use for autocomplete
[22:42:58] <Cork> EditThat: what do you mean?
[22:43:12] <EditThat> doesn't it look for label and specificall use that?
[22:43:19] <Cork> { code: "something", name: "something else" }
[22:43:21] <EditThat> like if i renamed label to name, how would it know that name was the one it shoudl use
[22:44:16] <Cork> $.map(list, function(v) { v.label = v.code + ' ' + v.name return v; })
[22:44:22] <Cork> opps
[22:44:26] <Cork> * $.map(list, function(v) { v.label = v.code + ' ' + v.name; return v; })
[22:45:07] <EditThat> yeah i'm using underscore's map already
[22:45:14] <EditThat> and i map value -> code
[22:45:22] <EditThat> etc
[22:45:57] <EditThat> actually, i just added a "description" field to my map, and added just name without code
[22:46:01] <EditThat> seems to be working ok
[22:46:03] <EditThat> thanks for yoru help
[22:47:09] <Cork> EditThat: actually scratch that
[22:47:16] <Cork> EditThat: you don't need to use label at all
[22:47:36] <Cork> EditThat: autocomplete will search every other key except value
[22:47:44] <EditThat> right, but it needs a value to work?
[22:48:01] <EditThat> so i should have value, code and name
[22:48:09] <EditThat> where value = code,
[22:50:01] <EditThat> boom, works a charm
[22:50:11] <Cork> EditThat: that's one option
[22:50:36] <EditThat> do i even need a value?
[22:50:41] <Cork> EditThat: or you can just set value = ui.item.value = ui.item.code in the select callback
[22:50:56] <Cork> EditThat: if you want the input to be populated with something
[22:51:11] <EditThat> yeah i've done that
[22:51:13] <Cork> EditThat: but you can set it manually in select if you like
[22:51:28] <EditThat> oh, sorry i don't set it in select, i just use it
[22:51:41] <EditThat> only place it's set is when i pass it into source
[22:51:41] <Cork> heh had to dig around in my code to find this code ^^
[22:51:53] <EditThat> appreciate your help
[22:51:57] <Cork> np
[22:52:12] <Cork> EditThat: well i set two input fields from the autocomplete
[22:52:23] <Cork> so i do that in the select callback
[22:52:51] <EditThat> cool
[22:59:15] <Reeslo_> Hi
[23:01:08] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/M9RtS/4/ <— hi guys, can someone help me with this please…. making checboxes act like radio button..
[23:11:03] <EditThat> Reeslo_: http://jsfiddle.net/m5EuS/1/
[23:11:59] <EditThat> Reeslo_: or this one's probably better http://jsfiddle.net/44Zfv/
[23:13:34] <xec_> why not just use radio buttons?
[23:13:47] <xec_> also, axscode, those were probably for you
[23:14:27] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/M9RtS/6/
[23:15:22] <EditThat> o
[23:15:27] <axscode> thanks.
[23:15:42] <tonph> How to detect which element clicked amongts the various submit button on a single form ..
[23:15:53] <xec_> axscode: the .each() call is redundant
[23:16:09] <tonph> i used this.find('button[type="submit"]:focus')
[23:16:16] <axscode> ic
[23:16:22] <tonph> but this is not working in chrome :(
[23:16:30] <EditThat> tonph: where are you trying to find out from?
[23:16:34] <EditThat> usually you can use $(this)
[23:16:37] <axscode> can you edit my jsfiddle xec_ im not sure how will it looks like
[23:16:47] <tonph> i m trying to find from a button
[23:17:01] <EditThat> so you click the button, and you want to find out what button you clicked?
[23:17:18] <xec_> axscode: http://jsfiddle.net/M9RtS/7/
[23:17:21] <tonph> yes, ths are the submit button for my single form
[23:17:42] <EditThat> right, so how have you linked a click event to your submit buttons
[23:17:44] <tonph> and i want to detect which button triggered the submit..
[23:17:56] <xec_> axscode: but honestly, you know there is a type="radio", right?
[23:18:28] <tonph> i have bound the form submit to a function, and the button does the submit
[23:18:46] <axscode> xec_ yes yes, thanks for this, i would really love to use radio but i cannot touch the php that generates it
[23:18:56] <xec_> i see
[23:19:03] <EditThat> tonph: ok, maybe you're better off binding a submit event to each button
[23:19:12] <EditThat> then you can use $(this)
[23:19:59] <tonph> i tried that $this.find('button[type="submit"]:focus')
[23:20:20] <tonph> it works on the firefox and IE , but when i check chrome - it is not able to detect that..
[23:20:27] <EditThat> no, so instead of binding an event to the form submit, you bind a submit event to the button clicks
[23:21:06] <tonph> that also - i want to handle as form submit as i am trying to retreive the action attr so so ... :(
[23:21:24] <EditThat> yes, you can do both
[23:21:33] <tonph> just i was thinking if i can mend this :focus to some cross browser stuff
[23:21:37] <EditThat> so you click the button -> it submits the form -> triggers your form submit event
[23:21:39] <tonph> then it ll fix my prob
[23:21:45] <tonph> yes
[23:22:26] <tonph> and the button has data-information='1234', which i use to retreive so as i can send this valu in the ajax
[23:23:43] <xec_> tonph: what are you really trying to do?
[23:24:15] <tonph> its like a table in that each row has a button, whch submits the form.
[23:24:55] <tonph> each submit button has some value associated, which takes the data-information in the button to the backen
[23:25:01] <tonph> and updates that info ....
[23:25:21] <tonph> xec_ : :)
[23:25:54] <xec_> could you do $('[type="submit"]').click(function(){ /* look for $(this).data("information") */ })
[23:28:06] <tonph> xec_ : I have the code structured as binding with .on, so i just have bound with submit
[23:28:34] <tonph> xec_ : so just wondering if i get a cross browser alternative to :focus , then i can use that
[23:29:21] <xec_> :focus should work on chrome, but isn't it just a lot easier to do .on("click", fn) instead of .on("submit", fn)
[23:29:22] <lemonsparrow> How do I get the content of a webpage that loads HTML into an iFrame using Javascript?
[23:29:35] <xec_> so you can easily know which button was clicked
[23:29:51] <Cork> lemonsparrow: per document
[23:30:15] <xec_> re-reading the messages, looks like this is exactly what EditThat suggested too
[23:30:54] <axscode> hi guys how to make the string glows just using jquery without any other plugin
[23:31:05] <tonph> xec_ : yes thats right ... but any way if i can handle this with submit, as i require it as form submit so as i can validate it at the backend as form.
[23:31:11] <Cork> axscode: css3 text-shadow
[23:31:38] <Cork> axscode: i expect you mean text in the page when you say string
[23:32:28] <axscode> $("#someElement").fadeIn(100).fadeOut(100).fadeIn(100).fadeOut(100); <— something like this, but looks ugly right
[23:33:04] <xec_> tonph: ah, i assumed you were doing ajax post. so if you're just letting the submit through, why look for the focused button?
[23:33:06] <lemonsparrow> Cork: The URL remains the same, yet content gets added to the page when you click links on it.
[23:33:11] <Cork> axscode: so you want to make it blink not glow?
[23:33:22] <axscode> ah blink
[23:33:45] <axscode> but blink is like without animation right
[23:34:05] <axscode> like tweening style, anyways, yeah even blink will do
[23:34:35] <xec_> just animate the opacity?
[23:34:41] <_rose> hi, i am working with phonegap ios app.In my application i require user's intagram photos.With just the username how can i get access token via json (not appended to redirect uri, since i am using it in ios app).I am not sure how to achieve this.please help me?
[23:35:27] <tonph> xec_ : the button has an attr data-information, which is sent along with the form submit
[23:35:47] <xec_> tonph: how is that sent?
[23:35:50] <axscode> yeah that would do, whats the best approach of infinite glowing/fading as long as element exist
[23:35:58] <tonph> xec_ : i require this data-information value from the button which clicked it.
[23:36:04] <xec_> axscode: css3 animation, tbh
[23:36:15] <axscode> tbh  is?
[23:36:19] <xec_> to be honest
[23:36:19] <axscode> to be honest
[23:36:22] <axscode> ah
[23:36:23] <xec_> :)
[23:36:26] <axscode> :p
[23:36:38] <Krisostoomus> hi anyone knows how to get countries printed on http://private-carsale.co m/worldmap/index.html .... it's taken from http://bl.ocks.org/dwtkns/4686432 ?
[23:36:49] <tonph> xec_ : i am sending as an ajax call , as a dictionary object... which is validated at the backend with wtform..
[23:36:58] <Cork> axscode: ya, css3 is definitely the way to go, some older browser won't support it, but that shouldn't matter
[23:37:15] <xec_> tonph: ok, so why don't you just use .click()
[23:37:17] <axscode> yeah so how to fade and glow in css3?
[23:37:26] <xec_> tonph: you can still prevent normal submit in a separate handler
[23:37:33] <Cork> ?g mdn @keyframes
[23:37:33] <b-ot> keyframes: @keyframes - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes
[23:37:38] <Cork> axscode: ^
[23:37:45] <axscode> ah really
[23:38:51] <axscode> hmmmm
[23:40:04] <Cork> @keyframes glow { from { text-shadow: none; } to { text-shadow: 0 0 5px yellow; } }
[23:40:10] <xec_> hehe
[23:40:12] <Cork> something like that (untested) should work
[23:40:27] <xec_> i think he means fade/in out rather than a glowing shadow
[23:40:50] <Cork> s/text-shadow: .*/opacity: / then
[23:41:29] <tonph> xec_ : let me try other way round and come back :}
[23:41:51] <xec_> and you'd need to go back before restarting, so @keyframes glow { 0% { opacity: 1; } 50% { opacity: .5; } 100% { opacity: 1; } }
[23:41:58] <xec_> maaaybe
[23:41:59] <xec_> :D
[23:42:06] <Cork> xec_: no you don't
[23:42:14] <Cork> xec_: you can interleave the animation
[23:43:09] <_pingu> how can i get the x position of a horizontal scrollbar in a table and later automatic scroll to this position ?
[23:43:14] <Cork> animation glow 1s linear 0s infinite alternate;
[23:43:20] <Cork> * animation: glow 1s linear 0s infinite alternate;
[23:44:23] <Cork> _pingu: var oldScrollTop = offsetParent.prop('scrollTop'); offsetParent.prop('scrollTop', oldScrollTop);
[23:44:30] <faraway> Krisostoomus: what do you mean how to get the countries ?
[23:44:41] <Krisostoomus> Can anyone reccommend some 3d world map with countries javascript or something else?
[23:45:20] <Cork> Krinkle|detached: look at svg rather then js
[23:45:29] <Cork> that would prob give you a better match
[23:45:32] <faraway> Krisostoomus: you could look at http://kartograph.org/
[23:45:46] <Cork> opps *Krisostoomus
[23:46:13] <xec_> axscode: Cork is right, of course http://jsfiddle.net/gjsC5/
[23:46:16] <Krisostoomus> its not what i need
[23:46:17] <xec_> oh, he left :(
[23:46:21] <Krisostoomus> i need some pre made stuff
[23:47:26] <aagii> hi guys
[23:47:27] <_pingu> Cork: I get: .prop is not a function
[23:47:45] <Cork> _pingu: are you running it on a jquery object?
[23:47:48] <aagii> how to load hmtl content instead of iframe
[23:47:50] <axscode> wahh
[23:48:00] <aagii> $('side_info_div1').load('http://news.gogo.mn/horoscope/today/eastHoroscope.html'); is not working
[23:48:16] <Cork> _pingu:  offsetParent was meant to be a jquery selection of the element that scrolls
[23:48:25] <xec_> aagii: why is it named "div" if it's an iframe?
[23:48:32] <Cork> lol
[23:48:41] <aagii> ?
[23:48:46] <Cork> also that's a strange name of an element
[23:48:50] <Cork> <side_info_div1>
[23:48:55] <xec_> :D
[23:49:10] <aagii> that's class name
[23:49:17] <Cork> aagii: add a dot there then
[23:49:22] <xec_> aagii: and whatever happened to <iframe src="http://url.goes.here"></iframe>
[23:49:28] <aagii> yes
[23:49:53] <aagii> using iframe, can't get content in iframe
[23:49:53] <Cork> aagii: and ya, if it's for an iframe you want .attr('src') not load
[23:50:09] <Cork> aagii: is the target for the iframe the same domain as your?
[23:50:10] <_pingu> Cork: I dont understand. tried: $('table').offsetParent.prop('scrollTop')
[23:50:17] <axscode> guys sorry, how can i use that glow again?first time to encounter keyframe- http://jsfiddle.net/M9RtS/10/
[23:50:42] <Cork> _pingu: if you have <div id="parent" style="overflow: scroll"><table></table></div>
[23:50:48] <aagii> not same
[23:50:55] <Cork> _pingu: offsetParent in my code would be $('#parent')
[23:51:14] <Cork> _pingu: alternatively you can find offsetParent() from the table
[23:51:26] <Cork> ?api offsetParent
[23:51:26] <b-ot> Cork: .offsetParent(): Get the closest ancestor element that is positioned. http://api.jquery.com/offsetParent/
[23:51:46] <aagii> error on firebug:  ReferenceError: $ is not defined [Break On This Error] 	  $.fn.isSearchLink = function (A) {

[23:54:03] <axscode> exactly i need....
[23:54:08] <axscode> what i need*
[23:54:14] <_pingu> Cork: ok, understood, but for .prop('scrollTop') I get that it is not a function.
[23:54:38] <axscode> really nice, this is the first time encounter keyframes…. lovert
[23:54:57] <Cork> _pingu: is it complaining of prop or scrollTop ?
[23:55:21] <Cork> _pingu: btw what version of jquery?
[23:57:06] <aagii> still not working
[23:57:26] <_pingu> Cork: 1.7.2   it says: $('table').offsetParent.prop('scrollTop') is not a function. the autocompletion shows offsetParent, but no .prop
[23:58:07] <aagii> Cork: can you see it http://jsfiddle.net/gjsC5/2/
[23:58:32] <Cork> ?api offsetParent

[23:59:04] <Cork> sorry
[23:59:06] <Cork> wrong nick
[23:59:09] <Cork> _pingu: ^
[23:59:25] <Cork> aagii: you can't load from third party domains
[23:59:39] <aagii> is it impossible?
[23:59:41] <Cork> aagii: you can load it in an iframe, but you won't be able to access the content
[23:59:48] <Cork> aagii: only if you proxy it over your own server
