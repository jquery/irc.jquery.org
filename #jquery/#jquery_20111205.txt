[00:01:14] <enerel> some plugin csss which where working in 1.4.2 are not work with jquery 1.7.1 any idea?
[00:01:48] <enerel> guys?
[00:01:52] <enerel> anyone home?
[00:02:17] <Xotix> some missing css() functionallity? or 1.7.1 introduced new css classes? check the change logs
[00:02:59] <crab> is there a simple way to find the largest height of a collection of elements?
[00:04:12] <Xotix> .height?
[00:08:59] <noob44> i need help. i started learning jquery and javascript today in order to fix some bugs in tumblr that i'm pretty sure the tumblr staff will never get around to fixing themselves. i'm finding the syntax confusing, though. what characters do i ues to lead a contains selector into a long sequence of mostly javascript based code? sorry if i phrased this incorrectly, it's all new to me...
[00:10:06] <noob44> to clarify, i'm wondering what to put after $("p:contains(The URL you requested could not be found.)")
[00:10:23] <crab> xotix: that returns the first height.
[00:10:43] <noob44> or will that only modify that paragraph?
[00:13:18] <megatrond> noob44: ';'
[00:14:00] <noob44> megatrond: thanks! and when i want to end the section?
[00:14:32] <noob44> can i do something like ;{ //code here } ?
[00:15:11] <megatrond> and you should write: $.('p:contains(The URL you requested could not be found.)')
[00:15:19] <megatrond> well, a method
[00:15:35] <megatrond> $.('p:contains(The URL you requested could not be found.)').method();
[00:15:52] <megatrond> the first part will select all p tags that contain the text
[00:15:59] <megatrond> and method() will do something with it
[00:16:08] <Cork> i would strongly recomend to use a class instead
[00:16:34] <Cork> :contains looks through the text content on each p element on the page, its really slow
[00:17:14] <megatrond> Cork: alt, look for the text in a spcific div
[00:17:21] <Cork> no
[00:17:29] <Cork> :contains should almost never be used
[00:17:46] <Cork> its a preformance killer
[00:17:57] <noob44> alright, i'll look into alternatives
[00:18:08] <Trudko> Guys selector >>$("input[id^='sar_4a_check_last_name_unknown_1").size(); returns 0  but $("#sar_4a_check_last_name_unknown_1").size(); returns 1. I am looking for checkbox
[00:18:18] <Trudko> what I am missing
[00:18:21] <Cork> noob44: just add a class like 'class="url-not-fond"'
[00:18:34] <Cork> then do $('p.url-not-found')
[00:18:44] <enerel> some plugin csss which where working in 1.4.2 are not work with jquery 1.7.1 any idea?
[00:18:45] <noob44> i wish i could, but there's no way to actually alter tumblr's 404 page
[00:18:59] <noob44> i'm not even sure if i can find out what class it's using for the text there
[00:19:24] <Cork> noob44: just load the 404 page and inspect it with a dom inspector
[00:30:28] <noob44> i guess the title class will have to do
[00:35:40] <noob44> so what are my alternatives to p:contains if 'Not Found' exists with the class title?
[00:36:23] <noob44> ooh, i've also got <meta name="description" content="Not Found - The URL you requested could not be found." />
[00:36:52] <Trudko> Guys selector >>$("input[id^='sar_4a_check_last_name_unknown_1").size(); returns 0  but $("#sar_4a_check_last_name_unknown_1").size(); returns 1. I am looking for checkbox
[00:36:55] <Trudko> what I am missing
[00:36:56] <Cork> noob44: what are you trying to do?
[00:37:53] <Cork> Trudko: try removing the ^
[00:38:24] <noob44> Cork: when tumblr's tags contain spaces, they link to urls where the spaces are replaced with hyphens. these pages don't actually exist, though; the actual url has underscores. thus on encountering one of tumblr's built in 404 pages i'm hoping to get it to run: var pathname = window.location.pathname;  if (pathname.indexOf('-') == -1) {   window.location.replace("http://sergiocornaga.tumblr.com/");     } else {   window.location.replac
[00:38:28] <ximarin> hi all, I have a problem using a json-array: The json-data looks like this: [{"binFull":"F2","amount":"2"},{"binFull":"F3","amount":"2"}]. how do i access the data now?
[00:39:10] <Cork> noob44: are you loading the page though ajax or?
[00:39:30] <Trudko> Cork:  did not work, ^ should be ok it says that id start with no?
[00:39:31] <JesperA> hmm isnt there a oposit version of .parent?
[00:39:52] <Cork> Trudko: yes, was only a test
[00:40:10] <noob44> Cork: don't think so, don't even know what the alternative answer to that question would be
[00:40:12] <Cork> ?.find @ JesperA
[00:40:13] <bot-t> JesperA, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[00:40:28] <JesperA> yeah i tested that but it doesnt work for some reason :S
[00:40:59] <Cork> JesperA, Trudko: see ?p
[00:40:59] <bot-t> JesperA, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:41:11] <Cork> heh bot failed :)
[00:43:06] <Trudko> Cork ?
[00:43:17] <Trudko> Cork are u suggesting to use find?
[00:43:23] <Cork> a working example that shows the problem
[00:43:38] <Cork> .find should work, so i need to see your code to tell why it doesn't work
[00:43:46] <Cork> or rather i need to see your markup
[00:45:30] <Trudko> btw is input[id^='sar_4a_check_first_name_unknown faster then $("#) ?
[00:46:05] <Cork> no, much much MUCH slower
[00:46:22] <Trudko> ok then I use $("#) :)
[00:46:23] <Cork> # is about as fast as it can get to find an element
[00:46:26] <Trudko> problem solved :D
[00:46:52] <Cork> input[id will find all inputs on the page, then loop over them looking at the id attribute
[00:47:04] <Cork> # just looks in the id reference object
[00:47:19] <Trudko> ok I actually find this in code I am woriking on and did not see point of that.
[00:49:15] <noob44> is there a way to make contains more effecient? can i search meta tags with it?
[00:59:30] <noob44> hmm... is it possible to do something like meta[name=description]:contains ?
[01:00:45] <shal3r> noob13, .attr('contains')
[01:00:57] <shal3r> noob44 ^
[01:02:05] <Cork> noob44: yes it is
[01:02:15] <Cork> and no :contains isn't an attribute
[01:02:59] <Cork> noob44: $(document.head).find(meta[name="description]) should work
[01:03:04] <Cork> *noob44: $(document.head).find(meta[name="description"]) should work
[01:03:19] <noob44> Cork: excellent, will try it
[01:03:24] <Cork> gah... + the missing '' around it :)
[01:03:56] <noob44> Cork: I thought they were optional?
[01:04:09] <Cork> i meant .find('meta[name="description"]')
[01:04:12] <Cork> those arn't :)
[01:04:21] <noob44> ah i see now
[01:06:06] <yamahaalex37> does anyone know a cool show-off effect like webGL, but compatibly with more browsers?
[01:08:50] <zeppo> hey dudes
[01:08:56] <zeppo> i have a question
[01:09:33] <zeppo> i want to animate a box to expand from bottom up
[01:09:42] <zeppo> but im not sure how to go about expanding something upwards
[01:09:59] <Cork> zeppo: position absolute?
[01:10:47] <zeppo> hmm
[01:12:02] <Cork> zeppo: alternativly you need to do i with margin-top
[01:12:07] <Cork> (+height)
[01:13:02] <zeppo> yeah thats a good approach
[01:13:07] <zeppo> i'll try that out
[01:16:20] <dbugger> Hey guys. I want to make a map that, given a file (maybe XML, maybe JSON, doesnt really matter), it draws a map of my country with posibility of selecting the states with cities on that file. Do you guys know a plugin I could use for that?
[01:18:48] <noob44> bleh, i can't get anything to work any more
[01:19:32] <yamahaalex37> can i know if this compatible with ie8?
[01:20:11] <Cork> yamahaalex37: please don't dubble post, pick one channel and ask there
[01:22:38] <yamahaalex37> cork, different ppl
[01:22:43] <yamahaalex37> different opinions, answers etc
[01:22:51] <yamahaalex37> not hurting everyone

[01:29:31] <kaulian> Hi all
[01:30:03] <Ortund> How can i define an array with 2 elements per array item? Like array(1, item1) would be 1 item
[01:30:07] <kaulian> I have a problem (probably very simple)
[01:30:32] <kaulian> I create a little code to move a img on the load of my page
[01:31:01] <bobdobbs> kaulian: possibly animate(). Maybe queue()
[01:31:06] <kaulian> I want to know how can I stop this img after the first move

[01:33:22] <kaulian> bobdobbs: my code is available here http://pastebin.com/wkkhWnX6
[01:33:41] <plediii> is there a way to download a javascript file without executing it?
[01:34:31] <bobdobbs> plediii: Yeah. It will only be executed by the page calling it.
[01:34:44] <plediii> so I could display the script with something like $.get(url, function (js) { $("body").text(js) })
[01:34:50] <kaulian> i fact that's works but then I launch a picture gallery height of window change  so my img element
[01:34:58] <Cork> plediii: the server would have to set a special mime type
[01:35:26] <plediii> Cork: there's no way to tell jquery to ignore the mimetype?
[01:35:42] <Cork> plediii: its not jquery you need to tell
[01:35:55] <Ortund> What's wrong with this line: $(".result").html("<p>RNG: " + rng + "</p>");
[01:36:08] <Cork> plediii: but ya, if its through ajax, you can grab it as text
[01:36:49] <plediii> Cork: how do I do that?
[01:36:54] <Cork> just set datatype: 'text'
[01:37:20] <plediii> Cork: ah, ok thank you
[01:37:25] <Cork> np
[01:40:06] <Ortund> Can anyone tell me why this doesn't write anything to the div >>> http://jsfiddle.net/U4JaT/
[01:40:57] <Cork> Ortund: cause your using mootools?
[01:41:07] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/U4JaT/1/         << that's closer to what I want
[01:41:25] <Ortund> Cork, I'm not using mootools on my site though, and it still doesn't write anything to the page there
[01:41:39] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/U4JaT/2/
[01:42:09] <Ortund> meh ok, got it, thanks Cork
[01:42:14] <Cork> :D
[01:42:43] <Ortund> Cork, now I need a bit of help putting the idea into action...
[01:43:17] <Cork> i'm not even sure what your trying to do
[01:43:48] <Ortund> the client wants random images displayed on the page. I inted to build an array with 2 "columns" per image and then randomly generate a number. The image whose "Id column" matches the number generated will be displayed on the page ... I've got no idea how to build the array though
[01:44:46] <Cork> Ortund: just curius... why don't you just do this on the server before you send the page?
[01:45:07] <Cork> feels kinda sad to depend on js for that
[01:45:53] <Ortund> I'm using asp.NET so I would have to replace current img tags with asp:Image tags to make the accessible to the server code
[01:46:11] <Cork> ugg...
[01:46:21] * Cork hats .net -_-'
[01:46:37] <Ortund> lol
[01:46:47] <Ortund> I'd use PHP, but don't have the software here
[01:47:05] <Cork> just the fact they make it so hard to use that developers opt for broken pages is... *sigh*
[01:47:10] <Ortund> thank god I use PHP for my personal projects at home
[01:48:02] <Cork> Ortund: btw you would have to remove the img tags anyway
[01:48:12] <Cork> cause else each page would load two images
[01:48:23] <Cork> one that loads when the pages loads
[01:48:27] <Cork> and then the random image
[01:48:29] <Ortund> Well I was just thinking of changing the values of their src attributes
[01:48:39] <Cork> exactly
[01:48:58] <Cork> most of the time that won't be until after the image is loaded
[01:50:19] <beasty> morning all
[01:50:22] <beasty> i'm pondering
[01:50:25] <beasty> i have a form
[01:50:33] <beasty> with help links at each label
[01:50:47] <beasty> so when i tab it's get to the help image instead of the next input
[01:50:50] <beasty> anyway to fix it ?
[01:52:34] <Cagelin> hi guys, can anyone tell me how to do a mouseover properly on a <td> which has child elements? I'm trying to let an 'edit button' fade in when you hover over the td, but whenever I hover over the child elements inside the td, the fadein/out effect is spazzing out :/
[01:53:51] <MrBenn> Are you using mouseover? try using mousein
[01:54:02] <MrBenn> uh or mouseenter
[01:54:03] <megatrond> Cagelin: mouseover is passed on to children - but mouseenter doesn't
[01:54:10] <MrBenn> ^
[01:54:15] <megatrond> bah
[01:54:20] <megatrond> as i was typing :)
[01:54:28] <noob44> i'm afraid i'm reverting to plain ol' javascript! thanks for your help though, everyone
[01:54:30] <megatrond> mouseenter and mouseleave
[01:55:30] <yamahaalex37> how do i see the ppl taht liked this
[01:55:30] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/item/1-content-rotate
[01:55:31] <Cagelin> ah, thanks. I'll try :)
[01:56:30] <megatrond> beasty: use tabindex on all the inputs
[01:56:47] <Cagelin> hmm.. now this doesn't work :$(this).children(".k_edit_button").stop().fadeIn(150);
[01:57:50] <kaulian> bobdobbs: I found a solution
[01:57:56] <kaulian> bobdobbs: thanks for attention
[01:58:16] <MrBenn> Cagelinm, check that 'this' is the right element
[01:58:47] <MrBenn> Cagelin*
[01:59:58] <Cagelin> ah I got it. Seems like this was the proper way to do it: $(".k_edit_button", this).stop().fadeIn(150);
[02:00:07] <Cagelin> it works now :) thanks for the tips ^^
[02:00:40] <Cork> Cagelin: or .find
[02:00:50] <Cork> Cagelin: .children only looks in direct children
[02:00:58] <Cork> not grandchildren
[02:01:15] <Cagelin> Ahh, that explains why it didn't work. Thanks Cork :)
[02:04:25] <beasty> megatrond: thanks
[02:22:30] <VictorCL> does live events shoudnt never go inside the document.ready ???

[02:41:35] <Daiben> hello all
[02:41:45] <Daiben> is there something in jquery like form.reset()?
[02:42:00] <Daiben> the docs doesnt help me this time
[02:42:43] <ravenzz> isn't reset() ok?
[02:43:11] <Daiben> $("#updateForm").reset();
[02:43:12] <Daiben> ?
[02:43:21] <Eviltwin> $("form").each(function(){this.reset()});
[02:43:50] <Eviltwin> Or $("#updateForm").each(...
[02:43:51] <ravenzz> uhm why each form?
[02:43:58] <Eviltwin> Or $("#updateForm")[0].reset();
[02:44:08] <ravenzz> why [0] ?
[02:44:19] <Eviltwin> I just used "form" as my generic selector for possibly more than one form
[02:44:36] <ravenzz> k
[02:44:47] <Eviltwin> ravenzz: Because AFAIK reset is not in jQuery.fn
[02:46:06] <Daiben> $("#updateForm").each(function(){this.reset()});
[02:46:07] <Daiben> no succes
[02:48:20] <Eviltwin> $("<input type=reset/>").appendTo("#updateForm").click().remove(); ?
[02:49:09] <ravenzz> mh
[02:49:20] <Eviltwin> Last resort
[02:49:22] <megatrond> why doesnt $('#form').reset() work?
[02:49:25] <ravenzz> the reset type should work without any js
[02:49:35] <ravenzz> try it yourself http://jsfiddle.net/C3jtr/
[02:50:01] <Eviltwin> Well yeah
[02:50:10] <Eviltwin> Presumably he's trying to reset it under some other circumstance or something
[02:50:23] <ravenzz> oh yep it could be possible
[02:50:25] <Eviltwin> Otherwise he's just silly
[02:52:34] <megatrond> document.getElementById('theform').reset(); works
[02:52:49] <megatrond> http://jsfiddle.net/C3jtr/1/
[02:53:21] <Eviltwin> So does this: http://jsfiddle.net/C3jtr/2/
[02:53:36] <Eviltwin> As does this: http://jsfiddle.net/C3jtr/3/
[02:54:25] <Eviltwin> Daiben: Does your form contain any elements with an ID of "reset" or a name of "reset"?
[02:54:34] <Eviltwin> Daiben: That'll screw you over
[02:54:37] <Eviltwin> Change them
[02:54:45] <Daiben> no
[02:54:47] <ravenzz> IDs must be unique
[02:54:59] <Eviltwin> No one said otherwise...
[02:55:07] <Daiben> the form is loaded by ajax
[02:55:09] <ravenzz> so i would exclude the each() solution
[02:55:14] <Daiben> problem?
[02:55:15] <ravenzz> the [0] is pretty fine
[02:55:51] <Eviltwin> ravenzz: That was for this: http://jsfiddle.net/C3jtr/4/
[02:55:56] <ravenzz> Daiben use on() instead of click() then
[02:56:51] <ravenzz> or bind that click event within the success callback of your ajax request
[02:56:51] <Daiben> ok
[02:57:06] <ravenzz> (after you append the form to the dom)
[02:57:16] <ravenzz> Eviltwin yea ;)
[02:57:34] <Eviltwin> Daiben: Why/when are you trying to make jQuery reset the form?
[02:57:57] <ravenzz> Daiben anyway it would be good to use the form reset button instead of external (to the form) ones
[02:58:15] <ravenzz> you would place them somewhere else in the page by css
[03:22:58] <neo_> hello guys
[03:23:25] <neo_> I'm trying this https://gist.github.com/1433282
[03:23:47] <neo_> the problem is that the overlays doesn't show, I think it's because #slideshow was created with jquery
[03:23:53] <neo_> how can I select that element?
[03:27:58] <neo_> hello?
[03:28:01] <neo_> anybody here?
[03:28:10] <dr0id> no
[03:28:40] <richardjprice> are there issues with using jquery-mobile and jquery ui in the same page?
[03:29:18] <neo_> please, some ideas with that? https://gist.github.com/1433282 How can I select #slideshow (which was created using jquery) ?
[03:32:19] <ravenzz> neo_ what do you thing about of doing this <a href="foo.png"><img src="foo.png" alt="foo"></a>
[03:32:27] <VictorCL> how can I set the a variable value that I have floating outside my functions?
[03:32:49] <ravenzz> and than use any lightbox or similar plugin
[03:33:03] <neo_> ravenzz, the problem is that I need to call this     $('#slideshow').overlay({ mask: '#000' });
[03:33:08] <neo_> but jquery ignores me
[03:33:20] <neo_> because #slideshow was created dinamically
[03:33:32] <ravenzz> I don't know how this overlay works
[03:33:33] <neo_> #slideshow is hidden  (display: none)
[03:33:48] <neo_> .overlay( just show it
[03:37:19] <Altreus> Can anyone think of a situation in which the callback in $.post will not be called even if the request returns 200 OK?
[03:37:40] <Altreus> oh never mind
[03:37:47] <Altreus> invalid JSON because I left a print in

[03:57:49] <ravenzz> if you want to check agains the checked attribute you should check if the $(this).attr('checked') is != "undefined" and "checked"
[03:58:18] <ravenzz> but the .is(':checked') way is better
[03:58:35] <ravenzz> aganst*
[03:59:00] <ravenzz> typo fail compilation
[03:59:22] <ravenzz> i have to go bye
[04:06:28] <Ukto> anyone good with jquery-ui? I am having a hard time with some strange conflict with a modal. What sort of conflict could cause $('#dialog').dialog('open'); to stop working from within a $('#sometable tr').click(function(){  ?
[04:06:57] <Ukto> but it works anyother place. it will load immediatly etc, just not from within the click
[04:07:03] <Ukto> other functions perform
[04:09:30] <IvanKuzev> ouch...havent banged my head in this one yet. but it kind of works from click function on my site
[04:15:11] <ldexterldesign> sup guys
[04:18:12] <ldexterldesign> Excuse my naivety here, but is there etiquette to hot-linking off @github?
[04:23:27] <jmaister> Hi! I'm having a jCanvas problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8383875/cannot-add-layer-to-canvas-using-jcanvas
[04:23:55] <jmaister> So some methods are working on my <canvas> elements, other doesn not. Any help would be appreciated
[04:28:14] <ldexterldesign> is this the best way of including an external js file in a script? http://tobiasz123.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/include-script-inclusion-jquery-plugin/
[04:28:25] <ldexterldesign> similar to php include();
[04:31:17] <quicksilver> jmaister: only possibility which occurs to me is you are using an old version of jCanvas which doesn't have addLayer
[04:36:40] <edgardo> I doing some own placeholder form testing: http://jsfiddle.net/L8Wb7/ <-- works great when you click inside it and then outside, but as soon as you type something, remove it and click outside the placeholder won't come back
[04:36:44] <edgardo> any ideas why? :)
[04:37:24] <jmaister> quicksilver: You are absolutely right o.O. I was using 4.0.1, not 5.0. I have no idea why. I'll try that
[04:37:43] <jmaister> good thinking btw. +1 internets for you, sir
[04:40:35] <quicksilver> jmaister: why thank you. I shall cash them in immediately for a picture of a cat with a caption underneath.
[04:41:06] <zingbats> Heya. I'm using the autocomplete UI element, and I notice the search event is only before the remote AJAX call. Is there hack way to bind to the event equiv. to AJAX success?
[04:45:43] <_thumper_> Hey, how do I get the number of days between two DatePickers?
[04:46:27] <JesperA> Ok, stupid question time: There isnt a preventDefault function that makes the browser download every image with a special class first and THEN download the rest in the dom?
[04:47:34] <Zogot> Ahoy all
[04:48:39] <edgardo> ahoy matey
[04:50:39] <_thumper_> I need to calculate a value dynamically on qtip show. How would I do that?
[04:51:12] <daslicht> hello friends, i have just started with jQuery and javascript, at the moment i use firebug to debug is this the proper way?
[04:51:36] <JesperA> sure
[04:52:21] <daslicht> ok cool :) I currently on to craete a site for a music label , I have decided to use jPlayer as player
[04:52:27] <daslicht> its working somehow :
[04:52:28] <daslicht> http://www.ansolas.com/kiss/Music.php
[04:52:41] <daslicht> but try to press stop:)
[04:52:52] <daslicht> how do i debug such kind of things ?
[05:04:01] <Double_Rainbow> hello, will this work? var totalExtras = $.get("tarif_offre.php", {'theme' : $(this).val()});
[05:04:27] <Double_Rainbow> tariff_offre.php is supposed to return a string
[05:05:26] <Cork> Double_Rainbow: no $.get/.post/ajax is async
[05:05:50] <Cork> it has a callback you should use
[05:06:49] <Cork> Double_Rainbow: $.get("tarif_offre.php", {'theme' : $(this).val()}, function(totalExtras){ /* do what you need to do with the data */ });
[05:07:53] <Double_Rainbow> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh
[05:08:17] <_thumper_> QTip text is rendered on first tooltip show, how do I set it to render each time it shows?
[05:15:58] <jaffipaffi> I have a radio button with an onclick="confirmChange();". confirmChange should have a confirm dialog. But if the user presses cancel in the dialog, it should not make the clicked radio checked. I have tried return false, but that doesn't work
[05:16:52] <Cork> jaffipaffi: try onchange instead
[05:18:21] <ravenzz> and avoid inline scripts
[05:18:35] <Cork> defenitly
[05:18:39] <jaffipaffi> Cork: Okay
[05:18:40] <JesperA> Ok, stupid question time: There isnt a preventDefault function that makes the browser download every image with a special class first and THEN download the rest in the dom?
[05:18:41] <jaffipaffi> Thanks
[05:19:01] <_thumper_> Ok another problem... Would a disabled TextBox fire any events? Such as click or mouseover?
[05:19:07] <Cork> JesperA: no, you would need to use a preloading script
[05:19:26] <JesperA> Cork thats the opposite of what i want :P
[05:19:30] <Cork> _thumper_: not sure, but i think its no
[05:19:55] <Cork> JesperA: image tags is loaded when they are found in the dom
[05:20:07] <Cork> the user can disable it, but not the website
[05:21:16] <ravenzz> JesperA anyway if you give us more details about what are you trying to do, maybe we can suggest you a solution
[05:21:52] <Cork> JesperA: it was you who tried to do an image randomizer right?
[05:22:02] <JesperA> Cork nope
[05:22:16] <Cork> damn, mixed you up with someone else then :P
[05:24:10] <JesperA> ravenzz, well, i have a page with product images, title, description and stuff, when i click the title, the product item expands and show all productimages, i already have "$(".item_expanded").find('.lazy').renameAttr('data-original', 'src', true );", so the product images isnt loaded before i click the title
[05:24:48] <JesperA> BUT, the first product image doesnt obey that rule, so i would like to load the thumbnails first and then the first image in the expanded view to make the page seem to load faster
[05:25:34] <Cork> JesperA: best solution is prob to try to keep the full images in something like json
[05:25:45] <Cork> then only have the thumbnails in the page
[05:26:20] <Cork> then you can use the thumbnail src or another attribute to find the full image
[05:26:28] <ravenzz> or just show the 1st one and a bunch  of links to the others
[05:26:44] <JesperA> yeah but the reason the first image doesnt use that function is that i want the first image they would see when they click the title to show directly without waiting for it to load
[05:27:07] <ravenzz> so load any 1st image
[05:27:15] <ravenzz> at the begin
[05:27:32] <ravenzz> +ning
[05:27:58] <JesperA> that is what i do now, but i still would want the thumbnail loading first so the user doesnt have to wait for the thumbnails because the first image in every item must load too
[05:28:23] <ravenzz> ok what is wrong with that?
[05:28:23] <Cork> JesperA: you can always preload the thumbnail so it loads as early as posible
[05:28:44] <Cork> if i understand your question correctly that is
[05:29:21] <JesperA> Cork well, its hard to predict since we have over 4000 items and when searching for products there isnt any good way of preloading the result
[05:29:34] <Cork> ah
[05:29:46] <JesperA> ravenzz the page seem to load slower since they have to wait for images that they dont see to load first
[05:29:54] <Cork> the only way i can think of then is dom position hackery
[05:30:11] <JesperA> yeah maybe
[05:30:12] <James13433> Whats going wrong here? .... eval("productImg" + color); I get error message "productImg" isnt defined, its not ment to be :/
[05:30:12] <Cork> make sure the thumbnail is positioned before the main in the dom, then it should be loaded first
[05:30:32] <Cork> James13433: you mean except the fact your using eval?
[05:30:46] <ravenzz> I told you
[05:30:52] <JesperA> yeah Cork i will test that and see how it end up
[05:30:58] <ravenzz> wait i'll make a fiddle
[05:31:17] <James13433> Well i thought Cork, that say if the color variable was red.
[05:31:34] <James13433> then that would return, the variable productImgRed ? no
[05:31:36] <ravenzz> JesperA, Cork I don't like that solution, because it would be semantically incorrect
[05:31:57] <Cork> James13433: is the variable in global scope?
[05:32:30] <Cork> ravenzz: moving things around in the dom doesn't have to mean you change the sematic of the page
[05:33:08] <James13433> yes Cork..
[05:34:15] <JesperA> ravenzz well, it would still look the same ;)
[05:34:22] <Cork> James13433: window["productImg" + color]
[05:34:29] <JesperA> So would only be annoying for source lookers :P
[05:37:38] <James13433> Now I get "uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: ." Cork. seemed to get rid of the other erro though
[05:38:00] <Cork> ?p @ James13433
[05:38:01] <bot-t> James13433, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:40:40] <newbye> hallo
[05:41:25] <newbye> can anyone please help me with a "small" issue?
[05:41:38] <Cork> ?ask @ newbye
[05:41:38] <bot-t> newbye, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:41:48] <JesperA> sure newbye, just ask the question here
[05:42:38] <newbye> how do i reffer to an object in a duv: $('#sugestiicf._here_').click(function() {
[05:42:53] <newbye> where sugestiicf is a div
[05:43:15] <newbye> and _here_ should be some link id
[05:43:15] <Cork> newbye: space to separate parent and child
[05:43:31] <Cork> and if you have an id of the child, you don't need the parent
[05:43:38] <Cork> id's are uniq
[05:45:55] <ravenzz> JesperA something like that http://jsfiddle.net/vM9vS/
[05:46:27] <newbye> cork it doesn't seem to work :(
[05:46:50] <Cork> $('#_here_') ?
[05:47:27] <Cork> newbye: an id can only exist once on the page, if you have it multible times it will overide eachother
[05:48:11] <newbye> the whole construction is like yhis: <div id="sugestiicf"><a id="opener" name="opener" href="#">Link</a></div>
[05:48:29] <Cork> $('#opener') then
[05:48:43] <ravenzz> JesperA so the dom will render fast because there are no images there, just links
[05:48:54] <newbye> $('#opener').click(function() {...} doesn't work
[05:49:21] <Cork> newbye: if you search through your generated html for id="opener" how many hits do you get?
[05:49:48] <JesperA> ravenzz yeah, looks good, but doesnt work in my environment, the whole point of an expanding product item is to show everything without have to go into links ;)
[05:49:50] <newbye> only one, ajax-generated
[05:49:57] <Cork> ah!
[05:50:06] <newbye> if I put the link in body and not into a div it works
[05:50:10] <Cork> newbye: you prob assign it before it lands in the dom
[05:50:18] <Cork> try .live see ?.live
[05:50:18] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[05:50:27] <Zogot> $('#sugestiicf').on('click', '#opener', function(e){ // code here }
[05:50:29] <ravenzz> JesperA "// and so on" means load the thumbnails too :P
[05:50:32] <Zogot> newbye &
[05:50:35] <Zogot> newbiy ^
[05:51:01] <ravenzz> then bind a click function to each one so it will load the big one every time a user click on it
[05:51:56] <newbye> @zogot: nope it didn't :(
[05:52:22] <Cork> newbye: your adding #sugestiicf through ajax too?
[05:52:30] <newbye> ...yep
[05:52:33] <ravenzz> where load should means (set the innerHTML of each link to the img the A is linking)
[05:52:41] <Zogot> ok, whats the element your not adding with ajax :p
[05:52:51] <JesperA> Hmm yeah ravenzz that might actually work, i will give it a try, thanks
[05:52:52] <newbye> nononononon, sorry
[05:52:53] <Zogot> put that in my line where the #sugestiicf is :)
[05:52:58] <ravenzz> yw
[05:53:29] <newbye> the sugestiicf div ia static
[05:54:11] <Zogot> .on should work then.  You tried just putting an alert in the function to check its being attached?
[05:55:23] <jayflux> is there a good alternative to flot? it seems to be an inactive project
[05:56:13] <SugaSlide> jPlot
[05:57:21] <Cork> raphael.js is quite nice too
[05:59:17] <Nomikos> To animate say, a background color, I need the UI library, right? Anyone know which /part/ of it takes care of the colour stuff?
[05:59:42] <jayflux> raphael.js looks more complex Cork  am i right in thinking that
[06:00:22] <Cork> ?g g.raphael.js
[06:00:23] <bot-t> Cork, gRaphaël—Charting JavaScript Library - http://g.raphaeljs.com/
[06:00:55] <Cork> jayflux: its basic lib is, but he also built a charting lib ontop of it
[06:01:00] <SugaSlide> http://raphaeljs.com/analytics.html <-- looks sexy
[06:01:27] <jayflux> yeah it is
[06:01:48] <Cork> the basic lib is a compatibility layer for vml<>svg
[06:01:58] <Cork> realy sweet if you ask me :)
[06:02:23] <JesperA> Nomikos it depends on what you want to animate? Just animate a background change, no problem without UI
[06:04:32] <Nomikos> JesperA: hmm.. are you sure? if I don't include the ui thing it refuses to animate colours. width/height are fine ofcourse
[06:05:22] <Nomikos> JesperA: also, my "problem" is now solved, I did something wrong, still not sure what, but it works now
[06:08:03] <jayflux> anyone here skilled with raphael charts?
[06:11:32] <rethus> what is the (document).ready() function if i have no jquery? document.onload?
[06:12:03] <ravenzz> JesperA http://jsfiddle.net/vM9vS/1/ :P
[06:14:11] <JesperA> nice raven but: http://cl.ly/3Q1r0l1J3t1U0H1h1m2u
[06:14:26] <newbye> @zogot: $('#sugestiicf').on('click', '#opener', function(e){ alert('') });       sais ErreurÂ : $("#sugestiicf").on is not a function
[06:15:03] <JesperA> ravenzz seems like they are loaded when the DOM loads the first time, would be awesome if they didnt :P
[06:15:06] <ravenzz> you should edit it so it will load the thumbs within the click event handler
[06:15:15] <ravenzz> yep!
[06:15:29] <Ungy> I am having a problem with position() I am dynamically adding an element on the form but when I attempt to get it's position I get nothing
[06:16:01] <JesperA> ravenzz oh yeah, you used the original sized version as the thumbnails? that is an easy fix then
[06:16:24] <ravenzz> mh no no
[06:16:28] <Ungy> Is there any way to get position of a dynamically added element
[06:16:31] <ravenzz> that is just a proof of concept
[06:16:51] <ravenzz> you shouldn't use the orginal size ones
[06:17:09] <ravenzz> or you should, dunno that is your choice
[06:17:24] <JesperA> yeah i got that, so the original wouldnt be loaded if i used real thumbnails, right?
[06:17:34] <ravenzz> yep
[06:18:09] <JesperA> awesome, haha nice that you spent all this time on my problem, thanks :P
[06:19:16] <ravenzz> eh it is not still done, but it was already in my mind so I just wrote that np
[06:21:25] <daslicht> is there an event invoked once the <audio> element is ready so that i can get the duration ?
[06:21:33] <daslicht> onreadystatechange did not to teh job
[06:21:49] <ravenzz> use the html5 apis?
[06:21:51] <ravenzz> js
[06:22:13] <daslicht> yeah but there is no such event
[06:22:25] <daslicht> http://www.quackit.com/html_5/tags/html_5_event_handler_content_attributes.cfm
[06:22:27] <ravenzz> load?
[06:22:34] <daslicht> thats why i am askeing here
[06:22:36] <daslicht> nope
[06:22:38] <daslicht> not working
[06:22:46] <ravenzz> http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#the-ready-states
[06:22:53] <ravenzz> google :p
[06:23:06] <daslicht> onready state change is not working
[06:23:18] <daslicht> since it is dispatched before duration is set :)
[06:23:21] <Ungy> Is there any way to get position of a dynamically added element
[06:24:48] <daslicht> loadedmetadata that shoudl do teh kob
[06:24:50] <daslicht> i try
[06:25:03] <daslicht> should do the job
[06:25:14] <ravenzz> yep
[06:25:26] <ravenzz> i read that right now
[06:26:03] <daslicht> thanks
[06:26:17] <ravenzz> yw
[06:34:11] <jeffsmykil> is .dialog all you need to invoke the dialog stylings on a dialog?
[06:34:27] <jeffsmykil> the dialog box you  are oppening doesn't need any special classes?
[06:39:13] <nitzer> hi! im through an $.each loop , and I want to appendTo the result while the each is still looping, but i only get the appendTo display something at the end of the $.each loop .. this is the way it works? or is something wrong?
[06:39:14] <daslicht> i have created a jQueryUI slider something like : $('#slider').slider({...
[06:39:32] <daslicht> and i have stored its reference like this: slider = $('#slider').get(0);
[06:39:58] <daslicht> now i like to change its value , i tried it like this: slider.value = myValue
[06:40:07] <daslicht> but that did non seem to have an effect ?
[06:40:10] <daslicht> what am i missing
[06:41:46] <darkangel> I'm a bit dumb when it comes to JS ... how do I store a value in an "instance variable" when creating a widget with the widget factory?
[06:43:28] <IvanKuzev> how to view the type<tag> of the element the jquery object is refering to
[06:44:14] <jeffsmykil> #jqueryui
[06:44:25] <jeffsmykil> oops
[06:44:55] <quicksilver> IvanKuzev: $(obj)[0].tagName
[06:45:17] <quicksilver> jQuery objects are just special arrays. You can get at the underlying DOM objects
[06:46:37] <jeffsmykil> in that they aren't objects in any other language
[06:48:01] <darkangel> ajpiano: Thanks for your great widget tutorial. Could you maybe help me with my question?
[06:52:41] <hacafrakus> is anyone here on #php?
[06:54:33] <k1ng> hacafrakus yea
[06:54:42] <Taggnostr> if I'm adding elements via jquery, do you think it's better to style them with .css() to keep the css with the js or keep the css in the .css file?
[06:54:44] <hacafrakus> k1ng: its invite only, how do i get there
[06:54:47] <Vaerros> I'm doing element.slideUp() and in the callback I'm removing the element -- the problem is some code after the .slideUp() is executed before the callback fires
[06:55:02] <k1ng> register your nick?
[06:55:11] <hacafrakus> ah, thank you
[06:55:22] <Vaerros> Taggnostr: avoid inline styling except the very specific cases where it might make sense
[06:55:41] <Taggnostr> .css() seems cleaner, but I'm creating a few elements with $(html_here) and then I have to use .find() to get to the elements I want before being able to style them, and that feels a bit clumsy
[06:57:02] <Vaerros> basically, is there way to have an animation method to finish completely and then have what follows execute only after it's done?
[06:58:26] <Taggnostr> Vaerros, this is my function with .css(): http://dpaste.com/666457/
[06:58:41] <VictorCL> can I use a selector to find a element that has a    <a data-qid='18'    ></a>     like I want to find the one that have data-qid = 18
[06:59:37] <sanjayb> VictorCL: $('a[data-qid=18]')
[06:59:39] <VictorCL> $("a [data-qid='18'])
[06:59:49] <VictorCL> ok I was gonna ask for that :)
[07:01:30] <Vaerros> Taggnostr: that doesn't make sense
[07:01:43] <Vaerros> put that stuff in a stylesheet
[07:02:03] <numist> assuming I've called $.ajax(foo.com/page2) from foo.com/page1 and I want to insert <script> elements that are unique to the second page into the current page, how can I determine uniqueness?
[07:02:19] <dr0id> need google analytics like date range selector, is there any such jquery plugin ?
[07:03:08] <Taggnostr> Vaerros, that has 2 problems though: 1) if I copy the js somewhere else I'll have to find and copy the css too; 2) the css rules are parsed even when js is not used (both because it's disabled and because the script might be removed at some point)
[07:05:51] <fotoflo> hi all. quick question. I'm looking at the jQuery documentation and there are a bunch of :selectors how do i use them with variables?
[07:06:08] <Vaerros> 1) I dunno what you mean by 'find and copy'
[07:06:36] <fotoflo> for example: $( ".receptacle" ).droppable({activate: function(){appendDropStops(this)},
[07:07:00] <Vaerros> 2) if you're worried about adhering to some principle, the principle of keeping your js clean and not using inline styling is more relevant
[07:07:08] <fotoflo> appendDropStops(element){    }
[07:07:20] <fotoflo> how do i get the :nth-child of the element?
[07:07:31] <iman> does any body know how can discern String from number in jq?
[07:09:37] <numist> ah hah, $(scripts[0]).html() == $(filteredScripts[0]).html() compares correctly
[07:09:59] <kjy112>  /join #ppi
[07:10:14] <fotoflo> $(element).children(":nth-child(2)")
[07:10:15] <fotoflo> got it
[07:14:04] <Taggnostr> Vaerros, 1) I mean that if you copy the .js you also have to copy the .css, and unless you do a separate .css, you'll have to find and copy specific rules in the main .css
[07:14:25] <Taggnostr> Vaerros, if you inline you can just copy the .js file and you have everything you need
[07:15:53] <Ortund> How can I take the string "Gallery/Thumbs/Image1.jpg" and change it to "Gallery/Images/Image1.jpg" ? Bearing in mind, I need to keep the image 1 part
[07:16:18] <IvanKuzev> is there a quick way to set outer width?
[07:16:51] <Ang3> hey guys
[07:17:20] <Ortund> var newstr = $('.imgthumb').src; newstr.replace("/Thumbs/", "/Images/"); ?
[07:18:28] <Ang3> i try to use the datepicker of Jquery UI  - i got some issue. The div i use is generated by a .append() function. I their a way to fix it ?
[07:18:45] <Vaerros> Taggnostr: if you honestly think that's the better solution, by all means go ahead
[07:18:50] <Ortund> bleh I'm being stupid, I'll build the full path to the image with + and then just get the filename
[07:19:53] <Taggnostr> Vaerros, I'm evaluating the pros and cons, having a separate file with all the js-related style might be better indeed
[07:22:55] <zjk> any manner for getting an event triggered when i defocus the navigator's page or open a new tab in firefox ?
[07:23:39] <zjk> (i want to pause animation when the page is not on focus)
[07:28:07] <inki> hi
[07:28:17] <JesperA> hi
[07:28:42] <jmaister> Can someone tell me why this table won't scale to half size? http://jsfiddle.net/E5CXB/
[07:29:05] <inki> i want to create a new span and append it to a div. that looks easy so far, but the new span should also react to events
[07:29:21] <inki> so i have to re-bind or something
[07:29:55] <Vaerros> inki: if I understand your problem, sounds like you want to use live events
[07:30:12] <inki> sounds very cool - how? :-)
[07:30:21] <jeffsmykil> thought live was obsolete now
[07:30:39] <Vaerros> obsolete how?
[07:30:51] <jeffsmykil> i thought i read somewhere , probably on the live page
[07:30:54] <jeffsmykil> there is a new way to do it
[07:30:58] <Double_Rainbow> join ##php
[07:31:03] <Vaerros> ah
[07:31:20] <inki> i can't just create a span element, add a function to click and there we go?
[07:31:21] <jeffsmykil> As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use http://api.jquery.com/on/ to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ in preference to .live().
[07:31:27] <Vaerros> right
[07:37:41] <inki> .on() works like a charm
[07:37:43] <inki> thx
[07:38:06] <Kzim> hello
[07:39:35] <Ungy> with dynamically added elements how can i determine position?
[07:40:07] <Kzim> i just have a little question about building an application with Jquery. i mean i usually use jquery for small plugin but now i have to build a rich applications. i Find it hard because i don't know well JS. i mean is jQuery a good way to build a rich application ?
[07:41:26] <Kzim> perhaps i don't understand well the logic, for exemple i loaded a table in ajax with JSON then to edit i tried to .load() a form in a model but then the JS in the modal didn't work to send the form. do i have to build all in a .js and load all the ui at once ?
[07:42:31] <digitalfiz> hey guys is there a way to catch the clicks of the mouse when its the mouse wheel? like my mouse wheel can tilt back and forth can I catch that?
[07:43:36] <Vaerros> digitalfiz: the real question is would you want to if you could?
[07:43:45] <Ungy> digitalfiz http://www.switchonthecode.com/tutorials/javascript-tutorial-the-scroll-wheel
[07:44:01] <digitalfiz> Vaerros well i want to trigger pagination changes when they use the tilt wheel
[07:44:23] <digitalfiz> it won't be vital but it would be an enhancement for people with a mouse that has tilt wheel
[07:44:28] <walfisch> I have an ie issue sorting dom nodes
[07:44:33] <Vaerros> providing they're aware they can even do that
[07:44:54] <digitalfiz> Vaerros, I'm not worried about informing them of the ability I just need to know how :)
[07:45:09] <walfisch> anyone has a clue why using Array.sort in ff works for this, but not in ie: http://jsfiddle.net/9s2jT/1/
[07:45:09] <digitalfiz> thank Ungy
[07:45:15] <digitalfiz> thanks
[07:45:17] <Vaerros> ugh
[07:48:51] <aro> is there a limit to the length of ID's that jquery can match on?
[07:49:53] <Ungy> with dynamically added elements how can i determine position?
[07:49:55] <inki> i have <div id="foo"><span class="bar>..</span><span class="bar>..</span><span class="bar>..</span></div> - how can I remove() all the spans?
[07:50:15] <Ungy> inki look at each
[07:50:18] <inki> there's <span class="bar>..</span> in other contexts, so I cannot just do $('.bar').remove();
[07:50:32] <inki> Ungy: can't I just do a single nifty selector?
[07:50:59] <aro> $('div#foo').find('span.bar').remove();
[07:51:04] <inki> alright
[07:52:59] <inki> works, thx
[07:54:30] <daslicht> can u databind on change of a variable ? myVar.onchange ?
[07:56:29] <Ungy> aro that is much better then using each I think I will keep that one in mind
[07:59:11] <inki> Ungy you might as well use puctuation hehe you know well we might understand you better
[07:59:50] <chrisvwebdev> hello everyone
[07:59:58] <Ungy> OK I have a popup that is dynamically positioned based on where the user clicks inside this popup I dynamically display a div based on a hover over how can I get the positioning of the hover over as $('#a.link').position() returns null?
[08:00:22] <chrisvwebdev> i have a question about type conversion from jquery object to string type
[08:00:45] <chrisvwebdev> if i have an single element from a wrapped set, what is the best way to convert it over to a string?
[08:01:36] <Ungy> chrisvwebdev your tryign to convert object to string?
[08:02:40] <daslicht> object+''
[08:02:42] <daslicht> :)
[08:04:20] <khmer> chrisvwebdev: do you mean you want a representation of each node as html?
[08:04:33] <Ungy> daslicht that is soo cheap.
[08:08:02] <khmer> walfisch: because Array.sort doesn't exist in IE!
[08:09:48] <walfisch> khmer: at least not with a function as an argument (I just learned the hard way), thank you
[08:18:27] <xckpd7> question: is pub/sub a performance gain instead of checking the dom to see if an ID exists?
[08:19:25] <xckpd7> for instance I'm including a widget on a couple of pages, and on all of my pages I'm just checking at the top level to see if it exists... I'm wondering if there might be a better way to do it, implentation and speed wise
[08:21:09] <techouse> xckpd7: why not just make a php condition to check if it's the page that the widget it's supposed to be on is the current page or not?
[08:21:29] <techouse> and upon that include the js or not
[08:21:33] <khmer> xckpd7: if that widget throws events as it's being created, subscribe to those events!
[08:22:21] <techouse> ^+1
[08:22:52] <xckpd7> khmer: so pub/sub?
[08:23:07] <xckpd7> sorry I'm not too well versed with Javascript...
[08:24:01] <khmer> xckpd7: yeah, pub/sub is the pattern, although typically that actual term is not used much
[08:24:19] <khmer> xckpd7: since pub sub is such an integral part of the modern javascript model.
[08:24:27] <khmer> xckpd7: is this, like, a jquery ui widget?
[08:24:38] <xckpd7> it will be
[08:25:09] <xckpd7> currently I'm studying prototypes which jQuery widget factory apparently uses
[08:25:23] <xckpd7> but I'm looking at the application I'm working on, and I can't help but to think this could be done better
[08:25:37] <xckpd7> so I know about the pub/sub libraries and I'm just trying to research the best way to go about things
[08:26:01] <khmer> xckpd7: so, the widget has an init method. the simplest way to do this is to add a trigger call to the init method
[08:26:32] <khmer> $(document).trigger('create.widgetName');
[08:27:03] <khmer> and then, whenever the widget is created, anywhere in the document, that event will occur
[08:27:24] <xckpd7> khmer: isn't that bad form? or is the widget internals set up to handle that?
[08:27:50] <khmer> if the widget factory already does that, i would be pleasantly surprised
[08:27:53] <khmer> and you can subscribe to it elsewhere. that way you don't have to put some other logic that has nothing to do with creating the widget
[08:28:01] <khmer> in the widget's create method.
[08:28:49] <xckpd7> khmer: excellent, I'm bookmarking this transcript. Thanks for the advice!
[08:28:58] <khmer> no problem!
[08:33:48] <chrisvwebdev> @hkmer
[08:34:23] <chrisvwebdev> hi.  thanks for the feedback.  no, i need the data as a javascript string type, not html
[08:35:49] <chrisvwebdev> so for example if i select all inputs in a form and grab their values using .each(function(){ var inputVal = $(this).val(); }, i would like it to be in a string type with no reference to the jquery object
[08:36:35] <chrisvwebdev> i ask this because when i store that value and handle the string in ie7, i get an error saying i9 can't use string methods on an object
[08:36:41] <khmer> chrisvwebdev: you want to turn a jquery object full of inputs into an array of strings representing the values of those inputs?
[08:38:05] <chrisvwebdev> @khmer, correct.  i tried using the .toArray() method, but i believe the value of that method returned an error as i looped the array...there was still some sort of refernece to the jquery object
[08:38:07] <chrisvwebdev> -
[08:39:02] <khmer> ?map @ chrisvwebdev
[08:39:02] <bot-t> chrisvwebdev, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[08:46:51] <blazedd> Anyone have a better solution for jquery mobile + Google Mobile Adwords than this? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/google-adsense-javascript-breaks-ajax-transitions
[08:53:37] <chrisvwebdev> map it is!  thanks guys...
[08:54:33] <rookie84> hi there.
[08:54:47] <rookie84> ui.item.children('.save, .close').click(function(e) { alert('hi'); });
[08:55:02] <rookie84> when some ones clicks on the save button why do i get a hi dialog box 2 times?
[08:55:38] <rookie84> ui.item = <li> <img src="close.gif" class=".save"></li>
[08:55:42] <rookie84> any idea please.
[08:57:52] <rookie84> anyone?
[09:03:11] <inki> i have <div id="foo"> and in that multiple <span class="bar" data-x="123">, where 123 is a unique integer
[09:03:24] <inki> i want to remove all spans with data-x > y
[09:03:31] <inki> how would i do that?
[09:03:46] <Aric> Question :: http://pastie.org/2970306 --- I'm using .validate() and it validates when i submit the form but not as i type in the field, the Validate Demo does - here, http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/
[09:04:22] <VictorCL> ehhh time to go :)
[09:04:58] <JesperA> inki: http://jsfiddle.net/DkYCH/
[09:05:00] <Vaerros> inki: any number of ways, but I'm thinking .filter(function() { [return true if data-x > y] })
[09:05:11] <JesperA> its messy, and alot of stuff you dont need, but it works
[09:05:25] <JesperA> just strip out the stuff you dont need and rename the attribute in data
[09:15:59] <Aric> I tried to do a JS Fiddle but the validation isn't working at all:: http://jsfiddle.net/cruEd/
[09:20:32] <inki> if i do multiple on('click', function()) on the very same element, do they get replaced or accumulated?
[09:23:54] <rookie84> ui.item.children('.save, .close').click(function(e) { alert('hi'); });
[09:24:00] <rookie84> when some ones clicks on the save button why do i get a hi dialog box 2 times?
[09:24:09] <rookie84> ui.item = <li> <img src="close.gif" class=".save"></li>
[09:24:15] <rookie84> any idea why this is happening?
[09:25:34] <tom___> rookie84: can you put it in a fiddle?
[09:25:45] <rookie84> it is alot of code and you'll not like it.
[09:26:03] <tom___> oh. then just create a trivial example
[09:26:09] <rookie84> ok
[09:26:19] <rookie84> i'm using draggable and sortable
[09:26:22] <raver> what plugin would you recommend for easy loading of an ajax page into a modal window?
[09:26:30] <rookie84> drag items into the sortable area
[09:26:42] <rookie84> these items are basically <li>'s as you know
[09:26:45] <tom___> are those involved in this pathology?
[09:26:50] <tom___> if not, exclude them
[09:26:51] <makeshiftwings> Wondering if anyone can help me out. I'm using toggle() to show/hide multiple divs. I want it to check a particular div though to make sure it hasn't already been hidden before it toggles it. Anyone have any ideas? Some sort of if statement or something that checks to make sure it hasn't been toggled already
[09:27:02] <rookie84> and <li> <img src="close.gif" class=".save"></li> <-- this is the sortable area
[09:27:09] <rookie84> ui.item.children('.save, .close').click(function(e) { alert('hi'); });
[09:27:15] <rookie84> this is what i'm doing
[09:27:32] <Vaerros> makeshiftwings: sounds like you want :visible
[09:27:48] <rookie84> if i sort the sortable, meaning if i sort the <li>'s and then click on the .close link, it gets executed several times.
[09:27:48] <makeshiftwings> what does the if statement look like in jquery?
[09:27:53] <tom___> what are the elemnts with .close?
[09:27:54] <rookie84> and i get several "hi" alert boxes
[09:28:01] <rookie84> elements?
[09:28:06] <tom___> hang on
[09:28:13] <rookie84> ok
[09:28:26] <tom___> ui.item.children('.save, .close').off().click(function(e) { alert('hi'); });
[09:28:32] <tom___> that's 1.7 syntax
[09:28:44] <tom___> what's the 1.6 version?
[09:28:45] <rookie84> what is the .off() for ? (i am using 1.7 )
[09:29:00] <tom___> ask the API spec, not me!
[09:29:22] <rookie84> let me check if this will work.
[09:29:55] <rookie84> ok removes an event handler and reattaches it.
[09:30:00] <rookie84> in what you wrote.
[09:30:28] <tom___> you might have attached the same handler more than once. doing off() should get rid of all but one
[09:30:48] <rookie84> ok
[09:31:13] <tom___> you might need .off('click') if you bound other events to same elemnents
[09:31:34] <rookie84> hmm ok
[09:33:32] <rookie84> tom: strange, applied your technique and it disables it completely.
[09:33:47] <rookie84> not this but another function $('.expand).slideToggle();
[09:34:06] <rookie84> it would not slide down after i do .off() for the .save, .close
[09:34:17] <tom___> you may need to reatach that handler
[09:34:26] <tom___> or take another approach
[09:34:30] <tom___> bottom line:
[09:34:52] <tom___> you've inadvertently attached the same handler more than once to an element
[09:34:59] <tom___> either don't do that or
[09:35:12] <tom___> get rid of the excess
[09:35:59] <rookie84> check this out..
[09:36:00] <rookie84> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/516722/
[09:36:01] <tom___> rookie84 said:Â Â  it is alot of code and you'll not like it.
[09:36:15] <rookie84> check line 111
[09:36:16] <tom___> that's probably why you made the slip up
[09:36:36] <tom___> there are only 83 lines
[09:37:01] <rookie84> yesterday i had a question here on jquery with 50 lines and a humble guy did'nt liked it :)
[09:37:46] <tom___> from this it is possible that ui.item.children('.save, .close') selects some items that ui.item.children('.expand') also selects
[09:37:58] <tom___> this may be the root problem
[09:38:13] <rookie84> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/516723/ <-- this is the whole code (including html)
[09:38:34] <rookie84> check line 175
[09:38:39] <rookie84> and you'll see what .expand is.
[09:38:57] <tom___> btw, put the JS at the end before </body>
[09:39:10] <rookie84> hmm ok
[09:39:51] <arvindravi> hi all,so i have a page with multiple posts where each post has a button that slidetoggles a div under it,but only the first two slidetoggles are smooth others in the page are just murky,they just toggle instantly with a jerk and go to the start of the page automaticall. I would appreciate any help!
[09:40:31] <arvindravi> how do i get all the slideToggles working smoothly?
[09:40:33] <tom___> i suggest you get rid of empty spans
[09:41:04] <tom___> the css may be making them clickable
[09:41:06] <tom___> i think it is
[09:41:26] <arvindravi> tom___: thanks,I'm a newbie,bear with me,can you explain?
[09:41:27] <rookie84>  <span class="expand" ></span> <-- this has a background image of a down arrow
[09:41:59] <rookie84> arvindravi: specify a height maybe that fixes the issue?
[09:42:02] <tom___> arvindravi: my reply was to rookie84, i haven't read your question
[09:42:13] <arvindravi> tom___: sorry then
[09:42:20] <tom___> no worries
[09:42:28] <rookie84> tom: i do want to make it clickable
[09:42:45] <tom___> even when there's no content in teh span?
[09:43:15] <tom___> in which case, you need to position them differently because they are on top of each other at the moment
[09:43:26] <rookie84> <img class="save" src="images/save.png"/>
[09:43:30] <rookie84> btw this is the save thing.
[09:43:45] <rookie84> yes, it has a height and width a backgorund image
[09:44:42] <tom___> try to make it work with position relatve
[09:44:49] <rookie84> arvindravi: don't pm please.
[09:45:04] <arvindravi> rookie84: sorry about that
[09:45:11] <tom___> or just get rid of the spans and work on the img elements
[09:45:14] <rookie84> arvindravi: do some google for the jerking thing..
[09:45:18] <rookie84> hmm ok
[09:45:25] <rookie84> i'll get rid of the spans
[09:46:23] <takahiro> anyone see why clicking cancel doesn't show anything here? http://jsfiddle.net/MRfdx/
[09:46:49] <tom___> rookie84: http://jsfiddle.net/BEDxR/
[09:47:23] <rookie84> ok
[09:48:04] <rookie84> hmm what did you change?
[09:48:47] <tom___> nothing
[09:49:48] <rookie84> ok i thought you changed something.
[09:50:13] <tom___> sort out the positioning of the close save and expand buttons, then we take another look.
[09:50:21] <rookie84> anyway after removing span's its not working still (i.e executes the ui.item.children('.save, .close').click(function(e) { more than twice)
[09:50:22] <tom___> start with just inline block elements
[09:50:32] <Woet> ?demo @ rookie84
[09:50:33] <bot-t> rookie84, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[09:50:38] <Woet> sorry if i missed it.
[09:50:45] <Zzaichik> takahiro: nothing is closed properly
[09:50:54] <tom___> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/BEDxR/
[09:50:54] <rookie84> Woet: tom__ just did it for me, thanks to him.
[09:51:35] <takahiro> Zzaichik: oh
[09:52:17] <takahiro> thanks Zz
[09:52:23] <Zzaichik> takahiro: np
[09:52:37] <rookie84> tom: ui.item.children('.save').show(); <-- you think this is fine right?
[09:53:33] <rookie84> oh i may have forgotten to tell you that for the first time it executes fine, when i sort the widget(<li>) i.e change the order and then click on the save link again it causes more than two executes.
[09:53:47] <tom___> JSfiddle QUESTION: how do you get line numbers to show?
[09:54:01] <tom___> i noticed
[09:54:02] <rookie84> yeh i have the same question, just wondered :)
[09:54:23] <tom___> somebody here must know how or that it can't be done
[09:54:49] <rookie84> not good if it can't be done.
[09:55:23] <tom___> the .shows() may be redundant but they don't do any hard
[09:55:44] <tom___> i googled jsfiddle "line numbers" and came up empty
[09:56:27] <rookie84> .show() just shows the icon after it has been dropped into the sortable.
[09:59:08] <tom___> try the php dragable now: http://jsfiddle.net/BEDxR/2/
[09:59:18] <rookie84> ok
[09:59:30] <tom___> and then use dev tools to find where the second event is coming from
[09:59:43] <tom___> us breakpoints
[09:59:48] <tom___> *use
[10:00:13] <rookie84> did you notice how it executes 2 or more times when you do the sorting?
[10:03:00] <tom___> rookie84: yes
[10:03:56] <tom___> rookie84: try my version
[10:04:20] <tom___> does it have the same many times thing happening?
[10:04:25] <tom___> http://jsfiddle.net/BEDxR/2/
[10:05:15] <rookie84> ok, same problem
[10:05:18] <rookie84> executes more than once.
[10:08:16] <halcyon1234> My "oncomplete" from .toggle fires once per element hidden. Is there a callback from .toggle that fires only once, when ALL elements are done animating?
[10:08:17] <halcyon1234>     <div class="ui-widget-content">First Stuff</div>
[10:08:21] <halcyon1234> http://jsfiddle.net/BqjzX/
[10:08:27] <halcyon1234> (sorry abotu the <div> =) )
[10:11:23] <chee> you will be
[10:12:59] <rookie84> tom__: looks like it has something to do with the sortable update thing
[10:13:15] <rookie84> actually it has.
[10:16:19] <vzlahagen> hi people...
[10:17:18] <vzlahagen> so this is it.. i have a very simple function which uses slideToggle and load methods so hide/show a div and fill it with some html
[10:17:38] <vzlahagen> everything works perfect until i needed to create a jquery gallery inside that div...
[10:19:32] <vzlahagen> i cant 'activate' the plugin from the div coz' it is not visible -yet- (which means, it is not created)
[10:20:11] <vzlahagen> i can pastebin the code if you need to look at it... my question is: a jquery plugin (or object) is destroyed if i remove the DOM element associated with it?
[10:20:25] <vzlahagen> thanks in advance
[10:22:42] <takahiro> how can i make this google link clickable? http://jsfiddle.net/MRfdx/1/
[10:24:33] <vzlahagen> @takahiro: what about making it a div and then associate .click to it?
[10:25:08] <takahiro> make what a div?
[10:25:23] <vzlahagen> @takahiro: let me write it and we can discuss it ok?
[10:26:14] <ravenzz> takahiro #clickable a { display:block }
[10:27:01] <devOlsen> morning.
[10:27:08] <ravenzz> evening.
[10:27:36] <takahiro> ravenzz: that messed up the formatting of the link in the paragraph
[10:27:55] <ravenzz> i can't see any paragraph there
[10:27:55] <vzlahagen> afternoon.
[10:28:02] <ravenzz> show me the real scenario then
[10:28:26] <takahiro> ravenzz: http://thorie.com/exercise/3col.php
[10:28:37] <takahiro> ravenzz: see the link in the middle of the page?
[10:28:52] <ravenzz> jama.ama-ASSn.org?
[10:28:57] <takahiro> yeah
[10:28:59] <ravenzz> k
[10:29:10] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[10:29:34] <takahiro> wait.. refresh the page first, then ctrl-click on that link
[10:29:54] <takahiro> it doesn't go to the link, instead, it goes to editing mode - i want editing mode to work for the whole div, but not when you click links
[10:30:53] <ravenzz> ok
[10:31:46] <takahiro> links might appear in paragraphs, for images, etc. and i want to keep the look as if it's the original link
[10:32:44] <ravenzz> which plugin is related to this editor?
[10:33:00] <takahiro> it's just a <textarea>
[10:33:10] <takahiro> it's not any special editor
[10:33:48] <xckpd7> question: anyway to reduce screen tearing for jQuery slideshow plugins?
[10:34:10] <xckpd7> I'm sliding images and it looks very weird even on my MacBook Pro monitor
[10:34:27] <takahiro> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/MRfdx/2/
[10:34:40] <takahiro> this seems to work, but do you see any bugs with it?
[10:35:08] <takahiro> i don't really like the way i used a variable to track if a link was clicked, i wish there was a more native way
[10:36:18] <darkangel> Can someone please help me with this: http://pastie.org/private/icg6qgjg8fnfkbyvxzdqq -- I'm want to invoke a method in a widget and have "this" refer to the widget and not the element.
[10:36:31] <darkangel> *I want
[10:38:13] <takahiro> why don't you pass the widget into the showMenu function?
[10:38:49] <ravenzz> takahiro what about $('section').children(':not("a")').click(editClicked);
[10:38:57] <takahiro> ah
[10:39:00] <takahiro> let me try that ravenzz
[10:40:02] <darkangel> takahiro: I'm not sure how to, and ideally I would prefer not to have to, so that users could call "showMenu" with no arguments.
[10:40:27] <takahiro> darkangel: yeah that makes sense
[10:40:42] <takahiro> darkangel: there's probably a way to refer to it, i just dont know
[10:40:49] <darkangel> k
[10:42:10] <takahiro> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/MRfdx/3/ - didnt work, clicking the gray area doesnt trigger the function
[10:45:02] <Eviltwin> takahiro: Sorry, just got here
[10:45:08] <Eviltwin> Can you explain the goal again?
[10:46:08] <cOsticla> hi, I'm trying to raise a click event for 3 elements but just when I click one of them (no matter which one). my code is: $("span, p, div").click(function() {alert('OK');})
[10:46:20] <takahiro> Eviltwin: trying to make the gray area clickable for an event to happen, but not the links
[10:46:27] <cOsticla> my code however raise a click event for each click I do
[10:46:41] <takahiro> Eviltwin: i want links to navigate, just like normal links
[10:46:46] <cOsticla> can anyone please help me with this?
[10:47:50] <takahiro> cOsticla : are you sure that comma syntax is right?
[10:48:23] <cOsticla> my code works. there's no problem I can see with it
[10:48:42] <cOsticla> however I only need one alert window when I click on one element (no matter which one)
[10:49:06] <takahiro> cOsticla : are the elements nested?
[10:50:08] <takahiro> put a "return false;" after the alert so you only get one
[10:50:08] <cOsticla> no, they actually are not
[10:50:45] <ravenzz> use preventDefault() instead of false
[10:50:48] <Eviltwin> takahiro: http://jsfiddle.net/MRfdx/6/
[10:51:06] <takahiro> oh cool Eviltwin
[10:51:32] <takahiro> thank u !
[10:51:37] <cOsticla> that wouldn't solve my issue
[10:51:53] <Eviltwin> cOsticla: I'm pretty sure I didn't say it would
[10:52:20] <cOsticla> sorry, I was talking to takahiro
[10:53:09] <Eviltwin> So you want to bind the click listener once?
[10:53:17] <Eviltwin> As in it only fires one time
[10:53:51] <cOsticla> what I am looking for is something like: SHOW alert window if CLICK on X or Y or Z when X and Y and Z exists
[10:54:13] <cOsticla> not sure my explanation is the best around...
[10:55:39] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/nbXJe/
[10:56:34] <Eviltwin> Wait, waht?
[10:56:36] <Eviltwin> what*
[10:56:43] <Eviltwin> Explain a little further
[10:57:20] <cOsticla> @Eviltwin - the jQuery code should check if the three elements are on the page
[10:57:30] <cOsticla> and when I click one of them to fire an alert window
[10:57:34] <halcyon1234> My .toggle complete callback fires once per element hidden. Is there a callback from .toggle that fires only once, when ALL elements are done animating? http://jsfiddle.net/BqjzX/
[10:58:46] <takahiro> eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/MRfdx/7/ - any idea why the google link ctrl-click doesn't work?
[10:59:38] <Eviltwin> takahiro: It's to do with jsFiddle. Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/MRfdx/7/show/
[10:59:57] <takahiro> eviltwin: still doesnt work there
[11:00:06] <takahiro> yahoo link works, google doesnt
[11:00:33] <Eviltwin> cOsticla: So are you saying all three elements need to exist?
[11:00:57] <takahiro> i think the ctrl key press is some kind of event propagation too
[11:01:21] <Eviltwin> Is it happening here? http://jsfiddle.net/MRfdx/7/show/
[11:01:22] <cOsticla> yes, they need to be all on the same page and when I click just one of them (no matter which one) to get that alert window
[11:01:26] <takahiro> Eviltwin: yes
[11:01:42] <takahiro> Eviltwin: same problem even on there, at least on my browser
[11:01:59] <takahiro> oh man
[11:02:04] <takahiro> works in Google Chrome, but doesnt work in Firefox
[11:02:16] <takahiro> how weird!
[11:02:18] <Eviltwin> cOsticla: So they may not exist currently but will exist in the future?
[11:02:34] <takahiro> is that a firefox bug ?
[11:03:28] <cOsticla> they exist on the page
[11:03:52] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: he's basically saying that 3 elements are on the page. If he clicks any 3 elements, the logic should make sure that those 3 elements exist on the page before showing the alert window
[11:04:10] <xckpd7> whoops should have scrolled down first, nvm
[11:05:04] <Eviltwin> cOsticla: Still not understanding the goal then
[11:05:10] <Eviltwin> If they all exist on the page
[11:05:38] <cOsticla> look, I have three different elements on the page and when I click no matter which one, to only get an alert window
[11:06:02] <Eviltwin> cOsticla: Okay... did you look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/nbXJe/
[11:06:03] <cOsticla> my code actually shows three altert windows for each element I will click
[11:06:09] <xckpd7> so bind 3 different click events to each one, done
[11:06:22] <Eviltwin> I sent it right after you explained the problem to me
[11:06:32] <Eviltwin> Is that what you're looking for?
[11:06:52] <Eviltwin> If not, what's wrong?
[11:07:47] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: I like how you split off the click handler into it's own function... never seen that done before, though it makes sense
[11:07:56] <cOsticla> I'd need to do this with jQuery selectors
[11:07:59] <vsmith> hey guys i have a js jquery error in my script but not sure where it is.  This is where the script is found  http://philoveracity.com/shafteldiamonds/wp-content/themes/ShaftelTheme/_/js/script-starter.js?ver=1
[11:08:13] <cOsticla> I must have said that I am clearly a newbie
[11:08:19] <Eviltwin> cOsticla: Do you not see the jQuery selector?
[11:08:19] <vsmith> could someone help me
[11:08:21] <xckpd7> cOsticla: he is doing it with jQuery selectors
[11:08:24] <vsmith> ?
[11:08:36] <xckpd7> cOsticla: you can just get rid of the variable and use jQuery selectors there
[11:08:50] <xckpd7> $("span, p, div").bind(blah blah)
[11:09:40] <cOsticla> yeap!
[11:09:40] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: I only did that to illustrate that they're working on the same elements
[11:09:59] <cOsticla> I am a confuse. You are right.
[11:10:01] <cOsticla> thanks!
[11:10:03] <Eviltwin> vsmith: I've never worked with CloudCarousel or fancybox so probably not
[11:11:21] <vsmith> Eviltwin:  the error it's giving me is Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[11:11:44] <Eviltwin> vsmith: Are you using Firebug or something?
[11:12:07] <vsmith> yes i am using the inspector in chrome
[11:12:23] <Eviltwin> If you click that error, it should show you where
[11:13:40] <vsmith> yeah it says its on line 1 but the only thing there is the beginning of a multiline comment
[11:15:40] <Eviltwin> vsmith: You sure it's that script?
[11:16:24] <vsmith> yeah, that's what the browser is saying.
[11:18:51] <imsky> mmm it's a good day
[11:18:56] <imsky> for rain
[11:20:42] <Eviltwin> vsmith: Can you change this script or no?
[11:20:44] <vsmith> Eviltwin:  I got rid of the error by deleting the comments at the top
[11:20:59] <Eviltwin> K
[11:21:02] <Eviltwin> Oh
[11:21:03] <Eviltwin> I know why
[11:21:04] <vsmith> it's no longer shiwing in chrome thanks
[11:21:07] <vsmith> why
[11:21:23] <Eviltwin> You see how they have "<html>" there?
[11:21:31] <vsmith> yes
[11:21:35] <Eviltwin> The browsers parses HTML first
[11:21:48] <Eviltwin> So it sees that an HTML tag
[11:21:53] <Eviltwin> Which throws it off
[11:21:57] <vsmith> oh
[11:22:22] <vsmith> thats weir
[11:22:23] <Whirl3d> is snover in here?
[11:22:24] <vsmith> weird
[11:23:16] <snover> Whirl3d: If only there was some sort of list of users for a channel that you could reference to determine whether or not someone was in it :)
[11:23:38] <Whirl3d> lol. Lots o people lurk. Like yourself, I might add.
[11:24:07] <Whirl3d> Perhaps I should have said, is snover "live" or something....Still, I'm psyched you responded.
[11:24:14] <imsky> lol
[11:24:17] <imsky> snover you got a fanclub
[11:26:19] <Eviltwin> Anyone who uses .live is an asshole
[11:26:40] <Whirl3d> lol
[11:26:53] <chee> lol
[11:28:20] <imsky> almost true
[11:28:37] <imsky> anyone who exclusively uses .live and asks why their shit doesn't work in #jquery is an asshole
[11:28:59] <Eviltwin> Anyone who uses .live when .delegate is available is an asshole
[11:29:18] <imsky> anyone who still uses .delegate when the hipsters have moved on to .on is a demi-asshole
[11:31:51] <takahiro> Eviltwin: your suggestion was good, but there were browser issues with ctrl-click so i found a workaround: checking $(event.target).is('a') in the click function for section
[11:32:23] <imsky> damn that's pretty compact
[11:33:09] <takahiro> is chrome known to have some jquery keypress issues?
[11:35:32] <takahiro> binding esc (keycode = 27) doesn't seem to work in chrome
[11:35:45] <takahiro> s/binding/capturing
[11:36:45] <takahiro> i should use a different key for cancel... any suggestions?
[11:37:21] <Eviltwin> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html
[11:37:34] <Eviltwin> Super useful site
[11:37:55] <takahiro> bookmarked
[11:38:54] <takahiro> it doesn't mention chrome, but do i assume safari is the same?
[11:39:35] <Eviltwin> Safari's engine is WebKit which was used to make Chrome
[11:39:46] <Eviltwin> It should be almost identical
[11:39:50] <takahiro> cool
[11:40:42] <takahiro> super good, it works now
[11:40:47] <vsmith> i have another question:  I am attempting to use a jquery plugin called FancyBox for my site for a youtube video.  The first time i connected it everything worked. but now for some reason when i click on the link that used to call the FancyBox it goes to the youtube site instead of returning false & calling FancyBox.  Any idea of what could have happened?
[11:40:59] <takahiro> keypress() to capture "Esc" didnt work, but keyup() did work
[11:41:13] <vsmith> the site:  http://philoveracity.com/shafteldiamonds/home/
[11:44:39] <imsky> real Gs move in silence like lasagna
[11:46:06] <Eviltwin> Lasagna sounds good right now
[11:46:50] <halcyon1234> vsmith: d.onCleanup is not a function, in your plugins.js
[11:47:05] <halcyon1234> Something in your js is breaking, which kills all other js (including fancybox)
[11:47:32] <vsmith> okay
[11:47:47] <vsmith> just trying to figure out what it could be
[11:48:11] <halcyon1234> Install Firebug and Web Developer Toolbar (for Firefox), and it'll help you narrow it down with line numbers and error messages.
[11:48:29] <snover> ?nopm @ Whirl3d
[11:48:30] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[11:48:48] <Whirl3d> Sorry, it was off topic
[11:48:51] <Whirl3d> nevermind.
[11:50:38] <vsmith> halcyon1234:  I have them both just a novice with error and troubleshooting
[11:53:51] <ColKurtz> Just curious, what's faster, jquery selectors, or selector/filter/traversal methods?
[11:54:11] <Eviltwin> It depends a bit
[11:54:31] <joikus> what's a clean way to prevent these characters from an input text:  "Ã©Ã " etc
[11:54:33] <Eviltwin> But one important thing to understand is that jQuery uses the Sizzle selector engine
[11:54:39] <Eviltwin> Which is processed right to left
[11:55:07] <Eviltwin> So $("table td a") grabs every A tag
[11:55:09] <ColKurtz> For example, $("#filter-type a:not(rel=external)")  vs $("#filter-type a").not("rel=external")
[11:55:34] <Eviltwin> Then traverses up the DOM checking if it has an ancestor that is a TD that has an ancestor that is a TABLE
[11:55:39] <ColKurtz> ah
[11:55:58] <Eviltwin> What you have is one of the few exceptions
[11:56:08] <Eviltwin> If the first thing is an ID, it goes straight to that element
[11:56:12] <Eviltwin> And then searches from there
[11:56:29] <Eviltwin> I believe those are effectively equivalent
[11:56:42] <ColKurtz> using the .not() method looks a little cleaner to me
[11:56:52] <Eviltwin> But I think you need some []'s in there
[11:56:59] <ColKurtz> ah yeah
[11:57:10] <ColKurtz> [rel=external] ?
[11:57:13] <Eviltwin> Yup
[11:57:24] <Eviltwin> Out of curiosity
[11:57:30] <Eviltwin> Why are you selecting all of these
[11:57:42] <Eviltwin> Is it to bind an event listener?
[11:57:51] <ColKurtz> http://corrales.hipcreative.com/visitors/
[11:58:09] <ColKurtz> click the "view all," "lodging," etc. links
[11:58:23] <ColKurtz> they filter the thumbnaisl
[11:58:25] <ColKurtz> thumbnails
[11:59:54] <ColKurtz> but the last one is supposed to be an external link
[12:00:03] <ColKurtz> local businesses
[12:01:09] <ColKurtz> great, worked nicely. Now all I have to do is figure out a way to size and crop those thumbnails correctly :|
[12:02:52] <Fraz> hey
[12:03:05] <Fraz> how would i create a new element and store it in a var/array?
[12:04:19] <Eviltwin> Fraz: var newdiv = $("<div/>");
[12:04:43] <Eviltwin> Fraz: That creates a new DIV that's in what's effectively an array
[12:08:41] <Raydiation> if i use the jquery ui slider, and i set the orientation to vertical, why is the highest value on the top and the lowest on the bottom?
[12:12:25] <richardr> Using Cufon, I've registered a font. By default, without doing any selections it's transforming my h1 tags. Any idea why? In addition to this, if I do add the Cufon.replace('h3'); they seem to have no effect. Any help appreciated. Thanks !
[12:13:11] <Vaerros> richardr: don't use cufon. done :)
[12:13:46] <Jon47> cufon might have made sense 5 years ago, we got woffs now
[12:15:21] <richardr> Vaerros: I don't really have a choice. Would you have any idea why it's acting like that?
[12:16:09] <Vaerros> richardr: no experience with cufon, myself
[12:16:27] <snover> richardr: you always have a choice. cufon is the wrong choice.
[12:17:26] <snover> seriously, it will take less time for you to replace with woff than it will to fix whatever broken thing cufon is doing
[12:17:40] <snover> AND once you do that, users can select text! amazing!
[12:23:28] <danheberden> woff woff
[12:23:53] <richardr> snover: can it be used for proprietary fonts?
[12:23:58] <chee> get down
[12:24:23] <danheberden> ?g ttf to woff

[12:28:43] <apalmer> hey, I know there is a jQuery Mobile channel but It's virtually empty so I thought I'd ask here as well. Is there a way to make a jquery mobile list go to the site it's linking to, instead of doing ajax? I set data-ajax="false" but it is still running the slide transition and for whatever reason is screwing up my next page. I just want to load the next page as if I had a normal link
[12:30:12] <Eviltwin> edgardo: You mean like faded or something?
[12:31:08] <edgardo> no, actually I mean with less repetitive code
[12:31:12] <Eviltwin> Also, personally, I wouldn't bother showing the percentage
[12:31:46] <edgardo> Eviltwin, me neither.. just starting out with jquery
[12:31:59] <edgardo> so I have tro try and implement everything possible :)
[12:33:12] <Eviltwin> edgardo: http://jsfiddle.net/KhjS5/1/
[12:34:04] <Eviltwin> That'll probably blow your mind then
[12:34:35] <edgardo> nah, I knoe ternary :)
[12:34:37] <edgardo> know
[12:34:56] <edgardo> just didn't think of using it it like that ;)
[12:35:19] <edgardo> but that is much cleaner, thanks
[12:37:45] <Eviltwin> Also there's no need to put parantheses around division
[12:37:58] <Eviltwin> You can just do (charsleft/totalchars*100).toFixed(0)
[12:38:25] <edgardo> I was never good at math :)
[12:38:56] <Eviltwin> Well it's a question of operator precedence
[12:39:33] <Eviltwin> Quotients and products have equal precedence
[12:39:40] <Eviltwin> So they done in order from left to right
[12:39:55] <Eviltwin> Where as in a/b+c*d
[12:40:11] <Eviltwin> Would actualyl be parsed as (a/b)+(c*d)
[12:40:33] <Eviltwin> Which is a case where you might want to clarify
[12:40:53] <igcewieling> I'm doing a "live search" sort of thing which generates lots of ajax calls.  It seems like sometimes the ajax calls complete out of the order they were called in.  It is all async, so that is no surprise.  I would prefer to cancel the existing ajax call if a new ajax call needs to run.  As I understand it, I should be able to do something like ah = $.ajax(...); and then do an ah.abort before running the next ajax call.  Is that correct?
[12:41:23] <Eviltwin> igcewieling: I suggest taking a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/pP2Zn/1/
[12:41:30] <Eviltwin> Probably turning down the delay for your needs
[12:42:01] <NackNick> does anyone here have a working demo or somewhere where i can see statwords in use?
[12:42:20] <Eviltwin> But, yes, you would do a var xhr = $.ajax(...); and then if(xhr) xhr.abort(); if you wanted to cancel any existing ones
[12:42:21] <tonyjcamp> Eviltwin: nice link.
[12:42:22] <NackNick> sorry wordStats
[12:42:29] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: 1) that is very close to the code I have and 2) it shows the answer to my question.  Thanks!
[12:43:08] <Eviltwin> You're welcome
[12:44:03] <sanjayb> Eviltwin: oo, that is nice.
[12:44:12] <DemonWitch> WHAT IS THIS CHANNEL
[12:44:41] <Fraz> <Eviltwin> Fraz: var newdiv = $("<div/>"); << i tried this earlier, but my div had a class and id, and was closed with </div>

[12:45:29] <sanjayb> Fraz: $('<div />').addClass("className").attr("id", id) ? sorry, not sure exactly what you're trying to do ..
[12:45:55] <Bankzilla> Your trying to add a class and id to closing divs? :/
[12:46:18] <Fraz> no hehe. just creating a div.
[12:46:27] <Fraz> lemme try what sanjay said
[12:49:46] <Zogot> Whirl3d, you there?
[12:50:24] <Fraz> that doesnt seem to work either
[12:50:45] <Fraz> basically im adding a handle/button for all elements of a certain class
[12:50:55] <Fraz> the div im adding is the handle/button
[12:56:32] <Fraz> i dont see the divs in the page source or rendered on the page
[12:57:45] <Fraz> its there in the dom though
[12:58:53] <Eviltwin> Fraz: The page source can't change once the page loads
[12:59:10] <Eviltwin> JavaScript cannot and will not modify the page source
[12:59:16] <Eviltwin> It can only act on the DOM
[12:59:21] <photosbyme> trying to make my images animate to the left and right using this code but no joy, jsfiddle is validationg correct but must be missing some thing? http://jsfiddle.net/Bonkers/sfz44/
[13:00:06] <Eviltwin> photosbyme: Could you actually throw in some HTML elements that roughly match the structure you have?
[13:00:07] <Fraz> its a while since ive used js/jquery. i seem to remember seeing changes in the page source in the past
[13:00:12] <Fraz> must have imagined it
[13:00:14] <Eviltwin> It'd help us help you
[13:00:32] <photosbyme> does it not show in did add it let me try again
[13:00:34] <Zogot> fraz, whats the issue?
[13:00:38] <Fraz> anyway, either way the divs arnt being rendered
[13:00:49] <Eviltwin> Fraz: As far as I know, no browser does that
[13:00:55] <Eviltwin> It doesn't really make sense to
[13:01:30] <Zogot> Fraz, you trying to add a div to the page?
[13:01:36] <Zogot> With jQuery?
[13:01:42] <Fraz> yeah
[13:01:44] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/3g6sY/
[13:01:47] <Zogot> uber quick writeup
[13:02:15] <photosbyme> http://jsfiddle.net/Bonkers/sfz44/2/     ok
[13:02:36] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ photosbyme
[13:02:37] <bot-t> photosbyme, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[13:02:52] <Fraz> thats what im doing. and ive done this kind of thing many times in the past
[13:02:56] <Fraz> dunno why its not working now:S
[13:03:13] <Zogot> What do you have currently?
[13:04:10] <Fraz> oh wait
[13:04:30] <Fraz> damn cache:S
[13:04:31] <photosbyme> not really sure how to show you further in jsfiddle
[13:04:53] <Eviltwin> photosbyme: I don't want your whole website, I wanted basically just the nav
[13:05:02] <photosbyme> oh ok
[13:05:59] <photosbyme> http://jsfiddle.net/Bonkers/sfz44/4/    this is the navigation
[13:06:21] <photosbyme> i followed this tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkZ1Hf1zWk
[13:07:50] <Eviltwin> This HTML has many references to #carousel but no such element exists
[13:08:34] <Eviltwin> Can you make these image links absolute or something?
[13:08:52] <Eviltwin> Or give them alts or something
[13:09:04] <photosbyme> ok will try, what will that achieve? thanks for helping
[13:09:21] <Eviltwin> I mean in the jsFiddle
[13:09:26] <Eviltwin> So I can see what's going on
[13:09:35] <Eviltwin> I can't tell what you're trying to do
[13:09:58] <photosbyme> ok give me a few minutes and will try
[13:11:57] <Eviltwin> Maybe you could explain what you're trying to do
[13:12:01] <Engin> $('#foo .bar > .zoo:first') ? looks wrong ?
[13:12:26] <Eviltwin> Engin: What are you trying to select?
[13:13:05] <Bankzilla> Engin: why do you have a greater sign in your selectors?
[13:13:08] <Engin> first .zoo child element of .bar which is a descendent of #foo
[13:13:18] <Engin> that is direct child
[13:13:20] <Eviltwin> Bankzilla: It's the child selector instead of hte descdenant selector
[13:13:41] <Eviltwin> Engin: Looks fine to me
[13:14:01] <Engin> .click() doesn't supposed to (emulate) fire the event ?
[13:14:19] <Eviltwin> Engin: Altohugh you might want http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
[13:14:19] <Engin> looks like so, why the fuck it's not triggered!
[13:14:21] <Eviltwin> Not :first
[13:14:21] <Engin> let me double chekc
[13:14:30] <Eviltwin> Although*
[13:16:53] <fission6> does jquery have a truncate method for strings 'some long string made short ... '
[13:17:09] <Eviltwin> fission6: see ?jsisjs
[13:17:10] <bot-t> fission6, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[13:18:50] <fission6> well js doesnt have anything internal does it?
[13:19:07] <Eviltwin> WHen do you want to truncate?
[13:19:16] <Eviltwin> After a certain number of characters?
[13:19:48] <Engin> the problem is .click()
[13:19:50] <Engin> it doesn't work
[13:20:01] <Engin> the selection is correct... when I .hide() it, it hides the correct element
[13:20:08] <Engin> but it can't trigger the click event somehow
[13:20:13] <Eviltwin> Engin: Do the elements exist when you bind it?
[13:20:27] <takahiro> anyone know a good Mac + PC compatible key-click combo that doesn't screw up text highlighting modes?
[13:20:37] <fission6> Eviltwin: yes
[13:20:46] <fission6> preferrable with word bounds
[13:21:11] <Jon47> takahiro - jquery ui adds a "disableSelection()" method which you might find useful
[13:21:14] <Eviltwin> fission6: Simplest is if(str.length > n) str = str.substr(0,n-3)+"...";
[13:21:31] <takahiro> Jon47: i actually don't want to disable selection, it's useful for my context
[13:21:48] <takahiro> Jon47: can i show u my page?
[13:21:48] <Eviltwin> Jon47: You sure about that?
[13:22:13] <takahiro> this page http://thorie.com/exercise/3col.php - if you Ctrl-Click the text, it goes to edit mode
[13:22:33] <takahiro> but on a Mac, ctrl-click is treated as "right-click" so it doesnt work
[13:22:37] <Jon47> eviltwin i think you meant to direct that at someone else maybe?
[13:22:46] <Engin> Eviltwin: they are .appendTo()ed
[13:22:59] <Engin> Eviltwin: .hide() works .click() does not
[13:23:29] <Engin> nope, i'm an idiot... i attached the handler to some other object
[13:23:29] <Eviltwin> When you do $("...") that represents the elements that match that selector at this moment
[13:23:31] <Engin> :)
[13:23:43] <Jon47> takahiro, personally i think overriding default behaviors of the OS UX is generally a bad idea.. although google apps does a nice job of it
[13:24:03] <takahiro> Jon47: yeah, agreed ... any suggestion for an alternative key-combo that is Mac friendly?
[13:24:24] <fission6> Eviltwin: thanks
[13:24:49] <Eviltwin> fission6: That doesn't do word bounds. That costs extra.
[13:24:51] <Jon47> takahiro rather than a key combo, why not provide a little icon to switch to 'edit' mode.. if you are worried about it cluttering up the UI you can even make it only appear when the cursor hovers over the relevent section
[13:25:18] <takahiro> Jon47: that's what i started with, it was ugly and cumbersome to click the edit mode icon
[13:25:41] <takahiro> Jon47: and the hover was pretty bad too, as i moused around, there was a flickering edit icon and it was very distracting
[13:26:02] <Jon47> that's how I'd do it, personally, I bet there's a way to make it slicker.  maybe others have better suggestions, i haven't really thought about the problem much
[13:26:29] <takahiro> yeah i might have to just think about it more
[13:27:39] <Jon47> takahiro as far as I know, flickr pioneered the "in-place" editing you're talking about, oyu might check out how they do it on their site and try to get ideas from there
[13:28:15] <takahiro> yeah i've seen that already
[13:28:53] <SeanLazer> does anyone know what would cause jquery-ui datepicker to not set the widget classes on the element it generates?
[13:29:03] <SeanLazer> i'm just calling $('input.datepicker').datepicker()
[13:29:05] <takahiro> they make it impossible to highlight the text easily
[13:29:27] <Eviltwin> SeanLazer: Perhaps it sees the datepicker class and decides it must already be a datepicker?
[13:29:31] <Eviltwin> I don't know
[13:29:46] <danheberden> SeanLazer sounds like maybe it's erring out before it hits that point
[13:29:52] <danheberden> console log showing anything?
[13:30:03] <danheberden> also, jsfiddle has jqueryui on it so you can make a small demo of the problem
[13:30:09] <danheberden> (jsfiddle.net)
[13:30:12] <SeanLazer> danheberden: no, and the widget works, it just doesn't have the right class
[13:30:38] <danheberden> ya, make a demo of that craziness
[13:30:46] <danheberden> unless you're using an older ui version with newer jq
[13:31:47] <SeanLazer> danheberden: that could be.  the weird part is that i have it another part of my app and it works as expected
[13:31:56] <SeanLazer> though the call is slightly different it has nothing to do with classes
[13:32:05] <SeanLazer> let me check my versions though
[13:34:27] <photosbyme> http://jsfiddle.net/Bonkers/DYHWY/ hope this is better borrowed some images on line from jquery for designers
[13:34:55] <takahiro> $("#carousel nav a") is null
[13:36:20] <fission6> Eviltwin: i found a nice truncate snippet, how would i parameterize the length of 16 though? http://jsfiddle.net/4nQTL/
[13:36:49] <razzi> is there a simple way to calc outer height of multiple p?
[13:37:05] <photosbyme> how do i fix it? I really am a novie at this
[13:37:07] <photosbyme> novice
[13:38:22] <salientKnight> can anyone help me get this code working?  $("div.roll-over-image").mouseover(function(){ $("#produ"+$(this).id).show();});
[13:39:01] <salientKnight> I am trying to show a different div based on the id of the div that was rolled over
[13:39:10] <scar3> im getting this error : "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'split' of undefined" : however, it works on 1 page and not the other.. the only problem is, all the code that runs this is identical on both pages
[13:40:01] <razzi> salientKnight, replace $(this).id by $(this).attr('id')
[13:40:11] <salientKnight> thank you razzi
[13:40:14] <scar3> Hover over client login to bring the tooltip up--- http://ass.boastingbiz.com works, but http://ass.boastingbiz.com/automotive.html does not?? -- error : "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'split' of undefined"
[13:41:16] <razzi> salientKnight, or just by this.id
[13:41:50] <gtrduop> I`ve forgotten a3li for ban-nazi. sorry!
[13:42:00] <SeanLazer> danheberden: i can't seem to recreate the problem on jsfiddle, it works as expected
[13:42:59] <salientKnight> razzi++
[13:42:59] <danheberden> SeanLazer oy, that means there's some weird crazy shit doing on in your codez :(
[13:43:05] <salientKnight> you rock that did the trick thanks
[13:43:18] <danheberden> maybe you can pastie some pieces that you think might be the culprit?
[13:43:19] <SeanLazer> danheberden: actually i think i may have found it... there's a function running called "clearUIClasses()"
[13:43:23] <danheberden> or try to take some things out?
[13:43:24] <danheberden> oh
[13:43:24] <SeanLazer> betcha it's related to that...
[13:43:24] <danheberden> hahahaha
[13:43:26] <photosbyme> anyone?
[13:43:41] <SeanLazer> now i just have to figure out what breaks horribly when i remove that code
[13:44:12] <razzi> is there a simple way to calc outer height of multiple p?
[13:44:20] <danheberden> SeanLazer it's probably some awful way to $( element ).datepicker( 'destroy' ) or similar
[13:44:45] <Fraz> anone here using jquery ui with wordpress?
[13:44:45] <SeanLazer> danheberden: i think it's related to clearing some classes off of some UI tabs that i didn't want to get styled in the same theme
[13:44:46] <danheberden> razzi - either add it up, or put them in a container, append to the dom, get the height, remove
[13:44:55] <ravenzz> scar3 in the second page there is no .contentWrap elements
[13:45:22] <ravenzz> that's why you are experiencing that error
[13:51:25] <razzi> danheberden, when i add them, won't the margins in between the elements be counted twice?
[13:51:26] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/4nQTL/1/ can someone tell me whats wrong with the RegEx i think its somewhere with escaping someting in regards too [\S]
[13:53:46] <danheberden> razzi - ya, it'd give you the "Actual height of X p's stacked on top of eachotehr" or whatever
[13:53:49] <ngharo> didn't this syntax used to work?  $('<div />', {id: 'foo'})
[13:53:55] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/PxB9m/1/ am I doing something dumb?
[13:54:02] <photosbyme> please?
[13:54:08] <danheberden> ngharo aye
[13:54:23] <danheberden> but you're mixing the two
[13:54:50] <danheberden> it's either $( '<div id="foo">hello</div>' ) or $( '<div>', { id: "foo", content: "hello" } )
[13:54:50] <ngharo> eh?
[13:55:05] <fission6> /^.{0,16}[\S]*/, how would that regexp translate into a string if want to construct using RegExp('..')
[13:55:06] <ngharo> hmm
[13:55:13] <ngharo> that explains it.  Thanks danheberden
[13:55:20] <danheberden> the regex for using an object only looks for <tagname> or <tagname/> or <tagname><tagname/>
[13:55:30] <danheberden> though <tagname> is preferered
[13:55:46] <danheberden> fission6 you mean what would that match?
[13:59:46] <fission6> danheberden: no i got it now. http://jsfiddle.net/4nQTL/2/
[13:59:47] <photosbyme> ok if this is null : $("#carousel nav a") why does it work here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkZ1Hf1zWk
[14:05:39] <devOlsen> photosbyme what browser is reporting null?
[14:05:51] <devOlsen> I can't help but assume its cause you are using the HTML5 element "nav"
[14:06:01] <devOlsen> do you have a html5 shimm?
[14:07:37] <photosbyme> hmm i guess not, could try giving them a new class instead of using the nav selector
[14:08:02] <photosbyme> firefox and safari 4
[14:12:32] <photosbyme> f****r is working now
[14:12:42] <photosbyme> thanks devOlsen
[14:12:53] <devOlsen> np man.
[14:13:12] <photosbyme> ;)
[14:13:19] <Fraz> any idea when using click why it seems to be acting as if ive clicked twice?
[14:13:51] <photosbyme> well lets see if it works everywhere else before i get too happy,  still need it to do an infinte loop on it
[14:14:14] <devOlsen> an infinite loop? EEK!
[14:14:34] <devOlsen> two words you never want to put together in front of a room filled with scripters.
[14:15:07] <photosbyme> yeah its a carousel for a designer, it also need the thumbnails to scroll left and right
[14:15:59] <Fraz> http://pastebin.com/fBN50jt4 << this is confirming 1, then confirming 0 straight after
[14:16:03] <Fraz> any idea why?
[14:20:19] <whatthepoop> Fraz: total shot in the dark here (I myself am a jquery/js noob), but does it have anything to do with the event propagation?
[14:21:27] <whatthepoop> Fraz: example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2244320/jquery-click-event-propagation
[14:21:39] <devOlsen> if mode is not set, set it to 0, by the time you come back around again, guess what, mode is set to 0 thus we now set it to 1?
[14:22:35] <Fraz> if !mode = if mode == 0
[14:25:18] <Fraz> whatthepoop, i only have 1 of these elements
[14:25:26] <Fraz> its not like theres 2 overlapping
[14:26:59] <Fraz> devOlsen i should also mention mode is initiated 0/false on page load
[14:27:13] <michaelrtm> im fairly noob with js (idle here to learn ;D) - but with js, don't you need to declare vars before you can use them?
[14:27:13] <hon3y> hello
[14:27:25] <hon3y> is there a reason why one can't use <base href=> in jquery mobile?
[14:27:28] <michaelrtm> oh.. n/m ;D
[14:27:33] <devOlsen> naw, I mixed up 0 with 1.. if you flip flop my numbers in that last statement, I was trying to make a point.
[14:27:42] <devOlsen> that when it comes around again, it is ineed already set.
[14:29:05] <devOlsen> michaelrtm, yes.... but sometimes you have a list of vars and you dont need to state "var" for each one.. like so var one = 1, two= 2, three = 3;
[14:34:36] <hon3y> any of you use jquery mobile?
[14:40:44] <eirikb> Hello. Are there any convenient jQuery functions to help one remove instances from JS Objects?
[14:41:06] <Jon47> remove instances?
[14:41:13] <eirikb> Same as delete
[14:41:24] <Jon47> what is delete lacking
[14:42:22] <eirikb> Nothing, I just though filter or similar would work better, especially to not get concurrent modification errors
[14:44:07] <ShaunR> i want to move an element and it's children, does jquery have a simple way to do this... for do i need to .html() and move the old?
[14:44:47] <eirikb> I guess this is my best option, Jon47? (example) var a = {a:'test', b:'tast', c:'frest'};$.each(a, function(key, val){ if (val.match(/ta/)) delete a[key]})
[14:45:31] <ravenzz> use filter then
[14:45:38] <hon3y> does anyone here use jquery mobile please?
[14:45:54] <hon3y> trying to figure out why <base> won't work
[14:45:57] <hon3y> can't find anything via google
[14:46:30] <eirikb> ravenzz: Was that for me?
[14:46:31] <Jon47> eirikb yeah that seems fine to me.. i find it kind of strange that oyu need to delete all the properties whose names contain a particular string
[14:47:04] <ravenzz> eirikb yes
[14:47:06] <eirikb> Jon47: That was just an example
[14:47:10] <eirikb> ravenzz: I didn't know I could
[14:47:43] <Jon47> eirikb i don't think there's anything in jquery that wraps "delete" type functionality
[14:48:21] <takahiro> ShaunR: isn't everything a move?
[14:48:29] <hon3y> is there a way to change the <base> of a page using jquery?
[14:49:01] <eirikb> Jon47: I would guess that .each would fail because I'm removing properties while I'm looping over them, but it seems to work quite well
[14:50:07] <Jon47> hon3y .. try $('base').. seems to work ok
[14:50:37] <Eviltwin> $('base').prop('href','...')
[14:50:59] <Eviltwin> Or if that doesn't work $("<base/>",{href:"..."}).appendTo("head");
[14:51:09] <Eviltwin> But use of base is discouraged
[14:51:35] <LessSeen> bcuz all ur base r belong to us
[14:51:36] <takahiro> ShaunR: http://jsfiddle.net/NbJTZ/
[14:51:50] <takahiro> i "moved" the div (and all of it's children)
[14:52:05] <eirikb> Jon47: I guess this is what it does? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L630 And it seems for in actually works this way as well.
[14:53:02] <Jon47> eviltwin why is it discouraged?
[14:53:24] <hon3y> thank you jon47
[14:55:25] <andrew9183> ahh jquery is so hard.  how will i ever be a guru like you guys
[14:55:46] <Eviltwin> Jon47: Because the behavior isn't always predictable
[14:56:09] <Jon47> eviltwin you mean across browsers?
[14:56:52] <Eviltwin> For example, if you set the base, add an image, set the base to something else, and add another image
[14:57:02] <Eviltwin> In some cases that makes the first image have the first base
[14:57:06] <Eviltwin> And the second image have the second base
[14:57:11] <Eviltwin> In other cases, they both have the second base
[14:58:48] <LessSeen> and yet noone gets to second base.. :/
[14:58:56] <takahiro> ShaunR did you see my code?
[14:59:14] * LessSeen s'tfu nao
[14:59:42] <ravenzz> eirikb sorry you should use map
[14:59:50] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/ccUWa/
[15:04:11] <eirikb> ravenzz: Does your code actually filter? Also I though map was used to create arrays, but that was probably ES5 only
[15:06:14] <Eviltwin> map doesn't add undefineds
[15:09:12] <eirikb> Eviltwin: But still array, right?
[15:09:24] <eirikb> js> $.map({a:'test', b:'tast', c:'frest'}, function(v,k){return v.match(/ta/)})
[15:10:00] <eirikb> That should as far as I know only return ['ta'], and leave the object (now not know) alone
[15:10:12] <eirikb> Actually I would guess [['ta]]
[15:10:36] <amagee> hey i'm getting a very strange problem where ajaxError is being called, with the xhr's `status` property being 0, for a request which the web server is telling me is returning 200
[15:11:46] <amagee> actually, disregard that
[15:12:12] <amagee> actually no, don't disregard that
[15:12:36] <Eviltwin> IRC channels actually work like ships
[15:12:39] <ravenzz> eirikb yep match returns the matched pattern in this case
[15:12:41] <Eviltwin> So the proper order is "belay that"
[15:12:52] <eirikb> ravenzz: So how does this help?
[15:13:02] <Eviltwin> eirikb: What's the goal?
[15:13:02] <ravenzz> dunno what are you trying to do?
[15:13:22] <amagee> ok, well don't belay that :P
[15:13:31] <eirikb> Eviltwin: Just to remove properties from a JS object, and I was wondering if there was some jQuery function for that, similar to filter
[15:13:50] <Eviltwin> Remove from the original or create a copy that doesn't contain them?
[15:14:00] <eirikb> Remove from the original
[15:15:19] <Eviltwin> eirikb: http://jsfiddle.net/ccUWa/1/
[15:15:50] <eirikb> Eviltwin: Yes that is similar to what I posted eariler
[15:16:19] <Eviltwin> That's probably your best option considering that you want to modify the original
[15:17:36] <ravenzz> use test() instead of match
[15:17:54] <eirikb> Eviltwin: If it was an array, would you use splice, slice, filter or none of those?
[15:18:09] <Eviltwin> Probably $.grep
[15:19:01] <eirikb> Eviltwin: So foo = $.grep(foo, ...)
[15:19:11] <Eviltwin> If it's an array
[15:19:57] <eirikb> That is why I was wondering if there was a similar function of objects and properties, as I find that more readable
[15:20:30] <ravenzz> each is ok
[15:22:03] <eirikb> Thanks for the help
[15:22:54] <ravenzz> if you are going to remove from the original object you don't need to store in the foo var
[15:23:41] <Eviltwin> That's left over from the fork of your code
[15:23:57] <Eviltwin> Since it's not referenced elsewhere, I presumed he'd figure it out
[15:25:00] <eirikb> Indeed I did. I also assume you both saw my previous code to Jon42
[15:25:15] <ravenzz> mh no
[15:31:04] <photosbyme> another basic question, how do i write next, and prev buttons for my gallery?
[15:33:03] <photosbyme> 			<a href='javascript:slide("right");'><img src='images/arrow_right.png' /></a>  I only want to apply it to the thumbnails but it is causing the main images to slide
[15:33:03] <photosbyme> 	
[15:39:08] <thinkclay1> What would be the most efficient way to grab all input fields that just have a title attribute set?
[15:39:35] <thinkclay1> and would it be more efficient to use JQ or JS like: document.querySelectorAll('input[@title]')
[15:40:25] <fission6> thinkclay1: its one in the same for the most part, id focus more on the query vs executing it in js or jq
[15:41:05] <eirikb> thinkclay1: Also remember jQuery uses querySelector where it can, and for the selector I think sizzle goes from right to left
[15:41:28] <eirikb> And then Donald said something about premature optimizations, no? :)
[15:41:38] <thinkclay1> okay good to know
[15:43:01] <eirikb> thinkclay1: ref: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L1136
[15:44:07] <fission6> thinkclay1: document.querySelectorAll('input[title]'), you can drop the @
[15:44:42] <eirikb> thinkclay1: For the selector order I can't see any obvious proof, all for one decrementing loop.
[16:00:31] <someprimetime> right now i have a countdown on a text area. once it gets to a certain # (e.g. > 500) i want to prevent additional input into the text area. any idea how to do this?
[16:00:50] <someprimetime> i was thinking of adding an attribute of disabled to the text area, but that wouldn't really make sense
[16:03:52] <photosbyme> where to go to find code snippets?
[16:04:15] <erichynds> google's probably your best bet.
[16:05:28] <photosbyme> trying, can't find exactly what I am after, so much code seem convoluted
[16:06:09] <erichynds> what are you looking for?
[16:07:27] <photosbyme> to add prev & next buttons to thumbnail images which also link to larger images, then need both sets off images to infinite loop, - its quite alot really
[16:08:56] <benjick> Hi. I'm having some trouble with Nivo Slider. It's just displaying the last image (chrome) but works fine in (ie)
[16:11:59] <ldexterldesign> hey guys, i'm looking for a way to group/structure/format my js - states, procedural interactions, functions etc - is there a standard or etiquette to this?
[16:12:22] <someprimetime> photosbyme: http://snipplr.com/
[16:12:26] <someprimetime> is a good resource.
[16:12:30] <ldexterldesign> ... similar to in css where you might have:
[16:12:35] <someprimetime> although don't rely on it completely
[16:12:35] <ldexterldesign> 1. Defaults (resets)
[16:12:35] <ldexterldesign> 2. Basic (base styling of raw HTML elements. These could be used in a future reset.)
[16:12:35] <ldexterldesign> 3. Links & navigation
[16:12:36] <ldexterldesign> 4. Layout
[16:12:36] <ldexterldesign> 5. Typography
[16:12:36] <ldexterldesign> 6. Colour
[16:12:36] <ldexterldesign> 7. Forms
[16:12:37] <ldexterldesign> 8. Tables
[16:12:38] <someprimetime> good for examples
[16:12:50] <photosbyme> thanks someprimetime
[16:12:53] <someprimetime> np
[16:16:47] <benjick> Hi. I'm having some trouble with Nivo Slider. It's just displaying the last image (chrome) but works fine in (ie)
[16:23:58] <lyrae> Anyone know what's wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/tpgF4u40  the images doesnt animate in =(
[16:24:00] <lyrae> it just show sup
[16:24:40] <takahiro> lyrae: setTimeout returns immediately
[16:25:15] <takahiro> lyrae: the "i" variable within the context of the function will have the value of 10 right away
[16:25:29] <lyrae> oh
[16:25:38] <takahiro> try passing i into the function
[16:26:44] <lyrae> the setTimeOut function? as an argument?
[16:28:00] <takahiro> let's see...
[16:31:50] <takahiro> lyrae: http://jsfiddle.net/RftDK/
[16:32:44] <lyrae> let me see
[16:33:54] <takahiro> to make it less confusing you can see: http://jsfiddle.net/RftDK/1/
[16:34:15] <takahiro> the i is from the forloop and the MyParam is just a regular-old function param
[16:38:19] <danzik171> takahiro: forget which browser, but one of them has poor support for adding params like that i believe.  i generally use a function generator for something like that
[16:38:40] <lyrae> ya still trying here
[16:38:42] <fzzbt> is there a event for knowing when a img has finished its loading? i tried ready but that launches before it's finished and load event doesn't seem to work at all
[16:38:51] <lyrae> a js sleep() function would be nice
[16:38:56] <danheberden> fzzbt - load
[16:39:05] <fzzbt> danheberden: it doesn't seem to work
[16:39:12] <takahiro> danzik: ahh i didn't know that
[16:39:12] <fzzbt> chromium doesn't launch it ever
[16:39:25] <danheberden> fzzbt - is it cached?
[16:39:30] <takahiro> lyrae: there is jquery delay()
[16:39:41] <lyrae> will look
[16:39:56] <lyrae> but
[16:39:56] <danheberden> if you do var $img = $( '<img>' ).bind( 'load', function(e){ console.log( 'loaded' ); } );
[16:40:02] <lyrae> what is a function generator?
[16:40:10] <danheberden> then $img.attr( 'src', 'path/to/img' );
[16:40:15] <fzzbt> danheberden: it can be cached
[16:40:16] <danheberden> the fn never fires?
[16:40:25] <danheberden> maybe put it in a jsfiddle
[16:40:36] <danheberden> with, like, some funny lolcat pic or something
[16:40:51] <fzzbt> ok wait sec
[16:40:56] <danheberden> but the pic better be funny
[16:40:58] <danheberden> or it won't work
[16:41:21] <fzzbt> lol
[16:41:29] <danzik171> lyrae: two things - here's an easy to use sleep function using jQuery Deferreds:  http://jsfiddle.net/Eudpp/1/
[16:42:09] <Eviltwin> danzik171: Seriously, just use setTimeout
[16:42:30] <danheberden> i sure hope they add a setTimeout plugin for jquery soon
[16:42:33] <danzik171> Eviltwin: i never said i use it.  just showing that it's possible.
[16:43:30] <Eviltwin> It's still not a "sleep" function
[16:43:53] <fzzbt> no i cant gettit working
[16:43:59] <danheberden> var sleep = function() { confirm( 'wake up?' ); }
[16:44:20] <danzik171> eh, fine, true.  call it "wait" then.
[16:44:40] <Eviltwin> Call it what it is, a timeout
[16:45:24] <danheberden> Are you waiting or timeout'ing
[16:45:57] <danheberden> if you're waiting, that's more like make a deferred, setTimeout to check.. need to keep waiting? ok, setTimeout again... need to keep waiting? no? RESOLVE THAT BITCH
[16:46:02] <fzzbt> is there way to know the dimensions of the image before it is loaded
[16:46:12] <danheberden> nup
[16:46:27] <fzzbt> the problem is that the image expands after it loads itself fucking up the page
[16:46:44] <fzzbt> or well my autoscrolling thingy
[16:47:17] <danheberden> but you could load the image off-dom
[16:47:27] <lyrae> i still cant get it thogh
[16:47:41] <lyrae> it all goes inside the $("menu a").hover(function  right?
[16:47:44] <fzzbt> danheberden: how do i do that
[16:47:53] <danheberden> fzzbt - like i showed above
[16:47:56] <danheberden> just create the img tag
[16:48:01] <danheberden> add the src
[16:48:06] <danheberden> but don't append it to the dom
[16:48:30] <fzzbt> uhh
[16:48:40] <quazimodo> hey guys
[16:49:25] <initself> anyone able to explain the relationship between the "URL" based API for Google Charts and the Javascript API?
[16:49:26] <quazimodo> im a little confused, i see someone has embedded a jquery.min.js and a jquery.easing.min.js
[16:49:34] <quazimodo> is the easing code in the standard library?
[16:49:46] <lyrae> http://jsfiddle.net/uWQQH/1/ ?
[16:49:47] <initself> there seems to be features that you can pass as query parameters that you can't pass as paramters in javascript.
[16:50:22] <Eviltwin> quazimodo: I believe only linear easing is built-in
[16:50:30] <Eviltwin> These are added by the easing lib: http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/easing.html
[16:50:40] <danheberden> fzzbt http://jsfiddle.net/kdAun/
[16:50:44] <quazimodo> Eviltwin: are these libraries in a stardard place
[16:52:04] <danheberden> fzzbt with the jq way: http://jsfiddle.net/kdAun/1/
[16:52:27] <quazimodo> Eviltwin: mm with the  build your download
[16:52:31] <quazimodo> this seems to have esaing in it?
[16:52:33] <Eviltwin> quazimodo: http://jqueryui.com/download
[16:52:37] <atrigent> hey guys, I'm trying to animate between "right: 0" and "left: 100%", in each case where the other property is not set (i.e. has value "auto")
[16:52:44] <quazimodo> i assume by grabbing this build it has it all in there, yes?
[16:52:48] <atrigent> is this possible? I can't get it to work
[16:53:08] <Eviltwin> quazimodo: Maybe if you actually *read* the page
[16:53:39] <takahiro> lyrae have you ever seen this? http://api.jquery.com/animate/\
[16:53:51] <lyrae> yes but i cant use that
[16:54:15] <lyrae> its a background image i am trying to scroll in when i hover over a link
[16:54:17] <fzzbt> ooh youo can create stuff like that too
[16:54:43] <takahiro> lyrae: animate can do that
[16:55:01] <lyrae> shananigans. i tried
[16:55:06] <takahiro> lyrae: it can update the css background image property
[16:55:11] <lyrae> let me try
[16:57:25] <lyrae> docs arent clear enough. i see stuff on bg color, but not positio
[16:57:44] <lyrae> nvm i got it
[16:57:44] <Eviltwin> I believe it can animate any numeric CSS property
[16:57:53] <lyrae> thank you guys =)
[16:57:57] <takahiro> Np :)
[16:58:17] <lyrae> havent done jquery/wed dev in about a year
[16:58:19] <danheberden> though better to just eff IE and use css transitions :p
[16:58:25] <lyrae> jquery still the godfather of js frameworks?
[16:58:35] <danheberden> it'll still work, just won't be as pretty
[16:59:13] <danheberden> lyrae javascript is the dad, jquery is the hot step-mom
[16:59:36] <Eviltwin> I'd go with hot daughter
[17:00:05] <lyrae> id go with babysitter
[17:00:55] <lyrae> no but really ty again
[17:02:18] <quazimodo> Eviltwin: sorry lol, im in a stupor from doing an all nighter
[17:08:47] <fzzbt> danheberden: managed to get things working, thanks
[17:14:09] <danheberden> fzzbt awes
[17:19:18] <quazimodo> why does the downlead give me jquery-1.6.2 as well as jquery-ui-1.8.16 ?
[17:27:28] <sunscreen> hey.. if i have a bunch ofelements with id of elementid+idnumber .. can i do something like $("elemntid*").attr("name")
[17:27:37] <ivmx> hi
[17:28:19] <Jak2000> how to hidden a button in the form (immediatly a user clicked on the button)  any advice?  (i know how to disable.
[17:29:22] <ymmot> Jak2000: assign the a style to it display:hidden
[17:30:03] <Jak2000> mmmm
[17:30:13] <Jak2000> how to?
[17:30:40] <sunscreen> ahh i think i see how $('a=^elementid').bla
[17:31:26] <Jak2000> thx i need go to home i connect from my house.
[17:31:48] <sdwrage> Hey all. Is there an easy way to find a character within a div at a specific height and width in a div and cut it and the rest of the text out and replace it with a "..read more on page ???" ?
[17:32:25] <ymmot> $("#button").click(function() { $(this).css("display", "none")});
[17:33:01] <sunscreen> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [id=^delfile]
[17:33:02] <sdwrage> I have a DIV column with some P tags within. The problem arises because user data is inputed into the text replacing placeholders and the text is justified alignment
[17:33:20] <sdwrage> and I never know what the height of my column will be
[17:35:41] <sphinxxx> anyone use xchat here?
[17:36:01] <sphinxxx> the list of people in the channel has disappeared and i cant seem to get it back
[17:42:50] <Daditos> my memory might fail me but isn't $(#divname img) supposed to select all img elements inside a the proper div (with id=divname)?
[17:43:43] <Eviltwin> No
[17:43:50] <Eviltwin> but $("#divname img") is
[17:44:06] <Daditos> I'm sorry, that's what I meant
[17:44:08] <Daditos> with quotes
[17:44:29] <Daditos> ok, so I'm doing something wrong somewhere else, thanks
[17:46:19] <thebignoise> is there like a keystop() function
[17:52:34] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: Meaning what?
[17:53:04] <thebignoise> well i created an auto complete function for my input search but i have it send out the ajax request after each keyup
[17:53:15] <thebignoise> so the requests get backed up
[17:53:35] <thebignoise> i would rather just send out the request after they have stop typing
[17:59:51] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: http://jsfiddle.net/pP2Zn/1/
[18:01:19] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: oh nice! so if it its in progress it just kills the last request?
[18:01:31] <Daditos> ok, I  don't get it.  locally, I can't get the $("divname img") to work.  It works if I just use $("img") which is not what I want, of course.  but when I tried it in http://jsfiddle.net/Phebk/ it somehow works without problems.  What can I be doing wrong?  I cleared the cachÃ© just in case
[18:02:23] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: So first it waits till they haven't typed anthing for a second
[18:02:27] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: Then it starts the AJAX request
[18:02:28] <quazimodo> why does the jquery ui bundle inclue 1.6.2 if 1.7.1 is current?
[18:02:41] <Eviltwin> If they start typing while the AJAX request is still happening, the request is cancelled
[18:03:10] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: ah very clever i like! :D
[18:03:47] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure if it's clever, it's just the right way to do it.
[18:03:57] <Eviltwin> Hence why I had a fiddle for it already
[18:05:45] <Daditos> I got it
[18:05:53] <Daditos> I was using an old jquery, apparently
[18:06:21] <Daditos> is it possible that 1.4.3 didn't allow the same type of ___ descendant selector?
[18:06:40] <Daditos> "ancestor descendant", I mean
[18:07:43] <Daditos> mmm, no, the jquery site claims it was there from 1.0... I don't know what happened exactly
[18:08:22] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: its not aborting if they start typing again
[18:09:13] <Daditos> Ok, this is sad, I don't know what I was doing wrong but now it works with the old jquery  Iwas using or a newer one... I'll shut up  now...
[18:09:46] <ymmot> i am trying to call a function within source of jquery ui autocomplete example http://jsfiddle.net/tyRRq/1/
[18:10:17] <ymmot> i cant find what i am doing wrong
[18:10:53] <abstrakt> how do I add an element to the dom?
[18:11:01] <abstrakt> like how do I add an input type="text" to a div?
[18:11:11] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: It does abort
[18:11:30] <thebignoise> i copied the code exactly
[18:11:38] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: Well you can't just add an element to the DOM, you need to add it somewhere
[18:12:20] <Eviltwin> You sure it's not just responding quickly?
[18:13:16] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: i apolgize. i placed the var timer, xhr in the wrong place
[18:14:29] <Eviltwin> Figured :P
[18:21:03] <abstrakt> Eviltwin, to a div, my friend
[18:21:13] <abstrakt> Eviltwin, there's this thing called reading, maybe you do it sometimes?
[18:21:17] <Eviltwin> Just an div?
[18:21:19] <abstrakt> Eviltwin, "like how do I add an input type="text" to a div?"
[18:21:25] <abstrakt> did you not read that part ^ ?
[18:21:26] <Eviltwin> Every div?
[18:21:32] <abstrakt> a div
[18:21:33] <abstrakt> singular
[18:21:34] <Eviltwin> Okay, abstrakt, you're not getting any help from me
[18:21:36] <Eviltwin> Bye!
[18:21:49] <abstrakt> lol, dude, you're such a pedant and you're not giving any help to me anyway, you're just giving me a hard time
[18:21:57] <abstrakt> pretending like I didn't say something very clearly
[18:22:03] <abstrakt> Eviltwin, I don't need your so called "help"
[18:22:48] <ymmot> abstrakt: $(div).appendTo($("<input type='text' />"))
[18:24:11] <kborchers> ymmot: ummm, no
[18:25:19] <abstrakt> ymmot, k thanks
[18:25:32] <ymmot> yeah i know i messed that up
[18:26:12] <abstrakt> how can I remove an element, or rather, how can I have an element remove itself... specifically, how can I have a link, remove the parent div and all children (including the link itself) on click?
[18:26:19] <abstrakt> would it be this.parent().something() ?
[18:26:23] <abstrakt> this.parent().destroy() ?
[18:26:34] <abstrakt> is there a method you can call to 'self destruct' an element?
[18:26:49] <kborchers> abstrakt: the issue is if you don't provide information about that div, how can we give an example? if you assume div represents a jquery object containing some div in the dom then you could do $("<input type='text' />").appendTo(div);
[18:27:05] <kborchers> ymmot: you just had them reversed
[18:27:17] <kborchers> ?remove @ abstrakt
[18:27:18] <bot-t> abstrakt, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[18:27:18] <ymmot> my bad
[18:27:30] <abstrakt> kborchers, I assume something like $('#some_unique_id').addInputToMe(....)
[18:28:05] <kborchers> then you would do $("#id").append(input);
[18:28:21] <kborchers> ?append @ abstrakt
[18:28:21] <bot-t> abstrakt, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[18:30:11] <Opera> Hi.. I need some quick help. I have a setTimeout loop which updates some elements all the time. I use hover() to add some mouseover events to these elements and I need to do this just once, so how do I check is hover() already used for an element?
[18:31:08] <kborchers> Opera: depending on your version of jQuery you need to either see ?on
[18:31:08] <bot-t> Opera, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:31:20] <kborchers> Opera: or see ?delegate
[18:31:20] <bot-t> Opera, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[18:41:18] <Ukto> so.. I am attempting to modify a jquery plugin that re-writes tables to carry TR id's over. it has a tableToObject function that is exectued to read the table it is re-writing. http://pastebin.com/RQNjfacJ  Can anyone suggest an easy way to add each tr's id into the object array?
[18:42:04] <acidjazz> for (var i in obj) { otherobj[i] = function() { console.log(i); }; }
[18:42:09] <acidjazz> how do i keep 'i' unique
[18:42:12] <acidjazz> for each console.log
[18:42:15] <acidjazz> not just the last one
[18:42:49] <crab> what does that mean?
[18:43:04] <Eviltwin> acidjazz: Either use a $.each
[18:43:12] <crab> Ukto: just push the id onto the array in the each?
[18:43:12] <acidjazz> i want the vlaue of i passed into function()
[18:43:17] <Eviltwin> Or for(var i in obj) (function(i) { ... })(i);
[18:43:33] <Eviltwin> Where ... was the code that was in the loop
[18:45:04] <Ukto> crab: I am afraid that the objectToTable function will try to read it out as a TD... http://pastebin.com/TrZUcUZc
[18:45:08] <acidjazz> that breaks Eviltwin
[18:45:17] <acidjazz> (function(i) { })(i);
[18:45:18] <Ukto> was debating making a whole seperate objectarray
[18:45:21] <acidjazz> sure thast right?
[18:45:52] <Eviltwin> It makes a separate i for each loop
[18:46:35] <Ukto> actually.. in the tableToObject.... http://pastebin.com/RQNjfacJ  isn't it already storing the TR id ?
[18:46:55] <acidjazz> the problem w/ that Eviltwin is im not passing a function
[18:47:01] <acidjazz> oh i see
[18:47:33] <Ukto> couldnt I possibly extract objectArray[i].id ?
[18:47:43] <abstrakt> kborchers, ok and what should I use to build the input?
[18:47:50] <acidjazz> yea Eviltwin it needs to be a function i run
[18:47:53] <abstrakt> kborchers, can I just add raw HTML?
[18:48:10] <abstrakt> kborchers, well, HTML in a string that is
[18:48:27] <kborchers> abstrakt: yep .append("<input type='text' />");
[18:56:32] <Ukto> alright.. so I am using fixedheadertable plugin.  it reads a table, and re-writes it. Before it was not carrying over the TR id's. now it is. Even though there is an ID for the TR, $('#sometbale tr').click(function(){alert(this.id);});  comes back empty. wtf
[18:57:13] <Ukto> will re-writing a table cause browsers to loose access to "this" when inside of a cluck function ?
[18:58:25] <gnarf> define re-writing?
[18:58:57] <ColKurtz> can toggleClass toggle between two different classes?
[18:59:12] <Ukto> alert($(this).closest('tr').attr("id")); does not even return the id
[18:59:24] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: Yup
[18:59:30] <Eviltwin> ?toggleClass @ ColKurtz
[18:59:31] <bot-t> ColKurtz, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[18:59:43] <rogerio_dev> Hi guys
[18:59:54] <rogerio_dev> can someone say me why I am always getting error: function(response) status when submiting data by ajax POST method?
[19:00:02] <gnarf> .toggleClass("class1 class2") will switch between them
[19:00:14] <ColKurtz> ah
[19:00:18] <ColKurtz> thanks Eviltwin & gnarf
[19:00:37] <Ukto> anyone have any ideas on how to get the tr id of a re-written table?
[19:02:46] <rogerio_dev> even when the form is successfuly sended I get the jquery running the error function at the $.ajax with type: "POST"
[19:03:21] <abstrakt> how do I remove something, like $('#foo').sortable()
[19:03:25] <abstrakt> how do I make it unsortable
[19:03:28] <rogerio_dev> can someone help me?
[19:04:09] <Eviltwin> rogerio_dev: Sure
[19:04:34] <Eviltwin> rogerio_dev: What was the error?
[19:04:49] <Eviltwin> It just ran the error handler?
[19:09:59] <rogerio_dev> yes.
[19:10:34] <kborchers> abstrakt: you use sortable's destroy method see ?ui.sortable
[19:10:34] <bot-t> abstrakt, The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[19:10:43] <rogerio_dev> I was testing to send data to another page on asp.net
[19:11:11] <rogerio_dev> and on this page, insert a row on a table on a database.
[19:12:14] <Eviltwin> DId you see ?sop ?
[19:12:15] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[19:12:22] <rogerio_dev> the row is inserted without any problem, however, the $.ajax error handler is called
[19:13:57] <Eviltwin> Did you look at the status in the error landler?
[19:13:59] <Eviltwin> handler*
[19:14:00] <Eviltwin> See why?
[19:14:02] <rogerio_dev> no.. I dont saw sop
[19:14:19] <rogerio_dev> I put to display an alert message
[19:14:34] <Ukto> rogerio_dev: I have an issue with fixedheadertable that uses sortable columns. After a sort, I can't access any id's within
[19:15:13] <Ukto> in fact, after you click to sort, the whole $('#sometbale tr').click(function(){    stops functioning
[19:15:15] <rogerio_dev> And just display:[object Object]
[19:15:26] <abstrakt> how do I get the parent of the item that the event was triggered on
[19:15:40] <Ukto> .parent ?
[19:15:50] <Ukto> this.parent ?
[19:15:54] <abstrakt> Ukto, I tried, I'm getting an error when I do this.parent()
[19:16:03] <razzi> $(this).parent()
[19:16:10] <Ukto> yeah, that way
[19:16:25] <razzi> parent() is a jquery function
[19:16:34] <abstrakt> excellent :)
[19:16:43] <abstrakt> yeah I understand now, thanks
[19:16:57] <Ukto> razzi: any idea why my jquery .click() ceases to work after table is sorted? and how I can work around it?
[19:17:11] <vsmith> abstrakt: are you from houston?
[19:17:20] <razzi> ukto you have url ?
[19:17:30] <Ukto> lemme toss one up
[19:21:16] <logictrap> I'm using jqm theme roller, but it seems to be missing styles for toolbars. Am I doing something wrong?
[19:24:30] <rogerio_dev> I was reading at SOP definition and believe that this is not my problem
[19:24:52] <rogerio_dev> cause both pages I am sending data are on same domain
[19:24:55] <abstrakt> vsmith, I'm from the US, other than that, i'm not willing to share much
[19:24:57] <rogerio_dev> on localhost
[19:25:44] <Ukto> razzi: mind if I pm the url to you?
[19:25:56] <razzi> no
[19:31:23] <rogerio_dev> hey guys, do u know If have some problem with the $.ajax work with dataType as "text/plain"?
[19:31:33] <rogerio_dev> cause I changed it to simple: "text"
[19:31:38] <rogerio_dev> and It`s working now
[19:34:26] <kborchers> rogerio_dev: if you look at the docs, there are certain valid dataType options which are xml, html, script, json, jsonp, text or a space separated list of those options see ?ajax
[19:34:26] <bot-t> rogerio_dev, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[19:36:51] <rogerio_dev> ahh.. I was following a tutorial witch uses jQuery 1.4
[19:37:04] <rogerio_dev> *1.4.2
[19:39:22] <ed1t_> is anyone using data tables with twitter bootstrap? I'm having problems integrating those 2
[19:40:17] <mdel> ed1t_: what kind of problems?
[19:41:03] <ed1t_> mdel: dataTables doesn't work at all....the fields show up but its not rendered right and it doesn't filter table at all
[19:42:18] <mdel> ed1t_: well, it sounds like the markup is incorrect
[19:42:31] <mdel> unless you are trying to use the js features of bootstrap on the table at the same time
[19:43:14] <ed1t_> i don't think there are any js features for tables in bootstrap
[19:43:24] <ed1t_> even if there were....im not using them
[19:45:33] <sankage> ed1t_: if you remove the bootstrap css does the data table work?
[19:46:29] <rogerio_dev> when I use $("#some_form_id").serialize(), what is the better dataType to use: text, html? or any other?
[19:46:50] <rogerio_dev> *dataType to $.ajax POST
[19:46:56] <Eviltwin> It's a URL-encoded string
[19:47:41] <kborchers> rogerio_dev: the dataType option in $.ajax tells ajax what to expect back, not what you are sending
[19:48:07] <Eviltwin> What you are sending is contentType
[19:49:36] <mdel> ed1t_: there is integration with tablesort.js
[19:50:01] <mdel> Tablesorter Plugin as it's called
[19:50:09] <ed1t_> what I really want is filtering of the table? can I do the filter easily using jQuery ?
[19:50:13] <rogerio_dev> hum.. Thnx so much
[19:50:27] <mdel> ed1t_: again, I suspect you have an error somewhere
[19:50:33] <mdel> it should *just work*
[19:51:34] <mdel> if dataTables is messing with the markup or applying its own styles, I would make sure that's not causing conflicts
[19:54:33] <rogerio_dev> I finally got this: alert("Té q em fim"); running. wich means (the message): "yeah finally"
[19:54:44] <rogerio_dev> thnx everbody
[19:55:41] <ed1t_> mdel: is it easy to filter the table data myself? I kind of like the bootstrap styling
[19:55:47] <ed1t_> do u have any tutorials to implement it?
[19:56:59] <sankage> ed1t_: you can have both, you just need to find the part that is causing issues
[19:57:13] <OWEN_> Hello friends! Please check out my fiddle and open your console to see the logs and click the red and blue boxes!
[19:57:15] <OWEN_> http://jsfiddle.net/timmyo/PBEMy/1/
[19:57:26] <ed1t_> sankage: with dataTables it apples its own style to the table
[19:58:05] <OWEN_> you will notice initial clicks do not work on the boxes!
[19:58:49] <sankage> ed1t_: so which part isn't working, data tables, or bootstrap?
[19:59:31] <ed1t_> bootstrap works fine....dataTables doesn't work but now I think about it more....i don't wanna use data tables coz then i will lose my bootstrap styling
[19:59:38] <ed1t_> so I just want to implement mysrlf
[19:59:42] <ed1t_> myself
[19:59:54] <mdel> ed1t_: i mean, just look at their code
[20:00:00] <mdel> you have an example right in front of you
[20:00:36] <ed1t_> their code is 7000 lines
[20:00:37] <mdel> you might be able to use some of it even
[20:00:48] <sankage> ed1t_: ok, so if you were to just turn "off" bootstrap, do the data tables work?
[20:00:48] <mdel> ed1t_: well, that should tell you something :)
[20:00:51] <OWEN_> Hello please check my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/timmyo/PBEMy/1/ and open your browser console and test the red and blue boxes. You will notice the first clicks are not working.
[20:02:17] <timholum> Does anyone know of any librarys that would make it easy to do google doc style colabaration on a textarea?
[20:03:13] <mdel> OWEN_: you have a bigger issue... the up/down is always 1 behind
[20:03:27] <mdel> click up three times, then notice the value on the forth click
[20:03:36] <mdel> it will increment instead of decrement
[20:04:24] <mdel> OWEN_: also, you are defining the plugin within document.ready, but you are using it OUTSIDE
[20:04:47] <OWEN_> mdel - in my code it's outside ready
[20:04:53] <OWEN_> how do i msg personally
[20:05:01] <sankage> OWEN_: looks like your selector context is wrong, "this" happens outside the quotes: $('.down', this);
[20:05:20] <OWEN_> oh no sh*t
[20:05:56] <mdel> nice catch
[20:06:28] <OWEN_> ok i fixed the objects still same problem
[20:06:33] <sankage> i have no idea if that is the cause of the problem, but I am sure it would be at some point
[20:07:28] <OWEN_> but yes first click logs in the console but does nothing in the text field
[20:07:48] <OWEN_> also after you've clicked up a few times and try to click down it still increments one before decrementing and vice versa
[20:08:41] <mdel> OWEN_: you aren't defining the plugin to operate on a set of matched elements
[20:08:52] <mdel> you should be returning $(this).each()
[20:09:12] <mdel> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[20:09:15] <sankage> OWEN_: you are using ++ and --
[20:10:10] <sankage> change that to += 1
[20:10:19] <sankage> and -= 1
[20:10:57] <mdel> ???
[20:11:07] <sankage> ++ and -- don't change the value until after you set the value
[20:11:25] <various_artists2> Could anyone help me understand why when I loop through json using $.each it loops through every character rather than the keys and values?
[20:11:31] <mdel> ah yes... always define vars before using them
[20:11:36] <mdel> avoids this problem
[20:12:18] <mdel> various_artists2: can you pastie the source json?
[20:12:23] <OWEN_> wow both of your suggestions worked - thanks
[20:13:00] <sankage> OWEN_: ++ and -- are 2 of the bad parts of Javascript as explained by Douglas Crockford
[20:13:25] <sankage> they can do not what you would think, just like this case
[20:13:42] <OWEN_> sankage: yeah i don't get it but whatever works. also which variable are you talking about that i need to define before using it
[20:14:13] <mdel> OWEN_: i was saying that you could also have defined your variables first
[20:14:14] <sankage> OWEN_: nothing needs to be defined, mdel just mispoke
[20:14:24] <mdel> sankage: i didnt
[20:14:39] <sankage> options.value is already defined sir
[20:15:07] <sankage> he was just trying to increment them
[20:15:12] <various_artists2> mdel here is the json response http://pastebin.com/NQZx77AV I am using a normal each.
[20:15:17] <various_artists2> thanks
[20:15:37] <mdel> yeah I see that, i stopped referencing the code at some point
[20:15:42] <mdel> apologies
[20:15:46] <various_artists2> I have tried changing the each a lot so I think it could be the response
[20:15:49] <Eviltwin> I wonder if this is getting too big for a jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/99hrw/16/
[20:16:18] <sankage> mdel: np, i realize what you meant, just knew it wasn't the case
[20:17:41] <mdel> various_artists2: do you have the dataType set in the ajax call?
[20:17:46] <mdel> dataType: 'json'
[20:18:12] <various_artists2> no good point thanks, i'll give it a go.
[20:18:40] <mdel> np
[20:19:37] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, is that your orbit model?
[20:21:20] <Eviltwin> I was helping a friend work out some physics logic for
[20:21:24] <Eviltwin> something he was building
[20:21:31] <Eviltwin> And I wanted to illustrate the vectors for his thing
[20:21:40] <Eviltwin> Then decided I could make it into a fun little gravity simulation
[20:21:47] <Eviltwin> So I did
[20:21:58] <Whirl3d> it's nice
[20:22:03] <Eviltwin> I like it
[20:22:08] <sdwrage> Hey guys. I have text that I need cut off at an exact height. The text is in paragraphs enclosed in a div called "column" (think newspaper). I need to find any text located at a specific height and cut from there onward. Is there a good solution for this?
[20:22:16] <Whirl3d> that sounded sarcastic, but I meant it in earnest
[20:22:17] <sdwrage> racking my brain attempting to figure this out
[20:22:23] <sdwrage> also, the text is justified
[20:22:32] <sdwrage> so I can't just count the text and cut :\
[20:22:54] <sankage> sdwrage: overflow:hidden?
[20:23:03] <Whirl3d> There's a plugin for that. I don't know the name, but I found it on google.
[20:23:29] <sdwrage> sankage, problem with that is some text ends up getting cut off a bit.
[20:23:51] <sdwrage> meaning half text
[20:23:53] <Whirl3d> is all the text the same font/height/etc?
[20:23:59] <sdwrage> yeah,
[20:24:07] <various_artists2> mdel Thanks for the help that worked!
[20:24:18] <abjorn> imsky: Skyward Sword has the most Link/Zelda sexual tension of any game in the series to date.
[20:24:22] <mdel> various_artists2: awesome
[20:24:24] <Whirl3d> cause then you could calculate whole number multiples of the line height and divide the column height by it, round and reapply column height.
[20:24:31] <mdel> omg skyward sword
[20:24:33] <mdel> <3
[20:24:37] <imsky> abjorn: if only i ever played those games
[20:25:00] <abjorn> well
[20:25:01] <abjorn> you should
[20:25:01] <sankage> <- stopped zelda after ocarina of time
[20:25:20] <mdel> sankage: start again! skyward sword is my first zelda game since OoT
[20:25:26] <mdel> its the same feeling. im just an adult now.
[20:25:46] <abjorn> why would you stop after OOT? :( MM, WW, and TP awesome games :(
[20:26:11] <mdel> abjorn: not enough time, stopped playing games for a long time
[20:26:28] <sankage> had to spend the time learning javascript...
[20:26:30] <sankage> :P
[20:26:31] <mdel> i plan on going back and playing at least MM
[20:26:43] <Whirl3d> $(".col").height(function () { var h=$(".col").height(); var h/=lineheight; h=Math.floor(h); h=h*lineheight; return h;});  --could be done much more succinctly, but that's the idea.
[20:27:53] <abjorn> so imsky
[20:27:59] <imsky> so abjorn
[20:28:04] <abjorn> my supervisor at work got promoted...well, idk about promoted, but moved to
[20:28:08] <abjorn> head javascript developer
[20:28:14] <abjorn> what are the fuckin chances huh
[20:28:21] <imsky> man
[20:28:24] <Jason> Hello
[20:28:29] <imsky> you should make him dependent on you
[20:28:37] <abjorn> he says im the first person he'll contact once theres a position open
[20:28:41] <imsky> ^
[20:28:43] <imsky> jackpot
[20:28:48] <abjorn> but
[20:28:48] <Guest29278> I am known as guest?
[20:28:51] <abjorn> i dont have my hopes up
[20:28:51] <Guest29278> lol
[20:28:57] <abstrakt> is there a way to "namespace" all my calls
[20:29:13] <abjorn> it's weird, because I know javascript more in depth, and he literally learned it in the two weeks before he got the position
[20:29:16] <Whirl3d> bind/trigger
[20:29:21] <abjorn> that's not to say he's a nub, he's a good coder
[20:29:27] <abstrakt> so instead of repeating $('#foo .bar').method(); $('#foo .bar').othermethod(); $('#foo .bar').anothermethod()
[20:29:29] <Eviltwin> I kinda suspect he's a nub
[20:29:30] <abstrakt> I can just do, i.e.
[20:29:32] <Guest29278> why does .unload() not work on chrome?
[20:29:46] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: Learn about chaining
[20:29:50] <abstrakt> $('#foo').childselector(...
[20:30:04] <abstrakt> ok
[20:30:08] <crankharder> can anyone make this work:  the idea is to tab down the inputs, not the links: http://jsfiddle.net/jWRWn/
[20:30:33] <abstrakt> ok, well I understand what chaining is
[20:30:47] <abstrakt> how does chaining help here?
[20:31:02] <abjorn> imsky: He spent two weeks reading two o'reily books on JS top to bottom. I spent two years reading and watching everything under the sun.
[20:31:06] <Eviltwin> colint_: http://jsfiddle.net/jWRWn/1/
[20:31:10] <Eviltwin> Err
[20:31:12] <Eviltwin> crankharder: http://jsfiddle.net/jWRWn/1/
[20:31:13] <abstrakt> I want something similar to say, C# or VB where you can do .with SomeObject\n.someproperty = blah
[20:31:15] <imsky> abjorn: i barely learn anything from oreilly books
[20:31:20] <imsky> tech books are written kinda poorly
[20:31:24] <Whirl3d> crankharder, try setting tabindex=0 on the links, and it should skip them
[20:31:35] <sankage> abstrakt: $('#foo .bar').method(); $('#foo .bar').othermethod(); $('#foo .bar').anothermethod() becomes $('#foo .bar').method().othermethod().anothermethod()
[20:31:39] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: You showed $('#foo .bar').method(); $('#foo .bar').othermethod(); $('#foo .bar').anothermethod()
[20:31:41] <abjorn> The only one I've liked is The Good Parts, and that's cause it's pretty straight forward and to the point
[20:31:45] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: That can be done as $('#foo .bar').method().othermethod().anothermethod()
[20:31:46] <abjorn> (aka short)
[20:31:57] <Guest29278> Eviltwin did you tell me to learn about chainging for my problem.  (why does .unload() not work on chrome?)
[20:32:01] <Eviltwin> Well JavaScript does have with()
[20:32:05] <abstrakt> ahh, sorry ok well I misspoke in my example
[20:32:06] <abjorn> ^ but dont use it
[20:32:11] <Eviltwin> But people will hurt you if you use it
[20:32:15] <abjorn> like me
[20:32:16] <abjorn> and imsky
[20:32:18] <abstrakt> I mean more like this...
[20:32:19] <Eviltwin> And me
[20:32:23] <abjorn> yeah and him
[20:32:37] <abstrakt> $('#foo .bar').method(); $('#foo .baz').othermethod(); $('#foo .qux').anothermethod() becomes $('#foo .narp').method()
[20:33:06] <Eviltwin> So make one method that does those three?
[20:33:26] <imsky> abjorn: i like good parts too, but if you've seen a crockford talk, you've read it
[20:33:29] <Eviltwin> I think you should see ? .find
[20:33:29] <abstrakt> so can I turn that in to something like $('#foo').as_namespace({ $('.bar').method(); $('.baz').method() })
[20:33:34] <sankage> $('#foo').find('.bar').method().end().find(...
[20:33:55] <abstrakt> but it's different methods each time, i'm just looking for a slight shorthand syntax, but it's not that big of a deal
[20:33:57] <Guest29278> why does this code not work.  $(window).unload(function() { alert('hi'); }); in chrome?
[20:34:09] <abjorn> imsky: oh well yeah for sure
[20:34:15] <abjorn> I read the book before watching any of his talks, though
[20:34:34] <letterpress> in $.bbq.removestate() i see the comment: Setting an empty state may cause the browser to scroll.
[20:34:39] <letterpress> which is true. any way around this?
[20:34:40] <imsky> abjorn: i pretty much regularly collect tech books. talks are faster
[20:34:41] <abjorn> I watched that 5 part video series from him at that yahoo conference...after the first once, which was just history, I kinda tuned out, cause I'd heard it all before
[20:34:54] <imsky> yeah i was into javascript before it was cool
[20:35:11] <abstrakt> ahh, yes I see, .find() looks interesting thanks Eviltwin
[20:35:12] <sankage> abstrakt: you could define contexts, var parent = $('#foo'), child = $('.bar', parent)
[20:35:14] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: It's ugly but you could do: var foo = $("#foo"); and then foo.find(".bar").method()
[20:35:16] * imsky puts on wool cap, ironic glasses, and scarf
[20:35:28] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: See? Sometimes the answer *is* in the docs :P
[20:35:36] <abjorn> lol imsky
[20:35:40] <abjorn> so you were into it in 1999?
[20:35:53] <imsky> dammit you ruined my hipster joke. but yeah actually
[20:35:57] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: $("#foo").find(".bar") has the same outcome as $("#foo .bar")
[20:36:01] <abstrakt> Eviltwin, of course it is, but sometimes it is faster and more reliable to ask human language to humans than it is to query machines with computer language
[20:36:03] <yogurt_truck> imsky: you forgot the ironic t-shirt
[20:36:10] <abstrakt> Eviltwin, I can read docs, if I know which docs to read
[20:36:11] <imsky> back then DHTML was the hot shit, abjorn
[20:36:17] <imsky> yogurt_truck: i guess i did my yogurt friend
[20:36:27] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: Part of the reason we generally steer people towards docs is because the jQuery docs are particularly thorough
[20:36:34] <abstrakt> ok I think i'll use find
[20:36:41] <Eviltwin> And usually include several detailed examples
[20:36:48] * yogurt_truck turns into ice cream for a bit
[20:36:50] <Eviltwin> Not to mention every possible different syntax
[20:36:51] <abstrakt> yes I read them
[20:37:09] <winux> How do I go about sliding up a div to display, and sliding down to hide? the slide functions jquery provides are doing the opposite in my testing
[20:37:11] <imsky> i remember netscape navigator 4 fondly
[20:37:15] <Eviltwin> And conveniently, they're usually named about whaty you'd expect them to be
[20:37:18] <imsky> press escape and all the gifs stop omagawd
[20:37:48] <drakenlord> Hi
[20:37:50] <yogurt_truck> i have fond memories of FF 3.6
[20:37:55] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: If you're using a particular context a lot, there's one trick you could use to shorten it but it's particularly ugly
[20:37:55] <abjorn> well, he knows how much I want a dev position, so who knows
[20:37:57] <yogurt_truck> those were the times
[20:38:11] <imsky> lol
[20:38:21] <imsky> yeah, those ancient days of a year ago
[20:38:37] <winux> yogurt_truck: 3.6 is my primary browser on one machine :)
[20:38:42] <letterpress> in other wordsâ€¦. Is there anyway keep the browser from jumping when I use $.removeState() to remove all states from the fragment?
[20:38:49] <radiantstatic> So I've written up this little query panel - http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/tD7dQ/60/ and I'm looking to implement it into my page http://radiantstatic.com/build/ - what do i need to do to ensure no issues?
[20:39:02] <yogurt_truck> winux: :>
[20:39:12] <imsky> abjorn: have you asked for a bromotion?
[20:39:15] <letterpress> i mean $.bbq.removeState()
[20:39:57] <abjorn> Yeah, I've tried several times to get a dev position
[20:40:21] <abjorn> the first time they weren't hiring, the second time it was some php/perl shit i wasn't gonna be able to (or want to) do
[20:40:38] <abjorn> the third time I interviewed and everything, and some shmuck who isn't nearly as capable as me got it
[20:40:51] <winux> abjorn: for what company?
[20:40:56] <abjorn> HostGator
[20:40:59] <winux> ah
[20:41:19] <winux> abjorn: how did he get it?
[20:41:19] <abjorn> Fourth time it ended up being something far different from what I was expecting that is for a project I can't talk about. Suffice to say, it can't really even be called developing imo, so I turned it down.
[20:41:36] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: It's pretty ugly but if you're using the context *A LOT*: http://jsfiddle.net/vmAwL/
[20:41:53] <imsky> abjorn: just talk to that recently promoted dev
[20:41:59] <abjorn> He's been at the company for like two years and has done some coding things around the office, mostly scripts to make our jobs easier
[20:42:02] <imsky> he's gonna have some oh shit moments
[20:42:42] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: It's a little misleading cause c(...) basically runs context.find(...)
[20:42:51] <Eviltwin> While it looks a lot like $(...)
[20:43:15] <abjorn> imsky: funny way I found out they filled that position I applied for. I was working, get a customer in chat, turned out to be the dev that took the position I wanted, in chat testing something
[20:43:24] <imsky> loool
[20:43:34] <imsky> welcome to corporations ma wiggla
[20:43:37] <abjorn> this story ends with me telling him what was wrong with the js code >.>
[20:43:49] <sankage> Eviltwin: could he not simply do this: var c = $('#foo'), $('.xxx',c)?
[20:44:10] <winux> radiantstatic: im a bit puzzled by your question
[20:44:21] <imsky> abjorn: do you need the tech support job?
[20:44:24] <Eviltwin> sankage: That works too but this is shorter :P
[20:44:26] <imsky> i mean you do live in goddamn austin
[20:45:11] <abjorn> it's harder than you'd think brah
[20:45:36] <imsky> orly
[20:45:46] <imsky> my town doesn't have TXJS and SXSW conferences
[20:45:54] <imsky> harder than i think you say
[20:46:00] <sankage> lol
[20:46:16] <abjorn> SHADDAP
[20:46:45] <imsky> abjorn: if you don't really need the job, just go to the boss man and demand a promotion. it's a waste of time for you to be doing tech support if you want to do dev instead
[20:46:55] <Eviltwin> I think it'd be interesting if jQuery supported a var c = $("...").chroot(); or whatever where it binds c to that selector
[20:47:53] <yogurt_truck> abjorn: just create a startup and make funky shit and webapps and shit and people will be like omg and then get rich and famous, somehow
[20:48:06] <abjorn> If only they'd fire the incompetent fucking devs that are in our houston office, id get it no problem
[20:48:06] <imsky> that's what yogurt_truck did
[20:48:07] <yogurt_truck> that's my specific theoretical model for business success
[20:48:10] <abjorn> lol
[20:48:19] <imsky> abjorn: dude how old are you seriously
[20:48:22] <winux> yogurt_truck: agreed
[20:48:35] <abjorn> 12
[20:48:36] <imsky> companies are horrible at filtering out incompetent but socially apt people
[20:48:37] <abjorn> 12 years old
[20:48:41] <winux> lol
[20:48:42] <abjorn> yeah i know
[20:48:59] <imsky> so just deal with it, go to the boss and ask for a promotion directly
[20:49:09] <winux> imsky: interesting comment
[20:49:10] <imsky> what's the worst that could happen? you could do tech support at another web host
[20:49:18] <abjorn> they've been doing some cleaning house lately tho, which is cool. They're about to clean up some of our incompetent fucking Internal Support people :D
[20:49:27] <imsky> internal affairs :o
[20:49:31] <abjorn> ya
[20:50:02] <imsky> well don't hitch your hopes of a position onto that wagon
[20:50:26] <abjorn> Internal Support is my Plan B. Pays better than dev anyways
[20:50:44] <imsky> yeah but come on, you're scheming and plotting inside of _hostgator_
[20:50:49] <abjorn> lol
[20:50:49] <imsky> it's not ibm..
[20:50:56] <abjorn> scheming and plotting
[20:50:57] <abjorn> more like
[20:50:59] <abjorn> complaining and hoping
[20:51:12] <imsky> why not just ask top management
[20:51:23] <imsky> shit he probably just plays COD all day and wants to talk to people anyway
[20:51:31] <abjorn> nah
[20:51:32] <abjorn> well
[20:51:33] <abjorn> sort of
[20:51:44] <abjorn> donny plays battlefield
[20:51:46] <abjorn> :3
[20:51:48] <imsky> lol also good
[20:51:58] <imsky> look, don't depend on HR to put you through
[20:52:02] <yogurt_truck> oh i should go play more games
[20:52:05] <yogurt_truck> bbl
[20:52:06] <abjorn> psh, HR doesn't help this kind of thing
[20:52:08] <imsky> bai yogurt_truck
[20:52:11] <abjorn> I don't even talk to HR
[20:52:14] <abjorn> except for
[20:52:15] <imsky> abjorn: then what are you hoping for
[20:52:17] <abjorn> "whats for lunch?"
[20:52:24] <imsky> that some bro loses his job and you get it?
[20:53:41] <ragas> how do i refer to the second item in a list?  eg. <li:second> , but something that actually works.
[20:54:20] <Eviltwin> ragas: :eq(1)
[20:55:04] <ragas> thanks twin
[20:55:59] <winux> does anyone know a way to 'slide up' an element (like a colored div) using a jquery function (such as animate) for a progressive display effect? im only having luck getting elements to display when sliding down
[21:09:22] <torm3nt> hey everyone
[21:09:32] <torm3nt> was wondering if anyone could give me some guidance on extending jquery for ajax responses?\
[21:09:49] <torm3nt> I want a standard way to handle all responses, based on whether or not the request was a json request, and whether certain data is available or not.
[21:11:49] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to implement this sliding panel in my page. Here's the panel: http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/tD7dQ/60/ - here's my website: http://radiantstatic.com/build/ . What precautions do I need to take?
[21:17:37] <ngharo> wear a rubber dood
[21:19:31] <torm3nt> how do I bind to ajaxComplete without using an element as the basis for the handler?
[21:19:50] <torm3nt> I need to do something like: $.ajaxComplete(function() { alert('request complete!'); });
[21:19:52] <torm3nt> .etc
[21:21:27] <torm3nt> 819 people in the room and noone knows how to do this?
[21:21:35] <JesperA> not without my anus
[21:22:08] <ngharo> torm3nt: you can call it on any element, it'll execute no matter what
[21:22:21] <torm3nt> I don't want it attached to an element, that's the thing
[21:22:32] <winux> interesting
[21:22:41] <torm3nt> it makes no logical sense to do so
[21:23:00] <ngharo> its usually used for logging, or in ajaxError case, outputting the error
[21:24:12] <torm3nt> *nod*
[21:24:41] <Cork> torm3nt: just attach the event listner to body or similar, as its using the event mechanism, it needs an element
[21:24:43] <torm3nt> that's what I'm looking for - about 90% of the requests on this app are json, done via jquery.  I need to hook into the completion/error aspects and then show notifications at times when certain sets of data are available.
[21:24:49] <torm3nt> Cork - yeah I've just done that
[21:25:11] <Cork> alternativly you can use .ajaxSetup to set a default complete handler
[21:25:26] <Cork> won't do exactly the same thing though
[21:26:28] <torm3nt> bah
[21:26:31] <torm3nt> sorry did I miss anything?
[21:26:45] <Cork> heh ya
[21:26:48] <Cork> "alternativly you can use .ajaxSetup to set a default complete handler"
[21:26:56] <torm3nt> ahhh
[21:26:57] <Cork> "won't do exactly the same thing though"
[21:27:41] <torm3nt> yeah I think the ajaxComplete/ajaxError is a better approach
[21:40:02] <torm3nt> swoit, sorted it out :D
[21:50:22] <Guest20172> has anyone here ever used the modal popup called boxy?
[21:50:59] <Guest20172> I am having a problem returning data to the jquery $.post function
[21:51:46] <Guest20172> here is what my post looks like:
[21:51:47] <Guest20172>                     $.post('/prospects', { firstname: c.find("input[name='firstname']").val(), lastnamename: c.find("input[name='lastname']").val(), email: c.find("input[name='email']").val(), phone: c.find("input[name='phone']").val(),company: c.find("input[name='company']").val(),title: c.find("input[name='title']").val(), comment: c.find("#comment").val()},
[21:51:49] <Guest20172>                     function(data){
[21:51:50] <Guest20172>                         /*set boxy content to data from ajax call back*/
[21:51:52] <Guest20172>                         alert(data);
[21:51:53] <Guest20172>                         contactBoxy.setContent("<div style=\"width: 300px; height: 300px\">"+data+"</div>");
[21:51:55] <Guest20172>                     });
[21:51:57] <Guest20172> sry about the code dump
[21:52:05] <Cork> ?p @ Guest20172
[21:52:06] <bot-t> Guest20172, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:52:43] <Cork> code dups in the channel is often almost unreadable
[21:55:54] <toybits> sadsdasda
[22:04:19] <Guest20172> Core:  I can't get it to work properly in jsfiddle, but here is a gist of my code:  any help would be greatly appreciated:  https://gist.github.com/1436960
[22:05:24] <Guest20172>  Cork:  I can't get it to work properly in jsfiddle, but here is a gist of my code:  any help would be greatly appreciated:  https://gist.github.com/1436960
[22:06:51] <Cork> Guest20172: why don't you just use serialize?
[22:07:00] <Cork> ?.serialized @ Guest20172
[22:07:01] <bot-t> Guest20172, .serialize() - Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[22:10:22] <Guest20172> Cork:  tnk, I will take a look at that, but the problem isn't with the submission, but rather with the response
[22:10:30] <Guest20172> *tnx
[22:14:01] <Guest20172> Cork:  in my response js page, if I do 'response text', it displays 'response text with the 's included.  How do I properly need to return the data from a post request?
[22:14:55] <Cork> Guest20172: as raw text
[22:15:20] <Cork> you don't need any string capsuling
[22:15:49] <Guest20172> Cork:  if I don't throw in the '', nothing appears
[22:16:12] <Cork> Guest20172: throw them in where?
[22:16:51] <Guest20172> in my .js response page
[22:17:03] <Guest20172> Cork:  in my js response page
[22:17:16] <Cork> you'r not responding with js
[22:17:18] <Cork> just text
[22:20:42] <Guest20172> Cork:  I'm using ROR and I have to tell it to respond with JS, if I put 'Your information has been recieved.  We will contact you.', it works, but if I remove the ''s, it prints/displays nothing
[22:21:22] <Cork> Guest20172: you should use another view type
[22:21:51] <Cork> Guest20172: ex. .html or .json
[22:25:00] <woozly> guys, how to disable css hover for element?
[22:25:50] <woozly> I have some <div id="button"/> with css: #button:hover { background-position: 0 -122px; } (but I need to disable it, when I need)
[22:27:35] <ngharo> use classes
[22:27:39] <coldhead> #button.disabled:hover {background-position:shutup-whatever} then $('#button').toggleClass('disabled') or words to that effect
[22:28:17] <woozly> okay thanks guys!
[22:28:43] <Cork> you can also to it through inline css
[22:28:55] <Cork> though classes are cleaner in most cases
[22:30:05] <Cork> woozly: btw if your going the class way i would actually recoment #button:not(disabled):hover
[22:30:37] <coldhead> you're*
[22:30:44] <Cork> *recomend :)
[22:32:36] <coldhead> recommend** :D
[22:32:44] <coldhead> ah spelink is four chumps
[22:33:14] <Cork> lol
[22:37:58] <Whirl3d> Could someone point me to a decent escape character chart for javascript and RegExp? I can't seem to find two articles that don't conflict.
[22:43:07] <tocsick> hey, how do i assign the current <li> that is being hovered over as a variable to then append to a toggleclass?
[22:43:19] <Guest20172> Cork:  how can I remove the quotes js displays from a json response
[22:43:44] <Cork> Guest20172: you would have to treat the response as json
[22:44:14] <radiantstatic> Any tips on how I can implement my sliding panel: http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/tD7dQ/60/ into my page http://radiantstatic.com/build - I want to take the necessary precautions before putting it in the page.
[22:44:15] <Guest20172> cork:  a little more explanation, please
[22:44:22] <Cork> $.ajax({ url:'', data:{}, dataType:'json', success:function(json) {} });
[22:44:37] <coldhead> Whirl3d: you should be able to get by with just a decent chart of regex special chars, and escape any you need escaped. like https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[22:44:45] <Guest20172> cork:  tnx
[22:45:12] <tocsick> http://jsfiddle.net/Qsg6e/1/ I'm trying to get a parent div to change background based on what child is hovered over
[22:45:26] <Cork> Guest20172: but you need to make sure you return json if you do
[22:45:38] <Cork> Guest20172: else the response won't parse
[22:45:55] <Cork> render :json => @my_data
[22:46:39] <tocsick> so i need it to be toggleClass('hoverX'), where X is the li that is being hovered over currently
[22:47:03] <Cork> tocsick: why??
[22:47:21] <Cork> that sounds like you'r overcomplicating the css
[22:47:41] <tocsick> unreasonable request from a client :)
[22:47:53] <tocsick> lol
[22:48:05] <Cork> why don't you just add a hover class to the hovered li?
[22:48:35] <tocsick> on a wordpress site, with wp_nav_menu, there's a banner image that needs to change based upon which menu item is hovered on a horizontal nav below the banner
[22:49:10] <Cork> ah
[22:49:13] <tocsick> so changing the li doesn't allow the image above to be changed
[22:49:13] <tocsick> yeah
[22:49:27] <Cork> you prob don't want toggltClass though
[22:50:04] <tocsick> i need to change the class of a parent or append a class to a parent that allows the background image to show up when hovered, then show a default background image when they aren't hovered
[22:50:13] <Cork> i would prob go as bar as attr('class', '<other classes> hover' + this.index());
[22:50:37] <Cork> and use delegate to catch hover on all li's
[22:50:57] <tocsick> i'm sorry, i'm a total jquery noob - but i know jquery is the best answer here
[22:51:16] <tocsick> so i don't know how to implement what you jsut said
[22:51:41] <megatrond> Cork: why not addClass()?
[22:52:08] <Cork> megatrond: cause then you would have a full list of all hoverX classes and run removeClass on them
[22:52:35] <Cork> else you would end up with all hover classes on the symbolizer
[22:52:47] <Cork> tocsick: how much can you do about the menu html?
[22:52:47] <tocsick> I need a find way to just take whatever li I'm hovering over and then append it's class to it's parent div
[22:52:57] <megatrond> or just remove the hover class on mouseleave?
[22:53:11] <Cork> megatrond: that will fail at some point
[22:53:15] <Cork> always
[22:53:36] <tocsick> it's strictly ul li a. i can add classes to the li, but i need to add a class to the parent div of the ul
[22:53:58] <sneak_> hi, how do i get the nth item in a selector, e.g. 'html > body > table > tr')[2]
[22:53:59] <Cork> tocsick: can you add extra attributes to the li/a's?
[22:54:00] <sneak_> but in the selector
[22:54:03] <tocsick> so i need to somehow use jquery to grab the class from li and append it to div
[22:54:09] <sneak_> so i can do further child selections with >
[22:54:15] <Cork> tocsick: i would prob see that as a simpler solution
[22:54:30] <Eviltwin> sneak_: :eq(2)
[22:54:56] <tocsick> cork well, it still needs to dynamically change whatever class the parent div is based on what li is being hovered over - would that do it?
[22:55:05] <Cork> no
[22:55:17] <Cork> i mean you could set the images from the info in the attribute on the li
[22:55:30] <Cork> then you don't need hundreds of classes
[22:55:57] <sneak_> Eviltwin: thx
[22:56:38] <tocsick> it's only what li is being hovered within a specific ul
[22:56:41] <tocsick> http://jsfiddle.net/Qsg6e/3/
[22:56:52] <Cork> $('#menu').delegate('li', 'hover', function() { $('#image').attr('src', $(this).attr('data-image')); }).mouseout(function() {$('#image').removeAttr('src'); });
[22:57:01] <Cork> that should do about what i mean
[22:57:31] <Cork> and you wouldn't need any extra css at all
[22:57:54] <Cork> opps
[22:57:58] <Cork> typo
[22:58:30] <Cork> $('#menu').delegate('li', 'hover', function() { $('#image').attr('src', $(this).data('image')); }).mouseout(function() {$('#image').removeAttr('src'); });
[22:59:36] <tocsick> so what does that do? sorry i don't understand
[22:59:59] <sneak_> ok last question
[23:00:28] <Cork> tocsick: #image is an <img> tag, it holds the image you want to show
[23:00:29] <sneak_> when i am in a script and i have loaded jquery, i am getting a no such variable '$', is there a way to access jquery from the window object?
[23:00:51] <Cork> tocsick: you add data-image="<full url for the image to show>" to the li elements
[23:01:21] <Cork> tocsick: that code should then on li hover set the src of the <img> to the data-image attribute
[23:01:31] <tocsick> that's the problem is in wordpress there's no way to add an image within the new wordpress menu, but i modified a plugin that now makes it possible
[23:01:36] <Cork> tocsick: and when you mouse out from the menu remove it
[23:01:57] <Cork> tocsick: you can set a background image or what ever you like
[23:02:03] <Cork> that was just an example :)
[23:02:27] <tocsick> right, but the images are going to change frequently from client uploading etc
[23:02:38] <tocsick> so i would have to change the jquery source then?
[23:02:46] <Cork> nope
[23:03:00] <Cork> it looks in the <li data-image="">
[23:03:10] <tocsick> i can't add any attributes to the lis, except for css class
[23:03:11] <Cork> so all you would have to do is put the correct image there
[23:03:20] <Cork> ouch
[23:03:22] <tocsick> yeah
[23:03:27] * Cork hats wp even more...
[23:03:35] <tocsick> me too
[23:03:52] <tocsick> so the way i'm trying to do it here is really the only thing i can figure out to do
[23:03:52] <Cork> ok, back to example one then, give me a min and i'll modify your pb
[23:04:17] <megatrond> tocsick: do you have access to the php code?
[23:04:32] <Cork> don't need it
[23:04:34] <tocsick> i had something with just css/xhtml, but it required placing an <img> within the <a></a>
[23:04:50] <tocsick> and wordpress just can't do it - it don't have the power
[23:05:12] <tocsick> megatrond, yes i have the php
[23:05:25] <tocsick> but it's just wordpress install basically
[23:05:29] <megatrond> then you could add the data-image in the php
[23:05:51] <tocsick> i can pb the plugin i'm using to upload images in wp-menu
[23:06:03] <megatrond> if you're adding it from the database, i mean
[23:06:07] <tocsick> but unfortunately the plugin works by creating a dynamic css file
[23:07:08] <JesperA> tocsick the client gonna change the menu structure alot via Menu in wp-admin? You would save alot of time just making your own menu instead of wp_nav_
[23:07:21] <Cork> tocsick: http://jsfiddle.net/Qsg6e/4/
[23:09:41] <tocsick> cork thank you so much
[23:09:57] <Cork> tocsick: not sure that will work for you though
[23:10:11] <Cork> its quite fragile
[23:10:35] <Whirl3d> coldhead, I read every word on the page your linked to and though it mentioned escaping special characters, it didn't really say which characters need escaping. So I am still screwed. 8(
[23:10:52] <tocsick> the plugin im using will add a class like "menu-banner-menu li-item4"
[23:11:14] <tocsick> sorry "cmi_menu_item_4" *
[23:11:36] <Cork> Whirl3d: http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Regular_expressions_1__Special_characters.html
[23:11:44] <tocsick> so the idea is to assign cmi_menu_item_4 to the div it is a child of, something like that
[23:12:24] <Cork> tocsick: but won't that break if they move menu options around?
[23:12:35] <Cork> or do that class stick?
[23:12:45] <tocsick> that class sticks because it's added by a plugin
[23:12:51] <Cork> ah
[23:12:53] <tocsick> yeah
[23:13:12] <JesperA> why use a plugin when the standard wp_menu function also do exactly that?
[23:13:12] <tocsick> and the plugin is linked to a dynamically generated stylesheet that specifies a background image per the assigned class
[23:13:17] <Whirl3d> Cork, perhaps I am not making myself clear. I have some great regexp that would work perfectly if I only knew which characters to escape. Unfortunately, the special characters in your list are just special because they give extra meaning, not because they need escaping
[23:13:34] <tocsick> jespera the plugin is to upload images within the menu dialog
[23:13:42] <WebDragon> can jquery.cycle function as a carousel slider showing more than one image at a time or do I need a different plugin for that ?
[23:13:42] <Whirl3d> cork, I appreciate your help, though. If I sound ungrateful, I'm just tired and frustrated. Sorry
[23:13:49] <Cork> Whirl3d: they do need to be escaped ifyou don't want there special meaning
[23:14:02] <Cork> Whirl3d: other then that theres only the normal string characters
[23:14:35] <coldhead> right on
[23:14:40] <Whirl3d> for example, you don't have to escape {}[]. etc.
[23:14:45] <Cork> yes
[23:14:54] <Whirl3d> if you do, you'll mess up your RegExp
[23:14:57] <Cork> if you don't want there grouping and alternative meaning
[23:15:07] <coldhead> forget about escaping, write your regex, if there's a problem, throw in some escapes
[23:15:11] <megatrond> Whirl3d: if you want to find a '[' in a string, you have to escape it
[23:15:45] <megatrond> Whirl3d: if you want to use [ for what it's supposed to do in a regex, you dont escape it
[23:15:57] <coldhead> it's kind of like making love: you don't need to read a giant list of things people have ound painful, if it doesn't feel good then don't do it
[23:16:02] <coldhead> unless you're into that
[23:16:05] <tocsick> how do i change $self.parent() to select the grandparent, or 3 parents up, etc?
[23:16:17] <coldhead> found painful*
[23:16:19] <megatrond> [\[] will match any single '['
[23:16:54] <megatrond> tocsick: maybe theres a better way, but $self.parent().parent()...
[23:17:09] <tocsick> thanks megatrond
[23:17:27] <coldhead> ?closest @ tocsick
[23:17:27] <bot-t> tocsick, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[23:17:50] <coldhead> that's better because it wont break if you add some extra elements between the child and the doting grandparent
[23:17:51] <megatrond> coldhead: thats a better way
[23:17:57] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to get my panel to slide: http://radiantstatic.com/build but it doesn't show up at all. any ideas?
[23:18:45] <tocsick> so could i do .closest('div').parent()
[23:18:48] <tocsick> ?
[23:19:06] <Cork> if its the first parent that is a div. ya
[23:19:12] <Cork> or if it has an id you can use that
[23:19:24] <megatrond> $self.closest('grandparentdiv') ?
[23:19:42] <Cork> or class or so on
[23:20:14] <coldhead> that will match <grandparentdiv>
[23:20:55] <Cork> and that element won't pass a w3c validation :)
[23:21:31] <tocsick> cork when hovering over <li class="1"> the script assigns 0 to the variable. is there a way to make it pull the class alphanumeric <li class="foo">?
[23:21:33] <megatrond> $self.closest('grandparentdivclassname') then
[23:21:35] <radiantstatic> Any ideas?
[23:21:37] <megatrond> baaah
[23:21:41] <megatrond> $self.closest('.grandparentdivclassname') then
[23:21:46] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[23:21:55] <Cork> tocsick: ya, my code used the position in the list
[23:21:57] <Double_Rainbow> why i cannot check if a var is NAN? if (parseInt($("#tarifOffreTheme").html()) == "NaN" )
[23:21:59] <megatrond> radiantstatic: didnt understand your question, really
[23:22:07] <tocsick> ah good idea megatrond
[23:22:22] <Double_Rainbow> tocsick: slick nick!
[23:22:27] <Cork> tocsick: you would have to regex grab the class you want from class
[23:22:29] <Eviltwin> isNaN(...)
[23:22:35] <coldhead> ?eval "NaN" === NaN
[23:22:36] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[23:22:39] <tocsick> ty double_rainbow
[23:22:40] <Double_Rainbow> Eviltwin: nice
[23:22:48] <radiantstatic> I have a sliding #mailContain panel that slides out when one of the divs is clicked. The panel doesn't shot up at all and I'm confuzzled.
[23:22:49] <coldhead> but then of course hilariously
[23:22:55] <coldhead> ?eval NaN === NaN
[23:22:56] <tocsick> cork - how do i do that?
[23:22:56] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[23:23:15] <Cork> ?mdc match

[23:23:49] <someprimetime> what do you guys think the best way of incrementing votes on a site would be? say i'm converting a string to an integer with parseInt(), I'm only allowing them to vote up or down once (assuming it's > 0).
[23:24:03] <Cork> tocsick: sorry you want .exec, not match
[23:24:51] <someprimetime> right now, i'm basically incrementing or decrementing based on which attribute the arrow has on it
[23:25:02] <someprimetime> the attribute is: dir="up" and dir="down"
[23:25:03] <tocsick> cork ??
[23:25:13] <someprimetime> which works fine, but i mean is there some best practice to do this?
[23:25:30] <Cork> tocsick: you have multible classes in your class="" variable, so you can't just use the attribute
[23:25:48] <Cork> so you need to extract the string that starts with li-
[23:25:53] <tocsick> oh okay, so instead grab the whole string and then regex it down
[23:26:10] <Cork> yes
[23:26:55] <Cork> tocsick: /li-[^ ]+/.exec(this.className)
[23:27:28] <Ukto> hmmm.. is there an easy way with the jquery modal to "post" form data, and update the modal content div with the result?
[23:27:42] <Cork> Ukto: sure
[23:28:13] <lijzz> hi i am loading some images into page. if the number of images is more than 6, i want a next and previous buttons on both sides, anyone have any jquery demo like this
[23:28:15] <Cork> just use the normal $.post and then do $('#dialog').html(newData);
[23:28:33] <radiantstatic> megatrond: Any idizlles?
[23:28:37] <Whirl3d> I don't understand why ("-").match(/[a-zA-Z, .\'-]/)==null
[23:28:49] <lijzz> Cork could u help me
[23:29:46] <Cork> Whirl3d: ("-").match(/[a-zA-Z, \.\'\-]/).length > 0
[23:30:04] <megatrond> radiantstatic: first, tag your scripts with correct type: <script type="text/javascript" src="..."></script>
[23:30:08] <Cork> lijzz: no i don't have a demo for that
[23:30:32] <lijzz> any idea on how to do that
[23:30:50] <Cork> Whirl3d: opps .length will fail if it doens't match
[23:30:55] <Ukto> Cork: thanks, just what I needed :)
[23:32:25] <megatrond> if ($(img).length > 6) { show arrows }
[23:32:46] <sneak_> i have an object returned by a selector, how do i further select from that object's children?
[23:32:49] <Cork> you forgot the ''
[23:33:02] <Cork> ?.find @ sneak_

[23:33:09] <sneak_> thx
[23:34:02] <lijzz> not only showing arrows
[23:34:15] <lijzz> when they click on arrows
[23:34:24] <lijzz> it should move to the next image
[23:34:36] <Mech0z> I cant get this http://pastebin.com/sztXw60F to toggle my IsExpanded class in this http://i41.tinypic.com/11252zt.png
[23:34:48] <lijzz> i need something like this
[23:34:50] <lijzz> http://css-plus.com/examples/2010/09/jquery-image-slider/
[23:34:56] <megatrond> lijzz: you can adjust the scrollLeft on click event
[23:35:00] <Whirl3d> http://www.bharveylawfirm.com/temp/contact101.html
[23:35:07] <Eviltwin> megatrond: .siblings
[23:35:09] <Eviltwin> Err
[23:35:14] <Eviltwin> Mech0z: .siblings
[23:35:43] <Eviltwin> $(this).children(...) means the children of this
[23:35:47] <lijzz> megatrond i did like this but this is using jquery 1.6, i have used another image slider in the page, that is getting disturbed after i used this one
[23:35:53] <Eviltwin> In this case the element with class accordion_header
[23:35:54] <sneak_> Cork: i misspoke. i am not talking about the result set from the selector, i'm talking about an individual element
[23:35:56] <Mech0z> Eviltwin: fantastic :)
[23:36:10] <sneak_> so $(selector)[7].find(otherselector) doesn't work
[23:36:25] <Cork> ?.eq $ sneak_
[23:36:26] <bot-t> Cork, How To Create a Stylish Content Slider using CSS3 & jQuery ... - http://spyrestudios.com/how-to-create-a-stylish-content-slider-using-css3-jquery/
[23:36:29] <Eviltwin> sneak_: Why would it?
[23:36:35] <Cork> [] will give the raw dom element
[23:36:44] <sneak_> how do i run selectors on a raw dom element.
[23:36:45] <Cork> ...
[23:36:46] <sneak_> ?
[23:36:51] <Cork> use .eq instead
[23:37:00] * Cork hits bot-t
[23:37:12] <sneak_> so i am expected to iterate over indexes?
[23:37:14] <Eviltwin> sneak_: You can make an DOM element into a jQuery object by calling $(...) on it
[23:37:18] <sneak_> ahhh
[23:37:18] <sneak_> thx
[23:37:40] <Eviltwin> sneak_: So you can do $($(selector)[7]).find(otherselector)
[23:37:45] <radiantstatic> megatrond: *whoopsâ€¦.fixed
[23:37:45] <sneak_> perfect, thanks
[23:37:48] <Eviltwin> sneak_: No
[23:37:56] <Eviltwin> Better: $(selector).eq(7).find(otherselector)
[23:38:21] <tocsick> sorry cork, im trying to figure this out and like i said, total jquery noob - how do i implement this regex? i can't even figure out how to grab the string from the <li>
[23:38:32] <Eviltwin> Or $(selector+":eq(7)").find(otherselector)
[23:38:39] <Eviltwin> tocsick: .text()
[23:38:45] <tocsick> http://jsfiddle.net/Qsg6e/6/
[23:38:48] <Cork> tocsick: i posted it to you before /li-[^ ]+/.exec(this.className)
[23:39:03] <Cork> Eviltwin: that won't be faster, and its ugglier
[23:39:14] <tocsick> so that replaces foo.index()?
[23:39:29] <Mech0z> Any idear to how I can store a sentence inside a div as a value that I can read with jquery (The word can be more than one word)  like "Contact Information"
[23:39:38] <Cork> tocsick: as long as this is the li dom element ya
[23:40:19] <Eviltwin> tocsick: http://jsfiddle.net/Qsg6e/7/
[23:40:50] <Cork> Mech0z: if you just want to store it, i would go with data see ?.data
[23:40:50] <bot-t> Mech0z, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[23:40:56] <Eviltwin> Cork: I didn't make it clear but I meant make his selector include :eq(7)
[23:41:14] <Cork> Eviltwin: :eq will just run .eq anyway
[23:41:26] <Eviltwin> True
[23:41:30] <Eviltwin> Although
[23:41:32] <Cork> and if you have a match, its ugglier
[23:41:36] <tocsick> wow - thank you so much eviltwin
[23:41:39] <tocsick> and cork for the regex
[23:41:49] <Eviltwin> $(".a .b:eq(7)") vs $(".a .b").eq(7)
[23:41:53] <Mech0z> Cork: hmm I need to load it into with Razor syntax, so would like if I didnt store it with jquery, but just in my cshtml file (pure html) if possible?
[23:42:04] <Eviltwin> I believe the first one will actually be faster
[23:42:18] <Eviltwin> Because it will grab all of the b's
[23:42:21] <Eviltwin> Only take the 7th
[23:42:24] <Cork> Eviltwin: i mean more like var select = $('.a .b'); select.eq(7).find
[23:42:31] <Eviltwin> Then check if it has an ancestor of .a
[23:43:05] <Cork> Eviltwin: :eq qill run .a .b, then loop over them and find number 7
[23:43:10] <Cork> so its just as slow as .eq
[23:43:24] <Cork> well not loop, but look in the array
[23:43:34] <Cork> both does the exact same thing
[23:43:57] <radiantstatic> This is so frustrating.
[23:44:07] <tocsick> cork eviltwin thank you so much - im gonna take all this and now try to plug it into wp successfully
[23:45:01] <Eviltwin> Cork: Actually, I was wrong
[23:45:02] <Eviltwin> Cork: http://jsperf.com/eq-7
[23:46:06] <Cork> Eviltwin: almost all : selectors are callbacks
[23:46:16] <Cork> they get the matches from left as an array
[23:46:22] <Cork> and then loop over them to filter the results
[23:46:34] <Cork> then continue the matches
[23:46:46] <Cork> i'm a bit supriced thats slower actually
[23:47:01] <Cork> would have expects farly close to the same speed
[23:47:09] <Eviltwin> So there must be something else going on
[23:47:16] <Cork> oh, wait
[23:47:28] <Cork> i think the callback is called on each match
[23:47:36] <Cork> so it has to check .index() == 7
[23:47:41] <Cork> that would explain it
[23:48:02] <Cork> .eq() just grabs the 7'th match from the array
[23:48:18] <Eviltwin> Yup
[23:48:51] <Eviltwin> $.fn.eq isn't an alias for .filter(":eq(...)") like some of the others basically are
[23:49:11] <Whirl3d> is String.fromCharCode() the wrong function to convert e.which into a string? http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/kLTHM/11/
[23:49:23] <Cork> Eviltwin: btw thx for reminding me about that, page, had totaly forgotten it
