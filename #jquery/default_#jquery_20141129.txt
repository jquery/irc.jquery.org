[01:47:23] <ManicPanic> hello, i dont know the value of the key to loop this json data, what am i doing wrong? http://pastie.org/9750092
[02:13:31] <Kartagis> okay, I've added some eventhandler to my site, but what could cause it not to fire?
[02:18:05] <darrenlooby> So, I'm doing a on(click) on a <li>. It's somewhere in a <div class="slide">. I want to know what (.slide).index() is - however, I want the index of (.slide) based on the entire page. Whereas, because there are a couple of <div class="slide"> in each <div class="pane">, and more than one <div class="pane">, it's returning an index with respect of pane - not body.
[03:42:11] <Kartagis> okay, I've added some eventhandler to my site, but what could cause it not to fire?
[03:49:28] <Duvdevan> Kartagis post your code on jsfiddle or elsewhere
[03:49:54] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/vt45zsb4/
[03:50:50] <Woet> Kartagis: works fine as you can see
[03:51:09] <Kartagis> Woet: but not on my site
[03:51:19] <Woet> Kartagis: then reproduce it on jsfiddle
[03:51:59] <Duvdevan> have you added $(function() { /* your code */ }); or $(document).ready(function() { /* your code */ });
[03:52:00] <Duvdevan> ?
[03:52:37] <Duvdevan> Kartagis, btw, it's better to use $('body').on('click', '.messages',  function() { /* your code */ });
[03:55:13] <Kartagis> Duvdevan: jquery < 1.5, so .on is not an option
[03:56:14] <Kartagis> Duvdevan: anyway, why is it better than $(".messages")....?

[08:04:22] <reynierpm> hi there and moorning, I need some help with RegEx, maybe this is not the best place to ask for this but since I am using it on a HTML/jQuery code I can give some answers here
[08:06:25] <reynierpm> I am trying to validate phone numbers with this valid syntax +584242511330 (is valid), 00584242511330 (is valid), 4242511330 (is valid), (424)251.13.30 (is valid) and this is what I have so far /^\+(?:[0-9] ?){6,14}[0-9]$/ but is not working since some valid phone numbers does not validate, can I have some help?
[09:24:26] <reynierpm> hi there and moorning I need some help on this code http://jsbin.com/debopiliso/1/edit?js,output first it is showing nothing and second I need to return a join value removing contained values from arr2 and arr1, for example result should be "Cnt1", "Cnt2", "Cnt3", "Cnt4", "Cnt5", "Cnt46", "Cnt7", can any give me some help?
[09:30:00] <shoky> reynierpm: http://jsbin.com/wokoyereze/1/edit?js,output
[09:31:03] <reynierpm> excellent shoky let me try in my code brb
[10:01:22] <reynierpm> shoky one question if I want to wrap each output as for example on Btn1 click event get something like <span id=1>Cnt1</span>, <span id=2>Cnt2</span>, <span id=3>Cnt3</span>, <span id=4>Cnt4</span>, <span id=5>Cnt5</span>, <span id=6>Cnt46</span>, <span id=7>Cnt7</span>, how can I get this done? I made another jsBin take a look here http://jsbin.com/lajiqotuzi/1/edit?js,output
[10:14:14] <shoky> reynierpm: http://jsbin.com/zaraxumafi/1/edit?js,output
[10:18:07] <reynierpm> shoky can be arr1 and arr2 on showList dynamic? Right now and for example purposes are two of them but I am building them dinamically so perhaps are arr1 and arr2 but could be also arr1, arr2, arr3, arr4, arrN how I get ride of this? I mean how I can generalize the function for works with any qty of arrays?
[10:21:08] <shoky> reynierpm: http://jsbin.com/zaraxumafi/2/edit?js,output
[10:23:17] <reynierpm> shoky is not working
[10:23:46] <shoky> ?
[10:23:47] <reynierpm> shoky try to add a new array to btn2 and pass it to showList and you will see what I am talking about
[10:24:20] <reynierpm> shoky can you see what I have edited on your code or do I need to clone it on a new bin?
[10:24:21] <shoky> reynierpm: works fine  http://jsbin.com/zaraxumafi/3/edit
[10:24:43] <shoky> no i can't see your changes
[10:25:36] <reynierpm> shoky yes something weird I was going to the first one and yes it works
[10:25:45] <reynierpm> let me try here on my env waits
[10:32:03] <reynierpm> shoky I made a small modification adding a new button and changing $(#update).html() to $(#update).append() because I need to keep previous values in #update and append the new ones but is not working, nothing works, if you click any button nothing is output http://jsbin.com/yiyegalefi/1/edit?js,output what is wrong there?
[10:33:50] <shoky> reynierpm: you're using .appendTo not .append.  also jquery isn't included.  also, if you're gonna append then you can't keep adding the spans with the same ID's. duplicate ID's are invalid
[10:38:55] <reynierpm> shoky take a look at the code again, I fix somethings and add a new code (at end) let me try to show you where exactly your code should fit in mine
[10:41:42] <reynierpm> shoky http://jsbin.com/yiyegalefi/1/edit?js,output paisesFromEntity will get a JSON object like this one {"success":true,"entities":[{"pais":"Argentina"},{"pais":"Bolivia"}],"idToUpdate":"1"} I convert easily to something like {"success":true,"entities":[{"pais": {"1", "Argentina"}},{"pais":{"2":"Bolivia"}}],"idToUpdate":"1"} where 1 and 2 will be the ids and those comes from DB so not way to be repeated
[10:42:19] <reynierpm> shoky the big idea will be pass that JSON to the code you provide and get span with each id and names
[10:42:26] <reynierpm> shoky did you get it?
[10:42:34] <reynierpm> shoky can you help me with this?
[10:43:33] <shoky> reynierpm: if you have a specific question, i can help with that
[10:44:24] <reynierpm> shoky waits give me some minutes I am testing something here
[10:50:54] <reynierpm> shoky ok, not problem I will figure out how to deal with the other problem but for now see what is happening: first if you click on btn1, right, values are append but if you click on btn2 then right values are append but result is wrong since it miss a colon , right after add the new ones, for example Cnt1, Cnt2, Cnt3, Cnt4, Cnt5, Cnt46, Cnt7, Cnt99Cnt10, Cnt21, Cnt51, Cnt461, Cnt71, Cnt52, Cnt8 should be Cnt1, Cnt2, Cnt3, Cnt4, Cnt5, Cnt46, Cnt7, Cnt
[10:51:20] <reynierpm> shoky ok, not problem I will figure out how to deal with the other problem but for now see what is happening: first if you click on btn1, right, values are append but if you click on btn2 then right values are append but result is wrong since it miss a colon , right after add the new ones, for example Cnt1, Cnt2, Cnt3, Cnt4, Cnt5, Cnt46, Cnt7, Cnt99Cnt10, Cnt21, Cnt51, Cnt461, Cnt71, Cnt52, Cnt8 should be Cnt1, Cnt2, Cnt3, Cnt4, Cnt5, Cnt46, Cnt7, Cnt
[10:52:16] <Sacho> ..
[10:52:19] <reynierpm> shoky are you reading my msg? I am getting a weird issue here telling me that IRC does not understan teen command or something like that
[10:52:51] <Sacho> the error you're probably getting is that your message is too long.
[10:53:01] <reynierpm> Sacho perhaps
[10:53:06] <reynierpm> let me try again
[10:53:18] <reynierpm> shoky shoky ok, not problem I will figure out how to deal with the other problem but for now see what is happening: first if you click on btn1, right, values are append but if you click on btn2 then right values are append but result is wrong since it miss a colon , right after add the new ones, for example Cnt1, Cnt2, Cnt3, Cnt4, Cnt5, Cnt46, Cnt7, Cnt99Cnt10, Cnt21, Cnt51, Cnt461, Cnt71, Cnt52, Cnt8 should be
[10:53:22] <reynierpm> shoky Cnt1, Cnt2, Cnt3, Cnt4, Cnt5, Cnt46, Cnt7, Cnt99, Cnt10, Cnt21, Cnt51, Cnt461, Cnt71, Cnt52, Cnt8 the colon between Cnt99 (end of the first execution result) and Cnt10 (start of second execution result) is missing, any workaround on this?
[10:53:34] <reynierpm> Sacho right, it is done now thx
[10:54:00] <shoky> reynierpm: yes.. you can't think of a way to do it?
[10:55:12] <reynierpm> shoky what you mean, do it by myself? if it is that, yes, I am on it but can get it to works also I am thinking in how to fit your solution on mine
[10:55:51] <shoky> well if you can do it by yourself.. try that first :P
[10:57:32] <reynierpm> shoky hehehe well the thing is I can not since I do not know how to I am thinking and thinking and my head is a crazy thing so if it is not tu much to ask could you help me? Just to be clear I am not pretending you do my job or something like that I am just finding for people more advanced than me on jQuery world
[11:00:16] <shoky> reynierpm:  if ($('#update').text().length >0) { $('#update').append(', '); }
[11:01:11] <reynierpm> shoky so simple and I was looking for something more complicated
[11:01:20] <reynierpm> shoky waits let me try
[11:02:48] <reynierpm> shoky and voala is working you are the man hehehehe :)
[11:05:01] <shoky> ;]
[11:24:08] <reynierpm> shoky you still there?
[11:27:06] <reynierpm> shoky I am trying to convert predefined `#update` to a dynamic value but once again is not clear to me how to do it, this is what I have right now http://jsbin.com/yiyegalefi/1/edit?js,output
[11:27:12] <reynierpm> but is not working
[11:29:47] <shoky> reynierpm:   var concatenatedArr1 = fullList.concat.apply(fullList, [].slice.call(arguments, 1))
[11:55:59] <mikesm> does anyone know why the sortable li's change height when being dragged? http://jsfiddle.net/fusilli_jerry89/9ack4y5z/
[12:09:08] <Fenhl> hello. I have a bootstrap page where a tab is preselected based on location.hash (one of these pages is at http://wurstmineberg.de/people/fenhl#items for example)
[12:09:50] <Fenhl> the problem is that the tab doesn't change when I manually replace the hash in Chrome's location bar and hit return. It only changes when I hit return a second time
[12:10:54] <Fenhl> I think Chrome is detecting that I only changed the hash and tries to scroll the viewport without reloading. Can I somehow detect this to fire the ‚Äúupdate active tab‚Äù function when a user does that?
[12:15:39] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[12:27:19] <Fenhl> found it: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2162174/667338
[12:51:22] <reynierpm> shoky, is almost done but I need some push here http://jsbin.com/yiyegalefi/1/edit?js,output take a look if for any reason any of  the array passed to showList function gets ¬®undefined¬® then the output will be ¬®undefined, Countr1, Country2, CountryN¬® and that is wrong, how can I add a condition and where to avoid this?
[12:54:40] <nathaneltitane> question: is it possible to unhide a div.container.hidden on page 2 from the detection of a clicked href anchor on page 1?
[12:55:24] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: You'd need to use cookies or localStorage, but sure. I can't help but feel like you cant' find a better approach though.
[12:55:55] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: Filter out the array items you don't want.
[12:56:22] <shoky> reynierpm: that won't work anymore now that you changed it from strings to objects. it won't remove duplicates properly now
[12:57:31] <nathaneltitane> BillCriswell: well define other approach? how would you go about in doing it w/o cookies
[12:57:48] <nathaneltitane> i'm no expert in the matter...
[12:58:27] <BillCriswell> When you say "page" so you mean a whole other HTML document?
[12:59:00] <nathaneltitane> BillCriswell: her eis the thing, my site is a blogger hosted blog | website
[12:59:08] <nathaneltitane> so yes, a whole other page
[12:59:13] <nathaneltitane> is*
[12:59:22] <nathaneltitane> page as in document, yes
[12:59:39] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: In that case it sounds like a cookie or localStorage might be your only chance.
[13:00:52] <nathaneltitane> so, concretely speaking, clicking the href on http://nathaneltitane.blogspot.ca/p/lego_11.html would reveal div.container.hidden with a specific id in whatever page the href sends it to
[13:01:10] <nathaneltitane> still within the blog domain though
[13:01:51] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: You can use localStorage or a cookie to accomplish that.
[13:03:06] <BillCriswell> Something like.. $('#some-link').on('click', function () { localStorage.setItem('showSomethingOnOtherPage', '1'); }); then on the other page something like if (localStorage.getItem('showSomethingOnOtherPage')) { $('#some-id').show(); });
[13:04:43] <shoky> reynierpm: http://jsbin.com/wicisimizo/2/edit?js,output
[13:06:49] <nathaneltitane> billcriswell: hmm, seems complicated. different approach: can jquery handle the whole href process? click href#id on page 1, open href#id(page 2_ and unhide href#id(page 2) ?
[13:08:36] <nathaneltitane> in that case it would be a single jquery script under the lego.html that can handle the whole thing no?
[13:08:49] <nathaneltitane> since all the hrefs are hardcoded
[13:12:32] <BillCriswell> You can put that all into one script if you wanted.
[13:13:38] <BillCriswell> It's just since things happen on two different pages you need something to keep the data across multiple pages.
[13:14:49] <BillCriswell> localStorage, a cookie or some session data is the only way to accomplish that on separate pages.
[13:15:23] <nathaneltitane> BillCriswell: even if i use preventDefault?
[13:15:50] <BillCriswell> preventDefault() would keep you from going to the second page all together.
[13:16:49] <nathaneltitane> yes, and have jquery do it for me
[13:17:01] <nathaneltitane> and process the whole lthing alltogether
[13:17:25] <BillCriswell> Is the div you want to show on the same page as the link?
[13:17:49] <BillCriswell> Would you want to call that div over to the page with the link on it?
[13:17:56] <nathaneltitane> nope, on the second page, which is where the link goes to
[13:19:42] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: HTTP is stateless. The browser has no idea the person who will click the link on the first page will be the person arriving at the second page.
[13:20:05] <ortho> Hi I am using latest jQuery and jQuery mobile but when I load dynamic content via ajax and inject it, it will flick / blink the screen before doing transition
[13:20:18] <nathaneltitane> Billcriswell, i see
[13:20:27] <ortho> is there a workaround?
[13:20:32] <BillCriswell> That's why we need the cookie or the localStorage.
[13:20:54] <BillCriswell> You can get the div from the other page and put it like.. right under where you click the link if you wanted to do something like that.
[13:22:20] <Fenhl> can someone please help me debug the bootstrap tab bar on this page? http://dev.wurstmineberg.de/stats#achievements As you can see, it displays the Achievements tab for a bit, and then switches over to Leaderboards
[13:22:49] <Fenhl> that is, it switches to the content of Leaderboards, even though the Achievements tab is correctly selected
[13:23:04] <nathaneltitane> BillCriswell: not sure i understand that last part
[13:24:44] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: Say you wanted to do like $('#link-from-page-a').on('click', function () { $('#content-div-for-content-from-page-b').load('/page-b.html #some-div-on-page-b'); });
[13:25:05] <BillCriswell> So when you click the link, it grabs the div from B and loads it into a.
[13:25:30] <nathaneltitane> i prefer '_blank'
[13:25:45] <Fenhl> ‚Ä¶okay, disregard that, I should get a rubber duck
[13:25:49] <BillCriswell> Then you need to use a cookie or localStorage.
[13:26:13] <nathaneltitane> so without blank no need for localstorage?
[13:26:52] <BillCriswell> You need localStorage or a cookie if you want page a to affect page b.
[13:27:07] <nathaneltitane> got it
[13:27:19] <nathaneltitane> so let'S go without it and load on A
[13:27:47] <BillCriswell> or you can make the link like: /page-b.html?clicked=foo and look for clicked=foo in the URL and so something based on that.
[13:28:24] <nathaneltitane> billcriswell: problem is i can only manage the basics of JQ JS atm, might need some help
[13:28:42] <BillCriswell> I already pretty much gave you the code.
[13:28:57] <nathaneltitane> if i have $(this).attr('href') - how do i isolate the id part as #id
[13:29:22] <nathaneltitane> billcriswell, yes i know, i am using it
[13:29:41] <ortho> when using transitions and injecting html dynamically it flicks for a second. Any solution?
[13:29:42] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: You mean the hash on the url or the id attribute of this?
[13:29:55] <nathaneltitane> the hash
[13:30:22] <nathaneltitane> no my bad, the id attr
[13:30:25] <BillCriswell> I believe you can just do this.hash
[13:30:31] <BillCriswell> Oh,
[13:30:35] <BillCriswell> then this.id
[13:30:40] <nathaneltitane> cool
[13:30:54] <BillCriswell> or $(this).prop('id') or $(this).prop('hash')
[13:31:01] <BillCriswell> but it'll all get you to the same plac.
[13:32:14] <nathaneltitane> hmm ok
[13:32:30] <nathaneltitane> as long as the right tag is set on page B i assume
[13:41:05] <ortho> when using transitions and injecting html dynamically it flicks for a second. Any solution?
[13:43:33] <BillCriswell> ortho: Are you making sure the html is set before you run the transition.
[13:44:29] <ortho> ajax call is a first thing that i do, then inject it
[13:44:42] <ortho> of course it is only on transition that gets me back
[13:44:58] <ortho> only if the content requires to resize the window (implement scroll)
[13:45:15] <ortho> if dynamic content is fitting the size, it is fine
[13:46:06] <BillCriswell> ortho: What if you do like $('#el-that-gets-html').html(someHTML); then do $('#el-that-gets-html').addClass('class-that-triggers-transition');
[13:46:58] <ortho> i will try, but first i disable transitions at all maybe it is not the case
[13:47:24] <BillCriswell> It's pretty tough to figure out without being able to see it.
[13:48:12] <ortho> yes that is true, maybe i should not inject html just with .html()
[13:48:20] <ortho> are there a better methods for that?
[13:48:30] <BillCriswell> It shouldn't matter how it gets there.
[14:00:25] <ortho_> BillCriswell: Looks like it is not transitions
[14:00:43] <ortho_> after disabling it still flickers, it is resizing the window
[14:42:34] <nathaneltitane> billcriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/1azf8rbv/2/
[14:43:57] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: Mm hmm
[14:44:13] <nathaneltitane> can't get the damn url to actually show :/
[14:45:34] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: Some of your urls are just #
[14:45:58] <nathaneltitane> forget those billcriswell, I'll be getting rid of those
[14:46:28] <nathaneltitane> or i might just add the main url on those
[14:46:56] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[14:47:50] <nathaneltitane> billcriswell, so technically, all but the first sub-entries are hidden by default, how do i make it load using $toshow to unhide?
[14:48:56] <nathaneltitane> ($toshow is already used with a .load-more anchor on the main url to reveal the hidden divs for navigation)
[14:51:19] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: where is the .container ?
[14:51:57] <nathaneltitane> .container is one page 2 (the url that is supposed to be shown)
[14:52:46] <nathaneltitane> so, rationale is: click on link, load url and show the div.container.hidden using $toshow
[14:53:04] <nathaneltitane> on page 2***
[14:54:06] <nathaneltitane> if you do window.open(url) it'll show the contents that need to be revealed..
[14:54:18] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[14:59:44] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: http://jsfiddle.net/1azf8rbv/3/ this i how I'd approach it. Basically .load('/url.html #id-of-element-you-want');
[15:01:31] <nathaneltitane> load-content-here as an added div to the page?
[15:02:19] <BillCriswell> Yeah, or any div you can get to from the link.
[15:02:25] <BillCriswell> That was just an example.
[15:02:36] <nathaneltitane> doesnt work... :/
[15:03:05] <nathaneltitane> http://jsfiddle.net/1azf8rbv/4/
[15:04:09] <BillCriswell> You're aware it wouldn't actually work in the fiddle, right?
[15:04:52] <BillCriswell> Javascript can't load things from another domain.
[15:05:51] <BillCriswell> (without the proper setup).
[15:06:04] <nathaneltitane> oh nice :)
[15:11:14] <nathaneltitane> little problem billcriswell, the mobile suits list is really long and it cannot seem to load the container bc of the hover...
[15:12:54] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: Not following.
[15:13:10] <nathaneltitane> might be ul issue.. gimme a second...
[15:13:49] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[15:15:53] <mikesm> Does anyone know a good way to debug css animations that use jquery?
[15:16:19] <nathaneltitane> billcriswell: well there was a missing /ul but that was not it
[15:16:37] <mikesm> For example, here http://jsfiddle.net/nxn5ts0f/ I isolated the bug on the third draggable div (there needs to be a space before the closing a tag)
[15:17:13] <nathaneltitane> you see how the hover triggers the drawer to open? well the 'Mobile suits' one has over 30 models in it. clicking any of those does not load into the div properly bc of the hover or scrolling...
[15:17:21] <mikesm> Is there an easier way to track down bugs like this? For example, in chrome devtools or firebug is there a way to watch how the css changes as I drag the div around?
[15:17:32] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: Just can't use hover on touch screens.
[15:20:04] <nathaneltitane> oh no
[15:20:06] <nathaneltitane> my bad
[15:20:10] <nathaneltitane> found the issue
[15:20:16] <drej> BillCriswell: hoverhand
[15:20:29] <nathaneltitane> so stupid... forgot to quote the hrefs :(
[15:21:07] <nathaneltitane> billcriswell, in css?
[15:21:31] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: You could use :hover for visual stuff, but functional stuff I'd avoid it.
[15:24:42] <BillCriswell> mikesm: You can inspect the li as you move it.
[15:25:42] <mikesm> BillCriswell: can you pause it? For example, if I clicked and dragged a div and then paused it in place so I could inspect how the css has changed?
[15:27:00] <BillCriswell> Not on style changes as far as I know.
[15:31:49] <nathaneltitane> billcriswell, i think it has to do with the hidden divs, only the first ones are shoing....
[15:31:52] <nathaneltitane> showing*
[15:32:28] <BillCriswell> nathaneltitane: Ar you tyring to find that relative to the link?
[15:33:01] <BillCriswell> mikesm: The width jQuery calculates just seems a bit off. I think you'd need to set a width there.
[15:33:06] <nathaneltitane> meaning?
[15:34:00] <mikesm> BillCriswell: Okay that makes sense.
[15:34:14] <nathaneltitane> well they are relative bc the are loaded from the url billcriswell
[15:34:19] <mikesm> BillCriswell: btw did you do anything specific to figure that out? Or just intuition?
[15:34:37] <BillCriswell> I just looked at the li's styles as I was dragging.
[15:35:00] <BillCriswell> When I removed the 42px it goes back onto one line.
[15:36:18] <mikesm> oh okay. Thanks for your help!
[15:36:24] <BillCriswell> mikesm: No problem.
[15:40:55] <nathaneltitane> BillCriswell: well they are relative as div.container.hidden is loaded from url into div.load-here
[15:41:07] <nathaneltitane> no?
[15:43:44] <cuppy> Is there a wonderful resource about the new History with diagrams, flow charts, et cetera yet?
[15:48:45] <reynierpm> shoky I need some advice here http://jsbin.com/ruxidaxuxu/1/edit see the code is not working for arr4 on btn1 click event, I can convert arr1, arr2 to act as arr4 but not reverse can you give me some help?
[15:50:37] <shoky> reynierpm: arr4 has a different structure than the others
[15:53:30] <shoky> reynierpm: so the same code won't work for it.. don't know what you want me to do about it
[16:09:54] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to change the status of a div but I not get results. Any help pleaseø http://jsfiddle.net/jpjac74m/2/
[16:13:01] <systemfault> To change the content of .data, you need to pass the new value as the second argument.
[16:13:24] <abailarri> systemfault, how?
[16:14:14] <systemfault> $(".answeredOne").data('status', '0'); instead of $(".answeredOne").data('status') = '0'; ?
[16:14:41] <systemfault> Also, line 3 is a global variable.
[16:14:45] <systemfault> (status is)
[16:15:01] <systemfault> Because you haven't used the "var" keyword
[16:16:42] <abailarri> systemfault, http://jsfiddle.net/jpjac74m/6/
[16:16:46] <abailarri> works!! :-)
[16:17:01] <systemfault> :)
[17:14:04] <spudzee> okay, javascript didn't help me with this question
[17:14:15] <spudzee> or ##javascript, I should say
[17:15:00] <spudzee> is there any way to nullify scrolling so when I scroll down it does nothing on my page?
[17:15:19] <BillCriswell> spudzee: That's more of a css question.
[17:15:41] <BillCriswell> but overflow: hidden and height: 100%; on <html> should do the trick.
[17:15:44] <spudzee> well it leads directly to another question I have which is jquery related
[17:16:18] <spudzee> maybe if I give you some context that might help
[17:16:53] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[17:16:55] <spudzee> I have a bit of jquery code kindly given to me by a friend
[17:17:00] <spudzee> on this chat
[17:17:14] <spudzee> I don't really know how it works that well
[17:18:18] <spudzee> but basically what it does is when you're scrolling and you scroll slightly over a div with class='scrollsnap', it will scroll all the way down so that the top of the div is at the top of your page
[17:18:34] <spudzee> smoothly
[17:18:49] <BillCriswell> ok
[17:18:59] <spudzee> the problem I'm having is
[17:19:34] <spudzee> I'm having my website all be in one page, and I use the scrolling mechanism to go to the different parts of the page
[17:20:13] <spudzee> I have all the parts on the page, say 'home','about','whatever'. All of these are sections of the page you reach by using this scrolling mechanic
[17:20:53] <spudzee> I hope I'm visualizing this well
[17:21:01] <spudzee> or, explaining it well
[17:21:39] <BillCriswell> Yeah I think I got you so far.
[17:21:52] <spudzee> all of the sections on the page are made to fit the entire screen
[17:22:18] <spudzee> when you re size the page, the sections are cut off a little bit
[17:22:32] <spudzee> so you'd have like half a paragraph
[17:22:39] <spudzee> on 'about'
[17:22:57] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[17:23:03] <spudzee> when you scroll down to get that last bit, it will think you're trying to get to the next section
[17:23:14] <spudzee> and push you all the way down
[17:23:28] <spudzee> this is a very complicated problem
[17:23:36] <spudzee> but basically I want it to not do that
[17:24:27] <spudzee> my solution to this is changing how much you scroll down based on how far the next section is from you
[17:25:27] <BillCriswell> Yeah I guess I'd just change the sensitivity of the snap.
[17:25:45] <spudzee> so my ideal scenario would be, say you're on the 'about' section, you're seeing half a paragraph. If you scroll down, it will hit the bottom of the page. and if you scroll down again, it will go to the next section
[17:26:08] <spudzee> not the bottom of the page
[17:26:14] <spudzee> the bottom of 'about'
[17:26:25] <spudzee> so you can see the rest of the about paragraph
[17:27:12] <BillCriswell> spudzee: Not sure I'm the best person to give advice on this because I can't stand when a site messes with my scrolling haha
[17:27:36] <spudzee> yeah I get that too, but this is a requirement for the page
[17:27:44] <spudzee> sadly
[17:27:51] <spudzee> so I have to make it work
[17:28:45] <spudzee> all I need to know is how to control how much you scroll on each mousewheel down
[17:29:07] <BillCriswell> spudzee: I'm not sure you have much say in that.
[17:29:51] <spudzee> how about whenever you scroll, it will just undo a certain amount of the scroll
[17:31:42] <spudzee> alright, I'll just do some research and see if I can't come up with something
[17:32:14] <BillCriswell> That would end terribly I would think, since you can't detect how much a mouse wheel down would actually scroll.
[17:33:31] <spudzee> think about it for second
[17:34:13] <spudzee> all I have to do is constantly keep track of where you are, and when you move just find a delta
[17:34:53] <spudzee> I just need to know what I should use to do the adjusting bit
[17:35:13] <spudzee> how do I control what your distance from top is?
[17:35:47] <BillCriswell> scrollTop
[17:36:08] <spudzee> okay, so give me an example of how to use scrollTop?
[17:37:02] <hagb4rd> just read the value it holds
[17:37:24] <spudzee> then how do I physically scroll you to some point on the page?
[17:37:36] <spudzee> well, not physically, but you get the point
[17:38:00] <hagb4rd> you can catch the mousewheel event .. read the value of scrollTop and and depending on e.direction set it to a new value
[17:38:21] <BillCriswell> You can use .animate({ scrollTop: '200px' }).
[17:39:50] <spudzee> okay, let me try something
[18:09:22] <spudzee> I have a quick question
[18:09:56] <spudzee> how do I get the distance between the bottom of where you are and the bottom of a div?
[18:13:45] <BillCriswell> scrollTop and window height for the bottom of where you are.
[18:14:13] <BillCriswell> div offset top and div height for the bottom of where that div is.
[18:15:32] <RekinBad> man I can't believe this far I didn't find this editor lol, ive tried every single editor and just yesterday i found the diamond in dirt... I how how the hell this editor is burried under these popular but inferior editors... this thing is jaw-droppingly good editor in my opinion... if anybody doesn't know about it give a try, its WebStorm 9
[18:16:06] <RekinBad> BTW: im not spamming or advertising by any means, its just am so happy about my discovery that I feel I should share it cuz I really think most guys will like this thing lol
[18:19:42] <Oka> Right...
[18:20:13] <BillCriswell> Looks a little much for my taste.
[18:20:57] <Oka> Mmm.
[18:22:22] <RekinBad> Ive tried all editors out there and really as i saw this at the first glance i thought its superior over any other editor for windows in existance, this is much like Xcode for OS
[18:23:17] <BillCriswell> Glad you found something you dig.
[18:23:36] <Oka> BillCriswell: The correct response here is 'Cool Beans'.
[18:23:47] <RekinBad> thanks man i really love this damn thing :)
[18:24:42] <BillCriswell> Oka: It roughly translates to that.
[18:25:49] <RekinBad> is any of you guys have an opinion of bootcamps for web dev/soft eng. ? Im thinking of getting into one and I wonder whats your take on such programs?
[18:31:10] <RekinBad> hmm i seee....
[18:31:32] <BillCriswell> RekinBad: It depends on so many things.
[18:33:25] <RekinBad> BillCriswell ultimate goal - get a decent job AND obtain decent knowledge in either soft dev/web dev, the only two options I've are General Assembly or Sabio LA, would have anything to say? opinion or an idea?
[18:40:42] <BillCriswell> It would be hard for me to have an opinion on it to be honest RekinBad.
[18:43:29] <RekinBad> BillCriswell I see:) well, thanks anyways Bill.
[18:43:33] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:56:22] <waysc> RekinBad: I used to teach at MakerSquare :)
[18:57:09] <waysc> I can't say much about GA - they're very growth-focused so the classes are smaller and more self-driven from what I've heard, but makersquare and hackreactor are great. do your due diligence though, as there are lots of schools that aren't quite up to snuff
[19:01:35] <RekinBad> waysc nice! thanks a lot for response man, I was looking for such an answer lol, here is my issue, the bootcamp I ought attend must be in-person since I've hard time learning online and I think MakerSquare isn't available in Los Angeles right? if that's the case I'm stuck with GA(which I don't find myself to be 'that' great after reading some reviews online) and Sabio i guess seems ok since
[19:01:36] <RekinBad> there isn't too much info on it? what you say?:) sorry for long post mate.
[19:02:06] <waysc> I don't know anything about sabio personally - if SF is an option for you, MakerSquare also has offices in SF
[19:02:16] <waysc> there's also online options like udemy, code school, etc.
[19:02:34] <waysc> ah, sorry, missed that bit about online not working well
[19:02:49] <waysc> have you checked out http://coursereport.com/ yet?
[19:03:01] <RekinBad> aha:( I need in-person courses... let me look that up:)
[19:03:38] <waysc> RekinBad: https://www.coursereport.com/schools?focus=Everything&location=Los+Angeles
[19:03:47] <RekinBad> hmmmm looks tastey man lol let me see dig in it:)
[19:05:50] <RekinBad> waysc awesome source man, thanks a lot, seems like they've got the info I need
[19:40:16] <BillCriswell> waysc: Do those kinds of things pay well (if you don't mind me asking)?
[19:40:46] <waysc> I'm not sure about other schools, but I was pretty happy with what I made
[19:41:06] <waysc> most of them are definitely startups though, and it was a lot of work
[19:41:41] <waysc> the biggest challenge was helping the students emotionally, a lot of breakdowns/anxiety/etc. about the future
[19:42:04] <BillCriswell> waysc: Yeah I could imagine.
[19:42:32] <BillCriswell> It's not the easiest thing to learn quickly.
[19:43:29] <waysc> definitely not. although, I've been amazed at what students have come in knowing and made by the end, it gave me a lot of respect for what you can learn if you literally do nothing else for 3 months
[19:45:23] <BillCriswell> waysc: Do the places you've taught provide equipment for the students or are they on their own?
[19:46:02] <waysc> at my gig the students need to bring their own laptops, but we provide monitors, cables, space, snacks, that sort of thing
[19:46:12] <waysc> something we recommended for low budget was chromebooks with ubuntu
[19:46:58] <BillCriswell> Sounds awesome.
[19:47:15] <RekinBad> sounds cute place... unforunate its not in LA lol
[19:56:31] <BillCriswell> waysc: What type of qualifications were needed for teaching those classes? I think I might enjoy doing that.
[19:58:25] <waysc2> BillCriswell: sorry, my internet exploded. I had been mentoring with MakerSquare for a while so they knew my credentials/work history prior, but it was pretty much like any other dev job credentials, except also a really large emphasis on interpersonal and educational skills
[20:00:27] <waysc2> I guess beyond "any other dev credentials", it would be knowing the material/basics down really really pat. I had to do some research at the start on a lot of things that I had forgotten or didn't know all the way down to the bottom at first, because the students will ask about everything
[20:02:11] <BillCriswell> That makes sense. I figured a really solid understanding of the basics would be key.
[20:04:57] <waysc2> BillCriswell: yeah, it was a blast. I definitely recommend it, although you have to watch out for the burnout. at least at MakerSquare, there was -so much to do-, I didn't have much time for high level coding. I think teaching dev is great in a tour-of-duty sort of way
[20:07:04] <BillCriswell> Yeah it sounds fun. I might just look into that. I enjoy helping out here enough and think it would be much easier helping someone face to face.
[20:53:33] <aquaguy> Hello
[20:55:16] <aquaguy> I'm using jquery ui's draggable and droppable.  $myDroppable.droppable({'hoverClass': 'myClass', over: function (e, ui) { $(this).addClass('myOtherClass')); }}); none of both methods is adding the class to the droppable
[20:55:45] <aquaguy> over function is being executed as console.log($(this)[0]) prints the correct droppable DOM element
[20:59:11] <aquaguy> http://jsfiddle.net/cwjw8vn6/
[20:59:18] <aquaguy> There's the working sample
[21:00:12] <Technodrome> Good day
[21:06:06] <BillCriswell> aquaguy: I can't tell if this is working or not.
[21:06:48] <aquaguy> it's not adding the class name, so no, it is not working
[21:07:16] <BillCriswell> but I can't tell what I'm supposed to be dragging.
[21:08:03] <aquaguy> BillCriswell: I don't want to show the helper, the helper is 8 x 8px squeare in the tip of the cursor
[21:08:22] <Larado> hi, can some1 tell me why in the type ahead of the search if you type about 20 chars it pops up an error, /Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined/   http://bit.ly/1tG4JnV  also after the search results appear if you move the mouse it dissapears
[21:08:23] <aquaguy> You just drag the "dark" bar next to Editor or Panel#1
[21:08:35] <aquaguy> on top of the other panel.
[21:13:06] <BillCriswell> aquaguy: http://jsfiddle.net/neemb6bz/ here it is without everything else going on, so those things do work.
[21:15:00] <Technodrome> what are the top jquery libraries for scroll events?
[21:15:40] <BillCriswell> Larado: The issue seems to occur when there's no more matches in the type ahead, so that should help narrow i down.
[21:16:33] <Larado> BillCriswell if you type 1 letter, say 'a' then move around the suggestions go away, if it doesnt do it just make a search and try again
[21:16:46] <Larado> the first time you enter the page it might work as expected
[21:17:54] <aquaguy> BillCriswell: So, it does not work http://jsfiddle.net/neemb6bz/1/
[21:18:41] <shoky> aquaguy: jquery doesn't support svg DOM
[21:18:41] <aquaguy> The class is not being added when the element is a svg tag
[21:19:06] <aquaguy> well... then that explains it
[21:19:11] <shoky> http://contribute.jquery.org/wont-fix/#svg-vml-or-namespaced-elements-bugs
[21:20:36] <BillCriswell> You'd need to use classList or modify that attribute it seems.
[21:20:46] <aquaguy> anyway I was just trying to add a class name to a svg tag, no it's childrens. jQuery should be able to add a class to whatever tag <div>, <span>, <acustomtag> or <svg>. Imo
[21:20:49] <shoky> or use an svg lib
[21:21:52] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/neemb6bz/2/ wee
[21:21:57] <BillCriswell> aquaguy: YEah I dunno.
[21:22:27] <aquaguy> Yep, thank you
[21:23:34] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[21:44:53] <vx> BillCriswell any idea why the typeahead results go away ?
[21:45:32] <Larado> guess not
[21:45:39] <Larado> well if anyone else is around
[21:46:06] <Larado> can some1 tell me why in the type ahead of the search if you type about 20 chars it pops up an error, /Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined/   http://bit.ly/1tG4JnV  also after the search results appear if you move the mouse it dissapears
[23:01:44] <nathaneltitane> anyone here for a quick question?
[23:02:10] <nathaneltitane> BillCriswell, still in here?
