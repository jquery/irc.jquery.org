[00:43:08] <djQuery> how do you get all the previous siblings?
[00:43:44] <djQuery> .siblings gets all the siblings I just want the ones before the selected item
[00:44:06] <djQuery> .seen systemfault
[00:44:07] <hsbot> systemfault was seen 2 hours, 29 minutes and 4 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: I don't know :/
[00:50:20] <djQuery> ?prevuntil
[00:50:21] <bot-t> .prevUntil([selector]): Get all preceding siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/prevUntil/

[01:14:36] <Lampoon> Sorry, I haven't seen madmonkey.
[01:16:10] <rosco_y> I have my tutorial "app" compiling and running, but my jquery is not working: http://paste2.org/p/1499092, can you help?
[01:30:56] <muzone_> At my price range slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01o - I tried to split the high and low prices up into seperate inputs so I could put one to the left and one to the right, but that didn't go so well - http://www.webdevout.net/test?026 - what have I done wrong?
[01:32:29] <muzone_> versatiletech :)
[01:32:37] <muzone_> whats good my man??
[01:32:42] <versatiletech> woah
[01:32:52] <versatiletech> who is you!? ;)
[01:33:05] <versatiletech> I'm just about to bust a cap in a clinet
[01:33:07] <versatiletech> client*
[01:33:07] <muzone_> a troubled young man i say
[01:33:15] <muzone_> haha
[01:33:16] <versatiletech> j/k
[01:33:28] <muzone_> yo, you mind taking a look at something for me?
[01:33:32] <versatiletech> sure
[01:33:37] <muzone_> aaaah
[01:33:39] <muzone_> much obliged!
[01:33:43] <muzone_> At my price range slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01o - I tried to split the high and low prices up into seperate inputs so I could put one to the left and one to the right, but that didn't go so well - http://www.webdevout.net/test?026 - what have I done wrong?
[01:35:07] <versatiletech> isn't a slider supposed to be one element, not two?
[01:35:35] <versatiletech> I mean that's the intention of slider. Why do you want to split into two inputs?
[01:35:46] <muzone_> yes it is!
[01:35:58] <muzone_> actually its just the price range im trying to split up in two
[01:36:26] <versatiletech> why though?
[01:36:32] <muzone_> which comes before the slider, but the way i tried to do the js is fucked up because i dont know js that well
[01:36:54] <versatiletech> do you want two sliders?
[01:37:06] <versatiletech> for two different ranges?
[01:37:25] <muzone_> just one slider
[01:37:33] <muzone_> but i want to be able to control the low price and high price location with css
[01:37:51] <muzone_> i wanna do something like http://www.asos.com/Women/Skirts/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=2639
[01:38:55] <versatiletech> ok, so what you should me here http://www.webdevout.net/test?01o
[01:39:03] <versatiletech> that's the same as that slider
[01:39:28] <versatiletech> btw, http://www.webdevout.net/test?026 has a syntax error
[01:39:58] <versatiletech> try using jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com to test jquery, they are much more responsive
[01:40:18] <versatiletech> at if you can set up your own local development environment, even better
[01:40:23] <versatiletech> and if*
[01:41:03] <muzone_> what is the syntax error?
[01:41:56] <versatiletech> $("#price_low").val("$" + $("#slider_range").slider("values", 0);
[01:42:07] <versatiletech> $("#price_low").val("$" + $("#slider_range").slider("values", 0) );
[01:42:37] <versatiletech> http://www.webdevout.net/test?026
[01:43:06] <muzone_> i know thats where the syntax error is
[01:43:11] <muzone_> thats the part i tried modifying
[01:43:26] <muzone_> i mean like
[01:43:33] <muzone_> do you know how i can fix it?
[01:43:55] <versatiletech> muzone_: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[01:44:25] <versatiletech> you missed an ending parenthesis
[01:44:39] <versatiletech> http://www.webdevout.net/test?028
[01:44:43] <muzone_> thats it??
[01:44:49] <muzone_> nice book btw
[01:44:58] <versatiletech> read it
[01:45:00] <versatiletech> it's a must
[01:45:10] <muzone_> thanks man :))
[01:46:01] <versatiletech> may I PM you?
[01:46:36] <muzone_> yes go ahead
[01:46:43] <muzone_> damn i cant believe my code was actually good
[01:46:49] <muzone_> apart from the end parenthesis!
[01:47:04] <muzone_> versatiletech: do accept http://www.zshare.net/download/552763591f4802ce/ as a token of my appreciation for your support!
[01:47:37] <versatiletech> what is it? A virus? ;)
[01:50:18] <muzone_> mp3 mixtape by "your favorite producer's favorite producer"
[01:50:31] <muzone_> pretty decent stuff
[01:53:04] <djQuery> muzone_: in your link you forgot to include a link to jquery.ui.js
[01:53:46] <muzone_> djQuery: it should be there, at the bottom
[01:53:46] <djQuery> or am I too late hadnt scrolled
[01:53:52] <muzone_> hehe yes you are =))
[01:55:37] <djQuery> muzone_: why dont you save a little space and make it look like this. or do you want the peple to be able to edit the price manualy. http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#range
[01:56:06] <muzone_> djQuery: its based on http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#range actually
[01:56:42] <muzone_> and like i just said i just wanna be able to put the lowest price all the way to the left and the highest price all the way to the right
[01:58:37] <muzone_> but its cool, we fixed the problem
[01:58:48] <djQuery> ok how would I go about removing a comment from a div? <!--tmpl(Columns()) _2--><!--item-->
[01:59:05] <djQuery> stupid jsviews
[01:59:24] <djQuery> actualy it in a tbody
[02:54:37] <Topias> Can anyone say why a text input will return a different value when jquery autocomplete is used title is checked mouse or tab key? My code is similar with this example: http://www.mix26.com/demo/ajax-autocomplete/test.php Values of cases are like Test and ?test. It's hard to reproduce, but somehow in some words this happend. I'm using UTF-8 charset in mysql and in a web page
[03:08:58] <versatiletech> djQuery: use regex?
[03:20:16] <Engin> JQ rocks so much, it is moving, unbelievable
[03:28:09] <codebeaker> is there some go-to plugin for doing smart timing on autocomplete lookups?
[03:28:17] <codebeaker> something like hoverintent, but like "search intent" ?
[03:47:31] <rns> anyone know why my jqui button would work on full page reloads, but lose all formatting after submitting the form and reloading it via ajax?
[04:11:06] <verynew> hello everyone
[04:11:54] <Northwoods> hellow verynew
[04:13:06] <verynew> i'm doing some drag and drop with selectors , i dont know if this line is correct or not "appendTo appendTo: "#field1 , #field2 , #field3 , #field4"| where i can drop it
[04:13:26] <verynew> i dont know if there is any other way to do that please if you can guide me
[04:24:30] <shkiper> who did make a really complex widget?
[04:26:44] <Woet> ?ask @ shkiper
[04:26:45] <bot-t> shkiper, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:27:10] <shkiper> Woet, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/grid-and-a-draggable-element
[04:44:03] <muzone_> Yesterday my friend Vaerros helped improve my jQuery UI Slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01m into http://jsfiddle.net/ZPAZB - but I was left with some very complicated CSS - does anyone know how to simplify it (going through hell right now trying to resize the handlers etc.):
[04:44:07] <muzone_> <muzone_> what do you mean the math is a bit tricky though?
[04:44:10] <muzone_> <Vaerros> it's a formula to get it, basically, like
[04:44:13] <muzone_> <Vaerros> text-indent: -[inner span width]
[04:44:15] <muzone_> <Vaerros> or .ui-slider-handle margin-top is -(.ui-slider handle height / 2)
[04:44:18] <muzone_> <Vaerros> although the .ui-slider-range alters that value a bit
[04:44:20] <muzone_> <Vaerros> (and the extra 4px from the padding)
[04:44:23] <muzone_> Pretty messed up right?
[04:49:04] <Rainerbird> Hi, I'm having a bit of a tricky problem with the tumblr api. I am currently getting every tag from all my posts and storing it in an array. However that means that if an array is used more than once it doubles up. I want to be able to just store a tag once only and also store how many times it's appeared. Any ideas? I was thinking an object array would work. Here's my current js: http://jsfiddle.net/k2UML/
[05:06:23] <silo> Anyone know why i might get distrotion on elements as they fadein/out - only in IE
[05:06:31] <silo> see here: http://www.zeroscale.co.uk/v3/
[05:06:39] <coldhead> bot-t: tell Rainerbird thanks for waiting around for your answer, jerk
[05:06:39] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[05:06:41] <silo> driving me nuts...
[05:07:52] <coldhead> i don't have IE to test sorry silo
[05:08:02] <silo> np
[05:08:14] <silo> wise move :)
[05:18:10] <coldhead> can no one help a widow's son?
[05:19:33] <dr0id> lolwut
[05:19:37] <dr0id> haha coldhead
[05:19:42] <dr0id> whose the unfortunate guy ? :(
[05:20:06] <dismist> ha
[05:20:14] <dismist> too funny
[05:21:23] <coldhead> silo needs some IE love
[05:21:33] <coldhead> SOMEONE MUST HAVE IE
[05:22:48] <NielsMob> i have ;)
[05:22:58] <NielsMob> Not sure how i can help hem :(
[05:23:25] <dr0id> heh
[05:27:20] <NielsMob> silo what is the problem exactly, i have not much JQ knowledge. but maybe i can do some goods ;)
[05:27:39] <coldhead> Rainerbird: you came back
[05:28:08] <fotoflo> hey all. quick question: http://kuaibbs.com/jsfun/popup.html -- everything seems to work, onmousedown a div pops up, when a user mouses over that div and releases it runs a console.log() -- this seems to work.  However, if you mouseover (while mousedown) several times, and then mouseup over the div, console.log will run several timesâ€¦  what sup?
[05:28:12] <Rainerbird> colhead: yep
[05:28:12] <bot-t> (21 mins 30 secs ago) <coldhead> tell Rainerbird thanks for waiting around for your answer, jerk
[05:28:35] <coldhead> Rainerbird: http://jsfiddle.net/k2UML/1/
[05:28:40] <Rainerbird> sorry my battery ran out
[05:28:49] <coldhead>                     allTags[tag]++;
[05:28:57] <coldhead> that should do the trick
[05:29:14] <Rainerbird> thanks coldhead a lot, really appreciated
[05:29:19] <coldhead> Rainerbird: you were on;y a jerk if you never got that message, sorry :)
[05:29:47] <Rainerbird> no worries that's fine :)
[05:30:17] <coldhead> it's not fine, i said something i regret AND I CAN NEVER TAKE IT BACK
[05:30:57] <coldhead> fotoflo: is that really something someone might do? :(
[05:31:08] <fotoflo> coldhead: of course
[05:31:15] <fotoflo> if they miss and come back
[05:31:21] <fotoflo> it will run the function tice
[05:31:23] <fotoflo> twice
[05:31:33] <coldhead> oh i see
[05:31:48] <fotoflo> or so it appears
[05:32:15] <fotoflo> of course i am only writing this as a demo, and i will integrate it into other code later
[05:32:25] <coldhead> um i don't really understand the cause but maybe you can use ?ba debounce
[05:32:26] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery hashchange event | jQuery Plugins - This jQuery plugin enables very basic bookmarkable #hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-hashchange-plugin
[05:32:34] <coldhead> THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT THING BOT-T
[05:32:43] <coldhead> ?g ben alman debounce plugin
[05:32:44] <bot-t> coldhead, Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[05:32:54] <coldhead> that guy ^^
[05:33:05] <coldhead> bye forever, Rainerbird
[05:33:09] <coldhead> i will never forget you
[05:33:57] <coldhead> it looks like the mouseover events queue up until the mouse button is released
[05:34:08] <coldhead> which is probably some workaround for drag and drop
[05:34:17] <fotoflo> probably right
[05:34:23] <fotoflo> debounce looks good
[05:34:32] <coldhead> ben alman is pretty wonderful
[05:34:52] <coldhead> he's usually solved most people's problems already
[05:35:09] <coldhead> but he hasn't taught me how to love
[05:35:49] <Segaja> hi, is there a way to check if the height of a div/span is higher than one row?
[05:36:56] <coldhead> $('div').outerHeight() > $('tr').outerHeight() ?
[05:37:45] <Segaja> sry, my bad
[05:37:55] <Segaja> i have a span in a sort of calendar
[05:38:09] <Segaja> and i want to "correct" the span if it has more than one line of writing high
[05:39:03] <Segaja> to give an example: http://e-tunes.net/releases
[05:39:49] <coldhead> oh this is too hard for me sorry Segaja
[05:39:56] <coldhead> it's only my first day using jQuery
[05:39:59] <coldhead> good luck!
[05:40:13] <dismist> blessed be the widow's son
[05:40:20] <Vorspire> lmao
[05:40:40] <Vorspire> nothing has changed in the months I see :)
[05:41:27] <dismist> dude sounds fit for a pink straight jacket
[05:42:06] <fotoflo> coldhead: pretty awesome that he did that in like 3 lines of codeâ€¦.
[05:42:35] <Vorspire> but the entire jquery library can be put on one line :S
[05:43:10] <dismist> why pick upon the widow's son
[05:43:29] <coldhead> t only takes three commands to install gentoo through a command line.
[05:43:41] <coldhead> cfdisk /dev/hda && mkfs.xfs /dev/hda1 && mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/gentoo/ && chroot /mnt/gentoo/ && env-update && . /etc/profile && emerge sync && cd /usr/portage && scripts/bootsrap.sh && emerge system && emerge vim && vi /etc/fstab && emerge gentoo-dev-sources && cd /usr/src/linux && make menuconfig && make install modules_install && emerge gnome mozilla-firefox openoffice && emerge grub && cp /boot/grub/grub.conf.samp le
[05:43:41] <coldhead> /boot/grub/grub.conf && vi /boot/grub/grub.conf && grub && init 6
[05:43:46] <coldhead> that's the first line
[05:43:54] <Segaja> is there an event that is fired if the content fo an element (span / div) is word-wraped?
[05:44:24] <coldhead> i don't think so, Segaja
[05:46:30] <fotoflo> coldhead: deb ounce is throng me an error
[05:46:35] <fotoflo> debounce
[05:46:46] <coldhead> it shouldn't do that >: \
[05:46:53] <fotoflo> no
[05:46:54] <fotoflo> odd
[05:46:59] <coldhead> can you paste up at jsfiddle?
[05:47:10] <coldhead> or link to demo or such like?
[05:47:16] <fotoflo> 		$(this).mouseup(function(e){$.debounce( 250, console.log("nailed it"));});
[05:47:26] <fotoflo> hold on ill reupload
[05:47:57] <fotoflo> (working locally
[05:48:21] <fotoflo> http://kuaibbs.com/jsfun/popup.html
[05:48:41] <coldhead> you want more like function(e){$.debounce(250, function () {console.log("nailed it")})}
[05:48:59] <coldhead> the second parameter needs to be a function
[05:49:04] <coldhead> not a call to a function
[05:49:13] <fotoflo> actually i see that happen a lot
[05:49:16] <coldhead> (unless that call returns a function, which console.log('whatever') doesn't
[05:49:17] <fotoflo> and i never get it
[05:49:27] <coldhead> it's just an anonymous function
[05:49:33] <coldhead> javascript loves them
[05:49:45] <fotoflo> like with event handlers they make you use anon functions when you could just call a regular one
[05:49:46] <coldhead> you COULD create a function nailed_it() {...}
[05:49:46] <fotoflo> why?
[05:49:59] <coldhead> and then later write debounce(20, nailed_it)
[05:50:12] <coldhead> but then i have to look elsewhere to see what nailed_it is
[05:50:22] <coldhead> if you put it inline it's all in the same place
[05:50:38] <fotoflo> i fixed it
[05:50:40] <fotoflo> thanks
[05:50:46] <coldhead> you can use regular functions if you prefer
[05:50:51] <Vorspire> anonymous functions prevent the need for extra overhead in creating functions, there's no need to use a named function unless more than one application or feature uses that function.
[05:50:51] <fotoflo> but back to the question - why do i see this kind of thing all over the place
[05:50:55] <coldhead> but if you only need to use it once...
[05:51:01] <fotoflo> console.log() is a function, no?
[05:51:11] <coldhead> it's a function call
[05:51:20] <fotoflo> $("body").mouseup(function(e){		dropTheDiv(e)	});
[05:51:40] <Vorspire> console.log only exists in firebug too, IE won't work AFAIK?
[05:51:40] <fotoflo> i had to do that, but it would make more not to do the anon function and just drop the div
[05:51:48] <fotoflo> fuck ie
[05:51:53] <Vorspire> exactly!
[05:51:54] <fotoflo> I'm using chrome
[05:52:19] <fotoflo> ie is not a target browser for anything i am writing
[05:52:31] <coldhead> fotoflo: you can just use dropTheDiv IF the function doesn't need any parameters
[05:52:40] <Vorspire> IE shouldn't be a target browser for anything :S
[05:52:57] <coldhead> mouseup(droptheDiv) is fine, it will do that when you mouseup
[05:53:15] <coldhead> mouseup(dropTheDiv(e)) will call that function IMMEDIATELY
[05:53:16] <fotoflo> droptheDiv  != droptheDiv()
[05:53:56] <coldhead> if you want to provide a function for mouseup to use later you have to use mouseup(functioon () {dropTheDiv(e)})
[05:54:01] <fotoflo> a function , not a function call
[05:54:13] <coldhead> which gives you the fn back without actually calling dropTheDiv() yet
[05:54:14] <coldhead> yeah
[05:54:27] <fotoflo> this is the key distinction
[05:54:30] <coldhead> you might need to think about it for a while to get the hang of it but that's the general idea
[05:55:01] <coldhead> it's the use/mention distinction in linguistics, if you swing that way
[05:55:04] <coldhead> (weirdo)
[05:55:17] <fotoflo> so console.log(function) will print the function and console.log(function()) will print the return value, right?
[05:55:27] <coldhead> yes!
[05:55:29] <coldhead> bam!
[05:55:35] <fotoflo> ok
[05:55:38] <fotoflo> gotcha
[05:55:39] <coldhead> man that is a nice summary
[05:55:55] <coldhead> console.log(function_name, function_name()) captures it nicely
[05:56:16] <fotoflo> is there anything else?
[05:56:31] <fotoflo> like console.log("function_name") or something crazy?
[05:56:32] <coldhead> closures are the next thing to get your head around
[05:56:37] <coldhead> haha
[05:56:43] <coldhead> that's a matter for yourself
[05:56:50] <coldhead> these sleeping pills are kicking in
[05:57:10] <fotoflo> ok coldhead, feel better
[05:57:13] <coldhead> goodnight kids
[05:57:13] <fotoflo> my problem is solved
[05:57:20] <fotoflo> and allz is well
[05:58:33] <Vorspire> idd :)
[05:59:12] <Vorspire> ?eval var func = function(){ return [1,2,3]; }; print(func); print(' | '); print( func() );
[05:59:13] <bot-t> Vorspire: <function () {return [1, 2, 3];}>" | "[1, 2, 3]
[06:07:53] <verynew> how can i make a .droppable() accepts many draggable selectors ?
[06:08:10] <verynew> but not all
[06:11:29] <fotoflo> oh no, i found the one more thing that cold head and I were just talking about:  setTimeout( "popTheDiv(e)", 3000);
[06:11:38] <fotoflo> why does it require the quotes/
[06:11:40] <fotoflo> ?
[06:11:54] <fotoflo> (and how do i pass the e in?
[06:12:10] <fotoflo> oh again it takes a function name?
[06:12:13] <Vorspire> "popTheDiv(" + e + ")"
[06:13:35] <fotoflo> Vorspire: okâ€¦. again, why?
[06:13:38] <Vorspire> Pretty sure setTimeout takes an object as an argument, as long as it's a function reference, you don't need to give it a string
[06:14:16] <fotoflo> setTimeout( function(e){popTheDiv(e)}, 1000);  i did this, and the function ran but didn't get passed
[06:14:17] <fotoflo> e
[06:14:52] <Vorspire> is "e" available in thew scope before you call setTimeout?
[06:15:29] <fotoflo> 	setTimeout( "popTheDiv("+ e +")" , 1000);  -- unexpected idenitfier
[06:15:39] <fotoflo> i believe so
[06:15:52] <fotoflo> if i don't setTimeout popTheDiv(e) works fine

[06:17:22] <Vorspire> fotoflo do you have to do a lot of work with setTimeout?
[06:17:49] <fotoflo> I'm just teaching myself javascript and delays seem to come up a lot
[06:18:22] <Vorspire> yes they do, really depends on the context
[06:20:02] <Vorspire> anyway, I guess whatever you put as the first argument to setTimeout is processed by JS with eval, so it runs the argument as code, this means it's not dedicated to oly accepting a function as an argument and therefore your "e" value is never defined since setTimeout doesn't know that it needs an argument to be passed.
[06:20:40] <fotoflo> so i have a mousedown and then a popup appears, i want to delay that appearance for 150ms, and if i get a mouseup event then cancel popup
[06:21:09] <fotoflo> so i have to make that e global?
[06:21:23] <fotoflo> (thats a good explanation, btw, thanks)
[06:21:55] <muzone_> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?0L&raw - how do I properly center that box that appears behind my slide buttons when hovering them?
[06:22:39] <Vorspire> fotoflo, as long as "e" exists before setTimeout, you should be able to do this:
[06:22:39] <Vorspire> var e = "Hello World"; setTimeout( function(){ print(e); }, 1000 );
[06:24:04] <fotoflo> $("#callToAction").mousedown(function(e){setTimeout( function(){ debugger; popTheDiv(e); }, 1000);});   -  e is undefined
[06:24:26] <fotoflo> when i drop into the debugger
[06:25:58] <verynew> thanks i already figured it out
[06:26:08] <Vorspire> In that scope, "e" would be the event args object and that code looks valid :S
[06:26:19] <fotoflo> odd
[06:26:21] <fotoflo> it works now
[06:26:27] <fotoflo> cache i guess
[06:26:30] <muzone_> The more I change .ui-slider-handle's padding and margin, the more text-indent gets shoved off the grid, and the more I change text-indent, the more the padding and margin gets shoved off the grid. It's like a lose-lose situation.
[06:26:31] <fotoflo> thanks!
[06:26:34] <Vorspire> hehe
[06:26:57] <Vorspire> fotoflo, alternatively, if you're going to be doing a lot of work with timers, I recommend looking at:

[06:27:57] <kurisu> hi guys, Im having some issues with overflow when using hide('slide') example at http://jsfiddle.net/gD5SL/
[06:28:11] <muzone_> kurisu: Wait for your turn
[06:29:35] <kurisu> basically I dont want the overflow in the 'membersLinks' div to be shown when the slide animation is running, so that the links div slides in nicely
[06:29:50] <fotoflo> I'm writing a minesweeper and had to deal with single-click issue so i wanted to build this function firstâ€¦. its built and working and now I'm going to drop it in my minesweeperâ€¦ good to know about timer-X  ill check it out next time i need one
[06:29:55] <fotoflo> thanks!
[06:30:04] <Vorspire> kurisu, $(".membersLinksTab").hide(); ? typo
[06:30:10] <Vorspire> change it to that, sorry
[06:31:01] <kurisu> Vorspire: no typo I think
[06:31:29] <kurisu> Vorspire: unless theres something I'm not seeing
[06:31:41] <Vorspire> try changing ".membersLinks" to ".membersLinksTab" and test :)
[06:32:11] <Vorspire> unless I read your question wrong, that should do what you want?
[06:32:59] <kurisu> Vorspire: I want the .membersLinkTab shown at all times though
[06:32:59] <staar2> hello
[06:33:18] <staar2> is there any good cross browser watcher ?
[06:33:37] <kurisu> Vorspire: I just dont want the ugly text wrapping as the slide animation is in progress
[06:33:51] <muzone_> Vorspire: I'll give you http://media.brainfeedersite.com/podcast/martynmix1 if you help me out
[06:34:02] <kurisu> Vorspire: text in .membersLinks
[06:34:28] * muzone_ is now playing http://media.brainfeedersite.com/podcast/martynmix1
[06:34:58] <Vorspire> kurisu, sorry i have to go now, if you've not fixed it when I'm back, I'll take a look at it properly
[06:35:16] <Vorspire> that podcast is pretty cool :) the drop of the bass on my woofer is shaking the floor
[06:35:33] <kurisu> Vorspire: ok no problem, thanks
[06:35:36] <muzone_> pleases me to hear bruh
[06:36:10] <fotoflo> oh no. something tells me this isn't going to work...
[06:38:30] <fotoflo> Vorspire: http://pastebin.com/j5rupyL4   <--- this is totally wrong â€¦ any hints?

[08:21:47] <oDesk> people how would twitter cache the ajax requestes ?
[08:22:05] <jbrokc> would an element gaining "focus" trigger the onClick event?
[08:22:06] <oDesk> while twitter using jQuery
[08:22:11] <jbrokc> or is that literally, only when I use the mouse to click an element
[08:22:38] <oDesk> into the firebug Net tab the request to the same row would not go twice, i want to achive this mannar
[08:22:47] <oDesk> into my script
[08:22:56] <oDesk> i'm using $.post()
[08:23:08] <Krambfhase> jbrokc:  would an element gaining "focus" trigger the onClick event? << not. by tabbing through the page you trigger focus events. but not clicks
[08:23:39] <jbrokc> Krambfhase: shit. I don't like to use my mouse and many input fields only activate autocompletion boxes on onClick, not when I focus them
[08:25:59] <oDesk> seems like $.post() doesn't cache but $.get() maybe cache

[08:35:00] <jgarbers> i have an ajax service that returns JSON-encoded data for both successful results (like 200) as well as errors (like 400).  It appears that jQuery isn't doing its Content-Type-based conversion to JSON data in the case of a non-200 result code. I can do it myself, but how can I ensure that the Content-Type on the error is application/json and not something else (as might happen if a server or proxy was down)?

[08:42:13] <dinosaadeh> hi guys, i am setting a javascript variable with html template code as to append it to another element.. and before doing so, I cutomize the content $(tempHtmlTemplate).find('#imageThumb').css('background-image', 'url(bla bla bla)')                but this is not taking effect! any idea how i can do this?
[08:43:49] <Kambfhase> dinosaadeh: save the result
[08:44:42] <dinosaadeh> Kambfhase: ummm meaning? tempHtmlTemplate = $(tempHtmlTemplate).find('#imageThumb').css('background-image', 'url(bla bla bla)')?
[08:44:50] <Kambfhase> yeah!
[08:45:14] <dinosaadeh> gonna give it a try but i think this will assign tempHtmlTemplate to the imageThumb
[08:50:44] <level09> is there a quick api function to clean a string ? (remove \n \t \r etc ..)

[09:15:22] <rosco_y> :) thanks for being here :)
[09:25:03] <Whirl3d> I keep finding myself needing some features that deal with a jquery collection as a whole, things like summing attribute values or finding the max or min attribute value in a collection. Does anybody know of any plugins that do this kind of thing? Or should I make one and would someone be willing to help?
[09:25:11] <dabear> rosco_y: no problem :)
[09:25:12] <dabear> :D
[09:26:00] <dabear> Whirl3d: that is trivially easy to do with .map or .each
[09:26:57] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I have been doing that currently. Not so much with .map, but I use .each constantly. I would just like to be able to use the line: var totalHeight=$(".items").totalHeight();
[09:27:18] <Whirl3d> or better yet $(".items").total("height");
[09:27:39] <Whirl3d> as well as $(".items").min("left") for the leftmost item
[09:28:02] <dabear> leftmost?

[09:28:16] <Whirl3d> yeah
[09:28:29] <Whirl3d> For aligning elements
[09:28:41] <dabear> Whirl3d: make your self a plugin then
[09:28:58] <rosco_y> Can anyone tell me is it preferable t o use http to a jQuery source, rather than use a local copy, for any reason?

[09:30:28] <rosco_y> (I'm a newbie)
[09:30:28] <Whirl3d> yeah
[09:30:48] <rosco_y> and I suppose you can read the screen dimension their
[09:30:57] <rosco_y> yuck, there
[09:30:57] <Whirl3d> yeah, and jquery binds easily to it, it's just hard to get a lot of elements to do what I want them to do
[09:31:11] <rosco_y> I can almost imagine
[09:31:15] <rosco_y> lots of code to write
[09:31:40] <rosco_y> are you using PHP?
[09:31:56] <Whirl3d> no, jQuery/javascript
[09:32:00] <rosco_y> :)
[09:32:06] <rosco_y> yeah
[09:32:28] <rosco_y> I haven't even thought of resizing yet...joy joy
[09:32:57] <rosco_y> well, if it was too easy, everyone would be doing their own stuff, and then we wouldn't have work.
[09:33:17] <rosco_y> but yuck, just the same
[09:33:59] <rosco_y> Whirl3d: I almost think there's an opportunity knocking--write a library for resizing pages.

[09:52:02] <bot-t> rosco_y, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:53:23] <Whirl3d> the jQuery api browser is flash based?
[09:53:32] <Whirl3d> or just air-based
[09:54:01] <rosco_y> Krambfhase: Thanks--I appreciate that!
[09:56:47] <rosco_y> Krambfhase: was the comment saying something about the reason the <script src=http://ajax.googleapis.com/.../jquery.min.js></script> ?
[09:57:33] <rosco_y> sorry, was the comment explaining why the local and google's src's were both included?
[09:58:03] <rosco_y> (I'm not having a problem with PreventDefault().
[09:58:40] <rosco_y> Right now, I'm trying to understand if it's sufficient to simply include a reference to my local copy of jQuery.js
[09:59:04] <muzone_> thanks Kambfhase :D
[09:59:08] <muzone_> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?02c&raw - how do I make the high and low prices follow their respective slide buttons? And to position themselves on their ends when their buttons are too far away? Like on Topshop.com: http://tinyurl.com/6fvb3fw
[10:00:08] <rosco_y> muzone_: it seems to be working fine for me
[10:00:35] <rosco_y> I like it, I"ve never seen a slider used this way
[10:00:57] <muzone_> thanks rosco_y
[10:01:12] <muzone_> Yup, it's finally working, but I'd love to make it more like the topshop.com one..
[10:01:16] <muzone_> did you see it?
[10:01:37] <rosco_y> I"m loading it now
[10:01:47] <muzone_> almost identical
[10:01:58] <rosco_y> I'm at topshop, but I don't see it
[10:02:16] <muzone_> rosco_y: its in the side menu there..
[10:02:51] <rosco_y> ok, gotcha
[10:03:04] <Anon422> !seen JPNyt
[10:03:06] <Whirl3d> muzone, nice that it's keyboard enabled as well
[10:03:07] <rosco_y> so you want the numbers to follow the slider
[10:03:32] <rosco_y> That is nice
[10:03:33] <muzone_> Whirl3d: a little bit of magic there;)
[10:03:44] <rosco_y> so you always see the max, min, and current values
[10:03:49] <muzone_> rosco_y: Yes indeed if that's not too much work
[10:03:56] <muzone_> exactly man !!
[10:03:58] <muzone_> you got it
[10:05:28] <rosco_y> I'm new to jQuery.  when you write a plugin, can you extend the existing "slider()"?
[10:06:03] <rosco_y> or maybe you need to modify a local copy of the src
[10:06:05] <djQuery> yes
[10:06:27] <rosco_y> djQuery: yes, you can extend the existing slider?
[10:06:34] <djQuery> rosco_y: http://davidjquery.com/?p=9
[10:07:22] <rosco_y> djQuery: awesome--just a bit over my head right now, I'm just learning to crawl
[10:07:32] <rosco_y> but that's great news.
[10:07:38] <djQuery> rosco_y: see ?jqf
[10:07:39] <bot-t> rosco_y, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[10:08:16] <Whirl3d> Is there an easy way to determine if a string passed to a function represents an attribute name, property name, css property name?
[10:08:31] <rosco_y> djQuery: Thank you so much, I really needed these docs :)
[10:09:00] <djQuery> rosco_y: there is also a more javascript referenve see ?101
[10:09:01] <bot-t> rosco_y, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:09:49] <djQuery> Whirl3d: well theres $.type() but all those would equate to string
[10:09:59] <dagon666> I would like to clone dd and dt elementsand append them to the end of dl. Howto append them in one time ? If I do fadeIn('slow').appendTo() - they do not appear at the same time
[10:10:56] <rosco_y> djQuery: another great site.  I'm bookmarking all of this
[10:11:19] <Kambfhase> dagon666: try .hide().appendTo( foo).fadeIn('slow')
[10:13:04] <dagon666> also if I append an id="last" to both dd and dt and try to clone them with var.tmp = $('#last').clone(); and then append I see that only dt is appended. Should I appendit with each() function ?
[10:13:28] <rosco_y> what would we do without the internet...
[10:13:47] <Kambfhase> ?valid id @ dagon666
[10:13:47] <bot-t> dagon666, ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[10:14:02] <rosco_y> we'd all be sitting in our little caves punching out the same code over and over again, probably
[10:14:15] <Whirl3d> <--i remember those days
[10:14:34] <dagon666> Kambfhase: will the situation be any better if I choose class instead of id ?
[10:14:47] <Kambfhase> yes
[10:14:58] <dagon666> Kambfhase: ok, I'll try. Thanks
[10:15:00] <rosco_y> I love jQuery, I'm all about using amazing, tested and free code.
[10:15:32] <rosco_y> I'm well on my way now, thanks djQuery!!  The world would be a better place if there were more of you!
[10:16:07] <dagon666> Kambfhase: it works, thanks
[10:16:16] <Kambfhase> :)
[10:17:25] <Whirl3d> in $.fn.someFunction=function (i,elm) {    the term  'this' refers to the jquery object itself?
[10:18:07] <Kambfhase> indeed
[10:18:52] <Camer0n> hello, if you go to the bottom of http://spareslist.com/listing.php?id=56 , it will say like "item 1 - 6pts" when you tick the box next to it I want it to add it to the total offered points which is displayed next to What you will offer
[10:19:30] <Camer0n> so it will look like "What you will offer - 12pts" if two 6pts items are selected
[10:21:50] <Iarfen> hi
[10:22:18] <Iarfen> the ajax sends me back the html content of the page and not the content of the .php file requested, how i can fix it?
[10:22:37] <Kambfhase> Camer0n: i dont see no box, nor "item 1"
[10:23:14] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Iarfen
[10:23:14] <bot-t> Iarfen, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:23:22] <Camer0n> oh sorry, you have to be logged in, 1 sec
[10:23:40] <Camer0n> now you should see it
[10:23:46] <Camer0n> Kambfhase
[10:23:59] <Camer0n> right at the bottom under make an offer
[10:24:16] <Iarfen> Kambfhase: the error is not on the code, when I upload the files on a remote server it works, but on my local machine i doesn't work
[10:24:52] <Iarfen> Kambfhase: I think the problem is something related to the server, it's a unusual bug
[10:26:23] <djQuery> rosco_y: my wife says there is too much of me allready
[10:26:54] <tucan> Hi, I'm getting an error in firebug saying requiredfield is not defined
[10:27:01] <tucan> what does this usually mean?
[10:27:35] <Whirl3d> so, inside $.fn.function =   $(this)[0] returns an element, right? So I would have to use $($(this)[0]) to use jquery methods on that element, right or wrong?
[10:28:11] <djQuery> ?.get
[10:28:12] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/

[10:28:52] <Whirl3d> brilliant, thanks
[10:28:53] <djQuery> or just $(this).each if your building a plugin. Whirl3d
[10:29:33] <Whirl3d> i am trying to test a single item for .attr(str) or .css(str) to deteremine which value is needed
[10:29:34] <Acorn> When you create a jQuery object from a html string, is the javascritp evaluated?
[10:29:47] <Camer0n> hello, if you go to the bottom of http://spareslist.com/listing.php?id=56 , it will say like "item 1 - 6pts" when you tick the box next to it I want it to add it to the total offered points which is displayed next to What you will offer
[10:29:47] <Acorn> And if so, is there a way to stop that from happening?
[10:29:48] <cook1es> hi! im wondering what the syntax is for css selecting 2 different html attributes. I have currently got this code: $('td[bgcolor*="#d9dde0"]') and want to also select the style attribute of td within the same selection
[10:29:49] <Camer0n> so it will look like "What you will offer - 12pts" if two 6pts items are selected
[10:29:50] <smykes24> I'm having issues with dropout
[10:31:06] <smykes24> $("td").css("background", "#d9dde0");
[10:31:16] <smykes24> im nost sure wat you are asking in the second part
[10:31:25] <Dambfhase> Camer0n: register change event handlers for the boxes, get the points, add them and display the sum.
[10:31:39] <Camer0n> uhm how?
[10:31:45] <smykes24> @cook1es
[10:31:48] <Camer0n> Dambfhase
[10:32:54] <imsky> loal
[10:33:21] <cook1es> smykes24: Putting it simple, I want to select a td element with bgcolor=#d9dde0 and style=color: red;
[10:33:33] <smykes24> oh
[10:33:44] <smykes24> so you want to find a td with those attributes?
[10:33:49] <cook1es> yes
[10:34:11] <smykes24> hrm you would need and if statement hold on
[10:34:14] <smykes24> let me cook something up
[10:34:32] <smykes24> cook1es: will there only ever be one with those attributes?
[10:34:34] <cook1es> is there no way to add another attribute to my current $('td[bgcolor*="#d9dde0"]') ??
[10:34:44] <Camer0n> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6558548/how-would-i-add-numbers-to-a-total-as-check-boxes-are-ticked
[10:35:01] <smykes24> cook1es: that doesnt look like jquery syntax
[10:35:11] <Kambfhase> $('td[bgcolor*="#d9dde0"][style*="border: red"]')
[10:35:23] <smykes24> and someone smarter than I jumps in
[10:35:25] <smykes24> aweseome
[10:35:27] <cook1es> smykes24: I suppose it's CSS selection that I use in jQuery
[10:35:32] <cook1es> Kambfhase: thank you :)
[10:35:34] <Whirl3d> or .filter
[10:36:16] <Kambfhase> smykes24: that will only work for styles that are on the element itself though, ie not styles set via classes
[10:36:38] <smykes24> Whirl3d: you mind taking a look at this?

[10:36:55] <Camer0n> ok
[10:37:13] <Whirl3d> Kambfhase or djQuery are the resident geniuses right off hand. I'm no expert.
[10:37:37] <smykes24> ive been in here under another name enough to know you know some stuff :-p
[10:37:42] <smykes24> Kambfhase: http://pastebin.com/2Fw0YX3H
[10:38:39] <Whirl3d> smykes24, what are you trying to do?
[10:38:54] <smykes24> so wen number1 is dragged on to it it turns red
[10:38:58] <smykes24> off of it white
[10:39:08] <tucan> does anyone know why im getting this error?   requiredfield is not defined [Break On This Error] (function(a,b){function cv(a){return f...indexOf(".")>=0&&(i=h.split("."),h=i.
[10:39:15] <Krambfhase> smykes24: syntax error?
[10:39:24] <Krambfhase> ?p @ tucan
[10:39:24] <bot-t> tucan, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:39:29] <smykes24> yeah but im not sure what Im doing wrong syntaxically
[10:39:47] <Krambfhase> smykes24: you are missing a }); on line 15
[10:39:58] * smykes24 smacks his forehead
[10:40:24] <smykes24> more to it then that it appears
[10:40:46] <Whirl3d> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#visual-feedback @smykes24
[10:40:51] <smykes24> missing } after property list
[10:41:07] <smykes24> Whirl3d: yeah they dont have an example that does it when it leaves the droppable area
[10:41:30] <smykes24> oh i se
[10:41:33] <smykes24> line si
[10:41:34] <smykes24> x
[10:41:45] <Whirl3d> I see what you mean
[10:42:31] <smykes24> yeah Whirl3d not the best demo for what i want to do
[10:42:37] <tucan> Krambfhase: http://jsfiddle.net/6A7kg/ im getting this error for some reason, any ideas why?
[10:43:31] <Krambfhase> I'd rather you paste your code
[10:44:27] <Whirl3d> smikes24, I think you will have to do something more like the simple photo manager on the same UI page
[10:44:34] <Whirl3d> smykes24, sorry
[10:44:50] <smykes24> yeah ill take a longer look at that one
[10:45:06] <tucan> Krambfhase: my code is on a live website, http://www.chinesedictionary.net/   you can see an error in firebug as you type a few letters in search box
[10:45:08] <Whirl3d> smykes24, in other words, create another droppable that accepts the item outside of your intended droppable.
[10:45:24] <smykes24> well that would work
[10:45:36] <smykes24> but the documentation says it acceppts out
[10:45:48] <smykes24> so i figured i could ust do that
[10:46:49] <Krambfhase> tucan: there is some code on you form! <form id="form1" method="GET" action="/search" onSubmit="return requiredfield();">
[10:46:58] <progrock> anyone got some advice on how to get jQuery UI sorting with tables to work?
[10:47:02] <Whirl3d> smykes24, perhaps you could use the tolerance option
[10:47:18] <progrock> it works, except the tabl;e row ends up taking 2 rows which i dont awnt
[10:47:21] <tucan> Krambfhase: oh
[10:47:26] <Krambfhase> :)
[10:47:27] <progrock> i want it to keep its dimensions
[10:48:05] <smykes24> Whirl3d:  that looks like it would work
[10:48:10] <smykes24> but the documentation is so bad :-p
[10:48:23] <Whirl3d> smykes24, looks like you want to bind the dropout function too
[10:48:29] <tucan> Krambfhase: fixed it, haha sorry bout that
[10:48:34] <Krambfhase> :)
[10:48:37] <Krambfhase> shit happens
[10:49:44] <smykes24> i thought there was snappable tooo Whirl3d i must be imagining things
[10:54:29] <Camer0n> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6558548/how-would-i-add-numbers-to-a-total-as-check-boxes-are-ticked  - has ANYONE got an answer to this???
[10:58:42] <tmayr_> Camer0n: you can start by giving each checkbox a value, then on click check its value
[10:58:47] <tmayr_> and add / substract
[10:59:00] <Camer0n> yes ut i don't know how :/
[10:59:24] <tmayr_> give each checkbox a class, then do $('.class').change(function(){})
[10:59:39] <tmayr_> i think it was change, cant remember :p
[10:59:56] <tmayr_> then inside, check if its checked, if it is, add its value, if its not, substract it
[11:00:02] <tmayr_> now you have a place to start ;)
[11:01:11] <kbni> Greetings =)
[11:02:23] <kbni> I am adding a script with $('head').append() -- and I am wanting to setup a callback for after that script has been fetched from the server, how can this be done?
[11:08:38] <djQuery> kbni: see ?getScript
[11:08:38] <bot-t> kbni, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[11:09:42] <muzone_> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?02c&raw - how do I make the current price range follow its respective slide buttons? And for the highest and lowest prices to position themselves on their ends when their buttons are too far away? Like on Topshop: http://tinyurl.com/6fvb3fw
[11:12:05] <djQuery> muzone_: if you want to see exactly how they do it open it in chrome. then right click and inspect element. finaly right click the eleemnt in the elements tab and choose break on attribute modification
[11:13:32] <muzone_> i didnt know chrome could do that
[11:14:05] <djQuery> muzone_: I think it looks fine how u have it actualy
[11:14:17] <muzone_> but im much more curious how to do it in jquery though
[11:14:22] <muzone_> well, you do have a point..
[11:14:42] <Acorn> Is it possible to use a jquery object in a selector
[11:15:00] <Acorn> for example using the next selector in relation to an already selected DOM element
[11:15:03] <djQuery> muzone_: all they are doing is setting the margin left and right to move the item based on what percentage of the total is selected
[11:15:44] <laumonier> is it worthwile to learn javascript or jquery is enough ?
[11:15:45] <djQuery> Acorn: are you not familar with chaining? see .next
[11:16:04] <djQuery> laumonier: yes it is becase jquery is javascript
[11:16:13] <djQuery> ?jsisjs
[11:16:13] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[11:16:15] <muzone_> djQuery: Any chance I could pay you some to modify http://www.webdevout.net/test?02c for me?
[11:16:32] <Acorn> djQuery: Oh, right, so I'd use a function of the object rather than a selector.. like .parent()
[11:16:58] <djQuery> Acorn: yes see ?jqf
[11:16:58] <bot-t> Acorn, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[11:17:02] <Acorn> djQuery: is there a way to run a whole selector string in relation to a jquery object?
[11:17:04] <djQuery> laumonier: see ?101
[11:17:05] <bot-t> laumonier, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:17:08] <Acorn> djQuery: ah, cheers for the link
[11:17:41] <djQuery> laumonier: even though we have it listed under 101 it is actualy a pretty complete reference
[11:18:12] <kbni> djQuery: thanks for that mate :)
[11:18:26] <Whirl3d> how do I deal with NaN?
[11:18:53] <djQuery> Whirl3d: carefuly?
[11:19:30] <Whirl3d> cute, djQuery, cute.   Seriously, how do I evaluate a variable with NaN?  if (val==NaN) doesn't work

[11:21:31] <Whirl3d> anybody ever notice how w3 schools logo looks like a corkscrew penis?

[11:22:17] <djQuery> Whirl3d: see ?w3schools
[11:22:18] <bot-t> Whirl3d, http://w3fools.com
[11:22:37] <djQuery> Whirl3d: have them blocked from my search results
[11:22:54] <Acorn> I don't think w3fools critisize them on their corkscrew penis logo though..
[11:23:22] <djQuery> Acorn: no they got too involved on all the other stuff to critisize them on
[11:23:44] <Acorn> They missed the important stuff :)
[11:24:54] <Acorn> djQuery: having a read through jq fundamentals, I can see the way that you can refine a selector by using functions and chaining.. but is there a way to use the selector string notation combined with an existing selection?
[11:25:44] <notjrbauer> im trying to make a gallery with jquery and when you click 'view back of product' it shows the back of a product. Is there a general way of doing this instead of manually putting in the src relative to the image?
[11:26:00] <Acorn> something like $($selection, ':parent img.someclass') ?
[11:32:03] <Krambfhase> ?find @ Acorn
[11:32:03] <bot-t> Acorn, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[11:32:35] <djQuery> Acorn: $('selector', context).whatever.
[11:32:48] <rosco_y> Is jQuery strongly typed?
[11:33:03] <djQuery> Acorn: but I agree with Krambfhase that .find is easier to read
[11:33:24] <djQuery> rosco_y: javascript is not strongly typed and jquery is javascript
[11:33:36] <rosco_y> djQuery: Thank you.
[11:33:39] <Acorn> how would you find the parent of the selection with find?
[11:33:52] <Krambfhase> ?parent @ Acorn
[11:33:52] <bot-t> Acorn, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[11:33:55] <djQuery> .parent instead of .find
[11:34:08] <Acorn> so you can't do it with find?
[11:34:25] <Krambfhase> no
[11:34:28] <Acorn> or you'd have to take the first child and do :parent:parent?
[11:34:42] <Krambfhase> .find() looks down.
[11:34:54] <Acorn> ah, so you can't break out?
[11:35:29] <kbni> Weird question... but is there a goastse favicon somewhere?
[11:36:47] <Krambfhase> did goatse even have a favicon?
[11:37:21] <Acorn> How would you get the html from a selection?
[11:37:46] <djQuery> ?.insertbefore
[11:37:47] <bot-t> .insertBefore(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements before the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[11:38:40] <djQuery> ok I have an element and I want to wrap it in a comment?
[11:40:12] <djQuery> need to wrap it with <!--item--><!--/item-->
[11:40:23] <djQuery> Krambfhase: ^^
[11:40:50] <Krambfhase> why would you want to wrap an element with a comment?
[11:40:54] <Acorn> what's the best way to find out what your selection contains when debugging?
[11:41:19] <Krambfhase> Acorn: console.log( $('my selecttor'))
[11:41:34] <djQuery> ?ftjq@acorn
[11:41:35] <bot-t> acorn, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:42:10] <djQuery> Krambfhase: its has something to do with the way that jsviews links the templates to the data
[11:42:25] <Acorn> Krambfhase: I can't really find anything of meaning in the object, where should I be looking?
[11:43:27] <djQuery> ?ui.widget
[11:43:28] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/Developer Guide - ui.core.js provides a factory method to create widget classes. The signature is $.widget(String name, Options prototype). http://docs.jquery.com/UI_Developer_Guide
[11:43:43] <Acorn> Krambfhase: oh right.. I've got a length of zero.. that's why
[11:45:03] <Krambfhase> Acorn: what browser do you use?
[11:45:14] <Krambfhase> oh, wait
[11:45:21] <Sieben> Hi everyone
[11:45:49] <Sieben> My code is available here : http://leone.iiens.net/js/
[11:46:04] <Sieben> Do you know a trick to make my toolbar
[11:46:13] <Sieben> on the map ?
[11:46:47] <Sieben> I'm kind of noob on jQuery
[11:54:14] <djQuery> Sieben: you could do this in css or you could use ?ui.position
[11:54:15] <bot-t> Sieben, Utility script for positioning any widget relative to the window, document, a particular element, or the cursor/mouse. Does not need ui.core.js or effects.core.js. http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/

[11:55:20] <Sieben> =)
[11:57:30] <James13433> Hi, I want to say if select value = "" then unselect the value how, do i unselect?
[11:58:30] <Acorn> Why does $(page).find('td.someclass:parent') not return the same as $(page).find('td.blackborder_details').parent() ?
[11:58:56] <Acorn> The former just returns the element that matched the selector and not its parent
[11:58:57] <djQuery> James13433: I typicaly dont fill just make the first one like this <option disabled="disabled"></option>
[11:59:29] <djQuery> Acorn: what are you trying to do there?
[11:59:44] <Acorn> djQuery: just select the parent of the matched element
[11:59:55] <Acorn> I thought that's what :parent did
[11:59:58] <djQuery> whats page/
[12:00:08] <djQuery> ?:parent
[12:00:08] <bot-t> :parent: Select all elements that are the parent of another element, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/parent-selector/
[12:00:30] <djQuery> dont look like it.
[12:00:45] <djQuery> also go look at see ?.closest
[12:00:45] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:03:21] <motaka2> hello I have a very strange problem with this page: http://en.key2persia.com/public_daily_tours/form/departments/reserve in firefox 3 when I submit the form with wrong captcha it gives me back all rows , but in opera or firefox 4 it is add one strange extra row
[12:04:50] <James13433> djQuery when I do that disabled thing it just uses the one below it for some reason...
[12:05:35] <motaka2> can anyone help me?
[12:17:29] <djQuery> James13433: hmmm in chrome it show a blank select.
[12:17:38] <djQuery> ?ask@ motaka2
[12:17:39] <bot-t> motaka2, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:17:57] <rosco_y> Why does the $(document).ready(function() keep firing:  http://paste2.org/p/1499857
[12:18:17] <motaka2> djQuery: thx
[12:19:07] <rosco_y> do have my $(document).ready(function() properly closed?
[12:19:23] <James13433> indeed http://jamesanelay.co.uk/hand1234/index.php/ on the left djQuery
[12:19:31] <rosco_y> no, I don't think that's it
[12:20:10] <djQuery> rosco_y: paste sites typicaly suck for this use a demo site as they usualy have a syntax checker in the or test your code yourself at jshint.com or jslint.com
[12:20:48] <rosco_y> djQuery: Thank you, I'll do that right now--might jsFiddle be of value for me now as well?
[12:21:13] <djQuery> rosco_y: yes it has a jslint button at the top.
[12:21:26] <rosco_y> :) ah, thanks again :)
[12:22:02] <djQuery> rosco_y: yeah thats what it supposed to look like
[12:23:14] <djQuery> rosco_y: well yah got the damn things cookie fied so theres no way to reset the form
[12:41:02] <rosco_y> is there something wrong with this for loop:  for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++)    ?
[12:41:17] <imsky> no, but cache the length
[12:41:25] <Krambfhase> use var instead of int
[12:41:46] <rosco_y> Krambfhase: thanks :)
[12:41:53] <Krambfhase> check your sntax at jshint.com
[12:42:04] <rosco_y> Krambfhase: will do :)
[12:44:27] <smykes24> how can i find out wat element was dragged on to a droppable element?
[12:44:36] <smykes24> im struggling with the documentation
[12:45:45] <Krambfhase> smykes24: i assume your droppable has a drop event handler?
[12:46:11] <smykes24> Krambfhase: part of the problem, im not sure what I would need to do
[12:46:20] <smykes24> i understand the handler
[12:46:57] <smykes24> something like this
[12:46:58] <smykes24> drop: function( event, ui ) {
[12:46:58] <smykes24> 				deleteImage( ui.draggable );
[12:46:59] <smykes24> 			}
[12:47:36] <Krambfhase> smykes24: yeah: http://jsfiddle.net/djbgy/
[12:48:02] <smykes24> thats a huge help
[12:48:04] <smykes24> tank ou
[12:48:05] <Krambfhase> just like in your code, the ui.draggable is the element that was dragged into this
[12:48:10] <Krambfhase> :)
[12:48:28] <smykes24> is the ui just an obect?
[12:48:44] <smykes24> why cant you use this.draggable or something
[12:50:01] <Krambfhase> this is the droppable element. I think it was seperated because you can drag different elements into the droppable
[12:50:19] <Krambfhase> that would result in overwriting this.draggable. totally chaotic
[12:50:44] <smykes24> hrm it gives me undefined
[12:50:44] <smykes24> odd
[12:50:55] <Krambfhase> ?p @ smykes24
[12:50:56] <bot-t> smykes24, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:51:03] <smykes24> yes yes  know
[12:51:05] <smykes24> :)
[12:52:07] <smykes24> what wil the ui.draggable give me in theory?
[12:52:12] <smykes24> the id or the class?
[12:52:23] <smykes24> guessing the class because its .
[12:52:51] <Krambfhase> ui.draggable - current draggable element, a jQuery object.
[12:53:15] <djQuery> instead of theory console.log it and take a look
[12:53:39] <smykes24> well it gives me undefined djQuery thats why i was ondering what it should give
[12:54:00] <Krambfhase> still waiting for a demo/ fiddle/ pastie
[12:54:01] <djQuery> then just ui then
[12:55:08] <smykes24> k let me come up with something simple for jsfiddle this could take a bit
[12:55:22] <Mnkras-Laptop> how can I have the accordion with all of its tabs closed?
[12:55:45] <Krambfhase> .hide() ;)
[12:55:50] <Mnkras-Laptop> ?
[12:56:06] <Mnkras-Laptop> by default the first tab is open
[12:56:25] <djQuery> theres a couple different options you hvae to set one is collapsable: true and I cant remeber the other
[12:56:33] <Mnkras-Laptop> yea i have that set
[12:56:40] <Mnkras-Laptop> tried playing with active
[12:56:54] <djQuery> but it has something to do with seting some option to -1
[12:57:00] <Mnkras-Laptop> just got it :P
[12:57:02] <Mnkras-Laptop> thanks
[12:57:06] <Mnkras-Laptop> active: -1
[13:00:50] <smykes24> Krambfhase: http://jsfiddle.net/Z3zzh/
[13:00:59] <bradmaxs> Is it best practice to keep all of my scripts at the end of the document?
[13:01:16] <Krambfhase> smykes24: you are missing a g in your draggable ;)
[13:01:30] <smykes24> omfg
[13:02:07] <Krambfhase> btw, you do know the , selector, right?
[13:02:13] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/Z3zzh/1/
[13:02:20] <djQuery> smykes24: ^^
[13:02:37] <djQuery> bradmaxs: faster that way
[13:03:35] <smykes24> Krambfhase: ?
[13:03:35] <bradmaxs> djQuery: awesome - it will help with my code layout as well.  thanks!
[13:04:04] <smykes24> dj what did you change?
[13:04:18] <smykes24> just the g's right?
[13:05:03] <smykes24> Krambfhase: I am unaware of what you are talking about sir
[13:05:08] <Krambfhase> smykes24: http://jsfiddle.net/Z3zzh/2/
[13:05:25] <smykes24> yeah i was vaguely familiar with them
[13:05:27] <smykes24> thank you
[13:05:29] <smykes24> much better
[13:06:08] <Krambfhase> :)
[13:07:24] <smykes24> Krambfhase:  is ui.draggable a jquery object?
[13:07:28] <smykes24> or do I need the $?
[13:07:45] <Krambfhase> a jQuery object.
[13:08:07] <smykes24> var droppedID = ui.draggable.attr(id);
[13:08:09] <smykes24> so that wil work
[13:08:19] <Krambfhase> ?TIAS @ smykes24
[13:08:19] <bot-t> smykes24, Try It And See
[13:10:34] <smykes24> it kind of works heh
[13:10:35] <smykes24> number1 ui-draggable ui-draggable-dragging
[13:11:15] <smykes24> have to figure out how to get only the first class back
[13:13:42] <diegoviola> hi
[13:13:54] <Krambfhase> smykes24: why would you want to do that?
[13:14:04] <JesseMan> hey everybody
[13:14:16] <JesseMan> i have a question... anybody know how I can get my site listed on http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery#H
[13:14:17] <smykes24> Krambfhase: i have a variable named after it
[13:14:22] <smykes24> i can just use slice
[13:14:24] <smykes24> or something
[13:14:27] <smykes24> no biggy
[13:14:49] <Krambfhase> you can slice it, but what happens if your classes have a different order suddenly?
[13:15:24] <smykes24> they shouldnt
[13:15:25] <smykes24> ever
[13:15:33] <Krambfhase> JesseMan: click [edit]
[13:16:00] <JesseMan> i think its been closed off because so many non jquery sites were spamming on there
[13:16:15] <diegoviola> is there a plugin that simplifies using HTML image maps? I want to create a map of America with selectable states, etc
[13:17:23] <al3xnull> diegoviola: I haven't used image maps in years. o.O Didn't realize they were still used. Don't know of any though.  Good luck finding one though
[13:17:23] <Krambfhase> smykes24: better use a regexp to parse the class attribute for the number
[13:17:33] <smykes24> fair enough
[13:17:37] <smykes24> that i have done before
[13:17:51] <diegoviola> al3xnull: how else can i do that? instead of using image maps
[13:17:55] <Krambfhase> yeah, image maps are totally out of fashion. you might want to use svg: http://raphaeljs.com/
[13:18:03] <JesseMan> at least i dont see a pay to make an account in order to edit the page
[13:18:45] <JesseMan> *way
[13:19:11] <al3xnull> diegoviola: Either Raphael or what I've done depending on requirements, a relative div, with absolute images inside of it which have click/mouseover observers on them.
[13:19:49] <al3xnull> diegoviola: I prefer Raphael, but whichever you are able to understand easy.
[13:19:53] <al3xnull> easier.*
[13:19:56] <diegoviola> al3xnull: ty
[13:20:04] <diegoviola> i'll take a look at those solutions
[13:20:05] <al3xnull> diegoviola: Np. Good luck.
[13:20:22] <al3xnull> And don't forget to thank Krambfhase ;)
[13:20:41] <diegoviola> sure, thanks Krambfhase ;)
[13:21:07] <Krambfhase> :)
[13:23:02] <JesseMan> Hi, Any idea how to edit http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery#H? I'd like to add my site to the list but it says "This page has been locked to prevent editing." I think it was locked because the page was getting filled with spam in the page
[13:23:03] <JesseMan> *past
[13:24:07] <JesseMan> maybe someone in here has the ability to edit locked pages and might be willing to add my site that is using jquery
[13:25:14] <smykes24> Krambfhase: I have a question for you im not sure how to phrase
[13:25:53] <smykes24> Krambfhase: http://pastebin.com/ZKgCiiUj
[13:26:05] <smykes24> the droppedID is actually another variable too
[13:26:19] <smykes24> i want the value of the other variable not droppedID to show up
[13:27:09] <smykes24> if that makes any sense
[13:27:28] <smykes24> lie var droppedID might equal 'number1'
[13:27:37] <smykes24> i also have a var called number1
[13:28:43] <diegoviola> Krambfhase: i just looked at raphael, and with this i must create the svg myself? can i get the svg from somewhere else and use it in raphael?
[13:30:49] <Krambfhase> diegoviola: check the web/wikiÃ¼edia ia am pretty sure there is a free svg of the us somewhere
[13:31:15] <diegoviola> ty
[13:32:01] <smykes24> Krambfhase: did my question make any sense whatsoever?
[13:32:03] <diegoviola> http://raphaeljs.com/ichart.html
[13:32:04] <diegoviola> wow sexy
[13:32:25] <Camer0n> how would i make this: $("#messages").load('ajaxLoad.php'); repeat every second?
[13:33:22] <Krambfhase> smykes24: like this? http://pastebin.com/Uu61GkjP
[13:33:58] <smykes24> Krambfhase: no the dropedId value is the name of anothervariable
[13:34:08] <Krambfhase> Camer0n: setInterval(function(){ $("#messages").load('ajaxLoad.php'); }, 1000) dirty, but will work( hopefully)
[13:34:23] <Camer0n> thanks!!
[13:34:37] <Krambfhase> it is the name of a variable? mkay.
[13:34:41] <sean`> you shouldn't be using setInterval + ajax
[13:35:27] <Prometheus> I would think it's better to do something in the complete callback
[13:35:37] <smykes24> so instead of displaying the droppedID text I want it to display the variable that that text represents
[13:36:01] <Krambfhase> you mean a variable as in var foo ?
[13:36:07] <smykes24> yes
[13:36:11] <Krambfhase> your fucked.
[13:36:21] <smykes24> k
[13:36:30] <smykes24> ill have to think of another ways
[13:36:34] <Krambfhase> that is "impossible"
[13:36:45] <Krambfhase> there is a nice way to solve this, though
[13:37:14] <smykes24> i was going to o if statements
[13:37:22] <smykes24> isomethinging more elegant?
[13:37:26] <Krambfhase> var map = {number1: "text", number2: "text 2"}
[13:37:47] <Camer0n> can someone test this pleae? http://vermilionsite.com/live/chat.php
[13:37:52] <Krambfhase> if you now do map[droppedID] you get the text for the ID
[13:37:54] <Camer0n> just type something random
[13:38:21] <Camer0n> thank you whoever that was!
[13:38:41] <sean`> Krambfhase, setTimeout + callback is the way to go, yes.
[13:38:42] <smykes24> yeah i find that confusing

[13:49:43] <Krambfhase> dunoo, i am allergic to apples
[13:49:48] <smykes24> gotcha
[13:49:53] <smykes24> what about android :-p
[13:52:19] <sean`> smykes24, yes
[13:52:25] <sean`> it works

[13:52:29] <smykes24> ty
[13:54:15] <superjacaman> smykes24 tryed jquery mobile?
[13:54:24] <smykes24> dabble
[13:54:25] <smykes24> d
[13:54:27] <smykes24> not recently
[13:55:29] <superjacaman> this seems to be your answer
[13:56:17] <tucan> eh i guess i could leave it like this but it kinda bothers me when the text shifts during hover
[13:56:48] <tucan> i think it's default behavior of jquery ui
[13:58:13] <superjacaman> tucan tryed do a autocomplete without using the ui?
[13:58:23] <superjacaman> its pretty simples
[13:58:41] <tucan> hmm
[13:59:25] <superjacaman> 3 events is enough to your autocomplete
[14:00:02] <tucan> i only used the ui
[14:07:00] <Camer0n> how do i clear a text input?
[14:07:19] <Camer0n> $.post('ajaxPost.php', $('#userArea').serialize(), function(data){
[14:07:19] <Camer0n> 				$("#messages").append('<div>' + data + '</div>');
[14:07:19] <Camer0n> 				$("#textbox").html('');
[14:07:19] <Camer0n> 			});
[14:07:24] <Camer0n> is what i've got so far :D

[14:11:27] <rosco_y> Segaja: thanks...I'm getting errors, but I have to run it to refresh my noodle as to what they are
[14:11:30] <Segaja> ah sry no
[14:11:43] <Segaja> at the end of line 8 you need a , not a ;
[14:12:25] <rosco_y> Segaja: I tried that, and the error I got was "myName not defined"
[14:13:07] <Krambfhase> use this.myname inside your function
[14:13:10] <rosco_y> ok, when I run it as is, I get "missing } after property list"
[14:13:17] <rosco_y> ok
[14:13:53] <dtach> can anyone suggest an approach to cross check 2 rss feeds i import, i got them as a UL list. of course i can put them into an array. Just wondering what the best way would be. I want to be able to cross check each item in Array #1 and if it is not in Array #2 do something with it
[14:13:57] <Segaja> ok, that was the second error with the this.
[14:13:58] <rosco_y> nope, still "missing } after property list"
[14:14:03] <cook1es> Hi! I need some help with css selectors (I think) in jQuery. I want to .append something to #reply_area which is in a <td> which also has a <a name="83"></a> in it. Perhaps there is a better way? Thanks in advance!
[14:14:06] <Segaja> rosco_y: wich line?
[14:14:28] <rosco_y> line 7
[14:14:33] <superjacaman> cook1es any code?
[14:14:51] <Segaja> which browser?
[14:15:03] <rosco_y> maybe I should just follow the tutorials more verbatum
[14:15:13] <rosco_y> I like to experiment
[14:15:44] <Segaja> rosco_y: http://pastie.org/private/ybvbssfxpp0btrk9n99dpg
[14:15:46] <Segaja> that works
[14:16:23] <rosco_y> yuck, I put a "}" after myName : "Rebecca" and I'm getting the exact same error
[14:16:28] <rosco_y> nope, still "missing } after property list"
[14:17:02] <rosco_y> ok, I'll go back to the tutorial, and assume it'll come to me over time....
[14:17:14] <cook1es> superjacaman: Do you want the code of the HTML or?
[14:17:17] <rosco_y> Thanks Segaja
[14:17:21] <Segaja> np
[14:18:33] <bluff> Segaja: got a q for you, is it possible to replace text names of freenode to pictures with javascript?pt
[14:19:19] <bluff> webclient freenode thats in the browser
[14:19:27] <superjacaman> the js code cook1es is enough
[14:19:55] <bluff> superjacaman: is that answer for me?
[14:20:11] <cook1es> superjacaman: I don't have any.
[14:20:30] <superjacaman> cook1es what you wanna do?
[14:20:42] <superjacaman> bluff sorry?
[14:20:53] <bluff> though you were talking to me
[14:21:11] <superjacaman> ok
[14:21:31] <bluff> maybe you can answer my q?
[14:21:48] <superjacaman> what is?
[14:21:52] <bluff>  is it possible to replace text names of freenode to pictures with javascript?
[14:22:51] <superjacaman> yep little hard but possible
[14:23:03] <bluff> ok thnx
[14:23:04] <Segaja> bluff: what?
[14:23:31] <bluff> lol Segaja okay whats your opinion on that
[14:23:48] <bluff>  is it possible to replace text names of freenodes webchat to pictures, with javascript?
[14:24:00] <Segaja> should be
[14:24:22] <bluff> even thou its dynamic based?
[14:24:31] <cook1es> superjacaman: Sorry, It's hard to explain. So I'm on index.php and I want to extract data from #reply_area on index.php?name=Cook1es, any ideas?
[14:24:44] <Segaja> yes, but it would be a bit more tricky
[14:24:49] <bluff> k thnx
[14:25:05] <Segaja> like having a function that runs on a timer and does the stuff
[14:25:12] <bluff> i c
[14:25:26] <Segaja> or if you are lucky catch the event for a new line from the webchat but i don't think that is possible
[14:25:37] <Segaja> if that is possible the webchat would have to have a plugin structure
[14:25:58] <superjacaman> cook1es u wanna pass info from to another?
[14:26:11] <cook1es> yes
[14:26:46] <superjacaman> a simple form in html should solve this
[14:27:03] <Segaja> that doesn't sound like a jquery problem :)
[14:27:29] <cook1es> you guys dont understand, it has to be done with jquery.
[14:27:38] <superjacaman> why?
[14:27:53] <superjacaman> $.post ready about it
[14:28:05] <cook1es> not $.get?
[14:28:29] <superjacaman> are the same for me
[14:28:35] <superjacaman> i preffer .post
[14:28:45] <bluff> Segaja: did you get my pm?
[14:29:26] <Segaja> yes yes
[14:29:33] <Segaja> no rush mate...
[14:29:48] <bluff> sorry didnt know if /msg worked
[14:30:13] <Camer0n> how how can i make this http://vermilionsite.com/live/chat.php scroll to the bottom automatically?
[14:30:20] <cook1es> superjacaman: So if I want to get <input value="this"> from index.php?name=Cook1es when im on index.php, how do I type that?
[14:30:48] <cook1es> oh and, the input field has #reply_area
[14:31:03] <superjacaman> you need php jquery alone don't solve this
[14:31:19] <superjacaman> you need a post and a print command in the another page
[14:35:20] <cook1es> superjacaman: I don't understand why you say it's not possible when I can use $.get to get the whole DOM from another site...
[14:36:14] <Camer0n> how how can i make this http://vermilionsite.com/live/chat.php scroll to the bottom automatically?
[14:36:24] <Camer0n> anyone??
[14:37:02] <superjacaman> only with jquery is not possible
[14:37:08] <Camer0n> oh
[14:37:16] <Camer0n> what else then?
[14:38:41] <cook1es> Camer0n: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/270612/scroll-to-bottom-of-div
[14:39:21] <cook1es> superjacaman: Yes it is. I have extracted the DOM from index.php?name=Cook1es, now I just need to extract the string I want in the string I got.
[14:39:31] <superjacaman> Camer0n not for you sorry
[14:39:41] <Camer0n> oh ok
[14:41:28] <Camer0n> thanks that worked
[14:42:28] <superjacaman> Camer0n what u used?
[14:42:33] <Camer0n> $("#messages").scrollTop($("#messages")[0].scrollHeight);
[14:43:08] <superjacaman> nice =]
[14:43:29] <cook1es> Google is pretty cool
[14:43:32] <Segaja> Camer0n: you do know that you ask on two channels the same question?
[14:43:58] <Camer0n> yes :D I didn't know if i should use jquery of javascript
[14:44:02] <Camer0n> it seems jquery is best
[14:45:48] <cook1es> It's pretty awesome, especially when you've seen this http://gamequery.onaluf.org/demos/4/iframe.html
[14:45:59] <lil-murph> Is there a easy way to make my table cells highlight all their text with a single click?
[14:48:42] <cook1es> How do I extract a string (e.g. "Hello") from another string? (e.g. "Hello cook1es!")
[14:49:03] <Segaja> substr()
[14:49:12] <Segaja> or substring()
[14:50:53] <Camer0n> where one of you trying to hack me?
[14:50:59] <Camer0n> http://vermilionsite.com/live/chat.php
[14:52:26] <cook1es> Segaja: How do I use substring with string parameters?
[14:52:50] <Segaja> you know the string you are looking for?
[14:53:03] <Segaja> with string.indexOf(searchstring) you get the startposition
[14:53:36] <Segaja> now use string.substring(string.indexOf(searchstring), searchstring.length);
[14:54:26] <Segaja> sry there is a mistake
[14:54:39] <Segaja> string.substr(string.indexOf(searchstring), searchstring.length);
[14:54:40] <cook1es> Segaja: No.. I want to extract Hello from a dynamic source code.
[14:54:41] <Segaja> thats it
[14:54:50] <Segaja> huh?
[14:55:50] <Segaja> you must have the string you are searching in and the string you are looking for (searchstring). or not?
[14:56:03] <Segaja> if not than i missunderstood your question
[14:58:19] <cook1es> nah its just hard to explain >< I want to assign <strong id="data">*</strong> to a variable and * is dynamic and I don't know whats in it
[14:58:45] <Segaja> that sounds like a job for regex
[14:58:52] <cook1es> yes
[14:58:55] <Segaja> but parsing html with regex is a bad idea
[14:59:39] <cook1es> shouldnt it be easy as there is an id?
[14:59:57] <cook1es> i dont know any regex though
[15:00:08] <Segaja> cook1es: $('#data').text()
[15:00:53] <cook1es> <strong id="data">*</strong> is not in the DOM, its in a variable.
[15:01:12] <Segaja> so what?
[15:01:20] <Segaja> $(variable).find('#data').text()
[15:01:31] <Segaja> or $('#data', $(variable)).text()
[15:01:37] <Segaja> variable would be the name of your var
[15:01:42] <cook1es> oh thanks i didnt know that was possible
[15:01:54] <Segaja> neither did i until last week when i needed it
[15:02:00] <Segaja> but there are some restrictions
[15:02:18] <Segaja> the string in the variable has to be valid html code with one outer container which is NOT your wanted id element
[15:03:25] <cook1es> ok cool. I think it should work on my variable data gotten from $.get("http://www.google.se", function(data){ then
[15:03:39] <Segaja> yes
[15:03:52] <Segaja> what is .se?
[15:04:14] <cook1es> sweden
[15:04:21] <Segaja> ah ok
[15:08:30] <cook1es> hmm.. var new_data = $(data).find('#data').text(); doesnt seem to work
[15:08:53] <cook1es> segaja:
[15:09:27] <Segaja> $(data).size() what does this say?
[15:10:54] <lil-murph> Is there a easy way to make my table cells highlight all their text with a single click?
[15:11:19] <Segaja> define highlight
[15:11:28] <lil-murph> select
[15:11:43] <lil-murph> like .. so you could hit copy and it'd get all the text in the cell
[15:11:45] <djQuery> grrrr how can I access the text nodes of a an eleemnt. in particular  I need to edi the comments of a tbody.
[15:14:07] <lil-murph> kinda like how you get if you triple click the text, just trying to save clicks
[15:14:12] <djQuery> lil-murph: $('#mytable>tbody').delegate('
[15:14:26] <cook1es> Segaja: var size = $(data).size(); alert(size); returns 41, so that works. Perhaps I can't assign .text to a variable?
[15:14:36] <Segaja> cook1es: yes you can
[15:14:49] <Segaja> what is the content of you tag with the id, cook1es ?
[15:15:26] <djQuery> lil-murph: $('#mytable>tbody').delegate('tr', 'click', function(e){    $(this).siblings('.active').removeClass('active').toggle('active'); });
[15:15:28] <Segaja> cook1es: .text() will strip html tags from the content of <strong id="data">*</strong>
[15:15:46] <cook1es> ahh, I don't want that, should I use .html instead?
[15:15:52] <lil-murph> djQuery, thanks! i'll try that out
[15:15:55] <Segaja> djQuery: if you want the text from one element do .text() on the element
[15:16:03] <Segaja> cook1es: might be an idea
[15:16:28] <djQuery> Segaja: parsing hte text of an tbody might be kinda resource intensive.
[15:16:43] <Segaja> djQuery: hm?
[15:17:46] <djQuery> var body =$(this).closest('tbody')[0], elms = body.getChildNodes(); but I get an error doing that
[15:17:55] <dtach> can anyone suggest an approach to cross check 2 rss feeds i import, i got them as a UL list. of course i can put them into an array. Just wondering what the best way would be. I want to be able to cross check each item in Array irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#1Â and if it is not in Array irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#2Â do something with it
[15:18:29] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, is it possible to use $.getScript with POST method ? thanks
[15:18:36] <djQuery> hmmm see ?remove
[15:18:37] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[15:18:48] <Segaja> djQuery: is [0] the same as .get(0) ?
[15:18:54] <Segaja> djQuery: and what error do you get?
[15:19:12] <djQuery> Segaja: yes it is .getChildNodes is not defined.
[15:19:23] <djQuery> Segaja: think I figured out how to do it.
[15:19:47] <Segaja> djQuery: why not $(this).closest('tbody').children() ?
[15:20:09] <djQuery> .children will skip the comments
[15:20:17] <Segaja> dtach: you could try with .each() to walk through one and check if it is in the second
[15:20:19] <djQuery> jquery ignores all comments
[15:20:34] <Segaja> djQuery: i would guess so
[15:20:36] <cook1es> Segaja: Working great thanks!!
[15:20:46] <Segaja> cook1es: yw
[15:20:57] <dtach> Segaja: ok, and how would i go about best checking if the value is in an array
[15:21:10] <Segaja> .inArray
[15:21:17] <dtach> oh :D
[15:21:22] <dtach> thanks
[15:21:27] <Segaja> hang on
[15:21:29] <Segaja> that is the wrong name
[15:21:45] <Segaja> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[15:22:16] <dtach> got it :)
[15:22:56] <djQuery> var $this = $(this),  $tbody = $(this).closest('tbody'), trs = $tbody.children().detach(); $tbody.text('').append(trs);
[15:23:13] <djQuery> presto no comments in the body
[15:24:03] <Segaja> whty $this = $(this)
[15:24:07] <Segaja> you don't use $this later
[15:24:16] <djQuery> Segaja: habit
[15:24:32] <Rainerbird> hey guys, what's the best way to check if an item is already inside an array of objects?
[15:25:06] <Segaja> Rainerbird: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[15:25:28] <Rainerbird> Segaja, I was reading that but wasn't sure how to apply that to an array of objects though, unless I'm missing something really simple
[15:25:59] <Segaja> uhm i must say i only used it on a string and an integer array so far
[15:26:06] <Rainerbird> e.g. I have [Object { Tag="tagName", Count="1"}, Object { Tag="tagName2, Count="1"},
[15:26:08] <Segaja> but i would simply try it with the object array
[15:26:39] <Rainerbird> I want to check  a variable against the tags in that array. E.g. if I have "tagName" it would match with the Tag value of the first object in the array
[15:26:39] <Segaja> djQuery: okay, you have the habit to asign a var you never use? interesting :D
[15:26:39] <Rainerbird> yeah
[15:27:09] <Segaja> Rainerbird: the alternative is to loop through the array yourself and on each element check the tag
[15:27:26] <Segaja> you can do this with jQuery.each()
[15:28:31] <Rainerbird> yeah I was thinking that as well, but since I'm getting tags from a json api feed I thought it may be CPU intensive
[15:28:57] <Rainerbird> what I"m doing is getting all the tags from the tumblr api of my blog, but want to check if a tag already exists and if so update the count. One sec I'll create a fiddle that makes more sense.
[15:29:18] <Rainerbird> therefore I'd have to run the each everytime the api has a tag which would be pretty crazy!
[15:30:17] <Rainerbird> http://jsfiddle.net/k2UML/
[15:30:29] <djQuery> Segaja: habit of not payin close attention to accuracy of just a chat window
[15:31:06] <Segaja> ah ok
[15:31:37] <Rainerbird> yeah, not sure if I am going about this the right way in the first place (by using an object array)
[15:32:38] <b3ngt> Taftse: Checked the source, and it seems that way. Thanks.
[15:34:05] <djQuery> Rainerbird: make it an object and not an array.    var tags = {}; $.each(data){  if(tags[this.tagname]){ tags[this.tagname].count++; } else{ tags[this.tagname].count = 1;}  })
[15:34:14] <djQuery> Rainerbird: or something like that
[15:35:11] <Rainerbird> thanks, let me just try and understand it so I learn
[15:35:25] <Rainerbird> so what you're doing is declaring an object called tags
[15:35:44] <djQuery> Rainerbird: with a prop for each tag name
[15:36:27] <Rainerbird> and everytime I get a tag from the api, if that tag already exists in the object, just update the count otherwise add the tag
[15:36:36] <djQuery> yeppers
[15:36:48] <Rainerbird> so in the else statement
[15:36:58] <Rainerbird> where you've got else{ tags[this.tagname].count = 1;}
[15:37:07] <cook1es> How would you guys find the closest <a> tag going upwards in the DOM from <a class="q">?
[15:37:13] <djQuery> Rainerbird: in the else it is just creating it since it didnt exist and setting the count to 1
[15:37:15] <Rainerbird> how is that adding the tag to the object? does it just automatically push or something?
[15:37:19] <Rainerbird> ah ok
[15:37:27] <Rainerbird> i'm just used to using "push" with arrays etc
[15:37:42] <djQuery> if its not defined it will create it kinda like push
[15:38:06] <djQuery> cook1es: see ?closest
[15:38:07] <bot-t> cook1es, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[15:38:25] <djQuery> there is also see ?nextuntil
[15:38:25] <Rainerbird> thanks djQuery, I knew it would be something pretty simple
[15:38:25] <bot-t> .nextUntil([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[15:38:42] <Rainerbird> sometimes it appears I go the longest track most of the time
[15:38:49] <Rainerbird> thanks a lot
[15:38:50] <djQuery> Rainerbird: saw you post it early this morn but didnt get a chance to respond
[15:39:16] <Rainerbird> that post was a while ago! it was before I went to bed, I only just got up :)
[15:39:23] <djQuery> went to bed at about 2 or 3 and got up at 6:30
[15:39:47] <cook1es> djQuery: the first <a> is not part of the upper <a> though, will closest() still work?
[15:40:05] <djQuery> cook1es: see ?demo
[15:40:06] <bot-t> cook1es, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:40:38] <notjrbauer> can anyone suggest the best way to implement a counter for when someone clicks a front or back arrow image: clicks forward arrow displays image that says '1 of 5', or '2 of 5'
[15:42:04] <djQuery> notjrbauer: var counter = 0; $('#next').click(functin(e){ counter++;  }); $('#prev').click(functin(e){ counter--;  });
[15:42:31] <djQuery> notjrbauer: and its been a long day so you may wana spell function correctly
[15:42:58] <notjrbauer> haha alright thanks, it's just the counter is going to be an array of images that say 1 of 5 etc
[15:45:34] <gurumelo> djQuery: are you human?
[15:47:23] <djQuery> gurumelo: yes just got a project I am workin on and 7 more 12ack or dr.pep
[15:47:59] <gurumelo> : ) you are great
[15:48:24] * djQuery speaking of which
[16:11:53] <portal`> dev'ing for mobile - running into a problem - The top status bar goes over my header - is there a meta tag i need to include to push it down? (not many people in the mobile chan)
[16:20:27] <notjrbauer> I have an array of images that are just numbers for a counter, should I prepend or something on each click to change it?
[16:21:34] <Mnkras-Laptop> im having an issue with having an accordion in an accordion,
[16:22:58] <JKarsrud> notjrbauer:
[16:23:06] <JKarsrud> oops
[16:23:09] <djQuery> <span class="holder">Image <span class="currentcount"></span> of <span class="totaltimages"></span></span>
[16:23:10] <JKarsrud> what do you mean?
[16:23:19] <djQuery> notjrbauer: that make it easy?
[16:24:13] <notjrbauer> eh, not really
[16:24:41] <notjrbauer> i just need to replace an image on click basically
[16:24:59] <notjrbauer> i click on an icon, image changes based on the counter
[16:25:09] <djQuery> set the html of the $('.currentcount').html(wahteverwecalled that var earler);
[16:25:28] <Mnkras-Laptop> http://jsfiddle.net/RLtBm/
[16:25:43] <Mnkras-Laptop> can some one give me a hand,
[16:25:53] <Mnkras-Laptop> i have an accordian in an accordion,
[16:26:15] <Mnkras-Laptop> when trying to open the second accordion it kinda fails
[16:34:28] <coldhead> Mnkras-Laptop: http://jsbin.com/axulo
[16:34:42] <coldhead> that's a demo of it working so uh try to be more like that?
[16:34:53] <Mnkras-Laptop> hehe
[16:35:36] <JKarsrud> don't me mean, coldhead :D
[16:36:00] <coldhead> i'm not being mean!
[16:36:03] <Mnkras-Laptop> :P
[16:36:07] <coldhead> i don't know UI
[16:36:11] <Mnkras-Laptop> adding clearStyle: true to the options helped
[16:36:15] <coldhead> so that's as helpful as i can be
[16:36:21] <Mnkras-Laptop> it just transitions glitchy
[16:36:30] <JKarsrud> coldhead: hehe
[16:36:38] <JKarsrud> I know, man, I'm just kidding ;)
[16:36:47] <coldhead> phew!
[16:37:02] <JKarsrud> should be tired, but I'm not, so playing around with node like all the cool kids are these days
[16:37:18] <coldhead> on which OS, JKarsrud ?
[16:37:19] <JKarsrud> should probably write more on that slider plugin I'm making, but meh
[16:37:20] <JKarsrud> OSX
[16:37:32] <JKarsrud> also like all the cool kids ;)
[16:40:02] <JKarsrud> why coldhead?
[16:40:03] <JKarsrud> :)
[16:40:25] <coldhead> might need help compiling it on windows soon
[16:40:36] * coldhead crosses your name off the list
[16:40:58] <JKarsrud> ah, right
[16:41:07] <JKarsrud> well, a windows version is in the works tho
[16:41:18] <coldhead> yes but i might need it before then
[16:41:21] <JKarsrud> I've had it running in cygwin at work too
[16:41:22] <coldhead> hopefully not
[16:41:29] <JKarsrud> but that's not exactly stable
[16:41:29] <JKarsrud> :D
[16:42:36] <JKarsrud> but atleast it's doable
[16:42:54] <JKarsrud> do you plan on deploying it on windows too?
[16:43:33] <innociv> The hell...
[16:43:42] <innociv> if( newmsgs != 'undefined' )  gives me "newmsgs is undefined"
[16:43:51] <innociv> No shit, that's what I'm trying to check :|
[16:44:07] <JKarsrud> typeof(newmsgs) ?
[16:44:19] <JKarsrud> or is it typeof newmsgs
[16:44:22] <JKarsrud> I never remember
[16:44:45] <innociv> it's without the parathesis
[16:45:04] <innociv> and it still says undefined.
[16:45:05] <innociv> ..
[16:45:14] <coldhead> JKarsrud: i might need to get jshint as part of the build process for a colleague on windows
[16:45:16] <innociv> ah nvm
[16:45:43] <JKarsrud> coldhead: aha
[16:48:22] <JKarsrud> but doesn't jshint have some windows wrapper thingy?
[16:49:00] <coldhead> it does!? pro-tip!
[16:49:18] <JKarsrud> cscript env/wsh.js myscript.js
[16:49:30] <JKarsrud> https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/master/env/wsh.js
[16:50:04] <JKarsrud> says so in the readme atleast :)
[16:50:05] <JKarsrud> https://github.com/jshint/jshint/#readme
[16:50:55] <JKarsrud> I can't see anything in jshint.js that says that it has to be run in node either, just that it's easy to do so out of the box :)
[16:51:00] <coldhead> thank you so much
[16:51:24] <JKarsrud> no problem dude :)
[16:51:33] <JKarsrud> I think I deserve a smoke now :D
[16:51:41] <JKarsrud> unless you want to run tests, tho
[16:51:49] <JKarsrud> but then I guess you could just install cygwin to do that ;)
[16:52:05] <coldhead> i'll install linux in a vm before i do that
[16:53:06] <JKarsrud> hah, yeah
[16:53:09] <JKarsrud> I'd do that too
[16:53:21] <JKarsrud> luckily I got my will and got a 27" imac at work
[16:53:41] <JKarsrud> we do primarily .NET stuff tho, so I'm stuck in a VM with W7 when not doing pure frontend :(
[16:53:48] <gurumelo> still there windows?
[16:53:53] <coldhead> oh gross
[16:54:10] <JKarsrud> luckily I don't do much serverside stuff
[16:54:17] <JKarsrud> seeing as I'm hired as a frontend dev :D
[16:54:43] <JKarsrud> but sometimes the devs fuck up the markup so bad I just have to, and working with .NET I have to compile shit, so =(
[16:55:00] <JKarsrud> gurumelo: whut?
[17:13:18] <djQuery> JKarsrud: mono.org?
[17:13:23] <Zaarin> hi
[17:13:42] <Zaarin> why does $("#" + id).attr("rows", $("#" + id).attr("rows") - 10) work but not $("#" + id).attr("rows", parseInt($("#" + id).attr("rows")) + 10) ?
[17:14:01] <JKarsrud> djQuery: I've tried making our projects build on Mono, but they just won't
[17:14:13] <Zaarin> typo.. the latter is $("#" + id).attr("rows", $("#" + id).attr("rows") + 10)
[17:14:46] <Zaarin> when I subtract 10, the textarea becomes 10 rows shorter...but if I add 10, it just adds "10" to the end of the current amount of rows
[17:14:59] <Zaarin> so a textarea that's 10 rows high becomes 100 rows high :S
[17:15:16] <Zaarin> with parseInt, it works...just wondering why
[17:15:46] <JKarsrud> because attr returns a string?
[17:16:06] <JKarsrud> string + number only does string10
[17:16:10] <Zaarin> nm, see it now...
[17:16:11] <Zaarin> yeah :)
[17:18:34] <Mrfloyd> najidebian: kaleb
[17:18:34] <Rainerbird> hi djQuery, if you're still there I'm still having a few problems. I'm trying what you said but it's saying that tag is undefined. http://jsfiddle.net/rainerbird/k2UML/6/ (I'm not too knowledged when it comes to working with objects, anywhere I can read online to learn more?) thanks
[17:18:57] <najidebian> inta emmak a7be
[17:20:48] <Mrfloyd> najidebian: STOP SENDING PRIVATE MESSAGES IDIOT
[17:22:48] <gurumelo> can somebody test http://labs.mario.ec/jquery-gmap/ ?
[17:22:56] <gurumelo> not display maps in local
[17:23:19] <JKarsrud> works here
[17:23:52] <gurumelo> works web but in local?
[17:27:17] <JKarsrud> gurumelo: works online, yes. I guess they might have some limitations on localhost when you use their api?
[17:27:18] <djQuery> Rainerbird: think it is because there are spaces in the tag
[17:27:58] <gurumelo> yes
[17:28:09] <gurumelo> But i think what is the problem
[17:28:31] <gurumelo> in the package for download there isn't css/example.css
[17:29:05] <gurumelo>  wget http://labs.mario.ec/jquery-gmap/css/example.css
[17:32:31] <ohaibbq> notifications are wonderful
[17:33:15] <ohaibbq> wrong channel
[17:34:55] <djQuery> Rainerbird: hey http://jsfiddle.net/k2UML/8/ I dont know what that error is.
[17:35:34] <djQuery> uncaught typeerror: cannot set property 'result' of undefined.
[17:37:23] <Rainerbird> djQuery hmm that is weird
[17:37:42] <Rainerbird> is it because I don't define the properties for tags at the start?
[17:37:43] <djQuery> Rainerbird: well my stuff stopped throwing errors
[17:37:55] <djQuery> noppers
[17:38:08] <djQuery> it has something to do witht he json
[17:38:29] <djQuery> coldhead: any insight?
[17:38:29] <gurumelo> are there any plugin for openstreetmap or openlayers?
[17:41:01] <djQuery> gurumelo: see ?lmgtfy openlayers jquery plugin
[17:41:01] <bot-t> gurumelo, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=
[17:41:16] <djQuery> ?lmgtfy openlayers jquery plugin
[17:41:17] <bot-t> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=openlayers+jquery+plugin
[17:43:12] <gurumelo> thank you
[17:46:19] <djQuery> Rainerbird: if you take out all the code inside the getjson callback does it still throw that error?
[17:46:36] <Rainerbird> I'll try that on the fiddle you sent me
[17:47:58] <Rainerbird> so I just changed it to 'http://purifytheme.tumblr.com/api/read/json' is that correct?
[17:48:17] <djQuery> Rainerbird: got no idear
[17:48:50] <xzhayon> hello! is there a way to trigger an event when an element scrolls into page, or do i have to use the jquery appear plugin?
[17:49:05] <djQuery> you know you can do $.getJson('url', {start: statrt}, function(data){}); right?
[17:49:10] <djQuery> Rainerbird: ^
[17:49:45] <Rainerbird> is that so I don't have to loop through? I'm doing that because tumblr only gets last 50 results I believe
[17:49:51] <Rainerbird> is that a better way of doing it?
[17:50:32] <djQuery> you dont have to pass the data in the url yourself. you can just do it as the 2nd param
[17:50:42] <JKarsrud> Rainerbird: you still need to loop, but you can supply getJSON with an object, which is then passed in as url params :)
[17:52:06] <Rainerbird> ah ok
[17:52:11] <Rainerbird> instead of doing it after the ? in the url string
[17:52:25] <Rainerbird> nice
[17:55:16] <djQuery> Rainerbird: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/k2UML/9/  but now I get an access error
[17:55:43] <sedawk> is there a difference between "function name() {}" and name: function() {}?
[17:56:16] <djQuery> sedawk: do a typeof  of each and see
[17:59:16] <JKarsrud> ?eval typeof function name() {}
[17:59:17] <bot-t> JKarsrud: "function"
[17:59:28] <JKarsrud> ?eval typeof var name = function() {}
[17:59:28] <bot-t> JKarsrud: SyntaxError: syntax error
[17:59:54] <kurisu> hi guys, does anyone know of a media (images, videos, audio) library frontend (for visitors)... or a loop that can automatically pull media (images, video, audio, flash) from a specific category and display in a nice library style
[18:00:00] <JKarsrud> ?eval var name = function() {}; typeof name
[18:00:00] <bot-t> JKarsrud: "function"
[18:01:22] <kurisu> ooops... wrong room
[18:04:22] <k4r1m> Hi I'm using a script that is based on a jquery 1.3.x and I just updated it to 1.6.2 and it broke anyone willing to help? http://pastebin.com/3zqKy5ah
[18:04:39] <k4r1m> I have kinda of debugged it and it seems to stop at the $.post call
[18:04:55] <ryanneufeld> k4r1m: can you build a reduced test case on jsfiddle.com ?
[18:05:26] <k4r1m> that site is.. broken?
[18:05:38] <k4r1m> spelled it wrong maybe?
[18:05:43] <ryanneufeld> ?p A k4r1m
[18:05:43] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:05:48] <ryanneufeld> .net whoops
[18:05:54] <k4r1m> oh alright second
[18:06:43] <k4r1m> http://jsfiddle.net/NsFHa/
[18:07:06] <k4r1m> there isn't really anything visual it's for a post a request
[18:08:04] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:08:21] <ryanneufeld> my suggestion is to use some console.log()'s at various stages
[18:08:24] <ryanneufeld> see what's going on
[18:08:42] <ryanneufeld> also double check the docs on $.post() see if anything has changed
[18:09:01] <k4r1m> yeah $.post looks completely different in the docs
[18:15:52] <k4r1m> however firebug is showing me that the post request has the right data just -1 result.. hmm
[18:19:00] <coldhead> ?eval var foo = {}; var bar "space gypsies"; foo[bar] = "lol aids"; foo

[18:27:16] <Liveman> Hey Guys
[18:27:44] <Liveman> Can you chain the div portion like this
[18:28:01] <Liveman> $(.onediv).(.twodiv).hide();
[18:28:04] <Liveman> or somethingl ike that
[18:28:05] <Liveman> like**
[18:28:18] <coldhead> $('.onediv,.twodiv').hide()
[18:28:40] <coldhead> $('.onediv, .twodiv').hide() // more readably
[18:28:59] <coldhead> also $('.onediv').add('.twodiv');
[18:30:29] <Liveman> sweet ty
[18:45:31] <McChen> hello all, how's everyone today?
[18:45:32] <McChen> :)
[18:46:16] <McChen> was wondering if anyone can explain the differece between parent([selector]) and parent().find()
[18:46:59] <coldhead>  parent selects the parent of the current element, optionally filtered by selector
[18:47:50] <coldhead> parent().find() will select the parent and then find() from there, so it will select siblings or descendents or nieces and nephews of the current element
[18:47:58] <McChen> ah i see
[18:48:26] <McChen> so in a way parent().find() can find nieces and nephews, which is better than using siblings()
[18:49:02] <coldhead> yes
[18:49:28] <coldhead> but parent().find() can also find the original element again
[18:49:31] <McChen> so parent([selector]) only finds among the selectors among its parents
[18:49:42] <coldhead> no, it only selects the parent
[18:49:51] <coldhead> and if the parent doesn't match the selector, it selects nothing
[18:49:56] <McChen> i see
[18:50:05] <coldhead> parents(selector) is what you might be thinking of
[18:50:11] <McChen> ahh i see
[18:50:14] <coldhead> there is also closest()
[18:50:18] <coldhead> ?closest
[18:50:18] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[18:50:28] <McChen> yeah singular and plural makes slight differences, i remember now
[18:51:20] <McChen> i see
[19:07:09] <notjrbauer> does anyone know why this conditional only switches for the first if:  if($("img.viewFront('src')") != "/img/denim/deniumCat/MensNumbers/1-of-5@2x.png>"){
[19:07:09] <notjrbauer> 	 $("img.viewFront").attr("src","/img/denim/deniumCat/MensNumbers/5-of-5@2x.png");}
[19:07:10] <notjrbauer> else if($("img.viewFront('src')")!= "/img/denim/deniumCat/MensNumbers/5-of-5@2x.png>"){
[19:07:10] <notjrbauer>  		$("img.viewFront").attr("src","/img/denim/deniumCat/View_Front@2x.jpg");}
[19:07:24] <notjrbauer> bah i didnt copy my pastebin link
[19:10:08] <bfred> how do I attach a touchstart event to the whole screen? $('screen').observe('touchstart', start); seems to work reliably here http://scripty2.com/demos/touch/touchspector/ but I'm already using jQuery
[19:10:48] <bfred> $(window).bind('touchstart', start) only fires when I tap on an element, not just anywhere
[19:11:09] <bfred> same with $(document). $(screen) doesn't work at all
[19:23:39] <PKKid> Hey, I created this plugin, but I can't get the release Download to show up in the Downloads table.  Do they need to be approved or something? http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-wysiwym
[19:26:11] <yogurt_truck> what does the code "if ( pass && name in jQuery.attrFn ) {" mean in .attr()
[19:26:13] <yogurt_truck> is attrFn a cache for the attr function?
[19:26:47] <rewt> name in jQuery.attrFn means if there's a jQuery.attrFn.name or not
[19:26:54] <coldhead> from that syntax i would assume attrFn is an object
[19:27:20] <rewt> then that truthiness is anded with pass
[19:28:21] <yogurt_truck> i see
[19:34:51] <PKKid> wow, with the amazing quality of JQuery itself, the plugins interface it horrid! ;-/
[19:35:03] <PKKid> website*
[19:35:19] <coldhead> i believe it's slated for an upgrade sometime
[19:35:38] <PKKid> Are they using some wonky third party package or something?
[19:35:54] <coldhead> wordpress?
[19:36:19] <PKKid> The jquery website is running on Wordpress? -- That would explain it. ;)
[19:37:18] <coldhead> if you want to offer your assitance in #jQuery-dev i'm sure it would be appreciated, PKKid
[19:37:35] <coldhead> the revamp is long overdie
[19:37:40] <coldhead> overdue* eep
[19:37:54] * Nuck is watching YAYQUERY!
[19:37:56] <Nuck> :D
[19:38:07] <coldhead> yay!
[19:38:16] <PKKid> is the jQuery website in a repo someplace?
[19:38:39] <coldhead> you'd have to ask ajpiano or someone, PKKid
[19:38:55] <coldhead> i believe something new is underway but i don't know how or where
[19:39:07] <PKKid> coldhead, thanks
[19:46:53] <ajpiano> PKKid, the plugins site is indeed being overhauled - there's a wiki for tracking progress on it and i'm managing the project
[19:46:56] <ajpiano> http://jqueryplugins.pbworks.com
[19:47:07] <ajpiano> unforch right now i'm chilling with my brother and it's saturday night
[19:47:23] <PKKid> ajpiano, Need any help?
[19:47:28] <ajpiano> so poke around that wiki a bit and if you have questions or would like to get involved, let's catch up after the holiday weekend :)
[19:47:39] <PKKid> ajpiano, I spoke too soon, thanks
[19:47:56] <ajpiano> ok :)
[19:49:22] <PKKid> ajpiano, Enjoy the weekend, I'll check out the notes so far.
[19:50:39] <ajpiano> PKKid: 1 sentence status update is: we have been working on and are near finalising a package.json spec for plugins distribution - we are about to start speccing out what we want the frontend to consist
[19:50:42] <ajpiano> of.
[19:51:38] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-plugins/blob/master/docs/json.md
[19:51:47] <ajpiano> alright, now i'm gonna de-irc - enjoy the 4th
[19:51:48] <ajpiano> :)
[19:52:07] <PKKid> thanks.
[19:57:47] <SalmanPK> yo
[20:00:25] <coldhead> looks like you'll have to help now huh PKKid :)
[20:00:43] <coldhead> hallo Salmon
[20:01:31] <SalmanPK> lol hi coldhead :)
[20:06:08] <McChen> anyone here has experience with using jquery in Drupal?
[20:07:52] <McChen> in Drupal there is this thing called Drupal.behaviors.mymodulename
[20:08:27] <McChen> hmm actually maybe i shoud find a drupal jquery channel to ask this
[20:10:17] <SalmanPK> hmm
[20:12:34] <Liveman> hey guys
[20:12:47] <Liveman> how would I do math with two differet .val
[20:14:09] <McChen> i am wondering
[20:14:09] <McChen> when should i add the 'context' parameter
[20:14:09] <McChen> do i have to add it to all the jquery selectors?
[20:14:47] <SalmanPK> no
[20:14:49] <systemfault> McChen: The context is the "starting node"
[20:15:10] <SalmanPK> yeah.  it will default to 'document'
[20:18:17] <min|dvir|us> Is e passed to a ready() callback?
[20:19:26] <SalmanPK> no
[20:19:42] <min|dvir|us> SalmanPK: Are you sure?
[20:19:55] <SalmanPK> see http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[20:19:57] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: What would e represent in that case?
[20:20:03] <min|dvir|us> The ready event.
[20:20:04] <SalmanPK> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[20:20:17] <SalmanPK> the jquery object will be passed
[20:20:42] <min|dvir|us> I believe that syntax is different.
[20:21:01] <SalmanPK> try  .bind() maybe :s
[20:21:20] <min|dvir|us> It's a theoretical question.
[20:21:22] <systemfault> ...
[20:21:27] <systemfault> There's no "ready" event.
[20:21:32] <systemfault> It's a jQueryis,
[20:21:39] <systemfault> jQueryism.
[20:21:51] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: There should be a ready event.
[20:21:56] <SalmanPK> well there is, DOMContentLoaded
[20:21:59] <min|dvir|us> Why is it different than any other event?
[20:22:25] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, cause it's completley synthetic - it simply isn't like the rest of events in jQuery
[20:22:28] <ajpiano> systemfault is correct
[20:22:33] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Because it's not a real event, different browsers have different means to detect if the DOM is ready.
[20:22:33] <min|dvir|us> So what if it's synthetic?
[20:22:43] <min|dvir|us> A lot of jQuery is synthetic.
[20:22:51] <min|dvir|us> I think it's worth it to maintain consistency.
[20:22:55] <min|dvir|us> To describe events in a unified manner.
[20:23:00] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, that's how it works, it is what it is.  there is no event object for when jquery's ready happens.
[20:23:08] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Fair enough.
[20:23:12] <ajpiano> and furthermore we couldn't change the argument passed at this point
[20:23:26] <ajpiano> because people expect the first arg to the handler passed to ready to be jQuery.
[20:23:43] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Why is it like that anyways?
[20:23:51] <min|dvir|us> Why can't one just say var $ = jQuery;?
[20:24:06] <ajpiano> one can
[20:24:19] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: What advantages does that particular argument choice give?
[20:24:32] <ajpiano> i think the reasons are mostly historical, to be honest
[20:24:36] <min|dvir|us> I see.
[20:24:40] <ajpiano> like, that's how it was implemented when john wrote it originally
[20:24:53] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Thanks for lending your wisdom.
[20:24:55] <ajpiano> ready is actually now an implementation of Deferred now as of 1.5, iirc
[20:25:26] <ajpiano> so it's just like, not like all other events that, ya know, have associated dom elements, etc.
[20:25:48] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: document?
[20:26:03] <ajpiano> sorta.
[20:26:09] <min|dvir|us> ...?
[20:26:33] <ajpiano> it's just on document because of convention though
[20:26:39] <ajpiano> afaict.
[20:26:46] <min|dvir|us> It makes perfect semantic sense.
[20:26:53] <ajpiano> i agree
[20:27:00] <min|dvir|us> So the convention is correct.
[20:27:29] <min|dvir|us> So there.
[20:28:03] <ajpiano> i agree with your contention
[20:28:05] <min|dvir|us> Is there a way to preventDefault but then reexecuteDefault?
[20:28:07] <ajpiano> that it is inconsistent
[20:28:48] <ajpiano> there is not one that i know of, and the question's come up before
[20:28:57] <min|dvir|us> Well that's retarded.
[20:29:42] <fotoflo> Yesterday Coldhead suggested I used $.debounce() for a  function, but i am having some trouble with it (it worked yesterday but somehow I lost that version - $.debounce( 250, function(){console.log("ok") } ); doesn't seem to work
[20:29:44] <ajpiano> not sure if it's realistically feasible in a generic sense
[20:31:05] <systemfault> What does debounce? I can't find that function :/
[20:31:13] <ajpiano> debounce is ben_alman
[20:31:15] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Of course. it would just be a method of event.
[20:31:17] <ajpiano> debounce is ben_alman's plugin*
[20:31:23] <systemfault> Ah ok, thank you
[20:31:24] <min|dvir|us> *It
[20:31:31] <min|dvir|us> event.call().
[20:31:33] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, yeah - that's the obvious part
[20:31:43] <ajpiano> how it would actually work is a different story
[20:32:01] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Well if the functionality's not supported browser-side then there's nothing you can do.
[20:32:15] <ajpiano> simply calling trigger with the same event object likely would not work the same as actually having the real browser event happen
[20:32:59] <min|dvir|us> Plus, if you're calling it from the same event, you could cause an infinite loop.
[20:33:05] <ajpiano> yeah
[20:33:13] <ajpiano> there are likely ways you could accomplish your goal
[20:33:20] <min|dvir|us> Sure hope so.
[20:33:30] <ajpiano> typically by decoupling your actual logic from being anonymous functions
[20:33:57] <min|dvir|us> How would a reference to my function help?
[20:34:03] <ajpiano> so that the handlers that are bound to elements are just things that can conditionally invoke a behaviour and then choose to prevent the default
[20:34:22] <min|dvir|us> Interesting.
[20:34:42] <ajpiano> so that the thing you'd need to "trigger" later you could just call from code instead of needing to trigger an event to call it
[20:34:55] <min|dvir|us> I could just make a boolean outside my function -- I only expect it to happen once.
[20:35:06] <ajpiano> there's also the "one" method
[20:35:08] <ajpiano> ?one
[20:35:08] <bot-t> .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[20:35:17] <min|dvir|us> Nice!
[20:35:26] <ajpiano> or yeah, unbind your handler after it exectues n times
[20:35:42] <ajpiano> you can unbind with a function reference
[20:35:46] <ajpiano> to unbind a specific function as well
[20:35:54] <ajpiano> so like i said, there are definitely ways to skin your cat
[20:35:57] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: You know a lot.
[20:36:06] <ajpiano> :)
[20:36:09] <ajpiano> i been jqueryin'
[20:36:14] <ajpiano> :)
[20:36:36] <djQuery>  evenin ajpiano
[20:36:42] <ajpiano> i gotta go hang with my brother though  - good night and good luck
[20:36:51] <ajpiano> i will leave you all to the capable hands of djQuery :D
[20:36:54] <ajpiano> evenin'
[20:37:02] <djQuery> NOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo
[20:37:18] * min|dvir|us stuffs djQuery into a duffel bag
[20:37:37] <SalmanPK> lol
[20:37:50] * djQuery zip it up im tryin go to sleep
[20:39:08] <min|dvir|us> How to simulate a mouse click?
[20:41:11] <systemfault> Can't you use target the element and call .click() on it without handler?
[20:42:35] <min|dvir|us> Don't know. I can try.
[20:42:54] <min|dvir|us> Does setTimeout pass anything to its callback?
[20:43:28] <SalmanPK> RTM >_> https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.setTimeout
[20:43:32] <fotoflo> sorry ajpiano: i had to step a way for a second. yes debounce is a plugin  var debounced = jQuery.debounce( delay, [ at_begin, ] callback );
[20:43:52] <fotoflo> $.debounce( 250, function(){console.log("ok") } );    should work, right?
[20:46:26] <SalmanPK> PING
[20:48:06] <systemfault> PONG
[20:48:20] <SalmanPK> :p
[20:51:52] <rogy> hello, i want to make a font selector using the users sytem fonts, is that possible?
[20:51:58] <rogy> with a select list
[20:52:15] <systemfault> No
[20:52:45] <rogy> hmm
[20:52:48] <systemfault> There's no way for a script to know what fonts are installed on the user's system.
[20:53:05] <rogy> does the browser know?
[20:53:31] <min|dvir|us> "event.trigger is undefined"
[20:53:32] <min|dvir|us> What?
[20:53:44] <min|dvir|us> rogy: The browser knows all.
[20:53:51] <systemfault> Hail to the browser.
[20:54:10] <SalmanPK> hmm http://hasseg.org/blog/post/526/getting-a-list-of-installed-fonts-with-flash-and-javascript/
[20:54:29] <rogy> http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=732611
[20:54:45] <min|dvir|us> So... Does 'event' as passed by event handlers not have .trigger?
[20:54:46] <systemfault> SalmanPK: Flash has indeed more privileges on the system
[20:56:57] <SalmanPK> systemfault: yeah i know, just showing a possibility :)
[20:57:16] <min|dvir|us> ...Anyone?
[20:57:30] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: I'm not even sure what it's supposed to mean.
[20:58:08] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: $('a').click(function(e) {    e.trigger.click(); return false;    });
[20:58:25] <min|dvir|us> This is supposed to work?
[20:58:33] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Why would it^
[20:58:48] <min|dvir|us> I expect e to have a trigger attribute.
[20:58:51] <min|dvir|us> But apparently it does not.
[20:58:54] <systemfault> Heh.
[20:59:01] <systemfault> Continue to expect.
[20:59:16] <systemfault> I expect to have a few million dollars in my bank account...
[20:59:21] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: Does my expectation conflict with reality?
[20:59:31] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: It doesn't make sense  :/
[20:59:46] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: My expectation is that e has a trigger attribute.
[20:59:50] <min|dvir|us> What part of that doesn't make sense?
[20:59:53] <systemfault> Why would it?
[20:59:57] <min|dvir|us> e is an event.
[21:00:01] <min|dvir|us> Events have triggers.
[21:00:08] <systemfault> :/
[21:00:19] <systemfault> Man, I want the drug you taken
[21:00:21] <min|dvir|us> That is the definition of causality.
[21:00:27] <min|dvir|us> I think you're trolling me.
[21:00:31] <min|dvir|us> Can I have some serious help?
[21:00:58] <SalmanPK> https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Event
[21:00:59] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: Also, it's called "weed".
[21:01:06] <systemfault> I thought you were trolling us to be honest.
[21:01:16] <SalmanPK> It doesn't have any prop. or method called "trigger"
[21:01:31] <min|dvir|us> SalmanPK: How do I refer to the object which caused the event?
[21:01:40] <systemfault> e.target or this
[21:02:00] <min|dvir|us> Oh.
[21:02:05] <SalmanPK> yeah
[21:02:07] <min|dvir|us> Why couldn't you just tell me?
[21:02:17] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: You were not clear mate :/
[21:02:41] <systemfault> Your last question was super clear... so you got a clear answer.
[21:02:53] <min|dvir|us> Right-o.
[21:03:24] <systemfault> Midnight already... fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu
[21:05:33] <SalmanPK> 9:05 AM here
[21:05:44] <systemfault> Ah :P
[21:06:05] <fotoflo> hmm having some issues
[21:06:11] <fotoflo> with the definition of a "callback
[21:06:12] <fotoflo> "
[21:06:52] <systemfault> Ah
[21:07:02] <fotoflo> I'm trying to use var debounced = jQuery.debounce( delay, [ at_begin, ] callback );
[21:07:22] <fotoflo> what goes in "callback"  console.log("a") doesn't work
[21:07:38] <fotoflo> and function(){console.log("a")} doesn't work either
[21:07:39] <systemfault> It's a function probably
[21:07:43] <systemfault> Hmm
[21:09:08] <min|dvir|us> Wow this shit looks so bitchin'.
[21:09:20] <systemfault> From the doc, seems that it's how debounce should be used.
[21:09:38] <systemfault> fotoflo: What do you expect? What tells you that it doesn't work
[21:10:17] <rogy> how i get browser font list with jquery, in all browsw3ers?
[21:10:18] <fotoflo> i expect the console to print a
[21:11:06] <min|dvir|us> Check this shit out. http://min.dvir.us/
[21:11:17] <systemfault> fotoflo: What is you sample code^
[21:11:19] <systemfault> ?
[21:11:27] <systemfault> </rewind>
[21:11:28] <SalmanPK> rogy: Thats not possible with jQuery, you will have to use Flash.
[21:11:34] <systemfault> fotoflo: What is your sample code?
[21:11:53] <fotoflo> systemfault: http://www.kuaibbs.com/jsfun/popup.html
[21:12:19] <fotoflo> in-between flagged and made it "a" should be printed
[21:12:47] <systemfault> fotoflo: From the way I understand it, debounce is not a timer.
[21:12:48] <Liveman> Hey guys, how would I do math for two input fields in jquery
[21:12:52] <Liveman> like add their value
[21:13:05] <systemfault> fotoflo: debounce returns a function
[21:13:30] <systemfault> fotoflo: And you need to call it if you want the function to be called.
[21:13:55] <systemfault> var debounced = $.debounce.......; debounced(); would print "a"
[21:14:03] <systemfault> That's the way I understand it.
[21:14:21] <fotoflo> oh so i have to run it?
[21:14:28] <systemfault> Yeah.
[21:14:52] <fotoflo> the timer (250ms) is the period of time to not accept bouncing
[21:15:05] <systemfault> Basically, debounce seems to be for callbacks
[21:15:26] <fotoflo> hmm that worked
[21:15:30] <fotoflo> 			var d = $.debounce(250, function(){console.log("a"); });
[21:15:31] <fotoflo> 			d();
[21:15:43] <systemfault> For example: $(this).mouseup($.debounce(250, function() { console.log('flagged'); }));
[21:17:52] <systemfault> This is spaaarrrrtttaaaaaa!!!
[21:18:43] <SalmanPK> :o
[21:20:23] <fotoflo> systemfault: yes, that works, brilliant
[21:20:28] <systemfault> :)
[21:20:42] <fotoflo> oddly the flagged is getting sent after "dropping"
[21:21:03] <systemfault> Well.. that's what mouseup is AFAIK
[21:21:09] <systemfault> perhaps you wanted mousedown?
[21:23:13] <fotoflo> dropTheDiv and Debounce are both on mouseup
[21:23:14] <fotoflo> p
[21:23:19] <fotoflo> its no big deal
[21:23:28] <fotoflo> just curious why there seems to be an order
[21:24:28] <min|dvir|us> Is this shit bitchin'? http://min.dvir.us/
[21:26:13] <SalmanPK> nope. epic introduction btw :p
[21:26:31] <min|dvir|us> I should remove the effects?
[21:27:27] <fotoflo> systemfault: thanks btw
[21:27:38] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Beside one small annoying bug, it's cool
[21:27:40] <fotoflo> probably would have taken me a LONG time to do that
[21:27:47] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: Which is?
[21:28:17] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: load the website, resize the window, click on a link
[21:28:36] <min|dvir|us> Nice!
[21:28:52] <systemfault> See :/ It fucks up
[21:29:00] <SalmanPK> yeah its cool .though u could have done that using CSS Animations, with graceful degradation :)
[21:29:25] <k4r1m> trying to set the format of the date picker to "4digit year/2digit month/2digit day" by calling "$("#date").datepicker("option", "altFormat", 'yyyy-mm-dd');" after initialization but it's not doing antying
[21:30:21] <systemfault> k4r1m: I never used datepicker before but I'd be surprised if the config works like that
[21:30:27] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: Thanks for pointing that out.
[21:30:36] <k4r1m> systemfault: i think i got it
[21:31:19] <min|dvir|us> SalmanPK: How?
[21:31:19] <systemfault> $("#date").datepicker({'altFormat': 'yyyy-mm-dd'}); I would expect something like that
[21:32:48] <min|dvir|us> Also, where does the extra 20px come from?
[21:33:31] <min|dvir|us> SalmanPK: Also this gracefully degrades.
[21:35:19] <SalmanPK> hmm am referring to css3 animations. And i guess it will be a bit tricky to get them working this way and wont be cross-browser so using jquery is better maybe. And yep i know.
[21:37:26] <systemfault> I prefer progressive enhancement to graceful degradation :P
[21:37:44] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: That's the way I see it.
[21:38:01] <min|dvir|us> Damn, I'm starting to be really happy with this.
[21:38:10] <systemfault> :)
[21:38:45] <cub> hey
[21:38:56] <cub> does anyoe know if this'll work: http://pastebin.com/v86DxE5w
[21:39:00] <cub> anyone*
[21:39:04] <SalmanPK> i see
[21:39:05] <cub> i tried it, but to no avail.
[21:39:24] <cub> basically all it should do is target bottomgreybar and change the margin depending on the resolution
[21:40:00] <ekkis> cub: it should work
[21:40:19] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us/ uses http://min.dvir.us/static/script/base.js. Why do I need to subtract an extra 20px?
[21:40:30] <systemfault> cub: Perhaps you have the wrong approach to the problem
[21:40:34] <min|dvir|us> (line 6, base.js)?
[21:40:34] <rewt> cub, what if screen.height == 1024?
[21:40:40] <ekkis> cub: one thing I'm not sure is whether you want "margin-top" or "marginTop"
[21:41:04] <systemfault> cub: How about using percentages or something like that^
[21:41:10] <rewt> cub, change line 4 to:  } else {
[21:41:14] <min|dvir|us> Anyone?
[21:41:19] <snover> cub: CSS media at-rules. Learn them. Love them.
[21:41:37] <ekkis> if screen height is 1024 he doesn't want to change anything I guess
[21:41:46] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: The js file is a 404
[21:42:22] <snover> media query at-rules*
[21:42:58] <min|dvir|us> Yeah, there's something weird going on. http://min.dvir.us/ is giving me a 500 error now.
[21:43:07] <cub> what
[21:43:13] <cub> margin-top
[21:43:16] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: http://min.dvir.us/static/scripts/base.js
[21:43:21] <min|dvir|us> Forgot an s.
[21:43:38] <cub> what css media rules
[21:44:09] <cub> i already tried the else
[21:44:18] <cub> and i don't think CSS is case sensitive either way
[21:44:30] <cub> well it probably is but anyways not relevant
[21:44:31] <SalmanPK> http://css-tricks.com/6731-css-media-queries/
[21:44:37] <snover> sigh.
[21:44:38] <snover> cub.
[21:44:46] <snover> thank you SalmanPK :)
[21:44:48] <cub> how is that relevant
[21:45:17] <cub> anyways OK
[21:45:18] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: height + bottom padding + top padding + border top ?
[21:45:23] <SalmanPK> welcome :)
[21:45:40] <cub> jQuery("#bottomgreybar").css("margin-top:120px;");
[21:45:44] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: of what?!
[21:45:48] <cub> i don't think that'll work though
[21:45:56] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: The footer has padding.
[21:46:04] <snover> SalmanPK: seems to have not helped :(
[21:46:05] <Davey> I have a *really* weird issue
[21:46:07] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Padding top of 10px and padding bottom of 10px
[21:46:23] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: 10 + 10 == ;)
[21:47:06] <Davey> I have a <script> tag in my code, it has $(function() { // do something }); in it which is actually needed site-wide, followed by page-specific JS. So I tried to move the $() to main.js and include it in my head... and the other JS /breaks/.
[21:47:10] <SalmanPK> :(
[21:47:21] <Davey> the scope is all busted, it's freaky
[21:47:35] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: Great call.
[21:47:38] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: You're good.
[21:47:44] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: I try to.
[21:47:48] <Davey> what do $(function() { }) do? by context, I'd say onload?
[21:47:59] <tbranyen> Davey: DOM ready
[21:47:59] <systemfault> Davey: DOM ready.
[21:48:04] <tbranyen> fires before onload
[21:48:06] <Davey> I was close ;)
[21:48:15] <tbranyen> close but not cigar
[21:48:18] <tbranyen> no*
[21:48:37] <Davey> why would just /moving/ code that is fired on DOM ready bust the scope of code that is in the page?
[21:49:06] <systemfault> Davey: There's no way to know.. perhaps you try to load the file before jQuery..
[21:49:15] <tbranyen> that doesn't make any sense, can you convey in a better way what the problem is?
[21:49:21] <tbranyen> You moved code and stuff broke?
[21:49:24] <Davey> hrm
[21:49:26] * Davey checks
[21:49:37] <Davey> nah, main.js is last to load
[21:49:51] <Davey> if you feel like changing your hosts files, I could show you the page... heh
[21:49:59] <tbranyen> sure
[21:50:00] <systemfault> :/
[21:50:16] <Davey> tbranyen: may I query you to give the info?
[21:50:22] <tbranyen> yeah go for it
[21:51:17] <Davey> tbranyen: that /should/ work, lemme know if it doesn't and I'll check my routers NAT
[21:51:23] * Davey checks anyways
[21:51:34] <tbranyen> yeah not working
[21:52:58] <Davey> yeah... like I can remember the password to this POS verizon router. grr.
[21:53:03] <Davey> OK, lemme fiddle it
[21:54:51] <Davey> I have this if it helps: https://gist.github.com/1061964
[21:55:11] <min|dvir|us> Hmm, found another bug.
[21:55:26] <min|dvir|us> Is there any way to make the back button fully reload the page?
[21:55:39] <Davey> min|dvir|us: tell the browser not to cache it
[21:55:54] <min|dvir|us> Davey: What do you mean?
[21:56:12] <Davey> min|dvir|us: erm... which part are you not understanding? :)
[21:56:27] <min|dvir|us> Cache what?
[21:56:32] <Davey> min|dvir|us: the previous page
[21:56:38] <min|dvir|us> So, as an HTTP header?
[21:56:55] <Davey> min|dvir|us: yessir, though you can do it with meta tags also, I suppose
[21:57:07] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us/
[21:57:11] <min|dvir|us> Click around, then click back.
[21:57:41] <min|dvir|us> Do you see what I see?
[21:57:51] <Davey> yup
[21:58:15] <min|dvir|us> This is a critical bug. If I can't fix this then I can't have the effects.
[21:58:22] <sam350> my swf video plays twice ( i hear it echoing, and if I pause it, the sound continues).  Has anyone experienced this?
[21:58:34] <Davey> min|dvir|us: are you using the history stuff?
[21:58:40] <min|dvir|us> Davey: What history stuff?
[21:58:49] <Davey> min|dvir|us: how are you modifying the URL?
[21:58:50] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: That's what you should use ;)
[21:59:01] <cub> my method worked
[21:59:03] <cub> for screen sizing
[21:59:09] <cub> but yeah you guys are kind of elitists or something,
[21:59:09] <min|dvir|us> Davey: document.location = $(event.target).attr('href').
[21:59:13] <cub> but cool thx for help regardless
[21:59:20] <sam350> I know this is #jquery but #flash is dead
[21:59:28] <Davey> min|dvir|us: ah... yeah.
[21:59:30] <systemfault> The jQuery community... elitist? WTF :/
[21:59:32] <sam350> if anyone can recommend a better place to ask, please advise..
[21:59:43] <min|dvir|us> What should I be doing?
[21:59:47] <Davey> min|dvir|us: http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html
[21:59:54] <min|dvir|us> Is this cross-browser?
[21:59:56] <Davey> also: http://html5demos.com/history
[22:00:10] <sam350> min|dvir|us keep in mind it is not working for all browsers
[22:00:28] <min|dvir|us> Then fuck it; it's not for me.
[22:00:50] <sam350> hash tags work in all browsers but that doesnt help with back button
[22:01:04] <Davey> min|dvir|us: http://caniuse.com/#search=history
[22:01:21] <Davey> that's a cool site :D
[22:01:25] <sam350> dude what you can do is
[22:01:33] <sam350> use hash tags for all your urls right?
[22:01:50] <sam350> and each time the hash tag changes, check if they are on a certain one
[22:02:01] <sam350> if they are on the first one, or "" (blank hash tag)
[22:02:14] <sam350> then let them go
[22:02:20] <sam350> do this on page unload with javascript
[22:02:26] <min|dvir|us> Davey: caniuse.com?
[22:02:35] <Davey> min|dvir|us: yeah, just found it
[22:02:36] <sam350> if they are not, pop the previous page they were on to the hash tag
[22:03:05] <sam350> but be sure that if they are on the home hash, you let them go and dont trap them on your site
[22:03:16] <sam350> this will work on all browsers unless they have javascript disabled
[22:03:22] <min|dvir|us> IE doesn't support it at all.
[22:03:26] <sam350> hash tags?
[22:03:53] <sam350> IE doesnt support history API no
[22:04:04] <min|dvir|us> I need some fix for this shit.
[22:04:19] <min|dvir|us> Should I set a timeout?
[22:04:32] <min|dvir|us> That resets the height?
[22:04:45] <sam350> try it
[22:04:50] <min|dvir|us> I know it'll work.
[22:04:58] <min|dvir|us> Wait actually I don't.
[22:05:02] <sam350> haha
[22:05:26] <sam350> well yah sometimes a very short timeout is necessary to reset a layout
[22:05:28] <sam350> but try to avoid it
[22:05:55] <sam350> has anyone seen an embedded flash video playing twice
[22:06:02] <min|dvir|us> It does work.
[22:06:08] <min|dvir|us> But I would really like to do it some other way.
[22:06:24] <sam350> yep its nicer ( i just checked your page when I came in)
[22:06:39] <sam350> what is with the "man this guy's good'
[22:06:42] <min|dvir|us> What...? I'm not deploying...
[22:06:51] <sam350> oh thought I noticed a dif
[22:06:53] <min|dvir|us> sam350: Don't worry about the content.
[22:06:58] <sam350> o ok
[22:07:25] <min|dvir|us> My only solution so far is to use setTimeout, but I really hate that. Any other ideas?
[22:07:38] <sam350> for what exact issue again
[22:07:49] <min|dvir|us> sam350: Click around and click back.
[22:08:25] <sam350> ok, are you doing your stuff on page load or what
[22:08:55] <sam350> there are other events that fire when a page gets focus
[22:09:14] <min|dvir|us> sam350: I'm doing my stuff right after I set document.location.
[22:09:15] <sam350> and you can change the way it is left
[22:09:22] <sam350> thats actually it man
[22:09:31] <min|dvir|us> What?
[22:09:33] <sam350> when it rolls up when user leaves the page
[22:09:39] <sam350> put it back
[22:09:42] <min|dvir|us> Where?
[22:09:42] <sam350> see if it flashes
[22:09:46] <sam350> maybe we wont notice
[22:09:53] <min|dvir|us> I know it flashes.
[22:10:01] <sam350> oh is that what you were doing before
[22:10:04] <min|dvir|us> Yes.
[22:10:21] <sam350> ok then back to the events
[22:10:32] <sam350> i think there is some event that gets fired when the page gets focus
[22:10:55] <sam350> solution to all of this is to use ajax
[22:11:15] <sam350> man sites that are loading TONS more are not page refreshing
[22:11:17] <sam350> why are you
[22:11:21] <sam350> if you are an expert
[22:11:32] <sam350> why are you using separate html pages for each page
[22:11:47] <sam350> like the way the web began
[22:12:01] <sam350> you put all your content on the page and change to it on the clicks
[22:12:11] <sam350> set the location.hash= "resume"
[22:12:21] <sam350> location.hash="bio"
[22:12:25] <sam350> location.hash="contact"
[22:12:30] <sam350> each time they click one of the links
[22:12:41] <sam350> and roll your page up, swap the div, roll it back down
[22:12:43] <sam350> you're done
[22:13:15] <min|dvir|us> sam350: $(document).focus() works perfectly.
[22:13:32] <min|dvir|us> Furthermore, I like graceful degradation.
[22:13:49] <min|dvir|us> And jQuery UI's implementation of tabs irritates me.
[22:14:00] <sam350> I dont follow
[22:14:07] <sam350> what does document focus have to do with it
[22:14:13] <sam350> and jquery tabs
[22:14:22] <sam350> and why does my solution not degrade gracefully
[22:14:38] <min|dvir|us> sam350: document focus allows me to reopen the page content when the back button is pressed.
[22:14:49] <sam350> Ive implemented this on several major sites and it works on IE6 even
[22:14:53] <min|dvir|us> Your solution does not degrade gracefully because it requires Javascript.
[22:15:16] <sam350> so does document focus wtf you smokin
[22:15:33] <min|dvir|us> sam350: Yes, to provide effects only.
[22:15:34] <sam350> and you can hide/show content with CSS
[22:15:51] <min|dvir|us> sam350: Animations are a far cry from being widely supported.
[22:15:57] <sam350> so they dont need javascript, only to show a different URL in case ppl are bookmarking your contact paage
[22:16:31] <sam350> target audience should be considered.  if you are a pro looking for a job, you can be sure they have javascript
[22:16:47] <sam350> you are not saying this is how you would do a major site, you are trying to show that you know how to do things
[22:16:56] <homosaur> hey, i have a little piece of code using jquery and coffeescript, would someone be willing to take a quick look at the project on github and tell me why it isn't displaying anything entered in the form? it's a very small thing, maybe 30 lines
[22:17:45] <systemfault> give us the direct link
[22:17:52] <systemfault> we're lazy
[22:17:53] <homosaur> https://github.com/homosaur/replico-js
[22:18:16] <homosaur> i'm trying to simply display the entered note in the browser, not save it or anything
[22:18:19] <min|dvir|us> sam350: Graceful degradation is much more important than using the newest/coolest advances.
[22:18:33] <homosaur> i think it's something i'm screwing up with .val function
[22:19:00] <min|dvir|us> Your shit should always work without JS.
[22:19:12] <min|dvir|us> It should always work without CSS.
[22:19:26] <sam350> yours would man
[22:19:34] <sam350> it would work
[22:19:40] <min|dvir|us> Using AJAX?
[22:19:42] <min|dvir|us> I don't think so.
[22:19:51] <sam350> listen
[22:19:59] <sam350> you are going to fail as a programmer sorry to say
[22:20:06] <sam350> you are telling me all the reasons you cant do this
[22:20:12] <sam350> I told you about showing hiding the CSS
[22:20:19] <min|dvir|us> sam350: Yeah, I already have a job.
[22:20:19] <sam350> I KNOW you can make it work in all browsers
[22:20:25] <sam350> so what you already have one
[22:20:33] <sam350> I didnt say you wouldnt find one
[22:20:35] <systemfault> homosaur: Is there any way for me to reproduce the problem?
[22:20:42] <min|dvir|us> sam350: Yeah, your opinion means nothing to me.
[22:20:47] <min|dvir|us> c=3 :)
[22:20:51] <sam350> lol I am trying to help you
[22:21:03] <sam350> learn to implement the CSS show hide on hover or click in all browsers
[22:21:05] <sam350> put that in your toolkit
[22:21:12] <min|dvir|us> sam350: Why would you even try to help me if you know I'm going to fail?
[22:21:16] <sam350> dont say how its so hard to cross browser implement
[22:21:35] <sam350> I started trying to help you before I see your attitude so you comment doesnt make sense..
[22:21:38] <sam350> I wont in the future
[22:21:45] <homosaur> systemfault: you could download the code and open index.html, i don't have it uploaded anywhere yet because it doesn't work
[22:21:48] <min|dvir|us> sam350: Consider being less autistic.
[22:21:50] <sam350> you are implementing hacks to fix your stuff
[22:21:57] <min|dvir|us> sam350: I don't think so.
[22:21:58] <sam350> I am telling you a bunch of ways
[22:22:04] <sam350> good luck to ya man
[22:22:06] <min|dvir|us> What is hackish about what I'm doing?
[22:22:11] <min|dvir|us> Nothing? Didn't think so.
[22:22:17] <sam350> timeout to check
[22:22:23] <homosaur> systemfault: https://github.com/homosaur/replico-js/blob/master/src/app.coffee
[22:22:27] <sam350> forget it man no hard feelins, just good luck to ya
[22:22:39] <min|dvir|us> sam350: I just told you I'm not using timeout.
[22:22:47] <homosaur> systemfault: i think i'm assigning the new note incorrectly or something
[22:22:53] <min|dvir|us> If you'd have paid any attention to your own blabbering, you actually produced a good idea.
[22:23:11] <min|dvir|us> $(document).focus() was exactly what I needed.
[22:23:49] <min|dvir|us> Now my code is beautiful, contains no hacks, works wonderfully, and gracefully degrades.
[22:23:52] <min|dvir|us> You have nothing on me.
[22:24:29] <sam350> what an asshole
[22:24:35] <sam350> ' I have nothing on me'
[22:24:39] <sam350> grow up you fucking child
[22:25:12] <min|dvir|us> How do I get the box model height of something, including margin, border, and padding?
[22:25:18] <min|dvir|us> Is that possible using jQuery?
[22:25:37] <wnate07> outerHeight(true)
[22:25:57] <min|dvir|us> wnate07: Thanks. :)
[22:28:23] <_zoggy_> 1.6.2 is out.. why is topic behind
[22:28:36] <min|dvir|us> This shit is fucking magical.
[22:29:35] <Davey> min|dvir|us: sometimes it seems that way, yeah.
[22:30:47] <coldhead> fotoflo: you got everything working now?
[22:31:00] <fotoflo> coldhead: yeah :-) thanks
[22:32:33] <coldhead> good job
[22:32:42] <systemfault> :)
[22:32:50] <wnate07> anyone looked at the ui taskbar dialog widget (source)?  I'm trying to get it to work without having to inherit and use the dialog class
[22:47:17] <dokma> how can .offset().top return a 0 for element that is nowhere near the top of the document? in fact webdevelopers reports top as 168px.
[22:48:19] <coldhead> is it relative to the container?
[22:48:25] <coldhead> like a parent element?
[22:48:28] <coldhead> ?offset
[22:48:29] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[22:48:36] <coldhead> hmm, apparently not
[22:48:47] <dokma> yeah, position is relative to parent
[22:48:54] <dokma> could it be because it is an iframe?
[22:49:04] <coldhead> oh i bet
[22:49:08] <coldhead> iframes are little shits
[22:49:09] <wnate07> yea
[22:49:18] <dokma> lol :D
[22:49:40] <dokma> is there any way to find the position of an iframe and move it around just like anything else?
[22:50:10] <wnate07> tried using a wrapper?
[22:50:49] <dokma> ahh.... no :D
[22:50:53] <dokma> great idea
[22:51:16] <iszak> lo #jQuery
[22:54:21] <coldhead> lo iszak
[22:55:04] <iszak> coldhead, how are you?
[22:55:18] <coldhead> quite well! how are you
[22:55:22] <iszak> merh
[22:55:27] <iszak> i'm okay
[22:55:32] <coldhead> happy sunday?
[22:55:34] <Teltariat> Hello.  So I'm trying to send a javascript map ( { key: "value" } ) via JQuery's .ajax call, but the endpoint wants the map serialized: ( "{ \"key\": \"value\" }" ).  Does jQuery have something that can help here?
[22:55:38] <coldhead> not doing it for you?
[22:55:50] <iszak> i've only been awake for 2 hours, so nothing special
[22:55:59] <coldhead> big night, iszak ?
[22:56:06] <coldhead> ?serialize @ Teltariat
[22:56:06] <bot-t> Teltariat, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[22:56:15] <coldhead> i don't know if that helps
[22:56:30] <coldhead> i thought jQuery "wrapped" "keys"
[22:56:40] <iszak> coldhead, working until 2am :/
[22:56:50] <Teltariat> coldhead: I saw that but I didn't try it because it mentioned it was for form elements, but I'll give it a shot I guess
[22:58:48] <coldhead> Teltariat: jQuery's JSON should conform to http://jsonlint.com/
[22:58:54] <iszak> coldhead, found a perm job yet?
[22:58:55] <coldhead> and that requires quoted "keys"
[22:59:07] <coldhead> hopefully iszak
[22:59:14] <coldhead> negotiations in progress
[22:59:19] <iszak> coldhead, oh nice! doing what?
[22:59:24] <coldhead> JS
[22:59:29] <iszak> lolwhat?
[22:59:37] <coldhead> J$
[22:59:39] <iszak> that's a bit unexpected.
[22:59:51] <iszak> I thought you were doing clojure, ruby, etc?
[22:59:54] <coldhead> eh. i can supply that demand
[23:00:10] <coldhead> no one will hire me for the languages i love
[23:00:13] <iszak> not that you can't, just thought you were looking for a clojure job
[23:00:16] <iszak> how com?
[23:00:17] <coldhead> but i get on well enough with js
[23:00:32] <coldhead> i am inexperienced, i guess
[23:00:35] <coldhead> and a bit of a cunt
[23:00:44] <iszak> ah, there's a bit of a cunt in all of us!
[23:00:59] <coldhead> too true
[23:01:10] <coldhead> anyway i'll take what i can get
[23:01:15] <coldhead> see how it treats me
[23:01:22] <iszak> yeah, I'm sure you'll fill the JS role well
[23:01:33] <coldhead> mmm browser testing
[23:01:35] <iszak> coldhead, client side or server side J$?
[23:01:39] <coldhead> >_>
[23:01:45] <iszak> I guess client side?
[23:01:45] <coldhead> clientside
[23:01:49] <iszak> fail :P
[23:01:54] <coldhead> although i'll see what i can talk them into
[23:02:06] <iszak> yeah fair enough
[23:02:41] <coldhead> the thing i'd most enjoy at this stage is not starving to death
[23:03:13] <iszak> almost enjoyable not to starve to death
[23:04:13] <iszak> coldhead, can you say what company it's for?
[23:04:31] <coldhead> ask me in a week? :)
[23:04:40] <iszak> or you could PM me :D
[23:04:55] <Chibby_> shhh
[23:05:14] <coldhead> nevers
[23:05:20] <iszak> interesting.
[23:05:36] <iszak> coldhead, nice company, good luck
