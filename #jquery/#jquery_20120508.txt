[00:00:03] <coldhead> onats: $('form').get(0).submit()
[00:00:15] <Whirl3d> easier than inspecting it in console when I don't know what content is going to be inside it.
[00:00:57] <ndss56> Whirl3d: I like your solution.
[00:01:03] <coldhead> i don't
[00:01:14] <ndss56> coldhead: I like yours as well.
[00:01:14] <coldhead> you're terrible people
[00:01:22] <coldhead> no, i kid
[00:01:37] <coldhead> Whirl3d's solution is nice because it works but its gross that its necessary
[00:01:48] <coldhead> it's not Whirl3d's fault
[00:01:55] <coldhead> much as i might try to blame him
[00:02:11] <Whirl3d> lol.
[00:03:06] <Whirl3d> I finally got my damned footer elements to slideup like I want them. No queueing bs, no delays, no jumpy animation garbage, no reformatting, fluid layout. I am 80% pleased.
[00:03:17] <coldhead> why only 80%!
[00:03:50] <Whirl3d> The backend shit and the modal shit isn't done.
[00:04:11] <Whirl3d> LIke I need to pop open a modal window for twitter/facebook (blech)
[00:04:34] <Whirl3d> I've coded the architecture to handle it, now I just have to do the modal parts and the php to process the forms.
[00:04:53] <Whirl3d> simple email forms, so it's not gonna be too rough.
[00:05:11] <coldhead> i'd still be more than 80% happy
[00:05:17] <coldhead> because i wouldn't be using php
[00:05:18] <coldhead> :D
[00:05:24] <Whirl3d> Plus, I'd like to add some nice drop shadows and such....you know.
[00:05:29] <Whirl3d> lol
[00:05:37] <coldhead> and as punishment i now have to fix someone else's php bug
[00:05:40] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, god
[00:05:55] <Whirl3d> php is  pretty easy, all things considered.
[00:06:31] <Whirl3d> Not that I would do it for a permanent position, but I could fumble around okay in it.
[00:07:38] <coldhead> its easy for one man to keep it sensible for himself
[00:07:52] <coldhead> it's a fucking nightmare when idiots in manila fuck up your code while you sleep
[00:07:57] <coldhead> stupid global village
[00:09:58] <Whirl3d> wow. I just had a flashback to when globalvillage was a service provider...
[00:10:33] <Whirl3d> or a modem mfg. or something...

[00:17:39] <ravenzz> thank you
[00:18:12] <coldhead> its the one the cool kids use
[00:18:18] <coldhead> wookiehangover sold me on it

[00:20:20] <ravenzz> ?ajax upload
[00:21:11] <ravenzz> the bot in not here, but it suggest a plugin from the 2007
[00:23:09] <Whirl3d> if I have several elements within a div and one of them has the mouse pointer positioned over it, can I check agains tthe parent div's ":hover" pseudoselector?  In other words, will ( if (!$(this).is(":hover")) {hideFooter()  ) work if a child element of ($(this)) is hovered over?
[00:23:34] <raj> coldhead, pretty sure I convinced you to use it
[00:23:43] <raj> but fineee, give credit to mr.hangover
[00:24:56] <raj> jquery-ui tabs doesn't have an option that puts an X in the tab so it can be removed?
[00:25:06] <raj> additionally, what about sorting the tabs?
[00:26:12] <iamntz> ravenzz: why don't you just bind mouseenter & mouseleave events on the lement you want to check?
[00:30:44] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/suther/QgNU3/
[00:31:09] <rethus> didn't work... have i to use find for css... to get "filterRows" in the div-class?
[00:31:24] <ravenzz> iamntz ^
[00:31:25] <ravenzz> ?
[00:34:36] <rethus> div[class="filterRows"]   how can i act to access even to class="something filterRows somethingElse" ?
[00:34:48] <iamntz> ravenzz: actually the message was for Whirl3d ^_^
[00:35:08] <ravenzz> ah np ;)
[00:35:10] <rethus> so if filterows is inside of class-attrib, do something...
[00:35:20] <coldhead> like hell you convinced me raj
[00:35:23] <iamntz> rethus: div[class*="filterRows"]
[00:35:28] <coldhead> wookiehangover called me on the phone
[00:35:36] <coldhead> DON'T MAKE ME GET OUT THE CALL LOGS
[00:35:49] <rethus> iamntz: thanks
[00:36:08] <iamntz> rethus: read more here: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/  and here: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[00:36:22] <coldhead> I AM GETTING OUT THE CALL LOGS
[00:37:22] <Whirl3d> Iamntz, although I could use the active element to bind the mouse events to, I have already delegated all of the other relevant events to the footerPanel. So rather than having the footerPanel (which is already listenening for mouse events) keep track of the "current" displayed footer item, I would like to just lump it in with the existing handler.
[00:38:33] <rethus> iamntz: so i also could use class~="filterRows"
[00:38:57] <rethus> so * is exactly "filterRows", and ~ is " filterRows "
[00:39:03] <rethus> whitespace before and after?!
[00:39:18] <iamntz> Whirl3d: you know you can bind same event multiple times on the same element, right?
[00:39:26] <iamntz> Whirl3d: you can also use events namespacing
[00:39:47] <Whirl3d> sure, but if you are talking about who is going to be in charge of hiding the elements, why not just make one parent element be in charge.
[00:40:03] <Whirl3d> Multiple bindings create multiple problems with animated elements.
[00:40:24] <Whirl3d> Whereas one delegated control element, handles all that shizit for ya...no conflicts of interest
[00:41:12] <iamntz> Whirl3d: afaik you can't watch things like is(':hover'). i needed that couple years ago and i wasn't able to achieve (maybe things has changedd meanwhile?)
[00:43:20] <Whirl3d> $("el").bind("mousemove", funciton (e) { if (!$(this).is(":hover")) {$(this).removeClass("active").hide().unbind("mousemove")   and some combination of }) who knows
[00:46:29] <iamntz> Whirl3d: right, but i think mousemove is more... expensive than mouseenter :)
[00:47:12] <iamntz> you can do el.bind('mouseenter.yournamespace', function()
[00:48:41] <iamntz> Whirl3d: and if you want to unbind, you can do unbind('mouseenter.yournamespance') or .unbind('*.yournamespace')
[00:51:35] <temirikov> Hi, everybody
[00:51:48] <temirikov> I have one problem with jquery
[00:53:45] <dr0id> why only one ?
[00:53:49] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[00:53:57] <temirikov> –Ω—É—ã
[00:53:59] <temirikov> yes
[00:54:07] <temirikov> one second please
[00:54:23] <temirikov> var val=document.getElementById("what").value; $(val).fadeOut(400);
[00:55:21] <temirikov> Inside element with id "what" i have a value, where i keep the name of element, which i want to hide with fade out
[00:56:10] <temirikov> then i am trying to past this value to the $(val).fadeOut(400);
[00:56:21] <temirikov> but it doesn't work
[00:56:35] <temirikov> And i dont know how to do it
[00:56:48] <coldhead> $('#' + val)
[00:57:53] <iamntz> temirikov: are you using jquery, ffs! $('#what).fadeOut()
[00:58:04] <temirikov> <coldhead>, Thank you
[00:58:06] <iamntz> temirikov: you don't have to do getElementBy*
[00:59:21] <coldhead> temirikov: i concur, let getElementByID go, embrace $('#id')
[00:59:28] <Whirl3d> iamntz, I just started to rewrite my mouse handler when I realized that the problem with your method is that on the parent element, it has to bind several namespaces for mosueenter and mouseleave. If you don't do the separate namespaces, then you trigger mosueleave when the mouse goes from one child to the next...still not leaving the parent, but signalling the mosueleave event on the parent.
[01:00:43] <Whirl3d> I didn't knwo about the unbind (.namespace) option. That's pretty cool.
[01:02:00] <Whirl3d> iamntz, maybe not. Maybe I can still check for hover on mouseleave...that would cut the number of callbacks down like you said without falsely trigger the mouseleave...
[01:09:42] <iamntz> Whirl3d: that's weird, mouseleave should not give false positives. did you used stop propagation on it's child or smth? can you upload a sample on jsfiddle?
[01:12:10] <Whirl3d> When I say false positives, I mean that because I am handling the mouse events entirely by the one parent element, I don't have the opportunity to prevent default on it's children. So it registers, bubbles, and the mouseleave event registers with the parent (which caused some problems). But now, I am working it out so that whenever the mouseleave evetn bubbles to the parent, It checks to see
[01:12:10] <Whirl3d> if it is still hovered over (by another child element presumably) before firing the mouseleave actions...
[01:12:40] <Whirl3d> I'll post it in just a couple minutes. I'm encorporating your ideas (which are great, thanks) and I'll post it as soon as I am done
[01:13:22] <iamntz> btw, try mouseout instead of mouseleave, one of these mess bubblings up, but i never remember which one ^_^
[01:21:52] <r3za> hi guys , i wrote this : $("#tooltip").css("visibility","visible").animate('slide',{direction:'right'},500); and i include jquery ui too , but it didnt work , can anyone help me ?
[01:23:36] <r3za> hi guys , i wrote this : $("#tooltip").css("visibility","visible").animate('slide',{direction:'right'},500); and i include jquery ui too , but it didnt work , can anyone help me ?
[01:24:30] <xec_> r3za: you don't have to repeat yourself, if someone was afk and comes back, they usually look at the recent chat
[01:24:53] <r3za> xec_: alright
[01:25:01] <iamntz> r3za: did you build ui correctly? i mean did you included effects?
[01:25:36] <r3za> iamntz: yup , i use it in another part and it work perfectly
[01:25:57] <xec_> r3za: what is 'slide'? i thought the 1st param should be the properties?
[01:28:13] <xec_> r3za: maybe you wanted .hide() instead of .animate() ?
[01:28:22] <cil> hi, does anybody know why this is wrong ?!? http://pastebin.com/GqhCM8K6
[01:28:32] <iamntz> r3za: i think you don't need to alter css visibilty, but display
[01:29:37] <rethus> whats the best way to check, if a div is empty or not?
[01:30:02] <xec_> cil: define wrong, what happens? make a demo, perhaps?
[01:30:26] <iamntz> r3za: actually xec_ was right, you need to use hide instead: http://jsfiddle.net/iamntz/hDj5E/
[01:30:26] <PERECil> Another cil here? :D
[01:30:33] <xec_> cil: oh wait, you're initializing the datepicker inside a change event
[01:31:17] <cil> xec_: yes, i want that becauise the beforshowday function has to run with the changed value
[01:31:33] <xec_> afk 10min
[01:31:38] <cil> it get dates out of an db
[01:32:12] <cil> PERECil another ? :)
[01:33:20] <cil> or can i trigger the beforshowday function after initiliazing ?
[01:36:51] <rethus> i have a function, which return true or false... but if(myfunction()===true) didn't work
[01:36:55] <rethus> why
[01:40:33] <Whirl3d> okay, I am unsure if I can use .prop on an attribute after I have used .removeAttr()?
[01:45:05] <xec_> ?eval function myFunction() { return true; }; if (myFunction() === true) { print("yay"); }
[01:45:06] <bot-t> xec_: "yay"
[01:45:12] <xec_> rethus: you lie!
[01:45:17] <quicksilver> Whirl3d: your question seems odd. prop is for properties, removeAttr is for attributes.
[01:45:42] <quicksilver> Whirl3d: some properties in the DOM model are "magically" connected to attributes... most are not.
[01:45:43] <Whirl3d> is disabled a property or attribute
[01:45:58] <rethus> xec_: ???
[01:46:09] <Whirl3d> Traditionally, I would use .attr('disabled')... but now I think I am suppoed to be using .prop("dislabled");
[01:46:12] <xec_> rethus: bot-t does not lie!
[01:46:37] <Whirl3d> traditionally, I would do this to enable a disable d element:   $(this).attr("disabled","").removeAttr("disabled");
[01:46:54] <xec_> rethus: i just demonstrated that your pasted snipped does work, something else is wrong
[01:47:08] <Woet> ?demo @ rethus
[01:47:08] <bot-t> rethus, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:47:16] <Whirl3d> but if ( am supposed to use .prop to signify a possible different state than the markup, what happens if I removeAttr("disabled").?
[01:47:19] <ravenz> so I have an array basically ID => Name , I sort it by name in php and I return it as a json object, why the browser sort it by ID again?
[01:47:21] <ravenz> :\
[01:47:36] <xec_> Whirl3d: how about .prop("disabled", false) or something like that
[01:47:40] <quicksilver> ravenz: objects don't have an order.
[01:47:47] <cil> xec_: wb, did you read my last message ??
[01:48:11] <ravenz> quicksilver so, isn't there a way to maintain the order?
[01:48:25] <quicksilver> Whirl3d: using removeAttr disabled will probalby also change the property, since that attribute is linked to that property. I'd have to try it to be sure. Might vary by browser.
[01:48:34] <rethus> xec_ i found the problem... and don't understand it... in my function i have a if-loop (if error=true return false, else return true... this didn't work... works only if i asign the bool to a var, and return it at the end of the function
[01:48:34] <quicksilver> ravenz: yes, don't use an object.
[01:48:40] <xec_> cli: beforeshowday is an event
[01:48:46] <quicksilver> ravenz: use an array if order matters.
[01:48:48] <Whirl3d> xec_ what is the syntax for .prop("disabled",false)....
[01:49:00] <rethus> i didn't know, why js not can sent return out of a loop, but thats the problem
[01:49:22] <cil> the datepicker has to read the availabel dates out of en db and for the select i need a variable set this ist just after the change event...
[01:49:23] <xec_> cli: it will execute the function you pass to that option for each day in the datepicker before it is displayed
[01:49:26] <ravenz> quicksilver what does it means? How can i get an array from a json ajax call
[01:49:27] <ravenz> ?
[01:49:30] <ravenz> request*
[01:49:50] <quicksilver> ravenz: I don't understand that question. Arrays are one of the basic JSON structures.
[01:49:51] <xec_> cli: if it depends on a db i suggest you get the required data and cache it first
[01:49:59] <quicksilver> ravenz: it sounds like you need to learn some javascript basics.
[01:50:21] <xec_> cli: like, before you send the page to the client on first load for instance ;)
[01:51:42] <cil> xec_: this is my function http://pastebin.com/QCKznhFm
[01:52:09] <cil> for beforeshowday.. but even when i set "tourid" global i get an erros that it is undefined...
[01:52:24] <xec_> cli: how many times do you want that function to be executed?
[01:52:47] <ravenz> quicksilver I know that but this is what the jquery doc says '"json": Evaluates the response as JSON and returns a JavaScript object'
[01:52:58] <quicksilver> ravenz: yes and that object can contain arrays, for example.
[01:53:18] <cil> xec_: sry this is the changed month function ^^ just a second...
[01:53:21] <ravenz> ah ok
[01:53:40] <xec_> cli: don't paste static code, make a demo
[01:53:44] <xec_> ?demo @ cli
[01:53:45] <bot-t> cli, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:54:21] <NodeX> what is the general accepted cross browser way to wait for a "ready" event after an Ajax request .. for example an Ajax request builds a load of new HTML into the DOM tree then binds somethign to the new HTML with the caveat being the widths are not always correct in these elements due to the page not fully rendering them yet... I have been polling but it's a waste of memory
[01:54:39] <cil> got one but its on german ;)  http://not-my.name/segway/ the go to "Touren buchen"
[01:55:02] <quicksilver> NodeX: javascript runs synchronously. As soon as your callback runs and adds the DOM, the page is fully rendered.
[01:55:13] <cil> and yeah i know the charset is wrong.. but this ist just for testing ;)
[01:55:18] <xec_> haha offroad segway, sounds like a horrible idea
[01:55:21] <xec_> ^^
[01:55:27] <cil> :D
[01:55:35] <quicksilver> NodeX: or do you mean the new elements reference other resources like imgs or iframes?
[01:56:08] <NodeX> no
[01:56:30] <xec_> cil: your fetchFreeDays is causing an error
[01:56:47] <xec_> cil: it seems to be passing nothing into the $.each()
[01:56:47] <cil> yes beacuse tourid is undefined...
[01:56:48] <NodeX> an AJax request for example adding lets say 100k of HTML to my DOM tree and I want to attach a function (plugin) to it which measures the width of one of these HTML elements... ]
[01:57:11] <quicksilver> NodeX: if it's just HTML then you can fire something as soon as its added.
[01:57:16] <cil> ah okay ?!? but if i add a static id it works...
[01:57:19] <quicksilver> NodeX: HTML is not rendered "in the background".
[01:57:21] <NodeX> However, if I immediately echo out the script the DOM has NOT finished working out the width's
[01:57:28] <quicksilver> NodeX: "immediately"
[01:57:30] <NodeX> and I get the wrong width
[01:57:35] <quicksilver> NodeX: obviously you have to wait for the ajax to complete
[01:57:43] <quicksilver> NodeX: you are in the callback?
[01:57:44] <NodeX> Err yes that's a given
[01:58:00] <NodeX> omg lol
[01:58:36] <burzum> hi
[01:58:36] <NodeX> imagine this in my call back ... <div id="foo">blah</div><script>alert($('#foo').width());)</script>
[01:58:41] <cil> xec_: i added the id static now its works..
[01:58:44] <NodeX> that would give me an incorrect width
[01:59:02] <cil> but i need it dynamic ;)
[01:59:05] <burzum> how can i open a jquery mobile dialog as overlay of the existing page? for some reason its doing it as a "new" page
[01:59:06] <NodeX> if I however poll it or set a timeout for 1 second and then ask for it's width it will be correct
[01:59:30] <quicksilver> NodeX: how is that a callback?
[01:59:38] <quicksilver> NodeX: that's a script chunk inside a piece of HTML?
[01:59:41] <NodeX> I didn't say it was a callback
[01:59:46] <NodeX> and ... ?
[02:00:02] <quicksilver> NodeX: so why did you say "imagine this in my call back" and show me a piece of HTML?
[02:00:09] <quicksilver> you're not making any sense to me :-/
[02:00:18] <quicksilver> perhaps you can paste some code so we know what we're talking about?
[02:00:22] <NodeX> my mistake... in my RESPONSE
[02:00:33] <NodeX> I just did paste some code, that is all it needs
[02:01:08] <quicksilver> for example, use http://api.jquery.com/load/ and check the widths in the callback which is the third parameter to load.
[02:01:16] <NodeX> not an option
[02:01:30] <NodeX> else I would !
[02:01:33] <xec_> cil: what happens if you console.log() the selection inside your function
[02:01:35] <quicksilver> OK, well I don't understand what you're doing.
[02:01:42] <quicksilver> HTML is not rendered in the background.
[02:01:42] <NodeX> it's not Dynamic enough
[02:01:52] <quicksilver> as long as you wait for the ajax to run, the widths will be correct.
[02:01:55] <NodeX> how can you not understand it lol, it's the most simple thing in the world
[02:02:03] <NodeX> no they are not correct
[02:02:04] <NodeX> lol
[02:02:07] <quicksilver> unless other resources - like images - are waiting to load and they will affect the DOM.
[02:02:24] <quicksilver> if it's the most simple thing in the world you obviously don't need my help with it :-P
[02:02:30] <NodeX> obviously
[02:02:35] <cil> xec_: i try it.. just a second...
[02:02:41] <NodeX> anyone else who actually knows what they are talking about care to inputv ?
[02:03:05] <NodeX> -v
[02:03:05] <xec_> NodeX: i tried to follow the conversation, but i'm as confused as quicksilver
[02:03:36] <NodeX> 1. An AJax request ... 2. In the response there is the follwing html <div id="foo">blah</div><script>alert($('#foo').width());)</script>
[02:03:50] <NodeX> that will report the incorrect width
[02:03:59] <cil> xec_: sry is that write what i just did ? ;)
[02:04:09] <cil>   $.each(data, function(index, value) {
[02:04:09] <cil>             console.log();
[02:04:22] <NodeX> If however we wait a second or 2 then it will be the correct width as the DOM has properly added it and worked out it's width
[02:04:24] <xec_> cil: no
[02:05:08] <xec_> cil: the selection is something like $("#myID") - so to log that you'd do console.log($("myID")); and check the console to see what you get
[02:05:29] <xec_> i forgot the # in there but you get the idea
[02:05:47] <cil> ah you mean where i select the "tourid" ?
[02:06:15] <xec_> cil: yes, to make sure that part works
[02:06:35] <Trisox> http://getfirebug.com/logging
[02:07:38] <quicksilver> NodeX: with an attitude like that I frankly hope no one helps you. Being rude to people who are spending time trying to help you is really strange.
[02:07:43] <gain_> hi all√π
[02:07:45] <gain_> *all
[02:08:22] <NodeX> How am I being rude
[02:08:34] <cil> xec_: it's in...
[02:08:41] <NodeX> You stated that I dont need help to which I replied "Obviously"
[02:08:41] <quicksilver> NodeX: "anyone else who actually knows what they are talking about"
[02:08:49] <NodeX> well you dont know what you're talking about
[02:08:50] <Flo0815> hey how can i assign a value to a variable using OR: var test = test2 : 'abc' ?
[02:08:55] <NodeX> stating a fact is not rudeness
[02:08:55] <xec_> NodeX: noone does
[02:09:19] <NodeX> I was pointing out that you don't know what you are talking about
[02:09:22] <gain_> can't find how to manage $.post non standard response, like 302 (I see 302 resposnse instead of 200 in firebug if the session expires...) I need to redirect to the login page again, in this case...
[02:09:35] <quicksilver> NodeX: I know quite well what I'm talking about; even if I didn't it would be rude; even if you don't think it's rude, it is certainly decreasing your chance of getting help.
[02:09:56] <izepstan> what about everyTime? http://jsfiddle.net/XDXJQ/
[02:10:02] <NodeX> Evidently you don't else you would know the aswer
[02:10:05] <NodeX> answer*
[02:10:49] <NodeX> it's ok to not know the answer but blaming lack of knowledge on the person asking the question is rude in itself
[02:11:00] <Flo0815> can someone explain the meaning of : ?
[02:11:16] <cil> xec_: it seems to be working...
[02:11:20] <xec_> NodeX: i agree with quicksilver about the attitude, keep it civil, short and to the point ;) if noone knows the answer maybe it could be helpful to actually see the issue in action, it should be easy enough to make a demo?
[02:11:41] <NodeX> I am being civil, and to the point lol
[02:11:44] <xec_> cil: ok, are you able to log the correct ID to the console?
[02:11:53] <cil> xec_: the logging ;)
[02:11:58] <cil> yes
[02:12:01] <NodeX> I just gave a demo, it's as short as that, it really is
[02:12:06] <xec_> NodeX: no you're complaining about people not understanding what you're talking about, which is less than useful
[02:12:14] <NodeX> cool story
[02:12:19] <xec_> NodeX: static code is not a "demo"
[02:12:36] <NodeX> if "whoever is answering" does not know the answer to the problem then there is no point in making a demo
[02:12:41] <NodeX> they either know it or dont
[02:12:52] <NodeX> it's not a problem fixable by a demo
[02:13:25] <NodeX> it's effectivly a document.ready for an ajax response
[02:13:41] <Flo0815> hey can someone tell me what's wrong about this: {path: page.imagesequence.path !== 'undefined' ? page.imagesequence.path : 'data/images/sequence/'}
[02:13:57] <NodeX> errr .. curly braces
[02:14:08] <Flo0815> it's assigning all the time the value of page.imagesequence.path
[02:14:14] <NodeX> you can't execute JS inside json
[02:14:15] <Flo0815> it's in a abject
[02:14:21] <Flo0815> *object
[02:14:29] <Flo0815> var test = {path: page.imagesequence.path !== 'undefined' ? page.imagesequence.path : 'data/images/sequence/',}
[02:14:33] <NodeX> not like that anyway
[02:14:34] <xec_> cil: and you're using the exact same code (in the exact same place) to pass the ID to the http request?
[02:15:28] <Flo0815> so what's wrong? or what would be a solution?
[02:15:47] <NodeX> and secondly xec : I already know one answer to it because it's how I do it already, my question was "what is the common approach" to see if I missed anything
[02:16:12] <xec_> Flo0815: maybe { path: page.imagesequence.path || 'data/images/sequence/' } ?
[02:16:43] <Flo0815> nice :) thx!
[02:16:56] <xec_> Flo0815: haven't tested that though :p
[02:17:31] <cil> xec_: hm i use this to set tourid after very change of the select box if i copy this in my function where i get my data it get the same error...
[02:17:37] <Flo0815> xec_: but it's working :)
[02:17:43] <xec_> awesome :)
[02:18:44] <NodeX> ?getReadyList
[02:18:46] <bot-t> NodeX, Couldn't find "getReadyList" in jQuery Docs.
[02:19:24] <NodeX> ?readyList
[02:19:26] <bot-t> NodeX, $().ready() assumes nothing is added to $.readyList during ... - Opened 3 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5209
[02:20:18] <xec_> cil: i believe it is because you execute the function before the DOM is ready
[02:20:52] <xec_> cil: meaning the source of the id will be unavailable
[02:20:58] <cil> xec_: but this is in the Document ready function
[02:21:48] <xec_> cil: how sure are you about that, when i looked at the code earlier it wasn't ;)
[02:22:40] <cil> hm it's an own function that woud be executed in the document rdy function and after every side change.. or can i make for an ajax side change another document rdy function ?!?!
[02:23:24] <NodeX> Lol ... that's about 95% similar to my question!!¬¨
[02:24:45] <cil> xec_: you know what i mean ? ;)
[02:25:10] <xec_> cil: i'm afraid not
[02:26:38] <cil> xec_: the page load is dynamic and the document rdy fucntion only passes once if the page is loaded right ?!?! because that i have en extra function that is called when a side change is triggerd but this fucntion dont what for document rdy and thats why my code is executed befor the dom is rdy
[02:26:55] <guy> I have a small problem here. This doesn't work. $('.template.home > .body').on('click', '[data-uid]', function()
[02:26:57] <cil> xec_: but i downt know how i can solve this...
[02:27:22] <xec_> cil: the first call to the function is at the top of your js file, before doc ready
[02:27:23] <guy> I am trying to bind dynamic elements with data uid.
[02:27:30] <xec_> cil: move it inside
[02:28:15] <NodeX> cli : trigger("ready"); ... and bind to ready
[02:29:17] <cil> xec_: sure ? i dont see it outside... line 34 and line 38 the rdy fucntion is closed..
[02:29:31] <cil> nodex: sry dont get it :D
[02:30:11] <cil> ahhhh
[02:30:21] <cil> xec_: see it ;)
[02:31:21] <D4> How can I make a absolute positioned element within a relative one to acts as if it were fixed (but not relative to the document but the parent element which is relative)?
[02:32:04] <D4> I basically want the "button" to scroll with the element it resides in
[02:32:11] <Hooloovoo> D4: set it as absolute.
[02:32:17] <Hooloovoo> oh
[02:32:28] <D4> It is already, but I want it "fixed" but within the relative (which doesn't work)
[02:32:30] <Hooloovoo> that's tricky
[02:32:35] <D4> it sure is ;p
[02:32:39] <Hooloovoo> well
[02:32:44] <Hooloovoo> you could just overlay it
[02:32:44] <cil> xec_: but still getting the error :(
[02:33:11] <D4> Hooloovoo ª overlay it?
[02:33:12] <Hooloovoo> like putting it on a second layer about the div it's gonna be "fixed" agains
[02:33:51] <xec_> cil: sorry mate, i gotta go, be back later - someone else might be able to help if you restate the question to the channel and link to the page again *afk*
[02:34:32] <guy> How do I concatenate two jQuery objects into one, like $('<div />').data('uid', 1) + $('<p />'). The expected result being jQuery object $('<div /></p>')
[02:34:42] <guy> with the data still associated.
[02:34:44] <D4> Hooloovoo ª Right now it's article > div > section + section > nav > ul where section is relative and nav is absolute
[02:34:48] <gain_> how can I manage if a $.post returns a 302 instead of a 200?
[02:35:00] <cil> xec_: okay, thank you at all
[02:35:16] <stenno|work> hey xec_ :)
[02:35:28] <Hooloovoo> D4: sec
[02:35:54] <zulu-gula> how would it be to build gallery like this one: http://www.jamesdayphoto.com/ using jquery? isn't it too dynamic?
[02:36:59] <quicksilver> guy: look at the jquery functions after or insertAfter
[02:37:13] <Hooloovoo> D4: http://jsfiddle.net/
[02:37:16] <Hooloovoo> that should work
[02:37:36] <Hooloovoo> ummm
[02:37:44] <Hooloovoo> http://jsfiddle.net/mVQWW/
[02:37:45] <Hooloovoo> there
[02:38:22] <Hooloovoo> the .second div overlaps the .first and you can have like overflow: scroll on the .first div
[02:38:29] <Hooloovoo> the .second will still stay in that place tho
[02:41:04] <D4> Hooloovoo ª So, I'm not quite following your example - it's always right 0 bottom 0, it doesn't 'scroll' with the wrapper or so
[02:41:23] <D4> .wrap { width: 600px; height: 1200px; ... } say I'd do that
[02:41:58] <Hooloovoo> if you set the .first height to 10000px
[02:42:06] <Hooloovoo> and then set overflow: scroll on .wrap
[02:42:24] <Hooloovoo> you'll be able to scroll the .first div and have static stuff on top of it in .second
[02:43:05] <cil> is it valid to initialzie a datepicker in a change function ?!?
[02:43:21] <D4> Hooloovoo ª Well, I'm not looking for a second scroll in the scroll though
[02:43:44] <Hooloovoo> zulu-gula: it would take some time, but definately doable
[02:44:06] <zulu-gula> Hooloovoo:  but what wit efficiency - wouldn't it be slow?
[02:44:07] <Whirl3d> I'm getting a running cycle of errors that say that object object has no method on. But when I log the "object", it's clearly a jquery object.
[02:44:17] <Hooloovoo> zulu-gula: in old browsers, yes
[02:44:39] <Hooloovoo> zulu-gula: it would probably be ok in newer ones if you code it right.
[02:45:05] <Hooloovoo> D4: i have no idea what you are trying to do then. make a jsfiddle
[02:47:19] <mattyh88> how can i disable a form submit button after clicking it? I just tried setting the disabled attr in the onclick event of the event, it's not clickable anymore but the form doesn't get submitted
[02:48:15] <cil> mattyh88: do return a false ?
[02:48:19] <cil> you
[02:48:24] <mattyh88> instead of disabling it?
[02:48:43] <cil> now at the and of yout click function
[02:48:52] <cil> no ^^
[02:48:58] <mattyh88> ah, i'll try
[02:49:13] <mattyh88> what does that do exactly? :p
[02:49:42] <D4> http://jsfiddle.net/7EVuG/ <--- how do I make the "more" and "less" buttons to scroll with the element? (not the page).
[02:49:42] <mattyh88> no still doesn't work
[02:49:50] <D4> Hooloovoo ª err, there's the fiddle
[02:49:53] <cil> sry i meant have you a line that say retun false ; ? bcause this will cause that your fomr woudnt submited
[02:50:47] <mattyh88> ah no
[02:50:49] <mattyh88> don't have that :)
[02:51:16] <cil> otherwise use the $('#target').submit(function() { and diable the buton inside...
[02:52:14] <temirikov> Hi
[02:52:28] <mattyh88> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/05/disable-submit-button-on-form-submit.html
[02:52:28] <mattyh88> i've done exactly this .. and not working :(
[02:52:45] <temirikov> 1 hour ago i asked about problem with jquery
[02:52:49] <mattyh88> ah no sorry
[02:53:19] <temirikov> but the irc has't answered fo 40 minutes i think
[02:53:32] <cil> you get it ?
[02:53:35] <temirikov> That's why please help me again if it is possible
[02:53:47] <Hooloovoo> D4: separate your problem and make it obvious in the fiddle. that makes no sense to me.
[02:54:10] <Hooloovoo> i have no idea what element you're talking about and i can't see a scrolling element.
[02:54:48] <Hooloovoo> D4: best way is rewriting the code from scratch to just include your example in it's most basic way.
[02:54:58] <temirikov> i have val=document.getElementById("addph"); in this variable i have one value
[02:55:11] <Hooloovoo> lunch! bbl.
[02:55:41] <temirikov> next time i want to use this value for $(val).fadeOut(400);
[02:56:07] <D4> Hooloovoo ª http://jsfiddle.net/7EVuG/1/ <-- that's as basic it gets. The "more" button to the right is absolute, it needs to scroll with its parent not the page itself.
[02:57:03] <temirikov> Please somebody, help ME!!!!
[02:57:05] <D4> I was thinking to calc the parent article offset top and increase the top: value; of the "nav" (more button) and move it on $(window).scroll
[02:57:26] <gain_> I've found $.ajaxSetup ({complete: function (xhr, textStatus) { if (xhr.status == 302) { location.href="loginpage";}});
[02:57:32] <quicksilver> temirikov: I read your comments, but I don't know what your question is.
[02:57:42] <quicksilver> temirikov: does $(val).fadeOut(400) not work for you?
[02:57:53] <temirikov> yes, it doesnt work
[02:58:03] <temirikov> I will —É—á–∑–¥—Ñ—à—Ç –Ω—â–≥
[02:58:10] <quicksilver> temirikov: it should work fine. Do you get an error message? can you paste your code?
[02:58:12] <temirikov> I will explain it to you
[02:58:29] <quicksilver> temirikov: (document.getElementById("addph") would normally be $('#addph') in jquery, but that shouldn't stop it working)
[02:58:34] <temirikov> var val=document.getElementById("addph");
[02:58:34] <temirikov> $(val).fadeOut(400);
[02:58:46] <temirikov> There is my code
[02:58:48] <cil> does anybody how i can relize that the datepicker will be initialized with an id that the users can pick in an drop down ?
[02:58:56] <cil> * know
[02:59:11] <gain_> temirikov:  have you tried $('#addph').fadeOut(400);
[02:59:13] <gain_> ?
[02:59:13] <cil> i have a demo ;)
[02:59:28] <quicksilver> temirikov: do you get an error? that code is fine.
[02:59:37] <quicksilver> or it looks fine to me.
[02:59:47] <gain_> quicksilver: to me too
[03:00:01] <temirikov> can i do it:$(document.getElementById("addph")).fadeOut(400);
[03:00:09] <stenno|work> yes but it doesn't matter
[03:00:11] <jonnu> $('#satan').remove();
[03:00:16] <stenno|work> those three things all mean the same
[03:00:44] <quicksilver> temirikov: look it works fine - http://jsfiddle.net/WGud5/
[03:02:20] <temirikov> No
[03:02:34] <temirikov> I am sorry, but you didnt understand me
[03:03:03] <temirikov> It is my mistake
[03:03:09] <temirikov> I have this: val=document.getElementById("addph").value;
[03:03:31] <soee> hi, how can i get closest element from whole DOM to some other element ?
[03:03:43] <temirikov> Then i would like to do it: $(val).fadeOut(400);
[03:03:44] <cil> why oyu do't use $('#myid').val() ?
[03:04:02] <stenno|work> soee, you can't, iirc, at least not without bruteforce
[03:04:29] <stenno|work> do you mean markup closeness or physical closeness, e.g. after css and such
[03:05:53] <quicksilver> temirikov: you can't get back from 'value' to element
[03:06:01] <quicksilver> temirikov: well, not easily. it's a strange thing to do.
[03:06:06] <soee> stenno|work, if user click on checkbox some divs should be hidden (they are inside other container and this container i want to get) but checkbox is nested inside some lists and divs and my container is outside of them
[03:06:09] <quicksilver> you could search for things with that value, but why?
[03:07:29] <temirikov> I only want to get value
[03:07:47] <temirikov> And past it into the $(val).fadeOut(400);‚Äã
[03:07:53] <temirikov> Is it impossible
[03:08:28] <temirikov> ?
[03:08:35] <quicksilver> you can do
[03:09:01] <quicksilver> $('[value="'+val+'"]').fadeOut(400)
[03:09:10] <quicksilver> but this is a very odd thing to do, why are you basing it on value?
[03:09:36] <temirikov> In is necessary to me
[03:09:38] <cil> think he will enter the name of the object fade it out
[03:09:58] <temirikov> THank you <quicksilver>, you helped me very much!
[03:09:58] <cil> enter in an inut or something like that
[03:10:37] <cil> quicksilver are you interested in a nice other problem ? :D
[03:12:07] <camslice> hey guys, can anyone tell me at a glance why 'item' is undefined in this custom implementation of the jQuery UI autocomplete using JSON data source? http://hastebin.com/digoqereqi.coffee

[03:23:12] <temirikov> on http://jsfiddle.net/WGud5/4/ it works perfectly
[03:24:54] <temirikov> Aaaaaaa, help
[03:26:11] <quicksilver> temirikov: you are making no sense at all.
[03:26:23] <quicksilver> temirikov: you told me you wanted to find things with a certain value?
[03:26:37] <quicksilver> but in that snipped you're seraching by ID, not value.
[03:26:57] <quicksilver> use $('#'+val) if you want to search by ID, certainly.

[03:37:03] <adedommelin> Hi, small question : I'm using $.ajax() to call a quite long php procedure which output continuously information. I'd like to show these information inside a div without waiting for all the process to complete is it possible ?
[03:38:15] <adedommelin> i'm currently using a .html() at success level, but obviously it triggers at the end of my "background script" execution
[03:39:10] <stenno|work> adedommelin, i think you can bind on progress
[03:39:17] <stenno|work> please read the $.ajax docs
[03:40:10] <adedommelin> stenno|work: i've read the ajax page but didn't find mention of progress :S
[03:40:27] <stenno|work> hmm
[03:40:29] <xec_> haven't heard of it either
[03:40:42] <xec_> i found this though http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7740646/jquery-ajax-read-the-stream-incrementally
[03:41:47] <stenno|work> hmm strange
[03:41:53] <adedommelin> xec_: also found it but was wondering if there was a "built-in" way to do this using jquery
[03:42:11] <xec_> not that i know of
[03:42:48] <xec_> but don't take my word for it, i never actually tried ;)
[03:43:49] <stenno|work> oh i mixed up with websockets >_>"
[03:43:51] <stenno|work> my bad o/
[03:53:05] <soee> i have few divs that creates grid 4xX elements, if usere pick some options new divs can show up or some of them are hidden, is it possible to make the visible divs (after some were hidden) fly on their new position?

[03:54:03] <joobie> hey guys.. is there an easy to use jquery module / code that can present a table with multiple columns, sortable when you click the header and an index at the bottom to allow for multiple pages?
[03:54:04] <stenno|work> also, it is
[03:54:12] <stenno|work> soee, look up $.animate
[04:04:00] <eshlox> it's possible to copy href value of link (after click) to clipboard using js/jquery but without swf? ;-S
[04:06:46] <nlogax> there is a clipboard api, eshlox. i known't about browser support.
[04:06:56] <nlogax> http://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/
[04:08:33] <nlogax> i know i used it in spotify but i don't remember which parts were standard awful html5 d&d and which parts were custom hax
[04:10:17] <joobie>  is there an easy to use jquery module / code that can present a table with multiple columns, sortable when you click the header and an index at the bottom to allow for multiple pages?
[04:11:10] <nlogax> joobie: perhaps this? http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[04:11:26] <nlogax> it has a pagination addon
[04:12:46] <joobie> thanks nlogax it's almost perfect
[04:12:49] <joobie> what if i want to edit a row
[04:12:52] <joobie> is there a plugin for that?
[04:12:58] <nlogax> dunno :)
[04:13:33] <joobie> i suppose i could put an edit button in there
[04:13:36] <joobie> in the td
[04:13:42] <joobie> with <a href>
[04:14:18] <nlogax> you could write an addon for it, if you go with that plugin, and share the love
[04:14:52] <coldhead> yeah that's totally going to happen
[04:15:10] <joobie> im new to jquery
[04:15:23] <joobie> still trying to wrap my head around it
[04:15:30] <joobie> writing an addon will be a challenge this early on
[04:19:32] <cil> Have a problem with datepicker and a variable, has anybody time ? ;)
[04:27:47] <cil> why i get an undefined although the variable is set global ?
[04:28:03] <stenno|work> because javascript?
[04:29:50] <cil> stenno|work ?
[04:30:19] <stenno|work> global variables in js is a no-no
[04:30:26] <cil> also i set it in the function but its still undefined...
[04:30:30] <stenno|work> especially when using jquery
[04:30:48] <stenno|work> you can use $.extend for something like global variables
[04:30:49] <cil>  $.getJSON("include/gettouren.php?id="+ tourid, function(data){
[04:30:49] <nlogax> which is a global variable, coincidentally
[04:31:10] <stenno|work> yes
[04:31:15] <cil> var tourid = 0; tourid = $( "#tour" ).val();
[04:31:23] <stenno|work> that sounds good
[04:31:51] <stenno|work> var is local
[04:31:55] <cil> but still get an error a is null
[04:32:00] <stenno|work> a ?
[04:32:27] <cil> yeah i tested both gloabl and in the function
[04:32:34] <stenno|work> no i mean, a ?
[04:32:37] <stenno|work> what a?
[04:33:08] <cil> http://not-my.name/segway/ selct "Touren Buchen"
[04:33:45] <stenno|work> if it complains about 'a', tourid is not the problem, no?
[04:34:50] <cil> sot, if i replace the tourid with a sting it works..
[04:34:51] <stenno|work> oh from some minified js
[04:34:55] <stenno|work> so
[04:35:14] <cil> after i set the variable jquery respond an erros in line 2 a is missing if i hit the plus ther is a line that says
[04:35:16] <cil> 	"include/gettouren.php?id=undefined"
[04:35:45] <stenno|work> soo
[04:35:49] <stenno|work> thats makes me think
[04:35:57] <stenno|work> that $("#tour).val() is undefined?
[04:36:35] <stenno|work> >>> $("#tour").val();
[04:36:36] <stenno|work> undefined
[04:36:37] <xec|work> deja vu
[04:36:48] <shoky> vuja de
[04:36:57] <stenno|work> jade vu?
[04:37:02] <shoky> nu nu nu
[04:37:05] <cil> hm its possible because the sidechange but i dont know how i can excetue it after the the ajax has finisht to load the new page
[04:37:11] <xec|work> stenno|work: i think cil and me had this exact discussion about 2 hrs ago
[04:37:17] <stenno|work> oh i see
[04:37:23] <cil> because the document rdy function is only could on the first time...
[04:37:58] <cil> xec|work yes but i still dont get how i can call the initialize after the new site dom is rdy....
[04:38:10] <stenno|work> use .live maybe
[04:38:20] <cil> i dont rtigger ne function before document rdy...
[04:38:22] <stenno|work> i don't really know
[04:38:43] <xec|work> cil: i think there's a bit too much code on your live page to be able to understand how everything works intuitively, are you able to reproduce your issue in a fiddle? you can simulate database calls with settimeout and dummy data for instance
[04:39:13] <cil> xec|work coud try it.. ;)
[04:39:38] <xec|work> cil: only include the parts that are essential for this one issue, leave the rest
[04:40:01] <cil> xec|work okay i try it ;)
[04:40:35] <shoky> the art of fiddling
[04:41:39] <coldhead> violin?
[04:41:41] <xec|work> it really is an art isn't it, just make sure to avoid infinite loops so you don't have to close the tab and lose your changes! :D
[04:41:59] * xec|work sighs
[04:42:42] <cil> xec|work is it okay wenn i make a test site ?!? with just the issue...
[04:42:53] <cil> think im faster with this ;)
[04:43:11] <shoky> you can be slow
[04:43:14] <xec|work> cil: jsfiddle is much better, so we can edit the script to test ourselves more easily
[04:43:17] <shoky> you want the help to be good, no
[04:43:33] <cil> okay
[04:44:44] <stenno|work> jsfiddling is a art
[04:45:14] <cil> i choose onload ? and put my document rdy function inside ?
[04:45:30] <xec|work> cil: choose no wrap (head)
[04:45:40] <cil> k, thx
[04:48:45] <EdwardIII> hrm weird, followed the docs for fancybox but i'm seeing Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'onCleanup'
[04:49:19] <stenno|work> is that event binding?
[04:49:37] <stenno|work> if yes, use $(myobject).bind("cleanup", mycallback);
[04:50:36] <EdwardIII> stenno|work: well it's a plugin, jQuery fancybox
[04:50:45] <EdwardIII> looks like there's possibly a bug report actually: http://code.google.com/p/fancybox/issues/detail?id=98
[04:50:52] <stenno|work> ooh sorry, right
[04:54:09] <stenno|work> oh nice i can include jquery-ui in jsfiddle
[04:55:49] <EdwardIII> yeppers
[04:58:47] <Zhy> Hey everyone do I have to manually "display" the response to a jQuery-ui autoComplete call? I see in firebug that I get the correct response, but nothing is displayed (there should be a dropdown or something below the focused input field , shouldn't it ? )
[04:59:42] <stenno|work> hmm so i am using jquery-ui datepicker. i have specified an alt field (text input), and the showOn: "button" option. my datepicker element is a div. what i want is when i _click_ the div, it should show the datepicker calendar, however, it is already displayed when the page is loading. what am i doing wrong?
[05:00:23] <stenno|work> i have prepared a little jsfiddle, where the same problem occurs http://jsfiddle.net/Mf4cH/
[05:03:06] <stenno|work> as a workaround i might call hide at document.ready
[05:03:12] <D4> http://jsfiddle.net/7EVuG/3/ <-- how can I make this run smoother?
[05:03:37] <D4> It's the bottom most extended function which alters the "top" css attribute, it stutters like crazy
[05:05:20] <D4> Anyone got any suggestions?
[05:07:01] <stenno|work> ooh nevermind, stupid me
[05:07:09] <stenno|work> For an inline calendar, simply attach the datepicker to a div or span.
[05:07:11] <stenno|work> >_>"
[05:12:03] <cil> xec|work: why does the calender not show up ? http://jsfiddle.net/RAC3a/1/
[05:13:22] <xec|work> cil: what is this "newDom" function?
[05:13:37] <xec|work> and where does it end
[05:14:01] <D4> xec|work ª Might I trouble you for some thought on how to improve the scrolling stutter for the button on http://jsfiddle.net/7EVuG/4/ ?
[05:14:25] <xec|work> hit the TidyUp button to see what i mean
[05:14:49] <cil> k i cahnged this.. http://jsfiddle.net/RAC3a/4/
[05:15:03] <soee> someone who have some experience with jq tools Validator ?
[05:16:24] <cil> the newdom() function is because i have to load some code at every side refresh.. propably this is wrong ^^
[05:20:18] <xec|work> D4: like, choppy animation? or the white flash in chrome?
[05:20:58] <xec|work> oh i see
[05:21:08] <xec|work> the button doesnt jump in firefox, only chrome
[05:21:28] <xec|work> if you do it with css position fixed it should be fine
[05:22:24] <D4> xec|work ª I know, I want to use fixed but that doesn't work in my case as it only has to be relative to the parent, e.g. only scroll within the parent 'section'.
[05:22:34] <D4> Having it fixed makes it relative to the entire document and scrolls with it
[05:22:43] <D4> hence my poor attempt at creating that function
[05:24:23] <xec|work> should be doable with either some z-index trickery or having it fixed only when you want it to stay put (like apple store cart type thing)
[05:26:00] <D4> xec|work ª how do you mean z-index trickery? I tried overflow: hidden; on the parent element hoping it would hide the "buttons" when scrolling, but as said fixed is relative to the document and won't care what I do it seems :p
[05:26:20] <cil> xec|work closed the function.. but the datepicker won't work in the fiddle...
[05:26:28] <D4> Any other ideas? I was thinking of setting it to "fixed" only when I 'wanted', but not entirely sure how to check for it "being in the parent"
[05:27:09] <Zhy> What could be the reason that autoComplete doesn't display the returned JSON data?
[05:27:14] <Zhy> Jquery-ui autocomplete
[05:27:19] <xec|work> cil: yeah i'm looking, gimme a min
[05:27:29] <cil> yes no stress ;)
[05:27:53] <shoky> aaaaaaaa
[05:28:03] <Zhy> there's only an iti bitty strip of white below my input, like a too narrow div with no content
[05:28:05] <xec|work> cil: it seems to work when i remove all the other code; http://jsfiddle.net/RAC3a/5/
[05:30:21] <cil> on my main side now i get an error "ba is undefined" does anybody knows what that means ?
[05:30:32] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ cil
[05:30:38] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[05:30:41] <xec|work> yeah, it means ba is not defined
[05:30:41] <xec|work> :D
[05:30:47] <cil> ;)
[05:30:48] <Eviltwin> cil: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[05:31:01] <Eviltwin> Read through those
[05:31:06] <Eviltwin> It'll help you fix the problem
[05:32:50] <D4> xec|work ª Any idea why the choppy animation occurs?
[05:33:10] <xec|work> animation, like the sliding, or the jumping button?
[05:34:39] <D4> xec|work ª The jumping button, I want it to follow the "parent element"
[05:35:04] <D4> Weird it's in webkit but not gecko >_<
[05:35:18] <xec|work> yeah, you're constantly setting the position, it's a common issue - dunno how gecko manages to handle it tbh
[05:35:37] <xec|work> the only fix i know of is css position fixed
[05:35:51] <D4> Yeah, but how'd I make sure it's only 'fixed' within the parent element?
[05:36:05] <xec|work> i'm not sure what that means
[05:36:20] <D4> as in, setting it to fixed now and it follows the entire page
[05:36:40] <xec|work> you know what z-index does?
[05:37:02] <D4> Sure, yes. So the z-index of the "buttons" needs to be less than the other elements for them to 'disappear' behind them?
[05:37:11] <xec|work> yes, that's the theory
[05:39:28] <unclemantis> little help on ui.autocomplete
[05:39:54] <unclemantis> how do i blank out the textbox if i unfocus and then focus back into the textbox
[05:40:28] <D4> xec|work ª Well, I've tried setting the <nav> to e.g. z-index: 2; and then the above and below 'sections' or 'articles' to much higher, but the buttons are still visible as it seems to ignore the z-index completely. Any idea? :)
[05:40:38] <xec|work> unclemantis: empty it on focus?
[05:40:46] <unclemantis> when using the focus event setting the textbox to '' is not working
[05:41:09] <xec|work> D4: hmm, could you link to a demo with that so i could inspect?
[05:41:21] <xec|work> ?demo @ unclemantis
[05:41:27] <xec|work> dammit bot-t
[05:41:44] * biberao gives xec|work a lollypop
[05:41:49] <unclemantis> xec|work what i want to do is click the textbox, it blanks out if it contains something, and then i type and it autocompletes when i select the list.... When i click out of the textbox and then i click back into it, it will blank out, you know, reset
[05:41:54] <xec|work> unclemantis: do you have a live demo of your code in action?
[05:42:13] <unclemantis> i have a coffeescript
[05:42:29] <stenno|work> my sympathies
[05:42:31] <xec|work> sure, i think jsfiddle has support for that now
[05:42:36] <unclemantis> which i can convert back to jquery
[05:42:46] <xec|work> lolwut
[05:42:47] <unclemantis> little help with jsfiddle?
[05:43:04] <unclemantis> let me see if i can figure this out
[05:43:17] <xec|work> unclemantis: go to jsfiddle.net and on the left hand side click panels
[05:43:30] <xec|work> unclemantis: instead of javascript you have the option to use coffescript
[05:43:37] <guy> I have this question about jQuery and concatenating HTML objects, if someone can take a look
[05:43:38] <guy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10498839/concatenating-jquery-objects
[05:43:42] <unclemantis> let me convert it first i guess
[05:43:54] <xec|work> to what, exactly
[05:44:05] <unclemantis> javascript
[05:44:07] <D4> xec|work ª Absolutely, any chance I can send it to you?
[05:44:12] <xec|work> ok, if you want
[05:44:34] <xec|work> D4: i'd appreciate a url
[05:44:45] <NodeX> Cross-domain AJAX: "It's Not Possible" <--- false .. source http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide45
[05:44:56] <D4> xec|work ª http://npp-dev.se/sciencepark/ <-- that's the dev version, think you've seen it before. If you inspect it there you'll see them being absolute now (the <nav>) but you can change it in inspection to fixed and see what I mean with z-indexing etc
[05:45:38] <andr0id1> hi, i have a question, it might sound silly...we are building ERP from scratch, can anyone point me on some resource where i can see the whole structure, db's, diagrams...?
[05:46:47] <stenno|work> NodeX, cross-domain client requests wont work without stuff like jsonp
[05:46:49] <xec|work> guy: see the comment you got on SO, it links to a question that is already answered
[05:46:50] <unclemantis> xec|work here is my jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/NP8ea/
[05:46:58] <unclemantis> i don't have it working with local data though :(
[05:46:59] <guy> xec|work: See my reply.
[05:47:05] <NodeX> They do lol, 2 lines in Nginx config and boom working
[05:47:16] <stenno|work> jsonp
[05:47:24] <unclemantis> but you can see what i mean with line 5 of of the Javascript
[05:47:38] <unclemantis> that is not doing what i would expect it to do
[05:48:03] <NodeX> those same 2 lines allow the current document to act as document origin too
[05:48:10] <xec|work> guy: you can still use the answer, .add() is what you want
[05:48:24] <stenno|work> NodeX, normal cross-domain AJAX request _wont work_ without preperation
[05:48:33] <guy> xec|work: How is that going to work?
[05:48:35] <stenno|work> NodeX, and that is what this slide says
[05:48:55] <stenno|work> note that there it says: "There are workarounds"
[05:49:00] <NodeX> no the slide says "It's not possible"
[05:49:05] <NodeX> which is misleading
[05:49:05] <stenno|work> nginx is on the server side
[05:49:13] <andr0id1> can anyone help me with my question?
[05:49:16] <stenno|work> hmm you are looking at a different slide then
[05:49:25] <stenno|work> i read here "Yes, there are workarounds"
[05:49:32] <stenno|work> maybe it doesn't get rendered for you
[05:49:36] <NodeX> down the slide yes it does say that
[05:49:39] <stenno|work> yes
[05:49:47] <NodeX> at the top it says what I pasted
[05:49:49] <stenno|work> there is same-domain origin
[05:49:57] <stenno|work> policy
[05:50:10] <xec|work> guy: $("").add("body") <-- does that answer your question?
[05:50:16] <stenno|work> unless you prepare on the server side, Its not possible
[05:50:20] <stenno|work> that is a true statement
[05:50:34] <NodeX> that's perhaps what it should say then lol
[05:50:42] <stenno|work> it does
[05:50:49] <unclemantis> xec|work hello?
[05:50:56] <stenno|work> You simply cannot make a basic AJAX request of any arbitrary resource
[05:50:59] <NodeX> funny how it doesn't but you say it does
[05:51:01] <stenno|work> that is a true statement
[05:51:10] <stenno|work> Yes, there are workarounds:
[05:51:12] <xec|work> unclemantis: hold on, one thing at a time ;)
[05:51:14] <stenno|work> that is a true statement too
[05:51:24] <NodeX> It's misleading is all I am saying
[05:51:41] <stenno|work> well its hard to say its misleading if its a single slide
[05:51:52] <unclemantis> xec|work from what I am reading it SHOULD WORK
[05:52:09] <NodeX> not really.. I read it and it mislead me
[05:52:18] <stenno|work> NodeX, then you have to read the rest of the slide...
[05:52:24] <NodeX> or it tried to make me believe it's not possible
[05:52:29] <stenno|work> you seem to have read only the title
[05:52:32] <NodeX> I dont 'have' to do anything
[05:52:41] <stenno|work> you _have_
[05:52:47] <stenno|work> otherwise it wont work
[05:52:52] <stenno|work> on the server side
[05:52:54] <EdwardIII> hrm, how can i keep the mouseover state all the way down to the bottom edge of the blue box? http://jsfiddle.net/fRnb6/
[05:53:00] <NodeX> \n is not punctuation ;)
[05:53:19] <stenno|work> hmm?
[05:53:27] <andr0id1> anyone?
[05:53:37] <BoulderDave> I'm looking for a similar plugin to jquery auto-suggestions, but I need the suggestions in the dropdown box to be links.  anybody know of one already made?
[05:54:00] <BoulderDave> (autocomplete rather, not auto-suggestions)
[05:55:38] <stenno|work> NodeX, please show me a normal webserver where you can request arbitrary data cross-domain AJAX without any further configuration
[05:55:43] <stenno|work> without jsonp or something
[05:55:52] <NodeX> I dont have to show you anything
[05:55:54] <stenno|work> it doesn't exists
[05:55:56] <stenno|work> right
[05:55:58] <stenno|work> because you can't
[05:55:59] <NodeX> All I said was the title is misleading
[05:56:10] <stenno|work> w/e
[05:56:12] <NodeX> and again \n is not punctuation
[05:56:37] <NodeX> the title should say "WIthout preparation Cross-domain requests are not possible"
[05:56:39] <D4> xec|work ª you got any ideas? ;D
[05:57:21] <xec|work> unclemantis: there is a distinct lack of comments in your code - what part is working and what is not?
[05:57:30] <NodeX> instead it blindly makes out that they are not possible period
[05:57:32] <stenno|work> i don't think resposibilty is by the creator of the slide, because he is very precise in the rest of its slide
[05:57:41] <Trisox> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/fRnb6/1/
[05:57:43] <stenno|work> their*
[05:57:51] <andr0id1> ok, i have another question...i have form with 4 fields, and i want to verify dinamically if the values are correct. for example: email validation, check if the value is number etc. now, i dont quite seem to write the function to check them without page refresh, and if the value is correct or incorrect, under the field to appear div with the correspondent content. and if any of the values is
[05:57:52] <andr0id1> not correct, the form cannot be submitted. can you help me with that?
[05:58:00] <NodeX> yes the rest of the slide(s) are very good
[05:58:07] <NodeX> that title lets it down
[05:58:22] <unclemantis> xec|work focus
[05:58:25] <stenno|work> its true that the title is not correct
[05:58:51] <dawin> hi all
[05:58:54] <stenno|work> but i think its ok because on the same slide, he points out what he means with "Its not possible"
[05:59:07] <Trisox> EdwardIII: like that?
[05:59:08] <stenno|work> maybe there is a reason it is only in quotation marks
[05:59:15] <Flo0815> hey what's the best way to build php-like classes in javascript?
[05:59:36] <stenno|work> Flo0815, not doing it would be the first
[05:59:43] <stenno|work> javascript has no classes
[05:59:43] <Trisox> :D
[05:59:48] <Flo0815> i know, objects
[05:59:54] <stenno|work> also php classes sucks, as i heard
[05:59:57] <Flo0815> :D
[06:00:01] <Trisox> he means something like mvc
[06:00:02] <stenno|work> also, join #javascript :)
[06:00:04] <unclemantis> xec|work select works just fine btw
[06:00:05] <stenno|work> mvc?
[06:00:06] <EdwardIII> Trisox: that seemed to cause flashing, but this works ok: http://jsfiddle.net/fRnb6/2/
[06:00:10] <andr0id1> can anyone help me with my question?
[06:00:11] <stenno|work> on the server side then
[06:00:14] <Flo0815> model-view-controller
[06:00:15] <timing> but IF you have to, go for jquery-lowpro, but in the end you decide you never started with it
[06:00:22] <stenno|work> i know what mvc is
[06:00:25] <Trisox> ahk
[06:00:28] <stenno|work> i didn't know this was server side
[06:00:33] <stenno|work> so you are using node.js?
[06:00:57] <Trisox> i was talking to Flo0815
[06:01:11] <Flo0815> ok so lets call it objects, whats the best way to build them? are there different approaches?
[06:01:23] <andr0id1> oh come on, will anyone help me about my problem?
[06:01:29] <xec|work> unclemantis: i couldnt make sense of all the code so i removed some bits:P http://jsfiddle.net/NP8ea/1/
[06:01:43] <Trisox> ?paste andr0id1
[06:01:56] <andr0id1> i have form with 4 fields, and i want to verify dinamically if the values are correct. for example: email validation, check if the value is number etc. now, i dont quite seem to write the function to check them without page refresh, and if the value is correct or incorrect, under the field to appear div with the correspondent content. and if any of the values is not correct, the form cannot be
[06:01:56] <andr0id1> submitted. can you help me with that?
[06:02:06] <unclemantis> oh okj
[06:02:16] <unclemantis> this.value instead?
[06:02:30] <stenno|work> you can do mvc with node.js, Flo0815
[06:02:32] <Trisox> andr0id1: jquery validate ?
[06:02:47] <stenno|work> if you want server-side js
[06:02:50] <stenno|work> its awesome
[06:02:52] <Trisox> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[06:03:02] <xec|work> unclemantis: this.value is the same as $(this).attr("value")
[06:03:06] <Flo0815> server-side javascript? interessting
[06:03:31] <unclemantis> hmmm so wtf
[06:03:35] <stenno|work> how do php classes work?
[06:03:39] <NodeX> node is a little green
[06:03:40] <stenno|work> what do you expect from them
[06:03:52] <xec|work> unclemantis: and since i'm not too familiar with the autocomplete events i just put the focus listener on the same chain
[06:04:59] <Flo0815> other question, what does the __ mean in a variable declaration?
[06:05:00] <unclemantis> idk why your's works and mine doesn't
[06:05:04] <Flo0815> like var __test = ...
[06:05:07] <andr0id1> what about the div appearing under the field? can i do this: <input type="text" name ="field" onchange="checkfield(this.value)">
[06:05:22] <stenno|work> Flo0815, nothing really iirc
[06:05:23] <xec|work> D4: the buttons aren't fixed at all now?
[06:05:32] <stenno|work> Flo0815, anyway ask in #javascript :)
[06:05:34] <Trisox> onchange?
[06:05:40] <Flo0815> k
[06:05:44] <Flo0815> thx anyway
[06:05:46] <D4> xec|work ª No, absolute - if you change to fixed using the inspector you'll see what I mean :)
[06:05:47] <guy> xec|work: Care to look at your answer?
[06:05:53] <xec|work> Flo0815: it doesn't mean anything, it's probably just some convention
[06:06:07] <andr0id1> yes
[06:06:25] <Trisox> you dont need that with jquery validate...
[06:06:31] <Trisox> check the plugin
[06:06:45] <Trisox> http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/
[06:06:58] <unclemantis> may something is being lost in coffeescript translation
[06:06:58] <andr0id1> hmm...will look arround, and might find a solution
[06:07:14] <andr0id1> yesssss
[06:07:22] <Trisox> got nice functions like using number only
[06:07:25] <andr0id1> Trisox: that is what i needed :D
[06:07:29] <Trisox> length restriction min and max
[06:07:30] <Trisox> etc
[06:07:31] <cil> xec|work: now i get the same error ba is undefined.. http://jsfiddle.net/RAC3a/7/
[06:07:47] <Trisox> andr0id1: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[06:07:59] <unclemantis> xec|work possibility? Lost in coffeescript conversion?
[06:09:30] <andr0id1> thank you thank you thank you :D you saved me a lot of time :D
[06:10:27] <Trisox> np
[06:10:30] <andr0id1> Trisox, a beer for ya :)
[06:10:39] <Trisox> its 15:10 hehe
[06:10:49] <andr0id1> its 16:10 here :D

[06:11:16] <Trisox> haha :D
[06:11:27] <whitman> http://jsfiddle.net/RgFMM/ - Is there anyway to get an event when 'Yes' becomes unchecked, or do I have to listen for change on 'No' as well?
[06:13:22] * unclemantis bangs head against virtual wall
[06:13:52] <andr0id> its a very good thing that you help people
[06:16:46] <guy> Anyone can help me with this question?
[06:16:46] <guy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10498839/concatenating-jquery-objects/10499022
[06:20:15] <xec|work> guy: you're right, .add() might not work, writing a new answer now
[06:22:05] <cil> xec|work: now i get the same error ba is undefined.. http://jsfiddle.net/RAC3a/7/ thats seems to be my problem in the live version too ;)
[06:23:59] <xec|work> guy: updated SO
[06:24:38] <guy> xec|work: I knew of this way.
[06:25:09] <xec|work> ok....
[06:25:22] <xec|work> why wouldn't you just do it that way then
[06:25:53] <guy> which is disgusting.. anyway, I will confirm this as an answer and downgrade do string concatenation.
[06:26:10] <xec|work> "disgusting"?
[06:26:50] <guy> I am very "special". I don't like some logic patterns in my code.
[06:27:48] <stenno|work> wtf
[06:27:59] <stenno|work> how would you write code without logic?
[06:28:22] <andr0id> this one i dont know, i've seen it on a website, and i dont know how its done, so i just need help. in a form, the text field is inittialy empty. it is also clickable, now, when you click on it, a shadowbox appears allong with entries from a database from some column. there's the fields, and bellow that there's an text field, to add new value. when added, it is automatically added in the db
[06:28:22] <andr0id> without refresh. when you click on one field, the shadowbox closes, the values gets entered in the clickablle field without refresh. can anyone help me to replicate that?
[06:28:31] <Eviltwin> guy: var set = $(); for(...) { set = set.add($("<div>")...); } set.appendTo(".entries");
[06:29:04] <guy> Eviltwin: that, didn't work.
[06:29:15] <xec|work> i thought it should work that way too
[06:29:46] <guy> I am not sure myself why it doesn't work, but didn't want to waste hours experimenting.
[06:30:33] <Eviltwin> guy: http://jsfiddle.net/jp7X4/
[06:31:09] <guy> hm. wtf.
[06:31:24] <dawin> 1 question if you have a $.ajax get request, does the code after the request wait for the request or does it trigger asap?
[06:31:39] <stenno|work> triggers asap
[06:31:43] <Eviltwin> You're absolutely right to not want to do string concatenation
[06:31:43] <stenno|work> its async
[06:31:48] <dawin> is there a command for letting it wait?
[06:32:01] <dawin> instead of using success
[06:32:09] <stenno|work> no, not that i would know
[06:32:14] <dawin> kay thx
[06:32:14] <stenno|work> you can use async: false
[06:32:16] <xec|work> Eviltwin: i must be doing something silly, why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/Eb4Ej/
[06:32:34] <dawin> wich means the next code just waits?
[06:32:53] <guy> I know why your doesn't work, but I don't get it why my doesn't work.
[06:32:56] <Eviltwin> xec|work: Look at the difference between yours and mine when adding elements
[06:33:20] <stenno|work> dawin, not really :/
[06:33:29] <stenno|work> dawin, you have to use success and events
[06:33:32] <guy> var entry	= entry_set.add(entry);
[06:33:36] <guy> uh. idiot.
[06:33:38] <dawin> ok thx
[06:33:46] <guy> Thank you Eviltwin.
[06:33:47] <dawin> i guess i define just a function
[06:33:53] <dawin> and on success it triggers :)
[06:34:05] <stenno|work> yup
[06:34:09] <xec|work> Eviltwin: i must be blind, all the difference i can see is syntax
[06:34:14] <guy> Well, goodbye string concatenation.
[06:35:45] <xec|work> Eviltwin: ah jeeez
[06:35:49] <xec|work> Eviltwin: i see it
[06:35:58] <xec|work> Eviltwin: and i'm gonna go back to sleep now
[06:36:21] <cybuch> Hello, anyone have got idea how to make http://ajks.pl/projekt/index.html the little red box to show values from 0 to x?
[06:37:42] <danzik17> guy: you might want to profile that method versus using an actual templating language like mustache, i'm betting itll will be much faster.
[06:37:54] <NodeX> $('#pierdolnik').text( Math.abs(parseInt(dx)) );
[06:38:11] <stenno|work> mustaaache :{
[06:38:16] <guy> wut?
[06:39:18] <guy> Why on Earth would you think that mustache be faster, danzik17?
[06:39:35] <cybuch> NodeX: Well it's not exactly what I meant. Maybe I didn't say it clear, but what function shall I use instead of Math.abs(...) to have the range of numbers from 0 to x?
[06:39:45] <cybuch> it's supposed to work like a knob you know
[06:40:01] <NodeX> floor / ceil ?
[06:40:01] <danzik17> guy: why on earth would you think creating N dom elements would be faster rather than having a templating library abstract the string concatenation away from you?
[06:40:06] <Eviltwin> danzik17: Pretty sure it requires a lot more parsing work with mustache
[06:40:13] <NodeX> or ask in #javascript
[06:40:22] <Eviltwin> danzik17: Abstraction pretty much always means slower
[06:40:35] <NodeX> why do people even use templating engines
[06:40:40] <NodeX> do they like slow apps ?
[06:40:42] <cybuch> NodeX: thanks, will try floor/ceil functions
[06:40:44] <EdwardIII> not using one would be a pain with something like backbone.js
[06:41:04] <NodeX> Cybertinus or round()
[06:41:30] <guy> Eviltwin: Are you saying that mustahce would actually work faster?
[06:41:41] <guy> mustache*
[06:41:46] <shoky> that's not what he said at all
[06:42:10] <guy> shoky: Just double checking if my English is not failing.
[06:47:45] <danzik17> guy: Eviltwin:  http://jsperf.com/templating-vs-jquery
[06:53:00] <shoky> xec i thought you were sleeping ;P
[06:53:22] <shoky> and uhm. at work?
[06:53:23] <xec|work> isn't this a dream?
[06:53:28] <shoky> ;P
[06:53:34] <dawin> can you set a handler wich listens on window changes?
[06:53:48] <dawin> like change of height width scrolltop
[06:53:49] <xec|work> shoky: yep, thats right. i irc a lot at work :D
[06:54:22] <xec|work> but seeing as my client at home is still connected my normal nick is in use
[06:54:37] <shoky> irc, for sure
[06:54:39] <shoky> but sleep? :)
[06:55:20] <xec|work> irc is verb right? as is sleepworkircing?
[06:55:26] <shoky> dawin: the window has scroll and resize events
[06:55:29] <dawin> atm i have alot functions wich check the height, width of $(window) isnt it better to just check it once and adjust the values on change of $(window) or is it safe to check it 100 times? :D
[06:55:39] <shoky> o i c
[06:55:43] <stenno|work> IRCing
[06:56:07] <xec|work> stenno|work: to irc or not to irc
[06:56:21] <dawin> this is the question :D
[06:57:36] <bobbytek> Howdy
[06:58:01] <bobbytek> What's a nice tool tip plugin that is lightweight and easy to use?
[06:58:28] <shoky> last one i remember is tipsy
[06:58:34] <smykes> bobbytek the twitter bootstrap one isnt bad
[06:58:37] <smykes> which is tipsy
[06:58:39] <xec|work> bobbytek: .show() to display the tooltip and .hide() to hide it
[06:58:43] <bobbytek> I've used tiptip
[06:58:52] <bobbytek> I'll take a look
[06:58:54] <bobbytek> thanks guys
[07:00:03] <smykes> I am on record as saying using the asp reporting tool is a bad idea!
[07:00:34] <bobbytek> smykes, does this work on elements other than anchor?
[07:00:42] <xec|work> asp? is that some sort of snake? or tree?
[07:00:43] <myel> does someone know if its possible to detect 301 redirects with jQuery.ajax()? it seems it just follows the redirect and gives 200 as the status code (which is probably not the worst thing to do)...
[07:01:17] <smykes> bobbytek yes
[07:01:26] <smykes> bobbytek i have used it on table cells
[07:01:40] <smykes> xec|work asp.net
[07:01:52] <smykes> and they are going to come to me and tell me to make it look native
[07:01:54] <xec|work> smykes: yeah i was just pulling your leg ;)
[07:02:07] <smykes> and im going to say, yeah that's impossible, i told you not to do it that way
[07:02:10] <stenno|work> asp.net webforms?
[07:02:13] <stenno|work> or mvc?
[07:02:18] <xec|work> smykes: as a css guy, i feel for you
[07:02:24] <smykes> webforms
[07:02:28] <stenno|work> ouch :(
[07:02:35] <smykes> xec|work these tables have dynamic classes and no ids
[07:02:50] <stenno|work> maybe we should invite reverseblade here, xec|work :)
[07:02:55] <xec|work> hehe yeah
[07:03:10] <stenno|work> but reverseblade is great
[07:03:21] <smykes> I told them im not going to take the blame when the bosses complain it looks like shit
[07:03:24] <stenno|work> he shows the best aspects and really knows a lot of lot of stuff
[07:03:38] <xec|work> i really do feel your pain, my job is essentially front-end for webforms stuff
[07:03:51] <stenno|work> wow
[07:03:59] <xec|work> and front-end is sort of obscured/abstracted away -.-
[07:04:13] <xec|work> from a webforms point of view
[07:04:18] <stenno|work> yeah you have frontend and backend at the same time
[07:04:23] <smykes> xec|work mine too!
[07:04:26] <stenno|work> don't make css based on IDs :D
[07:04:34] <stenno|work> always use classes...
[07:04:38] <smykes> xec|work but we are moving to js
[07:04:47] <xec|work> there are so many pitfalls and caveats
[07:04:52] <smykes> stenno|work I know, but if I had to I could since the classes are dynamic
[07:05:05] <xec|work> and css generated  by dll files?! whose idea was that
[07:05:15] <xec|work> </rant>
[07:05:22] <smykes> it is the worst code ever
[07:05:26] <bobbytek> Okay, trying to download tipsy... but can't find the download link! http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/node/12257
[07:05:26] <smykes> tables inside tables
[07:05:29] <bobbytek> wtf?
[07:05:37] <smykes> bobbytek hold on
[07:05:47] <smykes> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popover
[07:06:14] <m0dmd> hmmm instead of browser user-agent check, why not screen size check
[07:06:25] <bobbytek> smykes, that for me?
[07:06:26] <smykes> xec|work do you have to support IE 7 also?
[07:06:54] <xec|work> smykes: for external stuff, yes
[07:07:14] <smykes> xec|work we work with healthcare exclusively, fucking ancient browsers
[07:07:45] <xec|work> smykes: fortunately i'm mostly on intranet style apps, so i can ignore anything older than ie8 (soon to be ie9 and older)
[07:08:01] <smykes> xec|work I envy you sir
[07:08:06] <xec|work> and i just can't wait for the day ie9 dies
[07:08:10] <xec|work> :P
[07:08:15] <m0dmd> rofl
[07:08:17] <marcoscerutti> Hello guys. newbie here. I need to append an button with an id or class. how to do it in the best form?
[07:08:30] <smykes> IE 9 is at least not as terrible as 8
[07:08:42] <marcoscerutti> Im trying this $("#f").append("<button id="btn">Consultar</button>");
[07:08:55] <shoky> escape your inner quotes
[07:09:05] <shoky> or make them single
[07:09:07] <smykes> good eye shoky
[07:09:09] <marcoscerutti> shoky: thanks mate. will try it
[07:09:23] <xec|work> smykes: yeah it's a step in the right general direction, but a lot of ancient API is kept and way too little of the standards have made it through
[07:09:35] * shoky eyes smykes
[07:09:47] <smykes> xec|work at least there is canvas support
[07:10:02] <marcoscerutti> shoky: thanks man!!!!
[07:10:12] <shoky> N_P
[07:10:21] <xec|work> smykes: about bloody time, too ;D
[07:10:51] <smykes> ever tried to make asp.net charts look pretty?
[07:11:30] <stenno|work> charts?
[07:11:33] <xec|work> smykes: one of the main issues with IE is the support time by MS - if they just made IE9+ able to install on XP etc and only ever support the latest version the future would be brighter
[07:11:36] <stenno|work> as in asp:chart?
[07:11:54] <stenno|work> they _are_ highly customizable
[07:11:55] <smykes> stenno|work yes all of that junk
[07:12:01] <stenno|work> you need a bit of time
[07:12:09] <smykes> xec|work updates take forever in healthcare
[07:12:12] <stenno|work> anyway, you can code vanilla html/js on the aspx ofc
[07:12:15] <m0dmd> marcoscerutti: http://jsfiddle.net/7NBe9/
[07:12:19] <smykes> stenno|work to make them look pretty?
[07:12:31] <smykes> i didn't knowo you could do that
[07:12:31] <stenno|work> smykes, well not the charts themselves
[07:12:39] <stenno|work> these are just rendered images...
[07:12:53] <xec|work> smykes: yeah but likely not if there was more incentive to upgrade
[07:12:55] <smykes> yes stenno|work why I would rather use canvas
[07:13:09] <marcoscerutti> m0dmd: oooohhh man!!!! this seems to be so precious! own you a cold one brother!
[07:13:09] <stenno|work> smykes, just do it then :)
[07:13:18] <stenno|work> smykes, you can even do it with css alone...
[07:13:20] <smykes> xec|work i stopped supporting old versions of FF
[07:13:28] <m0dmd> marcoscerutti: yw buddy
[07:13:53] <m0dmd> god is good, and jQuery is god
[07:14:03] <smykes> stenno|work I have so little interest in learning old technology
[07:14:12] <smykes> stenno|work it looks so good on resumes!
[07:14:17] <xec|work> smykes: yeah same here, and old chrome/safari are pretty much non-existant because the new versions get pushed out much more effectively than ie
[07:14:41] <shoky> a nudge would have been enough
[07:15:06] <stenno|work> smykes, then have your fun with canvas :) for static things you might even use it
[07:15:19] <stenno|work> getting it interactive could be a little bit more complicated though ...
[07:15:23] <smykes> xec|work im not supporting chrome, to many small diferences, I can't be arsed to support 12 browsers
[07:15:35] <smykes> too
[07:15:54] <smykes> and the issue is IE 8 on Windows 7 renders diferently then IE 8 in XP
[07:15:57] <xec|work> smykes: well that's just it, i only care about current chrome
[07:16:08] <shoky> people use IE8 on win7?
[07:16:17] <smykes> stenno|work yeah I have just started working with canvas a bit
[07:16:19] <DeltaHeavy> I'm trying to expan a div with another div in it with a static height and a bunch of content in it. How can I have it so when the button is clicked it slides the menu into view and when it's clicked again it slides into height:0 and it can be unseen: http://jsfiddle.net/FDvb3/
[07:16:25] <xec|work> shoky: ie8 is shipped with w7
[07:16:29] <smykes> shoky oh you would be amazed
[07:16:33] <stenno|work> smykes, its really not that difficult, even a bit fun
[07:16:37] <shoky> hmm really. forgot about that
[07:16:41] <xec|work> and people just don't upgrade
[07:17:14] <shoky> im still on XP on my work PC :((
[07:17:31] <xec|work> ouch
[07:17:41] <smykes> im running 7 in a virtual machine
[07:17:46] <m0dmd> DeltaHeavy: have you looked into show/hide?
[07:17:46] <johnkpaul> shoky: do you not sleep :)
[07:17:54] <xec|work> ha, i have w7 as vm too
[07:17:58] <shoky> i sleep tons. i just dont work :\
[07:18:07] <johnkpaul> hahaha
[07:18:09] <smykes> xec|work I had to FIGHT for more ram
[07:18:20] <DeltaHeavy> Just got a fix from another channel. Forgot to set overflow to hidden
[07:18:28] <m0dmd> DeltaHeavy: or slideToggle
[07:18:29] <smykes> finally got it as they were replacing everyone elses workstations
[07:18:31] <shoky> thats the suckage about being able to work on my own schedule
[07:18:37] <shoky> i just stay home ;D
[07:18:47] <shoky> and irc and sleep.
[07:18:55] <xec|work> smykes: "everyone elses"? ouch again
[07:18:56] <m0dmd> shoky: rofl
[07:19:15] <smykes> xec|work I'm on a mac, they are all on PCs
[07:19:40] <xec|work> oh, you're a hipster! like me!
[07:19:53] <smykes> i was using macs before it was cool
[07:19:57] <johnkpaul> us front enders can always get away with hipsterness like that
[07:20:00] <xec|work> rofl
[07:20:01] <captbrogers> I believe I am a bigger hipster. I'm using Linux and it isn't cool
[07:20:03] <johnkpaul> how else can we have bash next to photoshop
[07:20:15] <smykes> pshaw photoshop
[07:20:21] <smykes> i do all my graphics in inkscake
[07:20:30] <smykes> inkscape and that's the way I like it
[07:20:46] <stenno|work> inkscape is vector program
[07:20:51] <stenno|work> photoshop is pixel...
[07:20:52] <smykes> yes it is
[07:20:53] <xec|work> i use inkscape a bit on windows at home, but i just dont like it in X11
[07:20:56] <stenno|work> they are different things
[07:21:01] <stenno|work> to do different tasks
[07:21:01] <smykes> if i need to cut things up i us gimp
[07:21:04] <m0dmd> lol
[07:21:13] <saba> It's a good practice to invoke .on() outside of document ready, right? Or what would be a good reason to use it within document ready?
[07:21:16] <smykes>  ive been using inkscape for close to 10 years
[07:21:19] <xec|work> X11 always feels... wrong... somehow
[07:21:28] <stenno|work> xec|work :D
[07:21:52] <lduros> hello, is it possible to do a fadeIn fadeOut using visibility:hidden/visible rather than display:none or rather using animate with opacity from 0 to 1? I have issues with opacity in IE8, and I need to get the dimensions of an image so display:none won't work -- thanks
[07:21:58] <shoky> so.. anyone maybe know how to get OSX running with xcode on virtualbox on win7?
[07:22:11] <johnkpaul> shoky: that is illegal
[07:22:14] <johnkpaul> :)
[07:22:23] <smykes> shoky lol xcode barely runs natively anymore
[07:22:30] <johnkpaul> saba: what do you mean? you are free to use .on() anywhere
[07:22:32] <shoky> well
[07:22:42] <stenno|work> is there not hackintosh?
[07:22:46] <shoky> i just wanna get into iOS dev
[07:22:49] <stenno|work> it was full of fail though
[07:22:51] <shoky> and i really dont wanna get a mac
[07:22:55] <shoky> i hackintoshed it
[07:22:58] <smykes> shoky then use rails or phone gap
[07:23:01] <shoky> i got OSX snow leopard running fine
[07:23:02] <stenno|work> rails?
[07:23:09] <shoky> but xcode fails to install
[07:23:09] <stenno|work> phone gap is awesome
[07:23:34] <smykes> I meant ruby
[07:23:34] <smykes> applications
[07:23:36] <stenno|work> jquery mobile is also your friend ofc :)
[07:23:40] <saba> johnkpaul: I've started to use .on() as a replacement of .live(). I'm free to use it everywhere, but it would be better to invoke it outside of document ready since I don't have to wait for ready to be invoked. That's my thought.
[07:23:41] <smykes> http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/05/exclusive-building-ruby-ios-applications-with-rubymotion.ars
[07:23:46] <shoky> so i can make native iOS apps with it?
[07:23:49] <stenno|work> smykes, ruby apps don't run nativly in ios devices
[07:24:07] <xec|work> saba: that depends on what you call .on() on
[07:24:08] <shoky> native iOS apps that have access to native iOS API ?
[07:24:09] <stenno|work> Obj-C is the way to go :(
[07:24:26] <shoky> with phone gap, i mean
[07:24:35] <shoky> i dont mind Obj-C
[07:24:45] <shoky> i just need a working dev environment
[07:24:45] <johnkpaul> saba: if you don't mind that all of your events are going to need to propagate all the way to the document, then sure
[07:24:49] <johnkpaul> there are pros and cons, shoky
[07:25:04] <johnkpaul> saba: read the pros and cons list of .live() here - http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[07:25:19] <stenno|work> i remember dummy iOS environments
[07:25:26] <smykes> shoky http://phonegap.com/about/features
[07:25:31] <stenno|work> but really, i just would program html
[07:25:44] <saba> johnkpaul: I'm familiar with .live() already and a good technique to meet those cons of .live() is to invoke it -outside- of document ready.
[07:25:47] <stenno|work> (no direct access to the hardware then though)
[07:25:59] <saba> I wonder if it's the same with .on() or if there's any reason to invoke that inside.
[07:26:09] <shoky> compass = twisting and turning sensors?
[07:26:13] <saba> xec|work: why?
[07:26:17] <xec|work> saba: are you familiar with delegates?
[07:26:21] <stenno|work> you don't have direct access to the hardware, not even direct access to your fucking file system on a fucking ipod
[07:26:28] <johnkpaul> saba: what is the con of live that requires you to use it outside of document.ready? there is no such restriction
[07:26:34] <stenno|work> it is beyond my understanding why people would buy this kind of crap
[07:26:43] <saba> xec|work: no, I'm jumping straight from .live() to .on(), I did miss the delegate period I believe
[07:26:44] <stenno|work> iphone, that is
[07:26:46] <johnkpaul> .live() _can_ be used outside of document.ready, it doesn't mean that it has to be used outside of document.ready
[07:27:04] <dawin> whats the version of jslint in jsfiddle?
[07:27:12] <xec|work> saba: you need to attach .on() to something, an ancestor of what you want to bind to
[07:27:27] <saba> johnkpaul: I've never said it has to be outside. The good thing with using .live() outside is that the selector is "useless"
[07:27:29] <xec|work> saba: .live() always attaches to document root
[07:27:41] <johnkpaul> saba: that good thing does have some cons though
[07:27:49] <johnkpaul> you have to weigh those cons in your use case
[07:27:55] <saba> xec|work: I'm doing $(document).on('click', '#foo', function ()..)
[07:28:07] <dawin> is there a good jq analyzer?
[07:28:19] <johnkpaul> saba: why are you doing that instead of adding the handler directly? there can only be one #foo in your document
[07:28:20] <saba> johnkpaul: I agree. Let's talk about .on()
[07:28:32] <johnkpaul> your usage of .on() is exactly the same as .live, saba
[07:28:37] <xec|work> saba: ok, that's the same as the .live(), and could potentially be intercepted
[07:28:50] <saba> johnkpaul: however .live() is deprecated
[07:28:55] <johnkpaul> dawin: analyzer?
[07:29:03] <johnkpaul> saba: yes, because you can achieve all of the same functionality using .on directly
[07:29:09] <johnkpaul> .live is just a small wrapper around .on
[07:29:19] <johnkpaul> saba: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.live
[07:29:26] <saba> johnkpaul: aha, it's a wrapper nowadays? I did not know that.
[07:29:36] <johnkpaul> yeah ,it's a one liner
[07:29:36] <dawin> johnkpaul yes, code quality analyzer
[07:29:54] <johnkpaul> dawin: there are js linters, like jshint or jslint, nothing jquery specific AFIAK
[07:29:58] <xec|work> saba: lets say you return false from another .live() binding (same event), the others will be stopped. using .on() on a closer ancestor could potentially fix that
[07:30:21] <shoky> hmm with phonegap i must upload my app to their builder thingy ?
[07:30:32] <xec|work> saba: but then you need to bind after the dom is ready just like with any other selector
[07:30:51] <ready> lala
[07:30:56] <dawin> yes i saw jshint but it trows alot jquery specific errors
[07:31:07] <johnkpaul> dawin: jquery specific errors like what?
[07:31:15] <stenno|work> is jquery jslint-happy?
[07:31:25] <dawin> $.cID = (function() { : Missing "use strict" statement.
[07:31:37] <saba> let me rephrase my question: I'm removing my usage of .live() since it's deprecated. I'm now using .on() for the exactly same thing. What I'm wondering about is the difference of invoking .on() inside and outside respectively of document ready. What's best practice? What are the pros and cons?
[07:32:02] <johnkpaul> dawin: that's not jquery itself, and you can configure jshint to your liking
[07:32:02] <xec|work> dawin:  that's not jquery specific, and if you're not coding for ES5 you can disable that warning
[07:32:17] <johnkpaul> :) we are one mind
[07:32:25] <dawin> i see
[07:32:26] * xec|work highfives johnkpaul
[07:32:34] <dawin> there is even a jquery check
[07:32:36] <dawin> i did miss that
[07:32:37] <smykes> why do you need 10.7 to download xcode now
[07:32:39] <dawin> nice
[07:33:24] <johnkpaul> saba: it depends on how you use .on(), I have never really found a reason to go through the extreme optimization of adding .live() like handlers before document.ready
[07:33:28] <johnkpaul> but I'm sure a use case exists
[07:33:41] <dawin> xec so i can just "When code is not in strict mode" disable this check?
[07:33:52] <johnkpaul> I think that the best practice is to set up event handlers after document.ready, but I could be convinced that there are reasons not to do that
[07:34:14] <johnkpaul> dawin: http://www.jshint.com/options/
[07:34:19] <johnkpaul> es5:false
[07:35:25] <shoky> phonegap = browser baseD?
[07:35:36] <johnkpaul> shoky: yes, phonegap is an application built around the uiwebview
[07:35:37] <saba> johnkpaul: when it's "live" event handlers and when some parts of the page are loaded seconds before others, those handlers can be used earlier than the .ready() is invoked since .ready() is invoked when the entire page is "ready".
[07:35:40] <smykes> shoky nope
[07:35:40] <xec|work> dawin: there is a (sometimes good) reason behind most warnings from jslint, if you don't know what "strict mode" is i suggest you read up on it, and decide if you want to use it or not, and if you decide not to, you can disable the warning
[07:35:42] <johnkpaul> but you can make javascript calls to native functionality
[07:36:00] <shoky> when my app is running, its in a browseR?
[07:36:02] <smykes> but johnkpaul it's native though
[07:36:07] <johnkpaul> saba: they can't be used earlier than .ready, bceause the elemnts aren't there
[07:36:19] <johnkpaul> saba: yes, it is a native app, but the functionality works through a browser inside the native app
[07:36:41] <saba> johnkpaul: they can if some of the elements are there, before ready()
[07:37:18] <dawin> yes thanks
[07:37:21] <saba> they're not there at the invoke of .on(), however they are there before .ready() (in between of .ready() and .on() call)
[07:37:44] <dawin> how do you disable advanced options in jshint online?
[07:37:57] <xec|work> hrm, is it a bad sign when my coca-cola tastes slightly like paint?
[07:38:08] <dawin> it hats few options defined to disabled but i cant declare somewhere, for like es5:false
[07:38:08] <johnkpaul> saba: I don't think tha tyou should write your code expecting dom elements to be available _before_ domready
[07:38:18] <johnkpaul> that is definitely an antipattern
[07:38:22] <johnkpaul> whether or not it might be true
[07:38:48] <saba> johnkpaul: it's only a case of an advantage *if* the elements are there. If they're not, no harm is done.
[07:39:02] <johnkpaul> dawin: ther'es a comment syntax that alows you to set them,but I don't know how it works, and I don't know if the online version works with them
[07:39:12] <saba> however a harm is done if they're there before ready() but without handlers, which might happen.
[07:39:23] <johnkpaul> saba: no harm is done, sure, but it is going to be confusing to read your code, IMHO
[07:39:25] <saba> it depends on how the page are structured etc.
[07:40:01] <saba> johnkpaul: depends, it's really not that confusing since nothing requires elements to exist before document ready
[07:40:06] <xec|work> saba: if you have them inside docready, it will be easier to optimize them later
[07:40:15] <johnkpaul> you're correct that it does not _require_ them to be there
[07:40:22] <xec|work> saba: because binding to document isn't really a brilliant idea
[07:40:57] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile iScrollview, Version 1.1+ - nice iscroll plugin - https://t.co/UZrWpLr9 ‚òÖ http://bit.ly/JbzCdG
[07:41:02] <xec|work> saba: so when you figure out what the closest permanent ancestor is, you can bind to that instead
[07:41:17] <Ankabout> I have a function that hides/shows some elements, and reads a #hash from the URL. works perfectly in all browsers, except IE7
[07:41:17] <saba> xec|work: I might not fully understand .on() yet. Can you explain the difference in $(document).on('click', '.foo', ..) and $('.foo').on('click', '.foo', ..); ?
[07:41:19] <dawin> johnkpaul: i got it, it works with /* options */
[07:41:31] <Ankabout> there it scrolls to the bottom of the page when it's done loading and everything
[07:41:38] <xec|work> saba: if i'm confusing you, you should read the part about delegates in the .on() documentation
[07:41:48] <johnkpaul> saba: did you read that post from elijah manor?
[07:41:50] <saba> xec|work: am I understanding you correctly, if you're suggesting the last example?
[07:41:54] <johnkpaul> it explains fairly thoroughly
[07:42:05] <marcoscerutti> I got lost here, seems I can't trigger my action. would you guys gimme a little help here and tell me whats wrong?
[07:42:06] <marcoscerutti> http://jsfiddle.net/7NBe9/
[07:42:06] <xec|work> saba: essentially you would do something like $("#permanentContainer").on("click", ".foo", func)
[07:42:09] <shoky> Requirements: Intel-based computer with Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6)
[07:42:33] <xec|work> saba: binding to .foo and then filtering on .foo does not make sense
[07:42:35] <shoky> Download and install Xcode from Apple Developer Portal (Membership required)
[07:42:37] <saba> xec|work: Aha, I see!
[07:42:37] <shoky> awesome
[07:42:39] <johnkpaul> marcoscerutti: http://jsfiddle.net/7NBe9/1/
[07:42:54] <johnkpaul> shoky: you need lion to get the new xdode
[07:43:01] <johnkpaul> if that's what you're trying to do
[07:43:05] <saba> xec|work: I missed that the selector of .on() is a filter. I agree with you then, using document is a really bad idea.
[07:43:19] <shoky> jkp i thought phonegap meant i dont need it..
[07:43:34] <johnkpaul> shoky: phonegap means you don't need it to build the majority of your app
[07:43:38] <johnkpaul> but you need it to actually finish it
[07:43:40] <dns-away> hello, how i can remove empty lines from a string ?
[07:43:43] <shoky> oh
[07:43:51] <johnkpaul> well, also, if you want to test on mobile safari you'll need the ios simulator
[07:44:01] <xec|work> saba: that's the main reason .live() is deprecated, because it looks like a selector when it's really more like a filter, so the syntax makes it confusing to understand what it really does
[07:44:11] <shoky> that doesnt help me then.. if i had xcode i'd just do real-native app
[07:44:17] <saba> xec|work: however $(document).on('click', '#foo', ..) might not be a bad idea?
[07:44:20] <johnkpaul> shoky: but you have to pay $99 for that
[07:44:22] <marcoscerutti> johnkpaul: sorry mate, I didn't get it :/
[07:44:25] <marcoscerutti> :(
[07:44:32] <johnkpaul> marcoscerutti: you are setting the attribute, not the property
[07:44:38] <johnkpaul> and then you lookup the property
[07:44:39] <shoky> hmpf
[07:44:46] <stenno|work> dns-away, regexp :)
[07:44:49] <xec|work> saba: well, it will work exactly the same as if you did a .live()
[07:44:50] <saba> xec|work: .. because of #foo instead of .foo I mean.
[07:45:15] <stenno|work> with empty lines, do you mean "blabla\n\nfoo" ?
[07:45:16] <dns-away> stenno|work, can you show example ? :-)
[07:45:23] <shoky> hell i'd pay $99 if i could easily develop on windows
[07:45:25] <xec|work> saba: if you just want to listen to one ID you would just do $("#id").on("click", func)
[07:45:27] <johnkpaul> saba: in my opinion, the cons of live/on-like-live are only outweighed by a use case that requires dynamic insertion of new elements
[07:45:40] <mertin> hi all. I'm using jquery for the first time these days... I'm  trying to set a cookie, using jquery.cookie.js
[07:45:49] <mertin> is it possilbe to set a cookie to a boolean value?
[07:46:33] <mertin> would it be "$.cookie("name", true)
[07:46:40] <xec|work> saba: however, if this ID might get overwritten by some ajax call replacing content or similar, you need to find an ancestor that will not be overwritten and bind to that with $("#ancestorElement").on("click", "#foo", func)
[07:46:41] <mertin> without the quotes
[07:46:49] <kavelot> when I iterate (for v in data) over a "data" result from $.post() as JSON, I get the indexes of the elements of the data array, but also object elements (clone, inArray, checkIndex...). Any ideas on what I'm doing wrongly?
[07:46:52] <mertin> or is it not possible
[07:47:03] <xec|work> sabe: which is how delegates work
[07:47:15] <johnkpaul> ?g hasOwnProperty mdn @ kavelot
[07:47:16] <bot-t> kavelot, hasOwnProperty - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/HasOwnProperty
[07:47:34] <johnkpaul> mertin: that should work, but true will be conveted into the string "true"
[07:47:37] <_kip> Has somebody an idea how I can bind a click event to a SVG image that's embedded in the page using the object-tag?
[07:47:38] <saba> xec|work: thus, your first example with only #id, click and func will behave as .bind() more or less. And when having an ancestor, it'll a "live" behaviour?
[07:47:49] <xec|work> saba: exactly
[07:48:02] <kavelot> johnkpaul: can't I iterate just over the values (like "console.log(data)" shows)?
[07:48:13] <saba> ah! I didn't understand .on() but now I see the difference.
[07:48:23] <saba> thanks xec|work and johnkpaul for your input :-)
[07:48:28] <xec|work> saba: .on() used in different ways replaces .bind() and .live() and .delegate()
[07:48:29] <marcoscerutti> johnkpaul: the button is created, and an id attached to it, and on the click, I call the getEndereco function. what step I messed up buddy?
[07:48:31] <johnkpaul> no problem, saba
[07:48:33] <shoky> ?$.each @ kavelot
[07:48:34] <bot-t> kavelot, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[07:48:37] <Sazpaimon> .bind('click', function(e){}) always, has an e.which, correct?
[07:48:38] <shoky> gr
[07:48:57] <johnkpaul> marcoscerutti: do you see the difference between what I sent you and what you made originally?
[07:49:09] <mertin> johnkpaul: so I'm supposed to work with strings only?
[07:49:22] <mertin> johnkpaul: it surprises me that boolean is not allowed
[07:49:46] <johnkpaul> mertin: cookies are name value pairs of strings
[07:49:52] <johnkpaul> by definition
[07:49:56] <mertin> right
[07:49:58] <mertin> true
[07:49:59] <johnkpaul> ?g set-cookie header http @ mertin
[07:50:00] <bot-t> mertin, HTTP cookie - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie
[07:50:21] <johnkpaul> mertin: you can save JSON into the cookie if you really want
[07:50:24] <johnkpaul> but consider using localstorage
[07:50:43] <mertin> johnkpaul: my question would be: if I retrieve a "true" string and assign it to a variable, could I treat that variable as a boolean?
[07:50:53] <stenno|work> dnstbr, are you dns-away? :)
[07:51:03] <stenno|work> sorry for highlight if not
[07:51:22] <smykes> i think its a string still mertin
[07:51:23] <dnstbr> stenno|work: I don't know what you mean lol.
[07:51:56] <stenno|work> dnstbr, sorry, somebody named 'dns-away' just asked a question, i had a solution and now he is gone :)
[07:52:03] <mertin> as you guys can see my general javascript is rusty :)
[07:52:07] <dnstbr> stenno|work: Ah ok. I hear ya.
[07:52:09] <johnkpaul> mertin: yes, you could, just compare tith the value "true"
[07:52:13] <stenno|work> and you joined just after he left
[07:52:20] <johnkpaul> with*
[07:52:44] <mertin> johnkpaul: yes, I was expecting a more dynamic behaviour like just saying
[07:52:52] <stenno|work> mystring.replace(/\n(?=\n)/, "")  removes empty lines
[07:52:52] <mertin> if varname then.....
[07:53:12] <johnkpaul> mertin: use JSON if you want some of the functionality OOTB
[07:53:16] <stenno|work> that is vanilla js btw
[07:53:23] <stenno|work> maybe there is a better solution in jquery
[07:53:40] <mertin> I've heard of JSON but not familiar with it
[07:53:44] <mertin> might take a look at it

[07:56:42] <marcoscerutti> johnkpaul: no man, Im not able to understand it :(
[07:57:07] <marcoscerutti> johnkpaul:  Im trying to, but my skills are too low
[07:58:44] <Xotix> ah finally got it
[07:58:48] <shoky> Xotix: you need a targetOrigin argument
[07:59:35] <johnkpaul> marcoscerutti: do you see a difference, whether or not you understand it?
[07:59:39] <johnkpaul> I changed .attr() to .prop()
[07:59:44] <Xotix> shoky yes, just saw it.
[07:59:56] <johnkpaul> in your original code, you were change the attribute, and then, in the next line, cecking the property

[08:10:19] <smykes> replace the whole page?

[08:11:31] <DelTree> yes... like if I clicked on a <a href>...
[08:11:45] <dawin> hmm lint makes me crazy xD var event = $.Event('click'); and in a if statement i use target2.trigger(event); he still says event is unused <.<?
[08:12:28] <DelTree> in fact I'm trying to make a button without a <form>... but maybe that's a bad idea to start with...

[08:15:06] <silverwind> DelTree, just use an anchor?
[08:15:36] <DelTree> silverwind: in fact it's a button...
[08:16:34] <silverwind> And?
[08:16:43] <silverwind> An anchor is a button too.
[08:16:55] <DelTree> ?
[08:17:31] <DelTree> I've never seen an anchor look anywhere close of a button...

[08:51:14] <LondonGuy> For some reason "change" is ignoring the fact that i've bound an element.. So after I make selection of a file things don't work as normal

[09:03:55] <Whirl3d> Is there a reason why a div (wrapped in jquery) would not have access to .on? I have a div with id="profile" which I format several child element in (so I know it's a valid jquery object) and yet when I try to assign on .on handler to it, it says object.object has not method on....weird.
[09:05:01] <ajpiano> wrong jquery version?
[09:05:21] <Whirl3d> maybe...I'll check. Great answer!

[09:10:55] <aitiba> hi
[09:11:16] <aitiba> some here has ever used full calendar jquery plugin? arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[09:11:23] <Whirl3d> hi altiba.
[09:12:01] <aitiba> I would like to make a new view but I'm a little bit confused about that
[09:12:09] <Whirl3d> I am afraid that I have never seen /used that plugin before.
[09:12:33] <ndimatteo> hey all, I'm using paul irish's infinite scroll, and I'm trying to get the manual behavior to work. Seems as though when I implement the manual behavior snippet, it works but the nextSelector doesn't get removed and reminded to the new one pulled in. Any ideas?
[09:12:46] <johnkpaul> aitiba: did you look at the examples
[09:12:47] <ndimatteo> rebinded*
[09:12:54] <johnkpaul> aitiba: to create a new month view http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/views/month/
[09:13:10] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ ndimatteo
[09:13:11] <bot-t> ndimatteo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:13:25] <ndimatteo> give me a second
[09:13:35] <nascro> Anyone familiar with using both hover and click methods to produce similar results?
[09:13:55] <aitiba> johnkpaul, the views taht are on this exampel are the default ones
[09:14:18] <aitiba> I would like to create new one as http://tux.fi/~jarnok/fullcalendar/demos/resourceView.html
[09:14:32] <aitiba> but this example gime an error on my localhost
[09:14:51] <johnkpaul> what is the error aitiba?
[09:15:01] <johnkpaul> nascro: you can add the same handler
[09:15:13] <johnkpaul> nascro: $().click(handler).hover(handler)
[09:15:58] <aitiba> Ja[k] is not a constructor it occures with defaultView: 'resourceDay',
[09:16:02] <nascro> @johnkpaul I seem to be doing something right, but something wrong. See: http://nathanroberts.com/clients/maloof/team.php and hover over multiple photos, you'll see my issue exposed.
[09:16:25] <aitiba> If I commented it the script runs but I cant see botton on the righr
[09:16:55] <ndimatteo> http://nickdimatteo.com/adc/work.html
[09:17:09] <johnkpaul> nascro: I don't see the issue, what is wrong?
[09:17:21] <johnkpaul> aitiba: you're sure you have all of the code exactly from that demo?
[09:17:44] <nascro> @johnkpaul: Hovering multiple photos exposes multiple biography divs underneath the photos, not just one
[09:17:46] <innociv> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage   After I do $('<iframe src="http://site.to.communicate.to" />").appendTo('body'); how do I sendMessage() to the iframe?
[09:18:15] <ndimatteo> if you click the "see all" link, you'll see it pulls in the next page correctly, but a) the "see all" link is not removed, and b) the "more" link that's pulled in, doesn't work as expected (it just takes you to the page)
[09:18:23] <innociv> Because that's a javascript function on a window, not a jquery function on a selector.
[09:18:25] <johnkpaul> nascro: I only see one at any given time
[09:18:41] <nascro> @johnkpaul are you hovering quickly over multiple photos?
[09:18:51] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: there are errors in the chrome devtools console
[09:18:54] <johnkpaul> have you looked into those?
[09:19:41] <ndimatteo> @johnkpaul the only one i'm seeing is for a preload image
[09:19:43] <johnkpaul> nascro: ah I see, so where is the code that should be hiding the other bios
[09:19:52] <ndimatteo> 'progress.gif'
[09:19:53] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: Uncaught TypeError: Object work-3.html has no method 'join'
[09:20:00] <nascro> @johnkpaul http://nathanroberts.com/clients/maloof/js/main.js
[09:20:11] <johnkpaul> nascro: where in that file
[09:20:28] <ndimatteo> yea, that happens when you click the second link, I'm not sure what that is/means, hence posting here :)
[09:20:39] <nascro> @johnkpaul: line 28
[09:20:52] <ndimatteo> it's not removing the first link either when you hit see all, so there's something going wrong before you even get to that
[09:20:54] <nascro> @johnkpaul: // Our Team - Brokerage Team...
[09:20:54] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: so you do see that error?
[09:21:02] <aitiba> johnkpaul, yes I re-download fullcalendar.min.js but the here doesnt fixed
[09:21:05] <ndimatteo> I only see that error when "more" is clicked.
[09:21:13] <johnkpaul> aitiba: there are many more files than that
[09:21:50] <johnkpaul> nascro: this has to do with the timings of your animations
[09:21:56] <johnkpaul> and your lookups for :visible:
[09:21:57] <nascro> @johnkpaul: It's as if the fadeIn/Out method needs to stop before...
[09:22:04] <johnkpaul> yes, it does
[09:22:24] <nascro> @johnkpaul any suggestions on what to look at for doing that?
[09:22:29] <johnkpaul> or maybe don't look up the visible ones, because I don't know how that selector behaves as a fadeout ishapepning
[09:24:10] <aitiba> johnkpaul,  the problem was the cache. Now the example runs
[09:24:16] <johnkpaul> nascro: any reason that you dont' want to add .stop()?
[09:24:18] <johnkpaul> aitiba: ok, good
[09:25:02] <aitiba> johnkpaul, but I dont know how is creating the new views. I take a look to fullcalendar.js
[09:25:19] <johnkpaul> I don't believe that's where it shows you how to create new views, that's the plugin itself
[09:25:22] <johnkpaul> look at some of the demos
[09:25:27] <aitiba> there some views events that declare the views but I dont know where is making the html
[09:25:49] <SmashingX> how can I disable a radiobutton with jquery language?
[09:26:04] <aitiba> johnkpaul, thanls
[09:26:11] <ndimatteo> @johnkpaul any ideas?
[09:26:36] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: have you ever used the step debugger?
[09:26:46] <johnkpaul> I'd recommend putting a break point where that exception is thrown
[09:26:50] <johnkpaul> and looking at the stacktrace
[09:26:56] <ndimatteo> I have not :(
[09:27:09] <johnkpaul> seeing if you can figure out where work-3.html comes from
[09:27:40] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview
[09:27:52] <johnkpaul> actually, https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts
[09:28:24] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: it seems like options.path is intended to be an array
[09:28:26] <johnkpaul> but it is a string
[09:29:42] <nascro> @johnkpaul: at what point would stop() work best?
[09:29:48] <ndimatteo> hmm. I don't even have the path set in the options?
[09:29:56] <ndimatteo> and the default is: path: undefined
[09:30:17] <nascro> @johnkpaul: stopping before/after the fadeIn causes the bio to be invisible
[09:30:18] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: $(".brokers div:visible").not(id).fadeOut --> $(".brokers div").not(id).stop().fadeOut
[09:30:35] <unclemantis> using ui.autocomplete is there a way to display the list even if the data results is zero?
[09:30:41] <nascro> Ah, so chain it to the fade method, not before or after it
[09:30:47] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: I don't know, you'll have to debug through plugins.js to see where it is being set
[09:31:04] <unclemantis> in other words, even if the results is zero, how do i still get open: to trigger?
[09:32:46] <ndimatteo> damn. ok, I'll see what I can do
[09:34:05] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: line 142 of plugins.js
[09:35:42] <ndimatteo> johnkpaul: i'm confused since it works with work-2.html
[09:35:58] <nascro> @johnkpaul: adding stop() seems to solve the problem.
[09:36:05] <nascro> @johnkpaul thanks for your input
[09:36:12] <johnkpaul> nascro: great, no problem
[09:36:26] <nascro> @johnkpaul - easiest answer of the day so far? :)
[09:36:51] <johnkpaul> ndimatteo: hm, I don't know what it's trying to do with that path, I just know why it's not there in the work-1.html case
[09:37:01] <johnkpaul> nascro: :) eh, I haven't really done the statistics

[09:59:22] <rudiX> hi all
[09:59:41] <rudiX> I am trying to build similar to facebook image preview
[09:59:47] <rudiX> http://pastebin.com/PR91kckQ
[10:00:05] <rudiX> the problem is when mosemoves ... it triggers event many times
[10:01:36] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: why are you using mousemove?
[10:02:02] <rudiX> ryanneufeld: moseover does not do desired action
[10:02:13] <ryanneufeld> why do you need mouseover?
[10:02:17] <ryanneufeld> ?demo
[10:02:17] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:02:34] <rudiX> its big image and some information should show some information and hide
[10:02:41] <Whirl3d> Any advice on how to force chrome to reload stylesheets? I have tried refresh, reset, every key combinations, it's just refusing to load a stylesheet change?
[10:03:08] <Whirl3d> nvm
[10:03:52] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: you don't want mouse move if that's what you're doing
[10:04:04] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: you need mouseover, on both the image, and the overlay
[10:04:08] <ThiefMaster> use css :hover or .hover()
[10:04:40] <rudiX> ryanneufeld:  but that will trigger the event only once
[10:04:51] <rudiX> if the mouse is still on the image
[10:05:03] <ThiefMaster> what's the problem with that?
[10:05:09] <ryanneufeld> use hover on the image, and the overlay
[10:05:34] <ryanneufeld> so when you over over the image the over lay shows up, but when you move your mouse over the overlay, it hides
[10:06:00] <rudiX> and end of story ... I want this to repeat
[10:06:23] <rudiX> like - "see me" but not hiding the image
[10:06:53] <rudiX> the closest example is ... imagine this is "body"
[10:07:37] <rudiX> you move mouse ... you get some div with message "you moved the mouse" waits 2 seconds and hides
[10:08:08] <greggies> "here's where the story ends", "see me, feel me"?
[10:08:43] <rudiX> lol if this is a joke :P
[10:08:49] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: it will repeat
[10:08:59] <ryanneufeld> ?hover @ rudiX
[10:09:00] <bot-t> rudiX, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[10:09:03] <rudiX> yeah and it will repeat like crazy
[10:09:27] <rudiX> probably the solution is to disable the event for a while
[10:09:38] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: or, you could change how you're looking at the problem
[10:09:53] <rudiX> yeah basically my logic sux :)
[10:09:57] <ryanneufeld> you're convinced that our suggestion is wrong without even trying it
[10:10:01] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[10:10:12] <rudiX> i tried mouseover
[10:10:35] <rudiX> i had to move mouse outside the image ... to re-trigger event again
[10:10:42] <rudiX> thats something I didnt want :)
[10:11:40] <christatedavies> hello. can anyone help me here with a draggable question? i have asked in jquery-ui but its like a ghost town in there...
[10:11:59] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: USE HOVER
[10:12:05] <ryanneufeld> ?hover @ rudiX
[10:12:06] <bot-t> rudiX, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[10:12:19] <rudiX> oooh
[10:12:20] <rudiX> thanks
[10:12:24] <rudiX> will try that
[10:12:31] <ryanneufeld> geesus LOL
[10:12:40] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ christatedavies
[10:12:41] <bot-t> christatedavies, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:13:07] <rudiX> ryanneufeld: same *hit
[10:13:20] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: ?demo
[10:13:21] <rudiX> ryanneufeld:  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150812392887530&set=a.332251087529.148061.307725332529&type=1&theater can u open that
[10:14:02] <rudiX> the gray bar at the bottom shows and hides on some delay
[10:14:22] <rudiX> and the user is still on the image ... not hovering it
[10:14:44] <christatedavies> i have a div that is floated left to another div, like a list of contents on the left, and then content on the right. in the right div i have more divs, and they have draggable() events attached to them. when i drag them I restrict the axis so it can only go up and down. this all works, but the floated helper is left of the oringal, by the amount of width for the left hand side column... how can i "set" the left of the helper.ui?
[10:15:51] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: I see now
[10:16:25] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: so what you can do for that, is use a mouseover event
[10:16:38] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: and in that event handler, use a setTimeout() call to hide it
[10:16:59] <rudiX> yeah ... thanks for understanding me :)
[10:17:07] <rudiX> I got bad english anyways
[10:17:29] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: np man, a demo is worth 10000 words
[10:17:43] <rudiX> I am preparing it
[10:18:02] <nascro> After submitting a form, I have the form fadeOut and a success message fadeIn. However, the success message fadeIn happens after the div that's fading out. How do I prevent this from happening? So that the fadeIn item appears to load where the fadeOut div once was?
[10:18:04] <ryanneufeld> christatedavies: you can tweak the css for jquery ui to help you with that
[10:18:19] <rudiX> http://jsfiddle.net/2kySK/
[10:18:34] <rudiX> as  u can see it goes like crazy
[10:18:35] <ryanneufeld> nascro: just do a hide() instead of the fadeout, and then fade in.
[10:19:12] <nascro> @ryanneufeld: perfect, thanks!
[10:19:17] <ryanneufeld> nascro: np
[10:19:41] <christatedavies> yeah, good idea ryanneufeld
[10:20:28] <innociv> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage   After I do $('<iframe src="http://site.to.communicate.to" />").appendTo('body'); how do I sendMessage() to the iframe?  Because that's a javascript function on a window, not a jquery function on a selector.
[10:21:31] <rudiX> the delay inside the function is useless
[10:21:43] <rudiX> because the event is triggered anyways
[10:22:28] <rudiX> how to disable $("#imagenext").mousemove(function(event) {
[10:22:42] <rudiX> and then re-enable it
[10:23:58] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/2kySK/2/
[10:24:40] <rudiX> ryanneufeld: WOW maaan ... thanks a lot
[10:24:41] <rudiX> :)
[10:25:01] <ryanneufeld> np, it's not that hard once you see how it's done :P
[10:26:07] <rudiX> facebook could be jelaus about that ... I am pretty sure they got like 30 lines for this :P
[10:27:54] <ryanneufeld> I wouldn't bet on that
[10:29:04] <ryanneufeld> that said, there is about 30 line in jquery and this combined that is doing this :P
[10:30:17] <rudiX> yeah and fb are too proud to use jquery ... I guess
[10:30:18] <rudiX> :)
[10:31:22] <silverwind> FB, like a lot of companies... suffers from the NIH syndrome.
[10:32:08] <silverwind> If I were them, I'd write an API that abstracts jQuery and use it all over the place.
[10:32:18] <rudiX> they can afford writing useless lines of code :) ... fb performs good ... with hardware like this
[10:32:20] <ryanneufeld> NIH?
[10:32:37] <silverwind> (Because you don't want a giant website like FB to depend on jQuery)
[10:32:47] <Evelynn> Hey, i want to select 4th <tr> in table using $('#box>tbody>tr[4]').hide(); but it dosn't work, what am i doing wrong?
[10:32:48] <silverwind> ryanneufeld, Not Invented Here
[10:33:25] <silverwind> ryanneufeld, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIH_syndrome
[10:33:26] <rudiX> even uses PHP and MYSQL ... which is soo old age
[10:33:41] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: our site uses ONE mysql server
[10:33:53] <ryanneufeld> and we do 50mm unique visitors /month
[10:33:56] <rudiX> you should try mongo or couchdb
[10:33:58] <rudiX> :)
[10:34:07] <ryanneufeld> we explored that
[10:34:17] <ryanneufeld> they are only beneficial for high writes
[10:34:25] <silverwind> Indeed.
[10:34:28] <ryanneufeld> our current config out performs it
[10:34:29] <rudiX> and scalability
[10:34:38] <ryanneufeld> we're 99.9% readability
[10:34:42] <silverwind> rudiX, Well... 50mm users..
[10:34:50] <ryanneufeld> rudiX: what's the biggest site you've worked on?
[10:34:59] <silverwind> Seems that caching is good enough for them.
[10:35:02] <rudiX> some fb app
[10:35:10] <ryanneufeld> silverwind: that's about 250million page views ;)
[10:35:28] <rudiX> hosted on 512 ram vps with nginx and another server for couchdb
[10:35:30] <silverwind> ryanneufeld, I guess you're using something like carnish?

[10:38:10] <silverwind> Who uses node.js? :/
[10:38:12] <Evelynn> Hey, i want to hide 4th <tr> in table using $('#table>tbody>tr[4]').hide(); but it dosn't work, is this bug or am i doing something wrong?

[10:38:38] <rudiX> it performs good
[10:38:39] <silverwind> rudiX, node.js is cool... but still, few people use it
[10:38:45] <johnkpaul> Evelynn:  $('#table>tbody>tr').eq(4).hide()
[10:39:07] <rudiX> silverwind: its basically the same as php
[10:39:28] <rudiX> if you care about real time events ... its a MUST
[10:39:40] <rudiX> i write js ... the PHP way
[10:40:01] <rudiX> the cewl thing is you dont switch styles on client and server side
[10:40:54] <SmashingX> how can I disable a radiobutton using jquery language?
[10:41:08] <cody--> If I have something like this: https://gist.github.com/b98b884e25beca90f926 how can i run a function after the $.each is completely finished running
[10:41:36] <silverwind> rudiX, node.js is sooo different than PHP, it's not even funny.
[10:42:48] <Evelynn> johnkpaul: it was actually eq(3), but thanks for directing me to eq function, solved :)
[10:43:19] <johnkpaul> Evelynn: :) great
[10:44:05] <johnkpaul> SmashingX: jquery isn't a language, javascript is the language
[10:44:20] <johnkpaul> but you can do $("input[type=radio").prop("disabled", true)
[10:44:36] <aitiba> I cant get an idea of how can I make views with full calendar
[10:44:46] * silverwind gives an extra ] to johnkpaul 
[10:44:56] <johnkpaul> :) thanks silverwind
[10:45:53] <rudiX> silverwind: trust me mon ... you should try it :)
[10:46:03] <Whirl3d> this should be an easy one, but I have been struggling with it for while today. I have an image that I am "showing" by animating it's height. It's a child of a relatively poisitioned anchor element inline in a scrolling div. How do I tell whether the image is going to be cut off by the top of the scrolling content or not? In other words, how do I tell if my expanded image is in fully in the
[10:46:03] <Whirl3d> viewport?
[10:46:31] <rudiX> and there is awesome modules like jquery ... basically 1:1 js
[10:46:39] <rudiX> jquery itself 1:1
[10:46:56] <rudiX> http://blog.nodejitsu.com/jsdom-jquery-in-5-lines-on-nodejs
[10:47:01] <silverwind> rudiX, I did and I still do use node.js.
[10:47:32] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: what do you mean "the top of the scrolling content"?
[10:47:44] <rudiX> greate silverwind :) ... gotta go
[10:47:49] <rudiX> c ya
[10:47:57] <silverwind> rudiX, But saying that it's close to PHP is so wrong... The asynchronous model imposed by node is a different  challenge...
[10:48:01] <silverwind> Heh..
[10:48:15] <johnkpaul> if the full height of your image is larger than the .height() of your anchor, it will be cut off
[10:48:28] <Whirl3d> http://www.paigeharvey.net/main2.html     - it's a rough draft of my pet project
[10:48:46] <Whirl3d> click on "profile in the top and mouse over a greyed context link
[10:49:58] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I get a 404 for this http://www.paigeharvey.net/profile/main.html
[10:50:24] <Whirl3d> Really? Lemme check that ...OUCH
[10:51:54] <Whirl3d> ooops, didn't push the section content. Try it now
[10:53:18] <shoky> o mai god u stole my css
[10:53:45] <shoky> next time i make u sign NDA
[10:53:53] <Whirl3d> stole whose css?
[10:54:10] <shoky> miiine, for the footer
[10:54:13] <shoky> but i kid.
[10:54:32] <Whirl3d> Are you kidding, you will get FULL credit for the footer CSS, I promise
[10:54:42] <shoky> l0l thats ok ;)
[10:54:54] <byomkeshbakshi> hi I am using toJson method to convert some parameters. But, this method does not seem to handle accented characters in safari. Any dieas?
[10:55:25] <Whirl3d> In fact, I'm putting it in now so I don't forget. Trust me I had planned to give credit to all y'all for the help you have given. Not that many will see the site, but the notion's the same.
[10:59:07] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: so you mean to check if some of the image that appears over the links could be outside of the scrolling div?
[10:59:50] <Whirl3d> yeah. Like if you are halfway scrolled down the page and you mouse over a link, the bird should appear lower on the content so it's not half obscured.
[11:00:18] <johnkpaul> so you're going to have to do some calculation with the offset of the image, and the scrollTop value of .contentBlock
[11:00:28] <imsky> tuuuuesday
[11:00:48] <shoky> izzit
[11:00:53] <Whirl3d> I'm thinking about pulling all the birds out into an overlay (non-scrolled) window and position them based on offset of the link. Then they could extend outide the scrolling content...
[11:01:21] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: that's another option, sure
[11:01:33] <johnkpaul> what would you like to do if it happens to be cut off by the frame?
[11:01:46] <shoky> i think it would be cute if they just stick their heads outside of the scrolling div
[11:01:58] <shoky> this is what i think.
[11:02:03] <shoky> what i think is this
[11:02:16] <Whirl3d> I'll  reposition it so it's fully in view...
[11:02:27] <Whirl3d> I need to capture the scroll event and hide the images if scrolled
[11:02:33] <johnkpaul> so Whirl3d, do the math, and then scroll contentblock to the right place
[11:03:16] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, do you have a link for some help will scrolling. I swear I don't get it for some reason. I tried to make a simple scrollbar and I just got nowhere.
[11:03:17] <johnkpaul> wait, you don't need to handle if the scroll brings the image out of view
[11:03:30] <johnkpaul> but rather if those images are created out of view
[11:03:35] <johnkpaul> IMHO, at least
[11:03:57] <johnkpaul> $(".contentBlock").scrollTop(100)
[11:04:00] <Whirl3d> Right, but I don't want to conflct with the user's primary goal: reading the content. THis is fluff
[11:04:30] <Whirl3d> so it's better to manipulate the fluff than the content, imho
[11:04:40] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: right, so don't do anything unless one of those links are clicked
[11:04:54] <johnkpaul> and if they are, the user is not actively reading anyway
[11:04:58] <shoky> i thought the user's primary goal is to see the cute birdie popups :(
[11:05:03] <johnkpaul> so bring up the image, and scroll to the right position
[11:05:16] <coppa> the Audio data api is just great
[11:06:04] <Whirl3d> hmm. Interesting notion. My goal was to make it so if you clicked the link, it would disable the popup. If you clicked the bird, it would present a modal window with the link's href as it's content. (which is details stuff about the bird)
[11:06:22] <Whirl3d> *in an iframe...
[11:06:55] <johnkpaul> oh, I see, I didn't realize that from what I used
[11:06:59] <byomkeshbakshi> does anyone know if $.toJson handles accented characters incorrectly in Safari?
[11:07:04] <Whirl3d> I did a lot of work trying to use the 3d transforms and unfortunately, they look the same if you ust animate the height.
[11:11:42] <innociv> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage   After I do $('<iframe src="http://site.to.communicate.to" />").appendTo('body'); how do I sendMessage() to the iframe?  Because that's a javascript function on a window, not a jquery function on a selector.
[11:11:48] <innociv> Anyone?
[11:11:55] <innociv> I know it's a really simple answer I just cna't figure it out.
[11:12:20] <innociv> It's something like.. I need the dom variable of the iframe not the jquery one
[11:12:28] <ajpiano> innociv
[11:12:33] <innociv> Yes?
[11:12:43] <ajpiano> just like every single other jquery thing ever, you get the native dom element by using [0] or .get(0)
[11:12:50] <innociv> That' what I thought.
[11:12:59] <innociv> But it's giving me undefined.  Let me look again.
[11:13:30] <innociv> ... Or firebug console isn't setting variables
[11:13:59] <innociv> no it's setting it. but it's empty
[11:14:00] <innociv> []
[11:14:27] <innociv> Ah..
[11:14:31] <innociv> I had a typo ;/
[11:14:47] <raj> jquery-ui tabs doesn't have an option that puts an X in the tab so it can be removed? and additionally, an option that allows for sorting of tabs?
[11:15:32] <shoky> you can put an X
[11:15:42] <shoky> see 'Simple manipulation'
[11:15:46] <shoky> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#manipulation
[11:16:41] <shoky> oh
[11:16:50] <gho5t> does .attr('foo') return null if it doesn't exist? is that why this wors? this.options.title = this.element.attr('data-panel-title') || this.options.title;
[11:16:53] <shoky> // note: closable tabs gonna be an option in the future - see http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/3924
[11:17:14] <supsup> raj: you could use draggable to drag tabs prob...never tried it but seems like u could.
[11:18:06] <shoky> raj you can just make the tabs sortable
[11:18:26] <shoky> its all in the examples there
[11:18:33] <johnkpaul> gho5t: I believe it returns undefined, not null
[11:18:41] <johnkpaul> at least from a quick look at http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.access
[11:18:59] <johnkpaul> but yes, that would work for anything falsy on the left side of ||
[11:18:59] <raj> ohh, didn't see that
[11:19:00] <raj> nice
[11:20:51] <gho5t> ok thanks
[11:21:23] <supsup> raj i thought u ment this : http://jsfiddle.net/sxUtR/  just using examples from jqueryui
[11:22:22] <raj> supsup, yep, that's what I meant :)
[11:22:38] <raj> thanks, you and shoky
[11:23:01] <shoky> hmm
[11:24:03] <shoky> on the topic of jquery ui, anyone know if its easily possible to make buttons drag-clickable? meaning that even if you drag a tiny bit when you just meant to click (or even if you drag a lot on purpose) but your mouseup is still on the button, then it should be clicked
[11:24:31] <shoky> hm i see regular buttons actually are
[11:25:02] <shoky> ok so not buttons, but buttonsets
[11:25:09] <shoky> such as http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#checkbox
[11:25:23] <raj> that's a good usability thought
[11:25:52] <shoky> at work it happens to me a lot i guess cause of a shitty mouse
[11:26:01] <shoky> clicks just dont register
[11:26:02] <johnkpaul> shoky: on mouseup, trigger("click")
[11:26:09] <shoky> yeah :\
[11:26:23] <Whirl3d> so you want to click the button that's dragged on out of the buttonset?
[11:26:23] <shoky> but then i have to listen to mousedown too
[11:26:33] <shoky> and set a flag or whatever
[11:26:53] <shoky> Whirl3d no i just want to click the button, even if i drag some over the button itself
[11:27:01] <shoky> before mouseup
[11:27:07] <raj> so basically a little script that does that for you on an element would be great, allowing for some tolerance of dragging
[11:27:21] <shoky> as long as both the mousedown and mouseup are on the button, it should be clicked. like any button in any normal UI
[11:27:43] <johnkpaul> shoky: oh, do you just want to stop the drag event from happening?
[11:27:53] <shoky> i dont care about the drag event for this purpose
[11:27:55] <koden> hey all I am trying to get this hover to work... basically I need the red box to stay around if the cursor is hovering over it as well... any help? http://jsfiddle.net/shP4P/5/
[11:27:59] <supsup> add the mouseup event on mousedown, on mousedown first flush any previous events?
[11:27:59] <shoky> i just want the click happening
[11:28:20] <shoky> supsup yeah its not hard to do this by myself by listening to various events
[11:28:28] <shoky> but thats not why im using jquery ui
[11:28:50] <supsup> why are you using jquery ui?
[11:29:05] <shoky> cause except for this issue it fits my needs perfectly
[11:29:25] <shoky> and this issue is minor, but still annoying
[11:29:31] <koden> supsup is that for me
[11:29:33] <shoky> and a bug, if you ask me
[11:29:48] <supsup> those buttons have a class it would be one small snipit of code right?
[11:30:08] <koden> nvm
[11:30:11] <shoky> maybe
[11:30:21] <raj> oh, sortable does have a tolerance option
[11:30:55] <raj> suweet
[11:31:02] <supsup> why do you have draggable buttons anyway
[11:31:08] <shoky> theyre not draggable!
[11:31:08] <supsup> seems odd ;-0
[11:31:18] <shoky> you misunderstood the issue completely i think
[11:31:28] <supsup> yah i think so
[11:31:28] <shoky> check this radio buttonset http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio
[11:31:34] <shoky> click-drag a button
[11:31:36] <shoky> it wont be clicked.
[11:31:41] <raj> i know what you want to do too though
[11:32:02] <raj> so that if you change your mind mid-click, you can drag your mouse away and not complete the mouseup over the button, and it won't click it
[11:32:07] <supsup> ah
[11:32:08] <raj> which I do quite often
[11:32:12] <shoky> it should click it
[11:32:17] <shoky> any button in any normal UI does that
[11:32:21] <shoky> try
[11:32:22] <raj> oh, it should?
[11:32:29] <supsup> i never click-drag
[11:32:33] <raj> no, normal buttons don't complete the click if you drag your mouse away
[11:32:37] <shoky> oh sorry, if the mouseup is not over the button then of course, it shouldnt click
[11:32:43] <raj> right
[11:32:52] <supsup> make function onClickDrag that does alert to user to stop that buznes
[11:33:14] <shoky> some people click-drag all the time when they just want to click
[11:33:23] <supsup> gotta roll to meeting.  Thanks for educating me on the click-drag never thought about it
[11:33:26] <shoky> especially if they're agitated ;p
[11:33:27] <raj> shoky, just use sortable, and then release the event when you drag
[11:33:33] <shoky> sortable?
[11:33:36] <supsup> yah never considered it ~
[11:33:39] <raj> like, set a delay of the size of hte button
[11:33:50] <ziz> Anyone able to tell me why the TV looking thing (image/video slider) on this site http://goo.gl/uSr6B works sometimes and other times doesn't.. it's a plastc surgery site so might be nsfw
[11:33:58] <raj> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#delay-start
[11:34:19] <raj> and then run whatever function to cancel the event after the size of the button is reached
[11:34:20] <shoky> not sure how that helps
[11:34:49] <raj> like, if you start dragging and you've reached the distance of the button, return false i suppose
[11:35:04] <shoky> oh
[11:35:05] <raj> it won't visually drag either
[11:35:21] <shoky> nah just listening on mousedown/mouseup on teh buttonset would be simpler i think
[11:35:31] <raj> k
[11:35:49] <shoky> i mean, i'm not sorting or moving anything
[11:35:53] <shoky> just clicking a button
[11:36:41] <shoky> i'd check if there was a bug reported about this
[11:36:51] <shoky> but i'm too lazy
[11:37:21] <koden> can anyone help on this? http://jsfiddle.net/shP4P/5/
[11:37:45] <koden> I want the hover to stay if the user's cursor goes to hover on the red box as well
[11:38:36] <ziz> Anyone
[11:39:07] <shoky> hmm there's this http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6970
[11:39:13] <johnkpaul> Kabaka: http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/shP4P/6/
[11:39:18] <johnkpaul> koden: http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/shP4P/6/
[11:39:27] <johnkpaul> sorry Kabaka, didn't mean you
[11:39:46] <koden> thanks johnkpaul
[11:40:01] <johnkpaul> koden: no problem, have fun
[11:40:19] <freemind> koden?
[11:40:39] <freemind> http://topiat.com/system/images/3733/originals/012020120259/VhlQK.gif
[11:40:42] <freemind> keep it going^^
[11:40:55] <koden> hahaha
[11:40:56] <shoky> great so it was intentional that drag-clicks dont work on buttonsets
[11:40:57] <koden> nice
[11:42:32] <shoky> ajpiano should i file a bug about drag-clicks not registering as clicks on buttonsets ?
[11:42:53] <ajpiano> uh
[11:43:02] <shoky> someone mentioned it in a comment to another bug, but i dont see an actual ticket for this issue
[11:43:21] <ajpiano> feel free to file it if you're liooking for a definitive answer
[11:43:39] <shoky> oks. sry for asking, i just havent filed any bugs.. ever.

[11:48:41] <ryanneufeld> Applications->Utilities->Grab might help
[11:48:44] <Logikos> ALT+PRINTSCREEN key ?
[11:49:08] <ryanneufeld> Logikos: OSX doesn't have that
[11:49:28] <ryanneufeld> It's like CMD+SHIFT+3
[11:49:37] <smykes> nah im looking on pc
[11:49:42] <Logikos> beings he said similar to blah on mac .. i was assuming he was on a pc
[11:49:44] <smykes> on pc they are all shit
[11:49:50] <smykes> i have to take pictures of a website
[11:49:51] <ryanneufeld> smykes: then ALT+PRINTSCR
[11:49:53] <smykes> without the browser
[11:49:54] <Logikos> windows 7 has a sweet snipping tool
[11:50:05] <ryanneufeld> will jave a jpg of the active window to your clipboard
[11:50:09] <smykes> i dont have a print screen button

[11:50:29] <smykes> mac keyboard
[11:50:44] <smykes> theres nothing like little snapper for pc?

[11:51:11] <Logikos> i dont know jack about little snapper or macs...
[11:51:33] <robdodson> is it bad to define a custom HTML attribute for tooltip information? I want something that pops up faster than the title attribute and i want whatever I make to be clickable
[11:51:37] <smykes> i have to take like 25 screenshots and print screen is a pita
[11:51:51] <ryanneufeld> there are browser extensions
[11:51:55] <ryanneufeld> smykes: DYGIT?
[11:52:40] <bobbytek> If I want to use global events in jquery 1.7.2, is the best way to use $(document) as my publisher node?
[11:52:47] <bobbytek> or is there a clearer way?
[11:52:59] <bobbytek> At one point I was using $.event.trigger
[11:53:04] <bobbytek> but that 's private
[11:53:11] <Jon47> robdodson: it's not really bad, just invalid.. if you want it to be valid html5 you can use an attribute that is prefixed by "data-"
[11:53:25] <bobbytek> Why doesn't jquery expose this as a first class api?
[11:53:27] <Jon47> e.g. data-tooltip-info="foo"
[11:53:33] <raj> why is closable tabs gonna be an option in the future?
[11:53:34] <martixy> Hey guys, for some reason this one does not work on my iframe: ".css('height','*=2').css('width','*=2');"
[11:53:37] <raj> seems like its already an option
[11:53:47] <raj> oh, nm, a true option is what's meant
[11:54:18] <gho5t> anyone have any luck altering SVG with jQuery?
[11:54:45] <supsup> i've altered highcharts svg before i think i used their functions tho can't remember
[11:55:08] <gho5t> hmm I'm using fusion charts which i think uses highcharts
[11:55:12] <gho5t> somehow they are related
[11:55:40] <robdodson> Jon47: so data-tooltip could i use that?
[11:55:41] <supsup> just drill down into the chart object
[11:55:52] <Jon47> robdodson sure
[11:56:03] <gho5t> yeah I can log .attr() values but they won't set
[11:56:05] <robdodson> Jo47: sweet thanks!
[11:57:14] <supsup> i did it like this: target_chart.xAxis[0].setCategories(categories);
[11:57:29] <supsup> target_chart.setTitle({text:graphOptions[graphName].graphTitle});
[11:57:31] * shoky just found out about dramatic readings of jquery bugs on youtube
[11:57:33] <supsup> stuff like that
[11:57:34] <shoky> by jq devs.
[11:58:13] <supsup> target_chart.addSeries({name: name[counter], data: array_of_data[counter], color: colorarray[counter] }, false);
[11:59:12] <supsup> i redraw only once after i reorg data.
[11:59:43] <shoky> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=4r5aAhNk4Ws
[11:59:50] <gho5t> maybe i need to fire a redraw function
[11:59:58] <gho5t> and look at their api
[11:59:59] <supsup> target_chart.redraw();
[12:00:16] <supsup> i used Chrom dev tools mostly to find allt he functions
[12:00:20] <supsup> the api is ncie too tho
[12:00:28] <supsup> some functions are not listed in the Api
[12:00:54] <gho5t> i need to move the location of the labels
[12:01:09] <gho5t> do you recall an api function for that
[12:01:31] <supsup> that is done in the Chart Object
[12:02:01] <supsup> think the labels are the series name
[12:02:12] <supsup> so if u change the series name it changes the label
[12:02:23] <shoky> wat.json just gained several new dimensions. thank you ajpiano. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT3xdUueZZA&feature=relmfu
[12:03:02] <supsup> I'd check out the chart options you pass a chart when you make a new one.
[12:03:08] <supsup> it has a lot of options like over 100
[12:06:16] <shoky> PAHAHahahahaaha http://html.slidesharecdn.com/jquery17eventswork-111002124951-phpapp01/output011.png?1317577884

[12:11:55] <LondonGuy> Regarding my question earlier: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10503859/how-do-i-correctly-bind-and-unbind-in-jquery-when-using-changehandler
[12:12:09] <LondonGuy> JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/erU5J/71/
[12:12:37] <LondonGuy> Would appreciate some help if possible. I've tried to recreate the same issue in jsfiddle
[12:12:40] <LondonGuy> Hope that helps
[12:13:34] <ajpiano> uhhhhhhh
[12:13:41] <ajpiano> what is .on().change(function() {}) supposed to do
[12:14:07] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: what ever the intent was it's not doing it
[12:14:10] <johnkpaul> haha
[12:14:38] <LondonGuy> I realise that .on change is pointless. I forget to remove it
[12:14:38] <johnkpaul> .on() is jjust a noop though
[12:15:25] <ajpiano> calling off() with no arguments all over the place sounds like a great way to introduce unexpected problems into your code
[12:16:06] <supsup> on would just return the selector right?  then add a change function handler to the returned selector?  -- I don't use 1.7 ;/.
[12:16:55] <Foxhoundz> jQuery, I need help!
[12:16:59] <ajpiano> ?ask
[12:17:02] <Foxhoundz> Yes yes
[12:17:06] <Foxhoundz> I'm in the process of typing it up
[12:17:38] <Lyfesaver> so he is just forwarning us about an icoming issue....
[12:17:42] <Lyfesaver> i like it =)
[12:17:47] <Lyfesaver> gives one time to duck and hide =)
[12:17:55] <Lyfesaver> lol
[12:18:04] <supsup> your not living up to your name.
[12:18:08] <Foxhoundz> I am using a plugin to animate css color transitions, but I am having trouble animating a color transition from a  color to a backgroundColor property of "none"
[12:18:10] <LondonGuy> lol
[12:18:11] <Lyfesaver> lol
[12:18:14] <Foxhoundz> http://foxhound.privatedns.org/portfolio/#
[12:18:18] <innociv> ajpiano, [0] returns the html of the element.  How do I get a window that I can .sendMessage()?
[12:18:22] <Foxhoundz> That's the offending site
[12:18:41] <ajpiano> innociv: it doesn't return the html, it returns what *looks* like HTML to the console
[12:18:48] <innociv> Oh
[12:18:48] <Foxhoundz> $(this).stop().animate({backgroundColor:"none"}); and the offending code
[12:18:55] <johnkpaul> innociv: iframe.contentWindow
[12:18:57] <ajpiano> innociv: typically iframeElement.contentWindow will be the window
[12:18:57] <innociv> Why can't I sendMessage() then? :/
[12:18:58] <innociv> Okay
[12:20:23] <tplaner___> hey guys, I have multiple lists which are sortable and connected (connectWith), is there an easy method of making the connected lists take priority based on z-index? Currently if two lists are ontop of each other the element which is being sorted flickers between the two lists because it apparently can't determine which one of the lists is on top
[12:21:17] <phpkiddy> i have a php script that outputs a png streight to the browser called image.php
[12:21:58] <phpkiddy> can i make an ajax call to change an <img ..> tag 's source to image.php ?
[12:21:59] <supsup> Foxhoundz try transparent
[12:22:15] <johnkpaul> phpkiddy: you don't need an ajax call for that
[12:22:27] <johnkpaul> phpkiddy: $("img").attr("src","image.php")
[12:22:41] <phpkiddy> will that send the cookie too?
[12:22:59] <phpkiddy> what image.php does is:
[12:23:09] <phpkiddy> it sets up some session variables and creates the png image
[12:23:37] <johnkpaul> phpkiddy: yes, it will be a regular http request from the browser
[12:23:39] <phpkiddy> that's why i think i need to make an jquery ajax call , for the cookie to be sent along as well
[12:23:43] <Foxhoundz> supsup: that did not work
[12:23:59] <unclemantis> why is this not working? https://gist.github.com/e24a02f0b29cb8b89349
[12:24:03] <Foxhoundz> I'm surprised the animate() method does not have native support to animate colors
[12:24:10] <johnkpaul> phpkiddy: the cookie will always be sent for your domain, the browser handles that
[12:24:12] <unclemantis> it was working yesterday... Friday even and now it is not working right
[12:24:26] <johnkpaul> unclemantis: that's not code
[12:24:36] <unclemantis> that is my error log from chrome
[12:24:51] <phpkiddy> @john so: if a browser 'fetches the url domain.com/image.php
[12:24:54] <phpkiddy> because of this line:
[12:25:02] <phpkiddy> <img src='/domain.com/image.php'>
[12:25:11] <phpkiddy> it sends the cookie as well?
[12:25:30] <phpkiddy> assuming you are logged in to a members area of the site for example
[12:25:50] <johnkpaul> phpkiddy: yes
[12:25:58] <johnkpaul> you can look in the chrome devtools/firebug to see the request
[12:26:00] <johnkpaul> and see the cookies
[12:26:06] <phpkiddy> i understand
[12:26:11] <phpkiddy> good to know! thanks
[12:26:19] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun
[12:26:44] <Brodingo> is there some simple code for sorting elements in a jq object? like on a data attribute for instance
[12:27:28] <phpkiddy> that be a javascript question ?
[12:27:42] <johnkpaul> Brodingo: jqObj.toArray().sort(comparator)
[12:28:04] <silverwind> Is the .toArray() necessary?
[12:28:13] <ajpiano> not strictly, but for API "conformance"
[12:28:23] <ajpiano> there is a .sort(fn) on the jQuery.fn but it isn't documented
[12:28:35] <silverwind> Ah ok
[12:28:36] <silverwind> Hmm
[12:28:50] <ajpiano> and doesn't sort the items in the DOM, just in memory, so you have to re-insert after the sort is done
[12:28:57] <silverwind> ?eval $('*').sort
[12:29:00] <bot-t> silverwind: <function sort() {[native code]}>
[12:29:05] * Brodingo nods
[12:29:36] <johnkpaul> oh cool, I didn't know that jq objects had sort
[12:29:48] <johnkpaul> ?eval $().sort === Array.prototype.sort
[12:29:49] <bot-t> johnkpaul: true
[12:29:56] <supsup> Foxhoundz yah looks like you have to fix the plugin
[12:32:39] <supsup> just update calculate color to look for none or transparent
[12:32:41] <supsup> ez pz
[12:33:06] <supsup> u can then submit fix to author and get a high five
[12:35:14] <Parhs> hello guys.. i have some li with class=category .. is it possible to write a selector that would return the li.category that have hidden  the li between them ?
[12:37:09] <supsup> ? hidden-selector
[12:37:10] <bot-t> supsup, :hidden Selector - Selects all elements that are hidden. http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[12:37:45] <Parhs> how can this help ?
[12:38:01] <innociv> Eh so...
[12:38:43] <Parhs> <li class="category" ></li> <li class="blah" ></li> <li class="blah" ></li> <li class="category" ></li>
[12:39:10] <johnkpaul> Parhs: $(".category").first().nextUntil(".category")
[12:39:25] <johnkpaul> confused as to why you need to do that exactly
[12:39:30] <johnkpaul> when you could just $(".blah")
[12:39:54] <supsup> prob more blahs after the last category is only thing i can think of
[12:40:01] <Parhs> because what is between categories is filtered and sometimes not shown
[12:40:19] <supsup> never used .nextUntil ~
[12:40:20] <johnkpaul> oh I see, then yeah, that should work
[12:40:23] <supsup> gotta remember that one
[12:40:54] <Parhs> i'll read about nextUntil but i am thinking whether adding a category id at children would help..
[12:41:41] <Parhs> but that would need a loop for each category
[12:42:06] <supsup> what is odd is structure, why not have <li> <ul><li class='blah'></li> ... </ul></li>
[12:42:46] <supsup> seems like the blahs are really childen of the category
[12:43:15] <coppa> whouhou rock n roll http://binarymind.org/bastien/multitrackHTMLPlayer/
[12:43:33] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/services/synergy-workstation here is an example
[12:43:39] <coppa> with firefox
[12:44:01] <supsup> no-ip have not used that since like 2001
[12:45:13] <Parhs> what do you mean ?
[12:45:29] <supsup> you domain just random observation
[12:45:44] <Parhs> what does my domain has :P?
[12:45:54] <supsup> no-ip.org
[12:46:07] <Parhs> is this strange ?:)
[12:46:12] <supsup> anyway....i suggest you order your nav better.
[12:46:14] <supsup> nope
[12:46:36] <Parhs> add more markup ?
[12:46:54] <supsup> <ul> <li> Category <ul><li>child</li></ul></li><li>...</li></ul>
[12:47:34] <Parhs> i am afraid that it is going to screw the layout
[12:47:43] <supsup> css?
[12:48:20] <Parhs> i dont have time to test all these needed css because it must be finished... yesterday
[12:48:40] <Parhs> the initial requirements didnt need categories thats why i have choosen that
[12:49:07] <supsup> so whats wrong with the current example?
[12:49:22] <Parhs> nothing i should use nextuntil propably..
[12:52:57] <thebignoise> i am clicking on an element with a class of "circles" and want to pass all other
[12:53:14] <thebignoise> "circles" into function exclude the circle i first clicked on
[12:53:36] <thebignoise> into a function excluding*
[12:53:52] <thebignoise> is something like that possible?
[12:54:38] <supsup> prob using index and then checking index of each $(this) on a click
[12:57:19] <thebignoise> supsup: ah very good idea thanks
[12:57:36] <shoky> k i submitted a ticket about that drag-clicking :S   http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8305
[13:06:12] <raj> ajpiano, is there any build that currently has the close option for a tab?
[13:06:17] <supsup> thebignoise assuming something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/N3vJn/
[13:06:29] <ajpiano> what is "the close option for a tab"
[13:06:29] <raj> if you happen to know
[13:06:43] <raj> just an X in the tab that'll close it--> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#manipulation
[13:06:55] <raj> says " note: closable tabs gonna be an option in the future - see http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/3924
[13:07:00] <raj> "
[13:07:07] <thebignoise> exactly. thank you supsup
[13:07:27] <supsup> there prob is some more efficent way to do this
[13:07:46] <ajpiano> raj: i don't believe so, that might be sort of outdated
[13:08:07] <raj> if it's outdated, shouldn't it be in a current release? :)
[13:08:32] <supsup> raj u can just make your own close event. that destorys the related li and div
[13:08:51] <supsup> via remove
[13:08:53] <ajpiano> raj: no i mean the statement that it would ever be included
[13:08:55] <ajpiano> is outdated
[13:09:04] <raj> oh, gotcha
[13:09:24] <raj> why's that? seems like a likely option that would be in there, no?
[13:09:30] <raj> (and useful)
[13:10:24] <supsup> thebignoise oh yah you should prob use .on also i use click etc still since i dont use 1.7
[13:10:39] <raj> yeah, instead of live
[13:10:48] <raj> oh, someone else :)
[13:10:53] <thebignoise> supsup: okay will do
[13:11:26] <supsup> 1.6.4 is as far as I go.  Jquery was perfected in that version any change now will just diminish the pureness, or so my boss tells me when i ask to upgrade
[13:11:59] <NoiseEee> supsup: sweet!!!11
[13:12:03] <ajpiano> raj: read this http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/tabs-api-redesign/
[13:12:19] <silverwind> 1.7 is the first jquery that I actually like...
[13:12:30] <supsup> i liked 1.2 best
[13:12:37] <ajpiano> raj: i would say that it wouldn't be an option by default because it's easy to add in yourself
[13:12:47] <ajpiano> and then that's just more code we have to support
[13:13:06] <ajpiano> raj: jquery ui is trying to be more like "here's a base, extend it" instead of "guess every feature"
[13:13:32] <raj> k
[13:13:41] <raj> thanks for hte link, this is informative
[13:13:48] <silverwind> I dislike jqueryui :/
[13:13:50] <Teycho> im using jquery to change the image of my submit button, but it seems because the form is immediately posting as that change occurs, the browser doesn't actually change the image (or allow it time to redraw).  if I event.preventDefault() within my method to change the image, the image changes as expected. Any way to force the image to redraw or give a little delay for it to change?
[13:13:56] <raj> when's the expected release date for 1.9, if you know?
[13:14:17] <ajpiano> there is no set date
[13:14:37] <zoned> how do enable/disable a radio button with jquery? .attr("disabled","disabled") ??
[13:14:38] <raj> k
[13:14:46] <supsup> i think jqueryui is pretty good, people just don't read the api or understand css rules very well
[13:14:55] <skylamer`> zoned, setAttr
[13:15:08] <raj> supsup, it's definitely good/useful, doubt anyone questions that
[13:15:10] <zoned> or .prop?
[13:15:12] <silverwind> zoned, use .prop, it's nicer
[13:15:27] <zoned> .prop("disabled", true/false) ?
[13:15:30] <silverwind> Yeah
[13:15:37] <ajpiano> raj: there are plenty of people who question :p
[13:15:54] <raj> that's just silly
[13:16:14] <supsup> naw what silly is a billy goat on a boat
[13:16:16] <raj> it provides some of the most commonly needed ui tools
[13:16:43] <raj> i dunno how I feel about it just being a "base" and needing you to extend it though
[13:16:57] <raj> seems like a lot of good features may be lost in that goal
[13:17:21] <antipattern> ajpiano: what are the most common criticisms? am a user and a fan personally, just curious
[13:17:41] <ajpiano> people complain about it being "bloated"
[13:17:51] <raj> antipattern, are you a spanish speaker?
[13:17:52] <ajpiano> often they can't point exactly to what they'd make smaller
[13:18:05] <antipattern> raj: no, i just phrased that strangely
[13:18:22] <ajpiano> antipattern: another is of the interactions, just get really buggy in edge cases
[13:18:29] <ajpiano> which we're aware of and yrying to fix for 1.9
[13:18:52] <ajpiano> other people don't like the API and having to call methods as strings
[13:18:54] <supsup> Ajpiano but if only i did not have to include all them widgets i don't use if only there was a way...
[13:19:08] <silverwind> ajpiano, I don't see it as being bloated.... but impossible to customize/theme
[13:19:21] <supsup> its pretty basic css imo
[13:19:28] <ajpiano> silverwind: yes that is another reasonable critique
[13:19:40] <ajpiano> another change that is planned for 1.9 is to separate the presentational classes from the structural classes
[13:19:55] <ajpiano> so you can keep the part that keeps like, tabs in a tab shape and hiding the inactive ones
[13:19:57] <silverwind> supsup, you modify a single thing... it reflects in the whole damn framework because all the widgets use the same damn CSS
[13:20:01] <ajpiano> but not have the colours or corners etc etc
[13:20:06] <supsup> nope silverwind
[13:20:11] <supsup> io make a new rule specific to the div i'm in
[13:20:13] <silverwind> supsup, It's fine on a CMS... but sucks for a websit.
[13:20:36] <supsup> since the rule is more specific, it wins and only works in that div
[13:20:41] <supsup> basic css
[13:20:42] <ajpiano> silverwind: you just have to not *modify* the css, but instead write more specific rules in a separate file
[13:20:55] <ajpiano> that preserves your upgrade path and helps with maintainability
[13:20:59] <silverwind> ajpiano, I would like to write my own theme
[13:21:12] <ajpiano> silverwind: yeah, that's the idea of separating the things apart
[13:21:14] <supsup> what's stopping you?
[13:21:16] <antipattern> yeah, i've definitely been frustrated trying to use the css namespacing in themeroller.  like how would you customize a style for a pop up that has no containing element? like dialogs and datepickers?
[13:21:34] <thebignoise> im in a bit of a pickle. i have this 'game' where i have to check the collisions of sprites, that works fine, and its crucial they dont collide. but all user has to do is unbind my collision check and manipulate the game.
[13:21:42] <ajpiano> antipattern: you can add more classes to the elements and use that as theming hooks, is one way
[13:21:43] <thebignoise> is there a way to circumvent this?
[13:21:43] <adamA7> Why I am banned from gentoo channel?
[13:21:57] <ajpiano> adamA7: we don't know, we're the #jquery channel
[13:22:16] <Teycho> that answers that
[13:22:32] <supsup> thebignoise not if it's all client side with no server side checks.
[13:22:53] <thebignoise> well even if i do server side checks
[13:23:00] <thebignoise> the checks are going to be triggered client side
[13:23:16] <truk77> Can somebody recommend a plugin that gives a non-blocking "status area" that I can use to put brief messages into (e.g., "saving", "transferring", etc)
[13:23:26] <thebignoise> and can be unbound
[13:23:28] <supsup> yah but you could analyze data and set limits.
[13:23:34] <shoky> non-blocking?
[13:23:34] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7053 silverwind
[13:23:57] <thebignoise> supsup: im not sure what you mean
[13:24:32] <silverwind> ajpiano, That would be GREAT.
[13:24:39] <supsup> yah i'm no expert at games, just seems like you would need server side checks
[13:24:47] <shoky> thebignoise: just assume that the user can change anything in the browser
[13:24:54] <shoky> and you're set.
[13:25:05] <ajpiano> thebignoise: shoky is right.... in a game you can't trust the data from the client really
[13:25:08] <thebignoise> shoky: well that will defeat the entire purpose of the game
[13:25:20] <supsup> just for people who ch eat
[13:25:22] <antipattern> thebignoise: welcome to multi player game development
[13:25:28] <thebignoise> haha
[13:25:36] <supsup> if it's a stand alone game -- what does it matter
[13:25:41] <supsup> people cheat...great
[13:25:54] <thebignoise> its a multiplayer game based of stats and shit
[13:26:00] <ajpiano> thebignoise: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj1qTrpuXJ8 is a good talk that gets into, at one point, why you can't trust stuff from the client
[13:26:08] <supsup> ah yah if it's multi u need tons of server side checks ;-0
[13:26:24] <antipattern> thebignoise: you can't hide/protect client side data from the client, it's not even a browser issue. it's true in desktop games too.
[13:26:27] <lotus> hey, I'm working on a jquery menu slider (I know there are "dropdown" menu libraries out there, but I need something similar to Amazon's menu system) -- http://jsfiddle.net/7PwY6/
[13:26:31] <thebignoise> supsup: right but even then most of the server side check are going to be triggered by client side actions
[13:26:41] <supsup> you need database triggers too setup to monitor data input to system
[13:26:42] <thebignoise> and those actions can be altered
[13:26:51] <ajpiano> thebignoise: furthermore, you should be wrapping your code in enough closure and obfuscation by the time it reaches the client that they aren't just have particularly easy access to just start unwinding parts of your canvas code
[13:26:59] <supsup> you need a way to find out hacked values
[13:27:12] <shoky> i dont think he's using a canvas...
[13:27:13] <lotus> The problem is that when you hover over the first item, the element being added has a different width when it's being removed -- you can see the width's outputted in the console (thanks to console.log)
[13:27:22] <thebignoise> nope no canvas
[13:27:23] <supsup> definatly not my strong point, there are whole books written about this though
[13:27:25] <supsup> i'd check them out
[13:27:35] <antipattern> ajpiano: that's only effective if no one really wants to get access ...
[13:28:22] <ajpiano> i'm pretty sure the only real way around it is only to communicate input to the server and the client, perform calculations in both places
[13:28:35] <ajpiano> and then pass the state from the server back to the client and have it make any corrections
[13:28:43] <ajpiano> that's what rob talks about in that video
[13:28:52] <shoky> yes the server has to have a full model of the game data
[13:29:52] <shoky> anything that is related to the multiplayer aspect, at least
[13:30:25] <gho5t> anyone know why setting an svg attributes won't work but doing something like .remove() does
[13:30:48] <gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/4eqEC/1/
[13:33:22] <supsup> does not appear remove is working, what is it doing exactly
[13:33:55] <gho5t> remove will remove the nodes
[13:34:10] <supsup> does not appear to
[13:34:11] <gho5t> but my example is setting attr()
[13:34:15] <supsup> maybe jsfiddle is wrong
[13:34:16] <shoky> remove works
[13:34:19] <supsup> o
[13:34:21] <supsup> ok
[13:34:23] <supsup> misread
[13:34:30] <johnkpaul> gho5t: it works for me
[13:34:42] <gho5t> johnkpaul: setting an attr()?
[13:34:46] <gho5t> can you post an update?
[13:35:16] <johnkpaul> when I click on click me, in the svg, the x attribute of all of the text elements is 500
[13:35:17] <gho5t> if you log .attr('x') it looks like an object
[13:35:24] <gho5t> hmm
[13:35:28] <gho5t> does it actually move
[13:35:38] <johnkpaul> no, hmm
[13:36:19] <johnkpaul> perhaps look into http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2544686/how-to-make-chrome-redraw-svg-dynamically-added-content
[13:36:19] <shoky> i think jquery just doesnt work as expected with SVG DOM
[13:36:38] <johnkpaul> shoky: in chrome 17, I see the attributes set to 500
[13:36:48] <shoky> i also see that
[13:37:06] <shoky> but if you go change it manually in the elements view, they'll move
[13:37:24] <shoky> it's because of the namespacing issue i think
[13:37:40] <supsup> well first off $('svg text') is an array.  so your going to have to target the index of the array u want
[13:37:51] <shoky> why?
[13:38:05] <shoky> .attr works on collections
[13:38:06] <supsup> the array has attr x?
[13:38:12] <gho5t> supsup: i'm just moving them allfor now
[13:38:16] <gho5t> all for
[13:38:22] <shoky> supsup: all jquery objects are 'array's
[13:38:22] <johnkpaul> supsup: it's actually a jquery object, which is array-like but not an array
[13:38:41] <johnkpaul> I don't know much about how svg works and if setting the attribute should *just work*
[13:38:45] <supsup> ok
[13:38:56] <shoky> jquery doesn't do the namespacing
[13:38:58] <gho5t> shoky: what can I do about the namespacing issue, if anything?
[13:38:58] <johnkpaul> supsup: it has integer indexes and a .length property
[13:39:07] <shoky> it uses setAttribute, not setAttributeNS
[13:39:11] <shoky> (i think)
[13:39:29] <shoky> gho5t: see johnkpaul's link
[13:39:39] <gho5t> yeah I'm reading it. not sure I understand it
[13:39:48] <gho5t> does this mean i have to use native javascript
[13:39:55] <shoky> i believe so
[13:40:07] <shoky> or use a jquery svg plugin
[13:40:12] <gho5t> ok. and can you explain the namespace issue?
[13:40:17] <gho5t> so I can tell my lead
[13:41:01] <johnkpaul> gho5t: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_namespace
[13:41:07] <shoky> umm i dont know that much about it, but the SVG elements are contained in some xml namespace
[13:41:10] <johnkpaul> .attr assumes the regular dom's set attribute
[13:41:19] <johnkpaul> svg is a _different_ namsepace
[13:41:50] <gho5t> gotcha
[13:47:45] <raj> how can I rename and re-id the tabs to the correct numerical order after sorting? http://jsfiddle.net/sxUtR/2/
[13:48:12] <raj> i suppose the correct way to do it would be a callback function within sortable
[13:48:15] <ryanneufeld> raj, I would keep the ids, but use a data attribute instead
[13:48:22] <ryanneufeld> and yes, using a callback would be the way
[13:48:23] <raj> ryanneufeld, why's that?
[13:48:36] <ryanneufeld> just my opinion :p
[13:49:17] <raj> sure, but why would you keep the ids?
[13:49:41] <ryanneufeld> ids are intended to be a unique identifier
[13:49:58] <ryanneufeld> $('#item').data(
[13:50:03] <raj> yeah, so I'm just reversing them
[13:50:10] <raj> so they'd still be unique
[13:50:29] <ryanneufeld> do what you like, I'm just saying it would be cleaner solution
[13:50:40] <ryanneufeld> ?data() @ raj
[13:50:40] <bot-t> raj, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:50:42] <raj> i hear you, but I'm just asking why
[13:50:45] <raj> i'm familiar with data
[13:50:55] <supsup> why do you care to reorg them?
[13:51:06] <supsup> that may cause conflict perhaps.
[13:51:18] <raj> how so?
[13:51:27] <supsup> the tabs is using them
[13:51:29] <ryanneufeld> raj: like I said, it's only my opinion, I think leaving the ids is better as then you always know that ID=XXXX is always that tab
[13:51:30] <supsup> when u click
[13:52:28] <raj> right, I was gonna change the href of the tab and id of the div
[13:52:35] <ryanneufeld> I always treat the ID as immutable, it's the one thing I know I can 100% rely on to be the same for that element, every time
[13:52:43] <raj> ok
[13:52:44] <ryanneufeld> raj, why?
[13:53:02] <supsup> yah whats the point seems like just extra work for no reason
[13:53:11] <raj> cuz the id has mydiv, mydiv2, mydiv3, etc
[13:53:17] <raj> so I was gonna utilize that info when posting
[13:54:21] <ryanneufeld> you're defeating the purpose of dynamic tabs then
[13:54:38] <raj> ya?
[13:54:42] <ryanneufeld> if you need some data about what tab was clicked, than you can pass it as a GET param in the href, or use a data attr
[13:55:09] <supsup> if u want u could add callback to sortable via stop  --- do calculations based on current index, but u would have to change all the ones before the current index
[13:55:20] <supsup> also unsure if this will then break tabs()
[13:55:26] <supsup> u can try it out tho!
[13:55:31] <raj> it's fine, I'll use data :)
[13:55:35] <raj> i just wanted to know why
[13:58:00] <angrywombat> does anyone have any insight as to why i would be getting a "invalid label" errors in firebug when trying to eval() the responseText of an .ajax({...}) call?
[13:58:21] <angrywombat> the only thing googling does for me is turn up results regarding jsonp (and im not using different domains)
[13:58:32] <johnkpaul> angrywombat: because a json object by itself is not valid javascript
[13:58:36] <ajpiano> why would you be evaling the responseText of an ajax call
[13:58:50] <angrywombat> ajpiano: because i essentially have no idea what i am doing
[13:58:55] <ryanneufeld> raj: It's good that you ask why.
[13:58:57] <johnkpaul> ?parseJSON @angrywombat
[13:58:58] <bot-t> angrywombat, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[13:59:09] <johnkpaul> or have your backend send content type application/json
[13:59:13] <raj> i like to think so ;)
[13:59:13] <angrywombat> johnkpaul: thank you
[13:59:18] <johnkpaul> or add  dataType:"json"
[14:00:27] <shoky> raj: remember my earlier point about not messing with the ui widgets (e.g. something you called .tabs() on)
[14:00:38] <shoky> especially about IDs of tabs
[14:00:44] <angrywombat> johnkpaul: worked perfectly, thanks again
[14:00:55] <shoky> even if you do that, and change the hrefs, and it works, that's an ugly hack solution
[14:01:00] <johnkpaul> np, angrywombat
[14:01:00] <shoky> that might stop working
[14:01:13] <raj> ok
[14:01:25] <raj> so data, data, data
[14:02:22] <shoky> data is key
[14:02:52] <raj> and should I just have a separate event listener for my <span>X</span> that removes the <li> of the tab and its corresponding href referenced div?
[14:02:56] <shoky> raj i'm not really sure why you even need data
[14:03:09] <shoky> i mean, what're you after
[14:03:31] <raj> cuz when I POST to the server, I need to know the order of the tabs and corresponding divs
[14:03:47] <raj> i guess I can add an extra POST parameter for that
[14:03:56] <raj> but that's messier serverside
[14:04:12] <shoky> tabs AND correspondig divs?
[14:04:20] <shoky> they're in the same order, no?
[14:04:50] <raj> i'm not sure if .tabs() reorders the corresponding divs
[14:04:56] <raj> i mean, sortable()
[14:05:07] <ryanneufeld> raj, I had do something similar with a sort, so what Idid was have a .data attr that stored the order
[14:05:18] <shoky> reorders them in the dom you mean?
[14:05:26] <shoky> i dont see why it should
[14:05:36] <raj> yeah, I didn't think it did
[14:05:57] <shoky> so all you're missing is one piece of data: the order of the tabs
[14:05:58] <shoky> ?
[14:06:21] <raj> guess so, yeah
[14:06:55] <shoky> and how would you send it without an extra POST parameter?
[14:07:48] <raj> so do I just on.('click', 'li#tab1', function(e){$(e.target).parent('li').remove()}) ?
[14:08:11] <raj> shoky, if I renamed the id's I wouldn't have to send an additional post parameter
[14:09:06] <shoky> ah
[14:09:40] <dawin> hi folks :)
[14:10:58] <shoky> raj for closing you need to call .tabs('remove', index)  on the right tab, like they do in the example
[14:11:02] <shoky> i suppose
[14:11:24] <raj> ah, ok, exactly what I wanted to know, thank you :)
[14:11:33] <shoky> ;)
[14:12:14] <shoky> and regarding the tabs order i'd indeed go with .data like ryanneufeld suggests
[14:12:20] <dawin> its not related to jquery but, do any of you know of a image comparison api, engine that is free? like the tineye api
[14:13:55] <shoky> dawin: you can prolly find tons of opensource stuff. but maybe not javascript ;P
[14:14:04] <gho5t> johnkpaul: shouldn't this work for my svg issue then? http://jsfiddle.net/4eqEC/3/
[14:14:28] <dawin> shoky: i didnt find any so far x.x, and it doesnt have to be in js xD
[14:14:41] <shoky> gho5t: you need to follow what they did in the SO answer
[14:14:50] <shoky> with the xml namespace and setAttributeNS
[14:15:09] <shoky> dawin ok lemme see if i find smth
[14:15:27] <shoky> got someth more speficic than 'image comparison api' ?
[14:15:41] <johnkpaul> gho5t: listen to shoky, you need setAttributeNS
[14:16:03] <gho5t> ah ok
[14:17:16] <dawin> shoky: i dont search for a simple app, it has the be a server in the end xD
[14:17:26] <shoky> wat
[14:18:05] <gho5t> wouldn't this work then: http://jsfiddle.net/4eqEC/6/
[14:18:28] <dawin> a visual comparision server wich is capable of searchin in like 3k pics, has to take less then 1 min
[14:18:30] <aitiba> hi
[14:19:12] <dawin> i found 1 opensource server so far, i tried it, i searched for bananas it delivered me some polar bears x.x
[14:19:43] <aitiba> someone can help me with full calemndar. I cant view how can I make my own views
[14:20:26] <gho5t> johnkpaul: wouldn't this work then: http://jsfiddle.net/4eqEC/6/
[14:22:02] <johnkpaul> gho5t: I would assume so, but I don't know enough to tell you why it is not
[14:22:08] <multiHYP> hi all
[14:22:11] <gho5t> ok
[14:22:28] <multiHYP> fadeIn() fades something in, but is there a property to set via css to hide() it by default?
[14:24:59] <_zoggy_> hmm
[14:25:25] <_zoggy_> building custom jui theme results in only a custom.min.js file.. what happen to the non minifed version
[14:25:39] <multiHYP> got it, display: none;
[14:25:53] <_zoggy_> and minification appears to have been much better in 1.8.18 vs 1.8.20
[14:26:53] <aitiba> someone can help me with full calemndar. I cant view how can I make my own views
[14:27:10] <raj> what's the meaning of $('li', $someselector).index($(this).parent()) ? namely the 'li',$someselector
[14:27:28] <raj> i thought comma is to select multiple things
[14:28:02] <silverwind> raj, In a selector, yes
[14:28:05] <nFFF> $('.foo, .bar') is multpiple
[14:28:22] <silverwind> raj, If you look more closely, you'll see that the function has 2 parameters.
[14:28:33] <nFFF> $('.foo','.bar') == $('.bar').find('.foo');
[14:28:41] <silverwind> raj, The second parameter is the "context" (the starting node)
[14:28:50] <raj> oh
[14:29:01] <raj> so that's not a multiple selector (as in, a replacement for .add()
[14:29:11] <raj> ...which is what I originally thought
[14:29:15] <antipattern> _zoggy_: isn't there a "development" directory in your download also?
[14:29:15] <silverwind> raj, you could use .find instead.
[14:29:27] <antipattern> _zoggy_: or maybe "dev", somethign like that
[14:29:38] <_zoggy_> ok yeah, so they split it out now
[14:29:53] <_zoggy_> development-bundle/ui/
[14:30:05] <raj> I don't understand how this code has 'li' as the parent for $tabs then, shouldn't the first item be the "parent" element of sorts--> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#manipulation
[14:30:19] <raj> ...or as you said, context
[14:32:02] <silverwind> raj, I cannot see it :/
[14:32:11] <raj> var index = $( "li", $tabs ).index( $( this ).parent() );
[14:32:25] <raj> in View Source
[14:33:18] <silverwind> We're not on the same page it seems..
[14:33:38] <raj> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#manipulation
[14:33:54] <raj> if you click on View Source, it's towards the bottom
[14:34:45] <silverwind> Anyway.. I cannot see it.
[14:35:10] <silverwind> The context is just the root element... if you don't specify it, it's the <body>
[14:35:27] <raj> you can just search for that phrase really
[14:35:27] <silverwind> or <html>... not sure.
[14:35:33] <nFFF> raj
[14:35:38] <silverwind> raj, I did.
[14:35:44] <nFFF> its $($tabs).find('li')
[14:35:58] <nFFF> or $tabs.find('li')
[14:36:04] <raj> but I don't understand how the context is deeper in the dom tree than the "$tabs"
[14:36:12] <nFFF> $tabs is the context!
[14:36:13] <raj> nFFF, so it's backwards?"
[14:36:16] <raj> ok
[14:36:23] <raj> then that makes sense
[14:37:00] <raj> thank you
[14:39:36] <VRN|Shade> Good Evening! I have a question about an ajax-form, that actually isnt working for some reason i couldnt find yet. If you are interested in helping me: http://pastebin.com/EwWMHCuT you are welcome. :)
[14:41:44] <shoky> what's the question?
[14:41:58] <VRN|Shade> Its inside the pastebin, at the top :)
[14:42:04] <raj> you're welcome?
[14:42:06] <raj> haha
[14:42:35] <shoky> oh its there
[14:44:59] <shoky> VRN|Shade: does it work with 'return false' ?
[14:47:39] <VRN|Shade> Nope. Still opening the site. At least the validation is working, it sends me the JSON.
[14:48:15] <shoky> maybe put e.preventDefault() as first line, dunno
[14:48:30] <shoky> nm
[14:49:46] <VRN|Shade> No good idea. :P
[14:50:59] <VRN|Shade> But at least thats the proof preventDefault is working in that case. So the problem is in the ajaxForm function.
[14:52:20] <shoky> it works when you put it first?
[14:54:30] <VRN|Shade> Yeah, but then the ajaxForm function will not be called.
[14:54:37] <shoky> it wont?
[14:56:05] <VRN|Shade> Nope
[14:56:36] <shoky> if you put console.log('blarg') as first line in ajaxForm()
[14:56:41] <shoky> do you see it
[14:57:52] <VRN|Shade> Oh.
[14:58:16] <VRN|Shade> Now i learned something new. :) Actually, the ajaxForm() is called.
[14:58:34] <shoky> yeah, log stuff
[15:00:05] <shoky> if that's news to you, you should definitely watch:

[15:02:35] <ryanneufeld> freemind: no

[15:10:48] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I'm having a good day, I have cookies, and I mean the kind I can eat
[15:11:23] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: Thanks for the support. freemind if you need some help with jquery that's why we're here
[15:11:45] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: where you at?
[15:11:56] <raj> ryanneufeld, any idea how to disable sorting in the 'start' callback?
[15:11:58] <raj> returning false doesn't work
[15:12:04] <freemind> ryanneufeld, your friend, is he providing the tcl script for the bot?
[15:12:38] <ryanneufeld> freemind: I was only kidding. I don't actually know the person who wrote it. I just know the command to make it remember stuff
[15:12:58] <freemind> ok ryanneufeld
[15:13:27] <ryanneufeld> raj: you want to disable sorting in the start? You realize that the start callback being called means sorting is enabled
[15:13:54] <raj> well, basically, if there's 1 tab, I don't want the tabs to be moveable
[15:14:04] <raj> I thought 'start' would be a good time to determine that
[15:16:09] <ryanneufeld> then check for only one tab before you call sortable?
[15:16:16] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ raj
[15:16:17] <bot-t> raj, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:18:41] <raj> ryanneufeld, but I can add/remove tabs
[15:18:49] <aitiba> someone can help me with full calemndar. I cant view how can I make my own views
[15:21:05] <Gsingh> Hi, I'm trying to obtain the request url the server hands me through an ajax call how would i do this?
[15:21:05] <ryanneufeld> raj, how are you adding/removing tabs?
[15:21:32] <ryanneufeld> raj: where ever that logic is, is where you'll have to make a call to the sortable to change it's enable/disabled state
[15:21:42] <ryanneufeld> raj: it's in the jqui docs how to do that
[15:22:07] <ryanneufeld> Gsingh: you're making an ajax request, and you don't have the url?
[15:23:53] <Sazpaimon_> is there a method to see what position in a selector another selector is?
[15:24:41] <Sazpaimon_> for example, if I wanted to find the position in a selector of $("li") of an li with class "disabled"
[15:25:22] <Gsingh> ryanneufeld: I mean the url that the server is returning to me after I make the ajax request
[15:25:56] <raj> ryanneufeld, k, then I'll do it that way
[15:25:58] <Gsingh> when i try to using something like "this.url" I get the current url that my browser has in the bar
[15:26:24] <raj> ryanneufeld, I just thought i'd be able to do it the other way as well
[15:26:27] <ryanneufeld> ?pe @ Gsingh
[15:26:27] <bot-t> Gsingh, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. If I can't easily edit and save the code back, I'm not going to help you. Make it easier for me to help you by helping me
[15:26:59] <ryanneufeld> raj: yeah, the sortables callbacks don't really work that way
[15:27:10] <Gsingh> I can't paste my code, sorry that's not an option for me.
[15:27:14] <ryanneufeld> raj: the UI guys do some sorcery that I don't quite grok
[15:27:19] <ryanneufeld> Gsingh: sorry I can't help you then
[15:27:30] <ryanneufeld> unless you can better explain your problem
[15:28:06] <superthebobfredm> I'm trying to get data from the target of an event.  I'm doing e.target.data('for');  But I'm getting an error:  e.target.data is not a function.  Any thoughts?
[15:28:27] <superthebobfredm> I'm a little less than awesome with jQuery and Javascript
[15:28:55] <superthebobfredm> oh.  and e.target.id  IS what I think it should be (the id of the element I'm trying to hit)
[15:31:17] <Gsingh> Basically I am trying to redirect my page, however since im using ajax it does not redirect but rather the page content of the url that is sent to me is loaded into the DOM object that the ajax call refers to.
[15:31:57] <Gsingh> So I need a way to redirect from the ajax call.
[15:32:29] <superthebobfredm> nevermind.  somehow i was getting an event that was non-jqueried
[15:32:54] <lapistano> Gsingh, ever thought of Http Status codes?
[15:33:02] <Gsingh> I want to get the URL that the server sends me and just use that to redirect by loading into window.locatin.href
[15:33:23] <Gsingh> yes but I want to use the params in the url
[15:33:45] <xp_prg2> I am in tree view hell, anyone good at creating hierarchical tree structures that are collapsable?
[15:44:23] <elguapo99> is it possible to make a webform alter its destination page based on answers to questions?  Ideally I want to have some questions for a test, do some arithmetic, and route to a specific page based on the result
[15:46:17] <xp_prg2> yes it is elquapo99
[15:46:25] <xp_prg2> $.post is your friend
[15:48:34] <Schyzo> I have an odd behavior with jquery autocomplete
[15:49:00] <Schyzo> I have put together a remote call with HTML rendering and categories
[15:49:20] <Schyzo> Everything was fine before putting the categories but now, I have an error raised when using the keyboard...
[15:49:23] <biberao> yo
[15:49:38] <Schyzo> Removing the HTML rendering seems to fix the issue though
[15:54:46] <biberao> a jquery plugin goes inside jquery.js or is it external?
[15:59:45] <biberao> i found the answer
[16:01:31] <Sanden> omg how I hate IE9. make that all IE. ::slams head on desk::
[16:03:01] <Emn1ty> I still feel IE should just install FF, or Chrome for that matter.
[16:03:40] <Emn1ty> Why try to keep up with a browser 40% of their users only open to download a different browser?
[16:08:58] <Schyzo> http://jsfiddle.net/tReg7/2/ Here you can see the error I have with the autocomplete
[16:09:06] <Schyzo> Really not sure what is wrong with it
[16:10:10] <Sanden> Emnlty: because PeopleSoft/Oracle says it's a required browser and therefore I have to build for it.
[16:12:03] <Emn1ty> Sanden: then take comfort in the fact IE6 is no longer supported.
[16:12:48] <Schyzo> Emn1ty: but some companies still pays MS for special support ;)
[16:13:00] <Sanden> Emnlty: I did, but then IE has 10 out now?
[16:13:27] <tw2113> i only support IE8+
[16:13:40] <tw2113> out of box
[16:13:46] <tw2113> IE7 as "necessary"
[16:14:16] <Emn1ty> Same here, tw2113
[16:14:59] <Emn1ty> unfortunately, the "as necessary" is quite frequent due to making auto dealer websites.
[16:15:20] <Sanden> Sadly, that's not the case here, although our tools version only says IE 7 and 8
[16:15:22] <tw2113> get better clients with different target markets :P
[16:15:41] <johnwarren> I want to jQuery hover over a particular <div class="mydiv">‚Ä¶and then fire an event as if I am hovering over a completely different anchor, which I will class as <a class="destination">. What's the way to make A.Destination think it is being hovered over?
[16:16:27] <Emn1ty> tw2113: Or we can just get everyone to upgrade their browser :P. My boss already replaced the PC's in one dealership with brand new ones.
[16:16:44] <tw2113> it's a step in the right direction
[16:17:08] <tw2113> isn't MS forcing everyone up to at least 8?
[16:17:28] <shoky> t
[16:17:36] <Emn1ty> yes, but some people just avoid updating at all costs. I remember my parents telling me to never update because it can screw up your computer.
[16:17:39] <tw2113> return 1, shoky ?
[16:17:42] <Emn1ty> that conception still exists
[16:17:44] <shoky> yes plz
[16:17:55] <johnwarren> NEVER UPDATE: IT CAN SCREW UP YOUR COMPUTER
[16:17:57] <johnwarren> j
[16:17:58] <johnwarren> jk
[16:18:03] <johnwarren> ok i am going to use .trigger(), thanks
[16:18:09] <Schyzo> tw2113: it is very expensive for some big companies to migrate from one version to another one
[16:18:23] <Schyzo> (and I am not talking about hardware)
[16:18:30] <Schyzo> That is why it takes time
[16:18:33] <Emn1ty> No, it is expensive
[16:19:02] <Emn1ty> A lot of software/internal workflow needs to be changed at times when they change even the simplest things.
[16:19:04] <Schyzo> It takes a huge amount of time to retest all the applications they have with the new browser version
[16:19:35] <tw2113> are you making websites for the companies to use internally or for their customers? :P
[16:20:03] <Schyzo> tw2113: it depends what is the target audience :)
[16:20:06] <Emn1ty> Mostly their customers.
[16:20:29] <Schyzo> By the way, did someone already had an issue with the autocompleter with categories and the HTML rendering ?
[16:20:39] <Emn1ty> But if your client pulls up the site and says "Why isn't this working?" 4 times a week cause they are on old browsers what do you do?
[16:21:09] <Schyzo> I feel like the two _renderItem functions do not behave properly : http://jsfiddle.net/tReg7/2/
[16:21:31] <Schyzo> Emn1ty: you tell them to pay for a specific support
[16:21:53] <Schyzo> or you do it for free if you feel like you are going to lose a big customer
[16:21:55] <Emn1ty> Schyzo: not a part of our marketing, unfortunately :|
[16:22:17] <Schyzo> Emn1ty: yeah it all depends on the cases
[16:22:35] <Emn1ty> We are trying to be cheaper, better and more considerate of our clients. Right now there are maybe 4 other providers out there and they all ask way too much money and could care less about your content.
[16:23:21] <Emn1ty> Thousands for a template site, per month?
[16:24:47] <Bankzilla> do you know what browser they're using?
[16:24:49] <meanmor> Do I understand ajax async right? var json; $.ajax({ async: false, dataType: 'json', url: '...', success: function(data) { json = data } }); // json is now definitely set, even on slow networks
[16:24:58] <Bankzilla> could just help by telling them to update to a modern browser
[16:31:37] <brettfrable> what do you mac users use to test ie
[16:32:35] <Emn1ty> a pc
[16:32:40] <Bankzilla> ^this

[18:27:50] <dwr^> Im very new to jQuery and trying to make an animated menu for the first time... I figured out to use .animate(), but what would be the smartest way to make it respond with changing the size (all of them) the initial buttons to a lower height, when either of them is clicked?
[18:27:51] <Whirl3d> Good evenin all. Since you can register multiple callbacks on a deferred, would you just run them one after the other or can you pass an array of callback funcctions as one of the paramters of .then()?
[18:28:01] <dwr^> The code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/TfN5w/3/
[18:28:57] <dwr^> Initially the button height is 250px
[18:32:04] <innociv> you are using jsfiddle wrong
[18:32:04] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/TfN5w/8/
[18:33:04] <innociv> if you want to change size on click then put your animate in a .click()
[18:34:47] <Whirl3d> Are all of the callbacks resolved with the same target that a deferred is resolved with?
[18:34:49] <dwr^> I see :) Thanks! I'm trying to figure out what you changed... Did you only change the script in javascript?
[18:35:17] <innociv> You don't need <script> tags jsfiddle already adds that.
[18:35:56] <innociv> and i changed the height change to atually see a change
[18:36:54] <dwr^> I see... I just copied from my document. I'll work a bit more on it then!
[18:36:56] <dwr^> Thanks!
[18:37:11] <innociv> you probably want $('.menu_btn').click(function(e){ $('.menu_btn').animate(...); //make them all normal size  $(this).animate(...); //change the clicked ones height });
[18:38:59] <Whirl3d> or $(this).siblings().animate({height:shorter}, {duration:500});
[18:41:24] <dwr^> hehe... This siblings-snippet is beyond my skill so far, though I can sort of guess how it works...
[18:41:55] <dwr^> innociv >> what is the 'e' parameter referring to?
[18:44:30] <rhizmoe> does this look like it could work?   $('span.letterbox').delegate('input.letter','focusin',...
[18:44:57] <rhizmoe> it kind of looks wrong, but i can't put my finger on it
[18:45:14] <Whirl3d> what are you trying to delegate?
[18:47:48] <rhizmoe> it will be a css change. the span contains a bunch of text inputs, single character letter boxes. this is to highlight the enclosing span when one of its single-character text inputs has focus. exhale
[18:48:24] <rhizmoe> this.parent().css('background-color:lightgold') or whatever
[18:48:31] <Whirl3d> are you using 1.7?
[18:48:39] <rhizmoe> .1 i think
[18:48:44] <rhizmoe> 1.7.1
[18:48:54] <Whirl3d> As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method.
[18:49:37] <rhizmoe> oh! i'm sure my knowledge is 1.6 at the latest then
[18:49:40] <rhizmoe> thanks
[18:50:05] <Whirl3d> .on works great if you get the chance to try it
[18:50:17] <rhizmoe> and there it is at the top of the delegate() page behind this purple link
[18:51:37] <Whirl3d> so you would just do sometihg like $("parent").on("focusin", "input.letter", function (e) {$(this).css("backgroundColor","red");});
[18:51:38] <rhizmoe> if i hang that on the span will it catch all the focusin's of its children, or should i target the inputs and then find the parent?
[18:51:45] <rhizmoe> gotcha
[18:51:57] <rhizmoe> thanks
[18:52:07] <Whirl3d> I would suggest handling it at the parent element. That way it handles all of them.
[18:52:32] <Whirl3d> Plus, with .on as you add elements (for example), it'll manage the events for the new elements without any extra consideration.
[18:52:41] <rhizmoe> swank
[18:53:03] <uf0_work> how can I emulate a css hover with a toucht even on ipad or iphone?
[18:53:09] <uf0_work> touch event*
[18:53:51] <Whirl3d> check to see if you are using a touch-enabled device and trade the click event for the hover event?
[18:55:04] <rhizmoe> hm, the console.log on the on() isn't firing
[18:55:05] <Whirl3d> I think there are some touch-enabled plugins that might help.
[18:55:30] <Whirl3d> Check to see if focusin has special syntax...
[18:55:53] <Whirl3d> it might require focusin and focusout rather than focus and blur
[19:00:01] <Bankzilla> ?focusin

[19:02:00] <Parhs> hello guys.. is there a way for sortable table?
[19:07:21] <xp_prg2> I have this: var clsNames = $("#product_tree").dynatree('option', 'classNames');
[19:07:38] <xp_prg2> clsNames is undefined but when I don't try to assign I get an object with properties
[19:07:43] <xp_prg2> I am confused what I am doing wrong
[19:08:51] <Whirl3d> what do you mean when you dont try to assign
[19:09:01] <xp_prg2> $("#product_tree").dynatree('option', 'classNames');
[19:09:04] <xp_prg2> if I do just that
[19:09:21] <Whirl3d> okay, where do you get the object?
[19:09:31] <xp_prg2> well in the java console of chrome
[19:09:40] <xp_prg2> it shows an object
[19:09:45] <shoky> Whirl3d i didnt understand your question
[19:09:46] <Whirl3d> so dynatree simply creates, but doesn't return the object
[19:10:08] <xp_prg2> how do I make a naked object in javascript?
[19:10:21] <shoky> {} ?
[19:10:31] <hacks> How do I limit the distance of dragging for a draggable?
[19:10:52] <Whirl3d> using jquery UI or HTML5?
[19:11:07] <hacks> the distance that the draggable element can be dragged, not to be confused witht the distance option.
[19:11:18] <hacks> Whirl3d: jquery UI
[19:12:02] <xp_prg2> shoky your help has allowed me to become one with the universe
[19:12:16] <Whirl3d> you're probably going to have to poll mouse position during the drag event and calculate distance until it reaches your limit and then fire a callback...
[19:12:17] <shoky> run naked like your objects
[19:12:25] <xp_prg2> I shall
[19:13:52] <shoky> gnight
[19:14:11] <Whirl3d> gnight sir. Sleep well
[19:16:14] <species> the topic says no PMS
[19:16:17] <species> thats a bit sexist isnt it?
[19:17:09] <systemfault> Y U SO FUNNY‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. NOT?
[19:18:55] <hacks> Whirl3d: I don't want to call a callback, I want to constrain the drag operation
[19:19:55] <Whirl3d> obviously the callback would stop the drag
[19:20:31] <Whirl3d> or perhaps it could override the mousemove event once fired
[19:21:45] <Whirl3d> But there is probably a builtin method to handle what you want in the jQueryUI API. I just don't know it.
[19:22:08] <rhizmoe> dangit
[19:22:34] <Whirl3d> rhizmoe, make a fiddle...it'll be easier to figure out
[19:22:52] <zelrik> hi
[19:25:48] <hacks> Whirl3d: so I just return false within the drag event?
[19:26:25] <Whirl3d> Not sure how to stop the drag event. I'll look it up for you.
[19:27:24] <rhizmoe> Whirl3d: workin on it
[19:27:57] <zelrik> is .ajax the only solution if I want to process some json data returned when I submit a form?
[19:29:10] <Whirl3d> hacks, you might just want containment option
[19:29:38] <hacks> Whirl3d: I tried it, but I can't seem to get it to work
[19:30:18] <Whirl3d> hacks, you are gonna have to make a fiddle otherwise it's a crap shoot
[19:30:33] <hacks> Whirl3d: What should I set containment to?
[19:31:06] <hacks> hmm
[19:31:29] <Whirl3d> the bounds that you want to constain to
[19:33:02] <hacks> so like
[19:33:32] <hacks> x1 and y1 is the top-left point in the containment rectangle, and x2 and y2 are the bottom right?
[19:35:00] <Whirl3d> yes
[19:38:30] <hacks> Whirl3d: got it.
[19:38:40] <hacks> thanks

[19:45:23] <eggsby> why am I getting errors such as 'test not defined' when trying to use qunit?
[19:47:25] <eggsby> hmm, reorganizing the order the scripts are loaded in fixed it
[19:47:28] <eggsby> stupid race conditions -,-
[19:47:38] <Whirl3d> obviously you must think that we have the psychic crystal ball that you are missing yourself otherwise you would realize that we have no idea what your code looks like.
[19:48:07] <Whirl3d> 8) I'd like to borrow it whe n you are done, please...
[19:50:02] <eggsby> I wish I could use qunit with a dynamic script loader
[19:50:26] <eggsby> My app loads fine using yepnope because it loads in order, but qunit blows up if I try to throw it in that process
[19:51:56] <zelrik> can .ajax be used to upload files?
[19:55:40] <zelrik> Looks like not
[19:56:48] <Whirl3d> zeirik, you can either accept defeat or do the next best thing: ask google. It's up to you. I can't help cause I don't know.
[19:57:06] <zelrik> Whirl3d: I have been reading on Google for the past 2 horus
[19:57:08] <zelrik> thx
[19:58:14] <Whirl3d> Keep in mind nobody's getting paid here. No one owes you a reply. This is a great community of really generous helpful people. Try to be patient and maybe ask during the day (US Time) and I am sure there will be lots of folks that will help
[19:58:27] <zelrik> I know
[19:58:52] <zelrik> I am just tired I guess
[19:59:16] <greggies> is this what you mean? http://www.phpletter.com/Demo/AjaxFileUpload-Demo/
[20:00:21] <zelrik> hm yeah
[20:00:27] <zelrik> this is not .ajax though
[20:02:03] <zelrik> that s an extra library
[20:02:05] <Whirl3d> zeirik, and there is little more frustrating than 100000 of google answers that don't work or apply. Trust me I know
[20:03:03] <Whirl3d> I was just encouraging you to not give up. Keep combing through results (especially at StackOVerflow) and eventually someone will come online that can help.
[20:03:27] <zelrik> Whirl3d: I am a bit upset because I managed this with .submit earlier today, once I wanted to process the result it got a lot harder for some reason
[20:05:33] <Whirl3d> I'm not really clear on what you are trying to accomplish
[20:05:52] <zelrik> upload a file, get the directory into a json
[20:06:21] <zelrik> and process the json right away
[20:07:50] <greggies> i think it gets tricky maybe because ajax doesn't technically have access to the file system although usually you can still workaround that, like that demo uses a hidden frame
[20:09:32] <zelrik> I think I ll give up on keeping it simple and use that ajaxupload.js thing
[20:10:11] <zelrik> I should go to bed
[20:54:36] <Bankzilla> anyone know how to use momentjs?
[20:57:51] <raj> .get() returns a dom element, how can I instead get a jquery element returned?
[21:31:18] <macmartine> Is it common in a web application to hide/show divs with each pages content with jquery/js instead of re-fetching each time?
[21:32:12] <iamntz> macmartine: no, in fact it's faster to show, rather than fetch & show
[21:32:42] <iamntz> macmartine: the general idea is to reduce at minimum dom changes (which are the most expensive things, next to repaints)
[21:33:32] <macmartine> iamntz: wait, what? it's faster to hide one div and show another than to refetch and replace, agree?
[21:33:43] <iamntz> macmartine: yup
[21:34:18] <macmartine> right, so it IS common to hide the div for the current page, and show the div for another?
[21:34:35] <iamntz> yes :)
[21:34:43] <iamntz> sorry, it's morning here, i just woke up ^_^
[21:35:06] <iamntz> so yeah, it's common (and recommended) to show/hide stuff, rather than fetch
[21:35:16] <macmartine> ok. is there a name for that, or plugins that help with it? i have it working, but wanting to making it easier to maintain -- or basically just make sure it's designed as well as it can be
[21:36:14] <iamntz> el.show() and el.hide() isn't enough?
[21:37:11] <mawhtin> I'm using jQm's columns
[21:37:24] <mawhtin> but when i make the ui-grid-a colums, they aren't side by side
[21:37:30] <mawhtin> they're on top of one another
[21:37:37] <mawhtin> Any idea why?
[21:37:54] <iamntz> the plugin doesn't have a method for refreshing position?
[21:38:13] <mawhtin> actually not a plugin at all
[21:38:20] <mawhtin> it's just straight up copy and past from jQm's documentation
[21:38:24] <mawhtin> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-grids.html
[21:38:37] <mawhtin> but it doesn't show up left or right, as how they have it
[21:38:42] <mawhtin> just stacks on top of each other
[21:38:45] <iamntz> ah
[21:39:00] <mawhtin> it's killing me, because it's simple html‚Ä¶ yet the problem is nowhere to be found
[21:39:13] <iamntz> simple html AND css :)
[21:39:16] <iamntz> did you included css?
[21:39:23] <iamntz> the styles are applied correctly?
[21:39:32] <iamntz> the class names?
[21:39:48] <mawhtin> yup
[21:39:48] <iamntz> because you have to add certain classes, depending of the position
[21:39:59] <mawhtin> i included jQm, jQ, jQm's css
[21:40:50] <iamntz> what you see on inspector styles? does the elements have the right widths?
[21:40:52] <Edler> anyone here interested in giving me feedback about a plugin i just wrote ?
[21:40:57] <iamntz> Edler: shoot
[21:41:10] <aro> we have a submit payment form - is it better to submit the payment and details using ajax or a traditional POST?
[21:41:20] <mawhtin> well I didn't assign a width at all
[21:41:33] <mawhtin> I figured it's supposed to default to 50/50 split as the doc mentions
[21:41:37] <Edler> go here using chrome
[21:41:39] <Edler> http://bit.ly/JXSOgv
[21:41:47] <Edler> then click on any of the first 5 links in the menu
[21:41:52] <Edler> (the back button will work to)
[21:41:56] <Edler> give me your feedback about the effect
[21:42:10] <aro> i dont like the flash
[21:42:23] <aro> it would be nicer if it transitioned from the current state
[21:42:34] <aro> instead of resetting to a different color then transitioning from that
[21:42:36] <iamntz> mawhtin: that's the problem, you basically have to add a width for elements
[21:42:36] <aro> but thats just me
[21:42:42] <aro> @Edler
[21:42:47] <iamntz> Edler: pretty nice, but aro is right
[21:42:59] <mawhtin> I know, so I tried that too, but it still stacks on top
[21:43:05] <Edler> which flash ?
[21:43:13] <aro> when you click an element, it flashes white
[21:43:20] <aro> and then animates from that color to the final state
[21:43:29] <macmartine> iamntz: Well, no, there's more to it. Need to activate the currently selected menu item, deactivate the old one. And I have subnavigation in some pages which complicates it a bit
[21:43:32] <Edler> aro: are you talking to me of mawhtin ?
[21:43:37] <aro> you
[21:43:43] <iamntz> mawhtin: ok, that's weird, can you upload on jsfiddle or smth ?
[21:43:51] <Edler> aro: it doesn't flash over here :S
[21:43:52] <mawhtin> k
[21:43:59] <aro> what browser are you in?
[21:44:03] <Edler> chrome
[21:44:04] <aro> i think iamntz sees it too
[21:44:06] <aro> i am in chrome too
[21:44:14] <aro> ohhh
[21:44:15] <Edler> how does it flash ?
[21:44:20] <aro> which animation are you talking about
[21:44:26] <Edler> click only on the first 5 menu elements
[21:44:29] <Edler> not on any other link on the page
[21:44:32] <aro> ok
[21:44:37] <aro> thats what i am talking about
[21:44:42] <Edler> you'll have a bad animation on the other links since they point to #
[21:44:46] <Edler> only the first 5 point to an actual page
[21:44:50] <Edler> in that template
[21:45:13] <aro> im clicking on 'All about the university', 'Why you should study with us' etc
[21:45:24] <Edler> ah no these are wannabe links
[21:45:24] <Edler> :P
[21:45:25] <mawhtin> http://jsfiddle.net/mawhtin/F4Rzq/
[21:45:35] <Edler> just click on style demo/home/portfolio
[21:45:38] <Edler> and see the effect
[21:45:41] <mawhtin> i mean it's nothing special, i'm just trying to get started, but I can't even get moving haha
[21:45:42] <Edler> you can test with the back button too
[21:45:44] <aro> yeah thats pretty neat
[21:45:49] <mawhtin> iamntz: http://jsfiddle.net/mawhtin/F4Rzq/
[21:46:05] <iamntz> mawhtin: you HAVE to add a float and a width in order to align things properly
[21:46:09] <Edler> aro: note that the code is independant in the page, i'm trying to write my first jquery plugin
[21:46:17] <aro> but still... fix that flash
[21:46:17] <iamntz> mawhtin: lemme do a quick fix
[21:46:22] <Edler> aro: yes
[21:46:27] <mawhtin> ok, thanks iamntz :)
[21:46:37] <Edler> aro: because i only need to activate the effect on links that refer to physical pages on the same domain
[21:46:49] <Edler> aro: at the moment i am activating it on all <a> without parsing and checking out first
[21:47:24] <aro> why not just add a selector class that you use for 'relative path' files?
[21:47:26] <Edler> so you see how cool it is to transition from page to page using CSS3 3d Transforms
[21:47:53] <Edler> aro: i'm trying to write it to be independant from the site's code, so i could activate/deactivate it on my client's websites at will (and make them pay for it)
[21:48:18] <aro> ok
[21:48:40] <Edler> aro: but theorically i could, or i could simply parse the href and figure out for myself
[21:48:59] <aro> you could
[21:49:02] <Edler> aro: do you think a website that has that, is a better website than if it didn't ?
[21:49:48] <iamntz> mawhtin: check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/iamntz/F4Rzq/1/
[21:49:58] <iamntz> mawhtin: let me know if is smth unclear :)
[21:50:24] <mawhtin> ok i understand the css floating
[21:50:34] <mawhtin> but, isn't jQm supposed to float it automatically for me
[21:50:37] <mawhtin> as part of the framework
[21:50:55] <mawhtin> whenever it detects UI-Class-a and its sub parts
[21:51:21] <iamntz> well, my friend, that is something i have no idea :)
[21:51:27] <mawhtin> :(
[21:51:31] <mawhtin> thanks though :)
[21:51:53] <iamntz> but from what i see on their demo, the css is specified in jquery.mobile.css
[21:52:33] <tmerrill99s> anyone wanna lend a noob a hand with parsing an array for certain values?
[21:54:49] <iamntz> tmerrill99s: shoot
[21:54:57] <tmerrill99s> alright
[21:55:32] <tmerrill99s> whats the convention in here?
[21:55:36] <tmerrill99s> jsfiddle?
[21:55:40] <tmerrill99s> pastebin?
[21:55:51] <ngharo> ?paste
[21:55:52] <iamntz> jsfiddle is better, at least for me :)
[21:55:52] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:56:11] <tmerrill99s> great.....coming up.
[21:57:16] <mawhtin> iamntz
[21:57:23] <iamntz> mawhtin:
[21:57:31] <mawhtin> verdoc from phone gap just basically did the same thing i did
[21:57:38] <mawhtin> referenced the js scripts through CDN
[21:57:39] <mawhtin> worked
[21:58:00] <mawhtin> i think the js files straight from jQm, or css or whatever have typos or errors in them
[21:58:34] <tmerrill99s> well......damn.  might be easier to explain
[21:58:54] <tmerrill99s>        $('.cr-text').append(getSelectedTextFromRealSelectBox);
[21:59:05] <tmerrill99s> getSelectedTextFromRealSelectBox is an array
[21:59:23] <tmerrill99s> I'd like to split that array on the "-" char
[21:59:45] <tmerrill99s> and then take each individual word and append it to that ".cr-text" div
[21:59:59] <tmerrill99s> but append doesn't work that way
[22:00:07] <tmerrill99s> so now i'm bummed.
[22:00:13] <iamntz> yourArray.join('-') doesn't work?
[22:00:47] <tmerrill99s> well, i get this when i do the plain old append:  -Auto Dealers-Automotive Supplies
[22:00:56] <tmerrill99s> but "-Auto Dealers-Automotive Supplies"
[22:01:01] <tmerrill99s> ...is one big ass string
[22:01:16] <tmerrill99s> I need to split it into individual parts
[22:01:34] <iamntz> i'm affraid i don't get what you need :(
[22:02:19] <tmerrill99s>        $('.cr-text').append(myArray) outputs everything as one string
[22:03:02] <tmerrill99s> i'll put it on a single line so it's more readable in this box
[22:03:03] <tmerrill99s>        $('.cr-text').append(myArray)
[22:03:15] <tmerrill99s> $('.cr-text').append(myArray)
[22:05:47] <tmerrill99s> ok one last try:   http://pastebin.com/jTJdUiXm
[22:06:47] <tmerrill99s> iamntz, i posted it on pastebin (if you're still following)
[22:07:30] <tmerrill99s> anyone else wanna take a stab at something that is probably really, really simple
[22:07:33] <aro> is there a way to display a lightbox with a loading animation when a form is submitted?
[22:07:36] <tmerrill99s> but i'm tired and king of the noobs
[22:07:39] <aro> tmerrill99s: what is the problem
[22:07:44] <tmerrill99s> http://pastebin.com/jTJdUiXm
[22:07:47] <tmerrill99s> see green text
[22:08:01] <m0dmd> sup everybody
[22:08:03] <aro> yes
[22:08:15] <aro> use $.each()
[22:08:22] <aro> dude
[22:08:33] <aro> why do you have $(document).ready() inside $(function()
[22:08:41] <aro> no no no
[22:08:49] <tmerrill99s> it's drupal 7 namespace issu
[22:08:56] <aro> whaat
[22:09:02] <tmerrill99s> do you use drupal?
[22:09:13] <aro> id rather saw my foot off
[22:09:19] <tmerrill99s> it doesn't need the onload but i need it
[22:09:51] <tmerrill99s> aro,  what's the proper syntax for .each there then?
[22:09:52] <tmerrill99s>        $('.cr-text').append(getSelectedTextFromRealSelectBox);
[22:09:53] <tmerrill99s> ?
[22:10:41] <aro> hang on
[22:10:45] <aro> do you have a jsfiddle of it?
[22:11:23] <tmerrill99s> no, you need one?
[22:11:26] <aro> it helps
[22:11:30] <tw2113> one of the awesome parts about javascript in general, is the ability to fiddle it
[22:11:36] <tw2113> since it's all client side
[22:14:24] <aro> ne1 know if you can do that?
[22:33:14] <gpampara> Hi. I'm relatively new to web dev, but I have the situation where I have a set of input elements on a page. I'd like to know if a jquery selector could uniquely identify input x on row y. Is there something special that I need to add (like id attributes) ?
[22:34:34] <Krinkle> gpampara: If you have control over the html of the page, yes, I'd recommend you either give them a unique id attribute (unique for the entire page) - or give the <form> element an ID an use the name="" of the input element to get it (if there is only one of each name)
[22:34:56] <Krinkle> var $form = $('#id-of-my-form');
[22:35:17] <Krinkle> var $someInput = $form.find('input[name="thename"]');
[22:35:50] <tmerrill99s> aro, you still there?
[22:36:17] <gpampara> Krinkle: thanks :) I'd like this to be an element in a kind of "data grid" so I was struggling because the id thing doesn't scale if the number of rows is variable
[22:36:30] <beancurd> gpampara: <input class = "unique-identifier" ...
[22:36:40] <beancurd> class/id up to you.
[22:36:56] <tmerrill99s> anyone else wanna take a look at my pastebin?
[22:37:02] <gpampara> cool. thanks for the help
[22:37:10] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: link?
[22:37:14] <tmerrill99s> i need some help splitting an array into pieces and appending each one to a div
[22:37:16] <tmerrill99s> Krinkle,
[22:39:03] <tmerrill99s> http://jsfiddle.net/4vaWH/1/
[22:39:32] <tmerrill99s> the bit where it says "-Auto Dealers-Automotive Supplies-Auto Dealers-Automotive Supplies"
[22:39:37] <Krinkle> OK
[22:39:45] <tmerrill99s> I need each one of those split on the "-"
[22:39:52] <tmerrill99s> and put on their own respective line
[22:39:58] <tmerrill99s> maybe wrap it in a div i sppose
[22:40:27] <tmerrill99s> in the js.....the "magic" happens at the end
[22:40:39] <tmerrill99s> see my comment about "//How to get each individual...."
[22:42:54] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: reading
[22:43:10] <tmerrill99s> Krinkle, great!
[22:43:14] <tmerrill99s> thanks!
[22:44:47] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: (function ($) {  $(document).ready(function(){ ....  })   }(jQuery));  instead of that repeated several times do this:
[22:45:24] <Krinkle> (function ($) { ...  }(jQuery)); over the entire module, and for each document ready block you need   $(document).ready(function ($) { ....  });
[22:45:35] <Krinkle> Or if everything is in the same file, you can use the ready($) argument
[22:45:42] <Krinkle> jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { ....  });
[22:45:49] <Krinkle> so that $ is only local and use jQuery
[22:45:58] <tmerrill99s> thanks, but i really just need the array broken into pieces
[22:46:14] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: sure
[22:46:19] <tmerrill99s> i'm well aware that this ain't exactly optimal
[22:46:23] <blendedbychris> anyone care to recommend a slider that works with reactive design and can hold more than just an image?
[22:46:24] <Krinkle> so I assume this function runs when the user changes the value ?
[22:46:34] <tmerrill99s> yes
[22:46:36] <Krinkle> because right now it runs on document ready
[22:46:46] <tmerrill99s> well, the page retains a state
[22:46:55] <tmerrill99s> that is determined by what was selected
[22:47:09] <Krinkle> the selection can be changed on the page, right ?
[22:47:11] <tmerrill99s> yes
[22:47:59] <Krinkle> so it should run onchange , anyway, you'll figure that out later
[22:48:06] <Krinkle> so you're using :selected to get the selected items,
[22:48:09] <tmerrill99s> yes
[22:48:24] <tmerrill99s> i just want the text of those items and put them next to the green checkbox
[22:48:27] <Krinkle> Why does each item start with "-" ?
[22:48:35] <Krinkle> Use <optgroup> to group things
[22:48:38] <Krinkle> that looks terrrible
[22:48:42] <tmerrill99s> drupal spits out it's "parent" terms that way..........long, ugly story
[22:48:50] <Krinkle> drupal.. okay
[22:48:58] <tmerrill99s> technically, they aren't really parents
[22:49:11] <tmerrill99s> this is just a big fix to a deeper, darker problem.
[22:49:24] <tmerrill99s> you see why i mentioned "pride" in that pm? ;-)
[22:49:29] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: Okay, so aside from the green bubble, where else do you need the values ?
[22:49:39] <tmerrill99s> just at the green bubble, Krinkle
[22:49:45] <Krinkle> Okay
[22:50:45] <tmerrill99s> i have a sick baby right now and am apparently too tired to figure out how to split them on the '-' and then wrap them in a new div or append a '<br />' onto them.
[22:51:38] <tmerrill99s> I'm not too sure why it's doubling them now too.
[22:51:41] <tmerrill99s> -Auto Dealers-Automotive Supplies-Auto Dealers-Automotive Supplies
[22:51:46] <tmerrill99s> should just be one of each
[22:52:10] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: I got a hunch
[22:52:16] <tmerrill99s> oh oh
[22:53:40] <tmerrill99s>        $('.cr-text').append(getSelectedTextFromRealSelectBox).split("-")
[22:53:43] <tmerrill99s> doesn't get me there.
[22:53:44] <Krinkle> no
[22:54:15] <mgeary> hi folks
[22:54:30] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: There is another script on the page also inserting them
[22:54:35] <Krinkle> are you loading a .js file that also appends them ?
[22:55:15] <tmerrill99s> i don't think so.  actually, that's not so concerning as it's probably something silly like that.
[22:55:30] <tmerrill99s> it's really just breaking that big string apart
[22:55:41] <Krinkle> I mean, this is a jsfiddle, so in reality you have this in a file
[22:55:49] <tmerrill99s> yeah, it's all good there
[22:55:52] <tmerrill99s> well, almost
[22:55:55] <Krinkle> you need to comment that out in the HTML part so that your "old" one doesn't' run twice
[22:56:04] <tmerrill99s> yeah, will do
[22:56:08] <Krinkle> tell me which one of the <scripts>s so I don't have to figure it out
[22:56:20] <Krinkle> I have some changes in the jsfiddle
[22:56:34] <Krinkle> will post link once it works, tell me which one I need to disable in the mean time :)
[22:56:48] <tmerrill99s> you mean which js file?
[22:57:05] <tmerrill99s> man..........since this is drupal (a cms) it could be one of many
[22:57:09] <tmerrill99s> but that's beside the point
[22:57:18] <tmerrill99s> did you get that big string split a part?
[22:57:28] <tmerrill99s> cuz that's what i'm looking for.
[22:57:37] <Krinkle> No it is not
[22:57:39] <Krinkle> So suppose I make it work
[22:57:40] <Krinkle> Where are you going to put that script ?
[22:57:43] <tmerrill99s> [dies inside]
[22:57:47] <Krinkle> You need to put it somewhere that replaces the broken script that you had first
[22:58:09] <Krinkle> otherwise you'll have "-Auto Dealers-Automotive Supplies Auto Dealers, Automotive Supplies"
[22:58:28] <tmerrill99s> ok...i just looked at the real thing and it's not doubling up there
[22:58:28] <Krinkle> So which of the 20 <script> is the one you created and copied into the jsfiddle ?
[22:58:34] <Krinkle> obvously
[22:58:44] <Krinkle> because in the real one you only have your file and not your file + jsfiddle
[22:58:48] <blendedbychris> anyone care to recommend a slider that works with reactive design and can hold more than just an image? I am using anythingslider atm and it relies on a fixed height.
[22:58:49] <Krinkle> you copied part of it into the js fiddle editor
[22:58:51] <Krinkle> that one is running twice
[22:59:05] <tmerrill99s> hmmm.......lemme look
[23:00:41] <tmerrill99s> Krinkle, can we ignore that for now?
[23:00:47] <tmerrill99s> i noticed that it runs twice too
[23:00:58] <tmerrill99s> seems to be just in the fiddle thoug
[23:00:59] <tmerrill99s> h
[23:01:11] <Krinkle> Found it http://74.203.51.5/sites/all/themes/datasphere/js/coupon_recommendation_master_list.js?m3qj8s
[23:01:18] <tmerrill99s> yep
[23:01:20] <tmerrill99s> that's it
[23:01:28] <tmerrill99s> thought i took it out
[23:01:28] <Krinkle> That one is also running in the fiddle
[23:01:32] <tmerrill99s> yep
[23:01:34] <tmerrill99s> makes sense
[23:01:59] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: http://jsfiddle.net/4vaWH/4/
[23:02:23] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: also, if you can. drop the "type=text/javascript, text=text/css media=all" stuff in the html
[23:02:30] <Krinkle> completely redundant
[23:03:05] <tmerrill99s> huh, Krinkle
[23:03:33] <mgeary> why would i be getting this error after opening a dialog, closing it via the "x" button, and trying to open it again: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$("#format_popup").dialog('open')') ?
[23:03:50] <tmerrill99s> Krinkle, where can i append a '<br />' there?  to get them on their own line?
[23:04:12] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: the default media is "all", always has been (not a compatibility issue, so redundant). and text/css and text/javascript are ignored by the browser. the server defines the mime type. just <link rel=stylesheet> and <style> is needed
[23:04:43] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: If you use HTML, be sure to escape it properly or deal with html() only (don't mix .text() with .html() )
[23:05:12] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: http://jsfiddle.net/4vaWH/5/
[23:06:11] <tmerrill99s> yeah, great.  arrays are a kind of a pain in js, eh?
[23:07:14] <tmerrill99s> Krinkle, I'm gonna sign off but you, my friend, helped me greatly.  May your night be absolutely phenomenal!!!!
[23:07:37] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: thx :)
[23:07:49] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: I don't think arrays are a pain in js, they work better as in any other language I know
[23:08:28] <tmerrill99s> well, until I'm at the "Krinkle Level", I will continue to fine them painful.  ;-)
[23:08:32] <Krinkle> there only downside is that they are internally just hashes (objects), so they aren't optimized for numerical indices. But that also allows things like jQuery to work like arrays.
[23:08:36] <tmerrill99s> argh "find"
[23:09:08] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: No problem.
[23:09:21] <Krinkle> tmerrill99s: Are you currently also a programmer in other languages?
[23:09:55] <tmerrill99s> i do a bit of php
[23:10:15] <tmerrill99s> doing stuff in the front end seems so strange to me
[23:10:27] <tmerrill99s> like the rules are all over the place
[23:10:54] <tmerrill99s> on the back end a request is made, and that request gets served
[23:11:11] <tmerrill99s> on the front end, it's like Disneyland
[23:17:39] <aro> if i have an $.ajax() call inside a function, how can i make the main function return true when that ajax has a success?
[23:24:33] <zkirill> When I pass multiple deferreds to jQuery.when do they get executed serially or in parallel?
[23:32:40] <Angelos_> hi there guys, I have an issue with one of my pages and I need to resolve it. The LightBox 2 is not working in-conjuction with the style switcher.
[23:34:59] <joobie> hey guys.. how would i reference a "ul" with id "blah" using jquery?
[23:37:34] <jonnu> joobie: $('#blah')
[23:37:47] <jonnu> tag name doesn't matter if you have an id.
[23:37:49] <joobie> could i use $('ul#blah') ?
[23:38:04] <jonnu> yes, but it needless.
[23:38:12] <jonnu> because IDs are unique.
[23:38:12] <joobie> cheers
[23:38:18] <joobie> understand
[23:38:21] <joobie> thanks jonnu :)
[23:38:47] <Angelos_> google.load("jquery", "1.3.1");
[23:38:47] <Angelos_> google.setOnLoadCallback(function()
[23:38:55] <Angelos_> sorry
[23:38:56] <Angelos_> :(
[23:39:21] <Angelos_> Can somebody see http://www.pricklypearmedia.com/clients/vorelmedia/index_1.htm and let me know why the style switcher is not working with lightbox 2
[23:40:04] <aro> how come stopPropagation doesnt work with .on?
[23:40:57] <jonnu> Angelos_, probably a conflict between prototype.js and jQuery.  see: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[23:41:26] <Angelos_> where should the no conflict be put? In the prototype.js file?
[23:43:18] <Angelos_> i tried putting $.noConflict(); and it does not work
[23:43:54] <jonnu> Angelos_: '$' is probably used by a different lib.  in which case, you should have 'jQuery.noConflict();' instead.
[23:45:31] <blendedbychris> https://github.com/CaseyLeask/Dynamic-Carousel/blob/a59baac86df2555b379ebb9bc8a44e7308cc156d/plugin.js
[23:45:45] <blendedbychris> anyone take a peak at that and tell me how I can run "move" to goto frame 0?
[23:46:00] <Angelos_>  I am quite bad at jQuery. I've tried jQuery.noConflict prior to the code and it still does not work
[23:46:17] <blendedbychris> I tried $('carousel').move(0) and for whatever reason $slider.trigger('carouselmove', { moveTo: 0 }); moves t' frame 1
[23:53:26] <aro> how do i use stopPropagation on .on handlers?
