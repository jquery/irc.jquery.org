[00:00:12] <Nomikos> which, by the way, you can replace with "$(function(){"
[00:00:17] <Nomikos> (newer way)
[00:00:22] <phr> yeah, i've read about this
[00:00:43] <phr> but does that get executed/initialized from linked js file?
[00:00:55] <phr> or only when using it directly in a code?
[00:00:59] <Nomikos> yes, as long as the .js file is loaded /after/ jquery external js file
[00:01:11] <phr> because the fix which you provided, doesnt do anything
[00:01:14] <Nomikos> it's fine to have it in a seperate .js file
[00:01:22] <phr> hmm
[00:01:23] <Nomikos> then your problem is elsewhere :)
[00:01:30] <Nomikos> do you happen to have this live?
[00:01:48] <phr> wait a second. what do you mean as long as the .js is loaded after the external?
[00:02:02] <phr> do i need to have two? :o
[00:02:21] <Nomikos> phr: you have two external files usually, one with the jQuery library, one with your own custom code
[00:02:28] <phr> oh yes
[00:02:30] <phr> of course
[00:02:40] <Nomikos> the order they load is important
[00:03:01] <phr> awww holy shit, it works now!
[00:03:11] <phr> that was the catch
[00:03:12] <phr> :o
[00:03:14] <Nomikos> but if they were the wrong way around you should have gotten errors '$ not defined' or so
[00:03:17] <Nomikos> :-)
[00:03:48] <phr> i didn't really thought it makes a difference which one u use first
[00:04:15] <phr> it works great now, thank you Nomikos <3
[00:04:17] <phr> :)
[00:04:26] <Nomikos> yeah, html is pretty forgiving with a lot of stuff, but js is stricter :)
[00:04:30] <Nomikos> you're welcome
[00:05:02] <phr> i know that php is running stuff from beggining to the end, but i did not try to switch that js links around
[00:05:18] <phr> learned something new again :)
[00:05:22] <phr> smoke break;)
[00:05:33] <Nomikos> another thing you /can/ do in php but not in js is use functions before you've defined them
[00:07:00] <phr> Nomikos i see. i'm gonna take a deeper look into the documentation when i have a lil bit more time :)
[00:07:14] <phr> for now, i thank you for you info:)
[00:07:26] <phr> need a coffee and a smoke now ;
[00:07:58] <Nomikos> enjoy :)
[00:08:14] <Nomikos> (now I'm trying that function-order thing out and it /does/ work.. hrmph)
[00:15:06] <phr> re :)
[00:25:07] <Nomikos> on OS X, when hitting Cmd-arrow (any arrow), then releasing arrow key, then Cmd - keyup never triggers for the arrow key. Anyone know how to deal with /that/ ?
[00:28:23] <Cork> Nomikos: why do you need to track the cmd key?
[00:28:50] <Nomikos> Cork: yeah I don't really, so I guess I'll check for it and disable the regular action from happening
[00:29:16] <Nomikos> Cork: I was just testing out what keycombos would mess it up, turns out: Cmd :)
[00:29:34] <Cork> good to know
[00:35:28] <Nomikos> of course.. keeping down arrow key, then cmd, then releasing arrow key, still messes it up >.<
[00:48:47] <MichMich> Morning guys
[01:13:40] <Dustin> Hey there, is there a way to have a Modal box from an external html page with it's nested code?
[01:16:49] <jonkersjoe> Dustin : Iframe ?
[01:17:09] <jonkersjoe> as in modal box with an iframe in it ?
[01:18:09] <Dustin> jonkersjoe: No, say on my "home" page, I have a link "Login" I want to place the html structure in a "login.html" file, but on the home page, have someone click it and a modal box pops up, with the code from the login.html file
[01:20:13] <jonkersjoe> as much as I hate Iframes still have to suggest Iframe in a modal ?
[01:20:30] <Dustin> if it would have to be put in an iFrame, I would avoid it
[01:20:34] <Dustin> I hate iframes too
[01:20:46] <Dustin> was why I was asking if there was a way, which I'm requesting
[01:21:36] <jonkersjoe> otherwise use ajax to retrieve the structure and load it in the modal
[01:23:52] <jonkersjoe> Dustin: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[01:25:11] <Dustin> jonkersjoe: thank you
[01:27:43] <jonkersjoe> np

[01:30:44] <BinaryKitten> elements.hide().appendTo(target).fadeIn(0
[01:30:53] <BinaryKitten> *0=)
[01:31:20] <BinaryKitten> elements being a jQuery wrapped data

[01:41:50] <yassd> Hello
[01:41:57] <yassd> How can I stop an embed
[01:41:58] <yassd> with music
[01:42:01] <yassd> I have tried:
[01:42:02] <yassd> parent.$("#musicplayer").stop();
[01:46:02] <xec> yassd: what is this leading "parent." business?
[01:46:32] <yassd> because
[01:46:35] <yassd> it is in iframe
[01:46:55] <yassd> and the embed is out of the iframe
[01:47:14] <abletony84> At http://home.no/dwaynie/select2/ - how do I make the dropdown's tags into a's instead of li's, so that I'd have more styling power? I.e. I could add a width to the li's, and change their background on hover like http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/ask (without changing anything in the tags)
[01:49:22] <Cork> abletony84: no need to change the tag to get styling power
[01:49:30] <Cork> you can do anything you can do with a tags in li's
[01:49:34] <xec> yassd: you need to explain closer, maybe show a live url?
[01:50:15] <yassd> but the website isn't written with english
[01:50:41] <Cork> abletony84: just set tabstop="0" if you want the li to be able to get focus for example
[01:50:58] <xec> yassd: does it matter?
[01:51:07] <yassd> amm
[01:51:08] <yassd> maybe
[01:51:14] <Cork> abletony84: you should only use a tags if you actually want to provide a url link
[01:51:21] <yassd> I have
[01:51:23] <yassd> html
[01:51:29] <yassd> and in it I have
[01:51:30] <yassd> embed
[01:51:34] <yassd> wich play music
[01:51:36] <yassd> and after it
[01:51:40] <yassd> there is an iframe
[01:51:49] <xec> yassd: enter is not punctuation, keep your responses on one line please
[01:52:35] <abletony84> Cork: yeah but i mean like
[01:53:06] <yassd> ok, and the iframe contains the website itself, there is a button, which call to this parent.$("#musicplayer").stop();
[01:53:20] <abletony84> Cork: right now i have to style the li's as the tags themselves, it'd be cool if i somehow could style a's as the tags, so that i could do stuff outside of the tags on the li's
[01:53:33] <abletony84> Cork: like in http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/ask for instance
[01:54:15] <xec> yassd: what does the "parent" var contain?
[01:54:29] <yassd> nothing
[01:54:48] <yassd> it's call outside the iframe
[01:54:52] <yassd> i tought
[01:54:55] <Cork> abletony84: like i said you shouldn't be using a tags for that; though adding a span or similar would be fine
[01:55:30] <yassd> anyway forget the parent, I check in the console, and it's fine
[01:55:41] <yassd> it find the embed
[01:55:43] <Cork> abletony84: and you have an option formatResult that you can use to do what your after
[01:55:51] <yassd> but how can I stop the embed?
[01:55:58] <abletony84> Cork: oh yeah spans would do too
[01:56:00] <xec> yassd: what did you check, and what did you find? what is "the embed"?
[01:56:10] <abletony84> awesome man!
[01:56:20] <yassd> <embed id="musicplayer" src="<?php echo bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/sounds/song.mp3"
[01:57:02] <Cork> abletony84: theres also formatSelection, not sure what that does though
[01:58:08] <abletony84> cool
[01:58:14] <yassd> the embed works fine, but I have tried to stop him
[01:58:48] <yassd> <embed id="musicplayer" src="<?php echo bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/sounds/song.mp3" outostart="true" controller="false" volume="100" hidden="true">
[01:59:33] <Cork> yassd: that depends a bit on what plugin plays the mp3 file
[01:59:49] <Cork> but normally you can call something like .stop on it
[01:59:53] <yassd> no plugin I think
[02:00:01] <Cork> embed is always plugins
[02:00:06] <yassd> oh
[02:00:11] <yassd> but I haven't install any plugin
[02:00:18] <xec> i'm wondering if the browser just plays it
[02:00:20] <Nomikos> browser plugins, not jQuery
[02:00:20] <Cork> most systems have them by default
[02:00:24] <yassd> Yeh,
[02:00:28] <Cork> nope
[02:00:29] <yassd> it plays it
[02:00:37] <Cork> thats <audio>
[02:00:44] <xec> yassd: in any case, live url?
[02:01:25] <yassd> I'm not sure I'm allowed to
[02:01:37] <yassd> because it website for someone, not mine
[02:01:53] <yassd> so should I use <audio>?
[02:02:00] <xec> thats an option yes
[02:02:05] <yassd> ok
[02:02:05] <yassd> thanks
[02:02:16] <Cork> it demands newer browsers though
[02:02:24] <Cork> have that in mind
[02:02:37] <Cork> ie8 won't work for example
[02:03:17] <Cork> and opera and firefox doesn't support mp3 in audio tags
[02:03:32] <Cork> only wave and ogg
[02:09:46] <noregret> is using .on() better than https://github.com/brandonaaron/livequery ? i hear livequery is better than the core
[02:10:27] <yassd> it doesn't stop with audio
[02:13:14] <noregret> i'm using $('.spams.index').on('click', '#delALL',function(e){}) on http://pastie.org/4265021 and it is not getting binded in the future, what could be wrong ?
[02:19:21] <yassd> thanks
[02:19:23] <yassd> it works
[02:20:57] <Dustin> I have a question, say if I'm "templating" using PHP (include header, footer, menu) in the footer, I have a jquery snippet, is it ok / proper to add jQuery script to other pages, rather then include it in all pages? On my register page, it's made up of includes, under the "main" I will be putting a script include.
[02:25:38] <Browser> Hello
[02:30:04] <Browser> i have a <div><a></a><span class='aux'></span></div> , then $('a').click({....})  and i want to show the span when the user click in the A tag. The problem is that can be many spans with the same class.
[02:38:58] <khurram> give an incremental id attached to a class in a foreach loop Broswers
[02:39:09] * khurram looks like an IE to me
[02:40:18] <noregret> i'm using $('.spams.index').on('click', '#delALL',function(e){}) on http://pastie.org/4265021 and it is not getting binded in the future, what could be wrong ?
[02:42:25] <quicksilver> noregret: bound in the future? do you later add another element with id 'delALL' ? You can only have one element with a given ID...
[02:42:53] <noregret> quicksilver: an ajax request GETs the whole page
[02:43:01] <noregret> quicksilver: it is the same element
[02:43:54] <quicksilver> if it gets the WHOLE page, then it's replaceing the ".spams.index" part too
[02:43:59] <quicksilver> so you'll lose your handler
[02:44:18] <quicksilver> you could put the handler on the top level document object if you like.
[02:44:35] <abuayyoub> Hello, can someone help me please? I installed a plugin on my website a few days ago and it has been working fantastically, until today. I made a few changed to the CSS and it looked perfect. I then made a change in my wordpress page file and then the whole thing stopped working. If you take a look here http://www.boukay.com/stream you will see that the colums are all squished and small they should span the entire page. I contacted the developer and he 
[02:44:35] <abuayyoub> it was not a plugin problem but maybe a CSS problem. I spent several hours and even reverted back to the origional CSS file and its still not working. so someone said it might be a Jquery problem... CAn someone please help me out.
[02:50:20] <anew> http://pastebin.com/WUgtMuKJ any idea why console.log(item) works on line 6, but not on line 9 ?
[02:58:46] <mobilegamelabs> hi
[02:59:02] <abuayyoub> hello
[03:14:47] <noregret> i'm using stopPropagation() on an <a> and it is still going to href, why is that ?
[03:15:49] <KolakCC> noregret, I think you're supposed to use preventDefault
[03:17:41] <noregret> KolakCC: yeah right, i fixed it :)
[03:18:30] <Anticom> hi all
[03:18:31] <Anticom> i've got a question which is a little offtopic but realy bugging me: i somehow must have activated some weird debug mode from firebug's js-tab... now it's pausing the execution every few lines and i don't know how to get rid of it :/
[03:20:33] <bakert> anticom: sounds like you have a breakpoint â€¦ look for a filled circle to the left of the code it is stopping on.  double click to remove.
[03:20:52] <Anticom> bakert there isn't any
[03:21:04] <noregret> I have this html http://pastie.org/4265268 in a var, how can i extract the <table>...</table> from that ?
[03:21:18] <Anticom> when i'm triggering some events in my browser a yellow like "play" button appers where the breakpoints usually are displayed
[03:23:59] <noregret> can i use selectors in a certain set of html ? and not the whole page ?
[03:25:47] <Anticom> noregret $('table').html(); ?!?!
[03:26:16] <noregret> Anticom: that html is in a var
[03:26:23] <Anticom> so?
[03:26:27] <Anticom> what's your problem then?
[03:26:43] <noregret> Anticom: the one you're talking about is from teh whole page
[03:26:51] <noregret> that table selector applied to the document
[03:27:03] <noregret> i'm talking about html in a var, received from an ajax request
[03:27:26] <Anticom> huh?!
[03:27:28] <Anticom> i don't get it
[03:27:31] <noregret> so i'm asking if i can use selectors within that certain html, and not the document
[03:27:44] <noregret> Anticom: i sent an ajax request
[03:27:51] <Anticom> oh i think i got it
[03:27:55] <noregret> and got a response, a html response
[03:28:01] <Anticom> and got that html as string in a var and want to do operations on that?!
[03:28:09] <noregret> yep
[03:28:39] <noregret> i've seen $('selector', $(htmlstr)) on the internets
[03:28:48] <noregret> is that correct
[03:28:54] <Anticom> $('[selector]', theSuperAweseomeAjaxString);
[03:29:04] <noregret> aha, cool
[03:29:13] <Anticom> as far as i can remember at least :D
[03:29:31] <darrlhj> Hello everyone
[03:29:57] <darrlhj> I have a question about jquery position if anyone feels like helping me a moment?
[03:30:00] <Anticom> hoi darrlhj
[03:30:15] <Anticom> darrlhj never ask wether you get help... just.... ask your question :D
[03:30:24] <Anticom> someone will feel responsible
[03:30:26] <darrlhj> lol fair enough
[03:31:04] <darrlhj> well im using jquery mobile, and the jquery position plugin, all i want is an overlay to appear in the center of the viewport
[03:31:13] <Anticom> noregret here's a small (let's call it) guide on what to keep in mind: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/911718/jquery-selector-on-a-string-only-works-when-surrounded-by-a-div
[03:31:35] <noregret> thanks
[03:32:05] <Anticom> darrlhj any reason for not using old fashioned css to set up a div that is controlled by jq?
[03:32:13] <Anticom> you could do that yourself easily
[03:32:21] <darrlhj> i have it showing etc etc, but its relative to one of the containers, instead id like something like my: center at: center of: viewport
[03:33:20] <darrlhj> the page is quite long and scrolls, so id have thought id need JS to know what the viewport was
[03:33:42] <darrlhj> or else yes i could use css with an absolute position and left: 50% top: 50% or something
[03:33:55] <Anticom> darrlhj leftPadding (or x1 of your div) = (screenWidth - divWidth) / 2; AND x2 = x1 + divWidth
[03:34:05] <darrlhj> hmm
[03:34:11] <Anticom> that's all there is to
[03:35:22] <firekraag> Hi
[03:35:48] <Anticom> howdyhoe!
[03:35:49] <darrlhj> hmm
[03:35:58] <Anticom> um... is it only for me or is jsfiddle down?! :O
[03:36:47] <darrlhj> its down for me too
[03:37:05] <firekraag> I'm doing AJAX calls in a loop, and I need to pass the loop index to the success function (cause those calls are asynchronous and the index will have changed if I don't). Any ideas?
[03:38:30] <Anticom> add it to the object firekraag ...i can't see the magic in it tbh
[03:39:14] <Anticom> firekraag what kind of loop are you using? for-loop or $.each() ??
[03:41:22] <firekraag> for-loop
[03:41:23] <greek> Hi I have 3 tables side by side, I'd like to get their combined width so that I can evenly position something below, any tips? I know abut .css("width")
[03:42:16] <Patabugen> Hey! Is there something similar to $.ready which can wait for another external JS to be run?
[03:42:24] <Patabugen> E.g for a plugin to be ready
[03:42:35] <darrlhj> might be wiser to use a grid system...
[03:42:40] <Patabugen> Ideally I'd include the files in the correct order, but that's not possible at the moment
[03:43:03] <firekraag> Anticom: http://pastebin.com/AFLkUphB
[03:43:43] <Patabugen> $.ready({ script: 'other-file.js' }, function(){} ); would be cool. I've come across references to $.provide() but that doesn't seem to actually exist either.
[03:43:46] <firekraag> (target = table, copypasta error, not the cause of problem)
[03:43:46] <Anticom> firekraag http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[03:43:51] <jita> I have a row element, how can i select second td from it ?
[03:43:59] <jita> tr.td does not work
[03:44:24] <Anticom> Patabugen http://requirejs.org/
[03:44:37] <Anticom> this enables you to load external js files
[03:44:47] <firekraag> options is not a jQuery variable it's an array unserialized from a JSON response
[03:45:01] <Anticom> jita tr td:eq(1)
[03:46:48] <Anticom> oh man i think i'm going for a new record answering questions :D
[03:47:33] <firekraag> Anticom: Actually options is an array containing IDs, what I need to do is make one AJAX GET call per id, and insert each response in a table
[03:47:35] <jita> Anticom, $('.dynamic-form')[0].find("td .toggle_container")
[03:47:36] <jita> TypeError: Object #<HTMLTableRowElement> has no method 'find'
[03:47:50] <fraxinath> hi guys... quick question about http://paste.debian.net/hidden/cfcaca06/
[03:48:01] <Patabugen> thanks Anticom
[03:48:16] <peol> jita, you're taking the DOMElement out of its jQuery wrapper by doing [0], .find() is jQuery-specific, so drop the [0]
[03:48:17] <firekraag> Anticom: So for each ID in options, I create a dummy <tr> row containing a loading.gif icon, and when success is called I want to replace that <tr> with the response I just got
[03:48:19] <fraxinath> the dragging only works once, so apparently i am doing the re-binding of the mouseup function incorrectly
[03:48:54] <Anticom> jita remove the "[0]"-bit
[03:49:02] <jita> peol, but i have dom element, not the jquery one, suppose i have tr dom element, how can i find the second td of it ?
[03:49:39] <Anticom> firekraag then iterate over the returned json using .each() method
[03:49:41] <peol> jita, you're querying the DOM by doing $('.dynamic-form'), if you have the element, you'd do something likeâ€¦ $( myRefToADomElement ).find(...)
[03:50:46] <Anticom> jita i told you already $('tr').find('td:eq(1)'/*getting the 2nd td*/);
[03:53:11] <firekraag> Anticom: Thanks mate, I just love jQuery a bit more than before, if that's even possible
[03:53:32] <Anticom> the true awesomeness lies in it's plugins ;D
[03:53:37] <firekraag> The only thing that remains missing is $.coffee()
[03:53:46] <Anticom> oh and $.cookie();
[03:54:15] <Anticom> oh my bad
[03:54:25] <firekraag> What are your fav plugins? Mine are of course UI, and print
[03:56:20] <Anticom> there's a nice form serialization plugin (http://v3.javascriptmvc.com/docs/dom.html#&who=jQuery.fn.formParams) and ui-wise i love pines notify and dynatree
[04:02:09] <firekraag> The form serialization plugin looks nice, but I don't get the difference with the native serializeArray()
[04:03:39] <noregret> http://pastie.org/4265416 the request is successful, but nothing executed in the callback, why is that ?
[04:03:43] <Anticom> firekraag i think i had some issues with that one so i used this plugin and went fine
[04:05:13] <Anticom> noregret what is firebug console telling you?
[04:06:12] <tesserakt> I have a canvas tag with id="canvas". Why does $('#canvas').getContext('2d') not work? It appears I need to do $('#canvas')[0].getContext('2d'). Do I get an array returned? If so why?! Im getting element by id, there is only one element with a given id!
[04:06:33] <noregret> Anticom: the get request is 200 OK and i see the response
[04:06:45] <Anticom> and no error msg?
[04:06:50] <noregret> Anticom: and nothing is loogged by console.log
[04:06:53] <noregret> Anticom: nope
[04:07:34] <noregret> ah wait wait
[04:07:42] <noregret> the response isn't json, maybe that's why it failed
[04:08:10] <Anticom> and that's why i'm always using ajax :P
[04:08:19] <Anticom> i mean $.ajax()
[04:08:29] <noregret> fixed it :)
[04:12:20] <nFFF> tesserakt, getContext is a DOM element method, not a jQuery object method
[04:15:01] <jita> is there a way to disable all the events attached to the element ?
[04:17:21] <jonkersjoe> is jsfiddle down ?
[04:18:36] <Anticom> jep i think it is
[04:19:48] <jonkersjoe> drat
[04:19:50] <noregret> i have an element <a href=...>test</a> how can i remove teh anchor element while keeping 'test' ?
[04:20:53] <Anticom> $(myA).attr('href') = ''; isn't it?
[04:20:55] <Anticom> not so sure
[04:21:56] <noregret> Anticom: i want to remove the element, not change the href attrib
[04:22:27] <noregret> e.g. <div><a href=..>test</a></div> => <div>test</div>
[04:22:44] <Cork> Anticom: no, its .attr('href', '')
[04:22:50] <Cork> or removeAttr('href')
[04:23:34] <Cork> noregret: $(selector).each(function() { $(this).replaceWith($(this).html()); });
[04:24:47] <Patabugen> I'm struggling with requireJS, perhaps because I'm treating it similar to in Dojo. Can anyone suggest what I'm doing wrong here:
[04:24:48] <Patabugen> http://jsbin.com/igotim/3/edit
[04:25:04] <noregret> Cork: selector in this case should be 'a', rgiht ?
[04:25:29] <Cork> or what you want to select the element through ya
[04:26:02] <Patabugen> Anticom perhaps? :D
[04:27:47] <tesserakt> nFFF: ah, so what is the "jquery way" of getting the actual DOM element?
[04:30:44] <tesserakt> nFFF: or should I in that case rather do document.getElementByID('canvas')?
[04:33:39] <nFFF> ?get @ tesserakt
[04:33:39] <bot-t> tesserakt, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[04:34:05] <nFFF> but you can just use the standard array access $('.foo')[index]
[04:34:23] <Symbi0nt|GER> there was an alternate jquery I with tables and so forth, has someone the link?
[04:37:28] <tesserakt> nFFF: ah I see. thank you.
[04:43:02] <Anticom> Patabugen what exactly is the problem there?
[04:43:21] <Anticom> wow what a huge split :O
[04:44:10] <abuayyoub> antdillon: happened over a bunch of channels, the #javascript more than 300 split
[04:44:34] <pierpark> ha
[04:55:56] <MACscr> whats wrong with the syntax im using for the if statement on line 4? http://pastie.org/private/iw7lafhga1mbvaebkyaza
[04:56:18] <MACscr> says unexpected token { in console
[04:56:19] <johnkpaul> MACscr: you're forgetting function()
[04:56:42] <johnkpaul> on line 3
[04:57:29] <MACscr> johnkpaul: huh? thats on line 2
[04:57:45] <johnkpaul> yes, but you need it on line 3 as well
[04:57:54] <johnkpaul> $(form_name).validate(function(){
[04:58:00] <MACscr> oh!
[05:00:14] <goldstar> I am trying to do $(".el").click() on page load. This should load data in a certain tab but it is not. Anyone know why ?
[05:02:24] <johnkpaul> goldstar: is that in the .ready() handler?
[05:02:45] <goldstar> johnkpaul: yes
[05:03:02] <johnkpaul> .click() by tself doesn't load any data
[05:03:13] <johnkpaul> are you sure your handler is being called?
[05:03:27] <goldstar> johnkpaul: let me double check
[05:05:10] <goldstar> the handler for .el is further  down the page, although that too is wrapped in .ready()
[05:05:22] <goldstar> if I append it to an anchor it works fine
[05:05:34] <goldstar> if I do it on page load then it doesnt work
[05:05:45] <johnkpaul> what do you mean by "on page load"?
[05:05:47] <MACscr> jsfiddle down for you guys?
[05:07:26] <MACscr> johnkpaul: now i get unexpected string on line 7. I am starting to think the validate function isnt liking my use of an if statement for separating out the rules
[05:07:37] <MACscr> not really sure a better way to go about it though
[05:09:28] <goldstar> johnkpaul: when page has fully loaded, i.e. .ready()
[05:09:49] <johnkpaul> ah, MACscr, yes, that's not how validate wokrs
[05:10:00] <johnkpaul> you need to define your rules and messages before youcall the validate plugin
[05:10:08] <johnkpaul> validate takes an option, not a function, IIRC
[05:10:25] <johnkpaul> goldstar: are you sure that the elements with classname "el" exist when the dom is ready?
[05:12:55] <phr> guys, i need your help again. i'd like to dimm everything except the dialog box. how can i do that? thank you. http://jsfiddle.net/jXRYM/1/
[05:13:00] <goldstar> johnkpaul: it does exist in dom. The issue is U am using a jquery tabs plugin and maybe that is taking slightly longer to append an event handler to the .el element and hence it does not work. thoughts ?
[05:13:02] <MACscr> johnkpaul: well id rather not duplicate all that code just to remove a couple rules =/
[05:14:05] <MACscr> phr: work on your jsfiddle a little more =P
[05:14:11] <MACscr> did you even bother to try and test it out first?
[05:14:25] <MACscr> you didnt even select the jquery library
[05:14:40] <phr> MACscr ;) i've tried using fadein() and fadeout()..
[05:14:40] <johnkpaul> MACscr: you don't have to duplicate the code at all
[05:14:50] <johnkpaul> just define the objects before you pass them to .validate()
[05:15:00] <johnkpaul> this isn't a validate issue, this is just how the javascript language works
[05:15:23] <johnkpaul> {if(bool){'key','value'}} is not valid syntax in js
[05:15:54] <johnkpaul> you need something like if(bool){options = {key: 'value'}}
[05:17:03] <MACscr> johnkpaul: but it thought you said i couldnt even do an if statement within the validate function
[05:26:38] <jarco> Hello people, I was trying to use Jquery in a site already using mootools. I tried using jQuery noconflict but still I have problems when using Jquery. http://mijnkmosite-s1.be/boverte/ . I tried loading it before and after the mootools got loaded but still no luck.
[05:30:18] <johnkpaul> MACscr: yes, you cannot, I am teling you to do that before you call .validate()
[05:30:30] <johnkpaul> setup the options object before your current line 3
[05:31:19] <MACscr> johnkpaul: so how would i use the variable named "options" (if using your example) within the validate function in place of the expected rules/messages?
[05:37:58] <noregret> how can i select an elemnt and get its tags as well as its contents ?
[05:39:33] <Anticom> i don't know wether you noticed already noregret but there's a constant leak of precision in your questions :P
[05:41:11] <noregret> lol, i mean $(.div) in <div class=div><><><>..</div> will get inner stuff, without the original tag <div class=div></div>
[05:41:22] <noregret> well, i want to get the tags as well
[05:43:27] <Anticom> noregret http://jsfiddle.net/F79j3/
[05:43:44] <Anticom> or what?
[05:43:50] <Anticom> oh you meant the outer html?
[05:44:06] <Anticom> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419749/get-selected-elements-outer-html
[05:45:25] <noregret> Anticom: yes, outer
[05:45:52] <Anticom> see my last link noregret
[05:46:06] <noregret> yeah, thans
[05:48:57] <jita> how do i create new select with jquery ?
[05:49:04] <johnkpaul> MACscr: $().validate(options)
[05:49:51] <Anticom> jita a "new select"?
[05:50:01] <Cork> $('<select>') ?
[05:50:25] <Anticom> [...].append('<select></select>'); *
[05:50:38] <Anticom> :)
[05:51:49] <Trudko> guys does jquery have method for finding out number of elements in array?
[05:52:02] <Trudko> I know that length does not return what is expected
[05:52:10] <Cork> .length
[05:52:27] <Cork> thats the number of element that your selector matched
[05:52:46] <Cork> $('a').length is the number of a tags on the page
[05:52:49] <Cork> and so on
[05:54:19] <MACscr> johnkpaul: lol. Im completely lost. Im not even really sure how to make the options object. Your example is a bit to simple for my use and from your $().validate(options) example, i would have to pretty much move everything to that new object versus just the rules/messages as i had originally planned
[05:55:03] <johnkpaul> MACscr: yeah, I'm sorry, I made some assumptions about what your background was
[05:55:17] <MACscr> my background is php =P
[05:55:21] <johnkpaul> I think that it would be useful for you to learn about javascript objects, and the language a little more
[05:55:27] <johnkpaul> ?learn @MACscr
[05:55:27] <bot-t> MACscr, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[05:55:45] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn object literal @ MACscr
[05:55:47] <bot-t> MACscr, Working with objects - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects
[05:55:56] <MACscr> lol, i might as well save myself a few days of learning and just duplicate the code then =/
[05:56:23] <MACscr> time is not something i have on my side with projects right now
[05:56:58] <Trudko> Cork: but length return max index not number of elements -> http://jsfiddle.net/XFP2F/
[05:57:17] <Cork> uh...
[05:57:32] <Cork> ya, cause your array will contain 3 positions
[05:57:47] <johnkpaul> MACscr: we never have time on our sides AFAIK, but we still need to learn eventually
[05:57:56] <Cork> Trudko: arr[2] = val will generate arr = [undefined, undefined, val]
[05:58:19] <Cork> Trudko: its an array after all
[05:58:24] <Trudko> Cork: yes thats the thing but maybe I am too paranoid here
[05:58:35] <Trudko> and clients using my code won't do that
[05:58:44] <RudwolfBlack> guys
[05:58:55] <RudwolfBlack> I am trying to do an ajax scroll loader
[05:58:58] <Cork> Trudko: that means it doesn't return the max value, it returns how many positions there really is in the array
[05:59:07] <RudwolfBlack> but horizontally and moving forward and backward
[05:59:19] <RudwolfBlack> I have the following code

[05:59:20] <RudwolfBlack> x7x Let's rock! ;)
[05:59:23] <RudwolfBlack> ops
[05:59:24] <RudwolfBlack> sorry
[05:59:25] <Cork> Trudko: you should never do arr[2] = val to create array positions
[05:59:34] <RudwolfBlack> here
[05:59:35] <RudwolfBlack> http://jsfiddle.net/rudwolfblack/TpktN/
[05:59:36] <Cork> use .push and .pop
[05:59:41] <Cork> Trudko: ^
[05:59:50] <RudwolfBlack> the problem is, it moves forward with the sr() function
[06:00:01] <Anticom> Cork no, use google :D
[06:00:04] <RudwolfBlack> but back, with the sl() function it loads twice
[06:00:06] <Trudko> Cork: True true, as  I said i think I am just paranoid and client using my code wont do that. btw is there anything special about jquery lenght or can I use just array.length
[06:00:15] <RudwolfBlack> can someone take a look?
[06:00:35] <Cork> Trudko: .length IS Array.prototype.length
[06:00:40] <Cork> its the exact same thing
[06:01:16] <Cork> Trudko: so if what you have is an array, no need pushing it through jquery
[06:01:33] <Trudko> Cork: ok great
[06:02:18] <Trudko> Cork and last thing i have method and I want to check arguments of that method and tell client if something is wrong , what's common way how to do that in javascript? In java I throw expcetion
[06:02:47] <Cork> Trudko: exceptions work
[06:02:58] <Cork> or you could gracefully handle it by defaults
[06:03:02] <Cork> thats more common
[06:03:33] <Cork> js normally just expect you to give it correct value, and then just crash later if you didn't
[06:04:01] <Cork> kinda a rtfm way of handling it
[06:04:36] <Trudko> Cork: would not work for me I guess I ha ve method with two params 1. id of some select 2. array with values. My method takes those values and set them as option text of select. So number of elements in array have to be same as number of options in select.
[06:05:23] <Cork> you could just set them to empty string if they don't match
[06:05:33] <Cork> or just skip the tailing string if theres too many
[06:05:46] <Trudko> Cork: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/wPYrL/5/ but if i have less values in array empty value is set which is bad imho because client does not know it unless he checks dropdown
[06:06:08] <Trudko> and imho client should know as as possible if there is something wrong
[06:06:10] <noregret> can someone help with http://pastie.org/4265917 please
[06:06:52] <Cork> Trudko: why don't you just wipe the select box and create option elements from the array?
[06:07:55] <Cork> $('#'+ dropId).append('<option value="' + index + '">' + arrayWithValues[index] + '</option>'); kinda thing
[06:08:12] <Cork> anyway gtg
[06:08:50] <Trudko> Cork it is worth it? seems like bit slower(maybe it is not problem).
[06:09:08] <Cork> Trudko: its a tiny bit slower, but you get a stabler code
[06:09:44] <Famic> what's the best approach to detect user-agent ?
[06:09:46] <Trudko> Cork good point I still I will pas because what I am actually doing is translation and creating elements for client seems bit out of scope if you know what I mean
[06:10:01] <Cork> Famic: don't do feature detection instead
[06:10:26] <pachet> Famic: why do you need to detect user agent
[06:10:30] <Famic> Cork: I am using modernizr. But it says webOS does support fontface when it doesn't, so I still need user-agent detection
[06:10:34] <Cork> Trudko: if thats the case i would go with an object instead
[06:10:49] <Cork> Trudko: and have the original text as key, and the translation as value instead
[06:10:52] <Trudko>  Cork what do you mean(btw sorry I knwo you are on the way)
[06:11:33] <Trudko> cork so set default value for element take that value and simply replace it with translation
[06:11:45] <Cork> translation = { 'org value': 'new value' } $('select option').each(function() { $(this).text(translation[$(this).text()]) });
[06:12:15] <Cork> Trudko: then you could implement a translation function that if its not in the object, returns the original text
[06:12:30] <Cork> that way you never destroys anything
[06:12:49] <pachet> preferably saving $(this) to a variable within that inner scope ;p
[06:13:02] <Cork> Famic: check if you can set the font face instead
[06:13:02] <Trudko> Cork: yes seems more ,,sexy"right now I am actually seting all values for elements by hand so for each element there is extra line of code which sets the value
[06:13:30] <Famic> Cork: isn't that what modernizr does ?
[06:13:47] <Famic> I think webos browser is just bogus
[06:14:09] <Cork> Famic: if so then you wouldn't need to use ua sniffing
[06:14:25] <Cork> you could do something like if($.browser.support.fontface)
[06:14:50] <Cork> i'm extending $.browser.support my self
[06:15:04] <Cork> its really the best way to handle things like that
[06:15:14] <Cork> cause you don't have to constantly update the list
[06:15:23] <Famic> $.browser.support is undefined
[06:15:32] <Cork> ?.support
[06:15:33] <bot-t> jQuery.support: A collection of properties that represent the presence of different browser features or bugs. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[06:15:34] <silverwind> He should use modernizr, no?
[06:15:35] <Cork> opps
[06:15:41] <Cork> its directly on jquery. not in browser
[06:15:56] <Famic> silverwind: I am. read above
[06:16:02] <silverwind> And if he has a false positive.. then he should write a modernizr test that makes it fail
[06:17:00] <Famic> silverwind: there was a ticket for that in modernizr, they replied it couldn't be done and a comment in the doc was enough
[06:17:21] <Famic> Cork: console.log($.support.fontface); -> undefined in ff
[06:18:06] <Famic> even though it supports it
[06:18:34] <silverwind> o_O
[06:18:42] <noregret> can someone help with http://pastie.org/4265917 please
[06:18:49] <silverwind> Famic, he said he wrote the test himself...
[06:20:07] <Famic> silverwind: and if the modernizr team says testing for fontface support in webos can't be done I trust them... So I need to resort to ua sniffing
[06:20:14] <hooloovoo> noregret: $("body").on("click", '.spams.index .paging', function() { //code });
[06:20:19] <Famic> so... what's the best approach to detect user-agent ?
[06:20:33] <hooloovoo> noregret: that will bind the event to body so that your event will still trigger even if it's removed or added.
[06:20:55] <silverwind> Famic, you misunderstood me, I said that $.browser.support.fontface doesn't exists because Cork implemented it himself and it's not part of jQuery
[06:21:28] <Famic> silverwind: I get it. But I doubt his test would give pertinent results with webOS
[06:21:29] <noregret> hooloovoo: you mean $("body").on("click", '.spams.index .paging a', function() {
[06:21:38] <noregret> hooloovoo: since i'm binding it to an anchor
[06:21:43] <Famic> noregret: http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html#tldr
[06:22:34] <hooloovoo> noregret: yea, that would work.
[06:23:07] <noregret> cool, thanks :)

[06:28:32] <vl1234> $('input[name=txt1]').attr('disabled','disabled')
[06:28:53] <vl1234> its workin fine but that field is enable
[06:29:18] <vl1234> we can modify the values
[06:29:27] <vl1234> how to control that one

[06:30:57] <wroathe> Anyone here have experience with setting up colorbox?
[06:31:08] <firekraag> vl1234: You mean the attribute disabled="disabled" is added as expected, but the field does not get disabled?
[06:32:19] <vl1234> look wise field is disabled but am set and get values dynamicly ..that time its creating problem
[06:32:55] <vl1234> only we cant enter the values and modify..........thats it

[06:39:08] <pachet> noregret: either bind to those checkboxes explicitly when you add them, or delegate that event
[06:39:11] <jonkersjoe> noregret: you need to set up .on as a degelegate

[06:52:01] <noregret> hooloovoo: i'm already using .on()

[07:27:56] <entrada> ezioa: you should clean up the event handlers bound to it before removing the element
[07:28:35] <ezioa> entrada, really?  .. that's rough.
[07:28:41] <pachet> if you've bound them with jquery, then .remove() on the element will do all that for you
[07:28:58] <ezioa> ok
[07:29:18] <ezioa> what if i .remove on an outer element?
[07:29:36] <entrada> it recurses
[07:29:45] <ezioa> coo
[07:30:18] <entrada> ezioa: if you want to remove the element without removing the event handlers use detach()
[07:34:08] <DeltaHeavy> I have a bunch of elements with classes and no id's and I can't give them id's (at least easily enough to make it worth while). Is there any way to loop through a bunch of classes and treat each element individually?
[07:34:47] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: $('.class1, .class2, .class3').each(..
[07:35:00] <DeltaHeavy> I want to make the height of class 'a' equal the height of class 'b' for each instance of class 'a' and 'b'. Class 'b' is a different height every time.
[07:35:16] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: The each method would work for this?
[07:35:41] <shoky> you mean to change the height of all elements with class 'a' ?
[07:36:05] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Change all class 'a's to the height of their respective class 'b's
[07:36:13] <shoky> that doesn't make any sense
[07:36:25] <shoky> classes are static for the most part
[07:36:29] <shoky> you dont change classes
[07:36:35] <entrada> yeah i get it
[07:36:44] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: There's no set height on the CSS, but the height is different depending on the content inside of it.
[07:36:51] <entrada> DeltaHeavy: any chance no. of classA = no. of classB?
[07:37:01] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: what exactly do you want to do :\
[07:37:16] <DeltaHeavy> entranda: I'm unsure of what you're saying
[07:37:16] <shoky> dont say 'change the class's height' again
[07:37:43] <entrada> Are the number of classA elements and classB elements same?
[07:37:45] <shoky> also what does 'respective' mean
[07:38:18] <entrada> DeltaHeavy: if so, use the .index() method inside the .each() iterator
[07:38:25] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Each row has class 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' lets say. Each class is a column. The column of class 'a' has content in it that can alter the height of this column. I want all other columns to match the height of the column of class 'a'.
[07:38:27] <entrada> to get the corresponding element of the other class
[07:38:53] <entrada> DeltaHeavy: use the parent selector?
[07:38:58] <shoky> each class is a column?
[07:39:02] <DeltaHeavy> entranda: Also has no id's
[07:39:10] <shoky> you mean , all the cells in each column share a class ?
[07:39:13] <entrada> DeltaHeavy:  some code to follow
[07:39:32] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: No, each cell has it's own class. There are multiple instances of this table what's 1 row and 5 or so columns
[07:39:38] <shoky> also wtf is a height of a column?
[07:39:52] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: The height of the <div>
[07:40:06] <pachet> shoky: infinity
[07:40:09] <pachet> !
[07:40:11] <shoky> ;D
[07:40:48] <entrada> $('.a').each(function(){
[07:40:49] <entrada>    var $parent = $(this).parent;
[07:40:50] <entrada>    var currentHeight = $(this).height();
[07:40:50] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: still no idea what you want
[07:40:51] <entrada>    $('.b, .c, .d', $parent).height(currentHeight);
[07:40:52] <entrada> });
[07:40:55] <entrada> DeltaHeavy:  is this okay?
[07:41:09] <DeltaHeavy> entrada: I'm not sure but I think so
[07:41:09] <pachet> ?paste @ entrada
[07:41:10] <bot-t> entrada, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:41:19] <entrada> ah yes
[07:41:23] <entrada> thanks pachet
[07:42:30] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: There are 5 classes that are assigned to 5 different divs that are lined up horizontally. There are other sets of these 5 divs below it in a table-like manner. I want the height of the div on the far left to set the height of the divs to the right of it.
[07:43:22] <entrada> yeah DeltaHeavy this is exactly what the code does
[07:44:34] <DeltaHeavy> entrada: Thank you very much =D
[07:44:35] <eip56> so creating an object oriented script setup through a object literal instead of a true declaration such as var ob  = new object(); is that considered bad practice
[07:44:35] <shoky> does entrada's code work for you?
[07:44:37] <shoky> cool
[07:45:11] <shoky> eip56: var ob = new Object();  is fine practice ... you could also do var ob = {};
[07:45:46] <shoky> tho no idea what you mean by 'true declaration'
[07:45:48] <shoky> oh
[07:45:57] <shoky> ob = new Object()  <-- true declaration?
[07:46:08] <silverwind> Nobody uses "new Object()" :P
[07:46:11] <entrada> DeltaHeavy: you're welcome!
[07:46:19] <shoky> silverwind some do :P
[07:46:21] <shoky> (not me)
[07:46:51] <entrada> eip56: i prefer var obj = {}, its simpler
[07:47:07] <eip56> shoky i sleep very little you must not sleep at all ;-p how are you man? and i do declare var obj ={} just didnt not if that was acceptable
[07:47:17] <shoky> wat
[07:47:17] <b-ot> Superb document! There can under no circumstances at any time happen to get plenty of articles like as this primarily simply because any person should really understand what they're going to talk with reference toâ€¦

[07:49:11] <jonkersjoe> oh right
[07:50:05] <DarsVaeda> for getting the selected value of a select list what to use? "$(LIST).val()" or "$('option:selected', LIST).val()" ?
[07:50:19] <Asone> que la licorne invisible soit avec vous
[07:50:21] <anli_> Is it possible to add templates to ckeditor using urls instead of html for templates?

[08:04:45] <nvictor> hi all
[08:05:13] <nvictor> has anyone ever attempted to capture input from an ipad/ipod using jquery?
[08:05:44] <jedimind> capture how
[08:05:56] <jedimind> and they're not different inputs than any other device
[08:06:20] <nvictor> jedimind: like when a form field has focus, on focus out, i need to get the value entered
[08:06:48] <jedimind> that works exactly the same way you should not have to do anything specific to ios
[08:07:02] <entrada> nvictor: change() and blur() don't work?
[08:07:09] <nvictor> jedimind: well, it isn't working... :/
[08:07:12] <nvictor> entrada: no
[08:07:28] <jedimind> url?
[08:07:56] <nvictor> well i don't have the code online, but let me set something up in jsfiddle
[08:16:10] <nvictor> entrada, jedimind: no ain't that strange, the sample worked http://jsfiddle.net/kHbzx/
[08:16:20] <nvictor> hmm...
[08:17:06] <entrada> nvictor: happens :)
[08:17:43] <nvictor> oh yes!
[08:17:51] <nvictor> i am using a code for detecting mobile browsers
[08:17:53] <nvictor> let me add that
[08:18:36] <jedimind> nvictor, its always good to isolate your case - it helps you work out what might be interfering with it
[08:18:48] <jedimind> what is your mobile detection doing? and why do you have it to begin with?
[08:19:08] <entrada> nvictor: is it modernizer?
[08:21:10] <nvictor> entrada, no something i found online
[08:21:33] <entrada> *is suspicious*
[08:22:53] <jeredepp_> hello i got a website wich call a php script over ajax(jquery), this script has a shell_exec in it, and i get an ajax timeout, am i just using the wrong method (in your eyes) and how would you achieve it. Script needs around 10 minutes to run. i allready tried to pass "timeout:1800000" in the ajax call
[08:23:11] <silverwind> lol
[08:23:14] <silverwind> Haha
[08:23:34] <jedimind> if it needs 10 minutes to execute, i wouldnt use ajax
[08:23:45] <silverwind> To do that properly, you need to understand HTTP (REST)
[08:23:49] <jedimind> also wtf is it doing? computing PI to 203958209358 didgits ?
[08:24:08] <pachet> microwaving a lasagna
[08:24:55] <nvictor> there ya go: http://jsfiddle.net/kHbzx/3/
[08:24:55] <nvictor> that code is failing :/
[08:24:55] <nvictor> looks like it's doing the right thing though...
[08:24:56] <nvictor> typo!!
[08:25:00] <jeredepp_> jedimind: young padawan there a re scripts which import and parses several stuff, so there's no need to compute PI to take a script running that long :)
[08:25:13] <silverwind> jeredepp_, You "POST" at some url, then it returns right away with a Location header containing a URL to poll
[08:25:37] <nvictor> works! :)
[08:25:37] <nvictor> thanks guys
[08:25:37] <nvictor> o/
[08:25:38] <entrada> jeredepp_: long poll/ajax push
[08:25:40] <Vali> hi, I have a problem with buttonsets in IE7 (icon next to the date picker), it first renders in input 1 px lower than it should, and after I hover it the first time it moves up 1px (where it should be), does anyone have any idea why this is?
[08:25:45] <silverwind> jeredepp_, Then you poll that url.. every X seconds/minute, get the status
[08:26:09] <jeredepp_> silverwind, entrada: thanks #php also suggested this, i'll check it out
[08:26:31] <entrada> jeredepp_: have fun!
[08:26:49] <silverwind> Really? Whoa, jeredepp_ got a good advice from a PHP channel

[08:37:46] <light_dark> I wrote a very simple javascript to test dynamite captcha . But over 2 hours checking, I failed , frustrating. My idear is to change 'src' of 'img' label to get new captcha image. My code is: http://pastebin.com/bdcLkqMz   .Can someone take a look to help me, thanks.
[08:39:22] <entrada> light_dark: ah-ha
[08:39:36] <light_dark> because console didn't log the message, so i guess the "click" event is not triggerd
[08:39:42] <entrada> light_dark: $('#id_img').attr('src', 'http://127.0.0.1:8887/captcha');
[08:39:54] <entrada> light_dark: thats how you set an attribute
[08:40:03] <entrada> not $(..).src =
[08:40:37] <entrada> ?g attr() jquery doc
[08:40:39] <bot-t> entrada, .attr() – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[08:41:06] <light_dark> take a look at the second "click" script, it doesn't work either.
[08:41:38] <entrada> light_dark i just pasted this from there
[08:41:55] <motmot> ( src are comments )
[08:42:19] <entrada> motmot: oh yeah :D
[08:42:23] <entrada> didn't see that
[08:42:43] <light_dark> the console does not log the message
[08:42:59] <light_dark> so, the event is not triggered, i think
[08:43:18] <motmot> not an expert but
[08:43:27] <motmot> line 9 is weird
[08:43:29] <motmot>  $('#id_img').on('click', function(){
[08:43:41] <motmot> .on('click' ?
[08:43:53] <entrada> the error is line 13, i think
[08:43:55] <entrada> its not this
[08:43:58] <entrada> its $(this)
[08:43:58] <motmot> ok
[08:44:28] <motmot> true ...
[08:44:59] <light_dark> tried $(this), failed too
[08:45:44] <motmot> sorry but i still think line 9 is weird
[08:46:22] <entrada> motmot: i think you're right
[08:46:34] <entrada> the on syntax is different
[08:46:44] <entrada> um
[08:47:02] <motmot> yeah
[08:47:19] <motmot> it should be $('#id_img').click(function(){
[08:47:40] <entrada> nah the on syntax is right
[08:47:45] <light_dark> ok, I delete the first .on('click') script, then re-try. failed too
[08:48:05] <motmot> -.-
[08:48:40] <entrada> light_dark: paste bin, please
[08:48:46] <entrada> ?paste @light_dark
[08:48:46] <bot-t> light_dark, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[08:51:59] <djang0nub> im trying to get some properties of every select element and some properties of the options of that element using jquery. the properties of the options arent being printed correctly. could someone take a look?

[08:55:26] <sebi> Hi guys :) I'm quite new to jQuery and I am struggling with a problem. Could somebody have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/AgmRn/ and tell me why I get the alert only on the very first 'Lorem', but not on later #sideelement-s ? Any help is appreciated :)
[08:55:28] <cviebrock> seems to run on all changes
[08:56:31] <jonkersjoe> sebi: you have the same id
[08:56:37] <jonkersjoe> for all your elements
[08:56:57] <sebi> Yes, because I want to get the alert on every element.
[08:57:46] <djang0nub> anyone know whats happening here? http://fixee.org/paste/fdohkts/#url=c10ncyu. the last element in the array (the options) arent correct
[08:57:59] <jonkersjoe> sebi: use a class : http://jsfiddle.net/AgmRn/2/
[08:58:43] <sebi> jonkersjoe: are they always handled differently?
[08:58:55] <sebi> jonkersjoe: btw thank you for your help :)
[09:00:37] <jonkersjoe> sebi : yeah, if there are duplicates it will only pick up the first element
[09:01:06] <jonkersjoe> but generally you should keep your ids unique
[09:01:25] <jonkersjoe> use class to group items together
[09:01:25] <sebi> jonkersjoe: Alright, I'll try to keep that in mind! Thanks again :)
[09:01:32] <jonkersjoe> np

[09:07:04] <entrada> Famic: use uncompressed jquery
[09:07:14] <gus_> is that a copy and paste?
[09:07:19] <gus_> if so, you're missing a single quote
[09:07:19] <Famic> entrada: why ?
[09:07:31] <majd> hey #jquery - i'm trying to build an array from the input to a form to pass to my server - the array should be of the form {'value1': 1, 'value2': 2}
[09:07:34] <Famic> gus_: no, I missed it myself ;)
[09:07:37] <entrada> Famic:  it'll tell you what e and h are
[09:07:48] <Famic> k
[09:08:07] <majd> i tried ($'my_form').serialize(), but it does not give me the object i want
[09:08:09] <SeanJM> I'm using $.load and the output has a lot of /n's and more related / -- anyone ever experience this?
[09:08:38] <Famic> entrada: "TypeError: elem[type] is not a function"... not very helpful I'd say
[09:09:14] <entrada> majd: serializeArray()
[09:09:54] <SeanJM> majd: you mean $(my_form) right?
[09:10:06] <entrada> Famic: better than e and hâ€¦ fiddle it, let #jquery take a look
[09:10:23] <majd> entrada: that's returning an array of the form {'name': 'value1', 'value': '1'}, which is not what i want
[09:10:51] <majd> SeanJM: oops - yes
[09:11:07] <light_dark> Finally, I found out. I missed the close tag of "</script". Oh, my wasting 2.5 hours. thanks everyone
[09:11:20] <light_dark> </script>
[09:12:07] <cviebrock> with this <input name="theme[logo_bgcolor]">  why doesn't this work: $('input[name=theme\\[logo_bgcolor\\]').val('foo');
[09:13:03] <SeanJM> cviebrock: $('input[name="theme\\[logo_bgcolor\\]"').val
[09:14:03] <silverwind> lawlz... why do people keep adding fucking brackets in their field names..
[09:15:03] <cviebrock> SeanJM: nope â€¦ that didn't do it either
[09:15:22] <cviebrock> silverwind: server-side form processing is easier that way (at least with PHP)
[09:15:42] <Famic> entrada: I wouldn't know what to keep and what to leave out for a jsfiddle, but you can see it at http://ringabell.lindicible.com/ : I want the label (zoom icon) on the left of the search field to act as submit
[09:16:10] <majd> thoughts, anyone?
[09:16:13] <Anticom> silverwind agree
[09:18:59] <jdeuce> cviebrock:
[09:19:04] <djang0nub> why doesnt this get the options of the select correctly? http://fixee.org/paste/fdohkts/#url=l6p8086. someone help please!
[09:19:06] <jdeuce> cviebrock: $("input[name='theme[logo_bgcolor]']").val
[09:19:56] <jdeuce> cviebrock: actually your first method works too, you just missed the closing ] $('input[name=theme\\[logo_bgcolor\\]]').val('foo');â€‹
[09:20:02] <cviebrock> ah
[09:20:03] <cviebrock> crao
[09:20:09] <cviebrock> crap â€¦ so i did â€¦ thank you

[09:23:13] <SeanJM> my output from a $.load looks like this: \n Social Game UI Designer - Global Hires (Long Term)<\/a> <\/h3>\n <-- how do I fix this?
[09:25:19] <FrozenFire> When using the focusout or blur event, it seems that it's being fired on all children as well, instead of just the targeted element. Is there any way to only fire this when a particular container element loses focus?
[09:28:14] <silverwind> FrozenFire, blur shouldn't bubble so you shouldn't have that problem
[09:28:48] <Famic> entrada: to my surprise, I get the same error with a minimal setup on jsfiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/H4p2b/
[09:29:02] <FrozenFire> silverwind, I wish that were the case
[09:29:13] <Famic> clicking on the label is supposed to submit the form, it throws an error
[09:29:28] <juha_> SeanJM: when you append that to some element, how does it look on the page?
[09:31:08] <SeanJM> juha_: http://awesomescreenshot.com/073amvxb0
[09:31:51] <SeanJM> juha_: I'm taking some time to get into Ajax a bit--so I am new to it.
[09:36:49] <Famic> anyone has any idea why this goes wrong ? http://jsfiddle.net/H4p2b/4/
[09:37:05] <Famic> -> "Uncaught TypeError: Property 'submit' of object #<HTMLFormElement> is not a function "
[09:38:04] <Famic> that looks more and more like a real bug
[09:38:50] <jedimind> yes, there are millions of people who use jquery, and you somehow are the first one to stumble across a bug where it cant submit a form
[09:38:51] <jedimind> ...
[09:39:01] <Famic> lol
[09:39:23] <Famic> jedimind: jquery changes, bugs happen, people report them, other people fix them. That's the way of life :p
[09:39:24] <jedimind> why would you want to submit a form when you click on a label?
[09:39:54] <jedimind> Famic, http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/H4p2b/7/
[09:40:23] <Famic> jedimind: so ? still throwing the error
[09:40:58] <juha_> Famic: $("form").submit() right?
[09:41:14] <juha_> Famic: or $("form").each(function() {$(this).submit();});
[09:41:26] <juha_> SeanJM: how are you printing your result?
[09:41:27] <SeanJM> Famic: http://jsfiddle.net/H4p2b/8/ <---
[09:42:00] <SeanJM> juha_: searchResults.append(more);
[09:42:20] <juha_> SeanJM: try searchResults.append($(more)); if this would help
[09:42:28] <Famic> SeanJM: yeah, but triggering the click on the submit button is not the best approach imho. jquery is supposed to be able to submit the form without it
[09:42:45] <Famic> it's an overhead
[09:42:50] <juha_> ?submit @ Famic
[09:42:50] <bot-t> Famic, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[09:43:19] <Famic> juha_: do you somehow believe I didn't go there ? ^^
[09:44:22] <jedimind> i still dont understand why you're trying to submit a form on label click
[09:44:45] <jedimind> weird
[09:44:46] <shoky> Famic: the problem is that your button's name is also 'submit'
[09:44:56] <jedimind> yeah, the name is throwing it off
[09:45:00] <jedimind> i just found taht
[09:45:14] <Famic> shoky: nice catch

[09:45:28] <jedimind> also, i generally tend to use <button> for submit rather than input type="submit"
[09:45:54] <shoky> easy to catch with console.log( $('#searchform')[0].submit )
[09:45:57] <Famic> jedimind: I'm in a wordpress setup, I didn't alter the searchform â€“yet
[09:46:03] <shoky> just following what the error says
[09:46:12] <shoky> its not a function, ok so lets check what it is.
[09:46:35] <SeanJM> juha_: searchResults.append($(more)); <-- didn't change the result
[09:47:10] <Famic> shoky: right. I should have thought about that
[09:47:42] <Famic> I just assumed that it was missing, not something else
[09:48:07] <Famic> thanks
[09:48:07] <jedimind> fuck i have to finish this blog post tutorial today, but im so unmotivated
[09:48:11] <jedimind> on account that its monday
[09:48:11] <Kingsy> anyone used backstretch before ?
[09:48:16] <jedimind> </pointlessramble>
[09:48:21] <shoky> then it would say something like Object #<smth> has no method 'submit
[09:48:47] <shoky> nvm
[09:49:56] <Famic> shoky: when you're right, you're right ;)
[09:50:13] <jedimind> strangely enough, when you're wrong, you're also right
[09:50:36] <shoky> even more so
[09:51:04] <Kingsy> ok generic question then.. if you run   jQuery.backstretch(images[index]);   and then  jQuery.backstretch(images[index]); (with a different image array) does that mean there are TWO instances of backstretch running?
[09:52:53] <LoneStar99> anyone here use firebug?
[09:52:59] <shoky> Kingsy: isn't it just for ONE background image?
[09:52:59] <snover> no, nobody
[09:53:02] <LoneStar99> for firefox?
[09:53:21] <entrada> Kingsy: I've used it.
[09:53:40] <entrada> Kingsy: just change the img src instead
[09:53:52] <Kingsy> shoky: no, you can use it as a slider
[09:54:08] <entrada> Kingsy: backstretch does not clean up the element or the event handlers if you call it again
[09:54:16] <Kingsy> entrada - what do you mean?
[09:54:18] <entrada> which means you will have two background images
[09:54:22] <Kingsy> ah right
[09:54:22] <shoky> Kingsy: but it'll still only have one background image
[09:54:23] <entrada> i had that problem once
[09:54:25] <shoky> at a  time
[09:54:27] <LoneStar99> my firefox is using up 2gigs of memory is that normal?
[09:54:43] <Kingsy> entrada: so how did you fix it ?
[09:54:44] <entrada> shaky is right, so Kingsy remove the div from the body before you call it again
[09:54:56] <Kingsy> right
[09:56:39] <shoky> backstretch does clean up the old images
[09:57:25] <Kingsy> that didnt work..
[09:57:28] <Kingsy> jQuery('#backstretch').remove();   <-- I mean
[09:57:33] <shoky> dont remove it
[09:58:24] <entrada> no
[09:58:26] <entrada> remove the div
[09:58:35] <entrada> oh is that the div's id?
[09:58:36] <shoky> what div?
[09:58:38] <Kingsy> I did..
[09:58:45] <entrada> the one backstretch applies
[09:58:47] <Kingsy> shoky: the div that backstretch creates
[09:58:53] <shoky> why would you remove it
[09:59:16] <entrada> so that Kingsy can use another background image
[09:59:23] <shoky> just call backstretch again ..
[09:59:25] <Kingsy> see the image gallery works.. it switches just great.. but the next and previous have weird effects
[09:59:26] <shoky> just lie the examples show
[09:59:31] <shoky> like
[10:00:02] <entrada> if it handles changing the image fine, then go ahead.. i haven't tested the latest version
[10:00:16] <someprimetime> is there a reason why $(val).data('bound', 'true'); is not working but $(val).attr('data-bound', 'true'); is?
[10:00:20] <Kingsy> this is difficult to explain.. look -->   http://www.pthek.com/index.php/choose/     wait for the slideshow to start (takes a while) and click gargoyles then click the next and previous arrows
[10:00:24] <Kingsy> you will see what I mean
[10:00:32] <Kingsy> entrada: shoky ^^^^
[10:00:34] <shoky> someprimetime: those 2 do totally different things
[10:00:58] <entrada> someprimetime: mostly different things
[10:01:04] <someprimetime> shoky: right but I want to use the data attribute and can't seem to
[10:01:23] <shoky> someprimetime: .data() only reads the data-XXX attributes on the first call
[10:01:32] <Kingsy> you can see that the next and previous are flicking through the slideshow but its still showing images from the previous show for a second
[10:01:38] <someprimetime> shoky: ahh so I have to set them with attr first?
[10:01:55] <shoky> someprimetime: i dono, depends what you wanna do
[10:02:10] <someprimetime> shoky: just want to initially set a value after a handler has been assigned to something
[10:02:13] <someprimetime> should i use a class instead?
[10:02:33] <Kingsy> so its almost like when I am loading the new gallery its just loading it ontop of the old one.. so they are both running
[10:02:34] <shoky> someprimetime: why not .data('bound', true) ?
[10:02:37] <Kingsy> entrada: do you see what I mean ?
[10:04:35] <LoneStar99> sorry for not asking jquery specific questions, was just trying to figure out if other web devs encounter memory leaks on firefox...
[10:04:40] <Kingsy> shoky: see what I mean ?
[10:05:29] <tgodar> so, have this jquery ui datepicker issue where no matter what I do the thing always has a z-index equal to 1 and I get crap showing in foreground over dtp selector
[10:06:17] <shoky> Kingsy: are you unbinding the click handlers anywhere? cause you keep re-binding them
[10:06:32] <Kingsy> shoky: umm no..
[10:06:38] <shoky> adding more and more click listeners to the same buttons
[10:07:09] <shoky> then obviously it wont work good ;p
[10:08:16] <Kingsy> shoky: try it now..
[10:08:36] <someprimetime> shoky: you mean like: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/Epu7e/ ?
[10:08:43] <someprimetime> that's basically what I'm doing anyway
[10:08:50] <Kingsy> that is what happens when you don't apply new click handlers.. after you change the gallery when you click next it reverts back to the old gallery
[10:08:56] <someprimetime> woops h/o
[10:08:57] <someprimetime> it's too early
[10:09:01] <someprimetime> i just did class="#blah"
[10:09:14] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/Epu7e/1/
[10:09:17] <shoky> Kingsy: i didnt tell you not to apply new click handlers
[10:09:24] <someprimetime> so it just reads it the first time? :\
[10:09:32] <shoky> Kingsy: i just said that the OLD click handlers are still running too
[10:09:32] <Kingsy> shoky: how do you unbind the old ones ?
[10:09:44] <shoky> Kingsy: .off()
[10:10:33] <shoky> someprimetime: what?
[10:10:33] <Kingsy> like.. .off("click"); or just off(); ?
[10:10:51] <shoky> Kingsy: both would work, read about it
[10:11:04] <shoky> you might wanna look at event namespaces too
[10:11:26] <someprimetime> shoky: well i want to basically just set those data attributes to true on all list elements once the script has loaded
[10:11:32] <shoky> you could do  .off('mystuff').on('click.mystuff', function...)
[10:11:52] <someprimetime> but i guess data-* would only be read the first time like you said?
[10:12:01] <shoky> someprimetime: .data() doesnt set any data-* attributes
[10:12:01] <Kingsy> shoky: yeah that is exactly what I needed..
[10:12:31] <shoky> someprimetime: yea and it reads them only the first time
[10:12:47] <someprimetime> shoky: what do you recommend I use instead? basically i'm binding a bunch of list elements and after they're bound i want to set some kind of value to true
[10:12:55] <someprimetime> should i just add a class to those elements that have been bound instead?
[10:13:03] <shoky> someprimetime: why does it need to be a data-* attribute?
[10:13:03] <someprimetime> then check for the existance of that?
[10:13:08] <someprimetime> shoky: it doesn't
[10:13:13] <shoky> just use a class, sure
[10:13:19] <someprimetime> ah cool sounds good thanks
[10:13:21] <Kingsy> shoky: out of curiousity.. if you have a interval being run every 5 seconds .. I guess that is like a countdown at the end of which the code is executed.. can you manually reset the timer?
[10:13:38] <shoky> Kingsy: you can only clear it
[10:13:44] <shoky> Kingsy: and set another one
[10:14:08] <Kingsy> ok np
[10:14:23] <djang0nub> when i have code like $('css..').each(function(){ return x; });, is there a way to make the return value of that whole line an array composed of the returns from the each()
[10:14:44] <shoky> djang0nub: you want .map()
[10:15:40] <djang0nub> shoky: ahh that looks right, thanks!
[10:17:17] <tgodar> argh shit is worse than using word press plugins
[10:22:46] <djang0nub> shoky: wow that makes things a lot simpler... all this time i thought each() was map()
[10:30:00] <webBuilder> hello friends I have data coming from an xml, and I receive the data via jquery. I have a radio button that needs to be selected according to the data that I'm receiving from this xml file. how can I can select specific radio button with jquery. Thank you
[10:31:24] <webBuilder> in other word if I have 3 radio button grouped by name and they have the value of 10, 20, 30, and the xml file points to 20 I would like to select the radio button with the value of 20
[10:31:27] <webBuilder> how can I can do that
[10:41:25] <Strausser> Hey guys. Is it poible to stop a function chain in jquery? Say, a condition wasnt met along the way
[10:41:26] <gus_> webBuilder: http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/how-to-select-a-radio-button-with-jquery/
[10:41:32] <Strausser> return false; didnt work :\
[10:42:50] <shoky> webBuilder: $('input[name=radioname][value=20]').prop('checked',true);?
[10:43:22] <shoky> oops donno where that question mark came from
[10:43:39] <shoky> prolly jsfiddle
[10:43:48] <webBuilder> shoky,and gus_ thank you so much I'll try it right now and get back to you guys
[10:43:51] <webBuilder> thank you again
[10:44:38] <tgodar> why cant i make the button text bold?  http://jsfiddle.net/rymaX/1/
[10:45:32] <shoky> tgodar: .css('font-weight', 'bold')
[10:45:37] <shoky> (same with 'normal')
[10:45:44] <tgodar> sigh :) thanks
[10:45:57] <Strausser> Anyone? :p
[10:46:15] <shoky> Strausser: what do you mean stop a function chain?
[10:46:17] <webBuilder> shoky, I tried your but I have several group of radio button all of them that have the value 20 has been checked but I want it to check the by finding by name
[10:46:20] <webBuilder> this is my code
[10:46:20] <webBuilder> jQuery('input[name=nameprojectListFormId:tabView:vendorInterfaceRadioId][value='+vendor+']').prop('checked',true)
[10:46:35] <webBuilder> vendor is = to 20
[10:47:03] <webBuilder> shoky, what is my mistake ?
[10:47:35] <shoky> webBuilder: that looks fine, i'd guess your mistake is elsewhere
[10:47:40] <Strausser> Maybe its just me noobin, but I would like to stop the rest of the chain $obj.mouseover(function(){ //condition hete}).mousemove().mouseout();
[10:48:19] <webBuilder> shoky, well everything works except is selecting everywhere where there is 20 so it is not able to read the name="..."
[10:48:21] <shoky> Strausser: .mouseover()  returns immediately, the condition is not even checked yet
[10:48:37] <webBuilder> shoky, I'll try to put " " between the name let see how it goes
[10:48:38] <Strausser> Oh hmm
[10:48:59] <webBuilder> shoky, nothing
[10:50:11] <shoky> webBuilder: put the name in quotes  jQuery('input[name="nameprojectListFormId:tabView:vendorInterfaceRadioId"][value='+vendor+']')
[10:50:41] <shoky> might as well do the same with the value  [value="'+vendor+'"]
[10:50:54] <webBuilder> shoky, got it
[10:50:57] <webBuilder> let me try again
[10:51:27] <Kingsy> shoky: did you ever have a problem with backstretch cutting about 20 pixels off the top of the images its using?
[10:51:37] <shoky> Kingsy: i've never used it
[10:51:51] <Kingsy> ah
[10:51:58] <Kingsy> entrada: you still around?
[10:52:07] <entrada> Kingsy: yeah
[10:52:38] <Kingsy> entrada: did you ever have problems with backstrech cutting off the top of your images?
[10:52:47] <entrada> Kingsy: of course
[10:52:51] <entrada> thats what it does
[10:53:15] <Phoenixz> So I used .live() to bind to events from specific classes, and now I should start using .on and .off for jQuery 1.7+.. Problem 1: From what I've seen, .on() should not bind to the element itself, but to its parent.. is this true? And if so, WHY? I know the element, I don;t know its parent. .live() worked perfect, why should I stop using it?
[10:53:16] <entrada> it zooms up to twice your resolution, centers the image
[10:53:19] <entrada> so you lose some
[10:53:50] <entrada> its not noticeable much
[10:54:00] <shoky> Phoenixz:   $(selector).live(type, fn)  ===   $(document).on(type, selector, fn)
[10:54:07] <entrada> because you generally use a nice hi res image
[10:54:17] <entrada> mostly a photograph or something
[10:54:29] <Kingsy> entrada: perhaps I picked the wrong plugin then.. this is for a photography website and loosing the top and bottom of images is bad :S
[10:54:33] <Phoenixz> shoky: Ah, makes more sense.. :)
[10:54:34] <shoky> Phoenixz:  not the parent, but a static container element
[10:54:36] <entrada> ah
[10:54:51] <entrada> Kingsy: then you need to see css-tricks
[10:55:04] <shoky> Phoenixz: that is, it's better to be more specific than 'document'  , but it has to be an element that is already in the DOM tree when you call .on
[10:55:15] <entrada> they have some methods of maximizing images
[10:55:19] <entrada> background images
[10:55:54] <Kingsy> entrada: do you have a specific link byh chance?
[10:55:55] <Phoenixz> shoky: thanks!
[10:56:08] <entrada> Kingsy: let me check
[10:56:16] <webBuilder> shoky, thank you so much it worked,
[10:56:31] <shoky> np guise
[10:57:00] <Strausser> shoky: so in mouseover().mousemove().mouseout(), i would have to unbind mousemove() and mouseout() to prevent them form executing if a condition fails in the first? (mouseover)
[10:57:13] <entrada> Kingsy: http://css-tricks.com/how-to-resizeable-background-image/
[10:57:19] <entrada> Kingsy: http://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/
[10:57:27] <shoky> Strausser: that's one way to go, yeah
[10:57:54] <Strausser> Hmm ill try that
[10:59:29] <Kingsy> entrada: thanks I will look into that
[11:00:51] <Strausser> That worked! Thx
[11:04:42] <lancealtar> ?on
[11:04:43] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:11:35] <ptahdunbar> whats the best way to trigger widgets for new elements on a page?
[11:17:17] <shoky> ptahdunbar: just call the method normally
[11:17:36] <shoky> after adding the elements
[11:18:15] <FernandoBasso> Is it possible to check if any select box in a documetn has changed?
[11:19:55] <ptahdunbar> shoky: got it finally. my issue was that i was cloning existing elements that already added widget support. i had to remove the classes that the widget adds and it worked :)
[11:24:44] <tplaner_> does anyone know any good UI plugins for jquery which combine selectable + draggable -- jquery ui does not handle this well and most of the plugins I've found are fairly dated (2008-ish)
[11:33:19] <conord> I've got a question about scope and events inside an object that creates new elements.  http://jsfiddle.net/kmfstudios/EwC3r/
[11:34:20] <conord> I want to attach the method 'show_clicked' to the newly created li elements.  If you click them, you get a 'li has no method show_clicked'.
[11:34:34] <conord> Suggestions?
[11:39:47] <tgodar> anyone got any suggestions on getting date of 'last quarter' with js?  date.js doesn't seem to have anything.
[11:40:19] <NoiseEee> what is a last quarter?
[11:41:02] <NoiseEee> like from today you'd want "January 1st" ?
[11:41:37] <tgodar> NoiseEee.. thats right
[11:42:09] <tgodar> NoiseEee: suppose Ill have to actually have write code to solve..
[11:42:24] <tgodar> these parse() strtotime type things have made me lazy
[11:42:30] <Cameron_> how can i create a google map with jquery?
[11:42:36] <NoiseEee> indeed
[11:42:37] <Cameron_> *chart
[11:42:45] <Cameron_> when i click the button a chart is generated
[11:43:09] <tgodar> Cameron_: gvis from google?
[11:43:34] <Cameron_> what tgodar?
[11:44:13] <tgodar> Cameron_: you want to create a google chart?  google visualization == gvis
[11:44:51] <Cameron_> no google charts https://developers.google.com/chart/ tgodar
[11:45:14] <tgodar> Cameron_: same thing.  not personally familiar with any jquery plugin wrappers.  I'd start just vanilla JS and learning the api... http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/
[11:45:54] <Cameron_> i understand the api but when i load the chart inside jquery it shows then hides again instantly
[11:46:13] <Dustin> Hi there, have a question. Is it proper practice while templating with PHP (include header, footer etc) to include my js include to specific pages. IE, my login page is built up of including a header, a footer and a panel, for the main content I just hard-code my html. Under the html, can I put my scrip include? or should it be included in the header (which is included on all pages)?
[11:46:27] <tgodar> Cameron_: your gonna have to give a little more detail.  provide code
[11:46:43] <someprimetime> how can i put this into its own function? http://jsfiddle.net/XUjPe/
[11:46:43] <Cameron_> okay 1 sec
[11:46:46] <tgodar> Cameron_: you use Prototype on your stack too?
[11:47:02] <Cameron_> what?
[11:47:19] <tgodar> only collisions with google stuff ive had has been really outdated prototype / scriptaculous code
[11:47:31] <someprimetime> because right now it relies on the () at the end and if i put it into a namespace like b.gallery.addEvent(), it'll not work
[11:48:37] <dimsum> Howdy, fancybox2 + ie7 problem, care to help? http://staging.definitelyworks.com/bank-mandiri/video.html#mandiri-fiesta-tvc
[11:52:01] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, I have this code -> $.cookie("welcomescreen", true, { expires: 365 });  However, in my if condition, I have to wrap my true with double quotes to make it match. Why? if ($.cookie("welcomescreen") === "true") {
[11:52:13] <Cameron_> some weird how i managed to solve it myself
[11:53:58] <MarkMorcom> Can someone point me to a good tutorial on Jquery functions for a total noob
[11:54:35] <dogmatic69> Where is a good place for storing loads of (json) data?
[11:54:45] <NoiseEee> a database?
[11:55:06] <dogmatic69> NoiseEee: no, from an api call.. was busy putting a bit more details. one sec
[11:55:09] <tgodar> MarkMorcom: https://developer.mozilla.org - avoid w3schools, its for fools
[11:55:21] <tgodar> err... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference
[11:55:22] <MarkMorcom> Thanks tgodar
[11:55:52] <dogmatic69> API returns data for a chart (highcharts) that contains 3 different charts. I add and remove them dynamically but only show one at a time
[11:56:29] <tgodar> dogmatic69: an array in your global scope perhaps?  just push data on / pop off as needd
[11:56:48] <tgodar> more complex you can implement some caching there too
[11:56:52] <dogmatic69> so the api returns [[1k points], [1k points], [1k points]] and I just redraw the chart when clicking buttons
[11:57:39] <dogmatic69> tgodar: ye, was thinking that. How do you do it global? just define var foobar =[]; outside the $.fn.extend code?
[11:57:55] <dogmatic69> tgodar: I am thinking of caching too
[11:58:58] <dogmatic69> I was thinking of doing something like foobar.md5ofParams = $.ajax(...);
[11:59:20] <dogmatic69> then just check if foobar.md5ofparams exists before calling again.
[11:59:21] <tgodar> dogmatic69: yup, simple as that
[11:59:42] <dogmatic69> I guess I could take it all the way and use html5 storage thingy
[12:00:06] <tgodar> i was always fond of Dojo's approach to data stores
[12:01:20] <dogmatic69> tgodar: is that something like $.cache.store('name', $data) and $.cache.fetch('name')
[12:01:31] <tgodar> dogmatic69: jQuery UI's autocomplete does some basic caching along lines of what you were thinking if you want an example, but as you described its pretty straightforward
[12:01:38] <phrearch> hi
[12:01:39] <dogmatic69> I might just make a little plugin like that
[12:02:06] <tgodar> dogmatic69: go for it.
[12:02:09] <dogmatic69> tgodar: ta, will check it out
[12:02:11] <phrearch> suppose i have a json variable with both html and javascript(between script tags). is it possible to inject the whole thing into the dom with the javascript being interpreted correctly?
[12:02:49] <tgodar> phrearch: is it valid JSON?  passes JSON Lint for example?
[12:03:30] <tgodar> oh, wait, nvm.
[12:04:07] <Dustin> Hi there, have a question. Is it proper practice while templating with PHP (include header, footer etc) to include my js include to specific pages. IE, my login page is built up of including a header, a footer and a panel, for the main content I just hard-code my html. Under the html, can I put my scrip include? or should it be included in the header (which is included on all pages)?
[12:04:24] <phrearch> tgodar: the problem is that doing .html(foo) on a selector wont work for the js part
[12:05:37] <tgodar> phrearch: it can be done, and should not need an eval or anything - sec while I think
[12:07:35] <jasabella> um, what's a good css framework for jquery-ui that will size to the viewport?
[12:07:36] <phrearch> the output looks like http://pastie.org/4267679
[12:07:55] <phrearch> jasabella: twitter bootstrap can be used with jquery-ui
[12:08:08] <phrearch> its pretty good at sizing
[12:08:18] <tgodar> ugh total brain fart.. I always run into this when using a dialog to load up remove content..
[12:08:33] <phrearch> :)
[12:09:54] <jasabella> im looking at jqueryui bootstrap
[12:10:20] <phrearch> probably better to use bootstrap's css classes all the way, but that also seems to be a possibility
[12:10:35] <tgodar> phrearch: see .load() or getScript()... thats all I can think og
[12:10:42] <phrearch> tgodar: ah thanks
[12:10:46] <jasabella> bootstrap doesnt seem to be vertically aware though :/
[12:11:25] <tgodar> phrearch: its something like that... someone here should know.  gotta run
[12:13:20] <MarkMorcom> Im sorry, I am simply not getting Jquery functions. I program PHP, so I know how to do something like this | FunctionName(var1, var2) {This is a var1, and this is a var2} echo FunctionName("Cat", "Dog"). Is this at all possible in Jquery?
[12:15:22] <phrearch> MarkMorcom: checkout javascript function syntax?
[12:15:30] <dougb> MarkMorcom: I'd assume you could do the same: FunctionName(var var1, var var2) { return "This is a " + var1 + ", and this is a " + var2; }
[12:15:50] <MarkMorcom> Thanks dougb
[12:16:01] <dougb> np
[12:16:40] <MarkMorcom> All I really want to do is make this piece of code re-usable http://www.jspaste.com/?id=401
[12:16:57] <MarkMorcom> Not sure if a funtion is even the best option
[12:18:40] <Timpet> Is there any know issues with with $("select#elementId option:selected").val() and ie 7 ?
[12:19:06] <amirite> the issue timpet is that you're coding for ie7
[12:19:07] <amirite> don't
[12:19:30] <Timpet> Amirite, i code for what users are using
[12:19:39] <Timpet> I i try to aim for all
[12:19:49] <Timpet> :)
[12:22:24] <amirite> your users are stupid
[12:22:29] <amirite> hit them
[12:22:35] <amirite> teach them
[12:22:40] <amirite> beat them with a belt
[12:24:33] <d3f4ultr0> good afternoon folks, can someone please provide a good link about DOMs? I want to know more about them
[12:27:17] <Timpet> Amirite, i would but they are the ones holding the cash :P
[12:27:34] <amirite> doms are spherical objects that contain references to tangential paradigms
[12:29:12] <TheEternalAbyss> hello... had a question about jscrollpane. Firstly excuse my noobness, but I have the file included with other plugins that for a minified main.js. The code is all there and I need to initialize it and I figure I shoul duse the API methodlolgy, however, I'm not 100% where I need to put that...
[12:29:27] <TheEternalAbyss> shoul dI put it at the end of the jscrollpane.js file?
[12:30:44] <MistuhKurtz> is there a way to write an immediately-invoked function expression that's not an anonymous function?
[12:33:47] <Timpet> Anyone that doens anything about my question?
[12:34:23] <amirite> why not test on ie7
[12:34:28] <amirite> if you're so keen to support it
[12:34:30] <amirite> install it and use it
[12:38:11] <MistuhKurtz> Timpet, jQuery still supports IE6
[12:38:21] <MistuhKurtz> I would expect any native jQuery function to work just fine in IE7, then.
[12:38:45] <MistuhKurtz> TheEternalAbyss,
[12:38:49] <Timpet> okey thanks..
[12:39:12] <TheEternalAbyss> eh?
[12:39:13] <MistuhKurtz> I usually have my plugins and the code that initializes them in separate files... plugins.js and sitename.js
[12:39:18] <TheEternalAbyss> IE7 isn't my issue
[12:39:26] <TheEternalAbyss> oh
[12:39:36] <amirite> radiskull and devildog
[12:39:58] <TheEternalAbyss> well the way they have is structured here at work confuses me cause they have a load of plugins and js that minifies to a single .js file
[12:40:02] <MistuhKurtz> and that's how I almost always see it done. Occasionally with something like wordpress I'll see the plugin and the initialization in the same file, but it's confusing and annoying
[12:40:22] <Timpet> How do i run tests on ie 7 when i dont have that version then? Any smart way to do so?
[12:40:45] <TheEternalAbyss> in IE9 hit f12 and change the rendering engone in the dev tool
[12:40:46] <silverwind> Timpet, download a virtual machine from microsoft..
[12:40:46] <PrgmrBill> Timpet: IE9 dev toolbar allows you to run as IE7/8/whatever
[12:40:47] <MistuhKurtz> TheEternalAbyss, well if the dev files are organized in separate files and you use a build script to compile to a single js then I see nothing wrong with that
[12:41:07] <TheEternalAbyss> MistuhKurtz: yea that's pretty much how it's done
[12:41:15] <MistuhKurtz> sounds pretty standard
[12:41:19] <silverwind> The IE7 emulation is not perfect... be carefulz0r
[12:41:28] <wavez> I'm trying to add new members to a jqgrid object. I can't even find the jqgrid constructor online. Does anyone know how I can do this?
[12:42:27] <wavez> Oh, I guess it's __construct(). Now how to add members to it
[12:45:57] <mysphyt> Hey, folks. Is there a way to fire the default action of an event after a delay? So, like, instead of just event.preventDefault in a handler, $(this).delay(1000).nowRunDefault()?
[12:46:05] <mysphyt> (Obviously I am making the last bit up.)
[12:47:35] <snover> ?settimeout @ mysphyt
[12:47:36] <bot-t> mysphyt, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[12:48:38] <mysphyt> snover: Sorry, yes. I'm familiar with setTimeout, but the API doesn't suggest that there's a method on the eventData passed to a handler that will execute the default action on demand.
[12:49:32] <Timpet> It is the emulation that return an error on: $("select#elementId option:selected").val()
[12:49:42] <snover> mysphyt: thereâ€™s no way to just run the default action like that
[12:50:05] <snover> but itâ€™s like, not so difficult to just emulate most of them
[12:50:07] <MistuhKurtz> mysphyt, what is the default action you're trying to invoke?
[12:50:12] <mysphyt> snover: That's what I was afraid of.
[12:50:20] <snover> dunno what you are afraid of
[12:50:39] <mysphyt> snover: Well, not afraid as such--I was just hoping there was a way to do that, and I thought there might not be.
[12:51:23] <Timpet> Is there another way to get the selected value of a dropdown menu than this one: $("select#elementId option:selected").val() ?
[12:51:49] <MistuhKurtz> Timpet, $("select#id").val();
[12:51:57] <MistuhKurtz> i think
[12:52:07] <silverwind> MistuhKurtz, yeah.
[12:52:24] <silverwind> Just $('#id').val() would be enough :P
[12:52:26] <mysphyt> snover, MistuhKurtz: I've just realized I'm thinking about this the wrong way, anyway; the default is only the browser default, and if a plugin is doing anything it's handled with another click event. So I'm being silly.
[12:52:55] <MistuhKurtz> glad you figured it out :P
[12:53:35] <mysphyt> I generally find when a problem seems more complex than it should be it mostly means I'm thinking too hard.
[13:06:39] <mdeboard> Hi. So I'm reading through some code and trying to understand  the .is() method. We've got a conditional block e.g. https://gist.github.com/1130cec448b98a8f313f, and when clicking on the "label" element, it also fires off the code like the "input" element was also clicked. Is there something I'm misunderstanding about the .is() method? Does it do a partial match?
[13:07:35] <silverwind> It does exactly what it says...
[13:08:03] <silverwind> It tests if a node matches a selector.
[13:08:06] <mdeboard> silverwind: I believe you, that's why I asked if I was misunderstanding something. I wouldn't expect it to match on two different elements
[13:08:20] <mdeboard> I'm newish to jquery, so a selector can be a partial match?
[13:08:33] <LessSeen> yep
[13:08:38] <silverwind> The first one checks if it's a checkbox..
[13:08:51] <silverwind> The second one, a label, so they're not the same
[13:08:53] <mdeboard> $.is('.a .b c') will match $('.a .b') then?
[13:09:02] <silverwind> No
[13:09:08] <zim> Hi all got a dialog Q here http://jsfiddle.net/mRpXX/ would be great if someone could have a look.
[13:09:29] <LessSeen> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:09:44] <silverwind> The first one would match a <c> that is in an element of class .b which is inside an element of class .a
[13:10:05] <LindsayMac> hey guys.. Looking for a little help with something. I'm still new to javascript, so forgive me for my newbness..
[13:10:06] <silverwind> s/match a/match all
[13:10:12] <zim> mdeboard: will match c in b in a
[13:10:35] <LindsayMac> I am trying to find a way to animate the height of a box based on where in the viewport we are. I have pared down and outlined the basics of my code here http://jsfiddle.net/5et3t/
[13:11:02] <wavez> How do I add a new persistent variable to an object?
[13:11:14] <LindsayMac> Basically i have a smooth scroll on the nav links up top. Clicking on them should scroll to the box with the article content. For some reason its not working on jsfiddle, but i have that working on my site.
[13:11:31] <LindsayMac> What I want to do is change the height of the white-box based on which article we are on
[13:11:42] <shoky> wavez: what do you mean persisten?
[13:11:42] <shoky> t
[13:12:13] <wavez> shoky, a variable that is persistent to the life of that object. Something like this.myVariable
[13:12:23] <wavez> this.variable is not working for me.
[13:12:28] <shoky> why 'this' ?
[13:12:34] <wavez> this meaning my object
[13:12:42] <wavez> it's a jqgrid object
[13:12:42] <shoky> myObj.variable = 'bla'
[13:12:43] <shoky> works
[13:12:53] <wavez> oh...
[13:12:55] <shoky> if this === myObj
[13:12:59] <shoky> then this.variable = 'bla'
[13:13:00] <shoky> also works
[13:13:10] <wavez> var myObj = $(this)
[13:13:20] <wavez> okay... I'll try that
[13:13:22] <shoky> so not just an object..
[13:13:39] <zim> addendum to my question. while it is a .dialog question I think the main problem is binding http://jsfiddle.net/mRpXX/
[13:13:59] <shoky> wavez: if you want data that is linked to an element, use .data()
[13:14:04] <mdeboard> zim, silverwind: Ok, I understand that now. I do not understand why when I click on the label element here https://gist.github.com/047f9269eff60ed67ad9 do both of the code blocks here https://gist.github.com/1130cec448b98a8f313f get executed?
[13:14:12] <fission6> is there a way to take all form fields, get their values and remove the input, sort of like an 'edit' and a 'preview' mode
[13:14:25] <jedimind> LindsayMac, take a look at waypoints
[13:14:35] <jedimind> LindsayMac, http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[13:14:46] <wavez> shoky, perfect. :D
[13:15:12] <shoky> wavez: that is hardly 'a variable that is persistent to the life of an object' :P
[13:15:13] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  OMG THAT LOOKS LIKE PERFECTION !
[13:15:17] <shoky> an object means a javascript object
[13:15:19] <zim> mdeboard: put it in jsfiddle as I will be able to see both at the same time
[13:15:27] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  going to go try it.. but i may be back with additional questions. THANKS
[13:15:36] <mdeboard> zim: Ok, one second
[13:15:37] <jedimind> LindsayMac, no problem
[13:16:49] <wavez> shoky, oh?
[13:17:31] <soee> hi, is it possible to get remote page content using jquery on my local machine (its now tany webserver just simple html + js)
[13:17:47] <wavez> shoky, 'private member' I think is the correct terminology.
[13:18:33] <shoky> wavez: not really, cause you're not interested in a property/field of an object
[13:18:53] <shoky> you're interested in data that's linked to an _element_
[13:19:09] <shoky> and there's nothing private about it
[13:20:00] <shoky> zim: you're doing  $('#dialog_form').serialize()     is there more than one #dialog_form ??
[13:20:46] <zim> shoky: no but I think the problem is it is loaded by the ajax
[13:21:12] <shoky> zim: you wrote in your comment: // But is not binding to #dialog_form which originated from dialog.body
[13:21:31] <zim> yes
[13:21:34] <shoky> seemed that you're implying that it's binding to a different #dialog_form
[13:21:37] <wavez> shoky, the jqGrid object is not an instance of the jqGrid class?
[13:22:12] <zim> shoky: sorry no its not binding to anything the post is empty
[13:22:18] <shoky> wavez: there are no classes in javascript, so technically, no.  i dont really know jqGrid tho
[13:22:42] <shoky> zim: and you're sure there is a #dialog_form in the DOM ?
[13:22:46] <wavez> shoky, oh. I guess I don't understand OOP in JS then
[13:25:42] <zim> shoky: Well I can see it in firebug but not sure if its in the DOM
[13:26:16] <shoky> zim: if you console.log( $('#dialog_form') )  right before the post
[13:26:27] <shoky> er, console.log( $('#dialog_form').length )
[13:26:32] <shoky> watcha get
[13:26:44] <zim> will do ty BRB
[13:27:23] <zim> shoky: 1
[13:27:55] <noregret> http://pastie.org/4268048 how can I empty the <div> but keep the <ul> ?
[13:28:35] <shoky> zim: and  console.log( $('#dialog_form').serialize() ) ?
[13:29:11] <zim> shoky: (an empty string)
[13:29:44] <shoky> well it's finding your form but it doesn't serialize it. something is messed up with your form, adunno ;P
[13:29:51] <fission6> so if i have a form with a bunch of text inpyt fields, using jquery how can i remove the inpyt fields and just push the text in the area? think of an edit and save type mode
[13:30:06] <shoky> zim: i doubt it has to do with ajax (unless your ajax response doesnt have the proper html for the form, etc..)
[13:30:54] <jedimind> noregret, .unwrap
[13:31:10] <zim> shoky: sorry just found the stupid error but Thanks for your help any ideas on the button name?
[13:31:11] <jedimind> oh sorry, you meant empty everything except the UL but keep the DIV there ?
[13:31:19] <jedimind> just move the UL somewhere temporarily, empty the div, then move it back
[13:32:34] <shoky> zim: i think you'd need to create that buttons object literal beforehand
[13:33:07] <MistuhKurtz> I'm using the jquery cycle plugin, and I'm trying to create multiple slideshows on a page, each with their own next and prev buttons, but I can't seem to get the buttons to work their own instances of cycle...instead, clicking a 'next' button triggers next for all of the slideshows
[13:33:37] <MistuhKurtz> has anybody needed to create something similar?
[13:33:52] <zim> shoky: how would I do that?
[13:34:04] <Pilate> MistuhKurtz: do you have an example page
[13:34:07] <shoky> zim: like this http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/mRpXX/1/
[13:34:13] <MistuhKurtz> I guess I could loop over the different slideshow containers and call cycle for each one, but that's messy
[13:34:23] <zim> TY many thanks
[13:34:23] <MistuhKurtz> I'll put together a fiddle..
[13:34:28] <shoky> np
[13:41:01] <mysphyt> Is there any way to get the original unit a css value is set in? So, if I have an element that's styled font-size: 1.25em, can I get the 1.25em instead of the 20px (or whatever) that elem.css('font-size') generally returns?
[13:41:14] <MistuhKurtz> Pilate, http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/MgEGs/1/
[13:42:26] <mister_m> hi I am looking to select everything in a column of a table - but I am having difficulty using the table object I have already selected. I found this snippet on stack overflow: "$("table.Table22 > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(even)").css("background","blue");", but in my code I already have the table wrapped in a jquery object - is there a way I can  combine selectors on my object to do the same thing as the above?
[13:42:49] <Dustin> Hi there, looking for some help implementing a jquery slider, which initially has a form set to disabled, upon sliding the slider, it enables the form. Any simple way to do this, for a jQuery newb?
[13:42:55] <shoky> mister_m:  .find()
[13:43:15] <MistuhKurtz> Pilate,  I'm switching from a carousel plugin, http://caroufredsel.frebsite.nl/ to jquery Cycle because for whatever reason, the carousel plugin was executing poorly performance-wise. I figured a mature plugin like cycle would help.
[13:44:11] <mysphyt> Dustin: Do you have a particular slider in mind? Are you using a plugin or rolling your own?
[13:45:17] <Dustin> mysphyt: wanting to roll my own. Just a simple, 150PX wide slider that you scroll to the right, to enable the form
[13:45:58] <mister_m> shoky: that works - but find will keep selecting tds beyong the table I have in $(this)
[13:46:25] <mister_m> won't it?
[13:46:28] <MistuhKurtz> Dustin, usually plugins have callback functions that let you hook your own code into the plugin... like, afterTransition: function(){ $("#form").removeAttr('disabled'); }
[13:46:37] <mister_m> or can I prevent that with '>' in selectors?
[13:46:52] <wavez> shoky, I'm not able to get .data() working either. The output says 'undefined'. The element I'm passing is $(this).
[13:47:01] <mysphyt> mister_m: That's what .find is for. $(this).find('selector') will find only selectors that are children of $(this).
[13:47:16] <mysphyt> mister_m: Or rather will find descendants of $(this) that match the selector.
[13:47:32] <Dustin> MistuhKurtz: I'm a jQuery newb, is it possible you can give me a simple example on jsfiddle? Just so I can try to get a bit of a better understanding of the process?
[13:49:05] <MistuhKurtz> Dustin, here's an example using the jQuery Cycle plugin (very mature, popular plugin for slideshows and other similar stuff), and it makes use of an "after" callback function: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/after.html
[13:49:40] <mysphyt> Dustin: To be honest, I think rolling your own slider is probably a bit less simple than it sounds for a "jQuery newb." I've been using it for a while, and I think I'd be a bit out of my depth. (In fact, my first thought as to how I'd implement one requires the draggable/droppable classes in JQueryUI, which provides it own slider, and so makes my idea pointless.)
[13:51:34] <Dustin> Hmm, I thought I could just implement a slider, and have a function toggle enable / disable the form, which would be a few lines of code and a few includes. I guess I thought wrong :P
[13:52:06] <mysphyt> Dustin: Have you looked at the slider in JQueryUI? http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[13:52:19] <digs> Okay: http://jsfiddle.net/yEmvm/6/ -- How do I make the new "undo" icon visible when you click the "delete" icon. Also, how do I make the "company" field not 'clickable' until the user clicks the "undo" icon?
[13:53:35] <Dustin> mysphyt: Yes. I was just trying to look at other examples on how to have a function enable to form after dragged 100%
[13:53:39] <mysphyt> Dustin: You can, but the trick is the "few includes". There's no built-in UI widgets in jQuery beyond what the browsers provide, and the browsers don't (currently, mostly) have a built-in slider widget. So you'll need to have a plugin that'll give you a slider widget.
[13:54:42] <mysphyt> Dustin: Gotcha. Hang on a sec, lemme set up a fiddle for you.
[13:56:05] <Dustin> mysphyt: I also wanted to ask, is it ok to include jQuery libraries outside of the header, IE: under the form I'm currently working on? As it's page specific, not included on all pages ?
[13:56:23] <fission6> sorry not sure if someone answered this but i am looking for a snippet of code to take all inputs and replace the input with the value, sort of like a edit and save mode
[14:01:31] <noregret> im append()ing stuff, how can I animate (e.g fade) the appended text ?
[14:02:12] <danheberden> hide it, append it, fadeIn() it
[14:03:03] <mysphyt> Dustin: http://jsfiddle.net/8s5GQ/
[14:03:22] <Dustin> mysphyt: great, I'll take a look.
[14:03:24] <Dustin> Thank you.
[14:03:29] <mysphyt> Dustin: No problem. :)
[14:03:54] <fission6> can i get a text fields input if the form ins't submited yet
[14:04:31] <NoiseEee> $(el).val()
[14:06:04] <noregret> danheberden: hide what ? it only appears after appending
[14:06:46] <danheberden> noregret: you said you wanted to fade it in
[14:06:46] <mysphyt> noregret: You can still hide the content before.
[14:07:07] <danheberden> if you fade in already 100% opacity text that might look silly
[14:07:14] <danheberden> as in not looking at all
[14:07:50] <mysphyt> noregret: b = $('<p>I'm a paragraph!</p>')
[14:08:07] <whatthepoop> anyone have any idea how I might validate input as HTML-formatted (basically, wrapped in a valid HTML element like <p>) using jQuery's validate plugin?
[14:08:17] <mysphyt> noregret: b.hide().appendTo(a).fadeIn()
[14:08:44] <fission6> NoiseEee: if i get a div with input forms inside of it $('div').html() doesn't seem to hav the value set
[14:08:53] <mysphyt> noregret: That way, the actual appending happens while the element is invisible, and then it becomes visible after it gets appended.
[14:09:06] <fission6> i want to transform all inputs to values anyways NoiseEee
[14:09:24] <mysphyt> fission6: $('#thedivinquestion').find('form input[name=whatever]').val()
[14:09:51] <fission6> how can i replace the form input with the value
[14:10:34] <mysphyt> fission6: If you really want to do that, http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[14:11:05] <mysphyt> fission6: But that removes the input from the DOM, and unless you're saving it somewhere, it's just gone.
[14:11:19] <fission6> let me try
[14:11:56] <fission6> oh i am actually creating a new $element = $($('form').html())
[14:12:18] <NoiseEee> fission6: i dunno what you're doing.
[14:12:22] <NoiseEee> fission6: jsfiddle.
[14:13:03] <mysphyt> Dustin: It's pretty common these days to include scripts in the body--in fact, for the most part, it's better, because they load asynchronously, rather than synchronously, as when included in the <head>.
[14:13:07] <noregret> thanks
[14:13:24] <fission6> yea i am not sure what i am doing is "correct"
[14:14:00] <mysphyt> fission6: It sounds like you're probably working too hard. :P Set up a jsfiddle and show us what you're talking about.
[14:15:03] <fission6> trying to think of the easiest fiddle to over its sort of tricky, i want to basically have a user fill a form out - then create a new window and render a filled out form based on their input
[14:15:23] <bahodir> hey guys, how do I get all the data attributes as an object without using .data()?
[14:15:30] <bahodir> Can I do so with .attr()?
[14:17:35] <mysphyt> Dustin: But check out this page, too: http://css-tricks.com/one-two-three/ . He's talking about CSS, but the same efficiency things apply to JS, too. Essentially, if it's a small amount of code, and it shows up on more than one page, you may actually save time by caching it, and by decreasing the number of HTTP requests your page requires, than by just having an extra HTTP request every time the user loads that page. Does that make se
[14:17:55] <mysphyt> bahodir: I don't think so, because jQuery data isn't actually a part of the DOM.
[14:18:10] <mysphyt> bahodir: Why don't you want to use .data()?
[14:19:27] <bahodir> mysphyt, because I'm updating the data attribute, and when I use .data('blah'), it doesn't show me the updated value, but when I do .attr('data-blah') it does
[14:20:16] <mysphyt> bahodir: Those are two different things. Remember, jQuery predates the HTML5 data-xxxx standard, so even though they're both called data, they're not the same set of data.
[14:21:42] <bahodir> mysphyt, why do I get the same value for both before updating then?
[14:23:38] <NoiseEee> bahodir: what do you mean by "it doesn't show me the update value" ?
[14:24:02] <NoiseEee> bahodir: surely when you recall it via .data() it will; if you're asking why don't you see it in the DOM, its because it doesn't write a "data-" attribute
[14:24:50] <bahodir> NoiseEee, so I do $("selector").data('vote_count', 10); and $("selector").data('vote_count'), I don't get 10
[14:25:14] <bahodir> but after updating the data, when I do $("selector").attr("data-vote_count") I do get 10
[14:25:25] <bahodir> NoiseEee, I also see that the dom updates
[14:26:16] <NoiseEee> bahodir: http://jsfiddle.net/J3gcn/
[14:26:58] <Dustin> mysphyt: the example you gave me worked great, only thing is, instead of addclass and removeclass, is there a way to remove "DISABLED" from all the form elements within?
[14:27:13] <eph3meral> so, am I doing something wrong, or is the jquery.svg plugin just, totally fubar? generating an svg with var myFoo = $('#some_div').svg(); myFoo.root(); reports that there is no method root() on the given object
[14:27:20] <eph3meral> http://keith-wood.name/svgRef.html <- quite contrary to the docs
[14:27:35] <eph3meral> like... wtf... how is it that the SVG utility doesn't even conform to it's own docs!?
[14:27:45] <bahodir> NoiseEee, thanks, but that's weird. I need to look into it more, I'm using chrome
[14:27:57] <mysphyt> bahodir: http://jsfiddle.net/34nXN/1/
[14:28:18] <bahodir> mysphyt, thanks
[14:28:26] <mysphyt> bahodir: No problem.
[14:28:59] <mysphyt> Dustin: $('form').children().removeAttr('disabled') should work.
[14:29:15] <eph3meral> "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'root'"
[14:29:22] <eph3meral> how is that even possible, this makes no sense
[14:29:39] <eph3meral> it's a friggin "svg" as returned by the svg lib itself!
[14:30:07] <eph3meral> also, I don't seem to be able to get said svg lib to actually attach to an already existing svg element, it seems that this lib requires 3 svg elements no matter what
[14:32:01] <mysphyt> bahodir: When you say "after updating the data," what do you mean? How are you updating the data?
[14:32:53] <mysphyt> bahodir: Can you give us a fiddle showing the problem?
[14:33:37] <LindsayMac> hey guys. Anyone here have any experience with the waypoints script?
[14:34:35] <bahodir> mysphyt, ok 1 sec
[14:35:39] <Crumbz> Hey guys. How do I determine if a style 'height' is set to auto? .css only returns  the computed style. Thanks.
[14:35:41] <eric_> Can anyone gimme a basic answer as to the difference between "callback" and "callback()" when supplying a function as the callback argument to a jquery event binding?
[14:35:59] <Crumbz> callback is a reference?
[14:36:04] <eric_> yep.
[14:36:06] <Crumbz> to the object
[14:36:15] <Crumbz> callback() is the actual function
[14:36:18] <eric_> to the function
[14:36:40] <mysphyt> Crumbz: Nono--callback is a reference to the function object; callback() executes the function object.
[14:36:49] <Crumbz> console.log(function) && console.log(function()) give two different outputs
[14:36:57] <Crumbz> tes
[14:36:59] <Crumbz> yes*
[14:37:06] <eric_> Ok, so if I supply callback() it essentially always gets called?
[14:37:12] <Crumbz> yes
[14:37:20] <eric_> As it gets executed when the binding / trigger is made?
[14:37:22] <Crumbz> like an anonymouse function, i forget the operator name
[14:37:31] <Crumbz> function() {} () always executes
[14:37:38] <Dustin> mysphyt: http://jsfiddle.net/nDz9D/ - I tried disabled="true" and <input type="" name="" DISABLED />
[14:37:44] <mysphyt> Crumbz: Oops, sorry; I was aiming for eric_ with that comment.
[14:37:49] <Crumbz> ;p
[14:37:55] <Guest37843> I've got a little rollover div that fades in and out on mouseenter and mouseleave. However, the fade in and fade out stack if you roll your mouse over repeatedly, and it produces a sort of flashing effect. How can I get it to ignore any additional mouseenter events until the last mouseleave event has finished? http://jsfiddle.net/kpYQr/
[14:38:07] <eric_> Ahhh ok. I can't get $element.one($.support.transition.end, callback); to work but I can get $element.one($.support.transition.end, callback()); to work.
[14:38:41] <mysphyt> eric_: But essentially that's replacing the whole line with callback() .
[14:38:51] <eric_> Ok that makes perfect sense.
[14:38:57] <eric_> Thank you!!
[14:39:08] <mysphyt> eric_: The first form says, "when this event happens, run this function." The second says, "run this function right now."
[14:39:20] <Crumbz> eric_ that is because youa re passing the function object as an argument. with the () you are telling it to actually execute it
[14:39:35] <mysphyt> eric_: (And if the function returns anything, do that whenever the event happens.)
[14:40:07] <eric_> That's awesome, thanks! I'll have to dig deeper then as to why the callback never gets run.
[14:40:18] <Crumbz> guys, .css() returnes the computed style, how do i determine if height/width is set to auto?
[14:40:19] <mysphyt> eric_: It's essentially the difference between handing someone a gun and shooting them. :P
[14:40:27] <bahodir> mysphyt, when I do it in jsfiddle it works. I guess there's some kind of bug in my code
[14:40:35] <eric_> Wow. That was such a good analogy.
[14:40:40] <eric_> I need to come to this room more often.
[14:40:47] <bahodir> mysphyt, thanks for your help. here is the fiddle i did http://jsfiddle.net/4q3SJ/
[14:40:48] <Crumbz> ;)
[14:40:55] <mysphyt> bahodir: Look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/34nXN/2/
[14:41:28] <Crumbz> guys, .css() returnes the computed style, how do i determine if height/width is set to auto?
[14:41:43] <mysphyt> bahodir: I didn't know this, but it looks like *initially*, jQuery populates an element's .data() with whatever data-blah you have, but after that they're kept separate.
[14:41:46] <bahodir> mysphyt, yes I saw this. it's showing me that attr('data-blah') is not the same as data('blah')
[14:42:24] <bahodir> mysphyt, does that mean what I'm saying makes sense?
[14:42:50] <mysphyt> bahodir: Sorry, I updated it to look at what data('blah') is set to *initially*--and if there is a data-blah attribute, it fills it in based on that. Which is the answer to the question of why they show up the same before you change them, I suspect. Does that makes ensue?
[14:43:00] <mysphyt> bahodir: Lemme take a look at that fiddle.
[14:43:27] <bahodir> mysphyt, yes it seems so. thanks for helping me
[14:43:45] <mysphyt> bahodir: Np. :)
[14:44:15] <vandunk> Could anyone explain to me the reason why this won't work? $(originaltotal).fadeOut("slow").replaceWith(newtotal).fadeIn("slow");
[14:44:38] <Crumbz> what is originaltotal?
[14:44:43] <vandunk> a span
[14:44:51] <vandunk> 'span#cart-total'
[14:45:04] <MistuhKurtz> What's a good, lightweight and mature plugin for mobile swipe events?
[14:45:12] <vandunk> is it trying to fadeIn the originaltotal instead of the newtotal?
[14:45:27] <Crumbz> vandunk, looks like it. i am a newb
[14:45:39] <Crumbz> do the fade in with a callback
[14:46:16] <Crumbz> vandunk, sticl replacewith and fade in with a callback
[14:46:39] <Crumbz> guys how do i determine if a height style property is set to auto?
[14:46:44] <vandunk> sticl?
[14:46:47] <vandunk> i'll try that
[14:46:49] <Crumbz> stick*
[14:46:57] <vandunk> okay
[14:46:59] <vandunk> ahh
[14:47:02] <vandunk> that makes sense
[14:47:05] <Crumbz> :)
[14:47:36] <LindsayMac> So.. I'm using the waypoints.js script and I am pretty certain it is exactly what I need but I have 2 issues. The first is that I can not seem to get a handle on how the scroll up/down works. Ive read some tuts and none seem to be registering with me
[14:48:15] <LindsayMac> here's a link to my basics of my code: http://jsfiddle.net/5et3t/1/
[14:49:30] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone, would it be possible to replace the link to a css with jquery?
[14:49:47] <jarr0dsz> i already replace a full page contents but i need to replace a css also buts in the <head> section would that be a problem?
[14:50:44] <LindsayMac> jarr0dsz:  i am not sure what you are asking, but if you want to add a link to a javascript file and remove a link to a css file, you can do that.
[14:51:01] <vandunk> Thanks a lot Crumbz, got it working.
[14:51:08] <jarr0dsz> LindsayMac: yes that was the idea yes i was to lazy to try ;) its late here ;p
[14:51:11] <Crumbz> vandunk, np. :)
[14:51:37] <Dustin> mysphyt: http://jsfiddle.net/nDz9D/ - I tried disabled="true", disabled="disabled" and <input type="" name="" DISABLED /> (when you get a chance) thanks again.
[14:51:48] <LindsayMac> jarr0dsz:  its kind of a silly question if thats what you are asking. You can't just replace the location because the <link> code for css is different than the <script> to call an external js file
[14:52:45] <jarr0dsz> the idea is to replace <link href="/assets/frontend.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> with something else
[14:52:58] <jarr0dsz> the .css file that is i need that one replaced dynamically so i get a whole new layout + css
[14:53:00] <LindsayMac> jarr0dsz:  yes. replace it with the link to your js code
[14:53:14] <LindsayMac> jarr0dsz: otherwise, you've completely confused me
[14:54:06] <jarr0dsz> normally you would do $('div.second').replaceWith('<h2>New heading</h2>');
[14:54:18] <LindsayMac> yea you lost me
[14:54:28] <jarr0dsz> but the problem is im not sure how to replace the .css file in itselfso instead of having "frontend.css" make it "game.css"
[14:55:00] <Crumbz> hmm, question that has been bugging me, jquery objects are not actual dom elements? but inherited properties/methods etc with in addition jquery methods?
[14:55:04] <mysphyt> jarr0dsz: $('head link[rel=stylesheet').attr('href', 'whatever/the/new/target/is.css') should work?
[14:56:24] <mysphyt> Crumbz: jQuery objects are stored in memory, and they can be added to/removed from the DOM as needed.
[14:56:44] <LindsayMac> So i'm playing with waypoints.js and its pretty perfect, but I need a little help with some more intricate functions I need. I have my code here: http://jsfiddle.net/5et3t/2/
[14:57:00] <jarr0dsz> mysphyt: thx ive tried something like http://pastie.org/private/mq0ckq7ou92ynjn0qg2gw
[14:57:11] <jarr0dsz> i reload the page completely but this seems not to replace the .css file
[14:57:22] <LindsayMac> Right now the code basically adds the class "tall" when you pass by an <article> .. but  now i need to customize it more and i'm stuck.
[14:57:55] <mysphyt> jarr0dsz: You're missing a closing ] in your selector for the link. I'm not sure if it'll work once you fix it, but I'm sure it won't work as is. :P
[14:57:57] <LindsayMac> I need to basically have it 1) only add the class "tall" to a small array of uniquely identified "articles" and I need it to remove that class when you are out of the viewport.. not just when you scroll up
[14:58:21] <jarr0dsz> ah yeah good one missed that i try thx mysphyt
[14:58:31] <mysphyt> Dustin: So how are you disabling the form?
[14:59:17] <fission6> can someone explain why the last line does't give the same results as line 5
[14:59:38] <Dustin> mysphyt: I was just adding disabled="disabled" to each input element, is there an easier way ?
[15:00:02] <LoneStar99> anyone using html5 placeholders?
[15:00:27] <LoneStar99> using the follwing code but for some reason does no placeholders showing up in ie9
[15:00:36] <LoneStar99> http://www.paulund.co.uk/html5-placeholder
[15:02:10] <Dustin> mysphyt: so to have it validate, it's disabled="disabled" (xhtml 1.0 strict).
[15:03:26] <mysphyt> Dustin: Derp, I'm notsobright. I was thinking you were wanting to *enable* the form with the slider; not the other way around.
[15:03:31] <mysphyt> Dustin: Here: http://jsfiddle.net/nDz9D/1/
[15:03:49] <fission6> no ideas? any  unusual stuff iwth textarea.val()
[15:04:42] <Zerpex> Hi guys, when using jquery .load('myfile.php'), can I parse some arguments to that file, in some way? to make it 'dynamic'.. an example is that I send the pageurl to the myfile.php, and when its processed it shows the URL?
[15:04:48] <LindsayMac> So anyone with waypoints experience that can help a newbie out? I'm a fast learner..
[15:05:17] <mysphyt> Dustin: Key things: first, $('form').find('selector') finds all elements that are descendants of a 'form' and that match the selector. $('form').children() only finds the immediate children of the form. (So, since you've got your form elements in a <p>, it doesn't include them--it just includes the <p>.)
[15:05:36] <Dustin> mysphyt: Sorry for the misunderstanding. The form i want disabled by default (all the input fields within it), upon sliding the slider to 100%, it enables all the fields within it.
[15:05:58] <Dustin> but I want it visible, just diabled (input fields) so you cannot input text, till slider is 100%
[15:06:42] <mysphyt> Dustin: You should have everything you need to figure that out. Right?
[15:06:43] <Crumbz> mysphyt, thanks. But doing something like $('#id').id = 'foo'; - doesn't actually do anything. Is this because the selected element is a copy?
[15:06:54] <LindsayMac> Is it possible to trigger a function with waypoints to initiate when you're in a window and then "reverse" when you scroll out. I can only seem to find ways to "undo" the additional of a class when you scroll up
[15:07:33] <fission6> its weird does textarea not get something copied over to it like its value when you use a clone()
[15:07:49] <mysphyt> Crumbz: It's because you're operating on the jQuery element in memory, not the actual HTML element.
[15:07:55] <mysphyt> Crumbz: Hang on a sec.
[15:08:19] <LoneStar99> anyone know a quickfix for lack of placeholder support in IE9?
[15:08:25] <styol> Crumbz: not sure if it will work but another approach might be $('#id').attr('id', 'foo');
[15:08:29] <Dustin> mysphyt: hopefully, I'm a bit confused but I'll keep trying.
[15:08:30] <Dustin> thanks
[15:09:25] <mysphyt> Dustin: Np. Please ask questions if there's a specific part you're confused by, but just having us do it for you probably won't help you much in the long run. :)
[15:09:38] <Dustin> I agree.
[15:10:35] <fission6> why would this not include its value http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9333 ?
[15:11:35] <LindsayMac> anyone have thoughts on this? Is it possible to trigger a function with waypoints to initiate when you're in a window and then "reverse" when you scroll out. I can only seem to find ways to "undo" the additional of a class when you scroll up
[15:12:15] <fission6> im confused why cloning a textarea wouldn't copy the value
[15:12:23] <jarr0dsz> hmmz still reading nobody knows exactly how to rewrite a style.css in head to somethingelse.css ?
[15:13:58] <Dustin> mysphyt: got it, thank you very much for the help.
[15:14:43] <mysphyt> Crumbz: Sorry, I was trying to show this in a fiddle, but it didn't clarify much. The jQuery object doesn't *have* a property called 'id', and so $('#a').id('b') says, "generate a jQuery object using the selector '#a', and give it a new property called 'id' with a value of 'b'." But since nothing uses the jQuery property of 'id', this is essentially the same as saying $('#a').underwear = None.
[15:14:52] <jarr0dsz> found  $('head').append('<link rel="stylesheet" href="style2.css" type="text/css" />'); but that doesent work if i have the jquery in FOOTER should i expect to see a reference to this file in header?
[15:15:19] <jarr0dsz> LindsayMac: your code seems way to complex for the simple features you want, to much lines i mean not possible to make it shorter?
[15:15:37] <LindsayMac> jarr0dsz:  what do you mean?? Which code?
[15:15:46] <jarr0dsz> the jquery code
[15:15:51] <Crumbz> mysphyt, thanks. Just wanted to know if the object i was working on was a dom element or a jquery object
[15:16:04] <LindsayMac> jarr0dsz:  the top code is for the smooth scrolling.. So that isn't part of it. I could remove that.
[15:16:07] <Crumbz> mysphyt, your infor was very useful. thanks. :)
[15:16:12] <mysphyt> Crumbz: Whereas $('#a').attr('id', 'b') says, "Generate a jQuery object based on the selector #a. *Modify the 'id' attribute of the corresponding DOM element to have the value of 'b'." The jQuery object has an API that sits on top of a DOM object, and allows you to manipulate it in certain ways, because the underlying DOM object has different properties/methods based on the browser you're using.
[15:16:57] <mysphyt> Crumbz: Heh. Np. I'll shut up now. :P
[15:17:37] <LindsayMac> jarr0dsz:  really the only code relevent to the add/remove class based on which "container" we are on is just a small portion at the bottom. I added the others in there so you could get an overall idea of what I was trying to do
[15:17:58] <mysphyt> jarr0dsz: If your jQuery code is in the body, and the CSS file is in the header, the browser will load and render the CSS before it loads the jQuery.
[15:19:30] <Crumbz> mysphyt, thanks mate. appreciated. one problem. var obj = $('#id').get(); obj.id = 'test'; .. actually does nothing. i know i should use attr() but get() is suppose to return the actual dom element.
[15:19:32] <mysphyt> jarr0dsz: To tell the truth, I'm almost certain you're approaching this the wrong way. Is there a reason you're not able to modify the actual HTML you're loading with the ajax call?
[15:20:00] <jarr0dsz> hmmz im not that good at jquery somehow it doesent really match my person ;p
[15:20:11] <jarr0dsz> mysphyt: what i do is here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11513420/jquery-replace-the-link-to-style-css-to-game-css
[15:20:14] <Zerpex> anyone here that knows if there is a way to load html via javascript? what I want to do, is if a user hover a link, it should load some html, I know you can load files using the load('file.html'), but can I load specific html?
[15:20:24] <jarr0dsz> mysphyt: im trying to replace the whole page contents wich works + also change the .css
[15:20:32] <jarr0dsz> i need this dynamic layout switching
[15:20:38] <jarr0dsz> its part of a ruby on rails webapp im working on
[15:20:43] <Pumukel> Hi, is there a trick to close an overlay onunload?
[15:20:59] <jarr0dsz> its going to change the world, if you guys can help me with this little part you will be forever part of it ! ;)
[15:21:02] <mysphyt> Crumbz: I think that depends on the javascript APIs provided for the DOM element. It may be that the browser provides id as a readonly property.
[15:21:19] <jarr0dsz> i load whole page contents in var in memory
[15:21:29] <jarr0dsz> i think in that @page var i need to replace the .css
[15:21:34] <jarr0dsz> then write it back to screen
[15:21:55] <mysphyt> jarr0dsz: That's kind of what I mean. If this is a ruby on rails web app, why have the server generate the wrong CSS file and then change it in JS?
[15:22:33] <LindsayMac> jedimind: you still around? I got waypoints working, but I have a couple questions about its capabilities that I cant seem to find the answer to
[15:22:47] <Crumbz> mysphyt, the problem is that i am trying to determine if an objects height style is set to 'auto'; i can't do this with .css() because it returns the computed style only. the only option is to return the actual dom element and do a style.height lookup on it.. is there a jQuery way to somplify this?
[15:23:00] <MistuhKurtz> Is it legal to initialize a variable without assigning a value to it, like: var myVarName;
[15:23:16] <rmurphey> MistuhKurtz: ?tias
[15:23:23] <rmurphey> er, ?tias @ MistuhKurtz
[15:23:29] <MistuhKurtz> I tried it and it didn't throw an error rmurphey
[15:23:30] <rmurphey> oh i'm bad at the bot
[15:23:35] <MistuhKurtz> Yeah me too, haha.
[15:23:38] <rmurphey> but yes, try it and see :)
[15:24:10] <Crumbz> MistuhKurtz, yes it's legal, but it wont have a type.
[15:24:34] <MistuhKurtz> Thanks Crumbz. It's just a scoping thing
[15:24:42] <Crumbz> closure?
[15:24:43] <rmurphey> MistuhKurtz: some people will initialize all of their variables without a value, and then assign values later in the function
[15:24:58] <MistuhKurtz> I need the variable to be able to be accessed outside of the function it's defined in
[15:25:22] <rmurphey> MistuhKurtz: then you need to declare it outside the function
[15:25:28] <MistuhKurtz> right
[15:25:31] <Crumbz> MistuhKurtz, then just initialize it in the scope you want.
[15:26:04] <dabear_> heey rmurphey
[15:26:12] <rmurphey> hello dabear_
[15:26:19] <dabear_> hows it going? any new yayqueries planned?
[15:26:35] <rmurphey> dabear_: i'm afraid that yayquery is on an indefinite hiatus
[15:26:36] <MistuhKurtz> well it's the window width & height and I need to get it on resize, so I just assign it in $(window).resize(function(){ ... }); and then trigger the resize event rather than getting it once on DOM ready and then again whenever resize() occurs
[15:26:45] <dabear_> :(
[15:27:01] * mikkelb is now playing: http://soundcloud.com/niceguyxvinny/birds-thebees (off my new label)
[15:27:52] <mysphyt> Crumbz: Some hours ago, I came in here with more or less the same question. :P
[15:27:58] <LindsayMac> So does anyone know how to make sure that a function is only ran while you are on a specific container and not jut passted over it once using waypoints?
[15:28:09] <Crumbz> mysphyt, what was the answer? :P
[15:28:26] * mikkelb is now playing: http://soundcloud.com/niceguyxvinny/birds-thebees (off my new label)
[15:28:38] <mysphyt> Crumbz: I never found it, sadly. And so now I have to give up and go do laundry in the hopes that my wife isn't furious at me when she comes home. :P
[15:29:03] <Crumbz> mysphyt, ^^ probably a question for stackoverflow. ;p
[15:29:10] <dabear_> LindsayMac: what does that even mean?
[15:29:21] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  are you familiar with waypoints.js?
[15:29:33] <dabear_> nop
[15:29:53] <LindsayMac> Ok well that would explain.. I am working with this plugin: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/#waypoints-viewport-height
[15:30:16] <LindsayMac> basically what it does is it will run a function when, while scrolling, you reach a specific page / div container on the page.
[15:30:46] <dabear_> passted=?
[15:30:47] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  what I am trying to do is have a small div container expand and contract on different areas of the page, based on where you are in the scroll..
[15:30:51] <LindsayMac> yea hold on
[15:31:14] <Crumbz> dabear_, passed*
[15:31:39] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  this is the code that I am working with. This includes the quick smoothscroll function I was using as well, so you can ingnore that part if you dont feel its useful. The code to initiate the expansion of the #white-box is at the bottom http://jsfiddle.net/5et3t/2/
[15:32:19] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  just so you know.. I am new to javascript, but I do know php/html/css well.. So I am learning, but a little clueless. I am (in my opnion) a relatively fast learning though
[15:32:40] <jarr0dsz> mysphyt the rails app cannot change it it needs to be done in realtime, there is no reload of page
[15:32:41] <MistuhKurtz> to increment a value inside animate(), can I do something like animate({ left: +200});
[15:33:10] <dabear_> so you want to do something when a user scrolls to an element and stays on that element for a couple of seconds?
[15:33:50] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  yes... and then "undo" that same something when they scroll away (either up or down).
[15:34:08] <LindsayMac> The issue I have come in to, however, is that I want the same element animated differently based on where you are on the page.
[15:34:17] <vandunk> Is there a way to fadeIn but set display: inline instead of display: block?
[15:34:34] <LindsayMac> Because I have been able to animate content based on where you are on the page in the scroll, but NOT multiple different ways for the same element dabear_
[15:35:11] <vandunk> $('.class').fadeIn(1000); $('.class').css("display","inline"); doesn't work. .class appears without fading in
[15:35:19] <dabear_> so something like the hoverintent plugin?
[15:35:40] <LindsayMac> Im not familiar with that. I'm gonna go google reeally quick dabear_
[15:36:10] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  i dont want to do anything with a mouse hover ...
[15:36:16] <LindsayMac> has nothing to do with that, in fact.
[15:37:00] <LindsayMac> unless there's something on a page somewhere that I am missing
[15:37:01] <dabear_> so when an element is in view, and page has not scrolled, you wanna fire a callback?
[15:37:34] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  let me show you a quick screenshot really quick
[15:38:39] <dabear_> oh, I think I get it now
[15:38:48] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  as you can see from the html I have in that paste, I have a bunch of <articles> on top of each other. I have a smooth scroll that alloes you to scroll from one another
[15:39:17] <LindsayMac> So let's say i'm on the "home" container and I want to scroll to container 6.
[15:39:25] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  first, the home page would load like this.. http://cl.ly/image/460X1h3I2t29
[15:39:27] <dabear_> LindsayMac: on the waypoint, use a settimout that will call some code after one sec. also bind to window scrolling, and cancel that timeout if the window scrolls
[15:39:38] <dabear_> see ?settimeout
[15:39:39] <bot-t> var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[15:40:08] <LindsayMac> dabear_: .. I just wanna make sure you "get" what i'm saying.. just to be sure
[15:40:46] <LindsayMac> So when i scroll to article 6. i would be passing by 2,3,4, etc... to get there.. And when I do finally get there, I would like to have teh #white-box expand like this: cl.ly/image/1o3W0Y1R092F
[15:41:33] <dabear_> yep, so you wanna just do that when page is stationary
[15:41:35] <LindsayMac> However,  I would also have #white-box expand on article 2 becuase that one may also have some content with a lot of text.. So important, I only want to initiate this when we "rest" On that container.
[15:41:38] <dabear_> then my solution would work
[15:41:39] <LindsayMac> right..
[15:41:51] <LindsayMac> but I also need to remove it when you scroll away.. right now it only removes the class when I scroll up.
[15:42:16] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  so now I am going to look up how to do those things you mentioned ;0
[15:42:23] <dabear_> bind to $(window).scroll(function(){ remove class here and clear timeout})
[15:42:47] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  btw, thanks for taking the time to figure this out with me
[15:43:10] <dabear_> yep, my fee is 10000 USD / hour
[15:43:11] <LindsayMac> So i probably don't need the if up / if down anymore..
[15:43:20] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  do you take credit cards
[15:43:42] <dabear_> nah, cash only, delivered personally
[15:44:05] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  ok.. as soon as I get this working i'll pack up myself and my heels (in hopes of a discount)
[15:44:39] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  i'm still not certain on how to integrate your suggestion with my code, i'm going to have to look it up before I can test.
[15:44:46] <afahim> <afahim> hey, anyone here familiar with how jquery UI tabs were coded up?
[15:44:47] <afahim> <afahim> I wanna ask how do the tabs resize themselves to fit the format (size, font, etc) of the text that the tabs hold
[15:44:47] <afahim> <afahim> as in how do the tab width and height change according to the format of the text contained in the tab heading
[15:44:47] <afahim> <afahim> is it done using CSS or some sort of programming
[15:45:12] <LindsayMac> afahim:  i am pretty sure thats just css
[15:45:20] <afahim> ok thanks
[15:46:13] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  is this correct?
[15:46:17] <LindsayMac> https://gist.github.com/9f1eab45e1923d14c036
[15:46:19] <dabear_> LindsayMac: when the waypoint is reached, just add a foo = setTimeout(onStationaryWaipoint, 1000)
[15:46:39] <dabear_> on window scroll, cancel any timeouts
[15:46:57] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  ... you're talking to a compelte js newbie here..
[15:47:02] <dabear_> and define that function onStationaryWaipoint
[15:47:20] <LindsayMac> I'm sorry.. i HATE feeling like an idiot!
[15:47:40] <LindsayMac> I feel like I can do anything with php.. but toss me into javascript and i'm a complete doaf
[15:47:50] <LindsayMac> basically googling all the words you're using .. ha
[15:48:04] <dabear_> hm, 1) is that a mistyping+
[15:48:04] <dabear_> ?
[15:48:21] <LindsayMac> huh?
[15:48:24] <dabear_> line 1
[15:48:30] <dabear_> makes no sense, not valid js
[15:48:45] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  thats what I was afraid of..
[15:48:49] <LindsayMac> as I said.. i'm learning as I go with this one..
[15:49:00] <LindsayMac> googling and testing. thats the only way I can figure it out..
[15:49:11] <LindsayMac> Unless i find a good exampel to work within and dissect
[15:49:42] <dabear_> maybe http://css-tricks.com/scrollfollow-sidebar/
[15:49:51] <dabear_> Haven't checked it out myself though
[15:51:16] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  reading now..
[15:51:23] <LindsayMac> gosh i hate this! I feel so behind
[15:52:16] <dabear_> no worries
[15:52:29] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  so just so I can understand the "order" in which things would take place. You are thinking that I add the window scroll "check" before I actually initiate the function right?
[15:52:31] <dabear_> that page assumes that you're not using any waitpoints though
[15:52:59] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  i can USUALLY mash two concepts together pretty well.. like, i know i cant just copy and paste that..
[15:53:10] <LindsayMac> I think my issue is that understanding the order in which I need to iniate these things.
[15:53:11] <dabear_> depends what you mean by "check". we call it binding ot an event
[15:53:36] <dabear_> ok, assuming you have the waypoints working, right?
[15:53:45] <LindsayMac> First I need to initiate the waypoint.. So when i get to article, wait 5 seconds and then initiate function addClass
[15:53:48] <LindsayMac> is that correct?
[15:54:13] <LindsayMac> So the window scroll event should be measured within the waypoint correct? Not before it.
[15:54:32] <dabear_> measured? no
[15:54:47] <LindsayMac> Maybe im using the wrong words..
[15:54:51] <dabear_> ok, think of it like this
[15:55:35] <dabear_> when a page is scrolled into an element (that's what the waypoints do), you wanna add some code that shows another element( .addClass or whatever)
[15:55:49] <dabear_> so you do that first
[15:55:49] <LindsayMac> correct..
[15:56:21] <LindsayMac> Ok makes sense.. its KINDA what I was trying to say, just using the wrong words
[15:56:22] <dabear_> don't bother with having to be stationary over an elment, just focus on the scrolled to part
[15:56:42] <Shai-Tan> I have a datepicker in a ui modal box. I have set the datepicker to z-index to 9999 and it shows fine. However, the year and month dropdowns do not show above the datepicker. How can I set these to be above the datepicker?
[15:57:10] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  well the scroll to part is already there.. the waypoint knows to add the class when you scroll.
[15:57:11] <Shai-Tan> to set the datepicker z-index I use $("#ui-datepicker-div").css("z-index", "9999");
[15:57:24] <dabear_> LindsayMac: let me see it?
[15:57:25] <LindsayMac> if it's ok, I can PM you with a link. I would just need you IP to give you access
[15:57:30] <LindsayMac> lol.. great minds
[15:58:01] <dabear_> ok, hurry a bit, it's getting late
[15:59:22] <LindsayMac> dabear_:  ok done
[16:10:13] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:11:42] <dabear_> mfoxdogg|work: g'night

[16:26:32] <io__> hi i need a very simple CMS to build content for a jquery based site, what s your advice here?
[16:30:23] <LindsayMac> io__: i like wordpress as a CMS personally..
[16:34:54] <io__> LindsayMac: i use drupal but i need something lightweight that can serve pages in html  no heavy php code
[16:35:05] <io__> so jquery can load stuff quickly
[16:35:26] <LindsayMac> io__:  i dont understand at all..
[16:35:33] <zsoc> yeah that pretty much makes 0 sense to me
[16:35:59] <LindsayMac> io__:  javascript can load stuff even more quickly with a php framework
[16:36:59] <io__> LindsayMac: why? if i need to load a div from a URL isn t it faster if the html file is already written instead of having being parsed by php?
[16:38:28] <LindsayMac> io__:  then you dont have any content management..
[16:40:53] <io__> LindsayMac: my idea is using a CMS to build the infrastracture then render it to plain html (it is a static site,after development)
[16:41:09] <LindsayMac> io__:  that makes no sense to me.
[16:41:10] <shoky> wat
[16:41:11] <b-ot> What is this, I don't even...
[16:41:21] <LindsayMac> LOL i am glad I am not the only one
[16:41:53] <shoky> io__: using a CMS means you have content (that can be changed) , meaning it is a _dynamic_ site
[16:42:09] <opalelement> greetings
[16:42:10] <shoky> if the content cant be changed, you dont need no stinkin CMS :P
[16:42:34] <opalelement> ive got a question that i hope some fo you may be able to help with, im new to jquery and cant find anything about it when searching...
[16:43:02] * shoky throws opalelement a beer
[16:43:05] <LindsayMac> opalelement:  you cant find a THING about jquery on the interwebs?
[16:43:24] <opalelement> im trying to bind a focusin to a div but tii doesn't seem to trigger when teh div is focused, i can only seem to get focusin to recognize the focus of the div in question
[16:43:33] <opalelement> lindsaymac not what i meant lol i mean about my issue
[16:43:40] <LindsayMac> haha i know. Iwas joking
[16:43:51] <opalelement> that last part was supposed to say of textboxes
[16:44:03] <morguaii> ne1 playing w/ knockoutjs?
[16:44:06] <opalelement> focusin works on textboxes but doesn't seem to work for divs
[16:44:08] <shoky> morguaii yep
[16:44:25] <io__> sorry my server is down i ll be back later
[16:44:45] <opalelement> is there an alternate method to use for checking focus of divs?
[16:46:00] <LindsayMac> Has anyone played around with this: vertstudios.com/blog/jquery-sticky-scroller-position-fixed-plugin/
[16:47:15] <opalelement> anyone know a way to do what i mentioned?
[16:47:16] <LindsayMac> I'm desperately trying to figure out how to change the height of a div that is fixed to the top of my page based on which div "panel" you are on..
[16:47:24] <LindsayMac> I have a single page-like layout
[16:49:58] <LindsayMac> if anyone has experience with waypoints.js iyou could be of HUGE help  to me
[16:50:44] <LekeFly> Is it possible to search a <td> that contains the text "subtotal" then remove the entire <td></td> if it exists?
[16:51:04] <LekeFly> Or a tr..*
[16:52:20] <shoky> LekeFly: $('td:contains(subtotal)').remove()
[16:54:08] <LindsayMac> I'm having a HECK of a time with this sticky "menu"... if anyone has guidance for how to use waypoints more efficiently, i am in need
[16:54:08] <LekeFly> shoky: Thanks! exactly what i was looking for.. never tought it would have been that easy :P
[16:56:47] <LindsayMac> My issue is that I need to initiate an "animation" or an addClass to the same element multiple times withint he scroll
[17:01:48] <azbyin> hi all. i am currently randomly creating circular divs on clicking anywhere within the body
[17:16:48] <azbyin> http://jsfiddle.net/HSD9T/
[17:17:30] <azbyin> that code has an issue where if more than one div has been placed (multiple clicks anywhere on body) within the 1 second timeout, only the last one gets removed.
[17:18:57] <pachet> i doubt you want to hear the very long, very complicated story about scope resolution and implicit eval that is resulting in the behavior you see here
[17:19:11] <pachet> so suffice it to say that passing a string to setTimeout is bad mojo in 98% of cases
[17:20:55] <pachet> azbyin: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/SC6nC/
[17:21:36] <azbyin> pachet, looking now
[17:22:00] <azbyin> right, you simply made it a closure
[17:32:18] <LaFlamaBlanca> does .offset() take into account padding/borders/margin on an element
[17:32:40] <LaFlamaBlanca> in other words, does it give you the coordinate based on the content box or the whole box
[17:33:01] <LaFlamaBlanca> and from which point of the container does it start: margin, padding, content
[17:33:13] <pachet> well, first of all, offset() is relative to the document
[17:33:54] <pachet> so there's no margin or padding or anything added to the 0,0 'container' starting coord
[17:34:14] <LaFlamaBlanca> my bad
[17:34:17] <LaFlamaBlanca> i meant position
[17:34:20] <LaFlamaBlanca> for all of those
[17:34:28] <pachet> oh i see
[17:34:38] <pachet> well, it doesn't take into account the parent margin
[17:34:51] <LaFlamaBlanca> so starts from parent padding?
[17:35:42] <pachet> yes
[17:36:34] <LaFlamaBlanca> pachet: cool. and does it give you the coordinate of the childs margin, padding, or content box edge
[17:36:52] <pachet> content box
[17:37:10] <pachet> so top left border, if there is one
[17:37:50] <LaFlamaBlanca> cool so no margins
[17:40:04] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. im looking for some "advanced" help with the waypoints.js plugin. I am trying to animated one element multiple times on a page..
[17:40:27] <LindsayMac> but I am trying to make it so that the animation only starts after you stop on the element for a moment.
[17:40:48] <pachet> by stop on you mean keep your mouse over?
[17:41:35] <LindsayMac> pachet:  no.. I am using a smooth scroll .. So when you click a link, it will scroll you t the location you need and THEN after the scrolling stopped to initiate the animation
[17:42:16] <LindsayMac> The reason I need this is because if I bind an animation to every div inbetween point a and point b, it will trigger ALL of them as I go from point a to b .. I want to only trigger it when you know th euser is stopping to read
[17:42:20] <LindsayMac> does that make sense?
[17:43:09] <pachet> LaFlamaBlanca: i made a fiddle, just for clarity:
[17:43:11] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/KhDWJ/
[17:43:12] <LindsayMac> pachet:  my page is basically like a single page website layout where i have <article> tags that contain erach page content.
[17:43:48] <LindsayMac> pachet:  here's my fiddle (althug it doesnt work in there, it does on my site) http://jsfiddle.net/5et3t/2/
[17:44:51] <LindsayMac> I basically have a background element that is fixed to the top of the page and only want it to expand when there is content in a div that I scrolled to.
[17:46:06] <pachet> LindsayMac: ok looking, one sec
[17:46:24] <LindsayMac> pachet:  thanks.. I would be happy to give you the link but i would need your IP to make it accessable to you
[17:48:24] <Shai-Tan> I have a datepicker in a ui modal box. I have set the datepicker to z-index to 9999 and it shows fine. However, the year and month dropdowns do not show above the datepicker. How can I set these to be above the datepicker?
[17:49:42] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan:  you should check the z-index for those.. if its set
[17:49:54] <Shai-Tan> to set the datepicker z-index I use $("#ui-datepicker-div").css("z-index", "9999");
[17:50:19] <Shai-Tan> but when I set the z-index of the year and month dropdowns, no change
[17:50:50] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan:  do they have a position set? relative, etc.
[17:51:14] <LindsayMac> You can also set it to inheret
[17:51:20] <LindsayMac> so z-index:inherit
[17:51:29] <Shai-Tan> will try inherit
[17:52:02] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan:  make sure to also set the position on the container for your drop downs as well..
[17:52:18] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan:  why exactly did you need to set your z0index like that? Is there something that is overwriting it?
[17:52:36] <Shai-Tan> the datepicker is in a form which is in a modal box
[17:52:40] <Shai-Tan> jquery ui modal
[17:53:00] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan:  ok
[17:53:45] <Shai-Tan> setting relative, and inherit does not change it
[17:53:46] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan:  you SHOULD be able to simply give the container of your date picker a position:relative and it should have the z-index of the model container inherit it's z-index.. i believe..
[17:54:01] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan:  can I see a link?
[17:54:22] <Shai-Tan> it is not live, only in dev
[17:54:25] <Shai-Tan> $("#ui-datepicker-div").css("position", "relative");
[17:54:33] <Shai-Tan> that sets the div to relative
[17:55:16] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan:  so when you look at the output you have #ui-datepicker-div { Position:relative, z-index:inherit;}
[17:55:54] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan:  what about the container for just the drop downs (the element that is not showing)
[17:56:29] <Shai-Tan> LindsayMac: I have tried to set the containers for the dropdowns, by nothing seems to affect them
[17:56:36] <Shai-Tan> its like they are z-index proof
[17:56:54] <LindsayMac> Shai-Tan: I dont really know what to say. can you post the html structure in jsfiddle ?
[17:57:24] <Shai-Tan> sec
[17:58:56] <tw2113> braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaains
[17:59:09] <Shai-Tan> hmm http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4363

[18:01:43] <sqpat17> i have a bunch of identical divs with an element inside that i want to show/hide on their hovers. But i only want to show the one inside of that specific div and not the one inside of all the identical divs. Is there some way to use "this" within the jquery callback to do this?
[18:05:56] <LindsayMac> can any of the elements have a unique id added to them?
[18:06:40] <sqpat17> i suppose i can, but then that'd be a lot of copy/paste on selectors
[18:07:03] <sqpat17> im looking thru the documentation, i think $(this).find(".someClass") might work actually
[18:07:22] <sqpat17> within the callback, where this would refer to the DOM element
[18:08:29] <sqpat17> ok, that did it actually
[18:08:51] <sqpat17> sorry, it had been a couple years since i'd used jquery... i knew there was a way to do this, just couldn't remember how.
[18:09:57] <LindsayMac> good point johnkpaul-afk

[18:20:15] <digipol> oh thats a much better approch, thank you so much @shoky
[18:20:44] <shoky> now gimme some brainzz
[18:21:51] <Styles2304> Anyone available for a quick look at a problem?
[18:22:01] <shoky> everyone is
[18:22:06] <Styles2304> lol ok
[18:22:08] <Styles2304> http://www.codingforums.com/showthread.php?p=1251909#post1251909
[18:23:03] <shoky> is that img in the DOM tree on page load?
[18:24:03] <Styles2304> No, it's not
[18:24:08] <Styles2304> is that the issue?
[18:24:12] <shoky> yes
[18:24:49] <shoky> either bind the click handler after its already in the DOM, or use event delegation - delegate the event handling to a container element, see ?on
[18:24:49] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:25:19] <Styles2304> Alright thanks
[18:25:24] <Styles2304> exactly what I was looking for
[18:26:37] <LindsayMac> I am at the point right now where i am willing to pay someone to do this for me
[18:27:01] <morficus> did somebody say pay?  :-p
[18:28:59] <LindsayMac> haha..
[18:29:07] <LindsayMac> well.. javascript gives me a dern headache. I like my php better
[18:29:34] <coldhead> may god help you
[18:29:39] <LindsayMac> lol...
[18:29:45] <LindsayMac> is javascript THAT bad
[18:29:52] <shoky> its an pretty kewl
[18:29:54] <LindsayMac> wait.. why am I asking THAT question.. iknow the answer to it
[18:30:09] <tw2113> ask some people, php is that bad too
[18:30:25] <LindsayMac> oh hai tw2113
[18:30:26] <javalover> hi
[18:30:45] <tw2113> braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaains
[18:30:47] <morficus> nuh uh
[18:31:14] <digipol> braaaaaains, i would share brains with you, but i'm a junior develpoer in a company with none.
[18:31:21] <javalover> i have a zindex issue
[18:31:34] <morficus> sounds like you should fix that
[18:31:38] * LindsayMac eats brains.. ask tw2113 .. he'll tell ya 
[18:31:38] <tw2113> i want brains, i come here
[18:31:40] <morficus> it also sounds like a CSS problem
[18:31:40] <javalover> heres my problem, i have this dark shade thing i'm using as an overlay div to my images
[18:31:48] <tw2113> if i wanted just mindless zombies, i'd go to #css
[18:31:55] <javalover> but when i make the div higher then the images behind it
[18:32:05] <javalover> i can no longer have rollover effects on stuff behind the div
[18:32:11] <abjorn> coldhead: HAY HAY HAY
[18:32:17] <javalover> so how do I penetrate an existing div for rollovers?
[18:32:22] <morficus> javalover: well yeah... because you have an overlay div ONTOP of it
[18:32:37] <LindsayMac> javalover:  i dont think you can do that
[18:32:37] <tomoyuki28jp> How can we dynamically add ajax data with ajaxSetup?
[18:32:38] <javalover> yeah how can I bypass this?
[18:33:01] <digipol> position: relative? do you have a pastie we could look at?
[18:33:04] <shoky> she must be fugly if you wanna bypass penetration
[18:33:12] <javalover> hmmm
[18:33:13] <LindsayMac> LMAO
[18:33:17] <digipol> heh
[18:33:17] <javalover> lemme try
[18:33:26] <morficus> javalover: you will have to dynamically look for the element it's overlaid on and manaully apply the hover class
[18:33:29] <morficus> or
[18:33:31] <morficus> remove the overlay
[18:34:48] <javalover> well relative doesn't work
[18:34:51] <javalover> i need the overlay...
[18:35:08] <javalover> how does one dynamically look for an element?
[18:36:43] <LindsayMac> javalover:  sometimes you THINK you need things, but you dont. What purpose does your overlay serve?
[18:37:01] <javalover> i'm doing an animation thing
[18:37:09] <javalover> and it isolates everything so it's darkened out
[18:37:17] <LindsayMac> that still doesnt really answer the question..
[18:37:38] <javalover> ok so it's like this [1][2][3]
[18:37:51] <javalover> and then when i highlight 1, 2 and 3 become darkened by the overlay which is behind 1
[18:38:19] <javalover> but then I want to overlay on 2 instead....and it doesn't work, now I can reset everything but if I do that, it causes a glitch.
[18:38:32] <javalover> and the glitch is like this illuminating & dealumminating light & it's really annoying
[18:39:11] <javalover> so i want it to be once you overlay, the overlay shows up but then you can still highlight stuff behind the overlay swapping inbetween layers
[18:39:44] <javalover> it's possible i've found something that is beyond javascripts limitations lol
[18:41:10] <LindsayMac> javalover:  could you make like a css image map type thing where you have an anchor element that is basically empty but has a height and width and position of your elements that are underneath but a z-index of +whatever your overlay is ?
[18:41:26] <javalover> i am going to read that
[18:41:31] <LindsayMac> lol
[18:41:35] <javalover> but i went to kitchen to get pasta & thought of just making invisible boxes
[18:41:42] <javalover> is that what you wrote?
[18:41:45] <LindsayMac> yea basically
[18:41:50] <javalover> yeah that's solution lol
[18:41:53] <LindsayMac> inivisible boxes using CSS
[18:42:08] <javalover> yup completely solves it
[18:42:09] <javalover> awesome
[18:42:13] <LindsayMac> great minds ;)
[18:42:21] <LindsayMac> now if only i can make my stupid idea work.
[18:42:26] <javalover> great minds :-)~
[18:42:31] <javalover> what's the issue?
[18:42:34] <LindsayMac> now I may have found something thats a stretch for JS
[18:42:35] <LindsayMac> haha
[18:42:42] <LindsayMac> its a LONG story.. werent you going to get pasta?
[18:42:50] <javalover> no i have it...
[18:42:55] <LindsayMac> haha ok..
[18:43:00] <javalover> so lay it on me
[18:43:12] <LindsayMac> well pachet is trying something now, but couldnt hurt to have someone else think about it
[18:43:16] <javalover> and btw SHOKY PAY ATTENTION!!!
[18:43:23] <javalover> kk go
[18:43:56] <LindsayMac> I have a single-page style website where my "pages" are just <article> tags stacked on top of each other and a smooth scroll to get to each box..
[18:43:59] <LindsayMac> make sense so far?
[18:44:24] <javalover> sorta
[18:44:28] <LindsayMac> I have a block fixed to the top of the browser so that no matter where i scroll, this box is there.
[18:44:38] <javalover> yup
[18:45:07] <LindsayMac> So I want to take this box that is fixed to the top, and change the height of it depending on which div I scrolled to.
[18:45:23] <LindsayMac> basically so far, waypoints.js does this.. I can set a function to fire when I view a specific container
[18:45:44] <javalover> mmhmm'
[18:46:39] <LindsayMac> what it doesnt do is let you "unset" a class I just added when the div goes out of view
[18:46:55] <javalover> code it yourself
[18:46:56] <tw2113> toggleClass()
[18:46:58] <javalover> don't rely on waypoints
[18:47:14] <javalover> i went through what you're describing and ended up just coding it myself
[18:47:16] <LindsayMac> javalover:  i am totally NOT that good at js
[18:47:17] <javalover> it was super easy
[18:47:21] <javalover> no it's so simple
[18:47:28] <javalover> whatever the condition is just code it like that
[18:47:36] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  toggle class works but waypoints doesnt seem to have a way to know when they div is out of the viewport
[18:47:39] <javalover> so if(mydiv.container.x < 5){
[18:47:41] <javalover> something like that
[18:47:55] <javalover> yeah check for it yourself
[18:48:19] <LindsayMac> javalover:  you arent making sense to me
[18:48:28] <javalover> ok so
[18:48:38] <javalover> the only way we'd know if something is out of a viewport
[18:48:42] <javalover> is by checking it's x & y coordinate
[18:48:54] <javalover> so check those & see if they're out of the current viewport
[18:49:22] <javalover> along with it's height & width if you want to be precise
[18:49:30] <LindsayMac> javalover:  the reason I work within existing plugins is that i'm not that good ;)
[18:49:41] <javalover> it's so easy though
[18:49:58] <javalover> ok so you know how you have Top: Left: etc?
[18:50:06] <LindsayMac> yea
[18:57:41] <digs> http://jsfiddle.net/yEmvm/12/ -- Can anyone think of a better way to do this so that I don't have to use opacity so the 'undo' icon can be seen clearly in full color after clicking the 'delete' icon.
[18:57:44] <culpn8r> i am trying to use jquery raty plugin in a code igniter view. can someone show me how to use it? i am having trouble getting the required files to include in the php page
[19:02:51] <digipol> @digs i'd create the delete icon outside of the div you want to fade out and give it a negative top margin
[19:07:28] <kevin_> hi all. quick question. i've got a pretty big ajax call that sends base64-encoded data to the server. is there a way i can get what percent complete the outgoing ajax call is?
[19:07:33] <digs> digipol, I don't know. I don't see that workin nor can I get it to work.
[19:10:03] <morficus> kevin_: what?
[19:10:13] <morficus> do you mean you want to know how much of that data has been uplaoded?
[19:10:30] <kevin_> morficus: yeah. sorry if i didn't phrase that right
[19:14:48] <jedimind> does .replace only replace the first instance when it matches it in the string ?
[19:14:56] <jedimind> thats what it appears to be doing
[19:15:23] <jedimind> $this.attr('rel', $this.text().replace(' ', '-')); is only replacing the first space in the string with a -
[19:15:47] <rmurphey> jedimind: you can pass flags, but it is "non-standard"
[19:15:49] <rmurphey> not sure what support is
[19:15:51] <rmurphey> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[19:16:23] <rmurphey> you can probably also do .replace(/\s/g, '-')
[19:17:01] <morficus> kevin_: are you familiar with deferreds?
[19:17:03] <tw2113> hi everybodys
[19:17:08] <trakinas> night folks! using jquery 1.6.7: I have 6 elements that shares the same css class. they dont have IDs.  is it possible to use toggle() on a hover effect over them? if so, how? I tired using jquery(this), but it toggled for all them.
[19:17:10] <morficus> deferred and promise?
[19:17:51] <tw2113> .on() doesn't work with hover does it?
[19:17:51] <rmurphey> ?fiddle @ trakinas
[19:17:53] <bot-t> trakinas, #10785 (jQuery .html().replace breaks in IE7-8 only. Example fiddle ... - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10785
[19:18:01] <rmurphey> fuuuu sorry trakinas
[19:18:11] <rmurphey> what i was trying to say was, can you put together a jsfiddle?
[19:18:25] <eternalsword> tw2113: it should
[19:19:01] <trakinas> rmurphey: I will upload it to a test server. one sec.
[19:19:02] <tw2113> just for personal reference .on('hover') vs .hover()
[19:19:13] <kevin_> morficus: doesn't ring a bell...
[19:19:37] <rmurphey> trakinas: easiest if you can just put together a very simple demonstration in a fiddle
[19:19:43] <rmurphey> that way we don't have to wade through all of your code
[19:20:07] <trakinas> okay!
[19:20:40] <rmurphey> trakinas: for example, http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/cx3hk/
[19:21:44] <eternalsword> tw2113: turns out I lied.  .hover() is an alias for .on('mouseenter').on('mouseleave') not .on('hover')
[19:22:21] <eternalsword> or at least has the same effect as that.
[19:23:20] <mdeboard> Is e.g. $(".foo .bar .baz") a multiple selector like the docs say $(".foo, .bar, .baz") would be?
[19:23:22] <tw2113> in the end, it sounds like either will be fine
[19:23:24] <mdeboard> that is, are the commas optional
[19:23:43] <rmurphey> mdeboard: no, the commas are not optional
[19:23:48] <rmurphey> no more than the commas are optional in css
[19:24:06] <rmurphey> that is, in css, .foo .bar .baz has a different meaning than .foo, .bar, .baz
[19:24:12] <mdeboard> I see.
[19:24:37] <mdeboard> $(".a .b .c") == ".c in .b in .a" then?
[19:24:47] <kevin_> morficus: guess i'll start googling there?
[19:24:50] <rmurphey> yes
[19:25:11] <mdeboard> oic http://api.jquery.com/descendant-selector/
[19:25:29] <rmurphey> kevin_: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/ may be helpful, not sure what you are working on
[19:25:31] <morficus> kevin_: the $.ajax() method in jquery returns a deferred object. deferreds have various callbacks (done, fail, etc)
[19:25:44] <morficus> one of those callbacks is "progress"
[19:25:46] <morficus> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.progress/
[19:26:03] <morficus> not 100% sure if it will get you the data you are looking for... but it's a place to start I thnk
[19:27:57] <kevin_> alright i'll check that out. thanks
[19:29:31] <LindsayMac> i dislike javascript... why cant it be simple like php is
[19:29:51] <rmurphey> LindsayMac: it's much simpler than php, eventually
[19:30:06] <LindsayMac> i find that hard to beleive!!! There's too much that can go wrong..
[19:30:07] <rmurphey> unlike php, it does require that you .. learn it :)
[19:30:09] <digipol> yeah i gotta agree thre is simpler that php
[19:30:09] <LindsayMac> and math...
[19:30:20] <digipol> than*
[19:30:21] <rmurphey> but there is not a ton to learn
[19:30:35] <LindsayMac> iguess that gives me a little hope that if I can learn php i can eventually learn this?
[19:30:35] <rmurphey> LindsayMac: have you spent any time with a resource like http://eloquentjavascript.net/?
[19:30:39] <trakinas> rmurphey: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/u7gVA/
[19:31:02] <LindsayMac> rmurphey:  in fact, i have..
[19:31:04] <rmurphey> trakinas: that doesn't seem to have any javascript :)
[19:31:17] <digipol> ifound php harder to learn than javascript, javascript has pretty loose syntax requirements making it easy to stumble around where you first start learning
[19:31:23] <trakinas> but there are. hehe! let me repost
[19:31:39] <rmurphey> trakinas: also that is using 1.5.2?
[19:31:47] <LindsayMac> digipol:  i think thats why I have issues with it. I like strict. One basic way to make things happen
[19:31:55] <mdeboard> could jQuery's .data() method simulate a 'click' event? I'm referring to the out-of-the-box definition of .dat() method
[19:32:04] <mdeboard> data*
[19:32:05] <trakinas> rmurphey: no, 1.6.7
[19:32:08] <digipol> yeah i can understand that
[19:32:33] <trakinas> http://jsfiddle.net/u7gVA/1/
[19:32:35] <rmurphey> trakinas: http://d.pr/i/uHrm
[19:34:18] <trakinas> rmurphey: so, how do I save it and share? I dont see something like "publish", just run. I see the share button, which gave me the link above.
[19:34:35] <rmurphey> trakinas: so, the parent of div.ngg-album-compact seems to be div.ngg-albumoverview
[19:34:52] <rmurphey> which, when you find .ngg-album-compact h4 in it
[19:34:55] <rmurphey> results in two h4's
[19:35:09] <tw2113> ewww, nextgen gallery
[19:35:25] <LindsayMac> not a fan of ngg either
[19:35:44] <rmurphey> trakinas: why not just jQuery(this).find('h4') ?
[19:35:44] <trakinas> tw2113: [off] it was ngg or build something from scratch, which I dont have time to.
[19:35:59] <trakinas> rmurphey: let me try.
[19:36:07] <rmurphey> also, you will *always* regret things like .parent().parent().parent()
[19:36:48] <morficus> yes :-(
[19:37:00] <morficus> why not use parents('.someClassName')
[19:37:07] <rmurphey> however, i don't see where that code is even being used
[19:37:26] <rmurphey> that is, i don't see anything that matches div.ngg-thumbnail
[19:38:22] <rmurphey> trakinas: whenever something is not doing what you expect, you should log the result of the selection you've made, and see whether it is what you expected
[19:38:37] <trakinas> rmurphey: I tested with .find("h4") locally and it worked. thanks!
[19:38:54] <rmurphey> trakinas: http://jsfiddle.net/Wvfbq/
[19:38:55] <trakinas> rmurphey: all right
[19:39:05] <rmurphey> see how i've logged the selection of the h4's?
[19:39:16] <rmurphey> and see how, if you hover over stuff, it logs > 1 h4?
[19:39:20] <trakinas> morficus: I didnt know there were a "parents()" function.
[19:39:43] <morficus> yup - http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[19:39:45] <haizum_> i have a bunch of div's with images inside that i want to all fade in one after another, randomly
[19:39:48] <morficus> .parent() goes up one level
[19:39:52] <haizum_> i've tried several examples on stackoverflow
[19:39:54] <haizum_> nothing works
[19:40:00] <morficus> .parents() goes up all the way, until it finds a matching class
[19:40:09] <rmurphey> haizum_: please post a *reduced* demo to jsfiddle
[19:40:14] <rmurphey> that is, do not post all of your code
[19:40:25] <rmurphey> just the code that demonstrates what you've tried that is not working

[19:42:20] <LindsayMac> So i'm looking at this here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10922178/javascript-viewport-fade-in-fade-out
[19:42:53] <LindsayMac> does anyone have any ideas as to how I can animate a <div> based on which <article> Is in the viewport?
[19:47:13] <digipol> LindsayMac use $(".className"); instead of $(this); to target a specific element
[19:47:25] <digipol> i think thats what tyou were asking?
[19:47:54] <Foxhoundz> is it really a good idea to drop support for IE 9, 8, and 7 for jQ 2.0?
[19:47:55] <LindsayMac> digipol:  i am basically trying to target a div  based on which <article> is in view
[19:48:36] <rmurphey> Foxhoundz: clearly you think it is not?
[19:48:59] <Foxhoundz> I mean 6,7,8*
[19:49:00] <LindsayMac> digipol:  the issue with the code I am finding is that I need the same element to change class based on multiple different "cases"
[19:49:04] <Foxhoundz> I can understand 7 and below
[19:49:06] <Foxhoundz> but 8?
[19:49:19] <rmurphey> Foxhoundz: you can always use jquery 1.9
[19:49:48] <phonebook_> im for it, someone needs to kick ie in the pants
[19:49:54] <rmurphey> Foxhoundz: ie8 is 3 years old, and will be older still by the time 2.0 comes out
[19:49:56] <phonebook_> them sucking so bad is inexcusable
[19:50:03] <rmurphey> there is a clear path for backcompat
[19:50:10] <rmurphey> what is your objection?
[19:50:30] <digipol> you could try using css selectors to target the article? className:first-child
[19:50:57] <LindsayMac> digipol:  no.. basically this is the setup:
[19:51:07] <digipol> do you have a jsfiddle?
[19:51:14] <LindsayMac> digipol:  grabbing it now
[19:51:22] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/5et3t/2/ digipol
[19:51:38] <LindsayMac> i have a single page style website with a smooth scroll to scroll to each article id
[19:52:03] <LindsayMac> I need to take the "white-box" and expand and contract the height based on which article is in my viewpor t
[19:52:26] <LindsayMac> so basically i am animating based on what is in my viewport, but I'm animating the same element multiplate times with different case scenarios
[19:52:45] <LindsayMac> and the hardest thing (because waypoints ALMOST does exactly that ) is to get it to unanimate when it goes out of view
[19:52:54] <trakinas> rmurphey, morficus : thank you! I fixed it here. =]
[19:52:57] <LindsayMac> (un animate meaning removeClass)
[19:53:01] <rmurphey> trakinas: very good :)
[19:53:05] <morficus> woot!
[19:53:15] <tw2113> check offset from top for each article, and if it's between certain ints, adjust hight?
[19:53:18] <tw2113> height*
[19:53:29] <samholmes> I have a listener on the window that checks the event.target and does stuff according to which element was clicked. When I do $("#element").trigger('click
[19:53:34] <tw2113> i dunno
[19:53:40] <samholmes> '); the window doesn't fire
[19:53:44] <samholmes> the window event  I mean.
[19:54:00] <rmurphey> Foxhoundz: did you have more to say or did you just come in here to complain and then not explain your position?
[19:54:01] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  that doesnt work for multiple different articles and then trigger again on the out
[19:55:36] <digipol> it's pretty confusing what your trying to do here.
[19:55:57] <digipol> to want the articles to display in that pink box, and resize depending on the height of the article?
[19:56:14] <samholmes> Should the window event listener trigger if I invoke the click event on an element?
[19:58:02] <LindsayMac> digipol:  the articles wont actually display IN the pink box, but just on top of it
[19:58:24] <LindsayMac> digipol:  it would be nice to resize based ont he height of the article, but i'm ok with a defined height as well
[19:58:36] <rmurphey> samholmes: http://jsfiddle.net/6pmZv/

[20:00:01] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  i am playing with that now
[20:00:09] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  its the almost there solution
[20:01:39] <tw2113> $('p.inview').bind('inview', function (event, visible) { if (visible) { //Set div height } else { //I dunno    } });
[20:03:04] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  I know.. but thats only 1/4 of what im trying to do
[20:03:54] <tw2113> just rethrowing $.02
[20:04:04] <LindsayMac> know.. def. appreciated.
[20:04:14] <LindsayMac> just making sure the scope of what im doing is understood

[20:05:18] <samholmes> Why did I get the feeling that you were a chick?
[20:05:22] <tw2113> you see me all the time LindsayMac
[20:05:28] <samholmes> I should have followed that feeling.
[20:05:29] <LindsayMac> you said it ;)
[20:06:22] <tw2113> yayquery!
[20:06:42] * tw2113 still holds hope that it will eventually return
[20:06:49] <digipol> sorry i am looking at your code but it's a bit messy
[20:07:15] <Foxhoundz> rmurphey: Don't be so eager to criticize me. All I did was ask a question.
[20:07:22] <rmurphey> LindsayMac: i am about to head to bed, but wanted to at the very least applaud your nick :)
[20:07:38] <rmurphey> Foxhoundz: just curious because you came in, immediately criticized, and then said nothing
[20:07:45] <LindsayMac> whats so great about my nick?!
[20:07:49] <LindsayMac> haha rmurphey
[20:08:02] <tw2113> yeah, Mac isn't even your last name
[20:08:12] <tw2113> :D
[20:08:15] <rmurphey> i like LindsayMac quite a bit, and my partner goes through phases of listening to her nonstop
[20:08:24] <Foxhoundz> rmurphey: Yes, because I'm always obligated to provide all of my attention to IRC.
[20:08:25] <LindsayMac> hahaha
[20:08:28] <rmurphey> well, lindsay mac the singer

[20:12:37] <LindsayMac> ugh I cant get this to work
[20:12:43] <Foxhoundz> LindsayMac: what to work
[20:12:56] <LindsayMac> http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin/
[20:19:27] <LindsayMac> Foxhoundz:  im trying to change the class of a fixed div based on which element is in viewport.
[20:21:17] <jonkersjoe> hey this is a dumb question, I'm debugging my code. And I've noticed my function is not working because when I do $("input") its returning back HTMLInputElement instead of a jquery object. I tried this in console to get it, why is this returning the dom element and why wouldn't it wrap it in a jquery object ?
[20:23:01] <digipol> tbh LindsayMac based on that jsfiddle you gave me you seem to be over complicating what your trying to do.
[20:23:18] <LindsayMac> digipol:  how so>
[20:23:25] <LindsayMac> you may be over simplifying
[20:23:32] <digipol> showing and hiding and element and resizing it's parent container is what you want to do right?
[20:23:43] <digipol> an*
[20:23:52] <LindsayMac> no
[20:24:02] <LindsayMac> the container is NOT a parent container that needs resizing
[20:24:22] <LindsayMac> in fact, that container that needs resizing is in two completely separate containers..
[20:24:28] <digipol> why?
[20:25:00] <LindsayMac> digipol:  because it has to be fixed to the top of the screen as I scroll down past the <article> elements
[20:25:06] <LindsayMac> its kind of a part of the heading
[20:25:11] <LindsayMac> versus a part of the body
[20:25:22] <digipol> so you want to resize one element based on the size another unrelated container?
[20:25:22] <LindsayMac> and the reason for this is because it's stuck to the top
[20:25:27] <LindsayMac> nope
[20:25:41] <LindsayMac> i want to resize one element based on which element is currently in my viewport
[20:27:02] <LindsayMac> so if i scroll to <article id="6"> I want the #white-box to have the class tall
[20:27:16] <morficus> ID's can't  be numbers
[20:27:17] <morficus> nor classes
[20:27:20] <digipol> ok well sorry i don't really get what your trying to do, do i do suggest you clean up the syntax in that jsfiddle and make the objective clear if you want anyone to help.
[20:27:21] <morficus> they can't start with numbers
[20:27:25] <LindsayMac> if i scroll to <article id="2"> I want the #white-box to have the class short
[20:27:32] <digs> How can I know when I go from address to the next? http://dev.fdanconia.com/los/upload/webform
[20:27:32] <LindsayMac> morficus:  im just playing around with stuff right now
[20:27:49] <digs> or from one address to not in that address
[20:28:33] <LindsayMac> I left the smoothscroll js in there because I figured people would better understand that I was making a stack of conainers to scrollTo
[20:31:29] <jonkersjoe> anyone, its working againâ€¦ but puzzled why it bombed out
[20:31:52] <LindsayMac> digipol:  does this help?? cleaned a little http://jsfiddle.net/5et3t/10/
[20:32:12] <LindsayMac> thats about as "simplified " as I can get
[20:32:15] <digipol> then i can only suggest toggleClass("short tall"); in your click function
[20:32:32] <digipol> soo much better
[20:32:46] <LindsayMac> the #white-box needs to add class tall or removeClass tall when a previously specified article ID is in the viewport
[20:33:05] <LindsayMac> the code it in it now is using waypoints.js which I have realized isnt going to work for this
[20:33:14] <LindsayMac> so now I am looking at this: http://jsbin.com/ugupa/edit#javascript,html
[20:33:20] <LindsayMac> but I cant get it to work
[20:35:04] * tw2113 tries to seduce it for you
[20:35:19] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  if i cant seduce it.. ....
[20:35:21] <LindsayMac> ha
[20:35:33] <tw2113> well, it may find me hotter
[20:35:40] <digs> ahhhh $("div.address").focusout
[20:36:31] <LindsayMac> as soon as I try to adjust the parameters, it breaks
[20:37:11] <LindsayMac> how do I add #white-box into a variable that I could use inplce of this.
[20:37:22] <LindsayMac> or $(this)
[20:38:17] <digipol> var white-box= $("div#white-box");
[20:39:20] <LindsayMac> digipol:  thanks
[20:41:35] <LindsayMac> so how code when i add this: $(white_box).addClass(tall);
[20:41:44] <LindsayMac> i get the error "tall is not defined"
[20:41:52] <LindsayMac> Do i need to set the var for tall as well?
[20:42:32] <digipol> no you can just use toggle class but there are alot of problems with your naming conventions
[20:42:50] <digipol>  you can't be using numbers and dashes and crap in you class and id names
[20:42:57] <LindsayMac> ok i can change thosr
[20:42:59] <LindsayMac> those
[20:43:11] <digipol> otherwise you have to escape them in the javascript, and i gotta go back to work man,
[20:44:33] <LindsayMac> im gonna fix it
[20:47:05] <LindsayMac> Ok so why did changing my class names break my smoothscroll!!????
[20:47:30] <LindsayMac> I get this error because I changed my article id="6" to article id="sixth"
[20:47:33] <LindsayMac> 	
[20:47:33] <LindsayMac> var targetOffset = $target.offset().top;
[20:47:43] <LindsayMac> $target.offset() is null

[21:13:52] <Cork> atno: http response status
[21:14:00] <Cork> no json
[21:14:40] <Cork> if you want to send additional information, you can send that as any format you like
[21:15:23] <atno> Cork care to show an example ?
[21:15:32] <Cork> an example for what?
[21:15:54] <atno> of what you've described above
[21:16:08] <Cork> uh, that depends on what server language your using
[21:16:21] <Cork> your setting the http status of the response
[21:17:58] <atno> oh, thank you Cork
[21:18:07] <Cork> and just to make clear, ya jquery doesn't have a proper format, it uses the same callbacks that you get natively
[21:22:55] <skreech__> hi, i need a little help with jqtouch
[21:23:01] <skreech__> anybody free?

[21:27:19] <skreech__> I have having this anomoly with swipe (jqtouch). I am trying to redirect using swipe, and it works for one direction, but not the other. check nathani.me/JQtouch
[21:30:35] <Cork> skreech__: your page is broken, it only works in webkit
[21:34:24] <tomoyuki28jp> How can we get all the form values without selializing it? I wanna get it as a hash, not a string.
[21:34:40] <Cork> ?.serializeArray
[21:34:40] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[21:35:02] <tomoyuki28jp> Cork: thanks a lot!
[21:35:06] <Cork> you can't represent a form as an object (hash)
[21:35:17] <Cork> cause you can have the same name multiple times
[21:40:15] <haizum_> is it possible to set a speed for a :hover effect
[21:40:21] <haizum_> or is it just a standard speed
[21:40:29] <haizum_> specifically for opacity changes
[21:40:37] <haizum_> seems kind of slow
[21:46:00] <Cork> haizum_: :hover doesn't have a speed at all, its instant
[21:46:27] <Cork> unless you specify animations in your css
[21:47:41] <haizum_> cork: well seems slow here
[21:47:51] <Cork> you have a link?
[21:48:17] <haizum_> like it fades, rather than instantly changes opacity
[21:49:17] <Cork> you have a link? <--
[21:54:20] <skreech__> I have having this anomoly with swipe (jqtouch). I am trying to redirect using swipe, and it works for one direction, but not the other. check nathani.me/JQtouch
[21:54:39] <skreech__> i've uploaded the code there
[21:55:22] <Cork> skreech__: your page is broken, and needs to be unprefixed so it works on all modern browsers, theres no excuse for doing what your doing there

[21:57:23] <Cork> thats what i'm talking aboyt
[21:57:24] <Cork> *about
[21:57:48] <skreech__> oh, is that what is causing the problem. im using it for iphone only
[21:58:39] <Cork> skreech__: donno if thats what causes it, but its wrong
[21:59:01] <Cork> ppl thats doing that is actively breaking the web
[21:59:42] <skreech__> ok, i'll fix it: but the swipe issue (iphone) on page 3 is the bigger problem
[21:59:50] <skreech__> do you know whats causing it?
[22:02:28] <Cork> ugg my test iphone is out of power
[22:02:37] <Cork> and my normal phone doesn't animate your page
[22:02:44] <Cork> so donno
[22:03:00] <skreech__> what phone are you using? its using jqtouch. so it should work on android too
[22:03:49] <bcardarella> Is there an easy selector in jquery to make both statements in this fiddle true? http://jsfiddle.net/Pu6H6/
[22:04:45] <bcardarella> when submitting a form the form will choose the last element of the same name to select the value. However, in the case of checkbox it ignores checkboxes if left unchecked so the form will prefer the hidden input of the same name
[22:05:28] <Cork> skreech__: opps, forgot that i didn't use the default browser
[22:05:37] <Cork> skreech__: step 3 animates for me
[22:05:44] <skreech__> both left and right?
[22:05:50] <skreech__> and it redirects you?
[22:06:01] <Cork> 1,2,3 and then 2, 1 again yes
[22:07:05] <skreech__> so, if you swipe left- you go to page 2, and if you swipe right, page 1?
[22:07:57] <skreech__> bcardarella: you mistyped: var q2 = parseInt($('[name="question_1"]').val(), 10);
[22:08:01] <skreech__> it should be var q2 = parseInt($('[name="question_2"]').val(), 10);
[22:08:31] <bcardarella> skreech__: yes, http://jsfiddle.net/Pu6H6/1/ same problem though
[22:08:52] <Cork> bcardarella: http://jsfiddle.net/Pu6H6/2/
[22:08:55] <skreech__> basically, you want the checkbox to show the correct number?
[22:09:26] <Cork> skreech__: no if i click the link it animates to the left
[22:09:33] <Cork> and if i click back in animates back again
[22:09:39] <Cork> swiping does nothing
[22:09:48] <Cork> on any of the pages
[22:10:05] <skreech__> oh- yikes, on iphone, it works on one side but not the other
[22:10:15] <skreech__> i'm tyring to get the swiping working
[22:10:36] <Cork> well your page is basically iphone only
[22:10:50] <bcardarella> skreech__: no, this is for targeting the correct input element as would happen during form submission
[22:10:56] <bcardarella> as I have detailed above
[22:11:11] <Cork> bcardarella: i gave you a fixed link
[22:11:27] <bcardarella> Cork: that only works if the inputs are always checkboxes or not
[22:11:48] <Cork> and you don't want to check if they've been checked?
[22:11:59] <Cork> only the static value you've added to them?
[22:11:59] <bcardarella> let me add a third test case
[22:12:11] <Cork> cause val won't ever change
[22:12:42] <bcardarella> Cork: val always grabs the first element, my point is that the selector being used is matching both elements for both test cases
[22:12:55] <Cork> fo use .last
[22:13:08] <bcardarella> I don't think I'm explaining the use case properly
[22:13:11] <Cork> though again, remember it won't reflect user input on the checkbox
[22:13:19] <bcardarella> when submitting a form the form will choose the last element of the same name to select the value. However, in the case of checkbox it ignores checkboxes if left unchecked so the form will prefer the hidden input of the same name
[22:13:34] <bcardarella> I want to simulate this
[22:13:50] <Cork> bcardarella: why don't you just use serialize?
[22:13:54] <Cork> or serializeArray
[22:14:20] <Cork> it has the case handling for looking for checked checkboxes
[22:14:33] <bcardarella> looking up those docs...
[22:14:40] <Cork> and yes you need to special case that
[22:15:40] <Cork> and the reason you get the first btw is cause jquery .val and similar one element actions always work on the first element in the array
[22:15:57] <Cork> while form generation has a last win (they overwrite the previus ones)
[22:16:17] <bcardarella> I understand that, my issue isn't with val(), its with the query I'm using
[22:16:39] <Cork> well your selecting two elements and uses .val on them
[22:16:48] <Cork> so you get the value from the first element in the dom
[22:16:55] <Cork> that matches the selector
[22:17:01] <bcardarella> my question was on changing the query
[22:17:06] <Cork> you can't
[22:17:14] <Cork> you need to loop the matched elements
[22:17:27] <Cork> or use .last
[22:17:29] <Cork> ?.last
[22:17:29] <bot-t> .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[22:17:45] <Cork> but that won't match the hidden value
[22:17:46] <bcardarella> .last will cause the first test case to fail
[22:18:01] <Cork> ya, cause it knows nothing about fallback
[22:18:49] <Cork> you need to select both elements set the hidden value to a var, and check if the checkbox is set, if so overwrite the value from the hidden value
[22:18:57] <Cork> else ignore the second element
[22:20:00] <Cork> or like i said, use serialize or serializeArray, they filtering for you see ?.serializeArray
[22:20:00] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[22:20:29] <Cork> *they do the filtering
[22:20:55] <digipol> could any kind soul give me a hint on selecting elements in jquery http://jsfiddle.net/bEXTL/
[22:21:30] <digipol> here if you click the like button i'd like the appended text to apply only to the one of the panels not all of them
[22:24:19] <defaultro> hey folks, my officemate told me to study DOM. What are some good resources about DOM? Is MDN DOM?
[22:24:39] <tw2113> MDN is a resource of information, including stuff regarding the DOM
[22:24:47] <defaultro> k
[22:26:08] <Gambit-> why does $.ajax() send data as form data?
[22:26:52] <Cork> Gambit-: form data?
[22:27:00] <Cork> you mean query or params?
[22:27:20] <Gambit-> I mean defaulting the contentType to 'application/x-www-form-urlendoded' for a POST.
[22:27:39] <Cork> cause thats what almost every server on the planet expects

[22:28:00] <Gambit-> ah, all of the django stuff I'm using expects json.
[22:28:26] <Cork> application/json requests??
[22:28:51] <Gambit-> ... yessssss..?  POST and PUT and DELETE etc.
[22:29:03] <Cork> thats rare
[22:29:16] <Cork> normally they use a variable with json in them
[22:29:22] <digipol> cool i'll have a look and get my head around that one, it's similar to what i was trying but couldn't get the syntax right cheers man.
[22:29:28] <Cork> like data=<json>
[22:30:10] <Cork> digipol: also check delegated event listeners, that way you don't have to bind one listener for every button
[22:30:14] <Cork> ?.on @ digipol
[22:30:15] <bot-t> digipol, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:30:17] <Gambit-> use a variable with json in them?
[22:30:23] <Cork> yes
[22:30:35] <Gambit-> I'm using tastypie, btw.
[22:30:58] <digipol> cool thanks so much for the info guys
[22:31:42] <Cork> ?eval var j = { t:'v1', a:52 }; "data=" + encodeURI(JSON.strifify(j))
[22:31:45] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: JSON.strifify is not a function
[22:31:52] <Cork> WTF...
[22:31:58] <Cork> WTF...oh
[22:32:05] <Cork> ?eval var j = { t:'v1', a:52 }; "data=" + encodeURI(JSON.stringify(j))
[22:32:05] <bot-t> Cork: "data=%7B%22t%22:%22v1%22,%22a%22:52%7D"
[22:32:12] <Cork> Gambit-: ^
[22:32:21] <Cork> something like that
[22:32:28] <Gambit-> ah
[22:32:54] <Gambit-> afaik, no, but I'm still pretty new to all this. I just know what I send down the wire in postman to cause things to occur.
[22:33:01] <tomoyuki28jp> How can I dump Hashie::Mash?
[22:33:17] <bcardarella> Solved it: http://jsfiddle.net/Pu6H6/19/
[22:33:19] <Cork> tomoyuki28jp: most likely wrong channel
[22:33:28] <tomoyuki28jp> ah, yes, sorry!
[22:34:24] <Cork> bcardarella: just be aware that that selector is really slow
[22:34:49] <bcardarella> Cork: is that because of the 'not' ?
[22:35:02] <Cork> its cause your using :<selectors> yes
[22:35:13] <Cork> each one of them is a loop over the selected elements
[22:35:35] <bcardarella> Cork: right, but I would otherwise be doing the loops myself
[22:35:39] <Cork> and i would hate to be the one stumbling on that line, its not really readable
[22:35:49] <bcardarella> and the set is never going to be very large
[22:36:03] <Cork> bcardarella: just a question before i rewrite it, why are you so against using serialize?
[22:36:11] <bcardarella> in most cases it will be one element, in some cases 2. In very very rare cases will it be more than 2
[22:36:36] <bcardarella> Cork: how would you write with serialize?
[22:36:58] <Cork> $('input').serializeArray();
[22:37:02] <Cork> for example
[22:37:20] <Cork> that'll give you an array with the matched [name, value] lines
[22:37:45] <danheberden> just gonna set this here: https://github.com/danheberden/serializeObject
[22:38:01] <bcardarella> Cork: ah, I see now
[22:38:10] <bcardarella> yeah, you're right that is better
[22:38:13] <Cork> that handles removing the duplicate hidden value ya
[22:38:18] <bcardarella> then I just select the last element from the array
[22:38:38] <Cork> bcardarella: or use the serailzieObject, it handles it all for you
[22:38:51] <Cork> bcardarella: the point was to no have to do multiple selectors
[22:40:03] <Cork> bcardarella: var values = $('input'); values.question_1; values.question_2
[22:40:08] <Cork> opps
[22:40:17] <Cork> bcardarella: var values = $('input').serializeObject(); values.question_1; values.question_2
[22:41:15] <Cork> uh... i would prob not use that plugin on second look
[22:41:20] <Cork> its over complicated
[22:41:37] <bcardarella> I'm not going to use it, I don't want any external dependencies
[22:41:42] <bcardarella> other than jquery
[22:43:01] <Cork> so use var values = {}; $.each($('input').serializeArray(), function(i, val) { values[val[0]] = val[1]; });
[22:52:03] <bokgroll> if I want to bind an event handler to multiple elements by class, do I have to $.each with a class selector or will $('.myClass').on() work on all of them by default?
[22:53:37] <coldhead> neither :)
[22:53:41] <coldhead> ?on
[22:53:41] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:53:56] <bokgroll> hm
[22:54:21] <coldhead> you want something like $('somecontainer').on('click', '.your, .classes, .here', function () {...
[22:54:29] <coldhead> check the docs
[22:55:04] <bokgroll> alright, thanks
[22:56:03] <coldhead> good luck!
[23:08:41] <jonkersjoe> hi just noticed, that jquery is erroring if I call each method on a null selection. http://jsfiddle.net/aWPrg/  is this normal ? first time I've seen this happening
[23:13:43] <Cork> man jsfiddle is slow today :/ (again)
[23:13:55] <jonkersjoe> yeah it is
[23:14:21] <jonkersjoe> Cork: have you seen .each method fail if there is null elements ?
[23:14:35] <Cork> jonkersjoe: i need to see what exactly you mean with a null selector
[23:14:52] <Cork> you think you could paste it on one of the other sites?
[23:14:57] <Cork> ?p
[23:14:57] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:15:11] <Cork> jsfiddle is just dead
[23:15:12] <jonkersjoe> yeah sure
[23:20:51] <jonkersjoe> hey cork: first time using jsbin so not sure how to use the site : http://jsbin.com/izocud/3/edit
[23:23:20] <tw2113> it's a lot like jsfiddle but with bigger windows and a bit more clicking
[23:23:36] <tw2113> and it's own error console
[23:24:15] <jonkersjoe> yeah just saw it giving me 50 warnings for a small piece of js
[23:24:23] <Cork> hmm it finds illegal character somewhere...
[23:24:35] <Cork> http://jsbin.com/izocud/4/edit#javascript,html
[23:25:39] <digipol> oh i had that problem this morning is was real weird, copy paste into a plain text editor
[23:26:04] <Cork> jonkersjoe: you have some none printable characters in there http://jsbin.com/izocud/7/edit
[23:26:20] <Cork> if you remove them it works fine
[23:27:45] <tw2113> any of you use Stripe payments?
[23:28:03] <jonkersjoe> ohâ€¦ I just re-wrote and it is working fine.. I'm getting strange things happening to me today. I'm getting html elements returned instead of a jquery object...
[23:29:59] <digipol> yeah it's a weird one had me scratching my head this morning for a while too.
[23:32:05] <jonkersjoe> yeah this is chrome as well, I just closed the tab re-opened it and it is working fineâ€¦ (mycode not jsbin or jsfiddle). Lost a lot of time debugging things which ended up working after opening a new tab etc..
[23:33:56] <jonkersjoe> nope i lied, its still happening. $("input:checked").each(function(){console.log(this);}); is giving me Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[23:40:01] <Cork> jonkersjoe: if you type $.fn.jquery in your console what do you get?
[23:44:20] <ert> jonkersjoe: in http://fiddle.jshell.net/aWPrg/show/ it works
[23:44:24] <jonkersjoe> 1.7.2
[23:45:01] <Cork> jonkersjoe: sounds like your loading something on the page that extends jquery wrongly
[23:45:10] <ert> in http://jsfiddle.net/aWPrg/ it won't
[23:45:21] <Cork> the lenth undefined warning is from jquerys internal array
[23:48:16] <jonkersjoe> yeah, firebug is giving me object undefined on the line length=object.length on line 632.

[23:56:09] <Nobita> Hi, I'm trying to create a vertical slider like https://www.do.com/ , can I get some idea regarding how they have done it possible? Thanks.
[23:57:12] <digipol> it looks like they are using webkit transform for the transitions
[23:57:18] <digipol> it's a nice site
[23:57:35] <ert> Benqb: do you see any errors in the console?
[23:58:06] <digipol> that was @ Nobita
[23:59:48] <Benqb> no
