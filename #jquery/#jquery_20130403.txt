[00:28:18] <lejocelyn> When I serialize post data with jquery, how to I recover them with php ?
[00:28:51] <lejocelyn> :D
[00:28:58] <lejocelyn> ok, I just found unserialize
[00:29:01] <lejocelyn> nevermind
[00:30:42] <j_wright> that's the same format?
[00:32:10] <lejocelyn> j_wright: what do you mean?
[00:32:35] <lejocelyn> it doesn't work yet actually :-(
[00:33:07] <lejocelyn> I've got some form inputs that I want to ajax send to a php script
[00:33:17] <lejocelyn> so I serialize them into data
[00:33:34] <lejocelyn> then with the php script, I unserialize them
[00:33:41] <lejocelyn> but, as for now, it doesn't work
[00:33:43] <echoee> not possible to send htem as is?
[00:33:50] <echoee> why serializing?
[00:34:01] <lejocelyn> because I use Ajax
[00:34:08] <lejocelyn> I though I had to serialize thel
[00:34:14] <lejocelyn> if not, I would be happy not to
[00:34:18] <lejocelyn> but I can't see how to
[00:34:49] <echoee> yeah, you're right
[00:35:00] <lejocelyn> well, it still doesn't work
[00:35:01] <echoee> so you got the data on the server?
[00:35:14] <lejocelyn> yes

[00:38:15] <lejocelyn> I didn't know
[00:38:23] <echoee> all good
[00:38:25] <lejocelyn> I don't get the use of unserialize then
[00:38:52] <j_wright> see serialize
[00:38:53] <echoee> it's for the PHP serialize
[00:39:00] <j_wright> the php one
[00:39:07] <lejocelyn> had
[00:39:08] <lejocelyn> ha
[00:39:09] <lejocelyn> ok
[00:39:29] <lejocelyn> too bad javascript and php didn't agree on the same format of serialization

[00:51:27] <mkoks> hey, just want to know - would that be hard to edit (thats not the right word but cannot think of better right now) jquery ui date widget? For example I need to change its interface so I could select many dates and many other things.
[00:51:39] <mkoks> more talking about the widget complexity itself
[00:52:23] <Cork> mkoks: there should always be extensions that extends datepicker
[00:52:55] <mkoks> but I want to make mine?
[00:53:02] <mkoks> *if I
[00:53:16] <Cork> http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/datePicker/v2/demo/datePickerMultiple.html
[00:53:39] <Cork> mkoks: you extend the widget with the features you want to add
[00:54:08] <stressedgringo> Cork: you're too late, i got it now...
[00:55:32] <Corrado> I'm trying listeners with onKernelRequest, if imposed a new redirect (for example, $event->setResponse(new RedirectResponse($url));  on the page we redirect, but does not load the css
[00:56:05] <Cork> Corrado: are you sure that was meant for this channel?
[00:56:22] <Corrado> oh sorry !! i mistake channel ! sorry again !
[00:57:40] <mkoks> thanks Cork
[00:58:14] <mkoks> seems like multiple selection function is built in, right?
[00:59:21] <Cork> don't think so
[00:59:27] <Cork> but i haven't used it in ages
[01:03:19] <pm28> hi ujjain u are from Ujjain M.p. ?
[01:06:59] <ph88> I'm trying to build a testcase in jsfiddle, but i have problem loading external library,  i tried "External Resources" and after i tried this:   http://jsfiddle.net/GrXww/
[01:07:46] <Cork> ph8: you can't load javascript from pastebin
[01:07:53] <Cork> it has the wrong content type
[01:08:05] <Cork> (same for css)
[01:08:33] <ph88> ooh, do you know a good place to put the files online ?
[01:08:53] <Cork> why don't you just put them in the script section?
[01:09:14] <ph88> i could ... very big files though
[01:09:20] <ph88> css: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=pdsuKUEu
[01:09:26] <ph88> js: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=beVvLvrW
[01:09:51] <ph88> people don't wanna look at my test case if i put so much i'm afraid :(
[01:10:20] <Cork> ppl will have to look at it anyway
[01:11:15] <ph88> ah yes it works now at least :)
[01:14:24] <NoWired> anyone knows if exists a js/jquery library, to generate a graphic (timeline) like this: http://greer.nodolinux.com/pic/linux/DiagramaLinux.jpg ?
[01:18:46] <ph88> Cork:  thx with your help i was able to make my test case :)
[01:19:10] <ph88> Does somebody know how i can restore the select2 functionality after switching tabs, test case will make clear what the problem is:  http://jsfiddle.net/jN25k/1/
[01:20:44] <ph88> my own JS/CSS code is on the bottom after loading select2 stuff
[01:21:30] <ph88> This is the tab functionality without select2 http://jsfiddle.net/GrXww/1/   <-- works perfect
[01:25:02] <ph88> oh that last link is not right,. should be this:  http://jsfiddle.net/jN25k/
[01:25:21] <ph88> So tabs: http://jsfiddle.net/jN25k/    Select2:   http://jsfiddle.net/GrXww/1/     Together (not working):   http://jsfiddle.net/jN25k/1/
[01:34:16] <Altreus> I have some old jQuery (I think) that does $(document).bind('keydown', 'ctrl+return', func)  ...  But I can't find any indication that this was ever possible. Is it actually jquery?
[01:34:41] <Cork> ph8: what is it that isn't working in the last pb?
[01:34:51] <seutje> `g simile timeline @ NoWired
[01:34:52] <b-ot> NoWired: Ubuntu 11.10: Linux a prova di tardivo digitale [foto] - Wired.it ‚Üí http://gadget.wired.it/news/mondo_computer/2011/10/24/ubuntu-11-10-sistema-operativo-15117.html
[01:34:54] <seutje> WAT?
[01:34:59] <Cork> Altreus: tahts done through an extension
[01:35:14] <seutje> NoWired: I meant http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/
[01:35:19] <Altreus> Cork: ah!
[01:35:24] <Altreus> I'll check the old header
[01:35:32] <Cork> Altreus: but as far as i know, it never worked very well
[01:35:54] <Cork> Altreus: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/hotkeys
[01:36:00] <ph88> Cork:  if you try the last one, if you select Tab2 then again Tab1 the select2 functionality no longer works
[01:36:14] <Altreus> Cork: That plugin is definitely in the old HTML so that'll be it. Thanks!
[01:36:29] <Altreus> I would've been here all day if you hadn't known that
[01:37:16] <Cork> ph88: ah, you serialize the html and replace it in the dom
[01:37:33] <Cork> that means you remove all the old dom elements, the event bindings, states everything
[01:37:54] <ph88> Cork: maybe i'm doing it the wrong way ?  i just made this tab functionality as i guessed is the right way ...
[01:37:56] <Cork> ph88: i would recommend doing the tab shifting through hiding wrapper elements instead
[01:38:23] <Cork> $('#tab1-content').hide(); $('#tab2-content').show()
[01:38:24] <ph88> Cork: you mean hide and show different boxes instead of copy and empty ?
[01:38:32] <ph88> OK :D
[01:38:38] <ph88> great idea !
[01:38:45] <Cork> that way you keep all the states
[01:38:50] <ph88> thxxxxxxxxx
[01:38:57] <Cork> ph88: alternatively move the dom elements out of the dom
[01:39:04] <ph88> how would i do that ?
[01:39:08] <Cork> and keep them as a dom tree instead of serialize them
[01:39:27] <ph88> i have no experience with this
[01:39:37] <ph88> like i wasn't even aware that i was serializing them
[01:39:52] <Cork> well you already have them in dom, so you could have a container
[01:39:59] <Cork> and just append the id to them
[01:40:08] <Cork> when you append a dom element to one place it moves
[01:40:18] <Cork> so, just remove the .html() section
[01:40:24] <Cork> and when you want it out move it back
[01:40:46] <ph88> can you show a line of code ?
[01:41:44] <NoWired> seutje, thanks, but the timeline that I need, is to make the same that I show in the image
[01:41:57] <Cork> hmm you alredy have them all in the form so display: none is prob the simplest solution
[01:42:00] <NoWired> I need this: http://greer.nodolinux.com/pic/linux/DiagramaLinux.jpg
[01:42:15] <seutje> NoWired: u can just use github's then
[01:42:17] <NoWired> because, I need to relationate new things to older
[01:42:38] <thomedy> how come i have a iframe.load()
[01:42:41] <thomedy> sorry
[01:43:05] <seutje> that's ok, iframes happen to the best of us
[01:43:13] <ph88> ok thx again Cork
[01:43:47] <NoWired> I found a lot off similar jquery plugins as you showed me, but I don't found any who is valid for me, thanks anyway, and sorry for my bad english, hahahaha
[01:44:21] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/jN25k/2/
[01:44:39] <ph88> verrryy nice :D
[01:45:14] <Cork> ph88: and you prob want the checked="checked" on the default tab too
[01:45:15] <ph88> i think .hide() just applies display: none;  so it's the same as addclass ...
[01:45:44] <Cork> ph88: depends if you want to do more then just changing the inline style attribute
[01:46:06] <Cork> ph88: addClass adds the class in the css file, but ya, .show/.hide can do the same thing
[01:46:32] <Cork> though i would actually argue that its better to use a class (if you want to use some of the new css features its much simpler)
[01:47:07] <ph88> ok i will keep that in mind :)
[01:47:18] <Cork> ph88: btw, you prob want a label around the tab text (with a for="tab1" so the text is clickable too
[01:47:49] <ph88> Cork:  yes thx i have checked="checked" and i have labels in my real application ..  this was just the test case to break down the problem
[01:47:59] * Cork nods
[01:48:19] * ph88 smiles
[01:50:43] <davesleep> 'lo, how do i grab a hidden value from html using jquery
[01:50:54] <davesleep> or also, how do i grab the div id of the div a level above?
[01:52:07] <Cork> hiddeen value?
[01:52:19] <Cork> you mean an input of type hidden?
[01:53:30] <davesleep> yeah, without a form, the thing is, i am modifying and inplace edit, but i need to send the ID
[01:53:44] <davesleep> and* an
[01:54:25] <ph88> $("#hidden_input").val();
[01:54:37] <davesleep> oh man, i just realised as soon as you typed that
[01:54:41] * davesleep facepalms
[01:54:48] <ph88> :|
[01:55:01] <davesleep> wait, the thing is, i have hundreds of little places to edit
[01:55:16] <davesleep> it shouldn't matter should it because it will only take the one i've clicked on
[01:55:21] <davesleep> well, i'll try it, brb
[02:07:43] <raj> will window.open(filepath) necessarily open a new window for a file download?
[02:08:26] <raj> i'm looking to just have a file download
[02:10:33] <Cork> raj: new window or new tab
[02:10:53] <raj> oh, how does it determine which?
[02:10:56] <Cork> and yes, the alternative is to use window.location = filepath
[02:11:08] <Cork> raj: user action, and the browser preferences
[02:11:18] <raj> ok
[02:11:33] <raj> Cork, what if I just want the file to download wihout opening anyhing?
[02:11:41] <Cork> window.location = filepath
[02:12:05] <Cork> but if the browser thinks it can render it it will replace your current page
[02:13:27] <raj> unless i change the content disposition?
[02:13:40] <raj> to attachment
[02:13:57] <Cork> and that is one of the way to tell the browser it can't render it ya :)
[02:14:10] <raj> cool
[02:14:14] <raj> are there others?
[02:14:28] <Cork> content-type
[02:14:47] <raj> or can I specify that pictures can be rendered, but text files can't
[02:15:01] <Cork> if the browser doens't know the content type it will offer to open it externally/download it
[02:15:22] <Cork> raj: for text and images disposition is what you need to use
[02:16:02] <raj> i noticed that window.open doesn't work with content disposition, it still opens a new tab/window
[02:16:09] <raj> why's that?
[02:16:21] <Cork> it opens a new tab and that new tab triggers the download window
[02:16:35] <Cork> window.open ALWAYS opens a new tab or new window
[02:16:40] <raj> oh
[02:16:47] <raj> which would be annoying for a download
[02:16:51] <Cork> thats why i pointed at window.location
[02:17:21] <raj> k, I was considering allowing images to be viewed in the browser, everything else to be downloaded
[02:18:22] <raj> i can make all images not have an `attachment` content disposition, but then since i'm using window.location, it'll open in the current tab, which is not okay
[02:18:55] <Cork> raj: so add a class to the link, and pick window.open for one class and window.location for the other
[02:19:06] <Cork> (or use inline image showing for img's)
[02:19:27] <raj> hmm...ok, that makes sense
[02:19:37] <raj> thank you senor cork :)
[02:19:58] <Cork> lol
[02:21:45] <k_sze[work]> Does jQuery have an official function to parse the query string yet?
[02:22:26] <sacho> "the query string"?
[02:23:17] <k_sze[work]> URL query string parameters
[02:23:21] <Cork> no
[02:23:40] <Cork> cause most users don't need it
[02:23:46] <daanavitch> $('#page-ind').on('click', 'a', function(e) {
[02:23:46] <daanavitch> 	console.log($(this).index();
[02:23:46] <daanavitch> });
[02:23:49] <daanavitch> how can I find the index of a clicked element if I added the click handler like this:
[02:24:03] <Cork> index compared to what?
[02:24:05] <daanavitch> whoops, the code was supposed to be under my msg
[02:24:15] <daanavitch> I want the index of the child element that was clicked
[02:24:30] <daanavitch> but it always returns the index in #page-ind
[02:24:33] <Cork> $('#page-ind a').index(this)
[02:25:32] <daanavitch> Cork: works great, thanks!
[02:25:52] <Cork> daanavitch: that is the index of the match list though
[02:26:04] <daanavitch> Cork: what do you mean?
[02:26:12] <Cork> but it sounded like thats what you wanted
[02:26:25] <Cork> daanavitch: $(this).index() gives the child index in the dom
[02:26:36] <daanavitch> yes that's what I was looking for
[02:26:49] <Cork> while  $('#page-ind a').index(this) gives the index of where in the selection list it was
[02:27:08] <Cork> if so then $(this).index() should work
[02:27:43] <raj> Cork, if I need multiple files downloaded, so serverside I zip them, how can I then allow that zip files to be downloaded?
[02:28:23] <Cork> raj: hmm multiple
[02:28:44] <Cork> well you would prob have to use window.open or a set of iframes
[02:29:57] <raj> Cork, window.open would just open each file in the browser, no?
[02:30:10] <Cork> zip can't be viewed in the browser
[02:30:17] <Cork> so it would trigger a download for each tab
[02:30:27] <raj> each tab?
[02:30:40] <raj> oh, it would open a blank tab to download
[02:30:41] <Cork> or each window if you don't get a tab
[02:31:01] <raj> gotcha, don't really like that
[02:31:03] <Cork> no it would open a tab and show a blank page cause the source triggers a download window
[02:31:06] <raj> what about iframes?
[02:31:28] <Cork> you might be able to trigger the download window from a set of iframes in the page
[02:31:46] <raj> k, so how can I do that?
[02:31:47] <Cork> i haven't fully tested that though, so no grantee how well supported it is
[02:32:50] <Cork> var downloader = $('<iframe/>'); downloader.on('load', function() { downloader.remove(); }); downloader.prop('src', 'file');
[02:33:02] <Cork> opps
[02:33:05] <Cork> forgot one part
[02:33:31] <Cork> var downloader = $('<iframe/>'); downloader.on('load', function() { downloader.remove(); }); downloader.hide(); downloader.prop('src', 'file'); $(document.body).append(downloader);
[02:33:52] <Cork> raj: but this is really untested, so you will have to do some compatibility testing
[02:35:57] <raj> Cork, this guy says to create a script to zip the files, which I don't mind, but then how do I trigger the download of that single zip file? http://stackoverflow.com/a/2339452/997624
[02:38:37] <Cork> raj: uh, by pointing the browser at the zip file?
[02:38:47] <Cork> i don't really follow where the problem is
[02:39:28] <raj> the user checks/selects multiple files to download and then clicks the Download button
[02:39:52] <raj> i send an ajax request to the server with the file list to be zipped and zip those files, and respond with...
[02:39:55] <raj> ?
[02:40:25] <seutje> the url to the zip?
[02:40:33] <raj> cuz the zip file is being created on the fly
[02:40:46] <seutje> so? reply when the zip is done?
[02:41:00] <seutje> otherwise u'd have to re-poll anyway, no?
[02:41:03] <raj> seutje, so ajax response can do window.location = data['zip_url'] ?
[02:41:19] <Cork> raj: you should post that as a form in an iframe and the server should respond with the zip file
[02:41:36] <seutje> yeah or that
[02:41:37] <raj> post what as a form?
[02:41:44] <seutje> the files u want
[02:41:51] <Cork> what your now doing as ajax
[02:41:58] <raj> oh
[02:42:06] <raj> why's iframe preferred?
[02:42:07] <Cork> ajax can't trigger a download; a normal form post can
[02:42:12] <raj> ok
[02:42:29] <raj> so your code stands?
[02:42:42] <Cork> ah, no
[02:42:55] <Cork> you would have to create a form and form.submit() it
[02:42:57] <raj> does this code? http://stackoverflow.com/a/9425731/997624
[02:45:39] <Cork> raj: yes that looks like one way to do that
[02:46:00] <raj> what's with the timeout?
[02:46:29] <Cork> uh...
[02:46:36] <Cork> yuck
[02:46:53] <Cork> raj: they use a timer instead of a  onload to catch when it has loaded :s
[02:46:58] <raj> also mixing of basic js iteration and jquery
[02:47:20] <Cork> that actually have a point
[02:47:33] <Cork> cause attributes isn't an array
[02:47:46] <Cork> so i don't think it works with $.each
[02:47:59] <Cork> (not sure though)
[02:48:02] <raj> arguments?
[02:48:18] <Cork> unnamed attributes to a function
[02:48:25] <raj> oh
[02:48:35] <Cork> .js "hello"
[02:48:41] <Cork> hmm what was the trigger
[02:48:44] <Cork> >> "works"
[02:49:19] <Cork> ?eval var a = function() { print(arguments); }; a(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8);
[02:49:26] <bot-t> Cork: {}
[02:49:44] <Cork> O_o
[02:49:53] <horrror> does anybody know a good plugin to preview images before uploading? (using rails)
[02:49:58] <Cork> bot-t: you're broken
[02:49:58] <bot-t> Cork, Is that a question?
[02:50:08] <raj> haha
[02:50:08] <Cork> bot-t: no
[02:50:10] <bot-t> http://smplstk.ca/_/no.gif
[02:50:31] <Cork> :)
[02:50:54] <raj> Cork, the function does have two string arguments in that example though
[02:51:15] <raj> oh, you're saying $.each won't be able to work with those arguments
[02:51:21] <raj> to a function
[02:51:37] <raj> wait, why not?
[02:51:47] <Cork> arguments is an array like native thingy, but its a really weird one
[02:51:47] <raj> if it's within the function definition
[02:51:59] <raj> oh
[02:52:05] <Cork> $.each MIGHT be able to handle it
[02:52:08] <Cork> but i'm not sure
[02:52:10] <raj> k
[02:52:17] <raj> my parents are flipping out i'm awake
[02:52:23] <raj> i'll have to continue this tomorrow
[02:52:28] <raj> thank you very much Cork
[02:52:29] <Cork> lol
[02:52:31] <Cork> gnight
[02:52:39] <raj> as usual, you're a treasure trove of knowledge!
[03:32:35] <davesleep> yo, going bac to my original question
[03:32:49] <davesleep> the problem is, i have to create a hidden input for each div
[03:33:08] <davesleep> how do i target the hidden input that i've clicked on and take it's value
[03:33:42] <davesleep> it seems to just take the initial value
[03:34:00] <sacho> ? code sample
[03:34:04] <bot-t> sacho, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - jQuery Wiki - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Accordion
[03:34:11] <sacho> pfft bot-t
[03:35:39] <davesleep> the problem is a bit more complicated than that(i think)
[03:36:01] <davesleep> ... or is it
[03:36:02] <davesleep> one moment
[03:36:51] <davesleep> see the problem is, i have to put it outside the div that im editing
[03:37:04] <davesleep> if i put it inside, and target it direct (im already taking the click on a specific div)
[03:37:12] <davesleep> it loads it up in the edit box
[03:37:38] <davesleep> i think i can do a hacky thing see hwo that goes
[03:38:42] <Bogdaniel> hello i have a problem with a slideshow, after the first image it stops loading the others anyone who can help me out a bit ? :D http://prod.biroexpert.ro/
[03:53:07] <ph88> how do i get the current state if hide() or show() was applied ??
[03:53:30] <Cork> ?:visible
[03:53:31] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[03:53:57] <Cork> ph88: but as its based on if the element has display: none or not, its often better to use a class if you need this
[03:54:19] <ph88> oki thx
[04:08:58] <paulvd> hello, is there a jquery gallery or interface which will allow me to do what is done here, http://endlesscustomz.com/gallery/ like links to the left, and content to the right...clicking on link opens its own contents...
[04:12:39] <seutje> looks kinda like regular old tabs
[04:15:00] <seutje> lol, that gallery has "password protected" galleries
[04:15:27] <seutje> it promps u for the password when u click it, and then compares it to this global id_password object :')
[04:15:35] <seutje> prompts*
[04:23:30] <guy> suppose I have $('form').on('submit', function (e) {e.preventDefault();}); $('form').on('submit', function (e) { /* how to tell that the event was prevented */? });
[04:24:21] <guy> isDefaultPrevented
[04:32:43] <paulvd> seutje: i want something similar but just want the left area and right area
[04:34:04] <seutje> paulvd: so use jquery ui tabs or write ur own
[04:36:48] <vinex08> Is there any jquery plugin (or any other way) to force IE8 to show multiple background images?
[04:37:38] <seutje> vinex08: PIE does that
[04:37:46] <seutje> (read "tries to do that")
[04:37:58] <vinex08> PIE?
[04:39:02] <seutje> vinex08: http://css3pie.com/documentation/supported-css3-features/#pie-background
[04:40:29] <seutje> vinex08: for IE8, u could prolly abuse pseudos if u don't need more than 3 backgrounds
[04:40:45] <vinex08> you mean :after and :before
[04:40:50] <seutje> yeah
[04:41:59] <vinex08> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/multiple-bg
[04:42:03] <vinex08> what's this?
[04:42:54] <seutje> my guess would be "a jQuery plugin called 'multiple-bg'"
[04:43:10] <vinex08> lol
[04:44:14] <vinex08> thanks for the PIE info
[04:44:47] <seutje> vinex08: that plugin looks pretty brutal btw, it evaluates every single rule in ur CSS
[04:46:38] <vinex08> which one do you prefer then? PIE? pseudo or that brutal plugin?
[05:01:36] <hateIE> hm whoever said bootstrap is better then foundation the other day... upoun taking it for a Joyride ;) i have to agree
[05:05:50] <hateIE> still i have yet to see any thing out there that can beat foundations orbit for scaling/responsiveness tho.. which kind of pains me ... bootstraps carousel is like good and better in many respects but it screws up on scaling at really small screen sizes infact the whole frame work has trouble there
[05:06:15] <BMCouto> Hi
[05:07:18] <BMCouto> How can I create a template var, something like var xpto = '<div class="$i">foo</div>' and then give $i different value in a for loop?
[05:07:26] <hateIE> but then orbit wont layour right inside foundations grid, its become a real pickle and egg situation
[05:09:54] <BMCouto> How can I create a template var, something like var xpto = '<div class="$i">foo</div>' and then give $i different value in a for loop?
[05:11:07] <hateIE> BMCouto something like:
[05:11:08] <hateIE> for (i=0;i < maxstyles;i++) { xpto='div class="'+i+'"> food</div>'; }
[05:11:21] <Cork> ?g jquery.jqote @ BMCouto
[05:11:21] <b-ot> BMCouto: Sorry, no results for ‚Äüjquery.jqote @ BMCouto‚Äù.
[05:11:23] <bot-t> BMCouto, jQote ñ client-side templating : once upon my code - http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote/
[05:12:57] <vernonk> Underscore out of the question: http://underscorejs.org/#template
[05:13:03] <vernonk> ?
[05:13:09] <BMCouto> hateIE:  Cork I know that
[05:13:20] <BMCouto> but i want to be able to set the variable html first
[05:13:28] <BMCouto> and just fill it later on the for()
[05:13:55] <Cork> BMCouto: thats where the templating comes in
[05:14:22] <vernonk> Yeah, you're not really setting a var to replace you're creating a token of sorts that you replace.
[05:14:24] <Cork> jqote2 lets you get a template and then you can valuate it (it works like a small programming language)
[05:14:27] <BMCouto> vernonk:  underscore is amazing, but cant introduce it on this project now
[05:14:39] <vernonk> BMCounto ahhh‚Ä¶ agreed.
[05:15:34] <vernonk> Maybe something like:  var t = '<div id="%ID%">%VALUE%</div>';
[05:15:41] <BMCouto> Cork:  yeah thats what I want
[05:15:45] <Cork> BMCouto: then xpto.replace(/\$i/, i);
[05:15:50] <BMCouto> but cant i achieve that without plugins?
[05:15:58] <Cork> if you don't want to depend on a library
[05:16:15] <Cork> BMCouto: it gives you A LOT more power, but regex can do it
[05:16:45] <BMCouto> hmm the jqote plugin you mean?
[05:16:45] <seutje> regex could cure cancer
[05:17:02] <Cork> BMCouto: jqote is similar to underscore
[05:17:08] <Cork> i like its power more though
[05:17:21] <Cork> if you don't want to go with a full template syntax use regex
[05:17:35] <BMCouto> you prefer jqote to underscore? thats interesting
[05:17:42] <BMCouto> never heard of jqote before
[05:18:04] <seutje> `g jqote
[05:18:04] <b-ot> seutje: jQote ‚Äì client-side templating : once upon my code ‚Üí http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote/
[05:18:27] <Cork> hmm thats the old lib
[05:18:28] <seutje> it's like everything is a rewrite of John's micro-templating

[05:19:50] <seutje> u'd almost think it's just the templating abstracted from underscore
[05:19:54] <BMCouto> yeah i was checking that
[05:20:03] <BMCouto> gonna try it for sure
[05:20:34] <BMCouto> what about backbone? you guys use it?
[05:20:50] <seutje> doesn't rly serve the same purpose
[05:23:25] <BMCouto> seutje:  yeah I know, bacbone is for structuring your code right?
[05:25:23] <seutje> yeah, MVC
[05:25:45] <seutje> I usually use it along with underscore's template
[05:26:07] <seutje> well... "usually"... only have like 1 or 2 backbone apps in production
[05:39:51] <mieszkos_> hi, can anyone help me with tinymce?
[05:42:56] <Anticom> hi all
[05:42:57] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/3C24k/1/
[05:43:03] <Anticom> why doesn't this selector work?
[05:43:06] <Anticom> i just don't get it
[05:43:26] <Anticom> (testing in ff, win-xp 32bit)
[05:43:40] <ProXy> what do you want to do?
[05:44:04] <ProXy> you are searching for input fields. there are no inputs
[05:44:19] <mieszkos_> why i am getting after centring in tinymce plain text something like this <p  center;">my text</p>
[05:44:20] <Anticom> .____________.
[05:44:22] <Anticom> omg lol
[05:44:27] <Anticom> i obviously suck
[05:44:27] <Anticom> hahaha
[05:44:33] <Anticom> ok ty ProXy
[05:44:39] <ProXy> np :)
[05:44:40] <mieszkos_> anyone had this problem?
[05:45:40] <mieszkos_> :(
[05:46:09] <Anticom> mieszkos_ first of all nope i didn't and 2nd: why are you asking that in a jq channel?
[05:46:20] <Anticom> iirc there is a channel for tinymce
[05:46:41] <mieszkos_> dont know the channel. can u give me the name?
[05:47:23] <vernonk> #tinymce
[05:47:54] <seutje> sure it doesn't make that much sense!
[05:47:59] <seutje> surely* even
[05:48:33] <Anticom> mieszkos_ try #tinymce ?
[05:48:39] <seutje> mieszkos_: use the styles instead of the align buttons
[05:48:49] <seutje> they'll add classes instead of inline styles iirc
[05:49:31] <mieszkos_> it doesnt matter if im doing font size in tinymce for exmplame i will write Something
[05:49:38] <mieszkos_> and resize it to 24pt
[05:49:47] <mieszkos_> in tinymce view is ok
[05:49:50] <mieszkos_> but after save
[05:50:06] <mieszkos_> im not getting 24pt and in source i can see wrong code.
[05:50:39] <seutje> are u posting this to a system that does additional sanitation?
[05:50:46] <seutje> like say.... drupal?
[05:50:56] <seutje> for styles: http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Configuration:style_formats
[05:51:26] <Anticom> hmm i'm having some strange behaviour
[05:51:27] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/GPsug/2/
[05:51:39] <Anticom> when u click the reset button everything works fine except the first select
[05:51:47] <Anticom> that switches to 2nd option
[05:51:50] <Anticom> -->bug?
[05:52:22] <mieszkos_> seutje but why is this in tinymce view works good ?
[05:53:06] <seutje> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/GPsug/3/ ?
[05:53:29] <Anticom> seutje what's the difference?
[05:53:40] <seutje> attr and first-child
[05:53:44] <Anticom> :eq(0) should be :first-child, shouldn't it?
[05:53:49] <seutje> eq grabs first of the whole set
[05:53:55] <seutje> first child is first per parent
[05:53:56] <Anticom> oh does it?!
[05:54:00] <Anticom> hmm
[05:54:02] <seutje> yeah
[05:54:22] <seutje> and changed prop for attr since it's an attr u wanna change
[05:54:43] <Anticom> i rly need to get comfy with .prop
[05:54:54] <seutje> I'd cache that select selector though
[05:55:15] <Anticom> since it's a small table i don't care
[05:55:21] <Anticom> php storm is complaining aswell
[05:55:23] <Anticom> but who cares
[05:55:29] <Anticom> no one is running our app on an atari :D
[05:56:51] <seutje> actually, u could just chain it in 1 go http://jsfiddle.net/GPsug/6/
[05:57:20] <seutje> I'd also try to scope it to the form the reset button is in... but there is no form here :P
[06:09:46] <jeffsmykil> anyone around?
[06:14:05] <mrHat> <input type="hidden" name="store[2]" value="2" id="location" />  is it possible to replace 2 with something else ? i can to $('#location').val(something else) for the value but what about the name array
[06:14:42] <fabioportieri> .attr("name") ?
[06:15:33] <mrHat> so i cannot access whats inside [] ? need to replace the value of name entirely ?
[06:16:26] <aMoniker_> mrHat: you can get the value of name then use a regex or string replacement
[06:16:53] <mrHat> but that would be stupid
[06:17:16] <aMoniker_> mrHat: have a better idea?
[06:18:01] <mrHat> i was stupid for asking in the 1st place
[06:18:22] <aMoniker_> mrHat: yeah, curiosity is dumb.
[06:18:40] <SidFerreira> Guys, is there a way to make a post request but send na associative array instead of an object? the webservice Im contacting isn't recognizing the object as valid...
[06:19:05] <aMoniker_> SidFerreira: there are no associative arrays in js
[06:19:05] <jeffsmykil> are you sending it as valid json?
[06:19:28] <jeffsmykil> SidFerreira: are you stringifying it?
[06:21:12] <SidFerreira> mmm... let me explain a bit more...
[06:21:26] <jeffsmykil> what is there service written in?
[06:24:11] <pbor> hi! how do I force all items in a jqueryui buttonset() to have the same width? I tried simply mydiv.buttonset().equalWidths() and $('label', mydiv).equalWidths() but it did not work
[06:25:15] <SidFerreira> http://developers.mercadopago.com/documentation/receive-payments
[06:25:37] <SidFerreira> I want to use the JSON Post method
[06:26:05] <jeffsmykil> try stringify
[06:26:07] <jeffsmykil> see if that works
[06:26:22] <jeffsmykil> also jsonlint.com
[06:26:32] <SidFerreira> sorry being newbie, but, stringfy?
[06:27:12] <SidFerreira> ok, found it :)
[06:27:28] <jeffsmykil> JSON.stringify
[06:27:39] <jeffsmykil> i have to use it when I post to my webservices
[06:27:50] <jeffsmykil> didn't read all about that one so I'm not sure about yours
[06:27:53] <jeffsmykil> but worth a try
[06:28:28] <jeffsmykil> if you are supporting IE 7 you need to include json2.js
[06:28:33] <jeffsmykil> to use JSON.stringify
[06:28:53] <okdamn> hey i'm getting problems making sticky <footer> to the bottom on window resize
[06:29:02] <okdamn> how do i stick it to the bottom on window resize?
[06:31:07] <okdamn> the problem is i'm not using a container or wrapper
[06:31:10] <okdamn> and i can't
[06:32:28] <SidFerreira> jeffsmykil: Do I need any extra javascript to use this function?
[06:32:44] <ph88> how do i make a selection of a selection. Like this ? $('input[type="radio"]').$(":checked");   ?  (no i don't prefer to do it in the same string)
[06:32:48] <jeffsmykil> only if you need to support IE 7
[06:34:28] <ph88> do i have to use siblings()  ??
[06:35:56] <seutje> `api filter @ ph88

[06:36:13] <ph88> Perfect ! thx
[06:36:57] <seutje> ph88: it's actually better not to put that in the string, as it would cause the selector to need to be passed to sizzle instead of just using qSA
[06:37:59] <ph88> seutje:  put "that" ? "the string" ?  "sizzle" ?  "qSA" ??
[06:39:29] <seutje> ph88: "that" -> the ":selected", "the string" -> the selector ur passing to $(), "sizzle" -> jQuery's selector-engine, "qSA" -> native method for selecting elements

[06:40:52] <pachet> think it just doesnt parse out the @ user target
[06:40:54] <pachet> lol
[06:41:06] <seutje> yeah, completely ignored the first time u said that :P
[06:41:09] <bougie> why this function alert "undefined" on IE but show "0" on FX : http://paste.awesom.eu/BDY

[06:41:12] <seutje> surrie
[06:41:24] <bougie> the url give me 0 when I call it directly
[06:41:44] <Croves> What's the best solution to use instead of .parent() multiple times? I mean, I'm using $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().text(), and this doesn't sounds right lol
[06:41:57] <ph88> i did    var div = $("div");    and then later  div.filter(".test");

[06:43:25] <jeffsmykil> pachet: can I ask you a question in private?
[06:43:41] <Croves> .parents() seems cool. I'll take a look
[06:43:50] <pachet> jeffsmykil: sure
[06:43:57] <ph88> seutje: so i make  var div = document.querySelectorAll("div");    and then later  div.filter(".test");       and by that i used your improvement suggestion ?
[06:44:14] <seutje> sunbeam: use the global ajaxSuccess handler?
[06:44:15] <pachet> ph88: wat
[06:44:24] <seutje> ph88: no wait lol
[06:44:35] <bougie> seutje: How can I get it ?
[06:44:38] <pachet> ph88: that's ass backwards
[06:44:40] <sunbeam> seutje: how?  I currently do if($('.datepick').length > 0){ $('.datepick').datepicker(); }
[06:44:46] <bougie> it's just a php script which echo a number
[06:44:53] <pachet> ph88: for that, you'd just use document.getElementsByClassName('test')
[06:44:58] <pachet> but then again, this is #jquery
[06:44:59] <seutje> ph88: my point was that if the selector is "normal", jQuery will just pass it to qSA, but qSA doesn't understand ":checked", so the entire string gets parsed by sizzle instead
[06:45:40] <seutje> so ur better off creating a jQuery collection with a standardized selector and then calling filter on that with ur sizzle specific stuff
[06:45:43] <ph88> seutje: ooh you are saying i need to find a replacement for ":checked"  alltogether ??
[06:45:49] <seutje> no no
[06:46:32] <seutje> just don't put it in a large selector, abstract it and .filter(':checked') on it
[06:46:35] <seutje> I show u
[06:47:25] <seutje> of course, when testing it... $('input:checked') comes out faster than $('input').filter(':checked') -_-
[06:47:43] <seutje> so yeah... nevermind I guess
[06:47:53] <ph88> o_O
[06:48:48] <seutje> wtf, qSA learned :checked ?
[06:49:07] <ph88> var Tabs = $('input[type="radio"][name="tab"]');   Tabs.filter(':checked').attr('id');    <-- i am doing this to find the id of the current checked
[06:49:55] <seutje> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors3/#checked well I'll be damned
[06:50:17] <ph88> so i use Tabs.on("change" ....  then i go into a function and get the   checked one ... that's why i wanted to split it up  rather then doing: $('input[type="radio"][name="tab"]').on("change"....     and then again:  $('input[type="radio"][name="tab"]:checked').attr('id' ....
[06:50:40] <ph88> seutje: do you think i have more improvement to do there ? or i'm good to go ?
[06:52:06] <seutje> ph88: iono, do note that old IEs don't fire change on radios until u de-focus them
[06:52:25] <ph88> damn the old IE's ! :p
[06:52:30] <seutje> I usually add click and keyup to the change
[06:52:56] <ph88> ok i can make a click event instead ... on("click"  .. seems like a small change
[06:53:09] <seutje> don't remove change
[06:53:22] <seutje> .on('click keyup change', ...
[06:53:39] <ph88> ah i didn't know i could do that !
[06:53:59] <seutje> might still have a problem when clicking the label on IE(7) though
[06:54:07] <ph88> i'm only using the label
[06:54:15] <ph88> i have a display non on the checkbox itself
[06:54:21] <seutje> oh
[06:54:48] <seutje> then I don't think there's any point in binding click and keyup :P
[06:54:59] <ph88> eh ok :P
[06:55:16] <seutje> just make sure that triggering a radio by clicking the label fires change on the radio itself on old-IE
[06:55:33] <ph88> not sure how old i want to go yet ...
[06:55:42] <ph88> i guess i will see if it "breaks down" :P
[06:56:11] <ph88> talking about such ... is there any unit test possible on this stuff ?  not just by code but also emulate the user clicking with the mouse ?
[06:59:17] <pachet> ph88: if you're serious about it, i'd recommend doing headless testing with a dom testing framework like jsdom
[06:59:25] <pachet> but yes, it's definitely possible
[06:59:43] <pachet> if you google 'headless unit testing mocha jsdom' it should point you in the right direction
[06:59:50] <seutje> if u wanna test actual interaction and animation, selenium is an option
[06:59:59] <seutje> bit tedious to set up though
[07:00:35] <ph88> ok thx ... the JS right now is a bit noobie ... but i want to get it solid because the project will only get bigger and bigger
[07:03:09] <EdwardIII> hey, is there an event like change but for when an input has actually had it's content changed, rather than when it loses focus?
[07:03:30] <seutje> ph88: btw, if u don't mind my asking, why are u using radio elements as triggers for your tabs?
[07:03:50] <seutje> EdwardIII: that is change, unfortunately, some browsers only fire it on blur
[07:03:54] <ph88> seutje: so i can use the value of which tab was selected when i submit a form
[07:04:21] <EdwardIII> heh sucks, guess i'll have to add my own listener
[07:05:12] <seutje> EdwardIII: it also depends on what type of element
[07:05:25] <seutje> checkboxes and radios are sort of problematic in that regard
[07:06:24] <EdwardIII> i just need input boxes
[07:06:29] <EdwardIII> seutje: what about this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1481152/jquery-how-to-detect-a-textboxs-content-has-changed/15111970#15111970
[07:06:32] <seutje> also, I believe change doesn't properly bubble in IE
[07:06:54] <EdwardIII> good ol' IE
[07:07:37] <seutje> oh wait "For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus."
[07:07:52] <seutje> wait what, input event? o.O
[07:08:17] <seutje> I'm so behind :(
[07:08:25] <momomomomo> seutje: relax, and read the documentation.
[07:08:28] <seutje> EdwardIII: yeah, guess u can just use input
[07:08:45] <ph88> seutje: ha you veteran learn something :p
[07:08:45] <seutje> momomomomo: WAT?
[07:08:50] <momomomomo> seutje: http://api.jquery.com/change/
[07:09:01] <seutje> momomomomo: too late
[07:09:35] <momomomomo> What are you trying to do?
[07:09:50] <seutje> me?
[07:10:01] <seutje> trying to help out these fine ppl
[07:10:12] <momomomomo> maybe I misunderstood - was tabbing through the screens and thought you had the question haha.
[07:10:36] <EdwardIII> i'm just trying to trigger an event when the contents of an input changes
[07:10:51] <seutje> nah, I was just confused as I didn't know "input" was a standardized event type now
[07:11:06] <momomomomo> ah
[07:11:08] <momomomomo> right on
[07:11:17] <EdwardIII> i bet there's a web browser that it isn't a standard in heh
[07:11:22] <seutje> EdwardIII: input no workie? could always go for keyup
[07:11:24] <seutje> truth
[07:11:29] <seutje> bind to all the events!
[07:11:38] <seutje> if only .on('*' worked :P
[07:12:44] <EdwardIII> heh
[07:13:00] <EdwardIII> keyup doesn't trigger on paste or if JS changes the input's content directly
[07:13:09] <EdwardIII> but then it seems neither does input
[07:13:33] <bil> when using $selector.map(), is there a way to make it return a normal array object?
[07:15:23] <BillCriswell> bil: .get()
[07:16:37] <BillCriswell> $foo.map(...).get();
[07:16:49] <BillCriswell> Dammit, just closed a tab I needed.
[07:17:00] <BillCriswell> Yay history.
[07:17:46] <bil> thanks
[07:17:48] <bil> easy enough
[07:18:30] <seutje> BillCriswell: cmd+shift+t ftw!
[07:18:51] <seutje> even works after closing the entire browser and restarting it
[07:18:55] <seutje> or at least in chrome
[07:18:58] <BillCriswell> seutje: I was not aware of that. Sweet.
[07:20:03] <BillCriswell> bil: No problem!
[07:28:20] <xinming> anyone here can suggest me a jquery file uploader which is free and easy to use?
[07:28:31] <xinming> I saw fineuploader seems to be over complex these days
[07:35:44] <shwaiil> yo!
[07:37:10] <shwaiil> Q: For $.get(), if the response is "HTML", is it ok to append it directly to the dom ? Thanks for looking!
[07:39:56] <Gmac_> lol! I'm working on a wordpress site locally. i apparently forgot my password to the admin and tried too many times‚Ä¶..
[07:40:08] <Gmac_> now i have to wait 30 minutes till i can try again on my localhost
[07:40:53] <pachet> schwaiil: sure
[07:42:09] <masak> with the new and much-improved .on() method, should I still use specialized methods like .click()? is there a consensus guideline?
[07:42:27] <pachet> i feel that using .on() is the best practice
[07:42:34] <pachet> it's the easiest to modify/scale
[07:42:43] <pachet> it allows you to specify a namespace for your events
[07:43:19] <pachet> moreover those methods are overloaded
[07:43:23] <masak> yeah.
[07:43:26] <pachet> and overloaded methods are harder to read :[
[07:43:45] <masak> I'm writing a course. just thinking about which way to recomment first. but .on() it is, then.
[07:43:48] <masak> thanks, pachet++.
[07:43:58] <pachet> yw
[07:59:57] <danielc1234> Hi all trying to add a slider box using jquery and seem to be getting conflicts with my homepage slider. How would I troubleshoot something like that?
[08:02:12] <daslicht> how do you register to the jquerytools forum?
[08:02:25] <daslicht> how to search the forum ?
[08:02:33] <fris> i have a faq section with some show and hide, i want to toggle the previous one when a new one is clicked so they arent all opeened, here is the current code im using http://pastie.org/7301191
[08:02:34] <daslicht> therer is no register button
[08:03:05] <fris> here is a live version http://fris.net/faq/
[08:04:39] <daslicht> maybe you can add a data-state="open" to it
[08:05:45] <davesleep> how do i bind a function injquery
[08:06:07] <davesleep> so that it doesnt run when i bind it, but will be attached to it (so i can use the 'this' statement)
[08:06:19] <davesleep> it is will refer back
[08:08:38] <masak> davesleep: you can do that in pure JavaScript: fn.bind(obj) -- though the .bind method is ES5 and upwards.
[08:08:59] <masak> davesleep: probably you have to assume that clients use <ES5. but bind is easy to implement.
[08:09:18] <masak> davesleep: see https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[08:14:56] <Ore4444> I'm looking for an API, online service, jQuery plugin or a library that can parse a date and figure out if it's a special day or a holiday anywhere in the world. Any ideas?
[08:17:37] <kackl_000> I'm trying to use a jquery plugin to format currency (https://code.google.com/p/jquery-formatcurrency/).  All the examples on the page show how to format via a css selector, but I have a variable I'm trying to format.  The variable name is total.  total.formatCurrency(); doesn't seem to work nor does $(total).formatCurrency() does anyone have any ideas?

[08:39:41] <siovene> Hi. Is there a channel specifically for qunit?
[08:42:36] <siovene> I'll ask my question anyway: has anybody had issues with qunit's "asyncTest" in phantomjs? My asyncTests hang forever when run in phantomjs, but work fine in Chrome.
[08:50:41] <shadyKhan> im using jquery to addclas to an element but in IE8 it doesnt happen. anyone know why?
[08:52:26] <masak> shadyKhan: consider providing a small jsfiddle snippet of your problem.
[08:54:03] <masak> shadyKhan: as you may realize, the probability that jQuery's .addClass has a bug on IE8 is *blindingly* small.
[08:54:14] <masak> more likely, you took a wrong turn somewhere.
[08:54:30] <shadyKhan> how can i make a wrong turn with $('.filter').addClass('CityFound');
[08:54:31] <shadyKhan> lol
[08:54:38] <masak> you tell me.
[08:57:39] <masak> shadyKhan: do you see yellow on IE8? http://jsfiddle.net/4wKhL/
[08:58:24] <masak> (I do on Chrome v23.0.1271.64)
[08:59:17] <shadyKhan> masak: jsfiddle refuses to properly render in ie8
[09:00:10] <masak> sorry to hear that. can you at least see the HTML/JS/CSS?
[09:00:26] <masak> if you can, you should be able to reproduce the success I have here.
[09:00:50] <masak> if you can't, the HTML source may help.
[09:08:28] <nights> hm
[09:08:41] <nights> this line suddenly broke for me
[09:08:42] <nights> $('#ajaxZone .highlight_position').animate({ backgroundColor: "Transparent" }, 'fast');
[09:08:47] <nights> when installing jquery 1.9.1
[09:08:54] <nights> $('#ajaxZone .highlight_position').fadeOut()
[09:08:56] <nights> works fine
[09:09:00] <nights> any ideas?
[09:09:25] <aneki> nights
[09:09:28] <aneki> what are you trying to do
[09:09:35] <aneki> fade to transparency?
[09:10:01] <nights> hm
[09:10:08] <nights> when i add a new item to the cart
[09:10:19] <nights> i give that new item a class 'highlight_item'
[09:10:27] <aneki> ok
[09:10:28] <nights> it only contains a highlight color
[09:10:37] <aneki> ok
[09:10:42] <nights> then i call that line on the document ready to fade out that color
[09:10:47] <aneki> ok
[09:10:48] <nights> to transparent
[09:10:56] <nights> so customers can keep see the new item
[09:11:02] <nights> it worked until now
[09:11:07] <aneki> what did you chagne
[09:11:14] <nights> not sure
[09:11:18] <nights> but why would fadeOut() work
[09:11:20] <nights> but not animate
[09:11:21] <masak> nights: could you try a lower-case 't' in 'transparent' for me?
[09:11:25] <nights> sure
[09:11:32] <masak> just curious.
[09:11:47] <masak> might also be worthwhile to check the jQuery source to see how it implements .fadeOut()
[09:12:20] <nights> hm
[09:12:25] <nights> still doesnt work
[09:12:31] <nights> funny i dont understand why
[09:12:49] <nights> pretty unusual issue
[09:13:15] <aneki> nights: what did you change?
[09:13:53] <aneki> http://jsfiddle.net/rdWTE/248/
[09:13:55] <aneki> that works for me
[09:14:21] <aneki> it should be  $('#ajaxZone .highlight_position').animate({ 'background-color': "transparent" }, 'fast');
[09:14:25] <aneki> do you have a link?
[09:14:37] <BMCouto> is there any place where i can check in wich versions jquery deprecated something that may cause other plugins to stop working? i need to update from jquery 1.6.1 to at least 1.7.2 on an old site
[09:14:54] <aneki> BMCouto did u try the google
[09:15:05] <BMCouto> i did
[09:15:31] <BMCouto> i always try it first, if you can help i appreciate
[09:15:38] <BMCouto> if not, thanks for your time
[09:15:42] <aneki> http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/
[09:15:53] <aneki> that might be a good starting point
[09:16:12] <aneki> of course, you can also check each versions upgrade guide
[09:17:04] <BMCouto> aneki:  thats enough, thanks!
[09:17:12] <aneki> no prob
[09:17:17] <aneki> :)
[09:18:14] <nights> aneki: thanks. interestingly it still doesnt work
[09:18:18] <nights> wtf could be wrong
[09:18:20] <nights> getting confused
[09:19:44] <aneki> create a fiddle
[09:19:49] <aneki> http://jsfiddle.net
[09:23:35] <aneki> nights
[09:24:28] <aneki> r u there
[09:24:47] <rebrain> probably fiddlin'
[09:25:16] <aneki> when i cant stop me fiddlin i just takes me ritalin
[09:25:35] <rebrain> ^^
[09:27:45] <nights> aneki: yes sorry
[09:27:51] <nights> i didnt expect you to reply
[09:28:01] <nights> ok im trying to isolate now
[09:28:13] <nights> probably i will find the problem on the way
[09:28:15] <nights> but its weird
[09:28:26] <aneki> what are you doing
[09:30:29] <aneki> im going to choke you
[09:30:55] <soahccc> Any idea why a default tocify just find the first h1 but not the other h2&h3 before and after the h1
[09:32:03] <aneki> tocify?
[09:32:04] <rebrain> aneki: he probably refactoring code to not need to insert it fully into fiddle
[09:32:11] <rebrain> thus- isolating bits
[09:32:39] <soahccc> aneki: I thought it would be a common one :) http://gregfranko.com/jquery.tocify.js
[09:38:05] <nights> aneki: http://jsfiddle.net/6RUmE/
[09:38:15] <nights> though i couldnt even get fadeOut to work there
[09:38:42] <nights> oh i see its because i didnt select jquery
[09:38:52] <nights> http://jsfiddle.net/6RUmE/2/
[09:39:07] <nights> http://jsfiddle.net/6RUmE/3/
[09:39:08] <nights> so
[09:39:14] <nights> i guess it doesnt work like it should
[09:39:17] <nights> fadeout worked
[09:39:41] <nights> whats the issue? :S
[09:43:27] <aneki> hang on
[09:43:28] <aneki> looking
[09:44:23] <nights> its like
[09:46:02] <ezakimak> anyone here familiar with wijmo?
[09:46:43] <aneki> nights
[09:46:44] <aneki> you dolt
[09:46:50] <aneki> you need to include jquery-ui
[09:46:58] <nights> OH
[09:47:06] <nights> that explains
[09:47:10] <aneki> http://jsfiddle.net/6RUmE/11/
[09:47:12] <nights> i just removed jquery Ui
[09:47:19] * aneki slaps nights
[09:47:25] <nights> man
[09:47:30] <aneki> i assumed you would have at least left that
[09:47:31] <nights> that would have taken me hours to figure out lol
[09:47:39] <aneki> you cant animate colours without jquery ui
[09:47:43] <nights> i had no idea
[09:47:48] <aneki> now you know :)
[09:47:48] <nights> thought that was core jquery
[09:47:59] <nights> actually
[09:48:03] <xid> is there a way to void a hover function i have set on a selector?
[09:48:12] <xid> without deleting/commenting it
[09:48:17] <aneki> xid: what do you mean?
[09:48:28] <aneki> you mean unbind it?
[09:48:33] <nights> aneki: thanks so much
[09:48:36] <xid> $('.selector').hover(function(){})
[09:48:36] <xid> yes
[09:48:36] <nights> i can now rest
[09:48:40] <xid> unbind it
[09:48:47] <aneki> of course
[09:49:07] <xid> unbind(), thanks aneki
[09:49:11] <aneki> xid: are you using hover or mouseover
[09:49:20] <aneki> use $.unbind('hover');
[09:49:22] <aneki> yeah
[09:49:38] <lolhii> Can I force a textarea to only type over transparent parts of a background
[09:49:45] <lolhii> Similar to how http://www.someecards.com/usercards/create does it
[09:49:53] <lolhii> ie http://i.imgur.com/TnXIjjQ.png
[09:50:03] <lolhii> Wraps automatically to an image
[09:50:03] <lolhii> http://i.imgur.com/8Op2IAv.png
[09:50:05] <lolhii> And I have no idea how
[09:50:21] <lolhii> I don't see anything that defines where the image part is, vs transparent, so it must be a jqery plugin
[09:50:38] <aneki> lolhii: what ar eyou trying to do?
[09:50:46] <lolhii> Can I force a textarea to only type over transparent parts of a background
[09:51:16] <aneki> to only type over transparent parts of a background?
[09:51:19] <aneki> uhh
[09:51:23] <lolhii> yes
[09:51:30] <aneki> i dont quite follow
[09:51:32] <lolhii> Click the images i linked and youll understand.
[09:51:37] <aneki> i did
[09:51:42] <lolhii> And you dont understand..?
[09:51:57] <aneki> its jus ta text area that has a transparent bg
[09:52:09] <aneki> it takes the whole space
[09:52:20] <lolhii> no
[09:52:30] <aneki> yes
[09:52:33] <lolhii> the text a user types never overlays the character of the bg
[09:52:37] <lolhii> i want to know how
[09:53:07] <aneki> its javascript modifying the contents of the textarea
[09:53:10] <Eviltwin> lolhii: It looks like their code is manually inserting line breaks
[09:53:31] <lolhii> This is what i found that I think is related http://www.someecards.com/sec/scripts/creator/Utils.js
[09:53:35] <lolhii> I just can't tell for sure
[09:53:43] <Eviltwin> Notice how as you type it will start to overlap then break
[09:53:55] <lolhii> How does it know to break, is what i want to figure out
[09:53:56] <aneki> their js is detecting color variance
[09:54:05] <Andrew_R> lolhii: that site isn't using jQuery (not that you couldn't use it to duplicate the functionality)
[09:54:21] <lolhii> Andrew_R, they are, maybe not for this function though
[09:54:27] <aneki> the image has a dominant color, and as soon as the cursor is no longer over that color, it inserts a break
[09:54:40] <lolhii> cursor doesn't matter here, aneki
[09:54:57] <lolhii> mouse cursor vs keyboard blinker, i think you meant blinker?
[09:55:19] <lolhii> that would make sense
[09:55:19] <aneki> cursor can be the keyboard piece too
[09:55:25] <aneki> apparently you were born after 1990
[09:56:02] <lolhii> I was yes
[09:56:14] <lolhii> I live in the now, and adapt new technologies
[09:56:18] <lolhii> You could too
[09:56:22] <aneki> cursor is defined as 'insertion point'
[09:56:36] <lolhii> I won't argue semantics, i don't really care
[09:56:42] <lolhii> Color variance is a good idea though, thanks!
[09:57:01] <aneki> semantics? just because i was born in the 70s doesnt mean i dont embrace new technologies
[09:57:31] <aneki> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(computers)
[09:57:34] <lolhii> Ok
[09:57:43] <lolhii> Like I said, I don't care xD
[09:57:50] <aneki> well maybe you should
[09:57:57] <aneki> you may need to use a shell at some point in your life
[09:58:01] <lolhii> No thanks
[09:58:06] <Eviltwin> lolhii: I think it happens in the run function here: http://www.someecards.com/sec/scripts/creator/UserCard.011.js
[09:58:18] <lolhii> Eviltwin, isn't this it? http://www.someecards.com/sec/scripts/creator/Utils.js
[09:58:30] <Eviltwin> I'm seeing things like "var wordLength = this.ugcCard.textContext.measureText(word).width;" here
[09:58:31] <lolhii> They check rgb values there
[09:58:41] <Eviltwin> And the insertion of new lines
[09:58:47] <lolhii> Hm
[09:58:57] <lolhii> No I think that's to do with limiting the amount of characters in a card
[09:59:01] <lolhii> Although
[09:59:04] <lolhii> I do see getRGBA
[09:59:16] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I think it's using the Utils.js
[09:59:21] <Eviltwin> But I think the actual work is happening in that run function
[09:59:31] <lolhii> Yes I think you're right
[10:01:26] <lolhii> Yeah starts at for (var i in words) {
[10:02:40] <Eviltwin> ...
[10:02:48] <Eviltwin> Sorry, wrong window
[10:02:51] <lolhii> =P
[10:02:52] <Eviltwin> Yeah, it's definitely in here
[10:03:06] <lolhii> Cool, thanks!
[10:04:01] <scrieler> do u know top_up? my image window jumps arround in gallery, my video position is correct...
[10:11:22] <shwaiil> Q: I'm setting some names functions as callbacks inside another fn. I know what to do when it's only one, but storing each named function and then call it, I don't. How to do that ? thanks!
[10:12:46] <masak> what do you guys recommend instead of the deprecated two-argument .toggle event binder?
[10:13:03] <shwaiil> masak: .toggle is deprecated ?!?!
[10:14:30] <masak> shwaiil: note: there are two .toggle methods :)
[10:14:34] <shwaiil> for my question is the answer using eval(fnName + "()"); ? I remember reading that eval should be avoided.
[10:14:47] <masak> shwaiil: the one-arg one is not deprecated.
[10:15:03] <shwaiil> masak: $(window).toggle('resize'); you say ?
[10:15:16] <masak> right, that one is still fine.
[10:15:25] <masak> but http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/ doesn't suggest a good-practice alternative to .toggle(fn1, fn2)
[10:15:49] <shwaiil> masak: you know anything about named functions ? I'd like to send named functions as callback functions to another fn
[10:15:56] <shwaiil> but not sure how to execute it, unless using eval
[10:17:01] <masak> hm. do you mean simply somefunction(someNamedFunction) ?
[10:18:42] <shwaiil> like sayHello(params) { doSomething(); whenFinishRunAll-listOfFunctionsHere(); }; so I send sayHello({ 'listOfFunctionsHere' : ['fn1', 'fn2', 'fn3'] })
[10:18:46] <shwaiil> masak:
[10:19:28] <masak> shwaiil: don't send 'fn1', because then you have to do eval. send fn1, the function name, instead.
[10:20:02] <masak> that's literally the name, without a () after it. if you leave out the (), then you send the funcation itself, rather than calling it there and then.
[10:20:05] <masak> which is what you want.
[10:21:10] <shwaiil> masak: right, so to call it what should I do then ? $.each(params.list, function(k,v) { v(); }); ?!?!?!
[10:21:26] <shwaiil> something like this ?!
[10:22:32] <masak> you don't need to involve jQuery in this. this is purely a JavaScript solution.
[10:22:56] <masak> loop over params.list -- each element will be a function. pull out that element, and call it.
[10:23:08] <masak> you can use an ordinary 'for' loop for it. no need for .each
[10:23:44] <shwaiil> yeh, but just to be clear, in this case, all I had to do would be something like that ?! adding the () to the element ?!
[10:24:08] <shwaiil> like in the for loop, arr[i]() ?!
[10:24:16] <shwaiil> array[i]()
[10:25:21] <masak> yep.
[10:25:24] <shwaiil> oh ok thanks = )
[10:25:24] <masak> you got it.
[10:25:29] <masak> good luck. :)
[10:26:35] <masak> shwaiil: if I may be so bold as to recommend http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript -- it teaches a lot of things like this.
[10:26:40] <masak> and it's free.
[10:27:27] <shwaiil> masak: yeh know about it actually
[10:29:16] <masak> then do it! :D
[10:30:51] <fulminator> hello, please help on this one: http://jsfiddle.net/5nfLd/2/
[10:35:05] <TheSisb> fulminator what is wrong
[10:36:39] <xec> fulminator: you could just set "top" and "left" values to 0
[10:36:45] <fulminator> well, I want to reset the positions on button click
[10:37:39] <fulminator> the div that is draggable must come to it's initial position when reset() occurs
[10:37:43] <fulminator> or another event
[10:37:58] <xec> fulminator: not the most elegant solution, but i dont think there is a "reset position" method built in with draggable http://jsfiddle.net/5nfLd/4/
[10:38:27] <fulminator> I have search the net but no luck; I want to revert:valid when button click and rest of the time to revert:invalid
[10:39:52] <fulminator> xec: it's very interesting solution, but it's relative to parent or it's a working hack?
[10:40:28] <xec> fulminator: draggables get position: relative; so top/left 0 = original position
[10:42:11] <xec> fulminator: top/left values is how draggables work, so its not too hackish
[10:43:44] <ronanv> Anyone know of a jQuery treeview?  Checked http://jqueryui.com but not able to locate.

[10:51:32] <Danielc1234> Hi all seem to have a conflict with my jquery, so I put this in the <head> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> var sliderbox = jQuery.noConflict(true); </script>     and then started my call to it in my document   sliderbox(function($) {       But doesnt seem to work. What am I doing wrong?
[11:00:35] <Danielc1234> do I need to use a $ in order to set the variable?
[11:00:36] <slackz> What's the best way to send large chunks of XML text (possibly a 1000 line fully valid XML document) from a form textarea via an ajax call to a PHP script running on the server?
[11:02:09] <defaulto|away> hey folks, am I right that we can build our jquery mobile app even when we use PHP?
[11:02:23] <ldlework> defaulto|away: jquery is a client side javascript library
[11:02:28] <defaulto|away> it's because the example I've downloaded last night only used html
[11:02:31] <ldlework> PHP is a server-side programming language..
[11:02:40] <defaulto|away> got it so it should be fine
[11:02:40] <Hyperhtml> ^
[11:04:30] <ezakimak> slackz, it's just data. send it.
[11:04:31] <defaulto|away> so most of the things I've been doing in jquery should work in jquery mobile. One is calling ajax to post to a form. COrrect?
[11:04:51] <fulminator> xec ty very much!
[11:05:06] <ezakimak> you don't post to a form
[11:05:15] <defaulto|away> ?
[11:05:19] <ezakimak> a form does the posting
[11:05:32] <defaulto|away> that's what I mean, POST method
[11:06:03] <defaulto|away> so it's the jquery mobile that prepares the output to our phone device
[11:06:13] <defaulto|away> viewport perse
[11:06:50] <defaulto|away> i haven't tried this. IT will be a .php extension but it's doctype for html5. That should work right?
[11:07:14] <ezakimak> you are talking about two independent things
[11:07:35] <sanbor> hello there
[11:07:38] <defaulto|away> html5 is the format
[11:07:46] <masak> sanbor: greetings.
[11:08:05] <sanbor> this is the correct channel for a jquery ui question?
[11:08:23] <defaulto|away> the reason I was asking ezakimak is because I was worried if our mobile device will be able to properly connect to a php file. I think it will be fine since php is server side
[11:08:26] <ezakimak> sanbor, dunno about 'correct' but the jquery-ui channel is pretty dead--best bet is here
[11:08:49] <ezakimak> you don't "connect" to a "php file"
[11:08:53] <sanbor> got it ezakimak
[11:09:08] <ezakimak> you talk http to the server. how that server responds is independent and a black box
[11:09:41] <defaulto|away> k, sorry for short cutting
[11:09:55] <defaulto|away> php module loaded by httpd allows the document to be parsed
[11:10:28] <defaulto|away> that means, either my extension is .php for my jquery mobile project should be fine
[11:10:50] <ezakimak> yes, jq doesn't care what's in the url path
[11:11:13] <defaulto|away> cool
[11:11:19] <defaulto|away> thanks a lot!
[11:11:21] <ezakimak> it may care about headers returned, eg content-type
[11:11:27] <defaulto|away> k
[11:11:40] <ezakimak> although i'm pretty sure you can override that
[11:11:41] <defaulto|away> i'll be watchful for those
[11:11:45] <defaulto|away> yup
[11:13:10] <defaulto|away> btw, I installed Eclipse with PDT(for php) and Aptana plugins. This should be enough to get my programming exercises started. What do you think?
[11:13:33] <ezakimak> dunno about those--i just use emacs
[11:13:52] <defaulto|away> :)
[11:14:53] <codacoder> hey everyone
[11:15:17] <codacoder> anyone know if there's a jQ fn that filters stuff out?
[11:15:31] <ezakimak> filter how?
[11:15:40] <codacoder> .filter() is actually a sieve
[11:16:23] <ezakimak> googling shows: filtering, content filter, basic filter, visibility filter, child filter links
[11:16:26] <codacoder> I want the opposite of what .filter() d
[11:16:38] <codacoder> *does
[11:16:53] <ezakimak> so just invert the test
[11:17:02] <codacoder> .not() ?
[11:17:28] <aneki> can you pass a jquery selector an array of elements to animate?
[11:17:37] <ezakimak> your problem statement thus far is too vague for me to really help
[11:17:57] <codacoder> I want to filter things out of the matched set of elements
[11:18:07] <ezakimak> you mean keep them or discard them?
[11:18:11] <codacoder> that, in English, is what filter means
[11:18:36] <codacoder> sieve means keep - it's unfortunate that filter was used "badly" in this context
[11:18:59] <codacoder> so...
[11:19:09] <ezakimak> a filter keeps some stuff on one side, and lets other stuff pass through--it doesn't specify which side you want to work with after the action has occured
[11:19:11] <codacoder> let's say I did $(".X")
[11:19:26] <codacoder> now filter out of that set "div"
[11:19:34] <pythonirc101> I need a file folder interface to a folder on the server. Is there something like that for jquery available?
[11:19:35] <codacoder> leaving behind all else
[11:20:19] <codacoder> make sense?
[11:21:01] <ezakimak> $(".X").filter(function() { return this.nodeName() != 'div'; })
[11:21:12] <ezakimak> or == 'div' if that's backwards
[11:21:47] <ezakimak> the former seems correct given what the docs say
[11:22:18] <codacoder> $(".X").filter("div") would be nicer but it's wrong
[11:22:23] <ezakimak> pythonirc101, well, jq is client side. you may want to do webdav, and search for a jq plugin for webdav maybe
[11:22:58] <ezakimak> try filter("<div>") ?
[11:23:03] <aneki> is there a way to store a bunch of Jquery objects in an array and then animate them all at once?
[11:23:33] <ezakimak> jq selectors return an array (of sorts) already
[11:23:41] <codacoder> aneki: isn't that how it works already?
[11:23:42] <ezakimak> just call .animate(...) on the result
[11:23:48] <codacoder> yep
[11:24:01] <aneki> no
[11:24:07] <codacoder> why?
[11:24:09] <aneki> i have an variable array
[11:24:15] <aneki> var arr = [];
[11:24:31] <aneki> then i do arr.push( $element ); multiple times
[11:24:39] <aneki> i want to take all those items and slideup/dwon
[11:24:47] <masak> codacoder: you can easily define a plugin .Fil that will allow .Fil("div") to work the way you want.
[11:25:02] <codacoder> there's a jQ fn for that - cant remember what it's called
[11:25:12] <aneki> great
[11:25:16] <aneki> well that helps :P
[11:25:17] <codacoder> masak: yeah, i know
[11:25:18] <Quest> Javascript is single threaded. Is there a way to run a function every 5 seconds for ever and keep on doing the rest of JS / jQuery its job in a normal way?
[11:25:29] <ezakimak> aneki, so why not just loop over the array? it's gonna get looped over one way or another
[11:25:43] <ezakimak> Quest, sure. setTimeout()
[11:26:03] <codacoder> Quest needs setInterval
[11:26:08] <ezakimak> er setinterval
[11:26:09] <Quest> ezakimak,  is there a working example? codacoder
[11:26:17] <aneki> because i need to animate them simultaneously
[11:26:23] <ezakimak> google has plenty
[11:26:32] <codacoder> simultaneous is an illusion
[11:26:49] <shoky> aneki:  var elems = $(); elems.add( $element ); ...; elems.animate(...);      or if your $element's are not jquery objects but plain DOM elements you can just do $(arr).animate(...)
[11:26:59] <aneki> thanks
[11:27:04] <aneki> let me try that
[11:28:16] <shoky> aneki: but if you just loop over the array and animate each element, it'll be animation in parallel anyway
[11:28:17] <aneki> oh symfony why do you woe me so
[11:28:20] <shoky> like ezakimak suggested
[11:28:42] <shoky> that's what elems.animate(...) will do anyway
[11:29:17] <aneki> im going to just be ignorant when i get asked about it
[11:29:19] <aneki> anyways
[11:31:10] <aneki> it didnt work
[11:31:24] <Quest> ezakimak,  codacoder  if JS is single threaded. how can I function be looping for ever in a seperate thread and the rest of JS working as normal?
[11:32:33] <ezakimak> it's not a separate thread.
[11:32:38] <ezakimak> js is interrupt driven
[11:33:29] <ezakimak> then the interval fires, it will stop the main thread at the next sequence point in the vm, set up the appropriate scope chain and call the registered handler function. once that handler returns, it will resume where it stopped
[11:33:33] <ezakimak> *when
[11:35:36] <ezakimak> you do not want to busy wait
[11:35:45] <ezakimak> in js or any language
[11:37:53] <aneki> shoky
[11:37:54] <aneki> you there
[11:38:14] <shoky> yep
[11:38:46] <aneki> when i added all those items, it doesnt hide them when i run it
[11:38:54] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[11:38:59] <aneki> k hang on
[11:40:34] <aneki> http://jsfiddle.net/barrychapman/9jTVP/128
[11:41:45] <Quest> can any one tell a script that alerts hellow world every 5 seconds? and it allows the rest of JS/jQuery work as normal?
[11:41:51] <shoky> eh
[11:41:59] <aneki> the two drop downs up top
[11:42:00] <shoky> aneki that's rather long :\
[11:42:02] <slackz> http://jsfiddle.net/fUxS7/  --  I have two query ajax call examples there. I can access $_POST via PHP in the first, but the second, $_POST is empty. Any help why?
[11:42:04] <aneki> do you currently own or rent your home
[11:42:12] <aneki> and the thinking of buying
[11:42:16] <aneki> are the two that run the function
[11:42:35] <aneki> ok ill trim some shit out
[11:42:36] <aneki> hold on
[11:43:08] <aneki> same url, except its revision 130
[11:43:28] <aneki> shoot nevermind
[11:43:30] <aneki> forget it
[11:43:44] <shoky> all of it?
[11:44:08] <aneki> all of it what
[11:44:28] <shoky> did you mean forget all of it, or just 130
[11:44:44] <aneki> 130, but if you are busy dont worry about it
[11:44:51] <aneki> i just dont know why this selector isnt working
[11:45:08] <shoky> ill have company in about 2 min
[11:45:45] <aneki> if you have a second, open your console
[11:46:06] <aneki> and select something from the top dropdown
[11:46:30] <ezakimak> Quest: use window.setInterval(function() { console.log('hello world'); }, 5000)
[11:46:47] <Quest> ezakimak,  window?
[11:46:52] <shoky> aneki ok
[11:47:10] <Quest> ezakimak,  why window? and will it make the rest of JS work normally?
[11:47:25] <ezakimak> you can omit window.
[11:47:33] <ThaMrX> Hey, can anyone help me with awkward showcase plugin?
[11:47:38] <ezakimak> how would it prevent js from working normally?
[11:47:52] <aneki> select a drop down item
[11:47:55] <shoky> aneki: i see one thing wrong so far, you're using .on() wrong
[11:47:56] <aneki> and see the items in the console
[11:48:00] <aneki> how
[11:48:26] <defaulto|away> quick question guys, what's the purpose of declaring the jquery mobile and jquery mobile min inside a single html? Former is link rel and latter is script scr
[11:48:26] <ThaMrX> I want the thumbnails to show in div id rightbar here : http://145.37.208.96/308923/portfolio/portfolio.html
[11:48:46] <shoky> aneki: $(document.body).on('change', $element, function...    you can't put a jquery object ($element) instead of the selector ... i think
[11:48:55] <ezakimak> afaik you don't load js via link rel
[11:49:18] <defaulto|away> this is what I meant, why the coder  placed them both
[11:49:19] <defaulto|away> <link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery.mobile-1.0.1.css" />
[11:49:19] <defaulto|away> 	<script src="js/jquery.mobile-1.0.1.min.js"></script>
[11:49:27] <ezakimak> css is not javascript.
[11:49:29] <defaulto|away> omg
[11:49:31] <defaulto|away> it's css
[11:49:32] <defaulto|away> lol
[11:49:38] <defaulto|away> :D hehehe
[11:49:45] <ezakimak> someone needs more coffee
[11:49:49] <defaulto|away> hahaha
[11:49:50] <ezakimak> ;)
[11:50:31] <defaulto|away> looks like my friend is right that I need reading glasses. My vision is still sharp though but when I used his reading glasses, it's a different view.
[11:51:18] <ThaMrX> I want the thumbnails to show in div id rightbar here : http://145.37.208.96/308923/portfolio/portfolio.html
[11:51:34] <aneki> shoky: it works fine
[11:51:37] <aneki> you can do that
[11:51:38] <ThaMrX> I use awkward showcase
[11:52:06] <defaulto|away> i'm also worried about my memory. Yesterday, I spoke to Uverse around 10am. then I slept from 5pm to 7pm. Then wife asked me to contact Uverse again. And we had an argument and I told her that I spoke to Uverse 2 days ago. When we looked at the call history, she was right
[11:52:53] <aneki> that makes no sense
[11:53:28] <shoky> aneki: no, it doesn't work
[11:53:56] <shoky> aneki:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TYXbA/
[11:54:11] <shoky> click any input...
[11:54:19] <ezakimak> you're only crazy if you don't think you are
[11:54:52] <aneki> ah
[11:54:59] <langworthy1> Why can't I check for click() on a select element? http://jsfiddle.net/sprice/FXT4q/1/
[11:55:09] <shoky> aneki: or click anywhere in <body>
[11:55:18] <Quest> ezakimak,  thanks! setInterval is not recomended. can you put the same for setTimeout?
[11:55:19] <shoky> (to the right of the inputs)
[11:56:07] <aneki> doof
[11:56:15] <aneki> ok i can fix that
[11:56:18] <aneki> anyways
[11:56:18] <ezakimak> Quest, try: var hw = function() { console.log('hello world'); setTimeout(hw, 5000); }; hw();
[11:56:30] <aneki> why is the collection of objects not hiding/showing
[11:56:32] <mukaman> hello gentlemen
[11:56:54] <shoky> sry aneki, gtg
[11:57:33] <aneki> ok
[11:57:35] <aneki> ttyl
[11:59:03] <mukaman> can someone give me some small jquery help about an issue im having? can i explain it on the general chat?
[11:59:24] <shortcutmedia> yes go ahead
[12:00:11] <amaninacan> go.
[12:00:50] <mukaman> ok so if you enter http://mr.vicetto.com , and select the 'Isometrix' theme on the topbar options. You will reach a colorful theme. Then if you clicl ALL WORKS, it will move up, but if you click again ALL WORKS to close it. The position is not right! : (
[12:00:50] <Quest> ezakimak,  great. thanks
[12:01:42] <Quest> ezakimak,  there shouldnt be a ; before hw() and before } ?
[12:01:55] <Quest> in var hw = function() { console.log('hello world'); setTimeout(hw, 5000); }; hw();
[12:03:17] <ezakimak> ; is a statement separator. use that or a newline
[12:03:36] <Quest> ezakimak,  by the way.  setTimeout(hw, 0);  is even slow
[12:03:46] <Quest> ezakimak, ok
[12:03:56] <ezakimak> a timeout of 0 is essentially a while 1 loop
[12:04:01] <ezakimak> yes, it will be slow
[12:04:33] <anew> anyone using cycle2? how can i cycle images on hover?
[12:04:46] <Quest> ezakimak,  why not fast?
[12:05:22] <ezakimak> well, it should print a lot of hello worlds to your console
[12:05:37] <ezakimak> not leave much time for anything else
[12:06:47] <Quest> hm
[12:07:12] <dcherman> ezakimak: it's not equivalent to while(1) since it'll allow the next tick of the event loop to occur
[12:07:33] <shortcutmedia> mukaman, in what browser is the issue ?
[12:07:41] <shortcutmedia> it's okay in chrome
[12:07:49] <mukaman> its not an issue
[12:07:52] <mukaman> in firefox
[12:08:10] <ezakimak> i didn't say equivalent, merely essentially (thinking performance wise)
[12:08:23] <mukaman> when the all works slide closes the site is not propertly aligned in the top
[12:08:46] <ezakimak> it doesn't block completely, but it may slow everything to a crawl
[12:08:50] <mukaman> its not the initial state
[12:09:59] <mukaman> do you know what i mean shortcutmedia
[12:10:41] <mukaman> the closing action does not re position the acordion in its initial state
[12:11:25] <shortcutmedia> mukaman, what's your script for collapse/expand
[12:11:37] <aneki> ok, that doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/barrychapman/nRfLQ/2
[12:12:13] <shortcutmedia> mukaman, just do slideDown
[12:12:23] <shortcutmedia> you are animating html, and body
[12:12:25] <shortcutmedia> that's your problem
[12:12:31] <mukaman> $(this).next().slideDown('normal');
[12:13:00] <mukaman> it slides AlmostDown
[12:13:11] <mukaman> so im clueless
[12:14:48] <shortcutmedia> addEventListener on click to slideToggle the desired div
[12:14:48] <shortcutmedia> do not animate the html and body
[12:14:48] <shortcutmedia> and it will be fine
[12:14:48] <shortcutmedia> mukaman,
[12:14:48] <shortcutmedia> $('.matrixAll').click(function() { $(".matrixStuffin").slideToggle(); });
[12:14:48] <shortcutmedia> that's what you need
[12:15:49] <shortcutmedia> mukaman, comment your previeos code and add $('.matrixAll').click(function() { $(".matrixStuffin").slideToggle(); });
[12:15:53] <shortcutmedia> brb
[12:18:06] <mukaman> i just did shortcutmedia , can you check it?
[12:18:48] <mukaman> looks cool though
[12:19:35] <mukaman> lol
[12:21:38] <mukaman_> shortcutmedia: doesnt work... the accordion goes crazy now haha

[12:39:46] <anew> can anyone help
[12:39:52] <halcyon1234> If I do $.ajax{data... done...}, is there any way of accessing "data" in the function called by "done"?
[12:40:22] <halcyon1234> Mainly: I want to be able to tell "done" how to find the element that triggered the ajax call, so I can modify that element appropriately.
[12:42:44] <ezakimak> halcyon1234, if the api doesn't already provide a means, you could wrap what you pass to ajax() in a closure right there
[12:46:56] <shortcutmedia> halcyon1234, this ?
[12:46:57] <mukaman> shortcutmedia:  , FIXED it!
[12:47:02] <mukaman> :D
[12:47:04] <shortcutmedia> mukaman, horay
[12:47:06] <mukaman> some css..
[12:47:09] <shortcutmedia> :D
[12:47:12] <mukaman> did the job
[12:47:19] <mukaman> thanks a lot anyway i love you
[12:47:31] <shortcutmedia> glad u did it :D
[12:47:37] <aneki> is there  a function that executes after $.each is done iterating?
[12:47:47] <mukaman> awe bruder
[12:49:39] <fris> im doing a faq section, and when you click on a new question i want the previous to collapse here is what i have http://pastie.org/7304603 and the live version is at http://fris.net/faq/
[12:50:05] <dcherman> aneki: $.each is synchronous, just do whatever you want in the next statement
[12:50:13] <halcyon1234> anew: I can see in the console that the "resume" event is firing. You might want to check the cycle documentation.
[12:50:28] <aneki> ugg
[12:50:37] <anew> thanks halcyon1234
[12:50:38] <aneki> each is kicking off a bunch of animations
[12:50:45] <aneki> i want to run sometyhing when the anims are done
[12:50:55] <mukaman> wish you all a good day, bye!
[12:51:13] <dcherman> aneki: that's different then.  i'm assuming these animations are on different elements?
[12:51:42] <aneki> ya
[12:54:20] <schalkneethling> anyone here who uses flot or can point me to an IRC channel where flot devs and/or users are?
[12:54:40] <fris> nothing in #flot ?
[12:54:50] <dcherman> aneki: using a custom ?deferred is likely your best bet then
[12:55:15] <halcyon1234> ezakimak: I'll admit that answer went over my head. I *think* I know what you mean. Something like this: http://www.stefanolocati.it/blog/?p=1413
[12:55:16] <schalkneethling> fris: nope
[12:55:46] <c0d3rg1rl> ajax-question, how can I pass variables which start with a number like '3.foo' via "data"? .ajax({ ... data: { foo1: 'bar', foo2: 'bla', '3.foo': 'xxx' } ... }) - foo1 works, foo2 works, 3.foo does not work
[12:56:02] <halcyon1234> Instead of done: success(stanard vars)... do this done: customfunction(variable) returns successFunction(standard vars) { DoSomethingWith variable}
[12:57:14] <yogurt_truck> c0d3rg1rl: enclose them in quotes. object keys without quotes must be valid JS identifiers, otherwise they should be in quotes
[12:57:34] <c0d3rg1rl> yogurt_truck: I put it in quotes like: '3.foo': 'xxx'
[12:58:14] <ezakimak> halcyon1234, done: function(std vars) { call_your_success_fn(data, any_other_args...); }
[12:58:39] <yogurt_truck> c0d3rg1rl: yes
[12:58:54] <c0d3rg1rl> yogurt_truck: I have already done that, see my example line
[12:59:13] <halcyon1234> Great, I get it now. Thanks for the pointer, ezakimak.
[12:59:36] <yogurt_truck> c0d3rg1rl: so what's the exact error you're getting?
[13:01:39] <c0d3rg1rl> yogurt_truck: it seems the variable is not passed to php on server.
[13:01:42] <iowahc> hy there. I got some problem with the .animate() function. I get no smooth animation. I am trying to set opacity and margins of an image (to let it fly to a specific point). but the animation starts slow and ends fast (easing is set to linear).
[13:02:19] <c0d3rg1rl> yogurt_truck: I took a look at the request itself now, obviously the variable is sent to server but $_GET['3.foo'] is empty. Weird!
[13:03:05] <ezakimak> c0d3rg1rl, what data type are you telling ajax to use?
[13:04:09] <ezakimak> may be a php problem
[13:04:25] <yogurt_truck> c0d3rg1rl: aren't you POSTing?
[13:04:49] <ezakimak> $_POST['3.foo'] ?
[13:05:10] <c0d3rg1rl> ezakimak: I use xml via GET. But it seems that the problem is my ajax-server, jquery sends the variable but server does not see these variables, I just tried server/ajax.php?3.foo=xxx and it is NOT in $_GET[]
[13:05:38] <ezakimak> you may need to url encode the '.'
[13:06:12] <ezakimak> you probably want dataType as json rather than xml
[13:06:29] <ezakimak> but that only affects receiving
[13:07:17] <ezakimak> do you have any url rewrite rules enabled?
[13:07:59] <ezakimak> some bad regex might see 3.foo as a filename with extension .foo
[13:08:15] <c0d3rg1rl> ezakimak: no, I get an xml response, and no rewrite rules. and encoding is not the problem. jquery obviously works fine, the problem seems to be the php-server
[13:08:15] <ezakimak> oh. nm. you said the ajax.php is being called
[13:08:53] <c0d3rg1rl> If I directly call server/ajax.php?3.foo=xxx in browser, then $_GET['3.foo'] is not set in php
[13:09:14] <ezakimak> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1057622/dot-in-variable-name
[13:09:16] <c0d3rg1rl> so it seems that can't be  jquerys fault, thanks anyway.
[13:09:52] <c0d3rg1rl> ezakimak: ah, that seems to be the solution! thanks a lot!
[13:09:58] <iowahc> anyone else have stuttering / unsmooth animation?
[13:10:06] <c0d3rg1rl> php never fails to amaze me...
[13:10:09] <ezakimak> $_GET['3_foo'] should work, but you now need to worry about colliding var names since it rewrites it for you
[13:10:16] <ezakimak> don't have a 3.foo and a 3_foo together
[13:10:31] <ezakimak> php is attrocious on many levels
[13:10:34] <spobat> is there an easy way to increase the width: of an element by 30%?
[13:10:53] <ezakimak> put more in it?
[13:11:02] <ezakimak> j/k
[13:11:15] <c0d3rg1rl> ezakimak: $_GET['3_foo'] works as expected, thanks.
[13:11:23] <c0d3rg1rl> yogurt_truck: thanks as well & bye
[13:20:44] <mllie> Hello
[13:21:12] <mllie> I'm having problem with flexslider, it takes 100% height and no images are shown. Any idea?
[13:21:28] <mllie> http://flexslider.woothemes.com/index.html that is what I've inserted
[13:21:39] <ezakimak> just a wag but make sure your img urls work
[13:22:46] <mllie> ezakimak: it does
[13:23:42] <mllie> ezakimak: it looks more like .flex-viewport is 0px wide and high
[13:24:40] <ezakimak> can you get it to work by itself on an otherwise empty page?
[13:24:51] <aneki> if i have a show() with a callback inside a parent function, how do i return true out of that parent function?
[13:25:28] <ezakimak> aneki, that is an ambiguous question. pastebin some code
[13:27:30] <aneki> http://jsfiddle.net/9tYS3/
[13:27:37] <aneki> dont explain to me why it doesnt alert, i know why it doesnt
[13:27:41] <aneki> but thats the concept i am going for
[13:27:57] <aneki> i want testanim() to return true when it is done animating
[13:29:42] <ezakimak> you cannot do it that way. callbacks are async
[13:30:04] <ezakimak> put the alert in the callback
[13:30:23] <aneki> i am not using an alert thats just an example
[13:30:38] <ezakimak> right. put the code to run upon completion in the callback. that's what the callback is for
[13:31:50] <aneki> pass it as an anonymous function?
[13:31:58] <ezakimak> if you want
[13:32:09] <ezakimak> or pass it the name of a named function
[13:32:43] <ezakimak> or call a named function from an anonymous function if you need to massage the parameters

[13:37:51] <alaing> Hi i'm trying to load content into a jquery UI tab. When I click on the tab that should do the ajax request Firebug complains that "junk after document element". Any ideas why this maybe happening
[13:38:16] <alaing> masentinel900: I've briefly looked at it
[13:38:40] <masentinel900> Ok
[13:38:57] <masentinel900> See, I'm working and show me the notification well
[13:39:09] <masentinel900> But I need that show me the close icon
[13:39:20] <masentinel900> And I don¬¥t get it
[13:42:14] <masentinel900> alaing: DO you have Idea what is happens?
[13:43:07] <alaing> masentinel900: are you using the jquery ui theme version?
[13:43:36] <masentinel900> mmm...
[13:43:45] <masentinel900> I don¬¥t believe it
[13:44:00] <snkcld> what is it called when you have an html text box that is able to autocomplete, or has automatic suggestions, based on some other data structure which contains possible results?
[13:44:07] <masentinel900> This ::  $.pnotify.defaults.styling = "jqueryui";?
[13:44:12] <alaing> masentinel900: you are using the bootstap version? :-D
[13:44:51] <masentinel900> How can I to know that?
[13:44:52] <alaing> working now?
[13:45:10] <masentinel900> yes
[13:46:18] <alaing> I think it default to bootstrap theme
[13:46:33] <alaing> and obviously you didn't have that theme
[13:46:51] <masentinel900> I just to put this :: styling: 'jqueryui',
[13:47:04] <masentinel900> And show me the close buttom
[13:47:16] <masentinel900> But is attached top right of the page
[13:48:21] <alaing> can someone help me with my jquery ui tab
[13:48:35] <alaing> masentinel900: you can set it as a default
[13:48:37] <alaing> $.pnotify.defaults.styling = "jqueryui";
[13:48:53] <masentinel900> What do you need
[13:49:46] <alaing> include this line somewhere before your first notice:
[13:50:10] <masentinel900> Yes, But what is your problem?
[13:50:27] <masentinel900> About jquery ui tab ?
[13:50:32] <masentinel900> Exactly what
[13:51:14] <alaing> 	Hi i'm trying to load content into a jquery UI tab. When I click on the tab that should do the ajax request Firebug complains that "junk after document element". Any ideas why this maybe happening
[13:51:42] <masentinel900> paste your script plz
[13:52:02] <alaing> the page that it calls just has html content but doesn't include the <body> etc
[13:52:25] <masentinel900> And your ajax script?
[13:52:30] <masentinel900> and jquery script?
[13:52:44] <masentinel900> how is your getting the content for to pass it?
[13:56:31] <alaing> jquery ui tabs does and ajax call if the href is pointing to another page
[14:00:25] <Andrew_R> alaing: yes, check the demo: http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#ajax
[14:00:27] <tdignan> alaing: the browser is reading the file in strict mode... i.e. it expects a valid xml file.
[14:01:18] <Andrew_R> (sorry I wasn't following along)
[14:03:30] <alaing> tdignan: the file just have a bunch on <p> and <h3> in it
[14:03:54] <tdignan> alaing: that is probably why.. can you find an example file of what the tabs expect you to load?
[14:04:50] <alaing> tdignan: i looked at the response the the jquery ui tab ajax demo returns and I based it on that
[14:05:00] <Andrew_R> alaing: is the href a relative path, or is it like "file:///path/to/file" ?
[14:05:02] <tdignan> yeah, I did just now as well
[14:05:05] <tdignan> so that seems fine
[14:05:34] <tdignan> alaing: i think your firebug error might be unrelated, maybe has to do with the whole page, and not the tab.
[14:06:11] <Quest> how to get the id of the first child of a parent? e.g how to get the #id value of the first <tr> in a <table> that has an id of #mytable?
[14:06:21] <alaing> Andrew_R: its relative
[14:07:17] <Andrew_R> in firebug, is do you show Content-Type: text/html in your response header?
[14:07:29] <alaing> Quest: $('#foo').children(':first-child').attr('id')
[14:07:55] <Quest> alaing, $('#foo').children(':first-child').attr('id').value?
[14:08:08] <alaing> Andrew_R: it doesn't show me the response header in firebug
[14:08:21] <alaing> Quest: no
[14:08:25] <Quest> k
[14:08:28] <Quest> thanks!
[14:08:50] <Andrew_R> if it's loading by ajax, you should see the requests in the conole tab
[14:09:30] <alaing> I know, but its throwing the error about "junk after document element"
[14:09:52] <alaing> but strangely doesn't show the GET request
[14:10:38] <alaing> I have "Show XMLHttpRequests" ticked in the console
[14:10:42] <alaing> of firebug
[14:11:47] <Andrew_R> that is strange, I wouldn't think you would get the "Junk after document" message until after the Ajax call
[14:12:04] <Andrew_R> it doesn't show a GET request on the Net tab either?
[14:12:27] <Andrew_R> do you have this on a publicly available URL?
[14:12:43] <TheSisb> This might be silly but is it possible to create a JS object that returns a number but has properties.  ie:  console.log(x) // 1   --  console.log(x.test()) // "test"
[14:13:00] <edelFr0st> I'd like to use accordion with bxslider. I have portfolio style div with three elements, when one is clicked I'd like the corresponding accordion to open and display the relevent info div. If it's neighbour is selected, bxslider will switch it. If a box below is clicked, then the accordion effect will happend for the new row. A terrible explination I know.

[14:30:35] <nixee> hello everyone jquery mobile newbie. I want "Our Top 5 Selling Products" as a title above form items: http://db.tt/deRyWcsi. How would I do that?
[14:32:44] <russellwwest> hi, probably a really newbie question. I have a menu in my website design (designed by someone else) that when you click on an item submenus expand (a bit like accordion). When I hover over a menu item, in the bottom left of the web browser it says "javascript:;"
[14:32:49] <russellwwest> what does that mean?
[14:33:42] <Andrew_R> javascript:; means basically, do nothing
[14:34:21] <Andrew_R> there must be a click event defined somewhere else, but in order for an "a" tag to act normally, it has to have an href.
[14:35:12] <nixee> I hope I'm making sense. I tried list-divider but this is a form so...
[14:35:26] <nixee> would not work
[14:36:14] <russellwwest> thanks Andrew_R makes sense.
[14:39:12] <Andrew_R> nixee: have you tried doing something like <div class="ui-bar"><h3>Our Top 5 Selling Products</h3></div> ?
[14:39:50] <Andrew_R> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/toolbars/docs-headers.html
[14:42:15] <nixee> Andrew_R: I will try.
[14:57:14] <nixee> Andrew_R: this is how "Our Top 5 Selling Products" got styled: http://db.tt/CEAgDi5D
[14:58:15] <nixee> Andrew_R: using the ui-bar div class. Can I use listview data role and wrap it on li tags?
[14:59:33] <Andrew_R> nixee: Sorry I don't know, it's been a while since I worked with jqm. I was looking at this page in the docs and it looks correct: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/toolbars/docs-headers.html
[14:59:55] <Andrew_R> I was missing the ui-bar-b class on the div, that may be important?
[15:00:37] <nixee> Andrew_R: I'll try I got it to work with listview. I'm a newbie in both jQuery and jQuery mobile so any help much appreciated. I'm taking a class in a community college
[15:01:05] <Andrew_R> cool
[15:01:25] <raj> Cork, still here?
[15:01:41] <MeXTuX> I have five checkboxes with the same class and the class is used as a selector to do something when some checkbox is clicked. But I don't get why the checkbox value is assigned to a variable this way var checked = $(this)[0].checked. What is "[0]" for?
[15:02:14] <Quest> var lastPostId = $('#mytable').children(':first-child').attr('id'); is showing undefined. how can i get the tag name instead of id?
[15:02:34] <nixee> Andrew_R: I guess I kinda feel like I wasted some time though because I would have much rather gone for a 4-year CS degree, but I wouldn't have learned any web design/dev otherwise..
[15:03:50] <Quest> alaing,?
[15:05:16] <Quest> i mean how can i be sure it exists. well it does. but dont know why its not getting it
[15:08:43] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/XseTu/
[15:08:49] <anew> anyone can help me with this cycle2 issue?
[15:08:54] <anew> cant get the images to cycle on hover
[15:12:13] <gordian> anew: you want them to cycle on hover only? what about pause?
[15:12:21] <anew> pause on leave
[15:14:59] <Quest> var lastPostId = $('#mytable').children(':first-child').attr('id'); is showing undefined. how can i get the tag name instead of id?  i mean how can i be sure it exists. well it does. but dont know why its not getting it
[15:21:14] <otters> has anybody had a problem with an indeterminate jquery-ui progressbar not showing the moving stripes?
[15:25:41] <gordian> anew: http://jsfiddle.net/XseTu/1/
[15:26:04] <anew> gordian i need to lazy load the images...
[15:26:11] <anew> with this way all the images get loaded on page load
[15:26:18] <anew> if i put them in a var on the bottom they get loaded on hover
[15:26:23] <gordian> well you can figure out the lazy load though, no?
[15:26:29] <gordian> that's just showing you the functionality
[15:26:32] <anew> no that's the problem that's giving me issues
[15:26:38] <anew> if i have 20 slideshows on one page
[15:26:43] <anew> how does it know which var to load?
[15:26:57] <anew> i mean i can write 20 different variables and 20 different .cycle()
[15:27:04] <otters> like, here
[15:27:04] <anew> but that doesnt seem very smart
[15:27:06] <otters> http://jsfiddle.net/YdVVL/
[15:27:12] <otters> how do I get the stripes on the jquery ui example?
[15:43:56] <gordian> anew: are all the slideshows supposed to trigger at once?
[15:44:04] <gordian> because using a class will do that
[15:44:05] <anew> no each one seperately
[15:44:13] <gordian> then you'll need to use IDs
[15:44:27] <anew> i have a class on the live site and they all trigger seperately on hove
[15:44:29] <anew> hover
[15:44:33] <anew> i dont htink that makes a difference
[15:44:45] <gordian> of course it does mate
[15:45:13] <gordian> if you have $('.slideshow').cycle() then every div with class slideshow will cycle when you hover over any one of them
[15:45:16] <anew> it works on the live site with all the same class name ..
[15:45:23] <anew> so that cant be correct
[15:45:24] <gordian> link?
[15:45:35] <anew> cant post in here
[15:45:37] <anew> trust me it works
[15:45:42] <anew> i had this working for cycle1
[15:45:45] <anew> just trying to get lazy load working
[15:45:51] <anew> with cycle 2
[15:45:58] <gordian> and i'm trying to help you
[15:46:02] <gordian> so shoot me the link
[15:46:12] <anew> the link is exacly what is in the fiddle
[15:46:23] <gordian> then why doesn't the fiddle work?
[15:46:28] <anew> the only thing different is the fiddle has cycle2 !!!
[15:46:39] <anew> cycle1 doesnt have lazyload
[15:46:46] <gordian> what's with the secrecy?
[15:46:51] <gordian> you can't share a link?
[15:46:59] <gordian> trying to help you
[15:47:22] <sunbeam> how can a $('.class:empty') be true
[15:47:27] <sunbeam> and still have html??
[15:48:15] <gordian> sunbeam: because :empty matches elements that have no children
[15:48:28] <sunbeam> how do you mean?
[15:48:33] <sunbeam> it has children
[15:48:42] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/XseTu/ gordian just look at my original fiddle to see that ur wrong
[15:48:57] <anew> when you hover over one, resume gets fired one time in the console
[15:49:03] <anew> if u were correct it would get fired twice
[15:49:16] <anew> so ur multiple class thing is incorrect
[15:50:16] <gordian> anew: it only fires once because it's firing on the same class
[15:50:42] <anew> gordian i have 20 slideshows on one page all with the same class nme and 4 lines of js
[15:50:45] <anew> ur not right man
[15:51:01] <gordian> yet you still refuse to share a working link
[15:51:32] <anew> jesus i'll copy/paste into fiddle
[15:51:42] <sunbeam> gordian: any idea?
[15:51:46] <anew> waste 5 minutes just to prove ur wrong instead of believing me
[15:51:48] <gordian> sunbeam: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:empty
[15:52:08] <sunbeam> ok very strange
[15:52:31] <gordian> sunbeam: a <p></p> is empty
[15:52:36] <gordian> but it has html
[15:52:54] <sunbeam> no this has a lot divs with classes
[15:53:03] <gordian> link?
[15:53:58] <sunbeam> offline
[15:53:59] <sunbeam> children().length > 0
[15:54:02] <sunbeam> ill use this better right
[15:54:08] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/BEPtH/
[15:54:09] <anew> gordian
[15:54:10] <anew> you see
[15:54:14] <anew> you're WRONG
[15:54:22] <anew> does anyone know jquery in here?
[15:54:41] <anew> woudl be helpful instead of gordian
[15:54:55] <sunbeam> nvm made a typo gordian sorry
[15:55:14] <gordian> anew: i was the only one trying to help
[15:55:19] <gordian> good luck
[15:55:23] <mike_papa> Hello. noob question: I have a set of buttons on page that toggle some div's visibility. Besides that it should change some img's scr, some text, etc. Now, what is correct way of passing those things to jQuery event? Those things are not static and cannot be hardcoded. They come from Django.
[15:55:27] <anew> well instead of taking my word that it worked
[15:55:34] <anew> you made me waste 10 minutes creating a fiddle
[15:55:38] <anew> pretty ridiculouos
[15:55:47] <anew> so do u have an explanation on why you were wrong?
[15:55:51] <anew> maybe u learned something here today
[15:56:07] <gordian> i don't owe your crappy attitude anything
[15:56:29] <gordian> i'm man enough to admit when i'm wrong but you don't deserve any more of my time
[15:56:34] <anew> i didnt say u owed me... but i just made you a better coder
[15:58:24] <gordian> anew: it seems your time might be better spent reading the examples on the cycle2 site since they tell you exactly what to do
[15:58:43] <anew> yes i can get it to work with one slideshow
[15:58:49] <anew> the problem is if you have 20 slideshows on one page
[15:58:58] <anew> you cant have one array named the same
[15:59:06] <anew> so somehow you have to split it up i dont know how
[15:59:25] <gordian> geezuz
[15:59:31] <gordian> good luck to ya
[15:59:36] <anew> why geezuz
[16:01:23] <sunbeam> i have a div that contains many (deeply inside) .button
[16:01:25] <sunbeam> i want to show only the last one
[16:01:26] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this?
[16:01:50] <gordian> anew: and you think *I* don't know jquery?
[16:02:14] <gordian> sunbeam: do you have a link?
[16:02:15] <anew> ok let's see u figure this out then genius i have a working example
[16:02:26] <anew> you're the one who just told me that the classes cant be the same name
[16:02:27] <gordian> without seeing it your best bet might be some clever CSS
[16:02:29] <anew> i mean wtf is that answer
[16:02:49] <gordian> your example is nothing like what you want to do
[16:02:55] <anew> wait
[16:03:01] <gordian> done waiting bra
[16:03:09] <anew> so then wtf are u talking for
[16:03:14] <anew> you give me the most basic ridiculous answer
[16:03:20] <anew> and now say ur a jquery god? lol
[16:03:27] <anew> u just told me i cant have the same class name s!!!
[16:03:45] <gordian> the nice thing about irc is that it's text based
[16:03:52] <gordian> you can scroll up and see that i said neither of those things
[16:04:00] <gordian> now go troll somewhere else!
[16:04:20] <anew> <gordian> anew: are all the slideshows supposed to trigger at once?
[16:04:20] <anew> <gordian> because using a class will do that
[16:04:20] <sunbeam> gordian: no but its very simple, say i have <div class="class"><a class="button">button</a><a class="button">button</a></div>
[16:04:25] <anew> <anew> i dont htink that makes a difference
[16:04:25] <anew> <gordian> of course it does mate
[16:04:29] <anew> case closed
[16:04:33] <sunbeam> I want to only have the last visible
[16:04:34] <anew> scroll up and see ur noobness
[16:04:38] <anew> just recognize u gave a wrong answer
[16:04:40] <anew> what is so hard about that
[16:05:29] <gordian> do you need to use jquery for that?
[16:05:38] <gordian> i'm only asking because this is #jquery
[16:05:45] <gordian> and it sounds like a question better suited for #css
[16:05:59] <anew> what are you even talking about
[16:06:16] <mike_papa> gordian: not if he needs it done dynamically
[16:06:40] <anew> $(.class).cycle()
[16:06:40] <anew> does not matter if i have 100 <div class="class"> in the page
[16:06:40] <anew> u wre wroong
[16:06:46] <gordian> that's why i asked
[16:07:06] <gordian> [7:05pm] gordian: do you need to use jquery for that?
[16:07:57] <anew> irc people who can never admit their wrong
[16:08:12] <Heyokah_> Hi y'all, I've got this simple jQuery command that's failing and I even have an online example of it you can see in Firebug.
[16:08:55] <mike_papa> anew: quit it. we all know you were right. It's enough.
[16:09:03] <jarray52> What does the syntax $(function() {  <stuff>  }); mean? Is this a closure adding to the scope of the Jquery $?
[16:09:06] <Heyokah_> $( "#loginDialog" ).dialog(); <-- You'd think that would open a jQuery dialog, eh?
[16:09:13] <anew> fine i'm done, he just keeps responding.  i have no idea what i'm doing anyway
[16:09:17] <tracker1> Heyokah_, do you have a jsfiddle of it or something?
[16:09:25] <Heyokah_> But alas, no good - for $().dialog is not a function, apparently. :P
[16:09:32] <tracker1> Isn't .dialog() a jQueryUI thing?
[16:09:43] <dcherman> anew: you just want the images lazy loaded, yes?
[16:09:59] <anew> dcherman i think i may have it, i'm using .each and a multidimensional array
[16:10:00] <tracker1> Heyokah_, pretty sure you'll need to build/add jQueryUI to your project (or find a lighter weight dialog)
[16:10:15] <anew> theh problem is i have 20 slideshows on one page, so i have to create a multiarray and loop thru it somewho
[16:10:15] <anew> think i almost have it
[16:10:18] <dcherman> anew: this might be easier: http://jsfiddle.net/BEPtH/1/
[16:10:23] <Heyokah_> tracker1: Ah you're right, how boneheaded of me. thanks
[16:10:40] <anew> yeah dcherman that doesnt work because you are loading everything on page load
[16:10:44] <tracker1> Heyokah_, np
[16:11:04] <anew> thx tho
[16:11:05] <dcherman> anew: nope, i'm not.  only the first image in each cycle so it doesn't show up as a blank img
[16:11:09] <anew> oh
[16:11:13] <anew> wait let me check network
[16:12:03] <anew> how the heck are you doing that without using his progressive parameter
[16:12:50] <anew> something is weird with the second set of images tho let me see
[16:13:07] <gordian> anew actually just misinterpreted what i said actually
[16:13:16] <gordian> and his example had nothing to do with what i said
[16:13:26] <gordian> similar, but not the same
[16:13:27] <anew> are u still talking about this
[16:13:30] <dcherman> anew: pretty much if no src attribute exists, no request will be made.  before each image is shown, i'm just shoving "data-src" into "src" if it's falsy
[16:13:45] <gordian> blah blah
[16:13:45] <anew> very tricky
[16:14:40] <jarray52> What does the syntax '$(function() {  <stuff>  });' mean?
[16:15:00] <tracker1> passing $ a function runs that function on document/dom ready
[16:15:06] <anew> that's crazy dhcerman
[16:15:15] <tracker1> which happens before rendering completes (window/load)
[16:15:16] <anew> i wont have to do this insane array setup i just did
[16:15:27] <anew> one question tho, why on first hover the images load very strangely
[16:15:59] <dcherman> strangely how?  only tested thing in chrome since i'm busy w/ other things atm
[16:16:08] <anew> that's insane, what a tricky way to do this
[16:16:24] <anew> i dunno when u first hover they load a blank image for like 500ms then the actual image
[16:16:26] <jarray52> tracker1: So, it's appended to the current document ready at the time that piece of code is encountered? Or, is it appended at the beginning or end?
[16:16:29] <anew> then every image after that loads ok
[16:16:32] <tracker1> jarray52, there are two primary load events for a page... dom-ready, and window-load... when you pass the function into $(...) it binds that to the dom-ready event (which runs when the wireframe/dom of the page is done)
[16:16:34] <anew> let me test on the live site both ways written
[16:16:45] <tracker1> jarray52, it's after whatever was bound to that event before it.
[16:17:08] <jarray52> tracker1: Thanks
[16:17:40] <anew> i *think the problem with your method is i wont be able to use any of the cycle2 parameters
[16:17:46] <anew> that's why they are loading oddly
[16:18:01] <anew> they are loading just like loading a normal image on the page instead of the slideshow he uses
[16:18:15] <anew> but +10 points for a cool way to do it
[16:19:52] <dcherman> anew: if you can make a fiddle with how you want it to look, i can try before heading out in a few mins - the original fiddle that you linked loads the same way ( at least for me on chrome )
[16:20:08] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/nDVL4/
[16:20:08] <dcherman> never used this plugin, so i dont know how this is supposed to look.
[16:20:12] <anew> here is my way
[16:20:17] <anew> not sure if it is the 'best' way
[16:20:20] <anew> i'm trying to est it now
[16:20:21] <anew> bt it works
[16:21:01] <anew> i get strange image loads with my way also
[16:21:10] <anew> so i dont know maybe there is no other way with lazy load
[16:21:18] <anew> does lazy load not load smoothly ?
[16:22:22] <dcherman> even in your original fiddle its not really smoothly, but yea you need to be smart about lazy loading so it looks nice.
[16:22:48] <dcherman> instead of looking the immediate next slide, maybe load the one after that - that way the image is being fetched during your timeout.
[16:22:57] <anew> yeah u see what i'm talking about
[16:23:00] <anew> it's not smooth
[16:23:10] <anew> hmmm
[16:23:30] <anew> how can with ur example which i like better lol... load it the way u jsut described ?
[16:23:47] <anew> it sounds like.. the holy grail
[16:24:25] <anew> i have an idea... maybe change all data-src to src on hover?
[16:24:31] <anew> so all 3 images are loaded on hover
[16:24:41] <anew> so the first one is probably going to tcome fucked up but the next 2 smooth ?
[16:27:40] <dcherman> anew: gonna have to mess around with it since i gotta run, good luck, but at least you've got a starting point.
[16:29:43] <anew> yep thanks a lot man
[16:47:01] <mike_papa> that should be simple one: http://jsfiddle.net/wWgnV/ - what I need is to get all those things I change (html and attributes) somewhere from html (that will be provided by Django dynamically). What is correct way of doing that?
[16:51:43] <Assimilater> can I have some help debugging something? I have working code here http://dot.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=search.php such that when you click on one of the lowest level tree items on the left it pops a div on the right. Now i've migrated that code to a different page and wrapped it in a dialog accessible at the top middle button "Modify Filters". When clicking on the li now it causes the script to crash. Any ideas why?
[16:52:13] <Assimilater> sorry, the new page: http://dot.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php
[16:52:15] <Andrew_R> mike_papa: I don't understand your question
[16:54:44] <mike_papa> Andrew_R: let's say that this is included couple of times in the page. And each time I need different src, alt and html value. How I can think of it is to assign somehow those values to .some_parent and get them as attributes for .click event. But I don't know even where to start.
[16:55:48] <Andrew_R> mike_papa: gotcha, give me a few minutes I'll update your fiddle
[16:56:02] <mike_papa> Andrew_R: thanks :)
[16:59:37] <Assimilater> where are my gurus? djQuery there? or who else do I know? :P
[17:00:12] <Assimilater> haven't heard from ajpiano since I got back from volunteer work
[17:00:27] <Assimilater> in any case, anyone ideas on ^?
[17:01:27] <Andrew_R> mike_papa: http://jsfiddle.net/wWgnV/1/
[17:01:50] <Andrew_R> it gets a little verbose having 6 data- attributes on the container div, but it works
[17:01:54] <Assimilater> oh wait, nvm I think i figuerd it out
[17:02:15] <Assimilater> infinite loop....i added an extra parent causing the loop to skip over my exit condition....
[17:02:18] <Assimilater> 'doh!
[17:02:19] <mike_papa> Andrew_R: Thanks a lot. That was what I meant.
[17:02:48] <Andrew_R> Assimilater: I'm getting a "A script on this page may be busy" message in Firefox... stuck in a loop?
[17:03:20] <Andrew_R> Assimilater: haha :)
[17:03:24] <Assimilater> Andrew_R: indeed, lol, thanks :)
[17:03:32] <mike_papa> Andrew_R: I bet I could find solution on many tutorials, but sometimes it's so hard to ask google right question when you're not really fluent with subject. :)
[17:04:16] <shoky> Assimilater: because you have an endless loop, going to the grandparent each time
[17:04:33] <shoky> while #searchFrom is the great grandparent
[17:04:43] <Andrew_R> mike_papa: the data-* attributes are a good place to store data you need later
[17:04:44] <shoky> use .closest() instead..
[17:05:26] <Assimilater> shoky: that would probably be more bug proof, wouldn't it? hehe
[17:05:36] <mike_papa> Andrew_R: Lesson learned. You saved my day. Thanks again.
[17:05:43] <Assimilater> shoky: one of those methods I'm not practiced at :P
[17:05:53] <Assimilater> so therefore don't think to use
[17:05:54] <Assimilater> hehe
[17:06:11] <shoky> if you make a loop, make sure it ends ;p
[17:06:23] <shoky> you should be practiced in that most importantly ;p
[17:06:26] <Assimilater> i mean the closest() method :P
[17:06:41] <shoky> aye
[17:08:13] <Andrew_R> Can you pass multiple selectors to .closest()? ex: $(this).closest('.class1, .class2')
[17:08:25] <shoky> that's one selector
[17:08:38] <Andrew_R> yeah I guess it is
[17:09:35] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/nDVL4/ http://jsfiddle.net/6hku6/ notice the first link how the images load, and then in the second link how they load
[17:09:45] <anew> how can i get two slideshows to load smoothly like the second link
[17:14:49] <Assimilater> shoky: remind me on closest; $('#myli').closest('li') appears to return the very same li?
[17:16:13] <shoky> Assimilater: yeah it also includes the current element, you should probably use a class. ill check yourpage again, sec
[17:16:30] <shoky> (or an id)
[17:16:35] <Assimilater> it has potentially limitless levels to navigate through, classing which would be a pain
[17:16:51] <Assimilater> i think i'll go back to parent :P
[17:18:37] <shoky> Assimilater: sorry didnt realize you were building that string in the loop,
[17:18:54] <Assimilater> shoky: np, good suggestion ntl
[17:19:13] <shoky> Assimilater: maybe use .parentsUntil()
[17:19:37] <Assimilater> shoky: which will return an empty set if the selector is not found?
[17:19:50] <shoky> think so
[17:19:54] <shoky> ?parentsUntil
[17:19:55] <bot-t> .parentsUntil([selector], [filter]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/parentsUntil/
[17:20:19] <Assimilater> shoky: according to docs appears this would grab all parents in between
[17:20:29] <shoky> right
[17:20:43] <Assimilater> shoky: what I got works for me. thanks though :)
[17:20:47] <shoky> and you can loop it
[17:21:06] <Assimilater> shoky: i'd just as soon not filter out those in betweens :)
[17:21:39] <shoky> ok, enjoy figuring it out again next time you (or someone) adds an element in between ;p
[17:22:09] <Assimilater> shoky: haha, thanks, though i don't forsee that happening

[18:10:58] <tpayne> Hello. I'd like to fade something out, and as soon as it's done, fade something in. Does fade out have a callback? If so, what's the syntax
[18:11:27] <Gazpacho> yes it does, see the docs
[18:12:19] <tpayne> Gazpacho: can you point an old buccaneer in the right direction?
[18:12:33] <Gazpacho> i just did
[18:12:35] <Foxhoundz> tpayne: chain it
[18:13:08] <tpayne> $('el1').fadeOut().$('el2').fadeIn()
[18:15:07] <tpayne> oh i see. thanks
[18:15:07] <Foxhoundz> no sorry
[18:25:58] <gordian> tpayne: http://jsfiddle.net/FMuuc/
[18:42:09] <tpayne> is jQuery smart enough to use css animations for fadeIn/out, or is this something i have to tell it to use?
[18:42:21] <tpayne> i guess that makes no sense.
[18:44:13] <BillCriswell> tpayne: It's ok.

[19:10:14] <scar> what is the best way to prevent a hover chaos when the mouse is over and out faster than say a fade in within that hover?
[19:12:06] <scar> i used stop but it prevents on hover
[19:12:42] <vernonk> https://github.com/briancherne/jquery-hoverIntent
[19:13:05] <vernonk> Great little plugin that tries to determine intent on hover.
[19:13:13] <innociv_> I am creating and object and pushing it into an array.  How can I tell what index the object is within the array? IE.  function myObj(){ this.index = ??? } var objs = [new myObj(), new myObj()];  objs[0].index needs to return 0;
[19:15:37] <sacho_> the execution of the constructor happens before the array's instantiation
[19:15:44] <scar> vernonk, yeah i was using hoverIntent but had some issues with it. im just curious why say $(item).stop().fadeIn(); and $(item).stop().fadeOut() doesnt work. when i do it too quick, the new mouse over wont trigger
[19:16:05] <coldhead> ?stop @ scar
[19:16:06] <bot-t> scar, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[19:16:12] <scar> i want it to hover immediately, just if i move my mouse rapidly, it seems to queue the next
[19:16:29] <scar> coldhead, jas let me fiddle
[19:16:42] <innociv_> sacho_, well how can I have a myObj.prototype.getIndex() function be aware of the index the object is in the array?
[19:17:18] <innociv_> Can I compare object references to see if they match?
[19:17:27] <innociv_> lets see..
[19:20:01] <scar> coldhead, http://jsfiddle.net/U7Zb9/ -- move your mouse quickly over and out over and out and itll stop fading in
[19:20:23] <scar> oops sorry about the jumping
[19:20:24] <scar> lol
[19:20:40] <scar> http://jsfiddle.net/U7Zb9/
[19:20:43] <scar> http://jsfiddle.net/U7Zb9/1/
[19:21:49] <innociv_> Yes it seems I can.
[19:22:10] <coldhead> scar: http://jsfiddle.net/U7Zb9/2/
[19:22:24] <innociv_> http://jsbin.com/efugej/1/edit this looks fine, right?
[19:22:30] <scar> hm
[19:22:38] <scar> interesting
[19:23:18] <coldhead> that looks terrible, innociv_
[19:23:26] <innociv_> :(
[19:23:30] <innociv_> Why?
[19:23:34] <scar> coldhead, any reason .closest() wont work? http://jsfiddle.net/U7Zb9/3/ what is best way? i can use children but im not sure what the proper way is
[19:23:36] <coldhead> my first reacion is WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
[19:23:43] <innociv_> Baring that.
[19:23:51] <innociv_> I do need to know the index from inside the object
[19:23:52] <coldhead> if you want indexes, then use arrays
[19:23:58] <innociv_>  I am using arrays of objects
[19:24:05] <coldhead> then the next complaint is that you're searching the entire array for the index
[19:24:10] <innociv_> I need the index of the object in the array
[19:24:16] <coldhead> when you could cache it in the individual object as you add them
[19:24:23] <innociv_> It's my understanding that iterating an array is pretty fast.
[19:24:33] <innociv_> coldhead, issue there is ones being added/removed
[19:24:35] <innociv_> Their index can change
[19:24:42] <coldhead> slitting a child's throat can be pretty fast
[19:24:47] <innociv_> lol
[19:24:47] <coldhead> doesn't mean you should
[19:25:05] <innociv_> I could set it static and then adjust every object when the array is adjusted
[19:25:17] <innociv_> Way more code and then every object is adjusted on each array change.
[19:25:29] <coldhead> scar: http://jsfiddle.net/U7Zb9/4/
[19:25:36] <coldhead> closest is for parents, find is for children
[19:25:53] <coldhead> i don't understand the use fully, innociv_, maybe this is the best way
[19:25:54] <scar> ahh
[19:25:56] <scar> :D
[19:26:01] <coldhead> but to me it looks like you're reinventing a wheel
[19:26:10] <coldhead> and inviting a lot of bugs
[19:26:51] <coldhead> maybe you should just slit the child's throat, i'm not here to judgeg
[19:26:55] <innociv_> lol
[19:27:21] <innociv_> I feel I need this because it really cleans up code not having to pass the whole array all over when I can fetch the index from the object.
[19:29:08] <innociv_> Meh i'll set it on creation and not let it change actually.
[19:40:30] <innociv_> How do I select the element above the current selector?  I would think before() acts as a getter, but nope.
[19:41:08] <shoky> above? parent()? prev()?
[19:41:46] <innociv_> ah prev()
[19:42:20] <coldhead> ladies and gentlemen
[19:42:25] <coldhead> we are floating in space

[19:52:11] <yogurt_truck> sure. watch it. it's not as bad as some (including myself D:) have said it is. i recently watched it again and realized that my initial "complaints" were silly. it's not as plothole-ish as I remembered it
[19:52:40] <yogurt_truck> er... wrong channel.

[20:06:00] <bsdbofh> Hey all, I'm using Jquery to create a Right Click Context Menu. Then when an Item is selected in that menu, I'm creating a Dialog Box with an HTML Form. I'm then trying to use JQuery to, on button click, submit the contents of that form, along with the DIV ID of the original element that was Right Clicked on. However, I'm not getting any of it. http://jsfiddle.net/PQUpB/
[20:06:12] <bsdbofh> Any ideas?
[20:06:57] <bsdbofh> Lines 66, 67, and 68 is where I'm trying to POST the data with the values
[20:15:58] <bsdbofh> Updated, with more of the actual page data that I'm working on, http://jsfiddle.net/PQUpB/6/

[21:04:32] <raj> Cork, ping
[21:04:33] <raj> :)
[21:04:45] <raj> probably 5am where he is
[21:04:52] <raj> k, I'll hold off a few hours
[21:06:41] <thomedy> i came up witha  solution that works better than i expected
[21:07:04] <raj> what's that thomedy
[21:07:28] <thomedy> i have an iframe tha tim trying to manipulate the content for an lighbox
[21:07:44] <thomedy> well i set  a flag to false and if the iframe load s then it becomes true
[21:07:47] <raj> how so?
[21:07:54] <raj> ok
[21:08:08] <thomedy> which means that the new window is false and the original window is altered
[21:08:21] <raj> ok
[21:08:28] <thomedy> so the new window is preventdefault and the old window is wide open
[21:08:50] <thomedy> i am new to iframe stuff cuz its so looked down on
[21:08:58] <thomedy> bit ot totaly makes sense
[21:09:48] <Gazpacho> ishame
[21:11:55] <raj> thomedy, nicely done
[21:12:09] <raj> i'm trying to tackle an iframe issue myself, so intersted to hear your story :)
[21:12:19] <thomedy> well i usually do raw js...
[21:12:37] <thomedy> but im doing jquery now cuz im tring to go for real jobs and need to show tha ti can do this too

[23:55:15] <Alecoalec> If there is serveral #all_product on a page, is there any way to call the first or second one
[23:55:54] <coldhead> IDs must be unique, Alecoalec
[23:56:02] <coldhead> you can't have more than one on a page
[23:56:06] <coldhead> it will break things
[23:56:30] <Alecoalec> It's a class my bad on the #
[23:56:35] <coldhead> if you have a class you can select $('#all_product:eq(1)')
[23:56:38] <coldhead> ?:eq
