[00:05:28] <MoTiOnXml> is jQuery delegate() the equivalent of jQuery.live(, local-element)?
[00:05:41] <MoTiOnXml> i.e. a shortcut for making a live delegate with a local context?
[00:05:41] <JKarsrud> ?source delegate
[00:05:43] <bot-t> Line#3062 - "delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) { return this.live( types, data, fn, selector ); }" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#3062
[00:07:32] <MoTiOnXml> JKarsrud: thought so
[00:16:06] <Guest13362> why would jquery() work but not $() ?
[00:16:37] <Cork> cause something else grabs $
[00:16:58] <Cork> like another framework or the debug console of your testing there
[00:17:49] <Guest13362> okay. thanks. I'm chopping up this code and it's in WP so I'm probably loading too much
[00:18:59] <JKarsrud> Yah, WP can fuck that shit up
[00:19:34] <JKarsrud> easy fix is using an IIFE where you pass in jQuery; (function($) { // your code here }(jQuery));
[00:23:39] <Guest13362> I'm only seeing jquery superfish/supersubs and something called l10n.js
[00:24:53] <JKarsrud> well, they've probably overriden something in there, and if you load that, it might not work.
[00:25:22] <JKarsrud> but that small snippet I showed you makes sure you're using jQuery as $, not something else that can be jquery or some other framework
[00:25:25] <Guest13362> yeah i'm about to unpack this l10n.js it's tiny
[00:26:20] <JKarsrud> it's just something for localization (l10n)
[00:27:12] <Guest13362> JKarsrud: at thanksI was about to say that.
[00:27:18] <Guest13362> well ask what ti is
[00:27:43] <JKarsrud> l10n is just short for localization
[00:28:04] <JKarsrud> as a11y is for accessibility and i18n is for internationalization
[00:28:06] <JKarsrud> :P

[00:53:20] <nauthiz> ok, found it, rowspan only works within the same tbody.... what aaa crap
[00:59:25] <michs> i tried $('.a + .b').each(function(){

[01:17:36] <stuartrexking> Using jquery 1.6 I am trying to add a custom header using the headers map, as specified in the docs here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

[01:19:34] <stuartrexking> According to the docs, headers is a map.
[01:20:09] <skript> so call it headers instead of aheaders

[01:20:32] <albacker> im using .live() and i have a case that i have never met before. There's a span inside a span (ex. <span id="one"><span id="2" onclick="foo()"> asd </span> </span>), when i'm doing $('#one').show();, which is done just after clicking on another link in the page (a third one) the foo() function is executed (like a click is being made on that span or something). What might cause this?
[01:25:52] <albacker> did i explain my case right, if someone can help me or hint me i'd appreciate it.
[01:26:22] <plov> wondering if im doing something wrong, trying to $('#a_div').serialize() but get nothing? inside #a_div is input tags
[01:27:46] <mipo> hi
[01:27:52] <markj> plov serialize is meant to be called on a form tag or a jquery object of inputs/textareas/selects
[01:28:01] <mipo> how to set fade effect to append?
[01:28:05] <markj> ?serialize @ plov
[01:28:07] <bot-t> plov, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[01:28:10] <markj> read the first line..
[01:28:20] <plov> markj: ah ok
[01:28:30] <plov> with scriptaculous i could call serialize on divs :o
[01:28:35] <plov> anything like that with jquery?
[01:28:49] <blackspotwiggins> select a form and/or inputs?
[01:29:01] <blackspotwiggins> $("#a_div :input").serialize()
[01:29:23] <blackspotwiggins> magic..
[01:29:31] <albacker> anybody has a hint on my case? or a link for me to read?
[01:29:42] <krz> at http://www.last.fm/events click on "Jump to another location" what effect is that?
[01:29:47] <krz> its definitely not slideDown
[01:29:58] <krz> effect/animation
[01:30:11] <markj> albacker the hint is to not use onclick events, if you can't change that then go kill whoever made you work on that code :]
[01:30:23] <r3v3rb> okay can someone help with a little jScrollPane/CSS issue at all?
[01:30:55] <blackspotwiggins> krz, i would guess the height is animated
[01:31:00] <stuartrexking> markj: Using jquery 1.6 I am trying to add a custom header using the headers map, as specified in the docs here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[01:31:05] <blackspotwiggins> which is what slidedown does as well iirc
[01:31:08] <albacker> markj, how am i able to do ajax calls etc. if i dont use onclick events?
[01:31:08] <stuartrexking> http://pastebin.com/es7fZFke
[01:31:20] <stuartrexking> Any ideas?
[01:31:31] <markj> i simply mean inline like that
[01:31:34] <markj> ?click @ albacker
[01:31:34] <bot-t> albacker, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[01:31:37] <krz> blackspotwiggins: how would i do such a thing with jquery?
[01:31:59] <blackspotwiggins> krz, animate() the height?
[01:32:01] <AdvoWork> in my location ive got .....index.php?something=test&job=12345&cust=5678  is there a way i can do: <a href="something&" THEN get the jobnumber from the location?
[01:32:22] <albacker> markj, well .click() wont work on new added elements with ajax. that's why im using live. and that's not working
[01:33:06] <r3v3rb> i have this as a new test page that uses ajax to retrieve a page based on the users choice, but it doesn't get the right height for the scrollpane so a user can only scroll so far
[01:33:10] <r3v3rb> http://victoriastone.co.uk/test/areas.html
[01:33:15] <markj> i appreciate that but you still have a piece of code that says onclick="" so my point stands?
[01:33:26] <r3v3rb> if anyone can help its greatly appreciated
[01:33:29] <markj> and if live isnt working you're using it wrong
[01:33:50] <Patatouf> hi all ! I would like to do an ul li list where every li has a different value like '2011-06-28_10:30" but when I am using $(this).attr('value'), it returns only 2011. Any idea ? Thx for your help !
[01:36:28] <albacker> markj, your point stands, but i just tried removing the onclick on the element and the bug is there.
[01:36:29] <Patatouf> nb: i am not talking about the value between both <li></li> but the value like <li value="">qsdqsd</li>
[01:37:41] <markj> Patatouf li's dont have a value attribute, use data attributes
[01:38:18] <Patatouf> oh something like <li data="mydata">dsfsd</li> and the i do $(this).attr('data') ?
[01:39:08] <Cork> Patatouf: no prefix your attribute with data-
[01:39:14] <Cork> then you can use .data() to grab it
[01:39:47] <Cork>  <li data-info="mydata">dsfsd</li> $(this).data('info')
[01:39:59] <Patatouf> Cork, ok thx ! I try that :)
[01:40:14] <Patatouf> I didnt know that
[01:40:34] <Cork> html5 standards
[01:40:36] <krz> blackspotwiggins: no its not animate height
[01:40:39] <krz> its something else
[01:40:43] <krz> it still looks different
[01:41:03] <Patatouf> Cork & markj : perfect ! thx for ur help !
[01:41:17] <blackspotwiggins> krz, thats what it looks visually
[01:41:24] <blackspotwiggins> maybe it's something else really
[01:41:31] <krz> yea something else
[01:42:22] <blackspotwiggins> IMO the visual effect is more important than what it does behind the scenes
[01:44:46] <krz> blackspotwiggins: actually i think its that
[01:44:47] <krz> thanks
[01:48:48] <r3v3rb> any one, no ideas on the ajax into jScrollPane not having enough scrollable space?
[01:53:48] <krz> blackspotwiggins: actually its not. since the text moves down as well
[01:53:52] <krz> in last.fm
[01:54:09] <krz> height only affects the container
[01:54:59] <stuartrexking> Is it possible to add a custom header with .ajax() of dataType jsonp?
[01:55:34] <r3v3rb> i hate jScrollPane its official
[01:56:05] <r3v3rb> i've tried everything to get the entire contents to show but its still stops short
[01:56:41] <soc42> hi #jquery
[01:57:33] <plov> im using a sortable+draggable, having trouble understanding how to use this in conjunction with .ajax/.serialize, i'm trying to get the new position of how a user sorts
[01:57:43] <soc42> are there any best practice examples on how and where to put jquery in <html>-documents?
[01:57:47] <Woet> r3v3rb: still working on jScrollPane? :)
[01:57:57] <plov> so i have everything working, except, it's not sending the data in the new 'order' its being sorted
[01:58:26] <plov> always sending data in the order it was rendered
[01:58:28] <r3v3rb> can someone take a look at http://www.victoriastone.co.uk/test/areas.html and tell me why it doesn't always show the entire jscrollpane's contents when clicking on the links (which are loaded by ajax)
[02:02:08] <mipo> how to change background color with effect?
[02:02:32] <Aamir> mipo: u cant but with a plugin
[02:02:59] <JKarsrud> jQuery ui has color animation, but I think sean` wrote a plugin that does it too?
[02:03:05] <timing> when I do $.get({dataType: 'json'}), should it check if the data is actual json?
[02:03:08] <mipo> I have a plugin
[02:03:09] <JKarsrud> If I remember correctly
[02:03:11] <sean`> no
[02:03:15] <Aamir> ?g jquery color plugin
[02:03:18] <bot-t> Aamir, Color Animations | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[02:03:18] <sean`> I made a CSS hook which animates background alpha
[02:03:24] <JKarsrud> sean`: oright
[02:03:28] <mipo> but that have browser errro
[02:03:30] <mipo> error
[02:03:54] <mipo> sean` : can you send me a link
[02:03:55] <mipo> ?
[02:04:48] <lucasw> this is really homemade script, but what have i made wrong http://pastie.org/2133196 here? i think u understand what i want to achieve.
[02:04:49] * r3v3rb cries
[02:04:58] <sean`> mipo http://jsfiddle.net/seankoole/BdNPr/
[02:04:58] <krz> at http://www.last.fm/events click on "Jump to another location" what slide effect is that? anyone?
[02:05:16] <r3v3rb> is jScrollPane really bad or is it me?
[02:05:58] <JKarsrud> wtf is jscrollpane
[02:05:59] <JKarsrud> ?
[02:06:06] <mipo> sean` , oh! you are advance
[02:06:11] <mipo> but I am new!
[02:06:22] <sean`> JKarsrud, it's good
[02:06:24] <sean`> mipo, I'm not
[02:06:29] <mipo> :D
[02:06:35] <sean`> I ahve written my first jqueries only yesterday
[02:06:45] <mipo> ready?
[02:06:47] <sean`> Yes
[02:06:49] <sean`> I have good teachers
[02:06:53] <Samian> HOLLLY CRAP!!! there is 855 people in here!!!!!!!
[02:06:56] <r3v3rb> muhahaha, i think i fixed it JKarsrud
[02:07:02] <mipo> I think so!
[02:07:05] <Samian> this channel has more people in it than any other programming channel!
[02:07:07] <JKarsrud> r3v3rb: good
[02:07:11] <Samian> and jquery isnt even programming
[02:07:16] <sean`> Samian, long live the hype
[02:07:27] <Samian> the hype?
[02:07:30] <blackspotwiggins> Samian, clearly jQuery is chess
[02:07:34] <blackspotwiggins> not programming
[02:07:39] <r3v3rb> img from google didn't have height specified so maybe jScrollPane fired before the image appeared and therefore threw the containing height out..
[02:07:41] <sean`> Samian, didn't you know, jquery is just a hype?
[02:07:45] <Samian> is jquery easier than c ?
[02:07:55] <JKarsrud> no.
[02:07:57] <sean`> It will never last! It's too good to be true!
[02:07:59] <JKarsrud> jQuery is effin' hard!
[02:08:08] <sean`> ?muu @ JKarsrud
[02:08:08] <Samian> why isn't jQuery taught in schools like how c and java is
[02:08:09] <bot-t> JKarsrud, much unlike urself
[02:08:11] <JKarsrud> what is all this $ and {} ?
[02:08:20] <blackspotwiggins> sean`, oh snap
[02:08:25] <JKarsrud> sean`: NO U
[02:08:26] <sean`> ?osb
[02:08:26] <JKarsrud> :(
[02:08:28] <bot-t> oh snaoâ„¢ bitch
[02:08:32] <Samian> sean` I'm the dude that had the abusive boss about a year ago
[02:08:36] <Samian> remember?
[02:08:40] <r3v3rb> bot-t is alive again...
[02:08:42] <sean`> Yeah, Samian
[02:08:44] <Samian> and everyone was telling me to quit
[02:08:48] <Samian> well I did
[02:08:49] <JKarsrud> did you?
[02:08:53] <sean`> Samian++
[02:08:53] <JKarsrud> good for you!
[02:09:00] <Samian> yep
[02:09:07] <ryangreene> I need help giving focus to a section of a page on load.
[02:09:07] <Samian> I'm doing research at my uni now
[02:09:11] <JKarsrud> r3v3rb: but nice, that might be it :)
[02:09:21] <JKarsrud> ryangreene: like highlight it?
[02:09:31] <r3v3rb> i think it is because every link now produces the correct height
[02:09:44] <ryangreene> JKarsrud: no not an input feild
[02:09:45] <timing> hmm, this says 1.4. I have 1.5, what is different?
[02:09:47] <timing> "json": Evaluates the response as JSON and returns a JavaScript object. In jQuery 1.4 the JSON data is parsed in a strict manner; any malformed JSON is rejected and a parse error is thrown. (See json.org for more information on proper JSON formatting.)
[02:09:54] <JKarsrud> ryangreene: exactly my point ;)
[02:10:00] <Samian> I didn't realize how much that job sucked until I started working elsewhere
[02:10:09] <Samian> I thought it was me and not the job. but I was wrong
[02:10:09] <ryangreene> When the page loads you cannot scroll with the keys
[02:11:20] <ryangreene> JKarsrud: I made a simple post here today, maybe you can shed some more light on it for me
[02:11:25] <ryangreene> http://goo.gl/YnyTD
[02:14:24] <JKarsrud> ryangreene: are you sure focus applies to other elements than form elements?
[02:14:30] <JKarsrud> like input, button etc?
[02:14:50] <ryangreene> JKarsrud: No, I don't know
[02:15:13] <ryangreene> all I know is that you cannot scroll with the keys on page load
[02:15:40] <sean`> Samian, I recently quit too
[02:15:58] <ryangreene> a guy I work with mentioned that in order to fix it you say simple need to give focus to the body or #realBody
[02:16:13] <ryangreene> *may not say
[02:16:34] <JKarsrud> uhm, I don't understand how that should help you?
[02:17:17] <JKarsrud> how would putting focus to an element help you scroll with keys before the page is loaded?
[02:18:03] <ryangreene> giving focus to the body wouldn't enable scrolling with the keys after the page loads?
[02:18:32] <JKarsrud> after the page is loaded you can scroll with the keys all you want? default browser behaviour
[02:18:34] <ryangreene> On a broader spectrum what would you do / How would you troubleshoot this problem?
[02:19:04] <ryangreene> You cannot scroll with the keys unless you click somewhere on the page
[02:19:14] <JKarsrud> ah, like that
[02:19:22] <JKarsrud> well, you could just trigger a click on body?
[02:19:32] <Lorisse> Hi, do you know which jquery plugin was used here to create the "jump location" dropdown effect? www.last.fm/events
[02:19:54] <JKarsrud> ryangreene: on document ready, then $('body').click()?
[02:19:57] <ryangreene> I could do that I suppose , Is that the cleanest way you think?
[02:20:48] <JKarsrud> may not work tho, seeing as the reason you can't scroll is because the focus is on the address bar in the browser?
[02:21:01] <JKarsrud> trigging a click wouldn't steal the focus, I think
[02:21:21] <JKarsrud> you could make an input-field that you hide, and put focus on that?
[02:21:22] <ryangreene> um, I'm not sure where the focus is. How can I tell? with firebug?
[02:21:23] <JKarsrud> :)
[02:21:39] <PrinceES> i am trying to find a way to make it something for watching the video on my jquery jcarousel slider
[02:21:48] <JKarsrud> kinda hard to debug something outside the document with firebug
[02:22:34] <ryangreene> Okay, so giving specific focus to the body wouldn't be simple?
[02:22:41] <Samian> l can't wait until technology advances to the point where we can have like sex bots
[02:23:41] <ryangreene> JKarsrud: and also enable scrolling after the page loads?
[02:24:06] <Putr> is it just me or does selecting by name not work in jquery... ? $("name*='copyPastedName'") does not select anything :(
[02:26:06] <JKarsrud> ryangreene: you can't put focus on body
[02:26:23] <JKarsrud> you could put focus to a hidden form element tho
[02:26:26] <ryangreene> JKarsrud: or any other defined region?
[02:26:39] <JKarsrud> sure, you can try it
[02:26:46] <ryangreene> like #realBody ?
[02:27:01] <ryangreene> okay I'd love to try it
[02:27:29] <ryangreene> see the link from earlier? to stackOverflow?
[02:27:44] <plov> why is, var position = $('#sortable').sortable("serialize"); returning a object?
[02:27:50] <plov> doc says it returns a hash?
[02:28:27] <Lorisse> Hi, do you know which jquery plugin was used here to create the "jump location" dropdown effect? http://www.last.fm/events
[02:29:40] <JKarsrud> with something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/DRDRc/
[02:29:50] <JKarsrud> ryangreene: check that
[02:30:07] <JKarsrud> except you'd need to steal its focus agin unless you want to scroll inside that box all the time
[02:31:06] <ryangreene> JKarsrud: well it is almost the entire body so it is fine that it will have focus
[02:34:34] <njckname> I'm having trouble getting the jquery UI dialog to open an iframe with a large enough width and height. Here: http://pastehtml.com/view/aymwtlrhr.html you can see how it behaves when setting the width to "auto" and when the width is set to "900px". How can I get the dialog and iframe content to stretch to a decent width?
[02:35:29] <Putr> aggggg... why wouldent $("[name=uniqueName]"); select a an input element with <input name=uniqueName>
[02:36:19] <Putr> but there is an underslash in the name...hope that isnt screwing it up
[02:39:08] <Mateo_> Hi everyone !
[02:39:16] <macheleon> yes
[02:40:30] <sean`> Putr, only real life example
[02:40:33] <sean`> not fake code
[02:40:37] <Mateo_> I have some trouble, i'm trying to use .autocomplete, using the simple example code, but nothing triggers when i type in my field. The class i'm using is the good one, le libs are loaded... I don't know where to search now :s
[02:40:47] <Mateo_> and firebug don't show me any error
[02:41:02] <ryangreene> JKarsrud: So.. that didn't work out for me
[02:41:06] <ryangreene> (function($) {
[02:41:07] <ryangreene>            $('#realBody').focus();
[02:41:07] <ryangreene>             });(jQuery);
[02:42:30] <Putr> sean`: can't. working on a very large inhouse legacy aplication (that's written very, very badly)
[02:42:36] <ndee> when I try to download a custom theme from themeroller, it stalls at 67.5kb, does it work for anyone else?

[02:43:16] <ryangreene> Should I add something to the html?
[02:43:26] <sean`> ryangreene, use a pastebin
[02:43:29] <ryangreene> other than the .js file being called
[02:43:34] <Putr> sean`: no i mean i cant show you the entire example (knowing this app there's probably something very, very weird going on). But shure
[02:43:37] <ranza> why is this not adding a li around my a

[02:44:32] <sean`> Putr, use double qutoes for selectors
[02:44:37] <ranza> console.log says so. Also the browser if i append it
[02:44:42] <sean`> ranza, d?
[02:44:46] <Putr> sean`: thanks, let me try that

[03:11:51] <Patatouf> Kambfhase, but i am sure that the "start" var is not refreshed because i tried to delete first function $.getJSON and see what happens. When I change the first select field, the second one is refreshed with the initial $('#start').val() and not the new one

[03:24:20] <Kambfhase> soc42: you try to be XML-conform, but you are doing it wrong.
[03:24:52] <soc42> so what's the trick about it?
[03:24:56] <aaronmcadam> Kambfhase, you need return false, you don't need # for it to work
[03:25:12] <aaronmcadam> the reason it works with # is because the link doesn't go anywhere

[03:26:02] <aaronmcadam> Kambfhase, soc42 http://jsfiddle.net/NWkGh/2/

[04:50:18] <Bittarman> basilbear, all you get, is the html.. it doesn't even get any scripts / css files from link/script tagss
[04:50:25] <Bittarman> it doens't get any images....
[04:50:31] <Bittarman> it *JUST* gets the html page.
[04:50:40] <Bittarman> nothing more, nothing less.
[04:50:57] <Bittarman> and before you ask.. no. theres nothing to make it do so either.
[04:51:09] <blackspotwiggins> slartsa, inside event handlers this refers to the element it is triggered
[04:51:17] <basilbear> bittarman - got it, well it was a long shot after failing to get a PHP session to be recognised by a page called with curl
[04:51:27] <blackspotwiggins> so if you want the anchor's target then this.href would work
[04:52:32] <slartsa> blackspotwiggins: thanks for answering. no I don't want the anchors target but what the text is between <a> tags
[04:52:55] <basilbear> thanks
[04:53:12] <slartsa> blackspotwiggins: like so: <a href="#" id="form">image1.jpg</a>
[04:55:01] <blackspotwiggins> slartsa, $(this).text() is probably the safest then
[04:55:50] <slartsa> oh ok it was that simple, thanks alot :)
[05:00:49] <Mateo_> Hey :)
[05:02:30] <Mateo_> I'm using jquery autocomplete, and unfortunatly my json return is not a simple one ( like {a, b, c} ), more something like { a, b,  { c1, c2, c2 }}, how do i say to autocomplete to use the {c1, c2, c3} part instead of the whole thing
[05:02:33] <Mateo_> please
[05:02:42] <rns> is there a way I can put an if condition in this to update different div containers depending on a variable in the json response? http://dpaste.com/560141/
[05:03:32] <aaronmcadam> rns, just do: if ( html.value ) { ... }
[05:04:46] <rns> aaronmcadam, so get rid of line 4?
[05:04:57] <sadmicrowave> wow that reminds me how much I hate the .post() function. It looks so...ugly (no offense rns) it's not you it's the function
[05:05:11] <aaronmcadam> uh
[05:05:15] <aaronmcadam> ok?
[05:05:25] <sadmicrowave> rns no put line 4 in the if statement if that is what you want done conditionally
[05:05:30] <Chib> it's not you, it's the function... that old chestnut!
[05:05:37] <sadmicrowave> chib lol
[05:05:39] <aaronmcadam> ?bullshit
[05:05:44] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, jquery.icolor | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/icolor
[05:05:49] <aaronmcadam> :D
[05:05:59] <rns> aaronmcadam, I am returning a json dictionary, so I need to check one of the keys to determine which div to render the other keys to
[05:06:07] <aaronmcadam> yep
[05:06:17] <rns> aaronmcadam, any way you can show me an example?  I'm not quite sure I follow you.
[05:06:17] <aaronmcadam> I wasn't talking to you really :P
[05:06:22] <aaronmcadam> it's simple
[05:06:45] <aaronmcadam> say you have in your json: { "isValid" : true }
[05:06:51] <aaronmcadam> etc etc etc
[05:07:14] <aaronmcadam> in your example code, you could do if ( html.isValid ) { ... }
[05:07:48] <aaronmcadam> if it was { "content" : "blablabla" }
[05:07:50] <rns> aaronmcadam, where do I put that?  Can you edit my dpaste?
[05:07:56] <aaronmcadam> you'd do if ( html.content ) { ... }
[05:08:03] <aaronmcadam> uh in your callback function dude
[05:08:08] <aaronmcadam> above line 4
[05:08:14] <Chib> Mateo_: not sure if anyone understands what you're asking, i don't s:
[05:08:23] <sadmicrowave> rns is it the .scrollTable() that you want to do conditionally?
[05:08:35] <rns> sadmicrowave, yes
[05:08:37] <aaronmcadam> Mateo_, you might have to filter down your json first
[05:08:41] <sadmicrowave> rns ok hold on
[05:09:47] <Mateo_> Chib: oh sorry.. i'm using that exemple: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple-remote    but my json is not as simple as the one used, like i show before, and i wonder how to modify that exemple to work with mine
[05:09:53] <sadmicrowave> rns http://dpaste.com/560144/
[05:10:07] <Mateo_> aaronmcadam: on the server side?
[05:10:16] <aaronmcadam> Mateo_, probably yeah
[05:10:29] <aaronmcadam> what language are you using?
[05:10:49] <Mateo_> aaronmcadam: i would prefer not to, i'm trying to use that with a wordpress install, using the classic functions
[05:10:58] <Mateo_> aaronmcadam: php :)
[05:10:59] <aaronmcadam> classic???
[05:11:12] <aaronmcadam> I don't use wordpress
[05:11:27] <aaronmcadam> you should be able to restructure your data and then json_encode it
[05:11:28] <sadmicrowave> what is classic?
[05:11:54] <aaronmcadam> i.e. DON'T concatenate it yourself
[05:12:08] <Mateo_> sorry, it's just my english :)
[05:12:09] <rns> sadmicrowave, thank you that is very helpful.  So if I wanted to update other divs based on a check, could I do it like this? http://dpaste.com/560145/
[05:12:15] <Mateo_> ok, i'm going to see what iu can do
[05:12:19] <Mateo_> thank you all
[05:13:08] <sadmicrowave> rns your syntax is alittle off but yes, an if statement is done like this if( condition ){ //function } else { //function2 };
[05:13:09] <aaronmcadam> yeah rns, just check your braces on your if statements
[05:13:47] <sadmicrowave> rns http://dpaste.com/560149/
[05:14:34] <Krambfhase> sadmicrowave: line 6 is wrong.
[05:14:40] <rns> sadmicrowave, cool thanks I will try this.  And the else branch should update my example_container2 element with what's in html?
[05:15:07] <aaronmcadam> make sure to always put in semicolons rns
[05:15:22] <rns> sadmicrowave, should I use html.some_key if I only want to update example_container2 with a particular key in my json dict?
[05:15:22] <sadmicrowave> Krambfhase, your right
[05:15:24] <aaronmcadam> inside your if statement braces
[05:16:19] <sadmicrowave> fixed http://dpaste.com/560150/
[05:17:12] <Krambfhase> sadmicrowave: line 8 is wrong, see: http://dpaste.com/560151/
[05:17:57] <sadmicrowave> rns this is basic if statement stuff. if your variable = some value then do something.  so.. if( html.some_key ){ //do something };
[05:18:13] <sadmicrowave> Krambfhase, geez yea, I wasn't looking at the rest of his code, just the if statement
[05:18:21] <sadmicrowave> but nonetheless, thanks
[05:18:25] <Krambfhase> :)
[05:18:38] <rns> Krambfhase, on line 8 could I replace 'Some HTML' with one of my keys in my json dict?  For example html.some_key?
[05:18:42] <warky> if i have "$('#foo button').live('click', function () {" how can i get the name of the caller (in this case #foo), so i can alert() it?
[05:18:44] <aaronmcadam> sadmicrowave, that if condition uses type coercion
[05:18:47] <Krambfhase> rns: yeah
[05:18:51] <aaronmcadam> it's an important thing to know
[05:19:00] <rns> cool, thanks everyone
[05:19:05] <rns> I will give it a try
[05:19:19] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't mean it /equals/ anything, it means it if it returns a truthy value
[05:19:27] <aaronmcadam> as in if it  exists
[05:19:44] <Krambfhase> warky: the "caller" will be the button, not #foo!
[05:20:01] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, true, I was trying to explain the basic concept of an if statement to him since he didn't seem to quiet understand it
[05:20:08] <[gr]ouzo12> Hello.In my design i have a header div witch i want it to .animate 3 different height values(Current height 30px,1st value 100,2nd 160 and 3rd 130) before it stops .When i write the values it jumps on last value only.Any tips?
[05:20:08] <warky> Krambfhase, ya, but i want class of parent
[05:20:16] <aaronmcadam> yeah not a programmer is he hehe
[05:20:29] <sadmicrowave> its cool though, we all started somewhere
[05:20:33] <warky> Krambfhase, button has a parent, i want name of that class
[05:20:44] <aaronmcadam> warky, $(this).parent()[0].className
[05:21:07] <warky> aaronmcadam, thanks, ill try that
[05:21:08] <Krambfhase> warky: if you want the parenst class do $(this).parent().attr('class') but #foo is not a class ;)
[05:21:10] <rns> Krambfhase, how would I check the value of one of my json dict keys?  instead of if ( html.isValid ), could I do if (html.some_key == 'whatever' ) ?
[05:21:19] <warky> Krambfhase, true, its an ID, not a CLASS
[05:21:27] <aaronmcadam> warky, $(this).parent()[0].id then
[05:21:46] <aaronmcadam> rns yeah
[05:21:49] <sadmicrowave> warky, $(this).parent().attr('id') or whatever attribute you want to alert
[05:22:10] <aaronmcadam> don't need the attr function for that tho, it's already been retrieved
[05:22:13] <Krambfhase> aaronmcadam: i like how you mix jQuery with native to create crazy code
[05:22:18] <aaronmcadam> uh
[05:22:20] <warky> $(this).parent().attr('id') or $(this).parent()[0].id ?
[05:22:31] <aaronmcadam> the [0] one is faster
[05:22:41] <aaronmcadam> Krambfhase, it's knowing the language :p
[05:22:58] <sadmicrowave> Krambfhase, lol
[05:23:00] <aaronmcadam> didn't you know JavaScript is the best jQuery plugin ever!
[05:23:12] <Krambfhase> you know whats even faster? this.parentNode.id
[05:23:21] <sadmicrowave> Krambfhase++
[05:23:32] <aaronmcadam> ++Krambfhase
[05:24:14] <aaronmcadam> warky you understand the difference right?
[05:24:17] <{-_-\\\> are there any "toggle" functions in jquery
[05:24:20] <aaronmcadam> ha
[05:24:26] <Krambfhase> aaronmcadam: fucking hate JavaScript for this crazy api. i mean, why did they ruin the nice jquery one?
[05:24:27] <warky> aaronmcadam, no i dont, also neither works
[05:24:29] <aaronmcadam> definately a case of RTFM
[05:24:34] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[05:24:47] <warky> {-_-\\\, yes there are, .toggle();
[05:24:48] <{-_-\\\> like if ($('#...').attr('display')=='none') $('#...').show(); else $('#...').hide();

[05:31:40] <Krambfhase> [gr]ouzo12: haha, not thats not how it works :)
[05:31:46] <aaronmcadam> yeah u didn't set to onload silly
[05:31:47] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, you should put each .animate() as a callback of the previous one
[05:32:15] <warky> aaronmcadam, but it still dont work. you got it to work?
[05:33:02] <[gr]ouzo12> haha,k got it :D Could u please also explain what is the use of the function witch appears @ line 9?
[05:33:55] <aaronmcadam> yes warky

[05:34:40] <Krambfhase> ?p @ Hazamonzo

[05:34:41] <aaronmcadam> your ids were weird you put #foo in them
[05:34:48] <warky> oh
[05:34:53] <aaronmcadam> wrong selector :P
[05:34:56] <Krambfhase> [gr]ouzo12: the fadein or the function(){ ...} ?
[05:35:03] <aaronmcadam> you'd have needed ##foo :P
[05:35:17] <[gr]ouzo12> the "function(){..}
[05:35:39] <{-_-\\\> how can i make show/hide toggle?
[05:35:48] <{-_-\\\> without using .toggle()
[05:35:51] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[05:35:58] <aaronmcadam> why don't you want to use toggle?
[05:36:35] <Krambfhase> [gr]ouzo12: its the callback that is executed, when the animation is done. since it does not actually do anything you can leave it out
[05:37:00] <Hazamonzo> Okay so this is the code: http://pastebin.com/An8ta448 (maybe you were interested Krambfhase?)
[05:37:19] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, what about this? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/422319/

[05:45:31] <Krambfhase> Hazamonzo: your keys, must be in double quotes. http://jsonlint.com/
[05:45:35] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: can I bother you with one more question? :D
[05:45:44] <sadmicrowave> HEY BUDDY!
[05:45:47] <sadmicrowave> sure
[05:46:18] <Hazamonzo> Krambfhase: oh i see. I'd better check my webapp :)
[05:47:17] <slartsa> so you remember how we were creating those elements yesterday. now I face a problem where they are generated one above another and the more I create them the lower they go in my page. but they need to be created into the same spot disregarding the positions and sizes of each other
[05:47:51] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, so you want them to overlap?
[05:48:00] <slartsa> oooh that was the word :D
[05:48:04] <sadmicrowave> one on top of another on top of another on top of another
[05:48:05] <slartsa> yes
[05:48:12] <sadmicrowave> can you post your page again
[05:49:10] <Krambfhase> position:fixed ?
[05:49:30] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: http://tyoton.com/tyoton/pdffi/jquery-test.htm
[05:50:08] <sadmicrowave> so you want number 2,3,4,5,etc to appear EXACTLY where number 1 appears?
[05:50:23] <slartsa> ..and one silly thing is that I have to position them top:0;left:0; so they know that the actual top:0;left:0; is where to start counting the pixels from
[05:50:32] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: yes
[05:50:46] <Mateo_> great, i almost did it :) Now my autocomplete works BUT the last thing that i would to to is that: i have a fieldset, with input fields AND an input with autocomplete. i have a button to duplicate this fieldset, and the autocomplete won't work in the new fieldset, probably because it wasn't in the DOM... Anyone has already encountered something like that please?
[05:51:01] <ejo> What's a good way (or any way) to detect whether an <img> tag successfully loads an image?
[05:51:08] <warky> if i want a selector for any button under #a #b and #c, do i do $('#a button, #b button, #c button'); or is there any other way?
[05:51:08] <ejo> I need to detect when they *don't* actually
[05:51:11] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, in the .css() try adding position: 'absolute'
[05:51:29] <aaronmcadam> warky, apply a class plese
[05:51:32] <aaronmcadam> please
[05:51:41] <aaronmcadam> I hate seeing selectors like that
[05:51:50] <warky> aaronmcadam, what i did wrong?
[05:52:05] <Krambfhase> warky: you could do $('#a, #b, #c').find('button')
[05:52:14] <aaronmcadam> just use a class so instead of $( #x, #y, #z )
[05:52:20] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, also, in .css() and many other functions when you use integers you don't need quotes around them. i.e. .css({top: 0, left: 0 })
[05:52:24] <aaronmcadam> just one .awesome will do
[05:52:36] <ejo> that's my favorite class name...
[05:52:37] <aaronmcadam> ids are unmaintainable
[05:52:45] <notmycupoftea> hi guys, I'm stuck on this one: http://pastebin.com/WCnTjdW0. In saveClick this refers to the jQuery object but I would also like to access the methods and attributes of X but don't see how...
[05:52:52] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: oh crap you wizard :)
[05:52:55] <Krambfhase> ?eval $('.awesome')
[05:52:56] <bot-t> Krambfhase: []
[05:53:02] <sadmicrowave> :)
[05:53:22] <slartsa> I tried giving them absolute positions from the css but that didn't work
[05:53:48] <ejo> I suppose the only real way to tell that an image tag isn't loading anything is to wait long enough, then test its dimensions?
[05:54:24] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, heres why, the default position property for elements is 'relative' meaning you are positioning each element top:0px and left:0px from each previous element.  changing it to position:absolute means that each element will be positioned top:0px and left:0px from the window so you will always end up at the top left corner that way
[05:54:50] <aaronmcadam> ?wtf is css?
[05:54:51] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, I am right and the entire Industry is wrong - Jan 9, 2008 ... You are not using frames or CSS to mimic frames. This is not your fault. You were taught not to use frames in your class. ... http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/I-am-right-and-the-entire-Industry-is-wrong.aspx
[05:54:58] <slartsa> *sigh* have alot to learn..
[05:55:06] <sadmicrowave> that why we are here
[05:55:19] <slartsa> you poor guys
[05:55:22] <slartsa> :D
[05:55:35] <slartsa> facing all those dorky questions on a daily basis
[05:55:41] <Krambfhase> aaronmcadam: CSS is a ego shooter. nothin for under aged though
[05:55:47] <sadmicrowave> we can stop anytime we want
[05:55:53] <aaronmcadam> why can't I use ajax? :D
[05:56:21] <aaronmcadam> slartsa, have you tried JavaScript, it's an awesome plugin for jQuery :D
[05:56:21] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, I personally like sharing what I know.  javascript and jQuery start making sense really fast once you get the basics
[05:56:28] <Krambfhase> This jQuery it's driving me madness!
[05:56:28] <sadmicrowave> lol
[05:56:46] <aaronmcadam> it solidifies your knowledge when u help others
[05:56:57] <sadmicrowave> I agree
[05:57:17] <aaronmcadam> but it's amazing how many people expect you to know exactly what it is they're trying to do
[05:57:18] <sadmicrowave> not to mention it can make you feel like a badass
[05:57:25] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: for several months I tried to get a hand of mootools but only after a few days in jquery things make more sense to me
[05:57:31] <Hazamonzo> Krambfhase: Ahh looks like it was just the way the JSON FF plugin was rendering the JSON output on my browser. This is the actual JSON: http://pastebin.com/yq7mqwex
[05:57:37] <sadmicrowave> mootools--
[05:57:46] <sadmicrowave> booo
[05:57:49] <slartsa> haha
[05:58:02] <aaronmcadam> you should be learning JavaScript first
[05:58:12] <Krambfhase> Hazamonzo: well, that looks ok
[05:58:12] <aaronmcadam> or at least the basics alongside jQuery
[05:58:13] <slartsa> aaronmcadam: thanks for the tip
[05:58:53] <bjensen> can I detect when something isnt visible in the browser anymore?
[05:58:53] <Hazamonzo> indeed. So im trying to understand how i can debug this small amount of code and understand why the $.ajax is returning the error function
[05:59:24] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, thats very true, since jQuery and MooTools are just javascript frameworks if you use straight javascript for certain things your functions will go A LOT faster
[05:59:26] <aaronmcadam> slartsa, yeah don't depend on jQuery too much, go n try and learn the why behind some of the "magic"
[05:59:34] <bjensen> I need to autosave a form using ajax, but there are many ways the user can exit the form so I need to be able to check if its still viisible
[05:59:54] <aaronmcadam> ?:hidden @bjensen
[05:59:55] <bot-t> bjensen, :hidden: Selects all elements that are hidden. http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[06:00:22] <aaronmcadam> bjensen so $().is(':hidden') ....
[06:00:24] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, aaronmcadam but jQuery is def. the way to go for stuff like .animate(), .toggle(), .fadeOut/In()
[06:00:28] <ejo> "Secure multi-mediation is the future of all webbing." -- Gary
[06:00:32] <aaronmcadam> and DOM
[06:00:35] <bjensen> thank you Aamir
[06:00:38] <bjensen> agh
[06:00:39] <sadmicrowave> yes
[06:00:42] <bjensen> aaronmcadam:
[06:00:56] <Hazamonzo> Krambfhase: You have any pointers for me mate? :)
[06:01:02] <aaronmcadam> np bjensen
[06:01:21] <Krambfhase> Hazamonzo: sorry, no.
[06:01:27] <Hazamonzo> Krambfhase: nps
[06:01:56] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: I'm going to use many of them in the same website so I figured I might just use it with this page as well now that it's all fired up
[06:02:13] <Hazamonzo> im thinking if i can execute that json url directly and get a resultset but im not sure why the $.ajax function would be having a problem. It looks pretty simple
[06:02:25] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, many what? sorry, what are we talking about now?
[06:02:50] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: if there is a point of using jquery or not
[06:03:06] <aaronmcadam> depends what you're doing slartsa
[06:03:13] <sadmicrowave> oh yea
[06:03:50] <sadmicrowave> but I don't know of many things you can do with MooTools or other jfs' that you can't do with jQuery
[06:03:50] <aaronmcadam> it will help you understand js a bit better maybe
[06:04:12] <sadmicrowave> *jsf's
[06:04:13] <aaronmcadam> there are plenty of things jQuery doesn't do by design
[06:04:29] <sadmicrowave> thats when you force it :)
[06:04:34] <aaronmcadam> it's only meant to be a utility library
[06:04:37] <aaronmcadam> not a framework
[06:04:42] <slartsa> aaronmcadam: I was going to need jquery to handle my animations and video playing on the very same website so I figured I might just use it to this particular project as well
[06:04:45] <aaronmcadam> use backbone :D
[06:04:54] <Hazamonzo> Krambfhase: oh dear.... it was a missing / at the beginning of the json URL...
[06:05:03] <Krambfhase> :/
[06:05:22] <Hazamonzo> Krambfhase: Hurrah! :D
[06:05:28] <aaronmcadam> keep goin slartsa
[06:05:29] <slartsa> aaronmcadam: might be that it's not the most efficient way of doing things but at least I'm learning as I'm using it
[06:05:48] <aaronmcadam> slartsa you gotta start somewhere dude!
[06:05:59] <sadmicrowave> geez I could sit on here all day and not get any work done, but then I wouldn't be employed much longer. So, ping me if you need me
[06:06:12] <aaronmcadam> yeah i got shit to do too
[06:06:20] <aaronmcadam> jquery mobile stufffff
[06:06:26] <sadmicrowave> what time is it there?
[06:06:30] <aaronmcadam> me?
[06:06:33] <sadmicrowave> yea
[06:06:36] <aaronmcadam> 14:06
[06:06:41] <sadmicrowave> (I always find it interesting where people are)
[06:06:50] <slartsa> it's 16:06 here
[06:06:51] <Krambfhase> jquery mobile? is that the codename for ES6?
[06:06:51] <aaronmcadam> in england from ireland
[06:07:00] <creati29> not really jquery related sorry but does anyone know why characters are coming out as &dollar; instead of a dollar sign in ie 9?
[06:07:11] <aaronmcadam> you referring to ecmascript?
[06:07:12] <sadmicrowave> 8:06am here, texas USA
[06:07:38] <aaronmcadam> creati29, are you setting encoding meta tags?
[06:07:48] <hiryu> someone can help me? i don't understanding how resolve a problem (i have found the solution on goole groups)
[06:08:25] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: heard there was a raging fire in tx some time ago. I have some friends living in ft worth and I was a bit conserned
[06:08:28] <sadmicrowave> hiryu, I've got time for 1 more, whats up?
[06:08:29] <warky> http://jsfiddle.net/yVHDW/ -- why only first button works?
[06:08:30] <Predat0r> hi
[06:08:35] <creati29> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /> is what i'm using, is this correct?
[06:08:52] <creati29> never had any problems with it before and i'm getting $ in FF, but in ie getting &dollar; >.<
[06:08:53] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, yea there are raging fires around here all the time, I'm acouple hours from ft worth
[06:09:03] <slartsa> :/
[06:09:24] <Krambfhase> warky: http://paulirish.com/2010/on-jquery-live/
[06:09:31] <sadmicrowave> but thats just because it's drying than a MF around here
[06:10:27] <sadmicrowave> and because we have idiots that thing its ok to light cigarettes in the middle of a field
[06:10:34] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: I was there a few years back and it was summer then. +40c degrees in shadow is alot for me who's gotten used to somewhat +20c
[06:10:41] <hiryu> warky: read Krambfhase link
[06:10:59] <sadmicrowave> yea it was 110f yesterday
[06:11:08] <slartsa> usch
[06:11:27] <warky> hiryu, i looked at it some, what im supposed to do?
[06:11:32] <creati29> whats the correct term for those characters denoted by an ampersand, so i can look for some help on google for my problem?
[06:11:45] <Krambfhase> Temperature.internationalize('110f')
[06:11:57] <sadmicrowave> Krambfhase, lol
[06:12:23] <sadmicrowave> 43.333333333 degrees C
[06:12:25] <creati29> also on a seperate issue :p does var date = new Date(); store an object or a string?
[06:12:36] <creati29> <<< JS noob, learning though :P
[06:12:41] <rns> okay, so I am returning html as context from the server, but this isn't updating my page for some reason:  http://dpaste.com/560179/
[06:13:00] <Krambfhase> creati29: its an date-object
[06:13:06] <slartsa> creati29: have you tried what things look when you html5:fy your site?
[06:13:21] <sadmicrowave> rns, what exactly are you returning?
[06:13:27] <warky> aaronmcadam, on my code http://jsfiddle.net/yVHDW/ only the first button works :(
[06:13:35] <slartsa> creati29: ..and by "html5:fy" I mean use html5 doctype and meta's
[06:14:35] <hiryu> lol why anyone reply to me?:)
[06:14:37] <Predat0r> hey, if i append a tag into a div on my page in FireBug, why dont do it in run time in my script
[06:14:38] <Predat0r> ?
[06:14:40] <creati29> Krambfhase: the reason that i ask is when i then follow this up with $('#dateinput').val(date); and try to post the input, nothing posts
[06:14:45] <rns> sadmicrowave, here is my serverside code.  This just returns the html for some forms, and also a python object containing numbers.  According to firebug this is getting processed and returned, except it just not showing up on the page http://dpaste.com/560181/
[06:14:49] <sadmicrowave> warky,  http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/yVHDW/1/
[06:14:50] <creati29> so how do i turn this date object into a text string?
[06:15:04] <creati29> slartsa: html doctype is just opened as <html>?
[06:15:11] <creati29> slartsa: I havnt by the way :P
[06:15:12] <Krambfhase> creati29: add +'' do your date
[06:15:18] <Krambfhase> *to
[06:15:43] <creati29> Krambfhase: how do yo umean sorry?
[06:15:54] <warky> sadmicrowave, thanks! :)
[06:15:59] <warky> sadmicrowave, cool, your url says sadmicrowave  :D
[06:16:09] <Krambfhase> $('#dateinput').val(date + "");
[06:16:15] <sadmicrowave> rns, try putting some alerts like alert('hello world') in your if statement in places just to make sure your code is getting that far
[06:16:35] <sadmicrowave> warky, it's because I have a jsfiddle account
[06:16:42] <Cork> creati29: or you can do (new Date()).toString()
[06:16:49] <Cork> i find that cleaner
[06:16:51] <warky> sadmicrowave, oh cool
[06:17:22] <blackspotwiggins> please dont use alert() for debugging
[06:17:38] <sadmicrowave> warky, you can also do that using jquery if you prefer instead of javascript node like so: $(this).parent().attr('id')
[06:17:40] <slartsa> warky: hit the Login/Sign up in top right. that way when your stuff will stay there
[06:17:41] <Cork> "don't kill the kitten" :D
[06:18:08] <slartsa> warky: meaning you can continue where you left the last time just by logging in
[06:18:17] <sadmicrowave> warky, slartsa yea it will keep a log of all your 'fiddle's'
[06:18:19] <xec> always use confirm() for debugging. that way you get to click "no" if you dont like what you get
[06:18:30] <rns> sadmicrowave, like this? I'm not seeing any alert: http://dpaste.com/560185/
[06:18:39] <slartsa> I've lost tons of code by not logging in :D
[06:19:04] <sadmicrowave> rns, exactly, now if you arn't seeing your alert then clearly you arn't getting returned what you think you are
[06:19:27] <sadmicrowave> rns, now you have to figure out why html.display does not equal 'proforma'
[06:20:16] <creati29> what is the proper name for ampersand characters?
[06:20:22] <creati29> e.g. &dollar; ?
[06:20:28] <xec> html entities
[06:20:34] <creati29> thanks :)
[06:20:42] <sadmicrowave> rns, obviously the 'display' variable used on the python side does not equal 'proforma' when it is getting returned
[06:21:04] <warky> sadmicrowave, but your code would trigger on ALL buttons on the page, say i just want it to trigger on the buttons in #one and #two, then it dont work http://jsfiddle.net/yVHDW/2/
[06:21:13] <sadmicrowave> rns, then do the same thing for the else if statement and figure out why html.display does not equal 'dcf' either
[06:22:01] <sadmicrowave> warky, you need a comma to separate your elements in your selector $("#one, #two")
[06:22:35] <sadmicrowave> warky, if you do that it is no longer this.parentNode.id it is just this.id
[06:22:52] <creati29> do you think its ok to use a dollar sign instead of html entity for it?
[06:23:22] <warky> sadmicrowave, oh, but http://jsfiddle.net/yVHDW/5/ now only first button works, not second
[06:23:42] <creati29> anyone?
[06:23:53] <sadmicrowave> warky, you can't chain like that. you need your event handler first. hold on I'll show you
[06:24:01] <warky> okie
[06:24:27] <warky> sadmicrowave, cuz when i did '#one button, #two button' then it worked, but then ppl in this channel said thats ugly
[06:24:40] <sadmicrowave> warky, if you are trying to alert the id of what you click then you don't need to .find('button') because button doesn't have an id anyways
[06:25:11] <warky> sadmicrowave, i dont want that, i want the id of the parent's parent of the button
[06:25:42] <sadmicrowave> warky, do you have to have parents? can you just have buttons without the containing divs?
[06:26:08] <xec> warky:  this was the button element? http://jsfiddle.net/yVHDW/6/
[06:26:29] <warky> sadmicrowave, must have parents, else it shouldnt trigger
[06:26:48] <sadmicrowave> warky,  why would doing this not work? http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/yVHDW/7/
[06:27:04] <Krambfhase> warky: did you read the link i  gave you?
[06:27:13] <warky> xec, oh that works
[06:27:34] <warky> Krambfhase, i glimsed through it, it says live is bad for performance and cant be used on nested objects or something
[06:27:37] <sadmicrowave> warky, also, you don't need to include .live() unless these elements are being added after DOM ready
[06:27:50] <warky> sadmicrowave, they are being added after the DOM ready
[06:27:56] <sadmicrowave> ok
[06:27:57] <sadmicrowave> just checking
[06:28:05] <Krambfhase> in this ccas is prefer you'd use .delegate!
[06:28:37] <warky> sadmicrowave, that wont work, cuz it gets triggered on click DIV too, not only when click on BUTTON
[06:29:06] <Krambfhase> warky: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/yVHDW/8/
[06:29:45] <sadmicrowave> Krambfhase, that doesn't alert anything
[06:29:56] <sadmicrowave> this.parentNode.id
[06:29:56] <Krambfhase> true.
[06:29:58] <warky> Krambfhase, try it you. click button, nothing gets displayed
[06:30:00] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: in your example there was .remove() but is there a point in using .empty() as well?
[06:30:17] <doncams> Krambfhase, almighty God of JavaScript... $("#somedivid img").attr("width","somepixels"); doesn't work for all img. how do I do this?
[06:30:22] <slartsa> I mean if an element of same value is created afterwards
[06:30:27] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, you will have to show me, i've slept since then
[06:31:01] <slartsa> look up the same page as I pasted 15mins ago :)
[06:31:04] <jeffsmykil> there no way to know what this is?
[06:31:04] <jeffsmykil> Error: uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: NaN)
[06:31:09] <sadmicrowave> doncams, thats only going to work for img tags within the #somedivid element
[06:31:18] <doncams> sadmicrowave, it doesn't
[06:31:23] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: you're not getting any work done :D
[06:31:46] <xec> warky: the button is this agan, mixed mine and Krambfhase's code; http://jsfiddle.net/yVHDW/9/
[06:31:52] <Krambfhase> doesn't work for all img. << wow, i bet that sucks, eh?
[06:31:53] <sadmicrowave> doncams, can you post in jsfiddle
[06:32:24] <doncams> ooops. my bad, i forgot the img tag in selector
[06:32:29] <warky> xec, just using 'this.parentNode.id' would work too
[06:32:29] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:32:41] <warky> Krambfhase, your could would work if you did 'this.parentNode.id'
[06:32:54] <jomofcw> Hi there :)
[06:33:00] <xec> warky: yes, if youre sure the button will always be one level under the div with the id
[06:33:04] <Krambfhase> warky: ok, go fot it then! :)
[06:33:29] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, I personally like .remove() better because it will actually remove the DOM elements from the page entirely
[06:33:30] <kborchers> bot-t: hey
[06:33:30] <bot-t> Hey kborchers
[06:33:35] <sadmicrowave> let me check on .empty()
[06:33:42] <doncams> sadmicrowave, can I pm you?
[06:33:45] <Hazamonzo> so now i have my first json resultset into my webapp im thinking how to structure the next json call... i have a set of hyperlinks that i can use to call a new json url... maybe i should attach these hyperlinks to a new jquery function that will execute the new JSON url?
[06:33:50] <Hazamonzo> Maybe there is a better design?
[06:33:52] <xec> warky: but in some of the snippets you had nested div's
[06:33:58] <sadmicrowave> ok
[06:34:01] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: no need to check, it was just a thought :)
[06:34:11] <slartsa> you should get work done already D:
[06:34:12] <slartsa> :D
[06:34:16] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, no, I'm curious now
[06:34:16] <warky> xec, the button will always be 2 levels under the div with the id
[06:34:27] <warky> xec, it should be <div id="one"><div><button>
[06:35:08] <xec> warky: ok, then this.parentNode.id wont work. you could ofc just add another parentNode
[06:35:53] <aaronmcadam> warky
[06:35:59] <hiryu> if i use $('myel').dialog() how restore in original position beforeClose?
[06:36:00] <aaronmcadam> add a class to the divs you want
[06:36:15] <aaronmcadam> and then do $( 'button' ).closest( 'classname')
[06:36:27] <xec> warky: the code i gave you will look for the closest div that has an id
[06:36:27] <aaronmcadam> try that
[06:36:45] <mauriez> Hi! is it possible to attach an event to a function? each time hide() is called i wish to run an extra function.. or should i overwrite .hide() somehow to do this ?
[06:37:15] <kborchers> mauriez: why don
[06:37:19] <smevans> anyone!! I have been trying for two days now to download JQuery UI v1.8.13 and everytime I get it it is corrupted and I am unable to unzip. Seems like this has been reported in the past, but no resolution. Any ideas?
[06:37:20] <kborchers> oops
[06:37:46] <kborchers> mauriez: why don't you just write a function that calls hide, then calls your other function and use that instead of just calling hide?
[06:37:55] <hiryu> if i use $('myel').dialog() how restore in original position before Close dialog?
[06:38:02] <Krambfhase> smevans: jquery ui is also hosted on googles cdn, maybe try that.
[06:38:27] <mauriez>   kborchers: doh! good idea! tnx
[06:38:35] <kborchers> np
[06:38:54] <smevans> Krambfhase: if I do that how am I able to have the theme that I want?
[06:39:17] <warky> xec, thanks, clever
[06:39:18] <Krambfhase> dunno, though it was a good idea though.
[06:39:25] <Krambfhase> +t
[06:39:40] <Krambfhase> its a know issue, hope they will fix it soon
[06:40:01] <kborchers> smevans: are you using IE? I think there is an issue with IE but downloads fine for me in chrome and ff
[06:40:36] <arminrosu> hey all
[06:40:46] <smevans> kborchers: did you just try downloading it? It will download but when you go to open it it can't because it is corrupted
[06:40:47] <arminrosu> trying to write a pixastic jquery plugin
[06:40:53] <arminrosu> http://www.pixastic.com/lib/docs/
[06:41:25] <arminrosu> well, it's just a wrapper, but it includes revert (as opposed to the official jq plugin)
[06:41:55] <arminrosu> thing is, pixastic returns a canvas element instead of an image, so I'm having trouble enbaling chaining
[06:42:04] <arminrosu> any tips?
[06:42:24] <kborchers> smevans: i do see that, hmmm.
[06:43:25] <sjnims> hi folks
[06:43:44] <Fogin[Work]> anyone know of a way to Open a Dialog on a Parent from inside a open Dialog,
[06:43:48] <sjnims> is there an issue w/ downloading themes created with the themeroller?
[06:44:03] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, it looks like you could use .empty() I'm still not sure how that is much different from .remove() but I think it's personal preference at this point
[06:45:54] <arminrosu> here's the code
[06:45:55] <arminrosu> http://pastebin.com/7DpUHAEH
[06:47:16] <sjnims> is there an issue w/ downloading themes created with the themeroller?
[06:50:54] <durre> I got a simple ajax call with jquery that seems to be going well (I can see the right response in firebug) but the callback function doesnt seem to get called. the alert is never made. this is the code: http://pastebin.com/Dpnu1hfx
[06:52:22] <Guest49170> does the theme for the jquery ui plugins have to be in a specific folder structure?
[06:53:12] <Cork> Guest49170: not if your ok with modifying the url()'s in the css files
[06:53:33] <Cork> the js files never directly calls for any css or img file
[06:53:39] <arminrosu> durre: $.get works fine for me
[06:53:48] <arminrosu> check your variables/events
[06:53:54] <Cork> Guest44110: so as long as the css can find the images its ok
[06:54:40] <Krambfhase> durre: maybe you have an error somewhere. try using $.ajax with an arror parameter
[06:56:42] <momito> heya folks
[06:58:47] <warky> are you supposed to put the javascript at the bottom of the page?
[06:59:19] <Bittarman> to stop it blocking the rendering of your page.
[06:59:47] <warky> if i put it at start, maybe it wont work
[06:59:56] <warky> bottom is good for javascript?
[07:00:34] <genu> Hey, what is the best way to modify the zoom property of the page? equivalent to the user pressing CTRL and + and and CTRL and -
[07:00:54] <durre> well well, invalid JSON
[07:01:25] <zmbmartin> is there something like contains selector but only matches if it is an exact match?
[07:01:55] <vindice> I've got a string which I'm converting to xml and adding to an xml doc, so: $(xmlString).appendTo(....); That works fine. But the issue is that doing that converts all of the attribute names in to lower case
[07:02:20] <vindice> so <node AnAttribute="False" /> becomes <node anattribute="False" />
[07:02:26] <Krambfhase> zmbmartin: so you want to check if the elemnts text is exactly "abc"?
[07:02:28] <vindice> Is there any way to change this behaviour?
[07:02:39] <arminrosu> why would an object passed as a plugin option
[07:02:42] <arminrosu> not work
[07:02:46] <zmbmartin> Krambfhase: yes
[07:02:56] <arminrosu> but defining the object in the plugin , it works
[07:03:04] <jeffsmykil> $("#MainContent_TheServiceHistory_ServiceRecordGrid tr:nth-child(5)").prepend("<tr class='rightColumnInformation'><td class='leftColumnDescription'>1</td><td class='rightColumnPadding'>1</td></tr>");
[07:03:08] <jeffsmykil> argh
[07:03:19] <jeffsmykil> well anyways that puts it in a table cell instead of a new tr
[07:03:20] <zmbmartin> Now it is showing anything that contains "abc" so it is not just a clever name.
[07:03:24] <Krambfhase> zmbmartin: try $('basic selection').filter(function(){ return $(this).text() == "abc";})
[07:06:02] <vindice> I should have put that better: why does $('<Node MyAttribte="False" />')[0] create the following: <node myattribute="false">  ? Is there any way to make jquery respect uppercase in tagnames and attributes?
[07:06:21] <warky> when shoud a jquery function return false?
[07:06:53] <sadmicrowave> when you want the function to exit itself
[07:06:56] <Krambfhase> warky: return false is a shortcut in eventhandlers for event.preventdefault() and event.stopPropagation()
[07:07:50] <zmbmartin> Krambfhase: thanks
[07:07:55] <warky> Krambfhase, if its not an eventhandler, then should i still be using return false?
[07:08:02] <jeffsmykil> how do you select the nth direct child?
[07:08:21] <vindice> hmm, I guess that answer to my question is that jquery doesn't have an xml parser, doing what I did uses its html parser, and tag names and attributes in html are not case-sensitive???
[07:08:43] <Krambfhase> jeffsmykil: $(this).children().eq( n)
[07:09:05] <jeffsmykil> eq?
[07:09:16] <Krambfhase> vindice: no, html is mostly lower case only.
[07:09:45] <Krambfhase> ?eq @ jeffsmykil
[07:09:45] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[07:09:56] <jeffsmykil> ty
[07:10:37] <vindice> Krambfhase: no to what?
[07:10:56] <Krambfhase> tag names and attributes in html are not case-sensitive???
[07:11:45] <vindice> Krambfhase: according to w3.org html attributes are not case-sensitive
[07:12:08] <vindice> convention is write them lower-case
[07:12:29] <Krambfhase> yeah, thats what i said( or meant to say)
[07:12:37] <vindice> it's very different
[07:12:43] <Woet> su
[07:13:06] <vindice> $('<Node MyAttribte="False" />') is processed by jquery's html parser. That's the issue I've got. Because xml attributes and tag names are very much case-sensitive
[07:13:30] <vindice> but what I don't get, is that if jquery ignores case in processing the string representation of an element
[07:13:44] <Krambfhase> jquery has no HTML parser, it passes it thorugh to the browser
[07:13:46] <vindice> why does it then match case when searching for an element
[07:13:57] <vindice> ahh
[07:15:29] <vindice> $('<Node MyAttribte="False" />') creates <node myattribute="False"/>. So case is ignored, all converted to lower-case. But then $(doc).find("Node[MyAttribute="False"])[0] does not return <node myattribute="False"/>
[07:15:34] <vindice> that seems pretty inconsistent to me
[07:15:56] <vindice> excuse poor use of double quotes in the find
[07:16:50] <anissaa> does any body know how to add <img> and <a> in a each and append it to a <div> ?
[07:18:24] <vindice> ahh, jquery 1.5 has jQuery.parseXML
[07:18:40] <timing> Hi
[07:18:43] <PKKid-Work> Hello
[07:18:53] <timing> I have this: <div><img/><br/>and some text</div>
[07:19:06] <timing> how do I get that text only?
[07:19:20] <timing> $('div').find('br').next() doesn't work;
[07:19:38] <PKKid-Work> try $('div').text() ?
[07:19:44] <kborchers> ?.text @ timing
[07:19:44] <bot-t> timing, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[07:20:28] <timing> thanks
[07:26:36] <jeffsmykil> damn it somemone the other day showed me how to move an element but now I cant remember the name of the technique
[07:27:09] <kborchers> ?insertBefore @ jeffsmykil
[07:27:10] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, .insertBefore(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements before the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[07:27:17] <arminrosu> ok, this will sound stupid but im slowly going mad
[07:27:35] <arminrosu> what does it mean when console.log outputs and array with elements
[07:27:47] <arminrosu> instead of an object/array
[07:28:00] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: so $("elementToMove").insertBefore("elementToBePlacedBefore") will move it
[07:28:04] <PKKid-Work> $('#newlocation').html($('#element_to_move')) would move the #element_to_move inside of #newlocation.
[07:28:24] <Krambfhase> PKKid-Work: no, it will not move, but copy
[07:28:26] <larzen-wrk> I am using DataTables and I am trying to add a checkbox column for selection.... Has anyone done htis?
[07:28:33] <jeffsmykil> yeah not sure that will work in my case
[07:28:37] <jeffsmykil> examining now
[07:28:52] <larzen-wrk> secondly, what does this do: $('td:eq(0)', 'sorting_1'). <--- can someone explain?
[07:29:05] <jeffsmykil> kborchers I need to move it into a table cell
[07:29:06] <PKKid-Work> Krambfhase, OOps, does my example make a copy?
[07:29:11] <jeffsmykil> so its not really before
[07:29:38] <Krambfhase> larzen-wrk: that is the same as $('sorting_1').find('td:eq(0)') afaik
[07:30:08] <aaronmcadam> gives it context larzen-wrk
[07:30:15] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: i think then you could do - $("elementToMove").appendTo("tdToInsertInto") I haven't tried that though
[07:30:30] <jeffsmykil> that might work
[07:30:31] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[07:30:44] <Krambfhase> .appendTo() works. trust me.
[07:31:01] <PKKid-Work> famous last words.. :)
[07:31:03] <larzen-wrk> aaronmcadam: I see - thanks!
[07:31:10] <Krambfhase> doing
[07:31:11] <kborchers> Krambfhase: thanks. i couldn't remeber if appendTo also moved or copied
[07:31:25] <kborchers> but figured it would move
[07:32:16] <Krambfhase> arminrosu: if you log a jquery object it will show up as an array of elements
[07:33:44] <Hazamonzo> hmm. im trying to attach a simple click function to some paragraphs.. i've followed the jquery .click docs and come up with this: http://pastebin.com/gKSQJ8kC But when i click the paragraph nothing happens. No error in firebug either. Thoughts?
[07:33:53] <arminrosu> Krambfhase: yup, I think that was my oversight. thanks :D
[07:35:13] <kborchers> Hazamonzo: you need to run your script on dom ready. it is firing before the paragraphs exist in the dom. wrap your $.ajax and click in $(function() { ..... });
[07:35:15] <larzen-wrk> so if I have a div, then inside a table, and I want to access the first row of the first columns.. how would I do that using this $(...) notation?
[07:35:22] <Krambfhase> Hazamonzo: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[07:35:45] <Hazamonzo> Krambfhase: Ahhh i think i've seen that before! Cheers! :D
[07:35:52] <Vaerros> larzen-wrk: the first cell in each column?
[07:36:03] <Vaerros> on each row, in other words?
[07:36:30] <kborchers> Hazamonzo: Krambfhase is right. try binding your click in the success callback after you append
[07:36:41] <aaronmcadam> larzen-wrk, $( 'table').find('tr').first()
[07:36:50] <larzen-wrk> The div has a class DTFC_BodyWrapper, the table has a class DTFC_Cloned and the tds have a class " sorting_1"
[07:37:46] <aaronmcadam> larzen-wrk, $( '.DTFC_Cloned').find('tr').first().find( 'td' );
[07:38:02] <larzen-wrk> let me try!
[07:38:38] <aaronmcadam> ?p @larzen-wrk
[07:38:38] <bot-t> larzen-wrk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:39:35] <thomb> is it possible to extend a jquery function? i'm using ui multidragable and would like to invoke a method call when mouse stops after dragging
[07:41:20] <sadmicrowave> thomb .draggable() has an event built in called stop
[07:42:01] <sadmicrowave> $.draggable({stop: function(event, ui){ //my function } });
[07:42:08] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: unfortuantely it looks like thomb is using a plugin and not UI's draggable
[07:42:25] <sadmicrowave> oooh yea, multidragable...
[07:42:38] <larzen-wrk> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/wEYUT/1/
[07:42:39] <thomb> i guess multidragable does not support that
[07:42:45] <kborchers> and i don't see any event binding in the docs for that
[07:43:15] <aaronmcadam> larzen-wrk, did you get what u wanted
[07:44:08] <larzen-wrk> aaronmcadam: I did not. I am essentially trying to add a checkbox to some data elements in DataTables
[07:44:20] <thomb> well, i could extend the mouseStop: function, but i will not be able to update afterwards
[07:44:55] <aaronmcadam> larzen-wrk, http://jsfiddle.net/wEYUT/2/
[07:45:42] <bbrandon> can i execute a javascript function inside .html()?
[07:46:10] <kborchers> bbrandon: no, what are you trying to do?
[07:46:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah pass a func to it
[07:46:17] <aaronmcadam> yes u can kborchers
[07:46:29] <aaronmcadam> you can pass a func which determines what the html will be
[07:46:32] <bbrandon> .html(alert('hi');)
[07:46:40] <aaronmcadam> it takes the element and the oldhtml value
[07:46:46] <aaronmcadam> ?html @ bbrandon
[07:46:46] <bot-t> bbrandon, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[07:47:02] <bbrandon> could i pass a variable in there?
[07:47:02] <aaronmcadam> don't worry bout that description, the api page shows u how
[07:47:07] <bbrandon> okay
[07:47:09] <bbrandon> thanks
[07:47:12] <aaronmcadam> np
[07:48:08] <larzen-wrk> aaronmcadam: jquery returns empty cells
[07:48:14] <aaronmcadam> not for me
[07:48:20] <aaronmcadam> can u not see my fiddle
[07:48:43] <aaronmcadam> larzen-wrk, http://jsfiddle.net/wEYUT/2/
[07:48:56] <aaronmcadam> the blue background?
[07:49:15] <arminrosu> can someone please have a look at this:
[07:49:16] <arminrosu> http://pastebin.com/YtvRiswv
[07:49:25] <arminrosu> trying to write a plugin
[07:50:04] <arminrosu> calling it in $('#id').each(function() { $(this).plugin() }); works
[07:50:27] <arminrosu> calling it directly doesn't
[07:51:05] <arminrosu> I suppose it's a chainability issue, but I don't know how to solve it
[07:51:11] <arminrosu> plz help
[07:51:42] <Krambfhase> arminrosu: what error do you get?
[07:52:02] <arminrosu> none, only that the plugin gets applied only to the ast element
[07:52:04] <arminrosu> *last
[07:52:40] <larzen-wrk> aaronmcadam: you are right - seems to work in here.. i am doing this in a callback function so who knows =)
[07:53:03] <markj> arminrosu you shouldnt be calling each on an id selector, there should only be one of them :p slightly unrelated
[07:53:38] <rns> why does the name of a submit button not get passed in with .post data?
[07:53:42] <arminrosu> markj: lol, i wrote the pseudocode wrong, should've been $('#id li')
[07:54:28] <arminrosu> rns: you mean the name or value tag?
[07:54:45] <rns> arminrosu, the name
[07:55:18] <arminrosu> rns: set the value tag, thats what gets sent
[07:55:26] <arminrosu> i mean attribute
[07:55:28] <arminrosu> not tag
[07:55:44] <arminrosu> <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
[07:56:12] <arminrosu> Krambfhase: any ideas on my issue?
[07:56:24] <rns> arminrosu, what if I want my forms to display the same text on the button (the value) but submit unique names via posT?
[07:56:31] <Krambfhase> no, the code, looks good
[07:56:45] <arminrosu> rns: use hidden input fields to pass other values
[07:57:02] <arminrosu> Krambfhase: thanks
[07:57:06] <rns> arminrosu, I have two buttons on my form, so.... how can I tell which button was submitted?
[07:57:13] <arminrosu> guess I'll leave it at that
[07:57:25] <thomb> got it :) $('selector').bind('dragstop', function(event,ui){ ... }); does the job
[07:57:56] <arminrosu> rns: if all else fails, catch the submit event, and post an ajax call instead
[07:58:05] <systemfault> arminrosu: The problem is probably on the integration of pixtastic bit I don't know anything about that lib
[07:58:36] <systemfault> s/of/of the
[07:58:39] <arminrosu> systemdefault: thanks. basically it replaces the img element with a canvas
[07:59:10] <arminrosu> but it bugs me I can make it work by calling the plugin differently, i.e. I should be able to modify the plugin in such a way that it works
[08:05:39] <kborchers> arminrosu: not sure but i would look at the way you are passing "this" to apply. i think they are two different things in the two examples. just a guess though ;)
[08:07:37] <arminrosu> kborchers: i suppose, still don't know how to solve it ...
[08:07:43] <arminrosu> sorry, maybe I'm just too tired
[08:08:32] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: AWESOME, appendTo makes IE 7 and 8 sa
[08:08:33] <jeffsmykil> d
[08:08:59] <kborchers> arminrosu: i think in your working example, "this" is a single element, but in the second, "this" is a set of elements so you may need to check for that and react accordingly
[08:09:29] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: hmm, do you have a link or fiddle we can see?
[08:09:37] <jeffsmykil> it might be invalid markup
[08:09:43] <arminrosu> kborchers: isn't that what the first each is for?
[08:09:44] <jeffsmykil> let me check first before i make a fool of myself
[08:09:49] <arminrosu> kborchers: thanks, will try

[08:16:01] <PeterB> Hi, I'd like to improve my JS - is there a neater way to write lines 6 & 7 please? http://pastebin.com/9GrUtZBN
[08:16:30] <PeterB> If the cookie's empty/unset, it's null, but I need empty values set
[08:16:46] <Krambfhase> rosco_y: you are missing qoutes around the "a" on line 18
[08:17:08] <rosco_y> Krambfhase: Thank You!
[08:17:41] <jeffsmykil> PeterB any reason your link locked up my computer :-p
[08:17:59] <PeterB> jeffsmykil: not that I know!
[08:18:10] <jeffsmykil> to be fair only IE
[08:18:32] <Krambfhase> PeterB: i8compare_options = i8compare_options || {};
[08:18:50] <DofLeFou> kborchers: u still there
[08:19:01] <aaronmcadam> yeah PeterB, you don't need to check for null or length
[08:19:09] <DofLeFou> does this jstree plugin do some sorting
[08:19:10] <systemfault> PeterB: Is i8compare_topions an array or an object?
[08:19:11] <kborchers> PeterB: i believe you could just right that as i8compare_options.length ? ...
[08:19:17] <kborchers> DofLeFou: yes
[08:19:22] <systemfault> PeterB: Because it doesn't make any sense.
[08:19:42] <systemfault> PeterB: Objects doesn't have .length
[08:19:55] <systemfault> s/doesn't/don't
[08:20:01] <Krambfhase> if you add a length, they do
[08:20:11] <PeterB> systemfault: an object - eventually it'll be like: { 'path/to/category' : [1,2,3], 'another/path' : [43, 2] }
[08:20:28] <systemfault> PeterB: Then unless you added it, .length is invalid
[08:20:46] <systemfault> ?eval var x = {}; x.length;
[08:20:47] <bot-t> systemfault: undefined
[08:20:48] <Krambfhase> its not invalid, its just undefined
[08:20:52] <PeterB> ok, so I'll use Krambfhase's code
[08:21:00] <PeterB> what about line 7 - any shorter way please?
[08:21:43] <Krambfhase> you could try var current_options = i8compare_options[path] || [];

[08:24:21] <gnarf> but :nth-last-of-type isn't supported by sizzle
[08:24:26] <aaronmcadam> cool
[08:24:27] <gnarf> so no back compat
[08:24:37] <gnarf> just when available via qSA
[08:24:42] <aaronmcadam> ah gotcha
[08:24:44] <aaronmcadam> cool
[08:25:33] <Krambfhase> mediavel times, industrialisation, Age of JQuery
[08:25:58] <systemfault> Until someone creates something better.
[08:26:11] <jeffsmykil> gnarf that makes me sad
[08:26:52] <Fogin[Work]> Intill Jquery evolves to the next level .... "Over 9000"
[08:27:23] <Krambfhase> Next up: jQuery OS for your tablet!
[08:27:25] <jeffsmykil> gnarf can you think help me think of an alternative way to get this:  "#MainContent_TheServiceHistory_ServiceRecordGrid tr:nth-last-of-type(1)"   ?
[08:27:32] <PeterB> Is there a reason delete x[2] leaves the key behind, but sets the value to undefined? Any built-in method to delete the key too?
[08:27:38] <kborchers> ?over 9000 @ Fogin[Work]
[08:27:39] <bot-t> Fogin[Work], http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBtpyeLxVkI
[08:27:39] <Krambfhase> jefflembeck: :eq
[08:27:56] <Krambfhase> ?:eq @ jeffsmykil
[08:27:56] <systemfault> PeterB: For arrays? .splice
[08:27:56] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, :eq(index): Select the element at index n within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[08:28:15] <systemfault> PeterB: You don't seem to understand the difference between an object and an array.
[08:28:32] <PeterB> systemfault: thanks, starting to think arrays may be a bad choice here - I need to add/remove keys or values
[08:28:35] <PeterB> systemfault: in JS I don't
[08:28:42] <jeffsmykil> Krambfhase: then i have to find out how many rows and subtract one etc etc
[08:28:46] <jeffsmykil> but i can do that
[08:28:56] <PeterB> both can be accessed with the same notation...
[08:29:41] <Krambfhase> jeffsmykil: how 'bout $("MainContent_TheServiceHistory_ServiceRecordGrid tr").eq(index) ?
[08:29:51] <systemfault> PeterB: Do you know PHP or some other language?
[08:30:14] <PeterB> systemfault: yes, long-time PHP programmer, also some Python and a few others
[08:30:37] <systemfault> PeterB: Use an object when you want an associative array, and an array in other cases
[08:30:54] <systemfault> PeterB: var array = []; var associativeArray = {};
[08:31:15] <systemfault> (An object isn't actually an associative array but "close enough")
[08:31:38] <bjensen> is there a way I can get around my ajaxSetup? I have a beforesend: showSpinner...I just have one $.ajax where I dont want it shown
[08:31:50] <PeterB> systemfault: thanks - so in this case where I have to add/remove product ID values from an associative array, I'm using an array, but there's no easy wya to find the key associated with a value?
[08:31:59] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: $("#MainContent_TheServiceHistory_ServiceRecordGrid").find("tr").eq(-2) maybe?
[08:32:14] <kborchers> for those having issues with the jQuery UI download earlier, it has been fixed
[08:32:16] <gnarf> i'm not sure what it selects really
[08:32:21] <systemfault> PeterB: To remove an element from an array, use theArray.splice
[08:32:30] <Krambfhase> kborchers: \o/ no more questions about that yay
[08:32:33] <systemfault> PeterB: MDC is a wonderful reference if you need one
[08:32:36] <PeterB> systemfault: like this (no shorter way??) http://pastebin.com/C3rDPrH6
[08:32:48] <systemfault> PeterB: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[08:33:40] <systemfault> PeterB: Watch out for indexOf is you intend to support older browsers
[08:33:43] <jeffsmykil> heh well my first attempt at eq was resounding failure :)
[08:33:57] <jeffsmykil> indexOf bit me once
[08:34:05] <PeterB> systemfault: this needs to work in IE6+... too old?
[08:34:08] <jeffsmykil> i ended up using normal javascripts way
[08:34:20] <jeffsmykil> peterB indexof doesnt work in IE 7
[08:34:21] <systemfault> PeterB: Don't use indexOf then unless you use a shim
[08:34:43] <systemfault> PeterB: jQuery has a function IIRC, can't remember the name
[08:34:58] <PeterB> inArray
[08:35:08] <systemfault> Right
[08:35:12] <jeffsmykil> PeterB I just put the javascript way of doing it and it worked fine
[08:36:47] <kto> hi all
[08:37:10] <kto> Today I learnt that a HTML TD doesn't have a "disabled" attribute, but an input has
[08:37:20] <kto> do you know how I could have a firm solid on such a thing ?
[08:37:36] <kto> I've worked with JS/HTML for a while, but still hate HTML
[08:37:51] <kto> which site/book do you recommend ?
[08:37:58] <jeffsmykil> wait you like JS nit not HTML?
[08:38:27] <kto> I can live with core JS, just not familiar with client JS + HTML
[08:38:54] <jeffsmykil> why would you want to disable a table cell/  i can see the contents of a table cell, but not the cell
[08:38:59] <jeffsmykil> that would throw the whole table off
[08:39:37] <kto> because that table cell contains an input, and a span (span for displaying a table)
[08:39:47] <jeffsmykil> do disable the input
[08:39:50] <jeffsmykil> not the table cell
[08:40:11] <kto> I want to "kill" also the span, that's why I disable the whole table cell
[08:40:31] <jeffsmykil> so disable the table cell and hide the span
[08:40:50] <jeffsmykil> err disable the input and hide the span
[08:40:52] <[gr]ouzo12> Hello! Currently i have 2 scripts .First one ,when #headerwrapper is clicked does some animation.Second one onpageload hides the #maincontent and when a "menu's li" is clicked it appears it again.The problem was that i was getting a page refresh for the second script witch ,right after the content was visible, was hidding content again.I solved this with a "return false" right after before i...
[08:40:54] <[gr]ouzo12> ...close my function inside second script.Why did this work?:D
[08:41:00] <kto> yes, for now it is clear, "disable" means to disallow next entering of values into input
[08:41:12] <kto> and with a span, I only need to hide.
[08:41:29] <kto> But the question is: how can I understand more about HTML, and not hate it
[08:41:29] <jeffsmykil> you can disable an input
[08:41:47] <kto> I can work with C++/Java/JavaScript, but cannot understand HTML
[08:41:55] <versatiletech_> kto: You mean how can you understand browsers and not hate them
[08:42:10] <Krambfhase> browser how do theay work?
[08:42:37] <kto> versatiletech_ : understanding browser is good, but the first step is understanding HTML
[08:42:40] <Fogin[Work]> they work diffrently depending on what one
[08:42:44] <tbranyen> kto: same
[08:42:56] <tbranyen> doing html is right is a pita
[08:43:02] <tbranyen> i can't put ps in spans come on!
[08:43:13] <jeffsmykil> tbranyen: that makes sense
[08:43:20] <jeffsmykil> you cant vertically position in a span
[08:43:33] <tbranyen> you can't?
[08:43:36] <tbranyen> even with line height
[08:43:39] <tbranyen> pretty sure that'll work
[08:43:45] <jeffsmykil> lineheight may be the only way
[08:43:52] <jeffsmykil> padding doesnt work etc
[08:44:07] <kto> jeffsmykil: is there a table somewhere, where all the attributes, properties ... of HTML elements are listed
[08:44:08] <jeffsmykil> i banged my head over that once
[08:44:08] <kto> ??
[08:45:04] <versatiletech> kto: well the HTML in itself is pretty self-explanatory. If you can understand "tags", even XML, and how to markup text in Word, then HTML is easy. It's how browsers render HTML and the quirks between them that's very annoying.
[08:45:13] <[gr]ouzo12> Could som1 explain ,why when i use "return false" before i close a function it prevents page refresh?
[08:45:23] <versatiletech> kto: do you understand XML?
[08:45:40] <jeffsmykil> returnfalse cancels out the default thing a function does iirc
[08:45:45] <jeffsmykil> so like a click or something
[08:46:55] <kto> versatiletech: XML is all about tags and attribute
[08:47:04] <kto> that's not a problem for me
[08:47:17] <[gr]ouzo12> I m still not getting it :/.I got it working here http://pastebin.com/nwq0wjJJ but i cant understand why it did what i needed
[08:47:33] <nail_> kto: This will only give you an exhaustive list of html elements with their meaning, nothing related to events or anything else, but that gives a good picture: http://joshduck.com/periodic-table.html
[08:47:43] <nail_> html5
[08:48:29] <ajpiano> [gr]ouzo12, when you do "return false" inside a jquery handler, it calls event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation(), so the default action is canceled and no elements above the element that was click ever get a chance to handle the click because of the propagation being stopped
[08:48:35] <nail_> and that links to the reference
[08:49:27] <kto> nail_: very nice, although somebody here told me that I should not listen to what W3Schools teach
[08:49:32] <versatiletech> kto: HTML is all about tags and attributes as well
[08:49:54] <Krambfhase> kto: http://w3fools.com/
[08:50:45] <kto> Krambfhase: excellent
[08:50:59] <[gr]ouzo12> Thank you ajpiano!
[08:51:05] <ajpiano> welx
[08:51:13] <jeffsmykil> whats the percentage of bad info on w3schools though?  I mean i still use wikipedia
[08:51:21] <jeffsmykil> i dont take it as gospel
[08:51:23] <kto> versatiletech: then maybe my claim that XML doesn't cause a problem for me, is wrong
[08:51:25] <jeffsmykil> but i use it
[08:51:29] <DofLeFou> I have the following http://jsfiddle.net/fV8XF
[08:51:59] <DofLeFou> i m trying to figure to figure how to sort <li> ..</li>
[08:52:00] <systemfault> XML is a pita :/
[08:52:59] <versatiletech> kto: both HTML and XML are derived from SGML so they are similar but are used for different purposes
[08:53:12] <atxq> how can call a function when the enter key is pressed on a textarea?
[08:53:28] <jeffsmykil> keyup?
[08:53:42] <jeffsmykil> http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[08:53:44] <innociv> What's a shorter way of saying "Yesterday?" Lmao.
[08:53:46] <atxq> I was using .keypress with jquery, but not working now
[08:53:53] <Krambfhase> T+1
[08:54:07] <jeffsmykil> Monday!
[08:54:11] <jeffsmykil> what do I win?
[08:55:38] <kto> versatiletech: I knew that fact. But maybe why XML didn't cause me problems is that I only use XML to wrap data between tags, and while using I just reach to that tag. With HTML I have to satisfy the browser with alot of attributes
[08:56:40] <kto> Krambfhase: in general, how many percent of info on w3schools are not good ?
[08:56:50] <darcyclarke> DofLeFou http://www.onemoretake.com/2009/02/25/sorting-elements-with-jquery/
[08:56:51] <bot-t> (41 hours 10 mins ago) <danheberden> tell darcyclarke omg you're a year older today! happppy bday :D
[08:57:19] <Krambfhase> kto: dunno. i dont read that crap.
[08:57:57] <kto> Krambfase: the seniors in HTML in my company use w3schools, I thought that w3schools is OK
[08:58:13] <versatiletech> kto: yep, that's why HTML isn't the hard part. It's satisfying the browser that is the hard part.
[08:58:17] <arminrosu> any idea why these two would have the same result
[08:58:22] <arminrosu> return this.each( function() {			
[08:58:22] <arminrosu> 				Pixastic.process( this , options.effect, options.settings );
[08:58:22] <arminrosu> 			});
[08:58:27] <arminrosu> return Pixastic.process( this[0] , options.effect, options.settings );
[08:58:38] <Krambfhase> please do not paste your code into the chat.
[08:58:54] <arminrosu> sorry, didn't think it warranted a pastebin ...
[08:58:54] <kto> versatiletech: I see your point. Excellent
[09:00:39] <versatiletech> kto: how much of CSS have you learned?
[09:01:00] <kto> almost none
[09:01:10] <versatiletech> k
[09:01:53] <kto> only have a rough idea that CSS helps to manipulate HTML elements intermixingly (that's why "cascaded")
[09:02:43] <versatiletech> kto: I strongly recommend this book http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Mastery-Advanced-Standards-Solutions/dp/1590596145/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1309276920&sr=1-5
[09:03:10] <Krambfhase> I thought the C in CSS stood for crazy ?
[09:03:38] <innociv> :)
[09:03:39] <systemfault> Krambfhase: Yes, indeed.
[09:03:49] <kto> Krambfhase: Douglas Crockford call CSS stupid
[09:03:54] <systemfault> Crazy Stupid Sheet
[09:03:57] <innociv> CSS is great except for it not being standardized.
[09:03:59] <catshirt> lol ^^
[09:04:14] <catshirt> at systemfault of course
[09:04:16] <systemfault> When I angry, I replace the ee with a i
[09:04:20] <kto> but, as a innocent user, I don't say anything against it
[09:04:31] <systemfault> *I'm
[09:04:33] <catshirt> i agree w innociv, i like css... ive also been accused of suffering stockholm syndrome for it though
[09:04:42] <innociv> Lol
[09:04:44] <sadmicrowave> alright, time to take a break from work
[09:05:12] <systemfault> catshirt: I think that I suffer from it too.. for JS
[09:05:13] <Krambfhase> css is crap except for its selectors. But most ppl dont understand how the work. So it sucks.
[09:05:16] <versatiletech> after 1 year of frustration with CSS and 2 years of not touching it at all, this book helped me understand how CSS is rendered in browsers and the quirks between them. Now I saw that there was a newer version, but I haven't read it so I'm not in the position to recommend it.
[09:05:49] <innociv> CSS does what it's supposed to... It replaces attributes in a much cleaner and more powerful way, and a way that caches like javascript does.  It shouldn't do more than that, as that's javascripts realm.  It's just you get a lot of issues with CSS that come from it not working the same across browsers.
[09:05:56] <innociv> The only real gripe i have with css is height 100%
[09:06:10] <innociv> and it not having been border-box from the begining
[09:06:17] <kto> versatiletech: which book helps you understand CSS ?
[09:06:35] <systemfault> And using middle at one place.. and center at another..
[09:06:49] <versatiletech> kto: http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Mastery-Advanced-Standards-Solutions/dp/1590596145/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1309276920&sr=1-5
[09:06:49] <systemfault> The box model is indeed totally _retarded_
[09:07:08] <kto> for me, the whole HTML/CSS/XML is unnecessarily complicated, and I used to hate it. But now, I have to learn to live with that.
[09:07:11] <sadmicrowave> I just found a CSS book I had on my bookshelf published in 1997 lol
[09:07:31] <sadmicrowave> was I even alive then..?
[09:07:46] <systemfault> HTML is fairly easy, CSS has a lot of catches.. XML is avoidable.
[09:10:51] <jeffsmykil> I hate bugzilla
[09:10:52] <versatiletech> kto: yep, that's the life of a developer knowing that we have to deal with certain technologies. Some are definitely clunky, but we simply don't have another choice. We just have to work with what we have and hope for the best.
[09:11:35] <innociv> I also have a big gripe with CSS3
[09:11:51] <innociv> In thati t's being standardized one property at a time instead of getting a full spec done before browsers adopt it.
[09:12:12] <innociv> Like look at box-shadow.  Seems alright.. but it's missing one major thing just like how it was missing inset before being standardized
[09:12:20] <innociv> You can't change the shadow size.  You can change the feathering, but not the size.
[09:12:32] <jeffsmykil> wow we are using version 2.2
[09:13:23] <innociv> So like if you want a smaller shadow just coming out the bottom of a box, you can't cut in the shadow and move it down.  You can just move it down, which still has it out the sides.  Even more useful would be making it larger with an inset so the shadow is only on one side.
[09:13:54] <innociv> So you'd have to use gradient for the latter effect, and all the different gradient properties there are drafts for are lacking.  Chromes I guess is best so far.
[09:13:55] <paul_irish> you know there's the size attribute in addition to spread, right?
[09:14:14] <innociv> .. There is? I've never seen it. There is a 4th value?
[09:14:23] <paul_irish> mmhmm
[09:14:30] <paul_irish> should be documented on mdc
[09:15:06] <innociv> You're right there is a spread.  Never seen that up until now.
[09:15:20] <innociv> I like to think it wasn't there before though. :x
[09:15:32] <paul_irish> sure. let's go with that :)
[09:16:29] <innociv> I can make these buttons sexier now.  Woo.  I'm positive I've never seen the spread used.  Guess  I should have checked mdc instead of just goggle results.
[09:17:23] <innociv> Yeah it wasn't there back in Firefox 3.5 and it's still not in chrome 10 unless you -webkit.  So it just became standard, Paul.
[09:17:28] <innociv> Good thing, though.
[09:18:46] <innociv> I hope gradient shapes up better.  Mozilla's doesn't let you set pixel key points, only percents, and Chrome's writers all ugly like a ms filter.
[09:18:58] <Caraes_Naur> is there a demo somewhere of how to restrict ui.resizable to a specific width x height result?
[09:19:33] <paul_irish> innociv: webkit's gradients have matched ff's since december
[09:19:35] <innociv> there is maxWidth property or something
[09:20:01] <innociv> Eh?  background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(left center, #fff 0%, #fad6b0 15%);  background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, 175 top, from(#fff), to(#fad6b0));
[09:20:46] <paul_irish> -webkit-linear-gradient bro
[09:21:01] <paul_irish> css3please gives you the story
[09:21:08] <versatiletech> innociv: I think the problem is with the people involved in the spec. It's like politics with debates. Most times it takes a long time to agree on something. Supposed the HTML5 spec will be done by 2014. Even with that done it'll take years before browsers implement everything on the spec and even more years for everyone to adopt these new browsers. So we're probably looking at least 10, 15 years of dealing with browser issues. That means I'll hav
[09:21:08] <versatiletech> job in the meantime.
[09:21:09] <Caraes_Naur> I'm setting up the layout for a calendar year, so using grid I want to restrict my final values to factors of 12
[09:21:13] <paul_irish> also webkit blog got a post detailing the changes in syntax
[09:21:28] <jeffsmykil> Man this version of bugzilla is from 2006
[09:21:28] <innociv> Ah, actually -moz does set pixel width.  Just chrome has no px and moz does, which is also odd.
[09:21:31] <innociv> Alright I'll take a look
[09:23:59] <innociv> Yeah it looks like -moz-linear-gradient(left center, #fff 0, #ffecc0 175px); and -webkit just the same works now.  I personally like that syntax.  Some other websites are just behind.
[09:25:47] <jeffsmykil> innociv: IE isn't even going to support that, you have to use SVG?
[09:26:02] <innociv> progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient ;/
[09:26:09] <jeffsmykil> no way
[09:26:12] <jeffsmykil> so many performance issues
[09:26:14] <jeffsmykil> not worth it
[09:26:20] <innociv> Haha.  Or just use an image
[09:26:32] <innociv> No http request if it gets overwritten.
[09:26:59] <jeffsmykil> it really is terrible
[09:27:03] <jeffsmykil> kills scrolling
[09:27:16] <innociv> I'll have to try it on a slow computer..
[09:27:32] <jeffsmykil> um
[09:27:37] <innociv> Errr this linear gradient isn't in fact working the same
[09:27:38] <jeffsmykil> I have an 8 core machine
[09:27:38] <qvarkk> i get passed obj "slide" to a function. when i try to output that object (img) using $(slide) i get [object Object] as result.
[09:27:46] <qvarkk> $(slide).html() returns nothing
[09:27:48] <innociv> I have an E6750 and IE doesn't lag me...
[09:27:48] <jeffsmykil> with a 1gb graphics card
[09:27:51] <jeffsmykil> not the computer

[09:30:49] <blindMoe> mikeycgto: nice
[09:31:19] <mikeycgto> :)
[09:31:31] <jotmaster> yep, but it's not my fault :P and I've to deal with him until IE6 dissapear :P hahaha
[09:31:51] <qvarkk> kborchers Krambfhase i see that it's a correct object, but how can i fetch the values inside?
[09:31:54] <notjrbauer> I'm doing a store locator, and if they share location, I get the area then I submit. Since this is on load, the page keeps refreshing. Is there a way around this?
[09:32:05] <kborchers> ?val @ qvarkk
[09:32:05] <bot-t> qvarkk, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[09:32:10] <qvarkk> it's a image with for example: alt, attributes etc-
[09:32:37] <kborchers> ?attr @ qvarkk
[09:32:38] <bot-t> qvarkk, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[09:33:28] <jotmaster> well, the problem consist in this: if I have "<a href="/testing.php">Test</a>" in the body and I try to get the href value by $('a').attr('href'); I got "/testing.php" but if I do this --> $j('body').append('<a href="/testing.php">Test</a>'); and try to get the href value gives me the absolute path (http://localhost/testing.php), anyone have a fix?
[09:33:38] <jotmaster> sorry for my bad english :P
[09:33:39] <Krambfhase> ?preventDefault @ notjrbauer
[09:33:40] <bot-t> notjrbauer, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:34:02] <screen-x> $('.add-another').each(function(i,o){o}) and $('.add-another').each(function(i,o){$(o).parent()}) return the same thing, why?
[09:34:38] <Wiz-KeeD> if i call .change() on an object it only triggers after i lose focus of the input field, how can i do this live as i type?
[09:34:55] <necromancer> Wiz-KeeD: .keyup() is what i use normally
[09:34:59] <kborchers> ?keyup @ Wiz-KeeD
[09:35:00] <bot-t> Wiz-KeeD, .keyup(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[09:35:02] <necromancer> it activates when a key press has completed
[09:35:13] <Krambfhase> screen-x: you might want to do .map() instead of .eaach()
[09:35:13] <jotmaster> live('input') will fix I think Wiz-KeeD
[09:35:24] <screen-x> Krambfhase: whats the difference?
[09:35:33] <jotmaster> .live('input', function () { doSomething(); });
[09:35:35] <Wiz-KeeD> keyup, le me try
[09:36:12] <gnarf> input?
[09:36:15] <kborchers> jotmaster: no
[09:36:17] <gnarf> thats not an event
[09:36:21] <gnarf> ?fail
[09:36:21] <bot-t> ((![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]])
[09:36:21] <Krambfhase> .each() simply executes a function for each element and then returns the collection again. .map() returns a new array based on the collection
[09:36:40] <kborchers> gnarf :D
[09:36:50] <gnarf> ?js ((![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]])
[09:36:50] <screen-x> Krambfhase: I'm using .each() as I wan't to iterate of the result set from $(). however I can't get jquery functions to work inside each()
[09:36:50] <bot-t> gnarf: "fail"
[09:37:30] <Wiz-KeeD> thank a lot necromancer !
[09:37:31] <kborchers> ?demo @ screen-x
[09:37:31] <bot-t> screen-x, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:37:32] <Wiz-KeeD> it works
[09:37:51] * screen-x prepares demo

[09:37:58] <kto> this channel is great. You guys know much better than people in my company. It seems that everything in IT happens in the US
[09:38:01] <gnarf> ^.^
[09:38:11] <gnarf> kto: jQuery is globalz
[09:38:16] <gnarf> :)
[09:38:52] <jotmaster> kborchers: sure?
[09:38:54] <mecode> If i want to have some elements (or associated hidden input elements, i don't care which) store either "true" or "false" (boolean), what's the best way? I don't want to test a string - that feels weird. Should I just do that? or any better ideas?
[09:38:56] <Krambfhase> kto: if "everything in IT happens in the US" was a true statement chrome would still be slow today
[09:39:20] <kborchers> jotmaster: input is not an event
[09:39:27] <gnarf> mecode: you just need to store the value, or do you need it passed to a form?
[09:39:34] <jotmaster> no about that :P about my problem
[09:39:47] <ajpiano> input is a new event but there's no support for it in jquery
[09:40:09] <kto> Krambfhase: which group of users contribute much to chrome speed ?
[09:40:19] <Krambfhase> v8 is developed in denmark
[09:40:25] <jotmaster> I use input, and I've seen that twitter use too :P
[09:40:43] <paul_irish> aarhus!
[09:40:43] <mecode> gnarf: i'm generating the html dynamically for a quiz. each question should have the answer (true or false) stored in the html so that jquery can immediately mark if they got the answer correctly or not. don't worry - it's not a real quiz, so it doesn't matter that the answers are "exposed"
[09:40:52] <kto> oh, I would read about that. Now my statement is "98% of every IT things happen in US"
[09:40:58] <paul_irish> ...
[09:41:05] <Krambfhase> m(
[09:41:06] <paul_irish> linux wasnt created in the US
[09:41:09] <kborchers> jotmaster: $j('body').append doesn't look right, is that a mistake here or in your code. j?
[09:41:28] <paul_irish> most of the standardization shit like ISO and IETF happens outside US
[09:41:33] <gnarf> mecode: <div data-correct="true">
[09:41:43] <paul_irish> kto: in general, you're quite wrong :)
[09:41:54] <gnarf> $("div").data("correct") == "true"
[09:42:15] <paul_irish> and that's a good thing
[09:42:30] <jotmaster> sorry, copy & paste, I'm using prototype too and I've var $j = jQuery.noConflict(); :P, so that will be $('body').append
[09:42:32] <kto> paul_irish: prove that I'm wrong :)
[09:42:41] <paul_irish> JUST DID
[09:42:41] <jotmaster> kborchers: sorry, copy & paste, I'm using prototype too and I've var $j = jQuery.noConflict(); :P, so that will be $('body').append
[09:43:31] <screen-x> http://jsfiddle.net/27pNN/ ok here's my demo, works fine on jsfiddle, but paste the same into the chrome javascript console and it doesn't work. - All the A elements are returned as an array
[09:43:43] <Krambfhase> kto: K-Computer, ARM, SAP, Z3, CCC what more examples do you need?
[09:43:57] <kborchers> jotmaster: input is not an event so you did not use that in live the way you described. also, don't recommend live() when bind() will do. as for your issue, not sure. see ?demo
[09:43:57] <bot-t> jotmaster, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:44:15] <kto> all of them I don't know, except SAP, to be honest
[09:44:22] <hiryu> hello
[09:44:52] <Krambfhase> screen-x: jquery object show up as arrays of elements in the chrome console afaik
[09:45:20] <gnarf> cuz they are
[09:45:23] <screen-x> Krambfhase: yah, but its the wrong objects.. its the 'a' elements, not the parents of them as requested..
[09:45:34] <kborchers> screen-x: if it works in the fiddle, then something else is wrong. you need to replicate the issue for us to see and help you. you may even fix it yourself in the process. ;)
[09:45:40] <gnarf> screen-x: its the return value of the chain probably
[09:45:51] <gnarf> screen-x: i dunno
[09:45:52] <screen-x> ok :)
[09:46:06] <a_L_p> Hello, I have a table with duplicate rows and I am trying to hide the duplicates. My thought was if I can get a selector set with all of the duplicates I can programmatically hide the ones that I don't want... I have this to select all of the rows: $('td:contains("U.S.P.S. Priority Mail")').parent(); How can I select specific items from that set?
[09:46:23] <Krambfhase> screen-x: http://jsfiddle.net/27pNN/1/
[09:46:36] <gnarf> a_L_p: much better handled on the server
[09:47:08] <gnarf> a_L_p: as to the question "How can I select specific items from that set?" -- Why don't you tell me how you would find them?
[09:47:49] <a_L_p> gnarf: I would like to select the :first or :last depending on the case
[09:47:57] <kto> Krambfhase: is ARM created by a German guy ?
[09:48:13] <Krambfhase> no, ARM is british
[09:48:21] <kto> found that:)
[09:48:55] <kto> Krambfhase: OK, i saw some Japanese, German, British, Dannish here. But they count for < 5% of the IT things :)
[09:50:07] <niftylettuce> Katz got your tongue?
[09:50:38] <kto> w3fools is great. It points me to many great URL
[09:51:01] <Decavolt> How can I pass a variable to a variable function? In this case I need to pass an element ID to myLoop, but this doesn't work:  myLoop = setInterval(function(myvar){
[09:52:05] <kto> Decavolt: can you paste more of your code here (in one line, if possible)
[09:52:53] <StimpyDash> Hiya guys :)
[09:53:14] <kto> hi
[09:54:07] <Krambfhase> nationalism is like religion. opium of the people.
[09:54:28] <Decavolt> kto here's a stripped down version: $('.portrait').hover(function() {	var $theparent = $(this);	infiniteLoop = setInterval(function(parentID){ [do stuff] }) });
[09:55:00] <Decavolt> kto actually, that should be: $('.portrait').hover(function() {	var $theparent = $(this);	infiniteLoop = setInterval(function($theparent){ [do stuff] }) });
[09:55:36] <g0bl1n> is there any way one can make a request to another URI ? Need to call another service, on another port to get a JSON result.
[09:55:56] <Krambfhase> ?p @ Decavolt
[09:55:57] <bot-t> Decavolt, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:56:31] <Decavolt> Usually I would Krambfhase, but kto had asked for it here instead. My apologies.
[09:57:10] <larzen-wrk> Any reason why this is returning "may" for  current date? http://jsfiddle.net/wEYUT/3/
[09:57:17] <Krambfhase> bty, by doing function($theparent) you declare a new parameter with that name so you can no longer access teh variable!
[09:57:24] <larzen-wrk> i hav a short example of me updating an input box with the current date
[09:57:33] <Null_> any able to help me find out why this page works in chrome/ff but not in IE? http://hansandholly.ca/test/#/pages/listing.php?mls=E2131504  I assumed originally IE didn't like the get parameters (as other pages from the site load fine in IE), but I am now passing the variables via post and it still isn't working...
[09:57:47] <Decavolt> Owch, I wasn't aware of that. Thanks Krambfhase
[09:58:37] <Krambfhase> larzen-wrk: its zero indexed!
[09:58:58] <larzen-wrk> Krambfhase: I don't follow... ?

[10:00:12] <StimpyDash> I was wondering if you can use jquery to interact with elements that have just been created. I'm having a bit of trouble with an accordion script I'm making. http://jsfiddle.net/Pv5hv/
[10:00:12] <Krambfhase> err, no i think not
[10:00:23] <jotmaster> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/hy47K/ here is a demo, but u have to run it in IE6 :P
[10:00:30] <StimpyDash> I've checked it so I'm pretty sure I haven't done anything stupid O.o
[10:00:38] <kto> Decavolt, sorry
[10:00:40] <hiryu> how i do for get all options of a jquery slider?
[10:00:45] <Krambfhase> StimpyDash: curTime.getMonth()
[10:00:45] <Decavolt> kto: np :)
[10:00:51] <g0bl1n> trying a proxy server to avoid cross domain requests
[10:01:03] <Krambfhase> StimpyDash: read this: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[10:01:25] <Krambfhase> g0bl1n: try JSONp
[10:02:04] <StimpyDash> Whoa, long explanation. bblater :)
[10:02:18] <larzen-wrk>  Krambfhase -- so how do I add 1 to m.getMonth() ?
[10:02:59] <Krambfhase> +1
[10:03:23] <larzen-wrk> ah! easy
[10:04:50] <g0bl1n> Krambfhase, yes, thanks
[10:08:42] <[gr]ouzo12> Header animates down.On menu li click content appears and logo moves out of the way.If i dont prevent page refresh content will disapear imediately.If prevented content area never changes ,no matter what menuitem you choose.http://pastebin.com/gsVXU0JY Any ideas?
[10:08:43] <bamccaig> I have a case where jQuery(undefined) or jQuery() seems to never return.
[10:09:36] <bamccaig> Is that expected behavior or is something very very wrong? :\
[10:10:11] <bamccaig> It seems to work from Firebug console. :\ If I put alert("Before...") and alert("...After") surrounding the call though it never alerts "...After".
[10:10:21] <kborchers> jotmaster: if you do it this way it works. an extra step but fixes the issue. http://jsfiddle.net/hy47K/2/
[10:14:01] <Decavolt> OK, here's a clarification of what I'm trying to do http://pastebin.com/9YPTL7kD
[10:14:35] <jotmaster> kborchers: thanks for the support and yes, that fix the error, but I'm getting data from ajax request and delivering it on a container, this data has <a> tags
[10:17:58] <bakers> I have a table with a date field, and an ID field. I want to delete old entries, if a given ID has more than 50 entries
[10:18:22] <bakers> Can I do it one query? I could find the date field of the 50th entry, and then delete anything > $datefield?
[10:19:43] <kborchers> jotmaster: this is a known issue. see http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7117 and then http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2 and scroll down just before examples
[10:19:55] <geekbuntu> bakers,  what are you trying to do with this script
[10:20:09] <rosco_y> Newbie Question: Why is my $("a").click(function()) not working?  : http://paste2.org/p/1493502
[10:20:12] <geekbuntu> bakers, if it worked perfectly - what would happen/when?
[10:20:19] <geekbuntu> bakers, what doesn't work now?
[10:21:19] <bakers> I'm storing data for an event in my table. I only want to store the most recent 50 events for a given ID. How do I delete any entries beyond the most recent 50.
[10:21:22] <djQuery> morning
[10:21:23] <bot-t> (2 hours 8 mins 10 secs ago) <gnarf> tell djQuery sure - its like 70 hours later... but -- ?newContent (the live query binding thing)
[10:21:54] <djQuery> ?newContent
[10:21:54] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[10:21:56] <bakers> Can I use an offset with DELETE?
[10:21:57] <bamccaig> rosco_y: Looks OK to me.
[10:22:11] <Krambfhase> fuck, my firefox died
[10:22:15] <bakers> Oh wait! Wrong channel, sorry!
[10:22:20] <rosco_y> bamccaig: :( when I click on the "Link", nothing happens.....
[10:22:31] <rosco_y> (thank you, by the way....)
[10:22:37] <geekbuntu> bakers, if it's php?
[10:22:45] <geekbuntu> bakers, just add limit 50 on your query
[10:22:46] <bakers> geekbuntu: I thought I was in #mysql sorry
[10:22:54] <geekbuntu> bakers, LIMIT 50
[10:23:37] <Null_> any able to help me find out why this page works in chrome/ff but not in IE? http://hansandholly.ca/test/#/pages/listing.php?mls=E2131504  I assumed originally IE didn't like the get parameters (as other pages from the site load fine in IE), but I am now passing the variables via post and it still isn't working...I can't easily test/debug in IE atm.

[10:24:04] <geekbuntu> oh... nvm - too late
[10:24:09] <geekbuntu> it hink
[10:24:10] <geekbuntu> i think
[10:24:11] <geekbuntu>  lol
[10:25:38] <djQuery> thanks gnarf going to be putting together some .tmpl examples that use this to apply stuff
[10:25:49] <BMCouto> Hi, how can I queue different animations on different elements?
[10:26:24] <rosco_y> geekbuntu: Thanks :))  I learned a lot about jsFiddle too--I was pasting everying in the HTML field (doh)....
[10:26:35] <geekbuntu> rosco_y, jsfiddle speeds things up
[10:26:35] <djQuery> rosco_y: you might want this in addition. http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/4UL9p/1/
[10:27:04] <geekbuntu> djQuery, are you putting a plugin together?  i'll help with tmpl's if you need help
[10:27:15] <screen-x> thanks all for your help :)
[10:27:18] <rosco_y> Hmm....wonder why it doesn't work when I run it locally.....oh well, moving on....
[10:27:22] <kborchers> Null_: It looks find in IE9. My guess would be that you are spitting a bunch of stuff out to the console and if you don't have the developer tools in IE, I think it chokes on console.log. i could be wrong though
[10:27:32] <Krambfhase> Capitalism 1:0 Communism. Take that north korea!
[10:27:39] <rosco_y> Yes, Thanks geekbuntu, bamccaig ET. AL....
[10:27:49] <geekbuntu> rosco_y, yw
[10:27:53] <djQuery> geekbuntu: I am stuck like chuck. http://jsbin.com/uxenub/23/edit
[10:28:07] <Null_> kborchers: very interesting, ok thanks, will have a look at that possibility. Glad to hear it at least works in IE9.
[10:28:13] <jotmaster> kborchers: so isn't fix?
[10:28:31] <geekbuntu> djQuery, any clue on where it's stuck?
[10:28:49] <djQuery> notice that nowhere does it actualy put the data in. you can tell that it is parsing it becase the right amount of table widgets and tr's are created.
[10:28:50] <kborchers> jotmaster: no, it is an issue with IE so the fix was just updating the documentation. sorry.
[10:29:06] <rosco_y> djQuery: you were expecting data, obviously?
[10:29:44] <djQuery> rosco_y: geekbuntu: yes I thought I had done it just like he did it here http://borismoore.github.com/jsviews/demos/step-by-step/04_editable-data.html
[10:30:07] <geekbuntu> djQuery, the table part is a new twist for me
[10:30:26] <rosco_y> djQuery: where would the table data be coming from?
[10:30:35] <djQuery> geekbuntu: yeah I wanted to display more infro about the collumn by default
[10:30:54] <jotmaster> kborchers: fuck :P xD well, so... I'm trying to simulate BigPipe of FB :P do u have any idea how?
[10:31:00] <geekbuntu> djQuery, look@roscoe's question
[10:31:08] <geekbuntu> i do not see any data to parse
[10:31:15] <djQuery> rosco_y: the data is made down around here scheme = [new Scheme("Testing", "Testing Schema", [
[10:31:16] <geekbuntu> i see column headers
[10:31:23] <geekbuntu> oh
[10:31:24] <geekbuntu> ok
[10:31:44] <rosco_y> ah
[10:31:50] <rosco_y> ic
[10:32:00] <geekbuntu> i was looking for a stack of stuff/json or something
[10:32:32] <rosco_y> Well, I sure have a lot to learn about jQuery before I'll be anything more than a hindrance....
[10:32:35] <kborchers> jotmaster: don't support ie6 ;)
[10:32:58] <djQuery> kborchers: http://saveie6.com
[10:33:28] <rosco_y> I wish we'd eventually hit a platform where they gave you the "Now You Know It All" award, so we wouldn't have to keep learning new stuff....
[10:33:32] <kborchers> djQuery: i just threw up a little in my mouth
[10:33:37] <geekbuntu> {{tmpl(Columns()), "#coltmpl"}}
[10:33:43] <rosco_y> kborchers: Nummy...
[10:33:51] <geekbuntu> djQuery, i'm checking to see if that is the problem (no comma)
[10:34:00] <djQuery> kborchers: go through the download link its funny
[10:34:20] <djQuery> geekbuntu: he has no commas in his example
[10:34:21] <jotmaster> kborchers: I'm trying to load pagelets using #! like GMail, Facebook and Twitter... I'd succeed until I found this bug on IE6, do u know any framework or way to do that?
[10:34:41] <geekbuntu> nor in mine
[10:35:54] <kborchers> djQuery: can't believe I haven't seen that. hilarious! XD
[10:36:00] <BMCouto> Hi, how can I queue different animations on different elements?

[10:44:45] <kborchers> tucan: the value will be put in the box by autocomplete so just submit your form. that should do it
[10:44:55] <hiryu> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3803 i don't understand where i put .bind()
[10:45:27] <geekbuntu> djQuery, have you tried your paste without all the overhead of the views.js/etc?  just the basic model working first?
[10:45:39] <geekbuntu> djQuery, there's a ton of luggage to look through
[10:45:49] <djQuery> geekbuntu: yes using regular .tmpl it works
[10:46:02] <geekbuntu> djQuery, ah
[10:46:50] <geekbuntu> djQuery, (i'm not picking on you - you've dug me out more times than i count), but did you add scripts back in one at a time?
[10:46:58] <shankysv87> hey there. i'm trying to use a simple command that on page load, it loads a hidden div on the same page to show as the page by default.  Then on click of a button, it will replace that with another hidden div again within the same page. any thoughts.
[10:47:01] <geekbuntu> look for fail point
[10:47:26] <djQuery> geekbuntu: no they all rely on each other so you gotta add them all at once.
[10:47:39] <shankysv87> seems like when i use $("#loadedpage").load(#home_div"); its wanting to load the entire site again within the div causing problems.
[10:48:46] <KWhat_Work> Every time I apply ui-state-hover I basically get extra padding or something like that is causing the text in the element I apply it to to basically shift.  What is the correct base to apply ui-state-hover to so i dont get that shift?
[10:48:52] <djQuery> shankysv87: $('#loadedpage').load('url #selectorofwhatuwant', function(){callback here});
[10:49:17] <geekbuntu> djQuery, did everything work on his lesser examples?
[10:49:40] <geekbuntu> djQuery, i ask because i get script errors but ti's not from your code
[10:50:47] <djQuery> geekbuntu: I get lotsa script errors when editing. open the console and clear it. then uncheck realtime preview then put it back and u will see that there are no errors when it is actualy running
[10:51:12] <geekbuntu> djQuery, i didn't know he had updated his demo's so extensively
[10:51:53] <jbrokc> is there a way to tell whether a key has been held down (not pressed)?
[10:51:59] <geekbuntu> djQuery, i'll play with it some - see if i can figure it out/learn... ben nadel has an (what is now 'old') example of javascript mvc - i was looking at it, and this almost looks like it is modeled after nadel's version
[10:52:10] <jbrokc> like an event that fires after it's been continually pressed for a set amount of time (or multiple times in a row)?
[10:52:53] <djQuery> jbrokc: set a time on key down then compare that to the time on key up?
[10:52:57] <geekbuntu> jbrokc, http://www.jquery4u.com/tag/jquery-keyboard-shortcuts/
[10:53:31] <jbrokc> djQuery: well, the bug is happening when the key is held down (which simulates it being pressed many times over and over)
[10:53:44] <geekbuntu> http://www.jquery4u.com/events/capture-single-key-press/  for single key
[10:55:08] <tucan> nice
[10:57:10] * ch3mical waves
[10:58:07] <StimpyDash> Erm would you recommend any book? I'm using jquery novice to ninja atm
[10:58:08] <rickomax> does somebody here knows why it dosen't work at IExplorer? http://jsfiddle.net/KbxbL/
[11:01:22] <necromancer> geekbuntu: there needs to be a plugin that helps abstract that
[11:01:42] <necromancer> $.shortcut.bind('a', 'click', function() {});
[11:01:57] <necromancer> err wait haha
[11:02:01] <shankysv87> djQuery: for the .load() api, how would i address the "url" part if its within the same document?
[11:02:07] <necromancer> just $.shortcut.bind('a', function() {...});
[11:02:55] <necromancer> rickomax: try using jsonp
[11:03:02] <necromancer> not sure how the gdata api works
[11:03:20] <necromancer> but jsonp is normally used for cross-server communication, so same-origin policy doesn't take effect
[11:03:21] <necromancer> `sop
[11:03:23] <shankysv87> djQuery: and its what loads on first page load
[11:03:23] <necromancer> ?sop
[11:03:24] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[11:03:26] <necromancer> there ya go
[11:04:02] <rickomax> so necromancer, may I need the jsonp plugin for jquery?
[11:04:31] <necromancer> rickomax: look up $.ajax again, 'jsonp' is a dataType and returns an object from JSON, but accomplishes it in a different way
[11:04:45] <necromancer> ?ajax
[11:04:46] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:04:53] <necromancer> actually wait
[11:04:54] <necromancer> ?jsonp
[11:04:55] <bot-t> JSONP, Quickly Â« plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[11:04:57] <necromancer> there ya go :)
[11:05:03] <necromancer> rickomax: ^^
[11:05:58] <rickomax> thanks necromancer I gonna take a look
[11:07:49] <necromancer> rickomax: note that the syntax described on http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ is a bit out of date. always consult the jQuery docs for syntax
[11:09:33] <tucan> for some reason, my script is breaking with jquery ui autocomplete when i am not on the homepage
[11:09:46] <thomb> does someone know, how i can run through an array inside a json object? http://jsfiddle.net/Yju5v/
[11:10:01] <shankysv87> i'm trying to load a hidden div context into a page on load of the page.  the hidden div is within the same document. should the cyntax be: $("#container").load("#hidden_div");   ?
[11:10:52] <shankysv87> or moreso the hidden div is containing the div i want to actually load, among other divs that i potentially want to show if the correct buttons are pressed.
[11:11:09] <thomb> shaknysv87 try $(document).ready(function()
[11:11:09] <thomb> {
[11:11:09] <thomb> 	$("#container").html($("#hidden_div".html());
[11:11:09] <thomb> });
[11:11:11] <djQuery> well I am about to give up on this anyone elese got a javascript templating that allows databinding
[11:11:31] <djQuery> ?demo@thomb
[11:11:32] <bot-t> thomb, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:12:00] <shankysv87> thomb: would it make a difference that the stuff that is contained within that div is a php script?
[11:12:06] <thomb> djquery, bot-t okay i'll change it
[11:12:39] <thomb> shankysv87: you should use ajax to load data afterwards from a script
[11:12:59] <shankysv87> yeah, thats what i was thinking ( i think)
[11:13:52] <djQuery> $('#hiddendiv').load(function(){ $('#visiblediv').html($(this).html();  })
[11:14:36] <djQuery> dont think this will realy work except for images though
[11:14:40] <[gr]ouzo12> if/else  statement syntax according to .hasClass true/false value?
[11:15:26] <thomb> http://jsfiddle.net/Yju5v/1/ i would like to iterate over all elements of json_obj.dropable
[11:15:40] <djQuery> anyone know of a good client side templating plugin with data binding
[11:16:00] <Fogin[Work]> [gr]ouzo12 if($('#bob').hasclass){ ... } should do that
[11:16:11] <rickomax> hey necromancer, thanks for the example x)
[11:16:12] <[gr]ouzo12> Thanks
[11:16:20] <rickomax> necromancer: it now works at ie8+
[11:16:34] <necromancer> np
[11:16:39] <rickomax> necromancer: still dosen't work at ie7, but I we can't make miracles...hehe
[11:16:52] <Fogin[Work]> [gr]ouzo12 if($('#bob').hasclass()){ ... } I mean
[11:17:03] <rickomax> necromancer: lot of thanks man, you're master x)
[11:17:30] <tucan> if my autocomplete isnt working on any page except homepage, what does that mean?
[11:17:52] <thomb> djquery, bot-t is the demo better now?
[11:18:12] <kborchers> tucan: do you have jquery and jquery ui included on the other pages?
[11:18:24] <djQuery> ?imabot@thomb
[11:18:25] <bot-t> thomb, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[11:18:29] <Fogin[Work]> [gr]ouzo12 or you can do " var node = $(this); var hasFailed = node.hasClass('failedvalidation'); if (hasFailed){ ..} but its extra lines
[11:18:31] <tucan> kborchers: yes i do
[11:18:56] <kborchers> tucan: something has to be different. link?
[11:18:59] <[gr]ouzo12> for the else statement a " else{...} is enought?
[11:19:09] <Fogin[Work]> yes
[11:19:25] <[gr]ouzo12> nice,thanks!
[11:19:48] <tucan> kborchers: http://www.koreandictionary.net/  please go to an inner page and enter a few letters in search box,  the script nearly crashes
[11:20:42] <tucan> im not sure what's happening
[11:21:12] <swiggy> how can i loop through all the tabs in a pane?
[11:21:14] <Fogin[Work]> inless you have mulitable Class you want to match on IE if($('#bob').hasclass('redBox1')) { .. } else if($('#bob').hasclass('blueBox1')){ ... } else { ..}
[11:21:28] <djQuery> thomb: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Yju5v/3/
[11:22:10] <kborchers> tucan: is the path to words.pl the same from all pages?
[11:22:29] <tucan> oh
[11:22:40] <tucan> thats why
[11:22:49] <tucan> i need extra slash
[11:23:00] <Fogin[Work]> swiggy how are you tabes made ?
[11:23:43] <thomb> djQuery: thx, i guess $.each(json_obj.dropable, function(index) {}); works, too but i only get the index not the value
[11:24:06] <thomb> http://jsfiddle.net/Yju5v/4/
[11:24:18] <djQuery> function(i,elm)
[11:24:23] <djQuery> thomb: ^^^^^
[11:24:55] <thomb> ah nice, thx a lot. i'm not used to jquery, just learning :)
[11:24:56] <djQuery> thomb: by the way with .each(i){    this  }
[11:25:06] <djQuery> ?jqf@thomb
[11:25:06] <bot-t> thomb, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[11:26:00] <thomb> djQuery: i'll bookmark it and try to find time reading
[11:26:17] <StimpyDash> I'm starting as well
[11:26:30] <shankysv87> $("#loadedpage").load("./index.php #home_div"); works however, i'm not sure its actually doing what i want.  I think its actually loading the entire page over again, pulling the required stuff then ditching the rest, then placing the pulled stuff into said container.  This is actually not the process i'm looking for.
[11:26:38] <StimpyDash> I'm working from Novice to Ninja. It's good so far :)
[11:26:45] <StimpyDash> It has characters!
[11:27:14] <Krambfhase> i cant imagine a book without characters.
[11:27:15] <Fogin[Work]> swiggy var mytabs = $('li'); mytabs.each(function(){ .. } Should work
[11:27:19] <shankysv87> without reloading anything more, i just want it to just display the already loaded content within the same page that was previously not visible because of the hidden div.
[11:27:26] <StimpyDash> I mean characters like Jar Jar Binks :p
[11:27:39] <StimpyDash> Not as in 140 in a twitter message characters
[11:27:57] <swiggy> wont that just loop through the tab's tab, not the pane/panel?
[11:28:12] <swiggy> i need to set a loading image to content for each of the tabs panel
[11:28:17] <swiggy> but the tabs change dynamically
[11:28:24] <swiggy> so they are never a 'set' amount
[11:29:01] <kborchers> ?demo @ swiggy
[11:29:01] <bot-t> swiggy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:29:13] <djQuery> swiggy: if you have access to the tabs tab you sould then be able to get the pannel
[11:31:18] <Null_> so, still trying to work out why http://hansandholly.ca/test/#/pages/listing.php?mls=E2131504 works in FF/Chrome/IE9, but not IE8 (and I don't think IE7)... think I finally have an error in IE8 involving this line: http://jsfiddle.net/vuycP/  which would explain the data not loading, but not sure why that line is erroring on IE7/8 only.
[11:31:59] <shankysv87> just to perhaps help, this is from my index.php file: http://pastebin.com/An5c89e1
[11:34:46] <ElCapitanMarklar> hey guys, i've hit a bit of a speed bump - http://pastebin.com/Jpvu4k0d - i am trying to add a method to an object - ( MyTime.get_total() ). i am using the latest jquery but i've gotten myself into a bit of a muddle here. can someone advise the best way to achieve what im trying to do using the correct jquery way?
[11:35:51] <foxhoundz> Excuse me
[11:36:04] <systemfault> You're forgiven.
[11:36:06] <foxhoundz> When using $.submit, does it matter if you return true or false
[11:36:18] <foxhoundz> it still cancels normal submit behavior right?
[11:36:40] <Krambfhase> ElCapitanMarklar: try this: http://pastebin.com/M9VPVHEL you do know Date though, right?
[11:39:05] <ElCapitanMarklar> Krambfhase: you legend. yeap I know about Date, that was just a quick sample i threw together to get my question accross
[11:39:06] <ElCapitanMarklar> thanks
[11:39:44] <Krambfhase> np
[11:39:55] <Krambfhase> inheritance in JS is hard
[11:40:59] <systemfault> I always though of it as being unusual but easy :/
[11:41:46] <foxhoundz> SOmeone must know!
[11:41:50] <foxhoundz> Someone*
[11:42:27] <necromancer> how do i disable jQuery.validate's live validation?
[11:42:45] <djQuery> foxhoundz: well returning false will keep it from submiting. returning true will have no affect compared to not returning at all
[11:42:55] <necromancer> foxhoundz: a google search could have turned this up for you
[11:43:10] <soc42> hi #jquery
[11:43:20] <necromancer> foxhoundz: you should probably read http://css-tricks.com/6809-return-false-and-prevent-default/
[11:44:00] <necromancer> personally i like to use e.preventDefault() for form submission and e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); for blocking link clicks
[11:44:33] <necromancer> it's a little more verbose but it helps me understand exactly what's going on
[11:44:45] <necromancer> instead of relying on what is essentially a pseudo-hack
[11:46:42] <djQuery> $('#myform').submit(function(e){      var err=[]; $(this).find('input[required]').each(function(i,elm){ var $elm = $(elm); if(!$elm.val()) err.push(elm.name + ' is required'); })  if(err.length){ e.preventDefault(); do something to show the error}  })
[11:46:50] <djQuery> foxhoundz: ^^^^^^^^
[11:47:05] <soc42> can anybody please have a look at this?
[11:47:09] <soc42> http://pastebin.com/H6qwFvVv
[11:48:05] <soc42> i am trying to submit a html form select value via post
[11:48:08] <stalecache> i need to prepend some html to an element... is there a more preferred way to prepend instead of using $.prepend(html)? The html is <div class="cls1"></div><div class="cls2" style="color:red;"></div>
[11:48:14] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/j4SEZ/3/
[11:48:48] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/j4SEZ/3/ -- when a tab is selected i want all the other tabs to be set to <img src="/animage.gif">
[11:48:48] <Krambfhase> ?before @ stalecache
[11:48:49] <bot-t> stalecache, .before(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
[11:48:53] <swiggy> but  NOT the selected tab
[11:48:59] <swiggy> how do i loop through them
[11:49:05] <kborchers> soc42: you're missing a { after function(), but all you really need to do is .submit()
[11:49:16] <choffstein> if I have a javascript function (call it f()) embedded in "embed.html" that I put in an iframe (with id: "frame"), can I set a listener on that iframe for when it "shows" to have that javascript function run?
[11:49:22] <stalecache> Krambfhase, thanks, i'l check it out
[11:49:55] <choffstein> so something like $("#frame")[0].contentWindow.bind("show", ...)
[11:50:05] <soc42> you mean... onchange="jQuery('#formselect').submit();"  that's all?
[11:50:12] <kborchers> yep
[11:50:51] <soc42> i didn't expect it to be that easy ;o)
[11:50:51] <djQuery> swiggy:  you do know that tabs support having href point to a url to load the data dynamicaly right
[11:51:04] <Krambfhase> swiggy: http://jsfiddle.net/j4SEZ/4/
[11:51:17] <djQuery> swiggy: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#ajax
[11:51:46] <swiggy> yes but that is not my problem
[11:51:55] <swiggy> there is a FLOUC type issue
[11:51:58] <swiggy> with preloaded content
[11:52:07] <swiggy> its hard2 explain without showing
[11:52:15] <swiggy> but its not live so also hard to show
[11:52:25] <kborchers> soc42: but really, i think you could get away with just this.form.submit
[11:52:32] <kborchers> no jQuery necessary there
[11:52:42] <foxhoundz> Back
[11:52:42] <swiggy> but i just need a way to loop through all the tab panes (besides the current selected/shown tab) and set the content to an image
[11:52:47] <djQuery> swiggy: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/j4SEZ/5/
[11:52:49] <foxhoundz> Thanks for the info
[11:53:06] <foxhoundz> I actually went to jQuery docs, didn't find the info there so I figured Google would be useless ;-)
[11:53:28] <swiggy> isnt that for the tab itself djQuery
[11:53:30] <swiggy> not the panel?
[11:53:55] <djQuery> swiggy: whats it matter if they arent actualy visisble at that point?
[11:54:26] <vasocreta> this may not be appropriate for the jQuery forum specifically, but you guys will let me know that. Does anyone here do anything like this to check for jQuery? http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/H7ckQ/
[11:54:45] <soc42> kborchers: you're right...
[11:54:55] <Decavolt> I'm having trouble clearing an interval with a function. Any ideas? stopLoop() on line 39 isn't working: http://pastebin.com/sxNQSyMf
[11:55:06] <swiggy> just looks funny
[11:55:12] <swiggy> when you change tabs
[11:55:16] <swiggy> and the previous content is flashed
[11:55:16] <soc42> i am starting to think more likely in jquery than in pure js ;o)
[11:55:21] <swiggy> b4 the ajax content is loaded
[11:56:30] <djQuery> swiggy: you mean something like this http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/j4SEZ/6/
[11:56:30] <bjensen> lets say I have $('#user') and its gone, how can I check if its still part of the DOM?
[11:57:04] <kborchers> Decavolt: it's because infiniteLoop is defined in the scope of startLoop. you can't access that var in stopLoop
[11:57:34] <choffstein> is there a way to assign a callback when show() is called?
[11:57:44] <swiggy> yes that will help ty djQuery
[11:58:09] <kborchers> ?show @ choffstein
[11:58:09] <bot-t> choffstein, .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[11:58:11] <Fogin[Work]> vasocreta I do
[11:58:24] <djQuery> bjensen: if(!$('#user').length){console.log('wtf who deleted my element');}
[11:58:54] <choffstein> kborchers: I need something more like $("#element").bind('show', function() { ... } );
[11:59:00] <choffstein> which doesn't seem to work ...
[11:59:25] <kborchers> choffstein: because show is not an event
[11:59:33] <choffstein> unless I add the callback to show() itself, which I don't want to (it's being called from someone else's library).
[11:59:40] <vasocreta> Fogin: do you ever run into an issue where you get $ is undefined because the library did not load fast enough for the plugins?
[11:59:50] <Fogin[Work]> nope
[11:59:57] <choffstein> kborchers: I know, which why I am asking if there is a way to work around it :)
[12:00:13] <djQuery> choffstein: it will if instead of useing .show you do $('#element').trigger('show');
[12:00:29] <Decavolt> kborchers:  Is what I'm trying to do possible - to re-reference infiniteLoop once it's been fired?
[12:00:46] <choffstein> djQuery: show() is being called from another library.  I don't want to alter that person's library unless I really, really need to
[12:01:10] <djQuery> choffstein: is it a ui.widget ?
[12:01:14] <Decavolt> obviously the way I'm doing it won't work, but is that setInterval totally inaccessible once triggered
[12:01:18] <bjensen> djQuery: more like if I do var userNode = $('#user'); userNode.exists?
[12:01:28] <vasocreta> Fogin: sh*t! That is the issue I am having. If I just put the jquery in a script tag normally, I do not get the issue. But most of my plugins fail to execute because the library does not load quickly enough.
[12:01:30] <choffstein> djQuery: it is the skeleton-css package (getskeleton.com)
[12:01:43] <Fogin[Work]> vasocreta i do this all the time when loading stuff in to iframes and divs all the time - http://jsfiddle.net/H7ckQ/1/
[12:02:29] <Fogin[Work]> there was some coldfuions in the code i had to cut out
[12:02:32] <djQuery> bjensen: $('whatever') will allways return a jQuery object. you need to check the length of it to verify that it didnt return anything
[12:03:16] <ajpiano> Decavolt, http://pastebin.com/8mHLpJHs
[12:03:19] <kborchers> Decavolt: i think if you just define infiniteLoop outside of the function, then set it in startLoop, you can reference it in stopLoop
[12:03:27] <ajpiano> create the variable that will contain the interval in a higher scope
[12:03:29] <vasocreta> Fogin: our workplace has a policy to avoid using document.write. But you are doing, essentially, the same thing I am. I am baffled. This has been 2 weeks of PITA investigation.
[12:03:34] <dtach> im using the following code, when i click my button to try and get the file i get 's is undefined' and it links to the jquery.js But when i click my button right after (so a second time) there is no error and things work fine http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/p4ZL5/ (demo wont work since its only allowed on same domain)
[12:03:56] <kborchers> Decavolt: ajpiano just beat me to the punch ;)
[12:04:22] <vasocreta> Fogin: so any GUESSES as to why my script would slow down the jq library loading to the point where the plugins throw $ is undefined?
[12:04:24] <Decavolt> Ahhh, now that makes sense. Thanks ajpiano. And thank you kborchers.
[12:04:46] <Decavolt> Been fighting with this for far too long, and you just helped me get over the hurdle.  :D
[12:04:52] <ajpiano> :)
[12:05:38] <[gr]ouzo12> How is it possible to make a div appear only when a menu link is click and stay there,no matter of refresh times, untill some1 hits the "close" button?
[12:05:42] <Decavolt> Works perfectly now. woohoo!
[12:06:18] <Fogin[Work]> you could do http://jsfiddle.net/H7ckQ/2/
[12:06:24] <djQuery> [gr]ouzo12: using client side only code its not possible.
[12:07:14] <djQuery> [gr]ouzo12: well I take that back u could probably set a cookie when the link is clicked then unset when the close button is clicked
[12:07:53] <vasocreta> Fogin: I have done that too. The alerts pop up but the plugins still throw $ is undefined. Now if I load jq locally, it all works fine.
[12:08:02] <[gr]ouzo12> Ok! Goin to dig for jquery and cookie's in my cave! Thanks!
[12:08:17] <djQuery> [gr]ouzo12: see ?.cookie

[12:08:40] <Fogin[Work]> vasocreta What about this http://jsfiddle.net/H7ckQ/5/
[12:08:51] <lopakodo> hey guys, i'm using jquery to hide a link (display:none). can that link be exploited and clicked even though it's hidden?
[12:08:56] <Decavolt> ajpiano: So that I understand what's happening, can you tell me what the && is doing on this line? infiniteLoop && clearInterval(infiniteLoop);
[12:09:08] <Fogin[Work]> are you loading .js or min.js
[12:09:28] <ajpiano> Decavolt, in JS, && can be used like an if statement
[12:09:32] <ajpiano> jslint hates you for doing it
[12:09:34] <ajpiano> but it's perfectly valid
[12:09:46] <Decavolt> Great, thank you
[12:09:46] <Fogin[Work]> and what url you loading it from
[12:09:48] <ajpiano> so if (foo) { bar() } can also be written as foo && bar();
[12:09:55] <Decavolt> nice
[12:10:23] <Fogin[Work]> we keep all JS local
[12:12:24] <Fogin[Work]> If we write some thing for 1.6.1 we like to keep control on the version so we not getting issues from say google.latest.jquery.js or what ever the hosted Js is
[12:14:59] <janthony> Any idea why .toggle() wouldn't work if the element has style="display: none;" on it? It should be changing it to display: block;. No errors on console, and the click is firing properly.
[12:16:00] <Jorijn> Hi there
[12:16:00] <janthony> It just keeps toggling from display: none to display: none;
[12:16:35] <djQuery> janthony: nopers
[12:16:43] <djQuery> ?demo@janthony
[12:16:44] <bot-t> janthony, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:16:52] <Jorijn> I'm unable to animate an absolute placed div with a negative left-value to something even more negative, the expected result would be that the div is moving to the left.
[12:16:53] <Fogin[Work]> what if you set it to Display: ' '; then try and toggle it on
[12:16:57] <Jorijn> Can anybody confirm this?
[12:18:52] <PKKid-Work> janthony, Are you dynamically placing (using jQuery) the toggle button in your HTML?
[12:19:19] <janthony> PKKid-Work: Nope, the element already exists in the dom.
[12:19:54] <hiryu> how i do for get all options of a jquery slider?
[12:19:59] <hiryu> ops
[12:20:06] <PKKid-Work> janthony, And if you place a console.log('toggling'); inside the toggle function, it is being executed?
[12:20:21] <janthony> PKKid-Work: yup
[12:20:45] <janthony> PKKid-Work: firebug also shows the toggle adding/removing display: none;. so it's toggling form display: none; to display: none;
[12:20:54] <janthony> PKKid-Work: It's skipping the display: block;
[12:20:59] <PKKid-Work> janthony, what if you start with it visible?
[12:21:24] <blindMoe> hiryu: not sure what you are asking exactly but to see the options just open the .js file and look what is listed or read the docs for the slider
[12:21:55] <hiryu> blindMoe:  $('#slider').slider('option') is the reply of my question:)
[12:22:00] <Fogin[Work]> janthony : it works form em
[12:22:33] <hiryu> the real question is: http://jsfiddle.net/hiryu/g2jZZ/
[12:22:39] <PKKid-Work> janthony, Also, is it possibly you bound the toggle function to the element twice?
[12:22:44] <PKKid-Work> possible*
[12:22:54] <Fogin[Work]> works for me -- onclick="javascript: $('#togme').toggle();" with a <table class="borderedtable" border="0" id="togme" width="100%" style="display: none;>
[12:23:55] <janthony> PKKid-Work: yeah, I'll have to look through. my jquery file (I created) is over 500 lines long, so might take awhile to debug
[12:24:10] <leefaus> i am using a jquery dialog.  i have a table of values and i want to have a detail dialog for the information
[12:24:22] <PKKid-Work> Binding the toggle element twice seems like the most logical explanation to me, I have done it before by being too liberal with my binding selectors.
[12:24:32] <leefaus> how can i set the dialog text from an a href inside the table?
[12:25:28] <delinquentme> looking for a quick and solid jquery scroll bar replacement
[12:25:37] <delinquentme> anyone know of anything  / able to make suggestions?
[12:25:47] <Fogin[Work]> leefaus are the detail on the page just hidden or you goig to fetch them on click
[12:26:12] <leefaus> either would work
[12:26:26] <janthony> PKKid-Work: yup, that is exactly what I did. I was combining some js files to one  and there was a duplicate function. Thakns!
[12:26:29] <leefaus> using rails so pretty easy to incorporate either
[12:26:32] <janthony> Thanks*
[12:26:49] <leefaus> trying to get hidden to work right now
[12:26:59] <Fogin[Work]> umm i have a CF component that dose it for me
[12:27:12] <ekkis> hei guys, why doesn't this work? $('<html><body><div>x</div></body></html>').find('div').val()
[12:27:36] <kborchers> leefaus: you'll need a hidden element that will act as your dialog. initialize the dialog on dom ready and set autoOpen to false. bind onclick of the <a> to a function that loads the details into the hidden dialog's .html(), then $("element").dialog('open')
[12:27:59] <systemfault> ekkis: Try .text()
[12:28:04] <leefaus> ok
[12:28:10] <systemfault> ekkis: .val() is more for form elements
[12:28:21] <ekkis> the problem is that .find() fails
[12:28:34] <PKKid-Work> janthony, Awesome, glad you got it fixed.
[12:28:44] <dtach> im using $.get() on first attempt i get 'Uncaught ReferenceError: s is not defined' s not $, and i dont have any vars named 's' when i run the code again (its under a button) the get() works. ideas on how to fix?
[12:28:58] <ekkis> systemfault: .text() returns "" - not surprisingly
[12:29:09] <Fogin[Work]> leefaus http://pastebin.com/9jJs7PSG
[12:29:12] <ekkis> this is very basic.  I don't get why it doesn't work
[12:29:52] <monk12> hello all, i am here to ask an awful question... I need a jquery plugin like Lightbox2/Colorbox that works in... Quirks Mode. blah! Sorry had to ask, have to use one in one of our old crappy systems.
[12:30:22] <Fogin[Work]> You should be able to get enough info from that to build your own method
[12:31:27] <orl> Hi!
[12:31:36] <systemfault> ekkis: From what I can see, it ignores html and body
[12:31:49] <Fogin[Work]> it works with ajax or content on the page
[12:32:01] <kborchers> ekkis: not sure but it may be because jQuery actually tries to create that element in your selector so it is trying to create a new html document, inside the current dom. try changing it to $("<div><p><span>x</span></p></div").find("span").text() and i bet it works
[12:32:02] <imsky> daaamn, #jquery is the number 4 chan on freenode
[12:32:03] <ekkis> systemfault: but it should pick up the div
[12:32:05] <clockwize> guys, is it possible to get a method called when a attribute on a element changes?
[12:32:06] <amid_hasan> hi
[12:32:11] <Woet> ?paste @ dtach
[12:32:12] <bot-t> dtach, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:32:15] <systemfault> ekkis: It does, it's the only element created
[12:32:19] <PKKid-Work> imsky, Where do you see the list?
[12:32:25] <imsky> PKKid-Work: through /list
[12:32:34] <dtach> http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/p4ZL5/ though it wont load because it's only on my domain
[12:32:38] <imsky> we're trailing ##linux just by 53 people
[12:32:45] <systemfault> ekkis: $('<html><body><div>x</div></body></html>').text();
[12:32:46] <PKKid-Work> imsky, logical enough.. :P
[12:33:02] <Woet> dtach: okay, link to your domain?
[12:33:52] <amid_hasan> How to get current time of system in jquery in military time formatted: 00:00:00 ?
[12:33:53] <ekkis> kborchers: no... this also fails: $('<div>x</div>').find('div').html()
[12:34:17] <djQuery> jsisjs@amid_hasan
[12:34:22] <ekkis> systemfault: that last line only brings you back the text you put in.  it doesn't solve the .find() problem
[12:34:24] <kborchers> right because find searches within that div and there are no divs inside the div
[12:34:30] <djQuery> ?jsisjs@ amid_hasan
[12:34:31] <bot-t> amid_hasan, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[12:34:38] <ekkis> kborchers: oh... right
[12:34:54] <amid_hasan> djQuery: thanks!
[12:35:11] <ekkis> kborchers: $('<p><div>x</div></p>').find('div').html() returns null
[12:35:30] <amid_hasan> Also, if I want to compare the system time to time in another variable, i.e. find the nearest variable time based on system time, what operators do I use?
[12:36:25] <kborchers> ekkis: what does $('<p><div>x</div></p>').html() give you. x?
[12:36:33] <Fogin[Work]> leefaus it also has built in resizeing on resize of the dialog

[12:37:06] <lacrymology> hi.. I'm trying to parse an html object and transform it into something else. Specifically, I get a bunch of <p class='header'>foo</p><p>content</p><p class='header'>....etc and I want to turn it into what jquery-ui tabs expect, which is an ul with the headers, and a bunch of <div>s with the contents..
[12:37:11] <lacrymology> where do I get started?
[12:37:17] <thomb> out of interest: would someone be interested in an interactive map? like google maps combined with the possibility to move objects?
[12:37:27] <kborchers> ekkis: hmmm
[12:37:53] <ekkis> so the problem is that $('') isn't really making anything
[12:37:55] <lacrymology> I made a loop and have the list of headers with the list of contents as each one's 'content' member
[12:38:02] <ekkis> which is why .find() can't find anything
[12:38:05] <ekkis> but why?
[12:38:17] <lacrymology> and I.. don't know how to build an object from it now, I guess
[12:38:22] <kborchers> ekkis: probably because it hasn't been inserted into the dom
[12:38:48] <systemfault> ekkis: Because it ignored html and body... creates the div and returns that div
[12:38:52] <systemfault> *ignores
[12:39:18] <kborchers> ekkis: out of curiosity, is this just a learning exercise or are you trying to do something with this. might be a different way around your problem
[12:39:21] <ekkis> kborchers: I'd like to say that were true but this works: $('<p />').html('<div>x</div>').find('div').html()
[12:39:23] <systemfault> ekkis: So basically, $('<html><body><div>x</div></body></html>').text() is the same as $('<div>x</div>').text()
[12:39:48] <ekkis> systemfault: you're a bit behind.  we don't have html or body tags in the string
[12:40:32] <ekkis> kborchers: I'm trying to load a div with html from an ajax call and need to run the scripts therein contained.  the problem is I can't find them
[12:41:40] <systemfault> ekkis: I found the "problem"
[12:42:07] <systemfault> ekkis: For $('<p><div>x</div></p>').text() , it creates an array of 3 nodes
[12:42:25] <ekkis> ok...
[12:42:35] <systemfault> It's a weird behavior... but well
[12:44:05] <ekkis> I think that basically $('<div>x</div>') doesn't do what I thought it did i.e. to create a DOM
[12:44:31] <ekkis> to do that I'd have to: $('<div />').html('x')
[12:44:57] <systemfault> ekkis: Seems you can but you have only have 1 root element
[12:45:06] <systemfault> Weird behavior.. but heh..
[12:45:23] <ekkis> that would be ok because then I could .find() on that root element
[12:45:29] <ekkis> but I can't
[12:45:51] <systemfault> Perhaps you could create one element then use .html() to set the markup?
[12:46:03] <systemfault> Then have fun with selectors and everything
[12:47:02] <sadmicrowave> while I know much about javascript and jquery I'm relatively new to irc. How do I request voice on a channel that continually replies: "Cannot send to channel"
[12:47:17] <kborchers> ekkis: so are you going to be searching for <script>? even if you got it, i don't think you can execute anything in there, i think it's all just text
[12:47:22] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: typically that means the channel requires you to have a registered nick to talk
[12:47:28] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: /msg nickserv help
[12:47:48] <larzen-wrk> how do I outout to console?
[12:48:00] <kborchers> larzen-wrk console.log
[12:48:01] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: In some channels, you must be registered to freenode to have a voice.
[12:48:41] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano, nickserv says I'm already registered though
[12:49:03] <doncams> hey sadmicrowave
[12:49:06] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave, but you haven't IDENTIFY'd yet
[12:49:15] <ekkis> kborchers: if i attach it to my doc it'll execute
[12:49:15] * ajpiano /ns identify nick pass
[12:49:21] <[gr]ouzo12> Incoming Newbie question :
[12:49:40] <Assimilater> would $('span[stage=*]') be considered a valid selector if a span has the stage attribute?
[12:49:41] <[gr]ouzo12> What da hell is that "foo" i see everywhere when it has to do with js or jq?
[12:49:42] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano, nice
[12:49:51] <kborchers> ekkis: so you just want to execute whatever is there, not a specific function correct?
[12:49:57] <Krambfhase> foobar
[12:50:00] <sadmicrowave> [gr]ouzo12, lol, its just dummy data
[12:50:29] <[gr]ouzo12> I thought it was some term or something :P
[12:50:45] <systemfault> Assimilater: If you just want to know if an attribute is present then it's just [theAttribute]
[12:51:00] <sadmicrowave> doncams, hey
[12:51:01] <Assimilater> i want to select all spans that have a given attribute
[12:51:07] <muay-guy> hello, is it possible to set the jquery-ui datepicker so instead of mm/dd/yyyy I get dd/mm/yyyy ?
[12:51:49] <kborchers> muay-guy: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[12:52:19] <Assimilater> so $('span[stage]')?
[12:52:37] <pmarsh> When using getJSON on a validated json feed with a 200 HTTP result, but an empty response, there a way to see what errors it's encountering?
[12:52:47] <Assimilater> systemfault: i *think* that's what you were saying
[12:52:57] <systemfault> Assimilater: Yes :)

[13:08:35] <g0bl1n> 'jsonp' request is adding 2 params:   ?callback=2312313_123123&_=3123123
[13:08:43] <lacrymology> doncams: believe it or not, you saved my life, I was gonna go bannannas trying to set up a <ul> by hand
[13:08:52] <g0bl1n> does it need the second one ?
[13:09:27] <ekkis> kborchers: it gets even better.  as I said, this works: $('<p />').html('<div>x</div>').find('div').html()
[13:09:35] <doncams> lacrymology, :)
[13:09:44] <sadmicrowave> doncams, that looks nice though
[13:09:47] <ekkis> kborchers: however, this doesn't: $('<p />').html('<script>x=1</script>').find('script').html()
[13:09:50] <ravenglass_dan> Krambfhase: http://jsfiddle.net/2zquY/2/
[13:09:53] <ekkis> or this: $('<p />').html('<script>x=1</script>').find('script').text()
[13:10:09] <doncams> sadmicrowave, using fadeIn now
[13:10:39] <doncams> let me just upload the files
[13:10:41] <doncams> heh
[13:10:48] <Krambfhase> ravenglass_dan: hm, the code looks ok. is your page live?
[13:11:02] <sadmicrowave> doncams, the only bad thing about fadeIn/fadeOut is that IE doesn't respect the position of a callback for those functions.
[13:11:40] <doncams> ooops. i still see flickering
[13:11:46] <ravenglass_dan> Krambfhase: Nope, it's running on my computer locally.  That's too bad, I was hoping that maybe this was a bug that everyone knew about except for me.
[13:12:07] <ravenglass_dan> Krambfhase: Thank you for helping! I'll go back and do some more research on this problem.
[13:12:18] <Krambfhase> what error do you get?
[13:13:03] <ravenglass_dan> Krambfhase: That would be helpful information! It's a 500 Internal Server Error.
[13:13:20] <Krambfhase> 500? ufff
[13:14:01] <ravenglass_dan> Krambfhase: It's calling a ColdFusion component. But I don't think that there's anything wrong with the ColdFusion code because it works fine in Chrome!
[13:14:01] <systemfault> It's under 9000 :/
[13:14:03] <ale_> hellp does someone know the channel for jqueryui?
[13:14:23] <Krambfhase> do you check if the url created by the code is correctly pares on the server side?
[13:14:30] <kborchers> ekkis: for a laugh, can you try $(htmlFromAJAXReq).find("script"); ?
[13:15:48] <ravenglass_dan> Krambfhase: No, I don't. What exactly would that entail? Would that mean writing server-side or client-side code?
[13:16:21] <ekkis> kborchers: I did.  that's how I started
[13:16:28] <ekkis> when that failed I tried something simpler
[13:16:47] <ekkis> kborchers: I've posted an SO on this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6512568/extracting-a-script
[13:16:51] <trose> anyone know of a good way to create a video popup similar to lightbox? I need to use video from the server, not youtube or other hosting services
[13:16:56] <Krambfhase> ravenglass_dan: i mean, if agency_id contains special characters they might need to be encoded
[13:17:11] <kborchers> ekkis: this is making my brain hurt :/
[13:17:12] <Krambfhase> but still, 500 sounds bad
[13:17:55] <ekkis> kborchers: LoL - there's something special about scripts... I've run into something similar before but I no longer remember
[13:18:02] <ravenglass_dan> Krambfhase: agency_id is just an integer. No special characters there.
[13:18:26] <kborchers> ekkis: same here, that is why it's really bothering me. i'll keep an eye on your SO post
[13:18:32] <Krambfhase> hmm, weird. dunno. thats all i know
[13:18:54] <ekkis> thx
[13:19:22] <ravenglass_dan> Krambfhase: I just have to do some more research, that's all. Thanks for your help.

[13:20:52] <Famic> how would you do to select all elements with .myclass OR with value=myValue ?
[13:21:08] <datarecall> I am trying to keep a running tally count of a variable in an everyTime(5000, function(i) { but it seems that after every pass the variables go underfined ?
[13:21:13] <Famic> from a find()
[13:21:48] <systemfault> Famic: .find('.myClass, [value="myValue"]') ?
[13:22:38] <Famic> systemfault: great, thanks
[13:23:16] <systemfault> datarecall: You will need a closure for that.
[13:23:28] <doncams> gods of javascript and jQuery. noob question: i'm fading out an <img /> then changing it's source, then fading it back in. I'm using $('img').fadeOut().attr('src','blah').fadeIn(); and it flickers. see http://localhost/greenzinc/test/. is it possible to have it hidden for a period of time before fading In, just to make sure its src is already changed?
[13:23:52] <g0bl1n> wow, my ajax request neither goes success nor error ?!
[13:23:56] <Krambfhase> doncams: use callbacks
[13:24:07] <erichynds> put your attr().fadeIn() inside the complete handler of the fadeOut(), doncams
[13:24:21] <g0bl1n> Krambfhase, are you discussing jsonp callbacks ?
[13:24:43] <doncams> will try that. thanks
[13:24:50] <Krambfhase> huh?
[13:25:30] <g0bl1n> Krambfhase, oh ok
[13:26:22] <g0bl1n> any idea why my jsonp ajax request creates 2 params ?
[13:26:31] <lacrymology> is there a shortcut for .parent().parent()?
[13:26:38] <g0bl1n> 'jsonp' request is adding 2 params:   ?callback=2312313_123123&_=3123123

[13:28:39] <g0bl1n> ok
[13:28:55] <kborchers> lacry
[13:28:59] <kborchers> oops
[13:29:09] <datarecall> thanks systemfault ill give it a shot
[13:29:28] <systemfault> datarecall: You're welcome :)
[13:29:29] <kborchers> lacrymology: you could do .parents("nth-child(2)") but that is slower performance wise
[13:29:49] <systemfault> lacrymology: .closest is the bset
[13:29:51] <systemfault> *best
[13:30:03] <systemfault> lacrymology: Forget about .parent(), it's fragile
[13:30:51] <kborchers> systemfault: closest would only work if there is way to distinguish the parents from each other <div><div><div>text</div></div></div>, closest would not work
[13:30:59] <systemfault> true
[13:31:26] <systemfault> But imho, parent().parent() is a code smell.
[13:32:09] <kborchers> systemfault: i would absolutely use closest over parent().parent() if possible
[13:34:12] <DynamicFail> How could I have a webpage that has a var that is constantly updated Json object
[13:34:21] <DynamicFail> Basically I would like to modify this:
[13:34:23] <DynamicFail> http://paste2.org/p/1493751
[13:34:42] <DynamicFail> Where the var1, var2, var3 etc are different json files on my server that are constantly changing
[13:35:12] <DynamicFail> I have used the setInterval command before to read from a Json file but never to just have the json file directly stored as a var
[13:35:42] <datarecall> systemfault: http://paste2.org/p/1493753 that is the code im using now basically i am keeping a running tally of the data returned on line 28. then if the last run does not equal the same amount of data returned in the previous it will show the notification
[13:36:26] <Krambfhase> DynamicFail: json file directly stored as a var << not sure that is possible. btw, you should really update you jQ version
[13:37:21] <g0bl1n> Krambfhase, http://www.pastie.org/private/lrbo6gbdwdrjtv3hncqnng
[13:37:24] <DynamicFail> Krambfhase, (I will update the library reference) but in that file it looks like the var are stored as just valid json strings

[13:42:08] <amitairos> Thanks
[13:42:25] <miwillhite> hola
[13:42:39] <Krambfhase> g0bl1n: ah, those are jquery internal parameters. Not sure exactly what the do, better not mess with them. i am sure google knows more about that
[13:43:13] <zamba> i have a html form that contains several rows of similar information.. this is for registering players for a tournament.. each row as a number, a name and a birthdate.. the user registering can add new rows by pressing a button.. now i want the number column to only contain unique values.. how can that be done?
[13:43:35] <JacksonB> Favorite dialog window plugin?
[13:44:08] <g0bl1n> Krambfhase, the docs say jQuery will add an extra "?callback=?" to the end of your URL to specify the callback. Yet it seems to be adding two params
[13:44:40] <doncams> it worked!
[13:44:52] <doncams> ok, I just found out about load()
[13:45:53] <DynamicFail> can you use the getJSON to load a json file into a var?
[13:46:00] <g0bl1n> :-O
[13:46:47] <doncams> that's the example in the site DynamicFail. I think that's it
[13:47:01] <miwillhite> DynamicFail: yes, in the callback function, the first parameter should be the returned data, you can set a variable using that
[13:47:31] <DynamicFail> miwillhite, i mean can you actually have the var be the formated json file
[13:48:06] <miwillhite> DynamicFail, not sure about thatâ€¦why do you need to retain the formatting?
[13:48:11] <techouse> so i made myself a slider like here http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#range now how do i send those values that i slide to into the value attribute of an <input> html tag so i can then pick it up with PHP?
[13:48:35] <techouse> or is ajax mandatory for such a thing?
[13:50:09] <Demascus> First time trying jquery, wanted to try flexigrid, followed the frankly minimal instructions from http://www.flexigrid.info/ and the code.google.com/p/flexigrid wiki .. I have a php successfully fetching a JSON result on my data, I matched up all the column names, I've linked to Google's CDN, I've linked to the includes, css, and made sure the folders were extracted properly.. I get nothing going on for errors and I don't get where the
[13:50:10] <Demascus> ever 'called' so I am rather sure that's the step that's missing?
[13:50:28] <DynamicFail> I know you could do something like $.getJSON("myfile.js",function(data){$.each(data.header,function(i.data){var mydata = "<div class='box'> "+data.field1+" "+data.field2+" </div> $(div_data.appendTo("#mySection");});});
[13:50:45] <kborchers[A]> ?dialog @ JacksonB

[13:51:22] <DynamicFail> but I want my var to actually have the live values of a json file that is formated. I found some code that converts a json file to an html formated table that I would like to use
[13:51:31] <DynamicFail> but my json files are constantly changing
[13:52:18] <orl> if I use $.load() for navigation (which is not necessarly a good idea), there is absolutely no way to get the url of the file that has been loaded in the address field and the navigation arrows working?
[13:52:23] <DynamicFail> so I was planning on wrapping something with setInterval(function(){ <code> }. 1000);
[13:55:20] * Umren is away: sleep

[13:56:29] <Umren> niko, ok
[13:58:04] * Demascus isn't away but really loves the response time to away messages.. Anyone know anything about flexigrid or something like it for formatting a table?
[14:01:20] <miwillhite> Demascus, I did some research not too long between jqgrid/flexigrid/datatables
[14:01:37] <miwillhite> I personally like datatables the best
[14:01:37] <miwillhite> http://www.datatables.net/
[14:01:47] <miwillhite> it was the most lightweight, modular solution
[14:02:06] <miwillhite> jqgrid was more robust, but was deeply deeply tied to jquery-ui
[14:02:15] <miwillhite> and the code wasn't nearly as pretty
[14:02:33] <miwillhite> plus it was 290k vs 70k
[14:03:36] <lacrymology> systemfault: thanks
[14:04:16] <miwillhite> that being said, we decided tables weren't the answer for our problem so I haven't actually used any of them

[14:06:40] <lacrymology> how can I loop through .next() until I find an element with a given class, and do something with all the rest? that is, I want to turn <a class='x' /><b /><c /><d class='x' /><e /> <f /> into <a> <b /> <c /></a><d><e /><f /></d>
[14:06:58] <imsky> lacrymology: write a for loop
[14:07:22] <lacrymology> imsky: ok, that's what I'm doing.
[14:07:46] <miwillhite> lacrymology, underscore.js has some really nice general functions for that kind of thing
[14:08:19] <kborchers[A]> lacrymology: $(".x").removeClass("x")
[14:08:39] <lacrymology> kborchers[A]: the looping part was my issue, not the removing the class, but thanks =)
[14:08:52] <kborchers[A]> lacrymology: that removes it from all of them
[14:09:14] <kborchers> without a loop
[14:09:32] <lacrymology> kborchers: I was trying to nest things up, look at my example closer
[14:10:11] <kborchers> lacrymology: doesn't matter if they were nested 100 levels deep, $(".x") would find all elements with the x class
[14:10:40] <lacrymology> kborchers: removing the class is not my problem
[14:11:01] <lacrymology> kborchers: I'm taking consecutive elements and nesting some of them inside others
[14:11:35] <Demascus> miwillhite: Awesome reply .. very helpful thanks!
[14:13:03] <kborchers> lacrymology: so your issue was finding the first element with the class?
[14:14:13] <skamikaze> got a question on jquerys closure pattern - it seems like it produces a recursion on its prototype - i don't get it yet

[15:14:42] <snover> tbil: what does that have anything to do with #jquery?
[15:14:52] <skamikaze> clockwize: after including the lib you can do funky stuff like $.extend( { getImage : function ( url, callback ) { return jQuery.get(url, null, callback, "img"); } });
[15:14:56] <clockwize> tbil: no, but it'd be nice to tell them privately first...but if they ignore, do it
[15:15:15] <tbil> can i get arrested for doing so ?

[15:15:40] <janthony> I'm using jquery ui .sortable(), on my li's. It's working great, however, I can't click inside input fields in the li's. It's like the sortable is hijaking with a z-index or something. Any ideas?

[15:19:10] <imsky> lol
[15:19:22] <imsky> we must be communicating through separate universes here
[15:19:24] <ekkis> when I say fails, I mean that I expect the textbox to be cleared, emptied
[15:19:30] <imsky> that's not what .reset does
[15:19:38] <imsky> you want .val('') for that
[15:19:44] <ekkis> it does do something... it resets my listbox but it doesn't clear the textbox
[15:20:11] <ekkis> but I remember that one could clear a whole form in the days before jQuery with a .reset() on the form
[15:20:18] <imsky> 0_o
[15:20:19] <ekkis> there was even an input type to do thaat
[15:20:24] <ekkis> it emptied out all the fields

[15:21:28] <imsky> yeah go read that or something
[15:21:40] * ekkis reads
[15:21:52] <imsky> lol its 4 years old
[15:22:03] <ekkis> imsky: yeah, I saw that page before
[15:22:13] <janthony> n/m, figured it out: $(".couponCatsList").disableSelection(); was set. hopefully I can keep that commented out.
[15:22:24] <ekkis> I just don't understand... I thought I remembered I could just .reset() a form to clear it
[15:22:42] <ekkis> I guess I don't get what .reset() does then
[15:22:58] <imsky> ?reset @ ekkis
[15:22:58] <bot-t> ekkis, :reset: Selects all elements of type reset. http://api.jquery.com/reset-selector/
[15:23:06] <imsky> ?.reset @ ekkis
[15:23:07] <bot-t> ekkis, :reset: Selects all elements of type reset. http://api.jquery.com/reset-selector/
[15:23:10] <imsky> lol
[15:23:13] <imsky> fail all around!
[15:23:26] <ekkis> yes, as a selector, but I'm talking about the javascript form reset function
[15:23:38] <albertosheinfeld> Has anyone used the cooliris plugin??????
[15:23:59] <imsky> oh yeah .reset doesn't exist for forms
[15:24:04] <albertosheinfeld> i need to emulate how they appear a little button on top of each image, having problems though. Anyone knows a plugin for that?
[15:24:41] <ekkis> imsky: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_form_reset
[15:25:16] <imsky> hmm yeah you'll have to get the form object from the jquery object
[15:25:20] <imsky> kinda a...pain
[15:25:31] <imsky> but even then, it won't blank your inputs if you have a preset value
[15:25:58] <ekkis> ah.... that's the problem then
[15:26:07] <ekkis> that's the bit I was missing
[15:26:25] <ekkis> thanks
[15:26:28] <imsky> np bud
[15:28:22] <Richard_Ofc> I'm trying to migrate a jQuery superfish implementation from one bundled in/with a Drupal v6 Fusion subtheme to one provided in/as a Drupal v7 module.  I've had to modify a bunch of CSS tags, but other than that, I've managed to reproduce the function I want.  Except ...
[15:28:30] <Richard_Ofc> in the 'new' case, my Superfish submenus init open/pulled-down, and stay that way.  I can select items in the submenu, but the silly things won't roll-up, or down for that matter.
[15:28:36] <Richard_Ofc>  Hoping for a pointer as to what/where I should be looking at ... so far can't figure out what I've missed :-/
[15:34:50] <reduxo> Is there a way to select a specific object out of an array by one of it's properties? like var array = [ {name: "a", other: "jjom"},  {name: "b", other: "jjom"},  {name: "c", other: "jjom"}]
[15:35:03] <reduxo> how wold i select the second object only knowing the name is b
[15:35:08] <reduxo> w/o a loop
[15:35:51] <dabear> reduxo: with a loop
[15:35:54] <dabear> :)
[15:36:22] <dabear> seriously
[15:36:23] <reduxo> lol
[15:36:26] <reduxo> only way?

[15:42:52] <duarte> How do you get json content from an iframe element with jquery?
[15:43:22] <duarte> the iframe is the target of a form submit action
[15:43:44] <duarte> the iframe does get the json, but i canÂ´t extract it :(
[15:45:22] <kborchers> duarte: why don't you just handle the form submit yourself and use getJSON()
[15:45:31] <kborchers> ?getJSON @ duarte
[15:45:32] <mikeycgto> duarte, from the parent window you want to access a iframe?
[15:45:32] <bot-t> duarte, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[15:45:55] <kborchers> or you can use ajax() if you need JSONP
[15:46:03] <kborchers> ?ajax @ duarte
[15:46:04] <bot-t> duarte, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:46:43] <kborchers> hope that helps, gotta go
[15:50:30] <duarte> I need to use the iFrame because i am submiting a file
[15:51:17] <duarte> on other forms, i do use the .ajax to custumize the requests
[15:52:31] <duarte> mikeycgto: yes, from a parent window, i need to access the content of the iFrame, whoÂ´s content is a json text response
[15:54:02] <k4r1m> hello
[15:56:54] <k4r1m> I have a feeling this is a very bad "way" to accomplish what I'm doing http://pastebin.com/tUt7D6FV even though it works, any thoughts?
[15:58:01] <mikeycgto> duarte, i know theres been several plugins to handle "ajax file uploads" that use an iframe to achieve
[15:58:04] <mikeycgto> it
[16:09:31] <chipnt> hi everyone
[16:09:41] <jonathansampson> Hello chipnt.
[16:10:17] <chipnt> i am trying to integrate http://oboexpress.com/test/index.html but ill have to get an idea of how i could make flags go behind earth
[16:10:34] <chipnt> im not a js/jquery guru i only understand it
[16:10:42] <chipnt> i used 3d carousel library
[16:11:58] <chipnt> or is there anyother example already doing this ?
[16:12:56] <zec-> (btw.. chipnt, your html is invalid. You are missing a quote after the style attribute on the last div ;p)
[16:13:44] <chipnt> ohh uhh
[16:13:47] <chipnt> :)
[16:13:48] <chipnt> thx
[16:14:22] <chipnt> right
[16:14:23] <chipnt> saw it
[16:14:25] <chipnt> :)
[16:16:25] <joshsmith> is there any way to convert a JSON object into a string (to output to the browser)?
[16:17:51] <joshsmith> JSON.stringify()?
[16:18:20] <joshsmith> it is; nevermind
[16:20:22] <zangetsu> hello
[16:23:33] <mikeycgto> joshsmith, keep it mind JSON.stringify() might not be available on all browsers
[16:23:39] <mikeycgto> mainly IE6\7 do not support it
[16:23:51] <joshsmith> gotcha, I just needed it to do some testing
[16:23:53] <joshsmith> thanks though
[16:24:22] <zangetsu> i can simulate a click from $('a#1') to  $('a#2') ?
[16:24:31] <zangetsu> .trigger('click') don't help me
[16:24:49] <zangetsu> i have a loop of clicks :)
[16:25:02] <mikeycgto> if you need support in those archaic browsers take a look at: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[16:29:23] <joshsmith> ah this is driving me nuts
[16:29:28] <AfroTurf> will .filter return false if it can't find the selector?
[16:29:43] <joshsmith> I'm using $.ajax() to POST JSON
[16:29:54] <joshsmith> and the server doesn't seem to be getting anything at all
[16:30:03] <joshsmith> it should be an object with 416 nested objects
[16:30:27] <mikeycgto> well is it setting the right content-type? that could matter to your server
[16:30:41] <joshsmith> it's never mattered before
[16:31:33] <joshsmith> honestly just stumped at this point
[16:31:36] <joshsmith> this shouldn't be difficult
[16:33:25] <mikeycgto> can you pastie code joshsmith
[16:33:33] <hierbabuena> I want to have a div always visible. A side menu. If the user scrolls, this div should follow. But the height of this div is higher than the window. So this div should only go up if the user is seeing its top side. And only go down if the user is seeing its bottom side. I remember a plugin that did exactly that but I can't remember the name nor do I know the keyword for what I want. Can you help me?
[16:33:38] <zangetsu> i can simulate a click from $('a#1') to  $('a#2') ?
[16:33:53] <joshsmith> mikeycgto: yeah give me a minute
[16:33:58] <mikeycgto> sure
[16:34:24] <miwillhite> joshsmith: Charles is fantastic for debugging stuff like that: http://www.charlesproxy.com/
[16:34:53] <mikeycgto> i'd just go right the packets with wireshark ;)
[16:35:01] <mikeycgto> to the packets rather
[16:35:04] <joshsmith> so here's the JS code: http://pastebin.com/wu7wWp0b
[16:35:49] <joshsmith> and here's the server-side code: http://pastebin.com/pkxmk5Q9
[16:36:23] <joshsmith> the response.data is JSON
[16:37:41] <joshsmith> should be of the form [{"name":"Some Person","id":"12345"}]
[16:38:31] <mikeycgto> and you get nothing server-side or just not what you're expecting?
[16:39:23] <ryanneufeld> anyone worked with phonegap? I'm trying to perform an ajax call, and it's not co-operating
[16:39:51] <joshsmith> I get nothing
[16:40:09] <joshsmith> it's an empty array
[16:40:26] <tbil> no broken record
[16:40:43] <mikeycgto> well im assuming response.data is an object?
[16:41:00] <joshsmith> yes it is
[16:41:14] <mikeycgto> try doing data: { friends: JSON.stringify(friends) }
[16:41:15] <joshsmith> isn't that JSON? or am I just horribly retarded
[16:41:39] <mikeycgto> JSON is just a way of encoding javascript objects
[16:41:45] <joshsmith> what about the cross-browser problem?
[16:41:46] <tbil> k son
[16:41:50] <joshsmith> I mean I'll do it to test
[16:42:06] <mikeycgto> you can just use https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[16:42:15] <mikeycgto> to add support for JSON where it isn't available
[16:42:18] <tbil> douglas who
[16:42:22] <joshsmith> mikeycgto: that works
[16:42:25] <joshsmith> tbil: lol
[16:42:37] <tbil> corckford!?!
[16:42:54] <mikeycgto> and if you really want to get fancy, you could test for JSON and then load in the lib only if needed
[16:42:58] <tbil> douglas croco.
[16:43:07] <tbil> " Â£ $ % " ! % " "
[16:43:13] <mikeycgto> hes just some guy
[16:43:14] <joshsmith> mikeycgto: I'm confused as to why it wouldn't work with just the straight object
[16:43:15] <tbil> Spin the wheel!
[16:43:17] <mikeycgto> who likes JSON
[16:43:19] <tbil> k son
[16:43:29] <tbil> its a benter!
[16:43:29] <tbil> its a benter!
[16:43:31] <tbil> i got it.
[16:43:45] <mikeycgto> jquery is taking your {friends:friend} object is trying to encode is as a POST form
[16:43:54] <mikeycgto> something like friends=...
[16:44:00] <mikeycgto> rather than send it as JSON
[16:44:17] <joshsmith> so is there any way I can just send it as JSON?
[16:44:25] <tbil> well, just pretend
[16:44:26] <joshsmith> other than having to load in some other dependency
[16:45:22] <mikeycgto> well you can have jquery try and take the friends object and encode it as a query string\POST body
[16:45:29] <mikeycgto> but depending on how deep that object goes, it could get messy
[16:46:40] <mikeycgto> which is what you have no, in your client-side code. try doing var_dump($_POST) server-side to see what the whole thing looks like
[16:47:02] <tbil> looks like , whats that coming over the hill, is it .. a monster?
[16:47:06] <tbil> ...is it a monster?
[16:48:32] <joshsmith> all I really need are the id numbers in a string; maybe it just makes more sense to parseJSON in jQuery and send a string server-side
[16:48:41] <joshsmith> that offloads a little processing to the client-side, too
[16:49:03] <joshsmith> oh wait
[16:49:05] <joshsmith> but it's not JSON
[16:49:53] <joshsmith> well .each() then
[16:49:59] <mikeycgto> yeah the var friends = response.data;
[16:50:00] <joshsmith> what do you think of that approach?
[16:50:06] <mikeycgto> should be a structured object and not a string
[16:50:11] <mikeycgto> so you could just pick out what you need
[16:50:22] <joshsmith> and then send a string over
[16:50:26] <mikeycgto> yeah
[16:50:50] <mikeycgto> just enumerate the object and collect the IDs in an array then just send { friends: arrayOfIds }
[16:53:33] <mikeycgto> ill bbl
[16:55:23] <Assimilater> i don't know if this is the *best* place to ask, but i'm wondering if there's anything jquery or js to play videos and execute a callback function when the video has finished playing
[16:56:57] <niftylettuce> Assimilater: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2954595/html5-video-callbacks/2954618#2954618
[16:57:30] <Assimilater> html5's video support is kind of limited cross-browser, isn't it?
[16:57:38] <Assimilater> i mean it's what's holding up the release after all
[16:58:30] <niftylettuce> Assimilater: jplayer perhaps... question is: do you need to support IE version doo doo?
[16:58:44] <Assimilater> i figure IE version 9+ is good enough
[16:59:09] <Assimilater> but ya probably good to support IE on this particular need as much as i hate it
[16:59:15] <janthony> is it ok to run another ajax request inside of an ajax callback?
[17:00:58] <jdee> janthony: yes
[17:01:07] <janthony> jdee: ok, thanks
[17:05:19] <phishbot> phishbot
[17:11:42] <hierbabuena> How can I know if  the user is scrolling up or down?
[17:12:14] <BrAApp_> just ask them
[17:12:28] <Assimilater> niftylettuce: looks like jplayer fits my needts, thanks
[17:12:28] <BrAApp_> are you trying to rape them?
[17:12:29] <BrAApp_> that's bad
[17:13:03] <niftylettuce> Assimilater: :)
[17:13:23] <nonge_> I want to show/hide a text when clicking on its heading. It works with "slideToggle", but then it also hides, if I click at the text â€¦
[17:16:47] <skamikaze> nonge_: just a guess => check event target
[17:17:22] <skamikaze> or separate the toggled content from the headline in your html structure
[17:17:28] <skamikaze> nn all :)
[17:25:50] <seancurtis> question: do <header> or other html5 elements default to blocks?
[17:26:33] <coldhead> depends on the browser i think, seancurtis
[17:26:46] * coldhead glares at IE
[17:27:07] <seancurtis> should they be blocks?
[17:27:38] <coldhead> if you agree with most browsers and not IE then yes
[17:27:54] <seancurtis> just noticed that using border-box in FF3.6 and IE8 (supported by both) on <header> elements wasn't rendering them as blocks
[17:28:07] <coldhead> with no stylesheet?
[17:28:34] <coldhead> i'm not expert but it seems to be a vexed issue
[17:28:54] <coldhead> if you made them all blocks you could still come play at my house
[17:29:24] <naiad> what's the best way to convert a form into a literal object for an ajax submission ( i need the literal object ) to append more objects later
[17:30:11] <seancurtis> check this out in IE8/FF3.6 - http://jsbin.com/ajiwep/2
[17:30:20] <seancurtis> guess I just need an explicit display: block
[17:30:55] <seancurtis> moving a product to HTML5 and only having to support IE8+/FF4+ etc is sooooo nice
[17:31:22] <seancurtis> box-sizing: border-box, display: table and table-layout: fixed = awesome
[17:32:05] <coldhead> huh
[17:32:24] <coldhead> surprised you guys have ditched Fx 3 already
[17:32:32] <coldhead> lucky for you anyway :)

[17:40:26] <buzzman> i'm using jQuery for a collapse / expand DIV thing ... worx fine except that if its used towards the bottom of a page, then when clicked to expand the DIV it opens below the visible page, that is the page doesn't move to show the expanded DIV and the user has to scroll the page down to see the DIV content ... how do i fix this?  here's the code:  http://jsfiddle.net/TqMvM/

[17:56:26] <buzzman> i can see the room is slow today, but i'd really appreciate if someone took a stab at this really simple issue ... maybe it's a CSS thing, a push in the right direction wud also b a big help   >>>   how do I make the page move when the DIV expands on clicking the "SHOW" link in here:   http://jsfiddle.net/TqMvM/

[18:12:00] <iszak> I've worked with ExtJS Grids before? does that count?
[18:12:31] <bapi__> i was just wondering since i got a problem with it
[18:12:39] <bapi__> a sorting problem that is
[18:12:43] <iszak> well ask away and we'll try out best
[18:14:01] <bapi__> hm ok, heres my current table $('#logentry #table').dataTable({"sPaginationType": "full_numbers","aaSorting": [[ 1, "desc" ]],"bFilter": false, "bInfo": true});
[18:14:23] <bapi__> whenever I add new values they dont go ontop of the datable
[18:14:42] <bapi__> $('#logentry #table').dataTable().fnAddData(["a value"]); like such

[18:18:57] <AricwithanA> Hey, how might I link JS files correctly when using the .load to load content into divs?
[18:19:17] <seancurtis> coldhead: we ditched FF3.0 previously and now FF3.5/3.6 for the next release - most FF users upgrade frequently - unfeasible to be testing in FF3.5/3.6/4.0/5.0
[18:19:45] <seancurtis> coldhead: it's beautiful when you realise how more elegantly you can code in an IE8+ world
[18:20:25] <iszak> IE8 is still crap
[18:20:50] <iszak> IE8 is like the IE6 of modern browsers.
[18:23:07] <Whirl3d> Good evening all. Quick question about .next and .prev that is unclear from api docs: can I do something like :  $("#someListItem").next() to get the next list item or do I have to use a selector that returns a collection of more than one element like $("#someListItem").siblings().next()?
[18:24:53] <Whirl3d> Was someone just giving a eulogy or something and I just barged in? It's so quiet in here.
[18:25:16] <grantg> heh

[18:27:34] <da-beginner> hi all.. how do i select this item using font color as the selector?
[18:27:40] <da-beginner> <div style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); display: block; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px;">             You are required to select exactly 1 from this group         </div>
[18:27:46] <DofLeFou> i want to keep the selected ... but sort that ascending
[18:28:11] <da-beginner> i tried $('div[style[color: rgb(255, 0, 0)]]'); but it is not really working :)
[18:28:39] <Whirl3d> ?color

[18:29:03] <Whirl3d> nope Try $("[color='number']");
[18:29:40] <da-beginner> Whirl3d: what would be the number?
[18:30:24] <Whirl3d> da-beginner, I'm no good with all that. You could also try $("div").css({color:'#F00'});
[18:30:39] <Whirl3d> da-beginner, possibly #F00 ?
[18:31:25] <da-beginner> the source is in rgb.. so i dont think i can convert it just like that for the selector?
[18:31:54] <Whirl3d> da-beginner, isn't #F00 the same as rgb(255,0,0)?
[18:32:39] <da-beginner> yes i think so.. but will jquery understand? :)

[18:32:49] <Whirl3d> Should solve your problems
[18:34:48] <Whirl3d> What is the easy way to select the next item in a group when you are only given one item?
[18:36:47] <da-beginner> Whirl3d: i dont think css() is a selector
[18:37:35] <Whirl3d> it's not. To select it you use $("[color='#F00']");
[18:37:46] <Whirl3d> to apply a color or get the value, use .css
[18:38:08] <Whirl3d> the [prop='val'] selector should work
[18:40:46] <Whirl3d> Wow, where is everyone tonight? This is the most dead I have ever seen this channel. It's kind of creepy.
[18:40:53] <Null_> hey guys, having problems in IE7 & IE8 only (IE9/Chrome/FF all fine) with my ajax content not loading (or at least, not displaying on the page). http://hansandholly.ca/test/#/pages/listing.php?mls=E2131504  I can see that the content is actually returned properly, but something with loading it to #content is not working for some reason.
[18:41:36] <Whirl3d> did you use the {dataType:"html"} option in your ajax call?
[18:42:56] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: .next() should select the next element yes
[18:43:16] <Whirl3d> But if I use an ID selector, what can it return?
[18:43:24] <seancurtis> what do you mean?
[18:43:29] <Whirl3d> $("#item").next()
[18:43:33] <seancurtis> $('#foo') will get #foo
[18:43:43] <seancurtis> and .next() will get the next sibling to #foo
[18:44:35] <Whirl3d> Maybe I need to know what qualifies a sibling...is that anything under the same parent, or just the same class item under the parent?
[18:46:09] <Whirl3d> Simply, I apply the class "current" to my current item and want to select the next item of the same base class to update a header...but there are several dom elements between the "current" item and the "next" item
[18:46:55] <Whirl3d> so, my understanding is that $("#item").next() will return the next dom element under the same parent, which is not what I want
[18:47:10] <seancurtis> what do you want?
[18:47:42] <seancurtis> <ul><li id="foo" /><li id="bar" /></ul> // #foo and #bar are siblings
[18:48:27] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: got some example markup? (create one in jsbin.com or pastie.org if not)
[18:48:45] <buzzman> i can see the room is slow today, but i'd really appreciate if someone took a stab at this really simple issue ... maybe it's a CSS thing, a push in the right direction wud also b a big help   >>>   how do I make the page move when the DIV expands on clicking the "SHOW" link in here:   http://jsfiddle.net/TqMvM/   ...   if you don't see the "SHOW" link, plz scroll down the result window ...
[18:49:24] <Whirl3d> seancurtis, gimme a sec and I'll make a fiddle. Thanks for your help
[18:50:42] <buzzman> seancurtis, can u help with my issue plz ... ?
[18:51:15] <seancurtis> buzzman: page move?
[18:52:00] <buzzman> seancurtis:  umm, is that a jquery command ...?
[18:52:21] <seancurtis> sorry - I mean what do you mean by "make the page move"
[18:52:55] <seancurtis> you want the page to anchor down to it?
[18:53:50] <buzzman> seancurtis:  oh I meant auto scroll the page to the bottom when user clicks the "SHOW" link, cuz the DIV expands below the visible page bottom ... so the user has to manually scroll to the bottom to see the DIV content ...
[18:54:45] <buzzman> seancurtis:  the fiddle has the demo of what i'm trying to explain though ... plz take a looksee ...
[18:55:12] <buzzman> seancurtis:  here:   http://jsfiddle.net/TqMvM/   ...   if you don't see the "SHOW" link, plz scroll down the result window ...
[18:56:05] <buzzman> seancurtis:  then just click on the "SHOW" link and u will see it expands below the visible page bottom ...
[18:57:40] <buzzman> seancurtis:  makes sense now ? or is there something I can pehaps explain more ... ?
[18:57:51] <buzzman> * perhaps
[18:58:37] <seancurtis> buzzman: use http://jsbin.com instead of jsfiddl
[18:58:46] <seancurtis> take a look at this and see if it's what you want: http://jsbin.com/ulikix
[18:58:54] <seancurtis> edit link up top right to see the code
[18:59:48] <buzzman> seancurtis:  ok, thnx a bunch man ... i'm taking a look @ ur link now ...
[19:00:31] <seancurtis> buzzman: advice: 1.) use the href of the links to find the target instead of hardcoding it in your JS 2.) if you have preventDefault it doesn't trigger the browser default behaviour of focusing the page on an anchor - if you don't like the URL changing to match the hash of the link then you'll need to use some plugin to scroll to the target (scrollIntoView is one I think)
[19:06:29] <buzzman> seancurtis:  ok, thnx again and let me wrap my head around that ... i'll apply the code to my project and check back with u in a bit ...
[19:07:43] <da-beginner> still cant find the answer
[19:07:49] <da-beginner> i have this div: <div style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); display: block; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px;">             You are required to select exactly 1 from this group         </div>
[19:07:57] <da-beginner> how do i use a selector to select this div?
[19:08:28] <da-beginner> $('div [style[color: rgb(255,0,0)]'); doesnt work
[19:09:11] <coldhead> seancurtis: i usually tell clients i support everything jQuery supports. then i leave testing to minions
[19:09:39] <coldhead> but ie8+ would be good good times
[19:10:04] <seancurtis> da-beginner: make sure the actual markup has color: rgb(...) in there
[19:10:24] <da-beginner> seancurtis: like how?
[19:10:26] <seancurtis> da-beginner: sometimes Firebug and the other dev tools say it's rgb(...) but in effect it's not
[19:10:29] <seancurtis> view actual source
[19:10:43] <seancurtis> or even better - don't put an inline style - pull it out into a class :)
[19:11:10] <seancurtis> coldhead: some of the refactoring I'm doing is making me giggle like a schoolgirl
[19:11:32] <coldhead> hahahaha you beautiful man
[19:11:55] <da-beginner> seancurtis: so the view source says #ff0000
[19:12:09] <da-beginner> but i still cant call the selector even with that changed
[19:14:59] <rewt> da-beginner, your [] are unbalanced
[19:15:25] <da-beginner> rewt: yes i know that.. but even with it balanced it is still not working :(
[19:15:54] <coldhead> it's not working in a more correct way with balanced []
[19:16:02] <coldhead> which is important
[19:16:23] <rewt> how about that space between div and [
[19:17:27] <rewt> i don't think style[ is right either
[19:17:31] <da-beginner> i've tried $('div[style[color:#ff0000]]')
[19:17:44] <da-beginner> yeah i dont know if it is right or not..
[19:17:50] <seancurtis> coldhead: did a nice little utility column wrapper using display: table/table-cell - checkit: http://jsbin.com/ukahiw
[19:18:03] <rewt> maybe something like $('div[style="color: #ff0000"]')
[19:18:07] <da-beginner> but going straight to color doesn't seem like correct since the item is using style
[19:18:37] <seancurtis> you probably need to use the contains not =
[19:18:53] <rewt> da-beginner, can you add an id to it?
[19:18:55] <seancurtis> if you do style="color: #ff0000" then you have to match exactly that
[19:19:06] <seancurtis> ie anything else in the style attribute will invalidate that selector
[19:19:14] <da-beginner> rewt: no i cant
[19:19:22] <da-beginner> seancurtis: yes there are other attributed
[19:19:37] <da-beginner> <div style="color:#ff0000;display:none;padding-bottom:5px;padding-top:5px;">             You are required to select exactly 1 from this group         </div>
[19:19:52] <seancurtis> da-beginner: can't you apply a class to it?
[19:19:57] <seancurtis> or select it some other way?
[19:20:01] <da-beginner> seancurtis: no i cant :(
[19:20:04] <seancurtis> is this CSS or jquery you're using>
[19:20:14] <da-beginner> because these items are dynamically generated
[19:20:14] <coldhead> this demo is real fine, seancurtis
[19:20:23] <da-beginner> seancurtis: jquery
[19:20:24] <seancurtis> coldhead: :D
[19:20:43] <coldhead> and all the better because i can't test in IE at the moment
[19:20:46] <rewt> maybe something like $('div[style*="color:#ff0000"]')
[19:20:50] <coldhead> so i'll never even know
[19:21:40] <da-beginner> rewt: it returns an error:  TypeError: z.indexOf is not a function { message="z.indexOf is not a function",  more...}
[19:21:41] <Whirl3d> seancurtis, here is an example of where .next and .prev don't work for what I am doing: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/T2bR7/9/
[19:22:03] <seancurtis> da-beginner: try $('div[style^="color:#ff0000;"]');
[19:22:26] <seancurtis> coldhead: that demo works in IE8+ :D
[19:22:40] <da-beginner> seancurtis: still the same error on z.indexOf
[19:22:51] <coldhead> suuure it does
[19:22:54] <coldhead> sup SpinachHead
[19:23:02] <seancurtis> da-beginner: try *= instead of ^=
[19:23:11] <SpinachHead> hi coldhead
[19:23:24] <seancurtis> coldhead: trusssssssst me heh
[19:23:31] <coldhead> hahahah okay :)
[19:23:31] <da-beginner> seancurtis: i did. it gave the z.indexOf error
[19:24:36] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: can't really understand what you're doing there but try .nextAll('.class') instead o
[19:24:37] <rewt> da-beginner, which jquery version?
[19:25:12] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: actually .nextAll('.item')[0]
[19:25:15] <Whirl3d> seancurtis, nextAll('class') doesnt' work because class is getting adulterated by styles and/or 'current' class.
[19:25:23] <da-beginner> rewt: 1.1.2 or 1.2 sth haha
[19:25:27] <rewt> upgrade?
[19:25:52] <Whirl3d> I think it's something like: $("#item_1 + *); or something to select the next...
[19:26:18] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: explain in plain english what you want the behaviour to be?
[19:26:45] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: eg: "The next div with class foo"
[19:27:17] <Whirl3d> seancurtis, I don't know "class foo"--that's the problem. This is being setup where the base class isn't known
[19:27:33] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: or moreover what are you actually trying to do? just cycle through the divs using the next/prev buttons?
[19:27:58] <seancurtis> just trying to understand what you're trying to achieve :)
[19:28:05] <Whirl3d> yes, but I want the 'next' and 'prev' button text to show the ids of the next and prev items
[19:28:34] <Whirl3d> So, the bigger problem is that this is way simplified. There are tons of classes. So ".item" isn't known
[19:29:36] <Whirl3d> i guess I am just going to initialize the items and store their class name in their data object and use that to select the next and previous
[19:31:44] <Whirl3d> $(".current").siblingsAll("."+$(".current").data("className")).next() seems a little ugly
[19:32:28] <Nuck> Is there some way to serialize a form into JSON?
[19:32:50] <Nuck> Like, having fieldsets turn into objects containing their contained forms?
[19:33:22] <da-beginner> rewt: i cant upgrade
[19:33:34] <rewt> sure you can; think positive!
[19:33:47] <Nuck> lol @ ready
[19:33:50] <Nuck> erm, rewt
[19:34:01] <Nuck> Too many nicks on the nance floor D:
[19:34:05] <rewt> heh
[19:34:34] <da-beginner> rewt: i am not allowed to change, not that i cant
[19:34:53] <rewt> what /can/ you change?
[19:35:20] <Nuck> rewt: His underwear, I hope.
[19:35:27] <seancurtis> Nuck: $('form').serialize()
[19:35:34] <seancurtis> ? serialize
[19:35:35] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[19:36:14] <da-beginner> Nuck: lol
[19:36:21] <da-beginner> rewt: the selector? :)
[19:37:04] <AfroTurf> (selector).attr("myattr") doesn't return true anymore?
[19:37:06] <Nuck> seancurtis: I believe that uses URL encoding
[19:37:15] <Nuck> I need JSON, not x-form-encoded
[19:38:18] <seancurtis> ? serializeArray @ Nuck
[19:38:19] <bot-t> Nuck, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[19:39:00] <Nuck> seancurtis: Still a bit off from what I'd like, but I guess I could iterate over them with that :S Then again, I might as well iterate over the elements myself.
[19:39:26] <seancurtis> Nuck: what doesn't that do?
[19:40:31] <Nuck> seancurtis: That provides an array, I'm talking about a full JSON object, where fieldsets' titles would be turned into the names of objects containing key:value pairs for each form element in it.
[19:40:59] <seancurtis> ah ok - well probably not that hard to write
[19:41:04] <Nuck> Probably not
[19:41:13] <seancurtis> maybe inspect the source for serializeArray and tweak it to your needs?
[19:41:26] <Nuck> I was just hoping that good ol' jQuery might hvae a function
[19:41:52] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky my new monitor is really snazzy
[19:41:52] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[19:42:06] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky also to wiggle
[19:42:06] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[19:42:15] <seancurtis> well considering fieldsets are not mandatory for forms, and depending on which doctype you're using the legend tags may not even be required for them I can see why it wasn't included in jQuery
[19:42:38] <seancurtis> bot-t: tell coldhead to spin in circles
[19:42:38] <bot-t> seancurtis, Okay.
[19:43:09] <da-beginner> ok, another question
[19:43:17] <da-beginner> how to select only a visible div?
[19:43:26] <da-beginner> $('div:visible')?
[19:43:34] <miketaylr> that looks good
[19:43:41] <Nuck> seancurtis: I can see the problems, yeah
[19:44:05] <seancurtis> da-beginner: yeah
[19:45:24] <Nuck> oh schweet did Google roll out the new darker topbar?
[19:45:34] <coldhead> waaay ahead of you, sean
[19:48:14] <Whirl3d> seancurtis, here is an example of how it should work. I just thought there would be an easier way to make this happen: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/EWJt7/15/
[20:04:40] <seancurtis> ARGH why do people keep using jsfiddle - is it just me that hates it?
[20:04:52] <sprezzatura> seancurtis: other options?
[20:04:58] <seancurtis> jsbin.com = win
[20:05:01] <systemfault> seancurtis: Yes, it's just you :/
[20:05:26] <systemfault> jsfiddle is the best because everything is right in front of you.
[20:11:18] <seancurtis> can anyone remember the name of that text editor which was insanely minimal - ie it looked like a pane of transparent glass over your desktop?
[20:28:50] <iszak> seancurtis, notepad++ ?
[20:53:45] <ejo> So I had this horrible nightmare last night: every time I typed $.click() it came out as $.clack() ... I knew what was happening but was unable to correct it somehow.  It just kept happening over and over.
[20:54:12] <ejo> So I tried to write a new .clack() plugin that would be like .click() on steroids... but that didn't work either because there was a river of orange soda in the way
[20:54:27] <iszak> then you realised you could sed and replace all your mistakes?
[20:54:41] <ejo> no, sed didn't exist in that universe and I didn't have time to write it!
[20:55:00] <ejo> either that or I'm not that smart in a dream.
[20:55:09] <buzzman> hi again seancurtis, thnx for the code, but unfortunately it doesn't move the page down when the DIV expands (w/o having white space below which is not desirable in my project) ... so i looked around and found w/o changing any of the existing code, this 1 line of jquery that does what i was after   >>>   $("html,#caja").animate({ scrollTop: $('html,#caja').height() }, "slow");    ...    i've updated the JSFIDDLE code, so you can ta
[20:55:13] <iszak> it doesn't exist but a river of orange soda does?
[20:55:21] * ejo shrugs
[20:55:25] <ejo> nightmare logic
[20:55:38] <iszak> it doesn't sound all that bad? a river of soda after all.
[20:56:23] <buzzman> seancurtis, and now the whole thing works w/o a hiccup in JSFIDDLE ...
[20:56:33] <seancurtis> buzzman: cool
[20:56:54] <buzzman> seancurtis, thnx for the help anyway ...
[20:57:06] <buzzman> seancurtis++
[20:57:40] <devinrolsen> Ok, can anyone tell me why this fails to work in all IE versions? http://jsfiddle.net/rM3ej/3/
[20:57:51] <devinrolsen> Seems to validate just fine on all other browsers.
[20:58:35] <buzzman> seancurtis, did u take a look at it ... ? works like a charm ... :p
[20:58:43] <seancurtis> no
[20:58:58] <seancurtis> old link has gone off the screen
[20:59:09] <buzzman> here again, if u want to:   http://jsfiddle.net/TqMvM/2/
[20:59:20] <seancurtis> I think what you were trying to do and what I thought you were trying to do were 2 different things :)
[20:59:57] <seancurtis> buzzman: that looks like it's doing the exact same thing as before?
[21:00:12] <buzzman> seancurtis:  yep, i think that must be it ... and yes i recall u mentioning anchors ... so ur code was about positioning using anchors i believe ...
[21:01:12] <seancurtis> well I thought you wanted the page to scroll down to where the message was
[21:01:21] <seancurtis> not the message to scroll to the top of the viewport?
[21:02:21] <buzzman> seancurtis:  no sir, it's now pushing the page down so the expanded DIV is automatically visible ... here's the prev FIDDLE (the one i gave u first) that was not doing this >>> http://jsfiddle.net/TqMvM/
[21:03:15] <buzzman> seancurtis:  compare that one with this new updated FIDDLE that solves the problemo >>> http://jsfiddle.net/TqMvM/2/
[21:03:38] <seancurtis> ah ok I see - my browser window was too large to see what was going on
[21:03:43] <buzzman> seancurtis:  do u see now ... ?
[21:03:50] <seancurtis> yeah - sort of like scroll into view
[21:03:55] <seancurtis> (a plugin)
[21:04:17] <buzzman> seancurtis:  yep, but w/o any plugin ... just 1 line of jquery ... :p
[21:04:31] <seancurtis> buzzman: you might want to check it out a bit closer though :)
[21:04:43] <seancurtis> check this one
[21:04:43] <seancurtis> http://jsfiddle.net/TqMvM/3/
[21:04:48] <seancurtis> ie if you have content further down
[21:05:02] <seancurtis> everything goes haywire :) I'll let you fix that though
[21:05:03] <buzzman> seancurtis: here's the code    ...    $("html,#caja").animate({ scrollTop: $('html,#caja').height() }, "slow");
[21:05:14] <seancurtis> yeah - but what happens when you collapse it
[21:05:28] <seancurtis> scroll down in the link I pasted
[21:05:37] <seancurtis> then expand/collapse it :)
[21:05:48] <buzzman> seancurtis: ok gimme a sec plz ...
[21:06:02] <seancurtis> I'd go get the scrollintoview plugin - it catches a lot of the edge cases - it's a much more robust solution
[21:08:22] <buzzman> seancurtis:  ok i see what u mean ... but that problem is ONLY if i have any content below that DIV ... but in my case I don't ... not even a <br /> ...  :-)  ... but i'll definitely bookmark this advise ... cuz in any case of content below the DIV, I may need that plug-in ...  thnx ...
[21:08:44] <buzzman> * advice
[21:17:47] <heshanh> hey guys, with the jq cycle plugin, can i use text with the image? all the examples ive seen use img's inside one div. can i have divs inside the made div and have it cycle through the divs?
[21:42:14] <ryanseddon> Cycle can cycle through anything doesn't need to be an image
[21:47:17] <Davey> Hola, so I have a nested list (<ul><li>Text<ul><li>Text 2.1...., I want to turn this into a nest object of: { node: <li>Text</li>, children: [ {node: <li>Text 2.1</li>, children: [...]}, {node: <li>Text 2.2</li>, children: [...] } ] }
[21:48:13] <Davey> the problem I have is, I have it MOSTLY working, except I always end up with { node: <li>Text</li>, children: [ { node: <ul>, children: [ {node: <li>Text 2.1...
[21:48:26] <Davey> so I have the ULs in there, and I can't see how to recurse, but ignore them in my final stack
[22:15:11] <milardovich> Hello guys
[22:15:38] <milardovich> http://bit.ly/jaR2tU  <-- could somebody help me?
[22:15:41] <milardovich> check the "eventos menu"
[22:18:21] <coldhead> what is problem?
[22:19:25] <milardovich> coldhead: the sub-sub-items don't work
[22:19:28] <milardovich> I mean, it works
[22:19:35] <milardovich> but the menu scroll down
[22:20:07] <milardovich> coldhead: look at "eventos"
[22:20:19] <coldhead> i am looking at it
[22:20:23] <milardovich> than you get another tab which is called "teatro", and then another one called "cine"
[22:20:26] <milardovich> then*
[22:20:45] <coldhead> what do you want it to do?
[22:22:30] <milardovich> coldhead: when I click "teatro" it shouldn't scroll down
[22:23:05] <coldhead> okay, where is the code that controls that menu?
[22:23:09] <coldhead> which file is the JS in?
[22:24:17] <milardovich> wait
[22:24:28] <coldhead> i found it
[22:24:38] <milardovich> http://pastebin.com/13vCAhGj
[22:25:47] <coldhead> try $('#header .menu li').not('.submenu li')
[22:26:21] <milardovich> let's see
[22:26:43] <milardovich> mmm
[22:26:46] <milardovich> no, it doesn't work
[22:26:53] <coldhead> damn
[22:28:57] <milardovich> coldhead: do you have any other ideas?
[22:29:05] <coldhead> i am still looking
[22:29:36] <milardovich> oh! ok :-)
[22:29:39] <anli_> Is there a way to automatically break text that contains a super long word?
[22:29:48] <anli_> I still want that text to have a certain width
[22:30:12] <coldhead> #css, anli_
[22:32:53] <coldhead> milardovich: $('#header .menu > li')
[22:33:06] <coldhead> that as the selective might be part of the solution
[22:33:10] <milardovich> let's see
[22:33:17] <coldhead> selector*
[22:33:41] <milardovich> mmm it still doesn't work :-(
[22:33:57] <coldhead> what's it meant to do again?
[22:34:29] <milardovich> sorry? I didn't understand :-P
[22:35:00] <Assimilater> anyone know a good javascript tutorial for someone with no experience in c++, php or related languages to draw from?
[22:35:26] <ryanseddon> Do have any programming experience>
[22:35:48] <timtamboy> Assim, im going through this now: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[22:35:54] <Assimilater> i do, but i'm trying to teach someone
[22:36:09] <coldhead> Assimilater: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Web_Development
[22:36:16] <Assimilater> and i learned by drawing on experience form C#, c++ and php and w3schools (which i now know is bad)
[22:37:46] <ryanseddon> Assimilater: eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[22:38:13] <Assimilater> thanks
[22:38:44] <ryanseddon> There is also jqfundamentals which is more jQuery specific http://jqfundamentals.com/
[22:41:16] <jaypi> I'm having trouble with a couple (2) jquery functions. They are conflicting with eachother and it seems to only get worse with $.noConflict();
[22:41:18] <coldhead> yeah i'm thinking about learning some jqueries myself
[22:43:18] <jaypi> any suggestions?
[22:46:01] <anli_> jaypi: can you rename those?
[22:46:14] <coldhead> milardovich: i am still trying
[22:46:15] <Nuck> Somebody refresh my mammaries, what's the way to add a function to jQuery elements, and is there some way to apply only to specific elements?
[22:46:18] <Cork> jaypi: noConflict isn't meant to fix jquery function conflicts
[22:46:30] <milardovich> coldhead: oh! thanks! me too!
[22:46:30] <Cork> jaypi: its only meant to help with $ conflicts
[22:46:40] <goodapollo> i want to trigger a js function when someone presses an alphabetic key or the return key. does anyone know how to do this?
[22:52:14] <milardovich> coldhead: I found it!! :D
[22:53:09] <coldhead> show me!
[22:53:14] <coldhead> this is what i got http://paste.pocoo.org/compare/423277/423255/
[22:53:41] <milardovich> http://pastebin.com/wi2kFsdM
[22:54:43] <milardovich> it just doesn't scroll down now xD
[22:55:35] <coldhead> your solution has less code
[22:55:45] <coldhead> but i don't really understand how you want it to work
[22:56:16] <coldhead> but note how i use $(this).find('.sub-menu') instead of $('#' + div_id + 'etc')
[22:56:28] <milardovich> let's see
[22:56:29] <coldhead> using $(this) is much better
[22:58:49] <milardovich> coldhead: it doesn't work :P
[22:59:11] <coldhead> it does what *I* think it is meant to do
[22:59:23] <coldhead> but i don't know what you want
[22:59:50] <milardovich> coldhead: look-> http://bit.ly/jaR2tU
[23:00:32] <coldhead> that page has a javascript syntax error
[23:00:57] <coldhead> "Unexpected end of input"
[23:01:10] <milardovich> let's see
[23:01:11] <coldhead> ignore my code, milardovich, you know what you need better than i do
[23:01:16] <milardovich> ok
[23:01:40] <coldhead> sorry, my english is not very good
[23:01:45] <coldhead> and it is my first day using jQuery
[23:02:02] <milardovich> coldhead: no problem, thanks anyway ;)

[23:22:54] <arj27> Hi all! Can you help? I have html like that http://pastebin.com/4FcgWY62. How i can get inputs in #school_tabs but not in .address ?
[23:23:07] <juha___> wangdoo: what sort of scrolling problem do you have?
[23:24:08] <larzen> question - how do I remove an Item from an object?

[23:24:47] <djQuery> gues I will live with it for a little while and see how I like ff5
[23:25:39] <Cork> djQuery: hang in there for a few weeks and you will run ff6 ;)
[23:26:24] <coldhead> wangdoo: don't be so rude
[23:26:34] <coldhead> juha___ doesn't mean you harm
[23:26:41] <coldhead> he is from a cold and brutal land
[23:26:43] <juha___> yeah, i'm finnish
[23:27:13] <juha___> fuck you is our way of saying nice to meet you, after that we usually either stab or get stabbed
[23:27:18] <juha___> welcome to finland
[23:27:30] <Cork> heh
[23:27:41] <juha___> or then it's just me
[23:28:12] <gar_onn> it's just you
[23:31:26] <juha___> hmm, google has rolled out bunch of ui changes
[23:34:26] <thomedy> does any one know much about canvas html5's canvas tag... my line is shotty and off the cursor a bit.. andim not sure why i can pastebin it if you would like
[23:35:16] <Whirl3d> somebody told me the best way to select the "next" item using css selectors that looked like $(".someclass +     but I can't remember the rest. Any ideas?
[23:37:11] <farinspace> $('.someclass').next()
[23:37:30] <farinspace> as in sibling
[23:38:23] <Whirl3d> farinspace, thx for the reply, but that's not what I am looking for. There's another way, where the selector has a '+' in it and it solved a problem I was having that .next() and .siblings() or .siblingsAll() doesn't fix
[23:43:53] <sprezzatura> can someone help me with this : http://jsfiddle.net/zExRr/1/  the hidden var value is not  being set!
[23:45:52] <sprezzatura> darn! missed the name!
[23:46:17] <harvey> hey, who can i speak to regarding a problem?
[23:47:07] <seancurtis> harvey: just ask - if people are free to help, they will reply
[23:47:11] <harvey> ok
[23:47:39] <harvey> im using post ui tabs, and im trying to put 2 columns inside one of the tabs, ive succeeded in getting the format i want, however the tab no longer encloses the image+text
[23:48:21] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: you can use .foo + .bar but that only works when they immediately follow one another
[23:48:31] <harvey> this is the html code im using:
[23:48:51] <harvey> <div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
[23:48:51] <harvey> <img src=http://xxxx.com/image />
[23:48:51] <harvey> </div>
[23:48:51] <harvey> <div style="float: right; width: 40%;">
[23:48:51] <harvey> text text text
[23:48:52] <harvey> </div>
[23:48:52] <seancurtis> harvey: don't paste it in here
[23:48:55] <harvey> oh
[23:48:55] <harvey> sry
[23:48:59] <seancurtis> ? pastie
[23:48:59] <bot-t1> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:49:08] <harvey> ah ok
[23:49:33] <seancurtis> harvey: look up clear floats - you need to clear the div that contains the markup you just pasted
[23:49:52] <seancurtis> I use overflow: hidden as a clearing method but there are some downsides to that (and to the other methods)
[23:50:35] <harvey> ok ill give it a shot
[23:50:35] <harvey> thanks
[23:52:54] <Whirl3d> seancurtis, thnks. I can't believe I lost an entire hard drive--I had this script working the other day and it was about 1/3 of the code. grrr.
[23:52:59] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/EWJt7/18/
[23:55:08] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: ok I'm just about to leave work so I'll give this another look - put just the markup/css in a fiddle and then tell me the behaviour you want
[23:56:04] <Whirl3d> seancurtis, thanks for your help. I've got it worked out the long way. Enjoy your day at work. Don't waste your time on this. Thanks again, though
[23:56:11] <seancurtis> nah cmon
[23:56:13] <juha___> i feel like this cat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T5xg57C-BA
[23:56:13] <seancurtis> go go
[23:56:20] <seancurtis> lemme tweak it before I go home :)
[23:56:30] <seancurtis> waiting for the rain to pass anyway
[23:57:28] <lijzz> does some body have any control to display images? i want to display images from xml file 3 at a time with navigate buttons. the first and 3rd should be dim
[23:57:57] <seancurtis> lijzz: maybe try google for some image gallery scripts?
[23:58:16] <lijzz> i saw some
[23:58:35] <lijzz> but i want some thing like this http://bangaloretoons.com/greendragon/
[23:59:16] <lijzz> seancurtis have you seen some thing like that
[23:59:42] <seancurtis> no - but it wouldn't be hard to code - do you have someone there that knows JS?
[23:59:48] <new2jq> Hello guys...
