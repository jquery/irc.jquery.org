[00:00:47] <frank_o> Cork: wow that is pretty
[00:01:08] <frank_o> how to thank you man. thank you so much :)
[00:01:15] <Cork> np :)
[00:01:29] <Cork> frank_o: do you understand what happens?
[00:01:54] <frank_o> i think so, your solution is very simple and self-explanatory
[00:02:05] <frank_o> ive never seen css been used that way before though
[00:02:11] <Cork> ya, it is a bit tinkery if you want to add more images though
[00:02:35] <Cork> as the delay for each image is controlled by percent of the full animation
[00:02:54] <frank_o> aaah
[00:03:03] <frank_o> will add that to the comments, definitely
[00:03:07] <Cork> so the first image is shown for 35% of 8 seconds
[00:03:26] <Cork> then animate for 15%
[00:04:51] <Cork> WOOPS i missed the debug background-color: red
[00:04:55] <Cork> you can remove that one
[00:05:32] <frank_o> haha
[00:10:41] <timh> hmm
[00:11:26] <timh> if i add a javascript to make my draggable images, also be resizable, the height & width both get set to 0. if i make them resizable in the console, that does not happen
[00:21:14] <jarco_> is it possible to animate changing the source of n image?
[00:22:06] <Lebbe> jarco_: I'll put something up for you on jsfiddle
[00:22:21] <jarco_> wow thx
[00:25:06] <Cork> jarco_: browsers are working on adding support for exactly that
[00:25:19] <Cork> but for now you need to fiddle your self to do it
[00:28:02] <jarco_> nice
[00:28:29] <jarco_> The only other option I can think of is actually prepending and crossfading a nesw img element
[00:28:31] <Cork> so firefox -no-remote -P <profile name>
[00:28:40] <Cork> opps wrong channel
[00:28:45] <jarco_> :)
[00:29:16] <Cork> jarco_: ya, that is what you need to do for now
[00:29:36] <Cork> basically you add the image ontop with opacity: 0
[00:29:43] <Cork> then animate it to opacity 1
[00:29:47] <Cork> and remove the old image
[00:31:21] <jarco_> Yeah i had something in mind like that. Only I also need to support ie8 So I will have to figure a way around that :)
[00:31:37] <Cork> opacity works in ie8
[00:31:53] <Cork> so i don't see the problem >_>
[00:32:29] <Cork> hmm no right
[00:32:33] <Cork> you use filter in ie8
[00:32:49] <Cork> filter: alpha(opacity=);
[00:33:00] <Cork> (ugg man i hate ie...)
[00:33:10] <Cork> weöö old ie
[00:33:20] <Cork> *well
[00:51:13] <Lebbe> woha we had a stand-up
[00:51:17] <Lebbe> got disturbed
[00:51:56] <Lebbe> jarco_: http://jsfiddle.net/lebbe/hw8maxL1/1/
[00:54:41] <jarco_> taking a look now
[00:54:55] <jarco_> very funny!
[00:54:55] <jarco_> :)
[00:57:19] <ocmnt> jarco_ what do you mean by animate the change of an image source?
[00:57:38] <ocmnt> fading in/out image at the same time?
[01:01:31] <Cork> ocmnt: ya we talked about it if you scroll up a bit
[01:03:07] <ocmnt> ah I see, you came across the crossfadingoption already
[01:19:47] <wa5ted> anyone talented at wp
[01:20:31] <Uhkis> people at #wordpress should be
[01:26:10] <moolen> what you mean by talented? Oo
[01:41:03] <anli> Why are thumbs on http://anders.v3net-dev.100procent.com/galleri blurred?
[01:41:15] <anli> Cant find a reason, looking at the css
[01:41:21] <anli> Maybe its a #css question
[01:42:24] <anli> Oh, I know why, they are stretched
[02:43:08] <lobbin> I have a problem related from upgrading jQM to 1.4. The padding-top is removed from the active page when a popup dom is removed
[03:16:50] <heythere> Hey there, is there any way or plugin or something or an example on how I can do something like this http://www.beoplay.com/products/beolit12#at-a-glance ... if you see the scroll from top to a section or something
[03:17:24] <swahili> Q: can I change the context of `this`  using $(document).trigger('fooEvent') ? $(document).on(`fooEvent`, function(){  Change `this` context  }). is it possible ?
[03:18:08] <swahili> this wouldn't work, but let's say $(document).trigger('fooEvent').call($element)
[03:21:18] <Cork> swahili: so you want trigger to not fire on document?
[03:21:33] <Cork> why not just do $element.trigger?
[03:22:28] <swahili> Cork: thanks for looking! Yeh, I'd like to scroll to $(this).offset().top, so if I could change context I could reuse this helper function anywhere.
[03:22:43] <swahili> At the moment I've got a global variable where I set the context, and if set that's why I use
[03:22:48] <Cork> swahili: you can't do it like that
[03:22:56] <swahili> But was wondering, If Icould do it differenttly :)
[03:22:58] <Cork> define the function as a named function and so
[03:23:01] <swahili> Cork: ok, cool :)
[03:23:13] <Cork> $(document).on('fooEvent', name)
[03:23:18] <Cork> and $(element).on('fooEvent', name)
[03:23:34] <Cork> swahili: .call works but it won't trigger the event handler bond on document
[03:23:45] <Cork> as you effectively tell jquery to use a different element
[03:23:53] <Cork> so it will fire on that element
[03:24:19] <Cork> swahili: that said, if the fooEvent uses event.target instead of this
[03:24:31] <Cork> your code would work $(element).trigger('fooEvent')
[03:24:34] <Cork> as event bubbles
[03:25:37] <swahili> Cork: oww! interesting, nice tip :) I'll try it!!
[03:28:30] <swahili> Cork: what a great tip! thanks a lot :D
[03:28:37] <Cork> heh np
[03:57:26] <xgeek> Hello all, i want execute a function whenever the client click on a 'th' elements
[03:57:57] <xgeek> jQuery('th').click(function(){ blablabla }); don't work
[04:02:25] <Cork> xgeek: is the th element added dynamically?
[04:02:37] <xgeek> Cork, yes
[04:02:46] <Cork> then you need to delegate the event handler
[04:02:59] <Cork> as $('th') won't find them as they don't exist when the selector runs
[04:03:09] <xgeek> Cork, how?
[04:03:16] <Cork> on has a delegation syntax
[04:03:22] <Cork> you can read more about delegation in
[04:03:30] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.com delegate
[04:03:32] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:03:36] <xgeek> thanks man
[04:03:40] <Cork> np
[04:04:53] <xgeek> so i use on or delegate or both are the same?
[04:07:25] <thaifood> hi, is there a validator that works for HTML4 and 5?  I still have to support IE9
[04:07:35] <dokma> must be missing something obvious? http://pastebin.com/zzFrdgDb
[04:08:10] <Cork> thaifood: html5 doesn't exist, and html is backwards compatible
[04:08:21] <Cork> thaifood: you might need to pollyfill things though
[04:08:24] <dokma> can't figure out why $('*[data-originalValue="277280-edxxwe.doc"]'); selects nothing...
[04:08:42] <thaifood> what do you mean html5 doesn't exist
[04:08:44] <Cork> thaifood: and for a ie compatible validator check jquery.validator
[04:08:46] <funnybunny> dokma: http://api.jqueryui.com/data-selector/
[04:08:50] <Cork> thaifood: html5 is marketing
[04:08:51] <funnybunny> wrong selector
[04:08:54] <Cork> the spec if "html"
[04:09:01] <dokma> tx!
[04:09:10] <Cork> ?g whatwg html spec
[04:09:11] <b-ot> Cork: HTML Standard - WhatWG â†’ http://www.whatwg.org/html
[04:09:15] <funnybunny> de nada
[04:09:36] <thaifood> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5
[04:09:43] <Cork> thaifood: basically html5 is marketing for "new and nifty things"
[04:09:58] <thaifood> but it does exist
[04:10:06] <dokma> funnybunny, can this select elements with specific value under a key?
[04:10:12] <Cork> including hardware acceleration, h264, webgl css3 and so on
[04:10:20] <thaifood> thanks, i'll look at jquery.validator
[04:10:21] <dokma> it seems to me that it cannot
[04:10:24] <Cork> in a technical question is means nothing
[04:10:31] <Cork> or everything
[04:10:33] <Cork> your choice :)
[04:10:44] <funnybunny> dokma: you will have to write a wrapper for that
[04:10:45] <Cork> thaifood: like i said html5 is marketing
[04:11:08] <thaifood> so it does exist
[04:11:29] <Cork> yes but it doesn't mean anything if you want to talk about implementation limitations
[04:11:40] <thaifood> i see
[04:11:47] <Cork> it is like going to a car manufacuer an "i want a hyper car"
[04:11:51] <funnybunny> dokma: findByDataValue() { $(":data('mykey')").each(function() { if($(this).data('mykey') === 'myvalue') return $(this); });
[04:11:51] <Cork> it doesn't mean anything
[04:11:57] <funnybunny> dokma: something along these lines
[04:12:13] <xgeek> Cork, the whole table is added dynamically... how can i handle click event on th element?
[04:12:13] <dokma> ok
[04:12:17] <dokma> thank you
[04:12:22] <funnybunny> oh.. the return probably won't work.. for obvious scoping reasong :)
[04:12:25] <Cork> thaifood: html5 is used for the layman to speak about the web after it was getting out of the ie6 era
[04:12:37] <Cork> but is is extreamly fuzzy
[04:12:40] <funnybunny> dokma: i am sure you'll figure it out :)
[04:12:48] <xgeek> $('body').on('th', 'click', function....) doesn't work
[04:12:51] <funnybunny> dokma: or use an attribute instead
[04:12:55] <Cork> xgeek: find a stable parent
[04:12:59] <thaifood> i'm very fuzzy too !
[04:13:20] <Cork> thaifood: ya, but in the context of your question the question isn't possible to answer
[04:13:42] <funnybunny> dokma: if you are not storing objects or functions, but just a string you might just as well use prop() or attr()
[04:13:44] <thaifood> i see, well i'm trying to get validation working for IE9 and up
[04:13:44] <Cork> xgeek: body is normally a bad choice though just use $(document) if you need to go that far up
[04:14:09] <thaifood> i shoudl try this yes?  http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[04:14:17] <Cork> xgeek: also on('th', 'click') is the wrong syntax
[04:14:24] <Cork> its on('event', 'target')
[04:14:32] <Cork> not target, event
[04:15:12] <xgeek> still don't work
[04:15:19] <xgeek> $(document).on('click', 'th',function () {
[04:15:19] <xgeek>     alert($(this));
[04:15:19] <xgeek> });
[04:15:22] <Cork> thaifood: yes that is the most commonly used one
[04:15:37] <thaifood> thanks Cork
[04:15:44] <Cork> xgeek: please don't paste multiple code lines in the channel
[04:15:55] <Cork> xgeek: but yes that should work
[04:16:09] <Cork> xgeek: could you try reproducing the problem in jsfiddle.net ?
[04:16:32] <xgeek> Cork, thanks it works now :)) i had to clear the cache
[04:16:34] <xgeek> thanks man
[04:17:22] <Cork> np

[04:20:05] <RiskyShenanigan> http://jsfiddle.net/op7905su/ - is there a reason why within the FizzBuzz test, checking modulo 3 and 5 has to be first in the if statement?
[04:20:42] <dokma> funnybunny, I find this way a lot shorter and concise: http://jsfiddle.net/cse_tushar/NT7jf/
[04:20:47] <dokma> but can't get it to work...
[04:22:11] <funnybunny> dokma: replace ' with " and vice versa
[04:22:25] <funnybunny> http://jsfiddle.net/NT7jf/41/
[04:22:44] <dokma> no... the fiddle works
[04:22:59] <dokma> but I can't get it to work on data attribute set via .data('key')
[04:23:06] <dokma> let me make a fiddle
[04:23:23] <funnybunny> right.. that's because stuff set via data() doesn't show up as data attributes
[04:23:42] <dokma> oh, I see
[04:24:31] <funnybunny> i told you this before.
[04:26:08] <heythere> is there an easy way to do something like fullpage.js does, just for 1 div?
[04:27:15] <Cork> heythere: not sure what "fullpage.js" does
[04:27:24] <Cork> but are you talking about requestFullscreen?
[04:27:29] <Cork> ?g mdn requestFullscreen
[04:27:31] <b-ot> Cork: Element.requestFullscreen - Web API Interfaces | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.requestFullScreen
[04:28:20] <heythere> cork i got a fullscreen slider on top, and i just want when a user is scrolling down to skip it and autoscroll to the next section of the site or div
[04:28:49] <Cork> heythere: i suspect you mean slideshow right?
[04:28:59] <heythere> yes
[04:29:15] <RiskyShenanigan> how do I increment a single characters e.g. "#", "##"?
[04:29:47] <heythere> let me rephrase it: I got a Fullscreen Div, and I want when the user scrolls down to autoscroll to the next div :)
[04:29:51] <Cork> heythere: that doesn't really have anything to do with fullscreen, just bind the scroll event and do your adjustments
[04:29:57] <Cork> RiskyShenanigan: increment?
[04:30:24] <RiskyShenanigan> I mean concatanate a hash each time through a for loop
[04:30:42] <Cork> s += "#";
[04:30:56] <heythere> cork do you have any example that I can start off? I've researched it quite a long time, doesnt seem to find the correct words are. This is the effect I want : http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#firstPage
[04:31:15] <Cork> heythere: not really
[04:31:24] <Cork> bind the event and check scrollTop
[04:31:46] <Cork> if it isn't aligned with the element move it to the closest downwoards
[04:31:56] <Cork> possible with a threshold
[04:33:34] <heythere> hmm Cork I am a bit lost <; hehe
[04:33:52] <Cork> heythere: ok?
[04:34:41] <heythere> so div.bind({ if scrolltop { go to div}}) something like that?
[04:34:47] <Cork> no
[04:34:59] <Cork> the scroll event happens on the element that is scrolling
[04:35:12] <Cork> so if you don't have an element with overflow: auto or scroll
[04:35:18] <Cork> that would make that the document
[04:35:53] <heythere> ok thanks ill look a bit more into it :)

[04:44:29] <Cork> ?ask
[04:44:29] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:45:05] <thaifood> Cork: i'm confused, i want to manually validate a single date field for required, and a valid date in formate mm-dd-yyyy.  I have this in y button click listener but where do i put the rules?  var validator = $( "#application" ).validate();  validator.element( "#dob" );
[04:45:56] <Cork> thaifood: you normally set rules in the validate function
[04:46:24] <lemonsparrow> hi
[04:46:36] <thaifood> ok
[04:51:02] <thaifood> Cork: it's alive !
[04:52:58] <thaifood> dead in IE9 though :-(
[04:53:12] <yowkah> Im building a responsive website with skelJS framework + jquery 2.1.1  i can't seem to replicate it in the JSfiddle but i'll show you the code anyways. http://jsfiddle.net/1L0judj1/1/      What happens is: i want the div with the inner class to always be on the center of the page. but when i place it in a function that is triggered on resize, the initial results are different ( the padding has 20px more on both sides in my case). Does anyo
[04:53:25] <Cork> thaifood: check for trailing commas, that is a quite common problem in ie
[04:53:25] <thaifood> it shows the "Please enter a valid date" in FF but not IE9
[04:54:35] <thaifood> weird, now it's working
[04:54:43] <thaifood> must have had the page cached
[04:54:54] <thaifood> whew
[04:55:12] <thaifood> good point about trailing commas too !
[04:55:23] <thaifood> i'm so glad you are here
[05:02:01] <thaifood> Cork, does this make sense to you?  I'm not getting any format validation for date.  http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-validate-date-birth-format-dd-mm-yy/
[05:02:59] <sha1sum> Good day everybody. I've been struggling on what search terms to use for a certain animation effect that some of you may have seen before... I'm looking for a way to "deal" a bunch of divs from the top of the screen into place like a deck of cards.
[05:03:15] <Cork> thaifood: i'm not very knowledgeable about the validation plugin
[05:03:21] <sha1sum> (when I search for "jquery animation deal cards" I get a lot of howtos about making card games)
[05:03:27] <thaifood> ok
[05:03:41] <thaifood> supposedly simple things elude me
[05:04:10] <Cork> thaifood: http://jqueryvalidation.org/date-method/ ?
[05:04:40] <Cork> oh
[05:04:47] <Cork> they recommend NOT to use it ^^'
[05:05:03] <thaifood> what to use ?
[05:05:20] <thaifood> dateISO i see
[05:05:21] <thaifood> hmm
[05:05:29] <thaifood> the rabbit hole deepens
[05:05:49] <sha1sum> dang rabbit
[05:05:50] <Cork> lol
[05:06:12] <sha1sum> where's elmer when you need him?
[05:06:28] <thaifood> bwasted wabbit
[05:07:24] <yowkah> can someone help me with this problem? details in comments at the fiddle:   http://jsfiddle.net/pw5tu9et/
[05:07:41] <thaifood> dateISO doesn't give me any validation.  crap
[05:13:21] <yowkah> nevermind my question about the differences... firefox auto-reload plugin was screwing me over >.>
[05:16:47] <|DZ|> can any1 tell me why this doesn't work on the second page: http://jsfiddle.net/8o231gpv/
[05:17:21] <|DZ|> why do the form elements have to be visible for the validator to work?  is that the ignore attribute making this happen?
[05:24:45] <yowkah> |DZ| doesn't matter if i click the this does work or this doesn't work button, validator says true in both cases if the form is completely filled.
[05:25:25] <yowkah> |DZ|  aah nevermind, problem is the other way around >.<
[05:26:15] <xgeek> how can i get a menu when i click in something?
[05:26:23] <xgeek> not when the mouse is over it
[05:27:04] <Cork> xgeek: uh, by showing it on click and not mouseenter?
[05:27:26] <Cork> (or context if you mean right mousebutton)
[05:31:48] <yowkah> |DZ|  no experience from me with jquery mobile. but from what the paging does:  doesn't it transition the pages out of view and thus set them to "display:none;"  in css?  in that case it is logical that it doesn't validate them since they are not in play anymore.. in normal html you would use the hidden html attribute to hide fields you don't want visible but still hold value.
[05:32:18] <|DZ|> maybe its the ignore setting in validate
[05:32:26] <|DZ|> i believe its set to ':hidden' selector by default
[05:33:40] <yowkah> i mean the html attribute  type=hidden  for an input field
[05:35:35] <|DZ|> validation's ignore setting defaults to the :hidden selector
[05:35:53] <|DZ|> which is either type=hidden or display none
[05:36:53] <yowkah> found this on stack overflow: From the 1.9.0 Change Log of jQuery Validate:
[05:36:53] <yowkah>         Fixed #189 - :hidden elements are now ignored by default
[05:37:33] <|DZ|> ah
[05:37:42] <|DZ|> yeah ill have to change that
[05:37:45] <|DZ|> that's probably it
[05:37:53] <yowkah> for forms its always wise to set them to "visibility: hidden; position:absolute;" instead of display none. because HTML doesn't send form elements that have been set to display none, just so you know :)
[05:38:16] <|DZ|> ah
[05:38:20] <|DZ|> thx man!
[05:38:25] <yowkah> yw :P
[05:39:32] <lolmaus> I need to generate a bunch of HTML elements and add them into the page. I assume that doing it one-by-one is slow. Is there a faster way to do that? E. g. generate them into a collection, then append the collection into the page?
[05:40:01] <|DZ|> id generate them as one big var
[05:40:10] <|DZ|> then append the var to whatever container you need them in
[05:40:24] <|DZ|> adding one by one elements isnt as efficient as adding them in one fell swoop
[05:51:38] <thaifood> Why would jquery validation error on 12-22-2000 with dateISO: true ?
[05:52:07] <thaifood> or any date in that format
[05:52:47] <thaifood> aw nvm i got another way
[05:59:19] <Cork> thaifood: cause the iso standard is yyyy-mm-dd not mm-dd-yyyy
[06:00:46] <thaifood> ok, thanks, now i'm stuck on radio buttons :-(
[06:00:58] <thaifood> it can't get any simpler and still doesn't work

[06:03:03] <thaifood> oh wait
[06:03:04] <thaifood> doh
[06:03:15] <elmcrest> anyone here who can help me with datatables? F.e. I'd like to add a css class to my table cells - the complete table definiton comes from a json object.
[06:08:32] <thaifood> Is there a way to use validator.element on radio buttons? I have two with name="gender" but different ids.
[06:08:44] <thaifood> i'm trying to set required
[06:09:49] <elmcrest> hmm sometimes googeling after posting a question magically brings the solution :) ... for css classes for the table cells just add sClass to your aoColumns definition :)
[06:23:10] <thaifood> Anyone know how to validate radio buttons?  line 29 please.  Fix it and win a prize !  http://laravel.io/bin/vka1K
[06:24:40] <Cork> thaifood: your radio buttons are invalid
[06:24:45] <Cork> you don't have any values in them
[06:25:08] <Cork> you only have type, name and id
[06:25:34] <thaifood> hmm
[06:25:35] <darkfrog> if I want to position an absolute positioned element underneath an element on the screen, how do I get the absolute position for that element?  I've been doing (instance.offset().top + instance.outerHeight()) but that doesn't account for scrolling offset
[06:26:00] <Cork> darkfrog: .position()
[06:26:07] <thaifood> won't they get a value when they are clicked ?
[06:26:18] <Cork> no they bet checked="checked"
[06:26:23] <Cork> bet==get
[06:26:53] <Cork> <input type="radio" name="gender" checked="checked"> is still value=""
[06:27:23] <darkfrog> Cork: position just gives me relative to the offset parent...I need the absolute document position
[06:27:39] <Cork> thaifood: what you want is  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female">
[06:27:47] <thaifood> sec boss is bugging me !
[06:27:55] <Cork> darkbasic: so .offset() then
[06:28:04] <Cork> (yes i know the names is reversed...)
[06:28:12] <Cork> is=are
[06:28:31] <darkfrog> Cork: that's what I'm using (as stated in my preliminary question) but it doesn't account for scrolling offset
[06:28:41] <Cork> darkfrog: but absolute is also positioned to the offset parent
[06:29:01] <Cork> darkfrog: it does
[06:29:05] <darkfrog> hmmm...perhaps that's my problem
[06:29:40] <Cork> darkfrog: fixed is positioned in relation to the viewport
[06:32:09] <jen_> I am using Bootstrap framework and this is driving me crazy: http://pastebin.com/NGTX3a2v
[06:33:03] <jen_> I am using Bootstrap framework and this is driving me crazy: http://pastebin.com/NGTX3a2v
[06:33:33] <Lope> $('.foo')[0] get's me the javascript object for that element. but what if I want a jquery object of that element? is there a better way than $($('.foo')[0]) ?
[06:34:51] <decx> wat
[06:35:36] <decx> $('.foo').eq(0) will get you the first element in that collection
[06:35:51] <_rgn> $('.foo:first')
[06:36:50] <Cork> Lope: [0] gives you the dom element not a javascript object
[06:37:02] <decx> i will write $($('.foo')[0]) in my diary next to $(this)[0]
[06:39:32] <dmsuperman> hahah decx
[06:39:59] <dmsuperman> Lope: the real question is what do you need to get only the first item for specifically? Many jquery functions when given a collection will automatically act on the first element
[06:40:04] <dmsuperman> so you may not even need to do anything
[06:41:23] <VectorX> can someone tell me why the mobile/responsive dropdown is not working here http://bit.ly/1pe3Gfj  its the icon with the three lines on the top right when you make the browser smaller
[06:46:02] <Lope> okay, thanks. eq is what I needed. I need to act on each at diff times. so .eq() does the job perfectly, thanks.
[07:01:50] <Lope> are jquery selector's live or static?
[07:01:55] <Lope> seems to be static?
[07:02:02] <BillCriswell> Static.
[07:02:17] <basiclaser> hey guys, how would i iterate to split every third element from this array? http://jsbin.com/yuzadu/2/
[07:02:25] <Lope> and if I run the selector again I'll get the DOM nodes in the same DOM order?
[07:02:39] <Lope> so I can just refresh my selector?
[07:03:05] <Lope> is there a method to refresh a selector?
[07:03:45] <Lope> okay, google. a = $(a.selector);
[07:04:40] <basiclaser> i just want to remove the zeros :P http://jsbin.com/yuzadu/2/
[07:07:23] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: Which ones?
[07:07:24] <basiclaser> ah i got it
[07:07:35] <basiclaser> no worries
[07:09:45] <basiclaser> BillCriswell: but i have another question for you, how would i format the elements in that array into pairs, mini-arrays?
[07:12:20] <BillCriswell> like [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5],...] ?
[07:12:48] <basiclaser> BillCriswell: yeh :)
[07:13:40] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8495687/split-array-into-chunks
[07:19:03] <basiclaser> BillCriswell: thanks bob
[07:19:13] <BillCriswell> No prob, Bob.
[07:20:16] <Takumo> Why am I getting a TypeError: 'stepUp' called on an object that does not implement interface HTMLInputElement (jquery.js:9476)
[07:20:58] <Scroll_Tro0l> When I use .parents() to get up to a parent, how do I turn back down and get a grandchild of that?
[07:21:04] <Scroll_Tro0l> Just .children()?
[07:21:38] <dmsuperman> Scroll_Tro0l: or .find
[07:21:57] <dmsuperman> Scroll_Tro0l: you're trying to find a cousin of an element?
[07:22:27] <Scroll_Tro0l> No, more like an uncle
[07:22:48] <Scroll_Tro0l> a removed one :P
[07:25:31] <Scroll_Tro0l> dmsuperman: .find was exactly what I needed, thanks!
[07:25:48] <AdamPDotty> getting the family together
[07:25:59] <BillCriswell> .find() would go as deep as you need.
[07:28:02] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: unnngh
[07:28:25] <Lope> how can I fill an array with $('.foo').text() ?
[07:28:27] <BillCriswell> Haha
[07:28:40] <BillCriswell> Lope: $.map
[07:28:44] <BillCriswell> or loop through them.
[07:29:12] <AdamPDotty> [$('.foo').text()]
[07:29:37] <Lope> AdamPDotty: not like that. one array element per DOM element.
[07:30:46] <Lope> I just thought there might be some fancy jquery trick, instead of looping. I'd rather loop than map.
[07:31:20] <BillCriswell> Lope: Why?
[07:31:21] <decx> nothing tricky about map it's exactly what you want
[07:32:18] <BillCriswell> Lope: http://jsbin.com/tuqesucenuti/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:32:41] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/tuqesucenuti/2/edit
[07:32:44] <BillCriswell> forgot the .get()
[07:32:49] <dmsuperman> it's no fun to give them the answers!
[07:33:15] <decx> why get?
[07:33:18] <BillCriswell> j/k that's not the answer.
[07:33:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Doesn't that make it like a regular array instead of some jquery thingie?
[07:33:47] <BillCriswell> See how techincaly I can get.
[07:34:02] <decx> map always makes an array
[07:34:10] <BillCriswell> jQuery.map ?
[07:34:15] <decx> yea
[07:34:41] <BillCriswell> It returns a jQuery object doesn't it?
[07:34:48] <dmsuperman> an array of whatever you returned
[07:34:54] <dmsuperman> how else could you get an array of strings
[07:34:58] <dmsuperman> (he wants an array btw)
[07:35:13] <dmsuperman> a jquery collection makes no sense since he wants the strings
[07:35:27] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/tuqesucenuti/3/edit is my train of thought.
[07:35:35] <yowkah> can anyone tell me if this http://jsfiddle.net/g1d60uve/ will cause performance issues with repeated scrolling? because it calls the events every time you scroll? if so, how do i work around this? :P
[07:35:39] <thaifood> I modified the radio buttons but don't know how to call the validator on them?  http://laravel.io/bin/JGOzQ
[07:35:54] <thaifood> see line 30
[07:36:14] <AdamPDotty> $.map($('.foo'), function(a){return $(a).text();})
[07:36:26] <dmsuperman> why do you need to call the validator on the buttons thaifood?
[07:36:31] <dmsuperman> you just call it on the form and define the rules
[07:36:49] <dmsuperman> yowkah: you could debounce it
[07:36:56] <dmsuperman> !google javascript debounce
[07:36:57] <b-ot> dmsuperman: JavaScript Debounce Function - David Walsh â†’ http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[07:37:12] <dmsuperman> or I guess maybe jquery has a debounce
[07:37:15] <BillCriswell> decx: I was using $('.foo').map and not $.map($('.foo')), my mistake.
[07:37:27] <thaifood> dmsuperman:  i need to validate it on a button click
[07:37:33] <thaifood> before the form is sumitted
[07:37:37] <decx> makes no difference afaik BillCriswell
[07:37:39] <dmsuperman> thaifood: $('#application').valid()
[07:37:54] <thaifood> i don't want to validate the entire form
[07:38:03] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/ returns array, http://api.jquery.com/map/ returns jQuery
[07:38:19] <thaifood> validator.element is supposed to let me validate individual elements but since i have two radio buttons i guess it can't
[07:38:23] <dmsuperman> then use the element
[07:38:27] <dmsuperman> $('#element').valid()
[07:38:29] <AdamPDotty> decx: I just tried, its true
[07:38:34] <yowkah> dmnsuperman thanks, didnt even know you could abuse timeouts like that. ( for debouncing)
[07:38:35] <decx> but i return arrays with $(el).map all the time?
[07:39:03] <BillCriswell> decx: Might be luck that they work with what you're trying to do? haha
[07:39:09] <BillCriswell> Don't question it now. Keep running with it.
[07:39:14] <thaifood> dmsuperman: but there are two elements to the radio button
[07:39:32] <decx> yowkah cache your nav.height() it's expensive on every scroll
[07:39:36] <dmsuperman> thaifood: well try validating one and see what it gives you
[07:39:42] <dmsuperman> no point theorizing here without trying
[07:39:48] <thaifood> i need the validator to make sure one is checked and if not put the "Please select a Gender" message
[07:40:54] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: It's both
[07:40:56] <thaifood> validating one displays the error message inside the label
[07:41:06] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: it will return a jquery collection if you simply modify the element in your callback
[07:41:19] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell: but if you have a return in the callback, it replaces the element with what you return
[07:41:25] <dmsuperman> so if your callback returns a string you end up with an array of strings
[07:41:35] <thaifood> see http://i.imgur.com/JsC9Cto.png
[07:41:54] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell / decx: However it is still a jquery collection
[07:42:13] <dmsuperman> $('div').map(function() { return 'a'; }).get(0) gets "a" for instance
[07:42:23] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: Right right.
[07:43:22] <decx> intersting
[07:43:24] <decx> e
[07:44:27] <thaifood> Is there now way to manually validate a group of radio buttons with jquery validator ?
[07:44:32] <thaifood> no way
[07:44:50] <decx> i'm watching fish play streetfighter on twitch, what the hell
[07:44:55] <BillCriswell> thaifood: That seems unlikely? What kind of validation? Just... requited?
[07:45:09] <thaifood> yes BillCriswell
[07:45:14] <thaifood> one must be picked
[07:45:16] <dmsuperman> typically the validate plugin is for validating forms
[07:45:24] <dmsuperman> not just one item
[07:45:25] <thaifood> but i need to validate before submitting the form
[07:45:33] <dmsuperman> why's that?
[07:46:01] <thaifood> because i have a form that acts like a wizard with next/prev butttons and hidden /visible sections
[07:46:33] <thaifood> so it's one big form that doesn't submit till the end of filling it out but each next button needs to validate specific elements
[07:46:56] <dmsuperman> you could make all the rules only run if the element is visible and then just validate the entire form
[07:47:06] <dmsuperman> so if page 2 is hidden none of its rules fire
[07:47:13] <thaifood> how can i do that please ?
[07:47:17] <thaifood> that sounds super
[07:47:29] <dmsuperman> define custom rules that check for is(':visible')
[07:47:38] <dmsuperman> I have some like "requiredIfVisible"
[07:47:50] <dmsuperman> and return true if not
[07:47:57] <decx> jq validate does that too
[07:48:03] <dmsuperman> for all of the rules?
[07:48:16] <thaifood> decx how ?
[07:48:28] <decx> everything that is not visible gets ignored
[07:48:34] <thaifood> ahhh
[07:48:46] <thaifood> sounds like my troubles are over
[07:48:54] <thaifood> i'll give it a try and thanks guys
[07:49:05] <liamjfoy> Hello. Iâ€™ve some JSON returned which contains currency symbol, eg, â€˜&#164;â€™ however it prints this as the code, not the symbol. How can I parse it so it displays the currency symbol correctly?
[07:49:12] <uskerine> hi, I have an event handler like this:   $('#table tbody').on( 'focusout', .......
[07:49:25] <uskerine> how could I specifiy within the body that focus will be setup to another element?
[07:49:42] <decx> focusout is a thing?
[07:49:51] <decx> is that like blur for non form elements
[07:50:10] <uskerine> it is a table, without handler the focus moves normally between cells, but with the handler the focus is lost
[07:50:22] <uskerine> focusout is definitivelly a thing and it works
[07:50:33] <uskerine> I would like to know how to set the focus to another element in jquery
[07:50:59] <RiskyShenanigan> to fade to a new color for a square div, is it difficult to implement that with pure JS?
[07:51:07] <dmsuperman> liamjfoy: so you have code that is pritning exactly as it should but you want to convert your HTML entity code into the actual entity?
[07:51:20] <liamjfoy> Yes
[07:51:36] <liamjfoy> itâ€™s going into a select box as &#164;, not the symbol...
[07:51:48] <dmsuperman> as it should
[07:51:56] <dmsuperman> you can use jquery to convert easily
[07:52:05] <thaifood> why won't gender radio buttons validate? A form submit is not required is it?  http://laravel.io/bin/O5ymq
[07:52:06] <dmsuperman> check this out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10715801/javascript-decoding-html-entities
[07:52:10] <liamjfoy> Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m looking to do =) can you guide me?
[07:52:14] <liamjfoy> Excellent thank you.
[07:52:50] <dmsuperman> thaifood: required fields don't validate until they are modified or submitted
[07:52:56] <thaifood> my form is called #application btw
[07:53:20] <thaifood> i thought i could just call $( "#application" ).validate( blah.....
[07:53:26] <thaifood> and invoke it
[07:53:43] <dmsuperman> .validate() just activates teh validator
[07:53:47] <dmsuperman> it doesn't actually trigger validation
[07:53:52] <thaifood> i'm lost
[07:54:11] <thaifood> so the only way to validate is to submit the form ?
[07:54:15] <dmsuperman> no, again
[07:54:19] <dmsuperman> you can modify a field
[07:54:21] <dmsuperman> or submit the form
[07:54:28] <dmsuperman> once you modify a field it starts validating it
[07:54:36] <thaifood> yeah that won't work for me
[07:54:40] <dmsuperman> (this is to avoid the issue of loading a page up with a bunch of error messages)
[07:54:53] <dmsuperman> it makes no sense to validate a field the user hasn't messed with yet
[07:54:54] <thaifood> when they hit next i need it to show that neither radio button was clicked
[07:54:56] <thaifood> and one is required
[07:55:01] <dmsuperman> read the validate docs
[07:55:05] <dmsuperman> for how to trigger validation of the form
[07:55:21] <thaifood> you said it has to change to validate
[07:55:29] <dmsuperman> or you can manually trigger it via js
[07:55:33] <dmsuperman> if the default behavior isn't acceptable
[07:56:13] <thaifood> thanks dmsuperman i see what you mean
[07:57:16] <nonconvergent> Hi.
[07:57:39] <uskerine> how do I select a node which is not in the same tree but in an adjacent one? http://pastebin.com/KDxBxHQi
[07:58:17] <thaifood> dmsuperman: how to avoid the error message IN the label?  http://i.imgur.com/WCMcUDO.png
[07:58:19] <drej> why're you using tables for a form out of curiosity
[07:58:44] <uskerine> it is a tabular form
[07:58:47] <uskerine> with datatables
[07:58:50] <thaifood> isn't it supposed to make a label for the error below the radio button ?
[07:59:16] <ZogDog> Is anyone aware of a good channel for asking design questions or practices?
[08:00:07] <drej> uskerine you can probably use .next()
[08:00:13] <drej> .next('textarea')
[08:00:22] <drej> ZogDog ##frontend or ##design
[08:00:39] <ZogDog> drej: thank you!
[08:00:53] <dmsuperman> uskerine: $(this).parents('tr').find('textarea[name="description"]') is how I would do it
[08:00:59] <dmsuperman> er not parents, closest
[08:01:01] <uskerine> thanks
[08:01:09] <uskerine> closest
[08:01:12] <uskerine> I will use that
[08:01:24] <uskerine> drej i think next wouldn't work without using a closest first
[08:01:26] <drej> dmsuperman do you have to traverse back to parent
[08:01:35] <drej> i guess you would, that makes sense
[08:01:44] <drej> although http://api.jquery.com/next/
[08:01:48] <dmsuperman> I never use .next
[08:01:50] <drej> in the example, it traverses to parent div
[08:01:53] <drej> automagically
[08:01:58] <dmsuperman> My main thing is not wanting to pick the wrong textarea
[08:02:05] <RiskyShenanigan> risky
[08:02:07] <dmsuperman> and not wanting to be restricted by the ordering of nodes
[08:02:28] <dmsuperman> what if the HTML guy moves the textarea up, etc
[08:02:37] <drej> i mean if its important then build the relationship for a fact
[08:02:40] <nonconvergent> So I'm working on an existing project while learning jquery and js for it.  In a jsp it has some js that launches does a check and may display a modal when a button's clicked. I'm trying have it do another check then maybe show modal just before it.  But when I added my changes, neither modal appears even though I've tweaked the backend db entry enough that both should (and I've tested the checks and queries related...they work).
[08:02:53] <drej> <input type="text" rel="idoftextarea">
[08:02:53] <dmsuperman> I agree but sometimes this is what you got :P
[08:02:57] <drej> and then hit the attr(rel)
[08:02:58] <drej> but yeah
[08:03:10] <dmsuperman> I wouldn't really be opposed to either solution
[08:03:59] <drej> [11:02:29]  <dmsuperman>	 what if the HTML guy moves the textarea up, etc
[08:04:03] <drej> those HTML guys always moving shit around!
[08:04:06] * drej shakes a fist
[08:04:10] <Uhkis> :D
[08:04:33] <nonconvergent> https://gist.github.com/nonconvergent/5f82c63c83a19755dc3a Here's the script.  I added customTaxIdValidation and moved the logic for addressValidation into its own function, then put calls to them where the address validation used to go.
[08:04:47] <uskerine> nah, .focus() does not work using that, although the selector is probably the right one
[08:04:48] <drej> ps, we're trying to get a bunch of smart like-minded people up in ##fronted to have discussions such as this, less support more discussions on methodologies, best practices, new tools etc
[08:04:53] <drej> if anyone's interested
[08:04:54] <drej> </spam>
[08:04:56] * drej ducks
[08:05:00] <dmsuperman> drej: lol
[08:05:02] <drej> shh
[08:05:10] <drej> ##frontend * damnit
[08:05:23] <Uhkis> that ed on the front
[08:05:24] <nonconvergent> Any help or love would be appreciated.
[08:05:32] <drej> Uhkis its like special ed
[08:05:35] <drej> but on your front
[08:07:16] <uskerine> drej I am moving simultaneously both html and Jquery code, I wish I would have a HTML guy moving shit around
[08:08:52] <Uhkis> i'd say you're lucky uskerine
[08:09:04] <uskerine> I wouldn't be so sure
[08:09:05] <uskerine> :-D
[08:13:05] <zim> Hi all. I am intercepting an event with event.preventDefault(); then I do stuff now how do I fire the event?
[08:14:33] <nisseni> if I do a method like this: https://gist.github.com/ishareab/7099d834d55be36fe48d - if data is from PHP and is return false; - shouldn't data be false, meaning element should go with hide(); ?
[08:15:49] <zim> nisseni, false is a string so data = true
[08:16:17] <nisseni> zim: ok, what should I return in order for it to behave like false?
[08:16:37] <zim> I would guess at some 40*
[08:19:23] <zim> nisseni, I tend to return JSON so can have an error in the returned data
[08:20:01] <nisseni> zim: yeah, got it :)
[08:23:37] <zim> Anyone got any pointers on my event?
[08:23:57] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/1fz50z1y/31/ Could someone please take a look at this for me. I am really super close. I just can't quite get the formatting correct. Just look at the href of the link at the bottom of the html. Trying to get it to show in this format p195_q2-p134_q1
[08:24:04] <drej> pointer-events: none;
[08:30:54] <zim> drej, what that for me?
[08:31:00] <drej> it was joke
[08:31:05] <drej> css joke.
[08:31:06] <zim> OK
[08:31:16] <drej> jokes are never okay, jquery is serious business
[08:31:24] <zim> LOL
[08:32:11] <zim> drej, IS there a way to fire an event after event.preventDefault();
[08:32:46] <decx> i enjoyed that pointer joke
[08:32:58] <drej> event.preventDefault() should only prevent the default event, it wont stop any other events
[08:33:03] <drej> so you can rebind it if you'd like
[08:33:14] <drej> decx thanks buddy, i knew i could count on you
[08:33:39] <decx> o/
[08:34:02] <zim> I get that. But to save rebuilding the event I was hoping I could event.preventDefault(); do stuff then fire the event
[08:34:45] <zim> A little more detail the event is a form submit I would like to update a hidden field then submit
[08:35:35] <drej> so just do that
[08:35:45] <zim> How?
[08:35:50] <drej> evevent.preventDefault(); /* stuff ehre to populate your thing */ form.sumit();
[08:35:54] <drej> submit*
[08:36:06] <zim> ty wil try
[08:37:36] <zim> so something like this? $(this).closest('form').submit();
[08:38:00] <drej> well, what event are you preventing?
[08:38:20] <zim> So there is no way to utilise  the event its self?
[08:38:31] <drej> there is, but it depends on what youre oding
[08:38:38] <zim> drej, the form submit
[08:38:38] <drej> $(form).submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* stuff here */ $(this).submit(); }
[08:38:41] <drej> )
[08:38:51] <zim> Ah ty
[08:40:38] <zim> drej, Not quite. $('body').on('click', '.send-post', function(event) { so not = to this
[08:40:49] <drej> well dont do that
[08:40:55] <drej> bind it to the submit event of the form instead
[08:40:55] <zim> lol
[08:40:58] <drej> and not a click of a specific button
[08:41:46] <zim> drej, I get that my Q was can I leverage the event guess not
[08:41:57] <drej> no you'd have to find the form and submit it
[08:42:08] <drej> but overall, its better practice to bind it to the event
[08:42:14] <drej> you might not always get a click event fire from that submit button
[08:42:20] <drej> in some cases in IE, if they hit ENTER to submit the form
[08:42:23] <drej> and not click on the button
[08:42:26] <drej> then it wont trigger
[08:42:39] <zim> Ah ok TY
[08:43:10] <dmsuperman> Also if you were to use jquery validate or anything similar it would trigger a submit event not a click event
[08:44:33] <drej> exactly ^
[08:54:28] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning #jquery
[09:00:13] <jftf> I have a simple scrollTo function here: https://gist.github.com/josephdburdick/2d1682cf5bc08ab3af20 Why can't I get scrollTarget.offsetTop when I inspect the object in console it's right there in the list?
[09:00:21] <jftf> oops. lemme pastebin this
[09:01:06] <jftf> Here we are: http://pastebin.com/QJz0fT1b
[09:05:44] <robertmaxrees> can you make a simple fiddle?
[09:16:24] <zim> drej, dmsuperman. OK. now catching the form submit but then if I $(this).submit() it loops :-)
[09:17:24] <robertmaxrees> did you make a fiddle?
[09:17:30] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i do that stuff all the time, zim.
[09:18:24] <basiclaser> hey guys how can i style a javascript prompt box?
[09:18:34] <zim> fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/sq5hdtxj/
[09:18:35] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser you can't.
[09:18:45] <basiclaser> i need to prevent users from selecting and copying text in the prompt
[09:19:01] <basiclaser> in the message, not that actual input field
[09:19:34] <robertmaxrees> zim yeah so you need to check of the submit was synthetically triggered or not.
[09:19:34] <NoiseEee> basiclaser: if you're talking a typical browser prompt like in alerts/confirms, you can't style them
[09:19:35] <zim> basiclaser, I rule is if you send it to the user they own it
[09:19:56] <NoiseEee> basiclaser: but you can certainly 'recreate' them  / simulate them with markup/js/css etc
[09:20:18] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/1fz50z1y/32/ I have this adding removing and updating a single item perfect.. Could someone please advise me on how I could ADD an additional item?
[09:20:18] <robertmaxrees> zim the other way to do this is to use .trigger() and .on() and toss around extra data in the event object to do basically the same thing,
[09:21:34] <zim> robertmaxrees, OK TY looks like I will just have to have a button with a .on
[09:21:46] <robertmaxrees> zim huh?
[09:22:08] <RobertZ23> hi all, do you know some place where I can contribute as a full stack dev, basically using html5, javascript/jquery, css, python/django?  Thanks.
[09:22:10] <robertmaxrees> zim one sec let me show you.
[09:22:35] <zim> robertmaxrees, Many thanks.
[09:28:31] <robertmaxrees> zim it'll looks something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/sq5hdtxj/2/
[09:28:49] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for .trigger() and on() - i forget the exact syntax but you get the idea.
[09:29:36] <zim> robertmaxrees, Will us a .on on the submit button (I know how to do that)
[09:29:47] <robertmaxrees> zim don't bind to the submit button.
[09:29:55] <robertmaxrees> bind to the submit event on the form instead.
[09:30:07] <zim> ok will try that
[09:30:35] <dcope> is there a way to force a div to *always* be the same height as nother?
[09:30:47] <dcope> i've tried using attrchange.js but the callbacks never get fired
[09:31:54] <Jagst3r21> im trying to toggle the submenu items
[09:32:16] <Jagst3r21> im not sure why its not working...http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oGbvC
[09:32:58] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/9489337 -> is there a reason why my variable offsetNav(); is throwing an syntax error?
[09:33:36] <decx> it's a string not a function
[09:34:36] <Racquetball> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85bqT904VWA
[09:34:42] <Racquetball> a man
[09:34:50] <Racquetball> That stands with only 11 other individuals
[09:35:00] <Jagst3r21> anyone? :(
[09:35:01] <Racquetball> as a master penman
[09:35:02] <dmsuperman> Jagst3r21: .menu > .menu doesn't select any elements on that page
[09:35:09] <robertmaxrees> Racquetball off topic broseph
[09:35:15] <Racquetball> LOL
[09:35:16] <dmsuperman> Jagst3r21: there are no items where a .menu is an immediate child of .menu
[09:35:19] <Racquetball> wrong room!
[09:35:20] <Racquetball> sorry
[09:35:32] <Racquetball> apologies
[09:35:36] <dmsuperman> Jagst3r21: try .menu .menu
[09:35:47] <dmsuperman> Jagst3r21: same with the selector above it, remove the >
[09:35:53] <robertmaxrees> zim a simplified example of what you want to do: http://jsfiddle.net/21wt71s6/
[09:36:30] <Jagst3r21> like this? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oGbvC
[09:36:59] <b-lew> fiddle would probably be better. http://jsfiddle.net/4ct0epfs/
[09:37:03] <dmsuperman> Jagst3r21: that will select your uls now yes, but you're then adding a click event to a ul, not the anchor tag
[09:37:30] <dmsuperman> also your codepen doesn't include jquery so obviously the code won't run there
[09:37:57] <dmsuperman> You might want to use jsfiddle so you can include jquery
[09:38:35] <Jagst3r21> woops
[09:38:38] <Jagst3r21> lolol
[09:39:45] <dcope> is there really no simple way to bind a height of a div to anothers so thye weill always be the same height?
[09:40:11] <robertmaxrees> dcope depends on why and what.
[09:40:24] <robertmaxrees> dcope otherwise, you'll need to hook into events/proxy through functions to do that.
[09:40:54] <zim> robertmaxrees, ty will battle on.
[09:41:04] <dmsuperman> easiest way would be to use CSS with a common parent and have them both derive their height from the parent
[09:41:14] <dmsuperman> but two totally disparate divs will be harder
[09:41:40] <gumble> I have a form stored in $(this), how can I access the children of this? e.g. I know inside the form there is a div class="notficiation". Can I somehow access it? $(this + " .notfication") doesn't work
[09:42:01] <Jagst3r21> this is as far as i got http://jsfiddle.net/871x28hx/
[09:42:10] <dmsuperman> gumble: Many ways
[09:42:16] <dmsuperman> gumble: $('.some-selector', this)
[09:42:25] <dmsuperman> gumble: $(this).find('.some-selector')
[09:42:33] <dmsuperman> gumble: you can also do $(this).children and sort through like that
[09:42:48] <robertmaxrees> the first two versions are generally faster iirc.
[09:42:56] <dmsuperman> definitely much faster heh
[09:43:17] <gumble> dmsuperman, thanks!
[09:43:55] <Jagst3r21> dmsuperman any ideas?
[09:45:10] <uskerine> I have a list of JSON objectes  myList.toSource() --->  [{id:139, ref:"SRV001"}, {invId:140, ref:"SRV021"}, ...]     How do I iterate through all items (being each item {id:139, ref:"SRV001"}, etc?
[09:45:51] <dmsuperman> Jagst3r21: why did you cahnge it up?
[09:46:00] <dmsuperman> Jagst3r21: what you had before was almost right you just needed to select the right elements
[09:46:15] <dmsuperman> uskerine: jquery.map
[09:46:23] <dmsuperman> or .each
[09:46:33] <dmsuperman> depending what you want to do with it
[09:46:45] <zim> robertmaxrees, Got it. Many thanks. Problem was here $(this).trigger('submit', {event.cleaned: true}); missing event.
[09:46:58] <robertmaxrees> zim that's another way to do it, yeah,.
[09:47:12] <uskerine> dmsuperman I am not sure I did explain it right as I don't see how map fits here
[09:47:31] <Jagst3r21> dmsuperman what is wrong now, this line? $('.menu li span.nolink').click(function() {
[09:47:33] <robertmaxrees> uskerine a for in loop works, too.
[09:47:47] <uskerine> is there anything like                    for (E element : list) { ... } in java?
[09:47:49] <robertmaxrees> zim or you just add an extra param to your handler, like in my second example :)
[09:48:07] <robertmaxrees> uskerine yes - a for in loop --> for (prop in object) {}
[09:48:35] <dmsuperman> uskerine: javascript has for each syntax
[09:48:40] <dmsuperman> uskerine: and "for...in"
[09:48:48] <uskerine> for (item in myList) {  ... } ?
[09:48:52] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[09:49:12] <phelix> There anyone that is able to help me ?
[09:49:37] <robertmaxrees> uskerine http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vo1tgs9p/
[09:49:44] <robertmaxrees> that's the for...in syntax.
[09:51:33] <robertmaxrees> phelix your example seemed pretty big.  can you make it smaller?
[09:51:52] <Jagst3r21> dmsuperman this is all i got but no luck :( http://jsfiddle.net/871x28hx/1/
[09:52:19] <phelix> Well, its working how its supposed to. Not sure I can remove anything from it or it will defeat the purpose.. I just need to see how to add an additional item to it.
[09:52:27] <phelix> I am not sure its possible to shrink it down.
[09:52:36] <robertmaxrees> phelix your "add an additional item" to what?
[09:52:43] <robertmaxrees> your examples tend to be pretty monolithic.
[09:53:13] <phelix> Just look at the link at the bottom. It is changing the href
[09:53:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:53:42] <phelix> i know, figured it would be hard to find someone to help me look at this.
[09:53:48] <uskerine> thanks robertmaxrees, it helped (based on your fiddle -> http://jsfiddle.net/gaczqf7u/2/)
[09:54:36] <phelix> its perfectly updating one item and removing it... Just not sure how or what to add to have this add an additional item. if that makes any sense
[09:55:09] <phelix> one item is shown with p195_q2 etc...  so adding another needs to format like p195_q2-p234_q1 etc..
[09:55:32] <phelix> I thin I can figure out how to do that if I can only figure out what type of login to put in that script so it can see if one item already exists or not
[09:55:50] <wild_oscar> I need to create a file upload element to a page, via ajax. I currently have the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/rps62ogj/
[09:55:50] <wild_oscar> The problem is that I need to fit this html form into an existing page structure...within a form. This means I need to make this work without the form element (because having a form within a form cannot be done). What would the best approach be to achieve this?
[09:55:54] <phelix> I'm sure I just need some type of an if statement that can recognize this
[09:57:06] <wild_oscar> (I am using jasny's fileinput, btw  -http://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/javascript/#fileinput )
[09:58:19] <robertmaxrees> phelix you seem to be in here pretty regularly still with the same kinds of questions.  have you considered taking a basic course on like codeacademy or something?
[09:59:20] <phelix> That would probably be a good idea. Just trying to learn. Not sure if I have every asked any question like this before.
[09:59:38] <robertmaxrees> you ask lots of the same kinds of questions pretty regularly.
[09:59:45] <robertmaxrees> you'd be well served to take a simple course :)
[10:00:02] <phelix> Yes, I will def take a look at that site.
[10:00:46] <phelix> I mean, I am getting quite a bit figured out. I was able to get pretty far with this script.. I just ca't for the life of me figure out what type of an if statement or what I can do to allow me to append an additional piece of info to that url
[10:06:59] <robertmaxrees> phelix that's why you should take a course or tutorial of some kind - this should be pretty simple stuff by now :)
[10:07:39] <phelix> Yea, Some items I have caught on easier than others.. Would you mind giving me a piece of advice on how to go about doing that ? I am in that website right now taking the courses waiting lol
[10:08:24] <robertmaxrees> http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript
[10:08:47] <phelix> yes I am there right nwo
[10:09:07] <phelix> But, could you also enlightenme on what I am missing here.
[10:09:08] <robertmaxrees> also, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript is a fantastic resource for all things JS
[10:09:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't really have time at this point to dump through your code and logic.
[10:09:34] <phelix> I mean if i even just knew what it was called I could look it up and figure it out
[10:10:05] <phelix> well it ads a single item and removes it and updates the quanity jsut fine.
[10:10:22] <phelix> Just not sure how to do the same thing for an addtional item
[10:11:35] <robertmaxrees> check all products and push the selected ones into an array.
[10:11:58] <phelix> ahh using the push.. hmm ok
[10:12:34] <robertmaxrees> you don't have that array yet, so dunno what your plan is there, but make an array and push every string you want into it.
[10:12:56] <phelix> I am on line 20 and 21
[10:13:12] <phelix> or do
[10:13:14] <robertmaxrees> like I said, i don't really have time to walk through it.
[10:13:23] <phelix> k
[10:59:42] <thaifood> Anyone know how to get the value of a custom attribute on a submit button?  http://laravel.io/bin/D3OWq
[11:00:19] <robertmaxrees> just use .data('cursection')
[11:01:07] <thaifood> like this?  console.log( $(this).data("data-cursection") );
[11:01:14] <thaifood> oops
[11:01:36] <thaifood> $(this).data("cursection")  says undefined
[11:01:49] <robertmaxrees> because your $(this) is not the button/.
[11:02:20] <thaifood> hmm
[11:04:23] <thaifood> robertmaxrees: can you tell me how to target the submit that clicked ?  I have multiples with different values for that attr.
[11:05:48] <BillCriswell> thaifood: It feels like a dirty trick but I think $(document.currentElement) will give you the submit button you clicked.
[11:06:00] <thaifood> i can do dirty
[11:06:06] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[11:06:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah otherwise you need a delegated listener for the button clicks, but depending on what you're doing that gets hairy real quick.
[11:06:53] <thaifood> console.log( $(document.currentElement).data("cursection") );
[11:06:57] <thaifood> undefined
[11:07:07] <robertmaxrees> could you share a fiddle with more code?
[11:07:26] <NoiseEee> http://laravel.io/bin/931aD @ thaifood
[11:08:27] <thaifood> hmm
[11:09:38] <thaifood> NoiseEee: that works, thanks
[11:09:53] <BillCriswell> thaifood: http://jsbin.com/zefosiyoyopo/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:10:12] <thaifood> ooh more codes
[11:10:35] <BillCriswell> Do you want the submit event or the click event?
[11:10:54] <thaifood> submit
[11:11:27] <thaifood> it's kind of convoluted what i'm doing. maybe there's a better way, let me explain
[11:11:57] <robertmaxrees> you could share a fiddle or bin with an example of what you've got?
[11:12:10] <thaifood> i have one big form to submit, it's an insurance application.  I divided it up into divs and plan to show and hide sections with next/prev buttons to navigate
[11:12:59] <thaifood> so each next/previous is a submit with a custom attribute to tell me what section they are on and from that I know what to show and hide
[11:13:18] <thaifood> i'm using jquery validator to prevent the form until it's valid
[11:13:47] <thaifood> this way i'll submit it all as one form once it's valid and still allow the user to go forward and back through it
[11:14:59] <robertmaxrees> bind delegated listeners for the prev. and next buttons.
[11:15:16] <thaifood> i probably need to learn what they are :-)
[11:15:17] <robertmaxrees> is the form submitted via ajax?
[11:15:23] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery on
[11:15:25] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .on() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:15:28] <robertmaxrees> ^ this has relevant docs.
[11:15:56] <thaifood> the form is not submitted with ajax but i make ajax calls on different sections to get data for the form
[11:17:02] <robertmaxrees> mmk.  you'll need to prevent default sumbission events and send around some extra data via a trigger when you're good to go.
[11:17:06] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery trigger
[11:17:11] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .trigger() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[11:17:55] <thaifood> i was planning to use this when i'm ready to submit  $(this).unbind('submit').submit();  $("#application").submit();
[11:19:01] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that personally.
[11:19:19] <thaifood> i'm learning so not sure of the best way
[11:19:28] <thaifood> dogmatic69_: STOP
[11:19:30] <thaifood> oops
[11:19:44] <robertmaxrees> no need to add/remove bindings like that.
[11:20:10] <thaifood> what would you do please ?
[11:20:45] <robertmaxrees> i just told you.
[11:21:00] <robertmaxrees> trigger the submit event with a flag that i check in my on.
[11:25:20] <thaifood> flag here ?  http://laravel.io/bin/4mnD9
[11:27:28] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:27:53] <phelix> k sorry.
[11:27:59] <thaifood> here?  http://laravel.io/bin/w2qrx
[11:28:12] <dmsuperman> read up on the .trigger docs thaifood
[11:28:15] <thaifood> ok
[11:28:19] <dmsuperman> it shows you how to pass extra data to event handlers
[11:28:21] <robertmaxrees> thaifood seriously read the docs I pointed you to.
[11:28:33] <thaifood> will do, thanks
[11:30:32] <robertmaxrees> thaifood this is a simplified example of the concept - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r4w51mjk/
[11:30:46] <robertmaxrees> you can also attach that data as a property to the event object instead if you wanted.
[11:32:48] <thaifood> but if i have 20 buttons i'd have a lot of listeners, I was thinking to have the one listener and do my logic based on which button was clicked
[11:33:09] <thaifood> that's why i have data-cursection attr on each submit with a different value
[11:33:14] <robertmaxrees> i though there were three buttons?
[11:33:18] <robertmaxrees> prev, next, and submit?
[11:33:34] <thaifood> there is one long insurance application form with about 10 sections
[11:33:47] <thaifood> prev/next take you to each section
[11:34:00] <thaifood> and i show/hide sections
[11:34:18] <robertmaxrees> you only need one delegated listener for each button type.
[11:34:37] <thaifood> currently they are all submit buttons
[11:34:47] <robertmaxrees> or do a single delegated listener that routes logic based on the clicked button.
[11:35:03] <thaifood> i think that's where i'm currently going
[11:35:16] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that personally.
[11:35:41] <thaifood> but for 20 buttons what would you do?
[11:35:51] <robertmaxrees> where are the other 17 buttons coming from,?
[11:35:59] <robertmaxrees> and why are they all submit buttons?
[11:36:05] <thaifood> 10 sections with next/prev on each page with submit on last page
[11:36:20] <robertmaxrees> that's 3 delegated listeners.
[11:36:29] <robertmaxrees> not 20.  go read the docs for .on()
[11:36:49] <thaifood> ok i'll go read up on delegated listeners because i'm needing to know more obviously, thx !
[11:36:58] <basiclaser> hey guys, if i have an array of array pairs, how can i switch the positions of each of the pairs? please see the last function.. http://jsbin.com/yuzadu/6/edit
[11:37:02] <thaifood> you'll help me not to design crap
[11:37:26] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser do what now?
[11:37:48] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: :P
[11:38:01] <basiclaser> i have an array of arrays. each subarray contains two elements
[11:38:12] <basiclaser> i would like to switch the elements
[11:39:22] <robertmaxrees> so you want to swap two elements in an array?
[11:40:06] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/872317/923919
[11:43:37] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: the tricky bit is iterating over them, i want to iterate over 500 subarrays but im not sure i can access the elements like that, it didnt seem to work
[11:44:26] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser you can - they're objects.
[11:44:42] <robertmaxrees> you're just doing array1[i][j] at that point.
[11:45:02] <basiclaser> ooh ill try it thanks
[11:45:12] <robertmaxrees> since you're in an array in an array.
[11:45:20] <robertmaxrees> so you need to access the index of an index.
[11:46:45] <basiclaser> robertmaxrees: thanks, for some reason i instinctively wrapped the array[i] in parentheses and it didnt work, it works as you described. thanks
[12:10:49] <TimRiker> in the old datatables there was a .live that I think got called when the table was drawn. I have some nested tables and I want the search on the parent table to effect the displayed rows in the children. I think I see how to call .search() on each of the children, how do I register a callback for when the search input box is edited? it used to be: $(".dataTables_filter input").live()
[12:11:27] <thaifood> As of jQuery version 1.7, the on() method is the new replacement for the bind(), live() and delegate() methods
[12:30:20] <jumanji> how can I get a reference to the iframe element from inside the #document, when the domain differs?
[12:41:01] <Akuw> i have doubt, is better to use jquery in my own server or retrieve from google server?
[12:41:21] <Akuw> i mean for better speed
[12:41:23] <robertmaxrees> depends
[12:41:36] <Akuw> depends ?
[12:41:42] <robertmaxrees> if you do it from, say, google's CDN, the user will likely have the file downloaded and they'll use their cached version
[12:43:44] <Akuw> but i see there is a comunication between server that have my web page and google server
[12:43:58] <Akuw> so, i think, if js is in my server will be faster
[12:44:11] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[12:44:17] <robertmaxrees> you're worried about the DNS lookup.
[12:44:23] <robertmaxrees> and the headers coming back.
[12:44:42] <Akuw> humm
[12:44:47] <robertmaxrees> but some of that is unavoidable.
[12:45:00] <robertmaxrees> are you having performance issues right now?
[12:45:54] <Akuw> yes
[12:46:12] <robertmaxrees> what specifically are you having issues with?
[12:46:27] <Akuw> one was the developers was calling <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.js"></script>   2 times
[12:46:41] <Akuw> one local and one in google
[12:47:39] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[12:47:50] <robertmaxrees> one local, one in google, and then one from code.jquery.com?
[12:49:32] <Akuw> one local and one in code.jquery.com
[12:49:42] <Akuw> i change and now is faster of course
[12:49:58] <robertmaxrees> that's because code.jquery.com is not meant for linking.
[12:50:19] <robertmaxrees> use google's CDN and your own hosting and of course it'll be faster.
[13:00:40] <DelphiWorld> hi jQueryers

[13:03:56] <NoiseEee> if you're just loading a static/dumb page, why not do that server side before its presented to the client?
[13:04:24] <DelphiWorld> NoiseEee: yes it's js based html5 player i'm not so advenced
[13:04:25] <NoiseEee> but anyways good luck

[13:09:07] <RhinoBoss> Is this a proper way of setting sortable items?   $("#sortableID").sortable( "option", "items", "div:not(ui-state-disabled)");
[13:09:45] <RhinoBoss> assumming I have divs as the sortable items, and I want the ones with the ui-state-disabled class to not be sortable
[13:10:37] <RhinoBoss> off im missing a period
[13:10:40] <RhinoBoss> ohh*
[13:12:10] <jonez> greetings.
[13:12:58] <Jovlang> hi
[13:13:33] <Jovlang> Why is this: http://0bin.net/paste/dV20+xNxFXt+GXkj#a610iPrQ6c9s3IP6iTr1Mb+GdOt85h-f3yXDuVwx9HI
[13:13:37] <jonez> I wrote a jquery-based form submission demo. it works fine (submit form -> fade down -> document.write() -> fade up) in chrome but is not perfect in ff.
[13:14:04] <jonez> I need some help figuring out if I can make the all-white blank page go away.
[13:15:00] <Jovlang> Do I really have to write this: pieces = $(".piece"); pieces.map(function(x){return pieces[x]};
[13:18:04] <dmsuperman> jonez: the problem is using document.write
[13:18:09] <basiclaser> hey guys, how could i put an svg image inline in an img tag? :)
[13:18:10] <dmsuperman> jonez: why are you doing document.write
[13:18:52] <dmsuperman> Jovlang: what are you trying to do?
[13:20:28] <Jovlang> dmsuperman: to use .map(). the behavior is quite funky: using a selector, the first argument to the callback is the array index, and using an array, the first argument is the value
[13:22:25] <Jovlang> this is in jquery-1.11.1 using chrome; I doubt it's the intended behavior
[13:23:47] <robertmaxrees> Jovlang per the docs: http://api.jquery.com/map/
[13:23:56] <DelphiWorld> NoiseEee: see if is correct?
[13:23:59] <DelphiWorld> <div class="player"/>
[13:24:00] <DelphiWorld> $( "#player" ).load( "player/index.html" );
[13:25:08] <Jovlang> robertmaxrees: so the jquery devs decided to give their .map() a different callback argument order from the standard .map()?
[13:25:31] <robertmaxrees> Jovlang which version of map?  there are two in jquery.
[13:25:51] <feyd> is there a way to have the .clone() method when called successively not gather all subsequently cloned elements? like only clone 1 each time?
[13:25:52] <NoiseEee> DelphiWorld: as long as index.html isn't a full html document, sure
[13:25:53] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: may you check please?
[13:26:14] <robertmaxrees> $('element').map(callback);, and $.map(object, callback)
[13:26:18] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld sorry, can't atm/
[13:26:20] <Jovlang> robertmaxrees: $(selector).map
[13:26:36] <robertmaxrees> Jovlang sure - that takes one argument - the callback
[13:26:40] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: ok so can ethernet :P
[13:26:47] <dmsuperman> feyd: what do you mean?
[13:26:48] <Jovlang> robertmaxrees: it's the callback that takes two arguments
[13:26:51] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld huh?
[13:26:52] <dmsuperman> feyd: you want access to the clones?
[13:27:01] <Jovlang> and they are passed in the opposite order of [].map
[13:27:08] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: ATM... ethernet, (JOKE) lol
[13:27:23] <feyd> dmsuperman: actually I think i got it, I need to make my selector more specific, i have it cloning a class, when it clones once and I clone again, it clones 2 instead of 1, then 4 instead of two, etc.
[13:27:28] <feyd> dmsuperman: if i set it to :first it should just do once
[13:27:39] <dmsuperman> feyd: you should use a more specific selector if you want only one item
[13:27:45] <feyd> yep, got it
[13:27:45] <robertmaxrees> Jovlang ah that's what you're asking about.  interesting.
[13:27:46] <dmsuperman> like use another attribute
[13:27:48] <dmsuperman> cool
[13:27:53] <robertmaxrees> Jovlang wonder why they did that.
[13:28:07] <dmsuperman> jquery.map is older than [].map isn't it?
[13:28:50] <robertmaxrees> still inconsistent.
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> .each() is thisObj and index.
[13:29:10] <robertmaxrees> iirc every enumerator in jquery is that way, except for .map
[13:29:27] <dmsuperman> Are you sure? I thought .each was i, v
[13:29:30] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's a historical thing.  hasn't been changed since it was written :)
[13:29:44] <dmsuperman> yeah that's what I mean, inconsistent due to backward compatibility
[13:29:59] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're right - .each() IS index, object.
[13:30:04] <Jovlang> it's a bit bizarre having to do $(sel).filter(i,v).map(v,i)
[13:30:44] <robertmaxrees> filter and map are the same order aren't they?
[13:31:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, they are - http://api.jquery.com/map/#map-callback vs http://api.jquery.com/filter/#filter-function
[13:31:59] <dmsuperman> so they're all i, v
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, looks like it.
[13:32:17] <robertmaxrees> or should be, at least.
[13:32:32] <robertmaxrees> i so rarely use those arguments at this point.
[13:32:46] <dmsuperman> yeah
[13:32:51] <Jovlang> robertmaxrees: my bad, i meant $(sel).map(i,v).filter(v,i)
[13:33:05] <ZogDog> With regards to select2 (http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#placeholders), how would I acquire the selected items in the list?
[13:33:16] <robertmaxrees> Jovlang reread the docs - they're both index, thisObj
[13:33:24] <Jovlang> in that case you use jquery's map and the standard filter
[13:33:32] <robertmaxrees> Jovlang huh?
[13:33:38] <dmsuperman> .map returns a jquery collection
[13:33:41] <dmsuperman> I think even with arrays
[13:33:48] <dmsuperman> it just happens to act like an array
[13:33:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah they both return jquery objects.
[13:34:03] <Jovlang> aha
[13:34:25] <dmsuperman> >> [1,2].map(function() { return this; });
[13:34:36] <dmsuperman> >> [1,2].map(function(v) { return v; });
[13:34:40] <Jovlang> my bad
[13:34:54] <dmsuperman> oh wrong chan for ecmabot
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> !g select2 get value
[13:35:13] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Select2 3.5.1 - GitHub Pages â†’ http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/
[13:35:19] <robertmaxrees> ZogDog the docs should have it.
[13:36:21] <ZogDog> robertmaxrees: I'll recheck and see if I can't understand, or give you a better specific question.  Thank you.
[13:36:41] <robertmaxrees> .val() or .select2('val'), depending on how you initialized.
[13:37:42] <ZogDog> okay
[13:38:32] <Jovlang> you can't map something like function double(x){return x*2} across a jquery collection; it has to be aware of jquery's convention and operate on the second arg instead of the first
[13:38:48] <Jovlang> so you need one version for $(sel).map and one for [].map
[13:39:13] <robertmaxrees> Jovlang right. because they're two separate objects.
[13:39:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:39:51] <Jovlang> because jquery wasn't developed by lisp hackers ;o
[13:40:12] <robertmaxrees> nope, javascript was :)
[13:40:28] <dmsuperman> If it got to the point that you wanted to plug and play map methods like that I would make a wrapper that calls the relevant method with your alternate callback order
[13:40:38] <systemfault> Jovlang: It's even worse than that,  jQuery's convention is to use the "this" which is why the first arg is the index.
[13:40:39] <dmsuperman> easy peasy
[13:42:00] <robertmaxrees> aaaand from, the devs: The real reason is because jQuery methods are element-based, so you already have access to the element as `this`.  That makes the index more useful as the first parameter.  That was the logic back then, when there was no native .map().
[13:42:12] <ZogDog> robertmaxrees: I unfortunately don't understand how I'm supposed to capture the values of the options once you click an item selected.  The problem is it overrides the entire <select> and <option> elements and replaces it with a <ul> and <li>, which is fine.  I assign value to <option> to be the ID, but it gets erased
[13:43:00] <robertmaxrees> ZogDog can you share some code?
[13:43:04] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle?
[13:43:10] <ZogDog> sure one sec
[13:44:51] <Jovlang> [3,7,9].map(function(){return this});[ Window ,  Window ,  Window ]
[13:45:04] <Jovlang> ^^
[13:45:41] <ZogDog> robertmaxrees: Well, not sure how it would work exactly, but here's the basic, but I'm not sure how to link to select2 css and js http://jsfiddle.net/m8k56ftL/
[13:46:28] <robertmaxrees> ZogDog check out the "external resources" on the left, but $("#e2_2") should still exist afterwards.
[13:46:58] <ZogDog> robertmaxrees: Oh cool, let me link up to it real quick!
[13:47:27] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, $('#e2_2').val() should work just fine.
[13:50:33] <ZogDog> robertmaxrees: I think that's what I needed
[13:51:15] <ZogDog> robertmaxrees: thank you!
[13:58:19] <RhinoBoss> How can I select a parent dive element by its child's span text? For example, <div id='test'><span id='stuff'>SOME TEXT</span></div>
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> why are you selecting by text?
[13:59:05] <RhinoBoss> Could I do $('#test span:contains('SOME')')
[13:59:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:59:22] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify your question?
[13:59:30] <RhinoBoss> i need to trigger some related things, and will only have text that is similar in both items
[13:59:44] <robertmaxrees> not following.
[14:00:01] <RhinoBoss> I need to select the "test" div (the parent), but all I will have to go on is the test of the span
[14:00:14] <robertmaxrees> check out .closest()
[14:00:18] <RhinoBoss> I wont have the id "test"
[14:00:55] <RhinoBoss> Let me explain it better
[14:01:01] <RhinoBoss> or better yet, make a fiddle
[14:01:04] <RhinoBoss> ill be back
[14:01:14] <robertmaxrees> you want $('span:contains('some')).closest('div')
[14:02:16] <Jovlang> lol: piecesOwnedBy("W").map(function(i,v){return validMoves(v)}).map(function(i,v){highlight(v)})
[14:02:20] <Jovlang> time to make that wrapper
[14:03:50] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: thanks, Ill try that
[14:06:49] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: that works, but there are dusplicate items like this in 2 different sortables. I need to narrow it down by the ID of the one sortable, but it isnt working if I add the ID selector in front of then span:contains....
[14:07:13] <robertmaxrees> rhizome do what now?
[14:07:16] <robertmaxrees> err, RhinoBoss
[14:07:30] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: So I need something like $('#grayList span:contains('some')).closest('div')
[14:07:45] <RhinoBoss> but this doesnt seem to work
[14:08:05] <robertmaxrees> $('#grayList span:contains('some')) is looking for the span with the text of "some" under #grayList
[14:08:22] <disf> hi
[14:09:01] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: hmm, well grayList is the outer div, then there are multiple divs inside of it which contain spans
[14:09:02] <disf> someone can help me?
[14:09:17] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ disf
[14:09:17] <b-ot> disf: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:09:19] <RhinoBoss> disf: just ask the question straight away
[14:09:21] <drej> disf not until you ask a question :)
[14:09:31] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss i need a fiddle then.
[14:09:32] <drej> who in here considers themselves a frontend ninja?
[14:09:39] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: coming
[14:09:46] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> (jokes)
[14:10:03] <drej> gross
[14:10:05] <Jovlang> i'm a frontend ninja!
[14:10:11] <disf> i dowonload this rss viewer http://www.jquery4u.com/demos/jquery-rss-feed/
[14:10:17] <drej> Jovlang folio url?
[14:10:33] <Jovlang> drej: we ninjas work stealthily
[14:10:42] <drej> i understand
[14:10:45] <disf> and it is work nice - but i want to get more lines in the post.
[14:10:58] <disf> someone can help me with that?
[14:11:38] <disf> someone?
[14:11:46] <robertmaxrees> disf give us some time yo.
[14:11:52] <robertmaxrees> we have to read the docs, just like you should.
[14:11:57] <drej> robertmaxrees what you didnt read the entire plugin in the 11 seconds between messages?
[14:12:00] <drej> you should be ashamed of yourself.
[14:12:03] <robertmaxrees> lol seriously.
[14:12:04] <Jovlang> well here's the wrapper: function tw(func) { return function(i, v) { return func(v, i); }}
[14:12:22] <disf> robertmaxrees: ok :)
[14:12:35] <robertmaxrees> disf the docs tell you how to do that.
[14:12:51] <disf> what is docs?
[14:12:55] <drej> documents
[14:12:56] <robertmaxrees> http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-rss-feed-display-live/
[14:13:00] <robertmaxrees> documentation.
[14:13:12] <robertmaxrees> check out "HTML Code"
[14:13:19] <dmsuperman> Jovlang: I was thinking of a wrapper to wrap the methods themselves
[14:13:41] <Jovlang> ah
[14:13:44] <dmsuperman> Jovlang: $.reverseCall('map', [1, 2, 3], function(v, i))
[14:13:55] <disf> robertmaxrees: the line newsfeed.filterfeed(10, "date");
[14:13:55] <dmsuperman> or even one just for map to save an arg
[14:14:24] <disf> only control the number of post - not how much text it will show.
[14:15:01] <robertmaxrees> disf then modify the code?
[14:15:06] <Jovlang> can I do this: $(sel).myMap(function(v, i))
[14:15:07] <disf> how?
[14:15:16] <dmsuperman> Jovlang: yeah with jquery.fn.extend
[14:15:19] <robertmaxrees> disf by reading the code?
[14:15:21] <Jovlang> cool
[14:15:23] <robertmaxrees> and figuring it out?
[14:15:32] <disf> robertmaxrees: i'm  not a programer.
[14:15:40] <dmsuperman> lol
[14:15:51] <Jovlang> xah lee is here?
[14:15:53] <disf> robertmaxrees: this is way i'm here.
[14:16:28] <robertmaxrees> disf are you looking for somebody to do this for you?
[14:16:50] <Jovlang> i can do whatever it is for $1500000
[14:16:54] <dmsuperman> disf: my hourly rate is only $30/hr
[14:17:12] <disf> yes, i know it is simple, i think it's something in line 113 in the js code.
[14:17:23] <robertmaxrees> disf then try to change it :)
[14:17:53] <disf> i dont know how - i'm not a programer
[14:18:11] <dmsuperman> I'm a programmer!
[14:18:36] <robertmaxrees> disf this is a support channel for jquery - not a place that does stuff for free :) somebody might throw you a bone, but don't hold your breath.
[14:18:56] <Jovlang> i'm a programer, that's even better
[14:20:00] <disf> i see some comment of "@Peter" here http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-rss-feed-display-live/
[14:20:29] <disf> someone can help me to understand if this is the solution?
[14:21:09] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: I need this to only add the class to the bottom group http://jsfiddle.net/hzwcrwbp/
[14:21:32] <disf> ?
[14:22:40] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hzwcrwbp/1/
[14:22:41] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:23:18] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: LoL.... I didnt try that because it wasnt workign in my actual application
[14:23:19] <RhinoBoss> thanks...
[14:24:06] <disf> some good soul?
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> disf not sure how to rephrase it buddy :)
[14:24:34] <jonez> does anyone know of a way to build a document ala document.write() but store it in a var to be faded up once it's done building?
[14:25:01] <robertmaxrees> jonez you can (and should) do that in a fragment or with jquery object.
[14:25:16] <SwasChanC> Could anyone have a look at this and figure out why it's breaking?
[14:25:16] <SwasChanC> http://pastebin.com/fEpGFCQ2
[14:25:20] <robertmaxrees> $('<div>').append('<span>some text</span>')
[14:25:34] <SwasChanC> Appreciated, thanks
[14:26:08] <jonez> I tried animating just the body, but there are some cases where the <script> tags or the css will change for the new page
[14:26:39] <robertmaxrees> SwasChanC try changing line 4 to ld) do that in a fragment or with jquery object.

[14:26:40] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[14:26:43] <jonez> so my only choice (at least so far) is to use document.write()
[14:26:46] <robertmaxrees> to this: var $targetInput = $("input[name=" + inputContainer + "]");
[14:26:53] <robertmaxrees> jonez huh?  don't use document.write() ever
[14:26:57] <robertmaxrees> it's a terrible idea.
[14:27:24] <jonez> it works fine in chrome and a little glitchy in ff
[14:27:41] <robertmaxrees> jonez great example of why you shouldn't use it ;)
[14:27:43] <jonez> I am open to other ideas that will get the same effect :)
[14:27:48] <robertmaxrees> i told you one.
[14:28:16] <robertmaxrees> build up the fragment, append it to a hidden container, fade the container in,.
[14:28:28] <disf> someone can help me modify the code?
[14:32:01] <SwasChanC> @robertmaxrees, thanks
[14:32:11] <SwasChanC> works, but desired effect still not there, darn
[14:32:50] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: this is what that selector is giving me... http://imgur.com/gallery/1QU9pB8/new
[14:33:30] <robertmaxrees> i hate screenshots of stuff.  fiddle please?
[14:34:02] <RhinoBoss> ? Its the same fiddle as what I had earlier, except its in my application now
[14:34:08] <RhinoBoss> and Im doing the same thing
[14:34:25] <RhinoBoss> that screenshot was the colsole.log of the jquery selector which you fixed in my fiddle
[14:34:27] <robertmaxrees> then your selector is bad.
[14:34:30] <robertmaxrees> dunno what yo tell you.
[14:34:32] <robertmaxrees> *to
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> is your markup valid?
[14:34:48] <RhinoBoss> From looking at the screenshot, does anything incorrect pop out at you?
[14:35:25] <RhinoBoss> yes
[14:35:50] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss try using that selector in the console.
[14:36:04] <robertmaxrees> really hard to tell you what's up when i don't have your site in front of me.
[14:36:05] <robertmaxrees> sooo
[14:36:08] <SwasChanC> Ow, I see the error
[14:36:13] <SwasChanC> Oh, in my script
[14:36:22] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[14:36:29] <ThoMe> hiho
[14:36:36] <SwasChanC> Not RhinoBoss's script
[14:36:42] <robertmaxrees> oh hahaha
[14:37:05] <SwasChanC> i tried to create a child node and a child node of the child node using append
[14:37:09] <SwasChanC> I dont think thats possible.
[14:37:31] <ThoMe> how i can create this optionsAutoSave = [ { label: "1", value: "1"}, label: "2", value: "2"}]; dynamic?
[14:37:35] <ThoMe> from 1 - 20 example
[14:37:39] <ThoMe> is this probiel?
[14:37:42] <ThoMe> posible  :-)
[14:37:47] <robertmaxrees> ThoMe do waht now?
[14:37:58] <ThoMe> robertmaxrees: hm?
[14:38:18] <ThoMe> create a object with two keys, label and value and this 20 times
[14:38:25] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: doing it in the console works, oddly
[14:38:30] <ThoMe> or array? i dont know what is the exact name.
[14:38:33] <robertmaxrees> ThoMe that's an array.
[14:38:35] <robertmaxrees> [] is array
[14:38:37] <robertmaxrees> {} is objectg.
[14:38:50] <ThoMe> ok. then a object in a array.
[14:39:08] <robertmaxrees> why not just use an object?
[14:39:13] <robertmaxrees> or a plain array?
[14:39:26] <ThoMe> robertmaxrees: is a script what i give datas.
[14:39:32] <robertmaxrees> okay
[14:39:39] <ThoMe> but i would like create dynamic.
[14:39:55] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: this is the code that wont return the element: console.log($("#grayList span:contains('"+e.currentTarget.firstChild.textContent+"')"));
[14:40:01] <ThoMe> robertmaxrees: can you help me?
[14:40:10] <SwasChanC> Wow, I feel sorry for robert
[14:40:16] <robertmaxrees> ThoMe sure - what have you tried?
[14:40:17] <RhinoBoss> lol
[14:40:18] <SwasChanC> Sort these two out first, I'll try fixing mah own problem
[14:40:24] <robertmaxrees> SwasChanC :) it's all good.
[14:40:25] <ThoMe> makeArray
[14:40:44] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss e.currentTarget.firstChild.textContent looks suspect to me.
[14:40:48] <robertmaxrees> console.log() that out.
[14:40:56] <robertmaxrees> ThoMe do you have a fiddle or anything?
[14:40:57] <RhinoBoss> i did, it is valid
[14:41:02] <ThoMe> robertmaxrees: yes. mom
[14:41:36] <SwasChanC> mom?
[14:41:50] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: remember that imgur link I sent? It subsitituted the correct text in for that
[14:42:30] <robertmaxrees> "moment", SwasChanC
[14:42:41] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss that's... not what I asked, but OK.
[14:42:54] <RhinoBoss> When I manually typed in the jquery selector into the console, it only worked when I had double quotes on the outside, and single quotes around the e.currentTarget...
[14:42:56] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss unless I have your page in front of me, I can't realy be of much help at this point.
[14:43:26] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: well you said it looks suspect, but it is valid and returns the proper text. I was just letting you know
[14:43:46] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: ok, i appreciate your help so far, thanks
[14:44:35] <ThoMe> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/u828xgyy/ correct or?
[14:45:03] <robertmaxrees> don't use alert :(
[14:45:06] <robertmaxrees> use console.log()
[14:45:28] <ThoMe> robertmaxrees: sorry.
[14:45:39] <robertmaxrees> ThoMe http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/120bfusd/1/
[14:45:42] <robertmaxrees> you were close.
[14:45:57] <SwasChanC> Alright, my question
[14:46:15] <SwasChanC> Is it possible to append a child and a child of that child?
[14:46:30] <robertmaxrees> SwasChanC depends on how you're building stuff.
[14:47:03] <SwasChanC> im building a script for form validation [trying one myself]
[14:47:22] <SwasChanC> and the error message is a <p> within a <div>
[14:47:29] <SwasChanC> so in order to dynamically generate that..
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> SwasChanC easy - don't do the appends like that.
[14:47:52] <SwasChanC> eh?
[14:47:57] <robertmaxrees> let  me show you.
[14:48:40] <robertmaxrees> instead, do something like var $parentDiv = $('<div/>'), $childP = $('<p>some text</p>'); $parentDiv.append($childp);  $('#someTarget').append($someDiv);
[14:49:37] <SwasChanC> got a fiddle?
[14:49:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:50:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vd2u5Lp4/
[14:51:14] <robertmaxrees> the nice thing about this approach is it'll also perform a helluva lot better.
[14:51:15] <SwasChanC> Who is dedondee and why is he spamming me?
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> it's a bot.
[14:52:01] <SwasChanC> Yeah, had that figured
[14:52:05] <SwasChanC> Kill it with fire
[14:52:07] <robertmaxrees> i can take care of that.  one sec.
[14:52:42] <robertmaxrees> they're not in here it looks like.
[14:52:49] <SwasChanC> * dedondee has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[14:53:02] <robertmaxrees> hah - that answers that question! totally missed that.
[14:53:50] <SwasChanC> That feeling when you're writing js and a mosquito's flying arodun and instead of hitting the mosquite you hit your glasses and drive them deep into the bridge of your nose
[14:53:56] <SwasChanC> around*
[15:04:38] <jonez> what happens when I need to change some items in the <head> section? for example the new page might not need certain css files, or I might want to not run my js snippets.
[15:04:56] <jonez> if I do this pagecontent div, it can work, but limits the types of changes I can make.
[15:07:45] <dmsuperman> jonez: you shouldn't be removing css with javascript
[15:08:06] <robertbusy> word
[15:08:14] <jonez> I'm not.
[15:08:34] <jonez> I was using document.write() .. I had the entire page (prolog and all) built up.
[15:08:39] <motaka2> hello , in this page when I move my mouse on Target the opening menu goes under the javascript. what should I do? http://jsfiddle.net/54xb891r/3/
[15:08:56] <dmsuperman> stop using document.write jonez
[15:09:08] <jonez> I'm trying that, but it has limitations
[15:09:24] <dmsuperman> if you don't want to include CSS, just don't include that CSS
[15:09:30] <dmsuperman> modify the HTML file and do so
[15:09:36] <dmsuperman> or modify your backend code to conditionally include it
[15:09:46] <dmsuperman> or you could even dynamically load your CSS via JS if you really wanted
[15:09:47] <jonez> if I make a #pagecontent, and fade that down and then up, don't I keep all the js and css already in the document?
[15:10:04] <dmsuperman> yeah
[15:10:38] <jonez> ok. I can think of one case where I might not want to have certain js snippets running. I can't change that if all I am manipulating is a div
[15:10:48] <jonez> s/might/do/
[15:10:52] <dmsuperman> why would a div be the only thing you can manipulate?
[15:11:00] <SwasChanC> Why is my function looping 2 times?
[15:11:13] <dmsuperman> because you touch yourself at night SwasChanC
[15:11:24] <SwasChanC> It'd loop 69 times then.
[15:11:29] <dmsuperman> heyooo
[15:11:37] <SwasChanC> heyoooooo
[15:14:59] <jonez> dmsuperman, would fading <body> work fairly consistently?
[15:15:26] <dmsuperman> you still haven't really provided details aboutw hat you're doing
[15:15:41] <jonez> ok. I have a live demo, I'll pm you the url if that's ok
[15:16:22] <jonez> it comes down to catching the submit event on a form, fading down the page, using the response from $.post to build up a new page, and then fading it up
[15:17:11] <dmsuperman> just make one div wrap around your whole "page" and make it the full width and height of the body
[15:17:13] <jonez> one twist is that I am using a package (html_page2) that doesn't let me display just the <body>.. it's the whole document
[15:17:25] <jonez> oh wrap *everything* in that one big dig?
[15:17:42] <dmsuperman> wrap the _body_ in one big div yeah
[15:17:50] <dmsuperman> js and css still should mostly be in the head
[15:17:57] <jonez> so my pageheader, sidebar, pagefooter, etc?
[15:18:05] <dmsuperman> whatever it is that changes from page to page
[15:18:09] <jonez> on my pages they are always in the head.
[15:18:36] <dmsuperman> if it's just the center page content div, then only rebuild that
[15:18:46] <jonez> for form responses, other than wanting to turn off some interval-based snippets, it's prolly safe
[15:18:51] <dmsuperman> if your backend only supports full pages I would swap out the backend for something that doesn't suck ;P
[15:19:16] <dmsuperman> what does html_page2 do for you anyway? Why not just write your own HTML output?
[15:19:36] <jonez> I can programatically build up an html document. it's quite slick.
[15:19:46] <dmsuperman> if you absolutely can't swap the backend, you could use something like mustache to render only the center div
[15:19:58] <dmsuperman> and use a JSON response to populate the new mustache template to show in the page content area
[15:20:23] <dmsuperman> you might also want to check out requirejs for dynamically including javascript onto a page
[15:20:51] <dmsuperman> though I think that fixing this in the backend is the right solution
[15:47:32] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/yc45Lmcq/ -> I'm trying to calculate the height of a div and offser().top that variable. but I'm getting a syntax error. Can I grab some help with this?
[15:52:34] <robertmaxrees> b-lew did you look at your console?
[15:52:56] <b-lew> yea, says it's a syntax error
[15:53:31] <robertmaxrees> scrollTop: targetHashID.offset().top getHeightOfNav ?
[15:53:37] <robertmaxrees> what is this supposed to do?
[15:53:40] <stephen> ro
[15:53:42] <stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/yc45Lmcq/1/
[15:53:43] <stephen> er
[15:53:59] <stephen> b-lew,
[15:54:00] <stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/yc45Lmcq/1/
[15:54:48] <robertmaxrees> stephen partially fixed it - b-lew what was that line I pasted supposed to do?
[15:55:24] <b-lew> the var getHeightOfNav which should be the height of the header div should be offset
[15:55:43] <b-lew> does that make sense?
[15:55:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:55:50] <b-lew> damn.
[15:55:56] <robertmaxrees> scrollTop: targetHashID.offset().top getHeightOfNav
[15:56:02] <b-lew> scrollTop: targetHashID.offset().top getHeightOfNav
[15:56:03] <robertmaxrees> what is this line trying to do?
[15:56:05] <b-lew> you see that line?
[15:56:08] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:56:11] <robertmaxrees> i asked you this already
[15:56:20] <b-lew> getHeightOfNav is causing an error
[15:56:23] <robertmaxrees> right
[15:56:33] <robertmaxrees> because  targetHashID.offset().top getHeightOfNav doesn't make any sense.
[15:56:37] <b-lew> I have the var set. var getHeightOfNav = $( "header" ).height();
[15:56:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:56:50] <robertmaxrees> you're not answering my question.
[15:56:57] <b-lew> so I must be calling that variable wrong.
[15:57:05] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to subtract getHeightOfNav from that offset().top?
[15:57:06] <robertmaxrees> add it?
[15:57:15] <b-lew> subtract
[15:57:20] <robertmaxrees>  targetHashID.offset().top - getHeightOfNav
[15:57:22] <b-lew> so its down further on the page.
[15:57:50] <robertmaxrees> so slap a - between the two...
[15:57:59] <Jayflux> is it possible to get the head, it seems jquery's parse ignores head and body tags
[15:58:01] <b-lew> ahhh thank you!!!
[15:58:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yc45Lmcq/2/
[15:58:11] <b-lew> I didn't know I needed anything in there.
[15:58:13] <robertmaxrees> also fixed a few other minor things for you.
[15:58:17] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[15:58:26] <robertmaxrees> what would that code you had earlier have done?
[15:58:42] <robertmaxrees> the output for that was just a number followed by another number
[15:58:57] <b-lew> it scrolls to an id on the page
[15:59:05] <b-lew> yea it outputs a number
[15:59:22] <robertmaxrees> that specific line though - it's like saying '25 325'
[15:59:30] <robertmaxrees> just outputting two numbers.
[16:00:42] <b-lew> oh I just want to offset it the height of that div... should only be one number
[16:00:55] <robertmaxrees> then remove that variable.
[16:01:06] <robertmaxrees> which means you can get rid of that variable declaration
[16:01:14] <b-lew> remove this? var getHeightOfNav = $( "header" ).height();
[16:01:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.  not being used any more.
[16:01:31] <robertmaxrees> and the variable getHeightOfNav from that line from earlier.
[16:01:46] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yc45Lmcq/2/
[16:01:53] <b-lew> like this link but remove that variable line?
[16:02:18] <robertmaxrees> you just said you don't need getHeightOfNav
[16:02:21] <robertmaxrees> soooo....
[16:02:52] <b-lew> I just want the height of the header div ya.
[16:03:07] <robertmaxrees> then leave that var.
[16:03:36] <b-lew> that var calculates the height
[16:03:45] <b-lew> can I add another div to that calculation?
[16:04:07] <robertmaxrees> store the heights in different vars, then add them together.
[16:04:40] <b-lew> okay great. thanks for the help!
[16:04:52] <robertmaxrees> also, I'd rename that var to something like headerDivHeight.
[16:05:09] <robertmaxrees> the word "get" implies you're calling a function, which could be confusing.
[16:05:38] <b-lew> thanks, I'll change that right now.
[16:08:15] <b-lew> works perfectly! thanks so much robertmaxrees
[16:08:23] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[16:08:58] <jonez> does anyone know of a package which programatically builds up html pages in php, but will let me be selective about displaying <head> vs. <body>?
[16:20:10] <b-lew> is there a way to have the browser run a function when the width of the browser changes?
[16:21:00] <robertmaxrees> bind to the resize event of the window - $(window).on('resize', function() {});
[16:21:31] <tw2113> what robertmaxrees said, i would have been wrong because i was thinking "change" but remembered that's an event for inputs
[16:22:45] <b-lew> thanks again robertmaxrees
[16:22:48] <b-lew> i'll try this.
[16:26:35] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:31:50] <jftf> is it possible to kill a jquery plugin, let's say a slider when there's no explicit option for it?
[16:33:53] <jenia> hello. i want to use a collapsible and up some information in the collapsible's header. Is that possible?
[16:34:19] <jenia> like i want to make the header have a few divs or something... or spans lets say
[17:41:14] <alphis> if i want to serialize a array variable how can i do this
[17:41:27] <robertmaxrees> to a string?
[17:41:32] <alphis> yeah
[17:41:40] <robertmaxrees> array.join(â€˜,â€™);
[17:42:12] <alphis> really? lol
[17:42:24] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:42:26] <alphis> so i have an array with ints and strings and another array with ints and strings
[17:42:29] <tw2113> would the internet lie to you?
[17:42:36] <alphis> i can just myarrayibject.join(",") ?
[17:42:37] <alphis> haha
[17:42:38] <robertmaxrees> â€œints and stringsâ€ - back that up.
[17:42:41] <robertmaxrees> show me an example.
[17:43:15] <alphis> { id: 5, { {5: "hi"},{6: ""} } }
[17:43:31] <robertmaxrees> thatâ€™s not an array.
[17:43:40] <alphis> { id: 5, data: { {5: "hi"},{6: ""} } }
[17:43:42] <alphis> more accurate sorry
[17:43:45] <alphis> so
[17:44:05] <tw2113> still look like objects to me
[17:44:10] <robertmaxrees> thatâ€™s not a valid object, either.
[17:44:12] <alphis> myobj['id'] and myobj['data'][0] myobj['data'][1]
[17:44:25] <robertmaxrees> thatâ€™s...
[17:44:28] <alphis> oh then how to serialize an object
[17:44:33] <alphis> its just two parts
[17:44:35] <alphis> id
[17:44:45] <robertmaxrees> could you share an actual example of your data?
[17:44:45] <alphis> and data with an array of ID -> STR pairs
[17:44:47] <robertmaxrees> on jsfiddle?
[17:45:14] <alphis> to figure out how to serialize?
[17:45:28] <robertmaxrees> i donâ€™t know what your data structure is, so I donâ€™t know what you give you.
[17:47:08] <alphis> its an object of strings and another object
[17:47:59] <alphis> is { id: 5, data: { {5: "hi"},{6: ""} } } not valid? this is what i need to use
[17:48:39] <alphis> id and data are fields of my object
[17:48:44] <alphis> id is an int
[17:48:51] <alphis> data is an array of key/val pairs
[17:50:13] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[17:55:00] <robertmaxrees> that is not a valid object.
[17:56:10] <alphis> robertmaxrees: if you're going to ignore my question because i dont have the proper syntax then your help is very limited
[17:56:38] <robertmaxrees> i canâ€™t help you because your data isnâ€™t valid.
[17:56:41] <alphis> i told u what i want structurally. my example is invalid
[17:56:43] <tw2113> syntax, last it checked, is quite important for valid objects/arrays
[17:56:49] <alphis> but im sure u can imagine in ur lil mind what im asking for
[17:56:54] <robertmaxrees> excuse me?
[17:56:57] <alphis> unless ur a compiler
[17:57:00] <alphis> i dont see how it matters
[17:57:04] <alphis> i say i want an int to be 5
[17:57:09] <alphis> and say int5
[17:57:15] <alphis> u complaining about syntax is a waste of time
[17:57:21] <robertmaxrees> i canâ€™t enumerate over an invalid object.
[17:57:28] <alphis> im sure
[17:57:33] <alphis> but u can read english i think
[17:57:40] <robertmaxrees> mmk.
[17:58:59] <BillCriswell> lol
[17:59:03] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[17:59:16] <BillCriswell> It's about home time for you anyway isn't it?
[17:59:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah in a few.
[17:59:33] <robertmaxrees> wrapping some stuff up atm.
[18:00:10] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[18:00:28] <tw2113> { id: 5, data: { {5: "hi"},{6: ""} } } ?object with a property of id and a value of 5, property of data with an object of objects ?
[18:00:40] <robertmaxrees> lol tw2113
[18:01:13] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I'm learning Vue, seems pretty sweet so far.
[18:01:19] <robertmaxrees> vue?
[18:01:29] <BillCriswell> http://vuejs.org/
[18:01:35] <alphis> tw2113: array of objects
[18:01:40] <alphis> but thanks for pretending to not know what i meant
[18:01:42] <robertmaxrees> alphis thatâ€™s not an array.
[18:01:53] <alphis> yes should use [] and not {}
[18:01:57] <tw2113> so { id: 5, data: [ {5: "hi"},{6: ""} ] }
[18:02:05] <alphis> ..
[18:02:07] <alphis> its like slowmo
[18:02:21] <robertmaxrees> iâ€™d appreciate it if you didnâ€™t insult us, alphis
[18:02:21] <alphis> imagine syntax is perfect for what u know what im trying to represent
[18:02:24] <alphis> thats all
[18:02:50] <alphis> its not that hard to imagine it with proper syntax is it.
[18:03:10] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you intend - thatâ€™s why I was asking for a reason example.  why is that such a big problem?
[18:03:10] <tw2113> it's less difficult to type it right the first time
[18:03:35] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell interesting...
[18:03:49] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: It's making a lot of sense so far, which is nice.
[18:03:57] <robertmaxrees> seems relatively, simple, too.
[18:04:00] <tw2113> so, let's go back to the ORIGINAL problem
[18:04:05] <tw2113> and what you're trying to do
[18:04:07] <alphis> its so simple u knew exactly what i was requesting
[18:04:08] <alphis> so
[18:04:15] <alphis> pretend u have this type of object
[18:04:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:04:19] <alphis> but pretend its syntax is ok
[18:04:21] <alphis> how to serialize
[18:04:22] <BillCriswell> I usually just poke around at the manual but I'm actually reading this all the way through.
[18:04:35] <alphis> u dont NEED to know how it should look if you understand the question
[18:04:38] <tw2113> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[18:04:53] <robertmaxrees> serialize is for forms, not opbjects.
[18:04:58] <alphis> i read that
[18:04:58] <tw2113> oops
[18:05:04] <alphis> i dont want to serialize elements
[18:05:06] <tw2113> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8164802/serialize-javascript-object-into-a-json-string
[18:05:08] <alphis> i want to serialize my own object
[18:05:14] <alphis> i said this like..in first 2 lines
[18:05:19] <BillCriswell> I think you want $.param
[18:05:25] <robertmaxrees> he mistakenly pasted a link.
[18:05:26] <alphis> then got the pleasure of syntax kids...wasting all this time until now lol
[18:05:34] <alphis> yea i am thinking $.param
[18:05:45] <alphis> would force my object into "selection" for jquery serialization
[18:05:51] <BillCriswell> It's not wasting time. Details matter.
[18:05:52] <alphis> but was hoping for a non jquery ish way
[18:06:02] <alphis> details matter when the question is related to details
[18:06:09] <alphis> you just enjoy sounding intelligent
[18:06:15] <tw2113> read the guts of of $.param to see what it does in there for a vanilla js way
[18:06:18] <robertmaxrees> please donâ€™t insult other users, alphis
[18:06:26] <alphis> take ur own advice
[18:06:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:06:43] <tw2113> stop insulting each other, in short
[18:06:54] <BillCriswell> I'm going to stop insulting me.
[18:06:55] <robertmaxrees> not trying to insult anybody.
[18:07:20] <alphis> yeah vanilla js is what im looking for if possible. like i said i want to serialize my own object not some jquery selection
[18:07:29] <tw2113> did you read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8164802/serialize-javascript-object-into-a-json-string
[18:07:54] <robertmaxrees> $.param() will do that.  otherwise youâ€™ll need to use another lib or bake up your own deal that enumerates and iterates where appropriate to build up your string.
[18:08:10] <alphis> i see
[18:08:24] <alphis> i thought json was ubiquitous enough to be part of javascript
[18:08:25] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple recursive function could handle that.
[18:08:27] <alphis> and not specific to jquery
[18:08:34] <tw2113> it is
[18:08:45] <tw2113> it's not specific to jQuery
[18:08:49] <robertmaxrees> JSON is short for â€œjavascript object notationâ€ - itâ€™s based on how you make objects in javascript.
[18:09:08] <alphis> and i would imagine there'd be a simple function to convert arbitrary objects into json
[18:09:15] <alphis> apparently thats an incorrect assumption
[18:09:18] <robertmaxrees> you want to convert it to a string, not JSON
[18:09:41] <alphis> i want a json string
[18:09:54] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript json to string
[18:09:57] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: JSON.stringify() - JavaScript | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify
[18:10:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:11:12] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ralazekavequ/1/edit?html,js,output weee
[18:11:15] <alphis> ..im starting with an object u know that right
[18:11:25] <robertmaxrees> right.  you want to stringify an object.
[18:11:39] <BillCriswell> alphis: That link was for you.
[18:11:43] <robertmaxrees> JSON.stringify({data: [1,2,3]});
[18:12:25] <robertmaxrees> unless you want to go from a string to JSON, in which case you probably want JSON.parse()
[18:13:32] <BillCriswell> I'm glad there was no hair pulling.
[18:13:40] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell is vue really religious about what you do?  like angular?  or does it let you do what you wnat?
[18:13:51] <tw2113> mmmm beer
[18:14:18] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: It seems pretty open so far. I'm not sure I'm smart enough to answer that question well though.
[18:14:23] <alphis> so JSON.stringify() takes an object as a param?
[18:14:26] <alphis> because thats what i have
[18:14:30] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:14:36] <robertmaxrees> alphis yes.  that takes an object and converts it to a string.
[18:14:53] <robertmaxrees> from the linked docs - â€œThe JSON.parse() method parses a string as JSON, optionally transforming the value produced by parsing.â€
[18:15:06] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong ones.
[18:15:26] <alphis> sounds like it takes a json string as input
[18:15:27] <alphis> from looking at it
[18:15:38] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify
[18:15:47] <robertmaxrees> this takes an object and converts it to a string.
[18:15:52] <tw2113> is there such thing as a json string?
[18:15:59] <robertmaxrees> a JSON formatted string, sure.
[18:16:10] <OmicroN-tablet> i fixed my weird problem from the other day..
[18:16:11] <tw2113> one that would create a valid json object yes
[18:16:16] <tw2113> but it's just a string at that point
[18:16:26] <BillCriswell> tw2113: TOO DEEP
[18:16:39] <tw2113> someone kick me in the nuts so i go up an octive
[18:16:41] <tw2113> sorry BillCriswell
[18:17:10] <BillCriswell> tw2113: That's the kind of question you ask in like.. ##javascript or something and cause a ruckus.
[18:17:12] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cuyqf3np/ <- JSON.stringify() in use
[18:17:28] <tw2113> i'm fine with starting a holy war or two
[18:17:29] <robertmaxrees> tw2113 part of the confusion is that JSON is not JavaScript.
[18:17:35] <tw2113> VIM AND EMACS BOTH SUCK! NANO FOR LIFE
[18:17:47] <OmicroN-tablet> ^
[18:17:49] <BillCriswell> tw2113: My mind went right to VIM as well.
[18:18:04] <robertmaxrees> but youâ€™re not user a parser combinator!!!
[18:18:06] <robertmaxrees> (jokes)
[18:18:11] <OmicroN-tablet> i agree with the nano master race
[18:18:26] <robertmaxrees> alphis did you see the example I gave you?
[18:18:29] <tw2113> chrome sucks, Firefox!
[18:18:38] <robertmaxrees> tw2113 i actually like FF >.>
[18:18:47] <OmicroN-tablet> that ones debatable :p
[18:19:01] <BillCriswell> I think they're equal enough...
[18:19:03] <tw2113> pop > soda > coke
[18:19:12] <alphis> robertmaxrees: i will try json.stringify(myobject);
[18:19:14] <robertmaxrees> tw2113 lives in the midwest.
[18:19:16] <alphis> thanks
[18:19:23] <tw2113> bestwest
[18:19:23] <robertmaxrees> alphis itâ€™s JSON <- case is important.
[18:19:45] <BillCriswell> Awwww, you two.
[18:19:48] <alphis> ok
[18:20:23] <tw2113> Radiohead have never been good, they just audibly mesmorize people to think it
[18:20:51] <robertmaxrees> well yeah basically.
[18:21:02] <tw2113> dirt > bacon
[18:23:00] <robertmaxrees> you killed it!
[18:23:23] <robertmaxrees> mmk have fun folks.
[18:23:34] <robertmaxrees> i need to go home and eat a food or three.
[18:33:12] <alphis> yeah JSON.stringify() failed lol
[18:39:22] <tejas-manohar> hey guys so https://github.com/tejas-manohar/gatekeeper
[18:39:39] <tejas-manohar> Redirect users to request GitHub access. by GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
[18:39:59] <tejas-manohar> How do I do this on click of an <a href>?
[18:40:21] <tejas-manohar> isnt GET default? so just href=â€œhttps://github.com/login/oauth/authorizeâ€
[18:40:26] <tejas-manohar> doesnt seem to work
[18:44:59] <alphis> since u guys can't visualize anything here is the jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/hh2wjf9y/1/
[18:45:23] <alphis> need to serialize the info object FFS
[18:45:34] <alphis> and JSON.stringify(info) FAILS COMPLETELY
[18:46:36] <BillCriswell> alphis: You have no idea what you're doing.
[18:47:16] <BillCriswell> alphis: http://jsfiddle.net/hh2wjf9y/2/
[18:47:23] <jrockjiggz> does $('div') === typoeof('object') ?
[18:47:32] <BillCriswell> alphis: You really have to relax.
[18:47:54] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: What?
[18:48:21] <sammych1> everything is an object!
[18:48:30] <systemfault> alphis: JS is not PHP, arrays are for numbered indexes
[18:48:31] <sammych1> typeof everything === 'object' // true
[18:48:48] <systemfault> sammych1: try   typeof 'hello'     in a console
[18:49:06] <alphis> systemfault: yeah i realize php does things completely retarded
[18:49:29] <jrockjiggz> I was wondering how to confirm $(this) is a jquery object and not anything else
[18:49:33] <sammych1> systemfault: yes, except for the obviate scalars
[18:50:51] <systemfault> alphis: http://jsfiddle.net/hh2wjf9y/3/
[18:50:53] <alphis> BillCriswell: yeah i tried BLAH=JSON.stringify(info); and got nothing
[18:51:11] <systemfault> alphis: Also, you need to declare your variables in JS.. or you create globals.
[18:52:02] <BillCriswell> alphis: http://jsfiddle.net/hh2wjf9y/4/
[18:52:52] <sammych1> can you use jQM so that it doesn't take over the whole page?
[18:53:04] <alphis> oh wait console.log isn't working either lol
[18:53:14] <alphis> does declaring it make console.log() not work in my case?
[18:53:18] <sammych1> I want to port an app into another page without using iFrames
[18:53:20] <alphis> because if so...webdev is for the birds
[18:53:28] <sammych1> (because iFrames are stupid on touch)
[18:53:56] <BillCriswell> alphis: Where are you trying to see the console?
[18:54:07] <BillCriswell> Did you go to the dev tools and all?
[18:54:38] <alphis> wow it DOES
[18:54:39] <sammych1> some libraries and websites actually replace console.* with function() {}
[18:54:44] <alphis> when i added info={} first
[18:54:52] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:54:54] <alphis> JSON.stringify() worked
[18:54:57] <alphis> without it it doesnt!
[18:54:58] <alphis> WOW...
[18:55:00] <alphis> i hate webdev
[18:55:03] <alphis> just fyi
[18:55:04] <BillCriswell> lol
[18:55:10] <alphis> so
[18:55:12] <alphis> why is that
[18:55:15] <alphis> im sure there's a reason
[18:55:19] <alphis> just can't imagine it being justified
[18:55:36] <BillCriswell> arrays don't have keys in Javascript.
[18:55:44] <alphis> so
[18:55:45] <alphis> theyre lists
[18:55:50] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:55:58] <alphis> thats...stupid.
[18:56:00] <alphis> but
[18:56:03] <sammych1> huh?
[18:56:09] <alphis> i guess every lang uses arrays diff
[18:56:13] <sammych1> that's the same paradigm in most langs?
[18:56:15] <alphis> php has an idiotic interp
[18:56:27] <alphis> no most langs have distinct lists/arrays
[18:56:33] <alphis> where arrays are interpreted as associative
[18:56:45] <alphis> in python list vs dict
[18:56:46] <sammych1> dictionary == objects
[18:56:49] <alphis> php everything == array
[18:56:51] <alphis> which is annoying
[18:56:56] <alphis> sometimes i just want a list
[18:57:15] <alphis> ok so...why did the declaring info={} make normal statements function when not adding it didn't
[18:57:33] <sammych1> I've not seen what you were trying to do
[18:57:41] <alphis> http://jsfiddle.net/hh2wjf9y/2/
[18:57:45] <alphis> first line is info={}
[18:57:46] <alphis> remove it
[18:57:52] <alphis> magically console.log fails
[18:57:53] <alphis> etc
[18:57:57] <alphis> i dont see why
[18:58:19] <Jattenalle> because it's not declared unless you do that
[18:58:39] <Jattenalle> implicit variable creation is.. touchy.. at best
[18:58:41] <sammych1> well, you're trying to put something somewhere that doesn't exist yet
[18:58:49] <sammych1> [] is an operator
[18:58:54] <sammych1> but you're operating on nothing
[18:59:11] <BillCriswell> alphis: Fatal errors I'd imagine?
[18:59:21] <BillCriswell> Oh, no errors.
[18:59:30] <BillCriswell> Just fails silently. No fun.
[18:59:37] <alphis> lol sammych1 this is javascript
[18:59:40] <alphis> its "dynamic"
[18:59:46] <alphis> yet when it fails to guess the type things like this occue
[18:59:54] <alphis> occur* which is why i prefer strictly typed langs
[19:00:05] <sammych1> you can't even do that in typed langs?
[19:00:16] <alphis> the ambiguity is unnecessary and causes stupid things like ^ to happen
[19:00:16] <sammych1> you never declared what info was
[19:00:29] <alphis> its javascript u dont need to define it
[19:00:34] <Jattenalle> what ambiguity? you didnt declare the variable
[19:00:36] <alphis> have u even used a scripting lang?
[19:00:36] <Jattenalle> yes you do
[19:00:40] <alphis> you never define types
[19:00:56] <sammych1> yeah but you didn't even declare the the variable to begin with
[19:00:58] <alphis> well not never
[19:00:59] <alphis> but u dont have to
[19:01:00] <Jattenalle> well, dude, that's just like... your personal opinion
[19:01:06] * Jattenalle abides
[19:01:09] <sammych1> it's like trying to access blah.blah.blah, where blah doesn't even exist
[19:01:15] <alphis> well if you disagree with the fact that u can say var x=5 and use it
[19:01:16] <alphis> ur retarded
[19:01:24] <alphis> my point is, they never define types
[19:01:30] <alphis> or seldom do
[19:01:32] <sammych1> you're looking up a key inside an object that doesn't exist yet
[19:01:40] <Jattenalle> var x=5; defines the type as number.. what are you on about?
[19:01:54] <alphis> you can x=5 no?
[19:01:58] <sammych1> I'm done feeding this troll.
[19:01:59] <Jattenalle> no
[19:02:12] <alphis> yes u can
[19:02:14] <alphis> in javascript
[19:02:18] <Jattenalle> you can't, that's implicit declaration, the interpreter will still add the var x=5; by its own
[19:02:22] <Jattenalle> however, that's not what you did
[19:02:25] <alphis> exactly
[19:02:29] <Jattenalle> you did: var y = x * 5;
[19:02:29] <alphis> it will automatically declare it
[19:02:35] <alphis> thats the nature of a dynamically typed lang
[19:02:37] <Jattenalle> and you're now pissy because y didnt magically become 25
[19:02:49] <droid909> guys, there is a plugin jcarousel, i use it in deffered object, where should i put  d.resolve(); upon its full initialization, because all the other code depends on it
[19:02:57] <Jattenalle> you were missing a variable, and you never told JS what it should be
[19:03:01] <alphis> no im pissed that not declaring something allows u to USE and assign it but it fails in unrelated things like printing it
[19:03:23] <droid909> i tried setupCallback but it doesn't seem like it ...
[19:03:34] <Jattenalle> well good luck with your project alphis
[19:04:28] <BillCriswell> alphis: I can understand that part of it. I would expect an error.
[19:04:39] <BillCriswell> Wonder why it doesn't. I might ask in ##javascript.
[19:04:57] <alphis> i agree
[19:05:06] <Jattenalle> i can console log implicit object creation just fine
[19:05:10] <Jattenalle> what browser are you using alphis?
[19:05:17] <alphis> just use the js fiddle
[19:05:21] <alphis> im using FF
[19:05:23] <Jattenalle> yeah, i did
[19:05:25] <Jattenalle> FF 31
[19:05:42] <alphis> if i dont declare info as an object it allows me to assign to it.
[19:05:51] <alphis> whats probably happening is its implicitly assuming its an array
[19:06:05] <Jattenalle> no, it always throws this error: ReferenceError: info is not defined
[19:06:24] <alphis> whats ur first line
[19:06:28] <alphis> didn't do that for me
[19:06:29] <alphis> at all
[19:06:35] <Jattenalle> info id = 5
[19:06:39] <Jattenalle> removed the declaration
[19:07:01] <Jattenalle> so it's behaving as expected
[19:07:25] <alphis> no i had it defined as an array initially
[19:08:01] <Jattenalle> if you add in info={}; it works fine
[19:08:09] <alphis> nope i had it defined as array
[19:08:10] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: I think it's more confusing that this happens but no error is given: var info = []; info.what = 'why can I do this?';
[19:08:13] <alphis> and it worked until converting
[19:08:24] <alphis> thanks BillCriswell
[19:08:25] <alphis> he will listen to u
[19:08:27] <alphis> lol
[19:08:29] <BillCriswell> without getting an error.
[19:08:31] <alphis> there is definitely a problem here
[19:08:49] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, yeah and im saying i get an error when doing [], or when not declaring at all.. no error when doing {}
[19:09:24] <Jattenalle> sorry, not error when doing []or {}
[19:09:51] <alphis> original post: http://jsfiddle.net/hh2wjf9y/1/
[19:09:56] <alphis> u can see i've defined it as an array
[19:10:08] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: I don't get an error in Chrome. :(
[19:10:15] <Jattenalle> the problem is that when you define it as an array, then try to stringify, it goes blindly by the length.. it doesnt care about the "hacked in" keys you added
[19:10:16] <alphis> however when u try to stringify it it just doesn't work
[19:10:24] <Jattenalle> you can access the individual keys just fine, but they're not part of the array list
[19:10:30] <Jattenalle> since well, you never added them to the array
[19:10:31] <alphis> well...
[19:10:33] <alphis> that sucks
[19:10:33] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Ahhh...
[19:10:42] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Now that makes sense to me.
[19:10:51] <Jattenalle> yeah, it's not broken, the code is just bad
[19:10:56] <alphis> lol
[19:11:03] <BillCriswell> So you can do [].what
[19:11:18] <alphis> so ur saying setting a field of an array...is somehow wrong
[19:11:21] <alphis> and wont get included
[19:11:33] <Jattenalle> info.data works fine for example, but you can never see that .data is a key in info, since info is an array and you never added it
[19:11:36] <alphis> info=new Array(); info['blah']=5; <-- why is that wrong
[19:11:41] <Jattenalle> alphis, you didnt set it
[19:11:55] <alphis> i defined info['data'] as a new array
[19:11:56] <alphis> is defined
[19:12:02] <alphis> then i pushed onto it
[19:12:06] <alphis> i'd expecet to see everything
[19:12:07] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: I got you.
[19:12:07] <Jattenalle> because that doesnt add to the array, that adds a new element/object to the info variable, OUTSIDE of the array
[19:12:29] <alphis> but that object is an element of the array
[19:12:35] <Jattenalle> you make info an array alphis, then outside of the array you add object elements
[19:12:38] <Jattenalle> no, it's not part of the array
[19:12:42] <Jattenalle> it's "outside" of the array
[19:12:51] <Jattenalle> because you're using a key, not an index
[19:13:02] <alphis> ok now im lost
[19:13:04] <alphis> i can do this in php
[19:13:07] <alphis> in fact thats the way to do it
[19:13:14] <alphis> i mean im sure ur right
[19:13:18] <Jattenalle> info is an array, info.data is an object element, NOT part of the array
[19:13:19] <alphis> but i dont see why this is the case
[19:13:35] <snover> arrays are numeric. objects are hash maps (â€œassociative arrayâ€)
[19:13:49] <alphis> so an array can't have string indices to objects?
[19:13:55] <Jattenalle> alphis, exactly
[19:13:56] <alphis> wtf is the point of an array
[19:13:59] <alphis> in js
[19:14:02] <Jattenalle> if you want string keys you just use an object
[19:14:05] <alphis> i guess u need object for this
[19:14:10] <alphis> i see
[19:14:10] <snover> array.push(1, 2, 3, 4)
[19:14:14] <snover> array.pop()
[19:14:16] <Jattenalle> that is the kind of questions that keep us all up at night ;) @ arrays purpose
[19:14:16] <snover> shift, unshift
[19:14:17] <snover> etc
[19:14:19] <alphis> thats...a rather important fact
[19:14:20] <snover> anything to do with a stack
[19:14:29] <OmicroN-tablet> lol
[19:14:47] <alphis> k given that rule regarding arrays that makes sense
[19:14:48] <Jattenalle> alphis, so when you define it with {}, which is an object, and later add keys to it, they get added to the object properly
[19:14:52] <alphis> objects are the way to go
[19:14:55] <snover> object: unordered collection of properties. array: ordered list of items
[19:15:11] <droid909> her http://jsfiddle.net/cL1tv6um/  renderMy() is a function that i use with .pipe()   belowe is the code for jcarousel plugin, for some reason the next .pipe fucntion doesn't wait for this plugin to render, am i doing something wrong?
[19:15:15] <droid909> here
[19:16:09] <BillCriswell> I thought doing like array.foo = "Bar" would be a definite error. Glad to read all that about it.
[19:16:25] <OmicroN-tablet> basically when you defined the variable as an array but called info["data" ] = 5 its basically the same as calling info.data = 5
[19:16:33] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, it's is pretty funky that you can have one variable, that is both an array and an object at the same time :3
[19:17:01] <Jattenalle> i mean, it makes sense, since technically stuff like .length etc are just object properties of that array
[19:17:02] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: That's what threw me the most.
[19:17:10] <Jattenalle> just not very obvious :P
[19:17:27] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[19:17:29] <BillCriswell> Interesting stuff.
[19:22:05] <alphis> by interesting
[19:22:11] <alphis> you mean stupidly designed
[19:22:12] <alphis> ;P
[19:22:20] <alphis> i hate that js operates the way it does
[19:22:25] <ZogDog> Boy do I have a doozy of a question!  Is it possible to include an input element as part of selected item?  For example, I'm using select2, but can I modify the results to include a small text entry next to it?
[19:22:39] <Jattenalle> not really, array traversing is much faster because it's limited to numeric indexes
[19:22:48] <alphis> im going to define an array thats an object thats an iframe thats a string and an int at the same time. then ask why this is possible ;]
[19:26:03] <snover> there is no mystery here. Array extends Object
[19:30:24] <b-lew_> http://jsfiddle.net/3Lb8up7g/ -> is there a reason why headerDivHeight doesn't resize on my .resize()?
[19:37:06] <Crucials> Im loading some elements into existance using ajax. I want to then bind some events to those elements. I think it should be something like $(parent).on('change'... but im not sure what next
[19:38:34] <sammych1> , 'selector', handler);
[19:38:41] <sammych1> 'selector' is optional
[19:38:53] <sammych1> if you want to capture all change events inside
[19:41:27] <Crucials> sammych1: is it ment to be something like this? http://hastebin.com/icubutovuf.coffee
[19:52:59] <Crucials> Never, got It i think. I underestimated jquery again
[19:53:07] <Crucials> nevermind*
[19:54:51] <b-lew_> http://jsfiddle.net/3Lb8up7g/ -> is there a way to get my headerDivHeight var to re-calculate on .resize?
[19:55:19] <b-lew_> right now it still thinks the height is the same on mobile.
[19:55:41] <b-lew_> but when I refresh it re-calculate and adjusts accordingly
[20:08:09] <Crucials> b-lew_:  it will recalculate, but it will always be $("header").height(); from what I see
[20:11:06] <b-lew_> right but for some reason the var doesn't update.
[20:11:22] <b-lew_> at least my nav doesn't move when the header does
[20:11:31] <b-lew_> maybe i'm approaching it the wrong wa.y
[20:13:43] <Crucials> b-lew_: what should be changing the header height?
[20:14:58] <b-lew_> yea
[20:15:15] <b-lew_> the header has a nav that goes mobile and the height adjusts
[20:15:41] <Crucials> right so something thats not in this js you linked
[20:15:47] <Crucials> is changing the height of the header
[20:15:59] <Crucials> ?
[20:16:48] <b-lew_> no I'm just hoping that var will update on .resize so the div will reposition below the header
[20:19:58] <Crucials> i just think you're missing a part of the logic there. Like the divHeight variable wont change because the header height is always the same
[20:20:13] <Crucials> so it does update, but won't actually be different
[20:23:39] <b-lew_> well the header height doesn't look the same to me... maybe I'm missing something but i'm unsure what.
[22:02:38] <Brycetron> Looking for someone experienced with basic html web development to help me with a test, much appreciated, thank you.
[22:19:18] <jrockjiggz> tip: if you want to output what HTML your object is: http://jsfiddle.net/pLLk5tLd/
[22:29:42] <Uhkis> or you know, ctrl+u :-D
[23:49:42] <K4T> can someone recommend plugin for maps with range spots?
