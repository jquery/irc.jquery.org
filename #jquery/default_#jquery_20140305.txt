[00:00:01] <axilaris> thanks lemme check
[00:00:03] <lng_> Hi guys! What should I use with jQuery.ajax(), success: or .done()?
[00:00:15] <Cork> axilaris: if you want to modify anything in the new fields do it on newSkill.find()
[00:00:23] <Cork> lng_: both work
[00:00:47] <Cork> lng_: done is nice if you want to allow parties outside the calling function to hook in
[00:00:53] <dismist> i believe success is a term thrown out there very loosely by the jquery developers.  i think complete is a much more politically correct event handler
[00:01:12] <dismist> well, logistically correct
[00:01:15] <Cork> lng_: function newData() { return $.ajax(); } newData().done(function() {})
[00:01:17] <axilaris> ok thanks
[00:01:30] <Cork> dismist: please stop trolling...
[00:01:48] <lng_> Cork: thanks!
[00:01:48] <dismist> done, however, does not suggest the response was 200 or otherwise
[00:02:04] <dismist> whereas the aforementioned eventhandlers may, no?
[00:02:13] <slax0r> Cork: solved my problem yesterday, went from all server-side gplus login to a hybrid system :)
[00:02:27] <Cork> :)
[00:02:34] <Cork> slax0r: nice
[00:06:09] <lng_> I need to send { 'id': 2, 'value': 'X' } JSON with no key, but it is transformed to id=2&value=X. How can I do it? http://jsfiddle.net/p834t/
[00:06:37] <Cork> lng_: data: JSON.stringify({ 'id': 2, 'value': 'X' }),
[00:06:41] <larsemil> i have a div with 4 visible elements out of a bunch, and i want to fade out one and then fade in and not rearrange the items. is there any nice plugin or any better way to do it?
[00:06:59] <Cork> lng_: if you give it an object jquery will convert it to params not json
[00:07:08] <larsemil> fadeout item nr 2, fade in item nr 8 in item nr 2 slot
[00:08:11] <Cork> larsemil: so you want to visibly move nr 8 before nr 6
[00:08:14] <Cork> but not in the dom?
[00:08:18] <Cork> you can't really do that
[00:08:26] <Cork> you would have to absolute position all elements
[00:08:26] <larsemil> in the dom would be okay.
[00:08:41] <Cork> then you don't really need a plugin
[00:08:53] <Cork> just use insertAfter
[00:08:59] <larsemil> i mean i dont want the items to be visibly move, if i take out nr 2 i dont want nr 3 to jump left
[00:09:16] <lng_> Cork: thanks!
[00:09:20] <Cork> larsemil: again that is kinda hard
[00:09:41] <Cork> larsemil: you could add a place holder around the element as you animate it
[00:09:44] <Cork> to hold it's place
[00:09:57] <Cork> else ya, you would have to absolute position all the elements
[00:10:13] <Cork> (and absolute positioning all of it sucks
[00:11:09] <Cork> weeee
[00:11:09] <pjppj> gayquery lets you access the dong
[00:12:02] <pjppj> gayquery lets you access the dong
[00:15:56] <jl2753> Hey guys - I'm trying to use ajax to load content, but only the first and every other request works. I've tried e.preventDefault() but the page is still reloading and there are no errors in console. Any thoughts? http://dpaste.com/1689408/
[00:21:37] <larsemil> Cork: what about fading content out and in at the same time?
[00:21:47] <larsemil> i need positioning again i realize
[00:21:52] <larsemil> to stack them on top of each other
[00:22:07] <Cork> larsemil: you mean crossfade?
[00:22:14] <larsemil> yes i guess.
[00:22:28] <Cork> one should fade out and another should fade on in the same location
[00:22:37] <larsemil> yes.
[00:22:50] <Cork> ya you need to tinker there too
[00:23:00] <larsemil> yes i realize.
[00:23:23] <Cork> larsemil: simplest is prob to have each position hold by a wrapper
[00:23:33] <Cork> the wrapper has the fixed size
[00:23:44] <Cork> the content inside it is position: absolute
[00:23:51] <larsemil> yes! that would work.
[00:23:54] <Cork> and the wrapper is position: relative
[00:24:01] <larsemil> i have wrapper aldready so that will be perfect.
[00:24:04] <Cork> then you should be able to do all the solutions you've talked about
[00:24:18] <Cork> all you need to do is move the visible elements between the wrappers
[00:24:18] <larsemil> thanks. will be perfect.
[00:27:50] <alabd> Good day all , is it really xss?or false positive ? http://upload7.ir/imgs/2014-03/67360207234115719978.png
[00:28:32] <dismist> taboo
[00:28:37] <Cork> alabd: possibly
[00:29:03] <Cork> alabd: you should always try to stay up to date with the patch versions
[00:29:07] <alabd> Cork: but howmit's possible
[00:29:35] <Cork> alabd: i'm not up to date with what happened back there so can't fully say
[00:29:50] <Cork> alabd: but it might be something with jsonp for example (just wildly guessing)
[00:30:15] <alabd> thanks , anyone knows details
[00:30:51] <Cork> alabd: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/09/01/jquery-1-6-3-released/
[00:30:55] <Cork> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9521
[00:31:18] <jl2753> if ajax works only every other time even though e.preventDefault(); is on, is there anything I should try?
[00:31:22] <Cork> alabd: check the highlights in the first link
[00:31:48] <Cork> jl2753: what do you mean by "works"?
[00:32:07] <Cork> jl2753: i would start by checking what happens in the network tab in the browsers developer tools
[00:32:39] <jl2753> Cork: I'm fetching content from another URL using ajax and it works the first time then every other time becomes a full page reload and then ajax works again.
[00:33:05] <Cork> jl2753: and when it doesn't work do you get any network traffic?
[00:33:41] <jl2753> Cork: i do, it's as if the URL in the 'href' was clicked
[00:35:31] <Cork> jl2753: put a breakpoint in the event and make sure it is fired
[00:35:52] <Cork> jl2753: one option might be you have multiple elements with the same id for example
[00:36:11] <Cork> jl2753: actually ya, i would start with validating the generated html from after the first click
[00:36:19] <Cork> (save the dom to a html file and validate it)
[00:37:49] <jl2753> Cork: let me go try that, makes sense
[00:57:09] <jl2753> Cork: validation was fine. turns out that... i forgot to call the function again after the first ajax response -.-
[00:57:31] <Cork> jl2753: you might want to use a delegated event listener
[00:58:18] <Cork> jl2753: $('parent-the-ajax-doesn't-replace').on('click', 'element-you-click', function() {})
[00:58:56] <alabd> Cork: or http://watchitlater.com/blog/2011/10/cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-with-javascript-and-jquery/    , i think this will be risk while app get text from user not always ..yes ?
[00:59:47] <jl2753> yeah i'll do that seems like much cleaner code than to call every function for content I've replaced
[01:00:11] <Cork> alabd: like the releasenotes i linked to said it is about using $(location.hash)
[01:02:01] <alabd> Cork: thanks
[01:02:33] <Cork> np
[01:10:16] <jl2753> Cork: thx for the help! set up the delegated event listener, everything works fine now
[01:11:16] <jim87> hello! Do any of you have experience with Fancybox? I'm experiencing a bad behavior: when I open an iframed box, it will scroll everything on top... see: http://giacomofurlan.name/sanfelice/#lavori-in-corso - javascript: http://giacomofurlan.name/sanfelice/main.js - thanks for any suggestion!
[01:11:47] <jim87> ops, it's http://giacomofurlan.name/sanfelice/js/main.js
[01:12:48] <Cork> jim87: everything as the orignal page?
[01:12:54] <Cork> *as in the
[01:13:29] <jim87> Cork: sorry, click on any link in the "lavori in corso" section, for example "Verde"
[01:13:57] <Cork> don't see any scrolling
[01:14:41] <jim87> Cork: at least on Chrome, when the iframe appears, the page returns on top (the section with a background image)
[01:15:18] <Cork> ah
[01:15:24] <Cork> ya, now i see it
[01:16:41] <jim87> if I set overlay.locked to false, it won't behave like this, but it will allow the body to scroll, which is not what I want... and overlay.locked = true is the default behavior
[01:16:48] <Cork> jim87: also if you want to diagnose it, don't use minified js
[01:17:34] <jim87> Cork: yep indeed I was going to use the un-minified version - btw it's strange, as it seems to work fine on the demo page
[01:21:53] <jim87> Cork: dunno if proper solution, but I've hidden the overflow-y body's scroll via callback/css
[01:22:20] <jim87> (when the iframe popups, disabling the overlay.locked helper)
[01:22:55] <Cork> jim87: ya, don't know it well enough to tell what happens
[01:23:10] <larsemil> what could be the reason that when i do fadeout on an object it does not fade, only hide?
[01:23:42] <jim87> larsemil: have you entered some milliseconds, like 500?
[01:23:49] <larsemil> i have "slow"
[01:24:03] <Cork> larsemil: opacity: 1 !important for example
[01:32:40] <larsemil> Cork: http://hjul.dalnix.se/ in the console run the command randomize(); and see one of the images in bottom NOT fade out. ;)
[01:40:27] <Cork> larsemil: .hide().fadeOut() won't fade it out
[01:40:34] <Cork> (line 76)
[01:41:05] <Cork> larsemil: also .appendTo(jQuery(outPic)) can be converted to .appendTo(outPic)
[01:41:18] <Cork> no need for the extra wrapper
[01:41:29] <larsemil> Cork: but i am hiding the object i want to fade in.
[01:41:35] <larsemil> on line 76
[01:42:18] <Cork> larsemil: well ofadeout is already display: none
[01:42:22] <Cork> so it can't fade out
[01:42:50] <Cork> ah
[01:42:53] <Cork> i see what happens
[01:43:00] <Cork> larsemil: append doesn't clone the element
[01:43:02] <Cork> it moves it
[01:43:12] <Cork> so ofadeout and ofadein is the same element
[01:43:25] <Cork> ?api clone
[01:43:25] <b-ot> Cork: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[01:44:00] <Cork> hmm no hmm
[01:44:17] * Cork starts the function over again
[01:44:32] <larsemil> Cork: really? on line 73 i grab the object to fadeout.
[01:44:56] <larsemil> Cork: on line 76 i move the object that is to be faded in. I also hide it.
[01:45:02] <leur> hey guys need some help, how can i set a directly url-link for jquery tab?
[01:45:52] <Cork> larsemil: ya, but on line 77 you append fadeout to inPic and it is display none
[01:46:06] <Cork> larsemil: leading to the now moved thumbnail to be hidden
[01:46:18] <Cork> meaning fadeOut won't have anything to do
[01:47:56] <larsemil> its the same if i remove the append bit. :(
[01:48:45] <Cork> jim87: wrong append bit :)
[01:49:02] <Cork> jim87: and ya i said 76 before it was 77
[01:49:13] <Cork> jQuery(inPic).append(ofadeout); <--
[01:49:30] <larsemil> yes. thtas the one i removed.
[01:49:56] <jim87> Cork: wrong append and wrong nick I suppose :P
[01:50:15] <larsemil> jim87: guess you just faded into discussion
[01:50:28] <jim87> rofl
[01:50:30] <Cork> >_<
[01:51:31] <Cork> larsemil: transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out 0s;
[01:51:59] <Cork> so the browser will fight with jquery over who should animate the opacity value
[01:54:17] <larsemil> Cork: finally. thanks. missed that one.
[01:55:18] <Cork> larsemil: ya, those are a bit tricky to find
[01:55:28] <larsemil> thanks alot man. you the hero!
[01:55:30] <larsemil> <3
[01:56:01] <Cork> heh np
[02:05:02] <lng_> The value variable in fail() function is not accessible out of it. How to fix it? I need to return error instead:   https://gist.github.com/lngphp/a7916384cd3820e7bfa2
[02:05:48] <Uhkis> return it instead of saving it?
[02:06:13] <xKraty> or var value; at first line
[02:06:58] <lng_> Uhkis: when I return it, the last return returns another value
[02:07:41] <Cork> you can't return
[02:07:59] <Cork> return would imply that the code is synchronous
[02:08:05] <Cork> and ajax isn't
[02:08:27] <Cork> lng_: best way is to return the deferred object from $.ajax instead
[02:08:35] <Cork> and have the caller use .fail it self
[02:08:40] <lng_> Cork: trying that
[02:08:48] <Cork> or create your own deferred object
[02:09:00] <Cork> if you need to modify the value before forwarding it
[02:09:26] <lng_> Cork: yes, I need to show an error in case of failure, otherwise, original value
[02:09:45] <Cork> ?api jQuery.Deferred
[02:09:45] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[02:09:49] <Cork> ?api jDeferred
[02:09:50] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[02:09:52] <Cork> sigh
[02:10:15] <Cork> lng_: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[02:12:42] <lng_> Cork: any code example?
[02:12:49] <Cork> in the page
[02:14:43] <lng_> Cork: is not fail() deffered in my example?
[02:14:56] <Cork> lng_: sure
[02:15:11] <Cork> but like i said, if you want to modify what is transmitted through the callback
[02:15:17] <Cork> you need to create your own deferred
[02:15:31] <Cork> if you don't then you can just use the deferred ajax create
[02:16:16] <lng_> Cork: I'm not so familiar with it
[02:16:32] <lng_> Cork: if you have any example, that would really help
[02:16:41] <Cork> lng_: example of what?
[02:17:17] <lng_> Cork: of creation of deferred for example
[02:17:36] <Cork> lng_: there is examples of that in the api page i linked
[02:18:32] <lng_> Cork: you mean here? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[02:18:54] <Cork> hmm ya, but... looks like they moved them...
[02:18:59] <Cork> one min let me see if i can find them
[02:19:03] <Trisox> sup cork
[02:19:09] <lng_> Cork: thanks
[02:19:16] <Trisox> been a while
[02:19:20] <Arnoud> ./AdmireNL
[02:19:27] <Cork> lng_: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[02:19:31] <Trisox> haha goed  bezig Arnoud zonder punt
[02:19:40] <Cork> Trisox: it has
[02:19:44] <Trisox> yep
[02:20:18] <Arnoud> hey Tripod
[02:20:20] <Trisox> :D
[02:20:36] <Trisox[away]> ./nick Trisox[away]
[02:20:43] <Cork> lng_: basically you call resolve() to trigger .done and .reject to trigger .fail
[02:21:38] <Trisox> AdmireNL whatsup
[02:32:51] <lng_> Cork: I don't get it, sorry.
[02:33:43] <Cork> lng_: what part don't you get?
[02:34:39] <lng_> Cork: I don't understand how to adjust it for my specific case
[02:34:52] <Cork> lng_: you don't adjust it
[02:35:04] <Cork> you create a deferred object return in
[02:35:14] <Cork> and when you want to trigger you use resolve or reject
[02:36:06] <Cork> lng_: the example in .done should explain it well enough
[02:38:05] <lng_> Cork: okay, thanks - I will play  with it
[02:39:36] <roxlu> hi! I'm trying to put a couple of vine embeds into a bootstrap carousel, but only the first video is visible. the other embeds set a height = 0 for the container around the video player. Does someone maybe knows a possible fix for this?
[02:47:31] <axilaris> hi guys, can help me out a bit... i'ved made this script for dynamic forms http://jsfiddle.net/q2wPK/1/. the preloaded fields somehow are at the top of the fix fields.. click on "Add Variable", you'll know what i mean... http://jsfiddle.net/q2wPK/1/ how to get it below the fix field onload ?

[03:10:26] <Cork> don't forget the latex gloves before you start coding!
[03:15:52] <axilaris> hi Cork, could u help again... how do i make sure the javascript fields are after the static fields on load ? http://jsfiddle.net/q2wPK/1/
[03:16:21] <Cork> ?api append
[03:16:22] <b-ot> Cork: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[03:16:28] <Cork> compared

[03:16:32] <b-ot> Cork: .prepend(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[03:16:44] <axilaris> ok
[03:17:14] <Cork> hmm
[03:17:20] <Cork> actually you have other things at the end
[03:17:44] <Cork> try something like insertBefore($('#addVar').closest('p'))
[03:17:47] <Cork> or
[03:17:56] <Cork> try something like $('#addVar').closest('p').before()
[03:19:34] <axilaris> ok... let me try.. js is something im still having difficulties handling...
[03:24:39] <axilaris> ah.. took me a while... this works $('form').append($node);
[03:24:54] <axilaris> http://jsfiddle.net/q2wPK/2/
[03:25:10] <axilaris> im not sure how u do the insertbefore or closest
[03:25:47] <axilaris> oh but the append is after the submit button

[03:32:35] <Trisox> Cork hahaha
[03:32:56] <Trisox> Cork 18% identified 'Blu-ray' as a marine animal
[03:33:00] <Trisox> omg
[03:33:05] <Cork> ya
[03:33:14] <Trisox> lol  23% thought MP3 was a Star Wars robot
[03:33:18] <Trisox> damn
[03:33:47] <Trisox> idiots
[03:33:50] <Trisox> :D
[03:34:47] <Cork> well not really idiots, but it is still funny when you know the answer
[03:37:16] <Trisox> Cork true but i mean blue-ray is kinda common knowledge
[03:37:19] <Trisox> i would say
[03:37:33] <Cork> and mp3 isn't?
[03:37:36] <Trisox> also
[03:37:51] <Cork> mp3 has been around three times as long a bluray
[03:38:01] <Cork> (if not even more)
[03:38:20] <Cork> mp3 came around 93
[03:38:25] <Cork> not sure about blueray
[03:38:37] <Trisox> true since 1998 napstar time
[03:39:44] <Cork> what?
[03:39:51] <Cork> blueray isn't since 98
[03:39:58] <Cork> dvd came somewhere around then
[03:40:07] <Trisox> no mp3
[03:40:18] <Cork> mp3 existed long before napster
[03:40:31] <Cork> mp3 was 91 - 93
[03:40:31] <Trisox> i know
[03:40:39] <Trisox> but not to the "public"
[03:40:54] <Cork> mp3 player (hardware) existed before napster
[03:41:13] <Trisox> yep but was nerd toy
[03:41:19] <Trisox> mostly
[03:41:26] <Cork> true
[03:41:37] <Cork> but it was quite well known around here
[03:41:43] <Cork> not but much though
[03:41:50] <Trisox> same here
[03:41:57] <Cork> *not by much
[03:42:17] <Trisox> then you got your .wma .wav files
[03:42:35] <Cork> don't forget .mod!
[03:42:44] <Cork> it was the big thing before mp3
[03:42:53] <Trisox> no midi
[03:42:53] <Trisox> :D
[03:42:55] * Cork still has a big .mod archive :)
[03:43:03] <Trisox> for real :D
[03:43:05] <Cork> midi wasn't really ever something big
[03:43:20] <Cork> as it is just notes not sound
[03:44:30] <Cork> heck at the beginning midi files needed a midi ship in the sound card for you to be able to play it :D
[03:45:02] <Trisox> friend of mine got a piano in his restaurant who plays midi files
[03:45:04] <Trisox> hehe
[03:45:40] <Cork> heh
[03:45:46] <Trisox> one of them who's key's move when no one is sitting behind it... it works on old school floppy's :D haha
[03:45:54] <Trisox> kinda cool!
[03:47:26] <iaj_> Hi there :)
[03:48:19] <iaj_> Is there a way to have a jQuery call, that selects an image, and sets an <a href="..."> around it if there's no around it yet, and elseway updates the href target?
[03:49:28] <Cork> iaj: something like $('img').not('a > img').wrap('<a>') should work
[03:49:52] <Cork> actually that could create invalid dom
[03:50:05] <Cork> iaj: $('img').not('a img').wrap('<a>') should be safer
[04:02:11] <iaj_> Cork: thanks! That worked :)
[04:21:48] <ska-fan> How do I get all inputs that don't have a parent with class empty-form?
[04:22:56] <Cork> ska-fan: selecting on the absense of a class is a bit unreliable
[04:23:07] <Cork> i recommend adding a class for it if you can
[04:23:53] <Cork> ska-fan: but you could do a double select if you can't
[04:24:09] <anli__> I want some kind of set that can have object identities as keys, and to be able to see if an object is in that set? Is a linear array they only way to go in js?
[04:24:11] <Cork> $('input').not('.empty-form input')
[04:24:34] <ska-fan> Cork: Thanks, that looks good! What's unreliable about it?
[04:24:53] <Cork> ska-fan: that one isn't unreliable, but you first have to build a list of all inputs
[04:24:59] <Cork> then find all that has the class
[04:25:07] <lng_> Why do I get undefined when console.log(deferred.status): http://pastebin.com/gK3De42S If it is undefined, why does it exist at the right side http://i.imgur.com/ly5FYUF.png ?
[04:25:09] <Cork> and then remove the ones that exist in both
[04:25:23] <Cork> ska-fan: so it is a bit messy
[04:25:50] <Cork> ska-fan: what i meant is when you use something like $(':not(.empty-form) input')
[04:26:02] <Cork> cause those will match any parent that doesn't have the class
[04:26:10] <Cork> so you get all kind of weird matches
[04:26:46] <Cork> lng_: deferred isn't an array
[04:26:56] <Cork> so you can't use each on it
[04:27:02] <ska-fan> Cork: Ah, ok. Thanks! :)
[04:27:35] <Cork> ska-fan: but like i said adding classes for the situations you want to select normally results in cleaner code
[04:28:16] <lng_> Cork: but each is printing it as you see on the left
[04:28:54] <lng_> Cork: just need to get status somehow
[04:29:11] <Cork> well hat you have on the right is when you inspect the object
[04:29:15] <lng_> Cork: don't understand why it is printed at the right side
[04:29:24] <Cork> and as it has access to the object you see the value as they change
[04:29:48] <Cork> what you have on the left is just keys from the object
[04:30:11] <lng_> why is status missing on the left?
[04:30:18] <Cork> cause it doesn't exist yet
[04:30:31] <Cork> you need to wait for fail or done to fire
[04:30:54] <lng_> Cork: my problem is $('td .editable', oTable.fnGetNodes()).editable(function(value, settings) {} must return a value
[04:31:11] <Cork> lng_: then you can't use ajax with it
[04:31:13] <lng_> Cork: so I need to change it in case of error
[04:31:34] <Cork> plugins that are written to use return values
[04:31:44] <Cork> have't though about async code
[04:32:19] <Cork> at least if you don't have second way to set the value
[04:32:21] <lng_> Cork: this ajax code could be url as well
[04:32:33] <Cork> what?
[04:33:04] <Cork> lng_: there is one way you can return the value like you want
[04:33:12] <Cork> but it has a LONG list of drawbacks
[04:33:22] <Cork> you can set the browser to use sync ajax calls
[04:33:26] <lng_> Cork: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable / Submitting to function instead of URL
[04:33:38] <Cork> but know that it means the browser will hang until a response comes from the server
[04:33:44] <Cork> you can't do any updates on the page at all
[04:33:55] <ska-fan> How do I easily get the intersection of two jquery selections?
[04:33:58] <Cork> new ajax features isn't available to this old legacy solution
[04:34:12] <lng_> Cork: I need it to be a funtion because this plugin can't send JSON with no ney
[04:34:22] <lng_> key*
[04:34:24] <Cork> ska-fan: jqobj1.filter(jqobj2)
[04:34:55] <lng_> Cork: this plugin is so hard to use
[04:35:18] <Cork> lng_: well ya if it demands you to return the value i would look for an alternative
[04:35:23] <ska-fan> Cork: Thanks again! I knew filter already but wasn't aware it could be used like that as well
[04:36:03] <Cork> ska-fan: and .not does the same thing but it excludes the intersection instead
[04:36:11] <Cork> (from obj1 that is)
[04:37:41] <Cork> lng_: btw why don't you use the submitdata callback?
[04:37:52] <Cork> it might be able to do what you want
[04:38:06] <dan2k3k4k5> what would be the best way to setup a "global.js" file (for use in all projects) and a project specific "project.js" file (loaded after global) where I would want to use whatever object I define in global and either override or implement certain functions specific to each project
[04:38:55] <Cork> lng_: alternatively the data function
[04:39:02] <Cork> but ya, don't know the plugin
[04:39:21] <dan2k3k4k5> i.e. global.js => globalObj = function() {} then project.js => projObj = globalObj; projObj.prototype.newFunc = function() {}; ?
[04:39:30] <lng_> Cork: well, there's one issue with it - it sends keyed data
[04:39:44] <Cork> lng_: even if you return a string from them?
[04:40:06] <lng_> Cork: return string from where?
[04:40:21] <Cork> dan2k3k4k5: $.extend would prob help with what you want to do
[04:40:27] <Cork> lng_: the function
[04:40:47] <lng_> Cork: sorry which funtion?
[04:41:17] <Cork> prob the data function
[04:41:28] <Cork> as it sounds like submitdata just append things
[04:41:31] <lng_> Cork: I need to try mmt
[04:41:40] <lng_> Cork: ah yes it does append
[04:42:15] <dan2k3k4k5> Cork, ah, hmm $.extend is pretty good
[04:42:25] <Cork> lng_: but you should take as a rule to always read the extension before you use it
[04:42:28] <Cork> so you know what it does
[04:42:39] <Cork> and actually not use it if you don't understand it
[04:42:48] <Cork> cause the day it breaks and you need to fix it
[04:43:04] <Cork> it sucks if you can't understand the code and have a broken page
[04:43:07] <lng_> Cork: yea
[04:43:23] <Cork> s/extension/plugin/
[04:47:52] <lng_> Cork: I tried this approach as well - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12010786/how-to-send-json-put-with-jeditable
[04:48:24] <lng_> Cork: but using data is causing JSON to be shown in the input
[04:48:51] <Cork> lng_: can't really help you without reading the plugin source then
[04:49:59] <lng_> Cork: https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_jeditable/blob/master/jquery.jeditable.js
[04:50:12] <ska-fan> Cork: I can put .not() in the selector expression directly with :not. How do I do that with .filter()?
[04:50:15] <lng_> Cork: if you can take a look at it of course
[04:50:53] <Cork> ska-fan: you can't really use :not either
[04:51:02] <Cork> cause it gives the wrong effect like i said before
[04:51:18] <Cork> and there is no support for filter there as far as i know
[04:51:35] <Cork> ah wait
[04:51:40] <Cork> ya you can use :not inline
[04:53:15] <Cork> lng_: no i don't have the time to learn how the plugin sticks together
[04:53:21] <Cork> it would take too much time
[04:53:55] <lng_> Cork: thanks anyway
[04:55:03] <jop008> $('#countryID').change(function() { how to activate this? $('#countryID').trigger ("change") ?
[04:55:14] <Cork> yes
[04:55:28] <Cork> or $('#countryID').change() works too
[04:55:36] <Cork> but what you typed is normally the more readable code
[04:57:02] <lng_> How to convert JSON string to an object?
[04:57:17] <Cork> JSON.parse()
[04:57:33] <lng_> thanks
[04:58:03] <Cork> lng_: if you need to use it your server is missconfigured though
[04:58:22] <Cork> cause then the server sets the wrong content-type header
[05:05:30] <lng_> Cork: no, it is not misconfigured. I need to add datatype
[05:05:50] <lng_> Cork: probably, it might work like this: https://gist.github.com/lngphp/783ae56a89632663f37e
[05:06:09] <lng_> Cork: line 9 - I need to change DOM
[05:06:16] <Cork> ah for fail
[05:06:25] <Cork> ya, fail doesn't parse by default
[05:07:23] <ska-fan> Cork: Could you /accept me?
[05:08:01] <Cork> accept?
[05:08:20] <lng> Cork: have you messaged anything? My IRSSI died
[05:08:29] <ska-fan> Cork: /accept ska-fan
[05:08:54] <Cork> lng: only <Cork> ah for fail <Cork> ya, fail doesn't parse by default
[05:09:00] <Cork> ska-fan: what am i to accept?
[05:09:27] <lng> Cork: how do I change text to error in fail()?
[05:09:50] <ska-fan> Cork: private messages from me
[05:10:28] <Cork> lng: like i said before; you can't
[05:10:48] <Cork> return "error"; isn't possible to do from .fail
[05:11:02] <lng> Cork: no, no
[05:11:26] <Cork> ska-fan: please no pm
[05:11:30] <lng> Cork: I return value as before, but in fail, I need to change it
[05:11:36] <Cork> unless a reason for it has been found
[05:11:50] <Cork> lng: ok lets back up this a bit
[05:11:56] <lng> Cork: sure
[05:11:57] <Cork> sounds like you still miss the problem
[05:12:11] <Cork> to take that last gist and make an execution flow order for it
[05:12:22] <Cork> 1. the callback is called (line 1)
[05:12:41] <Cork> 2. $.ajax is and an ajax call is queued
[05:12:54] <Cork> 3. fail is bound on the ajax deferred object
[05:12:57] <basiclaser> hey guys, does the value change for you when you click on the number? http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/LaPfG/9/
[05:12:59] <Cork> 3. return value; fires
[05:13:08] <Cork> 4. the ajax call happens
[05:13:08] <ska-fan> Cork: I want to pay you for code review if you're interested.
[05:13:19] <Cork> 5. if the ajax call fails the alert triggers
[05:13:35] <Cork> lng: cause of this as you see you can't modify the value for the return
[05:13:49] <Cork> lng: cause it happend several steps before fail even fires
[05:14:26] <Cork> basiclaser: don't use strings for setTimeout
[05:14:54] <lng> Cork: wait a min
[05:15:03] <lng> Cork: my idea is different
[05:16:36] <lng> Cork: I don't want to modify return value anymore, but want to change DOM - $(this).text(error)
[05:16:52] <lng> to change it in fail
[05:17:55] <Cork> basiclaser: also you define switchClick in onload so you can't access it from an event attribute
[05:18:38] <Cork> lng: well if "this" is from the callback you need to store it
[05:18:51] <Cork> cause it will change in the fail callback
[05:19:01] <lng> Cork: yep
[05:19:02] <Cork> var self = this; before the ajax call should fix that
[05:19:21] <Cork> then you can just do the line you showed except using self instead of this
[05:20:16] <Yeretik> Hi... Can anybody tell me what plugin i need to get this zoom effect on hover?  --> http://demo.cosmothemes.com/diablo-dark/
[05:20:42] <lng> Cork: exactly what I meant
[05:21:36] <Cork> Yeretik: none
[05:21:43] <Cork> it uses transition
[05:21:56] <basiclaser> Cork: thankyou
[05:22:01] <Yeretik> Cork, Thanks
[05:22:11] <basiclaser> Cork: should it work after those thwo changes it doesnt seem to work for me
[05:22:28] <Cork> basiclaser: no i couldn't get it working
[05:22:34] <Cork> let me have another look
[05:23:43] <Cork> basiclaser: when you call updateTime the first time switchValue is 2
[05:24:00] <Cork> in the switch case you don't trigger any timeouts if that happens
[05:24:15] <Cork> and you don't call updateTime from switchClick
[05:25:16] <Cork> basiclaser: so ya, the code runs once on start and then it's basically dead code
[05:25:24] <lng> Cork: it works finally - https://gist.github.com/lngphp/783ae56a89632663f37e
[05:25:47] <Cork> nice
[05:27:38] <basiclaser> Cork: yeh i saw that too, its just in fiddle, my local version ticks away fine. I can get it to update on click > http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/LaPfG/14/ but still no cycling of decimal amounts
[05:28:46] <Cork> basiclaser: setTimeout(updateTime(), 1000); => setTimeout(updateTime, 1000);
[05:28:57] <Cork> setTimeout(updateTime(), 1000); will send the return value from updateTime
[05:29:01] <Cork> not the actual function
[05:31:27] <Cork> basiclaser: http://jsfiddle.net/LaPfG/15/ works here on click though
[05:32:11] <Cork> uh
[05:33:53] <Cork> basiclaser: is this what your looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/LaPfG/16/
[05:34:08] <Cork> you defined switchValue as an attribute in switchClick
[05:34:26] <Cork> so you never touched the global variable
[05:34:41] <Cork> basiclaser: also always define variables
[05:34:58] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/LaPfG/17/
[05:40:52] <ska-fan> Cork: If you're interested contact me at mbertheau at gmail.com :)
[05:41:37] <Cork> ska-fan: na, just ask a question if you want a hint
[05:43:05] <ska-fan> Cork: Yeah, no, it's a code review of https://github.com/mbertheau/jquery.django-formset/blob/master/src/django-formset.js or the respective .coffee file. I guess that's to big a question :)
[05:43:31] <nFFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/UtZVt/1/ - trying to increase/decrease size/scale of image - any help?
[05:43:36] <guyz> Does anyone know the proper term (and also any examples) of what I can only describe as a rolling-pin select wheel (that continually loops around, similar to how a slot machine works)
[05:43:52] <Cork> ska-fan: i most likely wouldn't be a good reviewer
[05:43:57] <Cork> as i don't use django
[05:44:14] <Cork> all i can answer is generic js and jquery things
[05:44:21] <Cork> and that isn't really enough for a review
[05:45:13] <Cork> nFFFF: i would recommend doing it in css instead
[05:46:53] <nFFFF> can you show on jsfiddle cork?
[05:46:56] <Cork> hmm
[05:47:05] <Cork> ah you want to scale from the original size
[05:47:12] <Cork> you can't really do that
[05:47:42] <Cork> hmm unless calc can do it
[05:48:02] <ska-fan> Cork: I still think I could learn something. I know that the plugin works because I use it, so the Django part is fine. However this is my first serious venture into JS and jQuery, so I think I'd still benefit from your review. Anyways - thanks d)
[05:49:38] <basiclaser> Cork: woohoo i got it working!
[05:50:04] <basiclaser> its a bit spazzy though, ive played with the code abit to get it to behave when it cycles through its decimals
[05:50:07] <basiclaser> check it out
[05:50:11] <basiclaser> http://jsfiddle.net/LaPfG/17/
[05:50:12] <Cork> nFFFF: hmm no calc can't help
[05:51:12] <Cork> nFFFF: only way to do what you want is to load the image in an <img> or <canvas> and crab the dimentions from there
[06:08:40] <HelperW> Yo,
[06:08:54] <HelperW> I am trying to get the values of a select options HTML element.
[06:10:15] <HelperW> http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/ta
[06:10:18] <HelperW> What am I doing wrong?
[06:11:02] <anli__> Can I compare an object against NaN?
[06:11:10] <nFFFF> Cork, what am I missing, http://jsfiddle.net/UtZVt/2/
[06:11:13] <anli__> against => with
[06:11:15] <nFFFF> brain isnt working today
[06:12:03] <HelperW> anli__ : TypeOff NaN = Number not object.
[06:12:24] <anli__> if (typeof(a) == "NaN") then?
[06:12:38] <HelperW> Try it : )
[06:13:48] <HelperW> Anyone suggestions for my problem with my select options? I would like to select the current active item.
[06:14:52] <anli__> Got number, so what I need to do is to if (typeof(a) == "number" && isNaN(a))
[06:15:13] <Cork> nFFFF: body.css("background-size") will give you a string
[06:15:47] <Cork> so ex. currentSite+10 + "px" == "304px auto10px"
[06:15:57] <Cork> and that isn't valid
[06:17:02] <nFFFF> yes figured it out now
[06:17:05] <nFFFF> thanks
[06:18:37] <HelperW> No one a suggestion for my Select options?
[06:20:44] <krambiorix> how can i select an input text field by value?
[06:20:52] <Cork> krambiorix: you can't
[06:21:08] <Cork> well you can filter by value but that's about it
[06:21:27] <Cork> $('input').filter(function() { return this.value === 'match'; })
[06:21:47] <Cork> krambiorix: the reason you can't select on it is that the current value isn't exposed to css
[06:22:06] <Cork> you can select based on the original value, but that is all
[06:23:10] <krambiorix> Cork,  ow, so i'll have to loop then
[06:23:14] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[06:23:51] <Cork> krambiorix: ya, as filter is basically just a loop
[06:25:08] <krambiorix> Cork, k
[06:29:50] <krambiorix> i have an input field with a datepicker on it... How can i track when the field value changes?
[06:30:51] <Cork> krambiorix: i think the plugin fires the change event
[06:31:49] <krambiorix> Cork, but not on the field
[06:36:46] <interop_madness> given a parent element with display:none, i need to calculate the height of a child element i add to the parent within the time window in which the parent is still display:none. any way to do that?
[06:37:08] <krambiorix> Cork, forget about it, there was another event bound to the field :D
[06:37:10] <interop_madness> i.e. i get height() === 0 because the parent is not yet visible, but i already need the height for later
[06:43:57] <Cork> interop_madness: you can't calculate the dimentions of elements under a parent with display: none
[06:44:11] <Cork> interop_madness: it's a speed optimization in the browsers
[06:44:22] <Cork> they doesn't reflow content under display: none
[06:44:38] <Cork> so they don't have any dimensions
[06:44:56] <interop_madness> ok, so i'll go and temporarily set it display:block, move it out of he browser viewport (it's absolutely positioned), calculate and revert my temp. css changes?
[06:45:19] <Cork> interop_madness: you have two options
[06:45:27] <SuperTyp> Hello guys
[06:45:37] <Cork> just set display: block; grab the dimension and set display: none again
[06:45:50] <Cork> interop_madness: as long as you don't do it async it shoulnd't be visible
[06:46:04] <Cork> or you could set visibility: collapse on the parent instead of display: none
[06:46:41] <SuperTyp> I want to create a website without loading other html sites, that means only one hmtl, that contents different containers that gets slided in on click. Do you guys have a suggestion of how I could reach that goal in the best way?
[06:47:14] <BillCriswell> SuperTyp: tabs?
[06:47:35] <SuperTyp> BillCriswell: more specifiy please?
[06:48:32] <BillCriswell> https://jqueryui.com/tabs/ like this, minus the tabbed styles.
[06:49:00] <BillCriswell> SuperTyp: It could essentially also work just like a slideshow where the "pagination" is different pages.
[06:49:18] <SuperTyp> yeah something like that but the content shell be slided in
[06:49:51] <OnkelTem> Hi all. I use jQuery 1.8. I post data to a server with $.ajax('...', data: { param: value }). The problem is that value is javascript BOOLEAN value - true or false. But on server side I get it as string. How can make it boolean?
[06:49:53] <interop_madness> Cork, first suggestion already seemed to work. would you reccomment the first or the second one?
[06:50:05] <BillCriswell> SuperTyp: http://unslider.com/ You could essetnially have your content as a giant one of these sliders.
[06:50:14] <SuperTyp> the problem is I want content that does not slide out, that just stays while other content gets slided in
[06:50:14] <interop_madness> first one in my case has the advantage that i don't need to set/revert as many css properties
[06:50:35] <Cork> interop_madness: those where to separate options, and both should work
[06:50:46] <Cork> interop_madness: well the first one trigger a reflow as you change display
[06:50:55] <BillCriswell> SuperTyp: So it would be like stacked offscreen?
[06:51:03] <BillCriswell> Or you just always want the next to be on top?
[06:51:06] <Cork> interop_madness: but the second doesn't optimize away the rendering of the children
[06:51:16] <Cork> so when it isn't visible you still pay the price for them
[06:51:26] <Cork> interop_madness: so ya, i would go with the first one
[06:51:37] <interop_madness> ok thank you Cork
[06:51:43] <Cork> np
[06:51:49] <BillCriswell> SuperTyp: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/browser.html if you click the "uncover" effect here basically?
[06:53:10] <SuperTyp> hm no :D
[06:53:31] <SuperTyp> e.g. I have a logo on top of screen then a nav bar vertically
[06:53:59] <SuperTyp> when I click on a "link" of the nav bar the logo and the nav bar stay but the content below it slides out and the new content slides in
[06:54:15] <SuperTyp> sorry nav bar is ofc horizontally
[06:54:59] <BillCriswell> SuperTyp: It sounds like you'd just want the unslider link I sent you as the content area.
[06:55:20] <BillCriswell> Fuck I forgot deodorant this morning, brb CVS.
[06:56:16] <SuperTyp> yes BillCriswell is that an efficent way to do it?
[06:58:16] <xKraty> SuperTyp: something like that? http://xkraty.github.io/xMovie/
[06:58:35] <xKraty> ( use arrows for move )
[06:59:21] <SuperTyp> kind of yes, but the only static thing is the background there
[06:59:42] <xKraty> you can easily add a fixed navbar
[06:59:45] <SuperTyp> what is the best way to show you what I did for now?
[07:00:18] <xKraty> a public link to your dev app
[07:00:33] <SuperTyp> dev app?
[07:00:34] <xKraty> or if you can rebuild it in jsfiddle
[07:00:43] <xKraty> you working on local?
[07:00:50] <xKraty> or you got an ip where we can see it
[07:02:58] <SuperTyp> local
[07:03:08] <SuperTyp> I try jsfiddle
[07:03:10] <xKraty> ok
[07:03:43] <BillCriswell> Ahh, much better.
[07:06:05] <xKraty> wut? BillCriswell
[07:07:44] <BillCriswell> Got some deodorant.
[07:08:02] * xKraty ROFL
[07:09:31] <BillCriswell> I was looking around like "Who stinks like that?" then realized it was me.
[07:09:57] * xKraty gives some water and shampoo
[07:10:24] <ankurk_> Why not a perfume? :P
[07:11:48] <xKraty> oh noes ankurk_
[07:11:57] <ankurk_> *evil laugh*
[07:12:13] * xKraty become a stone again
[07:12:27] <BillCriswell> Can't say I'm a fan of the travel size speed stick I just got.
[07:18:58] <xKraty> stupid network
[07:23:02] <SuperTyp> lmao BillCriswell
[07:24:19] <Kingsy> can someone recommend a good markup carousel? that is responsive?
[07:24:36] <Kingsy> I was using owl carousel, which is nice, but there are some problems with it
[07:24:47] <Kingsy> for example you cant have an infinte loop it needs to rewind.
[07:25:06] <Kingsy> you also cant have margins on either wide of the slider and also have it responsive
[07:36:30] <SuperTyp> well I am trying to jsfiddle it but it doesnt work
[07:37:46] <jim87> is there a short way, in JS or jQuery, to assign a variable to a value and, if it's undefined, a fallback? Something like var x = $myvar OR $myfallback IF NULL
[07:37:48] <SuperTyp> well give me a sec I will make my stuff available online
[07:37:48] <jim87> undefined*
[07:38:17] <BillCriswell> jim87: var x = foo || bar
[07:38:27] <jim87> BillCriswell thanks :)
[07:39:10] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:40:17] <SuperTyp> here you go guys
[07:40:18] <SuperTyp> https://ssl-account.com/vfrbb.de/test/start.html
[07:40:23] <SuperTyp> this is what I created so far
[07:40:33] <SuperTyp> please notice its not finsihed and there are some bugs in
[07:40:39] <SuperTyp> when you click on enter
[07:40:43] <SuperTyp> and then on the logo
[07:40:47] <SuperTyp> you see what I want
[07:41:10] <xKraty>  +1 for bb images lol
[07:41:16] <SuperTyp> :D
[07:41:36] <SuperTyp> if you click on the links of the navigation bar you notice a bug, when you go back to the previous one
[07:41:43] <xKraty> isnt your navbar too big?
[07:42:42] <SuperTyp> what you mean?
[07:42:45] <xKraty> for me it's not working at all
[07:42:57] <SuperTyp> what browser?
[07:43:03] <xKraty> 270px is huge
[07:43:14] <xKraty> im on chrome latest on maverick
[07:43:27] <xKraty> only the enter works
[07:43:59] <SuperTyp> sorry I forgot I commented stuff out
[07:44:01] <SuperTyp> try it now
[07:45:38] <m4rtijn> hi
[07:45:57] <xKraty> it's totally messed up
[07:46:31] <m4rtijn> id like to send a form via ajax to a script  without json encoding the data, like as if the data is send normally without ajax.. how would I do that?
[07:47:02] <jphase> m4rtijn: use .serialize()
[07:48:07] <m4rtijn> jphase: what should I use in the dataType att?
[07:48:23] <jphase> you don't even need to set it really
[07:48:37] <m4rtijn> ok, thanks jphase
[07:48:42] <jphase> np
[07:49:01] <SuperTyp> xKraty: yes thats the problem
[07:49:05] <SuperTyp> if you look on the code
[07:49:11] <SuperTyp> its the whole time same shit
[07:49:19] <SuperTyp> remove class and add class thats all
[07:49:31] <SuperTyp> but anyhow I dont really know why and how that happens
[07:49:56] <xKraty> dataType is the expected format from server response m4rtijn
[07:50:01] <SuperTyp> the containers get a inline style asigned
[07:51:18] <SuperTyp> xKraty: I just checked it on chrome on my 24" it looks like on my surface pro in FF
[07:51:32] <SuperTyp> what do you mean by my nav bar is too big? You may send me  a screenshot?
[07:51:38] <xKraty> i has 13"
[07:51:49] <xKraty> it taking most of the screen
[07:51:49] <SuperTyp> have*
[07:52:01] <SuperTyp> I have 10" surface pro
[07:54:33] <fatguylaughing> Is there a way to not reuse the class selector for the element containing the class of "blue" inside the if. It's redundant. http://jsfiddle.net/nyLG5/
[07:56:15] <xKraty> fatguylaughing: http://jsfiddle.net/xKraty/nyLG5/1/
[07:56:36] <fatguylaughing> xKraty: Thanks a lot
[07:56:40] * fatguylaughing facepalm
[07:56:41] <xKraty> fatguylaughing: http://jsfiddle.net/xKraty/nyLG5/2/ with border
[07:57:09] <xKraty> SuperTyp: still i feel like it taking too much space for me, just personal though
[07:57:36] <SuperTyp> ok strange
[07:58:32] <SuperTyp> xKraty: for me there is like 7-8 cm space from the left and right border until the navbar comes
[07:58:34] <xKraty> SuperTyp: never used jquery ui for such thing, i'd make a srollable div and move it
[07:59:04] <SuperTyp> scrollable like parallax scrolling?
[08:00:44] <xKraty> like sliders
[08:00:56] <xKraty> a long div with inside your sections
[08:01:06] <xKraty> and move it for show what you need
[08:01:13] <xKraty> like i showed you before
[08:01:16] <SuperTyp> ok
[08:02:25] <xKraty> you can try my plugin if you wish https://github.com/xkraty/xmovie
[08:02:54] <xKraty> it was my first one, and last to be honest, don't remember if it was finished or still much bugged
[08:16:56] <SuperTyp> thx maybe I will use it
[08:22:22] <BillCriswell> It takes my old coworkers sass like 30 seconds to compile.
[08:22:59] <pu239> i have an empty div that i clone, and insert before itself, then i replaceWIth some data from an ajax request
[08:23:26] <pu239> that works, but i need to update a value and i can't seem to get it to find the value
[08:24:39] <pu239> i should set up a fiddle
[08:24:41] <BillCriswell> pu239: Have some code somewhere to look at?
[08:25:56] <BillCriswell> pu239: I concur!
[08:26:10] <pu239> BillCriswell: working on it now, appreciate it
[08:30:07] <Fishy> how can i select the td two columns behind my current selected td
[08:30:59] <BillCriswell> Fishy: .prev().prev() could work.
[08:31:16] <Fishy> BillCriswell: thanks let me try
[08:31:41] <pu239> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/xFM5m/, that's an overly simple example, but i think it illustrates my problem
[08:31:43] <Fishy> if i knew the the column number would that help?
[08:31:48] <pu239> i'm guessing it's something very simple
[08:32:02] <pu239> but i'm still kind of new to this
[08:32:19] <BillCriswell> Fishy: It could if you wanted to grab the td by the index.
[08:33:25] <Fishy> BillCriswell: how so... so if im inside the one td with $(this) . how can i get back outside to another td by index?
[08:34:13] <BillCriswell> Fishy: You could do .closest('tr').find('td').eq(someIndex)
[08:34:48] <amool> hey guys.. can anyone look into this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22185793/is-jquery-interpreting-it-wrong-or-drupal-outputting-wrong
[08:37:02] <BillCriswell> pu239: You are basically just working with a one time data. You would need to do like this: http://jsfiddle.net/xFM5m/1/
[08:37:54] <BillCriswell> pu239: So when you do var html = '<b>Hello <span>World</span></b>'; $(html).find('span').text('Bill'); $('body').append(html); you never atually altered the span.
[08:38:31] <BillCriswell> I did this instead: var $html = $('<b>Hello <span>World</span></b>'); $html.find('span').text('Bill'); $('body').append($html);
[08:38:44] <pu239> DOH!
[08:38:50] <Fishy> BillCriswell: having issues getting that working.. still looking at it
[08:38:58] <pu239> BillCriswell: thanks a lot, really appreciate it
[08:39:05] <BillCriswell> pu239: No problem at all.
[08:46:12] <BillCriswell> Fishy: http://jsbin.com/melifiki/2/edit
[08:48:14] <ddssc> is it possible to have one for on 2 jq ui tabs?
[08:48:18] <ddssc> one form
[08:48:28] <ddssc> 1 form = 2 tabs
[08:48:33] <ddssc> possibru?
[08:48:41] <BillCriswell> Fishy: $(this).prevAll().eq(1).addClass('back2'); could also work.
[08:48:47] <BillCriswell> I was just trying to be verbose with it.
[08:49:10] <BillCriswell> Fishy: http://jsbin.com/melifiki/3/edit
[08:49:31] <Fishy> BillCriswell: thank you.. looking at it
[08:50:52] <decx> eq with negative value loops? :o
[08:51:13] <decx> GOOD LORD
[08:51:52] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha yes.
[08:52:37] <BillCriswell> To avoid it you could use [] over .eq().
[08:55:27] <decx> damn, it's beautiful, goodbye archaic test if it's first or last
[08:56:04] <bberry> hey all, im using the iframe 'hack' to stop the page reloading on a form submit.  On the form submit, i save an identifier serverside, and then on the iframes load event i check to see if the identifier is the same.  However, it seems like the load event is happening more than just once, and sometimes returns old data. heres the relevant code http:
[08:56:04] <bberry> //jsfiddle.net/4Bzqx/
[08:58:16] <DarkSector_> Is there a way to not disable a select field and yet have it not changeable? Like if you click on it, it won't change
[08:58:33] <DarkSector_> Because I've noticed if you disable a field, the value doesn't get passed to the server
[08:59:07] <DarkSector_> So, I want the UI to be like disabled but a value is selected and passed when a request is sent
[08:59:38] <BillCriswell> DarkSector_: You can try a readonly attribute
[08:59:46] <BillCriswell> Not sure if I used that on a select before.
[09:00:12] <DarkSector_> BillCriswell: is there a read only attribute?
[09:00:16] <DarkSector_> I've never seen that before
[09:01:10] <DarkSector_> Oh this is a good option https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11976348/a-readonly-equivalent-for-html-select-elements
[09:01:15] <DarkSector_> disable rest of the values
[09:01:32] <BillCriswell> DarkSector_: Ah.
[09:01:35] <paulvd> i am trying to display the height of a div in console, using jQuerytotalheight = jQuery("#slider-wrap").height(); console.log(jQuerytotalheight); but its displaying 0 ?
[09:01:58] <BillCriswell> Stinks the readonly won't work on a select, it does work on inputs though should that come up.
[09:02:57] <BillCriswell> paulvd: Is there an image in there?
[09:04:16] <paulvd> BillCriswell: yes images and lot of things
[09:04:25] <paulvd> BillCriswell: I am using window.load also
[09:04:56] <duch_kazatel> good morning #jquery
[09:05:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ayyyyyyy
[09:05:16] <BillCriswell> paulvd: Hmmm..
[09:05:54] <BillCriswell> paulvd: What if you put overflow:hidden; on #slider-wrap? I imagine things inside it are floated.
[09:07:09] <paulvd> BillCriswell: not really floated, but let me try
[09:08:48] <paulvd> still 0
[09:09:00] <decx> is that from a script?
[09:09:15] <decx> if there's a slider-wrap there might be an absolutely positioned slider-viewport
[09:10:47] <BillCriswell> paulvd: If you put a background color on #slider-wrap do you see it?
[09:10:56] <paulvd> it has a big image now
[09:11:20] <BillCriswell> I don't know then. Can't help anymore without seeing it.
[09:11:56] <paulvd> yeah putting it online
[09:13:26] <paulvd> It has a slider within in
[09:13:42] <BillCriswell> If you inspect the element does it have a height?
[09:14:26] <paulvd> yes it does
[09:16:47] <ankurk_> Well, I have a question, we are currently making an ajax call to get all records from the database but it is slow. Is there any way we can make those records loads faster?
[09:17:04] <snover> get a faster database
[09:17:11] <duch_kazatel> optimize your queries.
[09:17:15] <duch_kazatel> optimize your page caching.
[09:17:21] <BillCriswell> don't get all the recoards
[09:17:27] <duch_kazatel> use memcached or something else.
[09:17:40] <BillCriswell> page the recoards
[09:17:40] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ how many records are you returning?
[09:17:43] <ankurk_> well, we have to get all records since we have a section called all records
[09:17:58] <duch_kazatel> then people have to accept that page will be slow.
[09:18:04] <duch_kazatel> or you need an intermediary with caching in it.
[09:18:08] <ryanneufeld> ankurk_: you could load them in batches
[09:18:19] <ryanneufeld> you don't need to load everything, look at infinite scrolling
[09:18:23] <ryanneufeld> or pagination
[09:18:32] <decx> seo people tried to convince me to build a view all page for product categories, the server actually cried out in agony
[09:18:33] <ryanneufeld> or live with it being slow
[09:18:45] <duch_kazatel> i'd avoid infinite scrolling in this case, but pagination is smart.
[09:18:48] <ankurk_> it
[09:19:01] <ankurk_> they are around 600 records
[09:19:04] <duch_kazatel> decx your seo people are morons.  use a sitemap and call it a day.
[09:19:18] <decx> there already was one :D
[09:19:26] <decx> i added rel next/prev meta links
[09:19:27] <decx> ;)
[09:19:34] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ that shouldn't be a big load.
[09:19:38] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ how many columns?
[09:19:50] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Does you need ALL the fields you're retrieving? 600 records shouldn't really be too slow if there's not a lot of data in each.
[09:20:24] <ankurk_> it's actually a bunch of tables we get the records from
[09:20:53] <ankurk_> I know 600 records shouldn't be a big, but since everyone in the company uses it
[09:20:59] <ankurk_> it's an internal system
[09:21:12] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ are your queries joining data at the database, or are you doing that logic in your server-side?
[09:21:14] <duch_kazatel> or client side?
[09:22:18] <ankurk_> It's on the server side
[09:22:44] <duch_kazatel> so you're hitting a DB, returning data, then hitting another db and combining those outside of the DB?
[09:22:47] <duch_kazatel> because that's your problem.
[09:22:49] <ankurk_> we thought of using sockets, but it will put a huge load on server if every one is connected
[09:23:27] <ankurk_> well, looks there's a problem hmm
[09:23:39] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with joins?
[09:23:49] <luvmyh0nda-[idle> is now away: [reason: Idle after 10h][pager: yes][]
[09:24:02] <ankurk_> actually wait, it's just the one table
[09:24:31] <ankurk_> my bad, moreover we have a search bar too and we want to save the search state when user goes away, anything for that?
[09:24:48] <duch_kazatel> you need some good old caching.
[09:24:53] <duch_kazatel> and session management.
[09:26:26] <duch_kazatel> what database are you using?
[09:26:34] <graphettion> Can anyone help me out with this menu? I'm trying to get it to slide up and down but not sure where to put the method I guess. - http://jsfiddle.net/kYgBf/1/
[09:27:03] <ankurk_> We are using MS SQL
[09:27:38] <xmath279> Is this possible to make a page as a "dialog" without having to press a link to open it?
[09:27:42] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ that's very odd, then.  mssql does a lot of query optimization for you.  interesting.
[09:28:03] <ankurk_> seriously? It might be because of improper configuration
[09:28:18] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ can you query the database correctly?
[09:28:21] <duch_kazatel> *directly
[09:28:36] <ankurk_> yep I can
[09:28:38] <ryanneufeld> ankurk_: it could be that you don't have an indexes on your tables
[09:28:43] <duch_kazatel> if so, try to run your query in sql server management studio and look at how long it takes.
[09:28:56] <duch_kazatel> yeah if you don't have indexing, that'll be part of it.
[09:29:08] <duch_kazatel> xmath279 define "dialog"
[09:29:12] <duch_kazatel> you mean a modal?
[09:29:15] <duch_kazatel> or a popup?
[09:29:18] <xmath279> jQuery Mobile data-role="dialog"
[09:29:29] <duch_kazatel> i don't see why not.
[09:31:19] <ankurk_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/A5ECUuGG
[09:31:32] <ankurk_> It gives me this
[09:31:36] <xmath279> Do you have an idea on how I can do it? Because I've made a page  that has a div role="dialog" in it but the dialog does not get opened on $(document).ready
[09:32:18] <mikeybisbo> Is there anyway to pause and resume a background colour transition set with `transition: color 6s`? `animation-play-state: paused` is not working!
[09:32:19] <duch_kazatel> xmath279 you'll need to trigger it via a .click() or something similar i'm guessing.
[09:32:57] <Shilon> hi there, anyone uses masonry? I'm having a problem with it. I'm making 4 columns div with 25%, I added gutter 0 and for no reason its making a gutter between divs and it creates an horizontal scroll
[09:33:59] <duch_kazatel> wait ankurk_ you're not leaving statistics on are you?
[09:34:56] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ either way, i'm hitting a devevlopment db and getting CPU time = 16 ms,  elapsed time = 78 ms.
[09:35:05] <duch_kazatel> and that's with 1000 rows
[09:36:11] <duch_kazatel> and our DBs are not at all optimized.
[09:38:09] <ankurk_> I did do this, SET STATISTICS TIME ON
[09:38:17] <nyuszika7h> hi, can anyone help me? pushState works from index, but not from page 2: http://nyuszika7h.cadoth.net/experiments/pushstate/index.html
[09:38:18] <duch_kazatel> you turned them off after, right?
[09:38:41] <duch_kazatel> nyuszika7h "but not from page 2:" meaning...?
[09:38:58] <ankurk_> It's turned off right now
[09:39:00] <nyuszika7h> if I click "previous" in page 2, it goes normally to index, not via pushState+AJAX
[09:39:08] <duch_kazatel> it's doing it for me.
[09:39:11] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you in?
[09:39:13] <nyuszika7h> umm, I blame Firefox then
[09:39:16] <nyuszika7h> FF Aurora
[09:39:20] <duch_kazatel> ff is fine for me.
[09:39:26] <nyuszika7h> 29.0a2
[09:39:40] <duch_kazatel> 27.0.1
[09:39:44] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[09:39:55] <duch_kazatel> ff is actually compliant with the pushstate spec, too.
[09:40:19] <nyuszika7h> I would say caching but I highly doubt it, as I've already pushed numerous new versions of page2.html and Firefox is reflecting the changes, not giving me a cached versions
[09:40:22] <decx> your a click binder doesnt apply anymore when you reload your main
[09:40:23] <nyuszika7h> changes to the .js were reflected too
[09:40:41] <duch_kazatel> decx has it.
[09:40:44] <duch_kazatel> change your binding.
[09:40:44] <nyuszika7h> decx: hmm, interesting, how would I solve that?
[09:40:51] <nyuszika7h> by rebinding it?
[09:41:02] <duch_kazatel> event delegation.
[09:41:10] <decx> $('#main').on('click','a',fn)
[09:41:14] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[09:41:18] <duch_kazatel> he beat me to it :D
[09:41:24] <graphettion> Can anyone help me out with this menu? I'm trying to get it to slide up and down but not sure where to put the method I guess. - http://jsfiddle.net/kYgBf/1/
[09:41:26] <decx> maybe have a class on there
[09:41:32] <decx> instead of juts a
[09:41:59] <duch_kazatel> graphettion it'd be in the hover before the CSS.
[09:42:32] <duch_kazatel> *css method call.  in fact, i'd take that out or put it in the success callback of the animation.
[09:42:40] <graphettion> Like this? - http://jsfiddle.net/kYgBf/2/
[09:42:51] <duch_kazatel> no.
[09:42:56] <duch_kazatel> in the over method calls.
[09:42:57] <marpstar> can anyone tell me right off the bat if jQuery 2.0 and jQuery UI 1.8 are incompatible or not?
[09:43:15] <graphettion> Hrm, k
[09:43:34] <Shilon> anyone uses masonry?!
[09:43:35] <duch_kazatel> also you're targeting the LIs inside of that UL.
[09:43:46] <duch_kazatel> Shilon i used it once, but I cant answer your question.
[09:44:04] <jphase> marpstar: always a bad idea to use a moldy version of one thing and a beta version of another
[09:44:10] <Shilon> duch_kazatel: ok, thanks mate
[09:44:27] <Shilon> duch_kazatel: you used masonry v3?
[09:44:35] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:44:48] <duch_kazatel> actually, I can't remember.
[09:44:53] <marpstar> jphase: what do you mean beta? neither are beta...
[09:45:46] <jphase> well the stable release of jquery that's recommended is 1.9.x
[09:45:57] <jphase> and jquery ui has a few major revisions past 1.8
[09:46:26] <paulvd> here is the url of the height() issue
[09:46:26] <paulvd> http://gajet.cardinalwebsolutions.net/fleet/hawker-800a/
[09:46:30] <marpstar> jphase: jQuery 2 is not beta, though. it's intended for use if you don't need IE 6-8 compatibility
[09:46:35] <marpstar> which I don't
[09:46:37] <jphase> since jQuery 2.x.x doesn't support IE8 yeah
[09:46:46] <jphase> and that doesn't EOL until next month
[09:46:49] <marpstar> yeah, I only need IE10 and up
[09:46:52] <duch_kazatel> graphettion you want to remove your css :hover handling, as well.
[09:47:12] <jphase> well, just update jquery ui - is there a reason why you want to use 1.8.x ?
[09:47:31] <jphase> I mean, in theory it should work - didn't mean to dodge your question
[09:47:35] <marpstar> I've got a client with an app running jQuery 1.5.1 and UI 1.8.14. They've added a bunch of custom code to UI 1.8.14, so I'm trying to mitigate having to fix that.
[09:47:55] <jphase> I just usually don't use bleeding edge (production or not) with an old version of something else requiring said latest version
[09:47:59] <jphase> oic
[09:48:04] <paulvd> I am trying to get height of a div using .height() but it displays 0 in console
[09:48:04] <marpstar> yeah, the situation sucks...hard.
[09:48:28] <jphase> marpstar: I honestly don't see a problem with it running on 2.x - try it locally, I doubt it will break
[09:48:43] <marpstar> jphase: I'll give it a shot. Thanks!
[09:49:32] <graphettion> duch_kazatel: Yeah, looks like I have to take another approach. :/ Thanks.
[09:49:52] <duch_kazatel> graphettion i'd start from the beginning if I were you :)
[09:49:53] <paulvd> I am trying to get height of a div using .height() but it displays 0 in console
[09:50:05] <duch_kazatel> paulvd is the div hidden?
[09:50:06] <graphettion> duch_kazatel: Great minds think alike.
[09:50:44] <paulvd> duch_kazatel: no of course not
[09:51:10] <duch_kazatel> then it's impossible to know.  mind sharing in a fiddle?
[09:51:41] <paulvd> http://tinyurl.com/q4mjbes
[09:51:44] <paulvd> here's the url
[09:51:53] <duch_kazatel> which div is it?
[09:51:56] <paulvd> the div is the one which holds the slider
[09:52:02] <paulvd> #slider-wrap
[09:52:41] <duch_kazatel> the positioning is causing it to collapse on pageload.
[09:52:43] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[09:53:08] <decx> your flexslider isnt initialized
[09:53:09] <duch_kazatel> wait are you running that check before or after the slider init?
[09:53:10] <paulvd> the position: relative you mean?
[09:53:19] <decx> flexslider hides the li by default
[09:53:20] <paulvd> hmm
[09:53:26] <decx> in its css
[09:53:47] <decx> but you never get to the part where it's initalized and doesnt apply that style anymore
[09:54:03] <decx> nevermind
[09:54:06] <decx> i got noscript
[09:54:07] <decx> lol
[09:54:08] <decx> :D
[09:54:09] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[09:54:46] <decx> but if you do your console logging the height before flexslider is initialized it's 0 ;)
[09:55:28] <paulvd> yes i am checking how to load that after slider has loaded
[09:55:45] <decx> there are several functions
[09:56:20] <decx> start: on init before: before a slide, after: after one, end: when you hit your last slide
[09:56:23] <decx> and some others
[09:57:27] <paulvd> end i think..
[09:57:29] <paulvd> or start
[09:57:34] <paulvd> either one will work i think
[09:58:12] <decx> i forgot added, when you add a slide and removed
[09:59:04] <paulvd> start: worked
[09:59:11] <paulvd> thank you
[09:59:18] <decx> i love flexslider ^^
[09:59:35] <paulvd> yep its nice i was using bxslider before
[09:59:39] <paulvd> till i came across flex
[10:00:15] <synth_> hello, was just curious if it's possible to run an ajax get on a html document and only retrieve specific portions of it's html instead of the entire document?
[10:00:39] <decx> simplest way is load('myhtml.html #fragment')
[10:00:53] <decx> it's a bit more involved if you use ajax()
[10:01:09] <synth_> okay, that's good to know. thank you!
[10:01:59] <decx> with ajax() you have to find() or filter() the element in the data that success gives you
[10:02:57] <synth_> yeah, i think i might have to do that anyway, i'm trying to filter through a fcgi SmokePing document to grab out all of the graphs and navigation links
[10:29:17] <duch_kazatel> browser detection will be the death of me.
[10:30:08] <paulvd> hello, i am trying to set padding using a jquery value, $("#fleet-title").css("padding", $padding + "0"); $padding has the right value, however it shows as padding: value, when i want it as padding: value 0
[10:30:54] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Eeeeeevil.
[10:31:18] <BillCriswell> paulvd: " 0"
[10:31:25] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell right?! same with .toggle()
[10:32:35] <paulvd> ?
[10:33:02] <BillCriswell> Space 0
[10:34:27] <BillCriswell> paulvd: http://jsbin.com/kelaseze/2/edit
[10:34:52] <BillCriswell> Why are using $padding instead of padding?
[10:38:46] <nyuszika7h> http://nyuszika7h.cadoth.net/experiments/pushstate/index.html - how do I prevent this from loading the new page before the fade-out is complete?
[10:39:09] <nyuszika7h> oh, with a callback on fadeOut
[10:42:40] <nyuszika7h> ugh, now pushState broke
[10:43:45] <duch_kazatel> what's broken?
[10:45:25] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[10:46:49] <duch_kazatel> aaah, so you need to explicitly set the url to what you want it to be. the href attribute is a relative URL, so it's going to reload the whole page.
[10:46:49] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:49:25] <duch_kazatel> back
[10:52:48] <BillCriswell> Trailer Park Boys Season 8 and 9 on Netflix at the end of March. DEEEEECENT.
[10:53:55] <bigLanky_> http://jsfiddle.net/fLKnJ/ <--- I have a button that I am just trying to auto-submit
[10:54:27] <BillCriswell> bigLanky: You don't submit the button, you submit the form by pressing its button.
[10:55:10] <BillCriswell> bigLanky: There's nothing to submit to in this example.
[10:55:28] <BillCriswell> Your code should work just fine but you probably want to do $('form').trigger('submit') instead.
[10:55:29] <bigLanky> i need to click the button for #get-results-button
[10:55:40] <bigLanky> i didnt code this
[10:55:45] <bigLanky> i am just trying to make it auto-submit
[10:55:46] <BillCriswell> Right, and you're doing it right, but there's no form.
[10:56:00] <bigLanky> it works when you click it manually, i am just tyring to auto-click it
[10:56:18] <BillCriswell> bigLanky: Is it in a form?
[10:56:26] <bigLanky> no
[10:56:29] <bigLanky> the code you see there is it
[10:56:40] <BillCriswell> Then there's nothing to submit.
[10:56:50] <bigLanky> why does it work when i manually click it then
[10:56:56] <bigLanky> its using JS to listen for the click
[10:58:41] <BillCriswell> bigLanky: Your code is clicking the button.
[10:59:12] <BillCriswell> bigLanky: http://jsfiddle.net/fLKnJ/2/ look at the console.
[11:01:08] <walidvb> For those who gave me a hand during this project(and that's many of you), here it is, finally online! http://lezoo.ch/ thanks to all!
[11:04:00] <BillCriswell> walidvb: Sweeet.
[11:04:10] <walidvb> thx BillCriswell
[11:04:16] <walidvb> i'll be back for more, don't worry ;)
[11:04:51] <walidvb> even though css wise, i let my brother do this one. (meaning debugging was a pita, but i wasn't always the one fighting with CSS)
[11:06:27] <decx> walidvb put your modernizr in the head, it works best that way
[11:06:59] <walidvb> decx: why so?
[11:07:26] <decx> that way you can do css stuff depending on classes that modernizr adds before the whole document is loaded and prevent the style flash that sometimes occurs
[11:08:16] <decx> i don't notice it on your page, but if html5 boilerplate does it, it can't be that bad ;)
[11:11:19] <walidvb> decx: makes sense.
[11:11:29] <walidvb> tbh, i don't even use modernizr so much here
[11:13:34] <decx> i'm guilty of that as well.. "eh... putting a modernizr on there won't hurt"
[11:13:45] <decx> "i'm already putting the ie shiv so whatever"
[11:19:28] <nannes> guys
[11:19:58] <nannes> There is a page done with bootstrap and jquery... how can i download its sources and modify it?
[11:20:29] <synth_> is there something wrong with this syntax? it logs the entire document's html instead of the #overview selector: $("#test").load("cgi-bin/smokeping.fcgi?target=network #overview", function (data) {console.log(data);});
[11:20:30] <BillCriswell> nannes: The examples you get when you download bootstrap should have all that in there.
[11:20:58] <walidvb> decx: lo
[11:20:58] <ankurk_> you what's bad? copying code manually to the live server :(
[11:21:00] <nannes> nono, there is a page done with someone else... and i need to download THAT one... with its sources
[11:21:09] <walidvb> i basically only use it for no-toch ....
[11:21:17] <BillCriswell> synth_: You sure #overview exists?
[11:22:14] <synth_> BillCriswell; yes, here's a snippet of the code returned in the console: <P id="overview"><div><A HREF="?target=network.nox1"><IMG BORD.... however, it's also including the <html><body> blah blah blah
[11:23:03] <BillCriswell> nannes: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538865/how-do-you-archive-an-entire-website-for-offline-viewing might help.
[11:23:45] <nannes> it's a single page, not an entire website
[11:23:51] <decx> synth_ that's standard behaviour
[11:24:02] <nannes> if i just do  "save as" with the browser, does it work?
[11:24:04] <decx> the data in the callback is still like it's in ajax()
[11:24:12] <BillCriswell> nannes: A website can be just a single page.
[11:24:22] <decx> the fragment magic from load is done directly
[11:24:33] <nannes> yes, but usually it's not.
[11:24:44] <BillCriswell> nannes: You could just try File > Save
[11:24:57] <synth_> decx, even when doing $("#test").load( ... ) my <div id="test"> does not receive anything
[11:25:23] <decx> synth_ http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3q8Sx/
[11:25:24] <BillCriswell> nannes: File > Save Page As...
[11:25:44] <synth_> oh wait, yes it is. however, it's receiving an empty <p id="overview"></p>
[11:27:15] <synth_> sigh
[11:28:22] <synth_> could it be that i'm loading a fcgi script's data, and that the html hasn't had a chance to generate by the time load() runs?
[11:31:28] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[11:31:43] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with martItUp?
[11:39:18] <decx> i'm not convinced after visiting their website, but it can't be worse than fck
[12:21:14] <nyuszika7h> nvm, solved it
[12:21:24] <nyuszika7h> had to put the 'return false' outside of the fadeOut callback
[12:21:27] <nyuszika7h> the page was loading before the animation had a chance to trigger
[12:37:35] <duch_kazatel> i.imgur.com/e2mHIKQ.png
[12:41:06] <decx> SYNERGIE$ bitch
[12:42:58] <Velveeta> what's wrong with mongo?
[12:42:58] <duch_kazatel> :D
[12:44:54] <duch_kazatel> it's just being funny
[12:47:14] <BillCriswell> I wish I could focus on work.
[12:48:54] <BillCriswell> I think it would be easier if this Sass didn't take 10 seconds to build
[12:49:20] <duch_kazatel> ew.
[12:49:23] <duch_kazatel> you have that problem too?
[12:49:54] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Just for this project in particular. Too many little plugins and things like that loading I think.
[12:50:41] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[12:50:58] <decx> finally time to have sword fight on a chair
[12:51:13] <duch_kazatel> haha glad i'm not the only one who remembers that xkcd
[12:51:23] <BillCriswell> It's compiling!
[12:51:31] <decx> it only gets referenced once every 3 seconds
[12:51:33] <decx> ;)
[12:51:48] <duch_kazatel> not at my company.
[12:51:51] <BillCriswell> I'm living it every 3 seconds.
[12:53:30] <BillCriswell> Ah, this thing is importing Neat and Singularity.
[12:53:37] <BillCriswell> Should have looked at this file sooner lol
[12:53:44] <duch_kazatel> oh jesus
[12:55:07] <duch_kazatel> aaaah i hate everyone.
[12:55:14] <duch_kazatel> .toggle was awful
[12:55:22] <BillCriswell> That shaved like 1 second off. Sweet.
[12:55:29] <Jattenalle> dont be like that duch_kazatel :'(
[12:55:32] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha. You are really hating that today.
[12:55:42] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[12:55:51] <duch_kazatel> what really kills me is that was added to this file late last year.
[12:55:57] <duch_kazatel> like... nobody was paying attention.
[12:55:58] <Jattenalle> yeah i dont use it, i use .show()/.hide()
[12:56:24] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: What issue are you running into with it?
[12:56:38] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle you're mistaken about which version of toggle was being used ;)
[12:57:03] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, oh
[12:57:05] <duch_kazatel> there's the show/hide one, and there's another method signature for alternatively running 2 functions.
[12:57:34] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, that just sounds really messy :P
[12:57:47] <duch_kazatel> they deprecated the second one (thank god) but it's in a core file that's used all over the place.  only frustrating because it's so recently done and the dev should've known better.
[12:58:24] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell they were just using it in some really funky ways.
[13:04:32] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Sucks.
[13:04:52] <duch_kazatel> meh.  i'd still rather be doing this than a lot of other things.
[13:05:18] <Jattenalle> wait, are you talking about the jquery core? or just a project that's using it? duch_kazatel?
[13:06:25] <BillCriswell> This project has like... every plugin for Sass imaginable and is using none of them.
[13:08:29] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle just this project.
[13:08:48] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle we're on jquery 1.8.3 right now - i'm going to 1.11
[13:09:22] <Jattenalle> i jumped on the jquery train very recently, so i've only ever touched the 2.x.x
[13:09:29] <Jattenalle> what's the difference? other than 1.x being the older one, of course
[13:09:39] <duch_kazatel> actually the 1 series is the same age these days ;)
[13:09:49] <duch_kazatel> 1.11 and 2.11 have the same features.
[13:09:50] <Jattenalle> well, you know what i mean ;)
[13:09:55] <duch_kazatel> 2 drops support for old browsers.
[13:10:07] <Jattenalle> oh, that's the only difference?
[13:10:09] <duch_kazatel> yup
[13:10:13] <Jattenalle> well then
[13:10:16] <synth_> phttt old browsers.
[13:10:34] <duch_kazatel> synth_ as long as they're giving us money, we're supporting them.
[13:10:42] <Jattenalle> yeah, i mean who isnt using IE10 these days! *snickers*
[13:10:49] <synth_> yeah i'm jk
[13:10:59] <duch_kazatel> lol IE10's fine.
[13:11:01] <duch_kazatel> 11's good.
[13:11:07] <duch_kazatel> 9 is tolerable.
[13:11:14] <synth_> bing is amazing
[13:11:21] * drej blinks
[13:11:22] <Jattenalle> 10 is fine if you know what you're doing and change all the settings.. vanilla 10 is horror
[13:11:25] <Jattenalle> blocks all the things
[13:11:25] <BillCriswell> I'm cool with down to 8, everything below that can die.
[13:11:32] <duch_kazatel> vanilla 10's fine.
[13:12:00] <duch_kazatel> i'm with BillCriswell - down to 8's all good by me.
[13:12:36] <drej> i test all my sites down to IE5.5 on OSX
[13:12:43] <Jattenalle> well i'm lucky, i only need to care about a slightly outdated version of webkit
[13:12:47] <BillCriswell> drej: No one is that crazy.
[13:12:52] <duch_kazatel> drej ++
[13:12:53] <drej> OH IM CRAZY
[13:13:29] <BillCriswell> Haha
[13:13:35] <Jattenalle> lol
[13:13:56] <synth_> drej what kind of sites are you building?
[13:14:11] <drej> mostly for north korea
[13:14:16] <drej> (midget porn and what have you)
[13:14:22] <synth_> lol
[13:14:23] <duch_kazatel> i like this dude
[13:14:39] <Jattenalle> i believe, and trust, your words 100% drej
[13:14:50] <Jattenalle> i mean, who would go onto the itnernet and just lie? what kind of person would do that!?
[13:15:02] <BillCriswell> "what have you" is an odd expression.
[13:15:23] <drej> BillCriswell: some of us older folk have peculiar nomenclature for things
[13:15:39] <drej> Jattenalle: internet is the only place where everything is truth
[13:15:42] <BillCriswell> I'm not young by technology standards I don't think.
[13:15:59] <drej> BillCriswell: you know me anyway :)
[13:15:59] <diegoviola> hi
[13:16:02] <synth_> i get all of my news via email fwds
[13:16:17] <BillCriswell> I do? Sweeeeet
[13:16:29] <drej> == jedimind
[13:16:38] <duch_kazatel> but not ===
[13:16:42] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhhh
[13:16:48] <drej> nope, im now a boolean
[13:17:21] <diegoviola> i have this code here which warns the user about unsaved changes on a form, but this is also being triggered on form submit, how do i prevent that please? https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/9376762
[13:18:18] <dismist> perhaps you should try targetting more responsible users
[13:19:53] <diegoviola> dismist: they're not my users
[13:20:18] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola your event binding is all wrong.
[13:20:28] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola you're binding an event within another event.
[13:20:43] <duch_kazatel> so on every change you're binding.
[13:21:05] <diegoviola> so how do i fix this?
[13:21:58] <duch_kazatel> what is your code actually trying to do?
[13:22:31] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: just trying to warn the user when the form has data and is unsaved.
[13:22:40] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with marktiup jquery plugin?
[13:22:50] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: like when closing the browser tab, etc
[13:22:57] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola can you make a more complete example in jsfiddle?
[13:23:01] <duch_kazatel> because your code makes no sense.
[13:24:02] <diegoviola> ok
[13:24:16] <duch_kazatel> or, set a global var in your change function to say that a change has been made, then set that var to something else when saved.  then check the value in your onbeforeunload and display your warning as appropriate.
[13:24:25] <BillCriswell> Man, stripe checkout seems awesome.
[13:24:25] <duch_kazatel> brb
[13:33:08] <duch_kazatel> back
[13:38:55] <BillCriswell> Do you guys think you should get the HTML to be perfect then get the CMS to output that or do you think you should have to work around the HTML the CMS puts out?
[13:40:34] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/3hw2U/
[13:41:10] <cluster28> which event must i use to bind a function when a div is filled after an ajax request in .on() function?
[13:41:23] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: when i add text to that input and click submit i always get that warning, i want the warning only when i lose focus from the input and close the tab
[13:42:01] <cluster28> ive tried load, ready, change....
[13:42:33] <BillCriswell> cluster28: You'd use the success callback, if I'm understanding you right.
[13:42:53] <cluster28> in the ajax request?
[13:43:55] <BillCriswell> Yes, like $.ajax({url:'/foo', success: function(result){ $('.foo').html(result); someOtherStuff(); }});
[13:44:23] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola did you read what i said earlier?
[13:45:26] <cluster28> billcriswell: thank you, ill try
[13:47:17] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola http://jsfiddle.net/3hw2U/3/
[13:47:21] <duch_kazatel> you'll want something like that.
[13:47:21] <cluster28>  billcriswell: works fine, thanks
[13:48:28] <BillCriswell> No prob bob
[13:48:37] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: yes, thanks
[13:53:06] <nhulea> yo !
[13:53:22] <synth_> o herro prease
[14:08:23] <Starcraftmazter> hi, I have a download PDF action on my page which takes a while, does anyone know of any plugin which has a nice loading effect which appears on top of the page and is quite visible?
[14:09:30] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: You mean for like while the download is happening?
[14:11:07] <Starcraftmazter> BillCriswell: while the PDF is being generated
[14:11:12] <Starcraftmazter> this could take 10-20 seconds
[14:12:30] <BillCriswell> So you don't want any type of status while it's downloading, just as it's generating?
[14:14:42] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: You could do like $button.on('click', function(){ $loadingScreen.show(); $.ajax({ url: 'pdf-generator.whatever', success: function(){ $loadingScreen.hide(); }); });
[14:18:09] <Starcraftmazter> BillCriswell: im more interested in the visual aspect i guess
[14:18:14] <Starcraftmazter> its hard to find a good visual preloader
[14:18:53] <BillCriswell> There's so many different ways for them to look.
[14:20:22] <BillCriswell> If my idea of a preloaded is right.
[14:21:05] <duch_kazatel> wait you're downloading a pdf?
[14:21:10] <duch_kazatel> do the user's hard drive?
[14:21:21] <duch_kazatel> *to
[14:21:52] <BillCriswell> He wants to show an indefinite progress of the pdf generating, not the progress of the download.
[14:21:53] <Starcraftmazter> nvm
[14:22:06] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[14:23:55] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: Okie doke.
[14:24:17] <BillCriswell> I am out of here everyone. Take it easy!
[14:24:19] <Starcraftmazter> BillCriswell: you are correct in what i want to do
[14:24:41] <Starcraftmazter> im just surprised there isnt an easily reusable jquery/css thing to do it
[14:24:58] <duch_kazatel> for preloaders?  that's because of how easy it is.
[14:25:10] <duch_kazatel> though there's the server-side, too.
[14:26:07] <BillCriswell> .preload { position: fixed; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .2); display: none; } then you can toggle it.
[14:26:22] <BillCriswell> Ok really out this time!
[14:26:38] <obert> toggle is a verb, correct? to ggle
[14:27:11] <duch_kazatel> or noun.
[14:27:22] <duch_kazatel> depends on what you're describing.
[14:27:38] <obert> duch_kazatel: it was a joke
[14:27:41] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[14:27:49] <obert> to eat, to ggle, to hate
[14:27:56] <duch_kazatel> fair enough.
[14:28:08] <obert> :p
[14:28:14] <obert> gnite
[14:28:22] <duch_kazatel> enjoy
[14:41:08] <ezrafree> hello
[14:41:37] <ISmithers> What does $.csv.hooks.castToScalar actually do?
[14:44:04] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me why my function isn't running when i resize the window? http://pastebucket.com/30262
[14:45:07] <ezrafree> the jquery version is 1.10.2 if that matters
[15:25:39] <diegoviola> http://jsfiddle.net/4z7mR/ <-- how do i prevent that warning message that appears when i click on the foo link?
[15:26:59] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola would it be all anchors?  or just specific ones?
[15:27:18] <diegoviola> all for now
[15:27:41] <shoky> submitting the from is reloading the page.. so formSaved is never true really
[15:27:46] <shoky> form*
[15:28:05] <duch_kazatel> shoky I wroke the original code :)
[15:28:14] <shoky> oh ;]
[15:28:33] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola can you give us a more complete example of your page?
[15:28:53] <duch_kazatel> because it's hard to give a complete example.
[15:29:24] <frank_o> Hiya
[15:30:05] <frank_o> Working on this mobile touch indicator here.. http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/8pr9J/ .. anybody know why it won't let me click the same place twice?
[15:31:10] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: https://github.com/diegoviola/fromthepage/blob/in_place_replacement/app/views/display/display_page.html.erb
[15:31:37] <m1chael> i'm having some troubles with jquery mobile (http://www.infobuzz.me:8005/add-sighting/), and typeahead (http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) .. i'm trying to set the width on the "Celebrity" text box to 100%, but I cannot get it to extend for the life of me. does anyone have any ideas on why that might be happening?
[15:32:48] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: what i'm doing here is, i have a link "add comment" which triggers a form, then i have this code which warn the user about losing unsaved form changes, but i also have on the same page edit and delete comment links, which trigger this warning when i click on them
[15:33:08] <duch_kazatel> diegoviola is this ajax driven at all?
[15:33:16] <diegoviola> so i want to avoid triggering this warning when clicking on the edit/delete links
[15:33:24] <diegoviola> duch_kazatel: this form for comments? no
[15:33:54] <duch_kazatel> okay, then we need a different approach.
[15:34:03] <duch_kazatel> i'm in a meeting otherwise i would hash it out for you ;)
[15:34:37] <diegoviola> no worries, thanks for the help, i'm just not sure where to look at
[15:35:12] <grizly_> frank_o: interesting..
[15:35:31] <Ownix> This keeps giving me the whole element by ID
[15:35:32] <Ownix> var staticTile = $('#flipTileToolbox:first-child').clone();
[15:35:49] <Ownix> I simply want the div inside of $('#flipTileToolbox')
[15:38:23] <grizly_> frank_o: I can get it.. just, but it goes too far.
[15:39:43] <grizly_> frank_o: oh, looks like you have it, what was it? (I was going a jQuery('.typeahead').parents().each(function(){ jQuery(this).width("100%"); }); route)
[15:40:40] <gnarf> um
[15:40:48] <gnarf> grizly_: why each to .width ?
[15:41:15] <gnarf> .css("width", "100%") along with pretty much every jQuery method does an implicit each
[15:43:43] <frank_o> grizly_: Was that for me? :)
[15:43:46] <frank_o> Might have me confused with somebody else
[15:44:57] <Ownix> I figured it out. I have to change the ID after I clone.
[15:45:19] <grizly_> ahh.. yeah. ;-)
[15:45:42] <grizly_> m1chael actually, was the intended recipient, but he appears to have fixed it
[15:46:02] <shoky> frank_o:  the 2nd click is triggered on on the touch indicator itself
[15:46:47] <grizly_> gnarf: Does it? I didn't know that.. both awesome and odd.
[15:48:11] <frank_o> shoky: Cool
[15:48:40] <m1chael> grizly_: thank you for your info.. i didn't quite do it your way, but your response is certainly worth documenting!
[15:48:53] <frank_o> one sec
[15:49:05] <m1chael> i'm trying to change the color on the jquery mobile button now
[15:49:13] <grizly_> m1chael: well, mine worked too well, things wen't way off screen ;-)
[15:49:34] <m1chael> haha, this stuff can make you crazy
[15:49:55] <frank_o> shoky: I gotta add $('#touchIndicatorDiv').hide(); somewhere right?
[15:50:28] <shoky> frank_o: i dunno, that'd only help if you hide it after the animation is complete. what if you click 2nd time before the animation is done?
[15:51:01] <frank_o> shoky: Ah, yeah good point..
[15:59:50] <frank_o> shoky: There was one dude though who basically said if I experienced problems on mobile I could always "use translateZ to promote it to a new layer" -- that make any sense?
[16:05:11] <shoky> frank_o: no idea
[16:05:50] <greg5green> if you're having performance issues that might help
[16:06:03] <greg5green> if i remember correctly, translateZ is often done on the gpu
[16:06:11] <greg5green> or at least gpu assisted
[16:09:05] <CrazednDazed> I moved a site which uses jcarousellite plugin from one server to another  (windows to linux) and now the jcarousellite, on the new site, doesn't display  images only on the home page.  It's on every page, and as soon as you click  somewhere else, the images show up, get cached, and appear everywhere.  But when  you first visit the home page there are no images in jcarousellite (only on the
[16:09:26] <CrazednDazed> new server)
[16:11:08] <CrazednDazed> If I use firefox, occasionally the images show up on the first visit to the home page.  If I use chrome (clearing the cache each time), they Never show up on the first visit.
[16:14:54] <duch_kazatel> so hard to get any motivation now.
[16:23:19] <simpleuser> Hi there. Little problem here : http://jsfiddle.net/q9H4k/ My script works perfectly except for one thing. If I click on the <a>, no problem, but if I click on the left icon, it selects all (as if I did Ctrl+A). Any idea how to change this behavior?
[16:25:51] <hybridark> hi folks
[16:26:10] <grizly_> simpleuser: http://jsfiddle.net/q9H4k/1/
[16:26:44] <grizly_> simpleuser: seems to work fine
[16:27:16] <hybridark> have you ever seen jquery modify a <nav> tag after the html is already loaded and put an inline style with a fixed height in it?
[16:27:49] <duch_kazatel> hybridark not by default.
[16:27:57] <hybridark> that height is not in the html and not in the css either..
[16:28:09] <duch_kazatel> a plugin maybe?
[16:28:24] <nhulea> wow .find is pretty powerful
[16:28:27] <hybridark> I've used firebug to stop where that change was being made and it stops at jquery
[16:28:40] <duch_kazatel> hybridark right because something is calling jquery to make the change.
[16:28:44] <duch_kazatel> look at the call stack,
[16:31:38] <simpleuser> grizly_, what did you do? It doesn't change anything for me. The behavior is the same :)
[16:31:40] <hybridark> but the height it puts there is nowhere in the project, as I've made a search in the whole project and didn't find it. http://i.imgur.com/C7h1dbj.png
[16:31:58] <duch_kazatel> hybridark what plugins do you have?
[16:32:10] <duch_kazatel> hybridark jquery does not munge with markup unless something tells it to.
[16:33:07] <grizly_> simpleuser: added a filter to the parent selector, so the click bubbles properly, it seems to work as designed, perhaps you need to clarify the error you are seeing?
[16:33:56] <grizly_> simpleuser: also, added console logging, to verify which elem was clicked, and sure enough, that element's children are correctly (I assume) toggling the selected classes.
[16:34:17] <simpleuser> oh ok thanks grizly_ . But it doesn't change the thing for me
[16:34:42] <simpleuser> grizly_, don't you have this behavior that selects all ? I mean when you click on the icon on the left, it highlight the <a>
[16:34:58] <grizly_> simpleuser: nope, it doesn't do that at all.. which browser are you using?
[16:35:11] <simpleuser> firefox
[16:35:17] <simpleuser> you're right, i'm gonna try chrome
[16:35:22] <grizly_> ahh, chrome.. just tested FF, yup, seeing it
[16:35:46] <simpleuser> oh you're right
[16:35:57] <simpleuser> on chromium, no prob
[16:36:04] <simpleuser> but firefox does the bad behavior
[16:36:07] <simpleuser> mmm
[16:36:15] <hybridark> duch_kazatel, I have jquery.nivo.slider.js, jquery.maskedinput.js, jquery.validate.js, facebox.js . Commented them all and nothing changed
[16:39:43] <Whirl3d> When I say var rw=$("<tr id='something'></tr>"); console.log(rw.html()); I get nothing...any explanation why?
[16:40:54] <shoky> Whirl3d  .html() gives the .innerHTML
[16:43:16] <Whirl3d> wow. I cannot tell you how many times I have messed that up without knowing until today. Tragic, really.
[16:43:30] <tw2113> you learn Whirl3d
[16:43:32] <Whirl3d> best way to get outer html? (I see lots of googleresults)
[16:43:38] <shoky> .prop('outerHTML')
[16:44:24] <tw2113> i heard shoky learned something once
[16:44:26] <tw2113> never again
[16:44:47] <Whirl3d> when you learn it all once, you don't need to learn it again, right Shoky!
[16:45:16] <shoky> uhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes. re-learning is for wimps
[16:45:22] <gnarf> Whirl3d: shoky: that relys on the browser supporting outerHTML
[16:45:36] <Whirl3d> thanks for the help. I thought it was because you can't have an unassigned <tr> element
[16:45:55] <shoky> gnarf: yep but today they all support it, no?
[16:50:42] <frank_o> shoky: #touchIndicatorDiv { pointer-events: none; } fixed it
[16:51:07] <grizly_> simpleuser: I got rid of it, but its not right.. that shouldn't happen! http://jsfiddle.net/q9H4k/7/
[16:51:14] <shoky> frank_o: i tried that yeah, it didn't compeltely fix it. also pointer-events isn't supported in all browsers
[16:51:32] <gnarf> shoky: shrug, probably?
[16:51:33] <gnarf> :)
[16:51:45] <gnarf> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.outerHTML
[16:52:02] <simpleuser> Great !! Thank you so much grizly_ ! :)
[16:52:08] <shoky> yah firefox was the last problematic one
[16:53:46] <shoky> frank_o: specifically, it's not supported on IE10 and below..
[16:54:15] <frank_o> shoky: thats ok really, this ones for newer mobile devices only
[16:54:32] <shoky> cool
[16:54:52] <frank_o> shoky: in that case pointer-events is ok?
[16:55:09] <grizly_> simpleuser: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6190143/javascript-set-window-selection still not sure why, I tried changing to an older version of jQuery or fiddling with stuff.. but I can't see it.
[16:55:13] <shoky> frank_o:  http://caniuse.com/pointer-events
[16:55:24] <frank_o> ah yeah forgot about that one
[16:55:42] <Whirl3d> How do you make a text element inside a span element unselectable?
[16:56:23] <shoky> there's a few ways, i always forget which is best
[16:57:23] <frank_o> thanks shoky, i guess it's sorta well supported :)
[16:57:57] <simpleuser> grizly_, thanks for the information :)
[16:58:14] <shoky> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/c8tcH/
[16:58:28] <frank_o> props for being one step ahead of everyone like usual
[16:59:36] <shoky> Whirl3d tho it doesn't work that great
[17:02:05] <shoky> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/c8tcH/1/
[17:20:25] <grizly_> simpleuser: http://jsfiddle.net/q9H4k/8/ this version seems to work better.. turned off the ability to select the text at all..
[17:21:00] <simpleuser> grizly_, haha, come on you can take a small break you now... I can't pay you for your work...
[17:21:03] <simpleuser> Thank you so much :)
[17:21:32] <simpleuser> grizly_, You think it's cross browser ?
[17:22:01] <grizly_> probably..
[17:22:24] <simpleuser> grizly_, ok, just to know :)
[17:22:29] <simpleuser> Thank you so much for your work
[17:22:35] <simpleuser> \o/
[17:22:54] <grizly_> It really shouldn't have been necessary, I've never seen that before.. ;-|
[17:23:07] <grizly_> still, a chance to learn is a chance to learn
[17:26:24] <simpleuser> grizly_, yep
[17:35:10] <xmath279> http://xmath.ca/mobile/?p=12&blogid=9 Can anyone tell me why it heads back to the homepage when we click on "Connexion" ?
[17:41:31] <grizly_> xmath279: its a submit button, so your form is being submitted
[17:41:57] <xmath279> yea but on the desktop version, it does not head back to the homepage...
[17:42:10] <xmath279> http://xmath.ca/?p=12&blogid=9
[17:44:33] <grizly_> hmm.. curious
[18:04:25] <grizly_> xmath279: try this: $('form[name="connect"]').get(0).setAttribute('action',window.location.pathname);
[18:04:41] <grizly_> gah, nope, that still has it wrong
[18:04:51] <xmath279> i guess i got it fixed, but I don't know how...
[18:05:29] <grizly_> This one: $('form[name="connect"]').get(0).setAttribute('action',$(location).attr('href'));
[18:05:30] <grizly_> It works
[18:05:52] <grizly_> There was no action on the form, so it was submitting without the query string
[18:05:56] <grizly_> to the index.php file basically
[18:06:32] <grizly_> I assumed because you asked in #jquery that you wanted a jQuery solution.. ;-)
[18:06:54] * grizly_ goes to lunch
[18:16:28] <luvmyh0nda> back: [reason: Idle after 10h][gone: 8h52m40s][]
[18:16:28] <luvmyh0nda> I have 3 tabs, (indexed 0,1 & 2). Tab 2 is an add-tab function, which takes the user to an AJAX page, which opens another tab (tab 3). Tab 2(add tab) is then removed, tab 3 (new tab) becomes tab 2, and then the "add tab" (tab which was previously 2) now becomes tab 4.
[18:17:07] <luvmyh0nda> Sorry, tab which was previously 2, becomes tab 3.
[18:17:45] <luvmyh0nda> If the new tab 2 is closed, it automatically goes to the next-highest tab in the index, which is the new tab, and it re-opens another window. How do I set tabs(remove) to select the next-lowest index?
[18:18:14] <luvmyh0nda> *If the new tab 2 is closed, it automatically goes to the next-highest tab in the index, which is the ADD tab, and it re-opens another window. How do I set tabs(remove) to select the next-lowest index?
[18:37:31] <grizly_> luvmyh0nda: have you got a fiddle/demo ?
[18:37:39] <luvmyh0nda> no, BUT, i did figure it out
[18:37:54] * grizly_ is happy with that
[18:37:58] <luvmyh0nda> 		if (index == $tabs.tabs('option','active')) { $tabs.tabs('option','active',index-1); }

[18:38:34] <Kal_crunchbang> Hello there when i .load a page it adds alot of nothing on
[18:39:25] <luvmyh0nda> Kal_crunchbang: nothing like whitespaces, breaks, or paragraphs?
[18:39:29] <Kal_crunchbang> any ideads who i can fix this
[18:39:33] <Kal_crunchbang> breaks
[18:39:46] <luvmyh0nda> is the load() returning breaks?
[18:40:19] <Kal_crunchbang> not in view source
[18:40:39] <luvmyh0nda> is there any css which may be causing the issue?
[18:41:58] <Kal_crunchbang> http://jsfiddle.net/9aTGH/
[18:42:36] <Kal_crunchbang> not showing on thier and all chat.html has is OverlordKing :hello
[18:46:18] <Kal_crunchbang> any gueses why?
[18:49:02] <luvmyh0nda> perhaps something with the height:100%'s may be messing with you
[18:57:42] <marpstar> quick question: does the migrate plugin support 2.x?
[18:58:09] <Kal_crunchbang> ??
[18:59:19] <shoky> marpstar: yes
[19:00:08] <marpstar> shoky: thank you. it's hard to tell because the docs only seem to refer to 1.9+
[19:00:19] <shoky> marpstar: but it doesn't restore any oldIE functionality that is lost when moving from 1.9 to 2.0
[19:00:41] <marpstar> shoky: definitely worth noting, thank god I only have to support IE10+
[19:04:13] <grizly_> Kal_crunchbang: why does it load chat.html every second?
[19:05:08] <Kal_crunchbang> to keep it as fast updating as possible
[19:05:21] <Kal_crunchbang> i have akamai so its fine to do that
[19:05:38] <luvmyh0nda> Kal_crunchbang: have you looked into node
[19:05:55] <luvmyh0nda> or (depending on your back-end) a memcache?
[19:06:03] <Kal_crunchbang> yes. i prefere jquery
[19:06:21] <luvmyh0nda> Kal_crunchbang: not instead of jquery, but using node for a back-end to get the content?
[19:06:49] <Kal_crunchbang> i doesn't run very with that
[19:12:17] <grizly_> Kal_crunchbang: have you got this hosted somewhere? I don't see the "breaks" issue with this code
[19:13:25] <Kal_crunchbang> did but i removed the page due to it being a newsence add me and contact me next time im online
[19:14:00] <grizly_> you could just post the actual code to pastebin or such
[19:15:35] <Kal_crunchbang> it was the same code as i sent you
[19:15:45] <Kal_crunchbang> anyway igtg bye
[19:15:58] <grizly_> but thats not even a page..
[19:15:59] <luvmyh0nda> well that was
[19:16:01] <grizly_> ok, see ya
[19:17:33] <grizly_> yup
[20:52:06] <cprodigy29> How do I use the jsonp api to grab the data from this url https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/text/en/bob_dylan?callback=insertReply
[20:52:44] <cprodigy29> they have an example here from flickr http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[20:52:56] <cprodigy29> but how do I change it to work with this url?
[20:53:52] <grizly_> cprodigy29: https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/working-with-jsonp/
[20:54:13] <grizly_> Its a bit different because its not on your server
[20:56:52] <luvmyh0nda> cprodigy29: are you using PHP or something of the sort?
[20:58:06] <cprodigy29> luvmyh0nda: no just jquery
[20:58:29] <cprodigy29> luvmyh0nda: eventually I need to be able to grab data from an app and display it in my phonegap app
[20:58:55] <luvmyh0nda> i was going to say, to make life a bit easier because of the cross-domain stuff, you can use a local PHP file to get the contents of the URL.
[20:59:07] <luvmyh0nda> and then just call that script so it works as a local call
[20:59:23] <cprodigy29> yea I had saw some stuff about that
[20:59:42] <luvmyh0nda> yeah, it's actually pretty simple
[20:59:44] <shoky> cprodigy29: http://jsfiddle.net/qGcLn/
[21:00:30] <cprodigy29> shoky: thanks a million
[21:00:51] <cprodigy29> shoky: i had the ?callback=insertReply in there
[21:06:18] <cprodigy29> shoky: you prefer .done vs success:
[21:06:35] <shoky> yep
[21:06:59] <cprodigy29> shoky: ok thanks again
[21:07:07] <shoky> np
[21:09:33] <cprodigy29> shoky: then i can just append the date to a div
[21:09:44] <cprodigy29> *data
[21:11:04] <shoky> yuh
[21:11:40] <cprodigy29> now what about if my data looks like this http://pastebin.com/RCJR815P
[21:12:40] <shoky> then data is an array
[21:13:19] <cprodigy29> shoky: i'm going to try to figure it out right now
[21:17:44] <cprodigy29> shoky: would this be the next line
[21:17:45] <cprodigy29> shoky:  $.each( data.items, function( item ) {
[21:18:04] <shoky> why data.items?
[21:18:29] <shoky> and $.each puts the index as first argument, and the value as 2nd item.. so function(i, item)
[21:18:47] <cprodigy29> shoky: idk i saw it in an example.. not gonna lie lol
[21:18:56] <shoky> data is the array, not data.items
[21:20:19] <shoky> don't just copy random examples :\
[21:20:51] <cprodigy29> shoky: this is the example http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[21:20:58] <cprodigy29> shoky: why do they use data.item?
[21:21:13] <cprodigy29> shoky: i looked at the feed and didn't see item anywhere
[21:21:29] <cprodigy29> *items
[21:22:28] <shoky> cprodigy29: http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?jsoncallback=bla&format=json
[21:22:35] <shoky> there's an "items" field
[21:22:42] <cprodigy29> damn
[21:23:18] <cprodigy29> shoky: i typed in this one http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?jsoncallback=?
[21:23:45] <shoky> that's not the full url. they are also sending url parameters
[21:23:58] <shoky> format: "json"
[21:24:04] <cprodigy29> the tags, tag mode, and format
[21:24:07] <cprodigy29> i see now
[21:26:34] <cprodigy29> shoky: so $.each( data, function( i, contact ) {
[21:26:47] <cprodigy29> contacts are what I'm pulling
[21:27:15] <shoky> make a jsfiddle dude
[21:27:23] <cprodigy29> ok
[21:27:28] <shoky> i mean, if you have a question ;p
[21:28:54] <cprodigy29> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/qGcLn/2/
[21:28:59] <cprodigy29> shoky: sorry about that
[21:29:26] <cprodigy29> shoky: but my url is local
[21:30:14] <shoky> hm?
[21:30:16] <cprodigy29> i put how the data look in the html field
[21:30:20] <cprodigy29> if you refresh
[21:30:31] <cprodigy29> *looks
[21:31:06] <cprodigy29> shoky: so thats the data i'm trying to format
[21:31:57] <shoky> if i refresh?
[21:32:03] <shoky> you need to update it and give a new link
[21:32:13] <shoky> and what do you mean "my url is local"
[21:32:37] <cprodigy29> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/yRr6c/
[21:32:52] <cprodigy29> shoky: the url that I'm pulling the json from is a local url from a rails dev app
[21:33:34] <shoky> if it's local why are you using jsonp?
[21:33:55] <shoky> anyway.. do you have a question?
[21:34:49] <dilligaf> Should i include jquery in the HEAD of the document OR @ the end of the BODY
[21:35:12] <cprodigy29> shoky: why is it not alerting the data
[21:35:40] <cprodigy29> I used Chrome developer and it's getting the request
[21:36:52] <shoky> cprodigy29: in the fiddle?
[21:37:30] <shoky> cprodigy29: does your server even support JSONP?
[21:37:36] <cprodigy29> shoky: no i just put it in the fiddle so you can see if my code is right
[21:38:00] <shoky> it looks ok.. assuming the server supports jsonp
[21:38:10] <cprodigy29> shoky: if it gets the json with 200 ok then it should be fine right?
[21:38:15] <shoky> nope
[21:38:22] <shoky> the server has to support jsonp, then it should be fine
[21:38:27] <cprodigy29> shoky: I'm using developer tools in chrome
[21:38:31] <cprodigy29> shoky: ok let me see
[21:38:35] <shoky> if you dont know what jsonp is, that's a problem.
[21:38:50] <cprodigy29> shoky: i know what it is.. well just from reading about it
[21:38:56] <shoky> oks
[21:39:06] <shoky> why are you trying to use it
[21:41:15] <cprodigy29> shoky: to get data from my app to a mobile app
[21:41:38] <dilligaf> Can you here me ?
[21:42:35] <cprodigy29> shoky: I got it
[21:42:46] <cprodigy29> shoky: rails has built in json support
[21:42:58] <cprodigy29> shoky: all i needed to do was add :callback => params[:callback]
[21:43:10] <cprodigy29> shoky: render :json => @contacts.as_json( :methods => [:visual_url]), :callback => params[:callback]
[21:43:25] <cprodigy29> shoky: that adds the jsonp support
[21:44:10] <shoky> goody
[21:46:16] <cprodigy29> shoky: I'm super happy lol  :D
[21:46:43] <shoky> ;] try not to burst
[21:48:20] <cprodigy29> shoky: explain this to me please
[21:48:32] <cprodigy29> shoky: how does $( "<img>" ) just create the whole image tag lol
[21:48:53] <cprodigy29> shoky: well this $( "<img>" ).attr( "src", contact.visual_url )
[21:54:29] <cprodigy29> shoky: nm
[22:12:50] <cprodigy29> ok working on my jQuery skills.. does this look sloppy http://pastebin.com/iE2946QN
[22:14:11] <cprodigy29> I wanted the h2 and img to be wrapped in a div
[22:23:05] <grizly_> cprodigy29: try https://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[22:24:04] <renierdebruyn> Hi, is there a way to se if an object property has a value?
[22:24:51] <grizly_> .attr().is()?
[22:25:25] <grizly_> https://api.jquery.com/attr/
[22:26:12] <renierdebruyn> thanks will check it out
[22:29:18] <cprodigy29> grizly_: not sure how that's going to work
[22:30:31] <zumba_ad_> hey guys, we had a meeting this morning and we were planning to refactor our application from scratch. We had a new guy come in and he recommended that we use Gumby Framework. What would be your recommendation?
[22:32:33] <jtri> hello, I am binding a click handler to a group of checkboxes, and passing "this" into the handler, so I can alert(cb.value) for example, and it works fine, wondering how to find another input node, namely a text input, which is in the same table row as the checkbox cb?
[22:33:03] <luvmyh0nda> jtri: i just dealt with this myself
[22:33:19] <jtri> was tempted to try something like $(cb).next or something like that, but $(cb) itself fails, i think
[22:33:19] <luvmyh0nda> the method i used (not saying it's the best), depending on where your input is
[22:33:37] <jtri> luvmyh0nda: did you solve it?
[22:33:56] <luvmyh0nda> $(this).parent().parent().children('td').eq(column#).children('input')
[22:34:09] <luvmyh0nda> assuming your text boxes are in a specific column #
[22:34:44] <luvmyh0nda> i'm certain there's a shorter way, probably using grandparents and nth
[22:34:53] <luvmyh0nda> but i can confirm that one works
[22:34:53] <jtri> hahahahaha :)  oh jquery, you are something
[22:35:14] <jtri> looks pretty decent...
[22:35:36] <jtri> i just have to give my columns some numbers, i guess?
[22:35:41] <luvmyh0nda> nope
[22:35:45] <luvmyh0nda> column 1 = 0
[22:35:49] <luvmyh0nda> column 2 = 1
[22:35:50] <luvmyh0nda> etc
[22:35:53] <luvmyh0nda> so if it were the 3rd column
[22:36:03] <luvmyh0nda> $(this).parent().parent().children('td').eq(2).children('input')
[22:36:11] <cprodigy29> grizly_: can you give me an example please
[22:36:11] <jtri> oh, hm, eq is just an index finder?
[22:36:17] <luvmyh0nda> yes
[22:36:23] <jtri> ic ic
[22:40:11] <grizly_> cprodigy29: example of attr?
[22:40:57] <cprodigy29> grizly_: http://pastebin.com/iE2946QN
[22:41:53] <luvmyh0nda> jtri: did that one work for you?
[22:42:34] <jtri> having a bit of trouble with "this" b/c my handler calls the argument it gets cb... still working on it
[22:42:35] <cprodigy29> grizly_: I'm getting back a json response  and basically i want <div id="sample"><div><h2> contact.first_name</h2><img blah /></div></sample>
[22:42:45] <jtri> not sure what I get in the handler, and what to call it...
[22:42:49] <luvmyh0nda> do you have a fiddle?
[22:42:54] <cprodigy29> grizly_: if that makes sense
[22:43:09] <jtri> binding happens like this: $("#"+Node.id).find(":checkbox").click(function(){Check_Click(this);});
[22:43:21] <jtri> inside Check_Click is where i want it to work...
[22:43:29] <grizly_> aye sort of, but you don't have to do all of them at once.
[22:43:39] <luvmyh0nda> function Check_Click(newThis)
[22:43:50] <luvmyh0nda> $(newThis).parent().parent().children('td').eq(2).children('input')
[22:44:05] <cprodigy29> grizly_: ?
[22:45:03] <cprodigy29> grizly_: i want that h2 and img to be wrapped in a div
[22:45:38] <luvmyh0nda> brb getting my fix
[22:45:47] <grizly_> cprodigy29: http://jsfiddle.net/vg8pk/
[22:45:49] <cprodigy29> grizly_: for ever iteration it should be div h2 img /div and then those in container div
[22:46:08] <grizly_> I'm going home for the night, but that should work, no need for loads of work, you might be overthinking it.
[22:46:46] <cprodigy29> grizly_: ok thanks I'll check it out
[22:47:02] <grizly_> ahh, http://jsfiddle.net/vg8pk/1/
[22:47:04] <grizly_> yeah. :-)
[22:47:05] <grizly_> Night all
[22:49:16] <luvmyh0nda> and i'm back
[22:49:26] <luvmyh0nda> jtri: any luck with that yet?
[22:51:07] <cprodigy29> that's perfect
[22:53:03] <jtri> luvmyh0nda, not quite... i can alert and get object, but can't seem to use the object... i think the object i'm getting is the text input i'm shooting for, but still not quite making it work
[22:53:24] <luvmyh0nda> so what's the goal, to enable/disable and/or focus the text box?
[22:53:27] <jtri> currently trying: $("#"+Node.id).find(":checkbox").click(function(){Check_Click(this, $(this).parent().parent().children('td').eq(1).children('input'));});
[22:54:07] <jtri> in theory that would pass in "cb" and "tb" so my Chekc_Click(cb, tb) looks like that...
[22:54:25] <jtri> cb for checkbox, and tb for textbox
[22:54:41] <luvmyh0nda> ok, give me a couple of minutes
[22:54:47] <luvmyh0nda> let me make a fiddle and see what we can do here
[22:55:02] <jtri> i'm trying to hide() and show() the textbox, and/or get it's .value
[22:57:44] <CrazyZurfer> hey guys... I'm trying to copy jquery mobile's theme, but everything is too weird... there's a javascript that changes someway the left panel, and I include this index.js to my html file but the panel goes down, like it doesn't fit
[23:00:53] <luvmyh0nda> jtri: <3 http://jsfiddle.net/76xQx/
[23:00:56] <CrazyZurfer> watch this ( http://jsfiddle.net/p6K6t/ ) when the width of the box is big, then the panel goes to the bottom
[23:02:30] <jtri> ok, checking, i just did an inspect too, and realized i might have some extra div tags and other stuff messing up the selector
[23:04:28] <jtri> indeed, i see your example, works like a charm, i must be close, i think the extra tags are throwing me off, i forgot they were there
[23:04:40] <luvmyh0nda> that could be doing it
[23:25:30] <jtri> luvmyh0nda: got it! console.log(tb.parents('tr').children('td').eq(1).find('input')[0].value);
[23:26:17] <luvmyh0nda> nice!
[23:26:19] <Cork> jtri: i could recommend using .closest instead of parents
[23:26:51] <luvmyh0nda> yeah, doesn't parents traverse up the tree?
[23:26:55] <Cork> cause you can get the wrong element with parents if you have the table wrapped in another table
[23:27:02] <Cork> so does closest
[23:27:12] <Cork> except closest only goes until it finds one
[23:27:20] <Cork> parents go until it hits document
[23:27:25] <Cork> and then collects all matches
[23:30:04] <jtri> ok, yep, closest works (too/better)
[23:32:28] <jtri> kapooey, the hide() method didn't work on it though... i think i'm confused about when something is a jquery object, and when it's not... when/how can i apply .hide(), apparently not to the same object i can call .value ?
[23:33:13] <luvmyh0nda> tb & cb are both jquery objects
[23:33:24] <jtri> looking back at the fiddle, yeah
[23:33:41] <luvmyh0nda> the console.log, you're targeting the text box
[23:33:43] <luvmyh0nda> not the check box
[23:33:45] <jtri> i think throwing the [0] on there makes it not hideable?
[23:34:18] <luvmyh0nda> you shouldn't need the []
[23:34:24] <jtri> sure enough
[23:34:29] <luvmyh0nda> because there's only one input in the td, correct?
[23:34:45] <jtri> yes, only 1
[23:35:00] <luvmyh0nda> in that case, there would be no need for the index
[23:35:30] <Cork> jtri: you don't need [0] if you use .val() instead of .value
