[00:31:19] <tkil> hi.  i'm using jquery.svg, and i seem to have hover text that includes a function definition of some sort (either on the svg itself, or on an image i'm embedding, checking now.
[00:31:53] <tkil> http://foiani.home.dyndns.org/~tony/jq/jquery_svg-float_text.png  is an example.  and it seems to appear over any svg element, not just the image.
[00:37:15] <tkil> hm.  looks like jquery.svg is setting the 'title' attribute on the $.prototype ...
[00:37:31] <tkil> er. $.extend( SVGWrapper.prototype rather
[00:38:32] <tkil> hm.  can probably just patch things so jquery.svn uses "setTitle" or similar...
[00:38:46] * tkil goes to look at jquery.svg's devel methodology.
[00:39:08] <tkil> and damned but my fingers hate to type "jquery.svg".   .svn?  .xfg?
[00:39:17] * tkil drinks more.
[01:24:56] <rahmen> Hi! I've been looking for a jquery file uploader that handles cross domain. There's this iframe way of doing it but iframes can't handle cross domain. Is there a workaround? I've also read that html5 can do ajax uploads and I assume there's a jsonp way to do it. But IE can't handle the html5 part. So I would like to use the iframe way that works in IE, FF and chrome. Anyone here with...
[01:24:58] <rahmen> ...experience from this?
[01:31:15] <rgr> every time I implement radio buttons they never seem to default to the right button. checked="checked" or value="1" on one element?
[01:31:25] <rgr> gah
[01:36:54] <faraway> rgr: checked tells which radio button of the group is check ¬ø?
[01:37:39] <rgr> so it should. but googling shows just CHECKED or checked="checked". Damned if I can get it filled in. The focus is on that check alright. But the button isnt coloured in.
[01:38:33] <faraway> rgr: checked or checked="checked" should be the same, as soon as checked is present it should be checked
[01:41:45] <rgr> faraway: thats what I thought. Im not really a hardcore css/html/jquery person but done enough. Can you look at this img and see if you see why the "basic" radio might not be on. Cant provide a sample sorry. http://i.imgur.com/qZefa.png
[01:41:48] <faraway> rahmen: afaik you can trigger a submit on a form that has the target to an iframe whcih does a cross domain post. the problem is that you can get the response (if post is finished and worked) directly, so you need to do a scond jsonp request
[01:44:10] <elephphant> Hi Everyone :)
[01:44:29] <faraway> rgr: do you have another inout element with the name advl that has the attr checked ?
[01:44:38] <rgr> no
[01:44:40] <elephphant> Im having an issue with JQuery getting the checkbox rather then the hidden value in a table when an accordian is closed : http://jsfiddle.net/4FypP/16/
[01:44:54] <faraway> rgr: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/tv2wR/
[01:45:54] <jrockjiggz> how to scrollTo(bottom) ?
[01:46:50] <elephphant> jrockjiggz: scrollTo($("body").innerHeight()); ?
[01:47:25] <jrockjiggz> elephphant: ahh thanks
[01:47:48] <elephphant> jrockjiggz: havent used it but i assumet hat would work ;)
[01:48:44] <burnt-work> hey :)
[01:49:23] <burnt-work> I need a jquery soloution that will allow divs to be movable
[01:49:34] <rgr>       <input id="basicchk" type="radio"  name="editorpaneselection" checked  onClick='$(".editorpane").css("display","none");$("#basicedits").css("display","block");' value="basic"/>
[01:49:34] <rgr>  
[01:49:51] <zapsoda> Is there i can make the page not load or not display intell its all done loading?
[01:49:58] <ak> burnt-work: try jquery ui draggable maybe
[01:50:25] <burnt-work> I am using a dragable object on the div itself, but I would love to be able to position the div, so I have a div and I drag things onto it, but I would like to move the dragable div about the screen and the rest of the divs to order based on where I move it. thanks in advance
[01:51:50] <faraway> elephphant: :hidden is not input[type='hidden']
[01:52:22] <faraway> elephphant: :hidden matches all elements that are not vsibiel, so if accordion is closed not only the hidden input field is hidden ;)
[01:52:39] <tram> Good morning all, does anyone know if its possible to start a event when the background-image of a div is pressed(abouy 10% of a div has a bg, and i want to start a function when that part gets clicked)?
[01:53:18] <elephphant> faraway: yeh i just realised that and fixed self before you posted
[01:53:31] <elephphant> faraway: thanks anyway :D
[01:53:54] <blackpowa> http://ts-baileyjay.com/
[01:54:04] <faraway> elephphant: np .. it is even better that you found out yourself :D
[01:58:12] <zapsoda> Is there i can make the page not load or not display intell its all done loading?

[02:04:02] <faraway> zapsoda: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/vCSKe/
[02:04:43] <zapsoda> Awesome Thank you faraway
[02:06:08] <jayflux> could anyone tell me how I can make this less buggy? I thought this should be simple
[02:06:09] <jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/4D3EJ/1/
[02:07:03] <Crawn> Having problems with the Accordion... anyone know a bit about autoHeight and remember state?
[02:07:09] <blackpowa> ccrawn
[02:07:11] <blackpowa> ur so h ot
[02:07:45] <Crawn> ...why thank you But how can you know i'm sweating like a pig :P
[02:08:35] <faraway> jayflux: well problem is that the size of the element changes while mousenter and mouseleave, thats why it is flickering
[02:08:53] <jayflux> faraway:  why isn't it changing back to text when you mouseout?
[02:09:13] <tram> Can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/3hkPq/ i want to be able to use the BG img of a div for the selector
[02:10:53] <faraway> jayflux: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/4D3EJ/2/
[02:11:39] <faraway> jayflux: as i sayed cause of the size changes, the events get messed up cause while you cahnge the content the state (if the mouse is inside or outside) is not correct anymore
[02:12:03] <jayflux> faraway: ahh I see
[02:12:06] <jayflux> Makes sense i suppose
[02:14:14] <faraway> jayflux: i don't know if it is a browser bug or a jquery bug, could be both because only ie/opera natively supports mouseenter/mouseleave for the other browsers jquery emulates this events.
[02:14:54] <jayflux> should i just switch to mouseover and mouseout then instead:
[02:15:03] <faraway> jayflux: no
[02:15:21] <Crawn> http://3052812.shop18.dandomain.dk When using jquery.accordion.1.8.22.js the menu on the left side can't remember state for submenu-items... if i use 1.7 it remembers state, but then the height of the submenu does not collapse... any ideas?
[02:16:54] <faraway> jayflux: i guess that you will have more problems with mouseover and mouseout
[02:17:25] <Kit-10> faraway: ping
[02:17:39] <faraway> jayflux: i would make sure that the elements won't change in with, which is anyway a good idea for not frustration the user
[02:17:43] <faraway> Kit-10: pong
[02:17:45] <Kit-10> that blasted IE9 issue i was having yesterday,
[02:17:48] <asteig> My god. I'm going crazy trying to write a brightness filter for an image in a canvas tag. Anyone know of any good tutorials?
[02:17:50] <Kit-10> managed to rectify it
[02:17:59] <faraway> Kit-10: what was it ?
[02:18:04] <Kit-10> even though IE9 was reporting that it had a content-type
[02:18:08] <Kit-10> it didn't
[02:18:23] <faraway> Kit-10: so after setting a content type it worked ?
[02:18:23] * asteig waves to Kit-10
[02:18:24] <Kit-10> i forced one in the php for the page requested, and it magically started to work
[02:18:26] <zapsoda> faraway, i fail at everything :P i tried to put your code ( http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/vCSKe/ ) on my site: ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout
[02:18:27] <Kit-10> hey asteig
[02:18:43] <faraway> Kit-10: that's what i thought
[02:18:53] <Kit-10> i looked at that as my 1st call
[02:19:12] <Kit-10> but was confounded by the header being there in the request data in the console
[02:19:43] <faraway> Kit-10: i never believe in what ie is telling me :D
[02:20:23] <Kit-10> asteig: can you elabourate on what you're after
[02:21:05] <asteig> Kit-!0: I'm basically creating a really simple image editor using HTML5, jQuery, and the canvas tag. I have an image loaded, and can rotate based on a value, but I also need to adjust brightness, contrast, and threshold.
[02:21:31] <asteig> Kit-10: HTML5Rocks had a great resource, but now all their demos fail for a security reason of some kind.
[02:21:34] <faraway> zapsoda: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/veFtX/
[02:22:01] <faraway> zapsoda: should have saied right at the beginning of the head tag
[02:22:19] <zapsoda> oh ok
[02:22:43] <zapsoda> oh i see
[02:22:50] <zapsoda> i thought it said right after </head>
[02:22:56] <zapsoda> i see now that it said
[02:22:59] <zapsoda> <head>
[02:23:10] <zapsoda> Its late and im dumb
[02:23:48] <faraway> zapsoda: and what is also missing is the element that should be hidden and there for should ahve the class "content"
[02:24:34] <zapsoda> can i do <body class="content">? or will that not work?
[02:26:48] <faraway> zapsoda: it should, but then you cannot display a loding info ;)
[02:27:14] <zapsoda> faraway, i seem to get it to half way work http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/ it sets the display to none but it doesnt  switch back to block
[02:28:04] <faraway> zapsoda: the script that should turn it visible does nto run because of "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL "
[02:28:29] <faraway> zapsoda: seems that somethign with your encoding is wrong
[02:30:08] <zapsoda> :/ line 31 of that file is "});‚Äã"
[02:31:18] <faraway> zapsoda: the code is ok, but there are some invisible chars in you code that are illigal, i would guess your mixing up encodings for some reason
[02:32:16] <faraway> try to delete }); </script>  and type it by hand again
[02:33:23] <Luffha> hi guys...any idea on this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11966985/jquery-transforming-image-links-to-a-gallery
[02:33:34] <zapsoda> o.O your a genuis
[02:33:44] <zapsoda> and i cant spell :P
[02:34:08] <faraway> zapsoda: now you need to replace the dummy setTimeout with your own function
[02:35:18] <faraway> zapsoda: and instead only making it visible you can also do a fadeIn or other things, but who to do is up to you ;)
[02:36:08] <zapsoda> Ok, what code am i spouse to put in instead of the setTimeout?
[02:36:21] <zapsoda> oh right now it just loads after 3000 miliseconds?
[02:36:29] <zapsoda> not after its loaded?
[02:37:05] <faraway> zapsoda: exactly
[02:37:40] <zapsoda> Whats the function for done loading? :P
[02:39:00] <faraway> zapsoda:http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[02:39:09] <faraway> zapsoda: probably you find it there ;)
[02:39:14] <zapsoda> Thank you
[02:40:41] <zapsoda> .load() or .ready()          ?
[02:41:31] <radiodario> ready
[02:41:46] <radiodario> $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[02:42:40] <faraway> radiodario: why is since when is load deprecated ?
[02:43:18] <faraway> radiodario: or is just the short cut deprecated ?
[02:43:27] <radiodario> i have no idea, i just always use that one
[02:43:47] <faraway> zapsoda: ready is fired as soon as the dom is ready but that does not mean that all images are loaded
[02:44:00] <radiodario> oh you're talking about images
[02:44:09] <radiodario> sorry i should scroll up lol
[02:44:18] <faraway> radiodario: thought zapsoda was talking about them :D
[02:44:46] <radiodario> so whats the idea, is zapsoda trying to load the images dynamically?
[02:45:03] <faraway> thats why i thought it should be load, but that it is marked as depreacted is a little bit strange,
[02:45:30] <radiodario> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2392410/jquery-loading-images-with-complete-callback
[02:45:41] <zapsoda> im trying to make my page not display intell everything is loaded radiodario
[02:45:59] <radiodario> oh i see
[02:46:08] <radiodario> 'until'
[02:47:35] <radiodario> i don't know if that's a safe design choice, how about you try to make the loading faster?
[02:47:53] <zapsoda> I am going to compress the image also
[02:47:59] <zapsoda> its a huge background image
[02:48:12] <zapsoda> site: ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout
[02:48:33] <radiodario> well tyat's done it for me
[02:49:01] <zapsoda> yep its working now witht he .load() thanks to faraway
[02:49:01] <radiodario> you should make that div's background a bit less transparent
[02:49:09] <zapsoda> which?
[02:49:38] <radiodario> the text
[02:49:58] <radiodario> but yeah cool stuff
[02:50:52] <faraway> zapsoda: yes load works, but i'm still not sure what to use instead cause it is deprecated i think it is only the short cut method that is deprecated and .on("load", ‚Ä¶) is now the preferred way to do
[02:52:02] <faraway> zapsoda: ok seems so ‚Ä¶ so you should sue the .on("load", yourHandler) instead of .load(yourHandler)
[02:52:55] <zapsoda> i wasnt putting anything in the paramaters for the load should i just put "body"?

[03:13:09] <ProblemEmitter> hello, i updated to 1.8.0 and it seems that i cant use the [someattribute="some value"] selector anymore? :(
[03:15:26] <ProblemEmitter> e.g. $('.someclass[somecustomattribute="some value"]') throws: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: :[wname="Eesti tuba"]
[03:15:44] <NodeX> wname?
[03:16:17] <NodeX> that looks like a bad selector
[03:16:28] <ProblemEmitter> its a custom attribute
[03:17:05] <ProblemEmitter> short for windowname, its just something i have on a <div> element and the selector worked perfectly in previous versions
[03:17:28] <NodeX> why dont you use data-*
[03:17:41] <NodeX> that's what it;'s there for and it stops circular memory leaks
[03:18:34] <ProblemEmitter> the selector fails with data-xxx aswell, it seems like it doesnt like double quotes around the value
[03:19:00] <NodeX> try \"
[03:19:28] <ProblemEmitter> sorry, my bad
[03:19:46] <ProblemEmitter> the .someclass[data-whatever='something'] selector works fine
[03:20:14] <NodeX> very weird
[03:20:38] <NodeX> maybe they dropped support for custom attr's due to the data- methods
[03:20:44] <NodeX> check the rls notes
[03:20:48] <ProblemEmitter> sounds realistic
[03:21:15] <sicp> if I have HTML code that makes up a navigation bar and it has 5 or so links..I want to add the touchstart() to them all..
[03:21:18] <sicp> how would I do that?
[03:21:39] <sicp> I mean I need to be working with an element to do that, I've done it with an Image element that I constructed in the jquery file
[03:22:46] <ProblemEmitter> NodeX: never mind, i got it working by using .class[wname=\"some value\"] now
[03:22:49] <sicp> ah! I can grab these HTML elements and assign them to jQuery objects!
[03:23:54] <Raydiation> jquery resizable lets me resize 1 element. what about the element to its right side?

[04:27:34] <Warpten> Any idea on how to make a set of divs of size unknown use slideToggle "recusively"? As in each div has to slide after the previous one in the dom has finished sliding

[04:59:03] <radiodario> Iszak: he means a single quote as an apostrophe
[04:59:12] <radiodario> you'll have to escape it

[05:21:04] <Webervin> it is not about quotes. issue is same if href is inside string since beginnig
[05:21:44] <eni> why isn't this working ? 	$('.playlist_rem').live('click', function(){alert("foo");}); when i click on <a class="playlist_rem" title="Retirer de ma playlist" href="#"/>
[05:22:42] <eni> but it works with .click
[05:22:44] <Webervin>  $('<a href="/ra?a=b&divide_money=both&d=e">test</a>').attr('href')    => /ra?a=b√∑_money=both&d=e
[05:23:05] <Webervin> it works if i rename param from 'divide_' to anything else
[05:23:17] <tompaw> lol I found a bug in jqWidgets :D
[05:25:54] <eni> Ok, so when clicking on something like <a href="" class="playlist_rem">foo</a> and having a script like $('.playlist_rem').click(function(){alert("foo"); }); works!! but having some script with .live("click", function(){.. instead of directly using .click() doesn't work. Is live used with nodes that are added later to the DOM or what?
[05:26:32] <NodeX> live is depreciated
[05:26:34] <NodeX> use on()
[05:26:56] <Yesian> can anyone help me with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11961218/separate-fadetoggle-divs-with-hashchange
[05:28:18] <eni> NodeX, ok thanks
[05:28:58] <ScottG> So I'm using jQuery UI's selected interaction. It's working but I'm wondering if there is a way to manuall trigger a selection on an selectee. What I want to do is set the first row as selected when the page initially loads.
[05:29:59] <rgr> >whats the selector to say select a set of elements of class A whose display css value is block?
[05:31:36] <NodeX> block or visible?
[05:31:47] <eni> NodeX, $(this).parent().clone().appendTo('#user_playlist .toggle_container').prepend(rem); where rem is something like <a class="playlist_rem"></a> but it won't fall for the $('.playlist_rem').on('click', .. any idea?
[05:32:25] <NodeX> $('body').on('click','.playlist_rem',function(){....});
[05:33:12] <eni> why 'body' ?
[05:33:28] <NodeX> because it's in the future
[05:34:11] <jeffsmykil> Hi could someone take a look at this for me?  http://pastebin.com/wAue44es
[05:34:32] <eni> NodeX, well it doesn't work (even the ones that weren't being added like that don't work anymore)
[05:34:53] <NodeX> then there is somehting wrong wiht your code. fiddle or pastebin iut
[05:34:55] <NodeX> it *
[05:35:05] <eni> it's way too much
[05:35:16] <CodesStuff> ?y R.E.M.
[05:35:18] <eni> there's php/js and html together :)
[05:35:18] <bot-t> CodesStuff, Couldn't find "y R.E.M." in jQuery Docs.
[05:35:25] <CodesStuff> d'aw. no youtube
[05:36:26] <NodeX> good luck then ;)
[05:36:42] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: you mind taking a look?
[05:37:04] <eni> NodeX, thanks
[05:38:39] <Birliban> hi, could someone have a look here, problem is written in comments: http://jsfiddle.net/Birliban/GPA7W/1/
[05:44:17] <martisj> Birliban: is it running slowly on your machine?
[05:44:24] <martisj> that seems like a pretty efficient selector to me
[05:44:35] <se1fi> me too
[05:44:41] <martisj> unless you're only looking to target one of img.saveRoute's ?
[05:44:56] <Birliban> martisj, hmm, no ;-) i thougth there was a better way...
[05:45:43] <martisj> Birliban: that's all good then
[05:46:04] <Birliban> ok :) then thanks for that.
[05:46:08] <martisj> don't think too much about optimizing yet, it should only start being an issue when you've got a massive site.
[05:46:09] <Webervin> Thanks all.
[05:46:24] <martisj> Birliban: I also get stuck in the optimization cycle.
[05:46:26] <martisj> it's crap
[05:46:33] <martisj> make it work and then refactor if it's slow
[05:46:41] <martisj> that way you're quicker
[05:46:48] <Birliban> martisj, i have 40 divs with the same code
[05:47:33] <Birliban> ok, thanks for this way of thinking... I always want to use the most elegant way ;-)
[05:47:38] <martisj> it's hard to get in to that mindset when you think like that to begin with. But in worklife you have to be focus on being clean (i.e. readable code) and productive rather than optimized at every level.
[05:47:51] <martisj> Birliban: i know the feeling
[05:47:56] <Birliban> hrhr
[05:48:03] <martisj> 40 divs should be fine, at least if you want to target them all :)
[05:48:54] <Iszak> optimization should be important, but it shouldn't dictate everything. Remember premature optimization is the root of all evil.
[05:49:08] <Birliban> you're right i have never seen any noticeable speed issues in my jquery scripts yet...
[05:51:19] <jeffsmykil> Anyone give me a hand?  Explanation is in the paste:  http://jsfiddle.net/Birliban/GPA7W/1/
[05:52:28] <Birliban> ???
[05:52:32] <martisj> Iszak: that's the key, "premature optimization"
[05:53:08] <martisj> jeffsmykil: that's the wrong paste
[05:53:15] <Birliban> ok ;-)
[05:53:30] <jeffsmykil> lol

[05:57:49] <martisj> jeffsmykil: np
[05:58:12] <martisj> jsfiddle is more awesome
[05:58:28] <jeffsmykil> yeah I know but i didnt have a working snippet so i thought pastebin more appropriate
[06:03:11] <martisj> what error are you getting?
[06:03:15] <jeffsmykil> martisj: any insight?
[06:03:32] <jeffsmykil> that's the problem , I'm not, but with mine im getting quotes around the sorter: false part
[06:03:38] <martisj> my json is pretty crap but headers[num] don't even know what that does.
[06:03:46] <jeffsmykil> it works
[06:03:48] <martisj> quotes ?
[06:04:02] <martisj> make a jsfiddle that way i can see the error
[06:04:03] <martisj> I'mlazy

[06:14:56] <quarkie> Hi, I'm using the jquery form plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/form). On uploading files I receive "CSRF verification failed. Request aborted." Does anyone know if I how I can set the csrf_token to XMLHttpRequests to post requests of that plugin?
[06:15:34] <quarkie> oh my. *Does anyone know how I can set the csrf_token to XMLHttpRequests to post requests of that plugin?*
[06:15:36] <jeffsmykil> im trying to match the formats martisj
[06:15:49] <martisj> jeffsmykil: aha :)
[06:15:52] <martisj> i see now ..
[06:15:55] <martisj> i'll have a look
[06:15:59] <martisj> it's confusing as fuuu
[06:16:03] <jeffsmykil> let me make one change
[06:16:20] <martisj> ok
[06:16:24] <jeffsmykil> try that http://jsfiddle.net/NVWCE/2/
[06:16:35] <jeffsmykil> i know its confusing, that;s why im in here :D
[06:16:43] <martisj> is columnsDisabled meant to be an array from 0 to 3?
[06:16:54] <jeffsmykil> check the second link
[06:16:59] <jeffsmykil> no its just two numbers
[06:17:09] <jeffsmykil> this is to diable table columns from being sorted martisj
[06:17:22] <jeffsmykil> so the numbers are zero indexed column headers
[06:19:52] <jakob____> how to fadeToggle hidden divs on link click here http://jsfiddle.net/fXA4z/

[06:26:03] <jeffsmykil> martisj: indeed
[06:30:11] <martisj> this works: http://jsfiddle.net/NVWCE/3/
[06:30:16] <martisj> but it makes an object again
[06:30:18] <martisj> i don't know
[06:33:12] <jeffsmykil> martisj: perfect, exactly what I wanted, thank you so much
[06:33:25] <martisj> damn son :)
[06:33:30] <martisj> did you see what i changed?
[06:33:39] <martisj> "sorter: " + false
[06:33:44] <martisj> creates a string of sorts
[06:33:50] <jeffsmykil> yeah I see
[06:33:53] <jeffsmykil> it makes sense
[06:33:56] <jeffsmykil> just didn't think of it
[06:33:57] <martisj> jeffsmykil: good stuff :)
[06:34:02] <martisj> happy to help
[06:34:10] <jeffsmykil> i tried it without the braces but it got an error of course

[06:34:26] <martisj> hahahahaa
[06:34:30] <martisj> tyvm ?
[06:36:13] <jeffsmykil> thank you very much ==  tyvm
[06:38:00] <martisj> lolcat stephens
[06:38:03] <martisj> that's great mate
[06:38:15] <martisj> remember in javascript everything is an object
[06:38:20] <martisj> that doesn't even make sense
[06:38:34] <martisj> if that was true then it should have shown you Object instead of the String.
[06:38:58] <martisj> I guess whenever trying to output a String Object javascript uses the ToString method, which makes it readable...
[06:39:07] <martisj> wonder if you can print the object information on a string.
[06:39:21] <martisj> i.e. bypass the toString method and console.log() the String object ..
[06:39:25] <martisj> that's for another time
[06:46:21] <martisj> gnight jeffsmykil
[06:46:26] <martisj> and everybody else
[06:46:28] <martisj> keep it real
[07:08:04] <floogy> Hi is this the apprpriate channel for shaddowbox.js related questions?
[07:08:57] <incimin> hello, i'm trying to toggle the visibility of a paragraph which is in the same div as the toggle button; why is this not working http://jsfiddle.net/BLT39/1/ ?
[07:09:09] <juha_> floogy: if it's a jquery plugin, then sure
[07:09:17] <floogy> I want fit an img element borderless into a div container, which is resized by sghadowbox
[07:10:00] <juha_> floogy: #testLetPar is not the parent of #testLetButton
[07:10:40] <juha_> floogy: sorry, i meant that for incimin
[07:10:42] <juha_> incimin: http://jsfiddle.net/BLT39/2/
[07:10:55] <floogy> ok
[07:11:14] <incimin> juha_: this hides the button, too
[07:11:24] <juha_> floogy: what you should do is upload your problem into jsfiddle and send a link here, someone is sure to check it out
[07:11:37] <juha_> incimin: oh ok, you want the button to stay visible
[07:11:48] <juha_> incimin: then you should use siblings() instead of parent
[07:12:01] <floogy> juha, how does that work? copy and paste from my editor?
[07:12:02] <Brodingo> http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/BLT39/3/
[07:12:17] <incimin> oh, i totally confused selection in parent(selection), sorry
[07:12:36] <juha_> incimin: like so http://jsfiddle.net/BLT39/4/
[07:12:43] <alcuadrado> anyone using jHtmlarea? I need to add it autocomplete, and I'm quite lost about ho
[07:12:44] <alcuadrado> w
[07:13:06] <juha_> floogy: yeah, check the fiddle incimin sent, there's a good example how it works
[07:13:31] <incimin> juha_: thanks for pointing that out! to be clear: selection in parent(selection) is meant to reference what exactly?
[07:14:22] <juha_> incimin: first parent with that selector, you should also check parents() if you need to traverse more
[07:14:51] <incimin> first one,ok
[07:14:53] <incimin> juha_: thanks
[07:15:36] <juha_> incimin: you should read about the differences between parent() and parents() from the docs, doesn't hurt  :P
[07:15:50] <Brodingo> see also closest()
[07:16:28] <Afflicto> using jQuery UI's sortable method -- Is there any neat way to change the items width css property during dragging?
[07:16:38] <benniestacks> Good morning everyone,
[07:16:38] <benniestacks> I am not the best at javascript and have a quick question. Here is (http://puu.sh/Vy26) a piece of code that I have been working on to process payments but I canít figure out how to get anything to display in the console log. I have even did an html button with onclick="WePay.credit_card.create();" but again Iím not sure how the syntax should be. Iím a php developer :-/
[07:17:26] <walidvb> what is the best way to have images to cover a full div? using background-images loses some seo, no?
[07:17:55] <incimin> juha_: do not get me wrong, i did read there first, but it somehow got stuck in my head that parent()'s params are meant to refere to first-level children elements of the parent of $(this)
[07:18:02] <juha_> benniestacks: you should not use inline onclick events
[07:18:15] <Brodingo> walidvb css background-size
[07:18:30] <juha_> benniestacks: $(".your_link").click(function() { console.log("yay"); WePay.credit_car.create(); });
[07:18:55] <walidvb> Brodingo: but isn't background-images bad for seo?
[07:18:56] <juha_> incimin: oh no, you always give a selector you want
[07:19:00] <walidvb> i mean my images are my main content
[07:19:04] <juha_> incimin: not something that's something else :P
[07:19:23] <Brodingo> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[07:19:37] <benniestacks> thanks juha_ I'm giving that a try now
[07:19:46] <walidvb> Brodingo: ?
[07:21:54] <juha_> benniestacks: anytime
[07:22:01] <walidvb> Brodingo: what was that? :D
[07:22:15] <floogy> juha, it must be called by this or a similar URL file:///Z:/_html/rooms_dev5.html?KO=DC&DC=0203_0417_oak_tatra_1S_wild_xll&NO=Dekor&AT=Oak%26nbsp%3BTatra%2C%26nbsp%3Bgemischte%26nbsp%3BVerlegung&FA=ohne%26nbsp%3B&FO=XXL&ST=Landhausdiele
[07:22:24] <Brodingo> (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØo«ùs
[07:22:43] <walidvb> Brodingo: haha
[07:22:47] <walidvb> Brodingo: hm really?
[07:22:56] <floogy> in jsfiddle its a almost empty page
[07:23:22] <juha_> floogy: ok, i have no idea what that is, but usually what people do is they take their broken piece of code (not the whole codebase) and upload it to jsfiddle, then other people can help that person solve the issue
[07:23:29] <floogy> http://jsfiddle.net/HS9w8/
[07:23:38] <walidvb> Brodingo: i'm really bad at SEO, but I wuold really like if you could at least find the images via google images when typing the site name and image name or so...
[07:24:10] <mazzachre> How can I check how much time my scripts are taking to execute? Is there some tool for that?
[07:24:13] <walidvb> i don't think SE take bck-img into account
[07:24:18] <floogy> juha, ok, so it's my fault, I'm really bad at this time coding js
[07:24:37] <juha_> floogy: np
[07:24:42] <walidvb> mazzachre: firebug, i think? and native on webkits
[07:24:42] <faraway> does anyone know a priority queue based loader for scripts, json request and images
[07:25:04] <mazzachre> walidvb: Uhmm how to enable profiling in firebug? I can't seem to find a way?
[07:25:13] <floogy> Due to my lack of understanding basics concepts, it would be hard for me to snip out particular takes from that code. I'll try, though
[07:25:16] <juha_> floogy: also uploading only the broken part will usually help people to see the issue by their selfs as you have to break the code into pieces
[07:25:40] <walidvb> mazzachre: i don't know exactly, sorry, but i'm pretty sure there is a tool enabled by default. profiler or smth
[07:26:20] <walidvb> Brodingo: so that's your answer? (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØo«ùs ?
[07:26:28] <faraway> ideally where request that are in the queue can be aborded
[07:26:48] <faraway> abroted
[07:26:51] <Brodingo> yeah pretty much
[07:27:20] <Brodingo> just get some ad words if you really carte
[07:27:26] <benniestacks> thanks again juha_ I'm not getting yay but am also getting this http://puu.sh/VydX
[07:29:17] <elephphant> Is there a JS tracing tool which will log all the functions called  ?
[07:29:31] <juha_> benniestacks: you should upload core snippet so we can have a look
[07:29:34] <jakob____> is it posible to add something like__ on link click fadeToggle div__ in this code: http://jsfiddle.net/fXA4z/
[07:30:37] <benniestacks> juha_ haha im not even sure how to do that. Is that somthing I do in jsfiddle?
[07:30:44] <juha_> jakob____: use toggleClass instead of this that[ that.attr( 'href' ) === hash ? 'addClass' : 'removeClass' ]( 'selected' );
[07:30:48] <juha_> :P
[07:30:54] <juha_> benniestacks: yeah, it's awesome
[07:30:57] <ravenz> walidvb if it has to be a background, go for a background-image. Otherwise: parent img { width: 100%; height: 100% }
[07:31:22] <mazzachre> walidvb: Found it! Thanks
[07:31:28] <benniestacks> juha_ ok let me get it setup and I'll sent it right over.
[07:32:08] <walidvb> mazzachre: cheers
[07:32:19] <faraway> elephphant: to test on your pc what is called ?
[07:32:30] <alcuadrado> any idea how can I focus via javascript a jquery ui autocomplete ?
[07:32:43] <walidvb> ravenz: i'm using drupal, which themes the img with a width and height attr(overrideable, trying to avoid doing this), and why *parent* img?
[07:33:39] <floogy> shadowbox and lightbox are comin with popup animations (growing boxes that shows the images) I think they work with something like animate. I want now create a html content instead of a simple  image , and fit the image borderless into that shadowbox div (sb-wrapper, sb-inner-wrapper) and put another div layer with a info box or download button on the right bottom.
[07:33:48] <Yesian> juha_: not exactly sure how to do that. will hashchange function work with that?
[07:34:27] <walidvb> and to load smaller versions of the images(for mobile devices for example), i need to load the imgs dynamically, right?
[07:34:58] <Yesian> juha_: second comp :) its jakob___
[07:35:05] <elephphant> faraway :  I have a box fade in twice, and i cant figure out why. So id like to be able to track what JS dfunctions call on a page
[07:35:12] <floogy> Now I need a method to access css in <div id="sb-wrapper-inner" style="height: 424px;"> which is dynamically resized by shaddoebox.
[07:35:22] <walidvb> ravenz: why parent?
[07:35:30] <faraway> elephphant: what browser do you use ?
[07:35:34] <elephphant> All
[07:35:40] <floogy> to set the img width. but it's null
[07:35:42] <elephphant> you name it, i have it lol
[07:35:50] <elephphant> except text ones ;)
[07:37:05] <floogy> var current_height = document.getElementById("sb-wrapper").style.width gets null
[07:37:07] <faraway> elephphant: hehe webkit based browsers hab the developer tolls intalled where you could set break points in your script and there you see exactly the calling stack , for opera you can install firefly, and firefox has the firbug extension.
[07:37:20] <elephphant> I have all those
[07:37:25] <elephphant> still cant track it down
[07:37:35] <faraway> elephphant: did you try it with break points in the script ?
[07:38:13] <elephphant> yeah but it goes through JQuery so its a pain
[07:39:08] <floogy> So I try to grab the element when it is not yet created. But I don't know how to achieve that. Maybe there is a simple method by access the css values with shadowbox itself?
[07:39:46] <ravenz> walidvb so it won't affect all the images in the page
[07:39:51] <faraway> elephphant: there is no way around, and the "call stack" doesn't help you there you see "call path" that happened to call the fade
[07:39:59] <shmup> with .load, can i set async false?
[07:40:00] <faraway> elephphant: ?
[07:40:20] <walidvb> ravenz: lol obviously. sry. but I do need to remove the width and height attribute, then, right?
[07:41:16] <ravenz> the tag ones?
[07:41:37] <walidvb> ravenz: is background image bad for SEO? i am trying to make a fullscreen background, made out of nested slideshows act.
[07:41:51] <walidvb> ravenz: yes the tag ones, not the style="" ones
[07:42:16] <ravenz> inline style (both the old style width="" and style="") is bad
[07:42:20] <ravenz> you should avoid it
[07:42:22] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I would like to clone a select list ("add new item" button) and then reset the value to 0.  I've tried  $('#location-clone').clone().val(0).insertAfter('#location-clone'); without success, any ideas?
[07:42:33] <walidvb> ravenz: background-image would make it easy for cropping and centering and so
[07:42:47] <alicefreak> how do i submit the form? I am trying like this (http://dpaste.org/JGnFw/) am i missing something? thanks
[07:42:52] <walidvb> ravenz: inline-style imgs are given by drupal
[07:42:55] <sente> speaking of SEO, is one much better of (imagine a blog about programming) having actual code examples on the page, *opposed to* embedding gist's from gisthub?
[07:43:05] <gabriel1> is it possible to count how many rows of text I have written in any element?
[07:43:07] <ravenz> walidvb usually I don't give a sh1t if the background of the website is not indexed from search engines
[07:43:30] <walidvb> ravenz: well here it's an architecture office who wants ppl to navigate through projects
[07:43:39] <benniestacks> Hello everyone. For some reason I cant get this script to print out properlly to the console log. I mainly need it to feed shoot back the credit_card_id http://jsfiddle.net/netswagger/8vvfC/
[07:43:50] <walidvb> up/down:project left/right:images
[07:44:00] <ravenz> walidvb ah you are that guy
[07:44:06] <walidvb> ravenz: that's me :)
[07:44:18] <walidvb> solved it the way i first thought, btw. nested cycles
[07:44:18] <ravenz> eh you got images galleries
[07:44:38] <ravenz> not backgrounds
[07:44:40] <walidvb> i got it all working, just working on the css and sizes and so.
[07:45:52] <walidvb> ravenz: exactly. meaning(btw). that replacing links by images on load is also not gonna work with SEO, actually. if the images aren't <img>, right?
[07:45:55] <ravenz> just go with parent img { max-width: 100% } then
[07:46:10] <ravenz> you want the image to fit the screen width
[07:46:26] <walidvb> hm yes. or the parent div width, to be exact
[07:46:40] <walidvb> parent div is 99%
[07:46:50] <walidvb> but I need to be careful with ratio, as well.
[07:47:12] <ravenz> eh
[07:47:43] <walidvb> that's why background-image would make everything very easy.
[07:48:03] <walidvb> but both solutions have this: replacing links by images on load is also not gonna work with SEO, actually. if the images aren't <img>
[07:48:44] <ravenz> you are going to have a problem there, if the image's height is more than the window height ..you need to unbind the key up/down
[07:49:01] <ravenz> so the user can scroll the page with a keyboard
[07:49:13] <walidvb> or lock the window's height?
[07:49:26] <ravenz> that would crop the image
[07:49:29] <walidvb> or crop the image.
[07:50:04] <ravenz> anyway with max-width: 100% the image will maintain the ratio
[07:50:19] <walidvb> locking the window's size wouldn't. it would only be extremely annoying :P
[07:50:58] <walidvb> ravenz: that's true. and why not scroll?
[07:51:11] <walidvb> what about the SEO? should I not have somewhere in my DOM my <img>?
[07:52:12] <ravenz> well I think that crawlers follow the links so your image will be indexed, anyway I am not 100% sure of that
[07:52:19] <ravenz> you can ask #seo
[07:53:26] <ravenz> I gotta go, bye

[07:55:30] <shoky> derp
[07:57:14] <benniestacks> Anyone, any idea why I'm getting this error in the console log http://jsfiddle.net/netswagger/8vvfC/
[07:59:22] <shoky> benniestacks: credit_card ?
[08:00:17] <benniestacks> shoky yea its a payment api for wepay and am trying to get credit_card_id
[08:00:28] <shoky> benniestacks: i meant, credit_card, not credit_car
[08:02:14] <shoky> benniestacks: anyway after fixing that it complains cause you're not passing anything to create(), i guess
[08:03:17] <benniestacks> shoky: yea it's weird, becasue the perams are in the WePay.credit_card.create
[08:03:27] <shoky> benniestacks: no they're not..
[08:03:36] <shoky> benniestacks: you had:  WePay.credit_car.create();
[08:03:40] <shoky> in your click handler..
[08:03:51] <shoky> you're not passing anything to it
[08:03:59] <benniestacks> ooooh i see
[08:04:01] <shoky> and it's trying to get the client_id from what you passed to it
[08:10:42] <benniestacks> shoky, am I way off with this http://jsfiddle.net/netswagger/8vvfC/1/ ?
[08:10:59] <benniestacks> I'm still getting that client_id
[08:15:05] <christo_m> Hi, im trying to force a second UI dialog box to stack over the first, ive missed wiht both the "stack" option and "zIndex" and also the actual z-index of the div im applying the dialog to
[08:15:19] <christo_m> so i open th efirst dialog, then click a button in said dialog and it opens another dialog but it always appears underneath
[08:19:48] <radiodario> christo_m: why don't you close (hide) the first one
[08:19:54] <radiodario> i.e apply display:none to the first one?
[08:20:00] <christo_m> i need it still
[08:20:04] <radiodario> and then when you close the second one you remove it
[08:20:11] <christo_m> ah
[08:20:11] <christo_m> ok
[08:20:20] <radiodario> you can also choose the x/y of the dialog
[08:20:31] <radiodario> or don't make it modal so you can move it around
[08:20:48] <radiodario> choices! choices! chooooices!
[08:20:51] * radiodario passes out
[08:23:36] <shoky> benniestacks: you're still calling create without passing anything: var response = WePay.credit_card.create( );
[08:24:12] <shoky> benniestacks: but now your click handler is ok.
[08:25:52] <benniestacks> Thanks shoky, so i've removed that. I'm just not sure how to get the other console log to display
[08:26:17] <shoky> benniestacks: what other console log
[08:26:49] <benniestacks> console.log(data);
[08:26:49] <benniestacks>             // handle success (probably you will submit the form with the credit_card_id)
[08:26:55] <shoky> benniestacks: oh i thougth the 'yay' was coming from that, heh
[08:27:10] <shoky> benniestacks: well i cant help you there, that'd depend on the WePay API..
[08:27:34] <benniestacks> oh ok, thanks so much for your hel shoky
[08:28:06] <shoky> np
[08:30:39] <vsmith> Hello all
[08:31:27] <vsmith> I am looking for  a few UI Rockstar designers for a project.  Any in here interested message me for more details
[08:31:45] <Kevel> hi
[08:32:01] <Kevel> trying to select a form that is of 1 class, and doesnt have 1 class
[08:32:39] <Kevel> $(".transaction-create-form: not(.hidden)")
[08:33:02] <shoky> Kevel: delete that space in the middle and it should work
[08:33:10] <Kevel> this should return all items that have transaction-create-form class BUT NOT THE ONES THAT HAVE .hidden applied to them
[08:33:14] <Kevel> ok
[08:33:32] <Kevel> holy shit i was correct this whole time
[08:33:38] <Kevel> didnt know it was sensitive to spaces
[08:33:39] <Kevel> :p
[08:33:40] <Kevel> thanks shoky
[08:33:51] <shoky> Kevel: it's ":not",  not  ": not"  :)
[08:34:13] <shoky> and selectors are very sensitive to spaces, yes
[08:35:26] <Kevel> shoky: i have my form element, now i wish to get the set values that belong to the form
[08:35:31] <alicefreak> how do i submit the form using jquery? I am trying like this (http://dpaste.org/JGnFw/) am i missing something? thanks
[08:35:38] <Kevel> lets assume that var formEl = $(".transaction-create-form input:button")
[08:35:58] <Kevel> are there specific form functions in jquery to strip out all the values?
[08:36:01] <shoky> only the buttons?
[08:36:18] <shoky> what do you mean strip out all the values?
[08:36:35] <shoky> you might want .serialize() ? i dunno
[08:36:38] <Kevel> I mean, i want to take all the values out of textarea's and number inputs
[08:36:50] <shoky> "take" ?
[08:36:56] <Kevel> =(
[08:37:02] <Kevel> pastebin time
[08:37:02] <shoky> and do what with them
[08:37:40] <Kevel> http://paste2.org/p/2121517
[08:37:58] <Kevel> im going to submit them using ajax, but first i need to get the values that a user types in
[08:38:14] <shoky> you probably want .serialize() then
[08:38:20] <shoky> on the form element
[08:38:31] <shoky> (or on the specific inputs that you want to serialize)
[08:38:41] <Kevel> formEl.serialize() ?
[08:38:50] <shoky> yes
[08:39:16] <shoky> ?serialize
[08:39:17] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:39:20] <Kevel> shoky: thanks :)
[08:45:02] <Bheam> is there any way to tell all fades to instantly finish?
[08:45:31] <Brodingo> ?stop
[08:45:31] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[08:46:00] <Brodingo> .stop(true, true)
[08:59:32] <rabbi1> how to find the if the div has a class of something in uitabs show: function ?
[09:05:15] <Kevel> shoky: is there a quick way to reset a form?
[09:05:27] <Kevel> example: formEl.reset()
[09:05:28] <Kevel> or something?
[09:05:54] <rich97> Hey has anyone has any problems getting $('#upload').trigger('click'); to work in IE8 where $('#upload') is a submit, input element.
[09:06:04] <rich97> ?*

[09:08:34] <rabbi1> got it, hasClass()
[09:10:22] <ogk1000> is there something similar to jQuery(window).resize(function() {   });  for when a window is docked to a position?
[09:10:41] <ogk1000> for some reason the resize function is not "listening" when I go from smaller window to docking it to the top/full screen
[09:10:59] <ogk1000> or maximize function?
[09:13:05] <faraway> Kevel: $("form")[0].reset();
[09:15:36] <subdesign> any idea i dont see section tag content in IE8 even using html5shiv and display:block trick
[09:15:37] <subdesign> ?
[09:16:22] <faraway> subdesign: do you create section with jQuery or is it in the html ?
[09:16:29] <subdesign> simply html
[09:16:57] <subdesign> ok i can replace with div but i want to solve finally
[09:17:28] <faraway> hmm .. i used alway modernizr and had never the problem
[09:17:37] <ryanneufeld> ?botsnack
[09:17:38] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[09:18:43] <subdesign> i had modernizr too before
[09:19:22] <ogk1000> can anyone help me, when I maximize a window my .resize doesnt listen.. only on manual resize, any ideas?
[09:20:37] <faraway> subdesign: what doc type do you use (i really don't know if this could be a problem)
[09:24:20] <subdesign> html5
[09:24:25] <faraway> ogk1000: do you listen to window or document
[09:24:32] <ogk1000> window
[09:24:52] <ogk1000> jQuery(window).bind('resize',function() {
[09:25:26] <ogk1000> tried both, needs window
[09:25:30] <ogk1000> I can send you URL if you dont mind taking al ook
[09:25:36] <Bheam> i have the same question as here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10689200/ie-keeps-resetting-scrollleft-after-animation
[09:25:41] <Bheam> any ideas how to circumvent?
[09:26:19] <ogk1000> Bheam, maybe grab current pos and set it with css
[09:27:23] <Bheam> oncomplete?
[09:27:38] <ogk1000> onmouseleave ( get top pos of the element and then set it with css
[09:27:46] <faraway> ogk1000: do oyu know which browser it is ?
[09:27:53] <ogk1000> faraway, for me all
[09:28:09] <Progster> is there a javascript or jquery library for creating a wizard that is widely used? or is this something usually coded up by ?hand?
[09:28:14] <ogk1000> 		if(winwidth >= 1600){			
[09:28:14] <ogk1000> 			$('#homess img').attr('height', 'auto');
[09:28:14] <ogk1000> 		} else {
[09:28:14] <ogk1000> 			$('#homess img').css({'width':'1600px', 'height':'auto'});
[09:28:14] <ogk1000> 		}
[09:28:18] <ogk1000> oops sorry
[09:28:22] <faraway> ogk1000: strange i had in mind that there was a problem with some browsers
[09:28:46] <ogk1000> is there a way to add !important
[09:28:47] <faraway> ogk1000: sorry have to go to a meeting ‚Ä¶ good luck
[09:28:50] <jackyyll> How would i go about selecting all input's that AREN'T a child to a certain form?
[09:29:00] <ogk1000> $('#homess img').css({'width': winwidth +'!important', 'height':'auto'});
[09:29:53] <smithbh> ogk1000 did you get it?
[09:29:56] <smithbh> $(window).resize(function(){
[09:29:56] <smithbh>   var doc_height = $(window).height();
[09:29:58] <smithbh>   var doc_width = $(window).width();
[09:29:58] <smithbh> });
[09:30:21] <ogk1000> smithbh, its working fine on resize the prob is when I maximize from small
[09:30:36] <Bheam> ogk1000: not sure what you're on about :p don't think scroll can be set with css?
[09:33:05] <ogk1000> smithbh, this is my code http://collabedit.com/s7jkj
[09:33:14] <Atty> finally lol I was typing /j $jquery lol

[09:40:05] <jita_> Is there a way to include the disabled textarea's value in jquery form.serialize() ?
[09:40:23] <NoiseEee> jita_: use 'readonly' instead of disabled
[09:42:04] <Somatt> it seems append is behaving weirdly in ie7/8. Any idea how to handle things for this crappy thing to work ?
[09:42:08] <loincloth> i'm waiting for dom ready, but $('#myElement').width() is returning the window width for some brief period.. why is that and/or how can i work around it?
[09:42:19] <loincloth> i'm setting a timeout now, but that isn't a very robust solution, not to mention bad UX
[09:42:50] <NoiseEee> Somatt: pass "actWeird: false"
[09:43:29] <Somatt> NoiseEee: I think I'm gonna go with bomb microsoft instead :p
[09:43:35] <NoiseEee> i.e: "behaving weirdly" could use a definition/context/code sample etc
[09:44:52] <Somatt> NoiseEee: if I knew the exact nature of the problem, I'd have my workaround alreay
[09:45:14] <Somatt> I just know it doesn't play well with append/appendTo/html so far
[09:45:27] <Somatt> parts are added to the dom, others aren't
[09:45:59] <jita_> NoiseEee, Thanks
[09:46:02] <Bheam> hmm i found the error.. it wasn't with animate. it seems when i fadeout() another element, and ie does repositioning after the fadeout, it resets scrolls
[09:46:20] <pandemic> ls -la
[09:46:37] <pandemic> oops, ignore me!
[09:46:42] <pandemic> still early :-P
[09:48:50] <ogk1000> thanks anyway for help brandon

[10:09:44] <Atty> I have some Jquery that I use for weekcalendar.js and Id like to make it work with fullcalendar.js can anyone help me with this?
[10:12:24] <pandemic> alicefreak: your Submit button never submits the form
[10:12:46] <pandemic> alicefreak: try this http://jsfiddle.net/j9Kk6/
[10:13:57] <Croves> Hey guys, can anyone help me here? I wanna use the Twitter Bootstrap Tooltip Plugin (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tooltips)
[10:14:22] <Croves> I've inserted the .JS file in my code (with jQUery file also), but the tooltip doesn't show...
[10:14:45] <Croves> My HTML is here: pastebin.com/wPhBc3Tv
[10:16:53] <angrywombat> assuming i have a select drop down in the format <option val="0">whatever</option>, is there an easy way in jquery to compare the name/label of the option (whatever in this case) to a list?
[10:17:25] <angrywombat> what i am trying to do is set the selected option based on the text of the option, not the value
[10:19:52] <Atty> I want to make this code which was designed for weekcalendar.js to work with fullcalendar.js any help would be great. http://pastie.org/4494753

[10:47:41] <andrewhl> I have the following jquery: http://pastie.org/4494874. All it does is cause a div to fadeIn and fadeOut on hover. Problem is, if you hover repeatedly over an element (in and out quickly), it stacks the hover events, so they keep happening. How can I cause it to only trigger the hover function when the last hover function is finished?
[10:47:59] <saml> hey given a form, how can I get an input with name="foo" ?
[10:48:11] <saml> $(form).find("name=foo") ?
[10:48:21] <andrewhl> saml: $('form input[name="foo"]')
[10:48:36] <andrewhl> look up css attribute selectors
[10:49:39] <Atty> I want to make this code which was designed for weekcalendar.js to work with fullcalendar.js any help would be great. http://pastie.org/4494753
[10:50:04] <saml> oh i see. i was doing  $(this).find('input[name="foo"]')   inside success of ajax
[10:50:07] <synth3tk> hi, is there a plugin where i can have a few thumbnails rotate endlessly? i can't seem to find the right keywords when googling. http://synth3.tk/images/ext/rotate.png
[10:50:14] <saml> this binds to ajax event, not to form
[10:50:56] <synth3tk> sort of like a slider, but all the ones i see use thumbnails as a controlnav, not as the slider themselves
[10:51:19] <LoneStar99> can't log into #php --> there is a site like jsfiddle but can be used with php something like code viper ...
[10:51:28] <saml> given jqInput  ($('form input[....]'))  how can I get the form element?
[10:52:42] <saml> $('#label_name').parents('form')   ?
[10:52:49] <pandemic> saml: well maybe $(this).parent('form') ?
[10:53:06] <pandemic> haha yeah, something like that
[10:53:08] <Kevel> I need to select something that has 2 classes
[10:53:09] <saml> .parent('form') returns []  because form is not immediate parent
[10:53:11] <Kevel> how would i do it?
[10:53:16] <Kevel> current_post = $(".transaction-create-form.transaction-create-active:not(.hidden)]"),
[10:53:18] <pandemic> ah, one sec
[10:53:22] <Kevel> thats what im doing
[10:53:23] <Kevel> :<
[10:53:27] <Kevel> she no work!
[10:53:44] <saml> .closeted()
[10:53:59] <Kevel> saml: elaborate please?
[10:54:00] <LoneStar99> http://codepad.viper-7.com/
[10:54:26] <synth3tk> oh, and a bonus would be if this could be responsive, too
[10:56:37] <Progster> What's the best javascript environment you can think of to quickly create snippets, test and debug? jsfiddle?
[10:58:02] <synth3tk> Progster: jsfiddle is what i use
[10:58:10] <NoiseEee> for the most part.   jsbin.com too
[10:58:10] <pandemic> saml: parents does indeed seem to work
[10:58:30] <pandemic> saml: http://jsfiddle.net/SgsUy/
[10:58:41] <pandemic> but you were right, parent doesn't work

[11:00:52] <Bryce> Hello, I'm trying to figure out how to call a function from a string across linked windows instances.  I've prepared some rough code to get my question across.
[11:00:52] <Bryce> http://pastebin.com/TuA6wf9D
[11:00:57] <Bryce> Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[11:05:28] <w00tner> Hello
[11:05:34] <pandemic> Bryce: http://jsfiddle.net/yJE6q/
[11:05:39] <pandemic> does that help?
[11:06:17] <pandemic> basically in your source it looked like you were trying to execute a string like a function
[11:06:18] <pandemic> '
[11:06:22] <w00tner> is it possible to list a json file by categories with JQuery ?
[11:06:38] <saml> jqInput.closest('form').find('input[name="label"]').val(data["tagId"]);
[11:07:06] <synth3tk> is there a plugin where i can have a few thumbnails rotate endlessly? i can't seem to find the right keywords when googling. http://synth3.tk/images/ext/rotate.png
[11:07:36] <pandemic> w00tner: can you elaborate?
[11:08:04] <pandemic> synth3tk: like this? http://nivo.dev7studios.com/#usage
[11:08:33] <pandemic> you can configure it to do what you want I beleive
[11:08:39] <pandemic> *believe
[11:10:05] <synth3tk> pandemic: i'll have to look into it. but it seems off the bat that it's made for a different situation. i'm not sure it'll be able to "scroll" through multiple images like i'm trying to do.
[11:10:14] <synth3tk> i'll give it a shot if i can't find anything soon, though
[11:10:31] <w00tner> I have this 'cupones.json' file (http://cuponaria.com/json/cupones.json). Im trying to list the objects using jq's each() .  My question is: if i create more objects in the json file, can i list just certain objects depending of "category" attribute?
[11:10:49] <pandemic> synth3tk: possibly, but you might be able to hack it to suit your needs
[11:11:26] <pandemic> w00tner: look into underscore.js
[11:11:52] <pandemic> w00tner: you'll probably get better utilities for manipulating objects/arrays with it
[11:12:13] <w00tner> this is for a mobile app using jquery mobile
[11:12:25] <pandemic> you can still use underscore :)
[11:13:14] <w00tner> Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you would expect in Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in JavaScript objects. It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux, and Backbone.js's suspenders.     ???
[11:13:20] <w00tner> this ?
[11:13:26] <pandemic> yep
[11:13:32] <pandemic> http://underscorejs.org/#filter
[11:13:39] <pandemic> check that method
[11:15:38] <jita_> Does the before return the element it inserted ?
[11:15:54] <synth3tk> pandemic: i've pretty much found what i wanted. thanks! http://www.egrappler.com/jquery-contentthumbnail-slder-v2-0-jscarousel-v2-0/
[11:15:56] <lathan> jita_, no
[11:16:20] <pandemic> synth3tk: perfect :) no hacking necessary
[11:16:25] <lathan> jita_, if you want that then you do something like: $('new_element_html').insertBefore('selector or stored jQuery object')
[11:16:37] <synth3tk> yup! i found a few more like it, too. time to get cracking, lol.
[11:16:57] <pandemic> nice :)
[11:17:55] <w00tner> dance   _o/    \o/      \o_
[11:18:07] <pandemic> that work for you? :)
[11:18:12] <jita_> lancealtar, i want to edit abbr node just inserted using this http://dpaste.org/35Hne/ ?
[11:18:19] <w00tner> not yet
[11:18:24] <w00tner> im reading the docs
[11:18:30] <pandemic> ah ok
[11:19:43] <Progster> is there a way to tell which jquery/javascript plugins are more popular/in use than others?
[11:20:10] <w00tner> no need to download the dev version ?
[11:20:15] <lathan> Progster, I would google: "javascript library popularity"
[11:20:15] <w00tner> just the 4kb file
[11:20:33] <pandemic> w00tner: just get the production version unless you plan on modifying it
[11:22:12] <Progster> lathan: there are just so many libs out there, hard to know which ones are more mature than others
[11:22:26] <lathan> it is
[11:22:36] <lathan> Progster, if you find it on jQuery's list of plugins its probably better
[11:22:59] <Progster> http://plugins.jquery.com/ is in development
[11:23:02] <lathan> of course...plugins.jquery.com is offline
[11:23:04] <lathan> yah
[11:23:08] * Progster faceplams
[11:23:11] <w00tner> i just want to get the objects listed
[11:23:15] * Progster facepalms for having spelled it 'faceplams'
[11:23:22] <lathan> Progster, are you asking in general, or with a specific plugin in mind now?
[11:23:26] * lathan agrees
[11:23:27] <Progster> wizard plugin
[11:23:45] <pandemic> w00tner: yeah, you would use the filter method to filter out the objects that match the category
[11:23:54] <Progster> just want a simple wizard, nothing too fancy, can do basic ajax calls to rails underneath. May stuff it in a lightbox at some point
[11:24:28] <w00tner> ok i would like to understand it better using the each
[11:24:33] <w00tner> to list all the objects
[11:24:38] <pandemic> one sec, i'll make an example
[11:24:40] <w00tner> _.each([1, 2, 3], function(num){ alert(num); });
[11:24:41] <Progster> so for the one that 'seems' like its being actively developed and is relevant is jQuery-Smart-Wizard
[11:24:58] <w00tner> that would be great, im alittle confused with this
[11:25:35] <lathan> Progster, well I can't tell you which to choose....
[11:25:40] <lathan> your guess is as good as mine
[11:26:03] <lathan> either smart wizard or the formwizard at: archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/formwizard
[11:26:05] <Progster> fair enough
[11:26:17] <lathan> or thecodemine.org
[11:26:22] <Progster> is there a way to upload local stylesheets/javascripts to jsfiddle (add resource?)
[11:26:37] <lathan> Progster, you can point them at localhost, but then it doesn't work for others
[11:27:16] <Progster> no such thing as a good local editor?
[11:28:38] <lathan> idk Progster out of my alley....I run a linux computer with a web server on it...
[11:28:46] <lathan> I edit stuff with command line tools...
[11:29:20] <Bryce> Ok I had a second question.  Has to do with executing function across windows within the context of an existing object.
[11:29:21] <Bryce> http://jsfiddle.net/aAF84/
[11:31:30] <lathan> Bryce, what seems to be the problem
[11:32:15] <lathan> oh....the this context isn't getting passed through?
[11:33:53] <lathan> Bryce, you are falling victim to the problem that your context "this" changes everytime you call a new function
[11:34:59] <Bryce> I guess i'm struggling to grasp how the context would be passed.  Both windows have the same object and both the objects will be already created.  They will have different data.  Do I pass the context in with the trigger? If so, how?
[11:35:25] <lathan> Bryce, just pass your self through the trigger as data
[11:35:42] <lathan> working on the example
[11:37:00] <lathan> Bryce, I have it working with passing "this" through the trigger as event data
[11:37:08] <lathan> Bryce, I will try for a few minutes to actually change the context
[11:37:34] <Bryce> Ok, I appreciate your help.
[11:37:56] <alcuadrado> does anyone know a WYSIWYG editor that supports autocomplete (jquery UI's one preferable)?
[11:39:43] <dgs_> i'm having issues attaching an ajaxStart/ajaxComplete event handler to multiple forms. https://gist.github.com/d44774b443650ba971b2  - i want to add/remove a class to the currently submitted form. On the first submission it seems to add the class to *all* forms on the page, and then subsequent times to only the first form on the page - but never to just the current form‚Ä¶.
[11:39:46] <dgs_> https://gist.github.com/d44774b443650ba971b2
[11:40:19] <lathan> Bryce, I don't think it is fundamentally possible
[11:40:42] <lathan> Bryce, "this" in the new window gets its context from what you trigger the event on. and you did it on the window body
[11:41:28] <lathan> Bryce, are you wanting to communicate with the original object? or the new window's object?
[11:41:42] <Bryce> communicate with the new window's object
[11:42:00] <Bryce> so the parent window does some logic and then triggers an event in the child window.
[11:43:16] <Bryce> I'm trying to setup duplicated UIs to sychonize across window sessions.  So when a change is made in one session it can send the change to all the other sessions.  I have the majority of the logic down, just stuck on giving the callback context.
[11:49:10] <lathan> Bryce
[11:49:20] <lathan> I have 2 versions you want in here: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/eTaJT/6/
[11:49:46] <lathan> 1 has it working with jQuery trigger, with the child object as this, and the parent object passed through as data.
[11:50:19] <lathan> the comented line below the trigger line shows that you don't need to use jQuery triggers, since you could just call the win.window.o.callBack
[11:50:25] <lathan> Bryce, you got that?
[11:52:38] <jita_> Is there a way to know that the child window has been closed and to take an action on the parent window (redirect to the different location) ?
[11:53:32] <lathan> jita, I know if you save the window object, you can check win.closed
[11:53:41] <lathan> jita, what I'm not sure about is if there is an event that will fire
[11:53:51] <w00nzs> Can anyone tell me whats wrong with this json file syntax ? http://cuponaria.com/json/cupones.json
[11:53:53] <RandalSchwartz> looks like there's a window.onclose event
[11:54:18] <RandalSchwartz> so $('the window').on('close', function { ... });
[11:54:51] <Bryce> lathan, i'm looking through it now
[11:55:08] <lathan> I put comments by all the changes...only 2 or 3
[11:55:17] <lathan> jita, did you see RandalSchwartz's answer?
[11:58:07] <jita> lathan, RandalSchwartz, all i can find is this http://api.jquery.com/unload/
[11:58:56] <lathan> jita, okay...it looks like the onclose handler is not terribly compatable
[11:59:18] <lathan> jita, try onunload and check win.closed (or a setTimeout of a few ms)
[12:00:21] <w00nzs> Is this correct if im trying to list a data array of a json object witj jquery ?   ' + data.[0].descripcion + '
[12:00:28] <w00nzs> for the first item
[12:00:40] <lathan> w00nzs, data[0]
[12:00:49] <lathan> you don't use the period and the brackets at the same time
[12:00:54] <lathan> brackets are for arrays
[12:00:59] <lathan> periods are for objects
[12:01:32] <w00nzs> ok thanks =)
[12:02:36] <jita> is there a way to know for how long the window has been opened by the user ?
[12:03:47] <lathan> jita, you could have a setInterval counting on the new page
[12:05:05] <jita> ok thanks
[12:05:50] <w00nzs> Im retrieving the json file correcty but i cannot use the objects
[12:05:51] <w00nzs> var cuponHeader = $('<div align="center"><h1>' + data[0].titulo + '</h1><h2>' + data[0].empresa + '</h2></div>');
[12:06:25] <w00nzs> this is my json file: http://cuponaria.com/json/cupones.json
[12:09:51] <CodesStuff> w00nzs: run it through JSON.parse just to be safe
[12:09:55] <CodesStuff> then try accessing it
[12:11:01] <w00nzs> SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,
[12:11:02] <w00nzs> yeah
[12:11:53] <lathan> w00nzs, look for a comma right before a ] or }
[12:11:58] <lathan> extra commas kill you sometimes
[12:12:40] <artiswilliams> I'm looking for a jquery plugin that where I can display a grid of small thumbnails where when you click/hover the full image will load exactly over the entire grid.  I've been looking for a while now‚Ä¶anyone have any ideas?
[12:13:11] <w00nzs> SyntaxError: Unexpected token { aggggghhhhhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[12:13:59] <w00nzs> the correct way to access the file is using  data.titulo[0]  ???
[12:14:04] <w00nzs> the correct way to access the file is using  data.titulo[1]  ???
[12:14:12] <w00nzs> or am i wrong
[12:16:46] <w00nzs> it work if i only have one element... it reads great using    " data.title " for ex
[12:17:11] <w00nzs> but as soon i add another json element and try to access " data.title[0] " FAIL
[12:17:13] <TelFiRE> hi! Anyone know of a plugin or method/tutorial that will allow me to have mobile navigation like facebook or sony? IE, I want it to show a ul's immediate child lis, and when clicked show that li's child ul's immediate lis, etc. So nested navigation, if I tap "Parks" I see North, South, West etc... I tap North and I see the full list of Northern parks, sorry if I'm not explaining this well but hopefully you know what I mean :P
[12:21:34] <MaxymiserTE> What is the best way to keep a certain query string active across a site even when someone bookmarks the page, if the admin wants to update the query string parameters  it should redirect all links including the "expired" query strings in someone's bookmarks. Is that possible?
[12:22:12] <MaxymiserTE> For example: ?sort=A-Z&order=ASC is on the link, and the admin wants to change the default experience to ?sort-Z-A&order=DESC
[12:22:55] <ezakimak> w00nzs, you don't have a comma between the two {}'s
[12:23:10] <ezakimak> shouldn't they be inside a [] anyways?
[12:23:23] <lathan> jita, are youstill wanting to know when window closes?
[12:24:00] <jita> lathan, if you provide some insight that would be awesome
[12:24:15] <lathan> jita, unfortunatly its not too good
[12:24:45] <ezakimak> jita, are you just trying to see when the other window closes?
[12:24:50] <lathan> the child_window.onclose, .onbeforeunload don't seem to work
[12:25:07] <lathan> unload works if they refresh the page
[12:25:13] <jita> ezakimak, yeah i want to know when it closes i want to redirect the user to some other page, some survey page
[12:25:15] <lathan> but if they navigate away it seemt to cause problems
[12:25:35] <ezakimak> can't you do it in the child window? $(window).onunload( <tell parent window> ) ?
[12:25:40] <jita> lathan, i tried unload, it is working for me, i am on chrome, what sort of problems are there for unload ?
[12:25:55] <lathan> jita, it fires too much, and too little at the same time
[12:26:06] <lathan> jita, if you navigate away to a different page it doesn't fire
[12:26:08] <ezakimak> a lose canon.
[12:26:20] <lathan> jita, and it fires when the window is created because it changes from about:blank to your url
[12:26:32] <MaxymiserTE> Ultimately I would like all my links to have ?sort=Z-A&order=DESC as the site's default experience. So if someone comes to the site with another query or blank, it should redirect.
[12:26:40] <lathan> jita, you are better off having your child window tell the parent, or having an interval on the parent checking the child
[12:27:20] <ezakimak> jita, look at hashchange event
[12:29:54] <jita> the problem is i even want to have some sanity checks; Actually the child window is sort of virtual meeting room with text, audio and video chat, I just want to record the experience of a host who initiated that session. So i would like to make sure that only the host gets the redirection and that too when the session has consummated. For instance i would not want to redirect when the just opens and closes the window
[12:29:57] <jita> immediately
[12:31:05] <lathan> jita...got something for you: see http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/x7FTU/1/
[12:31:29] <lathan> jita, note: you have to open window twice...to create the parent and then the child window. cross domain scripting and all that....
[12:32:44] <w00nzs> I have 3 different elements in my json file (http://cuponaria.com/json/cupones.json)      i already check it in the json parser and is working fine. the problem is when i try to access to a certain property in an element for ex:   var cuponHeader = $('<div align="center"><h1>' + data.titulo[1] + '</h1><h2>' + data.empresa[0] + '</h2></div>');
[12:33:17] <w00nzs> and then append it $('div[data-role=header]').append(cuponHeader);
[12:33:23] <jita> lathan, ok thanks
[12:33:43] <w00nzs> why i cannot access the data array using data.titulo[0]  or data.titulo[1]  ?
[12:34:09] <w00nzs> im using: $.getJSON('cupones.json', function(data) {  in the document ready function
[12:34:14] <ezakimak> alert(data.titulo)
[12:35:00] <ezakimak> isn't data.titulo a string?
[12:35:03] <w00nzs> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of undefined
[12:35:06] <ezakimak> do you mean data[1].titulo?
[12:35:34] <ezakimak> it's not python, you can't slice a string in javascript with [] notation
[12:35:37] <w00nzs> LOL
[12:35:42] <Newtonianb> what doesthis jquery syntax mean (function (b) { ? it's not a function declaration
[12:35:43] <w00nzs> what a noob i am is working now
[12:35:52] <w00nzs> it was data[0].titulo
[12:36:08] <ezakimak> Newtonianb, yes, it is
[12:36:22] <Newtonianb> ezakimak: so what's the name of the function?
[12:36:23] <lathan> Newtonianb, I'm getting a smiley after function...is that ( $ )
[12:36:24] <ezakimak> it creates an anonymous function
[12:36:27] <lathan> ^^
[12:36:28] <ezakimak> it has no name
[12:36:37] <lathan> and no way to reference it
[12:36:57] <ezakimak> var foo = function bar(a) { ... } creates a function named bar and assigns it to foo, both foo(x) and bar(x) will work
[12:37:03] <lathan> (function( $ ){ ... })(jQuery) is a way to map jQuery into $ for a confined namespace of code @ Newtonianb
[12:37:03] <ezakimak> you capture the object
[12:37:18] <Wolf_22> I have a select box and I would like to apply a resizer grip to it's bottom-right corner. Would anyone happen to know where some documentation is that shows how this can be done?
[12:37:23] <ezakimak> w/o the bar, it's __name__ property is not set (or is it just name?)
[12:37:29] <Newtonianb> I see
[12:38:24] <ezakimak> function foo() {} creates a function object named foo in the local namespace, so does var foo = function() {}
[12:38:38] <ezakimak> except that the former also set's the name property on the function object
[12:38:45] <Newtonianb> so this basically means I can use $ isntead of typing the jquery syntax ?
[12:39:09] <ezakimak>  $ is just a variable name, you can use it for whatever you want
[12:39:30] <ezakimak> assigning $ to the jquery function object is a convenient shorthand
[12:40:16] <Newtonianb> thanks
[12:43:14] <mikehaas763> I'm looking for recommendations for a "colorbox". I am looking for simplicity. When a user clicks a row (<tr>) I want an overlay to shop up with a couple of options the user can click to act upon that row. (Such as print or edit).
[12:43:44] <mikehaas763> Or would this be all too easy to do with just plain jquery?
[12:43:51] <MaxymiserTE> Ultimately I would like all my links to have ?sort=Z-A&order=DESC as the site's default experience. So if someone comes to the site with another query or blank, it should redirect.
[12:45:43] <ezakimak> lots of ways to do that
[12:46:01] <ezakimak> but why would you want to redirect if they come w/a different query?
[12:46:13] <ezakimak> that would mean they *only* get the default, ever.
[12:46:30] <MaxymiserTE> We want to keep the default experience for testing.
[12:46:46] <ezakimak> you mean that's the only behavior you want?
[12:46:56] <ezakimak> just hard code it in the server.
[12:46:58] <MaxymiserTE> so anyone coming from  a different query, we need to change it on the fly
[12:47:07] <MaxymiserTE> yes but we need to do that in javascript
[12:47:08] <ezakimak> or hard code it in the page
[12:47:25] <ezakimak> the page can't control what the server sends w/o redirecting
[12:47:39] <ezakimak> in your onload just test the url if it doesn't match what you want, redirect.
[12:48:05] <MaxymiserTE> the point is that we want those who were bookmarking the URLs to go through our test  and not use the old link
[12:48:26] <ezakimak> so redirect
[12:48:39] <MaxymiserTE> How would I go about that?
[12:48:56] <MaxymiserTE> without it redirecting (window.location) on every link, causing an infinite loop
[12:49:05] <MaxymiserTE> it should not redirect if on our test query string
[12:49:11] <ezakimak> why would it infinite loop if you're first checking the url?
[12:49:35] <ezakimak> if (url != what I want) location = what I want;
[12:50:26] <MaxymiserTE> if (window.location != "query strings") redirect;
[12:50:36] <TelFiRE> What is the best way to go about troubleshooting something if it doesn't work, as in clicking the link does absolutely nothing. There are no errors. I am using someone else's plugin that works in an isolated situation but I guess something must be conflicting because it sure doesn't work for me
[12:51:09] <ezakimak> MaxymiserTE, you may have to write smarter code for your test--pick apart the url elements and just look at the pieces that matter
[12:52:36] <ezakimak> TelFiRE, javascript console for starters
[12:52:43] <ezakimak> using firefox?
[12:52:50] <TelFiRE> there are no errors
[12:53:08] <ezakimak> start putting in alert("got here") then. track it down.
[12:53:25] <TelFiRE> it's a one-line function
[12:53:29] <TelFiRE> there's nowhere to call that
[12:53:55] <ezakimak> put it at the beginning of the function
[12:54:01] <ezakimak> see if the function is even being called
[12:54:31] <ezakimak> put an alert in the onclick of the link, see if that's firing
[12:54:48] <await> Hmm, I'm having problems with getJSON. How do I get the json string out from it? Here's what I'm doing: $.getJSON(url, alert(data))
[12:54:48] <ezakimak> put an alert right *before* the function to see if it's even getting read
[12:55:22] <await> "data" keeps coming back undefined, though.
[12:57:10] <ezakimak> because you are passing data to alert before calling $.getJSON()
[12:57:35] <ezakimak> what's in data before calling it?
[12:57:52] <await> I don't know. I thought data was a part of getJSON
[12:58:36] <ezakimak> getJSON(url [, data] ...) data is the data you are passing to getJSON()--you have to provide it
[12:59:11] <w00nzs> await: Im working with that
[12:59:16] <ezakimak> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[12:59:16] <w00nzs> i can send you the code if you want
[12:59:23] <await> Oh, so how do I get the json string out from it? I pretty much just want to parse it with parseJSON
[13:00:10] <ezakimak> the 3rd parameter is a callback function, either give it the name of a function already existing, or pass it a function object
[13:00:33] <ezakimak> that function will be called and passed the data received from the server
[13:01:10] <ezakimak> there's examples in the docs
[13:01:51] <await> oh, so it should be getJSON(url, null, parseJSON)? I was just looking at the examples in http://www.jquery4u.com/json/ajaxjquery-getjson-simple/#.UCv6Ihqe7qM
[13:01:59] <w00nzs> await: you first connect to the json file, then you store the data into variables and then you append it to your DOM using .append
[13:02:00] <w00nzs> http://fiddle.jshell.net/LqvGX/
[13:02:02] <ezakimak> await, no.
[13:02:06] <w00nzs> there's an example
[13:02:09] <w00nzs> is working for me
[13:02:15] <Newtonianb> could someone explain the difference between $(..) and $(window).load(...) in the following code which are the first two lines of a script I'm trying to make sense of $($.proxy(MS._msInit, MS));     $(window).load($.proxy(MS._msStart, MS));
[13:02:19] <ezakimak> that will call parseJSON with the data, but the result goes nowhere
[13:02:55] <ezakimak> await, just look at the examples in the docs
[13:03:02] <await> Got it
[13:03:14] <TelFiRE> I type "jQuery('#mobileMenu').pageslide({direction:'left', modal:true});" and it returns "undefined" what does this mean? WHAT is undefined? Certainly the function is defined.
[13:03:15] <await> w00nzs: thanks
[13:03:39] <w00nzs> im trying to list the json file now in a listview almost done
[13:05:07] <Newtonianb> anyone?
[13:06:02] <ezakimak> Newtonianb, what is MS ?
[13:06:10] <Newtonianb> it's an object with functions
[13:06:16] <ezakimak> and what's $
[13:06:23] <ezakimak> if those are the first two lines, what defined them?
[13:06:41] <Newtonianb> oh sorry in the body before the object was defined then this script was called which knows of them
[13:07:10] <Newtonianb> ok that answers part of my question
[13:07:18] <Newtonianb> that $ does have to get defined somehow
[13:07:23] <Newtonianb> to represent jquery
[13:08:17] <ezakimak> what is $ now?
[13:08:41] <w00nzs> how do i select the <ul data-role="listview"></ul>    inside the "content" div ??? using jquery ??
[13:08:56] <w00nzs> i already tried $('ul data-role="listview"').append(lista);
[13:08:57] <lathan> jita, hey....wow...another possible solution for you: $.proxy
[13:09:07] <lathan> jita, that allows you to set the this context to be whatever you want
[13:09:08] <Newtonianb> ezakimak: (function (b) { }(jQuery));
[13:09:12] <NoiseEee> $('ul[data-role="listview"]'); @ w00nzs
[13:09:13] <Newtonianb> Is this what defines $?
[13:09:27] <lathan> Newtonianb, yes, jQuery is passed into the $ function
[13:09:45] <Newtonianb> lathan: but this is defined below the two lines mentioned above
[13:09:50] <ezakimak> w00nzs, $("ul attr[data-role=listview]") ?
[13:10:20] <lathan> Newtonianb, when you have a function you have a different level of variable scope, and you can have "inner" or more private versions of the same variable
[13:10:28] <ezakimak> lathan,  there is also bind()
[13:10:46] <w00nzs> the listview style is gone
[13:10:49] <lathan> ezakimak, its more complicated than that. jita is working on passing data between a parent and child window
[13:10:53] <w00nzs> refresh ?
[13:11:18] <w00nzs> $('#mylist').listview('refresh');     ??
[13:11:26] <w00nzs> how do i use it in that listview
[13:11:32] <w00nzs> oh ok im getting it
[13:11:34] <w00nzs> yeahh!
[13:11:47] <w00nzs> just <ul id="mylist"
[13:12:54] <w00nzs> omg this is fun
[13:13:14] <w00nzs> im having micro orgasms everytime a problem is solved
[13:14:32] <rue> Programming is clearly going to be a rewarding profession for you
[13:14:34] <Newtonianb> when you define a function name starting with _ does it mean anything special? I know some php frameworks where that means private is this the same thing?
[13:15:42] <Brodingo> Newtonianb no
[13:15:48] <snover> Newtonianb: the convention is that _ indicates a method or property that is not guaranteed to stay the same, or continue to exist in the future, and should not be accessed by end-user code.
[13:15:49] <jita> lathan, Can i access DOM elements give the window object?
[13:16:00] <Newtonianb> ok
[13:19:56] <sparuvu> hey guys what is the best way to detect the change in the value of the textbox ?
[13:20:09] <ezakimak> jita, probably, they all on it somewher
[13:20:40] <ezakimak> onkeyup or onchange
[13:20:50] <sparuvu> I want to detect every activity  like  backspace, delete , ctrl + x , ctrl + v etc
[13:21:16] <sparuvu> onChange is effective only on blur
[13:21:17] <ezakimak> those would require onkeydown
[13:21:38] <sparuvu> :ezakimak : thank you
[13:21:40] <sparuvu> :)
[13:22:06] <Newtonianb> should I be using <script> or <script type="text/avascript">  I'm perplexed why this site which seemingly was developed by very profficient javascript developer is using the former
[13:22:07] <ezakimak> look at jQuery.live()
[13:22:16] <blackpowa> http://users9.nofeehost.com/electronicmaji/
[13:22:27] <blackpowa> ok so i copied the same code on the second photo element
[13:22:41] <blackpowa> and instead of the effect I'm just getting the three pictures displayed in a row what gives
[13:23:40] <ezakimak> Newtonianb, text/javascript is the default
[13:23:46] <await> When I use getJSON in the chrome web inspector, it warns me that "Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/html". Is that a big deal? I don't control the server that I'm getting json from, so I don't think I can do anything about it.
[13:23:48] <Jon47> Newtonianb: every browser in the world treats a script tag as javascript, adding the type attribute is generally considered extraneous, although it could theoretically future proof the page in the case that other scriping languages become popular, although I imagine in that case browsers would at least default to "text/javascript"
[13:24:19] <ezakimak> Newtonianb, just don't use xhtml and you'll be fine
[13:24:24] <sparuvu> :ezakimak :  not working if I cut the text inside the textbox :(
[13:25:13] <ezakimak> sparuvu, you can probably find some examples of what you're trying on stack overflow, or just google for some
[13:26:20] <ezakimak> html5 standard says that text/javascript is the default, prior I think i'ts just been defacto, so looks like moving forward it's definitely safe to elide it
[13:27:03] <cambazz> hello, how do i know if given #id is a textarea or input?
[13:28:18] <pandemic> cambazz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1532331/can-jquery-provide-the-tag-name
[13:29:49] <blackpowa> ezakimak
[13:29:57] <blackpowa> any suggestions
[13:31:46] <ezakimak> blackpowa, they both have the same value for their id, which is not legal
[13:31:56] <ezakimak> you're lucky either work
[13:32:19] <blackpowa> how do i change the id value
[13:32:28] <ezakimak> make one id="slider2", and add $('#slider2").nivoSlider(); to your load function
[13:33:22] <blackpowa> ok
[13:33:24] <blackpowa> thank you
[13:35:36] <blackpowa> $(window).load(function(){
[13:35:37] <blackpowa> 	$('#slider').nivoSlider();
[13:35:37] <blackpowa>    $('#slider2").nivoSlider();
[13:35:38] <blackpowa> });
[13:35:50] <blackpowa> I'm missing a closing bracket here i tihnk
[13:36:03] <ezakimak> no, you have mismatched quotes
[13:36:10] <ezakimak> '#slider2"
[13:36:16] <blackpowa> oh
[13:36:16] <blackpowa> thanks
[13:36:31] <ezakimak> does your editor not syntax highlight?
[13:36:31] <blackpowa> ok now it works thanks
[13:36:36] <blackpowa> no it does
[13:36:38] <blackpowa> I'm just nota coder
[13:36:42] <ryanneufeld> blackpowa: $(function(){  instead of $(window).load(function(){
[13:37:15] <ezakimak> ryanneufeld, why?
[13:37:32] <ryanneufeld> in my exp using window load isn't really reliable
[13:37:36] <blackpowa> well it works now thanks
[13:37:44] <ezakimak> oh. seems to be working for him though
[13:37:51] <ryanneufeld> and the offically recommended method is document ready
[13:38:13] <sporkf> moin
[13:38:17] <ezakimak> $(document).ready(...) ?
[13:38:35] <ezakimak> what about just putting it in a body onload handler?
[13:38:45] <ryanneufeld> is the same as $(function(){});
[13:41:35] * ezakimak didn't know that
[13:42:27] <ryanneufeld> ezakimak: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js check out the core
[13:44:44] <sporkf> what's the oposite of .is()  ?
[13:45:04] <ryanneufeld> ?not()
[13:45:04] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[13:45:10] <ryanneufeld> ?is()
[13:45:10] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[13:45:24] <sporkf> thanks.
[13:45:30] <ryanneufeld> sporkf: my guess would be you'd just use a !
[13:45:38] <ryanneufeld> .not is not the opposite of .is()
[13:45:38] <b-ot> ryanneufeld, memorised ‚Äúnot‚Äù.
[13:45:42] <garciawebdev> could be .is(':not(.selector)')
[13:45:52] <garciawebdev> is there a .not() ?
[13:45:55] <ryanneufeld> yes
[13:45:59] <ryanneufeld> ?not
[13:45:59] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[13:46:01] <garciawebdev> good
[13:46:09] <ryanneufeld> but it doesn't do the opposite of is
[13:46:12] <garciawebdev> thanks
[13:46:15] <sporkf> I want the oposite of .is(':visable')
[13:46:38] <ryanneufeld> sporkf: do you know what the difference between !== and === is?
[13:46:52] <sporkf> value and type
[13:46:57] <ryanneufeld> no
[13:47:11] <ryanneufeld> one is not equals and one is equals
[13:47:20] <ryanneufeld> type is cause i used the extra =
[13:47:27] <ryanneufeld> .is(':visable') !== true
[13:47:34] <ryanneufeld> is the opposite
[13:47:57] <PrgmrBill> visible*
[13:48:19] <PrgmrBill> is .is(':hidden') not the opposite?
[13:48:49] <garciawebdev> PrgmrBill, yes in this case it's valid
[13:51:56] <TelFiRE> Sad :( seems there's no prominent jquery plugin for mobile navigation... kind of baffling really, I'd think there'd be dozens
[13:52:14] <ezakimak> is jqMobi any good?
[13:52:41] <garciawebdev> TelFiRE what do you mean with "mobile navigation"?
[13:52:43] <sporkf>  return !$(".save_button").is(":visible");
[13:53:11] <TelFiRE> garciawebdev: like facebook or sony, where it has a little menu icon and you press it and it slides the page out of frame and shows nested nav buttons
[13:53:22] <TelFiRE> you hit one and it slides over and shows you the child nav of that etc
[13:53:50] <garciawebdev> sporkf, also as PrgmrBill said, "return $(".save_button").is(":hidden");" you can choose
[13:54:06] <hamcore> How do i retrieve all selected options from a select (text and value)?
[13:54:07] <ezakimak> sporkf, why not use .is(":hidden") ?
[13:54:32] <hamcore> $("#id :selected").text() returns the text, .val() returns the value, i want both.
[13:54:55] <ezakimak> so do both
[13:55:14] <hamcore> i want something like value, text.
[13:55:28] <sporkf> ezakimak: if save button is not in the dom, :hidden will return false.
[13:55:28] <ezakimak> so make it
[13:55:44] <hamcore> ezakimak how?
[13:55:49] <ezakimak> if it's not in the dom will the selector even find it?
[13:55:56] <hamcore> i'm using javascript console
[13:56:08] <garciawebdev> hamcore: each on every selected element
[13:56:15] <sporkf> ezakimak:
[13:56:28] <ezakimak> el = $("#id :selected"); str = el.val() + ", " + el.text();
[13:56:53] <garciawebdev> TelFiRE, look at Twitter Bootstrap responsive design, I think they do it with pure CSS
[13:57:06] <hamcore> ezakimak it does return the first value + all texts
[13:57:20] <await> is getJSON fussy with MIME types? It keeps erroring out and warns "Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/html", but I'm not sure if those two are related.
[13:57:51] <ezakimak> what is el above? a list?
[13:58:06] <ezakimak> await, is it working?
[13:59:03] <await> No, it alerts error with getJSON(stuff).error(function() { alert("error"); })
[13:59:13] <await> error and complete are triggered.
[13:59:45] <await> So I'm trying to hunt down why it would error out. Would it have anything to do with the odd MIME type?
[13:59:49] <ezakimak> does complete have the data you need?
[13:59:52] <TelFiRE> garciawebdev: I don't think that would be possible considering css can't detect a click. But that aside, I'm not seeing anything like what I described in twitter bootstrap
[14:00:15] <hamcore> $("#dept_id :selected").each(function(){ console.log($(this).val() + " " + $(this).text()) }) works
[14:00:30] <Flo_> !nick
[14:00:46] <await> Hmm, not sure, I'll try
[14:01:29] <ezakimak> you might just want to examine the error, and ignore that one if it's actually working. warnings don't mean failures always
[14:03:45] <await> It doesn't look like it. With -- .complete(function(data) { console.log($.parseJSON(data)); }) -- it returns null.
[14:03:59] <await> But data does exist, apparently
[14:04:05] <TelFiRE> If you go to sony.com and make your browser extremely thin, you can see the nav I'm talking about. It is hierarchal, you just see the top-level links, and when you click it it doesn't take you to a page but rather slides the next level of links in, until you actually click one that's a page and has no sub links
[14:04:31] <TelFiRE> like, I see it everywhere, and it's totally standard mobile navigation, but I can't find out how to do it anywhere :(
[14:04:58] <garciawebdev> TelFiRE: with media queries, if resolution is less than your desired width, you hide the regular links and show a <button> tag
[14:05:02] <ezakimak> await, just log the raw data firts
[14:05:04] <ezakimak> first
[14:05:27] <TelFiRE> garciawebdev: that's really not related
[14:05:46] <garciawebdev> TelFiRE, and that <button> tag you can make it show or hide a menu (it could be also the same menu you hidden restyled to be shown differently)
[14:05:53] <TelFiRE> I know how to use media queries, I'm asking how to make a menu that shows the top-level and then when you click it shows the next level
[14:06:30] <TelFiRE> garciawebdev: Um I appreciate you trying to help but that's not even remotely relevant to what I am asking
[14:06:46] <TelFiRE> I am not asking about css or media queries..
[14:06:51] <await> ezakimak: I did that, I'm not sure what I'm looking at. I just has abort, always, complete, done, etc functions
[14:07:34] <await> TelFiRE: twitter bootstrap comes with something like that. maybe not the nesting, I never looked into that
[14:07:44] <TelFiRE> But the nesting is specifically what I am asking about
[14:07:57] <garciawebdev> TelFiRE, that's what I understood of what you said
[14:08:06] <garciawebdev> it's ok
[14:08:13] <NoiseEee> TelFiRE: it's just showing/hiding other <ul>s in the menu
[14:08:54] <TelFiRE> I know but I'm not going to give every single link a unique id and match it with a unique ID on its child terms and write a seperate function for every single link... surely there must be a plugin out there or something...
[14:10:10] <TelFiRE> Sorry I am not explaining myself clearly :P but yeah I see twitter bootstrap has the drop-down type thing, but dropdowns are easy and that's not remotely my problem. My issue is the nesting part of it
[14:11:30] <NoiseEee> it's just using classes wisely.  look at sony.com.  <li class='sub'>.  so, when a class with 'sub' is moused-over, it shows the children or something
[14:21:23] <ezakimak> await, sounds like it's an object
[14:21:58] <await> yea, it's an object, I'm just not sure where to look for the actual json string
[14:22:30] <await> The status is 200, so I'm not sure why it triggered an error.
[14:25:42] <Bryce> I'm having trouble extending a function and have some sample code to explain if someone doesn't mind looking: http://jsfiddle.net/2v9mH/
[14:26:35] <jita> Cant i do something like $('textarea', form) ?
[14:28:37] <shoky> Bryce: why not keep a reference to 'this' and use it in the inner function?  var self = this;
[14:28:50] <ezakimak> await i think the object you're logging is the ajax request object, not the data being returned
[14:30:27] <await> That would make sense. I'm doing -- console.log(data) -- though, which I would expect to be the data returned
[14:30:33] <shoky> Bryce: or maybe i misunderstood your meaning.. what do you expect 'this' to be in each scope
[14:31:14] <MistuhKurtz> jita, that's a context selector
[14:31:35] <MistuhKurtz> in that case, form must be a var b/c it's not in quotes
[14:32:02] <ezakimak> await, where is data coming from? paste your code
[14:32:05] <ezakimak> (pastebin)
[14:32:10] <await> Will do
[14:33:46] <await> ezakimak: https://gist.github.com/3363883
[14:35:16] <await> it's alerting "error" and then logging the "complete" data object
[14:35:49] <shoky> Bryce: also i think you're using .call wrong.. and why are your callback arguments event & caller? when .bind only passes an event?
[14:36:33] <ezakimak> await, you are passing a function object as the data parameter to getJSON()
[14:36:56] <await> in a few examples, there is no data parameter
[14:37:11] <await> it's just url and then function to call on success
[14:37:19] <ezakimak> await, oh. nm.
[14:38:04] <await> if it matters, when I go to the api url directly, it shows up in my browser just fine.
[14:40:21] <ezakimak> why don't you use function(data) { alert(data); } rather than just alert("success") ?
[14:40:46] <await> I probably tried that once, I'll do it again
[14:40:51] <tw2113> console.log is better
[14:41:51] <await> Yeah. It doesn't really matter, though, because it only calls that function on success. But there's an error somewhere.
[14:42:30] <ezakimak> can you add logging on the server?
[14:42:47] <await> I don't have access to the server. It's a foreign API.
[14:43:50] <ezakimak> oh, right. well, I got a json error when I tried
[14:44:49] <TheFuzzball> I'm trying to get the computed width of an element after the DOM becomes ready but the width is erroneously reported as 0.
[14:45:03] <await> Yeah. This is a pain.
[14:45:43] <TheFuzzball> Do I need to timeout or something? I'm finding the width within $(document).ready(‚Ä¶), that should do it.
[14:47:43] <blendedbychris> there's no reason why I can't store a function in .data right?
[14:48:08] <LakWork> nope, none
[14:48:32] <LakWork> the memory overhead would be a little heavy if the element is every duplicated
[14:48:44] <LakWork> but probably not noticeable
[14:48:49] <blendedbychris> how would i execute it?
[14:48:49] <blendedbychris> ?
[14:49:18] <blendedbychris> var foo = ‚Ä¶.data('') ‚Ä¶ foo(); ?
[14:49:19] <LakWork> $('#el').data('foo').apply(this, [args]) should work
[14:49:29] <LakWork> in theory
[14:49:31] <blendedbychris> apply?
[14:49:34] <LakWork> yup
[14:49:39] <blendedbychris> interesting
[14:49:46] <ezakimak> just $('#el').data('foo')() should work
[14:49:55] <LakWork> or you can use call()
[14:50:01] <LakWork> or () would probably work too
[14:50:07] <LakWork> http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2007/07/05/function-apply-and-function-call-in-javascript.aspx
[14:50:20] <LakWork> although i dont necessarily recommend () for the sake of usability
[14:50:25] <LakWork> err, readability*
[14:50:36] <ezakimak> why? we use it everywhere w/jquery
[14:51:27] <ezakimak> also, of note: var foo = ....data(''); foo(); is not the same as ...data(')-- this will be different
[14:52:06] <ezakimak> um, maybe not.
[14:52:13] <ezakimak> yeah. nm.
[14:52:39] <LakWork> it's just not very readable: $('#el').data('someField')();
[14:53:57] <LakWork> i would do something like var func = $('#el').data('someField'); if(typeof func === 'function') { func.call(this, arg1, arg2, arg3); }
[14:57:52] <TelFiRE> am I missing something obvious here? jQuery(this).animate({left:'-100%'}, 1500);  .....unexpected token } my ass
[15:06:00] <TelFiRE> jQuery('#mobileContain lvl1 a').click(function(){ alert('HELLLLOOOOOO'); });  this does not produce an alert! it is as simple as it gets, I swear jquery is just not working for me.... it doesn't throw errors, it just simply does not work
[15:06:20] <TelFiRE> If I copy and paste the selector it works to style it so I know that's right
[15:10:27] <smithbh> TelFiRE is the jquery library being loaded correctly into the document?  If so, have you tried wrapping your function in jQuery(document).ready(function()      }); ?
[15:10:33] <blackpowa> are there any query based blogging platforms?
[15:10:35] <smithbh> are any error messages being returned in the console?
[15:10:36] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, lvl1 is not a selector
[15:10:38] <TelFiRE> yes it is, all my other jquery works fine
[15:10:48] <MistuhKurtz> do you mean for it to be a class selector?
[15:10:59] <smithbh> I think MistuhKurtz is right
[15:11:06] <MistuhKurtz> blackpowa, wordpress uses jQuery
[15:11:07] <TelFiRE> god dammit I should be fired
[15:11:12] <smithbh> guessing you don't have a DOM element <lvl1>
[15:11:17] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[15:13:34] <TelFiRE> ok it wasn't that...
[15:13:56] <blackpowa> MistuhKurtz
[15:14:06] <blackpowa> u r so fine mistuhkurtz thank yo usuh
[15:14:12] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, make a jsfiddle
[15:14:14] <MistuhKurtz> np blackpowa
[15:14:29] <blackpowa> mastuh suh
[15:14:40] <blackpowa> yeah you think I'm just gonna sit here while you flaunt your white power
[15:14:46] <blackpowa> ITS TIME FOR A BLACK REVOLUTION
[15:14:55] <MistuhKurtz> but I'm black
[15:15:04] <blackpowa> wat
[15:15:04] <b-ot> grr i just want that number that shows in the alert to be where the i is below it in the has
[15:15:06] <blackpowa> mind = blown
[15:15:53] <TelFiRE> what can cause you to get a syntax error, unexpected token, when there is not one
[15:16:08] <MistuhKurtz> a syntax error you're having trouble seeing
[15:16:08] <MistuhKurtz> :P
[15:29:42] <TelFiRE> This is absolutely nuts. There is no way I'm going to get this working right
[15:29:57] <TelFiRE> Is there seriously no nested navigation plugin out there? like at all>!
[15:45:59] <textchimp> can anyone suggest how i could have a .draggable() image (using the 'clone' helper) stay where i drop it?
[15:57:56] <deepjoy> Hi I was using multiple-attribute-selector with a OR configuration in jQuery 1.7 but this seems to be broken in sizzle/jQuery version 1.8 is there an alternate way to do this in jquery
[15:58:41] <hi8is> Hi All
[15:58:46] <deepjoy> a:not([href^="#"]|[href=""])
[15:59:20] <deepjoy> Hi hi8is
[15:59:34] <shoky> OR? with a pipe?
[15:59:38] <shoky> that worked?
[15:59:43] <deepjoy> yeah thats how it used to work
[15:59:53] <deepjoy> still does with jQuery 1.7
[16:00:00] <deepjoy> or any version after 1.3 I think
[16:00:16] <shoky> well i only knew about using a comma
[16:00:25] <deepjoy> thats a new selector
[16:00:53] <shoky> documented where?
[16:00:54] <deepjoy> yeah I guess I could re-write it like that
[16:00:59] <hi8is> Hi Deepjoy :)
[16:03:18] <deepjoy> @shoky looking for it but can't find it right now
[16:03:35] <shoky> deepjoy: it didn't work before 1.8 either.. it just didn't throw an error
[16:04:50] <deepjoy> so you are saying that was equivalent to           a:not([href^="#"][href=""])
[16:04:59] <deepjoy> but without the explicit JS error?
[16:05:13] <shoky> no
[16:07:29] <shoky> my guess is it treated the pipe as just another character
[16:08:38] <shoky> (i.e. part of the tag name)
[16:09:29] <hi8is> deepjoy - can you take a look here - i'd like to know how to select an element when writing a function... not based on the ID but on parent / child stuff... it's new to me.
[16:09:36] <hi8is> I made a pastebin that explains well
[16:09:37] <hi8is> http://pastebin.com/ZCZVGvXw
[16:10:04] <hi8is> normally i would just add an ID on each sub-menu class and target that in the function
[16:10:11] <hi8is> but I can't do so in this situation
[16:10:16] <bailus> hi8is you can do that with css?
[16:10:20] <hi8is> and thus, need help learning how to select
[16:10:32] <hi8is> bailus: huh?
[16:10:42] <bailus> parent > child { display:none }
[16:10:49] <bailus> parent:hover > child { display:block }
[16:11:14] <hi8is> does that hide it on off hover?
[16:11:28] <bailus> yeah
[16:11:32] <hi8is> i guess i'm not just gonna show() but rather toggle()
[16:11:36] <hi8is> oh, wow, cool
[16:11:38] <hi8is> didn't know that
[16:12:07] <hi8is> so in this case, it would be...
[16:12:08] <hi8is> .show1 > ul { display:none }
[16:12:08] <hi8is> ?
[16:12:29] <bailus> yeah
[16:12:34] <hi8is> interesting
[16:12:37] <bailus> that hides it
[16:12:37] <hi8is> let me give her a show
[16:12:38] <hi8is> shot
[16:12:44] <bailus> then the second line shows it when its hovered
[16:12:59] <bailus> .show1:hover ...
[16:13:01] <hi8is> oh i see
[16:19:26] <deepjoy> @shoky you are right
[16:19:26] <b-ot> deepjoy, no YOU ARE right
[16:19:33] <deepjoy> looks like I have abug in my code
[16:19:47] <deepjoy> which I came to know of only when 1.8 hit
[16:20:34] <hi8is> @bailus: I'm having trouble writing the correct selection in CSS... can you take a look at this and show me what 1 correct example would be? http://pastebin.com/5eyRF1Dz
[16:44:43] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. I'm getting the error $ is not a function, but I am not using any scripts except for jquery so I dont think i need noconflict mode.. I dont reallt know how to troubleshoot this
[16:44:57] <hi8is> Use jQuery instead of $
[16:44:57] <hi8is> ?
[16:45:09] <LindsayMac> I should not have to in this case
[16:45:21] <hi8is> odd
[16:45:39] <LindsayMac> https://gist.github.com/d29d0efda6579f06b3f1 <~~ thats the only js code in my doc
[16:46:02] <LindsayMac> I'm only using one jquery slider plugin and just triyng to include another animation. Its a very strange thing!
[16:46:06] <coldhead> are you seeing jQuery loading in the network tab of your debugger?
[16:46:34] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  yea its loaded
[16:46:51] <LindsayMac> oops that code has an error, but you get the idea
[16:47:00] <LindsayMac> the code i pasted.. not the code on the site
[16:47:35] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  jquery is called first, then the slider plugin files and my code is executed in the footer
[16:49:01] <igcewieling> I'm a n00b.  I'm trying to use jQuery inside an iframe (same domain, etc).  Obviously $ is not defined in the iframe (but it is in the parent).  should "window.parent.$('selector').whatever" work?
[16:49:11] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  i can PM you a link to the dev site if you dont mind taking a look
[16:49:23] <coldhead> LindsayMac: can you see jQuery or $ at the JS console in your debugger?
[16:49:49] <coldhead> i can't take a look just now because i am fixing an urgent bug for some cunt before he demos it to some other cunt
[16:49:52] <LindsayMac> In the console I just see the error
[16:49:54] <LindsayMac> Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function /medteam/blog/:417
[16:49:55] <LindsayMac> (anonymous function)
[16:50:09] <coldhead> that really sounds like your jQuery isn't loading
[16:50:12] <LindsayMac> but in firebug I just get $ is not a function
[16:50:19] <LindsayMac> but it is.. i am 100$ sure
[16:50:19] <coldhead> try loading jQuery from a CDN
[16:50:31] <coldhead> no, if you can't see jQuery at the console it is not loaded
[16:50:41] <ngharo> hi coldhead!
[16:50:52] <w00nzs> how can i tell jquery to go to a div ?
[16:51:03] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  what do you mean??
[16:51:12] <LindsayMac> of o cant see it in the console?
[16:51:19] <LindsayMac> the console is for logging and errors..
[16:51:27] <ngharo> LindsayMac: did you type '$' into the console, like coldhead said?
[16:51:37] <ngharo> firebug console
[16:51:52] <coldhead> LindsayMac: firebug/web inspector has a Console where you can evaluate JS expressions
[16:51:56] <ngharo> w00nzs: that depends on the div
[16:52:01] <LindsayMac> Ah i missed that
[16:52:07] <w00nzs> in the same page
[16:52:16] <LindsayMac> if i type $ it says undefined
[16:52:22] <LindsayMac> i'm just learning the debugging tools for JS
[16:52:48] <bigLanky> i need a jquery slider to do this
[16:52:48] <bigLanky> http://screencast.com/t/szwejJxkW
[16:53:01] <ngharo> LindsayMac: so jquery is definitely not loaded then
[16:53:03] <shoky> LindsayMac i can check your site if you want
[16:53:27] <LindsayMac> yea except in the header of the site, you see the script link with a src that goes to the file on my server..
[16:53:29] <bigLanky> basically, there are 5 links that are text... and each link has an associated block of content. the left/right arrows will shift the links and load the appropriate text for the middle link. i also need the links to wrap
[16:53:30] <LindsayMac> shoky:  k
[16:53:31] <ngharo> w00nzs: yes, i figured.  But you need a way to tell jquery how to find the div.  You can give your div an id or class for instance
[16:53:57] <deepjoy> @shoky thank you.
[16:54:28] <shoky> deepjoy np
[16:55:44] <frewsxcv> Why do the elements not need to be emptied() before they are appended here http://www.onemoretake.com/2009/02/25/sorting-elements-with-jquery/
[16:58:57] <frewsxcv> Meaning, how is it reordering instead of just duplicating elements at the end
[17:02:07] <shoky> frewsxcv: because .append() doesn't clone your elements. if you append an existing element, it'll just move
[17:02:27] <shoky> oh hm
[17:02:32] <shoky> think i see what you mean
[17:02:57] <frewsxcv> shoky: Ah, that answers my question
[17:03:05] <shoky> actually yeah that's it :P
[17:03:24] <shoky> you got me confused for a sec too ;p
[17:03:59] <w00nzs> how to clear a litstview like the refresh?
[17:04:00] <w00nzs> $('#listado').listview('refresh');
[17:04:19] <w00nzs> i want to populate a listview but it doesnt not delente prior data and do the loop again
[17:05:14] <shoky> w00nzs: can't you just .empty() it?
[17:06:06] <w00nzs> $('#listado').empty   ??
[17:06:21] <shoky> .empty()  yes ..
[17:06:45] <shoky> and maybe you'd need to refresh after that, no idea
[17:13:38] <pandemic> yeah, just $('#listado').empty().listview('refresh');
[17:13:44] <pandemic> shaky is right
[17:13:52] <pandemic> *shoky, damn autocomplete
[17:24:15] <bigmeow> hi all
[17:24:24] <bigmeow> anybody here use emacs to program javascript?
[17:24:29] <javalover> hello jquery I have a facebook question but noobdy is avail in facebook
[17:28:06] <blackpowa> how hard is seo?
[17:36:17] <webe> Hi, I'm trying to create a simple validation script. For some reason it only validates the first input: http://pastebin.com/A7AHCnAf
[17:39:51] <shoky> webe: that looks like it wouldn't validate any fields and do nothing really. and there are many other problems there :S
[17:45:10] <webe> thanks shoky, i guess validate isn't the correct word
[17:45:35] <webe> It is supposed to log if the errors return tru
[17:45:37] <webe> true*
[17:46:09] <webe> If any one field is left empty it is supposed to return true
[17:46:46] <webe> shoky, any advice would be appreciated
[17:46:47] <shoky> webe: $text = $('input[type="text"]');  and  $select = $('select');  should not be in your FormValidator constructor
[17:47:20] <shoky> you should have var $text = $('input[type="text"]'), $select = $('select');  at the top
[17:48:21] <webe> ok
[17:48:48] <webe> since I'm passing those to the form object?
[17:48:54] <shoky> webe: in your validate function.. the only thing you do is:   this.emptyFields = function() { ... }
[17:49:01] <shoky> in other words: you're not doing anything
[17:49:06] <shoky> and you're misuing 'this
[17:49:08] <shoky> 'this'
[17:49:16] <shoky> misusing 'this' ;s
[17:50:47] <yen_> anyone know a similar slideshow like this one on huffington post here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nil-zacharias/this-is-how-we-do-it-10-a_b_939895.html# but can be used in wordpress?
[17:50:55] <webe> I plan to add more methods to the validate function, that is why there is only one so far
[17:52:16] <shoky> webe: still, you can't use 'this' like that inside a nested function, unless you specifically set the context yourself (which you didn't in your paste..)
[17:52:43] <shoky> webe: and still, all you are doing is defining that emptyFields function, you're not calling it anywhere. you're not validating anything. you're just defining a function.
[17:53:00] <yen_> shoky any idea re; my question
[17:53:15] <shoky> yen_: no
[17:53:24] <yen_> did u see the slideshow?
[17:53:26] <shoky> no
[17:53:38] <shoky> i dont know slideshow plugins and i dont know wordpress, i cant be of much help
[17:53:47] <yen_> no worries, thanks
[17:59:39] <fission6> anyone here use session.js, i can't get the htm5 geolocation in the cookie
[18:04:17] <Raydiation> i use jquery draggable and i cant seem to get out of a nested list
[18:05:45] <shoky> learn to ask a question, guise
[18:07:19] <fission6> is there a logical reason why this code isn't storing to a cookie but othe rlocations are https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L272
[18:14:08] <Raydiation> is there a paste for jquery ui too`?
[18:16:04] <imsky> no
[18:19:43] <Ivis> hi
[18:33:05] <fission6> is there a way to call this from a <script> https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L350
[18:48:17] <fission6> should i store geolocation in a cookie so i can send server side
[18:50:19] <RoDiMuS-X> Depends if your using HTML5 you can use local storage
[18:52:03] <RoDiMuS-X> Another option might be session storage
[18:53:45] <fission6> RoDiMuS-X: all seem reasonable but local and session storage dont get sent with each request right?
[18:55:11] <RoDiMuS-X> They work similar to a Cookie
[18:55:44] <RoDiMuS-X> instead of a text file they are stored in a SQLLite db depending upon browser it maybe a different mini database technology
[18:55:57] <fission6> right but are they sent server side
[18:56:03] <fission6> thats where i need the location
[18:56:45] <RoDiMuS-X> You can use Javascript to send them server side yes
[18:57:18] <fission6> https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L272 i dont get this though, the author stores everything in a cookie but the html5 location
[19:00:35] <RoDiMuS-X> he is using a cookie
[19:00:39] <RoDiMuS-X>  util.set_cookie(
[19:00:39] <RoDiMuS-X>               options.location_cookie,
[19:01:04] <fission6> not for the html location only for the fall back location
[19:01:11] <fission6> gapi or whatever
[19:02:20] <RoDiMuS-X> Right but it looks like they are passing the Geotagg info to Google
[19:03:37] <RoDiMuS-X> gapi is using a cookie  var location = util.get_obj(options.location_cookie);
[19:04:05] <fission6> thats to check if its cached / already saved
[19:04:20] <RoDiMuS-X> no
[19:04:35] <RoDiMuS-X> thats setting the variable location to whats stored in the cookie
[19:04:57] <fission6> all im saying is https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L276 does not put the locatio in th cookie
[19:07:49] <RoDiMuS-X> gapi_location is where the location is being set in the cookie
[19:08:13] <fission6> maybe i am not following
[19:09:08] <RoDiMuS-X> https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L26
[19:09:14] <RoDiMuS-X> its defined in line 26
[19:10:19] <RoDiMuS-X> Line 297 the cookie is set
[19:11:51] <fission6> im sorry but i just dont see how the cookie is set, and its not being set - when the html5 method is being used
[19:11:55] <fission6>  html5_location
[19:12:13] <fission6> it just calls https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L276
[19:13:02] <RoDiMuS-X> 274 gets the location
[19:13:26] <RoDiMuS-X> 279 is calling 285
[19:14:04] <RoDiMuS-X> which is if all is fine and dandy 297 sets the cookie
[19:14:43] <fission6> yea with the gapi id, i think one of use is missing some here
[19:14:53] <fission6> and given that i dont see the cookie being set
[19:15:35] <RoDiMuS-X> Step through it using a Debugger it will make sense
[19:21:04] <fission6> i just did a test, a cookie is simple not set if i do the following option: use_html5_location: true,
[19:21:16] <fission6> then i // use_html5_location: true, remark it out, and a cookie is set
[19:21:47] <fission6> i must really be missing something, because i don't see how a cookie is set if html_location() is run
[19:22:14] <RoDiMuS-X> html_location should be calling that gapi unless you have that set to false
[19:23:16] <fission6> RoDiMuS-X: only if there is an error
[19:23:27] <fission6> i dont see how you dont see that. or worse, i dont see that.
[19:25:19] <RoDiMuS-X> no function(err) doesn't mean error
[19:27:27] <fission6> im not sure we have our facts straight here, ill have to wait to ask more people.
[19:28:13] <RoDiMuS-X> function(err) is used for error handling but doesn't mean it is an error
[19:28:43] <RoDiMuS-X> its like function(base){ print base;} will print what is passed
[19:29:08] <RoDiMuS-X> you could add in there alert(err) to see what is being passed to the function
[19:29:48] <fission6> well, there is no cookie being set when the https://github.com/codejoust/session.js/blob/master/session.js#L272 successfully returns a location, i can't put it any other way, and in my opionion the code shows just that
[19:31:37] <fission6> here is a nother way to ask my question to you then since you think the html5 location is being set in a cookie
[19:32:01] <fission6> show me what line it uses the returned value from getCurrentPosition to set a location cookie
[19:33:17] <RoDiMuS-X> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1140089/how-does-an-anonymous-function-in-javascript-work
[19:34:23] <fission6> im not 100% convinced you know what your talking about, no offense, but ill look for another opinion.
[19:34:54] <fission6> i feel you are guessing at things. and the anonymous function above doesn't have any relevance
[19:35:38] <RoDiMuS-X> sure it does because you think the function(err) only executes when there is an error
[19:36:12] <RoDiMuS-X> modules.gapi_location()(callback);
[19:36:19] <RoDiMuS-X> call back is defined on 273
[19:36:32] <RoDiMuS-X> which is the result of the position
[19:39:11] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use resource view in fullcalendar?
[19:46:25] <t_p> http://pastebin.com/KVnNvWEM
[19:46:32] <t_p> can anyone help me with this
[19:46:45] <t_p> I don't know what's this synatx mean
[19:47:00] <t_p> var chat = {}  (func)(chat);
[19:47:52] <coldhead> t_p: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[19:47:57] <t_p> what do the two brackets mean
[19:49:26] <Eviltwin> The var chat = {}; is a separate statement from the (function(context) { ... })(chat);
[19:53:25] <t_p> coldhead, your link is very useful
[19:53:27] <t_p> thanks
[19:59:34] <fission6> so i am not sure Rhodeium was very accurate before
[20:00:16] <fission6> sorry RoDiMuS
[20:09:39] <igcewieling> I am using jQuery, don't know if the question is spefiic to jQuery or not.  Is it possible to have the data from an ajax call with type: 'script' be run "on the fly" like can happen in an iframe (i.e not wait for the ajax all to compllete before running the code received so far).  If so what terms would I google for.  I'm finding nothing useful on google.
[20:12:33] <Eviltwin> So you mean a script that's going to not finish loading?
[20:12:42] <Eviltwin> But you want to start running as soon as possible?
[20:14:58] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: I am monitoring the status of phones.  I'm currently using an iframe with <script> tags to run javascript sent by the CGI script on the server.
[20:15:25] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I think that's the only consistent way to do what you're trying to do
[20:15:49] <igcewieling> This works great, but the "spinner" on the window spins forever.  I've seen various methods of making the spinner stop when using ajax calls, but none to do that with iframe AND chrome
[20:16:19] <igcewieling> I don't need to be crossbrowser, this is an internal application and we only support Chrome.
[20:17:38] <Eviltwin> You could look at WebSockets
[20:17:42] <Eviltwin> I think Chrome supports thost
[20:17:43] <Eviltwin> those*
[20:17:43] <zduffy> I am using .insertbefore to stack a div onto of another div. the second div slides in, and the first div stacks on top like it is suppose to until the second div is finished sliding and then the second div goes onto of the first div. Why?
[20:17:53] <Eviltwin> But your server needs to be configured to work with it
[20:19:22] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: thanks
[20:20:00] <igcewieling> AHA!  I found something useful.
[20:21:04] <igcewieling> if (xhr.readyState == 4) {          processEvents($.parseJSON(xhr.responseText));
[20:21:21] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[20:22:16] <igcewieling> is there some way I can say "here is a string with javascript in it, run it"?
[20:22:33] <zduffy> Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/UAJdC/
[20:22:34] <Eviltwin> Uh... it's usually not a good idea
[20:25:30] <igcewieling> I'll live with the forever running spinner for a while longer
[20:26:04] <Eviltwin> Does it happen if you add the iframe after load?
[20:26:16] <Eviltwin> Dynamically create the iframe and add it to the body?
[20:27:49] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: from my reading that method works with FF, but not chrome.  I can give it a try though.
[20:28:47] <Eviltwin> An iframe within an iframe? :D
[20:28:59] <igcewieling> recursive iframes!
[20:31:37] <Eviltwin> IFRAMECEPTION!
[20:33:09] <igcewieling> When I add "solved" to my searches all I get are pages with "Here is how you solve it for WW and IE, but I could not figure it out with webkit based browsers".
[20:40:06] <Attmattic> TypeError: a.replace is not a function what does this mean I been searching for it all day.
[20:40:17] <steveoliver> I'm using the Cycle plugin and exploring the options (http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/options.html).  I'd like to know if anyone knows how to define some of these options - i.e. 'animIn' is described as "properties that define how the slide animates in" but I'm not sure how those properties should be defined.
[20:41:03] <steveoliver> Attmattic: a.replace seems to exist as a property of a, but it is not a function, it may be a string or other type ?

[20:44:02] <Attmattic> Im porting code over from a weekcalendar to fullcalendar.
[20:44:21] <steveoliver> Attmattic: I'm hoping you post error code next
[20:44:24] <Attmattic> my events arent loading but Im getting json back
[20:44:36] <steveoliver> I'm sure not gonna read your whole script
[20:44:44] <Eviltwin> Attmattic: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide48
[20:44:57] <Eviltwin> Figure out what part of your code is causing the error to happen
[20:46:15] <Attmattic> im not as familiar with firebug but does read highlighted code mean anything?
[20:46:36] <steveoliver> Attmattic: dude, you gotta have tools
[20:46:36] <Eviltwin> Please read through these slides starting at the first one
[20:46:42] <Eviltwin> It will give you a good introduction
[20:46:50] <Eviltwin> And save you countless hours of debugging in the future
[20:48:25] <Attmattic> well i think it has a problem with the id that is coming in.

[20:48:48] <Eviltwin> And save you countless hours of debugging in the future
[20:59:51] <Attmattic> eviltwin I spent a few minutes reading your slides. It didnt do much good for me half understood it. Instead I found a Special Char in my Db that was causing the issue..
[21:01:06] <Attmattic> But thank you for your help..
[21:02:41] <Attmattic> im really just learning jquery.
[21:04:37] <shoky> steveoliver: go through the demos of jquery cycle, they have examples there for all the options
[21:05:00] <shoky> e.g. animIn is here http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/adv.html
[21:05:05] <steveoliver> shoky: yeah, i just found them at http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/adv.html
[21:05:11] <steveoliver> yeah, thanks
[21:05:34] <steveoliver> i'm just discovering all these options -- so sweet!
[21:25:48] <wingy> is it possible to use jquery mobile for desktop as well?

[21:51:32] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i've created an 'invite by email' module for my site.. but I feel its very basic and I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with such a thing
[22:20:46] <pts\3> i'm appending to a serialized array, but it just returns "undefined" .. please help me :( http://pastie.org/4508083
[22:22:11] <jrockjiggz> i'm trying to use .scrollTop, but $(this) in context is actually breaking the script.  how can I get the context of selector?    $('#'+targetId).show().append(el).scrollTop( $(this).innerHeight() );
[22:22:59] <Cork> pts\3: try to reproduce the problem in jsfiddle and post that
[22:23:21] <jrockjiggz> pts\3: push({ add: 'me' })
[22:23:25] <pts\3> Cork: will do. not super sure how ajax and all works there
[22:23:35] <Eviltwin> var target = $('#' + targetId); target.show().append(el).scrollTop(target.innerHeight()); ?
[22:23:44] <Cork> jrockjiggz: both are fine
[22:24:03] <pts\3> nothing changed from that jrockjiggz , nice thought though
[22:24:28] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin: yup :) ty
[22:24:29] <Cork> js doesn't care if you use a string as a key
[22:25:53] <jrockjiggz> pts\3: serializeArray() would not be an array anymore but a string
[22:26:18] <Cork> jrockjiggz: wrong, your thinking of serialize()
[22:26:27] <jrockjiggz> lol..
[22:26:34] <pts\3> serializeArray might be a bunch of objects or something?
[22:26:48] <Cork> its an array of arrays or an array of objects
[22:26:51] <Cork> don't remember
[22:26:59] <pts\3> console.log shows object Object a lot
[22:27:02] <Cork> pts\3: anyway your code should work
[22:27:11] <pts\3> well, that's some small consolation
[22:27:22] <jrockjiggz> pts\3:  values['add'] = 'me';
[22:27:25] <Cork> pts\3: but what i meant is create a jsfiddle with some input hidden or something in a form
[22:27:43] <Cork> jrockjiggz: its an array, you shouldn't use keys on it
[22:27:47] <pts\3> jrockjiggz: tried that without dice
[22:27:56] <pts\3> mine is associative ,, so an "object" probably?
[22:27:59] <Cork> pts\3: then serialize it and do your adding
[22:28:05] <Cork> pts\3: then post the link here
[22:28:06] <jrockjiggz> values[values.length] = { add: "me" };
[22:28:19] <Cork> jrockjiggz: and thats the same as .push
[22:28:34] <Cork> pts\3: that way we can test the problem and not guess
[22:28:43] <jrockjiggz> yea i'm just guessting ;P
[22:28:45] <pts\3> Cork: im ajaxing the form, printing $_POST from php
[22:28:56] <Cork> pts\3: in real life ya
[22:29:05] <Cork> pts\3: but you only need to reproduce a form
[22:29:20] <Cork> pts\3: it doesn't even have to be the same content
[22:29:34] <Cork> pts\3: its a test of serializeArray and appending to it
[22:29:39] <Cork> not ajax :)
[22:30:30] <pts\3> working on it Cork
[22:31:10] <pts\3> well it works on jsfiddle
[22:31:29] <pts\3> http://jsfiddle.net/P24GS/
[22:31:43] <pts\3> oh wait no it doesnt
[22:32:00] <pts\3> i need to make it be name: "bar", value: "poo"
[22:32:52] <pts\3> minimal test case tooo the rescue. thanks Cork
[22:34:20] <Cork> pts\3: and there you have it why i asked you to do it your self :)
[22:50:38] <zapsoda> http://pastebin.com/GA5rDdBn <---- thats the head of ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout im trying to get this to work http://www.gayadesign.com/diy/queryloader2-preload-your-images-with-ease/ any ideas why its not loading the loading page until its about half done loading?
[22:54:27] <zapsoda> ?
[22:59:09] <Cork> zapsoda: the scripts is loaded sync and your waiting for dom ready
[22:59:31] <Cork> zapsoda: so everything will be loaded before you bind queryLoader
[22:59:41] <Cork> except the background image
[22:59:46] <zapsoda> How could i fix that?
[23:01:13] <Cork> zapsoda: from the fairly small spage you have there isn't much you can do
[23:01:40] <Cork> zapsoda: you can push scripts thats not needed at the beginning to the end of your body
[23:01:49] <Cork> but thats about it
[23:02:02] <Cork> zapsoda: btw <body class="content";> isn't valid
[23:02:19] <zapsoda> no ;
[23:02:27] <zapsoda> did i have a ;   ?
[23:02:40] <Cork> you have one ywa :)
[23:02:45] <Cork> *ya
[23:02:49] <zapsoda> Oh ty
[23:03:03] <zapsoda> is there anyother way i could preload the page before displaying?
[23:03:28] <Cork> what is it you want to preload?
[23:04:21] <zapsoda> Mainly the background image
[23:04:30] <zapsoda> or just make the eniter site load
[23:04:34] <zapsoda> then display it
[23:12:40] <zapsoda> grrr is there any way i could get this site to load the entire background image before displaying
[23:14:02] <Cork> zapsoda: you need to wait for page load
[23:14:09] <Cork> before showing the page
[23:14:13] <Cork> that should suffice
[23:14:30] <zapsoda> Ok, how do i do that?
[23:15:00] <Cork> well you could show a hover screen on dom ready
[23:15:04] <Cork> and hide it on page load
[23:16:00] <Cork> $(function(){ /* display the loading screen */ }); $(document).load(function() { /* hide it */ });
[23:17:53] <zapsoda> what about $(#container).css("display", "none")              ?
[23:17:56] <cdaringe> $( "html" ).css("visibility","hidden"); ma work
[23:18:01] <cdaringe> zaps, too fast!
[23:18:24] <MichMich> $(#container).hide() doesn't work?
[23:18:29] <zapsoda> yha but my code is prob full of sytax errors :P
[23:18:38] <tw2113> so fix them
[23:18:55] <zapsoda> Well MichMich just pointed out .hide would work
[23:18:59] <zapsoda> and is better :P
[23:19:49] <Cork> zapsoda: just make sure that you don't hide the page statically and show it through js
[23:19:59] <Cork> that would mean the page is unreadable for none js users
[23:20:03] <Cork> and thats... bad
[23:20:11] <zapsoda> Ok :)
[23:20:49] <zapsoda> Heres what i have
[23:20:49] <zapsoda> <script type="text/javascript">
[23:20:50] <zapsoda>   $(function(){
[23:20:50] <zapsoda>     $(#container).hide();
[23:20:50] <zapsoda>   });
[23:20:50] <zapsoda>   $(document).load(function() {
[23:20:51] <zapsoda>     $(#container).show();
[23:20:53] <zapsoda>   });
[23:20:55] <zapsoda> </script>
[23:21:58] <cdaringe> hey guys: i could use some debuggin' tips.  footie.cdaringe.net.  i've got some slider checkboxes on the right.  only some seems to actually initiate, and i'm trying to troubleshoot, but not getting anywhere!  tips?
[23:22:33] <Cork> zapsoda: you need a string around the selector
[23:22:51] <zapsoda> thank you
[23:24:16] <zapsoda> Its not working its being really wierd: http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/
[23:27:42] <ckwalsh_> I'm trying to use a jquery module for showing timestamps, which replaces special tags/attrs with pretty timestamps. However, some of these tags are being loaded via ajax, and thus when the initial call after ready() is missing them. I think I have to use on() to attach to future events, but I'm not exactly sure how. Any help?
[23:27:58] <cdaringe> zapsoda: change the .load to .ready.  i just tested it on my server. it works.
[23:28:34] <zapsoda>   $(document).ready(function() {
[23:28:34] <zapsoda>     $('body').show();
[23:28:34] <zapsoda>   });
[23:28:35] <zapsoda> ?
[23:29:21] <cdaringe> line 20:  $(document).load(function() {  -->   $(document).ready(function() {
[23:30:03] <Cork> cdaringe: no you don't want ready
[23:30:10] <zapsoda> it stil ils not working for me :( http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/
[23:30:14] <Cork> that would defeat the whole purpus
[23:30:24] <zapsoda> What would?
[23:30:34] <zapsoda> Oh
[23:30:36] <Cork> using ready instead of load
[23:30:40] <zapsoda> Ok
[23:30:46] <Cork> ready is triggered when the dom is built
[23:30:47] <zapsoda> so i should put it back to load?
[23:30:58] <Cork> load is when the dom is build and all media is loaded
[23:31:04] <Cork> yes
[23:31:19] <cdaringe> ah, oops. sorry zapsoda. i didn't read the full dialog
[23:31:22] <zapsoda> What is onload?
[23:31:32] <zapsoda> Np cdaringe thanks for trying :)
[23:31:35] <Cork> its the old dom1 inline version of .load
[23:32:26] <zapsoda> Now it doesnt load at all :/ http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/
[23:32:43] <Cork> $(function(){}) is the exact same thing as $(document).ready(function(){}) so that make the action a bit weird
[23:33:32] <Cork> ah, you can't hide the content you want to render
[23:33:47] <Cork> that will prevent it from being rendered :)
[23:33:58] <Cork> you need to put a screen ontop of it
[23:34:01] <zapsoda> what about $(#container).css("display", "none")
[23:34:30] <zapsoda> and $(#container).css("display", "block")
[23:34:38] <Cork> your loading the css in #header thats inside #container so nope
[23:35:01] <Cork> display: none; is what .hide() does
[23:35:08] <zapsoda> Ok
[23:35:16] <zapsoda> so what do you think i should put there?
[23:35:27] <Cork> you need to construct a loading screen
[23:35:46] <Cork> that is a div that you put fixed or absolute and cover everything with it
[23:36:07] <Cork> then when the page is loaded you hide it
[23:36:39] <Cork> though that said that only works if what your seeing is a loading delay
[23:36:54] <Cork> if its rendering cause the image takes a while to render, there isn't much you can do
[23:37:10] <zapsoda> Thats the problum
[23:37:16] <zapsoda> the image takes for ever to load
[23:37:20] <Cork> cause modern browsers won't try to render the image until its shown
[23:37:40] <zapsoda> and i want it to be hidden until its ready
[23:37:41] <Cork> they will even discard the rendered copy if its not shown
[23:37:49] <Cork> can't really do that
[23:37:52] <zapsoda> :(
[23:38:34] <Cork> you could try interlacing the image
[23:38:55] <Cork> that might make it less "blinky"
[23:39:02] <zapsoda>  can you preload the image so the site wont load
[23:39:03] <zapsoda>  until its loaded?
[23:39:20] <zapsoda> Not at all? :/  :(
[23:39:39] <Cork> that only handles the loading into memory
[23:39:44] <Cork> the rendering happens later
[23:40:21] <Cork> browsers doesn't convert the ex. .png or .jpg file into a bitmap until the area where its used is shown
[23:40:43] <Cork> and if that takes a little to do it will blink
[23:41:33] <cdaringe> Cork--you're a knowledgeable gent.  would you mind takin' a peek @ my link for a few secs?
[23:41:54] <zapsoda> Thanks for your help Cork
[23:41:57] <zapsoda> :)
[23:42:23] <coldhead> flattery will get you everywhere
[23:43:02] <Cork> zapsoda: this is really why you want to use image tiling
[23:43:22] <zapsoda> Whtats that?
[23:43:27] <Cork> zapsoda: that meas the browser only have to decode a small image and can then use that to render indefinitly big areas
[23:43:28] <zapsoda> What is*
[23:43:33] <Cork> zapsoda: repeating images
[23:43:39] <zapsoda> oh
[23:43:45] <zapsoda> i know what repeating images is
[23:43:55] <Cork> its called image tiling
[23:43:58] <zapsoda> i just didnt match it to tiling in my brain
[23:44:23] <Cork> cause you build it like the tile on a roof
[23:45:51] <Cork> cdaringe: check so the selector you use matches all the element you want
[23:46:23] <Cork> cdaringe: though what slider doesn't work?
[23:46:48] <cdaringe> do they all work on your end?  in firefox they all work, but in chrome they are unhappy. there's only a single div selector
[23:54:57] <bigLanky> anyone konw of a carousel or imageflow slider that i can do this with? http://screencast.com/t/szwejJxkW
[23:55:06] <bigLanky> i basically have 5 links that i need to wrap around
[23:55:34] <bigLanky> i have found a few imageflow plugins but they all require images to work
[23:56:22] <Cork> cdaringe: btw your doctype is invalid you should prob fix that
[23:56:45] <cdaringe> Cork--hmm ill take apeek
[23:57:20] <Cork> cdaringe: invalid as in xhtml with the memetype text/html
[23:57:39] <Cork> cdaringe: use <!doctype html> or mimetype application/xhtml+xml
[23:57:55] <Cork> (warning though xhtml isn't supported in ie<9
[23:57:57] <Cork> )
[23:58:38] <Cork> cdaringe: and fix the validation errors and see if that helps
[23:58:38] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffootie.cdaringe.net%2F&doctype=HTML5&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.3
[23:59:01] <Cork> (it should has you have nesting errors)
[23:59:41] <cdaringe> i grabbed that original doctype from w3 schools, but i have no reason to hold back to html4
