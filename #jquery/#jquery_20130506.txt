[00:00:04] <Cork> Leentje: it does here
[00:00:46] <domino14_> javascript: urls don't seem to pop up alerts anymore
[00:00:51] <domino14_> javascript:alert("Hello World") doesn't work as a URL
[00:02:24] <leeyo> what are your thoughts <Cork> ?
[00:03:38] <Cork> leeyo: on what?
[00:04:16] <leeyo> <domino14>'s question
[00:04:48] <Cork> that the question is hard to answer
[00:05:19] <Cork> the browser tries to block these things and i'm no browser security expert
[00:06:06] <leeyo> I am not sure if he's just trying to putting a value to the attribute src thru user input
[00:06:16] <leeyo> *put
[00:06:23] <Cork> he's looking for xss exploits
[00:06:29] <leeyo> ah i see
[00:06:39] <Cork> to make sure the site isn't vulnerable
[00:06:48] <leeyo> not familiar to those. I better zip it ;)
[00:06:53] <Cork> but the best place to check that is before it's appended
[00:11:16] <wilkinsmc> is it more efficient to remove a class on mouse leave or every time a mouse isn't on a position
[00:11:26] <wilkinsmc> i have a bunch of if else statements
[00:12:24] <Cork> leeyo: http://jsfiddle.net/pjZDp/
[00:12:55] <Cork> wilkinsmc: the adding and removeing the class isn't that important
[00:13:07] <Cork> what matters is when it triggers a reflow on the page
[00:13:31] <Cork> you want as little reflow as possible, cause that is the most expensive job the browser does
[00:14:00] <Cork> domino14_: http://jsfiddle.net/pjZDp/
[00:14:19] <Cork> domino14_: that is the kind of problem you need to look out for
[00:16:15] <domino14_> Cork: i tried this: $('a').append($("<img/>", { src: 'javascript:alert(%27hello%27)'}));
[00:16:29] <domino14_> and it doesn't pop up an alert. that's what i'm worried about right now, how do i determine if that jquery function is safe
[00:16:52] <Cork> uh img
[00:16:57] <Cork> totally missed that
[00:17:08] <Cork> i don't think the browser allows scripts in img urls at all
[00:17:52] <Cork> so as long as there isn't a way to escape out of the string it should be fairly safe
[00:18:23] <Cork> ('<img src="' + url + '>') would be exploitable
[00:19:34] <Cork>  var url = '"><script>run your javascript here</script><span id="'; target.append('<img src="' + url + '">');
[00:19:39] <Cork> *opps* :)
[00:20:22] <domino14_> Cork: that's what it used to be, but then I changed it to $("<img/>", {src: url})
[00:20:28] <domino14_> i'm trying to determine if that's exploitable
[00:20:30] <domino14_> ^
[00:20:49] <Cork> it does dom manipulation, so no you can't create dom elements through it
[00:21:19] <Cork> $("<img/>", {src: url}) becomes var img = document.createElement('img'); img.src = url;
[00:21:36] <domino14_> http://jsfiddle.net/pjZDp/2/
[00:21:57] <domino14_> so what's that mean?
[00:25:14] <sacho> domino14_, append() isn't the same thing.
[00:25:23] <Cork> domino14_: it means that the image isn't loading and the error callback is fired
[00:25:33] <Cork> and prompt is triggered
[00:25:55] <domino14_> no i know what that means..
[00:26:03] <domino14_> i'm just trying to figure out if $("<img/>", {src: url}) is exploitable
[00:26:06] <domino14_> that's all
[00:26:10] <Cork> then you need to start typing out your questions...
[00:26:12] <domino14_> i can't figure out how to exploit it
[00:26:22] <Cork> not why ask unended questions
[00:26:48] <Cork> domino14_: for an img tag it would be quite hard
[00:26:55] <Cork> and it would be a bug in the browser if you could
[00:27:05] <Cork> the problem is more likely to be somewhere else
[00:29:12] <sacho> domino14_, jquery isn't writing html directly - you're not vulnerable to an escaping issue.

[01:11:53] <quietschie> hi, i have a general question: is it possible to show (and change) all functions that are registered with any event on an element?
[01:12:15] <Cork> not really
[01:12:30] <Cork> you can remove all event listeners through .off()
[01:12:49] <Cork> but there isn't really a supported way to get what listeners there are
[01:13:09] <Cork> there is an internal way to get it, but it normally breaks with each new version of jquery
[01:13:24] <Cork> currently its $._data(element, 'events')
[01:13:57] <quietschie> ok, the problem is, that i clone(true) sth, that has had events, but the references don't match
[01:14:21] <Cork> so the script is written the wrong way :/
[01:14:50] <Cork> (obstructively instead of unobstructively)
[01:14:51] <quietschie> which script?
[01:15:05] <Cork> the functions that works on the element's you clone
[01:15:30] <Cork> if they don't work on the cloned element it means the script isn't written in a way that works based on the element
[01:16:01] <quietschie> ok
[01:17:12] <quietschie> then i have to find another way :)
[01:17:21] <quietschie> thanks for the info
[01:40:49] <MindSpark> hi, I am using datepicker more as a calendar. I kind of made the date fields much bigger and now I want to add meta information to each day. Such as images and text. However, it seems to me that the click handling function depends on the content of the table data cell.
[01:40:57] <MindSpark> Does anyone know a workaround for this?
[02:26:15] <jop008> lawnchair tooling
[02:26:34] <jop008> I want to look in my tables easily how can I arrange this?
[02:28:00] <jop008> is there some tooling like this json => table
[02:28:12] <sunbeam> hi, i am trying to post an array with $.post
[02:28:18] <sunbeam> should it be converted to some data type?
[02:32:38] <Cork> sunbeam: just do { arr: array }
[02:32:49] <Cork> jquery will do the rest
[02:32:56] <Cork> if the array is long though; you might want to use json
[02:33:08] <Cork> { json: Json.stringify(array) }
[02:42:10] <jop008> can you filter in json with >
[02:43:07] <Cork> uh, you mean css filter a json object?
[02:43:14] <Cork> no, you can't
[02:43:43] <Cork> if you parse the json string to a javascript object you can just reach into it though
[02:45:53] <jop008> found some code
[02:46:16] <jop008> I want to see what is in my lawnchair tables
[02:47:01] <wodim> hello, how do i receive html markup (and not the plain text only) when someone pastes it in a <textarea>?
[02:48:46] <Cork> wodim: you could try with onpaste, but i don't think you can cross browser (yet)

[03:05:28] <Lucaszz> hi
[03:06:00] <Lucaszz> I have an object with that poperty
[03:06:05] <Lucaszz> 'function-name'
[03:06:12] <Lucaszz> How to get that poperty value?
[03:06:22] <Lucaszz> object.finction-name - its wrong syntax
[03:06:29] <Lucaszz> object.'finction-name' - its wrong syntax also
[03:07:48] <seutje> widoz: using jQuery UI by any chance?
[03:08:18] <seutje> Lucaszz: object['function-name']
[03:08:43] <seutje> objects can be addressed as arrays, sorta, kinda
[03:08:52] <Lucaszz> ok thank you :)
[03:09:17] <seutje> js> var foo = { 'some-thing': 'bingo!' }; print(foo['some-thing']);
[03:09:19] <b-ot> seutje: bingo!
[03:30:22] <sunbeam> Cork: thanks
[03:30:39] <sunbeam> Cork: and then send arr?
[03:30:55] <Cork> sunbeam: no just give $.post that new object
[03:31:17] <Cork> $.post('url', { arr: array }) (or JSON.stringify())
[03:31:27] <Cork> jquery will convert it into a param string
[03:31:39] <Cork> arr[]=v1&arr[]=v2&arr[]=v3 and so on
[03:32:12] <Cork> $.post('url', { json: JSON.stringifty(array) }) becomes json=<json encoded string>

[03:36:59] <Lucaszz> how to transform Date object to string
[03:36:59] <Lucaszz> ?
[03:37:54] <Cork> toString()?
[03:38:02] <Cork> or do you mean format the output?

[04:20:05] <patstoms> I need a chart with timeline where I can show some statistics
[04:40:29] <jeffszusz> hey guys; i'm writing a jquery-ui widget; I'm allowing the user to provide a callback function in the options; how do I go about allowing access to object members from within the callback in options?
[04:43:14] <Cork> jeffszusz: you could pass this to the callback, or you could create a separate object with just the functions you want to expose
[05:00:51] <peiper> i'm echoing some data from a utf8 mysql table (php), in my browser it appears to be right but in an $.ajax() response i see weird characters, whats the matter?
[05:01:00] <peiper> i've set the header everywhere manually wo utf8
[05:05:06] <`e> hi
[05:05:18] <`e> is it possible to call different instances of jstree on the same page?
[05:05:38] <`e> on different div
[05:05:53] <`e> *divs
[05:06:19] <fabioportieri> how do you instantiate the jstree?
[05:06:43] <Lucaszz> What is the best way to draw tables (<table>) by jquery
[05:06:48] <Lucaszz> ?
[05:06:49] <seutje> peiper: are you utf8_encode()-ing the response?
[05:07:15] <Lucaszz> I can just put someDiv.append('<td>'+value+'</td>')
[05:07:24] <Lucaszz> or I can use JsRender
[05:07:49] <Lucaszz> (or another js templates)
[05:08:01] <`e> fabioportieri, italiano?
[05:08:02] <Lucaszz> but it not work correctly in all browsers
[05:08:13] <Lucaszz> what do you think
[05:08:14] <Lucaszz> ?
[05:08:34] <peiper> seutje, yes, it returns ü's as Ã¼
[05:08:42] <fabioportieri> yes `e
[05:08:57] <`e> anyway, I'm trying to instantiate two (maybe in the future tree) instances of jstree to load different trees with data from different json results
[05:10:07] <fabioportieri> `e: i don't know that jstree but i bet it does something like $("element").jstree(); , so in this case you just need to adjust the selector
[05:10:39] <`e> sì, ma ne carica solo una, l'altra la legge in html per un attimo e poi scompare
[05:11:37] <fabioportieri> it disappears? :|
[05:11:50] <`e> ho <div parent> e i due div figli: stList e metaList, la prima jstree la istanzio in stList e la seconda in metaList, la prima funziona, la seconda non la rendera
[05:12:14] <`e> direi di più, non la rendera e scompare
[05:13:14] <fabioportieri> mm paste code
[05:14:56] <`e> http://jsfiddle.net/MyWEX/
[05:15:25] <`e> don't run code, it needs jstree plugin and json source
[05:17:00] <fabioportieri> `e: second div is empty, maybe the plugin requires additional markup, like in the first div?
[05:17:19] <xfire> `e: credo che qui devi tradurre in inglese
[05:17:42] <`e> xfire, ya no problem :)
[05:18:55] <`e> fabioportieri, the first div load data from a json source, the second (metaList) load the data inside the div
[05:19:18] <`e> is it right how i instantiate the two jstree() ?
[05:22:56] <fabioportieri> i would try putting some list inside your second div too
[05:24:48] <hxm> i have a menu with a <ul> and various links treated as buttons, i want to fade all divs and so the div linked to clicked <li>
[05:24:57] <hxm> and using <a id="button" works only with the first one
[05:24:59] <hxm> how to do it?
[05:25:20] <seutje> IDs are inherently unique
[05:25:34] <fabioportieri> use a class
[05:26:27] <hxm> right now i have this $( "#button" ).click(function() {, change it for .button?
[05:26:52] <peiper> .click is deprecated by the way
[05:28:02] <mg983> Howdy all
[05:28:15] <hxm> right, works, thanks fabioportieri
[05:28:22] <hxm> peiper: what is the new way then?
[05:28:26] <peiper> hxm .on
[05:28:32] <fabioportieri> click is fine
[05:28:45] <fabioportieri> is a shortcut for .on("click",...
[05:29:40] <peiper> oh lol, sry then
[05:31:29] <okdamn> http://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=1779959601
[05:31:56] <okdamn> ;)
[05:33:47] <Cork> peiper: no it's not
[05:33:58] <Cork> oh, already been said
[05:37:36] <mg983> Questionâ€¦ I'm trying to trace an error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" on http://popdust.com << the stacktrace only takes me through jquery libraries â€” no code that is specific to the siteâ€¦ how would I go about troubleshooting it?
[05:40:13] <fabioportieri> hard to say since it's all minified
[05:40:39] <Ungy> I have bound a click function on a label the event works in FF but in chrome it defaults back to the default behavior of the labels click by selecting the associated form input. has anyone else experienced this? I am using jQuery 1.9.1 by the way
[05:40:44] <mg983> fabioportieri: But.. is it an issue with jquery libraries and no code specific to the site?
[05:42:33] <Ungy> also IE 10 works as well so it seems to be a chrome thing
[05:45:38] <mg983> fabioportieri:  i think I see the issue, there's an older version of jquery enqueued
[05:45:51] <fabioportieri> good
[05:46:00] <fabioportieri> it's probably that
[05:46:41] <Ungy> ahh I see I have to preventDefault
[05:53:35] <jop008> I do a #.get and an error occured but alert("An AJAX error occured: " + status + "\nError: " + error + "\nError detail: " + xhr.responseText); brings nothing
[05:53:54] <jop008> how to debug this?
[05:56:06] <xec_> jop008: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide3
[05:57:58] <jop008> I know debuggers
[05:58:14] <jop008> but this is ajax <-> client thing
[05:58:34] <xec_> Y U alert() ?
[05:58:44] <Ungy> jop008 you have trouble hitting f12 in your browser
[06:00:29] <Ungy> jop008 and use if(console) {console.error("An AJAX error occured: " + status + "\nError: " + error + "\nError detail: " + xhr.responseText); } not alert
[06:00:40] <jop008> mac chrome
[06:00:50] <Ungy> then you can use that nice console thing in your browser
[06:00:55] <Ungy> it's amazing
[06:00:58] <xec_> cmd+alt+i ?
[06:01:06] <xec_> anyway
[06:01:18] <xec_> jop008: we need (a lot) more information, preferably accompanied with some live (running) code
[06:01:48] <Administrateur> hi
[06:01:48] <xec_> jop008: what happens, under what circumstances, and what did you expect to happen instead?
[06:02:12] <Ungy> jop008 modern browsers have lots of nice debugging stuff built right in
[06:02:38] <Ungy> so you can see your post and response believe it or not
[06:02:43] <jop008> happens all the time
[06:03:18] <Ungy> I prefer using firefox and firebug personally I am most familiar with it
[06:03:32] <jop008> when I use the url I got data from php server and it is valid json
[06:03:42] <Guest41787> any one is free... i need some help
[06:03:47] <Guest41787> :(
[06:03:52] <xec_> ?ask @ Guest41787
[06:03:52] <b-ot> Guest41787: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:05:22] <Guest41787> i need to catch html element changes even the page is loaded is that possible?
[06:05:23] <jop008> rhia is my url
[06:05:30] <jop008> this is my url http://localhost:8080/altenaontw/index.php?-action=showtable&table=lbk&datetime=2013-05-06%2012:00:00
[06:05:39] <jop008> returns valid json data
[06:05:45] <xec_> jop008: localhost? :)
[06:05:48] <jop008> so what can be wrong
[06:05:59] <jop008> yes of couse local development
[06:07:09] <xec_> jop008: what is the error? what is the code? any chance you can host it somewhere so we can see the issue first hand?
[06:07:20] <jop008> there is no error
[06:07:25] <xec_> yay
[06:07:27] <xec_> fixd.
[06:07:39] <jop008> on rthe screen
[06:07:50] <jop008> jquery-1.9.1.min.js:5
[06:08:02] <jop008> is on the console with the url
[06:08:09] <jop008> the url in red
[06:08:28] <jop008> when I open in new tab the url I got the server answer
[06:08:59] <xec_> http status code?
[06:09:10] <jop008> not reported
[06:09:35] <jop008> $.ajaxSetup({ "error": function (XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {
[06:09:35] <jop008>     console.log("Ajax setup json error " + textStatus) + "\nError: " + error;
[06:09:36] <jop008>   }
[06:09:37] <jop008> });
[06:09:43] <xec_> i believe in chrome you can right click in the console and switch on xhr reporting
[06:09:43] <jop008> throws no info
[06:10:01] <xec_> that looks like a syntax error to me
[06:10:24] <jop008> a syntax error I can handle
[06:11:21] <xec_> anyway, you shouldn't need anything like that to debug ajax. did you go through the slides i linked you to earlier? slide 33+ is quite useful http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide33
[06:11:36] <jop008> yep
[06:11:42] <Ungy> console.log("Ajax setup json error " + textStatus + "\nError: " + error);
[06:11:45] <Ungy> wtf
[06:11:55] <jo__> G'morning #jQ.
[06:11:58] <xec_> do you see the http request under network tab?
[06:12:06] <xec_> yo, jo__
[06:12:25] <jop008> setting breakpoints never succeeded
[06:12:41] <xec_> no breakpoint needed (so far)
[06:12:42] <jop008> the debugging is not that intuitive like vba debugging
[06:13:06] <xec_> did you find the network tab in the chrome developer tool thing?
[06:13:06] <jo__> I had a similar problem on Friday.  Couldn't hit breakpoints in FF.
[06:14:00] <fabioportieri> source tab for breakpoints
[06:14:29] <xec_> fabioportieri: i'm trying to see if he can find the http (ajax) request
[06:14:33] <jop008> when I use the debugger what is one step ahead?
[06:14:44] <kba> I'm trying to access `this.container` from within the droppable-closure, so I bind it at `cont`, but somehow that completely changes the meaning of `this` within the scope. http://paste.debian.net/2414/
[06:14:51] <xec_> if it is stopped? the next statement
[06:15:03] <fabioportieri> xec_: i usually click the request popping up in the console and go from there
[06:15:05] <jop008> yes go one line ahead
[06:15:12] <kba> Could somebody have a look at that? It's just a few lines. As you can see, I bind cont, but afterwards `console.log(this)` seems to be referring to `cont`.
[06:15:30] <kba> When I print `this` at least, it returns the contents of `cont`.
[06:16:00] <xec_> fabioportieri: i'm not sure if mac chrome displays all the http requests in console by default (i know theres an option for it)
[06:16:58] <kba> That was a sloppy bunch of code. Look at this http://paste.debian.net/2415/.
[06:17:04] <jop008> I used ajax earlier succesfull now with extra param errors
[06:17:07] <kba> Why does this refer to cont suddenly?
[06:17:10] <xec_> kba: it changes from line 7 to 10 ?
[06:17:28] <kba> xec_: Look at the new paste.
[06:18:52] <xec_> kba: you're explicitly setting  'this' to cont by using bind() (or am i missing something?)
[06:19:30] <kba> xec_: Oh, that's how .bind() works. Okay, then. How would I go about just accessing this.container from within the closure?
[06:19:47] <xec_> just use 'cont' ?
[06:20:04] <xec_> bind docs btw: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[06:20:36] <jop008> the error is here jquery-1.9.1.min.js:5
[06:21:10] <xec_> jop008: line numbers in minified files are less than useful, and most likely it's a case of garbage in, garbage out
[06:21:25] <kba> xec_: I feel silly. Yes, obviously that's what I should do. Thanks ;-)
[06:21:31] <Ungy> jop008 that would be a very long line and near impossible to debug given it's minified nature
[06:21:47] <jop008> remove min.js
[06:21:53] <jop008> and change it to js
[06:22:09] <Ungy> if it is a local file get teh uncompressed version
[06:22:34] <xec_> jop008: renaming it won't unminify :P
[06:22:44] <Ungy> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js
[06:22:50] <jop008> no of course that one
[06:22:54] <Ungy> that is the uncompressed version
[06:23:07] <xec_> and the error still points to line 5? which is what?
[06:24:05] <xec_> if you make the debugger halt on errors, you might be able to step out to see the calling code. if it is an ajax callback, however (which i assume) you might not ;)
[06:24:12] <Ungy> OK well I can see the direction this is going.
[06:24:26] * xec_ hugs Ungy
[06:27:03] <jop008> failed to load resource
[06:28:06] <jop008> no jquery error anymore

[06:30:46] <Ungy> I am thinking we need a term like script kiddies for people who reuse libraries with no idea what they are doing
[06:31:14] <Z3R0> libkids
[06:31:25] <myosotis> better than writing a library when they have no idea what they're doing?
[06:31:39] <Ungy> myosotis well I do that all the time ;-)
[06:32:09] <seutje> just make sure to write it to be re-usable, and then never use it again!
[06:32:30] <myosotis> that sounds oddly familiar
[06:32:36] <Ungy> or make it so convuluted noone can figure out what it is doing
[06:33:36] <jop008> this is the error line 				xhr.send( ( s.hasContent && s.data ) || null );
[06:33:42] <jop008> in jquery
[06:34:00] <jop008> line 8526
[06:34:03] <sacho> And the error is?
[06:34:19] <jop008> no error
[06:34:28] <magnus__> hey. lets say i have a table with a button on each row. i would like, when any of the buttons are clicked, all buttons become disabled until a certain action is completed. I have assigned a "click" handler to all buttons, but now I need a way to disable the "other" buttons. jquery selectors might help here? not sure how that selector would look, and how i would later on do the .attr('disabled', true) on them?
[06:34:30] <seutje> oh, and while ur at it, make sure all function names are localized in some obscure language spoken by a handful of ppl
[06:34:31] <jop008> get in red
[06:34:37] <sacho> <jop008> this is the error line     xhr.send( ( s.hasContent && s.data ) || null );<jop008> no error
[06:34:48] <kzurawel> magnus_: sounds like you need event delegation
[06:34:55] <jop008> but there is not a type of errror
[06:35:16] <kzurawel> instead of assigning a click handler to each button, assign a click handler to the table that listens for clicks on each button
[06:35:19] <jop008> only a red get is in the console with an error line
[06:35:31] <seutje> magnus__: $('.button').not(this).attr('disabled', true); ?
[06:35:47] <seutje> this being the one being clicked on
[06:35:50] <xec_> jop008: obviously, jquery is not the source of your problem, there's something wrong with your ajax request. what does your code look like?
[06:36:03] <jop008> I do a pastebin
[06:36:05] <magnus__> seutje, excellent. does this imply my buttons all need to have "class=button"
[06:36:09] <kzurawel> Something like   $('#thetable').on('click', '.tablerow', function() {})
[06:36:40] <kzurawel> magnus_: inside your handler function, do your test to see whether or not $(this) is active. But use .on() - will save a lot of memory and make your page faster
[06:36:51] <seutje> magnus__: yeah, replace it with whatever selector matches the buttons, like $(this).closest('table').find('.button').not(this)
[06:36:55] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/XpWpG6WQ
[06:37:12] <seutje> that would first go up to the table, find all .button elements and exclude the one being clicked on
[06:37:33] <Qdest> var controller = $(el).find(options.control); <-- I don't want to search the el scope for options.control, I simply want to 'add' it to the selection. However, when using add() I'm getting el + options.control seperately instead of el.options.control ==> I'm getting #selection and #selection .something with add instead of #selection .something.
[06:37:38] <magnus__> seutje, the buttons are created dynamically, so they dont really have an ID or something. I do however have a reference to the table jQuery object. is it possible to just select all buttons (of any kind) that are children of the table?
[06:37:50] <kzurawel> magnus_: .on() will do that.
[06:38:02] <sacho> Qdest, you're "getting" that how exactly?
[06:38:17] <kzurawel> .on() is a replacement for .live() / .delegate(), so it works well with things that are added dynamically to the page
[06:38:22] <xec_> jop008: if you put a breakpoint on line 10 and 13, are any of them ever reached?
[06:38:29] <seutje> magnus__: "buttons of any kind" being <button></button> and <input type="submit" /> ?
[06:39:05] <magnus__> seutje, yes, i do var b = $('<button/>'); b.on('click', function() { ... } ); and then mytable.append(b);
[06:39:05] <seutje> in that case $(this).closest('table').find('button, input[type="submit"]').not(this)
[06:39:20] <seutje> magnus__: oh, u already have a reference
[06:39:22] <Qdest> sacho: Well, I'm passing el and options to a function where el is the element of which the plugin is called wheras options is the options set. Anyhow, one option is .control, and the element in question is .fan.selector so basically what I want is .fan.selector .control (which works with .find).
[06:39:27] <seutje> b.not(this) ?
[06:39:29] <magnus__> i do not have any submit
[06:39:36] <jop008> no 10 13 not reached
[06:39:53] <sacho> Qdest, please provide a test case.
[06:39:58] <xec_> jop008: did you refresh the page between?
[06:40:03] <seutje> magnus__: I'm confused, why not add a single handler to the entire table?
[06:40:05] <jop008> yep
[06:40:15] <jop008> and update my manifest file
[06:40:21] <Qdest> sacho: @sliderToggler and @sliderControl
[06:40:32] <magnus__> seutje, hm, explain? i do not want the action when my table is click, but rather each individual buttons?
[06:40:41] <sacho> I've no idea what that's supposed to mean.
[06:41:12] <seutje> $('table').on('click', 'button', function(e) { $(e.target).closest('table').find('button').not(e.target).attr('disabled', true); }); ?
[06:41:43] <xec_> jop008: ok, then that's not the ajax call you're looking for. if it was, it would either trigger success (10) or error (13)
[06:41:45] <seutje> magnus__: this binds a single handler to the table and checks if the element being clicked was a button, if so, it'll run the handler
[06:42:02] <seutje> `g javascript event delegation
[06:42:03] <b-ot> seutje: How JavaScript Event Delegation Works - David Walsh â†’ http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate
[06:42:16] <magnus__> seutje, oh, okay. i did not realize you could pass another criteria (that it is a button) to the table handler
[06:42:16] <jop008> so what can it be?
[06:42:19] <xec_> jop008: does it work if you move it out of a loop and simplify it with a static url etc?
[06:42:20] <seutje> magnus__: check that article when u got a spare minute
[06:42:35] <magnus__> thank you
[06:42:41] <seutje> magnus__: it's how .on() works and how .delegate() used to work (albeit reversed_
[06:42:46] <seutje> s/_/)
[06:42:57] <xec_> jop008: (http requests in a loop looks like a huge design flaw to me anyway)
[06:43:25] <Qdest> sacho: You see what I mean? If I use $(el).add(options.control); it would mean ".fan.selector" and ".fan.selector .control" instead of only the latter
[06:43:48] <sacho> No, I don't see what you mean, which is why I asked for a test case.
[06:43:51] <seutje> xec_: isn't that how long polling works?
[06:44:09] <seutje> or do u mean like 17 being initiated at the same time?
[06:44:13] <jeffszusz> I am building a widget: right now it is intended to target a table row, but almost all of the functionality happens on the table cells; each cell has to be aware of its' neighbor though. should I refactor it to be put on the table element, or on a td element, or leave it operating on the tr?
[06:44:18] <Qdest> sacho: Oh, I missed to paste the fiddle...
[06:44:19] <xec_> seutje: http://pastebin.com/XpWpG6WQ
[06:44:35] <Qdest> sacho: http://jsfiddle.net/2b3GK/13/
[06:44:37] <jop008> why not multiple request per mysql table
[06:44:51] <jop008> *programming is with loops
[06:44:54] <xec_> seutje: actually it just checks if 0 is less than 1 ?!
[06:45:00] <seutje> jeffszusz: table cells can't rly exist without rows, which in term can't rly exist without a table, so I guess it makes sense?
[06:45:20] <xec_> jop008: on second thought, what on earth is that for loop for?
[06:45:39] <seutje> xec_: LOLWAT?!
[06:46:00] <jop008> request data per table and save it with lawnchair
[06:46:06] <xec_> seutje: yeah i just had a WAT moment myself
[06:46:22] <seutje> jop008: should it be i<nlen by any chance?
[06:46:49] <seutje> that length doesn't seem to be used anywhere
[06:47:01] <xec_> yeah, gotta be
[06:47:10] <jeffszusz> seutje: there's really no interaction between rows so I don't feel it needs to be attached to the table, and there -is- interaction between td's so it makes sense to have it attached to the tr. my problem is that I need the td's to be aware of each other and to be able to target the td itself, the 'next' one and the 'previous' one, all from a user-defined callback.
[06:48:06] <seutje> jeffszusz: prev() and next() can handle that, no?
[06:48:32] <jeffszusz> seutje: yes, if the object selected is a td
[06:48:50] <jop008> w o the loop same problem with a static url
[06:49:05] <jeffszusz> but my widget is on a tr, so i need to be able to specify that each td is eqal to, say, the 'next' one times 5 for example.
[06:49:13] <sacho> Qdest, I'm still not completely sure what you want, but maybe it's $(el).add($(options.control, el))
[06:49:27] <jeffszusz> but that needs to be exposed as something the user can define
[06:49:36] <jop008> now the error is on the 13 line
[06:49:40] <xec_> jop008: you could test it directly in console, with something like $.getJSON('api/question/13').done(console.log).fail(console.error)
[06:49:58] <xec_> well, replace the url with your own
[06:50:29] <Qdest> sacho: If you scroll down the code to sliderScroll: and insert that code var controller = $(el).add($(options.control, el)); and hit run, press "down" once and check the console
[06:50:55] <jeffszusz> inside some of my methods attached to the widget, I can target a td based on what the user is editing, but I'm not sure how to tell a callback defined in "options" to refer to each individual td as 'this'.
[06:51:30] <xec_> jop008: and inspect the http headers
[06:51:35] <Qdest> What happens is I get multiple results and a whole lot of debugging data which isn't related to what I'm doing hence the selection is doubled. It listens on el AND el+options.control. If you change the line back to .find(options.control) it "works" like I want it to. Although I don't want it to have to search the scope
[06:51:41] <Qdest> @ sacho
[06:52:20] <sacho> Well, of course it listens on both.
[06:52:22] <jop008> on the console same error
[06:52:32] <sacho> That's what happens when you add further elements to the collection which has el in it.
[06:52:36] <sacho> el doesn't vanish.
[06:53:06] <jop008> get in red and 8526 jquery message
[06:53:18] <Qdest> No it doesn't, but I want to narrow the selection down to ".fan.selector .control" which would be theoretically $(el + options.control) but that won't work. I'd like to "merge" it somehow
[06:53:50] <sacho> What's wrong with using find there?
[06:53:59] <Qdest> $(".fan.selector .control").on(...) is basically what I want, but without being that specific (making use of the defined el and options.control)
[06:54:08] <jop008> i<1 is for testing only
[06:54:17] <jop008> if it works I change it
[06:54:18] <Qdest> sacho: afaik, find on el would search the entire .fan.selector for .control
[06:54:41] <sacho> as opposed to ".fan.selector .control", which will search the whole .fan.selector for .control.
[06:54:58] <Qdest> really? it's the same thing?
[06:55:14] <sacho> What makes you think it's different?
[06:55:22] <Qdest> THen I'll absolutely use find, I just figured it would use more resources than add()
[06:55:37] <sacho> "parent descendants" <-- space means descendants of parent
[06:56:21] <sacho> if you want to create one less jquery object, which is quite the microoptimization, you could use $(options.control, el)
[06:56:47] <sacho> (which means search for selector param1 in context param2
[06:56:52] <Qdest> Basically I though being specific, like $('.fan.selector .control') wouldn't result in a search but rather a specificity of a certain assumed element whereas I thought .find('.control') would search, from top to bottom in parent for .control which would take more resources.
[06:57:21] <Qdest> Thank you for clarifying sacho, a lot :)
[06:57:40] <sacho> $('.fan.selector .control') would even be more work. First it has to find the .fan.selector matching elements(which you already have). Then it has to search them for .control descendants.
[06:59:09] <Qdest> sacho: Ahh, I get it. Thank you! $(param1, param2) was exactly what I wanted to use. Searching for param1 in param2. But essentially that is identical to $(param2).find(param1)?
[06:59:40] <sacho> Pretty much.
[07:00:54] <jop008> So what can I try to find this nasty bug?
[07:02:31] <Ungy> jop008 I recommend you learn how to use a javascript debugging utility
[07:03:30] <jop008> Thanks fellow
[07:04:31] <Ungy> jop008 you need to make sure your post is correct then check to see the return all modern browsers on the desktop have this ability
[07:05:45] <Ungy> jop008 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1535462/debug-xhr-in-chrome-browser/1591333#1591333
[07:05:51] <Ungy> google is your friend
[07:07:29] <jop008> when I copy code that is working to my lib it also fails
[07:07:51] <jop008> makes it a difference that it is from a catched file?
[07:08:40] <Ungy> holy crap dude you obviously want us to solve your problem for you. Myself and others have led you to the water dude drink or die.
[07:28:14] <jop008> Can you run ajax form catched pages?
[07:35:14] <Trudko> Guys by anychance do you know how to set default sort for whole table in jquery using tablesorter plugin? I only found how to set sorting for each column separately
[07:39:27] <BillCriswell> Trudko: It should sort the rows as well.
[07:40:06] <Trudko> ou ok will test
[07:41:49] <Ungy> jop008 what is a catched page? did you mean a cached page? If you did a cached page is just css js and images stored locally all external calls woudl be handled the same. Unless you are modifying the js images and or css on page creation
[07:42:10] <Wolf_22> Is there a specific port .ajax uses?
[07:42:31] <Wolf_22> Never mind... Dumb question--it's 80 as it uses HTTP... Sorry.
[07:43:17] <zissou> i have a div filled with content. on some event, contents get deleted and new content inserted. this process looks ugly cause i can see a part from old content when new one is being inserted
[07:43:20] <Ungy> unless it is https then it uses 443
[07:43:46] <Ungy> zissou check the order of operation
[07:44:07] <Qdest> sacho: are you around still?
[07:46:31] <zissou> Ungy, tnx
[07:52:18] <Wolf_22> Is there a way to test .ajax() with Firebug? (I.e. - I'd like to insert a simple console.log for a variable inside a script, but I haven't found a way to do this with Firebug.)
[07:54:27] <BillCriswell> Wolf_22: Just type $.ajax('foo.php') into Firebug.
[07:54:56] <Symbi0nt|GER> does anybody knows how I can use the javascript debugger in chrome? The "Scripts" Tab seems to be gone.

[07:55:09] <Symbi0nt|GER> :-/

[07:57:28] <bnason> I'm using JQueryUIs dialog() and it works fine in chrome, however in IE9 it replaces the whole page with "[object Object]" anyone have any idea why?
[07:58:06] <zissou> i need a var from one function in another. do i use global or user js to write to superglobals?
[07:58:08] <Wolf_22> Here's the thing: I've got a link that's supposed to log you out of the interface I'm working on, which submits an .ajax call within a DoLogout() function. The function accepts "true" as a parm, and calling this function directly in the console works, but when I try to use the link (which uses .ajax), it doesn't. Any ideas where I should start? What kind of server configurations are needed...
[07:58:10] <Wolf_22> ...to support .ajax? (Going to go look right now at the jQuery page.)
[07:58:43] <darkmutt> what's a a#id selector in jquery?
[07:58:53] <BillCriswell> snagnever: It's the same as #id.
[07:59:01] <BillCriswell> Just limits it to <a> elements.
[07:59:13] <BillCriswell> The a is completely useless.
[08:10:35] <Ungy> zissou you cannot pass it?
[08:10:41] <Ungy> that is a better practice

[08:17:02] <TeraJL> how can i have an on "keydown" , even on elements created later?
[08:17:44] <fabioportieri> TeraJL: .on()
[08:17:49] <zissou> Ungy, at first i thought i couldn't because the target func doesn't come right after the first one and gets called when a button is clicked which is loaded initially but hidden. i unhide it with first func and realized that i can attach the event to call 2nd func here. also i realized that info which i needed is still in selection_option.val. so no need for (super)globals ;)
[08:18:31] <TeraJL> fabioportieri: i'm using on, but it's not working
[08:18:37] <Ungy> zissou ahh scoping is fun
[08:19:00] <fabioportieri> TeraJL: sorry my mistake
[08:19:22] <TeraJL> probably the mistake is mine
[08:19:24] <zissou> TeraJL, put it in some div and use delegate()
[08:19:27] <fabioportieri> delegate()
[08:20:09] <fabioportieri> why am i reading "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method"
[08:20:39] <fabioportieri> on doesn't match future elements, so...?
[08:21:39] <jop008> if my lib is at ./include/lib.js how can I refer to root files like ../?
[08:21:46] <kzurawel> fabioportieri: on is a replacement for delegate
[08:21:54] <kzurawel> it will match dynamically-added elements
[08:22:06] <fabioportieri> kzurawel: but it doesn't say so in the doc
[08:22:30] <fabioportieri> it says .on doesn't match future elements, delegate() does
[08:23:37] <kzurawel> fabioportieri: Ok, I get what you're saying. If you attach the .on() to a container element, though, it will process events for dynamically-added children
[08:23:55] <dcherman> fabioportieri: yes it does - it depends on what arguments you pass to .on per the docs
[08:23:57] <zissou> fabioportieri, there is a section about delegation in .on() documentation. as far as i can tell. you just use .on on a created parent container and it gets called on its descendants
[08:24:44] <fabioportieri> so, .on use delegation but only for his children?
[08:25:07] <fabioportieri> not for the directly matched selector?
[08:25:41] <kzurawel> fabioportieri: here's an example.   I've got this html:   <ul class="big list"> <li></li>  <li></li> </ul>
[08:25:47] <kzurawel> I want a click event on the li's
[08:25:50] <TeraJL> i have $(".email").on("keydown keypress",function(e) { console.log("poke");});    if i do $(".email") on the chrome console i get 2 inputs, but if i press on the input, only the "html-created" element is calling the console.log();
[08:26:11] <kzurawel> So I use $('.biglist').on('click', 'li', function() { // do something });
[08:26:38] <kzurawel> If I add more li's into the list later, they will still get the click events because the only thing listening for the clicks is the outer ul, which existed when I called $().on()
[08:26:48] <fabioportieri> kzurawel: and that will be the same of $('.biglist li').delegate('click') ?
[08:26:56] <kzurawel> I think so, yes
[08:27:00] <fabioportieri> i see
[08:27:08] <fabioportieri> TeraJL: you following?
[08:27:14] <TeraJL> thanks kzurawel
[08:27:19] <kzurawel> np
[08:27:33] <TeraJL> it's working now, as $("form").on( "keydown keypress",".email",function(e){...
[08:29:40] <fabioportieri> great
[08:29:45] <fabioportieri> bye bye see tomorrow
[08:31:35] <darkmutt> how without the usage of id's would i select the children of the currently clicked element??

[08:36:58] <monk12|2> hello all, curious... what if someone put an ajax request in their javascript code ... that happens on document.ready?

[08:37:48] <monk12|2> i saw a function that returns the result of an ajax POST in a function... so that ajax request happens before the document is loaded and is gaurenteed to be ran before the document is loaded i beleive.
[08:38:30] <monk12|2> i usually see ajax requests after the document has loaded, based on an event. not in the actual document.ready. so wasnt sure.
[08:38:37] <sunbeam> if i do array[i]['something'] = 1;
[08:38:40] <sunbeam> do i need to declare
[08:38:44] <sunbeam> array[i] = [] ?
[08:38:45] <BillCriswell> I always forget about $.grep dammit.
[08:38:47] <Z3R0> of course you can do ajax on load
[08:38:54] <Z3R0> suppose you want to fill a table with information...
[08:39:10] <Z3R0> you wouldn't wait for a use to click a button that says "show me data"
[08:40:02] <monk12|2> yeh, i mean usually id expect the server-side componant to already create that table when user lands on it. seems unusual to create content via JS on load.
[08:40:20] <kzurawel> monk12|2: happens a lot when you don't control the data, a third party does
[08:40:21] <Z3R0> well ya...
[08:40:30] <Z3R0> just saying
[08:43:03] <darkmutt> sorry kzurawel wrong question to be exact i'd like to select a set but not all the children of the parent element of $(this)
[08:43:34] <kzurawel> so something like $(this).siblings('selector')?
[08:43:43] <TeraJL> some knows the browsers compatibility of using $.ajax to upload files?
[08:44:09] <BillCriswell> Is there a function like .map() that  I can also filter out elements or do I need to mix $.map and $.grep?
[08:45:49] <BillCriswell> I guess I'll just use a for loop lol.
[08:46:01] <Z3R0> wait what?
[08:46:03] <Z3R0> BillCriswell has a question ?
[08:46:39] <BillCriswell> Z3R0: I can usually figure out how to do something, it's always the most ideal way I struggle with.
[08:46:49] <Z3R0> yea
[08:46:52] <darkmutt> while did that solve an issue and worked like a charm (why don't i usually think of the simplest solutions is beyond me) it seems to have eaten my css bit but ill fix that
[08:46:55] <Z3R0> make it work is one thing... optimize is is another
[08:47:43] <ctienrsg_> As I constantly try to improve my jquery, I am able to finish try-jquery and codeschool-tutorials but still I don't feel very familiar with it. Should I try to work with a good book in addition?
[08:47:58] <BillCriswell> Z3R0: I'm thinking a for loop is my best bet. $.grep( data, function(el){ }).map(function(el){ }) isn't very pretty.
[08:49:13] <RNT> anybody a solution for this:
[08:49:15] <RNT> $('#list').on('mouseleave', '.class_1', function(){
[08:49:15] <RNT> alert($test); // TODO
[08:49:15] <RNT> }).on('mouseenter', '.class_1', function(){
[08:49:15] <RNT> var $test = 'TEST';
[08:49:15] <RNT> });
[08:49:55] <darkmutt> RNT, please do try to provide a jsbin instead of making a mistake i did and spamming a bit, thank you :)
[08:50:10] <RNT> i know, but it was very short
[08:50:24] <darkmutt> check the alert line then
[08:50:50] <RNT> won't return nothing
[08:50:51] <Z3R0> @ BillCriswell well... ur knowledge VAST exceeds mine
[08:51:15] <BillCriswell> Z3R0: You'd be shocked I'm sure!
[08:52:10] <Z3R0> @ BillCriswell by how big your brain is?
[08:52:23] <RNT> in 'mouseleave' won't recognize the var defined in 'mouseenter'
[08:52:25] <RNT> :-?
[08:52:47] <clov3r> RNT: define it outside the mouseleave
[08:52:48] <RNT> i'm doing something wrong?
[08:52:55] <Ungy> RNT scope dude
[08:53:02] <Ungy> declare the variable outside
[08:53:06] <Ungy> then set it inside
[08:53:14] <RNT> >:D<
[08:53:14] <Ungy> then it will be available
[08:53:21] <RNT> thx
[08:53:35] <BillCriswell> Z3R0: It's only like.... 5% filled.
[08:54:01] <Ungy> scope problems are so damn common with JS
[08:54:22] <Ungy> people do not understand what var implies
[08:55:07] <dwarder> what is the way to substitute $('.myclass').children().children() ?
[08:55:20] <BillCriswell> dwarder: .find()
[08:55:37] <Ungy> var globalvariable; function test() { var privatevariable; }
[08:55:42] <Z3R0> @ BillCriswell unless the children aren't all the same element
[08:56:00] <BillCriswell> dwarder: Are you trying to limit it to just 2 elements deep?
[08:56:22] <Ungy> dwarder if you know what type of children you can use a selector
[08:56:23] <BillCriswell> Z3R0: Not sure I'm following that haha
[08:56:31] <Z3R0> well...
[08:56:47] <Z3R0> <div> <div> </div> <ul> <li> </li> </ul> </div>
[08:56:51] <dwarder> BillCriswell: thanks, find is gooood
[08:56:56] <Z3R0> first div children = <div> and <ul>
[08:57:12] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:57:19] <Ungy> find is slower then children if you can specify
[08:57:20] <Z3R0> so you can't find(<div> and <ul>) ?
[08:57:41] <dwarder> ohh right, selector ..
[08:57:58] <dwarder> thank you guys
[08:58:16] <BillCriswell> Z3R0: Why couldn't you?
[08:58:25] <Z3R0> how?
[08:58:41] <Z3R0> and what if the types are dynamic lol ;)
[08:58:46] <Ungy> .children("ul li")
[08:59:12] <Ungy> you guys are confusing me
[08:59:33] <Z3R0> I'm just saying that children() will return a collection, when the elements may not be of the same type...
[08:59:34] <Ungy> Z3R0 and BillCriswell you too are way beyond me
[08:59:52] <Z3R0> so you can't simply state I want to find all ('div') if the collection objects might be more than just 'div'
[09:00:12] <BillCriswell> Z3R0: I'm following you now. You can technically do $('div').find('> *') though ;)
[09:00:34] <Ungy> I was just about to say that
[09:00:41] <Ungy> ugly and slow as hell
[09:01:38] <BillCriswell> If it's insanely deep and there's thousands probably, most cases you'll never notice.
[09:02:26] <BillCriswell> Depth wouldn't matter now that I think about it.
[09:04:15] <sunbeam> if i do array[i]['something'] = 1;
[09:04:16] <sunbeam> do i need to declare
[09:04:19] <sunbeam> array[i] = [] ?
[09:04:35] <kzurawel> sunbeam: give it a try in a browser's javascript console and see if it gives you an error
[09:04:46] <kzurawel> My guess is yes, you do
[09:05:06] <BillCriswell> I second the yes.
[09:05:11] <hxm> if i have a <ul> and each <li> contains a click event for hide a list of divs, how can i know which <li> is executing the function?
[09:05:34] <BillCriswell> hxm: You can get the index of it or some other identifier.
[09:05:35] <Ungy> $(this)
[09:05:38] <sunbeam> kzurawel: im debugging for hours now
[09:05:44] <sunbeam> kzurawel: i dont see what i do wrong
[09:06:16] <Ungy> hxm $(this) will reference the object calling the click
[09:06:17] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: array[i] = {}; is what you proably want.
[09:06:57] <sunbeam> var array[i] = {}
[09:07:00] <sunbeam> this is somehow wrong
[09:07:04] <sunbeam> var array[i] = {}; i mean
[09:07:14] <Ungy> why is that wrong?
[09:07:28] <dcherman> Ungy: sunbeam because `var` is invalid in that position
[09:07:34] <dcherman> just use array[ i ] = {}
[09:07:41] <sunbeam> dcherman: ok
[09:07:47] <sunbeam> i thought i needed to declare arrays as var too
[09:08:03] <Ungy> it is already declared
[09:08:07] <dcherman> you're not declaring the array, you're trying to set a property/index of the array
[09:08:09] <Ungy> no?
[09:08:10] <dcherman> two different things
[09:08:22] <sunbeam> ok i start with
[09:08:26] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: var items = new Array(5); items[3] = {}; items[3]['something'] = 'WHOOOAAA';
[09:08:28] <dcherman> if you haven't declared it yet, then declare the array, THEN set whatever you want
[09:08:37] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: thanks, why Array)5) ?
[09:08:41] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: thanks, why Array(5)
[09:08:52] <BillCriswell> That's just so I don't have to create 5 empty elements.
[09:09:05] <Ungy> BillCriswell I thought new Array() is bad you should use []
[09:09:07] <BillCriswell> Probably don't need to do that.
[09:09:09] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: but i dont know how much elements its going to have
[09:09:29] <BillCriswell> It works with just 5
[09:09:40] <BillCriswell> I was just being precise.. wasn't sure how it was going to work.
[09:10:01] <dcherman> BillCriswell: it would worth without doing that.  it's called a sparse array.
[09:10:03] <dcherman> work*
[09:10:14] <BillCriswell> var items = []; items[3] = {}; items[3]['foo'] = 'Foooooo';
[09:10:17] <BillCriswell> works the same.
[09:12:58] <BillCriswell> dcherman: I figured. Thanks!
[09:18:29] <roger_padactor> So firebox doesn't like myst $.post response that is json  firebug sees that its json but FF has it as undefined.  anyone else have this problem
[09:18:55] <roger_padactor> $.post($("#emailForm").attr('action'),$('#emailForm').serialize(),function(data){
[09:18:56] <roger_padactor> 		console.log(data.response); });  returns undefined in FF  chrome works fine.
[09:20:18] <jop008> When I have my code in a lib toruble starts it seems like the php code can not be found
[09:20:34] <jop008> the php code is at index..php
[09:20:43] <jop008> in th eroot of the site
[09:21:04] <jop008> tha ajax call is from ,.i/nclude
[09:21:58] <RNT> new request :D
[09:21:59] <RNT> http://pastebin.com/amzHqaeS
[09:23:00] <TeraJL> how can i check if the mouse is hover an element? even if the there are other elements in front of it? (i've tried mouseout, with no luck ,and $(document).mousemove, and then .has(e.target) with no luck too because of the element in front)
[09:23:32] <jop008> when I put my lib in the root ajax is doing fine
[09:24:49] <roger_padactor> why can't i do data.response and get my json data in FF in chrome it works fine.
[09:25:49] <NoiseEee> roger_padactor: see if running it through parseJSON helps
[09:28:39] <roger_padactor> NoiseEee:  so why in FF do I have to do parseJson but not in Chrome?
[09:29:03] <NoiseEee> perhaps one of the browsers is more forgiving with the headers you're sending?  are you sending back correct JSON headers?
[09:29:19] <NoiseEee> roger_padactor: did that in fact solve the problem?
[09:31:11] <Ansikt> Anyone have a guess as to why this ajax doesn't work?  When I point it to a prexisting html file and comment out dataType, it gives me a success.
[09:31:12] <Ansikt> http://pastie.org/7809111
[09:31:46] <BillCriswell> Ansikt: It's probably the wrong http headers.
[09:33:24] <Ansikt> BillCriswell: I tried this and it still doesn't work.  I'm going to try and set the mimetype on apache....one sec
[09:33:25] <Ansikt> http://pastie.org/7809121
[09:34:57] <Ansikt> Apache is using "application/json json"  for that mimetype...looks correct
[09:36:18] <Ansikt> Is my json file improper? http://pastie.org/7809135
[09:36:24] <Ansikt> I get no warnings in FF console.
[09:36:35] <RNT> a tip for this guys please http://pastebin.com/amzHqaeS
[09:36:58] <kzurawel> Ansikt: could try pasting your JSON into http://jsonlint.com
[09:37:34] <clov3r> RNT... no need for the jquery selector on $($t).text... should be $t.text('ABC');
[09:37:34] <RNT> Ansikt, you have a double quota in the first line, may be this a problem?
[09:37:53] <RNT> clov3r, i'll try, thx
[09:39:00] <clov3r> RNT: yep, the jquery selector: $(...) searches the DOM (document object model) for elements matching the selector.
[09:39:49] <clov3r> you have already assigned the element you want to $t, so $t is already a reference to those elements.
[09:40:31] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/2xuWz/ - I have an input on Dialog UI box. How can i alert "N/A" if the input is blank and clicked continue?
[09:41:17] <Ansikt> RNT, kzurawel, BillCriswell:  Found it.  I was specifiying my server's domain name (localhost) in the url for ajax.  This was making the browser treat it as cross-domain for some reason.  Also, that json lint tool is really cool.  Thanks guys!
[09:41:35] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[09:45:19] <roger_padactor> NoiseEee: yeah it solved the problem.
[09:48:06] <TheGreekDoll> Greetings?
[09:48:38] <roger_padactor> NoiseEee:  I've never used it before. no idea why I have to now.
[09:49:45] <TheGreekDoll> Ok, so, I am examaning Jquery code and

[09:53:57] <clov3r> but yeah, for the most part jquery makes my life waaaay simple :D
[09:54:14] <clov3r> and the only problems i encounter are due to my own lack of knowledge
[09:55:49] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/2xuWz/ - I have an input on Dialog UI box. How can i alert "N/A" if the input is blank and clicked continue?

[10:18:49] <funhouse> Hi guys, just wondering what animation library you guys would recommend
[10:19:00] <funhouse> jstween looks good.
[10:22:15] <melkor> I have an [object htmlDivElement] I would like to find a nested div element with a specific class name. This object doesn't have find though, is there a way to use jquery to find the nested div?
[10:22:29] <slackz> When I click something and fire focusout, how do I eventually get the browser to process the click? Such as, if focusout creates a dialog box with Yes / No, and a user clicks Yes, then the original item clicked for focusout to fire is "clicked".
[10:25:20] <mashlol> melkor: $(yourDiv).find(".yourClass");
[10:25:28] <mashlol> where yourDiv is the [object htmlDivElement]
[10:27:09] <relipse> can someone please help me fix my jquery dialog:  http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/ login as: test_test_test user:admin  pw: testtest
[10:27:17] <melkor> Thank you. Should have been obvious, I was thinking the [object ...] was already some sort of jquery object.
[10:27:40] <RNT> for a xmlhttp does anybody knows an answer?
[10:27:41] <RNT> http://pastebin.com/WFVSYgRA
[10:29:17] <sunbeam> hi, i'd like to offer a client a download file
[10:29:28] <sunbeam> after he clicked on a link that posts something
[10:29:30] <sunbeam> any idea how I Can do this?
[10:30:24] <relipse> sunbeam: form.submit();
[10:30:52] <relipse> you can use ajax too
[10:31:21] <relipse> <a href="myfile.zip" onclick="$.post(...) return true;">
[10:31:34] <sunbeam> relipse: thats not what i mean
[10:31:38] <sunbeam> relipse: in php i generate a file
[10:31:42] <sunbeam> that i like to offer
[10:32:07] <funhouse> anyone?
[10:32:59] <relipse> sunbeam: i have no idea what you are talking about
[10:33:09] <relipse> you are in a jquery channel
[10:33:10] <relipse> why?
[10:33:16] <kzurawel> funhouse: what do you want to do with an animation library?
[10:33:52] <sunbeam> relipse: because i dont know how to offer it as a result of $.post
[10:34:29] <relipse> why not just use <form><input type=submit></form> then?
[10:34:48] <relipse> when the user clicks submit it goes to next page where you have download
[10:35:02] <relipse> if you want to use ajax, thats fine, use $.post()
[10:35:09] <relipse> look in jqueryui dialog
[10:35:15] <relipse> err look in jquery docs
[10:35:21] <sunbeam> relipse: i use $.post
[10:35:35] <sunbeam> and i dont want the page to redirect/refresh
[10:35:36] <relipse> ok so whats the problem, you post to a page and then you can do window.location.href = 'blah'
[10:36:06] <relipse> so catch the results inside the callback function and display a link to download
[10:36:13] <sunbeam> ohh i can do that as the function() in $.post right?
[10:36:25] <relipse> yes look up docs
[10:36:29] <sunbeam> ok hanks
[10:36:30] <sunbeam> thanks
[10:36:33] <relipse> sure
[10:37:21] <funhouse> kzurawel: rotations, circular tweening.
[10:37:30] <funhouse> greensock looks pretty good
[10:38:44] <kzurawel> funhouse: the library you go with depends a lot on what you want to do. If you're going to animate DOM elements, you could just go with CSS3 animations (they support most of what you're looking to do). If you're using Canvas, maybe something like easel.js
[10:39:37] <kzurawel> CSS3 animations are nice too because the browser pushes them off to the graphics card instead of running them in the main thread - you get more responsive animation, less stuttering
[10:40:31] <funhouse> kzurawel: ok will check out easel. thank you.
[10:46:21] <jo__> I've fiddled with Phonegap in the past and found the renderer they use to be kinda' slow, especially with canvas.  Anyone else feel the same way?
[10:47:42] <kzurawel> jo__: on iOS?
[10:47:49] <jo__> And Android.
[10:48:20] <kzurawel> for iOS at least, anything that's not Safari gets a slower renderer. No just-in-time JavaScript compiler because Apple thinks it's a security risk
[10:48:25] <kzurawel> Not sure why it would be slower on Android.
[10:48:29] <jo__> I had one simple app which just spun an SVG drawing in the center of the screen and it capped out at 20fps.
[10:48:48] <jo__> Cordova doesn't use native?
[10:48:59] <jo__> I guess I don't know how they do it.
[10:49:24] <kzurawel> It does, but the native component that it gets on iOS is a UIWebView, which is slightly different from the actual Mobile Safari browser
[10:49:38] <jo__> Oooh.
[10:49:43] <jo__> :( Darn.
[10:55:44] <wilkinsmc> does anyone really use safari?
[10:55:57] <kzurawel> I'm one of those weird people, yeah
[10:56:15] <kzurawel> Mainly because it doesn't have Flash installed. I just switch to Chrome when I need YouTube or some restaurant website
[10:56:54] <wilkinsmc> I'm guessing .2% of my customers will be using safari
[10:56:59] <wilkinsmc> haven't tried my website in it yet
[10:57:06] <wilkinsmc> getting it to work with IE and Firefox was a pain in the ass
[10:57:13] <kzurawel> If it works in Chrome, it's 99% likely it'll work fine in Safari
[10:57:16] <wilkinsmc> spent at least as much time optimizing for those two as making it in the first place
[10:57:39] <kzurawel> there are only a few minor differences, mostly with who decided to remove CSS3 prefixes when
[10:57:51] <wilkinsmc> the single biggest thing that blew my mind is that IE can't flip images with opacity horizontally without filling it all in with black
[10:57:56] <wilkinsmc> oic
[10:59:33] <wilkinsmc> seems like a pretty basic feature
[10:59:56] <kzurawel> You'd be surprised at what IE does and doesn't do right - it took them until IE10 to implement text-shadow.  ;)
[11:00:20] <kzurawel> That said, IE10 mostly does things right. It's a big improvement over 9
[11:04:54] <Baylor> I'm looking for a plugin that adds a pan-over zoom to an image. Like when you mouse over a product image on Amazon <http://amzn.com/B002RCQ6U2>
[11:05:25] <Baylor> Does anyone have a recommendation
[11:09:29] <Schonert> Hej guys. a whildcard for $('id').parent('a').is('img-*')
[11:10:30] <Z3R0> Baylor: http://www.ajax-zoom.com/index.php?cid=download ?
[11:11:00] <JosephSilber> Baylor, http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/featuredzoomer.htm
[11:11:15] <wilkinsmc> Baylor: pretty sure there's a JQ plugin for that

[11:20:06] <hxm> i wanted to hide every class="content" except which executed the event http://jsfiddle.net/AnGw6/
[11:20:10] <hxm> but all are hidden
[11:22:12] <kzurawel> hxm: there's nothing connecting your "buttons" to your divs
[11:22:20] <kzurawel> when you click a link, "this
[11:22:27] <sunbeam> how should I return data from php to $.post?
[11:22:27] <jo__> It took them until IE10 to get real Ajax support.
[11:22:29] <sunbeam> i mean, what format?
[11:22:31] <kzurawel> " is the link, so both divs are "not(this)"
[11:22:44] <jo__> @sunbeam Write a handler which will accept data as an argument.
[11:22:53] <hxm> so how to do it
[11:23:00] <hxm> using a id="" in each <li>?
[11:23:20] <kzurawel> you could add a rel="" attribute to each li
[11:23:25] <jo__> $.post("theDataToGet.json", function(myInboundData){ alert("This is a function which will do something with the data: " + myInboundData); })
[11:23:37] <kzurawel> the first link could be <a class="button" rel="content1">
[11:23:38] <jo__> Roughly.
[11:24:09] <kzurawel> then in your click handler, do $('.content').not('#' + $(this).attr('del')).hide()
[11:24:16] <kzurawel> gah autocorrect
[11:24:21] <kzurawel> $(this).attr('del')
[11:24:30] <kzurawel> $(this).attr('rel')
[11:24:32] <kzurawel> There we go.
[11:24:48] <jo__> @sunbeam The thing to note is that the post will continue IMMEDIATELY, so if you're waiting for it to complete before the next line, you're going to be in trouble.  Treat it like lisp or scheme or lambda calculus.
[11:25:03] <kzurawel> hxm: Does that make sense?
[11:25:27] <madprops> i'm trying to select a div by concatenating '#' and it's id which is "#demouser@localghost.webfactional.com&somedirectory/views.py"  i'm getting unrecognized expression error. Could that be because of the ampersand?
[11:25:55] <madprops> i'm not including the # in the id btw
[11:26:20] <jo__> I think the . is a reserved class descriptor.
[11:26:57] <madprops> you're right
[11:27:16] <jo__> I'm not sure how that will interact with a full identifier like that.
[11:27:47] <jo__> I'm going to copy and paste your ID into the interactive prompt and remove stuff until I narrow it down.  I invite you to do the same.
[11:27:52] <jo__> Tandem error checking!  :D
[11:28:18] <jo__> Oh hey.
[11:28:32] <jo__> Strange.  It accepts that ID.
[11:28:43] <jo__> @madprops, can you copy/paste the code chunk?
[11:28:56] <sunbeam> jo__: yes, thats what i do now
[11:29:02] <jo__> Cool.
[11:29:04] <sunbeam> jo__: but it is empty
[11:29:05] <hlve> how would you target a div that has a background color of red?
[11:29:06] <hlve> o_o
[11:29:13] <sunbeam> jo__: even though i do return "bla"; in php
[11:29:30] <jo__> @sunbeam It won't return anything.
[11:29:44] <jo__> It will call the function with "bla".
[11:29:50] <madprops> jo__,  nvm I changed the id to a number. But I can paste the code if you're interested in the problem
[11:30:05] <jo__> $.post("someData.json", theNameOfTheFunction);
[11:30:17] <jo__> @sunbeam in that post, someData.json will be just "bla".
[11:30:17] <hxm> kzurawel: im trying to get it and make it work
[11:30:30] <jo__> theNameOfTheFunction = function(data) { alert(data); }
[11:31:28] <kzurawel> hxm: I updated your fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/AnGw6/1/
[11:31:30] <kzurawel> Seems to work.
[11:32:35] <sunbeam> jo__: i have that
[11:32:41] <melkor> I have a string that contains the html to build a div element, is there a good way to construct that in jquery?
[11:32:50] <jo__> Huh.
[11:32:55] <hxm> what attribute is rel? really noob asking this
[11:33:22] <jo__> Can you make a jsfiddle with your server?  Or if it's localhost, can you make the Ajax call directly in your console?
[11:33:38] <jo__> If I'm having Ajax problems, I'll usually check the network tab in Chrome or Firebug.
[11:33:44] <jo__> That will tell me what I'm sending or getting back.
[11:33:48] <melkor> mystring = "<div class='some class'>more html</div>".
[11:34:03] <jo__> If the alert isn't even firing, it could be the call is failing completely.
[11:35:40] <kzurawel> hxm: 'rel' is an attribute that usually gets used for stylesheets (link rel=''), but you can put it on any HTML element
[11:35:48] <kzurawel> We're just using it here as a place to put that data.
[11:36:04] <kzurawel> If you don't need to support old IEs, it would probably be better to use a data attribute
[11:36:18] <kzurawel> http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/
[11:36:18] <hxm> ah ok, i thought was a jquery feature
[11:39:17] <liox_> hi
[11:39:47] <JosephSilber> kzurawel, what does old IE have to do with data-* attributes?
[11:40:04] <liox_> there is a way to assemble elements to append to be manipulated after documment ready?
[11:40:34] <kzurawel> JosephSilber: Not sure if IE6/7 support adding data-*
[11:40:46] <kzurawel> 8 does
[11:40:56] <NoiseEee> yes they all do, i mean technically it supports any attribute.
[11:41:04] <JosephSilber> kzurawel, Even IE10 doesn't support dataset
[11:41:13] <jo__> I think IE 6/7 will allow them as attributes, but don't have any special modifiers.
[11:41:31] <JosephSilber> jo__, neither does any other version of IE
[11:41:33] <jo__> Herâ€¦ what @noiseeee said.
[11:41:39] <jo__> *Ehr
[11:41:40] <kzurawel> True. Ok, hxm I think you should go with some kind of data- attribute instead of rel.
[11:42:32] <hxm> ok, i'll take a look at this
[11:42:48] <JosephSilber> You always do el.getAttribute('data-foo') or $(el).data('foo')
[11:42:58] <JosephSilber> I meant you CAN always do...
[11:43:59] <kzurawel> JosephSilber: but $().data isn't data-attributes, it's jQuery's own method of hacking data into the DOM. :)
[11:47:12] <jo__> I think $(foo).data('key', 'value') works across browsers as far back as IE.  Haven't tested it.
[11:47:23] <jo__> Just be sure not to mix $.data and $(ident).data.
[11:47:26] <jo__> I had problems with that.
[11:47:36] <jo__> Use $(foo).data('key')
[11:54:09] <jdalton> why should I use jquery when there is https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/jqLite.js
[11:56:10] <Ikzmol> Hey, i'm using a language switcher that uses jquery and I'm in need of a lil help. The js turns a form I have on my page into a dropdown list with all language options, but it's showing duplicate entires for the "selected" language.. I'd very much like to get rid of this, a template of the language switcher can be viewed at http://198.57.47.114/switch.html. I'd greatly appreciate any inputs on
[11:56:11] <Ikzmol> this
[11:56:21] <awc737> this is only alerting when the first element is clicked: this.$lvlOneNav = $('#header_inner, .nav_level1link');
[11:56:24] <awc737> #header_inner
[11:56:29] <awc737> when .nav_level1link is clicked, no alert
[11:56:35] <awc737>  this.$lvlOneNav.click(function(){          alert('clicked');
[11:57:52] <shoky> awc737: fiddle
[11:58:18] <awc737> k sho
[11:59:43] <JosephSilber> kzurawel, jQuery automatically imports data-* attributes into $().data()
[12:01:16] <awc737> darn, shoky it works here
[12:01:16] <awc737> http://jsfiddle.net/7ZJHY/
[12:01:20] <awc737> but not with my javascriptmvc app
[12:03:19] <thinkt4nk> awc737 did you copy/paste, or did you re-write?
[12:03:31] <awc737> thinkt4nk, had to sort of rewrite, because this. scope won't work
[12:03:43] <thinkt4nk> I'll bet it's a simple typo then
[12:03:53] <rb_mk> >> 'test'
[12:04:23] <awc737> ill show you the difference
[12:05:17] <awc737> shoky, thinkt4nk http://paste.laravel.com/qDF
[12:05:41] <awc737> js fiddle works, not my app
[12:06:29] <thinkt4nk> is init being called before document ready, and .nav-level1link element(s) are being created dynamically?
[12:07:37] <thinkt4nk> oh wait, .click is now a shortcut for on('click', nvm
[12:08:15] <awc737> perhaps
[12:08:35] <awc737> wierd thing is this works, (which is JavascriptMVC
[12:08:40] <awc737> ".nav_level1link click": function( ) {        alert('clicked')
[12:11:10] <sunbeam> window.location.href is what i use to forward to a file, is there also a way to force the user to download a file?
[12:13:56] <ebrooks> so i'm just scanning through bootstrap.js
[12:14:06] <ebrooks> and noticing that the global functions all return false
[12:14:22] <ebrooks> like !function($) {}(jQuery)
[12:14:27] <ebrooks> what's that about?  o.O
[12:15:27] <JosephSilber> It's equivalent to (function (){}())
[12:15:32] <JosephSilber> Just saving a byte
[12:15:56] <JosephSilber> It turns it into a function expression
[12:16:23] <ebrooks> so it just hacks a closure?
[12:16:42] <JosephSilber> Not sure what you mean by closure...
[12:16:49] <JosephSilber> Every function in JS is a closure
[12:17:02] <JosephSilber> If you mean an IIFE, then yeah
[12:17:06] <ebrooks> well how (function(){}()) is used to control scope, i mean.
[12:17:10] <JosephSilber> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[12:17:41] <ebrooks> ty for source.
[12:22:51] <sunbeam> window.location.href is what i use to forward to a file, is there also a way to force the user to download a file?
[12:23:17] <awc737> you were right thinkt4nk , elements were not ready yet
[12:24:21] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: same thing
[12:26:21] <sunbeam> how do you mean NoiseEee
[12:27:49] <NoiseEee> window.location.href = pathToFile;
[12:28:42] <awc737> can I do something like this?
[12:28:43] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/qDT
[12:30:07] <clov3r> maybe this? http://paste.laravel.com/qDU

[12:37:10] <Dorf> i'm trying to make a section of a form appear based on the selection of a dropdown list.  i've found some help, but i'm not sure what i should change to make it work. http://jsfiddle.net/JdDym/
[12:40:42] <eddiemonge> Dorf: you need display: none, not visibility: hidden
[12:41:45] <Dorf> still isn't working
[12:42:30] <afrance> check out the console, you have errors...
[12:43:24] <eddiemonge> Dorf: works fine for me. i also added some changes: http://jsfiddle.net/JdDym/4/
[12:44:20] <eddiemonge> ive seen this before but ive forgotten, how do i disable "caching" on jqui autocomplete where if you type some characters, close the ac popup, then quickly retype the characters, the word choice doesnt come back?
[12:44:42] <Dorf> the error i got was Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[12:45:04] <eddiemonge> Dorf: thats because you have to select jquery as the library in jsfiddle
[12:45:24] <chinoto> I thought something was wrong with our project, but it turned out the spinner examples on (http://jqueryui.com/spinner/) are including (http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/external/jquery.mousewheel.js), is this plugin stable?
[12:46:08] <Dorf> that was on chrome on the actual page
[12:46:59] <clov3r> Dorf: check your jquery include. are you using jQuery.noconflict, etc
[12:47:00] <eddiemonge> Dorf: then you didnt include jquery in the actual page
[12:47:11] <eddiemonge> chinoto: yes its stable. how are you referencing that?
[12:47:52] <chinoto> I haven't included it yet, I just found out that is why scrolling wasn't being captured
[12:48:18] <Dorf> ok yeah.  i missed a /
[12:48:21] <chinoto> well, actually I JUST added it to the auto include folder
[12:50:33] <Dorf> eddiemonge: can you explain the changes you made?  i like the way it works better, but I don't completely understand what you did.
[12:52:15] <eddiemonge> if you hide all the siblings, you also hide the select dropdown that changes them. so i instead targeted the ones that were actually hidden with .hidden. $(this).val() is slower and more characters than this.value.
[12:52:36] <eddiemonge> i also changed the selector drop down so you couldnt select the empty value
[12:53:42] <Dorf> thank you
[13:01:49] <eddiemonge> if you hide all the siblings, you also hide the select dropdown that changes them. so i instead targeted the ones that were actually hidden with .hidden. $(this).val() is slower and more characters than this.value.

[13:02:14] <relipse>  http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/YaKet/ <-- please help me get those divs right aligned that are 100% of the dialog height
[13:06:08] <tab1293> im trying to continually make an ajax request until the response from what I am calling isn't empty. I tried to implement this using a while loop but I want to set a timeout on this loop so the ajax function is only being called every 3 seconds. I don't know how to keep track of the return value from the setTimeout function though
[13:06:12] <tab1293> how can i do this?
[13:07:50] <sacho> tab1293, use a flag.
[13:08:02] <eddiemonge> relipse: here is a start: http://jsfiddle.net/YaKet/2/
[13:08:16] <tab1293> sacho: what do you mean a flag
[13:08:51] <sacho> You don't even need a flag, actually.
[13:09:51] <sacho> var timerID = setInterval(function () { $ajax(); if (data) clearInterval(timerID); }, 3000)
[13:10:39] <eddiemonge> tab1293: http://jsfiddle.net/emazJ/
[13:10:49] <eddiemonge> avoid setinterval, especially with ajax calls
[13:11:32] <dcherman> sacho: you'd want to use setTimeout for that, not setInterval.  what if your request takes longer than 3 seconds?  then you've just made 2 requests before knowing if the response is valid or not.
[13:12:15] <tab1293> eddiemonge: okay but I am trying to do something like while(response != null) {response = ajaxy();}
[13:12:30] <tab1293> but I don't think that works since the settimeout is non blocking
[13:12:47] <eddiemonge> tab1293: did you look at my example?
[13:13:02] <tab1293> eddiemonge: yes
[13:13:04] <eddiemonge> data !== null
[13:13:12] <sacho> you can use the same idea with setTimeout as well.
[13:14:01] <tab1293> eddiemonge: yes but i want to check to see if the array returned is not empty
[13:14:14] <tab1293> my while loop should look like this..
[13:14:41] <tab1293> while(response.length < 1) {response = ajaxy();}
[13:14:53] <tab1293> where ajaxy is returning an array that can potentially be empty
[13:15:01] <tab1293> i want it to keep calling until its not empty
[13:15:13] <eddiemonge> tab1293: you are checking the ajax RESPONSE right?
[13:15:21] <dcherman> tab1293: you're not going to be using a while loop for this - using setTimeout like in eddiemonge's example is the correct way of doing this.
[13:15:48] <TLG> Hello
[13:16:37] <tab1293> that function isn't returning anything though
[13:17:15] <eddiemonge> tab1293: it is. do you know what the success function is an ajax call?
[13:18:15] <tab1293> yes its called on a successful request
[13:18:43] <eddiemonge> tab1293: and the data passed into that function is whats returned from the server

[13:20:34] <BillCriswell> TLG: This is ajax.
[13:20:35] <TLG> but i'll go take a look at the .getjson
[13:20:39] <tab1293> as of now that function is not working
[13:20:39] <BillCriswell> Just wrapped up a bit.
[13:21:04] <BillCriswell> $.getJSON is probably doing just about the code you've provided

[13:29:45] <eddiemonge> ctienrsg_: have you tried some of the pages for this: https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+scroll+sticky&aq=0&oq=javascript+scroll+to+sticky&aqs=chrome.1.57j0.9476j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[13:32:45] <relipse> eddiemonge: do you know how to get a slide transition between the divs?
[13:32:49] <relipse> instead of just hide/show
[13:33:01] <ctienrsg_> eddiemonge: googled a lot in the past weeks
[13:33:14] <eddiemonge> ctienrsg_: have you seen the waypoints plugin?
[13:33:20] <ctienrsg_> so u think what I want is called a 'sticky scroll'?
[13:33:25] <ctienrsg_> eddiemonge: nope
[13:33:41] <eddiemonge> relipse: for what? i forgot what it was
[13:33:51] <eddiemonge> ctienrsg_: its not? it sounds like it
[13:33:55] <ctienrsg_> isn't this overpowered for a simple line of code that i need
[13:35:08] <beg> BillCriswell, http://codepen.io/BegMe/pen/aEtLB got any tips on how to get this working?
[13:35:22] <beg> I don't want it to focus if i click on an another input or textarea
[13:35:32] <ctienrsg_> eddiemonge: looks as if it is notâ€¦
[13:35:45] <ctienrsg_> my jsfiddle should explain what i want
[13:37:06] <BillCriswell> beg: I'd do like if $(this).is('textarea') focus on something.
[13:38:35] <BillCriswell> beg: http://jsbin.com/azubay/1/edit would also work.
[13:39:17] <BillCriswell> Also, you probably want to use a focus event, not a click event.
[13:39:30] <BillCriswell> You can still navigate to that field with your keyboard.
[13:40:02] <beg> BillCriswell, what the example shows is not what I want it to do, it's merely to try out the functions
[13:40:15] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[13:40:17] <beg> I want to always focus a field unless another field is pressed
[13:40:36] <beg> so that i can put text into something else, but it should default back to the chat if anythnig else is pressed
[13:40:50] <Onkeltem> Hi. How can I apply wrapper to the elements in the expression: $(this).after(elements).wrap('<div></div>')?
[13:40:57] <Onkeltem> Currrently it wraps this
[13:41:22] <BillCriswell> Onkeltem: $(this).after(elemenets.wrap())
[13:41:35] <Onkeltem> BillCriswell: oh, thanks :)
[13:41:40] <duanemoody> is it possible to write a jQ function/object that captures the next event object in the chain
[13:42:13] <BillCriswell> Onkeltem: Welcome.
[13:42:24] <eddiemonge> duanemoody: for why?
[13:42:26] <ctienrsg_> having looked at waypoints plugin and some others, i still don't seem as if that what i want, eddiemonge :/
[13:42:52] <eddiemonge> ctienrsg_: i get the sticky part but why the "if x from bottom" part?
[13:42:57] <duanemoody> i.e. delgo("#threads","input.jr_br").click() expands to jQ("#threads").on("click","input.jr_br", function())
[13:43:08] <duanemoody> er, $ for jQ
[13:43:14] <ctienrsg_> eddiemonge: it makes sense on my page
[13:43:25] <ctienrsg_> I have a sidebar
[13:43:41] <ctienrsg_> and without this the sidebar is allowed to crash into my footer
[13:43:56] <duanemoody> but in order for that kind of syntax to work it has to eat the next part of the jQuery chain
[13:44:24] <ctienrsg_> especially because of different browser window sizes and for the reason that my sidebar is quite large, I want this effect and think i need it for a good ux eddiemonge
[13:44:44] <duanemoody> essentially create a metaselector
[13:44:45] <eddiemonge> duanemoody: say what? has to eat the next part?
[13:45:11] <eddiemonge> ctienrsg_: it kind of sounds like bad ux. do you have an example of this working from somewhere else?
[13:45:21] <ctienrsg_> eddiemonge: yeah.
[13:45:29] <duanemoody> the current syntax for using .on() to delegate is unwieldy and i'd like to make a clearer looking function, eddiemonge
[13:45:32] <awc737> what would be the best way to create a large array of elements we would like to track ('#header a', '.nav-menu a') etc. And if one is clicked, know which string in the array set it off?
[13:45:39] <NoiseEee> duanemoody: o.O
[13:46:01] <eddiemonge> duanemoody: you dont like $("parent").on('click', 'ofChild', doThis() )?
[13:46:01] <duanemoody> not a fan of converting commands to text strings
[13:46:03] <awc737> in other words, I don't want to check again "if (clickedElement.parents('.nav-menu')){
[13:46:07] <awc737> I'd just like to know
[13:46:15] <duanemoody> correct
[13:46:24] <NoiseEee> "converting commands to text strings"?
[13:46:32] <ctienrsg_> i show you what inspired me: look at the left 'social bar' here. I want thisâ€¦ http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/fc-bayern-muenchen-aufsichtsrat-stuetzt-uli-hoeness-1.1666972 eddiemonge
[13:46:33] <eddiemonge> duanemoody: so you are opposed to natural language reading of coding?
[13:47:13] <eddiemonge> and your example above is not the same. the first doesnt delegate
[13:47:19] <ctienrsg_> eddiemonge: it doesn't crash into 'Diskutieren, but keeps its distance
[13:47:20] <BillCriswell> awc737: Not sure I'm understanding your problem.
[13:47:35] <awc737> BillCriswell, I'll show you
[13:48:01] <duanemoody> $("#threads").on("click","input.jr_br", doThis()) doesn't delegate?
[13:48:03] <eddiemonge> ctienrsg_: yup that is a sticky scroll element
[13:48:31] <eddiemonge> duanemoody: no, that does. $("input.jr_br", "#threads").click(doThis) doesnt
[13:48:46] <duanemoody> it would if it expanded to the former
[13:49:10] <eddiemonge> but thats a completely different syntax
[13:49:17] <ctienrsg_> so much more research will be needed and i have to change my view on the problem. however, thank you, eddiemonge. Hope i get this amazing effect on my side somehowâ€¦
[13:49:30] <eddiemonge> that means $("#threads").find("input.jr_br").click(doThis)
[13:49:59] <eddiemonge> ctienrsg_: dont forget to take into account large monitors and/or small content
[13:50:18] <duanemoody> no, the idea's that the short syntax is interpreted as the longer one which delegates
[13:50:20] <awc737> BillCriswell, it's psuedocode:
[13:50:21] <awc737> http://jsfiddle.net/tc8Ap/
[13:50:26] <awc737> but that gives you the idea I'm trying to accomplish
[13:51:04] <eddiemonge> duanemoody: thats just not a good idea if you were to ask me. re-writing something that is already short to something else thats already used for a different purpose
[13:51:18] <NoiseEee> $("#threads").on("click","input.jr_br", doThis) most certainly delegates
[13:51:40] <ctienrsg_> eddiemonge: can you explain me in a nutshell why this would be problematic at LARGE monitors? i'm a bit confused
[13:53:33] <eddiemonge> NoiseEee: yes, it does. thats what i said. i said $("input.jr_br", "#threads").click(doThis) doesnt.
[13:54:00] <eddiemonge> ctienrsg_: you have to add checks to see if it even needs to do anything since all the content may not need to scroll
[13:56:02] <MvpGraff> http://jsfiddle.net/czYmA/
[13:56:18] <MvpGraff> would that work for a double action submission on a form based on a selection?
[13:57:02] <eddiemonge> double action submission?
[13:57:18] <MvpGraff> two actions happening based on a selection
[13:57:19] <MvpGraff> :X
[13:58:11] <eddiemonge> MvpGraff: you mean submitting to two different urls? with the same exact data?
[13:58:19] <MvpGraff> yea
[13:58:54] <eddiemonge> MvpGraff: same domain?
[13:59:02] <MvpGraff> nope
[13:59:12] <darkfrog> Hey guys, I've got a problem in IE8 - I'm trying to call $(evt.currentTarget).attr('id'); but it returns Undefined.  That works fine in IE10 and all normal browsers...what do I have to do to make that work in IE8?
[14:00:07] <eddiemonge> MvpGraff: you are trying to do a normal form submit and not ajax?
[14:00:21] <kzurawel> darkfrog: IE8 doesn't support currentTarget. Need to use event.srcElement there.
[14:00:42] <eddiemonge> darkfrog: do console.log( $evt.currentTarget ) and see what you get? does it have to be currentTarget and not just evt.target?
[14:00:43] <darkfrog> kzurawel: well, I fail-over to evt.target
[14:00:54] <MvpGraff> yea, just a normal form submit, only thing is, if the user selects a certain "option" it triggers the second action.
[14:01:08] <darkfrog> kzurawel: neither currentTarget or target are giving me an id
[14:01:42] <eddiemonge> MvpGraff: you'll probably need to clone the form and give it a different action. although i dont know how you will submit both forms at the same. html doesnt really give you that optins
[14:02:12] <MvpGraff> yea I know, that's why I am looking to see if that code I gave would work
[14:02:56] <eddiemonge> MvpGraff: no. you need to submit it using ajax to get what you want
[14:03:08] <MvpGraff> ;[
[14:03:22] <quietschie> hi...is there sth short for $(element).next().next().next() like $(element).next(3) ??
[14:03:49] <duanemoody> http://jsfiddle.net/twnvZ/
[14:03:54] <duanemoody> this is my microfesto
[14:04:54] <wer0ckz> Hi. Is there a converter to make all my jquery codes in one line?
[14:04:59] <MvpGraff> i might as well try it and see if it works, if it doesn't oh well, to Ajax it is  . _ .
[14:05:33] <hugo_moss> i have a problem with the modal in twitter-bootstrap. on the bootstrap site, it opens with a slide in transition, but in my version, upon immediate close, it closes like a normal dialog without the slide up transition.  i did some debugging, in my version, on $this.element.trigger(e), the modal closes immediately.  On bootstraps working version, it passes $this.element.trigger(e), which does
[14:05:33] <hugo_moss> nothing, and then the slide up transition works after reaching hideWithTransition().
[14:05:50] <awc737> what is a better way of doing this?
[14:05:50] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/qEA
[14:05:51] <awc737> it doens't work
[14:05:58] <eddiemonge> quietschie: almost like a nextAll?
[14:06:10] <eddiemonge> wer0ckz: you mean a minifier?
[14:06:11] <hugo_moss> anybody have any idea whats going on
[14:07:15] <eddiemonge> awc737: give the things you want a class and bind the handler on the class
[14:07:20] <wer0ckz> <eddiemonge> wer0ckz: you mean a minifier? <- im not sure. i got 2,000 lines of code
[14:07:30] <wer0ckz> is there a way to make it just one very long line?
[14:07:33] <eddiemonge> wer0ckz: google js minifier
[14:07:42] <awc737> eddiemonge, they pretty much do have a class, at least I can appropriately select them
[14:07:46] <awc737> .nav_level1link
[14:07:47] <wer0ckz> checking
[14:07:55] <awc737> the part I'm asking about is the object/array itterating
[14:09:14] <eddiemonge> awc737: youve read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in right?
[14:09:57] <thujone> awc737: you're iterating over the outer array, but you're not iterating on the inner array
[14:10:24] <awc737> thujone, thanks, I'll make the inner array a string
[14:10:28] <awc737> this.trackedLinks['lvlOneNav'] = '#header_inner a, .nav_level1link';
[14:10:44] <thujone> $(this.trackedLinks[trackedLinkType[0]]).click(function(){
[14:10:57] <thujone> oh yeah, you can do that too
[14:11:05] <quietschie> eddiemonge: yes, i tried that, but $(element).nextAll()[3] doesn't return a object...do i need another $() around it?
[14:11:31] <thujone> it's not a great way to do it
[14:11:50] <beg> I am amazed when I make something but I do not understand how it works at all..
[14:12:00] <thujone> string of multiple classes is better, i guess
[14:13:18] <eddiemonge> quietschie: that would return the dom element. you could use nextAll() and eq. or find a better way to traverse to what you need
[14:13:48] <eddiemonge> beg: maybe should learn it so you can understand it and be able to better troubleshoot/use it in the future
[14:14:11] <eddiemonge> althouh i use a microwave and i dont understand how it works
[14:17:06] <wer0ckz> <eddiemonge> wer0ckz: google js minifier <- is this the one? http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
[14:18:16] <eddiemonge> wer0ckz: its one of them. there are a lot of minifier

[14:29:32] <FrameFever> I want to listen to a position changed of a div
[14:29:39] <FrameFever> how can I do this?
[14:29:56] <FrameFever> everytime the div is moved, a callbacl should be called
[14:31:13] <JohnnyCache> how the div is moved? the user moves it?
[14:31:32] <JohnnyCache> i mean, what moves it
[14:31:40] <FrameFever> JohnnyCache: yes the user moves it, or it is also animated
[14:32:26] <JohnnyCache> if the user moves it, i guess that's with the mouse, so you can use "onmouseup" event and compare coordinates :-)
[14:33:00] <FrameFever> other solution?
[14:33:30] <JohnnyCache> hm.. im not a jquery expert, maybe someone else here have a better solution
[14:33:38] <Z3R0> what is the question / problem ?
[14:33:47] <FrameFever> listen to css changes
[14:33:51] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[14:33:57] <FrameFever> e.g. "left"
[14:35:04] <Pasq89> can i set a timeout to imagesLoaded plugin?
[14:35:34] <Z3R0> yea, I would say the best bet is to honestly create a function and send old object, new object and compare values
[14:35:49] <Z3R0> there isn't a method known
[14:36:18] <JohnnyCache> well
[14:36:35] <JohnnyCache> interval that checks every 50ms the div's top&left ?
[14:36:54] <JohnnyCache> or every second or whatever
[14:36:57] <Z3R0> that's crazy...
[14:37:14] <FrameFever> is this the right one?
[14:37:15] <FrameFever> http://api.jquery.com/change/
[14:37:18] <Z3R0> no
[14:37:47] <Z3R0> there isn't a method known to trigger css attribute changes
[14:38:05] <FrameFever> really?
[14:38:15] <JohnnyCache> you need to "trigger" it yourself i guess
[14:38:19] <Z3R0> I've googled... and I'm a google whore
[14:38:26] <relipse> eddiemonge: i hate to bother you but i'm trying to get your jsfiddle example working on my website and i can't -- http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/ login with: test_test_test admin testtest
[14:38:27] <JohnnyCache> lol
[14:38:30] <Z3R0> trigger is pointless, if you just create a function
[14:38:38] <duanemoody> css changes don't exist within the DOM
[14:38:52] <duanemoody> which means even morph won't catch them
[14:38:57] <duanemoody> they're like variables
[14:39:10] <duanemoody> well this is funny
[14:39:21] <Z3R0> basically you just need to store attributeStart to attributeEnd
[14:39:26] <Z3R0> and a function to check equality
[14:46:51] <eddiemonge> relipse: you didnt add the positioning stuff
[14:49:10] <relipse> haha oops
[14:49:12] <relipse> haha oops
[14:51:04] <Pasq89> hey guys.. i repeat my Q: can i set a timeout to imagesLoaded plugin?
[14:51:25] <Pasq89> i use the one that its embedded on isotope
[14:54:29] <relipse> eddiemonge: can you refresh the page now, the right one shows but not the left one on the next page
[14:54:32] <relipse> click "new bug"
[14:56:42] <eddiemonge> relipse: you need to change page 2 so it shows
[14:58:24] <relipse> it should be showing: https://pastee.org/8u2n3
[14:58:33] <JohnnyCache> Pasq89: you want to load it after x seconds?
[14:59:19] <relipse> oops sorry missing a #
[14:59:41] <Pasq89> JohnnyCache: i wanted to give a change of lets say 2 secs to load all the images...
[14:59:54] <Pasq89> i did a workaround... it does the trick...
[14:59:59] <relipse> eddiemonge: sweet much better, try refreshing :)
[15:00:07] <Pasq89> with setTimeout and a flag! ;)
[15:01:18] <JohnnyCache> Pasq89: :)
[15:01:31] <awc737> how can I user jQuery.ready without it interfering with my existing "this" scope var
[15:01:49] <PREFIX|> save "this" scope war?
[15:02:09] <rupee>  
[15:02:37] <eddiemonge> awc737: say what?
[15:02:40] <awc737> PREFIX|, var
[15:02:56] <awc737> init: function() {, within here "this" is a var referencing my scope
[15:03:12] <awc737> if I put a jquery ready function in there, this becomes whatever jquery assigns to this in a ready function
[15:03:26] <PREFIX|> var self = this
[15:03:45] <awc737> can I also force jquery to use another name?
[15:03:49] <awc737> like as an argument
[15:03:59] <PREFIX|> I have no idea, I'm too much of a newbie to know
[15:04:23] <PREFIX|> but the normal way to preserve this is to save it to a variable afaik
[15:04:50] <eddiemonge> awc737: your ready() shouldnt go in the init. your init should go in the ready()
[15:05:00] <eddiemonge> awc737: noConflict()
[15:05:12] <JosephSilber> eddiemonge, why is that?
[15:05:25] <JosephSilber> If there's code that can run before doc.ready, why wait?
[15:05:44] <PREFIX|> it obviously shouldn't if it depends on the ready
[15:06:12] <awc737> eddiemonge, hmm, I can't really modify that part of the framework (putting their init inside a function(
[15:06:13] <eddiemonge> JosephSilber: if you have an init method its usually for a plugin or block of code that executes all at once
[15:06:47] <JosephSilber> eddiemonge, not necessarily
[15:06:59] <recon_lap> JosephSilber: faster page loading might be a good reason to wait.
[15:08:02] <JosephSilber> recon_lap, imagine there's some data you have to get viw AJAX, which you then put in some element on the page
[15:08:38] <JosephSilber> init: function (){ $.get('/foo', function (data){ $(function(){ $('#foo').html(data) } }) }
[15:10:06] <recon_lap> JosephSilber: but ajax is asynchronous so does not really count does it?
[15:10:30] <JosephSilber> recon_lap, doesn't count as what?
[15:11:24] <recon_lap> JosephSilber: something that would slow a page lading
[15:11:28] <recon_lap> loading*
[15:12:46] <relipse> hey eddiemonge: can you refresh the page again, the transitions are kind of ugly, do you know why?
[15:13:00] <recon_lap> anyway, don't know enough to discuss this intelligently, just suggesting a reason you might wait before running a script
[15:13:09] <JosephSilber> recon_lap, not sure what you mean by that. I was saying that you might want to kick off the AJAX request before the page has finished loading, but then only put it in the DOM on doc.ready
[15:14:20] <eddiemonge> relipse: not really. probably something in the css
[15:21:42] <relipse> in the jquery slide transition is there a callback after the function complete
[15:21:46] <relipse> after the transition is over

[15:53:54] <RNT> is not any way to stop it if the mouse leave the area
[15:53:56] <RNT> ?
[16:00:08] <awc737> http://jsfiddle.net/5FHrE/
[16:00:13] <awc737> why does i always = 2?
[16:00:22] <awc737> and not what it equaled at the time of the loop / bind
[16:01:39] <gf3> chee: Ahahaha â†’ http://cloud.gf3.ca/OnHH
[16:02:32] <myhrlin> awc737: remove i++ on line 9 and instead use i++ inside your alert
[16:03:46] <Gazpacho> awc: because the handler refers to the variable i, whatever value it has
[16:04:23] <awc737> what myhrlin gave me an unexpected, backwards result
[16:04:43] <myhrlin> backwards?
[16:04:52] <awc737> yeah, Level 1 alerted 0
[16:04:54] <awc737> and Level 2 alerted 1
[16:05:23] <awc737> although, maybe the iteration was a bad example, this is what I'm actually trying to accomplish
[16:05:24] <awc737> http://jsfiddle.net/5FHrE/
[16:05:31] <awc737> alerter lvlOneNav if the first element is clicked
[16:06:38] <myhrlin> I don't see how that's backwards, did you read what Gazpacho said?
[16:07:01] <awc737> how do I get the handled to refer to a specific value at the time I set it
[16:07:19] <awc737> and myhrlin it's backward, if it went 1 for level 2 then 0 for level 1
[16:08:22] <awc737> see the second example to see the problem I'm actually trying to solve http://jsfiddle.net/5FHrE/1/
[16:08:25] <myhrlin> on the first iteration i equals zero, this is 'stored' in the alert on the click event for trackedLinks['lvlOneNav']
[16:08:41] <awc737> myhrlin, but it's backwards of what you just said
[16:08:49] <myhrlin> on the second iteration i equasl 1, this is also stored but for trackedLinks['lvlTwoNav']
[16:08:58] <Gazpacho> awc737: You have to create a separate copy of i for each iteration of the loop  http://jsfiddle.net/9NzHM/3/
[16:09:20] <Gazpacho> i is just one variable with one value at a time
[16:09:51] <awc737> yeah, but... seems there should be a way to... extract that value
[16:09:58] <awc737> like convert it to a string
[16:10:03] <awc737> that doesn't make sense I know
[16:10:08] <myhrlin> awc737: the reason i equals 2 on your example is because the loop ends with i++ so it increments 3 times
[16:10:08] <Gazpacho> there is. that's what your original code did
[16:10:14] <Gazpacho> it extracted the value that i had
[16:10:27] <awc737> but mygan it doesn't equal 2
[16:10:33] <awc737> it alerts 1, then 0
[16:10:36] <awc737> it should be 0, then 1
[16:10:55] <awc737> hmm, nvm, seems your right
[16:11:24] <awc737> so is there anyway to apply something simple like that to this? http://jsfiddle.net/5FHrE/3/
[16:11:35] <awc737> or do I need to create an array of trackedLinkType's and create a new value for each one
[16:12:01] <Gazpacho> awc: I posted a link showing what you can do
[16:12:06] <awc737> yeah I'm doing that
[16:13:28] <Gazpacho> yes, you can do the same sort of thing
[16:17:03] <awc737> hmm, Gazpacho that's giving me undefined: http://jsfiddle.net/5FHrE/4/
[16:19:25] <awc737> lol I put i++ in the click function
[16:19:29] <awc737> now it's doing the exact same thing as before
[16:20:41] <awc737> so confused: http://jsfiddle.net/5FHrE/5/'
[16:20:46] <awc737> http://jsfiddle.net/5FHrE/5/ without the '
[16:24:48] <awc737> why is this undefined? http://jsfiddle.net/5FHrE/6/
[16:26:10] <awc737> lol that doesn't work
[16:26:19] <awc737> because it alerts what i is at the time also
[16:26:20] <awc737> argghh
[16:28:54] <awc737> Gazpacho, I don't think it's possible without knowing how many times it will loop, and explicitly creating a new element for each
[16:29:07] <awc737> aside from that, it just doesn't make sense how to make that work
[16:29:12] <Gazpacho> what's not possible?
[16:29:44] <awc737> Gazpacho, anything like this: http://jsfiddle.net/5FHrE/6/
[16:29:50] <awc737> because i will always equal it's LAST value
[16:29:52] <awc737> 2 in this case
[16:30:20] <awc737> so it's still always referecing the last element
[16:34:37] <awc737> IMMPOSSIBRU!!!!
[16:34:50] <awc737> there's a way. where there's a J, there's a way
[16:35:01] <Gazpacho> awc, do exactly what I showed you before  http://jsfiddle.net/qe3Vq/1/
[16:35:01] <awc737> that's what JqUery tought me
[16:35:13] <awc737> Gazpacho, var i2 = i;
[16:36:09] <RNT> i have a <div><img src="aaa"><div>, how i can get the src attribute when i click on that div?
[16:36:31] <RNT> <div id="a">...
[16:36:35] <Gazpacho> $(this).find('img').attr('src')
[16:36:42] <RNT> thx
[16:36:55] <Gazpacho> bah
[16:37:02] <joker_87> ho
[16:37:04] <joker_87> hi
[16:37:11] <Gazpacho> who you callin a ho
[16:37:12] <joker_87> how can i handle multiple buttons in 1 handler?
[16:37:54] <Gazpacho> joker, can you put something on jsfiddle to illustrate
[16:37:56] <joker_87> if i have 100 dinamicallly buttons with differnt id
[16:38:06] <RNT> and to replace the same image?
[16:38:23] <Gazpacho> joker87: the "this" variable in the handler tells you which button is being handled
[16:38:31] <Gazpacho> rnt: read the docs
[16:38:32] <joker_87> any example?
[16:38:36] <RNT> ok
[16:39:09] <joker_87> Gazpacho how?
[16:39:14] <Gazpacho> joker: how what
[16:39:30] <joker_87> i do someone like this: $("#btn_1").click(function()
[16:39:44] <joker_87> but i want to handle all buttons not only the btn_!
[16:39:50] <joker_87> btn_1*
[16:40:13] <awc737> Gazpacho, your example makes no sense, as far as accomplishing what I'm trying to accomplish
[16:40:22] <awc737> can you imagine there is an i3, i4, etc
[16:40:24] <awc737> what would you do?
[16:41:02] <joker_87> any idea?
[16:41:03] <Gazpacho> awc: that will scale to as many elements as you like. You don't need an i3 or i4. every call of a function creates new local variables for that call
[16:41:17] <Gazpacho> that's what makes them local
[16:41:40] <joker_87> Gazpacho waht do you mean with th e "this" variable?
[16:42:16] <Gazpacho> joker87: the one in javascript
[16:42:42] <joker_87> but in the click(function() i only can specify each id of each button
[16:42:57] <joker_87> and i want to have a generalilty handler
[16:43:13] <awc737> Gazpacho, oh.. sorry, I guess I was trying it without the (function() { bit
[16:43:17] <awc737> I didn't understand what that does?
[16:43:45] <Gazpacho> it calls a function. See above
[16:44:11] <Gazpacho> joker: add the line  console.log($(this).attr('id')); to your handler and see what happens when you click
[16:46:11] <Gazpacho> gotta go pick up my pants
[16:47:31] <awc737> thanks a lot Gazpacho [
[16:49:21] <joker_87> says undefined Gazpacho
[16:50:23] <joker_87> <button onclick="javascript:action()"
[16:50:40] <joker_87> function action() {alert($(this).attr('id'));
[16:53:19] <joker_87> any idea?
[16:54:11] <coldhead> i haven't read the full background but i do have the idea that you shouldn't use onclick
[16:54:17] <coldhead> because that shit is from the 1980s
[16:54:24] <coldhead> and we've moved on to better things now
[16:54:28] <coldhead> like game of thrones
[16:54:34] <coldhead> and the new BBC sherlock
[16:55:03] <joker_87> so how can i call it?
[16:55:09] <coldhead> ?click
[16:55:14] <coldhead> `click
[16:55:20] <coldhead> dear god bot fail
[16:55:28] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[16:55:32] <joker_87> but there are diferent buttons not only one
[16:55:32] <coldhead> that sort of a dealy
[16:55:38] <coldhead> so use IDs
[16:55:50] <coldhead> $('#someID').click(action);
[16:56:04] <joker_87> but i have almost 100 difernt id's
[16:56:25] <joker_87> i need to define 100 $('#someId....
[16:57:01] <coldhead> do they all have the same action?
[16:57:06] <joker_87> yes
[16:57:12] <joker_87> only change the id and the value
[16:57:16] <coldhead> $('.some_class').click(action)
[16:57:21] <coldhead> don't use ideas then
[16:57:22] <coldhead> sorry
[16:57:25] <coldhead> that was a bum steer
[16:57:30] <coldhead> ids* lol
[16:57:48] <joker_87> and what's that class?
[16:58:37] <coldhead> i can't know, i haven't read the html
[16:58:38] <PREFIX|> $('.class').on('click',.....
[16:58:47] <coldhead> if you don't have any other buttons you don't even need to use a class
[16:58:54] <coldhead> $('button').click(..)
[16:59:02] <joker_87> ok
[17:00:00] <joker_87> perfect
[17:01:54] <nesoi> hey so I'm trying to access some data as documented here: http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos2/buttonapi.html but it's not working. Here's a simple fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/eKJa4/ could anyone give me a hint?
[17:10:10] <chovy> i have some JSON escaped html...does $('#foo").html(json.html); automatically unescape it?
[17:11:10] <coldhead> god no
[17:11:15] <coldhead> you gotta do that yourself
[17:11:34] <chovy> coldhead: how do i do it?
[17:11:40] <coldhead> $('#foo').html( JSON.parse(json.html) );
[17:12:04] <chovy> coldhead: that doesn't work
[17:12:17] <coldhead> NO U DON'T WORK PAL
[17:12:19] <coldhead> U DON'T WORK
[17:12:31] <chovy> coldhead: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[17:12:56] <coldhead> i don't think you really have JSON
[17:13:02] <chovy> it is choking on the first <a>
[17:13:05] <coldhead> hmm
[17:13:05] <Gazpacho> yeah I don't either
[17:13:11] <coldhead> let me try something magic
[17:13:24] <chovy> it is a json object with an html property
[17:13:29] <coldhead> $('#foo').html( JSON.parse(json).html );
[17:13:29] <chovy> the html is escaped
[17:13:36] <nesoi> heh
[17:14:46] <nesoi> so would anyone be able to look at my fiddle and give me a hint?
[17:14:52] <coldhead> when i can debug something like that without actually even seeing the json, i suddenly remember that i am completely alone and will be, always
[17:15:08] <chovy> coldhead: i can show you the htjml
[17:15:20] <coldhead> i don't want to see the HTML
[17:15:24] <coldhead> i want a nice lie down
[17:15:32] <coldhead> and a gun
[17:15:37] <lenswipee> howdy folks!
[17:15:55] <nesoi> just go out and meet some peeps coldhead
[17:15:55] <coldhead> oh god
[17:16:11] <nesoi> if you're serious about the alone thing
[17:16:16] <coldhead> naw i'm not
[17:16:19] <nesoi> good
[17:16:26] <nesoi> so how about looking at my fiddle
[17:16:26] <coldhead> to be honest i am sick of people and hope never to see one again
[17:16:35] <coldhead> eh your fiddle sounded kind of boring
[17:16:47] <coldhead> but if it will stop you going on about it
[17:16:49] <coldhead> i'll try
[17:16:54] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[17:16:55] <nesoi> :)
[17:16:59] <lenswipee> >js print("hello world");
[17:17:01] <nesoi> oh then
[17:17:15] <lenswipee> js> print("hello world");
[17:17:18] <b-ot> lenswipee: hello world
[17:18:20] <chovy> coldhead: https://gist.github.com/chovy/7adba51324c07b43d1dd
[17:18:27] <coldhead> nesoi: i don't see what's not working
[17:18:34] <nesoi> the console.log
[17:18:40] <lenswipee> js> var $arr = {"one"=>"coldhead", "two" => "nesoi" }; print[$arr.one];
[17:18:43] <b-ot> lenswipee: No output.
[17:18:44] <nesoi> self.thisInput is undefined
[17:19:11] <lenswipee> js> var $arr = {"one"=>"coldhead", "two" => "nesoi" }; print( $arr["one"] );
[17:19:13] <b-ot> lenswipee: No output.
[17:19:34] <nesoi> anyone else care to take a look? I'm trying to access some data as documented here: http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos2/buttonapi.html but it's not working. Here's a simple fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/eKJa4/ could anyone give me a hint?
[17:19:38] <chovy> coldhead: i think jquery is doing the right thing with .html(json.data)
[17:20:23] <coldhead> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/Vv3Ka/
[17:20:33] <coldhead> except like you have JS inside html inside JSON
[17:20:35] <coldhead> it's awful
[17:20:51] <nesoi> supposedly this.thisInput should contain a value. Or I'm doing it wrong
[17:21:45] <coldhead> where can i see docs on thisInput?
[17:21:57] <coldhead> oh right
[17:21:58] <coldhead> nm
[17:22:21] <nesoi> http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos2/buttonapi.html
[17:22:39] <chovy> coldhead: this does the exact same thing
[17:22:39] <chovy> http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/Vv3Ka/1/
[17:23:45] <coldhead> nesoi: http://jsfiddle.net/eKJa4/
[17:24:03] <coldhead> oops http://jsfiddle.net/eKJa4/1/ even
[17:24:08] <coldhead> you can see that property isn't there
[17:24:26] <lenswipee> chovy: that doesn't look safe man
[17:25:13] <nesoi> coldhead:  so the documentation is just wrong?
[17:25:51] <coldhead> no
[17:25:57] <coldhead> the documentation is inadequate
[17:25:58] <coldhead> it says
[17:26:09] <coldhead> "A variable that contains the value of the buttonInput field."
[17:26:18] <coldhead> and i don't see anything about the buttonInput field
[17:26:23] <nesoi> which should be "ok"
[17:26:25] <coldhead> but whatever it is, i bet it's important
[17:26:26] <nesoi> the text
[17:26:29] <coldhead> you think?
[17:26:35] <nesoi> I think so
[17:26:36] <coldhead> that sounds like the text, not the value
[17:26:44] <coldhead> but neither of us can say for sure
[17:26:46] <coldhead> we're just hoping
[17:26:52] <coldhead> i'd be looking at the sourcecode
[17:27:01] <coldhead> and searching for thisInput and buttonInput
[17:27:06] <coldhead> to see what the fuck is up
[17:27:30] <coldhead> chovy: your code and mine is different
[17:27:43] <coldhead> because your code has pure JS in a variable called "json"
[17:27:51] <coldhead> and mine has actual JSON in a variable called json
[17:28:17] <nesoi> thisInput shows up exactly once in that code - http://dev.jtsage.com/cdn/simpledialog/latest/jquery.mobile.simpledialog2.js
[17:28:38] <coldhead> chovy: works better if you escape the </script> A variable that contains the value of the buttonInput field.
[17:28:39] <coldhead> er
[17:28:39] <nesoi> unfortunately I don't know jquery enough to understand what it's doing
[17:28:44] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/Vv3Ka/2/
[17:29:46] <chovy> coldhead: it's passed to me as a json object already
[17:30:08] <chovy> its not given to me as a string
[17:30:14] <coldhead> then it is not JSON
[17:30:17] <coldhead> it is just a JS object
[17:30:29] <coldhead> nesoi: sorted http://jsfiddle.net/eKJa4/2/
[17:30:37] <coldhead> you need buttonInput: true
[17:30:42] <coldhead> and it gives you the value of that input
[17:30:42] <chovy> i thought application/json will make it a json object
[17:30:45] <coldhead> if you type something in it
[17:31:14] <chovy> you're saying there's a difference between a javascript object and json?
[17:31:18] <coldhead> yes
[17:31:27] <coldhead> JSON is a string representation of a javascript object
[17:31:33] <coldhead> an object is just an object
[17:31:42] <coldhead> it's subtle
[17:31:46] <coldhead> maybe it doesn't matter to you now
[17:31:51] <coldhead> but by god some day it will do
[17:31:58] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[17:32:03] <chovy> heh
[17:32:14] <nesoi> ah. coldhead what I'm looking for is some value I can pass when I define the function and then use when the function executes so I can know what button was actually pushed
[17:32:46] <coldhead> right, i have no idea how that's done
[17:32:54] <coldhead> i basically hate this library so far
[17:32:56] <nesoi> arguments maybe?
[17:33:09] <coldhead> i'd rather nail my scrotum to a coffee table
[17:33:27] <h3nryturk> Has anyone ever run into memory issues when the view is being rendered?
[17:34:19] <adamsilver> i am unable to have multiple $(document).ready(function(){ â€¦ i've read it's possible but when I have $(document).ready(function(){ on the external linked js file the one in my file head stops working until i disable the other. Why is that?
[17:34:33] <coldhead> nesoi: i'd try searching github for some text from that plugin
[17:34:40] <coldhead> to see if you can find some example uses
[17:34:48] <coldhead> where you can maybe see wtf is going on
[17:35:02] <nesoi> I can't find any though
[17:35:05] <nesoi> looked
[17:35:07] <coldhead> and if you can't find any, that's a warning
[17:35:17] <coldhead> :\
[17:35:52] <nesoi> under arguments on that doc page.. how do you think I'd pass and retrieve an arg?
[17:37:15] <coldhead> it's really impossible to tell from these docs
[17:37:17] <coldhead> arguments[1]+
[17:37:24] <coldhead> that is almost meaningless
[17:37:31] <nesoi> the args property
[17:37:48] <coldhead> i think it's saying you need to sacrifice a dove
[17:37:52] <coldhead> but i can't be sure
[17:38:57] <quietschie> hey, if i clone(true) an element, then all the eventhandlers are also cloned? Is that right?
[17:39:21] <coldhead> sure, why not
[17:40:30] <quietschie> it seems, that they are not
[17:41:00] <wilkinsmc> hey guys
[17:41:05] <Blooperly> Jquery IRC?? Awesome!
[17:41:13] <wilkinsmc> i'm trying to figure out where in the world is Carmen San Diego
[17:44:04] <coldhead> wherever you go, there you are
[17:45:00] <wilkinsmc> : D
[17:45:06] <wilkinsmc> i seem to remember hating that show as a kid
[17:45:30] <Blooperly> Do you guts suggest using jquery 1.9 or 2.0???
[17:45:32] <coldhead> people can change, man
[17:45:47] <coldhead> depends on your needs, Blooperly
[17:45:57] <coldhead> do you need to support older browsers, mostly
[17:46:19] <nesoi> coldhead:  do you know how I can see everything in that self object to see if what I need might be in there?
[17:46:28] <coldhead> nesoi: it was in my fiddle
[17:46:31] <coldhead> console.log(self)
[17:46:34] <Blooperly> Not particularly... Do lots of people still use IE 6-8?
[17:46:36] <coldhead> or console.dir(self)
[17:46:42] <coldhead> and then click on the lil triangle
[17:46:49] <coldhead> no one important, Blooperly
[17:46:54] <coldhead> just jerks
[17:46:58] <coldhead> but if you're selling stuff
[17:47:07] <coldhead> those are usually the easies tjerks to get money out of
[17:47:31] <Blooperly> hahaha. Well that is a good point. nah its just for some webApp stuff.
[17:47:34] <Blooperly> Go Chrome!
[17:47:42] <nesoi> console.log(self) shows things like $.(anonymous function).(anonymous function)
[17:47:44] <nesoi> etc.
[17:48:00] <coldhead> yes nesoi
[17:48:04] <coldhead> it also shows the other stuff
[17:48:14] <coldhead> i don't know how to make it show JUST the stuff you are interested in
[17:48:25] <coldhead> but you can see EVERYTHING which INCLUDES the stuff you're interested in
[17:48:31] <coldhead> the lil triangle is the key
[17:48:35] <coldhead> makes it all open up for you
[17:48:42] <coldhead> like a nymphomaniac
[17:48:54] <hugo_moss> ok i have a problem
[17:49:02] <hugo_moss> im using prototype and jquery together,
[17:49:17] <coldhead> that in itself is a problem
[17:49:17] <Blooperly> Coldhead: Is there any benefit to putting a copy of jquery on my web server? Or should I just use the public copy? Significant speed differences?
[17:49:21] <hugo_moss> im using twitter-bootstrap also,
[17:49:39] <coldhead> Blooperly: CDN will be faster because it will likely already be cached
[17:50:08] <Blooperly> oh really? Sweet. Thanks
[17:50:28] <nesoi> wow console.dir, that solved itl! thanks coldhead
[17:50:37] <coldhead> happy hacking nesoi
[17:50:53] <coldhead> on an unrelated note, can anyone please kill me
[17:51:41] <hugo_moss> now when i use a bootstrap modal, when i close the modal, it goes to its hide method, now what i found is there is code that says: e = $.Event('hide'); this.$element.trigger(e); when it calls that trigger, it goes to jquery then reaches in jQuery.event.trigger a statement "elem[type]()", this calls prototypes methodize and applies prototypes hide function
[17:51:42] <nesoi> self.options.args was the answer
[17:51:50] <nesoi> cheers
[17:52:00] <coldhead> of course it is the answer, nesoi, because it's not in the docs >: |
[17:52:14] <hugo_moss> e= $.Event('hide') is bootstraps statement call
[17:52:33] <hugo_moss> now what do i do? do i patch bootstrap.js, if so how? or do i patch jquery?
[17:53:17] <coldhead> have you ever thought about another career, hugo_moss?
[17:53:25] <coldhead> landscape gardening for isntance?
[17:53:57] <hugo_moss> are you going to be obtuse? or should i just go to stackoverflow?
[17:54:01] <Blooperly> hahaha
[17:54:16] <coldhead> hugo_moss: i am just despairing because you are doing a difficult thing and it makes me sad
[17:54:19] <coldhead> but also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9252361/twitter-bootstrap-v2-and-jquery-no-conflict
[17:54:25] <coldhead> that apparently can help
[17:54:31] <hugo_moss> coldhead im already using noconflict
[17:54:35] <coldhead> the 1st answer looks legit
[17:54:38] <ThinkCritically> any query mobile gurus in here?
[17:54:41] <coldhead> no it's about noConflict AND load order
[17:54:51] <hugo_moss> ok
[17:55:01] <coldhead> hugo_moss: this one too, for variety http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12136505/how-to-get-twitter-bootstrap-to-work-with-prototype-js
[17:55:14] <coldhead> that's the "patch bootstrap" option
[17:55:16] <coldhead> which urgh
[17:55:22] <hugo_moss> that i have already seen
[17:55:24] <hugo_moss> and done
[17:55:32] <coldhead> the other one seems better
[17:55:41] <coldhead> load jQ, load bootstrap, noConflict and then load prototype
[17:55:55] <hugo_moss> and then load prototype
[17:56:01] <hugo_moss> ok that i dont think ive done
[17:56:06] <hugo_moss> let me try that
[17:56:12] <hugo_moss> thank you for helping coldhead
[17:56:13] <coldhead> good luck babe
[17:57:31] <quietschie> i have a strange issue with my dynatree...after i clone(true) it, the onClick() doesn't work. has anybody any idea?
[17:57:37] <ThinkCritically> trying to call on jam page from another - when I do so $(document).ready does not fire and can't seem to get $(#idofpage).on('pageinit', function to work either - anyone have any suggestions?
[17:58:39] <coldhead> why don't people have normal problems
[17:58:48] <coldhead> these are all vooodoo problems
[17:58:55] <coldhead> something dee oh oh economics
[17:58:57] <coldhead> etc
[17:59:04] <ThinkCritically> cold head - I just want this voodoo to go away :)
[17:59:27] <quietschie> same here :)
[18:00:07] <ThinkCritically> calling one jquery mobile page from another should really be straight forward - you would think
[18:00:44] <ThinkCritically> each of the 'pages' is in its own file - but when I make the call $(document).ready does not fire :( :(
[18:02:00] <quietschie> have you tried jQuery(document) instead of $ ? I heard that in some cases $ doesn't work
[18:02:55] <ThinkCritically> I will give it a try - but I think it is much more basic than that - I am literally just linking two pages together - probably not calling the right event or something :(
[18:03:38] <quietschie> coldhead, do you have any clue for me?
[18:03:52] <quietschie> how could i figure out, whats wrong?
[18:04:43] <coldhead> quietschie: if you're loading new page content via AJAX any <script> tags are stripped out
[18:04:52] <coldhead> that may be the issue
[18:05:53] <quietschie> i'm adding the listeners via js
[18:06:13] <Blooperly> Anyone know a good simple AJAX tutorial? The only thing I really need jquery for right now is so that my webpage doesnt refresh on submit.
[18:07:17] <quietschie> not in a <script> tag
[18:08:51] <coldhead> quietschie: are you using delegation?
[18:08:57] <coldhead> what we used to call live() ?
[18:09:12] <coldhead> except you can't call it that now or you'll be marked as a leper
[18:09:33] <quietschie> sry, i don't understand that
[18:09:46] <quietschie> but i guess, i'm not using delegation
[18:10:15] <coldhead> quietschie: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[18:10:21] <coldhead> look at the examples there
[18:10:30] <coldhead> they might help you understand what you should be doing
[18:10:35] <coldhead> except use on() instead of delegate()
[18:12:39] <quietschie> coldhead: i guess thats exactly what i need!
[18:12:54] <quietschie> thanks!
[18:14:04] <RNT> is there a easy way to move a text in its container if won't fit?
[18:14:07] <coldhead> good luck quietschie
[18:15:07] <Pavlov> hi, i'm trying to use the jquery lazyload plugin to lazy load some images, but i'm using knockout and inserting them in to the dom dynaimcally.... whats the best event to listen to to call lazyload on the images as they're inserted in to the document?
[18:15:31] <oste> anyone know how to get the currently selected values using the select2 plugin?
[18:16:10] <Blooperly> oh my this is confusing. How do I AJAX?? All I want is some text to change when I press a button :(
[18:16:34] <coldhead> does it need to be ajax?
[18:16:40] <Blooperly> uhhh no
[18:16:50] <RNT> me, i want a text twon't fit :(o move if
[18:16:56] <RNT> lol
[18:16:57] <Blooperly> But I thought that was the only way to submit something without the page reloading?
[18:17:15] <RNT> me, i want a text to move if won't fit
[18:17:38] <coldhead> Blooperly: http://jsfiddle.net/3nRTb/
[18:17:52] <coldhead> i don't understand what you mean, RNT
[18:17:57] <coldhead> do you have a jsfiddle test case?
[18:18:04] <coldhead> if you're talking about detecing overflow
[18:18:06] <coldhead> man, that is hard
[18:18:33] <RNT> i had a kind of box, where i have a dinamically text, most of time the thex fits inside the box,
[18:18:45] <RNT> but it happens it won't fit...
[18:19:05] <coldhead> i'd just use text-overflow: ellipsis
[18:19:09] <RNT> and i cannot control the lenght of txt, is imported from another web page
[18:19:18] <coldhead> and give the full text in a title="" tooltip
[18:19:20] <RNT> give me a link pls
[18:19:24] <coldhead> and try to move on with my life

[18:20:13] <coldhead> lol bots <3
[18:21:48] <RNT> coldhead, but that one requires scrollers?
[18:21:50] <PREFIX|> is there a nicer way to do this: domObj.on('mouseenter', function() { myFunc(this); } ); ?
[18:21:56] <RNT> O_O
[18:22:03] <s2013> whats the difference between bind and on?
[18:22:11] <s2013> im a bit confused about that
[18:22:17] <Blooperly> thanks coldhead :)
[18:23:13] <coldhead> s2013: bind() is the old way of saying on()
[18:23:21] <coldhead> you basically just want to use on() now
[18:23:24] <coldhead> and forget about bind()
[18:23:26] <s2013> oh
[18:23:33] <coldhead> ditto live() and click()
[18:23:36] <coldhead> er
[18:23:39] <coldhead> delegate()
[18:23:47] <s2013> because i was reading few tutorials and some used on and some used bind so i was confused
[18:23:53] <coldhead> on() is the hot new way
[18:23:56] <coldhead> and less typing
[18:24:01] <coldhead> they do the same things
[18:24:17] <s2013> oh alright
[18:24:31] <s2013> and for ajax is it $.ajax now? or is it still $.load and .get .post
[18:24:45] <coldhead> RNT: maybe you'd prefer this? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ftimD
[18:24:52] <PREFIX|> man my JS has turned ugly, oh well it works atleast
[18:25:05] <coldhead> s2013: load and get and post are convenience methods
[18:25:09] <coldhead> they all use AJAX interneally
[18:25:16] <s2013> what does $.ajax do?
[18:25:24] <coldhead> it makes an AJAX request to the server
[18:25:28] <coldhead> but it has more options
[18:25:32] <coldhead> if you need fine grained control
[18:25:39] <s2013> oh ok
[18:25:45] <coldhead> if you can get by with the others then you don't need AJAX
[18:25:51] <coldhead> er ajax()
[18:25:58] <coldhead> but it's there if you needd it for somethig fancy
[18:26:08] <Blooperly> Uhhh ok last question. How do I integrate standard javascript and jquery??
[18:26:40] <Blooperly> I want to run a javascript function without refreshing the page, and without rewriting it in jquery
[18:26:49] <s2013> just use it like normal js?
[18:26:53] <coldhead> you can just use JS
[18:26:56] <coldhead> jQ is JUST JS
[18:26:58] <RNT> coldhead, something like this:
[18:26:59] <coldhead> it's just a js lib
[18:27:00] <RNT> http://www.maxvergelli.com/docs/jquery-scroller/examples.html
[18:27:20] <RNT> the second example, Simple scrolling text...
[18:27:22] <coldhead> RNT: why don't you just use that then
[18:27:46] <RNT> i thought may be something easy to use
[18:28:02] <RNT> i don,t need the whole plugin
[18:28:29] <Blooperly> coldhead: So can I just shove some js function stuff into that script you gave me?
[18:28:29] <s2013> whats the modern equivalent of unbind?
[18:28:32] <RNT> and i'm not sure i can use it, that one
[18:30:01] <coldhead> s2013: off

[18:44:12] <Blooperly> ..... Wow. I just figured out I can use "button" instead of "submit", and I dont need any jquery -_-
[18:44:22] <PREFIX|> What is the prettiest/best way to set the CSS of the child of a target of an event? as in domObject.on('mouseenter', myFunc); var myFunc = function(event) { ... }   event.target.children[0] gives the child but that's a normal DOM object and not a jQuery object to use .css on

[18:44:45] <mashlol> of course you can Blooperly!
[18:44:48] <mashlol> =)
[18:47:58] <lenswipee> There is a image I want to get from a site but the site has disabled right-click. Is there a way to get it?
[18:48:31] <PREFIX|> open in chrome, hit ctrl+shift+j
[18:48:39] <PREFIX|> find dom object, copy url
[18:50:01] <lenswipee> I'm using IE. Still possible to do with that trick?
[18:50:06] <wilkinsmc> hit me up, before you go go, because i'm not planning on flying solo
[18:50:30] <coldhead> why are you using IE
[18:50:32] <wilkinsmc> lesn: printscreen button on keyboard
[18:50:34] <wilkinsmc> printscreen
[18:50:44] <coldhead> actually, a better point is "Don't use IE"
[18:53:37] <lenswipee> coldhead: What do you use?
[18:53:44] <wilkinsmc> he's being a morality nazi
[18:53:49] <Blooperly> Chrome all the way :D
[18:54:05] <wilkinsmc> chrome seems to work best with my personal websites for sure
[18:54:13] <wilkinsmc> probably works best with all
[18:54:32] <wilkinsmc> i have to do some extreme tinkering to get IE and firefox to work as well
[18:54:35] <coldhead> chrome has a whole bunch of neat debugging tools baked in
[18:54:39] <coldhead> it's a no brainer
[18:54:56] <coldhead> i actually use chromium because freedom, braveheart etc
[18:55:05] <lenswipee> Problem is Windows is the most widely used OS and ships with IE. So I develop in IE to capture this massive market.
[18:55:36] <coldhead> you can develop faster in another brother
[18:55:46] <coldhead> and just use IE when you need to test IE
[18:56:00] <coldhead> i use chrome to make stuff for ANy Browser*
[18:56:19] <lenswipee> coldhead: What add-on stuff you use with your Chrome?
[18:56:38] <coldhead> nothing much
[18:56:49] <coldhead> dev tools is pretty rich
[18:56:54] <coldhead> i use colorzilla too
[18:56:58] <coldhead> that might be all
[19:00:33] <bowenac> anyone familiar with slideToggle? Having an issue where sometimes the slide will keep sliding up and down up and down...
[19:04:39] <wilkinsmc> well ya
[19:04:45] <wilkinsmc> i figure 95 percent of my customers use IE
[19:05:07] <wilkinsmc> the other five split up between chrome and firefox
[19:05:12] <wilkinsmc> and who cares about the others
[19:05:18] <wilkinsmc> tho mobile i might do eventuallly

[19:44:08] <b1lly> I MISSED YOU
[19:44:56] <b1lly> $('selector').trigger('paste'); ? lol
[19:46:17] <b1lly> that's a lie
[19:46:27] <b1lly> I don't think you can retrieve data from the users clipboard
[19:46:35] <b1lly> for security reasons
[19:47:22] <Pas89> hmm... thats what i found out too... :/ thanx billy
[19:47:34] <b1lly> wait
[19:47:36] <b1lly> I could be lieing again
[19:47:59] <b1lly> there's a way for it to work in IE
[19:48:01] <b1lly> but IE only
[19:48:03] <coldhead> Pas89: i think you can, but you have to use flash
[19:48:19] <b1lly> coldhead:  EWWWWW
[19:48:20] <Pas89> from what i found, some copy paste works.. only in IE...
[19:48:27] <Pas89> i read that too...
[19:48:42] <coldhead> Pas89: https://github.com/jonrohan/ZeroClipboard
[19:48:42] <Pas89> if there are 2 things i dont like in web dev, is IE and flash! :P
[19:48:59] <PREFIX|> how would I check if $('#mydiv3').next() returns mydiv3 (meaning i'm at the last div)
[19:49:11] <coldhead> hmm, that only seems to do copy, not paste
[19:49:16] <coldhead> b1lly is probably right
[19:49:18] <coldhead> AS USUAL
[19:49:23] <Pas89> yes!
[19:49:39] <Pas89> i dont think i will use it!
[19:49:43] <Pas89> thank you guys!
[19:49:54] <coldhead> PREFIX|: if ($('#mydiv3').next().length === 0)
[19:50:23] <b1lly> well

[19:55:35] <b1lly> aaas: your confused because nextActive is defined
[19:55:49] <b1lly> aaas: BUT it's not a jquery object, so it doesn't have a .animate method
[19:56:26] <aaas> b1lly ah... so attr doesnt return an object then?
[19:56:44] <aaas> ah
[19:56:53] <aaas> returns a string

[20:03:45] <coldhead> sometimes i wish for the long way home
[20:05:32] <b1lly> I always take the short bus the long way
[20:08:39] <b1lly> SHIT SHIT SHIT
[20:08:42] <b1lly> I GOT A PROBLEM
[20:08:42] <coldhead> b1lly: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=reopened&type=bug&group=component&report=1&order=priority
[20:14:22] <aaas> im trying to implement a sliding treeview similar to this: http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.8/dojox/mobile/TreeView.html    Is it best to define the click() function for all clickable elements (even the ones not visible, offscreen) at page load or do I wait until the particular clickable divs are visible before defining  the relevant click() functions (as in inside an .animate callback)
[20:20:38] <coldhead> just like heaven
[20:27:00] <tw2113> coldhead, are you secretly Robert Smith?
[20:27:13] <coldhead> god no, i wish
[20:27:18] <coldhead> that cat can really play
[20:28:55] <hugo_moss> well coldhead
[20:29:02] <hugo_moss> thank you for your suggestion
[20:29:13] <hugo_moss> but it did not harvest any fruit
[20:29:45] <hugo_moss> apparently
[20:30:11] <hugo_moss> what happens is, i load that in the correct order, but it makes no difference. why? because..
[20:30:47] <hugo_moss> first jquery is loaded, no_conflict mode is set, bootstrap loaded, then other jquery files, and finally prototype
[20:31:09] <hugo_moss> but the thing is the click event doesn't occur until after prototype is loaded
[20:32:29] <hugo_moss> so after you do the click, the code that is executed is prototypes version
[20:32:35] <hugo_moss> but i still dont exactly get why
[20:32:36] <coldhead> no no no
[20:32:46] <coldhead> jquery, then bootstrap, THEN no conflict
[20:32:49] <coldhead> then prototype
[20:32:56] <hugo_moss> oh
[20:33:02] <coldhead> if you no conflict before bootstrap then bootstrap can't find jQuery
[20:33:02] <hugo_moss> why does that make a difference?
[20:33:10] <hugo_moss> oh shit
[20:33:34] <hugo_moss> thank you dear kind sir
[20:33:45] <hugo_moss> my dear friend
[20:33:54] <coldhead> well, thank me if it works <3
[20:34:09] <hugo_moss> oh
[20:34:11] <hugo_moss> i forgot
[20:34:15] <hugo_moss> see what i also did was
[20:34:16] <boytoy_> hugo_moss: i believe it's "thank you dear kind ma'am"
[20:34:22] <coldhead> :D
[20:34:41] <hugo_moss> i made no_conflict and stored jquery inside another variable $jq191
[20:34:48] <hugo_moss> and then in bootstrap, i did a replace
[20:35:04] <hugo_moss> for the following: $(, $., $)
[20:35:11] <hugo_moss> for $jq191
[20:35:14] <hugo_moss> shouldnt that have worked?
[20:35:25] <coldhead> i don't know
[20:35:27] <hugo_moss> it doesn't use the $ at all
[20:35:34] <coldhead> editing bootstrap gives me the heebies
[20:35:43] <hugo_moss> it uses $jq191
[20:36:03] <coldhead> the important thing is i'm going to lunch now
[20:36:07] <coldhead> so good luck with everything!
[20:36:12] <hugo_moss> ok thank you
[20:36:12] <coldhead> for the rest of your life!
[20:36:25] <hugo_moss> thanks
[21:08:18] <abjorn> coldhead: you a megadeth fan, then?
[21:36:20] <wilkinsmc> the reason my links were going to html is because my nav html was pointing to it, even tho my jquery wasn't :P
[21:36:34] <wilkinsmc> i can't believe i missed that, guess i thought only the jquery would trigger
[21:36:42] <wilkinsmc> to index.html*
[21:48:24] <coldhead> b-ot: tell abjorn not a fan, just interested to hear more of them. expecting disappointment, like the last time i looked up anthrax. but i like trying to expand my ears
[21:48:35] <coldhead> bot-t: tell abjorn not a fan, just interested to hear more of them. expecting disappointment, like the last time i looked up anthrax. but i like trying to expand my ears

[23:09:09] <wilkinsmc> :D :D :D :D :D
[23:09:28] <wilkinsmc> you thought i was happy when i was really just drawing back to back midget penises
[23:09:44] <coldhead> hey whatever keeps you off the streets
[23:12:37] <bogdaniel> good morning everyone who can help me fix the remove function from this code http://jsfiddle.net/nf6tT/ ? i've got no clues why it doesn't work as it should.
[23:18:29] <freannrak> I've got a row with 3 input fields. At least one of them needs to be filled in before submit. Creating such verification for 1 row is really simple. The problem is that user can dynamically add more rows. I created some pseudo-code using regex, but it got pretty complicated. Surely there must be an easier way...
[23:25:57] <xLambruscox> Hi! If I want to use custom function for each element based on jQuery selector, how should I call it?
[23:27:42] <coldhead> freannrak: http://jsfiddle.net/Qbkgz/
[23:28:31] <freannrak> coldhead: thanks, checking it out now...
[23:28:58] <coldhead> this is a little better perhaps http://jsfiddle.net/Qbkgz/1/
[23:29:31] <coldhead> xLambruscox: $('.someselector').each(function () { someFunc(this); }); // generally
[23:30:20] <xLambruscox> coldhead: thanks, I just was writing that I googled and found just it) but great thanks!!
[23:30:35] <coldhead> have fun
[23:36:26] <relipse>  $(this).hide("slide", { direction: "down" }, 1000); <-- is there a way to run a callback function after the transition is completed or do i have to use a timer?
[23:36:51] <freannrak> coldhead: thanks again, it was helpful :=).
[23:37:32] <coldhead> relipse: http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[23:37:39] <coldhead> the docs has a few different ways to do it
[23:37:46] <coldhead> the complete callback is the one you care about
[23:44:43] <hazardous> anyone know a good jquery translation/localisation plugin?
[23:45:01] <hazardous> the text it needs to iterate on is delivered via ajax too, so i'd need some way to 'rerun' it after a success:{}
[23:46:32] <hazardous> the stuff i search for is like 'jqueryTranslator is a jQuery plugin which allows developers to translate a static web site easily. '
[23:46:36] <coldhead> hazardous: i believe this lib is "best practice" http://slexaxton.github.io/Jed/
[23:47:41] <dblosevn> Hey guys, anybody ever play around with http://tablesorter.com/docs/ ? having problems trying to get it to lazy render the pager when the table its rendering is in a tab :-(
[23:48:03] <coldhead> ew
[23:48:17] <hazardous> coldhead: this seems .. hard to grasp
[23:48:29] <hazardous> it loosk really nice but i need to translate a total of 30 words
[23:49:11] <dblosevn> hazardous: sounds like a job for translate.google.com then lol why waste time writing code for 30 words to be translated
[23:49:13] <coldhead> i don't know of the "not quite best practice" alternative
[23:49:26] <coldhead> i'd just learn Jed, use it and put it on my CV
[23:49:30] <coldhead> then ask for a raise
[23:49:40] <coldhead> then i'd probably get drunk
[23:49:48] <dblosevn> id prolly overcomplicate it though and implement i18n though lmao but thats just me lol
[23:49:51] <hazardous> haha
[23:50:01] <hazardous> yeah, i have .json files already
[23:50:04] <hazardous> tried to use jquery-localise or whatever
[23:50:06] <hazardous> but it chokes on 2.0
[23:51:00] <hazardous> is https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.i18n a thing?
[23:51:13] <dblosevn> coldhead: ew @ me?
[23:51:38] <hazardous> coldhead: if only i could buy alcohol yet ;[
[23:51:38] <antoon> Greetings fellow users
[23:52:54] <coldhead> it's a terrible curse, don't do it
[23:58:48] <antoon> Weird question: Is it possible to add a jquery.click-event on a div that's added through ajax?
