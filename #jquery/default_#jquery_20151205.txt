[00:29:25] <alturic> Rantanen Would I be looking to put padding stuff in generatebuttonrange or generatebuttons? I'm trying something simple like var max = 3; while(num.length < max ){ num = "0" + num; } inside generatebuttons. :-/
[00:30:26] <Rantanen> generateButtons. That method is the one that creates them - it's meant for those weird cases and can be used with... generateButtons([ 6, 12, 24, 123, 200, 201 ])
[00:30:49] <Rantanen> The generateButtonRange is just a convenience method for those simple cases :)
[00:31:12] <alturic> Rantanen How difficult is this going to be to make <button id="fhrb" type="button" class="btn btn-default" ' + 'value="hr' + num + '">'+ num (THIS ONE CAN BE THE NON-PADDED VALUE) +'</button>
[00:32:09] <Rantanen> Easy
[00:32:14] <Rantanen> Your while loop above is on the correct track.
[00:32:25] <alturic> My Fail Attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/90gfc7eL/
[00:32:31] <Rantanen> Unfortunatley numbers (such as: 1) don't have "length" attribute. Only strings, such as: '1'
[00:32:39] <alturic> oh.
[00:32:42] <alturic> grr
[00:32:53] <Rantanen> So before you hit the while-loop, you need to convert the number to a string.
[00:33:18] <Rantanen> There's million ways to do that in JavaScript. var numstr = '' + num; works
[00:33:39] <Rantanen> Or String( num )
[00:33:50] <Evidlo> Is there any way to force the DOM to be updated after moving elements?  I'm selecting elements based on what div they are inside and I need the DOM to be accurate
[00:33:54] <Rantanen> And if you keep 'num' and 'numstr' separate, that means you can still use 'num' in the non-padded place
[00:34:41] <alturic> oh my this is....
[00:45:31] <Mark_____> does anyone know how to put title to each slide of this page, and make it appear only when it is selected? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/project#firstPage
[00:45:44] <Mark_____> if anyone can give me a slightest hint, i would very much appreciate it.
[01:08:39] <alturic> Rantanen I didn't thank you for the amount of time you've spent on this. I truly appreciate all of your work. This has been working amazing.
[01:59:54] <alturic> Does anyone know how I can make it so when you click #fhr button it switched to that image, but then if you hover over a #fhr button it switches to that image and then when you leave the hover it goes back to the clicked #fhr? http://jsfiddle.net/dr8uc6kn/
[03:02:25] <alturic> If I'm doing $('#fhr button').click(function() { ... }).mouseover(function() { ... }).mouseleave(function is there anyway to not fire the mouseover and mouseleave unless click was actually performed?

[06:23:47] <estan> hm. this is a newb question: is there some catch-all function i can call to get the "value" of an element? i have a function which should render markdown from a "source" element, first i used .val() since i was always working with textareas as source element.
[06:24:26] <estan> but now i'd like it to work with e.g. p elements as source as well (and then i should use .html() to get the source markdown).
[06:25:36] <estan> is there some function i can call which catch these two cases, or will i have to have e.g. if source.is('input textarea et.c.') { use source.val() } else { use source.html() } ?
[07:55:51] <kdehl> Hello. I have created this ugly interface: http://david.dose.se/maps/infrastructure/admin.html
[07:56:12] <kdehl> You can add points (latitude, longitude and name fields) to a database.
[07:57:13] <kdehl> All the entries are presented as <li> elements in an unordered list. Pretty simple.
[07:57:29] <kdehl> Now I wonder, can I keep more information in a li element than is presented to the user?
[07:57:54] <kdehl> I'd like to keep an 'id' field available as well, but the user ought not to be aware of its existence.
[07:58:33] <kdehl> This is to make it easier to implement a HTTP DELETE call to the database.
[07:59:20] <shoky> <li data-id="1234">
[08:00:10] <shoky> or if you're adding the li's dynamically from your js code,  then you can set the data on them with .data('id', '1234')
[08:00:21] <kdehl> Right. That's what I'm doing.
[08:00:22] <shoky> and read with .data('id')
[08:00:29] <kdehl> Alright. Perfect.
[08:00:55] <kdehl> Is this a good design though? Would you rather keep the actual data elsewhere and just present part of it to the user as li elements?
[08:01:41] <kdehl> (Pardon my incorrect use of terminology, I'm a noob.)
[08:02:01] <shoky> if each id is related to each li uniquely, and you later want to get the id for an li you've got,  this is a good way to do it yeah
[08:02:17] <shoky> this is precisely what .data() is for
[08:02:29] <kdehl> Ah. Cool. Thanks!
[08:02:33] <shoky> np
[08:03:10] <kdehl> estan: Sorry, I have no idea.
[08:03:43] <kdehl> :)

[09:52:09] <pe> Hi, i have 2 angularjs applications protected with a Basic Authentication. One of the 2 applications has to access some files of the other domain. Due to the Basic Authentication and the fact that it is a CORS request, jquery sends "OPTIONS" before "GET". "OPTIONS" never have the "Authorization" header, i dont figure why
[09:57:05] <shoky> pe: it's not jquery doing it, it's the browser. and authorization headers are not supposed to be sent in CORS preflight requests.  you can set your server to respond to the OPTIONS request without authorization
[10:00:46] <pe> thx

[11:50:36] <alturic> Hey guys, I have a working sleep delay (the mouseleave) and I'm trying to make one for the mouseover. While the actual sleep works (it takes 1 second before it returns anything to console) it's returning toLowerCase undefined. http://jsfiddle.net/1681299r/1/ Does anyone have any thoughts? I'm almost positive it's because of the 'this' but without trying to use the sleep the actual portion works.
[11:50:36] <alturic> It's just when trying to use sleep with it.

[12:15:23] <Guest14611> Where i can do that ?
[12:19:46] <Horacsio> can I use $(this).attr('disabled','disabled'); but with enabled instead?
[12:20:33] <Uhkis> Horacsio: use prop instead

[12:22:07] <Uhkis> divs can't be disabled
[12:23:14] <Horacsio> ok so I want to remove
[12:23:32] <Horacsio> I don’t want a certain div appear in the page
[12:24:18] <Horacsio> .remove will do that, correct?

[12:31:00] <kdehl> I had the same problem for GET and POST, but those went away after I added on the server: header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
[12:31:10] <kdehl> But the problem persists for DELETE for some reason.
[12:31:52] <kdehl> I also added header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: DELETE'); but to no avail.
[12:33:32] <kdehl> I'm using a XMLHttpRequest().
[12:52:34] <kdehl> Ah, solved it. Stupid OPTIONS request method.

[21:42:55] <snover> $('#storeInfoChange form select option')[0].defaultValue
[21:44:27] <Evidlo> Is .show() different from .addClass("hidden") ?
[21:44:35] <snover> yes
[21:44:49] <Evidlo> I mean .hide() and .addClass("hidden")
[21:45:00] <snover> still yes.
[21:45:46] <Evidlo> So the second modifies the DOM and the first doesn't?
[21:46:12] <snover> they both modify the DOM.
[21:46:47] <Evidlo> So why didn't .show() work on my element with an inline 'hidden' class?
[21:47:04] <snover> i don’t know, you didn’t ask that.
[21:47:30] <snover> probably because show just removes a `display: none` style
[21:47:38] <snover> if one exists, inline
[21:47:43] <snover> which you do not have
[21:48:03] <Evidlo> So I guess I'll just use .add/removeClass()
[21:48:20] <snover> yes, that’s a better idea than using show/hide.
[22:01:55] <alturic> Hey guys, if I was to make a clock and I wanted to do something (IF statement would be used) if the time matched something I'm assuming I'd have to continously keep reiterating through a loop or something to keep checking the if statement against the clock time, no?
[22:04:07] <Audlex> google some examples
[22:29:30] <claytonzaugg> what's the best way to turn a lot of <li> nav items into a hamburger or collapsable drop down when it gets too tight?
[22:43:00] <WhirledPress> How do I check to see if an element is the last of it's siblings...(I don't know how to even ask this very well)...
[22:49:55] <WhirledPress> If I select a group of elements by class then detach one element and cycle through .each, how can I determine if each element is or isn't detached?
[22:55:34] <veek> snover /j #javascript
[22:55:48] <veek> ugh
[22:55:52] <snover> this sounds like a trap.
[22:56:02] <veek> heh
[22:56:05] <veek> sry
[22:56:31] <snover> me too if it is a trap
[22:58:21] <veek> how do i get this to work: http://jsfiddle.net/v8atbs22/8/
[22:58:34] <veek> jquery hide/unhide message
[22:58:39] <snover> by fixing it until it works
[22:59:36] <veek> yeah but i don't know what's wrong - it should work. instead when i click 'hide message' evrything disappears
[22:59:47] <veek> vs just id=message
[23:00:38] <veek> do i have to <script the jquery lib
[23:00:57] <veek> jsfiddle grumbles about it being html
[23:23:07] <WhirledPress> veek, not sure why jsfiddle is acting strange.
[23:25:03] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/v8atbs22/29/
[23:28:06] <veek> WhirledPress, solved thanks to the guys at #js :p the quotes are not what they seem
[23:28:41] <WhirledPress> I replaced all your quotes with quotes.
[23:29:12] <veek> thanks yeah checkin it out
[23:29:25] <WhirledPress> lol, except those two around hide. how funny.
[23:31:48] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/v37qsjf7/3/ How do I get the relative index of an element
[23:33:16] <veek> my JQ JS isn't good enough :(
[23:36:10] <on1x> anyone call help me with that: http://jsfiddle.net/9jj7k4h8/
[23:36:14] <on1x> im not getting the alert there
[23:36:38] <on1x> actually im getting some weird js error: Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[23:37:34] <veek> attr("data-minidump");
[23:37:52] <on1x> nop
[23:37:54] <on1x> not workin
[23:38:11] <on1x> iv read somewhere that we can just skip data-
[23:40:38] <on1x> anyone please?! ;(
[23:40:52] <WhirledPress> on1x, here's the deal. $("delete-minidump") is like saying "select the html element  delete-minidump"   which no such html element type exists. You need ".delete-minidump"
[23:41:13] <WhirledPress> the dot prefix tells jq to select the class delete-minidump
[23:41:36] <on1x> oh
[23:42:09] <WhirledPress> also, .attr("minidump") assumes there is a standard html attribute called minidump (which doesn't exist). instead you want .data("minidump");
[23:43:05] <on1x> ok
[23:43:06] <on1x> fixed both
[23:43:08] <WhirledPress> And when you setup your click handler, you have to close the parents around it by adding a ) at the end
[23:43:16] <on1x> hum
[23:43:28] <on1x> damn
[23:43:31] <on1x> im not used to js
[23:43:39] <on1x> indeed theres a parentesis missing
[23:43:44] <WhirledPress> Plus, it only will work if you select the jquery library from the cog  button in the js window
[23:43:47] <on1x> just saw
[23:44:13] <WhirledPress> Then make sure you select onDomReady for load type
[23:44:36] <on1x> you mean that: <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
[23:44:37] <on1x> ?
[23:45:22] <WhirledPress> jsfiddle handles that for you. Click the cog icon in the javascript winodw and select Jquery 2.14 from the Frameworks & Extensions field
[23:46:27] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/9jj7k4h8/5/
[23:47:05] <on1x> yeah found it
[23:47:16] <on1x> supposed to work with those changes right?
[23:48:15] <WhirledPress> are you using chrome?
[23:48:53] <on1x> yep
[23:48:55] <WhirledPress> in Chrome, open your developer tools window and select the "console" tab.
[23:49:00] <on1x> already open
[23:49:10] <WhirledPress> You can see that it works, then
[23:49:32] <on1x> it does nothing
[23:49:50] <WhirledPress> Works fine on my window. Did you look at the link I posted
[23:50:25] <on1x> oh
[23:50:27] <on1x> sry
[23:50:43] <on1x> ok
[23:50:47] <on1x> why alert window is never show?
[23:50:51] <on1x> any idea?
[23:51:03] <WhirledPress> I replaced alert with console.log....alert is terrible.
[23:51:19] <on1x> im just gonna use console from now on hehe
[23:51:47] <WhirledPress> right on, it'll make things a lot better
[23:54:14] <veek> wonder why alert wasn't working though..
[23:54:19] <WhirledPress> anybody know of a better way to get a relative index? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/v37qsjf7/4/
[23:54:45] <veek> WhirledPress, you could ass on SO (Stackoverflow)
[23:54:49] <veek> err ask
[23:54:53] <on1x> me too veek lol
[23:54:58] <on1x> thats weird, on my project it doesnt work at all
[23:55:03] <on1x> on fiddle does
[23:55:05] <on1x> damn
[23:56:00] <WhirledPress> Can't stand StackOverflow since they went all "honor-scale". Not worth the hassle to rack up enough stupid points just to answer or ask a question.
[23:57:40] <WhirledPress> just google "why shouldn't I use alert for debugging" or anything close
