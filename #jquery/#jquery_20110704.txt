[00:04:08] <Cianz> can someone help me out - I need this to work as a 2-step animation but the callback function doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/tBwjB/
[00:04:19] <Cianz> thanks in advance
[00:07:01] <timotei> hi everyone
[00:07:16] <whatter> hi timotei
[00:07:18] <timotei> I'm trying to create an array of boolean of size x. is there any easy way to do this with jquery?
[00:07:27] <timotei> instead of: var arr = new Array(false, false, fasle,..................)
[00:07:28] <timotei> ?
[00:07:49] <timotei> something like: make an array of size x, with a specific value in each field?
[00:08:08] <whatter> may i ask why are you trying to set the size?
[00:08:29] <timotei> well, I just need an array of size x (12 in my case), to hold some switches in it
[00:09:17] <whatter> var newArray = new Array (5);
[00:09:21] <whatter> or 6
[00:09:25] <whatter> or whatever the number
[00:10:22] <timotei> whatter: well, yeah, but I want to init it with a specific objec
[00:10:31] <timotei> should I just iterate and set them?
[00:10:40] <timotei> I am asking this, because I have like 4 arrays of this kind :P
[00:10:58] <whatter> so you are worrying about memory leaks? because of 4 arrays?
[00:11:14] <timotei> no. I just want to create those arrays quick :P
[00:11:45] <Cianz>  Hi everyone, i've got a problem.. I need this to work as a 2-step animation but the callback function doesn't have any effect - my code: http://jsfiddle.net/tBwjB/
[00:12:07] <whatter> timotei, yeah just start away newArray[0] = value;
[00:13:00] <r500> I want to accomplish the following tast using jquery
[00:13:02] <r500> frm_rooms.action="create_rooms.php?action=Save";
[00:13:02] <r500> frm_rooms.submit();
[00:13:30] <r500> i tried  $('#frm_rooms').submit(function(event) {	 $.post("create_rooms.php", { action: "Save" } );
[00:13:31] <r500> 									 });
[00:13:52] <iameum> r5, http://api.jquery.com/load/
[00:14:10] <whatter> Cianz, it works over here, it goes down (top:300) and then it goes up (top:0)
[00:14:25] <whatter> tested on FF5
[00:14:38] <iameum> I'm assuming something along the lines of $("#objectID").load("create_rooms.php", { 'auction': 'save' );
[00:14:51] <Cianz> hi whatter, does it do it while the mouse is hovered over when you keep it on the div?
[00:14:59] <iameum> action* lol @ (I work at an auction)
[00:15:02] <r500> iameum:  i wanted to pass value of action=save as GET; and normal submit;
[00:15:02] <Cianz> maybe its because im using opera
[00:15:36] <whatter> Cianz, it goes down when the mouse is hovering in and it goes up when it's hovering out
[00:15:41] <r500> and not as ajax kinda thing
[00:16:05] <r500> iameum:
[00:16:32] <iameum> That's why I said assume ;) I only know what I know and some times I just don't know haha
[00:16:46] <Cianz> whatter, thanks for your help - I want it to go to the middle of the 300px box (so 150px) and then to the bottom (so 300px) while the mouse is hovered, and to go back to the top (0px) when the mouse is removed
[00:17:08] <r500> xDROPx:  can u guide me on tat
[00:17:09] <r500> ?
[00:17:24] <milardovich> Hello guys
[00:17:26] <milardovich> http://pastebin.com/g5V8DwpV
[00:17:28] <milardovich> why it doesn't work?
[00:17:37] <milardovich> I mean, when I delete the no conflict mode it works
[00:20:41] <ryanseddon> milardovich: noConflict releases the $ so other scripts that are using won't conflict, you'll need to do your calls directly on the jQuery object
[00:21:23] <ryanseddon> e.g rather than $("some selector") you do jQuery("some seletor")
[00:22:11] <systemfault> If you still want the $, sandbox it :P
[00:22:40] <domino14> i called .buttonset() on a selector (jquery ui) and i get this error: "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded"
[00:22:40] <milardovich> ryanseddon: sorry, I already read that
[00:22:43] <milardovich> thanks!
[00:29:12] <Cianz> I got d/c if anyone replied to me in the past 5 minutes
[00:31:37] <Cianz> so here's my problem:complete:function works, but the function has no effect - http://jsfiddle.net/tBwjB/
[00:31:46] <Jonno_FTW> how would I get the href of an <a> tag that has been clicked from insie another function?
[00:34:03] <whatter> Cianz, so in other words, your mouse in will require 2 functions(150, then 300), and your mouse out will require one which is to set it back to where it was?
[00:34:37] <r500> xDROPx:
[00:34:48] <Cianz> whatter, thats what i want it to do
[00:35:21] <Cianz> whatter, the second function (300) doesnt work though
[00:35:31] <xDROPx> r500: what's going on?
[00:35:56] <whatter> Cianz, yes i see it now let me see what i can do
[00:36:23] <Cianz> whatter, thanks - its driving me crazy because I know it has to be something simple
[00:37:26] <dorigentoo> hi
[00:38:21] <dorigentoo> I'm getting the result of a form with $.get, and I have a problem : when the form is not valid, it still return success when I'd like to handle this case in .error() . How can I do this ?
[00:41:39] <jomofcw> Hi !
[00:42:53] <r500>  I want to accomplish the following tast using jquery
[00:42:57] <r500>  frm_rooms.action="create_rooms.php?action=Save";
[00:43:02] <r500>  frm_rooms.submit();
[00:43:07] <r500>  i tried  $('#frm_rooms').submit(function(event) {	 $.post("create_rooms.php", { action: "Save" } );
[00:44:08] <r500> iameum:  i wanted to pass value of action=save  and normal submit; its onclick event of <a id="somename"></a>
[00:44:26] <r500> xDROPx:
[00:47:02] <Jonno_FTW> My code doesn't work, I want it to load the selected page but nothing happens, http://pastebin.ws/5m9290
[00:49:29] <xDROPx> r500: that seems like it should work - could you tell where the problem was?
[00:49:51] <xDROPx> r500: whether it was in the submit event triggering the function, or posting the form?
[00:53:19] <whatter> Cianz, i updated it for you, it's working now
[00:53:43] <Cianz> whatter, thanks for your help!
[00:54:59] <whatter> Cianz, you are welcome
[00:55:16] <whatter> and if you need to understand what i did you can message me in private :)
[00:55:19] <Jonno_FTW> I'm still stuck
[00:55:30] <r500> if i put normal $('#frm_rooms').submit();; the form gets submitted xDROPx
[00:56:02] <r500> xDROPx: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6568489/form-submit-using-jquery-passing-values
[01:00:33] <xDROPx> wow - and none of those work for you r500?
[01:01:03] <xDROPx> if you want the page to get submitted you should not be using $.post in the submit
[01:01:13] <r500> huh..!!?
[01:01:16] <r500> then
[01:01:22] <xDROPx> do you you just need a hidden form field for action=save?
[01:01:38] <xDROPx> $.post is an AJAX post - it doesn't submit the form and reload the entire page
[01:02:18] <BlankVerse> i have a jquery function to append stuff into a praticular textarea , and i have another jquery script to load the tinymce editor , how do i load the editor after the textarea has been appended?
[01:02:30] <r500> awww.. m so silly.. hidde field can do that
[01:02:37] <BlankVerse> or is there a way to refresh the tinymce editor
[01:02:46] <BlankVerse> to show the data appended in textarea
[01:02:47] <r500> but i wonder frm_rooms.action="create_rooms.php?action=Save";
[01:02:47] <r500> frm_rooms.submit();
[01:02:48] <r500> return true;
[01:03:08] <r500> is ther any equivalent of  the second line in jquery
[01:03:14] <r500> xDROPx:
[01:04:11] <xDROPx> that second line should work - assuming frm_rooms is a jquery element
[01:04:31] <xDROPx> $("#frm_rooms").submit() would submit the frm_rooms form
[01:05:27] <xDROPx> if what you want to do is the action of the form dynamically you might want to do : $("#frm_rooms").attr("action", "create_rooms.php?action=Save")
[01:05:40] <r500> oops sorry not second line; i meant this one; is there any equivalent of it in jquery---- frm_rooms.action="create_rooms.php?action=Save";
[01:06:04] <r500> ahh... xDROPx wll try that
[01:06:07] <xDROPx> the last thing i said
[01:06:11] <xDROPx> cool
[01:06:12] <r500> yeah i maent that thing
[01:06:22] <r500> thanks dear :)
[01:06:26] <xDROPx> sure np
[01:06:27] <NirQ> hello.. problem with jQuery 1.6.2 and jstree
[01:06:31] <xDROPx> hope it works :)
[01:06:36] <whatter> i've been reading r500 question over and over and i just figured out all he/she wanted to do was to set the form's action attribute! is that you want r500?
[01:06:39] <r500> lets see :)
[01:06:58] <r500> whatter:  yup
[01:07:15] <NirQ> seems to be related to the latest cameliz fix in 07420566452622f37b01e69bbbdcbeeb5317e065
[01:07:36] <r500> (1:35:27 PM) xDROPx:   whatter thats wat i require i guess. will giv it a try n let u nknwo
[01:08:03] <Laerti> http://testela.al/ how can i make the content slider slides the same time with the website slider?
[01:09:18] <r500> xDROPx:  worked :) thanks
[01:09:25] <xDROPx> w00t! :)
[01:10:08] <r500> :D .. will post the sol on stackoverflow thnks
[01:10:47] <xDROPx> sweet
[01:11:15] <whatter> BlankVerse, try adding $(selector).live() since your text area was appended
[01:11:54] <Laerti> http://testela.al/ how can i make the content slider slides the same time with the website slider?      any idea please
[01:12:33] <whatter> BlankVerse, the live would work with "newly" added tags/elements, so if you added a button to the DOM at a later stage, and you want to bind a click to it, you have to go $('.button_class').live('click',function(){ //Stuff});
[01:13:50] <BlankVerse> $('textarea','form').live()
[01:13:55] <BlankVerse> whatter: doesnt work
[01:14:37] <iameum> Whatter, your solution for blankverse worked for what I was wondering about. I guess I came back at the right time from my walk lol
[01:15:42] <iameum> I guess what I was trying to say is thanks!
[01:37:12] <simulation> guys is it possible to stop setInterval if page not focused ?
[01:54:33] <simulation> helloo ?
[01:54:44] <gar_onn> hey
[01:57:11] <simulation> how can i know if the page is on visible tab or passive tab ?
[02:00:01] <Kambfhase> simulation: there is no explicit method to check that.
[02:00:45] <simulation> Kambfhase: i have coded a slider and it goes mad after 5 mins inactivity :D
[02:00:57] <Kambfhase> o.O
[02:00:59] <simulation> Kambfhase: how can i prevent that ?
[02:01:08] <Kambfhase> use the jquery ui slider
[02:01:49] <Kambfhase> or you can use ssetImeout to do something after 5 min
[02:01:58] <simulation> Kambfhase: its not usefull to change it :S
[02:02:06] <simulation> Kambfhase: if page is active
[02:02:56] <r3v3rb> morning all
[02:03:16] <Kambfhase> ho
[02:03:32] <simulation> Kambfhase:  it works well and if tab is inactive for example im viewin facebook and the passive tab has my page after coupl mins inactivity i check my page and i saw hat my slider goes mad :D
[02:04:12] <r3v3rb> http://m-spacehosting.com/~t10g1h11/
[02:04:45] <r3v3rb> chrome = no nivo slider working, firefox - image pops then does the effect - weird. Any ideas?
[02:35:31] <Laerti> http://testela.al/ how can i make the content slider slides the same time with the website slider?      any idea please
[02:35:32] <Laerti> http://testela.al/ how can i make the content slider slides the same time with the website slider?      any idea please

[02:40:16] <mattalexx> Why is this selector: $("a[href*=.pdf]")
[02:40:38] <mattalexx> Not finding this HTML?: Here's a <a href="/html-assets/_pdf_Spring08_ArgonXenonOM.pdf">PDF link</a>
[02:41:20] <Laerti> tilqi__w: thats what i have used but i want to integrate that with the webiste big slider
[02:42:08] <Laerti> to work at the same time
[02:44:32] <mattalexx> nvm, it needed quotes
[02:44:37] <mattalexx> $('a[href*=".pdf"]')

[03:11:33] <Giverny> how i make this http://paste.lymas.com.br/2041

[03:11:50] <Giverny> ajpiano
[03:11:55] <Giverny> do you know ?
[03:20:10] <guy> I have list of elements <ul> <li /><li /><li /><li /><li /> </ul>
[03:20:28] <clockwize> hey guys, is there any tool available to query json objects? (e.g. I have a massive JSON array result, i want to sort, filter etc to find out if the data is correct)
[03:20:45] <guy> one of the <li /> are triggered with hover(). how do I tell which one it is: 1st, 2nd?
[03:22:24] <Kambfhase> ?g json path @ clockwize
[03:22:25] <bot-t> clockwize, JSONPath - XPath for JSON - http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/
[03:22:34] <clockwize> ah, awesome :)
[03:22:49] <Kambfhase> guy: this
[03:22:51] <guy> should I do something like $('li:before').length?
[03:23:00] <guy> Kambfhase: this what?
[03:23:32] <Kambfhase> $('li').hover(function(){ this /* the element that was hovered*/ })
[03:25:17] <Giverny> how i make this? http://paste.lymas.com.br/2041
[03:25:47] <Giverny> animate 1, animate 2, animate 3 ?
[03:25:49] <guy> Kambfhase: no, I mean I need to get the number of which element it is
[03:25:59] <Kambfhase> $(this).index()
[03:26:16] <Giverny> inside setInterval( ,1000); ?
[03:32:19] <emilianoheyns> I am looking for a way to have specific drop targets be valid for individual items in a sortable lists. The lists are currently connected using connectWith, but I've found no way to have a "item-specific" connectWith, or a way to detect that a non-valid target is selected and cancel the drop.
[03:36:13] <ablomen> emilianoheyns, look at accept in the docs
[03:36:57] <emilianoheyns> ablomen: I've looked at that but I've been unable to get it to work. How do I cancel from that function?
[03:37:45] <ablomen> emilianoheyns, like the "Revert draggable position" example?
[03:38:40] <emilianoheyns> ablomen: Sure sounds like it, but I don't see it in the list of demos for sortable?
[03:38:54] <KeirLav> does .val() of an input return a text string?
[03:39:19] <ablomen> Embalmed, droppable
[03:39:25] <ablomen> woops
[03:39:33] <ablomen> emilianoheyns, see the droppable docs
[03:39:39] <jetienne> in jquery mobile, what 'swatch' means ? no dictionnary i tried seems to contain it
[03:39:42] <ablomen> i think it should work
[03:41:16] <emilianoheyns> ablomen: that looks like what I want to do, but that doesn't use the accept feature right?
[03:41:52] <ablomen> well you can combine it
[03:41:55] <ablomen> i guess
[03:43:10] <emilianoheyns> I'll try dynamically setting the revert option. I have to set that on the item being dragged?
[03:43:32] <ablomen> not sure, the code in that example should help
[03:43:36] <emilianoheyns> So that's the item from the sortable, or the helper?
[03:55:50] <KeirLav> if i create a var from a val() then use appendTo to place it in the page, the variable still holds its value doesnt it?
[03:56:12] <KeirLav> no need for clone at any point is there?
[03:57:05] <dorigentoo> I'm getting the result of a form with $.get, and I have a problem : when the form is not valid, it still return success when I'd like to handle this case in .error() . How can I do this ?
[03:57:56] <coldhead> you are right KeirLav, the value is preserved
[03:59:12] <stenno_at_work> dorigentoo, what do you mean with 'not valid' ?
[03:59:35] <coldhead> dorigentoo: can you get the server to return an error? with an error code other than 200 OK?
[04:00:16] <stenno_at_work> iirc if its .error or .success is determined solely by the HTTP Response
[04:00:28] <stenno_at_work> what coldhead said
[04:01:00] <stenno_at_work> HTTP Response Code
[04:01:39] <jetienne> in jquery mobile, what 'swatch' means ? no dictionnary i tried seems to contain it
[04:01:57] <markj> ?define swatch
[04:01:59] <bot-t> markj, swatch - (noun) A piece, pattern, or sample, generally of cloth or a similar material.
[04:02:30] <markj> not sure about what it means in context though, not used much jqmobile
[04:03:11] <aaronmcadam> jetienne, a 'swatch' is a group of colours that compliment each other
[04:03:18] <aaronmcadam> in jquery mobile
[04:05:42] <Cradam> anyone know a simple gmaps jquery plugin?
[04:08:18] <Cradam> http://www.mayzes.org/fragments/new/simple.html hmm strange the demo isnt working
[04:08:59] <jsor> any (plugin)devs have opinions about http://forum.jquery.com/topic/best-practices-with-plugin-specific-methods ?
[04:12:45] <guy> has anyone know anything about person AppEngineer? is he old member of jQuery community?
[04:12:56] <dytrivedi> Lampoon: seen madmonkey
[04:12:56] <Lampoon> Sorry, I haven't seen madmonkey.
[04:13:17] <lkeijser> hi, i'm using the colorbox plugin to display a form. Problem is that when i hit the submit button in my form, the POST data isn't sent to the page. Do i have to handle this differently?
[04:16:42] <dannyv> am i being dumb? if I create a DIV with the ID foo using append(),  I can't use $('#foo') to access it? Is there somewhere I can read up on this - I've had a dig, and a google, but I'm not really sure what to search for in the documnetation
[04:17:06] <dannyv> (thanks in advance, obviously!)
[04:17:08] <Kambfhase> ?p @ dannyv
[04:17:08] <bot-t> dannyv, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:18:36] <dannyv> http://jsfiddle.net/RPCy4/
[04:18:37] <dagon666> hello, is it possible to print the json code with jquery the same way it is produced by php json_encode() function ?
[04:19:19] <dannyv> on jsfiddle as requested
[04:19:22] <Kambfhase> dannyv: the problem is, you request $('#foo') before it is in the page!
[04:19:59] <Kambfhase> either us .live() or bind the event after you added the element
[04:20:56] <SilentPenguin> that and $("#bar") doesn't exist, so appending to it will do nothing
[04:21:07] <Kambfhase> dannyv: http://jsfiddle.net/RPCy4/1/
[04:21:09] <dannyv> sorry, #bar was created in HTML
[04:21:40] <dannyv> thanks Kambhhase - that looks very promising!
[04:21:46] <Kambfhase> :)
[04:22:36] <SilentPenguin> if you wish to apply an event to something that does not exist, you need to use "live", otherwise (and more likely given you are using id's) create your events after you create what you are matching against
[04:22:56] <dannyv> what a great resource - thanks guys
[04:29:26] <atroubledman> hi, i have a simple slidetoggle action onclick, that toggles a div with 3 paragraphs inside
[04:29:46] <atroubledman> the problem is, that the toggle slides well until the first paraph finishes, and it then jumps rapidly to the end of the div
[04:29:55] <atroubledman> what do you think can be the cause of that?
[04:30:27] <markj> ?g jquery for designers animation jump @ atroubledman

[04:59:16] <HannesP> excellent Kambfhase, thank you very much

[05:00:08] <guy> can anyone explain me what causes the "c is undefined" error http://anuary.com/dev/hp/pad2/
[05:01:36] <stenno_at_work> guy, i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[05:01:49] <guy> browser?
[05:01:51] <ravenzz> me too
[05:01:51] <JKarsrud> chrome
[05:02:00] <stenno_at_work> chrome here too
[05:02:11] <stenno_at_work> from jquery.min.js line 16
[05:02:21] <stenno_at_work> :O
[05:02:23] <Me-Selfe> well, i guess its because its undefined? :)
[05:02:37] <Kambfhase> your loop with the ajax call within looks suspicious
[05:03:26] <stenno_at_work> my first guess would be that the data returned from the request is not the one that you are expecting
[05:04:12] <stenno_at_work> guy, what does jslint say?
[05:04:35] <guy> stenno_at_work: will check everything in a second. too many questions at once. : )
[05:04:42] <stenno_at_work> :P
[05:04:48] <stenno_at_work> just a blind guess though
[05:05:51] <stenno_at_work> when entering something in the box end pressing 'enter', i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'match' of undefined
[05:05:59] <stenno_at_work> in default.js:42
[05:06:41] <guy> stenno_at_work: this is not the issue; simply not done yet.
[05:07:01] <stenno_at_work> ok
[05:08:14] <stenno_at_work> the little 'stacktrace' provided by chrome suggests the error to be in the success function
[05:08:20] <stenno_at_work> if i interpreted that correctly
[05:08:33] <Me-Selfe> also, not using the compressed jquery version will help alot..
[05:08:45] <Me-Selfe> "line 16" doesn't help much when everything is there :)
[05:08:54] <stenno_at_work> :)
[05:09:36] <stenno_at_work> 'stacktrace' says this line:
[05:09:38] <stenno_at_work>                videos  = $.merge(videos,data.feed.entry);
[05:11:50] <guy> I found it already, guys .. one of the data.feed.entry was empty.
[05:11:54] <guy> undefined*
[05:12:04] <stenno_at_work> ah!
[05:12:21] <guy> is it possible to change error reporting level on JS? so it would report everything?
[05:12:37] <guy> even deprecated/considered bad practise, etc.
[05:12:59] <Kambfhase> JS was design to accept even the badest code
[05:13:14] <stenno_at_work> s/badest/worst
[05:13:29] <stenno_at_work> guy, also jslint :P
[05:13:31] <Kambfhase> you can use JSLint, JShint or jQueryLint to check if your code follows the good pratices
[05:13:55] <guy> stenno_at_work: I know about jslint, though it is not available as a plugin nor for firebug nor for Coda.
[05:19:03] <guy> why wouldn't $('input').keyup('search'); work? there is function name function search(){} in the global scope & what is the closest alternative? keyup(function(){ search(); }); is not really an option because I will loose $(this) unless I will pass it as a parameter.
[05:19:57] <ablomen> guy, $("input").keyup(search); (without the quotes)
[05:20:32] <ablomen> and, btw, you can always use function.apply to set what this means, just so you know
[05:20:35] <Snoopal> i am selecting checkboxes over their "class" attribute. Now is the question how i am able to get its values?
[05:21:28] <Kambfhase> .val()
[05:21:43] <Snoopal> hmm
[05:21:44] <Snoopal> kk
[05:22:14] <Anticom> hi all
[05:22:30] <Snoopal> can i use this.val() in a .each() function?
[05:22:46] <guy> ablomen: thank you.
[05:22:49] <Kambfhase> yes
[05:22:55] <Snoopal> thanks
[05:23:44] <Anticom> i've got a problem with .data() li {     list-style-type: none;     border: 1px solid black;     margin: 5px;     background-color: #ccc;     padding-left: 5px; } input .edit {     background-color: red; } ul {     float: left;     min-height: 100px;     min-width: 200px;     padding: 10px; } ul#use {     background-color: #6EE768; } ul#notuse {     background-color: #f55; } span#lower {     clear: both; }
[05:23:46] <Anticom> oops
[05:23:54] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/Ead6k/ *
[05:24:20] <Anticom> when i'm editing a field and press ESC the original data should be restored and put back into the li-element
[05:24:37] <Anticom> but when i try to do that, the li is empty afterwards =/
[05:25:44] <BlankVerse> what is the best way to display data in tinymce?
[05:27:58] <guy> http://anuary.com/dev/hp/pad2/
[05:28:15] <guy> how do I make videos var available in function search(){} context?
[05:28:16] <BlankVerse> it starts with a textarea but on WYSIWYG editing , it stores it in an iframe
[05:28:35] <Kambfhase> Anticom: take the current text, added it to the element via .data() and restore it later
[05:28:58] <stenno_at_work> guy, declare it global, or even better, use jquery.extend
[05:29:21] <Anticom> that's what i'm doing and what i'm using for the "reset names" button, Kambfhase
[05:29:46] <Kambfhase> whoops :o
[05:29:58] <stenno_at_work> you can declare a variable global in javascript by by declaring it without 'var'
[05:30:02] <stenno_at_work> var test = 23;
[05:30:19] <stenno_at_work> (test is only available in current scope and subscopes)
[05:30:24] <stenno_at_work> test = 23;
[05:30:26] <Kambfhase> stenno_at_work: are u mad?
[05:30:44] <stenno_at_work> (if test wasn't defined it will be moved to the global scope)
[05:30:51] <stenno_at_work> Kambfhase, yeah its ugly
[05:30:55] <stenno_at_work> bad practice
[05:30:58] <stenno_at_work> practise
[05:31:02] <stenno_at_work> erm
[05:31:03] <Kambfhase> you can declare a variable global in javascript by by declaring it without 'var' << you just migrated to the dark side
[05:31:09] <stenno_at_work> use $.extend
[05:31:26] <stenno_at_work> for global variables :)
[05:31:49] <stenno_at_work> Kambfhase, technically its true
[05:32:12] <Kambfhase> and in ES5?
[05:32:28] <stenno_at_work> i don't think so, imho its a design flaw
[05:52:39] <Jonno_FTW> I have a question
[05:53:31] <stenno_at_work> what could that question be...?
[05:53:41] <Kambfhase> to ask or not to ask
[05:54:00] <Jonno_FTW> when I load in some new html through ajax, my .click functions don't worko n the new content
[05:54:12] <stenno_at_work> Jonno_FTW, use .live
[05:54:18] <stenno_at_work> like this:
[05:54:29] <stenno_at_work> $(elem).live("click", handler);
[05:54:36] <Kambfhase> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[05:55:06] <stenno_at_work> oh
[05:57:07] <Jonno_FTW> I'm pretty new to this, so how would I fix up this code: http://pastebin.ws/bnl2dg
[05:57:39] <Jonno_FTW> basically I'm loading in more .link and they need the handler too
[05:58:03] <Kambfhase> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[05:59:36] <stenno_at_work> Jonno_FTW, jQuery(".link").live("click", function() { var title....
[05:59:46] <stenno_at_work> read Kambfhase 's link
[06:00:05] <Jonno_FTW> I have
[06:00:11] <Jonno_FTW> I think I get it now thanks
[06:00:20] <stenno_at_work> np
[06:02:30] <Snoopal> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/822778760 can me some one tell me why the function where every checkbox value is checked does not alert("1") ? i know that the function above is triggered
[06:03:03] <stenno_at_work> Snoopal, #php
[06:03:30] <Snoopal> stenno_at_work no this is just for creating some values for the array, ignore that, that works
[06:04:01] <stenno_at_work> "input.vormittag[type=checkbox][checked]" is that a correct selector...?
[06:04:39] <Snoopal> input.vormittag[type=checkbox] works fine and after some research in internet that should be a correct one
[06:04:42] <stenno_at_work> is tag defined?
[06:04:42] <Snoopal> other suggestions ?
[06:05:52] <stenno_at_work> wait
[06:05:58] <stenno_at_work> where is the function even called
[06:06:11] <stenno_at_work> isn't it just an anonymous function ...?
[06:06:31] <Snoopal> yes
[06:06:44] <Snoopal> it just should start by it self
[06:06:50] <stenno_at_work> so why should it be called...?
[06:07:13] <stenno_at_work> no, i think you have to add () after the function declaration to get it called...?
[06:07:44] <Snoopal> what do you mean?
[06:08:17] <stenno_at_work> from vanilla js, i know this:
[06:08:35] <stenno_at_work> (function() { alert("23");})();
[06:08:57] <stenno_at_work> will call that anonymous function
[06:10:09] <stenno_at_work> hmm
[06:10:36] <stenno_at_work> indeed, $(function() {alert("23")}); gets called directly
[06:10:44] <stenno_at_work> so you don't need ()
[06:11:23] <stenno_at_work> so maybe the selector just returns an empty list
[06:12:24] <stenno_at_work> or kontingent-tag breaks because tag is not defined
[06:12:33] <stenno_at_work> at least i can't find it in your code
[06:13:49] <stenno_at_work> can you check in your browsers development console if the selector returns somethign?
[06:17:12] <stenno_at_work> Snoopal, anything new?
[06:18:31] <guy> what's the name of the plugin responsible for delaying requests? for instance when used with autocomplete.
[06:18:40] <guy> it is something like "bouncer" .. ?
[06:19:51] <guy> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[06:20:21] <guy> jquery doesn't have yet anything native to do this, right?
[06:21:57] <Kcharle> can anyone help me out? im using this script http://pastebin.com/0gAkx4Wb - to have a panel of content appear when i click on a link on my page, my problem is when i click 1 link then click another , the first panel stays open and blocks the second one, is there a way to make the first one dispear?
[06:22:30] <stenno_at_work> guy, if there is a plugin, i guess jquery can't do naturally
[06:22:47] <guy> it is pretty old one and pretty useful one, that's why I am asking.
[06:23:07] <stenno_at_work> guy, but maybe setTimeout or setInterval from vanilla js may help you
[06:23:18] <guy> nop, that would be too complicated.
[06:23:35] <guy> throttle is enough
[06:39:20] <guy> when should I use $.fn.extend and when $.extend?
[06:43:14] <stenno_at_work> guy. $.fn.extend for functions, $.extend for variables iirc
[06:44:44] <guy> mind commenting the code a bit?
[06:44:45] <guy> http://anuary.com/dev/hp/pad2/
[06:45:02] <guy> for any obvious flaws
[06:46:16] <stenno_at_work> {alt: 'json', 'max-results': 50},
[06:46:30] <stenno_at_work> isn't it 'alt'
[06:46:36] <stenno_at_work> instead of alt
[06:46:43] <stenno_at_work> but it doesn't really matter
[06:47:21] <KeirLav> when a radio input is changed i am storing the value of the checked radio in the group as a variable, and trying to make the value of a hidden input the value of this checked radio
[06:47:51] <KeirLav> i am storing the value simply as doing value = $(input).val();
[06:48:50] <KeirLav> however when i do $(input2).val(value); - then make a var like value2 = $(input2).val(); and alert(value2); i get undefined, why is this please anyone?
[06:50:38] <KeirLav> can anyone help me with this please?
[06:51:23] <guy> stenno_at_work: afaik, there is no difference.
[06:52:00] <KeirLav> lol silly me made a typo in the new input
[06:52:01] <stenno_at_work> yeah
[06:52:04] <KeirLav> nevermind guys
[06:54:30] <PrinceES> Is there any sript for playing flv videos on the jquery slider?
[06:54:46] <PrinceES> or any tutorial for it...
[06:55:11] <Kambfhase> errr, what?
[06:55:38] <guy> stenno_at_work: so no comments aside that?
[06:56:23] <stenno_at_work> i didn't look to deep into it, i got other stuff to do too, sorry
[06:58:13] <BMCouto> whats the best way to call new pages with $.ajax() with links to new css files?
[06:58:19] <BMCouto> doesnt seem to work fine in IE
[07:08:46] <DoctorDarren> Hey, I want to select all elements with the class 'spf-identifier' that do NOT also have the class 'dynamically-added', is this correct?: $('.spf-identifier:not(.dynamically-added)')
[07:10:01] <timing> corycollier: yes
[07:10:17] <timing> DoctorDarren: yes
[07:10:24] <timing> corycollier: sorry wrong hilight
[07:10:33] <DoctorDarren> timing: Thanks :)
[07:11:05] <timing> DoctorDarren: but I would do it like this: $('.spf-identifier').not('.dynamically-added');
[07:14:46] <PrinceES> Is there any sript for playing flv videos on the jquery slider?
[07:14:48] <PrinceES> or any tutorial for it...
[07:18:51] <DoctorDarren> timer: Ah, will do that then thanks
[07:19:02] <DoctorDarren> timer: Wrong username oops
[07:19:08] <DoctorDarren> timing: Will do that thanks!
[07:27:34] <corycollier> timing: haha, just saw that
[07:27:59] <timing> corycollier: look how DoctorDarren hilighted me afterwards :-)
[07:28:48] <symfonyMan> hello
[07:30:54] <corycollier> timing: Apparently it's a quick typing kind of day.
[07:37:26] <symfonyMan> how to display popup with jquery ?
[07:37:51] <Bittarman> symfonyMan, pick up your display... and pop it up in the air!
[07:37:53] <Bittarman> :)
[07:37:59] <symfonyMan> display data returned from ajax request
[07:38:03] <symfonyMan> :)
[07:38:22] <Bittarman> seriously though.. like this http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[07:39:01] <symfonyMan> yes i saw that
[07:39:20] <symfonyMan> but i don't know to integrate it with this code :
[07:39:22] <symfonyMan> $(document).ready(function() {
[07:39:22] <symfonyMan> 		
[07:39:22] <symfonyMan> 		$('.NewMessage').click(function(){
[07:39:22] <symfonyMan> 			$('#messageForm').empty();
[07:39:22] <symfonyMan> 			var receiver = $('.receiver').val();
[07:39:22] <symfonyMan> 			var url = $(this).attr('href');				
[07:39:22] <symfonyMan> 			$.post(url,{ receiver : receiver }, function(data) {
[07:39:23] <symfonyMan> 					$('#messageForm').prepend(data);
[07:39:23] <symfonyMan> 				});
[07:39:24] <symfonyMan> 			return false;
[07:39:24] <symfonyMan> 		});
[07:39:25] <symfonyMan> })
[07:41:17] <Bittarman> symfonyMan, use a pastebin for code!
[07:41:44] <Bittarman> and take the response, put it in the content of the ui dialog.. and then display the dialog.
[07:42:49] <symfonyMan> ok thanks Bittarman
[07:42:53] <symfonyMan> i will try this
[07:44:46] <danieliser> any body know of a way to get the ui.draggable element id? in droppable drop function?
[07:45:14] <danieliser> tried attr('id'), .id()
[07:45:20] <danieliser> and several other methods
[07:45:28] <BMCouto> has anyone ever called new pages with $.ajax() that have a link to a new css file? gets messed up in IE...
[07:46:50] <ravenzz> BMCouto could you provide us a live example?
[07:47:10] <PrinceES> Is there any sript for playing flv videos on the jquery slider? just like as http://www.mcfc.co.uk/
[07:47:47] <timing> PrinceES: I don't see a vid on that page
[07:49:06] <KeirLav> how would i go about disabling a checkbox until a textarea has been scrolled to the bottom?
[07:50:05] <KeirLav> anyone?
[07:50:23] <PrinceES> <timing> there are video on the slider ... go to last tab of banner...
[07:50:28] <PrinceES> then you can see a video
[07:51:08] <MoTiOnXml> how would you reload a page without potentially posting twice?
[07:51:31] <MoTiOnXml> i'm currently using document.location.reload() but i'd like to ensure no re-posting; i.e. a clean "GET"
[07:51:38] <Bittarman> MoTiOnXml, always respond to POST requests with a reditect.
[07:51:50] <Bittarman> it has to be done serverside really.
[07:51:52] <MoTiOnXml> Bittarman: you don't get me, I think :)
[07:51:57] <PrinceES> <timing> also you can see on it.. http://demo.awkwardgroup.com/showcase/
[07:52:02] <Bittarman> though you can safely not do that on xhr requests.
[07:52:06] <BlaDe> hi guys, not sure if this is a css question or not... however:
[07:52:06] <PrinceES> on the number 8 .. there is a video
[07:52:07] <MoTiOnXml> IFrame does something, the closes itself and wants to reload parent window
[07:52:23] <MoTiOnXml> Bittarman: i'm talking entirely client-side
[07:52:31] <Bittarman> MoTiOnXml, you can't.
[07:52:37] <MoTiOnXml> sure
[07:52:39] <Bittarman> other than changing window.location
[07:52:41] <PrinceES> i have some flv video.. and want to watch them on the jquery slider...
[07:52:41] <gurumelo> Hello, do somebody know how can i apply this http://code.google.com/intl/es-ES/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/overlays.html#StyledMaps to this http://labs.mario.ec/jquery-gmap/ ?
[07:52:42] <MoTiOnXml> usually one does location.href += random number
[07:52:57] <KeirLav> i mean i know i can listen for the scoll of the textarea but how to tell when its been scrolled to the bottom?
[07:53:00] <PrinceES> <Bittarman> any idea?
[07:53:07] <Bittarman> you can't simply 'refresh' the page like the browser refresh button, and not expect it to repost posted data
[07:53:16] <BlaDe> I have a container, say, 220px. I have li's inside at width 110px, and when you hover over 1 li it adds an 'active' class which sets position:absolute and width:220px to show you the entire name (overflow:hidden). My problem is, because of the absolute the item from below jumps up a row temporairily and it looks clunky - can I fix that?
[07:53:18] <DoctorDarren> How would I apply a pseudo selector to $(this)?
[07:53:23] <MoTiOnXml> Bittarman: yea, exactly, just wanted to check if there was a "no-pragma" kind of js reload
[07:53:34] <DoctorDarren> $(this:first-child) or $('this:first-child') ?
[07:53:41] <PrinceES> if you go to this example...... http://superleagueformula.com/
[07:53:53] <PrinceES> there is a banner but it is in flash
[07:53:58] <PrinceES> i want to make it in jquery
[07:54:33] <gurumelo> search and learn PrinceES
[07:54:48] <gurumelo> search "video slider jquery"
[07:55:05] <KeirLav> anyone at all help me trigger an event when a text area is scrolled to the bottom?
[07:55:05] <gurumelo> ?.videoslider
[07:55:06] <PrinceES> i tried.. but couldnt find any specific one
[07:55:09] <bot-t> gurumelo, galery slider audio video | jQuery Plugins - non obstrusive and accessible portfolio supporting multiple media : photos, video (youtube & flv), audio (mp3), pdf. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/galery-slider-audio-video
[07:59:06] <gurumelo> PrinceES: also you can probe "loopedslider"
[07:59:20] <gurumelo> any slider is valid, put into videos.
[07:59:56] <KeirLav> how can i get the full height of a text area if it wasn't scrollable?
[08:01:06] <danieliser> when dropping a droppable how can i get the dropped items id?
[08:01:14] <jgarrido> keirlav, what height does it currently give you?
[08:01:52] <gurumelo> textarea.height()
[08:02:00] <jgarrido> danieliser, it should be listed in the docs
[08:02:04] <BlaDe> any ideas about my question guys?
[08:03:05] <gurumelo> which is your question BlaDe ?
[08:03:13] <danieliser> jgarrida: ive tried what is suggested in there.. says it it should be in ui.draggable..  http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/JAz5y/1/
[08:03:34] <BlaDe> guru: I have a ul with width 220px. I have li's inside at 110px each (so 2 per row), and when you hover over 1 li it adds an 'active' class which sets position:absolute and width:220px to show you the entire name (overflow:hidden). My problem is, because of the absolute the item from below jumps up a row temporairily and it looks clunky - any suggestions how to fix it?
[08:04:14] <jgarrido> blade, I wouldn't recommend setting the position for that purpose.
[08:04:38] <gurumelo> can you probe with animate and width?
[08:04:43] <gurumelo> or position: relative?
[08:04:52] <jgarrido> a tooltip may suffice
[08:05:22] <BlaDe> hmm I did't really want to make a tooltip, I wante to extend the width but without breaking the layout
[08:05:33] <jgarrido> or use some sort if overlayed element
[08:05:46] <BlaDe> jgarrido what if I cloned it, set absolute and width?
[08:05:49] <BlaDe> then deleted it
[08:06:01] <jgarrido> and that way you could even animate it
[08:06:40] <gurumelo> BlaDe: which is your navigator?
[08:06:48] <BlaDe> gurumelo navigator?
[08:06:56] <jgarrido> I don't think the cloning thing would work, you'd probably still have the dame jumping problem
[08:07:03] <gurumelo> browser web
[08:07:06] <jgarrido> * same
[08:07:08] <BlaDe> jgarrido why, the originals would all be there still
[08:07:11] <BlaDe> gurumelo chrome mainly
[08:07:34] <jgarrido> ugh, irc on a cell phone = meh
[08:07:46] <BlaDe> yeah... get an iPad ;)
[08:07:47] <MoTiOnXml> feels like the API i'm writing here in C# will become the equivalent of the Dark Side in Star Wars
[08:07:54] <MoTiOnXml> feel evil, unstoppable
[08:08:11] <gurumelo> ipad is shit
[08:08:14] <ryanneufeld> MoTiOnXml: but it's fatal flaw will be over confidence
[08:08:38] <jgarrido> blade, true, but youd be adding an additional element to the collection (li), so the rest may shift to accomadate
[08:08:49] <BlaDe> jgarrido even if it's position:absolute ?
[08:09:10] <jgarrido> hmm, not sure
[08:09:36] <jgarrido> for that matter though, it doesnt necessarily have to be a div
[08:09:37] <gurumelo> show the code blade
[08:09:44] <jgarrido> i mean li
[08:10:08] <jgarrido> unless its helpful for styling reasons
[08:10:13] <BlaDe> jgarrido well yeah, it's a list
[08:10:33] <jgarrido> i suppose its worth a shot, wouldnt hurt to try
[08:11:19] <BlaDe> gurumelo:         li.hover( function() { $(this).append($(this).clone().addClass('active').animate({height: '272px'})); }, function() { $('.bit-box.active').remove });
[08:11:30] <BlaDe> missed a (), oops:) haven't tested it yet.
[08:13:42] <KeirLav>  baffling me this one, can anyone help me to determine when a text area has been scrolled to the bottom?
[08:14:07] <BlaDe> KeirLav scrollY and height? combined maybe?
[08:16:10] <beginner> hi everyone
[08:16:38] <BlaDe> jgarrido it's mostly working, actually... But it animates to the width then goes back straight away
[08:16:39] <BlaDe> any ideas why?
[08:16:47] <BlaDe> $(this).parent().append($(this).clone().addClass('active').animate({width: '272px'}, 500));

[08:17:35] <beginner> i want to remove the [ ] at the begnining and the end of the return value
[08:17:37] <beginner> how can i do that ?
[08:17:55] <rogy> The pilot episode for the FOX series "The Lone Gunmen" Which first aired on March 4, 2001. The plot envisioned the US Government hijacking a plane and crashing it into the World Trade Center.
[08:18:05] <rogy> Believe it or not, this show was on the air Tuesday nights on one of the TV channels in Australia in the weeks leading up to September 11 2001, and when the first images of the Twin Towers attack came on the screen on Tuesday night local time I actually wondered if it was a continuation of the Lone Gunman series. Obviously after a while it became obvious it was a news report but the co-incidence
[08:18:05] <rogy> freaked me out at the time. I don't know ifï»¿ anyone else in Australia noticed this but I certainly did

[08:19:12] <j_wright> wasn't it remote controlled?
[08:21:10] <glen1> does anyone know how to select an element when I click on it?
[08:21:38] <glen1> I have tried using the delegate function but it selects the div that the element (<h1>) is in
[08:22:23] <systemfault> glen1: What do you mean?
[08:22:36] <systemfault> glen1: What means "select" in that context?
[08:22:48] <glen1> just say I have the html struct <div><h1>hello world</h1></div>
[08:23:17] <gurumelo> <div id="guapeton...
[08:23:31] <glen1> how can I add a class to the <h1> element when i click on it?
[08:23:42] <glen1> I mean select, meaning to use it
[08:23:46] <gurumelo> $('#guapeton').click.......
[08:24:34] <KeirLav> how do i bind to the event of someone scrolling a text area?
[08:24:46] <KeirLav> $('textarea').scroll(function(){
[08:24:50] <KeirLav> is not working
[08:25:40] <glen1> but the problem gets harder when there are multiple div parents <div><div><p>hey ...
[08:25:52] <gurumelo> KeirLav: why don't you use an auto-expanding textarea?
[08:26:06] <glen1> then the delegate functions returns <div><div><p>
[08:26:14] <gurumelo> ?.autoexpandingtextarea
[08:26:15] <bot-t> gurumelo, textarea Auto Expand | jQuery Plugins - Another clone of the facebook textarea. Used $("textarea").autoExpand() with an optional parameter of the minimum height. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/autoExpand
[08:26:49] <systemfault> glen1: It's always easy but It's difficult for us to help without a real testcase...
[08:27:39] <muzone> Sup y'all
[08:28:14] <glen1> systemfault, want me to so my code
[08:28:35] <KeirLav> gurumelo: i'm trying to make a checkbox remove its disabled attr once i can confirm a textarea has been 'read'
[08:28:38] <systemfault> glen1: That would be nice, or write a small testcase on jsfiddle.net , as you wish
[08:28:41] <KeirLav> by read i mean scrolled to the bottom
[08:29:35] <muzone> In this simple dropdown menu - http://www.webdevout.net/test?0t&raw - is it possible to make jQuery adjust the width of the dropdowns according to the content? (i.e. to stretch 10px from the last letter of the longest anchor)
[08:32:47] <KeirLav> muzone: just remove the 150px fixed width of the of the ul and add a padding right of 10px?
[08:34:28] <KeirLav> muzone: and add white-space: nowrap; to the element too, no need to use jquery for that just css
[08:35:08] <KeirLav> muzone: basically add this to your css in place of your current ul --- #main_menu li:hover ul {     display: block;     padding-right: 10px;     white-space: nowrap; }
[08:35:50] <muzone> KeirLav: simple as that??
[08:35:50] <muzone> what the fuck man
[08:36:03] <KeirLav> muzone: try it, i've just edited your page using firebug and it works fine for me
[08:36:20] <glen1> systemfault, http://jsfiddle.net/tbBd4/1/
[08:36:32] <ravenzz> BlaDe are you there?
[08:36:50] <glen1> when you click on one of the html elements, it adds the class to all of them
[08:36:55] <KeirLav> if the default is too small add min-width: *value* to make sure it doesnt start too small
[08:37:05] <muzone> KeirLav: thanks a lot dude:)
[08:37:15] <toxz> is it possible to check if an element is not inside of another? i.e.   $('tr   not in table.special')
[08:37:37] <KeirLav> muzone: your welcome :)
[08:37:47] <systemfault> glen1: http://jsfiddle.net/tbBd4/2/
[08:38:18] <glen1> systemfault, you beautiful man lol
[08:38:30] <systemfault> :/
[08:38:31] <KeirLav> can anyone help me figure out how to enable a checkbox once ive confirmed that a textarea has been scrolled to its bottom?
[08:38:33] <glen1> whats the docs for e.target?
[08:38:40] <glen1> thanks, this was doing my head in
[08:38:47] <systemfault> glen1: The DOM I guess
[08:39:13] <BlaDe> ravenzz yes
[08:39:29] <ravenzz> BlaDe http://jsfiddle.net/VHwb9/2/ .. if your LI elements have different height, you should fix the top position calculation
[08:40:27] <BlaDe> ravenzz that looks great
[08:40:50] <Vorspire> Oo
[08:40:51] <Vorspire> oO
[08:41:06] <KeirLav> can anyone help me figure out how to enable a checkbox once ive confirmed that a textarea has been scrolled to its bottom?--- anyoneeeee
[08:41:36] <Vorspire> KeirLav, you doing some sort of agreement page I guess? :)
[08:42:12] <KeirLav> Vorspire: lol exactly, just cant seem to find the event of the scrollbar on the textarea being used
[08:42:35] <KeirLav> Vorspire: never mind actually finding out if the scrollbar is at its bottom
[08:42:36] <BlaDe> ravenzz i'll try it
[08:43:02] <Vorspire> hmm there are 3 functions to do with scrolling, KeirLav
[08:43:18] <ravenzz> $('textarea').scroll(function() { })
[08:43:18] <ravenzz> ?
[08:43:38] <BlaDe> ravenzz im not sure if that solution will work for me
[08:43:47] <ravenzz> why?
[08:43:48] <KeirLav> ravenzz: tried that, even $('textarea').scroll(function(){ alert('hello'); }); does nothing
[08:44:08] <ravenzz> KeirLav hold on, let me try
[08:44:41] <Vorspire> KeirLav, it looks like you'll need to compare scrollTop() to height()
[08:44:52] <Vorspire> if they are equal, it's at the bottom
[08:45:00] <Vorspire> that's what I gather from the JQ docs anyway
[08:45:17] <KeirLav> i found a solution on stackoverflow that seems logical, i just can't even hear the scrolling event at the moment
[08:45:22] <KeirLav> i've tried using scroll() and change()
[08:45:49] <Vorspire> strange
[08:46:06] <Vorspire> are your elements created AFTER the DOM has loaded?
[08:46:13] <Vorspire> in which case, try .live
[08:46:17] <KeirLav> yeah everything is within dom ready
[08:48:05] <bjensen> I have a text_field that is loaded into the DOM using ajax..how can I use for example tokeninput since it requires to be put in a document.ready() {} ? It obviously wont work since the field doesnt exist when the DOM is loaded..
[08:48:16] <bjensen> initialization is $("#my-text-input").tokenInput("/url/to/your/script/");
[08:51:38] <Vorspire> KeirLav, I'm gonna try to whip something up in JSFiddle, because I need to do this myself :D
[08:51:50] <Vorspire> I'll let you know if there are any problems
[08:51:55] <Vorspire> or if I find a good way
[08:52:35] <KeirLav> Vorspire : thanks :)
[08:52:55] <KeirLav> just being able to hear the scroll of the textarea would be great
[08:53:00] <KeirLav> don't understand why i can't
[08:53:16] <ravenzz> KeirLav http://jsfiddle.net/MV7LV/
[08:54:08] <ravenzz> but i trying to figure out why the scrollHeight is "taller"
[08:54:45] <KeirLav> i don't get an alert from this :S
[08:54:51] <Vorspire> I do
[08:57:01] <ravenzz> i see that the scrollHeight is > of the max scrollTop value
[08:57:42] <KeirLav> me having disabled="true" was preventing the .scroll() event from firing!
[08:59:30] <KeirLav> right now i am getting somewhere, should have been using readonly instead of disabled
[08:59:39] <KeirLav> thanks for your help with this guys
[09:09:42] <Vorspire> KeirLav, you can mess with this, it workswith DIV so it should work with anything: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/2vxth/
[09:12:46] <Camer0n> is there any way to get the contents of a page while keeping the session of a logged in user on another site?
[09:13:08] <Camer0n> so it opens it and saves it in a database
[09:15:31] <KeirLav> Vorspire: Brilliant!
[09:15:38] <KeirLav> thanks very much that works perfectly :d
[09:17:27] <Vorspire> KeirLav, welcome :)
[09:20:39] <BlaDe> my element is 100px wide - how can I figure out where the mouse is during the hover between 0 and 100 horizontally ?
[09:21:13] <Me-Selfe> wild guess is that its at 42 :p
[09:21:52] <helpmeplease> hello all, i would really like some help please if anyone can spare 2 mins?
[09:21:52] <BlaDe> lol Me-Selfe
[09:22:49] <Me-Selfe> BlaDe: check mousemove()
[09:24:14] <Me-Selfe> helpmeplease: ask the question alraedy
[09:24:40] <helpmeplease> will do :)
[09:24:40] <helpmeplease> 1 sec
[09:24:51] <helpmeplease> just fixing a thing to make it less confusing first.
[09:25:16] <helpmeplease> ok, so:
[09:26:39] <helpmeplease> i have a portfolio site. the site loads project names etc from a simple database, loads the first few into carousels (visible on the same page), and then puts the others into a subgroup. The subgrup ones, instead of showing in the carousel on the main page, send the user to another page
[09:27:13] <helpmeplease> this other page is a template page which loads the projects bits that would otherwise go in the front-page carousel
[09:27:39] <helpmeplease> So: 6 projects on tap, pre-loaded in  a carousel, the rest get their own sub-pages
[09:27:47] <helpmeplease> sound simple enough all that works
[09:27:59] <helpmeplease> with me so far?
[09:28:44] <tbranyen> helpmeplease: ... just keep going
[09:28:49] <helpmeplease> ok
[09:30:02] <helpmeplease> so that all works. INSIDE the main carousel (i'll send you a link to all this in a min), the "meat" of the projects is made up of 5 or so tumbnails, used to navigate a carousel of full-sized versions of the same images
[09:30:10] <helpmeplease> so, a simple thumbnail gallery.
[09:30:19] <helpmeplease> this ALSO works - on the MAIN page
[09:31:08] <helpmeplease> however, on the sub-pages - the ones which load as separate browser pages - these "project" carousels do not operate: the jquery classes are not even loaded
[09:31:10] <Engin> do you think inserting one very large img to the dom is expensive ?
[09:31:25] <Engin> I'm planning to insert 18 instances of it, it's like 2000x2000
[09:31:41] <tbranyen> Engin: yeah it can mess up some browsers
[09:31:43] <tbranyen> making them very slow
[09:31:50] <ferocia> Hey everyone
[09:31:54] <Engin> I'll support IE8/9, chrome, ff
[09:32:07] <tbranyen> Engin: yeah you might experience a lot of lag
[09:32:09] <helpmeplease> and so that is my question: why would you say the carousels work in their original context but not in the "secondary page" context?
[09:32:22] <tbranyen> helpmeplease: any number of reasons
[09:32:31] <helpmeplease> ok, well, some more info:
[09:32:32] <tbranyen> helpmeplease: you said you had a link
[09:32:37] <tbranyen> just show me that
[09:32:37] <helpmeplease> ok, yes
[09:32:56] <helpmeplease> how do i PM on IRC these days pls?
[09:33:03] <Bittarman> ask first
[09:33:03] <tbranyen>  /msg nick msg
[09:33:05] <ferocia> Does anyone know if it's possible to use jquery to force mouse scrolling to be in intervals? I have a site with horizontal scrolling and would like mouse scrolling to make the screen "swipe" sideways to the next anchor?
[09:33:25] <safzouf> Hi there
[09:33:52] <safzouf> how to debug returned list of the  query with firebug & DOM ?
[09:34:28] <Me-Selfe> safzouf: list of what query?
[09:34:42] <safzouf> any jquery query
[09:34:46] <safzouf> $
[09:35:15] <safzouf> how to see the list of elements that matches the query $
[09:35:55] <Jayflux> safzouf firebug should show you when you do it in the console
[09:36:01] <Me-Selfe> well, you can do something like: $('query').each ( function () { console.log ( $(this).attr('id') ) }.. Probably smarter ways
[09:36:01] <Jayflux> or dev tools
[09:36:35] <safzouf> okay I see
[09:36:52] <tbranyen> helpmeplease: it really helps to use a debugger to find these common issues
[09:36:56] <tbranyen> what browser do you use
[09:37:08] <helpmeplease> FF and Chrome
[09:37:18] <tbranyen> helpmeplease: well both have error consoles built in
[09:37:26] <tbranyen> in your sub page its failing to load jquery.countdown.pack.js
[09:37:34] <tbranyen> because of the subpage
[09:37:45] <helpmeplease> but
[09:37:50] <helpmeplease> countodwn isnt actually used
[09:38:02] <tbranyen> then why is it there
[09:38:05] <helpmeplease> that's just a leftover from another of my pages i cannibalised
[09:38:10] <tbranyen> then delete it?
[09:38:25] <helpmeplease> i can but it shouldnt fix the issue
[09:38:41] <tbranyen> also i'm not seeing anything broken on the subpage
[09:38:42] <tbranyen> i see images
[09:38:46] <helpmeplease> mm
[09:39:01] <helpmeplease> the problekm is that the jcarousel classes arent loading on the subpage
[09:39:04] <tbranyen> $('#countdown').countdown({until:$.countdown.UTCDate(-0, 2011,  7 - 1, 25), format: 'DHMS', layout:
[09:39:07] <tbranyen> onLoad.js:23Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'UTCDate' of undefined
[09:39:08] <tbranyen> um
[09:39:12] <tbranyen> you are using that plugin
[09:39:34] <tbranyen> and its erroring out
[09:39:39] <helpmeplease> but would that stop the carousels operating?
[09:39:44] <tbranyen> causing any subsequent scripts in that to not work
[09:39:52] <tbranyen> and check it out
[09:39:55] <tbranyen> carousel is next!
[09:40:15] <tbranyen> helpmeplease: this is also why people do NOT recommend using inline scripots
[09:40:20] <tbranyen> but placing them in separate files
[09:40:23] <tbranyen> to isolate errors like this
[09:40:29] <helpmeplease> ok, let me try that - i should explain ive only been building pages since March and have taught myself everything from scratch lol....so my programming is clumsy. gimme a sec.
[09:41:23] <tbranyen> learn to use the error console
[09:41:33] <ferocia> Does anyone know if it's possible to use jquery to force mouse scrolling to be in intervals? I have a site with horizontal scrolling and would like mouse scrolling to make the screen "swipe" sideways to the next anchor?
[09:41:34] <tbranyen> if you have any errors fix those firt
[09:41:37] <tbranyen> first*
[09:43:24] <helpmeplease> Tbranyen: you, sir, are a gentleman. thank you - that's fixed it. Honestly i had seen that it wasn't loading before but i'd disregarded it out of hand - didn't know that scripts were "queued" like that
[09:44:05] <djQuery> ferocia: there are several slide plugins that do that
[09:45:13] <ferocia> djQuery: really? I've been searching far and wide on google, but cant seem to find any that let me control the mouse scrolling like this? do you possibly have some names I could search for?
[09:45:18] <djQuery> ferocia: http://studio.html5rocks.com/#Deck

[10:25:20] <phpedinei> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz66rZ3Dy4w
[10:30:56] <Krinkle> Zerxer: You may wanna start by explaining why Uploadify isn't good enough (note /me has never used Uploadify)
[10:31:34] <Zerxer> because it uses Flash, and is very annoying to debug with. but just found ajax-upload, going to try that and hope it's still good
[10:33:01] <smykes24> im having issues with drag and drop and i was hoping someone could have a look
[10:33:24] <smykes24> http://jsfiddle.net/sycAc/
[10:35:47] <Zerxer> smykes24
[10:35:53] <smykes24> yessir
[10:35:54] <Zerxer> I will assume it's because of this: .slice(0,13)
[10:36:06] <Zerxer> it'd return answerSlotThr, and cut off the ee
[10:36:09] <Zerxer> breaking that slot
[10:36:17] <smykes24> oh shit
[10:36:18] <smykes24> im a moron
[10:36:25] <smykes24> i should start at the end
[10:36:31] <Zerxer> why are you slicing it
[10:36:32] <smykes24> how do you slice from the end i cant remember
[10:36:44] <smykes24> because there is a name in there
[10:36:48] <Kou> Hello,could som1 review this code if possible?Cookie problem.Seems i m not correctly setting em up.line 31-32.http://pastebin.com/xgQ8H9ENThanks in advance
[10:36:55] <Zerxer> use negative numbers for the start
[10:36:56] <rjb1> where can i get any good gantt or roadmap made with jquery?
[10:37:15] <Zerxer> to select from the end
[10:37:23] <smykes24> k
[10:37:26] <smykes24> let me try this
[10:38:47] <smykes24> i think i need to rethink it completely
[10:38:54] <smykes24> but i keep coming to this solution
[10:39:12] <Zerxer> smykes24: are you using HTML5? use data attributes, perhaps
[10:39:32] <smykes24> yeah this is a learning javascript project
[10:39:38] <Zerxer> data-corresponding-input="ID of input"
[10:39:40] <danieliser> any working methods to get ui.draggables id?
[10:39:57] <Zerxer> then you can do $(this).data('correspondingInput')
[10:40:05] <smykes24> (ui.draggable).attr("ID")
[10:40:26] <danieliser> smykes24:doesnt work.. also tried .id()
[10:40:38] <Zerxer> ui.draggable.id should work fine too, isn't ui.draggable already a DOM object
[10:41:06] <smykes24> i think i had issues with it now thatyou say it
[10:41:12] <smykes24> i used the class maybe
[10:41:16] <smykes24> i cant remember
[10:41:27] <Zerxer> console.log(ui.draggable)
[10:41:35] <Zerxer> look through what it has, figure out how to get what you want
[10:42:18] <smykes24> zerxer the issue is i cant use the number 1 variable
[10:42:20] <Zerxer> is it possible the draggable is actually a cloned version of the original element?
[10:42:21] <smykes24> its very confusing
[10:42:37] <danieliser> i did the console thing last night.. doesnt show the id .. its undefined
[10:42:44] <Zerxer> the number 1 variable?
[10:42:45] <jedimind_> Zerxer, very likely
[10:42:48] <danieliser> yes its cloned..
[10:43:08] <danieliser> doesnt carry id does it?
[10:43:10] <Zerxer> there should be some reference to the original element then
[10:43:14] <danieliser> didnt even think about that
[10:43:28] <danieliser> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/JAz5y/1/

[10:43:30] <Zerxer> check console.log(ui) and see what you can find
[10:43:30] <smykes24> if there are two ids that are the same i think it comes up undefinded
[10:43:40] <Zerxer> possibly
[10:44:02] <danieliser> Vorspire this is in a drop function of the draggable
[10:44:13] <danieliser> or the droppble rather
[10:44:47] <Vorspire> danieliser, if you're accessing a jQuery Object's native JS properties, either use .prop or $(this)[0].prop
[10:48:40] <danieliser> could the id be stored in global variable in the draggable start function and then read in the droppable stop function?
[10:49:11] <danieliser> ui.item.attr('id); works inside the draggable functions
[10:50:18] <Me-Selfe> what you guys figuring out?
[10:50:43] <hariom> I am trying to use deferred. Got success in using $.when but .then is not working. This is what I am doing: $.when($.get('test.html')).then(showTestMsg());
[10:51:08] <danieliser> using droppable drop function i need to access the id of the dragged element.. and ui.draggable doesnt seem to contain it
[10:51:41] <smykes24> danieliser:  didnt he say to use prop?
[10:51:46] <smykes24> rather than attr

[10:53:27] <hariom> Anybody to solve this deferred issue?
[10:53:28] <nail_> hariom: you need to pass a function, ie showTestMsg, not showTestMsg()
[10:54:25] <hariom> nail_: thanks. It has solved.
[10:54:57] <danieliser> smykes24: tried .prop('ID')  is that correct.. it returns undefined

[10:59:49] <danieliser> smykes24: in that script i need to get the id of the dragged element to modify the html when its dropped. i can add a class and modify the contents but i need to be able to detect what to change it to
[11:00:14] <Me-Selfe> danieliser: read the docs?
[11:01:11] <hariom> nail_: I tried sending 2 function like this:  .then(setBodyBoxHeight, showTables); I see that setBodyBoxHeight has executed but not showTable.
[11:01:30] <danieliser> Me-Selfe: yea.. and days of searching the net and irc.. http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/JAz5y/6/ ive tried dozens of methods.. ui.draggable doesnt seem to contain the id
[11:02:23] <nail_> hariom: the 2nd parameter to then() is to handle failures, you should .then(function() { setBoxyBoxHeught(); showTables(); }) instead
[11:03:33] <nail_> hariom: or .then([setBoxyHeight, showtables])
[11:05:23] <BlaDe> does noscript trigger <noscript> tags ?
[11:05:45] <Jayflux> should do when javascript is disabled yes
[11:06:20] <Me-Selfe> danieliser: save it as a custom attribute..
[11:07:07] <danieliser> Me-Selfe: would .data() work?
[11:07:43] <Me-Selfe> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/JAz5y/6/
[11:07:55] <danieliser> i can read the id i need during the sortable recieve function and assign it to a global but that function seems to execute after the drop function
[11:09:18] <danieliser> Me-Selfe: ??
[11:09:26] <Me-Selfe> danieliser: http://jsfiddle.net/PqaGy/
[11:09:30] <Me-Selfe> ah, so you dont need the id?
[11:17:10] <bjensen> anyone here use jquery-tokeninput? Im trying to get it to allow custom entries
[11:19:44] <danieliser> Me-Selfe: that method would satisfy my needs.. i just need to detect what they dropped so i can replace it with the proper html block.
[11:20:22] <danieliser> Me-Selfe: my guess is that the id is stripped before ui.draggable is populated

[12:03:09] <alystair> How do I animate background-position?
[12:03:10] <DofLeFou> Greetings
[12:03:27] <Kou> If i remove the comments nothing happens
[12:03:36] <DofLeFou> I m running into some issue trying to use .autocomplete ... on some of my textbox
[12:03:51] <DofLeFou> what script do I need to add
[12:04:09] <DofLeFou> I m getting $("#ShowClientName").autocomplete is not a function
[12:04:39] <DofLeFou> where #ShowClientName is the id of my textbox
[12:12:05] <alystair> there's no way to animate background-position?
[12:14:20] <staar2> hello
[12:14:37] <staar2> does the .live support load event ?
[12:15:29] <smplstk> alystair: you can do it with a plugin: http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/backgroundPosition/
[12:15:58] <smplstk> alystair: this is some hotness right here: http://snook.ca/technical/jquery-bg/
[12:17:06] <alystair> smplstk: you mean from 2008 ;)
[12:17:44] <alystair> he uses a background-position plugin, you'd think something like that would be built-in already
[12:18:20] <smplstk> the need to animate background-position is kinda isolated.
[12:18:26] <smplstk> I don't think it'll ever end up in core.
[12:18:51] <djQuery> ?backgroundposition
[12:18:55] <bot-t> djQuery, #7681 (backgroundPosition animate in IE)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 7 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7681
[12:19:16] <djQuery> left out the . see ?.backgroundposition
[12:19:17] <bot-t> djQuery, #7681 (backgroundPosition animate in IE)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 7 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7681
[12:20:30] <smplstk> so, it looks like you can animate background-position-x and background-position-y
[12:20:45] <smplstk> seperately.
[12:21:32] <alystair> unusual
[12:21:47] <smplstk> it doesn't seem like those properties work everywhere either.
[12:21:49] <alystair> I tried looking into that but it doesn't seem background-position-x/y is valid in css?
[12:21:55] <alystair> yeah I'll just use a hook :S
[12:24:28] <BlaDe> I have say.... <ul> <li> <ul> <li/> <li/> <li/> <ul> <li/> <li> </ul> <li/> </ul> </li> </ul> to create a tree view
[12:24:35] <BlaDe> can I do some sort of smart ul.each() to create a collapse/expand button ?
[12:30:05] <Vorspire> BlaDe, a Tree menu like this? http://www.tyneside-traders.com
[12:31:04] <BlaDe> Vorspire a little but it can have many nodes
[12:31:06] <damilare> hello, I am reading jquery's source core.js line by line, so as to understand the core itself
[12:31:20] <BlaDe> i.e. <ul>  <li> list one <ul> <li> list two </li> </ul> </ul>
[12:31:23] <damilare> and I am lost on line 130
[12:31:29] <Vorspire> BlaDe, that menu system can have unlimited nodes
[12:31:48] <damilare> what does jQuery.fn.attr.call does ?
[12:31:59] <BlaDe> Vorspire i see
[12:32:07] <Vorspire> http://www.tyneside-traders.com/Framework/JavaScript/node_menu.vn.js
[12:32:26] <bot-t> damilare, call - MDN Docs - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[12:32:46] <fusionality> hi
[12:32:48] <systemfault> damilare: I can't see the source but usually, it's used to call a function with a context
[12:33:20] <damilare> systemfault, thanks the source is here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js
[12:33:45] <damilare> what is a context in your context :)
[12:34:22] <systemfault> damilare: "selector" is the context, the rest are arguments passed to the function
[12:34:26] <damilare> cos I understand jquery context is a selector's parent dom
[12:34:42] <damilare> I see
[12:34:43] <systemfault> damilare: The context means in that case, the value of "this" within the function
[12:34:53] <fusionality> i have a weird issue with getScript()
[12:34:54] <damilare> oh cool
[12:35:01] <fusionality> http://pastebin.com/5WCNFWee
[12:35:15] <fusionality> ^^this is inside my documet.ready
[12:36:24] <fusionality> 3 scripts get loaded, the 4th, the facebook script not. URL is correct but i can't see the request in firebug, but i see the "loaded" in console
[12:36:41] <systemfault> damilare: Sorry if the fact that the line had a variable called context to mess up my explaination :/ I didn't know.
[12:37:05] <BlaDe> Vorspire that doesnt work as default - i guess the markup is incompatible?
[12:38:01] <Vorspire> BlaDe, you would have to modify the markup to suit the menu, but you can simply feed the menu an array of the menu structure and the markup will be generated automatically
[12:38:13] <damilare> systemfault: context in that line is the parent dom of the selector, which in most cases is document, but I also get your explanation, thanks!
[12:38:31] <BlaDe> Vorspire i see, what kind of array?
[12:38:35] <BlaDe> i mean, the format
[12:39:04] <BlaDe> you know, I better not use that actually.
[12:39:05] <fusionality> how to see what's going on behind the scenes?
[12:39:45] <Vorspire> I usually use a PHP class to generate this menu, so yea, but you can see the code and see how it works, etc
[12:39:57] <BlaDe> Vorspire: http://i.imgur.com/YUb1u.png
[12:40:06] <BlaDe> that's the menu at the moment
[12:40:20] <BlaDe> I want to make the parents collapsible was hoping for a simple jquery solution but i can't figure one out
[12:40:31] <BlaDe> $('.directories li:has(ul) a').each(function() { }); selects most of what I want but not everything
[12:42:43] <Vorspire> BlaDe I don't know without seeing a demo or the actual code, but it may take slightly more complex markup than just ul and li, I wrapped each ul element in a div to symbolise directory level for instance
[12:43:05] <fusionality> http://imgur.com/yi1N4
[12:43:12] <fusionality> ^^firebug
[12:43:54] <BlaDe> Vorspire it's a recursive function in php
[12:46:38] <rjb1> any roadmap development made with jquery please
[12:48:14] <Vorspire> rjb1; http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/keWpE/
[12:49:38] <rjb1> Vospire: what is that? an oldie video?
[12:50:26] <BlaDe> lol
[12:51:52] <MoTiOnXml> when the browser slows down over time when debugging + lots of javascript, is this typically a sign of memory leaks?
[12:52:23] <MoTiOnXml> i feel the stuff i'm building runs a lot faster, if i close the browser every couple of hours and start over
[12:52:24] <rjb1> wtf lol
[12:52:37] <abjorn> lol man, I get a customer in a chat at work today wanting to know why their site was loading so slow. I check the server to see if it has high load - nada. I ping the domain to see if it's slow, nope. So then I load it up in YSlow and what do I find? 17 external JS scripts and 21 external images lololol
[12:53:25] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: this is all local development
[12:53:37] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: if you're referring to me; didn't used to see this kind of behaviour
[12:54:11] <abjorn> Oh I didn't even read what you said, I was just saying.
[12:54:15] <abjorn> Now I seem rude.
[12:54:23] <BlaDe> did you see the code Vorspire?
[12:54:33] <fusionality> no idea what's wrong with my getScript() ?
[12:55:01] <nyuszika7h> y.
[12:55:03] <nyuszika7h> Oops
[12:55:06] <BlaDe> abjorn ouch lol
[12:55:07] <abjorn> But it could be a memory leak, MoTiOnXml. Or your JS could be structured in a way that it will slow down over time. Either one.
[12:55:09] <BlaDe> abjorn what on earth for ?
[12:55:14] <abjorn> lol idk
[12:55:24] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: no, not rude at all - i'm all in for optimization etc. but am just asking whether mem leaks is "normal" when doing a lot of ajax etc.
[12:55:41] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: i'm doing a lot of overlays / iframes
[12:55:42] <BlaDe> MoTiOnXml I think the point he was making is that the first block of text wasn't aimed at you
[12:55:54] <MoTiOnXml> BlaDe: yea, i'm not offended :)
[12:55:56] <abjorn> BlaDe: Well, he developed the site on another test server. I think what happened was that all the resource links were absolute rather than relative, so it loaded them from the test server on the live server.
[12:56:11] <BlaDe> abjorn ah I see - rookie error hehe
[12:56:19] <Segaja> hi
[12:56:20] <abjorn> Yeah lol
[12:56:30] <MoTiOnXml> lol :)
[12:56:38] <abjorn> I give the guy credit, though, he was the first customer I'd had that actually had a good web design.
[12:56:52] <abjorn> Everyone else was like looking at geocities
[12:56:52] <MoTiOnXml> is there any particular tips for unloading objects in the dom with jQuery?
[12:56:57] <BlaDe> lol
[12:56:58] <MoTiOnXml> i'm using remove etc. to clean up
[12:57:07] <BlaDe> MoTiOnXml the garbage collector should do that for you
[12:57:14] <Segaja> if i have a link on a page and use onclick="javascript:return false;" a click on the link doesn't do anything. is there a way to do the same with a jquery .click() call? if i simply return false from the callback of the .click() it doesn't work
[12:57:32] <MoTiOnXml> BlaDe: don't know what it is then
[12:57:41] <BlaDe> Segaja $().click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[12:58:09] <Segaja> BlaDe: thanks
[12:58:15] <BlaDe> np
[12:59:00] <Segaja> so with this i can use a jqueryUI modal confirm dialog and if someone hits the cancel button i do this and in the other case i do nothing and the normal link is executed, right?
[13:01:13] <Segaja> BlaDe: ?
[13:02:13] <Engin> .foo selects 8 elements... .foo>.bar selects 0. but there sure is a .bar child of each .foo, i can verify from the inspector of the browser. any pitfalls ?
[13:02:37] <BlaDe> Segaja yes
[13:02:44] <Segaja> thanks
[13:02:55] <Segaja> that is an implementation i can live with and which also works without JS
[13:03:15] <Engin> it is like div.foo.x>div.bar
[13:05:39] <Teltariat> Hello: what is the opposite of JQuery's parseJSON?  ie, takes a map and creates a string with well-formed JSON?
[13:07:01] <snover> Teltariat: json2.js.
[13:07:45] <Teltariat> snover: I'm pretty surprised that that functionality isn't part of core JSON...
[13:07:55] <Teltariat> snover: ...I mean core JQuery
[13:08:05] <juha___> http://userpics.com/13830.jpg
[13:08:22] <systemfault> Teltariat: Pretty much all browsers support it natively... json2.js is for older browsers.
[13:08:46] <aaronmcadam> doc.createDocumentFragment is not a function
[13:08:47] <snover> Iâm not so sure why this is at all surprising; jQuery serializes to query string
[13:08:51] <Segaja> json2 is written by crockford, right?
[13:08:59] <systemfault> Segaja: Yes
[13:09:03] <Segaja> ok
[13:09:30] <Engin> should expect all the DOM to be parsed right after I do $(big_html_chunk).appendTo(p) ?
[13:12:03] <Engin> am I getting something wrong here
[13:12:09] <Segaja> appendTo()? is it not simply append()?
[13:12:30] <Segaja> ah my bad
[13:12:30] <Engin> x.children('.foo').length is 8 but x.children('.foo>*').length is 0
[13:12:34] <systemfault> Segaja: appendTo is the opposite.
[13:12:45] <Segaja> systemfault: according to the doc they do the same
[13:12:48] <Segaja> but i'm reading
[13:13:20] <Segaja> systemfault: ok, you are right. sorry
[13:13:57] <smplstk> They do the same thing, but in different ways...
[13:14:08] <Segaja> yeah, i just realized
[13:15:38] <smplstk> $('<my_html_element>').appendTo('body') vs $('body').append('<my_html_element>');
[13:16:23] <Engin> jeez I'm blinded I can't see what the fuck is wrong
[13:16:26] <Segaja> i always use .append() that is why i didn't knew about .appendTo()
[13:16:32] <Engin> .find('.bar') returns 16
[13:16:37] <Segaja> so?
[13:16:38] <Lampoon> so are you
[13:16:50] <Engin> .children('.foo') returns 8
[13:16:59] <Segaja> normal
[13:17:07] <Engin> there's .foo>.bar and .another>.bar
[13:17:11] <Engin> each  8, which makes 16
[13:17:13] <smplstk> so?
[13:17:13] <Segaja> if your element has some .foo elements which are not on the first level
[13:17:14] <Lampoon> so are you
[13:17:21] <Engin> but .children('.foo>.bar').length is 0
[13:17:22] <smplstk> so? so?
[13:17:23] <Engin> not 8
[13:17:52] <Segaja> .children() only looks at the direct children of the element
[13:18:01] <ajpiano> Engin: children only filters children, it doesn't flter advanced things that by definition select children of the children
[13:18:16] <systemfault> Ah
[13:18:23] <Engin> aargh
[13:18:44] <systemfault> ajpiano: It's like filtering by applying .is on every element?
[13:19:19] <ryrych> hi
[13:19:31] <Me-Selfe> hi!

[13:19:50] <rjb1> !search gantt
[13:20:13] <ajpiano> systemfault, is calls filter - filter doesn't call is :)

[13:20:26] <ryrych> jQuery can't read children().outerHeight() when one of the children is embedded flash; and what is strange it works in jsFiddle not locally: http://jsfiddle.net/nkx54/
[13:20:46] <ryrych> Chrome does the trick but Firefox doesn't
[13:20:48] <systemfault> ajpiano: Ah ok :)
[13:20:56] <ajpiano> .children("foo") is like calling children().filter("foo")
[13:23:03] <ryrych> oh yeah, I could reproduce it on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/nkx54/1/
[13:23:46] <ryrych> anyone? :)
[13:25:16] <dnyy> how can I keep a scrollbar at the bottom of a div? Doing $('#foo').attr({ scrollTop: $('#foo').attr('scrollHeight') }) doesn't seem to work anymore. :/
[13:26:16] <ryrych> dnyy: use .scrollTop, not attr
[13:26:59] <dnyy> ryrych: still a no go. :/
[13:27:19] <ryrych> dnyy: I meant better code :)
[13:27:37] <ryrych> dnyy: read the height of the div
[13:28:57] <ryrych> dnyy: I don't remember but you may need to * -1 it
[13:29:10] <dnyy> actually seems like scrollHeight is what's not working anymore
[13:29:11] <nielsb> is there someone here that can help me with an animation problem?
[13:30:19] <ryrych> dnyy: scroll top does the job when some part of the div is hidden, e.g there is overflow applied
[13:30:35] <dnyy> ryrych: well there's overflow-x: hidden, overflow-y is scroll
[13:30:43] <alystair> augh this plugin isn't working at all >:(
[13:31:08] <nielsb> my animation works fine with the first 'slide', then it bugs. Anyone got any ideas?
[13:31:33] <cook1es> what is the CSS selector to select a div that contains "$(document).re"
[13:31:46] <smplstk> ?p @ nielsb
[13:31:46] <bot-t> nielsb, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:31:54] <ryrych> dnyy: did you try setting .scrollTop(xxx) by hand?
[13:32:12] <dnyy> ryrych: yeah, and that works. the only thing not working is scrollHeight, it returns undefined for some reason.
[13:33:10] <ryrych> dnyy: but there's no .scrollHeight in jQuery, do you mean native JavaScript?
[13:33:22] <ryrych> maybe it is browser specifi
[13:33:23] <ryrych> c
[13:33:35] <dnyy> ryrych: well, in another project using an older jquery (and same browser), it worked fine
[13:34:43] <ryrych> dnyy: I suppose that scrollHeight returns the overall height of the div including hidden parts, right?
[13:34:56] <ryrych> so I would go for .height()
[13:35:11] <dnyy> height only returns height of what's visible, though
[13:35:45] <nielsb> smplstk: thanks for the link :) http://jsfiddle.net/rng5u/ Here it is in jsfiddle, but it doesn't seem to animate like it does on my webserver :s
[13:37:32] <dnyy> ryrych: oh, well. it's prop('scrollHeight') now, not attr
[13:38:51] <ryrych> dnyy: http://jsfiddle.net/wqJLb/
[13:39:14] <dnyy> ryrych: what about it?
[13:39:31] <ryrych> dnyy: you can read the children()
[13:39:40] <ryrych> and get the overall height
[13:39:47] <dnyy> ryrych: this works: $('#chat').scrollTop($('#chat').prop('scrollHeight'))
[13:39:48] <BlaDe> can anyone take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/wzkAG/
[13:39:55] <BlaDe> i'm trying to make each node collapsible
[13:40:50] <BlaDe> http://jsfiddle.net/wzkAG/1/ is better
[13:41:49] <ryrych> dnyy: what about older browsers?
[13:42:00] <dnyy> ryrych: no idea, not too worried about them
[13:42:06] <dnyy> just personal project i'm playing with
[13:42:12] <ryrych> that's ok
[13:42:46] <ryrych> can you guys take a look at my jsfiddle?
[13:44:13] <systemfault> ryrych: And what is the problem?
[13:44:29] <ryrych> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/nkx54/1/
[13:44:33] <nielsb> smplstk: you there? :)
[13:44:40] <ryrych> jQuery can't read the height
[13:45:05] <ryrych> $content.children().outerHeight() in Fx
[13:45:21] <smplstk> nielsb: looking now.
[13:45:32] <nielsb> smplstk: great :)
[13:45:43] <smplstk> 'Uncaught ReferenceError: rotate is not defined'
[13:45:48] <smplstk> in console
[13:47:18] <nielsb> smplstk: there is a function rotate at the end of the script right?
[13:47:52] <smplstk> yah, I see it, and it looks like it's in scope, so something weird is happening
[13:48:56] <sean`> any of you fooled around with increasing the height of a ui-slider handler on a vertical scrollerbar?
[13:49:14] <sean`> doesn't seem to work out for me
[13:49:47] <nielsb> smplstk: hmm :s does it mean some { } is positioned wrong?
[13:52:18] <BlaDe> any tips for this? http://jsfiddle.net/LZrt9/
[13:52:22] <BlaDe> it's selecting the wrong elements
[13:53:31] <sean`> fuck this
[14:02:10] <mavv> hi! how to get same effect in $.ajax from $().load("page #content"). i mean get only part of page
[14:13:33] <muzone> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/how-to-create-a-slick-tabbed-content-area/
[14:13:39] <muzone> Is this how you guys would do it too?
[14:16:44] <Vorspire> (muzone): nope, that isn't smooth enough imo
[14:18:23] <BlaDe> any tips for this? http://jsfiddle.net/LZrt9/ -- it's selecting the wrong elements
[14:20:08] <muzone> Vorspire: awesome - what would you do then?
[14:20:43] <sean`> sup Vorspire
[14:20:51] <muzone> aweful lot of complicated js in there too, was hoping there'd be a simpler jquery solution
[14:20:59] <sean`> muzone, see ?tabs
[14:21:00] <bot-t> muzone, UI/API/1.8/Tabs - Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[14:21:01] <Vorspire> I wouldn't have it slide the elements up ontop of each other like that does, it makes it look a bit jerky, the style is nice though the animation lets it down
[14:21:14] <Vorspire> hey sean`
[14:21:17] <muzone> aaaaaaaaah sweet !!
[14:21:18] <sean`> also, note that tut is using 1.OLDSHIT
[14:21:42] <muzone> fuck
[14:21:46] <muzone> i wish i hadnt gone through with that tut
[14:21:49] <muzone> damn :D
[14:21:52] <Vorspire> lol
[14:22:16] <Vorspire> muzone, sorry, I assumed you knew about jQueryUI xD
[14:22:48] <sean`> muzone, time spent learning is never bad
[14:23:28] <sean`> and if it's a bad thing, you'll remember that for a looong time
[14:23:38] <muzone> Vorspire: well i do
[14:23:50] <muzone> or sorta in the process of discovering it:-)
[14:23:55] <Vorspire> nice :)
[14:24:03] <Vorspire> it's extremely powerful
[14:24:18] <muzone> oh indeed!
[14:24:27] <muzone> sean`: so true man !!
[14:25:32] <Segaja> hi, i want to make a modal confirm dialog and if the user hits the cancel button i want to call e.preventDefault() on the clicked event
[14:25:42] <Segaja> is there a way i can pass the event to the dialog?
[14:25:56] <Segaja> my idea would be to make the variable one level more global
[14:27:15] <BlaDe> any tips for this? http://jsfiddle.net/LZrt9/ -- it's selecting the wrong elements
[14:28:19] <dabear> ?reduce @ BlaDe
[14:28:20] <bot-t> BlaDe, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[14:29:42] <BlaDe> dabear huh..?
[14:29:48] <BlaDe> reducing that will make it more difficult to understand.
[14:30:15] <BlaDe> i just want to make the parent nodes expandable/collapsible.
[14:31:00] <Segaja> and the "-" is appended to the wrong one?
[14:31:04] <dabear> i am looking at some code without comments that supposedly does something incorrectly
[14:31:17] <dabear> I have no way to know what you want help with :/
[14:31:29] <BlaDe> dabear I said 3 times :-)
[14:31:30] <systemfault> BlaDe: You might want to check for e.target
[14:31:40] <BlaDe> Segaja yeah correct it's putting the "-" on the wrong elements
[14:31:42] <systemfault> this is perhaps not what you want.
[14:31:44] <BlaDe> systemfault why?
[14:31:50] <Segaja> of course it is
[14:31:50] <systemfault> Ok.. don't do it.
[14:31:54] <Kcharle> I need some help, im trying to use jquery so when i click a link a div appear with content, but when i click another one i want the first div to close so the next one can open
[14:32:09] <Segaja> li:has(ul) is getting the li's of the liniks
[14:32:12] <dabear> for starters, you have two selectors, which one breks?
[14:32:14] <Segaja> your selecter is wrong
[14:32:14] <dabear> breaks
[14:32:22] <BlaDe> i know the selector is wrong heh
[14:32:27] <Segaja> you need the previous of li:has(ul)
[14:32:45] <BlaDe> is there a :previous selecto?
[14:32:51] <Segaja> why not simply use the parent class to select?
[14:33:00] <Segaja> 'li.parent'
[14:33:05] <Segaja> 'li.parent a'
[14:33:06] <BlaDe> because the parent also has child folders
[14:33:09] <BlaDe> parent is the root
[14:33:26] <Segaja> i though you want the parents?
[14:33:51] <mavv> how to get same effect in $.ajax from $().load("page #content"). i mean get only part of page
[14:33:53] <mavv> ?
[14:33:57] <Kcharle> I need some help, im trying to use jquery so when i click a link a div appear with content, but when i click another one i want the first div to close so the next one can open
[14:34:26] <Segaja> Kcharle: hold the current open div in a var and cloth it before you open the next on each click
[14:34:32] <BlaDe> Segaja you're right, .parent is fine. oopsl.
[14:34:37] <bytesplit> hello!
[14:34:44] <dabear> mavv: just do $(theAjaxDataHere).find("page #content")
[14:34:55] <dabear> make sure no javascript is included into the ajax data
[14:35:00] <Kcharle> ok ill try and figure out how to do that, kinda new to jquery
[14:35:16] <Segaja> Kcharle: that is not a jquery thing. it is a js thing
[14:35:18] <imsky> innnnndependence
[14:35:18] <imsky> day
[14:35:26] <Kcharle> ahh
[14:35:35] <Segaja> remember in a var that is outside the click function the new div
[14:35:54] <sipher> How do I get a plain array of element nodes from a jquery set of them? Like $('input').length is 58 or something if I only have 3 inputs.
[14:36:01] <Segaja> on each click if the variable is not null use var.remove() to remove it from the dom
[14:36:10] <Segaja> than add the new div to the dom and place it in the var
[14:36:42] <Segaja> sipher: $('input').get(0).length
[14:36:54] <Segaja> that would be from the first matched jQuery element the DOM node
[14:37:12] <sipher> hum
[14:37:14] <sipher> k
[14:37:15] <BlaDe> Segaja what's the best way to collapse the children?
[14:37:21] <BlaDe>  $(this).parent().next('li').toggle(); <- doesn't do it
[14:37:38] <Segaja> $(this) is the parent link?
[14:37:48] <sipher> Segaja: That wouldn't be just the first input right?
[14:37:54] <Segaja> sipher: right
[14:38:07] <Segaja> sipher: i think you want $('input').size()
[14:38:11] <bytesplit> How can I join multiple text inputs?
[14:38:15] <Segaja> that gives you the amount of foudn input fields
[14:38:23] <BlaDe> Segaja $(this) is the anchor in the parent link
[14:38:23] <Segaja> bytesplit: define join
[14:38:35] <bytesplit> I have multiple text input fields
[14:38:40] <Segaja> BlaDe: hm, i would try the same
[14:38:46] <bytesplit> I need them in a list with comma
[14:38:58] <bytesplit> input1, input2, input3,...
[14:39:02] <BlaDe> Segaja: http://jsfiddle.net/LZrt9/3/
[14:39:15] <BlaDe> it's close, but not quite
[14:39:21] <bytesplit> I used api docs > val example
[14:39:23] <sipher> Segaja: I'm dealing with ranges of inputs separately so I need to loop over a single array from arbitrary start/end positions.
[14:39:25] <bytesplit> but get error
[14:39:26] <Segaja> bytesplit: var data = []; $('input').each(function() { data.put($(this).val()); }
[14:39:53] <Segaja> bytesplit: after that you can join the array with the js Array.join() function
[14:40:26] <bytesplit> @Segaja I will have a try on that
[14:41:22] <Segaja> BlaDe: you could try to .toggle() the ul under the .next('li');
[14:41:50] <Segaja> sipher: sorry i don't understand
[14:42:15] <BlaDe> nope, Segaja - that's a bit worse (feel free to take a look at the jsfiddle :-) )
[14:42:33] <sipher> Segaja: So.. I do something like x = $('input').get(0); and x[0].value is coming up as undefined
[14:42:58] <Vorspire> $(':input')[0]
[14:43:25] <sipher> oh... hmm
[14:43:30] <Vorspire> $(':input')[0].value
[14:43:48] <Vorspire> $(':input').eq(0).val();
[14:44:34] <Cs1800> can anybody help me? i got a problem with $.getJSON function
[14:45:02] <Segaja> BlaDe: hm..
[14:47:04] <DofLeFou> Anyone know the script to include to get .autocomplete to work
[14:47:18] <alystair> How do I send the current object being animated back into the animation complete callback
[14:47:26] <alystair> so I can create a loop?
[14:47:57] <sipher> Okay so I tried all combinations of $('input').size(), .get(0).length etc. Nothing is working properly. For example I'll say there's 10 inputs, I get them via $('input') and I need to get _the number of inputs_ and loop over an array of them. This just isn't working.
[14:48:19] <Cs1800> ><
[14:48:20] <sipher> size and .get(0).length don't appear to return the number of inputs correctly
[14:50:05] <sipher> If I was just dealing with DOM methods I would do x = document.getElementsByTagName('input'); for (i=0; i<x.length; i++) {}
[14:50:41] <ptahdunbar> is it possible to create an element with a reference to another element on the dom (without using class or id)?
[14:50:41] <sipher> I would use .each if I could but I can't
[14:51:24] <BlaDe> Segaja i'm close
[14:51:28] <bytesplit> Segaja, I cant get it to work
[14:51:38] <bytesplit> but it's to late for me to check it out further
[14:51:39] <BlaDe>  $(this).parent().next('li').parent().find('li:nth-child(2)').toggle(); ---- but the problem is that does every second li not just the one I want lol
[14:51:42] <bytesplit> nearly midnight
[14:51:45] <bytesplit> thanks anyway!
[14:51:55] <bytesplit> will try again tomorrow
[14:51:56] <BlaDe> Segaja http://jsfiddle.net/LZrt9/4/
[14:52:06] <alystair> how come $(this) doesn't work in callback function
[14:52:20] <alystair> do I need to pass it some way?
[14:52:37] <Segaja> BlaDe: hang on
[14:54:08] <Segaja> BlaDe: i think it is a jsfiddle bug
[14:54:13] <Segaja> it works for me in a normal browser
[14:54:23] <BlaDe> what did you use?
[14:54:26] <BlaDe> I mean, the toggle code
[14:54:27] <Segaja> BlaDe: $(this).parent().next().toggle();
[14:54:50] <BlaDe> for me that hides the parent too
[14:54:50] <Segaja> works in firefox and chromiuum
[14:55:01] <Segaja> in the fiddle or in a real browser
[14:55:02] <Segaja> ?
[14:55:12] <BlaDe> real browser
[14:55:17] <Segaja> hm not for me
[14:55:48] <BlaDe> http://jsfiddle.net/hM48q/
[14:55:56] <Segaja> http://pastie.org/private/gvn3zkyprt9wjoiear5ba
[14:55:58] <Segaja> that works for me
[14:55:58] <BlaDe> in my website in chrome I get the same result as in the jsfiddle
[14:56:06] <BlaDe> if you click the "a" does "a" disappear too?
[14:56:08] <Segaja> ah i use a newer jquery
[14:56:13] <L1> How can I live bind a plugin? For an event, I can do $('.foo').live('click', function....  How would I achieve the same for a plugin invocation? e.g. $('.foo').live(myPluginHere())
[14:56:30] <Segaja> BlaDe: in your fiddle yes
[14:56:45] <BlaDe> Segaja that happens for me, in the browser too :<
[14:56:50] <BlaDe> which version of jquery are you using?
[14:57:10] <sipher> inputs = $('#cbox input'); <-- inputs.length is 40 with only 4 on the page.
[14:57:15] <Segaja> BlaDe: http://segaja.de/stuff/test.html
[14:57:15] <savid> Hi, I'm using the jqueryui datepicker,  and I want to make it so that it works for elements that are dynamically added in the future.  How do I do that?
[14:57:23] <Segaja> sry, was the same. 1.6
[14:57:35] <BlaDe> it works on your site, hm
[14:57:47] <Segaja> sipher: .size()
[14:57:58] <L1> savid: haha, same question within a minute of each other :p
[14:58:05] <Segaja> BlaDe: compare the code
[14:58:10] <Segaja> maybe i changed something else
[14:58:12] <sipher> Segaja: size also failed for me.. and I took .length straight from jquery documentation.
[14:58:28] <Segaja> all i did was add the html stuff around it and moved the JS code to the bottom
[14:58:44] <Segaja> sipher: .size() should give you the number of matched elements
[14:58:53] <BlaDe> Segaja i copied/pasted your js into mine it's the same. Can you try overwriting your markup just in case?
[14:58:54] <sipher> Segaja: .size() also returns 40
[14:59:00] <BlaDe> your css is different I don' tknow if that makes a difference though..
[14:59:15] <Segaja> BlaDe: i copied the css from the fiddle
[14:59:21] <Segaja> sipher: than you found 40
[14:59:22] <L1> savid: looks like we are out of luck: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5065285/making-a-jquery-plugin-work-on-a-dynamically-added-element
[14:59:27] <Segaja> sipher: give an example
[15:00:09] <BlaDe> ah yeah
[15:00:18] <Segaja> found it BlaDe ?
[15:00:23] <BlaDe> nope
[15:00:31] <BlaDe> wanna take a look at my live demo?
[15:00:34] <sipher> Segaja: It looks like a bug with jqueryUI. I'm calling the function that gets the inputs when an effect completes. "explode". I think it replicates the inputs or something maybe
[15:00:49] <sipher> and never dletes em*
[15:00:52] <sipher> deletes*
[15:00:57] <sipher> I'll upload
[15:01:10] <Segaja> maybe. anyway if size() gives you 40 than it found 40 elements
[15:01:29] <savid> L1, hah, thanks.
[15:02:21] <Segaja> BlaDe: i don't know what you are doing differently
[15:02:36] <Segaja> have a look at the source of my test.html and you see the jquery version
[15:02:55] <BlaDe> i noticed you a live demo
[15:03:09] <sipher> Segaja: http://jsfiddle.net/eaxVx/ sloppy code is sloppy. But tab through to add inputs then hit enter
[15:03:24] <sipher> no buttons or anything. This is only for personal use
[15:04:02] <Segaja> BlaDe: apart from the fact that your labels are a bit off, it works fine
[15:04:25] <BlaDe> it hides the "a" for me when you toggle it.. it shouldn't
[15:04:26] <BlaDe> you don't have that?
[15:05:09] <Segaja> sipher: i don't see where you remove the added inputs
[15:05:20] <sipher> I don't.
[15:05:37] <sipher> I haven't gotten to that yet
[15:05:38] <Segaja> BlaDe: you have to "-" near the test and a parent
[15:05:58] <Segaja> BlaDe: the first ist for the test and the second for the a, also they are too low
[15:06:05] <Segaja> BlaDe: repair your css :)
[15:06:17] <BlaDe> oh.. !
[15:06:18] <sipher> I was going to do something with the input values and then remove them, but ran into this problem/bug while looping through
[15:07:11] <BlaDe> thankyou Segaja what a silly mistake
[15:07:25] <Segaja> BlaDe: yw
[15:07:53] <Segaja> BlaDe: but it still is buggy in jsfiddle for me. that is why i moved it to a normal html page because i knew the selection rules where right
[15:07:57] <Segaja> s/where/were/
[15:08:34] <Segaja> sipher: where is the js code for the tabbing?
[15:08:46] <sipher> focus handler
[15:09:04] <sipher> Called via .one(...)
[15:09:38] <Segaja> i see
[15:10:44] <Segaja> did you try without the effect?
[15:11:04] <sipher> Not yet. Only suspected that a few mins ago
[15:11:36] <Segaja> BlaDe: looks better :) but the current element has no "-" also it has children
[15:11:59] <BlaDe> Segaja true.. why is that?
[15:12:35] <sipher> Segaja: Commented out the effect and.. that's the problem.
[15:12:45] <sipher> That's a pretty nasty bug imo
[15:13:10] <Segaja> sipher: file a bug report on that :)
[15:13:17] <Segaja> BlaDe: hang on
[15:13:47] <Segaja> BlaDe: because you have <li class="selected"class="parent">
[15:13:55] <Segaja> i think you want: <li class="selected parent">
[15:14:17] <Segaja> the way i see it the browser is overwriting the selected class with the new class attribute
[15:17:02] <BlaDe> oops silly php mistake, thanks Segaja
[15:17:03] <BlaDe> again..
[15:17:26] <Segaja> np
[15:17:33] <Segaja> i know these kind of mistakes
[15:17:38] <Segaja> made them myself often enough
[15:22:16] <sipher> Segaja: Thanks for the help btw.*
[15:22:21] <Segaja> np
[15:22:27] <Segaja> maybe one of you can now help me for a change
[15:22:38] <Segaja> what is the opposite of event.prevetenDefault(); ?
[15:22:56] <sipher> You mean something that triggers a default?
[15:23:17] <Segaja> right
[15:24:08] <NET||abuse> hi folks, i have an init method that runs $(".datepicker" ).datepicker();   and i have no datepicker classes on the page, but i get Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'datepicker'
[15:24:38] <Segaja> NET||abuse: did you load the jquery UI script with datepicker?
[15:24:44] <Segaja> after the jquery code
[15:24:49] <glen1> i made my first jquery plugin, kinda useless if you know what your doing but why not lol
[15:24:49] <glen1> http://glensm.github.com/jquery-fontchanger/
[15:25:00] <sipher> Segaja: _maybe_ .trigger()? Or maybe that only does explicitly specified events.
[15:31:16] <NET||abuse> Segaja: yeh, the ui isn't loaded unless it's needed, but there's an init that searches for most commonly used elements, so can i use .each(function){ $(this).datepicker() } ); to stop the error? or is there a better approach?
[15:32:17] <Segaja> NET||abuse: normally the .datepicker() function is not available if either the selected element is no jquery element or if the jquery datepicker code was not loaded
[15:35:07] <NET||abuse> Segaja: yeh, in this case the ui library hasn't been loaded as this specific page doesn't use it, but the init functtion which runs across most of this module of the site still does a check for .datepicker classes to activate when they are needed as a general purpose init, so to avoid this error as there is not the datepicker() plugin loaded, what's teh best approach to activating widgets when
[15:35:07] <NET||abuse> they're neede.d
[15:36:33] <Segaja> to load them after the code was loaded. that sounds like it is a problem of your system
[15:37:43] <Segaja> sipher: i just found a solution i think
[15:37:56] <sipher> hmm?
[15:38:24] <Segaja> i save the href attribute of the link and use window.location = target
[15:38:29] <Segaja> to trigget the link
[15:38:37] <Segaja> not the best way but...
[15:39:22] <sipher> oh.. well if you know it's a link and you're working with an href you can do location.href = e.target.href;
[15:39:38] <Segaja> yes i know it is
[15:39:55] <Segaja> thanks
[15:40:03] <Segaja> that saves two lines in my code
[15:40:10] <sipher> Make your handler accept an arg "e" or "evt' or something
[15:40:18] <Segaja> it already does
[15:40:40] <sipher> ah. yup
[15:40:43] <Segaja> http://pastie.org/private/myqpx6dccmnxj6gwuwlubg
[15:41:00] <Segaja> wups the (j) in the first line should be a ()
[15:41:39] <Segaja> and it works like a charm
[15:54:25] <cirwin> If I remove() a DOM node which had delegate()d event handlers bound on it, are they also unbound?
[15:56:55] <khaan> hi everybody. I've come to the most lovely debug part of a site. And i have some jquery problems i'm apparently too stupid to solve. Can anyone help me please? :)
[15:59:33] <adv_> anyone knows how to make these examples support multiple item selection? like support for ctrl. http://devheart.org/examples/jquery-customizable-layout-using-drag-and-drop/1-getting-started-with-sortable-lists/index.html
[16:04:51] <adv_> anyone knows how to make these examples support multiple item selection? like support for ctrl. http://devheart.org/examples/jquery-customizable-layout-using-drag-and-drop/1-getting-started-with-sortable-lists/index.html
[16:28:43] <ryanneufeld> what does cache: false do to the request headers when using $.ajax?
[16:45:38] <chrislabeard> hi guys, I'm using $(this).find(h2) on a hover function but it seems like there is a little bit of a delay. Is this not the right way to do this. Basically its a div with an h2 in it and when you hover over the div the h2 shows up.
[17:00:07] <aaairc> do you guys use a specific jQuery Eclipse plugin? in the Eclipse Marketplace I saw jQeryWTP 1.2.0 and JSDT jQuery 1.0.2... but both seemed to only be installed a couple hundred times which didn't seem encouraging
[17:02:29] <DofLeFou> is there a better way to show/hide table tr than using .show() .hide() by id's
[17:32:55] <aaairc> does anyone know how to install the jQueryWTP plugin. a site that would give directions?
[17:33:02] <aaairc> plugin for Eclipse?
[18:21:09] <dgouldin> is there a way in jQuery to get all attribute names defined on an element?
[18:22:30] <dgouldin> what, nobody around on 4th of July? :P
[18:23:57] <rummik> dgouldin: It's a big channel, someone will see it eventually :P
[18:24:39] <dgouldin> rummik: yeah, just much quieter than normal. I'm in Kyoto, it's 10:24am 7/5 for me
[18:25:27] <rummik> Mm, yeah.  I'm actually not sure why I'm inside instead of looking for fireworks O.o
[18:25:48] <Brodingo> fireworks are banned in texas :(
[18:25:58] <Brodingo> austin area anyway
[18:26:22] <dgouldin> Brodingo: in Dallas you just have to go outside city limits and you can find them, but you're not allowed to use them inside city limits either
[18:27:00] <Brodingo> yeah well its dry as fuck anyway, anyone using them is an asshole
[18:27:11] <dgouldin> Brodingo: in Buenos Aires, people shoot fireworks from their building rooftops ... not on July 4, but you know ...
[18:27:34] <snover> fireworks bans are wonderful
[18:27:37] <snover> i think they should be everywhere
[18:33:31] <Boundless> hey guys, so massive jquery noob here: i want to respond to a change in a radio button group (when "yes" show fields, when "no" hide them) whats the simplest way of doing that?
[18:33:38] <Boundless> i'm currently going
[18:33:39] <Boundless> $("input[name=agencyCheck.setManuallyFl]:checked", '#formId').change(function(){
[18:33:40] <Boundless> alert($(this).val());
[18:33:40] <Boundless> });
[18:34:24] <Boundless> its not working, but I was thinking I should be listening for a change in the value of the relevent name
[18:34:42] <dgouldin> Boundless: why are you selecting only :checked?
[18:35:04] <Boundless> i had the impresson that would give me the selected radio button
[18:35:33] <dgouldin> sure, but you want to perform an action on change no matter what the value, yes?
[18:35:55] <Boundless> yep
[18:36:04] <Boundless> tho i  will need to grab the value to knwo which action to perform
[18:36:41] <dgouldin> so $(this).is(":checked") inside the handler will tell you
[18:37:03] <Boundless> ok
[18:37:19] <dgouldin> or if you're using 1.6.x, $(this).prop("checked")
[18:37:20] <Boundless> so will i have to iterate over the two radio buttons inside the event handler?
[18:37:34] <Boundless> to determine which is checked
[18:37:56] <Boundless> im assuming input[name=agencyCheck.setManuallyFl] will return a list?
[18:37:57] <dgouldin> sorry, I read too quickly, I see now, so you just want the value of that form field then I believe
[18:38:04] <Boundless> yeah
[18:38:23] <Boundless> how do I get that?
[18:38:24] <dgouldin> see what $(this).val() returns
[18:38:56] <Boundless> umm k one sec
[18:40:18] <Boundless> oh cool
[18:40:21] <Boundless> that worked
[18:40:35] <Boundless> its like magic :P
[18:41:06] <rummik> Or a sugar high
[18:41:15] <dgouldin> yes, but don't rely on it too much ... it hurts when you have to do something outside jQuery's magic bubble
[18:41:28] * dgouldin grumbles about his attributes problem
[18:41:29] <Boundless> hehe
[18:41:36] <Boundless> thanks for the help :)
[18:41:38] <dgouldin> np
[18:41:51] <Boundless> was half expecting a "RTFM" response
[18:42:31] <rummik> Speaking of which, I'm looking for a good way to edit selections in a text area, but am only finding one for some reason
[18:42:42] <rummik> And it's from 2006
[18:42:45] <rummik> http://plugins.jquery.com/files/jquery-fieldselection.js_0.txt
[18:43:14] <dgouldin> rummik: does it work?
[18:43:35] <rummik> Haven't tried it yet, but I already know it's not quite what I'm looking for
[18:44:06] <dgouldin> so scavenge what you need from it, make a shiny new plugin, and put it up on github :)
[18:44:24] <rummik> Mm
[18:44:37] <rummik> That's actually what I was planning on doing if nobody knew of anything xD
[18:45:14] <dgouldin> rummik: stackoverflow ftw? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/740765/how-to-replace-the-currently-selected-text-inside-an-html-textarea
[18:46:28] <rummik> Seems like I remember different browsers having strange things for that
[18:47:04] <dgouldin> yeah, I'm just googling around, there are different opinions of course: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/401593/javascript-textarea-selection
[18:47:34] <rummik> Yeah.
[18:49:02] <rummik> My search was mostly jQuery specific, as I was hoping for something like $('#editor').selection('[' + $('#editor').selection() + ']');
[19:02:24] <gnrlbzik> hey guys, have any one experienced with $.ajax, when i request file, each time my requst time double folds

[19:22:39] <Rashu> rummik oh xD
[19:22:56] <Rashu> I thought the "y" was continuing the conversation and asking me "why"
[19:22:57] <Rashu> oh well
[19:23:04] <Rashu> I guess I'll just keep searching
[19:25:44] <djQuery> "9:16:27 PM) Rashu: I'd need to make the animation it's own function"  I took that as a  querstion and answered y meaning correct.
[19:25:51] * djQuery gone to bed
[19:26:00] <Rashu> oh oh oh !
[19:26:03] <Rashu> got it. Thanks!!
[19:29:49] <dgouldin> trying this once more: is there a way in jQuery to get all attribute names defined on an element?
[19:30:57] <gnrlbzik> if you know all the attributes you need to define
[19:30:58] <gnrlbzik> sure
[19:31:09] <gnrlbzik> attr({attr:value,attr:value}
[19:31:36] <dgouldin> no, I mean, I have an element with unknown attributes, and I want the names of the attributes already defined on it
[19:34:02] <dgouldin> gnrlbzik: ^
[19:35:03] <gnrlbzik> oh
[19:37:45] <Rawse> Can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/SrPLn/ when i click the link it should open the div underneath and when you click another it should close the first, for some reason when you click it the div opens and makes the links animate out
[19:38:15] <gnrlbzik> dgouldin: var attrs = $("#id2")[0].attributes;
[19:38:27] <gnrlbzik> see if that works
[19:38:38] <dgouldin> gnrlbzik: that breaks for IE5-7 according to quirksmode: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html#attributes
[19:39:27] <gnrlbzik> have no idea then : / sorry
[19:39:36] <dgouldin> np, thanks for trying!
[19:41:20] <Rawse> is it because the .siblings().hide('slow")???
[20:00:31] <danieliser> i have some jquery ui tabs that are sortable.. each tab has a sortable ul. i want to be able to drag from one tabs ul to another tab..
[20:01:01] <danieliser> it works fine if i remove .find( ".ui-tabs-nav" ).sortable({ axis: "x" }) from my tabs
[20:01:05] <ohboy> what's the point of dragging them? that seems pretty weird
[20:04:20] <danieliser> tabs need to be reorderable.. and lists in each tab also need to be sortable
[20:05:31] <rummik> danieliser: Probably killing the event before it bubbles to the parent element?
[20:07:45] <danieliser> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/ZEv8S/1/
[20:08:25] <danieliser> removing .find( ".ui-tabs-nav" ).sortable({ axis: "x" }) will make the funtion work properly
[20:10:56] <danieliser> rummik: any ideas how i can fix it?
[20:41:40] <thinkfast> hey all, just wondering if anyone can tell me why $(window).innerHeight(); dosnt return anything when i cntrl+f5 - it does when i do a normal refresh
[20:41:47] <thinkfast> however if i put an alert in before it, it works
[20:42:01] <thinkfast> its like my code tries to use the innerHeight before its calculated
[20:47:37] <Zerxer> this is strange
[20:47:50] <Zerxer> my image upload is getting 500 errors from the server when using firefox 5
[20:47:54] <Zerxer> but firefox 4/chrome are fine
[20:48:00] <Zerxer> now how do I debug this..

[21:15:50] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[21:19:27] <portal`> hm - when linking to another page - all JS stops working on the linked page (assuming because of the link structure ie: www.site.com/#/page.php - is there any way to make that work?
[21:19:30] <rosco_y> Newbie trying to learn to write functions:  jsLint is complaining about a missing semicolon, can anyone help me fix it?  http://jsfiddle.net/raylitalo/QyZVD/
[21:19:33] <portal`> (jquery mobile)
[21:21:39] <wkmanire> portal`: That is a pretty common thing to do these days. Thats how backbone.js routes backbones through controllers.
[21:22:00] <wkmanire> portal`: If all javascript stopped working, odds are you have an exception being thrown early in the processing of the javascript being loaded into the page.
[21:22:09] <portal`> nothing in firebug
[21:22:12] <portal`> :\
[21:22:18] <wkmanire> what about in chrome?
[21:22:27] <wkmanire> rosco_y: What line is jsLint giving you?
[21:22:56] <portal`> nothing in chrome either
[21:22:57] <rosco_y> wkmanire: thank you, line 14
[21:23:02] <wkmanire> rosco_y: btw, that C# page directive isn't being processed.
[21:23:10] <wkmanire> rosco_y: in the HTML in that page you posted.
[21:23:48] <rosco_y> wkmanire: maybe, it's the template generated by MonoDevelop for ASP.NET MVC View...seems to work in general....
[21:24:02] <wkmanire> rosco_y: var text theGreeting is invalid.
[21:24:13] <rosco_y> How is that done?
[21:24:23] <wkmanire> Javascript dynamically sets the types for your variables based on what you assign to them.
[21:24:33] <wkmanire> var theGreeting = "some text"; will suffice.
[21:25:05] <rosco_y> so, "var text : greeting + ' ' + person; ?
[21:25:12] <wkmanire> no
[21:25:27] <wkmanire> var text = greeting + "person";
[21:25:39] <rosco_y> then display text?
[21:25:46] <rosco_y> I mean "text"
[21:25:58] <wkmanire> portal`: You unfortunately you'll need to start using console.log() functions to trace the problem.
[21:26:12] <rosco_y> the tutorial I'm  working off has a typo, I guess
[21:26:15] <wkmanire> Just put it on the very first line executed on your script and keep moving it farther along until you stop seeing it.
[21:26:26] <wkmanire> rosco_y: You need to take some time and study javascript basics.
[21:26:50] <wkmanire> rosco_y: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[21:26:53] <rosco_y> That's actually what I'm attempting :)  http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[21:26:54] <wkmanire> I would suggest you start here.
[21:26:58] <wkmanire> This book is free.
[21:27:07] <wkmanire> jquery is a library built using javascript.
[21:27:08] <rosco_y> Thank you very much!
[21:27:30] <wkmanire> Once you get the hang of javascript, you'll really appreciate jquery even more and you'll get more out of it.
[21:27:58] <rosco_y> Perfect, that's just what I need--thanks a million wkmanire!
[21:28:18] <wkmanire> You're welcome.
[21:33:52] <wkmanire> Sure is quiet.

[21:57:29] <aaairc> anyone??? how do you get codeassist to work in Eclipse?
[21:57:51] <wookiehangover> aaairc: have you tried aptana
[21:58:22] <wookiehangover> not that I in anyway endorse or condone the use of eclipse
[21:58:33] <wkmanire> wookiehangover: What do you endorse :D
[21:58:49] <wolfe> bloat <3
[21:59:08] <aaairc> yeah i tried installing aptana 3.0 plugin, and everything i read about online didn't correspond to the plugin. to get jquery code assist it said you needed to "Install Aptana Features"... but of course that isn't an option in my Help menu in eclipse
[21:59:36] <aaairc> should i install an old aptana plugin... like aptana 2.0
[21:59:42] <wkmanire> I haven't tried aptana
[21:59:43] <wkmanire> how is it?
[21:59:51] <wkmanire> I'm still hooked on emacs. :)
[22:00:06] <wookiehangover> wkmanire: I use / recommend vim
[22:00:14] <wookiehangover> but emacs is dope
[22:00:20] <aaairc> seems like a piece of shit so far at least when it comes to supporting jQuery Code Assist. no documentation and everything on the internet that talks about it, references functionality that use to exist in 2.0
[22:00:25] <wkmanire> Yeah, I was just gonna say, Vim is a good choice.
[22:01:12] <wkmanire> Its javascript, you don't need the IDE. The debuggers are in the browser. he he
[22:01:20] <wookiehangover> but why would you need jquery code assit anyway
[22:01:43] <wookiehangover> its a small enough api
[22:02:06] <misterm> aaairc: If you want a good editor with decent code completion, check out Komodo, there's a free version called Komodo Edit as well
[22:02:16] <wookiehangover> nothing like cocao or anything
[22:02:44] <aaairc> wookiehangover: maybe i don't. i'm just learning it, and in the tutorial i was watching the guy had code-assist... so i thought that it would make things easier.
[22:03:12] <aaairc> with Komodo do i need to do anything special to get it to do codeassist for jQuery? install a plugin or something?
[22:03:17] <wookiehangover> a tool is only useful when you learn how to use it
[22:03:42] <wkmanire> danieliser: What are you trying to do exactly?
[22:03:49] <aaairc> wookiehangover: not sure what your point is
[22:03:56] <misterm> aaairc: it comes with autocomplete plugins for some of the major libraries out of the box
[22:04:11] <misterm> aaairc: it will also try to autocomplete your own objects/functions
[22:04:24] <wkmanire> emacs can also does code completion.
[22:04:34] <wookiehangover> so does vim
[22:04:39] <wkmanire> tags works pretty well on javascript soruce
[22:04:39] <misterm> The nice thing about Komodo is it's built on xul-runner, so you can write macros and editor extensions in Javascript
[22:04:40] <wkmanire> source*
[22:04:45] <wkmanire> as long as you keep your stuff organized.
[22:04:53] <misterm> it uses the same extension system as Firefox
[22:05:00] <wkmanire> misterm: Well thats pretty sweet.
[22:05:04] <misterm> also comes with vi and emacs keybindings "-D
[22:05:04] <snover> aaairc: there is a jquery code completion package that you enable in settings.
[22:05:16] <aaairc> snover: for Kmodo?
[22:05:24] <misterm> You can use python to extend it as well
[22:05:39] <snover> aaairc: no, for the other text editor you didnât ask about, heh
[22:06:01] <danieliser> wkmanire: i need to be able to reorder the tabs.. each tab has a ul that is sortable.. i would like to be able to drag a li from the ul in one tab to another tab..
[22:06:34] <wkmanire> So you want to drag a tab from one tab widget and drop it in another?
[22:06:43] <danieliser> wkmanire: i can get both functions working.. tab sorting.. and moving items accross tabs but not at the same time
[22:07:30] <aaairc> snover: awesome. got it working with Komodo. took me literally the time I was just speaking with everyone here. Aptana i spent over an hour and couldn't figure it out.
[22:07:45] <danieliser> the example i linked will do both functions.. sortable tabs with "find( ".ui-tabs-nav" ).sortable({ axis: "x" })"  remove that and the cross tab dragging works
[22:08:53] <danieliser> i need to be able to do both essentially
[22:08:54] <wkmanire> danieliser: This may be unrelated, but in your HTML you have c;ass where I assum you want class.
[22:08:56] <wkmanire> IN your attributes.
[22:08:58] <wkmanire> in*
[22:09:08] <portal`> wkmanire, what should i be looking for in console.log()?
[22:09:16] <wkmanire> portal`: That it happens.
[22:09:33] <danieliser> yea i fixed that already in my local code.. the code i posted was from earlier today
[22:09:39] <portal`> i have console.log(document) aoutputting - everything seems the same
[22:09:50] <wkmanire> Basically when you want to trouble shoot "javascript not running", you start plugging in console.log() statements until you see where the code stops executing.
[22:10:02] <wkmanire> Its pretty strange for the page to stop processing javascript without throwing an exception.
[22:10:15] <wkmanire> No, the message should be console.log("We got this far");
[22:10:19] <portal`> yeah
[22:10:20] <portal`> that works
[22:10:34] <portal`> alerts work - pretty much any dom modifications dont
[22:10:44] <portal`> but
[22:10:50] <portal`> if i stop including jquery mobile.js it does
[22:10:54] <wkmanire> That could indicate that the DOM is not yet available when your alerts are going off.
[22:10:56] <portal`> so its something with jquery mobile stopping it
[22:12:45] <danieliser> any ideas?

[22:13:15] <wkmanire> danieliser: Sorry, I haven't tried to do that myself before.
[22:13:34] <wkmanire> danieliser: At the moment I'm just sort of filtering. Filtering beer as well as easy questions.
[22:13:35] <wkmanire> :D

[22:26:03] <amit_usual> what is the error in this json response {"tags": ["Python", "", "JavaScript", "Ruby", "Emacs Lisp"]} , i am making a json request for a page with this response but somehow it gives me a parse error ?
[22:28:09] <misterm> amit_usual: it looks valid to me, are you sure there isn't some weird whitespace char creeping in, or an error elsewhere?
[22:28:52] <amit_usual> misterm : i don't get it either i am making this using a python backend?
[22:29:14] <amit_usual> misterm : chances of error should be even less
[22:29:32] <misterm> well it seems something's going wrong somewhere
[22:30:13] <misterm> if you can paste-bin or jsfiddle your front=end code it might help
[22:31:44] <aaairc> Ok, so does anyone have a recommendation for jQuery Code-Assist in Eclipse (vs Komodo Edit). I'm already pretty committed to Eclipse because the rest of my webapp is being built ontop of the playframework for java.

[22:54:19] <anavel> anyone ?
[22:55:10] <sarazeroo> i.ve got a question...its posible to change the "revert position" of a draggable?
[22:57:53] <sarazeroo> i.ve got a question...its posible to change the "revert position" of a draggable?
[23:11:48] <figus> Hello!!! does someone know if there's a known bug between Firefox 5 and "mousedown" event for other mouse button than left button???
[23:12:37] <dgouldin> anavel: yes, should work as you described
[23:12:51] <snover> figus: Iâm sure someone knows!
[23:13:33] <sarazeroo> i.ve got a question...its posible to change the "revert position" of a draggable?
[23:13:59] <figus> I've been trying this: http://jsfiddle.net/figus/WS8Km/1/ it works in chrome... and firefox below 3 (I never tried with firefox 4, but in 5 is not working), has someone experienced this?? :S
[23:14:35] <figus> ups, it meant to say "and firefox below 4", not below 3 :P
[23:16:17] <snover> figus: works fine for me in firefox 5.
[23:16:38] <snover> figus: time to check your firefox content -> javascript -> advanced settings.
[23:16:46] <figus> O_O really???? can you "left" click and a 2 appears in the div???
[23:17:16] <figus> no wait, "right" click :P sorry, I always confuse left and right
[23:19:55] <figus> in firefox content -> javascript -> advanced I only have 3 options... (Move or Resize existing windows, Show or hide windows and Deactivate or replace context menus (which is what i'm trying to do and is already ticked :P))
[23:20:48] <snover> figital: yes.
[23:20:50] <snover> oops
[23:20:52] <snover> figus: ^
[23:22:59] <figus> so... does this jquery plugin works for you in FireFox 5??? http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/projects/js/jquery/contextMenu/demo/
[23:23:30] <snover> yes.
[23:24:10] <figus> :O so sad :( then it's my firefox....
[23:24:31] <figus> I'll try with an english firefox :P, Thanks for your help :D :D :D!!!!
[23:29:51] <anavel> dgouldin: nope, i can't using something like $('#div_1#p_1') doesn't work
[23:30:17] <dgouldin> anavel: um, why do you have more than 1 id on an element?
[23:30:41] <anavel> dgouldin: well, i want to access element structurally.
[23:30:52] <anavel> like div#div_1.p#p_1
[23:31:15] <dgouldin> anavel: if you can use it to target an element in css, you can use it to target one in jQuery
[23:31:48] <dgouldin> so if you're looking for the element id p_1 which has an ancestor element with id div_1, you want #div_1 #p_1, not #div_1#p_1
[23:32:00] <anavel> ah
[23:32:01] <dgouldin> div.foo.bar selects a div which has *both* classes foo and bar
[23:32:07] <anavel> lemme try.
[23:32:56] <anavel> it works ! thanks man :D
[23:33:32] <dgouldin> anavel: np, remember the rule of thumb ... if it's not selecting the element you want, chances are you need to work on your css, not your js ;)
[23:34:13] <anavel> dgouldin: so i assume you can do something like $('div#div_x select#id_sel_dom option:selected'), yes ?
[23:34:41] <dgouldin> anavel: yep that should work
[23:34:55] <anavel> alrighty, thanks :)
[23:34:58] <dgouldin> np
[23:52:49] <shkiper> hey guys. who knows why droppable plugin is work for the only one tag-element?
