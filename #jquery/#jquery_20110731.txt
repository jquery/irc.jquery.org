[01:16:24] <thun> If have a div #blah and I call .hide everything works fine... but what if I have 10 divs all named #blah... how do I hide them all ?
[01:16:48] <misterm> thun: define "named"

[01:17:09] <fabiobik> thats bad pratice
[01:17:12] <misterm> thun: id should be unique
[01:17:23] <misterm> thun: if you want to group a bunch of elements together, use a class
[01:17:24] <thun> all id's should always be unique? hmm ok didnt know that
[01:17:27] <fabiobik> use class
[01:17:30] <thun> ahh ok
[01:17:36] <misterm> thun: yes, that's the point of an id

[01:36:22] <GDmac> Hello Jquery
[01:38:48] <misterm> GDmac: hullo
[01:42:28] <GDmac> i have success with a ajax chain but was wondering if and how it might be eating memory
[01:45:24] <misterm> GDmac, chrome developer tools has some great tools for profiling your javascript's memory usage
[01:45:40] <misterm> GDmac: but yea, AJAX can cause memory leaks/problems
[01:45:46] <GDmac> am making a fiddle right now to explain
[02:07:56] <GDmac> Here's the fiddle to talk about the concept. Inside the ajax success method i'm calling the next ajax.
[02:07:59] <GDmac> http://jsfiddle.net/LTrNy/
[02:08:34] <GDmac> Allthough this works, My question is, for 300 items and this being recursive
[02:10:17] <GDmac> misterm is there a better way to do 100 to 200 ajax calls
[02:14:13] <GDmac> Anybody like to look at this ajax question?
[02:17:29] <GDmac> Anybody here?
[02:18:18] <TvL2386> hi guys, when I include a .js file in my page which defines a method I made 'function initialize() { ... }' how can I call that from a <script> tag in the html? I attach handlers and add classes in the initialize() function. When including html using ajax, I'd like to run initialize() from the included html
[02:19:27] <TvL2386> I am getting a 'initialize is not defined' in the console
[02:19:34] <GDmac> can you make an example on jsfiddle.net?
[02:20:10] <GDmac> does the function have to be defined before you call it?
[02:20:50] <m0dmd> anyone know of a plugin that will allow me to set a selector to only show in a set of containers if it is no longer visible due to the scrolling of the page. Sort of like a fixed element
[02:27:45] <aaairc> is is    += or =+ to append something to a string variable?
[02:27:52] <aaairc> is it
[02:28:04] <aaairc> += right?
[02:28:31] <TvL2386> += indeed
[02:29:49] <TvL2386> I have a function initialize() in my javascript.js file, I have a 'keyup' event handler on a form element. In the success callback I call initialize() which will give an error 'initialize not defined'
[02:32:11] <aaairc> thanks
[02:32:45] <m0dmd> any ideas
[02:35:12] <TvL2386> see pastie: http://pastie.org/2298051
[02:41:37] <gnarf> hrm, random question
[02:41:56] <gnarf> are there any strings with length that are falsy?
[02:53:10] <wenbert> hello
[02:53:18] <wenbert> what is the best way to select Card A? http://pastie.org/2298103
[03:06:44] <Paganini> select it? $("#card_name")?
[03:07:04] <aaairc> have you guys ever run into a situation where if you set a border on a div, the browser calculates the height of the div correctly... whereas if there is no border it thinks it has less height than it actually should?
[03:47:16] <aaairc> is anyone in here familiar with Google Maps API? I'm trying to figure out if there is a command to repaint the map. Basically I'm doing actions on my website that could readjust the width of the containing div for the map... and i need a way to tell the map that div got bigger
[04:29:29] <|RicharD|> hi to all
[04:29:42] <|RicharD|> i know the basic basic of javascript...i can use jquery ?
[04:29:58] <coldhead> yes |RicharD|, jQuery makes javascript easier
[04:30:21] <|RicharD|> oki where i can begin with jquery ?
[04:31:55] <misterm> |RicharD|: check out "jQuery fundamentals"
[04:33:01] <|RicharD|> this: http://jqfundamentals.com/ ?
[04:33:11] <misterm> |RicharD|: yup
[04:33:53] <|RicharD|> oki thanks a lot :)
[04:33:57] <|RicharD|> i hope that will be simple :)
[04:34:01] <misterm> |RicharD|: np
[04:35:01] <coldhead> you'll be fine, |RicharD|, and you can get lots of help here if you ask smart questions
[04:35:23] <|RicharD|> oki thanks...now i begin to study it :)
[04:41:51] <ShawnRisk> how do I make make these function only get the element within a class?  Also how do I normal normlFontSize function return all the fonts to their original font sizes?  Code: http://pastebin.com/2u6D9CtL
[04:48:41] <coldhead> ?filter @ ShawnRisk
[04:48:41] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[04:48:56] <coldhead> $('p,foo,blah,etc').filter('.someclass')
[04:49:15] <coldhead> that's for elements that have that class
[04:50:16] <coldhead> or you may want $('.someclass').find('p,foo,aids') etc
[04:50:46] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: you are talking about the .each line right?  Why can't I keep that there?
[04:50:51] <coldhead> you can
[04:51:09] <coldhead> $('p,foo,blah,etc').filter('.someclass').each(everything_else_is_the_same...
[04:51:17] <ShawnRisk> one sec let me try
[04:51:31] <coldhead> $('.someclass').find('p,foo,aids').each(...
[04:56:09] <ShawnRisk> let me try that one
[04:58:07] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: that works, but what about the function normalFontSize?
[04:58:54] <coldhead> that is not easy to do, the way your other functions work
[04:59:22] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: I didn't think so
[05:00:42] <dabear> ShawnRisk: can I ask why your code is so hard to read? why aren't you indenting your code?
[05:01:41] <ShawnRisk> dabear: I just forgot sorry.  I normally do this
[05:04:17] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: i would try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/UzmeJ/
[05:04:35] <coldhead> where the font size is saved using data()
[05:04:52] <coldhead> but that is not fool proof or elegant
[05:05:30] <ShawnRisk> let me try
[05:09:20] <coldhead> it probably has bugs, ShawnRisk, you will need to work on it
[05:09:26] <coldhead> but hey, i indented it for free
[05:09:34] <ShawnRisk> trying to fix
[05:09:42] <coldhead> good luck!
[05:10:50] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: This works, the only error was var in the if statement in normalfontsize
[05:11:09] <coldhead> good fix babe
[05:12:11] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: thanks for this.  This is really amazing work
[05:12:35] <dabear> wouldn't it be better to do this with classes?
[05:13:02] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: it's very lazy work, classes and relative font sizes would be much better :)
[05:13:47] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: if this works that is good for me.  I tried that once but it wasn't doing this right at all.
[05:14:09] <coldhead> yes sometimes whatever works is good enough
[05:14:24] <coldhead> then in 6 months you want to kill whoever took the shortcuts
[05:14:31] <coldhead> but they work for a different company now
[05:14:52] <ShawnRisk> hahaha
[05:16:30] <ShawnRisk> I have another question, but the code is huge and trying to isolate the problem is hard.  Should I pastebin the whole code or limit this?
[05:16:51] <coldhead> a reduced test case is the best
[05:17:01] <coldhead> the smallest amount of code that still has the problem
[05:17:19] <coldhead> you can often solve the problem by reducing it
[05:17:39] <coldhead> people will help more if they have less irrelevant code to look at
[05:17:50] <ShawnRisk> how many lines at most should I have?
[05:18:15] <coldhead> as few as possible
[05:18:20] <coldhead> it will depend on the problem
[05:18:26] <coldhead> also make sure you indent it
[05:18:27] <coldhead> ?beauty
[05:18:28] <bot-t> http://jsbeautifier.org
[05:19:12] <ShawnRisk> I am trying to get an accordion to close and open and I have code that does the opening but when I click the second one to close the first that doesn't do close the first one.
[05:19:37] <coldhead> oh man i was trying to help you with that 2 days ago
[05:20:00] <coldhead> i did you a simple working demo
[05:20:04] <ShawnRisk> yep but I have found other code
[05:20:20] <ShawnRisk> meaning if we work on this code, we can have the problem solved better.
[05:20:25] <ShawnRisk> It is the actual code for this
[05:20:44] <coldhead> if you can get it on jsfiddle people will be able to help with it
[05:20:59] <coldhead> otherwise we can't experiment with your code
[05:23:44] <ShawnRisk> do you want to look at it before I do that to see if you can see how to do this?
[05:26:21] <coldhead> i can't look at it now, try to get a working demo on jsfiddle for someone else to look at
[05:26:35] <coldhead> i am having a nosebleed
[05:27:07] <ShawnRisk> okay
[05:33:22] <juha___> fuck i hate coming in on sundays to restart some servers

[05:34:11] <juha___> ok, how much are you willing to pay?
[05:34:35] <syntech> you can pay me for free :)

[05:57:38] <termleech> i'm having some trouble setting the value of a hidden text box
[05:57:49] <termleech> i have a bunch of radio buttons
[05:57:59] <termleech> and when one of them is clicked i want to take it's value and put it in a hidden text box
[05:58:13] <termleech> however, when i try and set the value of the text box, it always set to 0
[05:58:16] <termleech> no matter what i do
[05:58:20] <termleech> can someone help me
[06:02:03] <termleech> ok, nevermind i guess you can't have the textbox hidden and set the value, but if you put a div around it and hide the div which hides the textbox it works
[06:22:34] <motaka2> lets say I have several check boxs with class="selected-years" , how can I reterieve the selected years ?
[06:22:46] <motaka2> I mean I need the values
[06:30:13] <fuchstronaut> $('.selected-years').prop('selected')
[06:30:37] <mbrevda> anyone familiar with the jsTree plugin?
[06:30:43] <fuchstronaut> with older jquery versions you'll have to use .attr('checked') instead of .prop('checked') @ motoka2
[07:14:46] <motaka2> fuchstronaut: here is the answer i found in stackflow, selectedYears = $(".selected-years:checked").map(
[07:14:48] <motaka2>         function () {return this.value;}).get().join(",");
[07:15:45] <fuchstronaut> excuse me?
[07:26:54] <sumit> how juery works

[08:05:34] <sveisvei> Anyone know how to feature test "beforeunload" ?
[08:11:51] <fuchstronaut> (sveisvei): from my experience beforeunload doesn't work in all browsers
[08:11:55] <fuchstronaut> at least not in the same way
[08:12:28] <fuchstronaut> ihp: this should be a string
[08:13:01] <sveisvei> fuchstronaut: True, so Im looking for some hackish way of testing it - or do I need to do *bad bad* useragent sniffing?
[08:14:49] <BrixSAt> hello
[08:15:11] <seven> hello
[08:15:40] <BrixSAt> why do i get on firebug a "200 ok" load status or a "302 Found" status and the browser always say error? http://cpark.virtual2.net/testes.html
[08:18:29] <fuchstronaut> (sveisvei): i think you are stuck with useragent sniffing
[08:18:42] <fuchstronaut> but i dont know much, so dont rely on what i say
[08:18:55] <seven> let me see
[08:21:07] <colin_> greetings
[08:22:06] <BrixSAt> :/
[08:22:08] <BrixSAt> weird
[08:24:35] <BrixSAt> any one got a clue?
[08:25:46] <colin_> i need some help with jQuery.draggable() and .droppable()
[08:26:14] <colin_> i have the basics working but still need to add some rules/functionality
[08:26:21] <colin_> this is what i have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/z6sYJ/
[08:26:48] <colin_> deelnemers = participants; wedstrijden = matches
[08:26:52] <seven> 累死我了,難道就沒有人懂中文嗎?
[08:27:00] <fr4nk> XD
[08:27:02] <seven> 看了半天的英文讓我眼花繚亂
[08:28:10] <colin_> when a team gets dropped in a field in one of the matches that field should no longer accept any more drops on it
[08:29:22] <colin_> at this moment i solved that by disabling the droppable() on a drop, but when a team gets moved to another field in one of the matches the field it was previously dropped in stays disabled
[08:29:26] <seven> 這個聊天的程式也是使用ajax做的啊
[08:30:51] <colin_> i also need to collect all the id's of the dropped elements in order
[08:31:01] <colin_> anyone around that wants to help me with this?
[08:31:21] <fr4nk> i have no idee how to do that, but can you just enable it again when you drag it to another field?
[08:31:50] <colin_> fr4nk i have no idea
[08:32:22] <seven> what are you want to do?
[08:32:37] <seven> <colin_> what are you want to do?
[08:32:48] <colin_> i just explained it
[08:33:56] <colin_> fr4nk one of the problems i'm having is that i don't know how to access for example the field that the current item originated from
[08:34:27] <fr4nk> like i said i have also no idee, didnt used draggable and sortable yet
[08:34:30] <colin_> field = DOM element
[08:34:59] <colin_> k
[08:35:03] <colin_> thnx anyway
[08:35:15] <colin_> anyone who HAS used it before?
[08:36:25] <seven> why show this bug?   (function(a,b){function ci(a){return d...a:a+"px")}}),a.jQuery=a.$=d})(window);
[08:36:41] <seven> who can tell me?
[08:37:00] <colin_> seven 累死我了,難道就沒有人懂中文嗎? i do understand some Chinese
[08:37:12] <fr4nk> wtf rly?? :D
[08:37:29] <seven> 太好了
[08:37:46] <colin_> I know
[08:37:48] <seven> 幫我看一下我用這一句讀取框架內的dom可是卻出錯了$(window.parent.frames["frameTop"].document).find("#a2").click(function(){
[08:37:58] <seven> 錯誤內容是(function(a,b){function ci(a){return d...a:a+"px")}}),a.jQuery=a.$=d})(window);
[08:38:29] <colin_> i said SOME chinese
[08:39:17] <colin_> no technical chinese ;)
[08:39:27] <seven> ok,i use this code to request iframe's dom but show error.$(window.parent.frames["frameTop"].document).find("#a2").click(function(){
[08:39:51] <seven> error message is:(function(a,b){function ci(a){return d...a:a+"px")}}),a.jQuery=a.$=d})(window);
[08:40:05] <colin_> thats not an error message
[08:40:37] <seven> not a error message?
[08:40:44] <colin_> no
[08:40:57] <colin_> it does not state any problems/errors
[08:41:14] <seven> this one?attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope
[08:42:08] <jonkri> is there some reason why i should necessarily define the "document ready" jquery hooks in <head>? i find it more convenient in my php coding to have them spread out in the document
[08:42:17] <seven> why firebug show this message?
[08:42:20] <jonkri> in some cases
[08:42:27] <colin_> your 'error message' looks like compressed javascript
[08:44:02] <colin_> 是否有错误信息前面的任何？
[08:44:10] <seven> the full message is:attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope:(function(a,b){function ci(a){return d...a:a+"px")}}),a.jQuery=a.$=d})(window); jquery....min.js（on line 16）
[08:45:43] <seven> This is shown in firebug
[08:45:48] <colin_> never saw that error before, sorry
[08:46:25] <seven> thank you
[08:49:00] <colin_> np
[08:49:06] <seven> if html code is this:<iframe id='a'></iframe><iframe id='b'></iframe>  How can I in b to control iframe a's dom?
[08:49:15] <colin_> so anyone experienced with jQuery UI?
[08:50:27] <seven> can i use this code to control?$(window.parent.frames["a"].document).find("#a2").click(function(){});
[08:50:57] <seven> or other Better idea
[08:52:23] <seven> <colin_> can you teach me?
[08:53:20] <seven> who can teach me?if html code is this:<iframe id='a'></iframe><iframe id='b'></iframe>  How can I in b to control iframe a's dom?
[08:53:44] <reisio> ha!
[08:53:44] <colin_> maybe you can access the parent first with top.document
[08:55:07] <seven> how to change this?$(window.parent.frames["a"].document).find("#a2").click(function(){});
[08:57:50] <seven> thank you ,i use this $(window.top.frames["frameTop"].document).find("#a2").click(function(){}) can control it,and nothing to show.
[08:58:46] <John3> I wonder how I could add a bit of text after this number print out "$('#charCounter').html(charLength);". That shows me lets say "89". How could I add so it sais "89 numbers"?

[09:32:17] <underW> i logout
[09:32:23] <underW> bye!

[09:37:25] <Pitel> is there someone who understand jquery templating? How can I use it if I have just array (so, $("#template").tmpl([1,2.3]).appendTo(something))? What should I write in the template?
[09:43:26] <misterm_> Pitel: you probably want something like var html = "<li>${num}</li>";$.template("numbers", html);$.tmpl("numbers", [{num: 1}, {num:2.3}]).appendTo(something)
[09:44:24] <Pitel> misterm_: so I can't use to justs imple array
[09:45:36] <misterm_> Pitel: you can use an array, but I'm pretty sure it expects name/value pairs so it'd be an array of objects, with the template being rendered once for each
[09:45:54] <austen> Ok... I have a function called drawLevelControls() which writes a block of HTML inside of a div. Some of the HTML elements (buttons) have onclick methods attached to them. However, once the HTML is inserted into the DOM the onclick methods do not call. Any ideas?
[09:45:54] <Pitel> anyway, i'm currently wondering why $("#slide").tmpl(data).appendTo(slideshow); gives me Object  has no method 'appendTo'
[09:47:18] <austen> I've tried both embedding the onclick within the <button> element, as well as explicitly setting .bind() for the elements I want to have behavior after the .html() insert.
[09:47:46] <wookiehangover> ? live
[09:47:47] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[09:48:31] <wookiehangover> austen: to bind event handler's the best approach is to use live or delegate events
[09:48:58] <wookiehangover> they rely on DOM bubbling rather than direct attachment to a DOM node
[09:49:41] <misterm_> Pitel: you must be messing up somewhere
[09:51:00] <jonkri> how can i make the mouse scroll events over a certain container scroll the container's arbitrary (html) scroll?
[09:52:25] <colin_> jonkri probly with the onScroll event
[09:53:52] <jonkri> thanks colin_
[09:54:03] <colin_> np
[09:54:19] <colin_> gonna play some Leauge of Legends bbl
[09:54:34] <misterm_> have fun
[09:59:28] <Pitel> misterm_: yup, I do... I'm calling .remove() on the dom object which the template script is part of... dumb me :]
[09:59:56] <misterm_> Pitel: it happens to everyone
[10:01:05] <jonkri> colin_, i've read about the event, but i don't see how to make a html scroll change on mouse scrolling (i want to scroll a horizontal scroll on a div)
[10:01:18] <jonkri> oh, have fun playing lol :)
[10:01:54] <wookiehangover> ? scrollTo @ jonkri
[10:01:55] <bot-t> jonkri, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[10:02:34] <jonkri> thanks wookiehangover
[10:02:45] <Pitel> misterm_: oh, and I just found out how to use simple array -- use ${$data} in template ;)
[10:09:22] <dnsdds> Can I use jQuery to simulate what overflow: auto; in a container div does to floats, with a position: absolute;?
[10:10:06] <dnsdds> i.e. I have a <body> that's 100% height, and a position:absolute div inside it that's even taller, and the body doesn't acknowledge this height and adjust to contain the div
[10:17:11] <thun> If I have a div inside of a table td... it is hidden a load and I show it via jquery... all works well but it expands the td when it is show... is there a way to have it float on top and not expand the td it is inside of?
[10:26:25] <caral> hi
[10:32:29] <Lion31> Boris Moore are you here? :D
[10:32:35] <marcus83> hoi o/
[10:32:41] <Lion31> I have a questin regardin jquery templates
[10:33:06] <marcus83> is it possible that there is a mistake on the jquery ui api documentation for dialogs?
[10:33:09] <marcus83> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Button
[10:33:11] <Lion31> is it better to have an evauated function or have {{if} in the template?
[10:33:21] <Lion31> which one performs faster?
[10:34:03] <snover> function calls are always slower. if you are using jquery templating though, you are clearly not interested in speed :)
[10:34:34] <Lion31> let's say I have a get_photo function that checks if the photo is set.. if(this.data.photo == null) return "/media/no_photo.png"; else return this.data.photo; .....
[10:34:50] <Lion31> so you are saying the jquery official templating is slow?
[10:35:48] <Lion31> until today I was using replaceAll({item.val}, item.val) for each iteration of my template... I think this was slower, right?
[10:38:42] <snover> yes, it is slow compared to other templating engines.
[10:39:24] <KurtB> Hi folks... I'm trying to get a jquery handle on an edit form that loads in an overlay (I want to override a file upload field.)
[10:39:43] <KurtB> document.onLoad or document.ready, don't seem to apply in the overlay, and $(#divname).load didn't seem to work, either
[10:40:35] <KurtB> Any ideas how I can hook objects that let loaded into an overlay?
[10:41:33] <misterm_> KurtB: what do you mean by "hook"?
[10:41:56] <misterm_> KurtB: you can attach listeners to dom elements that don't exist yet using event delegation if that's what you mean
[10:42:55] <Lion31> snover: which one is faster?
[10:44:07] <Fighter1405> Anyone familiar with the colorbox plugin for jQuery?
[10:44:29] <misterm_> Fighter1405: did you have a question about it or something?
[10:44:48] <Fighter1405> Yeah, I have this page: http://sitegather.com/wedding/gallery.php
[10:44:59] <Fighter1405> And it's behaving oddly, behind the images and none of the controls display
[10:45:01] <misterm_> Fighter1405: just ask, anyone who can answer will
[10:45:08] <Fighter1405> Don't know if anyone has any idea why :-s
[10:46:02] <KurtB> misterm, That sounds like what I'm looking for.
[10:46:38] * KurtB googles event delegation
[10:46:57] <misterm_> KurtB: check out $().live() and $().delegate()
[10:47:15] <KurtB> misterm: thanks!
[10:47:29] <misterm_> np
[10:55:29] <Lion31> I am getting ~130ms rendering with my old replaceAll method, and ~170ms with jquery tpl.... about 30% difference... but jquery tpl is stil in beta and getting better and faster.... mine will be always the same
[10:55:37] <Lion31> so what should I do?
[10:55:51] <Lion31> + jquery's is more flexible and feature rich
[10:56:16] <Fighter1405> Fixed it, nevermind :)
[10:56:38] <KurtB> Lion31, Gee... is the performance hit currently noticible to your users?
[10:57:12] <Lion31> of course not 50ms is nothing
[10:57:43] <Lion31> but it adds aditional 6kb
[10:58:05] <Lion31> of course only frirst time the page is loaded
[10:58:46] <Lion31> are there any better templating systems? I don't need complex ones
[10:59:36] <KurtB> Lion31, If you need the additional functionality today, and 6kbytes won't break the bank, tpl seems like a reasonable way to go. ;-)
[11:00:19] <KurtB> If you don't need the extra bells and whistles... yo might want to wait... or contribute to make it faster.
[11:01:03] <KurtB> Lion31, Sometimes, less _is_ more, though. ;-)
[11:01:17] <Lion31> :)
[11:01:33] <austen> wookiehangover: thanks! got it working. :)
[11:02:07] <Lion31> i'd be using it for: http://razvoj.mesetar.com/oglasi/spisek/zadnji_oglasi.html
[11:07:27] <sean`> ?preloading
[11:09:50] <KurtB> Lion31, Nice work.  (Makes me realize ho much my js chops suck!)  :-o
[11:10:41] <Lion31> thanks... yeah...been working on the app for more than a year now... willgo publick in a couple of weeks... can't wait
[11:17:49] <SoftLight> Hello, how do I auto submit a form on page load ?
[11:18:43] <Lion31> $(document).ready(function(){ $('#fomr_id').submit(); });
[11:21:43] <Lion31> hmm... render plugin from Boris Moore (the same author) works much faster... as fast as 65ms.... but cannot get photos to work properly with {{if}} have to repair something... but it's considerable faster
[11:22:20] <Paganini> fomr FTW!

[11:36:18] <misterm_> fabiobik: sorry to hear that, not really a j-query related question though
[11:36:36] <misterm_> fabiobik: all you can do really is talk to your host/the police, figure out how it happened and make sure it doesn't again
[11:36:41] <fabiobik> ya i need some advice
[11:37:08] <misterm_> fabiobik: I'd try somewhere that is focused on security rather than a javascript library

[11:48:52] <SoftLight> :(
[11:51:03] <andholt> need some input - i want to add a class to all images on a site (I'm building a bookmarklet), but not all images are present or visible when the page loads. Right now I'm using SetInterval to constantly scan the  dom and add a class to unscanned images, but I think using .delegate() might work better. However, I don't have a user event to bind. Is it possible to use .delegate() or something similar without an actual event?
[11:51:36] <andholt> basically just add a class to all images now or in the future
[11:53:54] <misterm_> andholt: what do you need to add the class for?
[11:54:24] <andholt> misterm_: I'm building a bookmarklet that needs to add a class to all images on the page
[11:54:39] <misterm_> andholt: yes, I understand that, I mean *why* does it need to add a class?
[11:55:25] <andholt> misterm_: it's necessary for the way our bookmarklet is going to work - I can't talk about the bookmarklet though (it's under wraps_
[11:55:38] <andholt> seems like the livequery plugin might do what I want
[11:55:42] <misterm_> andholt: where I'm going is...if it's for styling, why not just style the image tags directly...or if it's for collecting them, you can just collect by tag name
[11:55:42] <xarxer> Ohai there.. I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/7QBmk/  And I want to make the label change color when the input field is focues.. could anyone help? (I have JqueryUI so color changing is not the problem)
[11:56:21] <misterm_> andholt: yea, there are some dom modification events that you can listen for, and then fallback on a timer in browsers that don't support it
[11:56:28] <andholt> misterm_: it's for styling - what do you mean by style the image tags directly?
[11:56:31] <andholt> ok, thanks
[11:56:34] <PrinceES> how can i know the string position in jquery?
[11:56:43] <misterm_> andholt: if possible, I would avoid adding a class
[11:56:44] <PrinceES> is there any specific function that i can use for it
[11:56:55] <misterm_> andholt: it's more work for no reason
[11:57:06] <misterm_> andholt: there's many ways to style, not just based on class
[11:57:10] <andholt> misterm_: you mean just modify the style directly
[11:57:15] <andholt> gotcha
[11:57:16] <misterm_> andholt: you can write a css rule for image tags
[11:57:31] <misterm_> andholt: which would just work for all images added to the page
[11:57:37] <PrinceES> in php there is a function strpos()
[11:57:39] <misterm_> andholt: no need to worry
[11:57:47] <PrinceES> and i want to know if there is any function that i can use
[11:58:05] <PrinceES> just want to know the string position
[11:58:19] <andholt> ok, I'll see if that might work. I suspect it won't be any easier, since I'm modifying other aspects of the images
[11:58:21] <madprops> i dont get it, i've tried 3 different lightboxes and i can't get anyone to work. I'm trying this now, http://balupton.github.com/jquery-lightbox/demo/
[11:58:31] <aghouseh> anyone here on time warner and having connection issues?
[11:58:34] <madprops> I've added the plugin in the head, it loads correctly
[11:58:36] <andholt> i'll see if that makes life easier though, thanks
[11:58:43] <madprops> i've added rel='lightbox' to the links with images
[11:58:53] <madprops> yet when i click them they open in a new tab
[11:59:52] <misterm_> andholt: what do you mean "other aspects"?
[12:00:42] <andholt> misterm_: I'll be adding a div over every image, doing mouseenter mouseout event handlers, etc.
[12:00:52] <PrinceES> how can i know the string position in jquery?
[12:02:09] <misterm_> andholt: ah, in that case yea, you'll have to listen for dom events/use timers...but it will make the styling easier
[12:02:27] <misterm_> andholt: or you might use it to like hide the images until you're able to process something like that
[12:02:58] <andholt> misterm_: would you recommend just using timers, or something like this? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[12:03:09] <andholt> the timers I'm using now function fine, but I'm worried about performance
[12:03:29] <andholt> (unless JQuery.delegate and similar methods just use timers themselves)
[12:04:13] <Sempra> PrinceES: Do you mean the location of data inside of a string?
[12:06:03] <misterm_> andholt: well delegate isn't precisely what you need
[12:06:25] <misterm_> andholt: at least, it won't cover all your needs, I'm not sure how livequery works..so I don't know about that either
[12:06:37] <andholt> misterm_: right, I really need a selector for all images for all time (even future images when they get added to the DOM)
[12:07:00] <misterm_> andholt: how delegate works is it takes advantage of event bubbling
[12:07:20] <misterm_> andholt: so you can tell it to listen for say, click events from elements that may not exist yet
[12:07:36] <misterm_> andholt: however, if you need to do some action when the image element is created, it won't help you
[12:07:46] <andholt> misterm_: yah, that's my problem
[12:08:00] <PrinceES> <Sempra> yes
[12:08:02] <misterm_> andholt: in that case, I would use a combination of DOM events and fallback on timers
[12:08:13] <andholt> misterm_: ok, thanks
[12:08:18] <misterm_> andholt: I'm not sure if there's a jQuery plugin to wrap that, there might be
[12:09:24] <Sempra> PrinceES: You want to look into indexOf() method
[12:10:43] <Sempra> Might be a plugin out there that makes some kind of tool to do these tupes of comparisons, but that is what I use for simple checks.
[12:31:38] <ckb> ay fellas, quick question.
[12:32:40] <ckb> What would be the easiest way to perform ajax calls on specified anchors and replace a part of the current dom with the response of the ajax call, as well as binding the events that need to be bound?
[12:35:00] <misterm_> ckb: what do you mean "perform ajax calls on an anchor"?
[12:35:27] <ckb> ("a.ajax").click() for instance
[12:35:36] <misterm_> ckb: but yea, you would pretty much do the ajax calls, and then replace the dom and bind listeners in the success callback
[12:35:54] <misterm_> ckb: that doesn't perform an ajax call
[12:36:02] <misterm_> ckb: it just fires the click event on the anchor
[12:36:11] <ckb> misterm_: I have a init() function I'm trying to use to bind the events
[12:36:17] <ckb> misterm_: I'm aware.
[12:36:31] <misterm_> ckb: so I'm still unclear what you mean
[12:36:41] <misterm_> ckb: where is this init function and when does it fire?
[12:36:45] <ckb> I have issues trying to explain what my problem is
[12:37:04] <misterm_> ckb: you can always use event delegation to attach listeners for the dom elements you will add in the future
[12:37:16] <ckb> it fires on docready or  whenever I call it. It has a single parameter to pass in context to use
[12:37:28] <ckb> misterm_: grand idea!
[12:37:45] <ckb> I -definitely- forgot about delegation
[12:38:20] <ckb> then I don't have to fux with contextual binding
[12:39:30] <ckb> misterm_: in the delegate callback, can I stop the bubble up to the document?
[12:39:40] <Sempra> +1 for usage of "fux."
[12:39:44] <ckb> just as if I was using click(function() { })
[12:40:00] <misterm_> ckb: it depends on where you are delegating to
[12:40:08] <ckb> #albums .album
[12:40:24] <misterm_> ckb: that has no meaning to me, since I don't know your document structure
[12:40:28] <misterm_> ckb: what I mean is
[12:40:43] <ckb> I don't want to click to go past .album'
[12:40:46] <ckb> s parent
[12:40:56] <ckb> and I'm delegating .album's parent
[12:40:56] <misterm_> ckb: you have to delegate the listeners to some parent element, which will handle the events for any of it's future children
[12:41:19] <misterm_> ckb: the events will naturally have to make it to that element, but otherwise you can do whatever
[12:41:46] <ckb> yes
[12:42:15] <ckb> so it will stop the event from going up it's anscestors if I stop it in the delegation?
[12:43:55] <misterm_> ckb: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:03:28] <kenthree> hey, I have a div with a click event, how do I make <a>s inside this div not trigger the event?
[13:03:44] <gnarf> kenthree: two options
[13:03:52] <sjl> Anyone seen this while using jQuery UI's draggables before? d(this).data("draggable") is undefined
[13:03:53] <gnarf> kenthree: 1: stopPropagation on the children click events
[13:04:13] <gnarf> kenthree: 2: check event.target in your div's click
[13:04:23] <madprops> will this assign the function to each of those links or do I have to loop each one of them and assign it? 		$('a[rel=lightbox]').click(function(event){
[13:04:23] <madprops> 			event.preventDefault();
[13:04:24] <madprops> 		});
[13:04:32] <gnarf> i.e. if ( $( event.target ).is( "a" ) ) return;
[13:05:03] <gnarf> madprops: almost all jQuery functions implicity loop their matched elements
[13:05:14] <gnarf> meaning, you don't need to use .each
[13:05:28] <gnarf> so yes, it binds to all of the matched elements
[13:05:31] <kenthree> gnarf: for stopPropagation method I would add another event to the <a> ?
[13:05:47] <gnarf> kenthree: yup
[13:05:56] <kenthree> thanks! that looks simple enough
[13:08:32] <Paganini> sjl, what's inside your .draggable parentheses? it sounds like whatever you have there is returning false
[13:09:16] <sjl> Paganini: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=AMe9erWh
[13:11:04] <sjl> Paganini: the dragging (almost) works fine, and the positions are exchanged within the sortable, but it never gets to that console.log
[13:11:51] <ckb> can you delegate focus and blur events?
[13:12:35] <hp_> I want to bind a function to an element's load event but have the function ran even if the binding happenned after the element loaded. Reading about jQuery defferred objects makes me think I might solve my problem with them but I don't quite see how.
[13:14:35] <Paganini> sjl: sorry man, it looks fine to me :/ so the whole things working except for showing the console log?
[13:15:14] <sjl> Paganini: Well, and the stuff that I want to put inside, yes.
[13:16:33] <Paganini> can you put snippet up on jsfiddle? it doesn't look like draggable() is the issue
[13:17:07] <sjl> Hmm, if I put a start function on the draggable THAT gets called, just not stop()
[13:18:37] <Paganini> oops doesn't look like jsfiddle has jquery ui
[13:19:23] <Paganini> if stop isn't being called, does that mean after you start dragging you can't put it down?
[13:19:38] <sjl> Paganini: No, I can put it down fine.
[13:19:47] <Zelfje> how do i add a css class to a gmap image overlay? i tried $("div.gmnoprint img[src='.png']".addClass("mystyle");
[13:20:08] <Zelfje> this didnt work, perhpas due to that the images are loaded last, after the markers
[13:20:45] <Zelfje> [src$='.png'] ^^
[13:20:56] <Paganini> just change stop: to stop: function(){alert('help')};
[13:21:23] <Paganini> sjl do you get the alert?
[13:21:49] <sjl> Paganini: Nope, I still get that error I mentioned.
[13:22:34] <Paganini> sjl are you modifying the draggable element any other way?
[13:22:53] <Paganini> say, sorting the elements container?
[13:22:56] <sjl> Paganini: Not before that console.log should be called, no
[13:23:06] <Paganini> I don't mean inside draggable()
[13:23:31] <sjl> Paganini: The parent is made a sortable before the draggables are even created
[13:27:23] <Paganini> sjl wait a sec
[13:27:28] <Paganini> sjl you have to set your helper to clone
[13:27:45] <Paganini> if you're using ConnectToSortable, according to jquery ui to work flawlessly
[13:27:48] <Paganini> "Allows the draggable to be dropped onto the specified sortables. If this option is used (helper must be set to 'clone' in order to work flawlessly)"
[13:46:01] <macabre> does anyone have experience with cufon?
[13:46:28] <snover> macabre: don’t. use woff.
[13:46:43] <macabre> snover: not my choice..
[13:46:50] <snover> people say that so often
[13:47:19] <snover> so rarely is it really true
[13:50:17] <misterm_> snover: sure there's *always* a choice, but it's a question of how attractice each one is
[13:51:09] <snover> WOFF is both the best choice and the easiest choice, really :)
[13:51:36] <misterm_> snover: I mean in terms of compromising vs annoying your boss/client or something like that
[13:52:51] <misterm_> It's best to try and convince people to do it the right way, but sometimes you have to pick your battles :-/
[14:02:00] <hayer> How can I select only anchors with a class? Something like $("a .linkclass").click(function(e){..}); ?
[14:03:08] <aghouseh> can i just vent real quick? PUT AN EFFING LABEL ON YOUR INPUT FIELDS, A-HOLES
[14:04:37] <misterm_> hayer: $("a.linkclass") should do it
[14:06:59] <hayer> misterm_, does not seem to work..
[14:08:11] <kenthree> hayer: without space, otherwise it's descendants
[14:08:26] <misterm_> hayer: then you are doing something wrong, or leaving something out
[14:08:30] <hayer> kenthree, already tried..
[14:08:56] <kavelot> how do I set the value of a <span> next to an checkbox as this checkbox value? something like $(':checkbox').next('span').html([here's the value of the :checkbox]);
[14:09:39] <hayer> This is my link .. <a class="newscofirm" href="<?= site_url("news/delete/" . $N->id )?>"> .. and this is my js .. $("a.newsconfirm").click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); alert("Pressed"); } ..
[14:09:49] <hayer> The click is not getting called.
[14:09:58] <misterm_> hayer: there's a mispelling
[14:10:42] <hayer> <_> thanks. Now send me back to kindergarden.
[14:12:19] <misterm_> hayer: ha, everyone has off moments
[14:30:34] <vesul> hey is there a way to change radio buttons to look slicker with jquery?
[14:30:59] <vesul> an example - http://nr.vesul.com/ click "strains"
[14:31:28] <misterm_> vesul: check out jQuery UI
[14:31:56] <vesul> i did, i got confused about what all i actually needed to dl
[14:32:04] <aghouseh> vesul: also might be a good idea to let the anchors show in the url
[14:32:19] <vesul> yeah i think ill change that
[14:32:26] <aghouseh> nod
[14:32:31] <vesul> so it says nr.vesul.com/#strains  right?
[14:32:54] <aghouseh> yeah
[14:33:05] <aghouseh> just so theres a copyable URL to a specific area of conent
[14:33:07] <aghouseh> content
[14:33:30] <vesul> cool, i think the jquery scroller i'm using allows that
[14:33:32] <vesul> just need to turn it on
[14:33:41] <aghouseh> most likely yeah
[14:34:04] <vesul> would jquery UI enable me to change the radio buttons i have on there to something like these buttons? http://razorjack.net/quicksand/
[14:34:35] <aghouseh> well, theoretically you could make it look like anything you want if you theme it
[14:34:51] <aghouseh> but jquery-ui has default themes you can choose from
[14:34:56] <misterm_> vesul: yes
[14:35:14] <vesul> okay cool. never used jquery ui before, i guess i should give it a shot for ocne
[14:35:30] <vesul> my only confusion comes in here, do i need all this stuff? http://jqueryui.com/download
[14:35:39] <vesul> probably not the interaction stuff right?
[14:35:43] <vesul> or the widgets?
[14:35:45] <vesul> just core?
[14:36:32] <vesul> i can probably scrap the lightbox thing i'm using and use the one in jquery UI too right?
[14:37:02] <misterm_> vesul: core, and then whatever else you plan on using
[14:39:10] <vesul> looks like this is what i probably need - http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio
[14:40:21] <misterm_> yup
[14:40:56] <vesul> sweet, "le frog" looks like it'll be a good base theme
[14:40:57] <vesul> also
[14:45:41] <ckb> how do I unbind a delegation? and does it take away from effeciency if I keep undelegating/delegating the same parent?
[14:48:13] <nascro> Hey folks! I have several divs with the same class (HTML: http://pastie.org/2300686) on a page. How do I perform an animation on only one class that is visible in the current modal box? What I have created here (JavaScript: http://pastie.org/2300673) applies the animation to every photos and project class. I realize I need to either re-write my function or use something other than the .each() method. Welcome any thoughts or suggestions.
[14:49:37] <misterm_> ckb: http://api.jquery.com/undelegate/
[14:52:03] <misterm_> nascro: you probably want to do something like only animate the divs that are children of the current modal box (with the relevent class)
[14:52:05] <ckb> misterm_: is it bad to always be running .undelegate().delegate() on the same selectors?
[14:52:13] <misterm_> ckb: bad in what sense?
[14:52:15] <ckb> misterm_: What would make it more efficient?
[14:52:18] <ckb> performance
[14:52:37] <ckb> Let me show you this excerpt..
[14:52:43] <misterm_> ckb: obviously it's work to do that, but I wouldn't worry about it unless you hit actual problems
[14:53:32] <ckb> k
[14:54:15] <coldhead> ?optimisation
[14:54:15] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[14:55:02] <nascro> misterm: is there a method that does that, or do I need to write a custom function? Part of what I'm stuck on is how I find out what the current modal box is in the first place. Then I can change my selectors to work with that method.
[14:55:18] <nascro> misterm: hopefully that made some sense
[14:56:07] <misterm_> nascro: you'd just find what box is active, and then write a query for it's children
[14:56:25] <misterm_> nascro: that's assuming that the div you want to animate is a child element of the box
[14:56:43] <misterm_> nascro: tbh I don't feel like wading through your code to try and figure out what it all does
[14:57:03] <kenthree> does .data() modify the actual attribute pre 1.6?
[14:59:41] <Pymous> Woooooo, lot's of ppl !
[15:02:05] <misterm_> kenthree: can you clarify what you mean?
[15:02:21] <nascro> misterm: I don't blame you! What is the best way to determine what the active modal is?
[15:02:39] <misterm_> nascro: that
[15:02:56] <misterm_> 's what I mean...I'd have to read through your program and figure it all out
[15:03:13] <misterm_> nascro: presumably your code is what is "activating" the modal, so you should be able to tell
[15:03:16] <vesul> jquery UI is slick! got the filter thing changed up
[15:04:27] <Pymous> I'm trying to resize some images (with the same class), but when i'm trying put my code in action (inside .ready(), ...), the width is wrong ! (zero, or less than the image)
[15:04:37] <Pymous> How and when I can resize my image properly ? :)
[15:05:24] <Pymous> Oh ! And some aren't displayed at start too
[15:05:29] <misterm_> nascro: if you want to try to explain exactly what you are trying to animate, and exactly what this code does, I'd be happy to listen and offer advice if I can
[15:05:49] <nascro> misterm: Thanks. I'm using a plugin for the modal. I've written custom js for the animate feature. It's essentially sliding divs left and right to hide/show children divs.
[15:07:05] <nascro> But since I have multiple divs with the same class name/children, and I'm using the .each()method on the parent class, it's animating over and over again on a .click() instead of just once.
[15:07:47] <GrizzLyCRO1> hello, i cant figure out how to send element that fired event in one line to function
[15:08:03] <misterm_> Pymous, when .ready() can be fired before all assets (such as images) are loaded
[15:08:14] <GrizzLyCRO1> $(#id).click(magic(this));
[15:08:19] <Pymous> Yeah, I tried this:
[15:08:22] <misterm_> Pymous: try using load
[15:08:32] <Pymous> http://pastebin.com/myPVZJYR
[15:08:42] <Pymous> So, my first image is correctly resized
[15:08:49] <slaeke> sup all
[15:08:59] <slaeke> is dabear around by any chance?
[15:08:59] <Pymous> but the hidden one (from my caroussel) isn't :(
[15:09:08] <kenthree> misterm: i was asking if .data('foo', 'bar'); was the same as .attr('data-foo', 'bar'); but I dont think so?
[15:09:39] <GrizzLyCRO1> kenthree: i think it has same effect
[15:10:00] <nascro> misterm_: Perhaps a solution would be to add a class "active" to the parent when a state is clicked.
[15:10:11] <kenthree> GrizzLyCRO1: but it doesnt show up in the dom when debugging with firebug for example, if you use .data
[15:10:26] * slaeke pokes dabear
[15:10:26] <misterm_> kenthree: no
[15:11:26] <slaeke> so here's an interesting question
[15:11:34] <slaeke> i am building a site for a real estate client
[15:11:50] <slaeke> and I'm having to deal with some weird thrid party service for MLS IDX listing searches
[15:11:58] <misterm_> kenthree: see the source for $().data() for details
[15:12:04] <GrizzLyCRO1> kenthree: i am not sure if it shows in dom, i think it worked for me in chrome..
[15:12:24] <GrizzLyCRO1> i think it was in some unusual place for it, but it was saved in dom
[15:12:32] <slaeke> I want to build a slideshow of featured listings, but the only wat I can get access to the listings is to have the third party service run a script that builds divs and such and does the slideshow part for me
[15:12:36] <GrizzLyCRO1> unusual for me(and i am newbie)
[15:12:56] <misterm_> nascro: something like that might work, if you're using a plugin for the modals, it might already be adding a class to the active one in order to style it
[15:13:13] <misterm_> nascro: or you might be able to hook into it some other way, depends on the plugin you are using
[15:13:18] <slaeke> so i'm wondering how I can use jQuery when the third party script finishes and manipulate the divs that it creates to make my own slideshow
[15:13:54] <nascro> misterm_: checking into that now. Plugin is called "Reveal" by Zurb. Link: http://bit.ly/i27F05
[15:13:55] <slaeke> should I just test for the existence of some child div?
[15:14:17] <misterm_> slaeke: your description is a little vague
[15:14:37] <slaeke> ya, didnt want to get into all the crazy little details....but I'll give it a shot
[15:14:48] <slaeke> how familiar are you with real estate stuff? :)
[15:15:04] <misterm_> slaeke: well I'm not saying you have to get into it
[15:15:07] <nascro> slaeke: what 3rd party MLS service are you working with?
[15:15:13] <slaeke> idxbroker.com
[15:15:35] <slaeke> they host some search pages, results pages, and have options to make slideshows
[15:15:50] <slaeke> and was the only one I found that let me use custom styles
[15:16:05] <slaeke> so, i'm trying to add a "featured listing" slider to the home page
[15:16:28] <slaeke> and the options for creating the "custom slideshow" INSIDE idxbroker's default options aren't enough to do what I want
[15:16:58] <slaeke> so, I need to take the output of their slideshow script, and mess with it to put it into another slider with better formatting, my styles, etc
[15:17:19] <slaeke> only problem is I don't know how to tell my jQuery code to only run when that particular script is finished
[15:18:08] <slaeke> is that a bette desc?
[15:18:10] <slaeke> *better
[15:19:28] <misterm_> slaeke: a little, but the only way you could get useful advice would be for someone to look at the actual page being generated by the third party
[15:19:39] <misterm_> slaeke: and having more information about how you are interacting with it
[15:19:45] <ckb> is there a way I can animate the height of an element as if the height wasn't specified?
[15:19:54] <slaeke> so, its not a page, the only thing they give me is:
[15:19:56] <nascro> misterm_: This is the listener for the data-reveal-id attribute. Each area (yeah, I'm working with an image map...) has this attribute/value added to it already, though.
[15:20:01] <slaeke> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.providencerealtygroupnc.idxco.com/idx/11166/customSlideshowJS.php?stp=basic&name=NewSlideShowName&pt=sfr&lp=200000&hp=800000&ba=0&srt=DESC&slideshowWidth=740&slideshowHeight=225&imageWidth=250&imageHeight=188&rotation=10&propCount=5&alignment=left&backgroundColor=333333"></script>
[15:20:18] <slaeke> that script pulls the info about the listings
[15:20:20] <nascro> misterm_:http://pastie.org/2300827
[15:20:23] <slaeke> and builds a few divs
[15:20:44] <misterm_> slaeke: alright, you'd have to pick the script apart to figure it out
[15:20:50] <nascro> misterm_: It's only 5 lines. I understand only part of it.
[15:21:10] <slaeke> so, there's no way that I could tell if the script has finished executing, then run my jQuery?
[15:21:24] <misterm_> slaeke: it depends
[15:21:49] <slaeke> on?
[15:22:11] <Pymous> Someone know a good image resizer plugin who work ? :)
[15:22:19] <misterm_> slaeke: a lot of things
[15:22:35] <slaeke> haha, well ok, like what?
[15:22:50] <misterm_> slaeke: for the most part, putting your script after that one will cause it to be read and executed after it
[15:22:54] <ckb> slaeke: why don't you just import MLS listings yourself? :\
[15:23:03] <ckb> it would make things a whole lot easier for you.
[15:23:06] <misterm_> slaeke: but that script may not be done doing the things it does
[15:23:35] <misterm_> slaeke: how you do it all depends on what exactly their script does
[15:23:45] <slaeke> @ckb, i have no access to importing any listings...besides, the "featured" part is determined by idxbroker
[15:23:55] <ckb> ah
[15:24:02] <slaeke> @misterm: checking the script now to see what is up
[15:24:40] <ckb> well then, you could set up a poll to check the element that gets populated with these featured listings.. and populate them in a hidden div.
[15:24:46] <ckb> that seems like a PITA, though'
[15:24:53] <ckb> and could cause a lot of problems
[15:25:25] <slaeke> yah, this whole site has been a PITA
[15:25:25] <ckb> then just iterate through them, etc.
[15:25:39] <dabear> slaeke: whaaat
[15:25:39] <ckb> realty usually is :)
[15:25:46] <slaeke> so, the script looks like PHP spitting out JS....
[15:25:57] <slaeke> haha, DABEAR! I'm back with another problem...
[15:26:02] <dabear> lol
[15:26:07] <misterm_> yea it'd prob be easier to just scrape their sight someone serverside
[15:26:13] <misterm_> *site somehow
[15:26:27] <slaeke> thats what their script does...heh
[15:26:33] <ckb> slaeke: just do this..
[15:26:50] <ckb> where the slideshow gets populated.. put it in a hidden div
[15:27:03] <ckb> then iterate through the slideshow's elements and do whatever you want with them
[15:27:30] <ckb> that or find a better idx ;)
[15:28:00] <slaeke> haha, I looked at LOTS of IDX's, but for my clients" MLS listings, this was the ONLY one that allowed me to style it, everything else was ifram
[15:28:01] <slaeke> e
[15:28:45] <ckb> function pollSlideshow() { if ($("#slideshow .elements").size() == 5) { parseSlideShow(); } } setInterval('pollSlideshow', 1000);
[15:28:48] * ckb shrugs
[15:29:10] <ckb> I always used FMLS
[15:29:26] <slaeke> do they list Triangle MLS?
[15:29:47] <ckb> and kept a copy of only the listings we wanted to (certain zips, areas, cities, etc)
[15:29:57] <ckb> I have no idea
[15:30:11] <ckb> does your MLS server use RETS?
[15:30:21] <slaeke> whats RETS?
[15:30:33] <ckb> Real-Estrate Transaction Service
[15:30:37] <ckb> I think..
[15:31:02] <ckb> If so:
[15:31:08] <slaeke> doubt it
[15:31:18] <slaeke> nothing about it on the website trianglemls.com
[15:31:51] <ckb> http://www.trianglemls.com/vendors.cfm/s/125/page/206
[15:32:15] <ckb> pay to be a vendor?
[15:32:22] <slaeke> heh, i'm not one,
[15:32:22] <ckb> fail
[15:32:25] <slaeke> my client is just an agent
[15:32:58] <nascro> misterm_: See current working page here: http://bit.ly/qMhGDT Click on California, then the right arrow to see behavior.
[15:33:34] <slaeke> there's another problem too
[15:34:06] <ckb> slaeke: might want to look into becoming a vendor with them, or an IDX that offers RETS
[15:34:18] <ckb> that would be the easiest.
[15:34:34] <slaeke> yeh, but this is the LAST thing I need to do for this site, then I'm finished
[15:34:38] <ckb> are you looking at just displaying the agent's listings and the featured listings?
[15:34:39] <slaeke> i just want to get this done and move on :)
[15:34:43] <slaeke> yep
[15:34:48] <slaeke> thats it
[15:34:59] <slaeke> and searching
[15:35:12] <ckb> so what's the issue with the slideshow they give you?
[15:35:16] <ckb> you can't specify no styling?
[15:36:21] <misterm_> nascro: it looks like what you need to do is paginate somehow
[15:36:36] <slaeke> not enough
[15:36:53] <slaeke> just font-size, background color
[15:36:58] <slaeke> and border
[15:37:28] <misterm_> nascro: give each of the animated divs a unique id, have a variable set to the intitially visible one, then move through them
[15:37:28] <slaeke> i MIGHT be able to tweak it
[15:50:29] <nascro> Is it possible to check an element for visibiilty == hidden <style="opacity: 1; visibility: hidden;"> ?
[15:50:43] <ckb> $("style:hidden")
[15:51:21] <ckb> errr
[15:51:23] <ckb> right?
[15:51:40] <ckb> yeah, that's right
[15:52:01] <ckb> nope
[15:52:47] <ckb> visibility still is considered visible.
[15:53:52] <nascro> ckb: yeah, saw that. "since they still consume space in the layout."
[15:54:07] <Zelfje> how do i add a css class to a gmap image overlay? i tried $("div.gmnoprint img[src$='.png']".addClass("mystyle");
[15:54:13] <Zelfje> this didnt work, perhpas due to that the images are loaded last, after the markers
[15:54:38] <Zelfje> any ideas on how to catch these overlay images in jQuery classes?
[15:54:49] <Zelfje> #googlemaps is dead :(
[15:56:09] <nascro> $('#foo').attr( {
[15:56:09] <nascro>   visibility: "visible"
[15:56:10] <nascro>   });
[15:56:28] <nascro> Better: $('#foo').attr({ visibility: "visible" });
[15:58:49] <nascro> Nope, that's wrong
[15:59:38] <nascro> $('#foo').attr({ style: "visibility: visible" }); ?
[16:01:18] <Moult> if i have foo = $(this).attr('id'); and alert(foo); doesn't pop up anything, what does foo contain? i tried doing if (!foo) { but that doesn't seem to catch it
[16:02:10] <misterm_> Moult: can you pastebin more of the context?
[16:02:18] <misterm_> Moult: it looks like "this" is not what you think it is
[16:02:51] <Moult> misterm_: yes, in fact i think $(this) may not exist.
[16:03:02] <Moult> that sounded strangely zen
[16:03:14] <LATerry> trying to do something when a user selects option="1" from a drop down list. Starting with $('select').change(function(){ but having difficulties afterwards. Any hand-holding appreciated
[16:03:50] <Moult> misterm_: but even just testing for if (!($(this))) doesn't catch it
[16:03:54] <LATerry> note, not interested in text value of select, just the option #, want to test for it
[16:04:32] <misterm_> Moult: I'm not sure what you mean by "catch it"
[16:04:46] <Moult> misterm_: return true
[16:04:55] <misterm_> Moult: like I said, you'd need to provide more code for me to determine whats going on
[16:05:38] * syntech is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[16:06:02] <misterm_> Moult: keep in mind $(something) will return a jQuery object
[16:06:27] <misterm_> Moult: when you do $(this) what you are doing is taking the current value of "this" and wrapping it in a new jQuery object
[16:06:54] <misterm_> Moult: this pattern is common because jQuery executes callbacks in the context of the element
[16:07:20] <Moult> misterm_: ok - but if this doesn't exist, then $(this) is an empty jquery object. correct? then $(this).attr('id') shall be null, is that right?
[16:07:54] <misterm_> Moult: undefined
[16:08:12] <misterm_> Moult: and it's probably not so much that this doesn't exist, but that it's not what you think it is
[16:08:38] <Moult> misterm_: i'm quite sure it doesn't exist, because i explitly remove it :)
[16:09:03] <misterm_> Moult: there will always be a "this" inside a function...it just might not point to what you expect it to
[16:09:47] <Moult> misterm_: ok - bear with me for moment here (i'm not a js coder) - so if i remove what this points to, then what does this become?
[16:10:43] <misterm_> Moult: can you do me a favor and just give me the context of the code in question
[16:11:00] <misterm_> Moult: what function does that line of code appear in?
[16:11:55] <Karzy> Anyone around that's got some experience with jquery mobile ?
[16:12:08] <Moult> misterm_: hmm, a bit hard to do so - i'm extending the fullcalendar jquery plugin
[16:12:13] <misterm_> Karzy: did you have a question or something?
[16:12:43] <misterm_> Moult: just stick the function that that line appears in into a pastebin
[16:12:46] <Karzy> misterm: Yeah, I'm trying to do a logo across multiple "pages" that and the postitioning is getting screwed I was just wondering if there's a best practice I'm missing
[16:13:06] <Mrfloyd_> any jqtouch around?
[16:13:08] <misterm_> Karzy: if you ever have a question, just ask it...anyone who can answer will
[16:14:51] <misterm_> Moult: but to answer your question, it's hard to because you can
[16:15:10] <misterm_> *can't really do that in a meaningful way
[16:15:40] <Mrfloyd_> how can i navigate from one page to another with page animation using jqtouch
[16:15:43] <misterm_> Moult: once a function's execution environment is set up, you can't change what "this" is
[16:15:58] <misterm_> Moult: so it's not so much that you
[16:16:17] <misterm_> *you're "removing this" as forcing the function to execute in the context of something else
[16:16:37] <Moult> misterm_: ah, i think i'm starting to see now
[16:17:03] <Moult> misterm_: thanks a lot for the help and explanation! i've got to run now but I do have some ideas of how to check exactly what's going on with this once i get back
[16:17:30] <misterm_> Moult: alright good luck
[16:20:48] <pnhChris> anyone know the guts of .wrap() enough to answer a question semi-related to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8015 ?
[16:22:19] <misterm_> pnhChris: just ask, if anyone can answer they will
[16:25:13] <pnhChris> well.... without tracing it myself.. looking to see what the underlying manipulation wrap() is doing that's causing that video bug in mobile safari, because in those tests, and my own tests non-jquery wrapping via innerHTML or cloneNode/replaceNode are working like a champ

[16:34:20] <DThought_> hi
[16:34:25] <DThought_> Whoa lots of people here...
[16:34:28] <DThought_> Anybody online?
[16:36:16] <misterm_> DThought_: what's up
[16:36:30] <DThought_> not bad
[16:36:33] <DThought_> Got a quick question.
[16:36:46] <dabear> no one online here
[16:36:50] <DThought_> Anybody know how fadeIn actually works?
[16:37:06] <DThought_> I assumed it was opacity, but then it works in IE7.
[16:37:10] <misterm_> DThought_: why not check the source and see yourself
[16:37:24] <DThought_> Yeah I'm doing that now.
[16:37:32] <DThought_> All the copies I have are min'd.
[16:37:44] <DThought_> Oh there it is.
[16:38:21] <DThought_> wat it says it's opacity: show
[16:49:25] <austinbv> does anyone have any pointers for initializing a canvas object when on this object for the plugin
[16:50:27] <dabear> does anybody know what punctuation and question marks are
[16:50:57] <austinbv> dabear: what?
[16:51:23] <dabear> sense. your post doesn't make any
[16:51:36] <Sempra> uh
[16:51:57] <austinbv> I am still not sure what you are asking
[16:52:48] <dabear> I cannot understand your initial question
[16:53:04] <austinbv> What are you asking?
[16:53:12] <Sempra> lol
[16:53:25] <Sempra> Watching this is funny.
[16:53:47] <dabear> I am not asking anything
[16:53:49] <dabear> you are
[16:54:11] <austinbv> I see,
[16:54:11] <LATerry> It's like watching a Turing test
[16:57:10] <LATerry> Are most jquery examples surrounded by the usual 	$(document).ready(function(){  ... }  code block?
[16:58:15] <dabear> just llok through the api docs?
[16:58:19] <dabear> and you will see
[16:58:22] <LATerry> and online, yes
[16:59:04] <dabear> in most cases, you should avoid doc ready though
[16:59:20] <dabear> and just put your code at the end, before </body>
[16:59:42] <dabear> code run there, will be run almost at the same time as doc ready, anyway
[17:00:06] <dabear> see for example here: http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[17:00:17] <dabear> the examples show that behavior too
[17:08:35] <crab> dabear: is it guaranteed that jquery.js would be loaded by then?
[17:09:10] <dabear> yes, scripts are executed in sequence
[17:09:38] <dabear> and the dom will be modifiable too
[17:10:17] <dabear> cya
[17:10:18] <crab> i've always worried about that (even though if it weren't loaded by then, $(document).ready would break too)
[17:14:45] <danieliser> creating a bunch of modals, is it possible to not define a height and still center the modal? only way i can get it so far is $(window).height() - $('#eModal-Container').height()) / 2 with a defined height
[17:42:02] <abjorn> qwery qwery qwery rockin everywhere

[17:52:14] <ubersoftware> hey guys … can ask a question
[17:52:15] <austinbv> how do you refrence the DOM element within a jquery plugin?
[17:55:25] <ubersoftware> I need to "look" into an element with id="ICad_text" for an certain image source and get a true or false --- whats the best way to tackle this.
[17:56:45] <austinbv> if $('#ICad_text').attr('src') === "the source you want"
[17:58:20] <ubersoftware> thanks
[17:58:22] <kenthree> austinbv: what do you mean? inside a plugin "this" is the object the function was called on. to get the actual dom element use .get
[18:09:19] <danieliser> any way to get the height of an element if its not defined?
[18:13:20] <kenthree> danieliser: http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/ ?
[18:13:27] <kenthree> also inner
[18:13:52] <madprops> this is so weird, i can't make a lightbox plugin to work in my server, when i try it on jsfiddle pointing to the files in the server using the same code it works. I even tried adding the plugin code into the jquery code and the css into my main css, the links have rel='lightbox' yet it never works :/
[18:16:44] <danieliser> kentrhee: none of the children have a defined size either so it returns 0 or 50 even though the actual size is close to 400
[18:18:14] <kenthree> got a link?
[18:19:13] <danieliser> basically loading forms from php via load into a modal window.. as of now im having to define a size with extra attributes on the link/button that opens them
[18:20:53] <xenyz> anyone familiar with the superfish menu?
[18:20:55] <danieliser> cant jsfiddle it because of the ajax.. i can try to get it up on my servers..
[18:21:08] <xenyz> I've got the oddest problem with it & webkit
[18:21:27] <kenthree> i'm not an expert so don't bother for me, though others might help if you do
[18:38:22] <austinbv> .33
[18:44:30] <danieliser> kentrhee: figured it out.. had to move it.. it was being called before the ajax load finished.. ie no content to measure.
[19:15:13] <RubyTN> how can I create an array from variables created in a .each loop?
[19:15:27] <RubyTN> here is the code:
[19:15:28] <RubyTN> $("div").each(function() {
[19:15:30] <RubyTN>     if($(this).is(":visible")) {
[19:15:31] <RubyTN>         //alert(this.Id);
[19:15:33] <RubyTN>         alert(this.id);
[19:15:34] <RubyTN>     }
[19:15:58] <RubyTN> I need to create an array of the id's instead of alerting the id
[19:16:05] <miketaylr> array.push?
[19:16:52] <miketaylr> or maybe $.fn.map and forgo the $.fn.each entirely
[19:17:15] <Ratatat> I am using .eq(0) to remove a class from the first of a list, on second attempt it fails to remove the next item's class, as if the first still has the class it removed already. Tips?
[19:18:09] <RubyTN> miketaylr:  tnx
[19:18:16] <RubyTN> I look into it
[19:19:41] <austinbv> can you manipulate a dom element instead of jquery object from within a plugin?
[19:22:22] <miketaylr> austinbv: yes
[19:22:43] <miketaylr> `this` within a plugin is generally a DOM element anyways
[19:23:07] <austinbv> this is a jquery object according to the man page
[19:23:35] <crab> what man page?
[19:23:49] <austinbv> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[19:24:25] <miketaylr> "This is a common slip up due to the fact that in other instances where jQuery accepts a callback, the this keyword refers to the native DOM element. "
[19:24:28] <miketaylr> from that page
[19:24:38] <cypha> hmm, I tried this tutorial, and it's not working! http://yensdesign.com/2008/09/how-to-create-a-stunning-and-smooth-popup-using-jquery/
[19:24:44] <cypha> http://69.84.109.187:6543/login
[19:24:51] <cypha> i can't figure out what's wrong
[19:25:28] <miketaylr> cypha: that version of jquery is 3 years old :S
[19:25:35] <austinbv> miketaylr: in the comments on that page // "this" is already a jquery object
[19:25:50] <cypha> oh
[19:25:52] <cypha> lol
[19:25:53] <cypha> good to know
[19:26:05] <cypha> miketaylr: do you know of an uptodate tutorial?
[19:26:16] <miketaylr> for making a lightbox type thingy?
[19:26:23] <Ratatat> cypha: in WGTN?
[19:27:08] <cypha> wgtn?
[19:27:15] <cypha> yeah, lightbox type thing
[19:27:16] <fris> whats the difference between .css('display','none') and .hide()
[19:27:30] <cypha> actually, I just want a popup window for the "forgot password" link
[19:27:30] <miketaylr> austinbv: right. within a plugin, there's generally an $.each(), and the this within that each is the DOM element.
[19:27:42] <cypha> where you can enter in your email addy
[19:27:58] <miketaylr> austinbv: but maybe that's not what you want
[19:28:07] <miketaylr> see also, ? .get()
[19:28:11] <miketaylr> ? .get()
[19:28:11] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[19:28:28] <Ratatat> cypha: nm, thought you might be someone else
[19:28:59] <miketaylr> ?source hide:
[19:28:59] <bot-t> Line#7470 - "hide: function( speed, easing, callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#7470
[19:29:26] <miketaylr> fris: hide can do more stuff, e.g. speed, easing, have a callback ;)
[19:29:29] <cypha> Ratatat-tat: that's okay. can I still get help? :)
[19:29:49] <fris> ahh ok
[19:30:12] <Sean-Der> What is the proper syntax to .remove(self);
[19:30:18] <Sean-Der> I can't get it to work
[19:31:11] <austinbv> miketaylr: running something like `this.getContext('2d')` does not work
[19:31:15] <austinbv> returns an empty function
[19:31:34] <miketaylr> then use $(this).get().getContext('2d')
[19:31:42] <miketaylr> or something
[19:32:06] <miketaylr> or just this.get().getContext('2d')
[19:32:28] <nascro> Hey folks. How do I check the value of a parent element's style attribute for visibility: visible?
[19:32:30] <austinbv> Yeah I have tried all those :/ I will keep googling
[19:32:48] <miketaylr> austinbv: what does it say when you console.log(this)?
[19:33:06] <cypha> miketaylr: know of a tutorial I can follow to make a very simple jquery popup?
[19:33:11] <cypha> from clicking alink
[19:33:13] <miketaylr> cypha: not off hand
[19:33:22] <miketaylr> ?g simple jquery lightbox tutorial
[19:33:23] <bot-t> miketaylr, Create a Lightbox effect only with CSS  no javascript needed ... - http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2007/08/22/create-a-lightbox-effect-only-with-css-no-javascript-needed/
[19:33:34] <miketaylr> probably not that :P
[19:33:43] <miketaylr> cypha: there are a million plugins that do that already
[19:33:52] <miketaylr> or you can build one from scratch by looking at the source of a plugin
[19:35:07] <cypha> miketaylr: i'd like to do it without a page refresh
[19:35:25] <miketaylr> that's possible, cypha
[19:35:36] <Ratatat> cypha: are you not just trying to build an absolutely position div that shows under a certain condition and has highest z-index?
[19:36:21] <cypha> well, I want it centered, and yes, with the highest z-index
[19:36:40] <cypha> but no page refresh
[19:38:21] <austinbv> miketaylr: it returns an entire dom window
[19:38:38] <miketaylr> austinbv: ok that sounds wrong. can you paste the code somewhere?
[19:39:06] <madprops> i have this script in my head but the images i load with ajax seem to not get affected, do I have to run the entire script to activate them again or is there a function I'm not seeing that I can just call? https://raw.github.com/balupton/jquery-lightbox/master/scripts/jquery.lightbox.js
[19:39:12] <austinbv> yeah 1 sec I will gist it
[19:39:58] <Ratatat> cypha: So first you need to either inject it into the page and then show it or just make it visible. You also need to position it. Look into getting page size etc and do a little math
[19:40:54] <Ratatat> cypha:  you know of modal for jquery?
[19:41:00] <cypha> Ratatat: no sir
[19:41:17] <Ratatat> look it up man, it'll cover prolly what you want
[19:41:25] <cypha> I'm just getting into jquery, I thought this would be a simple thing that will help me understand how jquery works
[19:41:53] <Ratatat> well it can be simple, but it can be more too. Code it yourself to start with
[19:42:23] <austinbv> miketaylr: https://gist.github.com/1117493
[19:44:07] <miketaylr> austinbv: in line 11 you're passing in the global `this` (aka window), right?
[19:44:48] <miketaylr> any reason you're not using traditional plugin methods here?
[19:45:21] <austinbv> yes
[19:56:57] <WarDekar> hey, trying to do something pretty simple (I think) but new to jquery- I want to match all tags that have a certain class, so I do $().hasClass('myClass'), then I want to remove that class
[19:57:27] <WarDekar> so I was trying to do: if($().hasClass('myClass')) { $(this).removeClass('myClass'); } but that doesn't seem to be working
[19:57:28] <saddishwasher> WarDekar: just do $('.myClass')
[19:57:40] <saddishwasher> ok
[19:57:56] <saddishwasher> WarDekar: do $('.myClass').removeClass()
[19:58:24] <WarDekar> ah that makes sense, I'm an idiot :(
[19:58:40] <andrewjackson> using jquery ui, I want to use the resizable interaction to resize a table
[19:59:16] <andrewjackson> am I gonna need a plugin for that?
[19:59:19] <WarDekar> another question, i have a table that I want to be able to let the user re-order the columns
[19:59:28] <WarDekar> i found dragtable.js out there, but the problem is, my headers span multiple columns
[19:59:48] <WarDekar> which makes dragtable.js not work properly, it also appears to not have been updated recently... are there any better add-ons out there?
[20:00:12] <saddishwasher> WarDekar: idk sorry
[20:00:25] <WarDekar> saddishwasher: k, ty with the class info though
[20:00:33] <jimubao> is there a channel for mooltools
[20:00:34] <jimubao> ?
[20:00:38] <jimubao> mootools ?
[20:01:08] <andrewjackson> that will work with sortable, I'm sure
[20:01:28] <saddishwasher> jimubao: did you try #mootools?
[20:01:45] <WarDekar> andrewjackson: the drag and drop will?
[20:01:58] <andrewjackson> no, use sortable
[20:02:04] <jimubao> saddishwasher: thanks
[20:02:04] <WarDekar> i'll have to check that out i guess, I odn't want to be able to do any sorting though so I didn't pay much attention to it
[20:02:06] <andrewjackson> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[20:02:22] <andrewjackson> read the options
[20:02:43] <saddishwasher> ?sortable @wardekar
[20:02:44] <bot-t> wardekar, UI/API/1.8/Sortable - The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortable
[20:02:49] <WarDekar> yeah taking a look at it now, ty
[20:03:53] <saddishwasher> basic irc question - can't find in my UI where to change the nick completion suffix, is there an irc command to change this?
[20:04:53] <andrewjackson> so I have this table... three cells... I want to make the middle cell the handle, and resize the left and right cell in syncronous...
[20:05:13] <andrewjackson> only problem is that "alsoResize" is completely useless for this.
[20:05:21] <Paganini> yawwwnnn God it's 4:05am and I'm exhauuuusted from proggin :/
[20:05:33] <andrewjackson> why would there be an option to resize two elements exactly the same??
[20:05:46] <sasori> is .validate() a built-in jquery function ?
[20:05:50] <andrewjackson> why not make an option to make one grow while the other shrinks??
[20:06:18] <andrewjackson> if I wanted two elements to grow together, I would contain them in the same element. >.<
[20:06:45] <saddishwasher> andrewjackson: the option to make two elements resize exactly the same is useful if you only want to bind the resize() function on 1 element but also want other elements on the page to resize....
[20:07:30] <andrewjackson> okay that's fine, but the forgot the option to make one element shrink while another grows... to act as a splitter
[20:07:51] <jimubao> is there anyone familiar with mootools
[20:07:51] <andrewjackson> I think I'm gonna have to roll my own on this one. =[
[20:07:52] <jimubao> http://pastie.org/private/lsvulbrdnxklncbsvsjjw
[20:08:05] <andrewjackson> nah dude... cows stink
[20:08:05] <jimubao> mootools channel soo quiet
[20:08:25] <saddishwasher> andrewjackson: sorry buddy, haven't used resize very much
[20:08:44] <andrewjackson> that's okay... maybe the next version eh?
[20:08:48] <saddishwasher> jimubao: you do know there is a big difference between mootools and jquery right?
[20:09:10] <andrewjackson> I've read and read and read, the feature is just not there
[20:09:29] <jimubao> saddishwasher: yeah i do requested help from mootools channel, but soo dead in there ~
[20:09:32] <jimubao> XD
[20:09:40] <andrewjackson> mootools is kinda slow I hear
[20:10:11] <saddishwasher> andrewjackson: the channel or the framework?
[20:10:17] <andrewjackson> the framework
[20:10:19] <andrewjackson> well...
[20:10:22] <andrewjackson> not slow, but slower
[20:10:25] <jimubao> both i guess
[20:10:42] <saddishwasher> I've heard the same thing, but mootools has its uses
[20:11:02] <andrewjackson> there's some online benchmark tool
[20:11:09] <andrewjackson> it types 5 different frameworks
[20:11:13] <jimubao> http://pastie.org/private/lsvulbrdnxklncbsvsjjw <---- can anyone help me with this though @@
[20:11:25] <saddishwasher> ?weather saddishwasher
[20:11:26] <andrewjackson> jquery and prototype are pretty much neck in neck for the lead
[20:11:27] <bot-t> saddishwasher, Texas - Time: 22:11 Sunday (CDT), Weather: Clear, 32C / 90F
[20:11:47] <saddishwasher> lying bastard

[20:12:22] <andrewjackson> lol
[20:13:23] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/giDRLtU1
[20:13:28] <andrewjackson> had a freak thunderstorm here in california for just about an hour this morning
[20:13:29] <Sean-Der> Can I please have some help?
[20:13:39] <andrewjackson> then it cleared up, and was hot again like usual
[20:13:42] <Sean-Der> How do I format my .text to get the option value
[20:14:31] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: answer me this, out of a select box...how many options can be selected at 1 time?
[20:14:49] <Sean-Der> Should be 1?
[20:15:21] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: correct, so a .each() statement is created an unnecessary loop in order to iterate through 1 result right?
[20:16:07] <saddishwasher> you can do with 1 line: var str = $('option:selected', this).text();
[20:16:07] <andrewjackson> have your seen this sean? http://api.jquery.com/text/
[20:16:19] <Sean-Der> saddiwasher: Oops
[20:16:26] <andrewjackson> oh nm... I misunderstood lol
[20:16:44] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: you can use 'this' in your selector because you are already inside the handler for .phone1 select box
[20:16:50] <matt__> pbxphreak?
[20:17:20] <saddishwasher> matt__: is that a person?
[20:17:24] <Sean-Der> the selector for which though?
[20:17:53] <saddishwasher> $('option:selected', this) is the same as $('.phone1 option:selected')
[20:17:55] <madprops> anybody knows a lightbox plugin that simply shows an image, with a nice dark overlay around it, and shows anything, no text or button, just a click to close it?
[20:18:23] <matt__> saddishwasher lol yes
[20:18:33] <matt__> circa 1992 irc...
[20:18:36] <saddishwasher> .seen pbxphreaks
[20:18:36] <hsbot> saddishwasher: I have never seen pbxphreaks.
[20:18:39] <andrewjackson> might as well do something like $(this.selected)
[20:18:47] <saddishwasher> .seen pbxphreak
[20:18:47] <hsbot> saddishwasher: I have never seen pbxphreak.
[20:18:51] <andrewjackson> I forgot how to write that tho
[20:18:56] <matt__> someone said he was on here during the day
[20:19:06] <saddishwasher> matt__: doesn't look like it
[20:19:11] <saddishwasher> did you get the nick wrong?
[20:19:14] <Sean-Der> Ok that cleans up a lot of unneccesary code
[20:19:27] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: :)
[20:19:33] <matt__> no  it's ok  thanks.
[20:19:36] <Sean-Der> Thank you!
[20:20:14] <Sean-Der> Can I have some help with the .text fuction?
[20:20:50] <Sean-Der> It is displaying which ever str has the option=selected correct?
[20:20:54] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: so now your statement should be this: http://pastebin.com/nLa0G4WG
[20:21:09] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: within the .phone1 select box
[20:22:03] <andrewjackson> I'm just gonna take a guess at this: $("div").text($("option:sleceted").text());
[20:22:08] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: notice, I also removed the last .change() at the close, you don't need this twice, you've already told it what to do on change...you don't need to tell it to change on top of that...it already knows
[20:22:37] <Sean-Der> And it fixes the issue with getting a default output on load!
[20:22:51] <saddishwasher> andrewjackson: that would work too, I wanted to show him how to write it with variable definition though...alittle less confusing right off the bat
[20:23:03] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: wahoo!
[20:23:16] <andrewjackson> oh, I just noticed to provided some coode
[20:23:19] <andrewjackson> my bad lol
[20:24:03] <Sean-Der> saddiwasher: Is there anyway I could get the value="18"? .text Works with displayed text only correct?
[20:24:08] <oojacoboo> is easeOutQuint part of the JQuery API?
[20:24:38] <gnarf> oojacoboo: its included in the ui effects core
[20:24:45] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: correct, .text() will get 'hello' out of <option value=1>hello</option>
[20:24:52] <gnarf> but i don't believe its embedded in core
[20:24:54] <saddishwasher> to get the value change .text to .val()
[20:25:04] <andrewjackson> .text means <div><b>asdasd</b></div> anything in the div, but displayed as text rather than rendered html
[20:25:05] <oojacoboo> gnarl, any idea where I can get more details on it?  Are there any variables that can be passed, like sensitivity?
[20:25:18] <oojacoboo> gnarf*
[20:25:18] <Sean-Der> Ok thank you I will go looking in the API for .val
[20:25:39] <andrewjackson> you could even use .html if you want it to be rendered as html
[20:25:42] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: no need to go looking see .val()
[20:25:51] <saddishwasher> ?val @ Sean-Der
[20:25:51] <bot-t> Sean-Der, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[20:26:11] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: bot-t is your friend :)
[20:26:21] <andrewjackson> nice
[20:26:23] <saddishwasher> bot-t are you my friend?
[20:26:28] <gnarf> oojacoboo: nope, write your own easing func
[20:26:29] <Sean-Der> saddiswasher: Thank you for all your help
[20:26:35] <saddishwasher> Sean-Der: no problem
[20:26:36] <gnarf> oojacoboo: look at the source for effects core
[20:26:48] <saddishwasher> bot-t: are you my friend?
[20:26:48] <bot-t> saddishwasher, Better not tell you now.
[20:26:50] <gnarf> there are some links to other versions of the easings

[20:44:51] * saddishwasher sees a tumble weed roll through #jquery 
[20:47:12] <pavan> Hi
[20:47:17] <pavan> good evening
[20:47:40] <RubyTN> I have a global array that is created onclick using jquery.map().  This function stores the id's of the divs that are not hidden.  How can I iterate through this global array to show those same div id's when the page is reloaded?  here is the jsfiddle of the first portion:  http://jsfiddle.net/MWZss/95/
[20:47:42] <pavan> I am looking for wiki editor for some of my pages in my site - are there any jquery plugins
[20:48:08] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  any ideas?
[20:48:57] <madprops> can I use $(this) inside a function(){} ?
[20:49:08] <imsky> madprops: yes
[20:49:19] <imsky> ?.each
[20:49:20] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[20:49:25] <imsky> ^ RubyTN
[20:50:14] <saddishwasher> imsky+1, RubyTN, but how do you plan on getting your reloaded page to see this global variable?
[20:50:49] <abjorn> imskay
[20:50:58] <abjorn> sorry i was playing LoL
[20:51:36] <imsky> lol
[20:51:44] <imsky> soup mane
[20:51:48] <pavan> anyone?
[20:51:56] <imsky> pavan: no
[20:51:58] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  here is the updated fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/MWZss/96/
[20:51:59] <abjorn> suddenly all my friends playing LoL so now im all into it
[20:52:12] <pavan> I am looking for wiki editor for some of my pages in my site - are there any jquery plugins
[20:52:18] <imsky> abjorn: what about tf2?
[20:52:22] <abjorn> @imsky: hostgator got a new HTML/CSS dev job open that I applied for c:
[20:52:27] <abjorn> psh no one plays that anymore
[20:52:32] <madprops> can I assign an onClick event to an image?
[20:52:32] <abjorn> now that its...you know...free...
[20:52:45] <imsky> hmm
[20:52:46] <saddishwasher> RubyTN: you haven't answered my question....
[20:52:55] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  I am using ujs to update the page contents, so the window.total value stays valid in all my pages
[20:53:18] <imsky> abjorn: http://tf2stats.net/servers/
[20:53:29] <imsky> 80k players ain't nobody
[20:53:32] <abjorn> our internal tools at hostgator are largely web based and mostly suck so hopefully they'll let me un-suck it
[20:53:44] <saddishwasher> RubyTN: ok, well, then I guess you're all set
[20:53:46] <abjorn> lol i know i just mean most of my friends dont play it so much anymore
[20:53:51] <imsky> elitists
[20:54:01] <abjorn> nah just autistic and add
[20:54:02] <imsky> takes like 5 bucks to go from f2p to ::PREMIUM::
[20:54:07] <abjorn> lol
[20:54:13] <imsky> instant respect
[20:54:22] <abjorn> I bought TF2 ages ago
[20:54:32] <imsky> shiii brah
[20:54:37] <abjorn> well, orange box
[20:54:40] <abjorn> but yeah
[20:54:50] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  I can then alert(total); in the prroper page.  I just can't figure out how to use .each to iterate through the array of id's to show the divs that exist in the array.  Any examples on how to do this?
[20:55:04] <abjorn> shit, reminds me, like half my game catalogue on steam i havent even finished yet
[20:55:08] <imsky> whenever you get bored of this guy: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/merchWeb3.png?1296084925 , let me know
[20:55:09] <abjorn> a lot of games i havent even played lol
[20:55:17] <abjorn> rofl
[20:55:18] <abjorn> BUT HES SO COOL
[20:55:29] <saddishwasher> RubyTN: total.each(function(i,e){ console.log( e ); });
[20:55:35] <imsky> i know, what a pimp
[20:55:48] <abjorn> im trying to learn how to play kat right now, its a bitch to get used to
[20:55:53] <imsky> what's kat?
[20:55:55] <imsky> is it...fastkat?
[20:55:55] <abjorn> im used to like straight up, just attack the fuckers
[20:55:59] <abjorn> oh, katarina
[20:56:12] <imsky> i'm talking about this: http://www.omiod.com/games/fastkat.php
[20:56:48] <RubyTN> I can already alert it on the page, so I know it's there.  I am only reloading a container div, not the entire page
[20:56:56] <abjorn> http://wfiles.brothersoft.com/l/league-of-legends-katarina_83543-1600x1200.jpg im talking about this
[20:57:04] <abjorn> shes a champion in LoL
[20:57:09] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  I can already alert it on the page, so I know it's there.  I am only reloading a container div, not the entire page
[20:57:40] <abjorn> Im used to playing chars that I can just charge an enemy, rather than a gank/assassin like kat
[20:57:47] <imsky> damn all this new terminology
[20:58:00] <abjorn> lol
[20:58:01] <saddishwasher> RubyTN: I think .map puts the entire div in an array so you can reference it with 'e' in this case
[20:58:26] <saddishwasher> RubyTN: so total.each(function(i,e){ e.attr('id'); });
[20:58:40] <imsky> abjorn: how's that work?
[20:59:17] <abjorn> hows what work
[20:59:32] <imsky> oh are you unemployed again
[21:00:02] <imsky> aka funemployed lolol
[21:00:08] <abjorn> oh
[21:00:08] <abjorn> OH
[21:00:13] <abjorn> i misunderstood
[21:00:14] <abjorn> work is baller
[21:00:24] <abjorn> sometimes...
[21:01:04] <imsky> lol all right
[21:01:11] <imsky> drifted off there
[21:01:16] <saddishwasher> RubyTN: understand?
[21:01:24] <abjorn> getting troll support chats is fun
[21:01:54] <imsky> you ever use an orm library for php?
[21:02:00] <abjorn> nope
[21:02:04] <imsky> damn
[21:02:07] <abjorn> I hardly use php
[21:02:10] <abjorn> not really a fan
[21:03:10] <imsky> what does your site run on?
[21:03:19] <abjorn> Wordpress!
[21:03:23] <imsky> awwww yeah
[21:03:25] <abjorn> I don't have to touch the code :D
[21:03:28] <imsky> lol
[21:03:39] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  kinda, looking at the code right now
[21:03:51] <abjorn> Personally, I like django
[21:04:03] <abjorn> Well, I like toying around with node more, but it's not fit for production really
[21:04:04] <imsky> i tried django
[21:04:37] <abjorn> django is kinda fun
[21:04:54] <abjorn> rails is neato but idk i could never get into ruby, although i think its a pretty nice language
[21:04:55] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  here is a gist of my code related to this issue:  https://gist.github.com/1117556
[21:05:09] <imsky> go play a round of fastkat
[21:05:14] <imsky> ie9 is really smooth wit it
[21:05:20] <saddishwasher> RubyTN: ok, first I made a mistake, it is $.each(total, function(i,e){ ... })
[21:05:30] <abjorn> lol im watching some shit on netflix atm
[21:06:41] <imsky> nice
[21:06:57] <abjorn> some silly animu
[21:07:03] <abjorn> I've exhausted everything else on netflix
[21:07:13] <imsky> have you exhausted all of futurama?
[21:07:38] <abjorn> I've seen every futurama like 094304598345038475804756398475634987563948756348756 times
[21:07:50] <imsky> good lord
[21:07:53] <saddishwasher> abjorn: is that lot?
[21:07:57] <saddishwasher> a lot*
[21:07:58] <abjorn> not really
[21:08:12] <imsky> lol netflix power user
[21:08:15] <saddishwasher> since the leading number is '0' I would say it is not
[21:08:17] <imsky> i cancelled my account ages ago
[21:08:54] <abjorn> the leading 0 is insignificant :D
[21:09:06] <imsky> base-8
[21:09:21] <saddishwasher> lol
[21:10:04] <imsky> figured out a way to play fastkat and chat at the same time
[21:10:12] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  do I need to remove the .join() from the end of my my .map function, so that it is actually an array?
[21:10:21] <RubyTN> and not a string
[21:10:58] <saddishwasher> RubyTN:yes, and remove the .get()
[21:11:35] <saddishwasher> then inside the $.each(total, function(i,e){ ... }); do an alert( e ); and see what you get
[21:11:38] <abjorn> I'm watching some silly "horror" anime about a site where you type in the name of someone you want to take revenge on and some hell girl takes em to hell. Basically every episode is
[21:11:38] <abjorn> 1) Someone is a huge dick and pushes someone over the edge
[21:11:38] <abjorn> 2) He/she hears about the website and types in the name
[21:11:38] <abjorn> 3) He/she tries to decide whether to actually do it or not
[21:11:38] <abjorn> 4) The "enemy" does a huge dick move and then the protaganist does it
[21:11:43] <abjorn> woah spam
[21:11:54] <saddishwasher> no joke
[21:12:01] <abjorn> wrong window, FORGIVE ME
[21:12:01] <saddishwasher> ?troll
[21:12:02] <imsky> sounds like dragonballz
[21:12:02] <bot-t> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1261442/troll.swf
[21:12:17] <imsky> step 3 is like every episode
[21:12:23] <imsky> which is why i don't watch anime
[21:12:30] <abjorn> lol
[21:13:11] <abjorn> this is actually a departure from most, because its not all "WHOOOO SUPA POWAS, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE US ALL. YOU MUST FIND SOME HIDDEN STRENGTH TO BEAT THE GUY WHO IS STRONGER THAN YOU, ONLY TO GO ON AND FIGHT A STRONGER GUY THAT YOU GOTTA FIND MORE STRENGTH TO BEAT, ETC"
[21:13:30] <abjorn> Because that's like 90% of anime
[21:13:31] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  I get [object Object] when I remove those things and alert
[21:13:39] <imsky> that's some recursive english right there
[21:13:40] <RubyTN> is that good or bad?
[21:13:48] <abjorn> The best kind of english
[21:13:58] <Ratatat> Anyone know how to make a .change for a text input that's live as you type?
[21:14:08] <saddishwasher> RubyTN: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/MWZss/97/
[21:14:08] <imsky> yeah, it's called .keyup
[21:14:10] <abjorn> all that means is you're alert'ing an object
[21:14:19] <abjorn> ^
[21:14:27] <abjorn> I can be on topic when i want to be
[21:14:30] <Ratatat> imsky: k, cheers
[21:14:31] <ldexterldesign> sup doods. got a small problem... i have a hover tooltip (which is handled by css), however one of my tooltips has a form. it's a pain in the ass when the tooltip disappears half way through filling out the form, so i've put a click event on it. i'd like the tooltip to go away when anything else on the page is clicked: http://pastebin.com/BPL0LFQ3
[21:14:39] <imsky> yw ratatat
[21:15:00] <ldexterldesign> basically need to fire the clickoff() after the .active class is applied i reckon to achieve what i want?.. any help appreciated

[21:20:17] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  how can I had those specific divs, since the array values are the values of the id's on the page?
[21:21:28] <saddishwasher> RubyTN: yea, to be honest I didn't really look through your HTML. but now that I am, I'm wondering the same thing
[21:23:16] <Ratatat> TonyWanis: is this a hosting spam channel? What you got?
[21:23:22] <RubyTN> saddishwasher:  what is alerting is the id of the divs to be shown.  By default on page load, I am hiding all of the divs with the class of 'fliecontainer'
[21:23:29] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: What?
[21:23:42] <Ratatat> TonyWanis: what?
[21:23:52] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: You want hosting

[21:27:46] <RubyTN> saddishwasher, shouldn't I be able to just do something like $.each(total, function(i,e){ $("'#" + e + "'").show();});   ?
[21:27:57] <crab> "number cleaning"?
[21:28:30] <Ratatat> I need to clean leading 0's, any alpha in fields etc
[21:29:51] <RubyTN> saddishwasher: shouldn't I be able to just do something like $.each(total, function(i,e){ $("'#" + e + "'").show();});   ?
[21:30:21] <abjorn> TonyWanis: What?
[21:30:47] <TonyWanis> abjorn: You want hosting
[21:30:55] <TonyWanis> For a site?
[21:31:01] <abjorn> ...no why are you asking that here
[21:31:12] <mikeycgto> anyone aware of issues with jquery sort() in Safari?
[21:31:13] <TonyWanis> Idk I need people
[21:31:19] <abjorn> If I wanted hosting I'd use my employee discount at HostGator :P
[21:31:37] <mikeycgto> trying to randomize some elements and it works in every browser except safari
[21:31:49] <abjorn> safari is balls
[21:33:00] <TonyWanis> abjorn: You work there
[21:33:24] <abjorn> No I just get an employee discount for funsies lol
[21:33:33] <abjorn> yeah I do
[21:33:36] <TonyWanis> Lol
[21:35:30] <Ratatat> TonyWanis: you do svn and ssh?
[21:36:13] <RubyTN> is it possible to show multiple divs whose id's are contained inside a js array/object using a jquery each loop?
[21:36:24] <Ratatat> yep
[21:36:49] <RubyTN> I would obviously try to use the .show method
[21:37:05] <Ratatat> itterate and show
[21:37:58] <RubyTN> Ratatat:  I've tried this, but I get nothing  -
[21:37:59] <RubyTN> $.each(total, function(i,e){
[21:38:01] <RubyTN>     alert( "'#" + e + "'" );
[21:38:02] <RubyTN>     $("'#" + e + "'").show();
[21:38:04] <RubyTN> });
[21:38:19] <RubyTN> it alerts this first item in the array, but then does nothing else
[21:38:35] <RubyTN> any ideas?
[21:38:53] <Ratatat> maybe use a normal js loop insteach of the each?
[21:39:02] <Ratatat> *instead
[21:39:32] <crab> rubytn: why are you adding single quotes?
[21:39:58] <crab> $('#x') means #x gets fed to $(), not '#x'
[21:40:03] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: Yes I do
[21:40:17] <RubyTN> crab:  $('.target').show();
[21:40:32] <RubyTN> crab:  so should I just remove the ''s?
[21:40:35] <crab> yes
[21:41:18] <RubyTN> crab, you are awesome, thank you so much
[21:41:34] <RubyTN> crab: you are awesome, thank you so much
[21:41:36] <crab> or just $(myarray.map(function (x){return '#'+x}).join(',')).show() ;-)
[21:41:43] <crab> heh, you're welcome.
[21:41:54] <RubyTN> you saved my life
[21:43:30] <RubyTN> crab:  that works, but now my toggle is broken, and with no error msgs, any ideas why that would happen?
[21:44:11] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: ????
[21:44:52] <Ratatat> price
[21:46:40] <madprops> is there a way to fire a function when slimbox is closed?
[21:48:35] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: 10 dollars a month with CPanel ssh and way more
[21:48:54] <TonyWanis> I'm the cheapest
[21:48:55] <Ratatat> TonyWanis: Location, bandwidth stats.. etc
[21:49:04] <crab> RubyTN: what toggle?
[21:50:30] <TonyWanis> Washington dc 50 gb bandwidth
[21:50:30] <krz> $('input').click(function() { alert('foo'); }); will work if one clicks on the input element. the input element has the following text: "foo plus bar". i need this to work if one clicks on the input element, but only on the "plus" text. is such a thing possible?
[21:50:44] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: Washington dc 50 gb bandwidth
[21:51:35] <TonyWanis> But I could higher the bandwidth something's
[21:51:40] <TonyWanis> *sometimes
[21:51:53] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: Trust me its a good deal
[21:54:20] <krz> anyone?
[21:54:36] <Ratatat> TonyWanis: Why trust you? URL?
[21:56:00] <perverse> what kind of input element, krz?
[21:56:13] <krz> perverse: form, text field
[21:56:27] <perverse> not that it matters, the answer is likely going to be no unless you have static text that can't be changed... then you might be able to try an absolutely positioned overlay or something tricky i guess
[21:57:06] <krz> perverse i just need the alert box to trigger if a user clicks on one of the words seperated by a space
[21:57:52] <perverse> i can't think of any way to "know" which word they've clicked on, off the top of my head
[21:58:04] <krz> take for example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/submit
[21:58:17] <krz> sorry http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask
[21:58:26] <krz> the tags input box
[21:58:41] <krz> how is the autocomplete being triggered?
[21:58:59] <krz> all the tags are put into one input text field, separated by a 'space'
[22:00:15] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: I have proof
[22:00:43] <perverse> looks to just be some sort of onkeyup sorting algorithm or something... probably client side even
[22:00:45] <ddoom> is it possible to get the URL from .ajaxStart()?
[22:01:54] <krz> perverse: IT IS client side
[22:02:56] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: Pm someone called Vintage I host his site
[22:04:12] <TonyWanis> Ratatat: ????
[22:06:48] <madprops> shouldn't this make everything fit in the window? $(document).height($(window).height());
[22:10:06] <ddoom> anyone know how I can get the URL of ajax calls when they start?:
[22:23:54] <m0dmd> sup everyone.
[22:24:51] <austen> I *HEART* jQuery!!
[22:25:10] <TonyWanis> austen: You need hosting
[22:25:43] <austen> I do?
[22:26:03] <madprops> how can I resize the document to make it fit the window?
[22:26:08] <TonyWanis> austen: Yes lol I'm jkjk do you need hosting?
[22:26:21] <TonyWanis> m0dmd: You need hosting?
[22:26:31] <austen> Naw, I'm good. :) All paid up for the next year or two, me thinks...
[22:26:33] <m0dmd> rofl nah buddy i'm good
[22:27:11] <m0dmd> what is the event listener for page scrolling?
[22:27:18] <m0dmd> or better question.
[22:27:43] <m0dmd> Anyone know if there is a plugin for positioning fixed elements in containers
[22:28:10] <austen> What I need is a pumice stone... My feets is peeling like crazy! Who knew losing a shit ton of weight would do that??
[22:30:16] <ldexterldesign> hey guys, is anyone free for some 1-on-1 jquery help? i got a toggle bubble problem i think...
[22:30:31] <ldexterldesign> ... can pastebin/screencast if you like
[22:31:27] <TonyWanis> ldexterldesign: You need hosting ?
[22:32:06] <solidus-river> hey, I'm using ui widgets, and this person is using this.current = [key, value];
[22:32:13] <solidus-river> how do i reference that by key, i dont understand the syntax thier using
[22:32:23] <solidus-river> this.current[key]?
[22:32:33] <ldexterldesign> bot-t: how do you ban people up in this bitch?! :P
[22:32:34] <bot-t> ldexterldesign, Wednesday, 2011-05-18 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110518.log.html
[22:32:41] <austen> they're
[22:33:12] <ldexterldesign> austen: pummice stones are the shit. had mine out on the other day
[22:33:15] <ldexterldesign> only*
[22:33:27] <m0dmd> damn that didn't work out to well.
[22:33:38] <ldexterldesign> austen: best used after the shower/bath once your skin is soft
[22:33:54] <m0dmd> i tried using window.scroll ... to find out if the floating navigation box was hidden but ... obviously it's always visible
[22:34:27] <m0dmd> anyone know of a floating plugin that sticks to containers so it does not obscure or overlay content?
[22:34:35] <austen> I need to scrubbs the shit out of my feet. And I need to get a peel on my legs. Fukkn strange, I'd never thought I'd say that before, but I got some serious discoloration from awkward fat-tan days...
[22:35:16] <Thomas`-> is it possible to dynamically create an iframe with no src attribute and add content into it?
[22:35:19] <austen> WOOT! gym's are neat. :)
[22:35:24] <m0dmd> austen if i could offer jquery advice for your feet I would
[22:35:55] <austen> Aah, that's the spot! All you have to do is say "jQuery" and I get happy. :)
[22:37:25] <austen> It used to be that Javascript meant that I had to spend some quality time with the ugly stepchild, Internet Explorer... Things are so much better than they were in the 90's...
[22:37:26] <solidus-river> hm, anyone understand this syntax?
[22:37:27] * syntech is back after 6h 31m 48s
[22:37:43] <solidus-river>  this.current = ['persona', id];
[22:38:10] <solidus-river> is that something special or is he an idiot and i should jsut use this.options.persona = id
[22:38:21] <austen> Looks like a fucked-up version of a tuple.
[22:38:42] <solidus-river> yeah but he's trying to store multiple tuples, hes referencing it as a lookup table
[22:39:16] <austen> Isn't that a way to assign a key=>value pair to an associative array?
[22:39:51] <solidus-river> that would make sense, but i'm not clear how to reference it then
[22:40:10] <solidus-river> i've solved it by moving things into the options data but i'm curiouse
[22:40:30] <austen> I would think that it would be this['persona'] => id;
[22:40:53] <austen> Dunno though... I really do suck at javascript....
[22:41:43] <solidus-river> it will perhaps forever remain a mystery
[22:42:42] <solidus-river> btw, tip, don't talk about associative arrays and javascript, it makes people on irc go crazy about how javascript doesn't really have "associative arrays" or "arrays" and how everythings an object despite javascript having built in methods like... .isArray()
[22:42:55] <solidus-river> sorry for the side troll, blowing off steam from an incident in #javascript a while ago :P
[22:43:32] <hExDj> emotions run high on IRC, no matter what the topic
[22:43:37] <austen> lol. Yeah, I'm hiding out in here because I got in an argument about "C++ isn't OOP?" on the C++ channel. :) Seriously, people need to relax...
[22:44:27] <Ratatat> but soldius,  javascript doesn't really have "associative arrays"
[22:44:50] <austen> BA-dump. chump!
[22:45:11] <solidus-river> Ratatat: yep :P like c++ doesn't really have strings.. thier just bytes that happen to signify character encodings
[22:45:31] <Ratatat> touche ;)
[22:45:37] <austen> solidus-river: I know more about your nick than I did just a few days ago... :)
[22:45:57] <austen> Not sure what the -river part is about, but I reall ALL about solidus...
[22:47:33] * syntech is now away, sleep (log\on pager\on)
[22:48:00] <solidus-river> austen: metal gear games?
[22:48:16] <austen> Um... Guess not... :)
[22:48:50] <austen> I own nothing of hardware that is capable of playing games. Partly because I refuse to run Windows...
[22:48:52] <solidus-river> haha, probably confused i'm curiouse now
[22:49:08] <austen> Do you know what a solidus is?
[22:49:24] <Paganini> hahaha at the javascript array thingie, I mean it's good to 'have your facts right' but when it comes to that kinda troll, who gives a flying duck :)
[22:50:06] <austen> It is this: ⁄  not to be confused with this: / see? ⁄ /⁄ /⁄
[22:50:15] * syntech is back after 2m 42s
[22:50:24] <solidus-river> no actually, i thought it was something metal gear people made to be badass, was assuming it was latin derived something for solid matter
[22:50:30] <kenthree> mind blown
[22:50:31] <austen> ar, sheit... okay how do you do unichar in irc?
[22:50:31] <solidus-river> austen: whoa, thats pretty cool
[22:50:47] <austen> shaddyup... It is the fraction symbol. Steeper than the /
[22:51:10] <austen> Refers to solid gold coins minted in the Roman empire, hence the name "solidus."
[22:51:30] <austen> It is also where we get the name "soldier" because that is what one was paid to serve in the Roman army.
[22:52:52] <solidus-river> you scared off syntech so much he didnt tell us why he was leaving :P
[22:53:04] <austen> See what you learn when you get in arguments about whether {} are called "curly braces" or not? (NO, they are not.. They are just called "brackets", or many of other things but NOT curly braces.
[22:53:22] <solidus-river> lol, <3 irc
[22:54:40] <austen> THESE are brackets ()
[22:54:45] <austen> If you are a brit that is...
[22:54:48] <j_wright> but then so are (), [] and <>s
[22:55:07] <austen> () parens (US only) Brackets in UK.
[22:55:18] <austen> [] brackets, in US.
[22:55:23] <austen> <> angle brackets.
[22:55:28] <j_wright> square brackets
[22:57:19] <austen> There is another version of () as well, the () are called lunula, because they were curvy unlike the chevrons that they started out as.
[22:57:37] <austen> But my favorite punctuation mark is: #
[22:57:45] <austen> The octothorpe
[22:58:05] <j_wright> not the pound sign
[22:58:06] <j_wright> heh
[22:58:45] <j_wright> hashmark too
[22:59:01] <austen> However, '!' has an interesting origin as well, originally latin 'io', where the 'i' was on top of the 'o' which meant "joy" and also "OH MY FUKKNG GOD" in certain situations...
[22:59:37] <austen> octothorpe is way cooler sounding. And people look at you funny when you say it. Then you just shake your head and stare back like, "Duh, dude..."
[22:59:53] <j_wright> heh
[23:01:00] <austen> Okaaay... I need to run to the drugstore... Nothing like a late-night roll through the West LA valley...
[23:03:43] <solidus-river> whats special about jQuery Mobile?
[23:03:51] <solidus-river> just optimized for mobile browsers?
[23:05:15] <solidus-river> nevermind, read up on it
[23:06:10] <dragonshed> downloaded adobe's edge preview, looks like edge and edge.symbol are built on jquery
[23:06:40] <dtee> hi
[23:06:43] <dtee> anyway to parse url
[23:06:46] <dtee> to get params out?
[23:11:45] <solidus-river> dtee: wierd, i actually dont see any, but why would you be getting something from that, shouldn't htat be handled in php or some server side language?
[23:13:03] <j_wright> well something like #parm=b&parm2=c perhaps
[23:15:10] <j_wright> dtee: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/query-object perhaps?
[23:15:15] <solidus-river> dtee: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/09/get-url-parameters-values-with-jquery.html
[23:15:52] <solidus-river> dtee: j_wrights link is better
[23:23:23] <dtee> solidus-river, thanks!
[23:50:42] <aspect> jQuery.tmpl() returns a (set of) DOM elements.  Is there a parameter I can give it, or another thing I should use, to just get a string back?
