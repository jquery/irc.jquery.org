[00:00:11] <shoelessone> !
[00:00:18] <shoelessone> Ah, I don't know about that but if you say so!!
[00:00:34] <shoelessone> ah, placeholder
[00:00:41] <shoelessone> do you only care about modern browsers?
[00:01:18] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: i want cross browser support
[00:01:38] <shoelessone> too bad :(
[00:01:45] <shoelessone> still, this might be useful
[00:01:45] <shoelessone> http://jsfiddle.net/pY6rA/
[00:01:51] <shoelessone> i just used the html5 property
[00:01:54] <shoelessone> if you haven't heard of it
[00:01:59] <shoelessone> it does it all automatically, without any code
[00:02:06] <shoelessone> placeholder tag
[00:03:21] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: what browser support that? ie 7/8?
[00:03:42] <shoelessone> no :( - IE9, FF, Chrome, Safari, most mobile, etc
[00:03:47] <shoelessone> but not 6/7/8
[00:03:48] <nail_> there are plugins that make placeholders working for legacy brwosers
[00:03:56] <nail_> https://github.com/danielstocks/jQuery-Placeholder is one
[00:04:00] <shoelessone> true, and that might be your easiest solution
[00:04:07] <shoelessone> and best probably, no need to reinvent the wheel
[00:04:16] <shoelessone> but, if you want to do it yourself, ti's not so bad
[00:05:36] <nail_> if you want to do it yourself you should use blur/focus events instead of key* ones
[00:06:10] <DeManDinG> actually trickier than i thought it would be
[00:06:29] <Daniwan> Is there an easy way to tell .scrollTop to scroll to the bottom of a div?
[00:06:29] <shoelessone> http://jsfiddle.net/pY6rA/3/
[00:06:41] <shoelessone> that might work for you, sort of
[00:06:46] <shoelessone> my first example using the HTML5 option
[00:06:55] <shoelessone> second example does basically the same thing with simple jquery
[00:07:08] <shoelessone> you could just replace "#ok" with "textarea" if you wanted
[00:07:13] <shoelessone> although maybe I'm misunderstanding
[00:07:19] <shoelessone> Daniwan: sorry, I'm tired, what do you mean example?
[00:07:40] <Daniwan> Making a live chat.  The text view adds lines, want to keep the focus at the bottom
[00:07:52] <shoelessone> ah
[00:08:13] <shoelessone> not sure what the best way would be :(
[00:08:27] <shoelessone> seems like this might be a good time to use a fixed position though?
[00:08:41] <shoelessone> though iphone/ipod wouldn't support it
[00:09:02] <Daniwan> fixed position would have nothing to do with scrolling
[00:09:08] <shoelessone> you're right
[00:09:10] <shoelessone> sorry
[00:09:12] <Daniwan> If your talking css
[00:09:19] <shoelessone> I am, and you're right
[00:09:26] <navaru> I have a question regarding garbage collection http://jsfiddle.net/navaru/sj3s5/14/
[00:09:43] <Daniwan> I mean I get it, $("#mydiv").scrollTop(100);  scrolls down 100 pixels...
[00:10:06] <Daniwan> I mean maybe I could do that each thing to count the divs and calculate pixels from there?
[00:10:29] <Daniwan> like for each div found WITHIN the chat view scroll down x pixels
[00:10:43] <Daniwan> I was just assuming that their should be an easier way
[00:10:52] <shoelessone> navaru: wish I could help, I might be able to with a bit more sleep but honestly I'm too tired to think that hard right now :(
[00:11:41] <navaru> shoelessone: no worries, 10x anyhow ;)
[00:14:08] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: that was exactly what i wanted.
[00:14:14] <DeManDinG> shoelessone: thanks.
[00:14:15] <|RicharD|> how i can take a number in random between 2 numbers ?
[00:14:16] <Daniwan> would I call .each on the div then?  like $("#chatview").each("div", function() { scrollVal += 5; });
[00:14:23] <|RicharD|> Math.random or what else ?

[00:32:30] <blackspotwiggins> DeManDinG, literally the first google answer works
[00:32:44] <angelkoilov> DeManDinG: i've searched that too, only way i found is to get textarea as not jquery object ..... $('#textarea').get(0);
[00:33:18] <ServerSage> blackspotwiggins: But asking here 400 times in 3 minutes is easier than using google.
[00:33:44] <intelmeth> The jQuery.tmpl() method is designed for chaining with .appendTo, .prependTo, .insertAfter or .insertBefore as in the following example.
[00:34:08] <intelmeth> How do I get the rendered html?
[00:34:21] <intelmeth> as in, I don't want to chain it ..
[00:34:53] <coldhead> var html = $('#tmpl').tmpl({}).html()
[00:35:01] <coldhead> you DO want to chain it
[00:35:09] <coldhead> you just want to do a different thing with the chain
[00:36:04] <intelmeth> actually I dont want to chain it - trust me
[00:36:20] <intelmeth> just want the rendered HTML content - suprised there is no easy way to do that
[00:36:44] <intelmeth> i guess i could create an element,  appendTo it and then grab the innerHTML ... but
[00:37:10] <coldhead> var html = $('#tmpl').tmpl({}).wrap('<div></div>').parent().html()
[00:37:14] <intelmeth> oh - sry didnt see your The jQuery.tmpl() method is designed for chaining with .appendTo, .prependTo, .insertAfter or .insertBefore as in the following example.

[00:38:14] <Double_Rainbow> var start = "1/09/2011"; var end = "24/09/2011"
[00:38:34] <Double_Rainbow> how do i calculate all the dates from var start to var end?
[00:39:27] <coldhead> take a look at some docs for jquery's Date object
[00:39:33] <coldhead> and Date arithmetic
[00:39:38] <coldhead> you'll have to keep adding 1 day
[00:39:47] <Double_Rainbow> coldhead: indeed
[00:39:56] <coldhead> dates are hard
[00:39:58] <DeManDinG> http://jsfiddle.net/pY6rA/4/ <-- how to make cursor appear at start of textarea on focus?
[00:40:04] <jonee> hi! what is your preferred jquery plugin for creating charts?
[00:40:25] <blackspotwiggins> Double_Rainbow, all the dates or interval between those two?
[00:40:40] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: interval between theses two
[00:40:54] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: Seriously, google it and stop being lazy.  The very first link will work.
[00:40:58] <blackspotwiggins> you can parse both dates and subtract their timestamps to get the interval in ms
[00:41:08] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: wut?
[00:41:19] <blackspotwiggins> you know what unix timestamp is?
[00:41:24] <Double_Rainbow> nopes
[00:41:36] <blackspotwiggins> well
[00:41:40] <michael_mbp> hi al
[00:41:51] <blackspotwiggins> basically seconds/ms since 1. jan 1970
[00:42:01] <coldhead> jonee: i use and endorse flot
[00:42:02] <DeManDinG> ServerSage: No it will not work as I am looking for a jquery function to do this without using a plugin.
[00:42:03] <coldhead> flot and heroin
[00:42:07] <blackspotwiggins> almost all languages have a mechanism to convert a date to timestamp
[00:42:09] <michael_mbp> when I get a json response wrapped as ( {... ] ); my .ajax() method handles it fine
[00:42:18] <blackspotwiggins> and since you can do regular math on integers, it's easy to find the interval
[00:42:20] <jonee> thanks coldhead. how about jqplot?
[00:42:24] <michael_mbp> but if I get a json response without the (...); around it, it gives Err.
[00:42:50] <blackspotwiggins> jonee, highcharts is also an option
[00:42:53] <michael_mbp> do I need to add dataFilter and place the (); around it?
[00:43:06] <coldhead> i don't use or endorse that, jonee. but other people do!
[00:43:07] <jonee> i wonder which is the most popular
[00:43:08] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: I don't see where it uses a plugin.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/499126/jquery-set-cursor-position-in-text-area
[00:43:16] <coldhead> flot comes with its documentation in a TEXT FILE
[00:43:20] <coldhead> HARDCORE
[00:43:34] <blackspotwiggins> flot isnt very actively maintained
[00:43:36] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: Asking the same question over and over and over and over within a 10 minute span WILL NOT HELP.
[00:43:40] <blackspotwiggins> at least it wasnt when i last used it
[00:43:41] <Zerxer> I'm currently having to work with AnyChart for charting, but that's not jquery :(
[00:43:43] <michael_mbp> anyone?
[00:43:51] <jonee> i obviously would prefer the one easiest to learn coldhead
[00:44:08] <DeManDinG> ServerSage: if you happen to read the URL you are recommending to people then you should know that the function does not exist.
[00:44:21] <jonee> http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/top-jquery-chart-libraries-interactive-charts/
[00:44:27] <coldhead> jonee: there's not really much to learn: array of points, set a few options, voila
[00:44:39] <michael_mbp> hi coldhead
[00:44:41] <michael_mbp> any ideas mate?
[00:44:44] <coldhead> mostly you just wanna find an example that's almost want you want and pillage it
[00:44:54] <jonee> ok
[00:45:06] <michael_mbp> when I get a json response wrapped as ( {... ] ); my .ajax() method handles it fine
[00:45:07] <coldhead> ?g jsonlint @ michael_mbp
[00:45:08] <bot-t> michael_mbp, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[00:45:10] <coldhead> paste your stuff in there
[00:45:14] <coldhead> if it's valid then it's valid
[00:45:22] <coldhead> if not, you fix it until it's valid
[00:45:25] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: Speaking of reading, you should try it.  Read the answer, not the question.
[00:45:30] <coldhead> and when it's valid everything is going to be okay and good forever
[00:45:31] <michael_mbp> the json is valid
[00:45:38] <coldhead> is it jsonlint valid?
[00:45:52] <michael_mbp> if I yank the response off twitter the json is wrapped in ( );
[00:46:05] <michael_mbp> from a different site, the response is pure { }
[00:46:09] <DeManDinG> ServerSage: Stop being a pain. Read before you recommend URLs.
[00:46:19] <blackspotwiggins> michael_mbp, using jsonp?
[00:46:24] <michael_mbp> the issue is .ajax() goes error for the latter
[00:46:34] <michael_mbp> wasn't intending to
[00:46:51] <michael_mbp> http://mdbitz.com/testing/PHPYahooFinance/finance.php?symbol=DELL&amp;callback=?
[00:47:04] <michael_mbp> that's regular json afaik
[00:47:09] <michael_mbp> unpadded.
[00:47:25] <Zerxer> DeManDinG: seriously? there's answers posted on the page with code that does what you want. the one directly under "Update" being made into a jquery function. maybe ServerSage and I are completely lost
[00:47:30] <blackspotwiggins> callback means its jsonp
[00:47:34] <coldhead> you can actually use jsonlint to find out if some json is actually valid
[00:47:35] <blackspotwiggins> you need to pass the function name to it
[00:47:40] <coldhead> i don't know if anyone mentioned that
[00:47:44] <blackspotwiggins> so the response is functionname(jsonhere)
[00:47:45] <coldhead> but that's what i'm lead to believe
[00:47:45] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: I did read it.  No where in the answer does it say the functions he uses A) required a plugin, or B) don't exist.
[00:48:01] <blackspotwiggins> as your callback is empty, it comes back as (jsonhere);
[00:48:08] <DeManDinG> ServerSage: There is no jQuery function called setCursorPosition(); its a custom function, and so are the other examples are based on custom functions.
[00:48:10] <michael_mbp> ahh
[00:48:23] <blackspotwiggins> DeManDinG, so what? it solves the issue doesnt it?
[00:48:43] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: Wow, READ THE PAGE.  Not the first two paragraphs.  Christ.
[00:49:18] <michael_mbp> blackspotwiggins: http://jsfiddle.net/hqkHK/1/
[00:49:28] <michael_mbp> I added the callback name but still Err
[00:49:28] <coldhead> i think we might have to start voting people off the island
[00:49:33] <ServerSage> lol
[00:49:42] <michael_mbp> interestingly the twitter feed (no callback specified) works fine.
[00:49:46] <ServerSage> I am the weakest link, good bye.
[00:49:52] <blackspotwiggins> michael_mbp, it gets eaten by sop
[00:50:00] <DeManDinG> ServerSage: Bye Troll
[00:50:00] <michael_mbp> sop?
[00:50:27] <blackspotwiggins> michael_mbp, wtf is j-son?
[00:50:34] <Zerxer> DeManDinG: you're the troll. http://jsfiddle.net/pY6rA/6/
[00:50:56] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: Really?  Answering your question makes me a troll?  Tell you what, open that link I gave you.  Scroll down until you see a BIG DAMN NUMBER 42.  There is your answer.
[00:51:07] <michael_mbp> found that in some StackOver flow fix
[00:51:21] <blackspotwiggins> and you just blindly copy stuff?
[00:51:25] <blackspotwiggins> dont do that
[00:51:26] <michael_mbp> it works in a different fiddle I did http://jsfiddle.net/xV69H/
[00:51:28] <michael_mbp> ok
[00:51:34] <blackspotwiggins> seems like jsfiddle has ded
[00:51:47] <blackspotwiggins> michael_mbp, http://jsfiddle.net/hqkHK/2/
[00:51:55] <Zerxer> ServerSage: how true. the answer to life, the universe, and everything, including his question, is 42
[00:52:00] <DeManDinG> ServerSage: You don't listen to well. I am after a jQuery function to do it. I repeat not a custom function. What a pain you are.
[00:52:03] <Zerxer> though I used the code posted in the question's update
[00:52:15] <Zerxer> DeManDinG: CLICK MY LINK PLZZZZZZZZZ
[00:52:19] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: People like you make my balls ache.
[00:52:26] <Zerxer> guess where I got that code from, too
[00:52:31] <michael_mbp> thanks...looks like it's dying heh
[00:52:48] <DeManDinG> Zerxer: your code doesn't work!
[00:52:49] <blackspotwiggins> DeManDinG, wtf do you mean jquery function. wrap it in whatever the fuck you want. it works. its there. take it or leave it
[00:52:54] <Zerxer> works for me
[00:53:08] <ServerSage> Zerxer: Hehe.
[00:53:10] <blackspotwiggins> if it doesnt have $ in it, you cant use it?
[00:53:14] <blackspotwiggins> get real
[00:53:20] <dr0id> really?
[00:53:44] <Zerxer> the question itself at the top of the page ServerSage linked has an update in it with code that turned the answer into a jquery wrapped function
[00:54:23] <Zerxer> if jsfiddle weren't going so slow I'd test it in more than just chrome
[00:54:25] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: What you want and what you get aren't always ==.  Work with what's available and stop being a douche.
[00:54:41] <michael_mbp> blackspotwiggins: why jsonp?
[00:55:04] <ServerSage> Zerxer: So jsfiddle is slow for everybody, not just me.  Good to know.  I was ready to put the internet to bed.
[00:55:10] <blackspotwiggins> michael_mbp, because it's crossdomain
[00:55:15] <blackspotwiggins> and you cant do that without jsonp
[00:55:26] <michael_mbp> ah.
[00:55:42] <michael_mbp> twitter feed worked fine, with just json
[00:55:46] <DeManDinG> ServerSage: go back to school, and do not collect $200.
[00:55:52] <michael_mbp> ?
[00:56:03] <ServerSage> I'm not even sure what that means.
[00:56:10] * DeManDinG is away
[00:56:31] <Zerxer> http://sitexero.net/42.html
[00:56:41] <blackspotwiggins> wow, #jquery keeps surpassing itself every day
[00:56:45] <Zerxer> this works fine for me in chrome/firefox. keydown, puts pos at the start
[00:57:25] <Zerxer> I had to steal the jsfiddle source due to it being dead :(
[00:57:35] <ServerSage> blackspotwiggins: Yeah, reminds me why I don't frequent IRC any more.
[00:57:37] <DeManDinG> Zerxer: not in IE it doesn't.
[00:57:53] <Zerxer> DeManDinG: does in ie9
[00:58:08] <Zerxer> you should specify exactly what browser you're testing in
[00:58:13] <DeManDinG> Zerxer: not in IE6/7/8 pff
[00:58:37] <Zerxer> works in IE8
[00:58:45] <Zerxer> works in IE7
[00:58:49] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: What is it you want from the people in #jquery?  Would you like us to get together and write a 100% cross browser perfect solution just for you?
[00:58:52] <Zerxer> works in IE6
[00:58:59] <Zerxer> with tests in IETester, at least
[00:59:04] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: Verified, works in IE7.
[00:59:04] <michael_mbp> blackspotwiggins: can you explain how the callback=? specifier works please
[00:59:12] <michael_mbp> I just googled and didn't come up with much
[00:59:24] <DeManDinG> ServerSage: dude why don't you take your attitude elsewhere. i'm done talking to you, so stop irritating me.
[00:59:25] <michael_mbp> well since, the specifier is in the response url.
[00:59:46] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: Nah, you raised my blood pressure.  You're on my irritate list.
[00:59:51] <Zerxer> DeManDinG: my testing says it works in IE
[01:00:07] * DeManDinG ServerSage now on my ignore list
[01:00:19] <Zerxer> works in opera/safari too
[01:00:22] <Zerxer> seems pretty cross-browser for me
[01:00:27] <DeManDinG> Zerxer: well not your fiddle in IE8

[01:01:13] <blackspotwiggins> michael_mbp, https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/JSONP pretty muuch sums it up
[01:01:18] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: The fiddle works fine in IE7.
[01:01:33] <ServerSage> Well, that is when the damn page loads.
[01:01:40] <michael_mbp> where can I get info on how the callback stuff works?
[01:01:47] <DeManDinG> Zerxer: that link also doesn't move cursor to start in textarea in IE8
[01:02:48] <Zerxer> does anyone else here have an actual copy of IE8 installed? cause I only have IETester
[01:03:05] <ServerSage> Zerxer: I might on one of my VMs.  Hang on.
[01:03:20] <LOLFormat> I only have IE6
[01:03:22] <Zerxer> DeManDinG: are you keying down or just clicking inside of it?
[01:03:30] <michael_mbp> oh the call back name is appended to the response
[01:03:39] <Zerxer> if you're serious LOLFormat, then let's find out if it works in IE6
[01:03:43] <Zerxer> cause if it does, no reason IE8 should break
[01:03:49] <LOLFormat> ok
[01:03:49] <blackspotwiggins> wow, im amazed that you guys are really still helping him
[01:03:55] <Zerxer> LOLFormat http://sitexero.net/42.html
[01:03:56] <DeManDinG> Zerxer: i key down, click up, down, left right... no
[01:04:15] <Zerxer> blackspotwiggins: more like hoping to prove to him that ServerSage gave him the answer at the very start
[01:04:20] <michael_mbp> aha I see the confusion
[01:04:22] <Zerxer> because then he should feel like a terrible terrible man
[01:04:25] <LOLFormat> Hmm, it doesn't let me write. takes cursor to initial position ?
[01:04:27] <blackspotwiggins> he wont anyway
[01:04:37] <ServerSage> Zerxer: DeManDinG I just tried it in IE8 and it works fine.
[01:04:37] <Zerxer> LOLFormat, yeah. should move cursor to the start
[01:04:40] <michael_mbp> that Stock quotes script doesn't parse the callback anywyas
[01:04:45] <LOLFormat> yes, and what's the point ?
[01:04:54] <Zerxer> he wanted code that would move the cursor to the start
[01:04:55] <Zerxer> there he goes
[01:04:58] <LOLFormat> don't create un-usable apps
[01:05:03] <ServerSage> blackspotwiggins: Some of us are gluttons for punishment.
[01:05:09] <Zerxer> well he wants it to do it on focus
[01:05:12] <Zerxer> mine is just a dumb example ;)
[01:05:16] <blackspotwiggins> ServerSage, tell me about it..
[01:05:31] <LOLFormat> why you have //<![CDATA[ ?
[01:05:32] <DeManDinG> Zerxer: your code doesn't work.
[01:05:36] <LOLFormat> sorry, nvm
[01:05:51] <Zerxer> LOLFormat claims it works on IE6
[01:05:53] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: There, it fucking works in IE6, IE7, IE8, IE9, Chrome, Safari, Firefox 4.
[01:06:00] <Zerxer> DeManDinG: your computer just doesn't work, I guess
[01:06:03] <michael_mbp> blackspotwiggins: so does the callback function get run automatically
[01:06:10] <blackspotwiggins> michael_mbp, yea
[01:06:10] <michael_mbp> ?
[01:06:12] <ServerSage> DeManDinG: I personally have tested IE7 and IE8, Chrome, Safari, and FF.
[01:06:13] <Zerxer> anyways, I helped you as far as I could. the code is in the source. that's all I or anyone else can do
[01:06:14] <Zerxer> ciao
[01:06:17] <blackspotwiggins> it works by injecting it as a script tag
[01:06:17] <cups> hey guys I have a quick question, can't find a quick answer ont he web.  If I bind a click event to two selectors, is there an easy way within the function to determine which element was clicked on?   $('#left, #right').click(function(){if left or if right})  ?
[01:06:21] <blackspotwiggins> it's not really ajax at all
[01:06:32] <michael_mbp> ah
[01:06:45] <ServerSage> cups: You could use the ID of the element I suppose.
[01:06:51] <michael_mbp> http://htmlcssjavascript.com/javascript/json-feeds-for-fun-and-profit-part-2-callbacks-with-twitter/  << that's about the best I found on the topic
[01:06:55] <ServerSage> cups: $(this).attr('id')
[01:07:03] <michael_mbp> recommend any awesome books covering advanced JQuery/ajax?
[01:07:58] <cups> serversage: yeah that's pretty simple, thank you
[01:08:18] <DeManDinG> Ciao To YOU!
[01:08:33] <ServerSage> cups: No problem.
[01:08:40] <blackspotwiggins> michael_mbp, your googlefu is very weak if you cant find anything about jsonp on ther interwebs
[01:08:55] <ServerSage> Did anybody else just do a little happy dance at their desk?
[01:08:57] <michael_mbp> wasn't searching for jsonp
[01:09:12] <michael_mbp> was searching json response callback
[01:09:20] <cups> serversage, if I call $(this).attr('id') am I doing another search in the dom?
[01:10:13] <cups> does the event object that gets passed with the click function include a value for the element that triggered it?
[01:10:40] <xp_prg> ok I am confused about something, I am trying to follow this: http://fancybox.net/howto
[01:11:14] <xp_prg> they have $("a.grouped_elements").fancybox();, I can make fancybox work if I do $.fancybox({content: "wow"});
[01:11:28] <xp_prg> but when I try $("a.grouped_elements").fancybox(); nothing happens
[01:11:31] <ServerSage> cups: I admit ignorance on both questions.  I'll have to defer to somebody else.  I've been out of the jquery game for a while.  I think I've forgotten more than I ever leavned.
[01:11:40] <xp_prg> how do I "troubleshoot" that?
[01:12:08] <xp_prg> I am a little bit new to jQuery, but I am having a hard time believeing I can't do this right as it is an example
[01:12:25] <James-_> hello
[01:12:29] <James-_> i need help
[01:12:33] <HBD> Hi, I need to put some input controls etc. inside an overlay. Something like a callout, which indicates the origin of the event. Any suggestions on how to go about it, or does a good plugin already exist to do this?
[01:12:36] <jsnmtth> I'm using the jquery AJAX routine to download additional content... my problem is that this new content has jquery interactions, and they don't work.  Is there a way to fix that?
[01:12:37] <cups> serversage:  ah, I found it, this is good... http://api.jquery.com/event.target/ (in case curious)
[01:12:41] <James-_> how can i change iframe src in js ?
[01:13:00] <James-_> i create a function click with alert('ok');
[01:13:07] <HBD> In other words, if I can put input controls inside a good tooltip, I should be fine. What's a recommended tooltip plugin?
[01:13:12] <James-_> i want same click this create src="mysrc"
[01:13:27] <blackspotwiggins> ?attr @ James-_
[01:13:28] <bot-t> James-_, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[01:13:56] <James-_> this work with iframe ?
[01:14:38] <jsnmtth> Typically what I have done is to re-run the jquery calls, but in this case I would be duplicating a LOT of code.
[01:15:43] <TrueColors> $(".textbox").change(...) this doesn't execute when I change the value of the textbox...?
[01:16:21] <phobia> Hi :) Any thoughts on how I can add things to jquery's "on window load queue" before jquery is loaded? This is an example where I encounter the problem http://pastebin.com/y8nUF7BH
[01:16:46] <xp_prg> this worked: alert(jQuery("a.grouped_elements").val()); but it returns undefined
[01:16:59] <xp_prg> I am confused why it would say undefined
[01:17:28] <quicksilver> xp_prg: <a> elements do not have values?
[01:18:04] <James-_> bot-t i try that $('#watf').attr("src") = "test";   and i get this error invalid assignment left-hand side
[01:18:20] <xp_prg> quicksilver I have the <a elements at the bottom on the page: http://fancybox.net/howto
[01:18:43] <quicksilver> xp_prg: .val() is for input elements, which have values.
[01:18:50] <quicksilver> xp_prg: <a> elements do not have values.
[01:18:51] <blackspotwiggins> ?iamabot @ James-_
[01:18:53] <bot-t> James-_, MJD-S Photography | MetaFilter Projects - http://projects.metafilter.com/2419/MJDS-Photography
[01:18:57] <blackspotwiggins> ugh, fail
[01:19:01] <quicksilver> that is why it says 'undefined'
[01:19:09] <blackspotwiggins> bot-t is a bot, no use talking to him
[01:19:11] <xp_prg> hmm... ok, nothing comes up in fancybox, no gallery of images, I am confused why that is
[01:19:38] <James-_> ok blackspotwiggins lol
[01:19:43] <James-_> so what the problem ?
[01:21:44] <blackspotwiggins> James-_, if you read the link i gave you
[01:21:58] <blackspotwiggins> you'll find that setting an attribute uses a slightly different syntax
[01:23:29] <HBD> What's a good tooltip plugin for jquery?
[01:24:33] <luite> I like qtip 2
[01:24:44] <luite> but some people might find it too bloaty
[01:25:31] <ServerSage> HBD: I use http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/
[01:25:57] <HBD> thank you ServerSage
[01:29:17] <Zerxer> ServerSage: look at you bouncing back, being all helpful to thankful people
[01:29:34] <ServerSage> Zerxer: I had to have a beer to calm me down first.  :)
[01:29:40] <blackspotwiggins> har
[01:29:52] <ServerSage> Being a troll is hard work.
[01:29:55] <Zerxer> now you need these people to donate beer money to you
[01:30:17] <ServerSage> Ha, not sure my wife would like that.
[01:30:17] <Zerxer> it's sad. IE is already terrible, but that guy's IE was even more broken than it should have been
[01:30:47] <ServerSage> Zerxer: Indeed.  And his broken record "Your code doesn't work" was really starting to raise my ire.
[01:33:00] <ServerSage> I think the only place more frustrating to assist folks is #perl.
[01:33:11] <aaronmcadam> ServerSage: pricks lookin for help again?
[01:33:24] <devinrolsen> lol
[01:33:31] <aaronmcadam> why perl?
[01:33:36] <ServerSage> aaronmcadam: Hehe, no just chatting about our last douche.
[01:33:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:33:55] <ServerSage> aaronmcadam: #perl just seems to bring in all the "I'm new, how do I declare a variable" kind of questions.
[01:34:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah nothing too wrong with that
[01:34:30] <aaronmcadam> and support on the net isn't as widespread for perl really
[01:34:38] <aaronmcadam> although I'm sure there's plenty of forums
[01:34:59] <aaronmcadam> there's no "Top 10 Perl plugins" posts
[01:35:11] <aaronmcadam> so how else can those idiots use a language :D
[01:35:20] <ServerSage> aaronmcadam: Maybe I'm old school, or just a bit jaded in my old age, but I'm of the opinion that before you jump on IRC and start looking for help you should at least research on your own a little.
[01:36:32] <ServerSage> aaronmcadam: There are plenty of "Top 10 Perl plugin" posts.  Problem is they are all different.  lol.
[01:36:56] <ablomen> ServerSage, but when I google "Can i use javasctript with my jqueryz" nothing comes up :(
[01:37:06] <ServerSage> rofl
[01:37:21] <devinrolsen> facepalm!
[01:37:46] <howtoo> hello, I'm quite new on jquery (and js in general). I have set up an ajax GET request that loads data from a database to be shown in a table. Can someone point me in the right direction for updating the table while the ajax request is processing?
[01:38:32] <luite> howtoo: the .get call is asynchronous, so you can just run more code after that line.
[01:38:57] <James-_> blackspotwiggins
[01:39:05] <James-_> 	var externalid = "<?php $externalid = date("Ymdhis");?>";
[01:39:05] <James-_> 	newFrame.setAttribute("src", "http://www.try.tv/externalid=+externalid+");  why this not work ?
[01:39:07] <howtoo> luite: aha, thanks, I'll look into that
[01:39:28] <HBD> Hi guys, I need a menu to behave something like in the image: http://bayimg.com/pajJoaAdn Can you please suggest a strategy for doing this?
[01:39:46] <ServerSage> howtoo: You won't be able to use data from the AJAX request until it's complete, but you can do other things with the table like have it say, "Getting your data, be patient".
[01:40:41] <ablomen> howtoo, also, if it is a lot (a 1000+ rows?) of data, you can break it up in smaller parts if you don't want your users to wait
[01:40:53] <Zerxer> you could give them a youtube video to watch while they wait
[01:41:00] <howtoo> haha
[01:41:00] <Zerxer> on how to properly set a table
[01:41:02] <IanWizard> I've never used the ui stuff much before. I'm trying to create two columns.  One, a list of items (draggable), and two, will be a dropdown, to select the list that you want to edit, and then that list will be droppable
[01:41:20] <howtoo> ablomen: yeah, it could be more than 1000 rows
[01:41:32] <Zerxer> pagination :(
[01:41:38] <ServerSage> howtoo: You might want to take a look at jqGrid if you are just populating a table with data from a database using ajax calls.
[01:41:43] <ServerSage> howtoo: It's pretty magical.
[01:41:43] <James-_> 	newFrame.setAttribute("src", "http://www.try.tv/externalid=+externalid+");  why this not work ? i think it s problem with +externalid+
[01:41:58] <howtoo> ServerSage: thanks, I'll look into it
[01:42:04] <ablomen> James-_, "http://www.try.tv/externalid="+externalid
[01:42:15] <James-_> ok ablomen thanks
[01:42:50] <ServerSage> howtoo: Your initial reaction will probably be "Oh my GOD this is complicated".  But stick with it.  Once you use it, you'll want to use it every time you display data from a database on a webpage.
[01:43:02] <IanWizard> so basically, you have four lists that you can drag into, and the current visible list, should be changed, by a dropdown.  What would be the proper, jquery-like, way to do that?
[01:43:07] <James-_> not work ablomen this give : http://www.try.tv/externalid=
[01:43:23] <ablomen> James-_, then there is nothing in the externalid variable
[01:43:35] <James-_> 	var externalid = "<?php $externalid = date("Ymdhis");?>";
[01:43:35] <howtoo> ServerSage: I need to use asp.net or php?
[01:43:44] <James-_> ablomen i create external here : 	var externalid = "<?php $externalid = date("Ymdhis");?>";
[01:43:53] <howtoo> I'm writing python =)
[01:44:04] <Zerxer> James-_: your php isn't actually printing anything out
[01:44:08] <ablomen> James-_, can you put your whole code in pastebin/jsfiddle/gist/whatever?
[01:44:08] <ServerSage> howtoo: Nope, it's pure jquery/ajax goodies.
[01:44:19] <howtoo> ok, thanks
[01:44:27] <ablomen> oh lol good catch Zerxer
[01:44:31] <Zerxer> James-_: you'd need to do <?php print date("Ymdhis"); ?>
[01:44:31] <ServerSage> howtoo: At least on the client side.  The backend can be anything (perl, python, C++) as long as it returns JSON or XML.
[01:44:41] <James-_> oups
[01:44:49] <Zerxer> James-_: or <?php $externalid = date("Ymdhis"); print $externalid; ?>
[01:44:52] <Zerxer> if you need it in a php var
[01:44:53] <howtoo> right
[01:44:59] <howtoo> hmm, quite expensive though
[01:45:24] <Rinthe> load-scripts.php:12Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined. what does this mean?
[01:45:25] <James-_> yes i miss that :s
[01:45:29] <James-_> thx ^^
[01:45:32] <ServerSage> howtoo: Yeah, it's a little bulky.  But hey, we all have 30Ghz systems with 40GB of ram, right?
[01:45:49] <howtoo> doubt I can convince the money people =( They tend to not see the joy of presenting data "even better"
[01:45:50] <howtoo> hehe
[01:45:52] <Zerxer> Rinthe: it means jQuery isn't defined. you must not be including the js file properly
[01:45:57] <misterm> Rinthe: in means you're trying to dereference "jQuery" is not defined
[01:46:03] <misterm> *and it
[01:46:18] <Zerxer> I've used DataTables in the past for clients, but I don't know what jqGrid is, if they're two different things
[01:46:20] <ServerSage> howtoo: Wait, monetarily it's free.
[01:46:22] <Rinthe> that's weird..
[01:46:51] <Rinthe> load-scripts.php is a wordpress backend file
[01:46:57] <Rinthe> this onyl happens when i enable some plugin
[01:48:10] <HBD> What's a good grid that you recommend?
[01:48:25] <ServerSage> Zerxer: In my experience with the two, DataTables starts to choke on a few thousand results where jqGrid seems to handle it fine.
[01:48:46] <ServerSage> HBD: You mean like a data table for displaying …well…data?
[01:48:53] <HBD> ServerSage: yeah
[01:48:57] <ServerSage> HBD: DataTables or jqGrid.
[01:48:59] <Zerxer> well, I used ajax pagination for large database tables
[01:49:01] <HBD> hmm
[01:49:41] <ServerSage> Zerxer: I have not tried that.
[01:49:50] <ServerSage> HBD: Is that a good hmm or a bad hmm?
[01:51:23] <HBD> ServerSage: I use both datatables and jqgrid in my app. I'm still looking for something better
[01:51:41] <ServerSage> HBD: What is it about them that you do not like?
[01:52:42] <xp_prg> ok, I am starting to understand it, I know my code is setting the functions on the images, I just need to click on the image now, here is what I have:  <a rel="example_group" id="firstimg" href="./example/9_b.jpg" ti
[01:52:42] <xp_prg> tle="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"><img alt="" src="./example/9_s.jpg" /></a>
[01:52:56] <xp_prg> what is the code to "click" on it?
[01:52:58] <HBD> ServerSage: it's mostly the appearance. for an enterprise web application, the UI needs to be a bit more refined. so, I'm looking for a grid that has that
[01:53:16] <xp_prg> is it like $("#firstimg").click(); ?
[01:53:28] <ServerSage> HBD: You know that you can style them anyway you want with CSS, right?
[01:54:04] <HBD> ServerSage: yes, I know that. But I'm not a designer
[01:55:06] <HBD> ServerSage: so, I started to look at extjs, because their default grid looks fine
[01:55:27] <ServerSage> HBD: Whatever works is what I say.
[01:55:44] <HBD> ServerSage: yes
[01:58:15] <xp_prg> I am getting it to work wow!
[02:02:44] <Guest99079> Can anyone lend a hand with jQuery templates?
[02:04:38] <phobia> regarding my question about adding to load event before jquery is loaded.. I came up with a solution.. any thoughts on it? http://pastebin.com/BQKRsYQM
[02:05:15] <Guest99079> Can anyone lend a hand with jQuery templates?
[02:08:40] <sheepytom> Anyone at all know anything about $.template() ?
[02:13:01] <yii_noob> how can I style dates in datepicker please ?
[02:13:13] <hrwath> style?
[02:13:15] <yii_noob> I have now a array with dates i would like to set CSS
[02:13:27] <yii_noob> to see them coloured like green or red or blue
[02:13:46] <yii_noob> hrwath to show that dates have some events in it
[02:13:49] <hrwath> just take some firebug or something and look what class is responsible for that and overwrite it
[02:14:16] <yii_noob> $( "#cal2" ).datepicker({                defaultDate: d2,                'minDate': d2            });
[02:14:21] <yii_noob> I do that now hrwath
[02:14:43] <yii_noob> so I've thought I need a option or so and pass a classname and a dates array ?
[02:14:54] <sheepytom> No, it's a CSS thing
[02:16:18] <yii_noob> sheepytom I see in firebug all are td's without having an id to reflect what date is that ?
[02:16:50] <yii_noob> just the class name  ui-datepicker-days-cell-over  ui-datepicker-current-day
[02:16:51] <sheepytom> I wouldn't use datepicker for this purpose
[02:16:59] <sheepytom> Perhaps FullCalendar would be more use
[02:17:08] <sheepytom> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[02:17:49] <yii_noob> that is too big sheepytom
[02:18:11] <yii_noob> I need something smaller as Jquery datepicker as i present 4 calendars at a time on a pge
[02:19:22] <nail_> yii_noob: see http://stevethomas.com.au/jquery/jquery-datepicker-ajax-request-to-highlight-days-from-mysql.html
[02:19:42] <nail_> that's the beforeShowDay event
[02:26:39] <xp_prg> ok this was working a[rel=example_group] as my selector then I put the href's in a div with id hidden_images now it doesn't work
[02:26:40] <HBD> Hi, can I invoke a jquery plugin from another jquery plugin? If so, where do I store the markup required for the embedded jquery plugin?
[02:26:56] <xp_prg> any ideas?
[02:27:13] <HBD> For example, depending on how the user invokes my jquery plugin, I want to launch one of four jquery dialogs.
[02:27:32] <xp_prg> oh wait I think I figured it out
[02:28:44] <xp_prg> ok I figured it out
[02:29:23] <sheepytom> Has anyone here used jquery templates? I've got a caching problem that's causing a lot of trouble!
[02:36:48] <yii_noob> nail_ I've seen a example at http://davidwalsh.name/jquery-datepicker-disable-days but as i need to display 4 calendars, I need to call beforeShowDay: noWeekendsOrHolidays with a parameter
[02:37:13] <yii_noob> and beforeShowDay: noWeekendsOrHolidays(d3) output a error
[02:37:13] <Paveloosha> Hi guys is it possible to send two variables at a time without using 'object' like this.............post("search-data.php", {string1:var1,string2:var2,}, ?
[02:37:39] <Paveloosha> Hi guys is it possible to send two variables at a time without using 'object' ? eg. post("search-data.php", {string1:var1,string2:var2,}, ?
[02:38:13] <nail_> yii_noob: beforeShowDay: function() { return noWeekendsOrHolidays(d3); }
[02:40:40] <nail_> Paveloosha: you can pass a query string too, "string1=foo&string2=bar"
[02:41:24] <Paveloosha> Thanks <nail_>, It is working.. :)
[02:42:02] <nail_> welcome
[02:45:13] <philosophically> building a site that uses a lot of ajax calls.. having a problem when one linked is clicked and before it is finished loading, another link is clicked- tis results in multiple actions being performed which screws things up sometimes... is there a way to prevent this, or stop one action and start another one in case a user decides to change what they want to do?
[02:45:31] <yii_noob> nail_ I try var date1 = new Date("7-21-2011"); than beforeShowDay: noWeekendsOrHolidays(date1) but I get x.apply is not a function
[02:46:18] <djj___> Hi I have a jquery-ui datepicker that enables a user to select a entire week which refreshes using an ajax request. I am now trying to make it so that when a user selects a week on reload of the page the selected week should still be highlighted. See my Jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/kALJH/1/
[02:47:57] <djj___> Does anyone have a possible idea as to how I could achieve this?
[02:48:34] <nail_> yii_noob: beforeShowDay: function() { return noWeekendsOrHolidays(d3); } <--- see, it's wrapped
[02:53:15] <xp_prg> can someone tell me what is wrong with this:
[02:53:16] <xp_prg> $.ajax({
[02:53:16] <xp_prg>             type:"GET",
[02:53:16] <xp_prg>             "http://localhost/ajax_test/data.php",
[02:53:22] <xp_prg> oh darn sorry for pasting
[02:54:14] <luite> xp_prg: url:"http://..."
[02:54:34] <luite> it's a javascript object, so everything must be key:value
[02:54:39] <xp_prg> ok thanks sorry
[02:55:50] <luite> you can also use $.ajax(url, { type:"GET", cache:false, ... })
[02:59:58] <OnkelTem> Hi
[03:00:50] <OnkelTem> If a click function already bound to an element, can I add one more function to this elements click?
[03:04:06] <ablomen> OnkelTem, you can add as many event handlers as you want to an element
[03:04:35] <OnkelTem> ablomen: thanks

[03:15:21] <xp_prg> hi all, I am trying to use $.get to retrive some text from a php, in the php I just have echo "hello\n"; but it always says it is returning null
[03:15:25] <xp_prg> is my php wrong?
[03:16:48] <xp_prg> yup, it is not working I have $.get("http://www.google.com", function(data) { alert(data); }, "html");
[03:16:53] <xp_prg> the alert shows nothing
[03:16:57] <xp_prg> what am I doing wrong?
[03:19:02] <quicksilver> xp_prg: you can't use AJAX cross domain
[03:19:25] <quicksilver> you can acheive similar effects with various tricks. If you really want to do this, just google cross domain ajax.
[03:19:40] <xp_prg> well this is running standalone, will it communicate stanalone or must it be served up from the server?
[03:20:11] <xp_prg> brb
[03:20:12] <uchuff> how are you running php without a server?
[03:20:13] <ravenzz> ?crossdomain
[03:20:15] <bot-t> ravenzz, Release:jQuery 1.2/Ajax - http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2/Ajax

[03:20:30] <uchuff> lol
[03:20:31] <ravenzz> no way
[03:21:36] <quicksilver> xp_prg: have no idea what you mean by 'standalone'
[03:21:40] <xp_prg> no the php is on my apache server, the html file with the jquery is just opened by a file
[03:21:57] <xp_prg> firefox->file->open-> ajax_test.html
[03:22:04] <xp_prg> I will just have the server serve it up, and try again
[03:22:08] <quicksilver> yeah, that doesn't work
[03:22:14] <quicksilver> can't AJAX from file:/// URLs
[03:22:35] <ravenzz> xp_prg your html file has to be in the same server
[03:22:37] <quicksilver> although, there is probably a way to configure the browser to permit if if you really want. It's only a browser security restriction.
[03:22:59] <ravenzz> you should make jsonp requests
[03:23:02] <quicksilver> I've never tried. All modern web development systems have built-in development servers :)
[03:23:07] <xp_prg> now it works!
[03:23:09] <xp_prg> ok thanks
[03:44:43] <xp_prg> can jquery make a div?
[03:45:49] <xec> xp_prg: yep
[03:46:03] <TeddyMurray> hi, how would i remove a tr from a table?
[03:46:06] <xec> xp_prg:  $('<div>')
[03:46:12] <TeddyMurray> im using .remove() but its removing the entire table
[03:46:14] <xp_prg> how can I tell it to make a div with id named hiddenDiv that is set to display: none ?
[03:48:08] <xec> xp_prg:  $('<div id="hiddenDiv">').appendTo('body').hide() something like that?
[03:48:42] <xp_prg> ya thanks!
[03:50:26] <xec> TeddyMurray: what are you selecting?
[03:50:51] <TeddyMurray> $('.removeItem').live('click', function() {
[03:50:51] <TeddyMurray>  $(this).parent().parent().remove(); });
[03:51:12] <TeddyMurray> .removeItem is a link within the row i want to remove
[03:51:40] <TeddyMurray> maybe my tr's need an id?
[03:51:48] <xec> you could try $(this).closest('tr').remove();
[03:52:34] <TeddyMurray> awesome
[03:52:36] <TeddyMurray> trying
[03:53:07] <dreinull> I'm trying this to no avail: JSON.stringify($("#someForm")) How would I do it instead of serialize?
[03:53:36] <TeddyMurray> sweet
[03:53:42] <TeddyMurray> thank you xec
[03:53:47] <xec> yw :)
[03:55:07] <Cracker2> hi. did anyone encounter odd behaviour with IE when anchor href='somejquery' refreshed the page and showed [object Object] only?
[03:55:44] <Cracker2> i've added .show .hide and when I press it refreshes completely the page and shows [object Object] text only
[03:55:45] <Cracker2> <li class='hidden'><a class='restore' href=\"javascript: $('.outlooksmall').show(); $('.outlookbig').hide();\">Restore</a></li>
[03:57:23] <xec> Cracker2: i'm not quite sure why or what your issue is, but i would recommend you to never mix html and javascript in the same file (much less the same line) unless you have a good reason to do so
[03:57:59] <Segaja> hi, is there some simple way to get the td element of a specific day in Datepicker?
[03:58:13] <xec> Cracker2: could you make a live demo, at jsfiddle.net for instance?
[03:58:29] <Cracker2> I moved it from href= to onclick= works fine now
[03:59:46] <xec> Cracker2: you could also remove all javascript from html and do something like: $('.restore').click(function(){ /* do stuff here */ });
[04:00:12] <Cracker2> ok. thanks for the suggestion
[04:00:44] <Segaja> other question. how can i select some elements based on the content of the element?
[04:01:02] <Segaja> like i have some links with different numbers in it and i want to select all these links with a 16 in it
[04:02:28] <xec> Segaja: you could select all potential links, loop through them and then look at the content - i don't think theres some nice and easy way to do it
[04:04:17] <Segaja> xec: ok, thanks. i also had that idea
[04:08:02] <rockwild> has anybody else had issues with there being a syntax error in jquery.min.js in IE8? I've seen it happen with 1.6.2 and 1.6.3rc1. On some sites it works fine and others it breaks (we have multiple clients using it). It also works fine in other browsers.
[04:11:25] <xp_prg> can there be multiple $(function() ?
[04:12:38] <rockwild> xp_prg: if what you are trying to do is have multiple functions run on ready, then yes
[04:12:55] <xp_prg> so that is not a syntax errors?
[04:13:25] <rockwild> are you referring to my problem? or is this a question of your own?
[04:14:54] <xec> rockwild: i havent had specific problems with ie8, but i have had js errors pointing at jquery source that was caused by me doing something stupid somewhere else entirely... if you dont use the minified version, maybe it can hint to what's failing?
[04:16:25] <rockwild> xec: it loads jquery but then the line right after that where I use a call to jQuery it tells me that it isn't defined. And I've seen it give syntax errors in the actual file.
[04:17:04] <jita> $('.artist-playlist-wrapper').html(mixes); produces list of mixes in artist-playlist-wrapper container. I want to apply tooltip to each item in mixes. Is it possible ? Can i apply query within another jquery script ?
[04:17:18] <xec> rockwild: and it works fine in other browsers?
[04:17:27] <rockwild> xec: yeah
[04:18:06] <rockwild> it looks like clearing the cache and cookies and completely closing IE fixes it
[04:18:13] <rockwild> just clearing the cache won't do it
[04:19:22] <xec> jita: i'm not sure i understand what you're trying to do, what is the "mixes" var?
[04:19:33] <jita> xec: list of playlists
[04:19:41] <xec> html in a string?
[04:24:45] <jita> xec: http://dpaste.com/606704/
[04:26:58] <xec> jita: if you do console.log(mixes) - what do you get?
[04:27:58] <jita> xec: playlists, fratmusic.com
[04:31:12] <xec> jita: imagine for a second, that i have never used fratmusic.com, don't know when or how the show_mix() function is called, and what the response variable gets set to -- what is the content of the mixes var at runtime?
[04:31:43] <jita> xec: 1 sec nly
[04:31:51] <jita> xec: i will paste that
[04:31:56] <xec> :)
[04:32:19] <jita> xec: that was my mistake :P
[04:37:10] <Baribal> Hi. I'm using .sortable("toArray") to store a sorting order in a variable. How do I restore it?
[04:42:05] <jita> xec: firebug says mixes is not defined :(
[04:42:45] <xec> jita: did you put the console.log() inside the function, after it is declared?
[04:44:45] <jita> xec: frankly telling, i am really new to jquery and javascript, i think i will rather read some tutorial before i delve into the code, ty for your effort to help
[04:45:51] <xec> jita: ok, good luck. this free online book has helped me learn; http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[04:46:21] <jita> xec: thanks for the link
[04:52:29] <Peeter> Is there a way to use jQuerys inArray method with objects?
[04:55:13] <Peeter> heh
[04:55:21] <Peeter> You can use if(value in object)
[05:02:31] <dwarder> i have a button which has onclick value set to my function, which accepts 1 param, to this parram i want to assign value that is in input tag with id="param"
[05:02:47] <dwarder> what is the right way to pass this value to my function
[05:03:34] <dwarder> <input type=button onclick="myfunction('(#param)')"> ?
[05:03:42] <dwarder> <input type=button onclick="myfunction('(#param.value)')"> ?
[05:04:27] <xec> dwarder: when you supply a function to onclick="" it will be given arguments automatically - what exactly are you trying to pass it?
[05:04:29] <nail_> myfunction($('#param').val()) , but try not to use inline event handlers wherever it's possible
[05:06:09] <Voziv> Hello, I'm trying to use jqgrid for adding and deleting rows, and so far I'm stuck at the point of where I need to add an extra parameter to my POST when I add a row. I've tried adding it to editData: as I've found while googling the issue but it doesn't seem to do anything
[05:06:12] <dmarkey> is $.tmpl
[05:06:16] <dmarkey> considered stable
[05:07:22] <nail_> xec: there's no argument given automatically when you bind with onclick="", however "this" will refer to the element
[05:07:42] <xec> hmm
[05:07:43] <dwarder> nail_: thank you
[05:10:34] <xec> nail_: right, i must be confusing it with... something
[05:12:58] <nail_> but onclick is soooooooo '90 anyway :p
[05:13:52] <xec> right, when you do $('input').click(myFunction) - THATs when it gets supplied arguments
[05:14:16] <JAAulde> g'morning jQuerians!
[05:14:26] <xec> afternoon JAAulde
[05:15:56] <zabka> hi, can i call something before mouseover? im trying to call post while doing mouseover, but sometimes it keep calling page all the time.
[05:16:27] <JAAulde> So one of my favorite features of .toggle() ( http://api.jquery.com/toggle ) is the ability to pass a bool which says whether to show or hide. But it seems one cannot pass a bool as the first param, followed by a string denoting which effect to use. Is this correct,or am I missing something?
[05:17:30] <nail_> zabka: mouseenter? not sure to understand what you want
[05:18:37] <xp_prg> hi all, I have loaded the fancybox jQuery plugin in Drupal, I am just trying to confirm it is there, can anyone tell me the easiest way to do that?
[05:19:05] <xec> try to use it? :)
[05:19:24] <xp_prg> I am trying in the firebug console, I put this in:  jQuery.fancybox({content: "wow"});
[05:19:37] <xp_prg> it says:  TypeError { source="with(_FirebugCommandLin...x({content: "wow"});\n};", fileName="resource://firebug_rjs/...e/commandLineExposed.js", lineNumber=149}
[05:20:45] <zabka> nail_: i have also have more questions... sorry.. i don't know how can i explain it... http://pastebin.com/9sjCypsj <-- soemtimes it keep posting (line 4)... lie there was a loop
[05:21:21] <Voziv> Anyone know how to add extra parameters to my POST when adding a row to jqGrid?
[05:21:24] <xec> xp_prg: that should work, maybe the url for fancybox script is off?
[05:21:59] <nail_> zabka: you mean it posts multiple times when you enter *once* ?
[05:22:11] <nail_> or do you want to post only the first time it enters
[05:22:34] <zabka> yes, it posts multiple times nail_
[05:22:47] <zabka> when i enter once
[05:22:50] <xp_prg> getting another error:  $.support is undefined on this line:  isIE6 = !$.support.opacity && !window.XMLHttpRequest,  for this js file: jquery.fancybox-1.x.x etc..
[05:22:51] <m3l7_> hi
[05:23:01] <zabka> maybe i enter this wrong..
[05:24:19] <m3l7_> I have a function (i.e. func1() ) which has to call func2 with some parameters
[05:24:40] <m3l7_> I want to pass the parameters to func1
[05:25:26] <m3l7_> what can I do?
[05:25:50] <zabka> 2. i m replaceing html (line 7). in this html im printing  <div class="bubbleInfo" >... etc. how can i activate/call  $('.bubbleInfo').live("mouseover mouseout", function(event)( line 12) just  after the html appeared?
[05:25:55] <johnwards> i've got an issue with http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ when I have name="options[]" type fields
[05:26:04] <m3l7_> I don't want to do something like    func1(par1,par2,par3 ecc)
[05:26:08] <johnwards> it only creates an array of 1 level
[05:26:20] <JAAulde> So one of my favorite features of .toggle() ( http://api.jquery.com/toggle ) is the ability to pass a bool which says whether to show or hide. But it seems one cannot pass a bool as the first param, followed by a string denoting which effect to use. Is this correct, or am I missing something?
[05:26:33] <xec> m3l7_: something like: function func1() { func2(arguments); }
[05:26:34] <johnwards> it should be an n-level array depending on the form
[05:26:49] <Narhir> I have somewhere in code something like "menuid"
[05:27:00] <Narhir> if I will change it to "menuclass" will it take class instead of id ?
[05:27:05] <m3l7_> xec, so arguments is an array?
[05:27:25] <xec> m3l7_: almost, it's an array-"like" object
[05:27:42] <m3l7_> xec, note that I want to pass the reference of func2 to func1
[05:28:00] <xec> m3l7_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/functions_and_function_scope/arguments
[05:28:32] <xec> m3l7_: what, like: func1 = func2;
[05:28:34] <xec> :P
[05:30:01] <m3l7_> xec, like   func1(nextfunction, arguments) { ....;   nextfunction(arguments);}
[05:30:07] <xp_prg> how can I tell if jQuery is even installed?
[05:30:30] <xp_prg> oh wow its working now wow
[05:31:05] <m3l7_> xec, I need that because in func1 there is some ajax code, so I need to wait for it
[05:31:17] <xec> m3l7_: that should work... i think?
[05:31:32] <Narhir> if I have that kind of code: jqueryslidemenu.buildmenu("myslidemenu", arrowimages) can I add another MENU ID to this line of code? for example I would like to add "myslidemenu2" as well.. how can I do it?
[05:31:50] <m3l7_> xec, yeah but how can I pass arguments to func1? let's say I want to pass 3 parameters
[05:33:28] <xec> i'm missing something, what's calling func1? cant you just supply arguments to it like you do anything else?
[05:35:01] <m3l7_> xec, yeah but I have to pass n arguments, i.e.   func1(nextfunc, par1,par2,par3)
[05:35:36] <m3l7_> but they can be 4, 5 or 6
[05:36:01] <m3l7_> and this is a problem :|
[05:36:23] <Baribal> Hi again. I'm at a complete loss at how to reorder elements of a sortable from code. toArray has the right functionality the wrong way around. I have a sorted list of IDs and want to rearrange the elements on the screen, but... how?
[05:36:32] <m3l7_> I have to call func2 regardless of how many parameters I want to call
[05:37:09] <m3l7_> I need a way to collect them in an object or array
[05:37:37] <Cork> m3l7_: so just do func1(nextfunc) {}
[05:37:48] <Cork> get the parameters from arbuments
[05:37:59] <m3l7_> mmmh
[05:38:27] <m3l7_> and then I can call func1 like    func1(func2,par1, par2, .... );
[05:38:28] <m3l7_> ?
[05:38:36] <Cork> ?eval function func1(nextfunc) { var params = argument.slice(1); print params }; func1(function() {}, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
[05:38:37] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[05:38:51] <Cork> ?eval function func1(nextfunc) { var params = argument.slice(1); print(params); }; func1(function() {}, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
[05:38:51] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: argument is not defined
[05:38:58] <Cork> ?eval function func1(nextfunc) { var params = arguments.slice(1); print(params); }; func1(function() {}, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
[05:38:58] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: arguments.slice is not a function
[05:39:01] <xec> :D
[05:39:02] <Cork> ARG!
[05:39:18] <Cork> one min i'll code this in a browser instead
[05:39:26] <m3l7_> ok :)
[05:40:32] <FD_Good> hello i have a simple chat code here http://codepad.org/mg5s5gMA. How to make it auto load with jquery ?
[05:41:05] <Cork> AH ya
[05:41:10] <Cork> arguments isn't an array
[05:41:39] <xec> var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
[05:41:46] <Cork> YA
[05:42:04] <Cork> ?eval function func1(nextfunc) { var params = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1); print(params); }; func1(function() {}, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
[05:42:05] <bot-t> Cork: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
[05:42:42] * xec cheers
[05:43:27] <m3l7_> Cork, so I can call func2 using    func2(params) ?
[05:43:42] <Cork> m3l7_: exactly
[05:43:47] <m3l7_> ok thanks! :D
[05:43:58] <Cork> or func2.apply(null, params);
[05:44:09] <Cork> if you prefer to get them as arguments instead of an array
[05:44:38] <xec> yes! apply was what i was looking for
[05:45:23] <m3l7_> slice.call(arguments, 1) so the 1 is used to search for parameters starting from 1 ?
[05:45:41] <Cork> no
[05:45:50] <Cork> first argument to call becomes this
[05:45:56] <Cork> 2+ is parameters
[05:46:10] <m3l7_> ok
[05:46:22] <Cork> applay(arg, argx) arg becomes this argx in an array that becomes arguments
[05:46:35] <Cork> *apply
[05:46:47] <m3l7_> ok thanks
[05:49:17] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: do you know if $('#jquery') uses getElById or QSA?
[05:52:41] <m3l7_> Cork, so in this way nextfunc should be always the last argument of func1, otherwise other arguments, which are not netfunc parameters will be confused
[05:52:42] <m3l7_> right?
[05:53:05] <Cork> m3l7_: the oposit
[05:53:07] <m3l7_> like   func1(var1,var2, nextfunc)
[05:53:14] <Cork> it should always be the first argument
[05:53:23] <m3l7_> mmh
[05:53:28] <m3l7_> wait
[05:53:31] <Cork> func1(nextfunc, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
[05:53:43] <m3l7_> yeah, but 1,2,3 are all nextfunc parameter
[05:53:55] <Cork> so?
[05:53:55] <Lampoon> so are you
[05:53:57] <m3l7_> if I want other arguments that can be used by func1
[05:54:03] <m3l7_> but not by nextfunc
[05:54:05] <xec> splice(1) starts at second parameter
[05:54:15] <m3l7_> I have to put them before nextfunc
[05:54:18] <Cork> m3l7_: then you don't send them through func1
[05:54:54] <Peeter> Is it possible to have a general variable added to any $.ajax call made with jQuery?
[05:55:05] <Cork> m3l7_: func1(function(){ nextfunc(attributes, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7); },10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17);
[05:55:31] <Cork> m3l7_: or use $.extend and create a new array and send that through apply
[05:55:42] <m3l7_> mmm ok
[05:57:02] <Cork> m3l7_: alternatively you can send it through func1, but then you need to find what arguments to send and who to keep
[05:58:00] <m3l7_> yes
[06:00:20] <domcat> an ideas why jquery cycle stops the slideshow when I switch the tab and get back to it?
[06:01:17] <fruitbat> Can anyone help me create a selector to find li's that do not have child uls?
[06:01:23] <aaronmcadam> keyframe maybe?
[06:01:36] <aaronmcadam> sure
[06:02:30] <Peeter> Is it possible to have a general variable added to any $.ajax call made with jQuery?
[06:03:45] <Cracker2> why I can't pass variable from one .js file to another when it is inside $(document).ready(function() { } of first .js file?
[06:04:34] <aaronmcadam> fruitbat $('li').filter( function() { return $(this).has( ':not(ul)'); } ); something like that
[06:04:50] <Cracker2> var yoyo = 'h3ll0'; $(document).ready(function() { ... } works fine when I alert(yoyo); in another js file
[06:05:09] <Cracker2> $(document).ready(function() { var yoyo = 'h3ll0'; ... } says yoyo undefined in that other js file

[06:14:40] <aaronmcadam> you don't want to do it that way fruit
[06:15:10] <aaronmcadam> but no children should work maybe
[06:15:11] <giulivo> hi guys, please excuse my stupid question
[06:15:32] <giulivo> but can't select a span inside a div
[06:15:53] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ giulivo
[06:15:54] <bot-t> giulivo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:15:59] <giulivo> is the following syntax valid and allowed? $('#divid > span#spanid')
[06:16:15] <aaronmcadam> giulivo: you don't need the >
[06:16:24] <aaronmcadam> unless you want it to be the direct descendant
[06:16:42] <giulivo> uhm not sure what a "direct descent" is
[06:16:43] <aaronmcadam> meaning that will only select a span directly inside a div
[06:16:51] <aaronmcadam> like <div><span/><div>
[06:16:54] <giulivo> yeah that's what I was trying to achieve
[06:17:14] <aaronmcadam> it would *not* select it within this <div><p><span/></p><div>
[06:17:14] <giulivo> so that should be okay?
[06:17:19] <giulivo> fine
[06:17:32] <Voziv> Can anyone point me in a direction where I can find help with jqGrid?
[06:17:35] <kborchers> giulivo: why not just do $("#spanid"); ?  that's the fastest and since id's are unique ...
[06:17:39] <aaronmcadam> you don'y need it
[06:17:43] <aaronmcadam> yeah! haha
[06:17:58] <giulivo> kborchers, because there are many, all with the same id, while the divs have unique ids
[06:18:05] <kborchers> bad boy!
[06:18:07] <aaronmcadam> > selectors are only really useful for classed elements
[06:18:16] <aaronmcadam> ah jesus man haha :D
[06:18:22] <kborchers> id's should always be unique!!!!!
[06:18:31] <giulivo> the html is auto generated by the app
[06:18:35] <aaronmcadam> i bet he's got like 5 duplicate statements one after the other
[06:18:42] <giulivo> the divs have some unique ids, but the spans inside don't
[06:18:42] <aaronmcadam> fix the app then
[06:19:05] <giulivo> aaronmcadam, not 5, but dozens
[06:19:12] <giulivo> (of divs)
[06:19:13] <aaronmcadam> have you never heard of a loop
[06:19:15] <aaronmcadam> :P
[06:19:29] <fruitbat> aaronmcadam: thanks for that, cracked it now :)
[06:19:35] <aaronmcadam> good man fruitbat
[06:19:47] <aaronmcadam> what did u use in the end?
[06:20:00] <fruitbat> $('ul.tree li.parent ul').filter( function() {
[06:20:00] <fruitbat> return $(this).children().length==0;
[06:20:00] <fruitbat> } ).closest('li').removeClass('parent');
[06:20:11] <giulivo> aaronmcadam, taking apart the app, should the ids be unique ?
[06:20:24] <Webpro123> hello, I was wondering is it possible it call a php function with $.post, so I only need 1 php file.
[06:20:36] <aaronmcadam> yes
[06:20:38] <aaronmcadam> always
[06:20:46] <aaronmcadam> even if their parents have unique ids
[06:20:49] <aaronmcadam> makes no sense
[06:20:58] <aaronmcadam> imagine if photo ids were all the same :P
[06:21:04] <aaronmcadam> id is an id for a reason
[06:21:19] <ezflashback> i want to edit the css of a modul on my page
[06:21:19] <ezflashback>   i replaced the widget.js and edited the css paths inside
[06:21:23] <giulivo> so the divs have unique ids, the spans inside the divs don't
[06:21:31] <giulivo> assuming that I can set a class on the spans
[06:21:35] <Webpro123>  I was wondering is it possible it call a php function with $.post, so I only need 1 php file.
[06:21:47] <aaronmcadam> yes that'd be fine why do u even need a class or id on the span anyway?
[06:21:47] <ezflashback>   when i use the my custom widget.js the links escape
[06:21:47] <ezflashback>   http://www.be-broke.com/ ... at the bottom of the page ... the twitter modul
[06:21:48] <kborchers> giulivo: why not just give them all a class inside the divs with unique id's? then you could do $('#divid > .theClass')
[06:21:52] <giulivo> would $('#divid > span.class') correctly identify the span inside the div?
[06:22:11] <aaronmcadam> you don't need the >
[06:22:18] <Webpro123> is it possible it call a php function with $.post, so I only need 1 php file.
[06:22:28] <aaronmcadam> don't use a selector u don't fully understand
[06:22:36] <R1ck> aaronmcadam: you said async, which makes sense, is there a way to do it synchronously or would you go about it in a completely different way?
[06:22:50] <aaronmcadam> read that site R1ck ajpiano explains how to
[06:22:51] <kborchers> giulivo: i would use the > if they are direct children of the div. it will speed up the selector as long as you don't need it to search any deeper
[06:22:57] <toastyghost> webpro123: you can pass a postdata parameter to the php file, then use a select statement to tell it what to do
[06:22:58] <aaronmcadam> or how to rethink your solution
[06:22:58] <giulivo> fine, thanks
[06:23:04] <R1ck> aaronmcadam: oh, okay
[06:23:10] <giulivo> again, thanks
[06:23:10] <toastyghost> also, don't spam :) it takes a minute to type a response
[06:23:23] <Webpro123> how do you do that?
[06:23:24] <aaronmcadam> kborchers: yeah but problem is, he didn't actually know that's what that selector does
[06:23:35] <kborchers> oh, i see
[06:23:45] <toastyghost> $.post takes an array of postdata
[06:23:57] <giulivo> aaronmcadam, I think I did, it's the same meaning it's got as css selector isn't it?
[06:24:55] <toastyghost> $.post('myfile.php',{key1:'value1',key2:'value2},function(){do stuff when you get a response();});
[06:25:33] <toastyghost> so you could make that array be like... action:'update',name:'johnny'
[06:26:00] <toastyghost> then in your php file.. select $_REQUEST['action']
[06:26:23] <toastyghost> case 'update': $db->update('name',$_REQUEST['name']);
[06:26:26] <toastyghost> or whatever you need to do
[06:26:48] <Webpro123> I don't understand this fully
[06:27:13] <toastyghost> which part?
[06:27:51] <Webpro123> the Request thing.
[06:28:52] <Webpro123> or is there a simpler way of validating alot of things but one at a time in one php file.
[06:29:30] <Webpro123> I want an error message to display onkeyup for each one next to each one.
[06:29:59] <xp_prg> ok I am sooo close to having this work, I am using fancybox, I put my images in a hidden div, as <a href links, I click on my text and I see the fancybox start to show the image and then it actually goes to the href image and displays it, as if this is not working:  event.preventDefault();
[06:30:29] <xp_prg> can someone pretty please tell me how to prevent it from actually goingto the href which is to an image?
[06:30:55] <toastyghost> $_REQUEST is just a system variable in php
[06:30:56] <xp_prg> the event is actually being executed
[06:31:14] <toastyghost> but you might want to just do validation on the client side
[06:31:42] <Webpro123> what side is that?
[06:31:47] <toastyghost> javascript
[06:31:52] <Webpro123> oh with jquery?
[06:31:55] <toastyghost> ie, no ajax request
[06:31:57] <toastyghost> yeah
[06:32:16] <Webpro123> I think its a little more complicated.
[06:33:55] <toastyghost> it depends on how complicated the validation is and how detrimental it is if the user can see it
[06:33:56] <xp_prg> please can someone help me?
[06:34:27] <toastyghost> like software keys, for example
[06:34:34] <Webpro123> I know php way more than js/jquery.
[06:34:35] <toastyghost> you don't want to put that algorithm in the javascript 8)
[06:35:02] <Webpro123> what about email.
[06:35:47] <Webpro123> email with php is easy.
[06:36:00] <natrixnatrix89> is there a way I could preload a *.swf, without displaying it?
[06:37:06] <toastyghost> you can't email with js
[06:37:25] <Brak> sure you can, head to #nodejs
[06:37:26] <Brak> lol
[06:37:44] <Webpro123> no validating email
[06:38:09] <jimevans> not knowing the etiquette of this particular channel, i'll just dive in and ask my question (happy to be redirected to a mailing list if needed)
[06:38:52] <jimevans> i work on the selenium project, and need to be able to automate elements using jquery.
[06:39:24] <jimevans> in particular, select elements don't fire the jquery 'change' event in ie when the html onchange event is fired.
[06:40:15] <jimevans> what magic to i need to invoke to trigger the jquery change event (without resorting to calling .trigger())?
[06:42:03] <kborchers> jimevans: selects do trigger change http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/FDBYg/
[06:43:08] <jimevans> kborchers: yeah, but i need to go the other way. do a "e.fireEvent('onchange')", and have the jquery change event triggered.
[06:44:13] <kborchers> in my example then you would just do $("#test").change();
[06:51:18] <jimevans> kborchers: i'm trying to accomplish something like the following http://jsfiddle.net/jimevans/a5DUE/
[06:52:36] <jimevans> in that example, the jquery change event never gets triggered, though the select element gets updated.
[06:52:46] <kborchers> jimevans: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/a5DUE/1/
[06:53:21] <jimevans> i'm specifically looking for a way to force the jquery event, without calling a jquery method.
[06:53:25] <Neiluj> hey
[06:53:39] <Neiluj> I need a little help for my plugin good naming
[06:54:11] <Neiluj> it's a DOM serializer, like innerHTML || outerHTML but better
[06:54:22] <Rickardo1> Why not use live for all my bindings,, what is the hook?
[06:54:26] <Neiluj> $.serialize already exists :/
[06:54:48] <Neiluj> any idea ?
[06:55:13] <kborchers> jimevans: why not use the jquery change method? that makes it cross-browser. otherwise i think you have to use fireEvent in IE and dispatchEvent in most others
[06:56:07] <kborchers> Rickardo1: it adds extra overhead and what if at some point you don't want a new element that meets that selector to have that binding?
[06:56:20] <jimevans> kborchers: i get the advantages of jquery, but the selenium project can't rely on jquery being present.
[06:56:27] <jimevans> injecting it for every call seems like overkill
[06:56:49] <jimevans> and special case detection for jquery's presence seems fragile to me.
[06:59:01] <xp_prg> well fancybox didn't work cuz of conflicts I guess
[06:59:10] <xp_prg> it tried to work but wouldn't work
[06:59:42] <xp_prg> anyone know if it is possible to make lightbox work by reading images on a hidden div?
[07:01:28] <kborchers> jimevans: hmmm, i think i understand your issue now. that's a tough one. still thinking
[07:03:12] <jimevans> kborchers: appreciate the assist. we usually use native OS-level events to work around this problem, but due to IE's quirks, that's not feasible for selecting options
[07:06:53] <kouber> any idea why a .click event over parent div is triggered first, and after it the .click of his child?
[07:07:05] <kouber> I want it the other way around
[07:07:55] <hooloovoo> kouber: You'd prolly have to lock some actions using mouseenter etc.
[07:08:34] <kouber> aha... to unbind and bind the parent trigger
[07:08:41] <kouber> when mouse over the child
[07:09:05] <hooloovoo> kouber: If you want to. I'd just use a var lock = false/true and run actions depending on the state of that var.
[07:09:21] <hooloovoo> and change the state depending on which element your mouse is over
[07:10:04] <kouber> I was also thinking of something like that... but still was wondering whether there isn't some special priority rule
[07:10:40] <hooloovoo> That, sir, i do not know. =P
[07:11:36] <kouber> :-)
[07:11:39] <kouber> found also that http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[07:11:54] <kouber> but the var solution seems quicker to implement, than reading all this
[07:11:55] <Connorhd> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-flow
[07:14:42] <anli_> Does jquery implement .scrollIntoView?
[07:14:59] <anli_> And can I see if an element is needing that simply?
[07:17:14] <kborchers> jimevans: not sure what the solution is. from what i can tell, the event just isn't fired by IE so no way for the change handler to be executed if there isn't an event
[07:17:43] <kborchers> the event being the onchange when the selected element is changed programmatically
[07:18:56] <jimevans> kborchers: i see that. i'm not above manually firing the event, but that doesn't seem to help either.
[07:21:01] <opius> hi, i have this bug.. my script works in chrome but not in ie for some reason.. in ie it get's to an endless loop.. http://jsfiddle.net/qydAw/
[07:23:29] <yii_noob> nail_ can you tell me what i disabled: true for a calendar should not allow me to select dates into it isn't it ?
[07:23:44] <yii_noob> I mean  disabled: true for a calendar should not allow me to select dates into it isn't it ?
[07:24:00] <yii_noob> for a datepicker *
[07:24:56] <yii_noob> hmmm
[07:25:12] <yii_noob> how can I make a datepicker to not allow selections ?
[07:26:32] <crankharder> so I guess $.load will insert the results into the given element -- can I somehow append it instead?
[07:26:36] <anli_> Interesting feature request, to be able to make it read only
[07:27:12] <kborchers> jimevans: this may not be helpful but may be informational (not sure it a later bug was filed and fixed or not either) docs#6420
[07:27:13] <bot-t> jimevans, [#6420] change event originating from vanilla JS doesn't propagate to jQuery bound handler in iE (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/6420
[07:28:02] <Usse> you can always use preventDefault
[07:28:33] <anli_> yii_noob: I think I would have put a div on top of it
[07:28:43] <anli_> Although thats not the most beautiful thing
[07:30:52] <pzaljr> Can anyone help me with a jqPlot bug?
[07:32:54] <pzaljr> http://jsfiddle.net/g6JQm/
[07:33:20] <pzaljr> problem with this is that when the chart is processed, my dates come through at 1970 -> 2006
[07:33:37] <pzaljr> except the data only has stuff between the $start_date and $end_date there
[07:40:39] <Xeon06_> Hey all
[07:41:03] <Xeon06_> I'm trying to find a site... it was a GitHub driven site that indexed a lot of JS frameworks and libraries
[07:41:04] <MoTiOnXml> i'm looking for something that allows me to resize columns
[07:41:18] <Xeon06_> There was a dropdown asking you what kind of library you were looking for (IE, ajax wrapper, etc)
[07:41:23] <MoTiOnXml> i.e. the stuff on jsfiddle, where you grab a colum/seperator and resize
[07:41:26] <MoTiOnXml> what's the name of that?
[07:41:31] <jonclark> xeon, the neon-y one?
[07:41:50] <jonclark> black bg with lots of colours?
[07:42:03] <Xeon06_> jonclark: Yes!
[07:42:07] <jonclark> http://microjs.com/
[07:42:24] <Xeon06_> jonclark: Thanks! That's it!
[07:42:28] <jonclark> yey
[07:42:47] <kborchers> MoTiOnXml: not sure how it works (or if it works) on table cells but there is alway jQuery UI resizable
[07:43:12] <MoTiOnXml> kborchers: it's a splitter i'm looking for
[07:43:15] <jonclark> MoTiOnXml: maybe http://methvin.com/splitter/?
[07:43:21] <MoTiOnXml> :)
[07:43:33] <MoTiOnXml> jonclark: was just about to paste that url :)
[07:43:41] <MoTiOnXml> \o all, great - that's what I need
[07:43:56] <jonclark> sometimes you just gotta start typing in irc to get your memory going :P
[07:44:19] <MoTiOnXml> spot on :)
[07:45:27] <MoTiOnXml> although that splitter seems a bit "borken"
[07:45:59] <jonclark> yeah def not as nice as jsfiddle
[07:46:44] <MoTiOnXml> just wondering if one couldn't do this with css alone
[07:46:51] <MoTiOnXml> would be nice with css support
[07:47:04] <|RicharD|> hi to all
[07:47:27] <|RicharD|> why with $(".viewall a").click(function() {
[07:47:29] <|RicharD|>    	$(this).next('div').css('display', 'block'); not set the next div after .viewall link to display block ?no errors...
[07:48:21] <MoTiOnXml> another nice splitter @ http://krikus.com/js/splitter/
[07:48:38] <Xeon06_> Is there any equivalent to the continue statement for jQuery template's {{each}}?
[07:55:14] <hariom> I am loading an html fragment using ajax into base page's div element. My idea is that when base page is loaded, I will fire ajax to load the extra html fragment and when a particular link is clicked on base page, I will show this extra html fragment in a dialog box. I want to know, how to make sure that this extra html is not show on the base page but only appears when dialog is opened?
[07:59:28] <SergSergiu> hariom is used iframes in your example...is not good...but working
[07:59:44] <kborchers> hariom: load it into a hidden div
[08:00:00] <SergSergiu> i used*
[08:02:37] <|RicharD|> an idea
[08:02:44] <|RicharD|> for my problem ? where i wrong ?
[08:02:48] <|RicharD|> $(".viewall a").click(function() {
[08:02:49] <|RicharD|>    	$(this).next('div').css('display', 'block');
[08:02:55] <hariom> kborchers: If I keep the style of the div inwhich I am loading extra html fragment to display:none; I guess it won't show when dialog is called.
[08:03:11] <hariom> Sergsergiu: No, iframe
[08:03:25] <enjoycrf> whats the problem rich
[08:03:38] <kborchers> hariom: are you using the jQuery UI dialog? i do that all the time. it will work just fine
[08:04:05] <hariom> kborchers: even if display:none?
[08:04:13] <kborchers> yep
[08:04:17] <hariom> ok
[08:05:38] <kborchers> hariom: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/aYD5Z/
[08:06:20] <hariom> kborchers: thats nice. Thanks
[08:08:34] <jwmann> Is there a way to grab a specific attribute of an element? like $this[id="foo"]
[08:09:14] <kborchers> jwmann: by grab you mean get the value of the attribute? see ?attr

[08:14:50] <jwmann> Is there a way to echo $this, just to see what it outputs?
[08:15:04] <kborchers> console.log($(this));
[08:15:14] <michael_mbp> kborchers: ideas mate?
[08:15:20] <jwmann> Ahh, there's bracket between this
[08:15:24] <jwmann> okay
[08:15:42] <michael_mbp> shouldn't something simple like this just work
[08:15:46] <jwmann> ty kborchers

[08:18:04] <|RicharD|> here not give me the error :S
[08:18:11] <|RicharD|> anyway the work not work well :)
[08:18:12] <jwmann> kborchers: Can 'attr' be used as a selector?
[08:18:14] <kborchers> michael_mbp: i have a feeling but what error are you getting?
[08:18:18] <|RicharD|> the job not work well :P
[08:18:31] <michael_mbp> xhr.responseText = nothing
[08:18:43] <kborchers> jwmann: $("element[attributeName='attributeValue']");
[08:18:48] <michael_mbp> if I look at textStatus, errorThrown one of those gives 'error'

[08:19:30] <michael_mbp> kborchers: see line 81 https://gist.github.com/1186379
[08:20:05] <michael_mbp> of course in .ajax I didn't set datatype because I don't csv is a valid dataType ?
[08:20:27] <jwmann> kborchers: Well I just want to grab the value of the specific Attribute
[08:20:32] <kborchers> michael_mbp: not sure but i would imagine you are running into see ?sop

Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[08:20:46] <pzaljr> http://jsfiddle.net/g6JQm/
[08:20:49] <pzaljr> problem with this is that when the chart is processed, my dates come through at 1970 -> 2006
[08:20:51] <pzaljr> except the data only has stuff between the $start_date and $end_date there
[08:21:02] <michael_mbp> cross-site scripting eh?
[08:21:16] <kborchers> michael_mbp: that's what i'm thinking
[08:21:33] <|RicharD|> http://jsfiddle.net/yVwu2/ nobody can help me ?
[08:21:35] <michael_mbp> only directly accessible?
[08:21:44] <kborchers> check those errors to see if you can get anything more specific
[08:21:58] <michael_mbp> nothing at all, I've checked :(
[08:22:02] <kborchers> michael_mbp: might only work server side since they don't have a jsonp option
[08:22:16] <michael_mbp> kborchers there's a rails gem called ystock
[08:22:17] <michael_mbp> it works
[08:22:32] <michael_mbp> essentially connects to the URL and downloads the .csv
[08:22:38] <michael_mbp> let me gist it up
[08:23:10] <jwmann> kborchers: I'm trying to do something like: $(this)[href] which would return => path
[08:23:26] <kborchers> i'm not a ruby guy but isn't rails the server side and ruby the client side so it would make sense that rails can access it ... again, not a rails guy
[08:23:54] <|RicharD|> no
[08:23:55] <kborchers> jwmann: right, so you use what i gave you earlier and do $(this).attr("href")
[08:24:01] <|RicharD|> rails is a framework built on ruby
[08:24:03] <|RicharD|> all here
[08:24:06] <|RicharD|> all server side
[08:24:19] <michael_mbp> kborchers: https://gist.github.com/1186409
[08:24:23] <jwmann> kborchers: Ah, okay. I thuoght that was only used for 'setting' an attr
[08:24:38] <michael_mbp> ah it's a simple script
[08:24:43] <michael_mbp> but yea this is server side
[08:24:49] <michael_mbp> the problem is
[08:24:50] <enjoycrf> stay away from ruby
[08:24:56] <|RicharD|> http://jsfiddle.net/yVwu2/ anybody can see why not work ?
[08:25:03] <michael_mbp> when this script triggers it halts the HTTP process
[08:25:04] <michael_mbp> enjoycrf: I love ruby
[08:25:12] <|RicharD|> also i love ruby :)
[08:25:13] <enjoycrf> its prety lame
[08:25:18] <|RicharD|> why ?
[08:25:19] <m3l7> lol
[08:25:20] <michael_mbp> python, C++, JAVA...
[08:25:22] <|RicharD|> explan it
[08:25:27] <|RicharD|> lol :) python guy
[08:25:28] <enjoycrf> its weak
[08:25:32] <|RicharD|> django right ?
[08:25:36] <enjoycrf> i kno ruby
[08:25:37] <michael_mbp> naw...
[08:25:42] <michael_mbp> never really got into django
[08:25:43] <enjoycrf> python
[08:25:52] <enjoycrf> ruby is not a serious language
[08:25:55] <kborchers> i haven't botherd with ruby since it does too much for you. i like being able to granularly control my code
[08:25:57] <michael_mbp> mainly cli scripts to do various mashups etc.
[08:26:17] <michael_mbp> DB stuff etc., oh...manage some processes on my robot once.
[08:26:21] <enjoycrf> ruby is like a noob wrap of python
[08:26:29] <michael_mbp> anywas
[08:26:44] <michael_mbp> kborchers: I can stick to the gem/script
[08:26:49] <michael_mbp> and run it as a background job
[08:26:51] <|RicharD|> anyway nobody can see this ? http://jsfiddle.net/yVwu2/ i want know where i wrong
[08:26:54] <kborchers> michael_mbp: but that still gets back to my point that it prob has to be server side
[08:27:02] <michael_mbp> it's making a direct HTTP connection to that URL
[08:27:06] <michael_mbp> yeah.
[08:27:20] <michael_mbp> so the direct http request from the app isn't considered SOP I guess
[08:27:41] <enjoycrf> C, C++, BASH, PYTHON, PERL, PHP, ASP, Coldfusion, C#, VBScript, Javascript, Actionscript
[08:27:51] <enjoycrf> those r the ones i use
[08:28:02] <michael_mbp> phpsadness.com
[08:28:06] <kborchers> michael_mbp: servers can talk directly to each other, it's when the client gets involved that SOP comes into play
[08:28:06] <michael_mbp> fun site :)
[08:28:12] <|RicharD|> enjoycrf: i'm joking ;)
[08:28:16] <michael_mbp> kborchers: ah yeah
[08:28:24] <|RicharD|> enjoycrf: i work on php and i fun on ruby
[08:28:41] <michael_mbp> these days I'm loving ruby, not touched php in a few weeks.
[08:28:47] <kborchers> |RicharD|: why are you doing that instead of just linking directly to the google CDN's?
[08:29:00] <|RicharD|> umh is better ?
[08:29:01] <michael_mbp> anyways thanks kborchers
[08:29:07] <|RicharD|> anyway the jquery is loaded
[08:29:13] <michael_mbp> I'll leave enjoycrf to his ruby hating :)
[08:29:43] <enjoycrf> my name is not hatecrf sawrt
[08:29:44] <enjoycrf> y
[08:31:03] <|RicharD|> umh
[08:31:19] <|RicharD|> i don't know why in localhost it give me syntax error on doctype
[08:31:51] <enjoycrf> cause ruby?
[08:31:57] <|RicharD|> oki fixed
[08:32:01] <enjoycrf> lol
[08:32:05] <|RicharD|> (i'ts only html :))
[08:32:12] <|RicharD|> anyway
[08:32:14] <jwmann> Does this look wrong?     console.log($("div#f25-favorites-list div#"+$(this).attr('href'))):
[08:32:35] <|RicharD|> not show the next div: $("a.viewall").next("#images-hidden").css('display', 'block');
[08:33:08] <|RicharD|> and in html i have: <p><a href="#" class="viewall">Visualizza tutte le sue immagini</a></p>
[08:33:10] <|RicharD|> 				<div id="images-hidden" style="display: none"
[08:33:41] <michael_mbp> kborchers: what about CORS?
[08:34:04] <kborchers> jwmann: yes, that looks wrong.
[08:34:42] <kborchers> michael_mbp: what do you mean?
[08:34:45] <jwmann> kborchers: I'm getting errors from it, do you see what it is?
[08:34:57] <michael_mbp> json-p.org read the intro to CORS
[08:35:01] <hariom> kborchers: I see that when I click on the link, a dialog appears with the extra html fragment that I pulled using ajax. But some how the base page gets refreshed and dialog disappears in few seconds
[08:35:04] <kborchers> jwmann: what are you tring to do there?
[08:35:14] <|RicharD|> nobody ? :)
[08:35:16] <michael_mbp> cross-origin resource sharing hmm
[08:35:23] <kborchers> ?demo @ hariom
[08:35:23] <bot-t> hariom, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:35:39] <michael_mbp> ah crap
[08:35:56] <michael_mbp> special service handling of the preflight connection
[08:36:10] <michael_mbp> that'll make it nice n' secure.... drat.
[08:36:16] <kborchers> michael_mbp: right
[08:36:26] <austinbv> why is my $.click() not firing when bound to a link?
[08:36:47] <jwmann> kborchers: I'm trying to make a 'specific' selector. I'm basically trying to select this $("div#f25-favorites-list div#foo") where foo changes depending on the $(this)
[08:37:22] <kborchers> ?selectors @ jwmann
[08:37:22] <bot-t> jwmann, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[08:37:25] <kborchers> read that
[08:37:42] <kborchers> i think you are confusing the #(id selector) with the #(hash)
[08:38:09] <|RicharD|> http://jsfiddle.net/ftsym/2/
[08:38:33] <jwmann> kborchers: Maybe, That's how I ususally select an id within jquery =\
[08:39:14] <kborchers> jwmann: right, but then you were trying to append an href to that string i think ... what was that about?
[08:39:14] <DanielSi> hi, I got a problem with jquery ui tabs. perhaps someone can help? I use the callback "select" and then the page loads the link from the tab. If i remove the callback everything works fine. I didn't find anything on the net, but the way how to become the "bug" I got
[08:39:19] <jwmann> kborchers: I'm trying to concatinate $(this).attr('href') with div#f25-favorites-list
[08:39:22] <|RicharD|> please anybody an see here? : http://jsfiddle.net/ftsym/2/
[08:40:04] <kborchers> jwmann: i'm still confused, you are trying to add what exactly to the href?
[08:40:41] <hariom> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/nA3z7/
[08:41:34] <hariom> http://jsfiddle.net/nA3z7/1/
[08:41:47] <jwmann> kborchers: You know how when you select something in css, you can do: div#foo div#bar where div#bar would be inside div#foo.
[08:42:06] <kborchers> jwmann: right
[08:42:41] <jwmann> kborchers: so I have div#foo, which would be inside div#f25-favorites-list
[08:42:55] <kborchers> ok
[08:43:23] <jwmann> kborchers: Which I would normally select in jQuery liuke so: $("div#f25-favorites-list div#foo")
[08:43:57] <jwmann> kborchers: The only difference is that div#foo is relate to what element is being "hovered"
[08:44:03] <joshatjben> |RicharD|: http://jsfiddle.net/joshatjben/ftsym/3/
[08:44:08] <kborchers> ok, which you could just select like $("#foo") since id's are unique. then what do you want to do once you have that div
[08:44:12] <jwmann> kborchers: Which is where $(this) comes in
[08:44:44] <joshatjben>  |RicharD|: using .next() to select an object by ID isn't needed
[08:44:50] <|RicharD|> no
[08:44:55] <jwmann> kborchers: I'm just trying to select it for now
[08:44:57] <|RicharD|> because i have multiple div element
[08:44:59] <|RicharD|> :)
[08:45:01] <|RicharD|> with same id
[08:45:10] <kborchers> |RicharD|: which is wrong!
[08:45:14] <|RicharD|> so i must use next :(
[08:45:18] <|RicharD|> ops i can convert to class
[08:45:20] <|RicharD|> :)
[08:45:22] <jwmann> kborchers: I'm working on a huge project with multiple collaborators so I want to make sure it's truly selecting only that
[08:45:26] <austinbv> if you have a click event bound to an anchor link that is displayed as block do you have to click the text still to fire the event?
[08:45:46] <joshatjben> |RicharD|: i gottcha ;) try this http://jsfiddle.net/joshatjben/ftsym/5/
[08:45:56] <jwmann> kborchers: which is why I want to concatinate the pretense with the div#foo
[08:46:12] <kborchers> jwmann: ok, but even so if more than one element has the same id, you have bigger problems
[08:46:28] <jwmann> kborchers: Yes
[08:46:37] <|RicharD|> joshatjben: no :( http://jsfiddle.net/ftsym/6/
[08:46:46] <|RicharD|> with multiple div it show all
[08:46:48] <jwmann> kborchers: It's highly improbably that will happen; I'm just being thorough
[08:46:53] <|RicharD|> and not only the next
[08:46:58] <joshatjben>  |RicharD|: my fault http://jsfiddle.net/joshatjben/ftsym/7/
[08:47:58] <kborchers> jwmann: that should be unnecessary but anyway ... i still don't understand where the href comes in see ?p
[08:47:58] <bot-t> jwmann, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:48:02] <|RicharD|> work great :9
[08:48:04] <|RicharD|> thx a lot ;)
[08:48:07] <|RicharD|> :)
[08:48:20] <joshatjben> |RicharD|: great! np
[08:51:19] <jwmann> kborchers: I got it working; For some reason I put a colon instead of semi-colon by accident.
[08:51:31] <kborchers> oops
[08:51:34] <jwmann> kborchers: But if you're interested in what I'm trying to do then here ya go http://jsfiddle.net/sBvtM/
[08:54:49] <austinbv> can you not bind a click event to a link?
[08:55:39] <kborchers> austinbv: yes
[08:55:54] <Brodingo> jquery is pretty much like zombo.com
[08:56:40] <austinbv> I must have syntax error I have always bound but for some reason clicks are not working on some links I have displayed as block
[08:57:30] <Brodingo> austinbv if you could post a demo on jsfiddle.net you could get some help
[08:58:27] <austinbv> Brodingo: https://gist.github.com/1186496 I will put it on js fiddle too
[08:59:34] <Brodingo> i think you might need to wrap build_pie_chart() and other in an anonymous function
[08:59:50] <jwmann> Is there a way to output something similar to php's 'print_r'
[08:59:52] <Brodingo> pass the event object, prevent the default action
[08:59:59] <Brodingo> then call your function
[09:00:03] <austinbv> it worked when they wern't styled
[09:00:24] <Brodingo> jwmann console.dir()
[09:00:29] <austinbv> jwmann: console.log
[09:01:34] <Brodingo> jwmann well your click event is going to be binding whatever those functions return
[09:01:51] <Brodingo> sorry, i meant austinbv
[09:02:26] <austinbv> how would it bind to the callback
[09:03:20] <Brodingo> like i said, use an anonymous function
[09:03:32] <austinbv> done
[09:03:40] <austinbv> still no dice
[09:03:46] <Brodingo> $('#bar_graph_button').click(function(e){e.preventDefault();build_bar_graph("d");});
[09:04:39] <jwmann> Brodingo, austinbv both of those return objects
[09:04:57] <Brodingo> what browser jwmann
[09:05:33] <Brodingo> austinbv well a complete demo on jsfiddle.net...
[09:07:05] <jwmann> Brodingo: Chrome
[09:07:13] <jwmann> Brodingo: Developer Tools Console
[09:07:43] <jwmann> Is there a way to for something to output as a string?
[09:07:53] <jwmann> I'm getting some weird bugs
[09:09:08] <jwmann> I'm calling $(this).attr('href') which returns => foo and sometimes foo/bar
[09:09:28] <jwmann> The links with 'foo/bar' don't seem to respond
[09:10:10] <Brodingo> ?demo
[09:10:10] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:11:48] <IanWizard> Hey guys :D
[09:12:48] <Brodingo> sup
[09:13:03] <austinbv> Brodingo: http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/e5SVJ/ and anyone else that cares
[09:13:22] <jwmann> Brodingo: http://jsfiddle.net/sBvtM/1/
[09:13:24] <austinbv> oh hold on I put the coffee in
[09:13:25] <Brodingo> wtf
[09:14:09] <austinbv> rebased Brodingo http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/e5SVJ/#base
[09:14:21] <Brodingo> people when i said demos i meant working demos, you know with like the right libraries and all your code and stuff
[09:14:25] <Brodingo> if you want help dont be lazy
[09:15:39] <austinbv> that is a demo reproducing the problem Brodingo
[09:17:51] <austinbv> what more would you like I will put my full code in there if you would rather
[09:18:24] <|RicharD|> joshatjben: any idea ? http://jsfiddle.net/ftsym/11/
[09:18:41] <|RicharD|> anybody know why don't work the second time ? for hide the dv
[09:18:55] <Brodingo> what im driving at isnt just in this particular circumstance, but if you want someone to help, they need to see all the intricacies of the problem
[09:19:09] <Brodingo> broken down into the simplest form
[09:20:58] <jwmann> Brodingo: Okay here; http://jsfiddle.net/sBvtM/7/ Hover over the links; The links with '/' in them do not work.
[09:22:35] <Brodingo> some lovely tag soup
[09:23:14] <jwmann> tag soup?
[09:23:43] <|RicharD|> when i add a class it not work ith .click function
[09:23:54] <|RicharD|> why i must use .live ?
[09:24:22] <Brodingo> jwmann so if you inspect one of the jquery objects being logged youll see "div#f25-favorites-list div#profiles/add"
[09:25:13] <Brodingo> what are you expecting to select with that
[09:25:54] <jwmann> Well as you can see it works with the ones without a /
[09:25:57] <austinbv> Brodingo: that's what I think that fork the simplest form of the problem being reproduced
[09:26:06] <jwmann> I'm expecting to work just like the rest of them
[09:27:57] <Brodingo> not sure having slashes in ids is smart
[09:28:52] <Brodingo> maybe use data-* or something
[09:28:59] <lith> Hey guys, is there a util method in jqm that re-iterates a part of the dom to load data-roles and other jqm attributes? The reason i ask is i want to add links to the dom after a page has been loaded and want to re-init the header so it changes those links into jqm buttons
[09:29:06] <kinga> can some1 help me with a "simple" error ?
[09:29:11] <kinga> http://pastebin.com/Q6cgVf8Q
[09:29:22] <kinga> here's the paste...it's a short one, yet i dont know what's causing it
[09:29:35] <Brodingo> jwmann yeah only use alphanumeric characters for ids
[09:29:57] <jwmann> Brodingo: Yea, I was definitely trying to avoid it
[09:30:15] <Brodingo> ?livequery @ lith
[09:30:16] <bot-t> lith, Plugins/livequery - Live Query utilizes the power of jQuery selectors by binding events or firing callbacks for matched elements auto-magically, even after the page has been loaded and the DOM updated. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[09:30:48] <lith> kinga: storedParticipants isnt defined
[09:31:00] <kinga> var storedParticipants;
[09:31:00] <Brodingo> lith or really if you know when/ if you control the updates just use a callback
[09:31:01] <kinga> it is
[09:31:05] <kinga> i didnt include it in the paste
[09:31:28] <lith> kinga: no, thats the problem hehe not taht it wasnt included in your pastebin
[09:31:54] <lith> kinga: console.log(storedParticipants) in your each iteration and you'll see that it is undefined
[09:32:04] <Brodingo> this.id.slice(4) ?
[09:32:15] <kinga> ok
[09:32:27] <kinga> var storedParticipants = new Array();
[09:32:31] <kinga> is this better? :P
[09:33:07] <lith> kinga: i dunno, does it work now?
[09:33:33] <kinga> yea, it works.... i don't get the error now
[09:33:34] <kinga> thanks
[09:34:16] <austinbv> Brodingo: it was a caching issue
[09:34:19] <austinbv> sorry for the hassle
[09:34:24] <kinga> if i don't specify which data type is the variable, shouldn't the browser automatically assign it a type when i'm giving it a value ?
[09:34:30] <Brodingo> shit was so cache
[09:34:38] <kinga> like when i'm doing var string; string = 'text';
[09:34:41] <lith> kings hehe its not PHP
[09:35:07] <kinga> ok...and since i'm here
[09:35:11] <kinga> i have a nother question
[09:35:20] <kinga> that storedParticipants is an array in javascript
[09:35:38] <kinga> if i pass it through POST with ajax will it be an array in php as well ?
[09:35:50] <falsefalse> kinga, var storedParticipants = [] is better :)
[09:35:51] <kinga> i haven't had too many occasions to pass arrays through get/post
[09:35:53] <lith> kinga: depends on how you pass it
[09:35:58] <lith> falsefasle: why?
[09:36:06] <austinbv> safari pisses me off some times with cache
[09:36:20] <lith> falsefalse: why is var array = []; better than var array = new Array(); ?
[09:36:27] <kinga> the data from ajax() is like this
[09:36:29] <kinga> 'action=assign&helper='+selectedHelper+'&participants='+storedParticipants
[09:37:08] <falsefalse> lith, because it works little faster, looks way more cleaner, and most important, doesn't look as PHP :p
[09:37:53] <falsefalse> kinga, you probably want to JSON.serialize(yourArray), send it, and serialize it back in PHP
[09:38:07] <|RicharD|> https://gist.github.com/1186602
[09:38:20] <|RicharD|> why it not imposte the .css ?
[09:38:24] <|RicharD|> the first time all oki
[09:38:35] <|RicharD|> but when i want hide it...it not work :S
[09:38:41] <kinga> do i have to convert those parameters into a json string?
[09:38:57] <kinga> isn't it faster if i use a plain text instead of a json string ?
[09:39:00] <s34n> .post() adds an additional parameter to its post. How do I suppress that parameter?
[09:39:04] <lith> falsefalse: but if i do something like this MyObj.prototype = { myArray:[], init:functino(){ this.myArray.push('asdf'); }} that will not work defining it as [], i have to use new Array(); in the init fucntion
[09:39:40] <lith> so i've stopped using var myArray = [];
[09:40:18] <lith> kinga: Do you now? you can pass arrays through post / get
[09:40:31] <kinga> i know
[09:40:35] <danzik17> lith: That doesn't make any sense - can you fiddle the case you're saying doesn't work?
[09:40:49] <kinga> but is the correct way ? i pasted my string
[09:40:54] <mosdef100200> Hi there thought id try my luck here has anyone used bumpbox (which is a type of lightbox) i need some advice with setting classes

[09:45:56] <kinga> lith, is it ok :-s ?
[09:46:25] <s34n> oops. it isn't .post() that is adding the extra param. it looks like the transform plugin
[09:47:48] <falsefalse> lith, actually, it works fine with literal http://jsfiddle.net/false/j825J/1/ ; there is no difference btw array literal and array constructor syntactically wise
[09:50:47] <Baribal> I'm setting the selected option of a sorting box this way: $("#select_sorting").val(sorting_mode); but that doesn't seem to throw a change event. Is there a way to do that, or is there a better way to set the value, or a more direct way to get the currently selected value than event.target.value?
[09:50:49] <falsefalse> lith, and array literal is indeed faster, http://jsperf.com/new-array-v-literal, sooo please back up your claim with something
[09:54:02] <austinbv> how do you do a full fresh reboot in lion
[09:54:17] <austinbv> so windows dont come up and everything restarts fresh
[09:54:48] <danzik17> falsefalse: Hah wow, I knew literal was faster, but I wouldn't have guessed that it was almost 100% faster in Chrome
[09:56:45] <falsefalse> danzik17, well, 'new' operator is defintely expensive stuff when compared to just a literal, all that context/scope/invoke a func costs something, while literal costs effectively nothing. and literal looks waaaaay better :)
[09:57:22] <falsefalse> * s/is/does/
[09:58:36] <lith> falsefalse: huh, i just made a test and it does not break the way i said? Now I'm confused why it didnt work the 1st time i tried it like that

[10:00:08] <hariom> How to show background image in a div with opacity very low (so that the actual content in div can be seen properly)?
[10:01:00] <Brodingo> opacity takes precedent
[10:01:09] <FunnyLookinHat> If I serialize() a bunch of form fields and want to post them, is there a way to get them to be sent in the same fashion as regular post data?  i.e. $.post() such that my PHP could read them as $_POST['field1'] etc. etc. ?
[10:01:15] <falsefalse> lith, yay, you're back on the correct path :)
[10:01:41] <lith> hariom: well its a thing? You can do this though? make 3 divs, 1st div is bg image, 2nd div is solid color bg w opacity 85% 3rd div has content? but content will inherit the 85% opacity
[10:02:30] <Brodingo> and consider rgba()
[10:03:19] <kborchers> FunnyLookinHat: if you pass that serialized string as the data param in post, it does just that

[10:05:00] <s34n> zephir: hi
[10:05:07] <lith> hariom: maybe 90% - 95%? but the less opaque you make it the less opaque you make your content? if that makes sense? unless there is some other kind of hackery to do it, thats how i've solved that in the past
[10:05:43] <hariom> ok

[10:55:34] <TeddyMurray> for instance
[10:55:43] <jonclark> kborchers, that works. iirc i haven't used before, and jquery has been able to tell it's JSON
[10:55:45] <jonclark> maybe i'm trippin
[10:55:55] <jonclark> thanks though :)
[10:55:56] <TeddyMurray> which doesnt work

[10:56:18] <hex``> DAMNNNNNN falsefalse! lol
[10:56:21] <hex``> ty
[10:57:06] <kborchers> jonclark: if your server side code doesn't tell the client that JSON is coming it makes a best guess, and in this case must have guessed it was just text
[10:58:53] <jonclark> kborchers, ok, cool, i'll take a look at what i may have changed in my php
[10:59:27] <kborchers> jonclark: not sure but it may also have something to do with post() but that's just a guess
[11:00:12] <tash> ngharo: thanks, that worked
[11:01:10] <jonclark> kborchers, hmm, tried explicitly setting the datatype, still no dice -- likely server-side. thanks :)
[11:01:10] <Dave_Stein> why am i getting too much recursion? var x = $('<div></div>').tmpl({a:1})

[11:03:27] <kborchers> jonclark: yeah, i guess i could have been a little more specific in saying the server needs to "tell the client it's JSON" ;)

[11:05:14] <|RicharD|> work the view div
[11:05:20] <|RicharD|> but then if i want hidden it NO
[11:05:29] <Dave_Stein> oh im an asshole thats why it waasnt working
[11:05:30] <madprops> how about making everything inside $(currentTab) to show?
[11:05:51] <jonclark> madprops, instead of find('div'), do children()
[11:05:59] <madprops> aight
[11:06:02] <jonclark> word
[11:06:16] <kborchers> |RicharD|: your else if will never happen since anything inside that function will have the viewall class
[11:06:35] <|RicharD|> ?
[11:06:41] <|RicharD|> but when i click it remove the class
[11:06:43] <|RicharD|> and add another
[11:07:35] <|RicharD|> so then i have the new class...but i think that it not view it on livei don't know
[11:08:44] <hex``> Why the DEBUG MESSAGE 1 shows up but the MESSAGE 2 doesn't? http://jsfiddle.net/8HQTr/2/

[11:12:13] <|RicharD|> kborchers: any suggest please ?
[11:12:21] <kborchers> hex``: well, you have an error since fieldValue is undefined
[11:12:52] <kborchers> |RicharD|: i would need to see a working demo to help see ?demo
[11:12:52] <bot-t> |RicharD|, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:13:01] <|RicharD|> yes sure
[11:13:12] <hex``> kborchers I've read somewhere that fieldValue gets the value of the input

[11:14:03] <|RicharD|> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/ftsym/12/ i want that return to hide div then
[11:14:08] <hex``> oh well, fieldValue is used with jquery-form.js... now I see... thanks kborchers
[11:14:15] <kborchers> np
[11:14:15] <|RicharD|> i show it...and then i want hide it
[11:14:52] <Aragoid> beginner question: how can I show <li> elements of a specific hierarchy? (as in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7273248/simple-interactive-html-lists-with-jquery)
[11:18:31] <kborchers> |RicharD|: do you need to use live there? the problem is live binds to window i believe and waits for the event to bubble of from an element that matches the selector. since you are removing the class, it no longer works. using bind instead and display none not hide works http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/ftsym/13/
[11:19:11] <|RicharD|> oh great!
[11:19:23] <|RicharD|> so
[11:19:24] <DevBrPb> hi to all
[11:19:33] <|RicharD|> .live() attach to the content of the moment ?
[11:19:53] <kborchers> ?live @ |RicharD|

[11:20:15] <poppiez> I'm trying to implement the jquery form plugin. while this works great in most browsers, firefox is making trouble. when I set the dataType to json, I keep getting state = uninitialized, while the other browsers gives me state = complete. anyone with similar issue?
[11:20:16] <|RicharD|> oh oki :)
[11:20:23] <|RicharD|> kborchers: thx very much!
[11:20:33] <kborchers> np
[11:21:00] <|RicharD|> ;).
[11:21:24] <DevBrPb> with jquery i can find and show specific li that have a text, for sample a same <li> and a one have a content that i want extract
[11:22:30] <danzik17> |RicharD|: You can also just use delegate and add a selector for the class you're toggling:  http://jsfiddle.net/ftsym/15/
[11:22:52] <|RicharD|> i see more simple .bind()
[11:23:11] <hex``> I'm returning false always when the form should not continue the submition, however it is not working. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/8HQTr/3/
[11:23:20] <kborchers> danzik17: yeah, but why add the overhead of delegate if he just needs to bind since the elements are being added later?
[11:23:30] <kborchers> aren't*
[11:23:56] <danzik17> kborchers: Agreed, just saying that it could work with the right selector as he had it
[11:24:03] <kborchers> gotcha
[11:25:23] <hex``> I'm returning false always when the form should not continue the submition, however it is not working. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/8HQTr/3/
[11:26:30] <kborchers> hex``: because you are returning false to nothing. you need to pass a reference to the function to submit, not just call it. http://jsfiddle.net/8HQTr/3/
[11:27:23] <hex``> $(document).ready(function() {$('form#boleto').submit(function(){
[11:27:23] <hex``> 		return validacao();
[11:27:25] <hex``> like this?
[11:27:48] <kborchers> hex``: i guess you could do that as well but why not like my example?
[11:28:39] <hex``> the link you sent me is the same as mine, I suppose you missed to Update? :)

[11:31:49] <eirikb> Hello. Is it possible to view all events that are binded to an element?
[11:42:31] <eirikb> Is there any way to see a clickevent when it is binded to an element? I have tried profiling in webkit dev tools, but without any luck
[11:48:29] <mehale> whats the proper way to select $(document) and $(´h1´) at once?
[11:48:52] <mehale> I tried $(document, ´h1´) but it doesnt work
[11:49:14] <ajpiano> i would just do $(document).add("h1");
[11:49:21] <eirikb> mehale: Wouldnt that mean selecting 'h1' under document?
[11:49:30] <mehale> eirikb: no.
[11:49:45] <mehale> I am using hotkey, so I need to do both, even if it sounds redundant
[11:51:32] <eirikb> mehale: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/306583/this-selector-and-children/306904#306904
[11:52:42] <mdunham918_> man this blows i have a page script that needs to do .width() and .position() in document ready yet it only works if i put it in a setTimeout and tell it to wait so long before running or i get random numbers like the page hasn't loaded so it can't figure it out
[11:52:57] <eirikb> Would be other way around if it would be as I said, but comma separation should do what I said. So $('b', '<a><b>test</b><a>').text() would be test
[11:53:33] <eirikb> So in theory you would be looking for document under 'h1', but since document is typeof object I'm not sure how it would react
[11:53:34] <mdunham918_> is there a way around that because i can't wait until unload to fire this it needs to be instant this is the page in question http://www.geektestbox.com/devfiles/mdunham/worldtravel/ mouse over the keep refreshing you'll see the arrow under the first menu item is sometimes dead center and sometimes now
[11:54:25] <saml> hey, in an <input>, I want to prevent users from entering certain characters. how do I do that?
[11:55:20] <dxtr> i'm not sure how reliable that would be
[11:55:24] <mdunham918_> sorry for that horrible message lol the problem is i want jQuery to move the arrow dead center of the active menu item you'll see on that link i set a red arrow under the first menu item and if you hit refresh sometimes it will be dead center sometimes not and thats only because i have it in a setTimeout(, 200); if i didn't it would never be right
[11:55:30] <danzik17> eirikb: Seems to ignore the context in that case. http://jsfiddle.net/jy6fb/
[11:55:36] <saml> i do have serverside validation.. it's just for convenience for users
[11:55:41] <mehale> eirikb: I am trying:  $(document, 'table#log thead input').bind('keydown'.....
[11:55:45] <mehale> but it wont work
[11:55:49] <JesperA> http://i.imgur.com/5pXPI.jpg
[11:56:29] <eirikb> mehale: As I said, I don't know how it would react. But most likely as danzik17 shows us. In any way it would not be anything what you want
[11:56:29] <danzik17> mehale: $(document).add('table#log thead input').bind('keydown'.....
[11:57:01] <eirikb> mehale: What danzik17 just said would probably work, as ajpiano pointed out to you early
[11:57:16] <mdunham918_> to simplify why is .width() unreliable in a document ready
[11:57:23] <mehale> indeed, thanks ajpiano & danzik17
[11:57:39] <devinrolsen> define "unreliable".
[11:58:04] <eirikb> mdunham918_: Because the rendering engine might not be done rendering, so the exact size of the element is unknown?
[11:58:21] <mdunham918_> well then why does it return a random number
[11:58:31] <mdunham918_> so i can only get .width() after onload?
[11:58:41] <mdunham918_> or is there a real ready() function that works?
[11:58:54] <ajpiano> mdunham918_: are you trying to get a width of something with images or whatnot
[11:58:58] <mdunham918_> no
[11:59:05] <mdunham918_> just the width of an LI
[11:59:08] <eirikb> I would put my money on onload, it's in most case images (but they affect other things)
[11:59:14] <mdunham918_> it contains an A with display block
[11:59:29] <mdunham918_> no images affecting this
[11:59:36] <mdunham918_> my js is at the bottom of my page as well
[11:59:43] <mdunham918_> and my css is at the top
[11:59:45] <IgnisDiabolus> .load
[12:00:02] <saml> hey $('input').change  is the right one for keyboard input event?
[12:00:04] <IgnisDiabolus> btw, that's the only workaround, to set a timout
[12:00:05] <mdunham918_> is .load the same as unload because onload is slow
[12:00:15] <mdunham918_> lame....
[12:00:27] <IgnisDiabolus> tell that to the browser devs
[12:00:46] <mdunham918_> is there really no way for jQuery to know when its truly ready
[12:01:38] <ajpiano> mdunham918_: how do you figure that it's not getting the actual widths, etc
[12:01:50] <ajpiano> if it's not calculating the width properly of an element that isn't an image on ready, that's a bug
[12:02:11] <mdunham918_> if you go here http://www.geektestbox.com/devfiles/mdunham/worldtravel/ and hit refresh many times sometimes you'll see the arrow dead center sometimes not
[12:02:21] <mdunham918_> and thats all from .width() and .position()
[12:05:16] <monokrome> Is anyone here familiar with SlickGrid?
[12:05:45] <ajpiano> mdunham918_: i'm refreshing the crap out of it, seeing 1500 in the console every time

[12:07:39] <kbotnen> hi. I have a question about saving dom elements for later render. I have a <container>stuff nested inside</container> on a page, when people click, I want to save the container to a variable and render it on the page that loads after the click. is this doable? Anyone have searchterm I can use for searching a solution?
[12:08:47] <ajpiano> kbotnen: var foo = $("#bar");
[12:08:56] <ajpiano> boom now you have a reference to the elements that you can use later
[12:09:06] <kbotnen> just that easy?
[12:09:37] <ajpiano> kbotnen: first you have to fight a dragon
[12:09:41] <kbotnen> I cant use references since a new page is coming up, I need the elements itself. but Ill try the line you provided :)
[12:10:00] <kbotnen> oh. ofc. the dragon. there is always a dragon :)
[12:10:02] <ajpiano> mdunham918_: i see it being inconsistent here and there
[12:10:17] <ajpiano> you probably should distill it down to a smaller case where you can get it to repro every time

[12:27:05] <pjp> Hi, is there an example of file upload form using jquery ?
[12:29:15] <DeRoSvOs> Hey gang.  I'm using a mix of "tablesorter" (http://tablesorter.com/docs/) and have a problem.  Not sure if someone can help me with this.  Basically, I am using it and it works, but, my "table striping" class makes it so that when I click to sort, the striping doesn't last long.  Any idea how to make that strping occur when I sort as well as on the load?
[12:29:58] <DeRoSvOs> Basically, on load everything is cool.  The table is striped in two colors.  When I click on a column name, the tablesorter happens, but, the stiping is not maintained.
[12:30:43] <ajpiano> DeRoSvOs, i believe tablesorter comes with a "zebra" widget
[12:30:52] <ajpiano> which makes it automatically retain striping like that
[12:30:57] <DeRoSvOs> ajpiano: Hmmm.  Ok, let me see.
[12:31:08] <ajpiano> $("foo").tablesorter({ widgets:["zebra"] });
[12:31:14] <ajpiano> i think that works if you have classes like 'odd' and 'even'
[12:35:56] <DeRoSvOs> ajpiano: Thanks man!  That did the trick. :)  I just had to change my .alt class to .odd and it all started to give me love.
[12:35:58] <DeRoSvOs> :D

[12:43:23] <bamccaig> jQuery("input[type=checkbox]"]).button(); // <-- Which event should be used to handle the checkbox button's state changing?
[12:43:27] <bamccaig> event(s)
[12:44:21] <bamccaig> The change() event works fine if you just click the button normally, but if you double-click it then it's visible state still changes, but the change event either doesn't or the checkbox's checked state doesn't change.
[12:50:49] <Haprog> http://code.google.com/p/gag/
[12:57:29] <bamccaig> It seems to me that the code that implements the button() for a checkbox isn't checking the actual checkbox state, but trying to track it itself. Which doesn't sync up fully. :\
[12:58:05] <bamccaig> I guess jQuery UI..
[13:13:30] <Ankabout> $("menu-389 a").click(function(b){ b.preventDefault(); });
[13:13:42] <Ankabout> that should make nothing happen when I click the link right/
[13:14:17] <ajpiano> Ankabout: assuming your selector was correct, which it definitely isn't
[13:14:28] <kborchers> Ankabout: not nothing, it will not perform it's default function but the event will still bubble and trigger any click events bound to ancestor elements
[13:14:31] <Ankabout> uhm, there was a . there
[13:15:44] <Ankabout> kborchers, hi!
[13:15:49] <kborchers> yo
[13:16:01] <Ankabout> that scrolling thing you helped me with works ALMOST perfectly
[13:16:06] <kborchers> cool
[13:16:08] <Ankabout> eh no wait, it works perfectly haha
[13:16:19] <kborchers> even cooler ;)

[13:19:05] <Ankabout> I'm trying to prevent the 'commissioned' link from doing anything
[13:19:21] <Kikketer> I've tried .bind("select", function() {   or .bind("autocompleteselect",
[13:19:28] <Kikketer> none of which seem to work
[13:19:55] <kborchers> Ankabout: works fine when you actually include jQuery ;) http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/YGwSp/1/
[13:19:58] <ravenzz> Ankabout you need to Choose jquery
[13:20:00] <Kikketer> i see within the combobox.js the select function on the autocomplete fires a "selected" event
[13:20:15] <Ankabout> oh yeah....
[13:20:30] <Ankabout> ravenzz, kborchers, thanks... so why's it not working on my site then... hmmm
[13:20:31] <Kikketer> .bind("selected", function.... doesn't work either
[13:20:52] <Kikketer> I am putting the .bind on the original combobox
[13:21:36] <Kikketer> And the selector is actually retrieving more than one (just doing a id^=something) but that shouldn't make a difference

[13:23:41] <AfroTurf> $.ajax is stripping out any <script> tags i have. when i look at the response it's in there, just not in the dom
[13:24:01] <Ankabout> ah ok, then it's ok. just trying to figure out why the code works perfectly in the fiddle but not on my site

[13:52:15] <madprops> can i do something like this? $("#tab1"+(numtabs+1))
[13:52:31] <ajpiano> Andrea_789564324: that param is typically added by jQuery when you do cache: false
[13:52:32] <jwmann> Andrea_789564324: It might have to do with ajaxrequest.php ?
[13:52:37] <Kikketer> $("select[id^=tskAssignUser]").change(function() { alert("blar"); });
[13:52:37] <Kikketer> Works just fine on the standard original dropdown box

[13:58:04] <Kikketer> A breakpoint within the "select: function()" within the combobox.js reviels the event.type = "autocompleteselect"
[13:58:31] <Kikketer> It then runs the self._trigger("selected", event...
[13:58:33] <jwmann> ;D
[13:59:02] <jwmann> Brodingo: When you roll over the links, you'll see what I mean
[13:59:21] <Brodingo> they seem to be animating
[13:59:45] <jwmann> Brodingo: The intended function is to roller over the link which will display the box and then mouse out and the box will dissappear
[13:59:54] <jwmann> Brodingo: The animation works, but it's glitchy
[14:00:24] <jwmann> Brodingo: It sometimes shows then hides then shows then hides then shows and then stays shown.
[14:00:45] <jwmann> Brodingo: All while not moving the mouse on the link
[14:00:53] <Kikketer> Brodingo: $("select[id^=tskAssignUser]").bind("autocompletechange", function() { alert("auto!"); });  does not work, the alert is never presented, while doing a .bind("change") works fine on the original dropdown so the bind syntax is correct
[14:01:30] <Brodingo> well you need to make sure the animation queue doesnt stack up like that and consider that the element is blocking the mouse event
[14:02:06] <jwmann> Brodingo: I'm not quite sure I fully understand; Could you go a bit further into detail?
[14:03:35] <Brodingo> if youre pressing a button which makes an axe cut off your hand, are you still pressing the button?
[14:03:57] <Brodingo> thats deep
[14:04:02] <jwmann> Brodingo: I see your point.
[14:04:36] <jwmann> Brodingo: The element that's hiding and showing doesn't really overlap the element
[14:05:24] <jwmann> Brodingo: Ohhh I see what's wrong
[14:05:27] <Brodingo> also, its hard as shit to debug this bitch cause your html is an amorphous blob
[14:05:46] <Brodingo> everything is like over qualified
[14:05:49] <jwmann> Brodingo: Sorry about that; I had to copy and paste the rendered html because I generating this with php
[14:05:57] <Brodingo> hmmm
[14:06:19] <jwmann> drupal to be exact
[14:06:24] <Brodingo> well its hard to make a piece of shit smell like roses
[14:06:43] <jwmann> Brodingo: Haha, I freaking hate drupal
[14:07:02] <Brodingo> and yeah, i gathered, im a themer
[14:08:17] <jwmann> Brodingo: I know what the problem is now. When I hover over the element; the animation starts but the element that shows- animates right underneath the element; which causes it to 'leave' the previous element and then it keeps going which would then enter the element once again.
[14:08:28] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[14:09:09] <jwmann> So it's the animating element itself which cause it to leave and enter a thousand times
[14:09:37] <jwmann> Brodingo: If you go to my demo and hover over my menu on the far right; the animations work perfectly as intended.
[14:09:47] <Brodingo> if you can bind the event to the popup too it could work

[14:23:10] <jdevel> yea, once I wrap up some more marketing material for a couple clients I can get back and finish it
[14:23:37] <jdevel> got a flood of marketing requests for the US holiday
[14:23:48] <jdevel> so clearing that crap out now
[14:25:00] <jdevel> well basically it will take all the elements inside the container and set them up to iterate through them, allows adding of your own controls etc.
[14:25:08] <jdevel> going to be reasonably basic
[14:25:23] <jdevel> once that's all set perhaps I'll start to add some effects etc
[14:25:29] <jdevel> for transitions and such
[14:25:54] <jdevel> but should be really small, no additional css file, and should be straight forward for the most part
[14:26:34] <jdevel> I hate adding horribly bloated files just for a simple thing such as what your looking for.
[14:27:30] <jdevel> takes care of all the default values and allows you to override them with your own.  coded to spec w/ the contribution guide lines
[14:27:58] <jdevel> collision prevention etc..

[14:33:22] <Martin_> a graph library
[14:33:40] <geekbuntu> no, but has an interesting name
[14:34:09] <geekbuntu> what's the problem?
[14:35:58] <Martin_> I was just wondering what you guys thought to it and the alternatives
[14:36:17] <geekbuntu> Martin_, i'm looking through the examples
[14:36:26] <Jayflux> Martin_ yes
[14:36:26] <geekbuntu> it's 2d/very easy to follow
[14:36:38] <Jayflux> been using it for weeks now and i still never get the result i aim for
[14:36:45] <Jayflux> stay away while you still can!!
[14:37:49] <Martin_> Jayflux: heheh - I love the graphs it produces... having some weird issues though
[14:37:56] <Martin_> i can't get plothover to trigger, for example
[14:38:08] <Jayflux> right
[14:38:12] <Jayflux> should be easy
[14:38:16] <Jayflux> where's you code
[14:38:49] <Martin_> sec
[14:39:47] <Martin_> forgot hoverable:true ;)
[14:40:01] <Jayflux> ;)
[14:40:37] <Martin_> why does it never give you the correct result, Jayflux ?
[14:41:00] <Jayflux> ah long story Martin_ its actually nothing to do with flot now its more the mathematics behind it
[14:41:10] <Jayflux> behind what we're trying to do
[14:41:16] <Jayflux> so at the moment im not blaming flot
[14:41:22] <Jayflux> flot is currently doing its job
[14:41:46] <leotr> so is there something like beforeDelete event handler in jQuery?
[14:41:59] <Jayflux> Martin_ when doing an area chart i was suprised there was no option to have the areas stacked
[14:42:14] <Jayflux> thats what annoyed me ^^ stacking only works properly on bar charts
[14:42:16] <Martin_> yeah, but there is a stacked plugin now
[14:42:18] <tash> is it obvious to anyone why my if() isn't working like I want it to?  It works when the password is under 5 characters, but not over 13. http://pastie.org/2467803
[14:42:24] <Martin_> i think at least...
[14:42:38] <Jayflux> yeah Martin_ i tried it, it doesnt work on area charts
[14:42:54] <Jayflux> i even emailed lars (the guy who made flot) about it and he said there is no current fix
[14:43:15] <Martin_> damn
[14:43:19] <Martin_> you wanna see one of the pages I made with flot?
[14:43:42] <jdevel> sure
[14:43:48] <Jayflux> Martin_ this is what im talking about http://goo.gl/iILo1
[14:43:57] <Jayflux> i had to manually have the areas sit on top of each other
[14:44:02] <postmodern> what is a good polling plugin for jQuery
[14:44:20] <postmodern> i tried periodicalupdater, but it does not handle multiple updater instances very well
[14:44:22] <Martin_> damn very cool Jayflux !
[14:44:38] <Jayflux> Thanks, it took a while to get there
[14:45:09] <Martin_> that's a very nice application for flot, mine are just for displaying data
[14:45:47] <withate> tash, what ur saying is (if less than 5 OR more than 13
[14:45:51] <Jayflux> Martin_ looks good! i've not messed around with it for stuff like that
[14:46:22] <tash> withate: yes, I want it to be OR, not AND
[14:46:52] <withate> try it this way
[14:46:53] <Jayflux> Martin_ flot is a really good tool, just doesnt have enough people / community behind it which is a shame. If you have any problems I find Ole Laursen usually always replies to emails
[14:46:58] <tash> for testing though, I made it if ( pass_length > 13 ) { // do stuff }  and that didn't work
[14:47:22] <tash> and, I did this too: console.log( (pass_length > 13) ); and it was false until I typed 14 characters in the password field
[14:47:30] <withate> if ((len < 5) || (len > 13)) { document.write("bad len"); }
[14:47:41] <tash> k sec
[14:47:55] <withate> cuz ur missing brackets
[14:47:59] <withate> and it looks like it is
[14:48:09] <Martin_> Jayflux: cool I'll keep that in mind
[14:48:46] <withate> (len < 5) OR (len > 13). if ur len is 13, then the expression becomes False OR False, and else bit is executed
[14:49:12] <beakerman> what is the best practice way to override the .html() or .append() function? I want to "automagically" call innerShiv on any html produce with those jQuery funcs
[14:49:14] <withate> or well vany value from [5;13]
[14:49:48] <tash> withate: your first example didn't work ... it only worked with it was < 5 but not > 13
[14:51:38] <withate> do it this way then... if ((len > 4) && (len < 14)) { true_instructions(); } else { false_instructions() }
[14:52:11] <jgspratt> what kind of function can I use to display a part of a page only after someone has selected a certain option?
[14:52:17] <withate> <...>_instructions(); } else { false_instructions(); }
[14:53:34] <withate> jgspratt, $('#certainID').click(function() { $(div#divID).show(); });
[14:53:35] <jgspratt> for example, if I had a drop down menu and option 1 was selected, I would want to show a bunch of stuff
[14:54:59] <tash> withate: negatory
[14:55:00] <tash> sigh
[14:55:04] <tash> will keep messin' with it
[14:55:24] <withate> tash
[14:55:29] <withate> cant b that man..
[14:55:34] <withate> the logic is correct.
[15:05:05] <Tcalp> is there a good firefox plugin or similar to help debug javascript / jquery ?
[15:06:08] <ajpiano> ?g firequery
[15:06:09] <bot-t> ajpiano, FireQuery is a Firebug extension for jQuery development - http://firequery.binaryage.com/
[15:07:18] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: why do i feel like this code sucks? or is that the right way to do what i'm doing?
[15:07:20] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/Ac2SK/
[15:07:51] <ajpiano> i'll tell you when it loads
[15:08:16] <Dave_Stein> loaded fast here, i hope it's not slow the day i'm gonna be using fiddles during a demonstration
[15:08:33] <ajpiano> naw the internet here sucks bawlz
[15:08:37] <Dave_Stein> ah
[15:08:49] <NS|Glock_Coma> does jQUery.ajax wait for on document ready before executing?
[15:09:13] <NS|Glock_Coma> nvm
[15:09:15] <NS|Glock_Coma> ignore my question
[15:09:15] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: can you throw it on a differnt PB, i can't see
[15:09:19] <ajpiano> i mean get there
[15:09:20] <NS|Glock_Coma> i'm sleepy and forgot i ran a test on this already
[15:09:40] <NS|Glock_Coma> i'm trying to speed up the time it takes to do a jsonp request
[15:09:52] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/QYcFNseY
[15:10:07] <NS|Glock_Coma> and even a really small tight script that is barebones jsonp takes the browser 60-100ms to execute on
[15:10:16] <NS|Glock_Coma> i think it's the way jsonp works via the script tag embed
[15:10:23] <NS|Glock_Coma> trying to figure out how i can speed that up
[15:10:32] <devinrolsen> afternoon all
[15:10:37] <ajpiano> wow i can't get ANYWHERE argh
[15:10:47] <Dave_Stein> damn

[15:11:49] <ajpiano> dave is a goodguy :)
[15:11:50] <devinrolsen> thx ajpiano
[15:11:57] <ajpiano> just trying to stop the floodwaters for a sec
[15:12:16] <gnarf> ?p @Dave_Stein
[15:12:17] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:12:21] <gnarf> :)
[15:12:27] <Dave_Stein> crap sorry about that
[15:12:31] <Dave_Stein> only pasted since aj couldnt get to pastebin
[15:12:33] <ajpiano> my internet is just crapped up so i can't view his pastebins
[15:12:37] <ajpiano> yea that's a bad reason :p
[15:13:03] <snover> ajpiano couldn’t see my nudes either so I had to paste them in IRC too!
[15:13:17] <snover> what a small world.
[15:13:20] <Dave_Stein> haha
[15:13:35] <merlin1991> does that mean you share nudes?
[15:13:39] <ajpiano> ascii nudes
[15:13:40] <ajpiano> ftw
[15:13:44] <snover> 8=======D
[15:13:57] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: aside from not working on undefined/non-object shit, that doesn't seem so bad... however you really prolly don't need the closure created by each either
[15:14:09] <enjoycrf> snover ur a dick
[15:14:15] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: thanks
[15:14:20] <Dave_Stein> look what i've started *sigh*
[15:14:23] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: for( x=0; x<parts.length; x++ ) { } might be better than an each
[15:14:37] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: yeah i'll do some checking within it, but the principle is good yeah?
[15:14:40] <stewie`> how come this always return an empty string?? $(xml).find("tagTest").text();
[15:14:45] <gnarf> ?js peen(10)
[15:14:46] <bot-t> gnarf: "8==========D"
[15:14:47] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: yeah ill get rid of closure
[15:14:49] <gnarf> ?js ajpiano()
[15:14:50] <bot-t> gnarf: "8=D"
[15:14:59] <enjoycrf> hahaha
[15:15:12] <enjoycrf> ajpiano is cool
[15:15:22] * gnarf nods
[15:15:33] <enjoycrf> snover == 8D
[15:15:38] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano; i wonder how slow your net is that you thought my messages were still coming when you blocked me ;)
[15:15:41] <enjoycrf> 1 inch peen
[15:15:49] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: they were
[15:15:50] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: it's not slow so much as just weird and glitchy DNS crap
[15:15:52] <ajpiano> at my office
[15:16:03] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: your irc client slows down the flood
[15:16:10] <gnarf> or you woulda been booted from IRC if it hadn't
[15:16:12] <gnarf> by a server
[15:16:12] <Dave_Stein> well now i know what that indicator is on the bottom right when it went from green to red
[15:16:29] <gnarf> you had just said "$.each" when he quieted you
[15:16:47] <Dave_Stein> ohhh
[15:16:47] <Dave_Stein> got it
[15:17:03] <Dave_Stein> ifi  knew it would do that i wouldnt have pasted at all, didnt realize it made that much pain
[15:17:29] <beakerman> how do you extend jQuery's base functions? I want to add extra functionality to $.html
[15:17:30] <stewie`> can someone please help and tell me why it's always returning an empty string: http://jsfiddle.net/Ua2sh/
[15:17:32] <gnarf> Well, you just pasted like 20 lines to 842 people you weren't talking to :)
[15:17:40] <Dave_Stein> good point
[15:18:01] <ajpiano> beakerman: paulirish.com/2010/duck-punching-with-jquery/
[15:18:16] <gnarf> ajpiano: nice article
[15:18:20] <gnarf> ++
[15:18:46] <beakerman> ajpiano: thanks, you rule
[15:18:49] <stewie`> ajpiano: you mind helping?
[15:19:07] <ajpiano> stewie`: jquery can't directly parse an xml string in $( )
[15:19:13] <ajpiano> throw it through see ?parseXML
[15:19:14] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery.parseXML() - Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[15:19:23] <ajpiano> and then you can do your jay queries on it
[15:19:52] <gnarf> yay Queries!
[15:20:42] * gnarf disappears - bbl
[15:32:49] <beakerman> is it possible to extend .html or .append?
[15:33:06] <beakerman> it's not listed in the API as jQuery.html(), but just .html()
[15:35:15] <ajpiano> beakerman: jQuery.fn.html
[15:35:32] <beakerman> thanks again, just got it working as you send that
[15:35:36] <beakerman> sent that*
[15:37:37] <webguynow> I wondered if I can get a quick review on this article (not mine), but informative on r/t jQuery validation
[15:37:41] <webguynow> http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/tutorials/building-real-time-form-validation-using-jquery/
[15:38:12] <webguynow> I found it wierd that they use a `mything'  syntax (note the style of single Quotes)
[15:38:34] <tfitts> is there a simple way to cancel a pending jsonp request when another one gets fired?
[15:39:50] <webguynow> and they use a few Entity references -  and I'm not sure they're legal (maybe the html forced them to be so ) like
[15:39:53] <webguynow> &larr;
[15:40:04] <ajpiano> webguynow: it looks like his CMS borked the shit out of his output
[15:40:22] <webguynow> In concept the code looks pretty cool - and I will try it
[15:40:25] <ajpiano> somehow i doubt this was his intention http://ajpiano.com/cap/08f10f.png
[15:40:49] <webguynow> yes, I agree: Quote style is weird but the code  looks good
[15:49:36] <webguynow> what about the entities ?
[15:50:03] <webguynow> html(‘&radic;’)
[15:55:53] <gataraid> http://jsfiddle.net/RX8BC/2/ whats the proper way to get the name value?
[15:56:16] <gataraid> $(this).attr("name").val(); ?
[16:00:04] <gataraid> nevermind
[16:00:05] <gataraid> got it
[16:00:32] <daleharvey> can you break in a $.each?
[16:00:50] <gataraid> $(':selected',this).attr('name')
[16:00:53] <gataraid> worked
[16:00:53] <gataraid> :)
[16:02:48] <madprops> i have some divs inside a div with display:none,  firstdiv.children().show() wont show them, any idea how to force that?
[16:04:45] <cloke> has anyone encountered an issue where the ready event is trigger twice when jquery mobile is included into a project?
[16:05:06] <KingPhilroy> If I append a bunch of items to a list. Is there a reason why after appending the items they are all unstyled even though the list has a style applied to it via CSS?
[16:06:22] <daleharvey> madprops + KingPhilroy test cases @ http://pastebin.me would help
[16:08:22] <jgspratt> if(\$('#50-dollar-gift-type :selected').val() != 'none'){ \$('#100-dollar').hide();}
[16:08:31] <jgspratt> that won't seem to work for me...
[16:08:33] <KingPhilroy> daleharvey: think I figured it out. The idiot who wrote the html (me) decided to name a div "items-list" instead of the UL that. so when I appended I appended to the div and not the ul. I feel stupid.
[16:08:57] <jgspratt> I want the 100 dollar gift type to go away if someone chooses an entry in the 50 dollar gift types
[16:09:47] <jgspratt> can you do != in jquery?
[16:10:23] <daleharvey> madprops: http://pastebin.me/746c47fed3b257dbced48473b01cc2c6 is it working fine
[16:10:39] <daleharvey> I just found something wierd, you can display:block a script tag
[16:12:38] <madprops> daleharvey, i got it, now im actually showing more divs than I have to
[16:12:54] <cbcwebdev> With jQuery tabs, is it possible to control where ajax content is appended in the DOM? I have a heavy data UI - and the opinionated HTML structure of the tabs doesn't cope well (retrieved content can dynamically change the layout).  I'm assuming I need to overload the 'load' event - any insight would be great
[16:16:29] <jgspratt> how can I exclusively show option lists when no options have been selected?
[16:17:02] <jgspratt> how can I exclusively show option lists when no options have been selected (that is, no options in any of the lists)?
[16:22:14] <jgspratt> anyone got a clue for me?
[16:23:37] <tfitts> your question is a little vague
[16:24:45] <jgspratt> ok.  right.  sorry.  Like this: you have two lists and you want your user to be able to see all of the options on both of them.  When the user selects any item, the other list disappears.
[16:25:51] <tfitts> you could have it display both, give both lists the same class, and put .change on it and hide the sibling
[16:26:10] <tfitts> or you could give them 2 different classes and put a change for each one to hide the other
[16:26:26] <jgspratt> how do I put a .change in?
[16:26:31] <jgspratt> I will actually have five lists.
[16:26:52] <tfitts> ok, so it's probably better to use siblings so you don't have to duplicate tons of code
[16:27:15] <jgspratt> right.
[16:27:41] <tfitts> so $('.selectClass').change(function(event){ $(this).sibling.hide(); });
[16:27:41] <jgspratt> so, these divs are siblings in the DOM... how do I .change them?
[16:28:02] <tfitts> sorry, $(this).siblings.hide();
[16:28:11] <jgspratt> oh, easy!
[16:28:12] <jgspratt> thanks!
[16:28:23] <tfitts> and then you have to give each of the selects the same class
[16:28:31] <tfitts> which in my code would have been "selectClass"
[16:29:41] <jgspratt> what if the user went back to "none"?
[16:29:49] <tfitts> do you want them to pop back up?
[16:30:34] <jgspratt> that would be ideal, yes
[16:31:35] <tfitts> inside the function you would put something like var selected = $(this).val(); if (selected == 'None') $(this).siblings().show(); else $(this).siblings().hide();
[16:31:45] <tfitts> I left the () out of the earlier siblings selector
[16:31:51] <joshontheweb> how do I find the position/offset of an element inside a scrollable area relative to the scrollable area and not the document
[16:32:09] <joshontheweb> basically .offset().top but relative to the top of the scrollable
[16:33:14] <joshontheweb> I need to check to see if an element in the scrollable is visible or beneath the fold and then scroll the area to make it visible
[16:33:45] <jgspratt> tfitts: thanks a bunch!
[16:33:50] <tfitts> did that work?
[16:34:12] <jgspratt> hang on... I was shopping for a wireless bridge for a second
[16:34:38] <jgspratt> I want to get a wired connection for my subnet in my apartment when all we have is wireless.
[16:35:27] <tfitts> yeah, I prefer wired networking whenever possible
[16:36:05] <jgspratt> same.  hey, when you say "inside the function you would put something like" is this the same function as everything else?
[16:36:48] <tfitts> yeah, instead of just having the hide call in the function you would replace it with the code to get the value of what was selected and then choose to hide or show based on that value
[16:38:00] <jgspratt> ok, forgive me if I'm supposed to know this, but is "this" a special var?
[16:38:22] <tfitts> yeah, $(this) is whatever element the function was fired on
[16:38:43] <jgspratt> ahh
[16:38:52] <jgspratt> that will be very useful in the future!
[16:39:03] <tfitts> so if you give all 5 boxes the same class and attach the .change() to that class it then $(this) will just select the box that was clicked, not all of them
[16:39:09] <tfitts> yeah, it's a pretty fundamental concept
[16:42:54] <jgspratt> interesting.  that sibling hide thing hid the whole page.  I didn't check my code well enough I guess.
[16:43:33] <tfitts> oh yeah, I guess it depends on the layout of your page
[16:43:33] <jgspratt> is there a "children()"?
[16:43:40] <tfitts> yeah
[16:43:46] <jgspratt> sweet
[16:43:54] <jgspratt> I think I hid one div too high
[16:44:22] <tfitts> yeah, you should read up on jquery selectors.  That's half the challenge and once you get it it is pretty easy
[16:44:45] <jgspratt> righto
[16:44:54] <tfitts> also you can use firebug to send single lines of jquery to make sure you've got the right selector
[16:45:05] <jgspratt> oh?!  awesoem
[16:45:31] <jgspratt> because children() just slowly eats up page elements
[16:46:07] <philosophically> so i have a site that has a few menus and when an item is clicked it fires several animations and ajax calls... now if a user clicks on another item before the first item finishes it causes some undesirable results... how do i make my site friendlier to use?
[16:46:41] <tfitts> you can save your ajax calls to a variable and do variablename.abort() to cancel them
[16:46:50] <tfitts> or do you need the calls to finish?
[16:47:02] <philosophically> tfitts: need them to finish
[16:47:37] <philosophically> tfitts: is there a way to finish one action before calling another? or cancelling one action reverting back and starting another?
[16:48:16] <tfitts> lookup animation queues
[16:50:18] <Whirl3d> What do I have to do to get jquery to load content through ajax without loading it from the cache?
[16:51:07] <jgspratt> tfitts: can you look at http://pastebin.com/SaFSzNuk ?
[16:51:30] <jgspratt> I can't seem to figure out where to put which code.
[16:53:55] <tfitts> whirl3d: there's a nocache options for ajax
[16:55:36] <xp_prg> hi all, I want to use fancybox but there is some kind of conflict
[16:55:52] <xp_prg> I load it into Drupal and it doesn't work right :(
[16:56:00] <xp_prg> outside of drupal it works fine
[16:56:44] <tfitts> jgspratt: is your site online or just local?
[16:56:57] <jgspratt> mind if I PM you it?
[16:56:59] <xp_prg> is there some extremely simple kind of lightbox jquery library that would not have conflicts?
[16:57:32] <coldhead> xp_prg: roll your own from the modal functions in jquery UI is probably as simple as can be
[16:57:41] <draginx1> Anyone here have experience with History.js?
[16:57:49] <tfitts> jgspratt: that's fine
[17:01:02] <xp_prg> lightbox works but I don't know how to manually populate it and call it with images
[17:01:05] <xp_prg> anyone know that?
[17:25:07] <metropolis> When doing a hover where I want a div to appear, what's the right way to have the div be invisible (but still take up space) prior to mouse-over?
[17:29:08] <ryanseddon> metropolis: visibility: hidden;

[17:37:07] <tiamofirenze> I am using .toggle() to show/hide an interior div, how might I get the fixed height of the containing div to add/subtract 100px when the div is toggled?
[17:47:40] <coldhead> guys can anyone tell me how to do some reasonably complicated thing and then i quit before you explain it to me?
[17:47:42] <coldhead> thanks
[17:48:38] <zpoley> nice

[18:04:07] <Greg___> Does anyone know why the 1.6.2 min version is not available on the website?
[18:04:38] <seancurtis> madprops: if you're using html5 you can use the autofocus attribute
[18:06:01] <madprops> seancurtis, aren't we all using html5?
[18:06:24] <austinbv> with deferred statements in IE the failed function is getting called as well as success

[18:23:18] <KanKouni> jey
[18:23:22] <KanKouni> -j+h
[18:23:24] <KanKouni> :/
[18:23:25] <imsky> wat
[18:23:31] <KanKouni> i mean hey :P
[18:23:38] <imsky> (¬_¬)
[18:23:41] <KanKouni> -_-
[18:24:10] <KanKouni> i have a stupid question , but i'm a bit confuse about where to get some answers , if its on jquery or php..
[18:24:33] <acidjazz> lol
[18:24:49] <KanKouni> :P
[18:24:53] <KanKouni> tricky huh
[18:24:54] <KanKouni> :P~
[18:25:15] <imsky> uhh
[18:25:16] <imsky> wat
[18:25:43] <KanKouni> i've mixed up some codes useing php and jquery .. where the main member area use to .load() to get the target page.
[18:26:08] <imsky> you're probably screwing it up
[18:26:09] <KanKouni> how can i avoid to target the page directly like www.example.com/edit_profile.php
[18:26:14] <KanKouni> really
[18:26:18] <KanKouni> :-|
[18:26:25] <KanKouni> no clue?
[18:26:34] <imsky> don't even know what you're asking
[18:26:58] <KanKouni> ok imsky let me explain
[18:28:56] <KanKouni> lets say i'm on members.php where i have a link when i click it it loads some other page for example $("#edit_profile").click(function() { $("#content").load("edit_profile.php"); });
[18:29:10] <imsky> sure bro
[18:29:54] <KanKouni> what if i dont want it to work if a user try to call that page directly from the address bar for example www.example.com/edit_profile.php , and i want it to work only when the user is on members.php page.
[18:30:11] <KanKouni> for sure i dont want it to be a client side ..
[18:30:16] <imsky> what
[18:30:20] <austinbv> $.then is really not wanting to work with me
[18:31:13] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: Heads up folks: the Hotel Room Block at the jQuery Conference Venue is almost gone! Better get in now... http://t.co/sWF88Ma ★ http://bit.ly/qfBlcq
[18:32:47] <imsky> KanKouni: you can't really do this with just jquery
[18:33:07] <KanKouni> well there is a way but its a client sided
[18:33:15] <imsky> ok what is it
[18:33:16] <KanKouni> where i want it to be server side
[18:33:25] <imsky> yeah well it's best done on server side anyway
[18:33:37] <KanKouni> if the jquery.js is loaded then it will load the page else will exit.
[18:34:28] <imsky> lol
[18:34:49] <imsky> i don't even know why you do it through separate .php files
[18:34:58] <imsky> just do it through page.php?id=editprofile
[18:35:20] <imsky> the user isn't going to guess that URL
[18:35:37] <imsky> or you could pass it with POST!
[18:35:52] <imsky> then that bastard user will be totally in the dark
[18:43:02] <caaakeeey> i need advice on unit testing javscript - i dont know where to start as everything is ajax calls and gui essentially
[18:44:27] <JmZ> say i've rotated some element, is there a way to get the actual current width of the space it takes up
[18:45:13] <JmZ> since the width of the element remains the same, it's just rotated. but visually, the space it takes up is wider due to the rotation
[18:45:23] <JmZ> e.g. | takes less width than /
[18:47:30] <austinbv> can anyone tell me why this works
[18:47:32] <austinbv> http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/QVujr/
[18:48:08] <austinbv> but http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/wzve6/ doesnt

[18:51:48] <DofLeFou> I have a JQuery dialog that gets open once a user click on link … The Dialog is in Modal … Now once the modal is display once the user press "BackSpace key" … the dialog get close automatically .. Is there a way to disable the "BackSpace" key press so that if that user accidentally click on that key …the window dialog is still there
[18:52:02] <imsky> yes
[18:53:08] <DofLeFou> imsky: how would one do that?
[18:53:29] <imsky> first, find out why your dialog closes on hitting bakspace
[18:55:33] <acidjazz> so odd
[18:55:38] <acidjazz> i got a jquery element
[18:55:38] <acidjazz> div
[18:55:42] <acidjazz> button.. i do a .width()

[19:13:18] <amagee> is it possible to use a method like $.ajaxStart or $.ajaxSend to "return false" and cancel an ajax request before it is sent?
[19:14:08] <amagee> if I do $().ajaxStart(function() { return false; }),   ajax requests still get through
[19:18:51] <acidjazz> hey if i have a jquery obj
[19:19:02] <acidjazz> like $('.classA')
[19:19:13] <acidjazz> and i want to reach .classA .classB but $('.classA') was passed in as a variable

[19:19:47] <amagee> acidjazz: $obj.find(".classB") ?

[19:38:15] <austinbv> anyone have some insight on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7278511/jquery-deferred-call-back-oddness
[19:39:39] <coldhead> danheberden knows about that kind of thing

[19:47:30] <Kamakazi> does the webpage have to reload when you create/destroy a session?
[19:53:28] <austinbv> coldhead: you talking to me?
[19:54:25] <coldhead> i was talking to danheberden, hoping he'd show up and solve your problems, austinbv
[19:54:38] <coldhead> but he must be getting a massage or a caesar salad
[19:54:41] <coldhead> sorry
[20:02:09] <danzik17> austinbv: Well, first off in your first implementation you're executing the function, not passing it as an object - is that what you mean by "works"?
[20:06:48] <austinbv> I just accepted an answer
[20:07:34] <madprops> http://i.imgur.com/sIsSC.jpg
[20:14:49] <m0dmd> what's the jquery trick so a div height remains 100% of the viewport, without it added to the height making the page continuously grow
[20:15:28] <djQuery1> m0dmd: that css not jquery
[20:15:48] <m0dmd> I wish you were right.
[20:15:53] <seancurtis> m0dmd: you can position: absolute it with top/right/bottom/left set to 0 or you can also use position: fixed - it is CSS not jQuery
[20:16:19] <djQuery1> body, html { width: 100%; height 100%; padding: 0; margin: 0;}
[20:16:25] <m0dmd> yea that's done already
[20:16:49] <m0dmd> but when content passes the viewport and you scroll down, the container doesn't grow
[20:16:58] <m0dmd> i hate sites designed like this.
[20:17:29] <m0dmd> would be nice to have the html background set to the drop shadow ... but they have a fkn gradient in the bg as well. Horrible.
[20:18:13] <seancurtis> m0dmd: I have no idea what you're talking about - plain english with a demo please?
[20:18:37] <m0dmd> don't worry i just talk to figure out my problems :)
[20:18:46] <seancurtis> ok
[20:18:47] <m0dmd> thanx for the help though :)
[20:23:45] <austinbv> can anyone tell me why the failure callback is not running

[20:26:01] <jQuerier123> hello I need help with understanding $.post
[20:26:12] <coldhead>  can you be more specific?
[20:27:24] <jQuerier123> Ok so I have an input with id of #n so I get the val of the id and create a var for it.
[20:27:43] <coldhead> okay
[20:27:47] <coldhead> sounds good
[20:27:54] <jQuerier123> I'll just post my code.
[20:28:01] <austinbv> sounds better
[20:31:07] <jQuerier123> http://jsfiddle.net/f9rEP/
[20:31:27] <jQuerier123> btw like my username?
[20:31:39] <coldhead> it's very nice
[20:32:07] <jQuerier123> doesn't bring out my knowledge of jquery, lol.
[20:32:14] <jQuerier123> *doesn't it
[20:32:29] <coldhead> i don't understand what you don't get
[20:32:43] <jQuerier123> its not working
[20:32:49] <coldhead> which bit?
[20:32:56] <jQuerier123> I don't get the fname: fname
[20:33:26] <jQuerier123> its not displaying what I echo
[20:34:12] <coldhead> what you pasted there is missing some closing })s
[20:34:14] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/f9rEP/2/
[20:34:20] <coldhead> that's with the code tidied up
[20:34:29] <coldhead> and when i click insert there i see data being sent to the server
[20:34:35] <coldhead> in the chrome inspector
[20:35:14] <jQuerier123> ok thanks.
[20:36:32] <Whirl3d> if you have a vertical series of divs that scroll and you want to make sure that the divs are never cut off in the middle, can someone suggest a way to handle that?
[20:40:44] <Whirl3d> hrmmm
[20:41:06] <coldhead> css3, Whirl3d
[20:41:20] <coldhead> doesn't that have all the nice column stuff?
[20:41:32] <austinbv> gah deferreds are frustrating
[20:43:16] <coldhead> only  at first
[20:44:35] <danzik17> austinbv: I think your failed callback isn't happening because for whatever reason, the 500 response isn't rejecting the deferred.  If I change the url to give a 404, it alerts as expected
[20:49:11] <austinbv> danzik17: so 500's dont trigger a fail?
[20:50:06] <danzik17> austinbv: They should, but they're not in your test case.  Dont know why.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L520
[20:51:08] <austinbv> well that doesnt make sense
[20:51:24] <austinbv> because I need to handle that error topsy throws 500's like its their job
[20:54:52] <austinbv> you know I have always sworn by GUI text editors like TextMate and other crap but after about a week of them all crashing and good old vim doing what it does best I think I am changing my mind
[20:55:09] <jQuerier123> coldhead?
[20:55:09] <Lampoon> coldhead is great
[20:55:24] <jQuerier123> I found out why is wasnt working
[20:55:41] <jQuerier123> I had a submit button instead of a  button
[20:56:40] <jQuerier123> but 1 more question which one is the php var and which one is the jquery var
[20:58:50] <danzik17> austinbv: Seems like a bug to me.  If I manually call .abort() on the deferred, it resolves as expected
[20:58:53] <austinbv> any php vars start with $
[20:59:21] <danzik17> The request is neither rejected nor resolved in your test which doesn't seem right
[20:59:28] <austinbv> I put it up on stackoverflow if noone there knows then I will submit an issue
[20:59:46] <austinbv> I was just noticing that danzik17
[21:00:41] <austinbv> got I love heroku's website
[21:10:34] <jQuerier123> no but when I'm using $.post
[21:12:30] <currentB> I need to select a bunch of checkboxes based on their value using the "jquery multiselect plugin" I'm currently generating a bunch of statements that look like this from the server:
[21:12:30] <currentB>     $("#category_multi").multiselect("widget").find(":checkbox[value='16']").each(function(){
[21:12:30] <currentB> 	this.click();
[21:12:30] <currentB>   });
[21:12:40] <currentB> woops sorry, ment to paste the pastebin link
[21:13:05] <currentB> anyways, is there a better way to do that^
[21:14:01] <currentB> (where it says value=16, it's generating a bunch of these statements with different values there)
[21:27:41] <LearnJQuery> should i learn jQuery or MooTools?
[21:27:52] <Brodingo> jquery
[21:28:11] <LearnJQuery> Brodingo: it seems MooTools is popular.
[21:28:27] <Brodingo> it seems jquery is more popular.
[21:28:36] <LearnJQuery> Brodingo: :D
[21:29:16] <LearnJQuery> if i want to get text in HTML should i be using .val() or .text()?
[21:29:27] <LearnJQuery> both seem to do the same thing.
[21:29:28] <Brodingo> val is for inputs
[21:30:02] <LearnJQuery> ahh....inputs as in <input> or any type of inputs?
[21:30:10] <LearnJQuery> like textarea etc..
[21:31:26] <Brodingo> yes
[21:32:08] <LearnJQuery> but you can still use .text() to get text in textarea.
[21:32:09] <LearnJQuery> whats the difference?
[21:33:40] <coldhead> jQuerier123: what was the problem?
[21:33:54] <coldhead> oh i see now, thanks
[21:34:26] <jQuerier123> yep, question the first thing in the { } of the $.post is the js var right?
[21:35:11] <LearnJQuery> coldhead: whats the difference between new function(e){} and just function(e){}?
[21:36:13] <coldhead> i don't know, man
[21:36:28] <coldhead> probably something really obscure that only weirdo JS freaks know
[21:36:37] <coldhead> i've never had to use new function
[21:36:49] <Brodingo> ever
[21:37:11] <coldhead> jQuerier123: it's my first day using jQuery
[21:37:50] <jQuerier123> oh ok, thanks anyway.
[21:38:32] <LearnJQuery> coldhead: no worries. i can't expect you to know everything since its your first day!
[21:38:49] <jQuerier123> same here
[21:38:53] <coldhead> same here!
[21:38:56] <coldhead> thanks fellas
[21:39:22] <danzik17> LearnJQuery: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2274695/new-function-with-lower-case-f-in-javascript - looks like a different method of accomplishing a self-invoking function possibly.
[21:39:38] <LearnJQuery> coldhead: i'm guessing "new" makes it into an object.
[21:39:58] <coldhead> ?mdc new
[21:40:18] <coldhead> oh god there's no bot
[21:40:27] <coldhead> CHANNEL'S CLOSED, EVERYONE GO HOME
[21:40:29] <coldhead> DON'T PANIC
[21:40:41] <danzik17> LearnJQuery: 'new' invokes the given function as a constructor
[21:41:39] <LearnJQuery> danzik17: so another way of creating objects.
[21:42:15] <coldhead> i thought javascript used prototypes
[21:44:15] <LearnJQuery> it does
[21:45:36] <coldhead> and prototypal objects
[21:45:52] <coldhead> are you guys sure javascript is gonna help me get a girlfriend?
[21:48:02] <LearnJQuery> coldhead: yes. girls like boys that know js and have a "cold head".
[21:50:44] <LearnJQuery> anyone know anything about casting functions into Query?
[21:52:44] <tash> what the heck am I doing wrong? http://pastie.org/2469363 .... the .html isn't working in my if()
[21:52:57] <tash> would someone mind looking at that pastie?
[21:53:30] <LearnJQuery> tash: convert it into jsfiddle see jsfiddle.net
[21:57:28] <madprops> how can I use getscript to replace a specific js file?
[21:58:50] <djQuery1> madprops: even if you replace the file isnt the javascript in the file allready chached/
[21:59:35] <djQuery1> or rather in memory
[21:59:45] <madprops> true
[22:01:13] <Cork> madprops: just loading a file that sets the same function names will replace its info
[22:01:21] <Cork> madprops: js doesn't have the consept of files
[22:01:32] <Cork> its just load paths that load the content into the same scope
[22:01:44] <Cork> (the scope beeing window)
[22:02:24] <Cork> if the code is warapped in scope though, you can't replace it unless theres handles to remove the old code
[22:04:56] <sanduz2> can someone tell me why this isnt fading in? everything else, including fading out, seems to work fine. and a similar function in the same script fades in just fine. any ideas? http://pastebin.com/18ubSPiB
[22:06:17] <Cork> sanduz2: heh, just a side question, why are you mixing jquery and native calls?
[22:06:49] <Cork> sanduz2: and the html is needed to be able to tell whats not working
[22:07:24] <Cork> sanduz2: btw is the callback for the fadeout adding the elements you try to fadein afterwards?
[22:08:18] <LearnJQuery> how to disable javascript?
[22:08:45] <Cork> LearnJQuery: depends on what browser your using
[22:08:51] <coldhead> close the browser
[22:08:57] <coldhead> Javascript: DISABLED
[22:09:04] <LearnJQuery> Corky: IE
[22:09:15] <coldhead> lol corky
[22:10:02] <LearnJQuery> Sorry, I mean't Cork.
[22:10:04] <coldhead> like on Life Goes On
[22:10:26] <sanduz2> Cork, yes
[22:10:44] <LearnJQuery> so thats Javascript: DISABLED?
[22:11:07] <LearnJQuery> and i put that in jQuery script and it should work?
[22:11:16] <LearnJQuery> works on all browsers?
[22:11:27] <coldhead> no, that doesn't work in IE
[22:12:00] <Cork> LearnJQuery: the gear > internet options > custom level...
[22:12:10] <Cork> (ie RELLY sucks when it comes to this)
[22:12:55] <coldhead> also when it comes to everything else
[22:13:41] <Cork> LearnJQuery: then go search for Scripting > Active scripting > Disable
[22:13:53] <Cork> coldhead: ya but this is even worse...
[22:14:01] <Cork> they could just as well not have the option >_<
[22:14:16] <LearnJQuery> Cork: found it thanks. now what do i do for other browsers?
[22:14:38] <Cork> LearnJQuery: in firefox its options > content > uncheck javascript
[22:14:49] <Cork> opera has something similar
[22:15:00] <Cork> chrome needs a parameter when you starts it
[22:15:08] <Cork> donno about safari
[22:16:05] <taservictim> just getting used to this iPad
[22:16:20] <LearnJQuery> Cork: no worries. so this is done at the browser level. I thought there might be some code i can put in somewhere.
[22:17:43] <Cork> LearnJQuery: firefox, and chrome can disalbe scripts on a page
[22:18:40] <LearnJQuery> Cork: alrighty matey.
[22:18:59] <Cork> LearnJQuery: one min and i'll give you a link
[22:21:13] <Cork> LearnJQuery: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP/CSP_policy_directives
[22:21:42] <Cork> set it to none, and you disable scripts in browsers that supports csp
[22:23:42] <LearnJQuery> Cork: <html>csp: none;</html> thanks
[22:24:14] <Cork> LearnJQuery: no you can't set it in the html
[22:24:19] <Cork> you need to set it in the header
[22:24:30] <Cork> that is, the http header
[22:25:15] <LearnJQuery> Cork: no worries. i'll try <header>csp:none;</header>
[22:25:23] <Cork> won't work
[22:26:04] <Cork> LearnJQuery: it has to be in the http header
[22:26:12] <Cork> you can't put it in the html document
[22:27:13] <LearnJQuery> Cork: ok i'll google http header and figure out how to set it to none.
