[00:01:32] <Cork> fattest: something like http://jsfiddle.net/rWMKK/29/
[00:02:02] <fattest> Cork: thank you very very much!
[00:02:24] <Tomashe> first of all this is input feild
[00:02:40] <Tomashe> so text is wrong there , i guess its hould be val() . but i dont understand the match.text
[00:03:51] <Tomashe> match.text gives me undefined
[00:04:17] <Cork> ugg did i write text ....
[00:04:21] <Cork> it's match.test()
[00:04:41] <Cork> match.test($(this).text())
[00:04:55] <fattest> Cork: if you click on the pause button the first time, it doesn't work. You have to click it twice in order to get it working...do you know why?
[00:05:54] <Cork> fattest: yes, but honestly try figuring it out your self
[00:06:00] <Cork> it should be fairly obvious
[00:06:11] <fattest> Cork: its because its clicking on play ,
[00:06:16] <Cork> no
[00:06:30] <Cork> (hint: label)
[00:06:35] <Snoopal> hey guys does somebody of you know a plugin where user are able to select a part of a picture like on facebook where you can choose of your profile picture a specific area?
[00:07:52] <fattest> Cork: fixed it! http://jsfiddle.net/rWMKK/32/
[00:08:58] <Cork> fattest: uh, not really the correct fix
[00:09:10] <Cork> fattest: when you create the original button you don't set a label
[00:09:37] <Cork> so text matching doesn't work
[00:09:43] <fattest> Cork: do you mean line 14?
[00:09:49] <fattest> oh
[00:09:55] <Cork> no
[00:14:06] <Cork> heh http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/200000/10000/0000/100/210165/210165.strip.gif
[00:17:03] <Tomashe> Crok, looks like object.prev(".page").find(".services-t").length always = 0, the .services-t is loading by ajax
[00:17:15] <Tomashe> maybe it can not catch live events?
[00:17:25] <Cork> that's not events
[00:17:33] <Cork> and i can't tell i don't know your html structure
[00:17:51] <Cork> or rather dom structure
[00:18:29] <Tomashe> there is a <div class="page .. inside it few other divs and then inside alot of class="services-t" divs
[00:18:49] <Cork> Tomashe: please update the jsfiddle with some structure
[00:20:36] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/U7Vfz/2/
[00:20:38] <Tomashe> updated
[00:20:59] <Tomashe> wait le tme reupdate
[00:21:31] <Tomashe> lok at that
[00:21:31] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/U7Vfz/3/
[00:28:14] <Tomashe> Cork?
[00:28:54] <Cork> Tomashe: the server got a hickup

[00:32:03] <sabotender> I am trying to update an element's 'class' attribute, how can I do this?
[00:32:04] <Anticom> Morning
[00:32:23] <Anticom> haha Cork nice image :D
[00:33:09] <Tomashe> sabotender : $(".selector").attr("attribute-name","value")
[00:33:10] <Cork> ?api prev
[00:33:10] <b-ot> Cork: .prev(): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[00:33:19] <Cork> Tomashe: prev looks for siblings not parents
[00:33:23] <Cork> you want closest
[00:33:28] <Cork> ?api closest
[00:33:28] <b-ot> Cork: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:33:30] <Tomashe> damn
[00:33:40] <guideX> does jquery have something that will check to see if an array index exists? like if($(arr).hasId(4)) {
[00:33:45] <Tomashe> closest isnt good enough
[00:33:55] <guideX> something equivellant to ubound
[00:34:07] <Cork> Tomashe: why not?
[00:34:11] <Tomashe> there are few class="page" . i dont want mistakly choose next one
[00:34:20] <Tomashe> i need the one before the search
[00:34:31] <Cork> Tomashe: it isn't before
[00:34:39] <Cork> it is the closest .page parent
[00:34:46] <Cork> you think html
[00:34:47] <Cork> not dom
[00:35:21] <Tomashe> ohh ok
[00:35:32] <sabotender> Tomashe: i saw that, so i can specify "class"?
[00:36:14] <Tomashe> tyhatnks CORK
[00:37:25] <Cork> Tomashe: also keypress is a deprecated event
[00:37:28] <Cork> use keyup
[00:37:41] <sabotender> heh I will assume your silence for a yes
[00:38:27] <Cork> Tomashe: http://jsfiddle.net/U7Vfz/6/
[00:39:33] <Cork> sabotender: best is to use the addClass and removeClass commands
[00:39:47] <sabotender> ooo
[00:39:49] <sabotender> sexy
[00:39:50] <Cork> sabotender: else you would have to rebuild the class attribute to not break thids party things
[00:40:07] <sabotender> see i knew there was a better way
[00:40:33] <Cork> there is also the classList property that lets you do the same thing :)
[00:40:38] <Cork> but it's fairly new
[00:40:45] <Cork> ?mdn classList
[00:40:45] <b-ot> Cork: element.classList - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.classList
[00:40:55] <Cork> (it's also native js)
[00:42:14] <fattest> how do i make my show hide hidden on default http://jsfiddle.net/5REJa/3/
[00:42:33] <intermission1> Can anyone help me figure out how to toggle a jquery mobile navbar icon? http://jsfiddle.net/G34jD/9/
[00:43:04] <fattest> intermission1: what are you trying to do?
[00:43:30] <Tomashe> ok
[00:43:37] <Cork> fattest: as you use slideToggle i would recommend using .hide() on page load
[00:44:12] <intermission1> fattest: I want the icon in the navbar to change
[00:50:13] <Cork> intermission1: i would not recommend using setInterval for that
[00:50:26] <Cork> especially if you plan to use it for mobile
[00:50:45] <Cork> use css animation instead
[00:51:05] <Cork> yes that means you would have to copy some of there css
[00:51:23] <Cork> but it will tax the device a lot less then a constant setInterval timer running
[00:51:52] <Cork> or at the very least use requestAnimationFrame
[00:54:10] <intermission1> Cork: that's fine it was just an experiment. What I really want is to replace the icon with a number which is the number of new messages the user has.
[00:55:04] <intermission1> Cork: So I'll make my custom icon set but I can't figure out how to change the icon
[00:55:36] <Cork> intermission1: the icon is controlled by the class on the icon element in it
[00:55:45] <Cork> just have a class override that
[00:56:09] <intermission1> like, there's no navbar('refresh')
[00:56:38] <Cork> why refresh?
[00:56:41] <Cork> just set the class
[00:56:56] <Cork> it's just css anyway
[01:01:14] <nicolas_FR> hi there
[01:02:40] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/64cG4/3/ <---- what is the best way to get the "var result" in "JavaScript generated in time seconds" < time ?
[01:03:31] <Cork> Whiskey: concating to string
[01:04:05] <Whiskey> that means?
[01:04:10] <ms99999> I've got an existing dropdown menu I've used and the one link in it isn't clicking on iphone. I think because I need a hover delay.  can anyone suggest a quick add on to it I can put into delay the hover - http://smick.net/urls/9b
[01:04:19] <ms99999> the dropdown is at the very bottom.
[01:04:22] <Whiskey> i mean i canÂ´t get it in html, if i donÂ´t change the html code after its generated, its the only way i can do it as i know
[01:04:38] <Cork> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/64cG4/4/
[01:04:48] <intermission1> Cork: I'm glad I know that now about the css transition approach.. but my actual question is how to dynamically change the icon
[01:05:08] <Cork> intermission1: and i've already answered that one twice
[01:05:27] <Whiskey> cork, i mean in the HTML not in the JS :)
[01:05:39] <Cork> in the title you mean?
[01:05:44] <Whiskey> yeh
[01:05:44] <compact> i have a form, that depends on certain options selected, relevant fields will show. i have a .hide & .show on select, which shows the div, however the <input> may get interrupted with fields down further on the page
[01:05:46] <compact> any idea?
[01:08:09] <Cork> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/64cG4/5/ ?
[01:09:12] <Whiskey> yeh it come in wrong titel but yeh something like that :)
[01:09:33] <Whiskey> you can use jQuery if that more easy as i use it
[01:10:07] <Whiskey> it come in tooltip class not Copyright class thats strange
[01:10:37] <Cork> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/64cG4/6/?
[01:11:06] <Whiskey> Cork yeh, how do i get it to not remove whats in there allredy?
[01:11:20] <Whiskey> like append it or something
[01:11:24] <Cork> Whiskey: you would have to concat what is already in there
[01:11:37] <Cork> you could do something like .title += ""
[01:11:56] <Whiskey> lets try it
[01:12:22] <Whiskey> yeh awseome :)
[01:12:49] <Whiskey> thx alot cork
[01:12:53] <Cork> np
[01:15:28] <nicolas_FR> got a problem with jquery validation plugin : I've put a focusOut listener in my settings which valid the element. So each time I focusOut from an input, field should be validated. jQ(element).valid() is always called, but my success / error function are not on some fields.. and I don't know why =(. http://pastebin.com/zyQsNEhG
[01:16:36] <Whiskey> sadly for me its not working in my code :D baa
[01:17:16] <nicolas_FR> in the pasteBin above, I'm wondering why success log are not called when the focusOut is actually called
[01:17:52] <Whiskey> its says query is null its impossible
[01:19:10] <Cork> Whiskey: make sure you don't run the code before the dom is parsed
[01:19:18] <Cork> Whiskey: if you do you need to wait for ready
[01:19:26] <Whiskey> yeh thats true
[01:19:27] <Whiskey> thx
[01:19:28] <Cork> (before adding it to the page)
[01:19:36] <Whiskey> yeh
[01:19:36] <Whiskey> i know
[01:21:07] <Whiskey> awsome :)
[01:26:09] <compact> any idea with my problem?
[01:39:39] <Whiskey> Cork: You around?
[01:39:48] <Cork> ya
[01:39:53] <Whiskey> As you are a bit of an expert here
[01:40:06] <Whiskey> i have my own scripts that i load and then i have jQuery that i also load in
[01:40:32] <Whiskey> i found out that i can run this in async but thats not working, my guss would be that jQuery is slower then my scripts to load
[01:40:59] <Whiskey> " jQuery loads slower then my scripts"
[01:41:15] <Cork> you never want to async load libs other libs depend on
[01:41:36] <Whiskey> ok
[01:41:44] <Whiskey> so my guss was right then
[01:42:04] <Cork> how are you loading them btw
[01:42:33] <Whiskey> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.js" async></script>
[01:42:40] <Whiskey> and under it i load in my scripts same
[01:42:42] <Cork> ah, ya
[01:42:56] <Cork> async is only good if nothing depends on it
[01:43:04] <Cork> else you can get really horrible problems
[01:43:10] <Whiskey> builded a PHP checker that automatic detecs if its IE then use 1 version else use newest 2 version :) its always fetch latest :D
[01:43:12] <Cork> it's not just load time
[01:43:18] <Cork> it might be latency and what not
[01:43:24] <Whiskey> yeh
[01:43:59] <Whiskey> just stick whit it on my stuff then as its not depends on anything more the jQuery thats allredy loaded :)
[01:51:50] <ahandy> quick q, i want a full page background slideshow that allows vertical scrolling transitions for the images
[01:51:53] <ahandy> any you recommend?
[01:52:44] <Cork> WTF.. this person is just too messed up...
[01:52:47] <Cork> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuqemytQ5QA
[01:52:58] <mento> hi guys, i'm stuck on a thing with hiding a video element on ended.  It works in all major browsers, except for safari - i have no clue why or how... http://jsfiddle.net/EqN4T/
[01:58:53] <seutje> mento: doesn't work in my chromesie either, try using addEventListener instead: http://jsfiddle.net/EqN4T/2/
[01:58:53] <Whiskey> Cork, is not that him in yeh when you can sell your idees to
[01:58:56] <Whiskey> i donÂ´t know the name of the show
[01:59:37] <seutje> Cork: I have a brother who's about the same level of naive
[01:59:47] * Cork shivers...
[01:59:58] <Whiskey> Yeh Shark Tank :)
[02:00:17] <Cork> i've heard the same kind of remarks about unemployment
[02:00:29] <Cork> "they are just lazy"
[02:00:34] <Cork> right...
[02:00:54] <mento> seutje: ah, thats strange what version of chrome are you running on? I'm on 32.0.1700.76 m
[02:01:25] <seutje> 31.0.1650.63 but it's telling me there's an update waiting
[02:01:42] <seutje> would explain why it doesn't work in safari either, they're a bit slow to update sometimes
[02:02:05] <mento> seutje: anyway, it should work on older versions too. Your EventListener did the trick though!
[02:02:06] <mento> thanks
[02:02:37] <seutje> general rule of thumb, never onAnything, it doesn't allow for multiple listeners
[02:03:19] <mento> ah i see - good to know!
[02:17:20] <angelxmoreno> where can i see what does not work in jquery ui 1.10.4 when using jquery 2.0 ?
[02:18:11] <Cork> angelxmoreno: ie
[02:18:36] <Cork> angelixd: jquery 1.10 and 2.x is compatible
[02:18:43] <Cork> except 2.x doesn't support older ie
[02:18:55] <Cork> opps
[02:18:59] <Cork> *angelxmoreno:
[02:19:52] <angelxmoreno> so when the site says jqueryui is compatible with JQuery 1.6+ it includes 2.0? not like "all versions of 1x after 1.6" ?
[02:19:59] <Cork> no
[02:20:12] <Cork> if it is compatible with 1.10 it is compatible with 2.x
[02:20:24] <Cork> if it isn't compatible with 1.9+ you can't use 2.0
[02:21:07] <Cork> bascially 1.9 removed a lot of old deprecated commands
[02:21:12] <angelxmoreno> intereseting, did not know that. some libs would say "compatible with 1.6+ and 2.0+"  awesome,  thanks Cork
[02:21:24] <Cork> angelxmoreno: no
[02:21:33] <Cork> they most likely won't ever say 2.0+
[02:21:41] <Cork> but they would say 1.9+
[02:21:50] <angelxmoreno> Cork, no, i men outside of jquery
[02:21:51] <Cork> cause the change happens in 1.9 not 2.0
[02:22:13] <Cork> angelxmoreno: and if it is compatible with 2.0 it is compatible with 1.9
[02:22:34] <angelxmoreno> got it, Cork you the man
[02:23:26] <Cork> angelxmoreno: but ya ui tends to be quite bad at saying what version it is compatible with
[02:23:37] <Cork> they say what version the latest version works with
[02:23:50] <Cork> but not what version of jquery ui you need to a spacific version of jquery
[02:24:36] <seutje> so nice when clients take initiative and suggest using certain jQuery plugins
[02:25:11] <angelxmoreno> which is why i got confused to begin with. aren't there like major improvements between jquery 1.6 and 2.0? maybe some performance increases? it would seem that ui is not taking advantage of them, if there are any that it could
[02:25:46] <Cork> angelxmoreno: what ui means on the page is "this plugin works with jquery 1.6 and up"
[02:25:54] <Cork> they don't say what is the max version of older versions
[02:26:03] <angelxmoreno> right
[02:26:20] <Cork> but ya they use code in a way that is compatible with 1.6
[02:26:30] <Cork> that is fairly easy though
[02:26:56] <Cork> replaced .on(delegate) with .delegate and .on(normal) with .bind and you are mostly there
[02:28:48] <angelxmoreno> Cork, interesting
[02:34:05] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/8yLqG/
[02:34:17] <compact> any idea why it wont remove? ive put an alert in there, and still no luck
[02:35:32] <Cork> compact: syntax error
[02:35:34] <Cork> line 4
[02:36:11] <compact> ive removed the )
[02:36:13] <compact> still no luck
[02:36:20] <Cork> not remove
[02:36:21] <Cork> move it
[02:36:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/8yLqG/1/
[02:36:41] <compact> ah git ut
[02:36:43] <compact> got it
[02:36:44] <compact> thanks
[02:42:10] <compact> after its removed, and they select the other option, how can i get it to show?
[02:42:13] <compact> ive tried .show
[02:42:22] <Cork> you can't
[02:42:25] <Cork> you removed them
[02:42:33] <Cork> if you want to show and hide them use...
[02:42:35] <Cork> show and hide
[02:43:07] <compact> i tried the hide, but because it hides, all the inputs still show, and will change the value down onthe form
[02:43:09] <compact> on the*
[02:43:22] <compact> which is why i used remove, so no conflicts
[02:43:40] <Cork> well you need to recreate them if you really feel you have to remove them
[02:43:59] <compact> no other way? even if something else exists apart from remove
[02:44:28] <Cork> well just leave the field
[02:44:38] <Cork> and let the server ignore is if the dropdown is 2
[02:44:51] <compact> if magento only played nicely
[02:45:10] <Cork> eh..
[02:45:16] <Cork> well you could have two forms
[02:45:26] <Cork> and hide and show the different form based on the dropdown i guess
[02:45:45] <compact> i want to record details before the dropdown
[02:45:45] <compact> lol
[02:46:03] <Cork> ugg...
[02:46:06] <compact> i know
[02:46:13] <Cork> the world have too much buggy server code...
[02:46:30] <compact> so pretty much remove, and the customer has to refresh the page
[02:46:31] <Cork> compact: well you could move the fields out of them from to a holding variable instead
[02:46:37] <compact> hrm
[02:46:39] <Cork> and then have it inserted in the form
[02:46:52] <Cork> though remember this will break if the page is loaded without js
[02:46:58] <Cork> and your server might break from it
[02:47:05] <Cork> (meaning fix the server)
[02:47:40] <Cork> js won't ever be a solution for this kind of things, cause the server has to always handle what is sent to it
[02:47:42] <compact> bloooody magento
[02:47:45] <Cork> js won't ever provide security
[02:47:51] <compact> yeah :\
[02:48:12] <Cork> js can provide nice covers that hides the security holes
[02:48:19] <Cork> but i don't see that as even worth the time
[02:51:47] <gry> hi https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gryllida/common.js @ dom.query.then (last 20 lines), why is 'data' undefined? thanks
[02:53:48] <shoky> gry: because the deferred is resolved with no arguments
[02:54:27] <shoky> change dfd.resolve()  to dfd.resolve(data)
[02:56:13] <gry> shoky thanks i did, it's now doing nothing and no error
[02:56:56] <shoky> time to debug
[02:57:26] <gry> oh i see, i should resolve(understandJson(data))
[02:57:58] <gry> freak, it thinks thats false... thanks for the advice nevertheless, its another problem, you solved the first one :)
[02:58:22] <shoky> "return false"  :P
[03:00:54] <shoky> gry: in case you didn't spot it yet.. i think your .reject and .resolve  should be swapped in your if/else
[03:01:09] <gry> you see in Page.prototype.query if understandJson is false then the query is rejected, so if in last function on the page it's entering .then() it means the query resolved and understandJson wasn't false
[03:01:29] <gry> refresh please, i edited it just now
[03:01:53] <shoky> eh use a var
[03:02:05] <shoky> var result = understandJson(data);
[03:02:38] <shoky> (not that thats the issue)
[03:03:07] <gry> good find
[03:03:55] <shoky> so it's still false now?
[03:04:36] <gry> it is
[03:04:49] <gry> alert(data); in the last function on the page, it says false
[03:05:17] <shoky> dont alert please. console.log
[03:05:38] <gry> on it
[03:05:46] <shoky> donno why it's false.. need to see it live
[03:06:26] <gry> log in, put into your common.js, test
[03:07:21] <shoky> i don't have a wiki user ;S
[03:07:56] <shoky> and no idea what's common.js
[03:08:07] <shoky> or what all y'all are doing with all these wiki scripts

[04:12:31] <seutje> seems to work as expected
[04:13:13] <seutje> don't mind the + button, based it off an old example that used slightly less dynamic tabs
[04:13:44] <stelonix> hmm
[04:14:05] <stelonix> I tried that at work, but when I click on the tab it'll simply open as a normal link, not via ajax
[04:14:16] <stelonix> I'll try it again when I get there in a while
[04:16:20] <stelonix> the tab I add also doesn't have the correct smoothness styles
[04:16:41] <stelonix> if I do a .tabs("refresh") the css will get fixed though
[04:16:49] <stelonix> not if I do it on the code side of things
[04:17:08] <stelonix> I mean, if I do it in the web console
[04:22:15] <namnone> hey guys
[04:22:19] <namnone> can someone help me out with some jquery stuff
[04:24:46] <Cork> namnone: not if you don't ask a question
[04:25:22] <namnone> i have six div's which have two states, they each toggle with 	$(this).toggleClass(', 50);
[04:25:40] <namnone> they all have their own jquery classes, im trying to get it so that if i click the green div and it expands
[04:25:50] <namnone> once i click the blue one, i want the green one to go back to its original state
[04:28:49] <namnone> if that makes any sense
[04:31:55] <dd3> Hi! I'm trying to make a menu for my jquery mobile site, using panels. It works fine when im on the frontpage of the site, but everywhere else the panels wont open. Does anyone know how to make this work?
[04:35:40] <seutje> namnone: $('body').on('click', '.identifier', function() { $('.identifier').not(this).removeClass('expand'); $(this).addClass('expand'); }); ?
[04:36:06] <seutje> where "identifier" is the class that identifies your blocks and "expand" is the class to trigger the expanding
[04:39:16] <namnone> seutje: thanks. the thing is each colour class has a css height. would i be better off restructuring it so there's only one class that handles expanding?
[04:39:41] <seutje> namnone: u could use the combination of both
[04:39:42] <namnone> instead of the height being set in each colour class
[04:39:48] <namnone> hmm
[04:40:08] <seutje> .foo { background: blue;} .foo.expand { height: 45678px; }
[04:40:38] <seutje> unless u need to calculate height on a per element basis
[04:40:42] <seutje> then u'll need an each
[04:42:29] <namnone> let me set up a jsfiddle, it might help understand easier
[04:51:37] <namnone> seutje: doesn't exactly work, but should help with structure http://jsfiddle.net/P9Ku3/1/
[04:53:14] <seutje> namnone: .active-green is kinda silly, no?
[04:53:19] <seutje> #green.active
[04:53:41] <seutje> same with border-green and stuff
[04:54:03] <namnone> yeah
[04:54:15] <namnone> i should really change that, just trying to get it done quick. thanks for reminding me
[04:54:16] <namnone> ill fix it
[04:54:35] <xqo> http://bpaste.net/show/tNCNa26tAFiBiuzh7svT/
[04:54:54] <xqo> is there a more elegant way to build a string with arguments that may or may not be undefined? http://bpaste.net/show/tNCNa26tAFiBiuzh7svT/
[04:55:30] <seutje> namnone: http://jsfiddle.net/P9Ku3/2/
[04:57:35] <seutje> js> var foo, bar = 'meh', baz, poo = 'pee', result = ''; result  += foo ? foo : ''; result += bar ? bar : ''; result += baz ? baz : ''; result += poo ? poo : ''; print(result);
[04:57:39] <b-ot> seutje: mehpee
[04:58:06] <seutje> xqo: u can just += umodes ? umodes : '';
[04:58:25] <seutje> if umodes is truthy, it'll add it, otherwise it'll just add an empty string
[04:59:19] <seutje> or wait, I;m being silly
[05:00:27] <Cork> seutje: why not just push them all to an array and join them?
[05:00:38] <seutje> yeah
[05:00:48] <seutje> or just || them
[05:01:16] <Cork> js>  var foo, bar = 'meh', baz, poo = 'pee'; print([].push(foo).push(bar).push(baz).push(poo).join(''))
[05:01:19] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:01:48] <Cork> ah right
[05:02:02] <Cork> js>  var foo, bar = 'meh', baz, poo = 'pee', result=[]; print(result.push(foo).push(bar).push(baz).push(poo).join(''))
[05:02:04] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:02:19] <Cork> can chain :/
[05:02:23] <namnone> seutje: thanks, http://jsfiddle.net/P9Ku3/3/ i can still open both green and blue boxes though :(
[05:02:23] <Cork> *can't
[05:02:25] <namnone> at the same time
[05:03:06] <Cork> 50?!?
[05:03:44] <Cork> namnone: toggleClass takes a boolean not a number
[05:03:58] <seutje> js> var foo = function(meh, poo, pee) { meh = meh || ''; poo = poo || ''; pee = pee || ''; return meh + poo + pee; }; print(foo('lol', 'poo'));
[05:04:00] <b-ot> seutje: lolpoo
[05:04:19] <Cork> uh
[05:05:14] <seutje> namnone: lol forgot the actual intention http://jsfiddle.net/P9Ku3/4/
[05:05:33] <seutje> kinda sucks u can't just use default values for function arguments
[05:05:38] <seutje> xcept in ESNext
[05:05:57] <Cork> js> var foo = function() { return Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, ''); }; foo('lol', 'poo');
[05:05:59] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:06:02] <Cork> opps
[05:06:06] <Cork> js> var foo = function() { return Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, ''); }; print(foo('lol', 'poo');)
[05:06:08] <b-ot> Cork: No output.

[05:06:23] <Cork> it really isn't my bot day today >_<
[05:06:29] * seutje puts on the OMGSTRICTMODE face
[05:06:32] <seutje> :P
[05:06:44] <Cork> arguments is fine in strict mode
[05:06:51] <Cork> callee is another matter
[05:06:52] <seutje> oh, it is?
[05:06:55] <Cork> ya
[05:06:59] <seutje> neat
[05:07:06] <seutje> tend to avoid it anyway though
[05:07:06] <Cork> js> "strict mode";var foo = function() { return Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, ''); }; print(foo('lol', 'poo'));
[05:07:08] <b-ot> Cork: lolpoo
[05:07:08] <seutje> such dynamic
[05:07:42] <Cork> i use it a lot
[05:07:56] <Cork> it is very useful until harmony gets the ... syntax
[05:08:30] <seutje> js> "strict mode";var foo = function() { return Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, ''); }; print(foo('lol', false, 'poo'));

[05:08:41] <aQuestion> Hello, can someone please tell me why http://jsfiddle.net/yLNb9/ is not working?
[05:08:53] <aQuestion> It works when I try it on my local browser, but not in jsfiddle
[05:08:56] <seutje> aQuestion: no jQuery!
[05:09:08] <aQuestion> oh
[05:09:10] <aQuestion> okay
[05:09:24] <seutje> holy poop that's annoying
[05:09:25] <aQuestion> well the question I had was, in my local browser I get an infinite loop of alerts
[05:09:32] <fabioportieri> now you have to change your nick to twoQuestion!
[05:09:36] <seutje> when the alert gets cancelled, the field regains focus, triggering the alert
[05:09:40] <aQuestion> I'm just wondering why that is? Shouldn't focus() only be called once?
[05:09:46] <seutje> aQuestion: ^
[05:09:50] <aQuestion> ah
[05:10:05] <aQuestion> so it's a byproduct of using alert()
[05:10:06] <seutje> alert is blocking and hijacking user interaction
[05:10:09] <seutje> yes
[05:10:18] <aQuestion> if I was to do any other action there, it would only be done once right?
[05:10:28] <seutje> you could force the focus some place else
[05:10:40] <aQuestion> I was just doing something for testing purposes
[05:10:43] <seutje> aQuestion: depends, if it's as blocking as alert, it'll act the same (thing window.confirm and the likes)
[05:10:44] <aQuestion> I don't need an alert there
[05:10:56] <seutje> try to make it a habit to use console.log instead
[05:10:57] <aQuestion> Ah okay
[05:11:13] <seutje> it's far more powerfull, as it will allow you to inspect whatever you logged in the javascript console
[05:11:18] <aQuestion> But just something simple like, I don't know, changing some text in a div or something would be perfectly fine I take it
[05:11:25] <seutje> like u can expand objects and jump to the reference in the elements tab and stuff
[05:11:34] <aQuestion> Ah okay
[05:11:37] <seutje> aQuestion: yeah, sure, that's non-blocking
[05:11:46] <aQuestion> And that will work inside Safari without having to install any third party add ons?
[05:11:52] <seutje> well, not entirely, but it doesn't hijack interaction
[05:11:55] <aQuestion> The console.log I mean
[05:12:04] <seutje> yessir
[05:12:09] <aQuestion> Fantastic
[05:12:14] <aQuestion> Thanks for your help everyone
[05:12:20] <seutje> in IE8 you will need to have the console open or it'll error out though
[05:12:21] <aQuestion> Have a great day
[05:12:30] <seutje> but you shouldn't leave console.log statements in production code anyway
[05:12:38] <aQuestion> Ah okay, I'll keep that one in mind!

[05:12:43] <aQuestion> Cheers
[05:12:45] <namnone> seutje: Thanks so much! makes sense to me now
[05:12:53] <Cork> seutje: its "use strict"; not "strict mode" :)
[05:12:53] <seutje> check that preso for more details on debugging jquery
[05:13:14] <seutje> Cork: lol, I copy/pasted urs
[05:13:17] <seutje> SO YEAH
[05:13:19] <Cork> anyway ya, string conversion breaks that one, though it would break your to
[05:13:25] <seutje> only true
[05:13:27] <seutje> not false :P
[05:13:29] <seutje> but yeah
[05:13:30] <seutje> wonky
[05:13:35] <Cork> ya i got it when i wrote this
[05:13:37] <Cork> js> "strict mode"; var foo = function me() { return arguments.callee.name; }; print(foo('lol', 'poo'));
[05:13:43] <b-ot> Cork: me
[05:13:45] <Cork> bah..
[05:13:46] <seutje> still works :D
[05:13:49] <Cork> js> "use strict"; var foo = function me() { return arguments.callee.name; }; print(foo('lol', 'poo'));
[05:13:51] <b-ot> Cork: me
[05:13:53] <seutje> boom
[05:13:55] <seutje> wat?
[05:13:59] <Cork> broken bot...
[05:14:08] <seutje> too lax
[05:14:10] <seutje> oh wait
[05:14:13] <Cork> we really need to get a better bot here...
[05:14:21] <seutje> use strict only applies to the function it's in, no?
[05:14:25] <Cork> no
[05:14:33] <Cork> try run that code in a browser console
[05:14:43] <seutje> js> (function(){"use strict"; var foo = function me() { return arguments.callee.name; }; print(foo('lol', 'poo'));})();
[05:14:46] <b-ot> seutje: me
[05:14:53] <Cork> the bot don't know what "use strict" is
[05:15:25] <seutje> erm
[05:15:51] <seutje> http://i.imgur.com/BFLPv1F.png
[05:16:31] <seutje> says arguments is also disallowed...
[05:16:39] <daslicht> which is your favourite Gallery Plugin ?
[05:16:52] <daslicht> heya Cork, long time no see :)
[05:16:54] <daslicht> I am back
[05:17:59] <Cork> seutje: not sure how you got that
[05:18:12] <Cork> arguments works just fine in strict mode
[05:18:25] <Cork> but you my only use the argument list nothing else
[05:19:32] <seutje> just opened my chromesie console and pasted it
[05:20:02] <Cork> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/7tR67/
[05:20:11] <Cork> ya the output is wrong
[05:20:15] <seutje> fiddle wraps in a window onload function
[05:20:24] <Cork> doesn't matter
[05:20:28] <Cork> again look in the console
[05:20:59] <seutje> oh, ur points is the arguments object itself
[05:21:06] <Cork> yes
[05:21:14] <Cork> chromes error message is wrong
[05:21:18] <Cork> cause arugments is fine
[05:21:27] <Cork> they even allow it
[05:21:38] <Cork> hmm
[05:21:53] <seutje> weird, now I still get the error without a function wrapper
[05:22:02] <seutje> guess it's cause console evals?
[05:22:20] <Cork> well you set your console to strict mode :)
[05:22:48] <Cork> if you run the string without a wrapper it sets the current scope in strict mode
[05:22:54] <seutje> no I mean if you just go "use strict"; without a IIFE, it won't care about strict mode
[05:23:08] <Cork> it does here
[05:23:33] <Cork> hmm
[05:23:35] <Cork> but not in chrome
[05:23:37] <Cork> interesting
[05:23:43] <seutje> think it evals
[05:23:54] <Cork> no it must do something more
[05:24:04] <Cork> cause even eval cares about use strict
[05:24:11] <Cork> or at least should
[05:24:13] <seutje> lol
[05:24:22] <seutje> yeah, eval('"use strict"; function lol() { return arguments.callee;} lol();') does throw it
[05:24:37] <seutje> but "use strict"; function lol() { return arguments.callee;} lol(); doesn't
[05:24:40] <seutje> funky
[05:24:58] <Cork> what does that call give you btw?
[05:25:09] <Cork> you don't have a function so what value is callee?
[05:25:29] <Cork> or right
[05:25:34] <Cork> sorry mixed it up with caller
[05:26:02] <Cork> haven't used any of those for ages...
[05:31:23] <WrinkledCheese> I'm trying to make an element take up the remaining height at the bottom of the document.  According to the docs, $('#parentElement').height() - ($('#myElement').offset().top - $('#parentElement').offset().top) + 'px' should work.
[05:31:41] <WrinkledCheese> However, #myElement is returning offset().top 0
[05:31:47] <WrinkledCheese> I can't figure out why
[05:31:52] <WrinkledCheese> Any ideas?
[05:32:15] <Cork> WrinkledCheese: a few but it would help if you had a link
[05:32:24] <WrinkledCheese> Closed network
[05:32:39] <Cork> ex. you could have display: inline; on myElement
[05:32:55] <WrinkledCheese> No, it's tbody display:block.
[05:32:55] <Cork> there is a few other reasons, but ya seeing is needed
[05:33:04] <Cork> ?g jsfiddle.net
[05:33:06] <b-ot> Cork: JSFiddle: Create a new fiddle â†’ http://jsfiddle.net/
[05:36:32] <WrinkledCheese> Cork, I figured it out.  The ajax call had not come back so the empty element had no offset.  Doesn't make sense that an empty element doesn't have an offset.
[05:36:57] <Cork> WrinkledCheese: might be the element wasn't in the dom yet?
[05:37:04] <Cork> cause no an empty element do have an offset
[05:37:27] <WrinkledCheese> So an empty element isn't in the dom?
[05:37:33] <Cork> it is
[05:37:36] <WrinkledCheese> I can see it in the Firefox DOM inspector
[05:37:46] <Cork> but if you create a new element but haven't appended it to the dom it doens't have an offset
[05:38:02] <Cork> so agan reproduce it in a fiddle so we can look at it
[05:38:47] <WrinkledCheese> I fixed it, I put the height setting in the ajax success callback
[05:39:02] <WrinkledCheese> The element was empty
[05:39:12] <Cork> again empty does't matter
[05:39:18] <WrinkledCheese> Hmm
[05:39:39] <erebel55> what would be the best way to have my arrow rotate back to facing left on the second click, back to right on the 3rd click, etc. ?
[05:39:44] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/erebel55/QrcG2/
[05:39:44] <WrinkledCheese> I will post it on jFiddle I guess
[05:39:51] <erebel55> should I use toggle?
[05:40:20] <Cork> erebel55: have the css in a the stylesheet and toggle a class
[05:40:30] <Cork> no need to have the css in js
[05:41:01] <Cork> and it would simplify the code a lot
[05:42:28] <erebel55> Cork: so toggle between two classes, one for 0 degrees and one for 180 degees?
[05:42:31] <erebel55> I didn't think of that
[05:42:35] <Cork> yes
[05:42:53] <Cork> transision ftw
[05:42:53] <mithenks> hi
[05:43:20] <erebel55> Cork: thank you, will look for a good toggle example
[05:43:39] <Cork> erebel55: give me a min
[05:44:05] <erebel55> Cork: :)
[05:47:32] <decx> erebel55 http://jsfiddle.net/QrcG2/4/
[05:48:12] <Cork> erebel55: http://jsfiddle.net/QrcG2/5/
[05:48:20] <decx> faster ^^
[05:48:37] <decx> aww you added a toggle, teachers pet
[05:48:38] <Cork> well you use animate not transision
[05:49:58] <Cork> decx: also yours doesn't work in android browsers
[05:50:08] <Cork> as they still have the -webkit prefix
[05:50:14] <erebel55> Cork: thank you :) looks a lot nicer than what I had
[05:50:30] <Cork> erebel55: css animation for the win :)
[05:50:37] <decx> yeah but addid -webkit, -ms, -o, -moz prefixes would have taken too long ;)
[05:50:50] <Cork> you only need webkit
[05:50:51] <decx> as you have to do it for every keyframe rule
[05:50:57] <Cork> the other one has already moved away from the prefix
[05:51:09] <decx> there's always someone with firefox 3
[05:51:21] <Cork> uh ff3 doesn't support transform so...
[05:51:47] <Cork> (at all i mean)
[05:52:03] <Cork> also ff < 24 isn't supported
[05:52:16] <Cork> while the android one is still the latest version
[05:53:04] <Cork> btw and ms never used the prefix for those at all
[05:54:40] <decx> well now you're just nitpicking ;)
[05:54:51] <Cork> na
[05:55:06] <Cork> if i would be nitpicking i would argue that prefixes isn't supported at all anymore :)
[05:55:32] <decx> well good job me for not adding prefixes at all ;)
[05:57:48] <mithenks> Hi, I've a question: when I insert some html code in a div using $('#id').html(htmlCode), if there is javascript code in htmlCode it's executed by jquery?
[05:58:04] <Cork> mitchdotpro: yes it is
[05:58:29] <Cork> note though that document.write doesn't work in how jquery runs it
[05:59:44] <mithenks> ok perfect
[05:59:52] <seutje> Cork, decx: http://jsfiddle.net/QrcG2/6/ :P
[06:00:15] <Cork> seutje: except it doens't toggle :)
[06:00:26] <seutje> nope, gotta click next to it to toggle back
[06:00:38] <Cork> no i need to press the button on it
[06:00:49] <Cork> as soon as i let go it rotates back
[06:00:54] <seutje> weird
[06:00:55] <seutje> FF?
[06:00:58] <Cork> ya
[06:01:00] <seutje> ah
[06:01:11] <seutje> bastard fox doesn't retain active :(
[06:01:33] <decx> focus in that way only works in ff if you add a hidden input and do :focus ~
[06:01:38] <decx> #arrow *
[06:01:41] <decx> something like that
[06:01:41] <seutje> had this problem before, making a JS-less slideshow
[06:01:44] <decx> i can never remember
[06:02:41] <mithenks> now my problem is: when I inject js code this way, and in that code an error is found, the window.onerror function that I use to intercept and log errors tells me the main html page as source of error, and not the source from where I load the code. i.e. if I load some come with an ajax call and then inject it in a div, I'm not able to determine the initial source file where the error comes from
[06:02:58] <Cork> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/QrcG2/7/
[06:03:07] <mithenks> is there a way in jquery to "test" some htmlCode, and check if there are errors in it?
[06:03:19] <Cork> mithenks: not really
[06:03:26] <Cork> the dom doesn't provide a validator
[06:03:34] <seutje> Cork: oh lol, I was trying it with -1 earlier, upsie
[06:03:51] <Cork> seutje: now it works in all browsers too :)
[06:03:58] <seutje> u could make it toggle btw
[06:04:09] <seutje> just z-index something above it so ur clicking that :P
[06:04:17] <Cork> true
[06:04:40] <analphabet> hey there, Is there a way I can install jquery through component (http://github.com/component)
[06:04:46] <Cork> won't work on ie though
[06:04:46] <analphabet> ?
[06:04:50] <Cork> click through doesn't work there
[06:06:39] <aQuestion> Hello again, I'm following examples from a book - and it mentions the toggle() function. As toggle(function1, function2, ...)... however, when I try this it doesn't work. And when I look at the jquery website it seems to refer to something else
[06:06:49] <aQuestion> Was the toggle() method I'm talking of deprecated recently?
[06:08:16] <Cork> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/QrcG2/9/
[06:08:17] <Cork> :)
[06:08:20] <seutje> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/QrcG2/8/ why wouldn't it work on IE?
[06:08:37] <Cork> seutje: that would
[06:09:01] <seutje> enough dicking around
[06:09:05] <seutje> back to the tickets
[06:09:07] <Cork> :)
[06:10:12] <aQuestion> And another thing, I've been browsing stackoverflow... some people use function myFunc(), and then call myFunc directly in jQuery functions which take functions as arguments. Whereas other people do $.myFunc = function() { ..., and call $.myFunc later on
[06:10:17] <aQuestion> Which is the preferred way?
[06:10:35] <aQuestion> I assume $.myFunc because it is strictly jQuery as opposed to a normal javascript function
[06:10:39] <Cork> aquaone: depends on what you want to do
[06:10:54] <Cork> the second is meant to be used from plugins
[06:11:03] <aQuestion> Oh?
[06:11:05] <Cork> for not from
[06:11:28] <aQuestion> I was just wanting to use a clean way to stick functions in to the toggle() arguments
[06:11:36] <Cork> so when you want to expose a generic function from a plugin you use $.<api-name>
[06:11:39] <aQuestion> But it looks like toggle was deprecated recently
[06:12:02] <aQuestion> Cork: so just for my own usage, I should do it the javascript way?
[06:12:13] <aQuestion> Or is it the "dot" notation which is for plugins?
[06:12:31] <Cork> $ <-- jquery
[06:12:38] <Cork> it isn't meant to generic functions
[06:12:57] <Cork> so what you attach to to should be for public apis
[06:13:02] <aQuestion> Okay, say you were using .hover
[06:13:02] <Cork> not for site specific functions
[06:13:13] <aQuestion> how would you apply the functions to the 2 arguments?
[06:13:26] <Cork> i rarely use hover as i use :hover instead
[06:13:26] <aQuestion> I think it looks ugly to do it in-line as anonymous functions
[06:13:32] <Cork> but i would just use inline functions
[06:13:44] <Cork> or have an object i attach it to
[06:13:52] <Cork> ex. window.app or something
[06:14:01] <aQuestion> If you weren't doing it as an inline function, how would you define the function and pass it as an argument?
[06:14:20] <Cork> aquaone: they are still anonymous if you attache them to $
[06:14:20] <kammp> can I stop this interval by pressing keyCode 32 again? http://jsfiddle.net/gjh2s/
[06:14:37] <Cork> kammp: no
[06:14:44] <Cork> you need to store the timer id
[06:14:57] <Cork> then you can call clearInterval
[06:15:23] <Cork> kammp: also i would recommend using requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval
[06:15:35] <Cork> ?mdn requestAnimationFrame
[06:15:36] <b-ot> Cork: Window.requestAnimationFrame() - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame
[06:16:19] <Cork> (and i would use setTimeout as a fallback for browsers that doesn't support it)
[06:16:44] <aQuestion> Cork: just to humour me, would you do something like this? http://www.pastebin.ca/2577682
[06:17:05] <aQuestion> If you weren't going to define it in-line, that is
[06:17:18] <Cork> aQuestion: no cause i don't like polluting the public scope
[06:17:26] <aQuestion> Just to humour me
[06:17:37] <Cork> *global*
[06:17:46] <aQuestion> Because I don't like the idea of defining in-line within the function, like hover() for example
[06:17:59] <Cork> aQuestion: that is fine
[06:18:20] <aQuestion> Okay, thanks
[06:18:40] <unseensoul> Hi
[06:18:45] <aQuestion> What about declaring functions as variables in javascript
[06:18:57] <michael_19901> hey guys, i dont know why if i catch 'mousewheel' event (or 'DOMMouseScroll' in case of firefox) on window element, and stop it there, the content of children does not get scrolled
[06:19:03] <aQuestion> is there any preference (generally speaking) or reason to do it that way over the one in my paste bin?
[06:19:17] <aQuestion> again, for the purposes of passing to a function like hover()
[06:19:28] <Cork> aQuestion: http://jsfiddle.net/84aHT/
[06:19:47] <unseensoul> Having, form = $('#users-form'); what's the different between form.submit(); and form[0].submit();?
[06:19:59] <Cork> aQuestion: not really
[06:20:06] <Asmooh> hi, i have json data with onlick and/or ahref in it.. but i cant click on it
[06:20:07] <Asmooh> why.
[06:20:15] <Cork> expect if you want to pass variables to the scope
[06:20:22] <aQuestion> Cork: what's in your jsfiddle looks quite clean, I like that style
[06:20:30] <aQuestion> Is there a name for that?
[06:20:37] <Cork> Asmooh: json isn't js
[06:20:46] <Cork> Asmooh: it explisitly forbids js
[06:20:59] <Asmooh> well i do a ajax call and get json data back
[06:21:05] <Cork> aQuestion: not that i know of no
[06:21:19] <Cork> compartmentalizing?
[06:21:19] <aQuestion> what is window.app called?
[06:21:25] <Cork> a global variable
[06:21:30] <aQuestion> Okay, I'll run with that :)
[06:21:34] <Cork> app can be what ever you like
[06:21:42] <aQuestion> Thanks for your help
[06:21:45] <Cork> as long as it doens't conflict with something in the global scope
[06:21:46] <aQuestion> Much appreciated
[06:21:54] <Asmooh> Cork, its the first time ever i have this problem.. strange thing it only happens on main page and not on any other page
[06:21:54] <Asmooh> :/
[06:21:55] <aQuestion> Oh one other thing... how long ago was toggle() deprecated?
[06:22:06] <Cork> aQuestion: 1.8
[06:22:13] <aQuestion> cheers
[06:22:17] <aQuestion> take care
[06:22:30] <Asmooh> maybe i just ask to much of it :)
[06:22:36] <Cork> Asmooh: are you sending html in a json variable?
[06:22:44] <Cork> or what do you mean by onclick?
[06:22:56] <Cork> (also don't use inline event attributes)
[06:22:59] <Asmooh> Cork, yeah because i just in on my div
[06:23:09] <Cork> they cause a lot of bugs that are nasty to handle
[06:23:12] <Asmooh> $row_array['clicklink'] = "onclick=\"javascript:location.href='/$clink/$slink/$blink$put_newproducts[productlink]'\"";
[06:23:14] <Asmooh> like this
[06:23:20] <Cork> ugg...
[06:23:43] <michael_19901> so what about the scrollwheel event, stopping propagating the event on $(window) prevents children from scrolling, though the event would bubble up ?
[06:23:45] <Asmooh> yeah i know
[06:23:55] <Cork> Asmooh: that is even redundant event handler...
[06:24:05] <Cork> Asmooh: you don't need javascript: for event attributes
[06:24:06] <Asmooh> otherwise i just need to send the last part and just put the onclick in the div it self
[06:24:19] <Cork> at least unless you don't plan to support pre 2000 browsers
[06:24:26] <Cork> *unless you plan to
[06:24:43] <Asmooh> well.. $row_array['artposted'] = "<a href=\"/$clink/$slink/$blink$put_newproducts[productlink]\" data-ajax=\"false\"><img src=\"/css/images/brands/$put_subcat[brandicon]\" width=\"130\" height=\"130\"/></a>"; <<< doesnt work either.. nothing to click on
[06:24:48] <Cork> Asmooh: you should look into separating the js from the html
[06:24:52] <Asmooh> hm
[06:24:56] <Cork> it makes things much easier to handle
[06:25:12] <Asmooh> will try :)
[06:25:25] <Cork> if you do it right you can even move the js to be static
[06:25:36] <Cork> and just have the html hold the data js needs to act
[06:25:57] <Cork> that will give you performance boosts too
[06:26:11] <Cork> as the jitted code can be reused
[06:29:44] <michael_19901> so what about the scrollwheel stuff
[06:29:55] <michael_19901> anyone got any clue why this behaviour happens ?
[06:30:38] <Cork> michael_19901: "scrollwheel stuff"?
[06:31:22] <michael_19901> trying to stop propagation of the event
[06:31:35] <michael_19901> on $(window) prevents the actual children target from scrolling
[06:31:40] <michael_19901> thought the event would bubble...
[06:31:49] <michael_19901> the event gets invoked first on child element though
[06:31:54] <michael_19901> weird
[06:32:29] <michael_19901> basically i have an iframe and i want to prevent scrolling of the encapsulating document, thought attaching #iframe event would be enough, but then again, the sub-windows in iframe dont scroll
[06:32:41] <michael_19901> it stops the encapsulating page of the iframe from scrolling though
[06:33:27] <michael_19901> cork: any clue ?
[06:34:00] <Cork> michael_19901: prevent bubbling on window?
[06:34:10] <Cork> window is the last element in the bubble order
[06:34:14] <michael_19901> yeah, the <iframe>
[06:34:29] <Cork> events doesn't bubble outside of an iframe
[06:34:54] <michael_19901> they do, scroll does
[06:35:03] <Asmooh> hm well cork this doesnt really make it work either: onClick="javascript:location.href='+data[k].clicklink+'"   and  $row_array['clicklink'] = "/$clink/$put_subcat[subcategorielink]";
[06:35:06] <Asmooh> dunno why
[06:35:36] <Cork> Asmooh: that is still inline
[06:35:48] <Asmooh> huh? i only give the link
[06:35:52] <Asmooh> oooh
[06:35:53] <Cork> i talk about $(document).on('click', 'selector', function() {})
[06:35:58] <michael_19901> split html and javascript first dude
[06:36:01] <Cork> instead of adding the js in the html
[06:36:06] <Asmooh> sorry, the html is a div :)
[06:36:07] <michael_19901> why you make it inline, its very tough to do anything this way
[06:36:20] <Cork> also it will break easily
[06:36:22] <Asmooh> 	$('#contentpopcat').append('<div class="blok" style="width: 150px; height: 150px; float: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 10px;" onClick="javascript:location.href='+data[k].clicklink+'">'+data[k].articaltitle+'<br /><span style="font-size: 10px;">'+data[k].artposted+'</span></div>');
[06:36:24] <Asmooh> lke this
[06:36:27] <Asmooh> like*
[06:36:34] * Cork shivers
[06:36:42] <Asmooh> hm :(
[06:36:44] <michael_19901> split styles into styles, scripts into scripts, and html into html
[06:36:51] * BinaryKitten wraps Cork in a "my first day" blanket
[06:36:57] <michael_19901> you just waste time making one huge unreadable chunk of code
[06:37:00] <Asmooh> i did but that didnt work well michael_19901 thats why i moved it back again
[06:38:04] <michael_19901> you will not be able to develop anything efficiently
[06:38:09] <michael_19901> go split it again
[06:38:12] <michael_19901> do bit by bit
[06:38:15] <michael_19901> not all at once
[06:38:47] <michael_19901> $('#contentpopcat').append('<div class="blok" class="blabla" onClick="javascript:location.href='+data[k].clicklink+'">'+data[k].articaltitle+'<br /><span style="font-size: 10px;">'+data[k].artposted+'</span></div>');
[06:38:52] <michael_19901> much more readable
[06:39:24] <decx> two classes :o
[06:39:26] <BinaryKitten> why have onclick?
[06:39:30] <Cork> ya
[06:39:31] <decx> onlick :o
[06:39:35] <Cork> the inline js is the big problem...
[06:39:36] <Asmooh> because ahref didnt work either :P
[06:39:37] <decx> style :o
[06:39:54] <Cork> there is actually use for inline style
[06:40:03] <Cork> but not event attrubtes
[06:40:07] <Cork> *attributes
[06:40:15] <michael_19901> dude dont do onclick=""
[06:40:26] <decx> why not just use <small instead of span if it's supposed to be small ;)
[06:40:27] <Asmooh> but maybe i can try something as onclick=¨clickit(linktoproduct)¨ ?
[06:40:29] <michael_19901> do $document).ready(function(){ ......});
[06:40:33] <BinaryKitten> $('<a>', {href: data[k].clicklink, text: data[k].articaltitle}).appendTo('#contentpopcat');
[06:40:50] <Cork> Asmooh: just split the js out into a separate script tag
[06:40:59] <Cork> attach it with event listeners and have debuggable code
[06:41:02] <BinaryKitten> yep definitely do as cork said
[06:41:24] <Cork> if the script tag is loaded from a .js file or is inline in the page doesn't really matter
[06:41:38] <Cork> as long as you don't spread it on 100+ different places...
[06:41:50] <Cork> (or 10+ honestly...)
[06:42:11] <Asmooh> hmm
[06:43:52] <michael_19901> BinaryKitten: how to stop scrollwheel event on the iframe, to prevent encapsulating page from scrolling, whilst allowing children elements within iframe to scroll
[06:44:02] <michael_19901> e.preventDefault() does block everything
[06:44:23] <BinaryKitten> urm
[06:44:39] <michael_19901> heres a riddle for you :O
[06:45:02] <BinaryKitten> so you want to break basic functionality for a parent item but not for the children
[06:45:36] <michael_19901> yea
[06:45:44] <Cork> BinaryKitten: remember its an iframe (not the same document)
[06:45:55] <michael_19901> basically i attach $(document).on(events, function(){})
[06:45:59] <michael_19901> and i can prevent scrolling
[06:46:14] <michael_19901> of the outer, encapsulating page (im building a widget)
[06:46:34] <michael_19901> but then if i stop that the children elements of the iframe itself dont scroll, even though their handlers get invoked first, im soo frustrated
[06:47:03] <michael_19901> normal behaviour is that if you scroll the iframe, and you hit the edge, you start scrolling the parent website
[06:47:13] <Cork> michael_19901: you can't count on controlling the parent page from an iframe
[06:47:19] <Cork> as the browser often will block that
[06:47:30] <michael_19901> actually i can do that already
[06:47:32] <Cork> so you can only prevent your own document from scrolling not the parent
[06:47:38] <michael_19901> but it also blocks scrolling the children :/
[06:47:39] <BinaryKitten> especially if they're different domains
[06:47:42] <Cork> so the iframe is loade from the same domain?
[06:47:46] <michael_19901> no
[06:47:49] <Cork> then you can't
[06:47:57] <Cork> you have no js access to the parent
[06:48:07] <BinaryKitten> michael_19901 use css
[06:48:14] <michael_19901> hows that then ?
[06:48:19] <BinaryKitten> overflow: hidden ?
[06:48:20] <BinaryKitten> :p
[06:48:36] <Asmooh> pfffff
[06:48:48] <michael_19901> yeah this cannot be done in my case :D
[06:49:08] <michael_19901> anyway thanks guys
[06:49:16] <xqo> is this how you use OR in switch? http://jsfiddle.net/38gFQ/
[06:50:13] <sddo> yeah, basically
[06:50:39] <michael_19901> yeah
[06:50:41] <michael_19901> dont forget break;
[06:50:53] <michael_19901> why not just use if 'j' || 'join'
[06:51:29] <michael_19901> actually if like === 'j' || line === 'join'
[06:58:26] <Asmooh> well i think i know why my onclick doesnt work anyway, because im not allowed to use words in the parameter, only numbers
[06:58:29] <Asmooh> i think at least
[06:59:10] <Asmooh> hm no doesnt matter
[07:24:23] <b0ss_> I'm writing a backend system admin which is supposed to call URLs through AJAX. Currently, what's the best approach: native AJAX or jQuery or whatever ?
[07:24:51] <anli__> Can I prepend a number of li to a ul in a batch?
[07:34:09] <erebel55> can animation and transition occur at the same time?
[07:38:36] <NoiseEee> b0ss_: might as well use a library, and here, might as well use jquery :)
[07:38:47] <NoiseEee> anli__: sure?
[07:39:25] <Mike11123> Good afternoon jquery...
[07:40:23] <anli__> NoiseEee: Those are created by a number of $8
[07:40:27] <anli__> oops
[07:40:33] <anli__> NoiseEee: Those are created by a number of $('<li/>'); calls
[07:41:24] <NoiseEee> anli__: move them where you like
[07:41:27] <Mike11123> has anyone successfully integrated jQuery into Symfony2?  I am submitting an AJAX request to a controller and generating the proper response.  But after returning the response I get a white screen with the JSON string in it instead of the original view...
[07:41:37] <anli__> NoiseEee: I only want to prepend them
[07:41:42] <b0ss_> NoiseEee: do you use native AJAX or jQuery ?
[07:42:17] <anli__> NoiseEee: I inserted them manually instead btw
[07:42:17] <NoiseEee> anli__: which means "insert into the DOM", so figure out where to do so. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/ /  http://api.jquery.com/insertbefore/  /  http://api.jquery.com/before/
[07:42:26] <anli__> One by one
[07:42:37] <anli__> The question was how to do it in a batch instead of one by one
[07:42:40] <NoiseEee> b0ss_: jquery, its a no-brainer really
[07:43:11] <NoiseEee> anli__: read the docs on .prepend()
[07:43:17] <BillCriswell> erebel55: Yup
[07:43:25] <anli__> I think I am content with the solution to do it manually, but thanks
[07:44:02] <erebel55> BillCriswell: hm must be a different issue then, what about two toggleClass calls from the same event?
[07:44:03] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/erebel55/sPsa3/3/
[07:44:44] <erebel55> when I click on the arrow for some reason it doesn't rotate slowly
[07:46:01] <erebel55> I want it to rotate slowly like it does here http://jsfiddle.net/erebel55/sPsa3/
[07:50:43] <BillCriswell> erebel55: I thought you were talking about CSS.
[07:50:57] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/OyOcAtoL/1/edit is what I based my answer off of.
[07:53:11] <BillCriswell> erebel55: I guess it doesn't. =(
[07:53:48] <Cork> erebel55: looks like jquery ui does something funky
[07:54:24] <Cork> erebel55: though again, you could do that with css :)
[07:56:07] <mithenks> when I get an exception in a code loaded through an ajx call, I see something like this: at addKeyboard (eval at <anonymous> (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8/jquery.js:564:22), <anonymous>:218:25)
[07:56:18] <BillCriswell> Yeah, get all CSS up in that shit.
[07:56:24] <mithenks> why I'm getting this <anonymous> ?
[07:56:53] <BillCriswell> I dunno.
[07:57:16] <BillCriswell> Oh, anonymous function.
[07:57:22] <BillCriswell> I thoguht someone on IRC was messaging you.
[07:57:42] <Cork> mithenks: you load a script through ajax
[07:57:53] <Cork> and jquery uses eval to validate the script code
[07:58:16] <luke_66> hi everyone
[07:58:33] <luke_66> I have a question about jquery-ui and sorting
[07:58:36] <mithenks> yes but row and column when the error raises are correct
[07:58:45] <mithenks> why I can't get also the filename?
[08:00:05] <Cork> mithenks: cause there isn't one
[08:00:18] <Cork> you load text from the server and then in js evaluate it
[08:00:24] <Cork> there is no connection to the source
[08:00:50] <mithenks> Cork are you sure? So why row and column numbers are correct?
[08:01:24] <Cork> mitchdotpro: the row and column is relative to the source it loaded + the offset to jquery globalEval function (depending on browser)
[08:02:14] <Cork> *mithenks:
[08:02:18] <Cork> mithenks: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L265
[08:02:28] <Cork> that is what handles the code
[08:04:17] <mithenks> Cork thanks, I will read more about this in jquery docs/code
[08:04:27] <erebel55> BillCriswell, Cork: oh okay, darn :/
[08:04:46] <unseensoul> Hi
[08:05:22] <Cork> erebel55: it is most likely solvable, but i would have to look into what css the ui changes on the page
[08:05:53] <Cork> erebel55: but like i said, the simple sliding you use there can easily be done with css3
[08:06:48] <unseensoul> Having, form = $('#users-form'); what's the different between form.submit(); and form[0].submit();?
[08:07:14] <Cork> unseensoul: the second one calls submit on the element
[08:07:27] <Cork> while the first one does a .trigger('submit')
[08:07:39] <luke_66> I have this table. I want to make rows sortable, but in this table two tr treated as a single row. Is it possible to match two contigous tr and treat them as a single sortable element?
[08:07:52] <luke_66> http://jsfiddle.net/LUsRQ/
[08:08:57] <unseensoul> Cork, thanks :)
[08:09:21] <b0ss_> is it jQuery written solely in Javascript?
[08:09:40] <Cork> b0ss_: if you mean the releasing product yes
[08:09:49] <BillCriswell> What Cork said.
[08:10:29] <Cork> b0ss_: it goes through a compilation phase, and the code before that has things that isn't js
[08:10:59] <Cork> b0ss_: and jquery is just a framework that makes js easier to write
[08:11:06] <SamuraiDio> does jQuery has some native implementation for file uploads? (use an iframe in place of AJAX, process json/xml response, execute callback)?
[08:11:07] <Cork> it doesn't do anything normal js can't
[08:11:32] <Cork> SamuraiDio: not in core no
[08:11:53] <Cork> SamuraiDio: if you can accept not supporting old ie you could use FormData
[08:11:57] <Cork> ?mdn FormData
[08:11:59] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[08:12:16] <luke_66> any help?
[08:12:21] <Cork> it works fine with jquery.ajax
[08:12:58] <Cork> luke_66: i think you would have to have a common parent to group them
[08:13:00] <b0ss_> Cork: so some statements we see in the .js file are not regular Javascript, right ?
[08:13:20] <Cork> b0ss_: no
[08:13:29] <Cork> every thing you see in the .js files is native js
[08:13:39] <SamuraiDio> Cork, byt "old ie", you mean? 7-?
[08:14:18] <SamuraiDio> Cork, just checked browser suppor on lnked page
[08:14:31] <Cork> SamuraiDio: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData#Browser_compatibility
[08:14:43] <Cork> YA
[08:14:45] <Cork> opps
[08:15:07] <b0ss_> Furthermore: does it group everything in strutctures (I won't call them classes for now) ?
[08:15:20] <Cork> SamuraiDio: like the link shows ie10 is the first ie browser supported
[08:15:33] <SamuraiDio> I see
[08:16:04] <Cork> b0ss_: all the commands in the jquery framework is attached to the jQuery object yes
[08:16:15] <Cork> except for a few hidden internal commands
[08:21:14] <Asmooh> found the issue
[08:21:21] <Asmooh> navbar did something strange :)
[08:21:25] <erebel55> Cork: right that makes sense, I will search around and see if I can find a solution for not doing it all in css. I appreciate the help.
[08:22:57] <unseensoul> Cork, I was wondering ... wouldn't form[0].submit also trigger the submit event response if defined? For instance,  form.on('submit', function(){});
[08:23:22] <Cork> unseensoul: nope
[08:23:26] <Cork> that is the difference
[08:23:44] <Cork> elm.submit() is a dom function
[08:23:50] <Cork> it actually submits the form
[08:24:08] <Cork> while jquerys submit() is a shorthand for jquerys trigger('submit')
[08:24:26] <Cork> that runs jquerys fake event code
[08:25:16] <pu239> don't know if this really falls under a jquery question, but here goes, i'm using asp.net mvc4, using Ajax.Beginform to create a form, if i get an error on the submit, how can i return an error back to the user?
[08:25:48] <Cork> pu239: doesn't sounds the least related no
[08:25:55] <Cork> try asking in a .net channel
[08:26:11] <erebel55> Cork: this should probably be logged as a bug if it already hasn't
[08:26:16] <b0ss_> hey what about that one: "Heavy usage of AJAX functions often cause server overload due to the greater number of connections made." Source: http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-jquery-and-ajax/#ixzz2rEuwwa5R    ???
[08:26:32] <Cork> pu239: ##asp.net
[08:26:44] <pu239> Cork: thanks
[08:26:58] <Cork> erebel55: not sure how aware jquery ui is of css3
[08:27:10] <Cork> erebel55: but ya might be
[08:27:43] <Cork> i don't see animations important enough to allow js to do it
[08:28:26] <erebel55> Cork: yea, I'm sure you are right. I'm still a noob
[08:29:53] <Cork> erebel55: i'm sure many don't agree
[08:30:58] <erebel55> Cork: ah, yea web dev seems so flexible so far, it is scary.
[08:31:14] <erebel55> Cork: I think I found someone else who had the issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8205189/css3-transitions-with-toggleclass
[08:31:18] <erebel55> still working my way through it
[08:31:23] <unseensoul> Cork, so you're saying that statements like form.on('submit', function(){}); won't result in real event handlers by using AddEventListener in the background for instance? So it seems to me that clicking on the submit button has the same event of calling form.submit()?
[08:32:09] <Cork> erebel55: no that looks like something completely different
[08:32:53] <Cork> unseensoul: the problem is that you think submit() always implies triggering events
[08:33:11] <Cork> unseensoul: the dom has to support for triggering submit events
[08:33:30] <Cork> unseensoul: so jquery has a separate channel beside the native event queue
[08:33:54] <Cork> unseensoul: when you do .trigger('submit') it loops over the parents in the page and checks for event listeners it knows of
[08:34:03] <Cork> and then calls those functions
[08:34:19] <Cork> that is how you get the "feel" of a faked submit event
[08:34:33] <Cork> unseensoul: while dom.submit() has nothing to do with events
[08:34:48] <Mike11123> anybody know why this http://pastebin.com/SMbStuuB is returning a white screen instead of the page that already loaded?
[08:34:48] <Cork> it is a function you call when you want to submit a form
[08:35:11] <Cork> Mike11123: "This paste has been removed!"
[08:35:19] <Mike11123> oops...thnx
[08:35:50] <Mike11123> http://pastebin.com/p5DX59AH
[08:36:42] <Cork> Mike11123: impossible to say
[08:36:54] <erebel55> Cork: oh okay, darn
[08:37:00] <Cork> you would have to generate a fiddle so one can see the code running
[08:37:38] <Cork> erebel55: i suspect it is something with the css updates the js animations does that aborts the css animations
[08:37:46] <Cork> erebel55: but it's just me guessing
[08:38:11] <Cork> erebel55: an alternative is to ditch the transform and use jquery.animate
[08:38:15] <Cork> kinda sad but...
[08:38:36] <Cork> erebel55: opps meant transision not transform :o
[08:39:35] <erebel55> okay, right. It is good to know my options.
[08:39:39] <erebel55> I think this may be the same problem http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17518258/css-transitions-not-working-after-toggleclass
[08:40:34] <Cork> erebel55: toggleClass isn't the problem
[08:40:41] <Cork> it is the slide from jquery ui
[08:42:35] <erebel55> oh okay
[08:43:15] <Cork> erebel55: i just saw what happens
[08:43:26] <Cork> slide wrapps the element in a new parent
[08:43:49] <Cork> effectively aborts the transition cause the element is removed
[08:44:05] <hesco> I have some jquery code which works fine under manual exploratory testing, all built on this selector:  $('#list_options [type=radio]:not(:checked)').change();  However, when I drop the exact same markup into the qunit-fixture div of the qunit template, none of the [form_class].show() and .hide() stuff works and the unit tests written to exercise them (with .is(':visible')) mostly all fail (to be expected).  http://jsfiddle.net/#&togethe
[08:44:07] <hesco> rjs=56DHjgM8qj   Can anyone here please advise?
[08:44:15] <ShawnRisk> how do I change the height of the activity stream in Facebook Like Box?  I am trying to change the phm class and using similar code to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7694780/can-i-dynamically-resize-the-facebook-activity-stream-plugin
[08:44:23] <Cork> erebel55: an option you can do is have the animation start before the transition so that the element isn't removed from the dom
[08:44:47] <io_______> hi, if I do a $.get("URL", function(data) { }); how can i get a portion (given an ID for example) of that data ?
[08:45:06] <Cork> io_______: $(data).find('#id')
[08:46:46] <Cork> hesco: please separate the question from the explanation, that way it becomes MUCH easier to scan the test to find the useful info
[08:47:02] <Cork> hesco: also shorten the lines and split them up
[08:47:11] <Cork> makes it much easier to read
[08:47:16] <io_______> Cork: when I do var data1 = $(data).find( "#one");  data1 is an object why?
[08:47:37] <Cork> io_______: data1 is a jquery wrapped list of dom elements yes
[08:48:16] <io_______> Cork: how can I get just the html ?
[08:48:26] <Cork> io_______: you would have to use regex
[08:48:41] <Cork> or parse to dom > use jquery to parse it
[08:48:45] <Cork> then serialize the dom to html
[08:48:54] <io_______> Cork: isn t there an easier way to get a portion of html from data ?
[08:49:08] <Cork> io_______: you normally don't work with html in a page
[08:49:14] <SamuraiDio> Cork, It worked, Thanks for the help.
[08:49:20] <erebel55> Cork: thank you! :)
[08:49:38] <Cork> io_______: $('<div>').html($(data).find( "#one")).html()
[08:49:44] <decx> damn cork is cleaning house today, good job ^^
[08:49:57] <SamuraiDio> I just need to check if our clients can accept the browser compat
[08:50:04] <Cork> io_______: that will create a new div grab the dom elements append them to the div and then return the serialized content from the div
[08:50:13] <hesco> Cork:  are you asking me to do that with respect to my request here?  or for my code at the link?
[08:50:15] <Cork> decx: i usually do :)
[08:50:26] <io_______> Cork: i don t want a new div, just the html as a variable
[08:50:48] <Cork> hesco: it was help for how to ask questions on irc that is likely to be answered
[08:51:16] <hesco> Cork: My question was: Can anyone here please advise?
[08:51:27] <Cork> hesco: even your url was cropped, and i couldn't quickly find the question so i don't even know the question
[08:51:37] <Cork> hesco: that isn't a question it is a search
[08:51:46] <Cork> ?ask
[08:51:46] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:51:53] <hesco> and it seems intricately wrapped up in the 'explanation', what I think of as the context of that question.
[08:52:16] <Cork> well then you will have to wait for someone willing to parse that
[08:52:25] <hesco> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=56DHjgM8qj
[08:53:35] <hesco> the jquery interactions work fine at: http://fyeo.thefamilyconnector.com:8003/, but not when wrapped in the test framework as at the jsfiddle post
[08:55:47] <ShawnRisk> how do I change the height of the activity stream in Facebook Like Box?  I am trying to change the phm class in the fbook tab under slideshow in the fbook.js file.  I know the code loads dynamically which is hard to change but any ideas on how to do this?
[09:01:06] <ShawnRisk> seems quiet now
[09:01:34] <ShawnRisk> oops the site is: http://www.ecosanity.org
[09:02:59] <Cork> ShawnRisk: well i don't use facebook so can't help >_>
[09:03:27] <duch_kazatel> i just heard somebody say that IE11 is "based on opera".  I am so confused.
[09:03:29] <duch_kazatel> wtf does that even mean
[09:03:35] <prbc> When I use $(this), am I accessing DOM? Is it better assign to a variable if I'll use it many times?
[09:03:43] <Cork> duch_kazatel: that's a total lie
[09:03:50] <Cork> duch_kazatel: opera doesn't even exist anymore
[09:03:51] <duch_kazatel> prbc you're often accessing a DOM element, yes.
[09:03:55] <ShawnRisk> Cork: can't look at the other elements?
[09:03:58] <Cork> it is just a theme for chromium
[09:04:09] <duch_kazatel> Cork I pointed that out - Opera is now using Blink!
[09:04:11] <Cork> ShawnRisk: where is this element?
[09:04:27] <duch_kazatel> and they stuck to their guns.
[09:04:27] <Cork> duch_kazatel: it is using more then blonk
[09:04:33] <duch_kazatel> it was so wtf.
[09:04:34] <Cork> *4blink
[09:04:36] <Cork> BAH
[09:04:39] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[09:04:39] <Cork> *blink
[09:04:48] <duch_kazatel> did they go with more than just blink?
[09:04:53] <Cork> duch_kazatel: the new opera browser is a fork of chromium
[09:05:05] <ShawnRisk> Cork: on the site I put lower ecosanity, under slideshow, fbook tab.  The file I am using is fbook.js
[09:05:09] <duch_kazatel> i thought they just forked the rendering engine.  interesting.
[09:05:12] <ShawnRisk> Opera Browser is still around
[09:05:14] <Cork> it is literally a theme for chromium
[09:06:02] <duch_kazatel> fair enough.
[09:06:18] <prbc> duch_kazatel: Thanks
[09:06:23] <duch_kazatel> prbc sure.
[09:06:39] <ShawnRisk> Opera Browser is still there
[09:06:41] <duch_kazatel> I just kind of looked at him like "uuuuh wtf?"
[09:07:04] <Cork> ShawnRisk: only an old unsupported version
[09:07:11] <duch_kazatel> now i'm trying to figure out WHERE he got this idea.
[09:07:17] <nhulea> yo !
[09:07:30] <Cork> duch_kazatel: most likely just fud
[09:07:44] <duch_kazatel> i still want to know where though
[09:07:59] <duch_kazatel> because if that perpetuates, we're going to have a whole new world of pain here.
[09:08:16] <ShawnRisk> okay
[09:08:27] <ShawnRisk> Cork: any idea on my problem?
[09:08:35] <Cork> ShawnRisk: still looking
[09:08:39] <decx> ie11 is actually based on an opera, it's called "the late redemption of an ugly duckling"
[09:08:39] <lethjakman> hey, I've got some code that looks like this on a site: https://gist.github.com/lethjakman/8582596
[09:08:46] <lethjakman> but it says there's no method 'on'
[09:08:50] <lethjakman> that's pretty standard right?
[09:08:53] <duch_kazatel> decx where in the world did you hear this.
[09:09:00] <ShawnRisk> Cork: thanks
[09:09:00] <decx> i made it up
[09:09:09] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah hahaha i was about to say.
[09:09:26] <Cork> ShawnRisk: but as fb is blocked and doesn't load i don't think i see what you talk about
[09:09:43] <Cork> and ya, you really should talk with someone that codes with fb
[09:10:11] <duch_kazatel> lethjakman make sure jQuery("#menu-icon") actually matches something.
[09:10:17] <lethjakman> duch_kazatel: it does.
[09:10:24] <lethjakman> what version was .on added in
[09:10:30] <lethjakman> they have 1.7....
[09:10:31] <Cork> lethjakman: 1.9
[09:10:34] <duch_kazatel> wat
[09:10:42] <Cork> ?api on
[09:10:42] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:10:44] <duch_kazatel> 1.7 at least.
[09:10:53] <Cork> opps sorry
[09:10:53] <ShawnRisk> Cork: blocked?
[09:10:59] <Cork> ya was added in 1.7
[09:11:00] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/ - "As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method provides all functionality required..."
[09:11:10] <Cork> ShawnRisk: www.facebook.com
[09:11:23] <Cork> so the content form there just returns 404
[09:11:33] <ShawnRisk> Cork: oh on your computer
[09:11:35] <lethjakman> Cork: thank you
[09:11:42] <ShawnRisk> where do I find someone who works on Facebook?
[09:12:06] <decx> probably in some dark cave, hooked up to a machine like in the clockwork orange
[09:12:10] <Cork> ShawnRisk: i've seen some talk about it in here from time to time
[09:12:21] <Cork> ShawnRisk: ##javascript might have someone
[09:12:56] <ShawnRisk> looking thanks
[09:13:03] <Cork> ShawnRisk: there is ppl around, i just don't happen to be one of them ;)
[09:13:44] <ShawnRisk> ok
[09:13:55] <unseensoul> Cork, I still can't get my head around it :\
[09:14:18] <Cork> unseensoul: not sure what part about it is hard to understand
[09:14:52] <Cork> you know $() return an array like jquery object
[09:15:02] <Cork> where all the jquery functions live on
[09:15:14] <Cork> and jq[0] returns the raw dom element
[09:15:38] <Cork> so those two are two totally different things
[09:17:52] <unseensoul> Cork, I got that. I'm just confused about event handlers (in this case, form submission too).
[09:18:22] <Cork> unseensoul: the only thing is that dom.submit() doesn't call event handlers
[09:18:29] <Cork> ever
[09:19:13] <unseensoul> Cork, whether they are defined with .on or addEventListener?
[09:19:25] <Cork> yes
[09:19:52] <unseensoul> I'm getting a rather weird result then. Give me a sec.
[09:19:56] <Cork> and jq.submit() only works with .on (or .delegate, .bind and so on)
[09:20:12] <io_______> Cork: can i do something like var data1 = $(data).find( "#one").get(0); to get the raw html ?
[09:20:13] <Cork> not native event handlers
[09:20:21] <Cork> io_______: no
[09:20:27] <Cork> that would get the raw dom element
[09:20:41] <Cork> (not wrapped in jquery)
[09:20:52] <Cork> io_______: the browser dorens
[09:20:54] <Cork> opps
[09:21:02] <Cork> doesn't work with html
[09:21:13] <Cork> it works with an html stream when the page starts loading
[09:21:29] <Cork> as the streams comes in it parses it into dom elements
[09:21:48] <ShawnRisk> Cork: seems quiet in there
[09:21:55] <Cork> and when hyou do $(data) jquery asks the browser to convert the html to dom elements
[09:22:32] <Cork> ShawnRisk: or just not very many that works with facebook ^^'
[09:22:50] <Cork> you might have to be prepared to wait a while and ask a few times
[09:22:55] <duch_kazatel> more specifically, $('<div>markup markup markup</div>') creates a document fragment
[09:22:58] <io_______> Cork: just stepping back, what I am trying to achieve is to read an html file and get its content (part of it) on a variable
[09:23:45] <Cork> io_______: if you by content mean everything inside body
[09:23:53] <Cork> that is about the hardest things to do over ajax
[09:24:00] <io_______> Cork: no, the file is just some  markup
[09:24:08] <Cork> as loading a fragment with body is actually invalid
[09:24:21] <Cork> io_______: ok, lets back this up, why do you need the html?
[09:25:02] <ShawnRisk> Cork: How often should I ask?
[09:25:07] <io_______> Cork I am using a jqeury plugin for a slide show, there is an array where I can add some html code for each slide to show up   along
[09:25:31] <io_______> I d like to keep the html on a separate file for ease of use
[09:25:39] <unseensoul> Cork, http://pastebin.com/EBGZwn1m whether you click on the Submit or Click Me button, the event will be fired.
[09:25:39] <Cork> ShawnRisk: depends on how often your prepared to ask but i would say max once every 30 mins
[09:25:46] <io_______> instead of having a rather big chink of html within the script
[09:25:59] <duch_kazatel> io_______ your file should have just the fragment you need, instead of a whole document.
[09:26:07] <Cork> io_______: and your sure the slideshow plugin doesn't accept dom elements too?
[09:26:27] <Cork> and ya, the fragment should be filtered server side
[09:26:32] <io_______> Cork: let me resume my  code in a sec
[09:26:55] <Cork> it is kinda silly to filter out parts after you have already payed all the cost of getting it to the client
[09:27:01] <Cork> when you could just have filtered it server side
[09:27:13] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[09:27:17] <duch_kazatel> let the server do that part.
[09:27:46] <Cork> that is actually one of my big problems with .load
[09:28:05] <ShawnRisk> Cork: Why not here?
[09:28:07] <duch_kazatel> we make people use $.ajax() for any and all ajax-related stuff.
[09:28:22] <Cork> ShawnRisk: didn't say anything about what channel to ask in
[09:28:23] <Cork> :)
[09:28:43] <io_______> Cork: http://codepad.org/cTyjvxpb
[09:28:46] <Cork> ShawnRisk: just don't ask in two channels within 5 mins of eachother
[09:29:02] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk i might be able to take a crack - what's going on?
[09:29:10] <ShawnRisk> How to change the height of the activity stream in the facebook like box?
[09:29:32] <duch_kazatel> have a link to widget docs?
[09:29:43] <duch_kazatel> i vaguely remember working with that.
[09:30:01] <teasercss> Hi guys any idea why my window.open does not work http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rgDbA
[09:30:43] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: nope I don't.
[09:31:08] <duch_kazatel> could you go find it real quick?
[09:32:38] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: this one: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript or https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-box-for-pages#settings
[09:32:49] <teasercss> Hi guys any idea why my window.open does not work http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rgDbA ?
[09:33:22] <Cork> teasercss: cause jquery isn't loaded
[09:33:43] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk IF you can modify the height at all, it'll have to be by modifying the styles inside the iframe
[09:33:59] <teasercss> @Cork it since since I can see the alert message no ?
[09:34:07] <decx> can you even modify styles on iframes on a different domain?`
[09:34:08] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: styles inside the iframe with css?
[09:34:18] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk no, using jquery.
[09:34:26] <duch_kazatel> if that's even possible in this case, which it likely won't be.
[09:34:28] <decx> like $('iframe').contents().find('.classiniframe')
[09:34:44] <duch_kazatel> the second page you linked has a height param - that's about as good as it'll get for you.
[09:35:13] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I want to change the phm class and that is loaded dynamically
[09:35:14] <decx> it's probably easier to just pick up the activity stream for that url directly from the api instead of using the likebox iframe
[09:35:28] <unseensoul> Cork, did you see why I'm getting a different result?
[09:35:33] <duch_kazatel> i remember fighting against the facebook like button deal and eventually just gave up.
[09:35:33] <ShawnRisk> decx: link?
[09:35:38] <duch_kazatel> "phm class"?
[09:35:49] <Cork> unseensoul: think i missed the question
[09:36:09] <unseensoul> Cork, http://pastebin.com/EBGZwn1m whether you click on the Submit or Click Me button, the event will be fired.
[09:36:22] <unseensoul> No jQuery there.
[09:36:26] <Cork> io_______: ya, the documentation of supersized looks a bit thin sadly
[09:36:37] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: look at the site http://www.ecosanity.org under slideshow and in the fbook tab.  In the code within the iframe is the phm class which sets the height to 300 and need lower.
[09:37:13] <Cork> unseensoul: you know buttons is type="submit" by default right?
[09:37:16] <duch_kazatel> "phm"?
[09:37:18] <io_______> Cork: yes also my idea does not appply for the intended use, I need some moew html than the simple title
[09:37:38] <Cork> unseensoul: try <button type="button" onclick="">
[09:37:45] <io_______> so I am trying that isntead of trying ot hack into the plugin itself wich is a bit challenging for me
[09:38:50] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk you keep saying "phm" - not sure what that means.
[09:39:00] <teasercss> @Cork any idea why the window.open does not work I can confirm than query is loaded http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rgDbA
[09:39:04] <io_______> Cork: I htought I could just use a variable on the title item and get the variable from an external file
[09:39:26] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: did you search for phm in the code on the site I showed you?
[09:39:58] <duch_kazatel> that's inside the iframe.
[09:40:12] <unseensoul> Cork, lol. Sorted. Oh dear...
[09:40:27] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: yes how else would I change this?
[09:40:44] <duch_kazatel> if you're able to edit the iframe CSS through jquery (which is a "maybe" proposition), then you're golden, but I'll bet they don't want you to.
[09:40:59] <decx> i dont think it works
[09:41:14] <unseensoul> Cork, it's become a lot more clearer to understand it now :)
[09:41:22] <unseensoul> Thank you so much
[09:41:40] <Cork> io_______: ok, then you only have three options; 1. only send the data you need form the server; 2. filter it client side with regex or 3. parse it to dom pick put what elements you need and then serialize them back to html
[09:41:49] <Cork> io_______: there is no forth option
[09:42:06] <Cork> unseensoul: np :)
[09:42:18] <Cork> unseensoul: the submit default action for buttons is a bit messy
[09:42:25] <Cork> and easy to miss
[09:43:08] <ShawnRisk> decx duch_kazatel: what will work?
[09:43:41] <ShawnRisk> Why would I be able to change the height of the iframe but not the height of the activity stream?
[09:43:51] <duch_kazatel> because you can't edit the content of the iframe itself.
[09:44:08] <decx> ShawnRisk use the fb api to grab the posts of your public page instead of the likebox with activity stream
[09:44:41] <decx> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/
[09:44:51] <duch_kazatel> if you want fine-grained control, do what decx is suggesting - that's your only reliable option.
[09:46:47] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: thanks I will look into that
[09:46:56] <ShawnRisk> decx: thanks too, and I will look into that
[09:48:33] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk the idea behind the iframe is that it's fool proof.  in order for FB do to that with any reliability, they have to effectively lock it down.
[09:48:52] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: yet the API will let me unlock this?
[09:49:17] <duch_kazatel> the API will let you render content directly into your page, instead of putting it in an iframe.
[09:49:21] <duch_kazatel> do you know what iframes are?
[09:49:23] <io_______> ok I am trying this one:  https://github.com/ZeeAgency/jquery.htmlize
[09:49:41] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: yes
[09:50:54] <io_______> var data1 = $(data).find( "#one").htmlize();   data1 is empty ....
[09:51:28] <decx> ShawnRisk i forgot about it, but there's also a plugin to show posts from a facebook page, it's called "embedded posts"
[09:52:00] <decx> but i dont know if that only shows one post?
[09:52:27] <ShawnRisk> decx: want to show all of them as is shown
[09:52:55] <Cork> io_______: why are you over complicating it
[09:53:06] <Cork> io_______: i already gave you the code you needed before
[09:53:31] <Cork> io_______: $('<div>').html($(data).find( "#one")).html()
[09:53:45] <Cork> this will give you the serialized html for the #one element
[09:54:25] <io_______> Cork: I tried that before but i get an empty result
[09:54:48] <Cork> io_______: then you don't have any id="one" in the return data
[09:55:00] <Cork> or it might be the outer most element
[09:55:19] <Cork> io_______: btw do you want the one element or just the content of it?
[09:55:32] <Cork> (content is easier)
[09:55:54] <Cork> io_______: anyway you could try $(data).filter('#one').html()
[09:55:57] <io_______> Cork: either would do, and yes I have it as I can see data on an alert
[09:56:43] <ShawnRisk> decx: ideas?
[09:56:48] <io_______> Cork: that seems to ork
[09:57:21] <Cork> io_______: if it is the outer most element in a fragment you can't find for it
[09:57:34] <Cork> cause it isn't a child of any of the elements in the jquery element list
[09:57:38] <Cork> it is actually in the list
[09:57:47] <Cork> so you just filter out the element you want
[09:57:59] <Cork> that's why you need filter and not find
[09:58:35] <io_______> Excellent
[09:59:03] <io_______> i understand that the best way would be to dinamically create the array sent to supersized
[09:59:44] <io_______> Cork++
[10:00:02] <io_______> no karma bot here?
[10:00:09] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:04:58] <Cork> io_______: it would have been much faster to answer the question if you had shown the structure you got and what you needed out
[10:05:03] <Cork> but it got solved in the end
[10:07:35] <melling> hey, whats the best way to check if my elements exist before using them?
[10:07:36] <melling> i wanna do something like var el = $('.foo a'); if(el) { el.click(...); }
[10:07:50] <melling> would it be el.length > 0?
[10:07:57] <Cork> mellernoia: you don't need to
[10:08:10] <Cork> jquery handles that internally
[10:08:11] <decx> ShawnRisk sorry i don't have the strength of character to delve deeper into thhe facebook api unless i'm forced to
[10:08:35] <Cork> so all direct jquery commands are safe to use even if nothing is found
[10:09:01] <Cork> mellernoia: one situation you need to check is if you need to do something like offset().top
[10:09:16] <Cork> where offset() will return undefined if no element was found
[10:09:20] <ShawnRisk> decx: thanks
[10:09:36] <melling> Cork: ok, whats the best way to check in that situation? my example wasn't great tbh
[10:09:40] <decx> it's a big hassle, as you probably found out yourself ;)
[10:09:52] <melling> Cork: thanks btw :)
[10:10:15] <Cork> mellernoia: var el $('selector'); if(el.length > 0) { top = el.offset().top; }
[10:10:44] <Cork> mellernoia: but like i said, that is one of the very few situations where you actually need to check
[10:10:50] <melling> Cork: ah thanks, thats great - my example should have been calling .click(...) on something that wasn't el
[10:11:07] <melling> so checking for the existence of some items before adding the handler to an unrelated element
[10:11:15] <Cork> ah
[10:11:29] <duch_kazatel> you could also use event delegation and not worry about what elements exist when!
[10:11:32] <duch_kazatel> but i'm weird.
[10:11:42] <melling> also i should register mellernoia with nickserv now ;)
[10:11:46] <Cork> was just about to suggest that ya :)
[10:12:22] <Cork> if you dynamically add event listeners you have a high likelihood of doing something over complicated
[10:12:36] <melling> whoa duch, expand?
[10:12:46] <Cork> expand?
[10:12:59] <melling> Cork: it can't be half as complicated as what the developer before me did...
[10:13:07] <melling> i'm mostly untangling today
[10:13:16] <duch_kazatel> melling $('#parentThatExists').on('click', '.childSelector', function(){});
[10:13:38] <Cork> mellernoia: $(document).on('click', '.match +.target', function() {})
[10:13:39] <duch_kazatel> the "parentThatExists" is something that exists at time of binding, preferably on pageload.
[10:13:45] <Cork> or something like that
[10:13:55] <duch_kazatel> the .childSelector is whatever you want to match on.
[10:14:02] <Cork> as long as a selector can match both elements in the same selector you don't need the if code you talk about
[10:14:04] <duch_kazatel> it can be any jquery selector.
[10:14:07] <melling> that's awesome... every day is a schoolday!
[10:14:24] <Cork> and if you need the if selector it is most likely better to have it happen in the click handler
[10:14:30] <Cork> instead of removing and adding the handler
[10:14:47] <duch_kazatel> event delegation also has minor performance benefits since you're binding one event, not many.
[10:15:14] <Cork> duch_kazatel: it depends A LOT depending on the number of event handlers you have
[10:15:22] <Cork> delegation can have HUGE effects on a big site
[10:15:40] <Cork> i know i saw it when delegate landed back in 1.5
[10:15:45] <duch_kazatel> Cork sure it can, but if you exercize smart targeting strategies, it's definitely a bit saner.
[10:16:03] <duch_kazatel> that's why i avoid binding to $(document) as much as possible.
[10:16:14] <Cork> duch_kazatel: you miss my point
[10:16:24] <Cork> if you move from plain bind to delegated event listeners
[10:16:43] <Cork> you can speed up the page a lot depending on how the page is structured
[10:16:46] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah.
[10:16:49] <duch_kazatel> well aware.
[10:17:12] <Cork> especially if you move event listeners form ex every td in a table
[10:17:16] <Cork> to one of the table
[10:17:18] <Cork> for example
[10:17:22] <duch_kazatel> that's what i just said...
[10:18:01] <duch_kazatel> i poorly phrased "event delegation also has minor performance benefits since you're binding one event, not many." - I meant that you're binding a single event to a parent element and allowing bubbling to do it's thing.
[10:18:16] <duch_kazatel> instead of needing to bind multiple events unnecessarily.
[10:18:25] <Cork> duch_kazatel: my argue was about the "minor" part :)
[10:18:35] <Cork> cause it can be way WAY more then minor in some cases
[10:19:14] <duch_kazatel> eh, i think it can be fairly negligible and in some cases LESS performant if you're not careful.
[10:19:23] <duch_kazatel> but generally, yes, you will see performance increases.
[10:19:43] <duch_kazatel> github just released a monkey-patch that addresses a minor performance issue with the child selector matching.
[10:19:48] <duch_kazatel> speeds things up nicely.
[10:19:54] <Cork> duch_kazatel: i've had a widget almost double the speed from delegation alone
[10:20:11] <Cork> i wouldn't call that minor :)
[10:20:17] <duch_kazatel> yeah, in most cases you'll see a benefit.
[10:20:23] <Cork> but yes it was a grid, with very complex logic
[10:20:32] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[10:20:56] <InstaGrams5>  Anybody like to play poker online? TRying to get players to sign up.100% match Msg me
[10:20:57] <Cork> (content editable, dropdowns, pagination, selecton so on)
[10:21:17] <Cork> InstaGrams5: wrong channel
[10:21:27] <duch_kazatel> InstaGrams5 that's against freenode's TOS
[10:23:11] <Cork> interesting wasn't kicked
[10:23:40] <Cork> (or rather k-lined)
[10:25:38] <Mike11123> howdy jQuery, quick question (i hope), i have a click event that is being fired twice.  Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/nEwBaPPs
[10:27:31] <Cork> Mike11123: can you reproduce it in jsfiddle?
[10:28:01] <Cork> cause i can't see anything in the snippet that looks like it would cause the problem
[10:29:56] <madprops> hello, something very weird is going on
[10:30:10] <madprops> if i call a function from inside my code it doesn't work, but if i call it from the chrome console it does
[10:30:20] <madprops> i have the function mapped to the down arrow key
[10:30:21] <duch_kazatel> madprops a jsfiddle is important.
[10:30:26] <madprops> here's the function http://pastebin.com/fE4wWpH0
[10:30:57] <melling> madprops are you sure your arrow key mapping is calling the function?
[10:31:08] <melling> like have you tried a console.log or alert to verify it?
[10:31:16] <duch_kazatel> madprops where's the event binding.
[10:31:17] <madprops> it is, i can see it enters the function and actually works once, then it doesn't work
[10:31:25] <madprops> if i call it from the console it works everytime
[10:32:02] <madprops> here's the binding http://pastebin.com/nHGa73KK
[10:32:29] <madprops> i think it's grabbing the wrong selector
[10:32:40] <Cork> maddog__: sounds like you are calling the function before the page has loaded
[10:33:35] <Cork> madprops: also you are using a lot of global variables there
[10:33:41] <Cork> don't forget var
[10:39:53] <duch_kazatel> this dude is just all sorts of confused about browsers and how they work.
[10:39:55] <duch_kazatel> it's making me sad.
[10:40:07] <Cork> who?
[10:40:19] <duch_kazatel> the dude who said IE11 is based on Opera.
[10:40:30] <Cork> wasn't that just a joke?
[10:40:35] <duch_kazatel> no he was dead serious.
[10:40:39] <Cork> O_o
[10:40:45] <duch_kazatel> like, I turned around and kind of laughed and he looked at me funny.
[10:41:15] <duch_kazatel> i pointed out what i said earlier, etc.
[10:41:28] <duch_kazatel> and he looked at me like i was retarded and said "oh then it must've been an old version of opera"
[10:41:34] <duch_kazatel> i still have no idea wtf he was talking about.
[10:42:45] <Cork> duch_kazatel: you mean something like this guy? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuqemytQ5QA
[10:43:01] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaahahahaha
[10:43:04] <duch_kazatel> jesus
[10:43:35] <decx> that must be the most american guy every
[10:43:37] <decx> -<
[10:43:40] <decx> -y
[10:43:41] <Cork> i was totally dumb folded when i saw it first...
[10:43:53] <duch_kazatel> decx huh?
[10:44:18] <Cork> he's a canadian if my sources is correct
[10:44:27] <duch_kazatel> he's on a TV show in the US though.
[10:44:30] <decx> that's in america iirc :>
[10:44:36] <duch_kazatel> decx uh, no it's not.
[10:44:39] <Cork> heh
[10:44:43] <duch_kazatel> that's in North America, the continent.
[10:44:43] <decx> sure it is
[10:44:48] <duch_kazatel> but not america, the country.
[10:44:48] <decx> oh well ;)
[10:44:51] <Cork> computer says noooo... ;P
[10:45:10] <duch_kazatel> and kevin o'leary is a media personality who needs eyeballs for a television show.
[10:45:16] <duch_kazatel> "hey he said a thing whoooo"
[10:45:36] <decx> do canadians ship out their laissez fair evangelists down to the us?
[10:45:41] <jedimind> kevin o'leary is a capitalist pig canadian
[10:45:41] <decx> how was that other guy called
[10:45:46] <decx> ted cruz
[10:47:01] <duch_kazatel> decx sure, cruz is nuts.
[10:47:05] <duch_kazatel> there are lots of crazy peo[ple./
[10:47:25] <Cork> was the last part there a hint to a site? :D
[10:47:42] <duch_kazatel> hahaha nope.
[10:47:49] <BillCriswell> I keep trying to use my PowerBook as a touch screen.
[10:48:23] <BillCriswell> Er, Macbook Pro.
[10:48:38] <melling> hah, right device, wrong decade
[10:49:06] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I never owned a powerbook... No idea where that came from.
[10:49:14] <BillCriswell> I had an iBook.
[10:49:20] <BillCriswell> Wait... is that right?
[10:49:24] <BillCriswell> iBook G4?
[10:49:33] <melling> thats a powerbook i think
[10:49:40] <melling> i book was the colorful one
[10:49:50] <duch_kazatel> http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/190976535386?lpid=82
[10:49:52] <duch_kazatel> that's the ibook
[10:50:06] <BillCriswell> Yeah I had the g4. Loved that computer at the time.
[10:50:08] <duch_kazatel> man i remember when the g3 and g4 came out.
[10:50:17] <duch_kazatel> we had a power mac g4.
[10:50:32] <BillCriswell> That case was awesome.
[10:50:45] <duch_kazatel> i still liked the cheesegrater case more.
[10:50:51] <melling> last mac i owned was a performa 5200... never had any of the new stuff
[10:51:02] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[10:51:16] <duch_kazatel> oh man the putty mac eras.
[10:51:27] <BillCriswell> I had a Macbook Air at my last job. I miss it. =(
[10:51:34] <melling> well, new to me... i'm waiting for someone to come out and say "well I had an Apple ][ so suck it up"
[10:51:43] <duch_kazatel> i had a mac classic II.
[10:51:51] <jedimind> i have too many apple products
[10:52:06] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Same.
[10:52:15] <duch_kazatel> with twice the default ram.
[10:52:19] <jedimind> i have a mbp retina 13", a mb air, a mbp 13", 27" imac, ipad 3, ipad 2, ipad mini, and probably 4-5 different iphone variations
[10:52:39] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Damn.
[10:52:54] <duch_kazatel> so many devices, and yet... not a single REAL computer.
[10:52:57] <duch_kazatel> eyooooo
[10:52:57] <BillCriswell> I got rid of my iPad Mini. It was so useless to me.
[10:53:00] <duch_kazatel> SHOTS FIRED.
[10:53:05] <duch_kazatel> (i'm kidding)
[10:53:07] <jedimind> duch_kazatel :) i have a ton of other hardware too
[10:53:22] <jedimind> http://cl.ly/image/0H2W1V0J341j
[10:53:25] <jedimind> what my desk looks like
[10:53:56] <jedimind> my primary phones are windows + android
[10:53:58] <jedimind> i dont use iphones
[10:54:27] <BillCriswell> Multi device testing is so unfun.
[10:55:05] <duch_kazatel> right?
[10:55:10] <duch_kazatel> so glad i'm not on our mobile team.
[10:55:52] <BillCriswell> jedimind: What text editor is that? None of the apps in your dock are jumping out at me.
[10:56:17] <BillCriswell> Looks like sublime text?
[10:56:55] <Zzaichik> I'm guessing brackets
[10:58:16] <BillCriswell> I have that installed... not sure I ever opened it though haha.
[10:58:31] <jedimind> its brackets yeah
[10:58:42] <jedimind> well its "adobe edge code"
[10:58:45] <jedimind> which is a brackets build
[10:58:54] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Ah.
[10:58:58] <jedimind> i love my multi device testing
[10:59:21] <jedimind> i have it integrated into a live server, so everything is linked to my computer; if i make a change or adjust something, or toggle an interaction;
[10:59:22] <BillCriswell> IT looks like a nice setup, but it's still stressful testing all those devices
[10:59:26] <jedimind> all the devices at once get updated
[10:59:30] <jedimind> i dont have to do anything
[10:59:33] <jedimind> grunt ftw
[10:59:53] <Zzaichik> grunt is awesome.
[10:59:53] <BillCriswell> jedimind: I have mixture handle that for me.
[11:00:13] <jedimind> i used to have a group of interns
[11:00:19] <jedimind> sitting there pressing refresh when i yell at them
[11:00:25] <jedimind> or occasionaly throw half-empty soda cans at them
[11:00:26] <Zzaichik> there's a new one - Gulp it looks pretty decent
[11:00:36] <jedimind> but this is much cleaner solution
[11:00:42] <jedimind> much less crying too
[11:01:03] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Haha.
[11:01:27] <BillCriswell> I never knew you could add spaces to the dock, pretty awesome.
[11:01:55] <BillCriswell> defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}' <-- I would have never even come close to figuring that out.
[11:02:09] <jedimind> haha yeah i do that basically the moment i do a clean osx install
[11:02:49] <jedimind> hey if you guys have a moment or care to: http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-award/project/nymi/
[11:02:55] <jedimind> thats my brothers product
[11:03:02] <jedimind> a vote is appreciated if its something you guys can get behind
[11:03:31] <Mike11123> hmm.... for some reason my script is being called two times in a row from a single click?
[11:03:53] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Was something like this on sharktank before?
[11:04:04] <jedimind> not sure, i know this one specifically wasnt
[11:04:06] <jedimind> they had no need
[11:04:13] <jedimind> first round funding got them $4mil and they had to cut it off
[11:04:17] <jedimind> 2nd round got them 11mil
[11:04:20] <jedimind> in less than 3 days
[11:04:23] <jedimind> so they're doing okay for funding :)
[11:04:40] <BillCriswell> Did you do the site? Looks awesome.
[11:05:01] <jedimind> BillCriswell i overlooked it but they hired someone else to do it that had more bandwidth than me
[11:05:15] <jedimind> im not directly related to nymi, just providing brotherly support :)
[11:05:30] <jedimind> my brother was the 4th member, first hire of the company
[11:05:32] <jedimind> after the 3 founders
[11:05:33] <BillCriswell> Yeah. The site is awesome. Product seems great too.
[11:05:50] <jedimind> yeah its pretty cool, im trying to work out a scenario where i can work on the google password api
[11:05:51] <jedimind> for chrome
[11:05:54] <jedimind> and tie it into the nymi
[11:06:05] <jedimind> so that you never have to entere a password in chrome as long as you're wearing the bracelet
[11:06:22] <BillCriswell> I dream of a world with little to no passwords.
[11:06:41] <BillCriswell> Also, fonts looking the same across every os / browser / app
[11:07:11] <areckx> anyone here use foundation?
[11:07:26] <jedimind> lol yeah BillCriswell
[11:07:31] <jedimind> areckx i have, minimally, in the past
[11:07:46] <areckx> jedimind:  I am having trouble loading the orbit slider :: http://pastebin.com/hChpr3Bs
[11:07:58] <jedimind> oh i wouldnt know anything about that
[11:08:02] <jedimind> but maybe setup a testcase?
[11:08:03] <areckx> it just loads three dots and they don't move or show any of the placeholdit
[11:08:28] <areckx> I'm following the docs
[11:08:39] <areckx> http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/orbit.html
[11:09:39] <BillCriswell> areckx: Any erros in the consol?
[11:10:33] <areckx> jedimind: Failed to load resource
[11:10:45] <BillCriswell> areckx: I think we're on to something...
[11:11:08] <areckx> I have the correct path in the js files, the docs says something contrary to what their zip file contains
[11:11:24] <areckx> which is js/foundation/foundation.orbit.js
[11:11:36] <areckx> and js/vendor/jquery.js
[11:12:18] <areckx> it says to include them before the closing body tag, which I did; I also tried including them in the head and at the top of the body
[11:12:39] <BillCriswell> areckx: Something is just 404ing.
[11:13:31] <areckx> oh
[11:13:39] <areckx> I have a src="/vendor"
[11:14:24] <areckx> now I have nothihng in the console
[11:14:32] <BillCriswell> Is it working?
[11:14:51] <areckx> nope
[11:15:16] <BillCriswell> Do you have it live somewhere?
[11:15:54] <areckx> nope
[11:19:14] <DarkGhost> when you click learn more and that thing pops up
[11:19:19] <DarkGhost> why is there that extra height?http://devcollective.net/obie/#
[11:20:26] <BillCriswell> areckx: http://jsbin.com/usINUP/1/edit?html,css,js,output just tried following the docs and it seems to work.
[11:20:35] <Preda-> Join #css
[11:20:46] <Preda-> sorry :)
[11:20:55] <DarkGhost> me?
[11:20:57] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost huh?
[11:20:58] <Cork> DarkGhost: extra height?
[11:21:05] <DarkGhost> when that thing slides down
[11:21:09] <DarkGhost> its jumpy
[11:21:18] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost because the scrollbar appears on the right.
[11:21:27] <Cork> looks like its padding or margin that's collapsing
[11:21:27] <DarkGhost> hmm?
[11:21:43] <DarkGhost> where frm Cork
[11:21:57] <areckx> BillCriswell:  where do I put the $document.foundation?
[11:22:06] <Cork> if you mean the icons on the right
[11:22:38] <Cork> there margin top is collapsing
[11:22:50] <Cork> i don't see any other extra space at all in the animation
[11:23:06] <BillCriswell> areckx: I put it before the closing body tag usually, but you could put it whatever if you wait till the document is ready.
[11:23:58] <Cork> areckx: but ya you might want to put overflow-y: scroll on the page
[11:24:13] <DarkGhost> no like the first time you open that gray thing, theres like 100px extra height Cork
[11:24:17] <DarkGhost> only the first time
[11:24:18] <areckx> Cork:  right, but first I need to get the JS to work
[11:24:23] <Cork> opps wrong nick >_<
[11:24:27] <Cork> areckx: sorry
[11:25:19] <Cork> DarkGhost: ah
[11:25:51] <areckx> BillCriswell:  you're using different JS files, I'll try downloading those instead of using the included ones
[11:26:38] <BillCriswell> areckx: Just make sure you're loading things in the right order.
[11:26:45] <Cork> DarkGhost: are you using slideDown to animate?
[11:26:53] <DarkGhost> slideToggle
[11:26:55] <DarkGhost> Cork
[11:26:57] * Cork nods
[11:27:02] <DarkGhost> what about it
[11:27:15] <Cork> so remove the display: none
[11:27:22] <Cork> and use hide() on ready
[11:27:26] <DarkGhost> ok
[11:27:28] <synth_> http://pastebin.com/n7w01sXy anyone have any idea why this isn't working for me?
[11:27:34] <Cork> that usually fixes a lot of bugs with jquery animations
[11:27:52] <Mike11123> how would i go about having a list of links that can all run the same ajax function with different data?  This is a selection that will delete a record from a database.
[11:27:57] <DarkGhost> nope didnt
[11:28:11] <BillCriswell> synth_: Are you including jquery?
[11:28:23] <duch_kazatel> Mike11123 by using .on() and calling a function
[11:28:28] <DarkGhost> refresh Cork still does it
[11:28:29] <synth_> BillCriswell: yes.
[11:28:43] <synth_> BillCriswell: jquery is included via RequireJS
[11:28:46] <BillCriswell> synth_: Where is the script running? in <head>? before </body>?
[11:29:02] <synth_> it's technically running from <head>
[11:29:39] <BillCriswell> synth_: I'm not super familiar with require, but do you have the code in the callback for when jQuery is ready?
[11:30:40] <synth_> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/Yz1MMxax this is my page's "module". page.init() is run from <head></head>
[11:30:54] <areckx> BillCriswell:  got it now
[11:31:12] <synth_> BillCriswell: I know init is ran because console.log("contacts init...") logs to my console
[11:31:19] <Cork> DarkGhost: hmm
[11:31:22] <DarkGhost> Cork I got it
[11:31:25] <DarkGhost> by setting .textarea height
[11:31:26] <Cork> DarkGhost: what changes the height of it?
[11:31:41] <Cork> cause if you remove the display: none; you get the same effect
[11:31:48] <BillCriswell> synth_: Is this running on a full HTML page or just a partial HTML page?
[11:31:55] <DarkGhost> Cork refresh and tell me if it still jups
[11:32:36] <Cork> DarkGhost: the logo and social icons still jump
[11:32:45] <Cork> but ya the rest is stable
[11:32:51] <DarkGhost> ahh yeah I didn't even notice those
[11:32:51] <DarkGhost> hmm
[11:32:54] <DarkGhost> not too big of a deal but any idea why
[11:33:05] <Cork> those where the one i talked about before
[11:33:12] <Cork> looks like margin collapse
[11:33:22] <DarkGhost> ehh not too big of a deal
[11:33:26] <DarkGhost> but i think its cuz im removing that midbar
[11:33:28] <BillCriswell> synth_: http://jsbin.com/iJesuZuW/1/edit?html,js,output here is your code working
[11:33:58] <synth_> BillCriswell full HTML page, it's ran from <head></head> but the rest of the page is constructed depending on url variables. the anchor that has the "hide_user" class is constructed after .init() runs though, which is why i use $(document).on() and use the class as the selector
[11:34:52] <BillCriswell> synth_: What if you do $(document).ready(function(){ /* Your code */ });?
[11:36:02] <Cork> DarkGhost: no
[11:36:20] <synth_> BillCriswell, that shouldn't be necessary, this is all ran within the .ready() function technically. Here's an example of another page I have that does work and all anchors are being procedurally generated via php: http://pastebin.com/Ffa2UwFs
[11:38:00] <Cork> DarkGhost: ah, sorry
[11:38:01] <Cork> yes it is
[11:38:11] <Cork> DarkGhost: try what happens if you don't fade it
[11:38:18] <Cork> and just do .hide() on it instead
[11:38:33] <BillCriswell> synth_: I don't know then. Never used require js.
[11:38:37] <Cork> i think that should look good
[11:39:08] <Cork> DarkGhost: right now it gets pushed down by the animating bar instead
[11:39:16] <DarkGhost> Cork so how could I do it with the fade.
[11:39:19] <Cork> DarkGhost: alternatively you could position it absolute
[11:39:23] <DarkGhost> position whaT?
[11:39:24] <DarkGhost> the baR?
[11:39:50] <Cork> DarkGhost: i think the fade on the slide down just looks a little weird
[11:39:55] <Cork> DarkGhost: yes
[11:40:05] <DarkGhost> what do you think it should do
[11:40:05] <DarkGhost> also slide
[11:40:09] <DarkGhost> i don't think just a hide
[11:40:11] <DarkGhost> would be good
[11:40:28] <BillCriswell> synth_: Your jQuery is fine, something else is fucky.
[11:40:29] <Cork> DarkGhost: no just a simple .hide() when the animation starts
[11:40:39] <DarkGhost> ehh i dont think itd look good
[11:40:55] <Cork> DarkGhost: have the other bar start its animation at the same height as the middle bar has
[11:41:01] <synth_> BillCriswell yeah... I'm not sure what's wrong. I'll debug it further. thanks for your assistance though
[11:41:05] <DarkGhost> Cork how do i go about that
[11:41:07] <Cork> so it just replaces it
[11:41:09] <BillCriswell> No prob bob.
[11:41:34] <Cork> height(middlebar.height()).slideDown('slow')
[11:41:55] <DarkGhost> im confused height(middlebar.height()).slideDown('slow') ?!~
[11:41:56] <Cork> DarkGhost: and in slideUp you show the other bar and hide the top
[11:42:08] <duch_kazatel> anybody know off the top of their head if the jqueryui accordion widget has a callback that fires after initialization?
[11:42:09] <DarkGhost> idk what you mean im confused lol
[11:43:59] <Cork> DarkGhost: $(topbar).height($(middlebar).height()).show()0.animate({ height: '583px' }, 'slow');$(middlebar).hide()
[11:44:06] <Cork> opps extra 0 in there...
[11:44:28] <DarkGhost> ok add that when you click the learn more
[11:44:56] <Cork> DarkGhost: alternatively make the middle bar position absolute so it isn't included in what is slid down
[11:45:08] <Cork> and just fade it from where it is
[11:45:18] <Cork> either would work
[11:45:39] <Cork> but right now it slides down and fade at the same time and it just looks weird
[11:46:51] <Cork> DarkGhost: i would prob go with making the middle menu position absolute and have it hide the other bar under it
[11:47:16] <Cork> DarkGhost: and on click just hide() it and have the other bar look like it expands from it
[11:48:05] <DarkGhost> ok Cork
[11:48:10] <DarkGhost> ill try
[11:49:12] <synth_> BillCriswell interesting, I switched my call to: $(document).on("click", "a", function(event){ and got it to log just fine. Here's the output: This element: contacts.js:13; [a.hide_user, context: a.hide_user, jquery: "2.0.3", constructor: function, init: function, selector: ""â€¦]
[11:50:24] <DarkGhost> http://devcollective.net/obie/# like this Cork? Idk... I don't know how to make it slide out of other bar
[11:51:08] <BillCriswell> What are you trying to log?
[11:51:55] <synth_> BillCriswell i logged the object itself: $(document).on("click", "a", function(event){console.log("This element:"); console.log($(this)); event.preventDefault();});
[11:52:51] <Cork> DarkGhost: ok 1. #midbar needs to go outside the #landing_bg
[11:53:21] <DarkGhost> ugh
[11:53:25] <DarkGhost> lol
[11:54:14] <synth_> BillCriswell i was even able to log $(this).attr("class") which returned "hide_user", however, $(document).on("click", ".hide_user", function(event){ ... still didn't work
[11:54:23] <synth_> sigh.
[11:55:07] <synth_> ....... BillCriswell now it works. what the heck.
[11:56:38] <synth_> BillCriswell I literally changed my jQuery code from: http://pastebin.com/n7w01sXy to: http://pastebin.com/rzx5G8r7 and it worked. lol.
[11:56:50] <synth_> didn't touch the html/php at all either.
[11:56:55] <synth_> weird.
[11:59:09] <Cork> DarkGhost: opps missed to post 2. .textarea needs to have paddin-top: 0; (no display none) and then do .animate({ paddingTop: 20, height: 536 }, 'slow')
[11:59:30] <Cork> DarkGhost: 3. #midbar { z-index: 5; }
[11:59:39] <Cork> DarkGhost: something like that should do it
[11:59:42] <DarkGhost> hmm
[11:59:47] <DarkGhost> okay, one question before i do this
[12:00:04] <DarkGhost> I know this is more on css side. but when I goto mobile device there is a huge white space.. like 30px (before opening extra part)
[12:00:07] <DarkGhost> any idea why
[12:00:53] <Cork> DarkGhost: hmm just guessing a bit, but it might be from the margin fiddling you have in the top bar
[12:01:29] <Cork> css2 rules is sadly still a bit broken in most mobile browsers
[12:01:48] <Cork> (very broken in some of them)
[12:02:33] <Cork> DarkGhost: another solution could actually be to just move the midbar into the top section :)
[12:02:53] <DarkGhost> your saying you think it could be the .textarea margin ?
[12:02:55] <DarkGhost> or what is the "top ba"R
[12:03:15] <Cork> the bar that slides down
[12:03:35] <Cork> but it is really hard to say without breaking down the problem
[12:03:45] <DarkGhost> hmm
[12:03:45] <DarkGhost> ugh
[12:03:46] <DarkGhost> w.e
[12:03:48] <DarkGhost> sucks but
[12:03:52] <Cork> (mobile development usually give me nightmares)
[12:03:56] <Cork> j/k :)
[12:04:24] <Cork> chrome and fennec is ok but most of the others suck hard
[12:05:21] <Cork> man i wish they didn't rebrand fennec to mobile firefox
[12:06:05] <Cork> http://www.geemick.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mozilla-fennec.jpg
[12:06:11] <Cork> i liked the logo :)
[12:06:55] <decx> "logo"
[12:16:47] <gry> shoky, did you get it running? [[Special:MyPage/common.js]]
[12:35:57] <shoky> gry: nope, i still dont know what that's all about
[12:49:55] <shoky> gry: ok got it running
[12:50:21] <shoky> gry: understandJson is returning false, and the deferred is rejected. seems fine to me
[12:57:49] <erebel55> why does my arrow div jump at first instead of sliding with the purple div?
[12:57:51] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/erebel55/S5PaD/
[13:00:59] <Cork> erebel55: did you see my comment before about why the animation didn't happen?
[13:02:37] <erebel55> Cork: searching back up, sorry
[13:02:58] <Cork> erebel55: and i'm guessing it is the same reason you get the problem your seeing here
[13:04:11] <Cork> erebel55: so what happens is that every thing is wrapped in an ui-effect-wrapper element
[13:04:29] <Cork> and it causes the distortion of your elements
[13:05:03] <Cork> erebel55: this is the first time i've looked closer at the ui effect work (didn't really like it before so never cared)
[13:05:11] <Cork> and i can't say i like what i see...
[13:05:51] <erebel55> Cork: yea, that is a bit annoying
[13:06:13] <Cork> erebel55: i get itchy on my back just seeing the code modifying the dom...
[13:06:18] <Cork> >_<
[13:07:26] <gry> shoky: ah i see
[13:07:30] <Agamemnus> http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/#type-checks
[13:07:44] <Agamemnus> News flash.. typeof always returns string.. so why === ?
[13:08:12] <gry> shoky: how do i console.log() an object contents instead of the â€œ[object Object]â€ string?
[13:08:18] <NaN> I'm doing this ajax post but the server doesn't get the data as json >> http://pastie.org/private/aticqyiqoyxc1iyycnfpia << what am I doing wrong?
[13:13:15] <Cork> Agamemnus: some developers don't like to have the type conversion
[13:13:28] <Cork> and it doesn't really matter what you use as it is the same type
[13:14:04] <Agamemnus> But that's the style guide. I just don't see the point of adding extra characters
[13:14:39] <Cork> Agamemnus: it is normally considered good to not use type conversion if you don't know you need it
[13:14:56] <Cork> there is arguments both way though
[13:14:57] <Agamemnus> too many negatives
[13:15:02] <Agamemnus> brain 'splodes
[13:15:32] <Cork> Agamemnus: there is a few pitfalls where == can match for thins you don't expect
[13:15:38] <Cork> not explicitly for typeof
[13:15:58] <Cork> but it is often considered better to always use === unless you know you need ==
[13:16:01] <Agamemnus> yeah ok, i am just talking about typeof
[13:16:17] <Agamemnus> I think of it as the opposite.
[13:16:23] <Agamemnus> I use == unless I know I need ===
[13:16:39] <Cork> Agamemnus: like i said there are arguments in both directions
[13:17:26] <Cork> about the extra character, the cost is close to none existent
[13:19:43] <erebel55> Cork: I'm still not sure I understand what jquery ui is doing.
[13:20:16] <Cork> erebel55: when it is about to start the animation
[13:20:52] <Cork> it does $(targets).wrapAll('<div class="ui-effect-wrapper">')
[13:21:00] <Cork> and then it animates on the wrapper
[13:21:02] <rightnow|home> var data; $table.find('> thead > tr > th').each(function() { data = $(this).html(); }  console.log(data); turns out empty? anyone know what im doing wrong?
[13:21:14] <Cork> and when the animation is done it unwraps the content
[13:21:52] <Cork> rightnow|home: console.log($table.find('> thead > tr > th').length)
[13:22:23] <rightnow|home> Cork, adding console.log($(this).html()) prints out the data. i just cannot save it to the parent variable.
[13:22:28] <shoky> gry: in normal browsers console.log should show you the object which you can expand by clicking on it
[13:22:35] <shoky> gry: otherwise try console.dir()
[13:22:43] <Cork> rightnow|home: no i meant run that code at the place where you run the each loop
[13:22:52] <Cork> rightnow|home: i suspect you will get 0 in the console log
[13:23:07] <gry> shoky, thanks, that's true; the browser appears to behave 'normally'..
[13:23:11] <rightnow|home> Cork, no i get 12, and console.log($(this).html()) inside the .each works
[13:23:19] <jeemeer> Hi guys - got a quicky if someone could look for me. http://paulietheboss.com/babou/ - If you shrink the browser window down the nav disappears and a slicknav version appears up at the top instead - it works fine in ie/ff/chrome but isn't working on ipad or my phone (s3) - any ideas?
[13:23:27] <shoky> gry: whatcha mean?
[13:24:15] <rightnow|home> Cork, works now, my bad
[13:24:23] <IamTrying> How can i let this draggable to be visible in the parent window not corssing the view port. $( "#StayInTheWindowOnly" ).draggable();
[13:24:28] <Cork> rightnow|home: sidenote i would go with: var data = $.map($table.find('> thead > tr > th'), function(elm) { return $elm).html(); });
[13:24:46] <Cork> rightnow|home: * var data = $.map($table.find('> thead > tr > th'), function(elm) { return $(elm).html(); });
[13:25:34] <rightnow|home> Cork, is that faster aswell?
[13:25:55] <Cork> rightnow|home: it is a bit slower, but the code is much cleaner
[13:25:58] <rightnow|home> ok
[13:26:07] <rightnow|home> Cork, what if i would like the .html() to go inside an array?
[13:26:17] <Cork> rightnow|home: map does th
[13:26:20] <Cork> *that
[13:26:21] <rightnow|home> ok!
[13:26:42] <IamTrying> .draggable({ containment: 'parent' });  Similar but on the screen how?
[13:27:05] <rightnow|home> Cork, thank you!
[13:27:10] <Cork> yw
[13:27:14] <ShawnRisk> how come the addClass, removeClass and switchClass are not doing anything in this code: http://pastebin.com/3S1Hy2yH ?
[13:27:36] <Cork> switchClass??
[13:27:39] <Cork> ?api switchClass
[13:27:40] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[13:27:47] <shoky> IamTrying: containment: 'window'  ?
[13:28:16] <Cork> rightnow|home: plugin?
[13:28:23] <ShawnRisk> switchClass?
[13:28:34] <Cork> ya
[13:28:54] <ShawnRisk> Cork:  What am I doing wrong?
[13:29:13] <Cork> ShawnRisk: i suspect the code crashes on switchClass cause it doesn't exist
[13:29:24] <shoky> not that it makes much sense otherwise
[13:29:39] <rightnow|home> Cork, sorry?
[13:29:43] <IamTrying> WoW YES you got it shoky thank you exactly.
[13:29:54] <Cork> rightnow|home: sorry wrong nick
[13:29:56] <jeemeer> Could anyone have a quick look for me please? http://paulietheboss.com/babou/ - If you shrink the browser window down the main nav disappears and a jQuery slicknav version appears up at the top instead - it works fine in ie/ff/chrome but isn't working on ipad or my phone (s3) - any ideas?
[13:29:56] <erebel55> Cork: so, it brings my arrowTab div over to where the purple div is and then starts the slide for it?
[13:30:12] <rightnow|home> Cork :D ok
[13:30:47] <ShawnRisk> ?api switchClass
[13:30:47] <b-ot> ShawnRisk: No matches.
[13:31:25] <ShawnRisk> Cork: the docs are there: http://api.jqueryui.com/switchclass/
[13:32:21] <Cork> erebel55: well no but it does some margin magic on the wrapper element + text-indent
[13:32:43] <Cork> erebel55: but and i suspect it is the text-indent that breaks your design
[13:32:51] <Cork> ah
[13:33:03] <Cork> ShawnRisk: so yes; a plugin
[13:33:29] <Cork> ok
[13:33:48] <ShawnRisk> I already added jquery ui to my site
[13:33:53] <mariuscc> any clue what was used here, at the bottom, on the social icons ? http://143.95.95.148/demo/?theme=travel jquery css ?
[13:33:59] <mariuscc> the animation I mean
[13:34:00] <Cork> ShawnRisk: you most likely need to use the complete callback on the switchClass call
[13:34:23] <Cork> ShawnRisk: the problem your seeing is that you say animate from class a to b
[13:34:42] <Cork> and then before the animation has done anything removes the ending class
[13:35:07] <Cork> just a guess though, as i haven't used switchClass
[13:35:09] <erebel55> Cork: okay, thanks; I guess I should probably stop using jquery ui for this animation then
[13:35:46] <Cork> erebel55: well either that or you need to wrap your code in something that protects it from it
[13:35:55] <Cork> s/code/html/
[13:35:59] <ShawnRisk> Cork: as I said Add and Remove Class doesn't work either
[13:37:06] <Cork> ShawnRisk: and logo.length > 0 ?
[13:37:20] <shoky> mariuscc: http://143.95.95.148/demo/travel/blue/assets/js/js-index.js   look for  SCROLL ANIMATIONS
[13:38:05] <mariuscc> shoky: got them, Thanks Alot!
[13:38:20] <newbsduser> hello, if($("input[name='radio-choice-1']:checked").val()==result.cevap_id) {
[13:38:31] <newbsduser> it s working correctly.. two values equals 1
[13:38:44] <newbsduser> how can i solve it
[13:38:52] <erebel55> Cork: so I need a wrapper div? I'm not sure what else beyond that..and I haven't been successful googling for others with this problem
[13:39:00] <shoky> mariuscc: though i wouldn't recommend learning from that code, it's pretty bad
[13:39:11] <Cork> erebel55: i can't answer that
[13:39:42] <Cork> i would have to fiddle a lot with the ui animation to find a way to prevent it from breaking things
[13:39:45] <madalin> i have a small jquery issue. Can someone take a look at a function i made and tell me what i'm doing wrong ? -- http://pastebin.com/PKZm4nPv
[13:39:52] <Cork> and i'm not even sure the animation would work after that
[13:39:59] <mariuscc> shoky: not learning just stealing :), I'll customize it for my needs
[13:40:42] <Cork> newbsduser: you can't really difference them if all you have to separate them is the value
[13:41:05] <newbsduser> Cork what is the solution
[13:41:16] <Cork> use separate values?
[13:41:20] <Cork> or different names
[13:41:23] <BillCriswell> madalin: What is .selectBox doing?
[13:41:23] <newbsduser> how?
[13:41:29] <newbsduser> can i seperate value
[13:41:30] <ShawnRisk> Cork: logo.length = 0
[13:41:31] <Cork> editing the hmtl?
[13:41:36] <Cork> *html
[13:41:48] <newbsduser> but when alert them
[13:41:51] <newbsduser> i see only 1 value?
[13:41:56] <madalin> BillCriswell: that's plugin replacing the selectbox functions. The problem is the hasError value gets set and i can't get past the step1..
[13:42:13] <Cork> newbsduser: ya, wasn't that the problem?
[13:42:30] <Cork> newbsduser: you have two checkboxes with the same name and value+
[13:42:34] <Cork> *?
[13:42:49] <newbsduser> no
[13:42:51] <newbsduser> i dont have
[13:42:57] <madalin> BillCriswell: i'm trying to .addClass step-error only where there's an error. I think the problem lies in here: var $link = jQuery('.step-form-nav ul li:nth-child(' + parseInt(step) + ')'); but i'm not really sure..
[13:42:59] <newbsduser> each radiobutton has different value
[13:43:05] <newbsduser> i read them from json data
[13:43:12] <Cork> newbsduser: ah
[13:43:53] <BillCriswell> madalin: No reason to use parseInt there. It would be easier to read as jQuery('.step-form-nav ul li').eq(step);
[13:43:55] <ShawnRisk> Cork: What does length have to do with this?
[13:44:10] <madalin> BillCriswell: but will that actually WORK ?
[13:44:30] <Cork> ShawnRisk: if logo.length is 0 it means the selector up at the top didn't find the logo element
[13:44:53] <jeemeer> Could someone maybe have look for me please? - http://paulietheboss.com/babou/ - If you shrink the browser window a jQuery slicknav version activates instead of the main nav... it works fine in ie/ff/chrome and on galaxy s3 chrome, but not on ipad portrait mode - any ideas?
[13:46:10] <Cork> newbsduser: http://jsfiddle.net/ex5r2/
[13:46:15] <Cork> the code looks like it should work
[13:46:39] <Cork> newbsduser: so more info is needed
[13:46:42] <madalin> BillCriswell: actually, it doesnt..
[13:47:07] <BillCriswell> It doesn't work?
[13:47:11] <thinkxl> what is equal to var-- and ++othervar ?
[13:47:17] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I am not sure what to do, I am copying some of the items here: http://jsfiddle.net/aMXRq/29/
[13:47:20] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:47:34] <BillCriswell> thinkxl: Hm?
[13:47:43] <madalin> BillCriswell: the .eq(step) works, but its not fixing my initial problem lol :)
[13:47:46] <Cork> thinkxl: var = var - 1; and othervar = othervar +1;
[13:47:51] <erebel55> jeemeer: works on iphone in portrait and landscape. sorry i don't have an ipad
[13:47:51] <BillCriswell> var -= 1 and othervar += 1 ?
[13:47:59] <thinkxl> trying to undersetand this: https://gist.github.com/natos/2001487
[13:48:06] <jeemeer> ok thankyou erebel55 i really appreciate that <3
[13:48:16] <Cork> thinkxl: the first one changes the value after it has returned it to the left, and the second changes it before it is returned
[13:48:19] <Peter222> <input type="checkbox" name='employer[22]' value="345" /> <-- how to get key value 22?
[13:48:26] <jeemeer> erebel55 - what iphone if i may ask? for reference :)
[13:48:33] <thinkxl> Cork: that is what I need to know, thanks!
[13:48:37] <erebel55> jeemeer: iphone 4
[13:48:40] <jeemeer> ty
[13:48:40] <erebel55> lol i'm behind
[13:48:44] <BillCriswell> Peter222: Ehh, a regex could work I guess.
[13:49:07] <madalin> Peter222: i think it would be easier to add an ID to it and use something like jQuery("#id_here").val();
[13:49:25] <BillCriswell> Peter222: Might be easier to do like data-key="22" in the HTML and call $(this).data('key')
[13:49:59] <Peter222> thank You all!
[13:50:17] <Cork> Peter222: $(elm).attr('name').match(/\[(.*)\]/)[1]
[13:50:20] <Cork> is another option
[13:50:45] <madalin> BillCriswell: what i'm trying to achieve is add .step-error the the corresponding LI for each step..
[13:50:59] <BillCriswell> 'employer[22]'.split('[')[1].slice(0, -1) as well.
[13:51:12] <BillCriswell> I love slice.
[13:51:18] <Peter222> Cork: perfect! thanks!
[13:51:20] <duch_kazatel> slice is cool.
[13:51:32] <BillCriswell> array or string, slice don't care.
[13:52:20] <madalin> Maybe someone else can help with http://pastebin.com/PKZm4nPv --- and why it doesn't apply the .step-error to the SPECIFIC step ?:(
[13:53:23] <duch_kazatel> madalin do you have a working jsfiddle?
[13:53:44] <madalin> duch_kazatel: nope :(
[13:53:56] <duch_kazatel> what is your code trying to do?
[13:54:18] <BlakeH> Guys, i know this syntax is wrong but i need to look for multiple classes like this: var $rows = $("#" + rowId + " > .span5, > .width48, > .width47");
[13:54:49] <BlakeH> I really want to do this: var $rows = $("#" + rowId + " > .span5 .width48  .width47");
[13:54:50] <madalin> duch_kazatel: add .step-error to every step where there's an error.. but it currently adds an error to all the steps even if step1 is clear (eroarep1 = '0') :(
[13:55:09] <Cork> BlakeH: $("#" + rowId).children(".span5, .width48, .width47");
[13:55:28] <BlakeH> thanks!
[13:56:05] <ShawnRisk> Cork: Any ideas to fix this?
[13:56:29] <Cork> ShawnRisk: never got a response on what the length said
[13:57:06] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I said that and you answered back, if you asked another question let me know.
[13:57:28] <Cork> ShawnRisk: no you asked what i meant, not what it was
[13:57:33] <zumba_addict> is it possible to clear the contents of <fieldset><p>blah</p></fieldset>? I want it to become  <fieldset></fieldset>
[13:57:46] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I said this equals 0
[13:57:50] <Cork> ShawnRisk: ok
[13:58:00] <Cork> ShawnRisk: where is this code running?
[13:58:06] <Cork> in head?
[13:59:45] <ShawnRisk> Cork: in sub folder js in file called fadelogo.js and this is in head
[14:00:01] <Cork> ShawnRisk: is the code wrapped in .ready?
[14:00:11] <madalin> Can someone take a look at http://pastebin.com/PKZm4nPv --- and tell my its not applying the .step-error to EACH step where it's supposed to ?
[14:00:16] <ShawnRisk> Cork: code is in pastebin, I showed you
[14:00:29] <Cork> and that is all of it?
[14:00:37] <Cork> ?api ready
[14:00:37] <b-ot> Cork: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[14:00:41] <Cork> if yes ^
[14:01:50] <ShawnRisk> Cork: yes why is there something wrong?  Should I not have .ready?
[14:02:36] <Cork> ShawnRisk: ok, can you show the html page?
[14:02:43] <Cork> this is getting silly
[14:03:53] <BillCriswell> madalin: I'm having a hard time following your logic to be honest. You should set it up at like jsbin.com so we can get a good idea for what you're trying to do.
[14:04:16] <ShawnRisk> Cork: it is locally been done so far.
[14:05:10] <ShawnRisk> Cork: can I pm you?
[14:05:44] <Cork> ShawnRisk: i usually don't like pm, and it's getting late
[14:05:52] <ShawnRisk> okay
[14:05:55] <madalin> BillCriswell: there are waaay to many scripts. My logic is this: if (errorp1 != '0') { addclass('.step-error') to step1 ..
[14:06:06] <Cork> 23:06 <_<
[14:06:21] <BillCriswell> Cork: Sissy.
[14:06:24] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[14:06:27] <Cork> :)
[14:06:35] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell: layin' down the law
[14:06:37] <Cork> well i go up at 6 so...
[14:07:01] <ShawnRisk> Well can anyone else help me as this is weird on how come this will not work
[14:07:10] <ShawnRisk> I mean this looks like it should
[14:07:40] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk what's bugging you?
[14:07:46] <BillCriswell> madalin: That's fine if you know that error1 is not 0. Do console.log( errorp1 ) and look at the console. log all the things!
[14:08:21] <madalin> BillCriswell: i did. errorp1 is 0, but errop2 is not 0 so thats why the script is not working..
[14:09:01] <BillCriswell> Where is errop2?
[14:09:09] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: how come add, remove and switch class not doing anything, in this code: http://pastebin.com/3S1Hy2yH
[14:09:55] <duch_kazatel> $('#logo'); is not matching anything when the code is run?
[14:10:16] <BillCriswell> madalin: Ok, var er = '0'; er++ still leaves er at '0'
[14:10:37] <BillCriswell> You need to do var er = 0; then you can do er++
[14:10:52] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: <div id="logo"></div> is in my code
[14:11:26] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk is the code you linked in a document ready?
[14:11:34] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk or is it just at the top of the page?
[14:11:55] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: the pastbin is all my jquery ode
[14:11:57] <ShawnRisk> code*
[14:12:09] <duch_kazatel> and i'll bet this code is up somewhere in the <head>?
[14:12:17] <BillCriswell> Do we have a bot that can run code up in this bitch?
[14:12:31] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: in an external file but linked in the head
[14:12:45] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk that's why.  you're running the code before the document is ready.
[14:12:55] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk basically, the code runs before anything exists on the page.
[14:13:06] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: where should I put this?
[14:13:17] <ShawnRisk> or should I use onload?
[14:13:39] <duch_kazatel> neither - do this: http://jsfiddle.net/BYD68/
[14:13:56] <duch_kazatel> that's shorthand for using $( document ).ready(function() {});
[14:16:36] <newbsduser>  $( document ).on( "pageinit",  it works first open of page... when i go back and go to page again
[14:16:39] <newbsduser> init function doesnt work
[14:16:54] <newbsduser> i want to run a function for each visit of page
[14:17:02] <newbsduser> page = a div
[14:17:04] <duch_kazatel> newbsduser you need to emit that event.
[14:17:05] <newbsduser> it s jquery mobile
[14:17:14] <newbsduser> how can do that duch_kazatel
[14:17:28] <duch_kazatel> newbsduser not sure.  i don't use jquery mobile.
[14:19:41] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: that works but how come?
[14:19:58] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk I explained it.
[14:20:15] <synth_> when i use ajax to post data, like: data: {"action":"hide", "value": 1, "uid": uid}; shouldn't the file receiving the post see this as json data? even when running: $json = json_encode($_POST); echo gettype($json["value"]); it's showing it as a string
[14:20:18] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: oh okay I get it
[14:20:23] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk when you put JS up above your HTML, it'll run before the html is "ready"
[14:20:32] <ShawnRisk> okay
[14:20:33] <duch_kazatel> that's why you wrap it in a document ready like that
[14:20:50] <duch_kazatel> synth_ that's because it's a string in transit.
[14:21:17] <synth_> duch_kazatel okay, but shouldn't json_encode convert all of that accordingly though?
[14:21:59] <zumba_addict> is it possible to change the color of a button when disabled is true?
[14:22:16] <duch_kazatel> synth_ you need to handle that on the other end.
[14:23:04] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict sure, when you change the color of the button - you need to hardcode your css there or add a class, then have the class use the appropriate styles.
[14:23:15] <synth_> duch_kazatel yeah that's what i'm trying to run in php is json_encode; i guess this is more a question for ##php
[14:23:25] <duch_kazatel> synth_ bingo
[14:23:27] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:23:38] <zumba_addict> ok, it's weird because there are 2 buttons that are close together. When they get disabled, it looks like one huge button :)
[14:24:22] <duch_kazatel> hah
[14:24:24] <zumba_addict> just saw there is a specific csss for it :)
[14:24:29] <zumba_addict> i'll add a class
[14:24:30] <duch_kazatel> there you go!
[14:31:38] <zumba_addict> how will I refer to this code? <button type="button" class="submit gray-disabled-button" disabled="">Rename</button>
[14:32:18] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: how come when I try to shrink the image width to 100px this just happens but going big happens very slowly?
[14:32:47] <zumba_addict> is this correct? button[disabled=disabled].submit.gray-disabled-button
[14:34:21] <zumba_addict> nope, it doesn't work
[14:46:52] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: still around?
[14:47:00] <duch_kazatel> yeah just got back from being outside.
[14:47:18] <duch_kazatel> drank a bit more than i meant to on lunch, so i'm trollin' around.
[14:49:10] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: How come the logo goes from big to small very fast when I want this to shrink and then goes slowly when growing from small to big?
[14:49:21] <duch_kazatel> what are you looking at?
[14:49:48] <duch_kazatel> also: that's what she said.
[14:50:13] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: the pastebin code I showed you but can put this back up if you don't have this anymore
[14:50:27] <duch_kazatel> please resend
[14:51:36] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/qvbe9WyD
[14:51:36] <igcewieling> Is there any reason not to put everything inside $(document).ready(
[14:51:55] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling sure - if there's code you don't want to wait until document ready.
[14:52:16] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling sometimes there are things you can do that you don't need to wait for.
[14:52:27] <igcewieling> fair point.  No other reason?
[14:52:41] <duch_kazatel> i mean, if you want your code to wait for some reason, go ahead?
[14:53:01] <igcewieling> I can't think of anything I'd need to do before the document is ready
[14:53:17] <duch_kazatel> you could declare functions, create objects, etc that don't rely on elements.
[14:53:54] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk why are you using switchClass AND adding/removing classes manually?
[14:54:00] <igcewieling> thanks.  I was making sure I wasn't missing anything obvious to someone more familiar with JS than I am
[14:54:36] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:55:48] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: no reason.  I was testing this out but if you think that is not proper I can change the code.
[14:56:07] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk you do realize you're duplicating logic there, right?
[14:56:23] <duch_kazatel> .switchClass() removes the first class while adding the second.
[14:57:04] <duch_kazatel> and you have jqueryui loaded on the page, right?
[14:57:41] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I thought you were going to say that, and yes I do.
[14:57:49] <duch_kazatel> cool
[14:58:08] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I still need the first addClass right?
[14:58:37] <duch_kazatel> dunno.  your code doesn't make any sense to me.  $(this).ready(function() { - what do you think this is doing?
[14:59:00] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: the same as: $(function() {
[14:59:09] <duch_kazatel> remove that wrapper.
[14:59:17] <duch_kazatel> totally unnecessary now.
[14:59:25] <duch_kazatel> you've got a doc ready in a doc ready.  yo dawg.
[14:59:51] <duch_kazatel> also, you're caching your logo selector and then not using it  on line 8.
[15:00:30] <synth_> is there a way to reload a document, like the equivalent of pressing "CTRL + R"? For some reason, location.reload() doesn't re-evaluate the page's php it seems.. almost like it's reloading it from cache
[15:00:56] <duch_kazatel> synth_ that's because it's probably caching the output.  you can set cache-control headers though.
[15:01:09] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: right I know.
[15:01:19] <synth_> duch_kazatel using php? or through jquery?
[15:01:30] <duch_kazatel> synth_ on the php side probably.
[15:01:36] <duch_kazatel> or your server.  i can't remember right now.
[15:02:30] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk so clean that stuff up and go from there. see what's up.
[15:03:33] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: back to the question at hand, how do I make sure the logo is animating when shrinking and growing?  I want people to see that this is growing and shrinking slowly.  Does this mean I need fadein and fadeout?
[15:03:54] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: or can I do this with css and that is faster?
[15:04:25] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk i would explicitly animate the properties you want animated, but that's because i like being explicit.
[15:04:47] <duch_kazatel> because as it stands, your code should work, depending on what those classes have in them.
[15:06:34] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: which is the logo.  The animation is not working out when going from small to big.  This is waiting a second or two and then going straight to big without animating.
[15:12:35] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: any other thoughts?
[15:12:43] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk sorry - getting pulled around. coldfusion blows.
[15:12:56] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: use to do that, and this really does
[15:13:59] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:14:30] <ShawnRisk> okay
[15:16:51] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I should leave here in twenty mins
[15:20:04] <christophe_v_e> Hey, I'm looking for a way to hover an image, and while hovered it should rapidly flash several images in a random sequence .. any ideas where to start my search for something like this?
[15:27:58] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I have to go thanks for the help, I will try later to figure out the rest.
[15:28:04] <duch_kazatel> good luck man.
[15:28:11] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: thanks.
[15:28:18] <duch_kazatel> christophe_v_e - start by looking at event binding.
[15:29:29] <christophe_v_e> Ok, I'm looking into hovering - but it's not like there's an existing blueprint I can use to do this, right?
[15:29:48] <duch_kazatel> christophe_v_e not really - but look at jquery's .on().
[15:29:58] <christophe_v_e> alright, thanks
[15:35:27] <duch_kazatel> christophe_v_e sorry my connection dropped.
[15:35:33] <duch_kazatel> did you see my suggestion?
[15:52:54] <kazm> hey guys, I want to make a scroll-down effect like the header at http://distinction.co.uk/, can someone tell me what I would use?
[15:56:08] <jwmann> What would be the best way to push jQuery object into an array so that later I can iterate through the array and select those objects
[16:01:18] <beachandbytes> obj = [];
[16:01:25] <beachandbytes> obj.push($(items))
[16:01:39] <kazm> any help for poor ol me?
[16:02:33] <beachandbytes> one sec
[16:03:43] <kazm> is there a website that helps understand jquery ppl use?  like that reformats so its readable?
[16:04:04] <kazm> and like filtered by element selection?
[16:04:33] <kazm> i find it really hard to learn jquery from example sites
[16:05:07] <igcewieling> http://api.jquery.com/ and google is what I use.
[16:06:16] <kazm> but when i see an effect on a site i really like, for example with css i can easily learn what was done
[16:06:23] <kazm> just inspect
[16:11:32] <beachandbytes> kazm, it looks like they just switch between two different headers on scroll
[16:11:53] <igcewieling> ah.  I'm not good enough with JS to understand most of that stuff by inspecting the code.  The site you showed looks to me like the padding is animated
[16:13:22] <kazm> is there some easier way to tell
[16:13:47] <kazm> like it can be done multilpe ways as you describe, but i'd love to be able to tell as fast as google developer lets me read css
[16:18:17] <beachandbytes> kazm (window).scroll(function(){n(this).scrollTop()!=0?(n("header").addClass("fixed"),n("body").addClass("fixed")):(n("header").removeClass("fixed"),n("body").removeClass("fixed"))})}
[16:18:27] <beachandbytes> the rest is just css
[16:19:13] <decx> sticky header script?
[16:20:16] <beachandbytes> ya
[16:30:19] <synth_> when doing location.reload(); is there a clever way to go back to the scrolled position on the document when reloaded?
[16:37:25] <ankurk> Has anyone tried to use this library with jQuery dialogs?
[16:37:28] <ankurk> http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/jquery-ui.html
[16:41:35] <kazm> thanks for effort beach
[16:41:37] <kazm> i will study that
[16:44:16] <kazm> hmm seems like if statement without if, and n() rather than $()?
[16:50:56] <duch_kazatel> kazm huh
[16:51:05] <decx> kazm you can assign a custom variable for jQuery.noConflict
[16:51:17] <duch_kazatel> oh that's what they're asking,
[16:52:11] <decx> til you can use unicode for that
[16:52:19] <decx> brb wrapping all my stuff in snowman
[16:52:31] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[16:52:48] <duch_kazatel> imo LOD instead.
[16:53:12] <duch_kazatel> for error handling
[16:53:16] <decx> i dont get it
[16:54:03] <kazm> i dont understand, what can i search to read this
[16:54:39] <decx> jquery replace dollar
[16:57:59] <duch_kazatel> kazm you want noConflict.
[16:58:40] <duch_kazatel> (à² _à² ) - LOD
[16:58:50] <kazm> ic interesting
[16:58:51] <duch_kazatel> use that for wrapping your error handlers.
[17:00:36] <decx> oh right, i thought of legion of doom and thought what do bulky men in red spiked breastplates got to do with error handling
[17:00:45] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[17:00:47] <duch_kazatel> and kazm http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/
[17:02:56] <vinex08> are there any sites similar to try.jquery??  i have already completed the free course. :)  i want moar
[17:02:58] <vinex08> or may be you can give me some mini challenge, just something to work with...
[17:04:04] <duch_kazatel> vinex08 are you learning just to learn?
[17:04:16] <kazm> i just did that course too
[17:04:25] <kazm> was cool
[17:05:21] <kazm> i'm trying to build a fill-width slider with corresponding tab, should i start from scratch or try usinh jquery ui?
[17:05:45] <kazm> not too fond that i have to include picked css stuff
[17:06:13] <decx> i like flexslider
[17:08:10] <kazm> i reall want to add animation to tabs
[17:08:16] <kazm> really*
[17:08:25] <duch_kazatel> kazm what kind of animation?
[17:08:34] <decx> yeah dont bother with jqui for that imho
[17:08:41] <decx> it can be a bit clunky
[17:08:46] <christophe_v_e> duch_kazatel: this is exactly what i was looking for: http://buildinternet.com/2011/09/cycle-through-images-on-hover-with-jquery/
[17:08:53] <vinex08> nahh, i think my skills in jQuery are still in basic..
[17:09:47] <kazm> originally i wanted slider like https://www.namecheap.com/ under header, but i'd like to be able to do more
[17:10:03] <kazm> like adding animation transitions, but not sure what to build off
[17:10:14] <duch_kazatel> i don't like jqueryui
[17:10:33] <duch_kazatel> christophe_v_e i can't even remember what your question was.
[17:10:42] <ankurk> Hey guys the function here on line 293, doesn't get executed, why? http://pastebin.com/3XK7iXSA
[17:11:04] <ankurk> I am basically trying to use the file upload inside jQuery dialog
[17:11:15] <christophe_v_e> i wanted to hover an image to then cycle through images while hovering :)
[17:11:30] <duch_kazatel> christophe_v_e that's right.  yeah you want a carusel opn hover.
[17:11:41] <duch_kazatel> ankurk that paste is private bro.
[17:12:07] <ankurk> Made public, http://pastebin.com/3XK7iXSA
[17:12:08] <ankurk> :)
[17:12:15] <ankurk> my bad
[17:12:22] <kazm> so if i want to make the tab nav like at namecheap.com should i use jquery or jqueryui?
[17:12:24] <snover> from the looks of it it might have been wiser to leave it that way
[17:12:32] <duch_kazatel> kazm jqueryui require jquery
[17:13:02] <duch_kazatel> ankurk why are you duplicating document readies?  put all that code in one.
[17:13:34] <kazm> ok, my question is still valid
[17:13:36] <ankurk> means? $(function) is essentially document.ready?
[17:13:43] <duch_kazatel> ankurk yes.
[17:14:13] <duch_kazatel> kazm not really - by virtue of using jqueryUI, you're also using jquery.  if you're asking if you should use jqueryui at all, that's up to you.  I'd suggest not, but that's me.
[17:16:27] <decx> duch_kazatel any suggestions for an ui autocomplete alternative?
[17:17:06] <decx> i hacked something together that works with solr but it's not as slick, if you can call the ui autocomplete slick
[17:17:35] <ankurk> so it should be good now? http://pastebin.com/3XK7iXSA
[17:18:59] <duch_kazatel> decx i'd hand-roll one, but we have in-house designers soooo...
[17:19:00] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:21:16] <decx> i think i just try to make my own better then, good opportunity to learn ^^
[17:21:25] <duch_kazatel> that's what i'd do.
[17:21:32] <duch_kazatel> do you own thang.
[17:26:08] <decx> first lesson learned, don't use change but input ;)
[17:26:29] <duch_kazatel> haha
[17:30:17] <ankurk> one more question I shouldn't have any issues using the file upload library inside a jQuery dialog right?
[17:47:09] <zumba_addict> how come, everytime I dynamically add a new class to an element, the previous working css properties gets broken?
[17:48:44] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: That doesn't sound right.
[17:49:02] <zumba_addict> the class I added isn't in .css file yet. That could be the issue
[17:49:48] <BillCriswell> In that case adding a class won't do anything?
[17:49:52] <BillCriswell> I'm confused.
[17:51:01] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: http://jsbin.com/otuvegif/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[17:51:26] <zumba_addict> looking
[17:52:40] <zumba_addict> i'll use that approach
[17:53:42] <BillCriswell> Were you just replacing the previous class name?
[17:53:57] <zumba_addict> no, I added it
[17:54:08] <zumba_addict> it became class="submit done"
[17:54:22] <zumba_addict> when I added done, the button's appearance, location changed
[17:54:48] <zumba_addict> I think I have a solution but I don't know if it can be added inside $('')
[17:55:02] <zumba_addict> Here is the code, <button type="button" class="submit">Done</button>
[17:55:15] <zumba_addict> i already have a listener for button.submit
[17:55:28] <zumba_addict> but now, I want to add the word Done. How do I include it?
[17:55:42] <zumba_addict> $('button.submit').hide()
[17:55:53] <zumba_addict> now with the word Done, how should it be coded?
[17:57:06] <zumba_addict> tried this, it didn't work, $('button.submit[value="Done"]').hide()
[17:57:34] <kazm> "This widget requires some functional CSS, otherwise it won't work. If you build a custom theme, use the widget's specific CSS file as a starting point." from http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/.  Where do i get this CSS file?
[17:59:08] <zumba_addict> looks like it's not possible
[18:09:04] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: You can still select it with just button.submit
[18:09:14] <zumba_addict> I know but I already have an event for that
[18:09:25] <zumba_addict> i have a solution but just don't know how to edit the class
[18:09:40] <zumba_addict> button[class="submit"] how do I add another class to that
[18:09:59] <zumba_addict> button[class="submit otherClass anotherClass"] like this?
[18:09:59] <BillCriswell> You wouldn't need to do that, just button.submit would be fine.
[18:10:07] <zumba_addict> you don't understand me
[18:10:12] <BillCriswell> You can do button.submit.otherClass.anotherClass
[18:10:22] <zumba_addict> oh ok
[18:10:32] <zumba_addict> what if using the [ ] bracket style?
[18:10:49] <BillCriswell> If you already have an event attached to that button why are you worried about the other class name?
[18:11:12] <BillCriswell> Your example would be fine, but I'm not sure you can count on the other the browser applies the class names.
[18:11:14] <zumba_addict> because I have another event that I need to call.
[18:11:21] <zumba_addict> The button text changes from Rename to Done
[18:11:45] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: That's weird, but the original event would still be attached to the button.
[18:11:59] <zumba_addict> no, it doesn't get called anymore
[18:12:08] <zumba_addict> i tried it and it didn't call it
[18:12:14] <BillCriswell> Are you replacing the button entirely?
[18:12:26] <zumba_addict> just the text and also added a new class
[18:12:47] <zumba_addict> The previous text was Rename and class was class="submit"
[18:13:06] <zumba_addict> when Rename is successful, I change it to Done and addClass("submitDone")
[18:13:35] <zumba_addict> They want it like this because beside the Done button is Undo
[18:15:17] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: Ok.
[18:15:26] <zumba_addict> I'm trying it now
[18:15:53] <zumba_addict> It worked!!! :)
[18:16:01] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[18:16:33] <zumba_addict> I edited the css file and added button[class="submit submitDone"] beside the existing button[class="submit"] :)
[18:16:52] <zumba_addict> I'll work on Undo now :)
[18:17:05] <zumba_addict> Undo is a tough one
[18:17:29] <zumba_addict> but I'll put console.log to make sure that the button.submit isn't really being called anymore
[18:18:18] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: http://jsbin.com/otuvegif/2/edit?html,js,output here is my demo.
[18:18:26] <zumba_addict> you are right, it got called. I have to fix this
[18:19:31] <zumba_addict> how do I prevent it from being called?
[18:24:05] <zumba_addict> i did a removeClass and it didn't call the button.submit anymore :) but I need to fix the css
[18:25:25] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: It still should be.
[18:25:46] <zumba_addict> should be what?
[18:26:22] <zumba_addict> perfect, no more calling of the first button.submit :)
[18:29:21] <BillCriswell> The event exists on the element. You can do anything to it and it'll retain the event.
[18:31:12] <zumba_addict> We are using backboneJS events
[18:31:45] <zumba_addict> I have a 'click .submit' : submitFunction and also 'click .submitDone' : submitDoneFunction
[18:32:10] <BillCriswell> Ah, got it.
[18:32:10] <zumba_addict> When the text shows Done, I also execute $('button.submit').removeClass('submit')
[18:32:24] <zumba_addict> :)
[18:32:39] <zumba_addict> I've been testing it multiple times and there aren't really issues anymore! :)
[18:32:49] <zumba_addict> I can now start working on the Undo
[18:32:52] <zumba_addict> woohoo
[18:33:29] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: Niiice. Enjoy.
[18:33:39] <zumba_addict> Thanks for the help too! :)
[18:33:57] <zumba_addict> oh btw the way, is there a Chrome plugin that can throttle our bandwidth?
[18:34:22] <zumba_addict> I would like to make the REST calls slower so I can see spinner.gif longer
[18:34:38] <zumba_addict> it's for our QA
[18:34:50] <zumba_addict> she might complain, spinner.gif is too fast and goes away,LOL
[18:54:22] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: Slowing down things can help oddly enough from a user experience point of view.
[18:55:14] <zumba_addict> I got it working using ipfw command :) it's awesome
[18:55:26] <zumba_addict> I will suggest it to our QA folks
[19:05:07] <TheEmpath1> howdy
[19:05:33] <TheEmpath1> so using jquery 1.11, and it uses Object.defineProperty for Android support
[19:05:37] <TheEmpath1> but that doesn't work for IE8
[19:05:44] <TheEmpath1> this is a problem... any way around it?
[19:13:04] <igcewieling> join #css
[19:13:24] <TheEmpath1> its not a css issue
[19:13:26] <TheEmpath1> o
[19:13:32] <TheEmpath1> you typed a wrong command
[19:33:44] <zumba_addict> hi folks, can we use .html to grab value rather than .val()?
[19:34:14] <zumba_addict> I have this code, fieldsetPriortoChanges = $('fieldset.devicefset').html()
[19:34:51] <zumba_addict> I need the value on the fieldsetPriortoChanges. I mean value="myName"
[19:40:48] <zumba_addict> ignore
[19:54:35] <b-lew> is there a way to put this string into php?
[19:54:38] <b-lew> <button type="button" onclick="$.sidr('close', 'sidr');">Close</button>
[19:54:54] <b-lew> I'm unsure how to do that.
[19:55:57] <b-lew> the single quotes are throwing it off.
[21:05:24] <fattest> how do i make make my bootstrap modal show on form submit? http://jsfiddle.net/dm4Nn/38/
[21:21:05] <becom33> Hi everyone , http://pastebin.com/XBwM3i5f this is how Im inserting the same nav bar into pages . the problem is a I cannot access this navigation with js . I was thinking maybe it was because its inserting from a another page . what I want to do is to remove a class in the selected 'li a'  tag
[21:21:17] <becom33> if someone could help me that would be really great
[21:22:33] * becom33 anyone
[21:26:40] * becom33 hello ? anyone here ?
[21:56:33] <zumba_addict> what could be the reason why $(':input[name=name]').focus() doesn't work during runtime but works when I type it in console?
[21:58:23] <aniasis> what is the difference between Foo.bar and Foo.prototype.bar ?
[22:43:15] <zulcc> $('#foo').on('click', 'a', function(e) { .. }); what is $(this) in here?
[22:49:03] <doug65536> zulcc: a jquery selector that refers to #foo
[22:49:20] <doug65536> zulcc: a jquery selector that refers to a... sorry
[22:49:46] <zulcc> while delegating like this, how would you .each() the <a>'s?
[22:50:17] <zulcc> or rather select the 'a' in the delegation
[22:50:26] <doug65536> I would do $(e.currentTarget).find('a')
[22:50:49] <zulcc> thanks!
[22:50:54] <doug65536> e.currentTarget would be #foo
[22:51:40] <doug65536> or, shorthand, $('a', e.currentTarget)
[22:51:46] <zulcc>  < doug65536> zulcc: a jquery selector that refers to a... sorry    << oh wait, if it does refer to 'a', then i can just use $(this)
[22:51:47] <Uhkis> wouldnt $('#foo a').. be simpler?
[22:51:59] <Uhkis> or is it slower or something
[22:52:05] <zulcc> Uhkis: yes, but that's not delegated to #foo
[22:52:51] <doug65536> Uhkis: well, if the event handler were used for more than one thing, you couldn't assume #foo. that would work too though
[22:53:34] <doug65536> zulcc: I thought you wanted all the 'a's under foo
[22:54:03] <zulcc> doug65536: no, i want $(this) a
[22:58:48] <doug65536> zulcc: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/b9vNB/1/
[23:01:42] <doug65536> zulcc: so yes, just use $(this) to refer to the 'a' they clicked
[23:03:36] <zulcc> doug65536: thanks!
[23:06:39] <zulcc> i guess i can't use these selecor wildcards like this http://jsfiddle.net/B7g47/1/
[23:07:53] <doug65536> zulcc: not like that, but...
[23:09:18] <doug65536> zulcc: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/B7g47/3/
[23:09:37] <doug65536> I wouldn't recommend it but it's a decent way to do it
[23:09:48] <doug65536> don't use class for data. use data attributes
[23:11:20] <zulcc> doug65536: thank you!
[23:12:24] <doug65536> proof that 'bar' occurring mid-class-name is handled btw http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/B7g47/4/
[23:13:14] <doug65536> \b in a regex means "word boundary", meaning, between words, or start of string
[23:14:41] <doug65536> further proof that it works http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/B7g47/5/
[23:14:42] <zulcc> yeah but how come you just throw in regex without escaping or anything... call a test function on a regex string?
[23:15:37] <doug65536> zulcc: you only need to escape the regex itself. the regex input is just the raw input.
[23:16:03] <doug65536> .test gives true/false whether it matches
[23:16:45] <doug65536> if the "bar" part inside the /.../ was input that could be anything, yes, I would need to escape it
[23:24:15] <Hilton> I have a text box and a select. I want the select options to change when the text box is updated. Is a change event on the text box the best way to go, or something else? Is there a way to use select's click event but only when opened?
[23:29:26] <prtksxna> Hilton: You could use 'keydown' on the text box, that way the event would get triggered as soon as someone starts typing
[23:30:09] <Hilton> Ooo, no no, I only want the <select> to update when they finish in the <input> (or choose something from the BS typeahead list).
[23:30:50] <Hilton> Initially I wanted to update it when they actually clicked on the <select>, but click also responds when they choose from the dropdown list which mucks everything up.
[23:31:15] <prtksxna> Hilton: onchange then?
[23:31:33] <Hilton> Is there a way to do that? Write a function on a that responds only when trying to OPEN a select dropdown list, not when choosing an item?
[23:32:16] <Hilton> Or maybe I can change it to a button. Hmm.
[23:38:41] <Rou> Who even uses javascript
[23:38:45] <Rou> Not a real programming language
[23:41:46] <Hilton> You're right. It's a scripting language. I'm glad you are intelligent enough to make that distinction.
[23:42:11] <Hilton> Object Pascal, on the other hand. That's a real programming language.
[23:56:02] <mindis|wurk> hola. any colorbox expers around? i'm trying to get colorbox to open on page load for the first colorbox link on a page and the popup does appear but it gets stuck in some weird loop where it flips between the loading animation and the image it's trying to show
