[00:07:03] <RockinAkin> Cork:  can you tell me what I'm doing wrong in my version of your code?  http://jsfiddle.net/LNvzQ/1/
[00:07:38] <RockinAkin> your version stops the range slider, but this one doesnt
[00:07:44] <RockinAkin> so I'm confused what I'm missing
[00:08:12] <Cork> input.val(7); <--
[00:08:18] <Cork> input is a number not an element
[00:08:34] <Cork> or rather its a string not an element

[00:10:56] <RockinAkin> oh snap
[00:10:59] <RockinAkin> :)
[00:11:13] <RockinAkin> im slowly learning

[00:11:31] <RockinAkin> thank you!
[00:13:44] <RockinAkin> am i doing anything else stupid in my code?
[00:15:28] <Cork> RockinAkin: over all that code is ok
[00:18:54] <RockinAkin> sweet.  thanks for your help Cork
[00:18:59] <Cork> np
[00:24:58] <HelperW> morning.
[00:33:55] <Xliff> Cork++
[00:34:52] <dazziola> Hi all
[00:35:55] <dazziola> Having a bit of an issue with a jQuery hover event firing three separate times when it is entered from an element not in the viewport. (eg. If the mouse comes from the toolbar/address bar immediately into the element)
[00:36:38] <dazziola> The issue seems limited to Chrome only. I have a few console logs triggering for each event - fiddle output here: http://fiddle.jshell.net/z2DLg/1/show/
[00:40:21] <Jattenalle> no luck with that yet dazziola?
[00:40:35] <Jattenalle> did you report it as a bug to chrome? because it seems like a bug
[00:41:14] <Xliff> I'm checking it, dazziola
[00:41:17] <dazziola> I haven't yet Jattanalle
[00:41:23] <dazziola> Thanks Xliff
[00:41:24] <Xliff> Trying to clean it up a bit.
[00:41:46] <dazziola> It's not the prettiest yet as it was meant to be part of a proof of concept
[00:41:48] <HelperW> sI receive the following output from javascript: {"id":"1","code":"1a","firstname":"Bert","lastname":"Gibbers","street":"Lazy Berry Edge","no":"35","email":"stone@meekness.com","phone":"202-555-0102"}0
[00:41:50] <Sjobidoo> hi ho :) Anyone know a simple way of testing if a object has all its keys' values != false / if they're set? :)
[00:42:05] <HelperW> This all is in my response variable. How can I easy get for example the street?
[00:42:12] <HelperW> response.street is not working.
[00:42:47] <Jattenalle> HelperW, are you parsing it as json?
[00:42:51] <cannap> hi
[00:42:51] <HelperW> yes
[00:43:00] <Jattenalle> then whatever.street should work
[00:43:31] <HelperW> jQuery.post(ajax_url, data, function(response) {  .. console.log(response); } gives me that string above
[00:43:32] <Jattenalle> Sjobidoo, all the keys?
[00:43:38] <HelperW> string - object.
[00:43:45] <HelperW> but response.street is doing nothing.
[00:44:03] <Jattenalle> HelperW, response is a string, not an object
[00:44:12] <systemfault> HelperW: Tell us what console.log(typeof response); is giving you.
[00:44:36] <Jattenalle> you need to parse it as json
[00:44:58] <Sjobidoo> Jattenalle: yeah..I create a global object first..setting some keys..ie: myobject = { 'key1':false,'key2':false} . Then set the values later on ..so i'm trying to run a check if all values are != false at some point
[00:45:08] <systemfault> HelperW: You can tell jQuery to parse the JSON by adding an extra parameter at the end of $.post    'json'
[00:45:44] <Jattenalle> Sjobidoo, no way other than just going over all the keys and values and checking
[00:46:03] <Sjobidoo> Jattenalle: aha ok...thanks :)
[00:46:06] <Jattenalle> Sjobidoo, look into .each()
[00:46:54] <Jattenalle> Sjobidoo, $(Object.keys(someobject)).each(function(i,e){ if(someobject[e]!= false){ do something} });
[00:47:06] <Jattenalle> there are other ways to do it, but i like that way
[00:47:12] <Sjobidoo> Jattenalle: great..thanks :D
[00:47:38] <Xliff> There was a function in jQuery that allowed you to break out of the list if a condition was not met.
[00:47:44] <Xliff> Forgot the name of it.
[00:48:38] <Jattenalle> Xliff, i dont think that'd work in this case
[00:48:51] * Jattenalle shrugs
[00:48:56] <Jattenalle> it could be made to work, nevermind me
[00:49:15] <Xliff> It would if all you wanted to find is if the object ever found an element was NOT set.
[00:49:23] <Xliff> Then you could break out and just return false.
[00:49:30] <Xliff> And not have to iterate over the entire list.
[00:50:02] <HelperW> http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/6LG
[00:50:04] <Jattenalle> well returning false from the function in each will also stop the iteration
[00:50:09] <HelperW> is what i get
[00:50:11] <Jattenalle> in .each()
[00:50:16] <Xliff> OK
[00:50:25] <Xliff> Maybe that's what I was thinking.
[00:50:38] <Jattenalle> HelperW, why is there a trailing 0?
[00:50:50] <Jattenalle> also, it's still a damned string!
[00:51:02] <Jattenalle> parse it as json or add the parameter
[00:52:39] <HelperW> hmmm
[00:52:43] <HelperW> I do :
[00:52:47] <HelperW>     echo json_encode($results[0]);
[00:53:16] <Xliff> dazziola: http://fiddle.jshell.net/z2DLg/3/show/ <- Looks like chrome is throwing extra mouse events in this case.
[00:53:17] <HelperW> http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/6LH  that is my whole script ( have to change some js checks yet but I would like to retrieve the values already. )
[00:53:23] <Woet> HelperW: why is there a 0 at the end?
[00:53:47] <HelperW> maybe is that the 0 from the echo ? in the json encode?
[00:53:58] <Woet> if you look at http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/6LG
[00:54:00] <Woet> there is a 0 behind the reason
[00:54:08] <Woet> err, the json *
[00:54:09] <dazziola> Xliff: I saw that alright. Seems odd, goes full circle whereas FF etc dont
[00:54:14] <Woet> which means it's invalid json.
[00:54:38] <HelperW> Oh :s
[00:54:41] <Jattenalle> also you need to parse it, not encode it again -_-
[00:54:54] <Jattenalle> nevermind, that's server side
[00:55:23] <HelperW> Im a new to those calls. Sorry if im not doing it right from the first time.
[00:55:31] <HelperW> Im not yet sure where I am doing now wrong things.
[00:55:36] <HelperW> My json is not well formed?
[00:56:00] <Xliff> dazziola: I think this would probably work better if you iused mouseenter and mouseleave instead of hover
[00:56:03] <Woet> HelperW: add exit; after your echo.
[00:56:15] <Woet> i think someone after your echo json_encode another part of your script echos a 0.
[00:57:06] <HelperW> the 0 is gone after i set the exit.
[00:57:08] <HelperW> {"id":"1","code":"1a","firstname":"Bert","lastname":"Gibbers","street":"Lazy Berry Edge","no":"35","email":"stone@meekness.com","phone":"202-555-0102"}
[00:57:27] <HelperW> But I guess now its still a string?
[00:58:22] <dazziola> Xliff: I've tried that, same thing happens! The three events fired
[00:58:32] <Woet> HelperW: and you added 'json' at the end of the .post?
[00:58:46] <dazziola> Xliff: Again, mouseenter and leave work perfectly in FF
[00:59:12] <Woet> HelperW: also, you aren't returning a JSON header
[00:59:22] <Cork> Sjobidoo: you could use Object.keys, but it has some browser dependencies
[00:59:35] <Woet> either add 'json' at the end of the .post like systemfault told you or add a header with the json mime type in the PHP
[00:59:45] <Woet> else jquery can't really guess it.
[01:01:27] <HelperW> So here you would ike to add .json?
[01:01:40] <HelperW> http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/6LI
[01:02:00] <Cork> Woet: the json in the .post call doesn't fix the response problem
[01:02:04] <Cork> only the header does that
[01:02:12] <Woet> Cork: would it not be parsed as json?
[01:02:15] <Cork> no
[01:02:24] <Cork> 'json' means "request json"
[01:02:31] <Cork> it doesn't mean "force the response to be json"
[01:02:32] <Xliff> dazziola: http://fiddle.jshell.net/z2DLg/7/show <- Mostly working
[01:02:39] <Xliff> But still some weirdness with the events.
[01:02:41] <Jattenalle> or you could just parse the string you recieve
[01:02:43] <Cork> what the server says it returns is what it will be taken as
[01:02:50] <Cork> Jattenalle: ya, but that is hacky
[01:02:54] <Xliff> Usually happens when you come from outside the browser window and directly exit the hot spot.
[01:02:58] <Jattenalle> Cork, it works ;)
[01:03:05] <Cork> the server lies, so it should be fixed
[01:03:28] <HelperW> so: I have to set the header('Content-Type: application/json'); header?
[01:03:33] <Cork> yes
[01:03:50] <Cork> if you don't you will send text/html
[01:03:52] <Cork> not json
[01:04:16] <Cork> (as webservers default to text/html if nothing is sat)
[01:05:19] <Woet> Cork: you're wrong.
[01:05:24] <Cork> no
[01:05:44] <Woet> well, yes: http://woet.me/tmp/
[01:06:14] <Woet> the response headers are the same
[01:06:15] <Cork> ok fine
[01:06:25] <Cork> normally servers default to it
[01:06:49] <Cork> but you can configure the server to do pre 1.0 http submission
[01:07:03] <Cork> but then the browser will fall into legacy mode and some will sniff the content
[01:07:08] <Cork> and some will default to text/html
[01:07:14] <k_sze[work]> hmm, somehow using jQuery's prop() function to change the 'checked' property of a checkbox does not fire its 'change' event.
[01:07:19] <Cork> (you ALWAYS want to send a Content-Type)
[01:07:20] <HelperW> blah
[01:07:41] <Cork> k_sze[work]: sure events is for user changes, not script changes
[01:07:58] <Cork> k_sze[work]: simplest is to just use .click() on the element
[01:07:59] <Woet> HelperW: add header("Content-Type: application/json"); before your echo json_encode
[01:08:14] <HelperW> oh before it ok.
[01:12:48] <dazziola> Xliff:Seems to be behaving the same as it always has for me?
[01:16:15] <Xliff> dazziola: Well, it's working for me. It doesn't go wonky as long as the mouse pointer stays inside the browser window.
[01:17:12] <Xliff> I'm  thinking there needs to be a latch on $(window)
[01:17:17] <dazziola> Xliff: Yeah it's fine for me when the mouse stays inside the browser window, but it would be bad UX if it went bananas when the user left with their hover and then came back in!
[01:17:30] <Xliff> True enough.
[01:17:34] <Xliff> Let me try something.
[01:18:01] <dazziola> Thanks for the help btw, not trying to sound ratty, just this has been bugging me for a good few hours over the last day
[01:18:21] <dazziola> I have opened a Chrome bug report: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=388171&thanks=388171&ts=1403596577
[01:34:01] <Xliff> dazziola: OK. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, but I have to crash.
[01:34:20] <dazziola> Xliff: Not at all, you've been great! Cheers!

[02:52:17] <FilipNortic> what is a Synkron XMLHttpRequest, sync ajax?
[02:53:06] <systemfault> Never heard of Synkron, must be some company.
[02:53:13] <systemfault> Could be anything.
[02:54:47] <Cork> cannap: doesn't look like the plugin works the way you use it
[02:55:33] <Cork> FilipNortic: its swedish for sync yes :)
[02:56:57] <FilipNortic> so if I have this warning there is a sync ajax reqeust somewhere
[02:57:19] <Cork> FilipNortic: possibly yes
[02:59:32] <FilipNortic> it shows up after  $('#arenaseatdiv').empty().load(url); is run
[03:01:15] <Cork> FilipNortic: jquery doesn't use syn ajax by default
[03:01:24] <Cork> you might have use ajaxSetup though
[03:03:13] <cannap> hmm

[03:11:37] <dddh> http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/introduction.html#html-vs-xhtml
[03:12:00] <Cork> dddh: or just use html
[03:12:23] <Cork> dddh: the browser support for xhtml is still quite poor
[03:12:30] <Cork> and you don't gain anything from going there
[03:13:07] <dddh> Cork: browser can't render xhtml if I make a single typo
[03:13:34] <Cork> dddh: ie pre ie9 doens't render xhtml
[03:13:48] <Cork> at least if you send xhtml and not broken html

[03:14:42] <Cork> dddh: unless you send Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml your sending html
[03:14:47] <dddh> "cherrypy.response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/xhtml+xml;charset=utf-8'"
[03:15:03] <Cork> dddh: and if you send xhtml without that your not sending valid html
[03:15:14] <Cork> (but your not sending xhtml either)
[03:15:21] <dddh> Cork: why not?
[03:15:29] <ZP18> fabioportieri can you help me?
[03:15:30] <Cork> cause without that header it is html
[03:15:44] <Cork> but xhtml doens't match one to one for html
[03:16:00] <dddh> I know that xhtml <> html
[03:16:07] <Cork> ex <script src=""/> is valid xhtml but not html
[03:16:32] <Cork> dddh: ya, and xhtml isn't valid html and xhtml without capplication/xhtml+xml is html not xhtml
[03:16:40] <systemfault> Does anyone who knows what he's doing still use XHTML nowadays?

[03:19:36] <ZP18> can anyone answer my q?
[03:19:42] <systemfault> dddh: XHTML is dead. Nobody uses it. There's a single reason to use it and it's if you need to transform it using XSLT

[04:14:27] <Codmadnesspro> Where do I put my javascript code into?
[04:14:44] <Cork> Codmadnesspro: not clear what you mean
[04:15:03] <Codmadnesspro> Someone from #css told me to ask where I put my javascript code
[04:15:04] <miCSu> for live testing?
[04:15:09] <Codmadnesspro> http://jsfiddle.net/6E5XZ/4/
[04:15:27] <Codmadnesspro> Where the javascript is I don't know how I can insert the javacode into my site
[04:15:55] <Cork> <script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-script/file.js"></script>
[04:17:37] <Codmadnesspro> I mean what file do I insert it in?
[04:17:44] <Codmadnesspro> Im confused xD
[04:18:04] <Codmadnesspro> I have js in assets C:\Users\Ben\Desktop\playmcpe website\buy.playmcpe.com\assets\js
[04:18:17] <Codmadnesspro> But Im not sure where and what I do with it xD
[04:19:39] <Cork> Codmadnesspro: do you know how an html file is structured?
[04:19:58] <Cork> sounds like you should start there and not at the scripting level
[04:19:58] <Codmadnesspro> Well my site is based on html, yes
[04:20:11] <Codmadnesspro> Well I just need a spoiler button
[04:20:19] <Codmadnesspro> Thats all I need :P
[04:20:30] <Codmadnesspro> But just don't know how to insert that code xD
[04:20:41] <Cork> Codmadnesspro: when you load a page the html file references what should be loaded
[04:20:55] <Cork> (and this is why i said you should start by learning html)
[04:21:18] <Codmadnesspro> I have learnt html just not js
[04:21:28] <Codmadnesspro> On the top it has   <script src="assets/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
[04:21:28] <Codmadnesspro>     <script src="assets/js/jail.js"></script>
[04:21:28] <Codmadnesspro>     <script src="assets/js/skin.js"></script>
[04:21:28] <Codmadnesspro>     <script src="assets/js/site.js"></script>
[04:21:32] <Codmadnesspro> Woops sorry
[04:21:38] <Codmadnesspro> Ill pastebin next time
[04:22:07] <PrCZeK> Hi all, I don't know if it's exist but If I have for example inputs ( http://pastebin.com/2gTqtmk7 ) how can I for example array second key of input array :/ Thanks
[04:22:36] <Cork> PrCZeK: second key??
[04:22:56] <PrCZeK> parameteroptions[0][0]
[04:22:57] <Cork> are you talking about parsing the name attribute?
[04:23:03] <PrCZeK> yes name attribut
[04:23:05] <PrCZeK> second zero
[04:23:08] <Codmadnesspro> So do you know how I insert that script into? xD
[04:23:11] <Cork> its a string
[04:23:25] <Cork> PrCZeK: so you would have to do string parsing
[04:23:54] <PrCZeK> but its example if I have a different name and need again second key how to get :/
[04:23:57] <PrCZeK> again new code ?
[04:24:02] <Cork> PrCZeK: you could do something like name.replace(']', '').split('[')
[04:24:41] <Cork> or you could use regexp
[04:24:54] <PrCZeK> regexp ? I dont know i will look at this
[04:24:55] <PrCZeK> thanks
[04:25:04] <Codmadnesspro> Omg im so confused xD
[04:25:09] <Cork> name.match(/\[()\]$/)[1]
[04:25:13] <Cork> opps
[04:25:21] <Cork> name.match(/\[([0-9]+)\]$/)[1]
[04:25:26] <PrCZeK> yes
[04:25:38] <PrCZeK> Thanks you I will look at it =)
[04:25:44] <Codmadnesspro> omg someone help xD
[04:25:52] <Codmadnesspro> Im so confused xD
[04:25:55] <Cork> Codmadnesspro: are you using a framework?
[04:26:09] <Codmadnesspro> No, not that I know of?
[04:26:24] <Codmadnesspro> What would tell me its got a framework?
[04:26:37] <Cork> have you written the entire site by hand?
[04:26:47] <Cork> or have you based it on something?
[04:27:25] <Codmadnesspro> It was a template
[04:27:36] <Codmadnesspro> I've been working on it editing css and that
[04:28:00] <Cork> Codmadnesspro: then you should ask the one making the template how it is meant to be structured
[04:28:10] <Cork> or you might be able to get help on #html
[04:28:18] <Cork> but this isn't a script qquestion
[04:28:20] <Cork> *question
[04:28:37] <Codmadnesspro> Im muted in #html for asking things lilmonkey
[04:28:41] <Codmadnesspro> xD
[04:28:52] <Codmadnesspro> I was asking a legit question and he muted me xD
[04:28:54] <Cork> Codmadnesspro: then take the hint
[04:29:03] <Cork> and start by reading a tutorial
[04:29:10] <Cork> you should learn the basics
[04:29:16] <Codmadnesspro> I have I've already looked through codeackedmy
[04:29:22] <Cork> (and this IS the basics your asking about)
[04:29:36] <Codmadnesspro> All I want is to add that java into my site
[04:29:53] <Cork> no you want to know how to load some javascript
[04:29:55] <Cork> that isn't java
[04:30:02] <Cork> and i've told you how
[04:30:14] <Cork> but you don't know enough to be able to implement the response
[04:30:24] <Cork> so you should go back and read up some more
[04:30:50] <Cork> you should at least know how html resource management work
[04:30:54] <Codmadnesspro> Wait... I think I've found the right place to insert it
[04:31:10] <Codmadnesspro> assets/js/site.js
[04:31:13] <Cork> ...
[04:31:25] <Cork> Codmadnesspro: that has nothing to do with the question you asked
[04:31:45] <Codmadnesspro> Ok now this is very confusing now xD
[04:31:48] <Cork> Codmadnesspro: and no one can answer THAT question except the one writing the template you are basing it on
[04:32:04] <Cork> Codmadnesspro: learn the basics, and ask the question on topic for the channel
[04:32:20] <Cork> how a random template is meant to be structured is NOT on topic for #jquery
[04:34:36] <Codmadnesspro> Oh well I give up :P
[04:39:07] <decx> yeah keep it on topic please, for example i want to build a table
[04:39:12] <decx> which wood should i use
[04:39:21] <Cork> :)
[04:39:47] <MikeD_> don't use tables for layout  :p
[04:40:04] <Cork> LOL
[04:40:48] <MikeD_> i suggest lawn or beach chairs
[04:43:14] <decx> "don't use tables for layout" is what my feng shui guy said too
[04:43:23] <decx> oh well
[05:17:31] <acriax> Hi, something very weird is happening for me with jquery now. Is .on() deprecated or something?
[05:18:20] <acriax> I'm using jquery 1.11.1 (tried both locally and remote), and my .on('click', function(){}); gives me TypeError: undefined is not a function
[05:18:32] <shoky> no it's not deprecated
[05:18:41] <acriax> rewriting it as .click() makes it work
[05:19:07] <acriax> Problem is, bootstrap.js also uses .on, so I get the same thing there.
[05:19:22] <shoky> maybe you have another older version of jquery included
[05:19:48] <acriax> shoky: that was my guess as well, but I couldn't find any...
[05:20:19] <shoky> console.log( $.fn.jquery )
[05:20:58] <acriax> wow, 1.4.2
[05:21:04] <systemfault> Ancient :/
[05:21:45] <seutje> smells like drupal\
[05:22:07] <acriax> haha I don't know where that comes from to be honest
[05:22:32] <acriax> using django, it's not my project and I'm no expert
[05:22:50] <seutje> oh, so ur not using a drupal 7? otherwise I knew a quick solution
[05:23:19] <acriax> but searching in files doesn't give me any results for 1.4.2
[05:23:25] <acriax> seutje: nope sorry :)
[05:23:45] <seutje> suppose you could patch in $.fn.on to map to delegate
[05:24:17] <seutje> but ideally, you'd want to update the jQuery, of course
[05:25:45] <acriax> yeah, that'd be preferrable
[05:26:03] <acriax> maybe it's some django caching on static files or something
[05:26:24] <seutje> never used django, sry
[05:26:59] <Wolf_22> I'm trying to create a tabbed menu via UL / LIs and since some of the LIs can be dynamically added, does this mean that any classes I try to apply to either the UL or the LI / links need to be done so with live / delegate / on? I finally have my styling setup but whenever I click my "add" button to add another tab, the styling breaks (which makes me think I need to attach the event handler).
[05:29:24] <acriax> Wolf_22: if you do something like $('#my-ul').on('click', 'li', function(e){console.log('clicked on a li');}); it should work, even with new li:s that gets added inside #my-ul
[05:30:43] <acriax> as opposed to $('#my-ul li').on('click', function(){}); which only will see the li:s which were there from the start
[05:31:29] <Wolf_22> acriax: Thanks. I'll try that... But what about "change?" (As opposed to click?) Is there an event like that? (Sorry--the concept of events in my mind is strange because there's so many of them that it's sometimes confusing to nail down which one should be used).
[05:31:49] <acriax> I think change only works with form elements
[05:31:57] <acriax> but don't quote me on that
[05:32:18] <acriax> http://jqapi.com/#p=change
[05:32:50] <Wolf_22> acriax: Hmmm... so if an LI is added to a UL, that doesn't count as a "change"--strange. So I guess I'll have to tie into the "add" button for my menu to acknowledge when an LI is added...
[05:33:55] <acriax> Wolf_22: maybe this will help
[05:33:56] <acriax> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1091661/detect-element-content-changes-with-jquery
[05:34:36] <acriax> the third post
[05:38:30] <Wolf_22> Thanks for the heads-up on that... Reading it right now.
[05:56:59] <acriax> is there any proper replacement for the .toggle() function?
[05:57:21] <acriax> I just want to toggle between "Show all" and "Hide all" when clicking on a button
[05:57:51] <acriax> with .toggle() it was easy, but now I have to add a data-attribute and do if-statements and set the attribute to the inverse etc
[05:57:53] <systemfault> Never heard of .toggle. I personally add/remove a class
[05:58:40] <acriax> yeah, or do that. toggleclass and then have a span inside which only shows when it's "is-showing" or something. But that doesn't seem so semantic
[06:13:06] <Hawkfire> hello all
[06:13:52] <Hawkfire> I have got a problem, how can we describe allow times or disable times on jquery simple datetimepicker?
[06:14:47] <Hawkfire> who can help me about this?
[06:15:21] <MikeD_> what?
[06:15:36] <Hawkfire> I want to describe for example allowedtimes: ['16:00','16:30'] only but how can I do this?
[06:16:14] <MikeD_> if you only allow 2 times, wouldn't it be easier to just use a drop-down?
[06:17:16] <Hawkfire> yes, there is a dropdown time strip on jquery simple datetimepicker but its not disabled other times
[06:17:34] <MikeD_> or are you going to try to force whatever time is picked into the closest match of your allowed times
[06:18:00] <Hawkfire> yes
[06:19:08] <Hawkfire> for example, will request an appointment, but appropriate for today only 16:00 and 16:30. How do I show it to the user?
[06:20:04] <Hawkfire> look like beforeShowDays
[06:21:16] <Hawkfire> example page is http://mugifly.github.io/jquery-simple-datetimepicker/jquery.simple-dtpicker.html
[06:22:04] <Hawkfire> but not shown on how to describe allowed times. There is only shown on alloweddays.
[06:22:17] <ciqsteve> Question - jqEl = $('.some-class')
[06:22:48] <ciqsteve> is there a functional difference between   $(jqEl).function  and jqEl.function
[06:22:50] <ciqsteve> ?
[06:23:13] <MikeD_> Hawkfire: sorry, idk.
[06:23:42] <shoky> ciqsteve: no. doing $(jqEl)  is redundant and wasteful
[06:23:58] <ciqsteve> shoky - ok tyvm
[06:24:27] <hagabaka> uh...
[06:24:30] <Hawkfire> any answer?
[06:24:39] <Hawkfire> nothing?
[06:24:58] <Hawkfire> havent got any idea anybody?
[06:25:44] <Hawkfire> nothing any idea anybody?
[06:26:06] <shoky> maybe if you ask the same thing a few more times
[06:27:24] <NoiseEee> Hawkfire: maybe try another plugin other than a 'simple' datepicker, or better yet, fork and make that feature happen!!!
[06:27:32] <Guesticles> Hawkfire: Set min and max times ("minTime":"hh:mm" and "maxTime":"hh:mm")
[06:28:10] <Hawkfire> well I have try that
[06:28:11] <NoiseEee> or as Guesticles did, read the page.
[06:28:16] <Hawkfire> but problem is this,
[06:28:29] <Guesticles> NoiseEee: ^^ This
[06:28:57] <Hawkfire> Consider multiple appointments have accepted the same day. it will be able to specify how.
[06:29:45] <Guesticles> Wat
[06:30:49] <Hawkfire> I wrote an asp script I am using jQuery datepicker. And the days were booked ineffective attibutes would prevent the election. But here's the real purpose of my available time during the day to identify and elect.
[06:32:18] <Hawkfire> For example, you want to book a date and time from a dentist. But dentist is busy on that day at 16:00- 16:30
[06:32:45] <MikeD_> i have a solution: don't use the date AND time feature
[06:32:45] <Hawkfire> you must not book that times.
[06:33:08] <MikeD_> use the date picker to then fire a lookup of available times... and present the choice in a plain old drop-down.
[06:33:31] <Hawkfire> ahha
[06:33:38] <Hawkfire> ok well idea
[06:33:41] <Hawkfire> I will try
[06:33:43] <Hawkfire> thanks all
[06:33:49] <Hawkfire> Thanks MikeD
[06:33:53] <MikeD_> yw
[06:34:26] <Hawkfire> Goodbye all...
[06:41:39] <rhinoboss> How can I set the select 2 by data index? Like if I want to programmatically choose a value? http://jsfiddle.net/xDUUg/1107/
[06:42:12] <rhinoboss> for example, I want to set it to the 2nd data index
[06:42:44] <Cork> rhinoboss: check what the plugin provides
[06:42:47] <maxvi> hi everyone! how can I disable any events on div? that div is placed over another div so I want to disable any events on this div or pass event to bottom div. how can I do that?
[06:43:53] <Cork> maxani: you can't
[06:44:01] <Cork> maxani: you have to bind all the events you want to stop
[06:44:10] <Cork> that said it shouldn't be too hard
[06:44:50] <Cork> $('div').on('keydown keyup input change', function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
[06:44:56] <Cork> should cover most cases
[06:46:36] <maxvi> Cork: I wan't stop propagation! I want the top div don't wait any events
[06:46:52] <Cork> maxani: uh
[06:46:55] <Cork> opps
[06:47:00] <Cork> *maxvi:
[06:47:15] <Cork> maxvi: then you are kinda out of luck
[06:47:29] <Cork> there is a css property you can set to kill of mouse events
[06:47:35] <Cork> but that's it
[06:47:42] <Cork> and it isn't cross browser
[06:48:02] <MikeD_> if you can't do something, you should ask yourself why... maybe there's another solution?
[06:48:13] <Cork> maxvi: your best option is to set a value and if it is something ignore the events
[06:48:46] <maxvi> Cork: may be create binds on all events (for the top div) and there call event for bottom div
[06:48:47] <decx> i dont get whats going on here, the top div has an event that should be ignored at certain circumstances`?
[06:49:09] <Cork> maxvi: that won't work
[06:49:19] <Cork> maxvi: it would kill ex. link clicks
[06:49:35] <maxvi> decx: the top div should be ignored always
[06:49:41] <Cork> decx: i think it is elm1 > elm2 > elm3 elm2 should not get events
[06:49:58] <Cork> maxvi: but why do you need this?
[06:50:54] <maxvi> Cork: top div has image with opacity and overlaps my div (bottom) with map
[06:51:09] <Cork> maxvi: ok?
[06:51:11] <Cork> and?
[06:51:25] <Cork> maxvi: just bind the event handler on a common parent
[06:51:33] <maxvi> and any events on map doesn't work
[06:51:34] <Cork> and use the bubbling events
[06:52:41] <NoiseEee> maxvi: of course they don't work, there's an element on top of the map
[06:53:09] <Cork> maxvi: the bubbling events is the only way to solve it cross browsers
[06:53:24] <Es0teric> why does jquery not recognize .pushStack() as a function? is it now .push() ?
[06:53:25] <decx> unless you want to target old browsers you can use pointer-events: none on the overlaying div
[06:54:09] <Cork> Es0teric: .pustStack isn't a js function
[06:54:24] <Es0teric> Cork: -> http://api.jquery.com/pushstack/
[06:54:25] <Cork> ?mdn pointer-events
[06:54:27] <b-ot> Cork: pointer-events - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[06:54:30] <Cork> maxvi: ^
[06:54:31] <maxvi> there is the code http://pastebin.com/uZiSNjDY
[06:54:45] <Cork> if your ok with not working in ie10 and down
[06:55:41] <onei> I'm having some issues with the string .text() returns http://jsfiddle.net/R7JDa/ most of the images here are lazy-loaded (see the data- attributes). If they are then .text() returns part of the img tag in the td tag, if not it doesn't. Does anyone know why?
[06:56:11] <Cork> Es0teric: never used it, but it looks like it should still be supported
[06:56:21] <Es0teric> Cork: my point
[06:56:22] <Cork> Es0teric: you could choose to use .add() instead
[06:56:28] <Es0teric> Cork: .add()
[06:56:28] <Es0teric> ?
[06:56:32] <Cork> yes
[06:56:43] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/add/
[06:57:00] <Es0teric> Cork: so add() works like push() ?
[06:57:05] <Cork> no
[06:57:09] <Cork> add works like addition
[06:57:20] <systemfault> push mutates‚Ä¶ add doesn't
[06:57:20] <Cork> variable = variable2.add(variable3)
[06:57:34] <Es0teric> i am looking to push to a var not add
[06:58:18] <NoiseEee> onei: i don't get what you're trying to do
[06:58:52] <onei> trying to understand why the img tag is included in the second string returned
[06:59:33] <onei> is it down to the number of attributes or the attributes used?
[06:59:42] <Cork> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/3LLug/ works fine here
[07:00:09] <Es0teric> Cork: i am trying to push json data
[07:00:12] <Es0teric> not div elements
[07:00:19] <Cork> Es0teric: then you don't want $() at all
[07:00:41] <Cork> Es0teric: you want to work with arrays and objects if you want to generate json
[07:00:47] <Cork> not jquery objects
[07:00:58] <Es0teric> Cork: i did arr = []; arr.pushStack(data);
[07:01:10] <Cork> Es0teric: arr is an array not a jquery object
[07:01:18] <Es0teric> clearly
[07:01:20] <Cork> and yes array uses push not pushStack
[07:02:35] <NoiseEee> onei: its probably confused by all the ridiculous inline JS and inline <noscript>(!?) stuff in the element
[07:03:02] <Es0teric> cork ok
[07:05:16] <Es0teric> Cork: ok just so i can know‚Ä¶ if i do something like arr = []; arr.push(data); it should be appending elements to the array right?
[07:05:25] <Cork> onei: <noscript> is still part of the dom
[07:05:33] <systemfault> Es0teric: yup
[07:05:33] <Cork> onei: even if they arn't rendered
[07:05:47] <Es0teric> systemfault: ok so the fact that this is not doing that is interesting
[07:05:50] <Cork> the dom .text() doesn't give you "visible" text
[07:05:57] <Cork> it gives you the text in the dom
[07:06:03] <Es0teric> but i am doing it in an ajax call‚Ä¶ so i suppose each ajax call is seperate
[07:06:18] <systemfault> .js var arr = []; arr.push(10); arr;
[07:06:21] <Cork> Es0teric: it should be appending the data you have in data
[07:06:25] <onei> ah, noscript makes sense. Thanks :)
[07:06:33] <Es0teric> Cork: yes but its in an ajax call
[07:06:34] <systemfault> !js 'lol'
[07:06:36] <Cork> Es0teric: if you plan to generate json it should most likely not be elements
[07:06:46] <Es0teric> i am not generating json i am retreving it
[07:06:57] <systemfault> Es0teric: You might have an asynchronicity issue unrelated to .push
[07:07:02] <Cork> Es0teric: then why are you pushing it to an array?
[07:07:16] <Es0teric> Cork: because i want to take that data and make divs
[07:07:44] <Cork> Es0teric: think your better of making a jsfiddle showing the code then
[07:08:02] <Es0teric> Cork: i do not have the time to make a fiddle..
[07:10:02] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: well if you can't explain your issue, good luck solving it.
[07:10:20] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: i will explain my issue in a minute, i am trying to solve something before this one
[07:10:41] <Es0teric> which is‚Ä¶ i have multiple divs with the same class, how do i append content after the last div?
[07:11:06] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: http://api.jquery.com/after/
[07:11:14] <NoiseEee> or http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[07:11:22] <uskerine> how can a "focusout" event be detected in datatables.net plugin?
[07:11:31] <Cork> Es0teric: you want to do that in one go though
[07:11:33] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: i get that but remember i have multiple divs with the same class‚Ä¶ i want to insert after the last one
[07:11:35] <motaka2> When I add two files that have two different eventhandlers for a single submit button, how I can make both events run ?
[07:11:43] <Cork> adding elements one at a time will kill your performance
[07:12:05] <Cork> motaka2: don't use return false; in the event handlers
[07:12:07] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: so isolate the last one (last()) and add it after it?
[07:12:17] <motaka2> Cork: I didnt
[07:12:31] <MikeD_> isn't insertAfter the last one a normal append() ?
[07:12:32] <Cork> motaka2: then it should work, as long as the selectors find the target element
[07:12:45] <Cork> MikeD_: only if the "last one" is the last child of the parent
[07:12:54] <MikeD_> oh yeah, sorry
[07:13:15] <motaka2> It doesnt just the foirstone executes. I want to first run the second one and then the first one actually
[07:13:55] <Cork> motaka2: the order they run depends on when the code in them run
[07:13:56] <Guesticles> with jquery.validator.addmethod, if I don't want the message to display directly after the field that is being validated, what would be the best way to display the messages?
[07:14:19] <Cork> but unless the first one aborts the event queue they should both work; as long as they both bind to the element
[07:15:01] <motaka2> I want when clicking on a submit button first the eventhandler in second file run for that submit button and the handle for the first one
[07:15:24] <dawei3452> Hello, I'm trying to get the data from my tabled stored in a js element. I am not getting any errors in console.log or on online validators. If anyone would be so kind as to take a look and tell me where I might be going wrong that would be much appreciated :) http://jsbin.com/makinone/1/edit
[07:15:28] <Cork> motaka2: then the second file would have to be the one setting the event handler for the first one
[07:15:35] <Cork> after it has added its own
[07:15:52] <Cork> or you would have to fire the function for the first one from the second one
[07:17:00] <VectorX> http://jsfiddle.net/2Lsj3/ with this code, how do i check if the index exits proper since it is there ?
[07:17:24] <motaka2> Cork: any other way?? like when document is loaded I change the order or something?
[07:17:37] <Cork> motaka2: nope
[07:17:49] <Cork> change order means remove all events and add them in the "correct" order
[07:17:58] <Cork> there is no way to reordering events in dom
[07:18:19] <systemfault> VectorX: For some weird reason, I can't load your url‚Ä¶ JSfiddle is initializing forever. Can you check if you have the same issue.
[07:18:22] <Cork> VectorX: sigh... don't use document.write...
[07:18:33] <Cork> it blows away the document...
[07:18:39] <BillCriswell> I'm laughing and cursing at IE calling it an asshole walking back and forth from this kiosk. I feel like a crazy person.
[07:18:49] <VectorX> systemfault yeah same but if i hit run it works
[07:18:54] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: ah .last() didnt know about that thanks
[07:18:55] <VectorX> i want to check if the data array has a region that has "New York" in it
[07:19:41] <VectorX> http://jsfiddle.net/2Lsj3/1/
[07:19:44] <Cork> VectorX, systematik fixed version http://jsfiddle.net/89MMR/
[07:20:15] <Cork> VectorX: you can't use indexOf for an array of objects
[07:20:23] <Cork> you have to loop the array
[07:20:34] <VectorX> ic
[07:21:39] <Cork> VectorX: if you normally use document.write, please move out of the 90's and use the modern development tools
[07:23:09] <VectorX> Cork using the dynamic debugger of phpstorm so none of that is passed to it
[07:23:39] <Cork> VectorX: well document.write and alert will give you false results
[07:23:54] <Cork> especially document.write...
[07:24:11] <VectorX> true
[07:24:20] <VectorX> although ill keep that inmind for jsfiddle
[07:27:16] <dawei3452> Anyone at all had time to take a look why this may not be working? :) http://jsbin.com/makinone/1/edit
[07:28:00] <Cork> dawei3452: define not working
[07:29:21] <dawei3452> Cork: It's not sucessfully storing the elements from my table. I want to store them so I can view in console.log but all that gets output is : []
[07:30:04] <Cork> dawei3452: well you don't have any elements :)
[07:30:11] <Cork> but this MIGHT be what your after http://jsbin.com/makinone/2/edit
[07:30:19] <Cork> if it isn't fix the demo
[07:30:36] <dawei3452> Ahh i forgot my html how silly of me
[07:30:46] <dawei3452> Cork: Thanks i'll try that and if not update the jsbin with htmlk
[07:31:47] <BillCriswell> Who needs HTML anyway.
[07:32:37] <decx> why 10 separate find() ?
[07:32:59] <decx> get one children(), cache and then get the right one with eq(n)
[07:37:14] <BillCriswell> Looking at code from a few months ago... you all know how that goes.
[07:37:21] <BillCriswell> I wonder if that ever stops happening.
[07:39:18] <Drewberto> Can anyone help me figure out why my variables inside my function are showing as undefined
[07:39:20] <Drewberto> http://jsfiddle.net/Garmageddon/4pbXu/2/
[07:40:03] <decx> "this sounds interesting" *clicks fiddle* Drupal.behaviors.my_custom_behavior "nope"
[07:40:59] <systemfault> lol
[07:41:08] <Garmageddon> jquery in druapl is making me want to slam my head into the wall
[07:41:08] <Cork> drewdrewdrew: what line?
[07:41:14] <systemfault> The guy wanted help‚Ä¶ waits one minute then leave
[07:41:19] <Garmageddon> i'm here
[07:41:27] <Garmageddon> Drewberto <<<
[07:41:35] <BillCriswell> I cry whenever I see "Drupal" and I'm totally comfortable admitting that it's probably just because I don't understand it.
[07:41:53] <BillCriswell> don't understand it well*
[07:42:27] <Cork> drewdrewdrew: var $this = this instanceof jQuery ? this: $( this ); <-- this line isn't needed
[07:42:33] <Cork> jsut do var $this = $(this)
[07:42:40] <Garmageddon> ok
[07:42:50] <Cork> $() will only wrap it again if it isn't already a jquery object
[07:42:56] <Cork> no need to do the checking twice :)
[07:43:11] <Cork> opps
[07:43:36] <Cork> ah
[07:43:38] <Cork> nick change >_<
[07:43:43] <Es0teric> how do i append before an element?
[07:43:56] <Cork> Garmageddon: please don't change nick right after asking a question
[07:43:58] <BillCriswell> prepend.
[07:44:12] <Cork> it becomes quite weird to answer :)
[07:44:19] <decx> actually it's before()
[07:44:23] <Cork> ya
[07:44:31] <Garmageddon> Cork: I just realized I must have relogged and it changed names on me
[07:44:33] <Cork> prepend adds to the beginning of the element
[07:44:45] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I was trying to translate a bit.
[07:44:50] <BillCriswell> decx: *
[07:45:36] <Cork> Garmageddon: but again, what line is the undefined variable problem on?
[07:45:49] <decx> you'r out of your element donny !
[07:46:18] <BillCriswell> decx: DOM jokes.
[07:46:43] <Es0teric> decx: .before() moves the element i want to append to the top
[07:46:46] <dawei3452> Cork: Here is the jsbin with some added html table data template http://jsbin.com/makinone/3/edit
[07:46:50] <BillCriswell> decx: HAAAAA
[07:46:54] <Garmageddon> Cork: Any clue why my variables would be show up undefined?
[07:46:57] <BillCriswell> <-- Mind reader.
[07:47:00] <decx> clever, as before() is out and prepend() is inside an element
[07:47:08] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: =_=
[07:47:13] <Cork> Garmageddon: not until you answer the question...
[07:47:46] <Garmageddon> Cork: Sorry must have missed it
[07:48:13] <Cork> dawei3452: well the code works
[07:48:26] <Es0teric> ok so i have something like $(‚Äò‚Äô.someclass‚Äù).append($(‚Äò‚Äô<div/>‚Äô, {class: ‚ÄúsomeNewClass‚Äù}));
[07:48:33] <Es0teric> but i want to append before an element
[07:48:33] <Cork> though ya you prob want to do the caching ... decx(?) talked about
[07:48:57] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: .prepend()
[07:49:03] <Garmageddon> Cork: Line 24 - orginalUrl, tempUrl, and url all show up undefined if I try to log them to console
[07:49:48] <dawei3452> Cork: Yeah as in the table displays, but the data isn't being stored in the js array :(
[07:50:18] <Cork> dawei3452: the console shows it at least
[07:50:30] <Es0teric> ok ok BillCriswell i get it now
[07:50:34] <Es0teric> thanks
[07:50:39] <dawei3452> Cork: Really!? I can't get it to show, 2 secs
[07:51:36] <Cork> dawei3452: http://jsbin.com/makinone/4/edit
[07:52:41] <dawei3452> Cork: for me all it shows in Console area is [] I'm looking for it to show the td information in an array there
[07:52:50] <dawei3452> Cork: Thanks for helping btw, much appreciated
[07:54:04] <Cork> dawei3452: reload
[07:54:57] <Cork> hmm i see another thing i would fix
[07:55:24] <dawei3452> Cork: Thanks that looks much better now!. What is it? :)
[07:55:36] <Cork> dawei3452: give me a few mins
[07:55:55] <dawei3452> Cork: Absolutely :)
[08:01:18] <Cork> dawei3452: http://jsbin.com/makinone/4/edit
[08:01:26] <Cork> slight code reduction :)
[08:03:08] <uskerine> how could I get HIDDEN columns values in datatables?, I am currently using: var rows = $('#fooTable').dataTable().fnGetNodes(); and then reference:      rows[i].cells[0].firstChild.value,
[08:03:15] <uskerine> but index for cells only uses VISIBLE ones
[08:04:03] <dawei3452> Cork: Fantastic, thank you for all your help :)
[08:04:10] <Cork> np :)
[08:04:35] <Garmageddon> Cork: I'm an idiot and figured it out! Thanks!
[08:05:06] <Cork> Garmageddon: if you figured out your problem you're not an idiot ^^
[08:05:49] <Garmageddon> Cork: scope issue, trying to access variables in a function - I haven't touched javascript in way to long
[08:06:01] <Cork> :)
[08:19:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know how in an isotope sort function, the sortdata can be recalculated? For example I arrange the elements by timestamp. But the timestamp can change. Problem is that it uses the old timestaps and sorts wrong in this case. Any way around this?
[08:26:05] <uskerine> how do I get SER001 from      <input name="reference" value="SER001"></input> ?
[08:26:19] <drej> you dont need </input>
[08:26:20] <uskerine> <input name="reference" value="SER001"></input> is returned by table.row(i).data()[0]
[08:26:22] <drej> an input is a self closing tag
[08:26:40] <drej> $('input[value="SER001"]')
[08:26:42] <BillCriswell> uskerine: What did you try?
[08:26:50] <drej> oh i gave it away, sorry bill
[08:26:52] <uskerine> I am trying to get all values from a datatables
[08:27:02] <uskerine> even the hidden ones
[08:27:16] <BillCriswell> drej: Haha, all good.
[08:27:46] <BillCriswell> Not sure it's what they were shooting for though.
[08:27:55] <uskerine> so if I do table.row(i).data()[0] I get first cell
[08:27:59] <uskerine> of the row 'i'
[08:28:10] <uskerine> that returns html <input name="reference" value="SER001"></input>
[08:28:16] <uskerine> from that I would like to get just SER001
[08:28:31] <BillCriswell> uskerine: It seems like there should be an easier way to do that.
[08:28:33] <uskerine> -i duly noted  the comment that <input should be closed>
[08:28:35] <drej> .attr('value');
[08:28:37] <drej> or just .val()
[08:28:51] <drej> uskerine should NOT be closed.
[08:28:53] <BillCriswell> uskerine: $(table.row(i).data()[0]).val() would return the value, but something seems fucky.
[08:29:17] <uskerine> why fucky?
[08:29:29] <uskerine> drej, duly noted that it should not be closed
[08:29:48] <drej> :)
[08:29:50] <BillCriswell> uskerine: It just doesn't feel right. I could be wrong.
[08:30:00] <uskerine> <input name="reference" value=""/>'
[08:30:15] <uskerine> I will try
[08:30:19] <BillCriswell> Don't even need the /.
[08:30:24] <uskerine> ok
[08:30:30] <BillCriswell> <input name="reference" value="2"> is plenty.
[08:30:41] <BillCriswell> Unless you're using like XHTML or something.
[08:30:44] <uskerine> same for textarea?
[08:30:49] <BillCriswell> uskerine: No.
[08:30:56] <uskerine>   '<textarea name="description" value="" rows="1"></textarea>'
[08:30:59] <uskerine> so that's right
[08:31:00] <uskerine> ø?
[08:31:02] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:31:04] <uskerine> thanks
[08:31:09] <BillCriswell> Well, no value.
[08:31:15] <BillCriswell> The value is what's inside the element.
[08:32:03] <drej> <textarea name="" id=""> value is here </textarea>
[08:32:39] <uskerine> $(table.row(i).data()[0]).val()
[08:32:43] <uskerine> that works fine , thanks a lot
[08:32:49] <uskerine> I will check for the textarea
[08:32:53] <uskerine> what should I do in that case?
[08:33:05] <drej> same thing
[08:33:36] <decx> is there any benefit apart from fewer strokes to short-circuit evaluation in js?
[08:33:42] <plagins_> hey, i know this is not the right way to look for answers but i have no idea how to create something alike in jsfiddle so ... having some trouble with a plugin some may uses. its name is jQueryCustomContentScroller. my problem is that i can use the mCustomScrollbar function without arguments, but once i set arguments (like theme:rounded), the scrollbar doesnt display anymore ( my script : http://puu.sh/9I7PN/5a0b31851b.png )
[08:34:01] <plagins_> and the website's link is http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/
[08:34:02] <uskerine> drej, .val() does not work for textarea
[08:34:43] <uskerine> table.row(i).data()[1]       ->   <textarea name="description" rows="1">fooline1 fooline2 fooline3</textarea>
[08:34:45] <decx> sure it does
[08:35:02] <uskerine> oops
[08:35:03] <uskerine> it does
[08:35:09] <uskerine> i think i did not saved the .js
[08:35:10] <uskerine> :)
[08:35:14] <uskerine> thanks
[08:35:28] <decx> whammy
[08:35:58] <uskerine> billcriswell, why do you think this is "fucky"  $(table.row(i).data()[0]).val()
[08:36:03] <uskerine> ?
[08:36:09] <uskerine> should it be coded in different way?
[08:36:17] <decx> just look at it
[08:36:27] <uskerine> var table = $('#fooTable').DataTable();
[08:39:01] <wunz> whats the diff bwt "this" and "$(this)" ?
[08:39:15] <drej> one's a jquery object, one's just an element
[08:39:16] <drej> iirc
[08:39:18] <drej> but i could be wrong
[08:39:20] <drej> i dont know much of anything
[08:39:30] <decx> this is this and $(this) is this in a wrapper
[08:39:33] <wunz> lol that's why we're here :)
[08:39:55] <wunz> decx: is there a diff in using it?
[08:40:04] <decx> depends on what this is
[08:40:27] <decx> in each() this would be the native element and as such wouldnt work with jquery methods
[08:40:47] <wunz> i'm doing a ("li > a.selected").each(function() { console.log(this.attr("href")) };
[08:41:11] <decx> attr() is a jquery function
[08:41:19] <decx> this is a normal element
[08:41:29] <decx> lucky you href is straight forward so you can do this.href
[08:41:30] <wunz> from the example on jq: http://api.jquery.com/each/ -- top one uses $(this) and bottom one uses this
[08:43:30] <mintmoney> anyone know have/ know where I can find a JQuery shield icon (similar to the HTML5/CSS3 style icons)??
[08:43:49] <wunz> thanks decx
[08:44:01] <decx> a shield icon?
[08:44:21] <drej> iconfinder ?
[08:44:26] <drej> there are icons specific to jquery now?
[08:44:27] <mintmoney> decx: yes
[08:44:46] <mintmoney> something to go with this set: http://binarybusinesssolutions.com/images/appdev.png
[08:45:06] <drej> those "shield icons" mean something...
[08:45:09] <decx> ah, the new w3c valid icon
[08:45:09] <drej> they're official spec
[08:45:12] <decx> ... ^^
[08:45:20] <drej> where as jquery is its own product and not w3c
[08:45:24] <drej> so ... you wont find one
[08:45:33] <mintmoney> i would think someone would have made one though...
[08:45:47] <mintmoney> i get it's not normal.. just would be nice
[08:46:12] <mintmoney> like angular.js has one
[08:46:52] <drej> i mean ... that's like saying "i want a BMW logo that looks like the mercedes one"
[08:55:47] <decx> i guess it would look like this: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/n6X3X/
[08:56:05] <systemfault> Ew.
[08:56:10] <systemfault> That damn dollar sign.
[08:56:15] <decx> hehe
[08:57:33] <tmac> hi
[08:58:04] <tmac> can i propagate a element event to elements loaded via ajax?
[08:58:24] <tmac> im trying with .on but doesn't working
[08:58:52] <decx> delegate before you generate
[08:59:29] <tmac> that i do
[08:59:56] <tmac> but nothing
[08:59:56] <decx> fiddle up
[09:00:17] <MikeD_> does it matter if you load content before or after the assignment of the event listener?
[09:00:47] <tmac> im loading the new content after event assignment
[09:01:07] <MikeD_> "delegate before you generate" is certainly catchy, but don't events bubble either way?
[09:01:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How to exclude an item from sorting in Isotope?
[09:01:10] <motaka2> Where should we attach events that are just relevant to selectors of a plugin? inside the body of the plugin or outside of it ?
[09:01:27] <vladikoff> tmac, http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:01:44] <vladikoff> tmac, see text starting with the bold part
[09:03:00] <tmac> wait first pastebin.com
[09:03:01] <tmac> ok?
[09:03:37] <tmac> ah
[09:03:38] <tmac> ok
[09:03:55] <tmac> it do work now
[09:03:56] <tmac> :D
[09:05:03] <tmac> but i dont know why i have used $(document).('click.element', function)
[09:05:27] <tmac> and i cant use $(element).on(event, function)
[09:08:12] <duch_kazatel> good morning folks.
[09:08:13] <decx> your script executes at page load, at that time $(element) only contains the elements that actually exist at that point
[09:08:27] <vladikoff> tmac, did you read my link?
[09:08:35] <shoky> MikeD_: it doesn't matter when you load content, it matters when the event is triggered
[09:08:52] <tmac> [vladikoff] im reading
[09:09:03] <tmac> thanks guys
[09:09:26] <decx> hey duch_kazatel
[09:09:41] <Xliff> \o
[09:09:51] <Es0teric> if i move something using jquery ui draggable, how do i find the index of it? because when i move something i want it to move the position of the element on another location in the page
[09:09:52] <Xliff> Don't ask me why I am awake. I just... am.
[09:10:04] <decx> hey Xliff, did you convince anyone to use headdesk yet?
[09:10:17] <Xliff> decx: Not for lack of trying. :P
[09:10:43] <decx> ha
[09:10:52] <shoky> Es0teric: you can find an element's index with .index()
[09:11:07] <Xliff> Es0teric: Can you fiddle up an example?
[09:11:17] <Es0teric> Xliff: i would but i do not have the time
[09:11:26] <Xliff> :/
[09:12:18] <Xliff> Es0teric: Then I don't understand what you are looking for.
[09:12:41] <Xliff> If you move a DIV around on screen, why are you looking for its index?
[09:12:55] <Xliff> You aren't really moving things around in the DOM.
[09:13:23] <Xliff> So confusion abounds. Please explain further. (Really, you'd waste less time with the fiddle.)
[09:14:08] <Es0teric> Xliff heres the scenario, i have a div that has an ID {postID} in its json and its passed in to the element in some form‚Ä¶ i have an associated element  that has an ID something like <a id=‚Äú{postID}‚Äù></a>
[09:15:05] <Es0teric> but the point is that the ID can be called as such‚Ä¶ i am looking to move the draggable element that is the initial element up, and to move the element that contains the #{postID} up as well
[09:15:58] <decx> wat
[09:16:00] <shoky> ^
[09:16:05] <Xliff> But the DIV's id and the ELEMENT's id are different, correct?
[09:16:26] <Xliff> Es0teric: It's still a bit confusing.
[09:16:50] <Es0teric> Xliff: the div doesnt have an id, it has a class
[09:16:51] <MikeD_> you really should have just fiddled two lists
[09:17:01] <Xliff> ^
[09:17:25] <Es0teric> no time
[09:17:32] <Xliff> And what do you mean by "move up"?
[09:17:33] <shoky> then ask later
[09:17:37] <decx> you didnt have time to make a fiddle for a different problem yesterday as well. step up that fiddle game yo
[09:17:41] <MikeD_> it sounds like you want to reorder a nav (or somesuch) and have the content order of some other collection to be modified
[09:17:43] <shoky> when you have time to actually get help
[09:18:15] <MikeD_> but say "id" and other "id" a few more times to make it clear :)
[09:18:27] <Xliff> Seriously. In the time it has taken to post that description, you could have fiddled and gotten better answers.
[09:19:12] <Es0teric> MikeD_: yes
[09:19:13] <MikeD_> are you dynamically generating the related items?
[09:20:17] <Es0teric> MikeD_ i am partially dynamically generating them
[09:20:27] <BillCriswell> Oh boy.
[09:21:22] <MikeD_> i don't understand what problem you are having, other than communicating what you are trying to accomplish.
[09:21:34] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell++
[09:23:25] <BillCriswell> I feel like death.
[09:23:42] <BillCriswell> but it's the end of June. It doesn't make sense.
[09:24:08] <MikeD_> "feel like death" and "end of June"  sounds ominous for her, doesn't it?
[09:24:11] <Jattenalle> Es0teric, element.id knock yourself out
[09:24:53] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: A lady named June?
[09:25:08] <MikeD_> heh, yeah.
[09:25:47] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I really wasn't sure what you meant haha
[09:26:04] <BillCriswell> Rarely the fastest runner in the race.
[09:26:10] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: you've done a pretty crap job explaining your situation yet still demanding help after 2+ hours
[09:26:49] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee it‚Äôs Es0teric.  they‚Äôre in here all the time with stuff like that.
[09:27:08] <NoiseEee> true that
[09:27:08] <shoky> no time. no time. hodor
[09:27:39] <Es0teric> lol NoiseEee
[09:27:41] <Jattenalle> at least he's got an eye for it
[09:27:45] <Jattenalle> and didnt lose his.. head
[09:27:51] <Jattenalle> i dont know... i dont watch GoT
[09:28:06] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: They DID open up with B.O.B.
[09:28:11] <Xliff> Jattenalle: What? Was that supposed to be a Highlander reference?
[09:28:22] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: nice!! was it awesome/
[09:28:41] <Jattenalle> Xliff, the recent GoT episode where mediterranean guy got his eyes gouged out and head smashed
[09:28:43] <Xliff> Oh! GoT... nevermind.
[09:28:52] <Xliff> I don't watch GoT.
[09:29:02] <BillCriswell> Yeah. They were the only ones I really cared to see and it was worth it.
[09:29:09] <Xliff> But thanks for the explanation.
[09:29:13] <BillCriswell> He had a "children of the cornbread" shirt on that I want now.
[09:29:18] <nhulea> dude I watched the first and last episode
[09:29:22] <nhulea> last nite
[09:30:08] <nhulea> brandon stark was on track to be a gymnast before he went for the dive watching the incest haha
[09:31:56] <Jattenalle> i recently learned that the actor playing the mountain
[09:31:59] <Jattenalle> the new actor that is
[09:32:02] <Jattenalle> is only 26 years old
[09:32:04] <Jattenalle> madness
[09:32:34] <Xliff> That's not an unusual age..
[09:32:45] <shoky> he's in those "strongest man in the world" competitions
[09:32:54] <shoky> chugging trucks and whatnot
[09:32:59] <Jattenalle> Xliff, http://cbssports.com/images/blogs/Hafthor_Bjornsson_Mountain_Game_Of_Thrones_Colts_Picture.png
[09:33:04] <Jattenalle> in case you dont know what he looks like
[09:33:20] <Xliff> Makeup.
[09:33:33] <Xliff> It can do anything.
[09:33:51] <Jattenalle> https://www.blastr.com/sites/blastr/files/styles/blog_post_in_content_image/public/NewGregor.jpg?itok=7zXsiloX nope, that's what he actually looks like
[09:34:03] <Jattenalle> there's even a documentary he's in
[09:34:08] <Jattenalle> giants of iceland or somesuch
[09:34:20] <Jattenalle> supposedly he's not likely to live to 50
[09:34:31] <BillCriswell> That sucks.
[09:34:36] <decx> his organs are the same size as anyone elses
[09:34:45] <Jattenalle> exactly, they cant keep up
[09:35:31] <BillCriswell> Would it be a good thing to try and stay in shape in that case?
[09:35:53] <Jattenalle> not for him i suppose, since more shape = more body mass = more strain
[09:36:05] * Jattenalle shrugs
[09:36:14] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Haha same way I'm thinking.
[09:36:20] <Xliff> Well, he's so in shape, that he's out!
[09:36:41] <Xliff> That's like being so crazy you wrap around to being sane!
[09:36:43] <BillCriswell> Xliff: Exactly. Wonder if he should just hang out at home and play some nintendo.
[09:36:44] <Jattenalle> buzzfeed link, so prepare for stupid ads, but http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/omg-the-mountain-from-game-of-thrones-is-only-25
[09:37:01] <Xliff> BillCriswell: LOL
[09:37:27] <BillCriswell> Damn. That's rough.
[09:38:34] <BillCriswell> Well, hopefully in the future we'll get some sweet organs that'll let him live longer.
[09:38:38] <nhulea> Jattenalle: think of all the guys in the nfl they are all under 30 basically and most under 25
[09:38:58] <Jattenalle> never heard of this enn eff ell
[09:39:06] <Jattenalle> is that some sort of sportsball?
[09:39:16] <nhulea> heyy watch it now
[09:39:20] <BillCriswell> It's American "football".
[09:39:20] <nhulea> !g nfl
[09:39:22] <b-ot> nhulea: NFL.com - Official Site of the National Football League ‚Üí http://www.nfl.com/
[09:39:32] <BillCriswell> Why it's called football I have no idea.
[09:39:34] <Jattenalle> also im more impressed with the mountains physique, since it's actual core strength.. not 45 minute sprint bullshit
[09:39:57] <Jattenalle> handegg, go team go! do the thing, get the points! plastic armor is manly! wooo! :D
[09:39:58] <BillCriswell> Yeah he definitely works on it haha.
[09:40:01] <nhulea> BillCriswell: well it dates back to the gridiron on the frozen tundra
[09:40:27] <nhulea> wait handegg is that from 4chan
[09:40:31] <BillCriswell> I starting working out recently. It does feel good after it's all over haha
[09:40:32] <nhulea> ?
[09:40:43] <nhulea> hell go BillCriswell !
[09:40:45] <Jattenalle> nhulea, well it's an egg shaped ball, that you play with your hands...
[09:40:57] <Jattenalle> nhulea, it does make more sense

[09:41:33] <drej> yup

[09:45:59] <BillCriswell> pedda: I think he's just suggesting using .off() ?

[09:46:35] <bowenac> anyone know how to resize an iframe based on the inner content?
[09:46:37] <BillCriswell> pedda: No problem.
[09:46:47] <bowenac> not on the same domain
[09:47:26] <Jattenalle> bowenac, set its width to scrollwidth?
[09:47:49] <bowenac> height?
[09:47:58] <bowenac> just setting width to 100%
[09:48:00] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Hm, never thought to try scrollHeight on an iframe.
[09:48:08] <Jattenalle> bowenac, set its height to scrollheight
[09:48:17] <Jattenalle> i dont know if it'll work, but hey, worth a try ;)
[09:48:38] <Jattenalle> iframes are special beasts.. so it might not work as expected..
[09:48:55] <BillCriswell> bowenac: There's a "seamless" attribute currently being considered... I think.
[09:49:07] <BillCriswell> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe mentioned here
[09:49:24] <tw2113> iframes are such a painus
[09:49:33] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Indeed.
[09:49:43] <Xliff> tw2113: In the assus.
[09:51:55] <BillCriswell> No one seems to like seamless.
[09:52:10] <Jattenalle> it's a silly hac
[09:52:11] <BillCriswell> seamless	Not supported	Not supported	Not supported	Not supported	
[09:53:10] <decx> never heard of it
[09:54:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Seamless awareness month is NEXT month.
[09:55:11] <uskerine> I am trying to POST a JSON object, If I see "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" in the Firebug POST information, does it mean that my Jquery is not posting a JSON object?
[09:55:39] <bowenac> anyone have an example of that doesnt seem to be working
[09:56:43] <shoky> uskerine: probably yeah. though you can also send a json string as one of the regular POST params
[09:56:56] <bowenac> object.scrollHeight+"px";
[09:57:08] <bowenac> and set the object to the id of the iframe would that not work onready
[09:57:51] <shoky> bowenac i don't think you can access the iframe's contents. and i don't see how getting the iframe's scrollHeight would help
[09:59:23] <bowenac> shoky I thought you would then be able to use the scrollheight value as the height value
[09:59:45] <shoky> i don't think the scrollHeight would be bigger than the height
[10:00:13] <bowenac> wouldnt it be bigger than no height at all?
[10:01:53] <shoky> bowenac: it would be the same as its height i think
[10:09:45] <motaka2> hello I have attached two submit event handlers in two diffrent files . but I need the one apeared in the second file first. What should I do ?
[10:10:12] <duch_kazatel> don‚Äôt attach two :)
[10:12:12] <uskerine> var data = {invoiceItems: []};
[10:12:31] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: one is relevant to submitting a form in ajax. so it makes the navigation in ajax possible. the second one is like an auto suggest for a form field. so I have to have too. Is there a way to change order of events ?
[10:12:32] <uskerine> if I do data.toSource() I get:   ({invoiceItems:[.....]})
[10:12:38] <uskerine> why the ( ) ?
[10:12:42] <uskerine> should I do something different?
[10:13:09] <uskerine> -I am trying to build a properly formed JSON-
[10:13:12] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 don‚Äôt bing two separate handlers for that.  bind one and put all your logic in there.
[10:14:19] <shoky> uskerine: huh why are you using .toSource()  didn't even know that exists. (in FF only)
[10:14:21] <motaka2> I simply understand this solution but teh code in second one is rarely needed. and it also binded in a plugin to the selected members to that plugin
[10:14:55] <shoky> uskerine: JSON.stringify( obj )  to make a proper JSON string out of an object
[10:14:59] <uskerine> I just want to debug what I am sending
[10:15:19] <shoky> and if you want your whole request body to be json,
[10:15:28] <shoky> then use  contentType: 'application/json'
[10:15:37] <shoky> and set data to the json string
[10:15:46] <shoky> your server needs to know what to do with that
[10:15:49] <uskerine> I will try that stringify
[10:16:37] <shoky> another option is to keep it as regular post data and just set one property to a json string, e.g.:   data: { myjson: JSON.stringify(obj), ... }
[10:17:08] <uskerine> now I can see in firebug a proper JSON object
[10:17:09] <uskerine> thanks
[10:17:26] <uskerine> contentType: 'application/json'
[10:17:26] <uskerine>             dataType: 'json',
[10:17:26] <uskerine>             
[10:17:30] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 none of that is going to change my advice - don‚Äôt bind two listeners.  bind one and control your logic from there.
[10:17:34] <uskerine> what is the difference between contentType and dataType?
[10:17:58] <shoky> uskerine: contentType sets the request content-type header.  dataType is what jquery will expect back from the server
[10:18:06] <uskerine> understood
[10:18:10] <shoky> so dataType: 'json'   means it will parse the response as json
[10:18:11] <uskerine> so if I am sending just a JSON object
[10:18:20] <uskerine> I should include contentType
[10:18:21] <uskerine> right?
[10:18:28] <shoky> yeah
[10:18:35] <uskerine> understood. Thanks a lot
[10:25:05] <motaka2> using this script how can I make the second submit event start before the first ?
[10:25:28] <motaka2> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6b57378fb9a0414a5c3c
[10:27:14] <Xliff> motoka2: I agree with duch_kazatel. Don't use 2 events. Use one.
[10:28:15] <motaka2> I cant. it's a library cant change. I have to add my own submit event
[10:29:36] <Xliff> motaka2: Do you use this library for anything else?
[10:30:53] <motaka2> Xliff: yes plus that submit event in the second file is activated once upon each 1000 requests. why should I add it to the first file ?
[10:32:14] <Xliff> motaka2: Do you have a fiddle or a web page where I can see this in action?
[10:34:15] <Xliff> *le-sigh*
[10:38:38] <fission6> how would i select all first columns in a table, and idealy print them out (in th eocnsole)
[10:42:02] <duch_kazatel> look through each <tr>, get the first td on each, and console.log() it?
[10:42:10] <duch_kazatel> s/look/loo
[10:42:14] <duch_kazatel> fff i give up.
[10:42:49] <shoky> lol
[10:43:02] <duch_kazatel> this mootools deprecation will be the end of me.
[10:44:08] <BillCriswell> for fucks what?
[10:44:31] <Cyclohexane> What's the equivalent of .autocomplete("url"); ? e.g. .autocomplete({some_option: "url"}); ?
[10:44:32] <duch_kazatel> i prononce that more as ‚Äúefffff‚Äù
[10:44:36] <Cyclohexane> in jquery-ui
[10:45:41] <motaka2> what is the best way to make all requests whether clicking a link or submiting a form to ajax ?
[10:47:23] <duch_kazatel> wut
[10:47:56] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: can you please tell me how I can integrate those two submits in one ?
[10:48:18] <duch_kazatel> you all ready know what i‚Äôm going to tell you :)
[10:48:26] <Xliff> <fiddle>
[10:49:05] <duch_kazatel> also: whoever on the mootools team though that .test() was a good thing to add to the string prototype is a jerk
[10:49:11] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: bo this time I ma thinking of integrating both in one. but I dont know how
[10:49:13] <Xliff> LOL
[10:49:25] <drej> holy shit mootools
[10:49:29] <drej> thats a word i havent seen in like 5 years
[10:49:36] <duch_kazatel> yeah we‚Äôre deprecating it out of our frontend right now.
[10:49:40] <systemfault> What about prototype.js? :P
[10:49:54] <duch_kazatel> i started the project because it‚Äôs a joke.  and I‚Äôve used prototype.js before, too.  not here though.
[10:50:03] <Xliff> Ouch. I was working in prototype a year ago. :P
[10:50:07] <duch_kazatel> D:
[10:50:15] <duch_kazatel> i‚Äôd use yui before either of those.
[10:50:22] <Xliff> Legacy project.
[10:50:29] <systemfault> YUI 3 is not bad at all.
[10:50:35] <systemfault> 2 was ‚Ä¶. eww
[10:50:41] <Xliff> To make it worse, it was prototype.js + ColdFusion.
[10:50:42] <motaka2> yui is bad by all means
[10:50:59] <duch_kazatel> Xliff my company uses coldfusion still./.
[10:51:05] <systemfault> Oh shit.
[10:51:13] <duch_kazatel> we‚Äôre looking at moving off.
[10:51:31] <Xliff> Don't you LOVE the word "legacy"?
[10:51:53] <duch_kazatel> sadly none of this is considered legacy codebase.  it‚Äôs in active use.
[10:52:13] <uskerine> Does anyone know how to detect focusout from an input element stored in a cell of a datatables table?
[10:52:17] <motaka2> so no solution for me?
[10:52:21] <Xliff> My project was the same. Maybe using "legacy" was bad form.
[10:52:48] <Xliff> How about: code so long in the tooth that hasn't been nearly refactored enough?
[10:53:08] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 i don‚Äôt understand what the question is - you know how you bind a listener already.  binding a listener that does two things isn‚Äôt any harder.
[10:53:16] <Xliff> motaka2: Where is the fiddle which describes your problem?
[10:53:34] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: He wants to reorder the binding.
[10:53:41] <Xliff> Oh. Wait. You know this. Nevermind.
[10:54:07] <Fraz> hi
[10:54:10] <motaka2> Xliff: So is there a way ?
[10:54:12] <duch_kazatel> yep.  and my entire point to him is to dump the separate bindings
[10:54:32] <Xliff> Yeah. The problem there is that the bindings are part of a library he uses.
[10:55:15] <Xliff> motoka2: To be honest, my best solution for you would be to drop the submit bindings and then bind your own custom function (SINGLE HANDLER) that does what you want.
[10:55:27] <Xliff> You can then cut and paste the code in the order you want it executed.
[10:55:38] <Xliff> I'd still like to see an example, so I can play with it.
[10:55:41] <duch_kazatel> waht‚Äôs the library?
[10:55:46] <Xliff> Without that, all I can give you is the guesswork.
[10:56:03] <Fraz> if i use translate in jquery animate will it fall back to using left and top if the browser doesnt support css3?
[10:57:41] <shoky> you can't use translate in jquery animate
[10:58:01] <Fraz> oh, hmmm
[10:58:15] <motaka2> Xliff: lemme try my best to give you an example. since it hase connections to databse it doesnt work on fiddle
[10:58:25] <Fraz> cos im using transit, and it says to use the same properties in animate for js fallback
[10:58:42] <shoky> that's not jquery
[10:59:11] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 then come up with a smaller use case.
[10:59:13] <Fraz> shoky, are you seriously gonna nitpick like that?
[10:59:29] <shoky> like what?
[10:59:46] <Fraz> <shoky> that's not jquery
[10:59:55] <shoky> how is that nitpicking
[11:00:25] <shoky> you're using some library, so the rules for using jquery's animate don't really apply
[11:00:26] <Fraz> because transit is built with jquery
[11:00:27] <adavia> quick question from beginner why $(this) is not toggling the selected element here http://jsfiddle.net/V4ezd/
[11:00:30] <shoky> so what?
[11:01:44] <Fraz> so youre notpicking. its not like i came in here to talk about something unrelated to jquery
[11:01:47] <Fraz> nit*
[11:01:54] <decx> your logic is wrong adavia
[11:02:34] <adavia> decx:  guess so
[11:02:35] <decx> your semantic as well
[11:02:42] <decx> ul cant have a direct ul child
[11:02:58] <adavia> thats why im using find()
[11:03:36] <decx> you want the handler on the a
[11:03:42] <shoky> Fraz: i was just pointing out that your question was irrelevant, as you're not even using jquery's animate. call it what you want
[11:03:43] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/V4ezd/1/
[11:04:08] <shoky> Fraz: it was me nudging you to ask a more relevant question. just trying to help
[11:04:21] <Fraz> shoky, what?
[11:04:35] <Fraz> Fallback to frame-based animation
[11:04:35] <Fraz> If you would like to fallback to classic animation when transitions aren't supported, just manually redefine .transitition to .animate.
[11:04:39] <adavia> deck u are right.. i was clicking the a tag
[11:04:41] <Fraz> i will be using animate as a fallback
[11:04:53] <Fraz> transit says to simply replace .transition with .animate
[11:05:54] <Fraz> so the transit site is telling me to do this, but youre telling me .animate doesnt accept the translate propery
[11:06:04] <shoky> right, it doesn't
[11:06:50] <Fraz> so, what im wanting to know is what will happen in this case? will it error or will i just end up with translate not working?
[11:07:19] <Fraz> initially i was just wondering if jquery might take translate and convert it to left/top or something
[11:07:24] <shoky> if that library doesn't do anything to $.animate  then it will fail
[11:08:12] <Fraz> ok thanks
[11:13:20] <SkyLeach> hey all
[11:13:37] <SkyLeach> I'm having an issue with a function reference not getting called when the callback event takes place
[11:13:46] <SkyLeach> jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/6pEAG/3/
[11:14:27] <SkyLeach> I'm actually trying to eliminate the case statement, so please ignore the redundant code
[11:14:49] <SkyLeach> the relevant block starts at 238 through the end of the case block
[11:14:59] <duch_kazatel> SkyLeach first, is it possible for you do update the version of jquery you‚Äôre using?
[11:15:19] <duch_kazatel> also, that eval() is totally unnecessary.
[11:15:19] <SkyLeach> duch_kazatel, not at this time.  I'm sure you noticed the version I'm using.
[11:15:26] <SkyLeach> duch_kazatel, how so?
[11:15:45] <duch_kazatel> why do you think you need it?
[11:15:47] <SkyLeach> I thought it was either document['stringfuncname'] or eval(stringfuncname)
[11:16:04] <duch_kazatel> for what?
[11:16:09] <SkyLeach> string function references
[11:16:11] <shoky> eval is evil, in case you haven't heard
[11:16:35] <SkyLeach> well when you don't know where your function will reside you can't do document['myfunc'] ;-)
[11:16:41] <duch_kazatel> use window[‚ÄôfuncNameHere‚Äô] if you need to dynamically evaluate things attached to the window, but that‚Äôs really awkward.
[11:16:43] <SkyLeach> so in this case eval is a safer bet
[11:16:49] <shoky> you should know where your functions reside
[11:17:06] <SkyLeach> I work with the codebase I'm given
[11:17:32] <duch_kazatel> you‚Äôre right - programming is hard. let‚Äôs go shopping.
[11:17:33] <shoky> great excuse.
[11:17:52] <SkyLeach> I can't get permission to rewrite it all
[11:17:58] <SkyLeach> so I have to do what I'm allowed
[11:18:05] <duch_kazatel> you have to ask permission to do that?! woah.
[11:18:31] <SkyLeach> so, this is happening in the success function of a JQuery ajax call that returns a document fragment being processed by handlebars
[11:18:38] <SkyLeach> that's why the die/live stuff
[11:18:50] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[11:19:00] <SkyLeach> learn me what that is
[11:19:01] <duch_kazatel> that‚Äôs what you use .live() for.
[11:19:26] <duch_kazatel> events bubble up through the document - .live() was around so you could attach a single listener that would work even if you added/removed things from the page.
[11:19:49] <duch_kazatel> if you‚Äôre attaching listeners in your ajax success logic, then you‚Äôre doing it wrong.
[11:19:51] <SkyLeach> right...
[11:20:13] <SkyLeach> how should I do it instead?
[11:20:27] <duch_kazatel> by attaching the handler once outside of the ajax success.
[11:20:31] <duch_kazatel> and let it do its magic.
[11:20:37] <SkyLeach> and also, does this relate to why the callback isn't working?
[11:21:04] <SkyLeach> speciically the one callback that is returned by the eval
[11:21:12] <SkyLeach> it works in context, but the event doesn't call it
[11:21:27] <duch_kazatel> this relates to unbreaking some of your coode and reducing some overhead.  using eval() like that is a terrible idea and is apart of your problem i‚Äôll bet.
[11:21:47] <SkyLeach> I don't mind getting rid of eval, that's immaterial as far as I'm concerned
[11:22:17] <SkyLeach> but the issue is that if I name the function directly then it works, but if I pass a function reference from eval or document['myfunc'] it doesn't
[11:22:42] <SkyLeach> that's the part I would really like to understand
[11:23:36] <duch_kazatel> dunno about the eval, but window[myfunc] should work.
[11:23:47] <duch_kazatel> though that assumes the function is global.
[11:24:13] <SkyLeach> one sec...
[11:24:29] <SkyLeach> I have to go to my dev instance to test that, the fiddle is too siple
[11:24:32] <SkyLeach> simple
[11:24:38] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:24:44] <duch_kazatel> your fiddle SHOULD be simple.
[11:25:24] <SkyLeach> duch_kazatel, we live in the real world.  I'm a contractor hired to work on a large codebase written by a non-developer and I'm given deliverables.  I can't get permission to refactor the whole codebase so I have to fix what I can when I'm in a  portion of the code.
[11:25:31] <SkyLeach> that's why I'm trying to keep the focus limited.
[11:25:41] <SkyLeach> I would LOVE to recode a bunch of this **@% but I can't
[11:25:42] <duch_kazatel> oh okay.  iu‚Äô
[11:25:48] <duch_kazatel> *i‚Äôll go live in la-la land then.
[11:25:54] <duch_kazatel> sorry i‚Äôm not in the real world!  bummer for you!
[11:26:19] <SkyLeach> seriously?  you took that as an insult?
[11:26:31] <duch_kazatel> dunno how else you would have meant that ;)
[11:26:42] <duch_kazatel> i‚Äôm really nonplussed tbh.  try to give you advice either way.
[11:27:24] <SkyLeach> ugh
[11:27:25] <duch_kazatel> don‚Äôt use eval() and avoid trying to dynamically call functions like that.
[11:27:25] <decx> fight fight fight
[11:27:26] <SkyLeach> woops
[11:27:27] <SkyLeach> lol
[11:27:29] <duch_kazatel> seems really bizarre.
[11:27:44] <SkyLeach> I didn't know ctrl+i would split out the window in xchat
[11:27:45] <SkyLeach> ok
[11:28:46] <SkyLeach> anyhow, what I was trying to say is that the statement about this being the 'real world' is one commonly dealt with by us engineers.  The world isn't a functional program, things arne't always logical, sometimes we have to do things based on outside factors.  Thus I prefaced my statement with a contextual limiter.
[11:29:00] <duch_kazatel> oh ok.,
[11:29:31] <shoky> you come off as a condescending dick. whether you mean to or not
[11:29:38] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[11:29:49] <duch_kazatel> in my ‚Äúreal world‚Äù i tell people ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not going to happen unless you give me time to unfuck this terrible mess.‚Äù and then they thank me for being upfront.
[11:30:13] <s2013> if i have something like $(".custom_input").change(...); in my js file but custom_input does not exist until something triggers it
[11:33:05] <s2013> will that code ever work?
[11:33:07] <duch_kazatel> s2013 use event delegation instead.
[11:33:09] <s2013> what do you mean
[11:33:32] <duch_kazatel> $(parent).on(‚Äòchange‚Äô, ‚Äò.custom_input‚Äô, function(){});
[11:33:33] <duch_kazatel> where parent exists on pageload.
[11:33:33] <s2013> basically i have a piece of code that does not work from the script file but it works from console. so im guessing its cause that input field is programatically added
[11:33:33] <duch_kazatel> right - you can only bind to things that all ready exist.
[11:33:33] <s2013> k gotcha
[11:33:33] <s2013> thanks
[11:33:33] <duch_kazatel> deffo.
[11:33:33] <duch_kazatel> ps make sure you bind as low as possible in the document - avoid binding to body if you can.
[11:33:34] <SkyLeach> I apologize if I came off sounding condescending, it wasn't intentional.
[11:43:33] <drale2k> is there an easy way to add a property to a jQuery object? I want to add a simple state to a button like $btn = $("#mybutton"); $btn.isActive = true
[11:43:54] <duch_kazatel> you can use .data()
[11:44:01] <SkyLeach> I did some more testing and no matter how I pass the function reference it doesn't work unless I pass it directly.  windows['funcname'] and eval('funcname') don't work while .live('change', gtChangeServiceLine) does
[11:44:34] <SkyLeach> s/windows/window/g
[11:44:55] <duch_kazatel> the former doesn‚Äôt work if the function isn‚Äôt in the global scope.
[11:45:42] <SkyLeach> yeah I know, that's why I did it with eval originally.  But fortunately both return a function reference that is callable in scope.  It's only later on the event callback that something goes wrong.
[11:45:44] <SkyLeach> not sure what
[11:47:04] <duch_kazatel> were you passing a string to eval, btw?
[11:50:04] <SkyLeach> yes, it's on line 239: var funcname = 'gtChange'+fname.substring(2);
[11:50:28] <duch_kazatel> something tells me that was a scope issue.
[11:51:38] <farn5w0rth> how do i create jquery tags from copying and pasting multiple values? instead of pressing enter after each one? http://timschlechter.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/
[11:52:33] <GnuBoi> I've a button in DOM with id="thisisButton" called, In my js code, I've var mybtn = document.getElementById("thisisButton"); I console.logged mybtn and it shows the button html but when I do, mybtn.hide(); somwehere down in the code nothing happens.
[11:52:48] <duch_kazatel> GnuBoi because .hide() is a jquery method.
[11:52:52] <duch_kazatel> you need to use $()
[11:53:24] <GnuBoi> duch_kazatel:you mean like $(mybtn).hide(); ?
[11:53:44] <duch_kazatel> or just $(‚Äò#thisIsButton‚Äô).hide();
[11:53:57] <GnuBoi> duch_kazatel:ah
[11:54:16] <farn5w0rth> GnuBoi: yea do what duch_kazatel said or you could just do a $(‚Äò#thisisButton‚Äô).addClass(‚Äòhide‚Äô);
[11:55:29] <duch_kazatel> .hide() does more than add a class :)
[11:56:41] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: oh i didnt know‚Ä¶what‚Äôs the difference between them?
[11:56:59] <duch_kazatel> check out the docs.
[11:57:03] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[11:57:24] <GnuBoi> duch_kazatel: farn5w0rth I've something like $('#cancelApp_' + ApplicationId).hide(); and it's not working how should I put it all under quote?
[11:57:45] <duch_kazatel> GnuBoi no that‚Äôs the right syntax.
[11:58:41] <GnuBoi> duch_kazatel:It might not be because '#cancelApp_' + ApplicationId gets translated into #cancelApp_12 but it needs to be like "#cancelApp_12"
[11:59:13] <BillCriswell> GnuBoi: Make sure ApplicationId is what you think it is.
[11:59:20] <BillCriswell> There's no reason that code shouldn't work.
[12:03:05] <thebope> it is what you think it is
[12:03:40] <duch_kazatel> woah i came back to a PM.
[12:06:22] <duch_kazatel> GnuBoi if ApplicationId is a value, you will get a string out of what you pasted above.
[12:06:28] <duch_kazatel> *has a value, rather.
[12:08:18] <farn5w0rth> if i copy and paste many space separated text into a jquery tag input box - how do i create tags for each of the items copied in?
[12:08:54] <duch_kazatel> farn5w0rth you‚Äôd have to watch for the paste, remove the new stuff, parse it, and put it in I‚Äôll bet.
[12:08:57] <duch_kazatel> something like that, at least.
[12:10:14] <GnuBoi> duch_kazatel:I'm looking into it, it is an string value. I think there might two elements with same Id.
[12:10:20] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: ok so can i add a ‚Äò\n‚Äô after each one to generate the tag? in order for a new tag to be created the user has to hit return
[12:10:35] <duch_kazatel> farn5w0rth can you prefill that field with tags?
[12:10:42] <duch_kazatel> \n is a newline - has nothing to do with creating tags.,‚Äô
[12:10:53] <farn5w0rth> yea you can prefill it
[12:11:11] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: yea but \n is the same as pressing enter in a textarea input right?
[12:11:15] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:11:23] <farn5w0rth> lol ok
[12:11:57] <duch_kazatel> \n is a character, not an event :)
[12:13:52] <thebope> hmm, I dunno why I can't communicate on ##javascript
[12:15:07] <BillCriswell> thebope: What do you mean?
[12:16:44] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: ok so how do you think i can send an event like return after each word?
[12:18:53] <djQuery> thebope, are you authenticated, I couldnt either till i authenticated           /msg NickServ identify
[12:19:06] <thebope> djQuery, yea haha, that was the issue
[12:19:12] <thebope> I hadn't realized I had been disconnected
[12:19:17] <thebope> and needed to reidentify
[12:19:26] <thebope> Thanks man
[12:21:52] <mogaj> hi, i am using jquery steps http://www.jquery-steps.com/ can someone tell me how to refresh and stay on the same step but not navigate to first one while submitting a form?
[12:23:50] <duch_kazatel> farn5w0rth you don‚Äôt - you should see what API methods there are to add words.
[12:24:01] <drej> i like APIs that add words
[12:24:09] <duch_kazatel> right?
[12:24:16] <farn5w0rth> lol
[12:24:29] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: ok cool let me check it out now :)
[12:27:55] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: i can manually add words in the input value? im using this: https://github.com/xoxco/jQuery-Tags-Input
[12:30:23] <duch_kazatel> dunno.  you‚Äôll have to read their docs.
[12:30:36] <duch_kazatel> i gotta go to lunch here in a sec or i‚Äôd help you figure that out.
[12:32:25] <farn5w0rth> duch_kazatel: no worries - i‚Äôll try and look for it :)
[12:36:28] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, are you detecting the paste yet?
[12:37:36] <djQuery> there is an onpaste event but it actually fires before the change event
[12:38:16] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: oh really? im actually using a different tags plugin (chosen)
[12:38:51] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, setup a jsbin or jsfiddle and I will try to help
[12:39:09] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: can i do something like $(‚Äú#input‚Äù).chosen().change(‚Ä¶ok
[12:39:33] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, chosen?
[12:39:40] <krambiorix> is it possible to transform an ajax response string (xml code) to a file download ?
[12:39:49] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[12:42:42] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, hate it when plugins dont actually post the api
[12:43:46] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, put together a jsbin with the plugin allready loaded and a sample with the chosen applied to it and we will finger it out
[12:43:59] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: yep doing that now
[12:49:04] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, hmmmm AbstractChosen.prototype.clipboard_event_checker
[12:50:18] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, from looking at the demo on their web site pasting multiple "words" might be a little weird anyway
[12:50:53] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: yea all the plugins are weird for that
[12:51:05] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, I got the drop down and only the first word
[12:51:10] <farn5w0rth> i dont think chosen is the correct plugin for this anyway
[12:51:17] <farn5w0rth> im realizing
[12:51:49] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: here let‚Äôs work with this: http://jsfiddle.net/7aDak/5018/
[12:52:09] <Xliff> d...j... Quuueeeerrryyyyyy!
[12:56:20] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, you are allready firing on an on change evernt, I see some problem with you logic though
[12:56:36] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: yea the logic is messed up im playing around with it
[12:56:39] <djQuery> do a replace of space with , and then replace ,, with ,
[12:57:10] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: wait what?
[12:57:27] <djQuery> and I do not see an element with the id of tags
[12:57:49] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, what if someone pastes in   this, is a , test
[12:57:55] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: updated: http://jsfiddle.net/7aDak/5021/
[12:58:25] <BillCriswell> 5021
[12:58:28] <BillCriswell> Dammmmmmmm
[12:58:30] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: right now its just proken
[12:58:32] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, that would turn into this,,is,a,,,test
[12:58:32] <farn5w0rth> broken
[12:59:54] <decx> 5021 :o
[13:00:26] <farn5w0rth> lol its 5021 because i copied the fiddle from the plugin site and updated from there
[13:01:07] <BillCriswell> I love picking random numbers to see what people were trying.
[13:03:16] <decx> hehe
[13:03:47] <VectorX> trying to add an object to an array of objects as i see but getting an undefined error, http://jsfiddle.net/79zJ6/1/ scroll down to where the comment is
[13:04:29] <decx> you cant push into an object
[13:07:24] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/7aDak/5029/ think im getting somewhere
[13:11:37] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, why are you nesting the the events?
[13:12:16] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: im trying to follow their documentation for the onChange events
[13:12:45] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, well it worked but I just got 1 tag for "ecreate the problem here" not a different one for each word
[13:12:51] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, is that what you wanted?
[13:13:09] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: no i want to seperate them
[13:13:22] <djQuery> if you do it different then you wont be able to enter tags that use more than one word
[13:13:53] <farn5w0rth> what do you think i should do
[13:14:01] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, then all you should have to do is change the space to ,
[13:14:12] <djQuery> I dont know the use case
[13:14:51] <Xliff> VectorX: worker should be an array of objects, not an object.
[13:14:56] <djQuery> if you dont replace spaces with comas you will have users bitching that they have to do it
[13:15:16] <Xliff> Sodafrukt: ranger["workers"] = [worker];
[13:15:23] <djQuery> if you do they will bitch that the cant add a tag like "very funny"
[13:15:28] <Xliff> s/Sodafruit/So:/
[13:15:30] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: the use case is copying a list from ms excel
[13:15:46] <farn5w0rth> they‚Äôre always seperated by spaces
[13:15:56] <farn5w0rth> no commas
[13:16:08] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, are any of them over going to be a multiword tag?
[13:16:16] <farn5w0rth> nope
[13:16:35] <djQuery> then just do a replace real quick and you should be done
[13:16:48] <Xliff> VectorX: Still other issues
[13:17:02] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: a replace where again? ive changed it a bunch and dont remember what version you‚Äôre looking at ha
[13:18:21] <Xliff> VectorX: data is an array. Was that intentional?
[13:18:24] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, http://jsfiddle.net/7aDak/5034/
[13:18:29] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, soemthing like that
[13:18:48] <Xliff> If so: data[0].rangers.workers.add(worker)
[13:18:55] <Xliff> s/add/push/
[13:19:44] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, but I still don;t think you understand what I mean by a multi word tag
[13:19:57] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, but then again you are more familar with your data
[13:20:01] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: no i dont think i do
[13:20:19] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, give me examples of some tags
[13:20:45] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: the use case will be only numbers so for example: the user will copy and paste 10 lines of 101 302 401 ‚Ä¶ and the tags should be created between each space
[13:21:11] <VectorX> Xliff the output should end up as http://jsfiddle.net/79zJ6/4/
[13:21:15] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, thats bad then
[13:21:29] <djQuery> what if someone has a number of 1,555,232
[13:21:42] <VectorX> Xliff it has to be in that format to pass json to an app, but using JS
[13:21:47] <farn5w0rth> the max characters is 3
[13:22:04] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: i think its super simple but im just dumb ha
[13:22:09] <djQuery> farn5w0rth, then should work
[13:22:46] <farn5w0rth> djQuery: how?
[13:23:48] <djQuery> damit someone what is the correct syntax for his.text = this.text.replace(' ', ',');
[13:24:03] <djQuery> his.text = this.text.replace(' ',/g '/,');
[13:24:31] <farn5w0rth> space is /\s/g
[13:24:58] <VectorX> Xliff ok think i got some help in #javascript
[13:26:22] <Etriaph> Hey folks, I'm run into a snag I've never run into with jQuery before, at https://gist.github.com/Etriaph/e9de76f4b0ef37d9754d
[13:26:59] <Etriaph> I'm using .each inside a JavaScript class, and I think that the class 'this' and the .each 'this' are colliding
[13:27:36] <systemfault> Etriaph: It‚Äôs exactly that. Just add var that = this; after line 2 and before line 3
[13:27:52] <systemfault> Etriaph: Then use that.defaults[‚Ä¶.]
[13:28:04] <Etriaph> Ah, OK.
[13:28:49] <systemfault> Unrelated but be careful if you use K&R style bracket placement‚Ä¶ it could bite you in the future.
[13:29:16] <systemfault> s/bracket/curly brace
[13:30:10] <Etriaph> It's Allman style, but ya, never had an issue with it before.
[13:31:39] <Etriaph> Why, though, just out of curiosity, would it make a difference?
[13:31:54] <Etriaph> Especially considering I minify everything.
[13:32:03] <systemfault> Etriaph: The classic ‚Äúreturn‚Äù example
[13:32:25] <Etriaph> Ah, I see, evaluation vs. otherwise you mean?
[13:32:47] <systemfault> Etriaph: That one http://jsfiddle.net/Leq6Z/
[13:33:35] <systemfault> You would expect lol() to return { lol: 42 } but you get ‚Äúundefined"
[13:38:37] <Etriaph> That is just about the strangest behaviour I've seen this month.
[13:38:55] <systemfault> That‚Äôs because of Javascript‚Äôs ASI
[13:39:07] <systemfault> Automatic Semi-colon Insertion
[13:39:30] <systemfault> The parse inserts a semi-colon at the end of line 3
[13:39:34] <systemfault> *parser
[13:39:47] <rga> Someone help me? Why jquery validation is not working on appended elements?
[13:40:02] <systemfault> The following lines are then unreacheable‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs still valid code, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúblock‚Äù with a label in it
[13:40:42] <systemfault> Putting the open curly brace on the same line fixes that issue.
[13:41:41] <foua> Is it possible to have the $('fooform').submit() actually send a regular POST request, rather than using a query string?
[13:42:05] <systemfault> foua: By adding the method=‚ÄúPOST‚Äù attribute on the form
[13:42:53] <foua> I love you
[13:42:57] <foua> Thank you!
[14:07:09] <Guesticles> if I do a basic modal dialog box, can I put a print function on the dialog box to print only what's within that box?
[14:09:00] <duch_kazatel> just include a print stylesheet on the page when the modal opens and remove it when it‚Äôs closed.
[14:09:12] <duch_kazatel> the print stylesheet can be used to hide everything you don‚Äôt care about.
[14:11:02] <Guesticles> Thanks duch_kazatel
[14:11:20] <Egahtrac> Hey, anyone good with using ajax and php together?
[14:15:01] <systemfault> Just ask‚Ä¶ most people here are familar with both.
[14:16:26] <Egahtrac> i've been doing alot of video tutorials with ajax and php, i'm starting to familiarize myself with all of it
[14:16:44] <Egahtrac> i've been able to access db information and update it without refreshing etc
[14:16:53] <systemfault> Great :)
[14:17:04] <Egahtrac> i have a TON of php code written for a game, but i want alot of that to be executed without page refreshes
[14:17:16] <Egahtrac> and i'm having trouble wrapping my mind around how to execute an entire php script through ajax
[14:17:24] <duch_kazatel> by calling it :)
[14:17:35] <Egahtrac> yes haha of course
[14:17:42] <Egahtrac> but just trying to make something simple like
[14:17:42] <duch_kazatel> expose it through a URL
[14:17:48] <Egahtrac> echo'ing hello world from php through ajax
[14:17:50] <Egahtrac> i can't even figure that out
[14:18:31] <duch_kazatel> setup a URL that‚Äôll echo a querystring param.
[14:19:06] <Egahtrac> i guess my question is, if i have the hello world echo set up in php
[14:19:22] <Egahtrac> through a normal php call, it will refresh the page and echo hello world
[14:19:35] <Egahtrac> in order to do that with ajax
[14:19:44] <duch_kazatel> ajax is going to hit a URL.
[14:19:45] <Egahtrac> does the hello world string have to be called into ajax
[14:19:57] <duch_kazatel> you mean the string from the PHP side?
[14:20:00] <Egahtrac> yes
[14:20:07] <duch_kazatel> yeah you‚Äôll return that using .done.
[14:20:20] <Egahtrac> ok
[14:20:28] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax(‚Äòsomeurl/echo.php‚Äô).done(function(data){console.log(data)});
[14:20:31] <systemfault> Egahtrac: You‚Äôre overcomplicating AJAX, it‚Äôs just a HTTP client‚Ä¶ You give it a url and it gives you a page back.
[14:20:33] <duch_kazatel> it‚Äôll look something like that.
[14:20:40] <Egahtrac> O.o
[14:20:59] <duch_kazatel> systemfault is correct though, it‚Äôs just a request.  almost like any other.
[14:21:04] <Egahtrac> right
[14:21:21] <Egahtrac> so if i have
[14:21:24] <Egahtrac> if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') { 	 	if (isset($_POST['attack'])) { 		echo 'It worked'; 	} 		 		 }
[14:21:43] <Egahtrac> can that be run without a page refresh and will it actually echo on my page
[14:22:04] <duch_kazatel> page refresh != ajax ;)
[14:22:17] <Egahtrac> i don't want the page to refresh =D
[14:22:18] <duch_kazatel> calling that page via ajax runs it.
[14:22:31] <Egahtrac> k
[14:22:31] <duch_kazatel> that doesn‚Äôt refresh anything - how would it via ajax?
[14:23:32] <systemfault> Egahtrac: Then you need to do $.post('page.php', { attack: 1 }).done(function(data) {alert(data); });
[14:23:45] <Egahtrac> i'll try that
[14:31:19] <winterpk66> Is there a way to fire an ajax request when the user closes their browser, or navigates away from a page?
[14:32:32] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[14:32:38] <duch_kazatel> why would you do that?
[14:32:43] <Es0teric> does .text() extract the text from a html element?
[14:32:52] <Tomashe> hey guys
[14:33:04] <Egahtrac> there shuld be
[14:33:05] <Tomashe> is that alot for resources on mobile : 12.26‚Äâs Scripting 42.000‚Äâms Rendering 283.309‚Äâms Painting
[14:33:23] <Egahtrac> aren't their document objects that execute if you close the browser?
[14:33:24] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: perfect question for http://api.jquery.com/text/
[14:33:47] <Egahtrac> like $('document').ready does for when the page loads
[14:33:56] <duch_kazatel> the request would need to complete.
[14:33:59] <duch_kazatel> which is the issue.
[14:34:06] <Egahtrac> i see
[14:34:10] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: only reason why i ask is because i am looping through <dd> tags and using $.each() with v.text() and console.log is throwing error
[14:34:11] <Es0teric> s
[14:34:25] <duch_kazatel> closing the browser should close the browser, not ‚Äúkind of close it‚Äù while the browser completes a particular request.
[14:34:32] <winterpk66> duch_kazatel: because I want to fire and ajax request when the user browser, or navigates away from the page.
[14:34:36] <NoiseEee> start with the error then Es0teric
[14:34:55] <duch_kazatel> winterpk66 right - why?
[14:35:18] <Es0teric> NoiseEee:  -> 	    TypeError: v.text is not a function console.log(v.text());
[14:35:27] <winterpk66> the why is complicated
[14:35:50] <duch_kazatel> winterpk66 are you trying to determine some kind of analytics?
[14:36:10] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: if you're looping over elements, you need to make the element a jquery object.  ie:  someCollection.each(function(i,el) { el = $(el); //now el.text() will work })
[14:36:15] <winterpk66> no, in short I'm trying to determine if a user is on a specific page
[14:36:24] <Es0teric> NoiseEee:  ah ok
[14:37:28] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: freakin perfect.. that worked
[14:37:29] <Es0teric> thanks
[14:39:25] <NoiseEee> np Es0teric
[14:42:47] <jailbot> any advice to using .height()?
[14:43:26] <cannap> hi how can i select all li under the button? to the next button http://jsfiddle.net/t5AXr/16/ ?
[14:43:56] <cannap> or beter say add a class to the li under one button
[14:44:02] <thomasgriffin> is there a more performant way to do this in jquery? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/99dab4d6d08397b49d42
[14:52:46] <systemfault> thomasgriffin: using class names.
[15:04:34] <frank_o> Howdy! Can I do `var a = $('.a'), var b = $('.b'), var aAndB = a + b`?
[15:04:35] <frank_o> Or must I do `var a = $('.a'), var b = $('.b'), var aAndB = $('.a, .b')`?
[15:06:37] <decx> you can use add() but it's slow
[15:07:46] <rmill> ?api add
[15:07:46] <b-ot> rmill: .add(): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[15:09:02] <frank_o> sweeet !! thanks guys :)
[15:09:08] <frank_o> for the record: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ACTX7/1/
[15:11:35] <frank_o> These two are the same right? $(this).find('a') and $('a', this) -- if so which one is faster?
[15:12:22] <decx> it's about the same
[15:12:31] <frank_o> cool
[15:12:36] <frank_o> Which one do you prefer?
[15:12:40] <decx> note that add() will be much slower than a combined selector
[15:12:59] <frank_o> It's ok I guess..
[15:13:00] <rmill> Just syntactic sugar, nobody really uses `$( 'a', this )`
[15:13:23] <decx> shut your whore mouth, selector context is awesome and i use it all the time
[15:13:24] <decx> ^^
[15:13:29] <frank_o> rmill: Awesome!! I think $(this).find('a') makes a lot more sense personally
[15:13:56] <frank_o> hahah
[15:14:02] <rmill> -__-
[15:14:17] <rmill> Call me a whore again‚Ä¶
[15:15:00] <decx> domination costs after the first taste, your safe-word is undefined
[15:15:41] <frank_o> haha
[15:15:45] <rmill> >_<
[15:16:09] <frank_o> Just saw a movie about safe words and dominatrix -- scrapper -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlZQLdIjmb4
[15:16:09] <decx> the important people are always into the kinky stuff :D
[15:16:12] <frank_o> one of those rare gems
[15:16:28] <frank_o> wasnt really about safe words and dominatrix but i mean
[15:16:54] * rmill sighs
[15:17:19] <decx> hey it's lord baelish
[15:17:40] <frank_o> yeah =)
[15:17:55] <rmill> He's in a lot of great things.
[15:18:02] <rmill> The Wire
[15:18:17] <decx> i never actually watched the wire
[15:18:21] <frank_o> oh yeah
[15:18:24] <frank_o> best example by far
[15:18:25] <decx> is the hype warranted?
[15:18:31] <rmill> YES
[15:18:33] <frank_o> its more than warranted
[15:18:49] <decx> well i guess it could climb a few spots on the series backlog
[15:18:49] <frank_o> considering watching it for the 10th time lol
[15:19:51] <frank_o> what if ... I could use jQuery (amongst other things) ... to take me to where Marlo's at
[15:40:20] <checkit> Hey guys. Looking for some opinions here. I'm building an application where visitors can record and upload there voice as part of a song. Currently we're using html5 audio, JavaScript and the GetUserMedia API to do this. But converting the audio format on the client machine and uploading to the server has been unreliable. Is there a way, maybe with websockets, to open a stream for this?
[15:42:16] <Velveeta> hey! that was lord baelish! http://i.imgur.com/XGAA1Lx.png
[17:47:49] <uskerine> hi, while generating a JSON object:
[17:48:17] <uskerine>  var data = { .... "total": $('#fooTotal').html(),   .... }
[17:48:27] <uskerine> that generates "total": "99"
[17:48:32] <uskerine> how could I generate "total": 99
[17:48:32] <uskerine> ?
[17:49:35] <duch_kazatel> parseInt($('#fooTotal').html(), 10);
[17:49:57] <uskerine> what does 10 do?
[17:50:01] <duch_kazatel> radix
[17:50:14] <uskerine> if number is 99.99
[17:50:18] <uskerine> would that work too?
[17:50:28] <duch_kazatel> then use parseFloat()
[17:50:30] <duch_kazatel> same syntax
[17:50:56] <uskerine> does exist something like BigDecimal -or venerable cobol PIC 9999.99- format in JS?
[17:51:26] <uskerine> as 99.99 is not technically a float, but a bigdecimal (in java) or whatever you want to call
[17:51:30] <duch_kazatel> there is only one data type for numbers in JS.  it‚Äôs called ‚Äúnumber‚Äù ;) it‚Äôs a 64bit double.
[17:52:00] <uskerine> ok, parseFloat then
[17:52:03] <uskerine> thanks
[17:53:11] <duch_kazatel> rather, javascript numbers are similar to Java‚Äôs double and Double - they‚Äôre 64-bit floating point
[17:53:23] <duch_kazatel> keep in mind that math in JS is a sketch proposition.
[17:53:33] <duch_kazatel> especially with decimals.
[17:54:10] <uskerine> maybe I should pass them as strings and do some conversion stuff in java
[17:56:00] <R13ose> hi
[17:57:07] <R13ose> how come this accordion is working: http://development.carinarose.com/projects/charlevoix/ below the slideshow on the left side and one here: http://development.carinarose.com/product/green-arrow-plume/ is not from price to additional information in right side?
[17:59:02] <duch_kazatel> uskerine yes you should.
[18:05:16] <antlong_> what can i use to either check if a simplemodal window is open, or is the modal is visible?
[18:14:19] <R13ose> any ideas on my question?
[18:29:46] <Xliff> R13ose: Something is off with the broken page. Chrome can't debug it.
[18:30:07] <R13ose> Xliff: really?
[18:30:40] <Xliff> I'm on dev branch and if I set a breakpoint where the accordion loads, it doesn't load the whole file.
[18:30:56] <Xliff> One thing to note.... too many $(document).ready() invocations.
[18:31:05] <R13ose> Xliff: right
[18:31:08] <Xliff> It's not supposed to matter, but really. That is just going to cause problems.
[18:32:32] <R13ose> Xliff: I will fix that but the accordion is what I am wondering about.
[18:32:38] <Xliff> I am looking.
[18:39:49] <Xliff> R13ose: Which accordion is this?
[18:40:39] <R13ose> Xliff: meaning?
[18:40:58] <Xliff> Is this jQuery UI? or something else?
[18:41:28] <Xliff> If so, your markup is ENTIRELY wrong.
[18:41:36] <Xliff> http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[18:48:11] <R13ose> Xliff: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/ might be this, I didn't add this in so trying to make this work
[18:48:35] <Xliff> Still means your markup is wrong.
[18:48:38] <Xliff> See the example?
[18:48:59] <Xliff> Your div is full of <p> tags. Look at the example and rework accordingly.
[18:50:50] <R13ose> Xliff: okay I will fix but will that fix everything?
[18:58:32] <R13ose> Xliff: I have removed some of the code.
[19:02:12] <R13ose> Xliff: thanks, I think I need a huge break but again thank you for looking at my crazy code.
[19:02:42] <Xliff> R13ose: your markup is still wrong
[19:02:58] <Xliff> I will fiddle it for you. I will send you PM.
[19:03:13] <R13ose> Xliff: thanks.  I am sorry you have to do that.
[19:03:29] <Xliff> R13ose: How long have you been doing HTML/CSS/jQ?
[19:04:22] <R13ose> Xliff: For a very long time.  This website is just me taking from another developer and fixing this plus adding new features.  I didn't add the accordion at all.
[19:05:14] <Xliff> OK, WHAT should accordion?
[19:05:19] <Xliff> I only see one header, here.
[19:07:00] <R13ose> Xliff: you see in both pages, there are items in the left side under the slideshow that should accordion on the first page.  The second page, I want the whole text from price to additional information tab to accordion but there will be other items on the right side of the second page that accordion too.
[19:07:34] <Xliff> I don't see a header "PRICE". I will look further.
[19:08:08] <Xliff> You mean this?
[19:08:20] <Xliff> <p class="price"><span class="amount">30.00&#36;</span></p>
[19:08:22] <Xliff> ?
[19:09:35] <R13ose> yep that
[19:09:41] <R13ose> I want to start below that
[19:25:51] <Xliff> http://jsfiddle.net/r7sRU/13/
[19:26:05] <Xliff> R13ose: Please note the change in markup (which you should have picked up)
[19:26:25] <Xliff> Note also that I am using jQuery 1.9 instead of 1.10 because for some reason the fiddle isn't picking it up.
[19:27:31] <Xliff> R13ose: http://jsfiddle.net/r7sRU/16/ <- Latest revision.
[19:27:45] <Xliff> That should be enough to get you going.
[19:28:47] <R13ose> Xliff: thanks
[19:28:49] <Xliff> http://jsfiddle.net/r7sRU/17/ <- Recommend starting off with all collapsed.
[19:29:00] <Xliff> And I bounce!
[19:38:32] <chrisTech2> I'm trying to make it hide only the divs after the clicked element within the block where the element I clicked is residing (the next block shouldn't hide too, only when I click the dial within its block). What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/hYDz2/
[19:50:37] <frankson> hey! anyone know a handy way to get what the value of an element's css property will be after a transition, before the transition has occurred?
[19:53:17] <frankson> i have some categories that change color on hover, and i want to color the headings of articles in that category in a matching color, but when the mouseenter event fires, the color hasnt changed yet

[21:26:51] <arunbabu> Is it possible to specify the attributes given in window.open directly in an html file? onclick="window.open('calcweb/grecalc.html','','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,width=193,height=283,left=0,top=0');" I need to have these properties respected when I manually open the .html file
[21:42:09] <_August_> can someone help me real quick? I have a click function within an each function and one of the functions which is the "GotoSlide()" function isnt looping thru the incremnted numbers i have setup, it just stays at 0. Im pretty sure im doing this right or is there something i am missing? http://pastebin.com/udfMiBik
[21:43:23] <Etriaph> Anyone familiar with Bootstrap in here?
[22:12:06] <CapM_> Anyone there?
[22:14:34] <CapM_> $( document ).ready(function() {       $( "a" ).click(function( event ) {       });   });
[22:15:55] <CapM_> anyone there?
[22:21:50] <Etriaph> Having issues CapM?
[22:21:58] <CapM_> Hey
[22:22:26] <CapM_> General question because it seems as though my jQuery instructor has not done so
[22:23:22] <CapM_> On the jQuery website it says to download link jQuery 2.x or 1
[22:24:00] <CapM_> and save it as a jQuery.js
[22:24:06] <Etriaph> Yup.
[22:24:09] <CapM_> then link it
[22:24:21] <CapM_> btw the HTML and Script.js
[22:24:47] <CapM_> is this necessary to do if im using notepad++
[22:24:57] <Xliff|Bounce> Yes.
[22:25:05] <Xliff|Bounce> It's necessary to do that in any environment.
[22:25:15] <Etriaph> ^
[22:25:32] <CapM_> Ok ok, the download from jQuery.com what should i use, compressed or uncompressed
[22:26:04] <Xliff|Bounce> When developing, use uncompressed. On production you can switch to the minified version and test to insure nothing has broken.
[22:26:20] <CapM_> Great!
[22:26:26] <Xliff|Bounce> Me personally, I'd prefer to avoid minified scripts... mainly because unexpected things can happen.
[22:26:37] <gt8ost4l> anyone know of a good book depicting the jquery ui autocomplete plugin
[22:26:43] <Xliff|Bounce> And you'll be tearing your head out trying to figure out what.
[22:26:43] <CapM_> Yes absolutely
[22:27:24] <CapM_> on the index.html page, i have <script src="jquery.js"></script> 	<script>
[22:27:36] <Etriaph> gt8ost4l: Lots of information online about it, it's a very common feature nowadays.
[22:28:21] <Etriaph> <script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/js/folder/jquery.js"></script>
[22:28:30] <CapM_> but else should i put and where do i put $( document ).ready(function() {       $( "a" ).click(function( event ) {       });   }); on the script.js page
[22:28:40] <gt8ost4l> etriaph: but you never seen a depictive book on the subject
[22:28:55] <CapM_> thanks Etriaph
[22:29:02] <Etriaph> gt8ost4l: No, I don't think I've ever seen one.  It's not a complicated subject necessarily.
[22:29:26] <Etriaph> CapM_: You'll want to put *your* JavaScript in a file on it's own, after the script statement for jQuery.
[22:29:42] <Etriaph> CapM_: Don't add your custom stuff into the jquery.js file
[22:30:04] <gt8ost4l> etriaph: are there resources on first te basics of it
[22:30:11] <Etriaph> gt8ost4l: If you've never done it before it can seem like a lot of work, but it's actually quite simple.
[22:30:22] <Etriaph> gt8ost4l: For autocomplete?
[22:30:24] <gt8ost4l> yes
[22:30:50] <CapM_> What I mean is, that jQuery syntax " $( document ).ready(function() {       $( "a" ).click(function( event ) {       });   }); " should i leave it in my index.HTML
[22:31:26] <Etriaph> gt8ost4l: http://www.pontikis.net/blog/jquery-ui-autocomplete-step-by-step
[22:31:43] <Etriaph> gt8ost4l: That's a reasonably simple example.
[22:33:05] <Etriaph> CapM_: You can put that in the <HEAD> element, so <HEAD><SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function(){ $("a").click(function(event) {} }); });</SCRIPT></HEAD>
[22:33:59] <Etriaph> Or you can put your script in a file of your own, such as custom_scripts.js, and do <SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript" SRC="/path/to/custom_scripts.js"></SCRIPT>
[22:34:06] <CapM_> OH
[22:34:08] <CapM_> right
[22:34:44] <CapM_> but anywhere will do in the script.js file?
[22:35:11] <CapM_> You said no custom stuff, i misunderstood
[22:35:24] <CapM_> anyway stupid question, im new
[22:35:58] <Xliff|Bounce> CapM_: Unless your file gets too big, I would keep the jQuery code YOU write in your HTML
[22:36:32] <CapM_> Thanks
[22:36:38] <Xliff|Bounce> I would NOT split it up into its own file unless your code gets large.
[22:37:21] <Xliff|Bounce> Rule of thumb: If you have 20k of HTML and 10k of Javascript, then I would consider moving out the JS.
[22:37:37] <Xliff|Bounce> Of course, use what works for you. The key here is readability and flow.
[22:37:56] <Xliff|Bounce> Once you move your .js to another file, sometimes it can be hard to find the context. Especially if you are a new user.
[22:38:19] <CapM_> right right but you dont mean 20k lines of code right lol?
[22:38:28] <Xliff|Bounce> No. 20k bytes.
[22:38:38] <CapM_> ok great
[22:38:53] <Xliff|Bounce> So if your index.html is 30k and your JS is 10k of that, then separation will help.
[22:38:57] <Xliff|Bounce> But I find not until then.
[22:39:03] <Xliff|Bounce> YMMV
[22:39:09] <Tman> Hey guys, anyone on?
[22:39:15] <Xliff|Bounce> ? ask
[22:39:21] <Xliff|Bounce> ?ask
[22:39:21] <b-ot> Xliff|Bounce: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:39:41] <Xliff|Bounce> ^Tman
[22:40:18] <Tman> I am currently using youmax, it will show the everything and will load the videos from youtube in a playlist, but will not show the rest of the videos in the play list and when you click on the videos in the playlist it will do nothing but if you click on the featured/uploaded videos they will play fine =/
[22:40:46] <Tman> It used to work but recently just didnt work =/
[22:41:13] <Xliff|Bounce> You might want to talk to the devs of youmax, then.
[22:41:20] <Xliff|Bounce> This channel is for jQuery
[22:41:25] <Tman> Well I
[22:41:34] <Tman> Ive tried everything for youmax and get pointed at jquery
[22:41:39] <swemoney> Does anyone use the jquery.fileupload.js plugin? I‚Äôm looking for a callback for after the upload template is drawn so I can put some dynamic content inside the template before the user starts the upload. not seeing any way of doing this.
[22:41:42] <Tman> youmax is a plugin for jquery
[22:41:46] <Xliff|Bounce> OK
[22:42:02] <Xliff|Bounce> Tman: Do you have an example on the web?
[22:42:12] <Tman> Yes just one second.
[22:43:00] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: Isa this the one on github or the jQuery UI version?
[22:43:21] <Tman> Its happening on my friends site right now just sec ill get you the link
[22:43:25] <swemoney> the one on github. i didn‚Äôt know there was a jquery-ui version. is it similar?
[22:43:34] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: ^
[22:43:37] <Xliff|Bounce> See for yourself: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CEcQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fplugins.jquery.com%2Fblueimp-file-upload-jquery-ui%2F&ei=RGGqU8SlOcql8QHgvoDwBA&usg=AFQjCNFdChQjMmAt8Vr_fR6M_Z0ULOJYVA&sig2=KOXGmB7fLoawJW4kPVrs3A&bvm=bv.69620078,d.b2U
[22:43:47] <Xliff|Bounce> Oopps... damned google.
[22:43:57] <Xliff|Bounce> http://plugins.jquery.com/blueimp-file-upload-jquery-ui/
[22:44:07] <Tman> http://www.rotman.uwo.ca/videos/
[22:44:16] <Tman> if you see below and you click on playlists beside all
[22:44:18] <swemoney> heh. link still worked.
[22:44:21] <Tman> it will load the videos but not the thumnails
[22:44:37] <Tman> and when you click a video in the playlist section it will not load the videos
[22:44:51] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: the github one is same one as the ‚ÄúLink to Homepage‚Äù leads to from there, though
[22:45:09] <Xliff|Bounce> k
[22:45:33] <Xliff|Bounce> Tman: Youmax has bugs in it. Try the unminified version.
[22:45:51] <Tman> Unminified?
[22:45:56] <Xliff|Bounce> It's pointless trying to debug minified scripts.
[22:46:02] <Xliff|Bounce> Tman: Yes,
[22:46:19] <Tman> sorry for being a noob, but where can i find the unminified version?
[22:46:57] <Xliff|Bounce> http://www.rotman.uwo.ca/wp-content/themes/vantage/js/youmax.min.js <- that is a minified script.
[22:47:06] <Xliff|Bounce> I would guess you could find it on the Youmax site.
[22:47:12] <Xliff|Bounce> Google it. :)
[22:48:09] <Tman> So basically just upload the updated version? haha sorry
[22:49:37] <RockinAkin> can anyone help explain to me why my code works just fine if I grab the Exposure slider and slide it left or right, but it doesn't work if I click anywhere else on the bar to make it jump to that position?
[22:49:39] <RockinAkin> http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/
[22:49:45] <RockinAkin> it's driving me nuts
[22:50:13] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: OK. What are you trying to do again?
[22:50:25] <Xliff|Bounce> You want to add fields or elements before the actual upload?
[22:50:31] <swemoney> ya
[22:50:50] <Xliff|Bounce> What are you trying to do, exactly?
[22:51:12] <swemoney> which i can do. but I also want to add a little bit of extra jquery magic to make some of the form elements react to each other. like a select box changing it‚Äôs contents after another select box changes..
[22:51:42] <Xliff|Bounce> Like...how?
[22:51:55] <Xliff|Bounce> First suggestion, overload the add method as described here:
[22:52:07] <Xliff|Bounce> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Submit-files-asynchronously#overriding-the-add-callback
[22:52:14] <Tman> Bounce its just funny that it works fine with some youtube channels but not others, like it will work with the apple site and alot of the others ive checked but wont work with mine, and wont work with the nike youtube channel, would you be able to point me in the direction of possibly figuring this out.
[22:52:41] <Xliff|Bounce> Tman: My guess is that the problems you are experiencing have something to do with the errors in the script.
[22:52:59] <swemoney> the only way I‚Äôve figured out how to do this is really hacky and I‚Äôm looking for a better way. if i use strings to define my template in uploadTemplate: and I‚Äôd much rather use regular javascript templates
[22:53:05] <Xliff|Bounce> Other than that, I have no idea. You will HAVE to go to the source. Contact the youmax community and ask there. They will be better able to assist you.
[22:53:39] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: That's why you can override the add method.
[22:55:20] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: See -> http://pastebin.com/cuUmWAhR
[22:55:40] <Xliff|Bounce> At least I think that's what you want, based on what you've told me.
[22:55:51] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: That‚Äôs where I started and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using to grab the data from the form elements.. but the template hasn‚Äôt been rendered by then.
[22:55:58] <swemoney> at least not from what I can tell
[22:56:31] <swemoney> which seems strange and it could be a mistake that I‚Äôm making
[22:59:06] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: Look at the events section here -> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options
[23:00:08] <Xliff|Bounce> Are you using an uploadTemplate? If you want to move from strings (which I would recommend), you can use uploadTemplateId, which should point to a DOM element (which is hidden -- IE "display: none")
[23:02:34] <CapM_> Can you create a site like https://drive.google.com using jQuery language, node.js, and mongoDB?
[23:03:33] <swemoney> ya. i moved to strings and its ugly so looking to move back. my easy solution is to add a <script></script> tag inside the template which works in strings (if I close the template with ‚Äò</scr‚Äô+‚Äôipt>‚Äô) but not doing well in the normal template.
[23:04:03] <Xliff|Bounce> CapM_: That's fishing. That depends on what you want to do. I dont' see why you can't get close.
[23:04:22] <CapM_> Whats fishing?
[23:05:32] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: Otherwise, if that doesn't work. Use a function in uploadTemplate that builds the necessary elements from DOM templates.
[23:05:39] <Xliff|Bounce> Beats strings.
[23:06:01] <CapM_> you mean phishing
[23:06:34] <Xliff|Bounce> But if you want UI elements to change, then just attach the proper .change() events to the elements themselves, rather than worry about jQuery-File-Upload's issues.
[23:06:51] <Xliff|Bounce> Without more *specific* details on what you want, I really can't offer much in the way of suggestions.
[23:07:13] <Xliff|Bounce> To be honest, I think that's the best way to achieve what you want.
[23:07:39] <Xliff|Bounce> And you'd have to use Delegation to fire the events, since your elements are dynamically created.
[23:07:44] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: Might have to do something like that. I just tested by added a div with a specific ID and tried a console.log($(‚Äú#test123456‚Äù); inside the add callback. returns a blank array.
[23:08:02] <Xliff|Bounce> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/delegate-vs-on
[23:08:20] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: Can you fiddle what you just tried?
[23:09:45] <Xliff|Bounce> For delegation, always use .on()
[23:10:18] <RockinAkin> can anyone help me out?  this little bug is killing me!
[23:10:20] <RockinAkin> http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/
[23:10:39] <RockinAkin> my code works just fine if I grab the Exposure slider and slide it left or right, but it doesn't work if I click anywhere else on the slider bar to make it jump to that position.
[23:12:48] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: i‚Äôll see if i can fiddle it
[23:13:05] <Xliff|Bounce> Hrm. That article says exactly what I didn't want.
[23:46:06] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: http://jsfiddle.net/uYRre/ this is as far as I‚Äôve gotten. Sadly getting an error in jsfiddle I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere else.
[23:47:14] <swemoney> never used jsfiddle before, thou, so it could be something i‚Äôm doing wrong.
[23:50:10] <RockinAkin> can anyone help out?
[23:50:12] <RockinAkin> im lost
[23:50:16] <RockinAkin> been at this for hours
[23:51:02] <Cork> RockinAkin: not before you ask the question
[23:51:05] <Cork> ?ask
[23:51:05] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:51:13] <RockinAkin> i did. :)
[23:51:20] <RockinAkin> http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/
[23:51:26] <RockinAkin> my code works just fine if I grab the Exposure slider and slide it left or right, but it doesn't work if I click anywhere else on the slider bar to make it jump to that position.
[23:52:17] <RockinAkin> i cant figure it out for the life of me
[23:52:33] <Cork> RockinAkin: sounds like a browser bug then, cause it works fine here
[23:52:52] <RockinAkin> really?  what browser are you on?
[23:53:08] <Cork> firefox and chrome
[23:53:16] <RockinAkin> it does the same in either firefox or chrome for me
[23:53:38] <Cork> well exposure value works just find for me
[23:53:54] <RockinAkin> are you sure it works fine for you?
[23:54:02] <RockinAkin> it moves the other sliders as well?
[23:54:08] <Cork> sure
[23:54:14] <RockinAkin> just as if you were click-dragging it?
[23:54:27] <Cork> well they jump, but ya
[23:55:24] <RockinAkin> what?!  how can that be?
[23:55:35] <RockinAkin> i've tested it in firefox and chrome
[23:55:59] <Cork> what's your os?
[23:56:17] <RockinAkin> win 7
[23:56:38] <RockinAkin> are you clicking on either extreme end of the range line?
[23:58:27] <Cork> works in win7 too
[23:58:39] <Cork> so ya, can't reproduce
[23:59:38] <RockinAkin> what the heck
[23:59:54] <Jattenalle> can also confirm it works fine in firefox and chrome
