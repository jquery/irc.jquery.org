[00:00:30] <misterm> eml: but, what is it about that that seems bad to you?
[00:01:15] <eml> misterm: I guess the === and !== operators aren't bad. In eg. C you wouldn't compare strings like that, nor in PHP
[00:01:20] <fraserkillip> is it not that '1' == 1 but '1' === 1 is false?
[00:02:07] <misterm> eml: yea, that's true..but in JS it's what you would do unless you need some sort of fuzzy matching
[00:02:13] <fraserkillip> the == means match regardless of type and === match as well as same type isnt it?
[00:02:36] <misterm> yes, === is stricter and doesn't do type coercion
[00:03:06] <eml> Yep, thanks
[00:06:59] * VorTechS waves
[00:07:02] <VorTechS> hey all
[00:07:40] * WebDragon snores himself awake and waves blearily 
[00:08:11] * VorTechS grins
[00:08:17] <VorTechS> var list = jQuery('#availableSiteList'); var listItem = jQuery(list).find('li#site_' + siteID);
[00:08:19] * WebDragon kick-starts the bottomless coffeepot and waits for the multiple *peRk*GaSmS to start... 
[00:08:52] <VorTechS> any idea why: jQuery(listItem).empty().remove(); only ever works for the first item I try to remove, and no subsequent ones?
[00:08:57] <WebDragon> any particular reason you're using jQuery() instead of $() ?
[00:09:23] <VorTechS> habit ... :)
[00:09:35] <WebDragon> I may be wrong, but ... each() ?
[00:09:54] <VorTechS> no, I don't want to delete them all
[00:10:02] <VorTechS> user selects one, deletes it
[00:10:11] <VorTechS> selects another, goes to delete it - nothing happens
[00:10:16] <WebDragon> ah I see
[00:10:28] <WebDragon> perhaps have it re-scan the list after delete ?
[00:10:28] <VorTechS> but only the first one ever gets removed
[00:11:38] <WebDragon> when you dump listItem to the console before and after the delete, what do you get ?
[00:11:52] * WebDragon kick-starts the bottomless coffeepot and waits for the multiple *peRk*GaSmS to start... 
[00:12:09] * WebDragon * Y A W W N N * s dragonishly
[00:12:13] <VorTechS> well, there's a dialog in between the selection
[00:12:20] <VorTechS> and the deletion
[00:12:32] <VorTechS> and it successfully picks up the listitem the user chose
[00:12:45] <WebDragon> but you still need to know what that array looks like
[00:13:16] <WebDragon> I could really wish for a console that shows actively all the variables in the current namespace, so you can view them as they change
[00:13:40] <WebDragon> so that you can be absolutely sure that they look like what you expect them to look like
[00:15:56] <VorTechS> well the list itself looks like I'd expect ;)
[00:16:04] <VorTechS> correct number of children
[00:16:11] <WebDragon> no null elements
[00:16:16] <VorTechS> nope
[00:16:23] <VorTechS> the one that was removed is gone
[00:16:42] <VorTechS> childnodes/children are in synch
[00:16:49] <WebDragon> so when they go hit the dialog again for the 2nd time, where does it go agley ?
[00:16:56] <WebDragon> does it just fail?
[00:17:11] <WebDragon> anything in the log to explain what happened?
[00:17:36] <VorTechS> it just fails
[00:17:39] <VorTechS> no exceptions
[00:17:59] <VorTechS> log?
[00:19:00] <sasori> need help, how come when I haven't submitted the form, the data is already being input in my db table, need help with ajax :( here's my code http://pastebin.com/0wZx3MgD
[00:19:09] <WebDragon> yeah, like firebug in firefox or Dragonfly in Opera, or whatever they call the debugger in Chrome
[00:19:26] <WebDragon> you can watch the error log when you click through to see what shows up, if anything
[00:20:00] <VorTechS> ah, I'm using firebug ;)
[00:20:03] <VorTechS> nothing in there
[00:20:04] <WebDragon> if nothing shows up there, after the 2nd click-thru that fails, then something _else_ weird is going on
[00:20:20] * VorTechS adds the full source instead of minified to see if he can trace it through
[00:21:07] <WebDragon> it's always fun when it's working with no errors and yet still not doing what you expect it to be doing. usually there's a reason though; you just have to figure out where you made your thinko
[00:21:24] <WarDekar> hey, i'm a jquery newbie and am having trouble figuring out how to capture a keyup event (the = key), I want it to say, just do a javascript alert when = is pressed while the page is active (regardless of where focus is on the page)
[00:21:37] <WebDragon> dump variables to the console all throughout the process, so you can be sure they look like what you expected
[00:22:04] <VorTechS> WebDragon: so far they do and have done ;)
[00:22:19] <WebDragon> yay, more headscratching :)
[00:22:22] <WebDragon> hehehee
[00:23:12] * WebDragon is currently re-learning the new wordpress (been _ages_ since I worked with wp templates -- all manner of fun relearning everything anew)
[00:23:36] <sasori> is there anyone who can/might explain why my code is already inserting data in db even before i submitted the form? http://jsfiddle.net/x3Hwv/1/
[00:23:45] <WarDekar> i see that the = key is #187
[00:24:17] <VorTechS> WebDragon: well, seems that the selector gets lost somewhere
[00:24:20] <VorTechS> remove: function (selector, keepData) {
[00:24:28] <VorTechS> selector == undefined
[00:24:52] <Guest76233> is there any good plugin/app which shows images as tooltips and also shows some regions?(the region's contents are populated using an ajax call)
[00:24:54] <VorTechS> ah no, next coupld of lines negate the need for that
[00:24:55] <VorTechS> hehe
[00:25:59] <nisseni> I'm using jQuery.get to load some content to a DIV - in this DIV I have a link to a rel="shadowbox", I'm able to load the shadowbox.js, but I can't seem to run it, since the link just opens in a new page
[00:29:26] <VorTechS> I'll try and create a JS bin version of this code
[00:29:34] <shellox> how to remove the div container where my button is in?
[00:30:03] <shellox> is there something that it detect in which div its in and delete it on button click?
[00:31:38] <Deele> shellox, you mean, you have DIV with INPUT/BUTTON in it, you want to remote that DIV together with all its contents?
[00:32:14] <Deele> $('.myButton').click(function(){ $(this).closest('div').remove(); });
[00:32:23] <WebDragon> VorTechS: sometimes using jsbin or jsfiddle helps more than you'd expect, because often you're forced to separate out a smaller portion of the logic of the code to make a simpler version -- which then works. and you're left wondering why that one works and then suddenly, enlightenment ensues
[00:32:45] <shellox> Deele: thanks, i will try your code :)
[00:33:39] <Deele> WebDragon, yeah, often just when explaining your problem to another people, you find a problem right away without receiving help, just "thinking seperatly" :)
[00:34:26] <WebDragon> yeah, or having to explain it to someone who has no idea what you're doing forces you to linearize your thinking a little more, and suddenly FOOM, the light goes off, and you're left wondering how you could have missed it
[00:34:35] <Deele> yeah
[00:35:14] <Deele> that is why I like support channels, where asking any dumb questions, is not taken offensive... :)
[00:36:36] <Deele> even more, I like working in team, where I can speak my problem loudly, try to explain...
[00:39:17] <nisseni> I have this function - http://pastie.org/private/nsghqow4yuxzgjvm0epojg - with which I load content to a DIV. I get the shadowbox to load, but I'm not sure how to initialize it - anyone care to help out?
[00:39:22] <shellox> Deele: works fine, looks also better then the way i used before :P
[00:39:56] <Deele> shellox, good for you :)
[00:40:15] <VorTechS> WebDragon: agreed, although extracting out namespace'd stuff to inline JS is a real PITA :D
[00:40:17] <shellox> Deele: and for the others who have to read it later :P
[00:41:16] * WebDragon occasionally has to make heavy use of var_dump in php to see what the hell php thinks is going on
[00:41:38] <Deele> I better like print_r :)
[00:41:48] <WebDragon> and fortunately Perl has an excellent debugger built right in, with all different manner of ways of looking at things
[00:42:01] <WebDragon> yeah, or print_r
[00:42:03] <Deele> or even echo with couple print_r($var,1)  inside
[00:42:30] <shellox> anyone dealed with coffeescript yet?
[00:43:03] <WebDragon> <!-- <? print_r($foo); ?> --> can do wonders for helping you watch the internals without breaking the site visibly
[00:43:29] <WebDragon> doing that in js is a bit more convoluted :)
[00:43:54] <shellox> WebDragon: i use ruby for the web stuff with rails or the sinatra framework ;)
[00:44:16] <Deele> I usually make a function debugMsg($msg) that prints to page a floating DIV with contents inside, with nice red border and yellow background, with incriment, making more debug msg go under each next one, its nice to use transparency effects too :)
[00:44:24] <WebDragon> havent' got at all involved with ruby yet, largely as a consequence of not having any Macs around
[00:44:41] <shellox> you dont need a mac for ruby :P
[00:44:52] <Deele> lol, mac for Ruby
[00:45:16] <WebDragon> no, but I see it most often used there -- almost all the websites I see with various framework bits have Mac screenshots :)
[00:45:17] <shellox> the core devs use macs, but you dont get forced to programm on os x :P
[00:45:33] <Deele> that would be like saying, you can read book if you have pink shelf in apparment...
[00:45:35] <WebDragon> http://compass-style.org/
[00:45:47] <WebDragon> you're missing my point :)
[00:46:09] <WebDragon> I'm thoroughly aware that I already have ruby on my fedora install here
[00:46:15] <shellox> WebDragon: thats true, macs are popular for programming with ruby. also textmate is the prefered text editor for this
[00:46:17] <Deele> any way, this is jQ channel, I suggest flaming around :P
[00:46:33] <Deele> stop*
[00:46:46] <WebDragon> but I've already got jQuery, Perl, PHP, Python, html5 and css3 on my plate
[00:47:12] <Deele> yeah, you are cool...
[00:47:22] <WebDragon> shellox: I've actually found a couple vim scripts to make it function more like textmate -- which can be fun when you're remotely shelled into another server and still able to do all those things
[00:47:35] <WebDragon> someone wrote up an article about it.. sec
[00:47:48] <shellox> well, i like textmate too, but its too expensive
[00:47:58] <WebDragon> http://alexyoung.org/2006/10/22/vim-for-textmate-fans/  there
[00:48:19] <shellox> since lion, a whole operating system costs only 23 euro its really expensive to pay 50 euro for a text editor then :P
[00:48:24] <eml> Cool stuff WebDragon, thanks
[00:48:33] <WebDragon> now you can have all those things, but free (and capable of running in a terminal as well as within gvim :D
[00:48:53] <shellox> WebDragon: i use macvim on osx
[00:48:57] <eml> shellox: Agreed, TM sure costs a lot :/
[00:49:10] <WebDragon> bingo, now you can grab a couple vim plugins and have textmate-like features for free
[00:49:12] <shellox> but it dont feel so smooth as textmate
[00:49:33] * WebDragon buries shellox in a pile of vim plugins
[00:50:29] <shellox> the only problem with macvim is the stability
[00:50:32] <Deele> I am struggling against RoR, cause it needs such a load of stuff, and I can't call seperate scripts, its weird...
[00:50:49] * WebDragon is unsure how macvim is different from simple gvim 
[00:50:53] <shellox> it runs good for a month, but when i really need to get some stuff done it crashes ;)
[00:51:05] * WebDragon has never had vim crash, ever
[00:51:13] <WebDragon> nor gvim
[00:51:42] <WebDragon> might try just using gvim instead -- it's not like, with vim, that you actually NEED menus or anything :D
[00:52:05] <Deele> I need menus, I'm GUI fanatic
[00:52:24] <Deele> I need buttons and mouse interface, that makes job much more faster
[00:52:53] * WebDragon can do all that without taking his hands off the keyboard
[00:52:58] <shellox> charged_bolt: are you the one who also hangup in #sinatra?
[00:53:07] <charged_bolt> Righto :P
[00:53:31] <shellox> ah :)
[00:54:01] <WebDragon> I do _seriously_ miss having the one-and-only-one menubar thing that Apple pioneered with the mac OS
[00:54:03] <nisseni> how can I re-initiate a script in a new element created with jQuery?
[00:54:05] <Deele> WebDragon, yeah, sure, but thinking about some shortcuts, while you have in head 6*20 array of data and whole logic for couple classes and tons of functions in each... better use mouse...
[00:54:13] <WebDragon> each app having its own menubar is an annoyance and a half
[00:54:30] <WebDragon> Deele: that's why I normally use gvim instead of vim :)
[00:54:31] <shellox> os x lion is crap :P
[00:54:53] <WebDragon> I just don't need MENUS for the stuff.. but I do use the mouse to select things on occasion, or just go click to where I need to be
[00:55:11] <Deele> nisseni, create a function that does that in first place, on document ready, call that function, and on creating new elements, call that function again
[00:55:39] <WebDragon> anyway, I gotta read up on this wordpress stuff I'm trying to re-learn, since I'm awake at 3:55 am (hours earlier than normal -- new bed, mattress more firm than I'm used to, backache woke me up. bah. :)
[00:55:45] <shellox> WebDragon: there are still guys who try to convince me that openbox is better as the osx gui :P
[00:55:50] <WebDragon> heh
[00:56:01] <Deele> osx sux :P
[00:56:05] * WebDragon is just happy to have so many window managers to play with on Fedora
[00:56:24] <WebDragon> fortunately osX sucks less than the rest
[00:56:32] <Deele> whole system is made to make user work "OSx way", not the way user wants...
[00:56:43] <shellox> Deele: nope, unix shell + commercial programms are nice
[00:56:46] <lenswipe> coldhead, organ meat. that is all.
[00:56:59] <shellox> and better then work with this microsoft crap
[00:57:10] <WebDragon> not nearly so much so as microsoft's way
[00:57:31] * WebDragon always found the macOS to be far more flexible in getting out of my fucking way and letting me work
[00:57:38] <Deele> MS way has much more freedom
[00:58:07] <shellox> 1. os x 2.linux 3.bsd 4.win ;)
[00:58:11] <WebDragon> ms way is constantly getting in my face and making me futz with it, instead of working with what I want, which has nothing to do with the os or window manager or file manager
[00:58:11] <Deele> with my 18 year experience, I have no problem tuning MS Win in MY WAY :D
[00:59:04] <WebDragon> well maybe you just need to work with the mac more and stop treating it like you treat MS
[00:59:07] <shellox> Deele: well, im a unix guy and it confuses me to see stuff like C: ;)
[00:59:22] <lenswipe> shellox, or BSODs
[00:59:51] <shellox> lenswipe: hehe :)
[01:00:08] <Deele> dont misuse MS, and you wont see any BSODs for years
[01:00:10] <Deele> like I do
[01:00:15] * WebDragon gracefully exits this conversation, needing to study more than needing to discuss whats been beaten to death 12 years ago, back when he'd already been using macs for almost 18 years
[01:00:46] <lenswipe> Deele, clip the "mis" off the beginning of "misuse" and you got it right :)
[01:01:04] * WebDragon started with Mac512K (no 'e') -- 400k floppies. you had to go through 27 disk swaps of 3 floppies to open a file with MS Works (1 os disk, one works disk, and one disk of files)
[01:01:06] <Deele> lenswipe, :)
[01:01:10] <lenswipe> :p
[01:01:22] <Deele> WebDragon, good'ol times... :)
[01:01:27] <shellox> i started with ubuntu as i was 13 or so :P
[01:01:29] <WebDragon> then I got 800k external floppy drive
[01:01:32] <WebDragon> then a macPlus
[01:01:33] <shellox> i never liked windows..
[01:01:36] <WebDragon> then an SE/30
[01:01:39] <WebDragon> and so on
[01:01:40] <sedawk> I have <a>...</a><ul><a>....</a></ul>, how do I get just the <a> not inside <ul>?
[01:01:47] <WebDragon> started with MacOS 3.2 back in the day (1987)
[01:02:32] <sedawk> can anyone help me?
[01:02:39] <misterm> sedawk: sorrry, do you mean you want the <a> that is outside the ul
[01:02:45] <WebDragon> back when you had to PRINT a file from WordPerfect before you could possibly know what it would look like
[01:02:47] <sedawk> yes
[01:02:50] <misterm> sedawk: or you want the <a> that is inside the <ul> to be moved outside
[01:03:02] <WebDragon> (from wordperfect on ms-dos)
[01:03:02] <sedawk> <a> outside <ul>
[01:03:04] <WebDragon> that is
[01:03:18] <WebDragon> I keep saying I'm gonna go and then I don't go.
[01:03:25] * WebDragon goes for real this time LOL :D
[01:03:29] <misterm> sedawk: well it's sort of hard to say just from that little snippet
[01:03:44] <shellox> i hate it to optimize sites for ie6..
[01:04:09] <misterm> sedawk: based purely on the code you pasted, it would be something like $("a").first()
[01:04:14] <nisseni> Deele: this is what I got: http://pastie.org/private/g3o0lszdit2e8rdktp0mfq - the Shadowbox.init is what I need to do - but I'm very novice in this, can't figure out where to init it...
[01:06:37] <Deele> nisseni, havent used Shadowbox and I'm not fluent in JavaScript objects and stuff
[01:06:57] <VorTechS> okay, unsurprisingly jsBin shows it to work correctly when I remove the dialog in between
[01:07:02] * VorTechS goes for a meeting
[01:07:18] <misterm> nisseni: whats the problem?
[01:07:29] <sedawk> thank you misterm
[01:07:38] <nisseni> misterm: I get the script to load, but not sure how to initialize it
[01:07:56] <nisseni> misterm: it's all in a new element
[01:08:35] <Hierofant> call the function?
[01:09:03] <nisseni> Hierofant: at me?
[01:09:15] <misterm> nisseni: what about in the callback function of getScript?
[01:09:16] <Hierofant> yes
[01:09:17] <Hierofant> Shadowbox.init({     handleOversize: "drag", modal: true  });
[01:09:29] <nisseni> Hierofant: but where do I do that?
[01:10:08] <Hierofant>  nisseni in your document head
[01:10:58] <nisseni> Hierofant: but my function is loading a new element, and it's already initialized in the document head, not sure how to re-init it...
[01:11:14] <Hierofant> what?
[01:11:27] <Hierofant> just call the function in the head of the actual real document
[01:11:51] <Hierofant> shadowbox doesn't function at the element level, it functions at the document level
[01:13:49] <nisseni> Hierofant: but it's already loaded on the document level
[01:13:49] <sprezzatura> any good tooltip plugin suggestions?
[01:14:06] <sprezzatura> i want to display content fetched dynamically
[01:15:17] <Hierofant> nisseni then call it!
[01:15:51] <Hierofant> shadowbox.init function goes in the head
[01:16:01] <nisseni> Hierofant: it's already in the head
[01:16:06] <Hierofant> have you made a plain vanilla shadowbox document yet?
[01:16:10] <nisseni> so why isn't it working?
[01:16:11] <Hierofant> maybe you should do that
[01:16:18] <Hierofant> because you aren't attaching a handler
[01:16:21] <Hierofant> .init is .init
[01:16:22] <nisseni> Hierofant: it works outside the new element...
[01:16:26] <Hierofant> initialization, getting it ready
[01:16:44] <Hierofant> why isn't your new element doing it the same way as the rest of the working elements?
[01:17:06] <nisseni> because the new element is loaded after the document is loaded
[01:17:24] <nisseni> it's loaded with jQuery.get
[01:17:49] <Hierofant> wheres the jquery bot
[01:18:10] <Hierofant> ?live
[01:18:11] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[01:18:36] <Hierofant> ?live @ nisseni
[01:18:37] <bot-t> nisseni, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[01:28:19] <mazzachre> I have a problem with jquerymobile, anyone know how I can make a page element regenerate every time it is navigated to instead of just the first time?
[01:30:06] <munderwo> Hi all, im using jqplot and im getting a jQuery.cleanData is not a function? using jquery 1.4.4 .. any ideas?
[01:32:27] <munderwo> dont worry... it cant handle a string as an axis.. fair enough... just a bit cryptic on the error message
[01:34:59] <nisseni> Hierofant: I did lke this: http://pastie.org/private/b66xhoipquumqmraicme2a - am I even close to where I want to go?
[01:35:42] <misterm> nisseni: did you try my suggestion?
[01:36:37] <nisseni> misterm: I think I tried that earlier - I get the idea, but not sure about the syntax...
[01:37:04] <misterm> nisseni: check the docs for getScript
[01:37:27] <misterm> nisseni: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[01:37:55] <misterm> nisseni: why are you loading shadowbox dynamically anyway?
[01:38:25] <nisseni> misterm: because I'm loading new data into a div with jQuery.get
[01:39:21] <misterm> nisseni: yea, but why not load shadowbox before that?
[01:39:51] <nisseni> misterm: it's already loaded, but I think I'd have to reinitialize it to work with the new element
[01:39:56] <misterm> nisseni: and then just call shadowbox.init() after the new data is loaded
[01:39:58] <nisseni> misterm: it works outside the element
[01:40:51] <misterm> nisseni: did you try just calling init again after loading the new stuff?
[01:42:13] <nisseni> misterm: like this you mean? http://pastie.org/private/moz8j33u8higefwzvxsva
[01:44:51] <misterm> nisseni: no, because that's not calling init when the new stuff is loaded
[01:45:28] <nisseni> misterm: sorry, as I stated earlier, I don't have much knowledge with this, I'm working on an app that was created 2 years ago
[01:45:55] <misterm> nisseni: what does this line do: jQuery('#box_content').html(data);
[01:46:19] <nisseni> misterm: guess it loads the data :)
[01:46:31] <misterm> ok, and you want shadowbox to initialize right after that, right?
[01:46:46] <misterm> so how would you make it so the very next thing that happens after that is shadowbox initializing?
[01:47:09] <Hierofant> haha @ hhofstaetter
[01:47:49] <nisseni> misterm: http://pastie.org/private/boekwwytbtqiq37g02deyg - that's how I would do it
[01:48:19] <misterm> nisseni: yes, does that work?
[01:48:26] <nisseni> misterm: nope
[01:49:32] <misterm> nisseni: ok, you'll have to read the Shadowbox documentation to see how to deal with new content
[01:50:19] <misterm> nisseni: it may be that you need to reload the entire script again, but that strikes me as a very bad way to do it and I would see if theres another way first
[01:50:35] <nisseni> misterm: I've tried that as well
[01:51:43] <misterm> nisseni: did you try calling init after the script was reloaded?
[01:51:51] <nisseni> misterm: yep
[01:51:52] <misterm> nisseni: that is, in a callback in getScript
[01:52:38] <Hierofant> nisseni - did you try what I suggested?
[01:52:57] <misterm> nisseni: you tried it in a callback in getScript? yea, you'll have to go to the shadowbox website and read the docs/contact them for help
[01:53:15] <Hierofant> this isnt a shadowbox problem
[01:53:19] <nisseni> Hierofant: http://pastie.org/private/b66xhoipquumqmraicme2a - am I even close to where I want to go?
[01:53:25] <Hierofant> this is a jquery problem
[01:53:36] <Hierofant> nisseni I'm not looking at that till you talk to me
[01:53:40] <heatxsink> i'm trying to get x and y coordinates for the touchstart event ... has anyone else out there done this?
[01:53:52] <nisseni> Hierofant: yes, that's what I came up with of your suggestion
[01:54:15] <Hierofant> nisseni try again.
[01:54:18] <Hierofant> ?live @ nisseni
[01:54:19] <bot-t> nisseni, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[01:54:31] <Hierofant> nisseni - that's for you
[01:57:35] <misterm> nisseni: what exactly is not working in the new content?
[01:57:48] <nisseni> misterm: rel="shadowbox"
[01:58:10] <pavan> hi
[01:58:15] <Hierofant> nisseni is that term showing up in the parsed HTML?
[01:58:25] <misterm> nisseni: I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean
[01:58:28] <Hierofant> send a link
[01:58:45] <misterm> Hierofant: what are you suggesting is put in the live listener?
[01:58:52] <misterm> Hierofant: did they post more code earlier or something?
[01:59:19] <Hierofant> misterm shouldn't the handler be attached to the .live() for persistent assignment?
[01:59:34] <Hierofant> because its missing from nisseni's markup
[01:59:35] <nisseni> Hierofant: I can see now that I have an old version of jQuery
[01:59:39] <misterm> Hierofant: what handler?
[01:59:44] <pavan> http://jsfiddle.net/uRfpe/
[01:59:49] <Hierofant> the handler that calls the function
[01:59:56] <pavan> Do you guys see anything wrong with 2nd line
[02:00:01] <nisseni> 1.1.2 - so I don't think live exists
[02:00:01] <misterm> Hierofant: can you be more specific? which function?
[02:00:03] <Hierofant> nisseni send a link
[02:00:13] <pavan> some how if I comment out second line everything works fine
[02:00:17] <nisseni> Hierofant: it's local system :S
[02:00:18] <Hierofant> the shadowbox function, misterm
[02:00:28] <misterm> Hierofant: you mean the init() function?
[02:00:51] <nisseni> Hierofant: is it risky to upgrade jquery?
[02:01:03] <misterm> Hierofant: .live() just delegates the listener, I'm not sure it will help here
[02:01:04] <Hierofant> nisseni - is rel="shadowbox" showing up in your parsed, dynamic markup?
[02:01:14] <Hierofant> ok
[02:01:35] <nisseni> Hierofant: it's in the <a>
[02:01:40] <misterm> nisseni: can you explain more specifically what is not working about the new content?
[02:01:52] <Hierofant> ok nisseni what happens when you click it?
[02:02:04] <nisseni> Hierofant: it just opens in a new page
[02:02:08] <misterm> nisseni: what do you expect to happen, and what actually happens
[02:02:09] <Hierofant> or whatever the user is supposed to do
[02:02:40] <Hierofant> nisseni and the link looks the same as the others?
[02:02:43] <Hierofant> paste that code.
[02:02:50] <djQuery> http://jsplumb.org/jquery/demo.html
[02:02:51] <nisseni> misterm: the new content is generating link to history of an entity, when I click the entity I'm supposed to get a shadowbox with the history, but I get it on a new page instead
[02:03:16] <Hierofant> djQuerythanks
[02:03:33] <djQuery> Hierofant: just something I thought was cool
[02:03:40] <misterm> nisseni: have you read the shadowbox documentation?
[02:03:43] <is_null> hi all, does blur happen before click ?
[02:03:53] <djQuery> gonna be using it here to represent foriegn keys
[02:03:55] <pavan> djQuery: anything wrong with 2nd line - http://jsfiddle.net/uRfpe/
[02:04:18] <djQuery> depends on what this is
[02:04:20] <nisseni> Hierofant: http://pastie.org/private/enyq9cthoojgcr7o1imljq
[02:04:33] <is_null> in my blur function, how can i know if the user clicked in a certain element ?
[02:05:08] <Hierofant> nisseni I only see one shadowbox link there
[02:05:08] <misterm> nisseni: if you'd read the shadowbox documentation like I suggested, you'll find there is a method to setup the links to work with shadowbox manually
[02:05:20] <noob> morning people
[02:05:24] <misterm> nisseni: rather than using rel="shadowbox" inside the markup
[02:05:28] <nisseni> misterm: will check that up
[02:05:30] <pavan> I am just trying to submit a form using ajax
[02:05:32] <noob> i am tryign to create a tree in a page view
[02:05:45] <noob> i have divided the page into 2 panes
[02:05:48] <noob> left and right

[02:07:18] <Hierofant> nisseni - yes I see the loop, I thought you said one of them wasn't working and it was the dynamic one.  Is that not correct?
[02:07:28] <noob> i asked the question bot t
[02:07:32] <noob> bot-t
[02:07:42] <misterm> nisseni: according to the shadowbox docs, you should only call shadowbox.init() once on page load, the rest you can handle with shadowbox.open() and shadowbox.setup()
[02:07:44] <noob> its up there with link
[02:07:51] <nisseni> Hierofant: none of them is working :S

[02:08:25] <Hierofant> nisseni so as I said before, you should build a working, vanilla html version of Shadowbox yourself.
[02:08:31] <charged_bolt> how old are you noob ?

[02:09:32] <djQuery> noob: or are we supposed to wade through all that crap as well
[02:09:36] <is_null> djQuery: thanks, is there any way to know where the user clicked in the blur callback ?
[02:09:38] * djQuery 13
[02:09:42] <Whirl3d> imgonna puke
[02:09:48] <Mateo__> i have a simple script that set the size of 4 blocks to the size of the heighest. It works well enough, but when i use CTRL + F5 to refresh the page, the script isn't use anymore.. any idea please ?
[02:09:48] <charged_bolt> but you are funny :)
[02:10:00] <noob> djQuery sorry but i din get you
[02:10:04] <djQuery> is_null: not unless u have the future plugin installed
[02:10:32] <is_null> djQuery: where is it ?
[02:10:39] <Whirl3d> Mateo__ this is a perfect time to post your code to jsfiddle.net
[02:10:42] <noob> i am using jsfiddle for the first time so dont know if theres a better way
[02:10:45] <Hierofant> nisseni what's the parsed code look like?
[02:11:00] <is_null> google.com/search?q=jquery+future+plugin is no use
[02:11:12] <noob> i think the error is in html page
[02:11:46] <djQuery> is_null: because u will need a timemachine to go forward couple 10000000 years to find it
[02:12:01] <Whirl3d> lol
[02:12:08] <djQuery> is_null: blur cant tell u what they clicked on because it hasnt happened yet
[02:12:15] <nisseni> Hierofant: http://pastie.org/private/cwy3doxyvmh41oyra97jxq
[02:12:36] <superos> Can someone explain to me why function fff in line 1 execute at once (on page load) while anonymous functions in line 3 execute on click of my element ? http://dpaste.org/cfrv/  I want both to execute on click.
[02:12:44] <noob> ?ask @noob
[02:12:44] <bot-t> noob, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:12:57] * djQuery hmmmmm theres a wayback for the interweb wonder if there is a wayforward?
[02:13:03] <Hierofant> nisseni - for starters, your HTML is invalid.
[02:13:05] <whitman> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3726166/test/index.html - In Chrome the 'after' width and height are always 0, where as in Firefox they are 0 if a force refresh is performed but correct if the image is loaded from cache.  Why?
[02:13:11] <Hierofant> nisseni - Validate it first
[02:13:17] <nisseni> Hierofant: doesn't matter at all
[02:13:19] <Hierofant> then get back to us
[02:13:24] <Hierofant> orly
[02:13:35] <Hierofant> I had a shadowbox error b/c of nonvalidating code.
[02:13:40] <Hierofant> have had
[02:13:40] <is_null> djQuery: you can see my problem on the autocomplete on this page: http://bet.yourlabs.org/ bluring the input hides the suggestions box, so i can't trigger a click on any option from the suggestion box
[02:13:59] <Hierofant> work on that file, your output file.
[02:13:59] <Whirl3d> superos, I think your problem is in how you wrote the handler in the first line.
[02:14:20] <Whirl3d> superos, you need to encapsulate that in an anonymous function...like:
[02:14:41] <Whirl3d> ly_text.click(function () {fff("ly")});
[02:14:42] <KuW8t> i need a way to load a youtube video in a div. and the link must be supportet by a option select klick.
[02:14:53] <djQuery> is_null: hmmmmm betcha that without clicking on the link you are recreateing the wheel and not using the see ?ui.autocomplete
[02:14:54] <bot-t> is_null, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[02:14:55] <superos> Whirl3d: Thanks, let me try.
[02:15:08] <noob> djQuery w/o the javascript    http://jsfiddle.net/nJAfR/1/
[02:15:25] <noob> ?ui.autocomplete
[02:15:25] <bot-t> The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[02:15:28] <Hierofant> nisseni - Why is it shadowbox[1]?
[02:15:31] <Hierofant> in the function
[02:15:37] <Whirl3d> KuW8t, try videoforeveryone
[02:15:39] <Hierofant> err the rel=
[02:15:49] <nisseni> Hierofant: to be honest, I don't know, as I said, I'm working with an existing system
[02:15:56] <KuW8t> Whirl3d: what is that?
[02:16:11] <djQuery> is_null: if you insist on recreating the wheel dont hide it in the click do a settimeout instead. on the hover of your autocomplete list do a cancel timeout and on mouseout of the list do the same settimeout
[02:16:14] <Hierofant> nisseni - is there a special version of shadowbox on this existing system?
[02:16:21] <Whirl3d> It's a system that lets you embed video in a number of easy ways so that it works on all platforms
[02:16:28] <Hierofant> such as, perhaps, one that doesn't work in your browser?
[02:16:38] <nisseni> Hierofant: I don't think so - I just copied the link
[02:16:40] <Hierofant> or perhaps you reinstalled shadowbox.js?
[02:16:46] <Hierofant> no? ok
[02:16:53] <nisseni> Hierofant: as I said before, it works perfectly outside the new element
[02:16:53] <noob> theres a very small issue
[02:16:58] <Hierofant> try without [1] see what happens
[02:16:58] <noob> but i can not figure out in my html

[02:18:14] <noob> right div not visible when i expand left div
[02:18:38] <KuW8t> Whirl3d: did they use jquery in this solution?
[02:18:38] <djQuery> ?lmgtfy videoforeveryone

[02:18:50] <Whirl3d> lol
[02:19:06] <superos> Whirl3d: First test seems to work. Thanks a lot. But what is the logic behind that anonymous functions does not get called at once like vanilla functions do?
[02:19:17] <Whirl3d> To be honest, I can't even remember.
[02:19:22] <nisseni> Hierofant: still the same
[02:19:47] <is_null> djQuery: i'm not, jquery ui autocomplete doesn't fit my needs: custom design in the suggestions box, and high performance
[02:19:50] <Hierofant> nisseni time for you to read all about how to properly implement shadowbox.  http://www.shadowbox-js.com/usage.html
[02:20:03] <KuW8t> Whirl3d: you are joking.. sad
[02:20:18] <is_null> ahhh i see !! great idea !! thanks djQuery
[02:20:23] <Mateo__> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/hzzzN/   that's not working on this page lol, but the code is there
[02:20:26] <Whirl3d> I think the logic is that the item inside the () is evaluated at runtime. If it's an anon function, it defers the evaluation until needed. Otherwise it evaluates it immediately. Hence the running right away
[02:21:30] <Whirl3d> Mateo__, refresh me. What's the problem you are having?
[02:21:31] <djQuery> is_null: see ?ui.autocomple #custom-data

[02:22:20] <Mateo__> Whirl3d: i have a simple script that set the size of 4 blocks to the size of the heighest. It works well enough, but when i use CTRL + F5 to refresh the page, the script isn't use anymore
[02:22:39] <is_null> djQuery: not custom data, custom *rendering*, ie. rendering that is way different from jquery ui theme
[02:22:49] <Whirl3d> You need to include a resize handler. That should fix it
[02:23:02] <Whirl3d> $(window).resize(function () {do you alignment here});
[02:23:10] <charged_bolt> yes, I do
[02:23:26] <Hekim> Hello.
[02:23:49] <Hierofant> instantly creepy
[02:23:54] <Hekim> I'm looking for a jQuery (or UI) plugin that will allow me to pick date and time into a single field in a format I specify.
[02:23:56] <Mateo__> Whirl3d: ok, i'm going to read the doc of that function :) thanks ! i will tell you if that works
[02:24:31] <mazzachre> Hekim: The datepicker element have a plugin that also deals with time... the format is settable in the config element
[02:24:48] <Whirl3d> Mateo___ like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/X7QnQ/1/
[02:25:04] <Hekim> mazzachre, Do you have a link/reference?
[02:25:10] <mazzachre> Whirl3d: The logic is also that a function can return a function, so you can make higher order functions to return event handlers... But seldomly used...
[02:25:48] <mazzachre> Hekim: You know this great page called google? It tells you almost everything in the world! Also, you can find it in the plugins part of jqueryui... it also have a search function!
[02:27:22] <Whirl3d> mazzachre, thanks for the input. Good to know.
[02:28:15] <djQuery> Hekim: there is a date format option in see ?ui.datepicker
[02:28:15] <bot-t> Hekim, The jQuery UI Datepicker is a highly configurable plugin that adds datepicker functionality to your pages. http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[02:28:26] <djQuery> but you cant pick the time
[02:28:40] <Hekim> I'm aware of datepicker - this doesn't help me with time though :P
[02:29:06] <djQuery> http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[02:29:07] <mazzachre> As said... someone (find on google, I did some time ago) added a time handler for datepicker
[02:31:05] <Whirl3d> If I have 5 pages that I am loading via ajax and each page has a custom script that needs to be run before it is displayed, how do I make that happen without a giant if tree or switch statement?
[02:31:16] <Mateo__> Whirl3d: not working, still the same problem ...

[02:31:56] <Hekim> lol djQuery
[02:32:06] <Hekim> The best I've found so far is http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[02:32:11] <Whirl3d> Funny, mine only works on refresh. When I run it in Chrome, it loads weird, but ctrl-f5 clears it up.
[02:32:29] <Mateo__> Whirl3d: strange :)
[02:32:31] <nisseni> is it a big risk in upgrading jquery? can old scripts get unusable?
[02:32:46] <Cork> nisseni: mostly its plugins that break
[02:32:58] <nisseni> Cork: ok, thanks
[02:33:00] <djQuery> Hekim: funny that is the first onethat google turns up as well
[02:33:11] <Cork> nisseni: but ya, scripts can break, jqueryui is more likly then jquery though
[02:33:11] <tuxx-> hi guise. I've got a webpage which is generated by jquery grid, it shows all the days of the year in checkboxes. This is so that people can check which days they work, and which days they dont work. But the performance is horrible, i've disabled the ajax calls when clicking a checkbox, and the performance is still horrible. Is it advisable to have a page with so many checkboxes on a page?
[02:33:21] <djQuery> Whirl3d: create an array?
[02:33:27] <Hekim> Yes - I was not keen on it, and asked hoping there would be a more widely used/nicer solution
[02:33:37] <djQuery> have the page return the name of the function that needs to be run?
[02:33:42] <mazzachre> For mobile jquery How to refresh an entire page? Refreshing the list element does not refresh it's children (Buttons in the list) Or is it possible to force that?
[02:34:58] <Whirl3d> djQuery, I'd like to figure out how to do something like var funcName= "init"+pageName..  funcName();
[02:35:25] <Whirl3d> I am having a problem turning a string literal into a function
[02:37:00] <djQuery> superos: do you know about chaining?   and that css can take an object?   $('#overlay').css({top, viewportHeight/3, left: viewportWidth/3, etc}).html().fadeIn(). etc.....
[02:38:13] <nisseni> Hierofant: well, reading, applying, but can't get it to work...
[02:39:02] <Hierofant> on the .html?
[02:39:12] <Hierofant> or are you still messing with php?
[02:39:27] <Hierofant> the .php file I mean
[02:39:47] <nisseni> Hierofant: huh? well, I figured out what [1] is - it's the gallery
[02:40:02] <Hierofant> ok
[02:40:07] <Hierofant> BTW, are your links found?
[02:40:34] <Mateo__> Whirl3d:  window["functionName"]() do the trick
[02:40:43] <Hierofant> when you click and it loads a new window, is the window blank or 404?
[02:40:49] <Hierofant> nisseni
[02:41:41] <nisseni> Hierofant: it loads what it's supposed to be loading
[02:42:54] <Hierofant> ok
[02:43:11] <Hierofant> heh freewifia.sydneyairport.com.au
[02:43:32] <misterm> nisseni: can you listen for clicks on the links?
[02:43:42] <djQuery> nisseni: so whats the issue then
[02:43:52] <nisseni> djQuery: it doesn't open in the shadowbox
[02:44:10] <misterm> nisseni: try just attaching a click listener
[02:44:32] <djQuery> $('a').click(functin(e){e.preventDefault(); the rest o ur code.});
[02:44:46] <djQuery> nisseni: see ?.preventdefault
[02:44:46] <bot-t> nisseni, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:44:49] <sasori> question: is the data paramater of the $.ajax space sensitive ?. like e.g when having too many data to pass, it should only be in one single line? or i can move to new lines ?
[02:44:52] <misterm> nisseni: for right now, just try firing an alert or something
[02:45:09] <misterm> nisseni: if that works try using shadowbox.open() inside the click listener
[02:45:43] <Hierofant> yeah nisseni
[02:45:50] <Hierofant> what misterm said :)
[02:46:47] <djQuery> misterm: Hierofant: nisseni: if you dont prevent the link from being followed it doesnt matter what you do in the click handler.
[02:47:14] <nisseni> got it working now
[02:47:17] <djQuery>  $('a').click(functin(e){e.preventDefault(); shadowbox.open(););
[02:47:30] <nisseni> by making a function that opens it, then making an onclick="" in a button
[02:47:39] <nisseni> doesn't look pretty I guess, but works!
[02:47:41] <misterm> djQuery: not sure why you're telling me this
[02:48:01] <djQuery> nisseni: got a link?
[02:48:09] <nisseni> djQuery: no, working locally
[02:48:37] <misterm> nisseni: a function that opens what?
[02:48:48] <nisseni> misterm: that opens the shadowbox
[02:49:21] <Hierofant> djQuery  - don't need to prevent default with Shadowbox
[02:50:10] <misterm> nisseni: you mean you have a button to click to open the shadowbox?
[02:50:12] <zmijunkie> hi
[02:50:21] <misterm> nisseni: and you're using "onclick=''" in the markup?
[02:51:16] <nisseni> misterm: http://pastie.org/private/4npblxgyhnbckaw9jlfycq
[02:52:48] <misterm> nisseni: why not just use the link?
[02:53:59] <nisseni> misterm: in the onclick?
[02:54:05] <misterm> nisseni: do something like <a href = "/history/complete/<?php echo $entity['Entity']['id'] ?>" class = "opener">foobar</a>
[02:54:35] <nisseni> misterm: but this works excellent...? :)
[02:54:51] <misterm> nisseni: if you want to keep it all kudlgy, suit yourself
[02:55:26] <nisseni> kudlgy?
[02:55:41] <misterm> *kludgy
[02:55:43] <djQuery> nisseni: generaly jquery people think that doing onclick="whatever" sucks
[02:55:57] <misterm> I don't think I'd say "jquery people"
[02:56:06] <misterm> but more like "professional web developers"
[02:56:16] <misterm> or just "web developers"
[02:56:17] <djQuery> and I agree
[02:56:51] <misterm> plus I'm not sure about the button
[02:57:24] <eml> Whoop! Arrived in the mail today: Eloquent Ruby & The Rails 3 Way
[02:57:55] <Whirl3d> cool. was it on 8" or 5 1/4" discs
[02:58:09] <eml> Woot
[02:58:28] <djQuery> nisseni: taking misterm example   $('a.opener').click(function(e){e.preventDefault();  Shadowbox.open(content: this.url, 'ifram', 'Historik'); })
[02:58:36] <eml> oh, wrong channel :D
[02:59:40] <djQuery> well I messed up the options but u should get hte idea
[03:00:25] <charged_bolt> eml: can you email me that ?
[03:01:29] <nisseni> djQuery: thing is, I'm such novice in jquery, that I don't even know where to put that
[03:02:06] <djQuery> inside a script tag at the bottom of the doc would be good.
[03:02:21] <misterm> djQuery: the problem is those links are created dynamically
[03:02:27] <misterm> so really a live would be better
[03:02:44] <misterm> nisseni: or you can use djQuery's code, put it right after you load the new html
[03:03:02] <eml> charged_bolt: :-(
[03:03:10] <misterm> nisseni: remember that line you have where it's like $().html() ? you'd put it after that
[03:04:01] <djQuery> or just $(document).ready(function(){ $('a.opener').live('click',function(e){e.preventDefault();  Shadowbox.open(content: this.url, 'ifram', 'Historik');  }});
[03:04:23] <djQuery> nisseni: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ or this can go anywhere on the page
[03:04:33] <djQuery> well a script tag anywhere ont eh page
[03:04:46] <djQuery> ?jqf@ nisseni
[03:04:47] <bot-t> nisseni, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[03:05:44] <djQuery> nisseni: first couple charpters should get u started
[03:06:47] <superos> djQuery: Thanks for the tip.
[03:06:58] <djQuery> np
[03:07:53] <djQuery> superos: and if you just put all that in a css class it would probably be easier.
[03:09:10] <djQuery> instead of the viewport/3 stuff you could just use 33.3% and set the body, html {width: 100%; height: 100%;}
[03:10:50] <nisseni> djQuery: thanks...
[03:17:38] <owzzz> hi, does anyone have much experience using the twitter api?
[03:17:58] <owzzz> i can seem to pull the correct tweets when using the following url http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=from%3Asustrans+%40freerangekids&rpp=2
[03:18:16] <misterm> owzzz: is this a question that relates directly to jQuery?
[03:18:43] <owzzz> im using the getJson method to return the tweets
[03:19:01] <misterm> owzzz: and what's the problem?
[03:20:00] <owzzz> basically when Im filtering I cannot get results back using the query above which looks for tweets with the hashtag freerangekids and the tweet needs to be submitted by the user sustrans
[03:20:24] <misterm> owzzz: can you put up a jsfiddle with your code?
[03:20:27] <owzzz> if I use them independantly I get tweets back. It's only when I combine them do I get 0 results
[03:20:55] <misterm> owzzz: that sounds like an issue with the twitter api
[03:22:52] <misterm> owzzz: I'd read the twitter api docs/check stack overflow/ a more general programming channel #...unless you think your problem is *directly* related to jQuery
[03:26:28] <juria_roberts> I got a div which has a spinner and also shows the message however when i do $("divid").text("") the spinner tag dissapears how do I avoid this?
[03:27:07] <misterm> juria_roberts: don't overwrite it?
[03:27:19] <Whirl3d> $("#divid").html(just the spinner code)
[03:27:29] <coldhead> ?csb
[03:27:30] <bot-t> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[03:27:44] <juria_roberts> Whirl3d: ill try that
[03:28:09] <Whirl3d> That is a cool story bro. lol
[03:28:54] <juria_roberts> isnt bot-t a bot?
[03:28:57] <Whirl3d> coldhead, is that you?
[03:29:23] <bobdobbs> I'm having trouble debugging a behaviour from a jquery plugin. My code looks like this:
[03:29:27] <bobdobbs> http://jsfiddle.net/9VCNX/1/
[03:29:31] <Whirl3d> not just any bot, he's bot-t
[03:30:05] <bobdobbs> I've plugged in something called animate-colors.js. Its from here
[03:30:12] <bobdobbs> http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[03:30:15] <juria_roberts> bot-t: can u chat with me?
[03:30:16] <bot-t> juria_roberts, Reply hazy, try again.
[03:30:28] <juria_roberts> Reply hazy?
[03:30:44] <bobdobbs> Now, when I try some lines from the console, I get predictable, favourable results.
[03:31:35] <bobdobbs> But when I try to apply the animate function to the background color, I get the error "begin is undefined"
[03:32:48] <bobdobbs> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/652335/
[03:33:23] <bobdobbs> anyone have an idea what could be going on here ?
[03:33:48] <bobdobbs> I seem to only get errors when trying to animate the 'backgroundColor' property.
[03:34:04] <bobdobbs> All other sensible tests pass and the animation occours.
[03:35:12] <Whirl3d> I think there's a plugin for background color animation. But you might just want to make an inset div filled with a color and keep in the background. Then you can animate
[03:36:26] <bobdobbs> In my live code I'm using the plugin for color animations. It's this one here:
[03:36:27] <bobdobbs> http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[03:37:22] <bobdobbs> I've considered using sibling divs with absolute positioning, but that can be a pain to mentally manage and debug
[03:38:52] <Whirl3d> in your fiddle, there's no animate call
[03:39:12] <coldhead> that's what she said
[03:39:14] <creati29> hi can anyone tell me, is it ok to add analytic code in an external js file, i want to upload it to a large number of pages and would rather do this than add each manually
[03:39:39] <bobdobbs> Whirl3d: I'm uploading all of that demo code now onto a real host, so it's easier to look at...
[03:41:31] <coldhead> creati29: you probably need to add it to 2 separate files for it to work
[03:41:33] <coldhead> ?tias
[03:41:34] <bot-t> Try It And See
[03:41:43] <coldhead> but also this is a better question for google than #jQuery
[03:42:22] <bobdobbs> coldhead: were you directing that towards me
[03:42:40] <coldhead> no bobdobbs, we're tight
[03:43:13] <bobdobbs> all good... I don't mind being directed towards more appropriate places...
[03:43:14] <misterm>  are you mr bob dobalina?
[03:43:19] <bobdobbs> hehe
[03:43:24] <bobdobbs> I remember that song
[03:43:25] <Whirl3d> works for me
[03:43:27] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/cvzZt/2/
[03:43:39] <bobdobbs> I believe the character in that song refers to my namesake
[03:44:07] <misterm> got slack?
[03:44:17] <bobdobbs> misterm: all of it
[03:44:39] <creati29> this room answers all questions :P
[03:45:00] <Whirl3d> by referring you to google
[03:45:04] <coldhead> what is the answer to this question?
[03:45:08] <bobdobbs> Whirl3d: I see that you've got working... but here is the thing that gets me...
[03:45:37] <bobdobbs> I can animate some properties, but only get an error when I do backgroundColor
[03:45:43] <Whirl3d> coldehead, 42 if I remember correctly
[03:45:57] <bobdobbs> Whirl3d: oh sorry
[03:46:05] <bobdobbs> I see that that's in the fiddle code
[03:46:25] <creati29> Whirl3d: lol
[03:46:37] <bobdobbs> sorry
[03:46:43] <Whirl3d> np
[03:47:24] <Whirl3d> My roommate just made a stuffed oven pancake. Gotta go eat breakfast. be back later.
[03:47:31] <bobdobbs> enjoy noms
[03:47:46] <bobdobbs> I'll take a closer look at my code and see what I'm donig wrong
[03:49:47] <creati29> see, asking the question in #google just generates tumbleweeds
[03:51:58] <Whirl3d> or #tumbleweeeds
[03:52:35] <creati29> you ate breakfast quickly!
[03:52:43] <Whirl3d> still cooking....
[03:52:46] <Whirl3d> 8(
[03:52:47] <creati29> lol
[03:57:17] <bobdobbs> I still haven't quiet figured out what I'm doing wrong/differently...
[03:57:29] <bobdobbs> Here is the actual page on working on:
[03:57:31] <bobdobbs> http://testing.sunil.co.nz/
[03:57:49] <bobdobbs> I'm using the effect for a hover over the nav items
[03:58:13] <bobdobbs> at the moment, if I hover over the nav, I get the 'undefined' error in firebug
[04:00:27] <bobdobbs> The failure happens at line 14 of my gogos.js
[04:00:37] <bluenavajo> hello guys
[04:01:03] <bluenavajo> has anybody experience with jquery tools?
[04:01:30] <bluenavajo> especially the scrollable component
[04:02:31] <misterm> bluenavajo: if you have a question, just go ahead and ask it
[04:03:09] <bluenavajo> ok, the scrollable has the ability to add an item at the end, but i want to add it ontop.
[04:03:19] <noob> misterm i am back
[04:03:24] <noob> figured that out
[04:03:26] <noob> :D
[04:03:31] <noob> it was width issue
[04:03:32] <misterm> noob: good to hear
[04:03:33] <bobdobbs> bluenavajo: you want a vertical scrollable?
[04:03:46] <bluenavajo> yes, i allready have one
[04:03:58] <noob> can you help me with this issue
[04:04:03] <noob> this is small code and precise
[04:04:05] <noob> http://pastie.org/2273383
[04:04:12] <noob> when i click node 1 here
[04:04:29] <noob> on line 4
[04:04:36] <noob> i need row in table to be displayed
[04:04:42] <noob> that is row 64 in this pastie
[04:04:45] <bluenavajo> can i simply add the element to the dom via jquery or does tools not recognize this?
[04:04:46] <noob> how do i do this
[04:04:48] <noob> any idea
[04:05:16] <misterm> noob: add a click listener?
[04:05:37] <noob> okay never heard of it
[04:05:42] <noob> will research though
[04:06:04] <bluenavajo> bobdobbs: did you do something similar before?
[04:06:36] <bobdobbs> yeah. I've used jquery tools, and scrollable
[04:06:53] <bobdobbs> but I'm not quiet sure what you are trying to do.
[04:06:57] <bobdobbs> and I'm no expert
[04:07:16] <noob> can you give me an example by any chance in this piece of code?
[04:07:26] <bobdobbs> an example of what?
[04:07:45] <noob> http://pastie.org/2273383
[04:07:50] <bluenavajo> i want to look this like the news feed on foursquare.com
[04:07:59] <bluenavajo> for instance
[04:08:03] <noob> if i click node 1 i want row 1 on line 64
[04:08:10] <noob> to be displayed
[04:08:26] <bluenavajo> but with the scrollable
[04:08:30] <misterm> noob: it would be something like $("#tree-single-node-1").find("a").click(function(){ /* what you want to do */ })
[04:09:02] <bobdobbs> I can't really tell from reading that code. Do you have a live example?
[04:09:25] <bluenavajo> me?
[04:09:32] <noob> misterm do i give display and id of that row in brackets
[04:09:33] <noob> rite:?
[04:10:06] <misterm> noob: I'm not sure what you mean
[04:11:27] <noob> the query which you gave me should be inside the div rite
[04:11:28] <noob> ?
[04:12:41] <misterm> noob: what do you mean "inside the div"?
[04:13:21] <noob> sorry wrong question
[04:13:41] <Woet> just so you know, noob is a troll with bullshit questions just to waste your time.
[04:14:38] <noob> thanks for that
[04:14:53] <noob> i kept wondering only i think that way or does someelse has the same doubt
[04:27:34] <Camer0n> hello, I'm trying to make a script that when you click on the search bar it changes colour here: http://spareslist.com/
[04:27:37] <OverTaf> hey all
[04:27:40] <Camer0n> there are no errors it just doesnt work
[04:28:13] <Andy-> can anyone see any major flaws with this: $(this).parents('div.item').('p:not(:nth-child(2))').not('.moreless-toggler') ?
[04:29:19] <Andy-> lol nvm
[04:29:22] <Andy-> missing function :p
[04:31:31] <misterm> Camer0n: you're attaching your click listener before the page is fully loaded
[04:31:44] <Camer0n> oh, ok, how do i fix that?
[04:31:56] <misterm> Camer0n: either use $().live() or move it inside your $().ready() function
[04:32:06] <Camer0n> ok
[04:32:27] <misterm> Camer0n: also, do you really want every div to change color?
[04:32:33] <Camer0n> no
[04:32:40] <Camer0n> just the search bar
[04:32:51] <misterm> Camer0n: then you need to use a more specific selector
[04:34:16] <Camer0n> ok, so I've fixed all that but its still not working
[04:34:22] <Mateo_> Whirl3d: did you try the string to function tip that i gave you ?N
[04:34:26] <Camer0n> misterm
[04:35:13] <misterm> Camer0n: you have a syntax error
[04:35:41] <Camer0n> oh, whats wrong iwth it?
[04:36:28] <misterm> Camer0n: look carefully at where you pasted the code
[04:37:40] <Camer0n> ok, but that still doesn't work :/
[04:37:56] <misterm> Camer0n: did you fix it?
[04:38:01] <Camer0n> yes
[04:38:29] <Camer0n> it says
[04:38:30] <Camer0n> http://spareslist.com/:27Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[04:39:26] <misterm> Camer0n: yes, check the docs on $().css()
[04:39:44] <misterm> Camer0n: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[04:41:06] <Camer0n> i dont see anything wrong with it??
[04:41:26] <misterm> Camer0n: look at the examples
[04:41:33] <Camer0n> ohhh
[04:41:36] <Camer0n> i see, hang on
[04:42:08] <Camer0n> yeay! it works!! thanks!
[04:42:40] <misterm> np
[04:48:02] <square> morning folks.
[04:48:42] <john___> hello
[04:49:18] <square> I'm after some adice. is animate() the best option when I want to move a divs' background image up by 181px on click?
[04:52:22] <misterm> square: do you want the movement to be animated?
[04:59:01] <Stockholder> Good Morning
[04:59:42] <loopyduck> hi, i'm using the animate method. i wrote a callback function, but when i execute it, it goes into an infinite loop/recursion. if i don't execute it as a callback, it executes once (as intended) what could i be doing wrong?
[05:01:16] <misterm> loopyduck: there's about 8 million things you could be doing wrong...can you put up a pastebin or jsfiddle with your code?
[05:01:35] <jeffsmykil> is there a good article or tutorial on how to traverse xml documents?
[05:02:30] <loopyduck> misterm, i understand, the problem is that the code is extremely confusing as most of the javascript code was written using an excel to javascript "compiler"
[05:03:18] <loopyduck> i guess i can pastebin it anyway
[05:03:46] <loopyduck> http://pastebin.com/Mz5AVAQf
[05:04:26] <loopyduck> the relevant section is at the very bottom
[05:04:28] <misterm> loopyduck: where is the animate call?
[05:04:37] <loopyduck> misterm, at the bottom
[05:04:56] <loopyduck> i commented it out
[05:05:03] <loopyduck> but when i call recalc_onclick when it's not a callback
[05:05:07] <loopyduck> there's no infinite loop
[05:05:52] <loopyduck> the code i pasted is commented out because i was testing to see if recalc_onclick would be executed only once if it's not being used as a callback
[05:06:03] <loopyduck> and it is
[05:06:04] <misterm> loopyduck: I'm not sure what you mean
[05:06:19] <misterm> loopyduck: and what exactly is looping infinitely?
[05:07:50] <loopyduck> misterm, in the method recalc_onclick(), i put in an alert('test'); at the top, whenever i call recalc_onclick, i know it's executed if the alert shows. it works fine until i use it in the callback of jquerys animate method
[05:08:04] <loopyduck> then i get an infinite amount of alerts
[05:08:08] <misterm> loopyduck: don't use alert for that, use console.log
[05:08:15] <square> misterm: sorry.. yes i do
[05:08:27] <misterm> square: then yes, use animate()
[05:12:43] <rindolf> Hi all. Which JavaScript automated testing framework (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#JavaScript ) would you people recommend?
[05:13:25] <jeffsmykil>  any idea why this wouldn't work?  var roomIDs = $(this).find("room").map(function() { return $(this).attr('id'); }).get();
[05:14:04] <Whirl3d> "room" or ".room"
[05:14:26] <jeffsmykil> its xml
[05:14:51] <rindolf> jeffsmykil: I'm not sure jQuery supports XML.
[05:14:59] <Whirl3d> so then it's room, okay
[05:15:03] <jeffsmykil> with ajax it does
[05:15:34] <Whirl3d> I've never used jquery for anything but dom selection/manipulation.
[05:15:59] <erichynds> XML documents work fine with jquery
[05:15:59] <jeffsmykil> yeah traversing xml with jquery is hard
[05:16:04] <Whirl3d> so, sorry, I can't be of any assistance
[05:16:07] <jeffsmykil> cant imagine it without jquery
[05:16:15] <tuxx-> Hello, i'm trying to build a page where jquery grid fills a table with checkboxes. In total there are 365 checkboxes, one for every day of the year. Is it advisable to have jquery generate so many checkboxes? Our performance is really slow, when clicking a checkbox it takes 0.5 second to actually show the check, and this is without sending ajax event at an onclick. Does anyone know if there is a jquery example with this many checkboxes that actually performs norma
[05:16:38] <tuxx-> hm, double question in there :-P
[05:17:53] <misterm> tuxx-: that doesn't actually sound like too much purely in terms of dom elements, but you should be careful how you write your code
[05:18:08] <hex``> Only without line 4 the alert is appearing. What could be the problem? http://dpaste.com/578454/
[05:18:28] <misterm> tuxx-: for example, you should be using event delegation for any event listeners, be careful what you're storing for those elements, watch closures, etc
[05:18:45] <tuxx-> misterm: mkay
[05:18:51] <tuxx-> misterm: *dives back into the code and docs*
[05:19:16] <misterm> hex``: that's not valid JS
[05:19:28] <misterm> hex``: you need an identifer, variable name
[05:20:34] <hex``> ok, I changed var to "variableTest", but still... the alert only pops up when I remove the line 4
[05:21:05] <misterm> hex``: are you getting an error?
[05:21:12] <hex``> nope
[05:21:21] <hex``> the alert just doesn't popup
[05:22:06] <misterm> hex``: you must be getting an error wether your browser shows it or not, or theres something else youre leaving out
[05:22:25] <misterm> hex``: can you create a jsfiddle that reproduces the problem?
[05:22:26] <hex``> oh well I debugged it and it is showing $ is not a function
[05:22:51] <hex``> I'm new to javascript/jquery so I don't know wheter this error is related to my code
[05:23:17] <misterm> hex``: an uncaught error is going to cause your code to stop executing
[05:24:13] <hex``> so, in order to know what error it is I must crate a jsfiddle
[05:24:33] <misterm> hex``: not neccesarily, but it will certainly help in figuring it out
[05:24:50] <hex``> ok thanks
[05:25:51] <Whirl3d> if it's showing $ is not a function, it's likely not loading jquery because of a bad url in your header...that's been my experience at least
[05:26:38] <hex``> Whirl3d that's the wierd part. If it's not loading the jquery, when I click over the radio button while there's no line 4 (variableTest =...) nothing should happen
[05:26:42] <mazzachre> How do I find out if the jquery object I have, point to somewhere in the dom? Like if I do $('#nowhere') I still get a jquery object, but it does not point to anywhere...
[05:26:48] <hex``> but the alert popups ok when there's no line 4
[05:26:57] <hex``> so it is not a jquery loading problem, I believe..
[05:27:07] <coldhead> weird*
[05:27:23] <rchavik> hi, i'm doing a periodic $.getJSON() every minute, do i have to delete the returned object or something? firefox keeps freezing/locking up after a few times..
[05:27:25] <misterm> mazzachre: you can check the length to see how many elements it holds
[05:28:06] <coldhead> no that shouldn't be a problem, rchavik
[05:28:23] <coldhead> try the profiling tools in firebug to see if it's running out of memory or something
[05:28:26] <Whirl3d> hex, did you try changing line 4 to var something=....rather than var =   or variablename=
[05:28:28] <rchavik> coldhead, okay.. must be firefox or one of its plugins then
[05:28:36] <hex``> Whirl3d yes... still not working
[05:29:16] <Whirl3d> you need quotes around the property selector value like $("inmput[name='something']");
[05:30:02] <hex``> let me try
[05:30:46] <coldhead> chrome's web inspector might give another perspective, rchavik
[05:30:58] <hex``> nothing changed, Whirl3d
[05:31:08] <rchavik> coldhead, running profiler now.. but i have a suspicion that it's firebug itself who's causing the freeze
[05:31:22] <jeffsmykil> can anyone help me with xml traversing:
[05:31:34] <jeffsmykil> trying to find a child with a certain ID
[05:32:13] <Cork> jeffsmykil: $('#your-id .my-child', xml);
[05:32:39] <Whirl3d> hex, you also don't close your docready function
[05:33:05] <jeffsmykil> cork well I want to look inside of a room with a certain ID
[05:33:16] <jeffsmykil> same thing?
[05:33:22] <hex``> Whirl3d I closed, I just don't pasted it ;/ weird, isn't it?
[05:33:40] <Cork> jeffsebring: pb some example xml
[05:33:48] <jeffsmykil> k hold on
[05:35:18] <misterm> hex``: what about something like $('input[name="escolha"]').has(':checked').val()
[05:35:43] <hex``> 1 sec
[05:36:14] <jeffsmykil> Cork:  http://pastebin.com/zZrbGhsk
[05:36:20] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/vcZ5m/
[05:36:27] <Whirl3d> works for me with a simple selector
[05:36:32] <jeffsmykil> so i want to get to the contents of a particular room
[05:36:44] <Cork> jeffsmykil: all of them?
[05:36:53] <jeffsmykil> nope just a specific one
[05:36:56] <Cork> or the actuall content element?
[05:36:58] <jeffsmykil> all of them i can do
[05:37:03] <hex``> Whirl3d I'm using a radiobutton, not a checkbox
[05:37:14] <misterm> hex``: are you working on that jsfiddle?
[05:37:26] <hex``> misterm not yet, I'm trying what  you said
[05:37:27] <hex``> 1 sec
[05:37:29] <Cork> jeffsmykil: $('#bed contents')
[05:37:31] <jeffsmykil> I want to be able to find room id = bed
[05:37:36] <hex``> no, didn't work... I'll try on jsfiddle
[05:37:39] <jeffsmykil> oh ok
[05:37:41] <jeffsmykil> that easy
[05:37:42] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[05:37:48] <Cork> jeffsebring: ids has to be uniq, so no need to select on room
[05:37:52] <Cork> *jeffsmykil
[05:37:57] <Whirl3d> you really need to post some valid code to look at. This guessing bs is out of hand
[05:38:05] <jeffsmykil> yeah kind of a brainfart
[05:38:25] <hex``> yes, I'm doing it. 1 sec
[05:39:03] <mazzachre> misterm: Thanks... that worked :)
[05:39:26] <misterm> mazzachre: np
[05:39:31] <jeffsmykil> thank you Cork
[05:39:43] <Cork> jeffsmykil: no
[05:39:45] <Cork> *np
[05:40:35] <jeffsmykil> totally solved my problem
[05:40:36] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[05:41:16] <misterm> hex``: dont recreate everything on your page, just this one tiny part
[05:41:51] <hex``> misterm yes, it is the 1st time I'm using jsfiddle, so im trying to figure out where I get the permlink :P
[05:42:10] <Sir_Trapdoor> i've got an issue with jquery's slideUp() function, anyone care to help?
[05:42:20] <misterm> hex``: there should be a button at the top that says "save"
[05:42:32] <hex``> misterm Whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/hex0/mvKgb/
[05:42:38] <Sir_Trapdoor> regardless of which browser i use, it'll pause for X milliseconds that the slide animation is supposed to last, then it just disappears
[05:42:40] <misterm> Sir_Trapdoor: if you've got a question just ask it, preferably with a live test case or jsfiddle
[05:43:01] <Sir_Trapdoor> i do not have a live test as it's on a protected site
[05:43:05] <Sir_Trapdoor> i can provide the jsfiddle however
[05:43:34] <Sir_Trapdoor> http://jsfiddle.net/ZaKWT/ this is the fiddle in question
[05:44:07] <Sir_Trapdoor> that's just the javascript, it is called with an onclick('add(id_here);return false;)
[05:44:43] <hex``> misterm Whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/hex0/mvKgb/ ... remove the line var x... and alert shows up
[05:44:48] <Sir_Trapdoor> i have not set jQuery.fx.off anywhere, i think
[05:46:28] <Sir_Trapdoor> updated the fiddle with an example of the html
[05:48:02] <Sir_Trapdoor> it worked on chrome once, but after i refreshed the page, it stopped working
[05:48:05] <misterm> hex``: what version of jQuery are you using on your page?
[05:48:11] <hex``> 1.3.2
[05:50:44] <misterm> hex``: ok, so has wouldnt work
[05:50:45] <ProLoser|Mobile> what's the best placeholder plugin?
[05:51:10] <misterm> hex``: why are you attaching the click listener to the form?
[05:51:52] <hex``> I'm attaching to the input[name='escolha'] located inside the form#atualizacaoIndividual
[05:52:01] <hex``> in case there are another input with the same name in other form
[05:52:04] <misterm> $("input").click(function() { var x = $('input[name="escolha"]:checked').val() console.log(x)
[05:52:07] <misterm> });$("input").click(function() { var x = $('input[name="escolha"]:checked').val() console.log(x)
[05:52:10] <misterm> });$("input").click(function() { var x = $('input[name="escolha"]:checked').val() console.log(x)
[05:52:13] <misterm> });$("input").click(function() { var x = $('input[name="escolha"]:checked').val() console.log(x)
[05:52:16] <misterm> whoa
[05:52:26] <misterm> but yea, why not attach to the input themselves?
[05:52:32] <hex``> in case there are another input with the same name in other form?
[05:52:49] <misterm> hex``: you could only attach to the inputs of that form
[05:52:54] <misterm> hex``: or check their parent, etc
[05:53:02] <hex``> that's what I am doing, right?
[05:53:07] <hex``> form#atualizacaoIndividual is the parent
[05:53:26] <misterm> ah, yea I didn't see that, sorry
[05:53:42] <misterm> my computer keeps freezing :-/
[05:53:58] <hex``> that sucks
[05:54:26] <hex``> man
[05:54:40] <ProLoser|Mobile> misterm: you on mac?
[05:54:42] <zay2> Hello. I have odd problem with jQuery ajax. It completes request, but success callback never fires. My code and response i get are here : http://dpaste.com/578478/
[05:54:53] <hex``> as I see this bug is hard to solve... everyone here can't understand what is causing
[05:54:57] <Sir_Trapdoor> well i'll try again
[05:55:03] <hex``> at least it's not only me :D
[05:55:42] <Sir_Trapdoor> http://jsfiddle.net/ZaKWT/3/ i've got an issue with jQuery's slideUp function, it "works" but it waits the X milliseconds the animation should last, then hides it without actually showing the animation
[05:56:15] <Sir_Trapdoor> i've attached the js, and a snippet of the html to the jsfiddle, but that doesn't appear to work properly
[05:57:08] <hex``> misterm anyways you helped me solve
[05:57:23] <hex``> the correct way: var x = $("form#atualizacaoIndividual input[name='escolha']:checked").val();
[05:57:28] <hex``> what I was doing: var x = $("input[name='escolha']:checked").val();
[05:57:37] <dinosaadeh> hi guys, can anyone refer me to a script that scrolls images in one frame and at the same time, when the mouse is over the image, it zooms an area? I tried a solution but it is not working http://www.square-lounge.com/beta/menu
[05:58:40] <misterm> hex``: part of the problem was youre using an older version of jQuery, so its hard to remember how to do stuff
[05:58:43] <mazzachre> How to select multiple IDs in one go? I want to bind a handler for an event on number of divs selected by their IDs
[05:58:50] <misterm> hex``: I mean in terms of making it hard to solve
[05:58:55] <hex``> mm yes
[05:59:14] <Sir_Trapdoor> to be honest i could probably do $(this).closest('tr') but it has the same effect
[06:00:13] <Sir_Trapdoor> nah that didn't work oddly enough
[06:00:46] <zay2> I updated my problem abit - http://dpaste.com/578483/. perhaps someone who has excellent jquery ajax knowledge can look through it and assist please?
[06:01:43] <molavy> how can i do this, while something post from page to server ,user can't do anything
[06:01:46] <molavy> ?
[06:02:17] <molavy> that mean's click on page son't work
[06:03:27] <adbe> molavy: google uilock
[06:05:04] <gar_onn> molavy, add a DIV on to of all elemnts, z-index:99
[06:05:24] <misterm> hex``: What the issue was I believe was you were getting a lot of results back for your selector, then trying to do val()
[06:05:33] <misterm> hex``: which only makes sense for a single element
[06:05:41] <misterm> hex``: so you just needed to narrow it down more
[06:07:11] <molavy> how can i detect what element cause send post and lock it while callback from server
[06:07:28] <Boubalou> can has help!
[06:07:33] <misterm> molavy: wut?
[06:09:40] <misterm> molavy: how can an element "cause" "send post" and what would it mean to "lock" an element?
[06:11:12] <molavy> think you have lot's of element in page that every one send some data to special page. you don't want write $(this).css("visibility","hidden") and after response $(this).css("visibility","visible"). so how write a function that detect what element send data and lock it
[06:11:50] <molavy> ...send some data to special (url)...
[06:11:51] <misterm> molavy: you're still not being entirely clear
[06:12:17] <misterm> molavy: but it sounds like what you want to do is have a delegated listener, and then check the target of the event
[06:13:02] <molavy> ok you have lot of element and event .every time a element send data lock it,
[06:13:10] <misterm> molavy: how do the elements "send some data"...are you saying you have event listeners attached to them and those trigger an AJAX request?
[06:13:36] <misterm> molavy: also, what do you mean by "lock it", it looks like what you mean is to hide it
[06:13:52] <Sir_Trapdoor> is there a reason a slideUp() call would pause X milliseconds while the animation is supposed to run, and then just disappear?
[06:14:19] <misterm> Sir_Trapdoor: is that's what's happening to you?
[06:14:25] <Sir_Trapdoor> yes
[06:14:36] <misterm> Sir_Trapdoor: then there must be a reason
[06:14:56] <molavy> somthing like hide it or if it is link change it to another thing.it is important that how detect that element
[06:15:08] <Sir_Trapdoor> yes misterm, there must be a reason
[06:15:27] <misterm> molavy: ok, but can you explain more about how your page is structured? it's hard to give advice on vague descriptions
[06:15:48] <Sir_Trapdoor> $("#"+x).closest('tr').slideUp(100);
[06:16:04] <misterm> molavy: I would check out http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[06:16:21] <misterm> molavy: in particular check out the property "target", that seems to be what you're looking for
[06:16:49] <Sir_Trapdoor> fadeout works, but not slideUp
[06:17:02] <Sir_Trapdoor> misterm: ^
[06:17:42] <qwerty57> i have a "widget" that has a button on top right that when clicked should show options like personalise, minimize, help. i'm trying to creating this on click show these options. i don't know what is it correctly called. modal dialog?
[06:18:02] <qwerty57> i'm trying to create this - on click show these options
[06:18:03] <qwerty57> *
[06:18:28] <qwerty57> it's like when u right click and have popup showing options
[06:18:43] <misterm> qwerty57: yea, sounds like you want something like a dialog box
[06:19:03] <sadmicrowave>  ?dialog @ qwerty57

[06:19:32] <qwerty57> cheers
[06:21:03] <qwerty57> i'll need it to be opened next to the button(i'll have several widgets). will i be able to do that ?
[06:21:11] <hvgotcodes> for some reason, when i focus a text input, the entire text is selected.  how do i force the cursor to the end of the text?
[06:21:40] <sadmicrowave> qwerty57, I think you can specify left and top offsets as parameters in its init
[06:24:40] <qwerty57> actually i'll just go with something like navbar dropdown
[06:24:54] <sadmicrowave> cool
[06:28:45] <dabear> hvgotcodes: http://jsfiddle.net/Dmj6y/1/
[06:28:55] <dabear> works in firefox and chrome at least
[06:30:29] <dabear> and IE 9
[06:30:40] <dabear> for older IE versions, use createTextRange
[06:34:23] <molavy> event.target.nodeName always return html
[06:34:32] <molavy> $('html').ajaxSend( function(event, xhr, settings) {
[06:34:32] <molavy> 		alert(event.target.nodeName);
[06:35:11] <molavy> any idea?
[06:35:35] <hvgotcodes> dabear: thanx for the link
[06:35:53] <hvgotcodes> im working in the inlineEditorDidBeginEditing, so i have a reference to the editor view
[06:36:02] <hvgotcodes> i get the view via editor.$input()
[06:36:13] <slymn> hello
[06:36:16] <hvgotcodes> hmm, still the entire thing is selected
[06:36:47] <molavy> misterm,are you there
[06:36:49] <molavy> ?
[06:39:37] <semperos> using jquery validate plugin, I see you can add rules to an element outside of validate()
[06:39:50] <semperos> by doing $('#foo').rules("add", "name-of-rule")
[06:39:58] <semperos> that's fine, for rules like "required" that don't require a second argument
[06:40:05] <semperos> but how would I do that for something like "minlength" ?
[06:40:23] <semperos> if I just do $('#foo').rules("add", "minlength"), it defaults to validating minlength of 1
[06:40:31] <slymn> hello
[06:40:35] <semperos> I've tried several combinations, but was wondering if someone knew how to do it
[06:40:53] <slymn> do u know this plroblem http://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-startingslide-in-jquery-cycle-flashes-the-first-slide-in-ie-before-displaying-startingslide
[06:41:08] <slymn> do u have a solution?
[06:42:01] <sadmicrowave> semperos, you need to make an object out of what you are adding
[06:42:33] <sadmicrowave> semperos, in this case .rules("add",{required: true, minlength:2});
[06:42:35] <semperos> sadmicrowave: got it, that worked
[06:42:37] <semperos> thanks :)
[06:42:45] <semperos> yep, that makes sense now
[06:42:56] <molavy> think you have lot's of element in page that every one send some data to special url. you don't want write $(this).css("visibility","hidden") and after response $(this).css("visibility","visible"). so how write a  global function that run every time a data sent and detect what element send data and lock it
[06:42:57] <semperos> and is much preferrable, as I already have objects defined for my rules
[06:43:12] <semperos> having to use the .rules function in order to get elements which are hidden by default to actually be validated...
[06:43:13] <sadmicrowave> semperos, and you can go on from there too if you want to:
[06:43:13] <molavy> or hide it
[06:43:34] <semperos> sadmicrowave: is it intentional that I can't call validate() multiple times, as new form elements are shifted from hidden to visible?
[06:43:48] <sadmicrowave> semperos, .rules("add",{required: true, minlength:2, messages:{required:"required input", minlength:"at least 10 characters please!"}});
[06:43:59] <semperos> oh, sweet
[06:44:08] <semperos> you can embed the messages, that was my next research task
[06:44:34] <slymn> can anyone help me?
[06:44:38] <sadmicrowave> funny thing, I don't know anything about .validate() or .rules(), I've never used them in my life
[06:44:43] <semperos> slymn: they'll answer if they can :)
[06:44:44] <sadmicrowave> semperos, I got everything from this http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/rules
[06:45:03] <slymn> ok :(
[06:45:10] <bobdobbs> Whirl3d: you still there? I fixed the animation problem I was having before.
[06:45:29] <semperos> sadmicrowave: that's what I get for skimming the docs and relying on blog-post examples
[06:45:35] <semperos> didn't see the note about using object syntax
[06:45:41] <semperos> sadmicrowave: many thanks
[06:45:47] <sadmicrowave> semperos, no problem
[06:46:20] <sadmicrowave> molavy, are you using $.ajax() or what?
[06:46:39] <molavy> $.post
[06:47:27] <Whirl3d> bobdobbs, what was the issue?
[06:47:47] <sadmicrowave> molavy, try using $.ajax(). It has a handler for beforeSend: where you can place a function like $('mydiv').hide() and another handler for after: where you can place a function like $('mydiv').show()
[06:48:02] <sadmicrowave> ?ajax @ molavy
[06:48:03] <bot-t> molavy, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:49:10] <molavy> event.target.nodeName always return html
[06:49:15] <molavy> $('html').ajaxSend( function(event, xhr, settings) {
[06:49:20] <molavy> alert(event.target.nodeName);
[06:49:46] <sadmicrowave> is there a question in there somewhere?
[06:51:27] <square> when checking an index of li's within a ul.. do they start at 0 or 1?
[06:51:41] <molavy> any idea?
[06:55:06] <cbobo> If I .append("<div id='foo'></div>");
[06:55:29] <cbobo> and then I would like to add an $('#foo').click( function() {}); to it
[06:55:35] <cbobo> would that be possiable?
[06:55:47] <cbobo> since, I created it with an append?
[06:55:49] <rindolf> cbobo: it should be.
[06:55:49] <Whirl3d> cbobo, yes
[06:55:58] <rindolf> cbobo: the append will change the DOM.
[06:56:01] <cbobo> hm, wonder why it is not working
[06:56:12] <Whirl3d> to what are you appending it?
[06:56:19] <cbobo> to an id
[06:56:25] <cbobo> I can see it appened fine
[06:56:30] <cbobo> just the .click is not working
[06:56:39] <cbobo> i am going to try a hover or something else to see
[06:56:40] <Whirl3d> do you have more than one #foo?
[06:57:52] <Whirl3d> cbobo, also check your zIndex settings for any elements that could be intercepting the click above the appended foo
[06:58:43] <cbobo> o ya, right, i will just but some inline styles then for that div as well
[06:58:44] <sadmicrowave> molavy, any ideas on what? you didn't ask anything...you just talking about always returning html
[07:03:11] <cbobo> Also, if I put some styles in a StyleSheet for the element that i am going to .append into HTML
[07:03:25] <cbobo> will the styles sheet get auto loaded as soon as the element is .appened in
[07:03:28] <cbobo> ?
[07:05:50] <square> cbobo: try it :)
[07:09:29] <cbobo> ya, it works it's amazing
[07:09:41] <cbobo> anyway, can I call an Element that has an ID and a class?
[07:09:56] <cbobo> like; $('#idhere .classnamehere')
[07:10:08] <cbobo> so it only calls an id if it also has a class name?
[07:11:19] <lacrymology> good morning. I'm trying to stretch the background image's height to the document's height, but for some reason at $(document).ready() document.height returns larger than it should. If I don't do it at ready() and do it through the console later on, it works fine. Anyone knows why?
[07:13:18] <square> jsfiddle is slow :(
[07:15:39] <lacrymology> or at least, is there a way for me to run some javascript "later on"?
[07:17:51] <square> http://82.148.225.142/GoCharitable2011 - does anyone know why when the slider image changes the background doesn't change on the "please help us" div?
[07:18:30] <square> it changes - but then jumps back

[07:46:42] <Iarfen> How I can give the letters a "shine" effect?
[07:47:28] <SSIlver2k2> i have a problem with jquery.  i have an id like this.  ids="content_1,content2,content_3" and i want to find that one id if it has content_3 in it.  it seems that the commas are mucking everything up
[07:52:52] <WebDragon> Iarfen: http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/text-shadow ?
[07:53:07] <WebDragon> but it's css3 so support may not be there for all browsers
[07:53:08] <rindolf> SSIlver2k2: hi, you can find all elements that have an id attribute and then filter it using a regex.
[07:53:14] <WebDragon> hey rindolf

[08:18:05] <Patatouf> hello ! i would like to submit a form with the $.ajax and "refresh" all the page with the response
[08:18:09] <Patatouf> how can i do that ?
[08:19:06] <kborchers> Patatouf: why would you use ajax for that and not just a regular form?
[08:19:38] <SSIlver2k2> i currently have <blah blah blah ids="block1,block2,block3>
[08:19:38] <SSIlver2k2> im using $('*[ids='block3')
[08:19:38] <SSIlver2k2> but im getting nothing.  if i remove block1,block2, it works fine
[08:19:38] <SSIlver2k2> how can i get that even with block1,block2
[08:19:52] <Patatouf> kborchers: because i have an array that i want to pass
[08:20:31] <Patatouf> kborchers: and i want to submit the form as soon as the user select a field in the autocomplete formtext
[08:20:40] <kborchers> Patatouf: and how are you passing an array? as JSON?
[08:21:10] <kborchers> actually, that won't work either. you can't post an object
[08:21:22] <Patatouf> kborchers: i am using data : {data: myarray,
[08:21:25] <Patatouf> oh
[08:21:58] <kborchers> it has to be serialized to a a=b&c=d format
[08:22:15] <Patatouf> ok i understand
[08:22:23] <Patatouf> so lets say i serialize the form
[08:23:08] <Patatouf> how would you refresh the whole page (since, i think it is the only way to submit the form as soon as the user select an option from the autocomplete form)
[08:24:08] <kborchers> Patatouf: no, you can just bind to the change event of the autocomplete and call $("#yourForm").submit() to submit the form
[08:24:46] <misterm> Patatouf: how would refreshing the page submit the form?
[08:24:47] <Patatouf> kborchers:  oh yes of course. that is what i was looking for ! thx
[08:25:03] <Patatouf> misterm: yes that was my question
[08:25:25] <misterm> Patatouf: no, I mean...just refreshing the page does not cause a form to be submitted
[08:25:35] <Patatouf> misterm: no of course
[08:25:36] <kborchers> misterm: he wanted to submit with ajax but then replace the entire contents of the page. talked him through just submitting the form
[08:25:48] <Patatouf> yes :)
[08:26:54] <_druu> hey guys
[08:27:46] <_druu> got a little problem... jquer ui, draggable.... the drag-event... why doesn't $(this).css('top', whatever); work on this event? on dragstop no problem
[08:29:33] <kborchers> _druu: why would you try to set top while dragging? the element is being positioned with every mouse movement. why would you want it to possibly jump away from the control of the mouse?
[08:29:39] <Godfather_> hi
[08:30:53] <_druu> kborchers: I'm working on a cropping plugin... but instead of choosing the area to crop, I'm moving the picture beneath a mask
[08:31:06] <_druu> and I want to prevent the picture being dragged out of the mask
[08:31:09] <Godfather_> i have a <span id="hide">...<span> and if i do: $("#hide").hide();  i get null element
[08:31:38] <Godfather_> why?
[08:31:49] <Hekim> does anyone have any experience of using jquery.validate over multiple forms identified with the same class?
[08:31:56] <kborchers> _druu: see http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-containment
[08:32:08] <Hekim> I'm having issues where the validate plugin is validating a different form to that which is being submitted
[08:33:06] <_druu> kborchers: I gave it a look already... did mess the whole thing up :(
[08:34:27] <_druu> think I'm going to live with the snapback
[08:34:28] <kborchers> _druu: then i would suggest the best solution is to use the stop event and just reposition the element to still be within the mask then. trying to set it during drag would not be fun
[08:34:47] <_druu> yup that's what I'm doing already
[08:35:15] <kborchers> ?demo @ Godfather_
[08:35:15] <bot-t> Godfather_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[08:35:54] <Flower21> Hello guys, i have a small question : this is my code and it works. i want to animate the opacity to the image in a specific div (with an id if possible ) how can i say this in jquery ??
[08:36:11] <Flower21> the images**
[08:36:53] <kborchers> ?animate @ Flower21
[08:36:54] <bot-t> Flower21, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[08:37:32] <Flower21> kborchers : thanks but where do i put the id of the div ??
[08:37:38] <Flower21> :P
[08:37:58] <Flower21> my code is here : http://jsfiddle.net/A8Uuq/
[08:38:00] <kborchers> Flower21: $("#divID").children("img").animate(...
[08:38:27] <Flower21> ok thanks i'll try that
[08:39:20] <motaka2> fields = {amper:"ampervalue", masraf:"masrafvalue"}   is this the right way to create objects in javascript ?
[08:40:04] <Flower21> kborchers : var images = $("#testzone").children("img").hover(function() { dosnt work
[08:41:14] <Flower21> can u give me an exemple on jsfiddle please ? :\
[08:41:52] <zoned> $(nextForm + ' input[name=step' + nextStep + ']').click(updatePart);
[08:41:55] <kborchers> Flower21: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/A8Uuq/1/
[08:42:04] <zoned> function updatePart() {alert(this);}
[08:42:21] <zoned> i'm trying to add a click handler to a radio button on my form
[08:42:27] <zoned> it isn't working.. what am i missing?
[08:42:55] <motaka2> fields = {amper:"ampervalue", masraf:"masrafvalue"} is this the right way to create objects in javascript ?
[08:43:42] <japherwocky> zoned: are you sure you're selecting the thing you're trying to select?
[08:44:07] <zoned> yes. because if (!($('#step' + step + 'Form input[name=step' + step + ']').is(':checked'))) { works perfectly to tell if it's checked or not
[08:44:51] <zoned> i'm grabbing the right object, but the .click(myFunc) isn't working..
[08:46:16] <kborchers> zoned: are you binding the click event after the dom is ready?
[08:46:35] <Flower21> kborchers : thanks for your help but it still dsnt work :\
[08:46:43] <Flower21> i'll try to work around that, thanks
[08:47:24] <Flower21> if the id is on a table instead of a div , it should workk too right?
[08:47:33] <kborchers> Flower21: no
[08:47:54] <zoned> kborchers: i'm not sure... i'm building the form dynamically. i append some radios to the form, then after that i have the line that (should) add the .click
[08:48:02] <kborchers> Flower21: change that to var images = $("#testzone").find("img");
[08:48:26] <zoned> maybe it would be easier to just add the onclick as an attribute when i build the radio button initially?
[08:48:42] <Flower21> ok thanks
[08:49:02] <bluenavajo> hello guys.
[08:49:02] <kborchers> zoned: by adding them dynamically do you mean via JS or something like PHP or another server side lang
[08:49:04] <kborchers> ?
[08:49:09] <Flower21> yep it works now
[08:49:17] <Flower21> kborchers++
[08:49:25] <Flower21> thanks again

[08:50:01] <kingmilo> Hi gents
[08:50:20] <bluenavajo> one question regarding selectors. if i have a jqery object containing a DOM element. how do i select the first child from that?
[08:50:23] <kborchers> zoned: hmmm, then the bind should work there. can you show us?
[08:50:26] <kborchers> ?demo @ zoned
[08:50:27] <bot-t> zoned, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:50:55] <bluenavajo> i mean not by typing in the whole $.(.class < .class2).....
[08:50:57] <zoned> can't show a live demo, it's using ajax and my database
[08:51:11] <zoned> hmm
[08:52:03] <kingmilo> My code: http://jsfiddle.net/LXVCe/  <-- works fine, id just like to apply a small delay to the results being displayed because when typing it feels like its getting stuck can somebody please assist?  - thanks!
[08:52:15] <tmayr> zoned: you can insert sample data instead of working directly with your db, just replicate your db output in js
[08:52:31] <kborchers> bluenavajo: $("element:first-child"); or $("element").children(":first"); or $("element").children().eq(0);
[08:53:02] <bluenavajo> and if i allready have a object? ca i perform these methods on it?
[08:53:15] <bluenavajo> but thank you so far kborchers
[08:53:24] <misterm> bluenavajo: yes
[08:53:30] <bluenavajo> ahh, of course... thx
[08:53:37] <misterm> bluenavajo: or $().children().first() ...theres a lot of ways
[08:53:37] <kborchers> bluenavajo: you would probably want the second or third options then
[08:53:50] <bluenavajo> tank you very much
[08:53:51] <kborchers> or misterm's
[08:54:58] <callumacrae> How could I go about reordering elements in jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/WQbr4/
[08:55:23] <callumacrae> that code is an example, don't flame me :P
[09:00:15] <plombardi> Has anyone used jquery.ui.layout plugin and know how to get rid of the padding on .ui-layout-pane. I figured setting padding: 0 on the element would work, but its still rendering with 10px and I've search the css file for any references to padding: 10px and can't find any.
[09:01:04] <kingmilo> anybody?
[09:01:05] <kingmilo> My code: http://jsfiddle.net/LXVCe/  <-- works fine, id just like to apply a small delay to the results being displayed because when typing it feels like its getting stuck can somebody please assist?  - thanks!
[09:05:50] <sphinxxx> is requesting one javascript file a big gain, over two separate ones from the same domain?
[09:06:26] <plombardi> Sigh, found my problem. Ambigious documentation is ambigious.
[09:09:04] <jorenl_> Hey! I'm trying to shrink a dropped jqueryui draggable in size with .animate() , however instead of shrinking it 'disappears' (width 0, height 0) and then grows to the size I supplied. Any idea how I can fix this? Thanks!

[09:18:21] <solidus-river> how do i clear everything out of a dom element using jquery

[09:19:02] <ngharo> forevernoob: whats the problem
[09:19:56] <forevernoob> ngharo: trying to make a slideshow. its supposed to cycle through, and when you click on the gray buttons itll skip to the one you want, then carry on cycling
[09:20:28] <forevernoob> been stuck on it for 2 days, cant figure out wtf is going wrong
[09:20:40] <Soothsayer> I'm working on a button similar in nature to addthis, sharethis. You load our remote js file in your site and then you add a <a class="_foo"></a> and my button loads itself into the <a> tags. I want to provide user options to customize the share. What would be a good way to do it ? How do I take customization options? via a global variable, additional attributes, ... ?
[09:21:25] <ngharo> forevernoob: it cycles for me.  the buttons are acting a little wonky although
[09:21:59] <forevernoob> the buttons dont work, and its not meant to slide into black.
[09:22:09] <forevernoob> nightmare
[09:22:36] <ngharo> you're aware of the jquery cycle plugin, yeah?
[09:23:05] <forevernoob> yes, dont want/need plugins, this should work
[09:23:17] <forevernoob> no idea why it doesnt
[09:23:28] <forevernoob> should have the same functionality as this http://www.dreamcss.com/2009/04/create-beautiful-jquery-sliders.html
[09:23:49] <WebDragon> with regards to printing a webpage, can I catch the action via jquery to make sure that certain sections get expanded before it attempts to print?
[09:24:08] <WebDragon> or should I add a print icon that triggers the expansion and then calls for the print dialog

[09:26:15] <ngharo> WebDragon: you can specify print stylesheets
[09:26:28] <devinrolsen> WebDragon! long time man.

[09:26:36] <WebDragon> indeed
[09:27:02] <WebDragon> ngharo: I have print stylesheets. however the sections of the doc that have been collapsed with jquery STAY collapsed because the styles are inline, not in the css
[09:27:36] <WebDragon> what I need is to trigger them to expand before any print action gets called
[09:29:09] <devinrolsen> did you heal all up from that bike accident a while back WebDragon?
[09:29:26] <WebDragon> devinrolsen: yeah all's well now .. still haven't replaced the bike though, yet.

[09:35:13] <pentarex1> hey guys why my code returns [object Object]
[09:35:43] <kborchers> pentarex1: are you using alert?
[09:35:48] <devinrolsen> WebDragon, are you making use of the live events because the dom has yet be built, thus the events have nothing to be bound to?
[09:36:09] <pentarex1> kborchers: yes this is my code http://pastebin.com/YVaB3PTF and payload is multidimensional array
[09:36:10] <kborchers> ?alert @ pentarex1
[09:36:11] <devinrolsen> could you not just order the script to not use live and just bind the events after the dom has been built?
[09:36:13] <bot-t> pentarex1, Forget alertuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browsers built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[09:36:24] <devinrolsen> (ps. I got nothing against live)
[09:36:32] <WebDragon> devinrolsen: yeap. .menusection gets added by the script

[09:39:34] <zoned> can someone tell me why my <li>'s don't wrap around my radio buttons when the following code is ran? http://pastebin.com/VU8XM2me
[09:39:57] <pentarex1> guys can someone tell me what I am doing wrong and why my data is null
[09:39:58] <pentarex1> http://pastebin.com/qyrHkE9a
[09:40:02] <kborchers> pentarex1: if data really is a multidemensional array, then test is going to be the first element in that array, which is still an array. use console.log and you'll see that
[09:40:19] <pentarex1> kborchers: data is null :S
[09:40:22] <pentarex1> http://pastebin.com/qyrHkE9a this is my code
[09:40:35] <kborchers> pentarex1: that's not what you said before, you were getting object
[09:40:38] <forevernoob> mmm, assembly tasty stuff
[09:40:58] <pentarex1> kborchers: yeah I am very new in jquery
[09:41:04] <forevernoob> would be so awesome if you could speak in assembly lang
[09:41:15] <forevernoob> like fluently
[09:41:39] <kborchers> also, that is not a multidemensional array, it is going to return JSON, but you can not send JSON in a get request. that data must be serialized
[09:42:09] <forevernoob> actually on the verge of paying someone to make this code work
[09:42:22] <forevernoob> serious last resort
[09:42:25] <zoned> can someone tell me why my li's don't wrap around my radio buttons? please see code and output: http://pastebin.com/RkTa3MnK
[09:42:26] <zoned> thanks
[09:42:26] <WebDragon> one of his roommates used to know the trick about getting the giant drives to 'walk' along the floor by spinning them in just the right way
[09:42:36] <WebDragon> I forget what it was called
[09:42:37] <ngharo> forevernoob: you're reinventing the wheel.  Use a plugin and stop pulling your hair out
[09:43:18] * WebDragon wishes the movie and tv industry would get the point about re-inventing the wheel and stop remaking stuff and come up with more original ideas. sheesh.
[09:43:36] <kborchers> pentarex1: this will not work $.each(payload, function(index, test) {  What is payload?
[09:43:51] <WebDragon> ONE MORE PETER PAN REMIX AND IT's GONNA BE JURASSIC PARK IX: "BARNEY GOES OFF HIS MEDS" over here
[09:43:51] <zoned> kborchers: got a new one for you :P
[09:43:52] <forevernoob> ngharo - i need the code as light as possible, and i dont want to have to learn an entire plugin. this needs to be sorted asap
[09:43:59] <WebDragon> }B=&P
[09:44:19] <pentarex1> kborchers: payload comes from one xml file.... that stores the information
[09:44:32] <forevernoob> its so close to working, just need to stop the queues in the right places
[09:44:37] <kborchers> zoned: you're not using append correctly
[09:44:53] <pentarex1> I think it must be data.payload
[09:45:24] <devinrolsen> sorry about that WebDragon, we are having net issues here at the CSS summit.
[09:45:34] <zoned> kborchers: can you explain? it is working, i just don't see why the li's are ended?
[09:45:36] <WebDragon> oh fun
[09:45:39] <devinrolsen> http://www.flickr.com/photos/petragyocum/5978500322/in/photostream
[09:45:41] <devinrolsen> hehe
[09:45:53] <devinrolsen> right in the middle of all the action.
[09:46:46] <WebDragon> watch out for the Kaptain Kangaroo ping pong ball trap
[09:46:57] <TeddyMurray> anyone know why fancybox jquery doesn't work in IE9?
[09:47:43] <devinrolsen> I'm looking forward to the Kaptain Kangaroo ping pong.. :(
[09:48:10] <zoned> TeddyMurray, looks like a known issue: http://tinyurl.com/3e477r7
[09:48:27] <TeddyMurray> yeah ive looked at a few forums, but can't find it
[09:48:33] <devinrolsen> TeddyMurray have you tried to use colorbox instead?
[09:48:38] <devinrolsen> I like it a lot.
[09:48:45] <TeddyMurray> zoned, that's cute to do let me google that for you
[09:48:48] <zoned> haha
[09:48:51] <TeddyMurray> but of course ive googled it.
[09:48:52] <zoned> sorry
[09:48:52] <TeddyMurray> ;p
[09:48:53] <johnline3> $(window).resize(function() {$('#footer').css('position','relative');}, function() {$('#footer').css('position','absolute');});
[09:49:01] <kborchers> zoned: try http://pastebin.com/8GzWcuEp
[09:49:07] <johnline3> heres me trying to stick the footer to the bottom of the page on resize
[09:49:09] <johnline3> problem?
[09:49:10] <TeddyMurray> <3
[09:49:10] <forevernoob> thats it. i swear on the lord jesus christ, i will paypal 10 to whoever solves it
[09:49:14] <TeddyMurray> devinrolsen, ill try that
[09:50:08] <devinrolsen> yeah its the lightbox what we stick with here at ISITE now TeddyMurray.
[09:50:15] <TeddyMurray> ISITE?
[09:50:34] <Aple> Hey guys. Trying to make a simple AJAX-powered survey. Anyone have a tactic for doing this?
[09:50:35] <zoned> kborchers: that works. i see the proper way to use append now... now i need to go and change the rest of the code :P
[09:50:39] <zoned> thanks
[09:50:41] <devinrolsen> the web site agency I work with now.
[09:50:51] <TeddyMurray> cool, could i see your website?
[09:50:54] * WebDragon made some alterations to fancybox himself
[09:50:59] <WebDragon> how's colorbox different?
[09:51:01] <devinrolsen> http://www.isitedesign.com
[09:51:10] <TeddyMurray> WebDragon, im having trouble getting fancybox to work in IE9
[09:51:12] <devinrolsen> WebDragon, for one.. it works. :)
[09:51:12] <Aple> Right now I'm trying this: http://pressedweb.com/samples/ajax_survey/ which has a blank #survey div that loads (from questions.html) a div. Then when you click the next button, it's supposed to fadeout that div and load another one.
[09:51:15] <TeddyMurray> i think upgrading my jquery will work though... trying
[09:51:17] <kborchers> zoned: the key is you have to append actual elements so if you don't close a tag, it gets closed for you
[09:51:19] <Aple> Relevent code: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/446850/
[09:51:29] <WebDragon> devinrolsen: hehe
[09:51:58] <ikla> I have two id's for a news ticker that you need to click on to see the next event, can I have jquery do that every 10 seconds?
[09:52:02] <WebDragon> devinrolsen: so anyway, with that page I linked you to -- is there any way to trigger the expand-all when I go to print the page so that it doesn't try and print the collapsed sections incorrectly?
[09:52:10] <TeddyMurray> yeah fancybox isn't working at all
[09:52:11] <TeddyMurray> using colorbox
[09:52:16] <ikla> jquery click?
[09:52:36] <WebDragon> TeddyMurray: I got fancybox working here just fine : www.w-m-t.com all over the place
[09:52:44] <TeddyMurray> WebDragon, even in IE?
[09:52:46] <devinrolsen> WebDragon, sorry my net failed again so I lost the link after a quick reboot.
[09:52:58] <devinrolsen> but tell me is JS the one that is hiding the sub content, or css?
[09:53:04] <WebDragon> http://www.w-m-t.com/Products/Ozone_Generators.php here for example
[09:53:12] <sprezzatura> any good tooltip plugin?
[09:53:16] <WebDragon> TeddyMurray: see for yourself if it works. if it's NOT working. let me know
[09:53:31] <forevernoob> 10 paypal - http://jsfiddle.net/ajyJk/2/
[09:53:32] <WebDragon> devinrolsen: http://devel.caffegelato.net/mkdtest.php
[09:53:45] <WebDragon> devinrolsen: js is the one hiding the content
[09:54:09] <WebDragon> so it's all inline styles that have to be removed rather than css that can be overridden in the print styleshset
[09:54:11] <WebDragon> sheet*
[09:54:40] <TeddyMurray> it works WebDragon
[09:54:48] <WebDragon> toldya it worked
[09:54:49] <TeddyMurray> well wait, my divx web player plugin is disabled
[09:54:53] <TeddyMurray> let me re-enable it
[09:54:56] <TeddyMurray> because that's the issue
[09:55:11] <WebDragon> divx web player plugin conflicts with fancybox? how?
[09:55:24] <WebDragon> how could that even be possible
[09:55:38] <TeddyMurray> i dunno why, it worked after i disabled it though
[09:55:41] <TeddyMurray> and i read it on a forum
[09:55:56] <WebDragon> wonder if it causes other issues with jquery
[09:55:58] * Aple flounders around
[09:56:12] * WebDragon readies the no fishing ordinances
[09:56:15] <Aple> Trying to make an AJAX form. Anyone have a workflow for this? Not asking for anyone to make it for me.
[09:56:18] <TeddyMurray> lol
[09:56:24] <Aple> Just can't figure out the business logic of it
[09:56:32] <TeddyMurray> well your code seems to work, gunna try to copy it from  your site
[09:56:35] <Aple> Doesn't even have to pass vars or submit to db
[09:56:45] <WebDragon> TeddyMurray: my fancybox is not stock
[09:56:59] <WebDragon> I've made alterations to it -- pulled out all the IE-specific stuff and put them in conditional comments
[09:57:06] <WebDragon> few other things
[09:57:26] <forevernoob> no one wants 10 for ~3 lines of code? wow.
[09:57:41] <devinrolsen> WebDragon, is the whole animate portion of exposing and hiding the sub menu content extremely important?
[09:57:42] <WebDragon> TeddyMurray: if you've got Opera handy, save the page as a web-archive (.mht) file so you get everything and can go over it at your leisure
[09:57:43] <TeddyMurray> do i need to credit you? XD
[09:57:47] <jeffsmykil> how do i pass this as a parameter?
[09:57:49] <TeddyMurray> nice, thanks!
[09:57:51] <jeffsmykil> i can never remember
[09:58:00] <devinrolsen> cause you could just hook into the open close class you are giving the upper sibling with purse css.
[09:58:08] <devinrolsen> that will be or can be ignored by your print.css
[09:58:10] <devinrolsen> if you will.
[09:58:10] <WebDragon> devinrolsen: I specifically had to put together the hiding/expanding content at the client's request for these new menus
[09:58:20] <necromancer> Aple: check out the jQuery.form plugin, specifically its sub-plugin ajaxSubmit
[09:58:36] <devinrolsen> but my question is if the animate portion of hide and expose of the content is important.
[09:58:44] <necromancer> it handles a lot of the "business" logic, all you need is a PHP file to accept the POST params
[09:58:53] <devinrolsen> would the client mind if it just popped open and popped closed
[09:58:54] <Aple> necromancer: Thanks man
[09:58:57] <necromancer> s/PHP/"PHP/Ruby/etc."
[09:59:00] <WebDragon> well, .opened is just being added so I can track when to add the altered   boxes, mostly
[09:59:13] <WebDragon> oh I see
[09:59:16] <TeddyMurray> which jquery verison is this WebDragon
[09:59:17] <Aple> necromancer: this one? http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[09:59:19] <WebDragon> rather than slid out ?
[09:59:24] <devinrolsen> yes
[09:59:31] <necromancer> that's right Aple
[09:59:34] <devinrolsen> see if you lose that, you can just do the whole hide and expose with purse css.
[09:59:37] <necromancer> very useful plugin
[09:59:39] <devinrolsen> pure css*
[09:59:41] <WebDragon> TeddyMurray: I think that site's using 1.5.2
[09:59:50] <Aple> necromancer++
[09:59:50] <jeffsmykil> Anyone?  How to pass $(this) as a parameter?
[09:59:54] <Aple> Thanks again
[10:00:21] <WebDragon> devinrolsen: yeah I suppose, though it would appear more abruptly to the end-user. this has the appearance of being slightly more elegant
[10:01:28] <WebDragon> TeddyMurray: you can credit me for the alterations if you like .. I'm gonna want to send that back upstream to the plugin author myself at some point anyway since it makes the whole thing easier to deal with
[10:02:09] <solidus-river> i'm trying to pull data out of an element in an inline function but i cant get the context right
[10:02:11] <solidus-river> whats wrong with this
[10:02:30] <devinrolsen> WebDragon .opened + .menusection {display:block;} //for opend   .menucontents h2 + .menusection {display:none;}
[10:02:54] <devinrolsen> would move it all over to purse css, thus when you fall back to the print.css, they will all automatically be exposed.
[10:02:54] <solidus-river> function(){ $('element').click(function(this.data()) }
[10:03:07] <devinrolsen> but you lose the elegant UX feel you have setup.
[10:03:12] <WebDragon> yeah
[10:03:17] <WebDragon> thought about that
[10:03:53] <WebDragon> hence why I'm curious if there's a way to detect when print gets called by the user, or if I should just set up a print icon that triggers the expand and then calls the print dialog itself
[10:03:54] <wesada> Hello all.
[10:04:30] <devinrolsen> well you could just override the inline display:none in the print.css as well.
[10:04:36] <devinrolsen> with the nasty !important.
[10:04:45] <devinrolsen> and I think including body to the selector.
[10:05:17] <WebDragon> hm
[10:05:35] <devinrolsen> try body .menusection {display:block !important;}
[10:05:42] <devinrolsen> in the print.css.
[10:06:05] <swiggy> is there a way with JQuery UI Sortable/Draggable to select MULTIPLE items to drag/sort instead of just 1?
[10:06:16] <TeddyMurray> D: god damn it
[10:06:26] <TeddyMurray> still not working in IE... something else must be broken..
[10:06:32] <wesada> I'm trying to add a UI button to an anchor that is created after the page is loaded.  I have the button assigned to a class of removeRow $(".removeRow").button(), but the button is never displayed just the anchor.
[10:06:38] <TeddyMurray> i wish IE had a firebug or a console or something
[10:06:44] <devinrolsen> are you getting any console errors  TeddyMurray?
[10:06:51] <stacks> $('#target').html('txt').show('slow');     why this dont work for me?
[10:06:55] <TeddyMurray> IE has an error console?
[10:07:01] <TeddyMurray> none in chrome
[10:07:09] <devinrolsen> open up the developer tools in IE
[10:07:47] <TeddyMurray> ah ha
[10:07:59] <devinrolsen> found an error?
[10:08:07] <a|i> is there an event in jquery to get fired when an element moves, eg, when resizing the window the element which is supposed to be at the centre moves.
[10:08:23] <swiggy> is there a way with JQuery UI Sortable/Draggable to select MULTIPLE items to drag/sort instead of just 1?
[10:08:25] <TeddyMurray> lol
[10:08:28] <TeddyMurray> it works now. cache error
[10:08:36] <devinrolsen> hurray!
[10:08:38] <TeddyMurray> ;D
[10:08:42] <TeddyMurray> <3 devinrolsen and WebDragon
[10:08:50] <WebDragon> yay
[10:08:54] <devinrolsen> lesson is always check the IE console.
[10:09:05] <swiggy> lesson is never use IE =\
[10:09:13] <WebDragon> firebug lite :)
[10:09:17] <swiggy> wish that could be known global
[10:09:18] <WebDragon> werks in IE
[10:09:20] <devinrolsen> cheap shot swiggy
[10:09:23] <devinrolsen> :) but I agree.
[10:09:36] <ikla> I have an <a id="haha"> how do I tell jquery to click that?
[10:09:44] <tbranyen> $("#id").click():
[10:09:46] <swiggy> one day devinrolsen, one day...
[10:09:46] <devinrolsen> WebDragon, I enjoy firebug lite for IE all 2 mins of it ever work stable.
[10:09:48] <devinrolsen> ;)
[10:09:51] * WebDragon sneaks out back and buries IE in the midden heap when no one is looking
[10:09:55] <tbranyen> fjdfk
[10:09:58] <stacks> $('#target').html('txt').show('slow');     why this dont work for me?
[10:09:59] <tbranyen> errr
[10:10:03] <tbranyen> trigger('click')
[10:10:05] <tbranyen> stupid lag on laptop
[10:10:42] <daninmass> can someone take a peak and tell me why my replace function isnt replacing the string I am specifying? - http://jsfiddle.net/55S5t/1/
[10:10:47] <WebDragon> stacks: $("#target").html(txt).end().show('slow') ?
[10:11:09] <stacks> why end
[10:11:19] <devinrolsen> yeah why the end()
[10:11:19] <WebDragon> just curious to see whether that fixes it
[10:11:21] <devinrolsen> no need.
[10:11:24] <WebDragon> no? ok
[10:11:25] <devinrolsen> you are still pointing to the object.
[10:11:34] <WebDragon> wasn't sure if html altered where things were pointed
[10:11:44] <WebDragon> that answers my own question lol
[10:11:46] <devinrolsen> souldn't
[10:12:02] <stacks> but i still dont get a show()
[10:12:10] <solidus-river> my .hover on mouse out function is not bieng called it doesn't seem
[10:12:39] <daninmass> is the result of .val() a string or an object?
[10:12:45] <WebDragon> devinrolsen: body .menucontents .menusection { display: block !important; } works
[10:12:46] <solidus-river> case mitchmach in the function naming
[10:12:52] <devinrolsen> awesome!
[10:12:59] <WebDragon> schweet. no workaround needed
[10:13:02] <WebDragon> always nice
[10:13:10] <devinrolsen> little sad it had to be three elements in the css selector.
[10:13:14] <daninmass> ?
[10:13:15] <Aple> Hey guys. On click, can I add a GET value to a URL?
[10:13:24] <devinrolsen> but for override of inline, it just has to be that way most of the tim.e
[10:13:26] <WebDragon> now I just gotta break 'em up into 3 menu pages, insert the css/js
[10:13:26] <devinrolsen> time*
[10:13:38] <WebDragon> wrap with header/footer, and bang zoom
[10:13:51] <og01> hey i've taken the combobox example from autocomplete widget, http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox and i'm trying to adjust it so that it can accept an option not in the list here is my current version: http://pastebin.com/escufBv6 can anybody help me out?
[10:13:55] <WebDragon> then I can get back to developing on the new wordpress site we're going to replace this aging monstrosity with
[10:13:57] <Aple> For instance, if user fills out name input with "John" and they click, "Next", can I add "&name=John" to the URL?
[10:14:03] <WebDragon> X-D
[10:14:19] <devinrolsen> I just lold my self.
[10:14:35] <daninmass> can someone take a peak and tell me why my replace function isnt replacing the string I am specifying? - http://jsfiddle.net/55S5t/1/  Thanks, I really need a second pair of eyes on this
[10:14:49] <dinosaadeh> guys does $(function() take into consideration that images within the document loaded?
[10:16:56] <stacks> $('#targetDiv').html('<p>text</p>').show('slow');     why this dont work for me argh?
[10:18:51] <WebDragon> stacks: it's .targetDiv not #targetDiv ?
[10:19:15] <WebDragon> i've done that on occasion *embarassed look*
[10:19:15] <stacks> its #targetDiv
[10:19:25] <WebDragon> definitely an id not a class
[10:19:32] <stacks> yes
[10:19:43] <WebDragon> how are you hiding it?
[10:20:09] <WebDragon> display: none; in the css file? or style="display: none;" in the markup ?
[10:20:10] <stacks> its a ajax request.. bevore its not hidden
[10:20:42] <WebDragon> it's an ajax request -- is the #targetDiv created by the javascript?
[10:21:41] <stacks> no
[10:21:45] <WebDragon> any errors show up in the console ? page validates cleanly as html4.01/5 css2.1/3 ?
[10:21:50] <Guest83959> Sigh...
[10:21:56] <Guest83959> Is Datepicker Create borken?

[10:22:07] <stacks> w8
[10:22:35] <Guest83959> 4 line test case.... I think create is broken, can someone confirm or deny for me
[10:22:56] <Aple> Say I've got this: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/446864/
[10:23:19] <Aple> And this: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/446865/
[10:23:41] <Aple> So basically I'm trying to fade out the current .question element on button click, and fade in the next .question element.
[10:23:52] <magicbronson> $('time').timeago() doesn't seem to use jQuery.live - any <time> elements I add to the DOM after I call it don't get applied to. Is there a fix for this? Sorry for the noob question.
[10:23:55] <magicbronson> http://timeago.yarp.com/
[10:23:56] <Aple> I suspect my JS line 3 syntax is messed up
[10:24:38] <Guest83959> :/
[10:24:39] <Aple> What traversing function should I use to get that next .question div in the list?
[10:25:37] <magneticss> Do Jquery Devs hang out in here?
[10:25:53] <magicbronson> looks like http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery is what i need
[10:26:44] <ajpiano> sort of, why do you ask magneticss
[10:27:21] <Aple> nm, $(this).closest('.question').next().show(); works
[10:27:33] <magneticss> ajpiano: becasue I'm fairly sure this is a bag.
[10:27:36] <magneticss> s/bag/bug/
[10:27:40] <magneticss> like 95% sure
[10:27:46] <magneticss> maybe 67%
[10:27:48] <magneticss> 97%
[10:28:42] <ajpiano> what is ??
[10:28:54] <magneticss> this should absolutely work: one way or the other: http://jsfiddle.net/TKabv/3/
[10:28:58] <magneticss> ajpiano: ^
[10:29:10] <wesada> How can I re-fire this $('.removeRow').button() when new objects with the removeRow class are added to the page?
[10:29:48] <ajpiano> ugh, magneticss... stupid datepicker isn't widget factory compliant
[10:30:03] <ajpiano> :/
[10:30:05] <magneticss> ajpiano: what does that mean? Sorry, I don't know much of jquery/ui internals.
[10:30:28] <magneticss> ajpiano: Or, do you have any idea how I could work around this quickly by chance?
[10:30:29] <ajpiano> all of the widgets in jquery ui are based off of something called the ui widget factory
[10:30:46] <ajpiano> which creates those methods and events and stuff that gives everything a consistent api and the events like that
[10:30:59] <ajpiano> but the datepicker is the only noncompliant one
[10:30:59] <ajpiano> hmm
[10:31:03] <magneticss> I see, and datepicker hasn't been updated to it
[10:31:13] <ben_alman> any recommendation for a JS date formatter plugin?
[10:32:23] <ajpiano> ben_alman: http://www.javascripttoolbox.com/lib/date/source.php
[10:33:32] <iii_> hi everyon
[10:34:17] <iii_> I got a problem with $.ajax() and IE. In the IE my Ajax-Requests fails with message "No Transport". In Firefox and Chrome everything works fine. Any ideas?
[10:34:29] <magneticss> ajpiano: I could attach a click listener to the textfield
[10:34:36] <magneticss> and then setTimeout for half a second
[10:34:44] <ajpiano> magneticss, why do you need the create event to work
[10:34:45] <magneticss> and then eexcute my create func body
[10:34:50] <ajpiano> via both methods
[10:35:05] <magneticss> ajpiano: when it fires,  swap the month and year fields around
[10:35:05] <ajpiano> oh wow, it straight up doesn't work at all
[10:35:10] <magneticss> ajpiano: neither work :P
[10:35:16] <monk12> is there an easy way in jQuery to get the date but '0' dates/months? like 06/06/2011 Date's .getMonth and getDate() return 1 based. Guess i could setup an if/else for each to look for <10
[10:35:39] <monk12> and pre-pend '0'. thought maybe something quick to do this.
[10:35:52] <swiggy> one day devinrolsen, one day...
[10:35:55] <swiggy> is there a way with JQuery UI Sortable/Draggable to select MULTIPLE items to drag/sort instead of just 1?
[10:36:06] <a|i> how to delete $(window).resize() events after binding?
[10:36:20] <devinrolsen> one day what?
[10:36:25] <ajpiano> monk12 any date formatting lib will help you with that
[10:36:26] <Nitrxgen> a|i, .unbind ?
[10:36:52] <monk12> k, thanks. Any good js client libs for that?
[10:37:16] <ajpiano> magneticss, check if any of the other datepicker events might be useful to you
[10:37:19] <aghouseh> is there a way to constrain the siblings() function to exclude the source (this)
[10:37:29] <aghouseh> so basically.. parent() 'other' siblings
[10:38:18] <magneticss> ajpiano: already ddi that :[
[10:38:36] <kborchers> aghouseh: siblings doesn't include the selected element
[10:38:42] <ajpiano> aghouseh, siblings doesn't include the original element in the result set
[10:38:44] <aghouseh> oh, hm. ok.
[10:39:05] <kborchers> beat you that time ajpiano ;)
[10:39:05] <aghouseh> im doing .parent().siblings(), that still would not return it?
[10:39:05] <ajpiano> magneticss, well at the very least, use a focus event instead of a click :p
[10:39:43] <kborchers> aghouseh: i don't think it should, no
[10:39:48] <aghouseh> ok thx
[10:39:53] <Nitrxgen> something around .parent().siblinds().not($(this)) perhaps?
[10:40:01] <Nitrxgen> if it does
[10:40:10] <Nitrxgen> excuse tyypos
[10:40:12] <Nitrxgen> fuck
[10:40:16] <Bwen> is there a way where I could retrieve a single attribute from all elements? And have it return a list of those attributes?
[10:40:22] <ajpiano> yeah, not(whatever) will be useful
[10:40:36] <magneticss> ajpiano: okay, the click worked, but I'll change it to focus, thanks.
[10:40:46] <aghouseh> that might do the trick, thank you.
[10:40:55] <Nitrxgen> Bwen, .each and store the attribute into an array?
[10:41:47] <Bwen> Nitrxgen: well yeah, but cant do it in one line?
[10:42:56] <ajpiano> Bwen: use .map
[10:43:13] <ajpiano> var foo = $(".bar").map(function() {  return $(this).attr("baz"); }).get();
[10:43:38] <Bwen> interresting i'll look into it :)
[10:43:50] <ajpiano> ?g when to use jquery's map methods
[10:43:51] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery.map()  jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[10:44:33] <iii_> I got a problem with $.ajax() and IE. In the IE my Ajax-Requests fails with message "No Transport". In Firefox and Chrome everything works fine.  - Still no ideas?
[10:45:02] <Anyvie> IE 8+ ?
[10:45:56] <iii_> y
[10:46:07] <zoned> <div id='myDiv'>some stuff</div>          how do i add some html right after "myDiv" ??
[10:46:13] <iii_> 8.0.600.....
[10:46:24] <Anyvie> $("#myDiv").after("data");
[10:46:33] <zoned> well, that was easy.
[10:46:37] <Anyvie> :)
[10:46:40] <zoned> i feel like i need a staples button
[10:46:42] <zoned> thx
[10:46:43] <Anyvie> iii_> No idea, sorry
[10:47:01] <Nitrxgen> iii_, sauce?
[10:49:44] <cf_PhillipSenn> I'll be doing an online talk about http://www.cfmzengarden.com/jQueryMatrix/ on August 4th.
[10:50:27] <Zeddy> http://jsbin.com/acopez/3 anyone care to tell me why the position is only updated once on my android? :\
[10:50:53] <iii_> Nitrxgen http://pastebin.com/pLqzmK4h  when u need more, just ask for it
[10:52:13] <iii_> Nitrxgen in FF the success function gets triggered, in IE (on the first load) always the error function. When i reload (F5) in IE, everything works fine.
[10:52:40] <paq> when you are on windows server, I guess you have to enter href='some-dir\some-file.txt'
[10:58:52] <wookiehangover> with jquery-ui selectmenu, is it possible to set the value of the UI select with the codez
[10:59:06] <wookiehangover> like, without triggering a click or anything dumb like that
[11:00:00] <poppiez> I'm trying to validate the callback key jQuery sends when using JSONP. what's the maximum amount of chars callback can be? sometimes it's 41, 42 etc.
[11:00:26] <kborchers> wookiehangover: $("selectMenuElement").val("yourValue");
[11:01:34] <wookiehangover> kborchers: thanks, but for jquery ui selectmenu
[11:01:40] <swiggy> is there a way with JQuery UI Sortable/Draggable to select MULTIPLE items to drag/sort instead of just 1?
[11:03:20] <kborchers> wookiehangover: there is no supported selectmenu in UI. is this a plugin, the filamentgroup version, the one that is in development?
[11:03:52] <wookiehangover> ya, its the plugin
[11:04:11] <Bwen> I cant use a css property in my jquery selector?
[11:04:32] <Anyvie> I don't think so
[11:05:08] <kborchers> wookiehangover: do you have the link to that plugin's site? i think i remember that and he was asked to not call it jQuery UI Selectmenu to avoid the confusion we just had
[11:05:35] <Anyvie> But you can do a .each(function () { if ($(this).css('XX') == "YY") { /*success*/ } }); <-- But it's a bit ugly.
[11:05:47] <wookiehangover> kborchers: felix
[11:05:55] <Bwen> yeah its fine, i'll just assign it a class :p
[11:06:01] <wookiehangover> 's is the semi-supported version
[11:06:03] <Anyvie> :)
[11:06:33] <kborchers> wookiehangover: so not the plugin, the one that's in development ;)
[11:06:55] <kborchers> this one http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[11:07:16] <wookiehangover> yes
[11:07:30] <kborchers> i guess his is technically still a plugin though :p
[11:07:37] <wookiehangover> ummm ya
[11:09:12] <wookiehangover> so I just need to call the refresh method on it
[11:09:21] <wookiehangover> after I change the value of the original select
[11:09:25] <wookiehangover> how do?
[11:11:22] <kborchers> wookiehangover: hmmm, you could try $("selectElement").trigger("change");
[11:14:44] <zoned> i am creating a bunch of radio buttons in a for loop. i add a .click handler for each button. but, when i click the button, it calls my .click function 10 times (my foor loop goes from 0-9), but i don't understand why that happens?
[11:15:20] <kborchers> ?p @ zoned
[11:15:21] <bot-t> zoned, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:15:21] <wookiehangover> kborchers: the correct answer it $('select').val('whatever').selectmenu()
[11:15:45] <kborchers> wookiehangover: so you just rebuild the selectmenu?
[11:16:04] <zoned> kborchers: it's the same code you fixed before, i just added $(radio).click(function(e){updatePart();});
[11:16:33] <kborchers> zoned: what's in updatePart ?
[11:17:18] <zoned> $('.partDesc').html('some stuff'));
[11:17:21] <zoned> it adds "some stuff" 10x
[11:17:26] <zoned> to my div
[11:17:54] <kborchers> zoned: can you paste a link to your code again
[11:19:38] <zoned> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/44b2K1T6
[11:20:19] <kborchers> zoned: it's because you're binding 10 times.
[11:20:32] <zoned> but they're 10 different buttons
[11:20:37] <kborchers> your selector is selecting all input's every time you loop
[11:20:50] <zoned> so why doesn't it set their attributes 10 times over as well?
[11:21:11] <Guest42782> if i call $(this).attr('appName') does <a appname="appname" work?
[11:21:16] <Guest42782> or is it case sensitive
[11:21:16] <kborchers> because the attr just gets overwritten 10 times
[11:21:27] <k1t> or is it case sensitive?
[11:21:33] <k1t> or is that browser dependent
[11:21:37] <k1t> sorry for flood lol
[11:22:21] <zoned> kborchers: how should i select just the current button i'm adding?
[11:22:40] * kborchers is thinking it through
[11:22:51] <molavy> why when i use this code $("#container").html($("alertbox");
[11:23:21] <molavy> it put [object Object] into container
[11:23:39] <zoned> k1t: does this help? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-case-insensitive-selector
[11:24:03] <pinholecamera> hey folks, how goes it?
[11:24:19] <molavy> $("#alertbox") is a option element form
[11:24:19] <shesek> Does anybody know of a case where some browser adds multiple '#' to the URL?
[11:24:42] <Double_Rainbow> hello guys
[11:24:57] <pinholecamera> i'm having a little trouble getting this dropdown script to work in IE7... works great everywhere else
[11:24:57] <ryanneufeld> Double_Rainbow: ALL THE WAY
[11:24:59] <molavy> any idea?
[11:25:16] <k1t> zoned: ah yeah a bit, i was reading over that.. thinkin my problem lies elseware
[11:25:19] <k1t> elsewhere
[11:25:28] <pinholecamera> essentially it recognizes the hover action but isn't talking to the .dropdown class, can't find it i suppose
[11:25:29] <Double_Rainbow> hey how do i get all the div with id ="word" and then apply a class to each of them individually?
[11:25:30] <pinholecamera> http://pastebin.com/DJ8F24iC
[11:25:54] <pinholecamera> Double_Rainbow: you mean $("#word").addClass("myNewClass"); ?
[11:26:20] <Double_Rainbow> yes but it gets more complicated
[11:26:27] <pinholecamera> Double_Rainbow: you could also do that with $('#word').each(function() { but not sure why you would
[11:26:32] <Double_Rainbow> each time i need to add a random class to it
[11:26:34] <kborchers> Double_Rainbow: you should have only one div with id="word". id's are unique
[11:26:36] <ryanneufeld> Double_Rainbow:
[11:26:42] <ryanneufeld> Double_Rainbow: id's should be unique
[11:26:43] <Double_Rainbow> doh!
[11:26:46] <pinholecamera> kborchers: haha, good point, i didn't even notice
[11:26:48] <Double_Rainbow> damm
[11:26:53] <ryanneufeld> Double_Rainbow: use claass instead
[11:27:01] <Double_Rainbow> the thing is those words are dynamically geenrated
[11:27:16] <Double_Rainbow> and each word need to have a unique font style
[11:27:30] <ryanneufeld> you can use classes
[11:27:41] <ryanneufeld> give them all the same class
[11:27:51] <Double_Rainbow> ryanneufeld: then ?
[11:27:55] <molavy> there is no idea?
[11:27:58] <Double_Rainbow> how do i change the font
[11:28:01] <molavy> why when i use this code $("#container").html($("alertbox");
[11:28:05] <ryanneufeld> use $('.class').each*(
[11:28:06] <molavy> it put [object Object] into container
[11:28:08] <ryanneufeld> *each()
[11:28:12] <molavy> $("#alertbox") is a option element form
[11:28:13] <zoned> kborchers: i tried just adding the 'onclick' attribute, but it says updatePart() is undefined? is that because updatePart would have to be just a standard js function outside of the $(function(){ then ?
[11:28:33] <Double_Rainbow> molavy: you did not close ));
[11:28:59] <solidus-river> hmm, is data saved per id or per element?
[11:29:12] <molavy> there is no exact code .
[11:29:15] <hipsterairman> Hello! Is anyone here experienced in making CouchDB apps with jQuery mobile?
[11:29:41] <molavy> how can i put all of option element into container
[11:30:21] <molavy> i want it put <option id="alertbox">text<option>
[11:30:27] <molavy> into container
[11:30:58] <pinholecamera> so anyone know why this hover function would not work in IE7? perhaps IE7 doesn't like $('.dropdown:eq(0)', this).show(); with the child <ul> inside of another <li>?
[11:31:13] <molavy> Double_Rainbow,any idea?
[11:31:56] <Double_Rainbow> molavy: sorry, i have my own worries, like what to feed the baby ogres tonight
[11:33:21] <solidus-river> http://pastebin.com/V8r2r1Di
[11:33:44] <solidus-river> that is a problem every data element is the same :\ how do i attached a unique ide to an ul of images
[11:33:57] <solidus-river> i want to keep track of the id in an array that the image is associated with for a click handler
[11:34:04] <molavy> there is no idea?
[11:34:54] <molavy> there is no idea?
[11:35:08] <solidus-river> molavy: you can search for all option elements and append them to the container
[11:36:52] <molavy> there is no differ between $("#container").html($("alertbox"); and $("#container").html("");$("#container").append($("alertbox"); it dont put option element into container
[11:37:42] <zoned> kborchers: i still can't figure out a good way to solve this.. any ideas? thanks
[11:37:52] <molavy> any idea?
[11:38:32] <kborchers> zoned: yes, your function should be outside of $(function(). That will probably fix your problem. You should also see ?data as you should not create random attributes on your elements
[11:38:32] <bot-t> zoned, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[11:39:55] <molavy> there is no idea?

[11:44:22] <zoned> kborchers: it is still an inefficient way to create the buttons if the attributes are being overwritten n times... is there a good way around this?
[11:45:52] <SkyFlyer> I'm using an external script for AddThis sharing tool.  I need to call the normal click to open up the window via a script.  is there a way to do a click on an id? so that its the standard behavior for that link?
[11:46:37] <kborchers> zoned: try creating your radio var radio = $("<input type='radio' name='yourName' id='yourID' />"); then add your .data to radio, then do your bind on radio. i think that should work better.
[11:46:49] <pinholecamera> aha
[11:46:57] <Double_Rainbow> i have a class world
[11:47:01] <pinholecamera> IE7 doesn't like display:block, a la .show()
[11:47:06] <Double_Rainbow> how do i do a .each on it?
[11:47:18] <kborchers> .click @ SkyFlyer

[11:47:49] <Double_Rainbow> thanks
[11:48:23] <SkyFlyer> sweet i'lll try this:  $('#target').click();
[11:48:34] <zoned> kborchers: that still doesn't solve the click problem, though
[11:49:27] <Zeddy> seriously, someone tell me why html5 watchposition only updates once? :(
[11:49:48] <kborchers> zoned: sorry, append it to the li before you bind and see if that helps. otherwise, i'll need a ?demo to help more
[11:49:57] <kborchers> ?demo @ zoned

[11:50:00] <pinholecamera> oh no, i'm wrong
[11:50:03] <pinholecamera> it's still not working
[11:50:08] <pinholecamera> was looking at IE9 mode
[11:50:15] <pinholecamera> bummer.
[11:50:42] <zoned> kborchers: should i append the li to the form before or after the bind? or doesn't matter?
[11:51:15] <kborchers> zoned: not sure, try both ;)
[12:01:41] <molavy> ok,i use .clone() and it work well

[12:03:54] <c0mputer> Frequently I find myself calling multiple instances of a jquery plugin using the exact same settings. Is there a way to create a settings variable and pass that variable to my jquery  plugin function? It never seems to work. Something like var settings = {  someSetting: true };
[12:05:08] <c0mputer> My thinking is that if I have 30 instances of a jquery plugin on a page, it might speed up rendering a little bit?
[12:05:52] <Vorspire> It would be more efficient on a minute scale, you're talking a few bytes per option object
[12:06:21] <Vorspire> although it would make it much easier for you to change them globally
[12:06:27] <c0mputer> Hmm. Okay. Knowing that, how can I make something like that more efficient?
[12:06:45] <c0mputer> I have a php script that is creating a calendar object. Each day in the calendar spits out a jqPlot instance of a chart with a series plotted on it.
[12:07:02] <c0mputer> Naturally, there will be 30 instances of jqPlot on the page.
[12:07:07] <c0mputer> Is there a better way of doing something like this?
[12:07:20] <odie5533> is there an alternative to .get() which returns the jQuery element instead of a DOM element?
[12:07:31] <ajpiano> ?eq @ odie5533 @ #jquery
[12:07:32] <bot-t> odie5533, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[12:07:36] <Double_Rainbow> !addclass
[12:07:39] <Double_Rainbow> ?addclass
[12:07:39] <bot-t> .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[12:07:52] <Double_Rainbow> i can haz bot?
[12:08:00] <odie5533> ajpiano: thank you. I didn't see it linked on the .get() page and that was the only thing I found anywhere
[12:08:22] <ajpiano> hm
[12:08:31] <odie5533> it's the first comment though :X
[12:08:31] <ajpiano> yo'ure right it wouldn't be a bad idea to link to it from the get page
[12:08:49] <c0mputer> Vorspire: it basically lets me see a trendline for each day of the month based on the electricity usage in my house. is there no way of speeding up execution?
[12:08:56] <Vorspire> c0mputer, I'm not familiar with jqPlot
[12:09:42] <ajpiano> c0mputer: the ideal solution would be to embed the parameters for each day as metadata on the calendar elements
[12:09:49] <ajpiano> and have the jqplot or whatnot re-render itself using that data
[12:09:54] <Double_Rainbow> omg its ajpiano!!!!
[12:09:54] <ajpiano> and only have one instance per page
[12:09:55] <Vorspire> all code ever written can always be optimized in some way I believe, what you're asking is far too ambiguous to reference a starting point :P
[12:10:11] <ajpiano> AN AJPIANO APPEARS
[12:10:22] * Vorspire ducks for cover *
[12:10:50] <Double_Rainbow> i played pokemon
[12:10:54] <Double_Rainbow> loosely
[12:11:59] <c0mputer> Vorspire: ajpiano http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=CphK0yND is basically what i'm doing now.
[12:12:24] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:12:27] * geekbuntu *tada* we all bow for the piano
[12:12:32] <ajpiano> i mean... the same advice i gave applies
[12:12:47] <ajpiano> i don't have time this minute to explain how you'd do it and i've never worked with jqplot
[12:13:05] <Aple> How do I set focus on certain elements after an action? Eg: "Click 'Next' button #1" -> "Set focus to 'Next' button #2".
[12:13:07] <Aple> http://pressedweb.com/samples/ajax_survey/
[12:13:14] <Aple> If you hit "Enter" it just submits the form
[12:13:20] <ajpiano> but abstractly you would just embed the dynamic information in the dom... and fetch it and use it to rerender the chart
[12:14:12] <fris> Aple looks like you need some form validation so you cant submit unles you enter something
[12:15:12] <c0mputer> ajpiano: that's faster than passing object syntax?
[12:15:26] <ajpiano> wat
[12:15:41] <ajpiano> having one instance of jqplot on the page with one set of options
[12:15:46] <ajpiano> and dynamically updating it based on some data
[12:15:57] <ajpiano> is probably faster than having 30 instances and generating javascript on the server, yes.
[12:16:07] <c0mputer> oh i understand what you meant now
[12:16:25] <Aple> fris: Yeah, going to add that, but still would like the "Next" button to take the user to the next question
[12:16:25] <c0mputer> well, i need 30 canvases
[12:16:28] <c0mputer> its a calendar
[12:16:39] <Aple> fris: Instead of just sending them to some "Sorry, you haven't filled in 99% of the form" page
[12:17:00] <Aple> fris: So need to figure out how to set focus to those "Next" buttons as they appear
[12:17:04] <ajpiano> ..if you say so, i don't know your impl
[12:17:56] <c0mputer> ajpiano: each 'day' in the calendar has to load a different series of plot points. each day has a different graph. loads the entire month view at once.
[12:18:18] <ajpiano> oh
[12:18:35] <ajpiano> so you actually need all 30 at the same time
[12:18:40] <c0mputer> right
[12:18:47] <ajpiano> you could probably still do that
[12:18:51] <ajpiano> with a loop on the client side
[12:18:59] <ajpiano> you'd still have 30 instances
[12:19:11] <ajpiano> but you wouldn't have the entire code block repeated in the output 30 times
[12:19:25] <zhannes> Hi all, i'm looking for some validation on the plugin patterns popularized by Alex Sexton and Paul Irish. Namely, moving the definition of the plugin's functionality into a separate function or object literal. As opposed to using a lot of nested anonymous functions and loops, when you assign into the jquery namespace, $.fn. Is there any reason not to take the approach they are advocating?
[12:20:30] <ajpiano> there is no reason not to take that approach
[12:21:57] <ajpiano> unless you really like soupy code
[12:22:12] <zhannes> ajpiano: do you see anything wrong with moving even the implementation of the iteration into it's own function? Then assigning that into the namespace?
[12:22:16] <c0mputer> ajpiano: not real sure on the specifics of what you're suggesting. I call my plugin like this: $.jqplot ('calendarchart$this_day', points_to_chart, { listOf: settings{} }); what are you suggesting I do?
[12:23:29] <ajpiano> zhannes: i'm not 100% sure what you're referring to specifically, but in general there would be nothing wrong with that ... the less work each particular function does, the better
[12:23:46] <Aple> Is there any way to test and see if an input field is currently active?
[12:24:13] <ajpiano> c0mputer: i'm suggesting you insert the actual chart data inside each calendar cell or whatnot
[12:24:42] <c0mputer> ajpiano: like, in a span tag or something?
[12:24:49] <ajpiano> and then do like $("div.date").each(function() { var chartData = $(this).data("whatever");  $.jqPlot(blah, blah, chartdata, blah);   });
[12:24:56] <ajpiano> as data attribute(s) on the element
[12:24:59] <kborchers> ?:focus @ Aple
[12:24:59] <bot-t> Aple, http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-dev/browse_thread/thread/67ede2e034ab62f3/def5b2207b99a731
[12:25:03] <kborchers> doh
[12:25:06] <ajpiano> you could either store multiple data attributes or store a serialized json string
[12:25:06] <zhannes> ajpiano: like this roughly https://gist.github.com/1107713
[12:25:10] <kborchers> Aple: http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[12:25:27] <c0mputer> ajpiano: will that actually save execution time as opposed to just dropping the data directly into the plot function with php?
[12:25:52] <c0mputer> ajpiano: each chart has ~80 data points
[12:26:00] <ajpiano> it's considerably more elegant imo
[12:26:06] <ajpiano> to only serialize the actual data points
[12:26:17] <ajpiano> than it is to include duplicates of all the config options and the document ready function 30 times
[12:26:25] <odie5533> How do I select only elements with a text that matches a regular expression?
[12:26:28] <ajpiano> either way, you're calling jqplot 30 times
[12:27:03] <c0mputer> ajpiano: will the -data attribute work in IE?
[12:27:09] <ajpiano> zhannes: that's fine... me personally, i probably wouldn't bother having a separate function
[12:27:40] <ajpiano> i would just do $.fn.fader = function(options) { return this.each(function() { $(this).data("fader", new Fader(options));  });  }
[12:27:55] <ajpiano> or i would use the widget factory ;)
[12:28:26] <ajpiano> which is probably what alex and paul would suggest you do if you had a use case that would benefit from it, which it appears you do
[12:28:41] <Aple> God dammit
[12:28:58] <ajpiano> c0mputer: yes
[12:29:14] <Aple> Form keeps submitting everytime I hit enter
[12:29:26] <Aple> I want it to just go to the next question rather than submit the whole form
[12:30:16] <little> Is there a way to go back to UI ThemeRoller and reload a custom theme  ... in order to tweak it and re down load
[12:30:20] <sharamiTOD> IAny way to get a cluetip (or tooltip) to work with dynamically generated content (with array variables passed via wordpress)?
[12:30:50] <ajpiano> little, yes, the theme URL is embedded inside of the theme file you downloaded originally
[12:30:55] <ajpiano> you can just go to tha turl and pick off where you left off
[12:31:28] <little> Oh good
[12:34:44] <kryl> ok or, is it possible to post object or array from json (jquery) to struts ? :)
[12:35:19] <Justin___> Could anyone help out with this please? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6835046/get-the-jquery-autoscroll-plugin-to-destroy-scroller-when-reaching-a-specified-nu/6835243#6835243
[12:35:26] <little> ajpiano, where do i find that url that can reload the sytles?
[12:35:38] <Justin___> I'm trying to get an autoscroller to stop scrolling at a specified number of pixels from the top
[12:35:44] <kborchers> kryl: you can not post an object over http. you will have to serialize it to a string before you can post it
[12:35:57] <ajpiano> little it should be in your ui.theme.css
[12:37:44] <kryl> kborchers, I understand that but how jquery will send more advanced json data ? (like array)
[12:37:55] <little> ajpiano, Thanks got it
[12:38:46] <kryl> it appears to be lists%5B%5D=test1&lists%5B%5D=test2
[12:39:11] <kryl> but it return an OGNL error in java !
[12:40:02] <kborchers> kryl: that is sending it as lists[]=test1&lists[]=test2. if java can't handle that, then you'll need to serialize it another way. PHP sees that and converts them into an array that you can use
[12:41:58] <kryl> kborchers, I see
[12:42:03] <kryl> thx u
[12:46:24] <Aple> Best method for very basic form validation?
[12:46:47] <Aple> (just talking "Did you fill it out or is it empty?!" validation here)
[12:48:40] <chubz> i can't seem to get the .click() handler working on a very simple page, can somebody help me? ): http://jsfiddle.net/XEGA9/1/
[12:48:41] <og01> Aple: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[12:50:27] <Aple> og01: I'm probably being an idiot, but I can't find the download link :)
[12:50:33] <Aple> Is it just bundled with jQuery?
[12:51:11] <solidus-river> Aple: putting the javascript in the javascript place and using jquery and not mootools as the framework helps ;)
[12:51:11] <og01> Aple: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[12:51:23] <solidus-river> http://jsfiddle.net/XEGA9/3/
[12:51:41] <solidus-river> i mean
[12:51:43] <solidus-river> chubz:
[12:52:03] <solidus-river> chubz: http://jsfiddle.net/XEGA9/3/ you werent using jquery and you didn't put the javascript in the javascriptsection
[12:52:15] <chubz> oh god derp
[12:52:16] <chubz> thanks so much
[12:53:00] <solidus-river> chubz: np, happens
[12:53:33] <chubz> solidus-river: so what happens if i want the js to be inline with the html file?
[12:53:45] <kborchers> chubz: you can't assign a handler to an element until it exists in the dom http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/XEGA9/4/
[12:54:51] <chubz> kborchers: thanks so much
[12:55:35] <s3d_matt> Hi All. Im using fancy box (in wordpress) and on the first click, the lightbox is not centered on screen. On a repeated click, it is properly centered
[12:55:39] <s3d_matt> any ideas what that could be?
[12:59:37] <zoned> is there a command i can use to wait for an ajax call to finish before continuing executing the js code?
[13:00:43] <sharamiTOD> Has anyone used delgate or live Jquery calls in reference to dynamic data from your Wordpress site?
[13:00:54] <kborchers> zoned: that defeats the whole purpose of the A (asynchronous) in AJAX
[13:01:10] <zoned> technically i'm using $.post, not $.ajax
[13:01:15] <Justin___> I created this jsfiddle so people can test out the autoscroll jquery plugin. I'm trying to get the autoscroll to stop scrolling at a specific number of pixels from the top, but it's not working: http://jsfiddle.net/meltzerj/uu95w/6/
[13:01:26] <kborchers> zoned: that still uses .ajax behind the scenes
[13:02:08] <zoned> kborchers: my ajax call populates my form with some data, afterwards i need to modify this data, but for some reason i cannot select it.. because it hasn't actually been populated yet
[13:03:03] <kborchers> zoned: then you need to modify that data in the success callback of .post
[13:03:10] <kborchers> ?post @ zoned
[13:03:11] <bot-t> zoned, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[13:03:40] <SlexAxton> zhannes: around?
[13:04:02] <zoned> $.post("./ajax/nextStep.php",{'step':nextStep, 'model':model}, function(data){ // inside here right?
[13:04:26] <kborchers> zoned: yes
[13:04:43] <mrittman> I'm expanding and contracting divs with jQuery. I'm getting a jump with text with this. Can someone show me what I'm doing wrong?
[13:04:44] <mrittman> http://www.info2gousa.com/displaypress
[13:04:51] <zhannes> SlexAxton: yup
[13:04:58] <SlexAxton> zhannes: still have questions?
[13:04:59] <mrittman> click on Packages on the right sidebar
[13:05:08] <mrittman> then expand "Basic Pricing"
[13:05:44] <gf3> DON'T CLICK IT
[13:05:48] <gf3> IT'S A TRAP
[13:05:50] <gf3> ALSO A VIRUS
[13:06:42] <zhannes> SlexAxton: thanks, i'm good. I don't have a specific use case in mind. Just trying to get my team to write cleaner code. I've read a few of your articles/presos advocating that pattern, but can't find a lot of others advocating it. So i was just wondering if there was some reason not to use it. Seems super clean to me
[13:06:45] <smplstk> gf3: http://ecdn3.hark.com/images/000/001/085/1085/original.jpg
[13:06:56] <kborchers> mrittman: might have something to do with the empty paragraph you have in there
[13:07:02] <gf3> smplstk: EXACTLY
[13:07:26] <mrittman> hmmm
[13:07:50] <mrittman> gotta love Wordpress with it inserting paragraphs where you don't want them
[13:08:44] <zhannes> SlexAxton: actually, how would you decide to use widget factory, as @ajpiano mentioned
[13:09:52] <Guest8800> hello - any jquery experts here interested in a little payed work ?
[13:13:54] <SlexAxton> zhannes: widget factory is a nice implementation of the type of things that I wrote about and spoke about on the topic
[13:13:57] <SlexAxton> it's not exactly how i do it
[13:14:04] <SlexAxton> cause i don't like string function calls
[13:14:07] <SlexAxton> but outside of that
[13:14:17] <SlexAxton> it's pretty much the same
[13:14:48] <gf3> SlexAxton++
[13:14:56] <gf3> string function calls--
[13:15:10] <ajpiano> also having access to the methods as methods++
[13:15:29] <gf3> fuck you, chaining
[13:15:33] <zoned> kborchers: can you tell me why my 'partDescription' div gets the word 'stuff' in it 10 times? json.length alerts to 7, and my 'test' alert only goes off once. what gives?
[13:15:34] <gf3> I return instances, bitch
[13:15:39] <zoned> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/ESPMMGQg
[13:16:59] <m0dmd> hi everyone.
[13:17:14] <gf3> nope
[13:19:01] <zoned> can anyone explain why my partDescription div gets filled with the word 'stuff' 10 times? json.length alerts to 7 (there are only 7 radio buttons on the form), and my 'test' alert only goes off once. i'm confused...
[13:19:03] <zoned> http://pastebin.com/ESPMMGQg
[13:19:40] <kborchers> zoned: you need to assing unique id's to those radios. i think since they all have the same name, that change handler is being fired for all of them when one changes.
[13:19:47] <dragonnkh> hi - got cut off- so again - is there any jquery experts interested in a small piece of payed work ?
[13:19:53] <zoned> name is for the group
[13:20:08] <zoned> and even if that was the case, there'd be 7.. not 10.
[13:21:48] <zoned> kborchers: i've added this to the attributes: id:'step' + nextStep + 'Radio' + j, it makes no difference
[13:22:29] <dragonnkh> if anyone is interested in some cash in return for some jquery code - please let me know - I'll be here for another 15 mins
[13:22:41] <sharamiTOD> Does anyone here use the delegate or live Jquery command?
[13:22:53] <kborchers> zoned: do your bind inside the loop and select on id
[13:23:06] * lenswipe picks kborchers up
[13:24:14] * kborchers tells lenswipe to put me down ;)
[13:25:46] * lenswipe adds cowbell and puts kborchers down
[13:26:24] <swiggy> is there a way with JQuery UI Sortable/Draggable to select MULTIPLE items to drag/sort instead of just 1?
[13:27:25] * lenswipe throws things
[13:29:36] <kborchers> swiggy: don't think there is a native way to do it but this plugin might help though i have never used it http://plugins.jquery.com/project/multidraggable
[13:32:00] <swiggy> kborchers, do you know if it works with sortable?
[13:32:12] <swiggy> i need the items to be sorted - VERY important
[13:32:21] <kborchers> swiggy: not sure, never used it sorry
[13:32:30] <swiggy> :The only functionality I am aware of that currently does not work is the connectToSortable :
[13:32:31] <swiggy> :(
[13:33:57] <kborchers> swiggy: again never done this but you might be able to somehow use selectable with those http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/
[13:40:53] <ale_> Hello, can I use $(div).slideDown('slow').append('something'); ??
[13:42:11] <Aple> Anyone help with syntax?
[13:42:12] <Aple> if $('input').keydown(function(event) && $('input').closest('.question') != $('.q5') {
[13:42:37] <Aple> Trying to say, "If it's an input, and it's not the input in the div.q5, then..."
[13:42:48] <Anyvie> ;o
[13:42:59] <little> quit
[13:43:57] <Anyvie> hum
[13:44:26] <Anyvie> I think you should do function(event) { /* closest input condition */ }
[13:44:38] <sphinxxx> are there any channel for json?
[13:44:41] <Anyvie> I don't know if $(this) would work there
[13:50:20] <Aple> Cool
[13:50:30] <Aple> How do I test if something is empty?
[13:50:43] <Peter`> Turn it upside down and see if anything falls out?
[13:50:54] <Anyvie> == undefined, or == ''
[13:51:11] <Anyvie> Peter`> Love your think :)
[13:51:14] <Aple> For instance, I'd like to see if the 'input.enter' text fields are empty: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/447005/
[13:51:33] <Anyvie> if (input.enter.length > 0) ?
[13:53:23] <sphinxxx> anyone here familiar with google spreadsheets api and json?
[13:53:35] <Aple> Doesn't seem to be working: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/447007/
[13:53:52] <Aple> Keeps going to the next slide, even if it's empty
[13:54:00] <Anyvie> $('.enter').val().length
[13:54:07] <Anyvie> or $('.enter') != ''
[13:54:17] <Anyvie> .val() *
[13:55:13] <Aple> if ( $('.enter').val().length > 0 ) {
[13:55:15] <Aple> Same thing
[13:55:18] <Aple> Lemme try other method
[13:58:28] <Aple> Ok, kicking ass all over now
[13:58:31] <Aple> Anyvie++
[13:58:33] <Aple> Thanks man! ;)
[13:59:04] <Aple> You're the first person to actually help me today. Filthy rotten lazy scumbag #jquery, never giving me free help when I'm too stupid or lazy to figure it out myself.
[13:59:49] <Anyvie> :)
[14:05:18] <Aple> Can any of your wretched scum tell me where my syntax error is? if (event.keyCode == '13') && if ($('.submit').val() != '') {
[14:05:34] <Anyvie> if (() && ())
[14:05:36] * Aple plays the good, ol' reverse psychology card
[14:05:57] <Anyvie> instead of if () && if ()
[14:07:40] <Aple> Sweet
[14:07:53] <Aple> See!? Anyvie pickin' up everyone's slack
[14:08:11] <Anyvie> They're busy on harder problems.
[14:08:29] <Aple> For some reason it's still processing the form is 'input.submit' is empty: if ( (event.keyCode == '13') && ($('.submit').val() != '') ) {
[14:08:59] <Aple> Harder problems? Ha! Like what?!
[14:09:02] <Anyvie> ok, don't have enough code to help you, this one.
[14:09:16] <djQuery> Aple: what is .submit an input and what type of input?
[14:09:28] <Aple> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/447018/
[14:09:31] <djQuery> <input type="text" required>
[14:09:37] <Aple> djQuery: textbox
[14:09:53] <Aple> required? za?
[14:09:56] <Anyvie> after the $(this). ..
[14:10:05] <Anyvie> add : event.stopPropagation();
[14:10:16] <Anyvie> just before }
[14:11:35] <zhannes> SlexAxton et al, thanks. That was helpful.
[14:11:40] <djQuery> Aple: html5 inputs can have a required attribute. there are plenty of shims out there that will get the html5 input types to work in crappy err older browsers
[14:11:54] <Aple> Like so? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/447019/
[14:12:04] <Anyvie> modernizer
[14:12:22] <djQuery> Aple: like this http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html
[14:12:23] <Anyvie> Yeah Aple
[14:12:28] <Aple> Haven't stepped into modernizr yet. The more I get into JS, the more I will.
[14:12:32] <lazarus477> Anyone here on 6.22 and familiar with odd ins-and-outs of the Superfish module? I have it setup and all checks out but there is something fishy going on with the rendering.
[14:12:34] <Aple> Anyvie: Didn't work :(
[14:12:44] <Aple> Oh, what's a hot chick like me supposed to do?
[14:12:50] <djQuery> Aple: the point is that it takes it outa javascript and puts it in the html
[14:12:55] <Anyvie> lol.
[14:13:10] <Aple> djQuery: Looks awesome and I'll be sure to use that on my next project.
[14:13:17] <Aple> But this is literally the last thing I have to get right with this
[14:13:20] <Aple> And I'm done for the day
[14:13:21] <Anyvie> hum
[14:13:47] <Anyvie> } return false; });
[14:13:49] <Anyvie> try this
[14:13:58] <Anyvie> oop
[14:14:03] <Anyvie> return false; } });
[14:14:05] <heatxsink> Anyvie: doesn't that stop bubbling
[14:14:27] <djQuery> whats keydoce 13 return?
[14:14:27] <Anyvie> Yeah
[14:15:01] <heatxsink> djQuery: yes
[14:15:10] <Aple> Has to be something with the syntax of that first line
[14:15:19] <Aple> Works when I don't check .submit to see if it's empty.
[14:15:37] <Aple> So something in this line: if ( (event.keyCode == '13') && ($('.submit').val() != '') ) {
[14:15:46] <djQuery> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[14:15:59] <Aple> Maybe I'll just nest that if
[14:16:08] <kborchers> djQuery++
[14:16:15] <heatxsink> Aple: maybe it's === vs ==
[14:16:19] <Anyvie> djQuery++ too.
[14:17:00] <Aple> Nesting it just submitted it again.
[14:17:04] <Aple> hm
[14:17:17] <Aple> Don't think so heat, but I'll try
[14:17:31] <Aple> Yeah, didn't work
[14:17:47] <Anyvie> Aple
[14:17:57] <djQuery> kborchers: dont know how many time I have posted a blog link inhere and the owner of the blog showed up
[14:17:58] <Anyvie> Take a moment to read the djQuery's link
[14:18:34] <djQuery> Aple: is all this in a form tag?
[14:18:46] <Aple> djQuery yeah
[14:18:55] <djQuery> Aple: then why not just bind the to form submit.
[14:19:10] <djQuery> instead of the individual input
[14:19:28] <Aple> Would it make a diff?
[14:19:58] <djQuery> with the forms submit you can stop the form from submiting if all your rules arent correct.
[14:20:14] <djQuery> or you could impliment this in about 2 minutes. see ?validation
[14:20:14] <bot-t> djQuery, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[14:20:25] <Aple> Has to be something right here: $('.submit').val() != '')
[14:20:35] <Aple> It's not detecting that input.submit is empty
[14:20:54] <Anyvie> djQuery > He doesn't want to listen to you
[14:21:00] <djQuery> Aple: .val().length?
[14:21:09] <Aple> djQuery: The problem with the validation plugin is that I'm displaying question-by-question
[14:21:15] <djQuery> Aple: try see ?demo
[14:21:16] <bot-t> Aple, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:21:26] <Aple> And can't get it to validate each and every single question when I click to go to next question
[14:21:38] <Aple> djquery: 1 sec on demo
[14:21:43] <Aple> Lemme try length first
[14:21:48] <djQuery> Aple: so it works on blur so it could handle each question
[14:22:15] <acidjazz> im in some mode in firebug where every line is like evalutlated.. my conosle and script buttons are glowing orange .. hwo the FUCK DO I GET OUT OF THIS?? )

[14:22:22] <acidjazz> woops
[14:22:25] <djQuery> this is kinda cool

[14:22:50] <Aple> Ignores len too
[14:22:51] <djQuery> acidjazz: switch to chrome?
[14:22:53] <Aple> k 1 sec
[14:23:11] <kborchers> djQuery++ again ;)
[14:23:18] <acidjazz> djQuery: its gotta be some mode im in
[14:23:45] <NielsMob> may i ask a bit ot question about forms ... does anyone know a good doc on the forum that explains how to switch from table used forms to a div alternative style?
[14:24:42] <NielsMob> i need to switch because i want to use ui TABS within the form
[14:27:02] <chubz> hey. lets say i have a data grid with an array of static data. and i want to reproduce the same grid on the same webpage again with a click of a button. how do i go about doing so? i'm thinking that i should make the grid a variable, and create a button, and the button has a click function to make the grid, and everytime you click it, the same grid gets added onto the webpage
[14:28:03] <vitorino> Hi people
[14:28:21] <vitorino> I'm looking for any suggestion for parallax effect
[14:28:26] <Aple> djQuery: http://pressedweb.com/samples/ajax_survey/
[14:28:31] <djQuery> this is even cooler http://jsplumb.org/jquery/demo.html
[14:28:36] <swiggy> is there a way to get a file extention from <input type="file"> ??
[14:28:39] <cbobo> $('#vitorino').html("hey back at u");
[14:28:50] <swiggy> i want to check the extention of a file before they submit the form/upload a file
[14:29:10] <swiggy> i guess id just check the value of the element ID?
[14:29:11] <cbobo> swiggy, use onchange
[14:29:14] <swiggy> (i havent tested)
[14:29:17] <vitorino> cbobo: lol
[14:29:40] <cbobo> .change( function() { if bad format; kill user; etc etc; }
[14:29:40] <Aple> djQuery: Pretty sure it's Line 27's fault
[14:29:55] <djQuery> Aple: first off are u changing the input on each submit?
[14:30:07] <Aple> What do you mean?
[14:30:50] <chubz> hey. lets say i have a data grid with an array of static data. and i want to reproduce the same grid on the same webpage again with a click of a button. how do i go about doing so? i'm thinking that i should make the grid a variable, and create a button, and the button has a click function to make the grid, and everytime you click it, the same grid gets added onto the webpage
[14:30:53] <djQuery> Aple: ok I see you are just moving to the next question
[14:31:08] <vitorino> that's funny
[14:31:43] <swiggy> .change doesnt work on <input type="file"
[14:32:21] <tra> how can i stop an animation made with .effect()  if a user does something while the element is still animated?
[14:32:22] <vitorino> little monkey
[14:32:31] <kborchers> ?clone @ chubz
[14:32:31] <bot-t> chubz, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[14:32:40] <Aple> djQuery: Yeah, just hiding the old question, showing the next question, and keeping it all within the same form. But don't move forward to next question til old question has SOME val.
[14:32:55] <Aple> djQuery: Works great all the way up to the swallow question
[14:33:01] <Aple> Then you can leave it blank and it still submits
[14:33:07] <Aple> Because of line 27
[14:33:24] <Aple> Not being able to detect if "Enter" is pressed AND if val is empty.
[14:33:45] <vitorino> tra: tried .stop(true, true) is enought

[14:34:06] * bot-t sighs
[14:35:11] <lazarus477> Anyone run into problems where the superfish menus end up being cut off? It looks like the described IE Z-Index bug but I am getting the problem with Firefox and Chrome.
[14:35:21] <Aple> djQuery: seems like a lot to redo to implement the validation plugin. Tried to implement it before, but where I'm doing the "hide/show question" thing 1-by-1, it wasn't very efficient.
[14:36:00] <Aple> lazarus477: Make sure you aren't overflow:hidden; the menu
[14:36:28] <lazarus477> Aple: I shall try adding some css to ensure that, also I shall inspect it with firebug, ty.
[14:36:30] <Aple> Find all occurences of overflow:hidden; with firebug and remove them one by one until you find the culprit
[14:36:35] <Aple> np
[14:36:54] <lazarus477> Aple: trying that now and first :-)
[14:38:20] <swiggy> how can i tell the file extention of a input type="file" ???
[14:38:46] <swiggy> i tried $('#fileinput').live('change',function() { });
[14:38:48] <Anyvie> get the input value, split ('.') and take the last
[14:38:51] <swiggy> but doesnt fire
[14:39:44] <swiggy> nvm
[14:39:46] <swiggy> had wrong element id
[14:39:49] <swiggy> durp durp
[14:40:36] <ch3mical> derp
[14:40:53] <swiggy> whats an easy way of getting the extention of the value/file? using split('.') would work -- but what if the file contains multiple .'s (ie: this.is.a.valid.file.txt)
[14:41:21] <ch3mical> swiggy: .split('.').pop()
[14:41:25] <swiggy> i guess always use the last one..
[14:41:25] <swiggy> yeah
[14:42:53] <Aple> djQuery: Not going the validation plugin route this time. Done helping me?
[14:45:04] <lazarus477> Aple: Yep, found it.
[14:45:24] <swiggy> how do i automatically focus on a input=file?
[14:45:31] <swiggy> i tried $(this).focus()
[14:45:33] <lazarus477> Aple: I wish they would document this issue on the module page, haha.
[14:45:36] <swiggy> but doesnt open up the file browser
[14:45:39] <lazarus477> Aple: Thanks, life saver.
[14:46:30] <swiggy> $('#file').live('change',function(){   var $this = $(this);    var ext = $this.val().split('.').pop();     if (ext != 'pdf'){ $this.focus(); } });
[14:46:33] <swiggy> doesnt work =\
[14:48:45] <Aple> lazarus477: np, anytime you run into something like that, just get rid of overflow hidden, if that screws up your page, put a .clear div below the content within that div to fix it
[14:48:53] <Aple> djQuery++
[14:48:56] <lazarus477> Aple: I simply added to my theme custom css:  superfish-block { overflow: visible; }  The problem was in the styling of the superfish blocks.
[14:49:24] <lazarus477> Aple: ty
[14:49:35] <Aple> Yeah, got that, this is #css though, but if you run into that problem again, and changing overflow to vis or getting rid of it screws up your page, check out clearfix.
[14:49:42] <Aple> It'll save you a lot of layout problems in the future.
[14:49:52] <lazarus477> yup
[14:52:31] <lazarus477> Aple: Are you familiar with the superfish menu? I am trying to get it to list menu items in columns rather than rows.
[14:53:12] <ZorseRider> Can  you pass dynamically generated content into a jquery command (such as a tooltip)?
[14:55:48] <Aple> djQuery: ... it was == instead of != for the val
[14:56:17] <Aple> I was testing if it enter was hit, and if the field was not empty. Therefore, when the field was empty and enter was hit, it was processing it.
[14:56:19] <Aple> fml...
[14:56:31] <lazarus477> How do I enable MegaMenus in superfish as in the example: http://mehrpadin.net/demo/superfish/node/6
[15:01:05] <ZorseRider> Can you pass a php array (for dynamic generated/toggled wordpress content) into Jquery for further stylization?
[15:04:08] <knapper_tech> when doing an html(' foo'), do the tags inside foo become active?  html tags.  anchor in particular
[15:05:16] <ajpiano> ZorseRider: you can, but it's better to like, inject data into the dom and then pass that to a tooltip or someting dynamically
[15:05:37] <ajpiano> knapper_tech: <a> tags in that situation should just work fast
[15:05:38] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: How would ou do that? (inject tdata into the DOM)?
[15:05:55] <ajpiano> ZorseRider: if you have like some content in WP, you would like, store it in a data attribute
[15:06:05] <ajpiano> or the title attribute
[15:06:59] <ajpiano> knapper_tech: work just fine*
[15:07:07] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: http://codepad.org/YAqTLjXY here is the current array code I want to pass to a cluetip/tooltip/simpletip
[15:07:47] <knapper_tech> ajpiano:   I'm trying to insert part of a document that happens to have a link.   ie $('#foo').html('lorum ipsum <a href="www./.com">epson saltsum</a>');
[15:08:06] <ajpiano> knapper_tech: bonus points for epsom saltsum
[15:08:31] <knapper_tech> hey, can't help it if it aint funny
[15:08:44] <knapper_tech> irc ppl need <3 2
[15:08:45] <ajpiano> ZorseRider: is there any way you can like, pass this data so you can render it from your template that produces the page?
[15:08:57] <ajpiano> i haven't really done much with wp
[15:09:31] <knapper_tech> shoudl i use a live() or something?
[15:09:37] <ajpiano> no
[15:09:46] <knapper_tech> it should work out of the box, no?
[15:09:50] <ajpiano> a normal href should work just fine, it's native behaviour
[15:09:55] <knapper_tech> the html.. yeah
[15:10:05] <knapper_tech> maybe i got a bug i'm just not seeing
[15:10:06] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: That Im not sure.  The array has 2 parts to it.... the "Option 1" title (which is toggled on or off depending on a checkbox controlled in backend) and the description showing up in div tags.  The second part would be contained in the cluetip, and the first part would need to be generated as  link.
[15:10:59] <ajpiano> ZorseRider: you should just be pushing all the information into the DOM when you render the page with wordpress
[15:11:12] <ajpiano> for the time being put the tooltip content inside of a <span>
[15:11:25] <ajpiano> then down the line you should be able to easily use any tooltip to fetch that information and render it in the tooltip
[15:11:35] <ajpiano> or at worst, then move it into an attribute from the <span>
[15:11:44] <dragonkh> anyone good with jquery and want to earn some cash ?
[15:11:55] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: okay. replace the <div> with <span>.  Got that. But how to make the words "option 1" clickable for the cluetip link?
[15:12:35] <ajpiano> make them into anchors? or bind some click handler into them with jquery?
[15:13:54] <ajpiano> knapper_tech: if you make a demo that shows it actually not working i can take a look
[15:17:20] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: something like this for passing it to DOM? http://jsfiddle.net/3xvgd/2/
[15:17:57] <ajpiano> huh
[15:18:19] <ajpiano> i'm confused
[15:18:54] <ajpiano> the span thing was an off hand recommendation, not something you have to do at all
[15:19:22] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: Right. Im just looking up code that might help me pass the original php code I have (with if conditional) into DOM so that Jquery can then pick it up
[15:19:22] <ajpiano> i'm not really sure what you're trying to do at all
[15:20:28] <ajpiano> jquery can get it from any html structure
[15:20:33] <knapper_tech> i had a bug.  nothing more.
[15:20:35] <ajpiano> just create one that actually makes sense
[15:21:16] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: Does my original array with if statement "not make sense" ?
[15:21:36] <ajpiano> showing me php is pointless
[15:21:37] <ZorseRider> Someone originally said that maybe jquery could pass it with something like delegate or live
[15:21:44] <ajpiano> all i care about is rendered html
[15:22:13] <ajpiano> ZorseRider: if you want to use cluetip, go look at cluetips
[15:22:22] <ajpiano> cluetip's demos, see what type of HTML they have
[15:22:34] <ajpiano> and generate something similar in your php/wordpress/backend whatnot
[15:23:39] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: For elaboration, with the current php, each option outputs as: http://codepad.org/vguWx7TQ
[15:24:17] <fabiobik> hi guys
[15:24:22] <ajpiano> and what part is the tooltip, the div ?
[15:24:42] <fabiobik> how to submit a form when radiobutton selected
[15:25:27] <ajpiano> good lord cluetip has an awful api
[15:26:52] <lazarus477> Ok I think I figured out the superfish megamenu.
[15:26:58] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: Yeah.  The div content would be what the tooltip reads when the first part of the array (the text: "Option 1", "Option 2", etc..) is clicked on
[15:27:38] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: Yeah.  I also found simpletip.  Not sure how much better its API is: http://craigsworks.com/projects/simpletip/
[15:28:09] <ajpiano> it's better
[15:28:53] <ajpiano> i could make a demo using this 1sec
[15:30:14] <ajpiano> ZorseRider: this html is really odd
[15:30:18] <ajpiano> why would you mark it up like this
[15:30:32] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: point out the specific code you are questioning about, please.
[15:30:54] <ajpiano> http://codepad.org/vguWx7TQ
[15:31:03] <Blutterbob> Quick: base64 is encoding o encryption?
[15:31:28] <ajpiano> encoding
[15:31:52] <fabiobik> how to submit a form when radiobutton selected
[15:31:53] <Blutterbob> As I knew, just had to be sudfe.. o my god..
[15:32:30] <ajpiano> ZorseRider: you should try to implement qTip, it is the successor to simpletip
[15:32:38] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: Oh, that. Im not married to it.  When getting the if/then statement to work, I just used those as quick ways to see if things were working as needed.
[15:32:51] <ajpiano> ok
[15:33:13] <ZorseRider> ajpiano: the only thing that needs to be right is the words "Option 1" , "Option 2".  But the description text doesnt have to be in divs.
[15:38:41] <eukreign> is there something similar to mochaui in jquery?
[15:38:55] <ajpiano> ZorseRider: check out these qtip demos
[15:38:56] <ajpiano> http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/content/default
[15:39:02] <ajpiano> you should see how it works and atempt to implement it
[15:39:24] <ajpiano> just put your code in like <p title="Option 1 Description">Option 1</p>
[15:39:34] <ajpiano> that makes it really easy to have a tooltip just drpo in place on top of us
[15:39:38] <ajpiano> unforatunely i have to get moving here
[15:39:46] <ZorseRider> alright. Thanks so much
[15:39:48] <colin3440> why is this line returning the error "unterminated string literal
[15:40:00] <colin3440> why is this line returning the error "unterminated string literal"? $("li#yourprojects").after("<li id='"+data.id+"'><div class='font1'>"+title+"<span class='font-desc'> ( <span class='font-desc-link' onclick=\"editProject("+data.id+")\">edit</span> | <span class='font-desc-link' onclick=\"delProject(<?=$p['id']?>)\">delete</span> )</span></div><div class='font-desc'>"+desc+"</div></li>");
[15:40:10] <colin3440> I should have put that in pastebin..
[15:40:23] <ajpiano> good lord
[15:40:32] <ajpiano> you should not be generating elements that have onclick attributes in the html
[15:41:21] <colin3440> ajpiano: but that's not causing the problem. is it?
[15:41:41] <ajpiano> unterminated string literal means exactly what it says
[15:41:43] <Distraught> can someone help me with a slow load situation?
[15:41:46] <ajpiano> you have a string literal that is unclosed
[15:41:57] <ajpiano> you must have some quote mismatch somewhere in there
[15:41:57] <wookiehangover> var string = "ok
[15:42:45] <Distraught> when i get into a single article the page takes 14-16 seconds to start load the article
[15:42:53] <Distraught> i wonder if there are any errors
[15:42:54] <Distraught> :S
[15:43:04] <colin3440> unterminated string literal can mean a few different things... apparently (though this isn't related to my problem) it can be caused by code like this: var foo = "</script>";
[15:44:14] <rhizmoe> someone should invent a word for the opposite of "degradable"
[15:45:08] <colin3440> upgradable?
[15:45:52] <ajpiano> colin3440:  i bet that if you actually cleaned that up and bound events in jquery instead of that ghastly sight, your string issues would probably go away
[15:46:18] <ajpiano> cause then you wouldn't be dealing with this whole nonsense of escaping strings and passing things you know about in memory back into the dom as hardcoded argument strings and oy it pains me to speak of
[15:46:45] <solidus-river> how do you insert into an unordered list?
[15:47:26] <ajpiano> $("<li>Foo</li>").appendTo("#someUL");
[15:47:56] <colin3440> what makes that so ghastly? would you like me to add hard returns? nothing is escaped and it's mostly just html. do you have trouble looking at html?
[15:48:02] <_pr0t0type_> Hey guys,
[15:48:27] <solidus-river> ajpiano: the person who wrote this was somehow doing $('<ul/>'), objectToAdd
[15:48:31] <_pr0t0type_> what does attaching a dot and something else mean in bind functions?
[15:48:41] <_pr0t0type_> like bind('click.something', functin()...)
[15:48:49] <ajpiano> solidus-river: that is a valid syntax as well
[15:48:59] <ajpiano> _pr0t0type_ event "namespace"
[15:49:20] <_pr0t0type_> where do you define the "something" namespace before use?
[15:49:26] <_pr0t0type_> as a function or closure?
[15:49:27] <ajpiano> you don't
[15:49:29] <solidus-river> ajpiano: how does that syntax work, what i wrote is not syntax :( i accidently deleted thier code, thsi is the last type of thing i dont know how to search for on jQuery Api i think
[15:49:48] <_pr0t0type_> I'm confused
[15:50:02] <_pr0t0type_> whats a usecase where thats useful?
[15:50:22] <thebignoise> Hi. Im using a trigger to force change, that works but it doesnt call the the change function for the element i just called trigger on, any suggestions>
[15:51:03] <ajpiano> solidus-river: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2 As of jQuery 1.4, the second argument can accept a map consisting of a superset of the properties that can be passed to the .attr() method. Furthermore, any event type can be passed in, and the following jQuery methods can be called: val, css, html, text, data, width, height, or offset. etc
[15:51:18] <ajpiano> _pr0t0type_, if you're building a plugin or any other thing where you only want to keep track of the events that you yourself have bound to the event
[15:51:25] <ajpiano> and then perhaps unbind all the events you bound
[15:51:31] <ajpiano> .unbind(".myplugin")
[15:51:45] <_pr0t0type_> i see
[15:56:08] <solidus-river> ajpiano: so... umm..... $('<ul/>', {name: whatever, :
[15:56:24] <ajpiano> to the extent that one would put a name attribute on a ul, yes :)
[15:56:43] <solidus-river> god this is the worst feeling ever
[15:56:51] <ajpiano> is it?
[15:56:55] <solidus-river> i've inherited the shittiest shittiest code i've ever seen in a lnaguage i'm not familiar with
[15:56:58] <solidus-river> this guy before me was horrible
[15:57:00] <solidus-river> and they want me to fix it
[15:57:21] <solidus-river> i cant make heads or tails of his crap, its easier to rewrite
[15:57:26] <solidus-river> >_<
[15:57:29] <ajpiano> is physical violence an option?
[15:57:35] <solidus-river> ajpiano: i wish
[15:57:49] <solidus-river> ajpiano: i'm considering asking them to arrange a meeting between me and him so i can ask him wtf he was thinking
[15:58:21] <thebignoise> is there a way to decipher the difference between a triggered change with .trigger and user change?
[15:59:11] <ajpiano> that would probably make sense
[15:59:23] <ajpiano> thebignoise, you can pass some data along with the event when you trigger it
[15:59:33] <ajpiano> so that you can see if that data is there and whether you triggered it
[16:15:09] <thebignoise> is there a way to check all the children of a div for an element with a certain class?
[16:16:51] <solidus-river> is there an easy helper function to filter a <ul> based on a search string?
[16:17:45] <servicomdq> hi , some body who speak spanish?
[16:21:23] <servicomdq> hi, i need to ask about jquery problem... how work this?
[16:23:58] <xid> is there a ready() that fires after all ajax requests have occured?
[16:28:46] <servicomdq> hiii , id owrking this sseeetttt
[16:29:05] <djQuery> thebignoise: $('#mydiv').find('input').find(':checkbox').prop('checked', true);
[16:29:35] <thebignoise> djQuery: Thank you for the response. I used another method tho.
[16:29:59] <djQuery> thebignoise: and what was that?

[16:54:06] <phyntek> Hi guys, i want to create a div to grow the width onmouseover event, but when the div grow, and i move the mouse inside the div, the div size go crazy

[16:54:19] <phyntek> any help will be appreciate
[16:55:29] <eric_> dabear: will that always work? aren't there ways of input text that don't trigger keydown?
[16:56:24] <dabear> there are, but I have found no other solution except a settimeout poll to check if the contents have changed
[16:57:21] <eric_> dabear: ah ok, thanks, keydown is probably good enough for now

[17:45:34] <lazarus477> I got am stuck on a snag with a view that outputs panel fields: dev.pizzeriatorino.se
[17:46:02] <lazarus477> If anyone familiar with the box model and CSS cares to take a look it would be helpful.
[17:46:56] <lazarus477> Problem: I have two fields Title and Body being outputed to the same region of the panel the view places the fields in: Colorerd Purple and Lime for clarity.
[17:47:24] <lazarus477> I am trying to get the Body to display inline with the Title.
[17:47:55] <lazarus477> Anyone familiar with the box model, CSS and layout issues that has firebug handy should be able to help.
[17:50:52] <lazarus477> Guess what, I just fixed it :-)
[17:55:23] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, i use ubuntu -= but what kind of message do you get in ie?
[17:55:40] <ch3mical> No message, it just doesn't close the list
[17:55:58] <ch3mical> It works, but the autocomplete list stays open for some stupid reason
[17:56:22] <ch3mical> Also, get install vbox or wine or something :P
[17:56:27] <ch3mical> -get
[17:56:39] <geekbuntu> wine is bad news
[17:56:45] <geekbuntu> except the kind you drink
[17:56:48] <Aple> Anyone want to show me how to test if this val is empty after being trimmed? Er, how to add $.trim to this. Not sure of the syntax...
[17:56:48] <ch3mical> I think I might be a little used to apt-get install (get install) lol
[17:56:48] <Aple> if ( $(this).closest('.question').find('input').val() != '' ) {
[17:56:52] <geekbuntu> you think it could be keyup?
[17:57:36] <ch3mical> geekbuntu: There's nothing bound to keyup in the demo I made, but in the working copy that trigger is necessary for other things going on
[17:58:17] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, ie 9?
[17:58:22] <geekbuntu> (or any/all of them)?
[17:58:23] <ch3mical> Yeah
[17:58:32] <ch3mical> I haven't looked at older versions
[17:58:37] <ch3mical> Don't care so much
[17:58:45] <geekbuntu> i see bugs for ie9 @jq 1.5 and up
[17:58:51] <geekbuntu> for change and keyup
[17:59:05] <ch3mical> weak
[17:59:09] <geekbuntu> for giggles try 1.4
[17:59:11] <Aple> How do I add $.trim to this line?   if ( $(this).closest('.question').find('input').val() != '' ) {
[17:59:24] <ch3mical> I mean, the keyup does bind and trigger properly, if that tells you anything
[17:59:37] <ch3mical> Unless the bug is that it's not chaining properly
[17:59:45] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, let me see how this bug is reported
[17:59:51] <geekbuntu> maybe it is like ur problem
[18:00:53] <ch3mical> I took keyup out and it still has the same issue
[18:01:34] <geekbuntu> swap it with .change()
[18:01:39] <geekbuntu> see if it makes a difference
[18:01:57] <geekbuntu> i don't know the jq source code so well, but it says it uses 'event.which' with keyup
[18:02:05] <geekbuntu> which returns NaN in ie
[18:02:33] <djQuery> geekbuntu: see ?ui.menu
[18:02:34] <bot-t> geekbuntu, UI/API/1.9/Menu - Transform a simple list with a few links into a themable menu widget. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Menu
[18:02:42] <djQuery> geekbuntu: see ?ui.autocomplete
[18:02:43] <bot-t> geekbuntu, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[18:02:59] <geekbuntu> djQuery, yea - was thinking about autocomplete for my issue
[18:03:02] <geekbuntu> it's so clean
[18:03:10] <geekbuntu> unless you use keyup + ie9 o.0
[18:03:16] * geekbuntu just ask ch3mical 
[18:03:26] <ch3mical> Keyup isn't the problem
[18:03:41] <ch3mical> I took that out and it's still not closing the list when you select an item
[18:04:26] <ch3mical> Oddly enough, the keyup trigger by itself works in IE, as a side note
[18:04:53] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, ok - i logged into a win7 box with ie9
[18:04:58] <geekbuntu> the dropdown does not work at all
[18:05:04] <Aple> nm, .trim() chains
[18:05:30] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, version 9.0.8112.16421
[18:05:32] <ch3mical> geekbuntu: try refreshing, for some reason it took a couple refreshes before it would work in jsfiddle
[18:05:39] <geekbuntu> man that's not cool
[18:05:47] <geekbuntu> ppl should revolt on ie
[18:05:54] <ch3mical> srsly
[18:06:09] <ch3mical> I hate supporting it
[18:06:29] <geekbuntu> omg ie has dev tools
[18:06:31] <geekbuntu> xD
[18:06:36] <ch3mical> Yeah, finally
[18:06:39] <geekbuntu> that's like a firetruck having a flame thrower
[18:06:46] <ch3mical> They're not great though
[18:07:00] <ch3mical> Passable, I guess
[18:07:43] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, ok, after 5 refreshes...o.0 ->i can type 'f' use my mouse and select flah123 and the list goes away
[18:08:20] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, if i use down arrow i can go to the choice also
[18:08:28] <geekbuntu> it will not tab autocomplete
[18:08:39] <ch3mical> You sure it went away or just obscured by the text?
[18:08:43] <ch3mical> It's hard to see
[18:08:44] <geekbuntu> the dropdown needs a background/hard to read the text
[18:08:54] <geekbuntu> yes, it went away
[18:09:01] <geekbuntu> if your neck depends on it i'll record it
[18:09:10] <geekbuntu> i'm not using compatibility view either
[18:09:22] <ch3mical> 1 sec
[18:11:14] <ch3mical> I'm on the exact same version
[18:11:18] <ch3mical> 16421
[18:11:39] <ch3mical> Plus I'm not the one who discovered the bug, so it's not just me
[18:11:40] <geekbuntu> i do not have compatibility view on (button in the url window)
[18:11:47] <ch3mical> Nor I
[18:11:51] <geekbuntu> this is a pure install - no plugins
[18:11:55] <ch3mical> Same
[18:11:58] <geekbuntu> because it never gets used
[18:11:59] <geekbuntu> :-D
[18:12:01] <ch3mical> Same
[18:12:02] <ch3mical> lol

[18:15:46] <coldhead> .each(function (i, whatever) // i is the iteration
[18:16:06] <coldhead> it's in da-docs, da-beginner

[18:18:43] <ch3mical> MarcGuay_: because it's IE7
[18:18:46] <ch3mical> I win!
[18:19:51] <MarcGuay_> ch3mical: So true.  So many tears.
[18:20:12] <MarcGuay_> I'm glad none of my clients give a shit about 6 anymore.
[18:20:29] <MarcGuay_> But now they want CSS3 effects in a browser that doesn't support them.

[18:35:00] <jahc> I've got two divs with an id, one is div_one one is div_two .. how to get all the textbox values from div_two ?
[18:35:24] <jahc> I wont bother pasting my code, its so not working I cant even call it code.
[18:37:56] <clayton> Can anyone help me with a jquery/ajax caching issue i am having in IE only
[18:38:39] <coldhead> i hope so :(
[18:38:57] <da-beginner> what's the syntax to append array in jquery?
[18:39:00] <clayton> I have an ajax call to grab some data and populate my div
[18:39:14] <clayton> the first time around it populates the div no problems
[18:39:26] <clayton> however if i fire the ajax call again, it seems like its using  the cached content.
[18:39:45] <clayton> I have the cache set to false in the ajax/jquery side
[18:40:07] <clayton> i checked the response coming back and confirm the data is correct but it doesn't reflect on the page
[18:40:27] <coldhead> ?p @ clayton
[18:40:27] <bot-t> clayton, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:40:42] <gf3> da-beginner: wat
[18:41:11] <da-beginner> gf3: i want to add additional item into the array
[18:41:22] <gf3> da-beginner: which array?
[18:41:38] <clayton> http://jsfiddle.net/wDXjy/
[18:41:50] <clayton> coldhead > http://jsfiddle.net/wDXjy/
[18:41:58] <clayton> thats my ajax call
[18:42:00] <da-beginner> gf3: i've got a simple array ["a","b","c"]
[18:42:07] <da-beginner> i want to add "d" on it
[18:42:30] <gf3> ?eval var a = [1,2,3]; a.push( 4 ); a
[18:42:31] <bot-t> gf3: [1, 2, 3, 4]
[18:42:35] <gf3> da-beginner^
[18:43:00] <miketaylr> awww pushhhhh it.
[18:43:52] <clayton> http://jsfiddle.net/wDXjy/ @ coldhead
[18:44:15] <coldhead> yes bro, i saw it the first 2 times you linked it >: |
[18:44:26] <clayton> lol sorry
[18:44:50] <coldhead> clayton: http://jsfiddle.net/wDXjy/1/
[18:45:02] <coldhead> i would try something like that to see if anything can be made to change
[18:45:11] <coldhead> your code looks okay otherwise
[18:45:23] <coldhead> and cache false should do what you want
[18:45:38] <clayton> ok, its weird because im using fiddler as my console and it says its got the correct information
[18:45:44] <coldhead> you might need to paste more, the problem might be elsewhere
[18:46:02] <coldhead> understood
[18:46:07] <clayton> it works the first time around, however second time around it doesn't populate..it works ok in all other browsers
[18:46:21] <clayton> ill try your suggestion
[18:46:24] <clayton> thanks appreciate it
[18:46:31] <coldhead> the new content doesn't contain something with the ID autoshipwrapper?
[18:46:39] <coldhead> or invalid html?
[18:47:07] <clayton> no
[18:47:42] <coldhead> and the server logs are showing new requests everytime with unique timestamps?
[18:47:52] <coldhead> for IE?
[18:49:06] <da-beginner> gf3: thanks :)
[18:50:28] <jahc> wil this run on text and textarea input boxes?
[18:50:29] <jahc>     $('#div_test :text,textarea').each(function () {
[18:50:29] <jahc>         alert('text or textarea ' + this.id + ' ' + this.value);
[18:50:29] <jahc>     });
[18:50:41] <jahc> It works on every div on the page if I omit the #div_test part
[18:50:55] <jahc> but I only want the div_test controls
[18:52:56] <clayton> coldhead: yes correct
[18:53:10] <clayton> im getting unique timestamps, the data that is returned is even correct..
[18:53:22] <clayton> however it seems as if its not repopulating the div with the new response
[18:53:46] <coldhead> the way you are doing that is really not controversial
[18:54:19] <coldhead> so the version that appends the random number, you're not seeing the number change?
[18:55:25] <clayton> no
[18:55:28] <clayton> the number remains the same
[18:55:58] <coldhead> so success isn't firing?
[18:56:09] <coldhead> i would try these kinds of things http://jsfiddle.net/wDXjy/4/
[18:57:32] <clayton> when i do alert, the data is correct
[18:57:35] <clayton> everytime..
[18:57:42] <clayton> it is the correct data i expect to see change in the div..
[18:57:44] <coldhead> so it IS firing the success
[18:57:48] <clayton> yes
[18:57:51] <coldhead> motherfucker
[18:57:56] <clayton> lol right!
[18:57:58] <clayton> stupid thing
[18:58:15] <coldhead> try something other than html
[18:58:19] <coldhead> use append() instead
[18:58:22] <clayton> ok
[18:58:36] <coldhead> or text()
[18:58:47] <clayton> ill try append
[18:59:35] <gnarf> jahc: $("#div_test input[type='text'], #div_test textarea") ?
[18:59:43] <jahc> I'll try it, ta
[18:59:47] <gnarf> or $("#div_test").find(":text, textarea")
[19:00:12] <clayton> haha append works, but isn't ideal as it keeps adding on
[19:00:42] <clayton> append returns the correct information everytime..
[19:00:52] <coldhead> try .html('').append(data)
[19:01:06] <coldhead> and then get the hell awway from this code, it's cursed
[19:01:12] <gf3> use a closure
[19:01:13] <gf3> then
[19:01:18] <gf3> ajax
[19:01:33] <jahc> $("#div_test").find(":text, textarea").each(function () {
[19:01:33] <jahc>         alert('text or textarea ' + this.id + ' ' + this.value);
[19:01:33] <jahc>     });
[19:01:33] <jahc> ?
[19:01:47] <jahc> or should I var objs =  $("#div_test").find(":text, textarea"); ?
[19:01:49] <coldhead> ?alert
[19:01:50] <bot-t> Forget alertuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browsers built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[19:01:54] <gf3> not enough closures or ajax
[19:01:55] <clayton> coldhead: that worked....clearing then appending
[19:02:04] <clayton> there has to be an answer
[19:02:10] <coldhead> clayton: gross, let's never speak of this again
[19:02:17] <clayton> lol deal
[19:02:24] <gf3> CLOSURE AJAX
[19:02:25] <clayton> thanks for your help
[19:02:57] <coldhead> it wasn't help, it was a crude workaround
[19:03:01] <coldhead> so we could get on with our lives
[19:03:11] <clayton> lol
[19:03:12] <clayton> yeah true
[19:03:23] <coldhead> it's not usually like this
[19:03:34] <coldhead> i swear
[19:03:54] <clayton> lol yeah i couldn't understand WTF....oh well..no for next time..
[19:04:16] <gf3> CLOSE( AJAX )
[19:05:11] <coldhead> isn't clojax the new ajax javascript lisp language?
[19:06:44] <datarecall> http://paste2.org/p/1544261 i am trying to figure out why the delays are not kicking in i need a pause between the fadein and fadeouts
[19:06:47] <jahc> maybe I should ask this in HTML, but what are the rules with divs? can you put one inside a table?
[19:08:41] <coldhead> sure you can, jahc
[19:08:42] <coldhead> go wild
[19:08:52] <coldhead> the only limit is yourself
[19:10:14] <coldhead> datarecall: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/simple-pulse-plugin-for-jquery/
[19:10:21] <coldhead> makes your code much more readable
[19:10:50] <datarecall> well all i want to do is bring in the loading div then hide the loading div bring in another div but 3000 delay between them all
[19:12:45] <coldhead> datarecall: http://paste2.org/p/1544277
[19:12:51] <coldhead> i would try something more like that
[19:13:06] <coldhead> use the callbacks instead of delay()s
[19:13:16] <datarecall> i think i got it with queue
[19:13:22] <coldhead> FINE
[19:13:26] <coldhead> SORRY I TRIED TO HELP
[19:13:30] <datarecall> cause that means it will take 3000 mili to fade in
[19:13:35] <coldhead> I'LL JUST GO HARM MYSELF
[19:13:38] <datarecall> lol
[19:13:42] <datarecall> thanks though
[19:13:59] <coldhead> NO REALLY, DON'T MENTION IT
[19:14:11] <coldhead> SORRY I WASTED YOUR PRECIOUS PRECIOUS TIME
[19:15:28] <coldhead> bye forever, clayton

[19:44:21] <Assimilater> well he's virtually in the room, but is he available right now? :P
[19:45:42] <coldhead> his deadlines are not your problem
[19:45:46] <coldhead> oh wait
[19:45:52] <coldhead> YOUR deadlines are not HIS problem
[19:45:57] <Assimilater> i know
[19:46:05] <Assimilater> i don't expect anything
[19:48:09] <Edler> hey guys
[19:48:12] <Edler> where can i find UX experts ?
[19:48:19] <coldhead> #css
[19:48:25] <Edler> thx
[20:09:17] <da-beginner> how do i make a dynamic selector? eg. i would like to select #group_x   with x can be anything from 1 to 100
[20:11:06] <Aple> Hey guys, where is my syntax messed up? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/447209/ Trying to replace val of an input IF it's not empty already.
[20:11:21] <Aple> It's telling me the statement is the screwed up part: $(this).val() = '';
[20:11:33] <Aple> "invalid assignment left-hand side"
[20:17:30] <da-beginner> how do i do selector using regex?
[20:17:58] <Edler> da-beginner: what do you need to select
[20:17:58] <Edler> ?
[20:18:19] <Edler> da-beginner: $("[id=^group_]")
[20:18:20] <coldhead> da-beginner: you can't use regexs in selectors
[20:18:20] <Edler> ?
[20:18:28] <da-beginner> i need to select anything that matches <div id="group_x_element">
[20:18:41] <da-beginner> with x can be any number (1, 203, etc)
[20:18:57] <kurol> sounds like you need a class :D
[20:21:04] <coldhead> $('[id^=group_][id$=_element]') -- won't force x to be a digit
[20:21:11] <coldhead> but close
[20:21:13] <coldhead> and slow as hell
[20:21:23] <coldhead> sounds like you need some class
[20:21:30] <coldhead> ?hi5 kurol
[20:21:31] <bot-t>  kurol
[20:25:04] <da-beginner> coldhead: how do i make sure it is a number?
[20:25:13] <coldhead> ?filter
[20:25:13] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[20:25:46] <coldhead> provide a function to filter that will only accept elements where the ID matches your regex
[20:26:00] <coldhead> you CAN use regexs in there, just not in selectors
[20:26:07] <coldhead> sounds like you need a class though
[20:27:23] <datarecall> coldhead i have a form i want to submit on page load whats the best way
[20:27:29] <datarecall> tried .submit()
[20:27:41] <coldhead> submit is the best way
[20:27:49] <datarecall> hmm it doesnt seem to be working
[20:27:55] <coldhead> ur doon it wrung
[20:28:02] <datarecall> lol prolly
[20:28:47] <coldhead> if you paste it here someone will look and fix it
[20:28:58] <coldhead> because #jQuery loves to fix your failures
[20:29:16] <datarecall> http://paste2.org/p/1544409
[20:29:56] <mechanicaljerk> I want to addClass/removeClass in an infinite loop, is this a bad idea?
[20:30:08] <datarecall> sounds like it
[20:30:10] <mechanicaljerk> is there a graceful way of doing that? or am I just totally thinking about it all wrong?
[20:30:31] <mechanicaljerk> I want to 'animate' the cells of a table by changing their classes dynamically, and I'd like it to loop endlessly
[20:30:51] <mechanicaljerk> but I'm thinking there may be a performance hit over time :/
[20:31:01] <Nitrxgen> use setInterval
[20:31:38] * mechanicaljerk googles
[20:31:38] <mechanicaljerk> thanks!
[20:32:08] <datarecall> ahh k i got it i was using the id of the button not the form
[20:32:10] <Nitrxgen> setInterval(function() { .. }, 1000); execute the callback every 1 second (1000 milliseconds)
[20:32:40] <Nitrxgen> using something like while or for will have fuck up the performance because there's no wait
[20:33:09] <mechanicaljerk> Nitrxgen: you rock man
[20:33:53] <coldhead> ?g setinterval harmful zetafleet @ mechanicaljerk
[20:33:54] <bot-t> mechanicaljerk, Why I consider setInterval to be harmful | Blog | Zetafleet | Web ... - http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[20:34:03] <coldhead> there's a sensible alternative there :)
[20:34:30] <mechanicaljerk> coldhead: oh, that's nice too
[20:36:52] <mbf> Quick Question: How can I correctly target a single image from a long line of images? And then using animate to change the padding on JUST the image currently hovered over? I know the code to animate, how do I target a single image?
[20:37:12] <ale_> Hello
[20:37:36] <coldhead> mbf: give it an ID is the fastest way
[20:37:46] <coldhead> mbf: otherwise see ?eq
[20:37:47] <bot-t> mbf, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[20:38:01] <coldhead> if you know you want the 7th picture, for example
[20:38:02] <datarecall> i want to see if a class exists on a page and then run an if else what would be the best way
[20:38:03] <mbf> A seperate id for each image?
[20:38:14] <ale_> How can I call an action, let's say I have $("#reload").live("click", function(){ .... } and another $("#reload2").live("click", function(){ blablabla }.. How can I call inside the #reload function the #reload2 function?
[20:38:19] <coldhead> mbf: yes, because $('#some_id') is fast fast fast!
[20:38:44] <coldhead> $('img:nth(3)') finds the 4th image but it's slower
[20:39:07] <mbf> That lengthens the script , by a lot right?
[20:39:22] <mbf> Or can I use commas?
[20:39:29] <mbf> or something
[20:39:32] <coldhead> um, i don't know what you mean
[20:39:36] <coldhead> sure you can use commas!
[20:39:37] <coldhead> ?tias
[20:39:38] <bot-t> Try It And See
[20:40:11] <mechanicaljerk> how would I add a delay between addClass and removeClass? $('#foo').removeClass('bar').delay(500); doesn't seem to do the trick
[20:40:28] <mbf> $('#share-icons1, #share-icons2, #share-icons3 ').hover(function() { //mouse in           Is this correct?
[20:40:48] <coldhead> mechanicaljerk: hold up, i'll show you
[20:40:55] <mechanicaljerk> coldhead: thanks
[20:41:57] <mbf> yes or no?
[20:42:11] <gf3> ?tias @ mbf
[20:42:12] <bot-t> mbf, Try It And See

[20:44:08] <mechanicaljerk> that's exactly what I'm after
[20:44:11] <coldhead> a pleasure!
[20:44:18] <ale_> how can I call an event inside another event?
[20:44:26] <coldhead> i like that pattern, it's tight
[20:44:39] <coldhead> the only flaw is having to repeat the duration
[20:44:45] <coldhead> which violates DRY
[20:44:54] <coldhead> but BITE ME

[21:37:04] <coldhead> now: coffee
[21:37:19] <dr0id> get some for me too!
[21:38:05] <coldhead> i'm sorry dr0id, the factory has closed
[21:38:35] <dr0id> ohh
[21:38:42] <dr0id> tommorrow then
[21:38:51] <da-beginner> how do i get a correct syntax for sth like this: $('[id=box_error]')[0] ?
[21:39:17] <dr0id> $('div[id="box_error"]')[0]
[21:39:27] <dr0id> or $('#box_error')
[21:40:53] <da-beginner> dr0id: but i cant perform .each function on the item anymore
[21:41:01] <da-beginner> as it is now an array and not an object
[21:41:15] <dr0id> you can have only 1 element with box_error id anyway
[21:43:18] <da-beginner> dr0id: hypothetically if that happens, then how do i go about approaching it?
[21:43:42] <versatiletech> da-beginner: like dr0id $('#box_error')[0]. It's loads much faster than anything else.
[21:44:05] <dr0id> you just fix your html then :P by validating it in the w3c validator
[21:44:15] <da-beginner> versatiletech: the problem is that as soon as i use [0] it becomes an array and i cannot do .each function anymore
[21:44:58] <versatiletech> da-beginner: when you use the square brackets, it's to get the vanilla DOM object
[21:45:44] <versatiletech> if you want to use each you can't rely on an ID, because IDs should be unique. No other HTML element should have the same ID.
[21:47:48] <da-beginner> ok.. next question: you have :first and :last selector.. is there nth selector? (not child)
[21:48:08] <da-beginner> oh there is!
[21:49:28] <versatiletech> ?nth-child @ da-beginner
[21:49:29] <bot-t> da-beginner, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[21:49:39] <ronino> hi
[21:50:15] <ronino> i want to select all checkboxes which are not disabled, but what am I doing wrong here? $('input[type="checkbox"][disabled!="disabled"]')
[21:50:53] <Cork> ?:not @ ronino
[21:50:53] <bot-t> ronino, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[21:51:10] <versatiletech> ?eq @ da-beginner
[21:51:11] <bot-t> da-beginner, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[21:51:35] <Cork> ronino: so $('input[type="checkbox"]:not([disabled="disabled"])')
[21:52:36] <Cork> ronino: or you could simply use :disabled
[21:53:45] <versatiletech> ?docs
[21:53:48] <bot-t> versatiletech, Main Page - There are a number of alternative resources for browsing the API. http://docs.jquery.com/
[21:54:16] <ronino> Cork: hmm, with :not() it still selects all checkboxes
[21:54:21] <ronino> Cork: cache is cleared
[21:54:32] <Cork> ronino: wierd
[21:54:53] <Cork> ronino: try $('input[type="checkbox"]:not([disabled])')
[21:55:07] <Cork> or as i said just :disabled
[21:55:30] <ronino> Cork: not([disabled]) works!
[21:56:07] <Cork> ronino: so the value disabled is never added to the attribute
[21:56:19] <Cork> ronino: some js scripts just create an empty attribute
[21:56:19] <ronino> Cork: input[type="checkbox"]:not(:disabled) works also
[21:56:43] <Cork> ronino: those should more or less be the same things
[21:57:04] <ronino> Cork: yep
[22:07:40] <sasori> need help, can someone show me a sample, how to use the error param in jquery $.ajax ?
[22:08:45] <coldhead> did you look at the one on the jquery docs, sasori ?
[22:09:31] <sasori> coldhead: yeah i did..but no example http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax#options :(
[22:10:42] <coldhead> touche
[22:12:25] <coldhead> sasori: http://jsfiddle.net/wL3GZ/1/
[22:12:28] <coldhead> that any help?
[22:13:12] <aaairc> has anyone run into an issue with .load() not working quite right in Safari? I'm loading a bunch of images to my page, and the .load on each image works great in FF and Chrome, but with safari it seems to throw the image on the page to early or something... as the container  in which the images are added... doesn't adjust its height correctly as the images are loaded.
[22:13:28] <sasori> coldhead: yeah it eases the pain..thanks :)
[22:13:52] <coldhead> sasori: http://jsfiddle.net/wL3GZ/2/
[22:14:49] <coldhead> aaairc: load is tricky, caching and latency and things
[22:14:55] <coldhead> it's better to try to avoid it
[22:17:12] <aaairc> coldhead: any suggestions on what to use? for my page, i have like 100 images that are going to be loaded... some with a bigger file size than others... and I want them to be inserted into the page only once they are fully loaded, with a known height and width
[22:18:04] <coldhead> it sounds like you want load, huh
[22:18:34] <coldhead> the problem i've had with load is when it doesn't fire
[22:18:41] <aaairc> when i say known height and width... the height and widths of the images are going to be variable... so i need the image to be fully loaded so that i can place the image correctly on the page based on its dimensions
[22:18:57] <coldhead> yes i understand bro
[22:19:13] <coldhead> there's some other property you can use to detect if an image is loaded
[22:19:31] <aaairc> coldhead: kk
[22:19:34] <aaairc> coldhead: yeah?
[22:19:38] <coldhead> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_img_complete.asp
[22:19:43] <coldhead> LOL w3schools
[22:19:50] <coldhead> that's the thing anyway
[22:20:01] <coldhead> you can set up something to load and test for that
[22:20:09] <coldhead> and show them when the load is complete
[22:20:15] <coldhead> it's not very jQuery but it works
[22:21:11] <aaairc> coldhead: so i would test for imageObject.complete... and if it still isn't i set a timer or something and check again in like 100 milliseconds?
[22:22:20] <coldhead> yes exactly
[22:22:23] <coldhead> bindo
[22:22:37] <aaairc> coldhead: ok cool, i try that
[22:22:46] <coldhead> good luck!
[22:25:39] <aaairc> coldhead: thanks
[22:37:03] <plunkin> is it common to use PUT and DELETE in 'real world' RESTful APIs? or do people typically modify the concept to include only GET and POST? the information I'm finding seems to be dated
[22:38:36] <coldhead> it's not much used in practice
[22:38:57] <coldhead> not all browsers support PUT and DELETE
[22:39:52] <plunkin> thank you
[22:41:55] <dr0id> coldhead: does any browser support them ?
[22:42:06] <dr0id> I don't think chrome, ff, opera, safari, ie do. all others are not used
[22:42:18] <cjheath> I'm doing an async AJAX request, but when the server is down (COnnection refused) I get the success callback called immediately
[22:42:28] <coldhead> i think all browsers don;'t support them*
[22:42:28] <cjheath> How can I detect whether there was an error?
[22:43:12] <dr0id> coldhead: :P
[22:43:32] <dr0id> plunkin: PUT and DELETE are implemented via POST
[22:43:46] <tdignan> cjheath: .error callback?
[22:43:56] <cjheath> The success CB gets called
[22:44:05] <cjheath> I've stepped through the jquery code
[22:44:10] <tdignan> so? did you try to also catch the error callback?
[22:44:12] <cjheath> gets readystatechange immediately
[22:44:17] <cjheath> yes
[22:44:18] <cjheath> I did
[22:44:21] <tdignan> and it didn't get thrown?
[22:44:22] <cjheath> errorCB was not called
[22:44:27] <tdignan> This is happening on a timeout?
[22:44:30] <cjheath> no
[22:44:34] <tdignan> What is causing it?
[22:44:34] <cjheath> immediately
[22:44:40] <cjheath> asynchronously, of course
[22:44:43] <tdignan> an error on your server?
[22:44:55] <cjheath> I've stopped the server to test the client behaviour
[22:45:02] <plunkin> dr0id, thanks for bringing that up.  I noticed something to that effect in my research.  I'll look into it more
[22:45:07] <cjheath> np-one is listeening s I said, itr gets CONNREFUSED
[22:45:11] <tdignan> so the server is turned off, and the success callback is being called?
[22:45:16] <cjheath> exactly
[22:45:20] <tdignan> I would call that a bug, personally.
[22:45:32] <cjheath> I believe it's the defined behaviour
[22:45:37] <tdignan> odd
[22:45:39] <cjheath> but rather bad behaviour all the same
[22:45:46] <cjheath> I want to know how I can detect it
[22:45:57] <cjheath> because this is a long-poll
[22:46:06] <cjheath> and the cient goes beserk reconnecting
[22:46:14] <tdignan> can you check the data, cjheath?
[22:46:25] <tdignan> maybe just check if it's null, or something
[22:46:26] <cjheath> what data?
[22:46:32] <cjheath> Oh, yeah, maybe
[22:46:55] <cjheath> but really, if it's null because the server sent nonthong, then I really want to reconnect straight away anyhpw
[22:47:43] <cjheath> except that's the wrong thing to do if it's a conn fail
[22:47:52] <tdignan> you could setTimeout if null and request again
[22:48:07] <tdignan> it's not totally wrong...
[22:48:38] <cjheath> I can measure the time taken to get no data back too
[22:48:54] <cjheath> but how long is long enough? I guess my long poll will always return soemthig
[22:49:15] <cjheath> but still, it could take a while to fail to connect, if there's a network failure
[22:49:31] <chubz> so i was going to www,jquery.com but i mistyped www,jqueery.com
[22:49:35] <cjheath> like, as long as the long-poll timeout was going to be
[22:49:50] <chubz> i lol'd quite hard
[22:49:59] <cjheath> typo-squatting
[22:50:27] <cjheath> haha
[22:50:31] <phrearch> hi
[22:50:50] <cjheath> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238559
[22:51:00] <cjheath> "XMLHttpRequest needs a way to report networking errors"
[22:52:04] <cjheath> looks like it's just not possible.... who designes these fucked-up APIs and what kind of school-children are they anyhow?
[23:03:02] * coldhead np: Animal Collective - ODDSAC
[23:06:13] <chubz> i know this sounds like a dumb question. but why is jquery better than ext js, yui, sproutcore,gwt, etc? personally i do feel like jquery is better because of the better community, simple coding, easy to learn, etc etc. but some people i know aren't convinced that jquery is the top js framework. what kind of quantifiable data can i use as proof against the other frameworks?
[23:06:33] <dr0id> jQuery > *
[23:06:37] <coldhead> people who aren't convinced are morons
[23:06:48] <chubz> currently i'm trying to benchmark some frameworks with certain ui functions and seeing which framework handles them well.
[23:06:55] <coldhead> the proof is write less do more
[23:07:14] <dr0id> another proof is coldhead codes jQuery
[23:07:36] <coldhead> can you really benchmark a thing like that?
[23:07:45] <chubz> exactly
[23:07:46] <coldhead> the best bet is to suck it and see
[23:07:46] <dr0id> no way, so jQUery is a clear win
[23:08:16] <dr0id> also #jquery is the 6th most populated channel on freenode
[23:08:19] <chubz> i'm trying to debate whether its worth going through each function, making them perform tasks(like creating x amount of grids)
[23:08:35] <coldhead> you can easily spend a few weeks with ext and conclude "hmm, this is great for making something windowsy in my browser, but oh shit i have to finish this client site tonight, better crack out jQuery"
[23:08:48] <dr0id> hehehehe
[23:08:50] <coldhead> also yes, what you say, the community and testing and support
[23:09:05] <coldhead> but overall jQuery is more fun and productive for most people
[23:09:10] <dr0id> jquery is a clear win bro, I don't care abt people saying it's the php4 of JS
[23:09:14] <coldhead> and if you don't feel that way we can't be friends
[23:09:20] <dr0id> Righto
[23:09:26] <dr0id> ?friends
[23:09:27] <chubz> exactly, that is EXACTLY what i think right now. but the people i'm working with don't think so
[23:09:27] <coldhead> here is a graph of us not being friends
[23:09:29] <bot-t> dr0id, Twitter Friends Widget | jQuery Plugins - There is a Facebook fans widget, Google friends widget, what about a Twitter friends widget?! Here is a jQuery plugin that you can embed anywhere to display pictures of your Twitter followers or fr... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/twitter-friends-widget
[23:09:49] <coldhead> and later we can maybe benchmark us not being friends
[23:09:52] <dr0id> chubz: that's because they have got ego issues
[23:09:56] <chubz> i need to come up with quantifiable data
[23:10:01] <coldhead> the peopel youre walking with are morons
[23:10:07] <coldhead> its not quantifiable
[23:10:17] <chubz> so... :P
[23:10:17] <coldhead> that's like quantifying which christianity is right for you
[23:10:20] <chubz> LOL well its my job right now
[23:10:21] <coldhead> or which woman
[23:10:40] <coldhead> go for the number of tests in jQuery's test suite vs other livs
[23:10:42] <coldhead> libs*
[23:10:46] <chubz> and in order to switch over to jquery from ext js
[23:10:51] <coldhead> and how many sites it's used on
[23:11:15] <coldhead> but if your shop is already using ext, good luck :\
[23:11:21] <coldhead> none so blind as them won't see
[23:11:49] <dr0id> lol, you use extjs in a "shop" ?
[23:11:51] <chubz> hmmm
[23:11:54] <dr0id> what shop ? coffee shop ?
[23:12:05] <dr0id> if so, then send me some coffee
[23:12:46] <dr0id> .seen chubz
[23:12:46] <hsbot> chubz was seen 55 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: hmmm
[23:14:12] <coldhead> chubz: maybe compare the number of nights per capita that devs cry themselves to sleep in #jQuery vs #extjs ?
[23:14:48] <dr0id> Lul, they just got 85 peeps
[23:14:48] <coldhead> or maybe read everything rmurphey's written about moving from jQuery to Dojo just for perspective and balance
[23:14:59] <chubz24469> sorry i was disconnected from the chat.
[23:15:13] <coldhead> oh no
[23:15:14] <chubz24469> i think someone else has my name too
[23:15:19] <coldhead> my precious wisdom has gone to waste
[23:15:24] <Cork> coldhead: i would say the numbers quite a bit higher in extjs
[23:15:25] <chubz24469> so as i was saying
[23:15:27] <dr0id> haha
[23:15:37] <Cork> coldhead: that framework is... scary
[23:16:32] <chubz24469> yeah exactly, when i joined in on the project, i checked out our product running on ext js and i kind of barfed a little bit.
[23:17:14] <chubz24469> and since the people that designed it are like die hard ext js users, they wont take my word, or anyone elses word that jquerys better until QUANTIFIABLE proof is given. and i think thats just ridiculous
[23:18:07] <coldhead> it can't be done, chubz24469
[23:18:20] <Cork> chubz24469: its components library is much bigger then jquery-ui's, and that i would say is its only plus
[23:18:23] <coldhead> that's like asking for quantifiable proof that blondes are more attractive
[23:18:30] <coldhead> its a matter of taste
[23:18:37] <coldhead> you should work somewhere else
[23:18:37] <Cork> chubz24469: sadly jquery-ui is developing a bit too slow
[23:18:42] <coldhead> quickleft is hiring
[23:18:57] <dr0id> what about quickright and slowleft ?
[23:19:21] <coldhead> those are for you to start, dr0id
[23:19:29] <dr0id> Hahaha
[23:19:58] <dr0id> chubz24469: http://quickleft.catchthebest.com/apply/d5df
[23:22:05] <coldhead> life is too short to argue with extjs users
[23:22:12] <coldhead> we should pity them
[23:22:13] <chubz24469> haha maybe i should apply
[23:22:31] <chubz24469> HAHA funny.
[23:23:32] <da-beginner> quickleft: "we will arrange travel and accommodations for your interview" -- including overseas travel? :)
[23:24:32] <chubz24469> coldhead, what makes you so confident in jquery? are you fluent in other js languages as well?
[23:25:12] <dr0id> he's the best
[23:25:18] <coldhead> i have used others, yes
[23:25:23] <coldhead> but i keep coming back
[23:25:26] <dr0id> He helped make extjs back in 2004
[23:25:36] <sasori> question: what's wrong with my code? http://jsfiddle.net/dUwJW/ whenver i do jQuery('#id').val() via firefox console, it always return the "male" value even if i selected female
[23:26:31] <coldhead> the smartest and funniest web guys are using jQuery, in my experience
[23:26:50] <coldhead> that's enough for me :D
[23:27:06] <dr0id> smartest - dr0id, funniest - coldhead
[23:27:19] <coldhead> works for me!
[23:27:35] <coldhead> sasori: you can't have duplicate IDs
[23:27:38] <coldhead> they must be unique
[23:28:09] <sasori> ok
[23:28:50] <coldhead> sasori: http://jsfiddle.net/dUwJW/1/
[23:31:38] <sasori> coldhead: ok, but how to get the value of any of thow 2 radio buttons in preparation for ajax ?... is it $(':radio').val() ?  or there's something  else ?
[23:32:06] <coldhead> :radio looks good!
[23:32:10] <coldhead> i'd try that
[23:34:32] <sasori> but still if i do this jQuery(':radio').val() , from the console of firefox, it squirts out male even if female is ticked, how come your example from the fiddle does outputs the correcct value even if it has the same id ?

[23:53:04] <coldhead> you really gotta unduplicate your IDs
[23:54:25] <sasori> ok, actually that gender thing is just part of a form, i only pasted the gender part coz that's the only problem where i can't get the value..if am gonna use "input", won't that mess up the other forminput when getting their values ?
