[00:10:00] <zeroquake> hello , if convert some html strings to a jquery object  by using $(somehtml) , does it put it into DOM?
[00:10:09] <zeroquake> if i dont append it to body yet
[00:10:14] <Cork> no
[00:10:21] <Cork> it parses it into a dom fragment
[00:10:55] <zeroquake> so , this way , is it like technically faster to do DOM manipulation stuff
[00:11:08] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[00:11:21] <zeroquake> so i have a bunch of html basically lists
[00:11:33] <zeroquake> say i convert the whole thing into jquery object
[00:11:35] <Cork> but yes it is faster to modify a dom element that isn't attached to the document as it doesn't cause reflow until you attach it again
[00:11:39] <zeroquake> i can use jquery methods on it
[00:11:48] <Cork> you don't convert you parse
[00:11:56] <zeroquake> i need to append a span element before every list item
[00:12:15] <zeroquake> i think i can even attach event handlers to everything
[00:12:19] <Cork> you can either parse the html and then clone the dom element and attach it
[00:12:23] <Cork> or parse the html every time
[00:12:30] <Cork> both works about the same speed
[00:13:05] <zeroquake> i can just append the jquery object to body element right?
[00:13:16] <Cork> eh
[00:13:29] <zeroquake> let me try it out in jsfiddle
[00:13:39] <Cork> you can append a dom element with jquery yes
[00:13:55] <Cork> but if you mean docuemnt.body.appendChild(jqObject) then no
[00:14:52] <zeroquake> but this works $(body).append( $( "h2" ) )
[00:15:23] <Cork> sure
[00:15:34] <Cork> but that will move all h2 elements to the end of body
[00:15:50] <zeroquake> yes
[00:21:46] <zeroquake> http://jsfiddle.net/ux1qamog/
[00:22:13] <zeroquake> the list is only put into DOM at the end .
[00:22:47] <Cork> ya?
[00:23:23] <zeroquake> other way is put the list into DOM first , get the selector for each folder class , insert the div
[00:23:38] <Cork> what you're doing is a better solution
[00:24:09] <zeroquake> i am trying to understand why it is better , is it only because there will be no reflow or paint
[00:24:18] <Cork> yes
[00:24:21] <zeroquake> i thought even accessing DOM is expensive
[00:24:29] <Cork> reflow is the most expensive thing you can do in a browser
[00:24:55] <Cork> dom access is fairly fast as long as it doesn't cause reflow
[00:25:33] <zeroquake> imagine a list with like 10000 nodes inititally , would DOM access matter with such number?
[00:26:08] <Cork> having such a big dom affects it
[00:26:25] <zeroquake> the reason i ask is the application i am working will reach so many nodes in less than a year
[00:26:26] <Cork> dom gets slower the bigger it gets, and the more event listener you bind
[00:27:01] <Cork> though that doesn't include unattached dom elements
[00:27:41] <zeroquake> right , soo building the whole html and adding event listeners etc to it and then appending to body in one go , is probably the best way
[00:28:01] <Cork> zeroquake: no not really
[00:28:01] <zeroquake> thank you very much :) appreciate the help.
[00:28:04] <Omar-> good morning!
[00:28:10] <Cork> if you can avoid add duplicate event handlers
[00:28:23] <Cork> and delegate them to a common parent if you have multiple elements that would use the same code
[00:28:43] <Cork> that way you would reduce the number of event handlers and speed up the dom tree
[00:29:11] <Cork> if you add the event handler before or after it is appended doesn't matter
[00:29:32] <zeroquake> any particular reason why ?
[00:30:09] <Cork> i just gave you the reason
[00:30:10] <zeroquake> i have always been told , searching for dom elements is expensive.
[00:30:29] <Cork> that can be true
[00:30:43] <Cork> but depends much more on what selector you use and how big the dom is
[00:30:47] <Cork> then if you do it or not
[00:31:26] <nick___> ok
[00:32:15] <zeroquake> what i am trying to understand is selector search performance say for like 10000 nodes | (JQuery Obj not in DOM yet) VS DOM
[00:32:53] <Cork> the speed of the selector depends on how many elements needs to be searched through and the query it self
[00:33:23] <zeroquake> but in this it is same structure , same number of elements , same query
[00:33:52] <zeroquake> the only difference is one is already in DOM  , other is just a jquery object not in DOM
[00:34:14] <Cork> query speed doesn't depend on if it is in the main tree or not
[00:34:18] <Cork> only from where you search
[00:46:37] <zeroquake> am suprised , http://jsperf.com/jquery-object-vs-jquery-object-in-dom
[00:49:16] <Erwat> zeroquake: what
[00:49:20] <Erwat> how does that even make sense
[00:49:48] <zeroquake> all of tests or just the last 2 ?
[00:49:58] <Erwat> i only saw the last jsperf link
[00:49:59] <Cork> you're testing pears and apples though
[00:50:54] <Cork> remove the append and prepend code AND parse the html in the precode
[00:50:59] <Erwat> Cork: did you know that you can compare apples and oranges?
[00:51:00] <Cork> then you have a comparable test
[00:51:40] <Erwat> why is chrome 40 so much slower than 39 at it though?
[00:52:22] <Cork> most like cause it has ran on different computers with different cpus
[00:52:34] <Cork> you can't really use those stats for anything
[00:52:44] <Erwat> okay this isn't the first time i've heard of this
[00:52:51] <Erwat> why do they do that on jsperf?
[00:52:57] <Cork> flashy?
[00:53:24] <Erwat> i mean i can forgive like chrome vs safari that the machines will be abit different but not like chrome vs chrome
[00:53:31] <Cork> i normally don't even load the browserscore code
[00:54:00] <Cork> Erwat: so chrome on a p4 should run at the same speed as chrome on an i7 haswell?
[00:54:14] <Cork> :)
[00:54:17] <Erwat> no, chrome 40 and chrome 39 should both be tested on the same machine
[00:54:23] <Erwat> not on different ones
[00:54:24] <Cork> well sure
[00:54:38] <Cork> the browser speed is from visitors
[00:54:50] <Erwat> Cork: is javascript the script version of java? you know like vbscript is to visual basic!
[00:54:52] <Cork> and sure if a visitor runs multiple versions on the same machine they do show up there
[00:55:12] <Cork> Erwat: no, javascript was called javascript for marketing back in the 90's
[00:55:20] <Erwat> and is coffeescript the script version of coffee? what about typescript and type?
[00:55:22] <Cork> it has NOTHING to do with java except for that
[00:55:25] <zeroquake> updated them  , not much difference.
[00:55:42] <Erwat> someone should make a chocolatescript
[00:55:55] <zeroquake> lol...that would be cool
[00:56:07] <Cork> zeroquake: you need to cache the selector
[00:56:18] <Cork> and i get a BIG difference here
[00:56:46] <Cork> zeroquake: var $already = $("#already");
[00:56:47] <zeroquake> cache ? can you give me the link?
[00:57:21] <Cork> the two last one has close to nothing to do with the test though
[00:57:36] <Cork> one tests the parsers speed and one the speed of an id selector
[00:58:07] <Cork> and id selectors is the fastest selector there is
[00:58:33] <zeroquake> hmm , there is no option to delete the test case
[00:58:40] <zeroquake> changed them to find a class
[00:58:57] <Cork> i don't see the point of having them there at all
[00:59:40] <zeroquake> wonder what a empty test case returns
[00:59:59] <zeroquake> lol...300 million ops/sec
[01:00:45] <Erwat> that's pretty impressive
[01:00:52] <zeroquake> but coming back , it is 100% difference b/w two
[01:03:03] <Cork> looks about the same to me http://jsperf.com/jquery-object-vs-jquery-object-in-dom/2
[01:03:18] <Cork> 0.5% is in the margin of error
[01:04:27] <Erwat> Cork: may i ask you a grunt related question but it's really about json?
[01:05:25] <zeroquake> yes , oh i see you cached the selector
[01:07:31] <zeroquake> anyone interested in a quick code review of about 200 lines :P
[01:10:20] <Erwat> zeroquake: i'm getting almost 1.7 billion on an empty test!
[01:10:51] <zeroquake> woa...i guess it is because of setup and teardown
[01:24:24] <Eels> plakplek.be/test/backlog.html - http://plakplek.be/test/scripts/menuHighlight.js - and I'm using a plugin for the :in-viewport selector. Any idea why it's not highlighting the menu item that's in the viewport?
[01:41:22] <gtristan> To fetch a css value on a node I can do: var value = $(node).css ('overflow-y') <-- yes ?
[01:41:39] <Cork> yes
[01:42:18] <gtristan> thanks
[01:47:00] <gtristan> is there no horizontal variation of .scrollTop() ?
[01:47:12] <gtristan> ah
[01:47:17] <gtristan> scrollLeft
[01:47:20] <gtristan> of course
[01:50:32] <Eels> Argh, not even 10 lines of code, yet I can't find it.
[01:58:21] <gtristan> When an element has overflow-y set to 'scroll', how does one find the height of the visible area ?
[01:58:36] <Eels> element.height() ?
[01:58:47] <gtristan> I suspect that $(element).height() reports the full height of the thing, no ?
[01:58:53] <Cork> no
[01:59:00] <ash_m> can you make svg's with jquery or does it have to be normal Javascript?
[01:59:02] <gtristan> oh that throws everything off
[01:59:05] <Cork> thats clientHeigbt
[01:59:10] <gtristan> ah
[01:59:10] <Cork> *Height
[01:59:15] <ash_m> because i know you have to use createElementNS instead of createElement
[01:59:18] <Cork> or height() + scrollHeight
[01:59:37] <Cork> ash_m: you don't have to use NS
[01:59:45] <Cork> you just have to make it from a svg document
[01:59:48] <gtristan> Cork, so .height() for the visible height, and .clientHeight() for the real element height (including invisible space), thanks
[02:00:23] <ash_m> Cork: what do you mean?
[02:00:36] <ash_m> Cork: rather, how would I go about doing that?
[02:00:41] <Cork> ash_m: svgDoc.createElement should work just fine
[02:00:51] <ash_m> is svgDoc a variable?
[02:01:05] <Cork> it would be what points to the svg document
[02:01:22] <ash_m> Cork: but, I have to define svgDoc, right?
[02:01:27] <Cork> similarly to how document normally points to a html pages dom
[02:01:27] <gtristan> ah so clientHeight() is a native DOM api
[02:01:40] <Cork> gtristan: it isn't a function
[02:01:59] <gtristan> ah right
[02:02:15] <Eels> $('ul#menu li a[href*=sectionId]') is valid syntax, right?
[02:02:15] <ash_m> Cork: I don't get it...
[02:02:42] <Cork> Eels: yes, but always quote your attribute values
[02:02:56] <Cork> $('ul#menu li a[href*="sectionId"]')
[02:03:07] <Eels> Even if it's a variable?
[02:03:14] <Cork> it isn't
[02:03:25] <Cork> $('ul#menu li a[href*="' + sectionId + '"]')
[02:03:32] <ash_m> Eels: if it really is a variable: $('ul#menu li a[href*="' + sectionId + '"]')
[02:03:44] <Eels> Gotcha, thanks.
[02:03:50] <ash_m> Cork: you beat me to it :P
[02:04:59] <ash_m> Cork: so, I still don't understand... :(
[02:06:27] <ash_m> Cork: is this something about along the lines of what we're talking about?
[02:06:29] <ash_m> SVGDocument =  event.target.ownerDocument;
[02:07:01] <Cork> if target is an element on the svg document ya
[02:08:34] <ash_m> because I don't get that even more... I have only ever seen 'event' used with grabbing whatever triggered a funciton
[02:08:50] <ash_m> my stupid window won't scroll down with additional messages, it's terribly annoying
[02:10:03] <Eels> Good, one step closer. Now how do I 'refresh' it? I feel like thee should be a removeClass() in there somewhere http://pastie.org/9827103
[02:10:31] <Cork> ash_m: if you run inline svg you can't get events from inside svg
[02:10:43] <Cork> svg is an external document even if the svg tag is inline
[02:10:48] <Cork> so events don't bubble
[02:11:21] <ash_m> Cork: well, I am trying to create an svg using JS so there's nothing on the page to reference as far as I know... right?
[02:12:04] <Cork> Eels: just do $('.inViewport').removeClass('.inViewport') before the if
[02:12:16] <Cork> ash_m: ah, right
[02:12:33] <Cork> ash_m: i would strongly recommend looking into raphael
[02:12:43] <Cork> ?g raphaÎl
[02:12:44] <b-ot> Cork: Rapha√´l‚ÄîJavaScript Library ‚Üí http://raphaeljs.com/
[02:14:22] <Cork> zeroquake: btw http://jsperf.com/faq#remove-snippet
[02:15:05] <zeroquake> @cork , thank you.
[02:18:49] <ash_m> Cork: is this possible with jQuery? http://jsfiddle.net/3n36wavo/
[02:19:17] <Cork> ash_m: it is possible but tricky
[02:19:50] <ash_m> Cork: I see
[02:19:56] <ash_m> Cork: thanks :)
[02:31:53] <Eels> http://plakplek.be/test/scripts/menuHighlight.js It just highlights the first tab and stays on that :/
[02:38:22] <Mark_2> will anyone help me installing a jquery slide panel on my webpage? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today
[02:39:34] <ash_m> Cork: why doesn't .append work on the first 2 divs?
[02:39:41] <ash_m> http://jsfiddle.net/ng7gz0y8/2/
[02:41:06] <gtristan> is there a way I can get the mouse position relative to a div - regardless if some of the upper part of the div is hidden because of a parent's overflow-y: scroll ?
[02:41:45] <gtristan> what I'm currently doing is: yOffset = event.pageY - $(node).offset().top
[02:41:49] <gtristan> and same for X
[02:42:18] <Omar-> ash_m maybe you need to clone it
[02:42:20] <gtristan> but I have a sneaking suspicion that $(node).offset () wont tell me the real offset
[02:42:28] <gtristan> i.e. even if it's a negative one
[02:43:00] <Omar-> ash_m http://jsfiddle.net/ng7gz0y8/3/
[02:43:01] <gtristan> if it would, it would make no sense anymore to subtract it from pageY
[02:43:54] <ash_m> Omar-: that's awesome... why do we need to clone it?
[02:44:49] <Omar-> ash_m because .append(svg) detaches "svg" and then inserts into target div
[02:45:04] <ash_m> I see
[02:45:09] <Omar-> it moves it, it doesn't clone it
[02:46:27] <ash_m> so, if I was going to create the .tile's via a for loop, I should define svg and all that outside and just use .clone() inside the loop?
[02:48:44] <Omar-> ash_m yes
[02:48:52] <ash_m> Omar-: thanks!
[02:49:07] <Omar-> or you can create fresh elements insde the loop
[02:49:13] <Omar-> you're welcome :)
[03:04:19] <Cork> ash_m: it does
[03:04:27] <Cork> first it adds the svg element to the first element
[03:04:32] <Cork> then it moves it to the second element
[03:04:38] <Cork> then it moves it to the third element
[03:04:41] <Cork> and there is where it is now
[03:04:47] <ash_m> Cork: thanks :)
[03:05:06] <Cork> append doesn't clone elements
[03:07:51] <Eels> JS vars are global, right?
[03:08:49] <slax0r> if defined in global scope
[03:10:17] <Cork> Eels: undeclared variables in legacy mode is globals yes
[03:10:53] <Cork> in strict mode you get an error if you store valutes in an undeclared variable
[03:11:17] <Cork> (and ya strict mode is GOOD)
[03:13:35] <gtristan> Ok I've reduced the problem, getting the relative mouse position works by subtracting the scrollTop()... now what I need to know is the relative position of an element in it's parent
[03:13:58] <gtristan> calling $(element).position() returns negative values for nodes which are in the hidden part of the scrollable area
[03:14:22] <gtristan> might I hazard a guess there is a DOM property 'clientPosition' ?
[03:14:36] <Cork> gtristan: you most likely need the offset to the offsetParent not the closest parent
[03:15:20] <Cork> gtristan: and the position is clienX/Y
[03:15:29] <Cork> ?g mdn clientX
[03:15:30] <b-ot> Cork: MouseEvent.clientX - Web API Interfaces | MDN ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent.clientX
[03:16:09] <gtristan> oh that might make things easier indeed for the first part
[03:17:32] <gtristan> Cork, I don't quite understand your answer that I 'need the offset to the offsetParent not the closest parent', though :-/
[03:17:42] <gtristan> what is 'the offsetParent' ?
[03:18:02] <Cork> gtristan: offset is created by an element with offset: set in the css
[03:18:30] <Cork> offset to an element that isn't causing a position offset isn't normally useful
[03:18:50] <gtristan> ah, so that's 'a thing'... I'm getting confused with that and the return of $(element).offset() (which I've been using)
[03:19:20] <gtristan> In this case, what I really need is the y position of an element, relative to it's parent, nothing more
[03:19:52] <gtristan> of course, that must include any area which happens to be hidden
[03:20:20] <Cork> gtristan: not sure what you mean
[03:20:54] <Cork> opps
[03:21:01] <Cork> offest: css property >_<''
[03:21:10] <Cork> position: css property *maan*
[03:21:13] <Eels> Any idea why the menu automatically closes immediately after I open it? http://pastie.org/9827229
[03:21:19] <gtristan> Like say I have a vertical list of <div>s inside a parent <div>... I need to know the position of a child <div> in it's parent
[03:21:28] * gtristan checks MDN for the position property
[03:21:38] <gtristan> so the DOM tree sets these CSS properties by itself ?
[03:21:46] * gtristan thought CSS was input only
[03:22:10] <Cork> O_o'
[03:22:16] <Cork> input as in <input>??
[03:22:26] <Cork> gtristan: and no it doesn't
[03:22:27] <gtristan> as in... you set it... the browser consumes it
[03:22:38] <Cork> if you want an element to be an offset parent you have to give it position
[03:22:51] <gtristan> no ok, that's not what I'm looking for, yeah I know about relative and absolute... not in depth but know it exists
[03:23:00] <Cork> but yes the browser has style computedStyle
[03:23:16] <Cork> the later is access to what the browser calculates
[03:23:59] <Cork> gtristan: anyway http://jsfiddle.net/c1r1aca7/
[03:24:12] <gtristan> so... you are saying basically...: if I want to know the actual X/Y position of the left/top of an element /within/ it's direct parent... I need to configure some CSS properties ?
[03:24:25] <Eels> This is so weird, with h1 it works fine, but with body it seems to register a click that's not there
[03:24:57] <Cork> gtristan: you most likely want to set the reference element as position: relative; yes
[03:25:10] <Cork> just cause it means the browser will keep this data for you
[03:25:16] <Cork> you could calculate it manually
[03:25:22] <Cork> but it can be quite a bit of work
[03:25:33] <gtristan> strange :-/
[03:25:44] <Cork> what's strange?
[03:26:03] <gtristan> so the browser doesnt 'just know' where a child will be placed relative to it's parent ?
[03:26:10] <gtristan> regardless of how you set up the CSS ?
[03:26:19] <Cork> it doesn't expose it
[03:26:20] <gtristan> that is... strange... I mean 'it' did the reflow
[03:26:22] <Cork> it does know
[03:26:37] <gtristan> ok... but it hides this, I'm not allowed to know... inconvenient :-/
[03:27:07] <Cork> basically the difference is e.offset().top vs e.position().top - e.parent().position().top
[03:27:12] <Cork> for the most simple cases
[03:27:21] <Cork> but if you have text flow it can be trickier
[03:27:41] <gtristan> so a work around to this would be to have knowledge of the scrollable div in question, and add $(scroll).scrollTop() to $(element).position().top
[03:34:17] <gtristan> that works nicely indeed
[03:37:18] <gtristan> .on ('dragover', function (e) { offsetY = e.pageX - $(parentScroll).scrollTop () - $(dropZone).offset (); }) - and then check offsetY against $(dropZoneChild).position ().top + $(parentScroll).scrollTop()
[03:37:33] <gtristan> yeah it's messy, I'm removing it on one end just to add it back on the other
[03:38:12] <gtristan> Incase you're curious, this is a sort of port of http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/voidberg/html5sortable/blob/master/examples/examples.html
[03:38:42] <gtristan> which does not handle sorting in scrollable areas, and does not handle the parent area itself as a dropzone
[03:39:10] <gtristan> so it has some problems which I'm massaging out of my own codebase (which is written much differently than that one is)
[03:52:35] <Cork> ya d&d is messed up
[03:52:54] <Cork> you need to cancel a bunch of even handlers for it to work half decent
[03:54:31] <gtristan> yes, it's a nightmare
[03:54:54] <gtristan> especially if you include the 'selectstart' & this.dragDrop() hack required for IE
[03:55:28] <gtristan> plus the dragleave events which occur on child elements - make sure your drop highlight placeholder has pointer-events: none
[04:09:45] <mocas> http://jsfiddle.net/ane5kncd/
[04:09:56] <mocas> whit the replaceWith are not working?
[04:10:02] <mocas> *why
[04:23:25] <Omar-> mocas what do you want to achieve?
[04:24:11] <Omar-> !api filter
[04:24:11] <b-ot> Omar-: .filter(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.  http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[04:25:06] <Cork> mocas:you want .find not .filter
[04:25:08] <mocas> Omar-: I would like to make a clone of a selector, and replace tags on that...

[04:26:05] <Erwat> at this point i think it would probably take less time to manually copy paste all the files together in th eproject
[04:26:24] <Erwat> in a manner that i want every single time a build has to be created than the time i've spent on actually trying to make this work and getting literally nowhere
[04:26:33] <mocas> the 2 works
[04:26:50] <mocas> Cork: I didn't know that I could do that....
[04:26:55] <mocas> it's nice :)
[04:26:59] <mocas> Thanks
[04:27:16] <Cork> mocas: .filter loops through the elements you have in the jquery element
[04:27:20] <Cork> in your case that is just a div
[04:27:29] <Cork> so filter("select") matches nothing
[04:27:35] <Cork> .find searches children
[04:27:40] <Cork> and that is what you want
[04:28:27] <mocas> I undurstand now.
[04:28:31] <mocas> Thank you.
[04:28:41] <Cork> uh
[04:28:52] <Cork> *loops through the elements you have in the jquery set
[04:28:56] <Cork> sorry for the typo
[04:39:15] <gtristan> any convenience API for the inverse of .scrollTop() ? (i.e. .scrollBottom()) ?
[04:56:21] <gtristan> So now that I know about clientHeight and such, there is still some 4 pixels that I cannot explain
[04:56:42] <gtristan> I've mocked up a fiddle which is close to what I am doing: http://jsfiddle.net/9edjpbxt/
[04:57:26] <gtristan> There is one of my use cases... i.e. when I programmatically add an item to the list, I want to auto-animate scroll to the bottom of the list where the item is visible
[04:58:19] <gtristan> Apparently I need to add '4' to the client height of the scrollable element's child in order for it to match up with the height of the scrollable element itself
[04:58:46] <gtristan> could this be a margin of the 'area' (in the fiddle example) ?
[04:59:12] <Omar-> could be margin/padding
[04:59:48] <gtristan> Inspecting the element in firefox shows no margin or padding on the 'area' element, though
[04:59:50] <R13ose> If I have two fadetoggle's how come one of them is fading in but the other is not showing up at all?  The site is http://ecosanity.org and the file is uv.js
[04:59:53] * gtristan just checked right now
[05:01:05] <gtristan> oh strange... I think it is infact the 2px margin on the *children* of the 'area' div
[05:01:21] <gtristan> now I know CSS is strange... but how could that possibly make sense ?
[05:03:51] <gtristan> it is indeed... so the margin seems to 'bleed out' of it's parent div's height
[05:04:10] <gtristan> thats unacceptable, the parent needs to be enlarged to make space for that margin :-/
[05:04:39] <ewz> I'm having an issue with datepicker... It seems like when I add a class to a day, it causes the calendar to reset. Does anyone know something about that?
[05:04:50] <Cork> gtristan: outerHeight() vs height()
[05:04:59] <Uhkis> http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif ;)
[05:05:18] <Cork> gtristan: css height is content + padding not including border or margin
[05:05:57] <gtristan> Cork, yes, good point, there is a difference... except what I need is the outer height of the node (right now it's .clientHeight)
[05:06:10] * gtristan presumes there is some native DOM property for that
[05:06:12] <R13ose> ewz: again?
[05:06:13] <Cork> !api outerHeight
[05:06:13] * gtristan searches
[05:06:13] <b-ot> Cork: .outerHeight(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. Returns an integer (without "px") representation of the value or null if called on an empty set of elements. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[05:06:41] <ewz> R13ose Still same issue sorta.
[05:07:05] <ewz> I've been working on this goddamn datepicker for almost 2 whole days now
[05:07:53] <R13ose> ewz: latest code?
[05:08:33] <ewz> doesn't do it in jsfiddle. Just wondering if there's any datepicker gurus here
[05:10:33] <R13ose> ewz: do you have anything else on the site, if so might be a problem with them or look at console errors.
[05:11:26] <ewz> Yeah, it's def something else on my site. just wondering what could cause a datepicker to reload unexpectedly
[05:11:29] <Omar-> Uhkis lol too true!
[05:11:53] <R13ose> ewz: there could be a million things and without seeing is had to know.
[05:12:05] <ewz> ya
[05:12:14] <ewz> wish i could replicate it
[05:14:11] <R13ose> Any thoughts on my question?
[05:19:32] <ewz> which one are you working on now?
[05:20:03] <ewz> also, just figured my shit out. it's ghetto rigged, but once i find the real problem later I'll go back and fix it
[05:20:24] <ewz> turns out there's a $(window).load event that runs after doc.ready
[05:23:04] <R13ose> ewz: look at my problem I said above.
[05:23:21] <ewz> I just got here. can't see it
[05:23:34] <ewz> wait nm
[05:23:48] <ewz> two fade toggles
[05:25:18] <ewz> I'm seeing a js error. That usually haults your js execution
[05:25:32] <ewz> Error: Permission denied to access property 'document'
[05:26:01] <ewz> that's a typically vague js error unfortunately, but my money is on that being your problem
[05:26:25] <R13ose> ewz: in which file?
[05:27:38] <R13ose> ewz: I see that now.
[05:27:47] <ewz> The error says it's triggered in some generic js file. But it's def in one of your files. I'd start in uv.js and delete the whole thing to see if it's there
[05:27:51] <R13ose> Yes I know
[05:27:53] <R13ose> I see
[05:27:55] <ewz> k
[05:30:06] <R13ose> ewz: thanks, I fixed that
[05:30:13] <ewz> Cool!

[05:39:35] <Cork> t4nk568: english please
[05:43:51] <islalobo> I'm trying to get a change function where if checkbox A is checked, then checkbox B cannot be checked. Not that it is disabled, but that if checkbox B is checked then checkbox A will become unchecked automatically and vice versa
[05:44:42] <Cork> islalobo: so you basically want a radiobutton? :D
[05:44:58] <xec> my thought exactly :)
[05:45:03] <islalobo> Cork, except that checkbox A is actually four checkboxes
[05:45:27] <Cork> i fail to parse that comment...
[05:45:31] <islalobo> But maybe? So I should say if any of checkbox A, B, C, D are checked then...
[05:45:44] <xec> islalobo: can you make a demo
[05:45:48] <Cork> again that sounds like a radio button
[05:46:03] <Omar-> one checked at a time = radio button
[05:46:22] <islalobo> checkbox A, B, C, D can all be checked
[05:46:36] <islalobo> Only E is the separate
[05:46:45] <Cork> ah
[05:46:52] <Omar-> then return false or unchecked on change
[05:46:54] <islalobo> so A, B, C, D are options you can choose one of four
[05:47:04] <Cork> ?paste @ islalobo
[05:47:05] <b-ot> islalobo: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:48:06] <axilla> morning all, i have an interesting bug with a .dialog window.  We pop up a dialog so that we can create new folders in our app.  When the modal is open if someone presses enter instead of clicking on create it logs them out of the app?
[05:48:37] <Cork> axilla: make sure the focus is inside the dialog
[05:48:50] <Cork> else enter will be triggering what ever has focus
[05:50:01] <islalobo> I'm having trouble coming up with the code
[05:50:06] <axilla> ahh, so just create an open function that sets focus to my create button, cork?
[05:50:09] <axilla> good idea. thanks!
[05:50:12] <axilla> that will probably solve it.
[05:50:40] <Cork> axilla: the modal: true  option should grab the focus by default
[05:50:49] <Cork> but it might fail for some reason
[05:50:50] <axilla> its not
[05:50:54] <axilla> i have modal true
[05:51:22] <axilla> probably we're passing the div HTML to the dialog via a var so that's probably why
[05:51:57] <islalobo> I guess I'm getting there http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/
[05:54:02] <Cork> islalobo: prop not attr
[05:54:47] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/2/ isaacdurazo
[05:54:53] <Omar-> islalobo ^^
[05:55:19] <Omar-> !api prop
[05:55:19] <b-ot> Omar-: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[05:56:32] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/3/
[05:57:07] <Cork> opps typo
[05:57:29] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/4/
[05:58:04] <Cork> axilla: also its kinda wasteful to use $(this).is(":checked") when all you need for the exact sane check is this.checked
[05:58:16] <islalobo> http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/5/
[05:58:41] <axilla> huh?
[05:58:52] <islalobo> I want something where the first four options one of four or all four can be checked; the last option and the first four are mutually exclusive
[05:58:54] <axilla> dont think that was mine mate :)
[05:59:00] <islalobo> That's mine...
[05:59:07] <Cork> opps sorry
[05:59:09] <Cork> islalobo: ^
[05:59:24] <islalobo> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/5/
[05:59:45] <Cork> that checkbox makes no sense...
[05:59:52] <Cork> why is it a checkbox?
[05:59:54] <islalobo> Well, that is why I'm asking for help
[06:00:03] <islalobo> How does it not make sense?
[06:00:03] <Cork> shouldn't it just be a button?
[06:00:27] <Uhkis> so many duplicate id's
[06:00:43] <Cork> and so few labels
[06:01:00] <islalobo> Cork no, the options are saved on submit http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/6/
[06:01:28] <islalobo> It's not an exact mock of what is on our site. I'm just trying to get an idea of what the proper js needs to be
[06:01:29] <Cork> so there is no option to unsubscripe a single "thing"?
[06:01:39] <islalobo> Sorry?
[06:01:49] <Cork> you have to unsubscribe all and then resubscribe the ones you want to subscribe?
[06:01:54] <islalobo> You can subscribe to one of four options or unsubscribe from all
[06:01:58] <islalobo> No
[06:02:14] <Cork> then why does unsubscibe all need to be a separate option?
[06:02:23] <Cork> if none are checked == unsubscribe all
[06:02:39] <Cork> i don't see why it should be a separate option
[06:03:16] <islalobo> Well, it is
[06:04:22] <islalobo> That is the way creative mocked it up and it makes sense with the workflow. I'm just asking for help getting the js to work
[06:07:45] <islalobo> Looking for help getting this js working: http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/7/
[06:07:52] <Cork> islalobo: http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/8/
[06:08:07] <Cork> also again you want to add some <label>s to that form
[06:08:13] <Cork> or it will be annoying to work with
[06:09:01] <islalobo> Cork++
[06:09:04] <islalobo> Thank you
[06:09:43] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/xf024d0w/9/
[06:10:06] <Omar-> islalobo you can do somthing like this http://jsfiddle.net/xsd4pfno/
[06:10:51] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/xsd4pfno/1/
[06:19:40] <Cork> Omar-: ugg delegate that event handler...
[06:21:01] <Erwat> Cork: explain to me what the delegate there is
[06:21:21] <Cork> Erwat: you bind the change event handler on a common parent
[06:21:29] <Cork> instead of 5 times (once for each checkbox)
[06:22:16] <Erwat> i see
[06:27:42] <Omar-> Cork what do you mean?
[06:28:22] <Cork> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/xsd4pfno/3/
[06:28:48] <Omar-> Cork is it better to delegate?
[06:28:55] <Omar-> than binding it directly?
[06:29:07] <Cork> if you do it on multiple elements, yes
[06:29:55] <Omar-> i thought it was much better to do it that way (no delegation)
[06:30:11] <Omar-> I delegate event for dynamically added elements
[06:30:16] <Cork> Omar-: each event handler you bind slows down the dom
[06:30:36] <Cork> you want to not add additional event handlers if a shared one can do the job
[06:30:37] <Omar-> i see, thanks for thr tip :)
[06:30:48] <Omar-> yea of course
[06:34:53] <Omar-> Cork so this should be better
[06:34:55] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/xsd4pfno/5/
[06:35:29] <Cork> ya, though i would prob go with a class on the elements instead
[06:35:36] <Cork> it simplifies the code a lot
[06:36:29] <Omar-> Cork definitely will be easier. I just like to play with jQ functions
[06:36:46] <Omar-> I tried it with .filter() but looked complicated
[06:36:51] <Cork> i like simple code, and as little of it as possible
[06:36:53] <Cork> :)
[06:38:17] <Omar-> maybr i'm used to jQM where most of elements are dynamic
[06:38:34] <Omar-> or ppl used to ask questions about handling dynamic elements
[06:38:39] <Cork> ya, jqm likes to promote js first
[06:38:47] <Cork> and is the primary reason why i don't like it
[06:39:25] <Omar-> it's a bit complicated sometimes
[06:39:47] <Cork> well ya, if you want compatibility for older mobile browsers
[06:39:58] <Cork> you will have to do some crazy shit
[06:40:20] <Omar-> btw, not all platforms are supported
[06:40:33] <Cork> i know
[06:40:44] <Omar-> http://jquerymobile.com/browser-support/1.4/
[06:44:20] <Kartagis> Omar-: like IE5.5 and so *g*
[06:45:10] <Cork> Apple iOS 3.x and older would prob be the biggest one
[06:46:25] <Omar-> i guess mainly because of CSS support
[06:47:04] <Cork> ios3 and older is quite horribly broken
[06:47:20] <Cork> it bugs out all over the place
[06:47:30] <Cork> (in web)
[06:47:50] <Omar-> web development isn't an easy job
[06:48:10] <Omar-> front-end to be precise
[06:49:09] <Cork> well it is, if you don't have to support very old browsers
[06:49:30] <Cork> but ya if you need to support things older then a year or two it gets hard fast
[06:49:37] <killa_kyle> can someone give me an idea of how to do the animated counters like the one 3/4ths of the way down this page? http://www.hubspot.com/
[06:51:21] <notchris> I have a script that pulls information to create a Facebook feed.
[06:51:39] <notchris> Lately, I‚Äôm getting an issue where the FB CDN causes huge load times
[06:51:59] <notchris> Has anyone every experienced a similar issue when dealing with FB related scripts?
[06:52:03] <Omar-> Cork true, things change so fast
[06:52:35] <Omar-> killa_kyle this is CSS filter, look up css filters
[06:52:43] <Omar-> I guess
[06:53:48] <Omar-> killa_kyle filter grayscale()
[06:54:15] <Omar-> !mdn grayscale
[06:54:16] <b-ot> Omar-: filter - CSS | MDN ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter
[06:54:51] <islalobo> Not able to get this js to work on my site: http://jsfiddle.net/4wp3023t/ jquery should be good. I must be using the wrong selectors or soemthing. hoping to get a few more eyes...
[06:55:03] <Omar-> killa_kyle http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-filters
[06:55:34] <islalobo> Nevermind! I did have the wrong selectors!
[06:55:49] <notchris> Can I set a max time a script is allowed to be loaded for.
[06:56:01] <notchris> Can I cancel loading a script if it exceeds X time?
[06:56:39] <killa_kyle> Omar- the filter is filling the circle right? how are the numbers animated?
[06:56:45] <Cork> killa_kyle, Omar-: note that grayscale only works in ff 35
[06:57:05] <Cork> so if you need firefox support you will have to host an external svg file
[06:57:10] <Omar-> islalobo yup you forgot -1 in ID
[06:57:14] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/4wp3023t/1/
[06:57:54] <islalobo> However, it still doesn't work on my site. So I need to do some more debugging :/
[06:57:56] <Omar-> killa_kyle transtion is used to do so
[07:04:29] <Omar-> killa_kyle here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/4x8knudp/
[07:04:51] <Omar-> tested in chrome only
[07:05:18] <Omar-> islalobo make sure you dont have duplicate IDs and double check your selectors
[07:08:06] <islalobo> Omar-: I copied it directly from my site and adjusted the version of jquery used by jsfiddle and updated my jquery on my site: http://jsfiddle.net/4wp3023t/2/
[07:08:12] <islalobo> It works on jsfiddle, but not my site
[07:08:22] <Omar-> Cork true, doesnt work in FF 34
[07:08:37] <Cork> Omar-: it would if you used the url() syntax for filter
[07:08:43] <Cork> (only in firefox though)
[07:08:58] <Cork> but you should at least have the filter: property so ie works
[07:09:10] <Cork> (ie11 :) )
[07:09:21] <Omar-> -moz-filter has no effect
[07:09:33] <Cork> ya, inline filter rules landed in 34
[07:09:36] <Cork> behind a pref
[07:09:51] <Omar-> Cork how url() syntax?
[07:09:54] <killa_kyle> Omar- I found this http://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/progressbar.js/ which looks like it'll do what I want
[07:09:57] <Omar-> dont know about this
[07:10:12] <Cork> Omar-: put the filters in an svg file and referende them by id
[07:10:21] <Cork> url(url-to-file.svg#id);
[07:10:23] <Omar-> islalobo the code in fiddle works well. Do you have a live link to your website?
[07:10:44] <Cork> that should work since ~ff3 or so
[07:10:58] <islalobo> It's protected :/
[07:11:14] <islalobo> It's drupal though, so I'm asking on there as well. Maybe there is some trick I'm missing
[07:11:19] <Omar-> Cork i'll try that
[07:11:37] <islalobo> I can see the js script in the document <head> so I know it is loading...
[07:11:49] <Cork> Omar-: in firefox you can do about:config?filter=layout.css.filters.enabled
[07:11:54] <Cork> and enable it there
[07:12:01] <Cork> though it is a bit buggy before ff35
[07:14:50] <alexclark> If i have a scroll event that is based on positions on the page, is there a way to update those positions without removing the event and reattaching it?
[07:15:32] <Cork> based on a position?
[07:16:41] <alexclark> Cork, yeah im setting some fixed elements to stop at the bottom of the page
[07:17:17] <alexclark> the page has disqus, disqus loads, someone posts a comment and now the bottom of the page is much lower
[07:19:05] <axilla> man i'm stumped
[07:19:19] <axilla> Cork, so i made some changes to force focus and i'm still getting weird results when hitting enter

[07:39:34] <DRSK> Randomizing a number between 0 and 20 atm, how can I specifically "make" that between 2 and 18? so +2 min and -2 max?
[07:40:24] <DRSK> items.length is 10 and I'm randomizing between them and then selecting one of the items using eq() although I would like to prevent it from selecting the first 2 and last 2 basically.
[07:40:48] <m1su> just random to 16 and add 2?
[07:41:09] <DRSK> m1su ¬ª well the .length can be 100, still I would want it to be 2-98 ^^
[07:41:47] <m1su> just randomize between 0 and item.length-2 and add 2 to that
[07:42:01] <m1su> item.length-4 even
[07:42:34] <DRSK> so them Math.min( Math.random * ( length -4 ) ) ish?
[07:42:45] <DRSK> erm, a 0 in there somewhere as well ;p
[07:43:34] <DRSK> randoms = Math.min( 0, Math.floor( ( Math.random() * itemsTotal ) - 2 );
[07:43:41] <DRSK> might work, gonna try it out ^^
[07:44:22] <m1su> Math.min will return the lowest value, so that will result in 0 everytime
[07:44:28] <DRSK> argh
[07:48:51] <DRSK> Ah think I got it; random =  Math.min( Math.max( parseInt( Math.floor( ( Math.random() * itemsTotal ) ) ), 2 ), itemsTotal - 2 );
[07:52:14] <m1su> that looks way overcomplicated
[07:53:12] <DRSK> I might not need that parseInt nor Math.floor ;o
[07:53:14] <BillCriswell> DRSK: ... what are you trying to do?
[07:53:30] <xec> wouldnt Math.floor(Math.random()*16)+2 work?
[07:53:31] <m1su> he's trying to get a random number between 2 and 18 :)
[07:53:40] <xec> random 0-16 + 2 = random 2-18
[07:53:41] <DRSK> BillCriswell ¬ª well, basically I'm trying to random a number using itemsTotal but to make sure it's always +2 from min and -2 from max
[07:53:45] <m1su> xec: ye thats what i said
[07:54:16] <BillCriswell> Math.ceil( Math.random() * 16 ) + 2; ?
[07:54:30] <DRSK> Well, xec and m1su -- items.total can be 20 or 200 or 8561 well, it's not *set*
[07:54:45] <m1su> and?
[07:54:46] <xec> DRSK: sounds like some simple math
[07:54:52] <m1su> you always want to skip the first and last 2?
[07:55:09] <xec> just remove 4 and then random and then add 2 ?
[07:55:10] <BillCriswell> Math.ceil( Math.random() * max - min ) + min; ?
[07:55:22] <BillCriswell> Er, Math.ceil( Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;
[07:55:22] <m1su> -2*min
[07:55:39] <DRSK> Yeah, I want to make sure it never gets below 2 and always make sure it's 2 less than itemsTotal
[07:56:17] <xec> Math.ceil(Math.random() * (itemsTotal - 4)) + 2 then ?
[07:56:54] <DRSK> Hmm
[07:57:18] <DRSK> Yeah!
[07:58:03] <DRSK> I don't get it though. Round up the number we get from getting a random number and multiplying it with X then removing 4 adding 2? Ugh my head.
[07:58:30] <xec> DRSK: well, do you know what Math.random() returns?
[07:58:42] <R13ose> How come when I click Updates & Videos link in header nothing showing up at all?  The page is http://www.ecosanity.org/blogsanity/website-redux-2015 and the file is uv.js
[07:59:08] <DRSK> xec ¬ª no idea really, something between 0 and 1?
[07:59:40] <xec> DRSK: yes. so if you want a random number between 0 and 10 instead you just multiply by 10
[07:59:48] <DRSK> wow facepalm
[08:00:00] <DRSK> then that explains the ceil as well
[08:00:06] <xec> right :)
[08:00:10] <DRSK> right ok thanks guys :)
[08:00:31] <xec> .ceil is correct and not .floor as I had it first, because it goes from 0 to 0.9999999 etc (never 1)
[08:01:03] <DRSK> erm, I got another one for you then!
[08:01:59] <DRSK> I'm doing some mumbojumbo using .animate marginTop value, however I'm doing this in an $.each() though. Any idea how I could make "each" happen after the other?
[08:02:15] <DRSK> rather than all at the same time?
[08:02:47] <DRSK> setTimeout maybe but how'd I increase the delay by say.. 800ms for each iteration in the each? O.o
[08:02:56] <xec> if it's on the same element jquery (i assume that's what you're using) usually queues up the animates by default
[08:03:13] <DRSK> Okay, right I recall something about it queueing stuff
[08:04:46] <xec> but sure, setTimeout works too, just take the current index and multiply by whatever
[08:05:27] <DRSK> xec ¬ª http://jsfiddle.net/53o8rc6b/ that's what I've got atm
[08:06:02] <DRSK> Line 32 is the animate I was talking about; so yeah erm supplying the each function(e) I can use e.index and do that * 800 or so?
[08:06:04] <xec> theres a syntax error there
[08:06:31] <xec> on line 33 you probably want "-" + instad of just -
[08:07:24] <DRSK> for w/e reason it is actually moving the items as I would want it to but yeah I can look into that. You mean the first - after margin-top: ?
[08:07:42] <xec> oh if it works its probably fine then
[08:07:59] <xec> the concatenation later on makes it a string i guess
[08:08:09] <DRSK> Could I just.. somehow add { queue: something } to the animate params?
[08:08:49] <xec> hmm. not sure. 'this' will be different elements
[08:09:02] <xec> so thats why they aren't queuing as is
[08:12:20] <xec> DRSK: if you wanted to try setTimeout it would work something like this http://jsfiddle.net/53o8rc6b/2/
[08:14:24] <DRSK> Ah gonna try it out :)) thanks
[08:15:29] <DRSK> xec ¬ª for some reason I'm getting  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'position' in undefined
[08:16:13] <xec> right, 'this' keyword is probably not working
[08:16:17] <xec> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/53o8rc6b/3/
[08:16:52] <xec> DRSK: the second parameter sent to the .each() function callback is the element, so you can use that instead
[08:17:08] <R13ose> Any ideas on my problem?
[08:17:49] <DRSK> xec ¬ª awesome!
[08:17:52] <DRSK> tyvm :))
[08:20:09] <xec> yw :)
[08:21:37] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Need more detail. What are you expecting to happen?
[08:22:01] <R13ose> BillCriswell: for the overlay and frontmiddlearea divs to appear.
[08:22:17] <BillCriswell> Where you you binding that?
[08:22:33] <BillCriswell> And why do you have javascript:void(0) in the link?
[08:23:46] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I want to have that as a clickable link but not add anything to the url address area.
[08:24:14] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Ok, there's better ways to do that.
[08:24:33] <R13ose> BillCriswell: like?
[08:25:11] <BillCriswell> R13ose: event.preventDefault() in the event listener. Where are you binding the click event to show the overlay?
[08:25:36] <xec> http://www.ecosanity.org/sites/all/themes/ecoSanity/js/uv.js
[08:25:38] <xec> i think
[08:25:51] <xec> but i tried setting a breakpoint in there and it doesnt seem to fire :/
[08:25:59] <BillCriswell> xec: What a sleuth haha
[08:26:04] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I do javascript:event.preventDefault()?
[08:26:10] <BillCriswell> R13ose: No.
[08:27:08] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Where you do $('#uv a').click( do $('#uv a').click( function(event) { event.preventDefault(); /* Then the code you have */ });
[08:27:33] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I thought so but what do I put in a href=""?
[08:28:09] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I'd make it #id-of-element-to-be-shown
[08:28:43] <BillCriswell> so in the event of no JS (not sure why i still think of there not being JS available) it'll still get the user to the related content.
[08:28:44] <xec> i gotta go, good luck guys
[08:28:53] <BillCriswell> xec: Later!
[08:29:01] <R13ose> xec: lates
[08:30:00] <R13ose> BillCriswell: Do I need to do this for both clicks?
[08:30:30] <BillCriswell> If the close button is a link then yeah.
[08:32:18] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I changed all of that and still not showing up on that page.
[08:32:48] <BillCriswell> There's errors in your JS.
[08:34:41] <R13ose> BillCriswell: fixing
[08:42:15] <dylmye-jq> hi! I have a jQuery xml to variable script set up, however I seem to not be able to grasp the .each function. Can anyone help with this -> http://jsfiddle.net/naLhy1ce/  (it's supposed to create one span for each station-object)
[08:43:23] <robertmaxrees> there's only one stations object, yeah?
[08:43:31] <robertmaxrees> oh, station-object
[08:43:33] <Cr0vaX> hi there, how may I debug a parseerror from a json? it is a post method
[08:44:09] <robertmaxrees> dylmye-jq http://jsfiddle.net/naLhy1ce/1/
[08:44:24] <robertmaxrees> Cr0vaX it should tell you exactly what the error was.
[08:44:26] <dylmye-jq> robertmaxrees thanks!
[08:44:42] <dylmye-jq> I see what's wrong now. Do I need to credit you?
[08:44:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[08:45:01] <dylmye-jq> thanks regardless. Have a nice day/night
[08:45:06] <robertmaxrees> of course :
[08:46:29] <robertmaxrees> Cr0vaX what does the error say in your console?
[08:47:03] <Glaisher> Hi. I'm trying to add an invert selection for checkboxes using jquery.
[08:47:04] <Glaisher> http://pastebin.com/wBErQ3bm
[08:47:06] <Glaisher> it's not working
[08:47:20] <Glaisher> can someone tell me what exactly is wrong there?
[08:47:21] <Glaisher> all and none works
[08:47:21] <Glaisher> invert doesn't work
[08:47:33] <Cr0vaX> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/wowodwt9/1/ here is the jquery I'm using, and I use console.log(textStatus); and the result was parseerror in the console
[08:47:47] <robertmaxrees> Glaisher can you setup a fiddle with your markup?
[08:48:08] <robertmaxrees> Cr0vaX what does the returned data look like?
[08:48:11] <R13ose> BillCriswell: not sure how to fix this.
[08:48:12] <Glaisher> robertmaxrees: it's a huge php file.
[08:48:35] <robertmaxrees> Glaisher a small, self-contained example should be sufficient.  i can cook it up for you if you're confused by what i mean.
[08:50:09] <Cr0vaX> robertmaxrees: the first time I run the code everything goes fine and it goes to request.done function, the second time it goes to request.fail with that, I'm using json_encode on an array, and in PHP side it looks like this: "{"success":true,"error":""}"
[08:50:41] <robertmaxrees> Cr0vaX try wrapping the data in a JSON.parse();
[08:51:23] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I'd wrap `if (url.indexOf("?")` block in like if(url) { /* code you have */ }
[08:51:52] <robertmaxrees> Glaisher http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gz0ysfx4/
[08:51:54] <robertmaxrees> seems to work fine.
[08:52:29] <sweb> is there any good condition for check is browser support jquery 2.x ? if('WebSocket' in window) { // moderb browser
[08:52:42] <BillCriswell> Why an iframe wouldn't have a src I have no idea but that's another story.
[08:52:43] <robertmaxrees> sweb huh?
[08:52:50] <Cr0vaX> robertmaxrees:you mean using JSON.parse() in the data I send to the ajax request?
[08:52:58] <robertmaxrees> Cr0vaX the data you get back.
[08:53:06] <sweb> i need to load jquery 2 in modern browser and 1.x in old browsers
[08:53:06] <robertmaxrees> sweb http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[08:53:07] <Cr0vaX> ok
[08:53:16] <robertmaxrees> sweb just load 1.x is all and call it a day.
[08:53:39] <robertmaxrees> Cr0vaX without seeing a copy of the data you're getting back it's really hard to know why you're getting a parse error.
[08:53:50] <Glaisher> robertmaxrees: is that the exact code which I pastebin'd?
[08:54:12] <robertmaxrees> Glaisher i checked your original code to make sure it works and made a small tweak that also works.
[08:54:14] <Glaisher> it doesn't seem to work locally
[08:54:29] <Glaisher> hm
[08:54:30] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I am not sure but that worked.  One other question if I am using mobile devices like tablets or smartphones, I should use click instead of hover?
[08:54:33] <sweb> robertmaxrees: if i load 1.x for modern browser i loss performance such as querySelectorAll
[08:54:43] <robertmaxrees> sweb huh?
[08:54:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not true at all.
[08:54:50] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Yes.
[08:54:53] <robertmaxrees> Glaisher because your code isn't properly formatted.
[08:55:04] <R13ose> BillCriswell: thanks.
[08:55:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gz0ysfx4/1/ Glaisher
[08:55:24] <robertmaxrees> you were missing a closing });
[08:55:37] <robertmaxrees> sweb the most recent 1.x has the same features as the most recent 2.x
[08:55:56] <Glaisher> oh
[08:55:58] <Glaisher> thanks
[08:56:08] <robertmaxrees> sweb the only difference is browser support - jquery (and sizzle) check to see what features are supported in the browser before running selectors.
[08:56:27] <R13ose> BillCriswell++
[08:56:28] <micrypt> Does anyone know how to pass options to the Boostrap/jQuery version of BlueImp's Gallery script?
[08:56:29] <R13ose> afk
[08:56:34] <robertmaxrees> so you'll get the benefits of getElementById/querySelector/whatever else on browsers that support it.
[09:05:16] <joshfarrant> Hey all, do any of you guys use Slack?
[09:06:20] <robertmaxrees> if you're looking for help, just ask your question :)
[09:07:04] <joshfarrant> To be honest I'm looking for feedback
[09:08:03] <robertmaxrees> is it a library or something?
[09:08:04] <joshfarrant> I've got a little Chrome Extension that plays nicely with it and am just after a bit of feedback on everything about it - code, design, ux, anything
[09:08:41] <joshfarrant> It's pretty basic stuff really https://github.com/joshfarrant/slack-clicky
[09:09:07] <robertmaxrees> what is slack?
[09:09:25] <joshfarrant> slack.com
[09:10:05] <robertmaxrees> oh.  you might have more luck in #web for something like that maybe?
[09:10:31] <joshfarrant> Ok cool, will have a look there, thanks Rob!
[09:25:00] <killa_kyle> I'm working on a progress bar and the text inside of it is rendering fine on desktop/responsive testing, but on my physical phone it's broken. here's a screenshot http://bit.ly/14Qiklx
[09:25:23] <killa_kyle> how do I debug this if it's not broken in the inspector view?
[09:27:52] <robertmaxrees> ask in #css for ideas - the best i've got would be to use a remote debugger.
[09:28:57] <BillCriswell> killa_kyle: Are you on a Mac with an iPhone or whatever?
[09:29:39] <killa_kyle> yeah
[09:30:10] <BillCriswell> killa_kyle: You can hook them up together through USB and Safari has a "Debug" menu that'll allow you to inspect.
[09:30:28] <BillCriswell> killa_kyle: http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/quick-tip-using-web-inspector-to-debug-mobile-safari--webdesign-8787
[09:30:50] <killa_kyle> sick, I'll check it out BillCriswell
[09:31:18] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++ i forget you have that option.
[09:32:25] <killa_kyle> just fired up safari osx and realize that it's broken on that too :(
[09:32:34] <BillCriswell> killa_kyle: Haha there you go.
[09:33:05] <Eels> Evening! http://plakplek.be/test/scripts/toggleVisibility.js - If I hide all sections and then show a category, it skips part of the animation. Any ideas?
[09:33:36] <hrust> how do I select td element with text filter? Something like :contains() selector but I need text to be equals.. Do I have to use filter?
[09:33:54] <robertmaxrees> hrust do you want a sibling that contains text?
[09:34:03] <robertmaxrees> or only select the next one if it contains a string?
[09:34:57] <hrust> I have a table and want to check if tr.someclass.text() == 'sth'
[09:35:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost now.
[09:35:58] <robertmaxrees> you want to see if an element has a class that contains some text?
[09:36:13] <hrust> sorry
[09:36:31] <hrust> I want to check if any tr contains some text
[09:36:53] <hrust> td*
[09:37:27] <hrust> if any cell in table contains given string
[09:37:44] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't just text for the text in the entire table?
[09:38:39] <robertmaxrees> because you can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/snp755qp/
[09:41:03] <hrust> robertmaxrees: ok but I have to edit value?
[09:41:15] <killa_kyle> BillCriswell I solved it. thanks!
[09:41:28] <robertmaxrees> hrust so you want the <td> that contains the text so you can do something to that TD later on?
[09:41:39] <hrust> yes
[09:41:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .filter() for that then.
[09:42:00] <BillCriswell> killa_kyle: Nice.
[09:42:00] <robertmaxrees> you can use :contains(), but that makes it hard to read imo.
[09:42:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/snp755qp/1/
[09:43:01] <hrust> but contains return also element if its not equal, right?
[09:43:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:43:20] <BillCriswell> hrust: That would be a very useless thing.
[09:43:42] <hrust> BillCriswell: ? what thing?
[09:43:50] <hrust> u mean contains?
[09:43:51] <shoky> think he means, not equal, just contains
[09:43:57] <BillCriswell> :contains()
[09:43:59] <robertmaxrees> the contains selector gives you all elements that contains the given text.
[09:44:12] <robertmaxrees> if that text appears as a substring anywhere.
[09:44:20] <hrust> yeah but I need equals so its not good for me :)
[09:44:23] <shoky> e.g. text is "abc"  but :contains(a)  will find it even though a is not equal to abc
[09:44:24] <BillCriswell> contains() just does .indexOf() on the text, right?
[09:44:44] <robertmaxrees> then you want http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/snp755qp/2/
[09:45:10] <hrust> yeah thats what i want
[09:45:12] <BillCriswell> hrust: Oh, thought you wanted just an indexOf type deal.
[09:45:40] <BillCriswell> $('td').filter(function() { return $.trim($(this).text()) === someString; }); perhaps.
[09:46:11] <hrust> yeah but I was wondering if I could use it without selector
[09:46:20] <hrust> ok then
[09:46:24] <hrust> I ll use filer :)
[09:46:35] <hrust> filter even
[09:46:45] <hrust> thanks
[09:46:49] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:50:19] <hrust> btw does those functions(filter) requires same time complexity as $(myselector).each(function(){ condition });
[09:50:28] <hrust> ?
[09:51:10] <hrust> and $('myselector [name="somevalue"]')
[09:51:12] <hrust> etc.
[09:51:58] <BillCriswell> hrust: myselect [name="somevalue"] can probably use querySelectorAll so that might be alittle faster.
[09:52:23] <BillCriswell> .filter() is essentially looping through them all. I wouldn't worry about time here.
[09:53:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah don't worry too much about the performance implications until it becomes an issue.
[09:54:05] <hrust> ok I am not worried but just curious how it works
[09:54:59] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, what exactly does passing an anonymous function to $() do?
[09:55:23] <Scriptonaut> like: %(function() { $('#blah').datetimepicker({ pickTime: false }); });
[09:55:30] <robertmaxrees> document ready.
[09:55:39] <Scriptonaut> oh, just shorthand?
[09:55:48] <robertmaxrees> any function passed to $() is treated just like $(document).ready();
[09:56:06] <Scriptonaut> does it hoist it to a global $(document).ready(), or does it have a separate binding for each?
[09:56:15] <robertmaxrees> neither?
[09:56:23] <robertmaxrees> they all run in the order they were attached.
[09:56:29] <Scriptonaut> oh
[09:58:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do anything special to the language wrt functions.
[09:58:37] <zeroquake> what is good stratergy to fill data from ordered array into x number of columns ?
[09:59:00] <robertmaxrees> forEach() through the array and go from there?
[09:59:21] <hrust> I have one more questions about numbers in javascript. What is the best way to substract two numbers. toFixed() function? like (5.043 - 0.00134).toFixed(5) ?
[09:59:45] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:59:47] <zeroquake> let me try it out with temp variable resetting after filling the xth column
[09:59:54] <robertmaxrees> why are you using .toFixed(), hrust?
[10:00:19] <hrust> robertmaxrees becouse sometimes i get wierd numbers :D
[10:00:59] <robertmaxrees> hrust ... right, because you're doing math in JS.  the common strategy is to multiply by 10, 100, 1000, etc to get out of decimals, do your math, then divide by that number to get the result you want.
[10:01:43] <hrust> oohhh I see
[10:02:02] <robertmaxrees> don't use .toFixed() to do that :) but avoid doing math in JS if at all possible.
[10:04:40] <hrust> robertmaxrees: why? isnt it better to do work at client side than server?
[10:04:55] <robertmaxrees> depends entirely on what you're doing.
[10:05:19] <hrust> query db and do some calc with result
[10:05:27] <robertmaxrees> do that server-side.
[10:05:33] <robertmaxrees> javascript and math don't mix.
[10:05:41] <hrust> :)
[10:06:01] <hrust> in query statement or on resultset?
[10:06:03] <robertmaxrees> especially if you're already hitting the server.
[10:06:26] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what your setup looks like, but do it in the server-side language, not in the DB.
[10:06:47] <hrust> ok :)
[10:07:48] <hrust> thanks 4 all
[10:17:54] <killa_kyle> ok. making progress on my progress bars
[10:18:26] <killa_kyle> now trying to figure out how to have static text inside of the ciricle along with the dynamic numbers
[10:18:27] <killa_kyle> http://codepen.io/killa-kyle/pen/dPNBZz
[10:19:16] <killa_kyle> I'm using this script: https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js
[10:20:04] <killa_kyle> in the examples it only has a number, but I want static info separate from the animated number.
[10:28:54] <ashopin> Afternoon all. I need a bit of help troubleshooting an error I'm getting. I'm integrating a framework into an existing site and am getting a TypeError: undefined is not an object. I integrated into a vanilla site and it worked. This site is loading a few other JS files. I'm not sure how to find out which is causing the conflict.
[10:29:28] <robertmaxrees> ashopin you should have some kind of stack trace in your console.
[10:29:54] <ashopin> robertmaxrees: i'm using Safari but have Chrome & Firefox.
[10:30:07] <ashopin> I can see the error in the console section but not under debugger
[10:30:36] <robertmaxrees> try using chrome or FF - you should get an arrow next to the error message that shows you where the error is coming from./
[10:30:40] <robertmaxrees> not sure about Safari.
[10:30:51] <ashopin> Ok i'll take a look
[10:36:10] <axilla> hi all, I have a form i'm submitting that some of the fields are changed via ajax before submit.. how can I add those newly added elements to my dom so that when I submit the form they get submitted too?
[10:36:33] <robertmaxrees> when are you adding them?
[10:36:57] <axilla> in the view, the text fields are changed via a dropdown selector
[10:37:18] <axilla> if i dont change the fields with the dropdown they get submitted just fine, but once they're changed they no longer are submitted.
[10:37:25] <robertmaxrees> as long as the inputs are added to the form you should be fine.
[10:37:31] <axilla> i'm assuming its because its asyn and the fields aren't in the dom when it's submitted.
[10:37:34] <robertmaxrees> unless you're trying to submit the form while the ajax is running.
[10:37:39] <axilla> shouldn't be
[10:37:56] <axilla> 200 ok in console before i submit
[10:38:00] <Sal> hi
[10:38:10] <robertmaxrees> so the update and submit are two separate things, axilla?
[10:38:24] <robertmaxrees> because in that case it sounds like you're not appending your inputs to the right place.
[10:38:29] <robertmaxrees> how are you seeing the values of the inputs?
[10:38:40] <axilla> https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/6f3a224b8578bc5b80ac
[10:39:23] <robertmaxrees> very little of this means anything to me >.>
[10:39:38] <robertmaxrees> the frontend markup is what's important.
[10:39:51] <axilla> robertmaxrees: added another file forgot to put the .js.erb file in there that updates the view
[10:39:57] <robertmaxrees> markup?
[10:40:05] <axilla> i put the frontend markup in there as well
[10:40:06] <robertmaxrees> i also don't see where you call switch_metagroup_dropdowns.
[10:40:19] <robertmaxrees> i see a bunch of template files.
[10:40:21] <axilla> switch_metagroup_dropdowns is called on init
[10:40:43] <axilla> $('.box_metaterms select').on('change', ImageRelay.boxes.switch_metagroup_dropdowns);
[10:40:58] <robertmaxrees> and where are you appending content?
[10:41:18] <axilla> refresh, i added metagroup_dropdown.js.erb
[10:41:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:41:28] <axilla> i update the .html of the div
[10:41:42] <axilla> with the new text_fields
[10:41:54] <robertmaxrees> rendered markup would be better siunce i don't know ruby templating, and your js has no knowledge of that anyway.
[10:42:32] <axilla> i'm using rails unobtrusive javascript to update the view without refreshing the page.
[10:42:37] <axilla> all of that works just fine.
[10:42:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:42:48] <robertmaxrees> i have no cluie how to help you then.
[10:42:52] <axilla> its ok :)
[10:42:54] <axilla> thanks for trying
[10:43:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd highly suggest tossing out the rendered stuff instead of the ruby stuff.
[10:44:22] <axilla> i can't unfortunatley it loads in a box iframe
[10:44:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:44:28] <axilla> and that's probably why the dom isn't updating
[10:44:33] <axilla> i'm creating a app for box.com
[10:44:37] <axilla> for our app
[10:44:40] <robertmaxrees> sure you can - you can copy the markup of the iframe just fine.
[10:44:43] <axilla> so the view is in a iframe from box.com
[10:44:47] <axilla> all i see is the iframe markup
[10:44:50] <axilla> in source
[10:45:03] <robertmaxrees> if you're trying to update content in the iframe from outside of the iframe, you might be running into CORS issues.
[10:45:16] <axilla> probably what it is.
[10:45:25] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you need to use .contents() when targeting content in an iframe.
[10:45:25] <axilla> i think i need to ask them for CORS access now that you mention it
[12:00:19] <HikaruBG> hi guys
[12:01:27] <robertmaxrees> hello
[12:03:56] <HikaruBG> I am looking for input masking plugin that will work with Android phones
[12:05:42] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG https://github.com/RobinHerbots/jquery.inputmask maybe?
[12:06:42] <HikaruBG> robertmaxrees, thanks - I will check it out.
[12:06:45] <HikaruBG> anyone else?
[12:13:08] <Mkop> I have code with a selector like $('[name=template_event[deposit_contract_type]]'). did that kind of selector break in more recent versions of jquery?
[12:13:31] <Mkop> I can fix it by escaping the inner brackets, but just want to make sure that my diagnosis is correct
[12:13:33] <BillCriswell> Mkop: You probably have to quote.
[12:13:47] <robertmaxrees> i don't know that it broke recently.  that doesn't look like it'd ever work.
[12:13:47] <BillCriswell> $('[name="template_event[deposit_contract_type]"]')
[12:13:53] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Agreed.
[12:14:13] <Mkop> darn. so now I need to dig - why didn't this code give problems in the past?
[12:14:30] <robertmaxrees> are you sure that's the case?
[12:14:58] <Mkop> well, the users have never complained in the past ;-)
[12:15:10] <BillCriswell> Mkop: Could have just been lucky lol
[12:15:14] <robertmaxrees> heh, you'd be surprised how long bugs can go unnoticed.
[12:15:43] <Mkop> no. the error shows up when you click "create", and there are things on the page that are created.
[12:16:05] <Mkop> it's possible that some change deeper in the PHP stuff caused the markup of the page to change
[12:16:21] <robertmaxrees> i just spot checked down to 1.6.4 and they all tossed errors.
[12:16:37] <BillCriswell> The markup wouldn't change how the selector works.
[12:17:02] <robertmaxrees> unless they're generating selectors.
[12:18:52] <benlieb> Is the fact that 1 == "1" an intended "feature" of the language?
[12:19:06] <robertmaxrees> it's why we have 1 === "1"
[12:19:07] <robertmaxrees> but yes
[12:20:11] <robertmaxrees> equality with coercion
[12:20:53] <benlieb> I can see why that would be useful, kind of. But I can't bring myself to use that. It feels like it could create problems. Is it common to use this?
[12:21:00] <benlieb> I read this very informative post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/664886/in-javascript-int-value-int-value-evaluates-to-true-why-is-it-so
[12:21:13] <robertmaxrees> newbies and people who don't know any better use it all the time.
[12:21:19] <robertmaxrees> often it's because they aren't aware of the gotcha.
[12:21:32] <robertmaxrees> the only case where it's at all useful is when comparing against null/undefined.
[12:21:38] <robertmaxrees> because null == undefined.
[12:22:31] <benlieb> Would you say the explanation of this issue on this page is correct? http://www.frontendjournal.com/most-common-technical-interview-question-for-frontend-developers/
[12:22:35] <benlieb> It doesn't seem so.
[12:22:42] <BillCriswell> benlieb: http://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/
[12:22:56] <benlieb> look for Difference between == and ===
[12:23:25] <robertmaxrees> benlieb that entirely depends on where you are an existing conventions.
[12:23:54] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: ?
[12:23:54] <robertmaxrees> the core concept (equality with and without coercion) are spot on, but I wouldn't say == is "useful" except for the case i noted above.
[12:24:33] <benlieb> He says: Double equals == is used to compare the value of two operands: Triple equals === is used to compare the value AND type of two operands
[12:24:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:24:39] <robertmaxrees> that is accurate.
[12:24:47] <robertmaxrees> just a funky way to phrase it.
[12:25:08] <robertmaxrees> and makes it seem like you should be using == in your day-to-day, when imo you shouldn't.
[12:25:17] <benlieb> But my current understanding is it's not comparing the values, it's comparing coerced values.
[12:25:32] <robertmaxrees> that's playing a word game.
[12:25:45] <robertmaxrees> some people would argue that the values are the same, but the type isn't.
[12:25:57] <robertmaxrees> those are people who drive me crazy.
[12:26:53] <dcherman2> robertmaxrees: just ask them to explain this snippet then:  ({ toString: function() { return "1"; }} == 1)
[12:27:24] <dcherman2> if they still claim the values are the same, you probably don't want them
[12:27:40] <robertmaxrees> dcherman2 i'm not the one asking questions :)
[12:28:40] <robertmaxrees> though that snippet is cute.
[12:30:57] <benlieb> can anything in JS have a value of null without being explicitly assigned?
[12:33:02] <robertmaxrees> i can't think of any cases, but when you're using libraries and other people's code, you can never be too sure what's happening where.
[12:34:17] <dcherman2> also depends on your definition of explicit.  is a property inherited via the prototype considered explicitly assigned?
[12:34:28] <robertmaxrees> ^ exactly.
[12:45:30] <OnceMe> Hello how can I have some music player in a background and on new click page to not stop it
[12:45:38] <OnceMe> something like soundcloud did it ?
[12:45:50] <OnceMe> so something in background is executing while Im browsing website
[12:45:54] <OnceMe> is that possible with jQuery?
[12:46:23] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to build up a largely ajax-powered site.
[12:46:30] <OnceMe> heh
[12:46:32] <robertmaxrees> which is probably how soundcloud does it.
[12:46:38] <OnceMe> so no magic way to make it this way?
[12:46:46] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[12:47:20] <_DB> how can I turn a decimal number to currency format?
[12:47:40] <_DB> 45,150.53  something like that
[12:48:10] <robertmaxrees> download a library to handle it for you.
[12:48:17] <_DB> ahh nvm lol
[12:48:21] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:48:25] <robertmaxrees> it's a massive PITA.
[12:48:28] <_DB> ill just do it on server side
[12:48:33] <robertmaxrees> even better.
[12:48:35] <OnceMe> They use eventlogger.soundcloud.com
[12:48:41] <OnceMe> they are super cool
[12:48:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:48:49] <BillCriswell> Like bread?
[12:58:12] <Es0teric> has anyone here used typeahead?
[12:58:15] <Es0teric> typeahead.js
[12:58:19] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Es0teric
[12:58:20] <b-ot> Es0teric: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:58:50] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: ok well i have an issue right now.. i have an array of objects that i am trying to create an autocomplete with on an input field which is triggered by an ajax event
[13:00:02] <robertmaxrees> ok.
[13:00:16] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: this array of objects is json
[13:00:29] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:02:28] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[13:04:48] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: the problem is multiple things, autocomplete wouldnt show
[13:04:55] <Es0teric> and i get an uncaught type error
[13:05:09] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code and a sample of the data you're returning?
[13:05:36] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yeah but its not going to be in a fiddle
[13:05:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:05:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:06:32] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: That error should point a line somewhere...
[13:06:49] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: its pointing to the typeahead line but you‚Äôll see what i mean
[13:06:49] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.  fix that line.
[13:10:11] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees, BillCriswell http://pastebin.com/0bWTGyLd
[13:10:24] <robertmaxrees> which line is throwing the error?
[13:10:33] <Es0teric> 33, robertmaxrees
[13:10:42] <robertmaxrees> so $('.gallery').typeahead({}); ?
[13:10:48] <robertmaxrees> that means the plugin isn't yet loaded.
[13:11:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: no its loaded
[13:11:34] <Es0teric> i just viewed source now
[13:11:37] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:11:57] <robertmaxrees> right before that line, do console.log($.fn.typeahead);
[13:12:00] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:12:52] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: undefined
[13:13:03] <robertmaxrees> that means typeahead asn't actually loading.
[13:13:13] <robertmaxrees> check your network panel and make sure it's not 404'ing
[13:13:25] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, check to make sure you're not loading multiple copies of jquery.
[13:13:37] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: 403
[13:13:40] <Es0teric> its probably a premission issue
[13:13:43] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[13:14:11] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Also, that stuff outisde the if seems like it should be inside of it...
[13:14:56] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: ok now i see that its a method
[13:17:51] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees, ok so now the problem is that its not showing the autocomplete titles
[13:18:01] <robertmaxrees> okay.  any console errors?
[13:18:14] <Es0teric> no, robertmaxrees
[13:19:11] <robertmaxrees> that's now how you use typeahead with ajax.
[13:20:32] <robertmaxrees> https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/ reread the docs.
[13:20:50] <robertmaxrees> basically, you init typeahead and set its source to the ajax function, which returns the data you want.
[13:27:47] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yeah i still dont understand why its not working
[13:28:12] <robertmaxrees> right now you're trying to reinitialize every time you have a keyup.
[13:29:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/RCXcwZAL
[13:30:34] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/25783432/923919
[13:30:51] <robertmaxrees> Or http://stackoverflow.com/a/12097876/923919
[13:30:53] <robertmaxrees> plenty of examples.
[13:42:39] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yeah something is breaking the js from forming the suggestions
[13:45:39] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[13:45:43] <robertmaxrees> have you tried without using ajax?
[13:46:27] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yeah
[13:46:29] <Es0teric> still same result
[13:46:39] <robertmaxrees> then your data isn't properly formatted.
[13:46:40] <Es0teric> so something is blocking it from showing the results for some strange reason
[13:46:47] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: my data is properly formatted
[13:46:50] <Es0teric> its being output in json
[13:46:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:47:04] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean it's in the format that typeahead is expecting.
[13:47:08] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it up without the ajax.,
[13:47:13] <robertmaxrees> see if it works when you have it isolated.
[13:47:30] <Es0teric> i am not going to waste my time
[13:47:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:47:36] <Es0teric> i‚Äôve already spent almost half the day on this crap
[13:47:42] <robertmaxrees> if it helps you get it working, it's not a waste.
[13:47:47] <robertmaxrees> good learning opportunity.
[13:48:24] <compact> hey guys. any idea where I can find a gantt plugin? can only find one (http://taitems.github.io/jQuery.Gantt/) however seems like it won't play with the new jquery
[13:48:55] <compact> 1.10.2
[13:49:30] <compact> oh, some reason I'm using 1.7.2
[13:52:14] <compact> and theme won't work with latest jquery
[13:52:15] <compact> how wonderful
[13:52:23] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:52:34] <robertmaxrees> that part shouldn't matter
[13:56:42] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: ok i made a breakthrough here
[13:56:53] <Es0teric> it seems that i wasnt loading the bootstrap css to display the styling
[13:57:44] <Es0teric> but now i have a dilemma.. initially, this array contains 3 keys; id, post_status and post_title.. when the user clicks on a post title, i want to pass in the ID in a hidden field value
[13:57:47] <Es0teric> how would i go about doing that
[13:57:48] <Es0teric> ?
[13:58:28] <robertmaxrees> there should be an event handler for that.
[13:58:38] <robertmaxrees> if not, a delegated listener should about do the trick.
[14:02:12] <robertmaxrees> you might have to stash the ajax data somewhere else so you can refer back to it and get the value - i'm not sure if typeahead allows you to craft custom stuff like that.
[14:06:41] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: so which one of these would i use to add the id value of that array into the hidden input? https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead
[14:06:55] <robertmaxrees> which one of what?
[14:07:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: which one of the options
[14:08:01] <robertmaxrees> yuou don't.
[14:08:27] <robertmaxrees> it won't handle that part for you.
[14:08:46] <robertmaxrees> afterSelect is where you'd run your binding.
[14:09:08] <robertmaxrees> you might have to do another call to your server to then fetch the data you want.
[14:09:23] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead#using-json-objects-instead-of-simple-strings
[14:09:25] <robertmaxrees> realy this, too.
[14:09:26] <robertmaxrees> *read
[14:09:36] <Es0teric> yeah, robertmaxrees already on it
[14:22:59] <niop> cheap shot here, but could anyone hint at how to get binding on:
[14:23:00] <niop> $('body').find('a')[3]
[14:23:01] <niop> <a href="http://localhost:3000/gallery.html">
[14:23:13] <robertmaxrees> use .eq(3) instead of [3]
[14:24:02] <niop> thanks. haven't come across eq before, rather new in jquery and running short of time with the client.
[14:24:05] <niop> will give it a try
[14:24:37] <robertmaxrees> .eq() gets you the 3rd element in the collection, but still "wrapped" in jquery so you can run standard methods against it like you'd want to.
[14:24:39] <niop> worked. perfect. saved some time.
[14:25:37] <niop> yeah had guessed was getting back raw dom, but didn't see a reason why array reference from find('a') wouldn't return a jquery object.  reference method makes the diference it seems.
[14:25:50] <robertmaxrees> .find('a') does.
[14:25:58] <robertmaxrees> [3] gets the underlying DOM node in the collection.
[14:26:19] <robertmaxrees> oh i see what you mean.
[14:26:30] <niop> well, seems on the quirky side, but as long as there's a way to do it, and proceeding with making client happy can happen.
[14:26:45] <robertmaxrees> it's a good reason for it, but i'll just leave it at that :)
[14:26:57] <niop> expeditiously.  i shall have to earn some karma before revisiting.
[14:27:54] <niop> not in much of a position to contribute given knowledge of jquery at the moment.
[14:27:56] <niop> but..
[14:28:03] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:28:22] <niop> trying mean stack, and not sure query has much of a place there.  maybe it does. but that's for another day.
[14:28:45] <robertmaxrees> angular makes use of jquery.
[14:29:05] <robertmaxrees> if it can't find it, it falls back to it's own simplified version called jqlite
[14:29:14] <niop> as to say it would be only reasonble with the wonderful expertise here, to offer some back. but i just dont know enough about jquery as yet.
[14:29:25] <niop> used angular.
[14:30:10] <niop>  and calendar popup, but just minimal jquery usage or dwelling on, again for reasons of deadlines.
[14:31:25] <niop> angular is quite nice.. but seems some people have issues with it. and some seem to be pushing an alternative.
[14:31:35] <robertmaxrees> i don't personally like angular.
[14:32:52] <niop> not long in web dev, fortunately not the experience of having worked with lesser web tech, relative to today's. but based on what i've seen of what you'd have to do to get similar behavior to angular, i'd be very thankful for it.  not just for practicalities sake, but being a purist.
[14:33:24] <robertmaxrees> i think angular runs counter to the notion of being "pure".
[14:34:24] <niop> some issues possibly. a crack or two in the fabric of web framework time space. but of that sort of subtlety it's probably not a great concern here practically speaking.
[14:34:32] <niop> pure enough
[14:34:43] <robertmaxrees> i still disagree, but meh
[14:35:58] <niop> meh
[14:36:03] <niop> for now anyway
[14:36:08] <niop> work calls
[14:53:57] <scrandad> Hey there. After a bunch of frustration and debugging I resolved a problem in all versions of IE where html() failed silently, by using append instead. Is there an explainable reason for this? I'll take the solution as magic too, but I'm just wondering for my own sanity.
[14:55:54] <mr_highway> hi!
[14:55:57] <mr_highway> http://nopaste.chaoz-irc.net/view/fdea1df1 line 124: there's no delay at all. why?
[14:56:16] <mr_highway> sorry
[14:56:21] <mr_highway> i mean line 115
[14:56:33] <Scriptonaut> what does it mean to do: $.get('/some_path/', {'query' : $('.text-input').val() }, {}, 'script')
[14:56:40] <Scriptonaut> specifically, what is $.get
[14:57:53] <shoky> `api $.get
[14:57:53] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[14:57:58] <shoky> `api jQuery.get
[14:57:58] <b-ot> shoky: jQuery.get(): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[14:59:01] <robertmaxrees> mr_highway i don't see a line 124
[14:59:19] <mr_highway> robertmaxrees: sorry i mean 115
[14:59:20] <robertmaxrees> 115 is going to run backgroundChange() immediately.
[14:59:27] <mr_highway> why?
[14:59:51] <robertmaxrees> because setTimeout() takes a reference to a function.
[15:00:07] <robertmaxrees> your code is running the function and assigning the return value to the setTimeout(), which isn't what you want.
[15:00:28] <mr_highway> hmm ok
[15:00:29] <robertmaxrees> normally you'd do setTimeout(backgroundChange,1000);
[15:00:42] <robertmaxrees> if you want to pass arguments in from there, you can use .bind()
[15:00:54] <robertmaxrees> so it'd be setTimeout(backgroundChange.bind(this, zaehler+1),1000);
[15:01:11] <mr_highway> ok i dont get this at all. ;)
[15:01:25] <mr_highway> but im very new to javascript
[15:01:41] <robertmaxrees> so let's back up then :)
[15:01:52] <robertmaxrees> what does it mean when you see someFunctionName(); ?
[15:02:22] <mr_highway> as an expression its the returnvalue of this function
[15:02:30] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:02:58] <robertmaxrees> so when you call setTimeout(someFunctionName(), 1000); what do you think is happening?
[15:03:12] <mr_highway> ok i see
[15:03:23] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:03:59] <mr_highway> but what is functionName without ()?
[15:04:17] <robertmaxrees> a reference to the object.
[15:05:08] <mr_highway> hmm
[15:05:56] <mr_highway> ok thx
[15:06:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/km7nuvt3/
[15:06:13] <mr_highway> it works now. i have to google this bind() thing :)
[15:06:20] <robertmaxrees> !g mdn bind
[15:06:21] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Function.prototype.bind() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer ... ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[15:06:48] <robertmaxrees> basically, bind() returns a copy of the function with a given 'this' value and any optional arguments.
[15:07:08] <robertmaxrees> which is helpful in this case because you don't want to immediately run that callback - you want to wait until later.
[15:07:38] <mr_highway> thank you :)
[15:08:09] <robertmaxrees> that's abusing .bind() though, since it's not really meant to do things like this.
[15:08:24] <robertmaxrees> but that's a different story.
[15:08:58] <_nerb> hey all -- i'm new to jquery, and i want to write a function that allows me to highlight specific words in a <p> tag (which i'll then use to post to a db). i'm pretty confused by the stackoverflow questions i've found, and not sure where to really begin
[15:09:24] <_nerb> anyone have any thoughts on how i might start?
[15:09:31] <robertmaxrees> _nerb that's a gross one.
[15:09:45] <_nerb> how so?
[15:09:51] <robertmaxrees> but doable.  is it all plain text inside thge <p>,or are there other tags to worry about?
[15:10:07] <_nerb> just plain text
[15:10:29] <robertmaxrees> mmk.
[15:11:07] <robertmaxrees> so you grab your .text(), take that return and pass it to .replace(), where you're replacing the matched words with the same word wrapped in a <span> or something similar.
[15:11:30] <robertmaxrees> then pass that whole mess to .html() to replace the contents of the <p>
[15:12:19] <mr_highway> robertmaxrees: is there anything like the php . operator in javascript? :)
[15:12:28] <robertmaxrees> what does that operator do?
[15:12:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm not familiar with PHP
[15:12:59] <mr_highway> ok found it its + in javascript
[15:13:06] <robertmaxrees> mr_highway concatenation of strings?
[15:13:10] <_nerb> robertmaxrees, i sort of assumed that there would be something more complicated to do in order to grab the highlighted text in the first place
[15:13:18] <mr_highway> "fu"."bar" = "fubar" in php
[15:13:36] <robertmaxrees> _nerb i'm lost - are you trying to highlight words, or grab highlighted words?
[15:13:58] <robertmaxrees> mr_highway yeah, string concatenation :)
[15:17:06] <_nerb> robertmaxrees, sorry, here's the idea: there's text in a <p> tag on the page. the user highlights the text by click and drag. as soon as the user's highlighted the text on the page, send a post request for the highlighted segment to a database. later, i want to be able to display the original text, but the viewer should be able to mouse over the words that we previously selected to see more info about them
[15:17:25] <robertmaxrees> okay - two separate things.
[15:17:32] <robertmaxrees> the second one should be managed by your backend.
[15:17:54] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/24309486/923919
[15:18:03] <robertmaxrees> this is how you get the currently highlighted text.
[15:18:34] <mr_highway> robertmaxrees:  (3+"string")=="3string" or syntax error? :)
[15:18:50] <robertmaxrees> Did You Try?‚Ñ¢
[15:18:55] <mr_highway> :D
[15:19:03] <robertmaxrees> and use ===
[15:19:05] <robertmaxrees> never ==
[15:19:18] <mr_highway> why?
[15:19:29] <robertmaxrees> because 3 == "3" is true
[15:19:33] <robertmaxrees> 3 === "3" is false.
[15:19:35] <robertmaxrees> coercion
[15:20:08] <mr_highway> ok so 3+"string" might work :P
[15:20:15] <robertmaxrees> your example before works.
[15:20:39] <robertmaxrees> you just want to do (3 + 'string') === '3string';
[15:21:17] <_nerb> awesome, thanks!
[15:21:31] <mr_highway> that's great, thx :)
[15:25:23] <mr_highway> robertmaxrees: is there a way to do this: var ID="fubar"; document.all.ID.style.color="black";
[15:25:34] <robertmaxrees> wut?
[15:25:35] <mr_highway> or must i use getelementbyid?
[15:25:54] <robertmaxrees> or $('#fubar') if you have jquery
[15:26:23] <mr_highway> to be honest: i dont even really know what jquery is ;)
[15:26:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:26:32] <robertmaxrees> there's an implicit variable created for each "id" on the page but don't ever rely on it.
[15:26:45] <robertmaxrees> and jquery is a library for in-browser development stuff.
[15:26:52] <robertmaxrees> it abstracts stuff out to make things a little les gross.
[15:27:01] <mr_highway> ok :)
[15:27:58] <robertmaxrees> you can also do something like var myThing = document.getElementById('fubar'); mything.style.color = 'black';
[15:28:33] <mr_highway> so javascript doesnt know dynamic variable names?
[15:28:49] <robertmaxrees> not really.  you can "fake" them.
[15:28:52] <robertmaxrees> property names can be dynamic.
[15:29:23] <Yonben78> Hi :)
[15:29:38] <Yonben78> I have a little question about a game I'm making in jQuery. I have a level selection page, and my level is stored in a var like a number table for each case. I'd like to have only one game page and that it would know which level to generate from the previous page. How can I do that? I hope it was clear ^^'
[15:29:55] <mr_highway> ok thank you very much m8... with all this new knowledge i go to bed now ;)
[15:30:03] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[15:30:15] <robertmaxrees> Yonben78 okay - what's the question?
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[15:30:42] <Yonben78> I think what I want is to tell the game page which level (so which variable) should be use for generation
[15:30:46] <Yonben78> from another page
[15:30:55] <robertmaxrees> Yonben78 variables don't carry across pages.
[15:31:06] <Yonben78> so what would be a possible workaround ?
[15:31:13] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to store that in a cookie, localstorage, or session management.
[15:31:19] <Yonben78> so php ?
[15:31:23] <robertmaxrees> go for the latter.
[15:31:34] <robertmaxrees> session management is going to be key here .
[15:32:02] <Yonben78> kk gonna look for it, never did it except with php :)
[15:32:13] <robertmaxrees> php will basically manage all of it.
[15:32:42] <Yonben78> but then will I be able to change level without reloading page right ?
[15:32:51] <Yonben78> (not needed now but I'm trying to foresee :p )
[15:33:00] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to tell your backend what level you're on.
[15:33:05] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[15:33:27] <Yonben78> You're talking too complicated, it's a really simple game, I never used the notions of front-end/back end :x
[15:33:33] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:33:39] <Yonben78> I'm a beginner :p
[15:33:44] <robertmaxrees> then learn.
[15:33:58] <Yonben78> That's what I'm doing ;) I'm looking for session management
[15:34:04] <Yonben78> thanks for the clue :)
[15:34:08] <robertmaxrees> which will involve effort on the frontend and backend.
[15:34:26] <Yonben78> so frontend is basically what the user sees, and backend is all what's on the server side right ?
[15:34:36] <robertmaxrees> kind of, yeah.
[15:34:50] <Yonben78> kk, jsut never used the terminology but I get it :)
[15:34:54] <Yonben78> Back to code ^
[15:44:14] <Joris> http://plakplek.be/test/scripts/menuHighlight.js - Instead of highlighting whichever menu item's in the viewport, it just keeps highlighting the first one. Any ideas?
[15:44:58] <robertmaxrees> var sectionId = $('section:in-viewport').attr('id'); probably isn't what you think it is.
[15:45:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd console.log() that out.
[15:53:29] <baako> hi guys i have an image slider i have created http://jsfiddle.net/4zm8vLq8/
[15:53:48] <baako> but the issue is that it doesn't slide to the next image. why is that?
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> because your interval code is weird.
[15:56:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4zm8vLq8/1/
[16:03:52] <Joris> http://i.imgur.com/7w9jUaB.jpg?1 - This is what console.log() looks like after scrolling down the page once. :in-viewport is a plugin.
[16:05:08] <baako> robertmaxrees: that link still does the same as the code i posted
[16:05:15] <baako> it doesn't show the next image
[16:13:34] <limbera> hi there
[16:20:36] <robertmaxrees> baako right - look at your console.
[16:29:58] <baako> robertmaxrees: consoles has not error
[16:30:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm pointing out that your logic is broken.
[16:39:29] <baako> robertmaxrees: but weird doesn't explain much but thanks anyways
[16:39:37] <robertmaxrees> it explains everything :)
[16:39:44] <robertmaxrees> you're incrementing the value before you should.
[16:40:07] <robertmaxrees> if you really want a carouself btw, just build your own.
[16:40:14] <robertmaxrees> or consider not using one at all.
[16:45:19] <baako> robertmaxrees: u said i am incrementing the value before i show. which value are u referring to please
[16:45:30] <robertmaxrees> the one i'm console.log()'ing
[16:48:03] <baako> robertmaxrees: i see your point. but how do i keep track of the current clide?
[16:48:06] <baako> slide
[16:50:53] <robertmaxrees> don't increment before you check the value :)
[16:54:38] <baako> i see so if(++currentSlide === $slides.length) {
[16:54:43] <baako> thanks robertmaxrees
[16:55:47] <robertmaxrees> noooo.
[16:57:24] <robertmaxrees> do your if first.  then increment.
[17:15:16] <jqueryius> hello. where is the best channel to ask about the appcache and offline apps?
[17:16:02] <BillCriswell> jqueryius: maybe #web?
[17:18:43] <jqueryius> BillCriswell - thanks, I'll try #web
[17:19:19] <BillCriswell> jqueryius: Here probably wouldn't hurt either... but I think #web would be most.. related?
[17:21:28] <jqueryius> BillCriswell: well, in summary I've added an offline.appcache file to my page and I've found that it seems to work ok offline in a desktop browser but on my phone if I go into airplane mode it just tells me i'm offline
[17:21:38] <jqueryius> I'm wondering if there are any gotchas I could be overlooking
[17:26:11] <BillCriswell> jqueryius: Hmmm..
[17:26:12] <jqueryius> in chrome (android) - but debugging through my computer, I just get net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED when I try and load the page
[17:27:18] <jqueryius> ah, maybe this is a clue?
[17:27:21] <jqueryius> Application Cache Error event: Resource fetch failed (6)
[17:27:30] <jqueryius> when I load it out of airplane mode
[17:27:37] <jqueryius> maybe one of the resources isn't being cached correctly?
[17:28:09] <BillCriswell> jqueryius: I am not sure. Anyone in #web bite? I'm kind of curious myself.
[17:28:28] <jqueryius> not yet, i'll try again
[17:31:24] <Joris> http://plakplek.be/test/scripts/menuHighlight.js- Okay, I've narrowed it down to line 5. On rule nine it only ever seems to compare to the first a.
[17:32:08] <robertmaxrees> "rule nine"?
[17:32:40] <Joris> *line 9
[17:32:50] <Joris> where it compares sectionID and href
[17:33:15] <Joris> Does substr() only work on the first element of the set or something?
[17:33:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:33:46] <robertmaxrees> well,a ctually.
[17:33:53] <robertmaxrees> $('ul#menu li a').attr('href')
[17:33:58] <robertmaxrees> only returns the first one.
[17:34:04] <robertmaxrees> .substr() can only work against strings.
[17:44:14] <jqueryius> BillCriswell?
[17:44:24] <jqueryius> If you saw my pastebin, I had http links in the manifest
[17:44:31] <jqueryius> I changed this to relative paths and it worked
[17:45:12] <BillCriswell> jqueryius: Shit sorry I zoned
[17:45:32] <BillCriswell> jqueryius: Good idea.
[17:46:26] <jqueryius> thanks:)
[17:57:36] <_BigWings_> anyone know how to get css width property of an element before the element is inserted into the DOM?
[17:57:56] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really exist.
[18:00:03] <_BigWings_> I can call myJqueryObj.width()
[18:00:18] <_BigWings_> and that will give me the width, even before its inserted in the dom, in firefox
[18:00:26] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[18:00:35] <_BigWings_> in chrome and IE that only works when its already part of the page
[18:00:42] <_BigWings_> absolutely
[18:01:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8La98n93/
[18:01:04] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't work in FF.
[18:01:15] <robertmaxrees> that gives me 0
[18:03:35] <_BigWings_> im not sure how to use fiddle.
[18:03:43] <robertmaxrees> which part are you stuck on?
[18:03:54] <_BigWings_> \but add a class to it.. and make a style with that class with width:10px
[18:04:12] <_BigWings_> i want to read the value from the css file basically
[18:04:15] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:04:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not really a good way to do that then.
[18:05:26] <_BigWings_> i guess I have to sign up to save a fiddle?
[18:05:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:05:33] <_BigWings_> or share it
[18:05:37] <robertmaxrees> you can hit "update"
[18:05:41] <robertmaxrees> and that'll update the fiddle.
[18:05:51] <_BigWings_> http://jsfiddle.net/8La98n93/1/
[18:05:56] <_BigWings_> that returns 100 on ff
[18:06:17] <robertmaxrees> right, again, relying on something like this to read CSS files is going to be flakey at best.
[18:07:04] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to do that?
[18:07:11] <_BigWings_> myeah.. so that means that either I have to have multiple style attributes in my css that have to match each other
[18:07:30] <_BigWings_> or I have to call myObj.width() after the object is inserted
[18:07:32] <robertmaxrees> what's the underlying problem you're trying to solve?
[18:07:39] <robertmaxrees> just read the width of nodes?
[18:08:08] <_BigWings_> im just trying to make it that my css file is as small as possible so artists can play with it without screwing things up too much
[18:08:23] <_BigWings_> I have a margin-left that should be the inverse of the width of the object
[18:08:29] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[18:08:33] <_BigWings_> so if width:10px then margin-left:-10px
[18:08:48] <robertmaxrees> if you're giving them access to the CSS, they're going to have to accept responsibility for breaking things/.
[18:08:57] <_BigWings_> I can easily specify it in the css, its just cleaner if margin-left got calculated
[18:09:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't edit css like that with JS.
[18:09:14] <_BigWings_> hehe yeah.. too bad.. on FF it works like a charm
[18:14:30] <Joris> http://jsfiddle.net/17Lmmaqm/ - Something's
[18:14:38] <Joris> wrong with line 8
[18:14:55] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't create a new var for each one.
[18:15:21] <Joris> Hold on, lemme put them in an array
[18:15:25] <robertmaxrees> don't do that either.
[18:15:28] <robertmaxrees> use an .each()
[18:15:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/17Lmmaqm/1/
[18:50:15] <Joris> Oh my, I finally got that menu highlighting thing to work. Thanks so much, robertmaxrees!
[19:15:40] <Unopoo> there is a web page which has many radio button with name "mids", and a download button, to download the selected radio item file. so i write a loop to triger .click() of each radio button, and then triger .click() of the download button: what I want to do is to download all the file corresponding all the radio button automatically
[19:15:40] <Unopoo> but i faild, only the last one is prompt for downloading
[19:15:48] <Unopoo> what am I doing wrong?
[19:16:25] <limbera> hi there
[19:16:39] <limbera> i'm trying to get a dialog to open (jqueryUI) when i click on a button but it doesn't seem to be working
[19:16:40] <limbera> http://dpaste.com/1J8FKFK
[19:18:10] <sdwrage> Anyone here use the datable plugin? I am wondering if there is a plugin that adds a drop down with a list of current columns that I restrictively search by
[19:18:28] <limbera> it seems that having the .dialog() inside of a on('click', function()) handler breaks it
[19:33:42] <cratos> folks. I'm out of ideas for this problem - http://jsfiddle.net/BurritoWhisperer/zbjk1ss1/1/ - when I choose an element from the first select, the trigger does happen but there is no UI update. How can we trigger this?

[20:03:45] <FinStick> hi, how to move to a specific dom id using jquery?
[20:06:40] <systemfault> Using the same selector as with CSS
[20:06:45] <systemfault> If you can't answer that question then learn CSS.
[20:07:46] <FinStick> systemfault: that made no sense
[20:09:00] <FinStick> systemfault: <span id="foo"></span> <- How to move to this DOM with id="foo"?
[20:09:27] <Snerf> what do you mean, move, scroll to it?
[20:10:15] <FinStick> move to it, like a fast scroll.
[20:10:35] <systemfault> The selection mecanism of jQuery uses CSS selectors so you need to know CSS to be able to use jQuery effectively.
[20:10:38] <Snerf> FinStick, chneg the (document)'s .top position
[20:10:45] <Snerf> change
[20:11:05] <systemfault> By "move", you mean select?
[20:11:21] <FinStick> systemfault: no!
[20:12:10] <FinStick> Snerf: Thanks. I didn't want to use the another bloated jquery plugin.
[20:13:24] <FinStick> Snerf: jquery scroll plugin that is.
[20:13:45] <systemfault> You need to select the element, take its position from the top using .offset() then animate 'scrollTop" to the coord you got.
[20:13:54] <Snerf> FinStick, you could have just looked at how it did it
[20:15:05] <systemfault> It would look a bit like: var topPos = $('#foo').offset().top; $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: topPos}, 250);
[20:21:42] <FinStick> Snerf: I could but it would make life more difficult.
[20:24:06] <Kirito> When I change the ID of an element, jQuery doesn't seem to recognize the change in my event listeners. e.g. if I change an element with the id of "ban-user" to "unban-user", clicking the link still triggers the ban-user listener, not unban-user
[20:24:13] <Kirito> What should I be doing to prevent this?
[20:25:47] <FinStick> Kirito: tripple check your selector and refresh browser to load new script properly.
[20:26:31] <Snerf> FinStick, lol.. ok
[20:27:23] <shoky> Kirito: you can use event delegation. e.g. $(document).on('click', '#ban-user', function(){..})
[20:27:49] <Kirito> shoky, Ah, thank you
[20:29:06] <FinStick> if it's stable then just do: $('#ban-user').on('click', function(){...});
[20:36:54] <cratos> Hey guys - any ideas to make the second select

[20:42:51] <gtristan> Can anyone explain why jQuery e.pageX and e.pageY is undefined ?
[20:42:59] <gtristan> in this simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/zedycodx/ ?
[20:43:56] <gtristan> I have my colleague defining unreliable routines for translating clientX to pageX... I was previously using the originalEvent structure but the pageX on the originalEvent is not available on old and crusty IE8
[20:44:33] <gtristan> is there a $(event).wrapThisMuthaFuckaProperly() method I can call to trigger the translation manually ?
[20:53:55] <introspectr3> how much overhead is there when using something like: ("#del-queue-form #queue_id").val()?
[20:54:22] <introspectr3> should i be setting that to a variable and then working on that variable?
[20:55:11] <introspectr3> if(("#del-queue-form #queue_id").val()) { do_something_to(("#del-queue-form #queue_id").val()); }, what cost comes with these two selections?
[20:59:20] <gtristan> looks like I've run into https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1925
[20:59:56] <gtristan> hmmm, closed only 7 days ago
[21:00:16] <gtristan> is it not recommended to grab a bleeding edge jquery I guess ?
[21:00:23] <gtristan> better to wait for a stable release ?
[21:02:03] <gtristan> I guess this is not fixed in 1.11.2 ?
[21:10:17] <gtristan> ok, safest bet, backport https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/5b0b1b77dbc41c144959ef2fe8de603555beb39b into the 1.11.1 that I'm using right now

[22:22:39] <SpinningWheels> why is length 1 and not 10? http://jsbin.com/yequjuxeco/1/
[22:24:38] <Uhkis> because there's only one object
[22:34:40] <SpinningWheels> Uhkis, sorry, my english is not so good, the expectation was that the $("#id") would return a list of matching elements. to me that means it would return every div with an id of '2', why is this not the case?
[22:35:09] <SirLagz> SpinningWheels: there should only ever be one element with an id of 2
