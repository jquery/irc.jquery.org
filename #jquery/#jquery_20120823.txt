[00:09:39] <thomas`-> when i call both .focusin(..) and .blur(..) on an element, .blur is called at the same time as focusin. otherwise, if its on its own it calls when focus is left. whats the deal?? does anyone know why that happens?
[00:11:01] <gloomer> do you have an example thomas`?
[00:13:08] <thomas`-> gloomer, yeah
[00:15:28] <thomas`-> gloomer, the guy who asked this question has same problem as me the code is the same - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4585890/jquery-detecting-when-a-user-clicks-out-of-an-input-type-text-field
[00:15:57] <thomas`-> ill try make something on jsfiddle
[00:18:24] <thomas`-> gloomer, http://jsfiddle.net/fEV6L/
[00:18:40] <thomas`-> or if anyone happens to know why this doesnt work? ^
[00:19:11] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/28czX/3/
[00:20:09] <thomas`-> gloomer, why doesnt mine work then the code is the same
[00:21:22] <thomas`-> that is weird
[00:21:24] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/fEV6L/1/
[00:21:32] <gloomer> the alert is causing you to lose focus
[00:21:44] <gloomer> so you focusin fire alert which causes blur
[00:21:51] <thomas`-> ohh
[00:22:08] <thomas`-> thx gloomer that was making me go insane

[00:40:05] <notafrog> I'm generating an anchor navigation from headings in JavaScript, but I've got one problem. The "active" heading (that is currently on top of the view) should be highlighted in the navigation.
[00:40:26] <notafrog> Any tips on how to achieve this? Some sort of event that triggers when user scrolls a heading into view?
[00:41:08] <blackspotwiggins> notafrog, onscroll ?
[00:41:20] <blackspotwiggins> and check if it's visible within viewport
[00:43:08] <notafrog> blackspotwiggins: I guess that works, how would one check if element is in the viewport and if it's the highest in a set of elements?
[00:45:25] <gloomer> notafrog dimensions scrolltop
[00:50:30] <mazzachre> Can I somehow get the mouse coordinates on a custom event? Or from somewhere in the code that is not event based?
[00:53:16] <Cork> mazzachre: you need to save it in a variable your self
[00:53:34] <Cork> the mouse position isn't provided by the browser beside inside events
[00:55:05] <mazzachre> Cork: Hmmm... Problem is, I need it from a place that is quite deep within the code... And I have not thought about this before... damned
[00:57:25] <gloomer> var xpos = ypos = 0; $().mousemove(function(e) { xpos = e.pageX; ypos = e.pageY; });
[00:57:55] <gloomer> of course thats event based
[00:58:22] <mazzachre> gloomer: But that is expensive... tracking the mouse around like that... Basically I need this in somewhere where I use hoverIntent... And it does not seem to provide?
[00:58:49] <__file__> Hi, what is the best way to find the first parent/grandparent (etc..) of $(this) of a type "form" ?
[00:59:29] <blackspotwiggins> ?closest @ __file__
[00:59:29] <bot-t> __file__, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:02:29] <mazzachre> I have this widget, a tooltip thing (unfortunately none of the existing ones work for what I want) I use hoverIntent to start the trigger, however I use a timed delay and some ajax stuff and I call my render function via a custom event from the results of either of these... And it is inside the render funtion (or a sub call of that called position) that I need the mouse position... But how to store it from the event is triggered?
[01:02:29] <mazzachre> Without using global variables that is...
[01:02:44] <b0bi> Hi, what is the best way to find the first parent/grandparent (etc..) of $(this) of a type "form" ?
[01:02:58] <b0bi> (I was disconnected so I have to ask again, sorry for that)
[01:03:33] <gloomer> b0bi .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:08:20] <gloomer> mazzachre what event starts your widget
[01:08:27] <gloomer> hover?
[01:10:50] <noregret> can someone help with the equalTo rule in the validation plugin ?
[01:12:16] <Cork> mazzachre: $(document).on('mousemove.status', function(event) { window.status = { x: event.clientX, y: eventY } });
[01:12:22] <Cork> mazzachre: that should solve your problem
[01:12:26] <Cork> opps
[01:12:33] <Cork> mazzachre: $(document).on('mousemove.status', function(event) { window.status = { x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY } });
[01:15:50] <mazzachre> Cork: Won't that be very heavy?
[01:16:18] <Cork> mazzachre: its not super light no
[01:16:43] <Cork> it will generate some garbage, but code wise its not heavy
[01:16:58] <Cork> changing the values on the object instead of creating a new one would help
[01:22:01] <gloomer> mazzachre try this http://jsfiddle.net/TFqjR/15/
[01:29:19] <AdvoWork> hi there, if ive got a text area with new lines in etc(ie its a constructed email), and i'm sending to a php page, how do I preserve the new lines, as soon as PHP gets it, its all one line?
[01:29:59] <mazzachre> gloomer: thx.. I will look into that...
[01:43:10] <noregret> can someone help with the equalTo rule in the validation plugin ?
[01:46:07] <gloomer> noregret what do you need help with
[01:48:56] <noregret> gloomer: the two fields just don't match.. even though they do..
[01:49:26] <gloomer> what does your code look like
[01:49:51] <noregret> gloomer: pm
[01:50:21] <noregret> gloomer: the code is in the source
[01:51:54] <pingec> Why if I put the definition of an eventhandler function after the code where I bind it to an element (via jQuery), firefox throws "ReferenceError: function is not defined"?
[01:52:16] <pingec> If I put the definition before I bind it to an element it's ok. But this problem is only in ff, chrome and IE9 don't seem to care about the order...
[02:01:30] <faraway> pingec: like you said .. you define it after you bind it
[02:19:16] <skamikaze> o/
[02:20:23] <skamikaze> got a question on css3d translations: how would I manage the animation state? E.g. stopping an animation and jump to end (like jQuery $.stop(true, true))
[02:21:48] <blackspotwiggins> skamikaze, you cant
[02:22:11] <blackspotwiggins> well maybe remove the animation css properties would work
[02:26:01] <skamikaze> blackspotwiggins: and apply the end state by an additional css class?
[02:26:10] <skamikaze> (doesn't look DRY)
[02:28:13] <skamikaze> ty anyways dude - that was the answer i suspected :P
[02:30:35] <fdv> when append()ing in a loop, nothing actually seems to show until the loop has run through (chrome, linux). If I use recursive calls to setTimeout() (with 0ms timeout), the DOM is updated in each iteration (presumably as control is relieved).
[02:31:37] <fdv> can anybody point to an article or other resource describing how DOM insertions are handled?
[02:31:47] <bytephilia> Crop image with jQuery possible? Don't want a UI plugin, just a script to crop an image to specific width & height.
[02:34:03] <skamikaze> bytephilia: http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html
[02:35:06] <gloomer> or just use css
[02:35:11] <gloomer> for a faux crop

[02:50:28] <sjeijk> how to get the parents div id from a button I pressed .. from out a plugin :s
[02:51:02] <sjeijk> trying to do something like $(this).parent().attr('id')
[02:52:07] <sjeijk> but that returns undefined
[02:53:50] <sjeijk> and returns [] when i do $(this).parent()
[02:54:40] <Clex> sjeijk: what does $(this).html() returns?
[02:55:16] <sjeijk> null
[02:55:55] <Clex> It seemns that it's not a DOM object, but it has the jQuery methods, weird.
[02:56:31] <sjeijk> well considering my jquery hack and slash force to get stuff working the spaghetti way I'm not surprised :)
[02:57:43] <shoky> sjeijk: console.log(this, $(this).parent())
[02:57:56] <shoky> are they the elements you expect them to be
[02:58:16] <sjeijk> returns []
[02:58:17] <squeakytoy> quick question, how do i get the "inner" element from a jquery element? jquery elements usually wrap a "real" element, how to access that?
[02:58:30] <sjeijk> o wait
[02:58:34] <shoky> sjeijk: and 'this' ?
[02:59:16] <sjeijk> console.log(this, $(this).parent()) gives back an object
[02:59:27] <shoky> squeakytoy: you can get the first element with [0] e.g.  $('#yo')[0]
[02:59:49] <shoky> sjeijk: what object
[03:00:20] <sjeijk> actually I'm using a form wizard plugin
[03:00:32] <sjeijk> i get that object afaik
[03:00:38] <squeakytoy> ok thanks
[03:00:50] <shoky> sjeijk: not enough info to help you..
[03:01:34] <sjeijk> I'm getting this back http://pastebin.com/rfTsdNv4 shoky
[03:02:01] <shoky> where are you running this in
[03:02:13] <shoky> thought it's a click handler on a button
[03:02:50] <sjeijk> ah ok, sry for my poor understanding of jq so far.. let me try to explain
[03:03:03] <webdev> hello all.
[03:04:08] <sjeijk> I have a form and bind the formwizard plugin to it, that finds the submit buttons within that form and binds some functionalty to it
[03:05:00] <sjeijk> I need to find out which button is pressed (I have 3) so I want to find it's ID or better would be its parents ID
[03:05:29] <sjeijk> because my code is so messy that the ID of the button itself is a mess
[03:06:59] <shoky> what do the buttons do
[03:07:46] <sjeijk> they start the wizard and get to next steps in the wizard
[03:08:30] <shoky> the plugin handles all 3?
[03:09:00] <shoky> what are you trying to do..
[03:09:15] <ukkopekka> I've got problems with dc mega menu z-index (using it with UI layout plugin). Have you faced similar problems? Is there any better menu plugin?
[03:09:56] <gloomer> $(selector).parent().attr('id')
[03:11:01] <sjeijk> well I'm trying to put the value of the buttons parent ID in a variable to use that to select the divcolumn to put in the new results
[03:11:25] <sjeijk> but basically store value in var
[03:12:11] <sjeijk> but I'm not sure if thats possible from out the plugin, as I'm quiet new to jq
[03:12:28] <shoky> where are you running this code though.. where did you put $(this).parent() etc.. ?
[03:12:51] <sjeijk> its in jquery.form.wizard.js
[03:12:58] <shoky> you're modifying the plugin?
[03:13:05] <sjeijk> yes
[03:13:07] <shoky> gah.
[03:13:21] <shoky> if you're new to jq, that is the last thing you should be doing
[03:13:26] <shoky> start over, now.
[03:13:27] <shoky> :)
[03:13:31] <sjeijk> :p
[03:13:37] <gloomer> he will learn quick
[03:14:00] <shoky> if you want to learn from the plugin, learn its code, understand every bit of it
[03:14:09] <shoky> dont modify it till then..
[03:14:24] <sjeijk> actually I understand what it does…
[03:14:27] <xec> shoky++
[03:14:43] <shoky> sjeijk that's hardly the same as understanding its code
[03:14:50] <shoky> hey xec ;]
[03:14:51] <sjeijk> true
[03:15:04] <sjeijk> learning fast
[03:15:42] <xec> heya :)
[03:15:49] <se-lite_> Does jquery/xhr have any ways to know which of 2 request was sent first? Or do people have good ways of knowing tracking that to make sure the last request get received last?
[03:15:53] <shoky> whatup homeboy
[03:16:18] <xec> just hanging around, spying on conversations and awarding karmapoints for simple truths ;)
[03:16:30] <shoky> good on ya ;p
[03:26:10] <Koopz> hmm...im trying to get my autocomplete with remote datasource to work...but somehow the result list doesn't show up
[03:26:30] <gloomer> code?
[03:29:05] <shoky> overrated
[03:29:28] <Koopz> eeyup...
[03:29:35] <nFFF> $('img[name='+$(this).attr('name'))  // $(this).attr('name') == 'shoe'
[03:29:44] <nFFF> this is a vlid selector right guise?
[03:29:54] <nFFF> will select <div name="shoe">
[03:30:29] <johnkpaul> noregret: no, that will only select images
[03:30:33] <johnkpaul> nFFF: ^
[03:30:59] <nFFF> siorry <img name-"shoe">
[03:31:13] <shoky> and you need to close the ]
[03:31:29] <nFFF> thats the one
[03:31:30] <nFFF> :D
[03:32:10] <sjeijk> shoky I was wondering if when I bind the submit button on click at doc ready then will the bind in the plugin overwrite its functionality?
[03:32:35] <Vikash> In Jquery autocomplete how to use arrow keys to select and not use mouse
[03:33:15] <Vikash> In Jquery autocomplete how to use arrow keys to select and not use mouse
[03:33:16] <Vikash> In Jquery autocomplete how to use arrow keys to select and not use mouse
[03:33:32] <shoky> sjeijk: i donno what the plugin does.. but it probably doesnt overwrite any click event handlers, only form submits
[03:33:52] <shoky> Vikash: with the arrow keys
[03:34:04] <shoky> Vikash: and not use mouse
[03:34:26] <shoky> x3
[03:35:09] <Vikash> currenly the dropdown list that shows the options has to be selected using a mouse unlike in google one can use down arrows to select the options
[03:35:24] <shoky> Vikash: works for me with the arrow keys
[03:35:44] <shoky> oh.
[03:35:52] <Vikash> Hi shoky...arrow keys are not working for me on chrome
[03:36:13] <shoky> mm working for me.. here http://jsfiddle.net/BLnXB/
[03:37:49] <Vikash> I will try that now
[03:38:04] <shoky> also working for me here.. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[03:38:30] <gloomer> works for me in chrome as well
[03:39:12] <shoky> Vikash: and if you put minLength: 0  then it'd work when the input is empty as well..
[03:42:17] <Vikash> yes...i saw...maybe i am using wrong JS and CSS files...let me download fresh ones from jquery
[04:05:40] <Vikash> Hi shoky....I have done it with updated files
[04:05:49] <Vikash> thanks for your support
[04:26:58] <wingy> how do you make http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/ work in mobile as well?
[04:28:07] <Cork> ?g jquery ui touch punch @ wingy
[04:28:09] <bot-t> wingy, jQuery UI Touch Punch - Touch Event Support for jQuery UI - http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[04:29:58] <wingy> Cork: ill look into it
[04:30:01] <wingy> what about http://www.jqtouch.com/ ?
[04:30:44] <Cork> wingy: looks too webkit focused
[04:31:00] <wingy> Cork: it works for Android as well
[04:31:13] <wingy> but then you have to map it yourself i think
[04:31:13] <Cork> well "it happens to work"
[04:31:25] <Cork> but they even state "test in webkit"
[04:31:54] <Cork> touch punch just addes the missing touch events to the normal jquery ui
[04:32:14] <Cork> it doesn't change anything else
[04:34:48] <wingy> ok
[04:35:17] <wingy> are you using jQuery UI and Touch Punch to make it work in phones/tablets?
[04:36:38] <wingy> wow .. worked like a charm!
[04:36:49] <Cork> i use it for sliders yes
[04:37:01] <Cork> i only use the slider from the ui packages
[04:37:09] <Cork> so donno how much it helps for the rest
[04:37:27] <wingy> me 2 :)
[04:37:46] <wingy> jQuery UI should make it work for all envs by default
[04:37:46] <Cork> i looked for it cause i wanted a minimalistic fix
[04:37:51] <Cork> yes
[04:38:01] <Cork> and if you check the plugin its really simple too
[04:40:00] <wingy> yesterday i thought about using jQuery mobile for sliders
[04:40:26] <Cork> eeh, i don't really like how much mobile messes with the page
[04:40:42] <Cork> so i don't use it
[04:40:51] <wingy> if there is someway to just use the slider
[04:41:11] <Cork> don't think there is
[04:41:11] <wingy> im using angular in frontend
[04:41:18] <wingy> yeah
[04:41:22] <wingy> too bloated then
[04:41:30] <wingy> really happy with the quick fix
[04:41:30] <Cork> jquery ui is really simple to style to what ever you want so...
[04:41:50] <wingy> Cork: do you have more good stuff for frontend to share?
[04:42:12] <wingy> im using angular+bootstrap+jqueryui for the frontend
[04:42:23] <wingy> you can't post issues in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[04:42:27] <wingy> :(
[04:42:46] <Cork> well this is built ontop of a ror site with jqote2 jquery and jquery ui
[04:42:56] <Cork> and some libs i've wroten my self
[04:43:00] <Cork> written*
[04:43:35] <jita> How do i change the action of the form before submitting it ?
[04:43:40] <jita> can i do it in one line ?
[04:43:53] <Cork> $('form').attr('action', 'new-action')
[04:48:06] <jita> Cork, then i have to explicitly submit it ?
[04:48:27] <jita> Cork, the javascript command this.form.action(new_action) changes the action and submits it immediately
[04:48:29] <Cork> depends on what your going
[04:48:32] <milligan> Is this a valid JSON object: ["{\u0027chatter\u0027:\u0027milligan\u0027,\u0027chat_text\u0027:\u0027Hey! This is a test :)\u0027}"] <- If so, how can I "parse" the object so I can do obj.chatter .. ?
[04:48:34] <jita> i though there might be something equivalent
[04:48:40] <jita> thought*
[04:49:11] <Cork> milligan: you have an array with a string in it, the string contains escaped json
[04:49:30] <milligan> Cork, I pretty much want to return an array of objects that contain the two strings.
[04:49:36] <Cork> JSON.parse('["{\u0027chatter\u0027:\u0027milligan\u0027,\u0027chat_text\u0027:\u0027Hey! This is a test :)\u0027}"]')[0]

[04:58:24] <johanhar> hmm that gave me the form it self...
[04:58:26] <johanhar> damn :P
[04:59:39] <Cork> johanhar: gecko has explicitOriginalTarget
[04:59:59] <Cork> but it doesn't appear to exist in the other engines so no luck

[05:01:29] <johanhar> Ah, ok thanks Cork :)
[05:03:41] <milligan> Cork, ["{\"chatter\":\"milligan\",\"chat_text\":\"Hey! This is a test :)\"}"] <- valid ?
[05:04:06] <Cork> yes but you have an additional string thats not needed
[05:04:17] <Cork> [{"chatter":"milligan","chat_text":"Hey! This is a test :)"}] <--
[05:04:30] <milligan> ?eval JSON.parse('["{\"chatter\":\"milligan\",\"chat_text\":\"Hey! This is a test :)\"}"]')[0]

[05:04:47] * Cork pokes bot-t 
[05:04:54] <Sicp> http://pastebin.com/Kw1q5phy -- is line 16 correct? that query statement above at line 2 should be returning only 1 row
[05:04:57] <Cork> its dead...
[05:05:03] <Sicp> is that how I access a field in that row?
[05:05:24] <Pitel_laptop> jQuery can't change object width, if it's set in css file with !important. Is this ok?
[05:05:28] <milligan> Cork, I'm pretty much trying to generate this in a jsp. LEt me pastebin my code.
[05:05:41] <Cork> Pitel_laptop: thats how css works
[05:06:02] <Cork> Pitel_laptop: no way around that except -- DON't USE !important
[05:06:08] <milligan> Cork, http://pastebin.com/gTDhZrCm . How would I better be putting the data into a json ?
[05:06:13] <Pitel_laptop> Cork: ok
[05:06:21] <EdwardIII> hrm got a bit of an odd one: jquery mobile. i create a nav toggle button, but when i switch between pages the event somehow isn't getting bound: https://gist.github.com/3436039
[05:07:07] <EdwardIII> my nav elem is in the header... not sure if the header gets redrawn?
[05:07:14] <EdwardIII> anyway i figure it shouldn't matter
[05:07:23] <Cork> milligan: .net?
[05:07:25] <Cork> or java?
[05:07:29] <milligan> Cork, java
[05:09:10] <Cork> milligan: my java knowledge isn't too grate, but if i remember correctly you create an ObjectMapper for the js objects
[05:09:29] <Cork> so you want an array of object maps and convert that to json
[05:10:21] <milligan> Cork, I think I might have fixed it .. :)
[05:11:06] <milligan> yep - fixed. :D
[05:11:11] <Cork> nice :)
[05:13:30] <Sicp> any idea?
[05:13:36] <Sicp> link above, line 16?
[05:14:18] <Cork> Sicp: you using localStorage or what?
[05:14:26] <Sicp> Phonegap's Storage
[05:14:30] <Sicp> their docs are shit
[05:14:42] <Cork> never heard of it sorry
[05:14:42] <NodeX> LOL
[05:14:47] <Sicp> I am new to JS/jQuery as a whole too
[05:14:57] <NodeX> what's wrong with the localstorage docs?
[05:15:02] <NodeX> (phonegap)
[05:15:28] <Sicp> I can't find what I want in them; ergo, shit
[05:15:29] <Sicp> :P
[05:16:04] <NodeX> what do you need to know, I have just wrote an app using it
[05:16:10] <NodeX> perhaps I can help
[05:16:22] <Sicp> the link is here, http://pastebin.com/Kw1q5phy
[05:16:48] <Sicp> line 16 is where I think things are going wrong. That query is supposed to return 1 row, and in that row I want to check for 1 field if it contains some value
[05:16:52] <Sicp> if it does, etc.....
[05:17:17] <NodeX> have you checked there is actually results?
[05:17:23] <Sicp> the means of accessing the results array is what I want to know..what am I accessing when I say "results.row.item(int)" and what am I accessing when I say "results.row.item(int).something"
[05:17:33] <Sicp> yes, for the first time there aren't any, I know that
[05:17:50] <Sicp> but I don't know what I'm supposed to be getting in the first place, with that code in place
[05:18:44] <NodeX> http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.2.0/phonegap_storage_storage.md.html#SQLResultSet
[05:19:01] <NodeX> looking at your vars I assume you followed that already?
[05:19:22] <Sicp> yes
[05:19:38] <wingy> i want an element to first be replaced with a div then that div will have some children by append() : $(el).html('<div></div>').append('<span></span>') doesn't give me what i want since the div and the span are siblings .. how do i make the span a child of div?
[05:20:51] <Sicp> what about this, NodeX, http://pastebin.com/fAwy3ead is that correct? I leave out the first field (purchase ID) from thte insertion so it can automatically increment?
[05:20:54] <wingy> Cork: https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch/issues/47#issuecomment-7967263
[05:22:42] <Cork> wingy: expected as much
[05:22:59] <NodeX> Sicp : it's been a while since Iv'e used anything SQL related but doesn't sqllite NOT have auto incrementing fields
[05:23:28] <Sicp> I noticed from other examples of that code yes, they insert manually
[05:24:26] <NodeX> Gimme a min Sicp : my head hurts !
[05:24:31] <Sicp> ok man
[05:24:52] <lenswipee> what's min sicp?
[05:25:38] <NodeX> "minute"
[05:27:38] <Sicp> lol lenswipee
[05:27:46] <Sicp> he thought it was a minimum value of something
[05:29:48] <Sicp> what about this then, this is nothing, just fucking quotations I can't ...master them yet
[05:29:49] <Sicp> http://pastebin.com/1p8ExZQ2
[05:29:58] <Sicp> what closes and what opens and why double instead of single!
[05:30:55] <Croves> Hello #jquery!
[05:38:51] <EdwardIII> NodeX.js?
[05:41:48] <shadykhan> the correct syntax for selecting a third element is $('div[2]') or am i thinking of something else?
[05:44:55] <jsmonkey> thank god it was years since I touched sql. a little piece of me dies when I read that ugly syntax :)
[05:50:06] <Cork> shadykhan: yes its :eq(2)
[05:50:19] <j2000> hi
[05:50:49] <j2000> anyone used jquery-pjax? i was wondering if anyone had found a workaround for executing javascript from the loaded fragment
[05:50:59] <Cork> shadykhan: but your really better of running that outside the selector
[05:51:18] <Cork> $('div').eq(2)
[05:53:10] <Wolf_22> How do you create an element in jQuery before another element? Is this done with before() or insertBefore()?
[05:53:42] <Zogot> prepend?
[05:53:50] <ak> both should work
[05:56:29] <Croves> How do I check if a string is empty?
[05:57:22] <xbuzz> if (var === "") { // true }
[05:57:23] <Zogot> .length
[05:57:32] <xbuzz> or .length :)
[05:58:11] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Croves: someString === ''        or simply    if (!someString)     however that will also return true for any boolean set to false or anything with a null or undefined value
[05:58:31] <Croves> Uow! Thanks guys... but why should I use '===' instead of '==' ?
[05:58:43] <xbuzz> === is a type check
[05:59:05] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Croves: if (1 == '1') //True          if (1 === '1') //False          if (1 === 1) //True      if ('1' === '1') //True
[05:59:07] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Hey, I'm curious as to why "(new Date).getTime();" is returning a 13 digit number yet Linux's date program returns a 10 digit epoch with 'date +%s'  Anybody know what's going on here?
[05:59:33] <Croves> Oh, now I get it
[05:59:36] <Croves> Thanks DeltaHeavy|Work
[05:59:49] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Carves: No problem
[06:00:54] <Croves> Just one more question...
[06:01:08] <Croves> http://pastebin.com/kSMKwCgi
[06:01:59] <Zogot> Croves, if its a form you can just use .serialize()
[06:02:05] <Croves> If I put a value in my textbox (something like 'ABC'), I'll get the alert('hi'), but also I'll get the seccond alert, from success
[06:02:05] <Zogot> instead of getting the values for each input
[06:02:11] <james_morrin> So I am a little bummed out that we won't have a jQuery Boston Conference this year :(
[06:02:40] <xbuzz> line 17 missing closing )
[06:02:57] <xbuzz> oh sorry it's on the next line ;)
[06:03:35] <xbuzz> success means that AJAX completed
[06:04:16] <Zogot> Croves, you will have an easier time if you build this progressively.  You can then avoid the validation checks in javascript and have the ajax respond with whats wrong with the input (too short, missing etc)
[06:04:17] <xbuzz> beforeSend simply performs some action prior to making the request.
[06:05:24] <Croves> Right... so if I wanna a loading GIF when the user submit the form, it must be in the beforeSend?
[06:05:50] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Anybody know where else I can take my epoch problem?
[06:06:29] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Already tried ##javascript. Was my first place
[06:08:57] <james_morrin> 99 problems and epoch is one
[06:10:30] <DeltaHeavy|Work> HIT MEH
[06:10:42] <Croves> LOL
[06:11:24] <djaxk> 'n afternono
[06:12:42] <pachet> afternono : (n) an afternoon pasttime you know you shouldn't be doing, eg smoking behind the elementary school
[06:14:41] <djaxk> Question: is triggerHandler(...) supposed to trigger ALL the bound handlers?
[06:22:39] <keyword> hi guys I have a question I need send basic auth in the ajax call I made this but doesnt works http://pastie.org/private/exlx6lg4dcetqhsb38k0lq
[06:23:18] <ParanoidGal> Hi guys is there a simple way to make the dropdown under the Forearm Dance menu option to open once hovered on? http://www.valguin.com/redesign/
[06:29:43] <djaxk> Does anyone knows why trigger(Handler) does not trigger all the bound events?
[06:30:30] <pachet> hrm, sounds odd. can you demonstrate this in a fiddle?
[06:45:56] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: one is in seconds, the other in milliseconds
[06:46:41] <DeltaHeavy|Work> shoky: Yes, I see that now :p Thanks though!
[06:46:58] <mekwall> djaxk, what does .data("events") say?
[06:50:03] <bitglue> i have a question about deferred objects: is there a way I can implement a function which processes the result of a deferred action (say, ajax request) and potentially changes success into failure? For example, what if I wanted to implement a login() function that calls $.ajax(), then inspects the response to see if the credentials were accepted?
[06:50:29] <j2000> anyone used jquery-pjax? i was wondering if anyone had found a workaround for executing javascript from the loaded fragment?
[06:51:05] <shoky> bitglue: if you want you can set up your own defferred.  var dfd = $.Deferred();   then .resolve() it exactly when you want to
[06:51:49] <shoky> or .reject() it, of course
[06:52:11] <bitglue> makes since, but seems quite inconvienent for a pretty common case
[06:52:33] <shoky> why do you need the success to change into a failure?
[06:52:46] <shoky> doesnt seem like a common case to me
[06:53:03] <shoky> success for the ajax request means the ajax request was successful
[06:53:18] <bitglue> shoky: ok, and what if the server successfuly responds, "invalid credentials"?
[06:53:24] <bitglue> that's a failure
[06:53:29] <shoky> then you'd respond to that, however you want
[06:53:41] <shoky> can't get more convenient than that
[06:54:17] <bitglue> shoky: but if i'm implementing a function login(), it doesn't make much sense for "invalid credentials" to be considered "success"
[06:54:21] <sjeijk> do any of you (mac users) prefer safari console to debug instead of firebug?
[06:54:44] <shoky> bitglue: it makes all the sense in the world that the ajax request is considered "success"
[06:54:56] <bitglue> shoky: but we aren't talking about an ajax request. we are talking about login().
[06:55:02] <Jon47> sjeijk: i prefer the chrome dev tools, which are based on the same webkit debugger that safari is
[06:55:11] <shoky> bitglue: you were talking about an ajax request
[06:55:19] <shoky> bitglue: and changing its success to fail..
[06:55:21] <bitglue> shoky: the fact that login() is an ajax request is totally irrelevant to the thing calling login().
[06:55:36] <shoky> bitglue: that's why login can returned a deferred (or a promise)
[06:55:51] <shoky> bitglue: a new deferred, representing the login status (NOT the ajax request)
[06:55:58] <bitglue> shoky: right, but now i have to go through all this boilerplate of creating a new deferred.
[06:56:22] <bitglue> i also have to add boilerplate to make sure that if the ajax request fails, then my deferred fails, too.
[06:56:26] <sjeijk> i like the looks of safari a bit more jon47 but not sure if it has the same functionality
[06:56:52] <Jon47> sjeijk:  what are you missing?  I bet you'll find that it has everything you need
[06:57:12] <bitglue> shoky: have you ever used twisted?
[06:57:40] <shoky> bitglue: no
[06:57:47] <Palanivel> Gud evening friends..........i done some animation here...see this link  http://jsfiddle.net/p8LxR/6/  ............here that div is continuously blinking...but i dont know how to do the smooth animation like sea water flowing.....................any one have idea about this please help me
[06:57:48] <sjeijk> I'm not sure where i can set a watch jon47
[06:57:54] <sjeijk> watcher
[06:58:04] <bitglue> shoky: give this a read: http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html
[06:58:14] <Jon47> sjelik: In Chrome it's in the Sources tab
[06:58:55] <Jon47> the latest version of safari changed the UI quite a bit so i'm not sure where to find stuff anymore
[06:59:12] <shoky> bitglue: that is indeed, twisted. jquery'd deferred are not twisted, sry
[06:59:26] <bitglue> shoky: well obviously. maybe you'd learn something new.
[06:59:30] <sjeijk> same here, took me some time to find everything
[06:59:49] <shoky> bitglue: i learned that stuff can get twisted if you wanna twist them. actually i already knew that ;]
[06:59:56] <shoky> bitglue: j/k. thanks for the link :P
[07:01:34] <bitglue> shoky: i think the significant difference is that in twisted, if you add callback a, then callback b, callback b gets whatever a returned, instead of the same thing callback a got. Also, if a callback raises an exception, then processing switches over to the "failure" callbacks, which can then not raise exceptions, and move processing back to the "success" callbacks. It maps more cleanly to the pattern of synchronous code raising and catching exceptions.
[07:03:04] <bitglue> shoky: it's also interesting to note that while almost *everything* in twisted uses a deferred, there are just a few places that typically need to create them, because it's trivial to chain them together and mutate the result of a deferred you got from something else into whatever result (success or not) you need.
[07:03:41] <ajpiano> bitglue: there is see ?Deferred.pipe

[07:15:05] <pangelovski> hi guys, I'm doing a asyn call to a rest and getting the data. however i need to create a event listener and and then trigger event when the data is ready for processing, how can i achieve this with query?
[07:15:48] <MaxymiserTE> that will remove the styling. i just want to count the words while keeping the styling
[07:16:33] <shoky> ?$.get @ pangelovski
[07:16:34] <bot-t> pangelovski, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[07:17:16] <blackspotwiggins> MaxymiserTE, what the hell man. styling does not change the amount of words
[07:17:18] <pangelovski> shoky: is this the same as $.getJson
[07:17:53] <shoky> pangelovski: pretty much, except for the obvious difference
[07:17:54] <MrDup> Hi all
[07:17:55] <MaxymiserTE> well i have 29 words and its only counting 26
[07:18:00] <pangelovski> :)
[07:18:01] <MaxymiserTE> and have 3 tags in it
[07:18:35] <MaxymiserTE> my function is counting the styling as a 'word'
[07:18:35] <shoky> count the words while keeping the styling, huh?
[07:18:39] <pangelovski> shoky: i have done this but still get a undefined data
[07:18:40] <MrDup> I need a quick tip : What's the easiest way to test if a jquery selection return at least 1 item ?
[07:19:07] <shoky> pangelovski: what is your server returning..
[07:19:16] <pangelovski> let me show you
[07:19:22] <shoky> MrDup: .length
[07:19:37] <pangelovski> http://pastebin.com/eedze1bN
[07:19:41] <MrDup> shoky: does it return the number of items selected ?
[07:19:47] <shoky> MrDup: yup
[07:20:01] <MrDup> Thanks a lot dude
[07:20:22] <blackspotwiggins> ?p @ MaxymiserTE
[07:20:22] <bot-t> MaxymiserTE, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:20:34] <pangelovski> shoky: i have a success function inside the getJson that should return the data object to the GetLanguages function but the var languages is udefined
[07:20:35] <shoky> pangelovski: you cant return the data from inside your success callback. do what you need to do with it there
[07:20:42] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ pangelovski
[07:20:42] <bot-t> pangelovski, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[07:20:48] <blackspotwiggins> beat me to it shoky
[07:20:55] <shoky> ;p
[07:21:36] <pangelovski> so if i want to get the data and create a button i should do it inside the callback?
[07:21:48] <shoky> yes
[07:23:02] <Anticom2> hi all
[07:23:04] <shoky> pangelovski: if you wa.done(function(data) {

[07:23:04] <shoky>     }).error(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {

[07:23:13] <shoky> sorry ;D
[07:23:16] <pangelovski> whaat??? :)

[07:26:17] <Mento> hey guys, any idea how i can animate a set of numbers? my value is 2891 and i want to animate it from 0 to 2891 - like it keeps counting until it reaches the final value
[07:26:18] <xec> quiznilo: maybe you want .append("<li>") ?
[07:26:30] <blackspotwiggins> Mento, for loop maybe?
[07:26:48] <quiznilo> perhaps, but I read to .append('li') on the nets, and they're never wrong
[07:27:12] <xec> quiznilo: the nets is a reliable source indeed
[07:27:16] <quiznilo> hehe
[07:28:07] <quiznilo> didn't work... something else is up, researching

[07:28:50] <bitglue> is there any difference between someDeferred.then(a, b) and someDeferred.done(a); someDeferred.fail(b)?
[07:28:55] <marcogmonteiro> is it possible to change that last segment of the url with query?

[07:34:03] <xdjuj__> find() ?
[07:34:18] <bitglue> so if i want to chain just the failure case of deferred a to deferred b, would a.fail(b.reject.bind(b)) be the way to do that?
[07:34:25] <Croves> In JS I must use { } in a one-line IF statement? Like if (data.resp == false) { alert('false'); }
[07:34:35] <xdjuj__> What actually is the better Responsive Slider ?
[07:34:41] <xdjuj__> -better +best
[07:34:43] <Croves> Or I can do this: if (data.resp == false) alert('false')
[07:35:00] <shoky> Croves: you can do either
[07:35:30] <xec> MrDup: as in "myclass" can be part of a classname, or one of the classnames?
[07:35:46] <shoky> bitglue: that looks right to me
[07:36:09] <MrDup> xec: a part of a classname
[07:36:10] <egydes> so what?
[07:36:30] <bitglue> shoky: i think it's mostly that functionality (which just happens by default) that i miss from twisted's deferreds
[07:36:30] <egydes> what the best resource to learn jquery
[07:36:51] <MrDup> actually, I need a "start with" syntaxe, but if I know for "contains", it will be fine. =)
[07:36:54] <xec> MrDup: then you could use the attribute contains selector: [class*="myclass"]
[07:37:38] <egydes> what the best resource to learn jquery
[07:37:40] <MrDup> So, attribute selector works with any attributes into the tag ?
[07:37:56] <shoky> ?learn @ egydes
[07:37:56] <bot-t> egydes, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[07:38:08] <xec> lol, he had to leave of course :)
[07:38:18] <shoky> ;<
[07:38:31] <bitglue> so, what happens if i give a doneFilter to deferred.pipe() which returns a deferred that has been rejected? Is the new deferred returned by pipe then also rejected?
[07:38:43] <MrDup> xec ?
[07:38:58] <shoky> bitglue: think so, not 100% sure
[07:39:34] <shoky> MrDup it work with every attribute yea
[07:39:42] <xec> MrDup: i was talking about egydes. if you didn't understand my previous reply you can have a look here: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[07:41:15] <MrDup> xec: I did, I asked a second thing but shoky just answered it. Thanks guys. ;)
[07:41:26] <xec> ah, i missed that
[07:41:41] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Anybody know how I can make this work? Pretty self explanatory and trivial: http://jsfiddle.net/Hqtj4/
[07:42:00] <DeltaHeavy|Work> 2 Lines of JS and 1 HTML input element
[07:42:09] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: include jquery?
[07:42:44] <DeltaHeavy|Work> shoky: ...shit T_T Thanks! Now I need to figure out why this isn't working in my script
[07:42:54] <shoky> ;p
[07:48:18] <sk3pt1c> hello, i have this script for facebook sharing: function fbs_click() {u=location.href;t=document.title;window.open('http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u='+encodeURIComponent(u)+'&t='+encodeURIComponent(t),'sharer','toolbar=0,status=0,width=626,height=436');return false;} and instead of reading the current page, it reads the top level index page, any ideas?
[07:49:47] <sk3pt1c> even when i give it the explicit url, it still behaves the same
[07:49:55] <sk3pt1c> any thoughts?
[07:50:03] <jedahan> is there a better way to turn a definition list into a javascript object than `object[$($('dt')[i]).text()] = $(v).text() for v,i in $('dd')`
[07:50:05] <sk3pt1c> it works fine with other sites btw
[07:50:05] <Croves> Hey guys.. I'm having a litle trouble here with my form and ajax jquery
[07:50:11] <Croves> http://pastebin.com/0D89iS2p
[07:51:04] <Croves> When I click in the submit button, the div#formErrors fade in normally. But if I click in the button to close this div, when I click in the submit button again, the div won't appear
[07:51:09] <Croves> I'll need to refresh the page
[07:52:27] <Grundell> I just want to say thank you to every one that has helped me out with my last project "Lost in translation agency" We have now "pre-released" it and this is what it looks like http://www.copypanthers.com/lost-in-translation-agency
[07:52:51] <Grundell> wouldn't make it with out you guys!
[07:53:04] <quiznilo> looks sharp
[07:53:09] <sk3pt1c> could there be something on the page that's not letting facebook read it properly? anyone?
[08:16:20] <saml> how can I find an element with name="hey"  ?
[08:16:31] <saml> jq.find('name=[hey]') ?
[08:16:39] <saml> let me read up
[08:16:50] <Brodingo> saml wrap the braces around everything
[08:17:04] <Brodingo> 'inside the quotes
[08:17:13] <saml> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[08:17:25] <Brodingo> ayup
[08:19:17] <sendoushi> hey guys my jquery isnt working
[08:19:27] <Brodingo> oh no!!!!!!
[08:19:35] <sendoushi> here is the thing. using wordpress, loaded from the wordpress library
[08:19:52] <sendoushi> and made something simple like $j("body").css("border", "1px solid aqua");
[08:19:58] <sendoushi> $j is jquery no conflict
[08:24:05] <jshannon> hi all. i'm using a plugin (roundabout) that resizes a div. As the div is resizing, the text jumps around. see the slider/carousel at http://filmetrics.lerteco.com/ . Also, something similar happens on the demo for the jquery ui effect. The plugin also resizes the div's font-size. I put all sizes (including margins) in em's, which helps, but there's still some text-jumping. Any ideas?
[08:27:15] <sendoushi> alert(document.getElementById("logo")); this retrieves null! this is pretty strange!!
[08:36:17] <leotr> hi! if i set tolerance option to 'pointer', then how can i get mouse pointer coordinates when draggable is dropped
[08:40:09] <pppaul> hey jqueriers
[08:40:12] <derekpioneer> i have an underscore template var myTmp = _.template('<div class="meh"></div>')
[08:40:24] <derekpioneer> i want to do something like myTmp.find('.meh').append('blah')
[08:40:38] <pppaul> i want to do something like $('mydiv').filter('[myattr]')
[08:40:41] <derekpioneer> but i get underscore has no method find
[08:40:55] <derekpioneer> how do i do something like what i'm talking about?
[08:41:08] <derekpioneer> where i can append to html that is only active in a variable
[08:41:16] <pppaul> i see that the attr selectors in the documentation don't mention this
[08:41:22] <pppaul> they talk about selecting a value
[08:41:32] <kamo> Why is this preferred:
[08:41:32] <kamo> $(.mydiv td.data)
[08:41:32] <kamo> Over this:
[08:41:32] <kamo> $(div.myDiv .data)
[08:41:43] <pppaul> oh, my code works with find
[08:43:31] <pppaul> i want to turn my jquery selection (array) into a normal array
[08:43:36] <pppaul> or into a string
[08:45:54] <pangelovski> hi guys in javascript we have this. what is the equivalent in jquery
[08:46:23] <pangelovski> or to rephrase is. is this.name the same as $(this).name in query?
[08:46:50] <johnkpaul> pangelovski: is "this" a dom element in your last question?
[08:47:03] <snover> ?jsisjs
[08:47:04] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[08:48:34] <pangelovski> johnkpaul, I'm new to this but i believe it is not, it is an object containing three properties
[08:48:45] <johnkpaul> pangelovski: http://jsfiddle.net/ephdm/
[08:48:54] <johnkpaul> pangelovski: then why are you using the jquery function?
[08:49:01] <johnkpaul> why not just this.propertyname
[08:49:49] <pangelovski> johnkpaul: because i wanted to do it the "JQuery" way :)
[08:50:10] <johnkpaul> wrapping plain javascript objects with jQuery is not the jquery way
[08:50:11] <johnkpaul> ?learn @pangelovski
[08:50:12] <bot-t> pangelovski, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[08:50:18] <johnkpaul> read through that second link
[08:51:34] <EdwardIII> chaps why does my nav break when i change pages? http://edwardiii.co.uk:4321/
[08:51:44] <EdwardIII> couldn't figure out a jsfiddle mock-up as it requires multiple pages etc
[08:51:56] <pangelovski> johnkpaul: thanks i have been looking for a website that had an extensive tutorial :)
[08:52:17] <johnkpaul> pangelovski: no problem, there are many resources out there
[08:53:37] <EdwardIII> it's not binding the event on the second page from what i can see, but i can't for the life of me figure out why the heck not
[08:54:35] <bitglue> so say i have a set of dom elements named "foo", and i want to find all the elements in that set that have an attribute findme="yes". I'd think I'd do $(foo).find('[findme="yes"]'), but I'm turning up with an empty set, I guess because find() searches the decendants of the nodes in the set, but not the nodes in the set themselves. Is that right? Solution?
[08:55:13] <EdwardIII> is there something special about the data-role="header" i'm missing? does it do something weird to the elements inside it after an ajax pageload?
[08:55:54] <pppaul> i'm trying to get my jquery selection to be a string
[08:55:59] <pppaul> so i can use .join
[08:56:09] <pppaul> (array of strings, or whole string is ok)
[08:56:28] <pppaul> i want the tags and everything, not just the innerHTML or text
[08:56:52] <EdwardIII> pppaul: outerHTML?
[08:57:28] <pppaul> says it's not a function in my $.map  on 'this'
[08:58:14] <pppaul> outerHTML no work
[08:58:32] <EdwardIII> what exactly is this?
[08:58:34] <pppaul> hold on, going to paste code
[08:58:37] <EdwardIII> awesome
[08:58:42] <EdwardIII> jsfiddle if you can
[08:58:50] <pppaul> it's 1 line
[08:59:04] <ppppaul> $(user_selected_html).find('[data-font-name]').map(function(){return this.outerHTML()})
[08:59:16] <EdwardIII> ah, outerHTML is an attribute not a function
[08:59:36] <pppaul> sweet!
[08:59:37] <pppaul> :D
[09:01:58] <sunbeam> for some reason my $(".ui-datepicker .ui-datepicker-header .ui-corner-all span").click(function() { } doesn't work
[09:02:06] <sunbeam> for this inline datepicker
[09:02:08] <pppaul> is there group-by in jquery?
[09:02:39] <sunbeam> what should I use? a live functiuon?
[09:03:03] <EdwardIII> heh that's a lot of elements in there sunbeam
[09:03:28] <mikepj> delegate from a base element
[09:03:49] <mikepj> base_element.on('click', your_crazy_long_selector, your function);
[09:04:53] <EdwardIII> mikepj: does that selector look OK to you?
[09:06:27] <mikepj> i try not to judge
[09:06:43] <EdwardIII> haha
[09:06:55] <EdwardIII> i mean it looks like you're saying the span, inside the corner, inside the header, inside the datepicker
[09:07:00] <EdwardIII> which seems an odd place to click
[09:07:10] <Clex> sunbeam: you maybe mean $(".ui-datepicker, .ui-datepicker-header, .ui-corner-all")
[09:07:20] <EdwardIII> that's what i was thinking
[09:07:21] <Clex> Otherwise it means having all those classes.
[09:07:33] <prs> maybe you mean $('input[name=date]').click
[09:07:36] <Clex> Instead of one of those.
[09:08:13] <mikepj> oh i thought maybe it was failing becaus jquery ui hadn't enhanced the markup yet
[09:08:23] <mikepj> v0v
[09:08:30] <EdwardIII> v0v?
[09:08:33] <mikepj> shrug
[09:08:36] <mikepj> sorry
[09:08:51] <EdwardIII> chaps has anyone got a pointer on my jquery issue?
[09:09:35] <EdwardIII> i will beer the genuis that can point me in the right direction
[09:10:57] <sunbeam> Clex: no only a link
[09:11:15] <sunbeam> a link i mean the span
[09:12:21] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: there's a push state plugin that I think might help you
[09:12:55] <EdwardIII> hrm johnkpaul really? i didn't think it was a push state related issue
[09:13:01] <iqchtds> I got a text inside <p> and in that text there are <a> elements. When user click on element script displays <ul> of possibilities (every possibility is <a> wraped in <li>> ) I have now a problem. How to change that <a> inside <p> by cliking possibility in way that changes <a> inside <p>?
[09:13:20] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: do you intend the about link toa ctually navigate to a new page?
[09:13:25] <EdwardIII> iqchtds: difficult to follow, any chance you could mock up a quick jsfiddle?
[09:13:36] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: yep - well, ajax load a new page - it's using jquery mobile
[09:13:44] <iqchtds> EdwardIII: OK, I'll try
[09:13:48] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: that bit works, it's just the nav toggle that's broken
[09:14:13] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: rather, the nav toggle works first time around, then after you ajax navigate to about, the nav toggle breaks
[09:14:47] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: I don't think it's ajax navigating
[09:14:52] <johnkpaul> it's loading a new page
[09:15:25] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: well, it pulls in the contents of the data-role="page" from the 'about' page into the current page and changes the title, right?
[09:15:57] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: that's what it's supposed to do, but it is not in your page
[09:16:18] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: hrm, works for me? i click the link, get the little loading icon, then it loads the contents of the new page
[09:16:37] <EdwardIII> console confirms the XHR load of about.html
[09:18:21] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: not so for you? just loads the about.html normally?
[09:19:14] <johnkpaul> oh, no, you're right EdwardIII, I am mistaken
[09:19:19] <chrislabeard> I'm trying to do a slideshow where the image goes 100% across the browser window, but inside of a div with overflow hidden on so it crops it. Does you guys know of any script that allow me to do that
[09:19:25] <johnkpaul> perhaps it is because you are adding the click evnet twice
[09:19:30] <johnkpaul> so the nav get's toggled twice?
[09:21:20] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: lemme add a check
[09:22:44] <pppaul> i am using find, but i want my selector to match/keep the parents/root nodes too
[09:23:08] <pppaul> what do?
[09:23:20] <pppaul> should i use filter and find?
[09:23:27] <pppaul> and concat them?
[09:23:34] <mikepj> andSelf()
[09:23:43] <pppaul> mikepj fo rme?
[09:23:48] <johnkpaul> ?andself @ pppaul
[09:23:49] <bot-t> pppaul, .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[09:24:01] <mikepj> pppaul: yea
[09:24:09] <pangelovski> anyone know why append is not working ios
[09:24:09] <pppaul> thank you
[09:24:41] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: doesn't seem to do the trick (you'll need to mad ctrl+r, new script): http://edwardiii.co.uk:4321/
[09:25:14] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: move line 16 to line 18
[09:25:33] <johnkpaul> you're not checking for the event handler beinga dded twice, you're chekcing for the nav being clicked twice
[09:27:26] <EdwardIII> man... you're right!
[09:27:39] <EdwardIII> damn, how did i not notice that!
[09:28:01] <EdwardIII> that was one of the first things i concluded when i started on this issue, put a check in, but made the same mistake
[09:28:19] <johnkpaul> :) it happens
[09:28:24] <johnkpaul> glad you got it working
[09:28:35] <EdwardIII> i owe you a beer
[09:28:43] <EdwardIII> fancy a beer-by-paypal?
[09:28:58] <johnkpaul> ha, nah, if you're every in NYC, look me up
[09:29:03] <EdwardIII> haha OK
[09:29:07] <EdwardIII> might be a long wait
[09:29:58] <johnkpaul> that's ok, I'll collect if it happens :)
[09:33:35] <sunbeam> var month_name = $("ui-datepicker-month").html();
[09:33:42] <sunbeam> any idea what can be wrong here?
[09:35:15] <EdwardIII> sunbeam: should be .ui-datepicker-month perhaps?
[09:35:17] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: missing the . before the calss
[09:35:18] <mikepj> sunbeam: missing a '.' before ui-datepicker-month
[09:35:21] <johnkpaul> :)
[09:35:25] <EdwardIII> x3
[09:35:25] <johnkpaul> we're _ON_ it
[09:35:27] <EdwardIII> thrice the power
[09:36:17] <sunbeam> ohhho
[09:36:19] <sunbeam> sorry
[09:37:19] <EdwardIII> hrm wait a minute
[09:37:25] <EdwardIII> trying it again johnkpaul i'm not sure if it is fixed: http://edwardiii.co.uk:4321/
[09:37:52] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: the nav still seems to be hiding from my peering eyes
[09:39:55] <bitglue> is there a selector that selects nodes that don't have a particular attribute defined?
[09:40:26] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: why do you wnat to run that at pagechange?
[09:40:29] <johnkpaul> rather than domready?
[09:41:28] <johnkpaul> bitglue: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/
[09:41:39] <amcsi_work> hello
[09:41:59] <bitglue> johnkpaul: not equal to what?
[09:42:02] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: primiarily because it didn't work with pageinit (the jquery mob. version of domready) - so i figured perhaps as (i think) it's replacing the header with ajax i needed to bind the event again?
[09:42:03] <amcsi_work> how can I do something to an element when its animation is done?
[09:42:10] <amcsi_work> I don't have access to the animation information
[09:42:15] <johnkpaul> whatever attriubuyte you _don't_ want
[09:42:31] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: I don't know that much about jquery mobile, try pageinit
[09:42:36] <bitglue> johnkpaul: but i don't care about the value of the attribute; i care that it's not defined.
[09:42:54] <johnkpaul> bitglue: what is "it" in your sentence?
[09:43:01] <bitglue> johnkpaul: the attribute.
[09:43:02] <johnkpaul> it's not a specific attribute that you _don't_ want dfined?
[09:43:14] <johnkpaul> so use the attribute not equal selector for that specific attribute
[09:43:30] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: i've updated the example with pageinit, but it seems to behave the same: http://edwardiii.co.uk:4321/
[09:43:40] <EdwardIII> pageinit was how i started running this bad boy
[09:43:42] <johnkpaul> amcsi_work: you can add a callback to the .animate() call or you can .animate.then(function(){})
[09:43:44] <johnkpaul> ?animate @ amcsi_work
[09:43:45] <bot-t> amcsi_work, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[09:43:51] <bitglue> johnkpaul: given <foo><foo bar="123"><foo bar="456">, i want only the first foo. Also, not knowing that the other bars are 123 or 456, but could be anything. I want all the foos that don't have bar.
[09:43:55] <johnkpaul> amcsi_work: the callback is the complete parameter
[09:44:21] <bitglue> johnkpaul: actually i want the inverse of that, but i assume there is a not selector
[09:44:57] <johnkpaul> bitglue: $('foo:not([bar])')
[09:45:04] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: hmm, I don't know
[09:45:11] <johnkpaul> can you verify that the handler is not being called at all?
[09:45:33] <amcsi_work> can't I access the animation deferred from the element?
[09:46:54] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: i've added console.logs for the page init and for the click, the page init seems to get called each time, the click - well, as you'd expect it's only happening when the box expands
[09:47:00] <EdwardIII> i.e. not after the page transition
[09:47:14] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: does the page transition re-render #nav?
[09:47:59] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: i don't *think* it does. if, in inspect element, i add a new class (E.g. bungholio), then click a link, bungholio stays there so i guess it isn't re-rendering the header
[09:48:04] <EdwardIII> or i'm misreading inspect element
[09:48:24] <bitglue> johnkpaul: that works, thanks
[09:48:56] <johnkpaul> bitglue: no problem, have fun
[09:49:03] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: hmm, I don't know enough about jq mobile to tell you
[09:49:09] <EdwardIII> i am totally damned confused
[09:49:18] <johnkpaul> I am surprised that there's no domready equivalent for you to use
[09:49:31] <EdwardIII> i've ready every manual page on jquery events and page transitions
[09:49:40] <johnkpaul> amcsi_work: from the element itself? there is the animation queue, but I don't know how to get a deferred from that
[09:49:48] <EdwardIII> i've read dozens of stackoverflow articles on the topic "stuff not working after page init"
[09:49:55] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: well the docs say 'pageinit' is the equivalent of domready
[09:50:22] <EdwardIII> "Important: Use $(document).bind('pageinit'), not $(document).ready()": http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[09:50:31] <EdwardIII> but it just really doesn't seem to be working how i expect heh
[09:50:46] <EdwardIII> perhaps one thing to note is that the class does stay 'open' after the page transition
[09:51:10] <johnkpaul> ah, so it doesn't toggle back, even though it's now closed?
[09:51:13] <pangelovski> hi guys, I'm having some issues with this code http://pastebin.com/QTKC4ZZT not working on iOS safari? can anyone please help?
[09:51:25] <amcsi_work> Oh okay, I don't need the deferred. If I can subscribe to the queue, that is fine
[09:52:02] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: hrm well kinda, but still
[09:52:11] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: why isn't it still big and pink after the page transition then? heh
[09:52:30] <johnkpaul> ha, don't know
[09:52:38] <EdwardIII> arrrgggh
[09:52:44] <EdwardIII> i'll be frank i've been stuck on this for a long time heh

[10:02:53] <jshannon> hi all. i'm using a plugin (roundabout) that resizes a div. As the div is resizing, the text jumps around. see the slider/carousel at http://filmetrics.lerteco.com/ . Also, something similar happens on the demo for the jquery ui effect. The plugin also resizes the div's font-size. I put all sizes (including margins) in em's, which helps, but there's still some text-jumping. Any ideas?
[10:03:20] <gf3> ezioa: Woo Teksavvy!
[10:03:58] <ezioa> acanac is better
[10:04:00] <ezioa> i'm at work
[10:05:56] <gf3> ezioa: Never heard of 'em
[10:07:21] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: nup, i've been reading my ass off
[10:07:30] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: i can't even find an example where someone is trying to do what i'm doing heh
[10:08:11] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: :/ there's nothing obvious wrong about what you're doing, it's just wierd to me that hide/show nav's aren't a standard jquery mobile widget
[10:08:42] <EdwardIII> pretty much exactly what you'd want as a default i would have though
[10:09:06] <EdwardIII> they have collapsable content but it's not really what i'm looking for: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible.html
[10:09:25] <ezioa> gf3, faster, cheaper, unlimted download
[10:11:06] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: just tried switching to alpha in case it was a bug, but nope
[10:11:45] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: can you throw this onto js fiddle w/o the ajax load?
[10:15:53] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: hrm not sure if i can heh
[10:16:14] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: i'm going to head home now... this problem has kicked my ass sufficently, thanks for all your help so far, really handy to have a second pair of eyes to look at a problem
[10:19:23] <daemon> hey all how do I tell .ajax to not strip \n
[10:19:32] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: no problem, have a good night
[10:19:39] <johnkpaul> daemon: processData:false
[10:20:15] <daemon> thank you johnkpaul
[10:20:22] <johnkpaul> np, daemon, have fun
[10:20:37] <Grundell> Hey every one, just wanted to thank the people that have helped me with my last project: "Lost in translation agency", we have now released the app for a test run before we'll start to promote it :) you can find it on http://www.copypanthers.com/lost-in-translation-agency, probably wouldn't make it without your help!
[10:20:55] <quiznilo> lol omg is this true?  'console.log()' throws an error on IE and stops scrip execution?
[10:21:09] <quiznilo> unless 'developer tools' page is open
[10:22:11] <quiznilo> is that true?  that's what it looked like for me
[10:23:07] <daemon> johnkpaul, just as a check to my sanity: http://scsys.co.uk:8002/206218 there is nothing wrong with this right?
[10:23:34] <quiznilo> server sent back text/html type ;p
[10:23:43] <daemon> ahh anyway to override it or do I have to get nginx to
[10:23:55] <quiznilo> no clue about httpd conf
[10:24:06] <daemon> I can get nginx to override it :P I just wondered if I had to
[10:24:15] <quiznilo> I used to, when I did PHP
[10:24:29] <johnkpaul> oh, daemon, process data is for what you send
[10:24:31] <johnkpaul> not for what you get
[10:24:43] <daemon> ah, yep I want to recieve that file with \n included
[10:26:20] <daemon> anyway to do it?
[10:28:29] <daemon> hmm
[10:28:35] <daemon> johnkpaul, any ideas?
[10:29:58] <johnkpaul> daemon: what content type is your server sending in the http response?
[10:30:15] <daemon> johnkpaul, text/html let me override it to send text/text for that dir
[10:31:07] <johnkpaul> plain text
[10:33:08] <daemon> johnkpaul, ok should be updated
[10:35:38] <daemon> curl -I http://logs.hashweb.org/rawlog/%23web/2012-08-23.log |& grep -i content-type
[10:35:38] <daemon> Content-Type: text/text
[10:35:39] <daemon> yep
[10:35:40] <sshaginyan> Hey guys I want to be able to select the an element whose css display property is != 'none'.
[10:35:42] <daemon> johnkpaul, ^
[10:35:43] <sshaginyan> How would I do this?
[10:35:52] <johnkpaul> daemon: text/text isn't a valid content type
[10:36:10] <johnkpaul> sshaginyan: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/
[10:36:11] <daemon> oh
[10:36:13] <daemon>  text/plain?
[10:36:19] <Haprog> that would be
[10:36:25] <johnkpaul> daemon: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Type
[10:36:41] <daemon> ah siorted
[10:37:05] <daemon> yep its opening uin browser instead of trying to download now
[10:37:30] <daemon> %curl -I http://logs.hashweb.org/rawlog/%23web/2012-08-23.log |& grep -i content-type
[10:37:30] <daemon> Content-Type: text/plain
[10:37:32] <NaN> if I use $.getJSON my data will be automatically parsed?
[10:47:05] <Seanmcn> Hi guys can someone tell me why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/vmhk6/6/ - Basically using draggable and droppable, thats all working fine, however drag an image to a yellow box, then move it back to the left to remove it and you can't add another image to the box again. Why is this?
[10:47:36] <daemon> johnkpaul, I have it serving text/plain what else do I need to do to get .ajax calls to not strip \n
[10:49:23] <johnkpaul> daemon: shouldn't be anything,
[10:49:47] <daemon> johnkpaul, http://jsfiddle.net/vAzSW/4/
[10:49:51] <daemon> unless its been cached somewhere
[10:49:55] <daemon> let me swap browser to chrome
[10:50:28] <daemon> christ jsfiddle is slow should have used tinkerbin
[10:51:00] <daemon> yeah still stripping \n
[10:51:16] <johnkpaul> daemon: I don't know how to interpret your fiddle, can you log the response
[10:51:46] <daemon> johnkpaul, the ajax call is right at the bottom of the botom left panel the stuff above it is something to do with yahooapi written by someone else
[10:56:51] <johnkpaul> hm, daemon, I don't know
[10:57:10] <johnkpaul> you're definitely getting \n from jquery
[10:57:14] <johnkpaul> because you're splliting by it
[10:57:21] <johnkpaul> perhaps something else unexpected is happening
[10:58:08] <Croves> Hey guys!! What's up?! :D
[10:58:28] <daemon> johnkpaul, I know im totally lost too -_-
[10:58:48] <daemon> johnkpaul, its kinda like there is a limit on how much it will split by
[10:59:13] <Croves> Well, I have a problem here. I created a table using a loop (in PHP), and one cell of this table have a icon, and when I click on this icon, a cell is displayed
[10:59:20] <Croves> But only the first line is working...
[11:03:20] <Seanmcn> Hi guys can someone tell me why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/vmhk6/6/ - Basically using draggable and droppable, thats all working fine, however drag an image to a yellow box, then move it back to the left to remove it and you can't add another image to the box again. Why is this?
[11:03:35] <Ziggy`> Creating a image and loading it with jQuery, it appears that it doesn't get resized depending on it's defined height in IE9, ex: $('<img />', { 'src' : src, 'css' : { 'height' : '24px' }).load(function() { // Append image here to DOM });
[11:04:20] <ak> ie...
[11:04:27] <ak> it never gets better
[11:04:44] <Ziggy`> It seems it stretches the image
[11:04:53] <Ziggy`> As in, the height get's defined, but the width stays the same
[11:05:08] <Ziggy`> Any suggestions?
[11:05:44] <Croves> http://pastebin.com/V3akp9t9
[11:07:16] <ak> Croves:
[11:07:23] <Ziggy`> ak: Solved !
[11:07:23] <Croves> yup?
[11:07:28] <ak> Croves: you are using here IDs
[11:07:35] <Ziggy`> ak: I needed to define 'width' : 'auto, for it to not stretch in IE
[11:07:37] <ak> one id can only be used one time in html
[11:08:06] <ak> Ziggy`: nice, maybe with normalize css this would be "auto fixed"
[11:08:46] <ak> Croves: so IDs should be uniq, jquery will only look for the first one
[11:09:30] <Croves> ak So I must put this in class?
[11:10:00] <ak> yes, you should use classes here, and always look for the "nearest" container to toggle
[11:10:32] <Croves> What you mean with the "nearest" container?
[11:11:17] <iWarrior> Anyone got any experience in iOS web apps? Need help with scrolling - don't want the viewport to scroll, but what overflow: scroll for a table div to scroll.
[11:11:22] <ak> something like $(this).closest('tr').next().toggle()
[11:13:31] <DomZ> Hi guys, I'm a newbie in jQuery, I have the following selector that works great in jQuery 1.4.4: $('#orgChartArea input[value="50"]')
[11:13:41] <DomZ> but it doesn't work anymore in jQuery 1.7.2
[11:14:18] <DomZ> can someone help me to convert it to jquery 1.7.2 ?
[11:15:22] <ryanneufeld> $('#orgChartArea').find('input[value="50"]')
[11:15:51] <DomZ> thanks ryanneufeld, I will try right now
[11:17:29] <Croves> Thank you ak!
[11:17:32] <ak> Croves: like this
[11:17:33] <ak> http://jsfiddle.net/fUQp7/9/
[11:18:58] <DomZ> ryanneufeld: sorry, it doesn't works :s
[11:19:17] <Croves> ak, thank you! This is very helpful (:
[11:19:26] <ryanneufeld> DomZ: well, thats a bad selector, you shouldn't be selecting on inputs based on value
[11:19:35] <ryanneufeld> ?selectors @ DomZ
[11:19:35] <bot-t> DomZ, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[11:21:09] <ak> $('#orgChartArea').find('input').filter(function() {return $(this).val() == 50})
[11:21:40] <ak> yeah that find is not needed lol
[11:24:27] <Tavp> does the .load() return any data like the $.ajax({}) ?
[11:25:19] <DomZ> ak thanks but it still not working, well let me try by myself :)
[11:25:27] <Eviltwin> Tavp: I believe it returns "this" so you can chain
[11:26:08] <ak> yes, in jquery source it looks like on the end of .load is return this; :)

[11:26:41] <SeanmcnII> Hi guys can someone tell me why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/vmhk6/6/ - Basically using draggable and droppable, thats all working fine, however drag an image to a yellow box, then move it back to the left to remove it and you can't add another image to the box again. Why is this?
[11:26:46] <ak> DomZ: then you are doing something wrong :)
[11:27:04] <ak> maybe the id is not correct, or the values :)
[11:29:55] <rabbi11> is there any way so that i can use dialog modal form with a singe class name and with different buttons and functionalities ?
[11:31:41] <drale2k> Is it a bug that if i already listen to an event with JQ, and i call the "on" method again on the same element with the same listener, that it fires the event twice because it is bound twice ?
[11:32:11] <ak> drale2k: no
[11:32:28] <drale2k> ak: so this is how it should be?
[11:32:32] <ak> yes
[11:32:41] <ak> you can assaign a lot of listeners for one event
[11:32:42] <drale2k> ok
[11:32:44] <ak> -a
[11:33:11] <DomZ> ak : the working selector : $('#orgChartArea').find('input').filter("[value='50']")
[11:33:19] <DomZ> thanks for the "filter" tips :)
[11:33:35] <ak> np, but this should do kind the same :)
[11:33:40] <ak> maybe 50 was a string :O
[11:33:58] <DomZ> ah yes lol
[11:34:46] <ak> but
[11:34:52] <rabbi11> is there any way so that i can use dialog modal form with a singe class name and with different buttons and functionalities ?
[11:35:11] <EyePulp> so I've got a client who will place a single script tag on their page that points to my script.  Part of what I'm doing is creating a pop-up html form (similar to a modal dialog).  The question is - what's the best way to store that form's html and access it to display on the page?  should I embed the html string in my JS as a var, or do a jquery .load() (jquery is on the page already, thankfully)
[11:35:27] <ak> $('#orgChartArea input[value='50']')   is the same as what you wrote...
[11:35:40] <ak> DomZ: ^^^
[11:36:35] <DomZ> ak, you mean that $('#orgChartArea').find('input').filter("[value='50']") is equal to do $('#orgChartArea input[value='50']') ?
[11:36:41] <ak> yes
[11:36:43] <DomZ> the second one is not working for me
[11:36:46] <DomZ> in 1.7.2
[11:37:12] <ak> well you have to change one of the ' to "
[11:37:38] <ak> like $('#orgChartArea input[value="50"]')
[11:37:46] <DomZ> ok let do another try :)
[11:40:47] <Ziggy`> Is the :hover expr not supported by IE8 ? What can I use instead?
[11:42:43] <Ziggy`> I'm using jQuery 1.7.2
[11:42:45] <DomZ> ok you're right, thanks it works :)
[11:42:57] <DomZ> thanks again ak!
[11:43:02] <ak> np
[11:48:12] <SeanmcnII> Hi guys can someone tell me why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/vmhk6/6/ - Basically using draggable and droppable, thats all working fine, however drag an image to a yellow box, then move it back to the left to remove it and you can't add another image to the box again. Why is this?
[11:50:33] <ryanneufeld> SeanmcnII: $(this).empty();
[11:50:37] <ryanneufeld> that's why
[11:50:43] <daemon> why when using this following script do I get an empty alert() http://logs.hashweb.org/
[11:50:52] <ryanneufeld> on every out call it's emptying the div
[11:52:14] <SeanmcnII> ryanneufeld, thank you i dont know why i was overlooking that! Much appreciated
[11:52:30] <ryanneufeld> SeanmcnII: I hope that helps :)
[11:58:27] <iWarrior> Could someone help me with ontouchmove? I need to have only one div possible to scroll in the whole page.
[12:00:56] <NaN> is there a way to get the children's next parent node more clean than this? > http://jsfiddle.net/mFrp2/
[12:04:29] <mjs7231> Is something like this possible with jQuery?  I believe the selector is not working: $("#uploadlist:empty:after").css({content:"My Empty Content"});
[12:05:36] <someprimetime> $('#uploadlist').empty().after('My Empty Content'); ?
[12:05:44] <mjs7231> 2 sec..
[12:05:56] <mjs7231> no wait
[12:06:02] <someprimetime> ?
[12:06:05] <mjs7231> thats different, isn;t it
[12:06:24] <mjs7231> I dont want to change the DOM, just the styles applies to the empty #uploadlist
[12:06:28] <dabear> NaN: that's the easiest way. might wanna replace .parent with .closest("td")
[12:07:00] <dabear> mjs7231: content is not css
[12:07:03] <dabear> css is style
[12:07:05] <someprimetime> dabear++
[12:07:10] <Eviltwin> mjs7231: Why was there an :after in there?
[12:07:22] <NaN> dabear: what could be the difference using .closests instead .parent?
[12:07:24] <mjs7231> dabear, But CSS allows you to add content.
[12:07:41] <someprimetime> so does javascript :P
[12:07:44] <Eviltwin> You can't actually select pseudo elements, they don't actually exist
[12:07:53] <mjs7231> Eviltwin, Ok thanks.
[12:08:00] <Eviltwin> From JavaScript's perspective
[12:08:17] <mjs7231> Off to using <!--[if IE]> then
[12:08:53] <m1chael> can anyone recommend a good content slider?
[12:09:12] <m1chael> i'm trying bxslider but im having a bad time with it
[12:09:15] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: does anyone know why the hovering position isn't on the image if more content is added before it within http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/9bsmt/36/
[12:09:22] <someprimetime> if I take out all that lorem ipsum it works as intended though
[12:09:47] <mjs7231> dabear, YFYI: you can use CSS to apply text to an empty DOM element with something like: .foobar:empty { content:"I am empty"; } -- I was trying to get a different empty message for IE only.
[12:10:01] <someprimetime> didn't mean to @ you evil twin
[12:10:15] <someprimetime> actually, i did originally, but wasn't expecting you to be here
[12:11:19] <dabear> mjs7231: FYI I didnt need that information:)
[12:11:59] <mjs7231> dabear, Just letting you know, it appeared you were unaware that was possible. ;)  -- Take it or leave it, bit no need to be snippy.
[12:12:23] <mjs7231> but*
[12:12:24] <dabear> dunno what snippy is
[12:12:39] <dabear> I know what snoopy is though
[12:12:45] <someprimetime> lol
[12:13:49] <mjs7231> snippy = Curt or sharp, esp. in a condescending way.
[12:14:09] <dabear> dunno what condescending is either
[12:14:20] <dabear> and not what curt is either
[12:14:24] <someprimetime> let's all agree to disagree ;)
[12:14:27] <mjs7231> Is English not your first language?
[12:14:35] <dabear> I guess I'd have to google it
[12:15:17] <jita> how can i make select dropdown such that its value could not be changed ?
[12:15:33] <someprimetime> jita: what would be the use case for that?
[12:16:19] <dabear> jita: use a jquery widget
[12:16:20] <jita> someprimetime, i want to show the status of the profile to the user, although he would not be able to change it, it is only changed by admin
[12:16:27] <jita> dabear, which one?
[12:16:59] <dabear> selectmenu or what its called
[12:17:04] <dabear> don't remember
[12:17:22] <someprimetime> jita: you can just use html
[12:17:36] <someprimetime> <option value="foobar" disabled>Foobar</option>
[12:18:02] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/9bsmt/37/
[12:18:05] <someprimetime> although you should keep in mind you are going to have to prevent them from submitting it
[12:18:09] <someprimetime> with some kind of validation
[12:18:11] <jita> someprimetime, i want to disable the whole select not an option
[12:18:16] <Eviltwin> Also added .js-hover-zoom { position: relative; }
[12:18:26] <someprimetime> you can put disabled on the select itself?
[12:18:29] <jita> someprimetime, if i do this $('#id_status').attr('disabled', true); in my template, it does not work, if i do this in javascript console it works
[12:19:48] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: gah i was thinking of something similar to that just couldn't wrap my head around it
[12:19:53] <someprimetime> thanks :D
[12:19:59] <Eviltwin> Practice makes perfect
[12:19:59] <someprimetime> +1 on prel as well
[12:20:05] <someprimetime> err position: relative;
[12:20:08] <Eviltwin> I've had to do this quite a few times before
[12:29:13] <sisb> I'm struggling with a common issue of jQuery UI tabs wherein charts in an initially hidden tab fail to load properly when the tab gains focus.  I read around and people have proposed modifying the CSS from "display:none !important" to "position:absolute;left:-10000px;"
[12:29:30] <sisb> My problem is that jquery UI doesnt even use the tab hide element, and instead uses jquery show/hide
[12:29:43] <sisb> Is this intended?
[12:38:54] <Rico> Hello there.
[12:39:04] <dialman> Hello
[12:39:22] <Rico> Is anyone familiar with getJson() or parseJson() ? ^^
[12:39:35] <ak> there are some
[12:39:37] <ak> ;)
[12:39:49] <Rico> I guess so :p. are you ?
[12:40:02] <ak> kind of
[12:40:18] <Rico> Can I ask you a few things by PM ?
[12:40:32] <ak> yes
[12:42:06] <terinjokes> I'm getting "Invalid calling object" in IE9, on 1.6.4
[12:42:40] <daemon> in jquery in a .each loop can I use 'next;' like in perl to skip to the next iteration
[12:45:28] <Eviltwin> daemon: Have you used anonymous functions in perl?
[12:45:40] <daemon> Eviltwin, yes
[12:48:37] <jita> how to check if radiobox is selected or not ?
[12:48:57] <Eviltwin> daemon: So $.each is like this in Perl: http://pastebin.com/LP3PNCe5
[12:49:43] <Eviltwin> Which you would call like this: each([2,4,5], sub { my ($i, $o)=@_; print "$i: $o\n"; });
[12:50:03] <daemon> Eviltwin, indeed but you can still use next even in a for loop
[12:50:16] <Eviltwin> So if you want to skip to the next iteration, you actually want to return from the function
[12:50:25] <daemon> ah
[12:51:14] <daemon> thank you Eviltwin

[13:04:20] <ifdef43> BTW it's completely open source.
[13:08:00] <imsky> "Only Google Chrome or Chromium are supported right now."
[13:08:04] * imsky is using firefox
[13:08:44] <ifdef43> sorry about that...
[13:08:59] <imsky> i get that it's for webkit, but come on
[13:11:38] <tw2113> if it's because some of the features used aren't in Firefox yet, that's fine, if it's just too lazy to moz prefix, booooooo
[13:12:40] <ifdef43> early versions worked everywhere, i primarily use firefox myself. but at some point because of some file API that was only on Chromium, we became Chromium-specific
[13:12:52] <ifdef43> and because of that we haven't been testing on anything else.
[13:12:53] <someprimetime> out of curiosity who is your target audience?
[13:13:02] <imsky> jq mobile developers
[13:13:04] <imsky> cant you read
[13:13:16] <someprimetime> no just can't scroll :P
[13:13:30] <imsky> u lazy bum
[13:14:03] <ifdef43> it's still a good question, despite plenty of work we're not completely sure.
[13:14:09] <imsky> ifdef43 one reason non-firefox support is bad is jqmob is cross-platform by design
[13:14:58] <imsky> ifdef43 also where are the pages?
[13:15:15] <imsky> nvm on the left
[13:15:25] <someprimetime> adding an HSV color picker and pressing Preview cuts off half of the widget
[13:16:07] <ifdef43> someprimetime, yeah those web-ui-fw widgets have been stalled and we've dropped them from the latest code, on github or the twopenguins.org/rib link
[13:16:21] <someprimetime> i just added another one and it's showing me a preview of the actual page within the screen
[13:16:33] <ifdef43> they did not react to size changes nicely like standard jqm widets
[13:16:39] <someprimetime> e.g. http://i.imgur.com/9LS9z.png
[13:17:25] <ifdef43> heh, nice. i know a bug or two have been fixed along those lines. i think you're using the 01.org online version from april
[13:17:50] <imsky> ifdef43 how do i add a persistent footer?
[13:18:29] <LifeSF> hi,... anyone? bottom scroll works fine for the footer but problem is that the whole page (body, not just footer) scrolls out of screen.... http://pastebin.com/68B6r9Tf
[13:19:42] <ifdef43> imsky, we support i think a pretty large percentage of the stuff documented in jqm docs, but that's one hole. it seemed a bit challenging to fit into our UI, if you have an idea for how it could work, let me know.
[13:19:54] <imsky> lol no idea, it's why i use sencha now
[13:19:58] <ifdef43> e.g. maybe on page 2, you could say use the same footer from page1 or something
[13:21:47] <LifeSF> huh?
[13:22:20] <LifeSF> oh sry guys, loll i got mixed up! :P
[13:22:27] <imsky> oh u
[13:22:43] <LifeSF> but if anyone here can help on that thing that makes my page disappear that'd be super nice :)
[13:23:01] <imsky> yeah
[13:23:06] <imsky> rm "page.html"
[13:23:39] <LifeSF> what?
[13:23:52] <imsky> u not 2 brite
[13:24:03] <LifeSF> -_-
[13:24:38] <LifeSF> your joke sucks, don't even have index.html lol
[13:24:49] <imsky> ya...sux
[13:24:57] <LifeSF> anyways.... could pleeeasse?
[13:25:18] <LifeSF> i mean it works fine, my problem is it works TOO fine,.. :S
[13:25:34] <LifeSF> because it works so good that it does more than required to -_-
[13:27:00] <sjeijk> can any1 explain me what this means? You need to identify with network services to join the room "##php" on "irc.freenode.net".
[13:27:14] <someprimetime> sjeijk: i think you have to register that nick
[13:27:23] <someprimetime> msg nickserv
[13:27:31] <Pwnna> when i have a bunch of nodes under a div container, and i empty that div container then readd the nodes, all the click event handlers disappears
[13:27:33] <Pwnna> how do i preserve that?
[13:27:34] <sjeijk> msg nickserv
[13:27:40] <someprimetime> prefix with /
[13:28:12] <imsky> ?delegate @ Pwnna
[13:28:14] <bot-t> Pwnna, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:28:21] <sjeijk> is nickserv some1?
[13:28:29] <imsky> ya
[13:28:30] <imsky> me
[13:28:35] <Pwnna> imsky: i don';t think that works?
[13:28:38] <imsky> msg me ur password
[13:28:43] <imsky> Pwnna, lol
[13:28:52] <Pwnna> because i'm essentially doing container.empty
[13:29:01] <Pwnna> for t in things, container.append t
[13:29:23] <Pwnna> though i lose all the click handlers in all the buttons i have under t
[13:30:30] <Pwnna> i remember there's like something that
[13:30:49] <Pwnna> preserves the event handlers but still allow you to remove the node from being displayed on a page
[13:34:12] <Pwnna> detach!
[13:34:13] <Pwnna> there it is
[13:34:17] <Pwnna> i wish there's empty version
[13:34:18] <Pwnna> ff
[13:34:24] <Pwnna> alright
[13:37:21] <sjeijk> thanks someprimetime
[13:37:30] <someprimetime> np
[13:38:36] <ifdef43> LifeSF, do you mean scrollPos = docHeight - windowHeight - height? (minus, instead of plus, perhaps?)
[13:39:50] <LifeSF> ifdef43: well that somewhat fixed it... but not completely,.. my page stil scrolls up just not as bad
[13:40:26] <ifdef43> LifeSF, i suck at reverse engineering code... what are the values for all those numbers right now?
[13:40:38] <ifdef43> window height, doc height, footer height, etc.
[13:41:13] <LifeSF> http://www.moncoiffeur.ca/ that'll let you see the thing in action
[13:41:14] <ifdef43> you have also cached the 'height' of the footer content from startup, but seem to be changing it with the animate maybe, so that might be bogus
[13:45:49] <LifeSF> well... it's already better, thnx ifdef43 :)
[13:46:16] <ifdef43> LifeSF, why is the main doc scrolling at all in this case, not sure i get it
[13:46:36] <LifeSF> you see it hey? i have no clue
[13:47:35] <LifeSF> ifdef43: but it's ok, like i said it's already much better thanks :)
[13:48:21] <ifdef43> LifeSF, hehe, alright. could be that the actual footer now is different from the initial height you measured
[13:50:35] <ifdef43> LifeSF, oh i see there's the "header" in there too... i bet it's off by the height of the header. so if you subtracted that too, it might work. or something.
[13:53:59] <LifeSF> well now it stays at the top lollll... why does the main page move at all :S
[13:55:14] <ifdef43> i take it you're inheriting this code :)
[13:55:41] <ifdef43> good lesson: use comments when you do inexplicable stuff :D
[14:03:45] <LifeSF> lots of comments on my pages loll everything is divided and marked :P
[14:19:32] <sunbeam> does anyone know how I can give certain dates a class ?
[14:19:38] <sunbeam> with jquery ui datepicker?
[14:19:45] <sunbeam> like "booked-date"
[14:20:45] <lyrae> sunbeam: perhaps you can use a onclick function
[14:20:52] <lyrae> and append a class to it
[14:26:55] <Slugge> sunbeam: u could do a loop that checks each div's text for a specific date (i.e check 1-31) and if it finds the number a class could be assigned
[14:29:51] <sunbeam> lyrae: its inline, not on click
[14:30:12] <sunbeam> Slugge: yea, but i guess datepicker should have suchj default functionanlity
[14:30:46] <Slugge> maybe :)
[14:30:49] <ak> sunbeam: how should this work?
[14:31:11] <ak> like some dates should be highlighted in the datepicker?
[14:31:21] <sunbeam> yep
[14:31:29] <sunbeam> some calendar dtaes I will change the background image
[14:34:01] <ak> it is possible
[14:36:27] <sunbeam> how?
[14:36:34] <sunbeam> with datepicker default functionality/options
[14:36:42] <ak> kind of yes
[14:38:05] <ak> i will make a mockup for you on jsfiddle
[14:38:24] <lerais> hi
[14:40:41] <lerais> I'm trying to create a hover effect on a set of items. Let's say I have 8 paragraphs, and 4 background colors. Each color is for each p element, and after the 4th p element the 5th p element will start over with the first color.
[14:41:30] <lerais> So when you hover over the element you'll get some sort of rainbow effect. I've set up a fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/K5RvH/2/ but I don't know where to start doing this, so any help would be appreciated
[14:43:03] <astropirate> lerais, look at the elements position in your list. look at how many elements there are in your list. and then do some math on every hover event to figure out what color it shoudl have
[14:44:29] <lerais> astropirate: should I start doing a foreach cycle for example?
[14:47:18] <ak> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/RHDV5/7/
[14:47:26] <ak> well that's the idea
[14:47:38] <ak> needs some work, but this is how you can make it
[14:47:49] <sshaginyan> So I'm getting back a page form a $.post which contains html header title and body. I only want the stuff in body. How would I do this?
[14:50:44] <zduffy> I don't understand what is wrong with this snippet? http://pastebin.com/HaD4te9Q
[14:50:46] <ak> sshaginyan: you could use something like this as success: function(data) { $(data).find(body).contents()}
[14:51:32] <sshaginyan> ty
[14:51:43] <sisb> Why does jQuery UI 1.9 milestone 8 for Tabs use show/hide
[14:52:09] <sisb> instead of addClass/removeClass(''.ui-tabs-hide");
[14:52:13] <sshaginyan> ak: It says body is not defined
[14:52:23] <ak> well
[14:52:26] <astropirate> lerais, no need for that. I believe jquery comes with convenience methods to get the the elements position within its parent element. (i could be wrong)
[14:52:27] <sshaginyan> but this works $(data)?
[14:52:29] <ak> .find('body')
[14:52:29] <astropirate> but check it out
[14:52:34] <sshaginyan> sorry
[14:53:10] <ak> $(data).find('body').contents() ...
[14:54:13] <sshaginyan> ak empty object
[14:54:46] <ak> sshaginyan: try to put it on jsfiddle, and i can take a look
[14:54:53] <sshaginyan> ak: k
[14:55:41] <sshaginyan> http://jsfiddle.net/CLDX2/
[14:56:19] <sshaginyan> ak: When I do console.log(data) it returns a valid html page
[14:57:34] <ajpiano> sshaginyan: benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#htmldoc http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7784
[14:59:37] <ajpiano> bot-t:  htmldoc is If you're trying to pass an entire HTML document to jQuery(), it won't work just right. But it can! See http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#htmldoc for a fix and http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7784 for context.
[14:59:37] <bot-t> ajpiano, Stored "htmldoc".
[14:59:38] <ak>  hm
[14:59:58] <ak> there you have it
[15:00:27] <sshaginyan> ty
[15:00:34] <ak> i'm not sure, but you could also try this:   $.post('/patches/edit_multiple body' ...
[15:00:48] <ak> maybe this will return only the body part
[15:00:52] <ak> but i'm not sure
[15:01:41] <sshaginyan> ak: Nope that didn't work
[15:02:03] <ak> hmm hmm
[15:02:26] <ak> sunbeam ?
[15:06:57] <terinjokes> I'm getting "Invalid calling object" in IE9, on 1.6.4. I thought 1.5 added support for IE9?
[15:07:58] <ak> sorry, i don't think that a lot of people here can help you with browser support questions of old jquery versions :(
[15:11:43] <lerais> astropirate: i think i'm almost there, check it out http://jsfiddle.net/K5RvH/3/ I just need to add the class to each element right now. For some reason i'm gettint an error doing it
[15:12:19] <astropirate> lerais, addClass takes a string
[15:12:45] <astropirate> that string being the class name
[15:12:50] <lerais> hmm
[15:14:03] <astropirate> lerais, I g2g. i'll be back later
[15:14:14] <lerais> gluck!
[15:16:42] <ak> lerais: http://jsfiddle.net/Gy8LU/1/
[15:17:56] <lerais> thanks ak!
[15:18:05] <lerais> that was exactly what I was aiming for
[15:18:48] <bung> the multiple-selector bind seems a bit simple $('.s1, .s2, .s3').on(..., whats the best way to do it with "more complex" jquery objects, like attaching the same .on() to both $('.c1', obj') and $('#id > .c2') ... put them all together and then $.each() ?
[15:19:33] <johnkpaul> bung: multiple selectors can be separated with commas even if it's not just classes
[15:19:37] <bung> $([$('.c1', obj'), $('#id > .c2')]).each(function(){ this.on(...); });
[15:19:49] <johnkpaul> $('.ci, #id > .c2').on works fine
[15:19:52] <bung> but what about the one that has, uh, what do you call it
[15:20:17] <bung> uhm, this: $('.c1', obj) is like "in obj"
[15:20:30] <johnkpaul> oh, you mean selecting by context
[15:20:31] <yuotoo>  ^ÂÊÎÔÛâêîôûĈĉĜĝĤĥĴĵŜŝŴŵŶŷˆ̭̂᷍ḒḓḘḙḼḽṊṋṰṱṶṷẐẑẤấẦầẨẩẪẫẬậẾếỀềỂểỄễỆệỐốỒồỔổỖỗỘộ⨣⨶⩯ꞈ＾󠁞
[15:20:40] <bung> yea if you wanted to do both
[15:20:40] <ajpiano> bun, makes a lot more sense to just not use an anoymous function
[15:20:41] <johnkpaul> hm, if you need to pass the object there, then you can't do what I described
[15:21:03] <bung> johnkpaul: thats why i feel like multiple-selector on the docs is a bit simple
[15:21:20] <bung> i mean making it an array is kinda funny, but it works like i did it above i think  yea?
[15:21:28] <lerais> ak: how would I remove that class with a fade out or something like that after the hover is done?
[15:21:34] <ajpiano> bung: function doStuff();  $("div.stuff").click( doStuff ); $(".otherStuff", blah).mouseenter( doStuff );
[15:21:39] <ajpiano> bung: you can also use add
[15:21:59] <bung> ajpiano: yea i can do it one line at a time i guess :)
[15:22:02] <ajpiano> $(".someStuff").add( $(".foo", bar) ).click( function(){}):
[15:22:19] <bung> i dont think there is a pretty solution, ah well
[15:22:29] <bung> one line at a time then is probably the most readable
[15:22:45] <bung> doing \n .add() \n .add() is not my fav
[15:22:55] <bung> thanks for the input
[15:24:04] <ak>  lerais http://jsfiddle.net/Gy8LU/2/
[15:24:33] <[Araelium]Seth> 'ello. Hopefully a question:  I'm replacing an element after an AJAX request. The new element's html contains a script tag with a $(document).ready();  It gets called on the first page load, but not after the replaceWith, because obviously that document event has already fired.  What's the best way to handle this?
[15:24:36] <ak> bung: i like \n .add ...
[15:24:57] <lerais> ak: awesome, i got it :) thx again
[15:25:05] <Eviltwin> [Araelium]Seth: You're right that it's not running but wrong about why
[15:25:10] <bung> ak: it does seem like the jquery thing doesnt it :)
[15:25:21] <[Araelium]Seth> Eviltwin: oh.
[15:25:31] <bleen> the toggle() mouse event is listed as deprecated … what is the correct event to use in its place?
[15:26:07] <bung> (toggle is an event?)
[15:26:24] * bung reads
[15:26:31] <ak> bung ..
[15:26:33] <bleen> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[15:26:36] <bleen> bung ^
[15:26:41] <ak> bung i'm thinking about some solution for you...
[15:26:44] <bung> ywea im there :)
[15:27:05] <ak> i would make probably some array with the selector things...
[15:27:12] <bung> yea i did have that above
[15:27:23] <bung> $([$('.c1', obj), $('#id > .c2')]).each(function(){ this.on(...); });
[15:27:32] <ajpiano> ew
[15:27:34] <bung> .add is much prettier
[15:27:35] <b-ot> bung, memorised “add”.
[15:27:35] <ajpiano> jesues
[15:27:40] <ajpiano> haha yeah it is
[15:27:44] <ajpiano> b-ot: forget add
[15:27:44] <b-ot> ajpiano, I have forgotten “add”. My mind is going, I can feel it.
[15:27:44] <bung> ;)
[15:27:46] <[Araelium]Seth> Eviltwin: the real reason is…….?
[15:27:57] <ak> $.each(array, function(i, e) { $(e).on('event', namedFunction(data))});
[15:28:21] <bung> wow you write each nicer than i do
[15:28:32] <bung> makes sense
[15:29:01] <ajpiano> ak: that will execute the function at bind time and return its result to be used as the handler soooo
[15:29:40] <bung> that toggle-event is really cool, thanks
[15:29:40] <ak> ajpiano: yeah that could be :)
[15:29:59] <bung> did we answer his question though about the replacement?
[15:30:07] <ak> so no (data) ... :)
[15:30:23] <ak> (i don't know the toggle event :( )
[15:30:28] <adamholwerda> Araelium[Seth] Your code would run with the document ready, so that isn't the issue. Provide more information about your specific use case - are you replacing an element with events bound to it?
[15:30:44] <Eviltwin> [Araelium]Seth: jQuery's trying to protect you: http://jsfiddle.net/9SCFb/
[15:31:53] <ak> bung: $('body').on('event', myArray.join(','), function() {})  maybe? :)
[15:32:20] <bung> whaaat
[15:32:26] <bung> you crazy, let me rtfm
[15:33:45] <ak> but for the best option i would need to rtfjqs for 30min, but i go sleep ;)
[15:34:11] <bung> lol np thanks
[15:34:18] <ak> ~
[15:34:50] <[Araelium]Seth> hmm
[15:35:19] <[Araelium]Seth> Bypassing jquery, I can't get that same thing to run anything in the <script>
[15:39:31] <[Araelium]Seth> Wonky.
[15:39:51] <[Araelium]Seth> I can .innerHTML = '<p>foobar</p>'; and see that
[15:40:12] <[Araelium]Seth> but if instead of the p, i use <script>alert("foobar");</script> i never see it.
[15:40:17] <[Araelium]Seth> no errors.
[15:41:19] <lmao25> http://pastie.org/4577212 <-- How can i make it so the function returns a true value if the success is true?
[15:42:42] <bung> lmao25: asynchronous calls dont work like that
[15:42:55] <lmao25> how would i go about it then?
[15:42:58] <bung> if you need something to happen after success, pass it in and call it
[15:42:59] <lmao25> not really sure...
[15:43:41] <bung> but thats just my pedestrian way of doing it, im sure some experts here could be more help
[15:43:49] <bung> or at least give you good search terms for that kinda thing
[15:44:03] <bung> i'd expect its in a cookbook or something under some fancy name *shrug*
[15:45:53] <lmao25> bung, what do you mean by pass it in and call it?
[15:46:44] <bung> validateField(field, input, success){ ... $.ajax(... success: function(){ success(); } ... ) ... };
[15:46:47] <bung> something or other
[15:50:36] <[Araelium]Seth> Eviltwin: Any ideas why this wouldn't be working for me…  $("#foo")[0].innerHTML = '<p>foo</p><script>alert("bar");</script>'  The p is added the page, but the script doesn't run and I can't see any reason this is any different than your jsfiddle which works fine.
[15:51:11] <Slugge> im trying to give a specific span .text(data.user), the issue im having is that this span is in success.php which is loaded through .load() after a succesful login, and does not contain the script
[15:51:40] <lerais> is it possible to get an elements background color using jquery?
[15:51:41] <Slugge> the page that loads success.php does contain the script though
[15:51:51] <lerais> *element
[15:52:02] <LindsayM_> Hey guys.. I have kind of a half jquery half CSS question. I feel like it should be a stupid easy thing, but I am having major issues with it. I am trying to make a background of a container fixed, but make sure that while scrolling it pushes the elements above it up and out of the viewport. A working example is here: http://jsfiddle.net/agtEd/1/
[15:52:13] <[Araelium]Seth> member:lerais: .css()
[15:52:18] <[Araelium]Seth> blah
[15:52:31] <LindsayM_> The issue is that I am using the swipe.js code which adds a few containers and some styles and I think that is the issue. The not working code is here http://bscdeveloper.com/millwrights/#
[15:52:32] <Slugge> .css(background-color)
[15:52:43] <lerais> awesome
[15:52:47] <lerais> thanks
[15:54:25] <Slugge> LindsayM_: could u post the css for that script?
[15:54:48] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  you should be able to see it when viewing the site..
[15:55:04] <LindsayM_> ohh shoot.. i forgot to add, you need a user agent switcher. Switch to iphone
[15:55:06] <Slugge> ya nvm, didnt see u posted it
[15:55:17] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  make sure to have user agent to iphone or ipad
[15:55:30] <Slugge> my iphone broke 1 month ago so :(
[15:56:10] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  you can look at it just fine with a user agent switcher for your browser
[15:56:14] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  what browser do you use/
[15:56:16] <LindsayM_> ?
[15:56:20] <Slugge> ff
[15:56:28] <Slugge> got all the major ones for testing though :)
[15:56:54] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  then go to the addons section and look for a user agent switcher addon.
[15:57:05] <Slugge> but when i browsed the site with ff i saw u had some issues with content going outside of the bg picture, unless its meant for smaller screens :P
[15:57:24] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  i have no idea what you're looking at, but I am looking at a specific thing right now
[15:58:37] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  do you understand what I am saying here?
[15:59:01] <Slugge> user agent switcher, i understand yeh
[15:59:21] <Slugge> http://i.imgur.com/CfFdB.jpg <--- this is what i was talking about btw
[15:59:28] <LindsayM_> Oh shoot..
[15:59:33] <LindsayM_> sorry
[15:59:39] <LindsayM_> http://bscdeveloper.com/millwrights
[15:59:41] <LindsayM_> ^^
[15:59:43] <LindsayM_> wrong link
[15:59:51] <LindsayM_> i gave you the live link.. their splash page
[16:00:10] <Slugge> both looks the same
[16:00:12] <LindsayM_> which apparently looks like HELL on your screen
[16:00:24] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  one sec
[16:00:29] <Slugge> obviously not made for 1920x1080
[16:00:30] <LindsayM_> sorry i just set up the duplicate site
[16:00:50] <LindsayM_> fresh the new domain i gave you
[16:01:00] <LindsayM_> no...that splash page wasn't me..  but anyways
[16:01:14] <Slugge> looks good now yeh
[16:01:20] <LindsayM_> Ok cool
[16:01:52] <LindsayM_> so when you make your browser small (iphone size) and you go to the ABOUT page (it has a lot of text) you can see when you try to scroll, the damn bg image for the background will not stay put
[16:01:54] <Slugge> installed switch agent
[16:02:08] <LindsayM_> Slugge: its cool huh?
[16:02:17] <bung> lmao25: how goes it?
[16:02:34] <LindsayM_> I am trying to get it to go like this example http://jsfiddle.net/agtEd/1/
[16:02:37] <Slugge> its cool yeh, kind of useless though since most users wont have it :P
[16:02:45] <LindsayM_> huh?
[16:02:48] <LindsayM_> most wont have what?
[16:02:51] <Slugge> nvm
[16:03:01] <Slugge> but im guessing its the css thats wrong
[16:03:20] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  ive meddled around in the CSS a lot.. I'm not new to this...
[16:03:25] <LindsayM_> i am just seriously stuck
[16:04:15] <gbelot> wow... how many people are here???
[16:04:38] <ryanneufeld> LindsayM_: your example show's a fixed background. Which as far as I can tell you have on your pages. are you wanting it to be fixed for each div that's scrolling into view?
[16:04:56] <LindsayM_> ryanneufeld:  which example are you looking at?
[16:05:02] <ryanneufeld> http://bscdeveloper.com/millwrights/
[16:05:09] <ryanneufeld> whatever is current there
[16:05:13] <LindsayM_> basically just want the background image of the <article> element to stay put when you scroll.. it is not
[16:05:26] <LindsayM_> ryanneufeld:  this is an example of what i WANT it to do http://jsfiddle.net/agtEd/1/
[16:05:34] <ryanneufeld> background-position: fixed
[16:05:37] <ryanneufeld> doesn't that do it?
[16:05:38] <LindsayM_> its almost identical css but works there and not one mine
[16:05:49] <LindsayM_> ryanneufeld:  did you try and scroll?? It does not stay put
[16:05:50] <Slugge> LindsayM_: i tried the website on my ipad now, there seems to be some other issues there aswell
[16:06:11] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  i am not interested in dealing with every issue. I am going through one at a time
[16:06:19] <ryanneufeld> it all scales to my browser window
[16:06:22] <ryanneufeld> I can't scroll
[16:06:42] <LindsayM_> ryanneufeld:  you can resize your browser window easily ;)
[16:06:52] <ryanneufeld> it all scales to my browser window
[16:06:56] <ogk1000> if I have <a href="#">some text</a> how do I get the some text... is it .val .html .text or ?
[16:07:01] <ryanneufeld> which means, when I resize it, so does the content
[16:07:01] <ryanneufeld> :P
[16:07:06] <Slugge> LindsayM_: aight, but seems this has to do with the same, also when i change my browser window to 1024x768  i get another background-image
[16:07:15] <ryanneufeld> LindsayM_: your fiddle has a fixed image
[16:07:22] <ryanneufeld> maybe I'm not understanding your instructions
[16:07:25] <LindsayM_> so does my example?
[16:07:30] <Slugge> ogk1000: .text()
[16:07:52] <ryanneufeld> LindsayM_: on your example, the bg doesn't move when you scroll, which is what you want correct?
[16:07:59] <LindsayM_> yes
[16:08:22] <ogk1000> anyone know of / had to deal with fixing double tooltip issue with IE
[16:08:22] <Slugge> ryanneufeld: try scaling the browser window fast, u will get another background-image instead
[16:08:30] <Slugge> not sure if that is what he's aiming at though
[16:08:40] <Slugge> since the site scales when browser window does
[16:09:08] <LindsayM_> this theme ONLY shows when viewing as an iphone/ipad... i do not need to account for resizing windows.
[16:09:22] <ryanneufeld> Okay
[16:09:41] <LindsayM_> thats why I said you need the user agent switcher to view it
[16:09:49] <Slugge> well, the site does not function at all on my ipad so cant really tell u how the scroll works
[16:10:19] <ryanneufeld> I set my UA to iphone ios5
[16:10:23] <ryanneufeld> I see a differnt theme now
[16:10:39] <LindsayM_> OMG you were looking at the wrong site the whole time.. sheesh
[16:10:52] <ryanneufeld> like I said, probably didn't understand your instructions
[16:12:13] <ryanneufeld> okay, I see the problem now
[16:12:32] <ryanneufeld> using jqm I see?
[16:12:53] <ogk1000> anyone against using a <noscript> with css?
[16:13:04] <LindsayM_> no
[16:13:06] <ryanneufeld> no
[16:13:07] <LindsayM_> not using jqm
[16:13:19] <LindsayM_> that was a MASSIVE pain in the ass...
[16:13:23] <ogk1000> I hate that it doesnt validate
[16:13:30] <ryanneufeld> ogk1000: validation doesn't matter
[16:13:38] <ogk1000> just annoying :(
[16:13:50] <ogk1000> and if I have it in a .css and remove it with JS.. it still loads initially
[16:14:04] <ryanneufeld> "OMG THIS COOL WEBSITE DOESN"T VALIDATE" Said no users ever
[16:14:06] <ogk1000> stupid validation ppl
[16:14:11] <ogk1000> lol ryanneufeld
[16:14:30] <Slugge> http://i.imgur.com/XHEK7.png <--- heres how the site looks on the ipad
[16:14:46] <[Araelium]Seth> Eviltwin: I think your example in jsfiddle working as it does is a side effect of jsfiddle. There's something more complicated going on. See this example: http://sethwillits.com/temp/test.html
[16:16:10] <[Araelium]Seth> ie, note that the alert for jQuery does work, and javascript does not.
[16:16:20] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  just realized i had the overflow removed. Try again
[16:16:21] <[Araelium]Seth> Which is the opposite of jsfiddle.
[16:16:29] <LindsayM_> although not sure why you arent getting the bg image on your ipad
[16:17:28] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  because it looks fine on my ipad.. although one image is broken.. im not worried about that stuff right now.
[16:17:40] <Slugge> it works now, but no problem with scroll here either
[16:18:23] <LindsayM_> what are you talking about??? The background image is SCROLLING it should stay in place
[16:20:22] <Slugge> only "issue" i see is in landscape mode where u still see the entire bg picture which scrolls, but thats what i expected it to do in landscape mode
[16:20:23] <[Araelium]Seth> adamholwerda: This is what I am referring to: http://sethwillits.com/temp/test2.html
[16:21:21] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  scroll VERTICALLY when on the about page.. the background image moves with the scroll. I am trying to get it to stay static like in my jsfiddle example
[16:21:27] <LindsayM_> i am not sure how else I can explain it
[16:21:46] <Slugge> thats what im doing, no issues with it
[16:21:47] <[Araelium]Seth> adamholwerda: I'm triggering an AJAX request which gets some HTML. That same HTML snippet (slightly modified) is used in the initial page build, so it contains a .ready() handler to run some stuff.  I need to do effectively the same thing, but after having done the AJAX and a replace.
[16:21:59] <[Araelium]Seth> adamholwerda: hopefully that's clearer.
[16:22:33] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  i have no idea what to say. On the actual site demo the background image is MOVING with the scroll.. on my jsfiddle example it is staying put as the text moves over it.
[16:22:43] <Slugge> http://pastebin.com/RuVaVTCK <--- on line 14 here im trying to give span.username some text, span.username only exists in success.php which is loaded on line 13, but does not function as i hoped, is there any other way to tackle this?
[16:23:14] <Slugge> LindsayM_: its working fine on my ipad atleast
[16:23:25] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  its not. You are not understanding
[16:24:12] <Slugge> im completely understanding, im watching the background and it does not move, unless its in landscape mode, but i would expect it to move while scrolling there, as the image is zoomed in
[16:24:58] <LindsayM_> Slugge:  i have my ipad right in front of me. you are NOT understanding. When you scroll vertically the background image follows the text up and down. It does not stay still as the text moves over it while scrolling
[16:27:01] <bleen> Can someone point me towards a plugin or an example of some JS that moves a DIV if it is out of the viewport to make sure its visible to the user. I'm not sure what to google here…
[16:27:50] <ThrushAAX> bleen: is it supposed to be visible all the time?
[16:28:00] <LindsayM_> bleen:  you can do that with CSS by just giving it a position:absolute and fix it to the top
[16:29:43] <bleen> Sorry.. let e clarify. I have a tooltip-like div that shows up if a user clicks a certain button. Sometimes that tooltip will be large and so (because it is positioned relative to the clicked button) it can ocasionally end up off the screen. I want to make sure that cant happen … but in general the tooltip should still be positioned relative tothe button. Make sense?
[16:30:12] <Eviltwin> bleen: Generally what you do is measure the width of the tooltip and add that to the offset from the left side of the screen
[16:30:24] <Eviltwin> If that is greater than the width of the screen, you make it face the other way instead
[16:30:33] <Eviltwin> Where it sticks off the left side of the mouse
[16:30:34] <LindsayM_> All so if the button is close to the right side you dont want it to display directly centered above because the right side can be cut off .
[16:30:36] <LindsayM_> i understand
[16:30:47] <bleen> Eviltwin: yes, that is what Im looking for. Is there an example you can point me to?
[16:30:58] <sisb> Why is jQuery UI calling Add on my tabs twice?
[16:31:41] <sisb> I do $tabs.tabs('add', id); and it loads an empty pane div 1, then a content filled pane div2
[16:32:01] <LindsayM_> bleen:  https://gist.github.com/2254f48dea7f2bd5fd50
[16:32:05] <w00tner> hello my friends can anyone help´me out
[16:32:38] <bleen> LindsayM_: awesome … thanks!
[16:33:16] <LindsayM_> bleen:  hopefully that can get you started at least
[16:33:29] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @w00tner
[16:33:29] <bot-t> w00tner, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:34:13] <w00tner> Why i keep getting this: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL "   in console.... here: www.cuponaria.com/json/   ---   JS CODE: http://jsfiddle.net/2PT4b/20/
[16:35:30] <LindsayM_> I still could use some help here.. I am trying to set a background position as fixed and even though it says it's fixed, it's still scrolling with a vertical scroll. You can replicate by going here http://bscdeveloper.com/millwrights (with a user agent switched to iphone) and clicking the ABOUT page (window size set to iphone as well)
[16:36:08] <zduffy> Whats the easiest way to compare text box values from different forms?
[16:36:17] <zduffy> Im assuming validate
[16:37:19] <LindsayM_> I have an example of what i am TRYING to do here on the fiddle.. just can't get it to work on my site http://jsfiddle.net/agtEd/1/
[16:38:00] <Eviltwin> w00tner: You've managed to type a weird unicode character at the end of the script block
[16:38:14] <Eviltwin> w00tner: Try deleting the </script> and a few characters before than and retyping them
[16:39:57] <LindsayM_> I can't believe i'm having issues with a simple fixed BG image..
[16:39:59] <LindsayM_> never
[16:41:35] <LindsayM_> So anyone out there wanna look at my stupid fixed BG issue?
[16:43:23] <w00tner> Thanks Eviltwin
[16:43:28] <w00tner> i'll check it out
[16:44:29] <w00tner> omg
[16:44:30] <w00tner> i love you
[16:45:11] <LindsayM_> :/
[16:46:13] <w00tner> lets see lindsay
[16:46:38] <LindsayM_> see what?
[16:51:48] <LindsayM_> So anyone wanna jump on in?
[16:52:08] <Eviltwin> I think w00tner was trying to
[16:52:15] <LindsayM_> Ohh.. oops!
[16:52:23] <LindsayM_> w00tner:  sorry.. misunderstood
[16:52:52] <LindsayM_> I have a site here (have to view with user agent set to iphone and window  small to replicate) http://bscdeveloper.com/millwrights/
[16:53:08] <LindsayM_> If you browse to the ABOUT page, you can see a page with lots of text that you have to scroll up/down to see..
[16:53:16] <bleathem> This a good place to ask about jquery ui?
[16:53:20] <LindsayM_> I have the background set to fixed, but its not staying fixed!
[16:53:32] <LindsayM_> here is an example of what i WANT to happen http://jsfiddle.net/agtEd/1/
[16:53:39] <bleathem> ah yes, I see it in the channel topic
[16:53:39] <LindsayM_> bleathem:  sure
[16:54:01] <bleathem> Why doesn't the jquery ui selectable expose a select method in it's interface?  Is this something just waiting for a contribution?
[16:54:09] <LindsayM_> I am thinking that the swipe.js plugin I have is effecting it somehow, but I can not seem to replicate it in the jsfiddle so I am lost as to wht to do!
[16:55:19] <LindsayM_> bleathem:  not sure what you mean by select method, but im relatively new to jquery
[16:55:19] <bleathem> wow, 823 people in here
[16:55:25] <LindsayM_> yea its quiet tonight...
[16:55:59] <bleathem> I mean a way to select items via an API, and net requiring one to click on them
[16:56:11] <LindsayMac> Ahhh
[16:57:02] <Eviltwin> You could .click() it
[16:57:18] <Eviltwin> I think you can also just add the selected class
[16:57:45] <k1t_> hey folks, im trying to use UI Sortable but when i make an AJAX post to the server, the list just freezes... any ideas? Here is my sortable() call: https://gist.github.com/3443749
[16:57:54] <k1t_> pretty stuck on this one ): lol
[17:00:31] <LindsayMac> Anyone wanna help out? I feel so utterly STUCK
[17:00:36] <LindsayMac> as im sure k1t_ does too
[17:00:48] <k1t_> haha
[17:00:48] <k1t_> :)
[17:00:53] <LindsayMac> k1t_:  it might help if you can rebuild your code on jsfiddle though
[17:01:00] <k1t_> indeed, I will continue trying
[17:01:02] <k1t_> ah yeh good idea
[17:01:08] <bleathem> Eviltwin: yeah, I'm triggering a mousedown now, but that has implications for other plugins listening for that event
[17:01:15] <k1t_> And you should try just asking your question instead of asking to ask
[17:01:16] <k1t_> :P
[17:01:21] <k1t_> it helps
[17:01:22] <k1t_> hehe
[17:01:37] <bleathem> Eviltwin: and just adding the class, you lose out on all the selection logic (ctrl click etc) and the animation (ui-selecting)
[17:02:00] <LindsayMac> k1t_:  I havent asked to ask once...
[17:02:11] <k1t_> okie excuse me than
[17:05:33] <defaultro> is data-method an html5 tag?
[17:06:15] <coldhead> http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[17:06:39] <defaultro> hi coldhead, glad to see you again
[17:06:44] <coldhead> data-anything is html5, for a certain semantic interpretation of "is"
[17:06:59] <coldhead> cf. bill clinton
[17:07:22] <defaultro> got it
[17:08:03] <defaultro> data-method is not there
[17:08:35] <Slugge> its not a tag though is it? its more like a value
[17:08:42] <Slugge> data-method=""
[17:08:42] <defaultro> it's a tag
[17:08:47] <defaultro> yup, like that
[17:09:02] <coldhead> it's an attribute
[17:09:09] <defaultro> k
[17:09:10] <Slugge> yeh cause tags are <> :P
[17:09:15] <Slugge> just sayin ^^^^
[17:09:22] <defaultro> it's inside <a>
[17:09:34] <defaultro> oh ok, yeah attributes
[17:09:48] <coldhead> <p data-anything="aids">lol</p> // $('p').data('anything') === 'aids';
[17:09:49] <Slugge> so whats ur question about it?
[17:10:17] <defaultro> just wondering what it is and how it works
[17:10:27] <defaultro> i inspected it using firebug
[17:10:28] <Slugge> http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[17:11:18] <Slugge> its used for storing
[17:12:12] <LindsayMac> Im gonna ask again .. only because there's active folks in here now.. but im not trying to flood..
[17:12:19] <Slugge> so say u have 2 different lists and one is food and other is drinks u can do data-name="food"
[17:12:30] <LindsayMac> I am having issues with a jquery plugin somehow effecting hte ability for me to set a background image as fixed
[17:13:09] <LindsayMac> The live example can be seen here by viewing it with your user agent set to iphone and your window small http://bscdeveloper.com/millwrights/#
[17:13:26] <LindsayMac> Ultimately I would like the background of the <article> to stay fixed like here http://jsfiddle.net/agtEd/1/
[17:14:45] <LindsayMac> and I silenced the crowd again L:(
[17:17:28] <defaultro> hmmm, can't find the click event for this kind of code. <a title="" href="#" data-method="createplace">Create a new place</a>
[17:17:52] <defaultro> although I see the string createplace in another .js file
[17:21:15] <Slugge> and u sure its not targeted by any other attributes or the text itself?
[17:21:34] <defaultro> ah, I found out how data-method was used :D
[17:21:51] <defaultro> .attr('data-method')
[17:21:55] <defaultro> you are right :)
[17:22:13] <defaultro> it referred to it and the value of it got assigned to a variable
[17:22:16] <defaultro> createplace
[17:22:29] <Slugge> :)
[17:22:48] <defaultro> now, there is a switch statement. The first case is case "createplace" :)
[17:23:32] <Slugge> tbh, im not completely sure what the real use of data-methods are at all, so if u find please share :P
[17:23:45] <Slugge> i just know its used for storing, but not how that storing actually works
[17:23:47] <defaultro> looks like it was just created as a variable
[17:24:00] <defaultro> yes, that's what i thought too, just for storing
[17:24:17] <Slugge> but does it store through sessions or cookies?
[17:24:26] <defaultro> no
[17:24:54] <Slugge> i really dont see the use of it then, other then maybe using it so one can target it specifically
[17:25:26] <Slugge> just seems like one of those "why not" features :P
[17:25:48] <defaultro> :)
[17:26:06] <defaultro> i'm scared, the person who is building our web left the company today
[17:26:20] <defaultro> he is a very deep javascript/jquery guy
[17:27:06] <Slugge> im also scared, ive been unemployed for 2 months! :O
[17:27:36] <defaultro> oh, i'm sorry
[17:27:40] <Slugge> currently doing an assignment for potential employer though, so fingers crossed!
[17:28:04] <Slugge> im newly educated though, and not in web, which is where i want to work, so im just happy with companies even showing interest so
[17:28:13] <defaultro> nice
[17:29:06] <defaultro> i'm stepping over his code now via firebug and I couldn't understand the function he is using
[17:30:14] <Slugge> aaand thats why good commenting of code = gold
[17:30:41] <defaultro> there are no comments
[17:30:53] <defaultro> i understand some
[17:30:56] <Slugge> disastrous tbh
[17:31:22] <LindsayMac> anyone wanna take a look at my fixed BG issue?
[17:32:36] <Slugge> i gotta comment just to understand my own code :P
[17:32:45] <ericelliott> What's your favorite jQuery / JavaScript blog?
[17:33:17] <fris> http://tympanus.net/codrops/
[17:33:18] <defaultro> k
[17:33:40] <LindsayMac> it seems that the ios doesnt support fixed background positions?! WTF
[17:33:49] <defaultro> i wish there was an ide that allows us to step over in multiple languages
[17:35:43] <LindsayMac> has anyone managed to hack a fixed BG image in ios?
[17:35:56] <ejcweb> I've got a selector. I am passed an element. How can I tell if that element is matched by the selector?
[17:38:58] <ajpiano> ejcweb: $(elem).is( selector )
[17:39:24] <ajpiano> Slugge: the point of data attributes is sometimes you have arbitrary pieces of data that don't have "semantic" value in html
[17:39:26] <defaultro> folks, need help on this code specifically after the succes function. http://pastebin.com/67763Tqr
[17:39:32] <ajpiano> however you need them to make your application work properly
[17:40:08] <ajpiano> Slugge: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide17
[17:40:17] <ejcweb> ajpiano: Thanks. And is there a way to see if the element is a child of one of the elements referenced by the selector? (ie. in a CSS inheritance sense?)
[17:40:54] <defaultro> ah, if it has 2 values, it sets the attribute
[17:41:00] <ajpiano> $(selector).find( elem ).length
[17:45:32] <defaultro> what does this mean? $('<script>')? Why is it not like this, $('#script')?
[17:46:02] <ajpiano> if you pass a string of html to jquery it creates a new element
[17:46:11] <defaultro> k
[17:46:12] <ajpiano> it's creating a new script element, not referencing an element with id script
[17:46:14] <ericelliott> defaultro: The first one is creating a new script, the second one is selecting an element with an id with the value "script"
[17:46:32] <defaultro> ok
[17:47:06] <defaultro> i'm currently stepping over this code. I should be able to console.log the value right?
[17:47:11] <defaultro> the r param?
[17:49:10] <ajpiano> defaultro: this is pretty odd stuff here
[17:49:23] <ajpiano> what is $(id).get(0).text supposed to be doing
[17:49:36] <defaultro> i don't know. Our contractor wrote it
[17:49:55] <ajpiano> this looks like someone is trying to do something really strange with js templates
[17:50:01] <defaultro> yes
[17:50:19] <defaultro> the url value is pointing to an html file which is a template
[17:50:31] <ajpiano> as in, trying to like, force it into a script tag so the template lives in a script tag
[17:50:35] <ajpiano> which is completley superfluous
[17:50:38] <ajpiano> imo
[17:50:47] <defaultro> k
[17:51:01] <defaultro> i really don't know why he makes things so complex
[17:51:12] <defaultro> everybody knows he is javascript/jquery god
[17:51:12] <ajpiano> you could just success: function(data) { templates[name] = compileTemplate( data ); }
[17:51:17] <ejcweb> ajpiano: If my selector, buttons = $('.btn'), matches three buttons, and then I click one button and have the element through e.currentTarget, buttons.find(e.currentTarget) returns nothing. What should I be doing to see that the button is referenced by the buttons selector?
[17:51:36] <defaultro> maybe, he wants the other people have a hard time decoding his code
[17:51:39] <ajpiano> where compileTemplate is whatever template lib you use
[17:51:44] <defaultro> especially me who is new in jquery
[17:51:45] <ajpiano> ejcweb: hm, what version of jquery are you using
[17:51:47] <defaultro> k
[17:51:58] <ejcweb> (ie. I want to check in my click handler if the element is a button)
[17:52:28] <ajpiano> ejcweb: $(e.target).closest(".btn").length would probably do the trick
[17:52:45] <ejcweb> ajpiano: version 1.7.1
[17:53:49] <defaultro> what is this code? return { close:close }
[17:54:08] <ajpiano> ejcweb: are you trying to check if the currentTarget is one of the button elements selected, or if the currentTarget is *inside* any of the button elements selected
[17:54:26] <ajpiano> defaultro: it returns an object with a key called "close" with a rerference to whatever that variable "close" is
[17:54:28] <ajpiano> from the function
[17:54:51] <defaultro> ok
[17:55:04] <ejcweb> ajpiano: I want it to check both actually. The original selector could either be the elements themselves, or containers of the elements.
[17:55:29] <LindsayMac> I can not believe that iphones don't do background-attachment:fixed...
[17:55:43] <defaultro> do you think that sharing code can be grounds for termination? but javascript is downloadable
[17:56:02] <ajpiano> $(e.target).closest(".btn").length will do the trick in either case, i think, ejcweb
[17:56:09] <ajpiano> LindsayMac: i think you should start to believe it :(
[17:56:10] <ejcweb> ajpiano: Thanks :)
[17:56:22] <LindsayMac> I just.. i just... i just.. i dont wanna!
[17:56:34] <tw2113> scumbag iOS
[17:56:37] <ajpiano> defaultro: very rarely do people at people's jobs care about junior employees putting out context-free snippets of code to strangers so that they can learn how they work
[17:57:15] <tw2113> but i may steal defaultro's code and make an ubercool website that mimics facebook and make pennies of money!
[17:57:30] <defaultro> :)
[17:58:08] <defaultro> i wanted to share so I can learn and be able to support our app. But am I being selffish?
[17:58:10] <LindsayMac> So i guess i am officially going to tell the client NO after all this
[17:58:33] <tw2113> the more you share, the more you care
[17:58:35] <defaultro> selfish in terms of me learning
[18:00:39] <defaultro> k
[18:02:29] <defaultro> tell me guys if I understand how javascript parses a single line of code. Here is the code and wait for my analysis :)
[18:03:05] <defaultro> var p = getModulePath(moduleName).join("/") + '.js';
[18:03:45] <defaultro> here is my analysis. it completes the getModulePath first which actually returns a result. On the result, the join func will be applied. Then concatenated to .js string
[18:04:04] <defaultro> so from left to right
[18:04:24] <defaultro> am I right?
[18:04:29] <ajpiano> pretty much, yep
[18:04:33] <defaultro> cool :D
[18:04:34] <ajpiano> getModulePath obviously returns an array
[18:04:42] <ajpiano> which whne you call join on it, returns another string
[18:04:47] <defaultro> got it
[18:05:00] <defaultro> sweet. thanks a bunch
[18:05:51] <w00tner> im trying to retrieve data from a json object.. is this wrong ? data[' + value.id + '].titulo
[18:06:00] <w00tner> the value.id is storing ok
[18:06:08] <ajpiano> wat
[18:06:08] <b-ot> What are those? Is this the morning when we wake up? What's a planet?
[18:06:19] <ajpiano> w00tner: data[ value.id ]
[18:06:33] <ajpiano> not sure what the quotes and concat operators are all about
[18:12:50] <w00tner> hey ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/LkAY8/
[18:13:00] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[18:13:01] <w00tner> if i set it manually it works perfect
[18:13:10] <w00tner> morning mfoxdogg
[18:13:35] <w00tner> still thursday here
[18:13:42] <w00tner> not even night
[18:17:07] <w00tner> help ? help ?!
[18:17:45] <ajpiano> w00tner: there's not enough context there for me to somehow know why "setting it manually" is any different than what you're doing otherwise
[18:18:09] <Eviltwin> Not to mention it looks like you left off a bunch of closing brackets and stuff
[18:18:25] <Eviltwin> And you don't have any example HTML so we can't see it in action
[18:23:24] <defaultro> this php code most likely is being called by javascript. It echos a json string. echo '{"error":"true"}';
[18:23:42] <defaultro> now I need to hunt down that javascript file
[18:26:12] <ajpiano> defaultro: if you are showing your xhr traffic in dev tools
[18:26:22] <ajpiano> it will show what line of js in what file is making the xhr
[18:26:38] <defaultro> how do I do that?
[18:26:46] <defaultro> i am also not familiar with xhr
[18:26:59] <ajpiano> what browser are you using
[18:27:02] <defaultro> i am using firebug. Is dev tools different
[18:27:05] <defaultro> Firefox
[18:27:13] <ajpiano> hm
[18:27:13] <defaultro> i also have web dev tools
[18:28:13] <defaultro> on top left, I clickd Firefox and it showed a drop down window. I see Web Developer and many things under it
[18:28:58] <Slugge> web developer is very different from firebug :)
[18:29:15] <defaultro> yup
[18:29:18] <Slugge> its very good for css stuff atleast, the "outline block elementals" is very good for alignment
[18:29:23] <defaultro> ok
[18:29:38] <defaultro> the file is upload.php and i found it on two .js scripts
[18:29:42] <ajpiano> hm i don't know if you can get a line number, i feel like i may have been making up the thing about the line number
[18:29:57] <ajpiano> defaultro: but if you go to the Net tab in firebug you can see all the xhr traffic
[18:30:08] <defaultro> i used find . -name '*.js' -exec grep upload.php {} /dev/null \;
[18:30:12] <defaultro> glad i know unix
[18:36:55] <w00tner> ajpiano can i pm you ?
[18:37:09] <ajpiano> i am somewhat otherwise occupied atm
[18:38:05] <defaultro> what is $form mean in $form.find('.waitimage').find('#waiticon').remove();
[18:38:32] <w00tner> ok, thanks.
[18:40:06] <ajpiano> w00tner: it is likely that if you ask your questiona nd provide more detail, someone or me will be able to figure it out
[18:40:58] <ajpiano> there's nothing about your problem that requires a pm
[18:41:14] <ansdev1> hi, if cookie_httponly is set.. but the cookie is still sent in $.post calls... is there any way to get the cookie using jquery for use elsewhere?
[18:43:36] <w00tner> im trying to append dynamic data from a json file into a div ,, so i  stored the data-id from the element and alert it fine. it works. but when i try to pass it to the function it just doesnt work
[18:43:37] <w00tner> http://jsfiddle.net/LkAY8/1/
[18:43:49] <w00tner> i works if i set data[1].descripcion
[18:44:01] <defaultro> is DOM a built in word? The code is var trigger = DOM.find(".some_trigger_string"); then trigger.upload("rm/upload.php");
[18:44:11] <w00tner> but not if i try data[valueID).description
[18:44:25] <w00tner> or data[ value.id ).description
[18:44:34] <bung> defaultro: isnt it $(document) or something
[18:44:45] <defaultro> no
[18:44:59] <defaultro> on top is, I found it, var DOM = $(attachmentHtml);
[18:45:04] <defaultro> now sure what that is
[18:45:29] <defaultro> ah
[18:45:39] <defaultro> it's literally a huge html string
[18:46:00] <defaultro> var attachmentHtml = ' ................................................. html tags and so on';
[18:46:26] <bung> regarding your other question about $form, thats just a variable
[18:46:32] <defaultro> ok
[18:46:46] <bung> someone probably did something like var $form = $('#myform');
[18:46:58] <defaultro> got it
[18:46:58] <bung> people add $ to the start to give you a clue its a jQuery object
[18:47:02] <defaultro> i'll look for it
[18:47:13] <defaultro> k
[18:49:14] <defaultro> can't believe, our contractor loves coding a lot. Removing an uploaded file uses a complex code
[18:49:33] <defaultro> it's making me dizzy
[18:50:41] <defaultro> why do you think our app was written almost 95% jquery/javascript rather than php
[18:51:02] <bung> because not everyone likes page loads
[18:51:08] <defaultro> got it
[18:51:13] <defaultro> ajax calls
[18:51:18] <defaultro> i actually love ajax calls
[18:51:28] <bung> are you ESL?
[18:51:35] <defaultro> what is esl?
[18:51:41] <bung> english as a second language
[18:51:44] <defaultro> yes
[18:51:48] <bung> nods
[18:52:11] <defaultro> you figured it out :) which part told you english isn't my native language
[18:53:08] <bung> nothing specific... anyway back on topic before we get kicked..
[18:53:22] <defaultro> :)
[18:59:11] <acconrad> Could someone explain the difference between $.ajax().done().fail() and $.promise() done() fail()?
[18:59:32] <acconrad> I'm really not getting why you need promise() when you can just do $.ajax().done().fail().always()
[19:02:54] <w00tner> why cannot i set a data.id to an element = 0 ??
[19:02:59] <w00tner> it gives me another number
[19:03:08] <w00tner> {
[19:03:08] <w00tner>   "empresa": "Come Torta",
[19:03:08] <w00tner>   "id": 0,
[19:03:17] <w00tner> when i retrieve it it shows like
[19:03:44] <w00tner> 1
[19:04:04] <acconrad> w00tner: what is the code you are using to retrieve the data?
[19:04:16] <w00tner> oh it works
[19:04:22] <w00tner> typo sorry
[19:34:05] <HAPPYFUNBRO> is there a event.pageX for DIV elements?
[19:36:37] <oojacoboo> if I have a global click event that I don't want to bubble, how can I prevent this?
[19:36:53] <oojacoboo> I have cases where it's still bubbling when returning false in the bound click event
[19:37:09] <oojacoboo> I've also tried to stopPropagation, but haven't had much luck
[19:37:11] <oojacoboo> any clues?
[19:40:05] <oojacoboo> I'm guessing it's b/c I'm binding to document.body and it's having to bubble up for the bound event
[19:41:03] <oojacoboo> the API docs suggest returning false, which of course isn't working, how can you determine the event bubbling order.  I'd figure it was determined by the DOM, or is it by the element bound instead?
[19:49:33] <HAPPYFUNBRO> is there a event.pageX for DIV elements?
[19:49:55] <oojacoboo> pageX?
[19:49:57] <oojacoboo> what is that?
[19:51:15] <HAPPYFUNBRO> it determines the location of a mouse click on a page
[19:51:28] <HAPPYFUNBRO> relative to the top left side of the page
[19:52:20] <oojacoboo> how is that an event?
[19:52:26] <oojacoboo> like… what event occurs?
[19:53:24] <oojacoboo> HAPPYFUNBRO, would the event not be onMouseDown or onClick?
[19:53:46] <HAPPYFUNBRO> oojacoboo http://api.jquery.com/event.pageX/
[19:54:24] <oojacoboo> ah
[19:54:39] <oojacoboo> HAPPYFUNBRO, so, could you just get the position of the DIV and do a little math?
[19:54:44] <oojacoboo> or use onMouseEnter?
[20:01:20] <HAPPYFUNBRO> hm
[20:01:24] <HAPPYFUNBRO> looks like math
[20:01:32] <HAPPYFUNBRO> *looks like I'll be doing some math
[20:01:54] <astropirate> HAPPYFUNBRO, high five
[20:02:12] <HAPPYFUNBRO> is there a method that gets an element's location (in pixels) relative to the left border of a page?
[20:02:21] <astropirate> HAPPYFUNBRO, offset
[20:07:16] <HAPPYFUNBRO> thank you
[20:07:50] <HAPPYFUNBRO> that's the ticket!
[20:23:34] <martisj> if i want to toggle the visibility of an element with jquery how do i do that most elegantly?
[20:23:54] <martisj> this is my selector: 		$('.comments_container li').livequery("mouseenter", function(e){ 			$(this).children(".comment_tools").css('visibility', 'visible'); });
[20:26:29] <daevski> Hey everyone. I think I have a simple callback issue in this code snippet, but I'm rather new to the concept and can't figure it out. http://pastebin.com/YWnSU7v7 -- when clicking and running the functions again, iSwapActive is still true.
[20:26:30] <clouder_> martisj, jquery has a toggle function iirc
[20:26:46] <martisj> that toggles display: none and display: inline
[20:27:06] <NexHD> hy
[20:27:09] <martisj> it makes the surrounding elements act funky i.e. move a little down when hovering over the element
[20:27:25] <cody--> can anyone help me figure out how to make callFunctionHere only fire when all ajaxs are finished in this example: https://gist.github.com/5a25e690360310c05ab8
[20:27:35] <NexHD> martisj can i ask you something?
[20:29:40] <NexHD> how i resolve the execute only one time .after event in a if statament
[20:29:58] <NexHD> ?
[20:32:26] <shoky> cody--: $.when.apply($, ajaxs).then(....
[20:32:47] <shoky> you need to supply a context as first argument to apply
[20:32:56] <clouder_> martisj, well if you are displaying or not displaying elements on a page things will probably move around
[20:32:57] <oojacoboo> OMG browser bugs driving me mad
[20:33:11] <cody--> shoky still doesn't work
[20:33:15] <oojacoboo> anyone experienced unreliable event.target behavior?
[20:33:24] <oojacoboo> anyone _else_
[20:33:40] <shoky> cody--: does your array get populated correctly..
[20:33:51] <shoky> ah
[20:34:25] <shoky> cody--: you are pushing things into your array only inside callbacks to other requests.. of course the array wont be populated yet by the time the main $.each is finished
[20:34:42] <daevski> Hey everyone. I think I have a simple callback issue in this code snippet, but I'm rather new to the concept and can't figure it out. http://pastebin.com/YWnSU7v7 -- when clicking and running the functions again, isSwapActive is still true. it's supposed to be set to false at the end of imgSwap()
[20:36:26] <cody--> ya, i kinda figured thats what was happening, camae here to see if anyone had any idea of a way to do it
[20:36:29] <martisj> clouder_: yeha i reckon visibility is better, as this produces the result i want :)
[20:36:41] <martisj> just wondering whether there are any nasty side effects i don't know about
[20:37:01] <shoky> cody--: if you want that last line to execute only when the "outer" loop of requests is done, you'd need another outer $.when.apply
[20:37:27] <cody--> ill try that
[20:38:25] <daevski> Nvm all. I think I just fixed it. Brought the fadeOut() with the callback out of the imgSwap() function and just at the end of the .click function. :)
[20:39:04] <cody--> shoky, think that worked
[20:39:07] <cody--> seems nasty but it works
[20:39:17] <daevski> Carry on.. bye :)
[20:40:12] <clouder_> I wonder if daevski knew he was missing a }) at the end of this pastie :|
[20:40:48] <shoky> cody--: you don't need to push to an array btw.. you can use $.map like this:  https://gist.github.com/32deefeae8b3b01156a2
[20:41:59] <NexHD> how to prevents double event registration?
[20:42:30] <cody--> not to sure what .map does using an array and pushing each call onto the array made more sense, guess i should look at .map
[20:43:12] <shoky> cody--: it loops over your array (like .each) and pushes the return values to the returned array
[20:43:35] <shoky> cody--: but just need to be careful in jquery with the order of the arguments
[20:44:12] <tash> anyone used DataTables' server-side processing?
[20:45:03] <oojacoboo> tash, what data tables are you referring to?
[20:45:16] <tash> http://datatables.net/
[20:45:35] <oojacoboo> cool
[20:45:52] <oojacoboo> why wouldn't you just modify with the json set?
[20:46:07] <oojacoboo> or are you talking about very large data sets where you'd need to get a new dataset from the server?
[20:46:27] <oojacoboo> and if that's the case, why would you need/want datatables.net?
[20:46:59] <tash> I have a specific question about DataTables. I'm already using it, I am not really looking for a discussion for/against it.  Just wondering if anyone in here has used it.
[20:47:06] <tash> specifically speaking, server-side processing
[20:47:11] <oojacoboo> lol
[20:47:13] <oojacoboo> g/l
[20:48:07] <oojacoboo> tash, the answer is likely no to your question b/c it defeats the purpose of it in the first place
[20:48:17] <oojacoboo> data tables in js are so you DO NOT have to query the server again
[20:48:46] <jayar> anyone understand why this works in firefox and IE but not in chrome... it used to work but all of a sudden it shows the picture then just "closes" -> http://www.stirfryproductions.com
[20:54:38] <cody--> thanks shoky :)
[20:55:28] <abjorn> coldhead my brudda
[20:57:33] <jayar> i get this error but its not used anywhere - Use of getAttributeNode() is deprecated. Use getAttribute() instead.
[21:04:05] <jayar> < sad panda
[21:04:17] <jayar> well, more frustrated panda
[21:06:04] <NexHD> jayar can i ask you something
[21:06:05] <NexHD> ???
[21:06:07] <NexHD> :D
[21:06:11] <jayar> of course
[21:06:23] <NexHD> do you know jquery?
[21:06:36] <jayar> not really
[21:06:42] <jayar> thats why im here
[21:06:53] <NexHD> i need a little help ;)
[21:07:15] <jayar> i'll try
[21:07:22] <jayar> i know it enough to play with it
[21:07:57] <NexHD> i need to prevent double .after event
[21:09:25] <jayar> is it double submitting something?
[21:10:11] <NexHD> i have in a form
[21:10:13] <NexHD> an error
[21:10:31] <NexHD> and he show for many times
[21:10:48] <shoky> jayar: you're creating a new <img> element and checking its width before its even loaded, that may be the problem
[21:11:14] <shoky> jayar: so its width might be reported as 0 and that's what you set the width of ps_image_wrapper to
[21:11:29] <shoky> jayar: time to console.log stuff
[21:11:46] <NexHD> shoky can you help me a little?
[21:11:48] <jayar> yea i've been watchin console in firefox
[21:11:55] <jayar> but i didnt catch that, thanx shoky
[21:12:23] <shoky> NexHD: .after is not an event
[21:12:33] <NexHD> but what it?
[21:12:41] <NexHD> is?
[21:12:46] <shoky> a method
[21:13:00] <r500> how do i get the selected/checked nodes for jquery treeview. http://code.google.com/p/jquery-treeview/downloads/list
[21:13:00] <shoky> that adds a dom element after another..
[21:13:27] <NexHD> and how i can do to show only one time?
[21:13:35] <NexHD> that after method
[21:13:42] <tw2113> *eyes shoky with a spork*
[21:13:45] <shoky> NexHD: call it only one time. you won't get any better help if you dont ask a better question
[21:14:00] <shoky> (and learning english would help too)
[21:14:42] <shoky> *steals tw2113's spork*
[21:14:45] <shoky> i've always wanted one
[21:14:47] <shoky> what is it?
[21:16:13] <shoky> jayar: actuallly you have an image preloader it looks like, so maybe that's not the issue, donno. but fact is you are animating the width to 0px somewhere
[21:16:22] <tw2113> use your imagination :)
[21:16:40] <shoky> some hardcore sporking action here
[21:17:18] <jayar> yea its just wierd, it completely worked before, now all of a sudden doesnt
[21:17:29] <jayar> and it still works in IE & firefox
[21:18:24] <shoky> jayar: add a console.log of the width of the newImage ... that'll clear it up hopefully
[21:18:26] <jayar> and yea i was just lookin where it sets the width of the wrapper and it would be 0 if there wasnt an image loader... maybe somethings wrong with loading the other images
[21:18:57] <shoky> if it logs 0 then yea there might be a problem with the preloading
[21:19:23] <shoky> hmm though
[21:19:39] <shoky> once its cached that would've stopped happening

[21:49:52] <miCSu> somewhy it doesn't fade to the middle but at the bottom of the page, even though chrome developer tools says it has top 50% height 944px and top-margin -472.5px.. any ideas?

[22:09:37] <shoky> miCSu: it also depends on where in the DOM that popup is
[22:13:14] <BitcoinDetective> ashermccauley.com/test why isnt the scrollbar working with arrow keys and scroll wheel?
[22:20:22] <shoky> BitcoinDetective: the wheel works for me. and the keys don't work because the plugin doesn't support keys
[22:20:36] <BitcoinDetective> Cool ty
[22:20:42] <BitcoinDetective> I dont have a mouse wheel :P
[22:20:54] <BitcoinDetective> So i was sitting the smashing my arrow keys

[23:01:34] <ejcweb> I've got a tour of my web app, which points to buttons for the user to click, with explanation text. During the tour, I want to disable all other buttons/links, so that they can only do the action I am showing them. What is the best way to do this? Ideally I don't want to have to change too much DOM, or have to give the buttons disabled styles.
[23:14:00] <r500> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12103203/how-to-get-selected-node-including-parent-nodes-for-jquery-treeview can some one help me on this plz
[23:17:32] <coldhead> i don't know treeview sorry r500
[23:17:46] <r500> hmm... :(
[23:18:44] <coldhead> if you're getting no joy here or on stack overflow maybe contact the authors?
[23:18:50] <vectorshelve> this jquery function works in jsfiddle but the same thing doesnt work in the firebug console -> http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/23/
[23:19:12] <r500> i found this https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/dynatree/_-P_uqsy4RI coldhead
[23:20:15] <r500> the last realease  of jquery treeview was way back.. 2010
[23:23:03] <mazzachre> A strange thing... When I add elements via jquery to the dom, it seems thet the "text-overflow: ellipsis;" clause in my css have no effect... Anyone else noticed this? Or am I doing something wrong? (Windows XP, Firefox 14.0.1, and ellipsis works from elements that were these when the document was rendered)
[23:24:26] <xdjuj__> vectorshelve what do you mean ? Is this function work in your page ?
[23:25:22] <xdjuj__> Firebug is a testing/debugging tool no ? :) I don't understand your problem.
[23:25:29] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: its working in jsfiddle..as u can see... but in my actual html page.. which has the same html strucuture.. its failing...not working although line by line the jquery code in console does return the dom element
[23:26:39] <xdjuj__> Have you jQuery loaded on your page ?
[23:28:23] <coldhead> mazzachre: that has never happened to me
[23:28:44] <coldhead> do you have all the other CSS props you need to make ellipsese work?
[23:28:55] <xdjuj__> vectorshelve I've tried your code, in one page I was working on :) And that works very fine, so I'm pretty sure you haven't load jQuery on your page vectorshelve :)
[23:29:04] <coldhead> white-space: nowrap and overflow:hidden ?
[23:29:27] <mazzachre> coldhead: Hmmm... I didn't think it was quite normal... I am not sure what happens... Let me test in jsfiddle...
[23:30:01] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: I plan to make this an chrome extension to the app I am working on :)
[23:30:11] <xdjuj__> (damned… How can some people still be under Windows XP… ?? More thant 10 years old OS… just incredible :p)
[23:30:42] <Cork> xdjuj__: cause there machines can't handle win7 (not to mention vista)
[23:30:46] <Haprog> better than vista atleast
[23:30:53] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: how can I add the css part inside the jquery code ? http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/25/ Cork help with this
[23:31:05] <xdjuj__> Cork then there's a lot of Linux distribution :)
[23:31:24] <xdjuj__> 10 years ago it was Mac OS X 10.0
[23:31:25] <xdjuj__> ...
[23:31:27] <Cork> vectorshelve: you can't express psudo selectors inline
[23:31:33] <jarco> xdjuj__, how can some people still be running on windows!
[23:31:48] <xdjuj__> I can't even imagine to work on Mac OS 10.6 today so 10.0…. :p
[23:31:53] <vectorshelve> Cork: so you mean I cant incorporate it into the jquery
[23:32:09] <Cork> you need to use hover events
[23:32:18] <Cork> and set the hover values there
[23:32:32] <Cork> vectorshelve: though that said you SHOULD keep your css in the css file
[23:32:36] <Cork> it doesn't belong inside js
[23:33:30] <mazzachre> coldhead: LOL! OK I am just stupid... Took me 15min or so yesterday not finding my problem, now it turned out it was obvious... Remember to put overflow hidden! the reason it is not ellipisoid is that it is not cut off, and the reason I didn't see that was white text on white background outside my element...
[23:34:07] <ordinaryman09> guys, how do you make a text input display like select options when clicked?
[23:34:08] <vectorshelve> Cork: hmm... so while building the chrome extension I would have an extra file :)
[23:34:45] <Cork> ugg.. your still on about that damn extension...
[23:34:56] <coldhead> good work mazzachre  :)
[23:34:58] <vectorshelve> jsut in case if anyone is good with css... can I have http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/25/ for my white frame... a thin black line as border to it.. ?? so that on a white background the border would higlight the thin black border of image frame will help
[23:35:36] <xdjuj__> ordinaryman09 maybe by switching input to select when you focus the input ?
[23:36:13] <ordinaryman09> any examples u can point to?
[23:36:32] <xdjuj__> vectorshelve I really don't understand anything to any of your problems :)
[23:36:38] <xdjuj__> I've no thin line
[23:37:14] <xdjuj__> Why don't you work on your own server instead of jsfiddle ? :)
[23:37:27] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: when you hover over the image as u see in the css.. I have given it a white frame... I want to add a thin black border to it
[23:37:31] <xdjuj__> In CSS you should reset the images img{border:0;outline:0;}
[23:38:05] <xdjuj__> Ha ! You want to ADD
[23:38:07] <xdjuj__> ok
[23:38:48] <xdjuj__> .css{'border','1px solid black'}
[23:40:32] <xdjuj__> vectorshelve ==> http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/30/
[23:59:54] <Tram> Goodmorning all
