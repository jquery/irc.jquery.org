[03:10:18] <nindustries> Hi guys, so I got the following code that scrolls a div. It is a CPU hog tough. (.animate()) Any suggestions ? http://pastie.org/pastes/10793144/text
[03:11:23] <systemfault> Add a throttle to it
[03:12:13] <systemfault> Something like that: https://lodash.com/docs#throttle
[03:12:59] <nindustries> hm, including a whole JS lib just for throttling..
[03:13:18] <systemfault> nindustries: You don't need to
[03:13:22] <nindustries> oh?
[03:14:47] <systemfault> Hmm, I guess you're not using commonjs modules, right?
[03:15:23] <systemfault> https://remysharp.com/2010/07/21/throttling-function-calls You could copy that code
[03:15:36] <systemfault> You want the throttle function, not debounce for that case.
[03:15:42] <systemfault> So scroll a little bit
[03:54:08] <Serg_Penguin> how can I convert return data of one promise/deferred to another with function and return it ? how this operation is correctly named, for Google ? I want to do some work on AJAX result, to hide details and show interface
[03:54:41] <Gloomy> Hi :)à
[03:55:25] <Gloomy> I have this little snippet that is supposed to duplicate a text input and clear it's contents, however the clearing doesn't work, anyone sees what's wrong? http://pastebin.com/0iUDGKRF
[04:01:22] <Gloomy> The duplication works but it also duplicates any text that was inserted in the textbox, shouldn't the ".val('')" remove that ?
[04:06:26] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/y7jpcodg/ take a look at this Gloomy
[04:06:52] <Kartagis> lines 5 and 6
[04:08:59] <Gloomy> Kartagis : I'll try that way, but why shouldn't chaining work?
[04:10:28] <nindustries> systemfault: thx, added
[04:11:03] <Kartagis> Gloomy: I think it's because you left out first()
[04:37:59] <Sourcey> Simple example on removeClass on pageload. Why is this not working? https://jsfiddle.net/kucamh4p/
[04:48:47] <Cork> Sourcey: https://jsfiddle.net/kucamh4p/1/
[04:48:55] <Cork> cause you didn't load jquery
[04:50:27] <Sourcey> ah, yes. But I found the problem. Was caused by doing av if statement in PHP before the removeclass was called
[05:27:22] <suexec> Does anyone here use jQuery Mobile and have implemented http://glide.jedrzejchalubek.com/ (Glide.js) ?

[08:58:57] <newbie975> Hello people!
[09:00:55] <suexec> What has http://api.jquerymobile.com/jquery.mobile.loadpage/ been replaced with ?
[09:04:06] <R13ose> Devrim: you have to put the code within the <script> tags in the Javascript area in jsfiddle first.
[09:04:39] <Sangeet> hello people
[09:05:26] <R13ose> suexec: read the note on that page.
[09:05:51] <Sangeet> what should be the reason that i am no more able to add <section> in the single page layout?when ever i add any new <section> it is just overlap the one by  the available section
[09:06:10] <Devrim> R13ose done :D I copied it from w3school when I was messing around with for loops ^^

[09:08:34] <Devrim> is it just me?
[09:08:40] <Devrim> or is something borked

[09:09:44] <Devrim> yeah taplar
[09:09:58] <Devrim> I copied the <script> part to the javascript part
[09:10:00] <R13ose> Devrim: if you changed the code, please update this.
[09:10:05] <taplar> ^^^
[09:10:15] <Devrim> R13ose for some reason I can't save
[09:10:28] <Devrim> I tried making a new one in chrome and firefox but both give me no url

[09:11:36] <suexec> R13ose, I am trying to use that .. $("#main_content").pagecontainer("change","pages/" + page ... and I keep getting cannot call methods on pagecontainer prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'change'
[09:12:39] <R13ose> Devrim: are you sure you only copied the code within the <script> and not the <script> too?
[09:12:48] <Devrim> yeah I did R13ose
[09:12:58] <Devrim> when I copy the code to javascript the site refuses to save
[09:13:35] <R13ose> taplar: any ideas on Devrim's problem?
[09:13:46] <R13ose> suexec: does this page help you: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22457764/issues-with-mobile-loadpage-and-external-page-in-jquery-mobile
[09:14:39] <suexec> R13ose, yes it does - thank you very much ! :)
[09:14:46] <R13ose> suexec: you're welcome
[09:14:49] <hellyeah> taplar: can i show you my last effort?
[09:15:27] <R13ose> seems no one is willing to help me.
[09:15:42] <hellyeah> R13ose:  what is your problem?
[09:15:52] <taplar> R13ose:  yeah

[09:17:22] <Devrim> why? :D you too?
[09:17:26] <zpzpzpzpz> yes
[09:17:59] <zpzpzpzpz> taplar:  i finished my work
[09:19:14] <suexec> R13ose, no content is displayed though .. any idea what might be causing that ?
[09:19:41] <R13ose> suexec: No errors or warnings anymore?
[09:19:48] <suexec> R13ose, no errors or warning ! :)
[09:20:04] <R13ose> suexec: well, I can't tell what you are doing without code :)
[09:20:23] * zpzpzpzpz taplar  forgot me xD
[09:21:31] <taplar> i'm still trying to get fiddle to work so i can share this
[09:21:57] <taplar> i feel like i've seen this before, but i forget what the fix is
[09:23:11] <suexec> R13ose, http://pastebin.com/rZre2Dj5 that's my loader code. On index.php, I have document ready and then I do: loadPage("LogIn.php");
[09:24:26] <R13ose> suexec: Everything is setup correctly so you are able to run that function?
[09:26:09] <neo12> http://pastebin.com/2CEgHbWF
[09:26:17] <zpzpzpzpz> taplar:  what is the problem?
[09:26:24] <taplar> R13ose: https://jsfiddle.net/yocky7Ls/4/
[09:26:42] <R13ose> zpzpzpzpz: did you look at mine?
[09:26:43] <taplar> stupid fiddle won't update sometimes.  cleared my cache and finally got it to play nice
[09:27:23] <zpzpzpzpz> R13ose:  no
[09:27:29] <neo12> any suggestions?
[09:27:44] <Devrim> thanks taplar >:)
[09:27:48] <R13ose> taplar: what is this suppose to do?
[09:28:27] <taplar> it's mapping the buttons to new elements and returning them.  Also doing the binding.  And then at the end it appends all the buttons to the existing element
[09:28:54] <R13ose> neo12: is the symbol an array?
[09:28:56] <zpzpzpzpz> i think they add button to the p with name, id etc.
[09:29:03] <suexec> R13ose, it's running, yes. access.log show the page being fetched as well.. but I don't get any content
[09:29:11] <taplar> yeah i left some stuff out, but you see how it works
[09:29:21] <R13ose> taplar: where is the problem?
[09:29:26] <neo12> R13ose: I've included the json file at bottom
[09:29:32] <neo12> its a list
[09:29:45] <suexec> R13ose, I just get a long grey bar along the side of my container
[09:29:45] <R13ose> neo12: I know but are you trying to get ME to print out?
[09:29:46] <taplar> R13ose: your original issue was that you were trying to concat jquery commands to an element
[09:29:47] <zpzpzpzpz> R13ose:  seems like dynamically building elements
[09:30:05] <taplar> and jquery wasn't even included in the fiddle
[09:30:10] <R13ose> suexec: maybe you should step through the coede
[09:30:18] <neo12> console.log(data.symbol[0].symbol) throws undefined
[09:30:32] <taplar> neo12: there is no direct symbol
[09:30:36] <zpzpzpzpz> neo12:  fiddle?
[09:30:45] <taplar> your structure shows it's data["1"].symbol
[09:30:49] <taplar> or another of the keys
[09:30:57] <neo12> let me try that
[09:31:02] <neo12> taplar
[09:31:15] <suexec> R13ose, What am I looking for?
[09:32:30] <R13ose> suexec: to see why this isn't working the way you want this to.
[09:32:41] <suexec> R13ose, :P
[09:32:47] <zpzpzpzpz> hey please choose smt from dropdown and radiobox and create datepickers select the date and do it like three or four time then click on of the pencil button and see what happens http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/nt4mtwr4/4/
[09:32:56] <zpzpzpzpz> any suggestion?
[09:35:07] <taplar> make a smaller fiddle hellyeah
[09:35:13] <R13ose> suexec: I am not sure on the outcome you are expecting.
[09:35:31] <suexec> R13ose, I want the html written in another page to be loaded into the div
[09:36:03] <zpzpzpzpz> taplar:  i finished my work
[09:36:04] <R13ose> suexec: is the div loading?
[09:36:30] <taplar> ?
[09:37:02] <zpzpzpzpz> it is between 423- 575
[09:37:15] <taplar> make a smaller fiddle
[09:37:19] <suexec> R13ose, the div is in my DOM by default. The content of the page I am loading does not appear to be placed in the <div>, no
[09:37:49] <zpzpzpzpz> anyway i need all functionalities :XD
[09:37:52] <zpzpzpzpz> i will try that
[09:38:22] <R13ose> suexec: you are trying to load everything into the id main_content?
[09:38:35] <suexec> R13ose, that is correct
[09:39:44] <R13ose> suexec: maybe printing out some variables into the console will help you understand what is happening.
[09:40:53] <suexec> R13ose, where could I print variables? My loadPage is executing with the correct arguments .. my apache access.log confirms the page is being fetched.. it's just not being displayed in the containing div that I have added a pagecontainer to
[09:41:12] <neo12> taplar: thats works but how would i loop through each of these?
[09:41:28] <taplar> it's not going to be easy, you got funky markup
[09:41:39] <taplar> why are you constructing it as an object on the outer most layer?
[09:41:46] <taplar> that should be an array
[09:42:25] <R13ose> suexec: does this help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23826774/jquery-mobile-pagecontainer-to-load-external-page-with-transition-effects
[09:43:33] <neo12> its something I just put together for testing purposes.
[09:43:47] <taplar> then if possible i'd say fix your markup
[09:43:56] <neo12> mock data
[09:44:04] <neo12> you mean the data file?
[09:44:22] <taplar> whatever is creating that json to be returned
[09:44:26] <R13ose> Any thoughts on my question?
[09:44:33] <neo12> i trote it myself
[09:44:36] <neo12> wrote*
[09:44:41] <taplar> ok, so fix it, :)
[09:45:39] <R13ose> Use this code: http://pastebin.com/PDphFPfr to make sure the video in the modal popup stops after I close?  Here is my site: http://www.yx3tv.com/ should popup onload.
[09:47:10] <suexec> R13ose, no difference :(
[09:47:18] <zpzpzpzpz> yeha

[09:54:01] <zpzpzpzpz> it took like 20 secs
[09:55:10] <suexec> R13ose, doesn't make sense. Is the jquery documentation wrong ?
[09:55:52] <R13ose> suexec: who knows but did that work?
[09:56:17] <suexec> R13ose, no
[09:56:20] <zpzpzpzpz> what is the issue_?
[09:56:25] <zpzpzpzpz> i wondered it
[09:56:35] <suexec> R13ose,  just an empty screen using that .. not even they bar thing
[10:00:16] <R13ose> suexec: this page has lots of examples and comments: https://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/03/26/jquery-mobile-page-events/  If that doesn't work, I am not sure.
[10:04:18] <Whirled> So I got sucked into reading about D3 and I am wondering if D3 is a substitute for jquery or if they work together or should I be reading abou this or is it just going to be confusing?
[10:08:04] <suexec> God dang this is annoying :p
[10:08:47] <suexec> R13ose, I have the exact same code as the examples (apart from me loading new documents, not divs), and f if it's working
[10:08:56] <R13ose> Whirled: http://timruffles.github.io/d3-for-jquery-people/#/ use the right arrow to move forward.
[10:09:20] <R13ose> suexec: are none of the examples working?

[10:19:08] <R13ose> suexec: you're welcome
[10:19:48] <cyjobes> Hello - How come when I assign a $('.someclass').on('click', do_something) to a set of radio buttons, the function runs the same amount of radio buttons I have, instead of just the once?
[10:21:21] <R13ose> dANOKELOFF: I am unsure what you are saying
[10:21:44] <R13ose> cyjobes: do all the radio buttons have the same class?
[10:23:01] <cyjobes> R13ose: Yes
[10:23:28] <albedoa> $('.someclase') selects all elements with .someclass
[10:23:34] <cyjobes> R13ose: I want the same function assigned to them all, but onely collect the currtly selected value
[10:24:07] <albedoa> https://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/ cyjobes
[10:24:12] <zpzpzpzpz> albedoa:  what do you want to select_
[10:24:13] <zpzpzpzpz> ?
[10:24:46] <zpzpzpzpz> ops sorry
[10:24:50] <albedoa> np
[10:25:01] <zpzpzpzpz> cyjobes:  you are doing global lookup
[10:25:29] <cyjobes> zpzpzpzpz: ???
[10:26:26] <zpzpzpzpz> cyjobes:  what do you want to do exactly?
[10:26:27] <albedoa> cyjobes you are selecting everything with that class
[10:26:40] <albedoa> see my link for how to select only selected items
[10:27:02] <zpzpzpzpz> $('.someclass:selected') may work
[10:27:24] <Aikar> hi - $('#foo select') vs $('#foo').find('select'). PhpStorm claims that the latter is more efficient. Is this true?
[10:28:04] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[10:28:32] <cyjobes> zpzpzpzpz: Yes, $('.someclass:selected') does work, but I'm curious why the functions runs as many times as it does, rather than just the once for the one click.
[10:28:34] <Aikar> interesting, thanks
[10:28:40] <zpzpzpzpz> assign selector to a variable in case you reuse it
[10:28:44] <Aikar> JQ cant auto optimize that?
[10:28:50] <Aikar> and break it up itself
[10:28:54] <taplar> it's not jq, it's sizzle
[10:28:57] <zpzpzpzpz> cyjobes:  if you do a fiddle
[10:28:58] <Aikar> ah
[10:29:05] <albedoa> seems like it should Aikar i agree
[10:29:08] <zpzpzpzpz> it is possible to help you more
[10:29:18] <albedoa> what is sizzle?
[10:29:26] <Aikar> the underlying lookup lib
[10:29:26] <cyjobes> fiddle?
[10:29:31] <zpzpzpzpz> jsfiddle
[10:29:34] <taplar> sizzle is the library jq uses for the dom selection operations
[10:29:38] <zpzpzpzpz> check topic
[10:29:59] <albedoa> okay, seems like sizzle should optimize for that :)
[10:30:40] <taplar> *shrug* i'm sure there is some trade off for that kind of predictive logic vs just having people write better code
[10:30:41] <Aikar> probally would require a coordination with jq
[10:31:13] <Aikar> taplar, well it's not intuitive that there would be a gain to that, if it wasn't for the IDE telling me, i'm sure most people wouldn't know that :P
[10:31:28] <Aikar> when you think on it deep yeah i see why the gain
[10:32:05] <R13ose> any thoughts on my question?
[10:32:12] <Aikar> though, jquery could breaks it up and make different calls to sizzle
[10:32:30] <dANOKELOFF> R13ose: let me rephrase, I have a div that contains text, each word has somes attributes ( start="timecode_start" and end="timecode_end" e.g: <span start="1.25" end="1.50">hello</word> ) This text is connected to a video and if the video is at 1.25seconds, so I add a border-bottom at my word. But now what i want is if the word is not visible (eg must scroll to see it), I scroll my div automatically for se
[10:32:30] <dANOKELOFF> e the word but I dont know how i can create an automatically scroll.
[10:32:32] <Aikar> but would add complexity
[10:39:59] <R13ose> dANOKELOFF: sorta like close captioning on a Video?
[10:40:54] <dANOKELOFF> yeah totally
[10:45:03] <dANOKELOFF> R13ose: I want to create something like that : http://www.speakertext.com/captionbox.html ( demo on the right side )
[10:48:29] <R13ose> dANOKELOFF: look at this: http://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/tests/test7b.html
[10:49:39] <dANOKELOFF> R13ose: Yeah !
[10:49:59] <R13ose> dANOKELOFF: here is the info: https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/
[10:51:26] <dANOKELOFF> thanks
[10:56:35] <R13ose> seems no one can help me with my question
[11:01:04] * AdamPDotty scrolls
[11:01:04] <Sangeet> any body work with lightbox?
[11:01:12] <R13ose> AdamPDotty: if you don't see this, I can rewrite this.
[11:01:22] <Sangeet> suddenly it start open image in the browser instead of open it into pop up
[11:03:40] <AdamPDotty> R13ose: Can not find it in the last 90 minutes.
[11:04:01] <AdamPDotty> Sangeet: changed target attribute?
[11:05:19] <Sangeet> @adamPDotty wait a min,let me try
[11:05:52] <Sangeet> there is nothing like target in the format,it is like this
[11:05:53] <Sangeet> <a href="images/tuv_certi.jpg" data-lightbox="tuv" data-title="My caption"><img class="example-image" src="images/tuv_certi.jpg" alt="" /></a>
[11:05:59] <R13ose> AdamPDotty: Use this code: http://pastebin.com/h65WSJyU to make sure the video in the modal popup stops after I close?  Here is my site: http://www.yx3tv.com/ should popup onload.
[11:08:57] <Sangeet> this is how it looks like <a href="images/tuv_certi.jpg" data-lightbox="tuv" data-title="My caption"><img class="example-image" src="images/tuv_certi.jpg" alt="" /></a>
[11:09:12] <AdamPDotty> and you wrote a custom event "emodalAfterClose" or is that a plugin?
[11:10:37] <R13ose> AdamPDotty: I didn't write the code, I took this from somewhere else and not sure how to adapt this for my site.
[11:11:42] <AdamPDotty> I can not find any class emodal.
[11:13:00] <R13ose> AdamPDotty: I know.  Read my comment above.
[11:14:38] <mad_moses> hi, is there a jquery or jqueryui function to sort one or multiple columns in a table?
[11:15:53] <AdamPDotty> Maybe http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/
[11:17:17] <mad_moses> thx
[11:17:29] <AdamPDotty> R13ose: looks like you have to load the plugin and name the container accordingly, but I do not know this plugin.
[11:17:51] <AdamPDotty> name = add a class
[11:18:33] <R13ose> AdamPDotty: can't I change the .emodal, emodalAfterClose and .video-js to whatever is on my site?
[11:18:46] <AdamPDotty> .emodal for the outer container and .video-js for the innermost
[11:19:15] <AdamPDotty> in that jquery function probably yes
[11:20:01] <AdamPDotty> outer would be #my_popup
[11:20:35] <AdamPDotty> but maybe there is an automatic init() from the plugin that looks specifically for .emodal .
[11:20:53] <R13ose> AdamPDotty: what is the inner one?
[11:22:32] <AdamPDotty> I am not sure. I would guess the <video> inside the iframe, which could be a new problem.
[11:23:53] <R13ose> AdamPDotty: Are you sure that is <video>?
[11:25:08] <Sangeet> ???
[11:33:33] <Sangeet> my code is not working when i write this <section id="exports" class="text-center clearfix "> what is wrong?
[11:33:45] <Sangeet> it is only working when i write <section>... #weird
[11:33:52] <Sangeet> lightbox pop up problem
[11:35:38] <islalobo> I'm trying to referer var x document.referrer; but it's coming up empty
[11:53:50] * taplar likes to merge it, merge it!
[12:47:18] <VectorX> how can i add click to this  jQuery('.tab-item-wrapper').hover(function(){
[12:47:23] <VectorX> like nested
[12:47:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:47:39] <VectorX>  jQuery('.tab-item-wrapper') click or hover on that
[12:47:51] <robertmaxrees> use .on() instead.
[12:47:56] <robertmaxrees> and mouseenter/mouseleave.
[12:48:32] <VectorX> does that work for mobile ?
[12:48:41] <robertmaxrees> which part.
[12:48:57] <VectorX> i got hover on desktop and i want the same function to work for when its touched/clicked on mobile
[12:49:15] <robertmaxrees> are you passing one function to .hover()
[12:49:20] <VectorX> yeah
[12:49:35] <VectorX> no mouseleave
[12:49:40] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/hover/ -> The .hover() method, when passed a single function, will execute that handler for both mouseenter and mouseleave events.
[12:50:11] <robertmaxrees> so you can use .on('click mouseenter mouseleave', function() {}); but there's a problem there.
[12:50:30] <VectorX> whats that
[12:51:03] <taplar> do you want to be firing the handler potentially 3 times?
[12:51:07] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:52:00] <VectorX> hell yeah
[12:52:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/65o6pg99/
[12:52:21] <robertmaxrees> i think you want the touch event instead.
[12:55:31] <VectorX> is that .on("tap" ?
[12:56:10] <robertmaxrees> the touch event?
[12:56:31] <robertmaxrees> .on('touch mouseenter mouseleave', function() {});
[12:57:21] <VectorX> ty
[13:09:22] <R13ose> Use this code: http://pastebin.com/LiTCUKy7 to make sure the video in the modal popup stops after I close?  Here is my site: http://www.yx3tv.com/ should popup onload.  I believe .emodal should be changed to #my_popup, is that right?
[13:10:00] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting emodalAfterClose from?
[13:10:14] <robertmaxrees> woah
[13:10:30] <SpecialTEch> Does anybody have experience with google tag manager and how to append parameters based on the data layer?
[13:11:42] <robertmaxrees> R13ose i can't get the modal to fire, but either way - check your console.  any errors?
[13:12:30] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: give me a sec.
[13:13:16] <robertmaxrees> i'll guess you'll get an error about .player being undefined or something similar.
[13:13:21] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: try again.
[13:13:56] <robertmaxrees> also: autoplaying music on your homepage like that is kind of a no-no.
[13:14:09] <robertmaxrees> still no modal.
[13:18:09] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I tried this on a different browser and this played.  If this modal pops up and doesn't play is that okay?
[13:18:19] <robertmaxrees> i meant the music on your homepage.
[13:18:30] <robertmaxrees> like, i open the page and music automatically starts going.
[13:19:33] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: Okay, I will fix that but what about the original question?
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:19:53] <robertmaxrees> if i can't replicate the modal, i'm not sure how to help.
[13:20:57] <robertmaxrees> jQuery(".video-js", this).player.pause(); - where atre you getting .player from?  are you using a particular plugin?
[13:21:43] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: yes but that code is from not my own.
[13:21:51] <robertmaxrees> >.> lol
[13:21:55] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[13:24:46] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: okay thanks, I will try get this to work again.
[13:29:50] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: you saw this once, this only places once a day and changing this doesn't help.
[13:29:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:30:59] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: the popup only places once a day.
[13:31:18] <robertmaxrees> it didn't show up for me the first time i hit the site.
[13:31:19] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[13:32:10] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: you did make this comment: "i open the page and music automatically starts going"
[13:32:19] <robertmaxrees> it did that every time i hit the page.
[13:32:34] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: does this still do that?
[13:32:40] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:32:53] <robertmaxrees> i haven't checked again.,
[13:33:24] <R13ose> can you?
[13:33:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:33:28] <robertmaxrees> link again?
[13:34:12] <R13ose> why is that funny?
[13:34:13] <R13ose> http://www.yx3tv.com/
[13:34:22] <robertmaxrees> just confused about what all you need from me.
[13:34:36] <robertmaxrees> didn't play that time.
[13:34:54] <taplar> only showed first time for me, though didn't pause when i closed it
[13:35:08] <robertmaxrees> i never actually saw the modal.  weird.
[13:35:28] <R13ose> taplar: right that is what I am trying to do with the code.
[13:45:15] <taplar> did you try putting a console log in the handler to make sure it's executing?
[13:46:19] <taplar> this is interesting though: jQuery(".video-js", this).player <-- wasn't aware jquery would expose something like that
[13:46:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't think it is.
[13:46:39] <robertmaxrees> which is why i asked if there are any errors.
[13:49:22] <R13ose> I haven't tested the code as I need to get FTP access.
[13:49:36] <robertmaxrees> you can use a step debugger then.
[13:51:01] <JSNewb> Hey guys, I need a basic function. Basically, I'm trying to find the percentage of a number between 2 numbers.
[13:51:18] <taplar> eh?
[13:51:22] <JSNewb> start: 1, end: 5, current: 3
[13:51:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:51:30] <JSNewb> It should give 0.5 as response
[13:51:39] <taplar> oh
[13:51:48] <JSNewb> I'm making a progress bar
[13:51:59] <decx> think about it for a second
[13:52:01] <taplar> so like value / (min + max)
[13:52:11] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: right
[13:52:13] <decx> it's preschool math
[13:52:34] <taplar> my favorite kind of math
[13:52:39] <JSNewb> My mind is about to explode, can't solve this tiny thing. Wasted 30 minutes already >.>
[13:53:06] <robertmaxrees> taplar literally just gave you the answer.
[13:53:11] <robertmaxrees> value / (min + max)

[15:22:33] <Fernando-Basso> What is the proper way to tell jquery ui sortable to take new dynamically added items into account so that I can drag and sort those as well?
[15:24:01] <Fernando-Basso> I am uploading images through ajax, and after they are uploaded the user should be able to change their position. It works fine except if they add new images _after_ sortable() has been invoked.
[15:24:41] <kevin> hey guys. so my ajaxStop handler doesn't trigger if one of the ajax handlers has a javascript error. any way to resolve this?
[15:25:08] <Fernando-Basso> I did $('#image-list').sortable('refresh'); just after inserting a new item, but it does nothing.
[15:26:08] <taplar> kevin: what do you mean a javascript error?  a syntax error?
[15:26:40] <kevin> taplar, no, perhaps a runtime error.
[15:26:47] <taplar> so an Error
[15:27:06] <kevin> like, attempting to access a member of a variable that is undefined, or something
[15:27:25] <kevin> taplar, yeah
[15:27:26] <taplar> why not make sure it exists first?
[15:27:53] <taplar> otherwise you could try sticking it in a try catch, but better to prevent the error in the first place
[15:29:10] <kevin> taplar, well yeah, we definitely want to minimize errors. but so my use-case is i have sorta a "loading spinner" that shows on ajaxStart and hides on ajaxStop... so, my spinner shows on the first ajax call, but if that call's response has some error for some reason, it never will call ajaxStop, so my spinner is always showing
[15:29:51] <kevin> if the call's ajax callback* has an error
[15:30:14] <taplar> are you attaching the callback, or is this like a plugin type thing?
[15:30:54] <kevin> it's our code that we attach to the deferred
[15:31:09] <kevin> i guess we could always just wrap our code in a try-catch
[15:31:17] <taplar> so, yeah, just prevent the error from happening, :S
[15:31:31] <Z3R0_> odd… my $.post() is returning a 200 code, but my .fail() is always running ?
[15:32:36] <Z3R0_> $.post(‘url’, function(r) { alert(‘success’); }).fail(function(r) { alert(‘fail’); }); // .fail is always running regardless of code returned :/
[15:33:17] <Z3R0_> ah weird… even though it was a 200 response, server was sending it back something strange…. all fied
[15:50:59] <ARandomFurry> Herro. I'm trying to test an onblur handler with Jasmine, but it seems that I can't get it working (infact; trigger("blur") and blur() don't execute the event handler at all). https://jsfiddle.net/nuf3dq89/ Here is an example of the event handler setup. Switching between both inputs doesn't alert the message as intended, and blurring one of them without focusing the other does alert as intended.
[15:50:59] <ARandomFurry> I'm not sure what I need to be doing to get the test working though.
[15:51:55] <taplar> setTimeout(blurTimeout, 0); ?
[15:52:26] <ARandomFurry> I need it to execute in the next turn otherwise regardless if the user clicked the other input, it won't be focused yet.
[17:16:28] <Z3R0_> small q...
[17:16:34] <robertmaxrees> BIG ANSWER
[17:17:35] <Z3R0_> I have a bootstrap modal A… and from within it, I open bootstrap modal B… both modals have a “submit” button… say class .submit…. but even if I reference… $(‘#ModalA’).on(‘click’, ‘.submit’) and $(‘#ModalB’).on(‘click’, ‘submit’) for some reason it submits the Top Level Form X Number of times… that modal is open
[17:17:50] <Z3R0_> (they are 2 different Modals…) but it still triggers the event per Modal open
[17:18:35] <robertmaxrees> why not bind to the submit event on each and make sure you top propagation of the event?
[17:19:15] <Z3R0_> what do you mean, I thought i was binding on each...
[17:19:33] <robertmaxrees> huh>?
[17:19:53] <robertmaxrees> $(‘#ModalA’).on(‘click’, ‘.submit’) is binding to click events on class="submit"
[17:20:07] <robertmaxrees> rather, that's a delegated listener for that.
[17:20:24] <Z3R0_> ah, and thus since ModalB was opened from A that event is already attache
[17:20:32] <robertmaxrees> uh?
[17:20:35] <robertmaxrees> *huh?  no.
[17:20:40] <Z3R0_> that’s why it’s duplicatin the hit....
[17:20:49] <robertmaxrees> you want $(‘#ModalA’).on(‘submit’, ‘form', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); })
[17:21:37] <Z3R0_> right now, I open a Add User Dialog… that dialog, attaches to employee… so I can “add new employee” from there, to update the employee list...
[17:21:49] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change my suggestion :)
[17:21:54] <Z3R0_> when I try to add new employee (when user modal) is open in the background, it attempts to add the new employee 2x
[17:22:19] <robertmaxrees> also: i'm going to guess that you're binding every time the modal opens or something like that.
[17:23:55] <Z3R0_> ah perfect the stopProp
[17:27:34] <Z3R0_> thanks
[18:07:50] <compact> hi. i have http://pastebin.com/EgD1Tr9p however if i have 2 sets of accordion, the second one doesn't work. any ida why
[18:08:06] <robertmaxrees> you can oinly have one #accordion per page.
[18:08:09] <robertmaxrees> use a class instead.
[18:09:17] <compact> perfect. thanks heaps
[19:20:54] <amigoo89> hey
[19:21:05] <robertmaxrees> hello
[19:21:47] <amigoo89> what is the best way to send data via ajax request to a php file, which includes a serialized string from a form PLUS an extra array?
[19:22:45] <robertmaxrees> create JSON and use ajax?
[19:23:45] <amigoo89> how do I need to create a simple JSON with jQuery and send it to a php file ?
[19:24:27] <robertmaxrees> you can use https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[19:24:36] <robertmaxrees> and then just .push() your extra array into that.
[19:25:03] <robertmaxrees> or you could custom create an object and then set the array as a property on it.
[19:28:16] <amigoo89> @robertmaxrees yes I tried that actually and it worked but, I struggled accessing it on php, I get like
[19:28:22] <amigoo89> (hold on a sec)
[19:28:38] <robertmaxrees> so i don't know php - you'd need to ask in a php channel about that side of things.
[19:31:00] <amigoo89> okay maybe you can still tell me how I could access to it, when I get this. I mean maybe it is equal in any language
[19:31:01] <amigoo89> https://jsfiddle.net/epv54wgL/
[19:31:08] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:31:10] <robertmaxrees> it's php.
[19:31:13] <robertmaxrees> php and js are totally different.
[19:31:22] <amigoo89> okay thanks tho
[19:49:33] <ascheel> I see there's a jquery mobile and a jquery for standard.  Do they work with the same themes?  I have instructions for a school project (college) to roll a mobile-oriented site and to have multiple themes on different pages.  Do I use the same themes from the non-mobile themeroller?
[19:49:51] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:49:57] <robertmaxrees> jquery is the base library.
[19:50:10] <robertmaxrees> jquery mobile builds on top of that to give you a mobile framework.
[19:51:14] <ascheel> So jquery mobile needs a theme from the jquery mobile themeroller and cannot use the standard themeroller themes?
[19:51:38] <robertmaxrees> when you say "standard themeroller" what are you referencing?
[19:52:01] <ascheel> Alhttp://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[19:52:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not jquery.
[19:52:08] <robertmaxrees> that's jquery ui.
[19:52:19] <robertmaxrees> that builds on top of jquery to give you a ui toolkit.
[19:52:28] <robertmaxrees> afaik they don't share "themeroller" setups.
[19:52:30] <ascheel> Ah...  so jquery is just the set of libraries for simple stuff.
[19:52:37] <robertmaxrees> jquery is one library.
[19:52:39] <robertmaxrees> a single file.
[19:52:41] <ascheel> Also, this is what I'm referring to for jquery mobile themeroller:  https://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/
[19:52:44] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui is another library.
[19:52:55] <ascheel> Is this the appropriate channel for JQuery UI?
[19:52:56] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui uses jquery along with a ton of added features.
[19:52:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:53:17] <ascheel> Ok, so at least I've situated that out.  ;)
[19:54:26] <ascheel> So, if I grab a theme, I get jquery-ui.css, jquery-ui.js, jquery-ui.structure.css, and jquery-ui.theme.css.   jquery-ui.js is just a bundled jquery-ui library, correct?
[19:54:37] <robertmaxrees> it's been a while.
[19:54:37] <ascheel> So what's the diff between jquery-ui.css, .structure.css, and .theme.css?
[19:55:06] <robertmaxrees> first is probably the base css, sturcture is going to be all the size/structure declaratiuons, and theme is going to be the customizations.
[19:55:11] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess.
[19:57:36] <ascheel> Ok, looks like jquery-ui.css contains the base css and theme.css both (among others)
[19:57:58] <robertmaxrees> theme.css will have overrides in it.
[19:57:59] <robertmaxrees> iirc.
[19:58:57] <ascheel> Yeah, that's not confusing.  .structure.css contains many of the same elements as jquery-ui.css.  Time for trial-and-error.
[19:59:04] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:59:11] <robertmaxrees> it's actually not confusing.
[19:59:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused about why you're looking at jquery ui in the first place.
[19:59:57] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were building a mobile site,
[20:00:10] <ascheel> Right.  And my task is to have multiple pages and multiple themes.
[20:00:16] <ascheel> Theming it is part of jquery-ui, no?
[20:00:24] <robertmaxrees> jquery mobile, in your case.
[20:00:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui is for desktop.
[20:00:43] <robertmaxrees> the projects are moving in exactly the way you're describing, but we're not there yet.
[20:00:54] <robertmaxrees> so you want to look at just jquery mobile for now.
[20:01:19] <ascheel> OK, then do the themes from jquery-ui work in jquery mobile?  I apologize if I've asked this.
[20:01:24] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:01:29] <ascheel> OK.
[21:05:38] <ascheel> I have a basic issue that I'm sure is something simple.  http://scheels.dyndns.org/weber/A13/mobi/index.html  It's using jquery mobile, but everything looks tiny, like it's working on a desktop.  When I view the page on the desktop, the buttons appear overly huge, like it's expecting a mobile page.
[21:08:02] <ascheel> Nevermind.  My Google-Fu improved.  I needed to set a meta viewport tag
