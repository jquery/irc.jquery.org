[00:03:27] <someprimetime> how can i stop a blur event?
[00:03:32] <someprimetime> or prevent it in the future
[00:05:42] <ntry> i have a little gadget for any website that is running in its own jquery namespace like this (function($) { /* functions */ })(customJQUERY). How can i stop everything that happens inside of this?
[00:07:07] <systemfault> Remove the lines from the .js file?
[00:07:09] <systemfault> :/
[00:07:46] <ntry> no i mean, while the runtime.
[00:08:16] <evenix> hi all
[00:08:57] <Steve___> <evenix> hi
[00:09:42] <LukeNukem> Is it possible to have a jquery function in onclick=
[00:10:30] <systemfault> Can't you use real event listeners?
[00:11:16] <coldhead> LukeNukem: you know better than to use onclick!
[00:11:31] <coldhead> its no the jquery way
[00:11:42] <systemfault> s/jquery/good/
[00:11:49] <coldhead> its not the jake weary ray
[00:12:32] <LukeNukem> coldhead, yeah but im trying to do an iframe form submit
[00:12:41] <LukeNukem> the tutorial im following is using raw js and onClick
[00:12:53] <coldhead> you should know better than to use an iframe!
[00:13:03] <LukeNukem> ;o
[00:13:05] <LukeNukem> what else do i use?
[00:13:13] <LukeNukem> ajax does not support file uploads
[00:13:14] <coldhead> its for cross domain forms isn't it
[00:13:18] <coldhead> oh right
[00:13:30] <coldhead> UGH
[00:13:34] <systemfault> LukeNukem: There's a nice plugin for that.
[00:13:41] <LukeNukem> systemfault, uploadify meh
[00:13:45] <coldhead> just avoid file uploads all together
[00:13:46] <LukeNukem> coldhead, DONT TELL ME TO USE FLASH OR I BANG YOUR HEAD
[00:13:52] <coldhead> tell your client it can't be done
[00:13:57] <systemfault> LukeNukem: :'( Y U NO LISTEN TO ME?
[00:14:06] <systemfault> LukeNukem: I wasn't going to mention uploadify...
[00:14:07] <coldhead> you're wandering in a horrible ie wasteland
[00:14:12] <LukeNukem> systemfault, which plugin you are talking about? ajaxform plugin?
[00:14:16] <systemfault> LukeNukem: But… jquery iframe transport
[00:14:23] <LukeNukem> googling
[00:14:32] <systemfault> LukeNukem: It does what you want to do in a cleaner way
[00:14:34] <evenix> im having an issue with show/hide and   j render : https://gist.github.com/2516758
[00:14:58] <systemfault> LukeNukem: http://cmlenz.github.com/jquery-iframe-transport/
[00:15:00] <evenix> on my RoR app i have an endless pagination effect.. when it renders the content the 'comment' button that is supposed to be triggered by a javascript call is not working
[00:15:11] <systemfault> LukeNukem: I'm using it at work, works nicely
[00:16:05] <LukeNukem> man really ajax should support file uploads
[00:16:11] <LukeNukem> ajax Y U NO SUPPORT FILES
[00:16:11] <evenix> so pretty much: https://gist.github.com/2516758 'Comments' are not showing hidden div when being rendered by will_paginate endless pagination, but work fine when the initial conente is generated on page load
[00:16:58] <LukeNukem> coldhead, Did you watch Avengers yet?
[00:17:05] <systemfault> LukeNukem: XHR2 with the File APIs can do it… only on the newest browsers though
[00:17:36] <LukeNukem> hm
[00:19:11] <coldhead> LukeNukem: i could go see it at any moment
[00:19:12] <coldhead> should i?
[00:19:16] <coldhead> i probably should
[00:19:41] <LukeNukem> im going to
[00:19:42] <ntry> is there a way to stop everything thats happening inside of a jquery namespace immediately?
[00:19:44] <LukeNukem> 2:()() pm :D
[00:19:54] <LukeNukem> systemfault, does it work with multiple forms
[00:19:57] <LukeNukem> on the same page
[00:20:08] <someprimetime> any way that i can get this to not trigger the second animate ({ height: '50' }... when text has been entered?
[00:20:32] <someprimetime> normally it should just kind of toggle between 100 and 50px, but if they enter text, i'd like to keep it at 100
[00:20:34] <systemfault> LukeNukem: The upload plugin? Yeah
[00:20:37] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/K4bZp/1/
[00:20:55] <LukeNukem> systemfault, because my forms are like name='editform_4'
[00:20:56] <LukeNukem> and then
[00:20:58] <LukeNukem> editform_5
[00:21:00] <LukeNukem> like that
[00:21:15] <ussher_> is there an easy way to format the amount of days left until a specific timestamp into  "dd:hh:mm:ss" format.  where the days can be up to 99 days away?  (its for a countdown clock)
[00:21:58] <systemfault> LukeNukem: It will work just fine
[00:22:18] <LukeNukem> good or i kick itz ass
[00:22:20] <LukeNukem> :"D
[00:23:01] <LukeNukem> systemfault, where do you work
[00:25:00] <LukeNukem> systemfault, $("#myform").submit(function() The id could be anything
[00:25:03] <LukeNukem> not static
[00:26:09] <systemfault> LukeNukem: You can pick the fields you want to send dynamically.
[00:26:23] <systemfault> Anyway :P Don't use it if you don't like it !
[00:27:46] <ntry> is there a way to stop everything that happens inside of a jquery namespace immediately?
[00:28:40] <LukeNukem> systemfault, i having difficulties using with multiple forms so i will try without iframe plugin
[00:28:41] <LukeNukem> thanks
[00:28:43] <LukeNukem> i gota go
[00:28:44] <LukeNukem> movie time
[00:29:52] <someprimetime> ntry: return false?
[00:33:01] <ntry> where? i am working on a bookmarklet that is running in its own jquery namespace like this (function($) { /* functions */ })(customJQUERY). No i want to build a close function, that stops all running code and removes all added elements. Removing works fine but the functions called inside of an intervall are obviously running once again, even if i call clearInterval.
[00:33:18] <ntry> No = now
[00:34:01] <Dr-Bombay> http://memegenerator.net/instance/19586956
[00:35:04] <someprimetime> ntry: do you freaking read?
[00:35:08] <someprimetime> RETURN FALSE;
[00:35:28] <someprimetime> which is a combination of e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault()
[00:36:02] <ntry> hm, but where?
[00:36:12] <someprimetime> in your close function that you haven't made yet
[00:36:13] <ntry> i dont get it.
[00:36:39] <someprimetime> post a fiddle
[00:40:22] <ntry> sadly its too complex to make a fiddle out of it :(
[00:40:43] <someprimetime> post a gist
[00:40:47] <someprimetime> or don't
[00:40:52] <someprimetime> i told you what you need
[00:41:33] <ntry> there is a return false inside of my close function.
[00:42:51] <someprimetime> did you put the close function within another function?
[00:43:03] <someprimetime> if so, move it outside of it
[00:43:10] <someprimetime> since it's returning from the current function not the parent
[00:43:13] <someprimetime> which is what i think you want
[00:49:03] <ntry> someprimetime: http://pastebin.com/FpRxrD3D
[00:49:55] <someprimetime> where are you calling killBookmarklet
[00:50:07] <ntry> its like this. When i call killBookmarklet() the  setupSelection() seems to be one more time
[00:50:13] <ntry> its on a mouseclick
[00:52:33] <someprimetime> so essentially you are returning false from inside of the event handler function (mouseclick)
[00:52:49] <someprimetime> so after killBookmarklet() the function returns false from that function, not the parent function
[00:53:07] <someprimetime> if i'm understanding this properly ( i don't see the event function in your gist)
[00:53:17] <ntry> yes
[00:53:20] <someprimetime> but in that case, throw a return false after the event handler for (mouseclick)
[00:53:24] <someprimetime> that should work
[00:54:51] <ntry> $('<div class="powll--closebutton" />').click(function(){ killBookmarklet(); });
[00:55:45] <someprimetime> do $('.powll-closebutton').click(function() { killbookMarklet(); return false; });
[00:55:52] <ntry> ok
[01:17:11] <lijz> hi i have a set of li's which are generated dynamically, i want to put a pager ol li under the above said li's . how to position the ol under the dynamically generated li's?
[01:18:57] <lijz> i tried using relative to the ol
[01:19:24] <lijz> pooooooooi
[01:19:36] <lijz> today is holiday here?
[01:20:19] <lijz> jujubi
[01:41:09] <evenix> how do I  append or add an entire javascript to a selector  whenever it renders
[01:41:12] <evenix> a content
[01:42:16] <evenix> https://gist.github.com/2517236
[01:54:30] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[02:03:25] <evenix> what  event handler do i need to make a script run everytime new content are being generated?
[02:03:43] <evenix> my content here is generated through a partial so 'microposts'
[02:04:03] <evenix> this.live('click', function() { }); ?
[02:04:45] <sehh> hey people
[02:05:10] <Antaranian> evenix: sorry, you need to run it when content changed ?
[02:05:15] <sehh> q: is there a way to avoid showing a broken layout, which jquery UI is loading and creating the GUI elements?
[02:05:24] <sehh> s/which/while
[02:05:39] <evenix> Antaranian:  https://gist.github.com/2517236
[02:06:15] <evenix> I want to make sure that my script with $(".show_hide" + value).show().click(function () {   is working at all time even with the content newly generated to the page
[02:06:21] <evenix> so far it only works when the page is being loaded
[02:06:35] <evenix> all the conent appearing after are not working with the scritpt
[02:08:10] <evenix> i spent the entire night on the issue i juts need that fixed to launch my website
[02:08:26] <evenix> im going through the jquery documentation and tried a few things
[02:08:39] <evenix> but i havent found the right event or method i guess
[02:09:00] <Antaranian> evenix: one way is to place all that .show() part in content rendering callback scope
[02:09:16] <Antaranian> and catch click and other events via .delegate()
[02:09:58] <evenix> Antaranian:  ill be honest its still confusing to me im going to go and read about delegate to see if it works and try to better understand what you suggested
[02:11:23] <evenix> Antaranian: yes thats definitely what i need
[02:11:32] <evenix> ill  try and see how i can implement it thanks.
[02:11:38] <Antaranian> :)
[02:16:38] <evenix> Antaranian: https://gist.github.com/2517236  check the comment
[02:17:26] <evenix> hmm not working
[02:17:56] <Antaranian> you're trying to implement some real-time posting app here ?
[02:18:27] <Antaranian> so newly rendered (micro)posts' elements will handle click events ?
[02:18:47] <denysonique>    $('.container').empty()
[02:18:47] <denysonique>    $('.container').append($element)
[02:18:51] <denysonique> what is the alterantive to this?
[02:19:13] <evenix> Antaranian: yes
[02:19:14] <Antaranian> $('.container').html($element)
[02:19:24] <denysonique> when I use .html() .container looses the reference to $element
[02:19:26] <denysonique> Antaranian: ↑
[02:19:42] <denysonique> new html is being rendered
[02:20:44] <Antaranian> denysonique: then I can't say definitely, why you need it ?
[02:21:07] <Antaranian> evenix: add a general class to microposts, like .micropost
[02:21:32] <Antaranian> then add event handler to container, lets say #microposts
[02:21:47] <denysonique> Antaranian: My Backbone.js relies on $element. It is the only way to avoid re-rendering .container
[02:22:11] <denysonique> Antaranian: than you anyway!
[02:22:15] <denysonique> thank*
[02:22:35] <Antaranian> and go with delegation like $('#microposts').delegate('.micropost', 'click', fn);
[02:23:01] <Antaranian> denysonique: can I see the code ?
[02:23:06] <denysonique> s/My Backbone.js/My Backbone.js code/
[02:23:13] <rootcoma> Is there a difference between $(window).ready() and $(window).load() ?
[02:24:45] <Antaranian> denysonique: yes, can you post it to pastie ?
[02:25:02] <Antaranian> rootcoma: .ready() fires when DOM is ready
[02:25:22] <Antaranian> some images could not be loaded yet
[02:25:33] <Antaranian> or flash
[02:25:47] <rootcoma> Thanks, I need to have all images loaded. So I will use load. Right on.
[02:25:51] <evenix> Antaranian: thanks im trying it right now
[02:26:40] <rootcoma> That explains why I got seemingly random results with ready as well..
[02:26:43] <denysonique> Antaranian:  sure, here you are https://gist.github.com/022af86e2ffafbde64c6
[02:27:25] <denysonique> Antaranian: line 15 updates the el, which should be updated in .container
[02:27:29] <denysonique> only works with append
[02:30:03] <Antaranian> aw, coffee.. glamorous.. :)
[02:30:18] <Antaranian> @el stands for this.el ?
[02:30:23] <denysonique> Antaranian: yes
[02:31:09] <denysonique> Antaranian: http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#View-el
[02:33:27] <Antaranian> this.el is jQuery object or a dom element ?
[02:33:36] <coldhead> Uploading (72%)...
[02:34:42] <denysonique> Antaranian: dom
[02:34:47] <denysonique> Antaranian: $el -- jquery object
[02:36:44] <Antaranian> did you tried to assign this.$el to $(this.el), then this.$el.html(tem...) ?
[02:37:37] <Antaranian> $el.html('test') won't loose reference to $el
[02:38:03] <Antaranian> not sure how it implemented in Backbone views
[02:38:16] <evenix> Antaranian:  https://gist.github.com/2517236#comments  it didnt work
[02:38:32] <evenix> i had some question along the way that I added on the comments*
[02:39:29] <Dr-Bombay> hello i am a software recruiter for fortune 500 companies and i would like to know if anyone here knows how to agile in agile
[02:39:55] <Dr-Bombay> i have a job opening developing agile for the agile
[02:41:28] <Antaranian> evenix: sorry, what the 'value' stands for ?
[02:41:57] <evenix> $.each(micropostIds, function (index, value) {
[02:42:15] <evenix> Antaranian: i scan the page and look for the micropost on the page
[02:42:26] <evenix> map it and return index , value
[02:42:42] <evenix> which allowsm me to have a fbcomment with an url for each single post
[02:43:42] <Antaranian> 1s
[02:43:48] <evenix> Antaranian:  i updated the gist
[02:43:59] <evenix> file_1 shows how I am getting those micropost.ids
[02:44:10] <evenix> to assign value
[03:41:36] <Narhir> hey guys, any ideas why this NIVO slider doesnt work ? on www.creativeroof.co.uk Im using Drupal 7
[03:46:46] <astropirate> Nahir, you dont have jquery setup
[03:47:16] <astropirate> look at your debug console
[03:48:00] <Narhir> got it
[03:48:10] <Narhir> I was using jquery 1.44 but I should be using 1.71
[03:48:32] <astropirate> i dont think thats the issue
[03:48:39] <astropirate> it doesn't recognize the $ variable
[03:48:53] <astropirate> which is what jquery automatically sets as its variable
[03:51:47] <Narhir> seems to work now
[03:56:00] <jes> What would be a good pregmatch to check if a date is in the format: yyyy-mm-dd?
[03:56:42] <astropirate> lol
[04:18:31] <gyaresu> Ok. I'm feeling ridiculous here. Why won't my stylesheets load?
[04:18:34] <gyaresu> http://oslogigs-node.herokuapp.com/
[04:19:28] <gyaresu> I'm doing a re-write in node of my existing app. I cannot figure out why a browser won't download the css files.
[04:28:23] <dns-away> Hello
[04:28:59] <astropirate> gyaresu: should ask in #node.js  but do you have a static file server set up?
[04:29:26] <gyaresu> the files are accessible statically. yeah.
[04:29:38] <astropirate> :S
[04:29:42] <gyaresu> astropirate: I might need more sleep but I just don't get it.
[04:30:01] <jes> Is there any way to make validate plugin work when I'm using type="button" instead of submit?
[04:30:14] <dns-away> Anyone can help me, with simple count ? :-)
[04:30:43] <astropirate> gyaresu: i dont get it.. its loading the css files
[04:31:13] <astropirate> Jes, you can just listen on the submit event for the form
[04:33:22] <dns-away> I want count div's, but counter (leight,size), not work correctly.
[04:33:26] <dns-away> My jsbin is http://jsbin.com/ugemik/10
[04:34:13] <gyaresu> astropirate: I was using 'src' not 'href' in the template. Thanks for helping :)
[04:34:32] <astropirate> gyaresu: HAAH glad you found it
[04:34:53] <Woet> dns-away: you can only have 1 unique ID, use classes if you want multiple
[04:35:26] <dns-away> Thanks :-)
[04:57:37] <jes> How do I force a form not to submit?
[04:58:12] <astropirate> threaten the user with heavy fines
[04:59:51] <jes> Well I have a button that does ajax stuff when clicked (submits the form), but the validation plugin doesn't really like the type="button". So I wanna make the button a "submit" but never actually submit it.
[05:00:07] <jes> :)
[05:24:36] <stitox__> i have a problem, i wanna make a fixed position bottom block buck the position absolute doesn't work when i scroll i tried the fixed position but doesn't work too is there any way to make that wrok?
[05:32:35] <james13433> its .css() to change a couple css elements at one right? e.g width, position and border?
[05:34:48] <ravenzz> james13433 yep
[05:34:58] <ravenzz> you can change more than one
[05:35:03] <ravenzz> property anyay
[05:36:35] <james13433> thanks
[05:37:44] <ravenzz> .css({ width: '100px', height: '200px' })
[05:47:23] <james13433> I don't seem to be able to get the correct width of an input ?:/
[05:49:06] <james13433> ahh the border isn't 1px by defualt
[05:52:46] <jes> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/date This page has a bug in it when I press validate with some data entered it puts the entire page in a div.
[05:54:04] <vpv4oo> there seems to be something odd about $.getScript(); i abandoned my plan to integrate the OVI maps api, now i just downloaded the jquery.gmap.js addon and its the exact same problem!
[05:55:19] <vpv4oo> when the scipt is sitting on the same server, it is fetching it. i see GET jquery.gmap.js 200 OK . but a console.log("gmaps addon loaded"); inside of the succeded-part of the getScript() does not appear in the log !
[05:56:06] <vpv4oo> but i dont get any errors either
[06:24:44] <james13433> will .chidren() just take one level of children not all decentants?
[06:27:04] <nFFF> exactly
[06:27:15] <nFFF> find would take all descendants
[06:27:19] <nFFF> ?children()
[06:27:20] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[06:27:21] <nFFF> ?find
[06:27:22] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[06:28:59] <heartofashark> Anyone have advice on a good hosting service to choose for a freelancer? I want to host multiple websites off of the same server.
[06:29:52] <nFFF> hetzner.de
[07:10:55] <vpv4oo> no matter what i try, i always get stuck with &.getScript not working
[07:12:18] <vpv4oo> different apis different methods, but as soon as getScript() is involved i get errors like "A call of document.write() by an asynchronously loaded script has been ignored."
[07:12:43] <vpv4oo> or it just doesnt get into the success part of getScript, even though the source is there
[07:12:59] <vpv4oo> and i even see it loading the script, 200 OK
[07:14:33] <vpv4oo> i bet many users have done this, for example if you have ajaxed content with a menu, only reloading the page content, not the menu
[07:14:56] <vpv4oo> and the content that youre loading contains a google map
[07:16:43] <vpv4oo> the most obvious and easy workaround is to load the maps api in the <head> of your document, but i think thats a waste of bandwidth
[07:18:23] <vpv4oo> isnt that what getScript() is supposed to do? let you dynamically load for example the google maps api when ajax-loading page content supposed to contain the map? or am i misunderstanding the idea
[07:42:38] <Wilornel> Guys, I have an error saying the object has no method "src". Could you please check the gist? https://gist.github.com/2519550
[07:48:11] <gehsekky> Wilornel: that should really be $(this).attr('src', 'images/starDown.png');
[07:48:57] <Wilornel> Oh cool
[07:48:59] <Wilornel> But why so?
[07:49:13] <gehsekky> because $(this) is a jquery object
[07:49:23] <gehsekky> if you were just using the native js node, you could do node.src = ''
[07:49:50] <Wilornel> Oh alright, thanks
[07:50:41] <gehsekky> if that still doesn't work, i think you might have to 'that' your 'this'
[07:54:28] <dangerousdave> what should i set img src too before its been set in js, I want to avoid browser warnings
[07:54:34] <dangerousdave> to*
[07:55:27] <jcp_> are there performance implications for bundling all variables up like this: http://jsfiddle.net/K2Bhn/
[07:59:05] <davemo> jcp_: you are re-querying the DOM every time you call app.elements
[07:59:11] <davemo> there's no caching
[07:59:36] <cybersholt> hello anybody here use blue imp ajax upload im trying to figure out a way to sort my uploads
[07:59:47] <jcp_> davemo:  is there a better way to do that without duplicating variable assignments?
[07:59:51] <jcp_> or a proper way*
[08:00:17] <davemo> you could just cache the results in variables
[08:00:31] <davemo> var body = $("body")
[08:00:44] <davemo> app.elements = function() { return { body: body … }
[08:01:00] <davemo> just assign the queried nodes to variables, and have your app.elements be a simple getter
[08:01:58] <jcp_> okay, i'll give it a shot. do you think this approach is awkward and it would be better if i just  assigned variables within app.trigger, app.aside, etc
[08:02:29] <davemo> jcp_: it depends what you're trying to do, in general I think caching the results of jQuery selections is a good thing to do
[08:02:47] <jcp_> davemo: ya, but i mean caching them all in app.elements instead of throughout the app
[08:03:16] <davemo> i think cache once in your app.elements is fine
[08:03:18] <davemo> caching is the key :)
[08:03:21] <jcp_> okay thanks!
[08:08:44] <cybersholt> hello anybody here use blue imp ajax upload im trying to figure out a way to sort my uploads ???
[08:10:14] <PhonicUK> is there a way of programatically getting the properties of a jquery-ui object?
[08:10:33] <devnill> in what way?
[08:11:02] <PhonicUK> i want to know what properties a specified object can have at runtime
[08:11:03] <PhonicUK> so i can list them
[08:11:29] <devnill> do you have any code?
[08:11:36] <PhonicUK> nope, not yet :P
[08:11:43] <PhonicUK> ive just created a dialog() object
[08:11:51] <PhonicUK> and now I want to find out what properties it has available to set
[08:12:39] <devnill> you should be able to use a standard jquery selector to grab it
[08:12:52] <PhonicUK> i don't think you understand what I'm trying to do
[08:13:14] <PhonicUK> take a look at something like http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ - and look at the list of 'options' that you can specify
[08:13:23] <PhonicUK> i want to know at runtime what that list of options is
[08:13:49] <devnill> ohhhh
[08:14:21] <devnill> not sure
[08:14:44] <devnill> I'll counter with my own question
[08:15:25] <devnill> my $.on() is bubbling up the DOM even though im telling it to stop propagation
[08:15:26] <devnill> http://pastebin.com/1fDMJQZ1
[08:20:48] <astropirate> devnill, there is your problem
[08:20:52] <astropirate> you are using .on()
[08:21:04] <astropirate> on uses event propegation
[08:21:20] <astropirate> i think it listens on the document element
[08:21:20] * gnarf slaps astropirate
[08:21:26] <astropirate> :(
[08:21:31] <gnarf> .on() is the preferred method for all binding in 1.7+
[08:21:36] <Wilornel> Why cant I .die() an event?? https://gist.github.com/2519550
[08:21:36] <gnarf> everything else maps to it
[08:21:59] <Wilornel> would .on be better than .live??
[08:22:02] <gnarf> Wilornel: because you have to kill the event for everything
[08:22:03] <astropirate> gnarf, wait... then how do you... i'm so confused. so .bind() and .propegate()  used to do different things
[08:22:13] <gnarf> Wilornel: most definitely
[08:22:24] <Wilornel> gnerf: but what do you mean? Kill the event for everything??
[08:22:28] <gnarf> astropirate: .on( events, selector, data, handler )
[08:22:33] <gnarf> selector and data are both optional
[08:22:44] <astropirate> AHHH
[08:22:55] <gnarf> Wilornel: so .die() undoes a .live() - but lets pretend like live and die don't exist cuz they are bad to use anyway
[08:23:14] <astropirate> i have lots of old code to fix :(
[08:23:26] <gnarf> so like... $( selector ).live( "click", fn )
[08:23:27] <Wilornel> gnarf: .on does not work for dynamically added content
[08:23:42] <gnarf> is equivalent to $( document ).on( "click", selector, fn )
[08:23:50] <Wilornel> oh..........
[08:24:07] <gnarf> we suggest finding something less "global" than "document" to bind on though
[08:24:17] <gnarf> something that won't change - that will contain your dynamic content
[08:24:24] <Wilornel> like a div?
[08:24:28] <gnarf> yup
[08:24:47] <Wilornel> 1.7 exists since when?
[08:24:51] <gnarf> $( "#container" ).on( "mouseenter", ".starImg" )
[08:25:03] <gnarf> like what was the release date?
[08:25:17] <Wilornel> yeah
[08:25:26] <gnarf> 11/03/2011 is the blog post
[08:25:30] <Wilornel> Oh ok
[08:25:30] <gnarf> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released/
[08:25:51] <Wilornel> Its just that I use jquery for 2 weeks and I never heard of on and of
[08:25:54] <Wilornel> off*
[08:26:00] <Wilornel> ok let me try that thing you showed me
[08:28:09] <devnill> so how can i stop on from bubbling? I'm assuming it just shows the original selector
[08:28:36] <Wilornel> gnarf: doesnt work ._. https://gist.github.com/2519550
[08:28:39] <gnarf> devnill: what?  event.stopPropagation() ?
[08:28:45] <devnill> thats what i did
[08:29:00] <gnarf> ?doesnt work @Wilornel
[08:29:01] <bot-t> Wilornel, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[08:29:16] <devnill> its still showing the original selector instead of what i'm clicking on within it
[08:29:35] <gnarf> ?demo @devnill
[08:29:36] <bot-t> devnill, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:29:39] <gnarf> devnill: event.target
[08:29:40] <devnill> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10364887/on-bubbling-after-stoppropagation
[08:29:43] <Wilornel> No errors, Its just like if the element has not been hovered
[08:30:35] <gnarf> Wilornel: is ".star" already in the DOM when that code runs?
[08:30:40] <gnarf> or is that being dynamically added too?
[08:30:49] <gnarf> the event needs to get bound on something concrete
[08:31:01] <Wilornel> alright let me try again
[08:31:06] <jcp_> this just feels really redundant to have to assign the variable and then return it again… is there a way to shorten it? http://jsfiddle.net/rDXJG/
[08:31:22] <devnill> event.target worked gnarf
[08:31:24] <devnill> thanks!
[08:31:57] <jcp_> oops sorry http://jsfiddle.net/rDXJG/1/
[08:32:00] <gnarf> jcp_: var exports = { ......... }; return exports ?
[08:32:57] <Wilornel> gnarf: Oh great it works! :D
[08:33:01] <vpv4oo> i have a problem: this works: http://jsfiddle.net/GuNX3/ but when i cut off that head, only take the body content that i load under a different <head> with jQuery's load() into a <div> then it doesnt work anymore. why?
[08:33:04] <Wilornel> Now the off does not work...
[08:33:49] <gnarf> Wilornel: now, you need to understand how these events work to understand what you want
[08:33:54] <gnarf> I dont think you want .off()
[08:34:02] <Wilornel> I need to unbind the .on
[08:34:10] <gnarf> you'd have to $('.star').off("mouseenter")
[08:34:15] <gnarf> which would unbind ALL of them
[08:34:25] <gnarf> you can't "unbind" it from "this" because it isn't bound on this...
[08:34:36] <gnarf> Wilornel: its bound on that concrete container
[08:34:39] <gnarf> however
[08:34:48] <gnarf> thats what "event.stopPropagation()" becomes handy for
[08:35:15] <gnarf> you could $( this ).closest( ".star" ).on( "mouseenter mouseleave", function( event ) { event.stopPropagation(); } );
[08:35:50] <gnarf> that goes up the tree to the "star" (which i assume contains all the images?) then binds a new function on it that will stop event propagation
[08:35:51] <Wilornel> you assume that .star has not ben added dynamically?
[08:35:55] <jcp_> gnarf: awesome, thanks!
[08:35:59] <gnarf> no, i assume it has been
[08:36:05] <gnarf> but by the time you click on something
[08:36:16] <gnarf> its parent "star" is where you want to stop propagating those event
[08:36:44] <Wilornel> ok but you assume that "this" has not ben added dynamically
[08:36:46] <Wilornel> right?
[08:36:49] <gnarf> no
[08:36:51] <Wilornel> what?
[08:37:02] <gnarf> I assume it is currently "in the document" when you click on it
[08:37:14] <Wilornel> yeah but you use .on..
[08:37:15] <gnarf> in fact it pretty much has to be
[08:37:30] <gnarf> .on() can only work on things that exist
[08:37:45] <gnarf> which it does, by the time it runs
[08:37:52] <Wilornel> yeah but the #container must be stable"
[08:37:55] <Wilornel> yeah but the #container must be "stable"
[08:38:12] <gnarf> Wilornel: when binding an event you want to match later against a selector, yes
[08:38:24] <gnarf> Wilornel: think bout it for a second
[08:38:43] <gnarf> $("#container").on() <--- binds an event on anything matching #container
[08:39:07] <gnarf> $(".star").on() <--- if there aren't any ".star" yet - this obviously can't bind to them
[08:39:25] <gnarf> or if you add a new .star later, it doesn't magically get that event bound either
[08:39:51] <Wilornel> So you can attach an .on() event AFTER the element has been created
[08:40:01] <gnarf> right
[08:40:17] <gnarf> the "selector" you optionally pass to on
[08:40:22] <gnarf> turns it into a "delegated" handler
[08:40:32] <Wilornel> But then when, earlier, why I binded attached the .on() to .star, which was added dinamically, it did not work?
[08:40:36] <gnarf> the way these work, since each event "propagates" up to the parent
[08:40:46] <gnarf> Wilornel: because .star wasn't yet on the page
[08:40:51] <Wilornel> It was
[08:40:55] <gnarf> Wilornel: it couldn't find it to attach to it
[08:41:05] <Wilornel> oh
[08:41:06] <Wilornel> wait
[08:41:08] <Wilornel> ohh
[08:41:13] <Wilornel> OH OKAY! :D
[08:41:23] <Wilornel> okay I get it now :P
[08:41:41] <gnarf> so the selector... it says, "bind up here, but only match when one of the things inside me gets clicked matches this selector"
[08:42:28] <Wilornel> Alright thanks alot ^^
[08:42:54] <gnarf> so $("#container").on("click", ".star", fn) <-- this binds a single event on #container, that when a click event occurs, it checks the event's original target to see if it matches that selector
[08:43:35] <gnarf> Wilornel: so - do you mind putting your new updates back on that gist?
[08:43:45] <Wilornel> I just thought that It attaches the .on event as soon as the user clicks on it
[08:43:45] <jes> What function should i use for regexp?
[08:43:53] <Wilornel> gnarf: yea one sec
[08:44:13] <gnarf> Wilornel: also, just want to point out that $(this).attr("src", url) is kinda pointless -- this.src = url works just as well and doesn't require like 8 function calls to get there
[08:44:13] <gnarf> :)
[08:44:41] <Wilornel> But someone told me to do it this way
[08:44:51] <Wilornel> It didnt work when I did thi.src
[08:45:46] <gnarf> Wilornel: that someone was wrong... there are a lot of times people get so excited about having attr() they forget they have the DOM
[08:46:15] <Wilornel> $(this).src?
[08:46:21] <gnarf> this.src
[08:46:29] <gnarf> this === DOMElement
[08:46:42] <Wilornel> Oh great it works! :D
[08:46:46] <gnarf> jQuery( this ) === jQuery ;)
[08:46:52] <Wilornel> Oh I seee
[08:47:12] <Wilornel> this.src is javascript, not jquery, right?
[08:47:23] <gnarf> Wilornel: update that gist, i'll show you another optimization
[08:47:30] <gnarf> Wilornel: yeah - its pure DOM
[08:47:56] <gnarf> Wilornel: there are SOME things that are not always "safe" - luckilly this.src is pretty much always safe on an <img> :)
[08:48:09] <Wilornel> Cool :P
[08:48:11] <Wilornel> Here: https://gist.github.com/2519550
[08:50:11] <wookiehangover> ?fpi
[08:50:12] <bot-t> fucking paul irish! http://i.imgur.com/gpspl.png
[08:51:01] <gnarf> Wilornel: https://gist.github.com/2519894
[08:51:35] <gnarf> Wilornel: .on can also take an object that contains event names as keys, and handlers as functions
[08:52:19] <gnarf> Wilornel: sorry bad syntax there
[08:52:44] <gnarf> Wilornel: fixed https://gist.github.com/2519894
[08:53:19] <Wilornel> wait, keys?
[08:53:23] <gnarf> Wilornel: also, you can define your handlers as real, named functions and just reference them from your on... it makes more sense sometimes
[08:53:44] <Wilornel> like var someFunc = function(){ ... }
[08:53:56] <Wilornel> ?
[08:54:42] <gnarf> Wilornel: sure https://gist.github.com/2519894
[08:54:53] <gnarf> Wilornel: i personally prefer using function statements
[08:54:57] <gnarf> function named() {}
[08:55:01] <PhonicUK> Anyone know how I can discover the 'options' of a jquery-ui object at runtime?
[08:55:03] <gnarf> instead of var named = function() {}
[08:55:21] <gnarf> PhonicUK: .data( widgetName ).options
[08:55:21] <Wilornel> Gnarf: See what you did there? It bothers me so much! I did .on('mouseenter', and you did mouseenter: ; There are so many ways to do everything! How to know which method is the best?
[08:55:39] <PhonicUK> gnarf, does that just return a linear list of options?
[08:56:05] <gnarf> Wilornel: well, you were binding 3 events to the same object - so i made it a list of events
[08:56:24] <gnarf> organizationally, that makes sense past one or two
[08:56:35] <gnarf> PhonicUK: its an object
[08:56:56] <gnarf> PhonicUK: i have no idea what a "linear list" is in JS
[08:56:57] <PhonicUK> righto
[08:57:04] <PhonicUK> just an array
[08:57:05] <PhonicUK> is what i meant
[08:57:16] <gnarf> why didn't you say array? :)
[08:57:21] <PhonicUK> so it'd just contain ["top", "left", "title"]...
[08:57:37] <PhonicUK> array is ambiguous :P a list is always a single dimension array
[08:57:40] <gnarf> { title: "my title" }
[08:57:51] <Wilornel> Omg gnarf: On line 6, what is that called?
[08:57:55] <gnarf> list is even more ambigous
[08:57:59] <PhonicUK> does it just return the options that have been set, or all of them?
[08:58:04] <Wilornel> you make an if statement in a variable ._.
[08:58:14] <gnarf> Wilornel: "comparison operator" aka the "ternary operator" (misnomer)
[08:58:16] <Wilornel> What level is that? Advanced?
[08:58:26] <gnarf> ?101 @Wilornel
[08:58:27] <bot-t> Wilornel, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[08:58:27] <gnarf> :)
[08:59:05] <gnarf> as offensive as you may find "101" -- eloquent is a really really solid book
[08:59:35] <Wilornel> That is js, not jquery, I see
[08:59:45] <Wilornel> But just like that, for how long have yhou been coding js?
[08:59:53] <gnarf> Wilornel: thats most languages
[09:00:06] <gnarf> Wilornel: i think C was the starter of the a ? b : c
[09:00:27] <Wilornel> Is it faster or does it just use less lines?
[09:00:40] <gnarf> and sorry, i typoed
[09:00:44] <gnarf> "conditional operator" https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[09:01:01] <gnarf> Wilornel: not usually faster, and most times its avoided in favor of redability
[09:01:08] <gnarf> Wilornel: but that was a quick and easy one
[09:01:17] <Wilornel> Oh okay I understand
[09:01:22] <Wilornel> Anyways, I have to go
[09:01:28] <Wilornel> Thanks alot for the help :P
[09:01:30] <gnarf> np
[09:01:35] <Wilornel> Also, I bookmarked your two gists :P
[09:01:45] <Wilornel> See you later
[09:02:00] <gnarf> PhonicUK: all of them
[09:02:05] <gnarf> PhonicUK: at this point see ?tias ;)
[09:02:05] <PhonicUK> awesome
[09:02:06] <bot-t> PhonicUK, Try It And See
[09:02:15] <PhonicUK> indeed xD
[09:03:19] <srj55> Can anyone recommend a good jq plugin that will take an <img> and optimally resize it to fit the screen (or div/iframe)
[09:04:36] <gnarf> srj55: pure css?
[09:04:57] <gnarf> srj55: max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; ?
[09:06:53] <srj55> gnarf: no, that won't force it to a larger size than the actual img size
[09:16:57] <Wilornel> srj55: position: absolute;
[09:17:11] <kinesis> why doesnt this work
[09:17:13] <kinesis> http://pastebin.com/1jByP9Vr
[09:18:14] <srj55> Wilornel: didn't help, but I did find  jquery-imagefit-plugin
[09:19:58] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @kinesis
[09:19:58] <bot-t> kinesis, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS.

[09:20:10] <kinesis> ook
[09:27:15] <gnarf> kinesis: maybe because the first hover bind is setting the background to grey on mouseenter and mouseleave - so since you have it duplicated a few lines below, remove it?

[09:33:50] <PhonicUK> anyone know if there's a jquery-ui based addon that provides jquery-ui objects for the standard elements?
[09:33:59] <PhonicUK> things like a dropdown box
[09:40:09] <vpv4oo> why isnt it possible to load scripts like the google maps api dynamically with getScript() or inside html with load() ?
[09:40:32] <vpv4oo> do i really have to load the script in the pages main header for each part even though its only needed on one of them?
[09:50:32] <PhonicUK> on a click() event, how can i find out which was the top-most object?
[09:50:40] <PhonicUK> so that the click isn't sent to parent objects
[09:50:46] <PhonicUK> or i can otherwise filter out parent objects
[10:02:49] <LukeNukem> hey
[10:03:47] <LukeNukem> um i forgot, what was the alternative for document.getElementById('my_form').target = 'my_iframe';
[10:03:48] <LukeNukem> in jquery
[10:06:36] <wanderingi> http://pastebin.ca/2141801
[10:06:49] <wanderingi> i have that code but the while loop only calls checkstatus once
[10:07:10] <wanderingi> Why would it not call it until it doesnt return X
[10:11:52] <LukeNukem> wanderingi, checking gimme a sec
[10:12:01] <wanderingi> LukeNukem: thanks
[10:12:30] <PhonicUK> hmm
[10:12:32] <sht1144> Hey .. i am using jquery tools... cant seem to figure out how to disable a tab ..
[10:13:13] <LukeNukem> wanderingi, so you want it to do an ajax request as long as result = X?
[10:13:17] <LukeNukem> "X"
[10:13:43] <wanderingi> Yes
[10:13:55] <LukeNukem> just for checking, put the alert(result) inside the loop
[10:14:19] <wanderingi> LukeNukem: it only gets alerted once
[10:14:41] <LukeNukem> wanderingi, can i PM
[10:14:51] <wanderingi> LukeNukem: yes
[10:17:16] <PhonicUK> hmm
[10:17:18] <PhonicUK> $.data(object).options doesn't appear to work
[10:37:36] <devnill> is there a way to call a function when an object changes?
[10:37:55] <Slartibart> Anyone here knows how to use multiple - nested - tab sections with jQueryUI Tabs? I have 1 root section and 2 sub sections, and I'm unable to come with anything but making three calls to .tabs(). Is it possible to initiate multiple sections like that "together"?
[10:39:36] <Slartibart> devnill: Somehow make a setter for the object, and call a function from there?
[10:40:04] <devnill> that would work
[10:42:51] <rained23> Hi, I want to know how can I store this into a variable then reuse it back inside a jquery function .
[10:43:41] <rained23> can I just use var a = this , then use $(a).function
[10:45:43] <jcp_> $this = $(this)
[10:46:51] <rained23> do you mean var a = $(this) ? so I can reuse a.hide(); as example to $(this) ?
[10:47:36] <rained23> or I can do it like this ? var a = this; then to reuse it I use $(a).hide(); as example ....
[10:48:51] <lmao25> http://pastebin.com/pRAW8Wu1 <-- how come that doesn't actually POST anything?
[10:48:58] <lmao25> is it because the post request is too big?
[10:50:33] <rained23> lmao25: what you get from the server side ..
[10:50:57] <LukeNukem> Can someone help me with file upload over iframe(Please dont suggest me plugin!)
[10:50:59] <LukeNukem> This is my code
[10:51:35] <LukeNukem> http://notey.it/n/ZmU
[10:51:57] <LukeNukem> var_dump($_POST) from php gives empty array so its probably because the post stuff is not going to the php file
[11:04:22] <tsavory> $inBox.append($("<div style='width:" + (Math.floor(100 / numCols))+ "%; float: " + options.columnFloat + ";'></div>")); //"  creates element.style  for two columns element.style{width:50%; float:left;}  I need to over write this with .first.column {width:48%;} witch works if I do it with .first.column{width:48% !important;} how can over write this without the !important?
[11:15:11] <PhonicUK> who wants to see something awesome for jquery that I'm working on?
[11:16:15] <samzhao_> hi everyone!
[11:20:58] <samzhao_> how do you guys go about making an ajax shopping cart with quick shop feature where you click on an item and a lightbox or some sort pops up showing the brief of the item?
[11:25:33] <K3|Chris> isn't it always tricky doing JS/Ajax e-commerce stuff? if there isn't some server side validation etc
[11:29:02] <Entomo> samzhao_, I usually keep a hidden <div> and when the user clicks it, populate it via ajax and display it.  Rehide when done.
[11:29:14] <Entomo> There's likely a better way, though.
[11:29:55] <samzhao_> K3|Chris: there will be server side stuff. I think one way of doing it is using JSON, but that's only what I think; I have no idea whether that's actually how people do it in real life
[11:30:35] <K3|Chris> friend of mine spotted a web store that did all their ordering in JS and used a validation token to verify it was correct, he copied the token and changed the price to 0
[11:30:37] <K3|Chris> worked
[11:30:46] <samzhao_> Entomo: so you'd have to have all the information for all the items on the page ready on the first load?
[11:30:56] <K3|Chris> he got an angry email about that
[11:31:13] <K3|Chris> he offered to help them fix it if they let him keep the item =P
[11:31:42] <sht1144> how do you disable a tab using jquery tools ?
[11:31:44] <samzhao_> K3|Chris: ya i totally went through that. but it was an experiment so no big deal
[11:32:06] <Entomo> no, samzhao_ . The div is initially empty.
[11:32:09] <samzhao_> K3|Chris: lol I would definitely offer him all the items
[11:32:10] <Entomo> Hold on.....
[11:33:01] <samzhao_> Entomo: I think you are talking about the way of doing lightbox
[11:33:16] <Entomo> yes
[11:33:18] <samzhao_> what I'm asking is how you can get the data into the lightbox
[11:33:30] <Entomo> I'm gonna show you....
[11:33:32] <samzhao_> whether via JSON or some other ways
[11:33:42] <samzhao_> Entomo: that's great! thanks
[11:42:07] <rained23> Is that something that I add using jQuery  cannot be selected ? Example I change a content using .html() , because right now, my button didnt fire any event ...
[11:43:51] <samzhao_> rained23: use delegate
[11:44:50] <rained23> samzhao_: what do you mean ? do you means use delegate for my event listener ?
[11:45:25] <rained23> samzhao_: I use $("newItem").on("click" function(){}); right now ...
[11:48:21] <samzhao_> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:49:12] <samzhao_> use $(parent).delegate(child, 'click', function(){});
[11:50:27] <rained23> samzhao_: I got it, I need to delegate the new added dom, anyway thanks for you solution, I'm using $("parent").on("click","selector", function(){}); now ...
[11:51:19] <rained23> samzhao_: I'm searching for the delegate actually just don't know the use of it and the term of delegate is new to me .... Thanks anyway ...
[11:53:57] <samzhao_> rained23: um since the button element is created on the fly after the DOM is ready, so you need to delegate
[11:55:29] <systemfault> rained23: delegate() which is a function that has been replaced with .on() uses a technique called "Event Delegation"
[11:56:14] <samzhao_> hey systemfault
[11:56:19] <samzhao_> long time no see
[11:56:32] <systemfault> samzhao_: Yeah, I've been busy :(
[11:56:48] <samzhao_> you have no idea who I am, right? lol
[11:56:55] <rained23> samzhao_: Yeah, I know about it that the DOM that added are not inside the source code, but changed by Javascript, that why it can't trigger my event. But I dont know how to tell you all because I don't know the term delegate before :) ... anyway thank you very much, it help me alot :) . I just know the concept but can tell the term ...
[11:57:11] <systemfault> samzhao_: I don't remember your nickname to be honest
[11:57:13] <rained23> systemfault: Thanks ..
[11:57:53] <samzhao_> systemfault: it's no problemo. why so serious
[11:58:14] <samzhao_> and rained23 doesn't seemt to get it
[11:58:22] <samzhao_> *seem
[11:59:01] <systemfault> rained23: Are you familiar with the whole "event bubbling" concept?
[11:59:36] <systemfault> samzhao_: Ok :P I wont be so serious ;)
[11:59:50] <rained23> systemfault: Yeah ... maybe my english are too bad, so you didn't understand me haha.. I'm sorry for it . Anyway, it solve my biggest problems now :)
[12:00:11] <samzhao_> rained23: as long as the problem's solved
[12:01:43] <samzhao_> systemfault: but seriously, how do you do an ajax quickshop?
[12:01:53] <rained23> Long before, I use .load() ,to a page because I have some jquery function for that page, but it didnt work if I added it using .html() , so I use .load() to enable my jquery for the new element added. :)
[12:01:54] <systemfault> samzhao_: What's that?
[12:03:02] <samzhao_> systemfault: like you know some ecommerce sites have this fancy quickshop thing where you click on an item and the item details pops up in a lightbox
[12:03:56] <samzhao_> and then you can add it to cart or read more about it or what have you
[12:04:45] <PhonicUK> http://i.imgur.com/NrBw3.png << now what could I be up to... ;)
[12:05:09] <systemfault> I would load the details "on demand" via a server service that returns JSON and I'll probably build the content client-side with some template.
[12:05:17] <systemfault> samzhao_: ^
[12:08:11] <samzhao_> systemfault: so you are gonna use JSON. I was thinking of using JSON, but I just don't know if it's the standard way of doing it in an ecommerce site
[12:08:41] <samzhao_> PhonicUK: you doing a code editor or what?
[12:09:48] <PhonicUK> samzhao_, that's the plan
[12:09:55] <PhonicUK> to build a complete IDE for web-based jquery powered apps
[12:10:17] <PhonicUK> drag a button onto the dialog, double click it, be presented with a code editor for that default evnet
[12:10:19] <PhonicUK> *event
[12:10:49] <samzhao_> good luck on that then
[12:11:20] <PhonicUK> ive got a nice mechanism for serializing/deserializing the UI that you build
[12:12:32] <samzhao_> awesome, can't wait to see it
[12:23:47] <kinesis> How do I get this to work? http://jsfiddle.net/4XyzJ/
[12:24:04] <kinesis> woops its broken, sec
[12:24:35] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/4XyzJ/2/
[12:24:40] <kinesis> whoa it works
[12:24:42] <kinesis> weird
[12:29:52] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/4XyzJ/5/
[12:30:23] <PhonicUK> what's the best way of getting a 'useful' locale-specific time string?
[12:30:36] <PhonicUK> i just want the date and time, not the timezone or anything else :\
[12:35:49] <raj> why can't I simulate a click of a input file button in IE?
[12:45:14] <ZeuZ> Is there any way to use a wildcard when matching a selector? Like "button_delete_*" to select all button_delete_n number of buttons?
[12:56:02] <wanderingi> i keep getting an "l.attr is not a function" error in my javascript but it tells me it is in the jquery code. any one able to point me in the direction of what i might be doing wrong?
[12:57:12] <systemfault> wanderingi: The object you're trying to call it on is not a jquery object ?
[13:00:58] <austinlallen> Hello everyone :)
[13:05:15] <austinallen> Hello Everybody!
[13:05:59] <shoky> HI
[13:06:37] <austinallen> I just learned The JQuery javascript library and I'm glad to finally be a part of the community :)
[13:07:08] <shoky> welcome
[13:07:22] <imsky> austinallen, got a website?
[13:07:22] <bot-t> (15 hours 50 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky HWERE ARE YOU IM TRYING TO FIND THE BALLMER PEAK
[13:07:54] <austinallen> So, how long have you been Writing in query shoky?
[13:08:12] <shoky> maybe 6 months
[13:08:30] <austinallen> Ahh, Do you enjoy it so far?
[13:08:36] <shoky> sure do
[13:09:17] <austinallen> Me Too, JQuery is perhaps my favorite Javascript Library :)
[13:09:30] <austinallen> Better than the old Javascript
[13:09:45] <systemfault> jQuery is Javascript...
[13:09:48] <shoky> got a website?
[13:10:13] <austinallen> Im working on a site, haven't really had the time
[13:10:47] <imsky> 6 months shoky?
[13:10:54] <imsky> damn i think i've seen you here longer than that
[13:11:08] <austinallen> lol
[13:11:08] <shoky> huh i've been here maybe a month
[13:11:33] <austinallen> This is my first time joining this server
[13:13:02] <shoky> what is your favorite jquery function??
[13:13:11] <systemfault> Hmm… weird question
[13:13:15] <shoky> yes!
[13:13:16] <austinallen> hmm…
[13:13:20] <systemfault> $() I guess
[13:13:23] <Dr-Bombay> what is this, fanboy hour
[13:13:25] <titosantana> Is anyone familiar with query UI autocomplete? I am trying to avoid excessive remote queries where each time I type a letter it trys to do another query vs just filtering the initial results
[13:13:45] <shoky> i'm just flowing with the people
[13:13:49] <austinallen> I agree with system fault, can't get more powerful than that..
[13:13:58] <shoky> yes i agree $() is powerful
[13:14:22] <shoky> but then..........  .text() is also nice.
[13:14:32] <shoky> wait what about .attr() ....
[13:14:33] <austinallen> Yeah, its indeed handy
[13:14:41] <austinallen> .val()?
[13:14:46] <shoky> yes please
[13:14:54] <austinallen> i like .hide() and .show()
[13:15:01] <shoky> oh how could i forget those
[13:15:01] <systemfault> I hate them
[13:15:13] <austinallen> I guess thats perhaps my most "Playful" one
[13:15:28] <shoky> u must checkout .toggle() !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[13:15:34] <shoky> if u like being playful.
[13:15:47] <shoky> OK SORI I M DONE.
[13:15:51] <austinallen> not that familiar with .toggle()
[13:15:55] <shoky> awwwww man
[13:16:01] <shoky> it's the shitz
[13:16:07] <Brodingo_> dat $
[13:16:13] <systemfault> .promise is powerful
[13:16:15] <austinallen> oh wait, yes i have...
[13:16:15] <Brodingo_> .data() is baller
[13:16:35] <austinallen> i like $.ajax()
[13:16:49] <shoky> i like $.getElementById()
[13:16:49] <Dr-Bombay> GET OUT
[13:17:04] <shoky> WE ARE HERE TO STAY
[13:17:20] <austinallen> i used to like getElementById(), until i learned JQuery.
[13:17:44] <shoky> jquery makes you forget your friends
[13:18:08] <austinallen> query makes me lazy sometimes which isn't the best thing, but you know..
[13:18:24] <shoky> being lazy is the best trait a programmer can have
[13:18:35] <Mr_Grim> anyone use scrollable from jquery uitools? I am wondering if its possible to execute a callback function when the scrolling finished. any sugestions?
[13:19:02] <austinallen> Hmm… let me think Mr_Grim
[13:19:42] <austinallen> I'm not that familiar with UI
[13:19:59] <austinallen> UI is more of a hobby really.
[13:20:26] <Mr_Grim> client is asking me to do something
[13:20:33] <Mr_Grim> hmm
[13:20:35] <shoky> jqui scrollable?
[13:20:37] <Mr_Grim> actually i have another question then
[13:20:51] <Whirl3d> jQuery doesn't _make_ anyone lazy...it just makes it _easier_ for lazy people to get by with the bare minimum. Other's use that liberty to expand their development...at least that's been my observation... lol
[13:21:06] <systemfault> Same
[13:21:15] <Mr_Grim> yeah its jqui scrollable. if i cant execute a callback when the scrolling finished, i could execute something on a timer perhaps. i need to focus in on textfield when the scrolling finished.
[13:21:16] <austinallen> Yeah, i guess so
[13:21:45] <systemfault> I use jquery mainly because it normalizes browser idiosyncrasies.
[13:21:50] <Mr_Grim> would be be possible to easily focus in on a textbox with a countdown timer? is that difficult to do?
[13:21:55] <Whirl3d> that being said, make no mistake that I am a lazy fat bastard at times...unapologetic at that.
[13:22:03] <austinallen> But when working with Plain Javascript, you are always tempted to use jquery
[13:22:14] <systemfault> Mr_Grim: Select the textbox node then call .focus() on it
[13:22:17] <Whirl3d> but systemfault, I agree. I love jQuery's cross browseredness.
[13:22:33] <Whirl3d> jquery is plain javascript
[13:22:41] <austinallen> JQuery + Javascript + HTML = HTML7, not kidding
[13:22:50] <Mr_Grim> systemfault i can call focus but it screws up the scroll animation.
[13:22:58] <PhonicUK> anyone know a good plugin for doing live syntax highlighting?
[13:23:05] <systemfault> austinallen: Javascript is not the problem… Javascript interface to the browser is, it's called the "DOM"
[13:23:07] <Mr_Grim> if i could focus 1 second after the scrolling starts then im good
[13:23:27] <systemfault> austinallen: jQuery is a library that makes the DOM easier to use
[13:23:39] <austinallen> ik that lol
[13:24:12] <shoky> Mr_Grim:  scrollable has events you can bind to
[13:24:20] <Mr_Grim> where are the docs?
[13:24:26] <shoky> and its not jquery ui
[13:24:29] <Mr_Grim> perhaps thats what is was
[13:24:31] <Mr_Grim> it was
[13:24:36] <shoky> jquery ui doesnt have scrollable
[13:24:40] <shoky> its jquery tools
[13:24:45] <Mr_Grim> yes sorry
[13:24:48] <shoky> and here are the docs http://jquerytools.org/documentation/scrollable/index.html
[13:24:53] <Mr_Grim> i got the name of the lib screwed up
[13:25:13] <austinallen> Wow, its so hard to find a GOOD text editor for OSX
[13:25:27] <systemfault> austinallen: What?
[13:25:32] <Brodingo_> austinallen textwrangler is free on the app store
[13:25:35] <systemfault> austinallen: All the good editors ARE for OSX
[13:25:41] <Brodingo_> and yeah that
[13:25:58] <austinallen> Not in my opinion, i just love notepad++
[13:26:02] <systemfault> austinallen: MacVim, TextMate, Sublime… etc..
[13:26:16] <austinallen> I use text mate, i think its the closest to notepad++
[13:26:33] <systemfault> I'm a fan of Vim, I wish I could use it more..
[13:26:47] <austinallen> hmm, never heard of Vim
[13:27:01] <austinallen> I do know for a fact, Dreamweaver sucks..
[13:27:08] <systemfault> austinallen: Good :)
[13:27:11] <systemfault> It does.
[13:27:26] <austinallen> Im glad I'm not the only one who hates it
[13:27:32] <austinallen> Its a pain
[13:31:05] <waldmeister> how can I check http code/headers for an iframe? I want to check if the call was successful or note.g. 200 or 404
[13:32:10] <Whirl3d> vim is sufferage for the sake of peer integrity. it's like an artist refusing to use commerical paint to make a statement about how good their art is.
[13:32:40] <shoky> hey Whirl3d
[13:32:43] <shoky> msg for you:
[13:32:44] <shoky> <wodemaye__> If anyone sees Whirl3d around tonight, can they please check if he's gotten my PMs?  I don't know why he wouldn't, he just might not notice them if he's afk at the exact time that they're sent depending on how his client is configured.  Anyone who plans to stay on for a significant chunk of the night, would you mind just giving me a nod of some sort so I know someone's seen this at least before i go to bed? thanks.
[13:32:46] <Whirl3d> lol
[13:32:55] <Whirl3d> Thanks.
[13:33:04] <Whirl3d> I appreciate the message. I contacted him.
[13:33:16] <shoky> he pm'd me to make sure i deliver it :)
[13:33:40] <Whirl3d> I really appreciate that. I'll let him know you made good on your promise.
[13:33:41] <imsky> shoky you can use bot-t
[13:33:48] <shoky> true
[13:34:05] <shoky> tell imsky omg u talked
[13:34:14] <imsky> what
[13:34:16] <shoky> bot-t, tell imsky omg u talked
[13:34:16] <bot-t> shoky, Okay.
[13:34:26] <shoky> what
[13:34:50] <Whirl3d> I figured for sure that systemfault would have some witty reply to my comment about vim, admittedly it was inflammatory--hoping to stir up a discussion about why Vim is so popular when it appears to be so lackluster
[13:34:52] <gf3> Notepad++ has a gross interface
[13:34:58] <shoky> agreed
[13:35:05] <austinallen> i like it honestly
[13:35:08] <imsky> notepad++ has been broken since some upgrades some time ago
[13:35:09] <bot-t> (52 secs ago) <shoky> tell imsky omg u talked
[13:35:15] <gf3> Well you are wrong, austinallen.
[13:35:19] <gf3> You cannot like it.
[13:35:35] <austinallen> i like the actual editing part of it, not really the ui
[13:35:46] <systemfault> Whirl3d: It's very powerfull because it treats works as "objects" and instead of editing text, you do "motions" to modify them
[13:35:58] <gf3> Whirl3d: Vim is a secure and healthy investment with generous payback.
[13:36:05] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Vim can be difficult to use.. that's its downside
[13:36:30] <austinallen> Im in the debate of whether to use BBedit of Textmate, i can't decide
[13:36:36] <austinallen> or*
[13:36:37] <systemfault> austinallen: Textmate
[13:36:50] <Brodingo_> nano
[13:36:53] <gf3> austinallen: Also be sure to check out Chocolat
[13:36:56] <Whirl3d> bbedit is still around?
[13:36:57] <austinallen> Editing Text: Textmate User interface: BBedit
[13:37:00] <Brodingo_> real men use nano
[13:37:06] <Whirl3d> lol
[13:37:15] <systemfault> Brodingo: Real men use cat
[13:37:20] <austinallen> Yes, BBedit is sticking around, i kinda like it :)
[13:37:21] <Brodingo_> real men punch those little card thingies
[13:37:28] <Whirl3d> what about a wysiwyg interface for those of us who suck at css implementation?
[13:37:37] <systemfault> Real men write their javascript with a hex editor
[13:37:40] <imsky> real men use cat?
[13:37:44] <austinallen> i just like plain Text editors
[13:37:44] <Whirl3d> <--have programmed with punchcards...
[13:37:45] <imsky> how
[13:37:57] <Brodingo_> hahhaha 011100101001010010? more like 00100100110101010!!!!!!! HAHAHA
[13:37:58] <gf3> This is my analogy, Vim is like CSS and JS for your code. Instead of simply typing out everything, you provide it with a CSS selector (motion) and a JS function (command) to manipulate your code.
[13:38:03] <gf3> That is its power.
[13:38:22] <imsky> but how do you quit it lol
[13:38:26] <systemfault> imsky: cat > myJavascript.js                 write then ctrl+d
[13:38:39] <austinallen> I like Textmate because it actually supports Code Coloring in Jquery ;D
[13:38:40] <imsky> oh ok
[13:38:43] <Whirl3d> obviously...
[13:39:35] <gf3> And mastering these motions and commands make you a very efficient code manipulator.
[13:39:50] <imsky> one wonders
[13:39:55] <Whirl3d> i absolutely hate dreamweaver. But I couldn't live without it's (albeit shitty) wysiwyg interface for css. I do most of my coding in Aptana or NuSphere
[13:40:07] <gf3> Whirl3d: I hate you.
[13:40:13] <imsky> wouldn't the "necessity" of a "code manipulator" like vim hint at the fact that text is inefficient for programming
[13:40:20] <austinallen> lol gf3
[13:40:21] * imsky ponders
[13:40:39] <austinallen> i have dreamweaver, but i hate it
[13:40:41] <gf3> imsky: But is there something better yet?
[13:40:46] <martixy> imsky: What else would you use?
[13:40:54] <austinallen> Coda is pretty good for CSS <3
[13:40:56] <gf3> Whirl3d: Have you seen Coda's visual CSS editor?
[13:41:23] <Whirl3d> I can see where it is a good idea to learn a new paradigm to program in a language that your are an expert in (that's why people use it), but for people learing javascript, vim is a step in the wrong direction.
[13:41:29] <austinallen> Coda is awesome for The Design portion of the website
[13:41:34] <imsky> gf3 martixy you guys seen the bret victor talk?
[13:41:45] <Whirl3d> i'm not saying that it wouldn't be a benefitial step in the long run, just the wrong direction at first.
[13:41:53] <imsky> visual programming may not have a decent implementation yet, but it might in the future
[13:41:58] <austinallen> Ive switched from BBedit to Textmate, then back to BBEdit, i don't know which one i like best
[13:42:14] <imsky> but saying "look i can do repetitive stuff in vim really efficiently" is basically saying "look i'm a fast text processor"
[13:42:18] <martixy> Cant say I have
[13:42:21] <Whirl3d> I used to use UltraEdit...it has a jquery library in it as well.
[13:42:47] <gf3> imsky: Yes
[13:42:52] * Whirl3d checking out coda
[13:42:58] <austinallen> Ill have to check it out Whirl3d
[13:43:06] <gf3> imsky: Also, have you seen Lisping?
[13:43:10] <gf3> imsky: Looks amazing
[13:43:29] <martixy> imsky: you were saying?
[13:43:53] <gf3> imsky: http://slidetocode.com/
[13:44:18] <austinallen> wow, on the iPad, thats pretty awesome
[13:44:31] <gf3> Whirl3d: http://cloud.gf3.ca/GCiW
[13:45:06] <austinallen> Coda is amazing foe styling
[13:45:10] <austinallen> for*
[13:45:11] <Whirl3d> who would have ever thought that the world is going Mac? I was a mac fanboy back int he days of the Mac Plus, but out of necessity became a windows slob. Now, the best tools are mac-based and windows 8 is a joke (for destkops)
[13:45:16] <gf3> austinallen: http://chocolatapp.com/
[13:45:39] <imsky> martixy, wat
[13:46:20] <martixy> this talk you were talking about?
[13:46:33] <imsky> gf3 yeah this works for s-expressions and lisp-style stuff in general
[13:46:34] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Weird… I can MS got it this time… and I use a mac.
[13:46:41] <imsky> martixy, google it..bret victor talk
[13:47:00] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Metro is a better UI than the one from iOS will ever be.
[13:47:22] <systemfault> Whirl3d: The focus on content instead of useless stupid icons is wonderful.
[13:47:26] <austinallen> Whirl3d Hopefully, existing people with pcs who hate windows 8 will switch to Ubuntu <3
[13:47:39] <Whirl3d> metro, for the desktop, is a shabby shell script that you can run faster on windows7
[13:47:55] <Whirl3d> ubuntu suffers from MISERABLE install woes
[13:47:56] <gf3> systemfault: Except Metro is not integrated into the OS at all
[13:48:12] <shoky> win7 & debian, for me.
[13:48:13] <martixy> Right....
[13:48:17] <systemfault> gf3: I think that Windows 8 is just the beginning for MS.
[13:48:25] <systemfault> gf3: But I totally understand your point
[13:48:28] <Whirl3d> the beginning of the end, maybe
[13:48:37] <austinallen> We will have the see systemfault
[13:48:48] <gf3> systemfault: If I were MS, their current Win8Preview would have been a simple demo, not a new OS
[13:48:54] <gf3> Check this out → http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/24/2822891/windows-desktop-ui-concept
[13:49:01] <systemfault> austinallen: Yeah.. During that time, I'll continue using my mac at home… and fedora 16 at work
[13:49:10] <austinallen> Lots of consumers who are already familiar to the task bar will be frustrated
[13:49:11] <gf3> Something like that would have helped with the Metro transition
[13:49:27] <austinallen> Fedora and Ubuntu are just awesome
[13:49:27] <systemfault> austinallen: Any "change" make people frustrated...
[13:49:30] <gf3> austinallen: Yeah, but having both is not better, it's worse
[13:49:37] <systemfault> austinallen: They just need time to swallow the pill
[13:49:45] <imsky> crunchbang > *
[13:49:50] <Whirl3d> People are switching to mac left and right. At least 50% of my 30+ clients have paid me to do the switch and at least another 30% have seriously considered, and problably will switch by year end
[13:49:56] <systemfault> austinallen: See how Unity sucks on Ubuntu? Now it's starting to get praise...
[13:50:22] <austinallen> I can live with change, but some people don't want change and thats holding alot of  OS's back
[13:50:58] <systemfault> There's one thing I miss on Windows and it's VIsual C++ :P
[13:51:06] <Whirl3d> Anyone experience MS BoB?
[13:51:10] <systemfault> lol
[13:51:14] <gf3> People swallowed XP, Vista, and 7
[13:51:15] <austinallen> But the bad thing about More Macs is More Viruses
[13:51:49] <systemfault> austinallen: Not for the moment at least.
[13:52:01] <systemfault> austinallen: But I do think that Windows is more secure than Macs...
[13:52:04] <Whirl3d> That was a marketing masterpiece...it was probably the most deceptive marketing ploy every, but MS BoB was brilliant
[13:52:06] <austinallen> Nope, but it may happened in the near future
[13:52:16] <austinallen> heppen*
[13:52:25] <austinallen> happen*, can't spell today :P
[13:52:44] <systemfault> I think the only reason  why OSX doesn't have more viruses is because it's not worth it as a target (OSX it like 5% of the market)
[13:52:50] <gf3> systemfault: You think Windows is more secure than Unix?
[13:52:56] <gf3> BSD Unix
[13:52:59] <systemfault> gf3: Not unix, OSX
[13:53:06] <gf3> systemfault: OS X is BSD Unix
[13:53:11] <gf3> With a pretty face
[13:53:20] <powerc9000> is there anything more sucure than unix and linux?
[13:53:23] <imsky> ok that's just wrong
[13:53:26] <imsky> but alll right
[13:53:26] <imsky> lol
[13:53:31] <systemfault> gf3: More or less.., it's a XNU kernel with a FreeBSD userlang.
[13:53:33] <systemfault> *userland
[13:53:34] <kinesis> Why would a jsfiddle work but a index.php jquery not work
[13:53:59] <powerc9000> I use nodejs
[13:54:09] <systemfault> (XNU itself being a derivative of the Mach kernel)
[13:54:18] <systemfault> Not all *nix are created equal.
[13:54:28] <gf3> imsky: It's UNIX 03 certified…
[13:54:47] <powerc9000> what is your favorite linux flavor?
[13:55:00] <austinallen> i like GNOME
[13:55:10] <systemfault> gf3: Only Leopard was IIRC and… UNIX is just a useless and stupid specification.
[13:55:12] <austinallen> and Xfce
[13:55:56] <gf3> systemfault: I assumed it was Leopard going forward, I could be wrong though
[13:56:13] <systemfault> gf3: Well, I not sure anymore :/
[13:56:33] <Whirl3d> It's still hard to believe that there are no wysiwyg editors on Windows 7 that are better than the miseral DWCS5...
[13:56:56] <powerc9000> I like event listeners
[13:56:57] <Whirl3d> though adobe has a new one coming out soon for site-developement....right now it's slow
[13:56:59] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/4XyzJ/8/ <- why would this _not_ work if the code was copied exactly into a html file
[13:57:06] <systemfault> Whirl3d: How about using firefox or chrome?
[13:57:15] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Just use a live stylesheet
[13:57:32] <Whirl3d> firefox is dog slow and i fine tune css in chrome...
[13:57:37] <gf3> systemfault: Ahh yes, just checked, it's Leopard going forward
[13:57:45] <systemfault> gf3: Ah, good to know
[13:57:49] <gf3> So that includes all current releases
[13:58:24] <systemfault> gf3: Anyway, the thing is that Linux will never get that certification… because the certification is just a way for the opengroup to make money
[13:58:55] <gf3> Certainly, I also think Linux doesn't care
[13:59:05] <powerc9000> should I get a mac or should I just load ubuntu on a cheaper laptop I buy?
[13:59:32] <systemfault> powerc9000: If you don't have to use mac/pc only applications, you could use linux
[13:59:44] <Whirl3d> get a mac and have both
[13:59:51] <austinallen> honestly powerc9000, Ubuntu 12.04 hits the mark for me to use it on a daily basis, therefore, a good alternative to Mac OSX
[13:59:59] <systemfault> I use linux at work.. but I need a VM with photoshop… and I cannot use MS Exchange...
[14:00:07] <systemfault> I'm stuck with OWA
[14:00:17] <powerc9000> Well I was thinking that I could keep my current computer to play starcraft and other games on and then dev on linux
[14:00:30] <Whirl3d> MS Exchange is the worst app ever...omg, I hate MS Exchange.
[14:00:46] <systemfault> Whirl3d: I hate it too… but the IT guys are all wintards.
[14:00:50] <PhonicUK> anyone know of a good jquery based code editing plugin?
[14:00:51] <systemfault> (Where I work)
[14:00:55] <PhonicUK> specifically for editing javascript
[14:00:59] <gf3> What I hate about Linux WMs is the lack of consistency
[14:01:21] <gf3> There is no consistency in the UI, or between apps, or in shortcuts, etc…
[14:01:26] <systemfault> gf3: I'd blame XWindow for that...
[14:01:27] <kinesis> Why doesn't this work: http://dankchronic.com/test.html  But the same fiddle does: http://jsfiddle.net/4XyzJ/8/
[14:01:30] <powerc9000> the IT guy where I work is a total windows guy but its a hospital so some of the servers have to run apps that only run on winxp
[14:01:41] <gf3> systemfault: Me too, and the WMs
[14:02:10] <Whirl3d> systemfault, sorry to hear that. Good IT dudes are switching to Google for corporate email. I have done at least 100 businesses that way. It's so much better in every way.
[14:02:27] <powerc9000> @kinesis what is it suppsoed to be doing?
[14:02:33] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Cool :)
[14:03:47] <kinesis> its suppose to make the rows of the tbale (except the header) turn grey on mouse over
[14:03:50] <kinesis> it works in jsfiddle, try it
[14:04:05] <Whirl3d> powerc9000, not long before those apps wil be replaced, I am sure. I know a couple of big-time developers that are coding medical apps every day to replace anitquated hospital architectures with new web-standards interace-based apps
[14:04:38] <powerc9000> yea they use a crayppy system called heathland
[14:04:42] <Tasser> could you give me some good sources on how to implement drag n drop
[14:04:43] <gf3> Whirl3d: I doubt it
[14:04:48] <powerc9000> *healthland
[14:05:01] <gf3> Whirl3d: A lot of the machinery requires Windows
[14:05:16] <gf3> It's unlikely to disappear/change any time soon
[14:05:56] <Whirl3d> Grady Hospital, the biggest hospital in Atlanta, and one of the biggest in the nation, just switched to an epic-based system that is all web-based. If Grady can do it, anyone can do it.
[14:06:24] <Whirl3d> It still has tons of windows machines, but they are slaves to run the hardware
[14:06:40] <powerc9000> WINDOWS SLAVES! awesome
[14:06:50] <Whirl3d> the interface is no longer platform dependant. and shouldn't be
[14:06:54] <kinesis> its suppose to make the rows of the tbale (except the header) turn grey on mouse over
[14:06:59] <kinesis> Why doesn't this work: http://dankchronic.com/test.html  But the same fiddle does: http://jsfiddle.net/4XyzJ/8/
[14:07:08] <gf3> Whirl3d: For example, just the other week, I went in to get an ultrasound. And the actual ultrasound machine had windows embedded into it.
[14:07:17] <gf3> And, no doubt, is coupled to some custom software.
[14:07:42] <Whirl3d> that has a custom API that can be accessed via web interface.
[14:08:02] <powerc9000> @kinesis you know you can do that without jquery at all right?
[14:08:34] <kinesis> ok so remove the jquery-x.x.x-min.js?
[14:08:36] <Whirl3d> It's a huge development market right now. Creating API methods for exissting proprietary apps that allow web-interface.
[14:08:36] <kinesis> script src?
[14:08:55] <kinesis> i thought anything with $("". xyz etc was jquery
[14:09:11] <kinesis> well im using jquery in this, probably ajax
[14:09:12] <Whirl3d> kinesis, you can do it with css
[14:09:22] <kinesis> but i already wrote this, why wont it work
[14:09:35] <kinesis> would css be abetter cross-browser solution?
[14:09:39] <powerc9000> yea you can just use the css :hover to do that
[14:10:11] <Gates> leet hacks
[14:10:48] <Whirl3d> one line in your css---   table tr:hover {background-Color:"grey";}
[14:10:59] <powerc9000> I think it works in all browser ie 8+
[14:11:34] <Whirl3d> and then if you want to reward users for using REAL broswers you can add CSS3 transforms to make it fade in or pulse, for example
[14:12:04] <powerc9000> Also you can have a modal window that pops up and says congrats on being awesome
[14:12:36] <Whirl3d> * I much prefer the simulated BSOD that says your an idiot for using IE, so I crashed your PC
[14:13:17] <powerc9000> You know what that would be cool I think I may just do that for my website
[14:13:48] <elegos> hello! I've got a problem with element.show and hide. The problem is when I want to hide an element just to change text and show it again. Actually this behavior will hide immediately without animation the element, then it will be hidden (again) with the animation, instead of hiding and showing. What's the problem? This is the code: http://pastebin.com/FfA323Py
[14:14:22] <tsavory> $inBox.append($("<div style='width:" + (Math.floor(100 / numCols))+ "%; float: " + options.columnFloat + ";'></div>")); //" creates element.style for two columns element.style{width:50%; float:left;} I need to over write this with .first.column {width:48%;} witch works if I do it with .first.column{width:48% !important;} how can over write this without the !important?
[14:14:37] <Whirl3d> ? demo at tsavory
[14:14:39] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Couldn't find "demo at tsavory" in jQuery Docs.
[14:14:50] <Whirl3d> ?demo @ tsavory
[14:14:51] <bot-t> tsavory, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:14:52] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:15:06] <Whirl3d> ?fiddle@elegos
[14:15:07] <bot-t> elegos, #10785 (jQuery .html().replace breaks in IE7-8 only. Example fiddle ... - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10785
[14:15:28] <tsavory> http://heidisavory.com/?q=about
[14:15:29] <Whirl3d> elegos, if you make a working example by pastsing your code in to jsfiddle, I'll help you with it.
[14:15:37] <elegos> I'm using Chrome
[14:15:48] <elegos> ok I'm gonna show you
[14:16:06] <elegos> do you have an OpenID?
[14:17:12] <Whirl3d> tsavory, are you using jquery?
[14:17:38] <tsavory> Yes I am Whirl3d
[14:17:47] <Whirl3d> $(".column").first().width("48%") should work, shouldn't it?
[14:18:23] <Whirl3d> "column" of course being replaced with a class name that you apply to your columns.
[14:20:30] <Whirl3d> tsavory, perhaps you should update jquery
[14:20:53] <Whirl3d> sorry, I just saw drupal.
[14:21:55] <tsavory> But some pages using the jquery columnizer plugin will have more than 2 columns so needs to get it on the fly just the 2 column displays need changed so I need to beable to use css to change them   yeah its drupal and the dang update module messes with theme setttings
[14:22:22] <samzhao_> Hey Whirl3d, how are you
[14:22:50] <Whirl3d> tsavory, sounds like a #css question then
[14:23:04] <Whirl3d> hey samshao, how goes it?
[14:23:27] <elegos> does $.ready work on jsfiddle?
[14:23:37] <Whirl3d> sorry, samzhao_, fatfingered the keyboard.
[14:24:12] <tsavory> http://pastebin.com/zz9LzeWN here is a copy of the files I am using Whirl3d  they tell me to overwrite the style but nothing seems to do it other than adding !important to the CSS and that is not good practice
[14:24:14] <samzhao_> I got a question for you. Is getting data through JSON the best way to do ajax in ecommerce site?
[14:24:15] <elegos> ok Whirl3d: how can I link my "creation"?
[14:24:23] <samzhao_> Its no problem
[14:24:27] <elegos> http://jsfiddle.net/RtuWg/
[14:24:28] <Whirl3d> elegos, you don't need do (though you can) use $(document).ready....you can select "onDomReady" from the paltform menu
[14:24:48] <systemfault> samzhao_: Yeah, definitely because you can directly convert from JSON to Javascript objects
[14:25:05] <systemfault> samzhao_: You'd prefer XML?
[14:25:32] <Whirl3d> elegos, you have to wrap your callback in the first animate in a function
[14:25:47] <elegos> o'rly? cool
[14:26:14] <Whirl3d> by using it the way you did, it runs the animation immediately, looking to get a function as a callback. Instead use function () {showMessage....}
[14:26:42] <samzhao_> systemfault: I have no idea. We  talk about this earlier, but I'm just concerned if there's any security problems associated with  it
[14:27:00] <elegos> cool
[14:27:23] <systemfault> samzhao_: json is just a string, why would there be any security issue associated with it?
[14:27:28] <ZeuZ> I'm trying to use find() to determine if there's a selector allready appended to a div, finding it works, however comparing it with !=Object to NOT add it again doesn't seem to work. Ideas?
[14:27:43] <ZeuZ> In other words, what does find return if it finds nothing?
[14:27:50] <ZeuZ> Tried reading the wiki
[14:27:54] <elegos> Whirl3d: I thought that callback functions could be "pre-set" and just called as-is, why should I wrap them instead? What's the login behind it?
[14:28:01] <ZeuZ> however couldn't find a simple answer
[14:28:10] <elegos> logic*
[14:28:31] <wanderingi> http://pastebin.ca/2141852, how could i make this while loop only run once every 5 seconds http://pastebin.ca/2141852
[14:28:45] <Whirl3d> elegos. A callback function is an object of type FUNCTION basically. What you provided gets immediately evaluated and provides nothing to the Callback field.
[14:29:11] <Whirl3d> you have to provide a FUNCTION reference in the callback field.
[14:29:13] <ZeuZ> Nevermind, found a workaraound
[14:29:14] <samzhao_> systemfault: well since its a client side language after all
[14:29:18] <elegos> so if I call it directly it's being executed once it's read?
[14:29:34] <Whirl3d> So you could do var callb=function () {showMessage2(props)'})
[14:29:43] <Bonjella> Wanderingi: setIntervale? Not used it within an ajx post though
[14:29:44] <Whirl3d> or you could do just showMessage2
[14:29:58] <Whirl3d> showMessage2 is a function but showMessage2(props) is not
[14:30:15] <elegos> k thx
[14:31:34] <Ar-ras> hi, is there a jquery validator for phone numbers as itu-t e.164?
[14:32:11] <Whirl3d> so elegos, you could add a couple lines to showMessage2 that setup defaults for all of your pros for the fucntion then pass just the function name as the callback. It will be evaluted in the scope of the element you are animating
[14:33:58] <chuwiey> hi all, can someone help me understand how I would send jsonp cross-domain? right now i'm getting unexpected identifiers (basically the jsonp is being sent as part of the query)
[14:35:26] <Ar-ras> chuwiey i did jsonp crossdomain 9 month ago
[14:36:12] <Ar-ras> do you send the callbackid to your device and the result with the callbackid back?
[14:36:36] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: I do... (well jquery creates the callbackid for me... )
[14:36:51] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: the problem though is before it gets to the server
[14:37:29] <Ar-ras> what is sent back from the server?
[14:38:27] <Ar-ras> chuwiey?
[14:40:14] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: nothing is sent back from the server because it doesn't get sent. I'm getting a syntax error due to my javascript before it is sent to the server...
[14:40:39] <Ar-ras> do you have a jsfiddle?
[14:40:50] <Dexec> Gentlemen, why would this:   $(forms).eq(0)   return the correct object I want, but this:   $(forms).eq(0).find('input')   returns nothing, even though there are input elements in there?
[14:41:10] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: let me make one... one sec (and thanks)
[14:42:16] <Ar-ras> Dexec isnt $forms.eq(0) returning the htmlobject and not the jquery object?
[14:43:41] <Dexec> Ar-ras: I don't think so, had a look at this page: http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[14:43:51] <Dexec> seems to say it returns a new jQuery object
[14:44:14] <Dexec> Worked out another way to do it though which works:   $(forms[0]).find('input')
[14:44:45] <Teduardo> Hello all, i'm sure you guys are all out drinking on this fine Saturday night but I wondered if anyone wanted to help me figure out a project. Basically I have two <selects> on a form.. one of the selects has a list of operating systems, and one of the selects has RAM selections. I am trying to make it present a warning if the user selects more RAM than their OS can use.
[14:44:50] <Ar-ras> why not $('form').first().find('input')
[14:45:25] <Teduardo> The form is generated by PHP so I can present the memory limits for the OS selections via JSON
[14:45:28] <Dexec> Ar-ras: Well the 0 is actually going to be a variable "i" inside a loop
[14:46:45] <Ar-ras> Dexec the thing is that $('form').eq(0).find('input') works for me
[14:46:58] <Teduardo> anybody have any ideas?
[14:47:17] <Ar-ras> teduardo yep
[14:47:51] <Dexec> Ar-ras: Oh, well, I think my workaround will do for now. Thanks for looking! :)
[14:47:53] <Ar-ras> Teduardo you have that two selectbox thing where you move the options beetween them
[14:48:42] <Teduardo> I figured I could put an array of the memory limits with the osid => memorylimit then when the form changes evaluate whether the selected amount of memory is > the memory limit for the selected OS
[14:49:51] <Ar-ras> where do you set the memory limit?
[14:50:39] <Ar-ras> you could add to the option tags an attribute "memory" and put the memory need
[14:51:05] <Teduardo> those are in the MySQL table that PHP uses to build the form, so i could just have it pop the limits out into JSON when it builds the form
[14:51:29] <Teduardo> like an array
[14:51:58] <Ar-ras> teduardo, do you have a jsfiddle?
[14:52:13] <Teduardo> No i am just trying to get started, I am terrible with client side things.
[14:52:21] <Teduardo> I will make one
[14:54:04] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: sorry it took so long. I was having a problem putting it in a fiddle as it is a screen scraper and the data is from different pages.. I've made a pastie with the code i'm using for sending the data and an example json object i'm trying to send... http://pastebin.com/9td5s8Gv (thanks)
[14:57:43] <Tasser> what's the term for title bars that appear if I scrolled the page a bit?
[14:58:08] <chuwiey> Tasser: title bars?
[14:58:23] <Ar-ras> chuwiey hmm not so clear i think
[14:59:16] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: ?
[15:00:03] <Ar-ras> why do you json stringify and suppress processData?
[15:00:44] <Ar-ras> chuwiey do you let serverside read the data as json?
[15:02:27] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: I json stringify to turn the data obj into json. I added the processData suppression by mistake I will remove it. Yes, the server-side reads the data as json. My problem isn't on the server side though - it is an unexpected identifier originating from the query the $.ajax is producing
[15:03:29] <Ar-ras> chuwiey well i would guess
[15:03:38] <Tasser> chuwiey, http://www.20min.ch/ <- scroll a bit
[15:04:00] <Ar-ras> success should be maybe a function
[15:04:06] <Tasser> except instead of the one that appears, I'd like to use the one that already exists
[15:04:11] <Ar-ras> or you have some invisible code
[15:04:38] <remlabm> hello, i see there is an option for $.ajaxPrefilter, my goal is to have a "post filter". looks like $.ajaxSuccess() is what im looking for but for some reason im not getting the data back
[15:04:56] <Ar-ras> tasser the div has class "micropanel"
[15:04:56] <Ar-ras> :D
[15:05:45] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: well... the unexpected idenitifier isn't coming from that... it's a problem in the actual data being prepared by JSON.stringify()
[15:05:57] <remlabm> basically i want the ability to look at every ajax response before it gets passed to the $.ajax() request
[15:05:57] <Tasser> Ar-ras, oh ^^
[15:07:26] <Ar-ras> chuwiey the thing is
[15:08:03] <Ar-ras> you send data to the server by GET
[15:08:12] <Ar-ras> but you dont say the GETVariable
[15:08:56] <Ar-ras> if you could use "PUT", then you could send it directly by PUT-Method.
[15:08:57] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: how do you mean?
[15:09:25] <chuwiey> I don't mind which way i send it really, as long as the jsonp data gets there...
[15:09:37] <Ar-ras> you know
[15:09:43] <Ar-ras> like
[15:09:55] <Ar-ras> localhost/index.php?key=value
[15:10:20] <Ar-ras> but now it is only localhost/index.php?value
[15:11:04] <Ar-ras> thats why your stringify makes the mistake
[15:11:11] <Ar-ras> because if you remove that
[15:11:23] <Ar-ras> you send the data correctly
[15:11:40] <Ar-ras> well i go eat
[15:11:50] <chuwiey> Ar-ras: thanks for helping.. bon apetite
[15:12:20] <PhonicUK> does anyone know a menubar plugin that plays nicely with jquery dialogs?
[15:13:41] <someprimetime> how can i find out when the nextline was reached in a textarea?
[15:13:55] <someprimetime> like say you're typing and it goes to the next line... how can i determine that?
[15:14:08] <someprimetime> obviously a `return` keypress would trigger it
[15:14:40] <PhonicUK> someprimetime, on a keypress, get the position of the cursor, subtract 1, take that position in the string value and see if its \n
[15:14:54] <someprimetime> PhonicUK: damn son thanks
[15:21:09] <Tasser> can I duplicate a dom element?
[15:21:32] <Tasser> wait, ids
[15:23:07] <krazyj> hey folks… with jquery (ui), i'm trying to make a group of divs draggable. is there any way to bind that to a class-level attribute, instead of id-level (i.e. for each individual div)?
[15:24:20] <wanderingi> http://pastebin.ca/2141858 i am trying to make sure that the ajax success code only happens once every 10 seconds, but it is happening constantly at the minute, what am I doing wrong?
[15:39:53] <zeta-> I've been using .has("input") but I only want 1 level deep. Is there another function?
[15:42:18] <Tasser> how do I get the raw elements of a $() ?
[15:43:39] <Whirl3d> .get
[15:43:45] <Cluber> I am getting the error "item is undefined in bootstrap-typeahead.js Line 104" for this test case, http://pastebin.com/Zj7iruN1 - Any ideas why?
[15:47:34] <zeta-> .children("input") gives me the input elements -- I want their parent.
[15:49:24] <PhonicUK> http://i.imgur.com/YWWss.png :)
[15:50:41] <Cluber> PhonicUK: what program is that
[15:50:56] <PhonicUK> Cluber, that's something I'm working on, built using jquery-ui
[15:51:11] <PhonicUK> that's running in a browser :)
[15:51:34] <Cluber> A UI to create jquery UI's?
[15:51:45] <PhonicUK> nope, an IDE to create jquery applicatioons :)
[15:51:54] <Cluber> yes, cool.
[15:51:54] <PhonicUK> as in you'll put the code in it as well
[15:52:19] <PhonicUK> double click on a button, get taken to a code editor to start writing the code for that buttons click event
[15:52:26] <Kottizen> reminds me of Dreamviewer and Frontpage
[15:52:42] <Kottizen> how much are you going to charge for people to use it?
[15:52:53] <PhonicUK> not sure yet
[15:53:10] <PhonicUK> there's going to be a bunch of server-side stuff to let you do a few extra things
[15:53:18] <Kottizen> ah
[15:53:22] <PhonicUK> cross-domain JSON requests etc
[15:53:55] <Wilornel> Guys, should var rel = $(this).parent().attr('rel'); work?
[15:54:11] <PhonicUK> Wilornel, i see nothing wrong with that
[15:54:22] <PhonicUK> so long as this has a parent and that parent has a rel attribute
[15:54:40] <Wilornel> I have no errors, but the variable is undefined when I use breakpoints...
[15:54:47] <Wilornel> one sec
[15:55:27] <PhonicUK> Kottizen, I think I'm going to make it free to build the applications and test them, a very small number of 'free' monthly users, and charge based on application usage volume
[15:55:30] <PhonicUK> i think its a viable business
[15:56:16] <Wilornel> <div class="star" rel="8"><img class="starImg" src="images/starup.png"></div>
[15:56:21] <Wilornel> the image is the this'
[15:56:29] <PhonicUK> Wilornel, image is missing its closing tab
[15:56:31] <PhonicUK> *tag
[15:57:59] <Wilornel> That is weird
[15:58:02] <Wilornel> the slash?
[15:58:06] <PhonicUK> yeah

[15:59:01] <Teduardo> Hi, can someone take a look at this fiddle real quick and make any suggestions on how I can achieve my goal? =D http://jsfiddle.net/BzLcf/1/
[15:59:05] <Wilornel> Well that is not normal, cuz In the script I wrote a slash!
[15:59:16] <zeta-> like <br />
[15:59:46] <Wilornel> PhonicUK
[15:59:51] <Wilornel> What is happenning?
[16:02:22] <StevenCodes> is there any americans that like NBA still lol
[16:02:55] <Wilornel> basketball?
[16:03:02] <StevenCodes> hells yeah
[16:08:57] <Teduardo> can you specify multiple fields in a statement like this?
[16:08:57] <Teduardo> $("#os").change(function ()
[16:09:11] <Teduardo> like $("#os", "#ram") ?
[16:09:17] <sneakyness> Teduardo: try it and see
[16:09:26] <shoky> $("#os,#ram")

[16:21:12] <Monkeypaws> im not closing out the function or i'm doing something else horribly wrong
[16:22:25] <Teduardo> can anyone take a real quick look at my script.. i'm sure i did it wrong because i'm a newb

[16:23:35] <Teduardo> basically, if someone picks '2TB' and Windows 2008 x86 it should warn them...
[16:24:21] <systemfault> Teduardo: You should always use a development console...
[16:24:36] <systemfault> Teduardo: Because your error is stupidly obvious with it.
[16:24:41] <zeta-> Monkeypaws: final ) doesn't have a ( to match
[16:24:52] <Teduardo> ah which one is good for windows 7? i just use notepad
[16:25:03] <Wilornel> LOL
[16:25:03] <systemfault> Teduardo: The chrome dev tools
[16:25:16] <Wilornel> Teduardo: Use textPad or eclipse for coding
[16:25:25] <Wilornel> For debugging, what is your browser??
[16:25:36] <systemfault> Teduardo: You can still develop in notepad if that's what you like… but you need development tools to debug
[16:26:04] <Teduardo> i use ie9, i dont do very much client side stuff for the obvious reason that im horrible
[16:26:04] <Wilornel> Teduardo: Your browser?
[16:26:14] <Wilornel> Well
[16:26:17] <Wilornel> Get chrome
[16:26:24] <Monkeypaws> zeta - so i should delete the last ) on line 15?
[16:26:27] <systemfault> Teduardo: Don't use IE to develop, the dev tools are bad in that browser
[16:26:35] <Monkeypaws> zeta - thats not workin :(
[16:26:59] <Wilornel> Monkeypaws: I think he wants you to add a (
[16:27:00] <Teduardo> okay I have chrome, it doesnt seem to have a js editor built into it from what I can see, i'll poke aorund a bit
[16:27:01] <systemfault> Teduardo: Anyway… see the .change line, the error is the ; before
[16:27:14] <systemfault> Teduardo: ctrl+shift+j in chrome
[16:27:20] <Wilornel> that &
[16:27:22] <Wilornel> that ^
[16:27:47] <Monkeypaws> Wilornel - hrm where would i add a )?
[16:27:50] <Monkeypaws> i mean (
[16:27:56] <Wilornel> Give me the code
[16:28:12] <Monkeypaws> http://pastebin.com/hAB5FLdN
[16:28:33] <Wilornel> systemfault: Is it normal to have an <img> without the / at the end(in the browser), even though in the files, it is <img/>
[16:28:44] <Monkeypaws> syntax error line 15
[16:28:47] <Whirl3d> what is the easiest way to get padded 0's for numbers? I tried extending the Number prototype with Number.prototype.pad=function(len) { var nlen=this.toString().length; var ztoadd=len-nlen; if (ztoadd>0) {return String.repeat("0",ztoadd)+this.toString();} else {return this.toString();}}
[16:29:00] <Teduardo> systemfault: ah, cool it kind of works! it doesn't clear the div if the error goes away tho
[16:29:07] <Teduardo> but i'll keep poking at it
[16:29:10] <zeta-> Monkeypaws: No. check all ({ etc are paired and enclose what you mean
[16:29:24] <systemfault> Wilornel: It's okay, what you see in the dev tools is the "internal" representation of the DOM tree
[16:29:32] <systemfault> Wilornel: It's not really HTML
[16:29:41] <Wilornel> systemFault: I see
[16:29:53] <systemfault> Wilornel: Also, the / at the end is only important if you write xhtml
[16:30:02] <Wilornel> Monkeypaws: I see ou did not close the .ajax, you should add }); at the very end of your script
[16:30:40] <Wilornel> systemFault, then why would this be undefined? : var id = $(this).parent().attr('rel');
[16:30:48] <Wilornel> <div class="star" rel="8"><img class="starImg" src="images/starup.png"></div>
[16:31:21] <systemfault> Wilornel: Hmm, the only way it would be possible is if "this" isn't the img tag
[16:31:36] <Wilornel> How do I check it?
[16:31:49] <systemfault> Wilornel: A console.log(this)
[16:31:54] <Wilornel> Sec
[16:32:30] <Wilornel> MonkeyPaws: Ill give you your code in a sec, it has lots of errors
[16:32:48] <Monkeypaws> its a hackjob, im sorry :( thanks
[16:33:24] <Wilornel> systemFault: it returns: <img class='starImg' src='images/stardown.png'>
[16:34:06] <systemfault> Wilornel: I don't understand why it doesn't work then… while the rel attribute doesn't make sense on a div, it should still work
[16:34:28] <systemfault> Wilornel: Do you have a jsfiddle of your code?
[16:34:34] <systemfault> Wilornel: Or even a URL
[16:34:41] <Wilornel> one sec im debugging monkeypaws stuff
[16:35:33] <Teduardo> If anyone gets a chance can you guys grade my terrible script and tell me how awful it is? http://jsfiddle.net/BzLcf/4/ it works as I want it to =)
[16:36:41] <Teduardo> I'm just pretty sure it is probably broken in some way I dont understand =)
[16:37:00] <systemfault> Wilornel: http://jsfiddle.net/nVX53/  :P
[16:37:19] <Whirl3d> Teduardo, unfamiliar with jsfiddle?
[16:37:26] <shoky> Teduardo first of all get your fiddles straight: http://jsfiddle.net/BzLcf/5/
[16:37:35] <Wilornel> Monkeypaws: use gist, and tabulations... and Eclipse if you want, its a great editor
[16:37:38] <Wilornel> Here is the code
[16:37:38] <Wilornel> https://gist.github.com/2522641
[16:37:48] <Wilornel> Ask here again if there are any problems
[16:37:58] <Wilornel> Btw, I just closed the baquets and ()
[16:38:03] <james13433> Hello jquery
[16:39:03] <Monkeypaws> thanks, are those free ?
[16:39:10] <james13433> I need to pass /test?qtys[110]=2&qtys[323]=7 this into a query ajax post, how would I do that?
[16:39:22] <Wilornel> systemFault: Weird...
[16:39:26] <james13433> basically an array with keys and values
[16:39:47] <Wilornel> Monkeypaws: Gist: gist.github.com, its like pastebin but better
[16:40:05] <Wilornel> tabulations are just things that organize your text, usually when you press TAB
[16:40:06] <systemfault> james13433: Why don't you pass them in the request body?
[16:40:19] <james13433> so what now?
[16:40:22] <james13433> so what now*
[16:40:26] <james13433> do what now*
[16:40:57] <Wilornel> monkeypaws: Elipse is free, I do not know if you will understand it though
[16:41:15] <systemfault> james13433: You can pass them with the "data" configuration attribute of the $.ajax function
[16:41:28] <systemfault> james13433: Passing get parameters to a post doesn't make much sense.
[16:41:38] <james13433> and how do I get that on the other end with php ?
[16:41:40] <Wilornel> Ok I g2g see you later gyus
[16:41:55] <systemfault> james13433: They would be in that $_POST array or something like that.
[16:42:25] <james13433> Im afraid you've confused me.
[16:42:43] <Teduardo> can you use variables in strings like you can in PHP "Hi this is a $string!!" or do you have to do var = "Hi this is a" & string
[16:42:43] <james13433> maybe it should be to a get not a post.
[16:42:58] <systemfault> james13433: Depends on what you need to do.
[16:43:23] <james13433> systemfault add a couple products to the cart then get the success/error response.
[16:43:33] <systemfault> james13433: GET being an idempotent HTTP method should not be used to do modifications on the server.
[16:43:42] <systemfault> james13433: Then you want a post.
[16:43:45] <shoky> Teduardo:  var s = "Hi this is a " + string;
[16:44:24] <systemfault> james13433: The documentation is very good http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[16:44:28] <Monkeypaws> thanks Wilornel
[16:44:35] <systemfault> james13433: Just scroll down to the examples
[16:45:57] <james13433> so something like $.post("test.php", { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"] }); but I need keys in there.
[16:46:55] <systemfault> james13433: Yeah but you already have them, no?
[16:47:03] <james13433> Yeah.
[16:47:13] <systemfault> :)
[16:47:15] <james13433> well no
[16:47:35] <james13433> I need the keys to be a products id and a value to be the qty to be added.
[16:48:18] <james13433> in that example the keys would just be random
[16:48:18] <systemfault> {'323' : 7, '102': 10} ?
[16:48:50] <james13433> well I need to do a foreach on the other end, so I
[16:48:50] <systemfault> Hmm
[16:49:24] <james13433> doesn't necercerricy have to be in that format, thats just the best I could think of to use from the php side.
[16:49:50] <systemfault> You could even send json to the server if you want
[16:50:33] <james13433> I don't think that would help in this case.
[16:51:49] <Teduardo> if you separate your jsfiddle is there a way to have it reassemble the entire script?
[16:52:02] <Teduardo> or do you just stick it back together manually
[16:57:01] <shoky> reassemble?
[17:01:27] <james13433> This does the trick, thanks system fault http://jsfiddle.net/s4ZSY/2/
[17:04:46] <systemfault> james13433: Wonderful :)
[17:04:49] <Teduardo> one last dumb question is there a way to get the text between <option>this stuff right here</option>
[17:06:19] <systemfault> I guess that you need to get the option node and use .html() on it
[17:06:33] <systemfault> You don't usually need to do that..
[17:07:02] <Teduardo> well, i'd like to make the warning message say what they selected but the value is just an ID number
[17:07:06] <Teduardo> so that wouldn't help =)
[17:08:25] <systemfault> Ah ok :) Hmm
[17:08:51] <systemfault> Perhaps $(this.options[this.selectedIndex]).html() :/ I'm not sure :'(
[17:09:04] <Teduardo> the 'value' is 123 or whatever but the stuff between <option></option> is descriptive and useful
[17:09:46] <xec> $(":selected", this).text() might do the trick
[17:09:56] <systemfault> Ah
[17:10:04] <systemfault> Cool :)
[17:11:09] <systemfault> xec's method seems to work fine: http://jsfiddle.net/XXExP/
[17:11:20] <Teduardo> this one did it
[17:11:22] <Teduardo> var thingy = $("#os option:selected").text();
[17:13:38] <kinesis> Hi, does .draggable() work with a table row (ex: #mydiv tr.t0 - where 't0' is <tr class="tr0">)
[17:16:08] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/4XyzJ/8/ <- theres a fiddle
[17:18:40] <dabear_> kinesis: you wanna re-arrange table rows?
[17:21:59] <kinesis> i want to do drag and drop like this:
[17:22:13] <kinesis> helper style
[17:22:21] <kinesis> http://www.elated.com/res/File/articles/development/javascript/jquery/drag-and-drop-with-jquery-your-essential-guide/draggable-helper.html
[17:22:33] <kinesis> but instead of doing it with a div, i want to do it on a table row
[17:24:07] <james13433> Anyone happen to have a link to some code that will let me do ajax request as the user types, I have some at the moment that works based on ID  = x, but I need it to be class based
[17:26:30] <Brodingo_> # -> .
[17:26:51] <dabear_> kinesis: maybe something like: http://jsfiddle.net/4XyzJ/15/
[17:28:16] <Brodingo_> james13433 basically you want to debounce an ajax call within a bound keypress event
[17:28:52] <james13433> hmm at I was using http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1620602/javascript-jquery-make-an-ajax-request-when-a-user-is-typing-in-a-textarea
[17:29:12] <james13433> But I think that needs to be an Id to use that code, maybe not?
[17:29:13] <Brodingo_> yeah, exactly
[17:30:07] <james13433> was yeah, exactly in response to But I think that needs to be an Id to use that code, maybe not? or the link above?
[17:30:33] <Brodingo_> to the link, sorry. and yeah thats just plain js code
[17:30:45] <kinesis> that breaks on chrome, dabear but nice try
[17:30:53] <kinesis> sorry i mean rokmelt, its not compatible with rockmelt
[17:31:10] <kinesis> there is a table drag and drop jquery from 2008.. seems like the best solution
[17:31:55] <kinesis> if not, that sucks. I really wanted to use this with my project
[17:31:56] <dabear_> kinesis: rockmeit?
[17:32:00] <dabear_> wtf is that:p
[17:32:02] <kinesis> Rockmelt
[17:32:22] <kinesis> its a new web browser, i like it better than chrome
[17:32:36] <dabear_> lolz
[17:32:40] <dabear_> works in chrome
[17:32:45] <dabear_> chrome<3
[17:32:51] <kinesis> idk if its new, but i lke it.. i just heard about it, and im in Mountain View (by Google et) and saw an autographed rockmelt tshirt in the window of one of the boutique shops
[17:33:27] <Brodingo_> james13433 very simple example http://jsfiddle.net/Fq6My/
[17:33:28] <systemfault> Looks like chrome + social crap.
[17:33:39] <kinesis> i just turn off the soial apps.. quiet mode
[17:34:04] <dabear_> kinesis: your a webdev
[17:34:27] <dabear_> if something brakes in some fancy smanchy unused browser and you care about it, fix it
[17:35:01] <otherj> "not a browser. a WOWser"
[17:35:03] <otherj> ouch.
[17:35:05] <otherj> not the best line.
[17:35:36] <james13433> Ok thanks for that Brodingo_
[17:35:57] <Teduardo> I've seen several websites using something called 'supermenu' it appears to be a common jquery thing but I can't find the actual source of the code.. anyone know where it comes from?
[17:37:23] <PhonicUK> anyone know of a set of plugins that wraps up thiings like checkboxes and radio buttons jquery-ui style?
[17:43:54] <james13433> lol failed then, I set an alert to show when its searching, but every time I clicked on to search it alerted again because of keyup…. whoops
[17:44:43] <PhonicUK> man this is tricky...
[17:45:04] <PhonicUK> I have a data structure that describes the appearance of a user interface built out of jquery-ui
[17:45:08] <PhonicUK> and I can built it and its fine

[17:46:01] <PhonicUK> AHA!
[17:48:36] <shoky> Teduardo like what site
[17:52:02] <james13433> Probably a nooby question, but I need to pass the current input field into the test function, how do I do that? http://jsfiddle.net/C7Mns/
[17:57:25] <james13433> anyone
[17:57:26] <james13433> ?
[17:58:03] <xec> james13433: your demo is missing markup
[17:58:30] <xec> james13433: so i don't understand the question
[17:58:50] <james13433> xec, see $("#test").val()}
[17:59:29] <james13433> that need to be instead of a set id whatever input triggered the actions val
[18:00:06] <xec> actions val?
[18:00:10] <xec> i'm not following
[18:01:00] <james13433> Well the top key press function, is triggered when a user types in any of a number of input fields, any with the class test
[18:01:57] <james13433> I then need to pass what ever value that ends up as though to the test function so I can do a ajax called based on what the user typed in the active input
[18:02:06] <xec> why don't you add some inputs to your demo so it's easier to understand, i'm trying to level my jedi here :D
[18:02:16] <james13433> sure thing
[18:02:26] <sovok> use setTimeout(function() {test(this);}, 500) and then work with this value in test(). generally: use a closure http://www.makemineatriple.com/2007/10/passing-parameters-to-a-function-called-with-settimeout
[18:04:42] <Teduardo> shoky: like softlayer.com
[18:04:46] <xec> what's the settimeout for btw? making sure you're not spamming the server with requests?
[18:05:53] <Atmazee> hello.  i am using a function to select certain elements of the DOM and apply a css style to it.  i cannot figure out how to make those styles be applied to new items that are added.  i have read a lot of stuff on event binding but am really struggling with the right solution.  here is my example:  http://jsfiddle.net/ZP9DH/1/    (click the target)
[18:06:43] <james13433> xec http://jsfiddle.net/C7Mns/1/
[18:07:09] <james13433> It will be a quick order form, so I need to do an inline search.
[18:07:54] <shaggy`> how would you make a 'drag down menu' like the pull down notification bar on android and iphone?
[18:10:26] <james13433> ahh didn't see you there sovok, will try.
[18:12:17] <Teduardo> shoky: I just liked the look of their menu and i wanted to see if that was a plugin or what
[18:14:12] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/C7Mns/3/
[18:14:53] <james13433> perfecto, thanks xec! :)
[18:40:12] <shoky> Teduardo: they're not using any plugin for that
[18:40:30] <shoky> Teduardo: their menu js code is here http://www.softlayer.com/jscript/commonBlackTheme.js
[18:40:49] <Teduardo> ah, i wont gank their custom js lol
[18:41:05] <shoky> it's pretty short and simple
[18:41:22] <shoky> just showing this div, hiding that div
[18:42:13] <shaggy`> jQuery mobile, to use or not to use?
[18:43:03] <xec> shaggy`: wrong place to ask if you want an unbiased anser, i expect ;)
[18:44:13] <Whirl3d> shaggy, what other options have you considered?
[18:44:30] <shaggy`> haha xec probably right :) how about this, if I were tyring to build a toolbar/header that you could pull down (like the pulldown notification bar in android and iOS), would I be better to do that with jquery mobile or to go from scratch?
[18:44:56] <shaggy`> Whirl3d, well atm, jquery mobile and doing it by css and html
[18:45:41] <Whirl3d> I would say, Yes, use jquery mobile then
[18:45:43] <xec> toolbar, as in an app?
[18:46:44] <shaggy`> A phonegap app
[18:47:49] <shoky> Atmazee: http://jsfiddle.net/ZP9DH/3/
[19:20:03] <Lyfesaver> i have a question for jqueryUI, i have the slider, is there any way to apply the slider plugin to style the scrollbar for a div's overflow?
[19:21:37] <StevenCodes> Lyfesaver,  Can you rephrase it at all ?
[19:21:48] <Lyfesaver> sure
[19:21:50] <Lyfesaver> I have a div
[19:22:04] <Lyfesaver> and it uses a scrollbar to control the content
[19:22:06] <Lyfesaver> horizontaly
[19:22:45] <Lyfesaver> the scrollbar is the ugly native scrollbar
[19:23:04] <Lyfesaver> was wondering if i can user the slider plugin from jQueryUI to replace it
[19:25:17] <xec> Lyfesaver: try googling for something like "jquery ui slider scrollbar" - i'm sure it's possible
[19:25:39] <Lyfesaver> ya tried searching the jQueryUI forum
[19:25:43] <Lyfesaver> will try google
[19:45:51] <Lyfesaver> jesus, going on 4 hours just to figure out how to apply the slider styling....
[19:46:21] <Lyfesaver> about to just do it with webkit, even tho a perfectly glood slider is already built and loaded
[19:46:31] <Lyfesaver> makes no sense
[20:13:09] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, there is a slidebar replacement plugin that you could manually style with jQueryUI control styles.
[20:13:23] <Lyfesaver> ?
[20:13:39] <Lyfesaver> kk
[20:14:05] <Whirl3d> http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller
[20:15:11] <Lyfesaver> ty will give it a try
[21:03:04] <Monkeypaws> haaaaalp i dont know what im doing
[21:19:36] <Monkeypaws> Could someone check this ajax request out?  login.php gets called but, as far as i can tell, display_queue.php never displays on the div #controls2.  https://gist.github.com/2532965
[21:32:07] <Monkeypaws> so apparently "return false;" is sort of important.
[21:38:46] <firebalrog> yes it kinda is
[21:39:12] <firebalrog> sorry feeling a bit sarcastic tonight.
[21:44:45] <Monkeypaws> :)
[21:44:53] <Monkeypaws> well its all working now, mr sarcastic
[21:45:09] <Monkeypaws> blunt force webcoding.
[21:45:11] <krazyj> hey folks… i have a draggable div inside of a parent with a lower z-index and i can't select and drag the draggable anymore. any ideas?
[21:45:44] <Monkeypaws> im a nub srry.
[21:46:31] <raj> I have a perplexing question that requires Cork-like expertise
[21:46:47] <raj> any daring patrons?
[21:47:13] <gf3> krazyj: Change the z-index :)
[21:47:22] <krazyj> gf3: then that breaks my layering :(
[21:47:39] <gf3> Sounds like your layering is already broken :)
[21:52:32] <krazyj> gf3: blah. what am i missing here? here's my div breakdown: http://screencast.com/t/pxHLbrWhcB
[21:52:47] <krazyj> basically, the gray div is z-index: -1 to layer underneath the iphone
[21:52:58] <krazyj> and i'm trying to set Location/Menu divs as draggable
[21:55:40] <gf3> krazyj: -1 can get weird at times, why don't you simply set the iPhone to a much higher z-index?
[21:55:49] <gf3> And the grey thing to a lower one
[21:56:13] <krazyj> ah ok
[21:56:16] <krazyj> is -1 a special case?
[21:57:24] <krazyj> gf3: for some reason, setting the iPhone div to z-index 1000 and removing the z-index for the gray div results in the gray div overlaying the iPhone
[21:57:34] <gf3> krazyj: Not special case, but it has special meaning
[21:57:40] <krazyj> oh?
[21:57:46] <gf3> krazyj: Remember to use z-index, elements must be positioned
[21:57:57] <gf3> krazyj: So you might need position: relative; on them both
[21:58:25] <krazyj> gf3: boom. forgot that position on the iPhone
[21:58:26] <krazyj> thanks :)
[21:58:29] <krazyj> what's the special meaning of -1
[21:58:42] <krazyj> is that build into the w3c spec for CSS or just convention/
[22:00:17] <gf3> krazyj: Negative z-indicies were added in CSS 2.1 I believe
[22:00:43] <krazyj> ah
[22:00:48] <gf3> The semantics are slightly different, but generally I've had issues with them
[22:01:06] <krazyj> any overall tips for getting a div to expand to the remaining space in the parent div?
[22:02:05] <gf3> krazyj: width/height 100%?
[22:02:32] <krazyj> yeah, didn't work
[22:03:01] <gf3> box-sizing: border-box; is your friend
[22:03:44] <krazyj> gf3: do you read SASS? here's my architecture: https://gist.github.com/e7013434650d7e6dd859
[22:04:04] <krazyj> i want #submit-container to expand to the extra space at the bottom of #right-side-container, under #module-list
[22:05:26] <gf3> krazyj: Also this → http://jsfiddle.net/5FnJX/
[22:06:09] <gf3> krazyj: That looks like HAML not SASS :)
[22:06:14] <krazyj> d
[22:06:16] <krazyj> d'oh
[22:06:16] <krazyj> yeah
[22:06:22] <Monkeypaws> omg firebug is awesome.
[22:06:24] <Monkeypaws> i had no idea
[22:06:33] <gf3> Monkeypaws: Firebug is the worst
[22:06:37] <Monkeypaws> oh.
[22:06:47] <gf3> NICE TRY THOUGH, MOZILLA!

I absolutely cannot figure out why--> ...
[22:06:51] <Monkeypaws> but i can see my code running :D
[22:06:56] <raj> ... http://68.46.138.78:8080/testsingleupload I'd super appreciate help on this
[22:07:13] <krazyj> gf3: any thoughts on what i need to set for that div setup to work
[22:07:14] <gf3> krazyj: re: Markup, LGTM
[22:07:47] <krazyj> gf3: do i need to wrap the form fields in a div?
[22:11:05] <gf3> krazyj: http://jsfiddle.net/5FnJX/1/
[22:11:12] <gf3> Etc…
[22:14:43] <krazyj> gf3: what's that?
[22:15:07] <gf3> krazyj: I thought that's what you were asking?
[22:15:19] <gf3> krazyj: The iPhone above, and the other thing behind it
[22:15:43] <krazyj> ah i figured tha tout
[22:16:10] <krazyj> gf3: my problem now is getting submit-container to expand horizontally and vertically to the remaining space in parent div right-side-container
[22:16:16] <krazyj> so i can center that submit button horiz/vert
[22:16:29] <gf3> ahh
[22:16:32] <gf3> 'sec
[22:16:34] <gf3> er
[22:16:36] <gf3> sec'
[22:17:38] <gf3> krazyj: So you want that submit thing to cover everything else inside #right-side-container?
[22:18:04] <krazyj> no, just expand to the available space under #module-list
[22:21:47] <gf3> krazyj: Oh well that's pretty straight-forward, it's the only thing after #module-list
[22:22:11] <krazyj> gf3: sure. but no matter what i set for it, it doesn't want to autoexpand
[22:22:18] <krazyj> here's my SCSS for this
[22:22:23] <gf3> krazyj: I don't follow
[22:22:35] <krazyj> gf3: https://gist.github.com/3448dc0673884b03ab5e
[22:23:11] <gf3> krazyj: Can you make a JSFiddle?
[22:23:46] <krazyj> gf3: http://screencast.com/t/7xU4Ln0R
[22:23:48] <krazyj> ok let me give it a shot
[22:25:18] <krazyj> gf3: http://jsfiddle.net/UQ9NQ/
[22:26:00] <krazyj> so, i want to get #submit-container to auto expand to the space in the parent div - #right-side-container - in the area underneath #module-list
[22:27:27] <gf3> krazyj: There is no extra space to "auto-expand" into
[22:27:34] <krazyj> oh?
[22:28:27] <gf3> krazyj: My Web Inspector shows that #right-side-container ends at the bottom of #submit-container
[22:28:42] <krazyj> ah yes
[22:30:56] <krazyj> gf3: if i hard code a height into #right-side-container, the submit div gets huge
[22:31:38] <krazyj> if i do width/height: 100% on #submit-container, it actually turns into the height of #right-side-container
[22:32:02] <krazyj> so #right-side-container is 758px height, #submit-container is 758px height
[22:32:55] <gf3> Does the height of #module-list ever change?
[22:34:24] <krazyj> it may, if i add more `.module-block`s
[22:34:33] <krazyj> but i could make it fixed height
[22:40:56] <krazyj> gf3: don't leave me :D
[22:41:36] <gf3> Heh
[22:41:47] <gf3> I say, fuck it, let it hang
[22:42:00] <krazyj> well, i'm trying to vert center the submit button
[22:42:08] <krazyj> between the bottom of #module-list and the bottom of the parent div
[22:42:22] <gf3> Either keep it at the bottom with a fixed height, or give it a fixed height and let the modules push it up and down
[22:43:31] <krazyj> gf3: so making it auto expand to that space is hard, huh?
[22:43:45] <gf3> krazyj: You could use flexbox model, but support isn't the best
[22:44:07] <krazyj> cross browser is inconsequential, this is for a proof of concept demo
[22:44:29] <gf3> krazyj: Well then go nuts, use the flexible box model
[22:44:35] <gf3> http://caniuse.com/#search=flexible
[22:56:59] <raj> gf3, mind taking a look at my code?
[22:57:12] <gf3> raj: Do you have a JSFiddle?
[22:57:24] <raj> even better, I've got it live
[22:58:15] <raj> When uploading files with Chrome, serverside I get MultiDict([(u'files[]', FieldStorage(u'files[]', u"raj's 26th bday 006.JPG")), (u'files[]', FieldStorage(u'files[]', u"raj's 26th bday 012.JPG"))]) ... but when using IE, I get MultiDict([(u'files[],files[]', FieldStorage(u'files[],files[]', u"raj's 26th bday 006.JPG")), (u'files[],files[]', FieldStorage(u'files[],files[]', u"raj's 26th bday 012.JPG"))]). Here's the live code--> ...
[22:58:21] <raj> ... http://68.46.138.78:8080/testsingleupload
[22:58:32] <gf3> Even even better would be a reduced test case :)
[22:58:43] <raj> it's reduced
[22:58:57] <raj> just has the necessities in testsingleupload.js
[22:59:17] <gf3> There are like 400-million dependencies in there
[22:59:35] <gf3> And a ton of irrelevant HTML
[22:59:39] <raj> it's just cuz of the header
[22:59:48] <raj> my question is in the js file though
[23:00:03] <raj> testsingleupload.js
[23:00:05] <krazyj> for a draggable, what's the best practice in changing the z-index and reverting it, once the drag is dropped?
[23:00:36] <raj> krazyj, probably using a class is a good idea
[23:00:36] <gf3> krazyj: you can use $.fn.data
[23:01:07] <krazyj> gf3: noob alert: what's $.fn.data?
[23:01:30] <gf3> krazyj: Well raj's idea might even be better, just add a CSS class such as .dragging
[23:01:44] <gf3> Then remove it when dropped :)
[23:02:03] <krazyj> but wouldn't that need to inherit all of the parent class's properties?
[23:02:04] <gf3> I jQUI adds a bunch of classes that you can piggyback off of
[23:02:17] <krazyj> if i replace the objects class
[23:02:23] <raj> you don't have to replace it
[23:02:32] <gf3> krazyj: You don't have to replace it, you can have multiple classes
[23:02:34] <raj> just add an additional class with your desired z-index
[23:02:37] <krazyj> ah
[23:02:56] <raj> <div class="class1 andclass2"></div>
[23:03:38] <raj> and with jquery, just $('.class1.class2').addClass('dragging')
[23:03:56] <raj> and then .removeClass('dragging')
[23:04:16] <raj> oops--> $('.class1.andclass2').addClass('dragging')
[23:04:41] <raj> gf3, IE uses iframe-transport
[23:04:47] <raj> since it doesn't have xhr
[23:06:50] <gf3> WAT
[23:07:09] <raj> not sure if that has to do with the issue
[23:07:17] <systemfault> IE invented XHR :)
[23:07:22] <systemfault> (MS)
[23:07:35] <raj> then why doesn't xhr work with IE?
[23:07:54] <systemfault> raj: You cannot send files with XHR on IE :)
[23:08:11] <raj> right
[23:09:37] <raj> k, so any idea gf3?
[23:10:04] <gf3> ?minimal @ raj
[23:10:05] <bot-t> raj, A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less. If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[23:11:52] <Dr-Bombay> 32 huh
[23:12:58] <systemfault> Dr-Bombay: Yeah! Not 33!
[23:13:19] <systemfault> Even if the 33th line is a blank one, it's too much.
[23:14:23] <gf3> And I will refuse to look at it.
[23:20:52] <tbharath> can anyone give some resources on how to use jquery plugins?
[23:21:07] <raj> gf3, knock yourself out
[23:21:12] <raj> it's minimal
[23:34:27] <raj> systemfault, could you perhaps take a look at my code and tell me what's wrong?
[23:34:55] <Whirl3d> how do you filter not a class using filter?   var bgImages=$(".bgImage"). bgImages.filter(":not('.blur')").show()   ?
[23:35:15] <raj> .not('.blur')
[23:35:41] <Whirl3d> I have to use filter. I'm passing a paramter to the filter method.
[23:36:35] <raj> not sure you can
[23:37:04] <raj> if what you had didn't work
[23:38:06] <raj> you can try .filter($(':not('.blur')'))
[23:38:21] <gf3> :(
[23:38:26] <raj> oh, sorry
[23:38:32] <raj> Whirl3d, take the quotes around blur out
[23:40:44] <gf3> Whirl3d: .filter(function(){ return this.className.indexOf('blur') > -1 })
[23:41:59] <raj> mine should work without the function
[23:42:21] <gf3> Yeah, but yours sucks
[23:42:32] <raj> actually it's exactly what he was asking for
[23:42:59] <gf3> And it's horribly inefficient
[23:43:13] <raj> well, I answered his question
