[05:38:53] <ozette> anyone ever had an explanation for https://paste.debian.net/hidden/f1fdad66/ ?
[05:39:10] <ozette> the e.total variable changing from eg. 20MB to 10.65KB when done
[06:01:19] <Cork> ozette: that question has to go to the browser developer, cause it is not jquery generating that value
[06:02:56] <Cork> ozette: also you might want to check e.lengthComputable
[06:03:33] <Cork> ah, sorry you already do
[06:13:12] <ozette> the progress event is not a jquery thing?
[06:13:52] <Cork> ozette: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/progress
[06:14:18] <Cork> jquery just forwards it from the xhr object
[06:14:40] <ozette> let me see if i have this issue outside of chrome..
[06:23:56] <ozette> Cork: same result in firefox
[07:59:49] <lolii> is it better to make <a href="#" onlick="function(t1)">t1</a>  or get url parameter value after document.ready()  lets say index.php?t=t1 with a selfmade function like so https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19491336/get-url-parameter-jquery-or-how-to-get-query-string-values-in-js
[08:00:26] <lolii> function(t1) also call document ready
[08:02:09] <Cork> lolii: 1. don't use a tags for actions (use <button type="button"> and style it to look the way you want)
[08:02:18] <Cork> 2. don't use event attributes use event litener
[08:02:54] <Cork> and 3. store the value in a data-action="t1"
[08:21:21] <Ninjacoder_> hi
[08:22:12] <Ninjacoder_> the best option for add a table with jquery is $(#table).append('<table>'); here the other <tr><td> ... ?
[08:22:38] <thykka> best option is to not generate elements dynamically, but to include them with the html :P
[08:24:28] <Ninjacoder_> thykka how exatly ? the problem is i showing something from an output with a loop and the html is hidden before that
[08:24:34] <Ninjacoder_> take a look https://jsfiddle.net/_ninjacoder_/bk8957ka/12/
[08:25:16] <Cork> Ninjacoder_: append doesn't work like that
[08:25:32] <Cork> also you should not append to an attached element in a loop
[08:25:39] <Cork> it kills browser performance
[08:25:45] <thykka> and don't use <br> like that. Instead, use block level elements
[08:27:09] <Cork> Ninjacoder_: also <div> is not valid inside thead
[08:28:40] <thykka> Also, it's not tabular data, so a table should not be used in the first place
[08:29:26] <Ninjacoder_> thykka explain me the block level issue, coz never used before
[08:29:44] <thykka> Ninjacoder_, <br> is mean't for line breaks, not layouting
[08:29:59] <thykka> if you're using it for anything else, you're doing it wrong
[08:30:04] <Ninjacoder_> okey, the best option for a line break with jquery ?
[08:30:18] <thykka> put your content in div's
[08:30:20] <Ninjacoder_> nope, just need a break after the calling
[08:30:32] <AdamPDotty> then take one
[08:30:45] <thykka> xD
[08:30:55] <Ninjacoder_> hm the content is in div's
[08:31:23] <Ninjacoder_> ok i fix
[08:32:17] <AdamPDotty> First step: https://validator.w3.org
[08:32:28] <Cork> Ninjacoder_: my recommendations: https://jsfiddle.net/bk8957ka/13/
[08:33:29] <Cork> for the original question that is :)
[08:34:31] <Ninjacoder_> Cork thats run for you?
[08:35:07] <AdamPDotty> The <div> align attribute is not supported in HTML5. Use CSS instead.
[08:35:09] <Cork> some wrong placed parantecis https://jsfiddle.net/bk8957ka/14/
[08:36:47] <Ninjacoder_> Cork still no
[08:37:11] <Cork> Ninjacoder_: i didn't fix your selectors, so the calling of loadDoc i haven't touched
[08:37:19] <Cork> but the point is the table templating
[08:37:38] <Ninjacoder_> correct
[08:37:55] <Ninjacoder_> need something more easy. but thx
[08:38:26] * AdamPDotty will some day try that.
[08:38:41] <thykka> try what? easy?
[08:39:45] <AdamPDotty> template script
[08:40:54] <Ninjacoder_> no lol, just genertate a table with jquery with a loop
[08:40:56] <preference> why is div being discontinued?
[08:40:59] <Cork> AdamPDotty: it is what was the source for <template> that you can use in modern browsers
[08:40:59] <Ninjacoder_> generate*
[08:41:09] <Cork> preference: div isn't discontinued
[08:41:17] <Cork> preference: align="" was
[08:41:32] <preference> oh ok
[08:41:37] <preference> that terrified me briefly :)
[08:41:43] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[08:41:44] <Cork> was but that was back in html 4 adys
[08:41:52] <Cork> *days
[08:41:54] * AdamPDotty born to consufe
[08:42:17] <Cork> it went at the same time as <font> tags
[08:42:54] <AdamPDotty> I did not use <font> in 3.2 unless to combat browser bugs.
[08:43:17] <Cork> uh, are you sure? 3.2 is mid to late 90's :)
[08:43:28] <Cork> css barely existed back then
[08:44:32] <AdamPDotty> I started out with the philosophy that presentation is taken care of on user side.
[08:44:52] <Cork> html 2 1995, html 3.2 1997, html 4.01 1999
[08:45:09] <AdamPDotty> I did not like site to force a font on me while not even knowing whether it is available.
[08:45:37] <AdamPDotty> And they had such awful stuff.
[08:45:49] <Cork> ya, html 2 and 3 was really horrible
[08:45:58] <Cork> and js at the time wasn't better
[10:41:42] <catbadger> what up homies?
[10:42:30] <KnightsOfNi> How do you include some jquery code in the middle of your html when your jquery library is only included at the end of the hmtl?
[10:42:43] <KnightsOfNi> When I do this now it says $ is not defined
[10:42:52] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: you don't
[10:42:59] <catbadger> put your code inside $(document).ready(function(){})
[10:43:03] <Cork> no
[10:43:14] <KnightsOfNi> catbadger, :|
[10:43:16] <Cork> you can't use any jquery features before jquery is loaded
[10:43:35] <catbadger> KnightsOfNi :| then don't listen...
[10:43:45] <KnightsOfNi> catbadger, your info is wrong
[10:43:48] <catbadger> ok
[10:43:51] <Cork> catbadger: .ready is a jquery feature you can't use it before jqeury is loaded
[10:43:56] <catbadger> i'll just take my 20 years of experience and block you
[10:44:00] <Cork> ...
[10:44:14] <KnightsOfNi> 20 years of experience and you don't know this, wow
[10:44:17] <Cork> catbadger: read the question before answering...
[10:44:23] <catbadger> loading scripts at the bottom of an html file makes them available to any script tags
[10:44:29] <Cork> no
[10:44:37] <catbadger> okie...
[10:44:40] <Cork> that isn't even close to correct...
[10:44:41] <KnightsOfNi> how can it use $ function if it has not been defined yet?!
[10:44:44] <catbadger> omg
[10:45:07] <Cork> catbadger: html is parsed from to top to the bottom, scripts doesn't exist before the html has parsed the script tag...
[10:45:44] <Cork> script blocks the following html parsing until it has been parsed, THAT is why ppl often put the script tag at the end of the file
[10:45:55] <KnightsOfNi> he's gone...
[10:45:56] <Cork> with the catch that you only have scripts at the end
[10:46:16] <Cork> ah, i missed that he just joined...
[10:47:08] <Cork> anyway, if you put the jquery inclution tag at the end it means all scripts depending on it has to be at the end (after it)
[10:47:26] <Cork> there is no way around that
[10:56:26] <taplar> technically you could put your script in a window.load event handler, no?
[10:57:09] <Cork> taplar: not fully sure if load fires before or after scripts loaded at the very bottom of the body
[10:57:26] <Cork> i know theres been bugs where it doesn't
[10:57:40] <Cork> but all browsers today might do it right, donno
[12:11:45] <lolii> Cork So using click() on links it's not good ?
[12:13:11] <lolii> I have a page A that include footer.  In footer I've added some link click event to load a C.php file into a div. But once I click on a link in A it redirect me to B without loading  C.php
[12:14:04] <lolii> the url on B change as I want with  a:link.text()
[12:15:02] <thinkxl> you need to bind an event listener and use event.prefentDefault();
[12:15:08] <thinkxl> if i understood correctly
[12:15:34] <thinkxl> $('.link').on('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[12:17:26] <taplar> my first question would be if you are wanting the link to not go to B, why do you have it pointing there?
[12:19:21] <lolii> I have A.php with footer.php included.   all A links have a class. When I click on a link (which redirects to B.php) in A.php I want first to go to B.php then load  C.php
[12:19:54] <taplar> wait, you want it to transfer to B, and then load C?
[12:20:16] <lolii> taplar load a php file in div contained in B.php
[12:20:36] <taplar> right, and should this always happen on B?
[12:20:56] <lolii> taplar yes
[12:21:07] <taplar> so why are you doing anything with a click handler?
[12:21:14] <taplar> you just need to make B load C into whatever div
[12:21:40] <lolii> I have  Home.php include header.php and footer.php , Home.php and header.php  links redirect to List.php
[12:23:05] <taplar> are you trying to make a single page application?
[12:23:15] <lolii> taplar no
[12:23:30] <thinkxl> damn, that'd be an interesting twist of the story
[12:23:37] <taplar> i'm very confused
[12:24:03] <lolii> ok Ill test it
[12:29:57] <nitrospectide> I am using .attr() to add a data attribute to a DOM element, and then in my next line of code, I am looking for all items with that data attribute and performing an action on them. I see the attribute being applied in my source inspector, but the action is not being performed. Is this an order of execution issue, where the second bit is running before the first one completes?
[12:30:41] <taplar> how are you looking for the elements?
[12:34:55] <nitrospectide> 1 sec… I may have found an issue
[12:36:32] <taplar> thing you never want to hear from a doctor
[12:38:11] <nitrospectide> LOL
[13:01:02] <JuJUBee> Can someone suggest a simple but good form validation library?
[13:01:35] <taplar> there's a jquery validate plugin
[13:01:53] <taplar> https://jqueryvalidation.org/
[13:02:54] <JuJUBee> I looked at it, not a huge fan
[13:07:49] <nitrospectide> taplar: Sorry. I got a call.
[13:08:29] <taplar> np
[13:11:17] <nitrospectide> I've got it working, but now am questioning my whole approach, since I don't think I WANT to do Google Analytics tracking on the submit click, since anyone being hit with validation errors will click the submit more than once. Hmmm. Any way to only capture a submission that goes through, without having to place it on the Thank You? I'm not sure how I can hook into only a successful form submission action via jQuery.
[13:12:12] <taplar> does the existence of validation errors cancel the submit?
[13:12:23] <nitrospectide> yeah, it does
[13:12:40] <taplar> so yeah, you could do the ga call on a successful submit
[13:12:59] <nitrospectide> How do I hook into that via jQuery?
[13:13:35] <nitrospectide> right now, it's just .click() on the submit button
[13:13:41] <taplar> You could try binding a submit handler to the form, and if it is bound after the validation, I would think it would not happen if the event was cancelled
[13:16:03] <taplar> also what validation library are you using?
[13:16:33] <nitrospectide> so maybe validation is using a preventDefault(), and submit() would let us attach the handler AFTER that
[13:16:56] <taplar> yeah, that's what my first suggestion was referring to
[13:17:27] <taplar> if the binding of the validation happens first, then that should happen before any binding for other submit events should happen
[13:17:44] <taplar> so if the validation cancels it, the second *should not* happen
[13:19:22] <nitrospectide> I'm not sure what's being used for validation. The form is built with the Drupal 7 webform module.
[13:27:03] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[13:27:49] <taplar> it's funny.  we have blue skies with white clouds, and off to the side dark gray ones, and it just started thundering
[13:28:23] <robertmaxrees> hah, that happened yesterday here.
[13:28:36] <robertmaxrees> and then it's started raining like crazy
[13:29:25] <taplar> i'm waiting for it, though not much is showing on the doppler
[13:29:41] <taplar> but it's that kinda hot outside were you are just like.... yeah, it's coming
[13:30:29] <nitrospectide> taplar: Where are you? We *just* had storms roll in like 5-10 min ago.
[13:30:40] <taplar> little rock
[13:30:48] <nitrospectide> Dalls, here
[13:30:54] <nitrospectide> Dallas
[13:31:48] <taplar> yeah, you guys are right below a big red area
[13:33:13] <nitrospectide> So, it looks like .submit() is blocked by preventDefault(), but then it never fires when the form is finally submitted. Maybe the preventDefault on validation just kills it, and then never reinstates…? Not sure what to attach to, then.
[13:33:49] <taplar> how are you binding the submit?
[13:34:39] <nitrospectide> jQuery('form#webform-client-form-5 input.webform-submit').submit(function()
[13:34:53] <taplar> try doing it as a native binding and see if anything changes
[13:35:08] <taplar> oh wait
[13:35:21] <taplar> no, you are binding a submit handler on the input field
[13:35:25] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[13:35:26] <taplar> the submit event happens on the form
[13:35:55] <taplar> jQuery('#webform-client-form-5')
[13:36:25] <nitrospectide> ah
[13:36:28] <nitrospectide> hmmm
[13:37:10] <nitrospectide> BOOM!
[13:37:18] <nitrospectide> It works
[13:37:22] <taplar> sweet
[13:37:48] <nitrospectide> Man, without that last tidbit, I would have spun my wheels. Thank you!
[13:37:55] <taplar> np man
[13:37:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:38:01] <robertmaxrees> taplar++++
[13:38:03] <taplar> lady
[13:38:04] <taplar> person
[13:38:42] <nitrospectide> "man" is right… no worries :)
[13:39:13] <Woet> "man" works in 90% of cases on IRC
[13:39:28] <nitrospectide> esp in a programming chan?
[13:39:40] <taplar> yeah, but sometimes I just have to try to be pc
[13:39:42] <Woet> more like 99% in that case
[13:40:48] <nitrospectide> taplar: No need to be PC with me. Doesn't bother me. :)
[13:42:43] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: So where are you? East coast?
[13:43:03] <nitrospectide> You said you had the funky waether yesterday
[13:44:04] <taplar> he lives in the second circle of hell
[13:44:11] <robertmaxrees> ^ basically.
[13:44:32] <nitrospectide> But it's a dry heat
[13:44:38] <robertmaxrees> but forreal, Northern California.  Town called Chico.
[13:45:05] <nitrospectide> Oh, nice. It's supposed to be very scenic in NoCal.
[13:46:07] <taplar> it's very splenda'ed
[13:46:08] <robertmaxrees> it is.  we've got one of the largest municipal parks in the country.
[13:46:35] <robertmaxrees> plus we're super close to sea level, but you can drive 15-20 minutes in the winter and get to the snow.
[13:47:07] <nitrospectide> best of both worlds
[13:47:13] <robertmaxrees> basically :)
[13:47:23] <robertmaxrees> oh and we have sierra nevada.
[13:50:50] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaaaaaaa i need to wake up.
[14:16:23] <lolii> taplar I want to add click event on link  to get the link text() then when the B.php load some data with sql in C.php and finally put the result inside a div on page B.php
[14:16:53] <Woet> lolii: go ahead
[14:17:04] <taplar> the A/B/C thing is confusing
[14:17:15] <taplar> You said you have a home page, that loads a header and footer
[14:17:26] <taplar> and that clicking links goes to links.php or something
[14:19:02] <taplar> so i'm a user on your home page, and i see the header and footer and whatever content the home page has
[14:19:12] <taplar> what action do I as a user do, that you are trying to figure out?
[14:19:51] <lolii> taplar I have Home.php include footer.php and header.php,  links from home.php header.php redirect to links.php. But I have another php file say sql.php that get data from database according to links.text() from home or header
[14:20:43] <taplar> So i'm on the home page, and i click a link.  and that navigates to links.php in the browser?
[14:20:51] <lolii> taplar yes
[14:20:56] <taplar> ok
[14:21:21] <taplar> so now links, i'm assuming, is going to load the header and the footer, and whatever content should be in the middle depending on which link was clicked
[14:21:51] <lolii> taplar Yes
[14:22:07] <taplar> alright.  so having established that, what's your question?
[14:22:21] <lolii> taplar this is why I'm getting the link.text()  then   sql.php will look into the database
[14:22:34] <taplar> you don't need links text
[14:22:46] <thinkxl> we still with the link .php question
[14:22:47] <taplar> you can put a ?link=something on the url for your php to grab
[14:22:51] <lolii> taplar or I have to get the url  GET parameter ? but is it safe ?
[14:22:55] <taplar> to know which content to show
[14:23:01] <taplar> sure
[14:23:11] <noahsiano> by safe, what do you mean?
[14:23:14] <taplar> using the $_GET to tell which resource to show is safe, so long as you map it
[14:23:37] <lolii> noahsiano in general no idea
[14:23:53] <taplar> you don't want to directly reference a resource on your server with a parameter, but mapping them is fine
[14:24:53] <taplar> i'm sure there is an owasp article on this.  i just have to find it
[14:26:02] <taplar> here's the short version though
[14:26:09] <lolii> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/7wgkkot2/1/
[14:26:23] <taplar> this isn't a jquery thing
[14:26:28] <taplar> it's not even a javascript thing
[14:26:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:26:51] <taplar> <a href="/links.php?link=thing">Go to Thing</a>
[14:27:13] <taplar> but here's the short(ish) security warning
[14:27:35] <taplar> there are cases where developers have made urls like "endpoint.php?file=myfile.txt"
[14:27:48] <taplar> and just grab that off the url, read it, and return it to the user
[14:28:14] <taplar> but that is a security vulnerability, because you are allowing the user effectively access to any resource on your box that the webserver has access to
[14:28:30] <taplar> what you -want- to do, is map those resources
[14:28:46] <taplar> "endpoint.php?file=newplan"
[14:28:57] <taplar> "newplan" doesn't exist on the machine
[14:29:19] <taplar> but your logic has a map that says, hey, if they give me "newplan", return to them /public/files/newplan.txt"
[14:29:28] <taplar> or something
[14:29:46] <taplar> at which point you control entirely what they have access to, and obscure where it comes from
[14:30:04] <taplar> if they give you a map key you don't have defined, return to them a 404
[14:30:12] <lolii> taplar yes
[14:30:38] <lolii> taplar so https://jsfiddle.net/7wgkkot2/1/ is wrong ?
[14:30:57] <taplar> again, giving your setup, this is not a javascript thing
[14:31:06] <taplar> it's just links with the parameter set on them
[14:31:07] <lolii> why
[14:31:30] <taplar> you said when you click on the link, you are transfering to another page and want to show the content with the header and footer
[14:31:41] <taplar> nothing about that says you must use javascript
[14:31:49] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:31:53] <robertmaxrees> in fact, i wouldn't use js in this case.
[14:32:47] <robertmaxrees> putting this in another perspective - is typet the name of the table you want to fetch?
[14:33:07] <lolii> taplar I want links.php to show me from the database based on the links he clicked in home.php to get there
[14:33:31] <lolii> robertmaxrees yes
[14:34:04] <robertmaxrees> lolii okay, so I openm up my network tab, see you have a file called getSQLData.php and you're passing it something that looks like a table name.
[14:34:36] <robertmaxrees> great way to let people dump your DB tables.  and with a minimal amount of effort, you could probably pwn that DB even more.
[14:34:36] <lolii> robertmaxrees yes
[14:34:58] <taplar> heh, that's not a good thing
[14:35:04] <lolii> how ?
[14:35:16] <taplar> "and with a minimal amount of effort, you could probably pwn that DB even more. "
[14:35:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm gonna guess that your backend is taking that typet and then using that as part of a sql query, right?
[14:35:42] <robertmaxrees> just interpolating it into a string that you pass on as a query
[14:36:02] <robertmaxrees> right?
[14:36:37] <lolii> robertmaxrees yes
[14:36:59] <robertmaxrees> so.  if it's just interpolating it into a string, what's to stop me from feeding it malicious SQL?
[14:37:35] <lolii> I just want to make a dynamic page : links.php,  What links the user clicked in home.php will redirect him in links.php and show the data from database based on the name links click in home.php
[14:38:08] <taplar> we understand
[14:38:22] <lolii> There are also links in  links.php If i click on them the div tu be loaded is dynamic without refreshing the page
[14:38:26] <lolii> so Hw should I do it
[14:38:45] <lolii> I know it's possible to do SQL injection but I haven't touched this area
[14:38:56] <robertmaxrees> the mapping idea that taplar gave you.
[14:39:15] <lolii> never heard about mapping data
[14:39:25] <taplar> well the links inside the links php sounds like a different scenario than the first
[14:39:25] <robertmaxrees> *commands
[14:39:36] <robertmaxrees> the long and short of it is at no point should your code ever interpolate user input with a SQL statement
[14:39:39] <noahsiano> just do the html taplar suggested, <a href="/links.php?link=thing">Go to Thing</a>, and then in your links.php file add some code to handle the $_GET["link"] parameter and have it populate if it's a link it knows
[14:41:20] <lolii> taplar links in links.php are same class as links in home.php or header.php in my jsfiddle : .productType
[14:41:44] <taplar> but they are in a different context
[14:41:58] <lolii> taplar context ?
[14:42:31] <taplar> context, just like speaking.  it's a relation to a given situation
[14:42:58] <taplar> those links in the links part have different parents to those of the footer
[14:43:34] <lolii> noahsiano echo $_GET["link"] ?
[14:43:44] <taplar> if you want to think of it as boxes, your header is a box at the top of the page, your footer is another box at the bottom of the page, and your content is the box in the middle
[14:43:49] <taplar> that middle "box" is your context
[14:44:23] <lolii> taplar ok
[14:45:27] <taplar> given that, you can apply javascript logic just against elements that exist inside that "box"
[14:47:42] <taplar> but before you get to that, I would suggest working out getting the links.php working
[14:50:01] <lolii> So  I have just to send the user <a href="links.php?link=product" class="thumbnail">Product 1</a>  and In the js part send to getSQLDATA.php the parameter value  with echo $_GET["link"] ?
[14:51:16] <taplar> using a prepared statement in some fashion, yes
[14:52:40] <lolii> taplar prevent sql injection is done in the client side using get parameter value and in the server side with isset or if the value receveid isn't in the table redirect to 404 ?
[14:53:39] <taplar> nooooooo
[14:53:42] <taplar> no no no
[14:53:57] <taplar> client NEVER prevents sql injection
[14:54:02] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[14:54:37] <lolii> yes
[14:54:51] <taplar> using the resource map to restrict what they can pass in, restricts what they can access.  but you should always use a prepared statement for your queries
[14:55:00] <noahsiano> agreed
[14:55:01] <lolii> II hesitated to say it
[14:55:18] <robertmaxrees> basically, NEVER interpolate user input into a SQL query.
[14:55:29] <robertmaxrees> at least in cases like this.
[14:55:31] <lolii> robertmaxrees interpolate ?
[14:55:43] <robertmaxrees> 'foo: ' + someVar + ' bar';
[14:56:10] <lolii> ????
[14:56:26] <lolii> oh it's sql injection ?
[14:57:05] <robertmaxrees> string interpolation is an easy way to allow sql injection
[14:57:24] <taplar> and is very easily prevented
[14:58:15] <taplar> https://secure.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.prepared-statements.php
[14:59:41] <lolii> taplar so mapping a ressource it's if the given get parameter value isn't  in the database redirect them to 404 else throw the data ?
[15:00:42] <Uhkis> what's this? #phpquery?
[15:00:46] <taplar> so what is the parameter you are providing?
[15:01:09] <taplar> the thing you gave earlier was "product"
[15:01:20] <taplar> are you giving like a sku/upc/etc ?
[15:01:26] <lolii> taplar let's say product and product isn't in the database
[15:01:44] <lolii> no product is in the database
[15:02:00] <taplar> then you're script would not find any results, and then links.php would have to know how to handle that
[15:02:18] <lolii> but if the user try to inject sql code in the get parameter value , only the server will prevent sql injection right ?
[15:02:33] <taplar> yes
[15:02:54] <taplar> your server is your gateway to your database
[15:03:00] <lolii> ok
[15:14:59] <lolii> taplar let's name links.php to  product.php,   what about the links in product.php (the page we want to load product from database). I don't want to reload the page when clicking on those links in product.php but only the div with data based on the link the user clicked in product.php. Thus, if there is no GET parameter value when clicking on them, I have to get the link text to dataSELECT.php ? Back to my first code when using click 
[15:15:39] <taplar> then those links would not hit product.php
[15:16:13] <taplar> those links would need to do ajax to another endpoint that performs just the logic for retrieving whatever should be retrieved for the area you want to update
[15:17:49] <lolii> taplar enpoint ? you mean another file.php to include inside product.php ?
[15:22:33] <taplar> sorry, i'm having to step a way a bit to deal with a prod issue
[15:41:08] <taplar> bakka bakka bakka
[15:41:13] <taplar> hmm, he left
[15:43:50] <robertmaxrees> oontz oontz oontz
[15:44:39] <taplar> you get monday off rob?
[15:44:58] <robertmaxrees> nah.  didn't take it off at least.
[15:45:27] <robertmaxrees> you?
[15:45:58] <taplar> nah, but i took it since i had some on call time off a crewed
[15:46:08] <noahsiano> so do you guys work for jquery?
[15:46:18] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[15:46:19] <taplar> nah, just nerds
[15:46:27] <robertmaxrees> tho nobody technically works "for jquery"
[15:46:48] <noahsiano> well, it's a foundation, i would assume there is a team that keeps it updated?
[15:47:11] <robertmaxrees> not any more :)
[15:47:13] <robertmaxrees> js foundation
[15:47:24] <noahsiano> ohh
[15:47:46] <noahsiano> so i guess you guys are just software devs at your respective companies?
[15:48:09] <robertmaxrees> tech lead and sr. software engineer here.
[15:48:17] <taplar> grunt dev here
[15:48:22] <taplar> not the language
[15:48:25] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:48:58] <noahsiano> cool cool. i'm an intern, working web dev and UX work this summer. graduating next May
[15:49:18] <taplar> nice
[15:49:32] <taplar> what stacks are you working with?
[15:50:46] <noahsiano> I'm on some UX projects for Angular stuff, but I'm mostly working with on the intranet homepage, we're looking at switching over to a new CMS from Adobe
[15:51:07] <noahsiano> So doing mockups in XD and some page prototypes in Wordpress for now
[15:51:37] <noahsiano> Using nodejs, trying to make a neat mdbootstrap wordpress theme
[15:52:05] <taplar> that's cool.  from my perspective it's hard to find good UXers.  make sure to ask lots of questions! :)
[15:52:32] <robertmaxrees> ^ always and forever x1000
[15:53:02] <noahsiano> Good to know. I've really enjoyed working with the UX team, they really have a handle on making workflows make sense to people
[15:53:52] <noahsiano> well, I'm heading out for the weekend, I will probably lurk on here next week.
[15:54:02] <robertmaxrees> :) enjoy!
[16:05:57] <lolii> What do you think ? https://jsfiddle.net/hqefL5ut/
[16:06:53] <lolii> .productType  is a class for all links in  product.php
[16:08:25] <robertmaxrees> that's bad js fwiw.
[16:10:10] <lolii> robertmaxrees fwiw ?
[16:10:23] <robertmaxrees> for what it's worth.
[16:11:08] <lolii> robertmaxrees then ?
[16:11:16] <robertmaxrees> t: "<?php echo $_GET['t'] ?>"
[16:11:39] <robertmaxrees> are you still just interpolating that into the sql query?
[16:11:48] <robertmaxrees> same with t: $(this).text().trim() == "Table" ? "Tabl" : $(this).text().trim()
[16:12:11] <lolii> robertmaxrees  this is how I know how to get parameter value
[16:12:35] <robertmaxrees> so somebody can just link to your page with t=users in the url?
[16:12:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:12:40] <lolii> robertmaxrees you told me that only in server side I can prevent sql injection
[16:12:55] <robertmaxrees> right - your client side makes it look like you haven't fixed that problem yet.
[16:13:52] <lolii> robertmaxrees how I'm suposed to do it ? client can type anything on the url, but the server will prevent sql injection
[16:14:11] <robertmaxrees> did you make your prepared statements and get your server working?
[16:15:34] <lolii> robertmaxrees I'm using PDO and my server is working and using queries like so $results = $conn->query($sql1);
[16:16:06] <lolii> include 'dbconnect.php';     $t = $_GET['t'];     if(isset($t) && $t != " ") { 	   $t = $_GET['t'];
[16:16:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd join ##php and ask for help there.
[16:16:13] <robertmaxrees> bet yeah.
[16:16:36] <lolii> robertmaxrees you mean it's ok ?
[16:16:47] <robertmaxrees> i don't know since i don't use php :)
[16:16:59] <taplar> i linked earlier a page talking about prepared statements
[16:17:18] <robertmaxrees> sounds like reading and effortr
[16:17:56] <lolii> taplar for now I just want to be sure that my client side it's ok
[16:18:05] <lolii> But I'm using prepared statement and PDO
[16:18:23] <taplar> aside from some syntax errors you have with your logic, no, you have an issue with your selector
[16:18:37] <taplar> $(".productType") is a global selector
[16:18:53] <taplar> as you mentioned before, you have links in the footer and your content with that class and you only want to target the ones in your content
[16:19:22] <lolii> taplar Ive deleted productType class for footer links
[16:19:31] <lolii> productType class appears only in Product.php
[16:19:37] <taplar> alright, so that works
[16:19:56] <taplar> so next, why are you doing the following: e.preventDefault();
[16:21:31] <lolii> taplar because I don't want the link to redirect me(reload the page),  if no href in link I'll put href="#" but then I'll have an url ending with # I don't want this is why i'm using preventDefault
[16:21:50] <lolii> this is why***
[16:21:52] <taplar> but those links are never meant to go any where
[16:22:10] <taplar> why do you need anything other than href="#" ?
[16:22:37] <taplar> or are you saying you just don't want the # in the url to show up?
[16:22:40] <robertmaxrees> because he doesn't want the # at the end after the link has been clicked
[16:22:40] <lolii> taplar because if I click on a link with href="#" I'll have an url ending with #
[16:23:01] <lolii> this is why I'm using preventDefault
[16:23:11] <lolii> If I do just href=""  the pae is reloaded
[16:23:13] <robertmaxrees> that can also cause the page to scroll back up.
[16:23:14] <taplar> k i misread that as you'd have some links with a url# in the href.  nvm! :)
[16:23:16] <lolii> page*
[16:24:12] <lolii> robertmaxrees with what ? href=""  or preventdefault ?
[16:25:00] <lolii> robertmaxrees why you told my that's bad js fwiw.  Please suggest
[16:25:04] <robertmaxrees> if you don't use the preventDefault()
[16:25:14] <robertmaxrees> like, you want to use it in this case.
[16:25:24] <taplar> ok, so other than that, and the syntax errors, and whatever issue robert saw with sticking the $_GET directly into the js, I don't have an issue with this logic.
[16:25:49] <robertmaxrees> generating JS via php was my contention.
[16:25:59] <robertmaxrees> but (shrug) baby steps
[16:26:26] <taplar> ah
[16:26:36] <lolii> robertmaxrees also for me but someone her told me to use GET directly and it's the only way I know how to do it... any suggestion ?
[16:27:01] <lolii> taplar what syntax errors ?
[16:27:14] <robertmaxrees> i was also positing that you were still interpolating the t property into the sql query
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> but so long as you're not doing that.
[16:28:23] <taplar> $(".myDivtoBeLoaded) is missing a quote
[16:28:36] <lolii> robertmaxrees I send t with "<?php echo $_GET['t'] ?>"  but if the client try this product?t=maliciouscode  the server will redirect to 404
[16:29:16] <lolii> taplar tha'ts fine for my code Ive edited it in jsfiddle
[16:29:21] <lolii> only
[16:29:27] <lolii> taplar I have a question
[16:39:39] <lolii> Same link edited : https://jsfiddle.net/hqefL5ut/1/  her getData.php will load in myDivtoBeLoaded some div with a form (Add to cart)  this button will change the url to action="product.php?add&id='.$row['id'].'"    (her id is the  id of the product we want to ADD to cart after the div containing the form was loaded from getData.php).  I want to show the product that the user requested from the server, but also changing the url when cl
[16:41:26] <robertmaxrees> that wall of text cut off for anyone else?
[16:41:30] <lolii> So  I have to add another line like the line 2 for my button add to cart ?
[16:41:40] <taplar> yes
[16:41:46] <taplar> * to the cut off text
[16:41:48] <lolii> yes
[16:41:55] <lolii> robertmaxrees
[16:42:11] <lolii> I want to be clear
[16:58:16] <lolii> taplar no.
[17:22:36] <nitrospectide> How can I grab a value from the querystring via jQuery?
[17:23:04] <taplar> you have to parse it yourself.  afaik, jQuery doesn't have a built in way
[17:24:55] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript
[17:26:03] <lolii> taplar when I come to product.php   id is not set and the server side  gives an error Notice: Undefined index: id .  how to check correctly if id exist.  https://jsfiddle.net/qqyefqsL/
[17:29:26] <taplar> that's really a ##php question, but it would be something like https://jsfiddle.net/qqyefqsL/1/
[17:57:27] <m00sehead> any plugins I can use to paginate a bunch of list elements and have a next/prev arrow to cycle through them
[17:57:43] <m00sehead> well not cycle, but click next to see more
[17:57:50] <robertmaxrees> you mean pagination?
[17:57:55] <m00sehead> yeah
[17:58:07] <m00sehead> damn gotta go
[17:58:07] <m00sehead> brb
[17:58:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:58:14] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[17:58:22] <robertmaxrees> should do thjat server-side either way.
[18:11:16] <spaces> welp ?
[18:11:24] <spaces> yelp :P
[18:16:54] <m00sehead> I was just here asking about a generic pagination plugin with a next/prev button that could work by just passing some options like what class to target etc
[18:17:02] <m00sehead> was disconnected though
[18:17:13] <robertmaxrees> m00sehead so i gotta ask the obvious question
[18:17:18] <robertmaxrees> why paginate client-side?
[18:17:37] <m00sehead> not my request, i just implement it
[18:17:40] <m00sehead> i think its stupid too
[18:17:54] <m00sehead> theres like 20 or so items and they want to paginate them in groups of 3
[18:17:54] <robertmaxrees> any reason it's not being implemented server-side?
[18:18:15] <m00sehead> cause its not a large enough number and its staying low
[18:18:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:18:21] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[18:18:25] <m00sehead> its only gonna be 20 max
[18:18:38] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/superRaytin/paginationjs
[18:18:41] <robertmaxrees> maybe this?
[18:19:04] <m00sehead> thats the first one i found and i added it but i cant seem to find how to specify the class i want to target
[18:19:23] <m00sehead> or wait
[18:19:36] <m00sehead> i was confused by the datasource part
[18:19:38] <m00sehead> I can just ignore that
[18:19:53] <m00sehead> i just need to specify the container
[18:20:19] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/superRaytin/paginationjs#quick-start ?
[18:20:33] <robertmaxrees> $('#data-container').html(html); looks like what you want.
[18:20:45] <touchiz> hello
[18:21:07] <robertmaxrees> hello
[18:21:33] <touchiz> anyone can help me please, i want a script, : wait 6 secs and Go to the top of the page if no action has been performed on it
[18:21:53] <robertmaxrees> touchiz are you asking us to write that for you?
[18:21:58] <touchiz> I've tried but I can't. I have javascript errors.
[18:22:03] <touchiz> noooooo
[18:22:04] <touchiz> lol
[18:22:05] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've tried :)
[18:22:08] <touchiz> i give the code
[18:22:22] <touchiz> on pastbin ?
[18:22:28] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle would be preferable.
[18:22:42] <m00sehead> robertmaxrees it says datasource required
[18:22:59] <m00sehead> ill just get the child elements
[18:23:04] <robertmaxrees> m00sehead are you expecting a plugin that'll just read the page and paginate it for you?
[18:23:11] <m00sehead> lol no
[18:23:14] <robertmaxrees> okay heh
[18:23:31] <m00sehead> im just confused why it uses numbers for the datasource and no examples of targeting a list of items
[18:23:36] <m00sehead> elements
[18:24:01] <robertmaxrees> m00sehead because it assumes you're going to feed it data and not markup.
[18:24:16] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to feed it an array of dom nodes and render that yourself tho.
[18:24:44] <touchiz> I started jQuery a sorry week ago and i'm sorry for my bad english, i'm a french guy.
[18:24:47] <robertmaxrees> your callback would basically be $('#data-container').html(data);
[18:24:48] <touchiz> https://pastebin.com/TfHs85MU
[18:25:13] <robertmaxrees> touchiz okay - so what's the error you're getting?
[18:25:50] <touchiz> the page does not go up lol
[18:26:00] <m00sehead> what method would i use to convert a jquery object to an array of nodes?
[18:26:03] <robertmaxrees> touchiz that's not what slideToggle does :)
[18:26:09] <robertmaxrees> m00sehead .map().get()
[18:26:12] <m00sehead> thanks
[18:26:26] <robertmaxrees> m00sehead so basically myArray = $jqueryObject.map(function() { return this }).get();
[18:26:31] <robertmaxrees> the .get() is important there.
[18:26:39] <m00sehead> gotcha
[18:27:24] <robertmaxrees> touchiz https://stackoverflow.com/a/46446801/923919
[18:27:34] <robertmaxrees> actually you want https://stackoverflow.com/a/46153654/923919
[18:28:02] <touchiz> robertmaxrees i try
[18:28:28] <touchiz> yes
[18:28:33] <touchiz> but i don't want use button or click
[18:28:56] <robertmaxrees> touch then don't?
[18:29:07] <touchiz> I want this to happen automatically after 2 seconds.
[18:29:15] <robertmaxrees> touchiz lol
[18:29:22] <robertmaxrees> duder - you can just use the body of the click handler
[18:29:24] <touchiz> what ? :D
[18:29:29] <robertmaxrees> $("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, "slow");
[18:29:35] <robertmaxrees> that's the important part.
[18:29:55] <robertmaxrees> the second part (the whole waiting bit) is a little trickier
[18:30:43] <touchiz> Ok
[18:32:04] <robertmaxrees> get that scroll working?
[18:32:40] <touchiz> no
[18:32:49] <robertmaxrees> shgow me what you've got./
[18:36:59] <touchiz> the page does not go up
[18:37:04] <robertmaxrees> show me your code.
[18:37:10] <robertmaxrees> so i can see.
[18:37:27] <touchiz> wait i try another solution
[18:37:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:37:31] <robertmaxrees> duder.
[18:40:20] <touchiz> ?
[18:40:30] <robertmaxrees> i can tell you exactly what to do.
[18:40:35] <robertmaxrees> but you gotta help me help you.
[18:42:12] <touchiz> Yeah, I'd try it alone first.
[18:42:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:42:47] <robertmaxrees> either way, you need to debounce the function.  gonna be weird to qualify the whole "no user action"
[18:42:55] <robertmaxrees> but that's basically what you want.
[18:44:03] <touchiz> yes
[18:45:45] <touchiz> I can't explain it, but what I want to do will simplify my life and save me the hassle of going back up the page every time, even with a click, I'm so lazy that I prefer to automate everything:D
[18:54:30] <robertmaxrees> that's fine... it's super easy to implement
[19:17:36] <touchiz> this code work :
[19:17:37] <touchiz> $(window).scroll(function() {
[19:17:37] <touchiz> 	$(window).scroll($(window).scrollTop(0));
[19:17:37] <touchiz> });
[19:17:47] <touchiz> but i don't know where i can add the timeout lol
[19:17:55] <robertmaxrees> you need a debounce
[19:18:14] <robertmaxrees> https://gist.github.com/nmsdvid/8807205
[19:18:18] <robertmaxrees> like this
[19:19:23] <touchiz> w00t
[19:19:31] <touchiz> many code for this a simple function :D
[19:21:07] <robertmaxrees> heh debounce isn't simple ;)
[19:21:19] <touchiz> https://pastebin.com/e6FiRgW5
[19:21:35] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you want though.
[19:21:53] <robertmaxrees> also you're repeating the same code twice unnecessarily.
[19:22:03] <robertmaxrees> you don't need that outer $(window).scroll(function() {
[19:25:04] <touchiz> yes
[19:25:08] <touchiz> i don't understand
[19:25:13] <touchiz> i go to sleep
[19:25:17] <touchiz> thx and habve a good day
[19:25:33] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:25:34] <robertmaxrees> welp

[19:34:57] <robertmaxrees> you were thinking of the word whelp fwiw
[19:36:25] <spaces> yeah ! it' dutch, we try to cheese everything ;)
[19:36:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:37:06] <spaces> like the Americans want to influence everything :P
[19:37:17] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:37:20] <robertmaxrees> what?
[19:38:13] <spaces> example, lots of countries use English words for their own words these days... why ? not even because it's international..
[19:38:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm still lost about what you mean by "cheese everything" but alright
[19:40:23] <spaces> it's like changing the truth to your own needs, so the words as well
[19:40:24] <spaces> :P
[19:40:42] <spaces> I just blame the US people for the typo, it's Welp :P
[19:48:29] <robertmaxrees> that's...
[19:48:34] <robertmaxrees> not what that is at all.
[19:48:39] <robertmaxrees> "welp" is a common saying over here.  we'
[19:48:59] <robertmaxrees> just because we happen to spell certain words differently doesn't mean we're trying to "change the truth".
[19:49:39] <robertmaxrees> the pronunciations often closer match the way we pronounce things.  while it's true your language can (and does) shape your perception of the world, simple changes in spelling aren't really going to have that kind of effect.
[19:50:05] <robertmaxrees> context and connotation will have a much better impact in that regard.
