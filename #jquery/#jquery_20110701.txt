[00:19:51] <stefuNz> hi. i want to animate a text: i want it to get bigger having an effect like it's coming towards me ... is there a plugin that can do this or some lines of code ? :)
[00:22:05] <Thomas`-> stefuNz: maybe animate both font-size and line-height
[00:22:16] <atxq> I setup a select list with h1,h2...h6, and when the select list .change(), I want to change .css(). the only problem is that it only changes the select option that was loaded initially
[00:23:05] <atxq> anyone know a solution to this?
[00:24:08] <atxq> var obj = $("#contain option:selected").text();
[00:24:46] <atxq> this is what I am using to fetch the select value
[00:26:10] <coldhead> var obj = $('#contain option').val()
[00:26:29] <atxq> what is the difference?
[00:26:36] <coldhead> maybe this way works?
[00:26:41] <coldhead> :D
[00:26:41] <atxq> thanks
[00:26:54] <coldhead> i'm just guessing, it's my first day using jQuery
[00:27:06] <atxq> yeah, it might. let me try. thanks for a suggestion
[00:27:36] <atxq> at this point I am openned to any suggestions, so thanks
[00:30:02] <atxq> not seeing much difference here than from before
[00:30:42] <Trudko> hi guys to hide all elements which class test i do $(".test").hide() right?
[00:31:23] <atxq> yep
[00:31:30] <coldhead> can you pastebin or jsfiddle the rest of your code, atxq ?
[00:32:45] <atxq> its alot of code

[00:44:08] <atxq> coldhead, I want to change the color of the div two
[00:44:11] <atxq> http://jsfiddle.net/nkDPH/1/
[00:44:50] <atxq> when you select two from the select, it only changes div one
[00:44:59] <coldhead> ah cool
[00:45:15] <atxq> you see my issue?
[00:46:06] <coldhead> yup
[00:46:10] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/nkDPH/2/
[00:46:13] <atxq> it only changes the id of the option that was set when loaded
[00:46:16] <atxq> let me see
[00:46:21] <coldhead> you need to set focus again
[00:46:26] <atxq> don't tell me you fixed the issue?
[00:46:27] <coldhead> inside the click handler()
[00:46:39] <coldhead> you tell me!
[00:46:40] <atxq> are you serious? it works?
[00:46:46] <djQuery> doesnt a select have a val?
[00:46:48] <coldhead> as i understand it, yes
[00:47:11] <atxq> coldhead, you a genius
[00:47:25] <coldhead> aw shucks
[00:47:28] <atxq> thanks
[00:47:33] <coldhead> you are so welcome
[00:47:39] <atxq> been here a while trying to get this working
[00:48:06] <atxq> had saved the option value in a cookie...wow, your awesome
[00:48:15] <coldhead> you're*
[00:48:18] <coldhead> :D
[00:48:20] <djQuery> then why not just $('#select').change(function(){  $('#' + $(this).val()).css('background-color', 'red');});
[00:48:23] <atxq> not even the cookie idea worked
[00:49:15] <atxq> not sure...
[00:50:28] <atxq> wait...I want to define the option value outside of the click function
[00:51:18] <atxq> is it possible?
[00:53:21] <atxq> I have too many .click/.change functions defined
[00:53:43] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/nkDPH/4/
[00:54:13] <djQuery> atxq: ^^^^^^
[00:54:52] <atxq> so I would have to define x=$(this).val() inside all .change functions?
[00:55:18] <atxq> its not possible defining it outside?
[00:55:31] <djQuery> atxq: how many are there?
[00:55:52] <djQuery> atxq: use a class instead of the id?
[00:56:07] <atxq> as of last count, like 50
[00:56:16] <djQuery> atxq: wtf?
[00:57:09] <atxq> yeah...just to render the html I had to use the help of some clever php methods
[00:57:27] <djQuery> atxq: what are u trying to accomplish? see ?demo
[00:57:28] <bot-t> atxq, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:57:59] <djQuery> atxq: can you paste the output of your current php into a demo
[01:00:43] <atxq> I am thinking here what is the best way to go about this
[01:02:20] <lucasw> Have anyone worked with jQuery Mobile in here? there isnt anyone answering in the jquery mobile channel :)
[01:06:07] <atxq> so no way to define the value of the option outside .change?
[01:06:32] <djQuery> sure there is
[01:06:55] <djQuery> atxq: the var x was defined outside of the change in my example.

[01:07:29] <atxq> but the value is defined inside, var x is only initiated outside
[01:07:34] <djQuery> hmmm wasnt what I was looking for
[01:08:05] <djQuery> ok then do var x=$('#select').val();
[01:08:22] <atxq> let me try it here
[01:08:55] <atxq> usually it only changes the value of the option that was selected when page loaded

[01:08:58] <bot-t> atxq, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[01:09:15] <AnthonyCat> Why do we put functions in $(function(){ /* my code */ });
[01:09:37] <djQuery> ?jqf@ AnthonyCat
[01:09:37] <bot-t> AnthonyCat, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[01:10:24] <AnthonyCat> Thanks djQuery I've read that, but where is the part I need?
[01:10:42] <AnthonyCat> ok I found t
[01:11:36] <atxq> x=$('#select').val();
[01:11:42] <AnthonyCat> $("#jquery").get("djQuery").thank().send(" :) ").end().exit()
[01:11:46] <atxq> does not work
[01:12:31] <atxq> I am trying to avoid having to define x inside every function
[01:13:05] <atxq> might be no way around this
[01:14:04] <AnthonyCat> atxq: What are you bring to do?
[01:14:15] <AnthonyCat> trying* not bring
[01:15:54] <atxq> change the value of x outside of .change
[01:17:12] <atxq> the example with the two boxes, I want to define the value of option outside of the .change function and still be able to change the colors of the boxes
[01:17:56] <atxq> but as of yet, the color only changes if you define the value of option inside the function .change
[01:18:04] <atxq> x=$('#select').val();
[01:18:18] <atxq> with something like this inside the function .change
[01:18:38] <atxq> you understand what I am trying to do?
[01:18:39] <djQuery> atxq: well yeah you still need to do something with the value
[01:19:10] <djQuery> var x=$('#select').val();
[01:19:16] <AnthonyCat> atxq: where is x defined? You can access the outside x by using window.x
[01:19:34] <atxq> I want to define it at the top before all the jquery functions
[01:19:40] <atxq> var x=$('#select').val();
[01:19:47] <AnthonyCat> ok, yes, window.x will refer to your outside x
[01:19:57] <atxq> then inside .change call x
[01:20:00] <djQuery> $('#"+x).css('background-color', 'red');
[01:20:33] <atxq> this example doesn't work
[01:20:54] <atxq> it only uses the value of option selected when page was loaded
[01:21:20] <AnthonyCat> yes, why wouldn't it. When the page is loaded, you set x to the value of the input.
[01:21:53] <atxq> then after I want to change the value of x by changing the select
[01:22:28] <atxq> doesn't change though
[01:22:38] <atxq> you following what I am trying to do?
[01:23:22] <AnthonyCat> just do x="something"
[01:23:41] <atxq> outside or inside .change?
[01:23:53] <atxq> I do that outside and it doesn't work
[01:24:15] <AnthonyCat> what do you mean by "doesn't work"?
[01:24:16] <atxq> its kind of funny all this inside/outside stuff...hahahha
[01:24:41] <AnthonyCat> Outside variables will be accessible from the inside, as long as you don't override the variables with a closure.
[01:24:57] <djQuery> AnthonyCat: i believe that he is thinking that jsut setting x=something will case the trigger to happen as well
[01:24:59] <atxq> when I change the value of option, the css only changes the value that was defined when the page loaded
[01:25:34] <AnthonyCat> the css?
[01:25:47] <djQuery> think
[01:26:31] <atxq> yeah, $( the value of the option ).css("color","#0099ff");
[01:27:17] <atxq> but it only changes the id of the value of option when page was loaded...changing the select does not effect the css
[01:27:38] <atxq> I want to avoid x=$('#select').val();
[01:27:51] <atxq> inside all the .change functions
[01:27:58] <atxq> instead of x=$('#select').val();
[01:28:08] <atxq> I want to just use x
[01:28:34] <AnthonyCat> ok, so I think, that you can have maybe:
[01:29:05] <djQuery> oh well we arent getting anywhere with this. we seem to be failing to grasp what you are not grasping.
[01:29:19] <AnthonyCat> .change(function(){   var abc = $(this).val();   $("#"+abc)â€¦.     });
[01:29:27] <AnthonyCat> Yeah, djQuery is right
[01:29:46] <atxq> no var inside .change
[01:30:04] <atxq> is it possible to just have var outside .change
[01:30:24] <djQuery> defined YES, set NO
[01:30:43] <atxq> defined outside, set inside
[01:31:10] <atxq> awesome example, just var stuff outside...possible?
[01:31:21] <AnthonyCat> atxq: .change(function(){ $("#"+$(this).val())â€¦.    }) â€¦ ?
[01:31:39] <atxq> yeah
[01:31:50] <atxq> but...
[01:32:18] <atxq> $(this) is not this, its the value of option, whatever it happens to be
[01:32:57] <atxq> .change does not recognize the current value, only the value that was select when the page loaded
[01:33:24] <atxq> even if you change the value after load, it only uses the old value
[01:33:34] <AnthonyCat> umm.. no
[01:34:13] <AnthonyCat> Does it? I can't help you then sorry
[01:34:23] <atxq> that was why I though...but the current value does not work
[01:34:55] <atxq> you remember my first example on jsfiddle?
[01:35:03] <AnthonyCat> try: .change(function(){   alert("The current value is "+ $(this).val())    })
[01:35:31] <atxq> let me check again
[01:36:06] <atxq> alerts the old value
[01:36:39] <atxq> this is my issue
[01:36:46] <AnthonyCat> I'm looking at your jsfiddle now
[01:37:36] <AnthonyCat> http://jsfiddle.net/QQUEz/
[01:37:37] <atxq> sorry if it is hard to explain. I have been at this for a while now
[01:38:33] <AnthonyCat> or even better: v
[01:38:34] <AnthonyCat> http://jsfiddle.net/QQUEz/1/
[01:38:41] <AnthonyCat> Is that what you want?
[01:39:00] <atxq> I understand why that works...I want to know if you can define  focus = $("#contain option:selected").text(); outside of .change?
[01:39:42] <atxq> inside .change just call focus
[01:39:45] <atxq> possible?
[01:39:56] <AnthonyCat> yes, you can. focus = $("#contain option:selected").text() will set the value of focus to the text when that line of code is executed. If the text is changed later, then focus will not automatically be updated
[01:40:36] <atxq> okay, so how can I update focus outside .change?
[01:40:51] <AnthonyCat> To update focus, just type focus="something"
[01:41:17] <atxq> but then inside .change uses the old value
[01:41:50] <AnthonyCat> nope
[01:42:04] <atxq> $("select").change( function(){ focus = ...new value });
[01:42:12] <AnthonyCat> .change will use the value the focus actually is. The old value will be forgotten once overwritten.
[01:42:51] <atxq> exactly, but its not overwritting here, that why I find this strange
[01:43:11] <atxq> it only recognizes the value of option when page was loaded
[01:43:13] <AnthonyCat> focus = ...new value WILL overwrite
[01:43:43] <AnthonyCat> I suggest you take a look at the fiddle I wrote. Bye
[01:43:44] <atxq> when I change option, does not update the value of focus unless I update it inside .change
[01:44:41] <atxq> I want to update it outside .change...only overwrites it inside the change function
[01:44:46] <AnthonyCat> not tru
[01:44:54] <AnthonyCat> not true. You can update it anywhere
[01:45:12] <atxq> let me try it in jsfiddle...
[01:45:50] <atxq> doesn't work in jsfiddle
[01:46:01] <atxq> check it out
[01:46:08] <AnthonyCat> link please
[01:46:09] <atxq> this is what I am talking about
[01:46:14] <atxq> one moment
[01:47:15] <atxq> http://jsfiddle.net/uW9Av/
[01:47:51] <atxq> overwrite it outside is what I would like
[01:47:53] <AnthonyCat> When are you overwriting it? which line?
[01:47:59] <stefuNz> hi. i want to change the background color of a div (let's say id: #example) from #000000 to #FFFFFF, but it should be a smooth transition ... how can i do that ?
[01:48:07] <atxq> first line
[01:48:39] <AnthonyCat> I think you need a plugin for that stefuNz
[01:48:51] <stefuNz> AnthonyCat: do you know such a plugin ?
[01:48:52] <atxq> plugin?

[01:51:12] <stefuNz> thanks everyone
[01:51:44] <Guest79145> http://jsfiddle.net/uW9Av/1/ @ atxq
[01:52:23] <atxq> Guest79145, thanks
[01:52:43] <atxq> so val() has to be inside .change, right? no way around that?
[01:54:36] <atxq> basicly I am trying to make this as flexiable as possible. so if I get the value from .text() in the future, I hate to have to change 50 .val() to text()
[01:54:50] <Guest79145> no way, because change() - changes the value, you will always have the old one if you read it before change happens
[01:55:08] <atxq> the idea is to be able to change one line of code and update all jquery functions
[01:56:25] <Guest79145> what is your goal?
[01:56:32] <atxq> I am changing .css by changed two select
[01:56:39] <djQuery> then put everything on one line
[01:57:22] <atxq> $( "#"+x.val() ).css("background-color", "red");
[01:57:47] <atxq> x is the value of the first select, red is the value of the second
[01:58:14] <ty2u> hey, how can i make this work jQuery(form1+":submit").click
[01:58:19] <atxq> I wnat to update x when I change the select of red outside .change
[01:58:42] <djQuery> ty2u: what is form1?
[01:59:03] <ty2u> djQuery, its a form object i believe
[01:59:14] <djQuery> jQuery(":submit", form1).click(function(){});
[01:59:29] <ty2u> thanks =)
[01:59:51] <djQuery> ty2u: that only works if form1 is a jquery object
[02:00:05] <Guest79145> $( "#"+x.val() ).css("background-color", y.val()); //where y = $('secondSelect');
[02:00:25] <djQuery> ty2u: you know you could just do $(form1).submit(funciton(){}); right
[02:00:51] <djQuery> ty2u: it would be after the click but before the submit
[02:01:11] <atxq> Guest79145, love the example, but wondering if .val() can be updated outside the .change function
[02:01:14] <ty2u> djQuery, thanks ill try it out
[02:02:04] <djQuery> ty2u: if you need to cancle the submit see ?.stoppropogation
[02:02:06] <bot-t> ty2u, event.stopPropagation() - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[02:02:39] <atxq> I just want to update the values x.val() outside the .change() function
[02:02:45] <ty2u> awesome
[02:03:12] <atxq> all the examples that work .val has to be inside .change
[02:03:34] <Guest79145> http://jsfiddle.net/uW9Av/2/
[02:04:00] <atxq> val() is inside .change in the example
[02:04:15] <atxq> I just want to know if it is possible to have it ouside?
[02:04:25] <Guest79145> you can change value of selects everywhere, val() will always get the current one
[02:04:47] <atxq> I tried using a cookie and had no success
[02:04:56] <Pinehead> I want to add a class at the end of every page load.  However, I do not know any elements that i can append to  or add to in the page.  Any thoughtS?
[02:05:55] <Guest79145> http://jsfiddle.net/uW9Av/3/
[02:05:58] <djQuery> $('body').addClass('js');
[02:06:10] <djQuery> Pinhead: ^^^^^^^^^^^
[02:06:18] <Pinehead> Thanks
[02:06:28] <Pinehead> i did just .add
[02:06:31] <atxq> Guest79145, I need val() outside...val() is still inside .change
[02:07:09] <atxq> I want to replace .val with a variable, or something else
[02:07:59] <Guest79145> ok, then do it
[02:08:06] <Guest79145> what is the problem?
[02:08:08] <atxq> doesn't work
[02:08:22] <Guest79145> example
[02:08:25] <atxq> variable is not update when called
[02:08:40] <djQuery> atxq: you have now run off 4 people from this question it appears.
[02:09:07] <atxq> I just want to know if it is possible...and people getting upset over this?
[02:09:30] <atxq> I have been at this a long while now...just want a straight answer
[02:09:53] <djQuery> not upset just tired if you flooding the channel with the same Q\r and seeing you expect something different
[02:10:00] <atxq> if not possible, then I will move on...but I would like to know why it is not possible
[02:10:07] <Pinehead> $('body').addClass("<div id=\"expose\">Expose goes here</div>"); doesn't seem to add to the page
[02:10:09] <Pinehead> djQuery:

[02:11:10] <atxq> so why no one can give me a straight answer why it doesn't work?
[02:11:11] <Pinehead> yup, that did the trick
[02:11:24] <Pinehead> thanks

[02:11:59] <markj> atxq i havent seen your problem, but if no one can help (and presuming they know what they're doing) then maybe you're not asking the question very well
[02:12:13] <atxq> updating the value of .val() outside .change
[02:12:21] <Guest79145> example
[02:12:24] <djQuery> markj: +++++++
[02:12:40] <Guest79145> markj: +1
[02:13:00] <markj> thats vague
[02:13:50] <markj> do you have a fiddle of it?
[02:15:05] <atxq> I am changing the original example
[02:15:07] <atxq> one moment
[02:15:40] <gym_jane> Aamir, yes it is me again :D
[02:15:55] <atxq> I agree with djQuery though
[02:16:20] <gym_jane> how can i get latest tweets from this? in a list http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.xml?screen_name=cnn
[02:17:01] <albacker> i want to loop through all the .foo elements except the #bar one. Something like $('.foo').each(function() { if ($(this).hasId('bar') {..  but hasId doesn't exist. is there a good way to do this?
[02:17:30] <djQuery> ?.not
[02:17:31] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[02:17:52] <albacker> trying.. thanks
[02:17:56] <djQuery> $('.foo').not('#bar').each
[02:18:55] <atxq> okay, I want to change the second option in the select. .val() should be outside .change(). so here is the example.
[02:19:04] <atxq> http://jsfiddle.net/uW9Av/6/
[02:19:14] <atxq> I just want to know if it is possible?
[02:20:12] <muzone_> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?03 - how come my jQuery Slider won't appear? http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#range
[02:20:34] <Guest79145> do you want to change the second option in the select? correct?
[02:20:41] <atxq> yes
[02:20:50] <atxq> http://jsfiddle.net/uW9Av/7/
[02:21:01] <atxq> this example worked for some reason now
[02:21:13] <Aamir> gym_jane: hi
[02:21:29] <atxq> now its working
[02:21:37] <Guest79145> emm....
[02:21:42] <Aamir> gym_jane:  http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/
[02:21:43] <muzone_> *AIRHOOOOOORN*
[02:21:50] <markj> that is not what you asked
[02:21:52] <atxq> I want to update the .val outside .change, and now its working
[02:21:57] <muzone_> What I asked was
[02:22:04] <muzone_> Aamir, markj, atxq
[02:22:07] <muzone_> Fine young men and women
[02:22:09] <muzone_> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?03 - how come my jQuery Slider won't appear? http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#range
[02:22:33] <atxq> slider is a div
[02:22:59] <muzone_> It is in the demo at jqueryui.com too!
[02:23:26] <atxq> yeah, <div id="slider-range"></div>
[02:23:31] <Aamir> muzone_: do you have slider ui included?
[02:23:53] <muzone_> atxq: So? I got that too..
[02:24:31] <muzone_> Aamir: Yes most definitely - I built me a custom one
[02:24:39] <atxq> then Aamir would be my second idea
[02:25:17] <Aamir> muzone_:  http://jsbin.com/ixapik/edit
[02:25:18] <muzone_> Aamir: with Core + Slider
[02:25:59] <Aamir> muzone_: i think you need to include ui.css file ;)
[02:26:28] <muzone_> ooooh the css..
[02:26:39] <muzone_> thanks king !!
[02:27:31] <Aamir> muzone_: no its not just css, i think u missed the slider plugin so see the above jsbin
[02:28:30] <Whirl3d> How do you change a css definition? I want a button that makes the text larger, so it should change the CSS rule, rather than just the elements. Any suggestions?
[02:29:05] <muzone_> Aamir: Cant be - http://jsbin.com/ixapik/edit - there I included my own jquery-1.6.min.js and jquery_ui-1.8.14.custom.min.js
[02:29:10] <muzone_> it works just as fine
[02:29:16] <djQuery> Whirl3d: change it for the whole doc?
[02:29:42] <Whirl3d> Yeah. Just for selected rules.
[02:29:49] <djQuery> $('body').toggleClass('blind');
[02:30:11] <Whirl3d> huh?
[02:30:27] <muzone_> Aamir: ah nah you're right it was the CSS
[02:30:43] <djQuery> .content.blin {text-size: largets}
[02:31:01] <Whirl3d> In other words, the definition for "bodyText" uses 12px font-size and I want a button that changes "bodyText" definition to 14px, then 18px, etc.
[02:31:33] <Whirl3d> So when the next page loads via ajax it will also have the larger font size
[02:31:52] <seutje> iterate over document.styleSheets?
[02:32:10] <seutje> ?mdc document.styleSheets @ Whirl3d
[02:32:12] <bot-t> Whirl3d, document.styleSheets - MDN Docs - Returns a list of stylesheet objects for stylesheets explicitly linked into or embedded in a document. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/document.styleSheets
[02:32:34] <atxq> or use a cookie
[02:32:54] <seutje> for font-size, u should simply be able to just change root font-size and have it cascade
[02:33:08] <seutje> depends how ur shizzle is set up though
[02:35:39] <Whirl3d> seutje, using % or em for units? Thanks everyone for the help.
[02:36:26] <durre> how can I select elements that have all of the classes. $('.class1.class2.class2') doesn't seem to work
[02:36:32] <dr0id> $('.class1 .class2 .class3')
[02:36:49] <seutje> Whirl3d: don't rly feel like going into the vast world of font-sizing right now, there's plenty of articles on it
[02:36:52] <dr0id> aah, element that has all of those classes
[02:37:11] <seutje> durre: should work, got a concrete example?
[02:37:14] <Whirl3d> seutje, no problem. Sorry to hassle you. Thanks for the help
[02:37:49] <dr0id> should work though
[02:38:50] <durre> sorry guys... I described it wrong. ".class1 .class2 .class3" will in CSS give me the right class3 object that I can style. I want to do the same kind of selection with jquery
[02:39:14] <gym_jane> Thanks Aamir, last question for the day.... i promise... where am i going wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/
[02:39:32] <gym_jane> it should behave like the newsticker example here http://medienfreunde.com/lab/innerfade/
[02:39:41] <muzone_> gym_jane: are you one of those female bodybuilders?
[02:40:37] <dannyzb> I've run into a major issue with jQuery and IE<8 - Whenever I use fadeIn or fadeOut with it the transperacy of png images is all messed up
[02:40:41] <dannyzb> I get a weird black border
[02:41:22] <rahmen> Anyone who's got any experience with xslt-plugins? I've tried this but I can't make it work: http://johannburkard.de/software/xsltjs/
[02:41:29] <dannyzb> I tried to use AlphaImageLoader on the images but when I use it on the png background no click / hover events are activated by the browser for any of the child elements ><
[02:42:43] <Whirl3d> dannyzb, http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bobosola/
[02:43:38] <dannyzb> whirl : I officially removed support for IE6 .. I'm trying to make it work on IE8 here
[02:44:22] <Whirl3d> It seems to work for IE all versions for me.
[02:44:36] <gym_jane> muzone_ hell no
[02:44:52] <gym_jane> can someone please hlpe me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/
[02:45:05] <gym_jane> the tweets should be ticking one by one
[02:46:46] <dannyzb> thanks man but I'm really trying to avoid all that ugly IE6 style hack-based coding
[02:46:51] <dannyzb> thats why I don't support IE6 in the first place
[02:47:17] <dannyzb> doesn't make sense to me .. when fading out all jQuery based controls have messed up images because of this bug
[02:47:35] <dannyzb> ui-icon *
[02:48:09] <Whirl3d> are you using 1.6 or 1.6.1? There's an opacity bug in 1.6
[02:48:31] <dannyzb> 1.6.1
[02:49:48] <Northwoods> hi doncam
[02:50:31] <dannyzb> I wish microsoft a slow and painful death
[02:50:41] <Soothsayer> Any recommendations for a placeholder plugin?
[02:55:24] <dannyzb> I have a question : say I made a jquery UI Controls pack .. which controls would you want included ?
[02:55:39] <gym_jane> anyone?
[02:56:17] <ravenzz> Soothsayer http://webcloud.se/code/jQuery-Placeholder/
[02:56:35] <ravenzz> gym_jane i miss your question
[02:56:49] <gym_jane> can someone please hlpe me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/
[02:56:57] <rahmen> Anyone who has tried a xslt-plugin that works in both ie and ff?
[02:57:06] <gym_jane> basically each tweet should appear one by one
[02:57:36] <dannyzb> Is it a bug or a question?
[02:57:48] <gym_jane> ah wait i got it wrong brb
[02:59:40] <gym_jane> Here http://jsfiddle.net/pJgyu/12646/
[03:00:06] <gym_jane> I think it is a bug, but i could be going wrong somewhere
[03:00:59] <gym_jane> The tweets should tick one by one like this example http://medienfreunde.com/lab/innerfade/
[03:03:32] <ravenzz> gym_jane http://www.bahiastudio.net/labs/freebies/tweets/
[03:03:57] <jdsjdwieodjs> hello
[03:04:04] <jdsjdwieodjs> sup
[03:04:51] <gym_jane> ravenzz i want just the tweets no the time etc and i need them to tick one by one
[03:05:34] <gym_jane> I can get the tweets using that plugin but integrating innerFade plugin seems to be the issue
[03:05:39] <jdsjdwieodjs> i am a spam bot
[03:05:46] <jdsjdwieodjs> i mean look at my nick
[03:05:54] <jdsjdwieodjs> what is wrong with it
[03:08:04] <jdsjdwieodjs> hey
[03:09:43] <nail_> I guess the tweet plugin would need a callback option so you can start innerfade after the tweets have been inserted, it doesn't seem possible to do what you want only with those 2 plugins
[03:17:29] <Trisox[work]> good morning
[03:19:05] <gym_jane> nail_ I have the same feeling but am not sure how to implement it
[03:20:24] <nail_> gym_jane: the blocker is the tweet plugin, you need a more flexible one if there is, or implement your own
[03:22:44] <nail_> if you want to stick to innerfade, it must definitively be called after your <ul> has been populated
[03:26:12] <AnthonyCat> Say I have <div id="x"><p><span><span class="red"></span></span></p></div>, and I have $x=$("#x"). How can I get the .red one that is under $x?
[03:26:55] <ravenzz> $x.find('.red:first')
[03:26:56] <ravenzz> ?
[03:27:20] <AnthonyCat> ok, thanks ravenzz
[03:27:34] <AnthonyCat> I just need to know .find really
[03:27:38] <AnthonyCat> cheers :)
[03:27:42] <ravenzz> np
[03:28:35] <ravenzz> or just
[03:28:37] <ravenzz> $('div#x .red')
[03:30:47] <ravenzz> is there someone from oslo?

[03:41:56] <k_89> can someone help me out
[03:44:59] <k_89> anyone there
[03:45:01] <k_89> ??
[03:47:15] <Trisox[work]> k_89
[03:47:34] <Trisox[work]> $('#page_manager .save_button').live('click',function(e){
[03:48:49] <Trisox[work]> k_89: ?
[03:49:02] <k_89> Trisox[work], its the same thing, this way i can add more event listeners later, but i'll try that
[03:49:22] <k_89> *this way = way i used .live()
[03:49:28] <Trisox[work]> $('#page_manager .save_button').live('click whatever something more and more',function(e){
[03:49:31] <Trisox[work]> just use spaces
[03:49:52] <muzone_> Why are jQuery / jQuery UI's CSS selectors structured-like-this and not structured_like_this which is normal?
[03:50:21] <Trisox[work]> muzone_: example?
[03:50:54] <muzone_> I was at this jQuery convention the other day and me and the guys joked a lot about it - how painful it is to always go and manually rename all the CSS selectors in jQuery / jQuery UI just to make them fit with our own CSS which use underscores and not dashes
[03:51:04] <muzone_> Trisox[work]: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[03:51:57] <k_89> Trisox[work], no use, same error
[03:51:57] * Trisox[work] is not going to answer that pfff..
[03:52:15] <Trisox[work]> k_89: you did remove the } at the end?
[03:52:30] <k_89> Trisox[work], yes, same exception
[03:52:51] <muzone_> Trisox[work]: dont be a cunt
[03:53:04] <Trisox[work]> muzone_: say what
[03:53:12] <Trisox[work]> its just a way of style
[03:53:26] <Trisox[work]> css i mean using camelcasses or not al that kind of things
[03:53:30] <Trisox[work]> there is no standard..
[03:53:35] <Trisox[work]> so....
[03:53:53] <Trisox[work]> i advice you to use what ever feels good
[03:54:05] <seutje> lube();
[03:54:15] <muzone_> true true words brother
[03:54:21] <muzone_> whatever feels good
[03:54:23] <toomuchinformati> I have a questino about the jquery color plugin
[03:54:24] <toomuchinformati> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[03:54:24] <Trisox[work]> and wy the hell would you rename all the css selectors in CSS selectors in jQuery / jQuery UI
[03:54:28] <toomuchinformati> question, even
[03:54:41] <muzone_> to me _ feels good and when jquery use - that makes me feel bad
[03:54:47] <Trisox[work]> sorry we only do questino's
[03:54:48] <Trisox[work]> ;)
[03:54:55] <toomuchinformati> here's an example of the color plugin in use:
[03:54:56] <toomuchinformati> $(this).stop(true, true).animate( { backgroundColor: sBgColor }, iAniSpeed);
[03:54:58] <thyphus> i have multiple checkboxes and one checkbox, to toggle attr("checked"). if i reload the container of the checkboxes via .load(), the togglefunction will not work anymore. is that a known problem?! is there a way to fix it?
[03:55:08] <Trisox[work]> muzone_: you still have not made a point ..
[03:55:15] <toomuchinformati> but the sBgColor variable is inside my .js
[03:55:19] <toomuchinformati> and it belongs in the CSS
[03:55:29] <Trisox[work]> thyphus: try ?live
[03:55:29] <toomuchinformati> I just want jQuery to swap the class
[03:55:32] <Trisox[work]> ?live
[03:55:33] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[03:55:36] <toomuchinformati> and animate the resulting color change
[03:55:48] <Trisox[work]> ?toggle
[03:55:48] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[03:55:54] <toomuchinformati> sorry for the mid-conversation noise
[03:56:01] <Trisox[work]> np
[03:56:19] <thyphus> thanks
[03:56:21] <thyphus> will read that
[03:56:40] <muzone_> Trisox[work]: i was about to
[03:57:00] <thyphus> Trisox[work]: thanks. live() works fine
[03:57:04] <Trisox[work]> np ;)
[03:57:05] <muzone_> but then i lit up this joint and i was like.. fuck it :)
[03:57:23] <Trisox[work]> cool story bro!
[03:57:49] <toomuchinformati> so... can I use the color plugin to animate color changes, when I only make changes to element classes?
[03:57:59] <toomuchinformati> rather than assign colors using jquery?
[03:58:22] <Trisox[work]> ?p @ âˆš
[03:58:22] <bot-t> âˆš, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:58:25] <Trisox[work]> ?p @ toomuchinformati:
[03:58:26] <bot-t> toomuchinformati:, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:01:40] <toomuchinformati> Trisox[work]: here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/9UJUY/1/
[04:01:57] <toomuchinformati> that script is successful in changing my background colour
[04:02:05] <toomuchinformati> but I'd prefer that it only toggles the .over class
[04:02:15] <toomuchinformati> so that all color references stay in the CSS
[04:04:43] <Trisox[work]> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/9UJUY/2/
[04:05:18] <Trisox[work]> you could also use it to add classes.. to it ect
[04:06:42] <toomuchinformati> Trisox[work]: is there any way I can eliminate the BgColor variables from the js?
[04:07:23] <toomuchinformati> would this be valid?
[04:07:23] <toomuchinformati> $(this).stop(true, true).toggleClass('over').animate( { backgroundColor }, iAniSpeed);
[04:07:36] <toomuchinformati> i.e. remove the argument from backgroundColor?
[04:07:45] * toomuchinformati tries it
[04:07:51] <Trisox[work]> toomuchinformati:  i would take a look @ http://jqueryui.com/docs/switchClass/
[04:07:53] <Trisox[work]> or something
[04:08:16] <toomuchinformati> so it's something that'll need jQueryUI?
[04:08:22] <toomuchinformati> to change a class and animate its effect?
[04:08:44] <Trisox[work]> prob i would look @ it i mean i never used that
[04:09:52] <toomuchinformati> well, my attempt to remove the the color from the above code didn't work
[04:10:02] <quicksilver> toomuchinformati: Yes, that's a jquery UI feature (animating between classes)
[04:10:11] <toomuchinformati> ok, good to know
[04:10:14] <Trisox[work]> ;)
[04:10:17] <VictorCL2> hellow :)
[04:10:24] <Trisox[work]> yow
[04:10:25] <toomuchinformati> am I being overly anal in trying to eliminate color references from my js?
[04:10:43] <VictorCL2> anyone knows how to get invitations for google+ ?
[04:10:46] <quicksilver> it's a reasonable idea, toomuchinformati
[04:10:46] <toomuchinformati> probably not worth introducing jquery UI for
[04:10:54] <quicksilver> your designer should ideally be in control of colour
[04:11:04] <quicksilver> but only you know the real cost/benefit analysis for you.
[04:11:18] <toomuchinformati> yes... ok, I'll dwell on that
[04:11:23] <seutje> toomuchinformati: consider data-attr
[04:11:29] <toomuchinformati> thanks for your help Trisox[work], quicksilver
[04:11:36] <Trisox[work]> np good luck
[04:11:44] <toomuchinformati> seutje: not heard of it yet
[04:11:46] <Trisox[work]> seutje: thats good one ;)
[04:12:13] <seutje> it beats trying to grab a styleRule's corresponding :hover declaration
[04:12:20] <Trisox[work]> toomuchinformati: thats the html5 data element introduced and suported since jquery 1.4.3 if i remember
[04:12:36] <toomuchinformati> will my document need to be in HTML5?
[04:12:39] <Trisox[work]> no
[04:12:44] <toomuchinformati> and will it work in IE?
[04:12:47] <Trisox[work]> yes
[04:12:48] <seutje> like <li class="foo" data-hoverbg="#564865"> ...
[04:12:53] <Trisox[work]> ;)
[04:13:05] <seutje> then just grab it in ut js using .data('hoverbg')
[04:13:09] <toomuchinformati> but then the color ref will live in the HTML, still not the CSS!
[04:13:16] <toomuchinformati> also not the right place for it
[04:13:32] <toomuchinformati> arguably a better place though
[04:13:33] <seutje> have fun iterating over stylerules then
[04:13:38] <Trisox[work]> $this.data ('hoverbg')
[04:13:38] <toomuchinformati> since it'll be content-managable
[04:13:59] <Trisox[work]> mm
[04:14:11] <toomuchinformati> of course, the HTML will no longer validate
[04:14:14] <toomuchinformati> but I can live with that
[04:14:17] <Trisox[work]> sure it is
[04:14:17] <Trisox[work]> ;)
[04:15:16] <emil-malmoe> I'm reading the jQuery book and I'm following an example. There are two if-statements: the first one is if ($(event.target).is('.button')) {}
[04:15:26] <emil-malmoe> the second one is if (event.target.id == 'switcher-default')
[04:16:10] <emil-malmoe> is the $() used on the first statement because I am chaining it with the is() function?
[04:16:39] <seutje> toomuchinformati: what do u mean, it won't validate?
[04:17:14] <Trisox[work]> seutje: is it not posible to grab the css of an other element and use that as a var?
[04:17:18] <Trisox[work]> to animate
[04:17:20] <seutje> emil-malmoe: .is is a method available on jQuery collections, not DOM elements
[04:17:21] <toomuchinformati> seutje: the attribute data-hoverbg doesn't exist in the HTML spec
[04:17:43] <seutje> Trisox[work]: yea, just a royal pain in the ass
[04:17:54] <Trisox[work]> sure but it could work i think..
[04:18:30] <Trisox[work]> using .css() to grab the background color.. of element with css applied to it
[04:18:30] <seutje> toomuchinformati: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes
[04:18:35] <Trisox[work]> ;)
[04:18:41] <seutje> Trisox[work]: that doesn't grab the hover style
[04:18:53] <emil-malmoe> seutje: thanks, now i get it! :)
[04:18:53] <Trisox[work]> no but then you need 2
[04:19:02] <Trisox[work]> 2 dummy elements..
[04:19:18] <seutje> the idea is to animate background-color on hover, using :hover and css animations where possible, no?
[04:19:20] <Trisox[work]> also ugly though
[04:19:28] <emil-malmoe> haha, now it feels like i should have understood that myself. anyhow, thanks for your help!

[04:54:43] <flea> Hi, I am trying to apply a custom js file to alter elements in my site.  But it is not making the change, $("element").addClass("ui-widget-header");    however, in firebug, if i add this class manually, i can see the changes.  Looking to know what I may have done wrong.
[04:56:06] <flea> currently the contents of my js file is simply that one line for testing.  the script file is src'd from the header just as is the jquery/ui js files from the distribution example html file.
[04:56:37] <flea> s/head not header
[04:57:13] <Trisox> document.ready?
[04:57:29] <flea> Trisox, ahh, i am not using that.
[04:57:33] <Trisox> :P

[05:29:41] <schweizer> hi
[05:30:15] <schweizer> i have a own jquery function like $.fn.myFunc = function() {....}. in that function i want to overwrite .val(). is that possible?
[05:30:57] <sadmicrowave> schweizer, $('foo').val( newVal );
[05:31:22] <Trisox> yup
[05:32:11] <MoTiOnXml> where can I get the original source code for jQuery UI?
[05:32:20] <MoTiOnXml> can't seem to find it from the original site
[05:32:30] <schweizer> sadmicrowave: well i want to overwrite .val(), meaning change its functionality
[05:37:18] <seutje> paul_irish: it was, they even had blue ice cream!!
[05:38:04] <seutje> schweizer: if u did that inside that function, it would only be changed once that function is called
[05:38:14] <seutje> somehow I sense that this is not what ur after
[05:38:19] <VictorCL2> fuck ... why does width is th and height  is ht ?? .. I get all mix up all the time Â¬Â¬
[05:38:47] <seutje> VictorCL2: open vs closed sound?
[05:43:28] <schweizer> seutje: yes that is what i want. i want to change the val function only for dom elements that have the .myFunc() applied to
[05:46:03] <schweizer> ...if this is even possible
[05:56:02] <Engin> Whirl3d, because docs say .load is unreliable
[05:56:12] <Engin> and i know this is a reply delayed like 1 day :D
[05:57:29] <sadmicrowave> schweizer, put $(this).val( newVal ); in your myFunc function and it will apply it to only the element that .myFunc() is called on
[05:57:46] <sadmicrowave> or the javascript way. this.value = newVal;

[06:07:40] <juria_roberts> osfameron: what if i want only the anchor tags within a div whose id i have?
[06:07:43] <toxz> juria_roberts - $("#preview_page a").get() isnt enough?
[06:07:48] <osfameron> juria_roberts: the jQuery docs should have lots of good examples

[06:10:33] <toxz> MoTiOnXml - http://jqueryui.com/download - i think under "source"
[06:10:36] <qvarkk> which is the best way to animate the size of a image with a intervall....  .animate() and settimeout?

[06:17:23] <sadmicrowave> santa is a pedifile?
[06:17:31] <slartsa> no, I have another stupid question for you :)
[06:17:37] <sadmicrowave> ooooh
[06:17:42] <sadmicrowave> go for it
[06:17:47] <slartsa> ok that was already one but yet another :D
[06:19:27] <sadmicrowave> whats your question?
[06:20:36] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: You have any good ideas to my problem? I tried to have my input fields valued by typing stuff in them and hitting submit with this: onclick="$('#field').val( $('#field').val() )" and I wanted this to show in source (because I desperately need the values to be shown in source) but with no luck
[06:21:24] <b-lew> Can I score some jquery help. I'm just trying to get this to work.
[06:21:46] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, you cannot alter your source after the page loads...source is exactly what it sounds like, the source that the page is created from.
[06:22:01] <slartsa> well I mean what shows up in developer tools
[06:22:16] <slartsa> it shows dynamically created elements but it doesn't shot altering values
[06:22:16] <sadmicrowave> so you mean console.log for firebug?
[06:22:30] <slartsa> well something like that, I'm using chrome
[06:22:48] <sadmicrowave> ok, well perhaps you can tell me why you need these values in a console and we can find a solution
[06:22:56] <sadmicrowave> what do you plan on doing with these values?
[06:24:28] <slartsa> I need to place those inputs in certain spots and have the possibility to resize them (all this you saw a couple days back) and after all this I need to be able to create forms where I have those input fields right where I want them and resized as I wish
[06:24:31] <sadmicrowave> f.y.i, with your code you posted you are doing this: if I have an textbox with the text "hello world" in it. when you click submit you are taking "hello world" and putting it back in the exact same spot you got it from....that accomplishes nothing
[06:24:41] <shrys> Hey. I have a small problem while using jQuery to catch events related to checking/unchecking checkboxes. Gist - https://gist.github.com/1058535 . Where am I going wrong ?
[06:24:51] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: yeah I figured :D
[06:25:11] <slartsa> but I thought it would be determined as the value which could be seen with dev tools
[06:25:55] <sadmicrowave> lets stop talking about dev tools and start talking about what your js page sees instead.
[06:26:03] <sadmicrowave> thats more important
[06:26:07] <b-lew> can anyone help me out with a fx effect.. http://pastie.org/2149881 slideLeft isn't working
[06:26:43] <sadmicrowave> slartsa, maybe you could make a jsfiddle of what you are trying to do...I'm still not fully understanding your intentions
[06:27:05] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: wait a sec
[06:27:17] <sadmicrowave> 1 sec is over

[06:32:15] <Maarten_PI> hi guys, I've been messing around with an issue. i'm generating div's with a click event, than i try to add a click-event on the new div's, but it can't get it to work. anyone any ideas?
[06:32:26] <sadmicrowave> shrys, I know what your problem is though
[06:33:03] <shrys> sadmicrowave: Any pointers would really be helpful . .
[06:33:54] <sadmicrowave> shrys, .live('change') is an event like .click(). After you set all the checkboxes to 'checked' you arn't executing that event again...so its callback won't ever execute... I'll make a jsfiddle and show you
[06:35:32] <shrys> sadmicrowave: The thing that confuses me, is that, the event gets fired when I individually check/uncheck checkboxes.

[06:35:50] <laerti> artur: i have a slider in the main content that has a white background, if i remove the background the slides overlaping, so i must to change the transition or make the sliders hide when the new one comes
[06:36:04] <sadmicrowave> shrys, as it should.  like I said, .live() is an event just like .click() so it will only get executed if you tell it to
[06:36:16] <sadmicrowave> or rather, if the user performs the event

[06:38:21] <shrys> sadmicrowave: Got it! Thanks a lot !
[06:39:05] <gnrlbzik> Hey guys, any one has extensive experience with modifying ui autocomplete?
[06:39:41] <Maarten_PI> i know were the problem is, but don't really know how to fix it. the thing is, the element hasn't been loaded yet, so i can't do anything with it, but how to add events to newly generated divs and spans?
[06:39:56] <gnrlbzik> live
[06:40:18] <gnrlbzik> you can use .live()
[06:40:31] <Maarten_PI> ok, cool, giving it a try
[06:40:47] <gnrlbzik> it will attach any event listener ever time new item is injected to dom
[06:40:55] <jeffsmykil> gnrlbzik: any idea on the check box function?
[06:40:57] <Maarten_PI> awesome, thx
[06:40:59] <jeffsmykil> should i just use click?
[06:41:18] <gnrlbzik> what about it?
[06:41:39] <jeffsmykil> im using click(function ()
[06:41:44] <jeffsmykil> is there something more checkbox oriented?
[06:42:09] <gnrlbzik> not sure what you mean? what are you trying to achieve?
[06:42:29] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, .change() ?
[06:42:51] <jeffsmykil> change would probablyu be better thankyou
[06:43:01] <gnrlbzik> any one got any experience with ui autocomplete?

[07:02:06] <silverd> afternoon guys, I am using to the dataTables plugin to dynamically add new rows (using fnAddData()) to my table.  How would I go about assigning my custom class after the row has been added as I cannot seem to chain on the .addClass after the .fnAddData()
[07:03:53] <b-lew> sadmicrowave -> http://turnpost.com/clients/CSP/index.html I'm using jquery ui and I'm thinking its not the best way to go anymore. I've been trying to get an animate function to work with my hover for hours now and no such luck. Any way I could score some help?
[07:06:50] <b-lew> I basically just want the content to slide in from the left and go back to the left when mouseout
[07:07:07] <b-lew> does that make sense at all?
[07:07:08] <sadmicrowave> ok
[07:08:03] <Soothsayer> Looking for advice: When you are doing ajax requests from within a JS file, how do you get the base url of the website for the request url?
[07:08:11] <laerti> artur_: artur: i have a slider in the main content that has a white background, if i remove the background the slides overlaping, so i must to change the transition or make the sliders hide when the new one comes
[07:09:10] <rns> anyone know why this isn't making my submit button styled with the JQUI button? http://jsfiddle.net/BeqWR/
[07:13:44] <DShepherd> hello all. I am a newbie to jquery, I need some help. I am interested in retrieving and manipulating the contents of an html element (<div id="hiworld">Hello World</div>). Can anyone recommend the correct method I need to call?
[07:14:04] <Brodingo> $('#hiworld')
[07:14:56] <DShepherd> Brodingo: that would return just Hello World or an object that references the hiworld element?
[07:15:24] <Brodingo> its a jquery object with the DOM element #hiworld
[07:15:45] <Brodingo> $('#hiworld').text(); //"Hello World"
[07:16:59] <DShepherd> Brodingo: ok. Want if I wanted to change the contents of the element would this be correct? $('#hiworld').text('JQuery is quite useful');
[07:17:01] <DShepherd> ?
[07:17:15] <DShepherd> s/Want/What
[07:17:19] <Brodingo> yes
[07:17:38] <DShepherd> Brodingo: thank you. I'll be back after these messages
[07:18:53] <r0bot> hi all
[07:19:13] <r0bot> can someone give me some info on .append()
[07:19:14] <r0bot> ?
[07:19:42] <r0bot> anyone ?
[07:19:54] <nahuel> don't ask to ask, just askâ€¦
[07:19:59] <r0bot> $('#manageCQ').click(function() { 		$.post("ManageCQ.php",  		function(data){  		var content = $(data).find( '#content' );         $( "#a_container" ).empty().append(content); 		}); 		 });
[07:20:04] <r0bot> why this outputs
[07:20:05] <r0bot> nothing
[07:20:09] <r0bot> when i see the server respons
[07:20:14] <r0bot> has the html page
[07:20:46] <r0bot> any ideas ?
[07:23:01] <drwho> r0bot, try making seperate calls then trying to empty and append on the same statement like $("#a_container").empty(); $("#a_container").append(content);
[07:23:13] <drwho> r0bot, also what is the type of data you are passing to the function?
[07:23:21] <drwho> you should define that in your post call
[07:23:30] <drwho> is it json, html what?
[07:23:34] <r0bot> html
[07:23:52] <r0bot> i request tophp to output html page
[07:23:55] <Brodingo> ?html
[07:23:56] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[07:24:00] <r0bot> and i want to load it in the div
[07:26:03] <aaronmcadam> hiya paul_irish, been a while man!
[07:26:04] <r0bot> ok now with this
[07:26:06] <r0bot> $('#manageCQ').click(function() { 		$.post("ManageCQ.php",  		function(data){  		var content = $(data).html(data);         $( "#a_container" ).empty();         $( "#a_container" ).append(content); 		}); 		 }); });
[07:26:09] <r0bot> i get the page
[07:26:14] <r0bot> but i get it 3 times
[07:26:22] <r0bot> and when i do a normal call href
[07:26:25] <r0bot> for example
[07:26:28] <r0bot> everything is ok
[07:26:31] <Brodingo> no, you dont need to separate though calls
[07:26:36] <r0bot> but with jquery post
[07:26:49] <r0bot> its 3 times the same thing
[07:27:20] <aaronmcadam> $(data).html(data)?
[07:27:28] <Brodingo> yeah what is that
[07:27:32] <r0bot> i:D
[07:27:34] <r0bot> im not sure
[07:27:36] <r0bot> but it worked
[07:27:40] <aaronmcadam> looks like you're overwriting itself
[07:27:43] <Brodingo> its redundant
[07:27:47] <aaronmcadam> yep
[07:27:49] <r0bot> yes i guess
[07:28:01] <r0bot> can you give me the right syntax ?
[07:28:04] <Brodingo> $( "#a_container" ).html(data);
[07:28:05] <r0bot> for that
[07:28:05] <Brodingo> boom
[07:28:11] <r0bot> let me try
[07:28:19] <Brodingo> no other shit
[07:28:23] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:28:35] <aaronmcadam> emphasis on the shit
[07:28:41] <Brodingo> maybe even cache $('#a_container') before hand
[07:28:42] <r0bot> omg god bless you
[07:28:45] <r0bot> that worked
[07:28:59] <r0bot> i guess i need a break
[07:29:13] <aaronmcadam> yeah go write some php :P
[07:29:16] <r0bot> thanks to all of you guys
[07:29:24] <Brodingo> cheer
[07:29:25] <Brodingo> s
[07:29:28] <r0bot> im doing it for 10 straight hours now :D
[07:29:40] <aaronmcadam> you really are a robot then
[07:29:41] <r0bot> but this jquery stuff is new to me
[07:29:51] <r0bot> and i mess it up big time
[07:30:03] <aaronmcadam> check out the JavaScript plugin for jQuery, it's awesome, it'll help you a lot
[07:30:14] <Brodingo> wut
[07:30:18] <aaronmcadam> ;)
[07:30:24] <rio{> is scroll event not supported with live() still?
[07:30:34] <loxs> how can I delete a selected element. for example something like $('selector').each(function(){(how do I remove them)})
[07:30:55] <Brodingo> $(selector).remove()
[07:31:00] <aaronmcadam> rio, you want to attach an event to a dynamic item's scroll?
[07:31:06] <Brodingo> no need for each loxs
[07:32:43] <rns> anyone know why this isn't making my submit button styled with the JQUI button? http://jsfiddle.net/BeqWR/
[07:34:09] <loxs> Brodingo, hmm... that doesn't seem to work
[07:34:26] <Brodingo> ?p @ loxs
[07:34:27] <bot-t> loxs, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:36:34] <loxs> Brodingo, sorry, I managed to make it work. The problem was that I used   elem.remove() instead of $(elem).remove()
[07:36:56] <Brodingo> there ya go
[07:37:19] <dv310p3r> I love jQuery, but sometime the fadeIn and fadeOut, slide, even the UI specific effects are clunky and skip instead of transition cleanly. Are there any tips for how to make this work less clunky.
[07:37:56] <Trisox> friday friday friday  its friday  friday  friday
[07:38:06] <Brodingo> ?friday
[07:38:07] <bot-t> fun fun FUN <strong>FUN</strong>
[07:38:50] <qin> hm, what means $(".menu > li")? Or how to formulate: on click div class foo, do bar to li with class foo?
[07:39:46] <Brodingo> $('div.foo').click(function(){$('li.foo') ...})
[07:40:12] <Uatec> hiya
[07:40:16] <Uatec> if the jquery Change() event returns false... what does that mean?
[07:40:50] <Brodingo> it doesnt?
[07:40:55] <dv310p3r> Sometime the fadeIn and fadeOut, slide, even the UI specific effects are clunky and skip instead of transition cleanly. Are there any tips for how to make this work less clunky.
[07:41:11] <qin> Brodingo: So with: $('.foo').click(function(){$('li.foo') ...}) event will be trigerred either by div, or li, right?
[07:41:16] <gnrlbzik> has any one changed ui autocomplete?
[07:41:24] <Brodingo> qin yeah

[07:42:07] <Brodingo> dv310p3r: maybe that ^
[07:42:15] <qin> ok, one more, why li with a href do not work in all (on mouse click) scripts?
[07:42:34] <Brodingo> li should not have an href
[07:42:39] <Brodingo> thats for anchor elements
[07:43:01] <dv310p3r> Brodingo, thanks i'll take a look
[07:43:05] <qin> Brodingo: I ment <li><a href >...

[07:49:34] <qin> Is there method to "grep" classes:  $('.foo').click(function(){$('this') newclass=$(grep class foo*); $(li.newclass).addclass("active");}) ?
[07:50:08] <Brodingo> whuttt
[07:50:12] <Brodingo> are you trying to do
[07:50:13] <htoothrot> well fix your browser settings
[07:50:31] <harun> how?
[07:51:04] <htoothrot> google can help harun
[07:51:34] <qin> Brodingo: use one class to change class of element accordingly to navsomething class (or id) of trigerring elemant.
[07:51:37] <harun> I am trying but tell me what to do.
[07:52:25] <qin> Brodingo: In short: menu triggered by two sets of buttons. Just thinking how compact can it be.
[07:52:29] <Brodingo> still not very clear, maybe you need to pass event object and use event.target?
[07:55:03] <qin> Brodingo: thanks. look like this, neat!
[07:56:29] <Brodingo> mmmk
[07:59:35] <rns> anyone know why this isn't making my submit button work as a jqUI button? http://jsfiddle.net/BeqWR/
[08:05:36] <Narcissus> rns: cause your JS is in the CSS block?
[08:06:46] <rns> Narcissus, moved it to the JS block and it still isn't working... http://jsfiddle.net/BeqWR/1/
[08:06:53] <rns> Narcissus, any ideas?
[08:09:37] <qin> Brodingo: Yeah, this solved my broblem: http://goo.gl/tH8XR Still, thanks again for pushing me in right direction :)

[08:11:41] <Narcissus> rns: you are missing a jquery CSS file
[08:13:35] <t4nkd> Hi all, what is the selector syntax for "this elements parent's child #foo"
[08:14:14] <Brodingo> $(elem).parent().children('#foo')
[08:14:31] <Brodingo> or siblings i guess
[08:14:38] <t4nkd> oh true yeah
[08:14:52] <obsd123> I'm getting the source of an image as a response to a $.post() call - how can I display this in a div?
[08:16:07] <Brodingo> $('<img>', {src: 'blah.jpg'}).appendTo(elem)
[08:16:09] <Brodingo> or something
[08:17:07] <obsd123> Brodingo: by source I meant like the actual source of the .png file
[08:17:09] <obsd123> not a URI
[08:17:29] <Brodingo> que
[08:17:33] <obsd123> unless your response addressed that and I'm just missing the meaning of the code
[08:18:01] <t4nkd> Sorry one more selector question, how do I say "This elements nearest next sibling named .foo"
[08:18:37] <t4nkd> nearest next being pretty critical(I don't want to look backwards through the dom)
[08:18:45] <obsd123> Brodingo: well, if I were doing this at page-load I would put Content-Type: in the header and then just spit out all of the binary
[08:18:52] <obsd123> but I'm not sure how to do that after the fact
[08:18:54] <Engin> in load event handler of the img $(this).width() returns 0
[08:19:10] <Engin> attr('width') is ok though
[08:20:25] <Brodingo> might be problems with the event triggering if the img is in the cache engin?
[08:20:35] <Engin> maybe
[08:20:46] <Brodingo> attr('width') is just reading a value, not calculating like .width()
[08:20:59] <sphinxxx> anyone know any lightweight plugins to do this?
[08:20:59] <timmywil> Engin: .width is computed, will be 0 if not loaded yet, hidden, etc.
[08:21:11] <Engin> it is display:none, correct
[08:21:27] <Engin> attr('width') works on chrome and ff
[08:21:31] <Engin> no success in IE yet
[08:21:31] <timmywil> Engin: which version
[08:21:41] <Engin> latest
[08:22:07] <sphinxxx> i need to slideshow the background-image tag , while keeping the images full size to the screen
[08:22:16] <timmywil> Engin: .width should actually still give you a real width when hidden, unless the display: none is on a parent
[08:22:43] <t4nkd> Sorry one more selector question, how do I say "This elements nearest next sibling named .foo" -- sort've like $('#prev ~ .foo') but I only want the first returned match
[08:22:58] <tman> i have a situation where on mousenter i load/show some content of which some has a higher z-index than the element that triggers the event
[08:23:24] <tman> if the cursor happens to be in that space where the two overlap it gets stuck in a mouseenter/leave state, is there a way aroud this?
[08:23:37] <tman> stopPropagation?
[08:23:43] <Brodingo> t4nkd: maybe nextAll('.foo').eq(0)
[08:24:53] <juria_roberts> heyy why isnt this working
[08:24:59] <juria_roberts> a=selobj.value;
[08:25:01] <juria_roberts> 		$("#preview_page").contents().find('#links a').css('font-size',a);
[08:25:11] <juria_roberts> where selobj.value is a number like 14
[08:25:23] <timmywil> Engin: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/WdHhM/1/
[08:25:31] <juria_roberts> its working through firebug
[08:25:37] <tman> nm got it
[08:27:56] <timmywil> Engin: 1.6.2 has an update so that a style will be retrieved as a fallback tho: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/WdHhM/2/
[08:27:58] <juria_roberts> sorry my bad please ignore
[08:28:22] <timmywil> Engin: so if you can reproduce, I'd be interested to see it
[08:29:51] <Engin> http://jsfiddle.net/WdHhM/3/
[08:29:56] <Engin> this prints  0 0
[08:30:15] <Engin> http://jsfiddle.net/WdHhM/4/ this pritns the correct sizes
[08:30:25] <sukima> OMG jsfiddle has built in firebug-lite. That site is so awesome!!!!!!!
[08:30:38] <Engin> yet your last link returns 160 even though the imgs are display:none
[08:32:41] <timmywil> Engin: strange, what's different http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/WdHhM/5/
[08:33:10] <Engin> now 0 and undefined
[08:33:21] <Engin> s/each/load fixes .width()
[08:34:28] <knapper_tech> How to remove the 3rd list item in an unorderd list?
[08:34:32] <timmywil> Engin: it makes sense because the images need to load, but this is interesting because the fallback is only applied when display: none
[08:35:06] <tman> is doing $.mousemove(...) really hard on the compiler?
[08:35:17] <tman> ie, performance issues on slower machines?
[08:35:39] <Engin> mousemove is very aggressive, only process necessary invokes
[08:35:57] <tman> ok
[08:35:58] <Engin> i.e. if(oldx == x && oldy == y) return; oldx = x; oldy = y;
[08:36:40] <timmywil> Engin: oh nevermind, not consistently http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/WdHhM/8/
[08:36:44] <timmywil> will still do the fallback
[08:36:53] <Engin> or you could run your loging in a loop (setinterval) and use mousemove to just update current x,y, and process them in your loop as frequent as you want
[08:37:08] <Engin> s/loging/logic
[08:37:17] <knapper_tech> i need an nth item selector...guess i can just use an array reference
[08:37:27] <Engin> timmywil, something fishy going on, I'll check it when I sort out another regression
[08:37:36] <timmywil> Engin: so make sure you have a width set somewhere and you should at least get that fallback, but if you want the true computed width, do it on img load
[08:38:00] <Engin> timmywil, whole point of what I'm doing is to decide the dimensions of the image on runtime
[08:38:19] <timmywil> Engin: then it will need to be loaded or you can trust the given styles
[08:38:41] <Engin> of course, hence I'm trying to use .load and .width, which failed ofr some reason, I'll check
[08:39:19] <timmywil> Engin: ok, then that would be a bug if it can be reproduced
[08:44:54] <slartsa> sadmicrowave: to add to our previous conversation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2974241/how-do-i-get-outter-html-from-a-dynamically-created-checkbox-w-jquery I think that's useful

[09:03:56] <tman> how do your remove css('left').. $(..).css('left','') doesn't seem to work

[09:04:40] <Narcissus> rns: also, you have given an absolute link to the CSS file
[09:05:24] <rns> Narcissus, yes, but that code should work locally on my machine, right?

[09:31:33] <Acorn> Or is some event generated?
[09:35:19] <sphinxxx> anyone familiar with the supersized plugin?
[09:35:25] <laertiii> yeah me
[09:35:26] <Famic> hi
[09:35:30] <JEET> I have a image under div id myimage how can I change it's size by using .change
[09:35:36] <laertiii> sphinxxx  :   yah whats up
[09:35:46] <Famic> is it possible to select the text content of a td with a click event ?
[09:35:47] <sphinxxx> how does it insert images, on the body / html tag? or a div it creates ?
[09:36:05] <Famic> by select I mean for the user... blue zone and so on
[09:36:08] <sphinxxx> i've set it up on a page and the console is showing no errors, but images aren't showing
[09:36:12] <laertiii> it inserts the images inside the file bu location
[09:36:14] <JEET> div id creates it
[09:36:37] <laertiii> yeah
[09:36:47] <Engin> timmywil, btw, when you asked which version earlier, i thought about the browser versions
[09:36:59] <sphinxxx> file bu?
[09:37:12] <laertiii> files by location
[09:37:16] <Engin> I had 1.5.2 now I've switched to 1.6.2, the behaviour is changed... in chrome and ff, .load(.width()) was working, now they are undefined too :)
[09:37:22] <laertiii> u mean the supersized plugin
[09:37:25] <timmywil> Engin: ah, yea I meant jquery version
[09:37:36] <Engin> so basically, this means, that some guys application is broken if upgraded :)
[09:37:37] <laertiii> like testela.al
[09:37:51] <sphinxxx> laertiii:  would you mind taking a look
[09:38:16] <sphinxxx> https://opensky.com/p/template-slide
[09:39:02] <timmywil> Engin: undefined? don't think that's possible
[09:39:10] <timmywil> you mean 0
[09:39:13] <Engin> sorry, I had to dialogs opened, yes
[09:39:18] <Engin> attr('width') is undefined, width() is 0
[09:39:22] <laertiii> yeas the same that im using
[09:39:41] <timmywil> Engin: is it the parent that's hidden?
[09:39:47] <timmywil> or some parent
[09:40:25] <Engin> well up a few hierarchy it would be hidden
[09:40:32] <Engin> not the immediate parent though
[09:40:38] <Engin> it is a bit complex
[09:40:41] <timmywil> Engin: yea, then there's nothing jQuery can do
[09:40:51] <trumpetmic> haha
[09:41:13] <Engin> timmywil, can you re-summerize what's going on ?
[09:42:35] <Engin> timmywil, yup, it works on .click
[09:42:42] <timmywil> When elements are hidden, browsers always return 0 for computed dimensions.  jQuery can work around this by temporarily swapping display: none with display: block, visibility: hidden, position: absolute, but if a parent is hidden, jQuery will not go up the whole tree (would be quite expensive)
[09:43:03] <timmywil> however, if still 0, jQuery will fall back to retrieving uncomputed styles instead
[09:43:10] <Engin> ok
[09:43:17] <juria_roberts> pleas ehelp me some1
[09:43:21] <timmywil> so if you set width/height, you'll still get a number
[09:43:48] <Engin> I doubt how expensive it would be... not the DOM manipulation I think but rendering could be costly and could cause some visual artifacts
[09:44:03] <imsky> yawn!
[09:44:17] <Engin> if I set it, I wouldn't need all these anyway
[09:44:18] <ericincoldohio> I have a page with $.ajax calls...anyone know of a good tutorial I can read on how to get an animation in the middle of the page?
[09:44:18] <Engin> :)
[09:44:35] <ericincoldohio> an animation during the ajax call
[09:45:11] <timmywil> Engin: on a side note, it's recommended for page speed to have width/height set on all your image tags so browsers don't need to compute it when rendering
[09:45:14] <juria_roberts> please help me im running out of time
[09:45:29] <Assimilater> lol, here i was making a quick fiddle to try and illustrate my question and it doesn't even work, it thinks the function getNums is not defined, so before i ask for help with my problem, can someone help me figure out what the deal is with jsfiddle on this? http://jsfiddle.net/ZEPVu/
[09:45:44] <Swimming_bird> clearQueue() doesn't seem to work on slideUp/slideDown
[09:46:22] <Engin> timmywil, sure ? they'd compute it no matter what I think. Though setting width/height would keep the page intact while loading ... instead of new loaded images pushing stuff around
[09:47:35] <timmywil> Engin: browsers will skip it if set in styles (think of when you set it to something different than the actual dimensions, browsers will just use that and you'll see a scewed image)
[09:48:24] <anavel> hai
[09:48:52] <anavel> is there a way to select elemeny by using its name attribute ? beside using id and class.

[09:50:19] <juria_roberts> sorry how do i make a global
[09:50:27] <juria_roberts> so that its there in the second function
[09:52:12] <anavel> got it. you can use $('foo[name=bar]');
[09:52:47] <juria_roberts> anybody?
[09:53:03] <rns> anyone know why this styling would disapear when I reload my form via ajax?  http://fpaste.org/xjdD/

[09:54:39] <SoulRaven> hi
[09:54:57] <juria_roberts> timmywil: will u get the value of textdecoration in the second function
[09:55:03] <SoulRaven> if i want to count how many check boxes i have selected, how i do that?
[09:55:09] <timmywil> juria_roberts: you can do that
[09:55:33] <ericincoldohio> http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[09:55:34] <timmywil> juria_roberts: oh, i misunderstood, yes
[09:55:44] <juria_roberts> but in my code im not getting a when i should be getting it
[09:56:12] <timmywil> juria_roberts: need to define a outside the scope of the hover functions
[09:56:29] <juria_roberts> ohh ill try
[09:56:54] <timmywil> juria_roberts: to have an 'a' for each element, bind the hover inside an each and define 'a' just above the bind
[09:58:03] <juria_roberts> i just added var a above the code i pasted
[09:58:15] <juria_roberts> timmywil: but its telling me a is undefined
[09:58:34] <timmywil> juria_roberts: it will be undefined the first time until you set it
[09:58:36] <juria_roberts> timmywil: wait
[09:58:46] <juria_roberts> i might hav made a mistake
[09:59:14] <SoulRaven> ericincoldohio: i want to count how many check box i have selected, the value of each i manage to get from them, but i don't know how to get selected object

[10:02:10] <amsl> Sorry about the spam ^
[10:02:38] <ryanneufeld> GeO`: you would probably need to bind to mouseenter

[10:02:59] <ryanneufeld> and watch the co-ordinates of the mouse in relation to the box
[10:03:37] <GeO`> yes, and adjust the left css attribute in function. I could write it but I'm not very good, doesn't it already exist ?

[10:11:12] <ciss> hi, i'm trying to fetch a html page with $.get() and parse it for certain elements. but when using $(data), all i get is a bunch of Comment objects, text nodes etc) that can't be traversed with find(). i've read about a solution using native XML Dom, and i could also think of using a hidden iframe. is there a third option? (maybe i'm missing something)
[10:14:02] <Jayflux> ciss whats the link you're trying to get
[10:14:45] <ciss> Jayflux: http://www.dimdi.de/static/de/klassi/diagnosen/icd10/htmlgm2011/block-a15-a19.htm
[10:14:48] <Jayflux> and make sure your dataType is html
[10:15:06] <Jayflux> you on the same server
[10:15:07] <ciss> Jayflux: there's a parent page from which i try to parse sub pages using a bookmarklet i'm writing
[10:15:09] <ryanneufeld> ciss: is the page you're after on the same domain?
[10:15:17] <ciss> ryanneufeld: yep
[10:15:29] <ciss> dataType might be a good hint ...
[10:15:39] <c0m> http://pastebin.com/tyVUDC21 .. when a select option changes, if the selected option is "Hour" then it goes into that conditional .... i successfully get it to alert but changing the parameters of the binded object doesn't work .... basically, datetimepicker is an extension of datepicker.... by default, i show the datetimepicker without a time slider ... if the selected option is Hour, I want to show the time sliders ... but it doesn't wo
[10:15:42] <c0m> any idea why?
[10:15:54] <Jayflux> dataType should be html
[10:16:40] <ciss> i'd assume that the "intelligent guess" mentioned in the docs automatically chooses html, but i'll give it a try
[10:17:18] <Jayflux> plus ciss why are you doing $(data)
[10:18:01] <ciss> Jayflux: because i'm trying to extract data from the page loaded via get()
[10:18:20] <Jayflux> you have a link
[10:19:01] <ciss> specifically i tried something like $(data).find('h4').each(...)
[10:19:29] <Jayflux> but data is the page you requested, not a selector?
[10:20:57] <Jayflux> you tried it in every browser
[10:21:28] <ciss> data is the value passed to the success callback by get(), therefore a string containing the raw html (including the doctype)
[10:22:02] <ciss> i tried to turn it into a jquery object so that i might use jquerys traverse functions on it
[10:22:22] <Jayflux> you got a link where you're doing this
[10:22:34] <c0m> i tried unbinding but it didn't work either
[10:23:11] <KanKouni> anyone around good with dran & drop ?
[10:23:47] <Jayflux> ciss try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3052503/jquery-traversing-ajax-response-in-chrome-safari
[10:24:11] <Jayflux> and tell me if it works
[10:24:57] <DukeDrake> hi
[10:25:04] <g0bl1n> I want to cache resources that must be called via 'jsonp' ajax calls, using conditional GET's. Naming a differente name to the callback will always add up the jQuery=231231231_12312312 string. The resource is read-only. Any hints ?
[10:25:21] <DukeDrake> is there something like jquery engine for serverside DOM-analysis?
[10:25:26] <ciss> Jayflux: this looks really helpful, thanks! will do :)
[10:25:37] <Jayflux> ciss no worries, let me know if it works for you :)
[10:25:42] <g0bl1n> myCallBackForThis=jQuery1312312_12312312
[10:26:01] <g0bl1n> any way to reset the value ?
[10:26:31] <g0bl1n> Does jsonp ajax calls need a different stamp for each request ?

[10:47:11] <jstout> i'm trying to bind an event to clicking on an element within an iframe
[10:47:29] <jstout> a simple, $('iframe').click(fn()...); isn't working.
[10:49:38] <rewt> put the js in the iframe
[10:51:16] <Gienio> hi
[10:51:36] <jstout> i'm using an advertising platform that changes ads in an iframe
[10:51:53] <jstout> but my code before had an onclick event on the image that would change the contents of the div
[10:51:58] <jstout> now i can't do the same functionality
[10:52:46] <Gienio> i'm looking for the best solution of that example: http://jsfiddle.net/JZujK/
[10:53:14] <Gienio> do u have any idea how to do that? ;)
[10:53:37] <Gienio> of course i have a solution, but it's damn ugly, I can post it too
[10:53:47] <Gienio> but i dont want to suggest a way to solve this
[10:54:37] <miwillhite> hey all - I'm working with jQuery's param fn
[10:54:57] <miwillhite> doing something like this: $.param({ site: [{1: 'PV0300BADE1110100213'}, {2: 'PV0300BADE1110100213'}] })
[10:55:18] <miwillhite> which gives me the equiv of this: site[0][1]=PV0300BADE1110100213&site[1][2]=PV0300BADE1110100213
[10:55:33] <miwillhite> but I actually want this: site[][1]=PV0300BADE1110100213&site[][2]=PV0300BADE1110100213
[10:55:52] <miwillhite> can I form my original object differently, or do something to get rid of those array indices?
[11:00:32] <poindontcare> question if i wanted to attach some data to a link so that i can use it in a click handler what attribute should i use
[11:00:52] <miwillhite> poindontcare, data-* attributes
[11:01:14] <miwillhite> but I wouldn't recommend placing data in the dom if you can help it
[11:01:39] <poindontcare> data-* are this in html syntax ?
[11:01:49] <Gienio> html5 yup
[11:01:59] <poindontcare> miloj:  how would you do it if you have many links and wanted to have link relative data ?
[11:02:16] <poindontcare> Gienio: really, hmm  interesting
[11:02:51] <poindontcare> oops miwillhite
[11:03:40] <miwillhite> poindontcare: depends on how you are setting up your app, typically you want to handle that kind of stuff unobtrusively
[11:04:18] <miwillhite> with the data-* attrs you can do things like data-serial-number="123"
[11:04:35] <poindontcare> basically it is a grid of thumbnails which need to play a video from an offset
[11:04:44] <poindontcare> of the thumbnail
[11:04:49] <miwillhite> then it if you are using jquery 1.6 it will be available in the data() object i.e. $('.link').data()
[11:05:34] <poindontcare> ah am using 1.4 but data might be the best way for now
[11:06:01] <miwillhite> yep
[11:06:42] <Gienio> attr() will also work with data-*
[11:07:10] <poindontcare> Gienio:  yup , lets try it
[11:08:57] <poindontcare> any one know of good quick time player skins
[11:09:30] <miwillhite> hold onâ€¦let me go back 10 yearsâ€¦
[11:09:34] <miwillhite> :P
[11:09:54] <poindontcare> :) , what do the cool kids do h.264 ?
[11:12:25] <gnrlbzik> hey guys
[11:12:40] <gnrlbzik> i need help with ui component
[11:12:51] <gnrlbzik> more specific with autocomplete
[11:13:02] <gnrlbzik> any one want to land me a hand?
[11:13:19] <Patabugen> Don't ask to ask gnrl, just ask ;)
[11:13:31] <gnrlbzik> alright UI autocomplete
[11:14:04] <Patabugen> When I use UI tabs with Ajax it creates hash's for me such as #ui-tabs-3. Does anyone know whether I can give these my own names? (e.g to be able to link to them reliably)
[11:14:04] <gnrlbzik> has minLength
[11:14:16] <gnrlbzik> option
[11:14:39] <gnrlbzik> if set to 0 it displays entire list of results
[11:14:42] <gnrlbzik> rightaway
[11:15:04] <Patabugen> Why would you want it at 0 and not at 1?
[11:15:12] <gnrlbzik> but it starts to filter from that character
[11:15:20] <gnrlbzik> so it would show me entire list of results first
[11:15:40] <Patabugen> Ah ok
[11:15:45] <gnrlbzik> filtering needs to start at 2 characters
[11:15:55] <gnrlbzik> but i need to show the full list right away
[11:16:03] <Patabugen> Ah
[11:16:10] <gnrlbzik> and i cant come up with solution
[11:16:15] <janthony> I'm doing an ajax request, where it prepends the data returned from the ajax request to the dom. My question is, how would I set a var to the data that elements that were just set to the dom? Basically once the data is set to the dom I want to modify some elements in it.
[11:16:23] <Patabugen> I did that somewhere, I did something like (from memory, and it's been a while...)
[11:16:53] <Patabugen> $('#autocomplete').autocomplete({minLength: 0}).autocmplete('').autocomplete('option', 'minLength', '2');
[11:17:08] <Patabugen> I can't remember what it actually was, but I set it to 0, triggered a search, then set the option to 2
[11:17:23] <gnrlbzik> let me try
[11:17:43] <wpsmith> Can someone help me with a simple jquery issue: http://jsfiddle.net/rN2Gu/?
[11:17:45] <Patabugen> janthony Can you not use regular selectors once your ajax is done?
[11:18:08] <gnrlbzik> yeah, if its part of the dom
[11:18:21] <gnrlbzik> you should be able to use a selector to search through
[11:18:33] <janthony> Patabugen: No, because the data is prepending has class selectors that are already used on the dom, so it wouldn't select that specific entry, it would select all the ones that are already on the page before the ajax request + the one that was just prepended.
[11:18:43] <wpsmith> basically I have 5 rows and I want the last 4 to appear only when a person selects true in the selection in row 1 -> http://jsfiddle.net/rN2Gu/
[11:19:39] <Patabugen> Ah, when I do that I tend to add an 'initilized' attribute to avoid re-init'ing something
[11:19:58] <Patabugen> Or you could add an initilized class, and filter that from your selector
[11:20:28] <gnrlbzik> why cant you manipulate it, before you prepand
[11:20:30] <gnrlbzik> or append
[11:20:32] <janthony> Patabugen: You gave me an idea though. I might add an id to the prepended dom element + all the other elements and return the id back with my data from the ajax request and use that for my selector.
[11:22:02] <jonathansampson> I think I might have come across a bug in jQueryUI. I've made a text case at http://jsbin.com/ikukav/2/ if anybody has a moment to test.
[11:22:18] <gnrlbzik> Patabugen
[11:22:21] <gnrlbzik> did not work
[11:22:30] <gnrlbzik> it resets that option
[11:22:55] <gnrlbzik> actually
[11:22:58] <gnrlbzik> never mind
[11:23:08] <gnrlbzik> i should do this on click
[11:23:09] <gnrlbzik>  ; )
[11:24:44] <Patabugen> wpsmith you have several issues in there
[11:25:04] <Patabugen> You're missing the . on the class selector mainSelector
[11:26:15] <gnrlbzik> it kind of works
[11:26:18] <gnrlbzik> Patabugen
[11:26:33] <gnrlbzik> it does display the list on first click
[11:26:43] <wpsmith> Patabugen, ok fixed that
[11:26:47] <gnrlbzik> and as soona s you start typing
[11:26:54] <gnrlbzik> it hides list
[11:27:09] <Patabugen> It should hide it but filter it?
[11:27:09] <wpsmith> Patabugen, I prob have lots of errors. 2nd time dealing with JS and JQuery
[11:27:33] <gnrlbzik> and displays only if i reach two characters and if they actually match
[11:27:38] <detrate> has anyone had trouble writing jQuery in the console with firebug in firefox 5?
[11:27:41] <Patabugen> Ah
[11:27:45] <detrate> it seems to not return anything for me
[11:28:04] <Patabugen> I've not updated to 5 yet, 'fraid.
[11:28:15] <detrate> honestly, probably not worth it yet
[11:28:18] <Patabugen> haha
[11:28:25] <detrate> only major difference is animation support
[11:28:30] <Patabugen> I wish I could say "Don't update till my addons are updated" and stop asking me all the time
[11:28:53] <Patabugen> I gather their plan is to have largly meaningless version numbers from now, in the path of Chrome who are already on 12
[11:28:56] <detrate> but firebug feels more broken
[11:28:58] <detrate> and firebug rebroke my CSS overrides
[11:29:00] <detrate> yeah
[11:29:05] <detrate> which makes sense from a marketing standpoint
[11:29:09] <detrate> but it's annoying as a technical person
[11:29:11] <Patabugen> No more getting excited for us :(
[11:29:26] <detrate> well, firefox 4 took WAAAAAAAAAAAAY to long to get out the door
[11:29:27] <Patabugen> I guess the idea is to say you're either up to date or your not, so go update
[11:29:30] <detrate> and for what? PERSONAS?
[11:29:38] <Patabugen> haha
[11:29:49] <c0m> is it possible to unbind something and then rebind it with the same thing again?
[11:29:50] <detrate> I love firefox but dammit mozilla..
[11:29:50] <gnrlbzik> Patabugen: the scenario is, if i focusin or click on the field, while it focused, result list should show, on 3nd character it should start filtering
[11:29:58] <detrate> c0m: yes
[11:30:07] <c0m> why does this fail then?
[11:30:31] <gnrlbzik> 2nd*
[11:30:32] <Patabugen> You might need to be a bit more smart then gnr, and use a keyPress bind and say if it's < 3 show everything, otherwise filter
[11:30:50] <Patabugen> (your code more smart, I mean :) )
[11:31:00] <gnrlbzik> : )
[11:31:03] <smali> has anyone here worked with this plugin http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/? how can i pass the multiselect in php?
[11:31:06] <c0m> http://pastebin.com/Nbu1F4kb
[11:31:10] <c0m> that fails detrate
[11:31:16] <gnrlbzik> well i already listen to those for no results window for example
[11:31:28] <c0m> first datetimepicker call gets binded correctly, second time, nothing
[11:31:39] <wpsmith> Patabugen any more pointers on my issue plz? http://jsfiddle.net/rN2Gu/
[11:31:42] <blindMoe> smali: just have php print out the javascript options for the plugin
[11:31:46] <gnrlbzik> but how can i triger result list with out search?
[11:31:47] <detrate> btw c0m are you familiar with .live() ?
[11:32:01] <c0m> what about it?
[11:32:20] <detrate> it might stop you from dealing with unbinding and rebinding
[11:32:46] <smali> blindMoe so do it but my problem is how do i know what has been selected i tried with name='moo[]' but php doesn't read that one in post it reads [multiselect_0] => 19
[11:33:40] <c0m> let me recheck live()
[11:34:41] <gnrlbzik> Patabugen any ideas?
[11:35:12] <Patabugen> gnrlbzik: You might need to be a bit more smart then gnr, and use a keyPress bind and say if it's < 3 show everything, otherwise filter
[11:35:14] <Patabugen> gnrlbzik: (your code more smart, I mean :) )
[11:37:32] <smali> blindMoe any ideas?
[11:37:55] <janthony> I'm having trouble with a selector. I know you can do this with inputs, but not sure about selects, It's giving me an error in console: $("select[name='header_category']")
[11:37:55] <wpsmith> any help for my simple jquery issue? http://jsfiddle.net/rN2Gu/
[11:38:36] <Patabugen> wpsmith you'd do well to explain what the issue is, also
[11:39:25] <muzone_> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?01l&raw - is there a way to prevent border-radius from affecting the inside of my slider handles?
[11:39:30] <gnrlbzik> thnks Patabugen, i understand now what you meant, so on keypress, manually provide search term
[11:39:37] <muzone_> (jQuery UI Slider)
[11:39:57] <gnrlbzik> which in term is pulled from .val()
[11:40:54] <gnrlbzik> its weird, why could they just have an option to display result list all the time
[11:40:55] <wpsmith> Patabugen, basically I have 5 rows and I want the last 4 to appear only when a person selects true in the selection in row 1 -> http://jsfiddle.net/rN2Gu/
[11:41:01] <gnrlbzik> don't understand
[11:41:13] <gnrlbzik> probably need to fork the plugin
[11:41:14] <wpsmith> Patabugen, other than my feeble attempt at JS and jQ, I don't know the problem
[11:41:26] <gnrlbzik> and add these changes to plugin it self, for future use
[11:41:37] <gnrlbzik> widget i mean*
[11:42:20] <blindMoe> wpsmith: change $("mainSelector select")  to:  $(".mainSelector select")
[11:42:35] <wpsmith> blindMoe did that
[11:42:56] <blindMoe> wpsmith: http://jsfiddle.net/rN2Gu/6/
[11:43:27] <blindMoe> you didn't have jsfiddle set to use jquery and you also don't need to specify the jQuery(document).ready in jsfiddle
[11:43:47] <janthony> Anyone?
[11:44:00] <wpsmith> blindMoe, perfect
[11:44:05] <wpsmith> I see what I did wrong
[11:44:07] <wpsmith> thanks!
[11:45:04] <janthony> Is there not a selector for select elements?
[11:45:15] <muzone_> *AIRHOOOOORN*
[11:45:18] <muzone_> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?01l&raw - is there a way to prevent border-radius from affecting the inside of my slider handles?
[11:46:25] * blindMoe is outta here.. enjoy the weekend everyone
[11:46:34] <NielsAway> is this also the right please to ask question about jqueryUI ?
[11:47:08] <sphinxxx> anyone know why this supersized plugin isn't loading images? stuck on loader gif : https://opensky.com/p/template-slide
[11:47:17] <muzone_> NielsAway: ask away
[11:47:24] <NielsAway> Perfect
[11:48:09] <gnrlbzik> Thanks Patabugen, for putting me on the right path.
[11:48:23] <NielsAway> Al from a long time i'm trying to understand the position thing. But i cant understand what happens in the demo.
[11:48:39] <smali> can no one help me with my problem?
[11:48:41] <NielsAway> does someone use it and can tell me how to use it myself?
[11:48:51] <gnrlbzik> whats the problem
[11:49:10] <smali> as anyone here worked with this plugin http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/? how can i pass the multiselect in php?
[11:49:37] <c0m> just get the values as you normally gets them in php
[11:49:50] <c0m> submit the form and do a print_r($_POST)
[11:49:56] <c0m> look at the values you get
[11:49:58] <c0m> done
[11:49:59] <smali> but that doesn't work all i get in the post is [multiselect_0] => 27
[11:50:12] <smali> even when i use name with []
[11:50:45] <c0m> it seems the js is only changing the presentation of it to the user
[11:50:55] <c0m> thought i haven't examined it
[11:50:59] <c0m> *though
[11:51:45] <smali> there is a function to get all selected values on the website called Retrieve an array of all selected values?
[11:51:55] <c0m> don't know, not familiar
[11:51:57] <c0m> sorry
[11:52:03] <smali> np thanks anyways
[11:53:25] <NielsAway> Noone using the Position Utility?
[11:54:25] <NielsMob> >>http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/#default
[11:54:53] <ajpiano> NielsMob: what is your query
[11:56:04] <NielsMob> I just played with the demo but when i move one of the blocks all block move away from the screen. Not sure of that is intended etc.
[11:56:37] <ajpiano> the demo has its quirks - you should just pull it into your project and attempt to use it for what you need it for
[11:56:37] <SkyFlyer> problem. I'm doing a .load of one page into another div. But if I click on the link to load the page, the inside page that gets loaded only runs the document ready sometimes.  anyone experience this?  If I click on the link 3 times, it finally will run the document ready for the loaded page?
[11:57:39] <NielsMob> ajpiano: Yeah right but before i can use it i need to understand how it works ;) and it is not clear at all atm.
[11:57:46] <ajpiano> NielsMob: it's a sentence
[11:58:06] <ajpiano> put some aspect of one element at another aspect of another element
[11:58:30] <ajpiano> $("#foo").position({my: "left top", at:"left bottom", of: $("#bar")});
[12:00:01] <NielsMob> ajpiano: what i want to do is making a seat  chart and give them a position and allow the admin to drag (blocks) of seats etc. is that possible with this?
[12:00:27] <ajpiano> it could be part of a solution for that, i suppose
[12:00:52] <SkyFlyer> anyone know why a document ready would only work half the time?  or after 3 reloads ?
[12:01:24] <ajpiano> SkyFlyer, loading scripts that are embeded inside of html that you're loading via ajax is a recipe for sadness
[12:01:47] <Patabugen> Why is it so bad ajpiano?
[12:01:58] <ajpiano> it's just mad ugly
[12:02:12] <ajpiano> from an organization standpoint, for one thing
[12:02:43] <ajpiano> your code is just distributed all around different html snippets, instead of your application JS being in control of the app
[12:02:43] <Patabugen> Ah fair enough, I quite like it (grouping the HTML with the JS which works on it). I was wondering whether there was a technical/security/etc issue too
[12:03:08] <ajpiano> also like, there is so much JS in projects that doesn't work on any HTML, per se
[12:03:53] <SkyFlyer> yeah, not sure
[12:06:04] <Engina> ie9 is definetely a step forward but still like shit
[12:06:57] <ajpiano> SkyFlyer are you using .load("url") or .load("url #filterwithselector");
[12:07:31] <NielsMob> ajpiano: are you willing to make a small working thing using the position utility? it will help me understand what is possible with it?
[12:07:56] <muzone_> At my jQuery UI Slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01m&raw - how do I make my price ranges float just above my slider handles like at http://tinyurl.com/6az2shw ?
[12:09:09] <threexk> hello.  When I try to change a text input's text in a blur event handler, it doesn't seem to take effect in Chrome.  Why?
[12:09:46] <ajpiano> NielsMob, do you have some html and css and stuff that shows the static content that you'd need positioned
[12:09:56] <thejh> question: How can I create a bunch of same-looking, non-modal dialogs? should be usable for something like "open a new instance of this dialog when the user clicks on 'inspect'"
[12:10:01] <ajpiano> NielsMob, position isn't for dragging and dropping btw, just for programatically moving elements on the page
[12:11:11] <thejh> threexk, could you paste the relevant part of your code on jsfiddle?
[12:11:45] <ajpiano> thejh, by creating some code that creates divs that have CSS on them?
[12:12:02] <Engina> when i give single attr('width', x); to an image, IE9 puts the height attribute of the original image, hence it does not keep aspect ratio
[12:12:08] <Engina> how could this happen
[12:12:13] <jedimind> ajpiano, thats like black magic!
[12:12:16] <NielsMob> ajpiano: no i have noting yet. i was just playing with the dragging Interaction etc.
[12:12:31] <thejh> ajpiano, ok, was just wondering about whether there's a better way to do it
[12:17:19] <NielsMob> ajpiano:  and was also looking at the position utility off course ;)
[12:19:17] <threexk> thejh: http://jsfiddle.net/WL7RN/
[12:20:09] <threexk> thejh: err, http://jsfiddle.net/WL7RN/1/

[12:24:11] <muzone_> At my jQuery UI Slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01m&raw - how do I make my price ranges float just above my slider handles like at http://tinyurl.com/6az2shw ?
[12:26:23] <ajpiano> muzone_: use the slide callback to position the amount div above the corresponding slider element, you can get references to the slider handles by inspecting the slider instance, availble via $("#elem").data("slider")
[12:27:15] <sphinxxx> i can't find the syntax error here:
[12:27:19] <sphinxxx> no errors in console
[12:27:21] <ajpiano> and use the position utility to say like $("#amount1").position({my: "center bottom", at: "center top", of : aReferenceToASliderHandle});
[12:27:22] <sphinxxx> http://jsfiddle.net/NTypN/
[12:27:46] <ajpiano> the syntax error is that you have put <script> tags etc, inside of the javascript pane
[12:27:50] <ajpiano> which is only supposed to contain javascript
[12:27:52] <ajpiano> not html etc
[12:28:23] <muzone_> ajpiano: thanks a lot man
[12:28:27] <sphinxxx> its just to show it
[12:32:38] <ajpiano> sphinxxx: it looks like something about that email regex is dodgy

[12:33:48] <ajpiano> $("#foo").css({height: 1500, width: 2000});
[12:33:52] <mythmon> is there any way to get progress with a $.ajax() call? I would like to make a progress bar.
[12:33:58] <mts7> I have a page that uses jQuery UI Tabs for display, and it works well.  I am now trying to include jsTree in one tab, but the tabs take over the tree.  Any
[12:33:58] <mts7> ideas?
[12:34:03] <ajpiano> mythmon: no
[12:34:22] <innociv> eval
[12:34:22] <innociv> .
[12:34:39] <innociv> >[ I always forget these commands
[12:34:40] <mythmon> is it hard to get progress bars on ajax downloads?
[12:34:59] <ajpiano> mythmon, no, typically you need another polling loop to check the progress on the server
[12:35:32] <mythmon> ajpiano: i see. i will just do a "in progress" indicator, without progress.
[12:35:40] <ajpiano> ya, fo real

[12:35:50] <mod> Hey all, I'm trying to fix a problem with event propagation in IE.  I've got 3 layered divs a z-index of 1, 100 and 200.  While I have a listener on 200, the event is ignored by 200, seems hit 100 first and deadpan right there
[12:35:51] <JEET> thanks ajpiano
[12:35:54] <trend> http://digitarald.de/project/fancyupload/ will give you some info on how to get this done
[12:36:19] <mod> i've been reading about IE's event bubbling, but I haven't found out what I need to actually to do get the end to move on to the layer I want

[12:38:00] <RTPMatt> are there any known issues with data-link and 1.6.2?
[12:38:34] <mts7> Has anyone successfully used jstree inside a jquery ui tab?
[12:39:07] <sphinxxx> anyone know why an easing js file would block  scripts coming after, form running?
[12:42:09] <muzone_> ajpiano: one more thing about topshop.com's slider - notice how the highest and lowest price tends to go to the far left / right whenever necessary? how is this achieved?
[12:42:34] <ajpiano> by having fashionable clothes at reasonable prices
[12:42:39] <muzone_> heheh
[12:42:44] <ajpiano> increasing the consumer's threshold for upward movement on particular products?
[12:42:52] <ajpiano> i donno, i didn't even noticed that
[12:43:04] <ajpiano> they aren't using jqui slider
[12:43:11] <muzone_> me neither it just occured to me - kinda cool though
[12:43:21] <muzone_> yeah thats true
[12:43:51] <ajpiano> ui slider has range and max and min options etc, could be useful
[12:44:53] <muzone_> interesting stuff
[12:45:00] <muzone_> ill play around with that some
[12:45:50] <b-lew> any reason why mouseout doesn't work with this? http://pastie.org/2151527
[12:46:14] <NielsMob> ajpiano: i just copied the position demo to jsfiddle and now it is working as i expected it to work. Why is it not working on the demo site?
[12:46:36] <smali> does anyone here know an alternative jquery mutliselect plugin to this http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[12:47:33] <ajpiano> not sure NielsMob, could actually be cause of the iframe on the demos site or something, i can try to get someone to look at it
[12:47:57] <t4nkd> Is there a function similar to append that takes the contents of a div and duplicates it, rather than simply appending the entire div to a target?
[12:48:36] <t4nkd> Probably .clone()
[12:48:37] <t4nkd> :P
[12:49:03] <mts7> any jstree users here?
[12:49:22] <ajpiano> smali: there is this http://quasipartikel.at/multiselect/
[12:49:28] <NielsMob> ajpiano: thanks ;)
[12:49:48] <NielsMob> It makes now much more sense ;)
[12:50:07] <smali> ajpiano thanks i'll give it a try
[12:50:50] <segore> can i ask question about jquerytool in this channel? if yes, i have a problem with the tooltip-plugin. i'am using a simple line of code "$("img[title]").tooltip();" .. but i don't see the title in firefox 4.0.1/5, but in ie/chrome it works ... what could be the problem? even if I disable css i don't see them on mouseover
[12:51:28] <NielsMob> ajpiano: The only thing i still not understand is what the collision option does, after reading the information ;)
[12:52:06] <ajpiano> i think it's broken, that option
[12:52:24] <muzone_> ajpiano: maybe there's also a way to increase the selection area of the sliders? its kinda hard hitting them precisely when they're just 2px wide and some users might find that annoying
[12:52:35] <NielsMob> ajpiano: check
[12:53:12] <ajpiano> muzone_: don't have small targets - it's just not a good paradigm :)
[12:53:50] <muzone_> i fully agree:-)
[12:55:20] <NielsMob> ajpiano: when i create 1000+ elements with position etc. do you think it is still loading fast enough?
[12:55:48] <knapper_tech> dear god....  why do comparisons against members of an object fail?
[12:56:27] <grey-monkey> I need to call and API from jquery. It's not allowing me I think b/c of cross-site scripting. How do I get around this issue?
[12:57:42] <knapper_tech> http://jsfiddle.net/FKDPB/
[12:57:43] <knapper_tech> lol
[12:58:19] <knapper_tech> there's a GET for other domains
[12:58:24] <knapper_tech> not the regular GET
[12:58:31] <knapper_tech> or POST...honestly can't remember
[12:58:39] <knapper_tech> but look in the jQ ajax methods list
[12:58:41] <b-lew> Can I score some help? $('div#featured div)').bind('mouseout',CSP.collapseAll); -> I have a function that basically i want it to collaspe all when i mouse out but for somereaon it isn't working. Can I score some help?
[12:58:57] <knapper_tech> someone fix my comparison.  i'm dying on this thing
[13:00:31] <knapper_tech> ima try somethine else
[13:00:34] <unclemantis> how do i get DatePicker to use UTC time instead of the user's local time?
[13:03:13] <grey-monkey> knapper_tech: seems to work for me http://jsfiddle.net/FKDPB/1/
[13:04:07] <t4nkd> Is there a good resource/tutorial for expandable content boxes in a grid? Like, they are are in a "small" state, if I click one it becomes "big" -- I can then toggle that element or, click another which causes the previous active element to shrink?
[13:04:20] <t4nkd> s/are are/are all/
[13:07:17] <knapper_tech> grey-monkey:   lol... this is not being cool on a friday afternoon
[13:08:41] <knapper_tech> grey-monkey:  did you change anything?
[13:08:57] <grey-monkey> nope.
[13:09:23] <grey-monkey> I know what you mean; today is killing me :-)
[13:13:59] <lunability> Hey Zoe! :D
[13:16:55] <Grega> Does anyone have experience with plupload? I have a bit customized plupload.flash.js so that it adds thumbnails in File(), but I'm getting an error saying file.thumb_data is undefined, although I can access it using firebug. http://wp.ruf.si/plupload/thumbnails/index2.html . Any ideas?
[13:17:16] <Zoe> Oh, hi Luna :D
[13:21:09] <devinrolsen> Hey everyone, little confused about the jquery validation plugin still. http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/ shows an example of signup form, but there is no quotes around the validation rule's name attribute selectors.
[13:21:20] <devinrolsen> yet if I do that, my script freaks out.
[13:21:31] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: paste your code
[13:21:33] <ryanneufeld> I'll take a look
[13:21:41] <ryanneufeld> I've used that plugin a fair bit
[13:23:30] <devinrolsen> http://pastebin.com/es4LyG0D
[13:24:01] <devinrolsen> ryanneufeld, say 'data[User][first_name]' equals my fields name attribute.
[13:24:14] <ryanneufeld> That has to be quoted
[13:24:34] <ryanneufeld> [] are not valid characters in a object identifier
[13:24:35] <devinrolsen> ok... but how does that example get away with our quoting them?
[13:24:45] <devinrolsen> out*
[13:24:52] <devinrolsen> they too are using the name attributes.
[13:25:13] * ryanneufeld looks
[13:25:34] <devinrolsen> the whole reason I bring this up is cause that script I tossed you works great in all browsers except IE8 and IE7.
[13:25:56] <devinrolsen> so I was just trying to compare and contrast against examples.
[13:25:57] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: none of the ones in the example you sent me have [] in any of the object attribute identifiers
[13:26:21] <devinrolsen> ohh
[13:26:24] <ryanneufeld> :)
[13:26:25] <devinrolsen> I see what you mean
[13:26:40] <ryanneufeld> unquoted [] in js means array index
[13:26:47] <devinrolsen> ok, but still with them quoted (to escape funny chars like that), it fails in IE.
[13:26:52] <Gienio> http://jsfiddle.net/N2ej8/ can u do that better?
[13:26:56] <devinrolsen> and I have tried to switch to using ids instead.
[13:26:59] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[13:27:02] <ryanneufeld> lemme look again
[13:27:03] <devinrolsen> but broke everything.
[13:27:14] <jY> i have a $('textarea.comment_entry').autoResize({}); in my code.. now I also have new textareas being loaded via ajax.. is there a way to bind those to the .autoResize?
[13:27:15] <devinrolsen> thanks you so much for looking ryanneufeld.
[13:27:36] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: where is your markup?
[13:28:12] <devinrolsen> well I could put something in jsfiddle, but jsfiddle and the validation plugin hate each other lol
[13:28:22] <ryanneufeld> oh
[13:28:26] <ryanneufeld> just the markup is fine
[13:28:42] <ryanneufeld> I just want to see if there is another way to accomplish the skinning of this cat
[13:29:00] <devinrolsen> k one moment (I just realized an actual page for others to see my issue might be a good idea.)
[13:29:09] <ryanneufeld> yup
[13:32:40] <t4nkd> Is there a way to use console.log on a property of a function?
[13:32:52] <devinrolsen> ryanneufeld - http://pastebin.com/pvYPiJA8
[13:33:02] <devinrolsen> sorry was trying to clear out all the meaningless copy for ya.
[13:33:30] <devinrolsen> let me get a working (but still failing) version online real quick.
[13:33:43] <devinrolsen> tell me if anything stands out that might be break it if you could.
[13:38:55] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: looking
[13:40:32] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: Is there a reason you're putting it all into arrays in the form
[13:40:43] <ryanneufeld> each field is unique, it's not really neccessary
[13:40:51] <k_89> Hi, i am getting a 500 internal server error in all my $.ajax calls of type post with some data for a specific site on my local server, and this is happening only on this site, rest all are functioning properly, has anyone encountered this issue before
[13:41:00] <devinrolsen> server side people did that m8
[13:41:05] <devinrolsen> I know it's not.
[13:41:10] <m8> devinrolsen, :O
[13:41:26] <devinrolsen> + they did a lovely job with formatting right :)
[13:42:05] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: can you tell them to get stuffed and change the markup?
[13:42:25] <devinrolsen> not with the dealine about 2 days from now and 27 tickets deep in fixes.
[13:42:27] <devinrolsen> yay.
[13:42:28] <t4nkd> Hey can someone help me a bit with logging a function property?
[13:42:31] <devinrolsen> but normally yes.
[13:42:51] <devinrolsen> how I don't feel like the ids would cause it to fail in IE like this.
[13:42:58] <devinrolsen> one sec, getting my example up right now.
[13:44:29] <SpaceghostC2C> http://jsfiddle.net/hXqZn/ I'm trying to figure out how to load the DOM to use .html, but when I do it with $(document).ready it says the function isn't defined.
[13:44:41] <mythmon> so adding dom elements seems really clunky to me. is there a way to say like .after('tr.foo > td.bar') to add a tr with a td in it, with classes foo, bar?
[13:45:00] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: there is another option
[13:45:24] <ciss> slightly offtopic: i'm looking for a javascript minifier/packer written in javascript. any recommendations?
[13:45:35] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: use jquery to update hidden fields
[13:46:18] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: you need to load jquery, not mootools
[13:46:51] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: also, that looks like ASP tags
[13:46:52] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Um, it won't even work if I change the option.
[13:46:59] <SpaceghostC2C> Those aren't asp, they're erb.
[13:47:24] <ryanneufeld> either way, the browser doesn't know what to do withi t
[13:47:25] <timmywil> ?g uglifyjs @ ciss
[13:47:51] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Um, the browser wouldn't. I would have gisted it, but the /topic just says to use jsfiddle.
[13:48:13] <ciss> timmywil: thanks
[13:48:14] <SpaceghostC2C> My question is how to make sure the function gets defined when I make sure dom is loaded.
[13:49:15] <devinrolsen> ok, well that is interesting indeed ryanneufeld, seems like when I move that pages entire markup over and ditch all the scripts except for jquery (latest) and the validation plugin + my validation code.. it work fine in all browsers now.
[13:49:31] <devinrolsen> so must just be some freaky conflict in this huge freaking global.js file.
[13:49:32] <devinrolsen> awesome.
[13:49:37] <devinrolsen> well I have a starting point now.
[13:49:42] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: yup
[13:50:09] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: it looks fine to me
[13:50:32] <devinrolsen> oh and hey look, it's only 4k lines long. FML... thanks for all your help ryanneufeld, really appreciate it.
[13:51:15] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: you don't need to wrap any of that in DOM ready
[13:51:37] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: as long as you're not calling any of them until the DOM is ready, you're fine
[13:51:37] <SpaceghostC2C>  get this when I don't: Uncaught Error: NOT_FOUND_ERR: DOM Exception 8
[13:52:22] <ryanneufeld> I don't know what erb is, but if you could explain what that strange markup is trying to do
[13:52:25] <ryanneufeld> it might help
[13:52:25] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: How can I make sure not to call them? It's pretty ugly, just using onclick in the anchor. But the only thing requiring the dom is loaded is the .html
[13:52:42] <cbcwebdev> ryanneufeld erb is irrelevant, is parsed server side before it even reaches the browser
[13:52:52] <cbcwebdev> *it is
[13:52:55] <cbcwebdev> I didn't see his example
[13:53:12] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: It's just embedding ruby into the view. It takes a list of those words and uses them to make <a href="#Audio" id="audio" onclick="get_asset_list('audio')">Audio</a> for each of them.
[13:53:13] <cbcwebdev> but it will be parsed by the server before the HTML reaches the client
[13:53:24] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: can you update the fiddle with some example html output from your script
[13:54:09] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/hXqZn/3/
[13:56:55] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: If you'd like to try it, http://76.115.147.57:3000/teacher/courses/1/edit
[13:56:56] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: where on your page is your JS loaded?
[13:57:01] <ryanneufeld> perfect
[13:57:03] <ryanneufeld> that helps
[13:57:07] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: At the top.
[13:57:37] <ryanneufeld> have you looked at your source?
[13:57:57] <ryanneufeld> "&quot;steps&quot;, &quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;fields\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;fieldset&gt;\n  &lt;legend&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;input id=\&quot;course_sections_attributes_0"
[13:58:15] <SpaceghostC2C> Yeah.
[13:58:25] <ryanneufeld> you have un-quoted strings being passed as attributes
[13:58:35] <ryanneufeld> your JS is fine, your markup is horrid
[13:58:51] <hobot> lol
[13:58:57] <t4nkd> rofl
[13:59:01] <hobot> yeah horrid is an understatement
[13:59:43] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Yeah, those are part of a helper I'm working on. It doesn't seem to be related to the issue though.
[13:59:43] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: you don't need the document ready to wrap your functions if you're going to call them with onclick and they are included at the top of the page
[14:00:18] <ryanneufeld> I would bet, that by cleaning that up, you'd a) have a better product, and b) fix your bug in the process
[14:00:37] <ryanneufeld> if you're using jquery, why not use a selector and .click() to bind a function?
[14:00:39] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Hm, I wonder why it's not working only when I do the .html(data) though.
[14:01:22] <SpaceghostC2C> The only broken thing is that part. The rest works for now. I'll be refactoring those after I get this to work.
[14:01:31] <ryanneufeld> okay
[14:01:35] <ryanneufeld> step one
[14:01:40] <ryanneufeld> stop using alert for debugging
[14:01:51] <ryanneufeld> learn to use console.log and console.dir
[14:01:54] <ryanneufeld> step two
[14:02:05] <ryanneufeld> console.log(data) before doing the .html()
[14:02:13] <ryanneufeld> see if you have an object, or a string
[14:02:28] <ryanneufeld> I'm guessing since you're getting a .json file, it's not a string
[14:02:35] <ryanneufeld> which is part of your problem
[14:02:45] <SpaceghostC2C> It's an object.
[14:02:56] <ryanneufeld> ?.html()
[14:02:57] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[14:02:57] <SpaceghostC2C> But the get_asset_list function isn't defined.
[14:03:18] <ryanneufeld> take it out of the document.ready() you don't need it
[14:04:09] <ryanneufeld> next, read the docs on .html(), see what types of parameters it accepts
[14:04:15] <ryanneufeld> then, fix it.
[14:04:18] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: http://pastie.org/2151863
[14:04:38] <ryanneufeld> where is that coming from?
[14:04:55] <SpaceghostC2C> When I removed the document.ready() and tried clicking the images link.
[14:05:13] <ryanneufeld> http://76.115.147.57:3000/teacher/documents.json
[14:05:16] <ryanneufeld> well, fuck
[14:05:27] <t4nkd> The DOMException interface represents a processing error, for example when trying to create an invalid DOM, or passing a non-existent node as an argument to node manipulation methods. An exception is raised when an operation is impossible to perform, ie. in "exceptional" circumstances.
[14:05:29] <ryanneufeld> I wonder if maybe THAT has something to do with it
[14:05:32] <t4nkd> :0
[14:05:42] <t4nkd> shooock
[14:05:44] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Yeah currently only images can render Json.
[14:05:53] <ryanneufeld> wait, what?
[14:05:58] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Use the images link.
[14:06:49] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: you're not getting it
[14:07:08] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Is it the .html part that I'm doing wrong?
[14:07:27] <ryanneufeld> ? .html() @ SpaceghostC2C
[14:07:27] <bot-t> SpaceghostC2C, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[14:07:31] <ryanneufeld> READ THAT
[14:07:40] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: So then yeah. Mmk. Thanks.
[14:07:51] <ryanneufeld> look at the data type of data
[14:08:09] <ryanneufeld> and look at what .html() accepts (I said this earlier)
[14:08:45] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: you're passing an array of objects to a function that accepts strings
[14:09:02] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: that is what's causing your error
[14:10:00] <sherjilozair_> In [43]: Add(x, x)
[14:10:00] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: does that make sense?
[14:10:01] <sherjilozair_> Out[43]: 2â‹…x
[14:10:01] <sherjilozair_> In [44]: type(_)
[14:10:01] <sherjilozair_> Out[44]: <class 'sympy.core.mul.Mul'>
[14:10:17] <abjorn> Man, Fridays are sooooo slow. So slow my Supervisor let me off an hour early.
[14:10:58] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Yeah. I think I just got it. I need to find something to just populate the div with the results. Sorry about that.
[14:11:09] <ryanneufeld> there you go
[14:11:50] <ryanneufeld> SpaceghostC2C: don't be sorry, but the docs are your friend :)
[14:12:33] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Thank you. :D
[14:12:37] <ryanneufeld> also, console.log is much better than alert, if you leave on in, it doesn't usually get seen by users
[14:12:43] <ryanneufeld> *leave one in
[14:13:14] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Oh okay. I'll look up how to use it properly.
[14:13:29] <ryanneufeld> Another cool one
[14:13:33] <ryanneufeld> is console.dir()
[14:13:59] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: Where would be a good place to read about it?
[14:14:16] <ryanneufeld> you know... I don't know
[14:14:20] <ryanneufeld> I forget where I learned it
[14:14:29] <t4nkd> ryanneufeld: Hey do you use paul irish's log() wrapper at all or just the default?
[14:14:45] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanneufeld: I'll look it up. Thanks though, you've been a pal.
[14:14:51] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:14:53] <ryanneufeld> no worries
[14:36:40] <dingomanatee> any reccomendations for a good x/y scatter plotter in jQuery
[14:39:32] <gnrlbzik1> i need to intercept UI autocomplete search term
[14:53:36] <newbie``> hello
[14:54:00] <newbie``> how i can check if the dialog popup is already open or not?
[14:57:16] <hookdump> if ( $('#your-dialog').is(':visible') ) { do some stuff }
[15:01:35] <alexwait> hello all! I'm attempting to do the following and looking for ideas. I want to call $.when with a array of of ajax requests. After they're all completed, it'll call a function with one parameter that contains all the data that was retrieved in all those ajax calls
[15:01:55] <alexwait> is this something that is feasible?
[15:04:42] <alexwait> if so does anyone have any suggestions? :D
[15:14:58] <MoTiOnXml> anyone been working with iframes and .data()?
[15:14:59] <muzone_> At my price range slider at http://www.webdevout.net/test?01o - I tried to split the high and low prices up into seperate inputs so I could put one to the left and one to the right (instead of both to the left). But that didn't go so well - http://www.webdevout.net/test?026 - what have I done wrong?
[15:15:24] <randomguy> does jquery mobile has it's own irc channel?
[15:15:30] <MoTiOnXml> don't think so
[15:15:48] <randomguy> jquerymobile says "the official channel of jquery mobile" ?
[15:15:57] <randomguy> #jquerymobile that is

[15:47:10] <Gienio> muzone_ up
[15:48:45] <jtannenbaum> I have $('div').delegate('input[id^="btnDeleteLink"]', 'click', function(e){...}), but that just seems to add the function to the click response. How would I set it as the only function?
[15:51:56] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me
[15:52:15] <Gienio> hmm
[15:52:33] <Gienio> wheres ur question?
[15:52:48] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: My slideshow nav is not showing up which is suppose to be animating up but is not. Â Any ideas how I fix this? Â http://ecosanity.org/Â 
[15:56:46] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: do you see the problem?
[15:56:55] <Gienio> .slider is display: none
[15:57:00] <Gienio> should it be likethat?
[15:57:30] <Gienio> nav = thmubs ?
[15:58:06] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: yep
[15:58:42] <Gienio> so #cover has also class slider which is display: none; ind slides.css (line 134)
[15:58:53] <Gienio> turno it off and thums appear
[15:59:03] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: the thumbs should be sliding up, the jquery code should be working.
[15:59:10] <Gienio> oh ;)
[15:59:27] <k_89> has anyone had the issue of $.ajax calls throwing internal server error even when you can access the target urls via a browser
[15:59:29] <k_89> ??
[16:00:18] <Gienio> 500?
[16:00:23] <k_89> Gienio,
[16:00:26] <k_89> yes
[16:01:07] <Gienio> so it's internal server error ;)
[16:01:20] <Gienio> u can't do nothing with that
[16:01:20] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: just before div id="content" is the script for jquery
[16:01:47] <Gienio> is it cycle?
[16:01:57] <k_89> Gienio, its a simple routine code ($.ajax call), done it a lot of times before, but now its throwing 500 error
[16:02:19] <k_89> tested it on my local server and webserver
[16:02:45] <sherjilozair> How do you guys debug JQuery ?
[16:03:02] <Gienio> i see
[16:03:10] <sherjilozair> I'm new to it. And waste a lot of time figuring out how to make it work.
[16:03:11] <Gienio> u type .cover but it should be #cover
[16:03:38] <Gienio> or not;)
[16:03:42] <Gienio> its too late for me
[16:03:53] <dingomanatee> Most languages don't work if you use the wrong characters in your code :D
[16:04:02] <Gienio> and u should not have same names for ids and clases
[16:04:15] <k_89> sherjilozair, firefox->firebug , chrome->dev tools
[16:04:16] <sherjilozair> Anyone ?
[16:06:11] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: changing that
[16:07:42] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: I change the id to over
[16:07:49] <Gienio> leave #cover
[16:08:22] <Gienio> then jQuery(".cover", this) -> jQuery('#cover')
[16:09:37] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: which one there are three of them
[16:09:50] <ShawnRisk> ?
[16:10:23] <sherjilozair> Thanks ! :)
[16:11:42] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: that didn't help, I changed all three with no luck
[16:12:31] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: did you see this error: [cycle] terminating; too few slides: 1
[16:12:41] <Gienio> http://pastie.org/2152288
[16:12:59] <Gienio> yes i can see that
[16:15:46] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: I copied that and took out the function that was there.  This still didn't work out.
[16:18:02] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: I shouldn't change the .cover ones above?
[16:18:32] <Gienio> http://pastie.org/2152309
[16:18:32] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: are you sure this is the jquery acting up and this is not my cms?
[16:18:52] <Gienio> well i put that code via firebug and it works ;)
[16:20:25] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: I just uploaded this and it didn't work out.  there is still a .cover
[16:22:28] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: are you seeing the same problem as me or is this working for you now?
[16:22:46] <Gienio> i belive that code should be runned after cycle is fully inited
[16:23:00] <Gienio> it should has a callback for that
[16:23:50] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: oh, how to fix this?
[16:24:02] <Gienio> where's ur cycle js code?
[16:24:55] <Gienio> k i got it
[16:24:59] <ShawnRisk> :D
[16:25:07] <ShawnRisk> jquery.cycle.all.min.js
[16:30:04] <Gienio> hmm
[16:31:34] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: just to say this was working before
[16:32:18] <Gienio> but?
[16:32:52] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: all of a sudden this broke for no reason.  I didn't change anything.  I can look again but I didn't change anything I don't think
[16:33:59] <koalas> anyone want to make some money helping me with a relatively simple problem
[16:36:34] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: I looked, and I didn't change anything at all.  I am not sure.
[16:36:42] <Gienio> maybe that 'terminating...' error causes cover problem
[16:38:11] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: how do I fix this?
[16:38:24] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: can I put back the original code?
[16:38:49] <Gienio> i think, you can
[16:39:01] <Gienio> then try to disable ticker plugin
[16:39:05] <Gienio> and check it out
[16:40:53] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: that worked out, why is the ticker affecting the slider thumbs?
[16:41:32] <Gienio> it causes js error
[16:41:43] <Gienio> so scripts stops at this point
[16:41:50] <Gienio> oh damn
[16:42:03] <Gienio> i need to sleep, cant even look at my english now ;)
[16:42:09] <Nyxxie> hello!
[16:42:19] <Nyxxie> If anyone can answer a quick question for me I'll be thrilled!
[16:42:28] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: thanks but is there no way to fix this before you go?
[16:42:37] <Nyxxie> Does anyone know why i wont get anything after " in a textfeild with this code var areaText = $('.forum_message').val();
[16:42:37] <ShawnRisk> ask?
[16:43:15] <ShawnRisk> Nyxxie: have you tried $(.forum_message).val(); ?
[16:43:47] <Nyxxie> Let me try that!
[16:44:03] <Nyxxie> I'm quite the noob!
[16:44:19] <Gienio> hm
[16:45:03] <Gienio> ticker uses #js-news
[16:45:12] <Gienio> i cant find it in ur code
[16:45:24] <Nyxxie> hmm, that just seemed to make it angry and not work at all, ShawnRisk.
[16:45:35] <Nyxxie> Any other suggestions? This has been doing my head in!
[16:45:47] <ShawnRisk> Nyxxie: thought so, I am not sure
[16:45:50] <Nyxxie> It's to quote another user.
[16:46:02] <Nyxxie> and anything after " gets removed.
[16:46:31] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: because there are not events coming up that is why.
[16:46:47] <Nyxxie>  	$('.quote').click(function() {var areaText = $('.forum_message').val();  		$(".forum_message")[0].value = areaText +"\n"+ $(this).find(".postcontent").val(); });  is the code
[16:47:18] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: can I put an if statement saying if empty don't do that code?
[16:48:17] <Gienio> http://pastie.org/pastes/2152406/text
[16:48:20] <Gienio> code for ticker
[16:48:27] <Gienio> just check if js-news exists
[16:48:36] <Gienio> if yes, then init ticker plugin
[16:49:08] <ShawnRisk> Nyxxie: can't you add var forummessage = $('.forum_message'); and just use.
[16:50:17] <Gienio> Nyxxie how r u gonna use textarea val?
[16:51:45] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: okay that works, but you are 100% sure this will work out?  I know what length does, but I don't want this to break in the future.
[16:51:51] <Nyxxie> Gienio, I'm using it to get the current input from the message
[16:52:01] <Nyxxie> from te post im quoting
[16:52:26] <Gienio> ShawnRisk ticker will work if it'll be a #js-new in your html output
[16:52:57] <Nyxxie> l'm using it to get the data from the post and then placing it into a textarea
[16:53:17] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: if #js-news shows up in my html output this will work.  Okay I will wait for that.
[16:53:27] <Gienio> ;)
[16:53:40] <Nyxxie> I've tried using .html() but have the same issue. :(
[16:53:50] <Gienio> what about .text() ?
[16:54:37] <Nyxxie> Same issues.
[16:55:34] <Gienio> and why dont u use .val( new_value_code)
[16:55:50] <ShawnRisk> Gienio: thanks for this
[16:55:56] <Gienio> np
[16:56:17] <Gienio> and it's all about escaping strings from val
[16:56:26] <Gienio> so google it or wait ;) cos im already dead
[16:57:17] <Gienio> maybe this will help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2221093/textarea-value-to-paragraph-html-as-text-only
[16:57:47] <Nyxxie> I don't need ot set the value, just get it from that post and put it in a text area. http://pastebin.com/ZVmVVjfa
[16:59:08] <Gienio> sec
[17:02:16] <Gienio> http://jsfiddle.net/A4uhH/
[17:02:22] <Gienio> like this?
[17:02:27] <Gienio> Nyxxie
[17:05:53] <McKnight> <Gienio> She does not want the html going in the text area
[17:06:51] <ShawnRisk> I have to go for dinner but will be back later
[17:07:18] <McKnight> Wait that would not be a problem sorry
[17:07:48] <Gienio> i dont understand the problem ;)
[17:08:03] <Gienio> just change .val() to .html() and do what u want
[17:08:18] <Gienio> 2am
[17:08:20] <Gienio> cya ;)
[17:11:34] <acidjazz> im having some major issues w/ jquery and ie9
[17:11:42] <acidjazz> is there anythin gin general i should know about?
[17:13:15] <sagrotan> hi, using ajax and jquery to parse an rss feed... all tags i want to read work great except for the <link>-tag. always empty, no way to get it
[17:13:28] <sagrotan> any ideas?
[17:14:59] <sagrotan> $(xmldata).find('link').text()  is empty :(
[17:19:34] <mehale> how can I match Â´table tr tdÂ´ OR Â´formÂ´  ?
[17:21:29] <McChen> hi guys
[17:21:32] <McChen> got a question
[17:21:37] <mehale> fire
[17:22:01] <McChen> i would like to add class to an element if it has a particular sibling, how should i write that?
[17:23:05] <mehale> http://api.jquery.com/siblings/ ?
[17:24:11] <McChen> that only tells me how to apply class to the sibling elements, isn't it
[17:24:37] <sagrotan> could it be that jquery confuses the html link tag with the xml-tag "link" of my rss feed?
[17:24:40] <blindMoe> McChen: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/RQXsa/1/
[17:25:25] <McChen> blindMoe: thanks, but that's not what i'm asking for
[17:26:02] <blindMoe> McChen: you want it only if it _has_ siblings?  Or siblings of a certain selector?
[17:26:12] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/RQXsa/2/
[17:26:23] <McChen> would like to apply an additional class to div.test if div.test has a siblings with the class .not-test
[17:26:42] <blindMoe> ahh I see
[17:27:29] <joshsmith> can you load jQuery within an embeddable iFrame?
[17:28:17] <mehale> McChen: seems like u can use a selector on that
[17:28:53] <McChen> mehale: hmm?
[17:29:09] <mehale> $("p").siblings(".selected").css("background", "yellow"); - from the example
[17:29:27] <McChen> but that's not what i'm looking for
[17:29:34] <mehale> you could test it
[17:29:46] <McChen> i have tried that already
[17:30:38] <mehale> McChen: this works here: if ( $('table') ) console.log('blah');
[17:31:04] <mehale> ops, sorry, it works with anything
[17:31:53] <mehale> McChen: stupid hack, but may work: if ( $('table').length > 0 )
[17:32:26] <McChen> let me open up a jsfiddle as well and show you guys where i have trouble with
[17:32:30] <McChen> brb
[17:38:55] <McChen> http://jsfiddle.net/codeincube/EbEAy/
[17:45:48] <McChen> hmm
[17:45:55] <McChen> can anyone help?
[17:47:24] <Brodingo> sup
[17:48:49] <McChen> Brodingo: http://jsfiddle.net/codeincube/EbEAy/
[17:49:19] <McChen> i am attempting to apply a class to an <li> if it has the children <ul> nested in it
[17:49:26] <mehale> McChen: http://jsfiddle.net/EbEAy/1/
[17:49:29] <McChen> but couldn't get it working
[17:49:47] <Brodingo> http://jsfiddle.net/EbEAy/2/
[17:49:58] <mephux> http://goo.gl/X2egc
[17:50:25] <Brodingo> dont use mehale's
[17:50:44] <Brodingo> no offense mehale :)
[17:50:50] <mehale> why not? mine is more beautiful
[17:51:06] <Brodingo> it completely strips an element of previous classes
[17:51:13] <Brodingo> thats a no no
[17:51:20] <Brodingo> just addClass()
[17:51:28] <McChen> well i appreciate it
[17:51:30] <McChen> but the thing is
[17:51:54] <mehale> ah, sure
[17:51:57] <McChen> if i wanna simply do addClass to "li ul" i would just do that
[17:52:11] <McChen> but i would like the word "Main Item 2" to be red
[17:52:19] <McChen> not its nested ul to be red
[17:52:30] <mehale> thats more expensive then
[17:52:38] <McChen> yeah lol
[17:52:48] <McChen> that's why i have to come up here to ask
[17:53:01] <McChen> i have tried multiple different methods
[17:53:04] <Brodingo> no
[17:53:10] <Brodingo> stop there
[17:53:11] <McChen> search around and stuff, and still can't find it
[17:53:17] <Brodingo> that can be done with css
[17:53:47] <Brodingo> li.hasClassUL { color: red} .hasClassUL ul {color: #000}
[17:53:50] <Brodingo> etc
[17:54:01] <Brodingo> and the only thing you need to do is add that class
[17:54:09] <McChen> that's if i can add that class in
[17:54:24] <McChen> i am theming a structure that i am not allowed to add class in
[17:54:29] <McChen> that's why i have to resort to js
[17:54:40] <mehale> poor you :)
[17:54:44] <McChen> i mean i am not allowed to alter the mockup
[17:55:03] <Brodingo> wow cool
[17:55:15] <McChen> T_T :(
[17:55:28] <McChen> i'm banging my head, lol
[17:56:16] <Brodingo> $('li:has(ul)').css('color','red').find('ul').css('color','black')
[17:57:15] <Brodingo> seemed to work ok http://jsfiddle.net/EbEAy/3/
[17:59:41] <McChen> ha, maybe that's it
[17:59:47] <McChen> let me try it out
[18:00:54] <Dr4g> why this not workin
[18:00:54] <Dr4g> find('select[name="perpage-value"] option:selected').val();
[18:04:46] <McChen> Brodingo: that's really close
[18:04:50] <McChen> thanks a lot!!
[18:04:56] <Dr4g> help ?
[18:05:06] <McChen> i will just need to tweek it a little more to fit my actual code
[18:05:11] <McChen> thanks a big bunch!

[18:14:22] <a\m> hi all
[18:15:01] <a\m> first attempt to extend jQuery...
[18:15:12] <a\m> I'd like to create an attribute offset().right
[18:15:52] <a\m> any tips or links on how to do that?
[18:16:09] <a\m> (other than the plugins/authoring page)
[18:16:39] <meme> http://pastie.org/private/jhgjegccgofujbqrjmgtga
[18:16:50] <meme> not sure why btnSave does not work

[18:48:54] <fogus> I cannot seem to load jsfiddle
[18:49:16] <fogus> waiting for some fonts google thing
[18:49:24] <fogus> oh, there it goes
[18:49:26] <systemfault> Works here (c)
[18:52:03] <fogus> systemfault: ok, working now
[18:52:07] <fogus> check out http://jsfiddle.net/AtCW4/1/
[18:52:34] <fogus> all I'm trying to do is check to see if something exists so I don't execute the main code on *every* load
[18:52:42] <fogus> live page at http://beta.faithvan.com/node/11
[18:53:00] <fogus> firebug freaks out with "$("div.content").find("a.active").parent("li").attr("class") is undefined" every time
[18:53:03] <fogus> well, fair enough
[18:53:12] <fogus> but I'm trying to see if it exists
[18:53:19] <fogus> "if ($($("div.content").find("a.active...").attr("class").split(" ")).length){"
[19:22:01] <Brodingo> Dr4g you dont need to get the option, just the select list
[19:22:03] <djQuery> so your trying to check and see how many classes the parent has?
[19:22:17] <Dr4g> Brodingo: indeed it was a HTML error not a JS error
[19:26:01] <amid_hasan> how do you clear the value of a variable?
[19:28:59] <djQuery> amid_hasan: x=undefined
[19:29:16] <Acorn> I'm having trouble getting the response headers from an AJAX request, can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? http://jsbin.com/uhidud/2/edit
[19:30:44] <Acorn> jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders() should work right?
[19:32:28] <amid_hasan> also, how do you clear the html contents of a div?
[19:32:51] <djQuery> amid_hasan: your kidding right?
[19:32:52] <amid_hasan> div.html("")?
[19:33:11] <amid_hasan> djQuery: no, I am having issues where appending content from a variable along with html into a div
[19:33:20] <amid_hasan> then I run some functions but the content is appended OVER the div
[19:33:37] <amid_hasan> I guess i need to clear the appended content before I run the same function again
[19:34:17] <djQuery> amid_hasan: where $('#mydiv').html('')
[19:34:36] <amid_hasan> djQuery: thank you!
[19:34:36] <djQuery> amid_hasan: see ?jqf
[19:34:37] <bot-t> amid_hasan, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[19:35:02] <amid_hasan> that looks like an awesome reference. thanks
[19:38:47] <Davey> I'm trying to find a <select> replacement that I can style better, figured jquery-ui would have one, but no... any suggestions?
[19:42:04] <jonathanrwallace> i'm using jquery to $('form').submit() and the form has a target=_blank but it isn't opening up in a new window
[19:46:23] <Acorn> Is there nothing obvious I'm doing wrong?
[19:47:20] <djQuery> Davey: see ?ui.autocomplete
[19:47:20] <bot-t> Davey, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[19:47:41] <Davey> djQuery: no, I need a <select>
[19:47:43] <djQuery> Davey: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[19:47:57] <Davey> it's purely style, I want the same functionality... that might work
[19:50:22] <Davey> not really what I want
[19:50:30] <Davey> djQuery: any other suggestions?
[19:50:44] <Acorn> I can see the response headers when I look at FireBug.. so it seems odd that I just get nothing..
[19:51:52] <dismist> acorn: does firebug need an addon to view that?
[19:52:28] <Acorn> dismist: nope, you just look in the NET tab
[19:53:25] <Acorn> Or if you have the console set to show XHRs then you can see requests there
[19:53:25] <dismist> i certainly dont see my session cookie for the https server i am logged into
[19:53:27] <dismist> under the net tab
[19:53:55] <dismist> just a bunch of images and the html file
[19:55:16] <dismist> oh shit
[19:55:19] <dismist> it is there!
[19:55:25] <dismist> had to expand it
[19:55:31] <dismist> is that accessible via javascript????
[19:56:25] <jonathanrwallace> why do i see different behavior when i do $('input#my_submit_button').click() vs. manually clicking the same submit button when the target of the form is set to _blank?
[19:57:11] <dismist> i dont think target is taken into account when u simulate the click
[19:57:39] <dismist> just like an onclick handler probably wouldnt fire on a simulated click
[19:58:57] <jonathanrwallace> i'll try form.submit() instead
[19:59:34] <jonathanrwallace> nope
[19:59:38] <jonathanrwallace> no luck then either
[19:59:59] <dismist> fuck a target
[20:00:13] <jonathanrwallace> part of the client's request!
[20:00:37] <dismist> http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[20:29:42] <jonathanrwallace> dismist: not sure how i'm supposed to use that to help me.  basically, target is ignored if i use jquery to submit the form.  https://gist.github.com/5921d2c9c2161b405025
[20:32:08] <pen> hey
[20:32:31] <pen> if I have a each function inside a click callback, how do I get the this in click callback inside each function?
[20:32:57] <pen> because the this in each will be the element of the array that I'm iterating over
[20:33:04] <pen> how do I get the other this?
[20:35:42] <djQuery> pen: .click(function(e){ var $this = $(this); $this.find('.whatever').each(function(i,elm){ HEY $this is still in correct scope}););});
[20:36:24] <pen> so you mean if I do list.each the $this will still not be in scope?
[20:37:02] <djQuery> compleltly opisition $this is still in scrope until you leave the click
[20:37:09] <pen> oh
[20:37:10] <dismist> jonathanrwallace: u might have to get a little complex with it... such as doing a window.open and executing a script onload
[20:37:27] <pen> I see
[20:37:32] <djQuery> ?ftjq
[20:37:32] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[20:37:36] <jonathanrwallace> yeah, that's what i think i found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/178964/javascript-post-on-form-submit-open-a-new-window
[20:37:48] <dismist> nice research
[20:37:50] <djQuery> pen: there is a better explanition of $this in there
[20:37:51] <dismist> sorry i was so late to respond
[20:38:16] <jonathanrwallace> no worries, i appreciate your help!
[21:17:26] <pen> hey
[21:18:02] <dismist> sup nigga
[21:18:30] <pen> if I have a element is a div with class .input wraps a input element, if I do $('input', elem) do I get the input in it?
[21:18:59] <pen> because it keep telling me that
[21:19:02] <dismist> $('.input input');
[21:19:14] <djQuery> is it an element or a jquery object
[21:19:16] <pen> elem in in an array and I'm looping through them
[21:19:17] <pen> using each
[21:19:27] <dismist> thats saying all child elements that are inputs inside of the container class input
[21:19:30] <pen> oh, should be jqury object I guess
[21:19:37] <dismist> nah, u can use .each
[21:19:53] <pen> so I grab all div with class .input
[21:19:56] <pen> using jqeury
[21:20:07] <pen> like $('.input')
[21:20:10] <pen> and then i loop through them
[21:20:15] <dismist> nah
[21:20:18] <dismist> .input input
[21:20:23] <dismist> all input boxes inside .input div
[21:20:34] <djQuery> $('div.input').find('input').each(
[21:20:36] <pen> I would do that if I don't need to do other stuff with .input
[21:20:45] <dismist> unnecessary dj
[21:20:56] <pen> and now it is saying that
[21:21:23] <djQuery> I know he could do $('div.input input').each
[21:21:26] <pen> $('input', elem).attr('name') is not defined when I clearly see it having it in the browser
[21:21:41] <dismist> you're not listening
[21:21:43] <djQuery> well what is elem
[21:21:47] <pen> I can, but I told you I need to do something with .input
[21:21:48] <dismist> $('.input input')
[21:21:54] <Vorspire> selecting form elements? :S
[21:21:55] <dismist> if the div they are wrapped in has the class input
[21:21:56] <pen> sorry, elem is the this inside each
[21:22:16] <djQuery> pen: what are u actualy trying to do with them?
[21:22:24] <pen> djQuery, change their attributes
[21:22:28] <pen> change name and id
[21:22:41] <pen> but it keeps telling me that it is undefined
[21:22:43] <ohboy> $('input', elem)
[21:22:43] <djQuery> pen: its not so good changing the id
[21:22:45] <ohboy> what the hell is that?
[21:22:52] <pen> elem is the this inside each
[21:22:56] <djQuery> is elem and element or a jquery object?
[21:23:00] <pen> I grab all elements with class input
[21:23:03] <pen> and loop through them
[21:23:04] <dismist> first of all
[21:23:08] <dismist> u dont need to apply an each
[21:23:16] <pen> djQuery, I don't know :\ should be jquery object
[21:23:17] <dismist> u can use one selector to apply whatever to all of tem
[21:23:29] <ohboy> $("input") will get all of them
[21:23:46] <dismist> ie, $('.input input').addClass('imaninput'); will add the class imaninput for every input within the div that has the class "input"
[21:23:48] <djQuery> dismist: he said he was changing the id so I hope he does an each rather than chaning them all to the same thing
[21:23:54] <Vorspire> isn't there an ":input" selector?
[21:23:58] <dismist> but you're making things complicated as fuck by saying your wrapper has the class input
[21:24:09] <djQuery> ?:input
[21:24:10] <bot-t> :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[21:24:11] <pen> djQuery, yea
[21:24:13] <ohboy> why would you change the name or id of something?
[21:24:20] <pen> ohboy, why not?
[21:24:40] <ohboy> well usually when you give something an id, it's because you want to identify it uniquely
[21:24:41] <djQuery> pen: cause some browsers throw a fit when you change the id
[21:24:42] <pen> I need to change it or it will not work with backend
[21:24:44] <dismist> maybe u have a function that applies certain elements based on the naming convention of the id
[21:25:03] <pen> dismist, it has a naming convention and that's why i'm grabbing it and then change it
[21:25:08] <djQuery> pen: back end never sees the id in anykinda post etc..
[21:25:11] <dismist> pen: sounds like your whole approach is wrong
[21:25:26] <Vorspire> ?jqeng
[21:25:27] <bot-t> English jQuery users may be offended by the accessor $, if offense occurs, change $ to £ and bang head on desk.
[21:25:31] <ohboy> if it already has a naming convention, why can't you just use that?
[21:25:49] <pen> please, just tell me why it keep telling me that it is undefined. how do I know if this is a jquery object or not
[21:26:03] <ohboy> can you show us the html
[21:26:35] <djQuery> pen: probably because elem is not a jquery object but rather a resular element. have you tried console.log(elem)
[21:26:49] <pen> djQuery, no, ok I will do that
[21:28:06] <pen> djQuery, so console.log will log it in the console of safari inspect elements??
[21:28:09] <Vorspire> even so, you can convert anything to a jQuery element by wrapping it with $( ) - as far as I know anyway.. works on Arrays andsuch
[21:28:18] <pen> hmm
[21:28:37] <dismist> thats what ive been trying to drill into his head
[21:28:39] <dismist> he will not listen
[21:28:58] <pen> dismist, where do you say that? wrap it with $()?
[21:29:09] <pen> anyway, it is actually something else. I guess it is with replace
[21:29:10] <ohboy> can you just show us the html you're trying to manipulate
[21:29:22] <pen> yea, replace is buggy
[21:30:34] <pen> aha, sorry guys I was using a javascript function on jquery object I guess that's why it doesn 't work
[21:30:49] <pen> I do replace after I use attr
[21:31:20] <djQuery> penn: or just do $(elem).find('input').each(function(i){});
[21:31:42] <djQuery> penn: but it sounds like you are allready nessted pretty deep
[21:31:49] <pen> how?
[21:31:56] <pen> only 1 level deep
[21:34:36] <pen> djQuery, thanks for the trick for logging. it helps a lot
[21:35:06] <djQuery> pen: then check out this see ?ftjq
[21:35:07] <bot-t> pen, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[21:35:43] <pen> I think I found the reason, there is nothing wrong with my code, just that there is a textarea and I still use input
[21:35:45] <pen> so it is undefined
[21:35:46] <pen> :P
[21:35:54] <pen> yea thanks guys for the help
[21:36:14] <djQuery> penn see ?:input
[21:36:15] <bot-t> :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[21:36:35] <Vorspire> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3]; try{ print(' 1: ' + arr.end()); } catch(e) { print(' 1: ' + e.message); } try{ print(' 2: ' + $(arr).end()); } catch(e) { print(' 2: ' + e.message); }
[21:36:36] <bot-t> Vorspire: " 1: arr.end is not a function"" 2: [object Object]"
[21:37:01] <pen> djQuery, cool
[21:37:11] <pen> yea, I should've use that as someone suggested it
[21:37:12] <pen> :P
[21:37:18] <grantg> heh
[21:37:28] <grantg> the whinehouse hack used jquery
[21:37:38] <Vorspire> lol

[21:38:00] <Vorspire> I started using jQuery and I'll never look back :)
[21:38:38] <Iarfen> hi
[21:39:20] <grantg> They should have just turned her site into that backpack girl site
[21:39:30] <Iarfen> what is the problem with that ajax?? http://jsfiddle.net/uymwW/
[21:39:34] <pen> Vorspire, your parents are glad to hear that :P
[21:39:37] <Iarfen> please I need help
[21:39:58] <Vorspire> (pen): huh what? :D
[21:40:04] <Vorspire> I love C# more than jQery <3
[21:40:16] <Vorspire> but it's essential imo
[21:40:16] <pen> then your parents frown on you
[21:40:19] <pen> :P
[21:40:20] <pen> jk
[21:40:23] <Vorspire> lmao
[21:40:32] <denysonique> Vorspire: you are a masochist
[21:40:46] <Vorspire> I am, or am I?
[21:41:24] <denysonique> Ruby on Rails is the most productive web dev pleasantry
[21:42:01] <Vorspire> I prefer PHP + jQuery - done some pretty awesome stuff with it so far
[21:42:07] <Vorspire> PHP feels limited without JQ
[21:42:17] <grantg> yo dawg
[21:42:35] <grantg> JQ is JS
[21:43:14] <Vorspire> Yes, but in order to achieve the perfect balance of functionality, PHP + JQ ftw :)
[21:44:09] <ohboy> you really can't do any cool interactive things without javascript
[21:44:17] <ohboy> unless you use some bullshit like silverlight or flash
[21:44:21] <Iarfen> anyone can help me?? Please I need help
[21:44:24] <Vorspire> ugh
[21:44:31] <Vorspire> silverlight/flash blasphemy!
[21:44:55] <Vorspire> ?ask @ Iarfen
[21:44:56] <bot-t> Iarfen, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:45:08] <systemfault> You can do some nice things with css3 :P
[21:45:29] <ohboy> which you never get to use in the real world because the customer always wants things to work in ie7 *&@#)@*&#@#*(&@#(
[21:45:33] <grantg> Vorspire: So you like Java Applets? </troll>
[21:45:34] <Iarfen> What is wrong with my ajax??  http://jsfiddle.net/uymwW/
[21:45:36] <Vorspire> does it support 1-degree rotation units?
[21:45:39] <Vorspire> (CSS3)
[21:45:44] <Iarfen> That's a good question right?
[21:46:10] <ohboy> css3 just isn't mature enough yet
[21:46:20] <Vorspire> (grantg): Java is something I never bothered with, the closes I got was pjIRC
[21:46:21] <ohboy> grandmas don't have css3 capable browsers yet
[21:46:38] <grantg> says the ie6 user
[21:46:58] <Vorspire> Iarfen, you can't test ajax on jsfiddle as far as I know, due to the same-domain policy
[21:47:31] <Iarfen> But I need to know only what is wrong
[21:47:44] <Vorspire> The sooner Internet Exploder is buried and gone, the better for the interwebz
[21:47:45] <Iarfen> I put echo 'Hola!!'; in the ajax requested file
[21:47:49] <djQuery> Vorspire: check the help files you can
[21:47:56] <Iarfen> but it gives me all the code of the page that request that, what's wrong?
[21:48:06] <pen> Vorspire, I totally agree with that statement
[21:48:14] <grantg> Vorspire meanwhile we can continue hacking ie6 users for the lulz. :P
[21:48:16] <Iarfen> Yes I agree too with thtat, Vorspire
[21:48:18] <Vorspire> been a while since I've used jsfiddle :/ last thing I fiddled with on there was a testris demo in JQ lol
[21:48:26] <Vorspire> Tetris*
[21:48:32] <grantg> and redirect them to fake antivirus pages
[21:48:46] <djQuery> Vorspire: it basicaly just echos whatever you sendit
[21:49:18] <djQuery> think its funny that most ie6 users are in china
[21:50:37] <grantg> heh, I still find it funny people rely on jquery
[21:50:39] <systemfault> Yeah... But most chinese don't have credit cards.
[21:50:44] <systemfault> So I won't support IE6
[21:50:44] <grantg> when they don't need it
[21:51:00] <grantg> Use DOM. <_<
[21:51:14] <systemfault> grantg: Masochist.
[21:51:19] <grantg> Too bad many jquery devs are just copy pasters not willing to learn DOM. :P
[21:51:24] <djQuery> ie6 use in north america is 1.6%
[21:51:35] <systemfault> djQuery: Yeah, mostly corps :P
[21:51:42] <systemfault> And old aunts..
[21:51:58] <grantg> And corps use ie6 for intranet bullcrap
[21:52:10] <grantg> many corps don't even let ie6 connect out
[21:52:25] <djQuery> ie6 in china is 40.76 the top browser
[21:52:42] <systemfault> djQuery: Followed by korea
[21:52:44] <iszak> Yay
[21:52:49] <iszak> Long live IE6
[21:52:52] <systemfault> But still.. they don't have credit cards.

[21:53:20] <iszak> if you're that worried just force users to install Chrome Frame
[21:53:25] <iszak> seen it
[21:53:25] <Vorspire> why should i compensate MIN-HEIGHT *just* for IE6?!?! but WAIT there's MORE! IE6/MAC is 100% standard compliant... Oo
[21:53:25] <Lampoon> Sorry, I haven't seen it.
[21:53:33] <systemfault> Even MS said that china is an irrelevant market for them :/
[21:53:39] <iszak> good for you bot, now get back to work
[21:53:49] <djQuery> iszak: so they are even more vulnerable?
[21:54:02] <iszak> why would they be even more vulnerable?
[21:54:34] <systemfault> A bit less than 3 years and we won't hear of IE6 ever again.

[21:55:05] <systemfault> :P
[21:55:15] <iszak> well djQuery?
[21:55:29] <grantg> systemfault: So they have to keep windows update off
[21:55:37] <grantg> to prevent the windows genuine bullshit
[21:55:42] <systemfault> :P
[21:55:51] <grantg> Otherwise they'd have IE8 now, wouldn't they?

[21:56:27] <grantg> nice knowing china computer users are all exploitable
[21:56:29] <djQuery> qeez you would think someone would hack an update server for them
[21:56:36] <grantg> *chinese
[21:56:59] <iszak> but IE6 is /secure/ if proper precautions are taken.
[21:57:08] <grantg> iszak: gtfo
[21:57:13] <Vorspire> Like hitting the UNINSTALL button?
[21:57:18] <grantg> yeah, if you disconnect the goddamn internet
[21:57:24] <systemfault> grantg: IE6 is secure...
[21:57:28] <systemfault> I hate to say it...
[21:57:39] <Vorspire> yea, on MAC
[21:57:40] <iszak> This is according to the UK Government, "It is therefore more cost-effective in many cases to continue to use IE6 and rely on other measures, such as firewalls and malware-scanning software, to further protect public sector internet users,"
[21:57:41] <systemfault> It's crap... non-standard but it is secure.. :(
[21:58:10] <grantg> systemfault: Tell that to the modal alert dialogs
[21:58:19] <systemfault> MS still patch IE6 I mean..
[21:58:23] <grantg> that keep coming until a user downloads fake anti-virus
[21:58:34] <systemfault> grantg: Ah yeah.. sure
[21:58:50] <systemfault> Gotta love "Super Antivirus XP Pro Super Mega cool 2011"

[21:59:56] <grantg> also
[22:00:00] <grantg> you can still crash ie6
[22:00:03] <grantg> easily
[22:00:06] <Vorspire> People need life-skills in "how to not click that stupid flashy popup with the big bold text that you've never seen before"
[22:00:20] <iszak> grantg, that's a feature! it prevents the executing code from infecting your system.
[22:00:40] <grantg> Vorspire: You can't click anything off when your browser is bouncing around the screen
[22:00:52] <grantg> iszak: not with many ie6 bugs seen
[22:00:59] <grantg> like the CSS rule crash bug
[22:01:00] <djQuery> remember reading an article on how one of the auto manu is still using windows nt for some of the workstations. they have a remote image applied to it nightly
[22:01:06] <grantg> and js in css
[22:01:11] <grantg> lots of crashes there
[22:01:16] <Enginay> holy fuckin shit.. flipping an image in a cross-broswer manner is quite challenging
[22:01:20] <grantg> instability bugs more like it
[22:01:23] <iszak> grantg, like I said, security!
[22:01:33] <grantg> iszak: That's not security
[22:01:40] <grantg> That's a normal program crash
[22:01:41] <Enginay> I managed to flip it in all browsers but in IE it loses PNG transparency
[22:01:43] <iszak> what sane person puts JS in CSS!
[22:01:46] <iszak> that's an attack I tell you
[22:01:53] <grantg> iszak: JS libs
[22:02:01] <systemfault> Don't we all love IE? :(
[22:02:06] <grantg> For emulating min-wdth and min-height

[22:02:32] <systemfault> grantg: Ah :P
[22:02:34] <grantg> why?
[22:02:47] <systemfault> Curious to see how fast they made chakra :/
[22:02:50] <Vorspire> Enginay; are you using PHP GD to redraw the image?
[22:03:20] <Enginay> voronika, what do you think ?
[22:03:28] <iszak> no but seriously, I hate IE6.
[22:03:37] <systemfault> I hate it too :(
[22:03:49] <grantg> JS in CSS lol
[22:03:59] <grantg> That was a big hack
[22:04:04] <grantg> for min-width
[22:04:13] <Enginay> why are you even supporting IE6 ?
[22:04:22] <grantg> I'm just saying
[22:04:29] <grantg> and major sites still do that
[22:04:41] <grantg> and apply this bullshit automatically in legacy js libs
[22:04:43] <grantg> like google
[22:04:45] <grantg> and yahoo
[22:04:46] <Enginay> well, I'd consider facebook a major site
[22:04:47] <grantg> and aol
[22:04:48] <grantg> etc
[22:04:51] <systemfault> Google is killing IE7 support on august 1st :P
[22:05:00] <Vorspire> You know what else grinds my gears? Flippin' rounded corners... IE WTH?
[22:05:01] <systemfault> (On most of their apps)
[22:05:06] <Enginay> there's no reason why google wouldn't suppor it, it's basic functionality is a input text
[22:05:07] <grantg> doesn't mean they'll stop these compat hacks
[22:05:16] <Enginay> facebook does not support IE6
[22:05:36] <grantg> they still have legacy hacks that they're not willing to remove
[22:05:44] <grantg> they just work around them
[22:05:52] <Enginay> they do NOT support IE6.
[22:06:06] <Vorspire> Doesn't FB deliver their mobile site to IE6?
[22:06:07] <Enginay> hacks might stay around but they just don't
[22:06:20] <Enginay> just visit the site with IE6 and see the warning
[22:06:20] <grantg> Enginay: Because IE6 JUST CAN'T render shit right
[22:06:22] <grantg> that's why
[22:06:25] <systemfault> Who uses mobile facebook?
[22:06:33] <Enginay> and IE6 market share is now negligible
[22:06:35] <grantg> there's a point to where the hacks can't cut it
[22:06:41] <systemfault> I mean.. Most people I know use their smartphone facebook software.
[22:06:41] <grantg> IE6 is that shitty
[22:06:41] <Vorspire> lol, I'm not falling for that.. I don't have IE6 and I don't intend to :D
[22:06:55] <Enginay> Vorspire, see IE Tester
[22:07:05] <Vorspire> *noted*
[22:07:10] <iszak> Microsoft should bundle Windows Phone 7 with IE6!

[22:07:33] <systemfault> iszak: Windows Phone 7 has some kind of IE7 :/
[22:07:35] <Enginay> every browser vendor should pull their crappy product from market
[22:07:37] <Enginay> except chrome
[22:07:39] <Vorspire> I can't wait for Windows 8 :) Maybe they will finally fix Aero
[22:07:41] <Enginay> and we should all code against it
[22:07:42] <systemfault> Soon, it will have an update with IE9
[22:07:46] <iszak> yeah I know
[22:07:51] <systemfault> Vorspire: What's wrong with aero?
[22:07:56] <Enginay> 513534523 hours of work on earth saved per week
[22:08:16] <Vorspire> I had to disable fading on my Aero, because it was leaving contextual artifacts on my screen
[22:08:24] <Vorspire> apparently a common bug
[22:08:27] <iszak> crap GPU?
[22:08:32] <iszak> I've never had it.
[22:08:35] <systemfault> ^^
[22:08:49] <systemfault> I also think it might be caused by a crap GPU
[22:08:51] <Vorspire> I'm running XFire, 2x HD 4650's
[22:09:03] <Enginay> hehe that's my car model
[22:09:05] <iszak> they aren't exactly crap, but maybe it's the cross fire.
[22:09:06] <systemfault> Then.. s/GPU/Driver
[22:09:12] <iszak> or that ^
[22:09:30] <iszak> I mean they are 2 gens old.
[22:09:32] <Vorspire> I'm going to go with Driver fault, because ATI's most recent update keeps failing to install :S
[22:09:42] <systemfault> But seriously.. Aero works on crap cards
[22:09:52] <Vorspire> Yea they are only budget cards, but hell, I still jizz when playing HL2 :D
[22:10:07] <Vorspire> I'm a programmer, I don't need 2 cards to start with lol
[22:10:23] <systemfault> :P
[22:10:43] <iszak> yeah, I didn't need a dual GPU either with my 5970
[22:11:07] <Enginay> I don't need a 3D accelerated video card!
[22:11:10] <Vorspire> That Aero bug only seemed to happen whenever a context menu faded out... whatever you selected would remain on the screen until you hard-refreshed the screen or w/e
[22:11:39] <systemfault> Enginay: Everyone need one nowadays :)
[22:11:47] <iszak> unfortunately.
[22:12:06] <systemfault> I prefer when my desktop is rendered with the GPU instead of the CPU
[22:12:08] <Enginay> me not, I'm using my weak card 24/7, never switching to 3D card.
[22:12:24] <Vorspire> Everyone discussing it on google results were reverting their themes back to basics/non-aero... rofl.. I just disabled fade-out on menus :/
[22:12:24] <Enginay> it is proven in practice :)
[22:14:26] <Vorspire> Hmm is it true that with xFire, the top card burns out from over-use?
[22:14:26] * black_warlock gnite peeps
[22:14:41] <Vorspire> ...or burns out faster
[22:15:03] <systemfault> I don't know :/
[22:15:32] <Vorspire> I switch them over once per month just in case :S
[22:15:50] <Vorspire> and my aero problems could be because my xFire is software and not bridged
[22:16:02] <Vorspire> meh
[22:19:38] <Vorspire> ugh the ui accordion layout is a bit blocky :S
[22:47:13] <mr_h> pakistan zindabad mon
[22:52:55] <Enginay> i need to close and re-open IE9 for it's debugger to work for the second time... after the first time it cannot select elements from the browser for me to investigate on DOM
[23:21:37] <Whirl3d> Anybody ever had a page that everything looked perfect in firebug, but nothing lots of things are missing? Even thought it says they are there and visible, they just don't display?
[23:27:08] <Zackko> anyone know of a lightbox with pan and zoom?
[23:34:25] <Zackko> ?
[23:38:49] <cod34d1> hello
[23:39:02] <Zackko> helllo
[23:39:38] <xDROPx> Zackko why do you want a lightbox with pan and zoom?
[23:40:49] <Zackko> im creating the ability for users to view the Menu's for each restaurant on a restaurant site. it would be nice if they could click on "view menu", then it would come up with "page 1,2,3 etc" and b able to zoom and pan if they are on a small screen and cant read the print
[23:40:49] <djQuery> thought the whole point of a lightbox was to open it full screen
[23:44:46] <Zackko> yes it is, but if they are using like a net book, it wont be big enough to read
[23:44:57] <xDROPx> i've used this: http://www.cabel.name/2008/02/fancyzoom-10.html
[23:45:12] <Zackko> and menus can be quite large, so you cant assume the user can read an entire menu on a 7" screen lol
[23:45:58] <Zackko> did you incorporate pan & zoom into it?
[23:46:12] <xDROPx> no
[23:46:42] <Zackko> i wonder how difficult it would be
[23:47:17] <djQuery> dont most 7" screens have a zoom feature built in?
[23:47:43] <xDROPx> i would avoid pan and zoom and just open a new page for the user with the menu - then they can use the back button to go back, that's a more cross-browser/device friendly way to do it
[23:47:50] <Zackko> perhaps but i dont think it would resample the image, so it would be pixelated
[23:48:20] <Zackko> that doesnt really help though, because the image will still be too small on smaller screens, even if you open it on a new page
[23:48:47] <Zackko> and most lightboxes are crossbrowser
[23:49:06] <xDROPx> yeah - but to your point about netbooks, what about phones?
[23:50:24] <xDROPx> i know lightboxes still work on webkit based mobiles, but that's just a challenging user experience
[23:50:35] <Zackko> good point
[23:50:59] <Zackko> should i just give them a pdf download and call it a day? haha
[23:51:05] <xDROPx> yes
[23:51:09] <xDROPx> seriously
[23:51:29] <Zackko> ok, any experience with generating a pdf from images serverside?
[23:51:42] <xDROPx> what language are you using
[23:51:46] <Zackko> php
[23:52:19] <xDROPx> well i was just using this from ruby: http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/
[23:52:50] <Engina> first time in my life i wrote a code with a special case for a browser
[23:52:51] <xDROPx> looks like they have php instructions: http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/wiki/IntegrationWithPhp
[23:52:51] <Engina> i feel tainted
[23:53:01] <xDROPx> haha
[23:53:51] <Zackko> thats cool...ill def read into tht
[23:54:02] <xDROPx> cool
