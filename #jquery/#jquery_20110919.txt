[00:01:22] <ajpiano> FreeChoice: yes
[00:01:32] <ajpiano> Cork: i don't follow
[00:01:43] <ajpiano> Cork: set document.domain on both places, end of story
[00:01:49] <ajpiano> proceed as normal....
[00:02:07] <Cork> ajpiano: how would you set document.domain on sub2 if your only doing ajax call from sub1 to sub2?
[00:02:34] <ajpiano> by putting <script>document.domain = "domain.org"</script> on sub2
[00:02:39] <ajpiano> and sub1
[00:02:48] <Cork> but what should load it?
[00:03:07] <ajpiano> huh?
[00:03:09] <Cork> throug the ajax connection?
[00:03:37] <ajpiano> huh?
[00:03:54] <Cork> ajpiano: if everything you do happend on sub1, you never load a page from sub2
[00:04:05] <Cork> that means the first thing you do is call xhr on sub2
[00:04:09] <Cork> it will be blocked
[00:04:19] <ajpiano> what in blazes are you talking about
[00:04:37] <ajpiano> oh
[00:04:38] <ajpiano> hm
[00:04:40] <ajpiano> i see what you're asking
[00:05:03] <Cork> i'm still trying to figure out how to not beeing forced to use iframes for cross sub domain ajax calls
[00:05:14] <Cork> cause, i seriusly don't see how it would be...
[00:05:27] <Cork> + posible
[00:05:38] <ajpiano> yea most of the techniques do involve iframes
[00:06:12] <ajpiano> not that there's anything wrong with that
[00:07:34] <Cork> ya, but until csp is fully supported in all browsers, its often best to use sub folders in the same sub domain is posible
[00:08:04] <Cork> (actually made me a bit sad, when i found that out)
[00:08:13] <ajpiano> mike817: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/35846480/Grid-WorkReports
[00:08:29] <ProLoser|Work> hello aj
[00:10:02] <ajpiano> whoops
[00:10:09] <ajpiano> mike__b https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/grid
[00:10:39] <ajpiano> and the link i just posted above
[00:14:20] <ProLoser|Work> i can't figure out why the tmpl() isn't working in one place for me
[00:14:30] <ProLoser|Work> i'm getting an error saying c.tmpl is not a function
[00:40:55] <n3rddotnet> i am sitll lost
[00:41:09] <n3rddotnet> anybody here that can show me some ways of doing cross subdomain webservice calls?
[00:43:04] <Cork> n3rddotnet: you need to reply with the http header listed in the control access page i listed above
[00:44:40] <Cork> n3rddotnet: ontop of that you need chrome or firefox 4+
[00:45:21] <Cork> i think it was added in something like chrome 14 or something like that
[00:46:54] <gauravs> Is there any reason frequent $.ajax calls would not invoke the finish function?
[00:48:06] <n3rddotnet> Cork, that page doesn't really help me with anything
[00:48:19] <n3rddotnet> Cork, I have firefox 6
[00:48:26] <n3rddotnet> nvm, 3.6
[00:48:33] <n3rddotnet> let me download firefox 4
[00:49:17] <gauravs> oops, I meant the complete function, not finish
[00:49:51] <Cork> gauravs: check the error console
[00:50:02] <Cork> could be it crashes for some reason
[00:50:34] <gauravs> Cork: I was looking through, and there doesn't seem to be anything related to the complete function in there
[00:50:43] <gauravs> It gets  through the success callback
[00:50:49] <gauravs> but never reaches complete
[00:50:57] <n3rddotnet> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cross-domain/
[00:50:58] <n3rddotnet> wtf
[00:51:26] <Cork> n3rddotnet: its not an extension
[00:51:33] <n3rddotnet> what am i suppose to do?
[00:51:39] <Cork> its an http header, the server sends
[00:51:40] <n3rddotnet> why the hell does browser company make this shit so hard
[00:52:06] <Cork> n3rddotnet: cause it could be a big security problem if it wasn't locked down
[00:52:17] <gauravs> Cork: I stepped through the callbacks, and after the success function I get to the 'finally' statement of the jQuery resolveWith function
[00:52:21] <Cork> thats actaully why it was locked down to start with
[00:52:22] <n3rddotnet> yah, but it's freaking hard for developing right now
[00:52:30] <Cork> n3rddotnet: i know
[00:52:52] <n3rddotnet> is there any browser that allow this?
[00:53:05] <Cork> n3rddotnet: csp is the best you got
[00:53:05] <n3rddotnet> ok, i found some iframe tutorial
[00:53:15] <Cork> that actaully let you losen the block
[00:53:29] <Cork> all other browsers block it straight off
[00:53:30] <Cork> -f
[00:53:35] <n3rddotnet> how do i change csp?
[00:53:44] <Cork> the header i linked to
[00:54:00] <Cork> ?mdc access control @ n3rddotnet
[00:54:01] <bot-t> n3rddotnet, HTTP access control - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control
[00:54:06] <n3rddotnet> i am on that pag
[00:54:07] <n3rddotnet> page
[00:54:28] <n3rddotnet> there isn't anything that automatically does this? i am a web programmer, not a security hacker -_-
[00:54:43] <Cork> the server has to allow it
[00:55:02] <n3rddotnet> server allows it
[00:55:02] <Cork> the web client can't invoke it, that would make it pointless
[00:55:13] <Cork> n3rddotnet: not unless it sends the header
[00:55:15] <n3rddotnet> i am pulling same information on android and iPhone
[00:55:25] <n3rddotnet> same freaking webservice request
[00:55:30] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control#Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[00:56:11] <n3rddotnet> ok
[00:56:13] <n3rddotnet> thanks
[00:56:17] <n3rddotnet> let me try that
[00:56:47] <n3rddotnet> and if i want to hack somebody's webservice
[00:57:05] <n3rddotnet> i dont need browser to do it, i can just write a script that's keep hitting your service on terminal
[00:57:20] <n3rddotnet> this doesn't even make sense
[00:57:27] <Cork> it does
[00:57:52] <Cork> you've forgot you can inject scripts in a webpage
[00:58:26] <Cork> that means a webpage could leak information the user or the host don't want to leak if xss is allowed
[00:58:52] <gauravs> n3rddotnet: writing a script to keep hitting a service isn't the same as injecting code in a webpage to steal a user's information
[00:58:57] <ProLoser|Work> hello
[00:59:00] <n3rddotnet> but i can inject it under same web service anyway
[00:59:20] <Cork> n3rddotnet: you have the website too, it is the client
[00:59:20] <n3rddotnet> gauravs, how do i steal user's information?
[00:59:43] <Cork> n3rddotnet: you could ex. inject a script in your bank page stealing your login information
[01:00:43] <n3rddotnet> yah, but that's when i already logged in
[01:00:46] <n3rddotnet> on my own browser
[01:00:56] <n3rddotnet> and if i m dumb enough to download a plugin that does that
[01:01:04] <Cork> don't have to be a plugin
[01:01:23] <n3rddotnet> who else can inject a javascript code on a page that i am loading?
[01:02:00] <gauravs> n3rddotnet: Off the top of my head, I could think of a case where some malicious script has been loaded on the page and sends the data it steals from the page to the malicious user's own server
[01:02:24] <gauravs> which would be on a different origin
[01:04:01] <gauravs> Although I'm no security expert, that's the simplistic way I've understood it
[01:05:07] <n3rddotnet> same can be said on mobile devices
[01:05:19] <n3rddotnet> i can access my webservice fine through all mobile devices except for web
[01:05:25] <n3rddotnet> i m not in security either...
[01:05:36] <n3rddotnet> need to hire someone good at this
[01:09:59] <n3rddotnet> Cork, i see a lot of examples using iframe
[01:10:04] <n3rddotnet> is that another way of doing this?
[01:11:33] <ravenzz> uhm
[01:11:46] <ravenzz> n3rddotnet what are you trying to achieve?
[01:17:26] <ravenzz> n3rddotnet this http://jsfiddle.net/sqqAH/ ?
[01:18:56] <discorpia> ravenzz: hmm, i thought ajax() calls were limited to the same domain as the originating page? has .ajax() always worked with any url?
[01:19:08] <ravenzz> no
[01:19:37] <discorpia> ravenzz: is there no sandboxing/permissions to change to be able to make cross domain ajax calls?
[01:21:23] <ravenzz> yes on the server-side you should set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to whatever you want, in my fiddle i allowed jsfiddle.net
[01:21:49] <ravenzz> sorry for my horrible engl.
[01:23:33] <discorpia> ravenzz: thank you, i didn't know about that http header. i thought it was a limitation in the client, more or less like cookies, that it was locked to the same domain as the originall script. thanks!
[01:24:21] <ravenzz> uhm
[01:25:36] <Guest16696> hey
[01:25:38] <Guest16696> can you help me?
[01:26:46] <squeakytoy> i just came online to say that jquery is better than sex
[01:27:21] <squeakytoy> might be an odd and random comment, but i stand behind that statement
[01:27:24] <Guest16696> wtf?
[01:27:29] <squeakytoy> Yupp.
[01:27:32] <Guest16696> Can someone help me with jquery?
[01:27:50] <Guest16696> I want an input box, that dynamicly changes it weight
[01:28:06] <Guest16696> But if you insert 2 lines, it extends
[01:28:42] <squeakytoy> it weight?
[01:28:58] <squeakytoy> what do you mean with extends
[01:30:15] <Guest16696> 'weight' value
[01:31:23] <squeakytoy> font-weight?
[01:31:24] <ravenzz> discorpia basically It is, because you can't set your Origin header to fool the server, like hey foo.com/aboutme/ I am foo.com too gimme that page
[01:31:38] <ravenzz> you must allow the client from the server-side
[01:32:39] <Guest16696> what do you mean?
[01:33:16] <gsanghani> I'm having this strange problem where the 'done' function used by $.ajax to is not fully executing. I've traced my code to the 'success' callback function. After it leaves 'success' however, instead of going back into 'done' and finishing up, it sorta just returns and doesn't execute that code anymore
[01:33:43] <ravenzz> ?demo @ gsanghani
[01:33:43] <bot-t> gsanghani, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:34:20] <gsanghani> Oh, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with jQuery. I just don't know what could possibly cause that to happen...
[01:34:45] <ravenzz> yep
[01:34:50] <ravenzz> let's debug it
[01:34:53] <beasty> morning
[01:35:07] <beasty> i'm pondering if there is anything changed in the firefox ?
[01:35:39] <squeakytoy> thats a really "wide" question
[01:35:50] <discorpia> ravenzz: thanks for the explanation, really appreciated
[01:35:55] <ravenzz> they replaced the fox with a cat because of the economic crisis
[01:36:02] <beasty> hah
[01:36:16] <beasty> no i'm having some problems since upgrading to ff 6.x.x
[01:36:25] <beasty> that when i try to load a remote javascript
[01:36:30] <beasty> i always get an error
[01:36:48] <beasty> or the http://... gets replaced by the current server adres
[01:40:08] <gsanghani> hmm, I guess my problem is too hard to explain/debug w/o something more concrete
[01:40:17] <gsanghani> I'll see if I can wrangle something up
[01:57:29] <jomofcw> Hello !
[01:57:51] <jomofcw> I have a A element in a TD element. I want the click on the TD element to bubble to the A element, how to please ?
[01:59:06] <aaronmcadam> jomofcw you could just refer to the <a> within the td click handler
[01:59:42] <Cork> jomofcw: it doesn't bubble in that direction, but ya, you can trigger a click on the a element from the td
[02:00:08] <Cork> jomofcw: just don't forget to stopPropagation's in the a's click event, or you will end up in a click loop
[02:00:56] <Cork> jomofcw: on top of that, remember that you can't trigger link clicks this way, the browser won't trigger default actions on a tags
[02:03:08] <jomofcw> Cork OK thanks I'll try it !
[02:03:14] <boopaloop> is it a good idea if developing a new plugin to use $.widget over the traditional design patern?
[02:03:31] <jomofcw> Cork hm, so I have better to make the A element fill the TD element...
[02:03:40] <Cork> yes
[02:04:18] <Cork> its so you can't fake user clicks thats why they don't allow to do it through js
[02:05:26] <jomofcw> Cork yea that's a security thing, it's right. Thanks.
[02:36:51] <anli_> How do I get the coordinates of a mouse click relative the parent of the clicked object?
[02:37:16] <phobia> hi :) I'm stuck with some jsonp attempts; I'm getting an "missing variable name" error on the response. Any thoughts on what may be causing this? Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/qmX7qRek
[02:44:40] <aleray> hi, what are the pro and con of develloping a jquery ui widget plugin rather than a regular jquery plugin?
[03:03:46] <ProLoser|Work> how do i refer to an attribute using the string value of a variable?
[03:03:53] <ProLoser|Work> like object.$whatever = something
[03:21:39] <juha_> ugh i hate it when i don't remember that "class" is reserved name and then the browser gives this bizarre error message "unknown message reserved_word", well fuck, can't you tell me what the word is, even though pointing to correct row.. ugh
[03:23:45] <aaronmcadam> juha_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words
[03:24:17] <aaronmcadam> usually IE that breaks on them
[03:27:26] <juha_> aaronmcadam: my point was that would be cool that the browser would give the reserved word on the error message already, would speed up debug
[03:27:38] <aaronmcadam> yesyes
[03:28:25] <aaronmcadam> Firefox gives me
[03:28:25] <aaronmcadam> SyntaxError: class is a reserved identifier
[03:28:44] <juha_> sweet, hopefully chrome would implement that aswell
[03:29:28] <aaronmcadam> ha
[03:29:35] <aaronmcadam> looks like chrome dev tools
[03:29:39] <aaronmcadam> doesn't even error
[03:29:53] <juha_> which version?
[03:29:56] <aaronmcadam> var class = 'bla'
[03:30:07] <aaronmcadam> class returns 'bla'
[03:30:21] <aaronmcadam> 12.0.742.112
[03:30:38] <aaronmcadam> 12.0.742.112 (90304) Built on Ubuntu 11.04, running on LinuxMint 11
[03:31:15] <aaronmcadam> it should be erroring
[03:33:04] <juha_> atleast my 14.0.835.163 (nice version number, my favorite) gave out some error
[03:33:33] <aaronmcadam> ah
[03:33:39] <aaronmcadam> I'm on chromium
[03:34:47] <aaronmcadam> shouldn't be much difference
[03:35:18] <aaronmcadam> dunno why it's out by 2 versions tho
[03:36:51] <juha_> i noticed yesterday that my chromium at home was at version 11.something
[03:39:40] <blackspotwiggins> chromiums dont autoupdate
[03:40:22] <aaronmcadam> yes
[03:40:23] <aaronmcadam> I know
[03:40:31] <aaronmcadam> seems there is an updater but looks like windows only
[03:40:59] <blackspotwiggins> just use unstable channel of chrome
[03:41:38] <aaronmcadam> it's alright
[03:41:56] <aaronmcadam> stable 12.x package works fine at the moment
[03:42:15] <blackspotwiggins> so does firefox 4 prolly
[03:42:24] <blackspotwiggins> it's nice to be on the current release tho :)
[03:42:41] <aaronmcadam> i could just install chrome
[03:43:18] <aaronmcadam> which i'm doing right now ha
[03:45:51] <juha_> i installed canary yesterday
[03:46:00] <aaronmcadam> anything of note?
[03:46:25] <juha_> "tab opening plus sign" icon looks a bit wird
[03:46:28] <juha_> weird
[03:46:42] <aaronmcadam> what platform u on
[03:47:17] <juha_> and when you open new tab, you have the most visited, apps and bookmarks, which seems to be bit different (could be that it's on current also)
[03:47:21] <juha_> mac osx
[03:48:15] <juha_> hmm, when i open new tab, i can't see my bookmarks on the first view :( badbadbad
[03:48:20] <aaronmcadam> hmm just installed chrome beta channel
[03:48:45] <TheCode> is there a way to limit the split range in 'user-yahoo-mania'.split('-') <-- I want to extract 'yahoo-mania'
[03:48:55] <aaronmcadam> right so juha_ I get type: "unexpected_reserved"
[03:49:00] <aaronmcadam> in dev tools now
[03:49:18] <aaronmcadam> still not as useful as firebug's
[03:49:19] <iivvoo> is there a way to load / "inject" jquery into a page without assining to window.jQuery or $ but a different variable in stead?
[03:49:30] <iivvoo> without modifying jquery source that is
[03:49:33] <aaronmcadam> ?noConflict @ iivvoo
[03:49:33] <bot-t> iivvoo, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[03:49:48] <iivvoo> aaronmcadam interesting, I knew there was some option
[03:49:53] <aaronmcadam> var mycrazyjQueries = jQuery.noConflict()
[03:50:09] <quicksilver> he wants .noConflict(true)
[03:50:16] <aaronmcadam> so then you can do mycrazyjQueries('#crazyId').find()....
[03:50:16] <quicksilver> if he really wants to clear up jQuery as well
[03:50:28] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[03:50:40] <aaronmcadam> instead of aliasing it, replacing it completely
[03:50:48] <juha_> i think that jquery should by default change jQuery to yayQuery on noConflict
[03:50:57] <quicksilver> juha_: that would break all plugins.
[03:51:05] <juha_> quicksilver: that would be cool
[03:51:07] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[03:51:12] <quicksilver> ok :)
[03:51:18] <aaronmcadam> it should break and cornify by default :D
[03:51:34] <juha_> aaronmcadam: also it shoul shoot rainbows out of our usb's
[03:51:50] <aaronmcadam> USB 3 recommended*
[03:53:30] <juha_> btw, anyone found any settings on chrome and incognito windows? i hate it when i open one, then another, the second one has cookies from the first one..
[03:53:58] <iivvoo> seems to work fine, though I need to check if a possible other jquery that's using $ is restored
[03:54:31] <iivvoo> (imagine a plugin that injects jquery into each page because it depends on it, but the page itself may already have loaded some version of jquery)
[03:55:07] <juha_> is it a jquery plugin or generic plugin?
[03:55:35] <xec> rainbows? can you do that with javascript?
[03:55:42] <juha_> yes
[03:55:46] <xec> awesome
[03:55:51] <xec> i want
[03:56:02] <juha_> document.rainbowify();
[03:56:39] <xec> TypeError: document.rainbowify is not a function
[03:56:55] <xec> maybe i need to download a new javascript
[03:56:55] <juha_> WOOT
[03:57:07] <juha_> Please reinstall internet.
[03:57:20] <xec> can i find the internet on google?
[03:59:00] <aaronmcadam> iivvoo: that's not the normal pattern for jq plugins tho
[03:59:01] <juha_> altavista
[03:59:14] <juha_> Altavista it!
[03:59:18] <iivvoo> aaronmcadam not a jq plugin
[03:59:23] <iivvoo> more like a firefox extension
[03:59:31] <aaronmcadam> ah like jQuerify
[03:59:36] <aaronmcadam> part of firebug now tho
[03:59:42] <aaronmcadam> well that was a bookmarklet originally
[03:59:52] <iivvoo> actually, if you need to know, python code using webkit accessing JSContext
[03:59:53] <aaronmcadam> it did a noConflict
[04:00:12] <aaronmcadam> ooh headless browser testing?
[04:00:24] <juha_> iivvoo: imho if you're doing a generic plugin, you shouldn't be using jQuery or other libraries as it may fuck stuff up
[04:00:36] <aaronmcadam> juha_++
[04:00:49] <aaronmcadam> it should be a stated dependency really
[04:01:15] <iivvoo> nah, I just need to manipulate the dom of pages loaded into the webkit frame
[04:01:21] <iivvoo> and without jquery it's rather primitive
[04:01:44] <iivvoo> I'd rather access the dom directly from python but that's not supported (yet)
[04:01:50] <juha_> I had unicornify.com, where i had a chat plugin that was crossdomain, i built it on top of jquery and then made sure that people would also have jquery on their site
[04:04:57] <is_null> hi all, is templating part of jquery yet ? i can only find plugins ...
[04:05:25] <is_null> ie. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/ -> Categories: Plugins > Templates
[04:11:50] <aaronmcadam> is_null: nope
[04:12:06] <aaronmcadam> and it probably won't be
[04:15:04] <MoTiOnXml> \o all
[04:15:06] <MoTiOnXml> monday again and all
[04:15:32] <aaronmcadam> yep
[04:15:52] <aaronmcadam> haven't written a line of js yet today :(
[04:16:31] <MoTiOnXml> yea, me too
[04:16:39] <MoTiOnXml> lots of planning tho'
[04:16:53] <aaronmcadam> I'm sorting a bloody email template
[04:16:59] <aaronmcadam> so crap
[04:17:10] <MoTiOnXml> CSS?
[04:17:24] <MoTiOnXml> or wait, mail clients are really bad at CSS
[04:19:21] <is_null> thanks for answering aaronmcadam
[04:20:02] <aaronmcadam> no worries
[04:20:07] <aaronmcadam> jqtmpl is decent
[04:20:23] <aaronmcadam> underscore's is good too
[04:20:34] <aaronmcadam> not used mustache, but meant to be a good choice as well
[04:45:26] <StPiere> is jquery-ui free for use in commercial web sites ?
[04:51:28] <johnline3> lol yes
[04:51:28] <ibc> hi, let me an easy question please
[04:52:06] <ibc> I want to add a "hover" effect to each menu entry, so I init the JS function as follows:
[04:52:50] <ibc> $("#head-menu div a").hover(function() {
[04:52:50] <ibc> it correctly select each menu item but then, how I use the current menu item? I expected something like:
[04:52:50] <ibc> self.css("background-color","#BBFF00");
[04:52:50] <ibc> but this does not work
[04:53:17] <johnline3> this.css
[04:53:32] <ibc> ah ok, so easy :)
[04:54:49] <ibc> hum, I must be doing something wrong:
[04:54:49] <ibc>   $("#head-menu div a").hover(function() {
[04:54:49] <ibc>     this.css("background-color","#BBFF00");
[04:54:49] <ibc>   });
[04:54:49] <ibc> I get an error:
[04:54:49] <ibc> Uncaught TypeError: Object file:///home/ibc/web/index.html# has no method 'css'
[04:55:11] <juha_> ibc: wrap it in jquery object, $(this)
[04:55:24] <johnline3> oh yes sorry my bad
[04:55:43] <ibc> great :)
[04:55:46] <ibc> thanks a lot
[04:56:07] <juha_> the parking lot is glad to be of service.
[05:06:09] <topriddy> hello people. please i want to select a tr but exempt a td.  I mean i want to write a click function fo  jQuery('table tbody tr'). but a td in the row must be exempted from the behaviour. what do i do?
[05:07:16] <topriddy> hello?
[05:21:24] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[05:21:36] <Double_Rainbow> anyone can help me with this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/xvNRq/
[05:21:57] <Double_Rainbow> tell me why when i remove 1 day from 31/dec/2011, it becomes 30 sept?
[05:24:09] <blackspotwiggins> Double_Rainbow, you are not removing one day from 31/12/2011
[05:24:33] <blackspotwiggins> you are setting the date to be 30 on another date object, which might have random month/year value
[05:24:52] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: sure i am, check this one: http://jsfiddle.net/ktBVT/
[05:25:21] <blackspotwiggins> newDate is not 31/12/2011
[05:25:26] <blackspotwiggins> dont assume it is
[05:25:46] <Double_Rainbow> but how then....
[05:25:49] <topriddy> hello people. please i want to select a tr but exempt a td.  I mean i want to write a click function fo  jQuery('table tbody tr'). but a td in the row must be exempted from the behaviour. what do i do?
[05:25:57] <blackspotwiggins> look at what setDate does for starters
[05:26:37] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: DOH!!\
[05:27:54] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: but then, how do i do it?
[05:31:54] <blackspotwiggins> Double_Rainbow, read the documentation on Date objects.
[05:34:15] <aaronmcadam> ?mdn
[05:34:16] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Namespaced Events - jQuery provides a system for namespacing bound events for easier triggering and removal. Namespaced events were added in jQuery 1.2. http://docs.jquery.com/Namespaced_Events
[05:34:20] <aaronmcadam> ?mdc date
[05:34:20] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Date - MDN - Creates Date instances which let you work with dates and times. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[05:34:57] <Double_Rainbow> aaronmcadam: that link was not helpful
[05:35:23] <aaronmcadam> haha
[05:35:25] <aaronmcadam> it's the docs
[05:35:44] <aaronmcadam> MDN is the best js doc source out there
[05:38:51] <Double_Rainbow> the best solution i see, convert the date from string to milliseconds,. remove a day from those milliseconds and convert it back to date
[05:39:06] <aaronmcadam> why?
[05:39:14] <aaronmcadam> what are you doing?
[05:39:22] <blackspotwiggins> Double_Rainbow, yea that seems ok
[05:39:45] <aaronmcadam> can you get the epoch yeah
[05:39:46] <blackspotwiggins> the most reliable without having to mess around with leap years/timezones/etc
[05:41:20] <Double_Rainbow> aaronmcadam: i do not get it, what is epoch?
[05:41:36] <aaronmcadam> the amount of time passed since 1st jan 1970
[05:41:46] <Double_Rainbow> yeah, so?
[05:41:49] <aaronmcadam> common unix time
[05:42:19] <aaronmcadam> nevermind
[05:48:29] <Double_Rainbow> OH MY FUCKING GOD, I GET IT NOW @ aaronmcadam
[05:48:37] <Double_Rainbow>     var date = new Date("12/31/2011");
[05:48:37] <Double_Rainbow>     var newDate =new Date( date.getTime() - 86400000 );
[05:48:38] <Double_Rainbow>     alert(newDate);
[05:48:38] <aaronmcadam> :O
[05:49:05] <blackspotwiggins> wow, you want a freakin medal?
[05:49:09] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[05:49:26] <aaronmcadam> there's also that cool time plugin that got released
[05:49:28] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: everyone was a stupid NOOB, even you
[05:49:32] <blackspotwiggins> nope
[05:51:10] <devians> is it possible to change the context when using $.trigger ? ie some way i can use $.proxy to change this within the closure trigger executes?
[05:52:34] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: you were born a genius?
[05:52:44] <raver> hi all: http://jsfiddle.net/WeDZQ/ this code gives me the error:  $("#UserRegisterForm").validate is not a function .. any idea why, function is included as you can see on fiddle
[05:53:10] <blackspotwiggins> Double_Rainbow, i was not. but i did learn basics on my own
[05:53:44] <blackspotwiggins> i didnt go ask someone else the minute i encountered something new/unknown
[05:53:56] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: so you were a noob, learnt the basics and now you are no longer noob?
[05:54:27] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: so you prefer to strive 5hrs on a problem rather than asking for help on an IRC?
[05:54:32] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[05:54:45] <blackspotwiggins> if it takes 5h to find documentation for date object...
[05:54:50] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: remind me not to hire you as a programmer
[05:54:53] <blackspotwiggins> well, programming is not for everyone
[05:55:30] <pachet> who are we kidding
[05:55:31] <pachet> this is jq
[05:55:34] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, go hire people who dont know shit and spam irc with their stupid questions
[05:55:41] <pachet> very rarely does the conversation venture into what could be deemed programmatic
[05:55:48] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: go read that noob http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/08/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful.html
[05:55:55] <jarrod322> hi everyone!
[05:56:27] <jarrod322> i look for something like "add an image to basket" idea to be able to click images and display them in a div together
[05:56:33] <jarrod322> what could i use for such functionality
[05:56:39] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: quote: "Most of all, that means not being afraid to ask the stupid questions:"
[05:56:40] <jarrod322> essentially its a add to basket feature?
[05:57:25] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[05:57:31] <blackspotwiggins> so what does that mean? i could write a blog post saying the exact opposite
[05:57:35] <aaronmcadam> you're so being trolled Double_Rainbow and totally falling for it
[05:57:39] <aaronmcadam> :D
[05:58:01] <blackspotwiggins> i mean herp, how do i jquery my imageloaders
[05:58:03] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: YOU are not Jeff Atwood, the creator of Stackoverflow
[05:58:19] <topriddy> hello
[05:58:26] <devians> im confused as to who is trolling who now
[05:58:33] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[05:58:42] <aaronmcadam> let's troll each other devians
[05:58:46] <Double_Rainbow> aaronmcadam: http://xkcd.com/386/
[05:58:51] <devians> Double_Rainbow: Jeff Atwood is not some kind of programming god. just pointing that out
[05:59:07] <topriddy> please how would a jQuery selector to select and add an onClick event on a tr look like while exempting one of the columns a td with a class exempt
[05:59:14] <devians> aaronmcadam: i'd be happier if someone answered my question? :)
[05:59:20] <aaronmcadam> spit it
[05:59:32] <devians> is it possible to change the context when using $.trigger ? ie some way i can use $.proxy to change this within the closure trigger executes?
[05:59:43] <Double_Rainbow> blackspotwiggins: what have you done so far in life noob?
[05:59:56] <aaronmcadam> ritght
[06:00:05] <blackspotwiggins> Double_Rainbow, well, i found out how to use google. i think.
[06:00:07] <topriddy> anybody?
[06:00:11] <aaronmcadam> hmm have you tired devians?
[06:00:15] <aaronmcadam> haha
[06:00:55] <blackspotwiggins> devians, i don't think so, you need to bind with proxy to begin with
[06:00:56] <jarrod322> any of you experts know some jquery function or plugin that lets you select items and display an image in a div ?
[06:00:56] <aaronmcadam> sorry *tried
[06:01:06] <jarrod322> a visual drag an drop jquery thingy would do
[06:01:07] <aaronmcadam> ah and then trigger should work
[06:01:32] <devians> blackspotwiggins: yeah, that doesnt work for my pattern. hrm....
[06:01:56] <blackspotwiggins> other than that, store the hander away and just go handler.call(context)
[06:02:01] <blackspotwiggins> handler*
[06:02:01] <aaronmcadam> jarrod322: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=drag+and+drop+jquery+thingy
[06:02:59] <sean`> wat
[06:11:11] <MoTiOnXml> on loooooove boat (singing ..)
[06:26:41] <kul> How to load one <li> after another ? Like I want to use queue ?
[06:27:04] <rzec> is there any way to either disable the date picker or remove the date picker for an element with jQuery UI 1.7.x?
[06:29:42] <kul> how to fade in <li> (list-items) one after another ?
[06:31:18] <ccmonster> kul, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5643383/fade-in-list-items-sequentially-with-jquery
[06:31:22] <aaronmcadam> there's a callback on fadeIn
[06:31:55] <kul> thanks
[06:31:59] <kul> ccmonster
[06:32:10] <kryman> the page at the bottom seems to jump up where there aren't a longer scroll (more text on the page).
[06:32:17] <ccmonster> i would think it would be easier to list.each(function(i,item){item.delay(300).fadeIn()}) or something
[06:32:25] <kryman> the link is www.catholic-saints.net
[06:32:39] <johnline3> wont .hide() trigger too late?
[06:32:42] <aaronmcadam> but how would you know the right delay to use
[06:32:46] <aaronmcadam> it's not guaranteed
[06:32:48] <johnline3> thus you get your content flashing then fading in
[06:32:56] <aaronmcadam> I'd want to use the callbacks from fadeIn
[06:33:28] <ccmonster> yea, I'm not sure without trying it, but I think there is probably an easier solution than the link i found.
[06:33:35] <johnline3> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/client_directory/
[06:33:39] <johnline3> this is how i done it
[06:34:44] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/nWAbA/ - how do I make it so that when "Add to cart" is clicked, #dropdown_cart appears for 5 seconds and then disappears?
[06:35:41] <ccmonster> add a click event listener to #addtocart that does a #dropdown_cart.show(function(){...time stuff, then hide()})
[06:37:10] <kryman> could someone take a look on my code?
[06:37:32] <aaronmcadam> no i'm an atheist :P haha
[06:38:33] <pachet> <div class="info" style="padding:4px 10px;height:100px;font-size:90%;color:#888;">
[06:38:36] <pachet> Use this area to customize your DMS sessions.
[06:38:41] <pachet> asdf.......
[06:38:48] <kryman> that's too bad, you will go to HELL
[06:39:30] <kryman> besides, it's not my code. so I would need guidelines what to change
[06:39:54] <pachet> just out of curiousity, does the church still subscribe to the notion of a literal hell
[06:39:57] <pachet> fire and brimstone
[06:40:01] <pachet> seems so medieval
[06:40:23] <ccmonster> they've modernized. They now agree in Dante's Rings approach :)
[06:40:31] <kryman> every sinner who doesn't repent will suffer lost
[06:40:39] <red> http://jsfiddle.net/ZzPX5/4/
[06:40:47] <kryman> read our material on our site
[06:40:50] <red> why doesn't it bind?
[06:40:54] <ccmonster> that was a joke, btw.
[06:40:58] <kryman> watch our DVDs on doomsdaytube.com
[06:41:09] <muzone> Is there a nice and simple way to let users select their country from a world map like on this page? http://www.luisaviaroma.com/index.aspx?#getLogIn.aspx|CallType=CurrAndShip&action=vis&season=actual&gender=women&fromWhoCurrAndShip=0
[06:41:22] <pachet> that's alright
[06:42:25] <ccmonster> Sure muzone. I am sure there are canvas html5 world maps out there.
[06:42:57] <muzone> thanks ccmonster
[06:43:20] <muzone> ccmonster: what about http://www.gethifi.com/blog/jquery-vs-flash-for-interactive-map and http://davidlynch.org/js/maphilight/docs/demo_world.html though?
[06:45:38] <muzone> ccmonster: and then theres http://thomaspeklak.github.com/raphaeljs-worldmap/
[06:46:15] <red> "Uncaught TypeError: Object function (j,s){return new b.fn.init(j,s)} has no method 'preventDefault'"
[06:46:15] <ccmonster> I've heard about raphealjs maps
[06:46:18] <red> meh
[06:46:25] <ccmonster> they sound solid.
[06:46:36] <muzone> ccmonster: wait last one: http://jvectormap.owl-hollow.net/
[06:46:38] <ccmonster> What sort of exactness or granularity doyou need for your maps?
[06:47:35] <ccmonster> I would go with either of the last 2.
[06:47:45] <ccmonster> The last one was slick, but it's an odd looking map.
[06:47:57] <ccmonster> matter of fact, both of them are somewhat strange looking.
[06:48:22] <ccmonster> Then again, the maps we see day to day, in school systems and all that are way off, so I've been conditioned :|
[06:49:26] <muzone> haha
[06:49:33] <muzone> my thoughts exactly (about the odd looking maps)
[06:49:53] <ccmonster> Now, it looks like some of those can take a SVG map of your liking
[06:50:04] <muzone> nice
[06:50:07] <muzone> the last one?
[06:50:12] <ccmonster> so if you can grab a beter map, say the Wikipedia SVG maps, then I'd go with that
[06:50:40] <muzone> yeah those maps are really decent..
[06:51:36] <muzone> ccmonster: so jVectorMap + Wikipedia SVG maps?
[06:52:59] <ccmonster> The jvectormap looks decent.
[06:53:32] <ccmonster> However, I think you can put your own maps in, althought it doesn't say directly. Problem is, it might require you to put in a BUNCH of coordinates to get it working, and therefor might not be worth it
[06:56:25] <muzone> yeah..
[06:56:28] <muzone> good point..
[06:57:20] <federico2> hi there
[06:59:02] <federico2> $.post seems not to work if I have data to be sent *and* a success function to be executed. The function is never run as long as I'm sending data. If I remove the data variable, the success function is run.
[06:59:42] <ccmonster> well, are you returning data?
[07:00:46] <federico2> uh, there is a thread in the comments in http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ ... the post function might behave strangely with incorrect json...
[07:01:06] <blackspotwiggins> federico2, the solution is not to expect json
[07:01:12] <blackspotwiggins> or respond with correct json
[07:01:28] <whoru> Can anybody plz help me with jquery click andtoggle
[07:01:30] <whoru> toggle
[07:02:46] <whoru> http://jsfiddle.net/t5qWM/
[07:04:28] <Dave_Stein> whoru what's the issue
[07:04:36] <whoru> http://jsfiddle.net/t5qWM/
[07:04:54] <Dave_Stein> what's it supposed to do wand what's it doing
[07:05:31] <Dave_Stein> also return false is equal to e.prevenDefault + e.stopPropagation
[07:05:42] <whoru> When I click on the elem it should do an ajax call
[07:05:52] <whoru> thst working well
[07:06:05] <whoru> but clicking on it again creates one more div below it
[07:06:10] <whoru> and goes on
[07:07:20] <Dave_Stein> it looks like on every click you are doing a new textboxlist
[07:07:28] <Dave_Stein> maybe that's creating the extra div?
[07:07:49] <whoru> yes
[07:08:57] <Dave_Stein> ou shouldn't be binding the ajax call and textboxlist to same click if you want to make one happen once and the other happen everytime
[07:09:05] <Dave_Stein> you can bind to two separate callbacks, and then unbind the other
[07:09:28] <whoru> how to do that?
[07:09:53] <Dave_Stein> a bunch of different ways
[07:09:58] <Dave_Stein> ?one @ whoru
[07:09:58] <bot-t> whoru, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[07:10:52] <muzone> ccmonster: any idea what luisaviaroma did?
[07:11:13] <Dave_Stein> also you're doing async false which is bad practice
[07:11:21] <Dave_Stein> it should be on success that you do the textboxlist
[07:11:41] <ccmonster> hadn't looked.
[07:12:19] <whoru> still not getting it?
[07:12:24] <whoru> :(
[07:12:51] <ccmonster> muzone, re-send the link..?
[07:13:21] <whoru> What about toggle will it work?
[07:13:50] <Dave_Stein> you need to do an ajax call -> wait for success ( stop using async option ) -> fire a function which sets up textboxlist
[07:14:04] <Dave_Stein> and then toggle when you need it, not sure when youre trying to hide/show
[07:14:41] <gnarf> did you just suggest someone not use async?
[07:15:12] <whoru> something like this http://jsfiddle.net/ccGB8/1/
[07:15:53] <Dave_Stein> i meant he is using async : false and he shuold take that away
[07:16:30] <seutje> JAX is so uncool!
[07:16:31] <whoru> Its working now
[07:16:35] <whoru> thanks a lot
[07:16:46] <Dave_Stein> whoru you should still refactor your code
[07:16:49] <Dave_Stein> async false = hanging browser
[07:17:02] <whoru> any alternative
[07:17:14] <pachet> ;O
[07:17:15] <Dave_Stein> using callbacks properly :)
[07:17:19] <whoru> actually data is very less
[07:17:43] <Dave_Stein> back to work for me
[07:17:44] <seutje> what if connection is even lesser?
[07:17:56] <seutje> think of the dial-ups!!
[07:18:04] <whoru> its a 1KB data
[07:18:21] <seutje> ?g 1KB over a 33.4K modem
[07:18:22] <bot-t> seutje, No results found for '1KB over a 33.4K modem'.
[07:18:25] <blackspotwiggins> "data is very less" is my new favourite sentence
[07:18:27] <seutje> LIES!
[07:18:45] <whoru> as of now response size is 35B
[07:18:54] <pachet> i'll try that one at the next qa meeting
[07:19:24] <whoru> I understand the risk
[07:19:52] <blackspotwiggins> whoru, any action that takes more than 100ms is noticable
[07:20:07] <blackspotwiggins> and if you freeze your ui for undetermined time, it's rather bad
[07:20:29] <seutje> pachet: I try it every time
[07:20:31] <seutje> never works!
[07:21:18] <seutje> 1 more backend guy going "but it's cached" and I will shoot myself in the face!

[07:28:45] <scribe> Hey guys.  This is a really basic question, but I've been struggling with this for a while now.  I am parsing the result of a request for a web page.  On that page, there is a div I want to grab.  So I do $(response).find('#divid').  Now I want to inject this into an element on my page, and I can't seem to do this.  Most recent attempt was: $(response).find('#divid').clone().appendTo('#idWhereIWishToPlace');
[07:29:41] <Jon47> scribe why clone it?
[07:29:58] <Jon47> make a fiddle/paste/bin and we'll fix it for ya
[07:30:41] <scribe> thanks Jon47, I cloned it because not cloning it didn't work :)  Was just something else to try.
[07:31:39] <scribe> Jon47, I get [object Object] embedded into my page.
[07:32:04] <scribe> Jon47, I guess I need to dereference this somehow, but don't fully 'get' the jquery world yet.
[07:32:13] <Jon47> looks like you're cnoverting it to a string before appending it
[07:32:25] <Jon47> but it's hard to tell without a fiddle ;)
[07:32:43] <projmon> seutje, actually 0 was incorrect. it gets 167 after a refresh but the scrollbar havent moved, ie it should still be 516
[07:32:55] <projmon> *hasnt
[07:33:27] <projmon> whoru, sry have no idea
[07:33:47] <whoru> k

[07:33:51] <whoru> bye
[07:35:05] <pachet> projmon: what browser
[07:35:52] <projmon> chrome
[07:36:12] <projmon> in ff the value doesnt change on refresh
[07:37:01] <scribe> Jon47, Here you go: http://pastebin.com/teW9MdG6
[07:38:59] <Jon47> scribe, haven't used gadgets before, but I'd advise checking the value of "$(o.text).find('#content')" before appending it
[07:39:25] <scribe> Jon47,  thanks. o.text gives me the full webpage
[07:39:44] <scribe> Jon47, I've checked with an alert.
[07:40:11] <scribe> Jon47, That page has a div with id ='content'
[07:40:24] <Jon47> in that case, it all looks pretty good
[07:40:30] <Jon47> do you have a working example we can play with?
[07:40:31] <scribe> Jon47, not sure if I'm using jquery correctly to grab the div and inject it
[07:41:50] <projmon> is there a better way to get the scroll position than $(window).scrollTop() ?
[07:42:00] <projmon> one that works in chrome
[07:49:27] <scribe> Jon47, I'll set something public up, but it won't be pretty javascript because it will be injected into the portal framework, but I'll put some alerts in so you can see. Just a sec.  Thanks for offering to help!
[07:51:20] <pachet> projmon: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2891 there are a couple of workarounds listed
[07:56:04] <topriddy> hello.
[07:56:55] <astropirate> hi
[07:57:26] <ccmonster> hi
[08:04:22] <ccmonster> So, wassup folks?
[08:04:32] <lexflex> I am looking for a nice jQuery content slider like Nivo Slider, but it has to support content (links and text), and not only images. any ideas?
[08:05:47] <Sil4nc4_> lexflex, use http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/index.html
[08:05:53] <Sil4nc4_> check scrollable
[08:07:50] <lexflex> sil4nc4_: are you talking about 4. Scrollable?
[08:08:00] <Sil4nc4_> yes lexflex
[08:08:26] <Sil4nc4_> i have searched a long time for a good scrollable, this was the best imho
[08:08:31] <Sil4nc4_> also tried nivo slider etc
[08:20:50] <guybrush> is there a way to have selected at least 1 item with .selectable()?
[08:21:36] <gnarf> huh?
[08:22:08] <guybrush> like, before unselecting any item check if its the last one selected
[08:23:12] <guybrush> the unselecting-event fires AFTER unselecting the item
[08:23:18] <gnarf> is it cancelable tho?
[08:23:52] <gnarf> i'm not terribly familiar with the plugin, lemme go read the code
[08:23:54] <guybrush> inside the unselecting-closure?
[08:24:21] <guybrush> is there any canel-method provided inside the closure?
[08:24:26] <guybrush> dont think so :p
[08:24:47] <guybrush> what i need is a preunselecting event :D
[08:25:08] <gnarf> not nessecarilly
[08:25:34] <gnarf> you could in your unselecting event, reselect if the total selection length is 0
[08:25:42] <gnarf> right?
[08:25:45] <guybrush> hm
[08:26:27] <guybrush> well i will try, but i think the best i get with this approach is a bad user-experience
[08:26:38] <gnarf> agreed
[08:29:02] <gnarf> guybrush: also it seems that it will unselect before selecting
[08:29:38] <guybrush> i think the best way to handle this is to fit alle selectable elements into the selectable-container without gaps
[08:29:42] <gnarf> might need to deferr the check of length to the next loop
[08:29:45] <guybrush> and pre-select 1 item
[08:29:58] <gnarf> well you can still multiselect
[08:30:06] <gnarf> etc
[08:30:19] <sphinxxx> how do i attach the autocomplete function to a live event?
[08:32:20] <muzone> What's the best way to do a clickable jQuery "select your country" thing like on http://www.luisaviaroma.com/index.aspx?#getLogIn.aspx|CallType=CurrAndShip&action=vis&season=actual&gender=women using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-World6-Equirectangular.svg?
[08:32:21] <guybrush> how can i multiselect?
[08:35:48] <jinxdone> muzone, just like it's done on that page, with image-map and <area> tags
[08:36:55] <muzone> jinxdone: i see i see
[08:37:58] <ccmonster> well, muzone , you have the map script
[08:39:20] <muzone> ccmonster: but like you said i had to manually put in the coordinates for every country in the world
[08:39:34] <ccmonster> If you wanted to change the map.
[08:40:12] <ccmonster> if that map fits your fancy, which isn't bad at all, then you just handle the click event keep movign
[08:40:13] <muzone> well yeah i wanna use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-World6-Equirectangular.svg
[08:40:38] <ccmonster> do you need every country clickable? what sort of exactness do you need?
[08:40:47] <muzone> every country yes
[08:40:50] <muzone> including palestine lol
[08:41:02] <muzone> and north / south sudan
[08:42:34] <pachet> vatican city
[08:43:24] <ccmonster> In that case muzone , I'd just use that map in the script
[08:43:33] <ccmonster> It's got good granularity, and works as is.
[08:44:04] <ccmonster> The map isn't bad. I think it's a mercator projection map, which is the 'common' one we see in Developed countries, albeit inprecise.
[08:46:11] <jinxdone> google maps also has a good overlay with all the countries, if you wanted to use that
[08:46:12] <muzone> ccmonster: No - i have to use my own map
[08:46:23] <ccmonster> oh.
[08:46:27] <muzone> sorry but i just gotta
[08:46:27] <ccmonster> Which map is that ?
[08:46:32] <muzone> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-World6-Equirectangular.svg
[08:46:47] <muzone> im gonna customize it slightly ofcourse
[08:46:58] <muzone> colorwise, but yeah
[08:47:24] <ccmonster> Hm, is there any chance you could just use the google maps one? that way as the world gets 'updated' you are automatically with the times?
[08:48:14] <DarsVaeda> is there a hash function build in jquery or javascript?
[08:48:39] <muzone> ccmonster: nope its gotta be my own solution
[08:48:50] <muzone> trouble ahead huh
[08:49:13] <ccmonster> DarsVaeda, there is some param functions
[08:49:15] <ccmonster> ?param

[08:49:38] <topriddy> please how would a jQuery selector to select and add an onClick event on a tr look like while exempting one of the columns a td with a class exempt
[08:49:49] <ccmonster> Hmm muzone , isn't that your own solution if you use the api to do some stuff?
[08:50:01] <DarsVaeda> thanks but thats not what I'm looking for
[08:50:09] <gnarf> DarsVaeda: you mean like md5 / etc?
[08:50:14] <DarsVaeda> yup
[08:50:16] <gnarf> nothing builti
[08:50:19] <Echoes2> does anyone know of any lazy image loading alternatives to http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload  ?
[08:50:21] <gnarf> ?g javascript md5
[08:50:22] <bot-t> gnarf, Paj's Home: Cryptography: JavaScript MD5 - http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/
[08:50:30] <muzone> ccmonster: what do you mean?
[08:51:02] <ccmonster> Use a google maps map, and their api and you can get coutnries that way, plus let google manage the countries
[08:51:32] <topriddy> please i would like to select a tr and set a click event through jQuery, but i am not sure how to exempt a particular column (td) from this event. anybody?
[08:51:36] <muzone> ccmonster: will it allow me to do a black/white minimalist style like http://www.luisaviaroma.com/index.aspx?#getLogIn.aspx|CallType=CurrAndShip&action=vis&season=actual&gender=women&fromWhoCurrAndShip=0 though?
[08:52:12] <muzone> ccmonster: then theres the issue of palestine, which im sure google doesn't recognize
[08:52:15] <muzone> but i have to recognize it
[08:52:51] <ccmonster> topriddy, $('tr td').click(function(e){console.log('i clicked a td')})
[08:53:14] <ccmonster> I wouldn't be surprised if they DID recognize it
[08:53:30] <muzone> will they allow me to do a black/white minimalist style though?
[08:53:31] <ccmonster> or you can draw out the 1963/9 lines out automatically to the map
[08:53:40] <ccmonster> Probably muzone. You can color things any way you want I presume
[08:53:47] <gnarf> topriddy: if ( $(event.target).is("td:nth-child(2)") ) return; ?
[08:54:08] <gnarf> that should skip the 2nd td (or maybe the third, i can never remember
[08:54:08] <topriddy> ccmonster: i want to exempt a td in the row from the click event. ie i dont want the td to have an onclick event.
[08:54:24] <topriddy> gnarf: would try that out.
[08:54:36] <Brodingo> ben_alman if you got a ps3 http://www.joystiq.com/2011/09/16/ni-no-kuni-coming-to-north-america-early-next-year/
[08:54:54] <ben_alman> oh weird
[08:54:55] <ben_alman> neat
[08:54:57] <gnarf> topriddy: you might need to .closest( "td" ) before the .is()
[08:55:00] <ben_alman> i do have a ps3
[08:55:07] <ben_alman> but only use it for netflix and blu rays
[08:55:37] <ben_alman> i'll keep my eyes open tho
[08:56:10] <aaronmcadam> think n is 0 indexed
[08:56:29] <ccmonster> yup aaronmcadam , i think thats right
[08:57:07] <aaronmcadam> actually nope
[08:57:08] <aaronmcadam>  the value of n is "1-indexed",
[08:57:32] <aaronmcadam> it's eq() that's 0-indexed
[08:57:57] <aaronmcadam> from the docs, it's cuz they follow the css spec for nth-child
[09:02:36] <ccmonsters> http://www.daftlogic.com/sandbox-click-for-country.htm
[09:02:39] <ccmonsters> muzone,
[09:02:53] <ccmonsters> just take that, plus change the map type, and throw a layer on and you're set.
[09:05:30] <muzone> ccmonsters: i dont know im kinda skeptic towards this
[09:06:01] <muzone> what map types do i have to choose between, and what you mean by a layer?
[09:06:17] <muzone> cakehero ;)
[09:06:27] <muzone> sup
[09:06:27] <ccmonsters> google maps have things call layers.
[09:06:38] <ccmonsters> basically you can overlay things on the maps
[09:07:08] <cakehero> muzone sup dawg
[09:07:21] <muzone> ccmonsters: but again i just want a minimalist black/white map with no drawn borders. no zoom in/out and no google logo / copyright notices..
[09:07:31] <muzone> ive written to the google maps mailinglist though asking for help
[09:07:39] <ccmonsters> Ok
[09:07:40] <muzone> same with raphael.js and to the jvectormap author
[09:08:09] <muzone> cakehero: trying to do a clickable world map like http://www.luisaviaroma.com/index.aspx?#getLogIn.aspx|CallType=CurrAndShip&action=vis&season=actual&gender=women&fromWhoCurrAndShip=0
[09:08:13] <muzone> shit is hard though
[09:08:49] <ccmonsters> It's hard if you need an exact solution like you are striving for. It's easy if you can have a few concessions
[09:10:22] <Bower^> Hey. My little site has a search bar that queries some web API and outputs the live results into some div. It does kinda work but each char input triggers a call to the API so it can get a bit "jolty". I need to change it so that the API is called once the user has stopped typing stuff in after a given duration (perhaps a second). Any general thoughts on how I might implement this? I basically need some function that constantly loops on the condition of "has
[09:10:22] <Bower^> a second passed yet" and until then it just listens to user input with some element and resets the time if it detects within that second. Yeah I'm having terrible tunnel vision so any general thoughts however obvious they may seem would be appreciated
[09:10:30] <Bower^> Sorry for the wall of text :D
[09:11:03] <ajpiano> Bower^: see ?debounce
[09:11:03] <bot-t> Bower^, Ben Alman  jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[09:12:02] <cakehero> ccmonsters whats the exact solution he's looking for?
[09:12:27] <cakehero> muzone http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/world-map ?
[09:13:00] <Bower^> Interesting
[09:13:14] <cakehero> muzone look at his codez0rs
[09:13:24] <ajpiano> Bower^: it's more than just interesting, it's the answer to your problem
[09:13:59] <muzone> cakehero: yeah i guess
[09:14:15] <muzone> cakehero: i gotta use a different map though so i'd have to redo most of it, but yeah it is my best bet so far
[09:14:19] <Bower^> Well yeah, interesting in that sense
[09:16:48] <Bower^> Cheers ajpiano
[09:16:52] <Bower^> damn jquery is sweet
[09:19:09] <ccmonsters> :)
[09:20:29] <SEJeff_work> What makes el.preventDefault() better than return false?
[09:22:02] <erichynds> SEJeff_work: return false also prevents the event from bubbling
[09:22:10] <erichynds> preventDefault does not
[09:22:45] <SEJeff_work> erichynds, bubbling? Meaning propagating upwards? Can you give an example somewhere please?
[09:22:51] <Ogredude> ok, I want to bind a handler to a particular <option> within a <select>.  Which event am I looking for?
[09:22:56] <sphinxxx> preventDefault allows code to run after it, but it justs stops the default functionality of the element
[09:22:59] <erichynds> SEJeff_work: yes, propagation upwards.
[09:23:20] <pudger> It doesn't matter, cuz I won't go away... yeah!
[09:23:20] <SEJeff_work> sphinxxx, Perfect. Thankyou

[09:34:52] <Brodingo> muzone ive been using this http://raphaeljs.com/
[09:35:56] <muzone> Brodingo: thanks for the tip bro
[09:42:24] <Ogredude> alright, I'm having a bit of trouble getting this behavior set up.  http://jsfiddle.net/bjX8B/1/ <-- Desired behavior: When "New Computer" is selected, enable the new computer fields and show them, and hide the select.
[09:43:00] <Ogredude> I'm getting an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ( on line 2 of the js in there, not sure why.
[09:43:16] <Ogredude> oh wait
[09:43:20] <Ogredude> because I'm still stuck in Ruby
[09:44:10] <Ogredude> nope that wasn't it either
[09:44:19] <pifantastic> yeah, those parens are required
[09:45:28] <Ogredude> well, it's still not working. http://jsfiddle.net/bjX8B/2/
[09:46:06] <muzone> Ogredude: still stuck in ruby?
[09:46:18] <pifantastic> Ogredude: http://jsfiddle.net/b6atF/5/
[09:46:21] <muzone> Ogredude: other people have moved on from ruby??
[09:46:22] <muzone> to what?
[09:46:56] <Ogredude> muzone:  no, I mean that the Ruby syntax is so much different from JS that I get myself stuck a lot by using Ruby syntax in JS files
[09:47:05] <Ogredude> like optional parens, and forgetting semicolons
[09:47:18] <muzone> oh
[09:47:25] <aximilation> in otherwords, bad habits...? :D
[09:47:54] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here heavily experienced with templates?
[09:47:57] <ProLoser|Work> i'm having a bit of confusion
[09:48:18] <Ogredude> pifantastic:  okay final version, it works. http://jsfiddle.net/b6atF/6/
[09:48:36] <Ogredude> pifantastic:  what'd you do besides add parens and that console.log statement?
[09:48:39] <Bower^> does anyone know if the devs plan to add this debouncing functionality into jquery itself at some point?
[09:48:51] <Ogredude> aximilation:  depends on whether the majority of your work is Ruby or JS
[09:49:00] <pifantastic> Ogredude: .val() was returning "New Computer" and you had "new_computer"
[09:49:15] <pifantastic> you can take the console.log out, I didnt mean to leave that in
[09:49:31] <Ogredude> pifantastic:  that's because I typed val="whatever" instead of value="whatever"
[09:49:37] <aximilation> yea it's similar to going from php to a strongly typed language
[09:49:39] <ProLoser|Work> do i ever need to do ${$var} in templates?
[09:49:53] <Ogredude> so glad I don't work much with PHP anymore
[09:51:14] <Ogredude> alright, incidental question.  I see that you enable an element with $("selector").removeAttr("disabled") but how do you disable an element?
[09:51:34] <alex-> hey
[09:51:41] <Ogredude> I don't see an addAttr or anything similar in the docs
[09:52:29] <smftre> how can I convert a long of seconds to show days and hours and countdown every minute? I want to apply this to all items of classname on the current page

[09:55:29] <ngharo> ?prop @ Ogredude
[09:55:30] <bot-t> Ogredude, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[09:55:46] <pifantastic> it's made to show "X time ago", but I think you can configure it for fuiture times also
[09:56:09] <Ogredude> ngharo:  ah so you'd $("element").prop("disabled","disabled")
[09:56:44] <blackspotwiggins> the prop should actually be set to true not "disabled"
[09:56:46] <ngharo> Ogredude: read the docs :) it's .prop('disabled', true/false);
[09:57:10] <Ogredude> oh there it is, way down there
[09:57:12] <Ogredude> gotcha, thanks
[09:57:17] <ngharo> yep np
[10:00:51] <darkangel> Hi, is there any way to make a UI dialog "navigable", so you can load a page into it, and then load another, and then go back to the previous page?
[10:03:09] <ccmonsters> have an example of what you are looking for ?
[10:08:40] <alex-> Who can help me combining these 2 scripts: http://jsbin.com/ahaxe/edit#javascript,html         and           http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/         ?
[10:11:00] <ccmonsters> um, whats hard about combining it? and doyou really need to combine them, and why?
[10:14:16] <sphinxxx> how do i cache a variable of all the input of class "active",  assuming more will be appended later?
[10:14:28] <sphinxxx> so that it grabs the future ones as well
[10:14:52] <Brodingo> cant let you do that starfox
[10:15:00] <sphinxxx> lol
[10:15:09] <cakehero> LOL
[10:15:21] <Brodingo> ?livequery
[10:15:22] <bot-t> Brodingo, Plugins/livequery - Live Query utilizes the power of jQuery selectors by binding events or firing callbacks for matched elements auto-magically, even after the page has been loaded and the DOM updated. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[10:21:22] <darkangel> ccmonsters: Nope ... just wondering if there is an easy way to achieve such functionality.
[10:27:18] <alex-> pootpoot_: hey
[10:27:33] <pootpoot_> hi
[10:34:01] <muzone> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/DA5Ph/
[10:34:37] <muzone> do you know if theres a way to remove the borders?
[10:38:14] <RockMeAmadeus> How do I parse this jquery string in php "id[]=2&id[]=3&id[]=1&id[]=4&id[]=5" ?
[10:39:12] <jedimind> that seems like a question for ##php
[10:39:17] <nail_> parse_str()
[10:39:19] <watchedman> RockMeAmadeus: usually when you have a get parameter like that you can get it on the server side as an array called id
[10:39:35] <watchedman> so you'd access the values with $id[0] $id[1] etc
[10:39:58] <fris> $_GET['id']
[10:40:30] <watchedman> fris: that's what i meant thanks...so $_GET['id'][0] $_GET['id'][1] etc. should work right off the bat
[10:41:29] <mrgreenfur> I wrote a very simple plugin to show divs next to formelements. If I call it once, it works great, but the next calls all show exactly the same data.  Doesn't seem like it's really executing again. Anyone know whats going on?
[10:42:26] <nail_> show some code
[10:47:53] <mrgreenfur> here's the plugin file: http://pastie.org/2558776
[10:48:10] <mrgreenfur> I think I'm lost as to what exactly gets put into $(this)
[10:48:55] <mrgreenfur> I assumed if I call $(''ABC").simplesttip() then $(this) in the plugin is equal to$("ABC")
[10:55:39] <sparuvu> jQuery change event on text box is not firing
[10:55:46] <sparuvu> what could be the reason
[10:56:15] <sparuvu> here is what I am trying$(".keyword").live("change", function(e) {
[10:56:15] <sparuvu> 			jv.Connections.search();
[10:56:15] <sparuvu> 	});
[10:58:18] <MoTiOnXml> SICK javascript @ http://www.dhteumeuleu.com/
[10:58:22] <MoTiOnXml> check the demos
[10:58:28] <MoTiOnXml> it's insane
[10:59:57] <k2s> hi! wanted to ask how todetect when an animated object is under the cursor? mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseleave and mousemove events doesnt detect that.
[11:01:57] <sparuvu> jQuery change event on text box is not firing
[11:02:06] <nail_> mrgreenfur: it's because of your $.extends
[11:02:26] <nail_> that actually modifies the target object
[11:02:44] <nail_> so change that to $.extend({}, defaults, options)
[11:03:20] <nail_> it's not a 'this' problem, your 'this'es are correctly bound to the right element
[11:05:09] <k2s> can anyone help me with the question i posted would grately apreciate it :)
[11:06:16] <Brodingo> k2s thats kind of an assbackward way of detecting "interaction"
[11:06:18] <mrgreenfur> nail_:  Ah! That fixed it! Thank you. Now I gotta figure out why the defaults don't work
[11:06:31] <Brodingo> if you want to check if an element is animated you can use .is(':animated')
[11:07:33] <k2s> Brodingo: i need this for a game im develop[ing
[11:08:13] <Brodingo> well im sure there is some way to log mouse position and check the position and dimensions of an element to determine if they overlap
[11:08:33] <Brodingo> but that seems kind of complicated doesnt it
[11:08:46] <k2s> Brodingo: yap and resurse demanding
[11:09:01] <k2s> Brodingo: yap and resurse demandin
[11:09:29] <k2s> Brodingo: sory for that :) i thought maybe there is a simpler way to detect it
[11:10:06] <Brodingo> maybe there is, im no expert
[11:10:33] <k2s> :) ok ty anyway for notising
[11:10:34] <muzone> Brodingo: damn, raphaeljs IS the shit!!
[11:10:40] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[11:10:59] <Brodingo> can play pretty well with jquery too
[11:11:08] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[11:11:16] <ProLoser|Work> i'm doing a cross-site request and am a little confused about jsonp
[11:11:36] <muzone> sweet
[11:12:51] <Brodingo> made map using $.getJSON to load paths and $.each to iterate and build them with raphael
[11:12:56] <ProLoser|Work> do i just do .ajax({jsonp: true}): ?
[11:13:05] <jds> Heya
[11:13:18] <ProLoser|Work> Brodingo: what's raphael? js templating?
[11:13:29] <Brodingo> sorry ProLoser|Work  that was to muzone
[11:13:56] <jds> Is anyone using sproutcore 2 with jquery 1.6?  I'm having some IE problems...
[11:14:01] <jds> jQuery.extend(true, {}, {foo:[]})  runs out of stack space
[11:14:09] <jds> Still trying to narrow it down...
[11:14:37] <pifantastic> jds: How exactly does sproutcore come into play?
[11:14:52] <jds> pifantastic:  AFAICT, it's pimping out Array.prototype
[11:14:54] <jds> but I'm not sure yet
[11:15:43] <ProLoser|Work> Brodingo: i know, was just curious
[11:15:55] <Brodingo> oh, well its an svg library
[11:16:06] <ProLoser|Work> is the jsonp callback almost identical to a success callback?
[11:16:24] <ProLoser|Work> Brodingo: ah i see
[11:16:29] <mrgreenfur> nail_: This is great, working now. Thanks for your help!
[11:17:32] <nail_> mrgreenfur: no worries :)
[11:18:17] <pifantastic> jds: looks like you're right https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore/blob/master/frameworks/runtime/ext/array.js

[11:25:38] <Brodingo> how nice that  her demo is exactly the same as the raphael js demo
[11:25:58] <muzone> well its a bit different

[11:26:49] <Vik> anyone interested/bored enough to have a look at my just-launched site?
[11:27:03] <Vik> feedback, comments will be much appreciated!!
[11:27:20] <Vik> link: http://judg.me
[11:28:01] <di0de> i haz feedback
[11:28:08] <Brodingo> muzone for my map i had an illustrator file, saved as an svg, then used http://readysetraphael.com/
[11:28:18] <fris> vik very unique way of rating
[11:28:19] <di0de> main text box cuts off
[11:28:23] <di0de> can't scroll
[11:28:31] <di0de> first impression sux
[11:28:34] <blackspotwiggins> Vik, i dont see the image im supposed to rate
[11:28:38] <muzone> wow
[11:28:42] <muzone> right on bro!!!
[11:28:54] <di0de> your shits all wack in different browsers
[11:28:55] <di0de> fix plz
[11:29:11] <Vik> shit, i checked on browsershots, and it looked alright
[11:29:35] <di0de> great concept though
[11:29:38] <Vik> blackspotwiggins: refresh? site is dealing with some rather heavy traffic
[11:29:40] <olinux> var theTable = $('.myTable');  if (theTable != undefined) { theTable.tablesorter(); }
[11:29:51] <di0de> i have firefox 6 and ie 7 for testing and something's broken in each
[11:30:06] <di0de> didn't bother pulling out ie6/8/9 and chrome and safari and etc
[11:30:12] <di0de> but as a concept it's awesome
[11:30:15] <muzone> that made my day Brodingo
[11:30:17] <muzone> thanks man..
[11:30:17] <Vik> di0de: thanks. execution might not be perfect (not a designer), but i will be iterating/tweaking constantly
[11:30:18] <di0de> and click/results functionality is awesome
[11:30:22] <Brodingo> yay! no prob
[11:30:27] <Vik> excellent, that's reassuring to know
[11:30:43] <di0de> your ads won't show to a LOT of users
[11:30:49] <di0de> need to fix up the code/layout
[11:30:52] <di0de> besides that cool
[11:30:55] <olinux> theTable.tablesorter(); should never be called unless myTable exists - but i get Error: theTable.tablesorter is not a function
[11:31:09] <Vik> sweet
[11:31:18] <di0de> psd2html.com really does excellent slicing work, a bit expensive (i use it for my clients' sites) but really excellent work
[11:31:46] <di0de> now i need a php/ajax programmer
[11:32:05] <Vik> great,will check it out. I used a lot of whitespace here, because (1) i'm not great at design, and (2) in my mind, minimal = elegant
[11:32:17] <Vik> not sure if judg.me comes across as elegant though :p
[11:32:21] <di0de> not about the design
[11:32:31] <di0de> just about the cross-browser compatibility and adhering to certain standards
[11:32:36] <di0de> the 960 grid system is a great one
[11:32:39] <di0de> www.960.gs
[11:32:46] <di0de> they have templates you can use
[11:32:49] <di0de> it's the current web standard
[11:33:01] <Vik> gah. why did i just find out about this site!
[11:33:16] <Vik> thanks, looks like i've some work cut out for myself
[11:33:22] <di0de> lol
[11:33:29] <di0de> well at least the tough stuff is done
[11:33:32] <di0de> html/css is easy :P
[11:33:40] <di0de> design/slice/pop in what you have already
[11:33:54] <di0de> want to trade some services? how are you with php/mysql/ajax
[11:35:00] <Vik> hah. well, C++ developer here, actually. this was just a side project to keep my php fresh
[11:36:30] <BreezeKeeper> hi .. is it possible to add a widget after jquery is loaded ? because i want to use the datepicker and cant modify the jquery version which ist loaded .. so can i load it after jquery ?
[11:36:43] <di0de> ah no worries
[11:36:57] <di0de> i have html, i need this to "work": http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16056862/Divvali%20Australia%20-%20Client%20Order%20Form%20-%20Sample%20r1.0%20-%20Jun-01-2011.jpg
[11:37:46] <blackspotwiggins> out of curiosity, why php and mysql?
[11:42:34] <imsky> why not
[11:42:34] <bot-t> (17 hours 10 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky DOOONT STOP BELIIEEEVIIIN in jquery
[11:42:38] <imsky> ahahaha
[11:43:43] <vviljanen> php/mysql are free, and cheap to host. I guess that's one reason to use them.
[11:44:38] <muzone> Brodingo: add me man http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001244569636
[11:44:52] <muzone> Cork[home]: you too
[11:45:42] <Brodingo> muzone do you have twitter
[11:50:27] <muzone> Brodingo: nah man
[11:53:02] <JonathanCutrell_> Room seems a little quiet.
[11:53:18] <JonathanCutrell_> seems like there should be a bot response to that...
[11:54:59] <enjoycrf> wow
[11:55:10] <enjoycrf> this the only room i didnt get banned from
[11:55:11] <enjoycrf> lol
[11:56:08] <enjoycrf> isnt that awesome
[11:57:16] <aghouseh> is it possible to send a function name as an option to a jquery plugin?
[11:57:45] <aghouseh> im trying to extend jq hoverscroll to have a function trigger whenever it scrolls
[12:01:40] <JonathanCutrell_> aghouseh: you'll probably want to just trigger an event inside the plugin on the element the plugin targets.
[12:02:28] <aghouseh> yeah, i didnt want to completely muck up the original code. was trying to just extend it ever so slightly, though :)
[12:02:43] <aghouseh> plus im not sure of the best method to do all of this, as i am relatively green
[12:02:56] <JonathanCutrell_> aghouseh: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:03:24] <JonathanCutrell_> aghouseh: so basically what you'll want to do is find out whatever the element is that the plugin is targeting (usually it will be cached at the top of the plugin outside of any closures)
[12:03:43] <aghouseh> nod, $this
[12:04:09] <JonathanCutrell_> aghouseh: then once the scroll actually executes (you'll have to look through the source to figure that one out), you'll just do $this.trigger("customEventName")
[12:04:31] <JonathanCutrell_> aghouseh: then outside of the plugin, you can bind to that event directly on the element
[12:04:35] <aghouseh> ah ok cool
[12:05:02] <JonathanCutrell_> so, $("#element").bind("customEventName", function(){ // do whatever it is you want to do})
[12:05:14] <JonathanCutrell_> are you sure that the plugin you're using doesn't have a built in callback?
[12:05:18] <aghouseh> yeah, it doesnt
[12:05:19] <aghouseh> i checked
[12:05:22] <JonathanCutrell_> ok
[12:05:29] <aghouseh> woulda made things easy on me  :)
[12:05:37] <JonathanCutrell_> you could always build that and submit to github.
[12:05:38] <JonathanCutrell_> :)
[12:05:40] <aghouseh> thanks a ton for help.. thats exactly what i needed :)
[12:05:47] <JonathanCutrell_> anytime
[12:05:49] <JonathanCutrell_> well..
[12:05:51] <JonathanCutrell_> not any time.
[12:06:03] <aghouseh> yeah, not confident enough in my skills to be able to get there yet, but someday
[12:06:15] <aghouseh> yeah pretty much going to call you at 3am now
[12:06:39] <JonathanCutrell_> I think it should be a pretty universal option that plugins have event firing to bind to.
[12:06:55] <JonathanCutrell_> maybe not universal, but definitely event-based plugins like scrolling or animation.
[12:07:04] <aghouseh> yeah, i figured it would also, since it seems to be a pretty popular/developed plugin
[12:07:07] <aghouseh> yeah
[12:08:04] <JonathanCutrell_> Be sure you look for all of the different spots the event might actually occur btw. Sometimes there are fringe conditional executions that you can easily leave out, and then the event doesn't fire on the fringe cases.
[12:08:05] <aghouseh> the vegas fullscreen image plugin i used for a project was extremely well developed so easy to implement whatever i was trying to do.
[12:08:23] <aghouseh> gotcha, trying to pinpoint it right now.
[12:08:56] <aple> Does anyone know what slider plugin resizes the box and pushes content down as it transitions?
[12:09:02] <aple> I can't get Cycle to do it
[12:17:56] <astropirate> jQuery is too hard!
[12:18:07] <blackspotwiggins> try gardening
[12:18:32] <astropirate> dude i have like the awesome-est garden ever
[12:18:37] <astropirate> i got lots of stuff growing
[12:19:10] <blindMoe> astropirate: you live in California?  Growing some 'medicine'? ;)
[12:19:31] <astropirate> haha no VA growing fruits in my backyard
[12:19:42] <blackspotwiggins> oh, nice :D
[12:21:24] <cakehero> Whats a great templating language for me to use with my JS stuff?
[12:21:39] <blackspotwiggins> moustachio
[12:21:41] <blackspotwiggins> !
[12:21:52] <cakehero> k
[12:22:09] <blackspotwiggins> cakehero, https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/
[12:22:24] <cakehero> blackspotwiggins:  im there
[12:22:50] <cakehero> blackspotwiggins: thank you
[12:24:12] <aple> Anyone know of a slideshow that will expand/contract depending on the size of the slide?
[12:29:29] <cakehero> aple: maybe you can do that in CSS
[12:31:06] <cakehero> blackspotwiggins: Sweet, do you use this with backboner.js by any chance?
[12:32:30] <blackspotwiggins> haha backboner :D
[12:32:42] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, but not directly
[12:33:07] <astropirate> i did't like it. not at all.
[12:33:29] <aple> cakehero: I've tried, but don't think it's possible.
[12:34:29] <cakehero> blackspotwiggins: yeah, backboner
[12:34:36] <cakehero> blackspotwiggins: there is no other name for it
[12:34:47] <cakehero> blackspotwiggins: my directory for it is js/bbr
[12:34:51] <cakehero> bbr = backboner
[12:34:52] <cakehero> heh
[12:35:19] <blackspotwiggins> it's neat if you get used to the practices, but i'm still a bit weirded out by it
[12:35:39] <mikeric_> how can you set a contenteditable element to be in edit/focus state?
[12:35:41] <kh4n> hi guys, I'm trying to determine which element fired the submit event on form and I'm kinda having difficulty doing this, since the event listener is attached to "submit" on form, is there any simple way to get this without attaching multiple listeners on multiple elements?
[12:36:21] <blackspotwiggins> kh4n, i dont think you can get that from the event, document.activeElement might help
[12:37:23] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: that looks good, let me try that
[12:38:33] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: hmm, taht works pretty well if I fire by enter inside the input, but it returns the whole body while clicking on the submit button
[12:38:46] <blackspotwiggins> yep, not very reliable
[12:38:55] <kh4n> pitty, it was a good call
[12:39:02] <kh4n> well then i guess, i'm going to have to use 2 listeners
[12:39:32] <kh4n> see the point is having a searchform within the google maps inside of a bigger form
[12:40:28] <kh4n> and from search input, I just want to send the value to the gmaps api, for other inputs, I want to submit form
[12:40:41] <kh4n> I know, it's kinda messy, but it's the best call so far I've been able to think about
[12:40:46] <kh4n> in terms of UX
[12:42:22] <kayam> hmm
[12:43:49] <akiva> Is anyone else having issues using getJSON with twitter all of a sudden?
[12:43:57] <akiva> The URL works fine in my browser
[12:44:06] <akiva> But now I get "parseerror" returned
[12:44:19] <kh4n> two event listeners, one for input, one for submit are ugly, i can't help myself
[12:45:17] <jjulian> hi
[12:45:34] <cakehero> hi
[12:46:15] <jjulian> is this in any way possible: <div id="test"><script> console.log($(this).attr('id'));</script></div>  to get the id ?
[12:46:20] <kh4n> akiva: mine works ok so far
[12:46:27] <jjulian> so to get the parent element around the executed script?
[12:46:29] <akiva> Hm. :?
[12:46:30] <akiva> Thanks
[12:46:34] <enjoycrf> hey guys
[12:46:54] <enjoycrf> is it possible that when u execute js code line after line
[12:47:06] <kh4n> jjulian: why would you want it that way?
[12:47:10] <kayam> parent()
[12:47:13] <enjoycrf> that the next line got executed before the last line?
[12:47:26] <jjulian> i have some code snippets which i need to convert from document.write to this
[12:47:30] <enjoycrf> where none of the line have ajax
[12:47:32] <kayam> jjulian, $(this).parent().id
[12:47:48] <blackspotwiggins> kh4n, you could take the gmaps one out of the form?
[12:48:01] <jjulian> kayam: that doesn't seem to work $(this) is filled with DOM root
[12:48:05] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: well, i could, but wouldn't look that nice
[12:48:09] <kh4n> but it*
[12:48:17] <jjulian> kayam: so DOMWindow i.e. in safari
[12:48:21] <blackspotwiggins> well, that's a css issue
[12:48:51] <blackspotwiggins> other than that, yeah 2nd handler that stops the submit
[12:49:12] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: agreed, however I don't think that fighting with absolute positions inside the form is worth of that
[12:49:21] <blackspotwiggins> yeah true..
[12:49:40] <blackspotwiggins> there are some attributes for that, but im not sure if/how they work crossbrowser
[12:50:10] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: that's what I'm kinda afraid of, so from the point of safety, 2 event handlers will do just good
[12:50:30] <dismist> anyone know how, using tabs jquery ui, i can make a tab change the url of the page? (so that when i visit index.html#tabname it opens the proper tab?
[12:50:42] <kh4n> activeElement property is supernice idea, however it's html5 dev version, so it's kinda unusable for public use
[12:51:09] <blackspotwiggins> it's been supported forever
[12:51:14] <kh4n> really?
[12:51:16] <blackspotwiggins> they just added it to spec now
[12:51:28] <Elephant> dismist: This probably isn't the best way, but the way I've accomplished that is to just check the "location.hash" onLoad
[12:51:33] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: ah, you're just the type of hacker I need :)
[12:51:45] <Elephant> and trigger the event
[12:51:56] <Elephant> that you wish to trigger
[12:53:04] <blackspotwiggins> kh4n, i've solved this in the submit handler
[12:53:13] <blackspotwiggins> i checked if the field has a value
[12:53:18] <blackspotwiggins> if it doesn't, all good
[12:53:28] <blackspotwiggins> if it does, preventDefault
[12:54:00] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: that's actually very clever
[12:54:25] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: on the other hand, that will inevitably deny submiting the form via other inputs, wouldn't it?
[12:54:36] <cakehero> blackspotwiggins: what about http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/ ?
[12:55:03] <blackspotwiggins> kh4n, it depends on the exact behaviour you want, if the field is normally empty, it should work ok
[12:55:11] <blackspotwiggins> if you need it to retain a value you have an issue
[12:55:51] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: well the full issue is filling a form for an event, that's name, text and some description info + snapping the location to google maps
[12:56:21] <blackspotwiggins> you could have a hidden form for the regular submit
[12:56:26] <blackspotwiggins> hidden field even
[12:56:38] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: but in fact, the map is located on the bottom of the form, so the only next field you can encounter is real form submit
[12:57:09] <kh4n> blackspotwiggins: I think, you don't really have to, you can check for some other ID of a input
[12:57:43] <kh4n> nah, foolish me
[13:07:36] <aple> Anyone know of a jQuery slider plugin that will expand/contract it's container so content under it will readjust accordingly?
[13:07:50] <aple> I've tried Cycle and Nivo and looked at a bunch of others.
[13:08:35] <xwintermute> apple, try https://github.com/joelambert/Flux-Slider ?
[13:08:41] <xwintermute> err aple
[13:15:19] <aple> I haven't tried it, but I did add an image to it that was a weird size and cycled through them and it didn't adjust the containing div so nothing changed.
[13:17:08] <juiceman5000> var bar = "table."+__tRecord+" input.rowVar"; var foo = $(bar).val();
[13:17:12] <juiceman5000> this does not work
[13:17:17] <juiceman5000> why or how?
[13:17:37] <juiceman5000> __tRecord being whatever value could be placed in a string.
[13:18:01] <juiceman5000> basically I want to use jq to get a dynamically generated classname
[13:18:09] <juiceman5000> but cannot use variables in calling to it
[13:20:30] <juiceman5000> please ignore me. it's a RTFM day
[13:34:59] <kanja2> Are there situations where e.stopImmediatePropagation would allow events to keep propagating?
[13:35:31] <cheezus> i swear to god every computer ever made hates me
[13:50:51] <fission6> how would i find all youtube vide links? i want to use a lightbox player but need to dynamically find all youtube videos and add a propery to the link
[13:55:08] <razzi> fission something like $("a[href*='youtube.com']") maybe
[13:59:35] <maximedt> hello
[13:59:57] <maximedt> I have a problem in jquery
[14:00:28] <kanja2> Is there a way to use live such that a newly bound event is moved to the front of that elements event queue?
[14:01:29] <kanja2>  I know I can shuffle order of the elements data('events') array to alter the event order, but is there some way I can do that automatically on live's auto binding?
[14:02:35] <marzen> hi all, i've got some jquery/js related work and was wondering if anyone knew of a good job board to post to?
[14:04:58] <badabim> Hi, I have a question about Deferred objects.
[14:05:23] <badabim> I have a method which may or may not need to perform an ajax call.
[14:06:01] <badabim> I would like to return the xhr (which is a deferred), and in the case that the ajax call is unnecessary, return another deferred.
[14:06:15] <badabim> the question: does deferred.resolve() also return a deferred?
[14:06:47] <badabim> so I could do this:  return jQuery.Deferred().resolve()
[14:07:08] <sparta> is it possible to read a text file from hard disk using jquery?
[14:07:27] <fission6> how would i do a regex check against a list of hrefs?
[14:08:49] <ravenzz> ?demo @ fission6
[14:08:49] <bot-t> fission6, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:09:09] <astropirate> sparta, no. Imagine the shit storm that would cause
[14:09:31] <nohorse> I'm trying to fire an event after a JQM listview is refreshed.  is there a list of bindable events for the JQM controls?
[14:09:57] <fission6> ravenzz, i just want to find all links with youtube matching this regex, http://snipplr.com/view/33375/
[14:10:50] <sparta> hmm
[14:11:23] <kanja2> is there a seletor function that works like the descendant selector? I have an object and I want to select every node below it that matches a selector
[14:11:50] <marzen> hi all, i've got some jquery/js related work and was wondering if anyone knew of a good job board to post to that's just jquery/js related?
[14:12:16] <fission6> $("a[href]").filter(function() {
[14:12:17] <fission6>         return this.value.match(/http:\/\/(?:youtu\.be\/|(?:[a-z]{2,3}\.)?youtube\.com\/watch(?:\?|#\!)v=)([\w-]{11}).*/gi);
[14:12:17] <fission6>     }).attr("rel","prettyPhoto");
[14:12:20] <fission6> thats what i have
[14:12:26] <fission6> sorry should have pastebined it
[14:12:41] <watchedman> marzen: there's one called authenticjobs.com that is pretty close to what you're seeking...not just jQuery/JS but focused on that
[14:12:47] <Davey> OK, so I'm looking for something I can use as a drop-in replacement for <input type="file"> that will give me a progress bar - I don't need multiple file upload (in fact, we MUST NOT allow it), any suggestions?
[14:13:21] <marzen> watchedman: thanks, i'll check it out
[14:16:54] <ravenzz> fission6 http://jsfiddle.net/Yvz3Y/
[14:19:44] <fission6> ok i think whati had worked, hmm just doesn't seem to fire the ightbox
[14:20:25] <ravenzz> fission6 http://jsfiddle.net/Yvz3Y/1/ with your regex
[14:21:02] <Gorkyman> what do you guys think of jaxscript ?
[14:21:51] <fission6> ah thanks ravenzz

[14:33:34] <Veejay> Hi everyone. Is it possible to get an array containing the data-foo attributes of all checked checkboxes on a page?
[14:33:47] <Veejay> I tried fiddling with each and map to no success
[14:35:26] <maximedt> someone can help me with a bug
[14:35:39] <maximedt> i don't how to debug, i don't know if it's js conflict
[14:36:04] <maximedt> or something else but a two lines basic function doesn't work
[14:40:46] <maximedt> $('form').submit(function() { alert('submit'); });
[14:40:53] <maximedt> is there anybody?
[14:43:35] <Davey> Veejay: var dataFoos = []; $('input[type=checkbox]').each(function() { dataFoos.push($(this).data('foo'); }); should work
[14:45:06] <watchedman> maximedt: I think you need to write up the function so that it first shows the alert box, then submits the form
[14:46:13] <watchedman> something like $('form').click(function() { alert('submit'); $(this).submit(); });
[14:46:25] <watchedman> I'm not an expert tho so someone else please correct me if I'm wrong
[14:46:45] <watchedman> actually not $('form') but the identifier for your submit button
[14:46:46] <Veejay> Davey: Thanks
[14:47:31] <watchedman> i think I'm missing something but that may give you good google keywords to get the real solution
[14:49:20] <watchedman> maximedt: I think this is the missing link http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/ first you prevent the default from happening, then you do your alert or whatever, then you trigger the original event with jQuery
[14:58:04] <maximedt> watchedman
[14:58:18] <watchedman> yes I am here for 2 more minutes
[14:58:31] <maximedt> it works on another
[14:58:40] <maximedt> i think there is a conflict with two js files
[15:00:05] <watchedman> okay maximedt you may be able to eventually use your original approach, but the preventDefault is still a good technique to check out because then you could for example perform operations on the form input values before submitting them if you wanted
[15:01:20] <fission6> how would i do a "does not contain" compairson
[15:01:46] <sean`> ?not @ fission6
[15:01:46] <bot-t> fission6, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[15:03:47] <fission6> or better yet does not have a rel of 'prettyPhoto'
[15:03:50] <fission6> attribute
[15:06:07] <fission6> $("a.not(rel^='prettyPhoto')")
[15:12:57] <fission6> i would think this is it no? $("a.not([rel^='prettyPhoto'])")
[15:22:58] <sean`> fission6, $('a:not([rel^="prettyPhoto"])')
[15:23:22] <sean`> fission6, or $('a').not('[rel^="prettyPhoto"]')
[15:26:08] <Soothsayer_> test
[15:26:09] <fission6> $("a[rel != 'prettyPhoto']") that seemed to work
[15:26:24] <Soothsayer_> Can anyone recommend a jQuery slider/gallery plugin that supports cross fades like this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3UlCObK0rM
[15:28:32] <boopluup> hey there. i'm developing a plugin that keeps track of all plugin-enabled elements on the page. what's the conventional way to interact with a plugin without passing in a selector? add a separate function to $.myPluginName?
[15:28:53] <WeeJeWel> I am searching for a plugin that will add a bar to a menu that will smoothly follow the mouse. suggestions?
[15:28:56] <uchuff> Soothsayer_: i've not looked at your video but just wanted to suggest Galleria as one to look at
[15:29:28] <uchuff> WeeJeWel: you mean as you hover round a page there's a bar following your cursor?
[15:29:49] <WeeJeWel> uchuff only on the menu. Seems it's called lavalamp, just found it
[15:29:57] <uchuff> ah
[15:30:12] <uchuff> yeah
[15:30:12] <uchuff> lavalamp
[15:30:20] <uchuff> didn't get that from your explanation, but now I've read it I see what you mean!
[15:30:27] <uchuff> *re-read
[15:31:28] <WeeJeWel> :)
[15:31:54] <Soothsayer_> uchuff, right. I'm not sure if galleria has a true cross fade.. the transition is too fast on their website demo.
[15:32:27] <testa_> sadsadfasdf
[15:32:29] <testa_> asdfasdfasdf
[15:32:30] <testa_> asdfasdf
[15:32:31] <testa_> asdfasd
[15:32:32] <testa_> sdf
[15:32:33] <testa_> asdf
[15:32:35] <uchuff> testa_: u moms
[15:33:07] <testa_> mphhh
[15:33:23] <testa_> a con que esto se puede hacer con jquery..
[15:33:27] <testa_> mphhhh
[15:34:29] <Soothsayer_> uchuff, besides, I don't want a gallery with thumbnails, etc.. just a slideshow
[15:36:53] <uchuff> no worries
[15:37:10] <uchuff> just figured i'd mention it as it seems pretty popular
[15:48:30] <boopluup> hey there. i'm developing a plugin that keeps track of all plugin-enabled elements on the page. what's the conventional way to interact with a plugin without passing in a selector? add a separate function to $.myPluginName?
[15:55:17] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[15:55:26] <ProLoser|Work> i'm having trouble using jsonp
[15:55:31] <ProLoser|Work> this jsonpCallback, do i need it?
[15:55:36] <ProLoser|Work> or can i just use success normally?
[16:00:28] <amid_hasan> hi. how do i push a value generated using javascript into a div using jquery. i tried append, but something isnt working
[16:02:22] <ngharo> ?p @ amid_hasan
[16:02:23] <bot-t> amid_hasan, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:03:10] <ngharo> ProLoser|Work: you can use success unless your script returns a hardcoded function name
[16:03:18] <ngharo> script as in server side
[16:05:22] <s34n> .dialog({autoOpen: false})  is leaving my div visible on my page. It also doesn't respond to subsequent .dialog('open') or .dialog('close') commands.
[16:06:19] <ProLoser|Work> ngharo: so i don't need to do anything special for jsonp?
[16:06:27] <ProLoser|Work> like setting jsonp true or false or setting a cllback method?
[16:07:31] <ngharo> "If the URL includes the string "callback=?" (or similar, as defined by the server-side API), the request is treated as JSONP instead."
[16:08:31] <ProLoser|Work> so i should just add that to the url?
[16:08:35] <enjoycrf> yoyoyo
[16:08:40] <s34n> .dialog() makes it open but seemingly without any css prettinesss
[16:08:41] <ProLoser|Work> is ? an example or the actual value?
[16:09:53] <ngharo> actual value.  jquery will automagically replace '?' with a generated callback name
[16:11:53] <CannedCorn> the autocomplete people use is now part of jqueryui right?
[16:13:56] <SEJeff_work> CannedCorn, Yes
[16:14:03] <CannedCorn> ok
[16:17:34] <boopluup> how can i store an object that applies to the whole page instead of a single element in a plugin?
[16:17:45] <boopluup> a Three.js world for example
[16:18:29] <CannedCorn> hey guys, anyone here
[16:18:38] <CannedCorn> gurus that is
[16:26:46] <Meetoman> hey guys
[16:26:51] <Meetoman> how do i make cross domain webservice calls?
[16:27:35] <ProLoser|Work> with ajax?
[16:27:37] <ProLoser|Work> use jsonp
[16:29:14] <boopluup> where should i store data associated with the whole page instead of a single element? $.data(document.body, ...) is that safe?
[16:29:21] <CannedCorn> i'm getting cross domain problems trying to make json calls from local files
[16:29:32] <CannedCorn> jsonp isn't an option, what can i do?
[16:29:43] <ProLoser|Work> ngharo: so might i have some.url/?callback=?
[16:29:58] <Meetoman> ProLoser|Work jsonp only work with GET
[16:29:59] <ProLoser|Work> boopluup: yes
[16:30:05] <Meetoman> i am trying to do it from localhost for development
[16:30:06] <ProLoser|Work> CannedCorn: hashed iframe or something?
[16:30:43] <CannedCorn> nah just a simple page with an input box that I'm trying to get autocomplete working for
[16:30:52] <CannedCorn> the autocomplete data comes from foursquare
[16:30:58] <boopluup> thanks
[16:33:46] <Meetoman> ProLoser|Work?
[16:33:57] <ProLoser|Work> what?
[16:57:02] <name54234> Hi, I was wondering if there were any plugins for creating 3d graphs? I have several nodes, each connected via a line, and I would like them to be connected in a 3d rather than 2d space, if you dont know of any good 3d plugins, do you know of a good 2d one? preferablly with drag and drop capabilities
[17:08:13] <xsamurai> Im trying to escape the ? character yet I keep getting invalid quantifier,    if (current_url.search('\?') > 0)
[17:09:14] <enjoycrf> u dont need to escape it
[17:09:25] <enjoycrf> ur not in regex mode
[17:09:45] <enjoycrf> (current_url.search('?') > 0)
[17:09:52] <pputman> orly?
[17:10:02] <enjoycrf> :O
[17:10:02] <xsamurai> odd i get the same error without /
[17:10:05] <xsamurai> err  \
[17:10:19] <enjoycrf> try "?"
[17:10:35] <xsamurai> did that as well
[17:10:50] <enjoycrf> ok try regex mode then
[17:10:58] <enjoycrf> (current_url.search(/\?'/) > 0)
[17:11:03] <enjoycrf> (current_url.search(/\?/) > 0)
[17:11:43] <enjoycrf> besides its
[17:11:53] <enjoycrf> (current_url.search(/\?/) > -1)
[17:12:12] <enjoycrf> actually
[17:12:17] <enjoycrf> (current_url.search(/\?/) != -1)
[17:12:29] <xsamurai> > 0 would imply the same
[17:12:30] <xsamurai> =)
[17:12:31] <hsbot>   Not in scope: `would'Not in scope: `imply'Not in scope: `the'Not in scope: `same'
[17:12:41] <enjoycrf> not realy
[17:13:23] <enjoycrf> this is how i do it
[17:13:23] <enjoycrf> if (v.search(/_all/i) > -1 || Grid.CountChecks() >= 25) {
[17:14:20] <xsamurai> enjoycrf: thanks for the help
[17:14:30] <enjoycrf> did it work
[17:14:39] <xsamurai> yep regex mode worked
[17:14:59] <enjoycrf> eeeeeexactly
[17:15:05] <enjoycrf> gime money
[17:15:21] * xsamurai hands enjoycrf an irc dollar
[17:15:28] <xsamurai> dont spend it all in one place
[17:16:15] <enjoycrf> ass
[17:16:18] <enjoycrf> lol
[17:18:29] <mape> Is there any way to cancel an animation inside the step callback? Even if I run .stop() on the animating element it still runs the animate past when I shut it down
[17:30:36] <Dave_Stein> mape stop should do the trick if it's used correctly
[17:31:06] <mape> Dave_Stein: Yeah, but if I do $el.stop() the first thing I do in step I still move a tiny bit
[17:33:06] <Dave_Stein> mape why do you need to stop the animation the instance it starts?
[17:33:07] <mape> Dave_Stein: I don't I just need to stop it if a prop value exceeds a value
[17:33:10] <mape> but now it seems to be disregarding the .stop() hence why I tried to run stop all the time to see if it still disregarded it
[17:33:34] <mape> does the clearQueue in stop make any difference?
[17:33:54] <Dave_Stein> well if you start an animation i believe it runs and then calls step
[17:33:58] <Dave_Stein> but i'm not 100% sure
[17:34:05] <mape> so there is no pre step?`
[17:35:12] <Dave_Stein> i dont see anything about before
[17:35:13] <Dave_Stein> "the step function called after each animation step"
[17:35:17] <Dave_Stein> http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1856-Using-jQuery-s-Animate-Step-Callback-Function-To-Create-Custom-Animations.htm
[17:35:27] <mape> yeah..
[17:35:53] <Dave_Stein> if it can't exceed a certain value, when you do stop, why dont you also set the value manually to the max
[17:35:57] <Dave_Stein> since you know youre only stopping if it hits max
[17:36:52] <Dave_Stein> i doubt it would be noticable
[17:39:39] <iamamoron> hi there
[17:39:54] <iamamoron> any ideas where can i find ui-icon lists?
[17:40:10] <iamamoron> ui-icon-search gives a search icon
[17:40:14] <iamamoron> i want to know all the names
[17:46:03] <CannedCorn> hey guys, is there a tool that will download all files needed for a website, like the css and images
[17:46:12] <CannedCorn> i have a mockup someone did for me with a million tiny images
[17:46:22] <CannedCorn> and i want to just get them in a folder/zip
[17:46:42] <CannedCorn> if you know of anything like that it would help me out a ton
[17:48:10] <ajpiano> CannedCorn: there are tools that will smoosh all those images into one file and write the css to use sprites
[17:48:19] <ajpiano> which will have way lower request overhead as well
[17:48:20] <ajpiano> http://spriteme.org/
[17:54:35] <CannedCorn> ah
[17:54:40] <CannedCorn> thanks ajpiano

[18:09:51] <imsky> i guess it depends on how you view it
[18:09:57] <imsky> do you view it as a skill that can be acquired
[18:10:00] <imsky> or as an innate ability
[18:10:07] <abjorn> both
[18:10:17] <imsky> well
[18:10:21] <abjorn> I have no talent for it, but I struggle to get good at it
[18:10:32] <abjorn> http://coreymedia.com/projects/vidyadev-design/
[18:10:38] <imsky> i think it's a better bet to figure out your priorities bro
[18:10:49] <imsky> i love mathematics too, but i'm not going to get the fields medal ever, ever
[18:10:58] <abjorn> I'm the kind of guy who tries to be good at everything lol
[18:11:04] <imsky> well that's a cliche
[18:11:08] <imsky> that's not a bad design though
[18:11:10] <abjorn> Not the best
[18:11:12] <imsky> pretty standard for communities
[18:11:13] <abjorn> but good
[18:11:46] <abjorn> idk, my best thing will always be the jaboscripts
[18:11:46] <imsky> in many cases aesthetics don't really matter
[18:11:54] <imsky> yeeee boiiii
[18:11:59] <abjorn> I can jaboscripts all over
[18:12:07] <imsky> jaboscript mafia
[18:12:15] <abjorn> yea son
[18:12:28] <abjorn> I'm a straight up oj
[18:12:35] <abjorn> original jaboscripter
[18:12:35] <imsky> haven't you been working on this design for a while now
[18:12:42] <abjorn> yeah i had one going for awhile
[18:12:45] <abjorn> that i got tired of
[18:12:50] <abjorn> so i started fresh
[18:13:03] <imsky> these days i'm going mobile-first baby
[18:13:09] <imsky> hence my new spartan redesign
[18:13:11] <abjorn> except I kept the logo and fonts
[18:13:18] <abjorn> meh
[18:13:19] <imsky> i recommend this approach as well
[18:13:22] <abjorn> I never care much about mobile...
[18:13:26] <imsky> you should brah
[18:13:28] <abjorn> I should
[18:13:30] <abjorn> but I never do
[18:13:31] <imsky> all the designers recommend it
[18:13:35] <imsky> good designers
[18:13:37] <imsky> with macbooks
[18:13:44] <imsky> macbook$
[18:13:46] <abjorn> mostly because I never end up doing sites that should matter in mobile browsers
[18:13:52] <imsky> well it's not that
[18:13:57] <imsky> you focus on the important stuff
[18:14:01] <abjorn> oh
[18:14:03] <imsky> and leave all the decorative crap
[18:14:04] <abjorn> well yeah that
[18:14:09] <abjorn> I try that at first
[18:14:10] <abjorn> and then
[18:14:11] <abjorn> im like
[18:14:18] <abjorn> "I suck at actual design so im gonna make it all pretty"
[18:14:25] <imsky> hmm
[18:14:30] <imsky> look at apple when in doubt
[18:14:31] <abjorn> "with images!"
[18:14:34] <abjorn> "and rounded corners!"
[18:14:40] <abjorn> "and text shadow!"
[18:14:43] <imsky> wooo
[18:14:44] <imsky> oh man
[18:14:47] <imsky> have you seen the new phpmyadmin?
[18:14:51] <abjorn> course
[18:14:55] <abjorn> I see it every day brah
[18:14:56] <imsky> BOX SHADOWWWW
[18:14:58] <abjorn> you forget whereI work?
[18:15:02] <imsky> in a box?
[18:15:04] <imsky> with shadows?
[18:15:07] <abjorn> yes
[18:15:15] <abjorn> but no yeah i see it every day at work
[18:15:19] <abjorn> everyone was all
[18:15:26] <abjorn> "ew i hate the new one, i like the old one better"
[18:15:27] <abjorn> and im like
[18:15:34] <abjorn> "...this is better......."
[18:15:40] <imsky> lol
[18:15:47] <imsky> what are you gonna do
[18:15:48] <abjorn> psh they just hate change
[18:15:50] <imsky> people are tards
[18:15:58] <abjorn> just like everyone who bitches every few months when facebook changed their layout
[18:16:04] <abjorn> and im all
[18:16:08] <abjorn> "whateva i dont even care"
[18:16:11] <imsky> lolol
[18:16:44] <abjorn> or when people are like
[18:16:49] <abjorn> "wahhh netflix costs more"
[18:16:50] <abjorn> and im all
[18:17:01] <abjorn> "nigga it was a steal before, shut yo mouth"
[18:17:15] <imsky> netflix actually cancelled my account in like 2009
[18:17:22] <abjorn> lol why
[18:17:25] <imsky> i got tired of paying so they were like "naw"
[18:17:30] <abjorn> well yeah
[18:17:40] <imsky> i haven't felt the urge to hand them more stacks recently
[18:17:43] <abjorn> interestingly we only cancel accounts at work like
[18:17:45] <abjorn> every 8 months
[18:17:57] <imsky> hmm
[18:18:00] <abjorn> every now and then we're like
[18:18:09] <abjorn> "you know we should probably clean up those suspended accounts that haven't paid."
[18:18:21] <imsky> clean the gutters
[18:18:34] <abjorn> except it's hardly cleaning because the accounts are still there in the system
[18:18:38] <abjorn> they're just listed as "canceled"
[18:18:46] <abjorn> well that and we delete them off the servers
[18:19:12] <imsky> anyone really rich ever not pay?
[18:19:25] <abjorn> idk I've never known of anyone really rich that uses hostgator
[18:19:34] <abjorn> it's lik
[18:19:34] <abjorn> e
[18:19:39] <abjorn> personal use, small business
[18:19:44] <abjorn> occasionally medium sized businesses
[18:20:13] <imsky> hmm why you no update your blog
[18:20:21] <abjorn> idk dawg i havent had shit to say
[18:20:22] <imsky> it's looking staler than year old oreo cookies
[18:20:37] <abjorn> I can't actually write that much about work on there, NDA and all
[18:20:41] <imsky> just like post shit you're working on
[18:20:49] <imsky> your couchdb crap
[18:20:50] <abjorn> I suuuppoooossseee
[18:20:58] <imsky> haha
[18:21:02] <abjorn> I really need to finish bug testing the browser end of sofajs
[18:21:06] <imsky> ye ye
[18:21:13] <abjorn> so lazy
[18:21:16] <imsky> hmm i think we've taken over #jquery
[18:21:21] <abjorn> im too busy playing LoL and my 3DS
[18:21:31] <abjorn> well if we weren't here no one would be talking
[18:21:37] <imsky> shit that's true
[18:21:46] <imsky> i wonder if i'm missing anything...
[18:21:52] <imsky> because i never owned a dedicated gaming device
[18:21:54] <abjorn> it'd be quieter than #node.js used to be
[18:21:57] <imsky> like a gameboy or a 3ds
[18:22:07] <abjorn> shit dog
[18:22:09] <abjorn> you're missing out
[18:22:10] <imsky> pc gamer 4 lyfe
[18:22:16] <imsky> oh i do own a wii though
[18:22:20] <abjorn> I mean i pc game out the ass
[18:22:21] <abjorn> but
[18:22:27] <abjorn> i grew up with nintendo handhelds
[18:22:34] <abjorn> gameboy pocket sooonnn
[18:22:34] <imsky> yeah i guess i never got into that
[18:22:48] <abjorn> gba sonnnn
[18:22:55] <imsky> lol i feel content though
[18:22:57] <abjorn> then i skipped the ds and dsi...
[18:23:00] <abjorn> then i got a 3ds!
[18:23:05] <imsky> holy shit nboyeeeee
[18:23:10] <imsky> shittin' boy?
[18:23:17] <abjorn> I skipepd those because i discovered emulators
[18:23:24] <abjorn> so i could play the games on computer anyways
[18:23:27] <abjorn> but
[18:23:31] <imsky> oh yeah, you see the jaboscript nintendo emulator?
[18:23:32] <abjorn> you can't emulate 3D son!
[18:23:37] <abjorn> yeah i think so
[18:23:38] <imsky> lol wat
[18:23:40] <abjorn> maybe
[18:23:40] <imsky> yeah you can
[18:23:43] <imsky> we got wobgl
[18:23:48] <imsky> the dubstep graphics library
[18:23:48] <abjorn> no i mean
[18:23:54] <abjorn> the stereoscopic 3d screen
[18:23:56] <abjorn> on the 3ds
[18:24:02] <imsky> psht sgsjmd gttttfttt
[18:24:07] <imsky> ok maybe not that
[18:24:10] <abjorn> lol yeah
[18:24:23] <abjorn> until we have stereoscopic monitors :D
[18:24:27] <abjorn> in 2030
[18:24:30] <imsky> hmm i shall check these gaming devices out
[18:24:42] <imsky> though i anticipate much disappointment
[18:24:45] <abjorn> I have a Wii and a 360 but I never play them.
[18:24:55] <imsky> wait a sec, i have a smartphone
[18:24:56] <abjorn> Well the 3DS was an early buy for me, I shoulda waited longer
[18:25:00] <imsky> why the hell do i need a gameboy
[18:25:01] <abjorn> because there still aren't many good games for it
[18:25:06] <abjorn> other than actual DS games
[18:25:12] <imsky> oh ye ye word up
[18:25:15] <imsky> that's another thing
[18:25:19] <imsky> nintendo buttscrews you
[18:25:25] <abjorn> there's only two good 3DS games out right now, and they're both remakes of classic N64 games
[18:25:36] <abjorn> Ocarina of Time 3D and Star Fox 64 3D
[18:25:41] <abjorn> which are awesome btw
[18:25:41] <imsky> you should hack your 3ds
[18:25:46] <abjorn> I've considered it
[18:25:51] <abjorn> I used to do homebrew ds
[18:25:53] <abjorn> games
[18:25:59] <imsky> word up
[18:26:02] <imsky> hmm
[18:26:05] <imsky> since you do have a wii
[18:26:12] <imsky> you can use a js api to interface with the wiimote
[18:26:21] <abjorn> really?
[18:26:23] <abjorn> neat
[18:26:28] <imsky> yeah that's been around for years
[18:26:30] <imsky> it works, too
[18:26:37] <imsky> good old opera
[18:26:55] <abjorn> llol
[18:26:57] <imsky> i might get into it and build asteroids or something
[18:27:25] <abjorn> reminds me, i really need to start up my javascript game engine again
[18:27:31] <imsky> fuck yea boyyy
[18:27:32] <imsky> you get the new windows 8?
[18:27:36] <abjorn> nope
[18:27:40] <imsky> you should
[18:27:47] <imsky> it is totally tits
[18:27:50] <abjorn> I put it on hiatus because I wanted to switch to NodeJS as the platform, and needed to wait for windows support but
[18:27:56] <imsky> bro
[18:27:56] <abjorn> turns out node just isnt the platform for it
[18:28:02] <abjorn> trying to fit a game loop into that system is just
[18:28:02] <imsky> jaboscript in metro
[18:28:03] <abjorn> like
[18:28:05] <abjorn> just no
[18:28:09] <imsky> lol
[18:28:19] <abjorn> so I'm just going to try and emulate some of the node environment
[18:28:23] <imsky> :(
[18:28:26] <imsky> building a legacy
[18:28:27] <abjorn> mostly just the commonjs module stuff
[18:28:31] <imsky> a legacy of crap
[18:28:34] <abjorn> which i already have
[18:28:37] <abjorn> mostly
[18:28:45] <abjorn> not in the strictest sense >.>
[18:28:50] <imsky> ror
[18:28:56] <abjorn> ror
[18:29:06] <imsky> hmm
[18:29:07] <abjorn> man  we had a lot of ruby on rails questions at work today
[18:29:08] <abjorn> was weird
[18:29:16] <imsky> oh god, don't bring work in here
[18:29:19] <abjorn> lol
[18:29:23] <imsky> my main project is a ror project
[18:29:30] <abjorn> :o
[18:29:40] <imsky> that thing shits itself on the drop of a dime
[18:29:43] <imsky> i yearn for php
[18:29:47] <abjorn> lol
[18:29:49] <imsky> "SHIT'S BROKEN BUT I'M PROCESSING"
[18:29:52] <abjorn> I yearn
[18:29:54] <abjorn> for nodejs
[18:30:07] <imsky> hmm
[18:30:14] <imsky> you think it's ever gonna be popular?
[18:30:25] <abjorn> I remember like my first week there, someone had a nodejs question, wanted to know if we supported it
[18:30:30] <abjorn> never heard anything more after that
[18:30:39] <imsky> ^ that's why it's not going to be popular
[18:30:47] <imsky> until microsoft or google says "yep we're doing it"
[18:30:48] <abjorn> eh, well you can on vps or dedi
[18:31:04] <abjorn> and node already has a lot of following
[18:31:08] <abjorn> more than i thought it would
[18:31:12] <imsky> joyent i think has the best support, rite?
[18:31:44] <abjorn> lol
[18:31:54] <imsky> :(
[18:32:03] <abjorn> the same as any of the other 20 copycat node hosting platforms
[18:32:10] <imsky> but joyent has the cleanest design
[18:32:14] <abjorn> there's like 4957236589732645 heroku's for node
[18:32:14] <imsky> and and and
[18:32:18] <imsky> haha
[18:32:30] <abjorn> INCLUDING heroku
[18:32:36] <Brendo> Hi
[18:32:37] <imsky> there's a heroku for heroku?
[18:32:45] <webPragmatist> is there something special i have to do when running compatibility mode with jquery?
[18:32:48] <webPragmatist> for plugins specifically
[18:32:53] <imsky> holy fuck where did you people come from
[18:32:55] <abjorn> no but heroku supports node
[18:32:56] <Brendo> Looking for assistance with tablesorter
[18:32:58] <abjorn> is what i meant
[18:33:03] <abjorn> also wtf compatibility mode?
[18:33:09] <imsky> this isnt windows bro
[18:33:10] <abjorn> you mean
[18:33:13] <abjorn> noConflict()?
[18:33:15] <webPragmatist> no conflict
[18:33:15] <imsky> LATEST VERSION OR SHENS
[18:33:16] <coldhead> abjorn: i was just linking you to cutting edge JS data, by a JS tragic, for JS tragics
[18:33:23] <coldhead> we were talking about such things
[18:33:26] <abjorn> oh yeah rofl
[18:33:28] <abjorn> no i saw that
[18:33:30] <abjorn> ala twitter
[18:33:36] <abjorn> and no, webPragmatist
[18:33:39] <abjorn> you dont need to do anything
[18:33:41] <webPragmatist> hrm
[18:33:45] <coldhead> you would have seen it via irc first
[18:33:47] <abjorn> assuming the plugin wasnt programmed by a retard
[18:33:51] <imsky> ^ it is
[18:33:53] <webPragmatist> simplemodal says no function...
[18:34:01] <abjorn> then simplemodal is dum
[18:34:06] <imsky> jquery plugins have a simple quality function
[18:34:11] <abjorn> any good plugin doesn't use $, it uses jQuery
[18:34:28] <imsky> function quality(plugin){ return plugin.madeByBenAlman?100:0;}
[18:34:34] <abjorn> roflmao
[18:34:44] <abjorn> coldhead: well I didn't see it via irc first OKAY
[18:34:54] <abjorn> I actually looked at those slides right before that conversation last night
[18:35:03] <Brendo> When tablesorter sorts a column with percentage, in IE it sorts weird - 0, 100, 2, 21, 4, etc
[18:35:05] <coldhead> as if you even did
[18:35:06] <imsky> can we make ben alman a meme
[18:35:10] <coldhead> they weren't online then
[18:35:12] <imsky> just to have one
[18:35:14] <coldhead> OH CAN WE CAN WE
[18:35:16] <Brendo> Any ideas?
[18:35:19] <abjorn> I vote yes
[18:35:20] <coldhead> ben_alman: ^^
[18:35:31] <cirwin> http://jsfiddle.net/LBhgd/ <-- how am I supposed to use ajaxComplete?
[18:35:33] <imsky> he'll be our chuck norris
[18:35:55] <abjorn> all of a sudden people are asking questions
[18:36:00] <imsky> it's all because of us bro
[18:36:03] <imsky> bump it o/
[18:36:06] <abjorn> wheres ben_alman to make a plugin to answer their questions?
[18:36:08] <dismist> what is the meaning of life
[18:36:21] <imsky> ben alman knows
[18:36:24] <Brendo> Any idea on my tablesorter issue, cunts?
[18:36:34] <abjorn> well that isn't going to get me to answer it brendo
[18:36:34] <imsky> Brendo: whoa that just cost you the producer slot
[18:36:34] <abjorn> rofl
[18:36:35] <webPragmatist> simplemodal uses jQuery
[18:36:46] <abjorn> Wats simplemodal sayin
[18:36:52] <abjorn> whats the error
[18:36:52] <abjorn> bro
[18:37:02] <webPragmatist> jQuery('#productOptions').modal(); << not a function
[18:37:05] <imsky> lolol
[18:37:07] <Brendo> Just getting your attention
[18:37:17] <abjorn> anyways, no im not sure about that brendo
[18:37:22] <imsky> i like the arrogance of .modal()
[18:37:26] <webPragmatist> ya heh
[18:37:27] <abjorn> the arrogance?
[18:37:28] <imsky> no way will any other plugin think about that
[18:37:32] <abjorn> hahaha
[18:37:32] <imsky> or use that
[18:37:44] <webPragmatist> anyway....
[18:37:54] <webPragmatist> dumb conventions asside
[18:37:54] <imsky> webPragmatist: it's not linked in properly mayne
[18:37:59] <Brendo> Or, any ideas where tiger support for tablesorter- the site suggested here
[18:38:00] <imsky> you're missing the file
[18:38:05] <webPragmatist> :( i'm not heh
[18:38:11] <imsky> yeah you are
[18:38:15] <imsky> or you're including it wrong
[18:38:20] <abjorn> or its broken
[18:38:24] <imsky> or it's a bokeh
[18:38:25] <imsky> filter
[18:38:34] <abjorn> ben_alman: ^^
[18:38:52] <imsky> ben alman solves world problems with .noConflict
[18:38:57] <abjorn> exactly
[18:39:01] <abjorn> also with plugins
[18:39:24] <imsky> simplemodal looks like a total turdnugget
[18:39:34] <webPragmatist> crap you are right
[18:39:40] <imsky> http://leanmodal.finelysliced.com.au/
[18:39:43] <imsky> ^ for u bro
[18:40:00] <Brendo> IR-frigging-C -I remember this from back in the day when this was like the internet - now it's just lame as poo
[18:40:03] <webPragmatist> o my god this packet has to travel accross the pacific
[18:40:09] <abjorn> shit dog
[18:40:10] <imsky> simple modal is 9K minified!!
[18:40:13] <abjorn> bookmarkd that modal
[18:40:16] <imsky> leanmodal is less than 1k
[18:40:30] <abjorn> psh, everyone uses IRC now, to be ironic, brendo
[18:40:38] <abjorn> hipsters be bringing it back
[18:40:38] <imsky> yeah we're all wearing mustache sunglasses
[18:40:42] <imsky> {B-)
[18:41:01] <abjorn> what
[18:41:02] <abjorn> theres
[18:41:02] <abjorn> a
[18:41:06] <Brendo> Anyway - Jquery tablesorter support - where from?
[18:41:07] <abjorn> bjornbjorn in here
[18:41:09] <abjorn> i call foul play
[18:41:14] <imsky> bjornbjorn: ben alman sent you didn't he
[18:41:20] <abjorn> lmfao
[18:41:36] <imsky> Brendo: what's your issue, soldier
[18:41:41] <imsky> what complaint would you like to file
[18:41:42] <abjorn> his table sorts weird in IE
[18:41:45] <imsky> he's a dick
[18:41:51] <imsky> that's the problem
[18:41:59] <abjorn> I'm just gonna go ahead and describe that as being IE's fault and move on
[18:42:14] <imsky> idgaf
[18:42:26] <imsky> \( o)/
[18:42:36] <imsky> also +n+(?_?)+n+
[18:42:40] <Brendo> In IE - tablesorter column with % sorts like 0, 100, 2, 40, 5, etc
[18:42:51] <imsky> yeahh?
[18:43:03] <Brendo> Yep
[18:43:06] <imsky> wat
[18:43:13] <imsky> are you talking some garbage
[18:43:27] <Brendo> No
[18:44:17] <Brendo> It sorts it like text. Can I specify a column to be a percentage?
[18:44:19] <imsky> abjorn: can you program a multiplayer node game?
[18:44:32] <imsky> Brendo: probably not because tablesorter is older than ronald reagan
[18:44:40] <abjorn> probably
[18:44:46] <imsky> hmm i'm thinking

[18:47:52] <coldhead> it's verboten
[18:47:58] <imsky> what about protein carbs
[18:48:03] <Brodingo> smoked chicken jalapeno raviolis
[18:48:05] <abjorn> or write the unit tests in the function idk either one

[18:51:28] <Brendo> Thanks again, cyas
[18:51:31] <imsky> later
[18:52:34] <abjorn> use transitions for reflows?
[18:52:37] <imsky> yeah
[18:52:38] <abjorn> hmm
[18:52:45] <imsky> if you have the latest chrome, they use it for frequently used sites
[18:52:57] <imsky> or at least i think they do
[18:53:03] <imsky> they could just use some jquery masonry crap
[18:53:19] <imsky> but i want to be script-free
[18:54:02] <abjorn> idk you know more about css than me
[18:54:06] <imsky> fffuuu
[18:54:16] <abjorn> man that MXES thing in your portfolio
[18:54:22] <abjorn> looks like one complex app
[18:54:22] <webPragmatist> jQuery('#productOptions').leanModal();                .. the dumb thing is loaded
[18:54:30] <webPragmatist> << is just complaining now
[18:54:37] <abjorn> lol
[18:54:40] <imsky> abjorn: it was a team of i think 20-30 people working internationally on it
[18:54:44] <TrueColors> Uncaught typerror: number is not a function
[18:54:47] <abjorn> go figure
[18:55:08] <abjorn> ewww you create a flash application?
[18:55:11] <imsky> HEY
[18:55:12] <imsky> HEY
[18:55:13] <abjorn> ewwwww
[18:55:16] <imsky> i don't do that anymore
[18:55:17] <imsky> i'm clean
[18:55:21] <abjorn> oh okay
[18:55:23] <imsky> sober since '07
[18:55:26] <abjorn> as long as you've changed you ways
[18:55:29] <imsky> i have
[18:55:35] <TrueColors> onclick="scrollTop();" produces "number is not a function" why?
[18:55:41] <TrueColors> I do have.. function scrollTop ( ) { ... }
[18:55:43] <abjorn> http://imsky.co/portfolio/m3uMove
[18:55:43] <abjorn> Narwhal? Naaaarrrwhaaaalll???!?!!
[18:55:47] <imsky> hahah
[18:55:49] <imsky> it's dead i know
[18:55:54] <imsky> or at least inactive
[18:56:00] <imsky> but all commonjs engines can run it
[18:56:10] <abjorn> @TrueColors: Why use onclick attribute?
[18:56:13] <abjorn> If you'
[18:56:16] <abjorn> If you'
[18:56:18] <abjorn> ugh
[18:56:19] <abjorn> cant type
[18:56:20] <imsky> wut
[18:56:27] <abjorn> If you're gonna use jQuery then why bother using onclick
[18:56:37] <abjorn> use jQuery to bind an event handler
[18:56:40] <coldhead> your body refuses to even discuss onClick
[18:56:44] <abjorn> It really does
[18:56:44] <imsky> narwhal baby
[18:56:48] <abjorn> or at least my pinky does
[18:56:54] <abjorn> aka my enter finger
[18:57:06] <abjorn> I'm getting too used to the keyboards at work
[18:57:11] <imsky> what kind are they
[18:57:12] <abjorn> we use weird ergo keyboards
[18:57:13] <imsky> dell or microsoft
[18:57:16] <abjorn> microsoft
[18:57:18] <TrueColors> but either way... why should that case an error
[18:57:19] <TrueColors> cause*
[18:57:20] <imsky> well score 1 there
[18:57:23] <imsky> ms keyboards rock
[18:57:27] <abjorn> they do
[18:57:31] <imsky> using one right now
[18:57:34] <abjorn> theyre great keyboards
[18:57:43] <abjorn> but very different from my logitech G15 lol
[18:57:47] <imsky> ye ye
[18:57:48] <webPragmatist> that leanmodal worked as good as a 100 old wang
[18:58:04] <abjorn> TrueColors: something is interfering with the value of scrollTop
[18:58:12] <imsky> webPragmatist: your problem is the age-old case of pbkac
[18:58:20] <imsky> or even pebkac
[18:58:23] <TrueColors> $("body").scrollTop(0);
[18:58:24] <TrueColors> ...
[18:58:24] <abjorn> 100 year old wang works fine with modern medicine
[18:58:26] <abjorn> thanks viagra!
[18:58:29] <TrueColors> that should work, right?
[18:58:48] <imsky> no
[18:58:50] <imsky> it shouldn't
[18:59:11] <webPragmatist> nah pbkac is only a contributing factor
[18:59:16] <TrueColors> Why not? The docs have the same usage eg: $("div.demo").scrollTop(300);
[18:59:17] <abjorn> if you have a function added to jQuery.fn called scrollTop, possibly
[18:59:22] <imsky> maybe you should just hire me, webPragmatist
[18:59:32] <webPragmatist> i'll give you two dollars
[18:59:42] <imsky> that buys one second of my time
[18:59:46] <TrueColors> I've called functions from an onclick which had js in.. :/
[18:59:46] <imsky> ready?
[18:59:47] <abjorn> lol
[19:00:06] <webPragmatist> i wish i made 1200 an hour
[19:00:10] <webPragmatist> 1300*
[19:00:11] <imsky> $7200
[19:00:21] <imsky> if you're good at math, you might
[19:00:26] <abjorn> lol
[19:00:28] <webPragmatist> nah
[19:00:31] <webPragmatist> math and i have issues
[19:00:51] <imsky> i wonder how much advice i can give in one second
[19:00:57] <imsky> i'd have to use a very precise word
[19:01:03] <abjorn> "ben alman"
[19:01:12] <imsky> oh man i can do that all day
[19:01:15] <webPragmatist> rm -rf *
[19:01:22] <imsky> wat
[19:01:26] <webPragmatist> fixes it
[19:01:30] <imsky> sudo rm -rf .
[19:01:32] <abjorn> oops i accidentally the whole jquery
[19:01:34] <imsky> you nob
[19:01:39] <webPragmatist> ya blobbing ftl
[19:01:53] <webPragmatist> sudo rm -rf / probably safer
[19:01:54] <abjorn> you don't need sudo if you have root bro
[19:02:00] <imsky> sudo su then
[19:02:01] <imsky> biatch
[19:02:14] <abjorn> lol that is not at all safer
[19:02:18] <webPragmatist> for me
[19:02:22] <abjorn> it'd do the same
[19:02:25] <imsky> ye i know
[19:02:28] <imsky> not trying to be safer
[19:02:31] <imsky> trying to get dangerous
[19:02:34] <abjorn> lol
[19:03:14] <imsky> hmm
[19:03:33] <imsky> you guys see that article on using .svg files as css backgrounds?
[19:03:40] <imsky> totally destroys the need for css gradients
[19:03:57] <abjorn> :o
[19:03:59] <abjorn> i did not
[19:04:01] <abjorn> but that's
[19:04:03] <abjorn> a brilliant idea
[19:04:04] <imsky> ya welcome to the future
[19:04:11] <webPragmatist> 	i really don't get it though this leanmodal runs but it doesn't display crpa
[19:04:12] <webPragmatist> crap(
[19:04:17] <abjorn> why did no one think of that first?
[19:04:22] <abjorn> why didn't I think of that?
[19:04:23] <imsky> svg support is shitty
[19:04:25] <imsky> http://designfestival.com/a-farewell-to-css3-gradients/
[19:04:27] <abjorn> true
[19:04:30] <imsky> but since we're all cutting edge
[19:04:31] <imsky> who cares
[19:04:43] <abjorn> lol farewell to css gradients before they're even supported everywhere
[19:04:46] <CannedCorn> hey guys
[19:04:50] <abjorn> also, yeah, css gradients are shit to write
[19:04:59] <CannedCorn> having a hell of a time trying to get google's places autocomplete api to work
[19:05:00] <imsky> webPragmatist: seriously, i can help you for a bit of dough
[19:05:05] <CannedCorn> foursquare works just fine
[19:05:07] <imsky> abjorn: gonna fix that with cssFx bra
[19:05:12] <webPragmatist> no esc support either
[19:05:15] <CannedCorn> it says Origin http://localhost:3000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[19:05:27] <imsky> CannedCorn: google SOP
[19:05:28] <abjorn> that SOP is a bitch
[19:05:33] <imsky> legit mates
[19:05:54] <CannedCorn> i know of it, the same exact code works to get JSON from foursquare's autocomplete API
[19:06:03] <CannedCorn> in the same broswer
[19:06:08] <imsky> man you got canned corn in your ears
[19:06:12] <abjorn> lol
[19:06:13] <imsky> your digital ears
[19:06:14] <CannedCorn> they don't support JSONP
[19:06:21] <imsky> aka your eyes
[19:06:22] <webPragmatist> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/vl6ihu5kmrjirt4xqstcia <<
[19:06:24] <CannedCorn> google doesn't at least, so i'm kind of in a rut here
[19:06:38] <imsky> webPragmatist: nice .ready handler bro
[19:06:38] <abjorn> google doesnt and foursquare does?
[19:06:40] <webPragmatist> ya
[19:06:46] <imsky> ya i totally see it
[19:06:46] <webPragmatist> i tried it in a ready
[19:06:48] <imsky> it's totally visible
[19:07:00] <webPragmatist> but this is after the element inline so i figured it would work
[19:07:05] <imsky> :(
[19:07:36] <CannedCorn> imsky and the request works when typing it into the url bar
[19:07:37] <imsky> abjorn: check out the example: http://www.sitepoint.com/examples/svg/thewall.html
[19:07:37] <CannedCorn> !
[19:07:44] <imsky> CannedCorn: yeah it would
[19:07:55] <imsky> abjorn: all css and svg bro
[19:07:58] <abjorn> CannedCorn: http://alexsexton.com/?p=168
[19:08:06] <abjorn> best I can do for you
[19:08:11] <imsky> i think we're at the same point as we were in 1997 as far as multimedia capabilities
[19:08:16] <imsky> good times
[19:08:18] <abjorn> lol
[19:08:23] <CannedCorn> ok so why would two services, both returning JSON (no P) work differently on the same browser with almost the same query code
[19:08:28] <CannedCorn> it's the server side complaining yes?
[19:08:29] <TrueColors> so I now have: $(".scrollTop").click(function(){ 	$(window).scrollTop(0); });
[19:08:31] <TrueColors> but that doens't scroll top :/
[19:08:36] <imsky> is monday noob night?
[19:08:39] <TrueColors> especially smooth scrolling anyway
[19:08:40] <imsky> i'm so not up for it
[19:08:54] <webPragmatist> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/kfvuyvxklo2ra0pfkgi5q
[19:09:17] <imsky> abjorn: brilliant idea: Angry Turds
[19:09:27] <CannedCorn> imsky and abjorn i'm aware of the same origin policy and don't need to watch video on it, what i'm wondering is why one works and one doesn't why is google denying my request
[19:09:28] <abjorn> oh jesus
[19:09:33] <CannedCorn> it might be SOP
[19:09:39] <abjorn> that's not a video on what SOP is
[19:09:42] <imsky> CannedCorn: i dunno bro idgaf
[19:09:42] <TrueColors> $("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, "slow"); still doesn't even scroll :/
[19:09:43] <abjorn> It's a video on how to get around it
[19:09:47] <CannedCorn> in fact, it is, but then why would foursquare's autocomplete work
[19:09:48] <TrueColors> like seriously... wtf
[19:09:54] <CannedCorn> abjorn ok cool
[19:10:38] <abjorn> probably doesn't work because scrollTop isn't a css property, TrueColors.
[19:10:50] <imsky> you can set it as one though
[19:10:57] <imsky> i herd it from ben alman
[19:11:28] <abjorn> well if ben alman said it
[19:11:44] <TrueColors> abjorn: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1144805/how-do-i-scroll-to-the-top-of-the-page-with-jquery
[19:11:47] <TrueColors> that post states it :/
[19:11:51] <TrueColors> a couple of them.. actually
[19:12:13] <abjorn> thats all youre trying to do, truecolors?
[19:12:16] <abjorn> scroll to the top of the page?
[19:12:17] <imsky> MONDAY NIGHT NOOBBALL
[19:12:22] <TrueColors> ya, a smooth scorll
[19:12:25] <TrueColors> doesn't do a thing :/
[19:12:30] <imsky> abjorn: next superbowl is in indianapolis bro
[19:12:34] <abjorn> jQuery.animate won't do that out of the box
[19:12:45] <abjorn> imsky: I'm not a sports fan so
[19:12:47] <imsky> :(
[19:13:16] <imsky> wait hold on
[19:13:26] <TrueColors> I've also done $("html, body").scrollTop(0); which... also doesn't do a thing
[19:13:27] <imsky> >:(D
[19:13:36] <imsky> angrily sad fat guy
[19:13:45] <imsky> TrueColors: u r bad at jaboquery
[19:14:01] <TrueColors> I haven't worked in it for a while... plus I've never bothered with scroll functiosn
[19:14:11] <TrueColors> I'm only going by what the docs say..
[19:14:13] <abjorn> You're going to need to write your own function to smooth-scroll to the top of the page unless you want to look for one around the interbutts.
[19:14:38] <TrueColors> ok, but how would I... scroll to the top that's not smooth?
[19:14:57] <abjorn> do what now
[19:15:14] <TrueColors> scroll to top without the smooth scrolling..
[19:15:20] <TrueColors> I'm pretty confident I made that clear
[19:15:20] <abjorn> window.scrollTo(0); will scroll to the top immediately
[19:15:53] <abjorn> that's not jquery btw thats just the dom
[19:16:07] <TrueColors> that does nothing :/
[19:16:17] <TrueColors> http://87.102.67.226/projects/HSN/V2/index.php resize browser or whatever to bring up the scrollbar.
[19:16:22] <TrueColors> and go down to the footer
[19:18:15] <abjorn> where are you doing window.scrollTo?
[19:18:22] <TrueColors> common.js
[19:18:50] * TrueColors facepalm
[19:18:54] <TrueColors> I need document.ready don't I?
[19:19:01] <abjorn> yes
[19:19:02] <abjorn> yes you do
[19:19:19] <abjorn> or put your javascript at the bottom of the page, either one
[19:19:55] <TrueColors> I did.. $(function() { ... })
[19:19:58] <TrueColors> but still didn't work :/
[19:20:05] <imsky> TrueColors: http://jsfiddle.net/F8jvW/
[19:20:32] <imsky> lol interbuttsa
[19:20:32] <abjorn> that is an awful example imsky
[19:20:39] <imsky> well i was in a hurry
[19:20:39] <abjorn> it doesn't work
[19:20:41] <abjorn> lol
[19:20:42] <imsky> ye it does
[19:20:46] <TrueColors> no it doesn't..
[19:20:53] <imsky> firefox 6 bitch
[19:20:56] <imsky> UPGRAYEDD
[19:20:57] <TrueColors> chrome
[19:21:13] <abjorn> chromez
[19:21:22] <imsky> aww you guys are with the google mafia
[19:21:29] <abjorn> ya son
[19:21:36] <TrueColors> but yes, in firefox it does work...
[19:21:37] <imsky> nevar fear
[19:21:41] <abjorn> im with the chrome dev tools gang
[19:21:42] <imsky> just replace it with "body"
[19:22:07] <imsky> now your precious chrome works
[19:22:09] <__null> abjorn is there a way to pause all content on the page? like running javascript and etc
[19:22:19] <__null> because sometimes i want to view elements in a slideshow js script but its difficult
[19:22:20] <abjorn> why use "html" anyways, imsky
[19:22:32] <imsky> FOR SUPPORT
[19:22:32] <TrueColors> now it works.
[19:22:40] <__null> well, its not difficult.. but i have to find the code manually
[19:22:47] <TrueColors> i could of sworn I tried that... well ... I did actually, just without document.ready -.-
[19:22:50] <TrueColors> Always forget that
[19:23:00] <abjorn> pause all content...uhhhh
[19:23:02] <imsky> you should use "html,body" tho
[19:23:07] <abjorn> not that I know of, __null
[19:23:12] <TrueColors> ya, I did put that in imsky
[19:23:19] <imsky> u r a champ bro
[19:23:25] <imsky> and f u abjorn
[19:23:28] <imsky> "awful example"
[19:23:33] <abjorn> IT DIDNT WORK
[19:23:39] <imsky> you can't rush a genius
[19:23:43] <imsky> but you can rush me
[19:23:45] <imsky> i think
[19:23:51] <imsky> not in a sexual way
[19:24:47] <TrueColors> abjorn, it appears html works with firefox, body works with chrome. so ... gotta specify both to get it to wrk on both.
[19:24:48] <TrueColors> blah
[19:24:53] <TrueColors> browsers annoy me
[19:24:54] <imsky> YEP DUMBASS
[19:24:59] <imsky> THAT'S WHY
[19:25:00] <abjorn> SHUT UP IMSKY
[19:25:03] <imsky> lololol
[19:25:13] <imsky> i get the strange feeling you've never done a scrollTop before, abjorn
[19:25:21] <abjorn> I really haven't
[19:25:27] <abjorn> window.scrollTo i have
[19:25:29] <abjorn> ;(
[19:25:31] <imsky> what do you use jquery for then
[19:25:35] <abjorn> for
[19:25:38] <abjorn> queries
[19:25:41] <imsky> :(
[19:25:46] <imsky> :U
[19:25:57] <abjorn> for jew queries
[19:26:03] <imsky> my queries, let me show you them
[19:26:26] <abjorn> not on the first date
[19:26:41] <imsky> hmm i forget why it's called jquery
[19:26:45] <imsky> isn't it because of xpath
[19:26:54] <imsky> or xquery
[19:27:13] <abjorn> fuck that x shit
[19:27:18] <imsky> fuck it in the throat
[19:27:21] <abjorn> srsly
[19:27:29] <imsky> the side of the throat
[19:27:33] <imsky> not like the inner part
[19:27:35] <abjorn> probably called jQuery cause it sounded cool
[19:27:45] <bitwise_> anyone using tooltip from the tools lib? Im noticing my tips are way off where they should be showing. this is when i do custom html in them.
[19:27:46] <imsky> no i'm pretty sure it was because of xquery
[19:27:52] <imsky> jeresig dropped xpath support some time after
[19:27:54] <abjorn> i suppose
[19:27:56] <imsky> so i guess the name is legacy
[19:28:04] <topriddy> why do i get event not defined when i try this: jQuery(event.target).closest("td").is("td:nth-child(5)")
[19:28:25] <imsky> that shit
[19:28:28] <abjorn> jsfiddle that dawg @topriddy
[19:28:30] <imsky> looks mad shit
[19:28:53] <abjorn> I can't tell you why it's not defined when I have no context for it
[19:29:14] <CannedCorn> abjorn i don't get why one of these apis would work and the other wouldn't. wouldn't the SOP apply to both?
[19:29:31] <abjorn> it should, but I don't know how you're doing it
[19:29:40] <imsky> he's doing it live
[19:29:46] <abjorn> I'd have to see what you're doing
[19:31:12] <abjorn> I found out that http://domain.com:80/ and http://domain.com/ are not the same origin in the eyes of the SOP
[19:31:14] <abjorn> thats pretty balls
[19:31:16] <imsky> next jsconf is in portland :(
[19:31:21] <imsky> abjorn: duh dude
[19:31:24] <abjorn> isn't it always in portland?
[19:31:25] <topriddy> this is what i am doing: jQuery(event.target).closest("td").is("td:nth-child(5)")
[19:31:25] <imsky> same goes for ssl
[19:31:33] <CannedCorn> http://pastie.org/2560939
[19:31:38] <abjorn> well yeah i know http/https is diff origin
[19:31:48] <imsky> where do you think they copied the policies from?
[19:32:11] <imsky> CannedCorn: are you running this from http://localhost
[19:32:14] <CannedCorn> yeah
[19:32:19] <imsky> :(
[19:32:23] <imsky> my soul, it weeps
[19:32:30] <CannedCorn> why?
[19:32:34] <abjorn> and where is the foursquare requests, cannedcorn
[19:32:37] <CannedCorn> thats how people develop rails apps
[19:32:43] <imsky> hmm
[19:32:55] <topriddy> abjorn: here: http://jsfiddle.net/3tVMN/
[19:33:30] <abjorn> click(function(){
[19:33:30] <abjorn>    if(jQuery(event.target).closest("td").is("td:nth-child(5)")){
[19:33:30] <abjorn> you don't see anything wrong there, topriddy?
[19:33:40] <CannedCorn> abjorn reload the pastie
[19:33:41] <CannedCorn> it's there now
[19:33:47] <CannedCorn> so the foursquare one works like a charm
[19:33:53] <topriddy> abjorn: no.
[19:33:55] <imsky> abjorn: how does it feel to be doing tech support in your free time
[19:33:57] <CannedCorn> and the google one bitches at me about SOP
[19:34:05] <abjorn> imsky: I'm not sure how I feel about it/.
[19:34:22] <CannedCorn> its just making a request for json, what is the big friggin deal, must be google denying it because it absolutely works with foursquare
[19:34:23] <abjorn> actually that's kind of weird that the foursquare one doesn't run into SOP issues
[19:34:34] <abjorn> are you sure the foursquare request is even being run?
[19:34:39] <topriddy> abjorn: please what is wrong there?
[19:34:50] <abjorn> actually that's done on the browser end, cannedcorn
[19:34:54] <abjorn> so it's not the server
[19:35:01] <abjorn> topriddy: event isn't defined
[19:35:12] <abjorn> click() doesn't define some magic event variable in the callback
[19:35:19] <abjorn> click(function(event){
[19:35:19] <abjorn>    if(jQuery(event.target).closest("td").is("td:nth-child(5)")){
[19:35:27] <abjorn> you need the event argument
[19:35:57] <CannedCorn> abjorn so how is getting json response from foursquare any different than getting one from google, both running on localhost
[19:36:32] <abjorn> It shouldn't be, I actually am kind of confused why you would be getting any json response from the foursquare request
[19:36:38] <topriddy> abjorn: am not sure what that should be. X_X. what i wanted to do is set a click event on a row and then exempt the 5th column. (would have preffered to identify this 5th column with a class.
[19:36:54] <CannedCorn> abjorn I'm just trying to understand how that works
[19:37:12] <imsky> abjorn: this might be how http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/
[19:37:22] <abjorn> imsky: oh right
[19:37:23] <abjorn> that
[19:37:36] <abjorn> shut up
[19:37:37] <topriddy> maybe i should let my function accept a dom element? or how do i pass in an event to a funtion?
[19:37:46] <imsky> abjorn: you work for a hosting company trolololol
[19:37:51] <abjorn> please
[19:37:57] <abjorn> like they go into http headers in training
[19:37:59] <abjorn> or in anything
[19:38:01] <abjorn> we don't mess with that
[19:38:01] <imsky> lol
[19:38:27] <topriddy> please anybody help? cc abjorn
[19:38:34] <imsky> lol cc abjorn
[19:38:36] <imsky> bcc imsky
[19:38:37] <abjorn> lol cc'ing me in an irc
[19:38:47] <abjorn> I just showed you, topriddy
[19:38:53] <abjorn> instead of this:
[19:38:53] <abjorn> click(function(){
[19:38:53] <abjorn>    if(jQuery(event.target).closest("td").is("td:nth-child(5)")){
[19:38:55] <abjorn> you need
[19:38:59] <abjorn> click(function(event){
[19:38:59] <abjorn>    if(jQuery(event.target).closest("td").is("td:nth-child(5)")){
[19:39:02] <abjorn> see the difference?
[19:39:17] <badabim> I have some questions about deferreds. any experts?
[19:39:38] <Eviltwin> badabim: Just ask your question
[19:39:39] <Spadeski>  /join##php
[19:39:43] <Spadeski> Sup ppl
[19:39:47] <mrdodson> does anyone have an example of sending a POST to a rails app with jquery? I'm just trying to save one piece of data for a user but I can't get the parameters through
[19:40:06] <abjorn> ?post @ mrdodson
[19:40:06] <bot-t> mrdodson, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[19:40:11] <badabim> I would like to run an xhr, and if it fails, run an alternate xhr.
[19:40:29] <badabim> and have things which execute after both/either of them.
[19:40:42] <Eviltwin> badabim: Sounds like you need a fail after your first XHR
[19:40:45] <Eviltwin> That starts the second
[19:40:56] <abjorn> ^
[19:41:11] <badabim> right, but how can a .then() wait for the second to complete as well?
[19:41:12] <abjorn> in that callback just create the second
[19:41:23] <imsky> the wonders of jquery
[19:41:23] <abjorn> hum...
[19:41:29] <Eviltwin> badabim: You're going to need a named function
[19:41:31] <topriddy> do i need to explicitly pass in an event to this function?
[19:41:39] <abjorn> imsky: wonderssss
[19:41:43] <Eviltwin> And call it from the success of the first one or the success of the second
[19:41:47] <abjorn> topriddy: yes
[19:41:49] <imsky> i'm gonna get a Fuze
[19:41:53] <imsky> anyone else want a Fuze?
[19:42:02] <imsky> buy a Fuze today, only 1% juice!
[19:42:08] <abjorn> lol
[19:42:12] <abjorn> I want some water
[19:42:14] <abjorn> is what I want
[19:42:16] <imsky> that Fuze marketing money is rolling in
[19:42:18] <topriddy> abjorn: how? how am i to do it in the html?
[19:42:28] <abjorn> How are you to do what?
[19:42:43] <badabim> I see what you are saying abjorn, but that doesn't allow me to attach a .then() to either one
[19:42:53] <badabim> but actually, I suppose I can just create my own deferred.
[19:43:01] <topriddy> abjorn: how am i to pass the event obj explictly to the click(function(event))
[19:43:10] <badabim> and then mark it as resolved in either success.
[19:43:15] <abjorn> Honestly, badabim, I'm not an expert on deferreds. I've had no chance to really play with it - I so far haven't had anything that needed a deferred.
[19:43:19] <badabim> or failed if both fail.
[19:43:26] <topriddy> because even after making the corrections, it still doesnt work.
[19:43:33] <badabim> sure, they are still new.
[19:43:38] <abjorn> Oh, no, you don't pass it explicitly, sorry topriddy
[19:43:40] <Eviltwin> badabim: What about $.ajax({...}).success(callback).error(function(){$.ajax({...}).success(callback)})
[19:43:40] <abjorn> jquery passes that
[19:43:42] <abjorn> to the function
[19:43:44] <badabim> I am trying to refactor a big mess of callbacks.
[19:43:57] <abjorn> badabim: I hear ya
[19:44:06] <topriddy> abjorn: okay. now am getting error: jQuery(event.target).closest is not a function
[19:44:08] <imsky> a yard of callbacks
[19:44:15] <Eviltwin> abjorn: Nothing strictly needs a deferred but they can be useful when you don't know what might be interested in a piece of information after you've already started the XHR
[19:44:16] <abjorn> did js debugging for a company awhile back that had a bunch of shitty callbacks everywhere, written by outsourced idians
[19:44:23] <abjorn> indians even
[19:44:23] <imsky> abjorn: that's racist
[19:44:25] <abjorn> no
[19:44:28] <abjorn> they actually were indians
[19:44:31] <abjorn> that were outsources
[19:44:34] <imsky> did they own a casino
[19:44:35] <badabim> yes, eviltwin, that is what I am thinking but the callback would set the resolved of a deferred which I would create before either one.
[19:44:45] <imsky> were they aztecs?
[19:44:48] <topriddy> the framework am using is dependent on: jQuery1.2.5
[19:44:50] <rhizmoe> chinook!
[19:44:55] <badabim> so I can return that immediately and other things can be queued off of it.
[19:45:14] <Eviltwin> badabim: Then you're going to make your own deferred and have either trigger it
[19:45:23] <abjorn> imsky: different kind of indian
[19:45:33] <abjorn> dot, not feather
[19:45:34] <badabim> thats right, and the double-failure would reject it.
[19:45:45] <Eviltwin> badabim: Correct
[19:45:55] <Eviltwin> A fail off the second
[19:45:57] <badabim> thanks a bunch. it helps a lot to talk things through.
[19:46:26] <topriddy> abjorn: do you think closest() is a recent addition to jQuery? cos i get the error: jQuery(event.target).closest is not a function
[19:47:28] <abjorn> ?closest
[19:47:28] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:47:39] <abjorn> nope
[19:47:41] <abjorn> since 1.3
[19:49:37] <topriddy> abjorn: the framework am using is dependent on: jQuery1.2.5. anyway i can mix both an higher and lower version of jQuery in same page.
[19:49:50] <imsky> oh lord
[19:50:13] <panfist> i have a feeling i'm doing something very wrong, hopefully someone can suggest a better approach?
[19:50:16] <Eviltwin> .closest had what I would have expected .parentUntil to do
[19:50:29] <panfist> i'm trying to use a user script to automate an activity where i have to navigate a few pages through my printer's web browser
[19:51:54] <panfist> so the extension has a function which will start with adding jquery, opening a new window where i have to start navigating, and then i do a $(child_window.document).ready()
[19:51:55] <imsky> 0_o
[19:52:43] <panfist> except i have to navigate several pages, so within that ready() function i have to inspect the page, decide a new url, and change the .location to that next url
[19:53:02] <panfist> so i'm nesting another $(document).ready() function inside the other one
[19:53:06] <topriddy> ...oh well.
[19:53:07] <topriddy> :(
[19:53:13] <panfist> but i have to repeat this about 5 times...
[19:53:30] <abjorn> what could you possibly be using that is dependent on jquery 1.2.5
[19:53:31] <abjorn> lol
[19:53:41] <imsky> ben alman's dirty secret
[19:53:47] <abjorn> hush you
[19:53:50] <lankastle> hey guys. i'm developing a plugin and trying to make it available to $.myPlugin (called with no selector) to manage the overall state of the plugin (things that don't apply to individual elements) i'm duplicating the method architecture from the plugin authoring page and adding $.myPlugin to the namespace after $.fn.myPlugin, but i'm getting several errors. is the method architecture supposed to work this way?
[19:53:52] <abjorn> we'll never speak of it
[19:53:57] <imsky> si capitan
[19:53:59] <lankastle> is there a better way to do this?
[19:54:07] <imsky> lankastle: i'm not reading that garbage
[19:54:11] <imsky> it's crap
[19:54:22] <abjorn> yes you add functions to jQuery.fn
[19:54:27] <abjorn> jQuery.fn.myPlugin
[19:54:40] <imsky> abjorn: http://lanyrd.com/topics/javascript/in/texas/
[19:54:44] <imsky> check it out ghetto broth
[19:54:45] <imsky> a
[19:54:54] <imsky> jaboscript events in your hood
[19:54:57] <abjorn> seent it
[19:55:01] <abjorn> seen it
[19:55:01] <Lampoon> Sorry, I haven't seen it.
[19:55:02] <imsky> oh you seent it?
[19:55:07] <lankastle> i want to call my plugin without a selector. any advice for how to do this?
[19:55:08] <abjorn> i seent it
[19:55:15] <imsky> abjorn: http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgc7vbuQWJ1qfakt6o1_500.png
[19:55:26] <abjorn> ya
[19:55:26] <abjorn> that
[19:55:35] <lankastle> to setup a Three.js scene, for example
[19:55:43] <imsky> you navigate lanyrd to check out conferences in austin?
[19:55:46] <imsky> just on a whim?
[19:55:52] <abjorn> yes
[19:56:03] * imsky scribbles in notebook
[19:56:16] <imsky> "patient is prone to obsessive behavior"
[19:56:35] <abjorn> lankastle: you can still do $.myPlugin without the $("selector").myPlugin
[19:57:44] <abjorn> although I never understand why plugins do that - you're just stealing the jQuery namespace
[19:58:11] <lankastle> ah okay, what's the best way to see if it was called as $.myPlugin() vs. $("selector").myPlugin()?
[19:58:15] <abjorn> brb thirsty
[19:58:20] <imsky> drink Fuze!
[19:58:29] <abjorn> oh so you want to accomodate both?
[19:58:41] <lankastle> yeah sorry
[19:59:02] <lankastle> this empty selector case being for doing things to the plugin in general, not on a per element basis
[20:00:10] <abjorn> if (this.context === window) { // was passed with $.myPlugin } else { // was passed with selector }
[20:01:00] <lankastle> thank you :)
[20:01:35] <abjorn> oh
[20:01:37] <abjorn> sorry
[20:01:42] <abjorn> if (this.context === document)
[20:01:43] <abjorn> my mistake
[20:02:59] <lankastle> hmm, what about getting separate methods for each? should i just build the check into the methods or perhaps create a separate methods object for each case or perhaps stop stop asking about trivial things
[20:03:03] <topriddy> abjorn: did you see my last message? my framework depends on a lower version of jQuery. am not sure i can mix both.
[20:03:21] <lankastle> specifically after a different init method for each case
[20:03:39] <abjorn> weeeeelllll
[20:03:42] <abjorn> you shouldn't topriddy
[20:03:52] <imsky> you totally should
[20:04:00] <imsky> add a third version too
[20:04:02] <imsky> just for kicks
[20:04:05] <abjorn> In fact I'm like
[20:04:08] <abjorn> 99% sure that wouldn't wokr
[20:04:10] <abjorn> work
[20:04:11] <abjorn> like at all
[20:04:34] <abjorn> noConflict helps you conflict from other libraries that wanna use $
[20:04:38] <abjorn> not so much from other jQuery versions
[20:06:47] <Spadeski>  /join ##design
[20:11:20] <badabim> regarding my earlier question on deferreds, this worked pretty well:
[20:11:22] <badabim> var def = $.Deferred().then(function () { console.log("success"); }, function () { console.log("failure"); });
[20:11:23] <badabim> $.getJSON("bad_file_name.json").then(def.resolve, function () { console.log("falling back"); $.getJSON("good_file_name.json").then(def.resolve, def.reject); });
[20:18:14] <lankastle> abjorn: when i call it like that ( $.myPlugin() ) it says no method named 'myPlugin' exists in the console. any idea?
[20:18:54] <lankastle> $().myPlugin() gives the same results
[20:20:20] <LekeFly> Anyone wanna make 5$ fast via paypal? i have a tiny error on a script ( i can provide the page via pm ) http://cl.ly/1J232F2l3F450x13433D
[20:24:57] <plov> i'm using .post how would i get the response of the server if the .post results in a 500 resp?
[20:25:33] <plov> i pretty much followed the doc in using .error, but i would also like to get the response
[20:28:01] <Eviltwin> plov: .post uses .ajax
[20:38:44] <micro__> does anyone know how i can extract meta tags from response data ( html )?
[20:39:41] <micro__> to an ajax cal
[20:39:43] <micro__> *call
[20:45:01] <micro__> come on guys... im sure one of you has some advice
[20:49:14] <micro__> i think i found a bug in jquery... for some reason i can access tags in the head of the current DOM in the regular fashion
[20:50:38] <micro__> but when i try to do the same in the context of a variable it returns an empty array
[21:00:06] <Spadeski> Hello everyone I would like to make a horizontal line of images and there is 5 i want them to be the users top images and be able to drag and drop the order there in and save in database ?
[21:00:51] <Spadeski> anyone can help me get started i know how to make drag and drop but notsave them
[21:03:43] <micro__> saving to a database will involve some kind of server side language
[21:05:18] <Spadeski> yeah im thinking ajax just not how i will logically save it to make it work
[21:05:57] <micro__> are you using a mysql database?
[21:06:07] <Spadeski> I am
[21:06:23] <micro__> then you will need php to speak with the mysql
[21:06:40] <Spadeski> ok lol go on
[21:08:25] <micro__> well im not sure what you're asking... you will need to learn how to sanitize, save and store data using mysql and php
[21:09:14] <Spadeski> ok what i want is after I make it drag and drop how will i make it so theycansave the order of the top " images" and have that show up every time
[21:10:24] <Spadeski> using php mysql
[21:10:30] <Spadeski> and ajax
[21:11:10] <micro__> you can do a bit of client side logic work using javascript
[21:11:27] <micro__> then send the "order" to php and then store in the mysql
[21:12:51] <Spadeski> ok easy enough how do I get the order my images are in
[21:25:01] <Spadeski> micro_ http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/arrange-table-rows/demo.html Like this but when I switch one it saves and shows a new numbered list
[21:27:49] <coldhead> poor pipe :(
[21:36:12] <dshap> hey all, was wondering if someone could help me understand why this doesn't work: $('body').append($('<a>').attr('href','http://www.google.com').val('go to google'));
[21:37:16] <snover> ?val @ dshap
[21:37:16] <bot-t> dshap, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[21:37:35] <vviljanen> dshap: because append returns the body element, not the a
[21:37:57] <dshap> im trying to create a new <a> and append it to the body
[21:38:07] <dshap> should that val() instead be html() ?
[21:38:22] <vviljanen> create it separetelly and assign it to some variable and then add that to the body
[21:38:47] <dshap> is that better practice for some reason?
[21:39:00] <vviljanen> well, it works..
[21:39:23] <dshap> per snover's hint, i got rid of the val() and i just changed it to html() and now that works
[21:39:27] <vviljanen> and yes, I guess you should use html instead of val
[21:39:38] <vviljanen> hmm, ok.
[21:39:45] <dshap> thank you
[21:39:46] <dshap> both
[21:40:00] <dshap> but vviljanen: any reason why i should assign that new element to a variable before appending?
[21:40:06] <dshap> if i have absolutely no intention of modifying it later
[21:40:14] <vviljanen> no, if it works that way
[21:40:22] <dshap> gotcha
[21:40:23] <dshap> tyvm
[21:40:43] <dshap> another quick question
[21:40:47] <vviljanen> i would have guessed that the append would return the bodu and the attr would have been applied to it
[21:40:59] <dshap> is .val('something') equivalent to .attr('value','something') ?
[21:41:36] <vviljanen> not sure, but I guess .val would be better choise
[21:41:42] <dshap> ah, but i didn't put the .attr after the .append()...i called .attr() from the argument that i passed into .append()
[21:41:48] <dshap> k
[21:42:04] <vviljanen> ah, thats true :D
[21:42:13] <vviljanen> my baf
[21:42:15] <vviljanen> bad
[21:42:41] <vviljanen> it is still too early in the morning to read properly
[21:42:43] <vviljanen> coffee->
[21:51:56] <jacof> jQuery('#cas_Holder').parent().parent().addClass('cas_container'); <- correct ?
[21:54:17] <rhizmoe> oh i should probably just pastie it
[21:58:12] <coldhead> jacof: that looks okay
[21:58:18] <coldhead> you might prefer to use ?closest
[21:58:19] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[21:58:29] <coldhead> it's less fragile
[21:58:57] <jacof> in what circumstance could .parent break
[21:59:22] <snover> in the circumstance that you add more parents.
[21:59:37] <coldhead> which is basically guaranteed to happen
[21:59:41] <coldhead> in 6 - 8 weeks
[22:00:30] <jacof> closest means the parent actually but its more restrictive on to "what" parent ?
[22:04:27] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[22:05:34] <coldhead> hey Loser
[22:05:45] <coldhead> Loser|Work*
[22:05:46] <snover> dont be mean coldhead
[22:05:48] <ProLoser|Work> i have a design pattern - esque question
[22:05:56] <coldhead> snover is good at those, ProLoser|Work
[22:06:07] <coldhead> this is a great time to ask :D
[22:06:15] <ProLoser|Work> Okay so in my js-fw i'm collecting data using a few ajax requestions
[22:06:16] <jacof> coldhead: using closest is referring to itself.
[22:06:17] <ProLoser|Work> *request
[22:06:22] <snover> coldhead stop being mean
[22:06:30] <snover> insulting people
[22:06:31] <snover> calling them names
[22:06:41] <jacof> jQuery('#cas_Holder').closest('div').closest('div').addClass('cas_container');
[22:06:58] <ProLoser|Work> however i'm finding the only way to leverage the newly retrieved data is by using callback functions, but it feels like my code is turning into this endless spiral of nested callbacks
[22:07:14] <ProLoser|Work> is there some way i can create wrapper methods that simply return the result of the ajax requests?
[22:07:21] <snover> jacof: congratulations on completely missing the point !
[22:07:28] <ProLoser|Work> or am i forever doomed to have hollaback-inception?
[22:07:31] <coldhead> jacof: closest() is generally an alternative to parent().parent().parent()
[22:07:35] <coldhead> you should only need one
[22:07:41] <coldhead> just .closest()
[22:07:52] <snover> ProLoser|Work: use promises and/or reduce your dependence on closures
[22:08:11] <ProLoser|Work> promises?
[22:08:12] <jacof> coldhead but, what if the two parents are <div> and i'm aiming for the second one ?
[22:08:16] <rhizmoe> so, this is kind of plug-in'y, but i'm curious if there's somethign obvious i'm missing in this technique: http://jsfiddle.net/t8Lc8/4/ // the explicit filespec works fine, the getJSON doesn't
[22:08:18] <ProLoser|Work> how wouldst i reduce my dependency?
[22:10:01] <rhizmoe> i have tried it with .ajax as well
[22:10:49] <coldhead> jacof: i would give the target div a class in the HTML and then do $(this).closest('.that-class')
[22:19:11] <loopboop> what's the proper way to check if there was no selector passed in? this.context === document?
[22:23:03] <ProLoser|Work> is it me or did jsfiddle JUST release a new feature?
[22:33:02] <loopboop> any ideas? i'm trying to call my plugin without a selector
[22:34:03] <ProLoser|Work> $.someplugin
[22:34:11] <coldhead> that doesn't make sense
[22:34:20] <coldhead> what is it going to operate on if there's no selector?
[22:34:36] <ProLoser|Work> coldhead: are you a core dev?
[22:35:05] <coldhead> god no
[22:35:12] <coldhead> it's my first day using #jQuery
[22:35:26] <ProLoser|Work> iinternet is not a good conduit of sarcasm
[22:35:51] <ProLoser|Work> what's wrong with utility plugins like ones that parse the url params, or track history
[22:36:12] <coldhead> i am not being sarcastic
[22:36:31] <coldhead> ProLoser|Work: those are usually access by $.util()
[22:36:37] <coldhead> not $().util()
[22:38:19] <ProLoser|Work> that's what i said
[22:38:21] <ProLoser|Work> $.whatever
[22:38:31] <coldhead> yes, you were quite correct
[22:38:40] <loopboop> any idea how i can get both with one plugin?
[22:39:00] <loopboop> someone suggested this.context === document but that doesn't seem to work
[22:39:03] <ProLoser|Work> yes, although your reasoning is a little confused
[22:39:10] <mblitz> Hi, I have a problem with UI .selectable. I am using it an a big grid and you can click&drag or use the cmd(ctrl)-key to klick on individual fields. Since i need a solid block of items I want either deactivate the option to click on individual fields or fit the select so everything until the clicked item is slelected. How can i deactivate the cmd-key + click option?
[22:39:50] <ProLoser|Work> read the api? if there is no option for contiguous then code your own
[22:39:53] <rhizmoe> aich
[22:39:57] <ProLoser|Work> or google jquery ui selectable contiguous
[22:40:07] <loopboop> looks like $().myPlugin gives undefined as the context type and $.myPlugin fails altogether using the suggested plugin model. any ideas?
[22:40:22] <ProLoser|Work> loopboop: read the plugin api
[22:40:31] <Eviltwin> Remember: http://s3.amazonaws.com/theoatmeal-img/comics/shopping_cart/4.jpg
[22:40:43] <loopboop> prolooser: i did, it doesn't mention anything about that
[22:41:07] <ProLoser|Work> then go look at the jquery source code
[22:41:26] <mblitz> @ProLoser: Have read the api, don't know how to add that, google is no answer at least not with my keywords. Thats why I ask here "
[22:41:42] <coldhead> loopboop: http://jsfiddle.net/4eUEm/
[22:41:51] <coldhead> i would use something really obvious like that
[22:42:01] <coldhead> then you don't have to use fancy tricks
[22:42:05] <coldhead> it's all explicit
[22:42:53] <loopboop> ah okay, makes sense
[22:42:53] <loopboop> thanks
[22:43:04] <coldhead> you're welcome, good luck loopboop

[23:26:35] <Spadeski> Hello everyone
[23:27:11] <KicStart1> hello
[23:27:22] <Aristata> I have an array of arrays, and I want to map each subset of arrays to something different, what is the cleanest non-hacky way to do this?
[23:28:08] <Spadeski> I kinda wanna do the same I have a draggable content area as a list and I want to get the order there in and send it to the database
[23:30:05] <KicStart1> Aristata: I'm partial to hashmaps
[23:30:48] <Spadeski> http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/arrange-table-rows/demo.html
[23:30:53] <Spadeski> That is the demo I am using
[23:32:52] <Spadeski> Anyone ?
[23:51:34] <red> I've a problem using Colorbox: I'm working inside an iframe that roughly takes 60% of screen estate, and inside that iframe there's my custom built image search which brings from our MaM thumb results via AJAX to the iframes bottom. I've enabled colorbox for the images but the modal opened by Colorbox is restricted by the dimensions of the smallish iframe.
[23:51:53] <red> Does anyone have any tips how I could make Colorbox ignore the iframe it is in and use the full viewport size?
[23:53:49] <red> Doesn't seem like I can even target the main iframe via jQuery :|
[23:53:58] <red> Trying to console.log it just get [] in console
[23:54:28] <KicStart1> red: try fixed: true
[23:55:17] <KicStart1> and then adjust width/height appropriately
[23:56:49] <red> I've tried
[23:57:00] <red> lemme show you how it goes with fixed true when I adjust, sec
[23:57:44] <ProLoser|Work> is there a better way than iterating through an array to add a value to each slot?
[23:58:32] <deteego> I have a question regarding extend, if the properties exist in the object being extended and the object you are extending it with, will it update
[23:58:34] <red> kicstart1: http://awesomescreenshot.com/0eekr1te6
[23:58:36] <hyfather> how to stop event propagation from the jQ-ui accordion#changestart in version 1.8.6
[23:58:53] <red> see, with fixed and adjusting "top" to get it start from the top of the viewport, it still just goes "under" the iframe
[23:59:02] <red> kinda like out of it's visible bounds
[23:59:18] <red> i've tried most of the Colorbox settings, but can't figure it out
