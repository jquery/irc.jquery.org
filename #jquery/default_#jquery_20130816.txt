[00:06:52] <grafi> unrelated question, macbook pro retina people present?
[00:12:27] <ravenzz> grafi why not?
[00:12:43] <grafi> why not?
[00:13:09] <ravenzz> ahah I don't know what was the context of that question
[00:13:50] <grafi> didnt even ask a question yet ^^
[00:14:08] <ravenzz> <grafi> unrelated question, macbook pro retina people present?
[00:14:29] <grafi> yeah well, not the real question anyways ^^
[00:14:52] <ravenzz> whatever
[00:15:51] <OnkelTem> jQuery UI 1.10.2 question. For some reason autocomplete widget is not created with error that it has no method "menu".
[00:16:21] <OnkelTem> What would add .menu method to widgets?
[00:16:47] <OnkelTem> May it be for some occation - jquery.ui.menu.js? :)
[00:22:10] <finfin82> doug65536: im back now and as i see you too :) you said you have a solution for my inline-style question?
[00:22:21] <doug65536> I think so
[00:23:20] <doug65536> finfin82: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Vrabd/17/
[00:23:43] <doug65536> finfin82:  I'm not sure if it always sets all those styles or the fiddle is using a reset css
[00:23:54] <finfin82> will have a look ... thx :)
[00:24:19] <doug65536> finfin82: ignore most of it except $('#styles... part at bottom
[00:24:31] <doug65536> finfin82: I based it on that fiddle because it uses styles a lot
[00:24:52] <finfin82> so you just wrote it? :)
[00:25:00] <doug65536> finfin82: yes
[00:27:05] <finfin82> very nice and seems to be perfect
[00:27:14] <OnkelTem> So why autocomplete widget needs '.menu' method and what do it mean? From where it comes?
[00:27:19] <uwjesq> How can I check if an element already has a click event assigned?
[00:28:46] <doug65536> finfin82: wait, bug
[00:32:06] <doug65536> finfin82: consider this way too http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Vrabd/21/
[00:32:09] <finfin82> doug65536: it doesnt seem to walk through all depths
[00:32:21] <finfin82> k, mom :)
[00:32:22] <doug65536> finfin82: yes I accidentally tried to use contents()
[00:33:24] <finfin82> thats awesome magic :)
[00:34:30] <doug65536> finfin82: http://caniuse.com/#feat=getcomputedstyle
[00:35:24] <finfin82> ahh good to know
[00:35:51] <finfin82> thanks a lot doug65536!
[00:35:56] <doug65536> finfin82: np
[00:36:13] <finfin82> nice pic btw :)
[00:36:28] <doug65536> finfin82: that one being first is no coincidence :D
[00:37:06] <leony> how to change only the text on mouse hover over anchor tag. The styles in css should also get applied
[00:37:09] <uwjesq> Already fixed. Thanks.
[00:37:39] <finfin82> haha i thought so
[00:47:33] <exploud> hello, how can we set different javascript based on screen width ?
[00:48:01] <bobdobbs> "set different javascript?"
[00:48:18] <exploud> ya like for desktop, this, tablets, that
[00:48:25] <exploud> like @ media screen in css
[00:48:35] <doug65536> exploud: you might want $(window).width()  .height()
[00:48:38] <exploud> .width i have to run on function()?
[00:48:52] <exploud> or window.load
[00:49:20] <doug65536> exploud: you probably want to catch window resize events too
[00:49:35] <exploud> yes
[00:50:01] <exploud> i know how to do that.. $(window).resize(function()
[00:50:48] <bobdobbs> exploud: you might have to google 'debounce' as well
[00:51:11] <doug65536> exploud: $(window.screen).width()  .height()  might be useful if you want to detect the monitor resolution. I've never used that though
[00:51:17] <bobdobbs> like, rezise triggers as the browser resized, if I remember correctly
[00:51:53] <bobdobbs> so you have to figure out how to get the width _after_ the resizing has stopped
[00:52:40] <fella5s> i noticed that i can do this: $('.class', leftFrame).on('click', function(){...};
[00:53:06] <fella5s> is it possible to make context of that "function" to leftFrame?
[00:53:56] <fella5s> so that for every selector would be within leftFrame, or should i just select everything with $('.smthng', leftFrame)?
[00:54:26] <Cork> fella5s: you could bind the click on leftFrame, and then check event.target for the element you want to click
[00:54:58] <Cork> and then you could do $(this).find()
[00:55:08] <Cork> fella5s: alternatively you can set a data for the event handler
[00:55:17] <Cork> and give it leftFrame as it's data
[00:55:27] <Cork> then do event.data.find()
[00:55:33] <doug65536> Cork: I like the data idea
[00:55:40] <fella5s> so it would be $(leftFrame).on('click', '.class', function(){..});
[00:55:48] <Cork> no
[00:55:52] <fella5s> ?
[00:55:56] <Cork> that would still have the context of .class
[00:56:10] <fella5s> oo
[00:56:12] <fella5s> i see
[00:56:14] <fella5s> ofc
[00:56:56] <Cork> $(leftFrame).on('click', '.class', leftFrame, function(event) { event.data.find()( })
[00:56:59] <Cork> * $(leftFrame).on('click', '.class', leftFrame, function(event) { event.data.find() })
[01:01:33] <exploud> hmm. i fired up this code, but it doesn't execute at all http://pastie.org/8241380
[01:02:00] <Cork> exploud: check the error console
[01:02:22] <exploud> nothing there...
[01:02:34] <Cork> do you have a link?
[01:02:44] <exploud> umm no its offline
[01:02:56] <exploud> ok i think i got it..
[01:03:10] <exploud> i put the adjust slider inside resize..
[01:05:03] <bobdobbs> hey, js is single-threaded right? Does that mean that if a function in a script has an infinite loop, then control never gets returned ? So you never get the the next function?
[01:05:42] <Cork> yes
[01:05:49] <Cork> and the page will hung
[01:05:55] <Cork> unless you use webworksers that is
[01:06:00] <bobdobbs> oh dang.
[01:06:47] <bobdobbs> So, I'm building this slideshow. I thought that I'd want an infinite loop for it. You know, like 'while true, keep moving these slides around"
[01:06:56] <bobdobbs> but now I'm not sure what to do
[01:07:11] <doug65536> bobdobbs: definitely not an infinite loop
[01:07:19] <Cork> ?g mdn requestAnimationFrame
[01:07:20] <b-ot> Cork: window.requestAnimationFrame - Web API reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame
[01:07:26] <Cork> bobdobbs: ^
[01:07:41] <fella5s> why i had to test that infine loop
[01:07:52] <fella5s> now my browser is stuck
[01:08:10] <Cork> bobdobbs: and then you can use an setInterval for fallbacks for old browsers
[01:08:16] <Cork> oppps
[01:08:19] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[01:08:19] <Cork> sorry setTimeout
[01:08:29] <Cork> but requestAnimationFrame is what you want
[01:08:30] <doug65536> fella5s: it should offer to break out of the script eventually
[01:08:38] <doug65536> fella5s: but I'm sure you were kidding
[01:09:09] <fella5s> well, that tab eventually closed, just took a while
[01:09:35] <Cork> ya infinite js loops isn't fun
[01:09:42] <bobdobbs> dang
[01:09:46] <bobdobbs> this is tricky
[01:10:20] <Cork> bobdobbs: yes doing it correctly is a bit tricky
[01:10:33] <scr3am> Cork: recursive?
[01:10:33] <Cork> and that is why so many slideshows are broken by design
[01:10:40] <Cork> scr3am: no just loops
[01:10:49] <bobdobbs> well, I'
[01:10:50] <scr3am> ahh ok...
[01:11:04] <bobdobbs> I've already settled on an animation library to use: greensock
[01:11:33] <bobdobbs> so they will probably be using window.requestAnimationFrame under the hood
[01:11:44] <Cork> bobdobbs: jquery actually used requestAnimationFrame, but there are too many broken slideshows out there
[01:11:55] <Cork> so they had to back out the optimization from jquery
[01:11:56] <bobdobbs> I guess that once I've set up the initial animation, I need to repeat it.
[01:12:16] <bobdobbs> Cork: intereisting
[01:12:25] <Cork> bobdobbs: you need to calculate the step size for each set of ms
[01:12:53] <Cork> bobdobbs: and then take the ms in the callback and calculate how far it has gotten since the last time you where called
[01:13:00] <scr3am> Cork: what slideshow exactly u are using?
[01:13:01] <Cork> and then from there take where it should now be
[01:13:11] <Cork> scr3am: none actually
[01:13:18] <scr3am> and planning?
[01:13:20] <bobdobbs> Cork: trying to visualize what you said
[01:13:23] <Cork> scr3am: but i haven't seen one library on the net that isn't broken
[01:13:34] <scr3am> good
[01:13:38] <Cork> scr3am: i usually write my animation my self
[01:13:45] <Cork> and nowdays i try to not do it in js
[01:13:50] <scr3am> Cork: yeah
[01:14:07] <Cork> and just have jumps if they don't support keyframes or transition
[01:14:27] <Cork> (the animation shouldn't be a must for the page to work after all)
[01:15:06] <bobdobbs> Cork: I'm afraid I'm a little lost. I'm not quiet sure what you mean. I know what a callback is. I'm not quiet sure what you mean by step size
[01:15:20] <Cork> bobdobbs: ex.
[01:15:34] <Cork> take that you should animate from 1 to 5000
[01:15:44] <Cork> the animation should take 500 ms
[01:16:02] <Cork> that means for every ms you should move 10 px
[01:16:21] <Cork> so you take the date from when your last animation was
[01:16:31] <Cork> and removes that from the current animation date
[01:16:37] <Cork> and that * 10
[01:16:42] <Cork> and you get your new animation position
[01:17:01] <Cork> that way
[01:17:08] <Cork> even if the computer gets a slowdown
[01:17:18] <fella5s> isn't that kind of overkill?
[01:17:23] <Cork> your animation will finish in the sad time of 500ms
[01:17:34] <Cork> fella5s: only way to make reliable animations
[01:17:47] <Cork> fella5s: it is what jquery animate use internally too
[01:18:03] <fella5s> so you just adjust your animations to "delta"?
[01:18:06] <Cork> except it converts the date object to how far it should go in the animation
[01:18:12] <Cork> fella5s: yes
[01:18:38] <Cork> that way if two independent animations is started at the exact same time, they will finish aprox at the same time
[01:18:48] <Cork> even if the computation would have caused them to shift
[01:19:37] <Cork> fella5s: for example the computer could go to sleep and wake up 2 days later
[01:19:53] <Cork> and by then the animation should have finished
[01:20:31] <Cork> (and that is one of the reasons why you should avoid timers if you don't have to use them)
[01:20:45] <Cork> as they will actually prevent the computer from going to sleep
[01:21:21] <bobdobbs> aw man
[01:21:27] <bobdobbs> this is interesting stuff
[01:24:57] <bobdobbs> I get it in concept, but I'm having a hard time visualizing it. Is there any skeleton code around for this?
[01:29:33] <scr3am> if in a different browser-tab they won't even be executed...
[01:29:45] <jned> I have .focus set on an input box.  When I click a drop down link it loses focus.  And when I click the drop down link again, to close it, I would like to have the input have focus again, how can I do this?
[01:29:45] <doug65536> does this seem like a good debounce implementation? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/pHKJU/
[01:31:46] <Cork> bobdobbs: there should be a few examples on mdn
[01:32:01] <Cork> bobdobbs: and if you google requestAnimationFrame examples you should find a few
[01:32:10] <bobdobbs> cool. thanks
[01:32:26] <scr3am> http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/
[01:32:27] <Cork> bobdobbs: also you could have a look in hack.mozilla.org
[01:33:29] <Cork> scr3am: about the other tab; ya why do animation work when noone sees it
[01:34:28] <scr3am> Cork:  they won't get started at all!
[01:34:45] <Cork> scr3am: they do
[01:34:58] <Cork> the callback won't be triggered until the tab goes back though
[01:35:22] <scr3am> Cork: yeah
[01:35:36] <Cork> (and like i said, that is the point)
[01:35:47] <scr3am> Cork: got ya
[01:47:27] <doug65536> can someone code review my resize debouncer?
[01:47:30] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/pHKJU/
[01:48:15] <doug65536> I am trying to get started making jquery plugins and figured this would be a simple start
[02:10:05] <leony> dogarrhea, hi
[02:11:07] <leony> dogarrhea, the solution you provided in css channel changes the text on mouse hover, but i have some css styles on hover. Those styles are not getting applied.
[02:14:36] <jned> how can you unselect a button?
[02:16:59] <ravenzz> define select
[02:17:20] <xec> jned: $("button").blur() ?
[02:17:34] <jned> xec thx
[02:17:40] <xec> that is, if you want to remove focus
[02:18:56] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[02:19:39] <jned> xec, yes, that is what I am trying to do.  It worked without the quotes, but console error, with quotes it doesn't work.  and this doesn' t work either for some reason
[02:19:53] <xec> jned: uh what?
[02:20:40] <xqo> $(this) is a select-menu, how do i get the value of the selected option?
[02:21:23] <jned> xec, $("button").blur() doesn't work, but $(button).blur() seems to work except there is console error
[02:21:38] <xec> "button" is a selector for <button>
[02:21:50] <xec> i imagine your selector would be different
[02:22:10] <xec> xqo: $(this).val()
[02:22:46] <xqo> xec but what is this stuff? option:selected
[02:22:51] <xqo> $( "#myselect option:selected" ).text();
[02:22:58] <jned> I have $('.dropdown').on('hidden.bs.dropdown', function(){ alert('test'); ...which works, but $("button").blur(); doesn't nor $("this").blur();
[02:23:19] <xec> xqo: text is different from value, if you want the  value, just grab it from the select
[02:24:13] <xec> xqo: if you want to do something else with the selected option, ":selected" is an option (no pun intended)
[02:25:04] <xec> jned: $("this") would select a <this> element, you probably want $(this)
[02:25:30] <xec> jned: and what are you *really* trying to do? show us some context please
[02:25:36] <jned> xec, oh, thx, I tried it, dunno whats happenning here
[02:26:52] <jned> I have an input box, and a drop down menu.  I have the focus set to the input box using .focus(), when I click the drop down menu, it drops down the menu, and when I click it again, it hides the drop down menu.  This hidden even can be captured as the script above, but I can't seem to set the focus back to the input box
[02:27:34] <jned> Maybe its better this way actually
[02:28:02] <jned> if user is navigating he should be required to click back into input box when he want to return to it
[02:28:20] <jned> but I have no idea why its not working
[02:29:13] <xec> jned: is this what you meant? http://jsfiddle.net/wn379/1/
[02:30:11] <jned> xec, yes, but its not working for me, maybe its my browser then, it works for you?
[02:30:50] <xec> the demo isn't working for you?
[02:31:01] <xec> what browser?
[02:31:38] <jned> nope, chrome and firefox
[02:31:53] <jned> chrome 28
[02:32:07] <jned> iceweasel 17
[02:32:59] <xec> i'm on chrome 28 too, works fine here :/
[02:35:07] <jned> xec, can you try it at www.jmmywebworks.com
[02:35:49] <jned> xec, click one of the drop downs and click again to hide it, and see if focus goes back to the input box
[02:43:07] <iaj_> Hey guys.
[02:43:30] <iaj_> Im confused, shall I use jQuery 1.9x or 1.10.2  … aint 1.9 the more recent one?
[02:44:18] <xec> 1.10 is more recent
[02:44:20] <Cork> iaj_: 10 comes after 9 last i checked
[02:44:21] <null__> 10 > 9
[02:44:26] <null__> but that's an easy mistake
[02:44:29] <iaj_> ohhh..
[02:44:31] <iaj_> omg...
[02:44:35] <iaj_> sorry guys
[02:44:38] <null__> np
[02:45:11] <sifu_> so i am getting an object is undefined error but just can't figure out why (link: http://www.m25audi.co.uk/flip.html)
[02:45:40] <mar77i> hello
[02:45:44] <sacho> sifu_, because d.mobile is undefined.
[02:46:06] <sacho> which you can clearly see, as you console.log() its value
[02:46:12] <sifu_> sacho but why…because a file is not included where it is defined...
[02:46:36] <sacho> I have no idea what d.mobile is.
[02:46:37] <sifu_> yes and the confusing part is i got another site using the same plugin which works fine
[02:46:39] <Cork> sifu_: load the un minified versions of the libs
[02:46:46] <sifu_> okey
[02:46:56] <Cork> then the variable names will make sense
[02:48:26] <sacho> d looks like jQuery.
[02:49:46] <mar77i> so I have this fullcalendar running here... access runs through a function, to which I pass strings or an object...
[02:50:29] <mar77i> https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar/blob/master/src/main.js << source.
[02:52:31] <xqo> can i fadeout multiple items?
[02:52:38] <xqo> $("div").fadeOut() ?
[02:52:47] <Cork> yes
[02:53:28] <xqo> Cork and that line will fadeout all divs?
[02:53:33] <Cork> yes
[02:54:34] <sifu_> cork…added the unmagnified version of the flip.mobile.js (jquery.min is still minified) link again: http://www.m25audi.co.uk/flip.html)
[02:54:36] <TiagoSilva> join #html5
[02:55:02] <sifu_> now the error is TypeError: $.mobile is undefined
[02:55:18] <Cork> sifu_: jquery.mobile.flip is still minified
[02:55:39] <Cork> and it is the one complaining
[02:55:50] <Cork> ah sorry
[02:55:55] <Cork> old cache
[02:56:09] <sifu_> ohh okey…thought i went mad there ;[
[02:56:25] <OnkelTem> How to check jQuery UI version so that it would work for the older jQuery UI?
[02:56:48] <Cork> sifu_: you need jquery.mobile.js
[02:57:05] <sifu_> dohh!! okey thank you
[02:57:10] <Cork> OnkelTem: $.ui.version
[02:57:23] <OnkelTem> Cork: thanks!
[02:59:25] <OnkelTem> Cork: isn't there a helper function for versions compare? I want to express something like: if ($.ui.version >= 1.10.x) { ... }
[02:59:29] <xqo> if multiple divs are hidden, except one. should i check each div and only fadeOut the visible one, or do fadeOut on all of them regardless=
[02:59:30] <xqo> ?
[02:59:56] <Cork> OnkelTem: $.ui.version.split('.')
[02:59:58] <OnkelTem> Cork: its because they changed some naming convetions which made some Drupal modules to break
[03:00:07] <OnkelTem> Cork: ah, I see :)
[03:00:29] <Cork> xqo: if they are hidden fadeOut won't do anything
[03:00:55] <xqo> Cork yeah, so should i just fadeOut all of them, both hidden and displayed
[03:01:09] <xqo> or should i check if a div is visible before i fadeout it
[03:01:16] <Cork> xqo: no you "shouldn't" you may though
[03:03:03] <xqo> how can i make this fading smoother? it looks a little choppy http://hastebin.com/coyupoxuya.coffee
[03:03:21] <sifu_> thanks Cork that was the issue
[03:16:10] <OnkelTem> ui.menu widget question: before 1.10.x there was deactivate() method. Now it is absent. What should be used instead?
[03:17:49] <Cork> OnkelTem: .blur() ?
[03:19:07] <xuma> hey guys, how can i use Addy Osmani's jquery plugin boilerplate without selector ? like "$.myplugin('Some Text');"
[03:19:08] <OnkelTem> Cork: maybe. Where can I download jQuery UI 1.8.2?
[03:19:18] <OnkelTem> http://jqueryui.com/download/all/ - can't find it here
[03:19:26] <Cork> code.jquery,com
[03:19:58] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.2/jquery-ui.js
[03:22:24] <OnkelTem> Cork: yes, looks like it can be replaced with just blur
[03:22:47] <OnkelTem> Found interesting info in the source: "jQuery UI Menu (not officially released)"
[03:23:03] <OnkelTem> so in 1.8.23 it was a subject to change
[03:43:57] <zth> i'm using collapsible divs for displaying content on a site, that gets collapsed/shown via buttons. can i somehow easily make every collapsible div autohide just before a new one is shown? currently, you have to hide the div manually. (i'm looking for the behavior of an accordion)
[03:44:10] <zth> but for various reasons, i can't use an accordion

[03:56:36] <LeonardChallis> Hi guys, is there a legacy download location for jQuery UI? I need one that will work with 1.4.2
[03:57:36] <knobo> I have trouble understanding this: $.when.apply(null, deferreds).done(callback);
[03:58:39] <knobo> it is from http://coenraets.org/directory/js/app.js
[03:58:43] <ekemsend> oh hai, so im trying to do a click event to load a php page through ajax, each click creates a call to the ajax page. Can anyone recommend an efficient method to prevent pages from queueing?
[03:59:00] <ekemsend> im sure there is a best practice solution out there, but i am having trouble finding it
[03:59:08] <knobo> A demo app on how to mix backbone.js and twitter-bootstrap
[03:59:51] <xqo> how can i make this smoothing look nicer? it looks kinda choppy http://hastebin.com/coyupoxuya.coffee
[04:00:10] <knobo> I understand that $.when is run after $.get is done. But the apply(....) I don't get.
[04:00:48] <knobo> Apply is used to make "this" set to the directory variable?
[04:01:36] <knobo> But what is $.when.apply?
[04:01:53] <ball999> how to implement jquery mobile and how to implement this jquery mobile plug in to my webpage please? http://www.awwwards.com/touchswipe-a-jquery-plugin-for-touch-and-gesture-based-interaction.html
[04:02:52] <knobo> Or is apply used here to bind "this" to "null"?
[04:04:09] <ball999> ah jquery seems to have nice swipe function I giess no need of plugins :)
[04:15:20] <knobo> is $.when.apply().then() and $.when.apply().done() the same?
[04:18:51] <ball999> jquery includes all functions from querymobile?
[04:20:22] <nickycakes> no, jquery mobile adds functions to jquery
[04:26:04] <knobo> I found it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10345124/whats-the-meaning-of-when-applynull-a-method-in-jquery
[04:37:31] <ball999> anyone with ipad or touch mobile can test my page in 10 sec? just to see if swipe works?
[05:00:36] <sacho> knobo, pre 1.8, mostly yes. past 1.8, no.
[05:02:00] <sacho> Ah, your question was more on the use of apply vs the use of .then vs .done. Note that there's a difference between them.
[05:16:37] <citizen-stig> Hello everyone! could you please help me. I'm trying to write amcharts chart to jquery selector, but get "TypeError: Cannot set property 'overflow' of undefined", short example is here http://jsfiddle.net/WRszF/
[05:21:20] <fuchstronaut> i dont see where you are changing the css properties, citizen-stig
[05:22:00] <fuchstronaut> also theres a .text('fuck you'), something I did too until I failed to comment that line... :-)
[05:22:15] <fuchstronaut> now all my "fuck you" strings are "test"
[05:39:30] <citizen-stig> fuchstronaut, sorry, there was a few that lines and don't delete them all
[05:39:38] <citizen-stig> i've update it http://jsfiddle.net/WRszF/1/
[05:40:18] <fuchstronaut> dont worry about me, i just wanted to share, that this can become embarrassing ;)
[05:40:19] <citizen-stig> I don't change CSS properties, but amcharts library can
[05:40:41] <fuchstronaut> So I guess you are using amcharts methods on an empty jquery object
[05:40:52] <fuchstronaut> i dont know amchart
[05:41:17] <fuchstronaut> you could check your objects using console.log() before using methods on them
[05:41:33] <citizen-stig> it's not empty, look at line 69
[05:41:40] <citizen-stig> i can write text inside it
[05:42:32] <fuchstronaut> what line is giving you the error?
[05:43:15] <citizen-stig> 68: chart.write(place)
[05:43:53] <fuchstronaut> what error message are we talking about? :)
[05:44:25] <citizen-stig> "TypeError: Cannot set property 'overflow' of undefined"
[05:47:57] <RRR2> undefined.overflow=0
[05:50:23] <fuchstronaut> hm, write() is an amchart method and throwing errors.. if your chart object exists I can't help you
[05:50:58] <citizen-stig> ok, thank you
[05:57:10] <okdamn> hi how do i specify when click on DOM <a> element to launch an event only if element is not inside a <div> element?
[05:58:07] <fuchstronaut> okdamn: .parent() and check, or maybe do some css selector magic
[05:59:50] <okdamn> fuchstronaut:  oh right thanks!
[06:12:32] <Industrial> doing a $.get('/api/v1/Pages').done(fn).fail(err); my err gets called with a Not Found error, but when I visit that URL myself I get a neat REST response. What gould be up?
[06:13:07] <Industrial> could, even
[06:14:12] <fuchstronaut> knowing the element i need is 5 elements from $(this), do i really have to go with next().next().next().next().next() ?
[06:16:13] <dabear> Industrial: no idea, throw up a demo
[06:16:28] <xec> Industrial: if you use the dev tools you can see more details of the http response
[06:16:55] <xec> Industrial: usually there's a message in the response somewhere with a hint
[06:17:10] <dabear> fuchstronaut: you can use .siblings().eq(4)
[06:17:20] <fuchstronaut> dabear: thanks
[06:17:30] <xec> that won't work
[06:17:45] <fuchstronaut> hm
[06:17:48] <xec> .nextAll().eq(4) should
[06:17:57] <fuchstronaut> thanks xec
[06:18:50] <xec> they would do the same, mind you, if 'this' was the first sibling
[06:19:09] <Industrial> xec: like I said, 404
[06:19:23] <xec> Industrial: is there a response body?
[06:20:04] <Industrial> oh yeah there is, my static serving stack and rest api are mixing up it seems, oops :D
[06:20:22] <xec> :)
[06:34:47] <fuchstronaut> can I rely on jquery cloning elements AND events?
[07:20:25] <spobat> hi
[07:20:30] <spobat> how can i make this shorter?
[07:20:36] <spobat> $('#channels-list').children().each(function(a,e) { console.log(getSimpleText($(e))); })
[07:21:23] <mrchris> Is it possible to send data to the clipboard from my browser?
[07:23:22] <spobat> mrchris: reliably only with a plugin iirc
[07:23:30] <spobat> e.g. a ting flash file or so
[07:24:04] <mrchris> spobat: I need to do it without flash
[07:24:15] <bil> Can I use $.extend to add to a prototype object?
[07:25:03] <steveccc> are there any good jquery video podcasts?
[07:25:19] <RRR2> make it a function
[07:26:46] <kborchers> spobat: you could try $('#channels-list > *').each(function(a,e) { console.log(getSimpleText($(e))); }) slightly shorter
[07:27:13] <spobat> hm
[07:27:24] <spobat> i think children() is faster :/
[07:28:22] <kborchers> spobat: unless you're traversing a LOT of children, the difference is negligible i think
[07:28:37] <kborchers> but it's not that much shorter either so i would just stick with .children
[07:31:34] <aftab> Hello, I have an iframe on a web page and when it loads the source link the source link is supposed to redirect to a new url, is it possible to get that new url using jquery please ?
[07:32:20] <jdv79> i have an ajax req with jsonp: 'foo', jsonpCallback: 'bar' but i'm getting an error about bar not existing
[07:32:43] <jdv79> as i read the jquery jsonp code it should have installed that func.  i don't get it.
[07:36:06] <slax0r> aftab, why not just load that source link with ajax, get the redirect url and place that url to the iframe?
[07:36:39] <jeremy-> Can anybody give me a hint how I can make my jquery.validate() validate all fields when I've set it up initially so it validates onfocusout: instead. http://pastebin.com/W5ffQgmk
[07:37:11] <jeremy-> I was trying to get fancy and add a nice twitter boostrap style validation onfocusout, which works fine, but not when i try and use form.validate() on submit it does nothing
[07:41:06] <jeremy-> actually I'm getting cannot ready property settings of undefined next to line "if ( validator.settings.rules ) when i try and attach a .validate() to the submitHandler which i expect would have been the right approach
[07:41:14] <jeremy-> yet all individual fields validate perfectly
[07:46:15] <ball999> how can I make jquery to handle drag effect?
[07:46:20] <ball999> like swipe on mobile but with mouse
[07:46:49] <mfilipe> I'm trying to find out what is happening with my code. When the page is loaded, the change event (line 244@application.js) is executed but I don't why it is happening because I didn't change the select. https://gist.github.com/mfilipe/6245102
[07:46:59] <mfilipe> someone knows how I could debug that?
[07:47:03] <ball999> how can i see if users drags on left or right with mouse?
[07:47:09] <ball999> like swipe with touchscreen ?
[07:47:34] <mfilipe> I wanna know how the event is being triggered
[07:49:20] <jeremy-> mfilipe; likely that it is being programatically changed on document ready/load
[07:49:26] <tbmiller> hey, I'm getting an issue whenre I'm trying to do an .insertBefore() for image elements but I'm getting all instances of images in the element. how do I just more one images for its corresponding wrapper? (if that makes sense
[07:50:21] <ball999> how can I see if dragable is draging to left or right side?
[07:50:38] <jeremy-> tbmiller: lots of ways, you could just go like closest(), or prev() and then find the previous element and the element afterwards instead of trying to wrap the images
[07:50:47] <jeremy-> elsewise you could add it before the first image and the last image
[07:51:02] <jeremy-> cant remember what they are but you would be choosing the nth (first last) of that element kind
[07:51:43] <jeremy-> wrap() is a good way to wrap an element rather than the way you did it, but i cant see how you can wrap all images inside it, maybe check the documentation on that too
[07:52:29] <tbmiller> thanks jeremy, I'll look into them!
[07:58:00] <BillCriswell> How would you name a variable that is just a length of time for something to complete? I feel like I'm over thinking this.

[07:58:20] <BillCriswell> Bah.
[07:58:32] <slax0r> potato?
[07:58:58] <BillCriswell> slax0r: That's pretty good.
[07:59:17] <ball999> can I make draggable to not drag?   I need just to record the mouse position while dragging, how to do this?

[08:15:20] <kippi> hey
[08:15:52] <aftab> Hello, I have an iframe on a web page and when it loads the source link the source link is supposed to redirect to a new url, is it possible to get that new url using jquery please ?
[08:15:57] <kippi> I have a jquery page, I am using .load to pull it in, but it's not loading the jquery from the page I am calling, anyideas?
[08:16:27] <jdv79> it was just multiple callback killing eachother - thanks
[08:36:24] <MrJK> Hi,
[08:37:01] <MrJK> I don't know if I'm on the good chan, but I gonna ask my question anyway :p
[08:37:23] <BillCriswell> kippi: You would need to run the code on the page you're loading it into. jQuery isn't aware of the events attached to element when it's doing that load.
[08:37:23] <MrJK> I would like to be able to execute SQL queries via a form
[08:37:35] <MrJK> This is not a good idea, due to security issue
[08:37:46] <BillCriswell> MrJK: Yes.
[08:37:49] <BillCriswell> Correct.
[08:38:28] <MrJK> So, I'm trying to implement a SQL top layer to do my queries (alittle bit like gmail with its from:%s, to:%s ...)
[08:39:04] <MrJK> But, that is quite complicated, because I created a perser which convert my syntax to SQL syntax
[08:39:32] <BillCriswell> MrJK: What language are you sending this request to?
[08:39:43] <MrJK> That work pretty fine, but It start to be a lot of code, hard to maintain, and there is still a lot of bugs (big bugs or security wholes)
[08:39:55] <BillCriswell> This, so far, is much more of a question for #languageyoureusing
[08:41:14] <MrJK> The path is: User type in the form: "artist=Nirvana", then jquery send the request trough JSON to api.php . In my api.php, there is myparser which gonna convert my pesudo language quety to proper SQL query(to make it simple)
[08:41:51] <MrJK> BillCriswell, so I'm looking for a high level query syntax
[08:42:19] <MrJK> I'm sure somebody already wrote something in this purpose, but I don't even know what to type on Google
[08:42:55] <rmurphey> MrJK: use a query string or post formdata as key/value pairs
[08:43:08] <rmurphey> and then validate them on the server side before you turn them into a sql query
[08:43:35] <BillCriswell> MrJK: Are you trying to get that data into fields like... <input name="query[artist]" value="Nirvana"> etc?
[08:43:59] <MrJK> BillCriswell, nop, all in only one text box
[08:44:06] <MrJK> An example og my high level language:
[08:44:36] <MrJK> artist=Nivana AND date>1970 OR album~Nervermind
[08:45:46] <kippi> BillCriswell: how do I get it to load the jquery? just a point in the right direction to the function, don't want anyone to do it for me
[08:45:47] <BillCriswell> MrJK: Your language should have a split where you can split on /(AND|OR|\,)/ then after on /(=|\>|\<|~)/ to get you something manageable.
[08:45:50] <MrJK> That works very well, but when I've single quotes in my query strings, everything messed up
[08:46:02] <MrJK> BillCriswell, I've made a little doc: http://pastebin.com/h7L1SGCa
[08:46:34] <EdwardIII> hey, is there a way i can say "get my closest sibling?"
[08:46:40] <MrJK> This is my high level language syntax
[08:46:44] <EdwardIII> closest seems to traverse depth-wise but not breadth-wise
[08:46:52] <MrJK> But, I'm looking for something already existing
[08:46:54] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: .nextAll('.foo') or .prevAll('.foo') should do the trick.
[08:47:15] <BillCriswell> I don't understand breadth. I should really read a dictionary.
[08:47:54] <MrJK> this doc is quite uncomplete, cause i didn't documented yet AND, OR, NOT and parenthesis
[08:48:16] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: thanks for that! i think it might sort of do the opposite of what i want though, just trying to grok it
[08:48:28] <MrJK> Anyidea, or maybe I should have a look on PHP chanel ?
[08:48:44] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: by depthwise i mean parent and child elements, by breadth-wise i meant elements at the same level in the dom
[08:48:46] <BillCriswell> MrJK: Thnk that's your best bet.
[08:48:54] <MrJK> BillCriswell, any chan to recommand me ?
[08:49:11] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: Ah ok. .find('.childs-name') or .closest('.parents-name')
[08:49:17] <BillCriswell> MrJK: ##php
[08:49:24] <BillCriswell> /j ##php
[08:49:26] <BillCriswell> and you're good!
[08:49:50] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: hrm .closest returns all elements though, i only want the one that really is closest. guess i could just use .closest(''][0] though?
[08:50:10] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: .closest() only returns the first closest.
[08:50:15] <BillCriswell> You might be thinking .parents()
[08:50:20] <MrJK> BillCriswell, thank you :)
[08:50:40] <BillCriswell> No problem! good luck!
[08:51:14] <okdamn> hi all
[08:51:22] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyyyyy
[08:51:29] <okdamn> how can i put a method in queue to launch the same method each 5 seconds for example?
[08:52:13] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: If you use .find() you'd probably need to use $el.find('.childs-name').eq(0);
[08:52:21] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: [0] would return the DOM element.
[08:53:32] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: i think .closest is probably right, i'm just being daft heh
[08:53:59] <BillCriswell> Haha, happens!
[08:56:22] <EdwardIII> hrm wait no .closest definitely seems to traverse up the tree like .parents? lemme mockup
[08:57:09] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[08:57:26] <duch_kazatel> "For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree."
[08:57:35] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: http://jsbin.com/ititij/1/edit
[08:59:18] <aravindsrivatsa> I have an ajax call that returns JSON from a php. I echo'd the JSON and tested it at JSONLint. It was a valid JSON. But jquery shows status - 200, statusText - OK, thrownerror - SyntaxError: unexpected end of input
[08:59:19] <aravindsrivatsa> http://jsfiddle.net/hb2DD/
[08:59:32] <aravindsrivatsa> I've declared my headers in php as json.
[09:00:00] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: i'm trying to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/kbPQx/
[09:00:26] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: so if you click 'king of the hill' it deselects 'southpark'
[09:00:50] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: Not sure why you need closest here?
[09:01:25] <duch_kazatel> EdwardIII why not use a standard form with radio buttons?
[09:01:32] <duch_kazatel> and then style to your heart's content?
[09:01:48] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: well i don't, just getting the first element works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/kbPQx/1/
[09:01:51] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: thanks for the pointers!
[09:02:01] <EdwardIII> duch_kazatel: this is just a mock-up, in production it's more complex
[09:02:20] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/kbPQx/2/ si that what you're doing for?
[09:02:44] <BillCriswell> Lucnh! brb
[09:19:18] <aldodelgado> I have a click event on an image that gets loaded via ajax. Since the image for the event gets loaded after it doesn't fire the event. However if I move the image to the page I'm loading it works. Any suggestion?
[09:21:35] <darkfrog> In most jQuery plugins you can call $('selector').plugin('option', key, value); to change a property on an existing component.  However, with Spectrum (http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/) that does not seem to work.  I don't support someone familiar with the plugin could tell me what I'm supposed to call?
[09:28:18] <Andrew_R> I have a json string, which I am adding to an object. I want to to stay a string (the object holds parameters to pass to the server), but it's evaluating.
[09:28:25] <Andrew_R> Any ideas on how to force it to stay a string?
[09:31:30] <nicky> ive got a super remedial question about linking to scripts after Ive uploaded my site to hosting.  I uploaded the site to sub.domain.com, what is the correct way to link to scripts that are in subfolders?  for example this format is not working: <script src="http://sub.domain.com/dist/jquery.superslides.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
[09:33:01] <alexr2> what error are you getting nicky?
[09:34:01] <alexr2> Andrew_R: try a JSON.stringify() on it and pass it to the server that way
[09:34:14] <alexr2> rather adding it to your json object that way
[09:35:31] <Andrew_R> darkfrog: I looked through the source code, there is a global array added called 'spectrums'
[09:35:50] <Andrew_R> inspect that global variable and I think you could set the options directly on that
[09:37:29] <Jo_Native-Soft> What is the best way (in a performance way) to parse autogenerated html form which contain multiples objects like strings, array, boolean values to a php script usin ajax request?
[09:38:41] <darkfrog> Andrew_R: thanks, I appreciate it. :)
[09:39:36] <Andrew_R> alexr2: hmm, it's still evaluating with JSON.stringify().
[09:40:14] <Andrew_R> I have a wrapper around $.post(), I'll debug into that, I think it might be converting it back to an object in there.
[09:40:57] <darkfrog> Andrew_R: I see it in spectrum.js but I'm unsure how to access it
[09:43:39] <Andrew_R> darkfrog: I'm looking at the demo, and I don't see the spectrums variable in the global space like I thought it would be...
[09:44:30] <darkfrog> Andrew_R: when it refers to it at initialization it refers to this: https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum/blob/master/spectrum.js#L39
[09:44:34] <Andrew_R> alexr2: yup, the object is being passed to my wrapper correctly as a JSON string, it must be converting it somewhere in the wrapper, thanks
[09:45:38] <Andrew_R> darkfrog: my bad, I didn't see the commas, those variables are local to the function
[09:46:33] <darkfrog> Andrew_R: I created a bug ticket, but you have any ideas for a work-around?
[09:46:50] <darkfrog> I suppose I could hack the JS file and expose that array
[09:47:36] <Andrew_R> darkfrog: https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum/blob/master/spectrum.js#L731
[09:47:47] <darkfrog> err, I suppose it would probably be easier to just re-initialize with all arguments if I need to modify it.
[09:47:54] <RRR2> I don't think you can hack a js file
[09:48:03] <Andrew_R> undocumented method?
[09:48:34] <darkfrog> Andrew_R: interesting...so would it be $('#colorpicker').spectrum.option('color', 'red');?
[09:50:29] <darkfrog> RRR2: of course you can
[09:51:09] <Andrew_R> $('#colorpicker').spectrum('option', 'color', 'red') -- maybe?
[09:51:47] <darkfrog> Andrew_R: it doesn't complain, but it also doesn't do anything
[09:53:00] <darkfrog> hmmm, it seems it only doesn't work on 'color'
[09:55:10] <Andrew_R> darkfrog: I wonder if there is another internal method you can find that sets the color?
[09:55:20] <darkfrog> Andrew_R: just found it: "set" :)
[09:55:26] <darkfrog> seems very inconsistent
[09:55:41] <Andrew_R> ah cool..
[09:56:26] <Andrew_R> yeah if it's undocumented, that means the author didn't really intend for you to be able to set the color/options later
[09:56:32] <Andrew_R> seems like an oversight to me
[09:59:47] <defaultro> does jsfiddle have console.log support?
[10:00:05] <darkfrog> Andrew_R: thanks for the help
[10:00:19] <darkfrog> defaultro: of course it does...it's standard JS
[10:01:06] <Andrew_R> np
[10:01:11] <defaultro> how do I display it?
[10:01:27] <vanev> defaultro: You open the javascript console or inspector in the browser.
[10:01:38] <darkfrog> defaultro: F12?
[10:01:42] <defaultro> no, not the browser part but within jsfiddle
[10:01:48] <defaultro> i know the browser console log
[10:02:02] <vanev> defaultro: Just try opening the console for the browser and see that it works.
[10:02:12] <vanev> defaultro: Because it will work.
[10:02:28] <defaultro> so looks like if we use console.log in jsfiddle, we still have to use firebug or chrome dev tools for the console
[10:02:38] <vanev> defaultro: Correct.
[10:02:42] <defaultro> got it
[10:11:36] <BillCriswell> It's not like jsbin that has that little pseudo console.
[10:14:56] <asdas23d> hi all
[10:19:30] <EdwardIII> hrm, if i'm using delegated events, how can i tell which element was clicked reliably?
[10:19:55] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: You'd want to looking at the event objects target.
[10:20:00] <segphault> hi anyone used Flot here ? Need a liitle bit of a help here. I am getting the error "$.plot is not a function"
[10:20:27] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: hrm i can only see delegateTarget
[10:20:27] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: so e.target is the DOM element that triggered the event.
[10:22:03] <segphault> code here -> http://bpaste.net/show/FAt1CK9sE5Na5pqxTuAY/
[10:23:08] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: Have some code to look at?
[10:23:45] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: you're right, i'm just being dumb again heh
[10:23:47] <BillCriswell> segphault: I'm assuming the flot plugin file is 404ing
[10:38:37] <rgr> hi foolks. I want to position an element absolute on a dialog e.g in its top left. I can do that with pos:absolute and jquery.append. Now its there how can I "lift" it out of that parent so that its not absorbing the parents opacity changes - some way to lift it out and attach it to the body without losing its position?
[10:39:16] <duch_kazatel> rgr - just override the css.
[10:39:22] <duch_kazatel> that's the "cascading" in CSS
[10:39:42] <rgr> I dont think you understood.
[10:40:13] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* the child element inherited the parent's opacity.
[10:40:21] <rgr> I want an element to be positioned absolute to its relative parent. Then lifted *ot* of that parent so even if I remove that parent its still there in the sme position.
[10:40:35] <duch_kazatel> that is a different question.
[10:41:22] <duch_kazatel> either way, you could position, get the offset via .offset(), then move it to the body and apply that offset.
[10:41:38] <rgr> ok thats it then thanks.
[10:51:06] <segphault> BillCriswell: nope. I checked that
[10:52:17] <BillCriswell> segphault: try getting rid of the language and type attribute.
[11:03:42] <orion> Hi. I want to link two widgets such that if one is disabled, the other is also disabled, and vice versa.
[11:03:46] <orion> What's the best way to do this?
[11:05:24] <Jo_Native-Soft> Hi guys, i have a question regarding jquery and ajax. What is the best way to part data from html5 form to php script using ajax and jquery? do i need to use json? I would like something more or less generical to send and receive data over jquery from my php controller.
[11:05:25] <bak2helll> hi everyone..
[11:05:40] <Jo_Native-Soft> to parse *
[11:06:31] <bak2helll> i've some code which i know will never work, and i was wondering if there was even a way to work around it. should i post the pastebin link here?
[11:06:32] <BillCriswell> Jo_Native-Soft: You might want to look into $('form').serializeArray() and $('form').serialize()
[11:07:13] <Jo_Native-Soft> BillCriswell: Thanks, i will check for thoses methods right now !
[11:07:48] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: You've confused me quite a bit. =)
[11:07:57] <BillCriswell> Jo_Native-Soft: Welcome.
[11:08:02] <bak2helll> i'm trying to make a image fadeshow, and loading images in a very simplistic manner but the "asynchronous" quality is giving me a hard time doing it.
[11:08:13] <nerdsex> is it possible to have any of the ajax function return the data it fetched?
[11:08:51] <BillCriswell> nerdsex: $.get('events.php', function(events){ /* events is what was outputted by events.php */ });
[11:08:52] <nerdsex> so like, var x = $.getJSON(url, function(j)}
[11:09:04] <BillCriswell> nerdsex: j is what the script returned.
[11:09:04] <nerdsex> so have x hold j
[11:09:07] <nerdsex> i know
[11:09:14] <nerdsex> but if i do that, x holds the ajax object
[11:09:27] <nerdsex> is it possible to have it hold j, without assigning it inside the function
[11:09:51] <bak2helll> can you look into it?
[11:09:56] <nerdsex> just so i dont have to declare a variable outside the ajax call
[11:10:01] <nerdsex> trying to keep things simple and short
[11:10:01] <BillCriswell> No. You would need to do $.getJSON( url, function(j){ doShitWith(j); });
[11:10:09] <nerdsex> alright then
[11:10:12] <nerdsex> thanks
[11:10:14] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[11:10:34] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: Yeah. Put the code somewhere and I'll try to understand what you mean haha.
[11:10:55] <bak2helll> jere's what i tried: http://pastebin.com/WN5Njzp5
[11:11:21] <bak2helll> but as you can see while will finish it work way before the actual looping is needed.
[11:11:47] <bak2helll> i tried incrementing i in a callback inside the fadeout function,
[11:11:55] <bak2helll> but that with no luck.
[11:12:25] <bak2helll> tried recursion, but again browser stopped the script saying too much recursion
[11:13:04] <bak2helll> i know it shouldn't be so difficult, but i can't seem to find a way to do this(it's already been 3 days i'm not it).
[11:14:13] <bak2helll> *not = on
[11:17:46] <bak2helll> so what options do i have?
[11:20:04] <Jo_Native-Soft> BillCriswell: Do you think it could be wisely to send JSON.stringify( My Serialized Array form) throught $.ajax data: ?
[11:20:47] <bak2helll> i know, i could make an array of all the image file paths, and use each function to iterate over each image, but that would be too troublesome, since i'm planning to add more images later.
[11:24:51] <nerdsex> http://dpaste.com/1345725/ anyone know why x is undefined outside the callback?
[11:24:58] <BillCriswell> Jo_Native-Soft: You can do: { data: $('form').serializeArray() }
[11:25:25] <BillCriswell> nerdsex: Because async.
[11:26:16] <bak2helll> hey BillCriswell, anything for me..?
[11:26:17] <Jo_Native-Soft> BillCriswell: it will work with big form and possibly unsanityzed data? If i am right serializeArray return a Params list, right?
[11:26:34] <nerdsex> I can use deferred objects to fix this, yes? BillCriswell
[11:28:56] <BillCriswell> Jo_Native-Soft: Yeah, [ { name: "name", value: "bill" }, ... ]
[11:29:23] <Jo_Native-Soft> BillCriswell: Ok, nice, i will try it, thanks !
[11:30:44] <BillCriswell> nerdsex: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide40 might help?
[11:32:09] <bak2helll> what about me?
[11:32:19] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: What is your goal? to load 5 images with that fading effect?
[11:32:44] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: Or are you trying to do liek a slideshow with a single element
[11:33:39] <bak2helll> yeah, kinda making a fadeshow,(a slide show with fade effect), but i may put more images in the folder and then i would like to change the value of only one variable inside the code (the number of images) so the loop count increases to the number of files..and script may work as it is.
[11:46:59] <mad_mode_on> what feedback mechanism is more pleasing for the user nowadays: a Javascript alert or a fade-in / fade-out div with the message ?
[11:47:56] <snover> no
[11:51:22] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: Sorry, got caught up with something.
[11:54:45] <bak2helll> ok, so did you see the code?
[11:54:50] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:55:11] <bak2helll> and is it possible to do what i seek?
[12:00:16] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ugujeb/1/edit is what I had in mind.
[12:03:16] <BillCriswell> I really think you should be using one of the countless slideshow plugins already out there though
[12:04:31] <bak2helll> hmm..i've already tried that, but it's a little different from what i needed. i may need to increase the number of images later, so for that i would need to update the images array, and it will only work 5 times, after that it will stop at the last image.
[12:05:17] <BillCriswell> You lost me.
[12:05:37] <bak2helll> i tried it in a different way, so it doesn't end (the i%5 thing). but that caused so many recursion that the browser hung..
[12:06:09] <bak2helll> actually you can say, i just want to make that countless slideshow plugin, or rather i want to understand how they work.
[12:06:23] <BillCriswell> I have a comment in there to make it loop forever.
[12:06:33] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ugujeb/2/edit here it is doing that
[12:07:40] <bak2helll> yeah, but then again, it'll make countless recursion since none of the function call is ever ended.(no return). so the browser won't be able to handle it, and will stop it ultimately.
[12:07:53] <bak2helll> without even loading one image too.
[12:08:06] <tash> i'm almost embarrased to ask this, but I can't seem to get a basic subtraction operator to work right. Was wondering if someone could point out the obvious: var test = "<?php echo $number_of_apples;?>-1"; Then I'm doing: $( '#number_of_apples' ).html( test ); but getting "87-1" for example in my span
[12:08:43] <bak2helll> you've put -1 inside ""
[12:08:51] <BillCriswell> tash: Do var test = <?php echo $number_of_apples;?> - 1;
[12:08:54] <tash> funny, I just saw that after I asked :)
[12:09:00] <tash> rubber ducking, sorry
[12:09:09] <bak2helll> hehe, happens..
[12:09:10] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: You've lost me.
[12:09:10] <tash> thanks!
[12:09:26] <doug65536> the naming convension for jquery plugin functions is camelBackCase?
[12:11:28] <bak2helll> i'm saying no function call(fade()) will ever be over since each consecutive call will make another call to fade() before it's completion. so no function call will ever complete filling the browser cache, and causing the browser to crash.
[12:11:49] <bak2helll> or in modern browsers, causing the browser to force stop the script.
[12:13:36] <BillCriswell> Are you suggesting that it'll keep redownloading theimages?
[12:15:44] <doug65536> In jsfiddle, is the most problematic place for the code is "No wrap - in <head>"? The DOM is definitely not ready (to ensure code is correct when included with a script)
[12:16:14] <doug65536> s/code is/code/
[12:17:19] <bak2helll> no, it'll just keep calling the function without ever doing the loading work.
[12:18:11] <bak2helll> you see, the function call will never complete. it'll keep running the script endlessly
[12:21:24] <rhalff> I'm confused, when I post json data, I get something like: Request Payload: heading=Heading&tagline=Tagline&button_title=Learn+more when I watch the request in the inspector, is that correct?
[12:21:35] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: What loading work?
[12:21:46] <BillCriswell> It's ok to run things endlessly.
[12:23:03] <doug65536> rhalff: what do you mean "you get". you mean if you inspect the request in the network tab of debugger?
[12:23:18] <doug65536> rhalff: yes, posts are url encoded
[12:23:43] <rhalff> doug65536, yeah, I was expecting some json to see in the debugger, hm ok, guess I never watch it that much, only when my code fails :-)
[12:23:50] <rhalff> thanks.
[12:24:00] <doug65536> rhalff: data on its way to the server does not look like json
[12:24:17] <rhalff> doug65536, yeah that's why
[12:24:55] <doug65536> rhalff: if your data is data: { my_json: some_actual_json_string } then it will look like my_json=<some json>
[12:26:21] <rhalff> doug65536, ah thanks man, I assumed when I pass an object to the data: parameter of $.ajax, it would just be converted to json, I've added JSON.stringify now and it work.
[12:30:14] <bak2helll> ok, lets take your script for example, when you run it you should see a number from 1 to 5 at each image, but you see only 5(in the last image)..the reason in, the loop finishes much faster and reaches to maximum value(5 in this case). actual changes are rendered when the script completes loading, so only 5 is shown, if there would have been real images, only fifth one would load.
[12:31:07] <bak2helll> if it were set to work in endless way, it would never have loaded anything, you can try that if you like.
[12:31:54] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: I'm seeing 1....2....3.....4.....5....1....2....3....4...5
[12:35:50] <bak2helll> what browser are you using?
[12:35:53] <BillCriswell> Chrome.
[12:36:45] <bak2helll> i'm on firefox, and it's only showing 5.
[12:39:53] <janthony> Is it possible with jQuery Mobile to do page transitions/load pages that are on separate pages? Doing it all on a single page with data-role="page" seems simple, but want to do the same experience for pages that are separate from each other. i.e. if you're on a contact page, for it to load in the about page when clicking on the about link  from the contact page
[12:40:29] <arschmitz> janthony: it is designed to have them all be seperate files
[12:41:03] <bak2helll> oh well, i guess the best way would be to download an open source image slideshow plugin and reverse engineer it.
[12:41:06] <arschmitz> the multi page layout is just one option its really made more for multiple separate files for each page
[12:41:20] <bak2helll> guess that's the only option i'm left with.
[12:41:34] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: What do you need to "reverse engineer" it for?
[12:41:45] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: http://quick.as/byxsad
[12:41:59] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: Worked in Firefox too.
[12:43:01] <bak2helll> wait, then why isn't it working on my box?
[12:43:46] <janthony> arschmitz: When they describe their multiple pages, they show it as being several pages within one file per http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/widgets/pages/ - do you have a link or know the method used for having them actually be separate files?
[12:43:49] <BillCriswell> bak2helll: Couldn't tell you.
[12:44:08] <arschmitz> janthony: that same page
[12:44:23] <arschmitz> there is single page and multi page templates there
[12:44:31] <bak2helll> so the problem is something entirely different. gonna check it..and get back to you later..
[12:44:44] <bak2helll> thanks for all your help.
[12:44:50] <bak2helll> see you later.
[12:45:04] <arschmitz> janthony: you make seperate pages just like you normally would using the single page template and link them just like you normally would
[12:45:10] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:45:27] <arschmitz> janthony: and the jquery mobile takes care of all the navigation and transitions
[12:46:56] <janthony> arschmitz: Ahh. Maybe I'm over thinking it do to the structure I'm using. Thanks for clarifying. I'll play with navigation some more, then look into doing form submission/validation w/o loading the next view. I'm doing all of my validation via an MVC and plan on appending errors etc. via AJAX.
[12:47:10] <arschmitz> janthony: actually the multi page template has a lot of limitations and draw back and i only recomend it if you have no other choice
[12:47:38] <ball999_> how to select body with jquery?
[12:47:42] <ball999_> body of the document
[12:47:49] <ball999_> $('body') ?
[12:47:52] <arschmitz> janthony: it actually does ajax form submission built in but will reload the page
[12:47:56] <arschmitz> ball999_: yes
[12:48:22] <janthony> arschmitz: Yeah. I'm basically only using jQuery Mobile for the transitions/navigation atm.
[12:48:46] <ball999_> this is not working why $('body').click(function() {
[12:48:46] <ball999_>        alert(3);
[12:48:46] <ball999_>     });
[12:48:50] <arschmitz> janthony: other then widgets that is pretty much the whole thing :)
[12:48:51] <janthony> This view will exist as a web view inside a real mobile app, so want to emulate the experience as much as possible.
[12:49:02] <janthony> i.e. no page refreshes. :)
[12:49:27] <arschmitz> janthony: yes thats generally the idea along with transitions
[12:50:16] <arschmitz> janthony: if your just starting now i highly recomend starting with 1.4-alpha-2 released yesterday
[12:50:39] <arschmitz> janthony: a lot changed for 1.4 so id hate to see you get half done then have to do a bunch of work upgrading
[12:50:50] <janthony> arschmitz: Ahh. Thanks for the heads up!
[12:51:32] <arschmitz> janthony: no problem lot of improvments in 1.4 too when it comes to performance
[12:51:41] <janthony> nice!
[13:11:04] <nerdsex> What's a convenient way to detect which option was selected in a dropdown?
[13:12:17] <EwokFartPorn> nerdsex: http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/ ?
[13:12:19] <tw2113> :selected
[13:12:25] <BillCriswell> nerdsex: Do you just want the value or the actual option element?
[13:12:38] <nerdsex> weird. i looked into the firebug dom, it doesnt get the selected property
[13:12:50] <nerdsex> i mean, doesn't set
[13:12:55] <nerdsex> thanks BillCriswell
[13:13:09] <BillCriswell> nerdsex: Welcome.
[13:13:27] <abailarri> Hello. I implemented the jquery plugin for hide/show a div, but when I load the web, the div starts displaying. There is a way for start hidden?
[13:13:41] <tw2113> how's the new job trepmal
[13:13:49] <nerdsex> abailarri: give it a style="display:none"
[13:14:32] <abailarri> nerdsex: to the div?
[13:14:46] <nerdsex> abailarri: yes
[13:18:57] <abailarri> nerdsex: yeah! Thank you!
[13:19:18] <spobat> i try to change the document title
[13:19:18] <spobat> but it seems chrome has a bug there
[13:19:19] <spobat> it only does NOT work on chrome for windows.
[13:19:20] <spobat> it works on all other browsers + chrome for mac
[13:19:22] <spobat> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6559846/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-16%20at%209.50.58%20PM.png
[13:19:29] <spobat> the variable is updated, but not the actual title
[13:19:41] <spobat> test it live on metahill.com + sign in as guest
[13:19:53] <spobat> the (1) will appear if someone writes something and the metahill tab is not active
[13:20:00] <spobat> just ask someone in there to write anything and then switch the tab :)
[13:25:01] <Logikos> why is this not doing what i expect: $('<div id="dmpage"><a href="#">CLICK ME!</a></div>').find('#dmpage').html();
[13:25:23] <Logikos> expected it to return <a href="#">CLICK ME!</a>
[13:25:46] <Logikos> obviously i'm not doing it right, so my question really is, how do i go about getting the result i want
[13:26:00] <doug65536> what did it return?
[13:26:04] <Logikos> undefined
[13:26:16] <tw2113> that's a lot of markup in your selector
[13:26:30] <Logikos> yes it is, but thats not the point
[13:26:51] <Logikos> i'm useing ajax for a few things and one of those things returns markup which i want to navigate
[13:27:08] <Logikos> this is a simplified test case that expresses my problem
[13:28:33] <tw2113> well, you're using a selector to try and fine itself
[13:29:36] <tw2113> and i think with the selector, it runs the find on just children
[13:29:42] <tw2113> but i'm more than happy to be wrong here :D
[13:30:32] <Logikos> supose i had $.post(url, json).done(function(data){ $('#someid').html($(data).find('#dmpage').html()); });
[13:30:34] <Logikos> does that help
[13:30:54] <Logikos> basicly i'm trying to take some of the html returned via ajax and place it into the current dom
[13:31:28] <Logikos> i started my question with $('some html here').find... just to represent the problem
[13:32:04] <Logikos> what is the correct way to convert a string to dom object without placeing it into the document
[13:32:14] <Logikos> so that I can use jquery to grab part of it
[13:32:25] <tw2113> i'd have to tinker with that last suggestion to know if it'd work or not :D
[13:32:33] <tw2113> i'm still not *great* with jquery
[13:34:01] <Logikos> thats strange
[13:34:14] <Logikos> beings u said it only finds children i wraped the string in an extra div and it works
[13:34:18] <Logikos> *shrugs*
[13:34:29] <Logikos> i assume then there is a better function to use than find() but whatever
[13:34:31] <Logikos> i can wrap it
[13:34:34] <tw2113> yeah, from what i've done with this type of thing + ajax
[13:34:48] <tw2113> you use a wrapping div or so around where the ajax is coming in
[13:35:03] <tw2113> for the actual selector, then the find will go through all the new content pulled in
[13:35:14] <Logikos> ty

[13:45:59] <LoneSoldier728> ya understood am I passing it as req.body.EmailRe tho
[13:46:49] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying to figure out how to call it then because if I call req.body.EmailRe is shows up as undefined
[13:48:27] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: you understand that js creates that object literal, passes it to $.ajax, then forgets all about it, right?
[13:48:43] <doug65536> in that scope anyway
[13:48:55] <doug65536> $.ajax might hold it alive, but your code loses access to it
[13:48:56] <LoneSoldier728> oh, then how do I pass the email connected with the removeclass
[13:49:34] <tp43_> javascript function pass variable by value, not by reference correct?
[13:49:54] <doug65536> tp43_: objects by reference, strings and numbers by value
[13:50:36] <tp43_> doug65536, thx
[13:50:36] <LoneSoldier728> you know how I can call the email associated with the remove because it does show up on the clientside html as the value of data-email
[13:50:51] <LoneSoldier728> data-user*
[13:51:16] <doug65536> {EmailRe: $('.removeEmail').data('email')});    should be   {EmailRe: $(this).data('email')});
[13:51:20] <tp43_> doug65536, so if you change a value of a string, how do you get the new string in the calling function, hold I am gonna post my code in a sec
[13:51:43] <doug65536> tp43_: return it is the simple way
[13:51:55] <doug65536> return the "modified" string
[13:52:16] <tp43_> doug65536, thats what I thought, but I don't really understand how that works either
[13:52:51] <doug65536> tp43_: functions can return values.
[13:53:01] <EdwardIII> but they can't return cake
[13:53:22] <LoneSoldier728> great so this makes it available to all
[13:53:23] <doug65536> js> function add(a,b) { return a+b; }    add(2,4);
[13:53:23] <LoneSoldier728> thanks!
[13:53:30] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[13:53:36] <doug65536> js> function add(a,b) { return a+b; }    print(add(2,4));
[13:53:43] <b-ot> doug65536: 6
[13:54:09] <tp43_> doublerebel, so you would do result = add(2,4); and then you have you answer in result
[13:54:57] <tp43_> Thing is I am using callbacks to ensure one block of code happens before another
[13:55:24] <tp43_> so a line of code that uses result would happen first and that have a null in result
[13:56:49] <tp43_> Check it out, does this work? http://jsfiddle.net/QB8B2/
[13:58:25] <tp43_> http://jsfiddle.net/QB8B2/1/
[14:01:07] <Rarrikins> How do I convert jQuery("<option/>") to HTML?
[14:04:34] <sunbeam> is it okay to use an empty row in bootstrap?
[14:04:35] <sunbeam> to make some space
[14:04:50] <Zzaichik> ^gross
[14:04:56] <Zzaichik> no.
[14:05:00] <wppatrickk> trying to get this to work http://jsfiddle.net/Y3FBt/ wants footer to extend to full height of window
[14:07:48] <alexr2> wppatrickk: http://jsfiddle.net/Y3FBt/1/
[14:08:29] <wppatrickk> hmm but i don't want full same height as window height i want the different to be the height...
[14:08:39] <wppatrickk> difference*
[14:10:08] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net/Y3FBt/2/
[14:11:47] <wppatrickk> hmm but why isnt document height working?
[14:11:58] <Zzaichik> document isn't an element
[14:13:02] <wppatrickk> hmm ok
[14:13:13] <wppatrickk> html height will work?
[14:13:26] <Zzaichik> yes. or 'body'
[14:14:06] <wppatrickk> ok thanks!
[14:14:18] <wppatrickk> yes it worked.. http://jsfiddle.net/Y3FBt/3/
[14:28:36] <hyperking> Hello Everyone, I would like assistance on updating a class name after an ajax load using this plugin https://github.com/browserstate/ajaxify/blob/master/ajaxify-html5.js
[14:29:59] <hyperking> Essentiallly, how would I change the body class attribute to the new page name?
[14:32:45] <hyperking> Im working on the jsbin now
[14:46:57] <Nytician> Hi I have a quick question, how does everyone here deal with the 5mb storage limit on most browsers? I'm trying to create a game but no way is that going to be enough in the long run.. any way to get round this?
[14:49:39] <duch_kazatel> Nytician you mean in localstorage?
[14:50:44] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, yup, I know I can make my game run with less storage but if I want to continually develop and add features eventually that limit will become restrictive
[14:52:47] <duch_kazatel> Nytician there's not really anything you can do about it.  you might need to reconsider what you're doing
[14:53:03] <duch_kazatel> why store so much on the client-side anyway?
[14:53:22] <duch_kazatel> well, store so much in localstorage, at least.
[14:53:24] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, its a client side game ;) the website will store the download online, is the idea.
[14:53:45] <Nytician> I wouldn't use localstorage if there was another option but I want it to be stored locally really
[14:53:55] <duch_kazatel> Nytician you don't really have the choice ;)
[14:53:56] <Nytician> im thining of using tidesdk which is a desktop framework for javascript
[14:53:58] <duch_kazatel> people will have to download.
[14:54:10] <Nytician> duch_kazatel,  huh?
[14:54:11] <duch_kazatel> you can't change the limitations of locatlstorage.
[14:54:17] <duch_kazatel> *localstorage
[14:54:27] <Nytician> I didn't think so, thats why this desktop thing should be good.
[14:55:22] <duch_kazatel> then why the original question?  sanity check?
[14:56:34] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, no lol to see if there was any other options, I've read about 'indexedDB' and 'web sql' etc does that stuff still get limited by 5mb?
[14:56:43] <gandu> hi i just made this function, but the resize code isn't working
[14:56:43] <gandu> http://pastie.org/8243484
[14:57:36] <duch_kazatel> WebSQL isn't being developed any more - the w3c started and then stopped.
[14:58:12] <duch_kazatel> indexDB isn't fully support at the moment.
[14:58:23] <Nytician> I think I've picked the wrong language lol
[14:58:27] <Nytician> no way to store data
[14:58:42] <duch_kazatel> err, i think you're looking at it wrong.
[14:58:46] <duch_kazatel> you said you're using a special framework?
[14:59:14] <Nytician> im not using it yet im looking at it as an option
[14:59:14] <spobat> any idea how i could make this "loop" more elegant? http://ideone.com/L4ROsD
[14:59:40] <duch_kazatel> Nytician - you're convoluting "javascript" and "browser api"
[14:59:47] <duch_kazatel> localstorage is not apart of javascript.
[15:00:20] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, I do understand that but I don't know how else to store data, without hosting a website and using SQL databases etc
[15:00:34] <duch_kazatel> err, you distrubute the database with the app....
[15:00:51] <duch_kazatel> like anybody else would.
[15:01:17] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14757905/tidesdk-database
[15:02:20] <duch_kazatel> but why TideSDK for a game?
[15:03:04] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, just cause I couldn't work out how to do it without localstorage and tidesdk was offline so I supposed it wouldn't put a limit on storage.. but you say I can distrubute the database with the app...
[15:03:36] <duch_kazatel> Nytician that's what other games do...
[15:03:40] <Nytician> I must sleep now unfortunately but I didn't even think of that as an option.. any pointers as to what db were talking about and would the app still work properly offline?
[15:03:50] <duch_kazatel> read their docs.
[15:04:02] <duch_kazatel> but depending on the game i highly suggest not using that kind of framework.
[15:04:07] <duch_kazatel> that might be a big mistake.
[15:05:07] <LoneSoldier728> ok so I am usng a jquery .replacewith()
[15:05:17] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, Im not intending too now that I know I can package the database.. what database do you suggest using? mysql?
[15:05:19] <LoneSoldier728> to replace a div with an input
[15:05:41] <LoneSoldier728> how do i allow it to send me the old value and the new one at the same time?
[15:05:46] <Cheekio> how do I select an <option> with jquery?
[15:05:50] <duch_kazatel> Nytician it looks like it uses sqlite by default?  no idea.  not about to read their docs.
[15:06:56] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, I don't want to use it ... what I mean is what database does 'everybody else' use when they distribute... I assume you mean something like mysql that auto sets up when the app is installed and I read/write data to there rather than localstorage?
[15:07:18] <gandu> http://pastie.org/8243484 when i resize the window, nothing happens
[15:08:42] <duch_kazatel> Nytician now you're really convoluting it.  localstorage is apart of the browser - stop thinking about it in those terms, but here's some info for you: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/698516/how-do-video-games-efficiently-store-retrieve-large-amounts-of-data
[15:09:37] <duch_kazatel> Nytician are you new to programming?
[15:10:13] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, relatively yup, and as for storing data in small amounts I know how to do that but I still don't like to be limited to 5mb..
[15:10:43] <duch_kazatel> Nytician that's in web browsers.
[15:10:56] <duch_kazatel> localstorage is apart of web browsers.
[15:10:58] <gandu> ??
[15:11:22] <duch_kazatel> i'm either not understanding what you're getting at, or you're convoluting something.
[15:11:58] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, I am creating a js game to run in the browser offline, I need to store data somehow. end of. the localstorage browser based or not is the only I currently know how to do that.
[15:12:35] <duch_kazatel> you cannot run it in browser without either sticking to that limit or using some kind of custom setup.
[15:12:40] <duch_kazatel> or having them download.
[15:13:10] <duch_kazatel> your framework will probably have a way to store data alternatively outside of localstorage.
[15:13:20] <duch_kazatel> i do not know what that would be since i'm not about to read their docs.
[15:13:38] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, I'm having them download.. the only thing the website will host is the zipped file containing the files needed to run the game
[15:13:57] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, I'm not using tidesdk either I said that was something I looked at.
[15:14:05] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[15:14:09] <duch_kazatel> you cannot do what you want in browser.
[15:14:12] <duch_kazatel> period.
[15:15:07] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, okay so that was my question... so I'd have to run javascript elsewhere? I can't have a local javascript app use local data (from a database) correct?
[15:15:15] <duch_kazatel> ...
[15:15:23] <duch_kazatel> you can't "run javascript elswhere"
[15:15:26] <duch_kazatel> that's not how this works.
[15:15:45] <duch_kazatel> if you HAVE to use JS/HTML/CSS to do this, use that framework.  it will give you a way to do what you want.
[15:16:08] <duch_kazatel> that framework distrubutes to run outdide of the browser it looks like.
[15:16:08] <Nytician> duch_kazatel, I don't have to but I've coded half a game in that language I'd rather not start from scratch
[15:16:57] <duch_kazatel> you're arguing with me over something you cannot change.  you either play by the limits in browser, or use that framework.  if you use that framework, it will have a way to handle some kind of data storage.
[15:17:01] <duch_kazatel> that you can distribute with the game.
[15:17:06] <duch_kazatel> that will have nothing to do with localstorage.
[15:17:37] <duch_kazatel> if that framework does not offer that, then you're SOL.
[15:17:58] <Nytician> im not arguing I'm asking what I can do as I am ignorant to the limitations of javascript storage.. but thanks I understand now I'll work it out
[15:18:09] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[15:18:16] <Nytician> lol night
[15:18:19] <duch_kazatel> localstorage and javascript storage are totally different things.
[15:18:30] <duch_kazatel> jesus christ atwood's law at work.
[15:47:52] <ball999_> can I do this? $("rr").click(function(event){alert(event)})??
[15:48:45] <guideX> how do I sort into arrays based on data-item= attribute? for instance, say data-item=2 on several  items, and data-item=55 on others, how do I create arrays based on these (also I don't know what the data-item will be in advance)
[15:50:11] <Es0teric> has anyone here used ElasticImageSlideshow?
[15:54:42] <Rarrikins> How do I get errors to show up in the console if I call a method that doesn't exist?
[15:55:00] <doug65536> Rarrikins: that happens by itself
[15:55:09] <doug65536> guideX: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/
[15:55:31] <guideX> thanks checking it out
[15:55:54] <grafi> anyone able to access youtube oO
[15:56:02] <guideX> cool thanks a lot :)
[15:56:12] <doug65536> guideX: np
[15:56:48] <Rarrikins> doug65536: It's not for me. I do console.log('test'); jQuery('<option/>').zomg(); console.log('test'); and the first 'test' shows up, but then nothing.
[15:57:38] <doug65536> foo.zomg()
[15:57:38] <doug65536> ReferenceError: foo is not defined
[15:58:15] <doug65536> Number.zomg()
[15:58:15] <doug65536> TypeError: Object function Number() { [native code] } has no method 'zomg'
[15:58:41] <doug65536> that's chrome console btw
[15:59:10] <Rarrikins> Yeah, it works fine in the console.
[15:59:33] <doug65536> oh in running code?
[15:59:36] <Rarrikins> Yeah.
[15:59:39] <doug65536> it crashes on exception
[15:59:43] <Rarrikins> In an AJAX callback.
[15:59:51] <doug65536> browser abandons the script
[16:00:14] <Rarrikins> Is there a way to get it to tell when that happens?
[16:00:26] <doug65536> chrome debugger?
[16:00:32] <Rarrikins> Yes.
[16:00:41] <doug65536> click the little stop sign at the bottom in sources tab
[16:01:27] <doug65536> it will break into debugger on exception
[16:01:39] <doug65536> expect a few exceptions in jquery - it is detecting broken browsers and stuff
[16:01:55] <doug65536> at startup I mean
[16:02:54] <ball999_> $("swipeParent").on('click', function(e){alert(e.clientX); }); why this is not working?
[16:03:07] <doug65536> Rarrikins:  blue stop sign means, stop on uncaught exception, red stop sign means stop at every exception
[16:03:16] <doug65536> Rarrikins: you probably want blue
[16:04:07] <doug65536> ball999_: missing . in selector
[16:04:12] <doug65536> .swipeParent ?
[16:04:17] <doug65536> or #swipeParent?
[16:04:52] <doug65536> ball999_: there is no swipeParent html tag
[16:05:39] <ball999_> http://jsfiddle.net/78SLn/1/
[16:05:47] <ball999_> with it is not working again
[16:05:59] <doug65536> in that fiddle, code should say #ss
[16:06:29] <ball999_> sorry and thanks

[16:08:05] <PhlowHome> What's a good jquery / bootstrap color picker?
[16:40:01] <guideX> any idea why sortable is not defined? var order = $j(this).sortable('toArray', {attribute: 'data-item'});
[16:45:22] <xqo> guideX well there is a j inbetween $ and (
[16:45:33] <xqo> ill see myself out.....
[16:47:04] <tw2113> they could have assigned jQuery to $j
[16:47:28] <tw2113> oops, he left
[16:48:33] <doug65536> guideX: you sure you don't mean to type sorttable
[16:49:29] <PhlowHome> man, jsfiddle really doesn't like working for me
[16:50:02] <doug65536> PhlowHome: I haven't seen anything wrong yet in jsfiddle. can you show what you have?
[16:50:27] <PhlowHome> nothing of mine, just when I try to see other people's jsfiddle's, they don't work
[16:50:35] <doug65536> PhlowHome: every problem I've had has been my fault
[16:50:54] <PhlowHome> maybe it's noscript or something

[17:09:23] <doug65536> Rarrikins: sorry, what I said earlier was backwards. blue means stop on uncaught exception, red means stop at every exception. red is most useful
[17:14:45] <tomivs> I want to write: <a>text</a> with JQuery

[17:15:26] <tomivs> doublerebel, :D thx
[17:15:33] <doug65536> tomivs: then put it into the document somewhere with .append or something similar
[17:16:26] <doug65536> tomivs: example to put inside and at end of something with id xyz: $('#xyz').append($('<a>').text('text'));
[17:16:38] <tomivs> doug65536, .timotocuica
[17:16:58] <doug65536> tomivs: a tags need href
[17:17:15] <doug65536> tomivs: example to put inside and at end of something with id xyz: $('#xyz').append($('<a>').attr('href','something.html').text('text'));
[17:17:24] <tomivs> doug65536, href already exist
[17:17:41] <doug65536> tomivs: no it doesn't you created the 'a' tag out of thin air
[17:18:47] <tomivs> doug65536, <a href="page.html"></a> result = <a href="page.html">text</a>
[17:19:40] <DHowett> tomivs: you indicated that you wanted to create a <a> and put 'text' in it, so $('<a>') creates a new <a> that does not have an href.
[17:20:30] <tomivs> DHowett, I need add text
[17:22:14] <tomivs> Thank's :D

[18:29:04] <hyperking> doug65536: the slug of the page in the url or title tag
[18:29:40] <doug65536> hyperking: get the page title and put it where?
[18:30:40] <hyperking> doug65536: page title should be inserted into the body tag as the class name. i.e body class="page-name"
[18:31:31] <doug65536> hyperking:  $('body').addClass($('head title').text()) should work
[18:32:03] <doug65536> hyperking: but that doesn't make a lot of sense
[18:32:15] <ivanov_jaroslaw> doug65536: sorry. i add third slide and it just stop working and laging) so, i go to repair))
[18:33:07] <doug65536> ivanov_jaroslaw: I can't really see enough of the code to understand what is going on
[18:33:23] <doug65536> why does it appear to be duplicated on the real site?
[18:33:39] <hyperking> doug65536: sorry doug65536 Im using a ajax page loader that only updates the title tag with the correct page information, however, I need it to also update the body class attribute with the page name
[18:34:28] <doug65536> hyperking: again, doesn't make sense. if you put "ABC Corporation" as a class, it will add two classes: ABC, and, Corporation
[18:34:38] <Roots47> Hey all, when you're using $(this) often, and store it as a variable, what do you normally name it?
[18:35:24] <doug65536> hyperking: you must be miscommunicating what you mean by "page name"
[18:35:37] <doug65536> it can't be the title, that would be nonsense to put in body class attribute
[18:35:56] <hyperking> doug65536: right not the title!
[18:36:34] <hyperking> doug65536: its the page slug. page slug = about-us
[18:36:52] <doug65536> hyperking: do you have the class name you want to add to body? do it like this: $('body').addClass(whatever);
[18:37:05] <doug65536> "whatever" is a string you want to add
[18:37:10] <doug65536> the class name to add
[18:37:26] <hyperking> doug65536: Im aware of this approach but its too hardcoded
[18:37:48] <doug65536> hyperking: you aren't giving me enough information to answer
[18:37:57] <hyperking> doug65536: here is a fiddle http://jsbin.com/InAFibu/1/edit
[18:38:05] <tomivs> Hi
[18:38:06] <doug65536> it would be like me asking you how to take a part off my engine, without saying what car I have
[18:38:09] <tomivs> Help
[18:38:11] <tomivs> How can you change the URL without reloading the page?
[18:38:58] <doug65536> tomivs: you don't. what do you mean by "change the url"
[18:39:34] <doug65536> you mean change http://www.my-malicious-phishing-site.com/ and replace it with http://friendly-bank.com/
[18:39:37] <waysc> tomivs: look into history pushstate
[18:39:55] <waysc> unless you mean cross-domain url changes, which is impossible
[18:40:39] <hyperking> doug65536: look at line 13..this will gve us the page slug, but when you click another link, the ajax does not update the page tag
[18:41:16] <tomivs> http://site.com/ On click change URI: http://site.com/#section
[18:41:22] <doug65536> hyperking: add currLoc as a class on body?
[18:41:43] <doug65536> hyperking: I already told you
[18:41:52] <doug65536> hyperking: $('body').addClass(currLoc);
[18:42:13] <hyperking> doug65536: i have. look at line 163
[18:43:16] <doug65536> hyperking: class isn't a dumping ground for storing stuff... why is it putting things like 'loading' in there? is there a css loading class?
[18:44:04] <doug65536> there are no line numbers, and I really don't feel like pressing cursor down 162 times to find that line
[18:44:24] <doug65536> hyperking: what's the question
[18:44:58] <tw2113> [20:44:49.417] TypeError: document.getElementsByTagName(...)[0] is undefined @ http://run.jsbin.com/runner:23
[18:45:38] <hyperking> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/SUmsG/
[18:46:04] <tw2113> still seeing the same error above hyperking
[18:46:12] <hyperking> tw2113: best to view working example at hyperking.webfactional.com
[18:46:52] <doug65536> hyperking: ok
[18:46:54] <hyperking> tw2113: the fiddle is just to view the script file in question
[18:47:12] <doug65536> hyperking: yes, like that
[18:47:13] <ivanov_jaroslaw> doug65536: I put more slow animation.http://eva.perederey.com/portfolio/
[18:47:56] <hyperking> doug65536: However, this doesn't reload the currLoc after ajax call
[18:48:34] <doug65536> hyperking: probably because currLoc has nothing to do with the ajax call
[18:48:49] <doug65536> hyperking: where does it get currLoc from the incoming ajax response?
[18:49:46] <ivanov_jaroslaw> doug65536: So now when I move slier, fade out is working (5 sec), but fade in don't is not working (but last element get  vice versa behavior)
[18:49:58] <hyperking> doug65536: what i would like to do is create the variables in  my html script tags http://jsfiddle.net/SUmsG/1/
[18:50:27] <doug65536> hyperking: I am not following what you want to happen. either I am missing something or you expected for the currLoc to somehow magically change after the ajax response comes in
[18:51:13] <hyperking> doug65536: LOL! yes
[18:51:15] <doug65536> hyperking: currLoc is set once at the beginning - it has nothing to do with the ajax request, as far as I can see
[18:52:24] <hyperking> doug65536: so how is the title tags updating? I assume it would be possible to update the body class with the currLoc variable
[18:53:40] <doug65536> hyperking: you want to search through the ajax response data, extract the value of the "page" element. why do you have a 'page' tag anyway? that's not valid html. is it xhtml?
[18:54:40] <Roots47> Hey all, when you're using $(this) often, and store it as a variable, what do you normally name it?
[18:55:45] <tw2113> whatever you want the variable to be named?
[18:55:46] <hyperking> doug65536: I know its not valid. I made the tag to output the correct page slug...its very confusing...just trying to make it work
[18:55:52] <doug65536> Roots47: I name it item. it doesn't really matter
[18:56:14] <Roots47> Wasn't sure if there is some common convention
[18:56:18] <Roots47> var me = $(this) or something
[18:56:56] <doug65536> Roots47: for capturing 'this' in a closure, I use var self = this;
[18:57:17] <doug65536> Roots47: for capturing $(this), I generally use var item = $(this);
[18:57:23] <doug65536> not sure if there is a convention
[18:57:28] <Roots47> ok thanks
[19:11:14] <Mrgoose2>  Is this the correct place to ask a jquery mobile question?  I have a side panel that has buttons with links ( essentially using the side panel as global nav ) .  When i click links to go to different pages sometimes the side panel gets stuck open.  Anyone have any ideas around that?
[19:16:49] <FatalPriapism> So random question... are all the plugins listed on the jQuery site not included with the core? I see some that are very similar to core functions but idk...
[19:17:04] <RRR2>  no
[19:18:17] <FatalPriapism> thanks...I've been wondering about that for some time now
[19:18:53] <RRR2> What do you mean with core function
[19:18:56] <RRR2> functions*
[19:19:42] <RRR2> Well, these "plugins" simply edit jQuery's type prototype
[19:20:13] <FatalPriapism> fx jQuery UI Slider is a plugin, but jQuery UI already has a slider widget
[19:20:56] <RRR2> I don't think that's a core function
[19:22:08] <FatalPriapism> where's john resig when you need him haha
[19:22:30] <RRR2> Why do you need him?
[19:22:58] <FatalPriapism> well, seeing how we wrote jQuery...
[19:23:16] <RRR2> Yes...?
[19:23:50] <FatalPriapism> it was just a funny
[19:24:42] <RRR2> I don't seem to understand what you need. Any specific question you want answered?
[19:25:31] <FatalPriapism> not particularly, just the one I already asked
[19:28:19] <RRR2> You don't need John Resig to answer any specific question, you can read the doc, or read jQuery's source, if you want to complain about it, you can fill in a bug form, or fix it yourself then pull a request
[19:29:11] <FatalPriapism> dude...relax...nobodies complaining...it was a joke...
[19:29:44] <hyperking> how would I ge the base url form testdomain.com/category/math-test/ to show only "math-test" ?
[19:30:18] <FatalPriapism> ie in the address bar showing only "math-test"?
[19:35:39] <hyperking> FatalPriapism: no, just grabbing that section of the url only
[19:36:57] <hyperking> FatalPriapism: the address url stays the same. we just need to grab the value after the last "/"
[19:37:58] <ernston> hi
[19:38:14] <ernston> is it possible to create an if statement if coming from a certain page
[19:38:24] <FatalPriapism> have you tried something like: var curFile = window.location.pathname.split('/').pop();
[19:39:07] <FatalPriapism> ernston: does this need to be dynamically handled or do you definitely know the name of the page?
[19:39:50] <ernston> its actually a div within a page
[19:39:55] <ernston> am using jquery mobile
[19:40:00] <ernston> single page
[19:40:58] <FatalPriapism> ernston: I'll call the page something.html, so:    if(window.location.pathname == "something.html") { //code }
[19:42:16] <ernston> thanx ill try
[19:42:27] <FatalPriapism> np, good luck :)
[19:46:37] <hyperking> FatalPriapsism: big thanks!!

[19:55:08] <phrozensilver> anyone here ever make games using jquery?
[19:55:45] <Snerf> its javascript.. of course you can make a game from it

[19:56:45] <ernston> hi again
[19:56:46] <phrozensilver> more of anyone know an example of a game that uses JS / possibly jquery and gives the code for it?
[19:56:53] <ernston> can anyone help with this jquery mobile issue
[19:56:56] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/33/
[19:57:13] <FatalPriapism> phrozensilver: google open source javascript games
[19:57:27] <ernston> i have a search page, but the checkbox and slider input  cause the search input to stop auto completing
[19:57:27] <RRR2> phrozensilver: I made a snake game in JS, but the code is probably unreadable
[19:57:32] <FatalPriapism> RRR2: the game I work on is written in C#
[19:57:50] <RRR2> FatalPriapism: What is it about?
[19:58:20] <FatalPriapism> RRR2: it's an airline management simulation... akin to the old "Airline Tycoon"
[19:58:25] <ernston> for some reason using the other input elements stops the search autocomplete
[19:58:58] <RRR2> FatalPriapism: Very nice
[20:00:17] <FatalPriapism> RRR2: Yeah, I enjoy it. I've been trying to convince the guy who started the game to switch to Java or something more open-source but he doesn't want to learn a new language
[20:00:57] <RRR2> there's always reverse engineering
[20:01:02] <RRR2> I'm joking
[20:02:09] <FatalPriapism> RRR2: Java wouldn't be bad...it's incredibly similar to C#... I just don't have the time between work and whatnot
[20:02:38] <RRR2> I see
[20:02:42] <RRR2> so what do you code in freetime
[20:03:07] <FatalPriapism> I work as a web developer...and I do more of it in my free time
[20:03:28] <FatalPriapism> I love what I do, so I don't mind spending extra time doing it
[20:06:02] <FatalPriapism> what do you do?
[20:06:38] <RRR2> oh
[20:06:58] <RRR2> I read source code and specifications
[20:07:23] <RRR2> in my freetime
[20:07:34] <FatalPriapism> Do you work as a developer?

[20:20:30] <FatalPriapism> hyperking: shoot
[20:26:39] <joobz> hey guys.. is it possible to make a browser window transparent?
[20:26:49] <joobz> the window itself? or a popup window?
[20:27:12] <FatalPriapism> If by popup you mean a modal, then yes
[20:27:25] <joobz> a window itself
[20:27:35] <joobz> what im thinking is if jquery can make the window like an app itself
[20:27:49] <joobz> so it spawns a small window, say 200 x 100 in the bottom left of my screen
[20:27:54] <joobz> always ontop
[20:28:05] <joobz> even when it's not active.. but when it's not active, go transparent
[20:28:19] <joobz> hover over the window then make it active
[20:28:31] <joobz> not sure if jquery can do this sorta stuff these days
[20:28:47] <FatalPriapism> you could do something like $('html').css('opacity','0.5');
[20:29:01] <joobz> FatalPriapism, im talking about the browser window itself
[20:29:05] <joobz> or a popup window of the browser
[20:29:10] <joobz> not the markup within it
[20:29:32] <FatalPriapism> That would be more in the realm of browser extensions
[20:29:45] <Mrgoose2>  Is this the correct place to ask a jquery mobile question?  I have a side panel that has buttons with links ( essentially using the side panel as global nav ) .  When i click links to go to different pages sometimes the side panel gets stuck open.  Anyone have any ideas around that?
[20:30:11] <RRR2> I think firefox can achieve it
[20:30:30] <RRR2> or Chrome too maybe, but many users wouldn't like it at all
[20:30:45] <joobz> RRR2 are you talking to me or Mrgoose2 ?
[20:30:50] <FatalPriapism> play with the page all you want, play with the browser, you're asking for trouble
[20:30:51] <RRR2> to you
[20:30:54] <joobz> oh
[20:30:59] <joobz> how can it be done?
[20:31:07] <joobz> this is an intended app btw, for internal use
[20:31:08] <RRR2> Well
[20:31:24] <RRR2> For windows, you can make a DLL that somehow makes other processes transparent
[20:31:34] <joobz> ahh
[20:31:35] <RRR2> then you make an extension that calls that DLL
[20:31:40] <joobz> so it would need to be .net based ya?
[20:32:00] <RRR2> Not necesarilly
[20:32:07] <joobz> mm?
[20:32:27] <RRR2> Why would it have to be .net based?
[20:35:38] <joobz> for it to support windows
[20:36:03] <FatalPriapism> Again, why would it have to be .net based? .net is just a framework for a language, much as jQuery to JS
[20:36:45] <joobz> application window transparency
[20:36:49] <joobz> under windows
[20:36:54] <joobz> can it be done without .net?
[20:36:56] <RRR2> you use Win API
[20:37:01] <RRR2> Yes
[20:38:11] <joobz> are you leading me down the route of writing a BATCH / VBscript ? :)
[20:38:14] <joobz> .. to avoid .net
[20:38:20] <RRR2> No?
[20:38:38] <RRR2> I am leading you to the route of using Win API in any language you want
[20:38:48] <RRR2> even x86 assembly
[20:38:52] <FatalPriapism> fortran...
[20:39:04] <RRR2> C,C++,C#
[20:39:11] <FatalPriapism> perl, python,pascal
[20:39:51] <RRR2> A whole new world has been uncovered to you
[20:41:02] <joobz> i duno.. i am sceptical if you are trying to uncover cscript.exe here
[20:41:07] <joobz> or a proper platform..
[20:41:08] <joobz> :)
[20:41:25] <RRR2> wot
[20:41:44] <joobz> just joking bro :)
[20:41:51] <FatalPriapism> we're just telling you to cook the damn noodles. it doesn't matter if you do it on the stove or in the microwave
[20:41:56] <FatalPriapism> :)
[20:42:05] <RRR2> You seem to have a phobia towards batch or VBScript
[20:42:22] <FatalPriapism> <-- has a phobia towards windows. ick.
[20:43:01] <joobz> doing a windows based application window that supports jquery and transparency is a stretch of vbscript / batch (cant be done in batch?)
[20:43:12] <RRR2> NO
[20:43:23] <RRR2> System calls have nothing to do with VBScript
[20:43:27] <joobz> ive just done bits of code before that have taken me weeks and complex code .. and then later i stumble across a quick and easy way
[20:43:31] <RRR2> System calls are on the kernel!
[20:43:40] <FatalPriapism> lulz
[20:43:50] <joobz> bro, i dont want to write this using ASM
[20:43:57] <RRR2> Use C
[20:44:16] <joobz> what about C# ?
[20:44:22] <RRR2> ..
[20:44:27] <RRR2> yes, that works too
[20:44:46] <RRR2> you have short-term memory
[20:44:50] <FatalPriapism> use the power button. I can guarantee that will fade out every window you've got :P
[20:45:55] <joobz> RRR2 are you talking to me or Mrgoose2 ?
[20:46:12] <RRR2> leave
[20:46:13] <joobz> FatalPriapism, can i gradually fade it out with the power button?
[20:46:14] <FatalPriapism> wot?
[20:46:35] <FatalPriapism> joobz: sure, the longer you hold the power button, the quicker it will fade out
[20:46:46] <joobz> FatalPriapism, what about slow fade out?
[20:46:49] <joobz> progressive
[20:47:26] <FatalPriapism> are you serious?
[20:47:38] <joobz> FatalPriapism, what do you think?
[20:48:08] <FatalPriapism> Based on some of what I've seen you say...I have to ask...
[20:49:21] <joobz> FatalPriapism, heh
[20:52:05] <vis> hey all i have successfully implemented the code in this tutorial http://youneedfat.com/genesis-responsive-design-menu/ in my theme however I was wondering if someone would be willing to help me modify the code to make it so that the menu does not show up on page load
[20:52:47] <FatalPriapism> Do you want to hide it all together or delay the loading?
[20:52:56] <RRR2> does it hides it with CSS
[20:53:05] <vis> I want to delay loading until the button is clicked
[20:53:34] <RRR2> You can load it with JS
[20:53:36] <RRR2> LOL
[20:53:51] <vis> right.. i dont know js.. i am a CSS person
[20:53:57] <RRR2> Oh
[20:54:02] <vis> i am asking if you can tell me what i need to change in JS
[20:54:27] <RRR2> Well, there's nothing much you can do, you could hide the content until everything is loaded but that is considered bad practice
[20:54:30] <FatalPriapism> $('#button').click(function() { $('#someMenu').toggle(); })
[20:55:01] <RRR2> Or maybe I'm misinterpreting you
[20:55:20] <FatalPriapism> In your css:   #someMenu { display: none; }
[21:01:44] <vis> thanks guys!

[22:47:01] <grafi> APane seems to me you need a better way of determining when to show those guides ?
[22:49:37] <grafi> e.g. check what page are you on before  showing the guides
[22:50:16] <grafi> also I would make damn sure to set a cookie once the guide has been finisched closed, showing the thing everytime a user visits will be annoying as fuck
[22:51:06] <lesterc> guys - is there a jquery plugin for something similar to extdirect in extjs?
[22:52:15] <grafi> no idea lesterc
[22:53:23] <lesterc> grafi: not the answer that I was expecting but thanks. :)
[22:53:49] <grafi> dont even know what extdirect is ^^
[22:54:22] <lesterc> let me rephrase it - is there a easy to to call server side functions in jquery/plain js and have the return value automagically converted into javascript data types?
[22:54:57] <lesterc> extdirect is a spec which server-side framework can implement to convert function/data between server and client.
[22:55:17] <lesterc> so you can implement shit in server and expose them in javascript land.
[22:56:38] <grafi> so i call my backend to give me some values and attach them to the window ?
[22:57:26] <lesterc> grafi: server functions exposed in js-land
[22:57:34] <grafi> functions
[22:57:35] <grafi> hm
[22:57:45] <grafi> then the answer is still no :P
[22:57:57] <lesterc> and return input/return values gets converted automatically.
[22:58:51] <lesterc> grafi: that's okay.
[22:59:31] <APane> grafi, exactly
[22:59:46] <APane> thats what' i'm dealing with now. how do i add a cookie to get this to stop poppin' up
[23:02:22] <grafi> https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie APane if you want another library, otherwise do some research on cookie creation with javascript
[23:02:53] <grafi> lesterc sounds cool that thingie
[23:03:53] <APane> grafi, yup i've tried jquery cookie
[23:04:07] <grafi> doesnt work?
[23:04:07] <APane> didn't work for me, then again i probably set it up wrong :/
[23:04:24] <APane> how do you set the cookie? this is what i did.
[23:04:28] <APane> $.cookie('guides', 'true')
[23:04:36] <grafi> where is it you setup your guide anyway? couldnt find it in the pagesource
[23:04:36] <APane> in a new cookie.js
[23:04:52] <APane> I've built the app in rails
[23:05:04] <APane> so the jquery tutorial is in the apps assets/javascript
[23:05:22] <APane> but it displays everywhere! i'd like it to display once and that's it per user
[23:10:18] <lesterc>  grafi: found this on github - might be of interest if you do python: https://github.com/fergalwalsh/pico
[23:36:00] <doug65536> after almost 24 hours, chrome finally finished initializing my 1 million <input> fiddle
[23:37:03] <doug65536> chrome needs 5.9GB of RAM to show a 1 million input field form
[23:38:18] <doug65536> avg 6.3KB per input field
[23:51:26] <motaka2> how to determine a jquery object is a selectbox ?
[23:51:49] <motaka2> $this.is("select") does not work
[23:52:59] <motaka2> doug65536: Do u know the answer?
[23:53:00] <ravenzz> then you are doing something wrong
[23:53:11] <motaka2> ravenzz: My answer?
[23:53:16] <ravenzz> yeah
[23:53:27] <motaka2> ok lemme show you the code
[23:53:37] <ravenzz> ok
[23:54:11] <motaka2> ravenzz: http://codepaste.net/88duwi
[23:54:47] <ravenzz> eheh
[23:54:49] <ravenzz> $('#egyUnitsShlsInfoFormsForm input') <-
[23:55:01] <motaka2> :)
[23:55:10] <motaka2> ravenzz: thanks
[23:56:14] <motaka2> ravenzz: what about this?  $('#egyUnitsShlsInfoFormsForm:input')
[23:57:04] <ravenzz> man a select is not an input... that's obvious
[23:57:06] <ravenzz> I guess
[23:57:34] <ravenzz> maybe you can do something like this $('#egyUnitsShlsInfoFormsForm').find('select, input, textarea')
[23:58:12] <motaka2> ravenzz: :input works it selects all type of fom elements. thanks for ur care
[23:59:06] <ravenzz> ah ok i didn't see the colon
[23:59:13] * ravenzz hungover :)
