[01:47:21] <Babu_> Doubt in autocomplet jquery..
[01:47:42] <Babu_> hi..
[01:47:58] <Flo0815> hi
[01:48:26] <Babu_> I using auto complete jquery.. I need proper locationt to download it.
[01:48:54] <Flo0815> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[01:49:29] <Babu_> Can we use both ajax call and non ajax call in the same jquery..
[01:49:39] <Flo0815> ?
[01:49:43] <Flo0815> what is a non ajax call
[01:50:07] <Babu_> It means from static list of values in a array format..
[01:50:43] <Flo0815> ?! i really don't know what u try to tell me
[01:51:59] <Babu_> I have two auto complete fields. One is ajax auto complete and another one is from static menu values..
[01:52:07] <Flo0815> ok
[01:52:10] <Flo0815> so?
[01:52:35] <batmanian> I am looking for a jQuery plugin for helping me create pop over divs
[01:52:40] <batmanian> Anything you can recommend?
[01:52:50] <Flo0815> jquery ui -> dialog
[01:54:07] <Babu_> Initially i downloaded ajax auto complete from http://www.devbridge.com/projects/autocomplete/jquery/  this location. But i doesn't support both the actions.
[01:57:06] <Babu_> In my organistion we using 1.7 version. As per ur link in the version 1.7.3, their is no autocomplete js
[02:01:57] <Babu_> hi
[02:03:45] <Babu_> hi
[02:06:24] <Babu_> Thank you flo0815 for answering..
[02:06:26] <LukeNukem> Babu_, jquery UI has auto complete
[02:06:58] <Babu_> But i need in 1.7.3 version is their?
[02:09:20] <Babu_> Or give me exact path to 'Ajax auto complete' of the stable version..
[02:13:45] <Blaster> hello any idea if my syntax is correct?  I'm trying to append an anchor to a div on page load http://jsfiddle.net/qUrhh/
[02:13:58] <Blaster> Im having trouble determining why it's not being appended
[02:14:23] <Eviltwin> The problem is on the left hand side, left of the code
[02:14:46] <Blaster> ah I forgot to specify JQuery
[02:16:34] <Blaster> if I do an append of a new element inside an AJAX callbacl function, is it not possible to have an event handler for that element outside of the function?
[02:17:21] <Blaster> actually its probably a good idea to put those handlers inside the function
[02:17:34] <Eviltwin> Blaster: It's possible to have an event handler for the element outside but it's not possible to bind to that element before it's created
[02:17:51] <Eviltwin> The handler is just a function, it's binding it that makes it run when events happen
[02:18:20] <Blaster> so is it best practice to just put the handlers inside the callback?
[02:19:06] <Eviltwin> Depends on how much they do
[02:19:13] <Eviltwin> If it's going to be like 50 lines of code then probably not
[02:19:21] <xec> delegate?
[02:19:22] <Eviltwin> If it's less than about 5, then why not
[02:19:44] <Blaster> and if you put it outside how do you bind it properly?
[02:19:46] <Eviltwin> xec: Delegate doesn't actually bind to that element so I'm still correct
[02:20:08] <xec> yes, i i realize, i just think it would be sufficient for Blaster's needs
[02:21:08] <Eviltwin> Blaster: http://jsfiddle.net/yGssw/
[02:21:17] <alex__> hi! I'm developing some stuff with jquery-mobile and in one form (only on iphone) one of the filed is jumped when you click on next. Can this be fixed?
[02:21:18] <ducanh> hello
[02:21:26] <Eviltwin> xec: It's inefficient to use .delegate if your goal is to target one specific element
[02:22:14] <xec> Eviltwin: as in performance-wise?
[02:22:27] <xec> or, clumsy code
[02:23:04] <Eviltwin> xec: Mostly performance. jQuery does a good job of making the code pretty simple
[02:23:42] <Blaster> console.log("clicked", this);  what does that second argument do?
[02:24:14] <Blaster> nvm Im going to look @ http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API
[02:24:15] <xec> Blaster: .log takes as many arguments as you want and logs them all
[02:31:13] <xec> Blaster: this is what you could do if you want to create an event handler before the elements exist in the DOM: http://jsfiddle.net/snXCS/
[02:33:21] <muka> Hi, I'm binding to $.ajaxSetup({ complete: ... });
[02:34:24] <muka> Hi, I'm binding to $.ajaxSetup({ complete: ... }); using console.log(arguments); I get 3 log lines for each request. Is this correct behavior or are some duplicated calls ?? Thanks
[02:52:26] <jsk143> gud noon
[02:53:19] <jsk143> i have one doubt about.....i have two json file.....1 s getting and display the labels and textboxes and another1 s to get the textbox  values based on label values and send to the backend...its possible in jquery
[02:53:32] <rosieres> Hi, got a noob question. why is my variable undefined in this case ? -> http://jsfiddle.net/nHB4n/
[02:53:32] <jsk143> without serialization concept
[03:01:24] <nFFF> rosieres, within jsfiddle, I don't think global this refers to document
[03:01:37] <nFFF> plus you only need to do document.URL
[03:01:53] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/nHB4n/4/
[03:02:14] <batmanian> in jquery ui event callbacks like this: function(event, ui) { ... } what is ui?
[03:04:14] <nFFF> jsk143, global this in jsfiddle refers to window, so this.location
[03:04:40] <rosieres> nFFF k. Thank YOU!
[03:15:02] <Innocentus> hi
[03:15:46] <Innocentus> How do you manage JQuery plugins?
[03:15:50] <Innocentus> How do you keep them updated?
[03:16:21] <Innocentus> Not all JQuery plugins are managed by svn
[03:16:41] <Innocentus> And how do you manage them in multiple sites?
[03:16:48] <Innocentus> I am eager to know.
[03:18:22] <Blaster> is there a way to append elements to the page before document ready?  I'm seeing a noticable jump when my elements are inserted after page load
[03:20:35] <Flo0815> Blaster: hide the elements, append them, then show them
[03:21:25] <Blaster> so fade them in or something
[03:22:37] <Flo0815> or just .show()
[03:23:18] <Blaster> then I see the jump
[03:23:27] <Blaster> because its being inserted between 2 elements vertically
[03:23:45] <Flo0815> set the css: display: none;
[03:24:00] <Flo0815> then append all elements u want to append and as callback -> elements.show();
[03:28:39] <Blaster> the split second it takes to $.getJSON causes a visual delay before the elements pop in
[03:30:17] <Flo0815> can u show a jsfiddle
[03:30:47] <Blaster> I might not be able to simulate the delay for you
[03:31:02] <Blaster> Will try though
[03:37:19] <Blaster> doesn't seem jsfiddle wants me to make ajax calls
[03:49:42] <Joeboy> Hi. Is there some way I can get $(something).replaceWith('</a> blah <a href="blah">') to work, without 'tidying' the <a> tags? Or do I need to rewrite the whole outer element?
[03:50:06] <Joeboy> I get blah <a..></a> from that
[03:50:59] <xh> hi! trying to attach a jquery ui tooltip on a table cell; the actual tooltip content is in a <div class='tooltip'>; for some strange reason half of the time the tooltip does not disappear on mouseout; could anyone please help identify what am i doing wrong? http://pastie.org/3634005
[03:51:55] <adept> xh: You might be better putting your pastie in to jsfiddle
[03:52:19] <adept> xh: allows you to run / edit it online and others to help by modifying / viewing the code
[03:52:33] <xh> adept: aha, ok, will try it
[03:54:38] <adept> xh: whats the url for your tooltip() js file?
[03:55:17] <adept> xh: have you got a hosted version?
[03:56:37] <BarisW> I have a fixed footer in an overlay. When I print the contents of the overlay, I'd like the footer to be printed on every page instead of just on the last page. Is this possible?
[03:56:53] <xh> adept: the url is privided by the framework, it is in a jar file for tapestry
[03:58:02] <xh> adept: it looks like @Import(library = "${assets.path}/mixins/tooltip/jquery.ui.tooltip.js", stylesheet = "${assets.path}/mixins/tooltip/jquery.ui.tooltip.css") public class OverviewSupply.. probably not very useful
[03:58:23] <adept> no but it tells me that it's using jquery ui's tooltip
[03:58:44] <juho3> http://haaveri.org/~juho3/test/ I have a problem here. When I drag an element onto the grid the rotate & delete buttons on the element don't work. They work from the menu though.
[03:58:45] <xh> adept: yes, that's what i originally wrote
[03:58:57] <juho3> I'm probably doing something really, really wrong
[03:59:06] <adept> have you put your script in jsfiddle yet? Make sure to check the LHS to ensure you have the correct jquery & jquery ui libs selected. You may need to paste your jquery ui css file in teh css panel too
[03:59:45] <adept> xh: jsfiddle is great for messing around with stuff like this :D
[04:00:21] <xh> adept: yes, trying to extract a version will less garbage
[04:00:50] <adept> xh: ha ha... always fun :D
[04:01:37] <xh> adept: atomizing is always fun :)
[04:13:30] <sorush20> hi
[04:13:48] <beasty> hi
[04:14:22] <sorush20> www.sorushnazari.com/tiempolatinolondres there is a jquery conflict but there are dots on the count down that don't seem to work. Question: what are those circle dots?
[04:15:17] <sorush20> I can't seem to identify them ..
[04:15:24] <sorush20> what are they and where are they from?
[04:16:27] <beasty> sorush20: <li>
[04:16:38] <Flo0815> sorush20: there is a typo -> $$
[04:17:00] <beasty> sorush20: add list-style: none; to your li's stylesheet
[04:17:22] <Flo0815> sorush20: $('a_modal')... not $$('a_modal')...
[04:17:58] <Flo0815> sorush20: or use $(this) instead of el
[04:20:00] <Flo0815> sorush20: ur using mootools and jquery, so the $ gets overwritten i think, maybe try jQuery('a_modal').each...
[04:20:25] <tankburger> Hi people! I was wondering about HTML-encoding of the content in input boxes. I mean, I want people to be able to enter all characthers without risk of inserting HTML that breaks the code. I've tried the escape() function, but the way I've implemented it, doesnt work very well. What would be a sensible approach to secure the content of the input boxes?
[04:21:14] <Flo0815> what happens with the entered text?
[04:21:25] <juho3> http://haaveri.org/~juho3/test/ I have a problem here. When I drag an element onto the grid the rotate & delete buttons on the element don't work. They work from the menu though.
[04:21:33] <Flo0815> u send it to a php file? save it in a databse?
[04:21:41] <juho3> is the problem somehow related to the fact that the element is cloned onto the grid
[04:21:41] <tankburger> goes to a database
[04:21:47] <juho3> because the deleting does work from the original
[04:22:08] <Flo0815> tankburger: so u can use mysql_real_escape_string or html_special_chars
[04:22:12] <Flo0815> in php
[04:22:22] <tankburger> oh its c#
[04:22:26] <Flo0815> oh
[04:22:27] <tankburger> mvc site
[04:22:35] <sorush20> now I'm completely lost.. I think list style on the countdown.css is already none
[04:23:05] <Flo0815> but it's the same, a verification in javascript is not very common
[04:23:11] <tankburger> I had a function that just replaced every character in the input
[04:23:29] <tankburger> well, every "dangerous" char
[04:23:48] <Flo0815> google for SQL Injection
[04:23:57] <sorush20> gone thanks all.. worked
[04:24:10] <Flo0815> or securing user inputs
[04:24:46] <tankburger> yeah, ive done that, but hmm, couldnt find anything useful..
[04:24:51] <tankburger> Ill try again
[04:25:26] <sorush20> the countdown animation is not happening what could the problem be.. the origianl script is 1.4.3 and I have included that in the header but the other component (slide show) is not 1.4.7
[04:26:33] <Flo0815> sorush20: what is not happening? i can see the countdown
[04:27:53] * adept is back
[04:28:10] <Innocentus> hi
[04:28:11] <Innocentus> I want to know how you manage your jquery plugins
[04:28:13] <Innocentus> How do you keep them updated?
[04:28:14] <Innocentus> And how do you manage them for multiple sites?
[04:28:19] <Innocentus> Where do you store them and how do you store custom plugins?
[04:28:20] <sorush20> the countdown jquery is version 1.4.3 but the slideshow is version 1.5.2. What can I do to resolve the conflict
[04:28:22] <Innocentus> Glad to know
[04:28:48] <adept> Innocentus: You can manage things like that with a decent deployment and dev plan. How are you managing it at the moment?
[04:29:45] <Innocentus> adept: /js/library/jquery/plugins/<plugin-name>/plugin-name.js and plugin-name.min.js
[04:29:50] <Innocentus> I don't think this is optimal
[04:30:19] <Ghan> hello jQuery ppl
[04:30:21] <Innocentus> the jquery library resides in /js/library/jquery/dist/jquery.versionwhatever.js and jquery.versionwhatever.min.js
[04:30:41] <Ghan> anyone have experience with OneStepCheckout for Magento?
[04:30:42] <adept> well the file structure is a personal choice. I tend to put all my js resources in a js folder in the root (as most do) and then seperate out libs etc etc
[04:31:11] <Innocentus> can you give me an example
[04:31:18] <adept> Innocentus: I missunderstood, I thought your query was how to maintain your js codebase over multiple projects in dev as well as live
[04:31:30] <Innocentus> adept: right, there are multiple projects
[04:31:38] <Innocentus> they all got the same folder structure
[04:31:57] <adept> Innocentus: When it comes to folder structure it really is personal choice unless a framework / lib dictates otherwise. Some CMS's for example
[04:32:01] <Innocentus> I want to manage it more effectively, because I don't want to check all projects and their plugins individually
[04:32:07] <Innocentus> adept: I use Zend Framework
[04:32:24] <Innocentus> adept: are there any recommended practices by jquery or you?
[04:32:58] <Innocentus> because currently the css and js are splattered througout the public-folder which means I have to check them all individually - this is quite ineffective
[04:34:03] <adept> Innocentus: Right, well say for example I work on 10 projects and all require jquery, jquery ui and a few other core libs. I could host them on my local server in a folder accessible to each project so I only have 1 copy of them core files. When it comes to deployment you can use app's like Phing to automate deployment. So you can get it to take your local dev release, minify code, replace JS
[04:34:06] <adept> libs with links to the latest revisions, update mysql tables, ftp and even rollback
[04:34:42] <Innocentus> yes, I heard many times from phing - seems very practical
[04:35:08] <adept> Linked with something like GitHub it's great
[04:35:23] <Innocentus> adept: this public shared folder sounds good, but how can I somehow emulate that all projects got it as an own public folder?
[04:35:38] <Innocentus> adept: because it shouldn't be visible to outside that they share one public folder
[04:35:49] <adept> what web platform are you running?
[04:36:00] <Ghan> http://pastebin.com/MZA9eZkK
[04:36:11] <Ghan> this shows fields from a previous step in the cart
[04:36:32] <Ghan> i need to show the field with id "id_comments" in the same way as all the other fields
[04:36:42] <Ghan> some help will be greatly appreciated!!!!!
[04:36:47] <Ghan> i'm stuck!
[04:36:48] <Ghan> :(
[04:37:03] <Innocentus> adept: they all base on Zend Framework
[04:37:22] <adept> Ok, I use that
[04:37:22] <Innocentus> adept: they all got a js-folder
[04:37:40] <adept> What's your web server running? Apache I presume?
[04:37:50] <adept> or are you on IIS
[04:38:22] <Innocentus> adept: apache2 on debian 5
[04:38:37] <Innocentus> adept: with confixx
[04:38:40] <adept> Innocentus: Are you saying you have multiple Zend Framework projects running from the same public folder?
[04:39:01] <Innocentus> adept: no, each webproject got its own folder where a application folder and a public folder resides in
[04:39:13] <Innocentus> adept: they are isolated but they share the zend framework library
[04:39:42] <adept> and what url are you browsing to view your local versions?
[04:39:51] <adept> are you using virtualhosts?
[04:39:54] <Innocentus> yes
[04:40:58] <adept> right, well you can assign a new virtualhost for example http://js-libs.local
[04:41:09] <Innocentus> ah
[04:41:12] <adept> bang all your JS files in the web_root
[04:41:29] <adept> link to that address in all projects
[04:41:37] <Innocentus> adept: yes, this is nice
[04:41:47] <adept> saves you updating each, but means if something breaks in one, it breaks in them all
[04:41:58] <dr0id> heh
[04:42:03] <Innocentus> adept: so we got a shared-public folder
[04:42:11] <adept> when you deply dev > staging, you swap the links
[04:42:31] <Innocentus> adept: is it also possible to make it look to the outside world that each website got an own public folder? or is this much harder to archieve?
[04:42:52] <Innocentus> adept: a public shared folder is great, but the user shouldn't see that there is a shared source for js
[04:43:23] <adept> I'm not quite understanding?
[04:43:51] <Innocentus> adept: how can domain.tld/public/js/ and domain2.tld/public/js and so on access the same shared public folder?
[04:44:27] <Innocentus> adept: because the outside world shouldn't see there is a single public folder
[04:44:53] <Innocentus> adept: but if this isn't possible, I will do it as you said and use a separate domain for public shared folder
[04:45:14] <adept> in fact if you edit your app.ini you can assign a JS base_url for your DEV:ENV and the real one for your LIVE:ENV and then extend $this->headLink()->appendStylesheet() to choose the correct url for the app:env
[04:45:43] <adept> or make a check against the url
[04:46:13] <Innocentus> adept: ah
[04:46:18] <xh> adept: the distilled use case: http://jsfiddle.net/SF2xy/12/ - question is how to what is the proper way to get the tooltip div to display on mouse over a TD?
[04:46:20] <Innocentus> adept: this is a good idea
[04:46:56] <adept> h: there is no 'proper' way I gues. Personal choice.
[04:47:13] <xh> adept: at least a working way )
[04:47:26] <adept> xh: I 'personally' tend to create a new DOM element and populate the tooltip from element data :)
[04:47:45] <adept> I think having tooltips hidden in your code bloats it unecesserily
[04:47:48] <adept> (god I spelt that sooo wrong)
[04:48:11] <xh> adept: i don't have much control over this, the divs are supposed to be static
[04:48:22] <adept> no worries :D
[04:48:26] <adept> let me take a look then
[04:49:04] <Innocentus> adept: thanks
[04:50:47] <Innocentus> adept: could you give me an example how you organized your jquery-js files? I currently use /js/library/jquery/plugins
[04:51:01] <Innocentus> adept: but how to differentiate between own custom plugins and 3rd party plugins?
[04:51:42] <adept> xh: I'm struggling to find any documentation on tooltip. Are you sure it's contained with jqeury?
[04:51:51] <adept> sorry jqury ui
[04:51:57] <xh> it comes with jquery-ui
[04:52:16] <adept> xh: which version?
[04:52:44] <joehannes> hey guys, just wanted to report a bug on the jquery site but dev.jquery seems to be down
[04:52:47] <xh> adept: hm, 1.7.xx i guess
[04:52:53] <xh> adept: not sure
[04:53:03] <joehannes> so I thougt maybe somebody in here would consider the issue
[04:53:10] <xh> adept: the 'official' docs are at http://jquery.github.com/jquery-docs/jquery-ui/tooltip/tooltip.xml
[04:53:15] <adept> there's nothing about it here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[04:53:30] <xh> adept: there is here: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip
[04:53:34] <adept> ah ok will check it
[04:54:09] <joehannes> jquery.height and jquery.width don't seem to work properly in Chrome (works in FF ... not tested anywhere else, no time, but maybe Safari is an issue too)
[04:55:01] <joehannes> it doesn't display the correct size, but 1 or 2 or even more on bigger pictures? less than the actual dimension
[04:55:19] <adept> xh: When I strip what you've done to the most basic form I get the error:
[04:55:19] <adept> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'tooltip'
[04:55:40] <adept> suggest it's not included in the jquery ui lib on jsfiddle. 1 sec fella :D
[04:55:41] <joehannes> using img.naturalWidth/Height solves the issue in Chrome ... (maybe Safari) .. so I though jquery should incorporate that into $.height $.width :)
[04:55:55] <joehannes> hope somebody heard who can report, cheers
[04:56:07] <joehannes> tested on jquery 1.7.1
[04:57:52] <xh> adept: it works with the current git
[04:58:33] <adept> just added it as a resource to jsfiddle. 1 sec

[04:59:13] <zedar187> when does the 'ajax.done' command get executed? how does jquery know if the request was successful or not? do i have to define an error-return-code in my e.g. "url: contactmailer.php"?
[05:00:06] <adept> xh: It still doesn't work
[05:01:10] <xh> adept: hm, maybe the particular js are not included, i suppose
[05:02:01] <adept> I dunno
[05:02:03] <xh> adept: i used this: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui.git
[05:02:09] <adept> It would be simpler to quickly write one you know?
[05:02:35] <sorush20> can I use multiple jquery scripts on one page?
[05:03:28] <xh> adept: here is the official visual test: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/visual/tooltip/tooltip.html
[05:06:41] <adept> xh: Not got it fixed, but this is a simple solution?
[05:06:41] <adept> http://jsfiddle.net/SF2xy/15/
[05:06:51] <adept> you don't need the extra tooltip library either
[05:06:57] <adept> done in a few lines of jqeury
[05:07:35] <xh> adept: wow, cool, will try it
[05:07:50] <adept> you can easily modify it to fade, move with the mouse etc. All down to how creative you want to be
[05:08:21] <xh> adept: perfect! thank a ton!
[05:08:39] <adept> sometimes the simplist solutions are best :)
[05:08:46] <adept> simpelist?
[05:08:49] * adept shoots his typist
[05:09:03] <iivvoo> I'm looking for a stable jquery slider widget that can replace <input type="text"> elements
[05:09:22] <xh> adept: these are two different type of simplicity:)
[05:09:33] <iivvoo> jquery.ui seems to work on div's with no special support for form elements
[05:09:44] <adept> iivvoo: What do you mean bud?
[05:10:13] <adept> xh: ha ha... too true. Have you used jquery much?
[05:10:37] <xh> adept: probably not much, but spent lots of time on it
[05:10:55] <adept> it's great once you break the back of it
[05:11:08] <adept> get a few cheatsheets
[05:11:15] <adept> they'll help as a quick reference
[05:11:50] <iivvoo> adept: a alider control that allows the user to select a value within a range that replaces text inputs
[05:12:03] <xh> adept: it is beautiful, in my opinion, but.. instead i have to do java; i'd actually prefer python, but that is already going off-topic
[05:12:05] <iivvoo> similar to html5 range inputs
[05:12:41] <adept> iivvoo: getcha. So you have 2x inputs in the html however the plugin replaces them for a slider?
[05:13:15] <iivvoo> just one input actually, where a user can type a value, and in steads select the value using a slider
[05:13:26] <iivvoo> (and then I have 15 of those, but that's not relevant)
[05:14:00] <nabax> hi
[05:14:01] <iivvoo> http://jsfiddle.net/LucP/BPdKR/2/ does what I need, but I have my doubts about its maturity
[05:14:17] <nabax> I'm trying to read the contents of an HTML file into a div, like this:
[05:14:27] <nabax> $('#contents').load('file.html');
[05:14:53] <nabax> but I get the following error: XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///myPath/file.html. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[05:15:12] <nabax> any ideas?
[05:15:55] <iivvoo> nabax do you really plan to load local files, or is that just your development setup?
[05:16:07] <nabax> iivvoo, just my development setup :)
[05:16:14] <iivvoo> it's probably better to run a local webserver to serve them
[05:16:25] <nabax> oh this could be causing the problem?
[05:16:29] <iivvoo> yeah
[05:17:22] <nabax> iivvoo, thanks! working now :)
[05:18:20] <Defusal> is there any jquery-ui specific channel?
[05:20:11] <adept> iivvoo: I've used this before:
[05:20:11] <adept> http://jquerytools.org/release-notes/index.html
[05:20:57] <adept> Defusal I think  #jqueryui-dev
[05:23:00] <Defusal> well thats specifically for dev adept
[05:23:32] <adept> Defusal:... Sorry
[05:23:38] <Defusal> i want to know how i can place an "ajax spinner" loading indicator in a button
[05:24:44] <Cork> Defusal: <button><span class="spinner"></span> text</button>
[05:24:52] <nights``> hm
[05:25:11] <Defusal> Cork, well, what about transparency and stuff
[05:25:30] <Cork> well you can't really do that with gif
[05:25:31] <adept> cork +1
[05:25:34] <nights``> how would you guys construct a time selection area where you can select hours and day anytime after present time?
[05:25:53] <Cork> Defusal: only way is to do the spinner with svg or js then
[05:25:55] <nights``> without having to do an ajax call if they change from today to another day
[05:26:07] <Defusal> Cork: i see one way libraies that use jQuery UI use is a png with multiple images under each other and use js to limit and move the image
[05:26:20] <Defusal> i was hoping someone could point me to something like that for a button
[05:26:24] <adept> Defusal: sprite animation
[05:26:32] <Defusal> surely im not the first person to need this?
[05:26:55] <Cork> Defusal: you could reuse the jquery ui icon feature
[05:27:05] <Cork> but use your own sprite class on it
[05:27:19] <Cork> then just change the class on the icon to show the next instance of the icon
[05:27:20] <adept> defusal: the term is sprite animation, where you have a sprite image with each frame and reposition it within a viewport
[05:32:03] <Defusal> ok, i hope i can find docs on this then
[05:32:03] <Defusal> can't afford to waste much time on it
[05:32:04] <adept> defusal: push back on it then. Is it something that is critical to the project that you can't afford to waste time on?
[05:32:05] <Defusal> adept, i just want a nice loading indicator, the whole platform uses web sockets and is highly interactive
[05:32:05] <Defusal> hopefully it doesn't cause too much of a headache, i'd think this is something reasonably common
[05:32:06] <adept> getcha
[05:32:06] <Cork> Defusal: if you dependn websocket i would use svg
[05:32:15] <Cork> then you don't need to get the headace at all
[05:32:29] <Cork> svg is supported by all browsers that support websocket
[05:32:33] <Defusal> Cork, well i thought i would reuse this for the main site that is not html5
[05:32:40] <Defusal> but that may be quicker
[05:33:22] <Cork> Defusal: or you could just use the css tarnsform: rotate(<nr>deg);
[05:33:24] <Cork> :)
[05:33:32] <Cork> then all you need is a png file ;)
[05:33:59] <Defusal> not a bad idea either
[05:34:19] <Cork> *transform
[05:35:17] <xec> Defusal: i've used this without much struggle: http://davidwalsh.name/dw-content/spin-js.php
[05:35:38] <Jibou> hi all
[05:36:32] <Defusal> xec, that is cool :)
[05:37:02] <xec> of course, all it does is that sort of spinner, not amazingly flexible if you want something different
[05:37:56] <Defusal> i just want to place it in a button without hassle :)
[05:45:59] <anli_> Why is a jquery version released that causes warnings or errors in firebug?
[05:46:06] <anli_> Its so strange
[05:46:49] <Cork> console errors has a history of getting ignored in jquery development
[05:47:13] <Cork> well not errors but warnings
[05:50:48] <Angelos_> My jQuery on my site doesn't work. The top area is suppose to be a slider. It's from sexy slider, it works locally in a separate file but not in this one. www.pricklypearmedia.com
[05:51:12] <Angelos_> I am not too good at debugging, I am sure it's only something small I missed
[05:52:42] <nights``> anyone know a good component to select date and time  (AFTER CURRENT date:time)
[05:52:43] <nights``> ?
[05:52:55] <Owkkuri> Angelos_: I get "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'SexySlider'" in my console, you've probably forgotten to include a js file somewhere
[05:53:39] <Angelos_> I included the js file in the top   <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.pricklypearmedia.com/wp-content/themes/prickly/scripts/jquery.sexyslider.min.js"></script>
[05:54:20] <Cork> Angelos_: try waiting for domready
[05:54:33] <Cork> SexySlider isn't loaded when you call it
[05:54:37] <Owkkuri> Aye, I had a similar issue with auto complete a while back, try use the un-minified version
[05:54:58] <Angelos_> yep, that might be the issue, I will try the un minified version
[05:55:42] <LordThumper> Hi
[05:56:47] <LordThumper> Is there any way to capture on which <option> in a <select> a user is hovering on?
[05:57:40] <Innocentus> Can I somehow create a jquery html template which can be reused over and over for async requested data?
[05:57:48] <Defusal> bleh this is taking too long
[05:57:51] <Defusal> im not a designer -.-
[05:58:24] <Angelos_> I put the unminified ver in, and it's still not working. I works on the remove version on a stand-alone file www.pricklypearmedia.com is still has broken jquery on the top
[05:59:23] <Angelos_> when u said uniminified did u mean the jquery library unminified too?
[06:05:42] <sorush20> hi again.. what is the problem on this page. When I click on register or login .. I don't see the login form.. www.sorushnazari.com/tiempolatinolondres
[06:08:52] <Innocentus> QUESTION: Is there an efficient way to async load data with jquery for an endless list?
[06:10:03] <Woet> Innocentus: what is no efficient about the basic async ajax call
[06:10:05] <Woet> + ?
[06:10:50] <rroelofs> sorush20: you have an error.  open your console and you will see it
[06:13:56] <Innocentus> Woet: it should only load new data when the user is scrolling
[06:14:03] <Innocentus> Woet: there is no plugin for this?
[06:14:05] <Woet> Innocentus: yes, I got that
[06:14:16] <Woet> Innocentus: sure, there are many
[06:14:49] <Innocentus> is there also one for moving one LI to another list?
[06:15:05] <Woet> Innocentus: I have no idea, why do you need a plugin for such a simple thing?
[06:15:20] <Innocentus> Woet: a move-animation
[06:15:27] <Woet> Innocentus: sure, jquery-ui
[06:15:36] <Innocentus> Woet: animation also?
[06:15:44] <Innocentus> Woet: I don't want that the user drags it - it should move by itself
[06:15:47] <e-anima> hi. i am doing some value copy from one input to another, it works for .change .keyup etc. problem is that firefox has some history field appearing on inputs, if the user clicks something from that its not copied. is there an event to react on this?
[06:16:03] <e-anima> i mean what event would trigger
[06:16:16] <LordThumper> Is there any event fired when the user hovers over the <option> elements in an open <select> ?
[06:16:42] <Woet> Innocentus: sure, jquery-ui
[06:16:52] <Woet> Innocentus: did your country block google and the jquery docs or something?
[06:17:20] <e-anima> LordThumper, http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[06:17:24] <e-anima> i think thats all events
[06:17:36] <e-anima> there is a .hover()
[06:17:43] <Innocentus> Woet: I was on their page, but there was only the feature to drag and drop it by hand
[06:17:50] <Innocentus> Woet: I want an animation
[06:18:01] <Innocentus> Woet: can you give me a link to the animation example?
[06:18:01] <Woet> Innocentus: time to open your eyes then
[06:18:09] <Woet> Innocentus: no, but Google can.
[06:18:24] <Angelos_> hi
[06:18:42] <Angelos_> still not managed to fix the jquery issue on pricklypearmedia.com
[06:18:48] <Angelos_> It won't work :(
[06:19:14] <e-anima> i found this but, is that the only way: http://lab.atworkinthecloud.com/form-history-select/
[06:19:20] <Angelos_> I get ajaxurl is not defined, and sexy slider is not a function
[06:31:11] <Xotix> How can i get the source of an external page?
[06:31:32] <Angelos_> Ctrl +  U?
[06:33:43] <Defusal> anyone feel helpful?
[06:34:07] <crem> Is it possible to query a CSS rule with jQuery? What I need is for example know what background-color would <div class="blah"> have. Is it possible without inserting div into DOM tree? (And ideally without creating div node at all)
[06:35:07] <bartmax> crem i think it
[06:35:12] <bartmax> it's possible
[06:35:12] <Slydder> hey all. I am trying to pass a dynamically generated array of checkbox values through jquery.post how would I do that? a nor .val() is not working. it only sends 1 value from the array to the script.
[06:35:15] <bartmax> ?css
[06:35:15] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[06:35:26] <Defusal> bleh, i've wasted far too much time on this already
[06:35:31] <bartmax> $('.blah').css('background-color');
[06:35:42] <Defusal> now i just feel annoyed after wasting so much time and still not having something i can use
[06:35:56] <bartmax> Defusal: which problem ?
[06:35:57] <rroelofs> bartmax: that only works on elements in the dom
[06:36:17] <bartmax> rroelofs: i see...
[06:36:43] <bartmax> then i think you need a css parser
[06:36:45] <bartmax> or something like that
[06:36:49] <zolek> hi, can i achieve access with .children() or sth similar only to the first level children of element? I need UL -> LI's but no UL -> LI -> UL -> LI's to get in a function
[06:37:40] <rroelofs> crem:  you can get what you want, but you will have too google for it.  look for css rule
[06:37:48] <bartmax> crem: http://glazman.org/JSCSSP/
[06:38:05] <crem> thanks, will look into it
[06:38:13] <bartmax> zolek: yes, $('ul > li');
[06:38:54] <crem> CSS parser is a bit overkill.. just trying to eleminate some duplication between CSS and JS.
[06:39:16] <xrated> join #phpc
[06:39:23] <xrated> fail
[06:39:41] <zolek> bartmax, thx, but i actually gave 'em a class="levelOne" x)
[06:39:51] <Defusal_> ok, now im super pissed.. cant think of a worse time for a blue screen :|
[06:40:15] <bartmax> zolek: ok
[06:40:27] <bartmax> Defusal: go run a mile
[06:40:29] <Innocentus> Woet: ok, I found this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[06:40:34] <Innocentus> Woet: but how to animate?
[06:40:46] <Innocentus> Woet: the user shouldn't drag and drop by himself but it should animate itself?
[06:40:59] <Woet> Innocentus: your country not only blocks google and the jquery docs but it even blocks you from trying out things?
[06:41:06] <Woet> that's messed up
[06:41:13] <ravenzz> how can I remove empty values from an array?
[06:41:35] <ravenzz> filter(function(){ return this !== '' }) ?
[06:41:47] <Defusal> and i lost all my open tabs
[06:41:48] <Defusal> bleh
[06:41:56] <Defusal> bartmax, definitely dont have time for that
[06:43:00] <Innocentus> Woet: there is no animation method in the method list, so how can I animate it then?
[06:43:13] <Woet> Innocentus: i'm trying to give you hints here
[06:43:45] <tocka> Hey guys, i have this code which transforms an input to an upload field, but I need to modify it (somehow..) that it would support lets say 5 different input fields on the same page
[06:43:46] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/SGg9Pc4G
[06:43:53] <tocka> Any ideas how to do that?
[06:45:04] <tocka> Or should I just copy and paste the code like 5 times and thats it?
[06:46:21] <zfmf> autocomplete results are not visible anyone an idea whats wrong here : http://pastebin.com/fBWrV4UC
[06:47:16] <Xotix> Angelos, i meant with jquery. BUt i got it
[06:47:25] <Angelos_> hi
[06:47:36] <Angelos_> tell me, I've been trying for ages
[06:47:39] <nFFF> ravenzz, yea you can just use the native filter function
[06:48:00] <Defusal> since i could not find any direct replacement for jquery ui button icons to provide an animated spinner, i tried converting a pure css and html version to a javascript and css version (by changing the class on interval), but this failed anyway, and even if it had worked, it would not be a smooth animation
[06:48:01] <Xotix> Angelos, are you talking to me? Use the name pls
[06:48:01] <Defusal> so i give up
[06:48:20] <Defusal> i will just replace the button text with "loading..." and that will have to be good enough :(
[06:48:22] <Angelos_> Xotix > How did you do it?
[06:48:44] <Angelos_> Xotix > My version is still broken :(
[06:48:48] <Defusal> i still cannot believe there is no out of the box jquery ui button icon spinner loader indicator solution
[06:48:53] <ravenzz> nFFF that's what I tought the code I have pasted is not working
[06:49:35] <Xotix> Angelos, getting html of a external page?
[06:49:39] <Innocentus> Woet: any hints for me? :/ :(
[06:49:51] <ravenzz> I split an url, using / as delimiter..but I need to handle both the urls with an ending / an the ones without it
[06:50:04] <Angelos_> Xotix > we got our wires crossed
[06:50:17] <Xotix> Angelos probably
[06:51:57] <Angelos_> My jQuery is not working @ pricklypearmedia.com
[06:52:06] <Angelos_> The top sexy slider does not work still :(
[06:53:59] <xh> please excuse my noobness, but how can i move an absolutely positioned div to the right e.g. by 100px? looking at .position() and .offset()  but still can't figure out a how to use them
[06:54:45] <bartmax> xh: i think .position({right:100})
[06:54:48] <bartmax> ?position
[06:54:48] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[06:55:03] <nFFF> ravenzz, try reutnring true
[06:55:04] <bartmax> ?offset <--
[06:55:09] <bartmax> ?offset
[06:55:12] <nFFF> filter(function(){ return true });
[06:55:16] <bot-t> bartmax, Offset behavior in I.E. - jQuery Forum - http://forum.jquery.com/topic/offset-behavior-in-i-e
[06:55:17] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[06:55:24] <xh> bartmax: would that set it or increment it?
[06:55:34] <ravenzz> nFFF solved. filter(function(foo) { return !!foo })
[06:55:43] <bartmax> xh: i think i would set it
[06:56:06] <nFFF> yea yu can just return true
[06:56:31] <ravenzz> let me try that
[06:56:49] <xh> bartmax: i see, thanks
[06:57:28] <ravenzz> nFFF uhm no it doesn't work
[06:57:52] <Whirl3d> Good morning. I would like to get some advice about site navigation using hashchange events. I have my content in your basic heirarchy:  Section-page-article-topic   sections have multiple pages, pages have multiple articles, etc.
[06:57:52] <JoeyCadle> var d = $('div'); $('div').css('left',d.position.left+20+'px'); should work.
[06:58:57] <JoeyCadle> but if it's absolute positioned u should know where it's positioned to start and just increment the number by 10px. For instance if your css declares that it's at top: 0; left: 0; just to $.css('left','10px');
[06:58:58] <nFFF> ravenzz, wierd works for me
[06:58:58] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/ggpfT/
[06:59:09] <Whirl3d> and I'm going to use the super simple hash schema of section-page-article-topic (instead of something like ?section="sectionName", etc. in the hash
[07:00:01] <ravenzz> nFFF http://jsfiddle.net/ggpfT/1/
[07:00:55] <Whirl3d> but my question is, when I go to manage a link to a different section, page, article....in which order should I break down the hash? Should I send it to the articleHandler that determines that it's page isn't loaded, so it cascades up until each relative parent is loaded..or the other way down?
[07:02:33] <nFFF> ravenzz, wierd it works for numbers
[07:03:29] <ravenzz> maybe because you have undefined / null values instead of empty strings
[07:03:36] <nFFF> Perhaps becuase of null values
[07:03:37] <nFFF> yea
[07:04:21] <nFFF> function(x){ !!x } is elegent enough
[07:05:31] <ravenzz> yep if the last element of the array is not 0
[07:05:38] <ravenzz> which is my case
[07:05:58] <ravenzz> otherwise function(x) { return x!='' }
[07:06:24] <Whirl3d> JoeyCadle, I think you can even do $("div").css({left:"+=20px"}) and jquery will do the math for you...
[07:07:05] <Xotix> var pics = $(data).find('img').attr('src');   console.log(pics); why does this create get calls?
[07:08:06] <ravenzz> now. is there a way to know what events are binded to a specific element?
[07:08:13] <tocka> Hey guys, i have this code which transforms an input to an upload field, but I need to modify it (somehow..) that it would support lets say 5 different input fields on the same page
[07:08:17] <ravenzz> eg throught the chrome dev tools
[07:08:21] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/SGg9Pc4G
[07:08:45] <nFFF> ravenzz, I think .data(events) may work
[07:09:11] <bjensen> Any recommendations for plugins providing masked input? My google search and only find stuff from 2007 and before…
[07:12:22] <anli_> Does it make sense to have both position: absolute and relative?
[07:12:28] <anli_> On one and the same div
[07:12:40] <nFFF> ?
[07:13:25] <nFFF> I don't know if Im misunderstanding your problem/question anli_, or your misunderstanding basic css
[07:13:41] <natte|wrk> hello
[07:14:08] <natte|wrk> any ideas how to swap two DOM elements (li elements inside an ul to be more specific)
[07:14:18] <nFFF> ?swap
[07:14:21] <bot-t> nFFF, #10754 (have jQuery.swap return the return of the callback instead ... - Opened 4 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10754
[07:14:25] <Flo0815> someone knows if a callback of $.animate is executed when the animation is stopped by $.stop()?
[07:14:49] <natte|wrk> ideally without cloning or using html(), would like to keep my bindings etc.
[07:15:43] <ravenzz> uhm
[07:15:49] <Xotix> with $(data).find('img') im getting 3 img's now i want an array of thir src paths. How do i do that? attr(src) gives me  string for just the first image and then 2 get request's which fail...
[07:15:56] <ravenzz> nFFF no way
[07:16:15] <Whirl3d> Xotix, you need .map
[07:16:26] <nFFF> ravenzz?
[07:16:37] <Xotix> Whirl3d: thanks i'll check it out
[07:16:45] <ravenzz> nFFF it is not working, or I am doing something wrong
[07:16:45] <LittleFoot> hi what gives invalid json error?
[07:16:47] <Whirl3d> $(sel).find("img").map(function () {return ($(this).attr("src")');})
[07:17:13] <Flo0815> LittleFoot: u need to specify ur question
[07:17:17] <Xotix> Whirl3d: … okay thanks
[07:17:22] <Whirl3d> LittleFoot, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say...invalid JSON?
[07:17:25] <LittleFoot> i need to help some1
[07:17:30] <Flo0815> Whirl3d: lol
[07:17:43] <LittleFoot> they telling me they get invalid json error
[07:17:50] <LittleFoot> wth is giving them that
[07:17:56] <LittleFoot> js ?
[07:17:58] <LittleFoot> php?
[07:18:00] <Flo0815> LittleFoot: thats like u ask: what causes war?
[07:18:13] <nFFF> ravenzz, you might have to google it, Im not 100% sure just a small inkling
[07:18:21] <ravenzz> nFFF I want to know what function is binded when a tweet is expanded, so I can bind the same function to an element I add thorugh
[07:18:26] <Whirl3d> Flo815, that's better than mine: I usually ask how long is a piece of string...
[07:18:31] <natte|wrk> nFFF: the link from ?swap seems to be about swapping in/out css properties
[07:18:32] <ravenzz> you could try it yourself then
[07:18:36] <nFFF> $('.foo').data('events'); // I thought that would show binded events
[07:18:49] <Flo0815> Whirl3d: i'm getting creative :)
[07:18:57] <nFFF> natte|wrk, yea sorry presumed there might be a swap method
[07:19:21] <nFFF> You tru $('.foo').after($('.bar')); // this is a guess, might now work
[07:19:26] <nFFF> Could try*
[07:19:31] <Whirl3d> nattelwrk, use detach and append
[07:19:42] <Whirl3d> they will keep your bindings in tact, I believe
[07:19:52] <Flo0815> anyway, someone a answer for my question? (someone knows if a callback of $.animate is executed when the animation is stopped by $.stop()?)
[07:20:01] <Xotix> Whirl3d: seems to work. I'm also getting the soruce of an page with post() and this causes some get errors because he tries to load the img's and builts up a wrong path (cross domani) can i somehow stop it from trying to get the images? Also, why did you put the return into braces?
[07:20:13] <natte|wrk> Whirl3d, nFFF thanks - I'll try both of those :)
[07:20:24] <Whirl3d> Not sure about the callback thing. I don't think it does, but it would be easy to check in a fiddle.
[07:20:44] <Flo0815> i need to prevent it, if it happens
[07:21:07] <nFFF> natte|wrk
[07:21:08] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/ggpfT/2/
[07:21:11] <nFFF> insertAfter works fine
[07:22:56] <Whirl3d> Xotix, force of habit with the return braces...8(  as for stopping the loading, on page ready,you can grab the imgs, put their intended (but incorrect) src attribute in their data object and set their src to ""
[07:23:02] <natte|wrk> works perfectly, thanks nFFF :)
[07:24:00] <Xotix> Whirl3d: I could, hmm, thanks.
[07:24:02] <Whirl3d> $("img").each(function () {var img=$(this); img.data("badSource",img.attr('src')).attr("src","");})
[07:24:19] <Xotix> yeah this is clear :)
[07:24:42] <nFFF> ravenzz
[07:24:53] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/ggpfT/3/
[07:24:56] <ravenzz> yes?
[07:25:05] <nFFF> check your object in console
[07:25:21] <ravenzz> uhm ok
[07:26:27] <ravenzz> so I should try it until I find the correct object I guess
[07:26:36] <thpickert> Has anyone heard anything about Yahoo WebAnalytics messing up click events on links?
[07:26:44] <Flo0815> can somebody plz tell me why this little fiddle is not working?!
[07:27:19] <Flo0815> http://jsfiddle.net/yvAS4/2/
[07:27:51] <nFFF> ravenzz
[07:27:52] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/ggpfT/4/
[07:27:56] <Flo0815> oh nvm...
[07:27:57] <nFFF> check your console
[07:28:04] <LittleFoot> ok i just made sure all the values in json r strings
[07:28:19] <LittleFoot> i think thats what is causing the invalid json string
[07:28:22] <LittleFoot> error
[07:28:39] <LittleFoot> they must be doing something retarded on their end
[07:28:46] <Whirl3d> so...it was invalid JSON, hrmmm
[07:30:12] <LittleFoot> its not invalid json tho
[07:30:19] <LittleFoot> numbers dont need to be quoted
[07:30:26] <LittleFoot> thats baloney
[07:31:08] <ravenzz> nFFF yep I trust you :p I was wondering to find a way to see that throught the chrome dev tools. i would be handy
[07:32:22] <ravenzz> oh it is bound not binded !? :P
[07:34:36] <ravenzz> nFFF I think I was correct http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/1372/tmpu.png
[07:35:34] <ravenzz> my guess is if you bind a click on window load, maybe it is not listed when you inspect the link
[07:36:35] <nFFF> Im confused
[07:36:50] <natte|wrk> nFFF: http://pastie.org/private/mhmyyeeoknohywdymz2wla
[07:37:07] <nFFF> you want it to show as a data attribute?
[07:37:39] <ravenzz> no I need to know what is executed when the user click on an element
[07:37:41] <natte|wrk> bubble sortish way of collapsing out the empty spaces in an ul > li of images, after deleting an img :)
[07:37:48] <ravenzz> nFFF do you have a twitter account?
[07:37:54] <LittleFoot> srsly guyz
[07:37:55] <nFFF> nope
[07:37:58] <LittleFoot> invalid json
[07:38:11] <LittleFoot> thats the best u kan do?!
[07:38:19] <ravenzz> ok
[07:38:20] <ravenzz> np
[07:39:23] <Whirl3d> more than I can do. Especially when someone feels entitled to help and doesn't give any code or details to help them with. It's like asking if it's the best you can do to solve my issue. But you don't even know my issue now do you? Hmmm?
[07:40:07] <LittleFoot> nono i m not dissing u guys lol
[07:40:18] <xmaddness> Yeah, screw those guys that try to help
[07:40:20] <LittleFoot> im dissing the person who is using my api
[07:40:45] <LittleFoot> al the json values were quoted before
[07:40:57] <LittleFoot> so i removed the quotes on the numberics
[07:41:10] <LittleFoot> so their code got all crunchy and upset
[07:41:58] <monk12> hey all, i saw a good plugin for only allowing alpha/alphanumeric/numeric chars but its depreciated and the replacement also doesnt handle international chars... just curious if anyone knows a good easy way to limit a textfield to alpha (including international chars)
[07:42:13] <Whirl3d> but man, we don't know anything about your code. You have given us NOTHING to help with other than to tell us your are getting invalid JSON as the result of changing out quotes on some numbers...
[07:42:15] <nFFF> ravenzz
[07:42:15] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/ggpfT/5/
[07:42:22] <nFFF> check your console

[07:42:51] <LittleFoot> how should i kno what their doing
[07:42:59] <LittleFoot> they are
[07:43:51] <LittleFoot> no other ppl r having these issues
[07:46:06] <Xotix> How do i  get json out of an obj?
[07:46:57] <nFFF> ravenzz, I think this is what you are trying to achieve? http://jsfiddle.net/ggpfT/6/ check your console and look at the first li
[07:49:31] <stalecache> anyone have a good list of web design/development conferences for 2012?
[07:50:05] <Xotix> stalecache: join a usergroup
[07:53:18] <sphinxxx> Xotix: can you explain a little more or show an example
[07:53:50] <MacroMan> Hi. I am trying to use .each but want a delay in between each iteration. Is that possible? Here is my current code: http://pastebin.com/QmwwXJ0u
[07:54:24] <nFFF> MacroMan, from within the each call setTimeout
[07:54:39] <Xotix> sphinxxx like a js obj -> json. opposite of parseJson(); :)
[07:55:09] <nFFF> setTimeout(function(){$(this).animate({ left: '0px' }, 300)}, 1000);
[07:55:44] <MacroMan> nFFF: Thanks I'll give it a try
[07:55:51] <Whirl3d> ugg or use .delay
[07:55:54] <sphinxxx> Xotix: var json_data = JSON.stringify(obj);
[07:56:12] <Xotix> sphinxxx:  thanks
[07:57:29] <MacroMan> nFFF: When I use that code I get this error: 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultView' of undefined'
[07:57:45] <MacroMan> I didn't have any errors before
[07:58:03] <Gates> i feel so dumb
[07:58:22] <Gates> i cannot figure out how to put a smoother transation on mouseout
[07:58:49] <sphinxxx> MacroMan: make a jsfiddle
[07:58:56] <Interface> http://pastie.org/private/j2wrormme934urpyebzonw
[07:58:58] <MacroMan> A what?
[07:59:04] <sphinxxx> ?demo
[07:59:04] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:59:19] <Interface> can anyone tell me why the selector in line 2 doesn't select the link in line 18?
[07:59:44] <Gates> sphinxxx: where would easing going on this, http://pastebin.com/XdaSASGD
[08:00:17] <sphinxxx> Gates: you're changing .attr,  you can't put easing on that
[08:00:49] <Gates> sphinxxx: than how could i make the image on hover not change so harsh
[08:01:24] <ravenzz> nFFF np man, I get rid of the link
[08:01:37] <sphinxxx> Gates: you'd basically have to fake it, make the img fade out a bit, and then fade back in after the img src change occurs
[08:01:52] <nFFF> ravenzz?
[08:01:56] <nFFF> Does it not do what you want?
[08:02:24] <Gates> sphinxxx: hmm im not at all sure how to do that
[08:02:35] <ravenzz> uhm in your last fiddle the console doen't show anything
[08:02:36] <sphinxxx> Gates: one sec
[08:03:00] <Gates> sphinxxx: kkay, heres what the we are going for, http://livedemo00.template-help.com/wordpress_38001/ - not sure if its helpful at all
[08:03:28] <MacroMan> http://jsfiddle.net/RbmCn/
[08:03:42] <nFFF> ravenzz, sec
[08:03:55] <nFFF> MacroMan http://jsfiddle.net/ggpfT/7/
[08:04:07] <ravenzz> np nFFF i don't need it anymore. So I wouldn't you to waste your time.
[08:04:22] <nFFF> it does show something though
[08:04:23] <ravenzz> we can talk about it later, just to satisfy our curiosity
[08:05:34] <MacroMan> nFFF: That anitmated all iterations after the settimeout
[08:05:44] <nFFF> ravenzz, do you not see this: http://i.imgur.com/AfRSL.png
[08:05:55] <MacroMan> nFFF: I want to animate one, then go onto the next iteration etc
[08:06:41] <ravenzz> oh yep
[08:06:57] <ravenzz> nFFF it is not in the console but on the dom inspector
[08:07:11] <nFFF> You can just log it to console instead?
[08:07:11] <ravenzz> I misunderstood you
[08:07:17] <ravenzz> yup
[08:08:12] <ravenzz> good one
[08:08:37] <ravenzz> anyway it won't work in this case http://jsfiddle.net/ggpfT/8/
[08:09:13] <ravenzz> which is not rare at all
[08:10:04] <sphinxxx> Gates:  here's the basics of it: http://jsfiddle.net/xGMdb/2/
[08:11:40] <nFFF> ravenzz, throw it inside ready not load
[08:12:16] <ravenzz> eheh it should work on 3rd party websites
[08:12:28] <ravenzz> but as I said I don't need it anympore
[08:12:40] <ravenzz> we could rely on the dev tools I guess
[08:16:29] <sorush20> hi why isn't the login regsiter page opening I've made the adjustments you recommend.
[08:16:39] <sorush20> www.sorushnazari.com/tiempolatinolondres
[08:17:52] <itatitat> guys
[08:17:52] <rroelofs> sorush20: you still have several javascript errors.  until you fix them, stuff just won't work
[08:18:04] <Gates> sphinxxx: thank you
[08:18:04] <itatitat> can I set the code of my HTML in JQuery in an external file?
[08:18:19] <Gates> sphinxxx: but now if u go across two image next to each other it breaks, augh
[08:18:30] <sorush20> rroelofs: where do you check the errors?
[08:18:45] <aaronmcadam> itatitat: do u mean javascript templating? look at handlebars.js
[08:19:00] <itatitat> nono, not templating
[08:19:15] <itatitat> I've only code to modify CSS by means of events
[08:19:21] <Gates> well thissucks
[08:19:31] <aaronmcadam> modify CSS?
[08:19:39] <itatitat> can I set that code in an external file?
[08:19:42] <aaronmcadam> you should be adding/removing classes, don't use $.fn.css
[08:19:43] <rroelofs> sorush20: your browser has a javascript console.  the errors will show there.  If you are using a good browser it will even tell you the correct line number
[08:23:35] <pandeiro> what is the logic behind passing in undefined as the second argument to an anonymous function wrapper?
[08:24:34] <xckpd7> can someone help me with this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9691782/how-to-destroy-jquery-validation-and-any-further-attempts-at-submission/9692168#9692168
[08:25:06] <xckpd7> I'm basically trying to surpress form submits.... I'm halfway there, but using the enter key to submit still works.... see the first answer for context
[08:25:49] <rroelofs> xckpd7: bind to the submit event and return false if you don't want it to fire
[08:25:58] <Xotix> xckpd7, why not use prependDefault?
[08:26:16] <xckpd7> rroelofs: see the link & first answer..... already doing that
[08:26:32] <Gates> sphinxxx: you still there, i got it working mostly but i know im doing something stupid and i thikn youll know a quick fix
[08:26:58] <rroelofs> xckpd7: if that were true, the enter key wouldn't submit the form
[08:27:08] <Interface> Can someone help me with my second function here? http://pastie.org/private/il6yfollowxrsussa8za
[08:27:21] <Interface> my unselecting function doesn't work, however it doesn't have any errors
[08:27:37] <xckpd7> rroelofs: you looked at the link, right? that works when clicking the form, but not pressing enter
[08:27:43] <Gates> var newsrc = $(this).find('img').attr('src').slice(0,-4) + "_hover.jpg";
[08:27:48] <Gates> is there a better way to get the image name
[08:27:54] <xckpd7> I'm using the code from the first answer....
[08:27:55] <Gates> and add _hover to the end of it?
[08:28:02] <sorush20> don't get it... I never used an error console before..
[08:28:10] <xckpd7> rroelofs: sorry, clicking the submit button
[08:28:25] <sphinxxx> Gates: can you show it to me in a jsfiddle
[08:29:02] <akahn> does jquery let you bind events to arbitrary objects or just the DOM
[08:29:14] <MacroMan> OK. I'm getting there. This does the firs one, but won't iterate over the next ones: http://jsfiddle.net/RbmCn/4/
[08:29:20] <MacroMan> Any ideas?
[08:30:24] <Gates> sphinxxx: http://jsfiddle.net/xGMdb/3/
[08:30:58] <Gates> sphinxxx: any idea where the code is for this hover slider thing, http://livedemo00.template-help.com/wordpress_38001/
[08:31:17] <rroelofs> xckpd7: I did.  My understanding is that you want to prevent double submits... right?  The bsolute simplest thing is to use .data() to mark the form as submitted and in your current submit handler refuse to do it again.  return false or preventDefault should do what you want.
[08:31:53] <sphinxxx> MacroMan: it's because of 'return false'
[08:32:19] <rroelofs> sorush20:  what browser are you using?
[08:32:22] <MacroMan> I put in return false because I don't want each iteration to run at the same time
[08:32:34] <MacroMan> I want there to be a delay to each iteration
[08:32:56] <MacroMan> So I've tried setTimer. Why does setTimer only run once?
[08:33:03] <Interface> Here, I've made a JS fiddle
[08:33:04] <Interface> http://jsfiddle.net/G8nLX/
[08:33:17] <Interface> when you click on physical the animation runs
[08:33:28] <Interface> however when you re-click it after it has finished to undo the animation it doesn't fire
[08:33:30] <xckpd7> rroelofs: basically with my plugin, I can pass a success object which will execute on submit... that code is what I"m having execute. So far, I've only been able to suppress clicks with that code, and not the enter keypress
[08:34:16] <MacroMan> Does my 'return false;' stop the timer?
[08:34:37] <sphinxxx> MacroMan: yes
[08:34:40] <sorush20> rroelofs: I'm in the console , I just don't know what to do .. I get the message el.set is not a function in mootool script.. am I supposed to edit the script?
[08:35:11] <MacroMan> sphinxx: Any idea how I can re-structure it to run each iteration with a delay?
[08:35:27] <rroelofs> xckpd7: the success code is too late.  you need to do it before the ajax call
[08:37:10] <Whirl3d> is = a valid character to use in id attributes?
[08:37:45] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html
[08:37:53] <johnkpaul> ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").
[08:38:26] <knickabocka> i run a hide(), how to run a show() after the hide() is finished
[08:38:27] <Whirl3d> Johnkpaul, you rock! Thanks as always.
[08:38:39] <johnkpaul> :) np
[08:38:58] <johnkpaul> in case you want more details though, once html5 is done....http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/html5-id-class
[08:42:37] <nFFF> MacroMan, do you want each <li> to roll out seperately
[08:42:39] <nFFF> or together?
[08:43:54] <Gates> sphinxxx: did u get hte fiddle?
[08:44:10] <MacroMan> nFFF: Yes
[08:44:19] <pandeiro> repeat: what is the logic behind passing in undefined as the second argument to an anonymous function wrapper? eg jquery begins (function(window, undefined) { ...
[08:44:23] <MacroMan> Each 500ms after the previous one
[08:44:45] <MacroMan> So the next animation starts half way through the first]
[08:45:22] <nFFF> k sec
[08:45:36] <nFFF> easy solution
[08:47:47] <natte|wrk> kind of sucks that there isn't a good event for "the user has maybe done entering data into that field" ;)
[08:47:57] <MacroMan> nFFF: Are you on to something?
[08:48:18] <natte|wrk> blur almost works, unless you are working with the last field of the form
[08:48:35] <natte|wrk> keydown/keyup is a bit overkill
[08:48:46] <natte|wrk> maybe keydown/keyup with a timer, hmm
[08:49:21] <sphinxxx> doing stuff based on time in javascript is hell
[08:49:42] <MacroMan> sphinxxx: +1
[08:49:44] <Xotix> hi
[08:50:22] <sphinxxx> Gates: so whats the problem with this?
[08:50:35] <Gates> it will had _hover twice soemtimes to the image
[08:50:39] <Gates> if u move your mouse across the top
[08:51:10] <natte|wrk> true, but trying to do field by field updates via ajax and enable the submit button when all fields have been filled and there is a stupid edge case with the last field
[08:51:46] <sphinxxx> Gates: mouse events can be a little buggy sometimes
[08:51:48] <natte|wrk> silly requirement being that the user might fall down the stairs and close the browser and their data should be saved without submitting ;)
[08:51:56] <sphinxxx> best thing to do is add some kind of check, if _hover exists already, don't try to add it
[08:52:22] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/K7sR54SA thsi gives me the error 	.	Uncaught TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON  why?
[08:52:56] <anli_> Has firefox stopped supporting setting window.status?
[08:52:58] <Manvaril> hello
[08:53:16] <xckpd7> would anybody know how to kill jQuery Validation once it has been instantiated? I keep trying to just do .unbind in the success object but it doesn't take effect immediately....
[08:53:42] <xckpd7> I need to stop all further form submits completley and absolutely once the form has submitted successfully
[08:53:49] <kibble> xckpd7: doesn't it fire on submit?  Can you avoid that?
[08:53:52] <nFFF> MacroMan http://jsfiddle.net/RbmCn/29/
[08:54:17] <nFFF> actually simplier vbersion: http://jsfiddle.net/RbmCn/30/
[08:54:33] <xckpd7> kibble: basically without any return false code, I can press enter (or click the submit button) and submit the form like 7 times before the form fades out... with my return false code, I'm still able to submit the form a couple more times
[08:55:08] <rroelofs> xckpd7: I added an answer to your stack overflow question with a sample code snipet.
[08:55:16] <kibble> xckpd7: to be honest I had more issues getting it to fire then the avoid it working
[08:55:58] <nFFF> MacroMan, actually not sure I was doing http://jsfiddle.net/RbmCn/32/ is the simplest :D
[08:56:06] <nFFF> the ternary was redundant
[08:56:17] <MacroMan> nFFF: That's perfect. Thank you very much
[08:56:21] <Manvaril> Hi I'm a n00b at jQuery and have been playing around with it a little the last couple days, pretty easy if you know other languages too
[08:56:32] <MacroMan> I'll keep this method handy for future projects too!
[08:56:47] <franklin56> is it possible to use .load() to pick a <div> along with another <div>  inside    i.e.   $("#info").load('property_info.html' + ' #thisbox' +  ' #thiscontent' );?
[08:56:50] <Manvaril> My problem is that I can't get a element to change after it does it's busines
[08:57:09] <anli_> Is there a way to check if a div can be scrolled up more?
[08:57:32] <nFFF> MacroMan, actually simplest is : http://jsfiddle.net/RbmCn/34/
[08:57:39] <johnkpaul> anli_: there is, you'll have to do some calculation between outerHeight and scrollTop
[08:57:41] <nFFF> if you wanted to be anal
[08:57:58] <m4xx> is it possible to add headers when using .load() to request data?
[08:58:08] <MacroMan> nFFF: Love it.
[08:58:19] <anli_> johnkpaul: Hm, maybe I can check if scrollTop changes when I increase it
[08:58:36] <johnkpaul> increase what?
[08:58:42] <anli_> scrollTop
[08:58:50] <xinef> I have 5 dropdownlists on a page and would like to append the selected value of each of them to an array.
[08:59:10] <xinef> Suggestions on how I would go about htat?
[08:59:12] <xinef> *that
[08:59:28] <johnkpaul> anli_: you probably don't need to actually mofidy anything
[08:59:42] <anli_> But I am anyway modifying so I can use that
[09:01:25] <nFFF> xinef, var arr = []; $('select').each(function(i,e) { arr[i] = $(this).val(); });
[09:01:46] <m4xx> or possibly just access the hxr object before send?
[09:02:36] <natte|wrk> ewww, but works http://pastie.org/3635646 ;)
[09:03:15] <mrHat> how do i get the text of a preceding element that has a class applied
[09:04:04] <nFFF> ?prev @ mrHat
[09:04:04] <bot-t> mrHat, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[09:04:51] <xec> ?prevUntil
[09:04:51] <bot-t> .prevUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all preceding siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/prevUntil/
[09:04:56] <mrHat> nFFF but that gets only the "immediately preceding sibling" not 3 elements away for example
[09:05:03] <xec> ?prevAll
[09:05:03] <bot-t> .prevAll([selector]): Get all preceding siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/
[09:05:08] <xec> one of these?
[09:05:19] <mrHat> heh
[09:05:37] <mrHat> gets all preceding siblings until the one im interested :)
[09:05:51] <mrHat> it dosent include the one i want
[09:05:58] <xec> .prevAll(".class") should do it?
[09:06:19] <mrHat> ya think?
[09:06:33] <xec> depending on what you want
[09:07:12] <xinef> nFFF, That doesn't work it gives me all items in the listboxes..
[09:07:26] <xinef> nFFF, I only want the currently selected one..
[09:08:06] <nFFF> xinef, var arr = []; $('select option:selected').each(function(i,e) { arr[i] = $(this).val(); });
[09:09:45] <johnkpaul> anli_: http://jsfiddle.net/ysnQE/
[09:09:51] <xinef> nFFF: thankyou!
[09:10:10] <johnkpaul> I was slightly bored, and wanted to know how to do it without actually changing the scroll
[09:10:44] <nFFF> johnkpaul, if you ever get really bored, I got some projects you can work on :DD
[09:11:11] <johnkpaul> haha, _really_ bored is something I haven't come by in years and years
[09:12:55] <franklin56> trying to load 2 elements from a file with this which of course doesn't work     $("#info").load('property_info.html' + ' #thisbox > #BCT10');  any ideas?
[09:13:33] <MacroMan> nFFF: Thanks for all your help. I've applied some easing and it's working perfectly.
[09:13:48] <nFFF> np gl with it
[09:14:02] <nFFF> franklin56
[09:14:46] <nFFF> $("#info").load('property_info.html #thisbox>#BCT10');
[09:15:23] <franklin56> thanks nFFF i'll give it a try
[09:15:27] <Innocentus> I want to select all elements with class "test" in a element with ID "x" - I tried: $('#x').children('.test') - but it doesn't select anything :(
[09:15:27] <xec> umm
[09:15:34] <nFFF> $("#info").load('property_info.html #BCT10');
[09:15:41] <nFFF> sorry^^*
[09:16:02] <nFFF> you don't need your parent>child selector as its IDs
[09:16:05] <aqeel> any got ie6....original installed not emulation or anything?
[09:16:06] <Innocentus> the reasons for this could be that the elements with class 'test' are nested deep inside of element 'x' and I guess, the children selector only the selects the direct children
[09:16:29] <Innocentus> is there also a children-selector which also selects nested children?
[09:16:38] <aqeel> i got tried on xp with emulation and windows 7 with emulation shows different results?
[09:16:41] <Innocentus> aqeel: you can install it, what OS?
[09:16:47] <aqeel> windows?
[09:16:53] <Innocentus> aqeel: why so complicated? just install the free IETester - and you are fine
[09:17:12] <Innocentus> aqeel: you can test all IE-Versions, even IE 5.5 - and it works also on Windows 7 x64
[09:17:14] <aqeel> i did different output...
[09:17:16] <xec> ?find @ Innocentus
[09:17:16] <bot-t> Innocentus, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[09:17:37] <johnkpaul> aqeel: MS gives out VMS for free with all of their old ie versions preinstalled
[09:17:53] <aqeel> because of that got installed microsoft expression studio
[09:18:04] <aqeel> also shows differetn output...
[09:18:08] <franklin56> nFFF I'd also like the outside <div> formatting to show up also
[09:18:27] <johnkpaul> aqeel: if you have windows - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/02/04/testing-multiple-versions-of-ie-on-one-pc.aspx
[09:18:35] <johnkpaul> it's the real live version, not some emulation
[09:18:50] <johnkpaul> if you have osx there's https://github.com/xdissent/ievms
[09:18:57] <johnkpaul> which are the same virutal pc images ported over the virutalbox
[09:19:02] <Innocentus> johnkpaul / aqeel: http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage - and no, it is not an emulation...
[09:19:16] <johnkpaul> if you have linux, I think you can use it too, but not with those instructions
[09:19:21] <johnkpaul> oh cool Innocentus, thanks for sharing
[09:19:43] <johnkpaul> although Innocentus, I think that is an emulation
[09:19:53] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: it uses the original dlls
[09:19:56] <johnkpaul> it just has the rendering and js engines
[09:20:02] <johnkpaul> oh I see
[09:20:03] <aqeel> i have ie tester installed....but different output....
[09:20:17] <johnkpaul> also, Innocentus, that page scares me
[09:20:17] <Innocentus> http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=7039
[09:20:25] <aqeel> can see this page......in xp and windows......jailbreak.webege.com
[09:20:34] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: how does it differ?
[09:20:53] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: the virutal pc images have an actual real install of ie6-8
[09:20:55] <aqeel> ie tester crashes often
[09:21:01] <johnkpaul> so you open intenret explorer
[09:21:03] <johnkpaul> not ietester
[09:21:05] <johnkpaul> it's the real app
[09:21:15] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: sounds cool - where can I pull it?
[09:21:25] <johnkpaul> did you check the previous links that I sent?
[09:21:30] <aqeel> yes
[09:21:41] <aqeel> even tetsing now....while chgatting
[09:21:50] <anli_> Isnt offsetTop the way of getting the y position of an element relative its parent?
[09:22:11] <johnkpaul> not to it's parent
[09:22:13] <johnkpaul> to it's offsetParent
[09:22:16] <johnkpaul> which are diffrent
[09:22:20] <anli_> ok
[09:22:35] <Innocentus> the problem is only, that those vms don't run after a specific date... -
[09:22:42] <anli_> seemed that attr('offsetTop') was undefined
[09:22:43] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: no, they just can't get updates
[09:22:51] <anli_> ...for a certain element
[09:23:00] <johnkpaul> which you won't need, because you're not going to get malware on them
[09:23:06] <johnkpaul> I've been using the same install for months
[09:23:14] <johnkpaul> anli_: offsetTop is not an attr
[09:23:16] <johnkpaul> so it should be undefined
[09:23:22] <anli_> oh
[09:23:28] <johnkpaul> ?offsetTop @anli_
[09:23:30] <bot-t> anli_, .offset() - Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[09:23:41] <johnkpaul> oh, right, in jquery it's .offset().top
[09:23:49] <anli_> I dont understand .offset, can it be used for both setting and getting?
[09:23:54] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: cool, because I still got that vm on my disc
[09:23:57] <aqeel> ietester works ok in xp but not in windows 7...
[09:24:38] <johnkpaul> anli_: it can be used for both, like .val()
[09:24:46] <johnkpaul> it will set the top and left css properties
[09:24:48] <aqeel> even in ie9....pressing f12 and chhosing ie6 agent does not mprovide proper results
[09:24:51] <johnkpaul> which might or might not do anything
[09:24:59] <NoiseEee> aqeel: get a proper ie debugging environment.  the MS supplied images etc are the best way for the most part
[09:25:02] <atxq> so after I load content using $.post, how can I access the content that I loaded?
[09:25:13] <NoiseEee> aqeel: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11575
[09:25:27] <aqeel> thanks noiseEee
[09:25:32] <johnkpaul> atxq: in your success callback
[09:25:33] <NoiseEee> aqeel: also fwiw http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/02/reliable-cross-browser-testing-part-1-internet-explorer/
[09:25:49] <johnkpaul> ?post @atxq
[09:25:50] <bot-t> atxq, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[09:25:58] <johnkpaul> see the third parameter there, that's where you put a function
[09:26:06] <johnkpaul> that function will take the one argument of the data that you just loaded
[09:27:38] <atxq> johnkpaul: I want to access the content way after it gets loaded. the jquery code that I want to use is already loaded on the same page, but does not access newly loaded content loaded by $.post()
[09:28:16] <atxq> johnkpaul: I tried .on() but I get undesirable results
[09:28:20] <johnkpaul> atxq: you need to process your data in the success callback
[09:28:30] <johnkpaul> the data is not available until after the ajax call has finisehd
[09:28:42] <atxq> that is the only way?
[09:29:06] <nights``> hmm
[09:29:11] <nights``> on a html select
[09:29:18] <nights``> how can i fire jquery after someone changes
[09:29:20] <nights``> the value
[09:29:25] <johnkpaul> ?change @nights``
[09:29:26] <bot-t> nights``, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[09:29:39] <nights``> oh thanks so much
[09:29:40] <johnkpaul> atxq: that is not the _only_ way, but it is probably the best advised way
[09:29:41] <nights``> man that was quick
[09:29:50] <johnkpaul> np nights``, I didn't do much, it was the bot :)
[09:30:11] <johnkpaul> atxq: what are you trying to do, can you show us your live code in a jsfiddle?
[09:30:14] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @atxq
[09:30:15] <bot-t> atxq, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[09:30:24] <atxq> johnkpaul: thanks, been working on this issue for about a week now.
[09:31:30] <atxq> johnkpaul: I am creating files using ajax php, and when I fetch the directory listing of files via $.post, I want to delete files from the list
[09:32:11] <aqeel> ok room so which vm should i go for
[09:32:23] <aqeel> microsoft vpc is no good
[09:32:55] <NoiseEee> aqeel: pretty sure its necessary if you want to use those VMs
[09:33:25] <aqeel> guess no choice...thanks
[09:33:26] <johnkpaul> atxq: why is vpc no good?
[09:33:32] <johnkpaul> sorry, that was for aqeel
[09:33:41] <johnkpaul> atxq: so in your callback, you can delete the items from the list
[09:33:46] <johnkpaul> ?remove @atxq
[09:33:47] <bot-t> atxq, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[09:36:25] <atxq> johnkpaul: thanks for the help
[09:36:44] <aqeel> Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 1.0 ...................to confirm...this is the latets right
[09:41:19] <johnkpaul> atxq: no problem
[09:41:21] <aqeel> with vpc do i need to install xp mode or can i just run the ie6 directly into vpc
[09:41:50] <atxq> so is it correct to put a ajax function inside a ajax callback?
[09:42:11] <Jesdisciple> you mean a call to $.ajax?
[09:42:23] <Jesdisciple> it's fine
[09:42:31] <xec> atxq: it sounds like a silly idea, but... you can do that if you want :p
[09:42:48] <atxq> $.post("",{},function(){ $.post() }); ?
[09:42:49] <xec> question is why, i guess
[09:43:31] <xec> what are you doing with this
[09:43:45] <nFFF> Im guessing hes trying to make them synchronous
[09:43:52] <atxq> I want to be able to send data that I loaded using $.post() back to the server to further processing
[09:44:21] <atxq> makes sense?
[09:44:46] <xec> atxq: sounds like this is something the server should be able to do with one request
[09:44:59] <NoiseEee> atxq: yeah i mean the backend knows what its sending back that first time....
[09:45:04] <NoiseEee> atxq: so why request it again?
[09:45:37] <NoiseEee> $backend->doSomething(); $backend->doNextThing();  return $response   kind of thing
[09:45:50] <atxq> but on the first request, the data for the second request is not known until I click on the data from the first request
[09:46:16] <Jesdisciple> because you need to combine the first response with client data?
[09:46:53] <aqeel> thanks......setting this xpmode and vpc up now....be back after setup....
[09:47:07] <Jesdisciple> maybe you should send the client data in the first request so the server knows the final thing you need
[09:47:17] <atxq> so I load data <li> with $.post. how can I initiate another $.post when the <li> data is clicked on?
[09:47:39] <kibble> atxq: attach a click event to by id or class
[09:47:56] <Jesdisciple> $li.click(f); where f is an onclick callback
[09:48:39] <atxq> jquery does not delete the id of the loaded data, and since there are many <li> items, makes sense to use $(this) instead
[09:49:13] <Jesdisciple> doesn't really matter how you get it, except that yes that's more efficient
[09:50:38] <atxq> so the best solution is placing a $.post inside a $.post callback?
[09:52:00] <Jesdisciple> I would guess not
[09:52:02] <Manvaril> Can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/LpwU2/4/
[09:52:23] <atxq> my only issue is finding a practical way to access the data loaded by $.post without using the callback
[09:52:28] <Jesdisciple> I would propose that the logic you need to do to determine what to request next should be on the server instead
[09:52:54] <Jesdisciple> send the stuff that makes you know what to request to the server to let it know how to respond instead
[09:52:59] <juha-> if we took every elephant in the world and laid them end to end into space.. they would all die
[09:53:01] <Jesdisciple> so it only needs to respond once
[09:53:05] <kristofer91> Hey guys,
[09:53:13] <atxq> maybe I should be using $.ajax instead?
[09:53:15] <kristofer91> This function is making my theme options, and Nextgen gallery bug
[09:53:16] <kristofer91> jQuery(".custom_repeatable").sortable is not a function
[09:53:29] <kristofer91> when i remove it, it fixes everything
[09:53:57] <Deiu> Hello!
[09:54:05] <xmaddness> oh hai!~
[09:54:39] <Deiu> Is there a way to have jquery fetch a list of URIs in the background and then pass the contents to a processing function? (PHP, ruby, whatever)
[09:55:00] <Jesdisciple> atxq: $.ajax() is called by $.post()
[09:55:02] <atxq> the situation requires that I respond twice using ajax. 1) load the data with ajax, 2) delete the data when it is clicked on using ajax.
[09:55:07] <Jesdisciple> it's the same thing
[09:55:39] <Jesdisciple> atxq: then set the click handler or otherwise inform the click handler of the new state
[09:55:40] <atxq> I known they are similiar, by $.ajax has .complete, etc...
[09:56:31] <atxq> how do I set the click handler or inform of the new state? I guess this would be my question?
[09:56:39] <Deiu> Anyone? :)
[09:57:09] <nFFF> Deiu, sure, using AJAX
[09:57:20] <SpoonKing> Ki has anyone come across a Ie8 bug, " Object doesn't support property or method 'observe' "
[09:57:28] <nFFF> ?ajax @ Deiu
[09:57:28] <bot-t> Deiu, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:57:31] <Deiu> Quick example: let's say I have 10 atom feeds, I want to load the 1st one and display it, then load the rest in the background and display them once they load.
[09:57:33] <atxq> maybe I should be setting classes on the elements before calling $.post
[09:58:22] <nFFF> Deiu, not sure I fully folloow: but you could load the feeds to hidden elements
[09:58:44] <Deiu> The thing is, I want to do some processing on the retrieved documents
[09:58:50] <Jesdisciple> atxq: it's hard to say anything more specific without code
[09:58:51] <Deiu> before displaying them, that is.
[09:58:59] <Zzaichik> preload
[09:59:27] <Deiu> and not necessarily do the processing in javascript
[10:00:21] <Manvaril> Can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/LpwU2/4/
[10:01:12] <atxq> let me play with the $.post callback a little first, and if I cannot resolve it, maybe I can paste the code and get some help afterwards
[10:01:13] <AdvoWork> if i have a select menu, how would i set its selected option based on the id?
[10:01:24] <AdvoWork> so i want to make it selected for the option with id 10
[10:02:35] <nFFF> AdvoWork $('select').val($(select option#10'));
[10:02:46] <Manvaril> go to the <option> tag and put in <option selected='selected'>
[10:02:59] <quicksilver> Manvaril: well obviouslly I can't test it because of the ajax
[10:03:16] <quicksilver> Manvaril: but the first thing I spot is that  $(this).parent("visbut_hide") should be  $(this).parent(".visbut_hide")
[10:03:39] <quicksilver> Manvaril: (same with visbut_show)
[10:04:03] <Manvaril> k
[10:04:20] <quicksilver> Manvaril: rather than replacing entire spans why not just alter the image by selecting the img tag and doing .attr('src','../images/show.gif') ?
[10:05:05] <quicksilver> alternatively, keep two buttongs always prsent and hide/show the spans rather than replacing them.
[10:05:16] <quicksilver> otherwise you have to replace the handlers
[10:05:36] <quicksilver> (you could solve that part of it by using .on instead of .click, but it still seems simpler to me)
[10:06:05] <Manvaril> I have to change the whole span so I can put the info for the show button in there so if they change there mind they can just click the button again
[10:06:09] <AdvoWork> nFFF, that didn't seem to work, what am I doing wrong, i did: $('#delivery_address').val($('#delivery_address option#'+data.delivery_address_id));  where data.delivery_address_id is 1. my option is: <option id="1" data-special_instructions="No Special Instructions">ML</option> but it didn't seem to set it
[10:07:46] <nFFF> .text() or .val()
[10:07:53] <nFFF> I missed it off mein bad
[10:08:01] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: it's technically invalid to use numbers for IDs, won't work in all browsers i believe.
[10:08:17] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: I doubt you need your options to have unique IDs, why not refer to them by value?
[10:08:35] <nFFF> $('#delivery_address').val($('#delivery_address option#'+data.delivery_address_id).text()); or  $('#delivery_address').val($('#delivery_address option#'+data.delivery_address_id).val());
[10:09:24] <nFFF> although val will return the value attribute iirc
[10:09:34] <nFFF> so you gotsta be careful with option
[10:09:40] <nFFF> maybe text() will be more robust
[10:10:39] <nFFF> actually ignore that, just checked fidddle, .val() works fine
[10:11:24] <AdvoWork> nFFF, it works for one of them, but not both for some reason, my option is definately there id="1"  and my data.whatever is 1, but it's not setting it. the other it is though
[10:11:56] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: you have two options on the same page with ID 1?
[10:11:59] <nFFF> you expect to set both with one variable?
[10:12:17] <nFFF> one ID*
[10:13:26] <AdvoWork> there is def only one element with the id delivery_address on that page
[10:13:45] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: no, the ID "1"
[10:13:50] <quicksilver> I'm talking about the ID "1"
[10:13:55] <quicksilver> which I continue to suggest you do not use.
[10:14:14] <improwizacja> quiscksilver hi
[10:14:20] <Manvaril> err
[10:14:38] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, yeah i'm going to change it, but isn't that going based on the element (being the select, and *its* option 1?
[10:14:50] <quicksilver> ID is global.
[10:14:50] <Manvaril> if all the code works why doesn't my replaceWith( work
[10:14:56] <quicksilver> You cannot have two things on the same page with ID 1.
[10:15:05] <quicksilver> Which is why I asked "you have two options on the same page with ID 1"
[10:15:06] <quicksilver> ?
[10:15:59] <quicksilver> if you have a way to get the right <option> then it may be easier to use .attr('selected','selected')
[10:16:18] <quicksilver> but either way you can't have two elements with the same ID on the same page, and you shouldn't use numbers as IDs.
[10:17:08] <improwizacja> sory i interapt I need good functions mapping a oval motion there is someting in JQuery or i JavaScript THX for all help
[10:17:28] <improwizacja> quicksilver hello
[10:17:56] <improwizacja> interrupt
[10:18:42] <improwizacja> hi culh
[10:27:32] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, i've basically got this: <option id="1" data-special_instructions="No Special Instructions">TEST</option>  and I have the text "TEST"  can I set the selected option based on that?
[10:27:52] <Manvaril> what is 'data-special_instructions'
[10:28:02] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: yes, and nFFF pretty much showed you how. However.
[10:28:10] <AdvoWork> Manvaril, a data attibute
[10:28:17] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: (a) are you using the ID 1 twice on the same page?
[10:28:17] <Guest43556> I really need help on a jquery snippet
[10:28:22] <quicksilver> because that won't work.
[10:28:27] <quicksilver> and it's a stupid choice of ID anyway.
[10:28:44] <quicksilver> (b) is there some good reason not to use the 'value' attribute?
[10:28:56] <Manvaril> why don't use use something like id='instruct-1'
[10:29:04] <Interface> Can anyone explain to me why when you click on physical twice it resizes back to it's size? http://jsfiddle.net/YBN2m/
[10:29:04] <Manvaril> add some words to it and then just take em out
[10:29:27] <Interface> my script is supposed to allow the user to select a choice
[10:29:29] <Interface> and hide the rest
[10:29:31] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, i know, i'm going to change it afterwards, BUT afaik/can see, no i'm not using the same id twice, and no theres no real reason for not using value attribute
[10:29:38] <Guest43556> I really need help on a jquery snippet
[10:29:39] <Guest43556> I really need help on a jquery snippet
[10:29:39] <Guest43556> I really need help on a jquery snippet
[10:29:41] <Interface> and when you click on it again it should go back to the default settings
[10:30:05] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: then use value, and you can do $("option[value=1]") which is much nicer.
[10:30:15] <kibble> quicksilver: so what I *think* I am getting here from you is using numbers for ID is not recommended :)
[10:30:18] <quicksilver> or set useful values like value="TEST"
[10:31:21] <AdvoWork> ok thanks for the help, will have a change around
[10:31:52] <quicksilver> once you have values you can use .val()
[10:32:07] <quicksilver> for example $('#id_of_select').val("TEST");
[10:32:14] <quicksilver> (if TEST is one of the value= attributes)
[10:32:25] <RandalSchwartz> generally a lot of IDs might indicate a somewhat broken design
[10:32:59] <quicksilver> actually I'm wrong
[10:33:07] <quicksilver> .val() is clever and works directly on the text of hte option
[10:33:08] <quicksilver> sorry.
[10:33:20] <quicksilver> see the "Example: Set a single select, a multiple select, checkboxes and a radio button" here:

[10:52:23] <Guest43556> hello?
[10:52:25] <nathanstaines> can someone please take a quick look at this and let me know if/how you could improve upon it? http://jsfiddle.net/aNSHQ/
[10:52:42] <Guest43556> can somebody please help me with some jquery or jquery UI
[10:54:48] <arlink> can firebug track a specific parameter?
[10:55:24] <jholloman> you can add a watch to a variable
[10:56:43] <jholloman> you'll have to do console.log to view a specific parameter, or step through the code
[10:57:06] <culh> I wanna do a quick function to restrict to N the number of chars to be inputed in a textarea. Can I simply use maxlength="N" and make a jq class that calls a function, or will some browsers ignore this tag?
[10:58:50] <nathanstaines> i've updated the jsfiddle so you can see what the JS is doing. http://jsfiddle.net/aNSHQ/3/
[11:01:24] <AdvoWork> hmm, if console.log(data) shows: Object aaData: Array[4] 0: Array[10] 0: 6  how do I access the number 6? I'm trying data.aaData[0][0] but fail
[11:01:40] <johnkpaul> culh: there are many jquery plugins to handle it for you
[11:02:05] <johnkpaul> if you mean that you want to add "maxlength" as an attribute, then yeah, you can do that, browsers will ignore it in terms of rendering and everything
[11:03:03] <AdvoWork> hmm data.aaData[0][0] worked after all
[11:03:09] <nathanstaines> anyone able to take a look at my JS and let me know if there's ways to impove it? http://jsfiddle.net/aNSHQ/3/

[11:12:35] <atxq> so I have a small issue when using .keydown().keyup(); currently it requires pressing the key twice to update. how can I fix this?
[11:13:31] <jholloman> can you setup a sample in jsfiddle?
[11:13:58] <alx-> i'm getting a "node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy" in firefox. no errors in chrome. https://gist.github.com/2139034
[11:16:04] <myrmyron> good evening
[11:17:43] <atxq> http://jsfiddle.net/Gg4HX/
[11:17:54] <tw2113> should jquery+ajax be able to send data to a php file that uses php's mail() function?
[11:18:19] <SmearCampaign> yes
[11:18:20] <atxq> trying to update html when key is clicked rather then pressing the key twice
[11:18:21] <jholloman> yes tw2
[11:18:26] <tw2113> just confirming
[11:18:35] <jholloman> taking a look atxq
[11:18:41] <kibble> alx-: without markup it's hard to judge but I would have to guess that the (data) coming back isn't correctly formatted
[11:18:43] <atxq> thanks
[11:18:44] <tw2113> ooh good part i missed
[11:19:00] <tw2113> should i be able to collect the data from a form and send that
[11:19:24] <kibble> tw2113: yes
[11:19:42] <tw2113> *fist pump*
[11:19:53] <jholloman> @atxq: http://jsfiddle.net/Cd4r4/1/
[11:19:55] <Woet> tw2113: to answer all your future questions: yes.
[11:19:57] <Woet> everything is possible.
[11:20:00] <jholloman> looks like you just need to use keyup instead of keydown
[11:20:00] <atxq> well, I just want to update the #html with the complete text from the input when keypressed
[11:20:11] <jholloman> the problem is at the time of keydown, there is no value yet in the box
[11:20:14] <tw2113> i ran out of questions other than the real use of QR codes
[11:20:26] <jholloman> but on keyup the typed key is in the box
[11:20:34] <tw2113> which i think is equivalent to human laser pointers the way cats react to them
[11:20:40] <alx-> kibble: here's the data that gets returned https://gist.github.com/2139143
[11:23:02] <initself> does this mean that find("input:image") is undef?
[11:23:03] <initself> pre.find("input:image").on is not a function
[11:24:38] <atxq> jholloman: but on my page when I append an $.post request on keyup, it takes time to update properly. can this be an issue with the server then?
[11:25:09] <kibble> alx-: can't see a problem there, therefore you'll have to excuse my lack of js understanding but "click(function() {})" doesn't look right to me.  I can't see that being the source of the error mind you
[11:26:44] <jholloman> atxq: not sure, possibly
[11:28:14] <jholloman> initself: wouldn't ("input:image") always be empty?
[11:28:22] <SwordArMor> Hello
[11:28:38] <jholloman> initself: i believe that selects all input types, then looks for all image types inside the first selection
[11:29:32] <SwordArMor> I try to have a sliding menu on my website: http://swordarmor.kappatau.eu/destrokhorne/
[11:29:40] <SwordArMor> It becomes sliding with the scroll of the page
[11:29:49] <SwordArMor> To do this, I use this code: http://swordarmor.kappatau.eu/destrokhorne/menu.js
[11:29:56] <SwordArMor> My problem is that the menu doesn't become sliding exactly when it's on the top of the page. There is a little distance before.
[11:30:02] <SwordArMor> This distance changes between pages and I don't know how to fix this bug.
[11:31:18] <initself> jholloman: but what if it doesn't find any and you try to run .on?
[11:31:38] <raj> is it slower selecting something with a data attribute than with its id/class?
[11:32:08] <jholloman> raj: not sure about data, but id is much faster than class
[11:32:20] <SwordArMor> I don't know
[11:32:28] <raj> oh, i interesting
[11:32:35] <raj> weird typo
[11:33:24] <jholloman> initself: i dont thinik it should error if it's an empty selection but I could be wrong, shouldn't it be on() not just on? I'm not familiar with that function
[11:33:37] <alx-> kibble: thanks for the help, ill keep trying
[11:35:04] <mistya> Hi guys! I have no idea how to use JS!
[11:35:15] <mistya> i wan't this effect in my website
[11:35:31] <mistya> http://moofx.mad4milk.net/
[11:35:40] <mistya> it's possible to do with jQuery?
[11:36:07] <mistya> (i'm talking about the draggable ball)
[11:36:17] <EyePulp> so is your mom.
[11:36:27] <raj> cool website http://jsperf.com/jquery-hasclass-vs-data-element/2
[11:36:28] <EyePulp> =P
[11:37:30] <SwordArMor> mistya : All is write in the page's sourcecode
[11:37:57] <SwordArMor> Line 145
[11:38:18] <tw2113> only issue being the site uses mootools instead of jquery
[11:38:20] <mistya> it's about a very  old mootools version.. with the actual version the code doesn't work
[11:39:01] <raj> how sick would jsfiddle be if you could also do this? http://jsperf.com/
[11:40:04] <Advocated> i've got a dialog to open on hover of an icon, this works well, i repeat the process from another icon, before i open the dialogs i close all dialogs, but if i open one, then the other, its showing the 2nd dialog underneath the other one and making the page scroll down?
[11:40:23] <mistya> the site talking about mootools 1.1 and actually we are at 1.45 version of mootools
[11:40:59] <mistya> ... jQuery don't have a similary effect?
[11:42:09] <tw2113> if it doesn't have a drag n drop plugin available, then it's just a matter of recreating
[11:42:16] <tw2113> may take some knowhow
[11:42:39] <tw2113> but since Mootools is javascript at the core anyway, it is possible with jquery, which is javascript at its core
[11:43:58] <mistya> So, doesn't exist a tutorial for the same effect on jQuery?
[11:45:06] <firekissed> Hi everyone, could some help me dealing with this issue : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9792341/jquery-ui-negative-margin-cut-div-on-effect
[11:45:35] <tw2113> none i know of personally
[11:47:47] <firekissed> Is there anyway to use blind effect with an orientated direction on left ? (the direction option are only vertical or horizontal which is not sufficient)
[11:49:09] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: We're heading back to the Bay Area! Announcing the 2012 San Francisco jQuery Conference! http://t.co/Q7wqn4VT http://t.co/hssGEXi8 ★ http://bit.ly/GBrUZ7
[11:50:11] <kibble> firekissed: do you mean a horizontal text sliding left or right?
[11:50:26] <firekissed> yep
[11:52:10] <firekissed> kibble how can i whisp you using web IRC ?
[11:53:21] <kibble> firekissed: it looks as if you can set the position top bottom left or right and I pressume if you say vert or horz it will go the correct direction
[11:53:37] <kibble> course I'm looking at the source code I don't see anything about in the docs
[11:54:37] <bt9> is there a way to add inline jquery code to an element that runs on doc ready?
[11:54:58] <bt9> (ie in an element's own event attribute)
[11:56:05] <kibble> bt9: as inside <input type='text' javascript:'somecode' />?
[11:56:20] <bt9> kibble: yes
[11:56:53] <kibble> bt9: pretty much no, at least not directly.
[11:57:02] <firekissed> kibble the only possible direction are horizontal and vertical, this is what the documentation is saying. Is there any other way to obtain the desired effect ? I've already tried to use left or right and it doesn't work
[11:57:12] <kibble> bt9: perhaps it would be better to explain what it is you are trying to accomplish
[11:57:46] <kibble> firekissed: the code seems to indicate if the position is right it will slide right rather than left which is I gather what you need
[11:58:36] <kibble> firekissed: of course I'm looking at the minified code so it's a bit hard to tell what it is looking for
[11:58:39] <bt9> kibble: I am using jquery blockUI plugin and a server side templating language to set the block on ready
[11:59:36] <bt9> kibble: the templating language does not play so well looping inside <script> tags so I wanted to put the js inside the html body (inline)
[11:59:59] <eddiemonge> synchronous behavior when using AJAX?
[12:00:05] <eddiemonge> why oh why?
[12:00:45] <kibble> bt9: can't you put it outside the element tags?
[12:01:07] <kibble> IE <div id='foo'><script>some code</script></div>
[12:02:03] <firekissed> I'm sorry kibble but which position are you talking about ? I'm talking about the "blind" effect. You found something usefull about it in the minified jqueryui source code ?
[12:03:03] <firekissed> oh your right
[12:03:05] <kibble> firekissed: looking at the non-minified code add's props for top bottom left and right but doesn't appear to use them
[12:03:44] <kibble> oh I see it uses them for the restore
[12:04:00] <bt9> kibble: didn't think of that :) will try now but can I do that without needing to put the code inside a document.ready?
[12:04:46] <kibble> bt9: you can put document ready code sprinkled anywhere in the markup
[12:04:49] <bt9> kibble: I have already implemented ready() in the header for other functions
[12:05:05] <eddiemonge> bt9 it sounds like maybe your code might not be optimal
[12:05:23] <kibble> bt9: you can put it at the bottom if you want, it won't run until the page is finished regardless where you put it
[12:06:56] <firekissed> I've got an old fix source code creating right and left options, but if I try to put in the minified jqueryui library it just make it crash :(
[12:07:08] <kibble> bt9: ready() doesn't have to but all lumped together you can put $(function({ some doc ready code });); $(function({ some more doc ready }););
[12:07:59] <bt9> kibble: thanks, reading that now, will try it out
[12:08:02] <kibble> firekissed: it simply calls jquery animate with some arguments, I'm not skilled enough to do all the stuff but it can't be that hard to figure something out, blind doesn't look that hard to figure out
[12:09:11] <kibble> bt9: the whole point of doc ready is that it won't act until the browser says has finished adding the html elements to the dom so javascript can work on them
[12:09:40] <firekissed> and what about this issue : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9792341/jquery-ui-negative-margin-cut-div-on-effect#comment12467803_9792341
[12:09:47] <kibble> in theory you can shoot out some html follow directly or even inline that attaches to the element(s) you've just created
[12:10:24] <kibble> but it's not always reliable
[12:16:01] <James13433> can anyone reccomend the Best jQuery slider with thumbnails? preferably lightweight.
[12:16:24] <eddiemonge> slider with thumbnails?
[12:16:25] <alexander__b> hi. a friend is using the mobile jquery stuff here: Logo
[12:16:35] <alexander__b> uhm... here: http://www.mettepernille.com/skole/portfolio/
[12:17:06] <James13433> yes eddie, so when you click the thumb it foes to the corresponding main image.
[12:17:08] <James13433> goes*
[12:17:08] <alexander__b> but when you click on "photography", it will not work until you refresh it first on certain browsers. anyone care to guess the problem?
[12:17:59] <alexander__b> i.e. you click the link - and it brings up a not fully loaded page of sorts. then you refresh, and suddenly it works. the page it brings up - http://www.mettepernille.com/skole/gallery2/ - works fine if you visit it directly.
[12:18:31] <eddiemonge> James13433: oh you mean a carousel of sorts
[12:18:47] <James13433> http://vupa-webdev.com/whitebox/index.php/ like this eddiemonge
[12:19:12] <James13433> (but better)
[12:19:40] <eddiemonge> alexander__b: thats using jqtouch, not jquery mobile stuff
[12:20:07] <alexander__b> eddiemonge: ohhh so they're not related?
[12:20:20] <eddiemonge> James13433: theres a ton of carousel plugins out there
[12:20:23] <eddiemonge> alexander__b: no
[12:20:56] <alexander__b> eddiemonge: oh. I just briefly read on it, and it said that it was a JQuery plugin.
[12:21:14] <eddiemonge> alexander__b: yes, its a jquery plugin. not its not jQuery Mobile
[12:21:25] <James13433> Yeah im sure I could find one, but I want a good one
[12:21:44] <alexander__b> eddiemonge: ah. OK. well. problem still persists, heh. thanks for the clarification.
[12:21:59] <eddiemonge> James13433: you are going to have to look at them and determine which one is good for you since there are a billion of them
[12:23:06] <eddiemonge> alexander__b: it looks like it hasnt bene touched in 2 months
[12:23:14] <alx-> how can i view the contents of [object XrayWrapper [object XMLDocument]] in the firefox console?
[12:23:17] <Hawkee> anybody know how to do this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9793510/positioning-a-jquery-ui-dialog-offset-from-the-center
[12:23:53] <eddiemonge> alexander__b: the issue appears to be it not transforming new pages when it loads them in
[12:24:13] <eddiemonge> alx-: console.log? try it in chrome?
[12:24:15] <kibble> Hawkee: it should accept css positions
[12:24:19] <alexander__b> eddiemonge: but the other links work
[12:24:29] <aro> hawkee
[12:24:37] <aro> are you the hawkee from back in my day
[12:24:40] <alx-> eddiemonge: it works in chrome, but my probelm is in firefox
[12:24:44] <Hawkee> I'm looking for an elegant solution that doesn't use a lot of css
[12:24:51] <Hawkee> aro, possibly
[12:24:56] <aro> undernet?
[12:25:02] <aro> 13 years ago or so
[12:25:14] <Hawkee> something like $('#dialog').dialog({position: center 70%});
[12:25:33] <Ender543> i have a nav bar that links to a page and then goes down to a menu bar that is collapsed in that page.  How do i make it so that when I click the link from the other page it brings me to that bar and opens it automatically?
[12:25:49] <Hawkee> aro, could very well be, I have a site that's the same as my namesake
[12:25:58] <aro> mirc script stuff?
[12:26:27] <kibble> Hawkee: it's positioned using css, that's how div's are placed, however in the position init for the dialog ("option", "position", "-70px") or something should work
[12:26:56] <eddiemonge> alexander__b: to the online version is broken as well
[12:28:38] <Ender543> how do I make a drop menu automatically drop when it is linked to from another page?
[12:28:51] <alexander__b> eddiemonge: aha.
[12:29:00] <kibble> Hawkee: also looks like the code's default init is to take into account the div's css position so you could use that
[12:29:20] <Hawkee> yes, that's mainly what I'm trying to figure out
[12:29:57] <Hawkee> I'm just looking for the specific syntax and solution for this specific request
[12:30:45] <Ender543> can someone help me with my problem please
[12:31:16] <wycks> anyone know how to get .droppable to use z-index or change the defualt behavior so the last element is always on top
[12:34:09] <jholloman> Ender543: you could try setting a parameter in the URL, then checking for that param on page load and drop the menu if the parameter is set
[12:34:47] <Ender543> ok that sounds like a good idea.  not really sure how to do that but ill play around
[12:35:35] <Ender543> could it be like: if web address = site#link than drop menu
[12:36:35] <neverbeenmaced> Whats up crowd! Does anyone know of a good example out there for using the Wikipedia API to get data from a wiki page and display it on your own site?
[12:36:54] <kibble> Hawkee: I happened to have a dialog I was fiddling with, tried what I suggested and I'm quite suprised it doesn't accept css positioning
[12:37:14] <Hawkee> yes, it's a bit more complicated than it seems
[12:37:17] <neverbeenmaced> I'm kind of a jquery noob so after reading a lot of docs i thought id just ask
[12:37:38] <Hawkee> I'm going to let my stackoverflow question stew for a bit and see what comes up
[12:37:51] <Hawkee> I keep telling myself I'm not going to get hung up on design things
[12:37:54] <Hawkee> need to focus on functionality
[12:38:09] <kibble> yeah always my problem to
[12:38:12] <neverbeenmaced> hehe i know that emotion so well Hawkee
[12:38:25] <kibble> but then we don't have a designer so it falls to us anyway
[12:38:29] <neverbeenmaced> :) it's like rearranging your sock drawer when you're bored.... css is sometimes :)
[12:38:39] <Hawkee> same here, it's just me doing both design and code
[12:38:49] <Hawkee> but I need to get the code out first
[12:38:55] <Hawkee> design is when everything is working properly
[12:39:01] <Vorspire> Hawkee what's the question?
[12:39:27] <Hawkee> Vorspire, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9793510/positioning-a-jquery-ui-dialog-offset-from-the-center
[12:40:06] <Ender543> jholloman i have a veriable in PHP "$page
[12:40:27] <Ender543> set up to detect hte page…what is my nxt step to set up a if statement using this php variable to affect my jscript
[12:41:12] <Ender543> er in other words…does this PHP variable work for my javascript later in the page?
[12:41:16] <Ender543> can i use it there?
[12:41:17] <kibble> Ender543: if($page == 'foo.php') echo '<script> some code </script>'
[12:41:34] <Ender543> k thx
[12:42:00] <kibble> Ender543: <html><input type=text value='<?php echo $page ?>' /></html>
[12:42:26] <kibble> depends what you expect it to contain and how you want to use it
[12:42:39] <Ender543> im gonna just use the first thing u said and i think that should be enough
[12:43:11] <Ender543> what should i encapsulate that if stament in? php tags?
[12:43:22] <secretrobotron> hey all. having some trouble with jquery-ui draggable auto-scroll
[12:43:30] <secretrobotron> anybody an expert?
[12:44:17] <codercube> secretrobotron: : just ask the question
[12:44:24] <secretrobotron> well, it's not working at all
[12:44:33] <secretrobotron> i just need to find out why and fix it
[12:44:42] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ secretrobotron
[12:44:42] <bot-t> secretrobotron, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:44:55] <Vorspire> Hawkee, can't you set the CSS on the dialog's source: position: absolute !Important; top: 30%;
[12:45:17] <Hawkee> Vorspire, I'll give that a try
[12:47:18] <Ender543> here is my script. is this correct jholloman  http://pastebin.com/hxkNRzHr
[12:49:46] <Hawkee> Vorspire, no go with that.  I tried addClass in the open method and it didn't affect the position
[12:49:54] <kibble> Ender543: not quite the way I would have done it but should work
[12:49:56] <Hawkee> I think it needs to be done with the position option when declaring the widget
[12:50:17] <Ender543> its not working for some reason
[12:50:55] <eddiemonge> Ender543: why are you even using js for that?
[12:51:11] <eddiemonge> why not have your php output the class directly to the element?
[12:51:12] <Ender543> well i borrowed code from my pulldown menu
[12:51:25] <Ender543> just took out the click function
[12:51:32] <Ender543> i wanted the link to be the click
[12:51:46] <Ender543> how do i do that eddiemonge
[12:52:39] <wycks> ""borrowed"
[12:52:39] <o-O-o> prop() attr() or data() ?
[12:52:54] <o-O-o> I am really confused about what to use...
[12:52:57] <eddiemonge> <div class="<?php echo $page1 == 'services.php#consulting' ? 'invisible' : 'notinvisible' ;?>">
[12:53:37] <eddiemonge> o-O-o: data for custom attributes or storing data. attr for things like href and stuff that doesnt change and prop for things that do change like checked or selected
[12:53:41] <Ender543> i see thx
[12:53:51] <o-O-o> I was happily using attr() until I've read the docs. :(
[12:54:03] <o-O-o> eddiemonge: hmm that makes sense, but shouldn't the attributes change too?
[12:54:08] <o-O-o> for example: width and height
[12:54:18] <o-O-o> or size (input type text)
[12:54:35] <o-O-o> or prop are USER props?
[12:54:41] <eddiemonge> width and height arent attributes. those should be css
[12:54:49] <o-O-o> eddiemonge: ok,. what about size?
[12:54:51] <eddiemonge> size doesnt really ever change
[12:55:02] <eddiemonge> ive never seen a need for it to change
[12:55:09] <eddiemonge> but that would be attr
[12:55:12] <o-O-o> but sometimes the need could appear
[12:55:17] <o-O-o> ok
[12:55:25] <o-O-o> so prop is for user input?
[12:55:34] <o-O-o> like checked or selected
[12:55:34] <Guest15785> is there a special way to handle/trap errors (i.e. 500, 404) from a $.post('/relative_link', {...post_data...}, function(data){}); call?
[12:56:01] <o-O-o> and what about this quote from the docs?
[12:56:02] <o-O-o> Additional Notes:      In Internet Explorer prior to version 9, using .prop() to set a DOM element property to anything other than a simple primitive value (number, string, or boolean) can cause memory leaks if the property is not removed (using .removeProp()) before the DOM element is removed from the document. To safely set values on DOM objects without memory leaks, use .data().
[12:56:37] <kibble> a bug in IE? I don't believe it
[12:56:59] <o-O-o> well, I still am using jquery to make my sites cross browser safe :)
[12:57:12] <o-O-o> so this quote worried me a bit
[12:57:16] <Hawkee> just broke 1,000 installs for my android app
[12:57:19] <Hawkee> slowly but surely
[12:57:51] <o-O-o> but I see. data() for custom values is always safe and recommended
[12:58:04] <o-O-o> prop() for properties related to user input
[12:58:04] <secretrobotron> demo! http://jsfiddle.net/eMmHC/19/
[12:58:09] <o-O-o> and attr() for the rest
[12:58:11] <o-O-o> right?
[12:58:14] <secretrobotron> seems as thought "overflow: hidden" is the problem
[12:58:20] <secretrobotron> any insight?
[12:58:22] <eddiemonge> o-O-o: data is more for things you define, not part of the html element
[12:58:32] <o-O-o> amazing
[13:01:29] <Guest15785> Is there a special way to handle/trap errors (i.e. 500, 404) from a $.post('/relative_link', {...post_data...}, function(data){}); call?
[13:01:32] <Guest15785> When I try <code>$.ajaxSetup({ error: function(x, e) { console.log(x, e); } });</code> I never get a response.
[13:01:37] <Guest15785> I don't think this is a JSONP request, although the data coming back is JSON.
[13:02:06] <jholloman> secretrobotron: what is the problem you're having? the text is draggable if I put it in a jsfiddle friendly format: http://jsfiddle.net/VMCUA/
[13:03:41] <secretrobotron> jholloman: draggable, but auto-scroll doesn't work
[13:04:23] <jholloman> secretrobotron: what browser are you working in?
[13:04:32] <myrmyron> hrm, .load is surprisingly slow when used on a .dialog-ed div
[13:04:40] <secretrobotron> jholloman: chromium
[13:04:42] <secretrobotron> ummm
[13:04:50] <secretrobotron> 17
[13:04:53] <myrmyron> though only in firefox it seems
[13:05:40] <jholloman> secretrobotron: oh wierd, works well on ie9 and firefox, cursor and text seperate on chrome
[13:05:51] <secretrobotron> jholloman: testing on firefox...
[13:07:02] <PilotBob> any clue as to why .attr("id") does return anything?
[13:07:28] <secretrobotron> huh
[13:07:31] <PilotBob> I am cloning some HTML add appending it... my feeling is I need to change the ID's so they aren't duplicates right?
[13:07:34] <secretrobotron> doesn't work at *all* on firefox here.
[13:07:34] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[13:07:50] <kibble> PilotBob: totally yes
[13:08:31] <jholloman> PilotBob: if the id is not set it wil l return undefined, you should never have duplicate id's
[13:08:32] <kibble> PilotBob: you don't need ID's unless you want to reference that specific element for some reason.  All you need is a name if you want to get post info out of it
[13:09:00] <jholloman> secretrobotron: very strange, this one seems past my knowledge, sorry
[13:09:28] <PilotBob> kibble: so when I clone with even handlers.. it won't need a unique ID to work?
[13:10:00] <kibble> PilotBob: shouldn't have duplicate ID's but leaving it off completely is totally acceptable
[13:10:48] <secretrobotron> jholloman: thanks for trying
[13:11:06] <Guest15785> firing a second request does give the desired result
[13:11:13] <secretrobotron> anyone else know why auto-scroll might fail on a jquery-ui draggable() when container has overflow: hidden?
[13:11:21] <kibble> PilotBob: of course you have fewer options to modify it with js after the fact because you can't reference it directly but you don't need that leave it off, there is no harm
[13:11:40] <Guest15785> perhaps timeout issues?
[13:11:56] <kibble> secretrobotron: overflow is hidden? can't imagine why that would have an issue
[13:12:15] <secretrobotron> kibble: i can't tell if you're joking.
[13:12:24] <kibble> that was the point
[13:12:30] <secretrobotron> that i can't tell?
[13:12:48] <kibble> what would you expect it should do if overflow is hidden?
[13:13:01] <secretrobotron> scroll like normal
[13:13:12] <PilotBob> kibble: well the clone is cloning the existing IDs. I am changing the name but I get no return when I try to do attr("id") so I can muge it the way I do with the name.
[13:13:15] <secretrobotron> since scrollWidth > offsetWidth, it should work
[13:13:25] <secretrobotron> or, at least i'd like it to
[13:14:13] <kibble> PilotBob: can't reliably reference by name because it doesn't have to be unique.  do you need to reference the elements afterwords some how?
[13:14:35] <PilotBob> Although question, if I have a jQuery object something like $(":input") I now want to filter it to only include inputs that don't contain the data-default attribute... how would the filter selector look?
[13:15:03] <gnarf> PilotBob: object.not("[data-default]")
[13:15:14] <gnarf> ?not @PilotBob
[13:15:14] <bot-t> PilotBob, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[13:15:20] <PilotBob> kibble: I "may" need to reference them. But probably not if the event handlers (like those attached with the autocomplete plugin) will still work correctly on the cloned elements.
[13:15:41] <kibble> PilotBob: are there any specific attributes you need to clone that you don't know?  Can't you just make new ones with unique ID's?
[13:16:31] <PilotBob> kibble: I am bulding a plugin so I won't specifically know the elements in in the HTML.
[13:16:36] <kibble> PilotBob: if autocomplete is a plugin it likely doesn't have the .live element so it won't work on newly inserted items
[13:16:57] <kibble> oh I see
[13:17:42] <PilotBob> kibble: but clone(true) is supposed to copy the event handlers... so I assumed any handlers created by a plug in would work against the new elements.
[13:18:04] <PilotBob> gnarf: ah thanks...
[13:18:06] <kibble> I'll claim ignorance
[13:18:50] <PilotBob> kibble: I guess I'll just have to try it with having the duplicate IDs. I didn't expect to have a problem modifying the ids though.
[13:19:30] <kibble> PilotBob: oh the doc's page says clone can change attributes prior to inserting them into the dom
[13:20:11] <wycks> I dont get this, .draggable has a stack and z-index option, they work when an element is being dragged yet when it's released it doesnt apply
[13:20:33] <kibble> PilotBob: doesn't specificly say but .clone().attr('ID', 'foo') should work
[13:21:29] <PilotBob> gnarf: so if I do $("tr:visible:last", this).find(":input").not("[data-default") do I need one .end or two to get back to the set prior to doing the find?
[13:22:04] <gnarf> twice, .not adds to the "stack"
[13:23:14] <PilotBob> kibble: more info... I am cloning a tr that contains tds with inputs. I am trying to do something like clone().find(":input").each() and in the each do
[13:23:25] <gnarf> PilotBob: you could also just var row = $("tr:visible:last", this), inputs = row.find(":input").not("[data-default]");
[13:24:01] <kibble> PilotBob: oh ick more than one element, well I know it can be done but good luck with that
[13:24:25] <PilotBob> kibble: $(this).attr("id", $(this).attr("id").replace(/\[(\d+)\]/, function (str, m1) { return "[" + (parseInt(m1) + 1) + "]" }));
[13:24:34] <Manvaril> Any help on this: http://jsfiddle.net/LpwU2/5/ Please and thank you :)
[13:25:47] <ajpiano> $(this).attr("id",function(i, id) { return id.replace(/\[(\d+)\]/, function (str, m1) { return "[" + (parseInt(m1) + 1) + "]" }); });
[13:25:48] <gnarf> PilotBob: fyi... .attr("id", function( index, id ) { return id.replace(/\[(\d+)\]/, function( _, $1 ) { return "[" + (parseFloat($1)+1) + "]"; });
[13:25:55] <r3ceipts> hello
[13:25:55] <kibble> Manvaril: I'm getting syntax errors
[13:25:56] <gnarf> ajpiano: TIE!
[13:26:01] <ajpiano> gnarf: lol
[13:26:02] <r3ceipts> is there any reason why the following isn't returning anything for me? var test = 'foo'; var a = ['foo','bar']; if (test in a) {console.log('exists');}
[13:26:40] <gnarf> even better PilotBob: function increaseNumber( index, id ) { return id.replace(/\[(\d+)\]/, function( _, $1 ) { return "[" + (parseFloat($1)+1) + "]"; } $(this).attr({ id: increaseNumber, name: increaseNumber });
[13:27:04] <gnarf> im missing a } somewhere there
[13:27:06] <gnarf> but you get the idea
[13:27:10] <ajpiano> r3ceipts: cause in isn't for arrays
[13:27:24] <ajpiano> r3ceipts: see ?inArray
[13:27:25] <bot-t> r3ceipts, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/

[13:28:12] <o-O-o> fap fap fap
[13:28:20] <PilotBob> gnarf: you man do that rather than using each?
[13:28:35] <gnarf> PilotBob: .attr() has a built in "each"
[13:28:53] <gnarf> PilotBob: so you can run the .attr({ id: fn, name: fn }) on the "matched set"
[13:29:09] <PilotBob> gnarf: I did not know that.. cool.
[13:29:20] <r3ceipts> ajpiano: thank you kindly
[13:30:33] <toddWork> in an ajax jsonp function, i can see the 404 in my console but status: 404 doesn't get fired. how do i capture that GET 404 (Not Found) error?
[13:31:23] <sphinxxx> toddWork:  you can't with jsonp
[13:32:04] <toddWork> sphinxxx: is there a clever way to catch a non successful GET?
[13:32:23] <PilotBob> gnarf: so if I want that function in my plugin do I just create it in the plugin function def?
[13:32:42] <gnarf> not really sure what you mean by that
[13:33:36] <q_a_z_steve> Is this not a valid source? <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[13:33:50] <sphinxxx> toddWork:  maybe by using a setTimeout or setInterval,  to check for the success to be fired, if its not fired you know its an error
[13:33:58] <d4rklit3> hi
[13:34:14] <o-O-o> !hi
[13:34:24] <d4rklit3> if i want to capture if someone pastes something into an input box should i use .live("input paste"... ?
[13:34:33] <o-O-o> yes
[13:34:34] <d4rklit3> isn't live deprecated?
[13:36:19] <sphinxxx> yea, use .on
[13:36:33] <r3ceipts> ajpiano: hmm, how does one use if ($.inArray(var,arr)) so as to return false if the var does not exist in arr?
[13:36:48] <d4rklit3> on("input paste"
[13:36:49] <d4rklit3> ?
[13:37:02] <ajpiano> r3ceipts: > -1
[13:37:07] <PilotBob> gnarf: so I still get the error Error: Unable to get value of the property 'replace': object is null or undefined when I try to replace the id... it is like attr("id") is undefined
[13:37:14] <raj> why don't either of these work? console.log($("'#id_" + data[i].id + "'")); console.log($("#id_" + data[i].id))
[13:37:29] <raj> data[i].id is an integer
[13:37:32] <sphinxxx> $('#parentelement').on("click","#targetelement", function(e){});
[13:38:03] <r3ceipts> ajpiano: brilliant, thanks kindly
[13:38:13] <d4rklit3> except that...
[13:38:18] <d4rklit3> its "paste"
[13:38:19] <sphinxxx> ▲ d4rklit3
[13:38:20] <d4rklit3> not "input paste"
[13:39:14] <d4rklit3> what
[13:39:54] <sphinxxx> d4rklit3: actually for that you should use .change  or keyDown
[13:39:58] <Guest15785> @toddWork "Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests."
[13:40:06] <Guest15785> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:40:08] <d4rklit3> not to paste
[13:40:18] <d4rklit3> change is if you click off
[13:40:20] <diegoviola> hi
[13:40:26] <d4rklit3> keyDown is if you press something inside it
[13:40:34] <diegoviola> any plugins similar to fancybox that will work with youtube videos?
[13:40:43] <sphinxxx> d4rklit3:  those are the only options
[13:40:56] <sphinxxx> you can have a function that fires on both those events
[13:41:03] <d4rklit3> so "input paste" doesn't exist?
[13:41:05] <sphinxxx> to catch if the paste it in with a mouse , or a keyboard
[13:41:20] <sphinxxx> idk what that is
[13:42:29] <d4rklit3> "input paste"
[13:42:32] <d4rklit3> detects if you paste
[13:42:40] <d4rklit3> on("input paste", handler)
[13:42:44] <sphinxxx> I've never used it, so i can't really help there
[13:42:45] <d4rklit3> works fine
[13:42:48] <d4rklit3> :)
[13:43:10] <here4thegear> Are there any known issues while working with .each($('.someclass'), function(){}); when "someclass" may be the secondary class to an element such as in <div class="firstclass someclass">
[13:43:58] <sphinxxx> here4thegear: just try it and see if it works, shouldn't be issues
[13:44:20] <Manvaril> @kibble I don't know how your getting syntax errors, its showing fine for me, I'm just trying to figure out why it won't switch out my element
[13:44:41] <jholloman> here4thegear: that shouldn't be a problem
[13:44:51] <Manvaril> the function works but the part where it switches out the button line doesn't switch like it's suppost to
[13:45:59] <here4thegear> Thanks, figured that wouldn't be an issue, and I haven't had any thus far, just wondered if there were any known issues that I should look out for.
[13:51:24] <PilotBob> not strictly a jQuery question, but many js experts here... I have a jquery objects and the have an element name data-default which holds the name a function which is to be run to get its value... how could I do that? Is eval() the key?

[14:01:33] <Eviltwin> I suppose that's now this works:
[14:01:34] <PilotBob> codercube: works a treat... thanks!
[14:01:41] <Eviltwin> ?eval [16] in [2,4,8,16,32]
[14:01:42] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false

[14:01:52] <bot-t> Eviltwin: true
[14:01:57] <codercube> PilotBob ;)
[14:02:01] <Eviltwin> Oh, it's still index based
[14:02:05] <Eviltwin> That's right
[14:02:12] <Eviltwin> ?eval [16] in {16:"x"}
[14:02:13] <bot-t> Eviltwin: true

[14:05:38] <ngharo> xp_prg2: cut the user's hands off
[14:05:43] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin! I have an idea: I'll markup some common websites and we'll find a way to "freeze" them so you can add comments/fix them. --as the basis for your tutorial project. I'll write out why I did what I did (which would be common mistakes) and you can correct it. Kinda before/after...
[14:07:17] <Whirl3d> I can usually get the project done, but it's never as beautiful or as easy as you make it. I think it would be really insightful for people who code like I do to see first hand how you do it.
[14:07:24] <codercube> people, what do you think about google dart?
[14:07:39] <smitty_guy> ?learn
[14:07:39] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:08:23] <johnkpaul> smitty_guy: there you go :)
[14:08:28] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Sounds like a lot of effort for me
[14:08:47] <Whirl3d> not really. I'd do all the work, you'd fix it in about 10 minutes. LOL
[14:08:48] <johnkpaul> codercube: I don't really think it's going anywhere big, but you ask that in ##javascript and you'll get a lot more opinions
[14:09:16] <smitty_guy> johnkpaul: that works for me :)
[14:09:17] <Whirl3d> Then you'd just add comments to explain why it's better to do this....than that...
[14:09:46] <Whirl3d> anybody know whatever happened to DYLAN from Apple?
[14:11:28] <Woet> Whirl3d: google and wikipedia are down for you?
[14:12:06] <Crazy-Zurfer> hello people
[14:12:26] <Whirl3d> why do you ask?
[14:12:45] <Crazy-Zurfer> because he thinks the answer could be there.. might be
[14:13:27] <Whirl3d> Let's see: Google search terms would be:  Anybody in #jquery IRC know about DYLAN?  seems a little backwards to me
[14:13:40] <Zzaichik> So how do I do .NET stuff? It's totally broken and won't load..
[14:13:46] <Zzaichik> ;)
[14:13:49] <Eviltwin> ?down google.com
[14:13:52] <bot-t> Eviltwin, It's just you. - http://google.com is up.
[14:14:24] <WebDragon> plug the ethernet cable back in
[14:14:27] <WebDragon> =)
[14:14:47] <johnkpaul> Woet: downforeveryoneorjustme.com
[14:15:15] <Woet> Whirl3d: no, your google search terms would be "apple dylan"
[14:15:27] <Whirl3d> I think Woet was trying to be a smartass because for some reason he thought I was asking a question that I wasn't
[14:15:57] <Woet> then you would see wikipedia as the first result which clearly says what happened to it
[14:16:17] <WebDragon> even "which way is up" isn't a stupid question, particularly if you've read Ender's Game
[14:16:24] <Whirl3d> Someone brought up DART and in that context, I wondered if anyone here had tried DYLAN. You ain't gonna find that personal kinda stuff on Google or Wikipedia, man.
[14:17:09] <ethanjameson> hi
[14:17:38] <WebDragon> type 'w apple dylan' into the Opera address bar and press enter
[14:18:04] <WebDragon> bypasses intermediate google step and goes straight to wikipedia
[14:18:06] <Woet> Whirl3d: "whatever happened to DYLAN" translates to "who here has used DYLAN"?
[14:18:34] <kibble> WebDragon: but first he has to install opera
[14:19:03] <daxroc> google ferrari in China, bypass google and go directly to content filter :D
[14:19:04] <WebDragon> this conversation seems to have slipped sideways in the same way that where's waldo slipped sideways into where's waldo's mutant fucked up flipper-baby gotten that stack of credit cards
[14:19:07] <Whirl3d> Woet, let's break it down for real: I asked ANYBODY know what happened to Dylan? If you didn't know, stfu
[14:19:27] <Whirl3d> key word was anybody, not what happened to dylan
[14:19:29] <Woet> Whirl3d: yes, I know, because it says so on wikipedia.
[14:19:35] <WebDragon> kibble: IMHO testing in IE9, FF, Chrome and Opera is mandatory for anyone doing development
[14:19:50] <Zzaichik> psht I don't test opera
[14:19:54] <WebDragon> you should
[14:20:05] <Zzaichik> I do test through IE7 though
[14:20:13] <kibble> has ie, ff, chrome, safari and opera only ever use ie and chrome and sometimes ff if I want better js error reporting
[14:20:17] <WebDragon> considering that while it may not be AS popular here in the US, it enjoys a MUCH higher percentage overseas
[14:20:25] <Woet> Zzaichik: you know opera is used less than ie6, right?
[14:20:34] <Zzaichik> ^^
[14:20:35] <WebDragon> Woet: depends on where you're talking about
[14:20:38] <Woet> and is actually dropping even further
[14:20:45] <WebDragon> over here it's used more than the other three combined
[14:20:45] <Woet> WebDragon: any statistic source you can find
[14:20:46] <kibble> and sometimes links or lynx but since most of my devel is php and js the text options aren't useful
[14:20:54] <WebDragon> Woet: my desktop for one
[14:20:57] <Zzaichik> interesting
[14:21:00] <Woet> WebDragon: over here being?
[14:21:05] <WebDragon> where I work
[14:21:05] <Zzaichik> good question
[14:21:16] <Zzaichik> which is…  Canada?
[14:21:19] <Whirl3d> While I appreciate your effort, I was hoping for an account of someone's personal experience with it...not just what the status of it is. The other day, for example, Eviltwin told us about some project that he is working on with a language I had never head of. That kind of thing is nice to hear about from time to time.
[14:21:40] <WebDragon> opera does a better job than the other three for us during development -- that being that when we develop and test primarily with Opera first, the later cross-browser testing has fewer bugs to correct later
[14:21:41] <Woet> Whirl3d: weird way of asking then, but meh
[14:21:56] <WebDragon> saves time
[14:21:56] <daxroc> Whirl3d: what language ?
[14:21:58] <kibble> Whirl3d: I wrote some stuff in cobol a few years ago, want to hear about that
[14:21:58] * Woet <3 chrome
[14:22:13] <WebDragon> still has developer toolbox like firebug and chrome's whatever-its-called
[14:22:15] <Whirl3d> Funny, we were talking about cobol yesterday
[14:22:16] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:22:18] <daxroc> kibble: no thanks, haha
[14:22:22] <Whirl3d> And fortran
[14:22:27] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: I'm forced to work with OCaml at points
[14:22:30] <WebDragon> don't forget Pascal
[14:22:44] <Whirl3d> I loved Pascal.
[14:22:45] <Zzaichik> livescript up in hee
[14:22:46] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:22:56] * WebDragon breaks out the ANSI graphics 
[14:22:58] <kibble> tp was a great language
[14:23:08] <daxroc> bring back lingo !
[14:23:10] <Whirl3d> Anybody remember LOGO (I'm not gonna look it up, btw)
[14:23:11] <WebDragon> http://256.io/escapes.js/ <--
[14:23:18] <WebDragon> heh logo
[14:23:25] <Zzaichik> I like LISP - I don't think that'll ever change
[14:23:25] <Angelos_> lol lingo
[14:23:28] <Whirl3d> logo turtle left...
[14:23:33] <Angelos_> :) Macromedia Director
[14:23:34] <WebDragon> FORTH!
[14:23:37] <kibble> WebDragon: hope it's nsfw
[14:23:39] <WebDragon> 'yourself foot shoot'
[14:23:45] <WebDragon> heh
[14:23:59] <WebDragon> kibble: retro ansi graphics rendered by escape.js

[14:24:13] <Woet> weee chrome
[14:24:15] <WebDragon> thoroughly righteous
[14:24:39] <WebDragon> Woet: depending on where you live those statistics vary wildly
[14:24:46] <Zzaichik> Opera - steady..
[14:24:51] <WebDragon> there's lies, DAMN lies, and statistics
[14:24:54] <Woet> WebDragon: there are some countries that have 1 browser spike out, true
[14:24:55] <kibble> WebDragon: I gathered that, perhaps I was my dirty mind which thought of the bad things
[14:25:14] <WebDragon> even a 2-5% of market-share today is millions of users
[14:25:24] <Whirl3d> I wrote my first word processor in assembly back in 1982)    omg I am so old
[14:25:35] <WebDragon> and quality-and-support-wise for html5 and css3 opera's right up there with the others
[14:25:35] <tw2113> zomg dinosaurs do exist
[14:25:41] <WebDragon> so, it's worth testing for
[14:25:41] <aaronmcadam> you're not old, Whirl3d, just better :)
[14:26:00] <Whirl3d> aww, that's sweet, thx.
[14:26:05] <Zzaichik> haha
[14:26:06] <Whirl3d> not true, but sweet
[14:26:09] <aaronmcadam> haha no worries hahaha
[14:26:24] <tw2113> if you're 45+ you can claim being old in my book
[14:26:31] <WebDragon> it's also quite fast, has a very small memory/install footprint compared to some of the others, has features I like better than in the others (by default not as add-ons)
[14:26:33] <tw2113> whether you claim so or not is up to you
[14:26:34] <aaronmcadam> well, at least you can say you can actually program Whirl3d
[14:26:45] * tw2113 does some php
[14:26:48] <WebDragon> tw2113: <-- ye olde webbe dragonne
[14:26:51] <tw2113> </sortofacoder>
[14:26:55] <WebDragon> lol
[14:26:56] <Angelos_> The oldest computer I had was the 486, do I qualify?
[14:27:05] <WebDragon> I had a trs-80 model III of my own
[14:27:21] <tw2113> you had the trs-1
[14:27:34] <Whirl3d> <--42 here (unless you compare the number of hours I've been awake to the number of hours a normal 42 yo--then I'm about 74)
[14:27:54] <WebDragon> My first video game, I had a telstar arcade, growing up: http://www.retrothing.com/2007/10/the-terrific-tr.html
[14:28:42] <kibble> WebDragon: I've been ashamed to admit I paid for atari classics on android

[14:28:50] <raj> i'm not able to figure out why $item is not gaining a data attribute http://jsfiddle.net/KBZYe/15/
[14:28:51] <kibble> but it has adventure!
[14:28:57] <WebDragon> wumpus!
[14:29:01] <WebDragon> LARN
[14:29:05] <Zzaichik> admitting it is the first step
[14:29:10] <kibble> too bad it doesn't have combat too
[14:29:15] <raj> a little nicer css http://jsfiddle.net/KBZYe/16/ :P
[14:29:23] <WebDragon> heh, how does it make you feel to know I've been _gaming_ longer than you've been _alive_
[14:29:39] <WebDragon> =8)
[14:29:46] <kibble> I hope you're not referencing me
[14:29:56] <kibble> simply because I can't spell
[14:30:01] <WebDragon> you in the collective sense, not the specific sense
[14:30:14] <WebDragon> maybe I should have said y'all but I'm not from the south
[14:30:25] <Zzaichik> it's okay - you can use that word now if you want
[14:30:28] <kibble> South is subjective
[14:30:43] <kibble> Zzaichik: is it up for grabs?  what about goobers?
[14:30:48] <WebDragon> so are browser statistics :P ^_^
[14:31:28] <kibble> lord I should do some work, stop distracting me with nostalgia talk
[14:31:33] <Zzaichik> lol
[14:32:03] <kibble> or maybe I should just go home, my brain is almost fried
[14:32:24] <kibble> whatever happened to Dylan?
[14:32:45] <kristofer91> Can anyone tell me if there's anything wrong with this ?
[14:32:46] <kristofer91> http://pastebin.com/WHr29Jjk
[14:32:55] <wycks> what would be a  good function to use if I want to remove a droppable when its dropped over another element (trash bin)
[14:33:48] <someprimetime> man i want to go to jquerycon but 400 bucks?
[14:33:55] <kibble> ouch
[14:33:57] <someprimetime> i guess i'll just ask my employer
[14:34:00] <someprimetime> (okay)
[14:34:02] <ajpiano> how much do you think tech conferences cost?
[14:34:06] <WebDragon> http://peterhirschberg.com/toys/spacefoodsticks/index.htm  <-- I'm old enough to remember these things
[14:34:10] <WebDragon> O_o
[14:34:14] <someprimetime> i was used to student pricing but i'm no longer a student.. so..
[14:34:36] <someprimetime> but if ajpiano is speaking i'll pay a lotta clams
[14:35:09] <someprimetime> i'd pay to hear ajpiano and Eviltwin just rant all day
[14:35:15] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: that's pretty cheap actually
[14:35:18] <johnkpaul> jsconf was much more
[14:35:31] <someprimetime> where was jsconf?
[14:35:36] <ajpiano> fluentconf is like $1400
[14:35:37] <stalecache> jsconf is sold out right?
[14:35:38] <johnkpaul> it's in two weeks in scotsdale
[14:35:43] <johnkpaul> stalecache: yes
[14:35:48] <someprimetime> oh scottsdale boo
[14:35:53] <stalecache> damn
[14:36:00] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: fluent is only 900 I think
[14:36:02] <someprimetime> my coworker is @ drupalcon in denver right now. i think that'd be a better location
[14:36:08] <johnkpaul> but it's still really expensive
[14:36:08] <someprimetime> even though i don't use drupal.
[14:36:15] <johnkpaul> I'm debating jqueryconf right now actually
[14:36:19] <johnkpaul> I have a place to crash in SF
[14:36:20] <chovy> I have var data = $("select").serialize(); -- how do I add items to data?
[14:36:36] <someprimetime> i work in SF so it won't be a problem to get there
[14:36:42] <someprimetime> so i'm pretty much just looking @ ticket cost
[14:36:46] <someprimetime> which i thinik my employer will cover
[14:36:48] <someprimetime> think*
[14:36:49] <grillermo> i'm not sure how to access a selected object i have this code http://jsfiddle.net/Q3Kkh/
[14:36:56] <someprimetime> as some of my team just went to pycon
[14:37:16] <someprimetime> grillermo: wait what is .some_class?
[14:37:23] <grillermo> a div
[14:37:27] <grillermo> but there are many
[14:37:31] <grillermo> i want to access that
[14:37:36] <grillermo> particular one
[14:37:41] <grillermo> i tried using this
[14:37:47] <grillermo> this
[14:37:57] <someprimetime> you're going to either put a div on it or write a plugin that will namespace each class
[14:38:16] <someprimetime> you mean $(this)?
[14:38:21] <grillermo> mmm but jquery knows what div its visible, what cant i?
[14:38:26] <grillermo> yeah $(this)
[14:38:30] <grillermo> why*
[14:38:33] <kibble> I prefer $(that)
[14:38:36] <someprimetime> $(this) will only work on certain events like click
[14:38:57] <someprimetime> if you put $(this) on a class and have multiple instances of them throughout the page it's too ambiguous
[14:39:00] <grillermo> yeah i was wondering if theres a chainable function to cache a selected object into a variable
[14:39:15] <grillermo> so i can acces it inside my if
[14:39:27] <someprimetime> put an id on it?
[14:39:34] <someprimetime> #js-some-class
[14:39:35] <grillermo> but i have many of those objects
[14:39:48] <someprimetime> ? plugin @grillermo
[14:39:49] <bot-t> grillermo, (function($){ $.pluginName = function() { /* code */ }; $.fn.pluginName = function() { return this.each(function(){ /* code */ }); }; })(jQuery);
[14:39:52] <someprimetime> hmm
[14:39:55] <someprimetime> h/o
[14:40:10] <someprimetime> grillermo: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[14:40:28] <grillermo> ok thanks
[14:42:08] <grillermo> actually what i'm trying to do is run some code each time an particular dom object is visible on the viewport, do you know a plugin that does this?
[14:43:44] <wycks> anyone help me with logic here, how do I remove only the element that is dragged over "trash" http://jsfiddle.net/KWdcU/3/
[14:44:43] <rroelofs> wycks: check out the prameters that get pssed to over
[14:45:48] <rroelofs> wycks: altho you probably want the drop event instead
[14:46:11] <wycks> what parameters, in this case they all have same class name
[14:46:26] <rroelofs> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#event-drop
[14:46:50] <rroelofs> your function gets an event obj and a ui obj which has the reference you are looing for
[14:47:00] <wycks> ah ok
[14:47:35] <wycks> ty
[14:54:21] <kanzie> are triggers unreliable?
[14:54:54] <kanzie> Im trying to use them now but even though the debugger passes the $.trigger the corresponding .on() does not fire
[14:57:12] <rroelofs> Does the selector match?
[14:57:29] <kanzie> yeah, I had them fire properly before
[14:57:31] <kanzie> but not any longer
[14:57:36] <kanzie> and Ihaven't really changed the code
[14:57:47] <kanzie> so I'm starting to feel like they are not 100% solid to rely on
[14:57:58] <Eviltwin> Feeling like you can't rely on selectors?
[14:58:10] <kanzie> haha, nah…triggers()
[14:58:13] <tw2113> did they betray you as a child?
[14:58:36] <Eviltwin> jQuery has a document 30% loss rate on .trigger
[14:58:38] <Eviltwin> So avoid it
[14:58:49] <ravenzz> who like challenges?
[14:58:52] <ravenzz> :p
[14:58:57] <kanzie> Eviltwin: seriously?
[14:59:02] <Eviltwin> kanzie: No
[14:59:11] <Eviltwin> You must be doing something wrong
[14:59:15] <Eviltwin> Make a small jsFiddle example
[14:59:29] <Eviltwin> That illustrates your problem
[14:59:37] <Eviltwin> ravenzz: Don't ask to ask :P
[14:59:54] <kanzie> well, I assume the fiddles would work. I've used triggers a bit before, only now that Im seeing them glitch
[15:00:12] <kanzie> yep, don't fire at all
[15:00:24] <Eviltwin> kanzie: You probably either have an error that you're masking somehow or you have a race condition or something
[15:01:28] <ravenzz> me/you should hack into the twitter js trying to figure out how the timeline update/new tweets display could be hook.
[15:02:04] <kanzie> Eviltwin: Does it matter with element I attach the trigger to?
[15:02:12] <ravenzz> I run some code, but i need to run it again when new tweets comes up
[15:02:15] <kanzie> As in, are there any concerns I should consider
[15:05:11] <Eviltwin> kanzie: Uh... what?
[15:05:22] <Eviltwin> You can't "attach" a trigger
[15:05:43] <kanzie> nah, meant the listener
[15:05:49] <kanzie> but Im sure it is a race problem...
[15:05:54] <kanzie> I need to filter out some code
[15:05:58] <kanzie> and find the bug
[15:12:05] <Advocated> i've got a dialog to open on hover of an icon, this works well, i repeat the process from another icon, before i open the dialogs i close all dialogs, but if i open one, then the other, its showing the 2nd dialog underneath the other one and making the page scroll down?
[15:24:31] <sorush20> hi
[15:24:37] <Jesdisciple> hihi
[15:24:44] <RoosterJuice> how do i print the contents of a div?
[15:24:49] <sorush20> www.sorushnazari.com/tiempolatinolondres
[15:24:53] <RoosterJuice> or access it
[15:25:14] <RoosterJuice> is it $(mything).text()?
[15:25:15] <sorush20> this site is not showing the login windows
[15:25:30] <sorush20> What could the problem be?
[15:25:44] <Jesdisciple> RoosterJuice: if you want text and not HTML, yes
[15:26:00] <RoosterJuice> Jesdisciple, thanx!
[15:26:07] <Jesdisciple> :)
[15:26:46] <RoosterJuice> Jesdisciple, if i return the html, does that mean it will include the "<" special characters?
[15:26:55] <Jesdisciple> yep
[15:27:08] <Jesdisciple> sorush20: looking, although I don't know lots about Canvas...
[15:27:22] <johnkpaul> sorush20: that page is oddly convoluted, it has mootools, jquery 1.7 and jquery 1.5 all loaded
[15:27:23] <johnkpaul> at the same time
[15:27:45] <johnkpaul> and there are js errors
[15:28:24] <sorush20> johnkpaul: the errors I can see in the console I just don't know what they mean..
[15:29:33] <Jesdisciple> sorush20: I don't see errors, but I don't see an event-handler on your link either
[15:29:40] <Jesdisciple> just an href="#helpdiv"
[15:30:24] <windsurf_> My selector is valid, why does this have no effect? (and no error):
[15:30:24] <windsurf_> jQuery(".app .businessMetadata").effect("scale", {percent:200,direction:'vertical'},1000);
[15:30:28] <Jesdisciple> not sure whether Firefox's computed HTML includes event-handlers...
[15:30:45] <windsurf_> I'm trying to have a rectangular strip expand to then reveal its contents which can fade in at the same time or shortly after
[15:31:56] <Jesdisciple> sorush20: ah, found it - line 63\
[15:33:38] <sorush20> in which file Jesdisciple
[15:33:51] <Jesdisciple> sorush20: line 63 is reached but the logic in that function, line 64, never runs
[15:33:55] <Jesdisciple> in the HTML file
[15:34:21] <Jesdisciple> a.addEvent isn't doing its job
[15:34:55] <Jesdisciple> track down which library that came from and ask people who know it... I know it's not jQuery
[15:35:21] <windsurf_> working now.
[15:38:34] * Jesdisciple wishes people would explain what the problem was
[15:38:57] <kanzie> Im using the $.keyboard() plugin, but for iPads I wish to not load it. How can I make this selection?
[15:39:34] <kanzie> do I check for device and disable plugin?
[15:39:56] <ryanneufeld> ?g detect ipad @ kanzie
[15:39:57] <bot-t> kanzie, iPad Detection Using JavaScript or PHP - http://davidwalsh.name/detect-ipad
[15:40:54] <kanzie> ryanneufeld: and checking for iPhone?
[15:41:34] <ryanneufeld> kanzie: try this: http://bit.ly/GCkXVz
[15:41:53] <nathanstaines> is anyone able to tell me if/how I could improve this JS? http://jsfiddle.net/nathanstaines/DZKcs/
[15:53:44] <nathanstaines> hmm, I might try again tomorrow...
[15:54:23] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:54:40] <ryanneufeld> nathanstaines: yeah, for starters that thing you're doing with the html in the data attr
[15:54:44] <ryanneufeld> stop doing that
[15:54:50] <ryanneufeld> ?clone @ nathanstaines
[15:54:51] <bot-t> nathanstaines, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[15:54:53] <aaronmcadam> wtf
[15:55:07] <ryanneufeld> my thoughts exactly aaronmcadam
[15:55:09] <sorush20> I still can't identify the fault..
[15:55:13] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:55:15] <nathanstaines> i'm not controling the html - that's done by symfony
[15:55:19] <aaronmcadam> that's horrible
[15:55:42] <aaronmcadam> __escaped__ html too
[15:55:50] <aaronmcadam> what in the fuck is that
[15:56:39] <aaronmcadam> For a start, from purely UX, Enter doesn't work
[15:56:54] <aaronmcadam> and for some reason, you can't delete your first domain?
[15:56:57] <nathanstaines> the html markup comes for here http://symfony.com/
[15:57:13] <ryanneufeld> wait, so you took it from anothers web sit?
[15:57:17] <aaronmcadam> templating is what you want
[15:57:23] <ryanneufeld> or you're using the symfony framework
[15:57:24] <aaronmcadam> or, clone yes
[15:57:35] <ryanneufeld> in this case
[15:57:42] <ryanneufeld> clone is the better option
[15:57:53] <aaronmcadam> uhuh
[15:58:03] <aaronmcadam> no variable data
[15:58:03] <josefig_> hello, I need some help with this simple delay. I want a simple feature that when I type something in default value another text gets disable, I tried this http://jsfiddle.net/QNCaZ/ but it delays something is not very clear, can you give me a hand ?
[15:58:11] <nathanstaines> alright thanks i'll check clone out
[15:58:20] <aaronmcadam> what's this whole $$name about
[15:58:23] <aaronmcadam> rotten
[15:58:34] <nathanstaines> that's some symfony thing
[15:58:45] <aaronmcadam> why are you switching between using `this` and `addDomain`
[15:59:06] <aaronmcadam> makes it look like you're not understanding `this`
[15:59:13] <ryanneufeld> maybe he isn't
[15:59:32] <ryanneufeld> which is okay, cause it can be tricky
[15:59:32] <aaronmcadam> either switch to using `addDomain` for everything
[15:59:51] <aaronmcadam> yeah it can, but switching between will make it confusing for others
[15:59:58] <aaronmcadam> i.e. makes it worse
[16:00:00] <nathanstaines> there is a good chance i'm misunderstanding a lot of things. that's why i'm asking for help ;)
[16:00:05] <ryanneufeld> I agree
[16:00:15] <ryanneufeld> with both of you :p
[16:00:22] <aaronmcadam> you need this
[16:00:23] <aaronmcadam> http://www.watchmecode.net/javascript-context
[16:00:33] <aaronmcadam> no pun intended :p
[16:00:47] <ryanneufeld> :{
[16:01:08] <nathanstaines> i've been working my way through this: http://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/
[16:01:18] <aaronmcadam> oh right
[16:01:31] <aaronmcadam> buy that video, it's worth it
[16:01:46] <aaronmcadam> all of derick's videos are decent
[16:02:09] <josefig_> anyone can help me ?
[16:02:33] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: but your style isn't too bad, if you're still a beginner
[16:02:50] <nathanstaines> yeah, still very much early days for me
[16:03:04] <aaronmcadam> what other langs do u know?
[16:03:31] <nathanstaines> none
[16:03:37] <aaronmcadam> what?
[16:03:46] <aaronmcadam> you've never programmed before?
[16:03:48] <nathanstaines> well besides html and css
[16:03:53] <nathanstaines> nope
[16:04:10] <aaronmcadam> you've just got good attention to detail of tutorials then?
[16:05:04] <nathanstaines> basically just trying to learn as much as i can about javascript and jquery atm
[16:05:20] <aaronmcadam> well I'm very impressed with what you've got so far
[16:05:29] <nathanstaines> but i want to learn the correct way to do things
[16:05:39] <aaronmcadam> that's good!
[16:06:03] <nathanstaines> http://jqfundamentals.com/ and the tutsplus videos have been my main sources of information
[16:06:11] <aaronmcadam> cool
[16:06:22] <aaronmcadam> Addy Osmani's posts are very good
[16:06:31] <nathanstaines> i'll definitely check them out
[16:06:40] <aaronmcadam> you're so lucky learning now haha
[16:06:43] <aaronmcadam> there's lots of good stuff
[16:07:21] <Jesdisciple> josefig_: what do you mean by delay? I don't see setTimeout
[16:07:24] <aaronmcadam> messing with that prototype is a bit silly tho
[16:07:30] <nathanstaines> I know douglas crockford is meant to have some great resources as well, but I don't think i'm ready for them yet :P
[16:07:32] <aaronmcadam> I'm taking you've copied that from symfony tho
[16:07:38] <aaronmcadam> YUI videos yeah
[16:07:44] <aaronmcadam> nah try a couple
[16:07:48] <aaronmcadam> see how u get on
[16:07:55] <josefig_> Jesdisciple, :P
[16:08:01] <Jesdisciple> ;)
[16:08:01] <aaronmcadam> you'd be surprised what u pick up on stuff you think is too advanced
[16:08:16] <nathanstaines> yeah, I'm not able to change the html for this project so figured I could do something with that data attribute
[16:08:27] <aaronmcadam> http://javascriptweekly.com/ subscribe to that
[16:08:51] <Jesdisciple> aaronmcadam: that looks like a one-sided convo...
[16:09:01] <aaronmcadam> one-sided?
[16:09:01] <Jesdisciple> ah nvm
[16:09:13] <ravenzz> gnarf
[16:09:16] <Jesdisciple> the names are exactly the same length in my client, too close
[16:09:28] <nathanstaines> haha
[16:09:32] <aaronmcadam> oh
[16:09:34] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: http://javascriptshow.com/
[16:09:37] * Jesdisciple deletes messages from the Internet
[16:09:39] <aaronmcadam> good podcast on new stuff
[16:10:17] <nathanstaines> great, thanks a lot for the help
[16:10:54] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[16:11:31] <danzik17> nathanstaines: also when you've learned some basic stuff in a couple of weeks or whenever, read through the jQuery source.  i learned a crap load back when i did that
[16:11:49] <NoReGreT> in .prev(selector), what's the use of selector ? will it go prev() till it matches the selector ?
[16:12:07] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines, danzik17: this tool is useful for that http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=
[16:12:36] <nathanstaines> danzik17: yeah, I've had a quick look through it and i'm sure it'll make more sense as time goes on
[16:12:59] <aaronmcadam> james padolsey's viewer shows you the specific source for a method
[16:13:03] <danzik17> aaronmcadam: uh, that sir is amazing.  if it works well, that'll save me some time rather than digging thru the source
[16:13:13] <aaronmcadam> it does work yep
[16:13:18] <aaronmcadam> give it a go
[16:13:47] <aaronmcadam> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.inArray
[16:14:04] <nathanstaines> alright, i'm going to try using clone()
[16:14:09] <nathanstaines> thanks again ;)
[16:14:10] <aaronmcadam> ?clone @ nathanstaines
[16:14:11] <bot-t> nathanstaines, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[16:14:30] <aaronmcadam> anytime nathanstaines
[16:15:24] <danzik17> aaronmcadam: the only thing im wondering is would that capture stuff like a regex defined outside of what you're looking at....thats not a *huge* deal though, can always look it up if need be.
[16:16:04] <danzik17> aaronmcadam: wow you know what, it freaking does.  it links to it.
[16:16:07] <aaronmcadam> danzik17: it links any global function calls
[16:16:17] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:16:57] <aaronmcadam> this is his new version
[16:16:58] <aaronmcadam> http://jsapi.info/
[16:17:09] <aaronmcadam> http://jsapi.info/jquery/1.7.1/
[16:17:31] <aaronmcadam> different interface tho, I prefer the inline search
[16:18:04] <sorush20> can someone have look at the code again to see how I've done?
[16:18:23] <eddiemonge> the related links are wrong
[16:18:42] <danzik17> yea, that one isn't inline linking vars or stuff, so you can't see declared regexes and stuff like that.  im liking the first link better
[16:18:52] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: what about this one? http://jsapi.info/jquery/1.7.1/jQuery.fn.height
[16:19:13] <aaronmcadam> looks ok to me
[16:19:23] <eddiemonge> its looking at related to jQuery.fn, which pretty much everything is
[16:19:38] <aaronmcadam> http://jsapi.info/jquery/1.7.1/jQuery.isWindow
[16:19:46] <aaronmcadam> I got to that from fn.height?
[16:20:12] <eddiemonge> ?swap
[16:20:13] <bot-t> eddiemonge, #10754 (have jQuery.swap return the return of the callback instead ... - Opened 4 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10754
[16:20:47] <eddiemonge> also showing private methods like http://jsapi.info/jquery/1.7.1/jQuery.swap
[16:21:19] <aaronmcadam> aren't u gonna see that anyway
[16:21:33] <aaronmcadam> can't stop people using undocumented shit
[16:22:00] <eddiemonge> but if its documented somewhere, more likely to use it
[16:22:09] <aaronmcadam> ah, properties of jQuery itself I see
[16:29:34] <crutex> 
[16:31:36] <someprimetime> would it be possible to calculate the size (in px) of text within an anchor tag?
[16:31:43] <someprimetime> or should i put it within a <span> and measure that?
[16:32:15] <someprimetime> i guess i should just wrap it in a <span class="js-wrapper"> and get $(.js-wrapper').width() no?
[16:33:32] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[16:33:39] <aaronmcadam> the font-size of the text you mean?
[16:34:00] <aaronmcadam> oh right, the actual width of the word within the link?
[16:34:02] <aaronmcadam> that's mental
[16:34:06] <aaronmcadam> why do u want that?
[16:34:22] <someprimetime> because i'm making a tooltip plugin so i need to know where to offset it to position it
[16:34:36] <someprimetime> i should probably look into how other people are making theirs tbh
[16:34:37] <aaronmcadam> <a> and <span> are both inline, so they'll probably end up with the same width
[16:34:41] <aaronmcadam> why?
[16:34:49] <someprimetime> why am i making it?
[16:34:55] <aaronmcadam> tipsy is one of shitload of tooltip plugins
[16:35:04] <someprimetime> i prefer to write my own stuff since i learn more in the process
[16:35:05] <aaronmcadam> twitter bootstrap has another
[16:35:16] <aaronmcadam> ah you've got the time?
[16:35:18] <someprimetime> i'll look @ how boostrap does it
[16:35:20] <eddiemonge> so does jqueryui
[16:35:26] <someprimetime> well right now i'm waiting for my boss to give me an assignment
[16:35:27] <crutex> 
[16:35:32] <someprimetime> so i thought i'd just make one real quick
[16:35:42] <crutex> 
[16:35:49] <aaronmcadam> I don't think you really need to get the width of the actual text
[16:35:54] <aaronmcadam> the container will be the same width
[16:35:59] <someprimetime> yeah, true
[16:36:32] <aaronmcadam> if u make them display block as well, maybe then that'd make sure they fill the full parent container
[16:36:35] <someprimetime> i'll just get the parent()'s width and position it 1/2 of the container (to center it)
[16:36:40] <eddiemonge> are you going to take into account where the tooltip is positioned, like if its at the edge of the screen
[16:36:42] <someprimetime> yeah, that'll work well actually
[16:37:07] <aaronmcadam> someprimetime: look at how tipsy handles eddiemonge's issue, it has that
[16:37:09] <eddiemonge> is it going to follow the mouse or be static within that hover?
[16:37:18] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: static
[16:37:19] <eddiemonge> tooltips are kind of complex
[16:37:20] <someprimetime> which is easier
[16:37:29] <someprimetime> and yeah good point on the edge of the window issue
[16:37:33] <someprimetime> shouldn't be too bad
[16:37:53] <eddiemonge> they are one of the more complex UI components
[16:38:10] <someprimetime> cool. it'll be a good learning project then
[16:38:14] <eddiemonge> because it needs spatially aware positioning, sizing, mouse events, ....
[16:38:27] <eddiemonge> its more planning than coding thoug
[16:45:14] <James13433> Can someone help me with this, http://pastebin.com/t3eB22fh. I want to change the container from just <ol> too <div><ol>.
[16:46:39] <eddiemonge> James13433: ok. whats going wrong when you try to do that?
[16:46:41] <aaronmcadam> ?wrap @ James13433
[16:46:42] <bot-t> James13433, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[16:47:24] <James13433> eddiemonge, well <ol> just goes at the top and the content is inserted in the div but below the ol
[16:47:38] <eddiemonge> do you know why that is?
[16:47:56] <James13433> yeah, cause its appending it to the main div I belive
[16:48:14] <eddiemonge> correct. so what would be needed to append it to the ol and not the div?
[16:48:37] <James13433> A genious to tell me via irc
[16:48:47] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[16:48:47] <James13433> I don;t know
[16:48:54] <aaronmcadam> the clue is in his question
[16:48:57] <crutex> 
[16:49:05] <aaronmcadam> what is this dude doing
[16:49:06] <nathanstaines> aaronmcadam: any of those links you shared earlier cover which selectors are best to use? such as find('div').first vs find('div:first')?
[16:49:27] <eddiemonge> .first is better
[16:49:33] <crutex> 
[16:49:34] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: yes, avoid pseudo-selectors
[16:49:41] <eddiemonge> addyosmani has a blog post about it
[16:49:42] <aaronmcadam> can somebody kick this crutex guy
[16:49:51] <crutex> its a bug in my client
[16:49:56] <crutex> when someone tries to xdcc file transfer me...
[16:50:01] <James13433> Still not following, but I could just wrap the result right? or is there  better way
[16:50:06] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: http://www.slideshare.net/AddyOsmani/jquery-proven-performance-tips-tricks
[16:50:10] <eddiemonge> crutex: you should fix that. you are spamming the channel
[16:50:19] <crutex> well i've solved it now
[16:50:25] <aaronmcadam> sorry crutex :)
[16:50:31] <eddiemonge> James13433: im assuming you changed your code to $("<div><ol>.... right?
[16:50:34] <aaronmcadam> thought u were just spamming
[16:50:39] <crutex> :)
[16:50:48] <nathanstaines> I find that i'm chaining a lot of methods. is that bad?
[16:50:50] <James13433> yes eddiemonge
[16:51:18] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: not empirically, you're already putting each chained method on its own line, that's a start
[16:51:22] <eddiemonge> James13433: you have a few options. you could append $markerContainer to a new div and then append that div to your document
[16:51:34] <eddiemonge> well thats pretty much what they all boil down to
[16:51:50] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: what's important is keeping the line length of your functions down
[16:51:56] <James13433> ok thanks dude
[16:52:01] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: as in the number of lines
[16:52:07] <eddiemonge> it really depends on what your end goal is
[16:52:48] <nathanstaines> aaronmcadam: so it's not really causing jquery to do more work than it needs to?
[16:52:56] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: if you try to limit your functions to only doing one thing
[16:53:12] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: it's *better* for jQuery really
[16:53:22] <aaronmcadam> it's a code usability issue though
[16:53:30] <aaronmcadam> that's why I said it's not empirically bad or good
[16:54:00] <nathanstaines> fair enough, i've been avoiding it where i can
[16:54:03] <aaronmcadam> if you read about the end method ?see end @ nathanstaines
[16:54:06] <crutex> 
[16:54:28] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: if you cache your selectors into a variable, that's about the same
[16:54:41] <aaronmcadam> ?end @ nathanstaines
[16:54:47] <aaronmcadam> ?botsnack
[16:54:55] <aaronmcadam> ah balls bot's sleeping
[16:55:27] <nathanstaines> i do recall seeing the end method used somewhere i'll take another look
[16:56:10] <aaronmcadam> ?botsnack
[16:56:11] <eddiemonge> bot-t: are you alive?
[16:56:18] <eddiemonge> caniuse: end
[16:56:19] <aaronmcadam> it's here
[16:56:24] <aaronmcadam> but not responding
[16:56:38] <aaronmcadam> crutex: it's not fixed
[16:57:08] <eddiemonge> nathanstaines: .end() returns your collection to the place before its last search/filter http://api.jquery.com/end
[16:57:15] <crutex> now it is
[16:57:22] <aaronmcadam> let's see :p
[16:58:57] <nathanstaines> eddiemonge: thanks ;)
[16:59:08] <James13433> eddiemonge, :( not having any luck.
[16:59:27] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ James13433
[16:59:28] <bot-t1> James13433, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. If I can't easily edit and save the code back, I'm not going to help you. Make it easier for me to help you by helping me
[16:59:52] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: if only every beginner was like u dude :D
[17:00:27] <nathanstaines> aaronmcadam: ha thanks, let's hope it pays off
[17:00:46] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: were you around a few days ago with the whole AngryBirds eposide
[17:00:53] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: definitely man, it will, I'd hire you
[17:00:56] <eddiemonge> AngryBirds, AngryDude something like that
[17:01:30] <aaronmcadam> haha nah, been off irc for a bit, had a mad week
[17:02:08] <aaronmcadam> inter-agency work is so much fun :|
[17:02:20] <eddiemonge> he was like, i dont want to learn i just want it fixed. i dont care what why its not working just make it work for me
[17:02:45] <eddiemonge> said his problem, something works on index page but on any other page it doesnt
[17:02:59] <aaronmcadam> yeah, there's far too many "you owe me" attitudes in here, that's why I'm commending this guy
[17:03:38] <nathanstaines> aaronmcadam: to be honest, it's people like you that make learning things that much easier. those Addy Osmani slides are great. thanks
[17:03:40] <eddiemonge> i said to lookup what a relative vs absolute url path and he went off on my because i linked him to an article describing it. hes like, you cant tell me one line of code instead of having me read 50000 lines
[17:03:40] <aaronmcadam> nothing more frustrating than the "it doesn't work" bug report
[17:03:46] <eddiemonge> it was funny
[17:04:12] <Guest8629> hi
[17:04:15] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: you'd do yourself a huge favour if you read all of his stuff
[17:04:34] <aaronmcadam> I've met the guy, he's so helpful it's unreal
[17:04:53] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: I've been stung by that sooo many times
[17:05:18] <eddiemonge> nathanstaines: you could always offer aaronmcadam a small donation if you really want to show gratitude. otherwise your thanks is good too
[17:05:28] <nathanstaines> aaronmcadam: just bookmarked his blog
[17:05:33] <aaronmcadam> haha I never accept donations anyways
[17:06:14] <aaronmcadam> but I'd love to be able to do some consulting on the side if I could
[17:06:22] <nathanstaines> aaronmcadam: what about beer/coffee?
[17:06:28] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[17:07:04] <aaronmcadam> you're alright nathanstaines ya don't owe me anything man
[17:07:37] <disappearedng> Did jquery deprecate pulsate?
[17:07:49] <aaronmcadam> what? was that an easing?
[17:08:46] <eddiemonge> its still there http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/
[17:09:00] <eddiemonge> that is one annoying effect
[17:09:00] <aaronmcadam> ahhh, right
[17:09:04] <aaronmcadam> haha!
[17:09:17] <aaronmcadam> what do you think of jQuery Rumble haha
[17:09:43] <aaronmcadam> eeesh yeah eddiemonge
[17:11:44] <aaronmcadam> I can't see how that effect would ever be useful
[17:11:46] <eddiemonge> rumble is cool. except for eating at my cpu
[17:11:51] <aaronmcadam> haha
[17:12:09] <eddiemonge> id prefer a growl type notification
[17:12:14] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[17:12:46] <nathanstaines> http://jsperf.com is great for testing performance then?
[17:12:56] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: seen this: http://needim.github.com/noty/
[17:13:09] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: yup
[17:13:15] <eddiemonge> nathanstaines: the best
[17:13:21] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: also, integrate jshint into your workflow
[17:13:45] <nathanstaines> have that built into my text editor ;)
[17:14:02] <eddiemonge> wookiehangover: can you jshint vim plugin auto lint on save?
[17:14:08] <aaronmcadam> great!
[17:14:31] <aaronmcadam> I use Syntastic for that eddiemonge
[17:14:57] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39519/talks/jquk-tooling%2Bappstack/index.html
[17:15:34] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic
[17:15:54] <aaronmcadam> then npm install jshint and it just picks it up when you change the config
[17:16:07] <aaronmcadam> well, I mean, add the line to your .vimrc
[17:16:36] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: let g:syntastic_javascript_checker = "jshint"
[17:17:06] <aaronmcadam> anyone on linux btw?
[17:17:17] <aaronmcadam> I want to install Canary dammit
[17:17:17] <nathanstaines> aaronmcadam: what's that meant to say on the last page?
[17:17:28] <aaronmcadam> what one?
[17:17:42] <nathanstaines> jquk tooling
[17:17:47] <nathanstaines> by paul irish
[17:17:49] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[17:17:53] <aaronmcadam> the last slide?
[17:18:08] <eddiemonge> hmm maybe that could be my talk proposal for JQSF12: jquery performance
[17:18:19] <nathanstaines> yeah the last slide
[17:18:44] <aaronmcadam> ah I can't remember! I was there
[17:18:56] <wookiehangover> eddiemonge: ya, it autohints on save
[17:19:03] <wookiehangover> also on newlines
[17:19:11] <aaronmcadam> ah, that's handy
[17:19:18] <aaronmcadam> what's the plugin wookiehangover?
[17:19:21] <eddiemonge> wookiehangover: did i have to add something to my vimrc?
[17:19:57] <wookiehangover> eddiemonge: should just work
[17:20:09] <wookiehangover> its literally the same as the jslint vim plugin
[17:20:14] <wookiehangover> but with the libs swapped out
[17:20:16] <aaronmcadam> nathanstaines: I forgot to say, Chrome is best for that slidedeck
[17:20:31] <aaronmcadam> ah, I use syntastic as i said
[17:21:02] <nathanstaines> i checked it chrome but the last slide looks like i'm missing a font or something
[17:21:18] <aaronmcadam> yeh me too
[17:21:32] <nathanstaines> thought it might just be something i didn't understand
[17:21:52] <nathanstaines> like paul irish being trying to be funny
[17:21:53] <aaronmcadam> yeh paul's always doing funny stuff, it might mean something haha
[17:22:29] <aaronmcadam> he's mad, I got to have a few drinks with him too
[17:23:27] <eddiemonge> wookiehangover: ah, it does the checking inline instead of showing a list in a new window
[17:23:58] <eddiemonge> any way to quick jump to the next error?
[17:24:49] <aaronmcadam> finally!
[17:25:08] <aaronmcadam> found a canary equivalent for linux, chromium hourly builds: http://download-chromium.appspot.com/
[17:25:27] <aaronmcadam> Really useful user agent switcher
[17:26:23] <eddiemonge> wookiehangover: never mind, find the un-intuitive options. might need to remap them or post-it them
[17:26:25] <aaronmcadam> Brilliant, now need to whack together a shell script to pull the latest copy
[17:27:34] <wookiehangover> eddiemonge: haha feel free to fork and contribute to the readme
[17:27:48] <aaronmcadam> what's the repo url?
[17:28:30] <eddiemonge> wookiehangover: after my last pr mess up with that im scared
[17:28:40] <wookiehangover> lol
[17:28:45] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/wookiehangover/jshint.vim
[17:28:51] <aaronmcadam> hmm, think I'm gonna finally have to make a proper effort to learn chrome web tools
[17:29:06] <aaronmcadam> thanks eddiemonge
[17:29:20] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: you havent yet?
[17:29:28] <aaronmcadam> well, I've dabbled
[17:29:32] <aaronmcadam> but always fall back to firebug
[17:29:48] <aaronmcadam> but it's just so bloody buggy and slow now
[17:30:01] <aaronmcadam> also, having crashing issues with my gvim
[17:30:05] <eddiemonge> wookiehangover: why does the rakefile zip up the files to move them instead of just moving them?
[17:30:09] <aaronmcadam> must be a rogue plugin
[17:30:44] <eddiemonge> i switched to chrome dev tools and havent looked back. been over a year i think
[17:31:00] <eddiemonge> keep finding new surprises that thrill me
[17:31:04] <aaronmcadam> haha
[17:31:11] <aaronmcadam> Source Maps are really awesome
[17:31:12] <someprimetime> chrome dev tools ftw
[17:31:25] <eddiemonge> i dont know why firefox didnt buy firebug and use that as their base instead of starting from scratch
[17:31:43] <someprimetime> protip: to preserve network connection click on the circle at the bottom of the Network tab
[17:31:47] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: I just need to find a good advanced walkthrough of everything, rewatch paul's videos
[17:31:49] <someprimetime> too bad it won't do this for the console yet
[17:32:08] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: nightly's tools are nice tho!
[17:32:10] <someprimetime> aaronmcadam: just keep playing with it.. it's pretty easy to understand
[17:32:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah I know, but it's just when ur used to Firebug, etc etc
[17:32:26] <someprimetime> some similarities between it and firebug
[17:32:28] <aaronmcadam> simple things
[17:32:28] <someprimetime> yeah i understand
[17:32:43] <aaronmcadam> like now they've moved the checkboxes in the style to the left
[17:32:44] <someprimetime> just like why i stick with vim. it's pretty universal and i don't have to relearn stuff
[17:32:50] <eddiemonge> yeah took me awhile to fully transition too
[17:32:53] <James13433> Is there a way to turn numbers into text? but not just 1 to "1" but 1 to "one" ?
[17:32:54] <aaronmcadam> used to always find it awkward to change styles
[17:33:07] <eddiemonge> well vim is the best. why would you switch?
[17:33:11] <aaronmcadam> haha
[17:33:17] <James13433> acctuly dm
[17:33:18] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: i was using netbeans for cakephp
[17:33:21] <aaronmcadam> I need to find out what's crashing my vim tho
[17:33:23] <eddiemonge> James13433: create a dictionary array or look one up
[17:33:26] <someprimetime> it's nice for MVC based projects
[17:33:37] <aaronmcadam> I use PyCharm for django
[17:33:42] <aaronmcadam> with vim bindings
[17:33:48] <someprimetime> but i do use vim @ work with pylons, and i get kind of tired of `cd`ing all the time
[17:33:52] <aaronmcadam> *sort of* works, kinda fucks up randomly tho
[17:33:58] <James13433> only reason was for css but will just prepend with text
[17:34:05] <eddiemonge> netbeans was too bloated for me. i used it for a year and got tired of it
[17:34:14] <someprimetime> yeah i've got vim bindings for some python stuff.. 4 tab spacing, mako spacing with 2 tabs etc
[17:34:32] <aaronmcadam> someprimetime, eddiemonge: only problem is, *any* editor I end up trying to use vim commands lol, even jsbin or jsfiddle, gedit, etc#
[17:34:49] <eddiemonge> yeah
[17:34:50] <someprimetime> haha yeah
[17:34:51] <someprimetime> i do the same
[17:34:55] <eddiemonge> ok time for home. laterz
[17:34:55] <someprimetime> escape : wq
[17:34:59] <someprimetime> woops i'm in a webpage
[17:34:59] <someprimetime> o.o
[17:35:07] <aaronmcadam> it's amazing how the mnemonics get stuck in your head
[17:35:20] <someprimetime> jsfiddle needs line numbering though
[17:35:30] <aaronmcadam> *every* editor does
[17:35:39] <aaronmcadam> dunno how anybody can work without em
[17:35:42] <someprimetime> it always adds <c200> or something too when i copy and paste from from there into vim
[17:36:00] <someprimetime> it'd be so god damn easy to put lines in jsfiddle too
[17:36:02] <aaronmcadam> wonder what that is
[17:36:05] <someprimetime> hell you can do it with a number <li>
[17:36:17] <aaronmcadam> I don't know why they don't just use ACe
[17:36:19] <aaronmcadam> Ace*
[17:36:23] <someprimetime> it's usually when i remove the tab spacing though
[17:36:29] <someprimetime> that the text is appended
[17:36:47] <nathanstaines> ok i'm out for the night. thanks for your help aaronmcadam
[17:36:56] <aaronmcadam> no probs man good luck
[17:37:02] <aaronmcadam> even CodeMirror would work
[17:37:16] <nathanstaines> cheers ;)
[17:37:17] <aaronmcadam> the maintainer of that project is *smart*
[17:37:53] <iamjarvo> is there a jquery plugin that allows table headers to have a gradient in  IE
[17:38:01] <aaronmcadam> wow
[17:38:10] <aaronmcadam> you mean CSS3?
[17:38:36] <aaronmcadam> not tried -ms- prefixed rules?
[17:40:17] <iamjarvo> aaronmcadam:  the prefixes work on not on table elements
[17:41:34] <imsky> ti ti ti ta ti ti ti ta
[17:42:49] <Whirl3d> If I put an image in a jquery object and then store that object in the original image's parent object, I can remove the image from the dom and reattach it from the data object later, correct?
[17:43:12] <Whirl3d> *parent's data object...srry
[17:43:50] <Whirl3d> but while an element is detached from the dom, doescan you get it's width/height?
[17:44:40] <Whirl3d> ??sorry dont' know how that came out. I meant can you get the height and width of a detatched element?
[17:44:43] <Atty> is there a jquery for a select box?
[17:46:49] <aaronmcadam> Atty: there's a jQuery for everyone
[17:47:30] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: that's a good question
[17:47:55] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: I'd imagine there would be computedStyle for a detached element
[17:48:07] <aaronmcadam> but for an *un*attached one I'd say no
[17:48:21] <aaronmcadam> so if the element has been rendered
[17:48:30] <aaronmcadam> you could cache the dimensions easily yeah
[17:48:55] <Atty> so what do I need to do to basically dress up this select list
[17:49:02] <aaronmcadam> dress up?
[17:49:09] <aaronmcadam> in what? drag?
[17:49:14] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I was just trying to decide if I needed to do that or if i could evluate it when it was needed
[17:49:35] <Whirl3d> Thnks for the reply. Cache it is..
[17:49:41] <aaronmcadam> cool man
[17:49:49] <aaronmcadam> you *may* not need to do it that way tho
[17:49:51] <Atty> well I came to get some help not to be made fun of
[17:50:13] <aaronmcadam> sorry ur just not explaining  yourself very well
[17:50:32] <Atty> i have a form
[17:50:43] <aaronmcadam> you want to attach an event to a select's options changing?
[17:50:53] <Atty> with a drop down menu or list that I want to dress up
[17:51:03] <Atty> I been using the jqueryui
[17:51:05] <aaronmcadam> what do u mean dress up
[17:51:13] <aaronmcadam> exactly
[17:51:18] <aaronmcadam> what do u want to do to the select
[17:51:30] <Atty> ok so I have a multiselect field I used some jquery with
[17:51:33] <aaronmcadam> rather than just enhance it in some undefined way
[17:51:39] <Atty> and it looks great nice css
[17:51:50] <Atty> and I also have a datepicker on the same form
[17:52:04] <Atty> i just thought I could make my drop downs look the same is all.
[17:52:21] <aaronmcadam> Atty: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[17:52:46] <Atty> exactly what Im looking for thanks adam
[17:52:51] <aaronmcadam> cool man
[17:53:05] <aaronmcadam> it makes selects super useful
[17:53:55] <Atty> can I use it with the ui?
[17:54:13] <aaronmcadam> nothing stopping u
[17:54:33] <aaronmcadam> does ui enhance forms? never tried
[17:54:44] <aaronmcadam> shouldn't conflict
[17:54:59] <aaronmcadam> as in selects I meant
[17:55:06] <Atty> ok
[17:55:17] <Atty> im new to the jquery and javascript
[17:55:23] <aaronmcadam> oik
[17:55:35] <Atty> my background is mainly in SQL DB and CF
[17:55:58] <Atty> but the jquery made my form pimp so i been looking info it
[17:56:06] <aaronmcadam> Cold Fusion?
[17:56:08] <aaronmcadam> god man
[17:57:14] <Atty> yes coldfusion
[17:57:37] <Whirl3d> I have a series of inline anchor elements that when moused over a little popup image appears near it.the image src is determined by the anchor's href attribute. I am preloading all of these images and not attaching them to the dom, but rather just storing them in the anchor element's data object.
[17:58:22] <aaronmcadam> storing them?
[17:58:30] <aaronmcadam> you're not preloading them properly
[17:58:44] <aaronmcadam> how are you preloading?
[17:58:53] <aaronmcadam> using `new Image()`?
[17:58:59] <Whirl3d> yeah
[17:59:28] <Whirl3d> and then attaching a load handler to either store the image in the anchor element's data object or to disable the anchor on error
[17:59:56] <aaronmcadam> but that's only going to be a string
[18:00:17] <aaronmcadam> bit strange storing an actual image object on the data
[18:00:23] <Whirl3d> actually, you can store a jquery object as a data attribute
[18:00:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[18:00:37] <aaronmcadam> I guess, but sounds weird
[18:00:42] <aaronmcadam> just a src is all you'd need
[18:00:53] <Whirl3d> i just figured it would be faster
[18:01:03] <aaronmcadam> faster to attach an object?
[18:01:30] <Whirl3d> yeah. rather than creating one, with a src attribute and waiting for it to load
[18:01:30] <aaronmcadam> faster doesn't really apply here I don't think
[18:01:36] <Whirl3d> I gues snot
[18:01:42] <aaronmcadam> no, that's not how it works really
[18:01:53] <aaronmcadam> if u preload ur images upfront with new Image()
[18:02:10] <aaronmcadam> and then set img.src = preloaded.src
[18:02:19] <aaronmcadam> that's nothing really
[18:02:41] <Whirl3d> so you never attach the image to the dom when you preload it?
[18:03:11] <Whirl3d> I was actually using $("<img>")
[18:03:29] <aaronmcadam> yeah one min
[18:03:39] <Whirl3d> thnx for your help, btw.
[18:04:02] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: https://gist.github.com/2143270
[18:04:22] <aaronmcadam> where imageList is just an array of strings of the img srcs
[18:05:19] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: refresh to see any example of using the function
[18:06:02] <aaronmcadam> I'm gonna shoot now tho cuz it's 1:05am here
[18:06:11] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: hit me on twitter if ur stuck, @aaronmcadam
[18:07:11] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: latest gist: https://gist.github.com/2143270
[18:07:15] <aaronmcadam> cya guys
[18:10:10] <rpg32> i
[18:10:14] <Whirl3d> thanks for your help aaronmcadam, git wouldn't let me in

[18:10:16] <rpg32> hi
[18:10:22] <Whirl3d> I'll catch up with ya later.
[18:10:42] <rpg32> i'm having trouble including jquery-ui-core with my wordpress page
[18:10:56] <rpg32> anyone familiar with doing this?
[18:11:16] <Atty> aaron whatsthis cake stuff im seeing?
[18:11:45] <rpg32> i have jquery working fine, but when i try to apply a bounce effect on an object it doesn't recognize the effect function
[18:12:01] <rpg32> ... effect is part of ui core right?
[18:12:53] <Paradox2000> rpg32: Nope.
[18:13:26] <rpg32> Oh... what is it part of?
[18:13:38] <someprimetime> nice
[18:13:42] <someprimetime> got my tooltip plugin done
[18:13:42] <Paradox2000> rpg32: Look here- http://jqueryui.com/download
[18:13:56] <Paradox2000> rpg32: Scroll down to effects.
[18:14:01] <someprimetime> first pass of course without taking into account it being located near a window
[18:14:44] <rpg32> oh... well that explains it
[18:14:56] <Paradox2000> rpg32: Happy to help :)
[18:15:32] <rpg32> any idea what the best way to incorporate effects with wordpress?
[18:15:41] <rpg32> it looks like they don't include it in their wp
[18:16:00] <rpg32> wp_enqeue_script
[18:18:48] <Paradox2000> rpg32: You should try asking this at the #wordpress channel.
[18:19:02] <rpg32> k
[18:19:05] <rpg32> thx
[18:19:11] <Paradox2000> :)
[18:29:14] <Whirl3d> how do you tell if an image that you have preloaded is attached to the dom or not?
[18:32:29] <ngharo> try selecting it
[18:33:31] <Whirl3d> I decided to check if it's :visible...shouldn't be :visible if it's not attached, right
[18:33:53] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: do jQuery.contains(document, imageElement)
[18:39:54] <yamahaalex37> does anyone use validate.js?
[18:40:32] <yamahaalex37> this one
[18:40:35] <yamahaalex37> bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation
[18:45:42] <yamahaalex37> i cant get password to validate samea s first
[18:45:45] <yamahaalex37> same as first
[18:45:55] <yamahaalex37> $('#formRegister').validate({
[18:45:55] <yamahaalex37> 			rules: {
[18:45:55] <yamahaalex37> 				pass2: {
[18:45:55] <yamahaalex37> 				equalTo: pass1
[18:45:55] <yamahaalex37> 			}
[18:46:11] <someprimetime> ? jsfiddle @ yamahaalex37
[18:46:11] <bot-t1> yamahaalex37, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[18:46:26] <yamahaalex37> amazing, technology these days!
[18:46:51] <someprimetime> someone is much more likely to help if you provide a jsfiddle
[18:47:06] <yamahaalex37> im just asking if anyone knows about that
[18:47:37] <someprimetime> knows about what?
[18:47:58] <someprimetime> "i cant get password to validate samea s first"
[18:48:08] <Zackington> does anyone know how to access the darknet?
[18:48:18] <yamahaalex37> nvm i got it
[18:48:34] <someprimetime> how about if ($('#pass1').val() !== $('#pass2').val()) {}
[18:48:45] <someprimetime> i don't use validate.js though
[18:50:19] <yamahaalex37> yeah
[18:50:23] <yamahaalex37> do you use any script?
[18:50:32] <someprimetime> yes. javascript
[18:50:43] <yamahaalex37> javascript is a language
[18:50:50] <someprimetime> and that's the only "script" i use
[18:50:59] <yamahaalex37> language != script
[18:51:04] <yamahaalex37> its ok, the name is decieving
[18:51:05] <someprimetime> i never said it was a language
[18:51:06] <someprimetime> you did
[18:51:10] <yamahaalex37> youll get it someday
[18:51:24] <someprimetime> right.
[18:51:34] <yamahaalex37> you said it was a script
[18:51:40] <yamahaalex37> a script is scriptName.js
[18:51:40] <someprimetime> i was being facetious
[18:51:43] <yamahaalex37> javascript is not a scriptj
[18:51:44] <someprimetime> get a clue
[18:51:45] <yamahaalex37> k
[18:52:56] <yamahaalex37> this is one of the rules
[18:52:56] <yamahaalex37> equalTo: "#pass1"
[18:53:05] <yamahaalex37> i wonder if I can do equalTo: !string
[18:53:15] <yamahaalex37> to make sure its not equal too..
[18:56:36] <Whirl3d> is there an easy trick to positioning an element so that it's edges are within it's parents edges or the viewport, which ever is smaller?
[18:57:18] <someprimetime> get the parent container's width and position it relatively to the .top and .left position of it?
[18:57:45] <someprimetime> actually you'd only need its position, i believe
[18:57:56] <Whirl3d> yeah. I can do the math, I was just wondering if there were any slick "tricks" that I should know about...
[18:58:03] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reply, someprimetime.
[18:58:44] <someprimetime> hmm not sure tbh.. i just did something kind of similar for a tooltip plugin though if you want to see what i did: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/hvP4d/8/
[18:59:07] <ndss56> Whirl3d: how to create a link that looks like a button?
[18:59:22] <Whirl3d> Its funny how you can spend some time developing a "thing" and then realize suddenly that it'sjust like another "thing" I just realized I've been making a glorified tooltip all day.
[18:59:37] <Whirl3d> what a weird thing that I didn't think about it that way until just now.
[18:59:40] <someprimetime> lol
[19:00:18] <Whirl3d> I am actually highlighting some words in a story and creating little popup images to illustrate the words on mouse over or touch.
[19:00:29] <someprimetime> oh cool
[19:00:37] <yamahaalex37> if($('#pass1').val('Password')){alert
[19:00:44] <Whirl3d> just like a tooltip, but I was going about it all differently
[19:00:45] <yamahaalex37> will that check if the inputbox's value is value
[19:00:49] <yamahaalex37> 'Password'
[19:01:06] <someprimetime> feel free to be inspired by that code all you want
[19:01:18] <someprimetime> and if you have any suggestions for me, i'm all ears
[19:01:33] <someprimetime> yamahaalex37: no
[19:01:45] <someprimetime> if ($('#pass1').val() === 'Password') {}
[19:01:52] <yamahaalex37> if($('#pass1').val() == 'Password'){
[19:01:55] <yamahaalex37> k thanks
[19:01:58] <Whirl3d> oh wow, I just read your post. I'm running so slow today. LOL THanks tons I will check it out now
[19:02:02] <yamahaalex37> wow three === were gettin crazy
[19:02:06] <someprimetime> use === to avoid type coercion
[19:02:09] <yamahaalex37> k
[19:03:01] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: that doesn't take into account the position of the text next to the window
[19:03:25] <someprimetime> if it's close to the edges the text will be cutoff by the window constraint
[19:03:32] <someprimetime> but that's trivial to add tbh
[19:04:18] <Whirl3d> I watched someone do this one time with a simple line of CSS that made positioning the elements perfect every time. I should've taken notes. It was short and elegant...
[19:04:37] <someprimetime> ask oksushi
[19:04:44] <someprimetime> he's pretty godlike with css
[19:05:31] <Whirl3d> yeah, but harsh harsh harsh in #css if I remember correctly. Or many he was the only nice one in there...something like that.
[19:05:56] <yamahaalex37> how can I throw my own error similar to validate.js is
[19:06:17] <Whirl3d> I wish I could get past my hatred of css. It'd be nice to know it. I am always struggling with it.
[19:06:41] <someprimetime> after the initial commitment to learning it, it's a breeze
[19:07:04] <yamahaalex37> dont use css its annoying
[19:07:07] <yamahaalex37> just use tables and stuf
[19:07:59] <someprimetime> can't tell if this guy is trolling or...
[19:08:16] <Whirl3d> I can't tell you how many hundreds of hours I could shave off of nearly every project if I used tables instead of mucking through css because it's the trend or preferred way to do things
[19:08:26] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: it's not a trend
[19:08:35] <someprimetime> it's just semantically better to use
[19:08:35] <Whirl3d> (just being bitter)
[19:09:22] <Whirl3d> when you say semantically, you mean because it is easier for the browser to digest or easier to see what's going on behind the scenes?
[19:09:28] <yamahaalex37> this did not work
[19:09:29] <yamahaalex37> $('#pass1').after('<label for="pass1" generated="true" class="error">Maybe you should pick a password...</label>');
[19:10:23] <yamahaalex37> but the alert im throwing in the same function is working
[19:11:10] <yamahaalex37> nvm
[19:11:12] <yamahaalex37> copied wrong file
[19:11:37] <xp_prg2>  $("table[id$='_tbl_data'] tr:nth-of-type(even)") ie 9 says nth-of-type unrecognized
[19:11:53] <xp_prg2> what can I put instead of nth-of-type?
[19:11:55] <xp_prg2> can I put :even?
[19:12:42] <xp_prg2> yup that owrks
[19:17:09] <Atty> hey the combobox in IE doesnt display right
[19:17:13] <Atty> any ideas?
[19:17:47] <drale2k> what's the difference between calling document.ready and jQuery(function .. ) ?
[19:18:44] <someprimetime> $(function() {}); is the same as $(document).ready(function() {});
[19:18:45] <someprimetime> it's just shorthand.
[19:21:51] <drale2k> someprimetime: so jQuery() will also wait for the DOM to load?
[19:22:22] <someprimetime> yes, but if you want to wait until all images are loaded use $(window).ready(function() {});
[19:22:41] <someprimetime> drale2k: jQuery(function() {}); that is
[19:23:07] <drale2k> someprimetime: are you sure about (window) waiting for assets?
[19:23:15] <someprimetime> drale2k: yes i'm sure.
[19:23:25] <Atty> hey is bugs.jquery.com down?
[19:24:00] <someprimetime> also call your javascript last right before your closing </body> tag
[19:27:13] <drale2k> someprimetime: my problem with the assets is that they come in async
[19:27:54] <someprimetime> what is the entire problem?
[19:29:05] <drale2k> someprimetime: i just wanted to know about jQuery and document.ready
[19:29:09] <drale2k> so thanks
[19:29:19] <someprimetime> ah np
[19:32:48] <Murugaratham> is it possible for $.getJSON to pass complex objects to webservice
[20:12:02] <j0rd> I've got this problem with jquery. <img width="100" height="100" style="width:50px;height50px"
[20:12:16] <j0rd> how can I get the "width=100" in jquery before 1.6
[20:12:29] <imsky> $("img").attr("width")
[20:12:32] <j0rd> I assume this is what the new .prop method is for
[20:12:41] <j0rd> imsky attr("width") will be 50
[20:12:51] <imsky> say what now
[20:13:42] <j0rd> imsky attr i believe is the calculated attribute, so if the CSS makes it 50px and it's 50px when you see it in html, you'll get 50px
[20:13:59] <j0rd> imsky: which I believe is why .prop was added in JQ 1.6
[20:14:05] <imsky> oh that's what's up
[20:14:18] <j0rd> but I can't use JQ 1.6 only 1.5
[20:14:29] <j0rd> so, I ask again, how do I get my "width"
[20:14:46] <Eviltwin> j0rd: You probably need to use the DOM method
[20:14:46] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/P9nNM/
[20:14:54] <imsky> $("img")[0].attributes.width
[20:14:56] <j0rd> also I can't use $("img").load either, since it doesn't work well enough
[20:15:06] <j0rd> Eviltwin: thx :)
[20:17:19] <j0rd> works :)
[20:17:27] <j0rd> makes my code a tonne simpler now :)
[20:46:06] <Hawkee> suppose I have an onclick calling a function, is there a way to identify the link from within?
[20:46:11] <Hawkee> like $.caller
[20:51:04] <Hawkee> I just passed this and did jQuery(this)
[20:52:27] <Eviltwin> Well first, don't use onclick="" especially when you have access to jQuery's .on etc.
[20:52:49] <xp_prg2> I was surprised to see that certain jquery selectors broke in ie 7
[20:52:58] <xp_prg2> I had to refactor them
[20:55:50] <Eviltwin> xp_prg2: Like what?
[20:56:11] <xp_prg2> 'form#myid #fieldid'
[20:56:34] <xp_prg2> I had to turn it into: "form#myid input[id='fieldid']"
[20:59:46] <zfly9> Hey guys I really don't know much about how jquery works, but my site is calling 1.6.1 and I have this slider that uses jquery that works fine with it.. I then attempted to put it some jquery on another page and the tutorial had me implement and call jquery-1.2.3.pack.js ... I got that working just fine but the other plugin stops working.. If I take out that call for jquery-1.2.3.pack.js, then it works, but the other plugin doesn't.. Any
[21:00:02] <zfly9> Is there something that calls a particular version or something?
[21:01:34] <NaOH> does anyone know why bloo() isn't getting called on mouseover? http://pastebin.com/2UUqxEex
[21:01:36] <amirite> how do i get all attributes
[21:01:45] <amirite> is that a javascript question or a jquery question
[21:02:17] <dr0id> that's a #defocus question
[21:03:06] <zfly9> Really, no one? I know I'm a noob to this, but I could really use the help
[21:03:48] <coldhead> zfly9: you're going to have to let go of jquery 1.2.3
[21:03:55] <coldhead> that is from last century
[21:04:02] <zfly9> ok haha
[21:04:06] <zfly9> thanks
[21:04:10] <coldhead> and then you are going to have to fix whatever was depending on that version to use a modern jquery
[21:04:20] <coldhead> it can be done!
[21:04:22] <coldhead> you can do it!
[21:04:39] <zfly9> Really can't, trying to get by with plug and play, no clue about jquery, agh
[21:06:17] <zfly9> coldhead, you busy? ;)
[21:07:50] <zfly9> this is all that's in the js http://pastebin.com/i8PVeXbU
[21:09:54] <coldhead> i am busy sorry zfly9
[21:09:59] <coldhead> got this CEO and shit
[21:10:07] <zfly9> ok thanks anyway coldhead
[21:10:12] <coldhead> zfly9: if you must be lazy, can you try using a different plugin?
[21:10:18] <coldhead> not this 1900s one
[21:10:33] <coldhead> jQuery isn't that hard if you do have to learn it
[21:10:38] <coldhead> look at these hundreds of idiots
[21:10:44] <coldhead> they're none of them brain surgeons
[21:11:03] <zfly9> would changing $(function() to jquery(function() fix issues?
[21:11:11] <zfly9> i just googled an error and that was a suggestion
[21:11:32] <coldhead> oh
[21:11:42] <coldhead> well yes you kind of CAN use two different jquery versions
[21:12:00] <coldhead> here are the instructions http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
[21:12:10] <coldhead> it is a terrible idea and you're fired if you do it
[21:12:15] <coldhead> but it's a matter for yourself
[21:12:35] <zfly9> looks like what I just said fixed it!
[21:12:43] <coldhead> then you sir are a genius
[21:12:44] <coldhead> well done
[21:12:45] <coldhead> ?cc
[21:12:46] <bot-t1> CASE CLOASED >: |
[21:16:14] <Eviltwin> xp_prg2: Is the ID "fieldid" duplicated on the page?
[21:16:20] <zfly9> fuck
[21:16:36] <zfly9> open case please, that didn't fix it, I just accidently readded the call to the old juery
[21:18:15] <xp_prg2> it is identical in different forms though
[21:18:45] <zfly9> If someoen can look at my patebin I'd appreciate it
[21:22:39] <coldhead> zfly9: did you look at the link about jQuery and other libs?
[21:22:48] <coldhead> that will help you help yourself
[21:22:50] <coldhead> and jesus loves that
[21:22:56] <coldhead> apparently
[21:23:13] <zfly9> sorry ended up changing every $ to jQuery and it took
[21:23:20] <ASUChander> If I have a param dictionary like this { a: [1,2,3] } is there a way I can get jquery to urlencode it like this: a=1&a=2&a=3 ?
[21:23:52] <Eviltwin> xp_prg2: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.5.2
[21:24:09] <Eviltwin> "This attribute assigns a name to an element. This name must be unique in a document."
[21:24:27] <coldhead> ?param @ ASUChander
[21:24:28] <bot-t1> ASUChander, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[21:24:41] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Not sure that works directly for what he's asking
[21:24:48] <ASUChander> Looks like right now it does this a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3
[21:24:53] <coldhead> I'M NOT SURE YOUR FACE, EVILTWIN
[21:24:56] <coldhead> I'M NOT SURE AT ALL
[21:25:08] <Eviltwin> It does this instead: a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3
[21:25:12] <ASUChander> coldhead: that's $.param
[21:25:32] <coldhead> sorry ASUChander, it's my first day using jQuery
[21:25:39] <ASUChander> :-)
[21:25:44] <Eviltwin> ASUChander: Do you have a mixture or are all of the values arrays?
[21:25:49] <ASUChander> It's a mix
[21:26:00] <Eviltwin> Are there any arrays of arrays as values?
[21:26:05] <ASUChander> I could regex out the []'s I suppose, but I'd rather not.
[21:26:05] <ASUChander> no
[21:26:28] <ASUChander> no arrays of arrays Eviltwin
[21:30:53] <coldhead> why does indexOf return -1 instead of null or undefined
[21:31:00] <coldhead> this is the worst javascript ever
[21:31:08] <ASUChander> 'cause -1 is easier to work with, I think
[21:33:14] <Eviltwin> ?eval $.param($.map({"a":[1,2,3],"b":3}, function(v, k) { return ($.type(v) === "array") ? $.map(v, function(v, _) { return {name: k, value: v} }) : {name: k, value: v} }))
[21:33:19] <bot-t1> Eviltwin: ""
[21:33:25] <Eviltwin> Okay, that's not quite right
[21:33:39] <Eviltwin> ?eval ($.param($.map({"a":[1,2,3],"b":3}, function(v, k) { return ($.type(v) === "array") ? $.map(v, function(v) { return {name: k, value: v} }) : {name: k, value: v} })))
[21:33:39] <bot-t1> Eviltwin: ""
[21:33:45] <Eviltwin> It's working in the browser
[21:34:11] <unseensoul> Hi
[21:34:16] <ASUChander> wow.thnks.
[21:34:18] <ASUChander> thanks
[21:35:09] <bbeck> when writing a jquery plugin is there any way to get a hook on any dom elements that have had a .on called on them?  I'm defining a new type of event, and I'd like to know which elements have a registered handler for it
[21:36:07] <unseensoul> How can I pass a function with arguments to the .on() method?
[21:37:12] <Eviltwin> bbeck: I don't think there's any global location with all the event handlers
[21:37:31] <Eviltwin> unseensoul: Use closure
[21:37:53] <coldhead> i wonder why bot-t handled it differenty
[21:38:18] <unseensoul> Eviltwin, it is going to be a function which will be used again so I do not want to repeat code :S
[21:38:32] <unseensoul> s//in the script
[21:38:42] <Eviltwin> unseensoul: So you'd rather it...not work?
[21:39:09] <bbeck> eviltwin: i guess ideally i'd like only handlers for my new event.  i'm trying to write a plugin that can detect when a dom element is moved around on the page.  so I'd like to do something like $("div#foo").on("move", handler).  but I don't know which elements in the plugin that I have to watch.  is there some way for it to get notified whenever a .on("move", ...) is called?
[21:41:18] <unseensoul> Eviltwin, what do you mean? For instance, say I have a function called max which takes 2 arguments. If I do $(sel).on('click', max) I am not passing any arguments to it. Is there a way I could pass the arguments without calling the function?
[21:41:19] <Eviltwin> bbeck: That's not really how .on is supposed to work
[21:41:39] <Eviltwin> bbeck: Do something like $("div#foo").myplugin("onmove", handler) instead
[21:41:43] <Eviltwin> If that's what you're trying to do
[21:42:03] <Eviltwin> unseensoul: It's called an anonymous function or closure
[21:42:18] <bbeck> Eviltwin: ok, i'll give that a shot.  thanks for the advice
[21:43:24] <Eviltwin> unseensoul: $("#div").click(function() { foo("bar", "xyz"); }) will run foo("bar", "xyz") when #div is clicked
[21:44:24] <unseensoul> Eviltwin, yes, that is what I was looking for. Thanks, I was not getting what I meant earlier on :)
[21:44:35] <unseensoul> s/I/you
[22:17:51] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, here is a project that I am going to finish tonight. Before I get too far into it, I just wanted you to read my goals and approach to see if you would do something different. No work on your part, just your opinion...
[22:18:40] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2YzMe/1/
[22:19:28] <Whirl3d> actually, anyone who wants to offer up some advice (other than use a plugin...), I'd love to hear it.
[22:19:35] <coldhead> oh no, you asked Eviltwin
[22:19:44] <coldhead> we wouldn't dream of interfering
[22:20:48] <Whirl3d> I figure there are a million paths that lead to the top of the mountain, so if someone knows a quicker one that offers more enlightenment, I'm all for it.
[22:30:39] <Whirl3d> It'll take forever if I go by inertia. hmmm
[22:48:34] <Whirl3d> coldhead, you boob. I just reread your comment. LOL I asked EvilTwin cause I told him he should write a book where I would make a project and he'd come back and re-do the project in about 3 lines of code (compared to the 3 to 5 mb of text it would take me. LOL
[22:49:09] <coldhead> i understand
[22:49:13] <coldhead> i don't want to get in the way
[22:49:16] <coldhead> with my ignorance
[22:49:38] <Whirl3d> you crack me up. considering it's your first day and all.
[22:49:55] <coldhead> exactly, IGNORANCE
[22:50:48] <systemfault> Hmm...
[22:51:13] <systemfault> coldhead... it's his first day here.... everyday
[22:51:41] <Whirl3d> how delightfully zen that is
[22:52:27] <gloomer> Whirl3d, your project seems interesting what have you got so far?
[22:53:30] <Whirl3d> Gimme just a second and I'll update the fiddle.
[22:54:04] <gloomer> I have an idea of how I would do it.
[22:54:20] <gloomer> using tags like you mentioned in comments
[23:11:05] <Whirl3d> gloomer, sorry, I had someone show up at my house unannounced. I just pasted my first run at the code...haven't checked it (or spell checked it or anything). but here it is:
[23:11:17] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2YzMe/3/
[23:13:14] <Whirl3d> pfew, all kinds o errors there.
[23:36:26] <Whirl3d> so now I have decided that it is reasonable to isolate the "showContextImage and "hideContextImage" functions (rahter than keep them anonymous) because there are too many coniditional states to account for in either function.
[23:37:28] <donnax> hey which plugin would you suggest for image manipulation and analysis?
[23:39:25] <css> analysis?
[23:39:26] <css> that's vague
[23:42:29] <donnax> like if i want to take pixel values
[23:43:53] <coldhead> donnax: http://www.pixastic.com/lib/
[23:44:13] <donnax> oh thanks
[23:45:44] <coldhead> that's the 1st search result for "jquery image processing"
[23:45:55] <coldhead> i have also used it before though :P
[23:53:46] <kakarlus> hi
[23:54:35] <kakarlus> $(this).parent() <--- im looking for a child in the parent referenced using an index
[23:54:43] <kakarlus> how can i do it
[23:54:59] <kakarlus> $(this).parent()[index] doesnot work
[23:55:25] <Cork> ?.children @ kakarlus
[23:55:25] <bot-t> kakarlus, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[23:55:48] <Cork> so $(this).parent().children().eq(index)
[23:56:52] <Whirl3d> or $(this).siblings().eq(index);
[23:57:16] <Cork> siblings might calculate wrong though (as it doesn't include it self)
[23:57:59] <Whirl3d> but that shouldn't affect the index value should it?
[23:58:13] <Cork> it does
[23:58:22] <Cork> thats just a reference to the jquery internal array
[23:58:27] <Cork> not its position in the dom
[23:58:35] <Whirl3d> in other words, $(this).sliblings().eq(5) will be the same as $(".myclass").eq(5) even if I am 4, right?
[23:58:45] <Cork> no
[23:58:51] <Whirl3d> Cool. Good to know
