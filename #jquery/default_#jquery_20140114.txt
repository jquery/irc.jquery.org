[00:00:03] <jphase> $(this).width()
[00:00:04] <jphase> type thing
[00:00:20] <limpc> but theres 32 of them
[00:00:34] <jphase> hmm
[00:01:06] <jphase> this part is a bit of gray area for me honestly, I'd have to play around with loading the element and binding the .load event to the element as it's created
[00:01:13] <jphase> hard to say
[00:01:46] <jphase> I do this stuff with my wysiwyg plugin but I haven't really calculated width or height or any render params with those
[00:02:46] <jphase> this particular issue might be > jphase as I haven't done this yet in a plugin wrapper. Cork would be a good person to ask, or Velveeta
[00:02:51] <jphase> both frequent this chan
[00:03:29] <Cork> hmm?
[00:03:43] <limpc> yeah. ok thanks for pointing me in the general direction. I think i know what i need to do
[00:04:04] <limpc> probably need to count all images in my element, set a counter, and bind .load() to each image and trigger an execute when all images get loaded.
[00:04:23] <limpc> though what im reading on jquery's docs, is .load() isnt exactly reliable cross browser :/
[00:04:40] <jphase> hey Cork, you mind checking out limpc's issue? it's in a plugin wrapper called on .load and he can't get .width.   http://r.profferlabs.com/scroll/js/sgScroller3.js  is his plugin, view-source:http://r.profferlabs.com/scroll/ is his src, view-source:http://r.profferlabs.com/scroll/ is his call
[00:05:34] <jphase> sorry for the view-source links :x
[00:07:03] <Cork> wheres the width call?
[00:07:08] <Cork> ah there
[00:07:38] <limpc> i think i know the problem actually. i bet its because im cloning the ul element and removing the original
[00:07:54] <limpc> so technically the images arent loaded yet even though they did previously
[00:08:19] <Cork> the itm is refering to dom that isn't in the document
[00:08:34] <Cork> so as it isn't visible it has no dimensions
[00:08:48] <limpc> this.elem?
[00:09:11] <Cork> yes
[00:09:22] <Cork> if you put a breakpoint on the console.log
[00:09:30] <Cork> and the check the dom element it references
[00:09:38] <Cork> it is not in the page
[00:10:04] <Elirips> Hello. Is there any event I can connect to that tells me when an element really becomes visible?
[00:10:27] <Elirips> And with "really" I mean, not only the display property of that element is set to something that shows it, but also its parent element(s)
[00:10:56] <ravenzz> you can use observers
[00:10:58] <ravenzz> maybe
[00:11:35] <Cork> except it isn't cross browser
[00:11:53] <ravenzz> or extend show() and the like to fire an event when it finishes
[00:12:49] <Cork> limpc: found it
[00:13:03] <Cork> limpc: line 48 in sgScroller3
[00:13:09] <Cork> it parses the html you stored
[00:13:13] <Cork> and then try to handle it
[00:13:23] <Cork> instead of the content you actually added to the page
[00:13:26] <limpc> yeah i just realized that,
[00:13:37] <limpc> :)
[00:14:17] <limpc> thanks!
[00:14:20] <Cork> np
[00:16:46] <Amnesia> question, I've cloned a table row using jquery, but when the kloon eventually gets removed, the original row's buttons icons dissappear
[00:16:54] <Amnesia> does this sound familiar to anyone?
[00:17:11] <Cork> Amnesia: code please
[00:17:25] <Amnesia> Cork: uno momento
[00:17:38] <Cork> and no if you made a full clone and remove the clone based of reference it shouldn't happen
[00:17:58] * jphase is happy he awoke Cork and goes back to hiding in the shadows :)
[00:18:12] <Cork> jphase: you didn't really :)
[00:18:17] <Cork> i got in a few mins earlier
[00:18:23] <jphase> hey give me SOME credit now! heh
[00:18:25] <Cork> started late today ^^
[00:18:29] <Cork> heh
[00:18:29] <jphase> touché
[00:18:56] <Amnesia> Cork: https://privatepaste.com/7e41ee105e
[00:19:02] <Amnesia> the icons get assigned as follows
[00:19:31] <Amnesia> https://privatepaste.com/94cf4cc1b0
[00:19:57] <limpc> theres another pastebin? geez :)
[00:20:09] <jphase> limpc: my fav is paste.ofcode.org
[00:20:11] <Amnesia> limpc: there're tons of them:)
[00:20:15] <jphase> best syntax highlighting imo
[00:20:22] <Cork> Amnesia: $("#myTable tr").length sounds unsafe
[00:20:34] <Cork> Amnesia: if you click clone, then remove
[00:20:41] <Cork> and then clone again (of the last row)
[00:20:46] <Cork> you will have two elements with the same id
[00:20:51] <Cork> actually
[00:20:55] <limpc> good to have, for those times when pastebin is acting like a snail on a salt lick.
[00:20:56] <Cork> if you ever click remove
[00:20:59] <Cork> you will have id problems
[00:21:06] <Amnesia> this.id = (rowID + "_clone_" + tableLength); changes the id
[00:21:11] <Cork> sure
[00:21:16] <Cork> but length = 6
[00:21:23] <Cork> remove length = 5
[00:21:29] <jphase> limpc: and if you're in a hurry, hastebin.com is pretty dopesauce - automatic syntax highlighting but it doesn't always work like it should :\
[00:21:32] <Cork> clone length 6 again
[00:21:40] <Cork> if you don't remove the last element you will have duplicates
[00:21:56] <Amnesia> so how'd you do it?
[00:21:57] <Cork> it's better to just have a dumb counter
[00:22:03] <limpc> oohh i like that one
[00:22:08] <Amnesia> I though I'd take the length of the table to make sure no duplicates could occure
[00:22:14] * limpc bookmarks
[00:22:38] <Cork> var id = 0; .clone().attr("id", "rowID + "_clone_" + (+id));
[00:22:46] <limpc> http://hastebin.com/vareninire.coffee awesomeness in a tin can.
[00:22:56] <Cork> Amnesia: but length isn't unique
[00:23:04] <Cork> if you support remove that is
[00:23:29] <Amnesia> what about: var i = 0; this.id = (rowID + "_clone_" + (i += 1));
[00:23:46] <Cork> well the loop isn't needed
[00:23:55] <jphase> limpc: yeah you can tell what it "thinks" it should be by the faux extension at the end of the URL. You'll see like .apache for vhost configs and such
[00:23:57] <Amnesia> loop?
[00:23:57] <Cork> your working with an id
[00:24:01] <Cork> .each()
[00:24:22] <limpc> jphase: ahh so thats where the .coffee came from. I thought it was just a random dictionary word.  cool!
[00:24:30] <Amnesia> hm ok
[00:24:40] <Cork> $("#" + rowID).clone().attr('id', rowID + '_clone_' + (++id)).appendTo("#myTable");
[00:24:51] <Amnesia> ty
[00:25:55] <Amnesia> is there some way to get that to traverse multiple lines?
[00:26:05] <Cork> what do you mean?
[00:26:25] <Cork> id is unique
[00:26:30] <Cork> so it can't ever be more then one element
[00:26:41] <Amnesia> well, now the line's really long, I'd like to chop it up in to lines, to get it to traverse 2 lines in the source code
[00:26:49] <Amnesia> e.g. implement a new line char
[00:26:52] <Cork> ah
[00:26:53] <Amnesia> just for readability
[00:26:59] <Cork> you can split it like you do with any js
[00:27:09] <Cork> space is insignificant except in the strings
[00:27:56] <Amnesia> hm ok
[00:27:56] <Amnesia> ty
[00:28:02] <Amnesia> let me try this out:)
[00:28:44] <Cork> Amnesia: http://jsfiddle.net/NvaBW/
[00:29:05] <Cork> (excessive i know but to prove the point :) )
[00:30:02] <Amnesia> ty:P
[00:30:17] <Amnesia> hm, it's not working yet, I'll try and debug a bit:)
[00:30:29] <Amnesia> but you're right, I was using the table length of a row, instead of the entire table...
[00:30:47] <Amnesia> which obviously isn't unique
[00:31:31] <Amnesia> Cork: the same is occuring:/
[00:31:32] <Amnesia> I'll send you a screenshot
[00:31:39] <Cork> no screenshot...
[00:31:48] <Cork> if you need help make a demo
[00:31:54] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[00:32:09] <Amnesia> hm, sure but that will take a little bit longer^
[00:32:12] <Amnesia> ^^
[00:32:23] <Cork> ya, i know
[00:32:31] <Cork> but i ask for a demo for two reasons
[00:32:46] <Cork> 1. you have a good chance of finding the problem your self as your construct the example
[00:33:01] <Cork> 2. an image can't be debugged so it is close to pointless
[00:33:21] <Cork> 3. jsfiddlen.net cause it makes it easy to give you back a working change
[00:33:24] <Amnesia> https://privatepaste.com/680681d57a is actually correct right?
[00:34:02] <Cork> oh no
[00:34:13] <Cork> var id = 0; needs to be outside the click handler
[00:34:18] <Cork> else it will always be 1
[00:34:34] <Amnesia> ugh
[00:34:39] <Amnesia> <- fail
[00:35:00] <Amnesia> anyway, the icons are still disappearing:P
[00:35:28] <Amnesia> but apart of the assignment of id everything's fine right? I didn't misinterpret something?
[00:36:21] <Cork> Amnesia: well i've only seen the js so can only guess
[00:36:26] <Cork> but yes it looked ok
[00:36:30] <Amnesia> ok:)
[00:37:08] <Amnesia> I'm somehow going to try and make a mockup
[00:38:36] <fabioportieri> o/
[00:39:30] <Cork> ~~~~~~\o
[00:54:02] <Amnesia> Cork: is it correct that jsfiddle doesn't support jquery ui?
[00:54:08] <paulvd> anyone knows of a carousel which accepts html too, something like this http://www.bkosborne.com/jquery-waterwheel-carousel
[00:54:09] <Cork> no
[00:54:26] <Cork> Amnesia: but it only offers it for some jquery versions
[00:54:33] <Amnesia> hm ok
[00:55:05] <Cork> actually all except 1.6.4 and 1.10.1
[00:55:28] <Cork> though you can include them through the external resources for those too
[00:55:41] <Cork> but then you need to find the links your self
[00:56:02] <Amnesia> hm ok
[00:57:27] <Amnesia> ffs, it isn't saving-.-
[00:57:50] <Cork> the save button doens't work?
[00:58:07] <Amnesia> http://jsfiddle.net/9cu8H/
[00:58:14] <Amnesia> my bad:)
[00:58:23] <Cork> ah
[00:58:45] <Amnesia> don't know btw why the icons aren't showing..
[00:59:19] <Amnesia> the way my application does it, it using a seperate js script
[00:59:55] <Amnesia> but since jsfiddle only allows one js script, I did it in the same script as the $("button#clone") part
[00:59:57] <Cork> Amnesia: uh, both save and delete is a submit button
[01:00:01] <seutje> add the libraries http://jsfiddle.net/9cu8H/3/
[01:00:02] <Cork> are you sure it should be?
[01:00:13] <Amnesia> hm yep
[01:00:19] <Amnesia> save isn't really relevant in this context
[01:00:21] <Amnesia> I'll remove it
[01:00:50] <Cork> also remember that the button plugin doens't survive clone
[01:01:06] <Cork> you need to clean up after it and run .button() again on the clone
[01:02:04] <Amnesia> "the button plugin" == the jquery ui icons?
[01:02:10] <Cork> and $("button#clone") will only work for one button
[01:02:22] <Amnesia> cause you are right, stuff breaks when clone() has been executed
[01:02:24] <Cork> well that and the button theming
[01:02:34] <Amnesia> that's the entire issue here^^
[01:03:02] <Amnesia> what exactly should I clean up?
[01:03:12] <Cork> also never do button#clone
[01:03:22] <Cork> "#clone" is enough
[01:03:31] <Cork> no need to first select all buttons in the page
[01:03:37] <Cork> and then filter the one with the id
[01:03:46] <Cork> when the id will always be unique
[01:04:05] <Cork> Amnesia: well .button adds elements in the button
[01:04:11] <Cork> and it adds classes on the button
[01:04:18] <Cork> all of that needs to be removed manually
[01:04:35] <Cork> basically you need to restore the element to how it is by default (before .button)
[01:05:08] <Amnesia> what are you referring to with ".button" ?
[01:05:22] <Cork> $("button.save").button({
[01:05:24] <Cork> for example
[01:05:38] <Amnesia> $("button.delete").button?
[01:05:42] <Amnesia> ah ok
[01:06:25] <Cork> also your tr doesn't have any id, so it won't ever work
[01:06:37] <Cork> btw, out of curiosity
[01:06:45] <Cork> why are you using idn at all on the tr?
[01:06:48] <Cork> not sure you need them
[01:07:00] <Amnesia> ah forgot that in the mockup, sorry
[01:07:23] <Amnesia> idn?
[01:07:39] <Cork> attr('id', rowID + '_clone_' + (++id))
[01:07:49] <Cork> i don't think you need id on the tr at all
[01:07:51] <Amnesia> (beware I'm a total noob at webdev^^, so most likely it's something I haven't really thought about)
[01:08:38] <Amnesia> I guess "attr(rowID + '_clone_' + (++id))" should be sufficient
[01:08:47] <Cork> no your missing the point
[01:09:03] <xec> you're*
[01:09:16] <xec> hi, cork *hug* :)
[01:10:01] * xec ducks down behind the bushes again
[01:11:45] <Amnesia> so why exactly do the elements of buttons located on the original row change when a clone of the original gets removed?
[01:12:17] <Amnesia> btw, I used an id on the tr in order to "select" that specific row
[01:12:49] <Cork> Amnesia: http://jsfiddle.net/9cu8H/6/
[01:12:56] <Amnesia> I could try and use only .closest('tr') though
[01:13:14] <Cork> opps missed some
[01:15:08] <Amnesia> cloning a clone makes two copies of it:p
[01:15:17] <Amnesia> and delete doesn't seem to work
[01:15:29] <xec> clicking in the text field clones a row? :D
[01:15:41] <xec> because the row gets the class "clone"
[01:16:04] <xec> i think remove therefore will remove *and* add a row :D
[01:16:18] <Amnesia> hm, could be:P
[01:16:44] <Amnesia> but I think Cork's point was to show that .closest(tr) is sufficient
[01:17:01] <xec> yeah
[01:17:01] <Cork> ah
[01:17:02] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/9cu8H/7/
[01:17:04] <Cork> xec: thx
[01:17:17] <Cork> thought i was losing my mind for a min XD
[01:17:21] <Amnesia> heh
[01:18:03] <Cork> i added the class cause i saw that you planed to have a warning when removing a clone
[01:18:30] <Amnesia> question
[01:18:42] <xec> statement
[01:18:56] <Cork> heh
[01:18:57] <Amnesia> why exactly are the ui classes removed when clone has been clicked?
[01:19:15] <Cork> Amnesia: cause i explicitly remove them
[01:19:24] <Cork> Amnesia: but if you mean why you need to run .button again
[01:19:29] <Amnesia> I figure, but why:P?
[01:19:33] <Cork> it's cause it runs on the direct instance
[01:19:44] <Cork> so when you create a new dom element though .clone()
[01:19:50] <Cork> you need to run button on it again
[01:20:06] <Cork> cause it isn't just classes
[01:20:18] <Cork> it is event listeners and so forth too
[01:20:20] <Cork> hmm
[01:20:26] <Cork> that reminds me
[01:20:27] <xec> it would probably be better to make a "create new row" function
[01:20:28] <Cork> wonder if...
[01:20:56] <Amnesia> "run button" what exactly do you mean with that?
[01:21:10] <xec> is there a reason you're cloning instead of just creating a new row?
[01:21:48] <Amnesia> xec: well, it's got to have the same field contents
[01:21:54] <Amnesia> so yep
[01:21:58] <xec> ah, i see
[01:22:23] <Amnesia> most likely it'd still be possible to create a new row, and fetch all the values of the original row, and plant them into the new row
[01:22:24] <xec> well, in that case, maybe just a "create controls" function, and just clone the fields
[01:22:32] <Amnesia> but most likely that's even harder:p
[01:22:53] <Amnesia> I still don't really understand the icon issue though
[01:24:20] <xec> holy crap i must be tired, in my jsfiddle i suddenly got a long row of "e" characters, and i couldn't figure out why for a few seconds. it turns out *my finger was pressing the E key* :(
[01:24:40] <Amnesia> lol
[01:25:03] <Cork> Amnesia: http://jsfiddle.net/9cu8H/8/
[01:26:03] <seutje> xec: them damn low profile keyboards
[01:26:12] <Cork> Amnesia: if you make a clone with the data you don't need to run .button again
[01:26:13] <seutje> the mere weight of your finger is enough
[01:27:01] <xec> seutje: yeah, lol. my finger must have put on some weight lately
[01:27:22] <Cork> Amnesia: hmm no
[01:27:32] <seutje> get some finger weights :D
[01:27:34] <Cork> Amnesia: focus get all wanky if you do it that way :/
[01:28:22] <Cork> Amnesia: you might want to think over if you want to use the .button plugin; just adding the classes and do the rest your self might work better
[01:28:26] <Cork> (it was i usually do)
[01:28:53] <Amnesia> and what do you mean with "the rest" ?
[01:29:21] <xec> adding the <span> elements i guess
[01:29:24] <Cork> Amnesia: well styling on focus
[01:29:31] <Cork> and styling on hover
[01:29:46] <Cork> instead of using .ui-state-hover and .ui-state-focus i use :hover and :active
[01:30:04] <Cork> and yes add the elements needed for the icons
[01:30:09] <Cork> but that can be done statically
[01:30:40] <Amnesia> I'm somehow going to try and glue your solution to my setup^^
[01:30:41] <Cork> i have long thought the solution ui uses for focus and hover is messed up
[01:31:09] <Cork> the browser provides the info in a way where you don't need js
[01:31:17] <Cork> so why go the long way around it?!?
[01:31:34] <xec> yeah i wonder why the opted to add and remove classes instead of just style based on pseudo classes
[01:31:52] <xec> maybe it makes it easier to detect the state of the button in js?
[01:32:09] <Cork> i know they need it form some states
[01:32:19] <Cork> but ya, i find it silly
[01:32:36] <xec> .is(":hover") should work, though?
[01:32:37] <seutje> u can just ignore those classes and make ur own pseudo based CSS
[01:32:46] <Cork> don't think so
[01:32:47] <Cork> but not sure
[01:33:08] <Cork> querySelectorAll doens't work on psudo selectors (at all)
[01:33:17] <Cork> so if it works it would have to be a sizzle thing
[01:34:12] <Amnesia> are we talking 'bout css classes here?
[01:34:29] <Cork> no psudo classes
[01:34:37] <xec> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8981463/detect-if-hovering-over-element-with-jquery#8981521
[01:34:43] <Cork> ?mdn psudo classes
[01:34:45] <b-ot> Cork: Pseudo-classes - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes
[01:34:48] <xec> yeah i'm guessing sizzle
[01:35:12] <paulvd> anyone knows of a sider which accepts html also, something like this one http://www.bkosborne.com/jquery-waterwheel-carousel
[01:39:35] <xec> paulvd:  i assume you mean "slider", http://css-tricks.com/anythingslider-jquery-plugin/
[01:40:32] <Cork> xec: uh... i expected you to keep those terms apart...
[01:40:37] <Cork> slider isn't slideshows...
[01:42:17] <paulvd> i know anything slider, but i want something which looks like this http://www.bkosborne.com/jquery-waterwheel-carousel/options
[01:42:20] <paulvd> or carousel
[01:42:56] <xec> Cork: well, the industry standard word for carousel is "slider", but i know what you mean :(
[01:43:12] <Cork> xec: no the insitru standard is slideshow
[01:43:29] <Cork> a few jquery plugin writers don't know the difference though
[01:43:44] <Cork> *industry
[01:44:00] <Cork> just check the specs
[01:44:23] <xec> what specs?
[01:44:30] <gry> what jquery functions can you recommend for splitting a string variable into lines?
[01:44:38] <Cork> xec: html form slider specs
[01:44:58] <Cork> it isn't for animating images :)
[01:45:05] <xec> of course
[01:45:17] <xec> but there is no spec for carousel, so...
[01:45:20] <Cork> gry: split() ?
[01:45:40] <Cork> xec: well ya, but it wouldn't be called slider
[01:46:04] <Cork> and like i said, the term slider for slideshows/carusells came from jquery plugin writers
[01:46:10] <Cork> so not a standard
[01:46:28] <paulvd> ok can anyone sugges me a carousel/slider then, which looks like that and accepts html as wwell
[01:46:28] <xec> in any case "sider" is incorrect :P
[01:46:34] <Amnesia> Cork: https://privatepaste.com/c2464df67d
[01:46:35] <paulvd> suggest*
[01:46:44] <hellothere> hey yolo brothers :) anyone can tell me how can i do if (ErrorMessage = true) in jquery? i mean what arguments do i need to pass to get if the errormessage is true or not?
[01:46:45] <Amnesia> that boils down to the same as you've got right?
[01:47:18] <Cork> Amnesia: for said reason that won't work
[01:47:28] <Cork> Amnesia: you bind the click event directly on the buttons
[01:47:45] <Amnesia> ah
[01:47:50] <Cork> hmm, actually as you clone with events now it should work
[01:47:51] <frigginCarebear> Amnesia: seems to be a referencing issue, if I destroy them and recreate, it seems to work fine: http://jsfiddle.net/9cu8H/9/
[01:47:58] <limpc> hmm this is probably stupid but i cant seem to get my resize bind to work in my plugin.
[01:48:43] <limpc> sc_listener.bind(this.events.RESIZE, $.proxy(this._resize, this));  and this.events.RESIZE is RESIZE: sgScroller3.prototype.isTouchDevice ? 'orientationchange.' + sgScroller3.prototype.name: 'resize.' + sgScroller3.prototype.name
[01:48:58] <limpc> _resize: function() never fires
[01:49:09] <gry> hellothere: if(ErrorMessage) would already check whether it is true, no?
[01:49:23] <seutje> Amnesia: ok, the each is a bit overkill it seems http://jsfiddle.net/9cu8H/10/
[01:49:41] <Amnesia> I fucking suck at js-.-
[01:49:44] <xec> hellothere: what gry said. also, a single "=" is for assignment, not comparison (you want "===")
[01:49:49] <hellothere> so it goes like if(errormessage) onpagereload else ...
[01:49:51] <Amnesia> can't get my head around it:P
[01:50:04] <hellothere> so i can do if(errormessage == truet
[01:50:14] <seutje> Amnesia: it's probably using an internal reference that is retained after cloning it
[01:50:24] <hellothere> i am just asking if errormessage is already a bool recognized by jquery
[01:50:27] <seutje> and it probably uses that reference to do the focus class thingamajig
[01:50:29] <gry> hellothere: you don't need that for readability. Typos in 'true', typos in '==='...
[01:50:46] <gry> hellothere, the concept is that'd work though it seems.
[01:51:15] <Amnesia> what's the difference between $("myTable").on('clock', '.delete') and $("button.delete") ?
[01:51:24] <xec> hellothere: what? the variable "errormessage" is not going to magically appear, if that's what you're asking?
[01:51:39] <xec> hellothere: what's the context
[01:51:46] <gry> xec: thank you.
[01:51:50] <hellothere> errormessage exists in my jquery
[01:52:10] <seutje> Amnesia: the first is delegated to the table, so there is only 1 event handler bound to the table, which then checks what the target was
[01:52:22] <seutje> if it matches '.delete', it'll call the handler
[01:52:30] <Amnesia> and the second?
[01:52:30] <limpc> Cork: any chance I can get an eyeball on that real quick?
[01:52:47] <Amnesia> btw s/clock/click
[01:52:49] <seutje> Amnesia: the second will bind an event handler to each element that matches 'button.delete'
[01:53:08] <Cork> limpc: resize only fires on the window by default
[01:53:10] <seutje> Amnesia: I assume the last one is missing a .click() and both are missing the function
[01:53:18] <Cork> limpc: for all other elements the event needs to be faked
[01:53:19] <Amnesia> ack
[01:53:24] <seutje> `api on
[01:53:24] <b-ot> seutje: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:55:11] <se-lite> Anyone know if it's possible to manually trigger the jquery droppable "over" event from javascript? (I want it to update the helper on key press)
[01:55:35] <xec> hellothere: sorry but your question doesn't make sense, we need to know more details. where is this code used, and what defines "ErrorMessage"? we can't tell you what it is...
[01:56:00] <Amnesia> hm
[01:56:12] <Amnesia> Cork,xec,seutje thx for your patience ^&^
[01:56:22] <limpc> Cork: ah, ok
[01:56:48] <seutje> Amnesia: thanks for the intrigue :P
[01:56:54] <hellothere> errormessage is defined in asp in the main form, i just wanna do an if errormessage is true then load page
[01:57:26] <seutje> hellothere: as a form element?
[01:59:02] <xec> hellothere: asp is server-side code. you can't access server-side variables on the client without sending it to the client somehow
[01:59:42] <xec> hellothere: if you're asking about asp code you're in the wrong channel
[02:00:07] <hellothere> i am not <: well i got some strings that are produced through some classes
[02:00:12] <Amnesia> hm, does js require you to make function protypes?
[02:00:17] <hellothere> the main function is ErrorMessage and its passed in my jquery
[02:00:23] <Amnesia> (like C)
[02:00:49] <xec> Amnesia: i don't know what that means, so i'm gonna go with "ummm... no?"
[02:00:54] <Cork> Amnesia: protypes?
[02:00:56] <Amnesia> ok:P
[02:01:08] <Amnesia> yeah, say i use func() at the top, and define the function after the use of it
[02:01:22] <xec> Amnesia: it gets hoisted to the top
[02:01:29] <Amnesia> in see you'd be required to add purely the function name + return type & argument at the top
[02:01:31] <limpc> Cork: $('html') should work instead of $(window), yes?
[02:01:33] <Amnesia> okiedo:)
[02:01:39] <Cork> Amnesia: it depends on how you define the function
[02:01:51] <Cork> function <name>() {} is hoisted
[02:01:52] <Amnesia> hm yeah
[02:01:53] <Amnesia> http://jsfiddle.net/9cu8H/10/
[02:01:59] <Cork> var <name> = function() {}; isn't
[02:02:02] <Amnesia> that function definition of makeButtons is completely new to me
[02:02:16] <Amnesia> ty
[02:02:21] <xec> Amnesia: yeah that's actually a function expression
[02:02:36] <xec> Amnesia: but makeButtons() is only called after, so you're fine
[02:03:10] <Amnesia> ty
[02:03:32] <Cork> man my c/c++ is getting rusty...
[02:03:58] <Cork> i know there is a term for that a function needs to be defined before you use it in the parser order
[02:04:03] <Cork> but i don't remember it >_<
[02:04:10] <limpc> Cork: sc_listener holds $('html') if not ie 7/8.  so sc_listener.bind('resize' .. should work far as i can tell?
[02:04:44] <Cork> limpc: not fully sure, but i would say no
[02:04:53] <Cork> window and html isn't the same element
[02:04:58] <Cork> it is close but not the same
[02:05:17] <Cork> well actually
[02:05:22] <Cork> html and document is close
[02:05:27] <Cork> window is not the same at all
[02:05:37] <limpc> ahh ty. fixed
[02:05:38] <Amnesia> Cork: function prototype
[02:05:39] <Amnesia> :P
[02:05:43] <Cork> document.documentElement === 'html'
[02:06:05] <Cork> Amnesia: no, i don't think that is the term
[02:06:12] <limpc> yikes. need to put that on a timer lol. 50 triggers/sec is a no bueno
[02:06:38] <Amnesia> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prototype
[02:06:41] <Cork> limpc: why do you need a timer?
[02:06:44] <Amnesia> prototype/interface
[02:07:10] <Cork> Amnesia: yes, but that isn't what i talked about
[02:07:14] <limpc> Cork: recalculating elements on dom resize.  i dont need it to do that for every pixel during active resize event
[02:07:28] <Cork> the prototype is only needed if you need to reference a function before it is defined
[02:07:39] <Cork> the definition order is what i was talking about
[02:07:55] <Cork> (wrong term i know)
[02:07:57] <Amnesia> prolongueyeah
[02:08:18] <Amnesia> you aren't referring to a function prolongue :P?
[02:08:28] <gry> when i $('<div>',{id: 'foo'}).prependTo('#baz'), how do i specify innerhtml of the div?
[02:08:35] <fabioportieri> Cork: forward declaration?
[02:08:52] <Cork> fabioportieri: that sounds about right
[02:08:56] <limpc> yeah its declaration.
[02:09:13] <Cork> read it in another language so not 100% sure
[02:09:13] <limpc> good ol' C/C++ days :)
[02:09:47] <Cork> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration
[02:09:54] <xec> gry: $('<div>',{id: 'foo', html: myHtmlHere }).prependTo('#baz')
[02:09:56] <Cork> yes that is what i was thinking of
[02:10:08] <xec> gry: (if i remember correctly)
[02:10:52] <xec> gry: you could also do $('<div id="foo">'+myHtmlHere+'</div>')
[02:11:41] <ravenzz> what about $('<div/>', { id: 'foo' }).html(myHtmlHere).appendTo('#baz') ?
[02:11:49] <xec> that works too :)
[02:11:59] <xec> so many options! *headspin*
[02:12:47] <Cork> $('<div/>').attr('id', 'foo').html(myHtmlHere).appendTo('#baz') :)
[02:12:58] <Cork> $('#baz').append($('<div/>').attr('id', 'foo').html(myHtmlHere))
[02:18:13] <Amnesia> TypeError: $(...).on is not a function
[02:18:16] <Amnesia> syntax error o0?
[02:18:30] <Cork> sounds like you have a pre 1.9 version of jquery
[02:18:51] <Amnesia> https://privatepaste.com/187770e633
[02:18:59] <Amnesia> yep
[02:19:09] <Cork> what version are you using?
[02:19:13] <Amnesia> and unfortunately it's not an option to update
[02:19:18] <Amnesia> (don't blame me:P)
[02:19:23] <Cork> what version are you using?
[02:19:25] <Amnesia> ehm
[02:19:31] <Amnesia> 1.5
[02:19:38] <Amnesia> </stoneage>
[02:19:41] <xec> ouch
[02:20:01] <Cork> Amnesia: so replace on with delegate
[02:20:08] <Cork> and switch the arguments
[02:20:20] <Amnesia> ty!
[02:20:23] <Cork> delegate(selector, event, func)
[02:20:32] <seutje> ew, localized class names and stuff :x
[02:20:34] <Amnesia> muchas gracias
[02:20:37] <limpc> hmm when i resize elements on a window resize (mainly right margins), it seems to work, but doesnt actually refresh the UI unless i hover my mouse over one of the elements.  am i missing something?
[02:20:58] * Cork shivers
[02:21:12] * seutje hands Cork a hot cocoa
[02:21:25] * limpc hands Cork a shot of whiskey
[02:21:31] <seutje> it's dangerous out there, take this!
[02:21:41] <Amnesia> surfdue: dunno whether that was pointed to me, but this entire codebase's nasty as fuck:p
[02:21:54] * Cork puts on sunglasses
[02:22:11] <Amnesia> eh seutje*
[02:22:12] <Cork> Amnesia: ya, inherited code tend to be that
[02:22:17] <seutje> :P
[02:22:54] <Amnesia> ugh, still having theming issues -.-
[02:23:05] <Amnesia> *down the highway*
[02:23:09] <seutje> Amnesia: I constantly give my coworkers shit for it :P
[02:23:17] <Amnesia> heh
[02:24:19] <limpc> is there a way to force the elements to refresh? im not sure why it's only showing the new size after a mouseover event
[02:24:40] <Amnesia> https://privatepaste.com/b74885e589
[02:29:11] <Amnesia> http://i.imgur.com/Mo2NJZt.png
[02:29:31] <Amnesia> any chance it's caused by the ancient jquery version?
[02:32:29] <gry> xec: sorry, but $('<div id="foo">'+myHtmlHere+'</div>') is unreadable
[02:32:50] <gry> xec, thanks for the $('<div>',{id: 'foo', html: myHtmlHere }) idea, I will try it.
[02:33:21] <Cork> it is also a bit risky if you have user inputs in the myHtmlHere variable
[02:33:32] <gry> xec, html: works, thank you.
[02:34:42] <Amnesia> Cork: have I fucked up?
[02:34:58] <Cork> not sure what the problem is
[02:35:14] <Amnesia> check out the screenshot
[02:35:21] <Cork> and?
[02:35:21] <Amnesia> (I know you don't like them^^)
[02:35:40] <Amnesia> afaik the code's the same as your mockup from jsfiddle
[02:40:26] <gry> how do I insert text at cursor in textarea? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/946534/insert-text-into-textarea-with-jquery looks like a bunch of things I would have to self-maintain
[02:41:35] <Cork> gry: http://blog.vishalon.net/index.php/javascript-getting-and-setting-caret-position-in-textarea/
[02:41:50] <hellothere> hey there, for some reason http://jsfiddle.net/drLx9/ this will pop the alert message even if the error aint true, i mean it should like a loop go through the if for example if i put a return; in the if it will just keep returning all the time not going to the else for some reason. Though it seems to work as an error check any ideas?
[02:42:40] <Cork> hellothere: is errorLabel really an input or select element?
[02:43:02] <hellothere> its a class
[02:43:22] <Cork> well sure, but on what element?
[02:43:33] <hellothere> its a css class
[02:43:37] <Cork> ...
[02:43:45] <Cork> well sure, but on what element?
[02:43:56] <Cork> the --> ELEMENT <--
[02:44:44] <hellothere> textbox?
[02:44:51] <Cork> textbox?
[02:44:58] <Cork> there is no textbox element
[02:45:02] <Cork> input of textarea
[02:45:07] <hellothere> its for a textbox under a <p> element
[02:45:28] <hellothere> sorry about that cork <: i am being a bit retarted xD
[02:45:42] <Cork> so is it an input or a textarea?
[02:45:57] <hellothere> textarea
[02:46:00] <Cork> ok
[02:46:02] <hellothere> not an input
[02:46:40] <Cork> and what does console.log(error) give you?
[02:46:44] <hellothere> but i just wanna check if class .errorlabel is called in html then it means its true and if its true i just want to return back to the loop till it disappears and continues to the else
[02:47:03] <Cork> uh what loop?
[02:47:16] <Cork> the reload loop?
[02:47:20] <hellothere> i mean the if yes
[02:47:38] <Cork> well console.log the content in the error
[02:47:41] <Cork> and see what it is
[02:47:42] <hellothere> if errorlabel exists in html then return back to oncick or else move to the else
[02:48:17] <Cork> so you don't want the value at all?
[02:48:22] <Cork> just see if the element exists?
[02:48:27] <hellothere> yes
[02:48:37] <Cork> $('.errorLabel').length > 0 then
[02:48:58] <hellothere> so var error= $('.errorLabel').length > 0
[02:48:59] <limpc> arg... so, $(window).on('resize') works, but $(window).on('resize.mynamespace') doesnt.. why?
[02:49:24] <Cork> limpc: should work just fine
[02:49:37] <limpc> yeah, but im not getting any event hits.. grr
[02:49:44] <hellothere> cork does it goes like that var error = ($('.errorLabel').length > 0); ?
[02:50:00] <limpc> actually nm, something else is wrong
[02:50:01] <hellothere> or should i use if  ($('.errorLabel').length > 0);
[02:50:01] <Cork> hellothere: both works
[02:52:37] <hellothere> doesnt work cork <:
[02:52:50] <limpc> lol was on the wrong url.
[02:53:14] <Cork> hellothere: then you don't have any elements with class="errorLabel" in the page
[02:53:21] <Amnesia> Cork: I've tried your code, but the button theming of the original row after the clone has been removed, is still mangled
[02:53:53] <Cork> Amnesia: then it is something else in your code
[02:55:08] <Amnesia> the cloning part's working fine
[02:55:08] <Amnesia> but rebut removing itbut removing the clone screws stuff up
[02:55:33] <Amnesia> dafuq, "but removing the clone screws stuff up" *
[02:55:50] <Cork> Amnesia: it works in the fiddle
[02:56:03] <Cork> so it is something outside the code you showed doing something
[02:56:24] <Amnesia> could it be css related?
[02:56:28] <hellothere> Cork: can i on location.reload(); add a delay?
[02:56:41] <hellothere> i mean wait 5 seconds before reloading the page or smthing
[02:56:41] <Cork> Amnesia: possible, but not likely
[02:57:03] <Cork> hellothere: how are you sending the data to the server?
[02:57:06] <Cork> ajax or plain http?
[02:57:16] <hellothere> http
[02:57:32] <Cork> then the js will stop as the page starts loading
[02:57:39] <Cork> and the code you have there won't do thing
[02:58:01] <hellothere> hmm
[02:58:03] <Cork> well except possibly break things
[02:58:12] <Cork> as you will interupt the post and do a reload instead
[02:58:21] <Cork> so the post won't ever happen
[03:08:56] <limpc> Cork: any idea why the 'groupContainer' div doesnt show updated dimensions until you "touch" it? http://r.profferlabs.com/scroll/
[03:09:23] <limpc> if you go into inspector and disable/enable ANY css attribute on the element, it adjusts itself to the correct width after a window resize
[03:09:39] <limpc> but not before.  im going crazy
[03:10:17] <gry> are there any missed things in the short version here? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15976574/how-to-add-a-text-to-a-textbox-from-the-current-position-of-the-pointer-with-jqu
[03:14:10] <Cork> limpc: not really time to dig too far into it, but it looks like you expect width to auto calculate in a situation where it doesn't
[03:14:21] <Cork> (#css might be a good place to ask)
[03:14:38] <limpc> allright thanks.
[03:26:36] <fRAiLtY-> Need some advice, go here: http://www.instantprint.co.uk/businesscards/designs and click a design, any design, and go to customise. You end up at sort of a WYSIWYG editor (I think ui) that generates images and PDF's using JSON, can anyone shed anymore light on how this is achieved, additional methods etc? We think it's Java but wondered if it's possible in PHP
[03:31:03] <fabioportieri> it's javascript
[03:31:27] <fabioportieri> the backend can be whatever

[03:38:59] <limpc> hrm how do you translate drag on touch devices?
[03:39:02] <kristofe_> now it's just executing the submit over and over and not submittin
[03:46:17] <limpc> whats the drag equivalent on touch devices?
[03:47:02] <CoderBoi> What is the meaning of life?

[03:49:34] <CoderBoi> Exactly
[03:49:43] <CoderBoi> Maybe they dig the real-time interaction
[03:50:07] <limpc> fabioportieri: well google doesnt return the same results for everyone. i didnt get that url on my search results.
[03:50:21] <fabioportieri> limpc: i just entered your exact words

[04:17:14] <seutje> o.O
[04:17:21] <seutje> there's no " in yo string
[04:17:21] <xec> hrm, does b-ot exec js?
[04:17:22] <gry> `eval "a:b:c:d:e".split(':')
[04:17:27] <xec> errr sry :
[04:17:29] <seutje> js> print('lol');
[04:17:30] <gry> ?eval "a:b:c:d:e".split(':')

[04:17:39] <gry> grumble
[04:17:44] <xec> seutje: cheers
[04:17:53] <gry> I'm just a bit lazy to join() or some like
[04:17:58] <gry> guess I will
[04:18:12] <xec> js> print("a:b:c:d:e".split(":"))
[04:18:14] <b-ot> xec: a,b,c,d,e
[04:18:38] <xec> do you need the print() ?
[04:18:45] <xec> js> "a:b:c:d:e".split(":")
[04:18:52] <b-ot> xec: No output.
[04:18:57] <xec> i guess so
[04:20:55] <seutje> js> var arr = 'a:b:c:d:e'.split(':'); print(arr.shift() + ', ' + arr.shift() + ', ' + arr.join(':'));
[04:20:57] <b-ot> seutje: a, b, c:d:e
[04:21:12] <seutje> gry: like that?
[04:21:25] <seutje> xcept I threw em into a string for clarity
[04:21:46] <CoderBoi> If our loooove insanity why are you my clarity

[04:30:05] <xec> what a boring title
[04:35:45] <mathias1> Hi there, I have question about an strange behaviour with Chromium browsers. I ve build a simple layout and a i want to use the toggle-function. You can find an example on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/j7MZF/
[04:35:45] <mathias1> It works fine on firefox and IE11. but with Chromium one have to click three times to get it work correctly. Did I made a mistake somewhere?
[04:41:42] <seutje> mathias1: the callback for fadeToggle is run once for each result in that selector
[04:49:51] <mathias1> ok seutje , i guess thats why block1 and block2 get hide after the first click and further functions are ignored. but with a second click in chromium, all other events take place. and every thing works fine from the thrid click on.
[04:49:51] <mathias1> or is there a better way to combine the events click and fadeToggle?
[04:50:36] <seutje> mathias1: http://jsfiddle.net/j7MZF/1/
[04:50:54] <seutje> the if is to check if we're done animating them all
[04:51:08] <seutje> I used a boolean instead of an integer, cause and integer made no sense, rly
[04:51:26] <seutje> also used toggleClass instead of the awkward divisible-by-2 thing
[04:51:55] <seutje> lol, u can remove the boolean, it's just sitting there getting garbage collected :P
[04:52:35] <seutje> and I guess u can combine the toggleClass calls into one: http://jsfiddle.net/j7MZF/2/
[05:00:40] <mathias1> seutje: ohh noooo, could it be sooooo easy? i thought about it for hours. thats why i came to the countclick and so on... anyway: thank you very much. you made my day. i didnt know about the :animated selector. definetly one very good feature of jQuery!
[05:13:02] <seutje> mathias1: it's not very performant though, so beware when using it in loops and stuff
[05:18:51] <Junior> I have the following issue (the code is not dry) -> http://pastebin.com/KE8hXg4t function 1 is just a copy of function 2 . If i simulate a "live click" the form fields are not populated
[05:19:12] <Junior> full html at -> http://pastebin.com/rU8E2LM9 . what i pasted (the scripts work, but in jQuery("table").on('click','.mymodal',function(){ } i have most of the code copied from function 2 , which is not ok.. if i uncomment the trigger , the simulate click works, i can see http requests, but i don't have any data filled up in my input_form . somehow data doesn't get updated in the form, although the function 2 updates it. i have tried with .hide() , show , r
[05:19:39] <Junior> Any ideeas on how i can solve this?
[05:35:16] <h89ihu> Hello. If you have $(document).ready( ... and you put an alert in there -- assuming the only content on the html page between <body> and </body> is <strong>Test</strong -- would you expect the alert to appear BEFORE the word Test appears on the screen, or AFTER it appears on the screen?
[05:35:46] <h89ihu> I am using Safari, and I see the alert appear before the word Test appears. When I click OK on the alert box, the page finishes loading and the word Test appears. I just wanted to see if that behaviour is normal
[05:39:06] <h89ihu> It does the same thing if I do $(window).ready... is that normal?
[05:41:41] <seutje> h89ihu: iirc you can fix that by including a CSS file before jQuery
[05:41:52] <seutje> sound stupid, I know, but safari can be a bit thick
[05:42:17] <MyConnectionDrop> my connection just dropped out, so i'll reask the question
[05:42:39] <MyConnectionDrop> if I have $(document).ready() and I have an alert in there... would I expect to see the alert before I see the text on my webpage, or AFTER?
[05:42:45] <seutje> h89ihu: iirc you can fix that by including a CSS file before jQuery
[05:42:49] <seutje> MyConnectionDrop: ^
[05:43:03] <MyConnectionDrop> thanks seutje
[05:43:23] <MyConnectionDrop> So in normal behaviour, the alert should be AFTER the text appears on the webpage?
[05:44:42] <seutje> here we go: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5521
[05:44:52] <seutje> MyConnectionDrop: not necessarily
[05:45:00] <seutje> document ready just means the DOM is ready to be manipulated
[05:47:02] <MyConnectionDrop> window means all the assets have been loaded right?
[05:47:06] <seutje> MyConnectionDrop: might be solved by wrapping it in an empty settimeout
[05:47:16] <MyConnectionDrop> so if I had an image on the page, i'd expect to see the image before the alert?
[05:47:47] <seutje> oh no, not at all
[05:48:06] <seutje> doc rdy doesn't say anything about downloaded assets or rendering
[05:48:23] <MyConnectionDrop> oh ok
[05:48:24] <seutje> just that the DOM is parsed and ready to be manipulated
[05:48:28] <seutje> if u want to wait for images
[05:48:31] <seutje> `g imagesloaded
[05:48:33] <b-ot> seutje: desandro/imagesloaded · GitHub → https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[05:48:35] <MyConnectionDrop> I am just starting out with jquery :)
[05:48:48] <seutje> cause even $('img').bind('load', fn) is kinda unreliable
[05:49:06] <seutje> cause if the image is grabbed from cache, some browsers will be all "it never loaded, I swear!"
[05:49:29] <MyConnectionDrop> So in summary, it is not unusual that with $(document).ready() I'm seeing the alert before the html appears on the screen, and the html only finishes loading once I click OK in the alert box?
[05:49:35] <MyConnectionDrop> that's normal behaviour?
[05:51:03] <seutje> no
[05:51:11] <seutje> again
[05:51:24] <seutje> doc rdy means the document is parsed and ready to be manipulated
[05:51:42] <seutje> ergo, the HTML is done loading
[05:51:49] <MyConnectionDrop> Sorry... no, it's not unusual. Or no it's not normal behaviour?
[05:51:53] <seutje> well, not entirely, but sorta
[05:52:08] <MyConnectionDrop> seutje: but the HTML can be finished loading without being rendered can't it?
[05:52:17] <seutje> it already has
[05:52:30] <seutje> but alert is a blocking operation
[05:52:53] <MyConnectionDrop> I'm totally confused then
[05:53:11] <seutje> so at this point the document is entirely loaded, but not rendered yet
[05:53:12] <MyConnectionDrop> it definitely hasn't rendered, but ready is only called after it's finished loading?
[05:53:16] <MyConnectionDrop> yes
[05:53:18] <MyConnectionDrop> thats right
[05:53:22] <seutje> some browsers will already be pre-fetching assets, but not by definition
[05:53:41] <MyConnectionDrop> I am using Safari, which was mentioned in the bug you linked to
[05:54:00] <MyConnectionDrop> I just want to know if I should be worried?
[05:54:09] <seutje> yeah, safari seems to throw ready way before rendering
[05:54:20] <seutje> it's web dev, you should always be worried
[05:54:29] <MyConnectionDrop> Is the fact that the alert is appearing before the content is rendered something I should be worried about? Or just something I should be aware of?
[05:54:41] <seutje> you could avoid doc.rdy all together and just move your code to the bottom of the document
[05:55:11] <MyConnectionDrop> Move my <script> code to the bottom? But doesn't it need to be a child of <head> ?
[05:55:14] <seutje> MyConnectionDrop: you should be avoiding any blocking operations anyway, so it would only matter if you need to grab dimensions at this point
[05:55:19] <seutje> nosir, not at all
[05:55:45] <seutje> http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/high-performance-sites-rule-6-move-scripts-bottom-7200.html
[05:56:18] <MyConnectionDrop> oh wow
[05:56:53] <MyConnectionDrop> so <body><strong>text here</strong><script type="text/javascript">jquery code in here</script></body> is perfectly legitimate?
[05:57:13] <seutje> yup
[05:57:20] <seutje> u can even drop the type
[05:57:27] <seutje> javascript is assumed when it's ommitted
[05:57:42] <MyConnectionDrop> oh okay, cool
[05:57:44] <seutje> then you can put the most blocking thing in there, the text should still render
[05:57:49] <MyConnectionDrop> I just tried that, it made no difference
[05:57:54] <MyConnectionDrop> :(
[05:57:56] <seutje> (unless it's being rendered in a custom font that is still being downloaded)
[05:58:06] <seutje> forreal? o.O
[05:58:07] <MyConnectionDrop> could it be the fact I have an image?
[05:58:15] <seutje> the text should still appear
[05:58:17] <MyConnectionDrop> maybe it's cached or something and that is messing it up?
[05:59:44] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/Sgc28/embedded/result/
[05:59:50] <seutje> try that real quick if u will
[06:00:13] <MyConnectionDrop> Sure, one second. Here is a paste of what I used: http://pastebin.ca/2538008
[06:00:13] <seutje> yeah, chrome will show it, safari won't
[06:00:29] <seutje> yet another fucked up "usability feature"
[06:00:49] <seutje> ur jquery library is still in the head
[06:01:13] <bberry> if i have e.preventDefault() in one of my event handlers, will unbind work to return the event handler to its original?
[06:01:27] <MyConnectionDrop> Ah, I'll try moving that too... hang on
[06:01:38] <MyConnectionDrop> In response to your jsfiddle, I don't see the text until I click OK
[06:02:01] <seutje> MyConnectionDrop: yeah, like I said, getting the same thing in safari, but not in chrome
[06:02:25] <MyConnectionDrop> Even with the library in the body, it loads the alert before the text
[06:02:46] <seutje> yeah
[06:03:03] <MyConnectionDrop> so it's a safari issue?
[06:03:37] <seutje> MyConnectionDrop: lol: http://jsfiddle.net/Sgc28/1/embedded/result/
[06:03:44] <seutje> added a 0ms settimeout
[06:04:22] <seutje> (which comes down to a minimum of like 4ms)
[06:04:36] <MyConnectionDrop> yeah, that works on safari
[06:04:42] <MyConnectionDrop> i see the text before the alert
[06:05:20] <MyConnectionDrop> as you originally said though, in real life this probably wouldn't be an issue would it?
[06:05:27] <MyConnectionDrop> because you would tend not to use alert()
[06:06:05] <MyConnectionDrop> can you envisage any other scenario that this Safari issue could pose a problem?
[06:08:14] <seutje> MyConnectionDrop: when trying to grab the dimensions of an element
[06:08:43] <seutje> I'm not sure if it is in fact not yet rendered, or safari is just overlaying something to hide it until it deems the page ready
[06:09:52] <MyConnectionDrop> dimensions... like height/width?
[06:09:57] <MyConnectionDrop> ok
[06:10:01] <MyConnectionDrop> I will keep that in mind
[06:10:15] <MyConnectionDrop> Thanks for your help. I will keep in mind the settimeout trick in case I need it ;)
[06:12:47] <seutje> MyConnectionDrop: heh, when I try to grab the dimensions of the paragraph, it does actually render it! http://jsfiddle.net/Sgc28/2/embedded/result/
[06:14:04] <seutje> wtf, now it's always rendering it
[06:14:08] <seutje> fuck you, safari
[06:14:34] <fabioportieri> yeah!
[06:35:01] <dp_> is there a way to fire a function when a $.each finishes running?
[06:35:35] <NoiseEee> just write a function after it, dp_
[06:35:52] <NoiseEee> thats a sync case; doesn't need a callback/etc
[06:38:01] <dp_> I'm trying to paginate a data table, after building it all up with $.each(); but the pagination fires before there's any actual data in the table
[06:40:48] <NoiseEee> well figure that out first ;)  use your debugger to figure out why/when its being called
[06:40:58] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[06:41:23] * Velveeta shoots NoiseEee a thumbs up.
[06:42:09] <Velveeta> if that pagination triggers an event, you can try binding to it and using that to trigger a breakpoint so you can check the call stack and see where the call is coming from
[06:42:41] <dp_> yeah, sadly, this page is returning almost 4MB of JSON data
[06:46:21] <NoiseEee> well it sounds like perhaps the pagination should be involved in a callback to that fetch of data.
[06:46:33] <Velveeta> right
[06:46:34] <NoiseEee> worst sentence ever but you get it
[06:47:59] <dp_> yeah
[06:48:27] <dp_> actually, if I can paginate the data before it ever goes in to the data table, that would be the best. do you have any suggestions on handling that?
[06:49:04] <Velveeta> well typically for something like that, you would request a page # from the server, and # of items, and the server would do the pagination and just send back 1 page
[06:49:39] <MyConnectionDrop> seutje: yeah, I could have sworn yesterday it was rendering the page before displaying the alert!
[06:49:48] <MyConnectionDrop> maybe safari is just temperamental
[06:55:16] <`ULT> hi all!
[06:55:40] * Velveeta smashes his face into a cake and says "HELLOOOOOOOO!"
[06:57:15] <MyConnectionDrop> Is there any difference between $('document') and $(document) ?
[06:57:38] <Cork> yes
[06:57:42] <Cork> the first won't find anything
[06:57:49] <|RicharD|> hi to all
[06:57:51] <Cork> the second wraps document in jquery
[06:58:28] <Cork> MyConnectionDrop: alternatively it can be said as, the first is a selector, the second wraps an object
[06:58:33] <|RicharD|> what plugins is used here: https://onlycoin.com/ for moving images at scrolling the page ?
[06:58:34] <MyConnectionDrop> I accidentally used the first one with a .ready a minute ago, to swap some elements... and it worked!
[06:59:21] <MyConnectionDrop> ie. just stored $('strong').text() in some variable, did the same for $('p').text()... swapped over the contents, and it worked... inside $('document').ready(...
[06:59:25] <MyConnectionDrop> why would that still work?
[06:59:42] <Cork> not sure
[06:59:49] <Cork> might be some magic in jquery for ready
[06:59:58] <Cork> so that $().ready() works
[07:00:04] <MyConnectionDrop> ahh
[07:00:07] <MyConnectionDrop> ok
[07:00:25] <Cork> but $('document') won't ever find anything
[07:00:42] <Cork> as there is no <document> elements
[07:01:03] <MyConnectionDrop> got it. thanks :)
[07:08:34] <nitzer> hey! how do you call an image that appears from the border? like a banner, that on mouseover display the rest of the content?
[07:09:59] <Velveeta> i have no idea what you're trying to ask...
[07:10:30] <nitzer> idk how to call it , but is like an image sliding from the border i've seen it many times
[07:10:57] <Velveeta> just a slide animation?
[07:11:06] <nitzer> it's like a slide animation
[07:11:19] <nitzer> the fact it is an sliding image from the border
[07:11:42] <Velveeta> i don't know what you mean by "from the border"
[07:11:53] <nitzer> em, the window border
[07:12:16] <Velveeta> ok, so a slide animation from off-window to somewhere in the window
[07:12:21] <nitzer> like {position:absolute; right:0px}
[07:12:28] <nitzer> yea! that
[07:12:44] <BillCriswell> 0 === 0px === 0anything
[07:13:16] <BillCriswell> /cranky
[07:13:45] <Velveeta> you can use the jquery ui slide effect: http://api.jqueryui.com/slide-effect/ .. or, depending on what browsers you need to support, you can do it with a css transition
[07:15:18] <nitzer> i'm making one by myself, and have a problem, the image shows after the size of the content is >= to the image width
[07:15:44] <effortDee> im after a spiiner in jquery
[07:15:47] <effortDee> where do i start?
[07:15:55] <nitzer> i think it has something to do with overflow:hidden
[07:15:55] <Velveeta> google?
[07:17:37] <Velveeta> nitzer: you asked how to make it happen, and i gave you 2 potential solutions… if you're writing your own version and need help in debugging it, then you need to post us a jsfiddle example
[07:18:18] <nitzer> ok, on the way
[07:20:41] <sekyms_> everyone have a link to the MSDN page with all the isos for development?
[07:21:20] <Velveeta> everyone or anyone?
[07:21:26] <sekyms_> the later
[07:21:28] <sekyms_> sorrry
[07:22:12] <nitzer> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/u6b88/
[07:22:55] <nitzer> that's what im trying to do, the problem is that the image shows after the width is equal or higher to image's width
[07:26:00] <MyConnectionDrop> seutje, thank you for your help earlier
[07:26:02] <MyConnectionDrop> Bye
[07:26:03] <Velveeta> yeah, that may be nothing more than a browser rendering engine optimization, in that it may not load the image until its space is visible, i'm not sure.. if i change it to set the width to 250, it never loads, if i change it to 500, it loads mid-animation, but in all cases, it seems to require the space be big enough to fully display the image
[07:26:36] <Velveeta> but let me keep playing with it
[07:27:36] <nitzer> maybe im mis-using the overflow
[07:29:07] <Velveeta> nitzer: here you go, you should be animating position, not width: http://jsfiddle.net/u6b88/7/
[07:29:34] <Velveeta> you should also use mouseenter and mouseleave vs mouseover and mouseout, or else you'll get multiple animations queued during mouseover
[07:29:54] <nitzer> Velveeta: thanks :D let me see it
[07:30:34] <nitzer> hey! that works great :)
[07:30:55] <nitzer> that's what i was trying to do! many thanks :}
[07:31:01] <Velveeta> no problemo
[07:31:28] <effortDee> thats cool velveeta
[07:31:55] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[07:42:05] <BillCriswell> I think my stomach is trying to fight my body.
[07:43:13] <Velveeta> punch it! let it know who's the boss!
[07:43:42] <lasha> i feel sickly.
[07:44:19] <thekkid> I'm having an issue where I empty a tbody and then append rows back to it but for some reason all the original rows come back
[07:44:35] <lasha> show code
[07:49:08] <thekkid> lasha: I'll try for a couple more minutes and if I can't get it I'll write an analagous example because I can't show code.
[07:49:38] <lasha> jsfiddle.net is your friend.
[07:50:08] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: It's usually so good to me though.
[07:51:05] <Velveeta> billcriswell: sometimes you just need to smack em back in line
[07:57:15] <bberry> Hey guys, I'm looking to get the response from a form submission.  I saw ajaxComplete, but the jquery site says that that should only be attached to $(document).... Suggestions?
[07:57:46] <Velveeta> you can chain right off of your ajax call with .done()
[07:58:08] <bberry> so can i do like .submit().done()?
[07:58:11] <Velveeta> or you can just pass a "complete" or "success" option to the ajax function when you invoke it, with your success/complete callback
[07:58:40] <Velveeta> nope, in your submit handler that's transmitting your form data via ajax, you'd attach it to the piece of code that's shipping it via ajax
[07:59:43] <bberry> hmm... okay. so like $("#uploadForm").on("submit", callbackFxn).done(function(response){ //do stuff});
[08:00:13] <bberry> s/callbackFxn/submitHandler/
[08:00:58] <Velveeta> not exactly, it would go inside of submitHandler, unless submitHandler returns the ajax xhr
[08:02:12] <bberry> hmm....aight.  I'll have to explain more of whats going on then :/ ill make a jsfiddle, one sec
[08:11:46] <bberry> Velveeta: blegh... its going to be a lot of code to make a working example.  ill just fill in some blanks with comments

[08:29:11] <bberry> Velveeta: screw the example, too much code to try to condense.  Basically, im using a form to upload a file to the server.  There is a
[08:29:23] <bberry> 'hack' to do this using iframes so that the whole page doesnt reload
[08:29:30] <Velveeta> right
[08:29:44] <bberry> so the way that i was determining if the file upload was successful was using the onload event from the iframe
[08:29:48] <maxmoore14> contrived example: http://jsfiddle.net/FaMFj/
[08:30:29] <maxmoore14> given a string like 'b.c.d' can anyone tell me how to get something along those lines working?
[08:30:36] <bberry> but it seems like if i do a e.preventDefault on the form submit, it still reloads the iframe
[08:31:27] <Velveeta> maxmoore14: that violates javascript syntax, so you can't do it that way
[08:31:30] <bberry> (i do e.preventDefault on the form submit because i check to make sure the file that the user is uploading isnt on the server already. if it is, the i prevent the sumission and ask the user if he/she wants to replace it)
[08:31:38] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: right
[08:31:53] <Velveeta> this would be the closest you could hope for: http://jsfiddle.net/FaMFj/1/
[08:31:54] <maxmoore14> I'm asking for a suggestion on how to handle a situation like that
[08:32:01] <Velveeta> oh ok
[08:32:19] <bberry> then if the user clicks yes at that point, i unbind the old submit handler, do a normal submit, and then "rebind" the submit handler to what it was before
[08:32:40] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: yeah, that could work. I could split the string on .
[08:32:48] <maxmoore14> thanks
[08:32:51] <maxmoore14> I'll give it a try
[08:33:35] <bberry> Velveeta: Too confusing? haha
[08:37:00] <Velveeta> maxmoore14: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/FaMFj/7/
[08:38:06] <bberry> Velveeta: I'm writing up a more straightforward explanation... lol i suck at explaining things
[08:38:10] <Velveeta> bberry: as for your problem, i would think that yes, you'd want to listen for the onload event on the iframe, but as for getting the result back to the parent, you'll have to output something from controller function on the server that the iframe can consume when it finishes its page load, and hand up to the window.parent
[08:39:07] <bberry> Yeah.  I dont necessarily need to get the contents of a response. just need to make sure that i am actually doing a submit when i want, because it seems the iframe is reloading when it shouldnt be
[08:40:52] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: yours definitely works, thanks - out of curiosity, why doesn't mine? http://jsfiddle.net/FaMFj/8/
[08:41:07] <Velveeta> then yeah, i would think iframe.onload is the way to go
[08:41:36] <bberry> aight
[08:41:52] <maxmoore14> ah
[08:41:54] <maxmoore14> typo
[08:41:58] <maxmoore14> it does work too
[08:42:02] <bberry> theres still problems with e.preventDefault not working properly, but i dont think i could show you that easily without pasting more code than youd probably want to look at
[08:42:03] <bberry> lol
[08:42:10] <maxmoore14> http://jsfiddle.net/FaMFj/9/
[08:42:29] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: thx again
[08:46:13] <drager> I have an ajax call and with that I want to append the data to an element but I want only to append it "once" if you understand. I have some data that's not getting fetched by that ajax call in the same element as well.
[08:47:56] <Velveeta> maxmoore14: http://jsfiddle.net/FaMFj/11/ … that breaks when trying to dereference an undefined value
[08:48:12] <Velveeta> that's why you should typecheck it in a recursive function like i did, or otherwise check for it in your loop
[08:48:30] <Velveeta> bberry: e.preventDefault on which event?
[08:48:49] <maxmoore14> Velveeta: yes, agreed. yours is more stable
[08:49:14] <maxmoore14> in my use case, I actually want it to break if undefined - cause that should never happen
[08:49:29] <maxmoore14> I don't want to hide a potential bug
[08:49:34] <bberry> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/qd8Rz/1/
[08:49:41] <bberry> I think there is a scoping problem.
[08:49:43] <bberry> er
[08:49:44] <bberry> timing rather
[08:50:19] <bberry> because it execute the uploadSubmitCallback, does the ajax call, and then exits that function.  Then when the ajax call comes back it does the e.preventDefault()
[08:50:22] <bberry> but by that time it is too late
[08:50:49] <bberry> maybe if i make the ajax synchronous?
[08:52:02] <bberry> (also, dont bother reading the HTML, its just for showing you what the popup windows look like)
[08:55:08] <bberry> i just set async:false and it appears to be working properly
[09:03:30] <Velveeta> bberry: it's not executing the preventDefault until the ajax comes back because that's how you're telling it to behave by putting it inside your .then() function
[09:03:58] <Velveeta> you should have that in the main body of your uploadSubmitCallback function, and then you don't need async false, which is bad practice anyway
[09:04:27] <kpl> http://jsfiddle.net/5ZKam/   There is a difference in the number of on clicks trigged (as observed by the number of letter "o"s appended to the log div) depending on whether we click outside the "0" or on the "0". Why? (The zero to click, the log letter "o", and the parameter "o" look similar by coincidence).
[09:05:02] <duch_kazatel> kpl did you ever read about event delegation?
[09:05:21] <bberry> Velveeta: Yeah.... Problem is, i do want the submit to not be prevented if it doesnt go into that if statement
[09:05:38] <bberry> Velveeta: Like if there is no matching file, i dont want to e.preventDefault
[09:05:58] <kpl> Yes, but did not find the explanantion. Now I have a fiddle to show the case.
[09:06:04] <Velveeta> bberry: you can add some data to your event object to tell it to force a submit if you want, i can show you an example
[09:06:16] <bberry> please!
[09:06:41] <bberry> Velveeta: Thanks for taking the time to help me btw.  I'm a bit new to this form stuff
[09:07:45] <duch_kazatel> kpl when you're detecting events as they bubble, you'll trigger those bindings when child elements are fired.
[09:08:20] <Velveeta> bberry: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/qd8Rz/2/
[09:08:27] <kpl> duch_kazatel: In the fiddle you can see that I have simplified the selector so there is no longer table there.
[09:08:29] <Velveeta> no problem, that's what we're here for
[09:09:33] <icemancast> jquery mobile questions here or diff channel
[09:09:36] <kpl> duch_kazatel: Sorry, I did not understand what you meant by your last comment.
[09:09:44] <bberry> Velveeta: ah okay, i see what you did there haha. very nice.
[09:10:01] <bberry> Velveeta: Ill try it out. Unfortunately i gotta head out, ill get back to ya tomorrow :D
[09:10:06] <Velveeta> good luck :)
[09:10:16] <duch_kazatel> kpl - when you're detecting a click event using the delegation system, you'll trigger on events on that element, as well as all child elements.
[09:10:40] <duch_kazatel> the event bubbles up the tree, firing that event not just on the specific element, but on all ancestors as well.
[09:11:34] <icemancast> any reason why this wouldn't work on iPad? safari or chrome
[09:11:36] <icemancast> https://gist.github.com/icemancast/8421855
[09:11:56] <kpl> So the click is detected by both #fieldid333 and the elements within it?
[09:12:37] <duch_kazatel> kpl the click is detected on one element, but when that event happens on child elements, it bubbles up through the DOM to wherever your binding is.
[09:17:44] <jayar> having trouble using "required" on radio buttons with validate.js
[09:17:59] <kpl> duch_kazatel: Still not crystal clear to me.. When we click #fieldid333, the click on that div bubbles up to #tablecontent and matches the selector. But when we click the label or input which is a child of #fieldid333, why does the click on that child match?
[09:18:28] <duch_kazatel> kpl give me a minute to look at your code again, but i have a feeling it's very simple.
[09:18:59] <kpl> duch_kazatel: thanks for helping
[09:20:00] <Velveeta> it's because as your click bubbles up, the delegated events are checked at each level… if you have a div with content inside of it, a click on a child of that div is also a click on that div.. if you have a delegated listener at say, the document level, that's listening for clicks on that div, it will trigger for anything within that div that you click on, i'm pretty sure
[09:20:11] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta has it.
[09:20:20] <Velveeta> so your click on a label or input inside of #fieldid333 is causing a click event for #fieldid333 to be interpreted
[09:20:33] <duch_kazatel> it's not just direct descendents, but all descendents
[09:21:11] <Velveeta> if you want to limit your clicks specifically to the label or input, you need to put that check in your callback… look at e.target to see what was initially clicked on, e.currentTarget will hold the current element that the callback was triggered for
[09:21:24] <Velveeta> so in that example, #fieldid333 would be e.currentTarget, but e.target would be the label or input
[09:21:36] <duch_kazatel> $(this) will also be the element that was actually clicked.
[09:22:28] <Es0teric> ok so say i am doing a click event on a ul… how do i extract the li that was clicked at the moment?
[09:22:37] <Velveeta> well $(this) will be the currentTarget i believe
[09:22:48] <duch_kazatel> $(this) within the handler.
[09:22:52] <Velveeta> because if you set your listener to respond to #fieldid333, that's what's actually triggering the callback
[09:23:12] <Velveeta> so if you click on a child, the callback would be executed in the context of the element it was listening for
[09:23:33] <Velveeta> but one quick way to find out :)
[09:25:02] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Z5U45/
[09:25:14] <Velveeta> damnit, you beat me to the fiddle :D
[09:25:23] <duch_kazatel> I use the technique all the time at work.
[09:25:30] <duch_kazatel> it's become second nature to me.
[09:25:41] <Velveeta> but you're listening for '.child'
[09:26:12] <duch_kazatel> sure - that's the delegation syntax.  if you omit that second selector, you don't use that feature, so $(this) would be the ul.
[09:26:27] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/Z5U45/1/
[09:26:46] <duch_kazatel> yup
[09:26:49] <Velveeta> but what we were talking about was that if he had some delegated listener for a certain element, and someone clicked a child of that element somewhere
[09:27:05] <Velveeta> the callback would be executed in the context of the element being listened for, not the actual element that was clicked on
[09:27:15] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah.
[09:27:17] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[09:27:21] <Velveeta> so in the 2nd case, i'm clicking on .child, but the callback is called w/ the scope of #parent
[09:27:30] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[09:27:50] <Velveeta> so it's actually invoked w/ the context of e.currentTarget, but in the case of the 1st example, but e.target and e.currentTarget are the same thing
[09:27:55] <duch_kazatel> oddly enough, that's actually still a result of event bubbling - that's partially how browsers know the UL was clicked.
[09:27:59] <Velveeta> in the 2nd case, e.target is .child and e.currentTarget is #parent
[09:28:10] <Velveeta> right, that's exactly due to event bubbling
[09:28:20] <duch_kazatel> :science:
[09:28:31] <duch_kazatel> kpl are you getting it now?
[09:28:55] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/xbwSShI.jpg
[09:29:03] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[09:29:30] <BillCriswell> He reminds me so much of David Byrne.
[09:29:58] <Velveeta> oh shit, i thinkt he science-off is today!
[09:30:12] <Velveeta> bill nye is taking on the guy from the creationist museum in a debate on a variety of topics
[09:30:35] <duch_kazatel> hah, i know a dude who did a few albums that were produced by byrne
[09:32:53] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Lucky man. Dude is a legend.
[09:33:03] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: That should be hilarious.
[09:33:17] <Velveeta> one would think, but i doubt it'll change any minds either way
[09:33:38] <BillCriswell> Yeah, sadly expected.
[09:34:51] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell ever heard of Geggy Tah?
[09:35:31] <Es0teric> ok so say i am doing a click event on a ul… how do i extract the li that was clicked at the moment?
[09:35:52] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric share your code.
[09:35:56] <BillCriswell> I have not. After reading the wikipedia article I am familiar with The Bird And The Bee.
[09:36:07] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel one sec
[09:36:07] <Velveeta> es0teric: e.target
[09:36:28] <duch_kazatel> you remember this song though: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfRNZucoCyw
[09:36:34] <duch_kazatel> i'd be really surprised if you didn't.
[09:36:37] <Velveeta> provided that's the bottom-level of the markup, if you have a span or something like that inside of it, you might have to do something like $(e.target).closest('li')
[09:36:53] <duch_kazatel> anyway - the "tah" in geggy was was Tommy Jordan.  His sister was my 6th grade teacher.
[09:37:07] <Velveeta> holy shit, i remember that song
[09:37:11] <duch_kazatel> he'd stop in a be crazy sometimes.
[09:37:30] <duch_kazatel> the singer was an interesting dude.
[09:37:54] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I am not familiar with this haha.
[09:38:04] <BillCriswell> What year was this?
[09:38:19] <Velveeta> some year when the world was still grainy
[09:38:41] <Es0teric> Velveeta i am trying to do $(this).target.addClass('active') but it shows up as undefined
[09:38:50] <BillCriswell> Looks like 94. That was a good year for music.
[09:38:57] <Es0teric> but it shows me the context when i do $(this).target
[09:38:59] <Velveeta> es0teric: i showed you an example of how to reference e.target
[09:39:12] <BillCriswell> Punk In Drublic, Dookie, Smash
[09:39:26] <Es0teric> Velveeta yes, but $(this) would be the event
[09:39:27] <Velveeta> green day is still one of my favorites
[09:39:34] <BillCriswell> Ill Communication
[09:39:42] <Velveeta> es0teric: ok, then substitute this where i had e
[09:39:53] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I lost interest after Dookie I think.
[09:39:53] <Es0teric> Velveeta again, i already did that
[09:39:58] <duch_kazatel> oh man now i'm all bummed about MCA
[09:40:28] <Velveeta> es0teric: reread what i said when i talked about if the li was the bottom level of the markup
[09:40:32] <Velveeta> you're syntax is wrong
[09:40:43] <Velveeta> i still remember that day, may 4th
[09:40:47] <Velveeta> fuckin star wars day
[09:41:02] <Velveeta> his death hit me a lot harder than i ever would have expected it to
[09:41:03] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: that was a bummer.
[09:41:29] <duch_kazatel> i think everybody had that reaction.f
[09:42:52] <BillCriswell> Sabotage may be my favorite music video.
[09:43:59] <Es0teric> Velveeta ah i see… so should i do $('.nav').click(function(e) { console.log(e.target); }); ?
[09:44:07] <Velveeta> mine might be for 'make some noise' :D
[09:44:14] <Velveeta> es0teric: yepyep
[09:44:32] <Es0teric> ah ha! yeah i havent worked on js in awhile… i am trying to get back in this lol.. awesome, thanks Velveeta
[09:44:40] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[09:44:59] <Es0teric> yeah i've been doing more PHP/Ruby work lately =_=
[09:56:23] <bsegovia> hey all. Does anyone know an effective method for running a script that checks the initial state of a select drop down? I've got the script working using the change() method, but it only works when the user... changes the input. I need it to run based on the initial value.
[09:57:18] <NoiseEee> bsegovia: run it right away on page load / dom ready?
[09:59:47] <bsegovia> that's the thing. I've tried wrapping it in a document.ready with no luck
[10:00:00] <bsegovia> maybe it's just not setup properly.
[10:00:45] <bsegovia> NoiseEee: here's the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/XL6yL/
[10:00:56] <bsegovia> so it works as expected here
[10:01:28] <bsegovia> but when I drop it into it's own script and add it to the page via the <script> tag it only runs after the user changes the input
[10:06:20] <duch_kazatel> bsegovia what's with the .change(); at the end?
[10:06:46] <duch_kazatel> ah nvm i just scrolled up.
[10:06:58] <bsegovia> duch_kazatel: I was hoping that would like... dunno, rerun it. (it was a desperate man's move)
[10:10:02] <NoiseEee> bsegovia: 'when i drop it into its own script'  is that <script> in the <head> or before </body> ?
[10:10:18] <bsegovia> before </body>
[10:11:25] <bsegovia> i think it has to do with the "change()" method. Sure the script runs at load but it's waiting for a change to occur
[10:11:56] <duch_kazatel> try this - http://jsfiddle.net/XL6yL/1/
[10:12:02] <dekiss> there was one kibrary for detecting browser, anyone knows it? I lost it on github :S
[10:12:20] <duch_kazatel> dekiss detecting browser is old hat - detect for features instead.
[10:13:31] <bsegovia> duch_kazatel: Clever. hardcode an initial function for the first item. Thanks!
[10:13:34] <bsegovia> That would do it
[10:14:03] <bsegovia> duch_kazatel: i see you dropped the change() at the end. guess that wasn't needed?
[10:14:22] <duch_kazatel> bsegovia just make sure you comment what that's doing.  and no, with this technique, you don't need the .change();
[10:14:29] <duch_kazatel> it renders that unnecessary.
[10:14:34] <bsegovia> ok
[10:14:41] <bsegovia> duch_kazatel: Thanks again!
[10:14:46] <dekiss> duch_kazatel I know but
[10:14:48] <duch_kazatel> but my method may not be the best - if you can do it in your backend, I would.
[10:14:51] <dekiss> I need basic identification
[10:15:27] <duch_kazatel> dekiss care to elaborate why?
[10:16:21] <dekiss> hm
[10:16:25] <dekiss> well
[10:16:35] <dekiss> lets say I don't care if user lies about his browser
[10:16:40] <dekiss> making tool like analytics
[10:16:51] <dekiss> duch_kazatel what yo usuggest man
[10:17:06] <dekiss> there was nice library and I lost it
[10:17:10] <dekiss> it was on github:(((
[10:17:29] <duch_kazatel> dekiss are you building an analytics suite?
[10:18:04] <dekiss> ye
[10:18:07] <dekiss> simple tool
[10:18:12] <dekiss> not whole suite
[10:18:17] <dekiss> checking basic stuff
[10:18:42] <duch_kazatel> http://whichbrowser.net/
[10:18:47] <duch_kazatel> there's one  for you i guess.
[10:19:03] <dekiss> yes
[10:19:05] <dekiss> this was it !!!!!!!!!!
[10:19:10] <dekiss> thank you duch_kazatel !
[10:19:18] <duch_kazatel> google is your friend man.
[10:19:23] <dekiss> man I searched
[10:19:27] <dekiss> it output some other tools
[10:19:35] <dekiss> google wouldn't know which is best
[10:19:35] <duch_kazatel> https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+browser+detection&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-beta&channel=sb
[10:19:42] <dekiss> it output what people think its best
[10:19:42] <dekiss> :S
[10:19:43] <duch_kazatel> first link tells you to use which browser.
[10:19:47] <dekiss> thats google fail in long term
[10:20:03] <dekiss> I wrote detect browser github
[10:20:23] <duch_kazatel> the first link is this one - http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html.  this link tells you "I advise you to use WhichBrowser. It’s up-to-date, and contains a treasure trove of mobile information."
[10:20:30] <duch_kazatel> you should've specified language.
[10:20:39] <duch_kazatel> browser detection can be done server-side.
[10:20:40] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:20:52] <dekiss> duch_kazatel why browsers lie?
[10:20:59] <duch_kazatel> dekiss huh?
[10:21:01] <duch_kazatel> which browsers?
[10:21:35] <dekiss> all
[10:21:49] <dekiss> chrome outputs all engines in its agent header
[10:21:57] <dekiss> says its mozila opera ie and what not
[10:22:09] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:22:14] <duch_kazatel> proof for that?
[10:22:24] <dekiss> ah
[10:22:25] <dekiss> ..
[10:22:31] <dekiss> navigator.bowser and you wil lsee
[10:22:38] <dekiss> sorry
[10:22:48] <dekiss> navigator.useragent
[10:22:54] <dekiss> capital a
[10:23:07] <duch_kazatel> "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/31.0.1650.63 Safari/537.36"  looks right to me.
[10:23:35] <bsegovia> duch_kazatel: God bless you sir. That worked like a charm in my backend
[10:24:03] <duch_kazatel> dekiss I think you need to go read about the history of user agents.
[10:24:18] <Velveeta> "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/31.0.1650.63 Safari/537.36"
[10:24:23] <Velveeta> same here
[10:24:23] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[10:24:34] <duch_kazatel> I think he's seeing "Mozilla" and getting confused.
[10:24:42] <Velveeta> or safari
[10:24:49] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[10:25:12] <duch_kazatel> http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/ - here is a decent (if funny) history
[10:25:24] <Velveeta> if you're writing an analytics module, and you want to log the user's browser, why not just log the full user agent string?
[10:25:39] <duch_kazatel> because, you see, the browser is lying.
[10:25:41] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:25:42] <Velveeta> i guess then you couldn't easily cluster "IE" "firefox" etc
[10:26:00] <duch_kazatel> that's why you should get a list of all user agent strings and build your own database for them.
[10:26:05] <Velveeta> right
[10:26:18] <Velveeta> i want to say they have lists like that publicly available
[10:26:39] <duch_kazatel> http://www.useragentstring.com/
[10:26:39] <CoderBoi> Yeah
[10:26:46] <duch_kazatel> among others.
[10:26:55] <jayar> IE doesnt say its IE anymore. it just says its "unkown, like gecko"
[10:27:30] <duch_kazatel> orr, no it doesn't -
[10:27:30] <duch_kazatel>     Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko
[10:27:30] <Velveeta> i thought they were even gonna start publishing mozilla user agent
[10:27:32] <zumba_addict> hey guys, what does this do? $('.someclass').placeholder()
[10:27:36] <Velveeta> yeah there we go
[10:27:52] <Velveeta> zumba_addict: it changes your zumba music to salsa.. run!
[10:27:52] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict that runs the placeholder() method on that selector.
[10:28:08] <jayar> mozilla? like gecko?
[10:28:17] <duch_kazatel> Chrome does the exact same thing.
[10:28:19] <jayar> where does it say IE in there..
[10:28:21] <duch_kazatel> IE still says it's trident.
[10:28:25] <zumba_addict> i'm sorry, what does placeholder func do? I searched google but what i found is html5
[10:28:25] <Velveeta> yeah, probably a widget to polyfill placeholder functionality in older browsers @zumba_addict
[10:28:39] <jayar> yea it saying trident is new to me
[10:28:41] <duch_kazatel> jaua http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2013/09/21/internet-explorer-11-user-agent-string-ua-string-sniffing-compatibility-with-gecko-webkit.aspx
[10:28:41] <Velveeta> it's probably a plugin or widget, it's not a native function
[10:28:44] <duch_kazatel> *jayar
[10:29:05] * Velveeta wipes a single tear from his eye.
[10:29:09] <duch_kazatel> jayar IE11 is a much, MUCH better browser than its predecessors.
[10:29:14] <Velveeta> it's almost like IE is gonna come play nicely with all the other browsers
[10:29:18] <jayar> no i agree
[10:29:19] <duch_kazatel> they all ready are.
[10:29:24] <dekiss> duch_kazatel yes saw?
[10:29:31] <duch_kazatel> dekiss huh?
[10:29:32] <zumba_addict> ok
[10:29:57] <Velveeta> i still haven't gotten to play with IE11 yet, but its debugging utils look pretty splendiforous
[10:30:00] <dekiss> Velveeta how you mean log whole user agent
[10:30:06] <zumba_addict> so most likely we have a library that has placeholder function?
[10:30:10] <dekiss> i need to output sometinh glike ie 10 or firefox 4
[10:30:16] <Velveeta> dekiss: i mean rather than trying to figure out what browser it is, just record the full user agent string
[10:30:30] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta I use it - the dev tools actually have some features I wish others had.
[10:30:32] <duch_kazatel> it's kind of sad.
[10:30:36] <Velveeta> see, but the thing is that you *don't* have to output something like that, you can use public data to figure that stuff out on the server side
[10:30:48] <dekiss> why chroome outputs mozila too in its user agent?
[10:31:03] <duch_kazatel> dekiss read the link I sent earlier - it explains the history
[10:31:06] <Velveeta> maybe it's to convince people to stop sniffing the damn user agent string
[10:32:01] <dekiss> Velveeta I am confused
[10:32:13] <fabioportieri> byebye
[10:32:25] <dekiss> how you mean ;use public data to figure that stuff ont the server  side'?
[10:32:35] <duch_kazatel> basically, chrome uses webkit, which is what safari uses.  webkit wants to be like KHTML, which in turn wanted to be like Gecko, which means everybody wants to be like mozilla.
[10:32:38] <duch_kazatel> which is funny.
[10:33:08] <Velveeta> dekiss: all of that user agent -> readable name info is available publicly
[10:33:17] <CoderBoi> Why is it funny that they all want to be like mozilla?
[10:33:19] <Velveeta> you can just import it into a db table and run queries against it to group your output
[10:33:23] <CoderBoi> It gained some serious popularity bro
[10:33:31] <dekiss> Velveeta how to do that?
[10:33:40] <CoderBoi> Go what people are using and make it better, or die
[10:33:42] <dekiss> hmm
[10:33:43] <dekiss> ye
[10:33:44] <dekiss> :)
[10:33:45] <Velveeta> that's outside the scope of this channel, you'll have to do some research
[10:33:49] <dekiss> Velveeta tahnks !
[10:33:53] <duch_kazatel> CoderBoi it's funny because people hate on mozilla so much.
[10:34:00] <dekiss> Velveeta user agent string don't change over time
[10:34:08] <Velveeta> it sure does
[10:34:14] <dekiss> oh
[10:34:20] <dekiss> there are so many versions
[10:34:23] <Velveeta> but that's why those sites keep their data up to date
[10:34:26] <CoderBoi> now chrome seems to be the talk of the town
[10:34:30] <dekiss> aah i see
[10:34:36] <dekiss> you know some site that offers this?
[10:34:40] <Velveeta> the only thing i ever hate on mozilla for is its resource-hogging
[10:34:55] <Shayanjm> ^^^ +1
[10:34:57] <duch_kazatel> FF is slowly getting better.
[10:34:57] <dekiss> Velveeta whichbrowser library can give me ie 8 or chrome 6?
[10:34:59] <CoderBoi> Atleast for mac inspired users who almost know jack shit about IT but hey, things look pretty
[10:34:59] <Velveeta> dekiss: yep, http://www.lmgtfy.com
[10:35:34] <dekiss> guys lets face it google is one level above everything
[10:35:39] <CoderBoi> haha
[10:35:41] <duch_kazatel> that...
[10:35:43] <duch_kazatel> err...
[10:35:50] <CoderBoi> What money and hiring talent does for you
[10:35:50] <dekiss> its kinda good competition from which humans benefit
[10:35:53] <dekiss> ^^
[10:36:02] <dekiss> we get better and better stuff
[10:36:31] <Shayanjm> I mean if you really want to get down to it... chrome & mozilla aren't 'really' competing for the same reasons
[10:36:38] <Shayanjm> err, chrome & FF**
[10:37:03] <duch_kazatel> they are and aren't.  google DOES give money to mozilla every year.
[10:37:09] <Shayanjm> ^
[10:37:25] <Shayanjm> at the end of the day, they're both browsers so they're competing for that marketshare and marginal increase in performance
[10:37:26] <duch_kazatel> and mozilla has some pretty awesome projects that everybody is benefitting everybody.  asm.js, rust, etc.
[10:37:26] <CoderBoi> Keep your enemies closest
[10:37:28] <CoderBoi> rofl
[10:37:37] <duch_kazatel> CoderBoi i'd disagree with that.
[10:37:49] <Shayanjm> CoderBoi: not enemies. They're competing for two entirely different markets
[10:37:55] <Shayanjm> err, not even competing***
[10:38:00] <CoderBoi> Ooh
[10:38:06] <CoderBoi> No, you meant that
[10:38:23] <duch_kazatel> it's like android vs. iphone - they both "won".  they target different segments.
[10:38:45] <Shayanjm> ^^
[10:39:58] <hlve> can't get on soundcloud. /me cries
[10:44:14] <duch_kazatel> if my employer wasn't awesome, I definitely wouldn't tolerate the bullshit of ColdFusion.
[10:45:34] <derryl> humblebrag
[10:46:22] <duch_kazatel> nah, more of digging through legacy shit that's a combo of CFML and SQL and it's making me cry.
[10:47:26] <dekiss> so
[10:47:36] <dekiss> whats going onwith fb investing in that thing
[10:47:42] <dekiss> but soundcloud owns
[10:47:44] <dekiss> ^^
[10:47:50] <dekiss> someone invested in soundl\cloud?
[10:48:25] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:57:33] <dekiss> duch_kazatel Velveeta Google Analytics like tool is extremely easy to be build
[11:05:29] <duch_kazatel> dekiss woah what?!
[11:05:52] <duch_kazatel> "yeah analytics are really easy that's why omniture and google and others generate so much revenue
[11:05:54] <duch_kazatel> "
[11:07:25] <kpl> duch_kazatel: Would you believe me if I said my double event problem is probably not related to delegated events?
[11:11:48] <kpl> duch_kazatel: Check out this  http://jsfiddle.net/mqHBN/   where it is reproduced with a simple .click binding. The the double is caused by clicking on a label for the radiobutton (and not by a label for a simple div). So probably because clicking the label indirectly causes an additional click on the radiobutton.
[11:13:46] <kpl> In this fiddle you can see that clicking the lower zero, which is a label for a div, gives one event, while clicking the upper zero, which is a label for the radio input, gives two events.
[11:14:19] <kpl> So seems to have noting to do woth delegated events at all..
[11:20:34] <duch_kazatel> kpl you do realize this isn't valid, right? <div id="kk">o</div><label for="kk">0</label>
[11:22:10] <duch_kazatel> kpl let's back way for up - what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:23:48] <kpl> duch_kazatel: sorry, lost my connection, so I didn't see any reply to my last comments referring to  http://jsfiddle.net/mqHBN/
[11:24:01] <duch_kazatel> kpl let's back way for up - what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:24:12] <duch_kazatel> also you do realize that you've got invalid markup in there, right?
[11:25:01] <kpl> No, please point out the invalid markup
[11:25:08] <duch_kazatel> <div id="kk">o</div><label for="kk">0</label>
[11:25:14] <duch_kazatel> also, http://jsfiddle.net/mqHBN/2/
[11:28:00] <kpl> You mean the label cannot be used for a div?
[11:28:21] <duch_kazatel> kpl labels are for form elements.  and either way, look at the example i sent out.  what does that tell you?
[11:31:07] <kpl> Both labels the double event.
[11:31:38] <kpl> So it's not necessary a label for a radio, also for a text input will do.
[11:32:00] <duch_kazatel> kpl http://jsfiddle.net/mqHBN/3/
[11:32:16] <duch_kazatel> adding return false; to the end of that function fixes your problem too.
[11:32:17] <kpl> However, the text input itself produces just one event.
[11:32:32] <duch_kazatel> correct. this is not a "bug" - that is how labels work.
[11:32:59] <kpl> So the double is not caused by clicking a child sending delegated events, as we thought.
[11:34:14] <kpl> Why do the labels create the additional events. Because they activate another element?
[11:36:20] <duch_kazatel> because that's what the spec calls for.
[11:37:00] <duch_kazatel> kpl it still looks like delegation to me, but i'm not 100% familiar with that part of the spec.  either way.
[11:37:28] <kpl> In  http://jsfiddle.net/mqHBN/4/  I added a div with an M, which is a child of #fieldid333, and clicking it creates one event only - with the return false
[11:37:46] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[11:38:01] <duch_kazatel> kpl fyi - .click() is sugar for .on('click', function(){});
[11:39:49] <kpl> I see. But any child of #fieldid333 does not cause the double event, it needs to be a label, right? What is it that spec calls for for labels which gives this double effect?
[11:41:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:41:49] <duch_kazatel> oh, the label will trigger the event on the label AND the form element it's "for"
[11:42:11] <kpl> OK, so that'sit.
[11:42:39] <kpl> So we've got in effect two clicks?
[11:43:59] <kpl> Anyway, your suggested return false, prevents the problem.
[11:44:13] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[11:44:28] <duch_kazatel> you have one click, but it fires events on two elements.
[11:44:33] <duch_kazatel> because forms are funky like that.
[11:46:31] <kpl> It is interesting (at least to me, who got the impression from our earlier discussion that clicking a child would fire events from both child and parent) to note, though, that clicking the M div in http://jsfiddle.net/mqHBN/4/ does not trigger two events.
[11:46:51] <duch_kazatel> because you changed the way you're binding the event.
[11:47:25] <duch_kazatel> and you're actually clicking the .activityfield element.
[11:47:33] <duch_kazatel> m happens to be inside of that.
[11:48:34] <duch_kazatel> kpl you really need to learn about how event binding works.
[11:48:50] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
[11:48:57] <duch_kazatel> that's a great place to start.  and with that, lunch
[11:49:43] <kpl> Thanks for comments and for the link.
[11:51:54] <jaagr> hi. probably wrong place to ask but has anyone ever cared about creating a facade for jquery?
[11:55:38] <BillCriswell> jaagr: Not sure I understand the question?
[12:04:53] <Azure> I have no idea if that even went through.
[12:05:08] <Azure> [Jan14/14 04:02:29PM]  Azure:	 I have a bunch of divs that has a linked image (that takes up the entirety of the div) and a nested div that is overlaid on top of part of the image/link when I hover over the div.
[12:05:08] <Azure> [Jan14/14 04:02:57PM]  Azure:	 When the linked image is clicked, a lightbox pops up.
[12:05:08] <Azure> [Jan14/14 04:03:57PM]  Azure:	 When I am on a phone/tablet, I know that I can intercept ontouchstart and call preventDefault to stop the lightbox from popping up the first time.
[12:05:53] <Azure> What I want to do is when I tap away from the div, the overlaid items should disappear.
[12:07:01] <triven> plz help on this topic
[12:07:01] <triven> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/create-the-slider-with-handle-replaced-by-image
[12:10:39] <Azure> http://pastie.org/8633509 And sample JS and html.
[12:15:50] <cortexman> in this jqueryui code autocompleteselect has access to ui, but autocompletesearch does not have access to ui.  http://ibin.co/18q37TBOvl6G
[12:16:33] <cortexman> does anyone know what's going on?
[12:43:27] <cortexman> why does autocompletesearch in this code not get access to 'ui' ? https://gist.github.com/brianmingus/728ecc867cf0b08b08ba
[12:45:20] <Velveeta> is that from jquery ui's autocomplete?
[12:45:43] <tp43_> I have a script that executes a $("#content").on("change",".nField",function(){ … and then I have some links that load via ajax this very same script, so what end up happenning is the callbacks get executed the number of time I click an ajax link, how can make it so it only registers the call back once
[12:46:18] <cortexman> Velveeta: it's modified but yes. i added autocompletesearch
[12:46:33] <cortexman> i need autocompletesearch to give me the ui element that called it, and it doesn't
[12:46:40] <Velveeta> cortexman: jquery ui's autocomplete doesn't push 2 parameters when it triggers search: if ( this._trigger( "search", event ) === false ) {
[12:47:30] <morelli> hi, how to ask google about cuting off ajax part of jquery? I want to have only ajax.
[12:47:35] <Velveeta> you should just be able to reference 'this.input', since that's what you're setting its listener for
[12:47:50] <Velveeta> the _on will maintain the widget instance as the scope, so this.input should be a valid reference
[12:48:15] <dypsilon> Hi everyone, is it appropriate to store references to large objects with $('element').data() ?
[12:48:27] <duch_kazatel> dypsilon huh?
[12:48:45] <Velveeta> dypsilon: sure, for object storage, you're just storage a reference, it's just a pointer to a location in memory, no matter what size it is
[12:48:46] <shoky> cortexman:  http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-search   Note: The ui object is empty but included for consistency with other events.
[12:49:06] <dypsilon> Velveeta, so it's not a copy, just a ref?
[12:49:09] <Velveeta> shoky: thanks, that sounds like a better answer
[12:49:12] <Velveeta> dypsilon: rightio
[12:49:19] <dypsilon> Velveeta, thank you
[12:49:24] <Velveeta> you're welcome
[12:49:51] <Velveeta> tp43_: i'm not sure exactly what you're saying...
[12:50:00] <tp43_> Velveeta:  I have a script that load this one or more times $("#content").on("change",".nField",function(){ but I only want this callback to be executed once
[12:50:15] <Velveeta> but if you want to make sure something happens just once, you can just store a boolean somewhere and check it prior to loading that item
[12:50:28] <Velveeta> if (!loaded) { loadYourContent(); loaded = true; }
[12:50:30] <duch_kazatel> or use .once(), instead of .on.
[12:50:57] <tp43_> duch_kazatel:  once or one, once says undefined
[12:50:59] <Velveeta> yeah i'm not sure if he's wanting to kill the clickability of those links, or if he just wants to load the script that they load once
[12:51:08] <Velveeta> i couldn't understand the question
[12:51:11] <cortexman> Velveeta: this.input doesn't seem to tell me whether it was 'language_combobox' or 'word_combobox' like `ui' does
[12:51:12] <duch_kazatel> one, rather.
[12:51:19] <tp43_> Velveeta:  yeah true, its just all pages load the same script, so…let me see then
[12:51:28] <duch_kazatel> tp43_ do you one want to bind one event, or do you only want it to fire once, ever?
[12:51:53] <tp43_> duch_kazatel:  yeah, that works if you want the callback to be fired once, but I want to register the call back only once, but it can run more than once
[12:51:57] <cortexman> Velveeta: do you know the this.input equivalent of ui.item.option.parentNode.id
[12:52:10] <tp43_> duch_kazatel:  exactly, I want to bind it just once, not fire it only once
[12:52:49] <morelli> how can I cut off only ajax part and use/load only ajax part?
[12:52:50] <duch_kazatel> tp43_ errr, then you'll have to manually check if its bound and not bind it again.
[12:52:52] <Velveeta> cortexman: that sounds like the option list reference, not the text element that you searched with
[12:53:23] <Velveeta> morelli: if you're using a version older than 1.11 or 2.1, then you'll have to chop it off manually… if you're using 1.11 or 2.1, it comes split out, so you can load just the ajax part
[12:55:30] <morelli> Velveeta: where this is explained how?
[12:55:41] <Velveeta> i don't think it's explained anywhere…….. good luck
[12:56:22] <morelli> well thanks
[12:57:06] <AhmadElMoudani> Hello
[12:57:21] <tp43_> Velveeta:  that works the second time around, but the first time around you get error "loaded is not defined"
[12:58:00] <tp43_> how do you definite it without it initializing
[12:58:09] <duch_kazatel> var loaded;
[12:58:25] <AhmadElMoudani> Let's say ajax returned an array which includes "food"... I do alert(data.food).. But how can I put a variable in there? Example: alert(data.food[variable here])
[12:58:38] <Velveeta> yeah that would work
[12:58:41] <duch_kazatel> actually, in this case you want loaded = 0;
[12:58:44] <duch_kazatel> for clarify.
[12:59:13] <duch_kazatel> AhmadElMoudani in that example, food is not a reference to an element in an array.
[12:59:28] <Velveeta> yeah i was about to say if it's a true array, it has to be numerically indexed
[12:59:34] <Velveeta> otherwise you should make it an object
[13:00:27] <shoky> `alert
[13:00:32] <AhmadElMoudani> duch_kazatel, Well technically have arrays such as food_1, food_2, food_3, etc.. then I use jquery to use a while loop with index++.. So I want to alert(data.food_index);
[13:00:32] <shoky> ?alert
[13:00:40] <shoky> silly b-ot
[13:00:47] <duch_kazatel> AhmadElMoudani so data.food is an array.
[13:00:58] <tp43_> hmm, its not workiing
[13:01:15] <duch_kazatel> AhmadElMoudani your example still doesn't make sense - that's not an array.
[13:01:17] <duch_kazatel> that's an object.
[13:01:25] <duch_kazatel> arrays have numbered indexes.
[13:01:57] <AhmadElMoudani> Okay sorry, data is an array but not data.food
[13:02:02] <AhmadElMoudani> data.food_1 is a variable
[13:02:14] <tp43_> arrays are objects
[13:02:14] <duch_kazatel> .food_1 is not a valid array index.
[13:02:21] <duch_kazatel> data[0] would be.
[13:02:33] <duch_kazatel> data.food_1 is a plain object propery.
[13:02:42] <duch_kazatel> tp43_ correct - almost everything in javascript is.
[13:02:42] <AhmadElMoudani> I understand, it doesn't need to be an array actually
[13:02:52] <tp43_> yeah, for array you have to use the [] notation, you can only use the dot notation for objects,
[13:03:04] <sekyms_> that does not seem good
[13:03:07] <AhmadElMoudani> So if I want to alert(data.food_1).. how can I use the variable index instead of the number 1?
[13:03:09] <Velveeta> yeah, neither data nor data.food are arrays
[13:03:20] <Velveeta> alert(data['food' + index])
[13:03:25] <duch_kazatel> tp43_ no, you can use square brackets - data["food_1"] is the same as data.food_1;
[13:03:26] <tp43_> data[food_1]
[13:03:41] <tp43_> duch_kazatel:  even for arrays?
[13:03:42] <duch_kazatel> velveeta had it.
[13:04:05] <duch_kazatel> tp43_ the square brackets are still object property acceessors in arrays, but they get special handling.
[13:04:31] <duch_kazatel> http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4
[13:04:34] <tp43_> duch_kazatel:  oh, thanks for letting me know
[13:04:54] <duch_kazatel> "Array Objects
[13:04:54] <duch_kazatel> Array objects give special treatment to a certain class of property names. A property name P (in the form of a String value) is an array index if and only if ToString(ToUint32(P)) is equal to P and ToUint32(P) is not equal to 232−1.
[13:05:13] <AhmadElMoudani> Ahh
[13:05:14] <AhmadElMoudani> I see now
[13:05:34] <AhmadElMoudani> So when data has things that can have a dot after, it means that's an object?
[13:05:40] <duch_kazatel> keep in mind that object properties can also be simple numbers, which is why you need to use an array literal syntax.
[13:05:42] <duch_kazatel> AhmadElMoudani yes.
[13:05:44] <AhmadElMoudani> So ajax returns (data), and that is an object, not an array
[13:05:46] <AhmadElMoudani> I see thank you
[13:05:51] <duch_kazatel> but all arrays are objects.
[13:06:00] <duch_kazatel> arrays are objects with special methods and properties.
[13:06:08] <Velveeta> what the ajax callbacks receive could be *either* an object or an array object
[13:06:13] <Velveeta> it depends on what your server is sending
[13:06:24] <Limak> need some help with this contact-us form https://gist.github.com/macpool/8425676
[13:06:25] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[13:06:43] <Velveeta> if you're using php or something and are outputting an "associative array", that's an object… unless it's numeric keys, if there are string keys involved, it's a regular object
[13:06:52] <Velveeta> arrays are strictly numeric keys
[13:07:11] <duch_kazatel> in fact, javascript doesn't have "hashes" or "associative arrays"  - those are plain objects.
[13:07:19] <Velveeta> right
[13:07:25] <duch_kazatel> which is neat.
[13:07:46] <Velveeta> same concept, just different terminology, and no doubt different implementations
[13:07:57] <duch_kazatel> sure, but the interfaces are close enough in most cases.
[13:08:04] <Limak> I want to flesh it out to validate things are report errors back - essentially just re-render the partial in the js response
[13:08:37] <Velveeta> right
[13:08:52] <duch_kazatel> Limak are you asking for help with javascript, or ruby?
[13:08:56] <duch_kazatel> or jquery?
[13:09:06] <Velveeta> yeah i was about to say, i don't see any js in that
[13:09:11] <duch_kazatel> there's one js file.
[13:09:22] <duch_kazatel> create.js.erb
[13:09:36] <Velveeta> ahhh yes, the extension threw me off
[13:09:49] <duch_kazatel> Limak i know very little about ruby and RoR (which this looks like) - you should probably go look up a tutorial.
[13:09:59] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, that's a gripe i've always had with ror.
[13:10:00] <Velveeta> and i know zero about it
[13:10:32] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/h75Sv0l.jpg
[13:10:38] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaahahahaha
[13:10:44] <duch_kazatel> the real joke is rails
[13:10:49] <Velveeta> yuuuuuuuup
[13:11:00] <Velveeta> ruby syntax looks so dirty to me
[13:11:06] <Limak> i need to put create.js.erb in order
[13:11:10] <duch_kazatel> ruby is fine-ish
[13:11:37] <Velveeta> afk helping a coworker fasttrack her testing of my code so i can deploy a patch
[13:11:39] <Limak> currently, if I submit the blank form, it shows the thanks message
[13:11:57] <duch_kazatel> Limak you'll need to hook up an event listener for the form submit.
[13:12:07] <duch_kazatel> when that fires, you'll go your validation and then go from there.
[13:13:38] <Limak> how can I put these validations is the js fle
[13:13:46] <duch_kazatel> Limak what are you validating?
[13:15:00] <Limak> you mean which fields?
[13:15:10] <Velveeta> which fields, what rules are you using to validate them, etc
[13:15:35] <duch_kazatel> Limak i mean what are you validating?  are you validating formatting, validity, existence... etc.
[13:16:46] <Limak> email with "EMAIL_REGEX" and message presence to be true
[13:17:52] <duch_kazatel> Limak then yep - capture the submit event, check your fields, then proceed.
[13:17:58] <duch_kazatel> what about the process are you stuck on?
[13:18:44] <Velveeta> BOOM! problem solved.. http://speckyboy.com/2009/12/17/10-useful-jquery-form-validation-techniques-and-tutorials-2/
[13:18:51] <Limak> I've updated the gist with contact.rb file, which include the validaters
[13:19:15] <duch_kazatel> Limak if you're looking for some sort of server-side validation, you need to read about ajax.
[13:20:09] <duch_kazatel> we're not going to be of much help as far as the ruby/rails side is concerned.
[13:20:17] <Velveeta> right
[13:20:41] <Limak> not any server side validations
[13:20:49] <cortexman1> Velveeta do you know how to get from this.input to its parent div?
[13:20:59] <duch_kazatel> Limak then why did you add a ruby file with validation rules
[13:21:04] <Limak> just to see if email is properly formatted and subject is there
[13:21:09] <Velveeta> cortexman1: this.input.parents('div:first') ?
[13:22:32] <duch_kazatel> Limak then you'll need ajax to validate on your server-side.
[13:22:42] <duch_kazatel> or you need to translate that code to javascript.
[13:22:51] <Velveeta> or else you'll need to port your server-side validation rules over to javascript to run in the browser
[13:22:54] <Velveeta> or both, really
[13:23:05] <duch_kazatel> (note: you should do both)
[13:23:20] <Velveeta> (note: read duch_kazatel's note)
[13:23:34] <duch_kazatel> :D
[13:23:37] <shoky> (note: noted)
[13:23:45] <Limak> noted ;)
[13:23:56] <duch_kazatel> dammit Velveeta we need to figure out how to get all soderberg up in this
[13:24:03] <duch_kazatel> make this witty banter instead of repeating stuff.
[13:24:25] <Velveeta> uh oh.. must.. google…. "soderberg" …………… stat!
[13:24:31] <duch_kazatel> ocean's 11
[13:24:37] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha
[13:24:59] <krastavac> is there some fancy jquery scrollbar for bs?
[13:25:13] <duch_kazatel> 'bs'?
[13:25:23] <krastavac> bootstrap
[13:26:04] <Limak> I am not sure, why we need server side validation rules?
[13:26:06] <Velveeta> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/
[13:26:25] <Velveeta> limak: you need server validation rules to validate the data you receive from the client, which can never be trusted as-is
[13:26:36] <duch_kazatel> Limak the client side can be mucked with.
[13:26:48] <jedimind> bs is about right
[13:26:48] <duch_kazatel> i can modify the javascript on your site to do as i please.
[13:26:48] <Velveeta> you want client-side validation rules to save the round trip to the server for the majority of form errors
[13:26:51] <jedimind> to describe bootstrap
[13:26:52] <jedimind> :)
[13:26:59] <Velveeta> jedimind: you got that right
[13:27:01] <tp43_> I have $("#content").on("change",".nField",function(){…, how do I do .off() for #content > .nField?
[13:27:01] <duch_kazatel> jedimind agreed.  PREACH!
[13:27:30] <tp43_> $("#conent > .nField").off("change");
[13:27:42] <shoky> tp43_ the event handler is on #content
[13:27:46] <Velveeta> your event listener isn't bound to .nField, it's bound to #content
[13:27:49] <shoky> why not read the docs?
[13:27:52] <duch_kazatel> .off( events [, selector ] [, handler(eventObject) ] )
[13:27:54] <duch_kazatel> hi.
[13:28:38] <Velveeta> we evaluated bootstrap here for about a month… what i saw under the hood………………… it shook me to my core………………………………………… i still wake up in the night screaming sometimes..
[13:28:53] * shoky holds Velveeta. we'll get through this
[13:29:04] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap is plenty okay if you want to build a bootstrap site.
[13:29:07] <tp43_> so $(".nField").off("change");?
[13:29:21] <tp43_> Velveeta:  whats wrong with bootstrap?
[13:29:25] <Limak> I am not sure if I ma getting you
[13:29:26] <duch_kazatel> if you do not want to build a bootstrap site, they slap you and say "do not leave the designated fun zone".
[13:29:27] <tp43_> I thought it was good
[13:29:30] <Velveeta> i couldn't believe that twitter developers would churn out such crap code
[13:29:41] <duch_kazatel> tp43_ dude i sent you the exact syntax you need to use.
[13:29:43] <Velveeta> tp43_: i'm talking about the js that makes it up
[13:29:56] <Limak> Its a simple contact form, where user puts any email and some message and i get the email
[13:29:57] <Velveeta> i mean twitter has money to throw at developers
[13:29:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah the js is very... special.
[13:30:08] <tp43_> duch_kazatel:  yeah but what goes in front of the .off()?
[13:30:19] <Velveeta> limak: because malicious people can alter form content so that when it gets to your server, it causes unexpected things to happen
[13:30:34] <duch_kazatel> tp43_ http://api.jquery.com/off/
[13:30:45] <shoky> tp43_:  <shoky> tp43_ the event handler is on #content  <Velveeta> your event listener isn't bound to .nField, it's bound to #content
[13:31:47] <Velveeta> web security 101 says never trust the data you receive from the client
[13:31:52] <krastavac> Velveeta: there is no scrollbar on that page, just scrollspy
[13:31:56] <tp43_> $("#content").off("change", ".nField");?
[13:32:01] <Velveeta> krastavac: then there's your answer
[13:32:39] <krastavac> I had that link opened before I asked here
[13:33:05] <shoky> tp43_ yes
[13:33:12] <tp43_> shoky:  thx
[13:33:15] <tp43_> Velveeta:  thx
[13:33:18] <tp43_> duch_kazatel:  thx
[13:33:37] <Limak> Goi it. Thanks
[13:33:45] <Velveeta> and actually, that's web security 102.. web security 101 is always validate your user's identity when accessing confidential information… i'm look at you YOU, citibank! http://consumerist.com/2011/06/14/how-hackers-stole-200000-citi-accounts-by-exploiting-basic-browser-vulnerability/
[13:33:48] <shoky> >>>>>>>>>> THX <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
[13:34:20] <Velveeta> but if you had that link opened, you should have seen that there wasn't a fancy bootstrap scrollbar
[13:34:22] <jedimind> oh man whoever built that for citibank ... i hope they got sued
[13:34:28] <cortexman1> Velveeta: thank you
[13:34:35] <Velveeta> cortexman1: no problemo
[13:35:04] <Velveeta> incidentally, web security 101 demonstrates what web security 102 teaches, never trust the data you receive from the client
[13:35:12] <krastavac> does anyone know some fancy jquery scrollbar i could use?
[13:35:24] <Velveeta> you need to be more descriptive than "fancy"
[13:35:29] <cortexman1> Velveeta, unless you are the client;)
[13:36:07] <Velveeta> if you're the client, then you're not receiving data from the client ;)
[13:37:54] <Limak> Velveeta, even if the form is accessible without logging in
[13:37:59] <jedimind> http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/
[13:38:00] <jedimind> that looks neat
[13:38:22] <duch_kazatel> Limak yes.
[13:38:23] <duch_kazatel> always.
[13:38:25] <duch_kazatel> validate always.
[13:38:28] <duch_kazatel> never trust users.
[13:38:40] <duch_kazatel> even if it's an internal only tool - don't trust your users.
[13:39:38] <Velveeta> limak: yep, even then
[13:40:29] <Ericx2x> Why do these not hide? http://jsfiddle.net/dTr49/
[13:42:39] <NoiseEee> they do, Ericx2x http://jsfiddle.net/dTr49/1/
[13:42:43] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/dTr49/2/
[13:43:02] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee and i did the exact same thing there.  welp.
[13:43:10] <duch_kazatel> well, almost exact/
[13:43:21] <NoiseEee> heh
[13:43:43] <NoiseEee> Ericx2x: choose 'jquery' as the lib you're using and tell the fiddle when to run your JS
[13:44:14] <Ericx2x> oh derp
[13:44:15] <Ericx2x> thanks
[13:46:16] <jedimind> anyone know if there's a GSAP irc home
[13:46:25] <duch_kazatel> you could always do a /list
[13:47:12] <jedimind> clearly, i didnt find anything obvious
[13:49:11] <duch_kazatel> google search and a /list turns up nothing. what is gsap?
[13:51:22] <jedimind> http://www.greensock.com/
[13:52:07] <Velveeta> i have green socks
[13:52:15] <Velveeta> that reminds me, i need to wash these white socks sometime
[13:53:10] <jedimind> are ... they the same socks?
[13:53:14] <jedimind> they started as white now they're green ?
[13:55:19] <sekyms_> jedimind for being all about eyecandy their website sure is ugly
[13:55:38] <jedimind> yup
[13:55:45] <Velveeta> who can say what color they started.. what am i, a sock …… sewer..ist?
[13:56:17] <Velveeta> i just realized i missed the damn season premiere of archer last night… this is why i can't have nice things
[13:56:43] <cortexman1> what exactly does 'autocompletechange' signify? 'Triggered when the field is blurred, if the value has changed.'  - what does "when the field is blurred" mean?
[13:56:52] <cortexman1> i'm looking to perform an action when the user presses enter.
[13:57:02] <sekyms_> when focus is lost
[13:57:07] <sekyms_> thats what blur means
[13:57:17] <grafi> lines are a bit blurry
[13:57:36] <grafi> Velveeta, head sockolist
[13:57:45] <grafi> sockengineer
[13:57:51] <grafi> sockter
[13:57:52] <grafi> xD
[13:57:55] <Velveeta> yeah that thing, what am i, a head sockolistengineerter?
[13:58:08] <duch_kazatel> cortexman1 "blur" is an event.
[13:58:28] <cortexman1> alright. what about determining when the user presses enter?
[13:58:50] <duch_kazatel> if it's a proper form, detect the form submit.
[13:58:59] <duch_kazatel> http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/blurfocus.html
[14:00:08] <BillCriswell> Working with other people's HTML stinks.
[14:01:17] <duch_kazatel> it can.
[14:01:31] * hlve slaps BillCriswell around a bit with a large trout
[14:01:58] <BillCriswell> Roughian!
[14:02:14] * Velveeta slaps hlve's large trout around a bit with BillCriswell
[14:02:14] * hlve slaps Velveeta back with an unbelievably large trout
[14:02:20] <hlve> ooo
[14:02:39] <saba> Why is it that .parents() returns the reverse order? Please see http://jsfiddle.net/HWtS3/ $('span') will return a, b, c. However $('span').parents() will return z, y, x instead of x, y, z.
[14:03:01] <duch_kazatel> saba because it's going from root to parent.
[14:03:42] <saba> duch_kazatel: and there are three roots, right?
[14:03:48] <duch_kazatel> it goes "up" the tree, so-to-speak
[14:03:56] <sekyms_> thats what she said
[14:04:02] <duch_kazatel> aaaahahahaha
[14:04:03] <saba> it's a matter of how .parents() reads the array of [a, b, c]
[14:04:12] <shoky> parents()[0] === parent()
[14:04:25] <shoky> parents()[1] === parent().parent()
[14:04:27] <shoky> etc
[14:04:36] <Velveeta> yeah that doesn't really fit his fiddle though
[14:04:40] <Velveeta> all the nodes are siblings
[14:04:52] <duch_kazatel> it's backwards - i'd expect that.
[14:04:53] <NoiseEee> saba http://jsfiddle.net/HWtS3/1/
[14:04:56] <Velveeta> has me kind of confused
[14:05:01] <duch_kazatel> since it's all about bottom to top.
[14:05:01] <NoiseEee> saba: *if* thats the way you want it.
[14:05:10] <duch_kazatel> both depth and tree position.
[14:05:13] <duch_kazatel> if that makes sense.
[14:05:58] <Velveeta> it should be based on depth, but i would think siblings would execute in the order they're encountered in the dom
[14:06:02] <saba> NoiseEee: no, I want it to be z y x. However I don't know why it's reversed and I need to rely on the reverse order always being reverse (in future versions).
[14:06:22] <saba> duch_kazatel: please see my fiddle
[14:06:31] <duch_kazatel> to me, going in reverse order is consistent.  i'd want it to go from bottom to top, deep to shallow.
[14:06:52] <duch_kazatel> saba i did.
[14:07:14] <Velveeta> i would expect it to go top to bottom, deep to shallow
[14:07:36] <Velveeta> just because when you assemble a standard jquery collection, it's top down
[14:07:44] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/parents/ - "... the resulting set will be in reverse order of the original elements as well, with duplicates removed."
[14:07:54] <saba> Velveeta: exactly
[14:08:00] <BillCriswell> Documentation, how about that.
[14:08:01] <Velveeta> $('span') should be a/b/c, and .each() should execute in that same order and encounter the first .parents(), then the 2nd, then 3rd
[14:08:04] <duch_kazatel> the docs are pretty explicity about it.
[14:08:15] <Velveeta> ahaaaa there's the explanation
[14:08:15] <duch_kazatel> *explicit
[14:08:33] <duch_kazatel> i'd be really confused if it did it the other way personally, but meh.
[14:09:24] <saba> duch_kazatel: why should it be reversed?
[14:09:50] <duch_kazatel> to me, the functionality to be the reverse of .find()
[14:10:01] <duch_kazatel> *should be the reverse of
[14:10:07] <tp43_> how can I select an input with class=".nField" and name="someName"?
[14:10:26] <duch_kazatel> input.nField[name="someName"]
[14:10:39] <duch_kazatel> or just .nField[name="someName"]
[14:10:52] <BillCriswell> tp43_: input[class=".nField"]
[14:10:55] <BillCriswell> I guess?
[14:11:01] <BillCriswell> That seems like an error.
[14:11:20] <duch_kazatel> input[class=".nField"] - that's going ot incur a bunch of extra overhead by trying to parse class=.
[14:11:30] <duch_kazatel> input.nField will get you the same thing.
[14:11:42] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's class=".nfield" though.
[14:12:10] <duch_kazatel> tp43_ you do know you shouldn't use a period in your class=, right?
[14:12:15] <duch_kazatel> because that's really off.
[14:12:33] <shoky> he's not
[14:12:46] <duch_kazatel> how can I select an input with class=".nField" and name="someName"?
[14:12:55] <duch_kazatel> that's what they asked...
[14:12:57] <shoky> i'm sure that's not what he means..
[14:13:10] <BillCriswell> ¯\(°_o)/¯
[14:13:12] <duch_kazatel> probably <input class=".nField" and name="someName">
[14:13:14] <shoky> especially cause he was talking about delegating with ".nField" as selector
[14:13:48] <BillCriswell> This all sounds like magic.
[14:13:56] <Velveeta> the darkest magic
[14:14:00] <duch_kazatel> you're right - programming is hard.
[14:14:39] <tp43_> BillCriswell:  thx

[14:33:15] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to fade all other images on hover of one image, but right now I'm only getting all the siblings in one ".row" to fade. Any idea how I get all the "#work .four" to fade? http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/UdxA5/
[14:35:23] <Azure> I guess nobody can help me? :p
[14:35:23] <Azure> (Or just that nobody saw it.)
[14:35:47] <duch_kazatel> Azure huh?
[14:36:22] <duch_kazatel> radiantstatic  - try this: http://jsfiddle.net/UdxA5/1/
[14:37:35] <Es0teric> ok so i am doing e.target.addClass() and still its telling me that its undefine
[14:37:35] <grafi> Azure nobody saw it :P
[14:37:36] <Es0teric> d
[14:37:54] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric code?
[14:37:58] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel
[14:38:01] <Es0teric> give me a sec
[14:38:24] <Azure> >[Jan14/14 04:02:29PM]  Azure:	 I have a bunch of divs that has a linked image (that takes up the entirety of the div) and a nested div that is overlaid on top of part of the image/link when I hover over the div.
[14:38:24] <Azure> >[Jan14/14 04:02:57PM]  Azure:	 When the linked image is clicked, a lightbox pops up.
[14:38:25] <Azure> >[Jan14/14 04:03:57PM]  Azure:	 When I am on a phone/tablet, I know that I can intercept ontouchstart and call preventDefault to stop the lightbox from popping up the first time.
[14:38:25] <Azure> >What I want to do is when I tap away from the div, the overlaid items should disappear.
[14:38:25] <Azure> >http://pastie.org/8633509 And sample JS and html.
[14:38:42] <radiantstatic> duch_kazatel: that unfortunately just fades everything and then doesn't return the second row. I think I know what's up!
[14:38:50] <radiantstatic> duch_kazatel: but much thanks for the help!
[14:38:55] <duch_kazatel> radiantstatic did you see the change though?
[14:38:55] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:39:00] <duch_kazatel> sometimes you just need the kick.
[14:39:15] <radiantstatic> duch_kazatel: lol, yes. I did see it. You are my muse.
[14:39:21] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel -> http://pastebin.com/d0q4GTGc
[14:39:22] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaahahahhaa
[14:39:30] <Es0teric> thats the code without $(document).ready()
[14:40:06] <Velveeta> es0teric: e.target is a dom element reference, you need to wrap it in a jquery constructor to use .addClass on it
[14:40:18] <Es0teric> Velveeta say what?
[14:40:30] <Velveeta> $(e.target)
[14:40:42] <Es0teric> does that actually work?
[14:40:53] <Velveeta> yes...
[14:41:06] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric welcome to jquery.
[14:41:12] <duch_kazatel> you need to "jquerify" objects.
[14:41:19] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i havent used jquery in a while
[14:41:24] <Es0teric> i been doing mostly backend work lately
[14:41:25] <Velveeta> you could do $(a.b.c.d.e.f.g) if you wanted, so long as that was a valid object page, and .g pointed to something jquery could wrap
[14:41:37] <Velveeta> page=path
[14:41:38] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric that lets them inherit the jquery methods.
[14:41:46] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel thats interesting
[14:42:02] <duch_kazatel> the thin returns an object that inherits the methods you want.
[14:42:38] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok then so how do i make it remove the class on the current target after another target is clicked?
[14:43:08] <duch_kazatel> can i get a fiddle faddle?
[14:43:16] <duch_kazatel> nvm i see it.
[14:43:41] <Velveeta> for one thing, you can use .css on a collection, you don't have to .each your way through it, and you can limit that selector scope like this: $('.nav li.active').removeClass('active')
[14:43:53] <Velveeta> .css will automatically iterate over the collection for you
[14:44:07] <duch_kazatel> woah yeah - don't use .each whenever you can get away with it.
[14:44:12] <Velveeta> and by adding the class name to your selector, you don't need to check if .hasClass
[14:44:20] <duch_kazatel> jquery does it for you.
[14:44:29] <duch_kazatel> jquery silently does things for you to make your life easy.
[14:45:27] <Velveeta> it's like the 3rd stepmom i never had
[14:45:39] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[14:48:14] <zeroquake> [16:43] <zeroquake> http://jsfiddle.net/9qZp2/1/  --- hey  --- i am trying to have dynamic variables i mean --- data.xxx ---- how can i do it
[14:48:21] <duch_kazatel> data[xxx]
[14:48:32] <duch_kazatel> object property access notation.
[14:49:22] <dj21> let's say i want to reparent an element to div.body on event B, and then put it back exactly where it was on event A.  how do i do the second?
[14:51:07] <scoT_T> Es0teric: Here http://jsfiddle.net/2zy4P/
[14:52:36] <scoT_T> Es0teric: Is that what you meant?
[14:53:39] <duch_kazatel> dj21 you have to record where it was.
[14:54:35] <scoT_T> dj21: Make a reference to its parent: http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[14:54:57] <duch_kazatel> dj21 the other option is to clone it and hide the original.
[14:55:25] <duch_kazatel> and then delete the clone and unhide it.
[14:55:30] <duch_kazatel> but that's dertayyy
[14:56:46] <dj21> parent and element number, i guess
[14:58:09] <Velveeta> dj21: here's an example how you can do that: http://jsfiddle.net/B8Z7e/
[15:00:13] <Velveeta> and on that note, it's time fo rme to gtfo before traffic gets too horrible
[15:04:46] <Azure> Eh.
[15:09:21] <Tomashe> Hey guys
[15:10:15] <Tomashe> im new to jquery mobile, and wondering if someone can help me out. ok so the thing is like that, i want to trigger ajax event into my php file to load the new html and recieve the correct data from server and only when its done to show it
[15:10:24] <Tomashe> i could not find anything usefull in the docs
[15:10:27] <Tomashe> anyone can help me out
[15:10:28] <Tomashe> ?
[15:13:05] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe dunno about jquery mobile, but there should be an ajax function with a success callback.
[15:14:01] <Tomashe> u mean just a regular jquery post function
[15:14:10] <Tomashe> that will trigger the click() after its done ?
[15:14:52] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe huh?  don't use post, use $.ajax();
[15:15:05] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe you can do whatever you want in the success callback.
[15:15:22] <duch_kazatel> no idea what the jquery way is though.
[15:15:34] <duch_kazatel> err, *jquery mobile
[15:18:35] <Tomashe> heheh
[15:18:37] <Tomashe> ok mate
[15:18:38] <Tomashe> thanks
[15:21:44] <Es0teric> scoT_T yes that is exactly what i meant, thanks man
[15:22:06] <Es0teric> scoT_T i know it was late but i have had a few brew bottles lol
[15:23:31] <scoT_T> Es0teric: No worries ;) I could use a few myself :D just FYI, the .click() method will actually go through each element matching that selector (noticed you had the .each in there) - so no need to do that.
[15:27:25] <webfox_> Hello folks!
[15:27:48] <webfox_> Could someone point me to a good slider tutorial please?
[15:27:56] <duch_kazatel> "slider" ?
[15:28:11] <duch_kazatel> like a carousel?
[15:28:17] <webfox> duch_kazatel: yes
[15:28:20] <duch_kazatel> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[15:28:22] <duch_kazatel> this is a good one ;)
[15:30:50] <Azure> ... Trying a third time.
[15:30:50] <Azure> I disabled a linked image from navigating with .preventDefault which allows a hidden element next to it to appear without bringing up a lightbox. (via :hover on the parent element)
[15:30:50] <Azure> What should I do in order to dismiss the hover (or whatever it would be on mobile) by tapping away from the parent element?
[15:31:02] <webfox> Can I use this same code?
[15:31:20] <duch_kazatel> webfox did you not actually read the site...?
[15:31:47] <duch_kazatel> Azure you'll have to manually bind an event on the background that removes the pseudoclass.
[15:31:54] <webfox> duch_kazatel: yes, but I am here to accomplish this not be asking about it otherwise I will miss the milk.
[15:32:08] <duch_kazatel> "i will miss the milk" wat
[15:32:17] <webfox> duch_kazatel: what would you use instead of a carousel then?
[15:32:26] <duch_kazatel> nothing.,  i'd redesign.
[15:32:31] <duch_kazatel> if you need a slider, bxslider is a thing
[15:32:33] <webfox> duch_kazatel: I will not get paid man.
[15:32:42] <duch_kazatel> carousels are bad design imo.
[15:33:45] <Azure> So I would have to bind a function on click/touchstart/whatever and somehow get rid of it?
[15:33:45] <tw2113> i liked bxslider for my time with it
[15:33:54] <webfox> duch_kazatel: the first site you've showed me uses lib/jquery.ui.rcarousel.min.js
[15:33:57] <Azure> bind a function to document on*
[15:34:11] <duch_kazatel> webfox that's probably the jqueryUI version.
[15:34:22] <duch_kazatel> Azure prolly.
[15:35:15] <webfox> duch_kazatel: yes, this bxslider seems cool. I will try it. Thank you to point me to that.
[15:38:40] <Azure> I see...
[15:38:48] <Azure> brb restarting modem.
[15:38:51] <duch_kazatel> Azure what you're doing seems... strange.
[15:38:56] <duch_kazatel> i'd need a code sample.
[15:40:52] <Azure> duch_kazatel: http://pastie.org/8633509
[15:41:28] <duch_kazatel> Azure can you supply a working example using jsfiddle please?
[15:42:37] <Azure> I could if connecting to websites worked on here at the moment. hm...
[15:42:48] <duch_kazatel> errr...
[15:42:50] <duch_kazatel> then fix that?
[15:42:51] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:43:23] <Azure> "Can't assign requested address".
[15:43:52] <duch_kazatel> wat
[15:44:01] <duch_kazatel> sounds like not a javascript problem?
[15:44:14] <Azure> No it's not.
[15:44:32] <Azure> My network stack died or something.
[15:44:40] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[15:46:59] <Azure> Going to restart.
[15:59:22] <Azure> there
[16:16:17] <Azure> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/mseymour/eaxxU/
[16:19:52] <duch_kazatel> azure wait what is this supposed to do?  because your use of "one" is odd.
[16:21:12] <Es0teric> scoT_T oh wow i didnt even know that.. thanks man
[16:30:57] <Azure> duch_kazatel: Not sure. I was looking for a way to block clicks only on touch events and that's what I found.
[16:31:34] <duch_kazatel> Azure what are you trying to accomplish?
[16:32:36] <Azure> Block navigation on the first tap on mobile devices so then my social/etc. links can be tapped on.
[16:33:05] <Azure> And then dismiss the overlaid elements by tapping elsewhere.
[16:33:38] <Azure> They already dismiss by tapping on another div with the same class.
[16:34:12] <duch_kazatel> Azure this code sample does not look complete.
[16:34:52] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to make a touch-friendly drop-down nav.
[16:34:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah?
[16:35:01] <Azure> That's because I haven't implemented the code to stop preventDefault.
[16:35:12] <Azure> I suppose so.
[16:35:56] <Azure> I do have doubleTapToGo.js, however I haven't been able to get it to work on .item
[16:36:23] <Azure> http://osvaldas.info/drop-down-navigation-responsive-and-touch-friendly
[16:37:28] <Azure> (scroll down to "Touch-friendly drop-down navigation")
[16:37:51] <duch_kazatel> yup i was looking at that.
[16:38:18] <duch_kazatel> what aren't you getting?
[16:40:02] <Azure> I'm not sure what selector I should use for it.
[16:40:21] <Azure> I *guess* just $('.item').doubleTapToGo()?
[16:42:20] <Azure> Or also target the parent as well (in my case, a section named .items): $('.items .item')
[16:42:37] <flexd> Uh, is there a easy way to format numbers within editboxes?
[16:42:42] <flexd> inputboxes*
[16:43:26] <flexd> Hm, I found https://github.com/teamdf/jquery-number/ maybe that will work good :-)
[16:43:56] <Azure> It might just be a problem with Lightbox though.
[16:43:57] <duch_kazatel> azure whatever the parent dropdown elements are/
[16:46:04] <Azure> Well, considering that it's not a navigation dropdown but rather individual items, like Pinterest.
[16:47:04] <duch_kazatel> Azure wait so this is a modal?
[16:47:47] <Azure> Well, obviously Lightbox2 is modal.
[16:48:04] <duch_kazatel> are you using jquery mobile?
[16:48:12] <Azure> No, just normal jQuery.
[16:48:35] <duch_kazatel> i’d use a lib that does what you want - look at jqmodal.
[16:49:42] <Azure> Well, if you look at the fiddle that I linked, that's how I have it set up.
[16:49:58] <duch_kazatel> Azure why not use JQmodal?
[16:50:40] <Azure> All that I need is a simple popup that displays the linked image in my item, which is why I'm only using Lightbox2.
[16:50:46] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/eyoosuf/jqModal - seriously this will do everything you need.
[16:51:24] <duch_kazatel> your current plugin is apparently not doing what you need.
[16:52:20] <duch_kazatel> unless lightbox2 handles all this stuff for you.
[16:53:05] <duch_kazatel> which it looks like it does.
[17:00:47] <aharris6> Hi all, having trouble with jquery syntax for selecting an element but NOT an associated psuedo element. Something like: $('.ui-slider-handle:not(.ui-slider-handle:after)')
[17:01:26] <Azure> Hm...
[17:01:32] <duch_kazatel> aharris6 you want  $('.ui-slider-handle:not(:after)')
[17:02:20] <aharris6> @duch_kazatel that is giving me the same error as the previous:
[17:02:21] <aharris6> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: after
[17:03:05] <duch_kazatel> what about  $('.ui-slider-handle').not(‘:after’);
[17:03:14] <duch_kazatel> if not that, please supply a code example.
[17:03:24] <duch_kazatel> a more complete one with the html you’re working against.
[17:03:32] <shoky> you can't select pseudo elements with jquery i think..
[17:03:51] <shoky> or use them in a selector
[17:04:09] <duch_kazatel> sure you can - $( "input:not(:checked) + span" ) works.
[17:04:22] <shoky> where's the pseudo?
[17:04:23] <aharris6> but maybe not before/after?
[17:04:25] <duch_kazatel> hrm, is :checked considered a psuedo?
[17:04:28] <shoky> no
[17:04:34] <shoky> `api :checked
[17:04:36] <b-ot> shoky: :checked Selector: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[17:04:40] <aharris6> error said "unsupported pseudo" so maybe that is that
[17:04:41] <shoky> it's part of the API
[17:04:46] <Azure> I do suppose that there are probably better solutions for what I want to do out there.
[17:04:53] <duch_kazatel> derp then nope, psuedos are not supported.
[17:05:03] <duch_kazatel> Azure you want to make modals - you’re using a library for modals.
[17:05:08] <duch_kazatel> not sure what’s so hard.
[17:05:18] <aharris6> well crud, thanks y'all
[17:05:28] <Azure> I guess I forgot to mention that the page is pretty much a large gallery.
[17:05:43] <duch_kazatel> sure.  click an image and it opens in a modal?
[17:06:06] <Azure> Yeah.
[17:06:13] <duch_kazatel> that’s what lightbox does.
[17:06:30] <Azure> Lightbox also allows going between individual items in a group. Does jqmodal?
[17:06:47] <Azure> s/items/images/
[17:06:48] <duch_kazatel> nope.  lightbox looks like exactly what you need.

[17:45:49] <duch_kazatel> are you getting an error of some kind?
[17:46:44] <dj21> does it mess up a manual transmission car to jam on the brakes on the highway?  or do you just have to press the clutch at the same time
[17:48:22] <duch_kazatel> you should press the clutch at the same time.
[17:49:21] <dj21> that sounds dangerous to drive
[17:49:29] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[17:49:41] <FriendlySeal> does js have default arguments

[17:49:54] <dj21> FriendlySeal: yes, undefined
[17:50:00] <FriendlySeal> thats weak
[17:50:05] <duch_kazatel> FriendlySeal not in the way you’re thinking.
[17:50:10] <dj21> if you need to overload refer to keyword arguments
[17:50:21] <duch_kazatel> you can create a big object and pass that around instead.
[17:50:26] <dj21> or pass in an object
[17:50:46] <FriendlySeal> how is object diff
[17:50:49] <FriendlySeal> the argumetns
[17:50:53] <FriendlySeal> array
[17:50:56] <dj21> arguments is an array, object is an object
[17:51:09] <dj21> key/val vs numbered index
[17:51:25] <duch_kazatel> arrays are objects, etc.
[17:51:32] <dj21> yes
[17:52:51] <dj21> FriendlySeal: go to a console -- function f(){ return arguments; } f(1,2,6,2);  function g(obj){ return obj; } g({a:1},1,2);

[19:00:20] <NBhosting> it doesnt seem to find the fields
[19:02:37] <jAyenGreen> looking at http://pastebin.com/btxu1KTP, why when I click the button does the ajax fire but the success does not, I get a prototype Uncaught RangeError despite there being no $ in my code And the noconflict
[19:10:22] <dekiss> do you know some good scroll bar that I can use?
[19:10:47] <FriendlySeal> outsource it
[19:20:35] <walidvb> guys, i'm trying to implement a parralax on my site, but the fact that i have a really long page, and multiple background images is making it difficult, don't know how to go about it...
[19:22:22] <walidvb> i followed a tutorial, my problem now is that the images that are way down on the page are way too far background-position-y up by the time you get there
[19:22:26] <walidvb> here is the link:
[19:22:36] <walidvb> http://vbbros.net/blumer/
[19:23:44] <walidvb> and my code is the following:
[19:24:11] <walidvb> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/825a5a2f3c24b60dc846
[19:27:24] <GoSox> so i've read several times, that web browsers have their own internal queue of 4 simultaneous http connections at once. so if you try to do more than that in an app, they'll get queued by the browser even if your code would have them all run at the same time.
[19:28:05] <GoSox> is there a way javascript can 'get' this value? so i can look up how many simultaneous connections a browser can make, and only try to do that many things at once
[19:32:19] <KevinEldon> Hi everyone. Is it cool if I ask for some help w/ a JQuery Mobile challenge I'm facing?
[19:33:48] <KevinEldon> I'm hoping silence is a 'yes'.
[19:34:06] <utomox> Don't ask to ask, just ask
[19:34:09] <utomox> :P
[19:35:08] <coldhead> i don't think that is accessible in JS, GoSox
[19:35:25] <coldhead> maybe some browsers might share that information but not in a standard way
[19:35:57] <jkingaround> anyone know of a image wall that scrolls when you move your mouse?
[19:36:26] <jkingaround> basically have a ton of movie posters i want to display and when you move around it'll move the posters that are in view
[19:36:30] <KevinEldon> So here's the problem. I start my app (Cordova 3 based app). If need to display a login page if the user is not authenticated otherwise just display the first page of the app. What's the right way to do this?
[19:36:55] <KevinEldon> Thx utomox.
[19:37:49] <GoSox> this sounds like a php question
[19:37:53] <Velveeta> kevineldon: wouldn't user authentication be handled on the server side?
[19:38:30] <utomox> thats server side KevinEldon
[19:38:52] <utomox> either node/php
[19:38:55] <KevinEldon> Yes, the actual authentication is, but the application will keep a session token in local storage.
[19:38:57] <Velveeta> gosox: the concurrent connection limit is different for each browser, but if you queue up more requests than it allows, it'll just process them as it finishes others, so there's no need to try to throttle them yourself
[19:39:36] <KevinEldon> So if the user leaves the mobile app and the phone OS kills the app the user doesn't have to reauthenticate for a few hours/days.
[19:39:43] <GoSox> Velveeta: but i don't want it to look like my app is doing 10 things when it's really doing 4, you know? it would just be nice to be able to custom tailor it to whatever "your" browser's limits are
[19:39:50] <Velveeta> gosox: it can gets around that limit though, if it's tricksy about it, precious.. oh yes.. if it's tricksy...
[19:40:06] <GoSox> huh?
[19:40:40] <KevinEldon> Anyways... maybe I've provided too much unneccessary detail... is there a good way to choose between two possible "first" pages in JQuery Mobile?
[19:40:53] <Velveeta> if you have control of your dns entries, and if you don't mind having a wildcard subdomain (or you could specify additional specific subdomain entries for this purpose) you can modify the urls you're requesting from to point to a.domain.com, b.domain.com, c.domain.com, etc
[19:41:18] <Velveeta> the concurrent connection limit is only a given server, if you split your requests across multiple subdomains that point to the same server, it will process them all
[19:41:30] <GoSox> interesting
[19:41:57] <Velveeta> i used to use that trick at an old company i worked for, i'd split them up 2 at a time and send 2 to a., 2 bo b., etc
[19:42:05] <Velveeta> pages loaded like *that* <snaps>
[19:44:18] <Velveeta> kevineldon: i'm not too familiar with jqmobile, but i would think that since it loads each page and stores old pages as you click links (i think) there should be some way that at load time, you can check for that session token, and just tell it to load one page or another
[19:44:18] <GoSox> is there some obvious typo in this little function? it is failing, without any error messages, and i'm not seeing why
[19:44:19] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/7vMJj/
[19:44:46] <GoSox> crap i see it now
[19:44:50] <GoSox> line 6 :)
[19:44:58] <Velveeta> ahh yes :D
[19:45:09] <GoSox> i am way too tired to be working on things
[19:45:13] <GoSox> and yet
[19:46:49] <KevinEldon> Thanks Velveeta.
[19:47:25] <Velveeta> i don't know how much help that was, but hopefully it at least gave you an idea
[19:48:02] <scoT_T> GoSox: You a PHP developer by any chance?
[19:48:17] <GoSox> yeah..... i say... with a little bit of fear
[19:48:25] <scoT_T> ;)
[19:48:29] <scoT_T> just had a feeling
[19:48:29] <scoT_T> hehe
[19:48:30] <GoSox> GoSox == WhatsMyIP.org
[19:48:37] <GoSox> oh the $variable names
[19:48:38] <GoSox> :)
[19:48:57] <scoT_T> :D
[19:49:03] <scoT_T> yup
[19:49:06] <GoSox> ive been doing php for too long
[19:49:16] <GoSox> if it doesn't have a $ in front of it, my brain doesn't see it as a variable
[19:49:31] <GoSox> the day i learned you could start variable names with $ in javascript... was a very happy day for me
[19:58:17] <GoSox> oh so how do you bind a click event to future elements of a particular class?
[20:00:39] <walidvb> i'm completely lost. I'm using masonry, that I have used before, but somehow it won't work on this site... I keep getting 2 columns instead of three.
[20:01:06] <walidvb> here is the link: http://vbbros.net/blumer/#/#projects
[20:01:07] <phiz> GoSox: .on()
[20:02:17] <walidvb> 'm really going crazy over this one, i can't figure out what css property makes it behave this way..
[20:07:05] <shoky> walidvb: i'm seeing 3 columns.. i think
[20:07:12] <walidvb> shoky: argh
[20:07:25] <walidvb> shoky: oh, sry didn't update the server
[20:08:08] <walidvb> should be 2 now(even though I have seen 3 in the past)
[20:08:47] <shoky> still the same
[20:08:50] <walidvb> still not... let me get back to you, very sorry
[20:10:22] <Velveeta> have you ever been so thirsty that you actually started eyeballing the bottle of sriracha next to you?
[20:10:31] <Velveeta> just because it's liquidish?
[20:11:08] <GoSox> wtf is sriracha
[20:11:15] <shoky> hot sauce
[20:11:16] * Velveeta gasps.
[20:11:20] <walidvb> shoky: now it is
[20:11:22] <shoky> no water there?
[20:11:24] <Velveeta> about the greatest gift to mankind
[20:11:33] <Velveeta> well, i *do* have this gatorade next to me also..
[20:11:40] <walidvb> i like min sweeet
[20:11:41] <Velveeta> but i'm trying to save that for later
[20:12:50] <walidvb> shoky: i had a ul with lis before, changed that to divs hoping it would do the trick
[20:13:38] <shoky> walidvb: also before, masonry wasn't really working, and now it sorta is
[20:13:53] <walidvb> yes, i had disabled it actually
[20:14:03] <walidvb> and changed stuff, and tried other plugins
[20:14:09] <walidvb> no luck nowhere..
[20:14:14] <shoky> well.. make smaller changes
[20:14:20] <shoky> so you know what causes it
[20:14:27] <Velveeta> according to theoatmeal's sriracha quiz, i'm 88% addicted
[20:15:15] <walidvb> shoky: i could never get it wo work on this site, and i can't find the cause of it, that's the thing... i tried removing all bootstrap classes, nothing
[20:20:35] <GoSox> so if i have a function that runs some commands, then ends by calling itself, and it runs in this loop lets say, tens of thousands of times, is that going to cause a huge memory leak?
[20:21:06] <GoSox> would it be better to call itself via a setTimeout?
[20:21:09] <GoSox> with say, a 1 ms timeout
[20:21:34] <walidvb> GoSox: defo
[20:21:40] <walidvb> but why so fast?
[20:21:43] <GoSox> defo?
[20:23:34] <walidvb> definitely timeout
[20:23:42] <GoSox> ok
[20:25:57] <walidvb> shoky any clue?
[20:26:12] <walidvb> `seen shoky
[20:26:12] <b-ot> walidvb: I saw shoky 2m 11s ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[20:29:26] <walidvb> any hints on where to look? been googling all night, it's 5:28 here :D
[20:38:43] <aharris6> hi all, trying to determine if each div in an .each loop already has a specific div within it, and if not, create that div within. I can't get the if statement correct
[20:38:53] <aharris6> https://gist.github.com/alexharris/c9e9cf2599967821918f
[20:39:06] <aharris6> need to replcae the this:contains('swatch') bit
[20:42:43] <walidvb> shoky: oyou back? :)
[20:44:06] <shoky> walidvb: ye.. i dont really know the cause of that issue. could be your angular directive for the masonry stuff is too simple
[20:44:36] <walidvb> shoky: using it through console gives the same result.
[20:48:27] <walidvb> shoky: but thanks for checking. i'll give up on that, i guess.
[20:52:29] <GoSox> in Chrome's dev tools, how can I stop a script thats running?
[20:58:13] <grok_linux> feel like i'm missing something obvious...any particular reason jquery ajax would keep appending to tbody even if i call empty() before the .html(data)?
[20:58:26] <dekiss> anyone have experience with sliders - https://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/blob/master/src/javascripttest.rb
[20:58:57] <grok_linux> firebug shows it's only returning the data requested
[20:59:10] <shoky> walidvb: it works if you make the widths a bit smaller. e.g. 32% and 64%   donno how masonry works really, or what input it needs
[20:59:32] <walidvb> shoky: i thought i'd tried that...
[20:59:43] <walidvb> erm.. dunno what to say.. thanks a lot, man
[20:59:46] <walidvb> shoky++
[21:00:04] <shoky> np ;p
[21:06:04] <scoT_T> aharris6: something like this should work
[21:06:11] <scoT_T> aharris6: //jsfiddle.net/Xtp5F/
[21:06:26] <scoT_T> aharris6: Sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/Xtp5F/
[21:07:16] <aharris6> scoT_T: ah, ok thanks. I wasn't doing the length bit..that could be key
[21:07:24] <aharris6> i was thinking if would return true if that exist at all
[21:16:19] <GoSox> so instead of doing real work tonight
[21:17:18] <GoSox> i sat here making a tool (for private use only) that lets you enter in a series of SPAM urls (meaning urls advertised in spam emails), and it gets them, over and over again, 4 at a time, as fast as it otherwise can. And it shows you how many requests it's made, and how many MB of data it has downloaded
[21:17:48] <GoSox> in the hopes that 1) hopefully spammers pay for their hosting and 2) the large burst of traffic will hopefully help bring attention to the spammy web page on the system its hosted on
[21:29:56] <abishek> how to show animated number incrementing using jquery
[21:30:19] <GoSox> $i++; $("#counter").html($i);
[21:42:13] <GoSox> Hmm is there a way you can trick javascript into loading a separate url. Like creating an inline frame, and loading a non-local url into that frame, all while keeping the frame invisible
[21:50:26] <nights> hi
[21:50:34] <nights> im having an issue with firefox
[21:50:34] <coldhead> G'DAY NIGHTS
[21:50:41] <nights> hi
[21:51:08] <nights> im loading part of my form by a jquery ajax call, that works fine in chrome, but in firefox part of my form is missing
[21:51:18] <nights> its very consistant
[21:51:52] <nights> is there a difference worth mentioning between chrome/firefox ajax loaded content?
[21:54:26] <coldhead> no
[21:55:03] <coldhead> nights: errors like that are often from a bug in your HTML
[21:55:09] <coldhead> can you show us the code?
[21:58:59] <nights> coldhead: thanks. you mean an html issue in the loaded content? i will have a look first, its a lot of cleanup work to post it here
[21:59:17] <andromedian> i want to move a rocket through a path any plugins?
[21:59:35] <coldhead> nights: yes, an html issue in the loaded content
[21:59:41] <coldhead> a missing " or > or some such
[22:00:30] <nights> good tip
[22:00:32] <nights> i will have a look
[22:03:02] <nights> coldhead: the thing is
[22:03:10] <nights> even if i load just one row
[22:03:50] <nights> by ajax, and then load nothing and then load this row again, it stops working.
[22:04:05] <nights> so html in the loaded content should be correct
[22:04:11] <coldhead> do you see an error in the console?
[22:04:18] <coldhead> in uh firebug?
[22:04:55] <nights> hmm
[22:05:00] <nights> i can see what the error is now
[22:05:04] <nights> but im not sure why it happens
[22:05:24] <nights> whenever i do this load , the form tag jumps to surround to the loaded form field
[22:05:46] <nights> even though there are lots of non ajax-loaded form fields
[22:06:14] <nights> this does not occur in chrome
[22:07:01] <nights> could it be a html error in the non ajax-loaded part?
[22:07:13] <nights> or why would the form tag decide to move?
[22:08:40] <nights> probably just need to get rid of the form tag
[22:08:51] <nights> hm
[22:09:02] <nights> or, no that wont be possible ;_;
[22:12:28] <coldhead> nights: however it happens, your code is probably producing invalid html
[22:12:40] <coldhead> and different browsers have different ways of trying to fix it for you
[22:13:23] <nights> coldhead: ok, so atleast firefox isnt suppose to do what it does? then i will just search for the error
[22:14:05] <ftj> Anyone have experience with videojs? I'm building a page that has a video player with a few thumbnails below. When you click a thumbnail, it swaps in the proper video tag for the video associated with the thumbnail and autoplays. It works great for the first three clicks, but after that, videojs fails to initialize, but doesn't throw an error or anything. Here's all the code that's making this happen (short JS file):
[22:14:05] <ftj>  https://gist.github.com/franktisellano/1e3bb219a379129b3c78
[22:14:26] <coldhead> nights: if the browsers are behaving differently it's usually because you have invalid html
[22:14:48] <coldhead> some browsers handle broken markup better
[22:18:00] <nights> coldhead: i dont think its broken html, atleast not as in broken tags etc
[22:18:15] <nights> ive stripped the checkout form down to just the form and one ajax loaded field
[22:18:34] <nights> and its still moving the form tag to right before that ajax-loaded field
[22:19:05] <nights> i will try to render without all footers and etc
[22:22:44] <coldhead> nights: are you trying to insert fragments of html?
[22:22:57] <coldhead> like add a <form> and later add a </form> ?
[22:23:22] <nights> no
[22:23:27] <coldhead> okay
[22:23:31] <nights> i have <form> ...form content... </form>
[22:23:35] <coldhead> i'm out of ideas then
[22:23:40] <nights> and that form content is switched in by ajax
[22:23:41] <nights> ok
[22:23:42] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQUery
[22:23:46] <nights> hehe
[22:24:02] <nights> ive seen your expertice here before
[22:24:04] <nights> but
[22:24:12] <nights> its not my first day either
[22:24:15] <nights> so im pretty lost
[22:24:18] <nights> anyway
[22:24:23] <nights> im down to like 10 lines soon
[22:24:27] <nights> so hopefully i can solve it
[22:24:38] <coldhead> soon you will have 0 lines and can't start again
[22:24:39] <nights> binary debugging style
[22:27:32] <nights> ok
[22:27:35] <nights> same thing with 10 lines
[22:27:40] <nights> fuck firefox
[22:27:52] <nights> more people must be running into this
[22:31:13] <nights> coldhead, one thing, actually it doesnt move the form tag, it makes a copy it
[22:31:27] <nights> exact copy, with the same id and everything
[22:42:15] <nights> coldhead: i found it ;)
[22:42:21] <nights> not a html problem though
[22:43:31] <coldhead> good work nights !
[22:44:09] <nights> coldhead: thanks. it seems i somehow returned a duplicate of the form in the ajax content
[22:44:17] <nights> and chrome sorted that out by ignoring it
[22:44:22] <nights> while firefox printed it inline
[22:45:04] <nights> anyway
[22:45:06] <nights> thanks for the support
[22:45:19] <coldhead> always a pleasure, nights
[22:45:25] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your life
[22:45:47] <nights> hehe
[22:46:05] <nights> you too, coldhead
[22:47:41] <nights> may it bring happy moments as you walk humbly covered in light among the lesser jquery coders
[23:26:55] <donCams> hi. how do I select all elements with .someclass even those that are dynamically created?
[23:27:31] <shoky> donCams you can't select elements that do not exist at the time you're querying the DOM
[23:28:36] <donCams> so basically I have to run the script again when the element is created? i was hoping there was some function like .on() but that only works when I am listening for events
[23:29:14] <shoky> if it's not event-based, then yeah
[23:29:16] <donCams> .on('event', 'child-element', function(){}); runs even when child-element was dynamically created
[23:29:24] <donCams> too bad. thanks :)
[23:29:25] <shoky> right, but that doesn't select any element that doesn't exist
[23:29:35] <shoky> it just waits for events to bubble up and checks where they bubbled up from
[23:29:52] <donCams> ohhh. yeah. forgot JS101 :)
[23:51:21] <Junior> yello ;)
[23:54:19] <FilipNortic> Hi
[23:55:30] <FilipNortic> What trigger do I want for an event that suppose to trigger when a user paste a long string into a field?
[23:57:18] <Cork> FilipNortic: paste
[23:57:58] <Cork> FilipNortic: you might need to use a timer if you want to see the updated field
[23:58:30] <Cork> $().on('paste', function() { var self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { console.log(self.val()); }) })
[23:58:38] <dekiss2> anyone can help?
[23:58:43] <dekiss2> can't function in 9 am :S
[23:58:47] <dekiss2> my brain is dead
[23:59:04] <shoky> try again later
[23:59:52] <FilipNortic> Cork: I tried paste, can my problem be that I seem to be  using jQuery 1.4
