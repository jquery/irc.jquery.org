[00:00:12] <MrTool> lenswipee: im not sure but make a console.log on the select, i think there is an attribute called options which is an array
[00:06:15] <lenswipee> is console.log possible in IE9?
[00:07:05] <Cork> yes
[00:07:17] <Cork> but only when the developer view is open
[00:09:07] <lenswipee> Cork: Can you tell me how to do console.log in IE9. I know about hitting f12 to open developer tools
[00:09:31] <lenswipee> Cork: the jquery code
[00:09:43] <Cork> open the developer tools
[00:09:47] <Cork> and run console.log in the code
[00:10:00] <Cork> if you close the developer tools console.log will be undefined
[00:11:08] <lenswipee> Cork: so the code is simple console.log?
[00:11:15] <Cork> yes
[00:11:55] <lenswipee> Cork: i want to log this: $option
[00:12:12] <lenswipee> Cork: $option.console.log?
[00:12:17] <Cork> uh...
[00:12:27] <Cork> you know how console.log normally works right?
[00:12:32] <lenswipee> Cork: when i alert $option i get object
[00:12:41] <Cork> yes
[00:12:46] <lenswipee> Cork: so i want to log it so i see
[00:12:48] <Cork> the console just supports text
[00:13:02] <Cork> you need to serialize it first
[00:13:03] <lenswipee> Cork: never used console.log bro
[00:13:06] <Cork> and dom isn't possible
[00:13:11] <Cork> O_o
[00:13:16] <Cork> wow
[00:13:29] <Cork> console.log('hello');
[00:14:29] <lenswipee> Cork: $option is a string/text
[00:14:39] <lenswipee> console.log($option)
[00:14:42] <lenswipee> i suppose
[00:14:53] <daanavitch> lenswipee: console.log($option)
[00:15:04] <Cork> why do you have $ on it if it's a string ?!?
[00:15:20] <daanavitch> I think he's mixing up php and javascript
[00:16:01] <lenswipee> Cork: Nah, its a dom
[00:16:06] <Cork> ...
[00:16:14] <Cork> "<lenswipee> Cork: $option is a string/text"
[00:16:20] <daanavitch> lenswipee: wouldn't that be $(option)?
[00:16:21] <Cork> make up your mind
[00:16:23] <lenswipee> I was wrong
[00:16:29] <lenswipee> mind now made up
[00:16:39] <lenswipee> so how to see this dom?
[00:16:42] <Cork> you can't console output dom in a meaning full way in ie
[00:17:04] <lenswipee> or alert it
[00:17:05] <Cork> the best you can do is console.log($option[0].outerHTML)
[00:17:08] <Whiskey> no one
[00:17:21] <Cork> but that won't give you the dom
[00:17:33] <Cork> just a html'ified version of it
[00:21:38] <lenswipee> 		var $input = jQuery('<input id="addOption" />').blur(function (e) {e.preventDefault();});
[00:21:56] <lenswipee> the e.preventDefault() isn't working
[00:22:21] <lenswipee> I can see it processing server-side
[00:22:24] <Cork> you can't prevent a user from moving focus that way
[00:22:45] <Cork> blur is triggered AFTER the focus has been moved
[00:23:19] <Cork> i think $(this).focus() would work though
[00:23:30] <Cork> though i think is a bad idea to implement something like that
[00:24:20] <lenswipee> 		var $input = jQuery('<input id="addOption" />').blur(function (e) { $(this).focus();});
[00:24:26] <lenswipee> is that what you mean, cork?
[00:24:58] <Cork> try it and see
[00:26:07] <lenswipee> nothing has changed
[00:26:36] <Cork> you might have to use a timer
[00:26:50] <Cork> but why do you want to prevent the user from moving focus from the input?
[00:27:07] <Cork> you'll just make the page annoying to use
[00:28:20] <lenswipee> Cork: Lets start again. From what I can tell the blur event is not firing because when i click anywhere outside of input nothing happens
[00:28:47] <Cork> blur only happens when focus is moved to another element that can take the focus
[00:28:59] <lenswipee> Cork: This was 100% working before. Maybe upgrading to IE 9.
[00:29:12] <xec_> blur should happen when it loses focus
[00:30:03] <Cork> yes, and focus is lost when another element get focus
[00:30:11] <Cork> *gets
[00:30:20] <Cork> you can't lose focus to nothing
[00:30:23] <xec_> you don't need another input
[00:30:31] <Cork> never said you did
[00:30:38] <Cork> but you need a focusable element
[00:30:43] <xec_> you can lose focus to "body"
[00:31:00] <Cork> no body doesn't have focus, window can have it though
[00:31:13] <lenswipee> further information, when i click on a tab on the same page the input is still on focus. seems locked in
[00:31:33] <lenswipee> the jquery tab is responsive though
[00:32:12] <lenswipee> now swithing back to ie8 and see what happens
[00:32:42] <xec_> Cork: okay, so what are you saying exactly
[00:33:15] <Cork> xec_: that if you are in a situation where you click doesn't populate to an element that can have focus; you don't get blur
[00:33:31] <xec_> but you still lose focus?
[00:33:46] <xec_> what situation would that be
[00:33:49] <Cork> only if something triggers focus on an element that can have focus
[00:34:14] <Cork> ex if you have a hierarchy where a bit up in it you preventDefault on a div
[00:34:31] <Cork> if you click a child there the window won't get the click event, and there by no focusin event
[00:34:37] <Cork> and your input field won't get a blur event
[00:34:47] <Cork> all i said is clicking outside isn't enough
[00:34:57] <Cork> you have to make sure another focusable element gets focus
[00:35:12] <Cork> if that doesn't happen blur won't trigger
[00:35:43] <xec_> but window will get focus by default by "clicking outside"
[00:35:55] <Cork> in the normal case it doesn't differ much from what you said, but you can get in situations where that assumption fails
[00:36:03] <Cork> if click gets to it yes
[00:36:16] <Cork> the problem is you can get into situations where it doesn't
[00:36:28] <Cork> and that was the hole point of my argument
[00:36:49] <Cork> "blur only triggers if another elements gets focus"
[00:36:51] <lenswipee> Cork: Seems like i'm going to have to move away from blur)!
[00:37:07] <Cork> lenswipee: blur isn't really your problem
[00:37:30] <Cork> though what is your problem is a bit hard to say without seeing it
[00:38:54] <xec_> Cork: "where click is prevented"? like this? http://jsfiddle.net/bGa5a/
[00:39:08] <xec_> ?demo @ lenswipee

[00:39:26] <lenswipee> xec_: it's working now
[00:40:00] <lenswipee> was $('<option>', {})
[00:40:03] <lenswipee> now
[00:40:04] <Cork> xec: i don't have the exact flow in my head but no there is more to it that that
[00:40:06] <lenswipee> jQuery('<option>', {
[00:40:17] <lenswipee> that fixed it
[00:40:53] <Cork> uh what does option have to do with input ?!?
[00:41:35] <Whiskey> I think what the problem is, if i remove the text from div, it be correct when it first load the page, but during the time ticking and its get smaller and use more width then it need in the td, it donÂ´t manage to read that out
[00:41:58] <Whiskey> as i have a tick in it to read it every second, can be cuz the old results of width is saved or something
[00:42:17] <Whiskey> as it donÂ´t change to the current width
[00:42:29] <lenswipee> Cork: the option wasn't added with the input data, so when blur was fired nothing happened.
[00:42:48] <lenswipee> Cork: Anyway, the whole thing is a real mess.
[00:42:51] <xec_> lenswipee: afaik you can't "blur" an option, you blur the select
[00:43:32] <lenswipee> xec_: well apparently you can because it's firing.
[00:43:43] <Cork> hmm definitely true cross browsers
[00:43:51] <Cork> but i think some browsers support blur on options
[00:44:13] <lenswipee> if ie8 supports it, ild say they all do
[00:44:23] <xec_> http://jsfiddle.net/utLZc/
[00:44:39] <xec_> in latest chrome and firefox, only the select is fired
[00:44:51] <lenswipee> jQuery('<input id="addOption" />').blur(function (e) {
[00:44:58] <xec_> IE too
[00:44:59] <lenswipee> do it like this and it might work better
[00:45:13] <Cork> lenswipee: <input> !== <option>
[00:45:40] <lenswipee> gosh i did it again. made myself look stupid.
[00:45:58] <lenswipee> long day man
[00:48:19] <Cork> opps correction it is click and mousemove not focus/blur
[00:48:56] <lenswipee> Cork: sorry?
[00:49:13] <Cork> some browser support binding click and mousemove events on option elements
[00:49:16] <Cork> some doesn't
[00:49:43] <Cork> for the other browsers you need to bind it on the select element and then check offsets and other weird things
[00:50:01] <Cork> (clientX and clientY)
[00:50:32] <Cork> actually haven't tested in newer ie's
[00:50:44] <Cork> but i'm quite sure ie was the one that didn't support it
[00:53:15] <syskk> how can I tell $.ajax to send my data as a stringified json object?
[00:53:25] <Woet> syskk: read the docs
[00:53:37] <syskk> I did
[00:53:41] <syskk> I tried dataType: json
[00:53:43] <syskk> didn't work
[00:53:49] <Cork> data: { json: JSON.stringify(data) }'
[00:54:07] <Cork> dataType is a hint for the data comming back from the server
[00:54:16] <syskk> ok
[00:54:16] <Cork> but the content-type the server sets wins
[00:54:26] <Cork> if you want to send json you need to encode it your self
[00:54:30] <Woet> "The type of data that you're expecting back from the server."
[00:54:35] <Woet> as mentioned in the docs.
[00:55:13] <syskk> mmmm ok
[00:55:57] <syskk> im just wondering why jquery doesnt convert true to 1 or something like that
[00:56:04] <syskk> i obviously dont want to send a string...
[00:56:21] <Cork> why json can have true false
[00:56:40] <Cork> and 1 isn't always the same as true
[00:56:43] <syskk> yes I mean with regular post
[00:57:03] <Cork> doesn't it send it as true/false?
[00:57:07] <syskk> so my best option is { data: JSON.stringify(object) } ?
[00:57:13] <Cork> no
[00:57:28] <Cork> { data: { json: JSON.stringify(object) } }
[00:57:36] <Cork> you need a key to hold the json string
[00:57:52] <syskk> mmm
[00:58:02] <Cork> else the server will puke on the string parsing
[00:58:20] <syskk> I don't think so, not with content type json
[00:58:31] <Cork> depends on the server
[00:58:56] <syskk> right
[00:59:25] <Cork> but the web standard is to have the data www encoded
[00:59:36] <Cork> that means key=value params

[02:15:47] <xec_> Nancy2012: the alot says you are welcome :)
[02:15:57] <Nancy2012> :)
[02:16:03] <Cork> man it's annoying when you sit and fiddle with somethings for hours; gives up; comes back the next day and types out a working line the first thing you do...
[02:16:21] <Cork> makes you wonder what you did the day before...
[02:16:35] <xec_> coke?
[02:16:54] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/gbyGg/11/
[02:17:33] <grafi> thats always a good feeling though
[02:18:23] <dumbdell> can you guys let that fiddle run for a while then click back to in about 15-30 minutes and tell me if it running correctly
[02:18:30] <seutje> Cork: I get that feeling every time I look at code I wrote over a week ago
[02:18:43] <Cork> dumbdell: again, fix your page it is broken
[02:18:50] <seutje> or friday afternoon code in general
[02:19:00] <Cork> add the default unprefixed css value at least
[02:19:33] <dumbdell> cork which browser do you use as a mater of fact.. :) i know my code is not fully cross compatible yet but I only just got it to work :)
[02:19:35] <Cork> seutje: well it's not so much about the code being bad, as incapability of solving the problem
[02:19:52] <Cork> dumbdell: ie, opera, firefox <-- none of them work with you page
[02:20:05] <Cork> and chrome the only one it works in == page is REALLY broken
[02:20:48] <Cork> you page == your page
[02:21:05] <dumbdell> how is the page brken in chrome?
[02:21:07] <seutje> Cork: well, I've noticed I come up with some quick & dirty solutions on fridays that make me puke & refactor on monday
[02:21:13] <Cork> dumbdell: uh.. read again
[02:21:19] <Cork> it ONLY works in chrome and safari
[02:21:48] <dumbdell> o yeh.. well yeah.. its fine for Webkit browsers in its current development state
[02:21:50] <Cork> dumbdell: just add the freeking standardized css values
[02:22:07] <dumbdell> I just need to test now one last thing that the window.focus is keeping the time correct between tab/window switches
[02:22:10] <Cork> it takes like... 1min and 40 sec
[02:22:34] <motaka3> hello using this code I try to load css/js/html all together I need firt to be sure that the js is loaded completely and then if necceessary I'd like to insert html in the page, I have heard I can do this using $.when.apply but more I read abiou it less I understand. Can anyone tell me how I can fix it? For several days I am engaging this  http://codepaste.net/3pmean
[02:23:35] <Cork> motaka3: tip separate the question and the backstory into two separate lines; makes it a LOT simpler to find what your problem is
[02:24:01] * dumbdell goes to prefix the rest of the css so Cork may be a happier camper
[02:24:41] <Cork> dumbdell: i'm just a bit on the edge when webkit centric web developers slowly breaks the web standard
[02:25:12] <motaka3> Cork: I dont understand
[02:26:00] <Cork> motaka3: parsing 5 lines of continuing text to find the question takes a lot longer then having the question separately and then skimming the story to find the data you need to answer the question
[02:26:44] <dumbdell> building a fiddle and describing the problem in 1 line works good too ;D
[02:26:58] <motaka3> Cork: My english is not good enough to understand you, what does skimming means ?
[02:27:14] <Cork> motaka3: speed reading through the text
[02:27:27] <motaka3> Cork: Whats the solution ?
[02:27:47] <Cork> write the question so it becomes simple to find it
[02:28:03] <Cork> and add the rest of the information separately
[02:28:47] <Cork> do as you want; but i usually just ignores those big text blobs, cause it takes to much time to find what the other party wants
[02:30:01] <motaka3> Cork: Please fix my code - thats all I want it is just several lines. After u have it fixed I will study it
[02:36:34] <k_sze[work]> How do I test if an object is a jqXHR?
[02:37:59] <Cork> k_sze[work]: obj.readyState !== undefined
[02:40:26] <k_sze[work]> Some people on StackOverflow also suggest checking whether it is a promise object.
[02:43:10] <Cork> k_sze[work]: that works depending on what you want to differentiate it from
[02:45:10] <wilkinsmc> does form action always look in the root folder for a php file?
[02:45:17] <k_sze[work]> I guess that, for my use case, either method is fine. Because the alternative will have neither readyState nor the Promise interface.
[02:45:49] <Cork> wilkinsmc: look??
[02:45:53] <Cork> it doesn't look anywhere
[02:46:09] <Cork> it reference the same url formats like any other form
[02:46:16] <Cork> full, absolute, and relative
[02:46:29] <wilkinsmc> so action is a url?
[02:46:32] <Cork> yes
[02:46:42] <wilkinsmc> so i guess i have to put ..
[02:46:43] <wilkinsmc> ../
[02:46:43] <Cork> it's client side
[02:46:47] <Cork> what else would it be
[02:46:56] <wilkinsmc> always root
[02:47:17] <Cork> /file would be always root
[02:47:28] <Cork> == absolute
[02:47:52] <mathi> hi
[02:48:38] <wilkinsmc> dot dot slashin it up

[03:03:01] <wilkinsmc> lol
[03:05:10] <j_wright> jay_: there are channels containing sql (and mysql) knowledge

[03:08:56] <EdwardIII> hrm i'm working on someone else's project here, when i register for .change on a selectbox it triggers constantly heh
[03:09:01] <EdwardIII> can't figure out why
[03:09:14] <EdwardIII> it uses the jquery ui dropdown widget
[03:09:58] <motaka3> Cork: It is solved
[03:10:09] <motaka3> Cork: Do u want to see the solution ?
[03:10:16] <vst332> can I just do @keyframes name { }  .. and then prefix actuall frames rather then creating whole lumps of keyframe code for each browser?
[03:10:25] <motaka3> Cork: ?
[03:10:43] <Cork> vst332: you need to repeat everything for every browser
[03:10:51] <Cork> motaka3: na
[03:10:58] <motaka3> Cork: No?
[03:14:12] <vst332> k just looking at it through IE 9 lol

[03:32:56] <lemonsparrow> hi one simple doubt... I have successMsg('succ', "3 URL moved successfully"); and 3 is in a variable... how to interpolate it into the string in js ?
[03:32:56] <vst332> I cant be responsible for making bafoon browser work on every scrap of code the interweb pukes out because microsoft programmed it in the 1 million chimps on typerwritters department
[03:34:09] <xec_> lemonsparrow: successMsg('succ', myVar + " URL moved successfully");  ?
[03:36:30] <lemonsparrow> xec_: worked thanks :)
[03:36:57] <uwjesq> Just doing this is crazy or not? jQuery("#qty").change.....    I do need for the document to be ready. Don't I?
[03:38:00] <xec_> uwjesq: depends. if #qty is in the html before the script is included, it should be fine
[03:38:01] <systemfault> No, the element must exist at the moment that line is called though.
[03:45:38] <Mosselmaniac> hi all

[03:46:29] <Mosselmaniac> but I defined that in the head, inside the $(document).ready(function(){
[03:46:58] <fabioportieri> put it outside then
[03:47:12] <Mosselmaniac> I'm calling that function from outside there
[03:47:15] <fabioportieri> you don't need function to be available at document.ready
[03:47:15] <Mosselmaniac> is that all lol
[03:47:17] <fabioportieri> that's it
[03:47:32] <fabioportieri> that's the error
[03:47:46] <Mosselmaniac> wow, noobish

[04:00:11] <BadCodSmell> Is it possible to have jquery serialise js type to http query params in such a way that true -> "1" false -> "0" rather than true -> "true", false -> "false" ?
[04:00:29] <BadCodSmell> It would be a minor convenience.
[04:00:55] <BadCodSmell> Hmm actually let me see if I can override Boolean.toString or something
[04:01:20] <Cork> BadCodSmell: no you would have to do that your self
[04:06:29] <BadCodSmell> Boolean.prototype.toString = function() { return (+this.valueOf()).toString()} doesn't work :(, I guess I have to use the source
[04:08:44] <seutje> BadCodSmell: guess u could monkeypatch it to change the bools to strings and then run the original function
[04:09:20] <seutje> note that this can severely confuse the developer after you though
[04:10:38] <BadCodSmell> monkey patch on encodeURIComponent
[04:11:31] <BadCodSmell> Yes it could, the alternative seems to be to patch apache/php to support json params and post
[04:12:02] <Cork> BadCodSmell: why not just get the data as a normal param and then decode it server side?
[04:13:04] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { data: { json: JSON.stringify() } }); $data = json_decode($_POST['json'])
[04:13:59] <BadCodSmell> It's just not as convenient, confusing or sadistic.
[04:14:17] <Cork> heh
[04:14:40] <Cork> man i hate that there isn't a way to write fallbacks in css -_-'
[04:14:59] <seutje> oh, I actually meant monkeypatching $.fn.serialize
[04:15:24] <lemonsparrow> I am calling a method in one js file inside another... things were working fine until some time later when I now refresh the page I get ReferenceError: method_name is not defined in the console
[04:16:21] <Cork> lemonsparrow: too little context
[04:16:44] <Cork> where are you loading the files, and preferably show the code
[04:17:17] <lemonsparrow> Cork: also the method is working for some events in same page but throws errors for few other event handlers
[04:17:36] <Cork> so prob a scoping problem or race
[04:18:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: oh wait.. no the method is completely not available
[04:18:59] <BadCodSmell> lemonsparrow: window.sleep = function(s){var d = new Date();while(d - new Date() < s * 1000);} sleep(10);
[04:19:11] <lemonsparrow> its a simple error msg showing method defined in a file
[04:19:29] <BadCodSmell> otherway aroundthough
[04:19:49] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I am invoking it in another js file by passing correct arguments including error msg it was working until some time before I made few changes in the error messages
[04:20:02] <Cork> lemonsparrow: where are you loading the resources?
[04:21:17] <CausaMortis> Does anyone know where I can find a decent example for jquery mobile to generate dynamic pages? I have found a few myself but seem to be unable to add the page to document.body and change to it :s
[04:21:28] <CausaMortis> let me set up a jsfiddle, moment
[04:21:33] <lemonsparrow> CausaMortis: script src inside html head
[04:21:57] <Cork> ok, and no management lib or anything?
[04:22:06] <Cork> like require.js
[04:23:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no
[04:23:21] <Cork> and the declaration is in the first file?
[04:23:23] <uwjesq> How come my alert in jQuery(document).ready(function() {... never gets called, but when I put it ouside there, it gets called?
[04:23:41] <Cork> ?p @ uwjesq
[04:23:41] <bot-t> uwjesq, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:24:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but I am not finding the file in which the method is defined in firebug now in html
[04:24:38] <uwjesq> lol
[04:25:02] <Cork> that would explain a few things :)
[04:32:13] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yeah had missed to load that js above the invoking js file :P
[04:35:00] <newtothis> hi guys, i have two questions (well many more but... ;p):
[04:35:13] <newtothis> is there a work for js like pythonic is to python?
[04:36:46] <Cork> and what is pythonic ??
[04:39:45] <CausaMortis> anyone care to have a look? I´m using jsrender to generate the html and hopefully inject content I fetch with a json request but for some reason jquery mobile wont execute the change page or add the html to the body: https://gist.github.com/CausaMortis/ef1fcd6ed25c3a91051b
[04:39:58] <newtothis> Cork, the "proper way to write" python code?
[04:40:12] <Cork> newtothis: then no, there isn't
[04:40:56] <xybrek> Hello anyone can give some insight on making Jquery work with GWT: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16669085/making-jquery-ui-plugin-work-with-errai
[04:41:08] <Cork> there is quite a list of best practices, but not really anything dictating how you should write
[04:41:25] <newtothis> Cork, i see ^^*
[04:43:03] <newtothis> i wanted to do a simple circular left travel over an array for example, but -1 % 5 is still -1 in js. so i can't really write index = (index-1) % arr.length and have to write index=(index+arr.length-1)%arr.length and i was wondering if there's a well, simpler way to write it?
[04:43:36] <adibhanna> hey, when i use ajax to take the data from database and then add it to my page using $("#text").html(html); it's not taking the encoding of the page. (the data taken from the database has a different encoding, it should end up in arabic)
[04:43:40] <adibhanna> what to do?
[04:44:56] <Cork> adibhanna: update the server to send the data encoded in utf8
[04:45:34] <Cork> the data sent doesn't include encoding so it will be interpreted as the current encoding
[04:45:56] <Cork> and that is why you should always have the page, server side and database in unicode mode
[04:46:06] <seutje> unicode all the things!
[04:46:17] <Cork> yes sire!
[04:46:22] <seutje> whoa there
[04:50:01] <Cork> seutje: http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/100000/80000/5000/100/185147/185147.strip.gif
[04:50:35] <seutje> haha
[04:51:00] <seutje> not sure I like what you're implying :P
[04:51:09] <Cork> XD
[04:52:27] <fabioportieri> ahah
[04:55:02] <newtothis> when was plan9 developed? how are we still not all using unicode? >_<
[04:55:45] <CausaMortis> Any thoughts https://gist.github.com/CausaMortis/ef1fcd6ed25c3a91051b? I realise this might be a bit basic but i´ve digging through google search results for a few days now and its slowly driving me crazy (if I wasnt already)
[04:55:48] <Cork> uh, everyone sane does
[04:56:24] <Cork> CausaMortis: and the question?
[04:57:10] <CausaMortis> the question is, why wont my example work. I found some code online and even a working example but when I try to add a page to my body (jquery mobile) dynamically using jsrender nothing happens
[04:57:27] <Cork> and what part isn't working?
[04:57:35] <Cork> you posted dead code remember
[04:57:38] <CausaMortis> there are two newpage variables
[04:57:40] <Cork> or actually
[04:57:48] <CausaMortis> one doesnt work and the other one does
[04:58:16] <seutje> what provides this render method?
[04:58:20] <CausaMortis> jsrender
[04:58:24] <seutje> jsrender I assume?
[04:58:25] <seutje> ok
[04:58:37] <CausaMortis> correct :) alerting newpage outputs the html
[04:59:06] <CausaMortis> and i can even pass data to render( data ), which overrides the placeholders correctly, in this example I have left it out
[04:59:26] <CausaMortis> however the html is not added to the document.body
[04:59:39] <CausaMortis> let me dig up a working example
[04:59:59] <seutje> ur sure it supports not passing any arguments?
[05:01:32] <CausaMortis> passing data doesnt change anything so I assume it does. I tried passing an object and it replaces the placeholders but doesnt add the page to the document.body
[05:01:56] <CausaMortis> same result when I dont give it any arguments
[05:02:24] <seutje> CausaMortis: doesn't it just return a string of html?
[05:02:41] <seutje> cause strings don't have an appendTo method
[05:03:11] <seutje> try reversing it to $.mobile.pageContainer.append(newPage); that should work for both strings and jQuery collections
[05:03:55] <CausaMortis> Thanks, will try that
[05:05:43] <CausaMortis> that doesnt seem to work either. it also breaks the example code that does work
[05:07:08] <quietschie> hi, what is the best way to apply css information to a not-yet created element? Is there a event for onInstantiation()? Or can i inject sth in the css-whatever?
[05:12:01] <CausaMortis> what im trying to do is convert this abomination of code (yes, i suck when it comes to jquery and phonegap, and yes I realise most phonegap developers will hate me for using jquery mobile) https://gist.github.com/CausaMortis/f3911fc652da8d679962 into a single page setup that adds the content dynamically depending on the content that is fetched. Any suggestions as to what you would do to achieve this?
[05:12:35] <CausaMortis> i mean, depending on the link that is clicked
[05:13:02] <lemonsparrow> what is wrong in the syntax here ? $('#select,#PublisherMov,#revisedveID').val('');
[05:16:01] <seutje> quietschie: not sure what ur getting at, do mean off-DOM DOM nodes?
[05:18:33] <quietschie> sry, seutje, i don't know what you mean with off-DOM DOM nodes...i'm creating some spans dynamically and they should use some css. Is there a way to append the css with Jquery, or is it more convenient to create a extra css file and load it at load time?
[05:20:52] <seutje> quietschie: preferably you'd just add classes that are already defined in the CSS, alternatively, u can just $('<span>').css({ 'height': '200px', 'color': 'blue', ... })
[05:21:32] <seutje> if ur applying it to a lot of collections, u can do like $element1.add($element2, $element3, ...).css(cssObject)
[05:21:46] <seutje> doesn't matter if they're off-DOM or not
[05:22:04] <quietschie> ok, thank you!
[05:48:48] <tankblergh> Anyone experience with Knockout here? I'm making a custom binding, in which I'm trying to use ".css" to find the style of a spesific node. If finds the node, but the css data seems to be missing at this stage, because I get nothing in return. How can you run these custom bindings after the dom  page has loaded the page?
[05:51:48] <lemonsparrow> hi I have something like this
[05:51:50] <lemonsparrow> <div> <label>Current URL:</label> <span id="urlOfSelectedSiteId">www.jq2.com</span> </div>
[05:51:53] <lemonsparrow> but alignment is wrong... span is coming a lil above the label.. how to correct it ?
[06:14:18] <jay> hello need solution
[06:14:19] <jay> select p.destination, p.city, p.pax, count(*) as p, sum(h.rate) as r from tbl_package p, tbl_hotel h  where p.package_name='$package_name' AND p.package_id='$package_id' AND p.destination = h.destination AND p.city = h.city AND p.hotel_type = h.hotel_type  GROUP BY city
[06:14:53] <jay> this query gives sum of two pairs 8000 and 14000
[06:15:11] <jay> i want sum of 8000 + 14000
[06:15:22] <jay> how can i do this in php?
[06:19:23] <Kingsy> what is wrong with this --> http://pastie.org/7938906 <-- it says timeout is not declared. I assume its something to do with the scope?
[06:23:41] <syskk> Kingsy: yes, declare your timeout variable outside
[06:23:42] <rbs> guys, I have a datatables, working perfectly, just 1 problems that I can't figure out since yesterday, it is not paginating..... (if i change it to bServerSide false it paginates all records) http://paste.laravel.com/sGH
[06:24:09] <syskk> var timeout; jQuery('.products-grid li.item').hover(function() {
[06:24:09] <syskk>                 timeout = setTimeout(function() {
[06:24:33] <rbs> it shows the first 10 I return on my JSON, and I have all needed info {"sEcho":1,"iTotalRecords":124,"iTotalDisplayRecords":10,"aaData": i think it is some kind of bug?
[06:33:38] <Kingsy> syskk: yeah got it thanks
[06:38:17] <Bloomberg> Guys I have a sets of inputs like :: <input name="op[]" type="checkbox" value="1"/>
[06:38:49] <Bloomberg> I'm getting them like this :: 'op':$(this).children('input[name="op[]"]').val()
[06:38:54] <Bloomberg> but doesn't works
[06:39:05] <Bloomberg> How will be thist?
[06:39:08] <Bloomberg> thi*
[06:39:11] <Bloomberg> this*
[06:44:29] <pachet> Bloomberg what do you expect that .val() to return?
[06:48:34] <jay> i have a problem in PHP....plzzz help
[06:50:18] <c4ptnh00k> jay: This channel is for JQuery questions. Please keep it relevant. If you have specific php questions, please go to #php.
[06:57:53] <newtothis> i want to insert something at point i in an array and remove everything afterwards, is there a better way than arr.splice(i, arr.length - i, something_to_insert)? is there another syntaxt for "replace the rest of the array" rather than putting arr.length-i there?
[06:59:10] <Assim_Build> almost got this working but i must be missing some silly thing somewhere. http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/8/ so drag one of the list items from the boxes section over to the dotted line and see it inserts a new box but when trying to trag another box inside that boxes dotted line it doesn't appear to grab it. Can someone else see what I'm missing?
[07:02:02] <c4ptnh00k> Assim_Build: so I'll need to look into more indepth, but what is happening is that your events are happening for the parent element but not the child elements that are dynamically created when you drop them into the box
[07:02:25] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: that is correct
[07:02:50] <c4ptnh00k> Assim_build: ok well Give me a few. lol you got alot here.
[07:03:36] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: hehe, srry try to keep it simple, you can ignore the getNew method and section for #Filters li[varType] if it helps
[07:04:54] <c4ptnh00k> please explain what you are trying to do in js lines 36-40
[07:05:58] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: basically right now you only see the general filters option but there are 5 categories and each have other filters with similar names, so that is just looping through to grab a shortened description of the filter to be visible in the filter box
[07:06:07] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: i think I may have just discovered the problem...
[07:06:30] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: i never call the droppable function in my getBox method...silly ...
[07:06:43] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: no wait
[07:06:44] <Assim_Build> i do
[07:06:47] <Assim_Build> pft
[07:07:01] <wilkinsmc> you guys ever run into box shadow not working in firefox?
[07:07:03] <wilkinsmc> won't work for some reason
[07:08:00] <c4ptnh00k> Im thinking when you add the new content to the parent you are not appending the right attributes to the children
[07:08:44] <c4ptnh00k> wilkinsmc: normally its because you didnt add all the variations of box shadow to you css
[07:09:23] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: which ones are you thinking of?
[07:10:18] <c4ptnh00k> nvm i see it at the end
[07:10:19] <wilkinsmc> figured it out
[07:10:34] <wilkinsmc> i added a "-" to the beginning that shouldn't have been there
[07:15:58] <c4ptnh00k> hmmm lol im stumped
[07:16:42] <Assim_Build> me too, I tried adding the droppable after it was loaded but still not responsive
[07:17:44] <Assim_Build> it has something to do with being nexted inside
[07:17:57] <Assim_Build> when i bring it out it recognizes drop area
[07:19:25] <c4ptnh00k> well i think we need to modify this to append to the n-th child, but this thought process is incomplete
[07:20:30] <c4ptnh00k> lol wait
[07:21:06] <c4ptnh00k> are we just appending an li to a ul?
[07:21:19] <Assim_Build> no we're appending a div to a div
[07:21:55] <Assim_Build> the li has a variable inside an 'each' method that's a dynamically generated div
[07:22:05] <Assim_Build> (ie fresh)
[07:22:28] <c4ptnh00k> ... still early
[07:22:33] <Assim_Build> indeed :)
[07:22:42] <Assim_Build> gotta be fresh :P
[07:23:59] <Assim_Build> well there goes my theory....i can't reproduce it...
[07:25:42] <Assim_Build> i don't know if it would be easier to transform this into a sortable now or figure out why it's not working first, haha
[07:25:47] <Assim_Build> maybe making it sortable will fix the problem
[07:25:56] <Assim_Build> because my end goal is to be able to move filters from box to box
[07:25:58] <Bloomberg> Like this is well?
[07:26:00] <Bloomberg> 'op':$(this).children('input[type="checkbox"]').val()
[07:26:12] <Bloomberg> <input name="op[]" type="checkbox" value="1"/>  ::  for this input
[07:26:47] <Bloomberg> There are 7 inputs like that for each one day of the week
[07:27:01] <Bloomberg> So, I need to get the value, So 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
[07:27:28] <Bloomberg> About which checkbox is checked
[07:29:20] <shoky> Bloomberg: .val() gets you the value for the first element only
[07:29:37] <Joseph_Silber> $(this).children('input[type="checkbox"]').map(function (i, e){ return e.value }).get();
[07:29:41] <c4ptnh00k> Bloomberg: you need to loop through them and chech the "checked" poperty of the control. Im tied up right now but will look into it when i can
[07:29:51] <Joseph_Silber> $(this).children('input[type="checkbox"]').map(function (i, e){ return e.checked }).get();
[07:29:54] <shoky> might wannt change that to .children(':checkbox:checked')
[07:30:09] <shoky> still with e.value
[07:30:23] <Bloomberg> .children(':checkbox:checked') like this works
[07:30:24] <Joseph_Silber> Which will return an array of Booleans
[07:30:25] <Bloomberg> ?
[07:30:58] <shoky> Bloomberg: yes
[07:31:03] <Assim_Build> hey shoky's in. Maybe you can help us track down what's going on here? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/12/ when dragging a logical box (ie NOT) into the dotted line it prepends a new logical box, but that box's droppable area is not firing for some reason
[07:31:23] <c4ptnh00k> Lol assim I was just going to suggest you shoot it his way
[07:31:29] <Assim_Build> hehe :P
[07:32:20] <Assim_Build> for simplicity you can ignore js lines 21-52
[07:32:31] <Assim_Build> I was working on that before now i'm focusing on the logic stuff
[07:39:54] <shoky> Assim_Build:  you need to call .droppable only after it's in place
[07:40:10] <shoky> Assim_Build: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DMedb/13/
[07:40:42] <shoky> i mean, after you do the cloning
[07:41:03] <c4ptnh00k> but now you only go one level the third is not droppable
[07:41:12] <shoky> cloning a jquery-ui widget doesn't usually work
[07:41:29] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: true
[07:41:31] <Assim_Build> shoky: I see....
[07:41:44] <shoky> easy to fix that
[07:42:11] <Assim_Build> that's a matter of recursing
[07:42:18] <Assim_Build> which it looks like you started making, shoky
[07:43:11] <shoky> yeah
[07:43:20] <shoky> forgot to finish it :p
[07:43:25] <Assim_Build> hehe :P
[07:44:32] <Assim_Build> one other problem this poses though
[07:44:41] <Assim_Build> I'll now have to sort out which ones are filters and which ones are boxes
[07:44:47] <Assim_Build> not a big deal just one thing to do
[07:45:00] <c4ptnh00k> well and this is why I sit in this channel. Always something to learn. even if its what not to do lol
[07:45:03] <Assim_Build> eventaully I'll have to do another layer for what's dragged from the filters list and what's being resorted around
[07:46:19] <shoky> fun http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DMedb/14/
[07:47:23] <Assim_Build> shoky: yay! you beat me and added a few things I wasn't thinking of
[07:47:31] <Assim_Build> thanks :)
[07:47:35] <shoky> ;]
[07:47:48] <c4ptnh00k> box inception :)
[07:48:01] <Assim_Build> well, let's see adding the filter will probably work fine
[07:48:18] <Assim_Build> the makedroppable function will just operate on an empty jquery object in that case
[07:48:31] <Assim_Build> it appears to work fine
[07:48:35] <Assim_Build> :)
[07:49:06] <Assim_Build> ok, next task make this thing a sortable
[07:49:13] <Assim_Build> thanks again shoky :)
[07:49:46] <shoky> yer welcome
[08:01:32] <EdwardIII> hrm, if jQuery ui or some plugin starts moving DOM elements around, as long as they're in the same container .delegate should still work right? that's kind of the point, isn't it?
[08:01:39] <EdwardIII> (working on some legacy code)
[08:04:13] <shoky> EdwardIII: yeah.. if the elements still match the selector
[08:04:34] <shankstaBytes> if I have alot of html that I am returning from an ajax call how can i transfer it the best way?
[08:04:44] <shankstaBytes> i get errors
[08:05:38] <EdwardIII> just got an odd problem where a change event is triggering fine in all sane web browsers, but failing in IE
[08:06:15] <dabear> EdwardIII: fiddle it!
[08:06:24] <shoky> EdwardIII: when pressing enter?
[08:06:44] <EdwardIII> shoky: it's on a selectbox, but the selectbox is getting messed around with by one of these jquery plugins to make a sexy dropdown from a normal selectbox
[08:07:03] <EdwardIII> also for added tastyness it's all on legacy code
[08:07:06] <shoky> oh, no idea
[08:07:52] <EdwardIII> well, in a way it's kinda not relevant because changing the widget manipulates the underlying hidden <select>
[08:08:04] <EdwardIII> and that registers as a change event on chrome just fine and dandy
[08:08:17] * EdwardIII attempts to make a mockup
[08:09:23] <shankstaBytes> anyone have an idea
[08:09:26] <shankstaBytes> ?
[08:10:17] <c4ptnh00k> shankstabytes: go over what evactly you have
[08:10:24] <c4ptnh00k> exactly
[08:10:57] <bakers> Is there a way to launch directly to the Firebug console?
[08:11:07] <bakers> Right now I hit F12 then have to click over to it
[08:11:53] <hXm> hello hi
[08:12:34] <hXm> im already lost, i have this http://conoced.me/prueba.xhtml and the "Profile header" line is not editable, but i have added the contenteditable tag, and i think is jquery javascript
[08:13:00] <Kingsy> if I hvae a function as so --> http://pastie.org/7939383 <-- couple of questions, first, how do you pass into the two handler functions the current element so it can be referenced by the timeout?
[08:13:16] <Kingsy> just adding a perameter to the function and passing "this" doesnt seem to work
[08:15:18] <andrew9184> it shoudl work
[08:15:57] <Kingsy> hmm just playing with hover() as a function now
[08:16:25] <dabear> Kingsy: inside both handlerIn and handlerOut, this refers to the current jquery object. inside the settimeout, you would have to use a closure to access "this"
[08:16:31] <Kingsy> ahhh i got it
[08:16:46] <dabear> or use the let-keyword which isn't available in most browsers:p
[08:17:18] <Kingsy> dabear: how about this as a solution --> http://pastie.org/7939399
[08:17:42] <Assim_Build> what part of the portlets demo is it that makes the sortable not use li objects? I'm having a hard time duplicating: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/16/
[08:17:58] <Assim_Build> (drag and, or or not into the visible and box)
[08:18:50] <Cork> Assim_Build: not sure if that is an answer but sortable as an option for the selector that defines what it is it sorts
[08:19:25] <dabear> Kingsy: should work, but not optimal, as you can't reuse the handlerIn and handlerOut functions later without regressions (e.g. el would point to the wrong element )
[08:20:53] <Assim_Build> Cork: not sure I understand what your mean. PS to all the demo I"m referring to is: http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#portlets
[08:21:17] <Kingsy> dabear: hrm I see, another thing, that code, why is it in () ?
[08:21:22] <Kingsy> the entire statement
[08:21:27] <EdwardIII> ah, found this tasty little number: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/f1abd90f076a11fd4ae2
[08:21:39] <EdwardIII> so i guess that fireEvent isn't actually firing an event in IE
[08:21:49] <dabear> Kingsy: it's a one off function, basically to not pollute the global namespace
[08:22:19] <Kingsy> dabear: a one off function?
[08:22:49] <brainwarped> The dpasted code captures double clicks on rows that were added prior to loading the page, but does not capture double clicks on rows that were loaded via ajax, unless the page is refreshed. How can I fix this so that the user can double click on rows that were added via ajax? http://dpaste.org/9VGEg/
[08:22:56] <dabear> Kingsy: I guess a more correct term is Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
[08:23:26] <EdwardIII> why would someone use jQuery then write all this stuff without it? the mind boggles
[08:23:27] <Assim_Build> oh i see the problem
[08:23:32] <EdwardIII> here's that fireEvent function: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/f1abd90f076a11fd4ae2#file-cluster-js-L45
[08:23:41] <Assim_Build> it's not a sortable setting it's just not grabbing the helper, and so inserting the li
[08:23:42] <EdwardIII> could i register for that with event delegation do you think?
[08:24:53] <EdwardIII> it's not producing any errors in IE, it's just not firing
[08:29:33] <Assim_Build> hey shoky you still there by chance? or c4ptnh00k? I need feedback: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/18/ it appears the receive method only fires after an object has been received (maybe I'm wrong) but could I somehow validate what's being received and return a value to say 'this object is invalid, revert it'?
[08:37:26] <dabear> Kingsy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9485270/javascript-settimeout-closure-issue - the MakeTimeoutCall is the correct way to do it
[08:38:13] <ddr-2kpp> hi there,
[08:38:13] <ddr-2kpp> i got a problem with handling events:
[08:38:13] <ddr-2kpp> on a <select> box i'm watching for change events, correct the users choice, if needed, but afterthat, the click event reverses my selections...
[08:38:30] <ddr-2kpp> is there a way to stop the click event, when i need it?
[08:41:45] <c4ptnh00k> Assim_Build: your stuff here is pretty jacked up lol
[08:41:53] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: ikr? lol
[08:42:03] <Assim_Build> it's what happens from a shift in paradigm i guess, lol
[08:42:20] <Rajni> hey guys, does anyone work with jquery-ui datepicker localization?
[08:42:52] <dabear> ddr-2kpp: .click(function(ev){ if(shouldPreventDefault){ev.preventDefault();}  })
[08:43:19] <dabear> ddr-2kpp: where shouldPreventDefault is either a variable or an expression to figure out if the click should be prevented
[08:43:58] <ddr-2kpp> dabear: going 2 chk...
[08:44:34] <dabear> ofc if you just copy&paste that without adopting it to fit your needs, it wouldn't work :)
[08:45:09] <dabear> bot-t: you're back!1
[08:45:09] <bot-t> dabear, Yes.
[08:48:18] <Assim_Build> why is ui.helper null? bug in jquery?
[08:48:28] <Assim_Build> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/19/
[08:53:09] <ddr-2kpp> dabear: 4sure, but i thought there is a way without playing with local variables...
[08:55:01] <t243ks> Is it possible to ask a question about javascript here?
[08:57:18] <eph3meral> t243ks: yes of course, although you'll probably get better results in ##javascript if it's really a pure JS related question
[08:58:41] <Bloomberg> Someone know how can I put info inside a textarea by default?
[08:59:11] <c4ptnh00k> Assim_Build: Think I got it for you
[08:59:21] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: really? that would be awesome!
[08:59:36] <c4ptnh00k> but first
[08:59:49] <c4ptnh00k> what is the acceptance criteria?
[08:59:50] <eph3meral> Bloomberg: $('textarea.myTextArea').text("Stuff I want to go inside my text area")
[09:00:01] <NoiseEee> textarea's have values.
[09:00:04] <Assim_Build> well it will be different from box type to box type
[09:00:06] <shoky> Assim_Build: you want ui.item i think
[09:00:08] <NoiseEee> s/'//
[09:00:15] <Assim_Build> for instance, a not box can only contain one child
[09:00:22] <c4ptnh00k> just drag into box and be able to sort?
[09:00:27] <t243ks> OK, on a GSP page, I have: <g:set scope="application" var="zzzz" value="EN"/> and in my 		window.onload = function (){${application.zzzz}="asdfadf";	alert("${application.zzzz}");}; shows a messagebox with "EN".  Any suggestions why?
[09:00:35] <Assim_Build> shoky: item is the li, not the div I generate to show the helper, iirc
[09:00:45] <Bloomberg> eph3meral: Ok
[09:00:46] <Bloomberg> thanks
[09:01:14] <happyfac1> I found this interesting (selector comparison) http://jsperf.com/aaaaaaasdasddddww
[09:01:17] <eph3meral> t243ks: hmm, what is GSP?
[09:01:22] <eph3meral> google or something?
[09:01:29] <eph3meral> <g: seems to be an SVG related thing no?
[09:01:30] <Assim_Build> then i'm hopefully going to add if they user is holding down control when they drag it makes a copy otherwise just moves
[09:01:36] <Assim_Build> i don't know if I'll get that far today
[09:01:45] <dabear> ddr-2kpp: that's why I said "or an expression..", ie you could use .data to store your state
[09:02:20] <Assim_Build> and really "NOT" is the only one I can think of that has a criteria
[09:02:46] <c4ptnh00k> you logic in your sortable method is jacking everything up. using simply $('.boxcontent').sortable(); works
[09:02:59] <ddr-2kpp> dabear: something like event.stopPropagation() with specifying which event to stop is not possible?
[09:03:00] <brainwarped> I have a document.ready issue with regards to using "this"... After an ajax table injection, "this" doesn
[09:03:07] <brainwarped> t recognize the new rows...
[09:03:12] <Assim_Build> really? /me tests
[09:03:55] <t243ks> groovy server page.
[09:04:04] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: see, it's adding the li item, not the div helper
[09:04:17] <shoky> Assim_Build: hmm.. http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-connectToSortable     Note: The helper option must be set to "clone" in order to work flawlessly.
[09:04:17] <Assim_Build> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/25/
[09:04:25] <dabear> ddr-2kpp: u woul have to add an event listener for all events if you wanna do that
[09:04:43] <Assim_Build> shoky: well dag nab it! :P
[09:04:43] <c4ptnh00k> so you want boxes in boxes again but sortable boxes?
[09:04:51] <shoky> ;p
[09:04:55] <ddr-2kpp> dabear: i.c. ...
[09:05:00] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: yes, I want ultimately the option to move filters from box to box
[09:05:01] <Bloomberg_> How can I check a checkbox about the received integer data from 1 to 7 from data base
[09:05:05] <Assim_Build> or one box to another box
[09:05:14] <Assim_Build> (trying to make this as fluid as possible)
[09:05:20] <ddr-2kpp> dabear: ok, && thx 4 any aid...
[09:06:01] <c4ptnh00k> ahh i see thought you said you changed gears. I must have miss understood
[09:06:37] <Assim_Build> well, in some ways I did, i thought using a sortable might be the best way of making it more fluid, and swtiching from draggable to sortable is a decent chunk of change
[09:06:51] <dabear> ddr-2kpp: if you want to add ONE event listener for a certain event specified in a variable, though, you could do it like this: var ev = "click"; $("foo")[ev] = function(){ ...}
[09:07:01] <dabear> not sure what you wanna do, really
[09:07:16] <Rajni> hi guys.. does anyone know why i keep getting this error: TypeError: a.datepicker is undefined after this: <script src="http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest/ui/minified/i18n/jquery.ui.datepicker-pt-BR.min.js"></script>
[09:07:19] <c4ptnh00k> but sortable shares many of the characteristics of draggable
[09:07:33] * Assim_Build nods
[09:07:47] <Assim_Build> it does not however share the event "drop"
[09:08:05] <Assim_Build> that would be an opportune event to enter validation for the control
[09:08:05] <dabear> ddr-2kpp: $("foo")[ev](function(){... }) is the way to do it
[09:08:15] <Assim_Build> if it's not already present
[09:08:17] <Bloomberg_> For example I'm getting a integer record from data base, this number is " 4 ". So I show a checkbox input for each one week day, and the received number should to be checked. in this case " saturday "
[09:08:34] <c4ptnh00k> but you could always use mouse events for that too
[09:08:52] <Assim_Build> in which case? a sortable or draggable?
[09:09:22] <Assim_Build> shoky: would you reccomend trying to hash out a sortable or work with draggables and hash out the fluid nature I'm after?
[09:09:37] <ddr-2kpp> dabear: won't help, i just need to cancel the click event, when i processed the change event, and had to correct the users input. else the events should processed as always...
[09:09:59] <c4ptnh00k> if its on drop you can memic that event trigger as when i release the mouse button
[09:10:21] <dabear> ddr-2kpp: seems like the wrong way to do it. if you create a jsfiddle, we might show you a better way..
[09:10:59] <didiergm> in jquerymobile what is the recommended way to enhance a generated page (including header+navbar and footer)
[09:11:05] <Rajni> solved
[09:11:37] <dabear> Bloomberg_: create multiple checkboxes with names name="days[1]" name="days[2]"  etc
[09:11:53] <Assim_Build> do you know if that will wait for my mouse release method to finish before triggering the insertion of the new object into the sortable or should I check that?
[09:12:19] <c4ptnh00k> it would not wait
[09:12:29] <Assim_Build> that's what I would think
[09:13:17] <Bloomberg_> dabear: But what I would have with this?
[09:13:27] <dabear> Bloomberg_: sorry?
[09:13:29] <dabear> this?
[09:13:32] <dabear> huh??
[09:14:06] <dabear> you should try to better explain what you wanna do
[09:15:11] <mrgnrdrck> I think I might have found a bug in jQuery 1.9.x. Before I go and file a bug report, could someone else have a quick peek at my testcase with a WebKit based browser and see if it also looks like a bug to them? http://roderick.dk/experiments/jquery-checkbox/
[09:15:19] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: what do you think? would it be easier to work this out with a sortable vs. droppable?
[09:16:33] <c4ptnh00k> Assim_Build: The only way I see this happening is with conditional logic. ie if(parentBox.textvalue == "NOT"){if(child.count !>0){add me}}
[09:17:16] <freannrak> i've got an element with an on click event listener attached to it. My script works fine, but when I duplicate the row (element included) dynamically I don't get the on.('click'.. listener on the other row. Any ideas?
[09:17:28] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: ya there would be a statement like that in there somewhere, but can we have that kind of validation with a sortable or should I just stick with droppable?
[09:18:28] <c4ptnh00k> Assim_Build: you can have that level of validation in either case, but ultimatelty droppable will be easier.
[09:18:45] <ddr-2kpp> dabear: maybe later, got 2 find out how jsfiddle.net works... maybe when i'm back @home
[09:18:53] <brainwarped> freannrak: sounds like I have a similar problem right now... I'm thinking it has somethign to do with the dynamic content loading after the document is ready, but I don't know the solution.
[09:18:58] <ddr-2kpp> dabear: nevertheless, thx alot!
[09:19:21] <dabear> ddr-2kpp: maybe this is what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/5YqGs/
[09:19:31] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: where would that kind of validation come into play in the case of a selectable? that's what I'm not seeing. I'm getting the sense though that it would be easier to hash out the insertion appearance a sortable provides in a set of droppables
[09:19:45] <freannrak> brainwarped: I think the correct way to do it would be to make a plugin and attach it to the element when it's dynamically created...
[09:19:56] <freannrak> brainwarped: but I'm really just looking for a quick fix for now.
[09:21:28] <dapingwing> hi can anyone help me ? : in jquery mobile i dynamicly append the options of a select and now i want to get the value when the user presses a button
[09:21:49] <Assim_Build> freannrak: are you using clone() to duplicate? if so it accepts a boolean parameter of whether or not to duplicate data and events as well
[09:21:50] <brainwarped> freannrak: me too. so we need to copy the listener code into the success hook?\
[09:22:06] <NCS_One> hi
[09:22:32] <c4ptnh00k> Assim_Build: sortable will look cleaner, droppable will function better with validation.
[09:22:48] <NCS_One> on "$.ajax" is there a way to get the element cliked?
[09:22:52] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: what a sucky trade-off lol
[09:23:25] <c4ptnh00k> Assim_Build: word. You can use css to make up for some of it though
[09:24:02] <Assim_Build> c4ptnh00k: with enough work I could make a set of droppables look exactly like a sortable, I'm sure. the key word is 'enough'
[09:24:03] <Assim_Build> :P
[09:24:10] <MindSpark> hi, will someone tell me why this code is not executing
[09:24:37] <Assim_Build> MindSpark: what code?
[09:24:40] <freannrak> Assim_Build: yeah, I'm using clone and I had it set to false. It's working now, but it broke a few other things (the original reason I had it disabled).
[09:24:47] <MindSpark> http://pastebin.com/sTQd2MjC
[09:25:03] <freannrak> brainwarped: clone(true) might work for you
[09:25:15] <freannrak> Assim_Build: thanks
[09:26:27] <brainwarped> freannrak: i'm looking into it, thanks!
[09:27:39] <Assim_Build> MindSpark: it's hard to tell without the html it's working on (jsfiddle.net), what exactly isn't working? my only suggestion with this info would be to change line 3 to .prop('checked', false)
[09:28:11] <Assim_Build> freannrak: np :)
[09:28:46] <MindSpark> Assim_Build: yes, I tried both, attr/removeAttr and prop. I am just not sure if that's the right syntax to switch clicked buttons
[09:30:05] <Assim_Build> MindSpark: using .prop is the correct way to toggle the checked state of radios and checkboxes as of, iirc, jquery 1.8
[09:30:38] <MindSpark> Assim_Build: alright, thanks, I guess, I'll have to play around a bit more and see where the problem is
[09:30:56] <Assim_Build> MindSpark: if you can draft a quick jsfiddle I can look more at your specific problem
[09:32:38] <dapingwing> Can anyone help me on getting the value of a dropdownbox on jquerymobile where the options are dynamically added
[09:32:41] <MindSpark> Assim_Build: I think I may have figured it out
[09:32:48] <MindSpark> I am using jqueryui buttonset
[09:32:57] <MindSpark> and I think I may have forgotten to call refresh on it
[09:33:00] <MindSpark> after I change

[09:35:36] <dapingwing> c4ptnh00k : doesn't work
[09:36:01] <brainwarped> freannrak: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ may be the answer... or live()
[09:36:18] <c4ptnh00k> dapingwing: what do you mean it doesn't work i have nothing to look at to see what you are doing
[09:37:25] <c4ptnh00k> you should be able to use $('select.foo option:selected').val();
[09:37:48] <dapingwing> here's my full script
[09:37:48] <dapingwing> http://pastebin.com/7VTeNfSL
[09:37:59] <dapingwing> i've tried every type of $()
[09:38:12] <dapingwing> and workarounds
[09:38:56] <quietschie> can anyone tell me if there is a difference between js Arrays and jQuery Objects that hold many elements?
[09:46:41] <c4ptnh00k> dapingwing: $('option:selected").val(); should be changed to $('#selector-schools option:selected).val(); I think
[09:47:19] <c4ptnh00k> you are not actually selecting a select to grab the selected option from
[09:47:23] <dapingwing> c4ptnh00k : tried it , doesn't work
[09:47:41] <c4ptnh00k> well you should still change it because that is wrong
[09:50:13] <c4ptnh00k> what does your console.log($('#selector-schools option:selected).val();) say
[09:50:29] <Cork> you can't use val on an option
[09:51:02] <c4ptnh00k> cork: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a1/experiments/api-viewer/docs/val/
[09:51:44] <Cork> that makes no sense
[09:52:11] <Cork> option holds no state so you would just get the pre selected option
[09:52:15] <Cork> and the value from it
[09:52:39] <c4ptnh00k> but it has a selected prop no?
[09:52:43] <Cork> <option selected="selected"></option>
[09:52:44] <dapingwing> i assigned a value to the option
[09:52:55] <Cork> no you would get the static value from the option
[09:53:11] <Cork> unless :selected actually checks the parent select element...
[09:53:18] <Cork> haven't actually checked that
[09:53:39] <c4ptnh00k> thats what I was reading
[09:53:42] <clov3r> shouldn't $('#selector-schools option:selected).val() actually be $('#selector-schools).val()
[09:54:13] <Cork> ugg it does >_<
[09:54:34] <c4ptnh00k> clov3r: both work
[09:54:47] <Cork> clov3r: yes, and that is the selector that makes sense
[09:54:58] <clov3r> ;)
[09:55:04] <Cork> :selected is artificially making the option selection work
[09:55:44] <c4ptnh00k> so like i said  $('#selector-schools option:selected').val()
[09:55:45] <Cork> i could understand its use for $('#selector-schools option:selected).text()
[09:55:49] <Assim_Build> clover beat me to it: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/mJSkt/
[09:55:53] <Cork> but it is totally pointless for .val()
[09:57:28] <dapingwing> i get this : 05-21 23:57:15.005: I/Web Console(15850): [CDebug]Test var! :undefined:141
[09:57:42] <dapingwing> for

[09:57:43] <dapingwing> 		test = $('#selector-schools option:selected').val();
[09:57:43] <dapingwing> 		console.log('[CDebug]Test var! :'+test);
[09:57:43] <dapingwing> 	}
[09:57:57] <clov3r> cork: except that it makes sense...
[09:58:33] <Cork> clov3r: that depends if you look at it from the point of the dom or the point of html
[09:58:45] <Cork> from th point of the dom it makes no sense at all
[09:58:50] <c4ptnh00k> dapingwing: if you did not assign a value to the option and you are looking for the text use .text()
[09:59:05] <c4ptnh00k> if you assigned a value then .val() will work
[09:59:05] <Speedstick> is there any major advantages of jquery over writing regular javascript for typical websites or mobile focused sites?
[09:59:11] <dapingwing> i did assign values
[09:59:21] <Cork> Speedstick: readability
[09:59:24] <NoiseEee> Speedstick: yes, speed of deployment
[09:59:24] <clov3r> cork: but looking at it from the point of view as a user... .val() returns the value that I would be looking for
[09:59:28] <BillCriswell> Speedstick: Compatability.
[09:59:37] <dapingwing> Speedstick : speed of coding and les chance on making mistakes
[09:59:38] <Cork> Speedstick: but you will pay a small price in load time and speed
[09:59:40] <Assim_Build> Speedstick: increased functionality for less code
[10:00:01] <Cork> the compatibility is less of an argument if you don't code for ie<9
[10:00:09] <dapingwing> who uses IE these days
[10:00:17] <Assim_Build> dapingwing: customers :P
[10:00:24] <dapingwing> true
[10:00:24] <BillCriswell> Speedstick: Load it off Google's CDN, chances are it's already cached. ( Always provide a backup )
[10:00:38] <c4ptnh00k> unfortunately too many ppl still use ie<9
[10:00:41] <clov3r> dapingwing: ~30% of the internet base?
[10:00:43] <dapingwing> c4ptnh00k : does this count as giving a value $('#Select_school #selector-schools').append('<option  value="'+schooldetail[2]+'">'+schooldetail[1]+'</option>');
[10:00:45] <BillCriswell> Er, fallback
[10:01:00] <kedarm> To ensure that an element is always visible, I am implementing a strategy: $(this).show(); $(this).parents("div").show(); I believe it works as expected. What is a better way?
[10:01:24] <BillCriswell> kedarm: Just don't hide it... unless I'm misunderstanding something haha
[10:01:26] <Speedstick> ie 8 and 7 are pretty common still
[10:01:40] <Cork> kedarm: $(this).parents().andSelf().show() ?
[10:01:46] <kedarm> BillCriswell: hiding may be a user action (collpasible element)
[10:01:47] <Cork> :)
[10:02:22] <BillCriswell> kedarm: If you want to make sure it's always visible why is it in a collapsable element?
[10:02:54] <dapingwing> found my mistake
[10:03:13] <shoky> Assim_Build:  i don't see a good way to do it with sortable ;S
[10:03:38] <kedarm> BillCriswell: It's an optionally visible element for otherwise form is too large. The user expands the element, collapses it, but makes a mistake that validating code catches. Now, validating code needs to focus that element when it shows an alert. Makes sense?
[10:03:43] <c4ptnh00k> dapingwing: want to share?
[10:04:00] <c4ptnh00k> was there value in your array?
[10:04:12] <BillCriswell> kedarm: Okie dokie.
[10:04:13] <kedarm> Cork: Checking andSelf() out. Thanks!
[10:04:20] <Assim_Build> shoky: always nice to have the expert affirming what I thought was the case :)
[10:04:24] <dapingwing> just a sec
[10:04:27] <dapingwing> testing something
[10:05:28] <c4ptnh00k> lol Im def no expert. I just try to contribute what I can.
[10:06:53] <c4ptnh00k> i will generally always defer to cork... except on selected option vals lol j/k
[10:07:56] <Cork> c4ptnh00k: i have some burnt in tracks from the fact that i've coded longer in pure js then in jquery
[10:08:20] <Cork> so when i want to do something on a page i start at trying to do it the way the dom expects it to be done
[10:08:32] <Cork> and jquery sometimes messes with me there
[10:09:02] <Cork> the least weird one that messes the most with me is actually something as simple as appendTo
[10:09:05] <c4ptnh00k> Cork: you still school me! I'm coming into web dev from embedded systems soooo. wee bit of a learning curve
[10:09:05] <freannrak> what would be the easiest way to get the formset ID out of a string? id_observation_fs-2-taxon_node_0 (i'm interested in the number 2 ID)
[10:09:09] <Speedstick> what was it i read that jquery was dropping old ie support or something?
[10:09:12] <Speedstick> why would they do
[10:09:34] <guideX> well ie10 finally renders most tags, why support older ie?
[10:09:40] <Cork> c4ptnh00k: i started hacking at jquery back when document.write was more or less all you had
[10:09:51] <Cork> css was a nogo, and events was scares
[10:09:54] <guideX> force people to upgrade I say..
[10:09:59] <c4ptnh00k> Cork: ... you old man!
[10:10:00] <Cork> uh...
[10:10:09] <Cork> sorry i meant i started hacking at javascript :P
[10:10:26] <c4ptnh00k> figured thats what you meant
[10:10:41] <shoky> js> var s = 'id_observation_fs-2-taxon_node_0'; print( s.split('-')[1] )
[10:10:43] <b-ot> shoky: 2
[10:10:47] <shoky> freannrak ^
[10:10:47] <Cork> and i'm actually comming from a c/c++ background
[10:11:03] <Cork> (mixed with asm and pascal)
[10:11:18] <freannrak> thanks shoky
[10:11:19] <Speedstick> x86 ASM rocks :)
[10:11:22] <Speedstick> masm <3
[10:11:37] <Cork> ya, 486 and 386 was fun
[10:11:41] <c4ptnh00k> kool I did embedded c(writting drivers) is ok, but not too many jobs left for me
[10:11:50] <Cork> the later registers started to get a bit too complex
[10:11:52] <Speedstick> random but just for the record the new blackberry 10 sdk one of their main languages is c/c++ now, they dropped java
[10:12:05] <Speedstick> that's directed @Cork :)
[10:12:06] <Cork> Speedstick: good for them :)
[10:12:15] <c4ptnh00k> java is soon to be dead so that doesn't surprise me
[10:12:42] <Cork> ya, oracle is really trying hard to make sure of that
[10:13:09] <Cork> suing companies using it, and claiming that exploits is by design...
[10:13:22] <c4ptnh00k> cough google cough android
[10:14:04] <freannrak> shoky: yay, it works. Even with ID 100. Thanks again :=).
[10:14:30] <dapingwing> c4ptnhook : it was a split() error on my side
[10:14:41] <dapingwing> defining my value as "undefined"
[10:15:31] <Cork> c4ptnh00k: security explorations still have a proof of concept for an exploit and oracle refuses to acknowledge
[10:15:40] <dapingwing> btw just to add, Exploiting anything pure oracle is easy , it's my job
[10:15:44] <Cork> they've been fighting with them for close to a year now
[10:16:31] <Cork> (ontop of the like 60 exploits the have reported and gotten fixed in the same amount of time)
[10:17:03] <c4ptnh00k> THis does not surprise me. It's cheaper to ignore it than fix it. And since their company is so pretentious they would naturally digress to the "We made it that way on purpose" argument
[10:17:08] <Cork> oh sorry its close to 70 now >_>
[10:17:16] <Cork> http://www.security-explorations.com/en/SE-2012-01-poc.html
[10:17:37] <dapingwing> i found 114 exploits on 1 oracle server recently its just sad
[10:17:45] <Cork> ya
[10:18:11] <Cork> and the predefined number of emergency fixes is just hilarious
[10:18:20] <dapingwing> i never took the time to learn java , but hearing this stuff about oracle just doesn't motivate me at all
[10:18:40] <Cork> "ya, we release emergency updates 4 times a year, at predefined dates 12 months ahead of time"
[10:19:07] <Cork> i learned java a bit back
[10:19:09] <c4ptnh00k> I learned java back in college and I have used it once since
[10:19:15] <Cork> wasn't hard as it shares a lot with c
[10:19:37] <Cork> i use it for some open source android apps i fiddle with
[10:19:40] <c4ptnh00k> i did like the oop idea but thought c# did it better
[10:19:42] <Cork> but never for desktops
[10:19:58] <c4ptnh00k> if only c# was open platform
[10:20:15] <Cork> looked at c# back when it cam never liked it
[10:20:30] <c4ptnh00k> bbiab lunch time
[10:20:42] <c4ptnh00k> c# has grown
[10:20:56] <Cork> ya...
[10:21:16] * Cork looks at the long list of installed packages just to support c# on a basic windows system...
[10:22:58] <cam`_> yea C# is great
[10:23:44] <kedarm> A wise man once told me to learn as many (programming) languages as I can and learn to speak them well ...
[10:24:26] <Cork> ya, my list of programming languages is starting to be silly...
[10:24:47] <Cork> on the other hand i start to forget a few of them cause it was too long since i used them
[10:24:57] <kedarm> But I realize that learning to think in that language takes time.
[10:24:59] <Cork> like pascal
[10:25:24] <Cork> kedarm: ya, and when you move to a new language you tend to mess up that flow
[10:25:28] <kedarm> Like Perlis once said (to have said): There is no point in learning a language unless it changes the way you think ...
[10:26:35] <kedarm> Cork: And the thing becomes messier as you become a web programmer because you constantly move back and forth (unless you use Node, of course ;))
[10:26:50] <Cork> kedarm: no kidding
[10:27:18] <Cork> go, ruby, rails, html, javascript, jquery, python, perl, php...
[10:27:38] <Cork> they arn't really having the same syntax to express it lightly :)
[10:27:43] <shoky> i did some perl yesterday and must've written 'var' instead of 'my' at least 15 times ;S
[10:28:19] <Cork> array, hash, objects syntax is what i normally have the most problem with
[10:28:46] <Cork> is it key:val or 'key' => val or :key => val or... >_<
[10:29:53] <kedarm> Syntax is one thing that tools help with, but there is much deeper problem which has to do with semantics.
[10:30:09] <Cork> true
[10:30:18] <Cork> and not to forget coding standards
[10:30:43] <kedarm> agree!
[10:36:41] <Cork> if there is one language i have a hard time seeing the point of it has to be asp.net
[10:36:50] <dapingwing> i second that !
[10:36:51] <Cork> it just does not seam to scale at all
[10:37:36] <dapingwing> why use it ? php is way more efficient :D
[10:38:08] <Cork> funny enough ya, even though asp.net precompiles the files php still runs circles around it
[10:39:10] <Cork> on the other hand, old php has to be one of the most horrible languages
[10:39:25] <Cork> with possible exception of htaccess :)
[10:44:45] <dapingwing> does that even count as a language?
[10:45:00] <s5fs> nah it's a config file
[10:46:14] <s5fs> worst language i worked in professionally was cobol, i spent several years working with it
[10:46:25] <Cork> well it is a file with a syntax
[10:46:58] <d0100> why would $(this).find('tr').hide() work, but $(this).find('tr').lenght wont?
[10:47:06] <Cork> s5fs: heh i've heard stories about cobol :)
[10:47:22] <Cork> cause its .length ?
[10:47:37] <dapingwing> what he said ^
[10:47:50] <Cork> .lenght <--
[10:47:51] <d0100> hahaha, damn.. failhard
[10:47:55] <s5fs> Cork: they're likely true, but i don't hate the language or anything. i dislike powershell more, oddly enough.
[10:48:29] <Assim_Build> shoky: c4ptnh00k: one of you still there? I'm getting some buggy looking validation going on here, not sure what the better approache is http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/28/
[10:48:29] <Cork> s5fs: hmm can't make up my mind about powershell
[10:48:40] <dapingwing> i've only had one hatefull programming language experience and thats ti-Basic cause you are so limited ! i had to build a full framework first
[10:49:10] <Cork> s5fs: like all microsofts produces it is overcompensated and slow; but it is actually a step in the right direction
[10:49:13] <s5fs> Cork: i spent too much time with vbscript and while it sucked, i was still more effective with it than ps. i think that's mostly just experience more than anything else, i haven't had to immerse myself in ps.
[10:49:23] <Assim_Build> dapingwing: well, it's for calculators not supercomputers :P
[10:49:34] <Cork> s5fs: ugg never ever liked vbscript
[10:49:42] <s5fs> Cork: same
[10:49:44] <Cork> i can live with vba, but...
[10:49:50] <Cork> never vbscript
[10:50:01] <dapingwing> Assim_Build : i was able to build pokemon in it so i would beg to differ
[10:50:27] <dapingwing> its just horribily documented
[10:50:34] <s5fs> Cork: I used vbs mainly for adsi, it was so easy to dork with active directory
[10:50:39] <dapingwing> never tried powershell , what would you use it for ?
[10:50:49] <Assim_Build> dapingwing: no question you can do a lot just wasn't made to be a high-power developer environment :P
[10:50:52] <s5fs> dapingwing: automation in a windows environment
[10:51:01] <SeanJM> anyone here have experience with downloading and installing the Windows 7 IE 8 VMC?
[10:51:11] <s5fs> dapingwing: case in point, i wanna create a bunch of users with email accts from a csv file. use powershell
[10:51:15] <dapingwing> Assim_Build : true
[10:51:24] <Cork> not just automation
[10:51:35] <dapingwing> s5fs : good to know , prefer linux but might need powershell someday
[10:51:46] <Cork> it is basically a command line interface where you can control all of microsofts environments
[10:51:56] <s5fs> dapingwing: same, i too prefer linux
[10:51:59] <Cork> including the domain controller, exchange iis, sharepoint and so on
[10:52:19] <Cork> s5fs: same here
[10:52:50] <s5fs> Cork: true, you can manage some microsoft software via powershell cmdlets. in fact, with products such as exchange, some features are only available from powershell, they do not exist in the gui tools.
[10:53:11] <dapingwing> what i love about linux is the ability to load a script in any language with the shell , like php or javascript or sh or any..
[10:53:12] <Cork> s5fs: ya, i know
[10:53:49] <Cork> dapingwing: what i like the most with linux/unix is what i had the most problem with at the beginning
[10:53:53] <Cork> everything is a file
[10:54:07] <s5fs> i like streams the best, that's my fav part of unix
[10:54:08] <Cork> you can literary cat ANYTHING
[10:54:14] <dapingwing> true
[10:54:46] <Cork> s5fs: but unix isn't alone of having it
[10:54:58] <s5fs> Cork: sure, but streams are what enable pipefitting
[10:55:04] <Cork> to the extent it has is a different matter
[10:55:31] <dapingwing> Cork : what i miss in windows is WGET , if i had that in windows i would be able to port alot of my programs to windows
[10:55:35] <s5fs> without streams if you wanted to cat a file and pipe it to grep, you'd have to first read the entire file into memory and then hand it to grep.
[10:55:38] <Cork> s5fs: ya, but i meant even old dos could do streams, just very much limited compared to unix
[10:55:59] <Cork> dapingwing: uh... ever heard of gnu tools?
[10:56:09] <Cork> ?g gnu tools windows
[10:56:10] <b-ot> Cork: GnuWin32 â†’ http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
[10:56:10] <bot-t> Cork, GnuWin32 - http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
[10:56:15] <dapingwing> Cork : without requiring the user to install something
[10:56:34] <Cork> dapingwing: well that is the windows way
[10:57:12] <dapingwing> Cork: thanks might be intresting to look in to :D
[10:57:23] <Cork> dapingwing: i've actually seen scripts use telnet for network :)
[10:58:09] <dapingwing> Cork: well it's for a Minecraft / SRCDS server controller , wget allows me to download the app :)
[10:58:31] <Cork> well you do have the ftp command
[10:59:10] <dapingwing> hmm never tought of it that way
[11:00:27] <Cork> dapingwing: heh... and there is actually busybox for windows :)
[11:00:51] <Cork> (looked for it right now, forgot it existed)
[11:01:00] <Cork> ?g busybox windows
[11:01:00] <b-ot> Cork: The little gem that is BusyBox (for Windows) - Ashwin Jayaprakash's ... â†’ http://javaforu.blogspot.com/2011/04/little-gem-that-is-busybox-for-windows.html
[11:01:01] <bot-t> Cork, The little gem that is BusyBox (for Windows) - Ashwin Jayaprakash's ... - http://javaforu.blogspot.com/2011/04/little-gem-that-is-busybox-for-windows.html
[11:01:42] <Cork> and that is like a small linux all in a 600kb exe file :D
[11:01:53] <newtothis> say, can i do somehow something like moo = {'a':2, 'b':3, 'c':moo('a') + moo('b')}; ? can i reference 'a' and 'b' keys of moo within it's definition?
[11:02:30] <dapingwing> newtothis : yeah with moo[a]
[11:02:35] <Cork> you would have to do a + b separately
[11:02:49] <Cork> if you do it in the initial declaration a and b doesn't exist yet
[11:02:52] <newtothis> dapingwing, oh wrong parentheses :D thanks
[11:02:53] <dapingwing> true
[11:03:13] <dapingwing> need to be declared in advance
[11:03:30] <newtothis> Cork, oh i, see... :/
[11:03:43] <Cork> simplest is normally to just store a and b in separate variables and do { a:a, b:b, c:a+b }
[11:03:59] <dapingwing> moo = { 'a':2, 'b':3}
[11:04:17] <dapingwing> and then moo = {'c':moo['a'] + moo['b']}
[11:04:45] <dapingwing> or use moo['a']=2 , moo['b']=3 ...
[11:04:49] <Cork> or var a=2, b=3; var moo = { a:a, b:b, c:a+b };
[11:05:02] <dapingwing> same
[11:05:15] <Cork> i find the later a bit cleaner for some reason
[11:05:42] <newtothis> I see, thanks guys!
[11:06:16] <Cork> hmm...
[11:06:55] <Cork> wonder if $.extend(moo={a:2, b:3}, { c:moo.a + moo.b }); would work...
[11:06:56] <dapingwing> each has his prefered choice :)
[11:07:02] <dapingwing> try a fiddle
[11:07:12] <Cork> ?eval $.extend(moo={a:2, b:3}, { c:moo.a + moo.b })
[11:07:15] <bot-t> Cork: {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 5}
[11:07:19] <Cork> AH!
[11:07:21] <Cork> HA!
[11:07:52] <Cork> ?eval $.extend(moo={a:2, b:3}, { c:moo.a + moo.b }); moo.c
[11:07:53] <bot-t> Cork: 5
[11:07:55] <Cork> :D
[11:08:11] <Cork> poor guy to read that code later ^^'
[11:08:24] <Entomo> document it.
[11:08:25] <Entomo> well.
[11:08:31] <Entomo> that guy may be you
[11:08:37] <Cork> XD
[11:09:06] <Cork> opps
[11:09:13] <Cork> and... moo is actually global :s
[11:09:36] <Cork> not as fun anymore :)
[11:09:50] <dapingwing> why not just bash in his skull cork , the poor guy must be losing track
[11:11:05] <Cork> my fav to give ppl is
[11:11:18] <Cork> ?eval var a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]; a.length = 0; a
[11:11:19] <bot-t> Cork: []
[11:11:21] <Cork> :)
[11:11:38] <Cork> that messes with everyone that doens't know javascript well
[11:11:54] <Cork> ?eval var a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]; a.length = 2; a
[11:11:55] <bot-t> Cork: [1, 2]

[11:15:45] <iLogic> you guys know if it's possible to drag a div that is beneath other one (has lower z-index) using javascript?
[11:15:55] <Bloomberg_> http://jsbin.com/eyodub/1/edit
[11:16:11] <Cork> dapingwing: have you seen the undefined play thingy in ##javascript? :D
[11:16:28] <dapingwing> Cork : Not yet , enlighten me ?
[11:16:39] <dapingwing> Bloomberg_ : let me see whats your issue
[11:16:41] <Cork> one sec would have to dig in my logs
[11:16:58] <GaryOak_> ?eval var x = 'butts'; x
[11:16:58] <bot-t> GaryOak_: "butts"
[11:17:02] <dapingwing> hahha Cork it's the same thing i came with a few min ago
[11:17:16] <Bloomberg_> The idea is that if the value of the checkbox is equal at $numdia, the checkbox is checked
[11:17:26] <dapingwing> let me try it
[11:18:24] <dapingwing> is this function called upon
[11:18:30] <dapingwing> or should it be running 24/7
[11:18:49] <Bloomberg_> There are the week days, so there are seven checkboxes, if the var is equal at  " 4 " the selected checkbox should to be "saturday"
[11:19:03] <afrance> I kind of want to do this: http://jqueryui.com/button/#radio but setting images like it says to here: http://jqueryui.com/button/#icons seems like a fairly big pain in the ass, any plugins that would let me set the icon value in something like data-icon="image.jpg"?

[11:27:32] <dapingwing> Bloomberg_ : http://jsfiddle.net/9gf7B/ => what you wanted to achieve?
[11:28:20] <Cork> https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
[11:28:28] <Cork> opps
[11:29:53] <dapingwing> any other unanwserd questions ? :P
[11:31:10] <newtothis> say, do you guys understand how the visitor pattern works?
[11:31:20] <dapingwing> for what ?
[11:31:23] <BillCriswell> newtothis: They come to my site and spend no money then leave.
[11:31:34] <newtothis> BC :)
[11:31:35] <Cork> heh
[11:31:53] <dapingwing> okayyyyy i'm confused atm
[11:31:57] <Cork> newtothis: are you talking about some analytics tool?
[11:32:11] <c4ptnh00k> back
[11:32:11] <newtothis> Cork, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern
[11:32:12] <dapingwing> Cork : i think
[11:32:32] <BillCriswell> Ah... Flow charts.
[11:32:39] <BillCriswell> I should learn how to read these at some point.
[11:32:48] <Cork> XD
[11:33:05] <dapingwing> hahhahaha just try to study logic systems
[11:33:08] <dapingwing> you will
[11:33:12] <Cork> the only programming book i have ever read actually said i should always start with writing one
[11:33:20] <Cork> i never have ^^'
[11:33:36] <newtothis> @_@
[11:33:39] <dapingwing> i have never read a programming book :D
[11:33:50] <dapingwing> way to much b******* and to little essence !
[11:34:02] <Cork> dapingwing: how did you get starting?
[11:34:02] <c4ptnh00k> <-- reading the .net book now :(
[11:34:05] <BillCriswell> I read a 10 minute guide to regular expressions book... definitely helped a lot.
[11:34:10] <Cork> *started
[11:34:29] <BillCriswell> I'm always afraid a book is going to be outdated so I'm very careful about buying technology related ones.
[11:34:30] <dapingwing> well easy , i learn objective oriented !
[11:34:51] <Cork> BillCriswell: books is normally outdated by the time you can buy it
[11:34:57] <Cork> more or less by definition
[11:35:05] <dapingwing> i wanted to make gamingservers so i just looked up how to and then looked up in detail and stuff that was at my 10 years
[11:35:17] <newtothis> nah, even today sicp, is relevant :)
[11:35:18] <BillCriswell> Cork: Regular Expressions have been the same for quite a bit now.. and the basics I pray to Jebus never change.
[11:35:26] <dapingwing> then i just looked what do i want to achieve and used W3schools or just common sense to learn it
[11:36:05] <`andy> im using $.post() to send data to a URL, which is suppose to return a pdf. But doesn't, any help?
[11:36:06] <Cork> BillCriswell: i find small nuances added quite frequently
[11:36:21] <`andy> im guessing it's because its returning a pdf, and not html/json/etc
[11:36:30] <Cork> `andy: ajax can't do file download
[11:36:43] <`andy> what are my alternatives then?
[11:36:51] <dapingwing> 'andy: open a link instead sending the parameters
[11:36:53] <Cork> well except if you actually store the file in a javascript variable and then trigger a file save dialog :s
[11:36:56] <guideX> the jquery ui select menu doesn't work well when displayed a second time from within a fancybox, the jquery select menu looks all unstyled and weird
[11:37:02] <c4ptnh00k> `andy: no can do
[11:37:16] <`andy> problem is, i have this form that i pull the params from
[11:37:23] <dapingwing> guideX: can you show your code?
[11:37:31] <Cork> `andy: create wither a dynamic form or a static one and trigger a submit on it
[11:37:39] <Cork> *either
[11:37:51] <guideX> hmm I could yes, it'll take me a while though
[11:38:06] <dapingwing> Cork: or use a link with parameters if you really want to use something ajaxy and no page change
[11:38:09] <guideX> I'm not really sure how, there's a lot of files to consider..
[11:38:10] <`andy> ah ic, change the form's action maybe
[11:38:15] <Cork> dapingwing: a link can't do post
[11:38:18] <`andy> thanks Cork
[11:38:27] <dapingwing> Cork: yeah but use GET ?
[11:38:27] <guideX> perhaps it would be helpful to see a portion of the code?
[11:38:35] <dapingwing> guideX: yeah
[11:38:35] <Cork> dapingwing: he used $.post
[11:38:54] <dapingwing> Cork: well yeah then your solution is best
[11:40:52] <dapingwing> guideX: show me the Fancybox+ui code ?
[11:41:08] <guideX> http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39409
[11:41:13] <guideX> and i'm pasting the fancybox code now...
[11:41:54] <Bloomberg_> dapingwing: Thank you..
[11:42:18] <dapingwing> Bloomberg_: you're welcome
[11:42:21] <guideX> here's the fancybox
[11:42:22] <guideX> http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39410
[11:43:08] <dapingwing> guideX: try putting  $("select").selectmenu(); in your ready function
[11:43:10] <guideX> the problem occurs on subsequent fancybox popups, the first popup is ok.. But i'm currently reloading the whole page on fancybox close to workaroujnd it
[11:43:34] <guideX> so if the user closes fancybox, and goes and loads another fancybox, the jquery ui selectmenu looks really weird, and never goes away
[11:43:49] <acidjazz> lol fancybox
[11:43:53] <acidjazz> sounds so perverted
[11:43:53] <dapingwing> weird like what ? got a screenshot , might be the fancybox css
[11:44:04] <guideX> let me make a screenshot
[11:44:10] <guideX> well it's like totally unstyled...
[11:44:20] <guideX> but broken and floating above everything
[11:44:28] <dapingwing> i bet it's the css
[11:44:28] <guideX> i'll make a screen
[11:45:33] <dapingwing> acidjazz: it's just one of the many lightbox alternatives and they do tend to have the wierdest names
[11:47:18] <druiz> Hello
[11:47:32] <dapingwing> hi
[11:49:14] <dapingwing> Cork: i must ask what kind of job do you have
[11:49:31] <Cork> developer
[11:49:35] <dapingwing> for?
[11:49:54] <Cork> automation + web + backend
[11:50:02] <Cork> a mixed deal
[11:50:07] <dapingwing> cool
[11:50:33] <Cork> so it ranges from html to c, go and so on
[11:50:54] <dapingwing> keeps it intresting ?
[11:51:00] <Cork> definitely
[11:51:11] <Cork> a day when i know what i'm doing is a day i'm not doing my job
[11:51:13] <Cork> :)
[11:51:36] <dapingwing> sounds like school
[11:51:40] <Cork> dapingwing: i'm working for a hosting company
[11:51:48] <Cork> it definitely is
[11:52:04] <Cork> i think i've learned more at this job then i did all through school
[11:52:06] <guideX> http://www.team-nexgen.org/bad.jpg
[11:52:08] <guideX> sorry for the delauy
[11:52:12] <dapingwing> no problem
[11:52:39] <dapingwing> this is a css issue i think
[11:52:43] <dapingwing> anything in console?
[11:52:44] <BillCriswell> Cork: I wish I was better with the server end of things.
[11:52:55] <guideX> nope no js errors
[11:53:02] <Cork> BillCriswell: here we don't do "ends" we do features
[11:53:11] <guideX> and if I move around the page, or close the popup, the weird hanging dropdowns are still there
[11:53:17] <guideX> but on first load, it looks good..
[11:53:24] <BillCriswell> Cork: What kind of features? Like... "one click" install type dealies?
[11:53:27] <dapingwing> are you running this anywhere so i can take a look?
[11:53:30] <Cork> so it ranges all from installing the backend, adding the server code to manage it, adding javascript + html + css to enable it
[11:53:37] <GaryOak_> Cork: What are you using Go for?
[11:53:56] <Cork> Garbee: we actually have a storage system written in it
[11:54:05] <guideX> hmm I don't have a public facing version.. I might be able to make it public facing..
[11:54:09] <Cork> and we have it on some of our backend systems
[11:54:27] <dapingwing> guideX: if you could i could make a fix for your problem
[11:54:40] <Cork> GaryOak_: opps wrong nick
[11:54:45] <BillCriswell> Id like to get good with Go, but I'm weird about putting all my focus into all google products.
[11:54:57] <dapingwing> got to ask What the hell is go?
[11:55:05] <Cork> ?g golang
[11:55:05] <b-ot> Cork: The Go Programming Language â†’ http://golang.org/
[11:55:06] <bot-t> Cork, The Go Programming Language - http://golang.org/
[11:55:10] <GaryOak_> Interesting, I've been wanting to learn it, I tried out some of the tutorials
[11:55:18] <guideX> ok cool thanks, i'll try tto get a facing version up
[11:55:50] <Cork> GaryOak_: it is an interesting language, that's for sure
[11:56:05] <Cork> and as far as i can tell it is the best backend to use for websocket
[11:56:21] <dapingwing> i have no idea what i'm looking at atm guys
[11:56:21] <lamarus> why would $('#mytag').data('loaded') return undefined but $.attr('data-loaded') return the string?
[11:56:26] <lamarus> sorry
[11:56:27] <BillCriswell> dapingwing: Haha
[11:56:32] <lamarus> why would $('#mytag').data('loaded') return undefined but $.attr('data-loaded') return the string?
[11:56:33] <BillCriswell> It's just another programming language.
[11:56:46] <dapingwing> lamarus no need to spam
[11:56:54] <oleyb> Cork: how is it better than node with socket.io?
[11:57:01] <dapingwing> and is .data even a function?
[11:57:03] <lamarus> why would $('#mytag').data('loaded') return undefined but $(#mytag').attr('data-loaded') return the string for <a data-loaded="true">...
[11:57:06] <lamarus> Was not trying to spam
[11:57:07] <oleyb> I don't see how it could get easier than that
[11:57:19] <lamarus> just kept hitting enter instead of shift
[11:57:22] <Cork> oleyb: it is a compiled language, or did you mean for websocket?
[11:57:25] <GaryOak_> oleyb: socket.io isn't perfect
[11:57:46] <oleyb> you had said its the best backend for websocket
[11:57:54] <oleyb> I was just curious what makes you say that
[11:58:03] <dapingwing> lamarus: i can't help you with this cause i actually never use .data()
[11:58:04] <Cork> the one with the best support cross the board
[11:58:19] <BillCriswell> lamarus: Can you show an example of this happening
[11:58:20] <Cork> it has normally the full support spec
[11:58:27] <oleyb> does it bring more to the table than node?
[11:58:34] <dapingwing> lamarus: and .attr('data-loaded') will give the value for data-loaded
[11:59:04] <Cork> oleyb: uh... it's like saying does c bring anything to the table that javascript doens't
[11:59:20] <Cork> oleyb: go is a compiled binary language
[11:59:24] <oleyb> I meant with respect to web sockets specifically
[11:59:28] <Cork> it means it is close to as fast as c
[11:59:34] <Cork> ah
[11:59:45] <oleyb> yeah, I've even used a bit of Go
[11:59:46] <BillCriswell> lamarus: http://jsbin.com/uzedir/1/edit worked here, must be something else going on.
[12:00:11] <oleyb> I was just curious if you felt that Go was better for web sockets than doing it in node, especially with socket.io
[12:00:14] <Cork> oleyb: i've had some problems getting socket.io to run as i want
[12:00:21] <oleyb> ah, so performance then
[12:00:23] <Cork> and go definitely has much less dependencies
[12:00:31] <Cork> (none to be exact)
[12:00:41] <Qbix1> hey guys
[12:00:47] <dapingwing> hey Qbix1
[12:00:50] <Qbix1> does jquery have some sort of callback I can register to know when it has been loaded?
[12:00:54] <oleyb> well, if I'm not mistaken, you can do websockets in node without needing any dependencies either
[12:00:56] <Qbix1> if I load jQuery asynchronously
[12:00:57] <dapingwing> yeah
[12:01:05] <oleyb> socket.io just makes it friendlier
[12:01:07] <Qbix1> after window.load
[12:01:18] <Qbix1> what's the clalback dapingwing?
[12:01:24] <dapingwing> sec
[12:01:36] <Cork> oleyb: except you need the entire javascript enterpreter + node.js + the rest of there big stack of dependencies
[12:01:45] <Qbix1> maybe there's some magic string it can call, I doubt it has it
[12:02:10] <Cork> oleyb: go has it built in and you can compile a server with websocket support with ~20 lines of code
[12:02:21] <dapingwing> Qbix1: add a function to the bottom of the jquery.js file
[12:02:23] <Cork> and the file can be copied to another server and it will just work
[12:02:26] <Cork> no installation needed
[12:02:31] <dapingwing> Qbix1: thats the easiest method
[12:02:37] <Cork> oleyb: try to do that with node.js :D
[12:02:43] <oleyb> Cork: Yeah, I guess it can just be easy to forget how much node abstracts things away for you
[12:03:33] <Qbix1> good point thanks dapingwing
[12:03:38] <Cork> oleyb: and if you for some reason run it on a server where one of the lib doesn't match the one needed for node.js you will see pain if you have never seen it before...
[12:04:01] <dapingwing> np Qbix1 here to help
[12:04:01] <oleyb> well, thats what npm -install is for
[12:04:16] <Cork> oleyb: i meant incompatible
[12:04:29] <Cork> as in the package you can get isn't of an acceptable version
[12:04:39] <Cork> so you need to compile it your self
[12:04:46] <Bloomberg_> dapingwing: Hey, help me!!
[12:05:13] <Cork> (been there done that, almost gave up)
[12:05:15] <oleyb> I've been wanting to do more Go, it just looks a little too foreign and ugly
[12:05:22] <Bloomberg_> Would have some way like this :: $('select[name="dayweek"] ').
[12:05:29] <Bloomberg_> an setting the value
[12:06:15] <Cork> oleyb: it looks like a mix between javascript and erlang and a bit of c
[12:06:21] <Bloomberg_> a*
[12:06:32] <Cork> oleyb: the syntax is actually quite straight forward
[12:06:57] <newtothis> yeah func declarations are much clearer @_@
[12:07:27] <bobbobbins> hey, i used theme roller and put the css file right below the css file for jquery mobile, but it doesn't seem to use any of the styles in my new theme roller theme, is there something else i need to do?
[12:07:29] <oleyb> with variable declarations, having the type come seconds weirded me out :P
[12:07:37] <oleyb> it seemed like an arbitrary decision
[12:07:48] <Cork> newtothis: welcome to ecmascript 6
[12:08:07] <Cork> or harmony as it's nick named
[12:08:38] <dapingwing> Bloomberg_ : sec i just got back
[12:08:57] <Cork> oleyb: declaration has mostly just been simplified to varable := value
[12:09:13] <hXm> hey, i have a div with class="draggable" and i added a script niceEdit.js, i use this for edit the content but i cant do it with class="draggable"
[12:09:13] <Cork> you rarely need to do a real declaration anymore
[12:09:24] <hXm> if i remove the class it works nice, can i do something for manage this?
[12:09:27] <Bloomberg_> Ok
[12:09:35] <dapingwing> Bloomberg_ : What is your question exactly??
[12:09:39] <oleyb> ah, interesting
[12:10:12] <dapingwing> hXm : Elaborate please?
[12:10:19] <oleyb> are there any particular resources you'd recommend for someone looking to get into Go? specifically for creating REST web services?
[12:10:39] <Cork> oleyb: golang.org and there blog
[12:10:48] <Cork> it has tons of good info
[12:10:52] <Bloomberg_> $('select[name="dayweek"]').val("'+<?php echo $numsem; ?>+'").attr('selected', true);
[12:11:03] <dapingwing> uhu
[12:11:13] <dapingwing> doesn't work?
[12:12:04] <oleyb> Cork: Okay, sounds good. Thanks!
[12:12:05] <bobbobbins> never mind, its this stupid templating system I'm using
[12:12:09] <Cork> are you sure "'+<?php echo $numsem; ?>+'" is correct?
[12:12:18] <Bloomberg_> yes!
[12:12:23] <dapingwing> i know why !
[12:12:30] <dapingwing> the ''
[12:12:42] <dapingwing> $numsem doesn't output a var it outputs text
[12:12:47] <dapingwing> so why the ''
[12:13:01] <Bloomberg_> That is integer
[12:13:06] <Bloomberg_> from 1 to 4
[12:13:09] <Cork> btw attr('selected', true); is broken
[12:13:14] <Cork> use prop
[12:13:26] <dapingwing> oh since when cork?
[12:13:30] <Cork> and it should most likely be on an option not the select
[12:13:43] <Cork> dapingwing: attr sets attributes since jquery 1.5
[12:13:49] <Cork> if you want to set a property you use prop
[12:14:02] <dapingwing> looks like i've been asleep some time
[12:14:09] <Cork> attr('selected', 'selected') vs prop('selected', true)
[12:14:14] <iLogic> is there a way to apply drag to div that is beneath a static one?
[12:14:38] <dapingwing> iLogic, i'll help you in a sec
[12:14:57] <iLogic> dapingwing: thanks man
[12:14:59] <dapingwing> so change attr to prop
[12:15:15] <Cork> dapingwing: basically attr was split into attr and prop in 1.5
[12:15:20] <Bloomberg_> I already to changed the attr to prop but nothing
[12:15:44] <dapingwing> Bloomberg_ : why is there val(" ' ' ") ??
[12:15:44] <Cork> before it tried to do both with a weird form of split personality, with bugs as a consequence
[12:16:01] <dapingwing> Cork: thanks , good to know
[12:16:41] <hXm> dapingwing: i have this http://jsfiddle.net/hackemate/mKaeW/1/ -- the line "Profile header" should be editable
[12:16:56] <hXm> if you remove the function it works
[12:19:22] <dapingwing> hXm : trying something give me a sec
[12:19:32] <hXm> ok
[12:22:12] <dapingwing> it's click hijacking
[12:22:31] <dapingwing> so when you click you click on the dragable div
[12:22:37] <dapingwing> instead of the editable region
[12:23:02] <hXm> any chance to avoid it?
[12:23:27] <Xal_> I'm trying to use jquery to call a server side function on an asp.net page. It keeps coming back as succeeded, but the function on the server side never actually gets hit.
[12:23:30] <dapingwing> trying some things
[12:23:57] <Bloomberg_> dapingwing: If the value is equal so should to be selected the option
[12:25:46] <dapingwing> http://jsfiddle.net/mKaeW/2/
[12:25:51] <dapingwing> here you go hXm
[12:26:14] <Xal_> http://pastebin.com/aKFw8Mdu
[12:26:17] <dapingwing> Bloomberg_ : let me think for a sec
[12:27:45] <dapingwing> Bloomberg_ : send me the jsfiddle and code again please
[12:28:43] <dapingwing> who else was on queue with a question ?
[12:28:49] <dapingwing> iLogic?
[12:29:04] <Bloomberg_> http://jsbin.com/umeroz/1/edit
[12:29:13] <Bloomberg_> jjaja
[12:29:39] <dapingwing> http://jsbin.com/umeroz/2/
[12:31:04] <Xal_> dapingwing, I had an ajax question
[12:31:26] <hXm> dapingwing: just great!
[12:31:28] <dapingwing> Xal_ do tell
[12:31:30] <aaas> newbie question: how can i target a decendant of the next element identified with the class '.thisone'?  somethign like $(this).next()....
[12:31:33] <hXm> thanks, i didnt think about cancel: .editable
[12:31:34] <dapingwing> hXm: so works :)
[12:31:41] <hXm> pretty good
[12:31:45] <Bloomberg_> Thanks, Again
[12:31:46] <hXm> thanks again, i was 2 days with this
[12:31:55] <hXm> if there is a fan button, i press it
[12:31:56] <dapingwing> aaas: .child ? or .eq?
[12:32:12] <dapingwing> hXm well i'm here seldom but i do try to help
[12:32:15] <aaas> dapingwing thanks...it's not a direct child...but ill look those up
[12:33:06] <dapingwing> aaas oh sorry i misread
[12:33:07] <dapingwing> sec
[12:33:09] <NoiseEee> aaas: $(this).find('.lookingForThisClass')
[12:33:31] <dapingwing> var a = $(this).find('.thisone'); ?
[12:33:37] <aaas> NoiseEee dapingwing thank you both
[12:34:01] <dapingwing> np
[12:34:08] <rbs> Hello, I have this function http://paste.laravel.com/sJX (.route) I add (route) to the Class and the other parameters to a object, for example a <li> or a <button> and when I click it works.... I need to know how I can call this function from script/command and pass the parameters.. I think I can call .route.click() but I don`t know how to pass the parameters I need for the url and div to load the content.
[12:34:46] <rbs> I need to call .route programatically passing data-route-url and data-route-div
[12:34:59] <dapingwing> rbs wo wo what
[12:35:26] <dapingwing> so like function routecall(data-route-url,data-route-div) ??
[12:37:22] <Saaether> http://paste.laravel.com/sK0 ?
[12:37:43] <Saaether> then you can just call the function with what ever data you want
[12:37:52] <rbs> hm
[12:37:54] <rbs> let me try
[12:38:13] <dapingwing> Saaether : should work :)
[12:38:21] <rbs> but
[12:38:27] <Xal_> I've been looking at this ajax call for hours and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong, or if the problem is server side, or what.
[12:38:31] <rbs> I would need to have both right
[12:38:39] <dapingwing> Xal_ whats the issue again?
[12:38:40] <shoky> $('#'+div).load(url)  should work just as well
[12:38:49] <shoky> rbs ^
[12:38:59] <Xal_> I'm trying to use jquery to call a server side function on an asp.net page. It keeps coming back as succeeded, but the function on the server side never actually gets hit.
[12:39:02] <darcyclarke> $($) â€¦ money
[12:39:13] <dapingwing> Xal_ send me the code ?
[12:39:20] <Xal_> http://pastebin.com/aKFw8Mdu
[12:40:10] <dapingwing> try url "./.....
[12:40:17] <dapingwing>  url: "./attendeelist.aspx/ajaxStatus",
[12:40:41] <Xal_> Same thing
[12:40:46] <Xal_> Same result
[12:41:40] <dapingwing> Xal_ sorry can't help , asp is not really my thing
[12:41:44] <Xal_> ok
[12:41:59] <dapingwing> it's something asp i think
[12:42:26] <rbs> so, I will really have to create a new function... route().. there is no way to invoke the existent one by passing parms
[12:42:49] <dapingwing> yeah but whats the issue with a new function rbs?
[12:42:53] <rbs> (it worked this way) but I`m just thinking weird to have both functions...
[12:43:16] <dapingwing> it's perfect normal code rbs
[12:43:17] <rbs> nothing exactly. just sounds weird to have 2 functions to do the samething
[12:44:01] <dapingwing> nah it's not ,really
[12:44:44] <rbs> thanks guys!
[12:44:54] <dapingwing> np rbs
[12:45:37] <rbs> now I can call  route('/system/users/'+aData.id+'/edit', 'page-content');  from my dataTables when I click the TR :)
[12:56:26] <ph88> does someone know a tool to get the shortest unique (if possible) css selector for a dom element ?
[12:56:59] <dapingwing> ph88 like what?
[12:57:09] <ph88> ??
[12:57:35] <Cork> ph88: that is quite hard to do
[12:57:48] <Cork> as selectors can be expressed in a lot of ways
[12:57:50] <BillCriswell> ph88: Like... if you can get away with just div use div, else do .divsclass, else do .parent div, etc?
[12:57:59] <ph88> i will be ok if it doesn't get perfect results ... just an attempt to do it will be ok
[12:58:40] <ph88> i would assume in any implementation the ID of an element would be the shortest possible
[12:58:56] <ph88> after that perhaps #id > p  or something like that
[12:59:01] <BillCriswell> ph88: Of course, but if it doesn't have an id you can't do it
[12:59:07] <ph88> anyways ... just wondering if there is anything out there like that
[12:59:12] <ph88> google not really helping here
[12:59:18] <dapingwing> dreamweaver has it built in , sorta
[12:59:29] <Cork> ph88: install adblock plus and use its element hiding selector :)
[12:59:32] <BillCriswell> ph88: It's a weird thing to attempt.
[13:00:05] <Cork> some of the html views in browsers i think provides it too
[13:00:11] <NoiseEee> ph88: know that whatever selector you use make zero difference in the speed of your app, providing you have an acceptable number of elements.
[13:00:25] <BillCriswell> I'd like to see sass get something built in where it would remove unnecessary parent selectors when it's compiled.
[13:00:38] <Cork> NoiseEee: that isn't true actually
[13:00:43] <ph88> i like something programmatically ...
[13:00:52] <Cork> selectors can make a ton of difference for quite small set of elements
[13:01:55] <BillCriswell> Using * as a child selector can be a bit expensive, but other than that I think you're really splitting hairs if you're worried about a selector.
[13:02:28] <Cork> BillCriswell: for example something i've seen a lot is things like div#id
[13:02:37] <ph88> i find it hard to belief nobody made something like this :| anyway ...
[13:02:41] <BillCriswell> Cork: Well that's pointless haha
[13:02:44] <Cork> where you actually force the browser to select all the divs on the page and then pick the one with a uniq id
[13:02:50] <BillCriswell> ph88: It's not really essential.
[13:02:55] <Cork> BillCriswell: i see it almost daly in here
[13:03:03] <Cork> *daily
[13:03:07] <BillCriswell> Cork: That's no fun.
[13:03:12] <ph88> BillCriswell: essential for what purpose ?!
[13:03:37] <c4ptnh00k> can anyone point out the stupid thing i left out to make the second modal dialog open? http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/SNJLN/4/
[13:03:53] <Cork> ph88: you find it hard to write the selectors or what is the point of it all?
[13:04:15] <iLogic> dapingwing: i'm back, sorry
[13:04:30] <shoky> c4ptnh00k:  a # sign
[13:04:37] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: line 14
[13:04:40] <dapingwing> back guys ! :D
[13:04:42] <c4ptnh00k> omg ty
[13:04:45] <BillCriswell> shoky: Damn, nice.
[13:05:05] <BillCriswell> . are stealthy little bastards
[13:05:13] <BillCriswell> # on the other hand ;)
[13:05:16] <BillCriswell> I still didn't see it haha
[13:05:38] <c4ptnh00k> lol went right past it like a hundred times
[13:05:38] <shoky> ;P
[13:05:57] <BillCriswell> I wonder if anyone has taken the time to count how many grid frameworks are out there
[13:05:58] <ph88> Cork: yes aid in the search for the right css selector can be helpful
[13:06:17] <BillCriswell> It has to be in the 500ish range
[13:06:28] <Cork> ph88: and just right clicking the target element in the browser isn't easy enough?
[13:07:25] <Cork> ph88: right click > inspect > right click element in inspector view > copy unique selector
[13:07:27] <BillCriswell> ph88: Just use the one that relies on the least amount of spaces. =)
[13:09:29] <ph88> Cork:  which browser is that ? i'm using Iron now and i don't see the copy unique selector option
[13:09:37] <ph88> i do see copy XPath
[13:09:47] <BillCriswell> Iron?
[13:09:59] <ph88> Chromium fork
[13:10:03] <BillCriswell> Oh
[13:10:10] <Cork> ph88: this specific one was the firefox inspector
[13:10:21] <Cork> but firebug has it too
[13:12:14] <ph88> ok ill have a look
[13:12:42] <ph88> html.no-js body.section div#content-body.constrain div.primary-col article#article-12345.post div.entry-content figure.entry-thumb img
[13:12:55] <ph88> not really the shortest css selector with that method ...
[13:12:59] <BillCriswell> Can't get more unique that that...
[13:13:08] <BillCriswell> ph88: Are you really running with no JS?
[13:13:21] <BillCriswell> Or just didn't include modernizr?
[13:13:30] <ph88> that's not my website
[13:13:32] <ph88> it's time.com
[13:13:51] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:13:56] <ph88> anyway   from the last example ... i think this is still unique:   #article-12345.post div.entry-content figure.entry-thumb img
[13:14:00] <ph88> and that's half the size ..
[13:14:23] <BillCriswell> ph88: You're focusing on the wrong things.
[13:14:27] <ph88> o_O
[13:14:54] <Cork> BillCriswell: if nothing else reducing the size of the selector makes it easier to read
[13:15:17] <BillCriswell> Cork: Haha I know.
[13:15:35] <Cork> ph88: can you make the selector relative?
[13:15:36] <BillCriswell> I'd just use .class or .id, then include a .parent before it if I needed to, and keep going back as I have to.
[13:15:51] <Cork> that normally makes huge difference in selector length
[13:15:51] <dabear> wait, html.no-js?
[13:16:05] <ph88> http://time.com  + noscript
[13:16:07] <dabear> how could your selector possibly work if js is disabled?:p
[13:16:21] <BillCriswell> Why noscript? :-/
[13:16:36] <Cork> uh...
[13:16:55] <Cork> cause why run random code all over the web
[13:17:26] <dapingwing> miss anything intresting ?
[13:17:34] <Cork> ph88: btw there is no noscript for chrome/chromium/...
[13:17:43] <bobbobbins> I'm using query mobile with a list viewâ€¦and i have an image on the left, but it doesn't center itselfâ€¦is there a way to do that easily?
[13:17:54] <jedimind> yes, css
[13:18:13] <Cork> ph8: it's "noscripts" and it has no relation what so ever with noscript
[13:18:22] <ccmonster> i have a list of elements, how do I find which in my list of elements has a particular class
[13:18:22] <bobbobbins> hmm, i tried that but it didn't seem to like it, i guess i'll keep poking at it
[13:18:26] <BillCriswell> Do you individually allow sites to run javascript? Just seems like a pain in the ass.
[13:18:30] <Cork> and it is not secure like noscript is
[13:20:02] <Cork> dapingwing: not really as i whitelist scripts i know belongs to safe sources
[13:20:39] <Cork> that is kinda the point also noscript does a lot more then just blocking scripts
[13:20:58] <ph88> Cork: i use two browsers, so it's ok there is no noscript in chrome
[13:22:03] <clov3r> ccmonster: $yourList.find('.class')
[13:22:16] <ccmonster> hmm.
[13:23:06] <BillCriswell> ccmonster: Might have to do $yourList.filter('.class')
[13:23:23] <ccmonster> that didn't seem to work
[13:23:26] <ccmonster> those were the first two i tried
[13:23:43] <ccmonster> ahh. filter did
[13:23:49] <ph88> Cork:  i was refering to this https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/noscript/  not sure what you were talking about
[13:23:49] <ccmonster> needed the dot
[13:24:12] <Cork> ?g extension chrome noscripts
[13:24:12] <b-ot> Cork: Chrome Web Store - NotScripts â†’ https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notscripts/odjhifogjcknibkahlpidmdajjpkkcfn?hl=en
[13:24:14] <bot-t> Cork, Chrome Web Store - NotScripts - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notscripts/odjhifogjcknibkahlpidmdajjpkkcfn?hl=en
[13:24:19] <Cork> ph88: ^
[13:24:25] <BillCriswell> Does that basically just.... disable javascript?
[13:24:32] <Cork> it is as much noscript as flashblock...
[13:24:44] <Cork> BillCriswell: no
[13:24:52] <Cork> not even close
[13:25:10] <BillCriswell> Hmmm... ok haha
[13:25:32] <Cork> BillCriswell: it selectively let you decide from what server you want to load scripts
[13:25:39] <Cork> and the reset will just not be loaded
[13:25:46] <Cork> like ex. googleanalytics.com
[13:26:32] <Cork> it also xss protection, cross ip scopes protection (public => private ip) click jacking and a few other things
[13:27:33] <Cork> oh, and it also disalbes plugins until you explicitly load them
[13:28:05] <ph88> BillCriswell, Cork  this looks very much like what i wanted http://www.selectorgadget.com/
[13:29:13] <Cork> ph88: well looks like it does the same as the built in i talked about
[13:29:32] <ph88> then i didnt get your explanation before ...
[13:29:45] <ph88> i was getting a really big css selector when i tried one of your suggestions
[13:30:04] <BillCriswell> ph88: This returns "li a" for a lot of elements on time.com
[13:30:11] <BillCriswell> that couldn't possibly be what you were looking for?
[13:31:01] <ph88> i have yet to test it, but as far as i understand you can reject the false positives until it will come up with a truelly unique selecter for your element ... which will then be the shortest css selector possible
[13:31:35] <BillCriswell> Well... hopefully you find what you're looking for.
[13:32:41] <Cork> can't say i've ever felt the need for a tool like that but, hey everyone there own
[13:33:52] <BillCriswell> Indeed.
[13:34:06] <BillCriswell> Kind of like that noscript thing you were tlaking about haha.
[13:34:14] <BillCriswell> could be useful, just not as far as I can see.
[13:34:34] <ph88> some websites load javascript from 10 other websites ...
[13:34:47] <BillCriswell> I'm in the #go-nuts room. I feel like a dumbass.
[13:34:55] <ph88> :P
[13:34:58] <eddiemonge> why would they do that?
[13:35:27] <ph88> mainly analytics / trackers / social network stuff /advertisement / cdn's / content  / etc etc
[13:36:19] <Cork> BillCriswell: almost every remote exploit in flash, java, and firefox as : workaround use noscript :)
[13:36:29] <Cork> BillCriswell: that is why it is a good idea
[13:36:39] <Cork> also i use it to block ads
[13:37:01] <ph88> damn that selecter gadget tool is 4 years old !!!
[13:37:36] <Cork> eddiemonge: look at any bigger site, and you will have javascript loading from at least 5 domains
[13:37:50] <eddiemonge> 5 yes but never 10 ;)
[13:38:02] <Cork> check humblebundle.com
[13:38:19] <BillCriswell> I guess it just doesn't bother me. Never really had an issue.
[13:38:40] <Cork> BillCriswell: you don't care aboout tracking cookies too i guess?
[13:38:51] <BillCriswell> Cork: Not really.
[13:39:10] <Cork> well then ya, we are quite a bit apart then :)
[13:39:20] <BillCriswell> Cork: Haha, absolutely.
[13:39:47] <BillCriswell> Cork: I use Incognito for 99% of my browsing.
[13:40:00] <Cork> BillCriswell: i go as far as develop an extension to make localStorage not store things cause of tracking purposes
[13:40:34] <Cork> or rather cause it doens't ask before it lets the server store things
[13:42:37] <eddiemonge> <rant>why doesnt bestbuy sell nexus 7? makes me sad cuz i have giftcards there but they have nothing else i want. </rant>
[13:42:43] <dapingwing> well guys i'm off :D cya later !
[13:42:55] <BillCriswell> Latterrr
[13:43:22] <c4ptnh00k> god i wish it was friday
[13:43:31] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Wait in line at best buy for someone paying with cash and offer a trade.
[13:43:56] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: tried that once. BB didnt like that.
[13:44:16] <Cork> can't see why XD
[13:44:53] <BillCriswell> That's kind of like the time I got kick out of the bar for buying a 6 pack from the bar and giving them out to my friends.
[13:45:17] <c4ptnh00k> that makes no sense
[13:45:28] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Well, they still kicked meout.
[13:45:52] <c4ptnh00k> yeah and did you go back?
[13:46:00] <BillCriswell> Not that night.
[13:46:04] <c4ptnh00k> lol
[13:46:25] <BillCriswell> I ended up drinking in the parking lot of the bar with some others who were kicked out.
[13:46:26] <c4ptnh00k> I've generally deserved to get kicked out of places
[13:46:55] <BillCriswell> It sucks when you get kicked out of the bar and you don't drive. =(
[13:47:02] <BillCriswell> Well.. didn't drive that night
[13:47:11] <c4ptnh00k> ouch
[13:47:45] <BillCriswell> My friends were too drunk to realize I was gone, sucked haha
[13:48:11] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: That was the only place I've ever been kicked out of.
[13:49:35] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: I wish I could say that I have only been kicked out of one place. I got Kicked out of walmart one time for having a demolition derby with the shopping carts in the produce section
[13:49:50] <BillCriswell> that's reasonable
[13:50:00] <c4ptnh00k> I was 17 so what the heck
[13:50:11] <jedimind> this whole thing seems rather off topic
[13:50:17] <c4ptnh00k> eh
[13:50:18] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Extremely.
[13:50:32] <c4ptnh00k> depends on the topic at hand
[13:50:32] <BillCriswell> No one is asking any good questions though.
[13:50:38] <c4ptnh00k> exactly
[13:51:02] <jedimind> im not trying to be a zealot, just commenting
[13:51:10] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Why do you hate us.
[13:51:17] <c4ptnh00k> are you trying to play mind tricks on us...
[13:51:28] <ph88> cool stuff guys: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/
[13:51:33] <jedimind> BillCriswell dont flatter yourself, i hate all things equally, its nothing specific to you
[13:51:38] <BillCriswell> :)
[13:51:41] <jedimind> i just dislike all things with extreme prejudice
[13:51:44] <eddiemonge> jedimind: you are always such a buzzkill lol
[13:51:51] <jedimind> true
[13:52:06] <jedimind> for the first time in my life, i have way too much screen realestate
[13:52:29] <jedimind> i remember having 3x19" tube monitors taking up probably something like 11 cubic miles of space on my desk
[13:52:32] <jedimind> and was like "shit i need more"
[13:52:38] <jedimind> now i have 2x27" and i have no idea wtf to do with it
[13:52:45] <BillCriswell> jedimind: This seems really off topic.
[13:52:54] <jedimind> its entirely on topic
[13:52:54] <c4ptnh00k> extremely
[13:53:02] <jedimind> these are the monitors i use to code jquery
[13:53:17] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Damn. You must have a law background.
[13:53:21] <BillCriswell> I can't compete with that.
[13:53:21] <c4ptnh00k> one does not simply code jquery
[13:54:31] <eddiemonge> do not try and bend jquery but rather, realize there is no jquery
[13:54:50] <BillCriswell> I got like 99% done this coded I needed to write like... 2 hours ago. Can't get myself to do that 1%.
[13:55:19] <BillCriswell> You know what... it's actually done. I'm just not acknowledging it's done
[13:55:54] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: And that would normally be my 3 oclock
[13:56:10] <ph88> 2x27" at work :D
[13:56:25] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: It's sad.
[13:56:32] <BillCriswell> I could accomplish so much if I wasn't so apathetic.
[13:56:39] <c4ptnh00k> but if you tell them at 3 you wont look like such a badass when they need something by 2
[13:56:42] <jedimind> ph88 yeah same, its just so much though
[13:56:46] <jedimind> i have to like move my chair
[13:57:03] <BillCriswell> Moving chairs is for losers and skinnies.
[13:57:13] <ph88> sometimes i just put windows in a certain area of the screen ... so its ok :P
[13:57:16] <jedimind> and for people playing musical chairs
[13:57:33] <BillCriswell> "Oklahoma senator: Tornado aid 'totally different' from Sandy aid"
[13:57:39] <c4ptnh00k> musical chairs implies movement though
[13:57:53] <BillCriswell> I'd love to grasp logic like that.
[13:58:01] <c4ptnh00k> i say more music less movement
[13:58:07] <ph88> postively different ?
[14:01:25] <BillCriswell> ph88: Ha.
[14:04:10] <c4ptnh00k> ($=function (){return("($="+$+")()" )})()
[14:04:28] <ph88> that gonna format my disk ?
[14:04:36] <c4ptnh00k> yup
[14:04:37] <jedimind> yes, twice
[14:04:39] <BillCriswell> My computer is working just fi
[14:05:04] <BillCriswell> I still like the batman one.
[14:05:28] <vsync_> the what one?
[14:05:32] <BillCriswell> Array(16).join('wat' - 1) + ' Batman'
[14:05:47] <c4ptnh00k> i try not to use that one. he might come and get me
[14:06:28] <c4ptnh00k> now we just need it to play the music with the words
[14:07:06] <vsync_> i'm thinking there are easier ways to achieve nan than that
[14:07:30] <c4ptnh00k> as a quine?
[14:07:32] <BillCriswell> vsync_: It's to keep it from being obvious.... presumably
[14:07:46] <c4ptnh00k> oh i got ya
[14:07:49] <c4ptnh00k> yea
[14:07:51] <c4ptnh00k> um
[14:07:54] <c4ptnh00k> yeah
[14:08:08] <vsync_> oh i think i've heard about that technique
[14:08:14] <vsync_> it's called batman by obfuscation
[14:08:23] <BillCriswell> Array(16).join(NaN) + ' Batman'
[14:08:26] <BillCriswell> for instance.
[14:09:21] <vsync_> nevermind that, obscurity, not obfuscation
[14:09:29] <vsync_> english is such a stupid language
[14:10:02] <vsync_> obscurity sounds so much cooler and more pro
[14:10:21] <BillCriswell> I speak pro english.
[14:10:36] <c4ptnh00k> but i pro speak english
[14:11:20] <c4ptnh00k> word swapping fun
[14:12:17] <eddiemonge> english speak, I pro
[14:12:36] <vsync_> engrish. do you speak it
[14:16:29] <roger_raymond> edraw
[14:16:43] <c4ptnh00k> I am Kim Jong-il and I are so Wronry
[14:17:35] <c4ptnh00k> ugh no world police fans :(
[14:17:50] <vsync_> do not speak ill of the dead
[14:18:15] <vsync_> now there's Kim Jong-Un and he's such a cool guy
[14:18:24] <vsync_> even better than his predecessor
[14:18:50] <c4ptnh00k> ...? why not they wont get offended
[14:19:42] <vsync_> they can't speak for themselves
[14:19:58] <vsync_> and also, kimjongskill would be glad to whoop your puny lil ass!
[14:20:18] <c4ptnh00k> lol

[14:46:04] <Xeon06> Hey guys
[14:46:16] <Xeon06> Can anyone help me with a bug I'm having with the anims and .clearQueue? http://jsfiddle.net/jWkbK/1/
[14:48:24] <dokma> do I have to .each(function() { funcName($(this)); }); or can I .each(funcName($(this))); or some similar shorthand like that?
[14:49:28] <Assim_Build> it appears that dragging draggables onto droppables uses the center of the helper object being over the droppbable. Is there a way to use the cursor position instead? (for this fiddle drag AND, OR, or NOT to the dotted box on the right:http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/30/)
[14:50:02] <quietschie> hi, can anyone tell me why my array is no longer an array? http://jsfiddle.net/3jwpN/
[14:52:35] <Pavlov> i have something where i need to set text() and then get the size of that element
[14:52:41] <Pavlov> whats the best way to do that, since it doesn't happen immediately?
[14:52:45] <guideX> any idea how to increase the width of an jquery ui ajax tab
[14:53:34] <Assim_Build> guideX: what do you mean ajax tab?
[14:54:17] <guideX> http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[14:54:29] <guideX> well http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#ajax
[14:55:23] <Assim_Build> ok so a tab loaded with ajax, and you want to change the width? you mean differently than the width of the whole tab widget?
[14:55:40] <guideX> well if I have text which is too long, it doesn't auto expand
[14:55:50] <guideX> so the tab text hangs off the side of the tabs
[14:56:06] <Assim_Build> is your text wrapped in <pre> elements?
[14:56:34] <guideX> no pre, but there's a span
[14:57:26] <Assim_Build> there are few reasons why text should 'overflow' out of a tab, one of them is if you have a <pre> element. Could you draft up a fiddle or do you have a live link?
[14:57:53] <guideX> yeah 1 sec..
[14:59:53] <Assim_Build> Pavlov: i'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'it doesn't happen immediately'. Simple answer $('selector-to-my-object').text('text to set as object's content').width() or .height()
[15:01:51] <Assim_Build> in case anyone sees my question i found the answer, nvm
[15:27:34] <boytoy_> Trying to launch jQuery Mobile's panel on hover like the new Google+: http://jsfiddle.net/WCP4F/9/
[15:27:37] <boytoy_> But is there a way to move the scroll bar from the window to the panel? Otherwise the panel will collapse when the user hovers off it to scroll.

[20:00:05] <Forbidd3n> any way to count number of parent ul from nested li?
[20:03:48] <lenswipee> yes
[20:04:36] <Forbidd3n> when I do .closest('.class').closest('.same_class') it only pulls the first closest, not the next one up the list
[20:04:50] <lenswipee> $(this).find('ul:parents');
[20:04:57] <lenswipee> something like that
[20:07:00] <Forbidd3n> I figured it out. I am doing .parents('.class').length

[21:17:29] <angelazou> hi, I need to hide the gmnoprint class in the HTML, but jQuery("#gmap").find(".gmnoprint").hide(); won't do the job

[21:21:38] <thomas> hello?

[21:27:07] <lenswipee> angelazou: try using css
[21:27:38] <angelazou> lenswipee: did try, doesn't inject style either
[21:33:00] <lenswipee> angelazou: The problem is that your selector you are using is not "strong" enough.
[21:33:28] <angelazou> soo jQuery("irc://chat.freenode.net/#gmap").find(".gmnoprint")[0].hide(); ?
[21:33:29] <lenswipee> angelazou: Try to be even more specific
[21:33:56] <lenswipee> angelazou: TIAS

[22:19:46] <jop008> any expert on security?
[22:24:12] <jop008> how to make use of a certificate trusting web content ?
[22:25:09] <Cork> jop008: certificate trusting?
[22:25:16] <Cork> are you talking about a user cert?
[22:25:20] <Cork> or...?
[22:25:27] <jop008> trusting access to a mobile web app
[22:25:37] <jop008> a device must have a certificate
[22:25:49] <jop008> what do I need for this?
[22:26:38] <Cork> there isn't really much access to certs from javascript
[22:27:16] <jop008> I think it must on top of JS some middleware technology
[22:27:26] <jop008> all the webapps must be treated the same
[22:27:53] <Cork> there is work on a crypto component as a webstandard
[22:28:12] <Cork> but in the wild there isn't anything standardized as far as i know
[22:33:19] <jop008> Sounding not hopefull
[22:33:51] <jop008> Is it not possible to download a certificate on the device and then ask credentials
[22:34:20] <Cork> you can't do crypto in javascript, as the variables is accessable from third party
[22:34:22] <jop008> for jscript you ask to a middle ware solution who handles the seecurity
[22:34:37] <Cork> ?g w3c crypto

[22:34:39] <bot-t1> Cork, W3C Web Cryptography Working Group - http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/
[22:34:46] <jop008> No crypto not on JS code
[22:34:50] <jop008> I agree
[22:34:57] <myndzi> inb4 diffie hellman
[22:35:12] <jop008> I want SSL for connection type securing data transfer
[22:35:19] <Cork> jop008: sure you can use proprietary browser plugins to access cert data
[22:35:59] <jop008>  So for all devices different pluginss needed
[22:36:21] <Cork> not necessary, it just means there isn't a standard
[22:36:45] <Cork> so you would have to check for/install whats needed
[22:42:51] <jop008> where to look for digital certifcate SSL plugin?
[22:43:04] <jop008> No open source solution on this?
[22:44:36] <Cork> the only ones i know of is for specific purposes
[22:44:46] <Cork> like bankid.com
[22:53:52] <boytoy_> I got an anchor whose width is set to 100% -- but how to measure the width of just the text? http://jsfiddle.net/MhXqH/
[22:54:14] <Cork> boytoy_: you can't really
[22:54:25] <boytoy_> oh.. hmm
[22:54:32] <Cork> add an extra element in it with display: inline-block
[22:54:45] <boytoy_> cool i could do that
[22:54:48] <Cork> <a><span>text</span></a>
[22:58:34] <maZtaiR> hi guys, is there a better way to do something like this? http://dpaste.org/XDXzx/
[22:58:42] <maZtaiR> it's not really DRY..
[22:59:13] <redner> can i asked ajax questions in here?
[22:59:42] <Cork> maZtaiR: show_toolip.apply(null, arguments);
[23:00:04] <Cork> or actually just onRegionClick: show_tooltip
[23:00:55] <Cork> redner: ask the question and we'll see
[23:01:29] <redner> i installled an ajax loader in wordpress
[23:01:45] <redner> and its asking for load code
[23:01:49] <redner> but then wants click code
[23:01:50] <boytoy_> I'm trying to measure the width of a span and then position the below paragraph next to it -- am I doing it right? http://jsfiddle.net/MhXqH/1/
[23:01:52] <redner> that is all jquery
[23:02:02] <redner> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/94379a3abc6a316c93ef
[23:03:04] <Cork> redner: that doesn't seam to be ajax related, but wordpress related; ask in there forum
[23:03:32] <redner> no?
[23:03:46] <redner> The question revolves around setting up an ajax loader
[23:03:59] <redner> how is that wordpress related
[23:04:08] <Cork> and that sounds like a wordpress specific function
[23:04:15] <redner> hmm
[23:04:34] <Cork> boytoy_: closest looks for a parent, not a sibling
[23:05:20] <boytoy_> oh right!
[23:05:20] <Cork> boytoy_: http://jsfiddle.net/MhXqH/2/
[23:05:58] <boytoy_> Cork: great :)
[23:06:07] <Cork> boytoy_: why aren't you just floating the a tag?
[23:06:46] <boytoy_> Cork: well the a tag has to be width 100%
[23:07:01] <boytoy_> or can i float the span perhaps?
[23:07:56] <boytoy_> Cork: just curious why doesnt our fiddle manage to get the *exact* text width?
[23:08:09] <Cork> it does
[23:08:27] <Cork> buty you need to calculate the offset and margin, border too
[23:08:31] <Cork> *but
[23:08:36] <Cork> ?.outerWidth
[23:08:44] <Cork> `api outerWidth

[23:43:05] <lemonsparrow> hi right now I am implementing jquery autocomplete in a very normal way.. what happens in this case is that the user, after selecting a value can edit the value in the textfield further... this is making me add one more validation to compare the textfield value with the other values in the array for autocomplete using a submit event handler to check if the user edited the value in the textfield after chosing it from autocomplete
[23:43:28] <lemonsparrow> make the users select value from autocomplete without being able to make him edit it ?
