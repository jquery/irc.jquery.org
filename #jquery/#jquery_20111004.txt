[00:00:44] <JohnnyDavidson> How come when I do var y = x;
[00:00:47] <JohnnyDavidson> x being an arry
[00:01:01] <JohnnyDavidson> Then whatever I do to y gets done to x?
[00:01:09] <Hooloovoo> cause it's just a reference
[00:01:35] <rgr> very strange problem I have which I hope someone might have a crazy idea about : I have an edit form, "#e". I serialize it with record=$("#e").serializeArray(). On one page and one page only the values for this serialization are repeated : the array contains two sets of the same data - one from before the change and one from after the change to the form. I looked at the source - only once #e. I searched the dom, only one #e that I can
[00:01:35] <rgr> see. Any ideas how to approach tracking this down?
[00:01:37] <JohnnyDavidson> How would I do it right?
[00:01:50] <Jakey> js noob
[00:01:51] <Jakey> goto #javascript
[00:02:46] <coldhead> rgr: i would add a "debugger;" statement just before the serializeArray call in the JS
[00:02:50] <coldhead> and see who is calling it
[00:02:52] <coldhead> and when
[00:02:55] <coldhead> and what happens
[00:03:21] <rgr> I know whos calling it. a click event. and what happens is that serializeArray returns double sets of values.
[00:04:09] <rgr> its definitely jquery side and not php side after an ajax transfer too.
[00:04:24] <coldhead> then that still leaves open my suggestion to see what happens in the debugger
[00:04:54] <rgr> what procedure do you propose I use to debug serializeArray?
[00:05:27] <coldhead> well, i would inspect what arguments it was receiving
[00:05:43] <coldhead> and try to work out how they differ from the other pages
[00:05:57] <rgr> $("#e").serializeArray(). How would I debug that then?
[00:06:18] <coldhead> console.log($('#e'))
[00:06:23] <rgr> ok.
[00:06:24] <coldhead> console.log($('#e *'))
[00:06:33] <coldhead> console.log($('#e input'))
[00:06:34] <coldhead> etc
[00:08:18] <rgr> being a bit of a noob, do I need to set up anythign specially to get this debugger; statement to trigger?
[00:08:26] <rgr> am usign chrome
[00:09:28] <ravenzz> no
[00:09:59] <coldhead> it should Just Work, rgr
[00:10:05] <ravenzz> you should take a look at the developer tools' console
[00:10:08] <coldhead> and you'll be paused right there
[00:10:22] <coldhead> with all the delicious context laying before you like a nymphomaniac
[00:10:30] <rgr> didnt trigger. BUT opening the inspector then console I can then query jquery elements as you suggested.
[00:10:53] <ravenzz> ?demo rgr
[00:10:54] <bot-t> ravenzz, JQuerySprint/irclog - All times are EDT(GMT-4) http://docs.jquery.com/JQuerySprint/irclog
[00:10:56] <rgr> developer tools console == console right?
[00:10:57] <ravenzz> lol
[00:11:02] <ravenzz> ?demo @ rgr
[00:11:03] <bot-t> rgr, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:11:10] <ravenzz> yep that one
[00:11:40] <rgr> jesus stop firing "demo" snippets, there is no demo to give. I am asking about approaches to debugging jquery from the masters...
[00:12:05] <rgr> coldhead: thanks. a great help. got me moving.
[00:12:21] <rgr> (though dont know why the debugger didnt bring up the inspector/console)
[00:12:31] <ravenzz> rgr fixingthesejquery.com
[00:12:33] <ravenzz> have fun
[00:12:54] <rgr> now thats a useful site. thanks.
[00:14:48] <rgr> wow, I've been working for 2 days with blinkers on. should have done more prep. didnt know it was a fully featured debugger with breakpoints etc. LOL! minus several million for good thinking. thats what comes hanging out in the wrong bars...
[00:16:29] <rhizmoe> so, is there a common tricky bit for getJSON, noobwise? i have a json url that works just fine by hand, but i get bupkis via getJSON
[00:16:31] <coldhead> rgr: you should check out paul irish's recent presentation at google IO about the debugger
[00:16:35] <coldhead> lots of nice tools
[00:16:57] <coldhead> rhizmoe: the leading problem is attempting to fetch data across domains
[00:17:02] <coldhead> which you can't do
[00:17:11] <JohnnyDavidson> Does anyone know a lot about canvas element?
[00:17:19] <coldhead> if it's the same domain then make sure you json is valid according to jsonlint.com
[00:17:38] <coldhead> and if it's still valid and on the same domain and it doesn't work, time to pour yourself a scotch
[00:17:44] <coldhead> and settle in for the ride of your life
[00:17:46] <rgr> but heres a strange thing : "scripts" has vanished from my inspector menu .. again .. latest chrome.
[00:18:00] <coldhead> ack that's very unhelpful rgr
[00:18:06] <coldhead> i've never seen that occur
[00:18:22] <rhizmoe> even if it's a RESTful call? this is from a file:// to http: tho
[00:19:00] <rgr> coldhead: http://imgur.com/d01LB
[00:19:19] <rgr> juggling this and german grammar probably isnt a good idea "so early"...
[00:19:55] <ravenzz> rhizmoe jsonp? is the domain you are requesting yours?
[00:21:19] <rhizmoe> it's all dev side for now, but I do control everything. I would think that it would be just like pulling a timeline from twitter, just stick a getJSON wherever you see a datasource slot..
[00:22:41] <ravenzz> so if i understand you are playing with the twitter's apis?
[00:23:54] <rgr> well, I restart chrome 14.0.835.186 , my click function has a debugger; statement but it doesnt break. just walks right over it.
[00:23:58] <rhizmoe> no, it's just a json call from some script-tag stuff in a file to an app running on localhost. just http://localhost/foos/35.json
[00:24:41] <ravenzz> wtf from http://foo.com to http://localhost
[00:24:42] <ravenzz> ?
[00:30:39] <rgr> Naive Q perhaps, but it is possible to debug click functions right? breakpoint is set, debugger; statement is there too and I click the button and it just runs straight through.
[00:31:14] <NodeX> retun out of it
[00:31:18] <NodeX> return *
[00:31:26] <rgr> its set using jquery e.g $("#save").click= function(){...});
[00:31:40] <NodeX> that's bad syntax
[00:31:52] <rgr> why is it bad syntax?
[00:31:54] <NodeX> $().click(funciton(){});
[00:32:24] <rgr> ignore the =
[00:32:34] <rgr> its as you typed
[00:32:37] <NodeX> psatebin your code
[00:34:30] <rgr> not that its relevant to a Q about whether click functions constructed like that can be debugged, but http://pastebin.com/KsT09wLc
[00:36:05] <NodeX> nothing is telling the script to return out of it
[00:36:23] <rgr> how does that affect a debugger; statement?
[00:36:42] <NodeX> how should I know
[00:37:09] <rgr> because thats what I am asking about. the script doesnt return a value (but probably could or should but its not iportant in this case).
[00:37:30] <NodeX> err does the url "ajax" exist >?
[00:37:49] <rgr> ok, you dont know what I am asking. Im not asking about the ajax stuff. That all works fine.
[00:38:01] <NodeX> so what's the problem
[00:38:04] <rgr> I am asking about getting breakpoints working in chrome.
[00:38:10] <NodeX> #chrome
[00:38:19] <NodeX> it's outside the scope of this chanel
[00:38:27] <rgr> or firefox ...
[00:38:34] <NodeX> console.log
[00:38:43] <rgr> The general question was about debugging click functions : see above to the first Q you replied to.
[00:38:51] <rgr>  09:30
[00:39:10] <NodeX> If it's jquery related then I will help, if it's not then I won't because it's outside the scope
[00:45:13] <rgr> (And I bet it comes down to some antiquated java version on debian...)
[00:46:54] <hesh> hey guys got none cake question, im trying to get the use time line from a twitter account, how do i limit the number of tweets i get back
[00:46:58] <rgr> well, killed chrome completely, restart and now debugging works. linux desktop gui apps...
[00:49:56] <NodeX> hesh : this is #jquery lol not #cakephp
[00:51:45] <DThought> i've got a page with draggable divs that show some information, the user can gather while scrolling through a huge list. The user can make new divs appear (~100x200px in size), is there a way to place them automatically in way they don't obtruse other divs?
[00:52:29] <DThought> s/obtruse/obscure/
[00:53:42] <NodeX> Doesn't really make sense without seeing an example
[00:54:12] <hesh> ah hit lolsorry guys
[00:54:25] <Hierofant> DThought might be a plugin for that.  Or, use a position lookup table
[00:55:28] <DThought> Hierofant: lookup table = keep track of the positions, and when placing trying to place until i got a empty space?
[00:55:44] <Hierofant> just when you place a new img
[00:55:56] <Hierofant> poll the others for their size and x,y offsets
[00:56:05] <sjuxax> Hello. I have arbitrary input which I am trying to set as a textarea's .html(). I parse this input so that it's written out to the page with entities like &lt; for <, but these entities are rendered as the real character when I set textarea's HTML, even if I wrap in various contortions of .text(). I need to know how to take &lt;script&gt;, write it out to the textarea so it looks like <script>, without actually executing the contents.
[00:56:16] <DThought> yes, thats what's need to be done. I just wanted tto sure i won't be reinventing the wheel
[00:56:16] <sjuxax> I've been fiddling with this for a long time and tried lots of SO answers, nothing is working for me
[00:57:43] <NodeX> sjuxax : pastebin your code

[01:15:16] <Mech0z> Is it possible to get a dialog to not be moved to the bottem of my HTML doc? I have some code inside a accordion that is made into a dialog, but when it does that its moved outside the accordion
[01:21:25] <sjuxax> NodeX: test case at http://stoprockvideo.com/jq_test.html
[01:22:33] <sjuxax> also on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/vkRkt/1/
[01:38:40] <rgr> goddam it. chrome showing the scripts is hit and miss here on debian.
[01:43:37] <maxw> is there a way to get the icon on the *left* of a button in a listview (using jquery-mobile)? it is on the right by default...I tried the attributes that can be added to regular buttons, but it just adds *another* icon on the left...
[01:45:28] <timing> Hi, my jslint validation sometimes says: 'be careful when making functions in a loop. Consider putting the function in a closure'. I understand why I have to be careful. However, how do I put this function in a closure?
[01:45:59] <timing> I tried adding (function(){ ... }); at various locations, but still no luck with validation
[01:57:04] <red> Why doesn't elem.trigger('change'); trigger my event on those fields?
[01:57:59] <NodeX> didn't you ask this yesterdya ?
[01:58:03] <NodeX> yesterday* ?
[01:58:10] <red> me?
[01:58:15] <NodeX> yes
[01:58:32] <red> couple of days ago iirc, but I resolved that particular issue otherwise
[01:58:54] <red> I keep seeing info about the change supposedly working but I can't reproduce, odd
[01:59:11] <NodeX> [11:09:47] <red> I've tried .trigger('change') and adding a change handler but didnt work either
[01:59:11] <NodeX> [11:10:13] <red> The problem is that I can't call my function from the scope of where the .val() is being pushed to the input field, so I cannot trigger it directly
[01:59:11] <NodeX> [11:10:26] <NodeX> change() is a series of events
[01:59:11] <NodeX> [11:10:32] <NodeX> try trigger blur
[02:00:30] <red> ah yes, the .blur() didn't do squat tho
[02:00:42] <red> though I'm unsure what it should do in any case? blur the field?
[02:00:56] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[02:01:27] <red> will take a while, dynamicly generated, ill try to strip stuff and make an example, brb
[02:05:54] <helpcrypto> hi all
[02:06:12] <helpcrypto> im tying to detect windows 7, xp and vista using jquery
[02:06:25] <helpcrypto> but doesnt seem to work
[02:06:42] <helpcrypto> (xp and vista are both NT 6.1 on useragent)
[02:06:43] <sjuxax> Anyone know a good injection stress test? I want a script that tries to inject JavaScript into all my fields to see if it will win or fail
[02:06:51] <helpcrypto> any idea how could i solve it?
[02:08:23] <blackspotwiggins> helpcrypto, xp is 5.1 or 5.2 not 6
[02:10:16] <helpcrypto_> navigator.userAgent returns 6.1 on XP
[02:10:26] <helpcrypto_> at least, on one i have in front of me
[02:10:29] <helpcrypto_> maybe the SP?
[02:17:40] <red> nodex: sent the input fields as window.variable = jQuery... and then triggered parent.variable from the iframe
[02:17:43] <red> now it works
[02:17:53] <red> so wasn't changes fault after all
[02:18:56] <NodeX> .. iframe != document .. perhaps mention that lol
[02:19:23] <red> it was a modal window opened by a 3rd party module in Drupal, I was expecting it to be a regular modal heh :)
[02:19:34] <red> dunno why they chose to use shitFrames
[02:19:52] <red> shoulda peeked into dom
[02:20:27] <NodeX> drupal :(
[02:23:10] <red> nuttin' wrong with Drupal, just some Modules ain't up to standards sometimes
[02:23:20] <red> still easier to hook up to partyl well working ones than start from scartch in most cases
[02:23:52] <seutje> some? heh
[02:24:22] <red> from those modules that are actually worth using, some* :)
[02:24:44] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[02:24:50] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 1 || 2
[02:24:50] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: 1
[02:24:58] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 1 || return
[02:24:59] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: SyntaxError: syntax error
[02:25:02] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[02:25:03] <aaronmcadam> why
[02:25:21] <red> not a big surprise tho, Core moves forward a lot, sparetime module devs can't keep up :)
[02:26:07] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !!return
[02:26:08] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: SyntaxError: syntax error
[02:26:18] <aaronmcadam> ah return must not be falsy or truthy
[02:26:31] <NodeX> [10:23:07] <red> nuttin' wrong with Drupal, just some Modules ain't up to standards sometimes -< it's very bloated and kills php . other than that yer it's fine :P
[02:29:02] <aaronmcadam> ah drupal jesus
[02:33:01] <Manish> hi
[02:33:36] <Manish> the tablesorter works for table column which contain drop down list
[02:33:37] <Manish> ?
[02:35:27] <NodeX> lol just looked at drupal on XHProf .. 46,000 function calls to load one admin page :S
[02:36:35] <Manish> did not get
[02:41:20] <loxs> is it guaranteed that $('.class').first()  will always return the topmost (in the DOM) match?
[02:41:30] <NodeX> yes
[02:41:39] <NodeX> you can use .selector:first too
[02:41:47] <loxs> hmm, neat
[02:41:48] <loxs> thanks
[02:42:00] <NodeX> not much point in having it if it's not gaurunteed !!
[03:12:18] <insertjokehere> im having a bit of a problem with some UI buttons that is doing my head in
[03:12:26] <insertjokehere> im changing some of the options with
[03:12:35] <insertjokehere> $(panel).find(".startStopLink").button("option", "label", 'Stop');
[03:12:35] <insertjokehere> $(panel).find(".startStopLink").button("option", "icons", { primary: null, secondary: 'ui-icon-pause' });
[03:12:48] <insertjokehere> but the button doesnt actually change
[03:13:52] <insertjokehere> http://pastebin.com/yfW4rybU
[03:13:56] <insertjokehere> ^^ button html
[03:14:36] <insertjokehere> jquery 1.6.4, jquery-ui 1.8.16, firefox 8 beta (havent checked other browsers)
[03:15:22] <insertjokehere> any thourghts?
[03:15:34] <Udders> Hi everyone, I was wondering if someone would be able to cast an eye over my plugin - having some issues.
[03:19:42] <NodeX> Udders : just ask the question :)
[03:19:54] <insertjokehere> problem also occurs in latest chrome (15.0.874.58)
[03:20:45] <NodeX> insertjokehere: that's not really a question lol
[03:21:00] <insertjokehere> ok, rephrase
[03:21:21] <insertjokehere> does anyone have any idea why my calls to .button('option',...) are having no effect?
[03:22:02] <NodeX> perhaps it cant find the button ?
[03:22:05] <raven_> we need to take a look at your code in order to be able to help you
[03:23:03] <insertjokehere> http://pastebin.com/VYEmHreA
[03:23:06] <NodeX> also from looking at the UI docs $( ".selector" ).button( "option", "text", false );
[03:23:13] <NodeX> text != label
[03:23:53] <insertjokehere> ^^ switch statement at ~line 100
[03:24:18] <insertjokehere> onUpdate is bound as an event handler, triggered every ~second
[03:24:25] <NodeX> are you sure that "panel" is an object at that point
[03:24:43] <insertjokehere> yeah, just checked
[03:24:49] <insertjokehere> $(panel).find(".startStopLink")
[03:24:54] <insertjokehere> refers to the correct node
[03:24:54] <NodeX> the docs say that it's "option", "text" not "option", "label"
[03:25:36] <NodeX> I don't use jquery UI so they could be new docs and you could be on an older version
[03:26:09] <insertjokehere> text controls if the button shows any text, label controls what text is shown
[03:26:15] <insertjokehere> which is what i want
[03:26:20] <insertjokehere> http://scramdownloader.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/scramdownloader/Branches/ui-v3/
[03:26:29] <biscazziere> Hi, I have a simple question: http://pastie.org/2636922 how can I call the getNode function of the _Picker object? This solution doesn't seem to work
[03:26:30] <insertjokehere> ^^ full source if anyone is interested
[03:27:02] <NodeX> make sure it's found the correct button too
[03:27:20] <NodeX> and make sure it's in the correct switch
[03:27:27] <NodeX> the code looks valid
[03:27:28] <diverdude> Is it possible to make the autocomplete plugin (http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete) show results in a dropdownbox before starting to type? The problem with this control is its usability. No users know what to write in the box if the cannot see any options beforehand
[03:27:45] <diverdude> basically to make it work like this: http://simpletutorials.com/?path=tutorials/javascript/jquery/ddcombobox
[03:30:23] <diverdude> anyone?
[03:30:29] <Woet> diverdude: read the docs
[03:30:38] <diverdude> Woet, so it is possible?
[03:30:44] <Woet> sure
[03:30:48] <Woet> if you read the docs :)
[03:31:03] <NodeX> I would imagine you can just open the select box or w/e on keydown
[03:31:16] <diverdude> NodeX, no, not possible
[03:31:22] <diverdude> NodeX, its not a select box
[03:31:32] <diverdude> its jjust a textfield...thats the problem
[03:31:39] <Woet> it's not a problem if you read the docs
[03:33:10] <diverdude> Woet, hmm are you sure? I have read the docs here: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete and they dont say anything about how to show the list without typing anything
[03:33:23] <insertjokehere> diverdude: hint: options tab
[03:34:22] <Woet> there is a better place insertjokehere
[03:34:30] <Woet> diverdude: hint: methods tab
[03:34:39] <diverdude> hmmm
[03:35:09] <insertjokehere> or that
[03:35:23] <Woet> diverdude: there are only 8 methods, so i'm sure you can find it :)
[03:36:00] <diverdude> Woet, are you talking about the search method?
[03:36:19] <Woet> it should help, yes
[03:37:23] <diverdude> Woet, hmm when should it be called?
[03:38:04] <Woet> diverdude: "before starting to type"
[03:38:09] <Woet> quoting yourself :p
[03:40:32] <diverdude> Woet, so i do $( "#languages" ).autocomplete({source: availableTags}); to bind the data, so i could do: $( "#languages" ).autocomplete({source: availableTags}).search(function(){/*What happens here?*/}); ?
[03:40:44] <Woet> that's not how you use the search method
[03:40:47] <Woet> read the docs again
[03:40:51] <Woet> :)
[03:40:56] <Udders> can someone take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/9f8Y2/ for me, it is my new plugin, however it is adding the options incorrectly - take a look and you will understand what I mean
[03:41:33] <diverdude> Woet, docs dont say how its used, only what its used for : http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete/search
[03:41:52] <johnline3> hi woet
[03:42:04] <Woet> hi johnline3
[03:42:05] <Woet> how are you
[03:42:14] <johnline3> dandy
[03:42:44] <Woet> diverdude: did you look at the docs of the autocomplete plugin?
[03:42:58] <Woet> diverdude: "Note (2010-06-23): This plugin is deprecated and not developed anymore. Its successor is part of jQuery UI, and this migration guide explains how to get from this plugin to the new one. "
[03:43:00] <diverdude> Woet, yes, its this: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete/search
[03:43:01] <Woet> johnline3: i'm happy for you
[03:43:35] <diverdude> Woet, where did you get that from?
[03:43:52] <Udders> Will any one help a stuck developer?
[03:44:06] <NodeX> Udders : can you be a bit more specifix
[03:44:10] <NodeX> it's a little vague
[03:44:15] <Woet> diverdude: from the official plugin page the jquery docs link to
[03:44:30] <Woet> diverdude: anyways, the docs at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete/search have an examples tab
[03:45:11] <Udders> http://jsfiddle.net/9f8Y2/ I am making a plugin that create pretty select lists, everything works fine until there are 2 selects on the page, and then the options get sent to the wrong selects. See my jsFiddle for an example
[03:45:20] <diverdude> Woet, ehh that pages dont say anything about being deprecated
[03:45:36] <NodeX> it's probably the parent().parent() call
[03:45:57] <Udders> But that is only placing the new dropdowns in the correct place in the DOM
[03:46:02] <Woet> diverdude: you do know you are mixing up two docs right?
[03:46:10] <Woet> [12:33:10] <diverdude> Woet, hmm are you sure? I have read the docs here: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete
[03:46:11] <Woet> [12:41:33] <diverdude> Woet, docs dont say how its used, only what its used for : http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete/search
[03:46:14] <Woet> two different plugins
[03:46:34] <Woet> both docs have the proper documentation though
[03:48:19] <diverdude> how very confusing
[03:48:27] <diverdude> they look exactly the same
[03:48:57] <Woet> diverdude: are you using jquery UI?
[03:49:05] <diverdude> Woet, yes
[03:49:13] <Woet> diverdude: then use the jquery UI docs to avoid such issues
[03:49:16] <Woet> diverdude: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[03:49:28] <waseem_> I am trying to do a $('#blog_content_1').load('data/blog.html', function (html) { console.log(html) }). My console.log logs the html returned from the load call. But my #blog_content_1 is not filled with that html content. What could be wrong?
[03:50:00] <Woet> ?demo @ waseem_
[03:50:00] <bot-t> waseem_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:50:23] <diverdude> Woet, ahhh yes ok...there is an explanation of how to use it. I need to supply my own button :)
[03:50:35] <waseem_> Woet: Should some gists/pasties will be helpful for you?
[03:50:42] <Woet> diverdude: what?!
[03:50:49] <waseem_> s/Should/Would/
[03:50:55] <Woet> waseem_: link to actual site is best, jsfiddle would be the only other option
[03:51:00] <Woet> pasties suck
[03:51:17] <waseem_> hmmm okay let me try.
[03:51:19] <Udders> http://jsfiddle.net/9f8Y2/ I am making a plugin that create pretty select lists, everything works fine until there are 2 selects on the page, and then the options get sent to the wrong selects. See my jsFiddle for an example
[03:51:52] <diverdude> Woet, "can be used by a selectbox-like button to open the suggestions when clicked"
[03:52:21] <Woet> diverdude: oh, right, sure
[03:52:46] <Woet> diverdude: i already made a jsfiddle some time ago - http://jsfiddle.net/Jqqz9/
[03:52:52] <insertjokehere> does jquery keep track of nodes that have been .clone()ed?
[03:53:30] <insertjokehere> eg, if i have a button that was .clone()ed, and im changing options on the clone, any reason why those changes would be reflected on the original?
[03:53:59] <NodeX> probably depends when it was cloned
[03:54:25] <NodeX> I imagine clone() takes a snapshot of an object not monitor it
[03:54:37] <insertjokehere> thats what i thourght
[03:54:56] <insertjokehere> so something odd is going on then
[03:55:54] <diverdude> Woet, cool, thx

[04:06:31] <BlaDe^> I have like   $(headlines).each(function(i, val) { console.log(val[0]); }  --- which is giving Object [ title:"string", link:"string", date:"string" ]
[04:06:38] <BlaDe^> but I can't acces them via val[0].title  etc, why?
[04:08:10] <xec> BlaDe^: you should... maybe try val[0]["title"]
[04:08:23] <BlaDe^> xec: that gives undefined
[04:09:01] <BlaDe^> it shows [ Object ] not just Object... could that be why?
[04:09:43] <BlaDe^> Yeah, I had an extra set of [ ] .. damn
[04:09:55] <xec> :)
[04:10:16] <BlaDe^> ok.. so I have this array of headlines, I want to .fadeIn and .fadeOut one every 10 seconds in a span
[04:10:19] <BlaDe^> what's the best way to do it?
[04:10:58] <xec> what do you mean, you want to fade in and out a header which is already in a span?
[04:11:09] <BlaDe^> well... I have an array of headlines fmor our blog
[04:11:16] <BlaDe^> I just want to display them at the top of the page, one at a time...
[04:12:20] <BlaDe^> so I was thinking like $('#headline').innerHTML($('<a />').attr('href', headline.link).text(headline.title);
[04:12:45] <BlaDe^> and to .fadeOut/.fadeIn a new one every 10 seconds but I wasn't sure on the best way to change them every 10 seconds
[04:13:21] <xec> like, you have multiple headlines, only want to display 1 at a time, and fade between
[04:13:24] <BlaDe^> yes
[04:14:37] <xec> i'm not sure how best to do that, either :D
[04:15:07] <insertjokehere> ok, i think this is a bug
[04:15:44] <insertjokehere> somewhere along the line, the object that im invoking .button on is being replaced by another object
[04:16:38] <seutje> var hollaback = function() {$(this).animate({opacity: 0}).next().animate({opacity: 1}); }; $('.headline').css({opacity:0}).animate({opacity: 1},  hollaback);
[04:16:55] <seutje> could prolly get the duplicate shit outta there and turn it into a plugin or something
[04:17:20] <seutje> actually, might as well just use something like cycle
[04:18:51] <louigi> hey guys! have a problem with changing css attributes. i have a table. with jquery i change borders of td to 0px, all fine. then, later in the program i change background color of this td and borders return.
[04:19:14] <louigi> what can be done to change background color and yet leave previous changes made with jquery intact?
[04:19:34] <BlaDe^> xec:  I tried this: http://pastie.org/private/gopw7ynwrqttd6zt3wnssa
[04:19:49] <BlaDe^> looks like thoes vars are out of scope in the closure?
[04:19:59] <seutje> insertjokehere: not experiencing this issue you described: http://jsfiddle.net/4BX2L/
[04:20:23] <xec> doesnt look like your code does exactly what he wanted, seutje http://jsfiddle.net/PwwYa/
[04:20:50] <insertjokehere> seutje: yeah, there is a lot going on, im not sure exactly what is going on
[04:20:56] <insertjokehere> ill try and explain
[04:21:12] <insertjokehere> ive got a <div> with a load of stuff in it (including this button)
[04:21:44] <insertjokehere> updateUI is called by a setTimeout, and it makes an ajax call
[04:22:12] <insertjokehere> the success function from that call finds this div, clones it, and binds an event hander to it
[04:22:29] <insertjokehere> that event handler is now triggered every time updateUI is called (about once a second)
[04:22:41] <seutje> xec: forgot some crap, obviously, this one won't loop endlessly: http://jsfiddle.net/PwwYa/1/
[04:23:12] <insertjokehere> that event handler (among other things), makes the changes to the button
[04:23:26] <xec> ah, yeah
[04:23:40] <insertjokehere> does anyone happen to have visual studio 2010 (express should do), subversion, and enough can-be-bothered to look at the code?
[04:28:51] <louigi> guys. so if i make one change to css attribute and then make another - the previous one will revert back to the original css?
[04:33:02] <insertjokehere> for anyone who still cares: http://jsfiddle.net/7U8Pm/
[04:33:18] <insertjokehere> second button should change label, but it doesnt
[04:34:16] <norbert_> hi all, I'm looking into the autocomplete of jquery-ui and I want to use thousands of these autocomplete input fields on a single page; now I'm wondering, is there another way than to create $("#name").autocomplete ({ LOTS_OF_STUFF }) for each of these fields?
[04:35:07] <insertjokehere> from some poking around in the code, it appears that the cloned button still has data pointing at the old button, which causes some odd behavior
[04:39:35] <dabear> norbert_: thousands? what's the use case for that? :/
[04:39:47] <xec> BlaDe^: check it! http://jsfiddle.net/PwwYa/2/
[04:39:56] <dabear> norbert_: you can select all elements in one selector, then use autocomplete()
[04:39:56] <BlaDe^> xec:  i got it working now ;)
[04:40:02] <xec> hehehe
[04:40:11] <BlaDe^> yours maybe looks  a bit nicer lol
[04:40:21] <insertjokehere> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/7VCBa/
[04:40:33] <norbert_> dabear: sorry, I don't understand what you mean by "select all elements in one selector"
[04:40:42] <BlaDe^> thanks xec :)
[04:41:09] <Trisox> insertjokehere: jsfiddle.net/Trisox/7U8Pm/3/
[04:41:10] <dabear> norbert_: $("#name, #yourmom, #email, #yourdog").autocomplete()
[04:41:13] <xec> BlaDe^: i'm not sure if this is the best approach, like seutje said there's some redundant code
[04:42:03] <norbert_> dabear: myeah, but they each have one variable that differs :|
[04:42:25] <insertjokehere> Trisox: interesting, probably not the intended behavior though
[04:42:28] <seutje> I like how u kept it "hollaback", please use that in production :P
[04:42:31] <BlaDe^> xec: http://pastie.org/private/yjz7yxcurr3morokvwvrg
[04:42:32] <BlaDe^> my solution
[04:42:36] <Trisox> wy not ..
[04:42:37] <dabear> norbert_: if you need hundreds of autocompletes in a page, your doing something wrong
[04:42:57] <Trisox> its whats between <button> and </button>
[04:43:04] <Trisox> it copies the text...
[04:43:08] <Trisox> like you tell it to
[04:43:20] <Trisox> so with text you set it to what you need it to be .. bar
[04:43:26] <Trisox> totaly expected
[04:43:35] <insertjokehere> yes, but not the point
[04:43:46] <Trisox> ?
[04:43:49] <Trisox> make your point then
[04:43:54] <insertjokehere> if i .clone a button, i should be able to still use the .button method on that button
[04:45:14] <insertjokehere> eg, set icons and such
[04:45:36] <seutje> insertjokehere: please read the documentation on jquery UI button
[04:45:53] <seutje> the way u tried to change the label only works *after* init
[04:46:00] <Trisox> mm
[04:46:00] <seutje> if u want to pass it along during init: http://jsfiddle.net/7U8Pm/4/
[04:46:11] <Trisox> indeed
[04:46:16] <Trisox> like i did with text..
[04:46:25] <seutje> also, no need to re-evaluate $('#bar'), it's already being returned by the previous call
[04:46:54] <insertjokehere> #bar and #baz are already init-ed though, when they were known as foo
[04:47:26] <insertjokehere> or am i missing something...
[04:47:33] <seutje> only foo was initialized, then cloned, guess it's no longer a button instance then
[04:47:58] <seutje> I guess u don't need to re-evaluate $('#foo') either http://jsfiddle.net/7U8Pm/5/
[04:48:31] <insertjokehere> hmm.
[04:48:48] <insertjokehere> thanks guys, better get some sleep. 1 am is coming up fast
[04:49:12] <seutje> actually, maybe better to clone before turning it into a button
[04:49:19] <Trisox> http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/ check option > label ;)
[04:51:22] <seutje> sorta like this http://jsfiddle.net/7U8Pm/6/
[04:58:58] <diverdude> Woet, do you know if there is a maxium height to put on the autocomplete plugin....i have almost 100 rows...i only want to show maybe 10 and then a scrollbare
[05:00:07] <ablomen> diverdude, the css max-height property?
[05:00:36] <diverdude> ablomen, set on what element?
[05:01:00] <ablomen> firebug should be able to tell you that
[05:01:45] <diverdude> ablomen, hmmm i dont think its that easy

[05:14:00] <timing> rgr: no it won;t automatically detach it

[05:32:10] <kapowaz> don't do that

[05:34:00] <reasy> hi kapowaz, im using ajax to get the data from a database, the properties have been set, i can see this using an alert, but cant get the box to appear checked.
[05:34:27] <reasy> ive tried .button("refresh") and about everything else i can think of
[05:35:47] <kapowaz> oh I see, you mean it's not actually updating the fact that it's been checked?
[05:35:56] <reasy> yes
[05:35:59] <kapowaz> paste your javascript into jsfiddle or something
[05:36:21] <NodeX> $("the-radio-button").prop("checked",true);
[05:36:26] <NodeX> in jq 1.6+
[05:37:53] <reasy> im using 1.6+ and am using $("the-radio-button").prop("checked",true); the property is being set, but radiobox does not appear checked?
[05:38:49] <NodeX> you have some bad markup then
[05:42:35] <diverdude> I am using the autocomplete plugin where i have bound $('#myautobox').blur(close expand-box). I have done this so that the user can close the expand-box by clicking elsewhere on the page. This works great, however the only problem is that when user clicks an option in the expanded box, a blur() of course also occurs and the box is closed so that nothing can be selected. How can i solve this problem?
[05:44:05] <Udders> Can any one help me figure out a problem with my plugin?
[05:47:22] <Udders> can any one help me figure out a problem with my plugin?

I can't figure out how to force these through? would really appreciate any pointers!
[06:22:36] <timing> jc___: get the non minimized jquery and comment that try catch
[06:22:40] <timing> that's what I do
[06:23:59] <DThought> jc___, timing: just for the big picture: why do you have js errors in that code, that need to be caught?
[06:24:19] <ShawnRisk> did people see my question?
[06:25:49] <jc___> DThought: you can't even catch them when debugging the web app - I'd rather see JS errors filtering through than them getting swallowed and lost

[06:41:34] <OssianGrr> i am doing an experiment with html5 drag-drop. wondering how i should do this with jquery.  if i bind my drop event with document.addEventListener, it works fine. if i try to use jquery ".bind", then i get "e.dataTransfer is undefined".
[06:43:28] <OssianGrr> the drop function is the same in both cases.. stoppropagation, preventdefault, then attempt to look at e.dataTransfer.files
[06:43:38] <johnkpaul> is this in IE?

[06:44:40] <OssianGrr> it's fine if i have to stick with straight javascript, just wondering if there was some twist i was missing
[06:46:48] <blackspotwiggins> OssianGrr, when you use jquery, you need to use e.originalEvent.dataTransfer
[06:47:36] <OssianGrr> aha, I will try that

[06:50:20] <reasy> hi, i was here earlier with a problem relating to radio boxes
[06:50:38] <reasy> the properties for checked were set, yet the radio box did not appear as checked.
[06:50:46] <ShawnRisk> timing: that is what it does now.  Do you see the <a></a>  that is suppose to be a slide out drop down menu.  With this appear below the li.
[06:50:51] <reasy> when i remove the following code from the page: 	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js"></script>
[06:51:10] <reasy> the radio buttons work how they should! any ideas?
[07:08:02] <aro> anyone had any luck using cors with IE and jquery 1.6.3?
[07:11:30] <PhanLord> is it possible to get additional headers returned when image was downloaded, somehow ?
[07:14:57] <loxs> seems like if I do several times $('.class').click(function), then that function gets executed several times on click.  OMG! how can I prevent that?
[07:16:28] <PhanLord> loxs do .each(.....{ val.onclick = function() {} } }  (if you have multiple elements otherwise $('.click')[0].onclick
[07:16:37] <PhanLord> had same issue
[07:17:21] <warrenparsons> Jebus, don't use onclick(). Bind all your event handlers on that element one time.
[07:20:18] <aaronmcadam> don't use each either
[07:20:21] <aaronmcadam> use $.delegate
[07:20:31] <aaronmcadam> see ?delegate
[07:20:31] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:21:00] <aaronmcadam> can't wait to use .on() though
[07:21:18] <kborchers> on and off look sweet :)
[07:21:21] <aaronmcadam> yeaaa
[07:21:26] <aaronmcadam> nice unified api too
[07:21:28] <logik-bomb> what's that?
[07:21:34] <aaronmcadam> ah man keep up :P
[07:21:40] <aaronmcadam> jquery.com/blog
[07:21:42] <logik-bomb> thanks
[07:21:57] <aro> anyone had any luck using cors with IE and jquery 1.6.3?
[07:22:12] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:22:22] <aaronmcadam> could just use a proxy instead
[07:22:23] <warrenparsons> Wondering if there's a plan to bring the .one() method under the .on() umbrella
[07:22:24] <aaronmcadam> or YQL
[07:22:31] <aro> proxy?
[07:22:32] <aro> how so
[07:22:35] <aaronmcadam> ah good point warrenparsons
[07:22:45] <aaronmcadam> cors is a sop workaround right?
[07:23:07] <aaronmcadam> i've never actually used .one() tho warrenparsons
[07:24:17] <warrenparsons> @aaronmcadam I just remembered it a few minutes ago when I was thinking of setting a flag to only execute a function the first time an event fired.
[07:24:28] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:24:39] <aaronmcadam> just never had the need for that
[07:24:41] <erichynds> warrenparsons: you could also just unbind/die/undelegate in the handler
[07:24:48] <aaronmcadam> true
[07:24:52] <warrenparsons> Hmm, good point.
[07:24:53] <aaronmcadam> or off()
[07:24:56] <warrenparsons> Ha!
[07:24:58] <aaronmcadam> in this instance
[07:25:32] <aro> im trying to build a subsitute wrapper for XDR
[07:25:46] <aaronmcadam> hopefully with the new api I won't have to constantly explain $.delegate to people
[07:26:43] <warrenparsons> @erichynds Works perfectly. Thanks for the lateral thinking.
[07:27:26] <aaronmcadam> just one of those things
[07:27:48] <aaronmcadam> using the sugar all the time :D
[07:28:25] <justinhjohnson> what is $.delegate?
[07:28:27] <aaronmcadam> It's most certainly doing unbind internally anyway
[07:28:28] <justinhjohnson> ;p
[07:28:34] <aaronmcadam> cheeky pup :p
[07:28:34] <justinhjohnson> too soon?
[07:28:41] <aaronmcadam> ?nuke
[07:28:42] <bot-t> ** Nuclear Launch Detected **
[07:31:03] <loxs> aaronmcadam, if I delegate twice, it gets executed twice, so that doesn't solve my problem
[07:31:44] <kborchers> loxs: why the hell are you delegating twice? see ?demo
[07:31:45] <bot-t> loxs, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:32:04] <loxs> kborchers, because I want to
[07:33:33] <loxs> seems like the only real solution is the one proposed by PhanLord
[07:33:50] <loxs> thanks for it
[07:34:52] <inad922> Anyone knows an image slider script over jquery which is simple(!) ? I would like to understand how it works
[07:39:15] <Techdeck> Anyone knows how the hell did google do that web installer in http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gappssync -- ? how can you do that without a 'download'?
[07:40:41] <NodeX> it says quite clearly "Download google app sync" lol
[07:41:14] <Techdeck> NodeX, but how the hell do they install it without you actually downloading the file?
[07:41:20] <Techdeck> click on it with chrome or firefox
[07:42:19] <Elephant> idk, chrome warns me about an exe.
[07:42:26] <Elephant> which could be lethan to my machine.
[07:42:33] <Elephant> lethal even
[07:42:41] <NodeX> me too
[07:42:46] <NodeX> FF doesn't worryingly
[07:42:55] <Techdeck> are you on linux?
[07:43:08] <Techdeck> if so, you don't count :P
[07:43:24] <NodeX> no ... they have an Apps hook in firefox meaning that Mozilla have signed it to be able to play in the sandbox
[07:43:38] <Techdeck> ahh, so it can only be done by them?
[07:43:48] <NodeX> yup
[07:43:57] <Techdeck> where did you get this info?
[07:44:00] <NodeX> they propbably paid ALOT of money for it
[07:44:18] <NodeX> it's on the mozilla site somewhere I remember reading few months ago
[07:44:34] <Elephant> wow that is scary
[07:44:37] <Techdeck> got it, thank you!
[07:44:39] <Elephant> pops a UAC in ff.
[07:46:59] <ryan_sp> if I have a container with a div on the left and a div on the right, can I get the width between them somehow ?
[07:49:24] <ShawnRisk> the drop down menu is closing oddly, not sure how to create: http://jsfiddle.net/CAj3P/3/  Look at the first menu item.  Any ideas on how to fix?
[07:51:14] <Gho5t> Is anyone aware of a callback for when the subgrid loads in jqgrid?
[07:55:09] <|RicharD|> hi
[07:55:24] <|RicharD|> there is any method for do these in easyway ?http://web.enavu.com/demos/thumbnailZoom/
[07:55:33] <|RicharD|> (i want only show the name...no zoom effect)
[07:55:39] <aaronmcadam> does anyone know if you can use data-* attrs to use $.data when the page isn't HTML5?
[07:56:53] <warrenparsons> @aaron, yes you can
[07:56:55] <ablomen> aaronmcadam, works fine with (x)html < 5, though i'm not sure about ie6 (but who cares about that beast anyway)
[07:57:05] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:57:07] <aaronmcadam> cheers lads
[07:57:11] <aaronmcadam> trying it now
[07:57:49] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help
[08:03:04] <ace__> does the cross site javascript rule go both ways? for example if the iframe is being loaded into my page, can my page communicate with the iframes content? I know the reverse isnt possible, but it is both ways?
[08:03:57] <diverdude> hey. is it possible to use key=>value pairs in the jquery autocomplete somehow? http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete ?
[08:07:56] <Gho5t> Is anyone aware of a callback for when the subgrid loads in jqgrid?
[08:09:58] <diverdude> Woet, hey mate, are you there?
[08:17:40] <aro> is there a way to make IE work cross domain with ajax?
[08:18:41] <logik-bomb> jsonp?
[08:18:44] <Oleander> im new to jquery and im working on autcomplete search. Is it better to return html or to iterate through json and format it?
[08:18:52] <aro> is that the only way?
[08:19:00] <Hooloovoo> Oleander: json
[08:19:14] <tgodar> aro: proxy server
[08:19:29] <mbtez> how do you troubleshoot a jquery .click(function(event){ thing
[08:19:33] <Hooloovoo> Oleander: actually, i can't think of a single case where you'd like to have html instead of json.
[08:19:40] <mbtez> with firebug
[08:19:40] <aro> the point of this is to directly 'ping' several servers to find out which one has the best response
[08:19:41] <Oleander> Hoolovoo: right ok
[08:20:03] <aro> so i am not sure if proxy would be best
[08:20:09] <Oleander> Hooloovoo: so i can overwrite to default list items for the jquery ui widget?
[08:20:09] <tgodar> aro: make call server side?  then not an issue?  or is it time from client's machine?
[08:20:12] <aaronmcadam> hmm doesn't seem to work
[08:20:19] <aro> time from clients machine
[08:21:38] <jeffsmykil> how do i say if ($(".foo").hasNoContent();)
[08:21:55] <aaronmcadam> .children().length
[08:21:56] <aro> length?
[08:22:09] <jeffsmykil> ty
[08:22:23] <aaronmcadam> if ( !$(bla).children.length ) {}
[08:22:26] <tgodar> aro: maybe some iframes?  was thinking about ways to load say an image from multiple sites and then measure the time to load... not sure how that would work though
[08:22:36] <mbtez> what about innerHTML?
[08:23:09] <aaronmcadam> also see ?contents @ jeffsmykil
[08:23:10] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[08:23:34] <aro> what is jsonp
[08:23:43] <aaronmcadam> ?g jsonp @ aro
[08:23:45] <bot-t> aro, JSONP - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[08:29:21] <aaronmcadam> argh
[08:29:32] <aaronmcadam> fiddle works but my setup doesn't hmmm
[08:29:45] <aro> can you post with jsonp?
[08:29:52] <warrenparsons> "Breaks on my local..."?
[08:30:03] <aro> or is it get only
[08:31:07] <webdev5> how do you get the id of the parent?
[08:31:41] <aro> $('element').parent().attr('id');
[08:31:47] <webdev5> thank you aro
[08:31:50] <aro> yw
[08:37:49] <Snausages> I was looking for the tooltip docu, but all the links I've seen point to http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tooltip which is a redirect to a deleted page, should I be looking elsewhere?
[08:37:57] <lduros> hello, i'm changing the width() and height() of images relative to their original size. It uses width() and height() to get the original size, and then sets these values again. However, if the actual parent of the image is set as display: none;, then the width() and height() values of these images is 0. Is there any way to prevent that other than having them being displayed?
[08:38:41] <veera> Hello. How do i manually trigger an onchange event with jquery?
[08:40:43] <jedimind_> .trigger('onchange')
[08:40:50] <jedimind_> its literally the way you said it
[08:41:05] <kborchers> i love when the question is the answer
[08:41:16] <veera> jedimind_: Thank you
[08:51:00] <Tatsh> IE7 issue: var value = $(this).val(); where $(this) is a checkbox
[08:51:07] <Tatsh> it returns 'on' instead of what's in the value attribute
[08:51:14] <Tatsh> same goes for prop and attr
[08:51:54] <timing> Tatsh: how did the value attribute change?
[08:52:00] <Tatsh> i have no idea
[08:52:11] <timing> Tatsh: by the user or by prop() or val() ?
[08:52:31] <Tatsh> when i made the checkbox the attribute value was assigned with val()
[08:52:49] <Tatsh> it says 'on', i'm expecting '25_30'
[08:52:52] <Tatsh> and this only happens in IE7
[08:54:01] <Tatsh> actually i did assign with attr('value' instead
[08:54:07] <Tatsh> let me see if val() makes it work
[08:54:50] <Tatsh> i always wonder 'should we consider IE's strictness a good thing?'
[08:59:24] <diverdude> I am using the autocomplete plugin where i have bound $('#myautobox').blur(close expand-box). I have done this so that the user can close the expand-box by clicking elsewhere on the page. This works great, however the only problem is that when user clicks an option in the expanded box, a blur() of course also occurs and the box is closed so that nothing can be selected. How can i solve this problem?
[08:59:45] <diverdude> whoops
[08:59:46] <diverdude> :)
[08:59:49] <ccmonster> ?
[08:59:50] <diverdude> nevermind
[09:00:11] <diverdude> ccmonster, ever used the autocomple plugin?
[09:00:46] <ScottO_> how would i check to see if html ajax content has a hidden form field?
[09:01:14] <ScottO_> can i run selectors on html thats in a variable?
[09:01:26] <BinaryKitten> $(content).find('input[name=blah]').length > 0
[09:01:27] <ccmonster> I have.
[09:01:33] <BinaryKitten> @ Scott0
[09:01:33] <ccmonster> it's been a while though.
[09:01:42] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: sweet
[09:01:45] <ScottO_> thx
[09:01:58] <BinaryKitten> not the most efficient though
[09:02:10] <ccmonster> them's the breaks :|
[09:02:17] <BinaryKitten> diverdude
[09:02:28] <diverdude> BinaryKitten, yeah?
[09:02:31] <BinaryKitten> check to see if the event target contains the item
[09:03:02] <diverdude> BinaryKitten, where do i put that?
[09:03:20] <BinaryKitten> instead of using blur
[09:03:26] <BinaryKitten> try the focusout
[09:03:33] <BinaryKitten> ?focusout @ diverdude
[09:03:34] <bot-t> diverdude, .focusout(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focusout" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/focusout/
[09:04:14] <diverdude> BinaryKitten, ahh ok
[09:04:18] <biscazziere> Hi, I'm trying to write a jquery plugin adding a function to jQuery. I'd like it to be like the $.ajax() method. I'm working on this: http://pastie.org/2638495
[09:04:27] <oojacoboo> if I have an html element <li> in a list and I really need the <li> to be replaced in a load()
[09:04:33] <oojacoboo> what's the best way to go about this?
[09:04:52] <diverdude> BinaryKitten, do you also know how to use key=>value pair with the autocomplete plugin?
[09:04:52] <BinaryKitten> don't use load oojacoboo
[09:04:56] <biscazziere> but I get the error on calling this.tryGet(selector); because this referers to jquery object apparently
[09:04:58] <oojacoboo> BinaryKitten: use what then?
[09:05:24] <BinaryKitten> use $.get and $(targetLi).replacewith(content) from the complete/success
[09:05:25] <biscazziere> I'd like to call $.smartSelector(string) and then perform my logic in "private"  methods
[09:05:38] <oojacoboo> BinaryKitten: yea...
[09:05:38] <BinaryKitten> load is a nice helper method that deals with things automagically
[09:05:56] <BinaryKitten> but if you want to do more, go to the lower level api
[09:06:07] <oojacoboo> BinaryKitten: gotcha, thanks
[09:06:11] <BinaryKitten> $.get/$.post  tehn on to the $.ajax etc
[09:06:12] <BinaryKitten> :)
[09:06:19] <oojacoboo> yep
[09:06:28] <diverdude> BinaryKitten, do you also know how to use key=>value pair with the autocomplete plugin
[09:06:36] <oojacoboo> BinaryKitten: can you just use ajax and store the success as a function?
[09:06:47] <BinaryKitten> urm nope not without context diverdude please create a pastebin
[09:06:54] <BinaryKitten> urmm sort of
[09:07:05] <BinaryKitten> you get a callback on success
[09:07:06] <zoned> does anyone know if its possible to stack transparent PNG's on top of one another to build a progressive image? and how do you go about doing that? make them the background image of a div and set opacity and z-index?
[09:07:28] <BinaryKitten> $.get is better oojacoboo unless you need more config options
[09:07:40] <oojacoboo> BinaryKitten: I need to specify the dataType
[09:07:52] <BinaryKitten> you can do that with .get
[09:07:58] <oojacoboo> I'm using a proxy to get around XSS and it's setup to default to xml from what I see
[09:08:07] <BinaryKitten> $.get(location, data, fnCallback, type)
[09:08:24] <oojacoboo> BinaryKitten: then just set that as a var?
[09:08:52] <BinaryKitten> $.get(location, data, function(content) { $(targetLI).replaceWith(content); } type)
[09:08:54] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: its not finding the hidden field in the html, but when i run the .find on the lement that the hiddenf ield gets added to, i get a value of 1
[09:09:20] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: any idea why it wouldn't work on html that is in a variable?
[09:09:21] <oojacoboo> BinaryKitten: thanks :)
[09:09:31] <BinaryKitten> what's the selector you use to find the hidden input later
[09:09:40] <BinaryKitten> and what are you using to inject the html Scott0?
[09:09:51] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: im using find('input[type="hidden"]').length
[09:10:02] <BinaryKitten> biscazziere sorry, will be with you shortly
[09:10:09] <BinaryKitten> drop the "
[09:10:15] <biscazziere> BinaryKitten: thank you
[09:10:15] <BinaryKitten> don't need the quotes
[09:10:18] <ScottO_> i do
[09:10:25] <BinaryKitten> no you don't
[09:10:31] <ScottO_> special situation
[09:10:38] <BinaryKitten> explain?
[09:10:38] <ScottO_> im telling you, i do
[09:10:42] <ScottO_> lol
[09:10:52] <ScottO_> promise not to blast me?
[09:10:57] <BinaryKitten> sure
[09:11:12] <ScottO_> i run it through php first
[09:11:28] <BinaryKitten> and?
[09:11:41] <ScottO_> wait.. maybe im thinking of another thing
[09:11:54] <BinaryKitten> probably are :p
[09:12:04] <ScottO_> when using [id="blah"] its always been required
[09:12:14] <BinaryKitten> is it?
[09:12:23] <ScottO_> been doing this for a while
[09:12:30] <ScottO_> ill try without
[09:12:31] <BinaryKitten> same here :)
[09:12:53] <ScottO_> with the doublequotes it works in the console
[09:13:04] <BinaryKitten> ok..
[09:13:09] <ScottO_> is that whats causing it not to work? or you just noticed it
[09:13:18] <BinaryKitten> don't know
[09:13:30] <BinaryKitten> just wanted to make sure you're using the same selector on both sides
[09:13:50] <ScottO_> i was
[09:13:58] <BinaryKitten> biscazziere can you re-link me to teh paste bin please and outline of the issue?
[09:14:15] <biscazziere> BinaryKitten: sure, here you are: http://pastie.org/2638495
[09:14:16] <BinaryKitten> ScottO_ can you pastebin your code so i might see it please?
[09:14:28] <ScottO_> kinda hard to isolate
[09:14:30] <biscazziere> BinaryKitten: I'm trying to write a plugin in the form of $.ajax()
[09:14:35] <ScottO_> ill try if i cant  get it working
[09:14:46] <BinaryKitten> ok so directly off of jquery biscazziere ?
[09:14:47] <biscazziere> I don't need my function to be callable on a collection of jquery objects
[09:15:21] <biscazziere> BinaryKitten: I think so, I'd like it to be callable like $.smartSelector('a string');
[09:15:43] <BinaryKitten> ok
[09:16:09] <biscazziere> BinaryKitten: I've found plugin pattern for plugins which work like $('elem').myPlugin(), but it's not my situation I think

[09:24:44] <snover> how to display a single error message in form validations
[09:24:57] <BinaryKitten> Scott0 but you're saying that the code may contain a hidden input
[09:25:14] <BinaryKitten> if it does then find will work
[09:25:27] <Brodingo> i accidentally the entire submit event
[09:25:30] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: http://pastebin.com/necUHnJh
[09:25:38] <BinaryKitten> Can haz Awpz! Ceiling Kitty shineyz downz on meh!
[09:25:44] <paul_irish> :)
[09:25:45] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: that returns 0
[09:25:55] <BinaryKitten> yes
[09:26:02] <paul_irish> snover: how do you see chrome14 stats on statcounter
[09:26:05] <BinaryKitten> because it doesn't have a child that is a hidden input
[09:26:07] <paul_irish> http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-201009-201109
[09:26:10] <ScottO_> ah
[09:26:12] <BinaryKitten> ?.is
[09:26:13] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[09:26:24] <ScottO_> im actually tryign to check to see if there is a hidden field somewhere in the html
[09:26:29] <BinaryKitten> right
[09:26:34] <BinaryKitten> then you call that find on the html
[09:26:37] <ScottO_> not necessarily the child
[09:26:42] <snover> paul_irish: http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-daily-20110904-20111003
[09:26:45] <BinaryKitten> it will be a child of the html
[09:26:52] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: i dont want to check it onces its in the page
[09:26:58] <BinaryKitten> no
[09:27:07] <ScottO_> i want to check it before i add the html to the page
[09:27:09] <BinaryKitten> but what are you calling to get the html content ScottO_?
[09:27:16] <paul_irish> :)
[09:27:24] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: ajax
[09:27:30] <BinaryKitten> $.ajax right?
[09:27:33] <ScottO_> yep
[09:27:34] <BinaryKitten> and then in the callback
[09:27:38] <diverdude> BinaryKitten, in this example:http://jsfiddle.net/Jqqz9/1/
[09:27:38] <BinaryKitten> you get what?
[09:27:57] <ScottO_> the html
[09:27:59] <diverdude> BinaryKitten, how do i change it to key value pair data?
[09:27:59] <BinaryKitten> right
[09:28:07] <BinaryKitten> ScottO_  so ..
[09:28:14] <BinaryKitten> $(theHtml).find.........
[09:28:24] <ScottO_> thats obviously what i did
[09:28:32] <BinaryKitten> ok..
[09:28:40] <BinaryKitten> can you pastebin that code please?
[09:28:49] <ScottO_> wait lets backup
[09:29:03] <ScottO_> the problem is that i need it o find a hidden input field in the html returned
[09:29:10] <BinaryKitten> right
[09:29:10] <ScottO_> i pasted the returned html
[09:29:17] <BinaryKitten> so the htmlReturned is a variable
[09:29:26] <ScottO_> yes
[09:29:27] <diverdude> BinaryKitten, ?
[09:29:32] <ScottO_> and i need to search that variable
[09:29:32] <BinaryKitten> pass that to $()
[09:29:43] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: i did
[09:29:52] <BinaryKitten> right
[09:29:58] <ScottO_> what you see in the pastebin is the html in $()
[09:30:00] <BinaryKitten> so please paste the code
[09:30:04] <devinrolsen> Anyone here ever used nicEdit? If how did you get around the menus (such as insert image or add link menus) from being appended to the body?
[09:30:22] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: what code?
[09:30:24] <BinaryKitten> the whole ajax code
[09:30:28] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: im not pasting the ajax call
[09:30:32] <ScottO_> thats irrelevant
[09:30:44] <BinaryKitten> so is my helping any further
[09:30:54] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: you are being weird
[09:30:56] <BinaryKitten> without that ajax call i can't see what you're doing
[09:31:03] <ScottO_> im donig an ajax call
[09:31:08] <ScottO_> thats all thats necessary
[09:31:11] <BinaryKitten> without seeing and understanding i can't see where you'e going wrong
[09:31:15] <ScottO_> huh?
[09:31:32] <BinaryKitten> you want to search the html returned for a hidden field.
[09:31:38] <BinaryKitten> i've given you the code to do that
[09:31:38] <ScottO_> ok theres a string i need to search for a hidden input
[09:31:41] <ScottO_> lets leave it there
[09:31:44] <BinaryKitten> you've said it doesn't work
[09:31:49] <ScottO_> how come i cant find the hidden niput in that string
[09:31:54] <ScottO_> why does the length come up as 0?
[09:31:54] <BinaryKitten> i need to see what you have to see why
[09:31:55] <logik-bomb> BinaryKitten: do you know how to select that field?
[09:32:05] <BinaryKitten> logik-bomb?
[09:32:08] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: how come the result of the pastebin is 0?
[09:32:16] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: it should be 1
[09:32:22] <BinaryKitten> because you're using find on the actual input
[09:32:22] <logik-bomb> BinaryKitten: :X sorry
[09:32:40] <BinaryKitten> find searches in child elements
[09:32:47] <ScottO_> ok
[09:32:51] <BinaryKitten> if you want to match it against the item, use .is
[09:32:56] <ScottO_> well i never asked to search for child elements
[09:33:00] <ScottO_> ok
[09:33:13] <BinaryKitten> you said "in the html"
[09:33:14] <ScottO_> i want to search the string for an input element
[09:33:22] <BinaryKitten> not that if the html is a hidden input
[09:33:24] <ScottO_> yes html being the string
[09:33:36] <BinaryKitten> see the confusion point?
[09:34:04] <ScottO_> i need to see if there is a hidden field contained  in the variable that is a string
[09:34:09] <ScottO_> is that more clear?
[09:34:18] <BinaryKitten> ok, lets clarify..
[09:34:37] <BinaryKitten> the string is a hidden field?
[09:34:39] <ScottO_> the html variable could contain other html without a hidden input
[09:34:56] <BinaryKitten> or is it a complete html structure that may contain a hidden field
[09:35:04] <BinaryKitten> ok so either or?
[09:35:11] <ScottO_> its HTML
[09:35:15] <ScottO_> i could be anythign html
[09:35:23] <ScottO_> *it
[09:35:24] <BinaryKitten> ok then find will work
[09:35:32] <ScottO_> ...
[09:35:36] <BinaryKitten> it won't work if the html IS just the input
[09:35:42] <diverdude> Does anybody know how to change this example to use key value pair data instead of a simple array?
[09:35:44] <BinaryKitten> because it's not a child
[09:35:49] <ScottO_> im not testing against an element
[09:35:55] <BinaryKitten> gah
[09:35:58] <BinaryKitten> ok..
[09:36:02] <BinaryKitten> let me be more clear
[09:36:11] <ScottO_> im trying to search for a hidden input field in the supplied strign
[09:36:43] <BinaryKitten> $('some<p>html</p><input type="hidden" />').find('input[type=hidden]').length = 1
[09:36:53] <BinaryKitten> $('<input type="hidden" />').find('input[type=hidden]').length = 0
[09:37:03] <BinaryKitten> $('<input type="hidden" />').is('input[type=hidden]').length = true
[09:37:05] <BinaryKitten> oops
[09:37:06] <Typh> ok, jquery when is just about impossible to google. When shouldn't block, should it? The current function should finish before the when ends up firing? This seems to be working in chrome, but in IE, the call to when blocks
[09:37:09] <BinaryKitten> $('<input type="hidden" />').is('input[type=hidden]') = true
[09:37:11] <ScottO_> why does it matter how many elements are in there?
[09:37:32] <ScottO_> the html could be many elements, or just one
[09:37:35] <BinaryKitten> because of how the selector engine works
[09:37:58] <ScottO_> btw your input wasnt actually a child
[09:38:12] <BinaryKitten> no but it is a child of the html
[09:38:25] <BinaryKitten> not a child of a tag that's a child of the html true
[09:38:30] <ScottO_> so if there is a single element, its treated differently than if the html has more than one element?
[09:38:33] <eddiemonge> Typh: code example?
[09:38:38] <BinaryKitten> but if you think of the html as an object
[09:38:43] <ScottO_> so a single element cant be a child?
[09:38:57] <ScottO_> thats silly
[09:39:05] <BinaryKitten> no because it's not a child of the html
[09:39:11] <ScottO_> it is a child of the html
[09:39:15] <BinaryKitten> the html you give IS the input or single item
[09:39:30] <ScottO_> lol
[09:39:33] <ScottO_> its just html
[09:39:55] <ScottO_> so if i put a useless <span></span> in there, it will work
[09:39:56] <BinaryKitten> if the html is only 1 tag, jquery treats it as the definition of the element
[09:40:02] <ScottO_> :/
[09:40:02] <BinaryKitten> yes
[09:40:08] <ScottO_> thats bad considering its still html
[09:40:12] <BinaryKitten> it's not bad
[09:40:17] <BinaryKitten> that's how html works
[09:40:27] <ScottO_> lol
[09:40:35] <ScottO_> so jquery assumes
[09:40:44] <BinaryKitten> not just jquery
[09:40:48] <BinaryKitten> native dom
[09:40:49] <ScottO_> that if theres one element, you mean to search inside of it
[09:40:50] <ccmonster> uhhh
[09:41:02] <Typh> eddiemonge: http://dpaste.com/627288/ in chrome, I get first second third, as expected. In IE7-9, I get first third second.
[09:41:06] <BinaryKitten> Scott0  search inside of that element ..
[09:41:11] <BinaryKitten> not check that element
[09:41:25] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: so if the returned html could have one or many elements, how would i handle this?
[09:41:59] <ScottO_> i just want to check to see if the html has or doesnt have an hidden input ANYWHERE in it
[09:42:02] <diverdude> Does anybody know how to change this example to use key value pair data instead of a simple array?
[09:42:10] <ScottO_> even if its the hiden input by itself
[09:42:13] <BinaryKitten> in reality i would suggest that you use string matching
[09:42:14] <ccmonster> whta example diverdude ?
[09:42:19] <diverdude> http://jsfiddle.net/Jqqz9/1/
[09:42:24] <ravenzz> ScottO_ $('input[type="hidden").length
[09:42:27] <BinaryKitten> rather than building and searching in this sense
[09:42:41] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: ok i think we are on the same page now :P thanks for that clarification
[09:42:49] <eddiemonge> diverdude: checkout the examples on jqueryui.com about the custom autocomplete
[09:42:49] <BinaryKitten> ravenzz welcome to the conversation, late entry but welcome
[09:42:57] <jeffsmykil> if a div is made on the fly would a hide necessarily see it?
[09:43:12] <ravenzz> i forgot a bracket
[09:43:18] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: so if i wrap my hidden input with a paragraph tag, then it would work
[09:43:23] <diverdude> eddiemonge, are there examples on how to implement key:value in autocomplete?
[09:43:26] <ravenzz> BinaryKitten ty :p
[09:43:27] <BinaryKitten> Scott0   /type="|'hidden"|'/gi.match(html)
[09:43:40] <BinaryKitten> Scott0 yes that would work
[09:43:42] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: i think thats what i might do
[09:43:52] <ScottO_> or a div
[09:43:53] <BinaryKitten> you could also use .is
[09:44:19] <ScottO_> yeah guess i only have to match on one of the situations, because the alternative is the other
[09:44:29] <eddiemonge> diverdude: yes. thats why i mentioned it. it basically creates its own autocomplete in one of the examples
[09:44:38] <ccmonster> why do you wavt a k,v pair?
[09:44:39] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: thanks for having patience with me
[09:44:39] <BinaryKitten> if ($(theHtml).find('input[type=hidden]').length  > 0 || $(theHtml).is('input[type=hidden]')) { ....
[09:44:41] <ccmonster> and what's the use case?
[09:44:45] <FNTom> A kitten made of one sand zeros? Scary...
[09:44:52] <ccmonster> very
[09:45:16] <ccmonster> what do you want the key, and the value to be ?
[09:45:21] <FNTom> Just a heads up, the stanford open courses (AI, Databases) enrollment ends soon :o
[09:45:24] <ravenzz> i suppose that he doesn't need to check if it is > 0
[09:45:30] <ravenzz> BinaryKitten isn't > 0 redundant?
[09:45:40] <pojo> Hey am making a mootools multiselect dropdown with grouping also for grouping i am using line seperater.which data structure should i use to send the list elements to plugin
[09:45:46] <BinaryKitten> ravenzz reduncy is good
[09:45:54] <diverdude> eddiemonge, you mean here? http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/  ? I dont really see a key/value example
[09:46:01] <FNTom> pojo: Mootools? Might be the wrong channel ;)
[09:46:02] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: ive seen times it doesnt work right without the >0
[09:46:15] * BinaryKitten too
[09:46:38] <ravenzz> why should it happen?
[09:47:06] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: i just did if (!$(html).is('input[type=hidden]')) {
[09:47:26] <theProphet> hello. is there a way of checking if the page was loaded in an active tab or not?
[09:47:27] <ScottO_> works great
[09:47:39] <eddiemonge> eval if ( 0 ) { "Hello"; }
[09:47:46] <tgodar> anyone done much drag and drop with UI?  Having some issues http://jsbin.com/uyogiv/3
[09:47:47] <eddiemonge> ?eval if ( 0 ) { "Hello"; }
[09:47:48] <bot-t> eddiemonge: undefined
[09:47:53] <eddiemonge> ?eval if ( -1 ) { "Hello"; }
[09:47:54] <bot-t> eddiemonge: "Hello"
[09:48:00] <theProphet> I'd like to start animating elements once the user opens the page, not when it loads in the browser
[09:48:00] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: ^^
[09:48:20] <theProphet> opens = views
[09:48:29] <eddiemonge> ScottO_: wrap the hidden in double quotes
[09:48:31] <diverdude> eddiemonge, could you please tell me exactly which example you are talking about?
[09:48:32] <BinaryKitten> Scott0  that's if the html isn't a hidden input
[09:48:47] <BinaryKitten> do you not want to check it if it contains a hidden input as well?
[09:48:48] <ravenzz> eddiemonge well but it is supposed that $('element').length will never return -1 :o
[09:49:07] <eddiemonge> diverdude: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[09:49:31] <ScottO_> BinaryKitten: no, if it doesnt, do this, and else do this
[09:49:32] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: and ie6 was once a great browser. things arent always what you expect
[09:49:46] <lenswipe> hey fuys
[09:49:47] <lenswipe> guys*
[09:49:54] <lenswipe> anyone able to help me with CKEditor development?
[09:50:54] <ravenzz> eddiemonge not in this case!?
[09:51:31] <Typh> eddiemonge: http://dpaste.com/627288/ in chrome, I get first second third, as expected. In IE7-9, I get first third second. <- any thoughts?
[09:51:35] <ravenzz> anyway np
[09:52:01] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: like BinaryKitten said: redundancy is good
[09:52:10] <lenswipe> anyone able to help me with CKEditor development?
[09:52:10] <eddiemonge> Typh: not sure
[09:52:58] <ScottO_> if a form field is in a div thats display:nonel will the form field data post?
[09:53:19] <ravenzz> yes
[09:53:27] <ravenzz> ScottO_ ^
[09:53:29] <ScottO_> im thinking it should as long as the fields isnt disabled
[09:53:33] <ScottO_> ok cool
[09:53:36] <ScottO_> thats what i thought
[09:53:43] <prophet> Sorry for the timeout.. Is there a way of checking if the page was loaded in an active tab or not? I'd like to start animating elements once the user opens (starts viewing) the page, not when the document loads in the browser.
[09:55:05] <ravenzz> starts viewing = while the document loads ?
[09:55:13] <ravenzz> is loading*
[09:55:43] <ravenzz> or when it is completely loaded?
[09:57:09] <thewonderidiot> hello
[09:57:17] <ScottO_> ...
[09:57:26] <theProphet> ravenzz no matter - if the tab is inactive the animation should not be started
[09:57:41] <theProphet> if the tab is active, on the other hand - animation starts
[09:58:19] <ravenzz> are you using jQuery UI tabs?
[09:58:21] <amdk6> back to you for my prob with checking if any of the children elements of a div had a class, I managed (i think) to do it using :        if ($('#myDiv a').find('.selected'))  { ...}
[09:58:37] <theProphet> I'm using focus() right now, but it does trigger the event when I'm opening the page in an active tab. If I open it in the background tab - the animation waits..
[09:58:51] <theProphet> ravenzz, I'm talking about browser window tabs
[09:58:59] <ravenzz> oh lol
[09:59:42] <theProphet> any ideas?
[09:59:52] <ravenzz> $(window).focu() I suppose
[09:59:58] <ravenzz> +s
[10:00:19] <ravenzz> and blur() or focusOut() when you switch to another window/tab
[10:00:40] <theProphet> ravenzz, opening the page in the same (active) tab does not trigger focus(), at least in chrome
[10:00:57] <ravenzz> well let me try..
[10:03:21] <theProphet> any luck? :)
[10:08:38] <ravenzz> theProphet http://jsfiddle.net/NTrPY/
[10:09:14] <inad922> how can I submit a post request so that ir will replace the current page like a real form submit with jquery?
[10:09:36] <theProphet> yup, does not get triggered if I just open the link in the same tab
[10:09:38] <ravenzz> ?ajax inad922
[10:09:39] <bot-t> ravenzz, Aug. 26, 2011 - Django IRC logs - http://django-irc-logs.com/2011/aug/26/
[10:09:44] <ravenzz> ?ajax @ inad922
[10:09:45] <bot-t> inad922, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:09:58] <theProphet> when I try to make it inactive (by switching to my IRC client) - then it gets triggered
[10:10:21] <inad922> ravenzz: Yea I know that but I want a real page reload. Is that possible somehow?
[10:10:24] <tgodar> http://jsbin.com/uyogiv/3 Cant figure this out.... Why can I drop the 'Field' to the bottom container, fire its drop event, and then have the li show up in the top container...?
[10:11:21] <theProphet> ravenzz, it triggers for you?
[10:11:32] <ravenzz> theProphet do you have a link in the current page you would click and have the animations before to leave the page?
[10:11:42] <ravenzz> sorry for my horrible english
[10:13:02] <theProphet> given your example with alert(); - I would open a browser window and type in the website address; there would be no alertbox once the page loads; the alertbox would appear when I minimised the window when using .blur()
[10:13:44] <sphinxxx> whats the quickest way to trim the last character off a string?
[10:13:46] <theProphet> I need the alertbox to appear when I type in the address and hit enter; though, the alertbox should not appear if I opened the link in a new tab and have not switched to it yeat
[10:13:48] <theProphet> yet*
[10:14:03] <Connor__> Hi all
[10:14:05] <Connor__> Got a strange bug
[10:14:06] <Connor__> HerE:
[10:14:06] <Connor__> http://jsfiddle.net/mDSbf/9/
[10:14:16] <Connor__> When you click the second image, it dosen't add the class
[10:14:22] <Connor__> Though clicking on the first image works fine
[10:15:04] <barfoo365> Hi all, for some reason my jquery animate function works on everything but Chrome.  The first animation works but the ones after that are positioned at the bottom of the page - http://pastebin.com/7rDd2iTj  Anyone any ideas whats happening?
[10:15:42] <Typh> Anyone with knowledge of when() know if there's any problems with IE? when causes a block for me in IE7-9. Works fine in chrome.
[10:16:15] <Typh> http://dpaste.com/627288/ in chrome, I get first second third, as expected. In IE7-9, I get first third second.
[10:16:55] <Typh> http://dpaste.com/627306/ rather
[10:17:34] <Connor__> Maybe IE waits for it to finish before console.logging second?
[10:17:43] <Connor__> Don't know why it would
[10:17:53] <Typh> right, that defeats the point :)
[10:18:18] <Connor__> Though try alert()
[10:18:25] <Connor__> console.log may have a different behaviour
[10:18:27] <Typh> no difference
[10:18:30] <Connor__> I see
[10:19:49] <bacilla> Is there a way to detect if a browser window is not currently active on pageload?
[10:20:47] <Connor__> What do you mean by active?
[10:21:44] <bacilla> Connor__, different tab for example
[10:22:01] <Connor__> On Chrome, yes. Only browser that supports that at the moment
[10:22:04] <Connor__> Let me get a link one sec
[10:22:12] <Connor__> W3 is making it a standard in all browsers
[10:23:11] <Connor__> http://code.google.com/chrome/whitepapers/pagevisibility.html
[10:23:17] <Connor__> There you go @Bacilla
[10:24:07] <bacilla> Connor__, I know about that, but I was wondering if such a thing could be done with jquery or something else compatible with older browsers :)
[10:24:18] <Connor__> Not that I know off
[10:24:26] <bacilla> damn..
[10:24:29] <Connor__> Indeed :)
[10:24:32] <Connor__> What do you need it for?
[10:25:05] <bacilla> just some animations; but it would be very cool if animations waited in the background if the tab is inactive :)
[10:25:27] <Connor__> Yeah, that's the same issue I am having
[10:25:46] <Connor__> Though, mine breaks if I can't tell if you are on another tab :(
[10:25:58] <JonathanNeal> What's the best way to loop through a collection in jQuery and keep a jQuery selection on each item in the collection?
[10:26:14] <Connor__> $.each?
[10:26:22] <JonathanNeal> $selection.index(1) ?
[10:26:32] <Connor__> That would only get the second element of the collection
[10:26:44] <bacilla> Connor__, ummm... .blur()? :)
[10:26:54] <Connor__> Apparently blur isn't reliable :P
[10:26:57] <Connor__> I did come across that
[10:27:07] <JonathanNeal> Connor__: what I meant was, I want to keep the jQuery wrappage.
[10:27:12] <bacilla> huh.. who knew :)
[10:27:17] <JonathanNeal> .each turns this into the native DOM node, doesn't it?
[10:27:30] <Zerpy> http://pastebin.com/etbyheN0 anyone that knows what I'm doing wrong?
[10:27:34] <Connor__> $.each(function() { console.log($(this)); });
[10:27:43] <Connor__> But if you only want 1 element jqueryIfied
[10:28:11] <Connor__> Then you can do eq(x) if you want to get a specific element from a collection
[10:28:17] <Connor__> index() only returns the index number
[10:29:02] <Connor__> @Zerpy, what is $(this).id?
[10:29:12] <barfoo365> Hi all, for some reason my jquery animate function works on everything but Chrome.  The first animation works but the ones after that are positioned at the bottom of the page - http://pastebin.com/7rDd2iTj  Anyone any ideas whats happening?
[10:32:27] <oal_> Hasn't jQueryUI been updated since 2010? Is it "dead"?
[10:32:41] <warrenparsons> It is most certainly not dead.
[10:32:52] <ccmonster> no, certainly not.
[10:33:01] <ccmonster> big 1.9 release coming with some schweet stuff
[10:33:20] <tgodar> bout ready to scrap jquery UI http://jsbin.com/uyogiv/6
[10:33:35] <kborchers> oal_: 1.8.16 was just released in August
[10:33:53] <ccmonster> that too
[10:34:06] <oal_> Ah, thanks. Hmm, I thought I saw last update was in January 2010 somewhere.
[10:34:10] <ccmonster> ug, this apple talk is too much. laammemee it needs to go away.
[10:34:19] <Zerpy> Connor_ because i'm passing the ID of the element via the dataTransfer property, which I can't get working at the moment.. The dataTransfer
[10:34:19] <ccmonster> it's like, oppressive white noise all around me.
[10:35:36] <Connor__> @Zerpy, I have never seend .id, is it a plain JS function? Try doing .attr('id');
[10:35:50] <Zerpy> I'll tyr
[10:35:53] <Zerpy> *try
[10:35:55] <objNoob> Hi
[10:36:34] <Zerpy> objNoob, don't ask xD
[10:36:39] <objNoob> I'm trying to access e.dataTransfer from a dragstart: function(e){ } call
[10:36:45] <objNoob> why?
[10:37:07] <Zerpy> http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/html5-drag-and-drop/ there u go
[10:37:58] <objNoob> Ahhh originalEvent
[10:38:30] <Connor__> Got an issue
[10:38:31] <Connor__> http://jsfiddle.net/mDSbf/11/
[10:38:56] <Connor__> The second image when clicked does not keep the 1 opacity added by mouseenter
[10:39:04] <Connor__> added by mouseenter/active class*
[10:45:15] <thewonderidiot> so, I have a question: we're POSTing data from a few text fields using jquery
[10:45:35] <thewonderidiot> it consistently works in every browser... but somewhere around 5-10% of the time Chrome fails to post
[10:45:46] <thewonderidiot> I've never seen the issue in FF or IE, just Chrome
[10:46:06] <Connor__> How do you mean Fail?
[10:46:14] <Connor__> Times out, just dosen't send the data?
[10:46:22] <thewonderidiot> nothing happens.
[10:46:25] <thewonderidiot> our server doesn't see the post
[10:50:38] <dreinull> how do I use an element that I set up with forms in a dialog and in a tab (one is used to create a resource and the dialog is used to edit it, so same functionality)?
[10:52:14] <Hornet> ajpiano, are you around?
[10:52:33] <ccmonster> adam is probably still recovering from Boston
[10:52:34] <ccmonster> :)
[10:52:36] <Hornet> heh
[10:52:41] <Hornet> damn, need a guru
[10:53:03] <dreinull> 0900-call-a-guru
[10:53:18] <ccmonster> what's the deal-io Hornet
[10:53:31] <Hornet> in short, serializeArray() is failing on one side of a split test, in IE7 & 8
[10:53:33] <dreinull> btw, in google talk you can ask guru for free
[10:53:44] <thewonderidiot> ooh, a little progress: Now chrome occasionally refreshes the page BEFORE posting
[10:53:51] <thewonderidiot> is there a way I can prevent that from happening?
[10:54:00] <Hornet> it seems related to the class names the testing code adds, but I can't work around that
[10:54:06] <ccmonster> ?demo @ thewonderidiot
[10:54:07] <bot-t> thewonderidiot, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:54:23] <Hornet> and before you ask I can't give a live link to this site
[10:54:24] <kborchers> ?demo @ Hornet
[10:54:25] <bot-t> Hornet, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:54:27] <Hornet> ^
[10:55:43] <thewonderidiot> it's locally hosted, can't provide a link
[10:55:58] <Hornet> that's why you have jsfiddle, the_real_crimper
[10:56:04] <Hornet> thewonderidiot even
[10:57:15] <ccmonster> fiddle it up homies
[10:57:20] <ccmonster> we need something tangible
[10:57:35] <Hornet> I can PM you it
[10:58:11] <Hornet> I can't copy the relevant code into fiddle as it doesn't exist in the html source, and nothing I have can copy the rendered html
[11:01:45] <tgodar> anyone actually understand how drag and drop works with jquery UI?  Really struggling with this http://jsbin.com/uyogiv/6
[11:03:34] <bitwise_> is there a way to generate a string with named parameter replacement? simliar to $.tmpl but for arbitrary text
[11:04:03] <bitwise_> $.tmpl('foo=${foo}', {foo:12}) doesnt work because the string is not html
[11:08:33] <MaxMeents> hey ajpiano, where do you live and how much would you charge for a consultation of a site before release?
[11:09:32] <MaxMeents> I'm in Nebraska and could very much use the opion of someone who has a good head on their sholders and would be able to say where there is a flaw in my plans
[11:09:44] <MaxMeents> and or setup
[11:10:52] <Typh> So, if I call deferred.done(), when happens? Does the current function hang until the deferred finishes, or does the function move on and execute done later?
[11:10:52] <barfoo365> Can anyone see why this animation works in firefox but not in internet explorer or chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/5YrF2/
[11:11:46] <swiggy> http://pastebin.com/fiGRjqaC -- can someone help me here? I am trying to populate my form elements with data response from a JSON response, but its not loading
[11:12:11] <swiggy> (the json response loads, but it doesnt change the values)
[11:12:28] <Rwhitbeck> ajpiano can you also send me your consultation rates?
[11:15:36] <swiggy> http://pastebin.com/fiGRjqaC -- can someone help me here? I am trying to populate my form elements with data response from a JSON response, but its not loading -- any reason why this would not change the values of my select and textboxes??
[11:17:25] <imsky> swiggy are you getting paid for this
[11:17:56] <ajpiano> MaxMeents: i'm not available for freelance consulting
[11:18:04] <ajpiano> Rwhitbeck: ^^
[11:18:07] <swiggy> what?
[11:18:29] <imsky> ajpiano: you're a playa baby
[11:18:37] <beepbeep_> What's the recommended way / plugin to create a custom checkbox?
[11:19:36] <Tatsh> find(':checked') and jquery UI buttonset doesn't work in IE7
[11:19:41] <Tatsh> as far as I can tell
[11:20:56] <tgodar> wtf, does accept: then invalidate drop: how can this be this messed up...
[11:22:12] <swiggy> can i get some help over here
[11:22:24] <imsky> some help: $25
[11:22:24] <swiggy> my select adn textbox's are not changing their values
[11:22:29] <swiggy> and i do not understand why
[11:23:09] <ngharo> but the rest are?
[11:24:07] <swiggy> what ngharo?
[11:24:13] <barfoo365> Can anyone see why this simple jquery animation works in firefox but not in internet explorer or chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/5YrF2/
[11:24:17] <imsky> the rest of help are $50 per help
[11:24:29] <imsky> it's a very reasonable price ngharo
[11:25:02] <ngharo> swiggy: have you looked at the console for errors?
[11:25:03] <swiggy> ajpiano, mind casting some intelligence over here? http://pastebin.com/fiGRjqaC
[11:25:08] <swiggy> there are no errors
[11:25:14] <swiggy> and i console.log my json data
[11:25:17] <swiggy> and athe data is there
[11:25:27] <ngharo> swiggy: i dont see data.valid in your response
[11:26:00] <swiggy> the else is being triggered, not valid
[11:26:05] <swiggy> which is correct
[11:26:11] <ccmonster> ajpiano: if someone is using jquery 1.3.2 would you suggest they upgrade? as in, are the benefits enough even if some tweaks are needed to make your existing code function?
[11:26:38] <swiggy> i also tried --> $("#outsideproductid option[value='"+data.productid+"']").attr("selected","selected");
[11:26:47] <swiggy> to change the selectbox, but its not changing the value either
[11:26:47] <tgodar> Having issues with sortable combined with droppable, main issue seems to be that when ever i drag over a drop target, then move off and drop, the item is dropped into the target but no drop event ever fires?
[11:27:57] <ngharo> swiggy: add the html to your paste
[11:31:53] <swiggy> ngharo, http://jsfiddle.net/FGM8Q/
[11:32:23] <silur> Hello
[11:33:30] <ngharo> swiggy: the rendered html please
[11:33:30] <silur> Q: Jquery UI demo shows cute buttons, but how can i actually make <button> tag to load new page (without javascript) ?
[11:33:39] <silur> (referring to this page: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/)
[11:33:51] <ccmonster> you can't load a jquery button without js
[11:34:08] <ccmonster> but a regular button, can trigger something if you'd wish
[11:34:13] <swiggy> its in the fiddle?
[11:34:25] <silur> ccmonster, so: <button> can only work with JS, <inout> can only work with outer <form> ?
[11:34:32] <silur> <input>
[11:34:52] <swiggy> what do you mean the rendered html?
[11:35:04] <silur> The only button that works from above example is <a>
[11:35:27] <ccmonster> <button> is a button. it's a html element.
[11:35:28] <ngharo> swiggy: this looks like server side template.  the output of the template.
[11:35:33] <ccmonster> <a> is used to jump pages
[11:35:39] <ccmonster> <button> can post to a page if you want.
[11:35:44] <ngharo> swiggy: are you wrapping your javascript in $(document).ready(function() { ... }) ?
[11:35:45] <ccmonster> I'm not sure what your issue is
[11:35:53] <swiggy> $(function(){ });
[11:35:54] <swiggy> yes
[11:36:03] <swiggy> but no it is not a server side template?
[11:36:14] <swiggy> well there is smarty involved
[11:36:14] <ccmonster> input can be anywhere, but typicall is in a <form>
[11:36:29] <swiggy> but that does not effect the problem
[11:38:33] <barfoo365> Can anyone see why this simple jquery animation works in firefox but not in internet explorer or chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/5YrF2/3/
[11:38:50] <ngharo> swiggy: http://jsfiddle.net/hD5Fg/1/
[11:39:09] <silur> So if i want <button> to jump to page, the only way to make it happen is via: $("button" ).click(function() { location.href="..."; }) ?
[11:39:35] <ccmonster> sure
[11:39:44] <ccmonster> or $('button').submit()...
[11:39:52] <swiggy> that doesnt answer my question... that is what i was originally doing
[11:39:54] <swiggy> and still am doing
[11:40:01] <swiggy> it still isnt selecting anything
[11:40:06] <swiggy> it wont even fill the textboxes
[11:40:44] <silur> ccmonster, thanks
[11:41:07] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to get the draggable item in the droppable's drop function?
[11:41:14] <ngharo> swiggy: got a live demo up?
[11:41:49] <tgodar> so im getting the sense nobody uses UI fro drag and drop or at least sure doesnt want to try and help with it over IRC... :(
[11:41:53] <silur> Kinda weird. They created <button> tag that is impotent out of the box. It's like buying a car in a dealership but they all come without engine, that customer has to build himself
[11:42:07] <silur> :-P
[11:42:20] <swiggy> is there a way i can put up a json response on jsfiddle?
[11:44:42] <ajpiano> ccmonster: absolutely
[11:45:26] <ajpiano> swiggy: not sure what's going on there
[11:45:29] <ajpiano> swiggy: yes you can
[11:45:41] <ajpiano> you can use the /echo/json
[11:45:47] <ccmonster> Hornet is having an issue with serializeArray() and it works everywhere buy IE it seems. He's using 1.3.2 and not sure what his issue is honestly.
[11:45:50] <ajpiano> there are examples on jsfiddle of how to mock ajax request
[11:45:55] <swiggy> well this is strange
[11:46:08] <swiggy> i am passing it an invalid taskid, meaning valid=false is being returned
[11:46:16] <swiggy> but it is still firing the } else {
[11:46:33] <ajpiano> swiggy: is the data actuall an object or a string
[11:46:40] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: Hornet 1.3.2? why?
[11:46:47] <ajpiano> ie, is the json properly being parsed
[11:47:09] <ccmonster> I dont think it is.
[11:47:12] <swiggy> $a = array ('valid'=>false);       echo json_encode($a);
[11:47:37] <ccmonster> he's leary of upgrading his jq version because it's a huge site and he's unsure of what an upgrade might actually break
[11:48:20] <ccmonster> anyway, not sure if the jq upgrade will solve his issue, figure it couldnt hurt though
[11:48:43] <adrianp> ccmonster: clone and test?
[11:48:53] <eddiemonge> upgrade that and then fix the broken things or maybe people wont even notice the broken stuff
[11:49:00] <ccmonster> lol
[11:49:17] <ccmonster> i think it's a big client, so i can't attest to that. but its an intersting issue, so sort of curious myself
[11:49:37] <Hornet> I'd love to upgrade it, but don't have the time to test everything
[11:49:40] <ccmonster> what adrianp ?
[11:49:48] <Hornet> especially not on the offchance that it 'might' help
[11:50:00] <Hornet> ideally I agree yes, however reality intrudes
[11:50:09] <ccmonster> life...uggh :)
[11:50:09] <Hornet> speaking of which, brb
[11:50:52] <swiggy> ajpiano, did you see my response?
[11:51:06] <ajpiano> no
[11:51:59] <swiggy> $a = array ('valid'=>false);       echo json_encode($a);
[11:52:07] <swiggy> is my json request/response
[12:01:02] <sanduz2> does jquery have a setInterval replacement? i get inconsistent behavior across browsers with it.
[12:02:04] <ajpiano> swiggy: i don't care about your php
[12:02:15] <ajpiano> i wanted to know what "data" is on the client side
[12:02:27] <phlx> Would anyone know of a tutorial that will show me how to create a div or container that when clicked on it will auto drop down the items that I would like to put inside? Without it having to reload the page
[12:02:34] <oal_> Will the way you create themes for jqueryui change in 1.9 or 2.0? Or will 1.8 themes be compatible?
[12:02:46] <swiggy> i got it to work in an ugly fashion
[12:02:56] <ajpiano> oal_: there will be new widgets, etc
[12:02:57] <swiggy> said fuck json and did it 'manually'
[12:03:07] <ajpiano> but you will be able to regenerate your theme
[12:03:09] <ajpiano> from the url in your theme.css
[12:03:14] <ajpiano> so that it has support for the new widgets, etc
[12:03:15] <BinaryKitten> evening ajpiano
[12:03:17] <ajpiano> swiggy: cool hack bro
[12:03:36] <oal_> Ok, good to know, ajpiano :)
[12:03:42] <swiggy> yep
[12:05:07] <initzero> anyone have an opinion on nesting html as text within html, e.g. <input type="hidden" value="<span>my text</span>" />
[12:05:25] <initzero> is there a "good way" to do this?
[12:06:03] <phlx> I could google it I am just not sure what that function is called
[12:06:11] <phlx> or is that a CSS function?
[12:06:24] <initzero> I'm wanting to stuff some html content into a place where it won't be rendered by the browser and then pull it out and append it to the dom based on an event
[12:07:14] <warrenparsons> initzero: Just store it in a var.
[12:07:26] <initzero> JS vars won't work as well for us
[12:07:42] <initzero> we're wanting to make it easy for non-devs to create content that will work dynamically
[12:07:50] <Hornet> well that sure as hell won't help
[12:08:00] <jakeasmith> hide it in a div with display: none
[12:08:06] <eddiemonge> initzero: sounds like a bad idea
[12:08:36] <Hornet> are you writing a website for xzibit?
[12:08:47] <initzero> I tried putting an iframe into a div w/display: none and it still downloaded the resource
[12:09:04] <warrenparsons> Hornet: Ha!
[12:09:38] <initzero> so if you had to nest html in html, what would be the best approach
[12:09:40] <initzero> ?
[12:10:02] <initzero> input type=hidden is the best idea I've got so far
[12:10:41] <adrianp> initzero: store as json, load using jquery and generate html that way
[12:10:46] <Hornet> hidden textarea, string/ js variable, pull it in via ajax/ahah
[12:11:07] <Hornet> but your method sounds inherantly messed up tbh
[12:11:07] <initzero> I was trying to avoid the non-dev writing anyting in JS syntax
[12:11:22] <adrianp> why not ajax pull data upon event
[12:11:39] <initzero> sure... this for a mostly static site
[12:11:52] <initzero> more of an interaction tweak
[12:12:34] <initzero> it's basically a show/hide toggle, but using display:none around an iframe doesn't prevent the iframe from downloading it's src
[12:13:54] <adrianp> you have to write some js if you want to toggle display or ajax pull data
[12:14:59] <initzero> well, I have js written that's included in the page, but it's functionality is all based on classes
[12:15:39] <initzero> It's sort of like I want a click event to that provides the new content inline with the thing that's being clicked
[12:15:58] <initzero> <input type="button" onClick="showThis('<p>hello</p>')" />
[12:17:34] <initzero> I guess a data attribute might be an approach, but our doctype is currently XHTML, not sure if it will be compatible
[12:19:25] <eddiemonge> initzero: still sounds like you are doing it ... wrong
[12:19:30] <beepbeep_> does is.(':checked') work in IE?
[12:19:41] <initzero> I'm open to a different approach
[12:20:12] <BinaryKitten> beepbeep_ should do
[12:20:47] <BinaryKitten> initzero are you needing xhtml?
[12:21:10] <initzero> the basic requirement on my end is: 1) make it easy for non-dev content editor to provide the dynamic content that will be added to the DOM based on a user click and 2) the HTML that will be written needs to be stored in a way that it doesn't get rendered by the browser
[12:21:20] <initzero> no, it's just a large templated system...
[12:21:38] <BinaryKitten> if you don't need it, don't worry about it
[12:22:05] <BinaryKitten> use a.n.other doc type, if one at all
[12:22:26] <initzero> I was just wondering if my doctype would need to correct for html5 to utilize a "data" attribute
[12:22:31] <BinaryKitten> as long as your code is semantic, then its not a problemt
[12:22:45] <BinaryKitten> doctypes are just for nicety really
[12:22:46] <initzero> so, I could do something like <a href=
[12:22:54] <initzero> opps...
[12:23:22] <initzero> so I could do something like <a href="doClick()" data="<p>hello</p>">click</a>
[12:23:32] <initzero> or data:something rather
[12:23:44] <BinaryKitten> nope
[12:23:55] <BinaryKitten> data-something="your data here for something"
[12:24:06] <initzero> gotcha
[12:24:17] <phlx> Would anyone know of a tutorial that will show me how to create a div or container that when clicked on it will auto drop down the items that I would like to put inside? Without it having to reload the page
[12:24:18] <eddiemonge> initzero: why are you letting non-devs add content directly to the page? are you trying to make a cms?
[12:24:21] <BinaryKitten> then jquery can use $(selector).data('something')
[12:24:32] <initzero> essentially the beginning of a cms
[12:24:51] <initzero> not formal, just an editor who can write raw html
[12:24:59] <initzero> (our person is an editor)
[12:25:03] <initzero> not creating an editor
[12:25:17] <eddiemonge> phlx: look at .load(), and .slideDown() in the api docs see ? slideDown
[12:25:19] <bot-t> phlx, .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[12:26:01] <phlx> eddiemonge: I really don't know a damn thing about javascript. So I'll have to find a working example of this code and copy and paste.
[12:26:18] <phlx> you know of any type of tutorial or anything that will show me how to do this?
[12:27:08] <phlx> or if i know what its called I could google it
[12:27:25] <eddiemonge> phlx: you should learn javascript first
[12:27:28] <phlx> if there is a special name for that type of thing. Should I just look for "javascript slidedown examples"
[12:27:39] <eddiemonge> initzero: whats with the click to show?
[12:27:42] <adrianp> IE will not render pages properly if the doctype is not set
[12:27:49] <phlx> eddiemonge: Well, I only need it for this one item. Dont really have time right now to learn javascript. Though I would like to eventually
[12:27:55] <adrianp> some pages..
[12:28:05] <eddiemonge> phlx: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Getting_Started
[12:28:20] <eddiemonge> phlx: then hire a developer if you dont want to learn javascript
[12:29:18] <initzero> eddiemonge: can you calrify what you're asking?
[12:29:44] <phlx> Well I am php/mysql/css/html developer. Just need a javascript function for an item on this page
[12:29:55] <eddiemonge> initzero: im just trying to figure out *exactly* what you are trying to accomplish
[12:31:31] <initzero> eddiemonge: something like this: <a href="javascript:doClick()" data-htmlContent="<p>hello</p>">click</a>
[12:31:54] <BinaryKitten> that really isn't the best way
[12:31:59] <initzero> The event target and the content I want to show is inline
[12:32:03] <BinaryKitten> why not just have a hidden div?
[12:32:13] <beepbeep_> http://codepad.org/pJHaLG0x anyone know how to write this better?
[12:32:21] <initzero> good question, my HTML content is an <iframe>
[12:32:33] <BinaryKitten> ?
[12:32:39] <BinaryKitten> now i'm more confused
[12:32:40] <initzero> the contents of the iframe are being downloaded even when it's inside a hidden div
[12:32:43] <initzero> not what I want
[12:33:02] <solidus-river> how do i prepend a li block to a ul?
[12:33:08] <rpflo> If you call .abort on a deferred ajax object, does it call the error handlers?
[12:33:58] <initzero> basicaly, in my specific use case we have an embedded youtube player (in the form of an iframe) that we want to show when someone clicks a thumbnail of the video
[12:34:24] <initzero> if we put the iframe in a hidden div it downloads the youtube content and slows down loading of the page
[12:34:48] <initzero> I basically want a way to store the <iframe> tag in the DOM w/o it being rendered by the browser
[12:35:00] <initzero> for example, I could put it in an HTML comment and then strip off the comment tags
[12:35:23] <beepbeep_> http://codepad.org/pJHaLG0x anyone know how to write this better?
[12:35:29] <eddiemonge> initzero: is this just for youtube videos?
[12:35:32] <BinaryKitten> solidus-river  .appendTo?
[12:35:40] <BinaryKitten> ?.appendTo @ solidus-river
[12:35:41] <bot-t> solidus-river, .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[12:35:46] <BinaryKitten> ?.append @ solidus-river
[12:35:46] <bot-t> solidus-river, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[12:36:44] <eddiemonge> beepbeep_: why is your js inline?
[12:36:45] <BinaryKitten> yes beepbeep_
[12:36:58] <eddiemonge> oh its not, nevermind
[12:37:00] <jmar777> in jquery mobile, is it possible to tell within a `pagebeforechange` handler whether or not we're navigating due to a back-button click (or other actions resulting in history.back() being invoked)?
[12:37:02] <BinaryKitten> you don't need the "IE Fix"
[12:37:07] <initzero> it's not just for youtube videos, could be for anytype of html content; however youtube videos are what cause the page to slow down if they all get loaded when the page is rendered
[12:37:18] <BinaryKitten> just put some content in the label
[12:37:39] <beepbeep_> as in &nbsp; ?
[12:37:49] <BinaryKitten> no as in what the checkbox is for
[12:38:11] <BinaryKitten> just putting a space in isn't going to make the user want to click it
[12:38:21] <BinaryKitten> an empty label is a pointless label
[12:39:48] <BinaryKitten> gah
[12:40:16] <eddiemonge> beepbeep_: http://jsfiddle.net/jS3dk/
[12:40:24] <jmar777> oops, nvm my question. just saw the #jquerymobile room
[12:41:00] <solidus-river> how do i do data remote on a form submission?
[12:41:03] <beepbeep_> thx for tips
[12:41:10] <solidus-river> oh whoops
[12:41:21] <beepbeep_> so whats the deal with placing checkbox in label vs placing checkbox behind/in front of label?
[12:41:45] <eddiemonge> initzero: you really need a different solution to your "problem"
[12:42:11] <jbpalacio> what's the simplest jquery history plugin? and can load specific div only?
[12:42:53] <eddiemonge> beepbeep_: nothing. <label><input type="checkbox" id="cbid"/> Label Text</label> is the same as <label for"cbid">Label TExt</label><input type="checkbox" id="cbid"/>
[12:43:10] <eddiemonge> only difference is when it comes to sizing the label text with css
[12:43:23] <eddiemonge> jbpalacio: need more info
[12:43:24] <initzero> eddiemonge: I'm open to suggestions
[12:44:23] <eddiemonge> initzero: you still havent accurately described your problem yet. What is the end goal of what you want to happen?
[12:45:06] <jbpalacio> eddiemonge: I am looking for a jquery plugin that similar to bbq but much easier to implement
[12:45:34] <eddiemonge> bbq isnt easy?
[12:47:20] <initzero> eddigemonge: ultimately I'm creating a re-usable widget that displays various links (usually thumbnail images); when clicked new HTML content is added to the dom
[12:47:21] <jbpalacio> eddiemonge: I just needed a simple way to use url hash and just load a specific div from a page
[12:47:31] <beepbeep_> btw, eddiemonge
[12:47:36] <BinaryKitten> eddiemonge the issue i have with your code is that it's a checkbox and you're hiding it
[12:47:36] <beepbeep_> nothing happens when I click it
[12:47:43] <beepbeep_> which is why I wrote the "IE fix"
[12:47:54] <BinaryKitten> sorry. beepbeep_  with your stuff
[12:47:59] <BinaryKitten> (sorry eddiemonge)
[12:48:17] * BinaryKitten has lost track
[12:48:22] <beepbeep_> haha :)
[12:48:22] <initzero> eddigemonge: I want the new HTML content to be stored adjancent to the thumbnail that it's associated with
[12:48:40] <BinaryKitten> initzero put it in there
[12:48:42] <BinaryKitten> and hide it
[12:48:44] <BinaryKitten> then show it
[12:49:44] <eddiemonge> initzero: where is the html content coming from?
[12:49:51] <beepbeep_> so, BinaryKitten, how would you create a somewhat browser compatible checkbox with custom graphic
[12:50:34] <initzero> eddigemonge: it's something that the page author creates, it doesn't exist anywhere besides this (static) page
[12:51:05] <eddiemonge> so no db or flat files?
[12:51:19] <initzero> eddigemonge: I guess I should say, what I have is working.. I was just wondering if there was something more effective than using <input type="hidden"
[12:51:51] <`teh1> hey guys, how do i get jquery to recognize the variable 'move' as being in a scope above this?
[12:51:52] <initzero> eddigemonge: I do think using an html5 data element is a little better, but effectively the same thing as I was doing
[12:51:53] <`teh1> $(el).hover(function(){move=false},function(){move=true;setTimeout('move()',10);});
[12:51:59] <initzero> eddigemonge: no db, just html pages
[12:54:26] <sublimenal> Hi there im having an issue with jquery ui auto complete. I keep gettin a is null and c is null javascript errors. Here is my page  http://wcmp.org/index.php?act=affiliations and say you search for "sportsman" it displays the error in firebug.  Here is my json which is formated fine. Has anyone had this issue? http://wcmp.org/ajax.php?function=aff-searcher&term=sportsman
[12:55:42] <BinaryKitten> sublimenal could it be that there is a null in the returned values?
[12:56:01] <`teh1> whoa BinaryKitten you are in here :3
[12:56:13] <BinaryKitten> goolie
[12:56:14] <pootietang> hey guys, has anyone used the supersized! background slider?
[12:56:15] <BinaryKitten> ?
[12:56:19] <`teh1> yeah
[12:56:20] <`teh1> me!
[12:56:23] <pootietang> ok
[12:56:25] <`teh1> lol
[12:56:26] <BinaryKitten> heh
[12:56:29] <sublimenal> well the thing is the json is returned not null http://wcmp.org/ajax.php?function=aff-searcher&term=sportsman
[12:56:30] <pootietang> here's my question
[12:56:37] <`teh1> pootietang:  sorries that was @ BinaryKitten
[12:56:42] <BinaryKitten> sublimenal no it's not
[12:56:45] <BinaryKitten> but one of the values is
[12:56:58] <pootietang> I want to be fable to trigger the autostart when I click on a menu item
[12:57:06] <sublimenal> ah i see what your saying
[12:57:06] <pootietang> oh!
[12:57:08] <pootietang> k
[12:57:14] <sublimenal> thanks
[12:57:18] <BinaryKitten> sublimenal np
[12:57:22] <crankharder> there has to be a better way of attaching this click event without using this stupid 'callingElement' variable: http://pastie.org/2639704
[12:57:37] <sublimenal> I think I am pulling to many results with 3 letters so I will limit it
[12:58:50] <antihero> How would I get something triggered when a certain point is scrolled past?
[12:58:51] <widoz> hello, is possible to disable title attribute for a specific div?
[12:59:14] <warrenparsons> widoz: disable or remove?
[12:59:19] <BinaryKitten> ?g jquery waypoints
[12:59:20] <bot-t> BinaryKitten, jQuery Waypoints - http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/
[12:59:29] <BinaryKitten> @ antihero
[12:59:31] <widoz> warren disable
[12:59:51] <antihero> BinaryKitten: Can I do them dynamically?
[13:00:01] <antihero> So like, if I scroll to within 200px of the bottom of the page
[13:00:02] <warrenparsons> widoz: Not sure I follow. You want to prevent them from displaying on hover, but keep them in the code?
[13:00:33] <BinaryKitten> antihero yes
[13:00:40] <BinaryKitten> have a look at jquery way points
[13:00:46] <BinaryKitten> and then look at the options
[13:00:54] <widoz> warrenparsons i've using a tiptip for showing title attribute, but social slider gone crazy if that script enable
[13:01:38] <warrenparsons> widoz: Sorry, I don't understand.
[13:02:06] <BinaryKitten> widoz if two scripts are incompatible
[13:02:16] <BinaryKitten> then you need to talk to the script owners
[13:02:41] <larzen-wrk1> i want to select the 4th element in a set of elements with a css class ".helloWorld" - using CSS2, any ideas?
[13:03:01] <jedimind_> incompatible scripts? damn, whats this world coming to ?
[13:03:06] <jedimind_> cant we all just get along
[13:03:12] <larzen-wrk1> the container has mixed elements, so i cannot use nth-child type thing.
[13:03:29] <jedimind_> *:nth-child
[13:05:44] <BinaryKitten> eddiemonge are you stalking me?
[13:10:35] <enjoycrf> HAY
[13:10:39] <jedimind_> OH HAI
[13:10:41] <enjoycrf> im back
[13:10:46] <jedimind_> YAY
[13:10:58] <enjoycrf> \o/
[13:11:08] <jedimind_> ok, now you're just being silly
[13:11:53] <enjoycrf> hAy how do i check for browser resize in jQ
[13:13:13] <warrenparsons> enjoycrf: $(window).on('resize', function(){ callback });
[13:13:25] <enjoycrf> thx
[13:13:32] <warrenparsons> or $(window).bind('resize.... if on less than 1.7
[13:13:52] <leetcharmer> Sup all
[13:13:56] <enjoycrf> bind looks cleaner to me
[13:14:23] <warrenparsons> Bind is also on its way to being obsolete. .on() and .off() are the new unified event setters
[13:14:24] <leetcharmer> Can I get assistance for jquery ui here?
[13:14:38] <kborchers> leetcharmer: yes
[13:14:49] <enjoycrf> actualy dont have bind anywhere in my code
[13:15:04] <leetcharmer> I'm trying to implement an accordion that is controlled by submit buttons
[13:15:58] <leetcharmer> Should I be using accordion ( "option", "activate", index ) on click?
[13:17:25] <enjoycrf> i have like a billion nested callbacks lol
[13:17:32] <enjoycrf> its awesum
[13:18:19] <enjoycrf> window.on is not a function man
[13:18:50] <cnnr> i'm writing a plugin, and for some reason, when i hover over the <li> that shows up, this is referencing just the outside parts of the <li>, not the text inside OR the span inside of it. However, if i look at it in the inspector, it's fine. here's a gist - https://gist.github.com/527d2359fe1a2da13728
[13:18:51] <BinaryKitten> lol
[13:18:55] <kborchers> .on is only in jQuery 1.7 and it would $(window).on
[13:19:36] <enjoycrf> $(window).resize(function() {
[13:19:39] <enjoycrf> dood comon
[13:19:43] <enjoycrf> get w the program
[13:20:12] <Ezo> Hmm, I just noticed that you can stack namespaced events on each other, even if the namespace already exits. Was that intended?
[13:20:21] <enjoycrf> y do i always have to do everything
[13:20:46] <Kambfhase> life is tough.
[13:23:54] <enjoycrf> $(window).hashchange(function(e) {
[13:24:15] <jedimind_> http://keithamus.github.com/jwerty/
[13:24:16] <jedimind_> neat
[13:24:36] <enjoycrf> BBQ is not bad at all
[13:24:47] <enjoycrf> i thot i had to drag RSH in
[13:25:05] <jedimind_> ewww
[13:25:09] <jdummy> Can anyone help me make sense of this?  I'm trying to reference part of an object from within the object... grandparent = { name : 'papa', parent : { child : { testing : grandparent.name } } } ... or http://jsfiddle.net/EhQ8Q/1/
[13:25:31] <jdummy> Not sure if my question is even the right one :(
[13:25:56] <jedimind_> thats some black magic right there
[13:26:17] <jedimind_> you might have to finish defining it, then expand on it with the grandchild items
[13:26:42] <jdummy> Pooh.  Why would that be?
[13:27:04] <Kambfhase> you cannot `go up` the tree
[13:27:11] <jdummy> I've tried many combinations of this, self and parent to no avail
[13:27:18] <Kambfhase> you need to explicitly refeerence the root
[13:27:35] <jdummy> Is it because the object doesn't exist yet at that point?
[13:27:51] <jedimind_> thats my thought
[13:28:01] <jdummy> But I thought that's what I was doing by referencing 'grandparent'.
[13:28:02] <Kambfhase> is it because your object can exist in two trees at once
[13:29:23] <eddiemonge> BinaryKitten: what do you mean am i stalking you?
[13:29:33] <BinaryKitten> twitter
[13:30:04] <aaronmcadam> oh hey BinaryKitten not seen you around for a while :)
[13:30:17] <eddiemonge> BinaryKitten: oh. then yes. yes i am. is that ok?
[13:30:26] <BinaryKitten> sure free world
[13:30:37] <BinaryKitten> aaronmcadam i know been soooo busy
[13:30:45] <BinaryKitten> working 9am-11pm
[13:32:25] <aaronmcadam> dayum
[13:32:32] <aaronmcadam> are you freelancing along with the day job?
[13:32:42] <p3llin0r3> Hey guys I have a question. I'm using document.createelement('iframe') right? Well, i want to change the size of this iframe to be larger. Does anyone know a trick?
[13:32:51] <aaronmcadam> or are you doing some crazy stuff with zend :p
[13:33:20] <jdummy> p3llin0r3, add a style attribute
[13:34:19] <jdummy> p3llin0r3, or use jquery... var el = document.createElement('iframe'); $(el).css({ 'width' : 300, 'height' : 300 });
[13:35:01] <p3llin0r3> hmm i will try that thank
[13:35:24] <ccmonster> that should work.
[13:41:30] <aaronmcadam> BinaryKitten: I just recommended your keyz plugin a few days ago, you remember that one?
[13:41:56] <aaronmcadam> fuck me the jqm themeroller kicks ass! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REfFWx5eUVI
[13:42:21] <BinaryKitten> aaronmcadam yep
[13:42:28] <BinaryKitten> still needs a bit of work on it as well
[13:42:37] <aaronmcadam> u all backend these days?
[13:44:20] <BinaryKitten> aaronmcadam mostly just job-related work meant i've had no time
[13:44:37] <BinaryKitten> going to put it on Github and O/S it
[13:44:48] <aaronmcadam> what exactly?
[13:45:16] <simple__> im working in a thickbox, so i am trying to submit forms inside and have the inside reload.  Currently im using .html() to print overtop the body of the thickbox.   It seems to be working, but the <script> is being taken out when it reprints, and i cannot get the script to run again once a link inside the thickbox is loaded.  whats going on here?
[13:45:30] <BinaryKitten> aaronmcadam can you context that "what" for me please?
[13:46:18] <aaronmcadam> 'what exactly'.call( 'going to put it on Github and O/S it')
[13:47:15] <aaronmcadam> there's your context hehe :D
[13:47:43] <BinaryKitten> keyz
[13:47:47] <BinaryKitten> :p
[13:48:23] <aaronmcadam> ah you mean it's not already? :p
[13:48:44] <BinaryKitten> nope
[13:49:16] <aaronmcadam> it's not licensed? :o
[13:49:27] <aaronmcadam> or just not on github :D
[13:49:38] <BinaryKitten> its open licensed just not on github
[13:50:13] <BinaryKitten> i license most of my code under the YBIYBI License
[13:50:49] <BinaryKitten> You Break It, You didn't Buy it.
[13:51:00] <BinaryKitten> or some sort of thing
[13:51:07] <jedimind_> sigh
[13:51:10] <jedimind_> i actually looked it up
[13:51:23] <BinaryKitten> :D
[13:51:33] <BinaryKitten> I make most of my stuff up
[13:51:39] <BinaryKitten> it's more fun that way
[13:51:42] * jedimind_ takes a note
[13:52:20] <BinaryKitten> basic concept of the license is that you get what it is and you can use it how it's intended. beyond that, you're on your own.
[13:52:41] <FNTom> Unless they're willing to pay lots of money!
[13:52:43] <jedimind_> even that seems too much
[13:52:45] <aaronmcadam> BinaryKitten: this one : http://bit.ly/iI6uoK
[13:52:46] <jedimind_> in my case its more like
[13:52:58] <jedimind_> "you get it as is, and even if you use it as intended, you're on your own"
[13:53:10] <aaronmcadam> from my link: DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE
[13:53:14] <lewsid> anyone use amplify?
[13:53:24] <aaronmcadam> no but thought it was interesting
[13:53:32] <Travis-42> When I let jQuery make an intelligent guess about the datatype, how can I see what type it decided on?
[13:53:35] <BinaryKitten> jedimind ah no, If you need help with intended use i generally help
[13:53:55] <aaronmcadam> I used backbone lewsid
[13:53:57] <BinaryKitten> Travis-42  define "datatype" in your sentence
[13:54:01] <lewsid> I'm trying to wield it for the first time
[13:54:04] <jedimind_> thats because youre nicer than i am
[13:54:19] <aaronmcadam> think he means json, xml, etc
[13:54:26] <lewsid> and I'm wondering what other dataTypes besides 'json' I can use
[13:54:35] <aaronmcadam> xml, html
[13:54:41] <lewsid> wunderbar
[13:54:42] <Travis-42> BinaryKitten, jQuery.ajax() has a setting called dataType, which can be set to xml, json, script, html or left blank for a guess
[13:54:48] <BinaryKitten> text too
[13:54:55] <aaronmcadam> dataTypeThe type of data expected from the server. Default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html).
[13:55:04] <BinaryKitten> jedimind also means that I possibly learn and improve things
[13:55:09] <lewsid> ahh I see, looks like it overlaps with jquery ajax in this regard
[13:55:19] <Travis-42> if I let it be an intelligent guess, I want to know how I can find out what jQuery guessed it to be
[13:55:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah you get to see edge cases
[13:55:31] <BinaryKitten> jquery doesn't guess
[13:55:36] <BinaryKitten> it uses the content-type header
[13:55:41] <danzik17> Travis-42: It's not guessing - it's pretty well defined on ?ajax
[13:55:42] <aaronmcadam> I'd presume yeah mime type
[13:55:52] <Travis-42> danzik17, BinaryKitten, I'm just using the language that jQuery  uses itself in their documentation, don't be nit picky
[13:56:07] <Nitrxgen_> nit picky
[13:56:07] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's a docs thing
[13:56:09] <BinaryKitten> i'm not being nit picky
[13:56:23] <danzik17> Travis-42: It's really not being nit picky.  It says straight out what mime types it'll parse, and the rest is string.
[13:56:23] <Nitrxgen> highlighting me
[13:56:43] <Travis-42> you're telling me I'mw rong for referring to it as a guess, when that's what jquery refers to it as. I'm being no more literal than jquery docs are
[13:56:49] <BinaryKitten> Nitrxgen fix your highlighting
[13:56:51] <BinaryKitten> :p
[13:56:51] <aaronmcadam> that's what it means by "Intelligent Guess"
[13:57:17] <Nitrxgen> BinaryKitten, I can't win, people use "nit" to refer to me and complain when I don't respond lol
[13:57:20] <aaronmcadam> it means "it will check the mime type for you and set it if you don't want to explicitly set it"
[13:57:20] <Travis-42> so if I want to know the returned data type, do I have to also manually check the content type, or does jquery store what type it determined it to be ?
[13:57:25] <BinaryKitten> Travis-42 apologies, i've never let it guess
[13:57:33] <aaronmcadam> same here
[13:57:40] <aaronmcadam> think it's good to be explicit
[13:57:44] <BinaryKitten> i always pass the data type
[13:58:14] <aaronmcadam> or are you saying Travis-42, that you don't *know* what the dataType is going to be?
[13:58:30] <Travis-42> aaronmcadam, in this case, I don't know in advance.
[13:58:38] <aaronmcadam> right, makes sense now :)
[13:59:13] <aaronmcadam> it should be on the properties of the jqxhr object
[13:59:19] <aaronmcadam> you'd think
[13:59:47] <Travis-42> hmm, I'll check it more carefully aaronmcadam , thanks

[14:09:00] <aaronmcadam> bad MDN, bad!
[14:09:01] <aaronmcadam> lol
[14:09:13] <aaronmcadam> it just wraps the context
[14:09:29] <aaronmcadam> probably overly simplistic but...
[14:09:33] <diverdude> for what purpose?
[14:09:37] <aaronmcadam> ?g javascript closures @ diverdude
[14:09:38] <bot-t> diverdude, Javascript Closures - http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/
[14:09:47] <aaronmcadam> code portability
[14:10:10] <aaronmcadam> if you don't understand it, use $( document ).ready()
[14:10:17] <warrenparsons> Damn, fixingthesejquery.com is priceless.
[14:10:21] <aaronmcadam> best to be explicit anyway if you don't get it
[14:10:25] <diverdude> the page dont load
[14:10:31] <aaronmcadam> yeah adam did an awesome job warrenparsons
[14:10:34] <warrenparsons> 3 panels in and I was crying
[14:10:35] <aaronmcadam> what page?
[14:10:40] <diverdude> http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/
[14:10:40] <bencc> how can I add an existing element to a set of jquery elements?
[14:10:46] <aaronmcadam> that's just a google search
[14:10:56] <aaronmcadam> can't vouch for the results
[14:10:56] <bencc> $lis = $(li); // how to add a new li to this?
[14:11:13] <aaronmcadam> ?append @ bencc
[14:11:14] <bot-t> bencc, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:11:38] <aaronmcadam> if it's a list of links with events you want to attach see ?delegate
[14:11:39] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:12:00] <diverdude> aaronmcadam, so doing  $(function() {...}); corresponds to making $( document ).ready()?
[14:12:20] <aaronmcadam> it's not exactly, but a sort of shortcut
[14:12:24] <aaronmcadam> just use ready for now
[14:12:32] <aaronmcadam> are you starting out with js?
[14:12:49] <diverdude> aaronmcadam, no
[14:12:59] <diverdude> aaronmcadam, i can do quite well jquery
[14:13:04] <aaronmcadam> do u know what a closure is?
[14:13:14] <diverdude> aaronmcadam, a scope?
[14:13:23] <aaronmcadam> kinda
[14:13:42] <aaronmcadam> anyway it doesn't really add anything, best to be explicit with your readys
[14:14:01] <aaronmcadam> for other people and your own sanity
[14:14:52] <diverdude> yes...i prefer explicitness...but other people (also jquery ui demos) use $(function(){})...hence my question
[14:15:02] <aaronmcadam> diverdude: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Closures
[14:15:07] <aaronmcadam> ah! right :)
[14:16:37] <BinaryKitten> $(fnction(){}) = document.onready
[14:16:56] <BinaryKitten> (function($) { })(jQuery) = closure
[14:17:05] <jedimind_> i disagree
[14:17:23] <aaronmcadam> bingoooo :D
[14:17:32] <BinaryKitten> technically a function in js creates a closure
[14:17:34] <BinaryKitten> but meh
[14:17:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah :)
[14:17:43] <aaronmcadam> self executing funcs
[14:17:52] <aaronmcadam> get rid of those bloody init functions please! :D
[14:18:19] <eddiemonge> self executing functions can still have init functions
[14:18:24] <aaronmcadam> i kno i kno
[14:18:26] <BinaryKitten> .init isnt bad
[14:18:42] <BinaryKitten> self executing should create the init
[14:18:57] <aaronmcadam> but I see them all the time in the codebase I deal with
[14:19:01] <BinaryKitten> which should create the other parts
[14:19:06] <BinaryKitten> which then run the code
[14:19:10] <BinaryKitten> that then changes the dom
[14:19:15] <eddiemonge> (function($) {  $(function(){ }); })(jQuery);
[14:19:15] <BinaryKitten> which triggers a reaction
[14:19:17] <aaronmcadam> I use the $.extend defaults pattern with modules
[14:19:28] <BinaryKitten> which calls stuff set up in the self executing item
[14:19:33] <aaronmcadam> sensible defaults with configurable options
[14:19:44] <aaronmcadam> uhuh
[14:19:56] <BinaryKitten> see my lovely circular logic?
[14:19:58] <aaronmcadam> basically it's code written by people who don't know js or understand it
[14:20:10] <aaronmcadam> yep inception all the way :)
[14:20:17] <BinaryKitten> heh
[14:20:30] * BinaryKitten strokes her totem object
[14:20:44] <aaronmcadam> I have to start giving meetings on how js actually works
[14:21:02] <aaronmcadam> asynchronisity
[14:21:09] <aaronmcadam> i seem to have made up my own word
[14:21:10] <aaronmcadam> lol
[14:21:20] <aaronmcadam> I used it a few times in one presentation, hmmm :)
[14:21:31] <BinaryKitten> synergochronosyncronicity
[14:21:51] <aaronmcadam> uhm well, it does take time I guess
[14:21:51] <aaronmcadam> :P
[14:22:10] <aaronmcadam> it's basically guys writing it not actually realising that it's not sequential
[14:22:21] <aaronmcadam> i.e. blocking calls effecting other blocking calls
[14:22:49] <aaronmcadam> and lovely stuff like ajax callbacks that never get cancelled if not needed. lovely :)
[14:22:56] <BinaryKitten> heh
[14:23:12] <aaronmcadam> ajax everywhere :)
[14:23:16] <BinaryKitten> aaronmcadam we've managed to get a client to sign off on reverselogical before
[14:23:34] <aaronmcadam> what?
[14:23:40] <leetcharmer> I got my accordion to work :)
[14:23:49] <aaronmcadam> play us a tune then :D
[14:23:56] <BinaryKitten> heh
[14:24:02] <BinaryKitten> sea shanty please
[14:24:04] <aaronmcadam> what ye mean?
[14:24:20] <leetcharmer> Is it possible to add summary data to the collapsed accordion sections?
[14:24:27] <aaronmcadam> a new "technical phrase" for him to learn?
[14:24:51] <BinaryKitten> aaronmcadam  reverselogical was something one of us said by accident
[14:24:59] <aaronmcadam> leetcharmer: you mean "see more about this stuff..." alongside a title?
[14:25:06] <BinaryKitten> and we then had a pool going on who could actually get a client to sign off on it
[14:25:06] <aaronmcadam> meaning what tho?
[14:25:21] <BinaryKitten> the logical reversion of a process
[14:25:36] <aaronmcadam> P == !NP? :p
[14:25:49] <aaronmcadam> !!P == P?
[14:25:50] <aaronmcadam> :o
[14:25:51] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[14:26:08] <BinaryKitten> more like reverse = esrever
[14:26:30] <aaronmcadam> sexy
[14:26:38] <aaronmcadam> reminds me of year 1 comp science :)
[14:26:57] * BinaryKitten now going to try to get people to use palindromical
[14:27:04] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[14:27:20] <aaronmcadam> heheh!
[14:27:31] <aaronmcadam> kinda like a "spherical bastard"
[14:27:37] <BinaryKitten> no
[14:27:40] <aaronmcadam> a sphere is a sphere no matter which angle u look at it
[14:27:47] <BinaryKitten> more it gives the same no matter what end you poke
[14:28:10] <jedimind_> i disagree
[14:28:11] <aaronmcadam> was an old joke some irish comedian said one time
[14:28:30] <BinaryKitten> jedimind *waves hand* you don't disagree
[14:28:35] <aaronmcadam> "no matter which way I look at ye, you're still a bastard"
[14:30:25] <Tatsh> linking to data: uri impossible in IE9?
[14:30:31] <Tatsh> i'm kind of surprised
[14:32:19] <CodeZombie> I have 2 images, one laid over the other. These are both absolutely positioned against the top/left. You can drag the top image, and align it over the bottom one. This is done using jquery ui draggable. However, I recently added a zoom in/out option, I've tried both scale() and animate() on width, and when you zoom in, align, and then zoom out they become unaligned. Can anyone think of a way to keep the position?
[14:33:06] <aaronmcadam> are u storing their original positions?
[14:33:25] <CodeZombie> aaronmcadam: not at the moment
[14:33:44] <aaronmcadam> got a fiddle?
[14:33:58] <CodeZombie> let me see if I can set one up
[14:34:02] <aaronmcadam> cool
[14:34:16] <aaronmcadam> u used it before?
[14:34:27] <CodeZombie> once or twice
[14:34:30] <aaronmcadam> cool

[14:40:12] <r3pek> who has gmail? ;)
[14:40:23] <aaronmcadam> why? new features?
[14:40:41] <r3pek> i'm trying to do a button similar to their's
[14:40:44] <jedimind_> people still use email ?
[14:40:52] <r3pek> but i'm having a problem with "double click"
[14:40:55] <r3pek> :(
[14:40:56] <jedimind_> r3pek, gmail has several themes
[14:41:01] <jedimind_> oh you mean functionality wise
[14:41:08] <r3pek> the background get's selected :/
[14:41:19] <r3pek> i already prevent event bubbling (i think)
[14:41:37] <r3pek> anyone care to look at my code?
[14:41:49] <r3pek> maybe i'm missing something really simple :/
[14:41:51] <jedimind_> http://solidlystated.com/scripting/proper-way-to-disable-text-selection-and-highlighting/
[14:41:59] <aaronmcadam> gmail?
[14:42:00] <jedimind_> and im assuming youre using the doubleclick event
[14:42:14] <aaronmcadam> if u double click, firefox selects text it looks like
[14:42:26] <duanemoody> i have seen the worst coded webpage in many years
[14:42:30] <aaronmcadam> seems to select the first word closest
[14:42:41] <duanemoody> it loads two versions of jquery
[14:42:55] <aaronmcadam> not unheard of
[14:43:02] <aaronmcadam> unfortunately
[14:43:05] <duanemoody> and puts all the initialization in the BODY onLoad
[14:43:14] <jedimind_> duanemoody, you think thats bad ?
[14:43:36] <aaronmcadam> i just removed a stupid thing from an app that included the same version twice because a "plugin" used noConflict and the guys didn't know how to fix it
[14:43:41] <jedimind_> http://yvettesbridalformal.com/
[14:43:44] <jedimind_> best
[14:43:45] <jedimind_> website
[14:43:46] <jedimind_> ever.
[14:43:55] <duanemoody> i didn't say ugly
[14:44:04] <duanemoody> the page looks good
[14:44:08] <r3pek> jedimind_, isn't that the same thing as css user-select: none?
[14:44:11] <duanemoody> but it won't load on a DSL connection
[14:44:27] <jedimind_> r3pek, not entirely, user-select doesnt always do the trick properly
[14:44:28] <aaronmcadam> is that standard css tho r3pek
[14:44:49] <aaronmcadam> might need vendor specific rules
[14:44:52] <r3pek> aaronmcadam, i know :) i have all the variants :)
[14:45:00] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[14:45:13] <aaronmcadam> sass mixins ftw :)
[14:45:15] <r3pek> but the background is still getting selected :/
[14:45:37] <r3pek> let me try jedimind_'s version
[14:46:02] <aaronmcadam> hmm you'd have to use fbug/web inspector to check browser styles
[14:47:09] <aaronmcadam> funny thing about chrome's web inspector is that u can inspect the inspector itself :D
[14:47:53] <r3pek> aaronmcadam, true :)
[14:48:01] <r3pek> jedimind_, still the same problem
[14:48:06] <r3pek> wanna look @ code?
[14:48:48] <jedimind_> not particularily, but if you post a jsfiddle, someone will look im sure :)
[14:49:30] <CodeZombie> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/vPe5w/2/

[14:53:19] <solidus-river> is there a way to tell if there is already a function on setTimeout?
[14:53:30] <solidus-river> ie, before i set a new timeout on a function, see if there is already one in the queue?
[14:53:34] <Typh> How can I figure out where in my code a certain error is happening? Rather than jquery-1.5.1.min.js:16 with some other jquery stuff on the call stack. (chrome)
[14:54:00] <eddiemonge> solidus-river: you have it backwards, you can do var timer = setTimeout()
[14:54:22] <solidus-river> eddiemonge: damn so i'm guessing if i don't keep a reference to the timer there is no way
[14:54:31] <eddiemonge> right
[14:54:32] <CodeZombie> aaronmcadam: here's a cleaned up version http://jsfiddle.net/vPe5w/6/
[14:54:44] <solidus-river> eddiemonge: whats the way with the timer reference kept?
[14:55:17] <eddiemonge> huh? timer becomes the reference to the setTimeout so you can use clearTimeout
[14:55:49] <solidus-river> interesting
[14:58:10] <solidus-river> is it preffered to check for variable instantiation by using != null or typof(variable) == "undefined"
[14:58:48] <aaronmcadam> solidus-river: neither
[14:58:56] <aaronmcadam> simply
[14:59:00] <aaronmcadam> if ( var )
[14:59:00] <r3pek> if (var)
[14:59:09] <aaronmcadam> var && doSomethingWithVar

[15:01:48] <Koenigsegg> Hi. Any common pitfalls that would make .animate(), .fadeIn() and similar fail? The element exists, I'm doing $('...').hide().appendTo('body').fadeIn(300) . But it seems the animation doesn't happen, when I view the element in firebug opacity is still at 0 or close to it.
[15:02:05] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var x = {}; x.prop || 'no x.prop';
[15:02:06] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "no x.prop"
[15:02:13] <aaronmcadam> there we go
[15:03:03] <rhizmoe> is there extra massage necessary when retrieving json with .ajax? I'm getting a parseerror
[15:03:05] <aaronmcadam> how can u hide the element before it's part of the dom Koenigsegg
[15:03:15] <rhizmoe> aaronmcadam: css
[15:03:20] <rhizmoe> hide it by default
[15:03:24] <eddiemonge> Koenigsegg: jsfiddle example or live site?
[15:03:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah I kno but I meant
[15:03:35] <HardPhuck> can i observe an input field for changes while a user types in?
[15:03:35] <aaronmcadam> I was pointing out hide shouldn't effect it
[15:03:48] <aaronmcadam> but then it might just add the css
[15:04:01] <aaronmcadam> HardPhuck: see ?keyup

[15:04:46] <HardPhuck> working
[15:04:49] <simple__> ive got an issue with my post data being empty when submitted to the server when i do: $(form).submit(function(){$.post($(this).attr('action'), function(html) {$(div).html(html);}) return false; });   wjats the deal?
[15:04:51] <rhizmoe> eddiemonge: the json passes
[15:04:55] <aaronmcadam> bind to both to be sure HardPhuck
[15:04:57] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: .hide() before adding to the dom is valid
[15:05:08] <aaronmcadam> yeah it should add the css props on
[15:05:12] <HardPhuck> ok
[15:05:33] <eddiemonge> simple__: you arent submitting any data
[15:05:40] <Koenigsegg> aaronmcadam: Well.. Somehow it works, because that's the only way the element can get that close to 0 opacity. Good point though ;)
[15:05:40] <eddiemonge> ?post @ simple__

[15:06:11] <aaronmcadam> I dunno why no clarification on having to call hide() before fadeIn() has happened
[15:06:16] <eddiemonge> Koenigsegg: then jsfiddle it?

[15:07:13] <aaronmcadam> ?ask @ enjoycrf :P
[15:07:14] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Couldn't find "ask @ enjoycrf :P" in jQuery Docs.
[15:07:18] <Koenigsegg> aaronmcadam: Seems to work best. It's either that or opacity: 0 in CSS to hide it.
[15:07:18] <aaronmcadam> ?ask @ enjoycrf
[15:07:19] <bot-t> enjoycrf, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:07:27] <Koenigsegg> eddiemonge: Ok, one sec
[15:07:37] <enjoycrf> whats the difrence between using this.method() and classname.method()
[15:07:48] <aaronmcadam> jimubao: probably means there's no jQuery
[15:07:59] <aaronmcadam> or you're not wrapping your object in $()
[15:08:14] <aaronmcadam> fiddle fiddle fiddle :D
[15:08:27] <jimubao> aaronmcadam: like method hasClass is not found ?
[15:08:47] <aaronmcadam> enjoycrf: the "this" keyword is a reference to the contextual object
[15:08:58] <enjoycrf> wats the diff
[15:09:08] <eddiemonge> rhizmoe: did you run it through jsonlint.com? i dont think the trailing comma is valid
[15:09:24] <aaronmcadam> enjoycrf: just read this https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/this
[15:09:25] <rhizmoe> oh balls
[15:09:35] <simple__> eddiemonge: i'm confused then, i copied the code from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/569595/form-submission-within-thickbox which says it does submit
[15:09:38] <enjoycrf> cant u jus tel me
[15:09:42] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[15:09:48] <aaronmcadam> do u code in any other languages?
[15:09:55] <enjoycrf> yah
[15:09:59] <aaronmcadam> which ones
[15:10:05] <enjoycrf> most of em
[15:10:10] <aaronmcadam> what's most?
[15:10:19] <simple__> thus it would be :"  $.post($(this).attr('action'), data, function(html) { ??
[15:10:37] <aaronmcadam> ....
[15:10:45] <eddiemonge> simple__: and you just copy and paste every little thing on the internet?
[15:10:46] <aaronmcadam> ruby? python? php???
[15:10:51] <enjoycrf> php
[15:10:55] <enjoycrf> python
[15:10:57] <aaronmcadam> and you never use this?
[15:10:59] <aaronmcadam> or self?
[15:11:01] <enjoycrf> i d
[15:11:02] <enjoycrf> o
[15:11:06] <enjoycrf> i said wats the diff?
[15:11:07] <aaronmcadam> self being a reference to the class instance?
[15:11:28] <simple__> hah not exactly, i read it first, then paste :-P    no i customize it to do what i need
[15:11:37] <aaronmcadam> it depends what u mean by your "classname".method
[15:11:43] <enjoycrf> ok
[15:11:48] <aaronmcadam> what do u mean?
[15:11:49] <eddiemonge> ?serialize @ simple__
[15:11:50] <bot-t> simple__, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[15:11:50] <enjoycrf> i make a class
[15:11:54] <enjoycrf> like this
[15:12:08] <aaronmcadam> js is classless but ok :)
[15:12:09] <enjoycrf> var myclass = { }
[15:12:12] <aaronmcadam> right yeah
[15:12:23] <enjoycrf> and inside i have vars name,
[15:12:28] <enjoycrf> so its myclass.name
[15:12:29] <aaronmcadam> yes
[15:12:34] <aaronmcadam> right yeah
[15:12:36] <enjoycrf> so inside that class
[15:12:40] <aaronmcadam> it's to do with scoping in that instance
[15:12:43] <enjoycrf> i can either go this.name
[15:12:46] <enjoycrf> or myclass.name
[15:12:47] <aaronmcadam> inside that class u want this.name
[15:12:50] <enjoycrf> both work
[15:12:54] <aaronmcadam> and outside it you want myclass.name
[15:12:55] <johnbender> anyone know if setting an attribute value with an encoded or unencoded script tag will result in execution of the script in any browsers?
[15:13:06] <enjoycrf> ya but both work
[15:13:10] <enjoycrf> so wats the diff
[15:13:13] <eddiemonge> enjoycrf: read JavaScript Patterns and you'll learn the difference?
[15:13:22] <enjoycrf> jus tel me
[15:13:23] <enjoycrf> plz
[15:13:30] <aaronmcadam> ur being a bit of dick here dude
[15:13:39] <aaronmcadam> this is just a reference
[15:13:41] <enjoycrf> ok bye
[15:13:54] <aaronmcadam> so in the context, classname is pretty much the same thing as this
[15:14:04] <aaronmcadam> and scoping applies too
[15:14:14] <enjoycrf> anyone disagree
[15:14:17] <enjoycrf> ?
[15:14:33] <aaronmcadam> but it's *not* the same thing
[15:14:34] <enjoycrf> what does in context mean?
[15:14:49] <aaronmcadam> "In general, a function's this is set by how a function is called, it can't be changed afterward, and can be different each time the function is called. "
[15:14:50] <eddiemonge> omg!
[15:14:52] <enjoycrf> inside the class?
[15:15:00] <aaronmcadam> context and scoping in js
[15:15:01] <aaronmcadam> google that
[15:15:10] <aaronmcadam> here let me even do it for u
[15:15:11] <aaronmcadam> lol
[15:15:16] <enjoycrf> but u cant use this outside the class
[15:15:19] <aaronmcadam> ?g context and scoping in js @ enjoycrf
[15:15:21] <bot-t> enjoycrf, Digital Web Magazine - Scope in JavaScript - http://www.digital-web.com/articles/scope_in_javascript/
[15:15:22] <enjoycrf> do it doesnt mater
[15:15:27] <enjoycrf> so
[15:15:28] <aaronmcadam> of course u can;t
[15:15:35] <aaronmcadam> this outside of ur class is the window object
[15:15:42] <enjoycrf> rite
[15:15:46] <aaronmcadam> this is very important
[15:15:50] <aaronmcadam> to understand
[15:15:50] <enjoycrf> so using this.
[15:15:55] <enjoycrf> and classname. is the same
[15:15:58] <aaronmcadam> no
[15:16:04] <aaronmcadam> only inside your class lol
[15:16:10] <enjoycrf> i kno
[15:16:10] <enjoycrf> lol
[15:16:18] <enjoycrf> it wont work otherwise
[15:16:27] <enjoycrf> im bringing this up because->
[15:16:29] <aaronmcadam> this.a = window.a = 37
[15:16:32] <aaronmcadam> will return 37
[15:16:42] <enjoycrf> poeple do var self = this;
[15:16:44] <aaronmcadam> yes
[15:16:48] <aaronmcadam> that's for callbacks
[15:16:52] <enjoycrf> and i avoid that by just using the classname
[15:16:58] <aaronmcadam> so that self is a reference to the outer context
[15:17:06] <aaronmcadam> right cool
[15:17:10] <enjoycrf> not just call backs but any function
[15:17:18] <enjoycrf> which will override this
[15:17:21] <enjoycrf> w itself
[15:17:21] <aaronmcadam> that's why u use the pattern
[15:17:34] <enjoycrf> wats the pattern
[15:17:55] <amid_hasan> how do I add a method parameter into a url with a jsonp callback?
[15:17:59] <aaronmcadam> var self = this; $().click( function () { self.blah(); });
[15:18:11] <enjoycrf> yah i dont like having extra lines
[15:18:22] <amid_hasan> i currently have: http://somesite.com/?method=doThis&jsonpcallback=?
[15:18:30] <aaronmcadam> because inside that callback function, this no longer is equal to the this that's a reference to className
[15:18:31] <enjoycrf> and i dint want to create million instances of the same class
[15:18:37] <enjoycrf> like some ppl do in php
[15:18:38] <amid_hasan> i need to add a paremeter in the url which references the method
[15:18:38] <aaronmcadam> god this is like rewriting the docs
[15:18:53] <aaronmcadam> what are you talking about recreating?
[15:19:03] <enjoycrf> like ppl do
[15:19:05] <aaronmcadam> this is reference to the instance
[15:19:08] <aaronmcadam> the object
[15:19:10] <enjoycrf> $db = new db();
[15:19:14] <aaronmcadam> right yeah
[15:19:20] <enjoycrf> but in a new page
[15:19:28] <enjoycrf> or i mean inside a new function
[15:19:28] <Koenigsegg> eddiemonge: Well, making that create element/fadeIn() call seems to work in jsfiddle. Irritating. But I don't get why the opacity doesn't change on the actual page then?? Only difference that I've found is jquery 1.5.2 on jsfiddle and 1.5.1 on the page.
[15:19:34] <enjoycrf> they do that again
[15:19:34] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:19:35] <enjoycrf> lol
[15:19:39] <enjoycrf> dumass
[15:19:47] <enjoycrf> its like this
[15:19:50] <aaronmcadam> that's cuz a lot of php coders are just starting out
[15:19:54] <enjoycrf> global $db;
[15:19:58] <aaronmcadam> ah god yeah
[15:20:01] <Koenigsegg> (Thatnks for hinting about jsfiddle btw, forgot about that one *hide*)
[15:20:19] <aaronmcadam> namespace collisions ftw
[15:20:21] <enjoycrf> i built a 3d engine in just 2 months
[15:20:26] <enjoycrf> so i kno some stuff
[15:20:33] <eddiemonge> Koenigsegg: upgrade your code then?
[15:20:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah, php is like js, there's an awful lot of shit code out there
[15:20:41] <enjoycrf> but im always asking again just to optimize u kno
[15:20:55] <Dave_Stein> aaronmcadam: all languages have an awful lot of shit code out there :)
[15:20:58] <aaronmcadam> try reading that article i linked to
[15:21:04] <enjoycrf> i also dont use .live
[15:21:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah but it's particularly bad with js and php Dave_Stein
[15:21:15] <enjoycrf> i jus place my callbacks properly
[15:21:17] <aaronmcadam> me neither
[15:21:19] <enjoycrf> do u think thats beter
[15:21:20] <aaronmcadam> i use delegate
[15:21:28] <enjoycrf> i dont use del either
[15:21:31] <Dave_Stein> .live is faster than .bind
[15:21:31] <aaronmcadam> eh placing callbacks won't delegate the event
[15:21:38] <enjoycrf> i jus have a million nested callbaks
[15:21:41] <Dave_Stein> .delegate uses the same concept as .live
[15:21:41] <aaronmcadam> delegate is best over all of them
[15:21:46] <aaronmcadam> and the new on/off api is awesome
[15:21:52] <aaronmcadam> delegate adds context
[15:22:01] <aaronmcadam> so it's faster
[15:22:17] <enjoycrf> id rather nest my code properly
[15:22:19] <aaronmcadam> but that aside, on/off is the new unified api
[15:22:23] <enjoycrf> than have jQ help me
[15:22:29] <aaronmcadam> what are u talking about nesting won't delegate your events properly
[15:22:33] <Dave_Stein> .delegate would be slower since it needs to check the context rather than just going with event, since its based on event bubbling to very top
[15:22:36] <aaronmcadam> for ajax content
[15:22:38] <enjoycrf> sure does
[15:22:48] <Dave_Stein> he means he nests a lot of callbacks that then use bind in the right order, i think
[15:22:51] <eddiemonge> Dave_Stein: lol you are funny
[15:22:52] <aaronmcadam> ah jesus
[15:23:05] <enjoycrf> ya
[15:23:09] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: delegate /is/ faster I remember the blog posts about it
[15:23:15] <enjoycrf> i also dont use bind
[15:23:20] <enjoycrf> i use the shortcuts
[15:23:22] <aaronmcadam> don't tell me you're rebinding click events in your callbacks
[15:23:22] <Dave_Stein> aaronmcadam crap i have to go read that
[15:23:28] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: im pretty sure Dave_Stein was being sarcastic
[15:23:38] <enjoycrf> something like that
[15:23:39] <aaronmcadam> I dunno
[15:23:42] <enjoycrf> but i only have one
[15:23:43] <aaronmcadam> don't do that
[15:23:46] <enjoycrf> of each
[15:23:59] <aaronmcadam> great... haha
[15:24:13] <enjoycrf> u mean the code does tho
[15:24:17] <aaronmcadam> only one of each unmaintainable pieces of code replication
[15:24:18] <eddiemonge> .bind() > .click() > .delegate() > .live(). Fastest to slowest
[15:24:22] <geekbri> i wouldn't compare delegate to live
[15:24:29] <geekbri> and also i wouldn't ever USE live
[15:24:40] <Dave_Stein> eddiemonge isnt that backwards based on aaronmcadam
[15:24:44] <eddiemonge> no
[15:24:48] <enjoycrf> ya i jus thot thers something funy w live
[15:24:49] <aaronmcadam> point is, the new event api should solve these issues
[15:24:59] <aaronmcadam> so sick of explaining why delegate is the best
[15:25:01] <enjoycrf> hahaha
[15:25:05] <geekbri> if youre using live you should be using delegate
[15:25:07] <enjoycrf> so ill jus stik to my way
[15:25:08] <eddiemonge> click is a shortcut to .bind('click')
[15:25:16] <enjoycrf> thats how i do it
[15:25:17] <eddiemonge> geekbri: not always
[15:25:23] <geekbri> ALMOST always
[15:25:31] <enjoycrf> onsuccess: function ( $().click() )
[15:25:33] <aaronmcadam> yeah go against conventions built up by people who wrote the library you're using, go figure enjoycrf
[15:25:37] <eddiemonge> exactly, ALMOST always but not always
[15:25:41] <danzik17> eddiemonge: When would you use live over delegate?
[15:25:45] <enjoycrf> onsuccess: function ( $().click() )
[15:25:47] <enjoycrf> wats so bad
[15:26:04] <eddiemonge> when im targeting a direct child of body
[15:26:05] <aaronmcadam> rescoping madness
[15:26:09] <aaronmcadam> weeee
[15:26:17] <enjoycrf> how
[15:26:20] <amid_hasan> how to i capture a url parameter using jquery and put it into a variable?
[15:26:20] <aaronmcadam> can't u just do it the right way and forget about it?
[15:26:24] <enjoycrf> its diff content
[15:26:40] <eddiemonge> amid_hasan: window.location
[15:26:53] <amid_hasan> lets say i have page.html?id=123
[15:27:01] <amid_hasan> i need to capture "123"
[15:27:06] <amid_hasan> value of id key
[15:27:13] <aaronmcadam> amid_hasan: document.location.search amid_hasan
[15:27:20] <aaronmcadam> also, see ?bbq
[15:27:21] <bot-t> also, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[15:27:32] <aaronmcadam> its deparam method is what u want amid_hasan
[15:27:41] <aaronmcadam> only 4k minified so go for it
[15:27:56] <amid_hasan> does document.location.search work in all browsers?
[15:27:56] <aaronmcadam> amid_hasan: $.deparam.queryString()
[15:28:02] <Dave_Stein> god damn i can only see articles about delegate vs live on 1.4.2
[15:28:06] <enjoycrf> im weird huh
[15:28:14] <aaronmcadam> yeah but you'll have to deserialize it, just use the plugin amid_hasan
[15:28:44] <aaronmcadam> $.deparam.queryString() will return u an object like this: { id : 123 }
[15:28:45] <aaronmcadam> simple
[15:28:47] <eddiemonge> Dave_Stein: .live() basically calls .delegate('body', 'event')
[15:29:11] <Dave_Stein> "There is one more difference in terms of performance, if the context is not specified with the live function. Context means you are setting the search limit within a specific node. If you don't specify the context with live function then it attaches the handler to the document by default and when executed it traverse through the DOM which causes a performance issue. "
[15:29:29] <aaronmcadam> bingo
[15:30:01] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: more perf stuff: http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-performance-tips-2011/
[15:30:28] <Dave_Stein> bookmarked that for later
[15:31:36] <Dave_Stein> i was under the impression that if it bound to the document, it just waited for the bubble and then checked event.target against what you wanted.... but i forgot that jquery is also traversing so that if you click #child inside #parent, it knows that it should count it as #parent if you bound to that
[15:31:39] <Dave_Stein> that make sense?
[15:31:41] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: this was the one I meant: http://addyosmani.com/jqprovenperformance/
[15:32:15] <aaronmcadam> Sizzle checks that #child is a child of #parent Dave_Stein
[15:32:26] <aaronmcadam> that link I just posted explains it
[15:32:35] <aaronmcadam> selectors, like css selectors, are parsed right to left
[15:32:55] <Dave_Stein> know the slide number? :)
[15:33:03] <aaronmcadam> which is why selectors like $( 'ul#id li.className') are bad
[15:33:12] <aaronmcadam> in both langs
[15:33:25] <aaronmcadam> if something has an id, don't qualify it with another selector
[15:33:41] <aaronmcadam> for which point Dan-H
[15:33:43] <aaronmcadam> for which point Dave_Stein
[15:33:49] <larzen-wrk1> folks, i want to execute a setInterval function from within JQuery UI class.. for some reason, however, it seems to go nuts!  setInterval( function(e) {me.OnEvent()'}, 5000 );
[15:33:51] <Dave_Stein> so since delegate is using sizzle, and sizzle is traversing  for $('.el').live() vs $('#table').delegate('.el').. the first one will traverse up to document but second will stop at table?
[15:34:03] <aaronmcadam> yes
[15:34:14] <aaronmcadam> one gotcha
[15:34:23] <larzen-wrk1> can someone suggest how to execute a timer function from within a jquery / jquery UI class?
[15:34:30] <aaronmcadam> you need to make sure that that #table is not replaced by your callback
[15:34:31] <Dave_Stein> you are probably setting multiple intervals larzen-wrk1 :)
[15:34:39] <Dave_Stein> ?jsfiddle @ larzen-wrk1
[15:34:39] <bot-t> larzen-wrk1, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[15:34:56] <CodeZombie> aaronmcadam: did you get a chance to look at http://jsfiddle.net/vPe5w/6/ ?
[15:34:57] <Dave_Stein> right, meaning that on an ajax call i shuold only ever be replacing the contents of #table
[15:34:59] <Dave_Stein> not the #table tag itself
[15:35:01] <aaronmcadam> I've got a fiddle for mocking ajax requests btw if u want it
[15:35:10] <aaronmcadam> yes Dave_Stein
[15:35:20] <larzen-wrk1> Dave_Stein how would I know?
[15:35:29] <aaronmcadam> lol
[15:35:35] <aaronmcadam> ?ftjq @ larzen-wrk1
[15:35:36] <bot-t> larzen-wrk1, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[15:35:38] <Dave_Stein> larzen-work1 at the most basic level, you shold console log before set interval and see if youre calling that more than once :)
[15:35:47] <aaronmcadam> read that site larzen-wrk1
[15:36:34] <Dave_Stein> got it all now :) i realize why i had the wrong assumption
[15:37:04] <Dave_Stein> if i used native js to track events that hit the document via bubbling, i wouldnt have sizzle, hence i would only respond to clicks on #parent and #child would be screwing me
[15:37:18] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: slide 62
[15:38:01] <Dave_Stein> thank you sir
[15:38:12] <aaronmcadam> delegate is also useful when binding to multiple elements, rather than bla.each(function(){ this.click....)
[15:38:18] <danzik17> even if bubbling is/was slightly slower, the cleaner and more managable code is worth it imo
[15:38:36] <aaronmcadam> live/die is pretty much deprecated
[15:38:49] <aaronmcadam> on/off is the new api, looking forward to using it
[15:39:27] <Dave_Stein> when does that come out? 1.7?
[15:39:41] <Dave_Stein> i hate huge api changes... how the hell am i supposed to get that to all my sites? so much code haha
[15:39:49] <aaronmcadam> well it's only at beta1 could check the github issues and check the milestones
[15:39:58] <aaronmcadam> live/die won't be removed
[15:40:19] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: the old API is still supported, they're just encouraging people to use the new stuff
[15:40:21] <aaronmcadam> too many devs jumped on it
[15:40:31] <Dave_Stein> yeah i know but then i hate that the old stuff is there and will be there for years :)
[15:40:44] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:40:52] <aaronmcadam> that's legacy code for ye
[15:40:56] <Dave_Stein> ha that jsperf was misleading a second that $("table").delegate is slower than document.body delegate
[15:41:02] <Dave_Stein> i was reading it was #table :)
[15:41:18] <aaronmcadam> kk
[15:41:34] <Dave_Stein> ah well one of my biggest apps is being rewritten from scratch soon, so ill be sure to use delegate if 1.7 isnt out yet
[15:41:58] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: an id selector is always going to be the fastest
[15:42:08] <Dave_Stein> yup
[15:42:30] <Dave_Stein> it was weird that the selector with > repeatedly was faster than just td
[15:42:38] <aaronmcadam> slide 41 for selector tests
[15:42:57] <Dave_Stein> actually that was just weird on my machine
[15:42:59] <aaronmcadam> hmm sizzle does some optimisations
[15:43:01] <Dave_Stein> overall delegate from body is faster
[15:43:03] <Dave_Stein> as i thought it shuold be
[15:43:15] <Dave_Stein> on my comp for some reason body 2 ( the one with > ) was faster by a few ops
[15:43:18] <Dave_Stein> http://jsperf.com/jquery-delegate-vs-live-table-test/2
[15:43:54] <aaronmcadam> have a look at this, it's a good guide in general
[15:43:54] <aaronmcadam> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Writing_Efficient_CSS
[15:44:44] <Dave_Stein> im good with the CSS bit
[15:45:02] <aaronmcadam> yeah but it helps explain why some things are inefficient
[15:45:03] <Dave_Stein> esp after seeing whats her face speak at a conference haha errr the one who does "object oriented css"
[15:45:12] <aaronmcadam> ah i kno who u mean
[15:45:41] <aaronmcadam> lae verou or something?

[15:46:03] <MaxMeents> tired of dead ends, need help developing a javascript app., many componets need to work together before release, can't go in depth due to nature of project, have backing of someone willing to put in a lot of money, I need a programmer who need only know javascript and MAYBE php. Any ideas on how to go about finding this person in Nebraska? I worked a lot on it several months ago but burned myself out, about to start again but don't want to do it alone
[15:46:29] <aaronmcadam> that sorta thing doesn't work in here unfortunately see ?beg
[15:46:30] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Tutorials/Desired - All tutorials should be unobtrusive; emphasize unobtrusiveness in everything http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials/Desired
[15:46:33] <aaronmcadam> haha :LD
[15:47:04] <Dave_Stein> nah isnt it her: http://twitter.com/#!/stubbornella
[15:47:05] <socialhapy>  Tweet from stubbornella: @susanjrobertson truth be told, people are skeptical until they try it. They need to feel the freedom of building new pgs with existing lego  http://bit.ly/osTTxR
[15:47:06] <aaronmcadam> hmm you need to post on freelance boards MaxMeents
[15:47:27] <aaronmcadam> are you using sass then Dave_Stein
[15:47:32] <aaronmcadam> course u are :P
[15:47:57] <MaxMeents> good suggestion aaronmcadam, will do right now. any other ideas?
[15:48:18] <aaronmcadam> do u work for yourself?
[15:48:30] <jedimind_> are you master of your domain ?
[15:48:52] <enjoycrf> yes
[15:49:07] <aaronmcadam> enjoycrf is on his own domain entirely
[15:49:13] <enjoycrf> lol
[15:49:14] <aaronmcadam> he writes his own standards :D
[15:49:18] <enjoycrf> i kno
[15:49:38] <Dave_Stein> haha no im not
[15:49:46] <aaronmcadam> enjoycrf: "hundreds of thousands of people CAN be wrong ;)"
[15:49:49] <Dave_Stein> aaronmcadam my front end dev is really into LESS right now
[15:49:52] <enjoycrf> i showed john carmak how to do bsp collision
[15:50:02] <aaronmcadam> your "front end dev" can't help u?
[15:50:08] <aaronmcadam> then he's not a fuckin front end dev lol
[15:50:20] <Dave_Stein> she is the CSS/HTML girl :)
[15:50:25] <Koenigsegg> Doesn't .fadeIn() like position:fixed ?
[15:50:31] <aaronmcadam> that's not front end development
[15:50:33] <Dave_Stein> i can do PHP and JS but im moreso JS
[15:50:37] <Dave_Stein> she does JS too
[15:50:46] <aaronmcadam> why can't she help?
[15:50:52] <Dave_Stein> with which part? lol
[15:50:55] <aaronmcadam> you need to get someone in who knows what they're doing
[15:51:03] <enjoycrf> hahaha
[15:51:16] <aaronmcadam> which is a bit harder to find with js
[15:51:22] <Dave_Stein> im the JS guy haha
[15:51:31] <enjoycrf> i own at js
[15:51:39] <aaronmcadam> ok... so are u completely stuck?
[15:51:45] <aaronmcadam> what's been the biggest problem?
[15:51:48] <Dave_Stein> www.prosite.com all JS editor for building website
[15:52:00] <Dave_Stein> im not stuck on anything :) i was just confused about live being slower than delegate or not
[15:52:02] <enjoycrf> jquery taught me js surprisingly
[15:52:11] <aaronmcadam> ah shit I got confused lol
[15:52:15] <Dave_Stein> yeah haha
[15:52:22] <aaronmcadam> meant MaxMeents
[15:52:23] <aaronmcadam> lol
[15:52:23] <Dave_Stein> ive been doing JS for a long long long time
[15:52:26] <Dave_Stein> since before libraries
[15:52:33] <Dave_Stein> my first library use was prototype and then ext lol
[15:52:37] <Dave_Stein> thank god for jquery
[15:52:38] <aaronmcadam> sorry Dave_Stein it's late here lol :D
[15:52:38] <enjoycrf> i didnt even know all this js functionality existed before i started doing jqueery
[15:52:43] <aaronmcadam> oh got protoshit :D
[15:52:44] <Dave_Stein> haha its ok
[15:52:48] <simple__> is there a jquery goto url ?   sorta like im doing $(body).html(html) to render into a box, cant i just tell the thickbox to goto a url with params?
[15:52:49] <enjoycrf> me too
[15:52:56] <enjoycrf> i used to use prototype
[15:53:17] <aaronmcadam> "js can show/hide divs, omgggg"
[15:53:18] <enjoycrf> i had no clue js was OOP
[15:53:35] <aaronmcadam> haha I remember this dickhead kept sayin "no, it's object-/based/"
[15:53:36] <coldhead> i'm not sure it is, enjoycrf
[15:53:37] <aaronmcadam> like wtf is that
[15:53:41] <aaronmcadam> yes it is!
[15:53:51] <aaronmcadam> coldhead: bad pupil :P
[15:53:56] <enjoycrf> ya bad
[15:54:19] <coldhead> if it's so object oriented why do i keep typing "function" and not "object" or "class" or "new"
[15:54:23] <Dave_Stein> meanwhile im dying right now, hold on i gotta finish up this damn PHP API thing im doing
[15:54:25] <Dave_Stein> for my site
[15:54:25] <Dave_Stein> :)
[15:54:25] <aaronmcadam> like what the fuck is object based but object oriented lol
[15:54:26] <Dave_Stein> brb
[15:54:30] <aaronmcadam> what?
[15:54:43] <enjoycrf> its just a diff syntac
[15:54:47] <aaronmcadam> coldhead: js uses something called the Document OBJECT Model...
[15:54:53] <solidus-river> is there a way to test if a div is visible or not?
[15:55:10] <coldhead> YOU'RE AN OBJECT, AARONMCADAM
[15:55:12] <coldhead> I OBJECT
[15:55:20] <nathanw_> hey everyone
[15:55:20] <coldhead> YOU ALL SUCK
[15:55:26] <aaronmcadam> coldhead: you probably use literals for creating objects instead of explicitly creating them
[15:55:40] <aaronmcadam> which is the best way
[15:56:12] <aaronmcadam> explicit object creation is slow, literals are preferred and so sayeth Sir Crockford
[15:56:54] <aaronmcadam> ?:visible @ solidus-river
[15:56:55] <bot-t> solidus-river, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[15:57:10] <aaronmcadam> so is(':visible')
[15:57:19] <aaronmcadam> will return whether or not it is solidus-river
[15:57:59] <solidus-river> and i filter will filter all but the visible ones out :)
[15:58:00] <solidus-river> cool
[15:58:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah try and limit it down
[15:58:16] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:58:19] <aaronmcadam> inside the filter cb
[15:58:30] <aaronmcadam> return $(this).is(':visible') solidus-river
[15:58:43] <aaronmcadam> that will give u a set of the visible els, bam
[15:59:24] <coldhead> crockford was a fatty
[15:59:47] <aaronmcadam> *was*?
[15:59:48] <aaronmcadam> heh
[15:59:52] <coldhead> :D
[16:00:08] <aaronmcadam> he looks sexy here: http://badassjs.com/
[16:00:13] <aaronmcadam> right column
[16:00:33] <aaronmcadam> pity that tumblr hasn't been updated in ages :(
[16:00:35] <aaronmcadam> used to be good
[16:01:34] <Phrogz> Say I have   $('.fifteenhundreditems').each(function(){ $(this)[ foo() ? 'show' : 'hide' ]() });    Does anyone have data on whether it is faster (for the browser) if I instead did        .each( function(){ $this.toggleClass( 'hidden', foo() ) } );?
[16:02:01] <kanzie> is there any way to have jsDoc generate a printer-friendly document?
[16:02:10] <solidus-river> aaronmcadam: thansk :)
[16:02:11] <Phrogz> (The jQuery portion of showing/hiding the 1500 items is only 50ms...the browser portion of applying it is much slower. I'm wondering if CSS class-based show/hide is any nicer on the browser.)
[16:02:20] <juha_> ugh, i have some issues binding jquery ui datepicker to dynamically created element. datepicker adds hasDatepicker class and dpTIMESTAMP id to it, but doesn't seem to fire.. do i need to tell it to insert some other id or something?
[16:02:28] <aaronmcadam> working solidus-river ?
[16:02:46] <aaronmcadam> holy shit
[16:03:14] <solidus-river> I'm still designing how i want to aproach
[16:03:27] <aaronmcadam> cool
[16:03:43] <juha_> Phrogz: try putting your 1500 items inside a single element and then hiding that element, should speed up
[16:03:48] <aaronmcadam> fucking hell Phrogz that's crazy. use toggleClass yeah
[16:04:09] <aaronmcadam> that way you're not mutating the dom as much
[16:04:27] <aaronmcadam> but still the browser will reflow I spose
[16:04:43] <aaronmcadam> you should probably show/hide them in batches maybe
[16:05:01] <aaronmcadam> juha_: are u using delegate?
[16:05:29] <juha_> aaronmcadam: delegate on binding datepicker to input? is that possible?
[16:05:52] <aaronmcadam> hmmm
[16:06:18] <aaronmcadam> you'd probably have to bind in your callback if you're not already
[16:06:22] <juha_> aaronmcadam: i have "add another date" link that dynamically creatrs another input, after that i'm binding datepicker to that
[16:06:27] <juha_> sec
[16:06:40] <juha_> http://pastie.org/2640772
[16:06:46] <aaronmcadam> right so u want individual datepickers
[16:06:51] <aaronmcadam> pah, jsfiddle brooo
[16:06:58] <aaronmcadam> pastie is so like static n shit :P
[16:07:18] <juha_> yeah, it just was the first url that popped into my mind :P
[16:07:41] <juha_> i've been trying to google for solution..
[16:08:00] <Phrogz> juha_: I have to show/hide them individually.
[16:08:06] <juha_> i'm thinking that it doesn't work because it adds duplicate id's to all input elements
[16:08:40] <juha_> Phrogz: that sucks.. maybe the toggleClass will be faster than toggle
[16:09:14] <Phrogz> juha_: Perhaps; hope so. I suppose I'll give it a shot, in the absence of any hard data.
[16:09:17] <nathanw_> hey, can anyone help me... i just need to take the value of 1 in put and multiply it by the value of another and output it to an input.   input x input = value
[16:09:43] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: wow didn't kno u were head of behance :D
[16:09:46] <nathanw_> need to do it on key up when the user enters value x into one of the fields the total will be calculated
[16:09:52] <Dave_Stein> aaronmcadam: you know us?
[16:09:58] <aaronmcadam> heard of u guys before
[16:10:05] <aaronmcadam> never really went on the site much tho
[16:10:07] <Dave_Stein> haha cool
[16:10:16] <Dave_Stein> well the way people build projects is all drag and drop crazyness, the first version was native JS only
[16:10:17] <aaronmcadam> think the Gallery is where i would have see in
[16:10:20] <aaronmcadam> it*
[16:10:22] <Dave_Stein> yeah def
[16:10:35] <juha_> nathanw_: $(".resultInput").val($(".inputOne").val() * $(".inputTwo").val());
[16:10:36] <aaronmcadam> ah
[16:10:43] <aaronmcadam> you guys are the ones with the fun like button :D
[16:10:55] <aaronmcadam> way before facebook had it too :D
[16:10:59] <nathanw_> juha_: thanks!!!! I'll have a go with that
[16:11:26] <Dave_Stein> haha you mean appreciate it?
[16:11:29] <juha_> nathanw_: you should also check that there is some values on those inputs
[16:11:30] <aaronmcadam> well yeah
[16:11:33] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[16:11:33] <aaronmcadam> hell*
[16:11:42] <ProLoser|Work> where can i find an example of creating a base object/class and then creating another one that extends it?
[16:11:53] <aaronmcadam> well glad I could help out a pro :D
[16:11:57] <nathanw_> juha: thanks, how do I make it do that on key up  ?
[16:12:11] <coldhead> can i borrow a feeling?
[16:12:23] <ProLoser|Work> coldhead: i rent em out
[16:12:27] <Dave_Stein> yeah its funny i use jquery all day but sometimes i miss out on nitpicky stuff of minor optimizations etc
[16:12:27] <aaronmcadam> ProLoser|Work: you mean $.extend?
[16:12:31] <juha_> nathanw_: bind that calculation in ?keyup
[16:12:34] <juha_> hmm
[16:12:46] <Dave_Stein> ive been hanging in here about am onth though so picking up stuff like $.proxy which i didnt know about
[16:12:54] <juha_> ?keyup @ nathanw_
[16:12:54] <bot-t> nathanw_, .keyup(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[16:12:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah I spend all day working out why people have written js so badly
[16:13:06] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah
[16:13:09] <aaronmcadam> $.noop is another
[16:13:18] <ProLoser|Work> aaronmcadam: is that the same as doing object1.prototype.function = whatever?
[16:13:20] <aaronmcadam> if you have a callback that could be empty
[16:13:27] <juha_> coldhead: i've been missing you!
[16:13:30] <aaronmcadam> ?extend @ ProLoser|Work
[16:13:30] <Dave_Stein> the site im reworking from scratch, the framework im making for it matches the one we do in PHP so all our code here is gonna be easy to read like crazy
[16:13:31] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[16:13:44] <nathanw_> juha: like this ? $('.qty').click(function() {   $(".total").val($(".rate").val() * $(".qty").val()); });
[16:13:57] <Dave_Stein> yeah yeah $.noop i never use that stuffs, i know prototype had them allover
[16:14:05] <aaronmcadam> hmm I'm in the process of writing a framework myself
[16:14:06] <juha_> nathanw_: yes, if you want to bind it into the click event
[16:14:07] <Dave_Stein> i usually just check for typeof function rather than running empty function
[16:14:15] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:14:16] <Dave_Stein> i was just talking to ajpiano about it the other day
[16:14:22] <Dave_Stein> we both have our own modifications of what backbone.js does
[16:14:27] <nathanw_> juha: sorry this here: http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[16:14:30] <Dave_Stein> but he keeps MVC in same file whereas i break them int o their own files
[16:14:34] <enjoycrf> ok this might be too much but can u do this
[16:14:38] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: callback && typeof callback === 'function' && callback()
[16:14:39] <enjoycrf> function(content) {
[16:14:41] <aaronmcadam> that's what i use
[16:14:47] <enjoycrf> function(myclass.content) {
[16:14:56] <juha_> nathanw_: you should make sure that value is numeric, for eample like this: var value1 = Number($(".inputOne").val());
[16:15:09] <Dave_Stein> well if you look at doc for $.oop it shows that its useful for optional callbacks in plugins
[16:15:14] <aaronmcadam> yes
[16:15:29] <Dave_Stein> but id do if ( typeof options.callback === 'function' ) { options.callback(); }
[16:15:37] <aaronmcadam> effectively it's just "function() { return; }"
[16:15:37] <Dave_Stein> where callback would default to null
[16:15:41] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[16:15:45] <aaronmcadam> yeah, u don't need the if there tho
[16:15:46] <nathanw_> juha: would it be better to restrict the input to numbers only?
[16:15:47] <Dave_Stein> but its strange to make a function just for that to me
[16:15:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah a bit
[16:15:56] <nathanw_> rather than checking for numbers and throwing an error if there's letters, etc
[16:15:58] <juha_> nathanw_: indeed
[16:16:05] <Dave_Stein> you know why its there?
[16:16:12] <Dave_Stein> in the world of jquery programmers who the hell knows what typeof is offhand
[16:16:17] <aaronmcadam> Dan-H:  callback && typeof callback === 'function' && callback(); you don't need an if wrapping it
[16:16:18] <Dave_Stein> too many people dont learn JS before going to jquery
[16:16:22] <nathanw_> juha: so, i can finish this part of the argument and then restrict inputs to numbers later
[16:16:23] <aaronmcadam> yupyup
[16:16:33] <Dave_Stein> you keep getting Dan-H from misclicking something
[16:16:35] <aaronmcadam> typeof is a language construct
[16:16:43] <aaronmcadam> yeah I'm using autocomplete lol
[16:17:15] <aaronmcadam> i guess it's a bit easier for them
[16:17:19] <Dave_Stein> i'd rather use the if statement to be much clearer. using that one line is "easier" but stranger to read cause it looks like an if but is also reading
[16:17:41] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: to just write: callback() || $.noop()
[16:17:45] <Dave_Stein> and then when you come aroudn and want to use .appy or something like that you gotta rewrite that line anyway :)
[16:17:56] <Dave_Stein> true
[16:17:57] <aaronmcadam> that's true
[16:18:06] <Dave_Stein> fuck running a function for no reason lol
[16:18:11] <Dave_Stein> i dont care if it does nothing :)
[16:18:20] <nathanw_> Juha you there still ?
[16:18:25] <aaronmcadam> yeah I guess the overhead is minimal anyway
[16:18:39] <Dave_Stein> its funny cause in 1.6 they increased the speed of .attr by a ton and i was like wtf were they doing in there before
[16:18:45] <aaronmcadam> I need to read up on how to structure APIs for reuse
[16:18:51] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[16:18:54] <Dave_Stein> i had a few places where i needed to use [0].getAttribute instead since my profiles were showing .attr as the slowdown
[16:19:08] <aaronmcadam> making it break for silly people doing $(this).attr('id')
[16:19:09] <aaronmcadam> :D
[16:19:31] <aaronmcadam> it's the crossover of people not knowing js as u say
[16:19:35] <Dave_Stein> backbone.js was my favorite one, it makes it work just like OOP. i really just took out the extend function and its event handler for non-DOM events ( which i know is coming soon to jquery )
[16:19:40] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[16:19:47] <aaronmcadam> backbone is brilliant
[16:19:56] <Dave_Stein> it basically says fuck you to the constructor since you cant extend properly and just make initialize your function and you win
[16:20:10] <aaronmcadam> I use it as a sort of "interface" between my framework and the app-specific implementation
[16:20:11] <Dave_Stein> i made the one modification to my code to make it autocall parent constructors which doesnt exist in any language anywhere haha
[16:20:31] <aaronmcadam> are you using subviews?
[16:20:40] <Dave_Stein> but if toy extended product, i didnt want to have to write in toy's constructor parent.setName() cause then it gets more and more repetiviev as you extend more
[16:20:43] <solidus-river> how far up the dom tree does parent search?
[16:20:49] <Dave_Stein> in my PHP we manually write parent::__construct all the time
[16:20:49] <solidus-river> is it only immediate parents?
[16:20:54] <Dave_Stein> parents() goes way up
[16:21:01] <Dave_Stein> subviews in PHP or JS?
[16:21:03] <juha_> nathanw_: indeed
[16:21:05] <aaronmcadam> bbone
[16:21:09] <Dave_Stein> in JS im using jquery .tmpl as of late
[16:21:20] <Dave_Stein> i literally only took out extend and events which are like a total of 100 lines maybe
[16:21:21] <nathanw_> $('.qty').keyup(function() {   $(".total").val($(".rate").val() * $(".qty").val()); });
[16:21:22] <Dave_Stein> not using anything else
[16:21:28] <aaronmcadam> ohh
[16:21:30] <aaronmcadam> right!
[16:21:31] <aaronmcadam> cool
[16:21:32] <Dave_Stein> i dont like it authooking up shit and needing underscore when i have jquery already, etc
[16:21:37] <aaronmcadam> use underscore, it's soo awesome
[16:21:50] <nathanw_> so the value of .rate x .qty should be displayed in .total
[16:21:51] <aaronmcadam> oh but there's some really nice convenience methods in there
[16:21:58] <aaronmcadam> nice functional methods
[16:21:58] <Dave_Stein> maybe ill take a closer look
[16:22:04] <Dave_Stein> but after 4 years here, i have a lot of functional methods i use in jquery
[16:22:05] <aaronmcadam> like head and tail
[16:22:08] <Dave_Stein> like that i made up that we get in all our sites
[16:22:14] <aaronmcadam> and map and reduce
[16:22:19] <aaronmcadam> one sec
[16:22:23] <solidus-river> whats faster, parents or closest?
[16:22:23] <Dave_Stein> its food time
[16:22:26] <Dave_Stein> ill be back in a bit
[16:22:38] <Dave_Stein> .closest starts at yourself and parents goes up from there
[16:22:38] <solidus-river> nvm, closest
[16:22:50] <Dave_Stein> and parents doesnt stop where closest does so yeah :)
[16:22:56] <sarkis> hey guys, say i have a <label></label><input></input> i have the input as $(this), whats the easiest way to get the label?
[16:23:08] <enjoycrf> i am the master
[16:23:10] <Dave_Stein> okay before i go
[16:23:16] <sarkis> sibling only works if label comes after input right?
[16:23:18] <Dave_Stein> sarkis: label should have for="" with the id of input
[16:23:29] <sarkis> ah right
[16:23:33] <Dave_Stein> if you KNOW label is previous, you can do $(input).prev() but thats lame if markup changes
[16:23:35] <juha_> nathanw_: should work, not working?
[16:23:35] <sarkis> i can use that.. your right :)
[16:23:40] <Dave_Stein> go with for and then
[16:23:42] <Dave_Stein> ?attr @ sarkis
[16:23:42] <bot-t> sarkis, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[16:23:44] <Dave_Stein> ill be back
[16:23:44] <sarkis> cool thanks
[16:23:45] <aaronmcadam> haha nice twitter mention Dave_Stein :)
[16:25:10] <nathanw_> juha: nah not working. but there are many inputs with that class
[16:25:35] <nathanw_> juha: this is the page i'm working on, http://www.microhire.com/pacific2012
[16:25:53] <nathanw_> juha: there are multiple inputs with the classes specifed
[16:25:55] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: if you're still here http://skilldrick.co.uk/2011/07/easy-functional-programming-in-javascript-with-underscore-js-part-2/
[16:26:08] <nathanw_> juha: but i only want the JS to execute on keyup of that line...
[16:26:14] <juha_> nathanw_: yeah, there's your problem
[16:26:22] <nathanw_> juha: multiples ?
[16:26:24] <juha_> nathanw_: cool superheavy waveanimation
[16:26:30] <aaronmcadam> ?tell Dan_Stein: short guide to some underscore awesomeness: http://skilldrick.co.uk/2011/07/easy-functional-programming-in-javascript-with-underscore-js-part-2/
[16:26:31] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Okay.
[16:26:33] <nathanw_> juha: haha
[16:26:44] <juha_> nathanw_: i see your problem
[16:26:45] <juha_> hmmm
[16:27:38] <nathanw_> juha: overall plan is to have, prices set in .rate inputs, user enters qty and it auto calculates the total for x amount of that product
[16:28:02] <nathanw_> juha: then there will also need to be a subtotal area which i'm making atm..
[16:28:08] <juha_> nathanw_: sec!
[16:28:15] <nathanw_> juha: ok:)
[16:28:45] <quuxman> Anybody use the excellent threedubmedia drag plugin?
[16:29:47] <coldhead> lol dub
[16:29:54] <juha_> nathanw_: try this http://pastie.org/2640863
[16:30:41] <Zerxer> so finally going to update jquery on my site (from 1.4.1) but the jquery.hotkeys plugin I was using is broken on it. what's currently the best plugin (if only in your own opinion) to replace this?
[16:31:30] <nathanw_> juha: thanks for that
[16:31:50] <juha_> nathanw_: also, having rate editable in input is bad :P
[16:31:56] <nathanw_> juha: doesn't seem to work, but i have the value of total set to $0  , maybe need to remove the $ ?
[16:31:59] <quuxman> How do I detect wheather a drag started with a double click?
[16:32:16] <nathanw_> juha: oh thought that was readonly :p
[16:32:19] <juha_> nathanw_: you should just have some rate_id which gets correct rate on the backend, now i could change prices and make you pay me
[16:33:02] <juha_> nathanw_: i can edit input values even with read only, so i can submit 0 prices and get 10k items from you
[16:34:21] <nathanw_> juha: oh what's the point of readonly then o_O
[16:34:26] <nathanw_> juha: maybe not use input
[16:34:33] <Zerxer> ?hotkeys
[16:34:34] <bot-t> Zerxer, HotKeys | jQuery Plugins - Plugins - jQuery - HotKeys is a keyboard hooker plug-in. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hotkeys
[16:35:00] <Zerxer> oh good that links to the broken one I'm using now
[16:35:43] <Postmodernist> DUAL DETROIT BE IN DA HOUSE MOTHAFUCKAS!!!!
[16:35:51] <Postmodernist> OUR SPEAKERS ARE LARGE; MADONNA'S VOICE IS IN CHARGE.
[16:35:55] <juha_> nathanw_: you should put some sort of item_id and the price on the page, when browser submits, it sends quantity and item_id to backend which then again calculates the price
[16:36:03] <juha_> nathanw_: so that i can't cheat
[16:36:04] <aaronmcadam> ?tell BinaryKitten: think your site is down?
[16:36:04] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Okay.
[16:36:12] <juha_> nathanw_: also you should check that quantity is larger than 0
[16:36:28] <quuxman> the best way I can think is to attach a dblclick handler to the same element which sets a flag, and test for that inside the drag handler. When the double click flag is set, a timeout is set to erase it, but in dragstart, that timeout is cleared. On drag end, the double click flag is cleared
[16:36:48] <Postmodernist> We're from the 313; got our PHD -- it's our base degree!
[16:36:59] <aaronmcadam> uhh
[16:36:59] <quuxman> that way if the element is double clicked, and than dragged say a minute later, it's not interpreted as a double-click-drag
[16:37:11] <nathanw_> juha: ok thanks, think i didn't put read only code right, try now?
[16:37:22] <Postmodernist> Motown motherfuckas know we got the moves, the jquery grooves.
[16:37:31] <quuxman> this seems rather complicated for a fairly simple UI concept though
[16:38:02] <juha_> nathanw_: yeah, can't edit it now, but i can open my dev tools and edit values from there :P
[16:38:58] <nathanw_> juha: lol
[16:39:05] <nathanw_> juha: don't worry our clients are fools
[16:39:10] <nathanw_> juha: most use ie :(
[16:39:27] <juha_> nathanw_: never trust customer data. never. ever.
[16:39:36] <abjorn> http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/l0ml6/nodejs_has_jumped_the_shark/
[16:39:37] <abjorn> And this is why everyone on reddit is a dumbass
[16:39:39] <Postmodernist> nathanw_: I think you are a fool.
[16:39:42] <abjorn> jesus everyone on both sides of that argument
[16:39:43] <nathanw_> juha: and our staff have to call to confirm these orders in any case , this just saves huge amount of time gather user details etc
[16:39:53] <abjorn> NO U DA FOOL
[16:39:57] <abjorn> NUH UH, UR DA FOOL
[16:39:58] <abjorn> NO U
[16:39:58] <nathanw_> Postmodernist: no worries
[16:39:58] <abjorn> NO U
[16:39:59] <abjorn> NO U
[16:40:14] <juha_> nathanw_: it's going to take you about 1 hour to make sanity checks, which will save lot's of manhours and money for you or your employer
[16:40:15] <Postmodernist> nathanw_: DUAL DETROIT still loves you though.
[16:40:28] <juha_> nathanw_: also when you tell it that way to your boss, you'll get nice fat bonus
[16:40:36] <aaronmcadam> anyone know if the jquery conference slides are all up anywhere?
[16:41:19] <nathanw_> juha: thanks, i like you.
[16:41:31] <juha_> nathanw_: i like me too.
[16:41:37] <aaronmcadam> ah found em
[16:41:40] <aaronmcadam> http://lanyrd.com/2011/jquery-conference-boston/
[16:41:43] <nathanw_> nice
[16:41:46] <juha_> aaronmcadam: nice thanks
[16:41:55] <juha_> aaronmcadam: gotta check them out
[16:41:56] <nathanw_> juha: so how to proceed hmmm. i'm learning js/jquery
[16:42:44] <juha_> nathanw_: i would change the page so that it still has the price on it, but hidden input called itemid or something, then after submit you check values on backend (php or something)
[16:42:52] <aaronmcadam> ?jqfundamentals @ nathanw_
[16:42:53] <bot-t> nathanw_, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[16:43:02] <juha_> nathanw_: basically you get item price for the submitted itemid and then multiply it by qty
[16:43:23] <aaronmcadam> k i'm out too late, 00:43, goodnight nursey
[16:43:44] <juha_> hah, i didn't even notice that it's almost 3am here
[16:44:01] <nathanw_> juha: so rather than having prices inside the inputs, have unique ids - grab prices from DB and then calc.
[16:44:17] <juha_> nathanw_: exactly!
[16:44:33] <juha_> nathanw_: that way i couldn't edit prices and get stuff for free from you ;)
[16:44:56] <nathanw_> juha: lol, we are a hire company - if someone was to do that the order would be ignored... but we would have their cc details ;)
[16:45:05] <Postmodernist> DUAL DETROIT be in da HOW-se.
[16:45:13] <juha_> nathanw_: think how much your boss would yell at you when (s)he notices that your order tracking system has $0 for items worth $1000s to your company :P
[16:45:18] <nathanw_> juha: may not be worth implementing such features at this stag
[16:45:33] <domino141> if i have this: var field = $(tooltip).children(".postAuthFields").find("#" + sanitize(this.name)); and i want to append something to the dom, do i do field.append or $(field).append ?
[16:45:33] <Postmodernist> ajpiano be kickin' it down, kickin' it down with 10,000 pounds of concrete.
[16:45:37] <domino141> what are the rules for this?
[16:45:46] <juha_> nathanw_: i disagree with you
[16:45:47] <nathanw_> juha: haha , yes true. we are expecting low hundreds to use this form.
[16:45:59] <ddoom> How can I add a div between two others? e.g. <div id="a">...</div>{new div here}<div id="b>...</div>
[16:46:15] <tos9> This may be an XY problem. Quite new to js/jQ. Is there a way, given an arbitrarily nested object containing elements not yet in the dom, to append all those elements into the dom at the appropriate nesting level?
[16:46:29] <teamcoltra_work> http://paste2.org/p/1689767 after the script refreshes it doesn't seem to "clean" the old data... so the marquee that was scrolling before still loads, and then the new data kinda competes for who is going to be on screen. Also how can I get it to load immediately when the page loads? Right now I have to wait for it to refresh before it starts
[16:46:29] <juha_> ?insertafter @ ddoom
[16:46:30] <bot-t> ddoom, .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[16:46:32] <nathanw_> juha: you are more knowledgeable than me, will take me longer.  also big problem is that website is run on business catalyst.... so custom functions are fun to make.
[16:46:55] <ddoom> juha_: thank you sir
[16:46:59] <tos9> I know I can recursive append obviously. Just wondering if there's a builtin.
[16:47:15] <juha_> nathanw_: well, you can do lot's of stuff with jquery, but you should ALWAYS validate customer data on backend
[16:47:30] <nathanw_> juha: noted thankyou.
[16:47:34] <juha_> nathanw_: otherwise someone could get free stuff or even destroy your whole database
[16:47:51] <nathanw_> juha: free stuff isn't going to happen.. destroying database.. how ?
[16:48:09] <nathanw_> juha: small business people will notice if something is wrong
[16:48:45] <juha_> nathanw_: if you don't validate data, sql injections are a possibility. so i could put into your input: lol'; drop database your_database;
[16:49:26] <juha_> nathanw_: google is full of useful information about sql injections and preventing them
[16:49:42] <nathanw_> juha: hmmm learning lots thankyou
[16:49:49] <nathanw_> off to make toast brb...
[16:49:55] <teamcoltra_work> Sorry if I didn't make sense at all
[16:50:09] <teamcoltra_work> English is my primary langauge... using it is not my greatest skill ;)
[16:52:04] <toddlikesdesign> Anyone familiar with the jQuery Cookie Plugin?
[16:54:04] <toddlikesdesign> Running this script: http://pastebin.com/kVTPYgkV but not sure how to display the hidden elements if the animation doesn't run since they are hidden by the CSS.
[16:57:43] * Postmodernist is writing a DUAL DETROIT jQuery plugin so SICK SICK SICK I need 911!
[16:58:04] <nathanw_> back
[16:58:42] <Postmodernist> $("#madonna").sex();
[17:00:54] <juha_> crazy
[17:03:28] <nathanw_> juha: what about this ?http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/calculation/calculation.plugin.htm
[17:05:01] <juha_> nathanw_: that seems pretty perfect for your needs
[17:05:11] <nathanw_> juha: yeah just saw that other example
[17:05:13] <nathanw_> wooooooo
[17:05:59] <nathanw_> juha: because we don't want to publish prices on the internet, i'm going to pass them via the url, so only the link we give out will work
[17:06:10] <Nuck> https://github.com/NuckChorris/jQuery-tag/blob/master/tags.jQuery.js#L88 Somebody explain why this won't work?
[17:06:18] <amtal> Are there any standards on how to indent long alpha = foo().bar().baz()... chains?
[17:06:26] <ddoom> whats the best way to check if there are elements that match a given selector? e.g. $('.content') if there are no elements with class content how do I check it?
[17:06:43] <Nuck> ddoom: I'd do that and check length
[17:06:51] <Nuck> jQuery objects are arrays
[17:06:57] <juha_> nathanw_: so, you mean that by changing values in the url, i can change prices? ;)
[17:10:15] <Kamakazi> anybody who uses IE8 or before needs to be slapped
[17:10:56] <juha_> Kamakazi: have fun slapping the internets
[17:11:02] <juha_> tell them i said hi
[17:11:58] <nathanw_> juha: yes... but we could encode url
[17:12:14] <nathanw_> juha: but you could still use firebug to edit but w/e
[17:12:25] <nathanw_> juha: not a huge concern at this point :p
[17:13:32] <juha_> nathanw_: yeah, but it might grow to be big concern after couple tech savy customers find out how to abuse and then spread the word :P
[17:13:56] <juha_> nathanw_: you should always think like a hacker, trying to break into your system
[17:15:53] <amid_hasan> how to you pass a parameter into a method using a jsonp web api?
[17:15:59] <nathanw_> juha: very true.
[17:16:10] <nathanw_> juha: people are sooooo ridiculously stupid though
[17:16:48] <juha_> nathanw_: that might be, but never trust their data
[17:17:33] <nathanw_> juha: nah they can't even get the paper forms right !
[17:18:09] <juha_> 999/1000 times the data is proper, but every now and then someone will try to hack your system with inproper data
[17:18:48] <juha_> nathanw_: well, as you might already understand, i'm not talking about your customers, but some random people who finds your site ands wants to have some fun
[17:19:35] <nathanw_> juha: yeah true... that's the good thing about our hosting. its unlikely being hosted with adobe
[17:19:42] <nathanw_> www.businesscatalyst.com
[17:20:47] <juha_> nathanw_: so, they have provided you with the backend code for handling orders?
[17:21:38] <nathanw_> juha: yep
[17:21:56] <amid_hasan> Does business catalyst also do payment processing?
[17:22:42] <juha_> nathanw_: ok, then it's a different thing, as they will do the data cleaning for you
[17:24:35] <nathanw_> juha: thanks for your help
[17:24:45] <juha_> glad to help
[17:24:50] <nathanw_> :)
[17:27:47] <ProLoser|Work> how do you do oop inheritance in js?
[17:28:02] <ProLoser|Work> do i have to declare the methods of both objects and then merge the base onto the child?
[17:28:28] <coldhead> ProLoser|Work: http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html
[17:29:19] <ProLoser|Work> i'm getting a lot of mixed feedback
[17:29:35] <coldhead> you've chosen a difficult path
[17:29:37] <ProLoser|Work> people are directing me to $.extend(), someone else says to stop calling them classes, i see messing with prototypes
[17:29:55] <ProLoser|Work> like i'm not sure how to go about things
[17:30:06] <ProLoser|Work> was reading up on the subject here: http://killdream.github.com/blog/drafts/2011-09-12-understanding-javascript-oop.html
[17:30:18] <ProLoser|Work> but i've never seen anyone do it in such a manner (using Object.create())
[17:30:45] <ProLoser|Work> and the code you linked to doesn't appear to leverage the prototype whatsoever
[17:30:49] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work $.extend just extends an object.. not an OOP object, thats like using a singleton
[17:31:10] <ProLoser|Work> like using a singleton?
[17:31:19] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work hold on let me dig up an article for you
[17:31:20] <ProLoser|Work> okay...
[17:31:39] <ProLoser|Work> look all i want to do is create some skeleton mvc files that i can then extend for page-specific logic
[17:31:45] <Dave_Stein> one sec helping coworker
[17:31:46] <Dave_Stein> :)
[17:31:46] <ProLoser|Work> and i can't even figure out how to go about doing THAT
[17:32:11] <Dave_Stein> http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript
[17:32:22] <Dave_Stein> ah im linking to one specific pattern but check that out
[17:32:37] <Dave_Stein> if you want some good object inheritence, JS isn't good out of the box for that because of new keyword issues
[17:33:02] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: what new issues
[17:33:09] <ProLoser|Work> i'm just trying to come up with a good way to structure my code
[17:33:23] <ProLoser|Work> it doesn't HAVE to be inheritence necessarily
[17:33:25] <Dave_Stein> when you use new keyword you can't really extend from what i recall, i can't remember why
[17:33:37] <Dave_Stein> but i do recall realizing thats why Backbone.js doesn't use the constructor to do inheritence
[17:33:55] <Dave_Stein> Backbone.js just has their own "extend" fumnction which always calls a method called "initialize" which programmer needs to make
[17:34:01] <ProLoser|Work> here's the thing, i've sort of organized my code into mvc, the controller actions are page-specific collection of method calls, the model handles the json, ajax and data massaging, and the view handles bindings and templating
[17:34:01] <bencc> myselector = $(selector).add(el); // how can I remove it later?
[17:34:03] <Dave_Stein> so you use that function as your constructor and then inheritence works fine
[17:34:15] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work check out Backbone
[17:34:32] <ProLoser|Work> read up on that, and spine, and underscore, and jsmvc, and sprout core, and mustache
[17:34:32] <Dave_Stein> el.remove()
[17:34:47] <ProLoser|Work> we're kind of on deadlines so they don't want to bother integrating (necessarily) with any other fw
[17:35:03] <Dave_Stein> like ive mentioned several times in the past few days
[17:35:12] <Dave_Stein> i personally took out the extend functions of backbone
[17:35:17] <Dave_Stein> replaced some shit to use jquery instead of underscore
[17:35:23] <Dave_Stein> and then tada, i had my own mvc
[17:35:32] <bitwise_> Dave_Stein: release it!
[17:35:36] <ProLoser|Work> blog post it
[17:35:45] <Dave_Stein> that's a good idea considering people keep asking about it
[17:36:03] <ProLoser|Work> how complex is it to do,a nd is the code standalone?
[17:36:05] <bitwise_> the only reason i haven't checked it out is because of the dependency on _
[17:36:16] <Dave_Stein> well i really only took the bit for MVC
[17:36:18] <ProLoser|Work> well then what about spine.js?
[17:36:19] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: what do you actually use the extend method for?  subclassing your controller?
[17:36:23] <Dave_Stein> i ahvent checked out spine
[17:36:42] <Dave_Stein> isnt that just a smaller version of backbone?
[17:36:48] <Dave_Stein> danzik171 let me go see what i did exactly
[17:36:57] <domino141> is backbone awesome?
[17:37:03] <domino141> i am thinking whether i should use it
[17:37:08] <Dave_Stein> i didnt use it out of box since i dont like all the autoo shit it does
[17:37:11] <domino141> i have a bunch of horrible spaghetti code thats been dumped on me
[17:37:38] <Dave_Stein> ah danzik171 heres what i did
[17:37:39] <Es0teric> how do i make it so that when i click on an element, it toggles something and changes the title name... then when i click it again it changes the title name again.. kinda like an on/off type of thing
[17:37:57] <Dave_Stein> i based this off of Backbone's source code ( the stuff i ripped I namespaced in Bone )
[17:38:11] <Es0teric> so the default for the elemnt is "on" when i click it, it changes to "off" on the title.. then i click it again, and it changes to "on"
[17:38:13] <Dave_Stein> App.View.extend = Bone.extend;
[17:38:18] <Dave_Stein> and then for views i do
[17:38:49] <Dave_Stein> App.Views.Item = App.View.extend({
[17:39:04] <Dave_Stein> and for things that share those properties I do App.Views.Item.X = App.Views.item.extend({
[17:39:06] <bitwise_> spine.js looks intersting
[17:39:10] <warrenparsons> Es0teric: The most common way to handle that is to set a flag on the element to indicate its state, and then check against that flag on each click.
[17:39:17] <domino141> does backbone + ich work well?
[17:39:25] <warrenparsons> Usually a class or data.
[17:39:27] <Es0teric> warrenparsons, how would you do that?
[17:39:36] <warrenparsons> One sec.
[17:39:52] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: do you know the diff between spine.js and backbone.js exactly?
[17:39:54] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: so you're not using inheritance at all, your just using mixins basically (which is completely valid, just saying)
[17:40:18] <solidus-river> how do i filter a set of matched elements by id?
[17:40:28] <Dave_Stein> ha im glad you said that cause i asked that on stack once
[17:40:30] <Dave_Stein> if backbone uses mixins
[17:40:35] <Dave_Stein> and no one answered :)
[17:40:41] <coldhead> ?filter @ solidus-river
[17:40:42] <bot-t> solidus-river, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[17:40:44] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: not really, i didn't look much at spine.js - i rolled my own stuff basically
[17:40:53] <Dave_Stein> ill go ask on stack haha
[17:41:17] <Dave_Stein> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6530444/backbonejs-or-spinejs
[17:41:42] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: "In traditional object-oriented programming languages, mixins are classes which provide the functionality to be inherited by a subclass."
[17:41:54] <Dave_Stein> i think they are one and the same, since my "mixins" definitely inherit from parent class
[17:43:39] <ProLoser|Work> what's itch?
[17:43:39] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: yes and no - it's not true inheritance in the sense that i'm pretty sure foo instanceof SubController === false in your case, but i'd need to try it
[17:44:08] <Dave_Stein> danzik171 even PHP sucked at that kinda check for some time haha
[17:44:12] <Dave_Stein> oh silly PHP
[17:44:24] <warrenparsons> Esoteric: http://jsfiddle.net/UQNgy/
[17:44:32] <Dave_Stein> ahhh heres a reason to use backbone over spine for sure
[17:44:37] <Dave_Stein>  Spine did away with the concept of Collections.
[17:44:39] <Dave_Stein> so important
[17:44:52] <warrenparsons> Then you put whatever you want in the two parts of the if/else statement.
[17:45:45] <ProLoser|Work> how are collections important (excuse my noobness)
[17:45:51] <ProLoser|Work> aren't they just maps or arrays or something?
[17:46:53] <Dave_Stein> they are real useful maps
[17:47:01] <Dave_Stein> this applies to my PHP and JS code like
[17:47:11] <Dave_Stein> if i have a model... i dont wanna call new everytime on it since thats expensive
[17:47:20] <ProLoser|Work> i don't ever remember explicitly using maps in my code, but i'm still mostly a jq whore
[17:47:22] <Dave_Stein> you make a read method in your collection, which will nkow to do new model if one does not exist
[17:47:31] <Dave_Stein> otherwise it just returns the cached object
[17:47:35] <ProLoser|Work> sounds like singleton
[17:47:37] <ProLoser|Work> and uh
[17:47:39] <ProLoser|Work> query caching
[17:47:57] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: the thing is, implementing that on your own is trivial =P
[17:48:04] <ProLoser|Work> what do they call it? memoable
[17:48:17] <ProLoser|Work> *memoizing
[17:48:31] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: that is very true. but think of all the people liek ProLoser|Work that just jump into frameworks
[17:48:35] <ProLoser|Work> i agree with danzik171 (i think)
[17:48:43] <Dave_Stein> it's best to choose a framework that will give you the tools you should be using at start
[17:48:56] <AfroTurf> anyone use jquery tools overlay?
[17:48:57] <Dave_Stein> also my collection is a ... crap which pattern is this one
[17:49:08] <ProLoser|Work> even for the noob-friendly fw's, just cuz they are there doesn't mean they use them
[17:49:16] <ProLoser|Work> and this is coming from someone who is big on cakephp :)
[17:49:28] <Dave_Stein> my collection class is just doing a constructor with prototype
[17:49:55] <Dave_Stein> also when you realize you wanna make a collection class, a noob will make one much worse off than if the framework came with it
[17:50:08] <Dave_Stein> my collection class is 100 lines of goodness
[17:50:15] <ProLoser|Work> lol
[17:50:19] <ProLoser|Work> you said it's crap :)
[17:50:26] <Dave_Stein> no mine isnt crap :)
[17:50:28] <Dave_Stein> people make crap
[17:50:36] <ProLoser|Work> Dave_Stein: also my collection is a ... crap
[17:50:42] <Dave_Stein> haha
[17:50:47] <coldhead> ?w sturgeon's law
[17:50:48] <bot-t> coldhead, Sturgeon's Law - Sturgeon's revelation, commonly referred to as Sturgeon's law, is an adage derived from quotations by Theodore Sturgeon, an American science fiction author. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Law
[17:51:21] <coldhead> Commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crud" or "ninety percent of everything is crap"
[17:51:28] <Dave_Stein> haha nice
[17:52:09] <Dave_Stein> well anyway if youre not using collections, its a big mistake
[17:52:12] <Dave_Stein> :)
[17:52:29] <danzik171> gotta disagree there.  i don't use em, i haven't seen the need.
[17:52:31] <Dave_Stein> and to anyone that doesnt know how to make a good class for that, id say go to backbone.js cause theyve done it for you
[17:52:45] <Dave_Stein> if you have multiple places in the code that might look for Item 1
[17:52:52] <Dave_Stein> do you always do new Item(1) ?
[17:52:54] <Kamakazi> can anybody point me in the right direction for putting search functionality on my site?
[17:53:13] <Dave_Stein> Kamakazi: look up Sphinx :)
[17:53:34] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: no, i do something like Class.get( 1234 ) which returns a $.Deferred, so it's the same API whether or not it's cached or actually doing a call to retrieve the object
[17:53:40] <Dave_Stein> a collection read method ensures that if two places are doing action on Item(1) that both places are accessing same object same time
[17:53:43] <ProLoser|Work> Dave_Stein: factory pattern?
[17:53:58] <solidus-river> so guys, i have a really really complex jQuery selector http://www.pastie.org/private/ev2ztzhqjozhnkj2m4vy4a
[17:54:02] <solidus-river> any ideas on how to simplify that?
[17:54:05] <Dave_Stein> no factory is more advanced, you send some stuff and it determines what object to make out of it
[17:54:14] <Dave_Stein> although i suppose my collection class does that in a minor way too
[17:54:21] <solidus-river> and with this.id actually get the id attribute of the dom element or do i have to do this.ele.id or some sort
[17:54:21] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: and a lot of the time, you don't want objects to be sharing references
[17:54:31] <danzik171> you can end up with some ugly bugs if you don't realize that's happening
[17:54:42] <danzik171> "howd this property get set?!!?"
[17:54:50] <Dave_Stein> if youre using a collection you know that its shared :)
[17:55:04] <Dave_Stein> i mean i can see what youre saying, i think it depends on the app
[17:55:21] <Dave_Stein> do your apps have page refreshes?
[17:55:25] <ProLoser|Work> solidus-river: $(li[id=current_id_in_loop] ul.comments).append();
[17:55:38] <danzik171> nope.  or i should say, not frequently.
[17:55:39] <ProLoser|Work> wait i'm being a moron
[17:55:46] <ProLoser|Work> li#current_id_in_loop
[17:55:50] <Dave_Stein> yeah i have two major apps that dont refresh ever
[17:55:54] <Dave_Stein> so collections are super important to me
[17:56:28] <Dave_Stein> like for one of them i have a project list on the left side, and lets say im viewing by "all projects" in main pane. i need to ensure that my two views for a project
[17:56:33] <solidus-river> ProLoser|Work: lol, thank you :) that looked like i was doing all sorts of things wrong
[17:56:37] <Dave_Stein> are both using the same model so when the model updates, both places update properly
[17:56:50] <Dave_Stein> if i dont force references in that case, its possible that my views will have incorrect data
[17:57:03] <Dave_Stein> that was something i liked in backbone, that they made sure to pass a model to their views
[17:57:08] <secob> hello all, today i was writing some unit tests with qunit and i noticed that there was no way to test for "somewhat" equal items given an epsilon value.  For example comparing 2 floats up to 5 decimal places for equality.  Would anyone else find this useful if i worked on a patch to add it?
[17:57:13] <Dave_Stein> so i can call view.update() after updating a model, and it will know whats up
[17:57:32] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: then in your controller, throw an event saying "ModelUpdated.MyController" and send the model as an argument, and in your two views, bind to it and do stuff
[17:57:44] <danzik171> that's why i never saw the point - it was trivial to do that
[17:57:50] <Dave_Stein> i actually do use views, but i dont like having to pass a model each time
[17:57:53] <Dave_Stein> when the view can just have it on start
[17:57:56] <Dave_Stein> cause as you make more and more events
[17:58:02] <Dave_Stein> its more places to remember you gotta pass the model along
[17:58:12] <ProLoser|Work> man
[17:58:14] <ProLoser|Work> i feel like a noob
[17:58:24] <ProLoser|Work> nowhere in my code am i using anything like what you guys describe
[17:58:25] <Dave_Stein> err *i actually do use events
[17:58:32] <ProLoser|Work> most of my shit is just templates, binds and ajax calls
[17:58:36] <Dave_Stein> i trigger like item.namechanged
[17:58:37] <ProLoser|Work> there are  no complex objects or anything
[17:58:45] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work it took me al ong time to get here working with a lot of devs :)
[17:58:48] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: it's that difficult to add a comma and a property to your event? =P
[17:58:56] <Dave_Stein> yes on a complicated app
[17:59:03] <ProLoser|Work> Dave_Stein: the thing is i TRY to use it, but i don't see how it is applicable to me
[17:59:16] <Dave_Stein> on behance.net i pretty much use singletons
[17:59:18] <ProLoser|Work> it feels like my code should suffice, although I suppose i could 'model' my dom a bit more
[17:59:22] <Dave_Stein> prosite.com is more mvc stuff
[17:59:22] <Dave_Stein> depends
[17:59:51] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: you wanna minimize the amount you have to type, therefore needing to add model for X possible events is more places to screw up
[17:59:57] <ProLoser|Work> interesting, you work for behance?
[17:59:59] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: much better to have one point of entry
[18:00:03] <Dave_Stein> first programmer
[18:00:10] <dougb> is there something i need to do for javascript loaded on the page to find elements to interact with that have loaded through AJAX?
[18:00:12] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: well, that's where unit testing comes into play.  you write a test expecting that event to be thrown with some map of data.  if it fails, you screwed up
[18:00:29] <ProLoser|Work> dougb: look up live() and delegate()
[18:00:32] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: i'd rather not have that failure come up, or have to have a test seeing that the model went through etc
[18:01:08] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: passing around extra things when you dont need to is just a bad practice in the end. the point of an object is that its selfaware and stores what it needs
[18:01:09] <dougb> i took it out of $(document).load( function(){ });
[18:01:36] <Dave_Stein> dougb: let me double check load api i always use $.ajax and do that stuff on success callbck
[18:01:38] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: it's personal preference at this point imo.  i disagree that it's bad practice
[18:01:49] <Dave_Stein> danzik171 you will be the death of me! haha
[18:02:26] <Dave_Stein> ok one last thing to get across why i think its bad
[18:02:35] <ProLoser|Work> Dave_Stein: i don't like you anymore :( pro site was my idea
[18:02:39] <Dave_Stein> well look at it like this. i have an object with the members first name and last name. i have a function that puts em together, and trims whitespace. the purpose of an object is toat h i can do person.fullName()
[18:02:56] <Dave_Stein> but if youre passing youd be doing person.fullName( first_name, last_name )
[18:02:59] <Dave_Stein> for no reason
[18:03:04] <Dave_Stein> thats how i view passing around model each time
[18:03:21] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work there are a lot of things "like" ProSite but ours syncs with work youve put on our site already and its all JS fun time
[18:03:46] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: why would i be doing that?  put a .fullName function on the model's .prototype, done.
[18:03:46] <ProLoser|Work> well, i have some shit that would make it better, but a lot of it is basically what i was building :9
[18:03:49] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work when wordpress said you can drag and drop columns, i noticed you only see boxes on an admin screen. ProSite you can live drag and drop your actual site columns. that was a bitch
[18:03:50] <ProLoser|Work> i hate the internet sometimes
[18:04:06] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: exactly you wouldnt do that cause it'd be strange to pass in params you already have
[18:04:22] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: hence it's strange to pass a model in, if its a param you can already have
[18:04:33] <Dave_Stein> haha
[18:04:43] <Dave_Stein> well we're always open to suggestions if you wanna send some our way
[18:04:53] <Dave_Stein> but custom CSS/HTML is coming soon
[18:05:10] <ProLoser|Work> i would, but it's a project i've been working on for a while now and has been like the 1 thing i've been skeptical about sharing freely
[18:05:17] <ProLoser|Work> despite most of my other work being open source
[18:05:19] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: i actually need to get on using deferred, how are you using it to cache stuff?
[18:05:23] <danzik171> Dave_Stein:  it's just personal preference at this point.  i designed my stuff such that everything is unit testable, including views.
[18:05:56] <ProLoser|Work> still, it includes a lot of what you guys have not considered yet
[18:05:58] <Dave_Stein> i thought $.deferred help so that if i need to wait for 3 ajax calls to complete, it will fire the callback when 3 are done
[18:06:04] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: simple as hell - $.when can take a normal object and return/resolve a $.Deferred
[18:06:19] <Dave_Stein> and you set your $.Deferred to the new model?
[18:06:20] <danzik171> so do return $.when( cache[id] || $.ajax....)
[18:06:28] <Dave_Stein> ahhh
[18:07:18] <Dave_Stein> and thats why you say its similar api to collections
[18:07:46] * ProLoser|Work looks up $.when()
[18:07:52] <Dave_Stein> theres just no built in reset/removefor each cache var you make
[18:07:57] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: using what i just said, i don't see the point in collections.  it's trivial to implement, literally one or two lines of extra code per Model class
[18:07:59] <Dave_Stein> how do you do that syntax in IRC?
[18:08:15] <danzik171> reset/removeFor?
[18:08:35] <Dave_Stein> in an app that doesnt refresh, i call MyCollection.reset() on cleanup of a screen
[18:08:42] <Dave_Stein> so it properly nulls everything
[18:09:11] <Dave_Stein> or remove for when an element is deleted, i remove it from collection which is just a wrapper for delete
[18:09:24] <danzik171> i would never, ever call something like that on a collection personally - those types of actions belong on a controller, which then should modify the collection and throw an event to update the view
[18:09:33] <ProLoser|Work> is using $.when() similar to using callbacks in $.ajax()???
[18:09:38] <danzik171> but that's how i designed it
[18:10:01] <Dave_Stein> yeah my controller calls Collection.reset() and throws the event like you do
[18:10:24] <Dave_Stein> it sounds like you use deferred as a simple way of making collections, without having an actual collection object
[18:10:36] <Dave_Stein> so yeah youre right its preference to ahve that object or not
[18:10:42] <Dave_Stein> but we both make sure that new wouldnt be called twice needlessly
[18:10:47] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: no, i have an actual collection var in the controller.  it's a plain old object.
[18:11:03] <Dave_Stein> right cause you define the var like cache or item_cache or apple_cache
[18:11:16] <Dave_Stein> so you are acting on item_cache while I act on ItemCollection which wraps around that
[18:12:00] <Dave_Stein> i actually do something else in the collection too that i didnt bring up that is useful
[18:12:25] <Dave_Stein> Items = new Collection( 'App.Views.Item' )
[18:12:32] <wookiehangover> ooh, ooh finally some code
[18:12:33] <Dave_Stein> Items.add( 1, data )
[18:12:49] <wookiehangover> I've been waiting on the edge of my seat
[18:12:54] <wookiehangover> for a fiddle or something
[18:12:57] <Dave_Stein> it actually adds Item1 to the cache object but also calls new App.Views.Item() and passes the data to the view
[18:13:05] <Dave_Stein> wookiehangover i think ill make a blog post :)
[18:13:27] <Dave_Stein> but im also guessing that in your deferred ajax call you populate the data as i do
[18:13:30] <wookiehangover> about deferreds in backbone
[18:13:36] <danzik171> see i feel like that's too strongly bound together.  i'd rather throw an event and bind to it in the view to be loosely coupled
[18:13:45] <danzik171> but again, all of my stuff is unit testable
[18:13:51] <wookiehangover> cause they are the little kitty's pj;s
[18:14:01] <danzik171> i can pass the view a mock controller, the controller a mock view/model class, etc...
[18:14:20] <Dave_Stein> danzik171 both of ours are. sorry if im carrying on - i just like talking about these things to iron out difference for when your way or my way might prove advantagous in other situations :)
[18:14:35] <wookiehangover> danzik171: do you use sinon?
[18:14:46] <danzik171> whats sinon
[18:14:51] <wookiehangover> ooh shit
[18:14:59] <wookiehangover> http://sinonjs.org/
[18:15:03] <wookiehangover> your new bestie
[18:15:24] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: its bound since if im doing a new Item, I should hope I have data going into it. my create methods are "static"
[18:15:35] <wookiehangover> its hot shit. gives you stubbing, mocking, and fake ajax for qunit, jasmine, etc
[18:15:36] <danzik171> ill have to look into it, i've just been using plain old qunit and a mockjax lib
[18:15:52] <wookiehangover> sinon is pretty awesome
[18:15:52] <Dave_Stein> is qunit better than jasmine?
[18:16:00] <Dave_Stein> ive heard of jasmine agan and again in the world, but always qunit in here
[18:16:15] <danzik171> jquery uses qunit.  i'm a jquery fanboy.  ergo, i use qunit =P
[18:16:16] <wookiehangover> Dave_Stein: it depends on who you ask
[18:16:30] <Dave_Stein> ill have to check it out
[18:16:44] <wookiehangover> I used Jasmine on my last big project, and switched to qunit for my most recent
[18:17:04] <wookiehangover> qunit's test suite is better IMO
[18:17:10] <wookiehangover> design, stack tracing, speed
[18:17:11] <Dave_Stein> also since im using .apply .add( id, data ) can be .add( id, whatever, whatever_else ) so my only real strong bind there is that the first argument must be an id
[18:17:25] <Dave_Stein> well i really gotta take a good look at both and start using one of em
[18:17:33] <Dave_Stein> but im guessing qunit would be leading based on jquery using it like danzik said ha
[18:17:47] <Dave_Stein> unit testing my JS is a shortcoming of mine that im going to be remedying very soon
[18:17:53] <wookiehangover> jasmine's great in its own right
[18:18:07] <wookiehangover> spec syntax has its advantages
[18:18:19] <wookiehangover> really really easy for guys that are used to rspec and rails
[18:18:36] <wookiehangover> because that's who (pivotal labs) wrote it
[18:18:38] <Dave_Stein> im not used to rails i never did it
[18:18:39] <Dave_Stein> haha
[18:18:42] <Dave_Stein> yeah i met those guys a couple times
[18:18:55] <wookiehangover> ya they've got an office here in boulder
[18:18:57] <wookiehangover> great dudes
[18:19:13] <Dave_Stein> i met em at a conference and then saw em at a recruiting event we were recruiting at too
[18:19:51] <danzik171> wookiehangover: nice.  their mocking stuff will fit in nicely with the pseudo interface stuff i do
[18:20:18] <Dave_Stein> oh maybe you guys know this
[18:20:24] <wookiehangover> danzik171: my favorite part is the server repsonse mocking
[18:20:28] <Dave_Stein> do any of those test suites have the ability to interface with phpunit/selenium
[18:20:42] <wookiehangover> this.server.respondWith("GET", "/some/article/comments.json",
[18:20:42] <wookiehangover>                                 [200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
[18:20:42] <wookiehangover>                                  '[{ id: 12, comment: "Hey there" }]']);
[18:20:44] <Dave_Stein> right now we have selenium hooked into phpunit and a virtual browser so it runs through everything togethe
[18:21:14] <wookiehangover> hmm, maybe by way of jstestdriver
[18:21:33] <Dave_Stein> oh yeah i forgot about that thing
[18:21:39] <Dave_Stein> i read about it when i erad about jasmine since they use it
[18:21:51] <danzik171> wookiehangover: yea, what i use can do a similar thing: http://enterprisejquery.com/2010/07/mock-your-ajax-requests-with-mockjax-for-rapid-development/
[18:23:04] <wookiehangover> yep
[18:23:36] <Dave_Stein> gd danzik whats your twitter? have i asked that before?
[18:24:00] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: dunno, but i dont tweet ever really.
[18:24:42] <Dave_Stein> well you just lost all credibility in arguing anything ever haha jk
[18:26:45] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: eh, maybe ill get into it one day.  haven't seen the point as of yet
[18:27:04] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: i follow a lot of people from here so i find some good articles to read that way
[18:45:08] <bitwise_> is there an jquery equivalent for the ecma 1.6 filter func?
[18:46:28] <Dave_Stein> bitwise_ what does that do?
[18:46:38] <Dave_Stein> explain the functionality and i might be able to tell you :)
[18:46:55] <danzik171> bitwise_: $.grep
[18:47:23] <bitwise_> danzik171: nice!
[18:47:41] <bitwise_> Dave_Stein: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[18:49:06] <Dave_Stein> ?map @ bitwise_ that one?
[18:49:11] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, last - jQuery plugin to support client-side logging for debugging purposes. It allows you to log any string text/message you want, and will display the log at the bottom of the page (& optionally in a pop... http://plugins.jquery.com/projects/plugins?page=26&type=57
[18:49:16] <Dave_Stein> no thats not it
[18:49:17] <Dave_Stein> god damn
[18:49:35] <Dave_Stein> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[18:50:57] <domino141> $.each(collection, function ()  {  } )
[18:51:15] <domino141> the function always executes in-line right? theres no way it should execute before or after the rest of the code around this?
[18:56:09] <bitwise_> Dave_Stein: do you know if there is a way to have the map function's context be something other than global?
[18:56:39] <Dave_Stein> errr if it doesnt say in the api there i guess not
[18:56:42] <domino141> i have this: $(tooltip).append('<div class="preAuthFields"><ul>');    i set a breakpoint here, and when i look at the elements, it seems to have inserted a </ul> after the <ul> as well as a </div>
[18:56:44] <Dave_Stein> i never use it, i just know it exists
[18:56:58] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: is it true that qunit needs to run in the browser?
[18:57:02] <domino141> is append not right for this? why isnt it inserting the html as is?
[18:58:21] <nathanw_> anyone know how to use toggleClass to swap the class on an element OTHER than the one clicked ?
[18:58:36] <nathanw_> or execute multiple class swaps
[18:58:45] <bitwise_> domino141: check out .wrap
[18:58:49] <nathanw_> eg- swap the button image and change the li background
[18:58:58] <danzik171> Dave_Stein: probably not.  it's just javascript after all, ill bet you can run it on node and spit out results
[18:59:07] <bitwise_> it will construct elements out of those partial tags you sent in
[18:59:35] <[silvia10]> hola
[18:59:38] <domino141> bitwise_   - i am not using wrap, and it's adding extra tags, is that expected behavior?
[18:59:49] <[silvia10]> como estas
[18:59:52] <domino141> it's adding the </ul> and </div> at that breakpoint
[18:59:56] <[silvia10]> todo bien
[19:00:02] <[silvia10]> soy argentina
[19:00:07] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: gr looks like ill be using jasmine then cause it can do that np
[19:00:12] <[silvia10]> made in argentina
[19:00:15] <Dave_Stein> danzik171: anyway im outta here, good debating earlier ttyl
[19:00:20] <Coderah> domino141: i think .append does dom elements which would be why that is happening. it doesn't just insert plain text. I could be wrong if so someone please correct me

[19:01:46] <Coderah> domino141: perhaps if you showed us in a little more detail what you were trying to do (jsfiddle perhaps) we could help
[19:01:46] <coldhead> lol silvia10
[19:02:28] <domino141> im just trying to build up a dom tree with <div><ul><li>blah</li> ....
[19:02:45] <domino141> and i was doing it by $(element).append("<div>") and so forth
[19:02:48] <domino141> and it doesnt seem to be acting properly
[19:03:14] <domino141> if instead i just put the whole thing in as tring, then do $(element.)append(mystring) then it works properly. its just weird undocumented behavior
[19:06:06] <Coderah> domino141: sounds like its doing exactly what it should.. i have never tried to use append the way you are using it i don't think thats what it was intended for
[19:06:23] <Coderah> domino141: but i would still like to see a code example of what you are doing, it would certainly help me understand better
[19:07:31] <LocalPCGuy> domino141: append will obey DOM parser rules, so it won't create invalid HTML either...don't know if that is the problem, without seeing actual code, but it could be
[19:07:52] <RockMeAmadeus> I'm trying to submit a form w/out leaving the page, I was thinking of using a combo of .serialize, and .post ... do you know a more efficient way. I'm newish to jquery
[19:07:54] <Ellement> Codera: when you have finished helping domino141, can u please help me with autocomplete prob?
[19:08:26] <Coderah> Ellement: explain the problem here and if i or anyone else can help im sure they will :)
[19:08:28] <domino141> i mean that is basically the code
[19:08:30] <coldhead> RockMeAmadeus: i would use the convenient ajaxform plugin
[19:08:34] <coldhead> then you don't have to do anything
[19:08:38] <coldhead> it Just Works
[19:08:42] <domino141> i have rewritten it to use a string that i add to, then i append the whole thing, and it works now
[19:08:47] <LocalPCGuy> ? asking questions
[19:08:48] <domino141> so that must be the problem

The transition between phone and tablet is seamless, the HD graphics are incredible ZE4454 battery especially when you ... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ThinkPadGamers
[19:10:19] <LocalPCGuy> domino141: the problem isn't that it is a string vs. dom elements - you can create dom elements and then use append to add them.
[19:10:27] <Ellement> Coderah: i have autocomplete searchbox with html. when user clicks on link in autocomplete results, autcomplete ul dissapears and user isnt taken to link
[19:11:15] <domino141> LocalPCGuy: yes - but i was adding partial dom elements, like <div> <ul> and not adding the closing tags. so then it seemed to be closing them for me prior to adding further elements, screwing up the tree
[19:11:25] <Coderah> Ellement: you need to be more specific, what autocomplete plugin are you using? (jquery ui?) and also seeing a jsfiddle would probably get us there much faster
[19:12:25] <Coderah> LocalPCGuy: I believe he is trying to do something like $("#div").append("<div>").append("<ul>").append("<li>") and wants each element to be inside the one before it. domino141, is that correct?
[19:12:36] <LocalPCGuy> domino141 - that is as it should be, expected behavior.  If you do .append("<div>") that will create a full div
[19:12:52] <domino141> yes that is basically it Coderah, then at teh end i add the closing tags. but it's adding the closing tags for me earlier than that
[19:13:03] <RockMeAmadeus> cold head, is that the specific name of the plug in?
[19:13:19] <LocalPCGuy> Coderah: yup.  Domino141: no need to add the closing tags, you just need to append the proper elements in the proper order
[19:13:20] <Coderah> domino141: that is because each append is hitting that first $("#div") and append will only put in correct html
[19:13:29] <Ellement> Coderah: yeh jquery ui. ill get it on jsfiddle
[19:14:40] <Coderah> domino141: the way jQuery strings together functions is making it not append to the element before. each append is being ran on the first element. I am not sure how to do exactly what you want hopefully someone else can shed some light on this..
[19:14:53] <LocalPCGuy> domino141: you also may have to do some "wrapped" elements - $().append($("<div">).append($("<ul>").append("<li>blah</li>")))l
[19:15:02] <LocalPCGuy> basically like that
[19:15:13] <coldhead> RockMeAmadeus: that is the name
[19:15:16] <coldhead> here is a link, i hope
[19:15:19] <Coderah> LocalPCGuy: aye, i thought of that but it kind of destroys the simplicity of it
[19:15:23] <coldhead> ?g jquery ajaxform @ RockMeAmadeus

[19:15:25] <LocalPCGuy> I find it better to break up the chain myself
[19:15:27] <Coderah> LocalPCGuy: makes it so you have to wrap each element
[19:15:31] <coldhead> BINGO
[19:15:33] <coldhead> ?botsnack
[19:15:34] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[19:15:35] <intellilogic> RockMeAmadeus = winning name!!!
[19:15:36] <nathanw_>  $(".orderBtn").click(function () {       $("li.inactive").toggleClass("active");     });
[19:15:52] <domino141> Coderah: i did it by just making a string, like myHtml = "<div><ul>" and then add to it in a loop, then at the end of it all i do $("").append(myHtml)
[19:15:57] <domino141> seems to work ok
[19:16:06] <nathanw_> anyone know how to make that code target only the <lI> that is clicked ?
[19:16:07] <Coderah> domino141: yeah that is one way to do it.
[19:16:08] <RockMeAmadeus> thanks, just wanted to double check and make sure I didn't go and find some second rate plugin w/ a similar name
[19:16:34] <Coderah> nathanw_: $(this).toggleclass("active");
[19:16:48] <LocalPCGuy> domino141: it will work, probably not optimal if the list gets really large, but won't kill ya on smaller stuff
[19:17:05] <nathanw_> Coderah: thanks - my code structure is like this though.  <li><img src="orderBtn"></li>
[19:17:25] <nathanw_> Coderah: So I'm targeting the parent <li> from the button inside
[19:17:28] <Coderah> nathanw_: $(this).parent().toggleClass("active")
[19:17:33] <nathanw_> aha :D
[19:17:39] <Coderah> nathanw_: :)
[19:17:51] <nathanw_> i am learning
[19:17:57] <nathanw_> not knowing much at the moment though
[19:18:40] <RockMeAmadeus> Thanks #jquery for jquery.form.js, this saved me effort. I don't even have to think.
[19:19:01] <nathanw_> Coderah: ok that's almost working, except there is a few other elements inside the <li> like <p> etc, how to I go further up ?
[19:19:32] <Coderah> nathanw_: copy one of the <li> elements into a pastebin or something so i can see exactly how far you need to go
[19:19:33] <LocalPCGuy> nathanw_: .parents("li").eq(0)
[19:19:44] <Coderah> nathanw_: or use LocalPCGuy's method :)
[19:20:07] <nathanw_> can you explain .eq(0)
[19:20:08] <nathanw_> thanks
[19:20:08] <LocalPCGuy> that is assuming there isn't other LIs in between the ultimate goal
[19:20:13] <LocalPCGuy> ? eq
[19:20:13] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[19:20:19] <nathanw_> Local IP, nah there isn't
[19:20:45] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/VQ5TM/
[19:20:45] <Coderah> nathanw_: basically its getting the top-level li parent (index: 0)
[19:21:09] <LocalPCGuy> jquery gives you back an object with the matches of the selector - .eq() basically lets you select which element you want
[19:21:34] <LocalPCGuy> .eq(0) is the first element in the jQuery object
[19:21:41] <nathanw_> LocalPCGuy: thanks!!!!!!!!
[19:21:44] <nathanw_> working now
[19:21:44] <LocalPCGuy> np
[19:21:50] <LocalPCGuy> awesome
[19:22:02] <nathanw_> lots of other functions to add onclick but step one achieved :)
[19:23:08] <nathanw_> the other thing I need to do is toggle the read only attribute of some inputs inside the <li>
[19:23:36] <nathanw_> and swap the button image
[19:23:41] <nathanw_> but i can use toggle class for that
[19:31:29] <nathanw_> Coderah: if i want to set an input to readonly onclick as well.  $(this).parents(".qty").eq(0).attr('readonly', true);
[19:32:25] <Coderah> nathanw_: that should be correct assuming the input has the qty class
[19:32:48] <Eviltwin> Wait, what's the difference between .parents(".qty").eq(0) and .parent(".qty") ?
[19:32:54] <nathanw_> yepp
[19:33:05] <nathanw_> that's a good question eviltwin
[19:33:17] <Eviltwin> Oh, closest parent first
[19:33:23] <Coderah> Eviltwin: .parents(".qty").eq(0) gets the top-level element
[19:33:26] <Coderah> Eviltwin: not closest
[19:33:29] <LocalPCGuy> Eviltwin: parent only looks at the next one up
[19:33:32] <Coderah> Eviltwin: highest up the chain
[19:33:32] <LocalPCGuy> next element
[19:33:52] <Eviltwin> "the elements are returned in order from the closest parent to the outer ones"
[19:33:54] <Coderah> err not chain.. tree
[19:34:06] <LocalPCGuy> so if you have an li with a p with a link - and you check parent ("li") on the link, you will get 0 results
[19:34:07] <Coderah> Eviltwin: ah i am mistaken then
[19:34:26] <LocalPCGuy> parents will get all of the parents in the chain that match
[19:34:31] <LocalPCGuy> can be dangerous
[19:34:33] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[19:34:44] <Eviltwin> Dangerous?
[19:35:10] <Coderah> Eviltwin: dangroud in the sense that you could mess up your html if you don't pay attention
[19:35:14] <Coderah> dangerous*
[19:35:16] <LocalPCGuy> get a lot more results or higher than you intend
[19:35:33] <Coderah> or just end up with whatever you wanted in the wrong place
[19:35:37] <Coderah> is more accurate..
[19:35:46] <Eviltwin> As far as I can tell there's no difference between .parents("div").eq(0) and .parent("div")
[19:36:08] <LocalPCGuy> there is no difference IF the div is the next element up the chain
[19:36:09] <Coderah> Eviltwin: I think you are right actually.
[19:36:14] <LocalPCGuy> but only then
[19:36:37] <LocalPCGuy> if there is another containing element, .parent("div") will return 0 results
[19:36:58] <Coderah> LocalPCGuy: so you are saying $("span").parent("div") wouldnt work on <div><p><span>test</span></p></div>?
[19:37:04] <Eviltwin> Oh, I see
[19:37:05] <LocalPCGuy> right
[19:37:08] <Eviltwin> I hadn't read the page on .parent()
[19:37:13] <LocalPCGuy> ? parent
[19:37:14] <bot-t> .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[19:37:20] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I have it
[19:37:23] <LocalPCGuy> The .parents() and .parent() methods are similar, except that the latter only travels a single level up the DOM tree.
[19:38:15] <LocalPCGuy> closest is another one to look for if all you need is a single element, probably a better choice
[19:38:28] <Eviltwin> That's what I was thinking of
[19:38:37] <nathanw_> hmm
[19:38:42] <LocalPCGuy> closest("div") and parents("div").eq(0) should be functionally equivalent
[19:38:59] <Eviltwin> Someone was looking for a function that I couldn't find or find a good way of doing
[19:39:04] <Ellement> Coderah: sorry got disconnected. http://jsfiddle.net/VgnpR/2/
[19:39:36] <LocalPCGuy> ? closest
[19:39:36] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:39:38] <Eviltwin> Which was traverse from some element until you found the next one that matched a selector but not just siblings, in order traversal
[19:39:38] <nathanw_> hmmm readonly attribute not working
[19:40:33] <LocalPCGuy> nathanw_: .attr('readonly', true) ?
[19:40:37] <Eviltwin> nathanw_: .attr("readonly","readonly")?
[19:40:42] <LocalPCGuy> or that
[19:41:18] <nathanw_> actually need to use disabled, but same thing
[19:41:19] <LocalPCGuy> although you might be better off using .prop('readOnly', true)
[19:41:29] <nathanw_> .attr('readonly', true) - didn't work
[19:44:09] <LocalPCGuy> what version of jQuery nathanw_?
[19:44:25] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/T4b8H/4/
[19:44:57] <coldhead> RockMeAmadeus: now you get to think about harder things we don't have plugins for yet
[19:45:11] <nathanw_> using jquery 1.4.2
[19:45:47] <LocalPCGuy> k, just wondered if you were post 1.6
[19:45:48] <LocalPCGuy> or not
[19:46:19] <nathanw_> what i'm trying to do is , after button is clicked set .qty input to disabled
[19:47:59] <josespinal> Hi, how can I add a hash bang instead of just hash with jquery bqq?
[19:48:06] <josespinal> use*
[19:48:44] <Coderah> Ellement: see if this gets you where you need to be http://jsfiddle.net/VgnpR/7/ pay attention to what i did though. Your <a> element was not put in quotes properly and the source: was not as well
[19:50:30] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/T4b8H/11/
[19:51:37] <josespinal> anyone?
[19:53:56] <Coderah> nathanw_: http://jsfiddle.net/T4b8H/16/
[19:54:12] <Coderah> nathanw_: input.qty isnt a parent of the img
[19:55:02] <nathanw_> Coderah: thanks! but there are many elements on the one page? so won't we need to use parent ?
[19:55:02] <Ellement> Coderah: when still clicking on link, nothing happens :(
[19:55:34] <Ellement> Coderah: do i need to define something in 'select' attr?
[19:56:17] <Coderah> nathanw_: it uses it still
[19:56:24] <Coderah> nathanw_: i chained the events together
[19:56:29] <Coderah> err functions
[19:56:30] <Ellement> Coderah: i can right click 'open in new tab' and it works
[19:56:42] <nathanw_> oh
[19:57:28] <nathanw_> Coderah: so  $(".orderBtn").click(function () {      $(this).parents("li").eq(0)   <---- this finds .orderBtn and then moves up to the parent <li>
[19:58:22] <LocalPCGuy> you should probably use .closest("li") there instead of .parents("li").eq(0) btw
[19:58:34] <LocalPCGuy> my mistake earlier
[19:58:51] <LocalPCGuy> closest to go up, find to go down
[19:59:02] <nathanw_> LocalPCGuy: what's the difference between the two ?
[19:59:53] <LocalPCGuy> .parents("li") will get all of the li's above the element, so if there is only 1, none, but if there is it does more work because it gets them all then .eq(0) takes the first one
[20:00:10] <LocalPCGuy> whereas .closest will just stop at the first element that matches
[20:00:11] <nathanw_> yes there should only be one
[20:00:23] <nathanw_> but yes probably better/safer to use .closest
[20:00:24] <LocalPCGuy> but that is why .closest is better if you just want one
[20:00:57] <Coderah> nathanw_: yeah sorry for my delayed response thats corret.
[20:01:00] <Coderah> correct*
[20:01:03] <nathanw_> no worries :)
[20:01:16] <nathanw_> is there a way to make the .attr toggle like toggleClass?
[20:01:17] <LocalPCGuy> also, I would probably put the click event on the link, so you can prevent the default action
[20:01:41] <nathanw_> i already have this elsehwere
[20:01:41] <nathanw_> $(function() {   $("input, a").click(function() { 	   event.preventDefault();     }); });
[20:03:10] <nathanw_> found this, looks like it will do that http://jsfiddle.net/ifaour/SHynr/1/
[20:03:36] <LocalPCGuy> basically what you need to do
[20:03:53] <LocalPCGuy> I would insert the appropriate curly braces { } for the if and else statements
[20:04:00] <Coderah> Ellement: give me an example of what search.php returns
[20:04:00] <LocalPCGuy> (better practice)
[20:05:05] <solidus-river> within a live keypress listener function
[20:05:11] <solidus-river> does this always refer to the current element?
[20:05:59] <josh99> how do i fire an event from my objects? is it jquery related question?
[20:06:29] <Coderah> josh99: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[20:07:16] <Ellement> Coderah: [{"id":"1", "name":"foo"},{"id":"2", "name":"bar"}]
[20:07:28] <josh99> Coderah: thanks
[20:07:37] <Coderah> josh99: no problemo
[20:08:14] <LocalPCGuy> solidus-river: this will be the element the event is attached to
[20:08:33] <LocalPCGuy> $("a").live  --- this = the a element clicked
[20:08:37] <solidus-river> LocalPCGuy: cool, thanks :)
[20:09:00] <LocalPCGuy> might want to investigate .deligate() as well to scope the event listener
[20:09:15] <LocalPCGuy> delegate sorry
[20:09:18] <Coderah> Ellement: autocomplete auto hides the results when you click off, that is why they are disappearing and not taking you to the link
[20:09:35] <Coderah> can someone help with this i have never used jquery.ui.autocomplete http://jsfiddle.net/VgnpR/11/
[20:11:19] <daftspunk> Guys im trying to replace a string in the entire <body> of a page but it's causing events tied to that code to fail because of $('body').html(new_html); Is there any way to replace a string without resetting the entire body/dom content?
[20:11:47] <Ellement> Coderah: right ok
[20:12:49] <Coderah> daftspunk: what exactly are you trying to replace? there is probably a better method
[20:13:52] <daftspunk> Coderah: Say I wanna replace any occurance of "SITE NAME" with "Daftspunk's Site"
[20:15:11] <Coderah> daftspunk: well.. the only way i can think of doing this is to loop through each element and modifying the .html() of it, but that wouldn't get attributes as well. you could add those in though
[20:15:46] <rroelofs> Coderah, I think jquery.ui.autocomplete assumes source will be an array of strings ( or a url or a function )
[20:16:05] <daftspunk> Coderah:  That makes sense, loop each attribute, check if the magic word is actually in there, and replace the content in each element rather than the entire container?
[20:16:17] <Coderah> rroelofs: it is Ellement 's code try and help him please?
[20:16:27] <rroelofs> ohcibi, sorry
[20:16:47] <Coderah> daftspunk: exactly.. i can work up an example if you would like
[20:17:34] <daftspunk> Coderah: nah thats cool, i got the code working but it replaces everything in one fell swoop... i wish i could do a replace that doesn't require "rebuilding the dom"
[20:18:13] <Coderah> daftspunk: alright. yeah it isn't a usual request though so it makes sense that there isn't a good way of doing it lol
[20:18:22] <rroelofs> Ellement, If you are using a complex data structure you need to write a _renderItem function  check out http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[20:19:54] <LocalPCGuy> daftspunk you could also look into setting up your events so that replacing the dom doesn't destroy them (using .live or .delegate)
[20:20:26] <Spadeski> sup
[20:20:40] <daftspunk> LocalPCGuy: now you're talkin... i'll take a look thanks
[20:20:47] <Ellement> rroelofs: i thought i had. http://jsfiddle.net/VgnpR/11/
[20:26:35] <daftspunk> How about this: is there a way to perform a RegEx that will find the direct .parent() of the element that contains a match?
[20:26:50] <Ellement> rroelofs?
[20:26:53] <solidus-river> how do i test keypress events for enter but not shift + enter
[20:28:03] <nathanw_> LocalPCGuy: http://jsfiddle.net/T4b8H/19/ - what's the best way to add in a toggle class of the orderBtn element it's self before all the other functions have been rubn
[20:32:36] <luchenbill> how would I go about creating an image effect, where you click the image, and the screen will gray out, and display a larger image? kind of like lightbox or whatever?
[20:33:01] <luchenbill> I was going to use light box, but I see the plugin is like 1.4 mb and i'm very sure it does not use this much code to accomplish such a simple task
[20:36:19] <rroelofs> Ellement, autodomplete only looks in the label fields of your objects.  Since your objects don't have that it isn't finding them
[20:36:27] <solidus-river> found it, event.shiftKey
[20:38:06] <ExpFist> Man, does anyone know how to get a div to align vertically if it's in a div with 100% height?
[20:38:57] <rroelofs> Ellement, I'd forgotten that bit so it took me a minite to figure out what was wrong.
[20:39:10] <Spadeski> ExpFist display:inline ?
[20:41:26] <rroelofs> ExpFist, normally the first element inside the div will start at the top unless the div has padding or there are margin issues.
[20:42:25] <ExpFist> Anyway to change that?
[20:42:38] <ExpFist> I really need it to center
[20:42:48] <ExpFist> Horizontally I got that working, just not vertically
[20:43:40] <rroelofs> ExpFist,  Oh you want center?  if your inner element has a height specified, you can just do margin: auto and it will center vertically just like it does horiz
[20:43:59] <ExpFist> It doesn't have height specified. It's dynamically changing
[20:44:46] <ExpFist> It's a canvas that dynamically resizes based on the browser window, while maintaining ratio. If you squeeze in it pushes the canvas up
[20:44:58] <ExpFist> Out is fine since it centers horizontally
[20:47:48] <ExpFist> I hate CSS so much :F
[20:47:51] <rroelofs> ExpFist, I think you are stuck binding to the window resize event and calculating an absolute posiotin.  Keep in mind that you can set position relative on the containing div so you only have to clc wityhin that
[20:48:53] <rroelofs> ExpFist, Yeah, it wasn't designed for the stuff we are making it do.
[20:48:57] <ExpFist> Well I know the size of the canvas since that is set in js already
[20:49:34] <rroelofs> you can read the size of the container and to some math to set the top
[20:49:48] <rroelofs> of the canvas
[20:50:07] <ExpFist> oh you mean put a div above the canvas and set a fixed height dynamically?
[20:50:52] <rroelofs> ExpFist, that would work but isn't what I meant.  You can just position: absolute the canvas and set the top in js
[20:51:52] <rroelofs> you can keep your css margin: auto for the oriz centering
[20:52:19] <coldhead> oriz <3
[20:52:47] <rroelofs> Am I from London???
[20:53:45] <rroelofs> ExpFist, Actually, you could do a straight margin: auto; on the canvas and it should vertical center when you set the height of the canvas in js.
[20:55:57] <ExpFist> Ooh I see. Thanks that should work
[21:02:53] <Spadeski> How did that dude grey his background ?
[21:07:50] <ExpFist> Sweeet works perfectly :V
[21:08:01] <ExpFist> this.top = (this.viewportHeight - this.canvasHeight) / 2;
[21:18:39] <nathanw_> hey can anyone help  me execute this http://jsfiddle.net/T4b8H/23/ - ONLY if the value of an input is greater than 0 ?
[21:26:47] <josh99> i attach a handler to an event using bind and i try to trigger it and get: Foo is not a function. any ideas?
[21:33:09] <AphelionZ> So I finally got together a jsfiddle of the problem I'm facing. It's a jqtmpl problem: http://jsfiddle.net/THKe4/
[21:33:48] <AphelionZ> I think it's because {{ each }} in jquery templates is not the each that I'm used to
[21:45:16] <solidus-river> where can i find a definition of easing functions in jQuery?
[21:45:26] <objNoob> in my dragover event i want to prevent the parent container from accepting the draggable
[21:45:38] <objNoob> if($(e.target).parent()!=$(this)){
[21:46:05] <objNoob> but the block still fires.
[21:46:27] <objNoob> on the parent container
[21:46:57] <objNoob> Am I doing something wrong?
[21:48:53] <josh99> can someone tell me why bind doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/JqfTQ/
[21:49:02] <lng> hi! how do I add path to the coockie? https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[21:49:09] <lng> I don't understand
[21:50:04] <coldhead> josh99: i'm not sure you can bind to objects
[21:50:11] <coldhead> it doesn't seem to be documenter
[21:50:28] <josh99> coldhead: oh. so how do i fire my own events?
[21:50:43] <lng> I need curly braces!
[21:50:43] <coldhead> $('some-element').trigger()
[21:50:51] <coldhead> lng: you worked it out?
[21:51:28] <lng> coldhead: seams so :-)
[21:51:41] <coldhead> good work!
[21:51:50] <coldhead> objNoob: those are different objects
[21:52:25] <coldhead> maybe you need something more like if(! $(e.target).parent().is(this))
[21:52:37] <coldhead> i'm not sure that works but it's worth a shot!
[21:52:49] <objNoob> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/YUQeFkz1  Thats my code.
[21:52:51] <lng> coldhead: I cannot delete cookie - it appears on page again and again
[21:53:09] <lng> coldhead: it's deleted on page 1, then it appears on page 2
[21:53:18] <coldhead> objNoob: so try the .is() thing
[21:53:26] <coldhead> $(this) != $(this)
[21:53:36] <coldhead> you can't compare objects like that
[21:53:44] <objNoob> Ahh,,,
[21:54:01] <coldhead> lng: show us your code
[21:54:11] <lng> mmt
[21:54:12] <objNoob> Gotcha. Thanks. Will the try the is method
[21:54:23] <josh99> coldhead: this is my situation - i want my object to trigger event so other object that listen to it will get it.
[21:54:49] <coldhead> jQuery won't let you do that AFAIK, josh99
[21:55:00] <coldhead> you need something like react.js or backbone or something
[21:55:11] <coldhead> an event system independent of DOM events
[21:55:28] <josh99> coldhead: oh
[21:55:35] <coldhead> josh99: or you can just bind and trigger off $(document), maybe
[21:55:36] <coldhead> total hack
[21:55:41] <coldhead> but it might get you there
[21:56:05] <josh99> ok
[21:57:00] <victrolla> can anyone help me figure out where I can find or how to google for a separated progress bar. something like this: http://www.fedex.com/Tracking/track/images/detail/progress_delivered_ltr.gif
[21:57:55] <ZooZoo> which  methods that change alpha values onmouseover?
[21:57:56] <objNoob> coldhead: is(this) works like a charm.
[21:59:14] <objNoob> coldhead: I'm new to jQuery, and I've been fighting the condition for the past hour trying all different things. Never came across the is method on jquery.com. Thanks again!
[22:00:23] <coldhead> i'm glad it worked out, objNoob
[22:00:37] <coldhead> i'm pretty new to jQuery too but i've learned a lot from lurking here
[22:01:09] <objNoob> Ya, I might move in :p
[22:02:54] <coldhead> i'm sure you're welcome to
[22:03:06] <lng> coldhead: I worked this out as well
[22:04:07] <coldhead> have a nice cookie as a reward, lng
[22:04:19] <RockMeAmadeus> If I create an element dynamically, and load it in a dialog, how do I add listeners to the element
[22:04:31] <lng> coldhead: haha))
[22:04:35] <lng> thanks
[22:05:21] <coldhead> ?live @ RockMeAmadeus
[22:05:22] <bot-t> RockMeAmadeus, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[22:05:30] <huntedmitch> This might be a stupid question, but is there a way jQuery can detect if a background image has failed to load?
[22:05:32] <coldhead> emphasis on the IN THE FUTURE part
[22:05:36] <RockMeAmadeus> thanks coldhead
[22:06:12] <coldhead> might be something in modernizr to test that, huntedmitch
[22:06:45] <coldhead> or you could maybe try new Image(); img.src = 'thingy'; and see if the load handler fires
[22:07:46] <AphelionZ> can anybody tell me what crucial piece of this jqTmpl thing I am missing? http://jsfiddle.net/THKe4/
[22:08:10] <coldhead> huntedmitch: http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-en/msg/5f864236cdddad4e
[22:09:36] <huntedmitch> coldhead: Cool. So presumable I could perhaps do <div data-bgimage="/path/to/image.jpg">, test if image exists, if it does set it as the background image, if it doesn't kill it?
[22:09:44] <coldhead> AphelionZ: http://jsfiddle.net/THKe4/1/
[22:10:01] <coldhead> you don't want $id, id alone is the thing
[22:10:20] <coldhead> and you don't seem to have a "value" to output
[22:10:39] <coldhead> huntedmitch: yeah, that's the best approach i can think of
[22:10:45] <AphelionZ> its just weird because it iterates twice which is the desired result
[22:10:53] <huntedmitch> Sweet, thanks man
[22:10:54] <AphelionZ> but it just doesnt have anything in the object its iterative over...?
[22:11:07] <coldhead> i think the $ inside the ${} is confusing to jqtmpl
[22:11:11] <coldhead> as are many many things
[22:11:19] * huntedmitch starts a fresh jsfiddle
[22:19:23] <flint0131> guys do you know what's the name of that plugin, a sticky box that sticks only when the top window hits it?
[22:19:49] <flint0131> not top window, top side of the window.
[22:20:42] <coldhead> and the vaguest description of the day award goes to...
[22:20:52] <coldhead> flint0131: something like this? http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1810-Creating-A-Sometimes-Fixed-Position-Element-With-jQuery.htm
[22:24:19] <flint0131> coldhead: FFFFUUUUU no demo thanks for the award ^_^
[22:24:28] <RockMeAmadeus> stoked is a great show
[22:24:35] <RockMeAmadeus> Sorry
[22:24:37] <RockMeAmadeus> wrong channel
[22:25:16] <coldhead> flint0131: there's a demo in the video
[22:25:38] <coldhead> you have to wait a while to see it but you get to enjoy ben nadel's dulcet tones
[22:25:51] <coldhead> it's hardly time wasted
[22:25:51] <objNoob> coldhead: that trying to prevent dragging back onto original container didn't work so well. it messed with event bubbling.
[22:26:05] <coldhead> oh god, objNoob
[22:26:32] <objNoob> coldhead: instead on dragstart i unbind dragover from the parent container.
[22:26:32] <nathanw_> hey can anyone help me create an if statement
[22:26:43] <nathanw_> need to execute some code if the value of an input is greater than 0
[22:26:48] <nathanw_> or throw an error if not
[22:27:31] <objNoob> your using jquery for that?
[22:27:38] <objNoob> nathanw_: ?
[22:29:45] <huntedmitch> coldhead: .load() doesn't have a failure status?
[22:30:01] <flint0131> coldhead: thanks, that's what I'm looking for.
[22:30:15] <nathanw_> yes
[22:30:17] <nathanw_> sorry
[22:30:52] <coldhead> huntedmitch: not really :\
[22:30:55] <nathanw_> objNoob : http://jsfiddle.net/T4b8H/29/
[22:31:12] <nathanw_> just need to execute after the onclick - only if .qty value is greater than 0
[22:31:19] <coldhead> huntedmitch: you have to reverse the logic, tell it what to do if it succeeds, and assume you'll never hear anything if it fails
[22:31:22] <huntedmitch> coldhead: So I can only test for success on that. I can't even set a variable inside the closure :-
[22:31:28] <coldhead> nathanw_: http://jsfiddle.net/AHQvC/
[22:31:43] <huntedmitch> coldhead: Yeah, I'll set a default bg image and only change it if it works :-)
[22:31:48] <coldhead> right
[22:31:58] <coldhead> success is much more narrowly defined than failure :
[22:32:01] <coldhead> :(
[22:32:32] <nathanw_> coldhead: thanks! should be able to work it out from that!
[22:32:45] <coldhead> that's what i was hoping :)
[22:32:52] <objNoob> nathanw_: Do KEYUP
[22:33:38] <coldhead> he's doing it on a click
[22:35:13] <nathanw_> objNoob: yeah there's a few other things happening onclick of a button
[22:37:35] <objNoob> nathanw_: it makes no sence... on keyup  11 should turn green, but it doesn't
[22:38:17] <objNoob> 1 keyup > 10 === false   .... 1 keyup > 10 === true                            11 being > 10
[22:38:31] <objNoob> its not executing in that fashion tho.
[22:38:58] <coldhead> objNoob: that was just a demo
[22:39:08] <coldhead> it works better with keyup
[22:39:15] <coldhead> at keydown it only has the old value
[22:39:18] <objNoob> Yes, but when I switch your demo to keyup, it still doesn't work
[22:39:22] <coldhead> the new char isn't inserted yet
[22:39:27] <coldhead> well it works fine for me
[22:39:35] <coldhead> AND NO ONE EVEN WANTS THIS STUPID FIDDLE
[22:39:40] <coldhead> IF I COULD DELTE IT I WOULD
[22:40:02] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/AHQvC/7/
[22:40:20] <nathanw_> I've put the code i'm working with in there
[22:40:30] <objNoob> coldhead: I see, I wasn't hitting the update button.
[22:41:00] <punno> hey all, im having problems with live('keyup') not working in firefox 5 or ie - is there a good cross browser alternative?
[22:41:28] <punno> its an input field so change only triggers on blur which isnt ideal for this, i need the event to fire every time the value of the input box is changed
[22:42:02] <objNoob> coldhead: yeah, I've never seen fiddle before.
[22:42:10] <nathanw_> coldhead: just having trouble its not recognizing the value of .qty
[22:42:13] <objNoob> coldhead: kinda neeto
[22:44:20] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/AHQvC/14/
[22:45:50] <coldhead> this works okay for me, nathanw_
[22:46:00] <coldhead> are you sure your > is the right way around?
[22:46:12] <coldhead> i also suggest changing $('.qty') to $('input.qty')
[22:46:15] <nathanw_> coldhead: nope lol
[22:46:25] <nathanw_> value "greater than" 0
[22:46:29] <coldhead> so it doesn't get the val() of a div called qty
[22:46:43] <nathanw_> as far as i can tell it only throws the alert
[22:48:00] <coldhead> nathanw_: try entering a negative number in the field
[22:48:16] <coldhead> i think your > is backwards
[22:49:15] <nathanw_> coldhead: still throws alert
[22:49:31] <coldhead> good grief man, what have you done
[22:49:54] <coldhead> $('qty').val(); ?
[22:50:00] <coldhead> that will match <qty> tags
[22:50:05] <coldhead> which do not exist
[22:50:15] <coldhead> $('input.qty') is what you want
[22:50:28] <nathanw_> :( sorry
[22:50:39] <coldhead> don't be sorry!
[22:50:42] <nathanw_> reload
[22:50:43] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/AHQvC/20/
[22:50:44] <coldhead> just DON'T EVER LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN
[22:50:48] <nathanw_> haha :D
[22:52:49] <nathanw_> coldhead: do you see the ' $(this).closest("li").eq(0)' ?
[22:53:09] <coldhead> nathanw_: http://jsfiddle.net/AHQvC/23/
[22:53:20] <coldhead> you were missing .val()
[22:53:25] <coldhead> and then after all that hard work
[22:53:31] <coldhead> you were using $(this).value > 0
[22:53:35] <coldhead> which is nonsense
[22:53:37] <objNoob> coldhead: this drag and drop is getting messing =[
[22:53:53] <coldhead> objNoob: this is why i don't care for jquery UI
[22:53:57] <coldhead> too gomblicated
[22:54:14] <objNoob> I'm using html5 drag and drop.
[22:54:39] <coldhead> oh god
[22:54:45] <coldhead> even scarier
[22:54:57] <coldhead> you're very brace
[22:54:59] <coldhead> brave*
[22:55:01] <coldhead> sheesh
[22:55:32] <nathanw_> coldhead: that works great thanks
[22:55:33] <objNoob> coldhead: Im going to try the original !is() but work with originalEvent to see if that doesn't hinder the event bubbling
[22:55:41] <nathanw_> coldhead: can you explain what I was doing wrong /
[22:56:02] <coldhead> objNoob: the even bubbling is more likely to do with return false or stopPropogation than with the comparison
[22:56:08] <coldhead> nathanw_: see above
[22:56:19] <coldhead> also paste your version into paste.pocoo.org
[22:56:23] <coldhead> and then paste mine
[22:56:26] <coldhead> and compare the diff
[22:56:30] <coldhead> in fact let me do that
[22:56:45] <nathanw_> sure
[22:57:48] <coldhead> nathanw_: http://paste.pocoo.org/compare/487539/487538/
[22:57:53] <nathanw_> coldhead: this is where i'm implementing it.. http://www.microhire.com/pacific2012
[22:57:55] <coldhead> the lines i changed are the bugs
[22:58:10] <nathanw_> coldhead: thanks
[22:58:32] <nathanw_> coldhead: it works intermittently
[22:58:45] <coldhead> that's good enough for me!
[22:58:46] <coldhead> ?cc
[22:58:47] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[23:00:12] <nathanw_> coldhead: seems like it works once on the list
[23:01:17] <coldhead> if you have a lot of fields with class="qty" you will have to help jQuery find the one you mean
[23:01:51] <nathanw_> coldhead: thats what i was using $(this).closest("li").eq(0) fir
[23:01:53] <nathanw_> for*
[23:02:08] <nathanw_> coldhead: because all elements are contained in a <li>
[23:02:18] <De|work> goodmorning
[23:02:31] <nathanw_> afternoon
[23:03:03] <Deele> +2GMT here :)
[23:08:21] <nathanw_> +10GMT (actually maybe +11 now daylight savings :)  )
[23:09:40] <coldhead> nathanw_: $(this).closest('li').find('input.qty').val()
[23:11:26] <hasenj> say I have a jquery object 'jq', can I remove elements with a certain class from 'jq'? (not from the DOM, just from the list inside 'jq')
[23:12:11] <coldhead> jq.not('.someclass')
[23:12:19] <coldhead> ?not @ hasenj
[23:12:20] <bot-t> hasenj, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[23:12:25] <rickup> I have a script (well 2) that clear this complicated form and it takes a few seconds.... http://jsfiddle.net/GwbcZ/  Can anyone suggest an effect like a progress indicator?
[23:13:20] <hasenj> thanks, coldhead
[23:13:32] <rickup> I tried some alerts but I realized the scripts would get even more complicated if I display accurate info like what they are changing
[23:15:58] <context> is there a way to test if $(this) matches another field manually pulled from an id/class/etc
[23:16:46] <context> ie: $(this) == $(this).closest('.something').find('.blah')
[23:18:36] <nathanw_> coldhead: fiddled a bit, seems to be working now thanks!
[23:19:32] <Spadeski> sup us p
[23:19:32] <Spadeski> sup sup *
[23:19:58] <Trisox> var closest = $(this).closest('.something');  if ($(this) == closest){ closest.find('blah');} sure that would work
[23:20:24] <Trisox> morning coldie
[23:21:11] <nathanw_> coldhead: one more thing, my code structure is like this. <li><p>product name</p><input class="qty><a href="#" class="orderBtn"></a></li>
[23:21:47] <nathanw_> coldhead: you've seen the JS for the orderBtn click function - also onclick I want to pass the contents of the paragraph and qty input into a select option below
[23:22:20] <Spadeski> Anyone wanna help me with a image croppin tool
[23:23:29] <nathanw_> so the select is empty at the moment but ideally, after the button is clicked it would have <select><option>3x Product Name</option></select>
[23:28:20] <veera> Hellu, this may sound basic, but how do i check if an attribute is equal to a specific text?
[23:28:35] <Trisox> Spadeski: you need php or any other backend system for that...
[23:28:56] <Trisox> there is alot of info about it online
[23:28:57] <Trisox> http://www.webmotionuk.co.uk/php-jquery-image-upload-and-crop/
[23:29:04] <Spadeski> Trisox got that part just updating and making sure its secure is what i need
[23:29:05] <Trisox> you do need the right libs
[23:29:19] <objNoob> how can I get a child by index?
[23:29:34] <Trisox> that is nothing to do with jquery more with the programming channel
[23:29:35] <coldhead> hiya Trisox
[23:29:36] <punno> has anyone run into problems using custom trigger() events in IE?
[23:29:44] <Trisox> check php channel if you use it
[23:29:49] <Spadeski> Trisox your stupid dont chat
[23:31:26] <veera> I found how to do it
[23:31:29] <veera> thanks anyway
