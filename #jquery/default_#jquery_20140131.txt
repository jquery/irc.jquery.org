[00:24:52] <fhemberger> hi. I found a XSS issue in jquery (still exists in 1.11.0). where should i report it? should I post it to the forums directly?
[00:27:07] <Cork> fhemberger: xss in jquery?
[00:27:20] <Cork> jquery doesn't implement any xss protections
[00:27:38] <xtianus> hello anyone here?
[00:27:38] <Cork> the protection that exists is in the browser
[00:27:46] <fhemberger> Cork: when parsing html strings, code gets immediately executed.
[00:27:57] <Cork> ya?
[00:28:08] <xtianus> can you help me with a jquery plugin
[00:28:13] <Cork> ?ask
[00:28:13] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:28:19] <xtianus> it will not worked.  i am certain I did it correctly
[00:28:40] <Cork> fhemberger: if you don't want to allow inline js, add csp headers to the site
[00:28:45] <xtianus> sometimes people aren't here... but cool thanks
[00:28:55] <fhemberger> Cork: there are safe wys to evaluate HTML without directly triggering included scrips.
[00:29:01] <xtianus> http://curtisj.trafficflo.net/
[00:29:07] <xtianus> I have a mega menu plugin
[00:29:12] <Cork> xtianus: well it is expected that you might need to repeat the question
[00:29:34] <Cork> fhemberger: like i said, that it up to the developer/site to handle
[00:29:42] <fhemberger> Cork: I know about CSP, but that's not the point.
[00:30:01] <xtianus> it is suppposed to take the menu <li> tag and make it go from display none to display block when hovered over
[00:30:05] <Cork> fhemberger: the execution of scripts is intentional
[00:30:21] <xtianus> it will not load the jquery... i have done everything correctly
[00:30:48] <Cork> and like i said it is the site developers responsibility to validate the safety of the html it is about to append to the page
[00:30:54] <xtianus> the demo works perfctly
[00:31:49] <Cork> xtianus: little warning be careful with ---------------------------- in comments
[00:32:10] <Cork> as those are actually a HUGE range of comment start and comment end
[00:32:50] <Cork> xtianus: where is the code you need help with?
[00:32:52] <xtianus> is that my problem?
[00:33:02] <Cork> well not in modern browsers
[00:33:20] <xtianus> http://curtisj.trafficflo.net/templates/rt_paradigm/js/jetmenu.js
[00:33:24] <Cork> but olders that don't support the new updated comment spec it is problematic
[00:33:45] <xtianus> i think the code is fine
[00:33:48] <Cork> <!-- comment -- not a comment -- comment -- not a comment -- comment -- not a comment --> comment
[00:34:36] <xtianus> for some reason there is something that is preventing the jquery from "catching" the class
[00:35:07] <Cork> uh... $().jetmenu(); ?!?
[00:35:12] <xtianus> the class is jetmenu
[00:35:16] <xtianus> yes
[00:35:16] <Cork> you forgot the selector
[00:35:42] <Cork> or you should change jQuery.fn.jetmenu = function(options) to jQuery.jetmenu = function(options)
[00:35:46] <Cork> and do $.jetmenu();
[00:35:50] <xtianus> var menu = $(".jetmenu");
[00:36:03] <Cork> also your missing the plugin wrapper
[00:36:14] <Cork> (function($) {})(jQuery);
[00:36:31] <Cork> ugg gtg
[00:36:35] <xtianus> wait
[00:36:45] <xtianus> where are you seeing this at?
[00:37:50] <xtianus> are you still here cork?
[00:40:03] <xtianus> can anyone else help?
[00:40:59] <xtianus> anyone else here?
[00:43:40] <xtianus> hello
[00:43:47] <xtianus> what is a plugin wrapper?
[00:49:39] <xtianus> hi
[00:49:41] <xtianus> anywhere here
[01:01:05] <fabioportieri> hello, i'm quite desperate in how to make preserve-3d work in ie10 too.. any help?
[01:01:37] <fabioportieri> even the dirtiest workaround will do
[01:11:25] <fabioportieri> http://jsfiddle.net/yf5bL/3/
[01:16:13] <PatBateman> hi
[01:16:24] <PatBateman> can I embed two setTimeouts ?
[01:28:29] <Cork> PatBateman2: embed?
[01:28:42] <Cork> you can start as many timeouts as you want
[01:29:43] <PatBateman2> ok
[01:33:18] <PatBateman2> now working
[01:33:26] <Cork> what isn't working?
[02:10:43] <PatBateman2> is it possible to give a delay when i hover off from a div?
[02:12:30] <fabioportieri> PatBateman2: maybe you want something like this? http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[02:13:08] <PatBateman2> thx checking
[02:50:33] <lemonsparrow> can some one help me with this issue http://pastebin.com/8pYt5c5k
[02:54:05] <lemonsparrow> http://pastebin.com/8pYt5c5k
[02:54:51] <Cork> lemonsparrow: .text() will replace the content of the element when you run it
[02:55:07] <Cork> use append instead
[02:55:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: tried both... still div not appearing
[02:55:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can you correct it
[02:55:54] <Cork> $('<td>').html($('<div>').text(obj.sumVotes)).append("Votes Recorded")
[02:56:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[02:59:06] <lemonsparrow> Cork: cool worked... thanks :)

[03:09:56] <SprkDev> I want to check the that the comment actually belongs to the logged in user before he can delete it. I've managed to do this purely with php. But it breaks and doesnt work with jquery ajax.
[03:12:33] <Cork> SprkDev: that code is still doing all the logic in php
[03:13:09] <Cork> and i don't see you ever checking the user in js at all
[03:23:26] <doebi> i tried to setup the jquery form validator plugin, but it aint working
[03:23:44] <doebi> and the docs dont really tell me what steps it takes to get it working
[03:24:14] <doebi> so far i included, jquery, the plugin itself, and initialized the validation using .ready()
[03:36:58] <jomofcw> Hello :) !
[03:37:41] <jomofcw> I would like to add an element before each element of a list of matched element, what's the easiest way to do it please ?
[03:38:52] <lemonsparrow> any better way to do this ?
[03:38:52] <lemonsparrow> $('<td>').css({'valign':'top'})append('<img align="absmiddle" style="margin-right:5px" src="/admin/assets/img/icon-date.png"><b>Start Date:</b>').appendTo($tr);
[03:40:01] <Cork> ?api before @ jomofcw
[03:40:01] <b-ot> jomofcw: .before(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
[03:40:35] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ya, you could move the css into the css files
[03:41:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no I was asking about the img ?
[03:41:17] <Cork> if you want an img tag you need to add it
[03:43:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork: as u can see now I have just added it as it is... can I build itusing jquery ?
[03:43:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: and embed into it ?
[03:43:51] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you can build it using dom elements sure, but it will be more code and be slower
[03:45:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[03:45:42] <lemonsparrow> $('<td>').append('<td style=""><input type="hidden" onchange="$(\'#fDate\').html(this.value)" id="datepickerStart" value="01/30/14" class="hasDatepicker" style=""><img class="ui-datepicker-trigger" src="assets/css/ui-lightness/images/calendar.png" alt="Select Start Date" title="Select Start Date"></td>').appendTo($tr);
[03:45:46] <lemonsparrow> Cork: what abt this ?
[03:45:54] <lemonsparrow> Cork: chance for optimizing ?
[03:46:05] <Cork> ...
[03:46:23] <Cork> for the nths time... move the js out of your js-html strings
[03:46:42] <Cork> use event listeners instead
[03:46:57] <Cork> and have at least semi manageable code
[03:46:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I don't know... can you show an example.. out of this ?
[03:47:04] <Cork> ?.on
[03:47:07] <Cork> ?api on
[03:47:08] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:48:46] <jomofcw> OK Cork thanks ! Was thinking that before just add before the first element.
[03:49:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: on is to do something upon some event right ?
[03:49:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: here I am building the entire page (DOM) over jquery...
[03:50:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: .on is basically the same as the old .bind function
[03:53:28] <Whiskey> $(".Info" + "td").css("width", "100") does all tds get 100px in .Info class?
[03:53:44] <Whiskey> i can¬¥t see why i have big problemsto understand how to apply rules whit jQuert
[03:53:52] <Whiskey> "jQuery"
[03:54:05] <Cork> all tds with a parent of .Info will have width: 100px set on the element yes
[03:54:40] <Cork> it won't modify any rules though
[03:54:41] <Whiskey> $(".Info" + "td").css("width", variable); like that then
[03:54:52] <Cork> oh wait no
[03:54:59] <Cork> 100 isn't the same as 100px
[03:55:09] <Whiskey> maybe
[03:55:09] <Cork> you most likely want to use .width() instead
[03:55:13] <Cork> ?api width
[03:55:13] <b-ot> Cork: .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/
[03:55:27] <Whiskey> $(".Info" + "td").css("width", variable + "px"); like that then
[03:55:33] <Cork> no
[03:55:38] <Cork> see the link
[03:56:01] <Whiskey> it get widths of elemets i try to set a width
[03:56:05] <Cork> $(".Info" + "td") <-- and this will look for elements with the class "Infotd"
[03:57:39] <Whiskey> yeh but you know what i try to do
[03:57:57] <Whiskey> .Info is a table whit alot of TDs i will apply px to every td in that table
[03:58:09] <Cork> i suspect you want $(".Info td").width(variable);
[03:58:21] <Whiskey> hmmm
[04:04:32] <Whiskey> it did not work as i was hoping anyways it did what i espected
[04:12:43] <Whiskey> Cork, can¬¥t relly not pull this crap off :/
[04:13:25] <Whiskey> but its more CSS then JS now i think
[04:13:40] <Whiskey> even if its can be fixed whit js but its uggly CSS would be nice :)
[04:17:12] <miCSu> I'm trying to use $("input[type='radio']:checked").click(function(){ $(this).prop('checked',false); }); but after single uncheck I can't check the same one anymore
[04:18:32] <Cork> miCSu: the selector isn't a live selector
[04:18:51] <Cork> you will bind a click handler to the radio button that is checked when the selector runs
[04:18:52] <miCSu> right
[04:18:56] <Cork> and all the other ones won't
[04:19:12] <Cork> you should bind a delegated event listener to a parent instead
[04:19:37] <Cork> $('parent').on('click', "input[type='radio']:checked", func)
[04:20:02] <Cork> (where you replace parent with a selector that matches a parent of the input elements)
[04:20:07] <Whiskey> Cork: i try to keep the lines equal sized http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/6QCcK/1/ its really hard you can set the TableWidth(".Info") in there to get it, but then table change size two times, first for the one that change size, and then fix up the other one, and thats uggly, i can¬¥t find away to do it on both in smae time
[04:20:49] <Whiskey> Maybe not possible, but the way it is now its not nice :/
[04:33:36] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/m9a3fNuu  for some reason the button and the selector dont connect
[04:34:35] <miCSu> Cork: now I can't check any of the inputs
[04:34:57] <Cork> miCSu: please share the html and js in jsfiddle.net
[04:35:30] <Cork> SprkDev: look at the generated js and then compare that to the generated html
[04:35:56] <Cork> SprkDev: it is close to impossible to not miss things when you have two codes running in each other
[04:44:19] <miCSu> Cork: figured it out.. I was using $(this) instead of $("input[type='radio']:checked",this) in function
[04:44:35] <Cork> miCSu: no you shouldn't need to do that
[04:44:45] <Cork> miCSu: if you do you arn't using a delegated event listener
[04:44:52] <Cork> the second argument to on
[04:45:08] <miCSu> http://jsfiddle.net/qTMv2/
[04:45:51] <miCSu> could it be because so old version of jquery?
[04:46:02] <Whiskey> Cork, the only way i found is to change style in two steps, i would like to do it in 1step only
[04:46:48] <Cork> miCSu: yes, you would need to use .delegate in a version older then 1.9
[04:46:58] <Cork> ?g jquery delegate
[04:47:00] <SprkDev> Need help with a simple but weird issue of connection a button with a jquery selector click function. It should fire only when the button is clicked. But it doesn't work for some reason.  http://pastebin.com/m9a3fNuu
[04:47:00] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation ‚Üí http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:54:21] <lemonsparrow> I have a div and inside it a table.. I want it append another table inside div below first table... how to do it in jquery ?
[04:55:12] <miCSu> Cork: still not working http://jsfiddle.net/qTMv2/1/
[04:56:12] <Cork> miCSu: works here
[04:56:56] <miCSu> Cork: try to check something
[04:57:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ^
[04:57:22] <miCSu> seems like it does uncheck to any clicked
[04:57:30] <Cork> though that said, checked will always be true
[04:57:53] <Cork> miCSu: cause cause the radio gets checked
[04:57:58] <lemonsparrow> .after()
[04:58:27] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ya
[04:59:20] <SprkDev> help? :-(
[05:00:04] <Cork> miCSu: best option might be to use checkboxes instead of radio?
[05:00:18] <Cork> radio boxes isn't ever meant to be all unchecked
[05:02:01] <Cork> SprkDev: again, render out the php and have a look at the result
[05:02:22] <Cork> SprkDev: it is easy to miss things when you have two languages running one over the other
[05:02:54] <bl4ckdu5t> I used flexslider plugin for my carousel and the images are too large. I tried resizing the images smaller but they still occupy the same large area. Does anyone have a clue on how to handle this plugin?
[05:05:12] <miCSu> Cork: I know they aren't ment to be unchecked, but there's some 700 lines on the actual page where you estimate your own knowledge so it's kinda sad if you click a line you shouldn't by mistake
[05:05:18] <miCSu> but I'll work something else out
[05:05:32] <bl4ckdu5t> Here's how the carousel looks on the web page http://imgur.com/vWDUax3 and I want it to be smaller
[05:05:41] <Cork> miCSu: well only option for you to get the effect you want is:
[05:06:08] <Cork> 1. store the default value on a data-checked variable (or similar)
[05:06:10] <SprkDev> well right now I have fixed the php issue. What is remaining is purely a jquery issue. What is happening right now is this. I have php check for backend, only if the comment author is logged in can the comment be actually deleted. But on the front-end I have jquery remove, so I don't want this to happen either (even though upon rerfresh the removed comment comes back if not the comment...
[05:06:10] <bl4ckdu5t> The width is ok but I'll like to reduce the height
[05:06:12] <SprkDev> ...authour due to the php condition).
[05:06:43] <Cork> 2. on each click the last thing you do loop all the elements and update there checked state
[05:06:59] <Cork> 3. use the data-checked attribute instead of the checked property
[05:07:11] <Cork> as the checked property can't give you the old value you want
[05:08:36] <SprkDev> So how can I disabled jquery remove from front end if I need php check for comment owner backend?
[05:09:26] <Cork> SprkDev: if you need php to run from js you need to do an ajax call from front end to a backend script that tells it
[05:09:49] <Cork> SprkDev: though just setting an identifyer on the element to give a hint to js should be enough
[05:10:07] <Cork> SprkDev: the backend has to validate it when the actual removal happens anyway
[05:13:36] <SprkDev> the good thing if the validation for the actual removal is already happening. Which is why upon refresh it comes back.
[05:13:53] <SprkDev> my problem is with the remove that happens in frontend.
[05:14:04] <Cork> then you can only use ajax
[05:14:16] <Cork> so on the removal request you need to fire an ajax call to the server
[05:14:36] <Cork> and in the success callback from the server remove the element if you are allowed to
[05:16:00] <shoky> miCSu here's a slight variation on Cork's suggestion http://jsfiddle.net/qTMv2/3/
[05:16:24] <shoky> no need for .delegate in 1.7  btw
[05:17:10] <Cork> interesting...
[05:17:18] <Cork> i could have sworn it landed in 1.9...
[05:17:46] <shoky> heh, probably confusing with something else?
[05:17:50] <Cork> ya
[05:17:56] <Cork> not sure what though >_<
[05:18:00] <shoky> HM
[05:41:46] <PatBateman> do you suggest using require js ? what pro can I get using it?
[05:49:26] <ShawnRisk> hi

[05:56:13] <lemonsparrow> according to this answer will .on() function only work when the user clicks ?
[05:56:21] <lemonsparrow> somewhere in the page
[05:57:29] <fabioportieri> lemonsparrow:  ?
[06:11:32] <ShawnRisk> on this site: http://www.wadevs.com/Music You see the list in the second section starting with Clockwork?  When you click clockwork that should play in the audio player below.  How do I get this to play on Moblie phones?
[06:25:52] <myosotis> t
[06:32:37] <ShawnRisk> seems quiet
[06:35:26] <Vivekananda> dont know jquery very well and trying to learn by doing. here is something I am trying to achieve using examples but not sure how to proceed to troubleshoot https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8733113
[06:45:22] <ShawnRisk> :(
[06:49:14] <decx> ShawnRisk doesnt even play on desktop when i click clockword
[06:49:37] <decx> why not just have the audio embed. the giant playbutton on mobile isnt good enough?
[06:50:23] <ShawnRisk> decx: browser?
[06:50:45] <decx> ff & chrome
[06:51:40] <decx> same behaviour on ff&chrome on mobile as on desktop here
[06:52:01] <ShawnRisk> decx: works for me.  Only the Clockwork works.  You are clicking on the list on the left side?
[06:52:27] <decx> oh i clicked on the clockword title xD
[06:53:33] <prtksxna> Is there a cleaner way to write element.removeClass("a b").addClass(condition ? "a" : "b") ?
[06:54:26] <ShawnRisk> decx: you see the issue now?
[06:54:54] <decx> yeah but audioplayer.js isnt exactly straight forward enough for me to quickly debug
[06:55:07] <ShawnRisk> decx: oh :O
[06:55:23] <ShawnRisk> decx: can I pm you?
[06:55:34] <decx> no i'm working

[06:57:02] <ShawnRisk> hi BillCriswell
[07:00:17] <BillCriswell> ShawnRisk: Ayyyy
[07:00:36] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: how are you?
[07:02:15] <BillCriswell> Can't complain. You?
[07:04:22] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: havve to leave very soon but having trouble with the same site
[07:04:38] <BillCriswell> Is that the one with the spinny image?
[07:05:14] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: yes
[07:05:22] <BillCriswell> What is the issue?
[07:05:59] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: on this site: http://www.wadevs.com/Music You see the list in the second section starting with Clockwork?  When you click clockwork that should play in the audio player below.  How do I get this to play on Moblie phones (iPhone from tests)?
[07:06:31] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: the other one is a css issue.
[07:06:36] <ShawnRisk> I need to leave in 5 mins
[07:10:01] <ShawnRisk> BillCriswell: I will be back on later, I have to go
[07:14:45] <Lynnwood> greetings all. I've got a very basic question that's driving me batty.  I'm passing an object reference to a function, so the function definition starts like this:
[07:14:47] <Lynnwood> function loadTable(target) {
[07:15:57] <Lynnwood> But I can't seem to use the "target" variable consistently. I can do something like this "var targetName = target.attr('id');" and it works to give me the id of the target.
[07:17:17] <Lynnwood> But if I try to use something like "var targChildren = target.children().length;" the variable comes back as 0.
[07:17:30] <Lynnwood> Even though i know the target does have children.
[07:18:05] <Lynnwood> I can enter the id of the target in that same line and it works correctly.
[07:18:39] <Lynnwood> I figure i must be missing something very basic about how jquery interprets the target reference...
[07:19:13] <BillCriswell> Lynnwood: How are you using loadTable()? is it in like a click callback?
[07:19:56] <Lynnwood> it's passed from a function.
[07:20:15] <Lynnwood> used later.
[07:20:16] <Lynnwood> $('.questionTable').each(function() {
[07:20:16] <Lynnwood>        if($(this).attr('id')!='New') { loadTable($(this)); }
[07:20:16] <Lynnwood>      });
[07:22:04] <BillCriswell> Lynnwood:Hmmm... Can you set up a fiddle?
[07:22:15] <Lynnwood> sure.
[07:22:17] <Lynnwood> just a sec
[07:23:28] <doge_wow2> Does jQueryMobile have access to phone specific functions? Like the call log, phone directory etc.
[07:24:17] <BillCriswell> doge_wow2: I sure hope not.
[07:25:30] <doge_wow2> BillCriswell: why not? I would like to retrieve data from the phone's call log with jQuery Mobile.
[07:25:47] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I don't think it's possible.
[07:26:24] <doge_wow2> BillCriswell: aww... :( too bad. Do you know a framework which does have access to phone
[07:26:40] <doge_wow2> BillCriswell: aww... :( too bad. Do you know a framework which does have access to phone's call log, local storage etc?
[07:27:05] <BillCriswell> Like js localStorage?
[07:27:48] <Lynnwood> Actually... BillCriswell - I just stumbled across the issue.
[07:27:59] <doge_wow2> BillCriswell: like storing text files, pictures etc.
[07:28:15] <BillCriswell> Lynnwood: Setting up a fiddle usually solves my problems as well.
[07:28:25] <Lynnwood> I'm loading a section via ajax and when the page first loads, the target div has no children... duh
[07:28:37] <BillCriswell> doge_wow2: You can use localStorange in mobile safari and stuff.
[07:28:54] <BillCriswell> doge_wow2: It looks like it may be possible with PhoneGap to get contacts. That's taking things out of the browser, though.
[07:29:06] <BillCriswell> If I understand phone gap right.
[07:29:23] <Lynnwood> while i was setting up fiddle, the div reloaded and returned the correct number of children...
[07:29:43] <Lynnwood> Thanks so much for offereing the help though!
[07:29:51] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:30:09] <doge_wow2> BillCriswell: yeah, I want to take things out of the browser, use the phone's compass too etc.
[07:30:36] <BillCriswell> doge_wow2: Might have to look into PhoneGap to get access to some of that stuff? Kind of stinks.
[07:30:51] <doge_wow2> BillCriswell: hmm... oki, thnx
[07:31:22] <Vivekananda> Can someone help me on the code ? dont know jquery very well and trying to learn by doing. here is something I am trying to achieve using examples but not sure how to proceed to troubleshoot https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8733113
[07:32:43] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: What are you expecting $(this).prev().val() to be?
[07:32:52] <BillCriswell> Is that referencing an input?
[07:33:43] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Also, using $(this) in the callback of an ajax request probably isn't what you want to this since "this" isn't .auto_complete_cve.
[07:34:21] <BillCriswell> You would need to do like var $this = $(this); above search_field_id then you can use $this inside the ajax callback.
[07:36:07] <BillCriswell> Well, the $.get callback.
[07:39:28] <dAnjou> hey, i don't know how to google this so i'll try to explain my problem here: i included jquery in my page and then via ajax i load some prerendered snippet from the server. this snippets includes a jquery reference ($). now for this reference it says it's undefined.
[07:40:10] <dAnjou> why is that?
[07:40:43] <BinaryKitten> because the page loaded doesn't have jQuery?
[07:40:54] <BinaryKitten> how are you doing the ajax call?
[07:42:53] <dAnjou> oh wait it's more complex
[07:43:05] <dAnjou> let's see if i can set up a sample case
[07:43:30] <aitiba> hi
[07:44:17] <skullcrasher> how do i implement an confirmation box? for now i have given the anchor a class, and set a handler for the lick
[07:44:28] <skullcrasher> and prevent default
[07:44:37] <skullcrasher> *click
[07:44:43] <BillCriswell> skullcrasher: A standard JS confirmation box?
[07:44:46] <skullcrasher> no
[07:44:54] <skullcrasher> this would be .confirm()
[07:45:02] <skullcrasher> this looks too ugly :)
[07:45:41] <skullcrasher> i use a bootstrap modal and have a onclick listener on the confirmation button
[07:46:01] <Anticom> Hi all
[07:46:08] <Anticom> i want to build some sort of shopping component
[07:46:14] <Anticom> Here's what I've styled so far: http://jsbin.com/AXafEmeL/6/
[07:46:28] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/F3Nvs/
[07:46:39] <rethus> why the calculation of float not working?
[07:46:50] <Anticom> the requirements are: source should be draggable & sortable. Destination should be draggable, sortable and droppable (but only to trash, not back to destination)
[07:46:52] <skullcrasher> BillCriswell: so, how can I "restore the default behaviour" for the link
[07:46:59] <rethus> it only concat instead of calculate the new sum
[07:47:14] <Anticom> when an item from source is dropped on destination, the item's checkbox should be checked
[07:47:19] <Anticom> can anyone help me with this?
[07:48:07] <Anticom> (oh and on source -> destination dnd the item should be cloned. there are multiple items of the same type allowed in destination)
[07:50:11] <dAnjou> so, again my question by reference to this gist https://gist.github.com/dAnjou/1cdfbfb47ef6fab29e21 -> in 1.html there is a form which gets submitted and the result, 2.html, will go to the iframe. from there i get it and put it inplace on the original page.
[07:50:32] <dAnjou> but that doesn't seem to work as expected
[07:50:53] <dAnjou> the whole thing is an async file upload
[07:51:02] <dAnjou> apparently that's how you do it
[07:51:17] <dAnjou> (i have to support older browsers!)
[07:51:27] <aitiba> I'm trying to localize http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html#l10nPkgs with those lines http://pastebin.com/qt5tUfGX but I get "TypeError: $.countdown is undefined" on "$.countdown.regionalOptions['es'] = {" that is the spanish translation. øWhat I'm doing wrong??
[07:52:01] <rethus> mhh, now it works. Strange.
[07:52:10] <rethus> maybe an cache-Problem
[07:52:48] <BillCriswell> skullcrasher: Using a bootstrap modal I think would mean you need to e.preventDefault() then depending on the action they take trigger a click on the link.
[07:53:05] <BillCriswell> As opposed to: return confirm('Are you sure you meant to click this?')
[07:53:47] <skullcrasher> yes, that is what i try to do
[07:53:53] <skullcrasher> i have a e.preventDefault()
[07:54:13] <skullcrasher> but how do i trigger the link?
[07:57:54] <BillCriswell> You can use .trigger('click'), but then you find yourself in a loop. You might want to look into this: http://bootboxjs.com/, specifically http://bootboxjs.com/#gist4340217
[07:59:06] <skullcrasher> just found a way it seems
[07:59:25] <skullcrasher> on the confirmation click, i use window.location = link.attr('href')
[08:00:08] <skullcrasher> just don't know if this would be a "proper" solution
[08:01:44] <BillCriswell> skullcrasher: That can work.
[08:05:05] <Anticom> http://jsbin.com/AXafEmeL/8/ anyone able to help me again?
[08:06:19] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: thanks. so if I go ahed with $(.autocomplete).append (key) ; should that work
[08:09:22] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Give it a shot
[08:10:59] <Anticom> There's one thing I've been hating about jq from the beginning of time and space... dnd. I just don't get my mind wrapped arround it
[08:13:32] <Anticom> http://jsbin.com/AXafEmeL/10/edit No one able to help me with my problem?
[08:16:45] <agentbob> hey all.. i'm having deffickulteees with getting jquery to match all the iframes i have on a page... i'm tring $("iframe").heigh=100; and it's only changing the first iframe... anyone got a minute to help a newbie?
[08:17:49] <Anticom> $('iframe').css('height', 100);
[08:17:59] <Anticom> or .attr('height', 100);
[08:18:04] <Anticom> should work too
[08:18:16] <Anticom> .height=100 is getting the first element from your jquery collection
[08:18:35] <Anticom> you should use the fluent interface to manipulate the elements
[08:19:06] <agentbob> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLIFrameElement> has no method 'css'
[08:19:53] <BillCriswell> agentbob: You sure you're using jquery?
[08:20:38] <Anticom> I'm so frustrated ._.
[08:20:43] <Anticom> dnd hates me :D
[08:20:57] <agentbob> BillCriswell: BillCriswell would $("iframe") work otherwise?
[08:21:06] <agentbob> -BillCriswell:
[08:21:20] <Anticom> agentbob (17:17:59)<Anticom>$('iframe').css('height', 100);
[08:21:23] <BillCriswell> If you have something else loaded that's taking over $ sure.
[08:21:58] <Linkandzelda> i have this small script and im trying to get it to work, it does nothing http://pastebin.com/5ZUBxAMX whats wrong?
[08:23:02] <BillCriswell> agentbob: http://jsbin.com/uROGawEX/1/edit?html,js,output simple demo.
[08:23:37] <agentbob> no other scripts loaded.. i'm loading jquery via script.src = "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.min.js";
[08:26:49] <BillCriswell> agentbob: Are ou sure jQuery is ready before you try to use it?
[08:26:52] <decx> TIL i can use $(element).css('rule',function(){ } )
[08:27:30] <BillCriswell> decx: It's very nice.
[08:28:14] <BillCriswell> decx: You can do it with attr() as well.
[08:28:14] <agentbob> hmmm.. testing few things... trying to load jquery from chrome console and think that may be causing probs/i'm probably missing something there
[08:28:16] <decx> i can replace a load of ifs with several .css() inside them with one .css() with the ifs inside it, awesome
[08:28:34] <decx> i actually used it with attr already but never made the mental leap
[08:28:35] <decx> ;)
[08:28:39] <BillCriswell> Haha nice.
[08:28:52] <BillCriswell> May also work for data(). Not positive though.
[08:29:00] <BillCriswell> Too lazy to look it up.
[08:31:14] <ss_haze> do vimeo work for you guys?
[08:31:33] <BillCriswell> vimeo.com loads, yes.
[08:35:41] <Linkandzelda> $('#mkl').css('max-height','650');
[08:35:48] <Linkandzelda> whats wrong with this, anyone?
[08:37:14] <snover> 650px
[08:38:28] <Linkandzelda> snover: no effect
[08:41:14] <Linkandzelda> i swear the whole concept behind jquery is flawed :(
[08:41:38] <decx> fiddle your problem
[08:41:53] <decx> 9/10 the problems is between monitor and chair
[08:42:38] <Linkandzelda> heres a snippet of my source and the js http://jsfiddle.net/5ezRu/4/
[08:43:09] <decx> problem 1, market_list is invalid
[08:43:20] <decx> if you want to target a class it's $('.market_list')
[08:43:39] <Linkandzelda> yea, i tried . and #
[08:43:41] <decx> if you want to target and id it's $('#market_list')
[08:43:43] <Linkandzelda> nothing
[08:44:08] <decx> <div id="markets_list" class="markets_list" style="max-height: 150px;">
[08:44:11] <decx> works just fine
[08:44:30] <decx> fyi, max-height does nothing if you dont overflow: hidden the element
[08:45:15] <decx> Linkandzelda http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5ezRu/8/
[08:46:06] <Linkandzelda> decx: yea, except thats not possible for what i need
[08:46:21] <Linkandzelda> i need to apply that dynamically based on different pages
[08:46:39] <Linkandzelda> then eventually make it be a certain % of the screen height
[08:46:42] <decx> well your problem is with css and not jquery, becuase it sets the max height just fine
[08:47:16] <Linkandzelda> hmm, i think i know the issue
[08:47:22] <Linkandzelda> it doesnt set it if the css isnt already there
[08:48:06] <Linkandzelda> but it is in my other code via external css
[08:49:10] <decx> inline css always takes priority unless you set !important for that rule in your css file
[08:51:52] <Linkandzelda> i have the exact same in my code as the fiddle, doesnt work
[08:52:01] <jedimind> no you dont
[08:52:41] <Linkandzelda> i do jedimind, i do
[08:52:42] <sedeki> how do I make a form ajax friendly? onClick: return false; or something like that right?
[08:52:51] <sedeki> ajax friendly = don't reload
[08:53:20] <Linkandzelda> lol knew it
[08:53:36] <Linkandzelda> http://jsfiddle.net/5ezRu/10/ doesnt work, without overflow hidden
[08:54:08] <decx> that's intended behaviour
[08:55:07] <decx> even though it has max-height, there's nothing stopping the contents from overflowing
[08:55:34] <decx> if you inspect the markets_list element you'll see that its bounding box has teh right height
[08:55:46] <jedimind> Linkandzelda duh?
[08:55:59] <sedeki> how do I post a particular form?
[08:56:04] <sedeki> with ajax
[08:56:14] <jedimind> do it on submit of that form
[08:56:17] <jedimind> or any form
[08:56:32] <Linkandzelda> lol guys, it only works on my site if added as a <script> at the bottom of the page
[08:56:36] <Linkandzelda> otherwise it doesnt owrk
[08:56:45] <jedimind> $('form').submit( function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... })
[08:56:47] <jedimind> Linkandzelda ...
[08:57:20] <decx> ... indeed
[08:58:16] <Linkandzelda> still, i dont get why
[08:58:20] <Linkandzelda> can you guys explain?
[08:59:02] <jedimind> thats how javascript works
[08:59:16] <jedimind> might do yourself a service and read up on some basic javascript stuff Linkandzelda
[08:59:25] <jedimind> take some courses / tutorials online
[08:59:30] <jedimind> teamtreehouse.com or codecademy
[08:59:48] <decx> even http://try.jquery.com
[09:00:04] <jedimind> ^
[09:00:14] <decx> beautiful site
[09:00:36] <fabioportieri> Linkandzelda: with that code you are saying you dont want to submit the form, because you will do an ajax request instead
[09:01:10] <Linkandzelda> fabioportieri: not meant for me?
[09:01:23] <fabioportieri> eh_
[09:01:25] <fabioportieri> ?
[09:01:47] <decx> fabioportieri it was sedeki with the form question ;)
[09:01:56] <Linkandzelda> and ive been including js in my <head> for like 6 years no problems, except with some bits of jquery
[09:02:14] <fabioportieri> ah sorry
[09:06:26] <duch_kazatel> good morning and happy friday, #jquery
[09:06:55] <decx> hey duch, i used an each today, felt that sting in the backside of your head?
[09:07:50] <petey> for something like this, why does it not return an unlimited amount of photos tagged with orange?
[09:07:50] <petey> http://jsbin.com/UxoNItI/1/edit
[09:07:54] <petey> where is the limit coming from?
[09:08:25] <fabioportieri> happy weekend
[09:08:49] <petey> if i is equal to the amount of photos, then stop loading there, but even so, if i remove that it looks like a random # of photos loads. why?
[09:10:57] <cohitre> petey: you'd have to ask flickr why that's the case
[09:11:12] <petey> Oh okay, so that's up to them to limit a limitless request?
[09:11:13] <cohitre> the docs for /services/feeds/photos_public are not specific about how many results they return
[09:11:52] <duch_kazatel> decx that‚Äôs what that headache was this morning...
[09:12:01] <cohitre> but if you want to limit how many items you display i'd recommend using data.items.slice() instead of comparing the index
[09:13:08] <petey> okay cool thanks cohitre
[09:16:58] <petey> cohitre would i replace .each entirely then?
[09:18:06] <cohitre> nah, pass data.items.slice(0, 10) to the each method
[09:18:56] <cohitre> data.items is an array.. data.items.slice(0, 10) is a shorter array
[09:20:45] <petey> ah makes sense, thanks
[09:22:10] <sedeki> how can I get the action attribute of a form element?
[09:22:30] <duch_kazatel> $(‚Äòform‚Äô).attr(‚Äòaction‚Äô);
[09:26:10] <jedimind> i love it when the answer to a question is the same as the question with a couple of extra brackets
[09:27:42] <duch_kazatel> that‚Äôs jquery.
[09:27:58] <duch_kazatel> it‚Äôs a guilty pleasure of mine with it.
[09:28:26] <Linkandzelda> cant find anything as to why my external jquery is not working, and yet it works fine on the page it should be working
[09:28:31] <jeffshaver> can anyone explain how jQuery objects imitate arrays? I read one question on SO about it, but it doesn't really answer my question. I can get an object to look like an array in the console, but unlike jQuery, my object ends up having all the functions on its prototype listed as well
[09:28:48] <decx> that would have been a beautiful ending to an early 80s sitcom, "that's jquery" and the whole channel jumps up and freezeframes into the credits
[09:28:48] <Linkandzelda> jedimind: "how it works" ? please explain more, if possible
[09:29:23] <duch_kazatel> jeffshaver it‚Äôs an array-like object.
[09:29:39] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: i realize that. and i can nearly imitate it
[09:30:03] <cohitre> jeffshaver: you can call .get() to get a javascript array
[09:30:04] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: however, when you do console.log($('div')) it just logs what looks like an array with only the dom elements inside
[09:30:24] <duch_kazatel> iirc, that prints out just that object, not all the properties/methods it inheriuts.
[09:30:26] <duch_kazatel> *inherits
[09:30:53] <cohitre> why are you wanting to use the jquery object as an array? usually when people do that there's something else that they are missing
[09:31:36] <jeffshaver> cohitre: I don't want to use jQuery at all. I am curious as to how they avoid listing out all the prototype methods fro jQuery inside of the console statement
[09:32:14] <jeffshaver> i.e. i am writing some code that could do something similar, but it instead prints out [div#id, prototypefn1, prototypefn2]
[09:32:42] <jeffshaver> i don't want the console statement to list the prototype methods
[09:34:04] <duch_kazatel> oh are you the guy making that simplified selector/event binding lib?
[09:34:15] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: lol. indeed
[09:34:47] <duch_kazatel> mind linking ot the repo?
[09:34:48] <ilhami> Hey
[09:35:05] <ilhami> anybody here?
[09:35:14] <duch_kazatel> i am.
[09:35:24] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: I can link to the repo, but at the moment everything is based on the prototype. I am trying to get it to do the whole array-like object thing lol
[09:35:26] <ilhami> I need to use JQuery on my website
[09:35:42] <ilhami> I want something like this... 2 sec
[09:35:51] <duch_kazatel> jeffshaver i‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs a difference in how you‚Äôre constructing the object.
[09:35:59] <duch_kazatel> i haven‚Äôt dumped into jquery in a while.
[09:36:05] <ilhami> http://haber1903.com/ --- do you see their news slider?
[09:36:24] <ilhami> I want something like this but without numbers... I want dots instead or something else.
[09:36:46] <duch_kazatel> where‚Äôs the ‚Äúnews slider‚Äù?
[09:36:49] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: i have the code in a codepen. i basically went into jQuerys source and started looking at how they were constructing it. kind of close but not quite there: http://codepen.io/jeffshaver/pen/qeIGg
[09:36:58] <ilhami> duch_kazatel on the front page?
[09:37:05] <ilhami> you don't see the 10 news?
[09:37:19] <decx> ilhami there are about 5 million slider scripts that you can use for something like that
[09:37:28] <duch_kazatel> aaaah the carousel .
[09:37:28] <ilhami> :O
[09:37:35] <duch_kazatel> i see it.
[09:37:42] <BillCriswell> Literally 5,000,000 at last count.
[09:37:51] <ilhami> where to find them?
[09:38:00] <ilhami> and how to use them?
[09:38:02] <decx> now that you've wrote that line there are 5,000,005
[09:38:03] <duch_kazatel> ilhami search google.
[09:38:11] <ilhami> hahaha
[09:38:14] <duch_kazatel> there are tons of carousels out there.
[09:38:14] <jedimind> decx its true, i wrote 3.5 of those
[09:38:17] <duch_kazatel> bxslider is one.
[09:38:24] <ilhami> let me tru
[09:38:26] <ilhami> try*
[09:38:43] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: if you could take a look and anything sticks out to you, i would appreciate it
[09:39:05] <sedeki> why does jquery return a ajax fail() when it is a 200 request
[09:39:06] <duch_kazatel> jeffshaver i just see the object.
[09:39:16] <ilhami> duch_kazatel this one's width is too large.
[09:39:25] <duch_kazatel> ilhami you‚Äôd have to customize it.
[09:39:28] <systemfault> sedeki: Perhaps the JSON is invalid
[09:39:35] <systemfault> (Just a guess)
[09:39:37] <sedeki> systemfault ah!
[09:39:38] <ilhami> but duch_kazatel that's actually what I want.
[09:39:57] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: in the console you see just the element in an array?
[09:40:01] <jeffshaver> not th eprototype methods?
[09:40:05] <duch_kazatel> jeffmjack_ yup
[09:40:07] <duch_kazatel> err, jeffshaver
[09:40:20] <duch_kazatel> ilhami you have to do some things yourself.
[09:40:34] <ilhami> yes I know. there is a guide on their site..
[09:40:37] <ilhami> I will look at it
[09:40:42] <duch_kazatel> ilhami you‚Äôll take the basic code and style it/configure it to what you need.
[09:40:55] <ilhami> thanks a lot noob:)
[09:41:03] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:41:04] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: weird. this is what I see: [a#test.test, version: "brief", splice: function, push: function, sort: function, init: function‚Ä¶]
[09:41:13] <duch_kazatel> jeffshaver what browser are you in?
[09:41:18] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: chrome
[09:41:19] <ilhami> duch_kazatel I am the noob :D
[09:42:15] <duch_kazatel> jeffshaver interesting.  firebug just shows the object.
[09:42:29] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: yeah just realized that. i need to figure out how to get rid of that lol
[09:42:36] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[09:42:58] <jeffshaver> i have looked all through jQuerys source and I can't find anythign that sticks out to me
[09:44:08] <duch_kazatel> let me poke at something.
[09:44:24] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That's not the right way to ask.
[09:44:39] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: would definitely appreciate it
[09:44:43] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell ?
[09:45:07] <ilhami> http://jquery.com/download/
[09:45:17] <ilhami> which version of jquery should I get? :D
[09:45:19] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Nevermind.
[09:45:19] <ilhami> thats a dilemma
[09:45:22] <duch_kazatel> ilhami which browsers tdo you need to support?
[09:45:23] <petey> Can I use something like this with .getJSON() ? http://json-generator.appspot.com/j/bLhjtqEBTS
[09:45:29] <petey> It doesn't have .json but it still outputs json
[09:45:32] <ilhami> duch_kazatel just the newer ones..
[09:45:35] <ilhami> so 2.x?
[09:45:38] <duch_kazatel> ilhami yes.
[09:45:49] <duch_kazatel> jeffshaver console logging the jquery object does show all those methods...
[09:46:09] <ilhami> duch_kazatel production, development, map file? which one?
[09:46:25] <jeffshaver> what?! i could have swore...
[09:46:32] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: sigh
[09:46:32] <duch_kazatel> ilhami i don‚Äôt have time to hold your hand.  go look for a guiude.
[09:46:50] <ilhami> answer you noob :D
[09:47:20] <duch_kazatel> ilhami I‚Äôm at work right now and do not have the time nor the inclination to hold your hand through this process.
[09:47:30] <duch_kazatel> your insult sealed the deal.
[09:47:37] <ilhami> I don't want you to hold my hand. :D
[09:47:41] <ilhami> I am not gay
[09:47:42] <ilhami> :D
[09:47:51] <petey> can anyone let me know why this doesn't work? http://jsbin.com/EbAyojel/1/edit
[09:47:55] <duch_kazatel> ilhami you‚Äôre asking extremely basic questions like ‚Äúwhich version of jquery should I download?‚Äù
[09:48:03] <duch_kazatel> ilhami go to google - start there.
[09:48:20] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: i am losing my mind. thanks for the sanity check
[09:48:22] <duch_kazatel> jeffshaver - http://jsfiddle.net/Ceu25/ in chrome, this does it.
[09:48:45] <duch_kazatel> jeffshaver i‚Äôll bet you ran something directly in the console and started getting mixed up.  i do that kind of stuff all the time.
[09:49:41] <ilhami> duch_kazatel but you hold their hands
[09:49:55] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: omg... yes
[09:50:01] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: thats what i did!!!
[09:50:20] <ilhami> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js
[09:50:32] <duch_kazatel> ilhami the‚Äôre asking specific questions that are quickly and easily answered.  your questions are very basic.  go here: http://learn.jquery.com/
[09:50:32] <ilhami> LOL
[09:50:52] <ilhami> dude should I make a file and copy the content from that file or what?
[09:51:02] <ilhami> and save it there?
[09:51:09] <duch_kazatel> ilhami the link i sent you answers all your questions.
[09:51:23] <juanchito> hello to everyone :) its possibly search by name='field' whithout know the type of that input? example $(''name=¬¥myfield¬¥")
[09:51:32] <snover> duch_kazatel: come on bro, don‚Äôt make him think
[09:51:52] <duch_kazatel> snover seriously.
[09:51:53] <jeffshaver> duch_kazatel: btw, the github repo link is: https://github.com/jeffshaver/brief.js i will probably push this new code up later tonight when i get the change to update the readme
[09:52:12] <duch_kazatel> juanchito yup - $(‚Äò[name=‚Äùfield‚Äù]‚Äô);
[09:52:31] <duch_kazatel> or rather $(‚Äò[name=‚Äùmyfield‚Äù]‚Äô);, per your example
[09:52:32] <juanchito> thanks duch!!
[09:52:34] <juanchito> :)
[09:52:41] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[09:52:45] <systemfault> juanchito: Only do that if you don't have the choice
[09:52:53] <ilhami> that site is very bad duch_kazatel
[09:53:00] <duch_kazatel> ilhami that site is great.
[09:53:06] <ilhami> naah
[09:53:07] <systemfault> name attributes hould be off-limit for frontend.
[09:53:17] <systemfault> At least Styling
[09:53:19] <duch_kazatel> juanchito that selector is very slow, so only do it if you have no other choice.
[09:53:26] <juanchito> i dont have a choice because the server sendme errors [field1: msg, field2, msg2]
[09:53:30] <systemfault> Who cares if it's slow..
[09:53:40] <snover> people that like performance
[09:53:43] <juanchito> dont send me the type
[09:53:47] <juanchito> :(
[09:54:00] <jeffshaver> petey: you can't do that cross domain
[09:54:03] <systemfault> The problem is that "name" attributes are bound to the backend and might change.
[09:54:09] <jeffshaver> petey: couldn't tell if anyone had responded yet
[09:54:24] <petey> jeffshaver, no one did, thanks why not? what's the correct way?
[09:54:27] <petey> would I use .ajax instead?
[09:54:30] <ilhami> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5932058/difference-between-jquery-production-and-jquery-development duch_kazatel
[09:54:30] <juanchito> but i generate the form in the backend
[09:54:35] <petey> this one works fine cross domain http://jsbin.com/UxoNItI/1/edit
[09:54:38] <ilhami> stackoverflow is the best site duch_kazatel
[09:54:57] <duch_kazatel> ilhami please read learn.jquery.com.  please stop bothering me until you have actually made some effort.
[09:55:06] <decx> ilhami go here http://try.jquery.com and play the game, this should give you all the knowledge to include jquery and a plugin on a page.
[09:55:18] <ilhami> decx nice. :D
[09:55:18] <jeffshaver> petey: the latter is jsonp which is allowed to go cross domain
[09:55:18] <duch_kazatel> ^^ do that.
[09:55:30] <ilhami> see duch_kazatel ? do you ever give advices like decx? :D
[09:55:44] <petey> is there a way to convert json into jsonp? Otherwise any json I want to use should always be on the same domain right?
[09:55:51] <decx> you're not helping yourself with that attitude broski
[09:56:04] <duch_kazatel> ilhami i was telling you to learn to use jquery.
[09:56:08] <duch_kazatel> become self sufficient.
[09:56:22] <duch_kazatel> insulting anybody won‚Äôt get you very far in here.
[09:56:24] <ilhami> decx is really helpful and give good advices :)
[09:56:29] <systemfault> petey: Yes, unless you don't need to support old browsers, then you can use CORS
[09:56:46] <BinaryKitten> ilhami - yes duch_kazatel actually helps with spot on advice
[09:56:59] <decx> duch_kazatel well that settles it, i am the actual guru here. i command you to use .each in an interval
[09:57:00] <BinaryKitten> ilhami - usually extremely succinct advice no-less
[09:57:03] <decx> ;)
[09:57:12] <petey> systemfault, is there anyway I can generate a dummy JSONP to test this out?
[09:57:19] <petey> or anywhere I mean, anywhere online
[09:57:23] <jeffshaver> petey: json that you need will always have to come from the same domain. However, you could, "COULD", have some backend script that goes and gets JSON from another domain and returns it. So you call your your, it grabs info from another domain and then your server will return it to you
[09:57:25] <petey> something I can link that to
[09:57:35] <daslicht> hi :)
[09:57:42] <decx> hi daslicht
[09:57:46] <petey> that makes sense jeffshaver, is there a way you can tell between json and jsonp? is it in the formatting?
[09:57:49] <duch_kazatel> hah, thanks BinaryKitten
[09:57:52] <ilhami> <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
[09:57:54] <duch_kazatel> appreciate it.
[09:57:58] <systemfault> petey: I don't know... JSONP is an ugly hack
[09:58:01] <ilhami> it's not that hard tbh.
[09:58:09] <ilhami> duch_kazatel makes it sound a bit harder than it is
[09:58:20] <duch_kazatel> ilhami not at all - i‚Äôm encouraging you to learn for yourself.
[09:58:24] <duch_kazatel> become self-sufficient.
[09:58:24] <BinaryKitten> dev you mean setInterval(function() { $('#decx').each(function(){$(this).remove().ban(); }); }), 1000) ?
[09:58:24] <petey> systemfault, is CORS the recommended method or is using JSON on a local domain the correct way to do it?
[09:58:46] <petey> systemfault, I just want to learn how to do this stuff correctly which is why I'm wondering about linking the file, I don't have any dummy data to work with
[09:59:05] <sedeki> how do I change an attribute of a html element?
[09:59:16] <systemfault> petey: It depends... there's no "single" answer
[09:59:19] <BinaryKitten> .attr sedeki
[09:59:21] <duch_kazatel> sedeki $(‚Äòselector‚Äô).attr(‚Äòname‚Äô, ‚Äòvalue‚Äô);
[09:59:25] <decx> lol BinaryKitten
[09:59:25] <sedeki> for instance, obj.attr('style') = 'test';
[09:59:29] <sedeki> ah ok
[09:59:56] <petey> systemfault do you have anything I can read up on? I basically want a JSON file full of some arbitrary data, then loading it depending on what I call
[10:00:14] <petey> A neighborhood of people for example, each person lives in a different house, you click on that house and the data from JSON loads their info
[10:00:23] <ilhami> I prefer stackoverflow :)
[10:00:27] <petey> the JSON file can be local, but for the sake of testing I just put it up on jsbin
[10:00:53] <systemfault> petey: Then install a small webserver and test using it :)
[10:00:54] <duch_kazatel> stackoverflow can be nice to get some quick answers to questions, but I find that people do a lot of copy/paste from there without understanding what that code does.
[10:01:11] <daslicht> petey: what kind of serverside tech you use to generate the json ?
[10:01:34] <petey> dashlict, I don't have any serverside tech, this would jstu be a static json file
[10:01:38] <petey> systemfault, good idea!
[10:01:53] <petey> daslicht, but I figure for the added benefit I may install something like mongodb and pull the data from there
[10:02:04] <daslicht> so you want to get eacht time the full json and filter on teh client  ?
[10:02:15] <ilhami> duch_kazatel I was just using it to get quick answers as you wrote.
[10:02:22] <ilhami> I didn't really copy code from there.
[10:02:29] <ilhami> yet...
[10:03:02] <ilhami> duch_kazatel I may have copied code from there before... but not now I mean.
[10:04:04] <daslicht> petey: you are sure MongoDB has a web interface ?
[10:04:06] <daslicht> i douibt
[10:04:13] <daslicht> couchdb has tho
[10:05:18] <duch_kazatel> jesus christ IE11‚Äôs caching is nutty
[10:05:29] <daslicht> heh
[10:05:34] <daslicht> dont use it
[10:05:36] <duch_kazatel> it‚Äôs way aggressive.
[10:05:42] <duch_kazatel> i have to support it.
[10:05:46] <daslicht> ouch
[10:05:48] <duch_kazatel> IE 8, 9, 10, and 11.
[10:05:54] <daslicht> show browserhappy message hehe
[10:05:56] <duch_kazatel> we make good money off of the people using them, soooo...
[10:06:12] <systemfault> Ie9+ are fine.
[10:06:13] <daslicht> yeah
[10:06:19] <daslicht> mmm
[10:06:27] <duch_kazatel> it‚Äôs really not that bad
[10:06:30] <daslicht> but not anything is qworking in ie9 :)
[10:06:58] <duch_kazatel> actually i had a harder time getting pushstates working correctly in chrome than my shim for old IE.
[10:06:59] <daslicht> eg: http://caniuse.com/#search=transition
[10:07:15] <daslicht> but luckily >9 does
[10:07:42] <duch_kazatel> yup
[10:07:55] <daslicht> never had issues in chome
[10:08:07] <duch_kazatel> chrome doesn‚Äôt match the spec for pushstates.
[10:08:16] <daslicht> http://marcwensauer.de/
[10:08:19] <daslicht> pushstate :)
[10:08:21] <duch_kazatel> it fires a popstate event on pageload, which is wrong.
[10:08:28] <daslicht> ouch
[10:08:43] <duch_kazatel> not a big deal, just took forever to figure out.  the bug‚Äôs been outstanding for years now.
[10:09:04] <daslicht> heh, the joy of modern computing heh
[10:09:18] <duch_kazatel> right?  it‚Äôs really not that bad.  i rarely have cross-browser issues these days.
[10:09:42] <Vivekananda> still stuck at the same problem and trying to figure it out
[10:09:54] <duch_kazatel> what is it, Vivekananda?
[10:10:36] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:10:45] <iandees> is there a way to get the body of the response in $.getJSON()'s error handlers?
[10:11:16] <iandees> the API is returning an HTTP 400 on error and also includes a JSON body that describes the error condition. i can't seem to get to that
[10:12:48] <robert0> all right back.
[10:14:13] <Vivekananda> I have a working code for a working input and it works now I am trying to modify it so it works for a new input and using an example code. The working input is a plain text array ( box 1 ) and working input was box (2 ) https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8702800 . Now new input is in form of JSON  box (3) and new code is this ---  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8733113 . The example I want to emulate is this one --  http://j
[10:14:13] <Vivekananda> queryui.com/autocomplete/#categories . My questions are 1. why does "this" work in the working code  ( line 4 box 2) . 2. What does "response" do and why is it there ? ( line7 box 2) working code.  3. why does this.append Not work in NEw code
[10:17:51] <duch_kazatel> aaand one more restart.
[10:21:27] <duch_kazatel> new work laptop is a BEAST>
[10:21:58] <Es0teric> how do i pass the value of a variable outside of a click event? because return var; isnt workin
[10:22:09] <Es0teric> i've always had a scope issue with js
[10:22:10] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric have a fiddle?
[10:22:38] <systemfault> Es0teric: Yeah... async can be a pain. Short answer: Impossible
[10:23:03] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel no, but theoretically‚Ä¶ how would that be achieved -- i am passing a variable outside of a click event into a click event then retrieving the return value outside the click event
[10:23:20] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric declare the var is a higher, shared scope.
[10:23:30] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel how would i do that?
[10:23:43] <Es0teric> var somevar = "val1"; ?
[10:23:58] <Es0teric> and systemfault  yeah asyc is a pain most of the time =_= lol
[10:25:31] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric http://jsfiddle.net/Kcu2w/
[10:26:09] <Vivekananda> oo nice you are back
[10:26:12] <Vivekananda> really ?
[10:26:16] <Vivekananda> what kind of beast
[10:26:23] <Vivekananda> I know only one laptop that is actually a beast
[10:26:26] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel:
[10:26:43] <Vivekananda> also would be lovely if you could comment on the novice question I posed of jquery
[10:27:04] <duch_kazatel> it's an i7 with 16 gigs of ram and a 250 gig SSD
[10:27:12] <Vivekananda> interesting
[10:27:14] <duch_kazatel> and what was the question?
[10:27:16] <Vivekananda> which i7
[10:27:32] <duch_kazatel> 3740QM
[10:27:38] <Vivekananda> The question is a long one so please bear with me
[10:27:51] <Vivekananda> okay that is a nice one
[10:27:57] <mwcz> does anyone know of a way to find out how many .done handlers have been attached to a deferred obj?
[10:28:12] <Vivekananda> which company ? and did you buy it very costly ? I am looking for a rebated beast myself
[10:28:21] <Vivekananda> as to the question --
[10:28:22] <Vivekananda>  I have a working code for a working input and it works now I am trying to modify it so it works for a new input and using an example code. The working input is a plain text array ( box 1 ) and working input was box (2 ) https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8702800 . Now new input is in form of JSON  box (3) and new code is this ---  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8733113 . The example I want to emulate is this one --  http://j
[10:28:22] <Vivekananda> <Vivekananda> queryui.com/autocomplete/#categories . My questions are 1. why does "this" work in the working code  ( line 4 box 2) . 2. What does "response" do and why is it there ? ( line7 box 2) working code.  3. why does this.append Not work in NEw code
[10:28:32] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda I got it for work - I didn't pay for it.
[10:28:41] <Vivekananda> hmm okay
[10:28:42] <terrycojones> mwcz: do you have the deferred, or only a promise for it?
[10:28:46] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok what if i want to put "yourVar" inside the aFunc() scope and get the value after aFunc() executes?
[10:28:52] <mwcz> terrycojones, I have the deferred
[10:29:17] <Es0teric> so basically pass yourVar inside aFunc() then console.log(yourVar); after aFunc(){}
[10:29:26] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda one sec.  let me wrap up with Es0teric :)
[10:29:33] <Vivekananda> sure
[10:31:08] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric, you can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/Kcu2w/2/
[10:31:42] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda is there any way you could setup a fiddle with that?
[10:31:59] <Vivekananda> :(
[10:32:06] <Vivekananda> I have tried and failed
[10:32:13] <Vivekananda> no way I can send a data input to a fiddle
[10:32:15] <duch_kazatel> sorry, it's hard to follow what you're asking.
[10:32:19] <duch_kazatel> sure you can.
[10:32:38] <Vivekananda> and if i do then the relevant secion of the code will be lost
[10:32:49] <Vivekananda> okay let me try it in bits and pieces
[10:32:57] <Vivekananda> may I ?
[10:33:11] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok but how would that work after a .on('click') ?
[10:33:33] <systemfault> Probably not
[10:33:48] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda ah i see your questions now - $(this) is set to the .auto_complete_cve element.  that's why it works.
[10:34:12] <Vivekananda> good good
[10:34:48] <Vivekananda> where does that setting take place ( I am assuming you are referring to the first gist I pasted ie the working code )
[10:35:02] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda that's the current context.
[10:35:15] <terrycojones_> mwcz: hmmm, i'm not sure that you can get into the deferred to see the callback list.  you could just make a new deferred with a custom .done function on it and a method to get the count. hopefully that makes sense...
[10:35:17] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean.  and for #2 - response is a function defined elsewhere.   it's a callback.
[10:35:18] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel -> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/34/ as you can see it doesnt log the number
[10:35:42] <terrycojones_> mwcz: i can help a bit more later, if you like.  in a meeting now.
[10:35:46] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric are you trying to log the number after it gets clicked?
[10:35:53] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yes
[10:35:57] <Es0teric> well after the arrow is clicked
[10:36:03] <Es0teric> whichever one
[10:36:10] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/35/
[10:36:17] <duch_kazatel> just needed to move where the console log was getting called from.
[10:36:29] <duch_kazatel> you were calling it so it only ran once, instead of within the event handler.
[10:36:35] <mwcz> terrycojones, yeah, good call!  I'll override .done
[10:36:47] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i want the number to be available AFTER the click‚Ä¶ that will only work during the click event
[10:36:58] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric it is available after, as well.
[10:37:32] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel sec, i will test it
[10:38:27] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel nope, its not available outside the scope of the click event which is what i am trying to say‚Ä¶ i want it to be available outside the scope
[10:38:34] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: do you mean that in the first gist I pasted whenever I say this , it will refer to the '.auto_complete_cve'  class of elements. I request you to word your responses explicitly otherwise I might get easily confused
[10:38:36] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric yes it is.  prove it isn't.
[10:38:58] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda $(this) will refer to that element within the event handler.
[10:38:58] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i just did console.log(currentNumber); outside the click scope and its not showing me the number
[10:39:10] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric right becuase that code only gets run once on pageload.
[10:39:16] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric it's not going to run again.
[10:39:59] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: so if that is the case then in my second gist -- https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8733113 . the append should work fine and should show me the elements ( ie keys ) of the collected data. Currently it displays nothing
[10:40:05] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel sec let me test this
[10:40:26] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric poke at this: http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/37/
[10:40:58] <VectorX> hi, anyone know how i can create a map like this, ie some example or tute, http://bit.ly/1ifzLht
[10:41:14] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda try to console.log($(this)); within that get.
[10:41:30] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda are you familiar with the console?
[10:41:36] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok but i am trying to hide arrows depending on which "slide" its on‚Ä¶ right now its listening for a click event THEN it hides an arrow based on which is clicked
[10:42:00] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric huh?  rephrase the question.
[10:43:02] <duch_kazatel> because it sounds like what you want and what its doing are the same thing.
[10:43:38] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok, right now you see two arrows right? there should be one arrow which is the "down" arrow‚Ä¶ the "up" arrow is supposed to be hidden by default but when teh down arrow is clicked, it should be hidden to reveal the up arrow
[10:43:54] <duch_kazatel> easy
[10:44:39] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i know that on the click event i just make the up arrow hidden and the down arrow to show but‚Ä¶ what if the user clicks on the up arrow again and is on the top slide?
[10:44:44] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric why not do it with CSS?  or do you plan on linking to individual sections?
[10:44:55] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: a little
[10:44:59] <Vivekananda> and tyring to learn more
[10:45:08] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda learn the console - it is your friend.
[10:45:10] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel css? you mean by using the :active selector?
[10:45:25] <Vivekananda> will I see the result on the cli or on firebug or on the page itself ?
[10:45:26] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric one sec.  let me show you one solution to this.
[10:45:33] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda within the console...
[10:45:34] <duch_kazatel> firebug.
[10:45:40] <Vivekananda> got it
[10:46:01] <tonythomas01>  I have to add a jquery event to a set of checkboxes with id =foo -0, foo -1 and so on .. is there some code like $(foo-* ) to get it all done
[10:49:57] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric sorry got pulled away - http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/38/
[10:50:16] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I tried putting in the line inside the get fucntion but I dont get any console output . I however did get an error message in cosole
[10:50:22] <duch_kazatel> that's the start, and then in your handlers you'll have to determine the rest of your logic.
[10:50:31] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda what was the error?
[10:50:45] <Vivekananda> invalid in operand e
[10:51:10] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda link to your code again?
[10:51:10] <Vivekananda> on jquery line 3. I am talking about the new code and not the workign one
[10:51:16] <Vivekananda> one sec
[10:51:17] <Vivekananda> https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8733113
[10:51:53] <duch_kazatel> copy/paste the error.
[10:51:54] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel let me check it out real quick
[10:54:01] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: let me change the code to the current one I am running and also the error
[10:56:37] <Vivekananda> https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8733113
[10:58:11] <duch_kazatel> delete the console.log and see if you still get an error.
[10:59:02] <Vivekananda> okay doing now
[10:59:19] <duch_kazatel> in fact, delete the each, as well.
[10:59:53] <Vivekananda> yep still getting it
[11:00:34] <duch_kazatel> then you've got a bigger problem.
[11:00:42] <duch_kazatel> and without a working fiddle, i can't help much ;)
[11:01:03] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: if I run the code on the other gist then I dont get any errors --  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8702800
[11:01:36] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda without a working fiddle i'm flying blind
[11:02:34] <Vivekananda> hmmm
[11:02:37] <Vivekananda> so tell me
[11:02:47] <Vivekananda> can I do a get request in a jfiddle
[11:03:07] <duch_kazatel> sure - you can do one against another fiddle even.  i don't have time to show you at the moment.
[11:05:44] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda wait...
[11:07:33] <duch_kazatel> nvm
[11:07:47] <duch_kazatel> i think you need to simplify what you're trying first and then go from ther.e
[11:07:57] <BillCriswell> She bang, she bang, yeah baby.
[11:08:03] <duch_kazatel> JEUH
[11:08:08] <BillCriswell> she move, she move
[11:08:49] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i figured out exactly what i wanted to happen, thanks man
[11:09:14] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric of course.
[11:09:26] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: hey
[11:09:39] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i just have to get back into the js logic‚Ä¶ i still have a few things to logically get used to
[11:09:40] <Es0teric> lol
[11:09:46] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Ayyyyyyyy
[11:10:02] <Vivekananda> had to leave yesterday after you gave me some insight and duch_kazatel was helpful but I am stuck
[11:10:06] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you'll learn.
[11:10:27] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel you mean re-learn lol
[11:12:23] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: never mind the new code. Could you just tell me somethings about the old working code ? ie this one --  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8702800  box 2
[11:12:33] <duch_kazatel> what do you want to know?
[11:13:04] <Vivekananda> this is not my code but am trying to figure out some lines especially what line 3 and 7 are doing
[11:14:12] <duch_kazatel> line 3 is setting the var search_field_id to $(this).prev().val(); - looks like that's an input.  I'd look up what .prev() does so you understand it.
[11:14:41] <duch_kazatel> line 7 is calling a function called "response" and passing it the data as an array, split on '\n'
[11:18:45] <jenia> hello.
[11:18:51] <Vivekananda> okay so you said that this is referring to the current element class. is that correct ? Also the output of this autocomplete looks like this --- [{"vendors":["Microsoft  (199)","Supermicro  (134)","Trianglemicroworks  (73)","Michael Vogt  (3)","Erik Michaels-ober  (1)","Michael Staatz  (1)"]},{"products":["Micom S1 Studio  (2)","Micom S1 Agile  (1)"]}]     on an input of "mic"  . Now let me try to create a fiddle out of this inp
[11:18:51] <Vivekananda> ut and see if it will work
[11:18:58] <Vivekananda> I will be back in a bit
[11:19:04] <jenia> for some readon i cannot do $("#blabla").tabs()
[11:19:05] <Vivekananda> got to do stuff
[11:19:18] <jenia> i tells me "object has no method tabs"
[11:19:42] <jenia> is there a separate download for the UI components?
[11:24:19] <BillCriswell> I'm all over the place today.
[11:25:11] <duch_kazatel> jenia yes
[11:25:20] <duch_kazatel> jenia you have to download jqueryui separate from jquery
[11:26:01] <jenia> thanks duch_kazatel
[11:29:05] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/zkFcX/ in this paste, i have decleaired an array with an object inside. But i cant access it.
[11:29:08] <jenia> when I did $("#blabla").tabs(). the tabs are not horizontal
[11:29:19] <jenia> they're in a vertical list.
[11:29:29] <jenia> how do i make them horizontal?
[11:29:30] <duch_kazatel> jenia you'll have to configure things.
[11:29:33] <duch_kazatel> read the docs.
[11:29:45] <BillCriswell> jenia: Be sure to include the jquery ui stylesheet.
[11:29:49] <rethus> any idea, why this doesnt work
[11:30:01] <jenia> ahhh okay
[11:30:10] <jenia> thanks BillCriswell
[11:30:15] <rethus> line 80 for starts one of this declarations
[11:30:18] <duch_kazatel> rethus could you fix that fiddle so the javascript is in the script panel iunstead?
[11:30:37] <duch_kazatel> rethus also, don't use new for arrays and objects.
[11:30:42] <duch_kazatel> completely unnecessary.
[11:31:24] <rethus> duch_kazatel - i don't know if this where the same circumstances
[11:31:51] <rethus> cause in original sourcecode i also need to declare this array inside of the body
[11:31:52] <BillCriswell> rethus: Be specific about the line as well, and where you can't access it from.
[11:32:42] <rethus> line 80 this is the declaration. and then i try to put in firebug something like data[1]["pid"]
[11:32:43] <duch_kazatel> rethus http://jsfiddle.net/zkFcX/1/
[11:32:56] <duch_kazatel> rethus do this instead.
[11:33:09] <rethus> duch_kazatel: thanks
[11:33:10] <duch_kazatel> you kept using "new" when a) it's unnecessary, and b) it was emptying your array
[11:33:17] <duch_kazatel> use object and array literals instead.
[11:33:57] <rethus> k, I'll try this
[11:35:03] <rethus> thats works well.
[11:35:12] <duch_kazatel> even better, do this: http://jsfiddle.net/zkFcX/2/
[11:35:48] <duch_kazatel> your syntax before was also redundant - arrays hold objects, so you didn't need to say "put a new object in this spot".  that's what it'd do anyway.
[11:35:57] <rethus> ahh, now i see, cause its "generated Code" it has data = new Array for each declaration-block.
[11:36:08] <duch_kazatel> "generated code"?
[11:36:20] <rethus> out of php in a while-loop
[11:36:22] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't be "generating code".  write code.  generate data.
[11:36:27] <duch_kazatel> don't "generate code"
[11:38:57] <BillCriswell> I am really glad Chrome is going team is going to start focusing on speed and usability again.
[11:39:56] <rethus> BillCriswell: what i doesn't like, that the "console" Toggle Icon is switched to the right corner in the dev-dialoge.
[11:40:15] <rethus> for me it should be still on left side like last version
[11:42:01] <duch_kazatel> lol buttons.
[11:42:31] <rethus> whats the commend for prev. input filed
[11:42:46] <duch_kazatel> for what?
[11:42:56] <duch_kazatel> like, when you tab from input to another?
[11:43:07] <rethus> $(this).prev("input") ?
[11:43:17] <BillCriswell> rethus: I feel like the tools are  like hiding "Emulation" options. Don't get why it doesn't get it's own pane/panel.
[11:43:38] <rethus> the input-field in sourcecode, not tab-sort-order
[11:43:52] <duch_kazatel> rethus try $(this).prevAll('input').val(); ?
[11:44:38] <rethus> BillCriswell: but this emulation-feature is realy great... but also found it before 2 days, cause it is such hidden
[11:45:40] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it's weird it's only available in the "Console Drawer" but not just the "Console".
[11:47:01] <BillCriswell> They're awesome when they're working properly. =)
[11:51:37] <Voyage> the .find and .children().first() are same?
[11:51:45] <duch_kazatel> Voyage nope.
[11:52:10] <duch_kazatel> .find() is a deep search, .chldren() is only one level.
[12:05:15] <guideX> is there anything like a front end jquery pin login ?
[12:05:28] <guideX> where user has pin pad for login system?
[12:05:33] <guideX> that looks neat
[12:05:40] <jedimind> that's not a plugin
[12:05:44] <jedimind> thats just ... something you need to build.
[12:05:49] <guideX> yeah not really more like some css and images
[12:06:05] <guideX> was just looking around to see if there's something like that pre built for jquery
[12:06:19] <guideX> jquery on screen pin pad, etc
[12:06:55] <duch_kazatel> guideX why would that be something for jquery?  why not just a simple template or something?
[12:07:29] <guideX> idk.. a lot of widgets are ready made, like check boxes, select boxes... just thought maybe someone thought of this too already
[12:08:30] <Idealien> Anyone have suggestions / theories on why a basic validation before an ajax call would fail only in IE8?
[12:08:40] <guideX> there is  jQuery Browser PinPAd but I can't find it
[12:08:55] <jedimind> what the
[12:09:01] <guideX> it's #28 on this list... http://rockingcode.com/misc/ajax/have-you-seen-these-30-ajax-plugins-before/
[12:09:05] <jedimind> apparently cmd+k clears this window
[12:09:56] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Sounds very IRC ish.
[12:10:07] <BillCriswell> Control + L clears the Terminal.
[12:11:05] <Idealien> If I run same code via IE dev tools script window it works ok to pass on to step 2 of form.
[12:11:09] <guideX> lookinig on archive.org :>>
[12:18:25] <guideX> hey cool I found a keypad here.. http://keith-wood.name/keypad.html
[12:18:39] <guideX> it's a little ugly, but gives me a nice start.. thanks :)
[12:29:46] <Vivekananda> I am trying to prepare a fiddle
[12:30:20] <Vivekananda> the current one is not working http://jsfiddle.net/aEKu8/3/. I should see a text box for search in there but is not visible. Help
[12:31:40] <duch_kazatel> hahaha why are you using migrate?
[12:31:52] <Vivekananda> I just checked all the boxes
[12:31:56] <BillCriswell> content-box is so stupid.
[12:31:57] <Vivekananda> :(
[12:32:00] <duch_kazatel> do you need all of them?
[12:32:32] <BillCriswell> border-box should have been the default from the beginning of time.
[12:33:01] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I unchecked all and doing only
[12:33:07] <Vivekananda> ui now
[12:33:13] <Vivekananda> still I dont see that search box
[12:33:27] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda you don't have anything defining a search box, do you?
[12:33:39] <duch_kazatel> i see a bunch of buttons.
[12:35:06] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: the jquery should add a text box and autobind it to some fucntion defined there
[12:36:20] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda what jquery?  your plugin?
[12:37:12] <Vivekananda> I mean the code written in the lower box is present in my custom.js file. it basically adds a text search box with autocomplete to the page
[12:47:14] <sedeki> how do I put a delay (aka setTimeout) on an animation?
[12:47:24] <ilhami> hey duch_kazatel
[12:47:26] <ilhami> I am back :D
[12:47:32] <ilhami> Just got home from school
[12:47:40] <duch_kazatel> ilhami hi
[12:47:55] <duch_kazatel> sedeki there's a delay option most of the time.
[12:48:16] <sedeki> duch_kazatel "delay" doesn't do the trick
[12:48:22] <sedeki> it doesn't respond to it
[12:48:44] <sedeki> hmm let's try start
[12:49:47] <ilhami> should I learn Erlang?
[12:57:57] <duch_kazatel> ilhami huh?
[12:58:07] <duch_kazatel> what are your goals?
[12:58:45] <ilhami> to learn all programming languages in the world.
[12:58:53] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[12:58:54] <duch_kazatel> welp.
[12:58:56] <duch_kazatel> good luck buddy
[13:01:06] <jdestef1> do elements lose their .on({click: /*func*/})  binding when they are .remove()'d from the DOM and re-appended?
[13:01:09] <jdestef1> (it appears so)
[13:01:38] <duch_kazatel> yes - removing it destroys the node.
[13:02:09] <jdestef1> are there any alternatives to removing it from the DOM, but not "destroying" it?
[13:02:26] <duch_kazatel> removing it from the DOM destroys it no matter what :)
[13:02:27] <jdestef1> (basically im removing and re-appending a floating listbox in various places)
[13:02:31] <duch_kazatel> use a different version of on
[13:02:42] <duch_kazatel> you should use the delegated version instead.
[13:02:58] <jdestef1> never heard of that technique... delegated version of on?
[13:03:25] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click', 'child', function(){});
[13:03:28] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/6QCcK/7/ <--- How to get this rows equal sized
[13:03:44] <duch_kazatel> bind the event listener to a parent node and listen for events as the bubble up.
[13:03:52] <jdestef1> k thx ill check out that syntax
[13:05:29] <jdestef1> Whiskey:  "rows"?  i only see one row.
[13:06:29] <basiclaser> hey guys i've got this geolocation code here, I would like to convert it so that it calcuates distance between a fixed set of coordinates and the user's position. Wat Do? www.basic-laser.com/geo (i would put it in a jsfiddle, but geolocation doesnt seem to work in it )
[13:06:48] <Whiskey> hehe tds then :)
[13:07:02] <duch_kazatel> basiclaser how are you getting th users' location?
[13:07:34] <Whiskey> jedimind: hehe tds then :)
[13:08:09] <ilhami> duch_kazatel: are you there?
[13:08:15] <duch_kazatel> ilhami yep
[13:08:47] <ilhami> http://bxslider.com/ where should I call that method in step 3? should I make a new .js file?
[13:08:53] <basiclaser> duch_kazatel: position.coords.latitude
[13:08:56] <basiclaser> etc
[13:09:09] <yellowfish> does anyone know a fast search-as-you-type Javascript project?
[13:09:10] <ilhami> $(document).ready... this method
[13:09:46] <duch_kazatel> make a new js file and reference that file in your document.,
[13:09:51] <ilhami> sure.
[13:09:52] <duch_kazatel> right after your jquery one.
[13:10:12] <basiclaser> duch_kazatel: ok :) with an if ? i am supernoob :P
[13:10:42] <duch_kazatel> basiclaser how are you getting the end user's location?  are you asking them?
[13:10:53] <Whiskey> no one have some slotion?
[13:11:04] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey your question doesn't make any sense.
[13:11:21] <basiclaser> duch_kazatel: yeh it asks permission
[13:11:56] <basiclaser> 'this website would like your location' etc
[13:11:57] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: what part don¬¥t you get? its 2 tds them are not equal sized
[13:12:17] <duch_kazatel> basiclaser doesn't seem like that'd be very accurate.
[13:12:22] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey re-link to the fiddle please?
[13:12:30] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/6QCcK/7/
[13:13:23] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  then whats the difference between .children() and .children().first() ?    and what do you mean by deep level?   div-1> div>span> div> span      for div-1 , the first span is .children?
[13:13:33] <basiclaser> duch_kazatel: i thought it was somehow better than geoIP. though im not sure how the info is obtained
[13:14:13] <ilhami> duch_kazatel: thanks dude.. it will work soon I think.. 2 sec
[13:14:18] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey hard set a width in your TD.
[13:14:33] <Whiskey> how can it be?
[13:14:49] <duch_kazatel> whiskey http://jsfiddle.net/6QCcK/8/
[13:15:16] <Whiskey> duch no thats not it :)
[13:15:19] <duch_kazatel> Voyage children() matches all direct descendents of a selector.  the .first() returns the first one it matches.
[13:15:37] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey that was an example.  adjust the width according to your needs.
[13:15:49] <Whiskey> JS has to do it
[13:15:55] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey uh, why?
[13:16:00] <Whiskey> the left side alwasys need to have same size as the left
[13:16:00] <DevePy> Hello, i'm try create system stars, but not can complete 100%, some one help please http://jsfiddle.net/unm5N/4/
[13:16:02] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey the js will edit the CSS of it.
[13:16:17] <Whiskey> the left side alwasys need to have same size as the "right"
[13:16:22] <duch_kazatel> Voyage by "deep" I meant that .find() will go through all descendent nodes and return everything that matches.
[13:16:26] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey it does in my example.
[13:16:41] <Whiskey> yeh but you see it use more width then its need to
[13:16:49] <duch_kazatel> then fix it?
[13:16:53] <Whiskey> yeh how?
[13:16:57] <Whiskey> i have try whole day
[13:17:08] <Whiskey> and you can¬¥t set it in CSS as the JS timer will change the width
[13:17:19] <Whiskey> in right side
[13:17:27] <ilhami> duch_kazatel: www.ilhami.dk --- whats wrong? :D
[13:17:48] <duch_kazatel> ilhami do you knwo what the console is?
[13:18:01] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey then you'll have to get the width of the second TD and set the first one to match.
[13:18:13] <ilhami> duch_kazatel: yes
[13:18:28] <duch_kazatel> open it.  your css file references are bad.
[13:18:47] <duch_kazatel> also - you only need to include one of the bxlsider scripts, bot both.
[13:19:08] <Whiskey> duch, ok lets add some code and show you what my problem actully is
[13:19:11] <ilhami> duch_kazatel: solved. D
[13:19:21] <ilhami> I wrote the wrong path.. :D
[13:19:23] <ilhami> look now
[13:20:02] <duch_kazatel> ilhami ok?
[13:20:12] <ilhami> duch_kazatel but there are still errors in the "console".
[13:20:23] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/6QCcK/9/ check that when timer is on 9-1s hit run
[13:20:38] <Whiskey> you see that it first fix width from the right and the the left
[13:20:41] <duch_kazatel> ilhami yeah. fix those image references.
[13:20:55] <ilhami> duch_kazatel: 2 sec.
[13:21:30] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: do you see that it edit the table two times
[13:22:01] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey why are you dynamically setting the width like that?
[13:22:08] <Whiskey> yeh
[13:22:09] <ilhami> duch_kazatel look now dude..
[13:22:13] <DevePy> duch_kazatel: you can check this system http://jsfiddle.net/unm5N/5/ you think there is something wrong?
[13:22:21] <duch_kazatel> ilhami why am I looking again
[13:22:22] <Whiskey> thats correct what happens, did you see it edit the table 2 times
[13:22:28] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey sure
[13:22:35] <ilhami> duch_kazatel: I fixed the refs :D
[13:22:39] <duch_kazatel> ilhami grats?
[13:22:46] <ilhami> be happy dude.
[13:22:50] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: my problem is that i only like this to happen once but im not even sure that possible
[13:22:52] <duch_kazatel> ilhami i am happy.
[13:23:01] <Whiskey> set width for both sides at same time
[13:23:19] <Whiskey> have try to come up whit something for like 6h its really bugging me
[13:23:29] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i'd end up having to parse through all your code which I don't have time for at the moment, sorry :(
[13:23:52] <ilhami> guys please stop asking duch_kazatel for help.
[13:23:52] <duch_kazatel> i still don't understand why yoiu need to edit the width like that anywya.
[13:23:54] <Whiskey> well the code is not the problem, its that it only set 1 side at the time
[13:23:58] <ilhami> he's not a machine...
[13:24:10] <duch_kazatel> ilhami uh I'm fine thanks.
[13:24:13] <ilhami> LOL
[13:24:13] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: you can¬¥t set eqaul size in CSS in that way as the js does right?
[13:24:26] <Whiskey> then you always need to use a set width, you can set a dynamic one
[13:24:28] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey you can.  you can do 50%.
[13:24:33] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  but I see that i can get  div-1.children("span").first()  div-1> div>span> div> span      despite there is another div in between
[13:24:34] <Whiskey> yeh show me
[13:24:38] <duch_kazatel> I did earlier.
[13:24:44] <Whiskey> whever you set it it won¬¥t work i have try
[13:24:45] <duch_kazatel> it's 50% of the parent.
[13:24:57] <Whiskey> it used more size then the right needed right?
[13:25:01] <duch_kazatel> Voyage can you link to a fiddle?
[13:25:09] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey that second example wasn't using percentages.
[13:25:16] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Having fun?
[13:25:25] <Whiskey> you set 250px
[13:25:26] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hahaha.
[13:25:30] <Whiskey> if it needs more then that it will fail
[13:25:31] <duch_kazatel> lots of bouncing.
[13:25:57] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey right.  you could use 50% instead of a hard set value.
[13:26:03] <duch_kazatel> then modify the width of the poarent container instead.
[13:26:05] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/6QCcK/10/ <--- like here
[13:26:18] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: show me i have try
[13:26:20] <Whiskey> i can¬¥t find it
[13:26:44] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/6QCcK/11/ <-- 50%
[13:26:47] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i didn't have a fully functioning example - i'm pointing you in a direction since I do not have time to pull apart and fully undertstand your code right now.
[13:27:14] <Whiskey> well the 50% not work anyways
[13:27:33] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey not without you modifying your javascript to edit the parent container width appropriately.
[13:28:10] <Whiskey> ok i have no clue how to do that
[13:28:29] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey err, did you write your javascript?
[13:28:35] <Whiskey> yeh parts of it but not all
[13:29:14] <duch_kazatel> so you expect me to go through all that code for you instead?
[13:29:28] <Whiskey> but as i understand it 50% or whatever it is only works if the table are on whole ,page
[13:29:37] <Whiskey> and not like me on a little size
[13:29:53] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey that works fine.
[13:30:13] <duch_kazatel> 50% will set the given element to 50% of the parent container.
[13:30:22] <duch_kazatel> *block level elements, not inline.
[13:30:23] <Whiskey> it won¬¥t expand
[13:30:34] <duch_kazatel> right, because your javascript needs to be modified.
[13:30:36] <Vivekananda> is there a way to comment code in jsfiddle
[13:30:39] <Virtulis> Hi everyone. Is there any way to get vclick functionality from jQuery mobile without anything else? I tried builder but it still screws my DOM up when included.
[13:31:09] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda the same way you comment code in javascript/html.
[13:31:17] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  class="s">
[13:31:24] <Voyage> http://jsfiddle.net/7tC6L/16/
[13:31:59] <duch_kazatel> Voyage that doesn't match anything.
[13:32:13] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i think you wrong i have try everything
[13:32:31] <BillCriswell> lol
[13:32:32] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey oh ok.  bummer for you then!
[13:33:00] <duch_kazatel> you come in here looking for help, I try to point you in a direction, and without being able to prove otherwise, I'm somehow wrong.
[13:33:02] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  yes. the  .children() can match only the first <div> under the #1 . correct ?
[13:33:03] <duch_kazatel> makes sense.
[13:33:13] <duch_kazatel> Voyage yes.
[13:33:22] <Vivekananda> okay got it
[13:33:26] <Whiskey> if you set px to a width
[13:33:27] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  how to correctly match the FIRST occurance of span .s ?
[13:33:30] <Whiskey> and then 50% it won¬¥t work
[13:33:47] <duch_kazatel> Voyage $(".1").find(".s").first()
[13:33:55] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  thx
[13:33:56] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey you're not understanding.
[13:34:12] <Whiskey> i have google this whole day nothing have show me like you say it can be done
[13:34:35] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey because your code is fundamentally wrong.
[13:34:47] <Whiskey> if (parseInt($('#' + id).width()) > minWidthh) {
[13:34:54] <Whiskey> from there 3 lines down all that set the width for it
[13:35:00] <Whiskey> not mutch code to look on
[13:35:14] <duch_kazatel> sure, and then you're setting a width in that check, correct?
[13:35:24] <Whiskey> yeh
[13:35:33] <Whiskey> it sets width for right side
[13:35:35] <duch_kazatel> try reconsidering how you're checking those widths AND what you're setting the width of.
[13:35:51] <Whiskey> yeh its sets the width for 1 td and not all
[13:36:22] <duch_kazatel> okay.  that means.... what to you?
[13:36:31] <Whiskey> welll i think you told me something there
[13:39:09] <duch_kazatel> all right folks i need to get some food.
[13:39:20] <duch_kazatel> be back in a bit.
[13:40:14] <Whiskey> it still does it in 2 steps
[13:40:59] <Whiskey> duch_lunch: i think the problem is that it has to read the js timer first, and then apply it
[13:41:10] <Vivekananda> anyone care to tell me if the fiddle looks sane ? http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/aEKu8/13/

[13:44:47] <Vivekananda> sorry
[13:45:00] <jedimind> looks the same as what
[13:50:44] <Vivekananda> jedimind: sane not same :). I meant to say that the function commented out works fine but the one I am trying to create is using the var "results" as input. I am trying to iterate over it in the same manner as the commented function is doing and then print out each as a dropdown in the box

[14:03:11] <Idealien> I could use some help debugging a fairly basic ajax call that is firing an error response in IE only. It seems to not even attempt to call the REST service from that I can tell.

[14:07:57] <duch_kazatel> aaaah today is beer day at work.
[14:07:59] <duch_kazatel> the best kind of day.
[14:08:50] <Vivekananda> lol
[14:08:53] <Vivekananda> you are back
[14:08:59] <Vivekananda> I am working on getting the fiddle up
[14:09:04] <Vivekananda> around to have a look ?
[14:09:15] <duch_kazatel> i can take a quick poke
[14:09:25] <duch_kazatel> gotta get work done at some point today though.
[14:10:46] <Vivekananda> lol okay
[14:12:05] <Vivekananda> This is the older version -- http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/aEKu8/12/    and right now is this version ( change 12 to 13 in the previous link )  I am working on in which the search box has disappeared. I have only commented out the function and trying to write a new vesion of the same function but is not working :(
[14:12:14] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/6QCcK/12/ how do you get them equal sized, it has no JS
[14:12:48] <Whiskey> and its not possible whitout JS ether
[14:13:12] <Whiskey> if you not set a width in px then it works fine :)
[14:14:52] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda line 11 is throwing an error in version 13.
[14:15:06] <Vivekananda> how did you find that out ?
[14:15:10] <duch_kazatel> the console
[14:15:23] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel?
[14:15:43] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey dude i'm helping somebody else.
[14:15:48] <duch_kazatel> i will talk to you wen I can :)
[14:16:19] <Whiskey> yeh Vivekananda: synax error :D
[14:16:28] <Vivekananda> also how do I fix it ? I thought that function(data) is okay to use
[14:16:47] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda source: results {function (data) { is not valid.
[14:17:10] <Vivekananda> Whiskey: okay but I dont know jquery well enough to know how to include a "function(data)" in my fiddle. If I can do that then I can use the same thing on the actual problem
[14:18:19] <Whiskey> Vivekananda: i suck at this 2 :)
[14:19:18] <Vivekananda> Whiskey: I am trying to learn by example and I concede I dont know jquery well at all. That is why I am struggling to find a way to write the part "function ....." in my fiddle
[14:19:42] <Whiskey> sounds like me :)
[14:19:59] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda try replaceing source: results {function (data) { with source: function (data) {
[14:20:08] <duch_kazatel> and then fix your closing curly/paren combo
[14:21:16] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: but I want to use the variable "results" as the data for the function
[14:23:37] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda huh?  that's not how that works.
[14:24:15] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want to use the results array as your source?
[14:25:53] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: yes for the time being coz my other code ( commented out one ) gets a value from a .php and uses the "data" obtained in the function(data) definition. I want to replicate the same functionality with local values. You only asked me to create afiddle :) and I know not how to get the data inside the fiddle so I am doing that
[14:26:06] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda that code isn't commented out.
[14:28:14] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: in fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/aEKu8/13/  the code for the function below is commented out
[14:28:27] <Vivekananda> if I delete the upper one and try to run then the box disappears
[14:28:35] <duch_kazatel> no it's not.  <!-- --> is not valid for javascript
[14:28:51] <duch_kazatel> using /* */ is
[14:30:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/aEKu8/15/
[14:31:00] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[14:31:29] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I know that but it somehow works on fiddle but okay I will go with yours
[14:31:44] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda actually it doesn't "work in fiddle"
[14:31:53] <duch_kazatel> you're overcomplicating things and not writing javascript.
[14:32:18] <Whiskey> hehe
[14:32:43] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey your styles are weird.  you're not setting an actual with anywhere, so when you do with: 100%;, it doesn't know wtf is up.
[14:32:50] <duch_kazatel> i can't really dig into yours either as a result.
[14:33:03] <duch_kazatel> remove CSS and see when things start working.
[14:33:55] <ss_haze> http://serverfault.com/questions/571410/cant-load-localhost-when-connected-to-internet-using-apache-ubuntu-12-04
[14:35:49] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: yeh i know thats the problem, you can¬¥t get equal size whitout set a width in px, as i told you
[14:37:44] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey a parent container needs to have a fixed width.
[14:37:50] <duch_kazatel> this is something i told you repeatedly.
[14:39:59] <Whiskey> whit that you talk about px right
[14:40:23] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey a parent container must have a set width for percentage values to work on child containers.
[14:42:06] <Whiskey> but it has
[14:42:38] <Whiskey> .Info {width: 50%;}
[14:42:41] <Whiskey> does nothing
[14:42:49] <Whiskey> thats the prarent one
[14:43:21] <duch_kazatel> ... a FIXED WITH.
[14:43:31] <Whiskey> and thats in PX
[14:43:32] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* one sec.
[14:43:36] <duch_kazatel> not, that's not PX.
[14:43:38] <duch_kazatel> that's a percentage.
[14:43:47] <Whiskey> that was a fixed one
[14:43:56] <duch_kazatel> width: 50%; is not a fixed width.
[14:44:23] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[14:46:14] <Vivekananda> let me build it in steps then. Right now this fiddle is working http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/aEKu8/19/ . How I am trying to write an autocomplete in such a way that I can use the function not just for local data but also in a get data scenario. How do I do it ?
[14:47:55] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda i'd suggest finding a tutorial at this point.
[14:48:04] <Whiskey> :P
[14:49:19] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey http://jsfiddle.net/6QCcK/23/
[14:49:22] <duch_kazatel> you'
[14:50:44] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey even better: http://jsfiddle.net/6QCcK/24/
[14:52:09] <Whiskey> no
[14:52:18] <Whiskey> you set width on infoviewbox no width in px as i told
[14:52:53] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:53:07] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey I have you a solution that'll work.  you did not listen to my earlier instructions.
[14:55:11] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: okay then a tutorial it is. I spent the whole day trying to figure out how to attach a :  function(data) to a response and just append it to the current search box
[14:55:31] <Vivekananda> the fiddle was no help
[14:55:35] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda I think you need to learn jquery/javascript :) it'll suit you well at this point.
[14:55:39] <duch_kazatel> the issue is that you don't know basics.
[14:56:37] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: yes I agree but partially. I know the basic structures but I dont know complicated chainings and the code I am working on is not mine but was trying to understand it as is and change a little to accomplish my task
[14:56:46] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: this will not work for me, but this is what i wanted: http://jsfiddle.net/xPCRq/8/
[14:56:57] <Whiskey> only CSS no JS
[14:57:04] <Whiskey> no PX and dynamic :)
[14:57:27] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey sure - change the parent container width instead of an individual TD>
[14:57:31] <therealklanni> Am I late to the party? Whiskey what are you trying to accomplish?
[14:57:44] <duch_kazatel> i'm done at this point.
[14:58:19] <duch_kazatel> i'm leaving.  peace out folks.
[14:58:44] <Whiskey> take care
[14:59:39] <Vivekananda> I am going to try jquery tutorials now
[15:10:11] <synth_> is there a way to tell if an element is animating?
[15:10:43] <synth_> like $("#my_element").on("animate", function(){blahblahblah});
[15:23:44] <HenryCH> Hi everyone. I have the following code to pop up a lightbox slideshow of a few images when the user clicks on one (different) image that is showing on the page: http://jsfiddle.net/2XdC3/
[15:24:50] <HenryCH> But it isn't working (nothing happens on click). The .click fires, and if I remove the .click and the display: none, all images will show and the lightbox does function as expected when clicking on one of them
[15:26:51] <HenryCH> Can anyone think of a way to have the colorbox come up without having to display the images on the screen?
[15:31:32] <Krenair> I'm using deferred.then to chain multiple AJAX queries. Is there some way I can still access .abort on each of them?
[15:32:23] <synth_> is there a way to tell if an element is animating? like $("#my_element").on("animate", function(){blahblahblah});
[15:34:30] <synth_> wtf
[15:48:56] <synth_> http://mellow.me/bbmh/ would someone be able to help me figure out how i can tell when the navbar is being collapsed/expanded on this page? (resize document horizontally until the navbar changes to mobile mode)
[15:53:12] <cohitre> synth_: you can test if the $(".navbar-toggle") is visible
[15:54:58] <synth_> okay, let me see if i can come up with something. my issue is that when you're scrolled to the top, the nav bar is supposed to stay fixed to the bottom of the first "section" so that it appears like a bottom nav, but when you scroll past the first section, it transfers to a fixed top navigation.. i want to be able to control how it expands since when scrolled all the way up, it expands down
[15:54:59] <synth_> off of the page
[15:55:39] <rainabba> $('').html() is the equivalent of getElementById('').innerHtml right?
[15:56:08] <shoky> rainabba yeah more or less
[15:56:35] <rainabba> Just learned a trick that's going to save me HOURS if not days of coding: https://gist.github.com/insin/1031969
[15:58:15] <rainabba> Now to tear it apart, know it and improve on it
[16:01:07] <shoky> yea we've used that trick too at the office, though serverside. doesn't work as smoothly with newer office versions tho
[16:12:02] <beachandbytes> neat trick rainabba , I've always just used serverside
[16:15:49] <rainabba> beachandbytes: Same here for years and it's been painful to say the least, especially since I already have the tables (decorated though) in another report. Now I just strip it down and use that feature. I learned it just a few minutes ago from insin in #javascript
[16:16:14] <rainabba> i fully intend on using this inside Node to give me "server-side" generation and serving of .xls files :0
[16:16:15] <rainabba> :)
[16:20:11] <rainabba> What would it take to convert this plugin so it's not bound to click()? I'd rather $('#mytable').tableToExcel( { options} ); when I choose rather than having to use click();  http://jsfiddle.net/pixelsoul/2MBDq/
[16:21:15] <rainabba> I don't yet understand how plugins are implemented though I suspect it's simple enough.
[16:23:07] <rainabba> Actually, this is what I need right? https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/
[16:27:35] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.  free beer at work.
[16:27:37] <duch_kazatel> the best.
[16:32:07] <Dewin[work]> duch_kazatel: I could totally go for that right now, and I don't even drink beer. It's just been one of those days.
[16:32:22] <duch_kazatel> Dewin[work] I hear that.
[16:33:04] <Dewin[work]> Yeah, I'm sole IT person here and our accounting people were having problems with payroll.  Never a good thing.
[16:33:11] <duch_kazatel> ouch.
[16:33:15] <duch_kazatel> that blows.
[16:33:57] <Dewin[work]> Bad enough that the people that make the software released a mandatory update on January 28th.  You know, with 3 days for IT staff to test it, when things like tax forms are legally required to be done.
[16:34:42] <duch_kazatel> what the hell?  doesn't your SLA cover anything like that?
[16:35:38] <Dewin[work]> Actually this is the first problem we had, and it was fixed by reinstalling the client.  Which apparently needs to be done on EVERY client, since the accounting people tried the whole payroll thing on multiple machines before coming to me.
[16:35:56] <duch_kazatel> woah.  intense.
[16:35:59] <Dewin[work]> But yeah, some bad things all around.
[16:36:34] <duch_kazatel> i remember working tech support.
[16:36:36] <duch_kazatel> never again/.
[16:38:28] <synth_> http://mellow.me/bbmh/ could someone tell me why, when the window is resized horizontally until the mobile navigation shows up, the toggle navigation button works only on the first toggle? code that i'm running for that toggle: http://pastebin.com/zheuTG0K
[16:39:10] <Dewin[work]> duch_kazatel: My job title is Database Developer, which isn't particularly accurate.  But when you're the only tech savvy guy at a ~17 person non-profit other things just kind of happen.  I actually like the variety though.
[16:39:16] <Dewin[work]> I'd never want to be a normal helpdesk though.
[16:39:59] <duch_kazatel> synth_ there should be code for that nav click event.
[16:40:30] <synth_> that's controlled through bootstrap
[16:40:32] <synth_> hm
[16:41:02] <duch_kazatel> Dewin[work] i was a project manager type in my case - wound up handling a lot of tier-2 style tech support at the same time.  our clients were all newspapers.
[16:41:30] <synth_> wait i got it
[16:41:42] <duch_kazatel> figure it out synth_?
[16:41:43] <synth_> had to do shown.bs.collapse instead of show
[16:41:48] <duch_kazatel> hah
[16:41:50] <duch_kazatel> there you go!
[16:42:04] <synth_> since height was being forced to 0 after the first collapse
[16:42:14] <Dewin[work]> duch_kazatel: Yeah, I actually know and interact with most of our office on a regular non-IT basis, so that changes it some.  Also, considering it was payroll, I wasn't getting paid until it was fixed so some pretty powerful incentive right there :-p
[16:42:15] <synth_> so it was trying to do scrollTop of the height of 0
[16:42:25] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[16:42:29] <duch_kazatel> Dewin[work] that's fair.
[16:43:04] <duch_kazatel> i mean, it sucks, but i see that.
[16:53:41] <DevePy> Hello, guys how to optimized this system rating: http://jsfiddle.net/9hC6F/1/
[16:56:31] <duch_kazatel> DevePy that looks about right.
[16:58:03] <DevePy> duch_kazatel: Yes, but need add one div, if hover 5 stars show this number in one div, you know ?
[16:58:28] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want to show the star rating they're currently hovered over?
[16:58:56] <DevePy> yes
[16:59:10] <DevePy> <div class="txt">value</div>
[16:59:24] <duch_kazatel> where are you stuf?

[16:59:31] <duch_kazatel> like, have you tried?
[17:00:01] <DevePy> if you've tried but failed
[17:00:09] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:00:29] <duch_kazatel> let me rephrase - have you even tried to implement the functionality or are you asking for free dev work?
[17:02:15] <DevePy> I mean I have not been able to work
[17:02:23] <DevePy> my bad english sorry jejeje
[17:03:54] <duch_kazatel> DevePy http://jsfiddle.net/9hC6F/2/
[17:05:48] <DevePy> duch_kazatel: Yes thanks for this
[17:06:22] <duch_kazatel> DevePy what did you have before this?
[17:07:55] <DevePy> duch_kazatel: i'm used event click and put value in input "value"
[17:10:42] <duch_kazatel> DevePy have you tried learning jquery/javascript?
[17:10:46] <duch_kazatel> that was incredibly simple.
[19:03:20] <fris> i have <ul id="rp_playlist post-107"> and im using $("ul#rp_playlist post-107") not sure if that is right, it works without the post-107
[19:04:24] <tw2113> not sure things can have multiple IDs
[19:05:08] <fris> ill try switching to class
[19:36:05] <evilbug> i have an element doing a slideToggle via: if(browserWidth >= 1024) { $(".toggle").click(function() {$("#nav").slideToggle; }); } and it runs fine except for when i resize the browser window, then the js acts weird. isn't the code technically supposed to be ignored if the browser is under 1024px wide?
[19:37:11] <jphase> evilbug: that depends on how "browserWidth" is set
[19:37:58] <evilbug> jphase: var browserWidth = $(window).width();
[19:39:08] <jphase> hm, should be fine I'd think. what I normally do in those situations is $(window).resize(function(){ console.log($(this).width()); });
[19:39:24] <jphase> then you can open your console and make sure the width is good when you resize
[19:45:12] <evilbug> jphase: yeah, the width seems to be outputting fine.
[19:45:22] <jphase> odd
[19:45:40] <evilbug> i'll look again through all my css as well.
[19:45:42] <jphase> oh
[19:45:51] <jphase> haha, don't bind the click event inside the if block
[19:45:57] <jphase> use the if block in your click event
[19:45:59] <jphase> ya dig?
[19:47:33] <evilbug> ah, ok. why i did that is because i have a bunch more things that are supposed to behave a bit differently if width is >= 1024px.
[19:47:57] <jphase> yeah, binding events happens like a stack - you add things onto it and they stick there
[19:49:45] <evilbug> thanks for the heads up, i'll rewrite this stuff and see what up.
[19:52:41] <jphase> word up
[20:02:21] <evilbug> jphase: actually care to take a look at my jquery and let me know what you think in terms of arrangement, sense, and efficiency? i'm a js noob and could use some feedback.
[20:02:47] <jphase> sure, http://paste.ofcode.org  is my favorite pastebin if you don't mind
[20:02:49] <jphase> that or hastebin.com
[20:03:05] <jphase> the first of which has sexy sublime textish highlighting ;)
[20:05:13] <evilbug> jphase: meh i don't mind pastebin or codepen > http://paste.ofcode.org/aQAZ2VAjNTbSB7SCzTruxK
[20:05:25] <evilbug> jphase: but i do love sublime with molokai.
[20:06:36] <jphase> I normally do my window resize events outside of doc ready (might be just me idk) - and inside that event, $(window).anything can just be $(this).anything
[20:07:05] <jphase> where's that click event you used to have?
[20:09:29] <jphase> oh nvm, it's that .toggle click
[20:09:30] <jphase> I see it
[20:11:38] <jphase> evilbug: so this prependTo and appendTo is supposed to happen when the window resizes < 1024px (not on click)?
[20:12:14] <evilbug> jphase: yes, just on resizing.
[20:12:26] <jphase> k
[20:12:53] <evilbug> jphase: it's just the menu toggle and the discography fade that give me some bugs on my resizing.
[20:13:47] <evilbug> and why would you resize outside of doc ready?
[20:14:01] <jphase> well they're both different events
[20:14:10] <jphase> it doesn't matter really, I think that's just a preference
[20:14:47] <evilbug> ok, but overall does it look fine?
[20:15:12] <jphase> yeah, I'd do some things different - but it may just be preference and you can ditch whatever you don't like, one sec
[20:17:19] <jphase> evilbug: http://paste.ofcode.org/3gS4jbpM7DcTaXLTvKyLWG
[20:17:39] <jphase> I mostly just took your events (click and hover) and stuck them up in doc ready with a window width check
[20:17:56] <jphase> oh hmm
[20:18:04] <jphase> lines 20-22 are redundant
[20:18:11] <jphase> since that's in the else on 30-32
[20:18:19] <jphase> I think?
[20:18:48] <jphase> but mostly I just wanted to take the click and hover events and stick them up on doc ready cause you don't want to bind those only when the window is resized
[20:19:05] <evilbug> yeah, those are redundant but i get it.
[20:19:06] <jphase> bind them and only fire your event (fadeToggle and slideToggle) when the window is the dimension you want
[20:19:23] <evilbug> alright, thanks for that i'll try it out.
[20:25:13] <evilbug> jphase: do you recommend and page preloaders? i'm looking to add one because the append stuff looks choppy on load and i don't want to have that.
[20:25:48] <jphase> like a loader bar type-deal?
[20:26:02] <jphase> I normally do those all custom
[20:26:31] <evilbug> a bar, a circle thing, whatever as long as it looks nice.
[20:27:07] <jphase> honestly, most of the time I use things like ajaxload.info (just a gif image)
[20:27:10] <jphase> and then do things like...
[20:29:05] <jphase> $('div#target_you_append_to').html($('<img>').attr('src', 'ajaxloader.gif'));  and then append your other thing
[20:29:34] <jphase> like, bad and horribly old school example of something I did this on is http://closettheory.com
[20:29:41] <jphase> granted that was like 6 years ago, so don't judge
[20:30:09] <jphase> but when you click into the site, there's a loader until the image is loaded (I used jQuery's .load event to know when the image was loaded) and then removed the loader gif
[20:32:18] <jphase> but yeah, if the initial content is a loading gif, and then you do something like $('<img>').attr('src', 'yourimage.jpg').load(function(){ $('img.loadinggif').remove(); $(this).appendTo('div.target'); });  it should work just fine
[20:32:19] <evilbug> that's pretty cool, i like how that works.
[20:32:26] <jphase> then you don't need some bloated loader plugin
[20:32:41] <evilbug> dope, thanks for the tip.
[20:33:00] <jphase> sure thing
[20:34:01] <evilbug> jphase: you're, like, the js buddy i never had!
[20:34:13] <jphase> awe <3
[20:34:19] <evilbug> <3 plur!
[20:34:26] <jphase> lol, haven't heard plur in SO long
[20:34:29] <jphase> since my raver days
[20:34:42] <evilbug> i rave all day err day!
[20:36:25] <jphase> unSS uNSSS UNSSS
[20:36:29] <evilbug> funny you say that, i'm gonna head out to a club shortly.
[20:36:41] <jphase> hehe, if you only could hear the music I'm bumpin' right now
[20:36:53] <evilbug> blow my hair back and my socks off.
[20:37:12] <jphase> I used to be a breakbeat dj - now I listen to tons of electro stuff as my coder music
[20:37:18] <jphase> lyrics tend to distract me
[20:37:47] <evilbug> jphase: actually when i code i either like ambient/drony stuff or dnb.
[20:38:03] <evilbug> or soundtracks too.
[20:38:05] <jphase> I love me some downbeats and chill house too
[20:38:14] <jphase> dnb is fun but I can only code to it for about 2 hours
[20:38:18] <jphase> mimosa ftw
[20:38:38] <jphase> I'm from portland, oregon so I love all the nw djs too
[20:38:42] <jphase> glitchmob, etc.
[20:39:42] <evilbug> no doubt, i like glitch mob. i'm in l.a.
[20:39:57] <evilbug> good ol' california.
[20:39:58] <jphase> right on, PLENTY of good music from there
[20:40:10] <evilbug> and tons of venues out in hollywood.
[20:40:11] <jphase> I live in Florida now next to Tampa
[20:40:26] <jphase> yeah, I love that area
[20:40:31] <evilbug> oh wow, how's the scene over there?
[20:40:45] <jphase> I don't really know - only been here about 3 months
[20:40:55] <jphase> but I've felt some bump in downtown tampa
[20:40:59] <jphase> just haven't been to a full on show yet
[20:41:31] <evilbug> go get crunk!
[20:41:57] <evilbug> actually it's friday, why aren't you out?
[20:42:21] <jphase> bah, got this friggin' client outside of work that I'm doing work for
[20:43:03] <evilbug> yeah, i know the hustle.
[20:43:07] <jphase> actually the site I linked you to - have to recode her site entirely but not like a noob this time, and then doing this advanced session based cart for a wordpress site atm
[20:43:10] <evilbug> hope the money's good though.
[20:43:31] <jphase> definitely good skrilla, but being inside on a friday drinking in a dark corner is sad panda
[20:44:10] <jphase> ÀÅÀö·¥•ÀöÀÄ
[20:44:14] <evilbug> i've done that numerous times especially when i was in europe during winter blizzard and really didn't feel like stepping out.
[20:45:38] <evilbug> jphase: i gotta start getting ready, man. thanks again for the help, really appreciate it. see you around.
[20:45:49] <jphase> for sure, ciao for now ;)
[20:45:55] <evilbug> pees.
[21:01:01] <evilbug> jphase: one more thing, i notice that if i place my vars outside of the resize on line 3, my append and prepend don't work anymore. why is that? http://paste.ofcode.org/aQAZ2VAjNTbSB7SCzTruxK
[21:02:24] <jphase> evilbug: you're setting the vars but they don't get updated when the windows changes dimensions
[21:02:43] <jphase> so it'll only set them once on doc ready (aka the initial size when loaded)
[21:07:11] <evilbug> oh i gotcha, ok. thanks.
[21:11:41] <DevePy> why when refresh page, in form not remove values
[21:17:38] <jphase> DevePy: your browser will autofill form values that it remembers. You can do something like <form autocomplete="off".....>   to remove that
[21:18:52] <DevePy> jphase: thanks i'm check this
[21:22:46] <Siecje> I'm using jqueryui 1.6 and I am setting cursor: 'move' on a draggable handle but the cursor is not changing
[21:29:45] <Vivekananda> trying to understand why $('.item').click(function() { $(this).remove();});   wont work
[21:40:39] <jphase> Vivekananda: can you make a jsfiddle? cause that most definitely should work
[21:45:05] <jphase> Siecje: you too pls - 'move' should also work
[21:51:01] <soCalled> Hello, I wrote a plugin hosted on github and am writing the documentation. There is a single function, hypermatic(). Example usage is $(element).hypermatic(whatever);  My question is what form should that function take in the documentation? Possibilities in markdown:
[21:51:03] <soCalled> ### hypermatic()
[21:51:12] <soCalled> ### jquery.hypermatic()
[21:51:25] <soCalled> ### $(element).hypermatic()
[21:51:45] <soCalled> This is supposed to be the header for the function. How should I write it?
[21:53:59] <soCalled> I chose the first. https://github.com/KevinDoughty/Hypermatic/blob/master/README.md
[21:55:19] <soCalled> Check out the animation demos: http://kxdx.org/animated-tree-menu/ and http://kxdx.org/negative-delta-float/
[22:07:07] <zumba_addict> hey folks, I need some help on how to update Firstname and Lastname without deleting the img src value - http://pastie.org/8687744
[22:09:59] <jphase> zumba_addict: wrap the text in a span tag and use .text on the span
[22:10:10] <zumba_addict> k
[22:10:26] <zumba_addict> so span will be also inside <p></p>?
[22:10:42] <jphase> yes
[22:10:46] <zumba_addict> k
[22:10:54] <zumba_addict> i'll look for the code now. Thanks
[22:11:05] <jphase> np
[22:12:21] <zumba_addict> ok, glad it didn't ruin the style :)
[22:13:02] <zumba_addict> it worked! :D
[22:13:18] <zumba_addict> $('p.current-user span').text('Awesome')
[22:13:36] <zumba_addict> thanks a lot!!!!!!!
