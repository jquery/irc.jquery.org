[00:00:02] <Unopoo> Cork: thx
[00:34:59] <ThKo> Hi everyone, short question: Why is it not possible to use the variables in line 16 to 18 in the function 22 to 35? Thanks a lot!   http://jsfiddle.net/mbdtorgc/1/
[00:36:08] <xec> ThKo: in a word? closure
[00:36:35] <xec> err sorry i missed the word "not"
[00:36:53] <ThKo> xec: So there’s no way to use it?
[00:37:16] <Uhkis> pass them as parameters?
[00:37:19] <xec> no, you *can* use them
[00:37:29] <xec> except, they won't run before line 37
[00:37:51] <xec> because i assume the onsuccess is an async event (happens later on)
[00:37:59] <ThKo> When I alert on line 38 in output is only the part of line 20 and 37
[00:38:08] <xec> ThKo: exactly.
[00:38:10] <ThKo> Ah I understand! Async is the problem
[00:40:37] <xec> ThKo: you could create a reference to an element that is attached to the dom, and inside the callback, attach a new li to it (instead of appending to a string)
[00:41:00] <ThKo> That’s an idea, I’ll tryi t
[00:49:02] <xec> ThKo: that might be rather inefficient though, if dealing with many records
[00:50:54] <xec> ThKo: as it will trigger a reflow on each iteration. might be better if the <ul> is off-dom and attach it after you've reached the last record
[01:26:17] <hxm> hi guys
[01:26:41] <hxm> i want to create a div with contentEditable for allow the user to add text and images, then send that context to the server
[01:27:04] <hxm> i did it in this way: <div contenteditable="true" name="message" id="message" class="form-control" rows="9" cols="25" required="required" placeholder="Suéltalo">
[01:27:17] <hxm> but when i write in the div each \n creates a <div>line</div>
[01:27:29] <hxm> can i avoid that or can that be sent as raw text to the server?
[01:43:05] <norc> Hi. I have an ajax call that expects a JSON. Is there a way to catch the exception being thrown when it cant parse the JSON for whatever reason?
[01:45:50] <ThKo> norc: Please paste your code at jsfiddle :-) I’ll have a look
[01:46:22] <norc> ThKo: Let me think of a way to make a fiddle out of this. Give me a minute.
[02:04:16] <neo2k> hi, can somebody tell me how I can ignore option default values from being serialized by $("#form").serialze()?
[02:04:44] <norc> ThKo: Yeah I cant figure this out. Its way too big to make a fiddle test case out of this.
[02:09:30] <Cork> neo2k: give the default option an empty value <option value="">default</option>
[03:11:34] <jop008> hi I want to make a regexp containing all *.js files but not *.min.js
[03:13:13] <Uhkis> thanks for telling us :-)
[03:13:49] <Xatenev> :D
[03:13:49] <Xatenev> ikr
[03:14:58] <jop008> no thx
[03:30:11] <Cork> jop008: negative matching in regex is messy
[03:30:23] <Cork> if possible your better of doing it in two searches
[03:31:35] <jop008> okay I want to minimize my project and do *.js to min.js grunt failed now using yuicompresser but osx terminal is not that easy as msdos batch file I noticed. e.g xcopy is missing
[03:32:25] <Cork> heh
[03:32:37] <Cork> jop008: no osx uses a unix terminal
[03:32:46] <Cork> so it is much more powerful then msdos
[03:33:01] <Cork> you prob want to look into the command find
[03:38:18] <Cork> jop008: anyway for the question /(?!min\.js$).{3}\.js$/ should work
[03:38:53] <Cork> actually /(?!min).{3}\.js$/ is enough
[03:47:50] * CssNoob What do you do if you feel sleepy at work?
[04:03:01] <Kartagis> CssNoob: lose the /ame
[04:04:33] <CssNoob> Why?
[04:09:16] <Kartagis> using /ame for asking a question is lame and annoying
[04:09:44] <Kartagis> CssNoob: not to mention it's not what /ame has been created for
[04:10:36] <Uhkis> it's created solely for annoying people
[04:11:52] <CssNoob> What is it for then?
[04:13:00] <Kartagis> CssNoob: for announcing status
[04:13:05] <Kartagis> like
[04:13:22] * Kartagis is solely annoyed by this behaviour
[04:13:35] <Kartagis> s/sole/true/
[04:13:45] <Kartagis> s/true/tru/
[04:13:58] <CssNoob> Hmm
[04:14:21] <Kartagis> Uhkis++
[04:19:29] <CssNoob> Could someone critique my newbie website template that I created http://raineerdelarita.comuv.com/nerpets/index.html#
[04:25:54] <hxm> how to add a file to a form data?
[04:27:12] <Uhkis> CssNoob: missing responsiveness
[04:28:04] <CssNoob> I'm new to CSS, got so much to learn. Not to responsive yet
[04:35:40] <Duce1nik> how do I remove an element that contain a certain ID?  This is what I got but it's not working http://jsfiddle.net/fz28La8t/1/
[04:37:12] <Haprog> Duce1nik: You don't have jQuery loaded on the fiddle.
[04:37:44] <Haprog> "$ is not defined"
[04:39:29] <Uhkis> Duce1nik: http://jsfiddle.net/fz28La8t/5/
[04:39:36] <Uhkis> yo Haprog =)
[04:39:40] <Haprog> yo :P
[04:41:03] <Duce1nik> Uhkis I need it to remove  the  class ui-checkbox
[04:41:19] <Duce1nik> that contain certain ID in the child element
[04:41:37] <Uhkis> Duce1nik: then use .ui-checkbox instead of #649
[04:42:05] <Uhkis> oh that continued
[04:42:16] <Duce1nik> Uhkis but that would delete all ui-checkbox
[04:43:02] <Haprog> I guess he wan't to delete the parent of #649
[04:43:10] <Haprog> *wants
[04:43:18] <Uhkis> Duce1nik: http://jsfiddle.net/fz28La8t/6/ ugly but works :D
[04:43:46] <Duce1nik> Uhkis hahah as long as it work.. Thanks
[04:43:56] <Haprog> I think all he wants is $('#649').parent().remove();
[04:45:16] <Duce1nik> Haprog Thanks
[04:45:16] <Uhkis> i followed his description to the letter!
[04:45:43] <lolmaus> I'm doing $img.on('load error', function() { ... }) for a bunch of images on the page. For some reason, the callback fires fewer times than there are images, though all images appear loaded on the page. Why?
[04:47:45] <Uhkis> btw Haprog wasn't it you that helped me when i was learning jQuery for the first time
[04:48:08] <Haprog> Uhkis: I don't remember. maybe? :D
[04:48:33] <Haprog> I haven't even used IRC in few years almost at all.
[04:49:07] <lolmaus> Ok, i got this! Answer to my question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3877027/jquery-callback-on-image-load-even-when-the-image-is-cached
[04:58:03] <mattjs5> anyone know how i can submit to a google form from outside the form (just as an http post or get request) that requires a login to view the form?
[04:58:43] <miCSu> is it possible to make ajax request that waits until another ajax request on the responsive site's been called ?
[04:59:08] <User458764> How do I search all elements with attributes itemscope="foo"?
[05:00:33] <Cork> mattjs5: if you mean from outside an iframe or something like that?
[05:00:59] <miCSu> User458764: have you tried $("*[iterscope='foo']")
[05:01:20] <User458764> miCSu no I will, thanks
[05:01:21] <Cork> the star isn't needed
[05:01:30] <Cork> also you should avoid selectors like that
[05:04:39] <Xatenev> Cork: why?
[05:04:57] <Cork> Xatenev: cause they are slow
[05:05:05] <Xatenev> Ah ok
[05:05:11] <Xatenev> ty for info
[05:05:13] <Cork> your not using any of the caches the browser provides
[05:05:24] <Xatenev> How wouild u search elements with attribute xyz thne?
[05:05:49] <Cork> #id > .class >>>> element >>>> attribute >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> :contains
[05:06:09] <Cork> Xatenev: you should first limit it by ex a class or a parent
[05:06:16] <Cork> and then search by attribute from there
[05:06:19] <Xatenev> Ah okay
[05:06:28] <Cork> the slow part is from that it has to search through the entire dom
[05:06:35] <Cork> element + attribute
[05:06:38] <Xatenev> But id for example aswell, no?
[05:06:42] <Xatenev> when i earch $('#whatever')
[05:06:43] <Cork> no
[05:06:51] <Cork> #id is a hash table loop up
[05:07:03] <Cork> it is basically as fast as a variable access
[05:07:14] <Xatenev> Oh okay cool
[05:07:14] <Cork> .class is the same
[05:07:30] <Cork> element name has to travers
[05:07:40] <Xatenev> Why doesnt it uses hash tables for the attribute selctor
[05:07:40] <Xatenev> aswell?
[05:07:43] <Cork> but at least it isn't O^n
[05:07:47] <Cork> no
[05:07:52] <Cork> it has to loop every element
[05:07:59] <Cork> and then loop each attribute on the each element
[05:07:59] <Xatenev> Hm but why
[05:08:09] <Cork> and then check the value on each attribute on each element
[05:08:10] <Xatenev> Oh well true
[05:08:16] <Xatenev> hash tables just find the position
[05:08:19] <Cork> and that is why it is slow :)
[05:08:24] <Xatenev> so its probably unable to find the attribute
[05:08:25] <Cork> don't find
[05:08:26] <Cork> it knows
[05:08:36] <Cork> it is a table point to the specific element
[05:08:39] <Cork> no need to search
[05:08:41] <Xatenev> well yeah, i mean hash tables are generated
[05:09:01] <Xatenev> by using mathematic functions to get the positions
[05:09:02] <Cork> they are generated as you attach an element to the dom
[05:09:02] <Xatenev> inside the table
[05:09:05] <Cork> not when you search
[05:09:13] <Xatenev> hm yeah
[05:09:15] <Xatenev> okay :)
[05:09:19] <Xatenev> nice info :)
[05:09:29] <Xatenev> thats why im inside irc! :p
[05:09:37] <Cork> so they basically do return hash_table[id]
[05:09:49] <Cork> and that is all it needs to do when you find by id
[05:10:11] <Cork> (there is some js wrapping they need to add, but simplified)
[05:10:37] <Xatenev> Does it work like that in normal JS aswell?
[05:10:43] <Xatenev> or is that some jquery related stuff
[05:12:23] <Cork> Xatenev: that is how it works in normal js
[05:12:36] <Cork> jquery wrapps that in functions that do some extra work
[05:12:47] <Xatenev> Ah okay
[05:13:38] <Xatenev> very nice to know that hehe
[05:14:00] <hxm> hello, i try to send a form with a file upload and i do this: var media = $('#media').val(); var postData = $('#addqueue').serialize()+'&date='+$('#date').val()+'&message='+message+'&media='+    media;
[05:14:08] <hxm> media only contains the file path
[05:14:22] <hxm> how to attach the file to the post? for some reason when i use .ajax it wont add the file
[05:29:11] <Cork> hxm: you can't do it like that
[05:29:32] <Cork> hxm: to start of you don't want to serialize the image to a string in js before sending it
[05:29:44] <Cork> hxm: and to do an ajax post you need to use formData
[05:29:47] <Cork> ?mdn formData
[05:29:48] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData

[05:34:51] <Axy> Hello all - I am currently creating a chatroom and when I use append it is very vulnerable since it apso appends regular text as html elements (if the text includes that)
[05:35:02] <Axy> but when I just edit the .text with jquery, then I can't get proper hyperlinks
[05:35:06] <Axy> Any solutions?
[05:35:18] <dan_j> Hi. I'm trying out jquery ajax for the first time. If I want to retrieve a list of data (name/value keys), whats the best way to format the returned data so that I can process it and reference it easily within javascript?
[05:39:55] <sacho_> dan_j, json
[05:41:10] <Cork> ya, json every time
[05:42:01] <dan_j> Thanks. I thought json was going to be complicated but just found a utility for asp which will really help.
[05:42:04] <dan_j> Thanks for the advice.
[05:42:33] <Cork> dan_j: json is a simple structure and is supported by basically any language
[05:51:07] <phanlord> is there a bootstrap specific channel

[05:52:41] <mikunos> hi guys I have used $.post in this way http://snipet.co.uk/VX but on success the data value is not innered in the html div object
[05:52:45] <mikunos> why?
[05:52:53] <mikunos> data is full of information
[05:53:30] <Cork> mikunos: your createing an object with $() and then create a property innerHTML on it
[05:53:51] <mikunos> ???
[05:53:51] <Cork> mikunos: .innerHTML is a dom property not jquery
[05:53:54] <Cork> you want .html()
[05:54:02] <mikunos> oh shiiiiit!
[05:54:35] <mikunos> no no Cork, it is the same
[05:55:00] <mikunos> my fault
[05:55:09] <mikunos> $('#eventsclosetome').html(data);
[05:55:17] <mikunos> this is right!
[05:55:23] <mikunos> thanks Cork!
[05:55:27] <Cork> np
[05:55:38] <Macaveli> How do I download a file via jquery from url and add it to a input_tag
[05:55:44] <Macaveli> any ideas?
[05:55:59] <Cork> Macaveli: you don't download files on the web
[05:56:08] <Cork> you access resources
[05:56:19] <burzum> I wrote this plugin for my app http://pastebin.com/ec9rhfnw but when I try to change the success callback in the options im geting a TypeError from the jquery lib, any idea why?
[05:56:50] <Cork> Macaveli: if you want to get the content of say an html resource you do $.get('url').done(function(data) {});
[05:57:20] <Macaveli> Cork I need to do make sometime like this the dropbox part https://workingatbooking.com/vacancies/innovation-specialist-online-marketing-new-partnerships/apply/?_department=Account+Management&_country=Netherlands&_city=Amsterdam
[05:58:07] <Cork> burzum: firstly attach likeApi on $ not $.fn
[05:58:25] <Cork> burzum: secondly what is the error?
[05:58:35] <burzum> TypeError: a is undefined
[05:58:42] <pikaren> how does andSelf() work
[05:58:50] <burzum> Its coming from the lib itself, not my code
[05:58:57] <pikaren> how does it knows who was the self
[05:59:01] <Cork> pikaren: andSelf is deprecated
[05:59:03] <Cork> use addBack
[05:59:17] <burzum> Cork why should I attach it to $ and not $.fn?
[05:59:18] <Cork> (it is basically the same thing though)
[05:59:28] <Cork> burzum: cause it isn't a selector function
[05:59:33] <burzum> oh true
[05:59:37] <burzum> its my first plugin
[05:59:43] <Cork> and that is proven by the fact that you call it as $.fn.likeApi
[06:00:02] <pikaren> Cork: eh
[06:00:02] <Cork> burzum: also you might want to make that a private function instead of hooking it on the public interface
[06:00:08] <pikaren> Cork: how does it work?
[06:00:19] <Cork> pikaren: jquery has a chain cache
[06:00:23] <burzum> Cork how do I do that in js?
[06:00:26] <Cork> where it keeps old selections
[06:00:41] <pikaren> Cork: oh thats awful
[06:00:43] <pikaren> thanks
[06:00:44] <Cork> pikaren: and it just reference that cache and push it into the current one
[06:00:47] <Cork> pikaren: yes it is
[06:00:56] <Cork> pikaren: it is a big source of memory leaks
[06:01:29] <Cork> window.t = $('*').filter('#target'); <-- you've just leaked every element on the page
[06:01:49] <burzum> Cork, ive made the changes you suggested but this doesnt resolve the error im getting.
[06:01:52] <pikaren> hmm rly awful
[06:02:01] <Cork> burzum: you would have to create an <a> element and link it to what you want to download
[06:02:05] <Cork> and ask the user to click it
[06:02:10] <Cork> pikaren: yes it is
[06:02:30] <Cork> pikaren: it is bad enough that i have a "plugin" that rips these parts out of jquery
[06:03:18] <Cork> delete $.fn.end; delete $.fn.unwrap; delete $.fn.fadeTo; <-- these methods depend on it
[06:03:30] <Cork> and a replacement for $.fn.pushStack
[06:03:36] <Cork> that doesn't create a stack
[06:04:01] <pikaren> hmm you can make a cache less fork :p
[06:04:02] <burzum> Cork it is already attached to an <a> element. But I see the issue now, its the scope. Crap :(
[06:04:09] <burzum> Cork thank you!
[06:04:32] <Cork> less fork?
[06:04:39] <pikaren> cache-less xD
[06:04:55] <Cork> why fork it when i can just remove it from the other one?
[06:05:07] <Cork> a fork means i would have to update it on every new jquery release
[06:05:28] <pikaren> and you become famous
[06:05:35] <Cork> not likely
[06:57:05] <Eckyecky> Hi guys. I have clickhandler on a like button which saves the like to the db with an ajax call. Now in case the user is not logged in, the click handler should not do the ajaxcall but show an alert. So in the javascript I need to do an auth check ajax call each time the user clicks on a like icon. Is there a better way to do this?the
[06:57:51] <cjohnson> your message got cut off
[06:57:57] <grkblood13> is there a way to resize a window.open() popup to the size of the main div container it loads? I've been having trouble with this because resizeTo() takes into account the width of the browsers border and this varies quite a bit.
[06:58:03] <Eckyecky> I have clickhandler on a like button which saves the like to the db with an ajax call. Now in case the user is not logged in, the click handler should not do the ajaxcall but show an alert.
[06:58:07] <Eckyecky> So in the javascript I need to do an auth check ajax call each time the user clicks on a like icon. Is there a better way to do this?
[06:58:15] <cjohnson> ideally your backend should just be handle the logged out user and respond with an error
[06:58:20] <cjohnson> no need for a second request
[06:58:35] <cjohnson> if the user isn't logged in and they submit the ajax request, it returns an error, and your frontend handles it
[06:59:00] <Eckyecky> but then the ajax call will still be made. Can't it be done without an ajaxcall at all?
[06:59:05] <cjohnson> no of course not
[06:59:23] <cjohnson> unless you have some way of determining the user's state from the frontend. you could guess by looking at the cookies
[06:59:23] <Eckyecky> like storing loggedin='1' as a tag attribute in the dom
[06:59:28] <cjohnson> but that won't tell you if the server has logged you out
[06:59:47] <Eckyecky> yeah true
[06:59:53] <cjohnson> Eckyecky: so the user is logged in, the user loads the page, the server sets loggedin='1', the user sits there for 30 minutes. the server session times out. the user clicks like
[06:59:58] <cjohnson> now the dom attribute is irrelevant
[07:00:09] <Eckyecky> yes, bad solution ;d
[07:00:11] <cjohnson> so yeah you'll have to make the ajax request each time
[07:00:15] <cjohnson> what's the harm in it?
[07:00:21] <cjohnson> your backend should be handling that use case anyway
[07:00:30] <Eckyecky> I'm just worried about performance that way
[07:00:48] <Eckyecky> at least I dont have to do a DB query
[07:01:25] <cjohnson> performance in which aspect?
[07:01:34] <cjohnson> the user clicked a button, a few ms request isn't going to bother anything
[07:02:15] <cjohnson> if you're really concerned about the overhead, use SPDY or websockets or something
[07:02:51] <Eckyecky> so in the php script I echo 1 or 0 for example?
[07:02:57] <cjohnson> ?
[07:04:08] <Eckyecky> maybe I am paranoia
[07:04:15] <cjohnson> I'm not sure what you're asking now
[07:04:24] <cjohnson> echo 1 or 0 for what? in which script?
[07:04:29] <Eckyecky> in the success function of the ajax call
[07:04:51] <Eckyecky> the returndata should represent if it was a success or 0 if he's not logged in for example
[07:04:55] <Eckyecky> so I can show the alert
[07:05:05] <cjohnson> ahhh, yeah. generally I do something like this
[07:05:14] <cjohnson> {success:0, error: 'User isnt logged int'}
[07:05:22] <cjohnson> (with proper JSON of course)
[07:05:44] <Eckyecky> yes better than just 0
[07:06:03] <cjohnson> indeed. maybe even a type
[07:06:19] <cjohnson> {success:0, error: 'NotLoggedIn', message: 'The user isnt logged in, blah blah'}
[07:06:25] <cjohnson> depends how many error cases you're catching
[07:06:28] <Eckyecky> do you echo or return that json?
[07:06:42] <cjohnson> well how are you currently outputting your jSON?
[07:06:59] <Eckyecky> I just echo 1; now
[07:07:31] <cjohnson> echo is PHP's method of returning data to the client, yes
[07:07:48] <cjohnson> echo json_encode($return);  should work assuming $return is a valid data structure
[07:07:50] <Eckyecky> so echoing json is ok?
[07:07:58] <Eckyecky> ok
[07:08:03] <cjohnson> that's a PHP question not a jquery question ;) but yes
[07:14:00] <Eckyecky> Hm, what is wrong with this: echo json_encode({'success': 0, 'error' : 'Not logged in'}); :p
[07:15:01] <Eckyecky> nvm
[07:27:05] <hactor> Folks when I set html() on an element which has <script> what's actually going on in jquery
[07:27:17] <hactor> Because I see some weird order of execution of embedded scripts.
[07:27:47] <dANO_> Hi i have question about animation and keyframes  in css3 anyone can help ?
[07:29:59] <cjohnson> don't ask to ask dANO_
[07:30:00] <cjohnson> just ask
[07:32:40] <dANO_> I try to use keyframes for move some text.So I use this sass : https://gist.github.com/fclement21/cc9267f88143cbe1fd58 , but when i use % like the first file that doesnt work but if i use px , that work how I can fix this problem and use %
[07:40:37] <varchar> dANO_, when you say it doesn't work, you're saying that it strips the %'s?
[07:46:14] <dANO_> varchar: it's ok I fine the solution
[07:46:31] <varchar> awesome. cheers!
[07:54:34] <darkfrog> Is anyone here familiar with problems using jQuery AJAX on Firefox in Windows 8?
[07:55:12] <darkfrog> It's very strange, it says it sends the ajax call, but the server never receives it....works perfectly fine on Chrome and IE
[07:55:18] <darkfrog> ...and even Firefox on Ubuntu.
[08:00:14] <darkfrog> interesting....I decided to try removing all of my add-ons and somehow that fixed it....apparently I had a rogue add-on that was screwing up AJAX support.
[08:30:45] <kavi> track slider doesn’t move the playpoint to where the slider is in jplayer
[08:30:51] <kavi> any idea ??
[08:32:25] <cjohnson> not sure what either of those things is kavi but you most certainly are going to need to provide a jsfiddle and more details
[08:32:37] <cjohnson> your question as it is is rather useless :P
[08:36:48] <pantsofchocolate> hey handsome fellows quick question, anyone know a good package for showing bar and pie charts? i am trying chart.js and its giving me lots of shit
[08:40:29] <Velveeta> pantsofchocolate: we use highcharts, but it's not free
[08:41:03] <pantsofchocolate> ah jerks, ill check it out thanks
[08:41:26] <cjohnson> "giving me lots of shit" what a useful technical description
[08:41:46] <pantsofchocolate> its a programming term.
[08:42:27] <pantsofchocolate> it has trouble loading for me,Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <  is mostly what i get, the code isnt even really js its mostly html inside its strange
[08:43:00] <cjohnson> probably user error
[08:43:05] <cjohnson> you could paste your code
[08:43:14] <cjohnson> unexpected token < probably means you put html in the wrong place
[08:43:45] <pantsofchocolate> http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/ this is the guide im following, and just doing the initial steps doesnt work for me
[08:45:15] <cjohnson> no, paste *your* code
[08:45:57] <pantsofchocolate> thats what my code is, is that tutorial the first part where its just an html page, im running this all through django
[08:46:24] <pantsofchocolate> http://pastebin.com/BUs7sevg
[08:46:40] <cjohnson> where are you getting the error from
[08:46:51] <pantsofchocolate> when i look in the console of chrome
[08:47:02] <pantsofchocolate> it has a problem with the source of chart.min.js
[08:47:07] <cjohnson> click the error
[08:47:12] <cjohnson> it should take you to the source of chart.min.js
[08:47:17] <pantsofchocolate> <!DOCTYPE html>
[08:47:19] <pantsofchocolate> that line
[08:47:20] <cjohnson> I bet you copied the file in the wrong place and your reference is bad
[08:47:23] <pantsofchocolate> is at the top
[08:47:28] <cjohnson> chart.min.js does not contain <!DOCTYPE html>
[08:47:38] <cjohnson> I bet your server is responding with a 404 for chart.min.js
[08:47:48] <cjohnson> and your reference is incorrect
[08:48:16] <pantsofchocolate> that might make it more reasonable i was wondering why there is html in ht min
[08:51:34] <MikeD_> I have a list that's 5 items long and takes up 90px, when something is chosen, I give that list 55px to make room for an input and button.  if the last item was chosen, it gets obscured (you'll have to scroll to see it)  Is there a simple way to "scroll the overflow so the selected item is visible" ?
[08:52:24] <cjohnson> MikeD_: use $.scrollTo
[08:52:53] <cjohnson> I think it will scroll the overflow div as well
[08:53:18] <MikeD_> thanks
[08:53:50] <cjohnson> MikeD_: ah, actually you want $(node).animate: http://jsfiddle.net/subhash9/bLcnx/11/
[08:56:38] <farn5w0rth> how do i load a url into a tooltip? i have an angularjs app thats basically a dynamic url list that i want to appear in a tooltip...
[08:57:03] <robertmaxrees> dunno what all angular has to offer, but you could ajax the content on.
[08:57:06] <robertmaxrees> or use iframes.
[08:58:01] <farn5w0rth> robbyoconnor: how would i do either of those? where would i use the $().load(url)?
[08:58:09] <robertmaxrees> wrong username ;)
[08:58:17] <farn5w0rth> lol
[08:58:18] <robertmaxrees> and it depends on which tooltip you're using and what it expects.
[08:59:18] <cjohnson> If you're using jqueryui tooltip, you can pass a callback as the content option: http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[08:59:34] <cjohnson> oh...that might be tricky though
[08:59:44] <cjohnson> since ajax would be async
[08:59:56] <robertmaxrees> aye - really depends on the use case.
[08:59:57] <farn5w0rth> cjohnson: oo..well im juast using bootstrap css tooltip
[09:00:19] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to setup the load in a click binding/.
[09:01:03] <farn5w0rth> robertmaxrees: yea i set that up but i dont know how to push it into the data-attribute for the tooltip
[09:01:17] <cjohnson> I don't think that will work farn5w0rth
[09:01:22] <robertmaxrees> .data('theAttribute', content)
[09:01:26] <cjohnson> iirc the bootstrap tooltip plugin won't re-read data attribute changes
[09:01:29] <robertmaxrees> sure it'll work, it's just not a good idea.
[09:01:45] <robertmaxrees> you need to manually build and trigger the tooltips instead.
[09:02:02] <cjohnson> indeedy, check out trigger=manual
[09:02:05] <cjohnson> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips
[09:03:16] <farn5w0rth> hmm ok let me try binding to a click event and passing into the data attribute
[09:03:23] <robertmaxrees> don't do that btw.
[09:03:31] <farn5w0rth> robertmaxrees: lol
[09:03:33] <robertmaxrees> how much html are you planning on using?
[09:03:35] <robertmaxrees> and entire page?
[09:03:38] <robertmaxrees> or just a small fragment?
[09:03:51] <farn5w0rth> not much
[09:04:06] <farn5w0rth> its meant to be for a small link list
[09:04:08] <cjohnson> I just briefly checked and modifying the data attribute didn't appear to change the tooltip
[09:04:12] <robertmaxrees> so you're not including the doctype and stuff in the returned markup?
[09:05:05] <farn5w0rth> no its just loading an angular app so its basically bundles js/html
[09:05:32] <robertmaxrees> okay - i'd build out the individual tooltips separately and hide/show them manually, instead of swapping out the data.
[09:05:46] <cjohnson> farn5w0rth: on click, load the ajax, then generate the tooltip from the ajax success, and then $(elem).tooltip('show')
[09:06:01] <robertmaxrees> err.
[09:06:08] <robertmaxrees> that's going to cause the user to wait to see something.
[09:06:22] <robertmaxrees> show the tooltip immediately with a spinner, then replace the content when ajax foinishes.
[09:06:45] <farn5w0rth> ok ill use the ajax with loader that sounds reasonable
[09:06:48] <cjohnson> either way
[09:06:58] <cjohnson> the downside is you're going to lose the mouseoff trigger to hide so you'll have to re-add that too
[09:07:06] <cjohnson> and clicking on other elements of hte page
[09:07:20] <robertmaxrees> nah you use the same tooltip, just swap out the body.
[09:07:59] <Felishia> does someone know about some jquery competition?
[09:08:04] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Felishia
[09:08:04] <b-ot> Felishia: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:10:29] <cjohnson> robertmaxrees: I don't understand why you would hide/show the tooltips manually then, just leave the default tooltip trigger behavior in place?
[09:10:37] <cjohnson> and also use ajax to load teh body in place
[09:10:45] <cjohnson> I thought you were suggesting something else
[09:10:51] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[09:11:03] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you want to slice the problem up.
[09:14:06] <Felishia> I asked if someone knew about some sort of jquery competition
[09:14:45] <robertmaxrees> I read that as "completion", sorry.
[09:14:48] <robertmaxrees> "competition"?
[09:17:35] <P1RATEZ> You could write one if it doesn't exist... or make something similar to regex crossword
[09:18:05] <P1RATEZ> like that but use jq for selector challenges http://regexcrossword.com
[09:18:19] <robertmaxrees> Felishia could you clarify what you mean by that?
[09:18:55] <Felishia> I want to participate in a jQuery plugin competion, library, just something to get my name known...
[09:19:41] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?  are you looking for work or something else?
[09:20:06] <robertmaxrees> there are plenty of ways to contribute to the jquery project and become a valued member of the community, for instance.
[09:33:18] <CssNoob> any good slider other than this http://flexslider.woothemes.com/ ?
[09:34:00] <robertmaxrees> bxslider is a good one.
[09:34:14] <robertmaxrees> though i tend ot avoid sliders as much as humanly possible.
[09:34:20] <robertmaxrees> only ever found one good use case for them.
[09:38:31] <CssNoob> I'm practicing my Jquery skills that's why
[09:38:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:38:48] <robertmaxrees> that's a really strange reason to use a carousel.
[09:39:02] <CssNoob> Yeah
[09:39:14] <robertmaxrees> avoid them - they really are terrible.
[09:39:23] <CssNoob> i want to have a jquery function on my newbie site
[09:39:33] <CssNoob> just to know how to code jquery
[09:39:42] <robertmaxrees> you don't "code jquery".
[09:39:48] <robertmaxrees> you write javascript.  you can also use jquery to do it.
[09:39:50] <CssNoob> install
[09:40:25] <robertmaxrees> don't include a carousel just because.  find something actually useful to do :)
[09:40:40] <CssNoob> Fine, In somehow to learn that's why I put sliders
[09:40:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:40:59] <CssNoob> jquery--
[09:41:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused - why are you angry?
[09:41:13] <CssNoob> nope
[09:41:19] <CssNoob> LOL
[09:42:04] <CssNoob> Im not lol, any good jquery functions for a newbie coder for a newbie site?
[09:42:20] <robertmaxrees> depends on the site.
[09:42:35] <CssNoob> so a slider
[09:42:45] <robertmaxrees> carousels are a bad design concept.
[09:42:48] <robertmaxrees> avoid them when possible.
[09:43:02] <robertmaxrees> if you really think you need one, try writing one yourself for the experience.
[09:43:06] <CssNoob> hmm
[09:43:10] <robertmaxrees> but people basically ignore them.
[09:43:20] <robertmaxrees> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/ explains it pretty well.
[09:43:36] <CssNoob> I read that though but im just trying to learn jquery
[09:43:44] <CssNoob> and thats the basic ones the sliders
[09:43:56] <CssNoob> for now
[09:44:06] <CssNoob> and when im good at it no carousels
[09:44:10] <robertmaxrees> event binding is much simpler in my opinion.
[09:44:19] <robertmaxrees> do something with those instead.
[09:44:36] <robertmaxrees> get some fundamentals under your belt.
[09:44:47] <CssNoob> hmm
[09:45:00] <CssNoob> so sliders that it is really my own code?
[09:45:30] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't practice making a slider since they're not useful, but if you really feel the need to make one, write your own.
[09:45:39] <robertmaxrees> if the goal is to learn, challenge yourself/.
[09:45:48] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, find something your site actually needs and build that instead.
[09:46:13] <CssNoob> my site for my own though
[09:46:26] <CssNoob> my site is for my own learnings though
[09:46:35] <robertmaxrees> just pointing it out ;)
[09:46:38] <CssNoob> http://raineerdelarita.comuv.com/nerpets/#
[09:46:54] <CssNoob> that one, im having a problem with my slider
[09:47:14] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[09:47:21] <robertmaxrees> it'll tell you what the problem is.
[09:47:28] <CssNoob> lol i did
[09:47:59] <robertmaxrees> okay, then what?
[09:48:26] <CssNoob> someone told me it wont load
[09:48:29] <CssNoob> did it load?
[09:48:58] <cjohnson> loaded for me
[09:49:17] <CssNoob> is my sliders fine :|
[09:49:31] <CssNoob> ?
[09:52:27] <robertmaxrees> your slider is broken.
[09:52:33] <robertmaxrees> because of that typeerror
[09:52:54] <CssNoob> typeerror?
[09:53:03] <robertmaxrees> your console duder.
[09:53:09] <robertmaxrees> it tells you what's brojen.
[09:53:11] <robertmaxrees> *broken
[09:53:41] <CssNoob> hmm
[09:54:25] <robertmaxrees> you have 2 copies of jquery included on the page.
[09:55:51] <robertmaxrees> that's going to cause your issues.
[09:56:29] <CssNoob> http://raineerdelarita.comuv.com/test/
[09:56:41] <CssNoob> this one are no different
[09:56:42] <robertmaxrees> open your console again.
[09:56:46] <robertmaxrees> different error.
[09:56:47] <CssNoob> than that one
[09:56:50] <robertmaxrees> you're hacking around the issue.
[09:56:51] <CssNoob> it is the same slides
[09:57:03] <robertmaxrees> not the same way though
[09:57:20] <robertmaxrees> that second one is hacking past the problem.
[09:57:23] <CssNoob> no they are the same both plugin slides
[09:57:31] <robertmaxrees> but they are initialized at different places.
[09:57:35] <CssNoob> but it doesnt load right awau
[09:57:37] <robertmaxrees> with jquery included at different places.
[09:57:44] <CssNoob> but it doesnt load right away
[09:58:20] <robertmaxrees> the second one is as broken as the first, it just hides the error.
[09:58:31] <robertmaxrees> you're including jquery twice on each of these pages.
[09:58:44] <dodofren> Hello giys!
[09:58:49] <hxm> is "new formData" not supported for every browsers?
[09:58:51] <dodofren> *guys
[09:58:55] <CssNoob> :|
[09:59:15] <CssNoob> what do you mean twice?
[09:59:43] <robertmaxrees> there are two copies of jquery on those pages.
[09:59:56] <robertmaxrees> hxm i wouldn't use that constructor anyway.
[10:00:12] <CssNoob> two pages?
[10:00:13] <tharkun> I took the combobox from jqueryui.com looking for a look and feel like it. But if I import all the remote files from jqueryui.com to my local server the little triangle on the box gets lost. How is that triangle beeing rendered, AFAIK all the elements needed for that to work should be on my local server yet it fails. Any suggestions?
[10:00:19] <hxm> i want to send a form with an attached file trought ajax, how to do it then?
[10:00:28] <robertmaxrees> CssNoob both links you sent me have the same problem.
[10:00:34] <robertmaxrees> two copies of jquery on each of them
[10:01:07] <dodofren> I have a question or well two regarding jquery. Is it possible to insert a line break every 600px of height of a selected DOM node?
[10:01:21] <dodofren> or well any other length
[10:01:23] <CssNoob> what's the problem? I used it twice? robertmaxrees]
[10:01:45] <robertmaxrees> CssNoob that will cause errors, yeas.
[10:01:47] <robertmaxrees> *yes
[10:01:54] <robertmaxrees> lots of them.  use only one copy at a time.
[10:02:05] <robertmaxrees> dodofren it's possible, but a strange thing to want to do.
[10:02:20] <dodofren> i know..
[10:02:31] <dodofren> how would one approach that?
[10:03:12] <CssNoob>  I dont get it what do you mean I used it twice?
[10:04:00] <robertmaxrees> CssNoob http://i.imgur.com/8cIOKwV.png
[10:04:11] <robertmaxrees> there are two references to jquery on those pages.
[10:04:14] <robertmaxrees> that is causing errors.
[10:04:25] <robertmaxrees> dodofren mind explaining why you want to do that first?
[10:05:11] <robertmaxrees> hxm ah file uploads are a pain.  there are other ways to do it but they're all funky.
[10:05:28] <dodofren> Well I have a webservice that returns a long string of paragraphs and image tags
[10:05:30] <robertmaxrees> hxm https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[10:05:58] <dodofren> and the client wants to break it apart so it looks like a word document or something
[10:06:01] <hxm> will work in other webbrowsers too?
[10:06:09] <robertmaxrees> hxm look at the link i just shared.
[10:06:14] <robertmaxrees> it has a browser compatibility table.
[10:06:18] <hxm> ah thanks
[10:07:37] <dodofren> basically I would insert page footers and headers instead. As said clients request and it would look a bit nicer indeed :)
[10:07:53] <robertmaxrees> dodofren that's a really strange thing to want to do and kind of funky - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.elementFromPoint would help.
[10:07:58] <robertmaxrees> but i'd really avoid doing it at all.
[10:08:17] <robertmaxrees> web browsers are not microsoft word - that format doens't really make sense for the web.
[10:08:24] <dodofren> yeah I know
[10:08:50] <robertmaxrees> whoever is leading the design on that project should really protest the change, but meh.
[10:09:18] <dodofren> If I had any creative control over the project I would do it differently and this client is really a rock that wont budge no matter how you reason with it :D
[10:10:44] <tharkun> dodofren: I have the impression they want a printer friendly version of the document. It is just a hunch but worth asking the client.
[10:11:08] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[10:11:15] <robertmaxrees> if that's what they want, you need a different solution entirely.
[10:11:24] <dodofren> tharkun - that's the first thing I asked but I was assured he wants that as a standard view
[10:11:40] <dodofren> I guess he's too used to notification on his phone app :D
[10:12:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd fire that client personally, but i don't do freelance on purpose soooo
[10:16:21] <dodofren> well it's good moneyand he pays on time :D
[10:16:35] <dodofren> Thank you both for advice and your time!
[10:22:40] <Prometheian> The site I'm working on has a page where a button is constructed in the backend, and its onClick event is set to a method that opens a window. When the window opens the page that the button is on refreshes. Is there a way to catch when the opened window closes and refresh the page again?
[10:23:24] <robertmaxrees> is it actually a new window?  if not, could you change it to a modal?
[10:24:13] <robertmaxrees> also: is the new window on the same domain, port, and protocol as the window taht opened it?
[10:25:03] <Prometheian> It is a new window, modal might be an option but I would really prefer to keep the window. This is a legacy application and changing too much could have unexpected consequences. :/ Also, it's same domain, popup window is just a video.
[10:25:25] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/9388451/923919
[10:26:09] <Prometheian> I've tried that, and I'll give it another shot, but I think because the page refreshes when the button is clicked it loses the method.
[10:26:25] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah that reference will break...
[10:26:32] <robertmaxrees> because you don't have the context any more.
[10:26:44] <Prometheian> Yeah :/
[10:26:55] <robertmaxrees> there's no real way around that tbh
[10:27:24] <Prometheian> kk, I know there's gonna be some way to do it in the backend which will be ugly, but beggars can't be choosers
[10:27:50] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to send stuff to your backend via ajax or something else.
[10:28:29] <Prometheian> There's something getting sent, the video sends back some kind of course completion data, but I've had trouble finding when/where.
[10:28:42] <robertmaxrees> open your network panel and see what's up.
[10:28:51] <Prometheian> good idea
[10:28:58] <stikkemz> i usually work with ajax/php sessions/cookies to keep data over refresh
[10:29:04] <stikkemz> look into that
[10:29:18] <robertmaxrees> depending on what the legacy system looks like, he may not be able to easily accommodate that.
[10:29:49] <robertmaxrees> also: sessions aren't exclusive to PHP ;)
[10:30:15] <Prometheian> If I was building this site from scratch there's no doubt I'd ensure something like that, but the damn things so oddly setup it's just a bitch. There are other course-types that refresh the page on close, but I've looked at the code and can't spot a difference, at least on the surface.
[10:30:33] <robertmaxrees> those are the best
[10:30:42] <Prometheian> Yop >>'
[10:30:58] <stikkemz> robertmaxrees: i noe that, but i love working in php when it comes to sessions because it`s easy to implement and reliable
[10:31:02] <cjohnson> can a child window send commands to the parent?
[10:31:15] <cjohnson> window.opener
[10:31:18] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson "kind of", but if the parent refreshes, you're SOL
[10:31:36] <robertmaxrees> stikkemz i dislike PHP personally, but to each their own.
[10:31:37] <Prometheian> Not without the main window's context getting passed around, the refresh fucks that :/
[10:33:13] <cjohnson> I'm not sure the refresh kills window.opener
[10:33:20] <stikkemz> robertmaxrees: what do you use to handle sessions? personal curiosity
[10:33:23] <cjohnson> I just tested and I refreshed and window.opener was still able to call functions on the parent window
[10:33:30] <cjohnson> refreshed the parent*
[10:33:38] <robertmaxrees> stikkemz at my current place i don't have a choice.
[10:33:58] <Prometheian> cjohnson: fiddle?
[10:34:28] <robertmaxrees> stikkemz at my current place, we're using coldfusion for the frontend and a beskpoke session management system written in java with redis in the back.
[10:34:33] <robertmaxrees> we have some... funky considerations to handle.
[10:34:51] <cjohnson> I just ran it in the console. var win = window.open('#'); function herp(){alert('herp');} and in the child window's console I ran window.opener.herp();
[10:34:54] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[10:35:01] <cjohnson> then I refreshed the window, redefined the function, and called it again
[10:35:19] <stikkemz> robertmaxrees: oh man, is it reliable?
[10:35:20] <robertmaxrees> as long as IE doesn't treat it with a different security zone you should be fine.
[10:35:23] <robertmaxrees> stikkemz very
[10:35:45] <robertmaxrees> stikkemz have only ever seen one bug with sessions, and it's very unlikely it's because of our system.
[10:36:11] <stikkemz> robertmaxrees: cool, i`ll look into it if i ever need to ditch php for some reason.. thx
[10:36:23] <robertmaxrees> stikkemz just don't use coldfusion.  for anything.
[10:36:29] <cjohnson> seconded
[10:36:34] <robertmaxrees> i hate working with it.
[10:36:44] <cjohnson> was that a macromedia product?
[10:36:48] <stikkemz> robertmaxrees: that`s actually why i asked it it`s reliable :)))
[10:36:48] <robertmaxrees> originally yeah.
[10:36:51] <robertmaxrees> it's still well supported.
[10:36:56] <cjohnson> I can't think of anything they ever made that I have enjoyed
[10:37:20] <robertmaxrees> cfscript makes things a little less terrible, and using java to handle your business logic lets you turn it into more of a templating language, which it's OK at doing.
[10:38:11] <stikkemz> i`m not a huge fan of java tho, i rather python if it comes to OS programming stuff
[10:38:16] <robertmaxrees> stikkemz our system isn't reliable because of the CF part - it's reliable because our backend developers know what they're doing.
[10:38:32] <Prometheian> cjohnson: Can you double check that for window closing?
[10:38:41] <robertmaxrees> i like node personally, and we're using that for our new frontend, but we'll always have to support CF in some capacity
[10:38:52] <cjohnson> Prometheian: what do you mean?
[10:39:05] <robertmaxrees> python is interesting, too.  but i don't get to call all of the shots.
[10:39:13] <Prometheian> Refresh the main page, close the popup, see if main page is refreshed.
[10:39:20] <cjohnson> why would the main page be refreshed?
[10:39:38] <Prometheian> Intent of what I'm trying to do
[10:39:44] <stikkemz> robertmaxrees: you can do things so god damn fast in py.. it`s incredible!
[10:39:50] <robertmaxrees> i know.
[10:39:51] <cjohnson> you'll have to provide more details Prometheian
[10:39:58] <cjohnson> the main window isn't jus tgoing to automatically refresh...
[10:40:01] <robertmaxrees> each language has things it's good at.
[10:40:07] <stikkemz> true
[10:40:10] <Prometheian> I need to make it refresh when popup closes
[10:40:14] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson their original problem was that opening the popup refreshes the window.
[10:40:22] <robertmaxrees> they then want it to refresh again when the popup closes.
[10:40:26] <robertmaxrees> am i right, Prometheian?
[10:40:30] <Prometheian> yes
[10:40:35] <stikkemz> robertmaxrees: well again, thanks for the info mate.. really appreciate it
[10:40:39] <robertmaxrees> stikkemz deffo
[10:40:48] <cjohnson> on the main page, make a function which refreshes. on the child window, onbeforeunload, call window.opener.theRefreshFunction()
[10:42:07] <Prometheian> newwin.onclose(function() { window.opener.refresh() });
[10:42:14] <Prometheian> How's that look?
[10:42:23] <robertmaxrees> onBeforeUnload probably.
[10:42:31] <ngharo> window.opener.location.reload() would be a native method
[10:42:48] <Prometheian> onBeforeUnload or onbeforeunload?
[10:42:54] <Prometheian> and I'll try that robert!
[10:43:15] <cjohnson> oh I didn't know you could call window.location, I guess that makes sense
[10:43:30] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WindowEventHandlers.onbeforeunload
[10:43:58] <Prometheian> No caps, got it :)
[10:44:03] <cjohnson> window.onbeforeunload = function() { window.opener.location.reload(); };  on the child window works here
[10:44:51] <Prometheian> newwin = window.open(url)
[10:44:57] <Prometheian> newwin.onbeforeunload(function() { window.opener.location.reload(); });
[10:45:11] <cjohnson> I don't think it's a function
[10:45:22] <Prometheian> location reload?
[10:45:27] <cjohnson> onbeforeunload
[10:45:29] <cjohnson> look at my example
[10:45:40] <Prometheian> ah
[10:45:41] <Prometheian> hmm
[10:45:44] <Prometheian> that might explain a lot
[10:45:49] <cjohnson> reading usually helps ;)
[10:45:57] <robertmaxrees> window.onbeforeunload = window.opener.location.reload;
[10:46:06] <cjohnson> oh haha derp better still
[10:46:09] * cjohnson brain farts
[10:46:16] <Prometheian> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_loc_reload.asp
[10:46:19] <Prometheian> reload is a function?
[10:46:19] <robertmaxrees> the function reference, not he function itself.
[10:46:29] <robertmaxrees> noooo w3schools :(
[10:46:41] <robertmaxrees> window.onbeforeunload = window.opener.location.reload; is what you want.
[10:46:44] <stikkemz> lel
[10:46:54] <robertmaxrees> onbeforeonload takes a function reference, not the function itself.
[10:47:24] <robertmaxrees> if you slap parens after that, you're going to run the function immediately to get the returned value, which is not what you want in this case.
[10:47:38] <robertmaxrees> you want the reference to the function object, which onbeforeunload will then call for you.
[10:48:00] <cjohnson> you could use newwin in place of window if you're doing this from the parent
[10:48:04] <cjohnson> (the first window)
[10:48:31] <Prometheian> Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[10:48:39] <Prometheian> trying to get it to show me the code
[10:48:47] <Prometheian> but this app likes to compile everything terribly
[10:49:19] <cjohnson> PEBKAC
[10:49:45] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/smfom6h6/
[10:49:52] <robertmaxrees> you're probably appending () where you shouldn't.
[10:50:52] <Prometheian> looking around
[10:52:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/smfom6h6/1/ with comments.
[10:53:51] <Prometheian> kinda get it
[10:54:12] <robertmaxrees> that's why you pass the function name without the parens
[10:55:55] <Prometheian> So passing in func() executes the function prior to passing it?
[10:56:07] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:56:17] <Prometheian> So why don't I see two foo's?
[10:56:19] <robertmaxrees> it evaluates and sends the result of the function as the argument
[10:56:25] <robertmaxrees> look at your console ;)
[10:56:35] <robertmaxrees> the second one errors out because you can't do "foo"()
[10:56:49] <Prometheian> Ah
[10:56:50] <robertmaxrees> that's literally what it's trying to do under the hood - call a string as a function.
[10:56:55] <Prometheian> Thought it was erroring on bar :P
[10:57:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:00:59] <ServerSage> Lets say I have foo.somefunc = function() { alert('test') } and then I have a variable var bar = 'foo';.  Is there a way that I can call somefunc using the variable bar?  Like bar.somefunc()?
[11:01:21] <cjohnson> .call and .apply
[11:01:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:01:40] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you need to use a constructor function to craft objkects that inherit
[11:02:51] <ServerSage> Interesting, thanks!
[11:03:48] <robertmaxrees> or .bind(), depending on what you're doing/.
[11:08:29] <bbclover> hey guys if I have var main = function() {}; and I want to call this when the document is ready, can't I simply $(main);? or must I $(document).ready(main)? is there any shorthand?
[11:09:11] <Prometheian> $(function() {main()})
[11:09:37] <duch_kazatel> you could also just do $(main)
[11:09:59] <bbclover> nice
[11:12:42] <ServerSage> Hmmm, maybe I'm mental, but I don't think .call or .apply is exactly what I'm looking for. here is a small example of what I want:  http://jsfiddle.net/chg749t9/
[11:13:19] <robertmaxrees> ServerSage you cannot call somefunc on an object it doesn't belong to like that.
[11:13:32] <robertmaxrees> you could do foo.somefunc.call(bar)
[11:13:48] <robertmaxrees> or you need to create a constructor that spits out object that inherit that method.
[11:14:31] <robertmaxrees> foo.somefunc.call(bar, 'first argument in function')
[11:15:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm not a fan of constructors personally, and i don't see the value in the pattern you're using now.
[11:15:48] <robertmaxrees> well, of writing my own constructors i mean.
[11:16:55] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:18:28] <cjohnson> ServerSage: can you provide a more real example of what you' retrying to accomplish?
[11:18:38] <cjohnson> your foo/bar variables are confusing your goal for me
[11:20:56] <CssNoob> robertmaxrees
[11:21:22] <CssNoob> from my slides, but you can see them working right?
[11:21:37] <CssNoob> http://raineerdelarita.comuv.com/nerpets/#
[11:29:05] <cjohnson> CssNoob: your slider at the top works fine for me, chrome OS X
[11:29:59] <CssNoob> cjohnson would you mine posting a screenshot please
[11:30:49] <robertmaxrees> yep that works.
[11:31:09] <robertmaxrees> hard refresh it, CssNoob
[11:31:14] <CssNoob> hmm
[11:32:07] <CssNoob> Yeah, but some guys told me it isn't working
[11:33:04] <CssNoob> robertmaxrees could you send me a screenshot please?
[11:33:06] <cjohnson> punch them in the nose
[11:33:23] <CssNoob> http://raineerdelarita.comuv.com/nerpets/#
[11:33:28] <robertmaxrees> they need clear their cache
[11:34:02] <CssNoob> i.imgur.com/i54m9Hj.jp
[11:34:10] <robertmaxrees> CssNoob does it work for you?
[11:34:17] <CssNoob> Yeah
[11:34:46] <robertmaxrees> then tel them to clear their cache
[11:34:49] <robertmaxrees> *tell
[11:34:57] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't fix it, there's a mitigating factor
[11:35:55] <CssNoob> http://i.imgur.com/i54m9Hj.jpg
[11:36:08] <robertmaxrees> i saw that already yo
[11:36:24] <robertmaxrees> don't show me - show your client ;)
[11:36:47] <CssNoob> the sad part is i got no client
[11:36:50] <robertmaxrees> with your site that you're building for yourself and for learning purposes.
[11:37:03] <robertmaxrees> then who isn't it working for?
[11:37:36] <CssNoob> self study
[11:37:47] <CssNoob> like portfolio
[11:37:57] <CssNoob> fake template to get a job
[11:38:05] <CssNoob> or not :|
[11:38:07] <robertmaxrees> then don't use a carousel ;)
[11:38:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:38:39] <CssNoob> i need to know jQuery
[11:38:47] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - start with learn.jquery.com
[11:39:17] <robertmaxrees> don't learn jquery through things you should avoid using.
[11:39:18] <CssNoob> http://flexslider.woothemes.com/
[11:39:22] <robertmaxrees> that was my entire point earlier.
[11:39:33] <CssNoob> im using that plugin
[11:39:33] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how to differently phrase that.
[11:39:53] <CssNoob> i mean jquery
[11:40:55] <robertmaxrees> don't use a tool for the sake of using the tool.  people want holes, not drills.
[11:41:21] <robertmaxrees> learn to use the tool and them apply it as needed.
[11:41:42] <cjohnson> "people want holes, not drills"
[11:41:44] <cjohnson> I like that
[11:42:01] <robertmaxrees> from this article: http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/02/founder-stories-people-dont-want-drills/
[11:42:08] <CssNoob> thanks robertmaxrees
[11:48:34] <kingbeowolf> can some one help me with a scrolling text problem?
[11:48:36] <kingbeowolf> http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/L5o9kqov/
[11:48:47] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question.
[11:49:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[11:50:01] <cjohnson> dance the night away
[11:50:03] <cjohnson> oh, not me
[11:50:17] <robertmaxrees> lololol
[11:50:59] <kingbeowolf> robertmaxrees trying to just have a marquee scrolling upwards
[11:51:09] <cj> is it possible to pass arbitrary data to an $.ajax complete handler function?
[11:51:30] <kingbeowolf> trying to also control the spacing between the first and last sentence after it repeats as well
[11:51:34] <cj> where those data are specified during the call to $.ajax()
[11:51:36] <cjohnson> you can define a variable outside the handler that the handler then reads
[11:51:37] <robertmaxrees> cj using .call(), .apply(), or .bind(), sure
[11:51:40] <kingbeowolf> trying to have very little spacing
[11:52:06] <cj> robertmaxrees: could I bother you for an example?
[11:52:37] <robertmaxrees> cj go check out the MDN docs and let me know if you're still confused :) i'd need to see your code and what you're actually trying to do
[11:52:53] <cj> robertmaxrees: yeah, I've read through those...
[11:52:54] <cj> $.ajax( options.searchUrl(), { complete: options.rhandler } );
[11:53:00] <robertmaxrees> kingbeowolf hold up - so for starters you just want a scrolling area automatically?
[11:53:10] <cj> I want to pass the options object to the options.rhandler function somehow
[11:53:23] <robertmaxrees> could you make a fixee showing the code?
[11:53:34] <cjohnson> you read the entire MDN docs? wow
[11:53:45] <robertmaxrees> heh cjohnson you know what he meant ;)
[11:54:05] <robertmaxrees> cj you can do options.rhandler.bind(this, arg1, arg2, arg3)
[11:54:17] <kingbeowolf> robertmaxrees yeah
[11:54:29] <robertmaxrees> though you'll have to be careful with how the args are passed to that function.
[11:54:39] <robertmaxrees> kingbeowolf then you're overcomplicating this quite a big.
[11:54:42] <robertmaxrees> *quite a bit
[11:55:00] <cj> robertmaxrees: hmmm... this function might be called by multiple sources.  I don't want those arguments passed for every call, just for this one
[11:55:14] <cjohnson> that's correct
[11:55:21] <robertmaxrees> cj huh?  a fixee would be helpful in this case.
[11:55:32] <cj> I was thinking that the object could be crammed in to the jqXHR object somehow
[11:55:41] <kingbeowolf> robertmaxrees how can I do it better then?
[11:55:52] <cj> robertmaxrees: sure, let me actually just scp it somewhere you can look at it
[11:56:05] <robertmaxrees> kingbeowolf first off - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L5o9kqov/2/
[11:56:15] <robertmaxrees> that's for the scrollbar area.
[11:56:41] <cjohnson> cj: jsfiddle or the like, please ;)
[11:56:45] <kingbeowolf> robertmaxrees yeah i dont want the scrollbar i want it to scroll
[11:56:56] <robertmaxrees> kingbeowolf that's fine - we can change that pretty easily.
[11:59:02] <kingbeowolf> robertmaxrees any other ideas on how to make it scrolling like marquee?
[11:59:07] <robertmaxrees> kingbeowolf http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L5o9kqov/3/
[11:59:27] <kingbeowolf> that was easy
[11:59:27] <robertmaxrees> if you want the repeated effect, you'll have to build in your appending logic, but what you had before was overcomplicating it.
[11:59:56] <cj> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/vqco7L76/#&togetherjs=G2SnfyVtb2
[12:00:12] <cj> so, I've got two functions that do pretty much the same thing
[12:00:15] <robertmaxrees> which function in here?
[12:00:31] <robertmaxrees> you have a lot of functions doing pretty much the same thing ;)
[12:00:33] <cj> except that they operate on different elements and store their state in different object fields
[12:00:58] <cj> searchContinuousLoadFunction and homeContinuousLoadFunction
[12:01:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you want to use .bind() when you call it.
[12:01:35] <robertmaxrees> wait .call() i think actually.
[12:01:38] <robertmaxrees> handler: p.searchContinuousLoadFunction, right?
[12:01:57] <cj> so look at the continuousLoadFunction, which is the generic one called with an object specifying the differences
[12:02:07] <cj> line 51 is the ajax call
[12:02:16] <cj> the callback is specified in options.rhandler
[12:02:18] <robertmaxrees> complete: options.rhandler this guy?
[12:02:32] <cj> this is either p.xhrSearchResponseHandler or p.xhrHomeResponseHandler
[12:02:40] <cj> yeah, that one
[12:02:50] <robertmaxrees> yep - .bind()
[12:03:10] <cj> alright, I'll look at that function more closely.  danke!
[12:03:31] <robertmaxrees> kingbeowolf did you see the basic fiddle i gave you?
[12:09:48] <kevin> hey guys. so am doing something like $("<option/>").val(...).text(...).appendTo(selector) ... is this valid if `selector' returns multiple elements? or do i need to first create the <option/> , then add a clone to each element matched with `selector' ?
[12:10:37] <cj> robertmaxrees: okay, what event should I bind to, and on what object?  I'm confused as to how .bind() will help here
[12:11:04] <robertmaxrees> kevin check out the docs for appendTo() it'd tell you :)
[12:11:09] <robertmaxrees> cj not jquery bind
[12:11:11] <robertmaxrees> javascript bind
[12:11:20] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[12:11:22] <cj> kevin: IIRC, appendTo() will do it for each element matched.
[12:11:26] <cj> thanks, robertmaxrees
[12:11:58] <robertmaxrees> kevin http://api.jquery.com/appendto/ will tell you which elements it'
[12:12:02] <robertmaxrees> *it'll work against.
[12:12:10] <kevin> ah i see it
[12:12:11] <kevin> thanks
[12:17:13] <matthewk> how do i call a selector on a div in memory $div ? i would like to get all the 'img' within $div
[12:20:27] <cj> $('selector').children('another,selector')
[12:20:42] <decx> $div.find('img')
[12:20:46] <cj> or that
[12:24:12] <matthewk> thanks
[12:28:44] <Prometheian> If I call this.onbeforeunload() it calls the correct method, but if I hit the X it just closes and doesn't seem to fire. Any idea why? :/
[12:51:38] <bbclover> do you guys make your functions all inside a document ready or just write functions like normal javascript and then call them with document ready?
[12:51:46] <Furby> this http://raw.pro-chan.com/Raw/t/674_1382207920
[12:54:12] <cjohnson> bbclover: the latter
[12:54:27] <cjohnson> bbclover: you only want to put inside $(document).ready() what actually depends on the document being ready
[12:54:38] <bbclover> I have no idea
[12:54:38] <cjohnson> anything else just slows things down
[12:54:49] <cjohnson> it's pretty easy to tell
[12:55:07] <cjohnson> does the thing manipulate the DOM? probably needs document.ready
[12:55:14] <cjohnson> if not, probably doesn't belong in document.ready
[12:55:19] <bbclover> so a button on a page being clicked, why would this need a document ready?
[12:55:22] <bbclover> it's already there
[12:55:29] <cjohnson> it may not be
[12:55:33] <cjohnson> if the JS it put in the <head>
[12:55:37] <bbclover> well then you can't click it
[12:55:48] <cjohnson> it would execute immediately, before the <body> had even been loaded
[12:56:01] <bbclover> ohhh
[12:56:07] <bbclover> so I see script tags being at the bottom of the body
[12:56:10] <bbclover> is this not a way around it?
[12:56:13] <cjohnson> so it waits until the <body> is loaded before binding events to the nodes
[12:56:28] <cjohnson> that is a way around it, but it's more portable if you use document.ready
[12:56:38] <cjohnson> then people can put your script tag wherever they want and it won't break your script
[12:56:39] <bbclover> I see
[12:56:53] <bbclover> oh yes, I understand
[12:58:12] <cjohnson> people tend to just wrap everything in a $(document).ready, it's not the end of the world, and is generally a safe thing to do. Once the document is ready, any call to $(document).ready() fires instantly
[12:58:38] <cjohnson> but if you're writing code, I would define functions and prototypes and such outside if you can help it
[12:58:56] <bbclover> o man prototypes
[13:25:02] <Bhigum> guys if I have for example this :: var = {1,2,3,4,5}: how can I to do for convert them into 5 vars?
[13:25:14] <Bhigum> I think split doesn't works for me
[13:25:39] <cjohnson> what are you trying to accomplish?
[13:26:10] <Bhigum> to divide that array in eachone elements inside
[13:26:38] <cjohnson> for which purchase
[13:26:40] <cjohnson> purpose**
[13:26:59] <cjohnson> you can't just spit 5 variables into the atmosphere without naming them
[13:27:10] <cjohnson> but maybe we can help you figure out what you're trying to do
[13:27:22] <bbclover> hey guys so in a function all variables with the name var are local scope right? function scope? i.e. private?
[13:28:31] <cjohnson> it's not exactly private
[13:29:54] <Bhigum> In my db I have stored a field with info like :: 23,45,75,79
[13:30:02] <toothe> so, I just spent a few days learning vanilla JS to get prepped up for jQuery.
[13:30:09] <Bhigum> each one data of that I need to show separatelly
[13:30:16] <toothe> "learning", more like going through W3Schools and trying a bunch of examples.
[13:30:36] <cjohnson> bbclover: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var
[13:30:41] <toothe> I'm surprised that in this simple example, my <td> isn't hiding: http://dpaste.com/03XJ745
[13:30:58] <cjohnson> Bhigum: provide some demo code please
[13:31:00] <toothe> I just do $("#hideMe").hide(); but it doesn't hide. Am I doing something wrong?
[13:31:09] <cjohnson> Bhigum: {1,2,3,4} is invalid javascript (I think?)
[13:31:24] <cjohnson> it's not what you think it is, anyway
[13:31:56] <decx> there are several mistakes toothe
[13:31:56] <cjohnson> toothe: first, you can't put JS inside a <script> tag with a src on it, I don't believe
[13:32:02] <cjohnson> you also need type="text/javascript"
[13:32:06] <decx> first mistake was using w3schools
[13:32:16] <decx> cjohnson that's optional
[13:32:20] <decx> but yes separate the tags
[13:32:21] <cjohnson> and your code is executing in the <head>, which is before the <body> exists, thus no button exists when you fire it
[13:32:25] <toothe> cjohnson: Google does it.
[13:32:38] <cjohnson> are you sure they don't just use 2 tags?
[13:32:43] <toothe> let me make that correction.
[13:32:45] <decx> #hideMe doesnt exist yet when you do that
[13:32:47] <toothe> i jsut checked...let me re-vierfy
[13:32:54] <toothe> ohhhhh decx its probably that.
[13:33:01] <toothe> see, that's something that kinda annoys me....
[13:33:16] <cjohnson> put your scripts before </body> is one way to fix that
[13:33:16] <decx> $(function(){ mycode });
[13:33:23] <cjohnson> or bind to $(document).ready()
[13:33:28] <cjohnson> $(function) is an alias to that
[13:33:28] <toothe> yeah, I'm just doing a simple example.
[13:34:52] <toothe> I think its the separate script issue
[13:34:58] <toothe> which strikes me as odd.
[13:36:51] <toothe> this is a snippet from gmail: http://dpaste.com/1RHCVAP
[13:37:06] <toothe> to me, it seems that they put code within their <script> tag.
[13:37:14] <cjohnson> there's no src
[13:37:20] <cjohnson> that's fine, it should be in a <script> tag
[13:37:22] <toothe> ahh....
[13:37:27] <cjohnson> but you can't load jquery.js AND run some js in the same tag
[13:37:35] <toothe> i see...
[13:37:51] <toothe> I also need to visit the section in the material I read about loading the actual JS after the page renders, rather than ASAP
[13:38:00] <toothe> that way, I don't have to place my code at the end of the page.
[13:38:28] <cjohnson> $(function() { ... });
[13:38:41] <cjohnson> anything in that function won't run until the document is ready (meaning the <body> has been parsed and loaded
[13:38:50] <toothe> i see....
[13:40:24] <toothe> I learned HTML when I was in 6th grade...
[13:40:35] <toothe> it never ceases to amaze me all the amazing updates and features.
[13:40:40] <toothe> especially "Web 2.0"
[13:54:47] <Bhigum> cjohnson : http://jsfiddle.net/t95kqnbk/
[13:54:51] <Bhigum> is this
[13:55:11] <Bhigum> but now I to put one $.each() function inside the $.pnotify({})
[13:55:14] <Bhigum> how can I get it
[14:09:02] <toothe> hm...my tr hider and shower isn't hiding...
[14:09:06] <toothe> or rather, unhiding.
[14:10:24] <toothe> http://dpaste.com/0JHW1F7
[14:10:27] <Blaster> How could I have a Read more button after so many characters of text, and then show the remaining text when clicked?
[14:10:37] <toothe> so, its supposed to just hide, then unhide. I thought it was pretety simple.
[14:10:45] <toothe> change the attr, then change it back.
[14:12:45] <toothe> to me, this seems quite simple - hide, then show bychanging the onclick attr.
[14:23:26] <toothe> yah, I'm stuck.
[14:25:54] <toothe> I can't figureout what's wrong with this: http://dpaste.com/0YGTMB1
[14:26:06] <toothe> the error is that onclick and shower() are not defined.
[14:28:35] <dipser> $(tag).attr()
[14:28:41] <cjohnson> toothe: firstly, you don't just put code inside of strings
[14:28:54] <cjohnson> you also don't bind events via setAttribute or attr
[14:29:47] <cjohnson> you probably also want to just combine those into one function with an if/else
[14:29:54] <cjohnson> to determine whether it should show or hide
[14:30:19] <cjohnson> you can use if ($(tag).is(':hidden')) {
[14:30:22] <cjohnson> to see if it's already hidden
[14:31:18] <toothe> int his case, I will have several dozen, potentially 300+ divs
[14:31:21] <cjohnson> and don't use the html attributes onclick, bind the handler to the events initially the same way you are trying to bind them in your functions, up in the javascript
[14:31:29] <toothe> so, I woudln't use a single variable.
[14:31:30] <cjohnson> doesn't matter, same advice applies
[14:31:36] <cjohnson> no variable involved
[14:31:40] <cjohnson> read what I wrote ;)
[14:32:05] <cjohnson> and with that, I'm off
[14:32:17] <toothe> thank you...will try
[14:32:21] <toothe> i have to go home and cut chicken, bbl
[15:22:18] <b-lew> is there a reason why this isn't working in IE8

[15:23:17] <hactor> It's kind of annoying jQuery has a method for everything I'd do manually, even stuff like .closest() .last() and .first()
[15:27:11] <BillCriswell> hactor: Why is that annoying?
[15:30:26] <shoky> finally, a good argument against jquery
[15:30:34] <hactor> shoky, yeah!
[15:31:33] <Robdgreat> "it doesn't make me write enough code"
[15:31:36] <Robdgreat> I'm sold
[15:31:41] <Robdgreat> Abolish jquery!
[15:31:41] <hactor> BillCriswell, well it's kinda annoying. Because you can't address all possible cases like this, yet they tried. It's also annoying because I feels obsessive compulsive about going back to the code I just wrote yesterday and replacing a loop I wrote manually with .closest() and stuff.
[15:32:16] <hactor> Down with helper functions, they're taking eerr jeeebs.
[15:33:02] <BillCriswell> I'm not following at all.
[15:33:05] <BillCriswell> but it's ok.
[15:33:12] <BillCriswell> I think I just need sleep.
[15:33:24] <hactor> BillCriswell, oh I need sleep too.
[15:33:30] <hactor> But I have none. :P
[15:33:33] <shoky> let's all sleep
[15:34:04] <hactor> jQuery is also annoying because it executes scripts when you assign them via .html()
[15:34:05] <BillCriswell> I'm definitely in.
[15:34:13] <hactor> That's not what HTML does :P why does jQuery do it
[15:34:59] <BillCriswell> Never put a script tag in like that.
[15:35:11] <hactor> Well I do.
[15:35:23] <shoky> then suffer the wrath of the browser
[15:35:45] <hactor> BillCriswell, I have a system of windows (windows sort of) and they load their client stuff via innerHTML the way a page would reload (but scoped to a window)
[15:35:56] <hactor> I can use iframes or innerHTML and I way more prefer innerHTML
[15:36:33] <Poutsa> Hello Dudes......    jquery usage >  http://raw.pro-chan.com/Raw/t/674_1382207920
[15:37:07] <BillCriswell> Poutsa: Why did you link that.
[15:37:29] <Poutsa> To inform people
[15:37:33] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:37:34] <shoky> please don't
[15:37:56] <robertmaxrees> is that link sfw?
[15:38:03] <BillCriswell> Inform people of what?
[15:38:05] <Poutsa> no porn
[15:38:06] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: No.
[15:38:11] <BillCriswell> You don't want to watch.
[15:38:13] <Poutsa> it isnt porn
[15:38:13] <shoky> "Thief tries to steal a motorcycle and has fingers cut by an axe"
[15:38:28] <Robdgreat> how is this relevant to jquery?
[15:38:31] <Poutsa> inform that there are many cultures
[15:38:40] <BillCriswell> In a #jquery channel?
[15:38:41] <robertmaxrees> uuuh
[15:38:45] <Poutsa> because you migh be a developer
[15:38:49] <Poutsa> might*
[15:38:51] <BillCriswell> ... what?
[15:38:53] <shoky> go inform someone else mmk?
[15:38:54] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[15:39:05] <Poutsa> but in case of war.. or some random dudes kidnap you
[15:39:10] <Poutsa> you should be prepared
[15:39:18] <Robdgreat> it has nothing. Nothing. do do with jquery
[15:39:19] <BillCriswell> Ok...
[15:39:23] <shoky> one more and you're out..
[15:39:25] <Robdgreat> *to do
[15:39:49] <Robdgreat> shoky: Poutsa has already established a lack of regard for what is appropriate and is simply spamming
[15:39:52] <kenshou> Soo…i'm kindof new to freenode…any of this channels have moderators?
[15:40:03] <Poutsa> yes and ban
[15:40:26] <Poutsa> everything that takes you out of the comfort zone...
[15:40:39] <Robdgreat> more like things that are offtopic and inappropriate
[15:40:41] <shoky> kenshou: yap
[15:41:01] <Poutsa> you try to forget it, you get angry and say lets ban kick that "spammer"
[15:41:09] <Robdgreat> quotes aren't necessary
[15:41:10] <shoky> indeed
[15:41:11] <Robdgreat> you are spamming
[15:41:23] <Robdgreat> now please go and steal a motorcycle in whatever country
[15:41:28] <Robdgreat> >.>
[15:42:36] <BillCriswell> Interesting feller.
[15:44:11] <hactor> BillCriswell, I just want to clarify my thoughts. I think jquery is annoying becuse I'd never design an API like that. So heavily overloaded a ton of helper functions stuffed all over the place. And yet, it's way too damn useful. How is that possible.
[15:44:59] * shoky squints
[15:45:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:45:37] <faddah> shoky - thanks for that. gawd that was disgusting, even if it was fake. sorry i clicked on it, thought he had actual code to look at.
[15:46:11] <BillCriswell> Yeah, the "jquery usage >" thing was a clear ploy.
[15:46:45] <hactor> People who have been on the Internet for more than one day have seen everything anyway
[15:48:05] <shoky> browser's "click to play" setting for flash/plugins is awesome ;p
[15:51:09] <BillCriswell> Wish i had that.
[15:52:27] <BillCriswell> in use.. or whatever
[15:52:32] <BillCriswell> Damn I'm tired.
[15:52:32] <hactor> BillCriswell, were you traumatized
[15:53:02] <BillCriswell> hactor: No, I've seen way more terrible shit. I just wanted in the mood for that right now.
[15:53:13] <BillCriswell> wasn't not wanted.
[15:53:37] <hactor> Life is cruel overall.
[15:53:44] <hactor> Which is ok cause what else is there
[16:00:40] <BillCriswell> Word.
[16:00:50] <BillCriswell> I just fell asleep for a second.
[16:01:50] <hactor> BillCriswell, why don't you sleep
[16:02:24] <BillCriswell> Girlfriend just got out of the hospital and I need to keep an eye on her.
[16:02:48] <hactor> BillCriswell, oh I see, sorry if my question was inappropriate.
[16:03:12] <BillCriswell> hactor: Not at all.
[16:03:25] <BillCriswell> It's a very logical question lol
[16:05:01] <hactor> BillCriswell, if you start seeing Freddy Krueger during microsleeps, try to stuff him in the furnace.
[16:05:35] <BillCriswell> Will do.
[17:45:54] <toothe> I can get jQuery to HIDE a <tr> tag, but I can't get it to show the tag.
[17:46:30] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ toothe
[17:46:30] <b-ot> toothe: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:46:51] <toothe> sure...
[17:47:23] <toothe> I get this is really simple: http://dpaste.com/36MKBZ0
[17:47:37] <toothe> this *always* returns False.
[17:48:51] <robertmaxrees> you're doin' stuff wrong.
[17:49:21] <toothe> what specifically?
[17:49:30] <robertmaxrees> don't bind inline like that.
[17:49:38] <toothe> bind inline?
[17:49:43] <robertmaxrees> onclick=
[17:49:48] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you the other way to do it.
[17:49:53] <toothe> how would you do it?
[17:50:02] <toothe> okay...
[17:52:03] <robertmaxrees> sorry one sec.
[17:52:09] <toothe> please, take your time.
[17:52:15] <toothe> because I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[17:55:29] <robertmaxrees> okay so which thing do you want to click vs which thing do you want to show/hide?
[17:56:09] <toothe> a link.
[17:56:20] <toothe> a simple <a href="#"> link.
[17:56:27] <robertmaxrees> that's... not what i asked.
[17:56:34] <robertmaxrees> should clicking the link show/hide the text?
[17:56:39] <robertmaxrees> the other text i mean?
[17:56:49] <toothe> which other text?
[17:56:54] <robertmaxrees> "Hide and reappear this"
[17:57:02] <toothe> oh yes..well, the entire <tr> would be ideal.
[17:57:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.  one sec.
[17:57:19] <toothe> sure, I appreciate it. I also want to see what inline stuff I'm doing wrong.
[17:57:23] <toothe> because I do something similar elsehwere.
[17:59:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5z06cjuq/
[17:59:11] <robertmaxrees> do this.
[17:59:35] <toothe> let me check tha tout...
[18:00:03] <robertmaxrees> or this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5z06cjuq/1/
[18:00:08] <robertmaxrees> take the onclick= out of your html.
[18:01:09] <toothe> where is it?
[18:01:22] <robertmaxrees> <tr><td><a id="hideshow" onclick="shower('#hideMe');" href="#">This is the text</a></td></tr>
[18:01:29] <robertmaxrees> remove that part.
[18:01:42] <toothe> but, then how does it know to execute hideshow ?
[18:01:55] <robertmaxrees> are you looking at the most recent one I sent you?
[18:02:01] <toothe> I believe so.
[18:02:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5z06cjuq/1/
[18:02:06] <toothe> no, im not
[18:02:10] <robertmaxrees> $hideshow.on('click', toggleHide);
[18:02:13] <robertmaxrees> that's how it knows.
[18:02:14] <robertmaxrees> .on()
[18:03:11] <toothe> hm...im not understanding this.
[18:03:22] <robertmaxrees> where are you lost?
[18:03:45] <toothe> so, you said line 14 adds the onclick, right?
[18:03:50] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[18:04:06] <toothe> the second argument, toggleHide is the function
[18:04:08] <toothe> what is 'click' ?
[18:04:11] <robertmaxrees> the event.
[18:04:18] <robertmaxrees> .on('event', callback)
[18:04:39] <toothe> why is this better than onclick ?
[18:05:32] <robertmaxrees> putting knowledge of JS in your HTML binds things together.
[18:05:47] <toothe> also, this seems to be custom-written for a single <tr> But I am going to apply this to 300+ <tr>'s
[18:05:56] <robertmaxrees> sure you could.
[18:06:01] <robertmaxrees> easy change.
[18:06:05] <toothe> so, you're setting a variable $hideMe, but that means I would have to create 300+ hideMe's
[18:06:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5z06cjuq/2/
[18:06:25] <toothe> err, I get that i'll have to create 300+ html elements with unique ID's
[18:06:35] <robertmaxrees> use a class yo
[18:06:37] <robertmaxrees> not IDs
[18:06:47] <robertmaxrees> oh i see what you';re saying.
[18:08:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid using a table if possible.
[18:08:34] <toothe> why?
[18:09:05] <robertmaxrees> tables are dumb hahaha
[18:09:10] <toothe> why?
[18:09:17] <robertmaxrees> are you presenting tabular data?
[18:09:19] <toothe> I'm genuinely asking - aren't they great for formatting data in a clean way?
[18:09:21] <toothe> yes....
[18:09:25] <toothe> this is a small snippet of what I'm doing
[18:09:30] <robertmaxrees> okay, then we need ot apply some traversal.
[18:09:36] <toothe> but, in my code I present a lot of tables, so I use <table>
[18:10:05] <robertmaxrees> sure - i'd normally suggest you avoid tables unless you have actually tabular data.
[18:10:15] <robertmaxrees> let me show you another way to do this.
[18:10:32] <robertmaxrees> could you expand the markup to illustrate what multiple items might look like?
[18:10:41] <toothe> sure, a moment please.
[18:11:47] <toothe> I'm going to beka your code...
[18:11:55] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[18:12:51] <toothe> http://jsfiddle.net/5z06cjuq/4/
[18:13:06] <toothe> i use 4 examples, but in my case i'll have upwards of 300+
[18:14:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5z06cjuq/5/
[18:14:42] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[18:16:53] <decx> this aint no tabular data
[18:18:22] <robertmaxrees> ^agreed.
[18:20:45] <cjohnson> toothe: $(this) not $hideMe
[18:20:54] <cjohnson> woops, nevermind
[18:20:55] <robertmaxrees> i think you mean me ;)
[18:21:06] <robertmaxrees> i was fixing it.  the entire thing is funky.
[18:23:28] <toothe> im having trouble wrapping my mind around this, no idea idea...
[18:23:40] <robertmaxrees> step through it and tell us where you're lost.
[18:24:21] <toothe> let me try to implement it...I think i just need to type it out.
[18:24:33] <robertmaxrees> good luck.  i'm going now.  enjoy.
[18:25:08] <toothe> thank you very very much
[18:25:10] <cjohnson> toothe: the key is to make the event handler find the node to hide/show relative to the button that emitted the event to begin with
[18:25:17] <toothe> right...
[18:25:23] <toothe> why is this better thought than onclick ?
[18:25:27] <toothe> than directly setting onclick?
[18:25:36] <cjohnson> you want it to be for 300 elements
[18:25:45] <cjohnson> onclick requires copy and pasting your JS 300 times for that
[18:25:47] <cjohnson> terrible
[18:26:22] <cjohnson> paste some real HTML that you intend to make collapsible
[18:26:26] <cjohnson> your tabular data
[18:40:02] <toothe> when I copy/paste it to my code, it doesn't quite do the same thing.
[18:40:30] <toothe> it just goes to /url/#
[18:41:01] <toothe> but, i think this is because the JS loads before the HTML.
[18:42:20] <toothe> yeah....let me remove your code from mmine and see if I can get it to work again.
[18:42:39] <cjohnson> paste your html to a bin and we can figure out the right relative selector you need
[18:42:42] <cjohnson> there are lots of options
[18:43:02] <toothe> sure...just a moment.
[18:43:05] <toothe> its a little big though
[18:46:57] <toothe> cjohnson: Here you go : http://dpaste.com/35T6TQ1
[18:47:18] <toothe> the script begins on line 12.
[18:48:42] <cjohnson> toothe: here are some examples for how to do hide/show relative to the button http://jsfiddle.net/ty3dxdm8/2/
[18:50:12] <cjohnson> you probably want to remove the id in your example, since it's in a loop
[18:50:14] <cjohnson> and ID must be unique
[18:50:54] <toothe> done.
[18:50:57] <toothe> but, what am I doing wrong?
[18:51:33] <cjohnson> you are right, the JS is executing before the page has loaded
[18:51:43] <cjohnson> wrap that whole block in $(document).ready(function() { .... });
[18:57:25] <toothe> no, still not doing it...
[18:59:10] <toothe> can I show yo how it renders?
[18:59:14] <toothe> i don't understand why its not working.
[19:00:34] <cjohnson> sure
[19:00:40] <cjohnson> check your console for errors
[19:00:43] <cjohnson> make sure jquery is loaded
[19:00:43] <cjohnson> etc
[19:03:53] <toothe> Here: http://dpaste.com/119156G
[19:06:15] <cjohnson> now read your console.
[19:07:27] <toothe> okay, just asec.
[19:08:30] <toothe> oh, an error...
[19:08:38] <toothe> Uncaught: SyntaxError: UNexpected end of input
[19:09:20] <toothe> I think its saying something is wrong with jquery
[19:09:50] <toothe> huh....
[19:14:56] <toothe> damn
[19:15:01] <toothe> I don't know what's wrong.
[19:16:59] <dglambert> Question, does the post() method refresh the page?
[19:17:53] <cjohnson> toothe: you didn't copy what I wrote correctly
[19:17:56] <cjohnson> }); not }
[19:18:06] <cjohnson> it even tells you the line it's on
[19:20:21] <toothe> ...
[19:20:25] <toothe> that's wat the issue was>...?
[19:20:29] <toothe> how'd you find that? what told you?
[19:22:07] <cjohnson> my eyes
[19:22:21] <cjohnson> but if you look at your console it tells you which line the error is on
[19:23:20] <toothe> hm...it was pointing the error at jqueyr's file

[19:55:47] <toothe> how do I make a <tr> hidden by default?
[20:33:41] <cjohnson> toothe: <tr style="display: none;">
[20:42:46] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[20:48:10] <toothe> cjohnson: Yep!
[21:24:00] <z1haze> how, using jquery do you just output html, based on an if statement
[21:24:25] <z1haze> is there a way to do it without targeting a div? like just have it print out right where i have the jquery?
[21:50:48] <x-finite> i have a div2 inside div1 container, there are multiple div1 containers on the page each with a div2. When i hover on a div1 container, I want only the div2 inside it to hide. Doing this: http://pastebin.com/2kwqprcE simply hides the first div2 no matter which div1 container I hover on
[21:53:58] <systemfault> x-finite: Just in case, do you understand that you cannot have more than one element with a specific ID?
[21:54:46] <x-finite> systemfault multiple elements with specific class are ok?
[21:54:56] <systemfault> Sure
[21:55:19] <x-finite> systemfault adjusted code ;)
[21:55:24] <x-finite> still not working thou
[21:55:45] <systemfault> x-finite: Yup, because you're hiding ALL the elements with the class
[21:55:55] <x-finite> wait
[21:56:01] <systemfault> x-finite: Within the event handler, the current element is "this"
[21:56:09] <x-finite> systemfault i am using this now $(this).children('.social-icons').hide();
[21:56:17] <x-finite> paste it old, but still not working
[21:56:26] <systemfault> So you can do: $(this).find('.social-icons').hide();
[21:57:01] <x-finite> systemfault works now, i thought .children would work in this case
[21:57:26] <systemfault> Good
