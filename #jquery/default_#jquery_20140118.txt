[01:16:59] <Nezt> Does anyone know of a good source of (code examples) that show JS vs the JQuery alternative side by side
[01:22:53] <svetlana> As a follow-up, ##programming had suggested me to use <label for="idOfRadio">. Thanks for bearing with the stupid HTML, non-jQuery, question here.
[01:23:59] <Nezt> NO QUESTION IS STUPID FOR HE WHO SEEKS KNOWLEDGE IS AMONG THE KWISATZ HADERACH
[01:39:11] <jop008> Someone use the jqte text widget on jq mobile?
[01:41:54] <svetlana> Nezt: :-)
[01:46:12] <nevahsobah> I just wanted to say I love you all
[01:47:32] <Uhkis> :D
[01:48:02] <nevahsobah> $('#jquery').each(function() { this.hug(); });
[01:49:42] <nevahsobah> I was like so mad today
[01:50:21] <nevahsobah> cuz my boss said, "Restyle website"
[01:50:26] <nevahsobah> I like cringed
[01:50:45] <nevahsobah> my css is a fucking mess
[01:53:08] <Uhkis> rm -rf website/ and start redesigning ;)

[02:30:54] <paulvd> hello, i have a set of divs (variable), and i want to calculate which div has the heightest height, how can i go about it
[03:18:31] <paulvd> hello, i have made a fiddle here, where I want to put the active class to the longest div, but its putting that in all http://jsfiddle.net/j3uSt/
[03:19:21] <GoSox> so do .slideUp() and .slideDown() already check if an object is visible, or invisible? so i don't have to check first before using them? i can just use them?
[03:23:48] <vinky> paulvd, you seem to be recreating h each time
[03:24:08] <vinky> ehr, nvm
[03:24:46] <paulvd> um yea just to store the height?
[03:25:12] <vinky> I misread
[03:25:18] <paulvd> prolly its not grabbing the "h div"
[03:26:25] <vinky> actually what you do is comparing the height to max which is always 0
[03:36:46] <paulvd> hm ok
[03:39:40] <ribot> hi
[03:41:01] <ribot> how can i toggle an element's visibility using a variable? something like: var visibility = 'show'; $element.visibility() // <- should do $element.show()
[03:50:22] <jop008> Searching for a rich text editor which must work with jqueyr mobile any suggestions?
[04:00:43] <anom> Hey. http://jsfiddle.net/kMv3H/3/ what am I doing wrong?
[04:04:14] <ribot> i find another solution
[04:04:17] <ribot> bye
[04:05:56] <vinky> anom, have you checked what errors you get?
[04:07:01] <anom> Yes, I honestly don't understand them.
[04:07:29] <anom> Though it seems, adding the keys to the array fixed it. Think I prefer the PHP way.
[04:09:24] <daslicht> anom: what you are trying to do?
[04:10:08] <anom> Basically make that commented array.
[04:10:16] <anom> http://jsfiddle.net/kMv3H/4/ this seems to work though
[04:29:55] <paulvd> jQuery(".active").resize(function() { will run when the .active div is resized ?
[04:52:53] <paulvd> how can i run a script only when a particular div is resized ?
[05:00:26] <jop008> Anyone used hyperlinks in textarea using jquery + jquery mobile?
[05:56:29] <dopie> hey guys
[05:57:02] <dopie> I have this https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/8490910  in dev.staycreativedesign.com
[05:57:07] <dopie> scroll down to recent works
[05:57:13] <dopie> and click on the big image
[05:57:26] <dopie> the effect doesnt complete entirely and loads the link
[06:01:09] <Jonta> Mrrrâ€¦ l2link.
[06:01:19] <Jonta> http://dev.staycreativedesign.com
[06:01:22] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/HQ3LJ/  why isn thtis working
[06:01:39] <dopie> Jonta,  :)
[06:01:46] <dopie> l2link what does that mean?
[06:02:11] <Jonta> l2 = Please learn to, because it would benefit you and others, making for a happier world.
[06:02:27] <Jonta> I don't understand the issue btw.
[06:02:42] <Jonta> Which effect doesn't complete entirely?
[06:02:44] <dopie> I am trying to fadeout the image and then load the link
[06:02:57] <dopie> i want the fadeOut to complete and then load the link
[06:02:58] <Jonta> The man on the tracks?
[06:03:01] <dopie> correct
[06:03:10] <Jonta> Which link?
[06:03:26] <dopie> <a href="works/1">
[06:03:37] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/HQ3LJ/
[06:04:08] <dopie> i want the animation to complete itself
[06:04:30] <paulvd> next div can be targetted by .next, what about previous div ?
[06:04:30] <dopie> and then goto the link
[06:04:49] <dopie> paulvd,  what?
[06:04:52] <Jonta> paulvd: .prev?
[06:04:59] <Jonta> .back?
[06:05:17] <paulvd> what about next next
[06:05:33] <paulvd> jQuery('slide-next').next('div').addClass('slide-next1'); ?
[06:05:44] <paulvd> considering that .slide-next is the div before
[06:06:39] <dopie> not sure how that makes any sense to this?
[06:07:17] <paulvd> here's that part of code
[06:07:17] <paulvd> http://pastebin.com/XzLNC0Rt
[06:07:30] <paulvd> its setting the active one, and the next one
[06:08:05] <dopie> i'm still not sure on how this is going to help me on what i am trying to accomplish
[06:08:12] <Jonta> dopie: He's not answering your question, he's got one of his own =)
[06:08:16] <paulvd> its not for your problem :D
[06:08:21] <dopie> oh hahaha!!
[06:08:24] <paulvd> lol
[06:08:29] <dopie> sorry i got extremely confused
[06:08:34] <Jonta> Not everything revolves around _you_ you know!
[06:08:37] <Jonta> :p
[06:08:45] <dopie> he just started chatting out of nowhere
[06:08:46] <dopie> :)
[06:09:05] <Jonta> Just like you.
[06:09:22] <Jonta> Soâ€¦ you want the main page to appear, and then fade out after a bit?
[06:09:23] <paulvd> heh
[06:09:32] <dopie> Jonta, correct
[06:09:45] <dopie> well
[06:09:49] <dopie> it does it thing
[06:09:52] <dopie> the user clicks on the image
[06:09:59] <dopie> the main-page fadesOut
[06:10:06] <dopie> then loads the link
[06:10:29] <paulvd> then whats the problem
[06:10:36] <paulvd> use .click function
[06:10:47] <paulvd> fade out that div and fade in the other one
[06:11:10] <paulvd> dopie: if you make a fiddle, getting answers would be faster
[06:12:08] <Jonta> He has
[06:12:50] <paulvd> ok just saw
[06:14:13] <paulvd> doesnt understand what he wants to do there
[06:15:13] <dopie> paulvd i want the user to click the image, than .main page fades out then loads the link
[06:16:09] <paulvd> loads which link?
[06:16:17] <dopie> <a href="http://google.com">
[06:17:07] <paulvd> you have to probably store that in a variable before the fadeout function
[06:17:59] <dopie> paulvd,  can you fiddle it?
[06:18:12] <dopie> im not really a jquery pro or amateur
[06:18:20] <dopie> im worst than green
[06:21:33] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/HQ3LJ/
[06:22:05] <paulvd> open that frame in a new window
[06:22:10] <paulvd> the url wont load there
[06:29:09] <paulvd> am trying to do this in a window.load function, the first two is fine, the last one is not running http://pastebin.com/FAZqCwQR
[06:31:43] <paulvd> ok managed to do that
[06:31:56] <paulvd> how do i target the div before ? .prev and .back didnt work
[06:38:03] <Crucials> .prev should work just the same as next
[06:41:53] <dekiss> how can I set queue to false
[06:53:11] <grek> i i have too short chosen + jscrollpane demo on http://europediscovering.com/h/europediscovering - select escolha a distro
[06:53:32] <grek> any one have idea how to fix it ?
[07:07:41] <dekiss> can I use fadeOut() without making style display none?
[07:16:03] <paulvd> dekiss: if you are using fadeout whats the point of display none
[07:16:42] <jop008> In a textearea field I want my users to be able to add hyperlinks how to do that?
[07:20:41] <dekiss> if I set click event listener to a div with some id and I then I delete that id from the div and give to another div, where will event listener be, on the first div that I origianlly set right?
[07:20:58] <dekiss> paulvd fadeOut() sets display none
[07:26:53] <paulvd> yes it does DEADB33F
[07:26:56] <paulvd> dekiss sorry
[07:27:20] <paulvd> jop008: why cant they add it now?
[07:27:39] <paulvd> or jop008 maybe you need a WYSIWYG editor
[07:27:54] <jop008> since it is a textarea field and I am using jquery mobile as well
[07:28:13] <jop008> and that conflicts I tested many solutions like jqte
[07:31:24] <dekiss> lol
[07:37:27] <paulvd> am trying to run a function on "jQuery(".active").resize(function(e){" but its not running at all should i use anything else when that .active div resizes?
[08:03:24] <masscrx> i want to make edit function but in modal window with ajax, in normal cake style, i should make action 'edit' in controller and view 'edit', then action will load all data to form

[09:18:29] <dopie> how do i get the css transition and then the url loads?
[09:18:39] <dopie> e.preventdefault
[09:18:39] <dopie> ?
[09:22:26] <paulvd> dopie: i already made that for you and its working fine
[09:22:33] <paulvd> so whats wrong in there
[09:22:45] <dopie> paulvd,  what?
[09:22:59] <dopie> you did
[09:22:59] <dopie> ?!
[09:23:00] <dopie> where?!
[09:23:17] <paulvd> that thing you are using was created by me and you forgot LOL
[09:23:31] <dopie> wait what?!@
[09:23:32] <DonkeyDong> would anyone be able to guess why this  isnt working? http://cagespider.com/login
[09:23:45] <dopie> i just spent 45mins looking at w3 ! :)
[09:24:06] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/Uj5QY/
[09:24:16] <paulvd> lol?
[09:24:26] <paulvd> didnt i create it for you an hour ago?
[09:24:43] <paulvd> i guess you are doped then
[09:25:29] <dopie> ahhh you did
[09:25:34] <dopie> but fadeOut is horrible
[09:25:34] <dopie> :)
[09:25:43] <paulvd> whats horrible?
[09:25:50] <paulvd> i didnt make it to please you
[09:25:56] <dopie> rofl
[09:25:57] <paulvd> its coz you wanted it that way
[09:26:08] <paulvd> and its free help
[09:26:10] <dopie> dont i need to prevent defeault
[09:26:10] <dopie> :)
[09:26:14] <paulvd> so horrible is your mind
[09:26:15] <dopie> default
[09:26:21] <paulvd> for what you need that
[09:26:22] <dopie> paulvd,  sorry man i got lost here
[09:26:30] <paulvd> do you know what preventdefautl is?
[09:26:33] <dopie> yes
[09:26:33] <paulvd> lt*
[09:26:33] <decx> yeah css3 transition is better that fadeout, you can get a callback on that with $(element).bind("transitionend webkitTransitionEnd oTransitionEnd MSTransitionEnd", function(){ });
[09:26:48] <dopie> it prevents the default action
[09:27:04] <decx> you have prevent-default on the wrong element
[09:27:08] <decx> gotta prevent the anchor
[09:27:24] <paulvd> you're here 3 hours, yet i dont know what you are trying to achieve lol
[09:27:38] <decx> like $('a.mylink').click(function(){ return false; })
[09:27:54] <dopie> paulvd i am trying to achieve .... user clicks on the image , image fades, than loads ahref
[09:30:35] <Nirvash> delboy1978uk_: Show me the way oh wise one
[09:30:50] <delboy1978uk_> ok first you  want jquery
[09:31:03] <delboy1978uk_> google google jquery cdn
[09:31:19] <delboy1978uk_> you'll see google developer hosted libraries
[09:31:22] <krastavac> can I calculate y position of div's top edge any other way that doesn't include subtracting other content height from window height?
[09:31:47] <Nirvash> delboy1978uk_: What's the problem with what I have now?
[09:31:58] <delboy1978uk_> there is a copy and paste snippet to get jquery loaded
[09:32:18] <delboy1978uk_> I'm just crap with plain js - trust me this is better
[09:32:23] <delboy1978uk_> easier
[09:32:41] <Nirvash> Alright
[09:32:58] <delboy1978uk_> ok paste that into the head section
[09:33:29] <Nirvash> I'm looking for it now
[09:34:32] <delboy1978uk_> here <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[09:34:52] <dopie> decx, am i using preventDefault the correct way?
[09:34:53] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/Uj5QY/2/
[09:34:56] <Nirvash> alright, good to go delboy1978uk_
[09:35:03] <delboy1978uk_> awesome
[09:35:41] <delboy1978uk_> in your script tag, type $(document).ready(function(){   //your code here  });
[09:36:00] <delboy1978uk_> this is like your window.onload thing
[09:36:11] <delboy1978uk_> and code will only run once page is ready
[09:37:15] <decx> dopie you prevent default on the click on recent-work which is a div, this won't affect clicking on the anchor that's inside .recent-work
[09:37:48] <decx> $('.recent-work a') will target you link directly
[09:38:00] <Nirvash> ready delboy1978uk_
[09:38:04] <delboy1978uk_> good
[09:38:42] <delboy1978uk_> replace that onload line with just setLocation();
[09:39:58] <delboy1978uk_> var x = $('#latitude');
[09:41:41] <Nirvash> delboy1978uk_: sorry, could you repeat what you just said
[09:41:56] <delboy1978uk_> x.val('Latitude: ' + position.coords.latitude);
[09:42:07] <delboy1978uk_> which part?
[09:42:18] <Nirvash> And what did you say right before that? My IRC connection died =/
[09:42:31] <delboy1978uk_> ah
[09:42:39] <delboy1978uk_> replace that onload line with just setLocation();
[09:42:57] <Nirvash> Alright, time for x.val am I putting that in jquery?
[09:42:58] <decx> dopie http://jsfiddle.net/Uj5QY/4/
[09:43:34] <delboy1978uk_> in jquery, you set a value like this $('#id').val(variable);
[09:43:51] <delboy1978uk_> to get it, $('#id').val();
[09:44:03] <dopie> decx,  howly shit balls
[09:44:23] <decx> we bind transitionend to get a callback when your fadeout transition ends
[09:44:55] <Nirvash> delboy1978uk_: Sorry for being dense, but what exactly is the point of x.val?
[09:45:08] <decx> that way you get the benefits of css3 performance with easy to handle jquery
[09:45:25] <delboy1978uk_> var x = $('#latitude');
[09:45:44] <Velveeta> i keep forgetting they provide the transition* events
[09:46:26] <Nirvash> delboy1978uk_: var x and var y defined
[09:46:51] <delboy1978uk_> can you upload or paste so i can see the js as it stands right now?
[09:47:02] <Nirvash> live now
[09:47:06] <delboy1978uk_> awesome
[09:48:08] <decx> Velveeta i used to parse css transition to get the time, that was a mess. then i slapped myself a few thousand times when i found out about transition events
[09:48:14] <decx> :D
[09:48:41] <Nirvash> delboy1978uk_: So I have values posting now
[09:48:49] <Velveeta> heheheh
[09:48:53] <Nirvash> But how am I sending values directly to mail?
[09:48:54] <delboy1978uk_> are they posting? :-D
[09:49:43] <dopie> decx im cap what i have now
[09:49:51] <Nirvash> delboy1978uk_: Sigh, nope =/
[09:49:58] <dopie> and then ill show you whats happening visually
[09:50:07] <delboy1978uk_> didn't think they would yet hold on
[09:51:20] <acerspyro> Accessing jquery.com ends up in google chrome telling me "This page has a redirect loop"
[09:51:22] <acerspyro> :/
[09:51:34] <Nirvash> acerspyro: I noticed that too, check isitdown.org
[09:51:37] <Nirvash> or whatever it is
[09:52:07] <acerspyro> kk, ty
[09:52:35] <acerspyro> isitup.org
[09:52:52] <decx> i sit up as well
[09:52:57] <decx> i tried to sit upside down
[09:52:59] <decx> didnt end well
[09:53:07] <acerspyro> It says it's up
[09:53:18] <acerspyro> decx, did you try crazy glue on the ceiling?
[09:53:30] <dopie> decx,  for some reason when i apply your code to my site stuff doesn't work :) !!!
[09:53:30] <decx> na i just didnt wipe for a week
[09:53:34] <dopie> what a surprise
[09:53:41] <acerspyro> lol
[09:56:46] <delboy1978uk_> Nirvash http://pastie.org/8645686
[09:57:33] <delboy1978uk_> on your php first line say die(var_dump($_POST));
[09:58:20] <delboy1978uk_> wait i forgot the showPosition function lol
[10:00:29] <DonkeyDong> would anyone be able to guess why this isnt working? http://cagespider.com/login
[10:01:28] <decx> guessing hu? well i'm gonna guess it's gremlins
[10:02:07] <delboy1978uk_> Nirvash where is this position variable coming from?
[10:06:16] <Nirvash> sorry man, i'm back
[10:06:52] <olavk_> Hi! A question about documentation: According to the documentation .ajaxSuccess(), .ajaxComplete() and .load() callbacks receive a XMLHttpRequest object as one of the arguments. But isn't this actually the jsXHR wrapper now?
[10:12:32] <shoky> olavk_: yes
[10:13:08] <olavk_> Thanks. Ok, I'll make a fix to the docs.
[10:23:42] <s5fs> Sorry gang, we're working on the redirect loop right now.
[10:25:36] <ryanneufeld> in the mean time, you can still get to https://jquery.com/
[10:36:33] <acerspyro> Thanks, s5fs
[10:36:46] <ya> hello, can anyone help me
[10:36:53] <ya> http://publicdomainworks.net/
[10:36:59] <dekiss> how can I select second child of a node ?
[10:37:01] <ya> if you press the little 'gear' icon under the "Calculate" button, it works... but if you try and search for a work/author (try with e.g. "pianist") and then press Search, as the output comes out, nothing happens when pclicking on the small gear iconsnext to the results
[10:37:09] <ya> i dont understand why, since it's exactly the same code
[10:37:15] <ya> i id="calc"  class="fa fa-gears fa-fw"></i>
[10:37:21] <ya>  $('#calc').on('click', calculate);
[10:37:27] <ya> why does one works, but not the others ?
[10:37:58] <Velveeta> i'm gonna guess those results are rendered on the fly
[10:38:05] <Velveeta> and not at the time the page loads, right?
[10:38:45] <Velveeta> bueller?
[10:39:00] <krastavac> what will this return nodes or strings concatenated? $("#div_id :input");
[10:39:10] <Velveeta> nodes
[10:39:19] <Velveeta> in a jqurey-wrapped collection
[10:39:22] <Velveeta> jquery*
[10:40:47] <dekiss> Velveeta ^
[10:40:54] <krastavac> or array?
[10:40:55] <krastavac> is there iterator for that?
[10:41:15] <Velveeta> you can use jQuery.each to iterate over the collection
[10:41:22] <Velveeta> or you can manually do it with a for-loop
[10:41:28] <Velveeta> it's not an array, but it is an array-like object
[10:41:42] <Velveeta> you can reference it with numeric indexes, and it provides a .length property like an array would
[10:41:55] <dekiss> is this ok? $("#storyTitle").html($("#first img").storyName);
[10:42:14] <dekiss> Velveeta how can I select 2 node from a parent node
[10:42:18] <dekiss> 2=second
[10:42:46] <Velveeta> dekiss: do you want it wrapped as a jquery object, or just a raw element node?
[10:43:52] <Velveeta> yourParent.children(':eq(1)') or yourParent.children().eq(1) will give you a jquery-wrapped version, yourParent.children()[1] or yourParent.children().get(1) will give you the raw element reference
[10:45:29] <dekiss> Velveeta not sure, tell me oth ways
[10:45:37] <Velveeta> i just did
[10:45:41] <dekiss> thanks
[10:45:50] <krastavac> ok
[10:49:00] <dekiss> this worked now again it isn't working
[10:49:02] <dekiss> $("#storyTitle").html($("#first img").storyName);
[10:49:55] <decx> hm nice Velveeta didnt know about children()[1]
[10:50:30] <dekiss> any idea?
[10:55:46] <dekiss> Velveeta ?
[10:56:09] <decx> what are you trying to do?
[10:56:16] <decx> cba to read :>
[10:57:06] <dekiss> $("#first img").storyName)
[10:57:10] <dekiss> this returns array?
[10:58:07] <dekiss> I can swear this worked "#storyTitle").html($("#first img").storyName);
[10:58:09] <decx> depends on what the funciton storyName does
[10:58:28] <dekiss> hm
[10:58:35] <dekiss> this returns array $("#first img")[0].storyName
[10:58:38] <dekiss> so it should be like this
[10:58:44] <dekiss> but yeah that above worked
[10:58:45] <dekiss> lol
[11:00:07] <decx> so there are several img in a container #first, and you want to run the storyname function on one of them or all of them?
[11:06:22] <Velveeta> dekiss: make us a fiddle so we can see what you're trying to accomplish
[11:07:06] <dekiss> its solved now thanks
[11:07:28] <decx> i was so curious now.... *nooooo*
[11:08:27] <Velveeta> heheheh
[11:22:31] <igcewieling> I'm a bit of a jQuery n00b.   I have some HTML I'm POSTing using .ajax, when the data comes through it seems badly escaped.  For example:  Ficke    [amp;_Associates<br_style] => "cursor: default;"> when the content of the cell in the original html is "Ficke & Associates"  Does anyone have any ideas?
[11:37:41] <ya> Velveeta: can you help me?
[11:38:11] <ya> i'm really confused at the moment
[11:38:27] <Velveeta> sure
[11:38:36] <ya> did you see my website?
[11:38:38] <Velveeta> so first, i need the answer to my previous question
[11:38:44] <Velveeta> no i didn't, i probably won't need to
[11:39:04] <ya> so one is static, and the others are all dynamically created
[11:39:10] <ya> the static one works, not the others
[11:39:24] <Velveeta> ok perfect, so the reason the others aren't working is that those nodes don't exist at the time you're binding the event
[11:39:34] <ya> aah
[11:39:39] <Velveeta> so you need to bind to a higher-level container and have it listen on behalf of that selector
[11:39:44] <Velveeta> it's called event delegation
[11:39:48] <ya> what do you mean?
[11:40:19] <ya> Velveeta: but then i also tried to do: <i id="calc" onclick="calculate();"></i>
[11:40:22] <Velveeta> you can bind to the closest parent container if there's a common parent to all of them, or just straight ot the document as a call-all for any new content, but you'll have a slight bit more overhead that way because the events have to bubble further up the dom, here's an example implementation
[11:40:35] <Velveeta> oh, alsoâ€¦. do they all have an id of "calc" ?
[11:40:36] <ya> but then on runtime, i get the following error: onclick - Uncaught ReferenceError: calculate is not defined
[11:40:50] <ya> Velveeta: yea, all id="calc"
[11:40:57] <Boggie> Hello. I have a question regarding the .text() method. I am trying to use it to retrieve the contents of a textbox yet however it seems to return a 0 length string. Is there something I might have overlooked? :) Thank you. I am also quite new to the whole jQuery usage.
[11:41:02] <Velveeta> ok, so that's gonna be something you need to change, as it's invalid markup
[11:41:10] <Velveeta> id's are supposed to be unique within the document
[11:41:17] <Velveeta> you should change that to a class or something instead
[11:41:29] <Velveeta> and then you can do something like this: $(document).on('click', '.calc', calculate)
[11:41:33] <ya> hmmm.. and then $('.calc') ?
[11:41:39] <ya> ok
[11:41:48] <Velveeta> you bind the listener to the document, and tell it to listen to clicks coming from .calc elements, and fire calculate as the callback
[11:42:30] <ya> can i have 2 classes to a <i> though ?
[11:42:42] <Velveeta> you can have as many classes as you want on any element
[11:44:08] <ya> it doesnt work though
[11:44:09] <ya> :)
[11:44:20] <ya> <i  class="fa fa-gears fa-fw" class="calc"></i>
[11:44:36] <Velveeta> oh no, not 2 separate class attributes, combine them
[11:44:42] <Velveeta> class="fa fa-gears fa-fw calc"
[11:44:46] <ya> oh
[11:45:46] <ya> ok but it doesnt work :>
[11:46:00] <Velveeta> so show me a demo on jsfiddle and i'll see what i can do with it
[11:47:29] <ya> it's the $('document').on('click', '.calc',  calculate);
[11:47:32] <ya> that doesnt work
[11:47:43] <Velveeta> document doesn't go in quotes
[11:47:47] <ya> cause if i use $('.calc').on('click', calculate), it works fine (the static one at least)
[11:47:50] <Velveeta> document is an object, not a selector
[11:47:54] <ya> ah ;)
[11:48:28] <ya> yayyy
[11:48:33] <ya> it works :D
[11:48:34] <Velveeta> woo hoo!
[11:49:07] <decx> what are the pros and cons to $(document).on as opposed to binding new events when you create new markup?
[11:49:51] <Velveeta> you mean like directly binding the the elements after they've been injected?
[11:49:57] <decx> ye
[11:50:21] <Velveeta> for one thing, it keeps from having to redo that maintenance task each time you inject new content, and for another, it's a lower resource footprint
[11:50:28] <Velveeta> you're only binding 1 event listener instead of N
[11:50:54] <decx> so win win
[11:51:05] <Velveeta> but i don't usually bind to the document, itself, i generally bind to a parent container of some kind, to reduce the amount of bubbling that needs to go on and isolate the scope of that listener
[11:51:36] <Velveeta> so if i know that all (e.g. .calc) of my elements are within the .container container, i'll do $('.container').on('click', '.calc', calculate) instead of $(document)
[11:51:47] <decx> oh so parent.on is also "live"
[11:52:11] <decx> hm good to know
[11:52:30] <Velveeta> yep, .on is the consolidated .bind, .delegate, and .live function
[11:53:14] <Velveeta> one of the best use cases i can think of is like table cells
[11:53:27] <Boggie> I will say this jQuery sure changed my view on JavaScript :) I used to be quite frightened of it.
[11:53:36] <Velveeta> let's say you want to make a click handler that makes a cell editable, and you want to dynamically add new columns and rows to it
[11:53:59] <Velveeta> yeah, jquery does a lot to normalize the browser quirks and provide convenience functions, and other frameworks help add structure on top of that
[11:54:34] <Velveeta> if you had say, a 10x10 table, that wouldn't be too difficult to bind directly to all of the td's, but if you expand that to 100x100, now you're talking about 10000 cells
[11:54:43] <Velveeta> and that'll bring a browser to its knees
[11:55:07] <Velveeta> but if you bind 1 to the table itself, and tell it to listen for clicks from 'td', then you get the same behavior with a single event binding
[12:03:15] <Boggie> Velveeta, isn't 10000 cells a little scary?
[12:04:45] <Velveeta> definitely, but it's only to demonstrate a point
[12:05:19] <Velveeta> i've had pages that *did* have thousands of div containers on it, with dropdown menus that had to have click listeners
[12:07:03] <Boggie> frightening :)
[12:07:13] <Velveeta> yepyep, it was for social stream management
[12:07:20] <trupheenix> are there any experts here who can help me with the history object? http://pastebin.ca/2558250
[12:07:46] <Velveeta> they wanted people to be able to monitor posts on various social streams, and add as many as they wanted, with each starting with 50 items, with the option to pull in more and more
[12:07:47] <ryanneufeld> ?ask

[12:08:03] <Boggie> I am new to the whole jQuery thing and i am still amazed at what it can do :)
[12:08:29] <trupheenix> thing is I am trying to do a simple history stack demo where I am juggling the history by changing the url and displaying appropriate divs
[12:08:45] <Velveeta> boggie: just wait till you expand beyond jquery alone and start combining it with development frameworks that use it as part of their core, like backbone/marionette or angularjs :D
[12:08:54] <trupheenix> I am able to do a successful history.pushState while going forward by clicking on the buttons in my HTML UI
[12:09:07] <trupheenix> I am also able to go backwards by clicking on the browser back button.
[12:09:09] <Boggie> :D
[12:09:14] <Boggie> Looking forward to it actually.
[12:09:15] <Boggie> :D
[12:09:31] <Velveeta> front end engineering has gotten to be its own whole specialization these days
[12:09:45] <trupheenix> The problem that happens is when I go back and then I try to go forward using the button in my UI. Then the history.pushState function doesn't get called. It pulls some other object and I cannot make out what that is.
[12:10:46] <Velveeta> trupheenix: i haven't done any work w/ pushstate yet, but have read some about it, don't you store a data object w/ the history, which is returned when that state is pulled again?
[12:11:16] <trupheenix> Velveeta, why don't you try my sample page? http://pastebin.ca/2558250
[12:11:29] <trupheenix> Velveeta, i'm getting confused on why my data object is getting corrupt.
[12:11:50] <trupheenix> Velveeta, i have attached click listeners to my buttons and I am passing appropriate data parameters
[12:12:12] <Velveeta> that's not a working demo though.. unless pastebin is your site and i'm missing something
[12:12:56] <trupheenix> Velveeta, hmmm.. i cannot give a working demo because I don't have my own webserver :(
[12:13:09] <Velveeta> you can use something like jsbin or jsfiddle to create a demo
[12:13:13] <trupheenix> Velveeta, I put the source to my HTML page
[12:13:21] <trupheenix> Velveeta, it won't work in JSFiddle
[12:13:34] <trupheenix> Velveeta, this involves browser state
[12:15:01] <Velveeta> that works just fine in jsfiddle
[12:15:13] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/9r3LS/
[12:15:42] <Velveeta> i mean as far as putting the demo together, but yes it has errors
[12:16:06] <trupheenix> Velveeta, no it doesn't work in JSFiddle
[12:16:17] <trupheenix> Velveeta, you cannot cycle between the history states using the browser back button
[12:16:31] <Velveeta> oh, i was just hitting backspace
[12:17:05] <trupheenix> Velveeta, :)
[12:18:23] <ya> hey Velveeta
[12:18:28] <ya> maybe you can help me again :)
[12:19:21] <ya> http://publicdomainworks.net/ -- if you search for "pianist" it works perfectly, but if you search for "piano" it gives lots of 'undefined' results - even though http://publicdomainworks.net/list?query=piano works well
[12:19:22] <trupheenix> Velveeta, is there any concept in JS like call by value or call by reference? It would seem to me that my function is manipulating certain objects.
[12:20:33] <Velveeta> trupheenix: i've been trying to read some more into push/popstate, but i'm not coming up with anything immediately helpfulâ€¦ there is a concept of passing by value or reference, but it's not something you can specify at runtime, or alter, it's based on data type
[12:20:43] <ya> Velveeta: do you know why that could be?!
[12:20:46] <Velveeta> all objects are passed by reference, primitives are passed by value
[12:21:07] <trupheenix> Velveeta, ah… that explains it.
[12:21:25] <trupheenix> Velveeta, so if the object is associated with a JQuery listener, that also might be getting changed in my case here.
[12:22:31] <Velveeta> ya: not off the top of my head, are you requesting the url by "list" or by "/list" ?
[12:22:40] <ya>  /list
[12:22:42] <Velveeta> trupheenix: definitely
[12:23:11] <trupheenix> Velveeta, so that is what is happening
[12:23:24] <Velveeta> sounds like it
[12:23:46] <trupheenix> Velveeta, now tell me, in Chrome, is there anyway to see what objects are being passed to my function being called on a button which has a click listener associated with it?
[12:24:28] <Velveeta> trupheenix: you can set a breakpoint in the debugger and hover over your variable name, it'll pop up a thing that shows you the object itself
[12:24:35] <Velveeta> ya: i'm investigating your issue right now btw
[12:28:00] <Velveeta> ya: i'm getting a 500 server error
[12:28:27] <Velveeta> aha, here's the problem
[12:28:37] <trupheenix> ?
[12:28:41] <Velveeta> it looks like you're cancelling and resubmitting the request immediately
[12:28:49] <Velveeta> trupheenix: that was for ya, not you :)
[12:29:11] <trupheenix> ya is such a convenient nick name ;)
[12:30:32] <Velveeta> ya: nope, scratch that, i'm getting a 500 server error
[12:33:11] <trupheenix> Velveeta, is there an easy way to create a copy of an object?
[12:34:11] <Velveeta> trupheenix: var newObject = $.extend({}, oldObject);
[12:34:39] <trupheenix> Velveeta, so this will essentially create a copy of the oldObject. It won't be a reference.
[12:34:46] <Velveeta> rightio
[12:34:54] <trupheenix> Velveeta, sounds like what I need to do then
[12:35:03] <Velveeta> it's commonly used when you want to return an object from something without the caller mucking with its state
[12:35:20] <trupheenix> Velveeta, ah.. I get it. Just what I require.
[12:35:41] <Velveeta> if you look at something like jquery ui's option method, and just call like $(dialog).dialog('option') to get the current option settings, it returns $.extend({}, this.options) to prevent that
[12:35:50] <ya> Velveeta: ?? you get 500 on http://publicdomainworks.net/list?query=piano ?
[12:36:52] <Velveeta> ya: if i call it on its own from the browser, i get a json response, but if i call it via .ajax, i get a 500 error
[12:36:53] <Boggie> Dummy question :) .text() only works to set and retrieve the text values for non form elements, correct? :)
[12:37:04] <ya> Velveeta: why???
[12:37:22] <ya> Velveeta: and why does "query=pianist" or anything else works fine?!
[12:37:36] <Velveeta> i can't say why, it's a server-side error
[12:37:56] <Velveeta> boggie: yep, if you want to set the value of a form element, use .val()
[12:38:13] <ya> Velveeta: but.... i dont understand.. it's the same request, no ?
[12:38:35] <Boggie> and retrieving a form element value would be .val() as well? Just parsing over the API now :)
[12:38:41] <Velveeta> yep, but if your server is somehow treating ajax requests vs standard requests differently, there chould be something throwing an error in that
[12:39:13] <Velveeta> the full argument list i'm getting in your success function shows a timeout
[12:39:19] <Velveeta> but the request itself errors out with a 500
[12:40:21] <ya> aaah funny
[12:40:22] <ya> :D
[12:40:29] <ya> my ajax request was on timeout:3000
[12:40:40] <ya> so it was returning NoneType
[12:41:05] <Velveeta> ahhhhhh ok
[12:44:22] <trupheenix> Velveeta, yipee! problem solved.
[12:44:40] <Velveeta> good to hear :) was it just the object being mutated by some listener?
[12:44:46] <trupheenix> Velveeta, yes
[12:45:14] <Velveeta> nice
[12:45:26] <Velveeta> always nice when it's a quick and easy fix vs a refactor
[12:45:43] <trupheenix> Velveeta, thanks a lot
[12:45:51] <trupheenix> Velveeta, I can go to SLEEEEEEP now. :)
[12:46:02] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[12:48:41] <Boggie> Velveeta, also thank you for the hint, hopefully this trick solves the rather newbie thing I am working on.
[12:48:42] <Boggie> :D
[12:50:22] <Velveeta> boggie: which hint was that? :)
[12:51:42] <Boggie> with the .val() :) I am trying to work on a simple thing, use a hidden textbox to change a value of another html element :). Right now i am at the point where I get an 'undefined' returned when I try to check the text box's value :)
[12:51:58] <Boggie> but I will try to work and figure it on my own.
[12:52:12] <Velveeta> gotcha, good luck :)
[12:52:31] <Boggie> Thanks.
[12:54:13] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[12:56:18] <ya> Validatorian: !!
[12:56:22] <ya> actually... there is an issue
[12:56:36] <ya> $(document).on('click', '.calc',  precalc);
[12:56:42] <ya> this is good, except that
[12:57:49] <ya> on every generated <i class="calc" rdf="http://some.url.to/rdf.xml">
[12:58:00] <ya> i want the function precalc to be given that rdf attribute
[12:58:03] <ya> how can i achieve that ?
[12:59:17] <Velveeta> well, first, you shouldn't use nonstandard attributes like that, but as part of html5, we received support for custom attributes, which you can prepend with data-â€¦ so make that rdf attribute data-rdf instead, and within your callback, you can reference: $(this).data('rdf')â€¦ 'this' will be a pointer to the element that was clicked
[13:01:43] <ya> hmm
[13:02:43] <ya> Velveeta: i mean, you said that i cannot bind the function precalc to the elements before i generate them
[13:02:46] <ya> right ?
[13:02:54] <Velveeta> right, you don't have to
[13:03:04] <Velveeta> using that delegated method, 'this' will still point to your element
[13:03:10] <ya> ooh
[13:03:42] <ya> $(document).on('click', '.calc',  precalc($(this).data('rdf')); would automatically refer to the clicked one?
[13:03:56] <Velveeta> nope, within precalc itself you would do that
[13:04:06] <ya> aah
[13:04:38] <Velveeta> so you'd have: function precalc() { var rdf = $(this).data('rdf'); // other stuff }, and then you'd just pass precalc as your click handler like normal
[13:11:49] <ya> cool
[13:11:51] <ya> thx :D
[14:24:58] <aeroraver> can someone help me with a script, i
[14:25:31] <aeroraver> i am trying to make a multilevel list that automaticaly closes siblings on the same level when a new node is opened
[14:37:42] <doug65536> aeroraver: fiddle?
[14:38:07] <doug65536> aeroraver: what you want should be easy
[14:38:54] <doug65536> aeroraver: are you hiding the children using css or "manually" with all js?
[14:38:55] <aeroraver> doug: well i've been trying in fiddle for a while now, but in the end it comes down to the parent closing when i want to toggle a child
[14:39:22] <aeroraver> doug: i hide every child with css
[14:39:56] <doug65536> aeroraver: ok, so you just want to maintain a constraint that only one item doesn't have the "hide children" class, right?
[14:40:39] <doug65536> aeroraver: can you link the fiddle?
[14:40:48] <aeroraver> sure one sec
[14:41:03] <aeroraver> doug: http://jsfiddle.net/aeroraver/4b3uM/
[14:41:21] <aeroraver> doug: i just started from scratch again so there's not much there atm
[14:43:18] <doug65536> bug is clicking level 2 closes level 1?
[14:45:15] <doug65536> aeroraver: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4b3uM/2/
[14:46:29] <aeroraver> doug: yeah that was the bug, and appearantly the fix was pretty easy
[14:46:48] <doug65536> yeah, bug was it was hiding EVERY ul.expandable
[14:47:01] <doug65536> I made it just hide the siblings, and stopped the event from bubbling up
[14:47:14] <aeroraver> doug: though your script also contains a bug
[14:48:03] <doug65536> aeroraver: what?
[14:48:21] <doug65536> you want to be able to collapse an item by clicking it again?
[14:49:11] <aeroraver> doug: yeah, that's pretty much it, it now opens again if you toggle it
[14:50:09] <Richhh> i want to hide a div when the user clicks off of it, using $(document).on('click',function(){ /*...*/ }); breaks the button that shows the div
[14:51:03] <aeroraver> doug: though i guess that isn't really that important, for what i want to do this is fine
[14:52:13] <Crucials> Richhh: You could add an if() in there to check if its the button that was clicked or not
[14:53:13] <doug65536> Crucials: it already stops propagation so it's always the one that is clicked
[14:54:00] <Crucials> doug65536: not sure I get it
[14:55:43] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4b3uM/5/
[14:55:49] <doug65536> too bad he left
[14:56:35] <doug65536> Crucials: you understand event bubbling right?
[14:58:19] <doug65536> Crucials: it uses event.target to get the actual one that was clicked, and stops propagation so it won't bubble through its parents, so it won't get any event callbacks for anything that wasn't the actual one clicked
[14:58:27] <Crucials> I thought so. Something to do with child elements triggering events of parents?
[14:58:46] <Richhh> Crucials: how can i know that?
[14:59:15] <doug65536> Crucials: ah sorry, you weren't talking to me. doh!
[14:59:33] <Richhh> event.target huh?
[15:00:24] <GoSox> I'm trying to use this command, to "disable" an input, but it's not working. I'm not getting any error messages, and commands before and after this work, but this seems to do nothing
[15:00:27] <GoSox> $("#gzip_url").prop('disabled', true);
[15:00:43] <Richhh> i guess i use event.preventDefault(), gonna try
[15:00:52] <doug65536> Richhh: try doing if ($(event.target).is(theToggle)) return;
[15:01:12] <doug65536> where "theToggle" is the thing that shows it. you follow?
[15:01:45] <GoSox> oh nevermind i'm just dumb
[15:01:46] <GoSox> :D
[15:01:51] <Richhh> ok
[15:01:55] <doug65536> sorry, I thought crucials was talking to me because aeroraver's problem was bubbling related :)
[15:02:02] <doug65536> so I confused things :)
[15:02:05] <Richhh> np
[15:02:11] <evilbug> GoSox: fancy seeing you here.
[15:02:16] <GoSox> GAH!!!!
[15:02:18] <Crucials> doug65536: oh okay! I was getting really confused
[15:02:20] <GoSox> STALKER!!
[15:02:23] <GoSox> STRANGER DANGER!!
[15:02:33] <Velveeta> i need an adult!
[15:02:36] <evilbug> GoSox: want to visit my basement?
[15:02:50] <GoSox> and if there are puppies and/or candy
[15:02:53] <GoSox> only if*
[15:04:08] <evilbug> those are in my unmarked van.
[15:04:27] <Richhh> doug65536: worked, thanks :)
[15:04:35] <doug65536> np
[15:04:47] <doug65536> why is it that native code irc channels are full of jerks?
[15:05:08] <doug65536> people think they are god because they know C++? big whoop
[15:05:58] <GoSox> #php is notoriously the worst
[15:06:12] <Velveeta> the channel or the language?
[15:06:16] <doug65536> same with opengl channel. so what if you know C++ and some linear algebra. it's called a normal education. get over yourself :D
[15:06:17] <GoSox> the channel
[15:06:21] <GoSox> the langauge is the best!
[15:06:36] <Velveeta> i don't know that i'd call it the best, but it's definitely easy to jump right in and learn
[15:06:55] <Velveeta> and its advances in the last 5 years have definitely made it a first-class citizen of programming
[15:07:00] <GoSox> for server-side web programming, i would call it the best
[15:07:26] <GoSox> for shell scripting, i use it, but mainly because all my shell scripts are web-related and most connect to mysql
[15:07:45] <Velveeta> i use it for shell scripting myself sometimes, mostly because it's a lot easier to write than bash script :D
[15:07:49] <Velveeta> and intuitive
[15:07:50] <doug65536> GoSox:  I dunno... if you are good at js, node can handle way more traffic with a much smaller machine
[15:08:06] <GoSox> but
[15:08:09] <GoSox> js is a terrible language
[15:08:10] <GoSox> :)
[15:08:11] <Velveeta> i'm loving watching node improve and slowly make its mark in the web world
[15:08:16] <Velveeta> js is not a terrible language whatsoever
[15:08:20] <doug65536> GoSox: :O
[15:08:26] <Velveeta> people that say that don't know how to elegantly write javascript
[15:08:49] <doug65536> GoSox: the more js you learn, the more you realize that it is a brilliant language
[15:08:55] <Velveeta> absolutely
[15:09:02] <GoSox> well clearly i haven't gotten to that point yet
[15:09:08] <Velveeta> i used to think of it as just a scripting language you could do some neato stuff with
[15:09:13] <GoSox> i use it for one reason... its the only choice for client-side programming
[15:09:24] <Velveeta> the more and more advanced i get, the more i realize just how elegant and flexible of a language it is
[15:09:36] <Velveeta> it's not the *only* choice, there's always actionscript
[15:09:47] <Velveeta> it's an extension of ecmascript, but not js at least
[15:09:52] <Velveeta> there's silverlight
[15:09:56] <Velveeta> if you like wcf
[15:11:31] <GoSox> i use js, and i think i'm pretty good at it. i make some nice stuff. but i still very much prefer coding in php
[15:11:42] <GoSox> sure, the function naming is a little crazy but
[15:11:47] <GoSox> other than that, i love php
[15:12:13] <Velveeta> so i say it's completely up to the tasks you're performing on the server
[15:12:32] <Velveeta> node is great at async operations like disk I/O, db retrievals, etc
[15:12:40] <Velveeta> but it's not super at cpu-intensive operations
[15:13:12] <Velveeta> i prefer it as a middlware api layerâ€¦ it can handle any async operations itself, and offload any cpu-intensive tasks to a proper back end server running php or some .net variant
[15:13:40] <Velveeta> and then those languages can multithread and do any computational magic they require and funnel the response back through node to the client
[15:13:41] <doug65536> node opens up a lot of possibilities that aren't directly feasible in php. in php, at the end of the request, your code "forgets" everything. in node, you can do caching of work that isn't possible in php, and you can avoid reinitializing things every single time that you would have to do in php
[15:15:04] <doug65536> you can "simulate" it with something like memcached to some extent, but it's not as completely open-ended as what you can do in node
[15:15:59] <Velveeta> another problem i've experience w/ memcached is cache invalidationâ€¦ it's hard to know what you have available because it doesn't have a list of keyed entries for things you've stored, you have to maintain your own and manually augment it everytime you store something
[15:16:45] <Velveeta> it's doable, it's just more difficult than just storing in memory in your application and invalidating it there using a native object map
[15:18:47] <Velveeta> we don't sound like we're tagteaming him do we?
[15:18:52] <Velveeta> because that's not the intent
[15:22:51] <doug65536> neither of us said "php sucks", I was just pointing out that there are alternatives that trade off some of php's ease of use for more power
[15:24:13] <Velveeta> and i came in partway through that conversation and was just throwing out my own opinions of both languages, and good uses for each of them
[15:24:38] <Velveeta> plus i'm a few beers in already
[15:24:43] <Velveeta> so i'm overly PC
[15:25:17] <doug65536> if js was still a bytecode interpreter, I might complain about performance, but with V8's amazing native code generator, I lean heavily toward node right now
[15:25:42] <Velveeta> and with asm.js, js is soon gonna be on its way to native performance ;)
[15:25:55] <doug65536> php is very fast for being interpreted, but it's not fair performance wise against a JIT compiler
[15:26:05] <Velveeta> not to mention just the more mature environment we're finding ourselves in these days, with proper development patterns being utilized, and scalable web app consideration
[15:26:06] <Velveeta> s
[15:27:17] <Velveeta> yeah when i used to do php development, we paired it with both memcached and APC to clean up some of its performance shortfalls, and it worked.. i wrote a codebase that literally powered about 4000 different websites off of a single deployment directory on 1 box, with all site settings being pulled and rendered from the db
[15:27:38] <doug65536> I can't really measure the maximum number of clients on localhost in node - it's so fast that it runs out of ports because all of the requests are coming from the same address
[15:28:12] <Velveeta> are you using it to funnel through to a back end service layer?
[15:28:43] <doug65536> no, it's doing everything (db access and page generation)
[15:29:29] <Velveeta> then what do you mean when you say "it runs out of ports because all of the requests are coming from the same address" ?
[15:29:29] <doug65536> normally, it would never run out of ports because there would be many source addresses, but if I try to stress it with "ab" or something, all the requests come from the same address
[15:29:46] <Velveeta> i assumed you meant a back end service layer was clogged up with requests from the node layer, a single address
[15:29:54] <doug65536> a socket is identified by serverIP+serverport+clientip+clientport
[15:29:56] <Velveeta> ahhhhhh i gotcha
[15:30:06] <Velveeta> right, i didn't know you meant ab testing
[15:30:10] <doug65536> yeah
[15:30:19] <Velveeta> i just thought you had a really popular web service :D
[15:30:31] <doug65536> not yet :D
[15:31:15] <Velveeta> i'm working on a ground-up project of my own, and right from the start i'm going w/ the API-first mentality to construct the client experience from, so that in the future i can just sell it as SaaS
[15:31:24] <Velveeta> and let any number of clients just consume the api layer
[15:31:49] <Velveeta> plus, it means i can completely decouple the front end from the back end and use whatever flavor of the month technology i want on the client :)
[15:33:30] <doug65536> your API extends partially onto the client though right? you are going to write an layer of client side ajax that wraps the server requests?
[15:33:43] <doug65536> client side js*
[15:34:12] <Velveeta> well my object models on the client side will be coupled to the API itself, yes, they'll need to know what endpoints to call back to
[15:35:03] <Velveeta> but it's gonna be just data transmissions back and forth, nothing consumable, so that the json response can be consumed by a web client, or native ios, or android, or whatever
[15:35:45] <doug65536> planning on making it RESTful?
[15:35:53] <Velveeta> that's absolutely what it is :)
[15:36:06] <Velveeta> the authorization layer was the first task i worked on from the node side
[15:36:20] <Velveeta> so it's just header credentials that are handled by node middleware functions for confirmation
[15:37:16] <doug65536> how do you "route" the requests? something like express or a custom solution?
[15:37:41] <Velveeta> yeah right now i'm using express.. i shopped around, and considered brainy.io for a hot minute, but i'm more familiar w/ express
[15:39:05] <doug65536> I've done everything "by hand" so far, coding directly against httpServer. probably not the best idea but I'm trying to optimize for extremely low latency and extreme scalability
[15:39:15] <Velveeta> nice
[15:39:18] <doug65536> I should probably seriously look at express soon though for future work
[15:39:26] <Velveeta> you're braver than i :D node is still on a learning curve for me
[15:39:47] <Velveeta> i can say that incorporating Q into that workflow has been a lifesaver
[15:40:11] <doug65536> yeah, when you're working with the raw apis, it feels more like C than js. you need to write a fair bit of code like you would in C
[15:40:12] <Velveeta> i wrote an abstraction layer around my mysql module to return promises for the query results, which has made that portion of it a snap
[15:41:21] <doug65536> like that, "uh, I have to parse the POST request body stream manually?" moment :D
[15:41:38] <Velveeta> heheheh
[15:41:48] <Velveeta> yeah in express, i can just say "req.param('myVar')" :D
[15:43:20] <zer0s> Is there anyway I can correct this script to show the alert?
[15:43:27] <zer0s> http://pastebin.com/mjZQvwPz
[15:43:43] <doug65536> it's pretty cool though, I made it cache the gzipped data and hash it, so I can ETag everything and 304 everything when appropriate
[15:44:44] <Velveeta> zer0s: i can't see anything wrong with it immediately
[15:45:11] <dj21> can i check if a tab/window's history has n forward or n backward?
[15:45:12] <Velveeta> though i can say that inside of your $(form1) block, you could reference $(this) instead of $('form')
[15:45:39] <doug65536> $(form1).ready ???
[15:46:12] <doug65536> a form won't get a ready event will it?
[15:46:25] <Velveeta> dj21: looks like window.history.length is an available option, but i don't think it'll tell you where you are in that list to be able to determine how many are forward and how many are back from your current state
[15:46:26] <zer0s> o_o
[15:46:38] <Velveeta> oh shit, i missed the .ready() part
[15:46:43] <Velveeta> no, forms don't receive a ready event
[15:46:45] <doug65536> zer0s: shouldn't that be $(document).ready ...
[15:46:55] <zer0s> yes
[15:46:58] <zer0s> lol
[15:47:05] <Velveeta> feexed!
[15:47:13] <zer0s> let me try it
[15:48:09] <zer0s> uhh
[15:48:21] <zer0s> it still doesn't show the alert
[15:48:22] <zer0s> @_@
[15:48:30] <doug65536> zer0s: also, you probably need to make line 2 say function(event){     and do event.preventDefault()
[15:48:38] <doug65536> oops, line 4
[15:48:59] <doug65536> the page will reload since submit will reload
[15:49:05] <doug65536> without event.preventDefault
[15:49:21] <doug65536> your $.post won't even finish without it
[15:49:48] <doug65536> ah... the return false might do that though
[15:50:07] <doug65536> the indentation threw me off
[15:50:13] <Velveeta> yeah it would
[15:50:14] <zer0s> sorry about the indention
[15:51:19] <doug65536> zer0s: have you had a look at the Network tab in the debugger?
[15:51:29] <doug65536> does the POST return 200 OK or what
[15:51:41] <zer0s> hold on
[15:51:45] <zer0s> let me look
[15:52:34] <dj21> yeah that won't work then.  so close.
[15:53:20] <zer0s> doug65536, yes
[15:53:30] <Velveeta> dj21: you can try adding an index value to your state object that gets stored in the history object, and check that index against the other history items
[15:53:41] <Velveeta> try to figure out your own location in that stack
[15:53:52] <zer0s> POST 302 found, GET 200 0K
[15:54:34] <doug65536> zer0s: 302 is a redirect
[15:54:38] <Velveeta> i was about to say
[15:55:22] <zer0s> Is there something I can do about the redirect?
[15:55:25] <zer0s> o_o
[15:55:35] <zer0s> I just need it to push the form to another php page
[15:55:44] <Velveeta> my initial response would be "stop redirecting" :D
[15:55:44] <doug65536> zer0s: try changing your $.post line to this: $.post($form.attr('action'), $form.serialize(), null, 'json').done(function() { alert("added"); }).fail(function() { alert('oh crap'); })
[15:55:48] <Velveeta> but that sounds like an asshole response
[15:56:24] <zer0s> Velveeta, to be honest I know practically nothing about jquery and only slightly more about javascript
[15:56:34] <Velveeta> well 302's happen server-side
[15:56:38] <Velveeta> so it's nothing that jquery is doing
[15:57:06] <doug65536> my guess is the browser isn't resending the post to the new address, my guess is the domain changed and it refuses to
[15:57:24] <doug65536> in any case, my suggested change will at least alert "oh crap" if there was an error returned by the post
[15:57:36] <zer0s> lol
[15:57:40] <zer0s> thanks doug65536 !
[15:58:01] <zer0s> thank you Velveeta also
[15:58:11] <Velveeta> i wasn't much help, but you're welcome :)
[15:58:20] <doug65536> wild guess: your action doesn't have www. or something silly
[15:58:32] <zer0s> nope
[15:58:39] <zer0s> its just "cart.php"
[15:58:58] <doug65536> hmmm
[16:00:10] <doug65536> hey, does the php code do header('Location: <something...>') ??
[16:00:15] <doug65536> in that code path
[16:00:37] <vire> pls guys is there a pretty straightforward way to load jquery and execute the script that has jq as dep first when (window.$) is true?
[16:00:51] <doug65536> zer0s: perhaps, before the $.post line, add: alert('gonna post...')
[16:01:01] <zer0s> ah
[16:01:06] <zer0s> i'll try that
[16:01:47] <zer0s> doug65536, that worked
[16:01:48] <zer0s> lol
[16:01:49] <zer0s> hahahaha
[16:02:01] <doug65536> zer0s: did you try the .done / .fail suggestion I made earlier?
[16:02:24] <zer0s> actually i was about to
[16:02:32] <zer0s> but you suggested something much simpler
[16:02:38] <doug65536>  $.post($form.attr('action'), $form.serialize(), null, 'json').done(function() { alert("added"); }).fail(function() { alert('oh crap'); })
[16:02:48] <zer0s> moving the alert to before the post
[16:03:00] <doug65536> that should alert 'oh crap' if the browser refused the 302
[16:03:23] <doug65536> just to prove that the XHR request really is failing
[16:03:28] <Velveeta> vire: just put the jquery script tag first in line..
[16:03:37] <Velveeta> it'll block other scripts from loading until it's done
[16:03:40] <zer0s> doug65536, i'll try that too
[16:03:49] <zer0s> but as it is, its working great
[16:03:51] <zer0s> :D
[16:04:25] <doug65536> zer0s: it alerts('added to cart') now?
[16:04:33] <zer0s> yes!
[16:04:39] <doug65536> ok cool
[16:04:54] <zer0s> Thank so much! really I am very greatful
[16:04:55] <zer0s> :)
[16:04:56] <doug65536> np
[16:05:04] <doug65536> I thought it still wasn't working :)
[16:06:18] <zer0s> nope!
[16:08:17] <tw2113> Velveeta, the Smithsonian wrote about you http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/there-is-no-shortage-history-when-it-comes-velveeta-180949312/
[16:08:24] <Velveeta> lol
[16:08:44] <Velveeta> seriously, my twitter account was blowing up that week when everybody went apeshit over a velveeta shortage
[16:09:11] <doug65536> lol I just pictured you laying in the dairy fridge at the supermarket
[16:09:25] <Velveeta> :D
[16:09:35] <tw2113> this is the first i've heard of it
[16:10:27] <Velveeta> not me, i heard about it before anybody else i knew, because people were tweeting their rage in my general direction :D
[16:10:28] <tw2113> so this is you? https://twitter.com/velveeta
[16:10:30] <tw2113> they haven't contacted you yet with money to buy the account?
[16:10:39] <Velveeta> yeah that's me, and no, they haven't contacted me
[16:10:44] <tw2113> shame
[16:10:55] <Velveeta> i threw the offer out there jokingly one day, and i got a nastygram from twitter saying you're not allowed to try to sell your acct
[16:10:59] <doug65536> more like lawyers to force it from you
[16:11:01] <Velveeta> and that if i tried again, they'd shut me down
[16:11:13] <Velveeta> so far no team of lawyers either, thankfully :)
[16:11:21] <tw2113> that's why you contact the cheese company directly
[16:11:23] <doug65536> kraft goons come to your door to "have a little talk 'bout the account"
[16:11:38] <Velveeta> funnily enough, @kraft doesn't belong to kraft either :D
[16:11:43] <Velveeta> it's another web nerd from the same city as me
[16:11:53] <tw2113> conspiracy
[16:12:17] <Velveeta> apparently
[16:12:59] <tw2113> ha, @kraft is a WordPress guy
[16:13:56] <doug65536> I wonder if there is an account called "TwitterSucks"
[16:15:33] <doug65536> there is! there is @twittersucks and @twitterdoessuck
[16:16:50] <Velveeta> heheheh
[16:17:05] <Velveeta> yeah, me and kraft were bouncing messages off of each other during the velveeta shortagemania
[16:19:37] <vire> Velveeta, thx for the tip, i am gonna try, i workin on a chrom extension, and in the content script Iam injecting jquery in the selected tab, then i am trying to manipulate the DOM but some times it dosnt work and yield $ to undefined
[16:20:36] <Velveeta> vire: if you're injecting the script, it's gonna load asynchronously, you can either use a dependency manager like requirejs to control your callback, or else attach an onload event listener to the script tag
[16:20:42] <doug65536> vire: how are you injecting it? appending a script tag?
[16:20:56] <doug65536> vire, yeah, what velveeta said
[16:23:35] <doug65536> vire: not sure what you would put for data-main if you injected require.js in an extension. attaching an onload event listener to a script tag seems simpler
[16:24:10] <frewsxcv> I'm writing a jQuery plugin. If I require the document to be loaded for the plugin to work, should I just specify to the user of the plugin they need to invoke it within document.ready or should use document.ready within my plugin?
[16:24:39] <doug65536> frewsxcv: using document.ready in your plugin is almost free and always works. I would do that
[16:24:59] <Velveeta> yeah i would do it that way also
[16:25:08] <Velveeta> leaves any guesswork out, and you don't rely on them for boilerplate code
[16:25:44] <vire> Velveeta,  yeah i am puting it via (document.head || document.documentElement).appendChild(scriptElem);
[16:26:48] <vire> Velveeta, pls how does this work? else attach an onload event listener to the script tag
[16:26:55] <Velveeta> yeah, so you'll need to either attach an onload listener to it to trigger your callback, or else use a dependency manager of some kind
[16:27:38] <Velveeta> var script = document.createElement('yourScriptUrl'); // append to head; script.onload = yourCallbackFunction;
[16:28:00] <doug65536> vire: right before you do that line you showed, do: scriptElem.onload = function() { ... do all your stuff here, jquery is loaded now ... }
[16:32:54] <vire> cool
[16:34:14] <vire> gonna test it, the buggy thing is, that on 9of10 webpages it works, only gmail or g.calendar disturbes the loading process, on a normal page myscript.js get exectued without any problems
[16:39:15] <doug65536> vire you should probably do a jQuery.noConflict in the onload... you might be clobbering $
[16:39:35] <basiclaser> so my task at hand is to set up a webstore for restarant that wants to allow home delivery, only up to 6km from the restaurant
[16:41:12] <vire> doug65536, definitley, casu google call uses some internal $* functions like in this file https://www.google.com/calendar/static/b48ea25b8a08304099b86c959b2ebc22calendarjs_doozercompiled__sk.js
[16:52:47] <hfp> Hi guys, I would like to encode a string to HTML (I think). What I would like is turn 'Some awesome string with Ã© and >' into 'Some%20awesome%20string%20with%20&eacute;%20and%20&gt;'. I had a look at .html() but it doesn't seem to work, I get a TypeError that the thing I am calling .html() on is not a function. What am I missing?
[17:04:22] <doug65536> hfp: encodeURLComponent
[17:04:40] <doug65536> hfp: but what you want' doesn't make sense either
[17:04:46] <doug65536> hfp: why &gt;
[17:05:55] <Crucials> isnt that the symbol for >
[17:06:05] <doug65536> hfp: not in url encoding
[17:06:23] <doug65536> hfp: what you want is encodeURLComponent (it's a JS function)
[17:09:55] <hfp> Ok this is what I am trying to do: I have a contact form that sends me an email via Ajax and displays a message on success. It also handles errors and displays a message if something went wrong. I would like the user to be able to click a mailto: link in case of an error that will still allow them to send the email if they have an email client installed. To save them from retyping the whole message, I am using .append() to alter the
[17:09:56] <hfp> mailto: link and add &body=whatever%20they%20typed
[17:10:16] <hfp> But I am confused whether I need HTML encoding or URL encoding
[17:10:30] <doug65536> .append won't alter a tag
[17:10:46] <hfp> Yes, I'm actually adding the href tag with .append
[17:10:48] <doug65536> it's an 'a' tag right?
[17:10:51] <doug65536> ok
[17:10:52] <hfp> Yes
[17:11:21] <doug65536> do this: $(whatever...).append($('<a/>').attr('href', theLink))
[17:11:27] <doug65536> attr will do everything right
[17:11:52] <doug65536> theLink's body=<whatever> would need encodeURLComponent on the <whatever> part
[17:11:59] <doug65536> make sense?
[17:12:09] <hfp> It does, thanks
[17:13:27] <hfp> is it encodeURIComponent or URL?
[17:13:45] <doug65536> URI
[17:13:46] <doug65536> sorry
[17:15:20] <hfp> Ok thanks
[17:19:10] <hfp> doug65536: Awesome, you just solved what I was stuck on for the last 2 hours, thanks again!
[17:20:36] <doug65536> hfp: np
[18:53:23] <evilbug> i have a script that moves an element around based on browser width and although the script technically works, it doesn't work on first load. i have to manually resize the browser a bit and then the script pops into place.
[18:54:44] <doug65536> evilbug: try adding $(window).trigger('resize') at the end of initialization
[18:56:43] <evilbug> doug65536: yes! thanks for that.

[19:14:55] <ShawnRisk> decx:hi?
[19:31:45] <floatingpoint> so does it make sense to define new global vars as needed, or should they be allocated at the top of a JS file?
[19:32:11] <svetlana> (Re-sent from ##javascript, but this may have interesting jQuery solutions) What would you recommend me to do with AJAX calls? Is there a way to stop branching out? Look for "Clean up article page" at https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gryllida/common.js and the next 5 lines. (Nested AJAX .dones, which is ugly)
[19:38:50] <fattest> someone please help with my bootstrap collapse. I want it to open animate on page load. http://jsfiddle.net/2Y3DC/24/
[19:40:20] <shoky> svetlana http://pastie.org/8646816
[19:40:38] <svetlana> shoky, ?
[19:40:55] <shoky> er didnt see there's another 2 levels
[19:41:55] <svetlana> I'd be surprised if the return works at all. foo(); ajax.done(return bar;).fail(..);baz(); -- Id expect such function to only do foo and baz and exit, and the ajax thing be done somewhere separate in a separate thread.
[19:42:48] <shoky> i used .then  not .done
[19:47:37] <svetlana> shocky: i'm just tempted to use labels. ajax(... 1.... ).then(goto: 2;); 2: ajax(... 2...).then(goto: 3;);
[19:48:03] <svetlana> I'm trying to resist the need to branch out.
[19:48:05] <snover> ajax().then(function(){ return ajax(); }).then(function(){ return ajax(); }) should work except if i recall correctly jquery has a braindead promises implementation that doesnâ€™t allow you to do that
[19:48:56] <svetlana> snover: you're right.
[19:49:57] <svetlana> .when is a bit interesting ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3709597/wait-until-all-jquery-ajax-request-are-done )
[19:50:13] <shoky> svetlana something like http://pastebin.com/ptz0WQ6X
[20:00:56] <fattest> How do i make my bootstrap collapse expand animate open automatically? http://jsfiddle.net/2Y3DC/24/
[20:09:00] <teufelChiCoder> hi, got an array of date strings, how can i change their format?

[20:39:58] <execv> how can I unload or remove an element? I'm using the query plugin sprtespin (loaded like: $('.element').spritespin(); ). I want to toggle a div to use this plugin on click. I can load it on click, but how can I remove it/unload it?
[20:40:29] <teufelChiCoder> hi, got an array of date strings, how can i change their format?
[20:40:29] <teufelChiCoder> this is what it comes out as now: ["Sat Jan 18 2014 22:09:13 GMT-0600 (CST)", "Sat Jan 18 2014 22:09:13 GMT-0600 (CST)", "Sat Jan 18 2014 22:09:13 GMT-0600 (CST)", "Sat Jan 18 2014 22:09:13 GMT-0600 (CST)", "Sat Jan 18 2014 22:09:13 GMT-0600 (CST)", "Sat Jan 18 2014 22:09:13 GMT-0600 (CST)"], i just want to change fomat to mm/dd/yy
[21:00:07] <Seich_> teufelChiCoder: you could go over each and create a  date object
[21:01:03] <Seich> teufelChiCoder: and then use that object to format them
[21:01:33] <teufelChiCoder> Selchâ€¦can you explain some more?
[21:02:08] <teufelChiCoder> i get that array when i run $("#divBlock").data("dates").map(Date)
[21:18:04] <tables> $('#summary').text(my_var);        how can i show html instead?
[21:18:07] <tables> i'm new to jquery
[21:18:18] <tables> i'm sending text to #summary i think, i want to send html
[21:18:23] <tables> send it as html*
[21:24:42] <teufelChiCoder> seich
[21:31:12] <Seich_> teufelChiCoder: well, you can iterate over the array
[21:31:32] <Seich_> and then create a new date object like new Date(date);
[21:32:00] <Seich_> I'll create a fiddle, one sec
[21:32:12] <teufelChiCoder> Seich thank you
[21:35:40] <tables> $('#summary').text(my_var);        //how can i show html instead?
[21:35:43] <tables> it only shows text
[21:35:45] <tables> to #summary
[21:36:23] <Seich_> teufelChiCoder: something like this: http://jsbin.com/oNexuMA/1/
[21:36:51] <seich> hopefully that clears it up.
[21:37:49] <seich> tables: my_var is html? and you want to insert it into another element? is that right?
[21:39:37] <teufelChiCoder> seich thank you very much
[21:39:44] <teufelChiCoder> learning something new everyday
[21:40:10] <seich> teufelChiCoder: :) I am glad to be of service.
[21:41:39] <tables> seich, yea
[21:41:40] <teufelChiCoder> seich for the year - why does it say 114?
[21:41:52] <tables> i have <div id="summary"></div>    i want html in that div
[21:41:55] <tables> from my_var of course
[21:50:30] <seich> teufelChiCoder: oh, yeah, use getFullYear() instead
[21:50:35] <seich> that'lll return 2014
[21:51:07] <seich> getYear is going to be deprecated or might be already, I am not sure
[21:51:07] <seich> x)
[21:52:29] <seich> tables: alright, give me one sec
[21:54:17] <seich> tables, to do that you can use the .html method instead of .text
[21:54:24] <seich> like: $summary.html(my_var);
[21:54:32] <tables> thanks
[21:54:36] <seich> :) np
[21:54:53] <tables> could i do
[21:55:05] <tables> $('#summary').html(my_var);
[21:55:06] <tables> ?
[21:55:18] <tables> why is it $summary.html(my_var); ?
[21:56:12] <seich> yeah, of course xD
[21:56:38] <seich> $summary is my way of abbreviating var $summary = $('#summary')
[21:56:48] <seich> I am lazy like that sometimes x)
[22:33:13] <tonythomas01> I want  to add a .click(function( ){ close()) to a jquery object $this.overlay. I am a beginner. Can someone help ?
[22:34:15] <svetlana> From your description, it sounds like "$this.overlay.click(function( ){ close());" would work. Although I don't know what "$this.overlay" is.
[22:35:21] <tonythomas01> svetlana: $this.overlay is defined in another file as a $this.overlay =('div').addclass('somename' );
[22:39:06] <tonythomas01> svetlana: Can I have something like the funciton be attached to $this.overlay after it has executed the $this.overlay = ('div').addClass('foo') from the other file ?
[22:42:21] <svetlana> Sure, just place one after the other.
[22:42:50] <tonythomas01> svetlana: but the problem is I need the click function in another file
[22:43:16] <svetlana> Import it.
[22:43:23] <tonythomas01> the file which is a subclass of the file that has the $this.overlay = ('div')
[22:43:30] <tonythomas01> svetlana: Import?
[22:43:54] <tonythomas01> if it is a subclass, should import be needed ?
[23:14:24] <frewsxcv> If I have an jQuery object wrapping an element, is it possible to set the css psuedo property :after for it?
