[00:12:34] <ThomQ> Hi all. I got a little bit of a dillema. I build this app in LUA, running on my pc, and I need it to somehow trigger a function in jquery on a locally hosted webpage. What would be some possible solutions?
[00:13:04] <ThomQ> I am also asking this to LUA people, but I´d like to get yall´s perspective too
[01:44:41] <kutenai> does a call to $.ajax with cache:true cause an exception if the requested data is in the cache?
[01:47:14] <rcyr> kutenai: Pretty sure it's ignore when true because that's the default.
[01:47:36] <rcyr> When you set it false, it just appends a timestamp to the URL to act as a cache breaker
[01:47:43] <kutenai> Right..
[01:48:04] <kutenai> one of my devs is seeing an exception when the data is cached, and his solution is to turn off caching.
[01:48:28] <kutenai> I'm pretty sure that's not a very good solution... and that there is some other explanation as to why jquery is generating an exception if the data is cached..
[01:48:34] <kutenai> just not sure what might cause that
[01:48:41] <rcyr> That's weird.
[01:48:58] <kutenai> my assumption is that under normal operation, if the data is cached, it will just call the success function a lot faster.
[01:49:04] <rcyr> It's not jquery that does the caching, it's your browser :/
[01:49:17] <rcyr> kutenai: If that's the case, the JS is broken.
[01:49:19] <kutenai> I agree.
[01:49:48] <kutenai> like I said, the $.ajax call should just return the cached data... period
[01:50:34] <rcyr> Also, as far as HTTP is concerned.... GET request are meant to be cacheable.
[01:50:43] <rcyr> Because they're "read-only" queries
[01:51:13] <rcyr> It really looks like a badly coded function... so you have a race condition.
[01:53:19] <kutenai> rcyr: yes... that sound very plausible, and likely..
[01:53:40] <kutenai> we are using promises... so perhaps something is not ready to receive the results in time..
[01:55:21] <rcyr> Could you paste just that part on a pastebin so we could look at it?
[01:55:34] <rcyr> (I understand that it's probably private code)
[01:57:06] <kutenai> not an issue..
[01:57:15] <kutenai> I just need to see if it's isolated enough
[01:59:40] <Abhijit> hi
[02:00:18] <Abhijit> when i search jquery notification plugins, most of the result are how to show a one time notification. but i want facebook like dropdown notification where user clickn on icon and then can scroll down to read more etc
[02:00:52] <Abhijit> how can i search that plugin?
[02:05:13] <kutenai> rcyr: it would be a lot of code to pull out into a pastebin and then go over the context.
[02:05:25] <rcyr> Too bad then :/
[02:05:37] <kutenai> Plus, I'm done for the night.. so, thanks for the tip.. I'll take a closer look tomorrow
[02:05:44] <rcyr> See you :)

[04:51:47] <Jeroen2> Hi there, dataset.data.push(getRandomResponseTime()); this works. But does anyone know how to remove the first value of that dataset?
[05:31:20] <jonascj_> Hi all. I do a $.ajax() call with 'type: "GET", data: {"key": $(this).val()}' but spaces in the input data "send this with ajax" gets replaced by '+'.
[05:31:29] <jonascj_> How to prevent this?
[05:54:03] <jonascj_> Is there a syntax similar to s[5:end] to get the substring starting at char5 and going to the end of the string?
[05:54:17] <jonascj_> s[5:-1] almost does it, except it trashes the last char
[05:54:58] <surianup> hi guys

[07:59:59] <django_> i just wana have a button that if you click it, execute some code, do i need a form?
[08:00:04] <django_> or just an input with submit
[08:01:53] <decx> <button> doesnt require a surrounding form in modern browsers anymore
[08:06:59] <django_> decx, ty
[08:14:08] <django_> decx, the event for a button is .on('submit')?
[08:18:31] <decx> just click
[08:25:42] <django_> im getting show is not a function for this: https://bpaste.net/show/ac0e2db0093b
[08:29:36] <decx> money
[08:40:00] <Mrprocom> Hi, I'm trying to detect when an element with a specific class was added, this was my attempt at it: https://jsfiddle.net/pv6s9t6g/1/
[08:40:24] <Mrprocom> the problem is that every time I click that text, a "Uncaught TypeError: addedElement.attr is not a function" error pops up in the console
[08:40:31] <decx> just call a function when you add stuff?
[08:40:50] <Mrprocom> that's not what I want
[08:41:05] <Mrprocom> it's for a tampermonkey script
[08:42:28] <decx> e.target is a native element
[08:42:34] <decx> it doesnt have an attr method
[08:42:49] <decx> wrap it up or use a native method
[08:45:07] <Mrprocom> decx: thanks, it worked :)
[09:07:21] <worknick> hi
[09:07:55] <worknick> i have a this code $('.infinite-pubact').scroll(function(){      console.log("Scrolling"); }); it does not print anything in firebug when i use scroll inside my fixed height div?
[09:07:58] <worknick> any ieda?
[09:08:00] <worknick> idea
[09:20:46] <Cork> worknick: scroll only fires when an element with overflow and scrollHeight > height is scrolled
[09:22:12] <Cork> worknick: if you want to catch mouse wheel unrelated to if the page is scrolled
[09:22:20] <Cork> try .on('wheel', func)
[09:24:56] <worknick> Cork: my div height is fixed and it has overflow scroll. and it has scroll bar.
[09:25:03] <worknick> i dont want to catch mouse whel.
[09:25:10] <worknick> i want infinite scrolling inside that div Cork
[09:25:29] <Cork> are you replacing that element?
[09:25:35] <worknick> no.
[09:25:37] <Cork> or are you selecting for it before it is added?
[09:25:51] <decx> does jqquery normalize wheel?
[09:26:04] <Cork> decx: normalize?
[09:26:05] <worknick> i dont know what that means.
[09:26:14] <decx> like wheel, mousewheel and DomMouseScroll
[09:26:18] <worknick> i just want to append conten on scroll read bottom.
[09:26:27] <worknick> oh decx is another user.
[09:26:29] <Cork> worknick: well ex if you just run $('.infinite-pubact').scroll(function(){ console.log("Scrolling"); }); in a script tag in head
[09:26:40] <Cork> worknick: you will try to bind it before the html document is parsed
[09:26:43] <Cork> so the element won't exist
[09:26:53] <Cork> that is an example of what i meant
[09:26:58] <worknick> ok
[09:27:09] <Cork> decx: wheel is a dom event
[09:27:10] <trudko> Hi everyone, any recommended jquery plugin(or maybe something else) for dropdown with support of 1. tooltips and images with options?
[09:27:15] <worknick> so how do i get infinite scrolling inside div? do you know some good jq plugin?
[09:27:21] <Cork> so no, no special magic by jquery
[09:27:30] <worknick> :-(
[09:27:42] <decx> yeah wheel is pretty new
[09:27:51] <decx> onmousewheel was in ie
[09:28:03] <decx> and chrome?!
[09:28:19] <Cork> worknick: if the div you are talking about is "infinite-pubact" then it should work exactly as you wrote it
[09:28:43] <Cork> decx: mousewheel was in most browsers (all?)
[09:28:51] <Cork> but the spec changed in rc
[09:29:03] <decx> apparently mousewheel was never a standard ^^
[09:29:58] <worknick> Cork: thats the issue that itns not working.
[09:30:04] <worknick> its in my rails app.
[09:30:33] <Cork> worknick: make a simple html example reproducing the problem
[09:30:40] <Cork> jsfiddle.net is a good online place
[09:30:43] <worknick> Cork: ok. will do it later and come back.
[09:30:45] <worknick> yeah
[09:43:06] <ajnr>  I am learning JQuery ,  I was trying to make a button by which I can open a page as well as it will show the busy/loading  text/gif. can any one point me where I am doing wrong http://pastebin.com/qsaYa5ep
[09:43:19] <Trinity> is there a way I can get signedCookies from the browser?
[10:13:04] <taplar> to loud in here
[10:39:23] <islalobo> We're using sweet alerts to send messages to users. I'm trying to set a radio button (to checked) if user his the cancel button in a sweet alert message: http://kopy.io/A9mUL
[10:39:31] <islalobo> But it isn't checking
[10:40:48] <taplar> $('input[id="refill-reminder-yes"]').attr('checked', 'checked'); <-- that?
[10:41:04] <islalobo> taplar: yea
[10:41:17] <taplar> $('#refill-reminder-yes').prop('checked', true);
[10:42:17] <islalobo> Thank you!
[11:05:29] <Panzamon> f
[11:10:05] <DevAntoine> hi
[11:10:11] <DevAntoine> I've got an array of jquery object
[11:10:24] <DevAntoine> I can access them using .get() but I won't have a jquery object anymore
[11:10:31] <taplar> eq()
[11:10:35] <DevAntoine> how can I get the second element of my array as a jquery object?
[11:10:36] <DevAntoine> oh
[11:10:47] <decx> it's a jquery collection
[11:10:51] <decx> it's only array like
[11:10:53] <decx> and yes, eq
[11:11:53] <DevAntoine> thanks taplar and decx
[11:12:01] <DevAntoine> and yes, it's a jquery collection, my bad
[11:12:25] <decx> you can still slice it tho
[11:31:16] <nagv> why does $('.link').first().click() not work while $('.link')[0].click() does ? I learned that click() triggers click event handler and if it isn't defined nothing happens, but why does second version work ?
[11:35:04] <snover> nagv: the first one calls the method 'click' on the element, which is an actual function that does something, the second one just sends an event, which doesnâ€™t do anything
[11:35:44] <snover> oops sorry, reverse "first" and "second"
[11:36:26] <cangelosx> why does $.ajax().done() parse the json response and fail() doesn't?
[11:36:48] <cangelosx> with done() the response is already a json object; with fail() I have to do response.responseJSON
[11:36:59] <nagv> snover: thanks
[11:40:11] <shoky> cangelosx because that's just the way it is in jquery. cause fail() is intended to signal that there was a problem responding to the request, which implies there's usually no response body at all.  you can just use JSON.parse btw on the xhr.responseText
[11:42:28] <shoky> cangelosx: ah nevermind i forgot it's jquery that adds that responseJSON field
[11:42:53] <shoky> cangelosx: so .fail() does parse the json :P
[11:43:25] <shoky> cangelosx:  and the first argument to the .fail() callback is not the response, it's the xhr object.  that's why you need .responseJSON
[12:19:08] <cangelosx> shoky: that makes sense
[12:21:16] <docmur> https://jsfiddle.net/gdnvnz02/1/  How do I get the value of those links?
[12:21:40] <taplar> uh, links really don't have values
[12:21:55] <taplar> you should make them data-value if you want to do that
[12:22:00] <taplar> and then get them with data('value')
[12:22:07] <docmur> okay
[12:23:50] <egp> Has anyone seen a plugin to deal with select drop downs that would have data in columns/aligning headers properly/etc  I had a fixed-width/space padding solution, but chinese characters really fuck with my Chi :)
[12:30:16] <lejocelyn> does jquery can interact with javascript function like play() ?
[12:30:30] <lejocelyn> something like : var domAudio = document.getElementById("audio_" + fullid);
[12:30:36] <lejocelyn> domAudio.play();
[12:30:46] <robertmaxrees> lejocelyn huh?
[12:30:49] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript.
[12:30:55] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what you're getting at.
[12:31:02] <lejocelyn> yes but domAudio isn't a jquery object
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> you can still access the underlying DOM object
[12:31:28] <lejocelyn> is there a way to have an jquery object use the function play ?
[12:31:31] <lejocelyn> ah
[12:31:42] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/get/
[12:32:51] <lejocelyn> robertmaxrees: so if I do myJqueryObject.get().play(), it should work ?
[12:32:57] <robertmaxrees> read the docs.
[12:33:15] <robertmaxrees> they're pretty clear.
[12:38:46] <lejocelyn> robertmaxrees: thanks a lot :)
[12:38:49] <robertmaxrees> deffo :D
[12:38:57] <lejocelyn> deffo ?
[12:39:06] <robertmaxrees> short for "definitely"
[12:39:36] <lejocelyn> this make my code clearer and working :)
[12:39:58] <robertmaxrees> allows you to reuse your jquery objects and all that.
[12:43:42] <Aristy> Hey guys, I have a weird problem
[12:43:44] <Aristy> I have code like this
[12:43:54] <Aristy> var myOwnQuery = jQuery.noConflict();
[12:44:07] <Aristy> Whenever I do is, window.$ becomes undefined
[12:44:14] <Aristy> anyone has an idea what could cause it?
[12:44:43] <taplar> that's what noConflict does.  it restores $ back to what it was before jQuery was assigned to it
[12:44:52] <taplar> if it wasn't assigned as anything, it would be undefined
[12:47:41] <Aristy> taplar: Well, my widget runs on third party websites
[12:48:02] <Aristy> What can I do to prevent it, use noConflict(true);
[12:48:02] <robertmaxrees> Aristy then they need to support your version of jquery :)
[12:48:17] <Aristy> They already have jQuery 1.11.2 on their page, which I rely on
[12:48:27] <robertmaxrees> then use it.
[12:48:33] <Aristy> I just simply do: myApplication.jQuery = jQuery.noConflict(); and rely on it
[12:48:39] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:48:40] <robertmaxrees> why?
[12:48:46] <robertmaxrees> you're already using their version.
[12:48:49] <Aristy> Because sometimes people have version 1.4.2
[12:48:55] <Aristy> and I load 1.7.0 myself
[12:49:04] <robertmaxrees> don't load your own version :(
[12:49:32] <Aristy> My script is like: "If this page has jQuery >= 1.7.0, then make app.jQuery equals jQuery and rely on app.jQuery. Otherwise, load 1.7.0 in noConflict mode and use it."
[12:49:37] <Aristy> Something like that basically
[12:49:39] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[12:49:51] <Aristy> What is that Robert?
[12:49:59] <robertmaxrees> loading your own version of jquery.
[12:50:10] <robertmaxrees> are you a service provider?  or just a widget author?
[12:50:26] <Aristy> We have a content recommendation service (like Taboola/Outbrain)
[12:50:45] <Aristy> and we render related content stuff when users signup to our service and place our code
[12:50:47] <robertmaxrees> it's not at all uncommon for those to require the site to run a particular version of jquery.
[12:51:05] <Aristy> I usually make JSONP calls for analytics (e.g .done() promise) but lower versions doesn't have it
[12:51:16] <Aristy> so we enforce jQuery 1.7.0 as minimum supported version
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, most places just require that the site loads a minimum version of jquery on their own.
[12:51:44] <robertmaxrees> instead of doing it for them, since that has impact on pageload times that you need to be careful about.
[12:52:07] <robertmaxrees> either way, read the docs for noConflict - you only want to run that if you're loading your own version to sue.
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees> *use
[12:52:51] <Aristy> well, sometimes they put our code at the header, which makes my application install jQuery 1.7.0 since no jQuery is present at that moment
[12:52:59] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:52:59] <Aristy> At the footer, they load jQuery 1.11.2 themself
[12:53:24] <robertmaxrees> you can't account for every edge case.
[12:53:36] <robertmaxrees> which is why i suggest you just have the site load a minimum required version.
[12:53:45] <robertmaxrees> instead of doing it yourself.
[12:54:50] <Aristy> Is there any way to load jQuery only for my application's IIFE scope?
[12:55:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery loads and executes globally - so no.
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> and IIFE scope is redundant fwiw :)
[12:55:39] <Aristy> god :(
[12:55:50] <robertmaxrees> what you're trying to do is really unusual and kind of unsolvable.
[12:56:23] <robertmaxrees> it's 100% normal to say "this widget relies on jquery 1.x/2.x and must be loaded after"
[12:56:52] <Aristy> Yeah, but majority of our clients are mommy bloggers who setup a blog on Blogger.com and have no idea what they're doing
[12:57:07] <robertmaxrees> so then they need to learn ;)
[12:57:18] <Aristy> Some of them load like 7 different jQuery versions on the page, lol
[12:57:22] <robertmaxrees> it's reasonable to expect that they understand the basics.
[12:57:36] <robertmaxrees> you cannot (and should not) account for every little funky thing they may/may not do.
[12:58:07] <Aristy> I wouldn't, but management goes crazy when we miss a site with 100 daily pageviews
[12:58:18] <Aristy> and I'm trying to find solutions
[12:58:37] <Aristy> I tried the noConflict yesterday, which caused trouble on our biggest client
[12:58:39] <robertmaxrees> then management needs to understnadf that what you're doing is pretty unrealistic.
[12:58:50] <Aristy> $ was removed from the global scope, so his own code (e.g $.ajax(...)) stopped working
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:59:01] <robertmaxrees> because you cannot account for every edge case.
[12:59:41] <Aristy> What happens if I use noConflict(true), though?
[12:59:54] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[12:59:59] <robertmaxrees> "A Boolean indicating whether to remove all jQuery variables from the global scope (including jQuery itself)."
[13:00:02] <Aristy> If I can at least solve the $ being undefined, that would be enough for us
[13:00:08] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that lol
[13:00:19] <robertmaxrees> if they load yours before the one they're relying on, you have no recourse.
[13:00:20] <robertmaxrees> like...
[13:00:56] <Aristy> If they load it before mine, then it is good, as long as the version is above 1.7.0. I can simply use window.jQuery then
[13:00:59] <robertmaxrees> noConflict relies on the notion that your copy of jquery loads after the other version(s) and that you then execute it.
[13:01:45] <Aristy> If they don't load it before mine, then my script loads 1.7.0 itself, thinking the page has no jQuery defined.
[13:01:58] <robertmaxrees> right, and then variables get stomped all over.
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> you're SOL.
[13:02:08] <taplar> could putting the logic in a window on load help?  wouldn't catch the case that they don't put jquery on the page at all though
[13:02:22] <robertmaxrees> taplar the real problem here is that they're adding extra pageweight.
[13:02:29] <Aristy> What happens in this case, though? I load 1.7.0 myself, use it and execute my application. Then, at the footer, they load jQuery 1.11.2 themself
[13:02:36] <robertmaxrees> and window load doesn't account for all assets that are dynamically loaded.
[13:02:41] <Aristy> Would window.$ and window.jQuery become 1.11.2 then?
[13:02:56] <robertmaxrees> Aristy basically, and your code breaks.
[13:02:57] <taplar> ah
[13:03:02] <robertmaxrees> becuase things aren't referencing the right places.
[13:03:17] <robertmaxrees> you realize that 1.7 and 1.11 aren't the same API, right?
[13:04:00] <Aristy> I only rely on certain features, such as ajax promises, DOM manipulation and certain events like click, those are mostly the same
[13:04:09] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:04:29] <robertmaxrees> lol good luck.  i'd love to see what you come up with.
[13:05:02] <Aristy> Q_Q, I better revert my noConflict commit
[13:05:29] <Mark____> i think thereâ€™s authority overuse in this freenode chatroom. i just got banned from #web, what do you guys think about it?
[13:05:38] <Mark____> and how do some people have authority over others?
[13:05:47] <robertmaxrees> Mark____ hrm?
[13:06:05] <robertmaxrees> Mark____ this really isn't the appropriate place to talk about getting banned form other channels.
[13:06:09] <Mark____> okay
[13:06:18] <Mark____> i was just asking for opinions but
[13:06:27] <robertmaxrees> if you have concerns about this channel, feel free to PM me and we can talk about it :)
[13:07:13] <taplar> i'm concerned.  seems like a sausage fest
[13:11:14] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[13:16:16] <taplar> btw i got to v1.0 of my pubsub plugin yesterday, :)  has the debug option and all.  qunit has some errors in jq 3.0 edge that i'm ignoring for now
[13:16:23] <robertmaxrees> daaaamn dude.
[13:16:24] <robertmaxrees> well done.
[13:16:31] <robertmaxrees> i haven't gotten a chance to poke at it.
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> if i'm not at work, i'm not touching code right now.
[13:16:49] <robertmaxrees> soooo slammed.
[13:17:08] <taplar> let me know if you do and see anything.  i'm trying to figure out if i want to tackle the tree topics or cross window topics next
[13:17:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.
[13:43:42] <phelix> So I have a each loop. Inside this loop I am creating my own object. I want to get the first letter of the name and organize the object so that all items that start with A are listed inside that array and all items that start with B are listed inside that array etc. Not quite sure how to make this happen.
[13:43:58] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[13:45:06] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/Lszb2wkk/
[13:45:33] <phelix> right now this is just basically only putting a single item under the letter. Which makes sense because they are over writing each other.
[13:45:49] <robertmaxrees> let's back up a sec - why are you building this object?
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> like, any reason you can't just .filter() and .map() the data when you need it?
[13:46:24] <phelix> Creating a list of countries. But want them organized under A to display all countries that start with A and then B for all countries that start with B etc.
[13:46:29] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[13:46:42] <robertmaxrees> small change to your code.
[13:46:57] <robertmaxrees> if (!countryResults[elem.name.charAt(0)]) { countryResults[elem.name.charAt(0)] ] [] }
[13:47:05] <robertmaxrees> and then you .push your object into that property.
[13:47:21] <phelix> hmm ok, let me check that out thanks
[13:47:27] <robertmaxrees> get the idea?
[13:47:31] <phelix> think so
[13:47:54] <taplar> i'd probably save off the first char in a var
[13:48:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:48:03] <robertmaxrees> agreed.
[13:48:04] <taplar> just for readability
[13:48:20] <taplar> otherwise worst case your doing that..... three times?
[13:48:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:48:43] <intensivex> I need a second pair of eyes if anyone has a sec. - https://jsfiddle.net/gothambranding/9gadpu3b/ I cannot get my event listeners to take. Line 30 ... trying to log on line 38 yet get no life.
[13:48:57] <phelix> ok
[13:49:06] <robertmaxrees> uuuh
[13:49:17] <robertmaxrees> is that minimized code?
[13:49:19] <taplar> lol
[13:49:22] <taplar> yeah, not touching that
[13:49:50] <robertmaxrees> also: are you using .on ooor...?
[13:50:15] <intensivex> im guessing you have to expand the code panel horizontally.
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[13:50:31] <robertmaxrees> line 30 is some minimized js.
[13:50:34] <robertmaxrees> sooo...
[13:50:41] <robertmaxrees> can you be more speicific?
[13:50:52] <intensivex> are you looking at the same thing I am?
[13:51:01] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:51:07] <intensivex> line 30 starts a condition if (window.addEventListener) {
[13:51:12] <awkwardCough> uh look at your link?
[13:51:13] <robertmaxrees> not in what you linked me.
[13:51:19] <robertmaxrees> line 30 is m && b.push(m); in what you linked.
[13:51:29] <robertmaxrees> hit "update" and share the link again.
[13:53:06] <shoky> i'm seeing what he's saying is there
[13:53:13] <intensivex> ok i updated and set it as base. that url should work now. also i have no array pushing going on
[13:53:19] <shoky> o
[13:53:24] <intensivex> https://jsfiddle.net/gothambranding/9gadpu3b/
[13:53:34] <taplar> woah
[13:53:41] <shoky> you can modify existing fiddles now?
[13:53:42] <taplar> i didn't realize fiddles could be replaced
[13:53:43] <shoky> yuck
[13:53:58] <intensivex> if you have an account, yes you can save them
[13:54:15] <taplar> i've been living a lie....
[13:54:39] <taplar> ok
[13:55:01] <intensivex> if you guys are wondering, I'm working off of the vimeo example here
[13:55:03] <intensivex> https://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api
[13:55:04] <taplar> so your registering events with vanilla
[13:55:12] <taplar> what part was not working?
[13:55:25] <intensivex> and trying to get multiple videos on the same page to populate a div with its own stats, time wtc
[13:55:33] <intensivex> etc*
[13:55:55] <intensivex> the main goal is then bolting in some google tag management. But i need to isolate the time lapse and video id's first
[13:56:39] <phelix> robertmaxrees: I am not exactly sure I am able to get what you suggested to work properly. Could you please maybe explain a little bit more on what you were trying to do with that if statement?
[13:56:47] <intensivex> and i need to make the code as portable as possible meaning this will eventually be a copy-> include which will detect vimeo iframe, listen for each iframe's events and record those events independently
[13:56:49] <robertmaxrees> phelix show me what you have,
[13:57:42] <phelix> same as before basically. Wasn't able to get much done with that if statement you showed me. https://jsfiddle.net/Lszb2wkk/1/
[13:58:03] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:58:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing anything different.
[13:58:16] <robertmaxrees> except for declaring a varibale.
[13:58:43] <phelix> yes, because i don't quite understand what you were trying to do with that if statement you provided me.
[13:59:35] <robertmaxrees> woops. didn't close things correctly in in.
[13:59:50] <django_> whats the best way to havethings hidden on initialize?
[14:00:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/Lszb2wkk/2/ phelix
[14:00:36] <intensivex> can anyone see why my window.addEventListner wouldn't be working? https://jsfiddle.net/gothambranding/9gadpu3b/
[14:00:47] <robertmaxrees> intensivex that's not a jquery question :)
[14:00:49] <shoky> intensivex:  i think it's working but you have your js code running on onload
[14:00:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in ##javascript fwiw.
[14:00:57] <phelix> ok let me check that out. Thanks
[14:01:18] <intensivex> jquery? it's a javascript question. you act as if i asked a php question.
[14:01:31] <intensivex> if you don't know, it's ok, maybe someone else may
[14:01:37] <robertmaxrees> that's not the problem.
[14:01:42] <robertmaxrees> there's no need to be rude.
[14:01:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm simply trying to point you in the right direction to get help, that's all :)
[14:03:22] <shoky> intensivex: click where it says javascript and choose load type : no wrap
[14:04:35] <intensivex> ok i just did, shoky
[14:04:56] <intensivex> oh hey
[14:04:58] <shoky> intensivex: ok you should see it logging the ready event now
[14:05:00] <intensivex> we have life!
[14:05:06] <intensivex> hey!
[14:05:11] <intensivex> what the hell, jsfiddle
[14:05:18] <intensivex> why would that matter?
[14:05:20] <taplar> you usually get life when you leave things unwrapped
[14:05:24] <taplar> OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
[14:05:29] <shoky> cause you added the event listener after the event happened
[14:05:30] * awkwardCough 
[14:05:38] <intensivex> haha ok
[14:06:05] <intensivex> thanks man, appreciate it. now i can move into the next issue.
[14:07:02] <rashkov> does jquery treat 304 Not Modified as an error? I'm using $.ajax and attaching to the promise that it returns. 304 forces the error callback to be fired, not success. Why?
[14:08:42] <cangelosx> because 304 is an error
[14:08:48] <robertmaxrees> it is?
[14:08:54] <shoky> rashkov: no that's not an error
[14:08:56] <taplar> shouldn't be.  it's not modified
[14:08:57] <robertmaxrees> not modified doesn't sound like an error.
[14:09:06] <robertmaxrees> rashkov you sure your response is well formed?
[14:09:20] <cangelosx> i thought most non 2xx codes were errors
[14:09:25] <cangelosx> i kinda pulled that one out of my ass lo
[14:09:26] <cangelosx> l
[14:09:32] <shoky> all non 2xx codes except 304 are errors ;p
[14:09:33] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx a lot of them are, others aren''t.
[14:09:36] <rashkov> robertmaxrees: it's possible that it's not well formed. What should I look for?
[14:09:44] <Uhkis> that non-modified data might still have error in it ;)
[14:09:49] <robertmaxrees> rashkov make sure the data is properly formed?
[14:10:45] <rashkov> robertmaxrees: you're right, the json has an extra commma where it should not. thank you
[14:11:33] <rashkov> I would hope that json.parse should throw an error... hard to debug this one without knowing where to look. Anyway, thanks very much
[14:11:42] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:12:03] <shoky> rashkov: easier to debug if you log the arguments to the error callback
[14:12:59] <rashkov> shoky: oh yeah, there it is. Seeing an error SyntaxError: Unexpected token , at Object.parse (native) at jQuery.parseJSON
[14:15:17] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[14:15:39] <cangelosx> shoky: so then  304 WOULD BE AN ERROR, NO?
[14:15:46] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:15:50] <robertmaxrees> 304 is Not Modified.
[14:15:51] <cangelosx> oops caps
[14:15:52] <cangelosx> sorry
[14:15:57] <cangelosx> (01:09:33 PM) shoky: all non 2xx codes except 304 are errors ;p
[14:16:06] <cangelosx> im just adding 1+1 here lol
[14:16:07] <shoky> cangelosx: right.. except 304 :P
[14:16:11] <cangelosx> oh
[14:16:13] <cangelosx> wait
[14:16:13] <shoky> i.e. 304 is not an error
[14:16:21] <robertmaxrees> and that's not true necessarily shoky.
[14:16:25] <cangelosx> i read that as 302
[14:16:30] <robertmaxrees> 301 is a redirect.
[14:16:40] <robertmaxrees> 307, as well.
[14:16:55] <robertmaxrees> 302 would bve arguable imo.
[14:17:27] <shoky> ok but jquery won't see those
[14:17:44] <shoky> i was talking about waht jquery treats as an error
[14:17:47] <cangelosx> this may not be the correct channel but idk where else to ask. I'm getting Unexpected end of input when including toastr.js in my gulpfile
[14:17:50] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.  yeah ok.
[14:18:03] <shoky> specifically this line in jq src:  isSuccess = status >= 200 && status < 300 || status === 304;
[14:18:04] <cangelosx> gulp completes successfully but page script is Unexpected end of input
[14:19:23] <shoky> yep, not the correct channel ;p
[14:19:46] <cangelosx> would you 302 me to the correct channel?
[14:19:56] <intensivex> cangelosx try channel #node.js  ...
[14:19:58] <shoky> #javascript or maybe #Node.js
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> intensivex it's a js question, no?  if you don't know the answer, somebody else might.
[14:20:14] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:20:24] <Uhkis> lol
[14:20:42] <intensivex> he asked for a room recommendation. sorry you couldnt answer my question earlier.
[14:20:49] <intensivex> i mean really ?
[14:20:53] <robertmaxrees> wow duder.
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> it was a joke.
[14:21:01] * Uhkis gets popcorn
[14:21:02] <robertmaxrees> and it had nothing to do with me knowing or not knowing.
[14:21:08] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you're being so defensive.
[14:21:12] <cangelosx> I'm getting `(01:20:51 PM) Cannot send to channel` in #Node.js
[14:21:24] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx are you registered and logged in?
[14:21:35] <mmmveggies> .attr or .prop?
[14:21:36] <intensivex> are you missing the nonsense coming out of your fingers? I'm just responding to your bs man ...
[14:21:44] <cangelosx> not registered, but logged in
[14:21:49] <cangelosx> err
[14:21:50] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx yeah you need to reg.
[14:21:52] <cangelosx> i cant be logged in
[14:21:56] <arc_> intensivex chill out
[14:22:01] <cangelosx> if im not registered
[14:22:12] <robertmaxrees> intensivex you're being pretty rude to me still.  if you have an issue, feel free to PM me.  otherwise, please calm down :)
[14:22:27] <intensivex> im chill. but don't give this guy the free pass. im just responding to him.
[14:22:39] <cangelosx> no harm done
[14:22:40] <robertmaxrees> a "free pass"?
[14:22:59] <intensivex> yea buddy, take your own advice and get off my case. why are you even still going on right now?
[14:23:06] <arc_> lol wow
[14:23:11] <robertmaxrees> because i feel disrespected right now.
[14:23:11] <mmmveggies> sorry, is it better to use .attr or .prop to change the "type" attribute on an <input>
[14:23:14] <Uhkis> mmmveggies: depends, what are you setting? (or getting)
[14:23:14] <robertmaxrees> please stop :) thanks :)
[14:23:38] <Uhkis> mmmveggies: i'd go with attr
[14:23:39] <cangelosx> intensivex is taking the ix*e out of his name right now
[14:23:53] <shoky> mmmveggies: you shouldn't change the type of an input ever really, not with attr nor prop ;p
[14:24:49] <mmmveggies> Uhkis: mkay. shoky: I know it's probably wrong. is there a CSS setting I could use so that I could just add a class to an input type="password" in order to make it visible?
[14:24:50] <arc_> intensivex imagine what it would be like to be one of the main people who provide support in the jquery support channel, with people asking offtopic questions dozens of times per day. it's not that unreasonable to point people toward the proper channels to get support when they aren't asking about jquery
[14:25:02] <arc_> you may still get help
[14:25:12] <arc_> but he wasn't being disrespectful. he was just telling you it's offtopic
[14:26:09] <cangelosx> you guys are confusing me
[14:26:14] <cangelosx> i was the one who asked for help
[14:26:20] <arc_> it was prior to that
[14:26:27] <cangelosx> then i asked for channel and intensivex responded
[14:26:36] <shoky> can we leave this subject already
[14:26:41] <intensivex> I have no idea what these guys are even going on about.
[14:26:43] <shoky> nobody cares
[14:26:50] <intensivex> ^
[14:26:54] <intensivex> thanks shoky
[14:28:04] <mmmveggies> it seems like the only way to disable the *** of password feilds is to remove the "password" type from them
[14:28:30] <taplar> maybe i missed something during the foray.  why would you want to do that?
[14:29:08] <mmmveggies> its been requested as a feature, for old people or something
[14:29:15] <shoky> mmmveggies: donno i doubt that's possible with css. i see people doing it indeed with changing .type, donno how safe that is. (i know it wasn't safe in old IE)  anyways if you do do that, .prop is fine
[14:29:21] <taplar> you realize it's a security feature, right?
[14:29:32] <Uhkis> mmmveggies: that is getting more popular everywhere, i'd go with changing type to text
[14:29:37] <mmmveggies> taplar I have no say in this unfortunately
[14:29:49] <mmmveggies> Uhkis okay. That was my original fix. Thanks
[14:29:57] <taplar> :s
[14:29:59] <mmmveggies> shoky thanks as well
[14:30:38] <Uhkis> taplar: similar security feature would be "could you GTFO from behind me" :D
[14:31:08] <taplar> *shrug*
[14:31:19] <robertmaxrees> we have a "click to show" feature on our sites.
[14:31:33] <robertmaxrees> it it made a pretty big difference in the amount of password entry failures we had.
[14:31:49] <Uhkis> which is why it's getting more popular
[14:31:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:31:54] <z1haze> can you use a wildcard is jquery like if(action === 'delete-*') { ... do this.. being * means anything following delete-
[14:32:05] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you'd need to use regex.
[14:32:11] <robertmaxrees> that's just normal js there.
[14:32:19] <z1haze> damn i never can figure that out
[14:32:33] <z1haze> what would be regex anything following delete- ?
[14:32:51] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want anything that starts with delete- ?
[14:32:56] <z1haze> yes, sorry
[14:32:58] <mmmveggies> z2haze: if(/^delete-/.test(action))
[14:33:08] <robertmaxrees> because you can just action.indexOf('delete-') === 0
[14:33:11] <z1haze> i just want to match delete- anything
[14:33:21] <z1haze> oh
[14:33:21] <z1haze> ok
[14:33:43] <z1haze> so if its delete-user, or delete-favorite, it wont matter? it will still hit that?
[14:33:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:34:03] <robertmaxrees> because the index of the substring delete- is still 0.
[14:35:53] <mmmveggies> I think in ES6 there's a string.strartsWith method
[14:36:18] <robertmaxrees> that exists, too.
[14:36:26] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you're targeting/your build process/etc.
[15:11:43] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone
[15:12:04] <taplar> a cyclopse doctor...
[15:12:06] <Uhkis> hi DoctorMonocular!
[15:12:16] <DoctorMonocular> I'm wondering if there's a way I can listen for an event that is triggered inside an iframe (cross domain)?
[15:12:55] <taplar> events don't bubble across doms
[15:13:10] <taplar> afaik
[15:13:19] <taplar> regardless of cors
[15:13:44] <DoctorMonocular> :( yah, I thought it might not work
[15:13:57] <DoctorMonocular> I guess I could poll for certain dom changes in the iframe
[15:14:03] <DoctorMonocular> so gross though
[15:14:09] <taplar> nope
[15:14:15] <taplar> cors will stop you from having access
[15:14:40] <DoctorMonocular> wait, really? I can't access the dom in an iframe? I remember doing that some time back
[15:14:44] <DoctorMonocular> has the security model changed?
[15:14:49] <taplar> you can if it's the same domain
[15:15:48] <DoctorMonocular> ok, well shit.
[15:16:53] <DoctorMonocular> maybe you'll have a clever idea here: I have a signup process, and step 2 is scheduling an interview via calendly. I put calendly in an iframe, and when it's done scheduling, I want to redirect to the step in the signup process
[15:17:02] <DoctorMonocular> is there anything i can do on the clientside to make that happen?
[15:17:36] <taplar> can you determine any of that based on the iframe's current url?
[15:17:44] <DoctorMonocular> my alternative is to have a webhook listening for the schedule event, and then on the clientside I'm polling my own server to see if that webhook was hit yet, then I redirect based on that, but shit that's horrific
[15:17:57] <DoctorMonocular> oh, good question, I actually have no idea, lemme check
[15:18:50] <DoctorMonocular> no, calendly doesn't change urls for the "confirmed" page
[15:18:56] <taplar> :(
[15:19:20] <taplar> s'all i got
[15:19:39] <DoctorMonocular> damn, webhook city might be my option...

[15:50:40] <tomasm-> hi, if  I have some sort of time-consuming form submission (I have the buffers auto-flush and send back javascript code to update a progress bar), is it possible to trigger  an event if the user cancels the form being submitted (in mid-transport)?
[16:13:45] <taplar> lol phptobomber.net is both funny and infurating at the same time
[16:35:36] <Uhkis> taplar: sounds like some evil library
[16:39:04] <taplar> it's terrible.  people really don't tag stuff well
[16:39:51] <taplar> there was one that was like a mountain landscape and the tag that the site picked out from it was "brown"
[16:40:33] <Uhkis> taplar: you do realize you typoed it to "php to bomber" :D
[16:40:52] <taplar> ......i did not
[16:41:09] <shoky> ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
[16:42:23] <Uhkis> yeah, that was kinda disappointing, i was hoping for something crazy in php
[16:44:16] <taplar> i'm just glad p is next to o
[16:44:27] <taplar> otherwise i'd be questioning my sanity
[16:44:55] <taplar> *more
[16:45:08] <Uhkis> :)
[16:55:34] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[16:56:54] <robertmaxrees> how is it almost 2 holy cripes.
[16:57:18] <taplar> 15:00 ?
[16:57:22] <taplar> err, 14
[16:57:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[16:57:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm west coast usa.
[16:57:48] <taplar> interesting, figured you'd be like 3 different from me
[16:59:09] <arc_> i'd like to see how much more likely it is that you live on the west coast if you're a programmer :p
[16:59:21] <robertmaxrees> makes sense.l
[17:00:00] <taplar> you mean limiting the pool to america?
[17:00:07] <arc_> yes
[17:01:15] <arc_> or even the percentage of programmers in pacific time vs each other time zone
[17:01:26] <arc_> in the world
[17:02:13] <taplar> hmm http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151131.htm#st
[17:03:43] <arc_> a bit outdated, but interesting
[17:06:28] <arc_> i know this is offtopic, but does anyone happen to know if you can configure tinymce to only be accessible by a logged in user
[17:06:45] <arc_> i don't see any reference to that on their site
[17:07:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:07:37] <robertmaxrees> what would you show instead?
[17:07:57] <arc_> i guess i don't understand the question
[17:08:26] <arc_> are you asking what the alternative would be to what i asked?
[17:08:40] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:08:56] <robertmaxrees> "only be accessible by a logged in user" - isn't tinymce just a thing you include on the page?
[17:09:02] <arc_> yes
[17:09:07] <robertmaxrees> like, wouldn't you just not initialize it if they're not logged in?
[17:09:22] <taplar> do you mean accessible as in displayed, or do you mean accessible as in only available if they are on your site
[17:09:41] <taplar> like preventing remote linking
[17:10:04] <arc_> the idea is, if i use a static html theme and i want to add wysiwyg functionality, does tinymce come with some authentication feature or do i have to make that myself
[17:10:35] <taplar> what is there to authenticate?
[17:10:36] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to make that yourself.
[17:11:00] <arc_> taplar i basically am making a site for someone who doesn't want to deal with html, but wants to be able to udpate it
[17:11:08] <taplar> ooooh
[17:11:13] <taplar> gotcha
[17:11:24] <arc_> thanks robertmaxrees
[17:11:30] <robertmaxrees> arc_ then it's not really static.
[17:11:34] <robertmaxrees> they still need a backend :)
[17:11:40] <arc_> the base was static
[17:11:46] <arc_> that's all i meant
[17:12:00] <arc_> backend is no problem
[17:12:22] <arc_> don't want to use something like wordpress
[17:12:35] <robertmaxrees> even though you basically just described that? :)
[17:12:54] <arc_> yes but it's a non-standard version, so if some wordpress exploit comes out, the site won't be vulnerable to it
[17:13:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:13:05] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:13:18] <taplar> provided yours doesn't have it's own vulnerabilities
[17:13:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:13:30] <arc_> i understand that
[17:13:41] <robertmaxrees> you could have plenty of vulns in your DB, your code, your webserver, etc.
[17:13:59] <arc_> it's not a particularly high profile site, i just don't want to deal with the possibility of a bot being written to install malware on it just because of the cms it uses
[17:14:06] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:14:30] <arc_> which seems to happen literally every time i have been forced to use wordpress for anything
[17:14:56] <robertmaxrees> why not look into another CMS?
[17:14:58] <taplar> i'd possibly be tempted in teaching them how to use ftp through the browser, and then let them edit the webpages how ever they want
[17:15:24] <arc_> if it were an option i would definitely stick with static html
[17:15:36] <arc_> maybe an offline wysiwyg html editor would be better
[17:15:49] <robertmaxrees> they they'd get how markdown works?
[17:16:11] <arc_> sure, that's not that complicated
[17:16:19] <robertmaxrees> why not use jekyll then?
[17:16:31] <arc_> ah yeah i forgot about this
[17:16:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:21:21] <taplar> interesting
[17:35:48] <badcss> can someone tell me how to combine events? i have a $(document).mousemove(function() {
[17:35:54] <badcss> but I want to make it on click too
[17:35:54] <robertmaxrees> use .on()
[17:36:10] <robertmaxrees> .on('mousemove click', function() {});
[17:37:34] <badcss> sweet!
[17:37:35] <badcss> thanks
[17:37:36] <badcss> it worked
[17:39:56] <cangelosx> what's the appropriate response code when the xsrf token is expired and therefore mismatched?
[17:41:31] <taplar> what would that be, invalid request?
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees>  4
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> down vote
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> accepted
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> 	
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> 401 Unauthorized.
[17:41:59] <robertmaxrees> woops hahaha
[17:42:18] <robertmaxrees> 401 - you're no longer authorized.  don't need to give any more info.
[17:42:30] <cangelosx> is it valid to include a redirect url to the login page in that 401 response
[17:42:44] <taplar> might set one as a header
[17:42:44] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[17:43:14] <taplar> though wouldn't the site know where the login page is?
[17:43:17] <cangelosx> thing of it as that it's not an API, but I'd want to tell the page it's 401 and redirect the page to login
[17:43:32] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do a redirect imo.
[17:43:33] <cangelosx> the client side doesn't know
[17:43:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a discrete action.
[17:44:03] <robertmaxrees> whatever is calling the api should know what to do then when it gets a 401.
[17:44:05] <cangelosx> well, let's say you're on an ajax form. you let it sit there for several hours, the token expires, and the ajax call comes back 401
[17:44:24] <taplar> so error or fail() would now what to do
[17:44:24] <cangelosx> i understand that from a technical standpoint
[17:44:31] <taplar> *know
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> so you mean from a UX perspective.
[17:44:36] <cangelosx> but what i mean is from a UX standpoint
[17:44:37] <cangelosx> yes
[17:44:44] <robertmaxrees> you tell the user they need to log in again.
[17:45:01] <cangelosx> makes sense
[17:45:03] <robertmaxrees> you could give them an option to go back to log in.
[17:45:11] <robertmaxrees> but taking them there directly and automatically is a little much imo.
[17:45:17] <cangelosx> true
[17:45:43] <cangelosx> besides i could even make it to where jquery saves the form input for when they log back in
[17:45:49] <taplar> hmm, i'd think leaving them where they are when they are not going to be able to do anything else would be a bit strange
[17:46:16] <cangelosx> which is why i was thinking redirect
[17:46:16] <robertmaxrees> taplar it's stragne except they're editing a form.
[17:46:23] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx where are you saving the form data?
[17:46:27] <cangelosx> but i guess a prompt with a go to login would suffice
[17:46:42] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: not sure, maybe a cookie
[17:46:49] <cangelosx> maybe a storage api
[17:47:00] <robertmaxrees> and that's where i'd get worried - cookies and things can get cleared pretty easily.
[17:47:13] <cangelosx> it's only temporary for after the redirect
[17:47:19] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could do that as well, but depending on how big the form is...
[17:47:31] <cangelosx> yeah
[17:47:31] <robertmaxrees> want to make sure they can copy things over if they need to.
[17:47:49] <cangelosx> if the form's really that important i'd autosave a copy of it to server
[17:47:58] <robertmaxrees> not if they're not authorized ;)
[17:48:20] <cangelosx> well, any changes they'd previously made would already be auto saved
[17:48:27] <taplar> hmm, what about a login modal overlaying their present page?  could you do that?
[17:48:32] <cangelosx> at the moment they made them
[17:48:42] <robertmaxrees> taplar's suggestion would be your safest bet imo.
[17:48:50] <cangelosx> taplar: that's not a bad idea
[17:48:54] <cangelosx> i didnt even think of that
[17:49:18] <cangelosx> it's a laravel app so im not sure how often or how the token expires
[17:49:26] <cangelosx> but it happened while i was afk so i thought of it
[17:51:35] * taplar quietly does the arm pump and *yesssssss*
[18:02:12] <kutenai> rcyr: you around today?
[18:18:03] <cangelosx> what's the cleanest way to force-keep focus on a certain element while user is on the page?
[18:18:38] <cangelosx> in case you need to know why, this particular view is for physical inventory and I need to capture the input for a barcode scanner
[19:30:16] <vinxz> Hi guys, I have a problem. I have a div z-index 1 and an iframe z-index 2 overlayed. I want to propagate click on div to iframe. Any people can suggest me how can I do it? Thanks
[19:30:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:30:35] <robertmaxrees> is the div inside the iframe?
[19:32:55] <vinxz> robertmaxrees: no dude, the iframe is outside div
[19:33:14] <robertmaxrees> vinxz so then "propogate" is the wrong term.  are you trying to have clicks on the div go "through" it to the iframe?
[19:33:27] <robertmaxrees> because the scenario you just described means the iframe is over the div.
[19:39:17] <vinxz> robertmaxrees: ok. This is my scenario: https://jsfiddle.net/asn7wwc7/ . I want when someone click on my div, it clicks on my iframe too :)
[19:39:43] <robertmaxrees> right, so the iframe is below the div.
[19:39:58] <robertmaxrees> depending on browser support, you can use the pointer-events css propertry.
[19:51:09] <TheKarlBrown> I am following a tutorial for materialize and I have been instructed to add
[19:51:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm shivering with anticip...
[19:52:07] <TheKarlBrown> $(".button-collapse").sideNav(); to a pages $(document).ready can anyone assist me? I am fairly new to js. I tried adding a script with a #(document).ready to the head but have had no luck
[19:52:26] <robertmaxrees> TheKarlBrown sure.  what are you confused about?
[19:52:34] <robertmaxrees> use something like bpaste and show us your code :)
[19:52:57] <jim_j> hi
[19:53:03] <TheKarlBrown> mtgwatcher.bid its fairly simple the source is all there
[19:53:14] <robertmaxrees> the_council uh...
[19:53:14] <jim_j> is there a simple one line jquery popup you can do within the a href tag?
[19:53:20] <robertmaxrees> TheKarlBrown i can't see that file.
[19:53:29] <TheKarlBrown> No that's a website
[19:53:54] <TheKarlBrown> I am trying to implement a menubar for mobile
[19:54:01] <robertmaxrees> TheKarlBrown open your console.
[19:54:03] <robertmaxrees> see the error?
[19:54:38] <TheKarlBrown> *hangs head in shame that he did not check the console*
[19:54:45] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:06:23] <TheKarlBrown> thanks Robertmaxrees
[20:06:26] <robertmaxrees> yep
[20:15:25] <RonRichie> hey could someone please help me with this error? https://jsfiddle.net/swy1e1qo/1/ it says `.li.text is not a function`, not sure how to handle this ? :-/
[20:15:38] <robertmaxrees> li is a raw dom node.
[20:15:44] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't have jquery methods attached to it.
[20:16:28] <robertmaxrees> RonRichie does that make sense?
[20:20:57] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees likes the dom raw
[20:21:29] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz raw dommin'
[20:21:29] <RonRichie> someone could help with this please? :( https://jsfiddle.net/swy1e1qo/3/
[20:21:51] <robertmaxrees> RonRichie i already answered your question.
[20:22:02] <robertmaxrees> you created a raw DOM node - those don't have jquery methopds on them.
[20:22:14] <RonRichie> robertmaxrees I got disconnected just a bit ago, and it didn't come through I guess :-/
[20:22:35] <RonRichie> ahhh... so jquery functions can't operate on elements created by raw DOM functions ?
[20:23:00] <RonRichie> yeah I see what you mean though, it makes sense now ;)
[20:23:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:24:33] <RonRichie> gotcha, thanks :)
[21:34:24] <duellsy> when using the selector, is there a way that I can narrow the available nodes that that actually looks in to begin with?
[22:03:26] <enerel> hello i have a question
[22:03:59] <enerel> i want to refresh div everytime mySQL is updated is it possible?
[22:17:36] <kevireilly> enerel: sure, check out MySQL triggers
[22:18:28] <kevireilly> for getting those changes to a client, the client will either need to regularly ping a server or a websockets library may be another option
[23:05:13] <silverdust> How may I achieve toggling height width .animate() such that it doesn't make the element completely disappear
[23:05:46] <silverdust> I have it at height 20px and I want to toggle to 200px and back
