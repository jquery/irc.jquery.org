[00:02:03] <datazombie> Cork: I updated the ajax call and now im getting a No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present. http://jsfiddle.net/hLqqggro/1/
[00:02:28] <Cork> datazombie: are you posting cross domain?
[00:02:50] <datazombie> I am post from localhost to a staging api server in the cloud
[00:03:07] <Cork> ok then you need to add support to OPTION requests to the server
[00:03:19] <Cork> and it has to allow your site to do patch requests
[00:03:37] <Cork> without that you can't do post calls to the domain
[00:04:07] <Cork> datazombie: the server needs to respond with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: your-site-here header
[00:04:16] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[00:04:16] <b-ot> Cork: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[00:05:14] <datazombie> I have rack-cors with the "*" wildcard option
[00:05:32] <root3d> can i catch an error if i am selecting a drop down list option by value . for eg. $("#someid").val("non-existent-value") ;
[00:05:56] <root3d> if there is non-existent-value nothing happens. how can i get to know about it ?
[00:09:58] <mooncup> https://github.com/ajlopez/CobolScript well I'm never writing straight js again
[00:10:10] <mooncup> from now on all my development will be in cobol
[00:28:40] <dannymichel> I'm getting anonymous function for http://pastebin.com/0N83Ay5a $.post(($this).attr('action'), ($this).serialize(), function(data) {
[00:36:48] <Cork> dannymichel: (($this) <--
[00:37:06] <Cork> extra parenthesis
[00:37:18] <Cork> ah, no
[00:37:27] <Cork> dannymichel: why are you adding all the extra () in the code?
[00:39:57] <dannymichel> with $.post($this).attr('action'), ($this).serialize(), function(data) { i get unexpected token and with $.post($this.attr('action'), $this.serialize(), function(data) { i get anonymouse function
[00:40:25] <dannymichel> should it be $.post$this.attr('action'), $this.serialize(), function(data) { Cork ?
[00:40:26] <Cork> dannymichel: also define your variables
[00:40:52] <Cork> dannymichel: $.post($this.attr(), $this.serialzie(), function() {})
[00:41:14] <dannymichel> var $this = $(this); Cork ?
[00:41:45] <juro> Hi, when I attach a click event to a submit button like so http://pastie.org/9993109, why isn't the form submitted anymore?
[00:41:51] <Cork> dannymichel: yes
[00:42:17] <dannymichel> with your change, i get unexpected } in the last }); Cork
[00:42:21] <Cork> juro: always use the submit event on the form, not click on a button
[00:43:05] <dannymichel> so the new one is http://pastebin.com/MnEejZMs Cork
[00:43:25] <dannymichel> whats wrong with that last }); Cork ?
[00:44:02] <juro> Cork, I tried that but then the button is never replaced making it possible for the user to submit twice when, e.g. the file upload is slow
[00:44:51] <Cork> dannymichel: http://jsfiddle.net/ve3e4ykL/
[00:45:28] <Cork> juro: bind a submit even on the form, when the submit function starts set prop('disabled', true) on the button
[00:45:39] <Cork> and you solved that problem
[00:45:47] <juro> Cork, never mind. I've changed it so that the $(this).html("addSpinner");
[00:46:02] <Cork> juro: you still should use submit not click
[00:46:11] <juro> Cork, will do. thank you.
[00:48:14] <dannymichel> so http://pastebin.com/dNSqktAH Cork ?
[00:48:25] <Cork> dannymichel: please stop using pastebin
[00:48:34] <Cork> its a pain to respond to them
[00:48:36] <Cork> use jsfiddle
[00:48:57] <Cork> and i gave you how it should look
[00:49:09] <Cork> look at your code and find what your missing
[00:49:26] <Omar-> morning
[00:50:00] <mogaj> Hi, i am trying to get two datetime pickers work using this plugin http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/ ... i am trying set the second datetime field starting date the one selected in first datetime field but i am not able to get that happening pls assist thank you https://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/6s0qLujp/
[00:51:06] <dannymichel> thats what i did Cork
[00:55:38] <Uhkis> that is just not true :D
[01:28:44] <dannymichel> $10.00 to fix this block of code? i just wasted 2 and a half hours on it
[01:35:01] <Cork> dannymichel: well you prob should learn basic js syntax before accepting a job like that
[01:35:14] <dannymichel> its not my job
[01:35:23] <dannymichel> its my site and I'm offering the job
[01:35:30] <dannymichel> I'm offering 10 to fix it
[01:36:08] <Cork> dannymichel: #freelance
[01:37:00] <Omar-> i'd do it for $100
[01:37:01] <Omar-> :P
[02:13:59] <flobin> is there a method like .append(); that, instead of appending something to an element, replaces its content?
[02:14:12] <Cork> ?api html
[02:14:13] <b-ot> Cork: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[02:14:56] <flobin> ah, thanks!
[02:20:33] <Uhkis> ?api replacewith
[02:20:33] <b-ot> Uhkis: .replaceWith(): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[02:20:49] <Uhkis> what's the difference?
[02:20:49] <Cork> Uhkis: that doesn't replace the content though
[02:21:00] <Cork> it replaces the element it self
[02:21:05] <Uhkis> ok
[02:21:19] <Cork> (its a short hand for after().remove())
[02:36:59] <dANO_> Hi, I have a select which lets you select a file to upload , I would like once the user has added his file, I display an alert message. I tried to display the alert when the user click on the browsebutton but it doesn't work . Anyone can help me ?
[02:39:43] <Cork> dANO_: bind the change event
[02:43:15] <dANO_> Cork: yeah thank's !
[02:51:28] <chargen> Hi. I want to make a little animation by changing the src of an img. I've tried using nested setTimeouts but it looks very chunky. Do you know a way to make it in smoother way?
[02:54:44] <Omar-> chargen i guess it'd look better if you replace image after animation ends
[02:54:58] <Omar-> chargen are you using CSS or .animation() ?
[02:55:07] <chargen> just timeouts
[02:55:46] <chargen> Maybe I need to do it with .animate()?
[03:23:18] <Omar-> chargen you still there?
[03:23:23] <chargen> yes
[03:23:56] <chargen> I'm still looking a way to do it. Maybe I just need to preload the images
[03:24:55] <Omar-> chargen yup, preloading is needed
[03:25:07] <Omar-> i'm creating a demo of an idea I have
[03:26:13] <chargen> nice
[03:33:37] <hrusti> is it possible to do ajax cross domain call without server side proxy?
[03:35:07] <Omar-> chargen maybe something like this http://jsfiddle.net/pmvn8vp2/
[03:37:40] <chargen> That could work, thank you
[03:37:51] <Omar-> chargen its not perfect, just an idea
[03:39:29] <Cork> hrusti: you either have to configure the server correctly or have a proxy
[03:39:42] <Cork> there isn't a way to "hack" around it
[03:40:07] <hrusti> ok cant configure the server becouse is not my site
[03:40:20] <Cork> hrusti: ya, and that is why the block exist
[03:40:21] <hrusti> so only way without proxy is that server support jsonp
[03:40:36] <Cork> hrusti: no, the server can sett the cors header
[03:40:48] <Cork> and then you can use normal ajax
[03:42:11] <hrusti> Cork: server which I want to send request to(api server), not mine(proxy), right?
[03:42:33] <Cork> hrusti: yes, the end with the data is the one that has to allow you to access there data
[03:43:02] <Cork> lots of internet sites depend on this
[03:43:51] <hrusti> Cork I do not have influence on that server so this is not possible :D
[03:44:14] <Cork> hrusti: ya, again that is intentional
[03:44:41] <Cork> there wouldn't be any point to be block if third parties could disable it
[03:44:53] <Cork> *point in the blocking
[03:46:12] <Cork> hrusti: it would be kinda bad if random site could do $.ajax('http://facebook.com/...') and grab your full address, your pass word or email or what ever
[03:46:33] <Cork> pass word?? >_<'
[03:46:48] <Cork> man i'm distracted right now...
[03:47:27] <hrusti> Cork: yes but if if public api`s would allow that it wouldn`t be so bad?
[03:47:54] <Cork> hrusti: if the api is meant to be used on the web, yes
[03:48:05] <hrusti> sure :)
[03:48:09] <Cork> hrusti: but remember running it on the server isn't the same as running it in the browser
[03:48:20] <Cork> in the browser you have access to the users session cookie
[03:48:26] <Cork> so you can access the site AS THEM
[03:48:35] <Cork> that is where the big difference is
[03:49:25] <hrusti> oh I see
[03:49:52] <hrusti> not my attention really but anyway :)
[03:50:00] <hrusti> youre right
[03:50:32] <Cork> its also possible to use that for ddos
[03:50:52] <Cork> while if you have to proxy it to a server it will all come from one ip
[03:51:07] <Cork> so you can't hide where it comes from
[03:51:37] <hrusti> yes I guess that is why my target site didin`t configured server like this
[03:51:43] <hrusti> they have request limitation
[03:51:57] <hrusti> so handling this is probably my task now :)
[03:52:25] <Cork> hrusti: ya, that is normally the reason to now allow web access
[03:52:28] <hrusti> btw what`s the best solution for this? Crone job and save/read it from file?
[03:52:42] <Cork> cause then they have a hard time enforcing site request limits
[03:52:48] <hrusti> not really jquery question but ok :)
[03:53:03] <Cork> hrusti: well i would prob not save it to a file but to a database
[03:53:04] <Cork> but ya
[03:53:52] <hrusti> Cork: what about cache? I need fast access becouse I will need this data almost every time :)
[03:54:16] <hrusti> every requst/response*
[03:54:20] <Cork> hrusti: sql access to a plain database should be fast enough
[03:54:38] <Cork> but ya, if you need extreamly fast access memcache is a good offloading
[03:54:50] <Cork> but unless you have high load you most likely don't need it
[03:56:22] <hrusti> ok
[03:56:49] <hrusti> Cork: reffering to cookies
[03:56:54] <hrusti> stealing session
[03:57:26] <hrusti> why couldnt I just send cookie(session) data to my server and then access site as user?
[03:57:46] <Cork> hrusti: sure, how would you get the session key though? :)
[03:58:33] <hrusti> u mean key of https protocol?
[03:58:39] <Cork> no
[03:58:53] <Cork> when you get a session to a server it send an unique identification string
[03:59:04] <Cork> this string is sent to the server to identify the user on each http request
[03:59:12] <Cork> that is how you keep the session
[03:59:45] <hrusti> yes but isn`t key saved in the cookie?
[03:59:55] <Cork> sure, but how would you get to it?
[04:00:10] <Cork> the browser has it for site2, and you are on site1
[04:00:25] <Cork> so unless the browser makes a http call to site2 it won't send the cookie
[04:00:38] <Cork> and site1 can't access the cookie for site2
[04:01:00] <hrusti> neither js?
[04:01:17] <Cork> js runs with exactly the same limitation as normal http
[04:02:45] <hrusti> Cork: ok I understand now :)
[04:03:19] <hrusti> so in your opinion db is fast enough to save session data there also?
[04:03:41] <hrusti> which server need for every request?
[04:04:09] <Cork> depends on number of users, but for a normal site; sure
[04:04:41] <hrusti> cool :)
[04:45:18] <flobin> if I have $.getJSON("../assets/src/data/portfolio-items.json", function( data ) {
[04:45:25] <flobin> how would I go up two folders instead of one?
[04:45:39] <Talon_> ../../
[04:45:39] <Cork> same as with any folder system?
[04:45:48] <flobin> oh thanks!
[04:46:00] <Cork> flobin: also i recommend using absolute paths
[04:46:13] <flobin> Cork: really? why?
[04:46:14] <Cork> relative is tricky if you use the js on multiple places
[04:46:44] <Cork> so it is better for portability to have an absolute path
[04:46:54] <Cork> (meaning starting with /)
[04:55:36] <flobin> so here I am trying to load a json file, but I’m not sure it’s being loaded correctly: http://robinberghuijs.com/handlebars/
[04:55:50] <flobin> this is the top of the script that loads it: https://gist.github.com/Flobin/7956bb4b28df1212fec8
[04:56:51] <flobin> but the first console.log doesn’t do anything and th second shows that the portfolio object is empty
[04:56:54] <Cork> flobin: the path isn't based on where the js is located
[04:56:58] <Cork> but the page the js is loaded on
[04:56:58] <flobin> sorry, array
[04:57:14] <Cork> so again i recommend using "/handlebars/assets/src/data/portfolio-items.json" instead
[04:57:42] <Cork> same for the urls in the json
[04:58:33] <Cork> flobin: also console.log('1 '+portfolio); <-- this forces the object to be a string
[04:58:47] <Cork> use console.log('1', portfolio)
[04:58:59] <flobin> ah right
[04:59:01] <Cork> flobin: and lastly, define your variables
[04:59:09] <Cork> ah, sorry, scratch that
[04:59:19] <Cork> missed the var delcaration outside the ajax call
[04:59:32] <Cork> flobin: ajax is async you can't access the data in line 18
[04:59:51] <Cork> (it won't exist when that line execute
[04:59:52] <Cork> )
[05:00:26] <flobin> right, so does that mean that even if the json loads correctly, the second console log would show the portfolio array as empty?
[05:00:35] <Cork> yes
[05:00:43] <flobin> gotcha
[05:01:00] <flobin> thank you
[05:01:07] <Cork> cause the execution order is 1. request ajax, 2. console.log 2, 3. function exists, 4. console.log 1
[05:01:35] <Cork> and 4a profile = data :)
[05:02:57] <flobin> urgh, I had this thing working, but I changed something which broke it, then I couldn’t remember what it was and wanted to restore a backup from when it worked, but I accidentally overwrote the backup with my broken version
[05:03:04] <flobin> and now I have no idea what I broke :P
[05:03:22] <Cork> ?g git
[05:03:23] <b-ot> Cork: Git → http://git-scm.com/
[05:03:26] <Cork> flobin: ^
[05:03:37] <Cork> prevent that from ever happen again
[05:03:58] <flobin> heh, yeah, I use git, but it was literally a difference of about 2 minutes and I didn’t commit in the meantime
[05:04:00] <Uhkis> forget to commit and you're there again
[05:04:02] <Cork> you don't even have to push it to a third party storage
[05:04:06] <Cork> true
[05:04:13] <flobin> the older backup is way older and I’d have to re-do a bunch of stuff
[05:04:29] <Cork> you tend to develop a tick about git commit -m '' though :)
[05:05:20] <Uhkis> i used to commit often, then some a-hole told me about git commit -p
[05:06:36] <Cork> -p??
[05:06:40] <Cork> that isn't in the man page
[05:06:58] <Uhkis>        -p, --patch
[05:06:58] <Uhkis>            Use the interactive patch selection interface to chose which changes to commit. See git-add(1) for details.
[05:07:01] <Uhkis> yes it is!
[05:07:28] <Cork> i think your thinking about git add -p
[05:07:32] <Cork> not commit -p
[05:07:39] <Cork> an yes add -p is nice
[05:07:42] <Uhkis> same thing
[05:07:43] <Cork> and*
[05:08:00] <Uhkis> but if you commit with -p you dont have to add first :P
[05:08:11] <Cork> uh no cause you have to add the changes to the commit before you can commit them
[05:08:26] <Cork> picking what should be in the commit as you commit it makes no sense
[05:09:15] <Cork> but sure, i use add -p all the time
[05:09:22] <Uhkis> it's a shorthand for "git add -p && git commit"
[05:10:01] <flobin> by the way, Cork, why do you recommend using absolute paths (for JSON)?
[05:10:54] <Cork> flobin: i've already told you
[05:11:05] <Cork> the path doesn't depend on where you write the page
[05:11:09] <flobin> oh I didn’t see, I think my connection died
[05:11:11] <Cork> path
[05:11:16] <Cork> but from where it is loaded
[05:11:21] <flobin> oh, right
[05:11:42] <flobin> I thought you meant something like ‘http://url.com/thing.json'
[05:11:43] <Cork> meaning including app.js in /somehting/other/file.html will look for the .json file in a different locaton then /something/file.html
[05:12:10] <Cork> no no a full url, just an absolute path
[05:12:15] <Cork> *no not
[05:12:21] <flobin> yeah okay
[05:13:06] <Cork> ya, full url has its advantages too, but it becomes a hell to maintain if the url isn't server generated
[05:13:54] <Cork> absolute path is a good inbetween where you get the most important predictability, and still maintainable
[05:18:34] <phrearch> hi
[05:18:38] <flobin> thanks, Cork
[05:19:04] <phrearch> if i have two cached jquery selectors, how can i combine these selectors together into one selector?
[05:19:30] <phrearch> like i want to bind .on to them both, but with one call
[05:21:12] <phrearch> $().add got it :D
[05:25:50] <Cork> phrearch: $() isn't needed, but appart from that, ya
[05:26:02] <Cork> variable1.add(variable2)
[05:26:05] <Cork> should be enough
[05:38:47] <untaken> is there away to recieve a trigger, when a html "number" input type up/down arrow is clicked (ie spinner)?
[05:47:08] <Omar-> !ping arschmitz
[06:08:54] <arschmitz> Omar-: hi
[06:09:09] <Omar-> arschmitz how are you?
[06:09:21] <arschmitz> Omar-: good
[06:09:33] <Omar-> is there a way to override reverse transition on back navigation?
[06:09:39] <Omar-> this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/2hsnkym4/
[06:09:53] <Omar-> I can alter anything except for options.reverse
[06:23:13] <tirengarfio> what is better .on('load', function) or .load(function ??
[06:31:21] <flobin> is there such a thing as a jquery validator?
[06:33:06] <BillCriswell> flobin: About half the questions in here are about it, so yeah I hope so haha.
[06:33:34] <flobin> well I mean, not like a form validator
[06:33:43] <flobin> I mean something jslint.com but specifically for jquery
[06:34:30] <BillCriswell> Oh. I don't believe so.
[06:35:16] <BillCriswell> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-lint/ Looks like someone has done something like it.
[06:35:27] <BillCriswell> Looking pretty dated, though.
[06:35:57] <flobin> so do people validate their jquery? and if so, how?
[06:36:15] <BillCriswell> jQuery is javascript, so valid Javascript is valid jQuery.
[06:36:33] <flobin> sure, but valid jquery is not always valid javascript, is it?
[06:37:09] <BillCriswell> Yes. jQuery is just a library written in Javascript.
[06:38:13] <flobin> right, but I mean, if you have, for instance, $(window).trigger('hashchange’);, that’s not valid js unless you’ve also included jquery
[06:38:19] <flobin> by itself it wouldn’t be valid
[06:38:44] <mbrzuzy> that is valid Javascript though
[06:38:53] <mbrzuzy> whether or not jQuery is included is irrelevant
[06:39:04] <flobin> oh, my bad
[06:39:33] <flobin> what about, $('.page').addClass('invisible’);? don’t you have to define addClass(); first for it to be valid?
[06:41:24] <mbrzuzy> I guess you would have to define what you mean by valid javascirpt
[06:41:50] <mbrzuzy> That would throw an error if you didn't have jQuery included
[06:42:03] <flobin> yeah that’s what I mean
[06:42:47] <mbrzuzy> but that wouldn't be because the javascript is wrong, simply because you didn't include the library
[06:45:00] <fxmulder> anyone know what I might use if I wanted an accordion-style content panel display that takes up its parents full height?  ie resizes all the open content panels when other content panels are opened/closed
[06:52:13] <Hendrikto> Could somebody take a look at this please? http://www.kkandk.de/hendrik/sebastian/home.html#
[06:52:23] <Hendrikto> http://pastebin.com/u2ctTN7W
[06:55:18] <Hendrikto> Wow, found the bug :D I did it right in the description of the problem and wrong on the actual site :D the description I did actually works, I'm stupid, pardon me^^
[07:07:11] <Juslintek> Hey, why I get not console.log .on('selectmenucreate') event
[07:07:40] <Juslintek>     $( '#carousel_{$box}_settings_skyrius' ).on( 'selectmenucreate', function( event, ui ) { console.log(ui); if( ui.item.index > 0 ) { $('#picBrowser$box, #nuotraukos_{$box}_list').hide(); } } );
[07:08:25] <Juslintek> box is from php.
[07:09:12] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: Where is the "selectmenucreate" event coming from?
[07:10:08] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: Googled a bit... is this from jQuery UI's "selectedmenu" ?
[07:10:12] <BillCriswell> selectmenu*
[07:10:34] <Juslintek> $(document).ready(function() { $('.uiSelect').selectmenu().selectmenu('menuWidget').addClass('selectOverflow'); } );
[07:11:05] <BillCriswell> I see .on('selectcreate', ...) but no .on('selectmenucreate', ...);
[07:14:39] <Juslintek> BillCriswell, it doesn't work as well :-)
[07:16:04] <Juslintek> Oh sorry I forgot to mention that is jquery ui :-D
[07:16:18] <Juslintek> I thought guys you'd intuitionally would know :-D
[07:17:09] <Juslintek> So thing is UI trigger isn't called
[07:17:15] <Juslintek> latest version of ui
[07:17:39] <Juslintek> but not jquery, don't know how to rewrite .live events on some scripts.
[07:17:58] <Juslintek> when I change to on all becomes broken and unrespinsive
[07:19:12] <BillCriswell> Just changing .live to .on won't make it work. It's a bit of a different syntax.
[07:19:44] <BillCriswell> $(document).on('click', '.foo', function () { }); vs $('.foo').live('click', function () { });
[07:20:18] <Juslintek> Oh I need to add parent :-)
[07:20:27] <Juslintek> and in on tell child
[07:21:14] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: As for the selectmenu thing, this is all I have to go off of without your code: http://api.jquerymobile.com/selectmenu/#event-create
[07:22:53] <Juslintek> Bill, I gave you code, that is all there is to it. Some select menu with class uiSelect, which is triggered by: $(document).ready(function() { $('.uiSelect').selectmenu().selectmenu('menuWidget').addClass('selectOverflow'); } ); And afterwards in modules there is to all that javascript extra one added:  $( '#carousel_{$box}_settings_skyrius' ).on( 'selectmenucreate', function( event, ui ) { console.log(ui); if( ui.item.index > 0 ) { $('#picBrowser$box,
[07:22:53] <Juslintek>  #nuotraukos_{$box}_list').hide(); } } ); Telling to hide some stuff it its index on load is more then 0
[07:23:51] <Juslintek> And console.log to check out objects structure. And values it hold so I would be sure that index is not the value.
[07:27:40] <BillCriswell> Does your element literally look like <div id="nuotraukos_{$box}_list"> ?
[07:30:23] <Clint0n> Hi all, can anyone see anything wrong with this http://pastebin.com/prCYNai0 ? Not having any luck using the debugger
[07:33:12] <Juslintek> BillCriswell, here compiled code: http://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/jpxbcpd1/1/
[07:34:22] <Juslintek> BillCriswell, sorry, this one: http://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/jpxbcpd1/2/
[07:34:54] <Juslintek> Forgot to remove jquery generated item, this one is generated by jqueryui in realtime
[07:36:14] <Juslintek> only change works, create doesn't
[07:36:20] <draconusdesigns> Quick question I think.
[07:36:34] <draconusdesigns> https://jsfiddle.net/mvhxkgpw/22/
[07:37:01] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: I see I See.
[07:37:32] <Juslintek> In this one, I removed all the unwanted console.logs: http://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/jpxbcpd1/4/
[07:38:12] <draconusdesigns> on line 11-14 when the the boxes that are generated from the select menu are clicked, they are supposed to fire the update dropdown function, but the only way I have found to get the boxes to remove themseves like they should is by adding code to the html onclick event for them, and so they aren't firing the proper function
[07:38:20] <draconusdesigns> Any ideas where i am going wrong?
[07:39:09] <chargen> Hi. Is it possible the get event.screenX in a setTimeout function with the value when it is executed instead of the one when the timeout is called?
[07:39:45] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: It's because it's already created.
[07:40:09] <Juslintek> BillCriswell, then how to check onload of that?
[07:40:14] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: http://jsfiddle.net/jpxbcpd1/6/
[07:40:18] <BillCriswell> onload of what?
[07:40:42] <BillCriswell> You mean like when the menu opens up?
[07:41:24] <Juslintek> BillCriswell, I get that, but in my case all selects are globally invoked. But I want to override that and add extra checkup.
[07:41:44] <BillCriswell> Not sure what checkup is.
[07:42:04] <Juslintek> I want to know the value select will get before its loaded. So I could hide the browse on load if selectmenu has value
[07:42:09] <Juslintek> checkup is listening
[07:42:41] <Juslintek> Checking if somthing is up
[07:43:52] <Juslintek> So my point is to hide browse on load, if select has value higher then 0
[07:44:44] <Juslintek> I can ofcourse do that with php, but. Why load server when I can load the clients machine :-D
[07:47:47] <Khuilso> Hello  guys!!
[07:47:47] <Khuilso> var list = $('#items')[0];
[07:48:19] <Khuilso> in this line what do the [0]
[07:48:37] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: You can use the selectmenucreate listener BEFORE you init the plugin.
[07:48:49] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/jpxbcpd1/9/
[07:49:03] <BillCriswell> Khuilso: It gets the DOM element instead of the jQuery object.
[07:49:24] <BillCriswell> Well, gets the DOM element from a jQuery object.
[07:49:48] <Khuilso> BillCriswell > but it get that id selector?
[07:50:22] <BillCriswell> $('#items')[0] is about the same of document.getElementById('items');
[07:50:35] <Juslintek> BillCriswell, gotit I just add display: none on php, if that value is not empty. I don't want to add variable scripts on global js before select is loaded globally, if I can't override it locally.
[07:51:36] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[07:53:08] <Khuilso> ok. thank you
[07:53:24] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:54:41] <Trindaz> content editable text areas. I want a simple one just so that I can display emojis along with text. I don't want to actually edit fonts and whatnot.
[07:54:45] <Trindaz> what should I use for that?
[07:56:46] <Es0teric> has anyone here used selectizejs?
[07:59:59] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I have I think? Is that the one that adds useful selectors to shitty browsers?
[08:00:13] <Es0teric> BillCriswell http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/
[08:00:33] <BillCriswell> Oh, I was thinking http://selectivizr.com/
[08:00:44] <BillCriswell> Really need some different names devs.
[08:00:50] <Es0teric> lol BillCriswell
[08:01:44] <BillCriswell> I haven't. Looks snazzy though.
[08:01:48] <BillCriswell> I've used Chosen.
[08:02:00] <BillCriswell> http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[08:03:14] <Es0teric> BillCriswell i have already implemented selectize in various parts of this project already
[08:03:31] <Es0teric> my only problem is that its not deleting the values that are already in place
[08:04:04] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Demo?
[08:04:16] <Es0teric> BillCriswell in the link i sent you, i am using the "tag" version
[08:04:44] <BillCriswell> tagging?
[08:04:51] <Es0teric> BillCriswell yeah
[08:04:59] <Es0teric> but i am using <select> instead of <input>
[08:05:18] <draconusdesigns> Anyone?
[08:05:35] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: It seems to really want an <input> tag.
[08:05:43] <Es0teric> yeah i see
[08:06:56] <BillCriswell> Looks like Chosen has that built in to work with <select>
[08:07:52] <patteh> i'm trying to inject a div into a page using append, but with no joy
[08:07:57] <patteh> is my syntax incorrect?
[08:08:00] <patteh> $( '.front-layer' ).append( '<div class="coverpage"><h1>Charles David James</h1></div>' );
[08:08:15] <BillCriswell> patteh: Yes.
[08:08:34] <patteh> BillCriswell what have i done wrong?
[08:08:39] <BillCriswell> Make sure front-layer exiests when you try to append it, do like console.log($('.front-layer').length);
[08:08:47] <patteh> aha
[08:08:55] <patteh> i am injecting in header as i have no other choice
[08:09:02] <BillCriswell> If you're loading .front-layout via AJAX you'll have to wait till it's loaded before doing that.
[08:09:10] <patteh> wrap in dom ready
[08:09:11] <patteh> ?
[08:09:20] <BillCriswell> patteh: Ok, so however you're injecting that you'll need to use the callback.
[08:09:27] <BillCriswell> How are you injecting the header?
[08:09:50] <patteh> its squarespace
[08:09:54] <patteh> a cms/designer framework
[08:10:07] <patteh> horrible, just gives me an area to inject into header
[08:10:57] <patteh> works with dom ready
[08:11:02] <patteh> ty BillCriswell
[08:11:18] <BillCriswell> patteh: Ok, but be careful cause it might not always.
[08:18:05] <draconusdesigns> :(
[08:19:55] <BillCriswell> draconusdesigns: Make up a quick demo on jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[08:20:06] <draconusdesigns> I did. I pasted it here
[08:20:10] <draconusdesigns> https://jsfiddle.net/mvhxkgpw/22/
[08:20:11] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[08:20:13] <draconusdesigns> :D
[08:20:40] <draconusdesigns> That was the reason I was so surprised noone even said a word to me. I am patient as long as I know i was noticed :P
[08:21:01] <draconusdesigns> I know it is a gift to have another dev look over one of my issues.
[08:21:08] <draconusdesigns> So thank you.
[08:21:52] <draconusdesigns> when you click the options in the multiple select, it adds li items for each, you can drag them to sort them.
[08:21:54] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:22:16] <sureshscribnar> I am doing jquery validation with remote method, with JSONP as I am calling a cross domain. The JSONP callback is being executed but jquery validator method success is not being executed..http://pastebin.com/bN81e6wQ
[08:22:17] <sureshscribnar> 
[08:22:22] <sureshscribnar> can anyone throw some light please? Tx
[08:22:46] <draconusdesigns> When I close one of them with it's red x, or deselect one in the dropdown, they should go away. That is the general gist of my project.
[08:24:06] <draconusdesigns> The issue is at the moment, when I click the red x, I can't get the function to fire called update_dropdown_options, which is where I intend to put the code to deselect the associated dropdown item.
[08:24:24] <draconusdesigns> So i am about 75% of the way there, just a few little issues.
[08:24:25] <nonconvergent> Can someone help me with the jquery validator? https://gist.github.com/nonconvergent/77edaf923deff936b338 minlength isn't triggering.
[08:25:18] <BillCriswell> draconusdesigns: You're looking for .remove-item, but the class is just .remove, so that's the first problem but after that you'll see that you need to use event delegation on those links since they're dynamic.
[08:25:25] <BillCriswell> draconusdesigns: https://jsfiddle.net/mvhxkgpw/23/ this should get you much closer.
[08:26:12] <draconusdesigns> Oh, nice. Thanks :)
[08:26:18] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:26:34] <draconusdesigns> This is great.
[08:26:50] <BillCriswell> Yeah, no inline js =)
[08:27:30] <sureshscribnar> Can anyone answer my question on jquery Validation for remote method please? The success method is not being called.
[08:28:27] <sureshscribnar> Error is not being shown for a field even though remote method returns false.
[08:28:39] <jop008> Hi fokes I have jqmobile page with a table it takes more than 100% and no horizontal scroll bar
[08:29:04] <jop008> is a table not maximized by its screen width?
[08:30:17] <sureshscribnar> Got disconnected.
[08:30:30] <sureshscribnar> Any answers Plz? Sorry to ask again.
[08:31:59] <jop008> sounds like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9993881/large-html-table-with-jquery-mobile
[08:39:30] <jop008> this is my code  <table data-role="table" id="table-column-toggle" data-filter="true" data-input="#filterTable-input" data-mode="columntoggle"  class="ui-responsive table-stroke">
[08:39:54] <jop008> on chrome 23 inch screen it is wider than the screen how to cope with this?
[08:42:40] <BillCriswell> jop008: I always liked just wrapping a table in a div and allowed the user to scroll side to side.
[08:43:04] <jop008> but how?
[08:43:11] <jop008> I tried that also
[08:43:19] <jop008> I have no scroll bars
[08:43:50] <BillCriswell> Did you set the correct css?
[08:44:23] <jop008> define correct css?
[08:44:33] <jop008> I googled and tried a lot of flavors
[08:44:46] <jop008> the table has column toggle
[08:45:01] <jop008> when I zoom out I can see the table
[08:51:44] <jop008> Bill what is good css for a 100% jq mobile table?
[08:51:56] <jop008> or give scrollbars horizontally
[08:52:08] <jop008> I tried with media queries also
[08:54:39] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsbin.com/?html,output this was my though process. I'd make the "shadow"s dynamic based on if you can scroll further in whatever direction.
[08:54:50] <Omar-> jop008 what's your issue with jqm?
[08:56:21] <Omar-> arschmitz if you are here, please check this  http://jsfiddle.net/2hsnkym4/
[08:56:45] <Omar-> reverse cant be set to false when direction is back
[09:08:32] <[Non]> http://jsfiddle.net/8u344ccs/ hey i have a logic like this
[09:08:40] <robertmaxrees> just one logic?
[09:09:00] <[Non]> :D
[09:09:19] <[Non]> its a little tabbed content
[09:13:33] <robertmaxrees> [Non] might want to fix that so it's a functioning fiddle.
[09:18:56] * Omar- sneezes
[09:21:01] <tirengarfio> how can I detect an image has been added like this?       $('.image-container').html('<img id="blah" src="' + reader.result + '" alt="">');
[09:21:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[09:24:07] <joephilly> I have a form #Customer_Support with an input type="image" and src="stuff" that is basically the submit button. How do I prevent default behavior so it doesn't submiT?
[09:24:34] <robertmaxrees> bind to the form's submit event and run preventDefault() against the submit event.
[09:24:42] <joephilly> doesn't work
[09:24:49] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[09:25:29] <joephilly> yeah, that doesn't do it, robbyoconnor
[09:25:33] <joephilly> ** robertmaxrees
[09:25:41] <robertmaxrees> then your code is wrong.
[09:25:43] <robertmaxrees> paste it up.
[09:26:05] <jop008> http://jsbin.com/?html,output shows nothing
[09:27:13] <joephilly> http://pastebin.com/WnnTe7bs
[09:27:36] <robertmaxrees> and the js is in a document ready?
[09:27:47] <joephilly> yes
[09:27:57] <robertmaxrees> then something else is up.  fiddle it pls :)
[09:29:08] <tirengarfio> I expected "Image was loaded" was thrown here: http://jsfiddle.net/yymajb5d/1/
[09:30:18] <robertmaxrees> you can't bind to something that doesn't yet exist, tirengarfio
[09:30:25] <robertmaxrees> and the load event doesn't bubble correctly.
[09:31:06] <tirengarfio> any alternative?
[09:32:03] <robertmaxrees> what problem are you actually trying to solve?
[09:32:23] <robertmaxrees> becuase you could directly add an event handler to the code itself before adding it to the page, but that's not usually what you want.
[09:33:57] <cusco> hi folks
[09:34:13] <tirengarfio> I have to detect when an image is added to the dom. I think I will use this: http://jsfiddle.net/yymajb5d/2/
[09:34:29] <cusco> trying to clone a element, and am using clone.find('[id']).eatch(...) to change the id
[09:34:31] <robertmaxrees> tirengarfio that's a bad idea.
[09:34:37] <tirengarfio> why?
[09:34:45] <cusco> can I keep on adding .find().each() for other attributes?
[09:34:45] <robertmaxrees> any change that modifies the document will fire that.
[09:35:13] <robertmaxrees> cusco change the id before adding it.
[09:35:25] <robertmaxrees> tirengarfio just put your code after the append.
[09:35:29] <cusco> hm
[09:36:15] <joephilly> robertmaxrees, I simplified it enough somehow that it works.... not sure what I "fixed" though, lol
[09:36:28] <tirengarfio> robertmaxrees, what does it change respect to using html() ?
[09:36:39] <robertmaxrees> tirengarfio huh?
[09:36:43] <robertmaxrees> joephilly that's a good place to start :)
[09:37:09] <tirengarfio> here im using html(): http://jsfiddle.net/yymajb5d/3/
[09:37:19] <thomasgriffin> I've got an issue that I'm not sure how to solve. I want to make a jSONP request cacheable server-side. This means I need to rid of the '_' automatically added by jQuery. However, if I set cache to true for the request, it caches it browser side, which means updates on the server wont be reflected in the browser.
[09:37:24] <tirengarfio> you sais I should use append, how exactly?
[09:37:25] <robertmaxrees> tirengarfio right.  then put the code you want to fire after that .html() call.
[09:37:27] <thomasgriffin> Is there any way around this in jQuery?
[09:37:46] <robertmaxrees> thomas set cache to false.
[09:37:54] <thomasgriffin> even if I specify my own callback, it still appends the _ if cache is set to false
[09:38:04] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't seem right,
[09:38:05] <thomasgriffin> which means I can't cache the URL because it will always be different
[09:38:31] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't modify the URL at all in that case.
[09:38:33] <tirengarfio> it is a load() function, should I wrap the load() function in another function, and call it after html() ?
[09:38:59] <robertmaxrees> tirengarfio no, because the load function won't bind to the element correctly.
[09:39:18] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/yymajb5d/4/
[09:39:20] <robertmaxrees> just do this.
[09:39:23] <lvegerano-work> Can anyone help me with a syntax error. Don't really see it. http://hastebin.com/mulasoqihu.pas

[10:03:59] <anli> Hello, is there some irc channel for kendo ui?
[10:06:55] <Cork> ?g kendo ui irc
[10:06:55] <b-ot> Cork: Kendo UI Forums - Telerik Community → http://www.telerik.com/forums/kendo-ui

[10:12:41] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery click

[10:26:30] <jop008> IN jqmobile is the event model changed I try to trap an onclik button
[10:27:13] <robertmaxrees> not sure what that question means.
[10:27:52] <tirengarfio> robertmaxrees, you told not to use DOMSubtreeModified , because "any change that modifies the document will fire that", but in what case exactly? could you give me an example? I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/yymajb5d/5/ and it seems it distinguish it you click hello or hla
[10:27:54] <tirengarfio> hola
[10:28:26] <robertmaxrees> tirengarfio sure - right, now what happens if your callback code changes the document there, as well?
[10:28:39] <robertmaxrees> all you really need is to put your code after the .html call.
[10:50:41] <ajf-> can I reject an $.ajax promise from the .done() function so that it triggers the .fail() handler? For example, if I can't parse the data correctly
[10:51:43] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[10:51:58] <robertmaxrees> once it's resolved or rejected, you can't change it.
[10:52:33] <ajf-> ah ok
[10:57:46] <dcherman> ajf-: you can if you use .then ( sort of ), but it won't hit your fail handler - you'd need to structure your code using specced promise methods.  here's a trivial example: https://gist.github.com/dcherman/9c5d5058f579fd6857ba
[11:00:45] <ajf-> thanks dcherman
[11:01:52] <ajf-> I'm having a problem here... I'm using $.when($.get().done(), $.get().done()).fail(), but the .done that belong to the $get promises are being triggered before the .fail()
[11:02:05] <ajf-> is this normal? supposedly $.when() waits until all the promises are done no?
[11:02:30] <robertmaxrees> the .when() is cared about whatever you're returning from those .done() calls.
[11:03:20] <ajf-> robertmaxrees: what should I return ? true/false?
[11:03:35] <robertmaxrees> a promise that you resolve/reject.
[11:03:42] <robertmaxrees> $.when() expects promises.
[11:04:09] <dcherman> robertmaxrees: you're thinking of `then` - `.done` just returns the existing promise, it doesn't have the filtering capabilities of `.then`
[11:04:25] <robertmaxrees> i could have that mixed up.
[11:04:39] <robertmaxrees> but the .done() callbacks in his case would fire before the .fail() regardless, right?
[11:04:49] <ajf-> that's what I'm getting
[11:04:55] <draconusdesigns> Here is what I have at this point, which appears to be working as it should:
[11:05:00] <draconusdesigns> https://jsfiddle.net/mvhxkgpw/27/
[11:05:18] <draconusdesigns> Figured you would like to take a look at the final product in a matter of speaking.
[11:05:26] <ajf-> robertmaxrees: .done appends some dom elements, and .fail cleans up the whole wrapper and puts an error there. Sometimes I get the error and then below some dom elements appended.
[11:05:40] <ajf-> like if one of the .done callbacks had executed after the .fail
[11:06:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm out of it this morning so i'll let dcherman speak to that.
[11:06:51] <draconusdesigns> The idea is, that I can apply a class to a multiselect, and then users can select the options they want, then they can drag sort them if they wish as well; On form submit, it will push a json array back of the id's and sort order of the objects (this is the textbox values in this example)
[11:07:52] <fxmulder> anyone know what I might use if I wanted an accordion-style content panel display that takes up its parents full height?  ie resizes all the open content panels when other content panels are opened/closed
[11:07:58] <dcherman> ajf-: the done will be executing before your fail since that's the order in which you've defined them - do you have an example of what you're trying to do?
[11:09:40] <ajf-> dcherman: it's just an array of ids being mapped to urls that fetch a json object with data for each id. Before fetching, a loading indicator is added. All of the .get have a callback that adds the returned elements, and when all is done, the loading indicator is removed OR the error indicator is shown. Here's the code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b94ff091b97cd00cb3f1
[11:25:18] <dcherman> ajf-: that case could potentially happen if one of the promises are rejected which immediately rejects the promise that $.when generates, then subsequently one of the other promises in the array is successfully resolved
[11:26:35] <dcherman> ajf-: simple solution is do your domManip in a handler attached to the $.when promise rather than the ones passed to it
[11:36:54] <Guest56602> hello
[11:44:17] <robertmaxrees> Helluva day
[11:48:26] <[Non]> how to optimize large res, big img for web?
[11:48:54] <[Non]> kraken's  mb limit is too low
[11:49:11] <Cork> [Non]: you can't really optimize high ress images for the web
[11:49:23] <[Non]> but it loads.. like... forever
[11:49:26] <Cork> what format is the image in?
[11:49:31] <[Non]> jpg
[11:49:39] <Cork> [Non]: well that is larg images for you
[11:49:48] <Cork> [Non]: not much you can do then
[11:49:57] <Cork> except reducing resolution
[11:50:02] <[Non]> hmm
[11:50:05] <robertmaxrees> and compressing.
[11:50:25] <Cork> you mean zlib?
[11:50:29] <robertmaxrees> imagemagick
[11:50:35] <Cork> hmm
[11:50:43] <Cork> ah wait, you could try mozjpg
[11:50:48] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[11:50:56] <Cork> i's suppose to be one of the best out there
[11:51:00] <Cork> ?g mozjpg
[11:51:01] <b-ot> Cork: Mozilla introduces mozjpg helps reduce size of jpeg images → http://smashingweb.info/mozilla-introduces-mozjpg-helps-reduce-size-jpeg-images/
[11:51:01] <[Non]> i am looking to it
[11:51:01] <robertmaxrees> you can usuaully drop to around 75-70% quality before you'll notice anything.
[11:51:15] <robertmaxrees> also make sure you actually need the image to be the resolution it's at.
[11:51:48] <Cork> ya, reducing resolution is your absolutely best way to reduce the size
[11:52:11] <robertmaxrees> people think you gain something from squeezing 1920 x 1080 size images when they're only going to display them in a 600px tall spot.
[11:52:57] <Cork> i've seen sites that use width/height for thumbnails (never use the full image)
[11:53:03] <Cork> that makes me sad >_>
[11:53:23] <robertmaxrees> there is a side benefit to using the full image there
[11:53:33] <robertmaxrees> but it's not necessarily what you always want.
[11:54:04] <Cork> to some degree sure, but there are limits
[11:54:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:54:16] <robertmaxrees> all about tradeoffs.
[11:54:56] <Cork> if i remember correctly it was like a 4k image used as a thumbnail in a blog, where something like a 500x600 would have worked just fine
[11:55:04] <Cork> so 1000x1200 at most but 4k...
[11:55:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's overkill.
[11:55:41] <Cork> and this was a few years ago so before iris was a thing
[11:55:57] <robertmaxrees> iris or retina?
[11:56:04] <Cork> opps ya retina
[11:56:36] <fxmulder> anyone know what I might use if I wanted an accordion-style content panel display that takes up its parents full height?  ie resizes all the open content panels when other content panels are opened/closed
[11:56:56] <Cork> i also remember from way back when ppl actually mistakenly thought <img width="50" height="50" reduced the images size :)
[11:57:02] <Cork> as in less data needed
[11:57:08] <robertmaxrees> Cork i know people who still think that.
[11:57:13] <Cork> ugg
[11:57:17] <robertmaxrees> fxmulder iirc there's an option to do that with JQUI but i could be wrong.
[11:59:55] <SeeThruHead_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/10505662/ can anyone help me out with this ajax request
[12:00:31] <robertmaxrees> what do you need help with?
[12:00:44] <fxmulder> robertmaxrees: the jqui accordion doesn't seem like it can have more than one panel active at a time
[12:00:54] <robertmaxrees> fxmulder ah that.  hrmmm
[12:04:24] <Cork> fxmulder: it should be easy enough to write from scratch
[12:04:44] <Cork> a simple header with a click handle and a .slideToggle should do it fine
[12:09:27] <lvegerano-work> can someone help me position a tooltip centered to an element? http://jsfiddle.net/g4vj6rzj/
[12:11:54] <robertmaxrees> lvegerano-work you need to grab the height of the tooltip, divide it by two, then subtract that resultant number from your current top value.
[12:12:14] <Cork> note that the tooltip won't have a height before it gets added to the dom
[12:12:51] <lvegerano-work> ah so should define the height then
[12:12:56] <lvegerano-work> Ill give that a shot
[12:13:05] <robertmaxrees> that... is not what i said.
[12:13:30] <Cork> lvegerano-work: you could append the tooltip and then set the top value
[12:13:42] <Cork> you just have to change the order you do things a little
[12:13:52] <lvegerano-work> k
[12:14:32] <robertmaxrees> and add in math for the css offset stuff.
[12:14:54] <lvegerano-work> will give that a try thanks
[12:14:55] <Cork> lvegerano-work: you could also just have it be a child of the <a> tag and let css deal with it
[12:15:49] <lvegerano-work> Cork: yeah maybe that is a bit simpler
[12:16:36] <Cork> if you can use css3 transform it would make things even simpler
[12:17:37] <lvegerano-work> Cork: kinda restricted boss is a PITA and I would have to use shims for older browsers
[12:18:06] <Cork> lvegerano-work: there isn't really shims for transform
[12:18:23] <Cork> unlss you mean js code
[12:18:36] <lvegerano-work> oh well need to support ie 8+
[12:18:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you'll need the solution i pointed out.
[12:18:58] <Cork> and those tend to be slow for complex properties like transform (and much of it isn't even possible)
[12:19:03] <Cork> ya
[12:19:16] <Cork> if you need ie pre 10 js is the only solution
[12:19:49] <lvegerano-work> yeah so robertmaxrees solution Id have to append then recalculate the top
[12:20:02] <robertmaxrees> just move the .css() call.
[12:20:08] <robertmaxrees> and then do the calc.
[12:20:32] <lvegerano-work> gotcha
[12:29:04] <lvegerano-work> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/g4vj6rzj/2/ is this what you meant?
[12:41:00] <lvegerano-work> Cork: could you look at this http://jsfiddle.net/g4vj6rzj/2/ Do I really have to set a timeout to grab the element height?
[12:45:12] <Cork> lvegerano-work: http://jsfiddle.net/g4vj6rzj/3/
[12:46:40] <lvegerano-work> Cork: thanks I thought I had tried that =-O and did not work... meh
[12:48:39] <joephilly> is there a way I can filter the jquery docs to be 1.4.1?
[12:48:52] <joephilly> makes it really difficult when it keeps resetting
[12:51:26] <alessadro26> Hi guys, I have a question "How to avoid overwrite selection in HTML file input?" - http://stackoverflow.com/q/28813813/4246579
[12:52:34] <Mnhuigh> http://jsfiddle.net/v3fo9gfy/
[12:52:55] <Mnhuigh> how can I to set two different functions y the same .set here
[12:52:58] <Mnhuigh> ?
[12:55:28] <SeeThruHead_> anyone know why var postForm = $.post(ajaxSubmitTarget, $.params(data)); isn't giving me the same result as when i put the url + querystring into the browser manually
[12:55:41] <joephilly> because you're posting
[12:55:50] <joephilly> instead of getting
[12:56:32] <SeeThruHead_> ok but if i use postman and select post it gives me back the json
[12:56:57] <alessadro26> sorry, what is postman?
[12:57:28] <joephilly> postman is like fiddler for chrome
[12:58:08] <alessadro26> does firebug not have these features?
[12:58:29] <joephilly> I doubt it
[12:58:33] <joephilly> it's a chrome extension
[12:59:48] <SeeThruHead_> ihave a feeling that the params are not getting sent properly, how can i check the exact url+query string form inside the ajax call
[12:59:52] <joephilly> how do I use $.ajax() syncrhonously in 1.4.1?
[13:00:10] <joephilly> SeeThruHead_, download Fiddler2 and spy on what is happening. It's not that hard man :)
[13:00:29] <SeeThruHead_> never heard of it
[13:02:42] <joephilly> SeeThruHead_, I just told you about it. Go hear of it
[13:03:31] <SeeThruHead_> asshole
[13:04:09] <robertmaxrees> woah
[13:04:43] <robertmaxrees> joephilly that's code smell.
[13:05:06] <joephilly> robertmaxrees, what is?
[13:05:12] <robertmaxrees> running ajax sync.
[13:05:37] <joephilly> how else would I do it? I need to block a form post, get some info using ajax, then continue posting form
[13:05:52] <joephilly> I guess it doesn't have to be async but I need default bahavior to be blocked
[13:05:56] <joephilly> *sync
[13:05:57] <robertmaxrees> stop the submit event, get your data, then submit the furm.
[13:06:00] <alessadro26> robertmaxrees: you have a minute to read this? http://stackoverflow.com/q/28813813/4246579
[13:06:51] <robertmaxrees> alessadro26 there's an event for 'click' you can bind to and then see what the user clicked on.
[13:07:07] <robertmaxrees> alessadro26 it looks like what you really want is multiple file inputs, yeah?
[13:07:27] <alessadro26> robertmaxrees: It is true !, I had not thought of that. But what I say is logical? ie, you can do what I want?
[13:08:03] <alessadro26> robertmaxrees: yes, multiple files selected from multiple directories, I need append feature
[13:08:16] <robertmaxrees> i'm not entirely sure.  my gut says "no" but that might not be 100% accurate.
[13:08:56] <robertmaxrees> https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ can do exactly what you want.
[13:09:03] <seba_> Hello, I believe I found a bug in jquery ui resizable. If the css elements are box-sizing:border-box, and the resizable element has containment and a border, then you can not resize to the full size of the container. See: http://jsfiddle.net/4Vfm5/1123/
[13:09:18] <seba_> can somebody verify this is a bug, and not me doing something wrong before I report it in the bug tracker?
[13:09:29] <robertmaxrees> seba_ i'd ask in the jquery ui chat.
[13:09:33] <alessadro26> robertmaxrees: I'm using this http://plugins.krajee.com/file-input/demo#ajax-uploads
[13:09:34] <robertmaxrees> #jqueryui-dev
[13:09:53] <alessadro26> This plugin allows the Append, but there is a problem
[13:09:57] <robertmaxrees> alessadro26 that's a broken page.
[13:11:07] <alessadro26> robertmaxrees: https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-fileinput
[13:11:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah i found it.
[13:12:25] <alessadro26> Ok, the problem is that I want to do a resize the images before sending. And I do not send them one by one and less than an asynchronous way, I send all form data together.
[13:12:44] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure you need ajax to do multiple files in one shot.
[13:12:50] <robertmaxrees> but i could be wrong.
[13:12:58] <robertmaxrees> and don't resize on the client - resize on the server.
[13:15:18] <alessadro26> robertmaxrees: you are right about ajax upload, but about resizing, I Need to do a resize on the client, so that the user does not awit much time; here in Venezuela average internet connection is 1Megabit / second :(
[13:15:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd set a hard limit on how large of an image they can update instead.
[13:15:41] <robertmaxrees> *upload.
[13:15:49] <alessadro26> For resize I'm using this http://jsfiddle.net/r5h7su8u/
[13:15:57] <robertmaxrees> or toss a warning telling them it can take a while.
[13:17:51] <alessadro26> No, I want to do the resize on the client side,
[13:18:15] <alessadro26> You think there's a plugin that can display the thumbnails of the images and do a resize photos before sending them? and also that allows the append feature?
[13:18:34] <robertmaxrees> you can't do append without ajax iirc.
[13:18:45] <robertmaxrees> so that's going to be out of the question.
[13:20:50] <alessadro26> https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ allows append without doing with ajax?
[13:21:29] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure that requires ajax.
[13:21:56] <robertmaxrees> ah wait.
[13:22:05] <robertmaxrees> your basic idea is right.
[13:22:08] <robertmaxrees> you CAN do that.
[13:22:11] <robertmaxrees> i stand corrected.
[13:22:44] <alessadro26> Uhh, well, the problem is that I need to send all the data together to associate with the same ID (Last Insert Id) all data, and can not send the photos before or after. Am I explained well?
[13:22:57] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:23:01] <alessadro26> And excuse my horrible way to write english
[13:23:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying you can do multi-file upload without ajax - that is possible.
[13:23:14] <robertmaxrees> i thought it wasn't.
[13:23:43] <alessadro26> You refireres to https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ ?
[13:24:04] <robertmaxrees> that might support it - i'm not sure.
[13:24:07] <robertmaxrees> i'll looking at it more.
[13:24:40] <robertmaxrees> http://davidwalsh.name/multiple-file-upload this is the basic gist with php.
[13:24:46] <robertmaxrees> should be easily translatable.
[13:24:56] <robertmaxrees> could test the blueimp solution, too.
[13:27:05] <alessadro26> robertmaxrees: Well, I'll try to implement BlueImp with my crazy restrictions. Thanks for the information :-)
[13:27:19] <robertmaxrees> sure - sorry i couldn't be of more help.  i'd give it a shot.
[14:14:45] <lvegerano-work> Im trying to append a simple span and is not working http://jsfiddle.net/o95z8o6n/3/ WTF!
[14:15:18] <lvegerano-work> shit got it
[14:15:30] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:15:52] <lvegerano-work> im trying to replicate an issue
[14:16:01] <robertmaxrees> let me guess.
[14:16:05] <lvegerano-work> for another question lol
[14:16:10] <robertmaxrees> the new A tags don't work right?
[14:16:17] <lvegerano-work> nah
[14:16:49] <lvegerano-work> removing appended elements if they exist
[14:17:40] <lvegerano-work> doing rootElement.find(child).fadeOut() was not working very well
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what you're going for.
[14:18:30] <lvegerano-work> you know those tooltips from before... I want only one in the page
[14:18:59] <robertmaxrees> do they have a shared class?
[14:19:14] <lvegerano-work> so I one is open and the user clicks another link to open another tooltip the prev open should close
[14:19:17] <lvegerano-work> yes
[14:19:50] <robertmaxrees> $('.yourTooltipClass').hide(); then .show() the tooltip you wnat.
[14:19:58] <robertmaxrees> however you tie them together.
[14:20:21] <lvegerano-work> hmm so im trying to complicate my life...
[14:20:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:20:45] <lvegerano-work> Im rusty with my jquery/frond-end skills
[14:20:51] <lvegerano-work> lol
[14:20:53] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to find all of them that aren't the current one - just hide all of them at once, then unhide the one your care about
[14:21:14] <lvegerano-work> well that makes so much sense
[14:24:35] <lvegerano-work> it sorta works check this out http://jsfiddle.net/o95z8o6n/5/
[14:25:12] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[14:25:50] <lvegerano-work> incomplete example one sec
[14:28:27] <lvegerano-work> http://jsfiddle.net/o95z8o6n/6/ if you click pretty fast the fadeOut happens but not the append... maybe some race condition
[14:28:47] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.,
[14:28:57] <robertmaxrees> check to see if the current one is already open first.
[14:29:53] <lvegerano-work> that is what if (!el.hasClass('is-appended')) does
[14:30:55] <robertmaxrees> you need to remove that class in the callback of the fadeout
[14:31:06] <lvegerano-work> ah
[14:31:09] <robertmaxrees> also, fadeOut() doesn't delete anything.
[14:31:16] <robertmaxrees> you're creating a new span every time youy click.
[14:31:26] <lvegerano-work> gotcha
[15:18:09] <lambdumb> i have a page using jquery ui tabs; what's the smartest way to password protect them? SQL database + php with calls to show/hide the tabs?
[15:18:32] <robertmaxrees> password protect the page they're on.
[15:18:50] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, hide the content of the tabs behind an ajax call that requires authentication
[15:18:59] <lambdumb> different levels of access will open different tabs
[15:19:24] <lambdumb> ajax calls can do authentication?
[15:19:41] <robertmaxrees> in more recent browsers, yeah.
[15:20:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, only render out the tabs that the user has access to.
[15:22:15] <lambdumb> alright, seems interesting
[15:47:10] <tgr225> Can anyone help me with a basic jquery issue?
[15:47:26] <robertmaxrees> tgr225 yes
[15:47:28] <robertmaxrees> just ask.
[15:48:08] <tgr225> This is what the end result should be
[15:48:09] <tgr225> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7JWfzOhqNgNMFJPQ01EbzBJTlE/view?pli=1
[15:48:39] <tgr225> JSBin where I'm supposed to work from
[15:48:40] <tgr225> http://jsbin.com/rigoy/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[15:48:58] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:49:06] <robertmaxrees> first off, open your browser's developer tools.
[15:49:49] <robertmaxrees> i saw an error in there on pageload.
[15:50:17] <robertmaxrees> weird it's gone.
[15:50:21] <robertmaxrees> anyway - what's your question?
[15:50:36] <tgr225> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f4ed2d271e7d931ecd0f
[15:50:40] <tgr225> This is as far as I've gotten
[15:50:59] <robertmaxrees> update the bin...
[15:51:37] <tgr225> http://jsbin.com/salefiqulu/2/
[15:51:50] <robertmaxrees> okay./
[15:52:10] <robertmaxrees> so you're just trying to make a basic to-do list, right?
[15:52:11] <tgr225> http://jsbin.com/salefiqulu/2/watch?html,css,js,output
[15:52:13] <tgr225> Yes
[15:53:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/dewoxaraku/1/edit?html,js,output
[15:53:45] <robertmaxrees> this takes out all the extra stuff you don't need.
[15:54:17] <tgr225> roger
[15:57:43] <robertmaxrees> okay, so first things first, you've got e.add();
[15:57:53] <robertmaxrees> e is the "event object" you don't want that.
[15:58:00] <robertmaxrees> so you can basically kill that line.
[15:58:06] <tgr225> alright
[15:58:09] <robertmaxrees> same with the div.secret show thin.
[15:58:17] <robertmaxrees> *thing
[15:58:49] <robertmaxrees> so for now you should just have one line left.
[16:00:04] <tgr225> alright
[16:00:34] <robertmaxrees> so now you're adding a new li every time you click right?
[16:00:41] <tgr225> Yes
[16:02:44] <robertmaxrees> so what's the next part then?
[16:02:47] <robertmaxrees> (walk through it :)
[16:03:13] <tgr225> I haven't the slightest idea
[16:03:31] <robertmaxrees> well, you're appending those li's, right?
[16:03:36] <tgr225> corerct
[16:03:37] <robertmaxrees> what's missing from them?
[16:03:40] <tgr225> isn't the the append()
[16:03:42] <tgr225> that the
[16:04:05] <tgr225> or missing input
[16:04:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:04:24] <tgr225> I'm pretty lost
[16:04:48] <robertmaxrees> the stuff you're appending doesn't have any text in it, right?
[16:05:08] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have right now.
[16:05:21] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:05:45] <tgr225> http://jsbin.com/salefiqulu/3/edit
[16:07:37] <Ivo> On this page, only the very last solution header shows a button to reveal it. https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/simple_drawing.html
[16:07:51] <Ivo> it's using this script: https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/_static/spoilers.js
[16:08:32] <Ivo> Except, that script used to work fine - it would add a show / hide button for each solution. Does anyone know why it's not working any longer?
[16:09:03] <robertmaxrees> back.
[16:09:22] <tgr225> http://jsbin.com/rigoy/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[16:09:24] <robertmaxrees> tgr225 okay, so kill the form tag
[16:09:42] <tgr225> alright
[16:10:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/kukagosuri/1/edit?html,js,output you should wind up with something like this: http://jsbin.com/kukagosuri/1/edit?html,js,output
[16:10:35] <tgr225> right
[16:10:57] <robertmaxrees> cool.  okay, so you probably want the text that was entered put into that LI, right?
[16:11:02] <tgr225> correct
[16:11:42] <robertmaxrees> okay, so to do that, you need to grab the value of the text input.
[16:11:51] <robertmaxrees> so start with a jquery selector of the input.
[16:13:01] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got for that.
[16:13:08] <tgr225> var jobValue = document.getElementById('name').value
[16:13:09] <tgr225> ?
[16:13:29] <robertmaxrees> use a jquery selector for it instead.
[16:13:46] <robertmaxrees> since you're already using it elsewhere.
[16:14:03] <robertmaxrees> hint: you've already used a jquery selector three times in there, like $('ul')
[16:16:15] <tgr225> hmm
[16:16:43] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty self-explanatory.
[16:16:54] <tgr225> first day with jquery :\
[16:16:56] <robertmaxrees> if you'd use $('ul') to select a <ul>, how would you select an input?
[16:17:27] <robertmaxrees> it's not a trick question :)
[16:17:40] <tgr225> with 'input'?
[16:17:47] <robertmaxrees> boom
[16:18:06] <robertmaxrees> and to get the value of an input, you can use .val() on it.
[16:18:31] <robertmaxrees> you use .val() kind of like you use .append() or .click(), except you don't put anything in it.  $('input').val();
[16:20:56] <tgr225> still lost
[16:21:18] <robertmaxrees> so you're going to get the text of the input with $('input').val(), right?
[16:21:25] <tgr225> correct
[16:21:31] <robertmaxrees> now you need to do something with it.
[16:21:35] <tgr225> I don't see how that links back to the input button
[16:21:36] <tgr225> right
[16:21:54] <robertmaxrees> *input text, not button.
[16:22:02] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with string concatenation?
[16:22:14] <robertmaxrees> like, adding two strings to get a third one?
[16:22:59] <robertmaxrees> because we'll need to use that to put the text in the <li> tags.
[16:23:20] <tgr225> not really
[16:25:11] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you can add string in js to get new ones, like 'foo' + 'bar' will give you 'foobar'
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> you can also do that with things that give you strings, like 'foo' + $('input').val();
[16:28:56] <tgr225> alright
[16:28:59] <tgr225> so
[16:29:33] <tgr225> 'name' + $('input').val();
[16:31:26] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:35:54] <tgr225> still not getting the input
[16:36:20] <robertmaxrees> right, so where would you put that text?
[16:36:27] <tgr225> html
[16:36:31] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:36:33] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[16:37:56] <tgr225> http://jsbin.com/dukeje/5/edit
[16:38:27] <robertmaxrees> where's you get $('name') from?
[16:38:41] <robertmaxrees> $('input').val(); refers to the <input>
[16:39:56] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to select it a second time.
[16:40:13] <tgr225> how do you print then
[16:40:24] <robertmaxrees> that'll be apart of the append.
[16:40:32] <robertmaxrees> something like $('ul').append('<li>' + $('input').val() + '</li>');
[16:41:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to follow a tutorial or something?
[16:41:34] <tgr225> was trying to
[16:41:46] <robertmaxrees> it should have covered some of these basics.
[16:47:25] <sammych> *wonders if this is the right channel for this - someone can suggest a better one* CSS print styles - I'm looking for something that'll let me put in extra content when an element is repeated on a new page due it being page-break-en
[16:47:25] <Hailwood> Hey guys, if I have $('...').on('touchstart click', someFunc); then in cases like using the google chrome device emulation someFunc gets called twice as it triggers the touchstart and the click event - is there any way to stop this behaviour?
[16:47:48] <robertmaxrees> sammych check #css
[16:48:32] <robertmaxrees> Hailwood try just "click" maybe?
[16:49:49] <robertmaxrees> sammych fwiw you're not really going to have much luck with that.
[16:49:58] <robertmaxrees> afaik at least.
[17:24:06] <sammych> robertmaxrees: sorry, I dashed off to #css before I could say thanks
[17:24:12] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[17:24:17] <sammych> thanks.
[17:24:38] <sammych> had a not so warm welcome. But yeah, don't think there's anything out there
[17:24:50] <robertmaxrees> print styles are kind of a PITA.
[17:25:42] <sammych> there really isn't much to it, and I kinda understand how it works
[17:26:26] <robertmaxrees> you wanted that "cont." thing when content filowed to the next page?
[17:26:57] <sammych> maybe I'm living in a fairytale land where html printing is as configurable as other solutions like sharepoint doc generation
[17:27:06] <robertmaxrees> heh, not in the slightest.
[17:27:10] <robertmaxrees> you can't control the printer.
[17:27:57] <sammych> THEADs get autorepeated on the next page when the table overflows the page
[17:28:12] <sammych> the printer is wkhtmltopdf
[17:28:54] <sammych> it's good enough, but I'm trying to see how complex a document I can generate with it
[17:29:54] <robertmaxrees> you could probably do quite a bit, but it'd take a lot of playing around and configuring to get waht you want.
[17:34:08] <sammych> I'd like to have something that says 'if this element is "less than X points high, don't break inside - this would stop a section with 2 lines being broken into two pages
[17:34:30] <sammych> but I realise I can do this with some generation-time JS
[18:29:55] <_Sanji> Been strugling a while with this problem.... basically im trying to implement a bootstrap-datepicker for a form in a bootstrap-modal (it refreshes using ajax indicating if there was an error in the form or not). But after the first try (when the form reloads after being submitted), the datepicker stops working. And each time i refresh the modal-form a new div class datepicker appears below the first one... so basically on 4 reloads, 
[18:30:37] <_Sanji> how can i fix this behaviour?
[18:39:07] <Pattrico> quick q
[18:39:25] <Pattrico> how do i make another link make a dropdown menu appear
[20:17:23] <SuperPhly> I'm getting this error: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function on line 115 of scripts.js on http://jeanjones.com
[20:17:40] <SuperPhly> Does that have anything to do with no conflict mode?
[20:21:16] <dismist> is jquery being loaded in your html before scripts.js?
[20:21:34] <SuperPhly> yeah, no problem there... it is in no conflict mode
[20:21:44] <dismist> try flipping the order anyway
[20:21:47] <dismist> jquery first
[20:22:09] <dismist> its tripping over the $ right?
[20:22:27] <SuperPhly> i think
[20:22:30] <dismist> you can try changing all your $('') selectors to jQuery('')
[20:23:36] <mayank> dismist: where can i find the irc logs?
[20:23:46] <dismist> what of
[20:24:22] <mayank> dismist: old logs of this irc channel?
[20:24:39] <dismist> hell if i know? why you asking me?
[20:24:52] <mayank> sorry.
[20:25:37] <mayank> who is the admin of this channel?
[20:32:37] <SuperPhly> folks with an @ sign next to their name
[20:32:45] <SuperPhly> or, no body it seems
