[00:05:40] <Ruku5> Hi Guy, trying to figure out where I'm going wrong, I have an image inside a div with two other div, one top, one bottom and when the image is faded in the top caption seems to fade in reverse? http://jsfiddle.net/TG9WL/
[00:06:15] <Ruku5> I'm using FF 16.0.2 on XP SP3
[00:11:20] <Ruku5> Any thoughts guys on why my top caption is reverse fading when all I do is fade in the image? http://jsfiddle.net/TG9WL/
[00:14:32] <Ruku5> Anyone at all avalible to offer a little help or feedback?
[00:19:21] <someprimetime> sup
[00:21:12] <Ruku5>  hey primetime, you able to help with something?
[00:32:16] <aqeel> hi room
[00:36:23] <aqeel> any examples for simple loding dialog while contents load via ajax
[00:41:17] <Ruku5> something like $('#id').text('Loading...').load(page.php); would be the ultra plain and simple, you want a dialog box pop though?
[00:44:00] <aqeel> well content loads in the background and stops the dialog when loading is done
[00:44:16] <aqeel> http://malsup.com/jquery/block/#overview
[00:44:23] <aqeel> how is this any tied out
[00:45:03] <aqeel> tried*
[00:52:30] <someprimetime> man yeoman is so DOPE
[00:52:34] <someprimetime> unF
[00:53:00] <someprimetime> now i have to convince my co-workers to start using it :|
[00:54:43] <aqeel> ??
[01:14:22] <someprimetime> aqeel: why don't you create your own?
[01:14:27] <someprimetime> with css
[01:15:36] <aqeel> wel i want to ..
[01:15:39] <someprimetime> if you use the native alert it'll halt execution but if you need to give the user some sort of dialogue window i'd recommend making a div popup (show/hide an absolutely [or fixed] positioned div)
[01:15:57] <aqeel> http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/
[01:16:04] <aqeel> how is this...
[01:16:37] <someprimetime> i'd pass a callback into your method that loads the content $('#whatever').load(function() { //remove dialog});
[01:17:00] <aqeel> i have customized the alert and i want to now have the loading spinner after the user clicks ok abd the content loads behind the spinner or similar
[01:18:32] <someprimetime> that spin.js is cool
[01:18:36] <someprimetime> i hate having to make those
[01:20:11] <someprimetime> so when they click ok $('#ok-btn').click(function() { // var spinner = new Spinner().spin(); $('body').append(spinner.el); }); is how i'd do it i guess by looking @ that spin site
[01:20:31] <aqeel> i think so too
[01:21:03] <aqeel> i am sercing net if any more or something interesting is out there
[01:21:42] <someprimetime> alright well i'm gonna play some l4d2
[01:22:10] <aqeel> thanks for xonversation
[01:22:17] <aqeel> conversation*
[01:23:12] <someprimetime> thanks for the spin.js link i'll be using that
[01:25:51] <aqeel> u r welcme
[01:26:04] <aqeel> i just stumble upon myself just now
[01:27:21] <nights`> hi
[01:27:35] <aqeel> hi
[01:27:51] <nights`> is there a way to exclude 'this' from a selector?
[01:27:58] <nights`> like a boolean operation
[01:28:50] <nights`> $('.cssclass and !this').
[01:29:34] <aqeel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/437958/jquery-exclude-this-from-selector
[01:30:56] <aqeel> nights u got it
[01:30:59] <nights`> that doesnt work :(
[01:31:02] <nights`> i tried that earlier
[01:31:15] <nights`> still get all of that class
[01:31:15] <aqeel> what is your case...jsfiddle
[01:31:41] <aqeel> may be you are not doing something the right way
[01:34:29] <someprimetime> nights`: what are you trying to do exactly?
[01:34:40] <someprimetime> use case?
[01:35:13] <nights`> problem is i need to put something like
[01:35:13] <nights`> $(this).find('.calender_event_dropdown')
[01:35:19] <nights`> in that not() selector
[01:35:30] <nights`> which probably isnt valid
[01:35:50] <someprimetime> what not selector?
[01:36:12] <nights`> $(".content a").not(this).hide("slow");
[01:36:13] <someprimetime> i need some kind of demo to see what you are trying to do
[01:36:19] <someprimetime> $(
[01:36:21] <someprimetime> woops
[01:36:43] <someprimetime> $('.class').is($(this)) && $(this).hide('slow'); ?
[01:37:27] <someprimetime> or $(this).is('.class') && $(this).hide('slow');
[01:38:26] <someprimetime> damn require js is not bad. should have been using it before
[01:40:25] <aqeel> someprimetime you did not play your 14d2
[01:40:39] <someprimetime> aqeel: hah i was just loading steam and it crashed :(
[01:41:13] <aqeel> <someprimetime> alright well i'm gonna play some l4d2
[01:41:24] <aqeel> why....
[01:41:37] <aqeel> what causes the crash
[01:42:04] <someprimetime> steam is the program that i log in to so i can play with my friends (also made by valve who make the game)
[01:42:20] <someprimetime> not sure. probably because it's just buggy for mac
[01:42:33] <aqeel> could be
[01:42:40] <someprimetime> they keep adding stuff and breaking things
[01:42:40] <aqeel> are you in vm or anything
[01:42:44] <someprimetime> nope
[01:42:45] <nights`> someprimetime: i basically do a class.slideUp (including this) and right after that i do this.slideDown    problem is next time i call the same function (on hover)  this gets slided up first and then down again, basically dont want it to get the slideUp
[01:42:53] <nights`> hope that wasnt too confusing :S
[01:43:12] <someprimetime> nights`: sounds like it's getting bound multiple times?
[01:43:55] <aqeel> you are running the flow that is causing this
[01:44:27] <aqeel> for slide down the slide up then hover goes through slide up and slide down exactly
[01:44:31] <someprimetime> $('#btn').click(function() { $('.toShow').is(':visible') ? $('.toShow').hide() : $('.toShow').show(); }); you could maybe do something like that
[01:44:44] <someprimetime> or set a data attribute on it/add a class and check for the presence of it
[01:46:12] <aqeel> why are you giving slide up then slide down then hover.....just use hover ......when up do something else when down do nothing
[01:46:33] <nights`> someprimetime: ah, maybe that will work
[01:46:34] <nights`> one sec
[01:46:47] <nights`> hmm
[01:46:53] <nights`> because its a long list of items
[01:47:04] <nights`> basically have this
[01:47:05] <nights`> $('#event_list').on('mouseenter', '.event_entry', function(e)
[01:47:25] <aqeel> if you can jsfiddle we might reduce your confusion is logical coding
[01:47:54] <nights`> ok, if i cant solve it in a few more minutes i will create a jsfiddle
[01:48:04] <nights`> but its not that complicated probably
[01:48:30] <aqeel> sometimes it is the logic that gets the nerve of the problem
[01:49:24] <aqeel> where as coding is exactly fine and have nothing wrong in it...but the position of the blocks of code does give headaches
[02:02:51] <aqeel> someprimetime ....if i am using jquery and want to use spin.js, is it better off i use the jquery plugin with it or can simply use spin.js alongside with jquery and have no conflicts....what are your thoughts
[02:03:20] <someprimetime> i'd use it as a standalone there shouldn't be any conflicts
[02:03:54] <aqeel> thanks...going to give a try
[03:44:46] <BastianB> Hello, is there a way to override the z-index of the background div when using $elem.dialog() method?
[03:52:23] <BastianB> or is it possible to disable ui-widget-overlay, on dialog box?
[03:52:35] <mdedetrich> does anyone know if there is an easy way
[03:52:42] <mdedetrich> to diagnose sudden jumps in jquery animations
[03:53:05] <mdedetrich> I have a jquery animations which staggers lightly on first execution, but it runs fine after every other execution
[03:53:14] <mdedetrich> obviously something is being cached, just have no idea what
[04:02:21] <mdedetrich> nvm fixed it
[05:32:24] <Stormryder> hi there
[06:08:12] <greenapplezrule>  hi
[06:09:06] <xec> hello greenapplezrule
[06:09:17] <xec> how are you doing today
[06:09:53] <greenapplezrule>  doing good, just bored lol decid
[06:10:03] <harami> hello, i have a site here if you click on view map, and then click on proceed to stage2, it is supposed to show stage 2 which is down there, i am using jquery to display it but its not functioning, http://rdbs.websiterocks.com/
[06:10:19] <greenapplezrule>  deciding which project to work o
[06:10:40] <greenapplezrule>  on next
[06:12:03] <xec> harami: what part of the code is supposed to do that? line 51 of the html file?
[06:13:28] <harami> xec: umm 47 in mine
[06:13:40] <harami> --> jQuery(".stage-1to2").click(function () {
[06:15:16] <greenapplezrule>  weird was truncating everything I said
[06:16:42] <xec> harami: do you see the errors in the console?
[06:17:30] <xec> harami: you're missing the }); after each of your click handlers (you only have the one ending the doc ready)
[06:17:35] <harami> nopes xec
[06:17:39] <harami> hmm ok
[06:17:52] <xec> harami: do you know what the console is? what browser are you using?
[06:18:01] <harami> yes i know
[06:18:04] <harami> firefox
[06:18:08] <harami> but i didn't see it there wierd
[06:18:33] <xec> ok, if you have the firebug console open and refresh you should get three errors telling you you're missing a }
[06:20:04] <xec> greenapplezrule: your client seems to be quitting a lot, maybe try another?
[06:20:46] <tigger> hi
[06:21:09] <sukima> I needed a little jQuery help. How do you walk a portion of the DOM converting the text in it but keep the nodes intact? I have this as a starting example: http://jsfiddle.net/sukima/9wF7N/
[06:21:15] <tigger> can somebody point to a tutorial on how to use e.g. ui-widget-content
[06:21:16] <tigger> ?
[06:22:16] <greenapplezrule>  im writing a client, sorry if the connects and disconnects are flooding the room, ill use another, i just picked a channel i come to a lot as i knew there was generally a lot of activity here
[06:22:20] <sukima> I dont know ui-widget-content
[06:22:39] <tigger> it is part of the css-framework of jquery
[06:22:53] * sukima shrugs
[06:22:53] <b-ot> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[06:23:05] <xec> lol
[06:23:32] <dblosevn> ?
[06:23:42] <tigger> I have found some explanation here: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137970/jQuery%20UI%20CSS%20Framework . But I need something more, well, for beginners.
[06:24:09] <xec> tigger: it's just a css class
[06:24:32] <tigger> I know that, but are there more detailed guidelines
[06:24:36] <tigger> on how to use these classes
[06:24:37] <tigger> ?
[06:24:40] <xec> what are you trying to do
[06:24:55] <sukima> manually working with the widget CSS is a bit advanced
[06:25:01] <tigger> I want to apply the ui-lightness to my site
[06:25:13] <tigger> and was wondering what to do to apply it on everything
[06:25:15] <tigger> or on the whole site
[06:25:23] <tigger> Maybe I have got a wrong idea about it all
[06:25:51] <tigger> Does it suffice to give the body-tag a specific class?
[06:26:16] <tigger> Up until now I have only given the div tag containing my resizable this ui-widget-content class
[06:27:28] <sukima> the CSS in jquery-ui works with jQuery-ui. As you use jQuery-ui to make widgets and such it adds classes to the markup so the CSS maes it look good. I don't think it was designed to manually markup your own content (though it could in theory) maybe jquery-mobile would be more you tastes for that
[06:28:45] <sukima> You can cut and paste css rules and apply them to your own markup. But your still going to have to manually design the site.
[06:29:30] <tigger> So it is more a switch I have to flick in javascript to theme my site?
[06:30:03] <tigger> because I have downloaded and <link>ed the ui-lightness theme, but it is not applied to the widgets I made
[06:30:23] <tigger> like resizable and slider
[06:30:51] <sukima> That;s like trying to drive a new car by climing into the engine compartment.
[06:31:03] <xec> sukima: the best method is probably to convert the content of each textNode - unfortunately jquery isn't great at textnodes. maybe have a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/298750/how-do-i-select-text-nodes-with-jquery
[06:31:46] <sukima> xec: Thanks I'll start experimenting. I suspected there wasn't an easy way.
[06:34:46] <sukima> xec maybe I could take the entire content with html() and then with a regex rot13 only the text inside < > and then rot13 the whole thing.
[06:35:30] <xec> sukima: http://jsfiddle.net/9wF7N/5/
[06:35:48] <xec> this converts the original, but you could just do the same operation on a clone
[06:37:04] <xec> or just copy the html
[06:37:15] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/9wF7N/6/
[06:37:23] <sukima> Wow!
[06:38:27] <zuloyd> hi
[06:38:34] <xec> .forEach() on arrays isn't supported in ie8 though, if you need to support ie8 and older you could just do $.each(arr, func) instead
[06:38:42] <sukima> xec thans you gave me alot to think about
[06:38:47] <zuloyd> I have the weirdest problem with a jquery-based tool I programmed. In internet explorer 9, it sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't
[06:38:54] <zuloyd> http://www.solar-aspekt.de/calc here it is
[06:39:37] <zuloyd> in firefox and chrome it works, one can see how it should work
[06:39:50] <zuloyd> but when I start the IE9, the map of Germany is above the intro image
[06:40:10] <zuloyd> when I use the developer tools then and switch to IE8 document mode and then back to IE9 document mode, it works as in Firefox
[06:40:23] <xec> zuloyd: remove the calls to console.log()
[06:40:35] <xec> zuloyd: IE chokes when the console isn't open
[06:40:41] <zuloyd> okay xec
[06:41:09] <zuloyd> I would never have found this out, but it sounds reasonable, because with an open console it works
[06:41:19] <zuloyd> if that solves it, THANK YOU!!!
[06:41:23] <xec> yeah it's pretty stupid
[06:41:51] <danmichel> Befrore I LazyLoaded my slider, it had a slide effect, now the images just sort of show up, but once all three images have been shown, it has a 'fadein' effect. Thanks in advance for any help http://varmag.com/
[06:42:22] <xec> zuloyd: you can also do something like: console = console || { log: function(){} };
[06:42:54] <zuloyd> it works... I don't know how to thank you. I despaired on this four hours :D
[06:43:12] <gnarf> xec: console = window.console ||
[06:43:16] <gnarf> xec: :)
[06:43:18] <xec> yeah, that
[06:43:20] <gnarf> anyway - SLEEP!
[06:43:21] <xec> gnarf++
[06:43:35] <jamietech> danmichel: why would you lazyload if it's at the top of the page
[06:43:41] <gnarf> time over in korea is fed up :)
[06:45:28] <danmichel> jamietech because its speeds up my site by almost a second and a half, and before i lazy loaded it, the slider would sort of load funny, where you could see the other two images bellow the first one for a slit second. all three images would load at the same time
[06:46:00] <xec> korea? how exotic!
[06:46:38] <xec> are they tired of gangnam style yet? :P
[06:47:50] <danmichel> it would be about 4 seconds before the lazy load jamietech http://www.webpagetest.org/result/121110_8E_82a798ec8fe1e7ec27f945d27819904f/
[06:54:47] <danmichel> jamietech i removed lazy load from my test site so you can see the effect http://theplural.com/
[06:56:18] <guy> Does jQuery cache selectors when they are used once? eg. is there any difference between for(var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) $(document) and var doc = $(document); for(var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) doc
[06:56:45] <xec> guy: no and yes.
[06:56:57] <xec> in that order
[06:57:33] <guy> well, if it doesn't cache them, then there surely is overhead to construct $(document) object
[06:57:57] <xec> your logic is sound
[06:58:49] * guy too lazy too look at the jQuery source code.
[06:59:40] <xec> this has little to do with the jquery source. you're asking if referncing a variable is quicker than calling a function over and over
[06:59:44] <xec> referencing*
[07:01:38] <guy> not exactly. I am not worried about the overhead of simply calling a function. if there is memoizing (cache) in place, then the overhead is so tiny that I wouldn't give a damn. Though, I have no idea what jQuery does every time when $ is called.
[07:03:30] <shoky> if you pass in a DOM node, hardly anything happens inside, there's nothing to cache anyway
[07:03:34] <xec> well, when you're supplying a selector string it's going to query the dom, but when you're supplying document it's just going to return a jquery object containing that
[07:03:55] <guy> roger.
[07:04:27] <shoky> to be specific: if ( selector.nodeType ) { this.context = this[0] = selector; this.length = 1; return this; }
[07:06:16] <guy> I need to build a custom scrollbar. All is well, except: when you drag the handler, drag it outside of the content, way to the bottom, it starts selecting the text below the scrollable area.
[07:06:17] <guy> https://dev.anuary.com/680a3c94-9651-550f-abca-e853613eb9ce/
[07:06:43] <guy> Is there a way to temporary disable content selection?
[07:07:10] <guy> I know how to do it with CSS. Though, I wonder if there is JavaScript approach.
[07:07:29] <ruby_on_tails> why not use css
[07:07:34] <ruby_on_tails> if it works fine
[07:07:39] <ruby_on_tails> though you can apply the css using js
[07:08:20] <guy> yeah, that's what I just thought about (stupid!) will apply the CSS while dragging to the document and remove it immediately after the event.
[07:09:07] <ruby_on_tails> can do that
[07:09:12] <ruby_on_tails> nothing is stupid if it works
[07:09:19] <guy> I always forget. Does jquery handle the browser extensions? ie. is css('user-select', 'none')
[07:09:41] <guy> enough or do I need -o-user-select, etc.
[07:11:13] <fr4nk> hi!
[07:11:42] <fr4nk> we have a ui-dialog with a lot of text-input fields
[07:12:44] <fr4nk> now we sometimes have a very slow change from one input to another with the tab-key
[07:12:55] <fr4nk> with mouse click everything is ok
[07:13:13] <fr4nk> does has anybody an idea?? :-/
[07:30:53] <aqeel> ok guys how do i find out for content being to start load and when it finishing load from external link via .load()
[07:47:26] <codechewing> aqeel: you need to pass a second argument to load()
[07:47:58] <codechewing> aqeel: like so; http://jsfiddle.net/gAPsW/
[07:55:34] <harami> not sure if this is a wordpress or jquery question, but how can i use the post id in the jquery selector?
[07:56:40] <MattBrotz> Harami, do you have an example or code you explain a liitle more, are you asking how you can send the post id to a function in jquery?
[07:57:35] <harami> yes Matt
[07:57:43] <harami> i want to send the post id to a jquery function
[07:58:08] <MattBrotz> using worpress?, your own function?
[07:58:15] <harami> basically i want to hide all the posts, and create a link for that, if you click on the title, the post will display
[07:58:26] <harami> using wordpress or my function
[07:58:34] <harami> usually i do custom functions
[07:59:01] <MattBrotz> oh ok 1 second, I create a simple example
[07:59:03] <bnb_dev> I have created a button dynamically using before() method, but when its click not working, I used live and on methods but fail
[07:59:20] <harami> i can send you the current function if you want
[07:59:43] <MattBrotz> or I will just tell you, find the  class of the posts
[08:00:08] <MattBrotz> and do $(".THAT CLASS").hide()
[08:01:24] <harami> hmm ok
[08:01:43] <MattBrotz> then find the class of the title, and use onclick= in the html and get the php code for the id, put it in there
[08:01:45] <danmichel> Before I LazyLoaded my slider, it had a slide effect, now the images just sort of show up, but once all three images have been shown, it has a 'fadein' effect. Thanks in advance for any help http://varmag.com/
[08:02:09] <bnb_dev> click event not works on dynamically created element?
[08:02:34] <MattBrotz> I'm not fully sure how do it with wordpress
[08:02:46] <aqeel> use on() for dynamically created elements...common issue
[08:03:33] <aqeel> in accessing use body for top bubbling...and going down from there
[08:04:18] <bnb_dev> aqeel: I used but it did not work, I used before() method to create the dynamic button
[08:04:39] <aqeel> it may be the way you r using on() is incorrect
[08:04:42] <aqeel> any fiddle
[08:04:45] <codechewing> bnb_dev: share the code on jsfiddle
[08:05:09] <aqeel> i am using it and works like a charm
[08:05:19] <aqeel> on many occasions
[08:05:44] <MattBrotz> Harami is this like something you want? http://jsfiddle.net/YASFt/
[08:06:16] <aqeel> <codechewing> can u help me in more depth...jailbreak.webege.com then click the explosion
[08:06:47] <aqeel> after clicking ok it should show the loading and when loading is finished hides the spinner
[08:07:07] <aqeel> wait let me load it up first
[08:09:29] <aqeel> yup can try it out now
[08:10:08] <MattBrotz> hey harami check this out http://jsfiddle.net/YASFt/1/ , this similar to what you want?
[08:10:28] <aqeel> bnb_dev u clear your problem
[08:11:39] <bnb_dev> aqeel: oops! I did mistake in syntax, it's solved now.
[08:11:57] <aqeel> good to hear that
[08:12:24] <aqeel> on() is a huge success for dynamic content help
[08:12:56] <codechewing> aqeel
[08:13:03] <aqeel> yes
[08:13:06] <codechewing> can't clicked on the explosion
[08:13:09] <bnb_dev> is live () deprecated now ?
[08:13:10] <codechewing> click
[08:13:20] <aqeel> try again
[08:13:47] <codechewing> the alert box is in the way, when I click ok, blank screen
[08:14:30] <codechewing> bnb_dev: live() goes through on() in more recent jQuery versions, so you may as well use on() anyway
[08:14:59] <aqeel> what is your resolution and which browser are you using
[08:15:00] <bnb_dev> OK
[08:15:01] <bnb_dev> thankks
[08:15:40] <aqeel> 1024x768 minimum and sometime ie flase this and use firefox in that case
[08:16:28] <aqeel> opera and chrome i have syoped at moment as they have huge cache problem with latest browsers even explained on their faq
[08:16:37] <aqeel> stopped*
[08:16:52] <codechewing> aqeel: woah. lots of third party loading going on
[08:17:05] <MattBrotz> How can I find out what "this" is?
[08:17:26] <aqeel> those are respective sites for the mentioned topics
[08:18:24] <aqeel> i will work more for clicking or hovering showing the whole site and one can see what is going on as of latest stuff in one place
[08:19:31] <aqeel> i need to make a connection between when ok is clicked and spinner starts and finishes as content gets loaded
[08:19:35] <MattBrotz> Could someone help me?
[08:20:03] <aqeel> use this.alert('i was this'); something like that
[08:20:21] <MattBrotz> oh ok
[08:24:32] <codechewing> aqeel: can you not just do $( window ).load( function() { // remove spinner });
[08:26:23] <aqeel> well i am at this point but i need to make few more connections first after clicking the ok must the spinner come in view as of right now it is hidden behind the alert and then after the content finishes loading i do what you have suggested...
[08:37:48] <dns-away> helloj
[08:37:54] <dns-away> :)
[08:38:25] <dns-away> where is the cpammers
[08:39:07] <dns-away> can be in
[08:45:33] <aqeel> ok guys this spinner is not mine and now how exactly i get it to stop....
[08:45:54] <aqeel> http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/
[08:46:15] <aqeel> if i use spinner.stop(); it is not working
[08:46:29] <beachandbytes> lets see your code
[08:46:36] <beachandbytes> the method .stop() is correct
[08:47:37] <aqeel> $( window ).load( function() { spinner.stop(); });
[08:48:12] <aqeel> but i do have this too.....for on spinning
[08:48:14] <aqeel> var target = document.getElementById('loadspinner');
[08:48:34] <aqeel> var spinner = new Spinner(opts).spin(target);
[08:48:46] <dns-away> fucking
[08:48:48] <dns-away> code
[08:49:08] <andrunix> Jquery works fine in my rails app but jquery-ui doesn't. I am also using bootstrap. I get 'Object has no method "datepicker"' error.
[08:49:29] <andrunix> any ideas what might be wrong. Jquery-ui works fine in another rails project w/o bootstrap.
[08:49:44] <andrunix> therefore I am thinking there is a conflict between bootstrap and jquery-ui
[08:49:44] <aqeel> might be a conflict issue
[08:50:06] <aqeel> try the noconflict() jquery
[08:50:47] <andrunix> jquery seems to work fine but only jquery-ui has the problem
[08:51:00] <andrunix> particularly, the datepicker
[08:51:11] <aqeel> wrap your jquery ui stuff in noconflict()
[08:51:24] <andrunix> i'll try that. thx
[08:51:28] <beachandbytes> ageel are you calling spinner.stop() before you declare spinner?
[08:51:37] <aqeel> no after
[08:57:30] <aqeel> ok can check out at jailbreak.webege.com
[08:57:45] <aqeel> this line is having no effect
[08:57:59] <aqeel> $( window ).load( function() { spinner.stop(); });
[08:58:46] <aqeel> well i have start the spinner usisng another external function though
[09:02:38] <dns-away> pussty
[09:02:40] <dns-away> stop
[09:02:45] <dns-away> ideiots
[09:10:27] <shal3r> How to detect slow jquery selectors?
[09:17:45] <aqeel> slow jquery selectors???? jquery is robust in itself
[09:17:55] <aqeel> what u exactly need
[09:18:15] <joshmock> shal3r: depending on what browser you're in, using the JS profiler could help
[09:18:39] <joshmock> shal3r: but, be aware that some selectors are going to be slower/faster depending on what browser you're using
[09:19:11] <shal3r> joshfinnie, at least chrome profiler can't give anything useful with jquery
[09:19:25] <aqeel> chrome is hell like buggy
[09:19:37] <joshmock> shal3r: generally anything that starts with a .classname or #id selector is performant because jQuery can fall back on the browser's getElementById or getElementsByClassName
[09:19:46] <aqeel> i stopped for time being testing for opera and chrome
[09:36:31] <Marnix_IxD> Am I doing something wrong or is it impossible to insert PHP into .html()?
[09:38:39] <Marnix_IxD> is there another method to do DOM insertions that can handle PHP?
[09:39:02] <codechewing> Marnix_IxD: you can't parse php inside your JS
[09:39:48] <Ruku5> not that I know of, I'm pretty sure its not possible, you would have to .load() a static php page to trigger php
[09:40:06] <Marnix_IxD> okay
[09:40:07] <codechewing> Marnix_IxD: make an ajax request to a PHP script which returns the data you need, which you then put into your html() method
[09:41:00] <aqeel> ok guys can you close the first loaded window by javascript
[09:41:20] <aqeel> juat out of the ordinary for the sake of conversation only
[09:41:30] <aqeel> just*
[09:41:54] <Ruku5> that  was weird, someones swear script thought I said something wrong in my last comment?
[09:41:56] <aqeel> like typing the address into the address bar
[09:43:04] <Ruku5> -sebar-, everytime i talk you msg me via script that im swearing?
[09:44:47] <aqeel> what was that why did iu recieve that message too...ruku5
[09:45:23] <aqeel> is chatting ban???
[09:45:40] <aqeel> [01:45] -sebar- Hey aqeel ! don't say bullshit on #jquery please, thanks
[09:46:18] <Ruku5> yeah thats it
[09:46:27] <Ruku5> lol glad its not just me
[09:46:40] <aqeel> guess this irc having some problem
[09:46:48] <Ruku5> auto swear script fail :)
[09:46:48] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> just trying to understand how to use retrieved api data http://jsfiddle.net/MaxMeents/QwkWL/
[09:48:15] <Ruku5> Trying to work out what im doinig wrong http://jsfiddle.net/TG9WL/ when i fade in the image for some reason by top caption reverse fades? I think it has something to do with the image getting a 1px shift??
[09:52:23] <aqeel> i am seeing a cross in place of image
[09:52:24] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> maybe i can type it out here: how do u use a data object from a ajax request? how do you turn the json data into individual variables?
[09:54:26] <aqeel> ruku5 u there
[09:54:39] <Ruku5> aqeel, a cross? does the image fade in for you and the top caption fade also?
[09:55:37] <aqeel> the cross indeed fades in then fades out but remains visible like behind something
[09:56:10] <aqeel> what are you trying to achieve
[09:57:26] <Ruku5> I just want to fade in the image and in FF 16.0.2 for some reason I see the top caption fade also which is not meant to happen just wondering why
[09:58:29] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> data[0] brings back {, how can I bring back data['attr']?
[09:59:34] <Ruku5> SimpleAjaxQuesti, just trying to get it to work for you now
[10:00:08] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> THANKS!
[10:01:56] <aqeel> ruku5 it is strange ...my firfox shows nothing , no fadein or fadeout
[10:02:29] <Whirl3d> what happened to #jqueryui? There are only 3 people there.
[10:02:34] <Ruku5> aqeel, hmm bummer not even when you run it?
[10:04:04] <aqeel> yup not even when i run it
[10:04:51] <Ruku5> odd, just incase i pasted the wrong link its http://jsfiddle.net/TG9WL/
[10:06:23] <Ruku5> SimpleAjaxQuesti, i thought getting a JSON value would be easy but this is giving me problems too
[10:07:28] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/TG9WL/1/
[10:07:31] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> just got it!
[10:07:37] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> thanks anyways =)
[10:07:51] <aqeel> your link to pic does not show anything thus changing to some known location works
[10:07:55] <Ruku5> all good
[10:08:27] <aqeel> but is like fade in and then fall at the back
[10:10:14] <Ruku5> aqeel, all good, i
[10:10:52] <Ruku5> ...I'll just use a different method and fade the whole wrapper div, that seems to work
[10:11:44] <Ruku5> thx for your input tho
[10:13:01] <aqeel> hey ruku5 i got this problem too....the 1 px stuff u saying is the border.....try img border:0px and zero out all other thing related to img
[10:14:57] <aqeel> u r welcome
[10:15:32] <Ruku5> thx trying that now
[10:17:49] <malibu> Hi there.. I'm a fairly experienced 'hobby' web designer and I'm starting my foray into jquery for a project I am working on.  Is it better to do some basic learning about jquery fundamentals first or is it ok to just dive in and pick the plugins that I need and use them?
[10:19:06] <Ruku5> aqeel, unfortunatly that doesn't seem to help, all good, will try another approch, thx man, cya
[10:19:41] <aqeel> anytime
[10:19:42] <aqeel> bye
[10:19:46] <codechewing> malibu: bit of both if you can.
[10:20:10] <codechewing> as you already have some html/css experience
[10:20:29] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> could someone point me to a document on how to set up a search after pressing return in an input field? can't find it on google
[10:20:34] <aqeel> i would say dive in and learn as you go
[10:20:56] <aqeel> new stuff comes in old goes by as new jquery versions are released
[10:21:03] <malibu> yeah I can hold my own with css/html.. Is there a really good fundamentals document?  I checked a couple out from the jquery page and they are quite sparse
[10:21:22] <aqeel> do not attach yourself to the hard learned code and then no use in using it
[10:21:45] <aqeel> flow with the trewnd
[10:21:50] <aqeel> trend*
[10:22:42] <aqeel> simple google has that search plugin
[10:22:43] <malibu> Ok.. So is the majority use in jQuery with predefined plugins and widgets then
[10:22:44] <codechewing> malibu: maybe this; http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/jquery-for-absolute-beginners-video-series/
[10:22:54] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> found it, nevermind
[10:23:00] <malibu> codechewing: Thanks I will check that out
[10:23:22] <aqeel> upto you...plugins tend to make sites heavier but yes fency unless if you can code on your owna nd reduce file size
[10:24:19] <aqeel> i would rather code myseld then going for plugins
[10:24:34] <malibu> aqeel: Thank you that is exactly the type of insight I was looking for.  Not surprising... a general purpose 'widget' is heavier then one you code to do what you want
[10:25:48] <aqeel> plugins come with more than what you want...
[10:25:57] <aqeel> alot of extras
[10:26:26] <aqeel> jquery ui is indeed one of them....but then it is upto ones choice
[10:28:51] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> http://jsfiddle.net/MaxMeents/QwkWL/1/ - keypress question
[10:29:03] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> ok... sorry
[10:32:32] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/QwkWL/2/
[10:32:35] <aqeel> working
[10:33:40] <aqeel> simple
[10:39:32] <aqeel> <SimpleAjaxQuesti>
[10:39:47] <aqeel> you got it working??
[10:40:17] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> kinda, found a document and reading it to learn how
[10:41:09] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> oh, you were helping me, sorry, didn't notice aqeel
[10:41:41] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> I think I got it, don't worry about it
[10:41:42] <aqeel> the working code is therfe
[10:41:52] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/QwkWL/2/
[10:42:34] <u89> aqeel: nice fix haha
[10:43:11] <aqeel> haha
[10:45:04] <aqeel> $(document).bind("keydown",function(e){if(e.which == 13){alert("key pressed")}});
[10:45:15] <dblosevn> aqeel: I would have just bound a submit handler for the form, being the input is in a form it will fire submit on enter
[10:45:17] <u89> SimpleAjaxQuesti: Your problem is that there isn't a property called event.keycode but it is event.keyCode (note the camel case)
[10:46:06] <aqeel> cannot be much agreed but i just fix his problem only
[10:46:43] <ajpiano> malibu: jqfundamentals.com
[10:47:11] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/fk7aM/1/
[10:47:12] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> thank you, got it working now
[10:47:25] <dblosevn> without keypress
[10:50:34] <aqeel> http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/
[10:50:59] <aqeel> can some one explain or show how to stop() the spinner my code is having no effect
[10:51:23] <aqeel> window.onload=function(){spinner.stop();}
[10:54:33] <dblosevn> aqeel: post an example of your code, most lileky spinner doesnt exist on load
[10:54:57] <dblosevn> or its in a different scope
[10:54:59] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[10:55:03] <aqeel> click the explosion
[10:55:56] <dblosevn> seriously, thats one way to avoid developing cross browser
[10:57:27] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/QSAnJ/
[10:57:55] <malibu> ajpiano: Thanks, I'm watching the videos now.. will look at that too
[10:58:05] <aqeel> i am developing cross browser but at moment chrome and opera are seriously very messy....even opera in their faq have pointed that out
[10:58:38] <dblosevn> aqeel: that site is horrible, i have a dual quad 3.2ghz laptop with 16gb of ram and that site hoses my entire machine
[10:59:18] <dblosevn> and spinner is not defined
[10:59:33] <aqeel> well it loads third party sites into the view screen
[10:59:46] <aqeel> ???
[10:59:48] <aqeel> it is
[11:00:04] <dblosevn> ReferenceError: spinner is not defined
[11:00:04] <dblosevn> [Break On This Error] 	
[11:00:04] <dblosevn> spinner.stop
[11:00:05] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/QSAnJ/
[11:01:01] <dblosevn> aqeel: spinner is scoped to customload()
[11:01:18] <dblosevn> you will not be able to access it within window.load
[11:01:38] <aqeel> yes but the stop is also within the customload
[11:01:46] <dblosevn> no
[11:01:54] <dblosevn> stop is within the window.load scope
[11:02:27] <aqeel> well spinner must stop after the page content loads
[11:02:49] <dblosevn> so scope spinner to window
[11:03:03] <aqeel> so how to rectify this
[11:03:07] <dblosevn> window.spinner =
[11:03:11] <aqeel> any help will be appreciated
[11:03:51] <aqeel> but how to test this against the content loaded within the window
[11:04:26] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> you know how dreamweaver has a window to see what your site looks like? what is that called? trying to find a free alternative with that
[11:04:43] <dblosevn> SimpleAjaxQuesti: liveview?
[11:05:04] <SimpleAjaxQuesti> probably, thanks, I'll try that
[11:05:12] <aqeel> design mode, live code,live view
[11:05:31] <dblosevn> aqeel: try removing var from spinner = and see if it works
[11:07:06] <dblosevn> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/QSAnJ/1/ like that
[11:08:28] <aqeel> tried no effect
[11:13:51] <dblosevn> aqeel: where is spinner.stop at?
[11:15:36] <aqeel> last line in customload()
[11:16:14] <dblosevn> i see it in fiddle but not on your site
[11:17:19] <aqeel> function is called in allrepo.js file
[11:17:44] <aqeel> technical stuff in tech.js followed by usage stuff in allrepo.js files
[11:18:57] <dblosevn> aqeel: try that http://jsfiddle.net/QSAnJ/2/
[11:20:23] <dblosevn> wou were starting your spinner in the complete callback of load
[11:20:26] <dblosevn> *you
[11:21:25] <aqeel> well it works but i want it to stop after the page finishes loading
[11:21:48] <dblosevn> did you try the code i just pasted
[11:22:07] <aqeel> your code stops the moment the spinner loads and the stuff stilss is loading
[11:22:09] <aqeel> yes
[11:22:27] <dblosevn> my code stops once the content is loaded
[11:22:34] <dblosevn> not at domready
[11:23:18] <aqeel> not the content but the spinner call......$("#customload").load("custom.html #loadfullscreen",
[11:23:33] <aqeel> this calls the spinner
[11:24:41] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/qZTgR/
[11:24:46] <dblosevn> try that http://jsfiddle.net/QSAnJ/4/ your confused on what the complete callback is for
[11:24:46] <aqeel> see this the full  picture
[11:25:17] <dblosevn> your not even starting the spinner untill after it has completed that request
[11:26:25] <dblosevn> thats closer but fires once it has got the content from the server but before domready
[11:26:36] <dblosevn> try the last link i gave you
[11:34:28] <aqeel> well none working.....trying all possible means now
[11:34:33] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/8w3jU/37/
[11:34:51] <beachandbytes> thats pretty simple example of functionality
[11:35:46] <beachandbytes> you can also use .spin(false);
[11:36:18] <aqeel> thanks a million...
[11:36:29] <aqeel> now i can test out why mine is not working
[11:36:32] <beachandbytes> to stop spinner
[11:37:05] <dblosevn> the problem isnt stopping the spinner, the real problem is he doesnt have an event to plug into to fire it on domready
[11:37:38] <dblosevn> oviously the complete callback of .load fires as soon as it gets the content from the server
[11:37:44] <dblosevn> not on domready
[11:43:30] <beachandbytes> ahh i didnt look at his code
[11:43:34] <beachandbytes> do you have a fiddle aqeel?
[11:44:25] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/qZTgR/ is his fiddle
[11:44:59] <dblosevn> not a working one however
[11:46:47] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/xCXjV/ any idea why I can't get flotjs to do "1 day intervals"?
[11:48:16] <dblosevn> draginx: looks like all your points are on th same day
[11:48:27] <draginx> dblosevn: its actually suppose ot be only two days :)
[11:55:24] <beachandbytes> draginx use ticksize: [1,'day']]
[11:56:29] <draginx> beachandbytes: tickSize worked thanks :)

[12:30:38] <hye> hi
[12:31:04] <hye> what is a good html control validator plugin for jquery?  or does jquery roll its own?
[12:40:28] <bung> hye: you mean form validator?
[12:40:37] <bung> the first few that show on google are ok
[12:41:34] <hye> ok i think I will go with this:  http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[12:41:39] <hye> since some say it works well with mobile also
[12:41:47] <hye> i won't have to port to a different validator then.
[12:42:28] <Kythlo> hey i am looking for some help. My jquery quite isn't working.  I am trying to have the bridge connect with my submenu frame but i can't seem to have it move to location of main nav selection. it just stays in its static spot.
[12:42:52] <Kythlo> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/119504375/Website/index.html
[12:43:48] <Kythlo> http://pastebin.com/jsZVsqG1 <-- here is my jquery
[12:46:07] <bung> Kythlo: bridge?
[12:46:20] <bung> all i see on that page is a dropdown on the left item
[12:46:27] <bung> what do you want to happen?
[12:46:41] <Kythlo> there is slider image between, the drop and nav<a>
[12:46:47] <Kythlo> its like a block its just a visual effect
[12:47:19] <Kythlo> Hover to the other menus then you will see it easier
[12:47:59] <Kythlo> Basically want that slider to move with the navmenu selections.
[12:49:28] <bung> Kythlo: we're talking about #slider?
[12:49:37] <Kythlo> yes
[12:49:47] <bung> and where in your code does it move slider?
[12:49:59] <Kythlo> http://pastebin.com/jsZVsqG1
[12:50:30] <bung> its just showing it
[12:50:33] <bung> its not positioning it
[12:51:08] <bung> did you mean to put slider inside submenu?
[12:51:11] <Kythlo> wait i thought when i change teh css position values it would make it show where the new positions are
[12:51:33] <Kythlo> nope sliders needs to hover over the submenu so there visual effect its all 1 peiecce
[12:51:42] <bung> i dont see anything called #menu in your source
[12:52:16] <Kythlo> woha wow derp
[12:52:32] <bung> typically youll want to make an example on jsfiddle
[12:52:42] <bung> and normally youll find those kinda mistakes as you create an example
[12:52:54] <Kythlo> okay going to test it
[13:00:36] <Godfath3r> i'm trying to edit the example before the last from this http://jquery.bassistance.de/accordion/demo/ but i cannot force inside divs to size to the content...
[13:00:41] <Godfath3r> can someone help?
[13:01:41] <Godfath3r> i tried to set autoHeight to true but it doesn't do what it is supposed to do
[13:10:35] <Godfath3r> i'm trying to edit the example before the last from this http://jquery.bassistance.de/accordion/demo/ but i cannot force inside divs to size to the content...any ideas?
[13:19:33] <beachandbytes> what do you want to happen when the content is oversized?
[13:27:50] <aaas> is there an equivalent of replaceWith that replaces only the inner contents (and not the div)
[13:31:15] <aaas> ah looks like it's just html()
[13:31:55] <dblosevn> lol or .wrapInner('<div/>').replaceWith if you really wanted to use replacewith
[13:32:45] <aaas> dblosevn I think I'll stick to the simplest ;)
[13:32:50] <dblosevn> lol

[14:19:07] <bung> sunbeam: is that the exact markup ? usually you need something to target
[14:19:19] <bung> $('#menu a').addClass('someClass');
[14:19:48] <sunbeam> no i need the <a> tage with the inner html "Project"
[14:19:57] <sunbeam> tag*
[14:20:25] <bung> ? contains @ sunbeam
[14:20:27] <bot-t> sunbeam, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[14:21:16] <sunbeam> bot-t: ok thanks,but i need to get the element that ONLY contains project
[14:21:19] <bot-t> sunbeam, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[14:21:55] <bung> lol talkin to a bot bro
[14:22:13] <bung> $('#menu a:contains(Project)')
[14:22:24] <bung> thats what i just linked you to
[14:22:45] <bung> might have to put quotes around that, whatever
[14:26:15] <sunbeam> hahah
[14:26:23] <sunbeam> ok
[14:33:58] <joshsmith> how does one listen for a key press on the whole window or document?

[14:36:39] <joshsmith> hmm the problem wasn't that I was binding to the wrong thing after all
[14:36:49] <joshsmith> it's just not recognizing my left/right arrow keys as keypresses
[14:43:34] <joshsmith> ah I needed keydown for that
[14:49:54] <hye> hi
[14:50:01] <hye> can someone look at this:  http://jsfiddle.net/ppytu/
[14:50:02] <BabySuperman> How do I select the last child that is of the class 'decorated-name' -- $(element).parent().children().last('decorated-name') is grabbing the LAST element hrmmm
[14:50:06] <hye> and tell me why my jquery vlaidation is not working?
[14:50:32] <hye> BabySuperman do this:  $(element).parent().children().last('.decorated-name');
[14:50:49] <BabySuperman> with just semicolon?  yeah that's there
[14:50:58] <hye> no the period is missing
[14:50:59] <BabySuperman> oh -- soryr, lol, missed the '.' -- yeagh tried that!
[14:51:00] <BabySuperman> :)
[14:51:01] <hye> in your selector
[14:51:10] <BabySuperman> still grabs the last <a>
[14:52:01] <hye> $(element).parent().children('.decorated-name').last();
[14:52:33] <hye> shoky can you look at this:  http://jsfiddle.net/ppytu/  my validation won't run
[14:52:54] <BabySuperman> there we go!  Tyvm

[14:56:43] <danmichel> Before I LazyLoaded my slider, it had a slide effect, now the images just sort of show up, but once all three images have been shown, it has a 'fadein' effect. Thanks in advance for any help http://varmag.com/
[15:08:11] <hugo_moss> is there no way to prefetch font-face files with javascript/jquery
[15:09:12] <gnarf> So, any people here from Seoul? Just curious, bunch of the team members are here for jQuery Asia
[15:31:40] <garbagecollectio> what is the difference between new keyword and closure
[15:33:25] <xec> are they even related?
[15:33:49] <garbagecollectio> well
[15:33:51] <garbagecollectio> i mena u can achieve same stuff
[15:34:45] <xec> really?
[15:35:34] <danmichel> Before I LazyLoaded my slider, it had a slide effect, now the images just sort of show up, but once all three images have been shown, it has a 'fadein' effect. Thanks in advance for any help http://varmag.com/
[15:40:04] <xec> garbagecollectio: i don't mean to put you down, and i'm not saying you're completely wrong or anything, but i am curious what you mean though.
[15:40:28] <garbagecollectio> i mean u never have to instantiate an object using new
[15:40:37] <garbagecollectio> you can return an object litera
[15:40:39] <garbagecollectio> literal
[15:40:41] <garbagecollectio> from a function
[15:40:54] <garbagecollectio> and even have privae variables within that function as well
[15:41:05] <garbagecollectio> and u can have different instantances of that function as well
[15:41:13] <jedimind> i'll literally instantiate you if you dont stop
[15:41:28] <jedimind> sorry i just wanted to say that, it wasnt a real threat
[15:41:30] <garbagecollectio> dont stop what
[15:41:33] <xec> lol
[15:44:08] <xec> garbagecollectio: using 'new' doesn't mean you don't have a closure
[15:46:28] <garbagecollectio> i know
[15:47:07] <garbagecollectio> but like
[15:48:12] <garbagecollectio>  but say i had private variables
[15:48:17] <garbagecollectio> they can be accessed bu
[15:48:20] <garbagecollectio> by
[15:48:30] <garbagecollectio> returning an object literal from a function
[15:48:55] <garbagecollectio> or
[15:49:20] <garbagecollectio> i could do new keyword on a function and have a public function that gets those variables
[15:51:18] <xec> i'm not sure i follow, do you have some concrete code examples?
[15:52:44] <xec> don't go out of your way though, i'm just learning javascript myself so i'm unlikely to actually be able to answer you properly :)
[15:53:17] <xec> i'm just curious
[15:55:26] <garbagecollectio> shit man
[15:56:02] <xec> calling me a "shit man" was a bit uncalled for, i think
[15:56:38] <mouses> i'm working on a contact page for a personal site. i am inserting links to facebook, youtube, twitter icons as the background image for a <a>... i realize that i shouldnt do this with php or else i'd have to hard code the "style=" into the <a> on the php page... i decided to load the links on the js side. is that a better solution?
[15:57:18] <bung> mouses php is fine? why use style and not class?
[15:57:38] <mouses> hm
[15:59:18] <mouses> i think you have a point
[15:59:21] <xec> i thought plural of mouse was "mice"
[15:59:37] <mouses> my links come from a json file containing all link data
[15:59:57] <mouses> i guess i could hard code the class into the json for each link?
[16:00:09] <bung> whats your json format like
[16:01:20] <bung> maybe you could do some { links : { 'facebook' : 'http://...', ... } } .... PHP: forloop(blah){ <a class="icon-".$blah[key] }
[16:02:14] <mouses> { "link": [ { "description": "youtube channel", "url": "www.youtube.com/foo", "image": "/images/youtube_icon.png"}, {...}, {...} ] }
[16:03:39] <xec> any reason you're not using <img> tags for the images?
[16:03:59] <bung> heh
[16:04:03] <bung> also a good idea
[16:04:15] <mouses> somebody here told me it was best practice to use background-url
[16:04:30] <xec> what on earth is background-url?
[16:04:52] <mouses> background: url()
[16:05:03] <xec> ah, background-image. yes.
[16:05:05] <bung> i guess it depends if youre putting anything in your anchor tag
[16:05:32] <xec> if your image urls are part of the data you're parsing with php, it's probably easier to create both the links and image tags there and be done with it
[16:06:17] <xec> or you'll have to hard code the image urls in the css, or generate a css file too
[16:06:35] <mouses> i'm trying to use best practices and i think i came across something telling me to use background-image as replacement for the text
[16:06:44] <mouses> i dont mind either way
[16:06:47] <bung> what text
[16:06:48] <mouses> i just want to use best practice
[16:07:03] <mouses> the text would be "Youtube Channel" or "Twitter Page" etc
[16:07:21] <xec> put it in the alt="" attribute of the image
[16:07:36] <xec> and you're golden
[16:07:43] <bung> agree
[16:08:19] <mouses> ok thanks, so how would u determine whether to use <img> or background-image?
[16:08:27] <mouses> in general?
[16:08:37] <mouses> thats what i googled and it suggested background-image
[16:09:17] <xec> semantically, you use css for things that are style only - such as purely decorative images
[16:09:31] <xec> for anything that is part of the content, use <img>
[16:09:47] <xec> there are plenty of gray areas though
[16:09:55] <mouses> ok thx
[16:24:05] <garbagecollectio> how to get my view and controller to talk to each other within an instantiated object
[16:31:16] <xec> garbagecollectio: jquery has no concept of "view" and "controller" as far as i know. do you have some live demo/code to look at?
[16:31:33] <garbagecollectio> lol
[16:33:04] <danmichel> Before I LazyLoaded my slider, it had a slide effect, now the images just sort of show up, but once all three images have been shown, it has a 'fadein' effect. Thanks in advance for any help http://varmag.com/
[16:34:16] <garbagecollectio> whAT IS THE DIFFERENCE between using new vs closure
[16:34:20] <garbagecollectio> like
[16:34:28] <garbagecollectio> why would i use new vs using a closure
[16:42:52] <sunbeam> i need to access <a data-id="180">
[16:42:54] <sunbeam> in jquery
[16:42:58] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[16:46:20] <bung> ? selectors @ sunbeam
[16:46:21] <bot-t> sunbeam, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[16:47:26] <sunbeam> ok got it
[16:47:47] <sunbeam> I still don't know how I can access
[16:47:55] <sunbeam> <li><a href="#">Projects</a></li>
[16:48:06] <sunbeam> I mean, I only want to access those links that exactly and only contains
[16:48:10] <sunbeam> "Projects"
[16:54:33] <sunbeam> nvm
[16:54:56] <bung> i already linked you to that
[16:55:03] <bung> use the :contains selector
[16:55:18] <bung> $('a:contains("Projects")');
[17:26:51] <Braedan> hello
[17:27:20] <Braedan> Anyone on here?
[17:27:36] <thujone> yeah
[17:30:21] <zeroquake> heylo ,im generating few reports in my application -- as of weekly reports is the 7 days report from today -- is it possible to detect a week automatically rather than going back 7 days ?
[17:31:22] <thujone> not sure what you mean?
[17:32:08] <thujone> is there a week object built into the js date object or jquery... no
[17:32:43] <zeroquake> ok.today s date is 11/10/2012 -- when i generate weekly report as of now -- my app goes back 7 days and then generates reports from 4/10/2012 to 11/10/2012
[17:33:35] <thujone>  that sounds good
[17:33:37] <zeroquake> what i am trying to achieve is ,again today being 11/10/2012 say today is thursday -- i jus want reports from this monday to thursday
[17:34:09] <thujone> there's no easy way to do that, from my experience
[17:34:21] <thujone> there's probably a jquery plugin that tries to handle these situations
[17:34:36] <zeroquake> how do we handle leap years in such situations?
[17:35:48] <thujone> well i don't think taht is really an issue here
[17:36:22] <thujone> you can get the current day of the week in the javascript date object
[17:36:25] <zeroquake> yah that was one more problem set yah right...
[17:36:46] <thujone> so once you have that, you could scan backwards day by day until you reach monday
[17:36:57] <zeroquake> yes
[17:37:11] <thujone> subtract 24 hours at a time
[17:37:29] <zeroquake> leap years comes in at this point --- for february -- u dont know whether it has 28 or 29 days right ...
[17:37:45] <thujone> i don't think leap year should matter
[17:37:59] <thujone> you should be working with seconds since epic time
[17:38:05] <thujone> so everything is in seconds
[17:38:17] <zeroquake> oh k so instead of using dates
[17:38:31] <zeroquake> using hours right/
[17:38:34] <thujone> once you have the right day of the week, you subtract the number of seconds that gets you to midnight monday
[17:38:50] <thujone> once you have that number of seconds, then you just create a date object
[17:39:07] <thujone> it would be something like var date = new Date(12345667889)
[17:39:35] <thujone> and that will give you access to the proper month and year and day of the month
[17:39:49] <thujone> you won't have to worry about leap year, because the js object will take care of that
[17:40:14] <thujone> whenever you create a date object, js is smart enough to know if it's a leap year or not
[17:40:27] <zeroquake> interesting ....ty :)
[17:40:32] <thujone> and returns the proper mm/dd/yy
[17:40:46] <thujone> np
[17:41:26] <execut3> zeroquake, take a look at moment.js
[17:42:34] <zeroquake> luks goood will forward it over to my teammates. ....
[17:42:59] <zeroquake> thujone -- kinda still trying to understand  -- so leap or no leap -- it wudnt mater ??
[17:43:12] <zeroquake> ty execut3
[17:43:45] <execut3> I'm not sure you actually need it - if you manage to solve your needs without an external library, you're probably better off like that
[17:44:01] <execut3> but if you find yourself repeating a lot of boilerplate that moment can save you, than its probably worth it
[17:44:50] <thujone> i would try to use a good date helper library if possible
[17:45:27] <thujone> you shouldn't have to worry about leap year at all if you work in seconds instead of days
[17:46:02] <thujone> that's why you convert everything to seconds before adding or subtracting any period of time
[17:46:22] <thujone> and when you're done adding or subtracting time, you convert back into a js date
[17:46:55] <thujone> that's the basic idea when working with date ranges
[17:47:01] <zeroquake> ok  ty :)
[18:11:26] <danmichel> Before I LazyLoaded my slider, it had a slide effect, now the images just sort of show up, but once all three images have been shown, it has a 'fadein' effect. Thanks in advance for any help http://varmag.com/
[18:21:21] <Logikos> anyone in here willing to help me with d3.js? i've combined a few features from different onoline examples and i need some help understanding a bit so i can get the next thing to work
[19:22:06] <min|dvir|us> Is it possible to execute code when a particular script element is loaded?
[19:22:53] <min|dvir|us> Alternatively, is it possible to call $.getScript within an iframe?
[19:43:41] <fission6> is there a way with jquery to parse the code in another <script> block?
[19:56:22] <xenome-> is $.get the proper way to call a cgi script to look for a returned value?
[20:00:57] <fission6> what do you mean look for a returned value
[20:03:02] <xenome-> well I need to pass a number to a cgi script, and I'd like to have the script return that number for display
[20:03:13] <xenome-> so I can assume that when I get that number back, the operation has completed
[20:25:56] <garbagecollectio> hello
[20:25:59] <garbagecollectio> anyone here
[20:26:09] <garbagecollectio> how can i delete item from an array
[20:26:16] <garbagecollectio> but also maintain position
[20:26:18] <garbagecollectio> in a good fashion
[20:27:49] <EasyCo> Hey guys, how would you check if a clicked on DOM element is the same element that a jquery plugin/widget was instantiated on? I'm storing the jquery widget instances in an array and I'm grabbing the event.target object of the clicked element but they'll never compare to true since they're 2 different objects albeit they have the same content.
[20:29:43] <EasyCo> garbagecollectio: You can use pop to get rid from the end: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop
[20:30:09] <EasyCo> or you can use splice for precise array surgery: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[20:30:27] <garbagecollectio> right but when i splice it changes the following or previous element positions
[20:31:35] <EasyCo> That's normal behaviour
[20:31:49] <EasyCo> If you want to keep their position, then you can just replace the values with null
[20:32:16] <garbagecollectio> nah thats excess space
[20:32:28] <garbagecollectio> i need to loop through and get their ids somehow
[20:34:11] <EasyCo> Sounds more like your code structure needs changing for you're approaching the wrong way.
[20:34:25] <EasyCo> WIthout seeing code I'm limited to how much I can help
[20:34:40] <deostroll> can i use the jqxhr object to issue ajax calls to different urls...?
[20:34:42] <EasyCo> But perhaps you could try an associative array/object instead
[20:47:02] <garbagecollectio> associative array/object instead..
[20:47:17] <garbagecollectio> i mean id rather not have
[20:47:27] <garbagecollectio> null values in an array
[20:47:40] <garbagecollectio> id rather have some sort of listening system
[20:47:48] <garbagecollectio> i am right now storing objects in the array
[21:03:48] <samueljohn> anyone worked with SimpleModal contact form before?
[21:06:57] <samueljohn> ?
[21:13:00] <code_ph0y_> hey guys how do you remove an event from an element
[21:13:06] <code_ph0y_> i thought it was off ?
[21:13:12] <code_ph0y_> off('click');
[21:13:14] <code_ph0y_> ?
[21:14:25] <tw2113> The off() method removes event handlers that were attached with .on()
[21:16:29] <code_ph0y_> ahh how do you detach every event on an element regardless of how it was made?
[21:42:40] <samueljohn> anyone worked with SimpleModal contact form before?
[22:04:51] <gnarf> One more check, anyone coming to jQuery Asia tomorrow?

[22:22:48] <nights`> hi guys
[22:23:08] <nights`> how can i avoid hovering issues when elements are sliding out?
[22:23:34] <nights`> like although an element was hovered for a while the sliding make it come out of hover
[22:23:36] <nights`> and then its a mess
[22:47:05] <garbagecollectio> how do i remove element from the dom and all its children
[22:47:07] <garbagecollectio> in javascript
[22:47:25] <peterschmidler> I would like to attach an image inside a div before a div <div class="outer">Here<div class="inner"></div></div> How?
[22:49:06] <nights`> how do i go to a element in the same container as 'this' ?
[22:49:24] <nights`> without using $(this).parent().find() ... which i assume is slow
[22:49:26] <shesek> nights`, siblings?
[22:50:03] <nights`> singlings
[22:50:04] <shesek> nights`, if its a sibling of `this`, you can use $(this).siblings(). If it can be anywhere in the DOM inside the parent, your code above seems like the best way to do that.
[22:50:05] <nights`> siblings
[22:50:07] <nights`> just found that
[22:50:09] <nights`> thanks guys
[22:50:11] <nights`> http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[22:50:46] <nights`> hmm
[22:50:48] <nights`> but wait
[22:50:54] <nights`> i want to select another div in the same level
[22:50:58] <nights`> not all other divs
[22:51:04] <nights`> which i think siblings do
[22:51:31] <nights`> ah
[22:51:33] <shesek> nights`, siblings() takes an optional selectors as an argument
[22:51:35] <nights`> i can put a selector
[22:51:36] <nights`> ah
[22:51:37] <shesek> * selector
[22:51:41] <nights`> sorry i didnt read far enough
[22:51:42] <nights`> perfect
[22:51:49] <nights`> thanks shesek
[22:51:53] <shesek> you welcome
[22:52:08] <nights`> it works
[22:52:15] <nights`> jquery is really intuitive
[22:52:16] <nights`> however
[22:52:22] <nights`> i couldnt get  parent().find to work
[22:52:25] <nights`> which should be the same
[22:53:26] <shesek> its not exactly the same - it'll also find children elements of `this` and its siblings
[22:53:34] <shesek> but it should find anything that siblings finds
[22:57:54] <danmichel> Before I LazyLoaded my slider, it had a slide effect, now the images just sort of show up, but once all three images have been shown, it has a 'fadein' effect. Thanks in advance for any help http://varmag.com/
[23:04:54] <javalover> so i'm trying to change my scrollTOP so it reaches bottom of div....
[23:05:12] <javalover> but it's only going like 80%  what's proper way to resize div & then say "scrolltop" is at bottom...
[23:05:28] <peterschmidler> How can I insert something <div class="outer">Here<div class="inner"></div></div> $("something").find(".outer").eq(0).insertBefore(".inner") Does't work. What am I missing?
[23:06:07] <xenome-> does anyone know how JSON data is passed to the script?  Is it via STDIN?
[23:06:15] <xenome-> like POST
[23:09:18] <javalover> nevermind it's working
[23:09:27] <javalover> i had it set to do it on the if condition not the else
[23:09:35] <javalover> so it was working before content exceeded height of div
