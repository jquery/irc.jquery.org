[00:08:48] <wltoriginal> a= new Object({length:0});
[00:20:17] <Pumi> hello
[00:20:48] <Pumi> does anyone know a good lightbox alternative that works good in iPad ?
[00:23:52] <john-dev> Pumi, mediabox (mootools)
[00:26:18] <Pumi> hey john-dev , thanks for your reply. Does it also support touch ?
[00:27:56] <JKarsrud> hmm, anyone know why .height() would give two different values for height in chrome on windows and osx?
[00:30:14] <john-dev> Pumi, you have to find that out yourself ;-)
[00:30:38] <john-dev> JKarsrud, use .css('height') instead
[00:30:56] <Pumi> oh well, yeah. Just thought maybe you tried it :)
[00:31:33] <Pumi> and just a question about the height.. wouldnt that only return something if you already set the height ?
[00:31:47] <JKarsrud> john-dev: they report the same height
[00:31:59] <john-dev> Can you show us your code?
[00:32:48] <kanzie> ok, I've managed to narrow my memory-leak down to $.jsonp()-library and it is leaking quite bad. What can I use instead that supports canceling outgoing calls?
[00:34:03] <mikeh> Good morning. I have a file upload  box that some other javascript does once it's clicked
[00:34:21] <mikeh> Can I use jQuery to emulate it being clicked so I can fire it off from another location
[00:34:39] <john-dev> You mean the box itself or a button?
[00:36:37] <mikeh> The file input.
[00:37:08] <mikeh> I need to emulate a click event on it to call up the file selection box which is handled by some other javascript from there
[00:37:17] <john-dev> Ah
[00:37:36] <john-dev> $('#input_box_id).bind('click',function() {});
[00:37:46] <john-dev> Hm, nope that won't work
[00:37:50] <mikeh> no
[00:37:55] <chee> or a lady
[00:38:11] <john-dev> $('#input_box_id).bind('focus',function() {});
[00:38:13] <john-dev> thats it
[00:40:23] <mikeh> john-dev: Doesn't.
[00:40:50] <pootietang> I'm having a problem activating a specific accordion in jQueryui
[00:40:53] <mikeh> Unless someone knows of a query/js/ajax uploader that'll let me bind the file selection event to my own button
[00:40:54] <john-dev> Show us your code using jsfiddle please
[00:40:57] <pootietang> I want to open a specific accordion from an external page.
[00:41:59] <john-dev> Well, the focus event get's triggered as soon as someone click's into that input, so you can do anything youw ant from there.. at least it's working fine here..
[00:42:06] <mikeh> oh
[00:42:11] <mikeh> we've crossed wires
[00:42:19] <john-dev> maybe yes :-)
[00:42:28] <mikeh> I want to trigger the click event for that box - ie. I want to emulate someone clicking on it
[00:42:32] <mikeh> not catch the event when they do
[00:43:04] <john-dev> so it's not an input field raither than a div?
[00:43:12] <mikeh> it is a file input
[00:43:29] <john-dev> you can use $.('#box-id).trigger('click'
[00:43:37] <john-dev> $('#box-id).trigger('click'
[00:43:39] <mikeh> aha
[00:43:49] <john-dev> Now i understood..
[01:07:55] <zykes> if i have a table with a td that has a button in it and i have a username in another td, how can i fetch the username via the current button ?
[01:08:04] <zykes> $("button.X").parent().... ?
[01:09:36] <Cork> zykes: $('button.X').closest('tr').find('td.username')
[01:10:55] <zykes> Cork: does it have to have a username id ?
[01:11:06] <duckbox> It would be easier.
[01:11:23] <Cork> zykes: its a class
[01:11:36] <Cork> but ya, you need something to identify the containing element
[01:11:53] <duckbox> zykes: data-id="<username>"
[01:12:14] <zykes> is that supported in html4 ?
[01:12:20] <Cork> yes
[01:12:25] <Cork> wouldn't call it id though :)
[01:12:35] <Cork> data-username sounds more correct
[01:12:37] <duckbox> cork: :)
[01:12:58] <zykes> uhm, as in a html attribute inside <td> ?
[01:13:21] <Cork> zykes: that one would prob go on the button or the tr
[01:20:15] <zykes> danke cork
[01:45:52] <dogarrhea2> so i'm trying to figure out how to "install" a plugin
[01:45:54] <dogarrhea2> but the site is down
[01:45:58] <dogarrhea2> how do you do it?
[01:46:03] <dogarrhea2> http://www.jstree.com/documentation
[01:46:10] <dogarrhea2> doesn't really say how to use their plugin
[01:47:39] <graydot> dogarrhea2: https://github.com/vakata/jstree
[01:48:09] <dogarrhea2> looks even less documented/readable
[01:49:05] <JKarsrud> dogarrhea2: https://github.com/vakata/jstree/blob/v.1.0/index.html
[01:49:10] <JKarsrud> that's an example
[01:54:44] <Trisox> how would you guys select something between to classes?
[02:00:43] <dogarrhea2> cool
[02:00:52] <dogarrhea2> i get to see scrolly text
[02:04:24] <astropirate> Trisox: $('.classOne .classTwo')
[02:04:31] <astropirate> if i understood you correctly
[02:04:49] <Trisox> no..
[02:05:55] <nFFF> You want to select all html between two elements?
[02:07:03] <Trisox> yea datapicker ui
[02:07:16] <Trisox> i want to highlight the selection..
[02:07:41] <nFFF> Highlight the selection?
[02:07:45] <nFFF> Maybe something like
[02:08:35] <nFFF> $('firstelement').before('<div class="highlight">'); $('secondelement').after('</div>');
[02:10:07] <Trisox> mmm
[02:10:20] <blackspotwiggins> nFFF, that's not going to work at all
[02:10:55] <nFFF> blackspotwiggins, why?
[02:11:21] <blackspotwiggins> ?tias @ nFFF
[02:11:21] <bot-t> nFFF, Try It And See
[02:11:56] <nFFF> blackspotwiggins, that should wrap the html in the div element with a class called highlight?
[02:12:07] <Trisox> :P
[02:15:05] <Hooloovoork> nFFF: you wanna do something like var saved = $("element_you_want_wrapped"); $("element_you_want_wrapped").remove(); $("<div>", { "class": "highlight" }).html(saved);
[02:15:29] <Hooloovoork> that's probably not the best way of doing it, but it should work
[02:16:05] <nFFF> .wrap()
[02:16:07] <Gozzy> .html(saved.html()); //.html() is not needed?
[02:16:34] <nFFF> He can just .wrap()
[02:16:46] <Hooloovoork> Gozzy: don't think so
[02:16:49] <Hooloovoork> what's wrap?
[02:18:04] <Hooloovoork> hmm yea, that would work too =P
[02:18:28] <nFFF> maybe $('firstelemnt').parent().find('*').each(function(){if($(this).attr('class') { $(this).wrap('<div class="highlight"></div>'); return false } else { $(this).wrap('<div class="highlight"></div>');  } });
[02:18:38] <nFFF> err
[02:18:50] <nFFF> maybe $('firstelemnt').parent().find('*').each(function(){if($(this).attr('class') === 'secondelement) { $(this).wrap('<div class="highlight"></div>'); return false } else { $(this).wrap('<div class="highlight"></div>');  } });
[02:19:33] <nFFF> Maybe don't even need wrap
[02:19:53] <nFFF> just .addClass() instead
[02:24:30] <scratcha> can anyone suggest any methods for profile jQuery performance ?
[02:28:51] <zykes> can i get the current url parameters in a manner with jquery?
[02:29:34] <Gozzy> location.search gives you the parameters
[02:31:03] <zykes> Gozzy: there there isn't like a $(location).param("....") ?
[02:49:47] <niels__> I'm trying to move a div from #column1 to #column2 and then from #column2 to #column3 when clicked. It works fine from the first to the second column, but I can't get it to append to the 3rd column. What am I missing? http://pastebin.com/BEyZ4qy5 :)
[02:50:37] <john-dev> i think you need to use a live binding
[02:51:05] <john-dev> the class will change obviosly, but jquery won't know that since it was different when the dom was ready
[02:51:21] <niels__> john-dev: makes sense :)
[02:51:25] <john-dev> :-)
[02:52:03] <john-dev> btw, don't use .live ;-)
[02:53:10] <niels__> john-dev: lol, why not?
[02:53:21] <john-dev> it's deprecated
[02:53:33] <niels__> john-dev: uhh. what then? :)
[02:53:50] <niels__> .on?
[02:53:56] <john-dev> yepp
[02:54:03] <niels__> great, i'll give it a go. thanks
[02:54:06] <john-dev> yaw
[02:58:25] <ranonx> admin?
[03:09:17] <kul> how to save value of an attribute of any element to use it in future ?
[03:09:57] <kul> I want to save height of an element which will be changed using jquery function but i want to again make it as original height
[03:17:47] <john-dev> kul add it as value to a hidden form or just set a global var
[03:17:53] <john-dev> form=input*
[03:18:18] <kul> hi john-dev
[03:18:23] <kul> Global var ?
[03:18:23] <john-dev> hello
[03:18:32] <john-dev> my_var=height..
[03:18:43] <kul> yup I did same thing but still not working
[03:19:05] <john-dev> you should provide more informations..
[03:19:14] <john-dev> do you try to access it after a page_reload?
[03:20:06] <gabriel9> anyone tried to hack jquery-ui datepicker to open both widget for range on icon click?
[03:20:59] <gabriel9> kul, are you reloading page after you add it to global namespace?
[03:21:34] <kul> nope have made a slideshow which contains a button called view more info. once you click on that button the info related to that pic will be displayed beneath the slider so it add 250px height on the main slider div. but once I click on next I wish to make the div height same as it was when page loaded
[03:22:28] <gabriel9> just ad callback to set height
[03:22:31] <gabriel9> add*
[03:22:41] <gabriel9> on Next click
[03:22:49] <kul> hmm M sorry how to do that ?
[03:23:27] <kul> I dont want to make height -250px if the viewinfo div is not opened
[03:28:05] <JKarsrud> hmm, I thought the IE8 height() = 0 bug was fixed, anyone know what it is that is borking it?
[03:31:06] <hravula> Hey
[03:31:07] <jonkri> why is the click event fired twice when the ready function is in the body element_
[03:31:12] <jonkri> ?
[03:31:55] <hravula> $( '#tabs' ).tabs() doesn't make tabs? anything changed?
[03:36:21] <JKarsrud> jonkri: whut? code plz? :)
[03:38:01] <antdillon> jonkri, What body element are you applying the click event too?
[03:38:35] <JKarsrud> I'm guessing <body> :D
[03:38:55] <homedisk> is there version of the documentation that I can download?
[03:39:27] <homedisk> preferably *.pdf
[03:39:51] <s0u][ight> hi, can the content of an element be expanded with something loaded using ajax ( how do i combine .load() and .append() )?
[03:42:11] <s0u][ight> like, what is wrong with the following: $("div").append(load('test1.txt'));
[03:42:39] <slax> I have a problem in IE versions below 9. And it is not giving me an error or warning, how would I debug this problem?
[03:42:52] <Onkeltem> Hi all. How to turn ON/OFF an input of type checkbox?
[03:43:12] <Onkeltem> what method it has for this? And can I browse such methods from Chrome Dev panel?
[03:43:42] <Onkeltem> (to stop asking stupid questions like the former)
[03:43:47] <antdillon> Onkeltem, you want to disable a checkbox
[03:44:12] <chrismou> Does anyone know how to add a custom function/bit of code onto the end of the chain? In my head I'm thinking $('.a').css().animate().function(){} ... but it seems it doesn't work like that
[03:44:14] <Onkeltem> antdillon: you mean?
[03:44:24] <Onkeltem> antdillon: I want to check it on/off
[03:44:47] <zykes> if i have a webservice how can i send post data using $().ajax() ?
[03:45:24] <Onkeltem> chrismou: you want something to happen after animation is finished?
[03:45:38] <antdillon> Onkeltem, $(.checkbox).attr(' checked','yes')
[03:45:57] <Onkeltem> antdillon: oh, ok. I thought there is a method
[03:46:01] <homedisk> where can I get the documentation for jquery mobile?
[03:46:06] <Onkeltem> antdillon: thank you!
[03:46:09] <chrismou> onkeltem: Yeah, well, in this example. This is more of a general query - the animate bit was a crude example. But yeah, essentially, add a function that runs at the end of the chain
[03:46:31] <Onkeltem> chrismou: its easy... this is JS :)
[03:46:47] <zykes> i've got http://pastebin.com/jQ5espag currently, but in $_POST in php i don't see any vars
[03:47:10] <Onkeltem> chrismou: in case of animate you do: .animate( {stuff}, 200, 'easeInQuint', function { ... } )
[03:47:43] <Onkeltem> chrismou: or just .animate({stuff}, 200, function {...})
[03:47:55] <Onkeltem> chrismou: callback is the only option to make a chain
[03:48:00] <chrismou> onkeltem: Cool, that'd work in this example, but I'm thinking of a scenario where there isn't a callback I can use
[03:48:37] <chrismou> onkeltem: ah-ha, Ok. So not possible the way I'm thinking.
[03:49:08] <Onkeltem> chrismou: if this is your function, then its up to you to add it to arguments list, and finally call it.
[03:51:18] <chrismou> onkeltem: Right. Thanks for the help
[03:54:52] <slax> Could someone tell me why my script works in IE9 but not the versions below? http://cdclifestyle.com/wp-content/themes/cdcLifestyle/test_cal.html Click a date in the calendar and it should open up the full calendar shown below. But it doesn't load any content.
[04:01:59] <ReclusiveCoder> +i
[04:02:27] <ReclusiveCoder> quit
[04:23:13] <jonkri> (off-topic: does anyone know if it's possible to use the addthis client javascript api to add any other button type than a generic share button?)
[04:31:58] <dogarrhea2> http://www.pasteall.org/29115 why does this error?
[04:32:08] <dogarrhea2> i'm using it locally in a folder. opening the html file
[04:32:28] <calvados> is there a way to sort another div listing while another sort gets triggered ? i tried to check manual sorting and triggering sortable action but it seems its not the way for it.
[04:33:14] <petermcandrew> dogarrhea2: Can't help you but www.pastie.org is nicer :)
[04:33:40] <dogarrhea2> pasteall is more conveinent for me.. just in case i need photos
[04:33:55] <Onkeltem> How to restrict elements by index/number? Like: $('myclass').getOnlyFirst(50)
[04:34:00] <petermcandrew> fair enough
[04:34:43] <petermcandrew> dogarrhea2: what's your error?
[04:34:50] <dogarrhea2> jQuery is undefined
[04:34:53] <johanhar> Do I need a plugin to make a <span> fade in and out?
[04:35:23] <johanhar> Nvm... :)
[04:36:53] <dogarrhea2> what does jQuery is undefined mean...
[04:37:10] <dogarrhea2> i thought adding jquery to my scripts make it defined..
[04:37:11] <duckbox> Dogarrhea2: I don't think you have jQuery linked into your file, judging by your example
[04:37:23] <dogarrhea2> i don't get a network error
[04:37:29] <duckbox> Dogarrhea2: You have jquery ui, but I can't see the jQuery library itself.
[04:37:52] <dogarrhea2> ok that might be it
[04:38:37] <petermcandrew> :D
[04:39:13] <Hierofant> Hey guys, help.  I just updated a client's site, and when I reloaded in Safari and Mozilla, it works fine.  Chrome it does not.
[04:39:24] <Hierofant> There's some jquery math to get screen sizes
[04:39:33] <Hierofant> ah shit I think I just realized
[04:39:37] <duckbox> :|
[04:39:52] <Hierofant> "24event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future."
[04:40:02] <Hierofant> how do I replace that?
[04:40:04] <duckbox> That should not do anything to your current code.
[04:40:09] <duckbox> For the meantime anyway.
[04:40:17] <Hierofant> well it's the only error I'm getting
[04:40:30] <duckbox> thats a message, not an error.
[04:40:32] <Hierofant> and the math is resulting in images that are 0px wide and 0px tall, but only in Chrome
[04:40:37] <duckbox> Is your site live anywhere ?
[04:41:33] <Hierofant> is there a way to console.log() to chrome?
[04:41:51] <duckbox> console.log( '  msg ' )
[04:41:57] <duckbox> In a nutshell.
[04:42:30] <petermcandrew> but there nothing special about that with chrome right?
[04:44:03] <Hierofant> oh?  Chrome inspector acts like firebug now?
[04:44:41] <duckbox> Always.
[04:47:27] <slax> Guys ive spent all day trying to figure out why IE versions previous to 9 are having problems with my code. I am not getting any kind of error/warning so im totally stuck. I am willing to pay if someone can take their time to help me solve my problems.
[04:48:50] <petermcandrew> there is also firebug light for chrome
[04:51:44] <Hierofant> okay this is bad news.
[04:51:59] <Hierofant> when my page loads, it pulls in a script
[04:52:06] <Hierofant> and preloads some images
[04:52:36] <Hierofant> I get the image size in width and height in pixels, but this doesn't work in Chrome on Windows
[04:52:48] <Hierofant> anyone know why that might be?
[04:52:53] <blackspotwiggins> Hierofant, the images dont have dimensions until they are loaded
[04:53:15] <Hierofant> well it is supposed to preload one
[04:53:24] <blackspotwiggins> well duh
[04:53:30] <blackspotwiggins> but until they ARE in fact, loaded
[04:53:31] <blackspotwiggins> they don't
[04:53:55] <blackspotwiggins> http://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[04:54:06] <Hierofant> okay
[04:55:05] <Hierofant> weird
[04:55:13] <Hierofant> so why does it work in other browsers?
[04:55:56] <Hierofant> $('div.ad-image img').width(); <--- works to get width of image on disk
[04:56:14] <Onkeltem> How to restrict elements by index/number? Like: $('myclass').getOnlyFirst(50)
[04:56:26] <blackspotwiggins> ?:lt @ Onkeltem
[04:56:26] <bot-t1> Onkeltem, :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[04:57:24] <Hierofant> blackspotwiggins is that plugin the only way to get images preloaded or wait until loaded?
[04:57:54] <Talamaska> hi to all
[04:58:22] <blackspotwiggins> Hierofant, "A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded."
[04:58:27] <blackspotwiggins> did you get to that sentence?
[04:58:42] <Hierofant> yes
[04:59:07] <Hierofant> I don't understand why Chrome / Win is the only browser bypassing my image preloader
[05:00:10] <cyberrog> Im trying to parse json inside a .get() method. by passing the returned data to parseJSON. but it doesnt work..
[05:00:33] <nFFF> ?paste @ cyberrog
[05:00:33] <bot-t1> cyberrog, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:00:36] <blackspotwiggins> cyberrog, if you are using "json" datatype it get's parsed automatically
[05:01:00] <cyberrog> hhere is my code http://pastebin.com/YWBWJPrP
[05:01:05] <cyberrog> ok
[05:01:41] <cyberrog> http://jsfiddle.net/tqX5Z/
[05:02:09] <Hierofant> [object Object]is div.ad-image img  <--- may be the actual problem
[05:02:10] <cyberrog> the funny thing is that if I get a json string and wrap it with ' ' it work, but passing only the variable it doesnt work
[05:02:32] <nFFF> whats the domain?
[05:03:12] <nFFF> cyberrog?
[05:03:58] <bencc> is it possible to listen to keyboard events on a div?
[05:04:50] <cyberrog> or I can use getJSON directly. Im gonna use getJSON then.]
[05:07:22] <Talamaska> @bencc yes you can delegate keypress event of the div and in the callback define on what keys you want make action
[05:07:40] <zykes> http://pastebin.com/FuCKrGX3 how can i get the <td> element within success ?
[05:08:04] <Hierofant> if an image loads, and it's one of several in a <div> how would I check what its filename is or any other identifying attributes?
[05:08:36] <Hierofant> $('div.ad-image img[0]')  <-- would [0] yield the object?
[05:09:10] <nFFF> zykes, before ajax use: var curr = $(this);, and then use curr.closest("td").removeClass().html("OPEN")
[05:09:24] <zykes> aha!
[05:10:19] <chee> zykes: your pastebin url contains a swearword
[05:10:30] <chee> please be more careful, we have children here
[05:10:36] <Hierofant> oh no.  What's the oldest version of jquery that updated windows Chrome supports?
[05:10:44] <zykes> oh cause that I can choose chee :p
[05:11:00] <chee> lololo
[05:13:15] <cyberrog> so
[05:13:22] <cyberrog> getJSON didnt work
[05:13:29] <cyberrog> any idea? to use parseJSON?
[05:13:40] <Cork> cyberrog: is the json valid?
[05:13:47] <cyberrog> yeah. validated on jsonLint
[05:13:54] <nFFF> cyberrog, whats the domain -> can you get a wroking example on jsfiddle.net
[05:14:08] <cyberrog> nFFF u want the code?
[05:14:17] <nFFF> a working example
[05:14:17] <Cork> please
[05:14:19] <cyberrog> ok
[05:14:22] <nFFF> would be helpful
[05:14:28] <nFFF> just a minimum test case
[05:14:57] <Cork> nFFF: unless its jsonp it won't work on jsfiddle though
[05:15:11] <Cork> and then its not really json :)
[05:15:17] <nFFF> Ah ok
[05:15:33] <cyberrog> its json

[05:16:07] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/tqX5Z/1/
[05:16:12] <nFFF> does this not log anything?
[05:16:25] <cyberrog> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/vkeFk/1/
[05:16:49] <cyberrog> now try changing the variable inside parseJSON for a json string directly.
[05:17:09] <Cork> cyberrog: why are you using .get instead of getJSON?
[05:17:13] <cyberrog> this is what happens, when I pass the string it works, but with variable it doesnt work. I guess its because the string must be wraped by ' '
[05:17:37] <cyberrog> becaus im making a get request to server that returns a JSON
[05:17:38] <nFFF> cyberrog, see my URL
[05:18:36] <cyberrog> nFFF it prints undefined
[05:18:58] <nFFF> ok just log data
[05:19:05] <nFFF> console.log(data)
[05:19:08] <nFFF> what does it log
[05:19:14] <cyberrog> the json string
[05:19:28] <nFFF> does it have a key first name?
[05:19:34] <cyberrog> yeah
[05:19:36] <cyberrog> of course
[05:19:41] <nFFF> wierd :P
[05:19:49] <nFFF> data.first_name should work
[05:20:04] <Cork> cyberrog: wait a min, you said string
[05:20:06] <cyberrog> test myu link. If I pass a string wrapped by ' ' instead of the variable, it works.
[05:20:10] <cyberrog> yeah
[05:20:23] <Cork> cyberrog: are you sending a json string in a json string?
[05:20:35] <cyberrog> like this '{"name":"John"}'
[05:20:51] <Cork> is that what the log window shows?
[05:21:12] <cyberrog> not this, but in this format
[05:21:16] <cyberrog> it has more keys
[05:21:23] <Cork> with the '' around it?
[05:21:50] <nFFF> It's not a json :D
[05:21:55] <Cork> ya
[05:21:56] <cyberrog> no
[05:22:01] <nFFF> its jsut a string containing a  json
[05:22:02] <cyberrog> without ' '
[05:22:22] <cyberrog> but the documentation asks the json wraped with ' '. check her http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[05:22:28] <cyberrog> here*
[05:22:50] <Cork> cyberrog: theres no need to use parseJSON
[05:22:54] <Cork> just use getJSON
[05:23:27] <mart_> hi! need help with validation. Form is in modal box(fancybox) and i'm not using submit button. Can this combination break validation?
[05:23:27] <nFFF> Cork, apparantly though the returned JSON isn't a json
[05:23:36] <cyberrog> getJSON accept parameters?
[05:23:41] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/tqX5Z/1/
[05:23:48] <nFFF> logs undefined for him
[05:23:50] <cyberrog> nFFF of course it is I validated it
[05:23:52] <cyberrog> here is my jsoin
[05:23:57] <Cork> cyberrog: it excepts the same params that get does
[05:24:11] <nFFF> Cork is there anyhting wrong with the above jsfiddle
[05:24:15] <nFFF> maybe I missed something
[05:24:28] <cyberrog> {"id":"57","first_name":"Test","last_name":"asdg","passport":"1233","baggage":"1","carry_ons":"2","meal":"any","seat":"seat_06 C;seat_07 B;seat_08 C;seat_res08 Y;seat_11 B;"}
[05:24:31] <cyberrog> there it is
[05:24:34] <cyberrog> this is my json
[05:24:46] <Cork> ok, one min
[05:24:49] <cyberrog> and I try, jQuery.parseJSON(data), and it does nothing
[05:25:17] <cyberrog> but if I try jQuery.parseJSON('{"id":"57","first_name":"Test","last_name":"asdg","passport":"1233","baggage":"1","carry_ons":"2","meal":"any","seat":"seat_06 C;seat_07 B;seat_08 C;seat_res08 Y;seat_11 B;"}')  and it works
[05:25:59] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/tqX5Z/2/
[05:26:13] <nFFF> your server cannot be returning that json object :<
[05:26:34] <Hierofant> Damn.  Even when the image is loaded, I can't get its width or height in Chrome.
[05:26:34] <cyberrog> nFFF how that was validated then??
[05:27:39] <nFFF> I think perhaps it's returning a string and not the object
[05:27:44] <nFFF> maybe Cork can help
[05:28:37] <Hierofant> how is it that console.log stopped working in Firefox 9 suddenly
[05:28:44] <nFFF> cyberrog
[05:28:45] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/tqX5Z/4/
[05:28:45] * Hierofant restarts all browsers
[05:28:48] <nFFF> this is what I mean
[05:28:56] <nFFF> notice the difference between the two
[05:29:29] <cyberrog> well. I logged the json
[05:29:38] <cyberrog> and its not in that format
[05:29:46] <cyberrog> its not wrapped in ' '
[05:30:37] <cyberrog> i tested it now
[05:30:49] <sanguisdex> I need to get the values of all selected radio inputs but I just can't seem to get an output value. http://jsfiddle.net/joshbeauregard/NQd8K/
[05:31:39] <cyberrog> also I logged jQuery.parseJSON(data) and it logged an object with the data inside
[05:32:09] <Cork> cyberrog: try Object.keys(data)
[05:32:21] <cyberrog> its working.
[05:32:31] <cyberrog> with object.first_name
[05:32:32] <cyberrog> etc.
[05:32:38] <cyberrog> thanks for ur help.
[05:32:54] <Cork> cyberrog: are you using get() or .getJSON() now?
[05:33:16] <cyberrog> .get()
[05:33:23] <Cork> ...
[05:33:27] * Cork gives up
[05:33:44] <nFFF> ?
[05:33:49] <cyberrog> Cork what..
[05:33:51] <nFFF> What was the solution?
[05:34:03] <cyberrog> why u want me to use getJSON() ?
[05:34:15] <Cork> why duble parse it?
[05:34:26] <Cork> *dubble
[05:34:32] <nFFF> double*
[05:34:35] <nFFF> :D
[05:34:39] <nFFF> cyberrog, what was the solution
[05:34:42] <Cork> ya, ya
[05:34:47] <nFFF> Id be interested to know
[05:34:56] <Cork> je uses get and then takes the response and parses it to json
[05:35:00] <Cork> *he
[05:35:28] <nFFF> Im curious to why http://jsfiddle.net/tqX5Z/1/ wouldnt work
[05:35:36] <cyberrog> nFFF he is suggesting me to use .getJSON() instead of .get().
[05:35:54] <cyberrog> I guess its because of the parameters
[05:36:03] <Hierofant> hey guys, what am I doing wrong?  I have:  <div class="ad-image"><img src="fun.jpg"></div>   but  when I do console.log($('div.ad-image img').src I get undefined.  Only in Chrome for Windows.
[05:36:18] <Cork> cyberrog: no
[05:36:21] <cyberrog> getJSON Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request
[05:36:37] <Cork> ya, so it does the EXACT same thing as get
[05:36:42] <cyberrog> in my case I must call the server that will select the data from database, build the json and return it.
[05:36:49] <Cork> except it sets the dataType to 'json'
[05:36:58] <cyberrog> does the same.
[05:37:03] <cyberrog> whats the difference??
[05:37:08] <cyberrog> if I will have to parse it anyways
[05:37:27] <Cork> you do extra work, for no apperent reason
[05:37:35] <cyberrog> what is the extra work?
[05:37:51] <Cork> the code is already inside .ajax
[05:38:07] <Cork> it handels it internaly, and then you go through that, and pares it again
[05:38:28] <Talamaska> @sanguisdex nothing personal but do you realize that you'll have only one radio checked?
[05:38:29] <chrismou> Hierofant: Try console.log($('div.ad-image img').attr('src')); ?
[05:38:39] <cyberrog> Cork I dont get ur point. anyways. thanks for ur help.
[05:38:40] <Talamaska> why you need to each
[05:38:42] <cyberrog> a lot.
[05:38:57] <Hierofant> thx chrismou - been a while since I jqueried
[05:39:03] <cyberrog> also I dont want to use $.each() function.
[05:40:54] <cyberrog> Cork one question..
[05:40:57] <Hierofant> chrismou would you know why an image src can be gotten, but other attributes such as width() and height() cannot?
[05:41:05] <cyberrog> how did you wrote that phrase with color? LOL
[05:41:11] <cyberrog> could u teach me?
[05:47:16] <Ortund> can someone help me figure out what's going on at http://www.homemation.co.za in IE8?
[05:47:49] <nFFF> Wht an ambigious request :>
[05:47:56] <Ortund> The page loads, flashes on screen and then the whole browser window goes white permanently. There's quite a few javascript errors there
[05:48:16] <Ortund> nFFF, I've got no idea what's causing the problems
[05:51:36] <cyberrog> why this only relace the first text and not the others? http://jsfiddle.net/xsKvd/1/
[05:52:06] <Hierofant> Hey.  Shouldn't all the images be loaded when I do $(window).load(function() {};  ?
[05:52:48] <antdillon> cyberrog, thats just a string
[05:52:51] <Hierofant> isn't that the intent behind $(window).load?  it runs after all assets are DLed?
[05:53:12] <cyberrog> antdillon, well, it should replace, right??
[05:53:27] <cyberrog> IDK why it only replace the first seat_
[05:53:30] <antdillon> cyberrog, replace what?
[05:54:35] <cyberrog> check my link. I have a string like this seat_01 A; seat_01 B; seat_01 C;  and I want to replace all this seat_ for ''. And it replaces only the first seat_. got it?
[05:55:16] <Hierofant> var is_chrome = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome') > -1;   <--- does this still work?
[05:55:46] <cyberrog> antdillon got it?
[05:55:59] <antdillon> cyberrog, yes testing now
[05:57:00] <Jesterous> Hey all. I think this is a simple question! I don't know any jQuery (yet!), I'm trying to get one of these scrollbars to work on my Wordpress site: http://www.nikolaydyankov.com/lionbars/ , but I'm clearly doing something dumb!!
[05:57:07] <antdillon> cyberrog, try: str.replace(/seat_/g,'');
[05:57:08] <nFFF> cyberrog your string in your jsfiddle
[05:57:30] <cyberrog> nFFF what??
[05:57:49] <MagePsycho> Which #jQuery slider do you use for #Magento?, need to survery, plz help.
[05:58:02] <nFFF> isn't seat_01 x3 it's seat_*
[05:58:12] <antdillon> cyberrog, the replace function only replaces the first instance /string/g replaces all instances
[05:58:13] <Jesterous> I'm not sure where to put the .lionbars() function
[05:58:54] <cyberrog> antdillon works like a charm. Thanks!
[05:59:03] <antdillon> cyberrog, no prob
[06:03:02] <Jesterous> This is a gist of the source code from the page in question... try not to laugh too hard! :P https://gist.github.com/1817141
[06:13:59] <Jesterous> Any chance of some advice? I thiinnnk it's really easy.
[06:16:42] <antdillon> Jesterous, You need to put the .lionbars function inside a ready function
[06:17:40] <antdillon> Jesterous, $(document).ready( $('.hentry').lionbars(); });
[06:18:06] <antdillon> Jesterous, your trying to apply the function before the page has finished rendering
[06:18:37] <Jesterous> Ok, thanks for that! Don't have a clue what I'm doing with jQuery... :S
[06:18:53] <antdillon> Jesterous, you'll get there
[06:18:57] <rroelofs> also I seem to remember having to do something special to use the $ function in wordpress.  Using jQuery() has always worked for me.
[06:19:15] <Hierofant> I think I'm losin my mind
[06:19:26] <Hierofant> I have fixed my site except for one file
[06:19:41] <Hierofant> it's identical to others, and only gives erratic behavior in Chrome
[06:19:52] <Hierofant> I have restarted chrome, reuploaded file.
[06:20:15] <Hierofant> does chrome have persistent TSR caching or something?
[06:20:49] <Jesterous> antdillon: Hopefully, I'm planning on learning it soon! :)
[06:21:15] <Jesterous> antdillon: Have tried that, but still no luck unfortunately..
[06:21:56] <Hierofant> Let me ask a different way:  If you have assets loading in Safari and no errors, but a series of weird and seemingly non-reproducing errors in Chrome, how would you debug?
[06:22:01] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/840416/
[06:22:15] <LukeNukem> only the like case works, all other likes does not work.can someone help
[06:22:31] <antdillon> Jesterous, can you paste the code like before?
[06:22:56] <Jesterous> Revised version: https://gist.github.com/1817141
[06:23:02] <xrated> Hierofant, activate the developer toolbar in Safari
[06:23:04] <Jesterous> Thanks for the help :)
[06:24:50] <Hierofant> xrated - I found firebug lite for Safari.  Is that what you mean?
[06:25:32] <antdillon> Jesterous, sorry that was my fault (rushing)  $(document).ready(function() { $('.hentry').lionbars(); });
[06:25:36] <xrated> Hierofant: https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/2SafariDeveloperTools/SafariDeveloperTools.html
[06:25:37] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/840416/ -- someone?
[06:25:42] <Hierofant> thanks
[06:25:47] <antdillon> Jesterous, missed the "function() { "
[06:26:18] <antdillon> Jesterous, http://api.jquery.com/ready/ This explains what's happening
[06:26:31] <Hierofant> wow, Safari inspector is identical to Chrome - must be part of webkit
[06:27:08] <xrated> Hierofant, it is. WebKit also includes a remote web inspector
[06:27:44] <Bartzy> I have 2 images, one is above (z-index) the another. How can I make the lower (z-index) image draggable ?
[06:27:55] <Hierofant> xrated - okay, no errors.  I'm going to try to update Safari.  This version is 5.0.4
[06:29:11] <LukeNukem> xrated, can you check this please http://paste.ubuntu.com/840416/
[06:29:25] <xrated>  What's wrong with it
[06:31:15] <LukeNukem> in the switch(case), only the like case works
[06:31:16] <LukeNukem> the others does not
[06:31:25] <Hierofant> xrated this is weird.  It's telling me "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'left' of null"
[06:31:39] <Hierofant> and the code line it gives has no such reference
[06:32:02] <xrated> Are you using jQuery UI?
[06:32:39] <LukeNukem> me?
[06:33:00] <xrated> no @ Hierofant
[06:33:07] <xrated> LukeNukem, what's wrong with the script
[06:33:09] <xrated> What does it not do
[06:33:16] <Hierofant> No I am not
[06:33:20] <LukeNukem> the case "like":
[06:33:21] <LukeNukem> that works
[06:33:33] <LukeNukem> but case "unlike": and so on does not work
[06:33:46] <Hierofant> xrated, when I clicked through on the errors (they are still scrolling into the thousands, you know how that goes)  ... It says:
[06:33:47] <Hierofant> var YouTubePlayerReady; function onYouTubePlayerReady(playerId) { /* alert("player ready! - " + playerId); */ YouTubePlayerReady[playerId] = true; }
[06:33:57] <Hierofant> I did not write that code.
[06:34:21] <xrated> Hierofant, can you fiddle your code?
[06:34:46] <Hierofant> :( no... you'd kill me.  It's thousands of pages
[06:34:50] <Hierofant> lines rather
[06:34:58] <Hierofant> might as well be pages
[06:35:18] <xrated> The best I can tell you is to set breakpoints and step through your code
[06:35:21] <Jesterous> antdillon: Still no luck I'm afraid.. latest: https://gist.github.com/1817141
[06:35:51] <Hierofant> xrated can you think of any reason why it would be fine on Safari and not on Chrome, and only on windows (looks fine on Mac chrome)
[06:36:32] <xrated> Hierofant, well if something like $(el).offset().left was called where el is a non-existant element
[06:36:36] <xrated> Then I suppose that could happen
[06:36:41] <Hierofant> ah
[06:36:57] <xrated> Search for reference to left in your code
[06:36:59] <xrated> and debug from there
[06:37:11] <antdillon> Jesterous, lets try and pop a alert in the ready to check jQuery's running
[06:37:11] <Hierofant> I think I know what it is :(
[06:37:29] <Jesterous> Whatever you say, sir! :P
[06:37:48] <Hierofant> My preload script to load the images isn't working on Chrome for some reason... It actually *is* but the script doesn't get that they're preloaded, or maybe not in time
[06:37:52] <xrated> LukeNukem, a quick look and run through JSLint doesn't tell me much. I'd have to play with it more but I'm at the office :(
[06:38:04] <antdillon> Jesterous, let me know how you get on
[06:39:21] <Jesterous> I dunno how to do that.. :S When I say I don't know jQuery, I mean I know zero! I know html, CSS and have a fairly good idea of PHP, but javascript is a mystery!
[06:39:53] <Hierofant> xrated do you know why this syntax would not work?  $('div.ad-image img').offset();  <-- it's yielding undefined I think
[06:39:54] <Jesterous> Maybe I'm being too ambitious trying this... seemed pretty straightforward though..
[06:40:21] <xrated> Hierofant, is that selector returning anything?
[06:41:45] <Hierofant> xrated er how do you mean returning?
[06:41:52] <Hierofant> like object Object?
[06:42:08] <xrated> Yeah
[06:45:00] <Hierofant> can't tell
[06:45:06] <Hierofant> works fine in firefox
[06:45:12] <Hierofant> but there are too many errors in Chrome
[06:45:15] <Hierofant> tens of thousands
[06:45:53] <discorpia> start with the first one
[06:46:05] <discorpia> usually causes a lot of the rest :P
[06:46:12] <Hierofant> I can't read it
[06:46:20] <Hierofant> it popped up "Settings" and it wont go away
[06:46:26] * Hierofant restarts
[06:47:08] <Hierofant> yeah it just locks up
[06:47:22] <Hierofant> it looks like a problem with jquery 1.4.3
[06:47:48] <Hierofant> b.extend.ready    <--- I think it said this was the problem
[06:48:21] <Sean-Der> Does anyone know a function that would the browsers attention upon an input field? So if the user doesn't fill in a field it will automatically open the field for editing
[06:49:18] <Hierofant> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'adGallery'   <-- adGallery is the div containing the image
[06:50:07] <MagePsycho> Which #jQuery slider do you use for #Magento?, need to survery, plz help.
[06:51:08] <Jesterous> antdillon: any more ideas? Forgot to put your name in my earlier comment...
[06:51:46] <Hierofant> weird.  Is Shadowbox plugin deprecated?
[06:52:50] <antdillon> Jesterous, did you get an alert on the page when you loaded it?
[06:52:52] <Hierofant> this whole thing is really smelly
[06:53:24] <Jesterous> Using the last code I put up? No.
[06:53:44] <Jesterous> andillon: where would it appear?
[06:54:42] <Jesterous> antdillon: It just loaded up as before, with an ordinary scrollbar instead of the lionbars one.
[06:55:18] <michelem> hello folks
[06:55:34] <Hierofant> xrated - It's throwing errors in jquery.   (anonymous function) b.extend.ready     t
[06:55:49] <michelem> how can I avoid the "display: none;" at the end of a fadeOut(), so that layout is not disrupted by the box disappearing?
[06:56:20] <antdillon> Jesterous, Ok lets try and put $(document).ready(function() { alert('It works'); }); instead of $(document).ready(function() { $('#post-120').lionbars(); });
[06:56:52] <antdillon> Jesterous, you should get a pop up when you refresh the page
[06:59:41] <Jesterous> antdillon, Right, tried that, still no luck. I vaguely remember doing alerts when I learned a tiny bit of javascript years ago! Latest: https://gist.github.com/1817141
[06:59:59] <LiohAu> anybody know how can i set a default value for the filter input which is over a list view (in jquery mobile)
[07:00:22] <Jesterous> antdillon, I have a javascript gallery on the page that's working fine.
[07:00:41] <michelem> for the archives: .fadeOut(X) with no trailing "display: none;" â€”> .fadeTo(X, 0);
[07:00:44] <Onkeltem> docs.j.c is under massive load?
[07:01:19] <Onkeltem> is a mirror of docs.j.c?
[07:01:24] <Onkeltem> cant fukin wait
[07:04:02] <Hierofant> Wow.  STILL no errors in Safari, crash city in Chrome.  And Chrome only does it on one folder.   Is it possible that Chrome is vulnerable to session id information from PHP/Ajax calls?
[07:04:13] <antdillon> Jesterous, so if the alert didnt work it seems that jQUery isnt loading
[07:05:31] <Jesterous> antdillon, Hmm, well that's strange as the gallery is working fine! You can see them in the <head> too, just before our function
[07:05:52] <antdillon> Jesterous, try jQuery(document).ready(function($) { alert('It works'); });
[07:06:05] <Hierofant> xrated I temporarily disabled the "left" element... Still getting  Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'adGallery'
[07:06:12] <stanza> hi guys, need a help with :not() selector. $( 'div:not(#endU|#endD) .blocco1 a' ) should match all links not i endU or endD divs. is this right?
[07:06:25] <xrated> oh sorry
[07:06:44] <Hierofant> var galleries = $('.ad-gallery').adGallery();
[07:06:56] <xrated> is the adGallery jquery plugin file being included correctly?
[07:07:14] <nFFF> Hierofant your plugin is obviously not being recognised
[07:07:18] <nFFF> or not added
[07:07:39] <Hierofant> it appears to be
[07:08:20] <Hierofant> no, maybe not.  It's not showing up in scripts
[07:08:27] <Hierofant> only jquery is
[07:08:31] <Hierofant> what would cause that?
[07:08:51] <qwerty57> hi. got 2 containers which have divs with same class. what's the best way to select a class knowing the container id?
[07:08:51] <Hierofant> bad minify?
[07:09:01] <motaka2> I don't know why I can't see the alert when I reload the page here:  http://pastebin.com/7pvdcHhG , is there anything wrong ?
[07:09:02] <Jesterous> antdillon: Hooray!!! That worked and I guessed what you were going to say next, so put in: jQuery(document).ready(function($) { $('.hentry').lionbars(); }); and it's now working!!! :D
[07:09:46] <Jesterous> antdillon, Thanks a lot for that, I appreciate you helping a complete beginner! :)
[07:12:48] <qwerty57> jQuery("#slider-amount").children(".slider-label").attr("id", "test");
[07:12:52] <qwerty57> why it doesn't work?
[07:13:06] <Hierofant> xrated - I may be on to something.  In my file, I have <script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>   but in the rendered output in Chrome, it says, for each .js file,  <script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery-1.4.3.min.js" style="display: none; visibility: hidden; "></script>
[07:13:07] <qwerty57> .slider-label is not an exact children of #slider-amount, but hidden inside somewhere
[07:13:10] <qwerty57> best way to select it?
[07:13:20] <nFFF> $('#slider-amount > .slider-label')
[07:13:33] <Hierofant> Why would chrome add all those styles to a script?
[07:14:03] <xrated> It wouldn't, some script is doing that.
[07:14:04] <antdillon> Jesterous, no problem, glad we got there in the end :)
[07:14:04] <chee> ls
[07:14:16] <chee> perhaps an extension
[07:14:16] <Hierofant> xrated how can I tell what script is doing that?
[07:14:36] <chee> Hierofant: open up in an incognito window and see if it still happens
[07:14:40] <Hierofant> also this is showing up in the source
[07:14:41] <Hierofant> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="data:text/css," style="display: none; visibility: hidden; " disabled="">
[07:14:45] <qwerty57> nFFF:  doesn't work, doesn't add the id
[07:14:57] <chee> if it does then you'll know it's something you've installed
[07:15:07] <chee> Hierofant: in the source or in the web inspector?
[07:15:46] <Jesterous> antdillon, Now I'm off back to #css where I belong! :P Hopefully to come back some day having learned jQuery!
[07:15:47] <Hierofant> chee - GOOD CALL it works fine in Incognito window!  What do you suspect?
[07:16:00] <Hierofant> cookie issue?
[07:16:45] <chee> i suspect an extension
[07:17:45] <chee> Hierofant: i don't know of a better way but going through your extensions and disabling them until you find the offending chap
[07:18:47] <Hierofant> chee - why would an extension only do that on one page, and not others which are identical?
[07:19:56] <Hierofant> yeah hmm
[07:20:04] <Hierofant> disabled all extensions and it worked fine
[07:20:06] <Hierofant> son of a BITCH
[07:20:24] <Hierofant> I was going nuts, commenting tons of code, made a bunch of tester files
[07:20:29] <Hierofant> thanks chee
[07:20:34] <Hierofant> now I can go to bed
[07:20:58] <chee> it's so easy to get people into bed
[07:21:20] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hi, how do you find out if an object exists? like I wanna see if $('#photo_images_carousel') exists as a DOM object or not
[07:22:07] <nFFF> $('#photo_images_carousel').length
[07:22:54] <Hierofant> hehehe
[07:23:06] <Onkeltem> I don't understand how to copy-paste a set of elements?
[07:23:19] <Jesterous> antdillon, A quick question, in case there's an easy way to do this: I'm getting a flash of unstyled content when I load the page i.e. the original scrollbar is flashing up. Is there a solution to this, or is it a fact of life?
[07:23:38] <Onkeltem> for example, I want to 1) find elements, and place them into some place of a tree.
[07:23:45] <Nicolas_Leonidas> what does $('#photo_images_carousel').length do?
[07:24:02] <Hierofant> chee - I was seriously wondering why the client wasn't calling me, freaking out... also why it looked fine in Safari and FF, and even other ppls' Chrome
[07:24:03] <Onkeltem> Nicolas_Leonidas: returns number of elements
[07:24:17] <Nicolas_Leonidas> right, let me try that
[07:25:03] <Onkeltem> I get all the links $('a') and now want to append them somewhere. If I do $(..).append($('a')) it inserts text '[object Object]'
[07:25:12] <Onkeltem> how to actually insert them?
[07:25:41] <nFFF> Nicolas_Leonidas
[07:25:42] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/vyjKm/
[07:25:56] <nFFF> Onkeltem
[07:26:00] <nFFF> $('a')
[07:26:04] <nFFF> returns an object
[07:26:06] <nFFF> hence
[07:26:12] <nFFF> [object Object]
[07:26:25] <Nicolas_Leonidas> nFFF: got it, thank you
[07:26:59] <Onkeltem> nFFF: yes, but I was expecting jQuery's .append() would convert them into nodes
[07:27:12] <nFFF> If only life was so easy :D
[07:27:12] <Onkeltem> nFFF: if not, how can I do it?
[07:27:30] <nFFF> iterate through each <a and add them to a var
[07:27:39] <nFFF> or not even
[07:27:42] <nFFF> append them one by one
[07:28:06] <Onkeltem> nFFF: don't understand. Adding single a doesn't work too btw
[07:28:26] <nFFF> You want to grab every <a element on the page
[07:28:29] <nFFF> and append it to an element
[07:28:39] <nFFF> ?
[07:29:02] <Onkeltem> nFFF: yes
[07:29:11] <nFFF> Ok
[07:29:19] <nFFF> ?paste @ Onkeltem
[07:29:19] <bot-t1> Onkeltem, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:29:23] <Onkeltem> .append($('a').eq()) - does same - [object Object]
[07:29:24] <nFFF> use jsfiddle
[07:29:29] <nFFF> and paste what you have
[07:29:38] <nFFF> you can't do that
[07:29:47] <Onkeltem> I'm playing with Chrome console, not having real code
[07:29:55] <nFFF> that will only select the first a element
[07:29:59] <nFFF> for a start
[07:30:06] <Onkeltem> yes
[07:30:29] <nFFF> There's multiple <a elements?
[07:30:32] <Onkeltem> yes
[07:30:34] <nFFF> or you only want tod o it for one?
[07:30:46] <nFFF> Ok so you need to iterate over the DOM and append each element
[07:30:51] <Onkeltem> I want to collect them all for example
[07:31:31] <Onkeltem> Can't I just concatenate array of objects, converting them into HTML nodes with jQuery?
[07:32:14] <blackspotwiggins> Onkeltem, can you tell in one sentence wtfd you are trying to do?
[07:32:43] <Onkeltem> blackspotwiggins: collect all the links and plece them into a div
[07:32:47] <Onkeltem> place*
[07:32:55] <blackspotwiggins> $("a").appendTo("#somediv")
[07:33:23] <Onkeltem> blackspotwiggins: :)
[07:35:00] <nFFF> that will only select the first element?
[07:35:29] <Onkeltem> nFFF: no, selected all of them
[07:35:42] <Onkeltem> blackspotwiggins: works like charm, thank you
[07:36:01] <nFFF> Ah ok :>
[07:36:46] <Onkeltem> blackspotwiggins: lol. That moved all my links into the div!
[07:36:55] <blackspotwiggins> that's exactly what you asked for
[07:37:07] <Onkeltem> blackspotwiggins: okay, I need to .clone() I think
[07:37:18] <qwerty57> http://pastebin.com/3euZ6RNb
[07:37:24] <qwerty57> why it doesn't hide .slider-label ?!
[07:38:02] <Hierofant> blackspotwiggins xrated chee thanks for your help. gentlemen
[07:38:26] <chee> ^_^
[07:38:28] <blackspotwiggins> gontlomon
[07:40:47] <qwerty57>  jQuery("#slider-amount > .ui-slider-handle > .slider-label").attr("id", "asd");
[07:40:48] <qwerty57> worked
[07:40:48] <qwerty57> :)
[07:46:23] <MagePsycho> Which #jQuery slider do you use for #Magento?, need to survery, plz help.
[07:49:37] <johnkpaul> MagePsycho: what do you mean use for magento?
[07:49:42] <johnkpaul> magento doesn't have one built in, you can pick
[07:49:52] <MagePsycho> yes
[07:50:10] <MagePsycho> but i want jquery plugins for slider ..say top 3
[07:52:57] <motaka2> Is this wrong?  $("span#errors_id_inds_invests_3").hide(); ?
[07:54:18] <chee> it depends what you want to do
[07:55:47] <chee> motaka2: do you want to hide a span with id errors_id_inds_invests_3 ?
[07:56:01] <chee> motaka2: like so? <span id='errors_id_inds_invests_3'>Hello</span>
[07:56:07] <chee> if so, then no
[07:56:11] <motaka2> chee: Thanks for your care it is solved right now
[07:57:03] <chee> how fortifying
[07:57:12] <nFFF> You ask if its right and then test? :D
[07:59:08] <motaka2> no, there was a mistake I solved
[08:00:53] <iamcurio> how can i make the footer always fill the rest of the page with query?
[08:01:06] <LukeNukem> how to make page reload without actually reloading it.
[08:01:17] <LukeNukem> i mean to reload it but user should not know it reload
[08:01:21] <LukeNukem> after ajax request
[08:02:53] <NoiseEee> LukeNukem: that IS ajax/xhr
[08:02:58] <nFFF> :>
[08:03:47] <LukeNukem> okay
[08:03:47] <johnkpaul> MagePsycho: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/ is probably the #1
[08:04:40] <MagePsycho> johnkpaul: i mean image slider like nivo slider
[08:04:48] <johnkpaul> ooh
[08:04:51] <johnkpaul> I call that carousel
[08:05:00] <johnkpaul> jCarousel and jCarouelLite
[08:05:03] <johnkpaul> are very popular
[08:05:20] <johnkpaul> also, those are fairly trivial to write on your own
[08:05:28] <johnkpaul> if you need custom animations
[08:11:02] <microhxo> guys, i am trying to make a label click event handler, i am looking for specific labels. but my code isnt working. It breaks right on the if on doc load: http://paste2.org/p/1903090
[08:13:10] <Ariel_Calzada> hi, how to change accordion active div ???
[08:14:53] <johnkpaul> Ariel_Calzada: .accordion({active:YOUR_DIV/SELECTOR})
[08:15:33] <Ariel_Calzada> johnkpaul: i mean in runtime
[08:17:18] <NoiseEee> microhxo: looks like you're actually using JS to do the same thing that clicking on a <label> already does!
[08:17:22] <ajpiano> Ariel_Calzada: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#method-activate
[08:17:48] <microhxo> NoiseEee, i want to execute specific code when specific labels are clicked
[08:17:56] <microhxo> so when i click username, i want to execute a custom function
[08:18:34] <NoiseEee> microhxo: that involves more than just focusing the associated <input>?  if so, what errors are you getting in your console?
[08:18:43] <microhxo> No errors.
[08:18:55] <NoiseEee> so... whats not working?
[08:18:59] <microhxo> the focus was not the issue
[08:19:02] <microhxo> i will be replacing that
[08:19:16] <NoiseEee> well try replicating your issue on a jsfiddle
[08:22:31] <effectclient> is there a list of attributes for html element which i can abuse to store data?
[08:23:39] <binil> effectclient: heard of 'data-' attribute in html5?
[08:24:22] <effectclient> yeah but html5 is not availible in most of the browser versions
[08:25:08] <xec> effectclient: you can safely use data- attributes in older browsers too, afaik
[08:25:32] <LukeNukem> hi can someone tell me how to grab the string inside an element using class
[08:26:08] <benbin> LukeNukem:$('.class').text()?
[08:26:30] <xec> effectclient: http://caniuse.com/dataset
[08:26:58] <xec> see the note at the bottom
[08:27:55] <effectclient> with "access" does it mean i cant read the values in some browsers?
[08:28:37] <xec> effectclient: what makes you think that?
[08:29:20] <effectclient> sorry i am not a native speaker. so if i look at the table it seems every single browser and its versions supports this?
[08:29:26] <xec> yes
[08:29:42] <effectclient> and what does "Partially supported" mean in this matteR?
[08:29:53] <xec> it's the .dataset() property thats not supported in older browsers
[08:29:58] <xec> but you don't need it
[08:30:26] <effectclient> what exactly does .dataset() do?
[08:30:36] <kanzie> My struggle with the memory-leak continues and I have yet not found anything that revolves it. The biggest problem is that the memory keeps building looking in the task manager, however timelines only shows a small memory-increase. Reloading the tab in Chrome does not release the memory. What should I do_
[08:30:55] <xec> effectclient: gives you a cleaner api access to all the data- attributes
[08:31:05] <effectclient> i see. thank you
[08:31:30] <xec> effectclient: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.dataset
[08:32:47] <xec> effectclient: of course, no IE support, but you can do basically the same without dataset by using http://api.jquery.com/data/
[08:34:15] <saschagehlich> hey, is there a way to call .html() asynchronously? right now if I put 5kb of data into a div via .html(data), it blocks for like 300ms or something like thatâ€¦
[08:34:17] <effectclient> ohh nice
[08:34:28] <effectclient> xec: thanks for the links
[08:35:18] <chaines51> okay, I have a form, in a table, with two inputs per row. Is there any selector I can make to get from one input to the next?
[08:35:41] <chaines51> something like $(this).nextAll('input:first')
[08:35:49] <chaines51> but with some tr and td action in there
[08:36:14] <xec> chaines51: could you pastebin your markup?
[08:36:30] <nFFF> could use find?
[08:36:54] <nFFF>  $(this).find('input:first'); ?
[08:37:11] <xec> nFFF: i assume "this" is an input field
[08:37:26] <xec> nFFF: and therefore doubt you find an input field inside it ;)
[08:37:39] <nFFF> :P
[08:38:05] <saschagehlich> $(this).next()
[08:38:23] <xec> saschagehlich: that's just the next sibling (if there is one)
[08:38:39] <saschagehlich> and he would like to find all siblings that come after "this"?
[08:38:43] <chaines51> http://pastebin.com/FK7LsLUg
[08:38:46] <chaines51> that's the markup
[08:38:53] <chaines51> i'm not sure there's a reasonable way to do it.
[08:38:58] <chaines51> that's why I came here :P
[08:40:51] <xec> yeah i don't see a simple solution either
[08:41:01] <ajpiano> $(this).parent().next().find("input")
[08:41:39] <xec> ajpiano: thats a start, but the parent is a <td> so you would never get to the next row
[08:41:47] <chaines51> that only works within the same row.
[08:41:48] <cyberrog> im trying to change the title attribute of a div, but nothing happens. $('#dialog').attr('title', 'Test User');
[08:41:49] <ajpiano> what are you actually trying to do?
[08:42:01] <ajpiano> find the input in the same column, the next row down?
[08:42:23] <chaines51> just the *next* input in the dom.
[08:42:38] <chaines51> as in, if you're at the end of a row, go to the first input in the next row
[08:42:42] <ajpiano> ah
[08:43:07] <ajpiano> var inputs = $("input"), index = inputs.index( this ), next = inputs.eq
[08:43:12] <ajpiano> var inputs = $("input"), index = inputs.index( this ), next = inputs.eq( index + 1 );
[08:44:04] <chaines51> yea, that's what I was planning on doing. I was just trying to figure out if there was an actual selector to do it.
[08:44:29] <ajpiano> nope
[08:45:17] <cyberrog> how do I set the title attr of a div. this doesnt work: $('#dialog').attr('title', 'Test User');
[08:46:54] <johnkpaul> cyberrog: that's surprising, that should work, are you sure that $("#dialog") is returning a jQuery wrapped dom eement?
[08:47:07] <johnkpaul> is your code running afterdom ready
[08:47:16] <cyberrog> yeah.
[08:47:53] <johnkpaul> can you log $("#dialog") to the console and ensure that it's finding the elemtnt
[08:50:23] <cyberrog> johnkpaul it logged the div
[08:50:50] <cyberrog> johnkpaul actually it is setting the title, but its just no printing it
[08:50:52] <cyberrog> =/
[08:51:00] <johnkpaul> printing?
[08:51:56] <johnkpaul> do you mean the tooltip that apepars when you hover over it?
[08:51:57] <cyberrog> yeah, I'm using jquery dialog example, and it should print the value on the dialog title
[08:52:40] <johnkpaul> is the call to dialog({}) after you change the attribute?
[08:52:43] <johnkpaul> can you show us a fiddle?
[08:53:30] <cyberrog> johnkpaul no, its before
[08:53:45] <cyberrog> no wait. first I set the value and later I call dialog
[08:54:05] <johnkpaul> cyberrog: can you show us the code?
[08:57:12] <cyberrog> johnkpaul http://jsfiddle.net/gRHyT/
[08:58:08] <johnkpaul> so it's opened before the ajax call is returnd
[08:58:18] <johnkpaul> so at the time the dialog box is opened, there is no title
[08:58:48] <cyberrog> yeah, in the code the title attr is there but not in the dialog itself.
[08:59:01] <kryl> hi, do you know a lib or other to change image with fading every 10sec per example ?
[08:59:11] <cyberrog> its opend after the ajax call
[08:59:47] <johnkpaul> text in the "title" attribute is not displayed unless you mouse over
[09:00:00] <johnkpaul> I think you want $( "#dialog" ).dialog({ title: 'Dialog Title' });
[09:00:08] <johnkpaul> after your ajax call has completed successfully
[09:00:38] <johnkpaul> cyberrog: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-title
[09:00:46] <cyberrog> johnkpaul lemme test.
[09:01:50] <cyberrog> johnkpaul now it works! Thanks a lot!
[09:01:59] <johnkpaul> no problem
[09:02:11] <johnkpaul> read through that jquery ui docs page, it'll get you familiar with all you can do with the dialog
[09:02:38] <cyberrog> ok. thanks.
[09:19:29] <LukeNukem> ben_alman, are you benbin/binil
[09:22:24] <ben_alman> LukeNukem: wat
[09:22:46] <LukeNukem> sorry
[09:23:55] <michelem> what's the best practice for emulating "the user changed the value of input type=text" ?
[09:24:14] <michelem> I see that onChange only triggers when the user has removed focus from the input
[09:24:24] <hexa___> onkeypress
[09:25:11] <michelem> onKeyUp not better for bulking together hold-downs ?
[09:26:49] <michelem> onkeyup seems to do.
[09:27:25] <qwerty57> need suggestions. i've got a clock with 2 arrows which I need to animate turning by steps when clicking + and - buttons. what would be the best way to do it? image per each turn, angle rotate arrow, etc?
[09:28:34] <Cryp71c> Can you create tags and store them into a javascript variable by using var someItem = $('<a/>', arrayOfAttributes); ?
[09:29:44] <ajpiano> Cryp71c: yes
[09:29:58] <snover> except thatâ€™s not an array
[09:30:35] <snover> other than thatâ€¦! :)
[09:31:21] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to see if a form already has a custom submit handler or a link already has a custom click handler? so i don't accidentally assign over it
[09:31:40] <nicovalencia> Has anyone ever seen an ajax post try to querify the post params?
[09:32:05] <ajpiano> tomasm-: event handlers don't overwrite each other, they just stack up
[09:32:23] <nicovalencia> Oh hai ajpiano ^_-
[09:32:28] <ajpiano> hey nicovalencia !!
[09:32:37] <tomasm-> ajpiano, yes, i mean i dont want more than one submit handler for a form or click handler for a link.... i want to find out what the queue is for a given event type (click, submit)
[09:32:57] <ajpiano> tomasm-: you can look at it from $("#elem").data("events") and that'll return an object
[09:33:04] <ajpiano> but it's undocumented and not guaranteed to work forever
[09:33:42] <ravenzz> ajpiano isn't there a way to do that in plain js?
[09:34:08] <ajpiano> to tap into the jquery event system where jquery stores it's data and events inside of jQuery.cache ?
[09:34:29] <ajpiano> there is probably a way, but i wouldn't advise it
[09:34:55] <ravenzz> oh you're correct, sorry
[09:40:37] <LukeNukem> How to make the page reload but make it not look like its actually reloading
[09:40:51] <kaylee> any chance someone here can help me with jCarousel?
[09:41:05] <nFFF> LukeNukem :<<<<<<<<<
[09:41:22] <kaylee> I've got 6 items in my list... it expands beyond what the clipping will show...
[09:41:43] <kaylee> why is it making the window expand horizontally?
[09:47:59] <aqeel> any got big mons
[09:48:09] <aqeel> need to test my layout
[09:48:48] <aqeel> finally i got my hove and toggle working
[09:48:57] <aqeel> *hover
[09:52:31] <DarkSector> Hi, I have $(this).attr("id") returning circle-01 and I'd like to change the circle-01 to circle_01.png how do I do that? I need to pass it to the url for .css("background-image", "url()")
[09:53:26] <nFFF> DarkSector
[09:53:32] <nFFF> attr() can take two arguments
[09:53:47] <nFFF> $(this).attr("id",'circle_01.png')
[09:54:12] <briancray> and if you need to do the latter, variable assignment is pretty basic
[09:54:21] <briancray> var foo = $(this).attr("id");
[09:54:36] <briancray> .css("background-image", "url(' + foo + '.png' + )")
[09:54:48] <DarkSector> nFFF: oh! wait let me be more clear. I think I misstated the problem http://pastie.org/3375130
[09:55:06] <DarkSector> oh yes I think I wanna do what briancray is saying
[09:55:10] <DarkSector> let me try that
[09:55:27] <briancray> note that I forgot an apostrophe
[09:55:35] <briancray> .css("background-image", "url(' + foo + '.png' + ')")
[09:55:49] <DarkSector> briancray: what about replacement circle-01 to circle_01
[09:55:52] <briancray> oh, and those should be double quotations
[09:56:04] <briancray> foo.replace('-', '_');
[09:56:12] <DarkSector> yes but how can it be done inline
[09:56:24] <microhxo> Does anyone have any experience working with Telerik grids?
[09:56:27] <DarkSector> or do I have to create a separate function and return the whole url to url()
[09:56:30] <briancray> .css("background-image", "url(' + foo.replace('-', '_') + '.png' + )")
[09:56:45] <DarkSector> wow, this is pretty cool
[09:56:49] <briancray> .css("background-image", "url(" + foo.replace('-', '_') + ".png" + )")
[09:56:51] <briancray> .css("background-image", "url(" + foo.replace('-', '_') + ".png" + ")")
[09:56:57] <briancray> there it is
[09:57:13] <DarkSector> let me try that out, thanks
[09:58:01] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com.......click detail and hover over and click ....mm and sm
[09:58:13] <briancray> or: (function (url) { return $(this).css("background-image","url(" + url + ")"); })($(this).replace('-', '_') + '.png');
[09:58:17] <briancray> that's all in one line
[09:58:50] <DarkSector> I'll try both, this is really cool
[09:59:03] <briancray> heh
[09:59:53] <DarkSector> okay why is the operation between + and + is that standard syntax? like escape sequence for parsing?
[09:59:54] <briancray> actually the second option wouldn't work
[10:00:05] <briancray> because this would be different
[10:00:22] <microhxo> Does anyone have any experience working with Telerik grids?
[10:00:25] <briancray> + is string concatenation
[10:00:35] <DarkSector> but why is it there in the front?
[10:00:46] <DarkSector> and what if I wanted to prepend something
[10:01:04] <DarkSector> isn't it better to use prepend() and append() for that matter
[10:01:26] <David_Bradbury> So I normally do an event listener with jQuery using $("#filter-pane>div>div").click(...) - But I've recently had to switch to using $().on - I tried doing $("#filter-pane>").on("click","div>div",...), but no combination of using the direct descender seems to work
[10:01:27] <briancray> are you talking about prepending dom elements, or a string to another stirng
[10:02:12] <DarkSector> briancray: string to string because the url() has to be passed a string right? I mean the path is a string so if I wanted the id say circle-01 to be changed to ../img/circle_01.png that is a string right?
[10:02:24] <kanzie> do I need to consider unbinding or something if I have a on()-statement to a class-name and then I do a html()-operation to replace a bunch of elements with this class or does jquery handle this for me?
[10:02:27] <DarkSector> too many rights
[10:02:46] <briancray> .css("background-image", "url(../img/" + foo.replace('-', '_') + ".png" + ")")
[10:02:52] <aqeel> element>element is the method and not elment>(this cannot be left blank)
[10:03:12] <aqeel> yes on needs off
[10:03:35] <DarkSector> Oh! " in the braces are a part of the string
[10:03:39] <DarkSector> are they not?
[10:03:57] <briancray> David_Bradbury div>div is too ambiguous for descendent selection
[10:04:05] <briancray> disambiguate it with something like a class name
[10:04:17] <briancray> due to bubbling stuff
[10:05:05] <David_Bradbury> Fair enough
[10:05:26] <aqeel> html no need on...it does replaces with simply html on the selector
[10:06:55] <aqeel> i have done on my site using text and html.....on hover......jailbreak.webege.com
[10:07:34] <kanzie> aqeel: I am seeing a lot of memory leaks on detached DOM-elements though and circular references caused by html() would explain it
[10:07:40] <kanzie> are you sure
[10:08:17] <aqeel> ?explain in detail
[10:08:21] <bot-t> aqeel, Animated Effect | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/animated-effect
[10:08:52] <DarkSector> briancray: okay I've come up with this, but it doesn't seem to be working
[10:08:53] <DarkSector> http://pastie.org/3375130
[10:08:54] <aqeel> bot-t sorry page not found
[10:09:48] <aqeel> kanzie can u elaborate it...so i can rectify my problem
[10:10:12] <kanzie> rectify your problem?
[10:10:19] <aqeel> well i used functions without encasulating in $(function()){}
[10:10:38] <aqeel> <kanzie> aqeel: I am seeing a lot of memory leaks on detached DOM-elements though and circular references caused by html() would explain it
[10:10:58] <aqeel> where are the memory leaks?
[10:11:12] <aqeel> circular references....
[10:11:19] <aqeel> please advice...
[10:11:19] <kanzie> aaah. I think we both have a problem. Im not assistingg in resolving your problem
[10:11:37] <aqeel> no at least hint me...
[10:14:06] <aqeel> i am sure this would be the cause.....$(function()){my html()...coding}
[10:18:52] <_ramo> good evening
[10:19:49] <_ramo> what does this means: $(function() { ? or if something starts with: (function($) {        $.fn.extend({.... });})(jQuery); ?
[10:20:59] <Giverny> _ramo ;(function($){ $.fn.extend({.... });})(jQuery); this is for plugins
[10:21:56] <_ramo> Giverny: what does that mean exactly?
[10:21:57] <Giverny> _ralph $(function(){ ... }); = $(document).ready(function(){ ... });
[10:22:03] <Giverny> _ramo
[10:22:20] <_ramo> i still don't understand
[10:22:28] <_ralph> Thanks for that Giverny :-)
[10:22:38] <gehsekky> _ramo: it's a self-executing anonymous function
[10:23:07] <Giverny> _ramo and avoid conflicts between javascript libraries
[10:23:28] <gehsekky> (function(param) { statements to run } ) (param to pass into above function)
[10:23:55] <_ramo> gehsekky: so the last (jQuery) is passed into the statements used before?
[10:24:00] <gehsekky> yes
[10:24:16] <nFFF> Can you do $.jQuery(function() {?
[10:24:32] <nFFF> err jQuery(function($){
[10:25:04] <nFFF> I have a load of conflicting javascript libraries
[10:25:16] <nFFF> on a site, like prototype that other developers have used
[10:25:27] <nFFF> gets tiring having to type jQuery everytime
[10:25:29] <Giverny> you can use $j('selector')....
[10:25:39] <Giverny> jQuery('selector').
[10:25:45] <nFFF> can I wrap my code around a function
[10:25:52] <nFFF> so i can use $ inside instead of jQuery
[10:26:02] <aqeel> sure u can
[10:26:09] <Giverny> yes
[10:26:27] <aqeel> therefore there is noconflict too
[10:26:51] <aqeel> so u can make use of other libraries too
[10:27:53] <Giverny> nFFF http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[10:28:32] <Giverny> this is all about conflict in jquery
[10:29:34] <nFFF> thanks
[10:29:43] <DarkSector> holycrap I just realized what briancray was trying to explain </epiphany> thanks mate, if you're still around
[10:32:18] <David_Bradbury> Any library that uses $ without an option to not use $ is just silly
[10:32:35] <David_Bradbury> I'd personally keep $ for jQuery and use whatever the other library's alias is :p
[10:32:53] <nFFF> How si the precedence set?
[10:33:03] <nFFF> Is it which ever library is included first?
[10:33:34] <David_Bradbury> Well, if another library is called later that says they want to use $, then it will likely overwrite whatever the first library said
[10:33:40] <aqeel> no it is the method each library uses to code
[10:35:36] <aqeel> order of libraries does not matter but the order of your eternal js created does....
[10:38:10] <aqeel> y r u using so many libraries....jquery is vast and versatile already....i merely need otehr library
[10:49:38] <buddyq> having trouble with php inside jquery...
[10:49:52] <buddyq> Trying this: jQuery("#message .divMessage").html('<h2>Please wait while your site is being created!</h2><img src='"<?php echo $this->baseurl ?>"'/templates/"<?php echo $this->template;?>"/images/loading.gif\" />").parent().parent().overlay();
[10:50:08] <jedimind> uhm
[10:50:13] <buddyq> http://pastebin.com/KyUsvBPH
[10:50:19] <jedimind> that's a problem with not understanding basic javascript syntax
[10:50:34] <buddyq> the php is not getting rendered...
[10:50:34] <jedimind> src = "sometihng" + variable + " something else...";
[10:50:51] <buddyq> jedi... I tried something like that but it printed out the + signs.
[10:50:53] <jedimind> also why do you have ' and " quotes around your php variables
[10:51:04] <buddyq> well, I've bee trying different quotes..
[10:51:18] <Cryp71c> jedimind, he's escaping out of a larger php scope that you can't see here.
[10:51:37] <jedimind> thats my next line of questioning
[10:51:47] <Cryp71c> eg, his code actually looks like this (or something like it: echo " jQuery("#message .divMessage").html('<h2>Please wait while your site is being created!</h2><img src='"<?php echo $this->baseurl ?>"'/templates/"<?php echo $this->template;?>"/images/loading.gif\" />").parent().parent().overlay();"
[10:51:51] <jedimind> but this syntax alone is all over the place
[10:52:27] <Cryp71c> buddyq, more or less, you're not quite grasping how quotation works, either in javascript or php.
[10:52:50] <buddyq> okay im pasting a new snippet... I think the quotes are okay?
[10:53:21] <Cryp71c> buddyq, all programming languages (when dealing with quoted strings) behave in a simple manner (mostly): when a quotation is started, continue until another matching quote is found.
[10:53:22] <buddyq> http://pastebin.com/eMGetjRK
[10:53:59] <buddyq> can you tell me where I'm going wrong in that snippet?
[10:54:34] <Cryp71c> buddyq, is this in a .php file?
[10:54:40] <buddyq> i'm also trying to escape double quotations for the image src.
[10:55:00] <buddyq> yes but this is inside a javscript function which is outside of a php block.
[10:56:41] <mikl> I'm having a hard time figuring out how to stop forms from submitting when user uses the return key to do so. event.preventDefault() in $('#whatever form').submit() doesn't seem to work?
[10:56:52] <buddyq> see anything wrong with my snippet?
[10:57:26] <Cryp71c> mikl, onsubmit of the form, you could check event.keyCode == returnKey and return false.
[10:58:00] <Cryp71c> buddyq, you're over-quoting it. you don't need to escape the php code, it gets parsed out before the page is rendered.
[10:58:01] <Cryp71c> jQuery("#message .divMessage").html('<h2>Please wait while your site is being created!</h2><img src="<?php echo $this->baseurl ?>/templates/<?php echo $this->template;?>/images/loading.gif" />').parent().parent().overlay();
[10:58:33] <mikl> Cryp71c: returnKey? Isn't that a variable?
[10:58:49] <Cryp71c> mikl, psuedo code, go research the keyCode of the return key.
[10:59:02] <Cryp71c> and substitute that # in for "returnKey"
[10:59:10] <mikl> Cryp71c: ah, I see :)
[10:59:42] <Cryp71c> mikl, also, be aware that return and kp_return are not the same button, if you want to handle both, you need to code for it.
[11:00:09] <Cryp71c> kp_ is the keypad prefix (the number pad on the right of your keyboard)
[11:00:16] <mikl> Cryp71c: yes, thank you
[11:00:47] <rocklee> can anyone recommend something to me for autocomplete?
[11:01:04] <Cryp71c> rocklee, I'm not sure if you could be more vague.
[11:01:28] <Cryp71c> are you asking for a library which does client-side autocomplete?
[11:01:41] <rocklee> Cryp71c, I want to put a simple autocomplete feature on a page
[11:01:59] <Cryp71c> rocklee, jqueryUI has a reasonable autocomplete functionality.
[11:02:20] <rocklee> ok thank you
[11:02:51] <buddyq> Cryp71c: Thanks very much!
[11:03:20] <Cryp71c> buddyq, np, you should consider researching php templating, in-line php is aweful...abysmal...its...just terrible.
[11:05:12] <Vorspire> Cryp70c - couldn't agree more
[11:08:12] <hiryu_> hello
[11:08:57] <hiryu_> i can create 10 td on the fly without for? Like python's  'foo'*4
[11:09:06] <hiryu_> ops 10 ;)
[11:10:58] <key2> hi
[11:11:02] <key2> can someone give me a little tip on why that does not return anything ? http://pastebin.com/uKAQGzyQ    I must do something wrong with jquery
[11:11:35] <microhxo> I want to execute a click on a link with class t-link if it contains "First Name"  Here is my code: http://paste2.org/p/1903245  It's not working though.
[11:11:37] <loruk> key2: same origin policy
[11:11:44] <kborchers> ?ajax101 @ key2
[11:11:44] <bot-t> key2, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[11:12:06] <Cryp71c> hiryu_, no, you can't.
[11:12:22] <key2> kblake: thx
[11:12:25] <hiryu_> so i use for :>
[11:13:32] <microhxo> I am using Contains but its not finding the info.
[11:13:50] <loruk> microhxo: there's probably a much better selector
[11:14:04] <loruk> especially if you have control of the markup too
[11:15:24] <microhxo> Any suggestions?
[11:15:36] <microhxo> http://paste2.org/p/1903245 that is my current code
[11:17:04] <Cryp71c> microhxo, I've put in the HTMl that you've provided and tested it here locally. Works perfectly in chrome.
[11:17:10] <David_Bradbury> $('.t-link:contains(First Name)').trigger('click'); - First Name? Looks like two variables
[11:17:26] <David_Bradbury> Do you mean containers("First Name")?
[11:17:49] <Cryp71c> David_Bradbury, you dont need / want the quotes inside contains
[11:17:59] <Cryp71c> Not sure if they're allowed, but they're definitely not necessary.
[11:18:27] <microhxo> david, possibly. Let me trty.
[11:18:28] <microhxo> try*
[11:18:31] <Cryp71c> microhxo, If you're still having trouble getting this to work, rewrite a (much simpler) version of what you're trying to do. You've got a typo or simple mistake somewhere.
[11:18:46] <Cryp71c> The underlying functionality is there.
[11:18:49] <David_Bradbury> Oh derp, sorry I misread
[11:18:55] <David_Bradbury> My brain inserted quotes
[11:21:27] <microhxo> Cryp71c: its not working for me on either firefox OR chrome.
[11:22:05] <kborchers> microhxo: you definitely DO want the quotes in the contains selector ?see :contains
[11:22:13] <kborchers> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:22:27] <ircdearia> jqueryui 1.8.17 has draggable interaction, however, is there a 'rotateable' interaction?  I would like to click on an image and rotate it from either the center of the image or another specified anchor.  Has this been developed already?
[11:23:07] <key2> loruk: just read the slide, but what is the commun solution to bypass the Same origin Policy issue then ?
[11:23:12] <kborchers> second, triggering click on an anchor will not cause it to follow the href, it just fires the click handler
[11:23:48] <kborchers> key2: it is not same origin, well, it may be but your first problem is you're returning the var before your getJSON returns
[11:24:29] <loruk> key2: if you want to know more, check out http://alexsexton.com/?p=154
[11:24:31] <microhxo> Ahh
[11:24:49] <kborchers> key2: return data in your success callback rather than setting to a var then returning outside which won't work
[11:24:57] <microhxo> 	second, triggering click on an anchor will not cause it to follow the href, it just fires the click handler
[11:25:20] <microhxo> how can i make it as if i actually clicked it, to actually follow the href?
[11:27:25] <buddyq> How can I select ONLY the button that contains "deleteSlave" in the onlick? Here is what the generated code looks like: onclick="javascript:if(document.adminForm.boxchecked.value==0){alert('Please make a selection from the list to delete');}else{ hideMainMenu(); submitbutton('deleteSlave')}"
[11:27:56] <buddyq> the 'deleteSlave' is what i'm want to sniff for in submitbutton('deleteSlave')
[11:28:42] <fallenstorm> i have div object $('div.rate'). How can i find sib div with class name "rate_text"?
[11:28:59] <ravenzz> ?find @ fallenstorm
[11:28:59] <bot-t> fallenstorm, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[11:29:26] <fallenstorm> tnx
[11:29:36] <ravenzz> buddyq you can filter on the onclick attr content
[11:29:53] <buddyq> how?
[11:29:58] <LittleFoot> hi
[11:30:11] <LittleFoot> anyone here made embedable js widgets
[11:30:20] <buddyq> like a[onclick*="deleteSlave"]  ??
[11:31:04] <ravenzz> perhaps
[11:31:07] <ravenzz> try and see
[11:31:16] <buddyq> trying...
[11:31:42] <buddyq> cool! it worked
[11:32:02] <kborchers> that is just all kinds of gross!
[11:32:14] <fallenstorm> $('div.rate').find('rate_text') doesnt work
[11:32:31] <kborchers> fallenstorm: .rate_text
[11:33:01] <fallenstorm> oops
[11:33:02] <fallenstorm> =)
[11:33:18] <ravenzz> buddyq anyway i'd get rid of these horrible inline js
[11:33:29] <buddyq> cant.
[11:33:37] <buddyq> i'm not going to rewrite the cms
[11:33:45] <umren> what is best event to listen if i need to check state of "class"  on several elements?
[11:33:48] <ravenzz> k
[11:34:20] <LittleFoot> yeah so many ppl make inline js
[11:34:25] <LittleFoot> its so ugleh
[11:34:32] <LittleFoot> oogleh
[11:34:47] <LittleFoot> its usually not oop either
[11:35:27] <ravenzz> it is more about your mindset
[11:35:31] <ravenzz> :p
[11:35:46] <ravenzz> it is messy and dirty
[11:36:00] <LittleFoot> lol
[11:36:02] <ravenzz> those huge amounts of js and inline css
[11:36:14] <LittleFoot> its ok for websites
[11:36:20] <LittleFoot> lol
[11:36:25] <microhxo> Ok i just hacked it and did document.location.href = '?Grid-orderBy=FirstName-asc';
[11:36:58] <ravenzz> microhxo what were you trying to do?
[11:37:39] <microhxo> Now, a new problem i have. In JQUERY i want to be able to hide <th class="t-header" scope="col">  I tried $('.t-header').hide();  but that didnt work.
[11:38:31] <LittleFoot> that looks rite
[11:38:39] <LittleFoot> must be something else blocknig it
[11:38:53] <microhxo> damn
[11:39:07] <LittleFoot> ur order is messed up probly
[11:39:18] <LittleFoot> which is y inline crap is so bad
[11:39:34] <LittleFoot> always debug ur stuff w alert or something
[11:43:19] <mr3mpty> I have a question: if I deleted/updated usemap attr from img element, how can I redraw/refresh this image? (I used attr or removeAttr method).
[11:43:41] <LittleFoot> addAttr?
[11:44:34] <GothAlice> I have a custom object (var Channel = function(){ return true; }; var foo = new Channel();) that I want to create some custom events for.
[11:44:45] <GothAlice> $('selector').trigger() doesn't seem to be what I need.  :/
[11:44:52] <GothAlice> (Seeing as I have an object, not a DOM object.)
[11:45:54] <mr3mpty> LittleFoot: I will explain little more: in DOM attr value is ok, but browser is not reacting for new value.
[11:46:14] <Eviltwin> A DOM object?
[11:48:04] <GothAlice> Eviltwin: In my problem, the Channel object is not accessible via DOM selectors.  How can I trigger events on it?
[11:48:31] <Eviltwin> see ?.data
[11:48:32] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[11:48:39] <ajpiano> GothAlice: $(Channel)
[11:49:02] <GothAlice> I can jQuerify random objects?  O_o  Now I feel foolish for not having tried that first.  Sorry!  :D
[11:49:25] <ajpiano> some things act a little funky, and be wary of having event names that conflict with object methods
[11:49:59] <GothAlice> I noticed that, but having user-supplied events being able to prevent the default behaviour would be a desirable feature.
[11:50:22] * GothAlice is writing an NHPM-based pub/sub jQuery extension.
[11:50:40] <ircdearia> jqueryui's draggable interaction, when enabled, prevents firefox from creating that annoying duplicated image to drag into other applications.  How can I prevent firefox from doing that for other javascript mouse handling events?
[11:50:47] <Eviltwin> I prefer HIMYM-based pub/sub
[11:50:49] <ajpiano> https://gist.github.com/661855 GothAlice might be worth a look
[11:51:18] <GothAlice> ajpiano: Well, mine is server-based and multi-user, but that's quite handy, thanks!
[11:52:39] <Whirl3d> are there any simple jquery-based cms solutions worth investigating?
[11:52:59] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Well a CMS inherently requires a backend
[11:53:03] <Eviltwin> Which jQuery does not provide
[11:53:54] <Whirl3d> so, of the 30,100,000 results for jquery cms, you are suggesting that NONE of them is worth reading more about?
[11:53:55] <eddiemonge> unless you are using nodejs and the jquery port
[11:54:24] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: right. jQuery may be installed in some of the CMS's out there but it cant be a CMS on its own
[11:54:37] <Eviltwin> I'm saying they might use jQuery for some of the presentation but I wouldn't really consider them "jQuery-based" as they can't do the critical feature of a CMS
[11:54:40] <Eviltwin> Content management
[11:56:46] <Whirl3d> The thing about this channel that always seems to get me is the variable adherence to accurate word usage. Sometimes, people are caught up on the semantics of what someone asks (which is reasonable) and sometimes, they just let the semantics go and answer what they think the person meant. It's hard to determine which mode folks are in some times.
[11:57:06] <Whirl3d> I figured a php-BASED system that relies heavily on jquery for presentation.
[11:57:16] <Whirl3d> Sorry I was being lazy
[11:57:18] <Eviltwin> The problem is that semantics can be everything
[11:57:29] <Whirl3d> precisely. And nothing at the same time.
[11:57:51] <ajpiano> and expecting consistent behaviour from 900 strangers who are in different moods every day etc etc
[11:58:00] <Eviltwin> I've spent hours in here geting nowhere with their issue because their terminology was so off that I thought they were talking about something entirely different
[11:58:07] <Whirl3d> even more to the point, lol.
[11:58:12] <Eviltwin> In your case, you could have been talking about a CMS that relies on jQuery & node.js on the back end
[11:58:20] <Eviltwin> I've never heard of one but it's possible
[11:58:31] <Eviltwin> And it would be (at least) somewhat jQuery-based
[11:59:09] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: also fwiw, the idea that a cms that uses jquery heavily for the presentation layer being "a jQuery based CMS" is kind of like saying that a picnic in a field is a "cloth based meal"
[11:59:31] <Whirl3d> hmmm
[11:59:32] <Eviltwin> Nice analogy
[11:59:37] <Whirl3d> first of all, that was beautiful
[12:00:01] <ajpiano> :D
[12:00:04] <mr3mpty> LittleFoot: And even more: if I use .attr('usemap', 'somemap'); - it work perfectly but if I use again: .attr('usemap', 'othermap'); - it doesn't work.
[12:00:10] <Whirl3d> Maybe I need to get a handle on what I want a "CMS" to do for me. Perhaps it's not even a CMS for which I am searching...hmm
[12:00:17] <cfoo> Is there any way to update client content from backend without time refresh?
[12:00:47] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: a CMS that uses nothing but client-side javascript as a presentation layer is probably not a CMS that any sane person would want to use
[12:00:47] <LittleFoot> use the force neo
[12:00:48] <ajpiano> :\
[12:01:37] <eddiemonge> mr3mpty: try using .prop() instead
[12:01:45] <Eviltwin> Theoretically you could have a content-management API
[12:02:03] <Eviltwin> Where you're essentially pushing and pulling the relevant data from the server
[12:02:04] <eddiemonge> cfoo: you mean you have ajax pulling content on a setTimeout loop?
[12:02:09] <Eviltwin> And then using jQuery to draw it
[12:02:14] <Whirl3d> I am looking more for a system that acts as a front-end to very basic html development that users with no HTML could build some basic webpages...sounds a lot like wordpress, now doesn't it...
[12:02:15] <Eviltwin> I've actually done that before
[12:03:20] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: why not look at the other CMS options available that may be more user friendly than wordpress instead of trying to carve out a new wheel?
[12:03:45] <Whirl3d> That's why I am here...8)  Hoping you could point me in the right direction, sir.
[12:05:53] <cfoo> eddiemonge: No i only want to update div if "response.php" has changed
[12:06:33] <eddiemonge> cfoo: how would you know it changed?
[12:06:48] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: i like CMS Made Simple for simple CMS sites
[12:07:27] <cfoo> eddiemonge: My thought is to load the file every x second if it has changed ill reload the content
[12:07:55] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, thanks a ton. I will check it out now.
[12:08:00] <cfoo> eddiemonge: And compare it to the old
[12:08:20] <thefalling> $('input[name=data[request_sample][isDistributor]]').val() trying to get a radio button value doing this but its not working, getting undefined, worked for another page but its name had 'contact' instead of 'request_sample'. Is the underscore messing it up?
[12:08:25] <mr3mpty> eddiemonge: still same: new val in DOM tree, old one on the screen.
[12:08:46] <ajpiano> ?escaping @ thefalling
[12:08:46] <bot-t> thefalling, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[12:09:18] <thefalling> yeah didnt c it on the list
[12:09:25] <ajpiano> the brackets, dawg
[12:09:28] <ajpiano> the brackets
[12:09:34] <chee> bracketssss
[12:09:35] <thefalling> ohhhhhhh lol
[12:09:46] <thefalling> why did it work on another page that had brackets also
[12:09:54] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ mr3mpty
[12:09:55] <bot-t> mr3mpty, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:10:44] <thefalling> got a bad brain today, thx
[12:13:44] <tuibm> Hello all, i have this code on my site: var link = directory/diectory/directory/directory/image.jpg; --- WHERE "image.jpg" is a dinamic name (sometimes it has 6 chars, sometimes more or less) is anyway in jquery to remove that last word? (image.jpg) or wherever it takes?
[12:16:18] <tuibm> for more info: i have this: var link = (this.imageArray[this.activeImage][0]); and it produce directory1/diectory2/directory3/directory4/image.jpg i just want to have directory/diectory/directory/directory/ in that variable is it posiible?
[12:16:52] <eddiemonge> i forgot how bad #css was.
[12:16:59] <Eviltwin> tuibm: I'll give you the pieces you need
[12:17:14] <Eviltwin> tuibm: Look at JavaScript's lastIndexOf and substr/substring
[12:17:17] <Eviltwin> For the String object
[12:17:30] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: I had a friend who volunteered in there for like two days
[12:17:37] <Eviltwin> Everyone realized they could actually get help from him
[12:17:43] <Eviltwin> So he just got incredibly overloaded
[12:17:45] <Eviltwin> Had to leave
[12:18:07] <chee> my god #css is the worst place in the world
[12:18:26] <tuibm> lets see Eviltwin thanks
[12:18:32] <eddiemonge> i was giving some help right now and got flamed by riven
[12:18:39] <eddiemonge> for no fucking reason
[12:18:45] <chee> yes that's how he goes
[12:18:52] <Noeble> question: I wrote a jquery script that gets content via json and present it. It also populates a dropdown. When I click the dropdown, the population happens everything works.. but I get an annoying blink on load.. it blinks like 6 times fast at pageload. http://dpaste.com/702688/  . Problem seems to be at row64, if I remove that no blinking.. but its needed else it wont work. Anyone have an idea on what to do?
[12:19:06] <Whirl3d> They are so hateful. But who can blame them, css sucks.
[12:19:12] <chee> eddiemonge: seeing as i've seen them in there tearing people apart for advising reset/normalise.css
[12:19:30] <chee> eddiemonge: i came to understand that they are all insane
[12:19:59] <eddiemonge> Noeble: is id_game a multiselect?
[12:20:24] <Noeble> eddiemonge: no, just a normal dropdown
[12:21:01] <eddiemonge> Noeble: then select#id_game option:selected doesnt need a .each() since there should only be one
[12:21:11] <Whirl3d> Once again, at risk of sounding like a brown-noser, I have to say that the folks in here are so generous and patient all things considered. I, for one, am truly grateful.
[12:21:59] <Whirl3d> It almost reminds me of Ultrashock back in the day....
[12:22:33] <eddiemonge> Noeble: you should also not append in loops. get the strings/elements altogether and then do one append after
[12:23:20] <Noeble> eddiemonge: save in an array before append?
[12:23:44] <Noeble> eddiemonge: regarding the each.. how can I write that instead without it?
[12:26:20] <Chopps> hey guys, how can i get the id of an element with next() ?? on this example: http://jsfiddle.net/FBSMe/ i want to get the id of the element with the class ".mcc_dataparent", any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks
[12:28:47] <eddiemonge> Noeble: one minute
[12:28:59] <Noeble> eddiemonge: aight
[12:29:34] <eddiemonge> Chopps: .rpe doesnt have anything next to it
[12:33:36] <Chopps> eddiemonge: is there any way to find the id  of the element?? the thing is i have several elements with the class ".mcc_dataparent" but different ids
[12:35:24] <eddiemonge> Chopps: .attr("id")
[12:40:12] <Noeble> eddiemonge: how its going?
[12:44:31] <LittleFoot> y doesnt jquery have this $('#upload_form').reset();
[12:44:40] <GothAlice> How can I have a long-poll AJAX request that doesn't trigger the browsers "loading" spinner?
[12:44:45] <LittleFoot> and i have to do it manualy
[12:44:50] <GothAlice> E.g. http://push.site/chat.html doesn't spin, http://push.site/test.html does
[12:44:55] <GothAlice> Erâ€¦
[12:44:57] <GothAlice> Right, hosts file.
[12:45:18] <GothAlice> http://pushmodule.slact.net/ doesn't spin.  ;)
[12:47:11] <eddiemonge> Noeble: i didnt error check it and it still needs a bit of work but this should be slightly cleaner http://jsbin.com/utolov/edit#javascript
[12:49:30] <GothAlice> A ha, setTimeout(callAjax, 0)
[12:49:53] <eddiemonge> ?reset
[12:49:53] <bot-t> :reset: Selects all elements of type reset. http://api.jquery.com/reset-selector/
[12:50:42] <eddiemonge> LittleFoot: for what? you cant use the native .reset()?
[12:51:01] <LittleFoot> ok ill use that
[12:51:16] <LittleFoot> how do i switch to native
[12:51:25] <LittleFoot> from $('#upload_form').reset();
[12:51:47] <LittleFoot> i dont want to use document.getelemnt
[12:52:36] <eddiemonge> $('#upload_form')[0].reset()
[12:52:45] <LittleFoot> ooooh

[12:53:21] <LittleFoot> but i didnt kno u could do it like that
[12:53:24] <LittleFoot> thx
[12:54:08] <eddiemonge> LittleFoot: a jquery object of  jQuery wrapped DOM elements is an array-like collection of DOM elements. normal array methods apply
[12:55:10] <chaines51> I just find it amusing that it reads "Get at LittleFoot". So gangster

[13:04:22] <kanzie> every jsonp-request I make becomes a script-resource in chrome resource-pane, is this normal?
[13:04:36] <kanzie> feels like it doesnt clean up after itself
[13:06:47] <eddiemonge> kanzie: do you know what jsonp is?
[13:15:24] <kanzie> eddiemonge: I know indeed what it is and I assumed nothing but scripts.
[13:15:35] <kanzie> Problem is I have a baaaad memory leak and reaching for anything right now
[13:15:52] <kanzie> and the fact that it doesn't get removed from resources, might be the very indication I am looking for
[13:16:07] <kanzie> it seems all my data coming from jsonp ends up being detached DOM elements
[13:34:27] <mdpatrick> Anyone know of a half-decent tutorial that explains the fundamentals of the cool "infinite scrolling" (is this the right term?) trick that sites like interest do????
[13:35:15] <NoiseEee> mdpatrick: google "lazy loading"
[13:40:08] <h1ll37> I'm fading images when the image doesn't have a certtain class associated with it and it doesn't appear to be working. My code goes something like: $("img").not("."+group).fadeTo('slow','.56'); also tried without the "."+
[13:43:45] <Panoramix360> Hello
[13:43:50] <Panoramix360> I need some help with jquery
[13:44:01] <Panoramix360> someone who has advance knowledge?
[13:44:50] <NoiseEee> Panoramix360: just ask your question.
[13:45:10] <eddiemonge> ?lmgtfy infinite scroll @ mdpatrick
[13:45:11] <bot-t> mdpatrick, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=infinite+scroll
[13:45:20] <Panoramix360> Well
[13:45:24] <Panoramix360> I have a website
[13:45:32] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: what is grou
[13:45:34] <Panoramix360> that is divided by modules
[13:45:34] <eddiemonge> group
[13:45:41] <mdpatrick> Saw it. Was looking for a community vetted answer. Glad to see some consensus, even if snarky, thanks eddiemonge
[13:45:53] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: group is a variable being passed in
[13:46:32] <eddiemonge> mdpatrick: there are just so many that a question like that is a sure sign of not googling it. http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-create-an-infinite-scroll-web-gallery/
[13:47:08] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: a string? what doesnt work with the code?
[13:47:09] <Panoramix360> I have a website that is divided by modules and I create a navigation to it
[13:47:22] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: figured it out. case issue between php and jquery lol my fault
[13:47:23] <Panoramix360> I create to arrows to the left and the right
[13:47:31] <Panoramix360> and I need to navigate with this arrows
[13:47:34] <Panoramix360> in the modules
[13:47:39] <Panoramix360> I make a anchor animation
[13:47:58] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: let me stop you right there
[13:48:01] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ Panoramix360
[13:48:02] <bot-t> Panoramix360, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:48:31] <Panoramix360> interesting
[13:48:32] <Panoramix360> ty
[13:48:35] <Panoramix360> wait a sec
[13:48:43] <dogarrhea2_> so i'm using jstree
[13:48:56] <dogarrhea2_> and all it does is return -1 in the data funciton what is up with that
[13:49:01] <dogarrhea2_> and the docs are stupidly useless
[13:50:39] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I love jquery
[13:50:57] <Nicolas_Leonidas> just thought let u guys knoz
[13:50:59] <Panoramix360> is more easy if I give a link to my web site
[13:51:22] <Panoramix360> http://www.agencialego.com.br/clientes/teste54/
[13:51:30] <Panoramix360> see the arrows in the left and the right?
[13:51:32] <Panoramix360> click on the right
[13:51:46] <mdpatrick> eddiemonge: this is greatâ€¦ please, slander my name publicly but keep the links coming. mdpatrick is a bloody no googlin' fool!!!!!!!! hehe thnx mate :)
[13:51:52] <Panoramix360> but works only once
[13:52:12] <Panoramix360> I need this slide to work in the other modules too...
[13:53:08] <sphinxxx> anyone else use rackspace cloud files service (with akamai can)  ?
[13:53:43] <Panoramix360> anyone?
[13:53:59] <dogarrhea2_> http://www.jstree.com/documentation/json_data i am trying to figure what this guy means for passing json data.. the "data": "node_title" junk is really confusing and he's not clear at all
[13:54:24] <dogarrhea2_> i don't even know what the data should look like from the server. i am under the assumption it could just be any json parseable object
[13:54:55] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: you need some heavy image optimizations
[13:55:20] <Panoramix360> what do you mean?
[13:55:31] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: you also have an error in console
[13:55:46] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: i mean your site loads slow as heck because its download 2mb worth of images
[13:55:56] <mdpatrick> eddiemonge: Gave ya a little twitter/google plus stalk age. Hope you don't mind. :)
[13:56:10] <Panoramix360> ahhh yes
[13:56:11] <Panoramix360> I know...
[13:56:16] <Panoramix360> this is only a test
[13:56:27] <dogarrhea2_> god i hate open shit software. eating too much of my time figuring out what this guy is doing
[13:57:12] <Vorspire> that guy really could've just used cnsole.log - but ragequit works too I guess
[13:57:41] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: Well, you understand my problem?
[13:58:12] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: you should combine your scripts and this poor little guy $("button#fechar") has the click effed out of him. you have at least 4 click handlers for it
[13:59:12] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: thanks to advice meâ€¦I know how to fix this problemâ€¦but the other? you understand?
[14:00:41] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: not really. i like to have the obvious bugs fixed before i try to work on the harder ones
[14:00:54] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: okâ€¦wait a sec
[14:02:15] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: doneâ€¦i fix the bug
[14:02:58] <espressive> hey all
[14:06:47] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: i think you need to be updating the arrows href with the next section you want to go to
[14:07:22] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: yes, I know, but I don't have much knowledge to do this..
[14:08:20] <chee> is it some kind of holiday in australia
[14:08:51] <espressive> so, looking at .end(), I know this has been around for some time but, which of the following is the better option? no_end.js or with_end.js? https://gist.github.com/1820885
[14:08:56] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: perhaps you should read up on the plugins you are throwing on your page?
[14:09:28] <eddiemonge> espressive: i like end better
[14:09:49] <espressive> eddiemonge: is this personal preference or is there another reason?
[14:10:26] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: read up the jQuery and smoothscroll?
[14:12:36] <danzik17> espressive: it's really personal preference - there may be a "slight" perf difference without .end() since it's one less function call, but its so trivial that you don't really need to consider it.  personally, i'm the other way around - not a fan of .end()
[14:13:28] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: the ancher one
[14:14:22] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to register a click event to a bullet in an unordered list?
[14:14:28] <dogarrhea2> and only the bullet
[14:14:43] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: ah yeah. The small script...
[14:15:01] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: I try to use next(), but not successful..
[14:15:06] <espressive> danzik17: yeah, so I am thiking if it is because jQuery does not have to hunt for the initial element in the DOM as it is cached, no_end has the same effect. I am just trying to find a use case where end makes sense.
[14:15:43] <eddiemonge> espressive: toss up: http://jsperf.com/end-vs-no-end
[14:15:57] <espressive> thx eddiemonge
[14:15:57] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: you cant, not with the way your page is structured
[14:16:30] <Panoramix360> member:eddiemonge how I can structure better to use this? I think this is more easy to do..
[14:17:34] <danzik17> espressive: i use it sometimes when i want to work on intermediate results in a chain or something, but it's not worth storing in a var....this is a really contrived example, but http://jsfiddle.net/LdQg4/1/
[14:18:37] <danzik17> really my only argument against it is that i feel it forces extra indentation to keep the code readable.   there's nothing wrong with it otherwise imo, as long as you're not trying to do some ridiculous ultra-chain.
[14:18:59] <espressive> interesting thx danzik17
[14:22:36] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use chosen?
[14:22:55] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: ??
[14:23:54] <sphinxxx> if i have a "site" within a site (really its just within another folder),  should i set up analytics for each separately, or just for the parent?
[14:23:58] <eddiemonge> espressive: danzik17 http://jsperf.com/end-vs-no-end/2
[14:24:20] <eddiemonge> still mixed cases but where end is faster is faster by a lot whereas where it isnt faster its not by much
[14:25:00] <danzik17> eddiemonge: yea, so that's the use-case i mentioned - working on intermediate results that you don't want to store in a var.  i just mean if you're going to do a single operation ONE level down, just use your stored var and save an indentation level
[14:25:02] <espressive> eddiemonge: that is very interesting
[14:25:32] <danzik17> which *most* of the time is what im doing tbh
[14:27:00] <eddiemonge> danzik17: i dont mind indentation. i love plenty of white space. its my friend and should be your friend too
[14:27:31] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx: same or separate domains/subdomains? and slightly off topic by a lot
[14:27:41] <danzik17> eddiemonge: i dont mind indentation, but i mind needless indentation =P
[14:28:02] <espressive> eddiemonge: danzik17 I am finding no end faster every time
[14:28:04] <eddiemonge> danzik17: then do it on one line and dont indent ;(
[14:28:09] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: you don't know how to help me?
[14:28:25] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: i feel you have bit off more than you can chew
[14:28:28] <sphinxxx> same domain currently, but i probably should put the child folder on a subdomain
[14:28:37] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx: theres your answer
[14:28:45] <espressive> ah end wins this time
[14:28:50] <sphinxxx> eddiemonge: i'm here talking about jquery all the time,  not some random noob coming in here asking how to hack an xbox
[14:29:36] <espressive> nope seems end wins
[14:29:57] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge why do you feel this?
[14:31:51] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: there is a lot going on and im not sure about your level of jquery/javascript knowledge
[14:32:43] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx: i know. why you yelling at me, you answered your own question. same domain same account. subdomain different account
[14:33:03] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge it is not so good, but how I can study to do this?
[14:34:28] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: start smaller. learn jquery before you start using plugins so you understand how they work. read the api.jquery.com pages or go through jqfundamentals.com for some basics
[14:35:00] <rythmic> Hi is it possible to call a "global" function from inside a reqeust.done anonymous function (ajax request handler)
[14:36:13] <eddiemonge> ?tias @ rythmic
[14:36:13] <bot-t1> rythmic, Try It And See
[14:36:32] <Vorspire> that usually means yes :)
[14:36:50] <sphinxxx> eddiemonge: actually i just checked, you have one GA number even for subdomains
[14:36:52] <rythmic> bot-t1, I did and it didn't work for me which is really confusing
[14:36:52] <bot-t1> rythmic, Stored "I did and it didn't work for me which".
[14:36:56] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge okâ€¦ty! I will study moreâ€¦but you know how to do this?
[14:37:16] <Vorspire> ha
[14:37:18] <coldhead> lol bot-t1
[14:37:18] <bot-t1> function _(l){return l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))
[14:37:54] <Vorspire> ?I
[14:37:55] <bot-t1> Vorspire, Frequently Asked Questions - http://docs.jquery.com/FAQ#How_do_I_select_an_item_using_class_or_id.3F
[14:38:55] <Eviltwin> ?eval function _(l){return
[14:38:55] <rythmic> so there is no "clever" way to make that work?
[14:38:56] <Eviltwin> l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))
[14:38:57] <Eviltwin> Err
[14:38:59] <bot-t1> Eviltwin: SyntaxError: missing } after function body
[14:39:04] <Eviltwin> ?eval function _(l){return l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))
[14:39:05] <bot-t1> Eviltwin: "lol"
[14:39:30] <Eviltwin> rythmic: Have you ever called a function before?
[14:39:51] <rythmic> Eviltwin, of course?
[14:40:05] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: possibly. i could probably figure it out at some point
[14:40:50] <eddiemonge> rythmic: if its not working then dont ask if it does work, state your code doesnt work and provide a paste of the non-working code
[14:40:53] <sodapop> if i run .click(); on a disabled button is supposed to work ?
[14:40:57] <eddiemonge> ?paste @ rythmic
[14:41:11] <bot-t> rythmic, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:41:26] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge, if you can help me giving a start pointâ€¦ i need this a little fastâ€¦but if you don't have time it's okay...
[14:41:29] <eddiemonge> sodapop: no. its diabled.
[14:41:32] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use chosen?
[14:43:40] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: im not sure that plugin will help you since you need a callback to change the link href on click and adding another click handler on it may not be optimal incase one of them break
[14:43:50] <eddiemonge> coldhead is chosen
[14:44:14] <sodapop> eddiemonge, it works here
[14:44:26] <coldhead> ProLoser|Work: i use emacs and rent boys
[14:44:27] <sodapop> and is a jquery button()
[14:44:45] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx: https://skitch.com/etiger13/8begd/google-analytics
[14:45:04] <eddiemonge> sodapop: how are you disabling it? see ? demo
[14:45:04] <bot-t> sodapop, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:45:12] <sphinxxx> eddiemonge: thanks
[14:45:15] <sphinxxx> i got it
[14:45:23] <sodapop> .button({disabled:true});
[14:46:46] <rythmic> it's working now.. guess there was just some caching issue or some characters messed up.. very strange though since IDE found everything fine
[14:46:59] <eddiemonge> IDE's arent perfect
[14:47:56] <BinaryKitten> afterall they're just code written by someone
[14:48:37] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge, yesâ€¦but i need another plugin or i can make only with jquery?
[14:48:39] <rythmic> eddiemonge, no, but they're usually good at finding misspelled functions or whatever that was, anyway, thanks for your support :)
[14:51:40] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: you can do it without a plugin
[14:51:49] <eddiemonge> plugins are just more jquery
[14:53:17] <Panoramix360> eddiemonge: okayâ€¦like i said, if you know how to help me a littleâ€¦i will be graceful
[14:57:43] <eddiemonge> Panoramix360: maybe take a look at http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/36-eye-catching-jquery-navigation-menus/
[14:58:14] <tystr> css nav menus ftw :)
[14:59:29] <eddiemonge> not nav menus but sliding pages
[14:59:49] <Panoramix360> i will take a lookâ€¦wait a sec
[15:00:23] <Panoramix360> i will study this night
[15:00:29] <Panoramix360> thanks to help me
[15:00:43] <Panoramix360> I will back
[15:00:52] <Panoramix360> then I look for you
[15:00:53] <Panoramix360> Thanks again
[15:14:27] <sodapop> eddiemonge, it works only if unbind the click function
[15:15:30] <gaius65> Hi!
[15:15:49] <sodapop> if i just set it to disabled click function still works
[15:16:41] <gaius65> I'm using jquery and everything worked fine, but since two days the jquery file doesn't work anymore... any idea why? Maybe the server encoding changed?
[15:18:41] <adrian> is there a jquery function that can bind to a class changing?
[15:18:55] <Guest34678> like on this item getting a new class, do somehting.
[15:19:10] <Mkop> not that I know of
[15:19:16] <Guest34678> ok. thanks
[15:19:25] <Mkop> but there are lots of things I don't know
[15:19:39] <eddiemonge> sodapop: what version of jq/jqui?
[15:19:55] <eddiemonge> gaius65: what server/file are you loading?
[15:20:05] <sodapop> 1.7.1, 1.8.17
[15:20:15] <eddiemonge> Guest34678: i dont know of a way either
[15:20:32] <eddiemonge> Guest34678: normally you add the call to that function to the callback of whatever changes it
[15:20:34] <gaius65> eddiemonge: normal self-hosted jquery.js
[15:20:36] <David_Bradbury> I feel silly when I do $($(".className")[0])
[15:20:50] <Guest34678> yeah. i was using a plugin, and it seems the plugin doesn't have a callback
[15:20:53] <gaius65> eddiemonge: http://echtes-passives-einkommen.de/blog/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.7.1
[15:20:55] <Guest34678> was trying to avoid hacking the plugin
[15:21:07] <eddiemonge> gaius65: then if something changed, it was your server
[15:21:08] <Guest34678> http://mottie.github.com/visualNav/js/jquery.visualNav.js
[15:21:15] <GothAlice> https://gist.github.com/1821386 â€” Nginx HTTP Push Module (NHPM) channel management object and example chat application, includes Nginx server configuration.
[15:21:31] <gaius65> eddiemonge: any idea what is could be?
[15:21:41] <GothAlice> I'd appreciate feedback (on the Gist as I have to run now) on designing JavaScript/jQuery APIs, as this isn't something I normally do.  Thanks!
[15:22:11] <eddiemonge> gaius65: how do you know its not working?
[15:22:23] <eddiemonge> David_Bradbury: why would you do that?
[15:22:47] <gaius65> When I include it ain a page the console says: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier on line 6
[15:23:04] <David_Bradbury> When I'm iterating through a list of items that match a selection
[15:23:51] <eddiemonge> gaius65: line 6 of what?
[15:24:05] <eddiemonge> gaius65: id suggest you download the file from jquery.com because that one looks .... funny
[15:24:30] <eddiemonge> Guest34678: if the pluin doesnt offer a callback, id look for another one
[15:24:41] <Guest34678> thanks
[15:25:04] <key2> if I use 100 times the same <img/> with same source, is there a way that the browser doesnt try to do a GET everytime the image is needed ?
[15:25:21] <key2> basically is it possible to put it in an array for example and clone it everytime ?
[15:25:32] <eddiemonge> David_Bradbury: why would you get the dom element from a jquery object to put it back into a jquery object?
[15:25:58] <eddiemonge> key2: it should only do one request for the initial load and the load the rest from that
[15:26:19] <key2> eddiemonge: when it's static
[15:26:29] <David_Bradbury> So that I can use a method on that new jQuery object such as .hasClass
[15:26:29] <key2> eddiemonge: but what if I add the image dynamically
[15:26:35] <eddiemonge> key2: still same source
[15:26:47] <eddiemonge> David_Bradbury: just use it on that one. see ? eq
[15:26:47] <bot-t> David_Bradbury, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[15:27:00] <key2> eddiemonge: well yeah, I see that with the same src, it tries to get the image everytime
[15:27:35] <gaius65> eddiemonge: hmmm...ok, thx
[15:27:59] <David_Bradbury> eddiemonge: Fair enough, I wasn't aware of that method
[15:28:09] <David_Bradbury> Time to leave work though, later all!
[15:28:19] <sodapop> eddiemonge, what is the correct way of preventing repetitive submissions with the enter key e.g. a dialog with a button that submits with ajax, the button is bound to the enter key, so in the ajax i disable the button in beforeSend and then enable it in complete
[15:28:35] <key2> eddiemonge: when I do $("#somestuff").append('<img src=' + url + '>'); if the i do it 100 times with the same url, it will try 100 times to download it
[15:28:39] <eddiemonge> key2: then you need to set a far future expires for that request
[15:28:42] <key2> eddiemonge: have an aidea ?
[15:29:07] <eddiemonge> sodapop: that works, although if its a form element, i would disable the form
[15:29:34] <sodapop> ok ill try that
[15:30:03] <eddiemonge> key2: if you are doing that then you should cache the image reference. var $img = $('<img src=' + url + '>');  $("#somestuff").append( $img.clone() )
[15:31:26] <key2> mmh
[15:34:23] <eddiemonge> key2: loads once: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/ZjVFf/
[15:36:08] <eddiemonge> key2: one rquest: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/ZjVFf/1/
[15:36:09] <gaius65> eddiemonge: ok, thx
[15:36:12] <ProLoser|Work> is it possible to see if an event was namespaced?
[15:38:29] <eddiemonge> key2: lots of requests: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/ZjVFf/2/
[15:39:00] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: yeah, look at your code :D
[15:45:59] <maximus_> chat
[15:46:05] <maximus_> chat gui
[15:47:27] <Priapus> $(chat).attr('gui')
[15:47:55] <bung> can any regulars/experts maybe tell me why this code just feels ugly, maybe too much fanciful attempts at syntax or something http://pastebin.com/rNYYbcFq
[15:48:01] <bung> here is an actual sample http://jsfiddle.net/fbZDt/
[15:51:35] <bung> quiet today i guess :)
[15:57:27] <sphinxxx> bung: what is the problem?
[15:57:52] <eddiemonge> it feels ugly because it has a loop within a loop
[15:57:54] <bung> no problem, it works
[15:58:01] <bung> yea eddiemonge i think thats part of it
[15:58:36] <sphinxxx> what is your goal? just to replicate an accordion?
[15:58:36] <bung> im not sure if i like the ( ... ) ? ( ... ) : ( ... ) style either personally
[15:58:41] <bung> sphinxxx: yea
[15:59:09] <eddiemonge> i dont
[15:59:12] <bung> im not going to use jquery-ui here
[15:59:32] <eddiemonge> a normal if else works fine there
[16:00:30] <bung> alright well thanks for looking
[16:00:40] <sphinxxx> bung: here's a much simpler way to do it:  http://jsfiddle.net/fbZDt/5/
[16:00:42] <bung> i guess i was just nitpicking too much or something
[16:01:01] <eddiemonge> never use .size()
[16:01:06] <bung> sphinxxx: lol wow
[16:01:21] <jon_x> can someone tell me why this doesn't stop the link click? .. I'm being a little thick today.
[16:01:22] <jon_x> http://pastebin.com/tWQufxBk
[16:01:39] <bung> i dont think i should have .click on the entire pane, but i can work with this
[16:01:48] <bung> eddiemonge: its no good eh?
[16:02:10] <eddiemonge> bung: its completely utterly pointless. its an extra function call for absolutely no reason
[16:02:14] <sphinxxx> jon_x:  jsfiddle?
[16:02:18] <eddiemonge> all it does is return this.length
[16:02:26] <bung> heh, good to know
[16:03:07] <sphinxxx> bung:  or if you want it to be a tiny bit fancier: http://jsfiddle.net/fbZDt/7/
[16:03:19] <Priapus> people, dont abuse jquery
[16:03:24] <h1ll37> i have a script that sets up to where if i click something it displays a div. if you click that newly displayed div it needs to do somethign else but it won't work when i put the click function outside of the click function for the original occurance and it only works once if inside
[16:03:27] <bung> hehe
[16:04:06] <eddiemonge> jon_x: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/Wx6kw/
[16:04:21] <eddiemonge> wtf is itemprop. you should use data-itemprop
[16:04:47] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: are you creating the new shown div?
[16:05:19] <h1ll37> i'm creating the image that is triggering it yes
[16:05:50] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: should i leave an empty image in there and just set the source to what it needs to be? that way it's created from the start?
[16:05:53] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx: smooth except you have two issues. 1) you are creating two global variables, and 2) you dont event need the variable inside the click
[16:06:03] <bung> sphinxxx: im also not using css to hide panes because im anal about no-js
[16:06:07] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: you need the delegate part of see ? on
[16:06:07] <bot-t> h1ll37, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:06:33] <eddiemonge> bung: hide them with js then
[16:06:35] <bung> ill try with what you've done though, thanks again
[16:06:40] <sphinxxx> bung: you can do the whole thing with css too
[16:06:48] <bung> ie7?
[16:07:00] <bung> i guess i should look
[16:07:10] <sphinxxx> eddiemonge: the cached selectors aren't really global b/c they'd be inside the DOM ready event
[16:07:12] <eddiemonge> bung: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/fbZDt/8/
[16:07:31] <sphinxxx> eddiemonge: the $this is just habit,  in case you wanted to do other things with it, it's useful
[16:07:33] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx:  they are still global if you dont prefix with var
[16:07:52] <sphinxxx> eddiemonge: you're right
[16:07:56] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: is this preferred over .click() now?
[16:08:23] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: .click() and the other named handlers are just convenience functions that call .on()
[16:08:31] <eddiemonge> might as well go straight to the source
[16:08:56] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: well i'm looking at the doc right now but i'm fnfused to how i should od his including the first one?
[16:10:17] <jon_x> eddiemonge: seems to work in jsFiddler but when I use on my page it throws the dialog and follows the link at the same time
[16:10:46] <eddiemonge> jon_x: look at your console then. you have a js error somewhere
[16:11:19] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: use delegate then if you cant figure out .on()  (hint: the params for delegate are backwards from .on()  )
[16:14:53] <bung> ?eval function _(l){return l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))
[16:14:53] <bot-t> bung: "lol"
[16:15:02] <bung> heh
[16:15:08] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: in the api if a param has square brackets around it it's optional correct?
[16:15:38] <eddiemonge> yes
[16:16:05] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: well this isn't working: $(".big_pic img").on("click", function() { and i dunno why
[16:16:18] <eddiemonge> what version of jq are you using?
[16:16:24] <jon_x> eddiemonge:  works in explorer.. fails in firefox .  no errores in either :(
[16:16:41] <eddiemonge> jon_x: link?
[16:17:11] <jon_x> eddiemonge: can't link it... its a part of the administration of a site :(
[16:17:42] <eddiemonge> jon_x: what does chrome say? have you linted your code?
[16:18:03] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: uh not sure not too old though lol
[16:18:09] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: like a month old maybe
[16:19:03] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: needs to be jquery 1.7  or higher
[16:19:04] <jon_x> ediiemonge: chrome likes it as well.. something related to firefox
[16:19:53] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: it's 1.7
[16:20:48] <jon_x> eddiiemonge:  chrome and explorer work fine.  its related to firefox.  at last that got me going again.  thanks I'll take it from here.
[16:20:51] <eddiemonge> jon_x: like i said, theres most likely a js error you arent seeing
[16:21:03] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: how do you know its not working?
[16:22:26] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: well i have it where i had .click() earlier and it's not working at all now and .click() was. and i tried outside of the original .click() function that doesn't work either
[16:23:23] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: its pretty hard to troubleshoot vapor code see ? demo
[16:23:23] <bot-t> h1ll37, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:30:38] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: well here's the page: http://www.robotcasserole.org/testing/aconcept/members
[16:30:48] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: sorry it's so sloppy. rushed to finish this really quick
[16:31:30] <dogarrhea2> hrm
[16:31:39] <dogarrhea2> jsfiddle doesn't display unordered lists properly
[16:32:06] <eddiemonge> maybe it does and you are expeciting it not properly?
[16:33:00] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: is that a question or a statement :p cus with .click() set up the same way it works but only once
[16:33:27] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: that was at you. what am i looking at here?
[16:34:27] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: when you click one of the pictures all the small pictures are supposed to fade out and a bigger one come out. that's not the problem it's clicking on the big picture to get back the small ones
[16:36:18] <eddiemonge> this click: $(".body .text img").click(function() { ??
[16:37:07] <h1ll37> that works and yes that's the initial one that is required for the other one inside of it
[16:37:23] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: again, you needed to delegate it. like i originally said
[16:37:39] <eddiemonge> $(".big_pic").on("click", "img", function ....
[16:38:28] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: oh... why? but should i have that click inside or outside of the click function needed to hit this one?
[16:39:20] <eddiemonge> its fine where it is. you just need to delegate it.....
[16:39:28] <eddiemonge> wtf is all this: <script type="text/javascript">members[8] = "<br /><strong>Name:</stro...
[16:40:06] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: that's the sloppy part i was talking about lol. need to have this all done by wednesday and that was the fastest way to do it. I know it's awful
[16:40:14] <eddiemonge> your page needs a lot of cleanup. combine your scripts, use data- attributes
[16:40:20] <eddiemonge> itll make coding so much easier
[16:40:32] <eddiemonge> and faster
[16:40:38] <eddiemonge> and cleaner
[16:40:44] <eddiemonge> and give me less of a headache
[16:40:55] <eddiemonge> you also need to delegate the smaller images the same way
[16:41:05] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: what do you mean "use data attributes" and yeah sorry lol. but it still won't work when delegated
[16:41:23] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: wont' work more than once*
[16:41:24] <eddiemonge> ?data @ h1ll37

[16:43:56] <signpost> this selector doesn't work in ie8 ->  [data-attr_name=value]
[16:44:00] <signpost> does anyone know a work-around?
[16:44:15] <signpost> actually, simply doing [data-attr_name] doesn't work

[16:45:10] <Priapus> work-around, install chrome
[16:45:10] <eddiemonge> signpost: are you aware about escaping them? and why are you using data- as a selector?
[16:45:33] <signpost> Priapus: I'll tell my users...
[16:45:39] <signpost> :)
[16:45:51] <Priapus> they will be happy after a while
[16:46:09] <signpost> getting novice users to use a decent browser is not an option
[16:46:15] <Priapus> yeah i know
[16:46:37] <signpost> eddiemonge: as far as I am aware, you don't have to escape the attribute name in any way
[16:46:49] <signpost> I want to know which elements in a given snipped of html have the given attribute
[16:46:52] <signpost> seems reasonable
[16:47:09] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: just don't worry about it i'm in crunch time i'll leave that feature out for now. thank you though
[16:47:26] <signpost> I use that attribute to determine where in my UI the ajax html snippet ends up
[16:47:46] <signpost> I have an ajax call that updates multiple page elements
[16:49:01] <Priapus> i dont think this will fix it, but do you have the html5 doctype ?
[16:49:27] <tw2113> what's wrong with you if you don't
[16:49:46] <Priapus> at least the html is wrong if you use data- attributes
[16:49:50] <someprimetime> i'm loading content into a page with an endless scroll that i made, but for some reason each time i load new content and click on a button, that click fires the amount of times that the new content comes inâ€¦ e.g. : 1. i don't scroll down so no new content is loaded into the page and click on my button.. it fires once 2. i scroll down so new content is loaded into the page and click the button, it fires twice 3. i scroll down a
[16:49:50] <someprimetime> new content is loaded into the page again and click the button.. it fires three times
[16:50:20] <someprimetime> any idea what is causing this?
[16:51:21] <xboi209> Hey I'm looking at the :contains() page and here's the example: "$("div:contains('John')").css("text-decoration", "underline");"             The page says it will check text for all div tags containing "John" but how do I check in certain div tags?
[16:53:34] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: try this http://jsbin.com/uzigel/2/edit
[16:54:33] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: your event handler is in a place where it is repeatedly getting called
[16:58:04] <Tobsn> whats on("img") ?
[16:58:14] <Tobsn> erm "click", "img"
[17:23:19] <astropirate> Tobsn: on("img") is a mistake :S
[17:24:43] <dogarrhea2> has no method 'ready' in jsfiddle
[17:24:49] <dogarrhea2> on $(document)
[17:25:19] <dogarrhea2> woops
[17:25:27] <dogarrhea2> refreshed and now have poo tools
[17:26:30] <last1> I define a function called view_message() in my original jquery code. When the page runs, it outputs some <a href onclick="view_message") which are generated dynamically ( through ajax )
[17:26:50] <last1> the problem is that when I click on those links, it says: view_message is not defined
[17:27:38] <last1> how can it not be defined when I clearly define it in the original document ?
[17:29:38] <last1> this is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/YgFcv/
[17:32:23] <NightSparkle> last1: It's not defined in the context in which your onclick is executing here
[17:32:46] <last1> what do you mean ?
[17:39:43] <Tobsn> last1, http://jsfiddle.net/YgFcv/9/
[17:41:13] <last1> but I thought that .live/.on are necessary only when you bind events to newly created items
[17:41:26] <Tobsn> well, what are you doing with the html()
[17:41:35] <Tobsn> kinda newly creating an item, dont you? ;)
[17:41:46] <last1> yes, but I'm not newly creating a binding event
[17:41:55] <last1> in other words, I had no previous myid.click defined
[17:42:00] <Tobsn> no you newly creating a html element
[17:42:03] <Tobsn> hence the html()
[17:42:31] <last1> if I would have had: $("#myid").click ().. then I would have expected the click event not to work because myid didn't exist yet
[17:42:48] <last1> but in this case I am calling a function which already exists BEFORE the id is generated
[17:43:35] <last1> are you saying that as the new <a> elements gets created with onClick attached to it, that's basically meaningless ?
[17:43:48] <Tobsn> yep
[17:43:59] <Tobsn> because the script is already parsed
[17:44:09] <last1> aaaah
[17:44:14] <Tobsn> and when you create the html element onclick the onclick doesnt know what you mean
[17:44:32] <Tobsn> because the view_message() was already parsed and is "gone"
[17:44:34] <last1> so onclick becomes just another attribute
[17:44:41] <NightSparkle> your view_message function is being defined within your ready function
[17:44:55] <Tobsn> NightSparkle, even outside it wont know it
[17:44:57] <NightSparkle> The element sitting outside on the page doesn't know about it
[17:45:14] <NightSparkle> Tobsn: Yeah, I was expalining that it won't know about the function
[17:45:34] <last1> ok, but hang on a second
[17:45:55] <last1> the reason why I get an error is that onClick does actually get triggered
[17:46:01] <last1> so script is executed still
[17:46:05] <Tobsn> last1, http://jsfiddle.net/YgFcv/10/
[17:46:35] <Tobsn> yes, it gets triggered but it doesnt know about view_message because the javascript where you define view_message did already run
[17:46:39] <Tobsn> i think that is the reason
[17:47:07] <last1> why isn't it the same javascript ?
[17:47:49] <NightSparkle> because the function only exists while it's in the your function defined within your .ready callback
[17:47:52] <Priapus> if you put your original code in the <head> and the definition of the funcion outside the ready function it works
[17:48:59] <last1> ok, last question. any particular reason why you still use .live and not .on ?
[17:49:43] <Tobsn> another example
[17:49:43] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/YgFcv/11/
[17:49:46] <NightSparkle> You should probably use .on
[17:49:53] <Tobsn> because on() wouldnt work either
[17:49:54] <NightSparkle> If you're using the most recent version
[17:50:01] <Tobsn> at least doesnt with 1.7.1
[17:50:16] <NightSparkle> I didn't check what version you're on
[17:50:32] <NightSparkle> but you'll have to bind to the containing div
[17:50:44] <last1> why wouldn't .on work ?
[17:50:45] <NightSparkle> and then use a selector for your link
[17:50:53] <last1> I read that I shouldn't use .live anymore
[17:51:00] <Tobsn> well try it out
[17:51:04] <Tobsn> with 1.8.*
[17:52:14] <last1> $(".click").on('click',function(){
[17:52:17] <last1> doesn't work
[17:53:09] <Tobsn> ;)
[17:53:18] <Tobsn> its not like i havent tried
[17:53:47] <last1> but this works
[17:53:49] <last1> $("#mydiv").delegate("a.click", 'click',function(){
[17:55:02] <Tobsn> good
[17:55:04] <Tobsn> then use that
[17:56:16] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/YgFcv/14/
[17:56:17] <Tobsn> yep works
[17:57:17] <last1> why would they recommend you use .on() if it doesn't actually work ?
[17:57:28] <last1> they say to stop using .live and .delegate
[17:57:34] <last1> but .on doesn't even work properly
[17:57:58] <Tobsn> yeah idk
[17:59:34] <Tobsn> nah it works
[17:59:35] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/YgFcv/15/
[17:59:45] <Tobsn> just selector and event are switched
[17:59:51] <Tobsn> first event then selector
[18:00:43] <Tobsn> seems like if you add a element dynamically you have to provide a selector to the on() function so it knows where to look
[18:01:41] <Tobsn> hmm good to know that its depricated... gotta have to change up a lot of code now
[18:23:32] <fayimora> hey guys i have a list of comments and a reply button beside all of them, i want to be able to move the form beneath a reply when you click the reply beside it
[18:23:40] <fayimora> KNow where i can get tuts on this?
[18:24:31] <fayimora> Something like this http://davidwalsh.name/image-max-width
[18:31:04] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[18:31:06] <ProLoser|Work> i have a question
[18:31:33] <ProLoser|Work> i have a plugin that triggers the change event of an element, however I want it to also bind to the change event of the same element
[18:31:50] <ProLoser|Work> but it should only fire this callback when an external source triggers the event, so as to prevent a recursive loop
[18:32:05] <ProLoser|Work> i tried resorting to namespaces, but it didn't work how I had hoped
[18:32:36] <ProLoser|Work> i was hoping that when triggering a namespaced event, the non-namespaced event would ALSO get fired (such as change.mine & change)
[18:32:41] <ProLoser|Work> but alas, only the namespace is fired
[18:33:08] <ProLoser|Work> whatdo?
[18:36:01] <ProLoser|Work> can anyone help me?
[18:50:10] <felipevieira> how can I call a function (just one time) when scroll reaches the bottom of a div?
[18:50:44] <felipevieira> I'm using this code http://pastebin.com/Z5XXzG2m but it is calling the function lots of times
[18:51:40] <ProLoser|Work> put in an if statement
[18:54:00] <ProLoser|Work> is it possible to tell an event information about where it was called?
[18:54:08] <ProLoser|Work> i tried namespaces but this doesn't work because non-namespaced callbacks don't fire
[19:22:02] <dw> is there some method of finding the index of an element within its parent?
[19:22:08] <dw> currently using a nasty loop
[19:22:58] <webPragmatist> how can i profile a javascript file?
[19:23:08] <webPragmatist> i have some third party script that takes forever
[19:23:31] <webPragmatist> does chrome have anything/
[19:30:42] <intellilogic> I want to give my new function an alias, this will work just find:   $.fn.newdata = $.fn.nd = function(databit){  ??
[19:48:48] <last1> I'm getting some content in jquery using ajax. can I display that content in an iframe of some kind ?
[19:49:10] <Eviltwin> Sure, why not?
[19:50:14] <last1> ideally it would be something like fancybox
[19:50:30] <last1> the problem is that the content I'm getting is html code, and i need it rendered
[19:50:43] <last1> if I just load it up inside a <div>, it's going to cause problems
[19:50:54] <last1> so I need to generate a new page/window with it and display it
[19:52:38] <_Pepper> evening everyone.
[19:54:33] <_Pepper> Question: If I was to add 2 script tags with the same src attribute value in a document ( one in the head, and one if the bottom of the body ) would it be safe to say the the first time the browser encounters the script tag it downloads it, but the second time it just uses the cached version?
[19:55:49] <_Pepper> I know this is not a javascript channel persay, but it for a jQuery project and I am trying to leverage a script being in 2 locations head and body to leverage blocking and non-blocking behaviour in one swoop
[19:56:45] <_Pepper> Eviltwin: I so know you are egging to ask me "wth?" :P
[19:57:17] <Eviltwin> looopy: What is it a problem if you load it up in a <div>?
[19:57:19] <Eviltwin> Why*
[19:57:23] <Eviltwin> And that was for last1
[19:57:40] <looopy> o_O;
[19:57:46] <_Pepper> systemfault: any thoughts on the matter?
[19:59:14] <danzik171> _Pepper: curious, why load the file twice?
[20:01:19] <_Pepper> danzik171: trying to reduce the FOUC ( flash of unstyled content ) so the first occurance of the script I was running a small function to add some stylesheets , the second time in the body section, the script would then run the bulk of the commands
[20:02:03] <_Pepper> I could break it up into 2 files, but was hoping to leverage the cacheing behaviour of browsers to save some HTTP requests
[20:03:05] <danzik171> _Pepper: why not just include a CSS file with your initial style rules?  or just don't show the app body until doc ready?
[20:03:06] <_Pepper> The script also have a mechanism to prevent double firing so it know where it is being called from.
[20:04:42] <danzik171> _Pepper: i mean if you REALLY wanna do it that way, retrieve the script as a string and use jQuery.globalEval or something - that's how i'd do it
[20:05:28] <danzik171> getting a 304 depends on how your caching is set up - if you use the expires header, it might be ok - if you use last-modified or etag, it's still gonna make an extra round trip i'd imagine.
[20:06:19] <_Pepper> danzik171: intresting approach, on the globaleval, I will take a peak. And yes that is my fear as well with the headers.
[20:07:28] <_Pepper> my mockup is showing in Firefox that it is taking a round trip the first load, and refreshes are pulling from cache.
[20:09:58] <_Pepper> danzik171: I am interested to see if this approach is even feasible. It was a though over a few beers with another developer and we got curious of the behaviour.
[20:10:27] <danzik171> _Pepper: ah... lets just say the few beers might explain the idea =P
[20:11:10] <_Pepper> danzik171: lol, point taken, but hey it was a few beers that created jQuery so we can't mock the logic :P
[20:11:21] <_Pepper> or the approach :P
[20:15:19] <gr4yscal_> Is anyone in portland hiring?
[20:15:39] <last1> Eviltwin: so it's not a problem if within <div></div> I have <html><body>...</body></html> ?
[20:17:04] <Eviltwin> last1: see ?load(...,...,...) and how it works
[20:17:04] <bot-t> last1, .load(url, data, [complete]): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:17:20] <last1> I'm not gettint it from another page
[20:17:25] <last1> rather from ajax
[20:17:39] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[20:17:45] <last1> so I would be doing something like: $("#mydiv").innerHTML(mydata);
[20:17:45] <Eviltwin> Okay...
[20:18:06] <last1> and mydata contains stuff like: "<html><body>..."
[20:18:30] <last1> and I wasn't sure if it's ok to basically have those tags again
[20:18:34] <Eviltwin> There's also no .innerHTML function
[20:19:11] <last1> err, .html
[20:19:12] <last1> sorry
[20:20:04] <last1> so would that work ?
[20:20:17] <last1> or rather, is it acceptable ?
[20:29:05] <arthurdent> can I do like... $('html') or $('body') so i don't have to specify an id and have keyevents respond while being pressed anywhere on teh page?
[20:29:44] <arthurdent> would $(document) be correct?
[20:32:04] <arthurdent> 823 people and nobody wants to talk to me :(
[20:48:43] <donCams> hello
[20:50:26] <StevenCodes22> sup donCams
[20:50:32] <donCams> just fine
[20:51:04] <donCams> in-depth reading on javascript. have job interview with exam tomorrow.
[20:51:33] <StevenCodes22> donCams:  Very nice :)
[20:52:09] <donCams> not nice. i think they'll want me to learn flex and flash. i kinda hate as3 :)
[20:54:37] <hobs> dont worry everyone does
[20:54:53] <hobs> jobs are ass generally unless you are a very lucky man
[20:54:54] <astropirate> Anyone here create custom UI themes?
[21:00:07] <astropirate> for $$
[21:02:18] <skrite> hey all
[21:04:01] <StevenCodes22> sup skrite
[21:05:40] <skrite> i have a question about something with jquery.get(). .in the documentation, one of the settings is results, how do i use that? i am comming from prototype that looks like this... http://pastie.org/3378586
[21:05:54] <skrite> what i don't know is how to get the var sites =  out of the jquery
[21:09:41] <donCams> skrite: http://pastebin.com/7Y7jtmtJ
[21:12:10] <skrite> donCams: i get it, thank you very much
[21:25:12] <Whirl3d> athurdent, it works like this: People look at the questions, determine if it's something that is easily googled and if it is, most people just won't reply because if you haven't invested enough of your own time into googling the results, why should we invest any of our time in solving your problem?
[21:25:38] <Whirl3d> I can't talk for everyone, but that's how I look at it usually
[21:26:43] <Whirl3d> astropirate, when you say custom ui themes, you don't mean using Themeroller, I am guessing...
[21:26:56] <astropirate> Whirl3d: sure
[21:27:44] <Whirl3d> so are you asking if someone has tried making a buck at custom themes? or are you offering money for someone to create a custom theme for you?
[21:28:38] <astropirate> Whirl3d: both :)
[21:34:40] <b1lly> how do i make a $.post('blah.php', function(data) { return data; }); return the data to the parent or to a global variable
[21:34:54] <Cork> you don't
[21:35:05] <Cork> you can set the global variable, but you don't know when that happen
[21:35:05] <b1lly> ;/
[21:35:21] <Cork> ajax is async, and thats why
[21:35:31] <b1lly> so wats the solution
[21:35:40] <Cork> (you wouldn't want your page to hang while the network connection happens)
[21:36:02] <Cork> b1lly: either put your code in the success function
[21:36:05] <Cork> or use callbacks
[21:36:30] <b1lly> how do i use the callback
[21:36:48] <Cork> function my_function(result) { $.post(..., function(data) { result(data); }); }
[21:37:02] <Cork> my_function(function(data) {});
[21:37:39] <Cork> you could use defered if you like
[21:37:43] <Cork> but its basically the same
[21:37:49] <b1lly> you kindve lost me a little there
[21:37:58] <Cork> ok one min
[21:38:09] <b1lly> thx
[21:40:16] <phpdeveloperc> Hi, I made my second jquery plugin.. I was wondering .. it's probably useless but is there a shorter/optimize way of doing it or is it even safe. I don't know.. it has a specific purpose in my local development project so it might be useless outside of it .. https://github.com/hyperspaceuk/jQLoader
[21:40:27] <signpost> are there limitations to using $("<div>blah</div>") on ie7 and 8?
[21:40:44] <signpost> ah ha
[21:40:54] <signpost> it chokes on bad html
[21:41:00] * signpost disappears in a puff of logic
[21:41:10] <Cork> b1lly: http://jsfiddle.net/Cpred/
[21:43:36] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: uh.. thats actaully how getScript works
[21:43:44] <Cork> except it doesn't handle styles
[21:45:11] <jbpounders> Can someone please tell me why I'm getting a "function not defined" error http://pastebin.com/tWpJArGf
[21:45:18] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: but to answer your second question, i would be a bit carful about using things like that, as it makes quite a nice attackvektor for xss
[21:45:52] <Cork> jbpounders: use jsfiddle, and reproduce the problem
[21:45:58] <Cork> then ask
[21:47:42] <jbpounders> what does jsfiddle do exactly?
[21:47:43] <phpdeveloperc> I understand, is there an existing way of doing exactly what the script intends to do? It's mainly the the MVC to load scripts and styles as it's needed and define the functions within the external files that load the plugins
[21:47:58] <Cork> jbpounders: it lets you create live examples of your code
[21:48:10] <Cork> jbpounders: but i can tell you this much, the problem isn't on those lines
[21:48:22] <Cork> jbpounders: check your console for other errors
[21:49:08] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: in pages that work over the net, you normally don't want to do that
[21:49:11] <jbpounders> cork: Uncaught ReferenceError: login is not defined
[21:49:11] <jbpounders> (anonymous function)login:58
[21:49:11] <jbpounders> onclick
[21:49:43] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: the biggest cost and delay is doing the actual fetching of the files
[21:50:01] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: so normally you want to combind them into one big file, not split them up
[21:50:09] <ruby_on_tails> i have a function containing an animation with a callback function, now the parent function should return true after the animation completes, but if i put a return true; in the callback function it doesnt work
[21:50:22] <kjkj> kjl
[21:50:24] <kjkj> jklkjl
[21:50:43] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: then posibly have a small (2-4 lines) inline script at the top initializing it
[21:51:07] <Cork> that way the users cache will load the script file localy
[21:51:19] <Cork> and you will save much time on consecutive loads
[21:51:58] <Cork> jbpounders: are you defining login in $(document).ready or $(function() {}) ?
[21:52:17] <jbpounders> no
[21:52:29] <jbpounders> it's just on my login page...
[21:52:47] <Cork> ok, you need to do the reproduction of the error then
[21:53:05] <Cork> add relevant html, and js to a jsfiddle page to generate the error you see
[21:54:24] <jbpounders> I'll pm you the jsfiddle link
[21:55:36] <phpdeveloperc> Cork: I understand, I'm trying to avoid a large amount of data being loaded into one document, when most of it will be completely useless on pages that don't require it. Would it be better to have one large file of mostly irrelevant javascript or include an extra few javascript files? I understand that I don't want to load 100's it's mainly for a few plugins. The styles are mostly loaded...
[21:55:37] <phpdeveloperc> ...separately for each page in one document
[21:56:26] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: it MIGHT be worth separating it out into separat files if you have thousends of lines of js
[21:56:41] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: but if its just say 100-200 lines, no
[21:57:33] <phpdeveloperc> Alot of requests is bad but it's really only a few per page, page_name.css, page_name.js and a few plugins that the individual page requires. I think I will load all the css/javascript data into php, minimize/compress it if I can instead that would be better?
[21:57:35] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: the overhead of loading a file over http is quite significant' especially as all normal browser only do two connections to the server at a time
[21:57:48] <Cork> so ex. if you have two css files at the top
[21:58:02] <Cork> no script files will be loaded or even requested until those are loaded
[21:58:11] <signpost> k, so html5 tags aren't supported inside $(" ") in ie7 and ie8
[21:58:17] <signpost> even if you create them first
[21:58:22] <Cork> signpost: they are
[21:58:31] <signpost> Cork: nuh uh
[21:58:38] <Cork> you just have to tell old ie's that they exist
[21:58:41] <signpost> I did.
[21:58:47] <signpost> you can use them with other jquery stuff
[21:58:48] <signpost> but not that.
[21:58:54] <signpost> I'll bet a vital organ on it
[21:59:02] <Cork> your missing the point
[21:59:15] <signpost> I did document.createElement("section")
[21:59:16] <signpost> etc
[21:59:20] <signpost> they don't work in that.
[21:59:25] <signpost> even after doing so
[21:59:48] <Cork> ie <ie9 you want to do document.createElement('header');document.createElement('nav');document.createElement('section');document.createElement('article');document.createElement('aside');document.createElement('footer');
[21:59:55] <signpost> Cork: I did that
[21:59:58] <signpost> I'm not talking about selectors
[22:00:01] <Cork> the first thing you do when you load the page
[22:00:03] <signpost> I'm talking about creating new elements
[22:00:12] <signpost> I did that budâ€¦ come on...
[22:00:15] <Cork> when thats done, generating it through jquery works just fine
[22:00:22] <signpost> it really doesn't.
[22:00:32] <Cork> then your doing it wrong
[22:00:35] <Cork> works fine here
[22:01:01] <signpost> that's literally the first thing I do in my page.
[22:01:03] <phpdeveloperc> I will look into it further, see if I can use php to merge all the css into one, then all the js into one include per page, that's the result I want I guess
[22:01:22] <signpost> and I'm on jquery 1.6
[22:01:34] <Cork> phpdeveloperc: well at least keep them down to a few
[22:02:32] <jbpounders> Cork:http://jsfiddle.net/Svrnd/1/ this is what I have
[22:02:47] <signpost> Cork: jquery 1.6 bug
[22:02:51] <signpost> Cork: works in 1.7
[22:02:52] <signpost> sweet
[22:04:18] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/PcatJ/
[22:04:23] <Cork> wfm in ie8
[22:04:39] <signpost> eh, upgrading fixed my shit
[22:04:53] <signpost> might be relevant that I was using gratuitous data attributes
[22:04:56] <signpost> no idea, don't care now
[22:04:57] <signpost> hahaha
[22:07:14] <Eviltwin> Looks like at some point jQuery adopted this technique for cloning HTML5 elements in old IEs: http://www.iecss.com/shimprove/javascript/shimprove.1-0-1.js
[22:08:10] <Eviltwin> There's also a createSafeFragment function that does a document.createElement on all of those types
[22:10:23] <andrewjackson> is there people on right now?
[22:10:37] <signpost> Cork: check this out in ie8 http://jsfiddle.net/PcatJ/1/
[22:10:41] <signpost> it doesn't work for me.
[22:11:37] <andrewjackson> I want to load json through ajax as a script, so that I can get usable javascript functions through the json.
[22:11:48] <andrewjackson> is this already implemented, or do I need to role my own?
[22:11:59] <signpost> Cork: it works if you switch to jquery-1.7
[22:12:55] <andrewjackson> jsfiddle script seems to work just fine for me
[22:13:07] <andrewjackson> "hi i'm an and i'm here to show that i work just fine"
[22:13:44] <Cork> signpost: ah, i never add attributes inline in the object creators
[22:13:59] <andrewjackson> neither do I. =/
[22:14:01] <Cork> signpost: (or text normally)
[22:14:16] <signpost> lol
[22:14:19] <andrewjackson> also "$('body')" I use "$(document.body)"
[22:14:21] <Cork> andrewjackson: we'r talking ie8
[22:14:28] <andrewjackson> oh my bad. lol
[22:14:28] <signpost> regardless, there was a bug
[22:14:28] <Cork> and ya, its broken there
[22:14:30] <andrewjackson> I'll test there
[22:14:40] <signpost> fixed in 1.7 so it doesn't matter
[22:14:41] <Cork> signpost: true
[22:15:13] <andrewjackson> ya, it just doesn't work in compatibility more for 1.6
[22:16:10] <Cork> andrewjackson: html5 tags with attributes break in < 1.7 yes
[22:16:54] <andrewjackson> so what do you guys think I should use for getting usable js functions through json ajax?
[22:17:09] <andrewjackson> just set dataType as script?
[22:17:13] <Cork> you don't
[22:17:25] <Cork> you send it as script as its suppose to be
[22:17:39] <Cork> andrewjackson: you souldn't ever EVER send scripts in json
[22:17:51] <Cork> json is meant for data transfer
[22:17:52] <andrewjackson> why's that?
[22:17:55] <andrewjackson> hmm
[22:18:07] <Cork> cause json is meant to be a safe way to transfer data
[22:18:19] <Cork> it actaully activly removes scripts
[22:18:37] <signpost> I don't understand having all these rules for development
[22:18:38] <Cork> so the js (as its actually is) is static and not live
[22:18:38] <andrewjackson> my entire foundation is built upon adding/removing new javascript functions, and executing javascript from a server long poll
[22:18:40] <signpost> and I actively buck them
[22:18:54] <signpost> and write positively perverse code for fun and profit
[22:19:02] <Cork> signpost: you would have to fight a LOT to get scripts into json
[22:19:11] <signpost> I just send back html snippets
[22:19:16] <Cork> and the parsing rules go quite far to garantee they'r not there
[22:19:21] <signpost> and I cache them all on the server side
[22:19:25] <signpost> so they come out fast
[22:19:27] <Cork> thats fine
[22:19:35] <Cork> html doesn't garantee to be dead code
[22:19:35] <signpost> and I send like 3 at a time
[22:20:04] <andrewjackson> with what I'm developing, you have to think "botnet"
[22:20:39] <Cork> i'm not sure i get what you mean
[22:20:43] <andrewjackson> not exactly botnet, but the client needs to be able to accept organized javascript functions, and add it to it's own library
[22:20:50] <andrewjackson> basically...
[22:20:58] <Cork> thats js files
[22:21:01] <Cork> not json
[22:21:03] <andrewjackson> I should be able to control the client from the server
[22:21:22] <signpost> you know what I've been meaning to play with?
[22:21:25] <signpost> xmpp from the browser to the server
[22:21:33] <signpost> for a realtime app
[22:21:39] <andrewjackson> so I'll just use script as dataType then, right? even though my server output class sends json
[22:21:46] <signpost> bosh or whatever
[22:22:11] <Cork> andrewjackson: you use type script, and you send it as script functions yes
[22:22:35] <Cork> (function() { my_little_bubble_that_does_things })();
[22:22:40] <andrewjackson> so the whole point of the json dataType is so that it doesn't accept script?? lol
[22:22:59] <andrewjackson> they whole point of all that parsing?? lol
[22:23:03] <Cork> andrewjackson: no the hole point of json is that its FAST to parse for js
[22:23:14] <Cork> andrewjackson: but thats just javascript objects
[22:23:21] <andrewjackson> oh, that makes sense I guess
[22:23:24] <Cork> that was later standardiced to json
[22:23:36] <Cork> where functions and a hole lot of other things was removed
[22:23:50] <andrewjackson> so that means eval(json_text) is going to be slow?
[22:24:06] <Cork> yes, as it won't ever be jit compiled
[22:24:11] <Cork> and all modern browsers use that
[22:24:22] <Cork> eval will always be parsed each time its run
[22:24:27] <Cork> never compiled
[22:24:38] <andrewjackson> that's no good =/
[22:24:47] <Cork> ya :)
[22:24:56] <andrewjackson> back to drawing board lol
[22:25:56] <andrewjackson> okay...
[22:26:36] <andrewjackson> so I'll send json like this {"function name":['params...', 'params,,,', 'params,,,']}
[22:26:56] <andrewjackson> have it search for "function_name" and if it doesn't exist...
[22:27:25] <andrewjackson> create a new script element, and set src to retrieve the needed function through mvc type url
[22:27:43] <Cork> i would prob do it as [{"func":"", "params":""}
[22:27:43] <andrewjackson> so src could be... localhost/js/get/function_name
[22:28:14] <andrewjackson> ya, haven't really put too much though into the format yet
[22:28:18] <Cork> then you can just do $.each(data, function(i, call) { window[call.name](call.params); });
[22:28:28] <andrewjackson> actually, that's pretty good, thanks
[22:28:47] <Cork> s/.name/.func/
[22:44:02] <andrewjackson> okay...
[22:44:28] <andrewjackson> $('<script />').html(js_code); vs eval?
[22:44:33] <andrewjackson> good in theory, right?
[22:45:07] <Cork> ya, but then you could just have use $.getScript
[22:45:08] <astropirate> andrewjackson: yes
[22:45:11] <Cork> cause it does the same thing
[22:45:29] <andrewjackson> oh nice, already implemented =]
[22:48:05] <andrewjackson> should probably just test instead of asking, but does that mean if I simply delete/remove the script element and it's contents, then the previous functions from that code will get deleted?
[22:48:20] <Cork> no
[22:48:35] <Cork> tags is only there to load the script
[22:48:43] <Cork> after that it lose all connection to the code
[22:49:01] <andrewjackson> oh, well no big deal I guess
[22:49:31] <Cork> you can see it as, if burn a scaned paper, doesn't mean the img on your computer gets removed :)
[22:50:28] <andrewjackson> well, atleast my developer tools won't be overrun with script tags. lol
[23:00:03] <andrewjackson> actually, I've realized this is a very good way to hide javascript if I wanted to
[23:00:27] <andrewjackson> I could even require that the json be loaded first, before it will output the need functions
[23:00:54] <andrewjackson> so many new ideas from this, even though I really don't need it
[23:01:07] <andrewjackson> sneaky sneaky
[23:01:50] <Cork> andrewjackson: but still so eacy to break if you want to :)
[23:01:59] <andrewjackson> ya... I was just gonna say
[23:02:22] <andrewjackson> I'll never be able to comepletly hide the code, but I can make it a pain
[23:02:57] <andrewjackson> and in the process, if things don't go exactly to a specific protocol I setup atleast one time, I'll know exactly who's been tampering
[23:03:06] <Cork> andrewjackson: what i like the most is __defineGetter__
[23:03:17] <Cork> then you can fool page scripts just about how ever you want :)
[23:03:30] <Cork> and they have no real way to detect it ^^
[23:04:01] <andrewjackson> nice, this is new to me
[23:04:07] <andrewjackson> I'll research it some more
[23:14:51] <andrewjackson> getters/setters might be a nice way to go about my little problem
[23:15:15] <andrewjackson> for the getter, if it doesn't exist, I can just put the ajax code there and attempt to get it
[23:16:12] <andrewjackson> so many possibilities, I'm gonna need to plan this. I can already see myself wanting to do different things half way through
[23:19:42] <andrewjackson> it would be cool if I did something like var someDiv = new ElemObject({'attr':{'id':'divid'},'css':{css_json...}}); as a wrapper for jQuery functions
[23:19:58] <meghdad> yo how do i add a fn function?
[23:20:13] <andrewjackson> then I could add new html dom elements trhough json
[23:20:59] <andrewjackson> meghdad: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring this is a good read for that
[23:21:59] <meghdad> i use the regular syntax, but this code  return $.fn[this.jqueryui_object].apply(this.$input_picker, arguments); rasies an undefined error
[23:22:23] <meghdad> jqueryui_object is a string with the name of the fn function i defined
[23:23:25] <andrewjackson> and this.$input_picker is a jQuery object?
[23:23:37] <tystr> ((f.event.special[r.origType] || {}).handle || r.handler).apply is not a function
[23:23:43] <meghdad> yes it is
[23:23:48] <tystr> sigh...jquery error messages are useless...:/
[23:24:20] <andrewjackson> this.$input_picker[this.jqueryui_object](arguments) seems good in theory
[23:24:30] <meghdad> the code for input picker :    this.$input_picker = this.$element.find('input.oe_mappicker_container');
[23:25:22] <andrewjackson> when you do something like $.fn = function () { this.append('something'); } then...
[23:25:26] <meghdad> could be that the input picker is the source of error
[23:25:40] <andrewjackson> oops... that's... $.fn.something = function ....
[23:25:55] <meghdad> $element.find, how does it look for the element, where?
[23:26:11] <andrewjackson> then $(document.body).something(); gets "something" appended to it
[23:27:02] <andrewjackson> I believe it searches for the element under current context
[23:27:53] <andrewjackson> for example var somethings = $('.something'); will assign an array to of elements with the class of "something" to the variable "somethings"
[23:28:10] <andrewjackson> so if you do somethings.find('.else')....
[23:28:27] <andrewjackson> it will search every element in that array for elements with the class of "else"
[23:28:37] <tystr> why would removeContactInformation() be executing on page load instead of binding to the click event??     $(".delete-contact-information").click(removeContactInformation());
[23:29:07] <andrewjackson> documentation is a pretty good resource http://api.jquery.com/find/
[23:30:26] <andrewjackson> is there does your function look like "function { ... }();"? lol
[23:30:29] <andrewjackson> just a hunch
[23:31:42] <tystr> ?
[23:31:54] <andrewjackson> put console.log('removeContactInformation'); in your function
[23:32:01] <meghdad> andrewjackson, thank you, another q: what's the diff between using $.fn.extend({   and   $.fn.something=   ?
[23:32:13] <meghdad> both add a fn , right?
[23:32:28] <andrewjackson> extend can add more than one function
[23:32:45] <andrewjackson> it will take an object of functions, and add then all
[23:32:52] <meghdad> so, semantically both do the same
[23:33:10] <Eviltwin> Did you see http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring?
[23:33:13] <andrewjackson> not quite sure. extend seems kind of dangerous for a thing like that
[23:33:37] <meghdad> Eviltwin, yeah but didn't see the diff mentioned
[23:33:43] <Eviltwin> $.extend(a, b) is the same as going to each key k in b and doing a.k = b.k;
[23:33:47] <meghdad> though i just skimmed over
[23:33:50] <Eviltwin> If a and b are objects
[23:34:17] <Eviltwin> The other thing to do is see ?g ajpiano widget factory
[23:34:20] <bot-t> Eviltwin, jQuery UI Widget Factory - http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[23:34:36] <andrewjackson> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[23:34:36] <Eviltwin> For more sophisticated, primarily UI-oriented plugins
[23:35:02] <andrewjackson> extend takes a target though, so you would do something like...
[23:36:12] <andrewjackson> $.extend($.fn, {'func1': function () {}, 'func2':function(){}});
[23:36:37] <andrewjackson> or rather $.fn = $.extend({'func1': function () {}, 'func2':function(){}}, $.fn);
[23:36:52] <andrewjackson> think the second one is safer
[23:36:57] <Eviltwin> No, the first one is more correct
[23:37:02] <Eviltwin> And more efficient
[23:37:14] <Eviltwin> In fact I don't think the second will work properly
[23:37:34] <andrewjackson> well, more efficient, but not sure which is safer?
[23:37:45] <Eviltwin> But anyway, if you read the plugin authoring guide, you should know that ideally a plugin doesn't consume more than one $.fn
[23:38:06] <Eviltwin> Well what do you mean by "safer"?
[23:38:30] <andrewjackson> to prevent overwriting something
[23:38:50] <andrewjackson> never taken a look at the semantics of the $.fn
[23:39:10] <Eviltwin> Well in the first you're going to overwrite and in the second you're effectively trying to underwrite but it's not going to work
[23:39:28] <andrewjackson> oh lol
[23:39:43] <andrewjackson> I think I should study the jquery.js file before I give advice lol
[23:39:54] <andrewjackson> might be good for me
[23:40:03] <Eviltwin> Many plugins actually work by copying a jQuery built-in function and replacing it
[23:40:12] <Eviltwin> Then they use the built-in but also do their extra stuff
[23:40:48] <andrewjackson> I might incorporate that
[23:41:03] <andrewjackson> the concept I mean
[23:41:37] <Eviltwin> For example: var orig = $.fn.addClass; $.fn.addClass = function() { console.log("addClass", arguments); orig.apply(this, arguments); };
[23:41:51] <Eviltwin> addClass now still works but logs out the arguments that were passed in before doing so
[23:42:13] <andrewjackson> nice =D
[23:42:38] <Cork> you prob want to scope that though
[23:42:52] <Eviltwin> Yeah, although I consider that to be implied with plugins
[23:42:59] <Eviltwin> If you're not scoping your plugins, you'd doing it wrong
[23:43:05] <Cork> true :)
[23:43:38] <Eviltwin> Scoping meaning a ;(function($){...})(jQuery); wrapper around all of the plugin code
[23:44:10] <Cork> well actaully just (function() {})() is a scope
[23:44:20] <NihilistDandy> I never thought I'd like JavaScript, and then I found jQuery :D
[23:44:22] <tw2113> what's a great way for displaying errors on "required" parts of a plugin?
[23:44:22] <andrewjackson> oh yes, of course lol
[23:44:24] <Eviltwin> Scoping in a jQuery plugin
[23:44:25] <Cork> the other is a jquery "enviroment" enfoced scope
[23:44:27] <tw2113> alert? console.log?
[23:44:33] <tw2113> modal box?
[23:45:05] <andrewjackson> I never thought I'd like jQuery to be honest
[23:45:05] <Cork> tw2113: or inline text in the page
[23:45:14] <Cork> tw2113: i would avoide alert my self though
[23:45:18] <andrewjackson> I was always reinventing the wheel, that's what I "liked" to do
[23:45:22] <tw2113> ooh good point with the inline
[23:45:34] <Eviltwin> When I first saw jQuery, I basically thought "lazy asshole" about the guy who showed it to me
[23:45:45] <andrewjackson> lmao
[23:45:52] <NihilistDandy> I was iffy about it myself, but then I had a project that called for a crud grid and there was OpenJS-gridâ€¦ like a vision :D
[23:46:00] <Eviltwin> But now jQuery and I are almost inseparable
[23:46:43] <andrewjackson> I was always trying to make my own jQuery type frameworks with each new project, and always failing due to lack of planning
[23:46:47] <NihilistDandy> I still love Haskell for most things, but jQuery's finding a spot in my heart
[23:46:50] <andrewjackson> it was just never as good
[23:46:52] <Whirl3d> what about that crazy language you were developing in a week or two ago, Eviltwin?
[23:47:01] <Eviltwin> Oh, still have to
[23:47:02] <Eviltwin> OCaml
[23:47:05] <tw2113> cobol?
[23:47:09] <NihilistDandy> Ughâ€¦ Ocaml
[23:47:12] <Eviltwin> It's a functional programming language
[23:47:13] <tw2113> nah, no one uses cobol
[23:47:25] <Eviltwin> So it's sort of a mindfuck if you've never used one before
[23:47:31] <NihilistDandy> We have to use it in my programming languages class. Haskell's noisy cousin
[23:47:54] <Eviltwin> OCaml has no notion of a loop or mutable variables
[23:48:02] <Eviltwin> (Well I should say few mutable variables)
[23:48:04] <andrewjackson> wouldn't that be crazy if there was an OS designed to run on html/js? lol
[23:48:08] <Whirl3d> please tell me you are in college, NihilistDandy...
[23:48:20] <andrewjackson> not as simple as that as a concept
[23:48:50] <meghdad> andrewjackson, windows 8 programs are gonna be based on js
[23:49:02] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, if there's no looping? why?
[23:49:03] <andrewjackson> of course with it's own added objects like with window, and document, there was also system
[23:49:05] <NihilistDandy> Whirl3d: Yeah
[23:49:06] <Eviltwin> And that's part of why Windows 8 is likely to suck even more than Windows 7
[23:49:25] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Because it's designed to comply more with the mathematical notion of programming
[23:49:26] <andrewjackson> then you could have like remote desktop through a web browser lol
[23:49:28] <NihilistDandy> Eviltwin: It's all about recursion, yo
[23:49:32] <Eviltwin> With recurrences
[23:49:52] <NihilistDandy> Check out a mutuallyl recursive definition of is_even/is_odd
[23:49:56] <NihilistDandy> It's a thing of beauty
[23:49:56] <Whirl3d> actually sounds kind of cool.
[23:50:02] <NihilistDandy> *mutually
[23:50:14] <Eviltwin> NihilistDandy: I've had to write it before and I still think it's pretty silly
[23:50:26] <Eviltwin> When it could be done with one hardware instruction
[23:51:22] <NihilistDandy> For simple things, especially those that lend themselves to procedural solutions, I will be the first to agree that functional languages are silly
[23:51:31] <andrewjackson> I tried to learn C++ before, it was too complicated so I learned ASM instead lmao
[23:51:37] <NihilistDandy> But complex abstractions are much simpler
[23:51:43] <andrewjackson> well, started to =/
[23:51:45] <NihilistDandy> C++ is a nightmare
[23:51:50] <meghdad> Eviltwin, i've heard u could use various frameworks for win 8 programs. js being one of them
[23:51:55] <NihilistDandy> MIPS at least makes sense
[23:52:47] <fructose> I'm having a problem figuring out how to submit form data via $.get(). How would I take a form's .serializeArray() and convert that to JSON so that it can be passed as the $.get()'s data argument?
[23:53:09] <andrewjackson> so is win 8 gonna be like a scripting language OS or something?
[23:53:20] <NihilistDandy> lol
[23:53:34] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Here's OCaml for taking a list and building two out of it where the first has all the odd elements and the second has all the even ones: http://pastebin.com/xfdhBsGt
[23:53:37] <Cork> fructose: $.get('url', form.serialize());
[23:53:40] <NihilistDandy> Windows 8: Implemented entirely in regex
[23:53:46] <andrewjackson> cork beat me
[23:53:55] <Whirl3d> I thought it was gonna be flash based
[23:54:01] <andrewjackson> lmao
[23:54:21] <Whirl3d> all box-ey and roll-over-ey
[23:54:29] <andrewjackson> I miss macromedia =[
[23:55:15] <fructose> Cork, andrewjackson: I suppose I need to add a caveat then... I am also passing data with the form, e.g. {op: 'foo', id: bar}. I figured I would do a $.merge(), but that won't work with form.serialize()
[23:55:25] <Cork> andrewjackson: i don't miss there security hols
[23:55:29] <NihilistDandy> Eviltwin: Inria made some awful design decisions. My OCaml evangelist teacher makes remarks about expressiveness and type safety, but I blame the fact that the specification is based on the one implementation, rather than the other way around.
[23:55:31] <Eviltwin> fructose: Look at $.serializeArray
[23:55:50] <Cork> fructose: thats another metter
[23:56:02] <Cork> Eviltwin: that was his original question :)
[23:56:14] <fructose> Eviltwin: Yes, I mentioned it in the original question... I have the object, but getting it into the right format for a $.merge() is not coming easy to me
[23:56:22] <Cork> fructose: then ya you need to loop over the array and convert it to an object
[23:56:25] <Eviltwin> Why would you think I read your original question
[23:56:25] <andrewjackson> Cork: true, I was just starting out when Macromedia was still around, so I don't know much about that. but Adobe software just seems so inefficient
[23:56:28] <Eviltwin> I was deep in conversation
[23:56:40] <Cork> or use serializeObject see ?.serializeObject
[23:56:42] <bot-t> Cork, #11002 (Add serializeObject method to core) – jQuery Core - Bug ... - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11002
[23:56:47] <Cork> uh...
[23:56:53] <Cork> ?g jquery.serializeObject

[23:57:31] <Cork> andrewjackson: they are
[23:57:36] <meghdad> is making fun of ms the source of joy for ppl these days? curious
[23:57:54] <Cork> meghdad: they've kinda earnd it
[23:58:03] <Eviltwin> meghdad: You're talking in a room where it's the jQuery, JavaScript, and the browser 24/7
[23:58:11] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, it looks like some javascript notation that I never quite get...with implied comparisons acting as if-thens in really weird ways...
[23:58:22] <meghdad> ok Eviltwin
[23:58:22] <Eviltwin> And MS makes the one browser that absolutely refuses to use W3C standards
[23:58:26] <Eviltwin> So what do you think?
[23:58:29] <andrewjackson> I'm a MS fanboy. =
[23:58:31] <andrewjackson> =P
[23:58:35] <meghdad> just be cause of that?
[23:58:38] <fructose> Cork: Wouldn't I want to convert it to an array, not an object?
[23:58:41] <meghdad> they only make a browser right
[23:59:19] <andrewjackson> wait... what?
[23:59:31] <meghdad> and i have not throughly looked into it, but ie 9 seems to be pretty decent, no?
[23:59:32] <Eviltwin> They made the browser whose useage is a shade under 50% of the whole internet yet still won't comply to standards
[23:59:46] <Eviltwin> Decenter != Decent
