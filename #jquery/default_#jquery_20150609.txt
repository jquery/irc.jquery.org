[02:45:53] <wiherek> i really want it to
[02:48:57] <dimi1947> what syntax I must use if I want to check that a property is not true....that an element is not visible....is('visible') checks when it is visible....I am seeking code for when it is not
[02:54:17] <FilipNortic> dimi1947: visible is not realy a property... but what is wrong with just putting a ! infront of the is() block?
[02:55:03] <wiherek> anyway, can I use addEventListener to listen for jquery events?
[02:55:11] <dimi1947> You are right....I have not tested it...despite I have thought of it
[02:57:55] <dimi1947> FilipNortic, are you suggesting that  the checkmark goes in front of the is()....beacuse if this is what you suggested it does not work
[02:58:14] <FilipNortic> dimi1947: and hidden is the oposite of visible depending on what it is you want
[02:58:43] <Cork> wiherek: no, you can't
[02:58:51] <Cork> wiherek: those are fake events not real dom events
[02:59:37] <Cork> dimi1947: if(!$().is(':visible'))
[03:00:03] <FilipNortic> a missed that the : was missing
[03:00:48] <FilipNortic> there is a .not() method aswell, but i don't really like it
[03:01:40] <Cork> it doesn't work the same way as is though

[04:55:09] <unseensoul> If I try, var inputs = $('body').find('input'); and then, for instance, inputs[0].val(); I get "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function"
[04:55:31] <unseensoul> What am I doing wrong?
[04:55:33] <slax0r> is there any difference in performance when using a normal .on, or the delegated version?
[04:55:57] <Uhkis> unseensoul: you want inputs.get(0) instead of [0]
[04:56:22] <troop> Uhkis: http://104.238.167.124/ working example about validation engine
[04:57:13] <unseensoul> Uhkis: I still get the same error
[05:04:05] <FilipNortic> unseensoul: when you use get(0) you get the ordinary element not the jQuery version
[05:04:24] <FilipNortic> use .value instead of .val() or wrap it in another selector
[05:07:16] <unseensoul> FilipNortic: "Uncaught TypeError: string is not a function"
[05:08:46] <shoky> unseensoul: inputs.eq(0).val()  or .first().val()
[05:09:13] <shoky> (and if using .value don't call it as a function, it's a string)
[05:09:16] <Cork> or just .val()
[05:09:23] <Cork> as .val grabs the first element by default
[05:09:24] <shoky> er yup
[05:09:53] <FilipNortic> yes I was assuming he wanted to itterate
[05:10:39] <unseensoul> No, I don't want to iterate, but the funny this is if I console.log(inputs[0]) I will get the html
[05:10:59] <Cork> unseensoul: then inputs isn't a jquery object
[05:11:00] <shoky> you get the element. the console is being nice and displaying it as html
[05:11:09] <Cork> no
[05:11:20] <Cork> it displays the dom elements (in brackets)
[05:11:34] <Cork> so if you really get html, you aren't working with dom elements
[05:11:38] <unseensoul> Then how come, var inputs = $('body').find('input'); is returning me this sort of data
[05:11:50] <shoky> console.log(inputs[0]) would just show html, no?
[05:11:57] <unseensoul> Yes
[05:12:02] <unseensoul> In this case
[05:12:12] <shoky> inputs[0] is an element
[05:12:16] <Cork> it should give you pretty displayed dom elements
[05:12:16] <unseensoul> But I don't think it should.
[05:12:17] <shoky> inputs is a jquery object
[05:12:26] <Cork> not html
[05:12:27] <shoky> pretty displayed dom elements = html
[05:12:40] <Cork> no it isn't
[05:13:10] <Cork> unseensoul: can you expand the "tags" and navigate through the output?
[05:13:23] <Cork> or is it just a string
[05:13:31] <shoky> looks like html, didn't say it's just an html string
[05:15:14] <FilipNortic> well what is $('body').find('input')[0]; expected to return?
[05:15:23] <shoky> we're all talking about the same thing
[05:15:26] <troop> validation engine says: Ajax error: 200 parsererror and wont submit form
[05:15:35] <unseensoul> Cork, actually if I console.log(inputs), I get an array similar to [0,1,context, length,prevobject, selector, __proto__]
[05:15:39] <shoky> FilipNortic: an element
[05:16:27] <shoky> unseensoul: that's what a jquery object looks like in the console. sometimes
[05:17:10] <Macaveli> Euhm it seems that when I just add "$('#print_job').on 'click', (event) ->" the normall events of the action are disabled ?
[05:17:22] <Macaveli> is it possible to have more listerens on 1 action?
[05:18:44] <unseensoul> Anyways, shooky, you were right, inputs.eq(0).val(), works like a charm.
[05:19:28] <unseensoul> I just thought the bracket notation would also do the job
[05:19:33] <unseensoul> Thank you all
[05:29:43] <Kartagis> is this usage valid? ($) { ... }
[05:31:27] <shoky> no
[05:38:45] <phpcoder> hello everybody
[05:38:55] <phpcoder> someone use https://github.com/bootstrap-wysiwyg/bootstrap3-wysiwyg ?
[05:39:14] <phpcoder> i am not able to set the text dinamiccaly doing $('.textarea').html('text')
[05:39:28] <phpcoder> i see the text inside the hidden textarea (replaced by the editor)
[05:39:36] <phpcoder> someone could help me?
[05:40:19] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/215666/ shoky how about this?
[05:40:57] <Kartagis> phpcoder: does that field have the class textarea?
[05:42:02] <shoky> Kartagis: nope..  if you want the DOM ready thing.. $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[05:42:36] <phpcoder> Kartagis, yes because i do         $(".textarea").wysihtml5({     "size": "sm"     })
[05:42:40] <phpcoder> and i see the editor correctly
[05:42:50] <phpcoder> i am not able to set the text dinamically
[05:53:23] <Kartagis> shoky: how about http://paste.fedoraproject.org/230314/54382143 ?
[05:54:26] <Kartagis> shoky: setTimeout isn't doing its thing btw
[05:55:10] <shoky> Kartagis: uhm.. check line 3
[05:55:43] <Kartagis> doh
[06:01:05] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/215793/ <--- there. why isn't setTimeOut running?
[06:06:23] <shoky> Kartagis: you're using invalid code again
[06:06:50] <Kartagis> *sigh* what part?
[06:07:10] <shoky> line 2.
[06:10:14] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/215799/ better?
[06:11:02] <shoky> looks fine
[06:14:40] <Kartagis> shoky: setTimeout is still not working
[06:15:16] <shoky> Kartagis: works fine for me. reproduce your problem in a jsfiddle
[06:18:26] <Kartagis> shoky: that's what I hate the most. works find in the fiddle
[06:18:50] <Kartagis> fine*
[06:19:06] <shoky> or link to your site
[06:19:32] <shoky> also remember to check your console
[06:20:11] <Kartagis> shoky: http://dev.tubitekuz.com/proje/234 scroll to the bottom, fill in "tolga" in the first textfield
[06:22:58] <shoky> Kartagis: donno what i'm supposed to be seeing.. and where is that code
[06:23:16] <Kartagis> in tubitekuz.js
[06:23:29] <shoky> also you're getting errors that jQuery isn't defined
[06:23:41] <shoky> and indeed  jQuery===undefined
[06:24:17] <shoky> i don't see any tubitekuz.js
[06:25:06] <Kartagis> really weird. I don't see it either, though I'm seeing the behaviour in that js file
[06:32:29] <notchris> I can log something to the console, but I am unable to append it to the body?
[06:32:49] <notchris> Why can you log an array to the console but not append it to the body?
[06:33:48] <FilipNortic> notchris: an array of what?
[06:33:51] <shoky> notchris: because an array is javascript data, which the console is meant to display. the DOM, on the otherhand is for elements/html
[06:34:14] <notchris> So this works: console.log(arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]);
[06:34:28] <shoky> anyway if you just want to "log" it to body you can .append(JSON.stringify(thearray))
[06:34:34] <notchris> Which is really: var arr = [moment().format('MMMM'),dayNum,friendlyStatus];
[06:34:38] <notchris> But I cant do like...
[06:34:55] <Cork> notchris: .join('')
[06:34:56] <notchris> $(‘ul’).append(moment().format('MMMM'),dayNum,friendlyStatus);
[06:35:02] <notchris> Does not work
[06:35:09] <notchris> With the LI’s added in
[06:35:33] <Cork> $(ul).append($('<li>').html([moment().format('MMMM'),dayNum,friendlyStatus].join('')))
[06:36:09] <Cork> jquery can append an html string, or an array of elements
[06:36:12] <Cork> not an array of text
[06:36:35] <Macaveli> Hi Cork ! :)
[06:36:42] <Cork> o/
[06:36:43] <notchris> Cork: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[06:36:49] <Macaveli> https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/b82d30fc9d7fb121e85a if I put the alert after window push. this popup that is behind the Link_to works without the alert the popup (fancybox) does not open
[06:37:04] <Macaveli> it seems to be working now if I saw the alert for a return
[06:37:14] <Cork> notchris: you need to create a jsfiddle with the actual code
[06:37:22] <shoky> notchris: you probably copy-pasted fancy quotes from the irc client
[06:37:51] <Cork> Macaveli: never, ever, EVER use alert for debugging
[06:38:00] <Cork> Macaveli: use console.log()
[06:38:03] <Macaveli> alright :D
[06:38:17] <Cork> makes the browser do crazy things
[06:38:19] <notchris> Cork: http://rocketb.in/paste/8zMYvz
[06:38:24] <Cork> so you don't know how the code actually flows
[06:38:24] <notchris> shoky: I would know better
[06:38:42] <Cork> notchris: jsfiddle as in jsfiddle.net
[06:38:55] <notchris> Cork: It uses load and making a fiddle does not provide same result
[06:41:01] <shoky> notchris: you have an extra )
[06:41:36] <notchris> shoky: Still doesn’t work
[06:41:41] <notchris> $('.test').append('<li></li>').html([moment().format('MMMM'),dayNum,friendlyStatus].join(''));
[06:41:47] <notchris> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[06:41:52] <Cork> $(' <--
[06:42:11] <notchris> ?
[06:42:18] <Cork> you have crap in the code
[06:42:31] <Cork> none printable characters
[06:42:32] <notchris> I don’t know what ‘crap’ means
[06:42:39] <notchris> How do I make them printable
[06:42:53] <Cork> uh, you either use a decent editor that shows them
[06:43:00] <notchris> ..
[06:43:02] <Cork> or you just remove it
[06:43:04] <notchris> I use SublimeText
[06:43:18] <Cork> then i don't know what you're doing
[06:43:23] <Cork> it shows it here
[06:43:31] <Cork> (and marks it as invalid)
[06:43:45] <notchris> Which character?
[06:43:54] <notchris> That’s not specific.
[06:44:07] <Cork> $(--><--' this one
[06:51:28] <notchris> Weird
[06:51:32] <notchris> Still doesn’t work
[06:55:21] <FilipNortic> notchris: basicly all you have to check yourself is that the selector $() part works and that ayNum and
[06:55:34] <FilipNortic> firendlystatus are defined
[06:55:43] <notchris> They are
[06:55:48] <notchris> Because I can log them to my console
[06:58:18] <FilipNortic> notchris: and you're not getting any errors anymore?
[06:58:23] <notchris> Nope
[07:07:54] <yuradoc_> Hello
[07:08:36] <ufk> hello
[07:08:39] <yuradoc_> i have some jquery plugin for menu...i need to stop some events triggered
[07:09:00] <ufk> isn't this a valid syntax to find li elements inside a ul ? $('#cocktail_steps_ul li').each(function(){}) ?
[07:09:22] <Cork> ufk: it is
[07:09:32] <Cork> if '#cocktail_steps_ul' is an id of the ul
[07:09:45] <yuradoc_> i tried such thing but doesn't helped: $('#block-progressive-cms-menu nav .mega-group').children().andSelf().unbind().die();
[07:10:17] <Cork> yuradoc_: you have to check where the event handler is actually located
[07:10:55] <ufk> so why i get Uncaught TypeError: b.call is not a function
[07:11:19] <Cork> ufk: that isn't from that line
[07:11:22] <yuradoc_> indirectly yes
[07:11:36] <ufk> Cork: it's from jquery itslef, but this line initiates it
[07:11:41] <Cork> unless you have something extending/replacing the jquery .each function
[07:12:09] <yuradoc_> i use firebug, Cork
[07:12:29] <yuradoc_> but can't get right whoes trigger
[07:12:38] <Cork> yuradoc_: i doubt very much you have an event handler bound to ever element in the menu
[07:12:44] <Cork> cause that would be very slow
[07:12:54] <Cork> *every
[07:13:20] <Cork> ufk: then you have something modifying and breaking jquery
[07:13:46] <yuradoc_> it's open-source plug..and i want to unbind events for some elements that it trigger
[07:14:07] <yuradoc_> i know that it slow
[07:14:26] <yuradoc_> but i need at least to make it work somehow at least
[07:15:48] <Cork> ufk: http://jsfiddle.net/m420fbz4/
[07:16:04] <Cork> yuradoc_: events bubble in the dom
[07:16:18] <yuradoc_> i know
[07:16:27] <Cork> yuradoc_: so the plugin most likely have one event handler at the top of the menu listening for the events
[07:16:36] <Cork> not one for each elements
[07:16:40] <ufk> Cork: thanks. just noticed that i steped over the actual code inside that function, and a line in that function is causing the error. investigating
[07:17:03] <yuradoc_> possibly
[07:17:39] <Cork> youngnico: most likely, cause they would have to go out of there way to do it the other way
[07:19:58] <ufk> Cork: ok i had another each() in that function and i forgot to add the function statement inside that each. problem resolved. thanks a lot
[07:22:31] <Phibonacci> Hello. I'm loading 3 small datatbles but they appear buggy when they are not already loaded in cache. Is there an easy way to wait for datatables to load (assuming this is the only plausible reason) ?
[07:36:21] <notchris> This script is killing me
[07:45:55] <notchris> Wow
[07:46:02] <notchris> this is some bs
[07:51:46] <jamesdrawneek> Any idea why this https://jsfiddle.net/oxjLbozp/ seems to trigger >= 200 when scrollTop is negative?
[07:52:33] <aleray> hi, I'm trying to add a class to the html tag of a page in an iframe. It is on the same domain. I tried `$("#iframe").contents().find("html").addClass("prout");`
[07:52:41] <aleray> but it does not seem to have any effect
[07:53:42] <Cork> aleray: you can only do that if the content of the iframe is loaded from the same domain
[07:54:39] <aleray> Cork, yesthat is the case
[07:56:34] <aleray> Cork, in the web inspector of chromium I see no change
[07:57:02] <aleray> if I console.log($("#iframe").contents().find("html")) I can see an node
[07:57:40] <aleray> Cork, actually it works in firefox, but not in chromium
[08:01:28] <jamesdrawneek> or maybe not negative just seemingly random when at 0
[08:05:23] <aleray> Cork, solved: http://dpaste.com/1RRD7R9
[08:09:09] <dimi1947> I cannot find the syntax error regarding a bracket... https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/wpnakf9e/22/ open the console and see it
[08:11:08] <S-Work> using jquery's val() how do I set the value of an input to "&euro;" ?
[08:11:50] <S-Work> I now just get the entity itself in the input field instead of the eurosign, works fine when setting the value manually in the html
[08:17:41] <dimi1947> I fixed it
[08:22:22] <dimi1947> I am trying to make a conditional where will test if an input is disable(and it is) and then console.log...it does not work though, lines 31-33 https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/wpnakf9e/27/
[08:24:07] <dimi1947> I cannot understand why the test is not passed...there is an input disabled in the markup
[08:24:46] <kegster> dimi1947, i see why
[08:25:11] <kegster> dimi1947, your if statement--- if(($('input').is(':disabled')) ...
[08:25:15] <paule32> hello
[08:25:20] <kegster> it's only selecting the FIRST input, which is youir checkbox
[08:25:33] <kegster> you should use an ID for that element or something more specific.
[08:26:15] <kegster> dimi1947, do you see?
[08:26:32] <kegster> dimi1947, https://jsfiddle.net/wpnakf9e/28/
[08:26:48] <kegster> or something similar
[08:27:02] <kegster> i didn't check the rest of the code, but i know $('input') selects the FIRST input
[08:27:03] <kegster> :D
[08:27:11] <paule32> how can i get the index of an object?  i have following code:   idx = obj.indexOf(member);
[08:27:31] <paule32> but how to compare with special member?
[08:28:19] <kegster> special member?
[08:28:28] <kegster> oh the member
[08:28:30] <kegster> "member"
[08:28:32] <kegster> my bad haha
[08:29:01] <paule32> e.g: obj.subobj = new class();
[08:29:16] <kegster> i'm unsure :\
[08:29:38] <paule32> i want the name/string of subobj
[08:30:00] <paule32> with obj.constructor.name i get "class"
[08:30:07] <kegster> i found .index() but that may not help ya
[08:30:08] <paule32> but i want "subobj"
[08:30:28] <kegster> yeah i know im not sure :\
[08:31:03] <paule32> please query, i am afk for few minutes ,thx
[08:31:36] <robertmaxrees> as far as I know, you can't do that, but i'd ask in ##javascript - they might know.
[08:32:40] <robertmaxrees> though you should already have the name of the property - you're already accessing it.
[08:37:44] <dimi1947> yes i understand...I will do some testing as such
[08:39:23] <coetry> If i want to change the "src" value of a <video> tag, upon a click event, should I use $('#video-id').prop("src", "value") or .attr("src", "value")?
[08:39:33] <robertmaxrees> .attr() in this case.
[08:39:38] <coetry> ok thanks
[08:39:46] <coetry> whats the main difference? for clarification purposes
[08:39:55] <robertmaxrees> though either should work.
[08:40:09] <coetry> kinda confusing, i know that props allow you to set certain things that attr cant
[08:40:21] <robertmaxrees> .prop() accesses the underlying dom node.  .attr() acceses the markup - that's one way to think about it.
[08:40:28] <robertmaxrees> generally, you want to access the DOM, not markup.
[08:41:12] <coetry> hmm ok i see
[08:41:40] <robertmaxrees> (that oversimplifies it, but it helps me sleep at night ;) )
[08:47:33] <dimi1947> no that did not solve it....
[08:48:20] <dimi1947> despite I target a specific input....still the conditonal is not passed
[08:48:30] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[08:49:57] <dimi1947> I am trying to make a conditional where if an input is disabled console.log will be called...but I cannot.... the input of course is disabled.  https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/wpnakf9e/31/
[08:50:01] <dimi1947> line 31-33
[08:50:14] <kegster> dimi1947, something has to be up with your trigger. the input selector definately was an issue, albiet not the only one
[08:50:36] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 first off, no need to prepend the tag on IDs.
[08:51:15] <dimi1947> where exactly are you referring to it....?be more specific
[08:51:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[08:51:26] <robertmaxrees> input#till_mond_b
[08:51:37] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty specific as-is, but okay.
[08:52:00] <robertmaxrees> also you never actually initialize this view so it'll never run.
[08:52:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wpnakf9e/33/
[08:54:13] <dimi1947> what I was doing wrong....the view initialization?
[08:54:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[08:54:31] <robertmaxrees> you never actually initialized it so none of your code ever ran.
[08:54:50] <dimi1947> oh...it was so obvious and despite that I did not noticed it....
[08:55:34] <dimi1947> furthermore I did not quite understand your comment about prepending the tag
[08:57:11] <markholmes> dimi1947, you don't need input#till_mond_b because #till_mond_b is just as specific
[08:57:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:59:26] <dimi1947> oh...I got it
[09:04:26] <paule32> kegster: i am back
[09:05:13] <paule32> back to the problem
[09:05:46] <robertmaxrees> paule32 you're the person who wanted the name of the property from inside of it?
[09:06:07] <paule32> also the name of the object
[09:06:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah pretty sure you can't do that.
[09:06:21] <paule32> obj = test1();
[09:06:27] <robertmaxrees> but you should already have that information.
[09:06:35] <paule32> obj.obj1
[09:06:47] <paule32> i can do a for loop
[09:06:48] <paule32> yes
[09:06:57] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:07:00] <paule32> for (var member in obj)
[09:07:05] <robertmaxrees> you could also use Object.keys()
[09:07:09] <robertmaxrees> since for loops are gross.
[09:07:37] <paule32> Object.keys(obj) ?
[09:07:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:07:49] <paule32> and how to get the name?
[09:07:51] <robertmaxrees> that returns an array of properties on the object.
[09:08:07] <paule32> ah ok
[09:08:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jx49rLj7/
[09:09:35] <paule32> thx
[09:09:53] <paule32> the problem is, i have no names for the object
[09:10:00] <robertmaxrees> why do you need them?
[09:10:08] <paule32> the name should be build as obj.panel21
[09:10:15] <paule32> the name should be build as obj.panel21 = new Panel();
[09:10:27] <robertmaxrees> right, why do you think you need to do that?
[09:11:12] <paule32> because i can go over class oop programming and second the jquery: $(panel21).css ...
[09:11:34] <paule32> $('.panel21').css ...
[09:12:28] <hrusti> how to set onLoad handler when multiple elements are loaded? e.g. I want to invoke function when all iframe elements are loaded?
[09:13:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:13:11] <robertmaxrees> paule32 that doesn't make any sense.
[09:13:17] <paule32> i can do: for (var member in obj) alert(obj);
[09:13:38] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[09:13:43] <paule32> thsi will me display all member(s) in obj
[09:13:44] <robertmaxrees> for loops are gross.
[09:13:55] <paule32> so my first thinking was to use indexOf
[09:14:16] <robertmaxrees> what does $('.panel21').css() have to do with this?
[09:14:35] <paule32> also i want to build a framework
[09:14:39] <paule32> in this:
[09:14:46] <paule32> we = Application();
[09:14:54] <tricknology> hey all.  I am doing some JS Injection onto a page using jquery, I am very new to JQuery but I need to change a variable in a form.. There is an edittext box that I need to populate.  Any good intermediate/advanced tuts out htere?
[09:15:00] <paule32> we.panel21 = new Panel(we);
[09:15:13] <robertmaxrees> paule32 literally nothing you've said explains why you think you need to know object and property names.
[09:15:41] <robertmaxrees> hrusti you can check out the .load() handler, but it's questionable is its reliability
[09:15:42] <paule32> soi can use classical programming of jquery with new
[09:16:04] <robertmaxrees> paule32 then use it?  that doesn't require you to programmatically extract object names.
[09:16:17] <robertmaxrees> also I'd avoid doing classical oo with JS in the first place but to each their own.
[09:17:49] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: but I have to use flag? like var allFramesLoaded = false; $('iframe').load(function(){ if(allFramesLoaded) doSth() else allFramesLoaded=true }); ?
[09:17:58] <robertmaxrees> hrusti huh?
[09:19:32] <paule32> ah
[09:19:45] <paule32> your fiddle example works fine
[09:20:06] <paule32> it display's me all childs over parent
[09:20:33] <paule32> but how can i get the object name we.panel21
[09:20:39] <robertmaxrees> you cannot.
[09:20:47] <robertmaxrees> and that's irrelevant.
[09:21:34] <paule32> but i wanna be able to say: $('.panel21').css ...
[09:21:45] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with your earlier question?
[09:21:58] <robertmaxrees> you realize html classes and programming classes have nothing to do with one another, right?
[09:22:15] <paule32> yes
[09:22:21] <dimi1947> I have another issue regarding my conditional....
[09:22:43] <dimi1947> see line 30 https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/wpnakf9e/40/
[09:22:45] <robertmaxrees> paule32 then what does $('.panel21').css have to do with anything?
[09:22:52] <shoky> hrusti: you can use a counter/flag, or you can use deferreds and $.when
[09:23:27] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what's the issue here?
[09:23:29] <hrusti> shoky: aha ok
[09:23:40] <paule32> robertmaxrees: the panel21 key in your fiddle (my code)  and  $('.' + panel21) ..
[09:24:26] <dimi1947> I want to test if both there is an input disabled AND non-visible...in the markup one input is indeed non-visible and the other disabled....I am afraid though that the issue is with selector targeting
[09:24:29] <robertmaxrees> paule32 then you can do that?
[09:24:39] <shoky> hrusti: here's an example with deferreds  http://jsfiddle.net/nornx1xu/
[09:24:47] <paule32> your code works well, and it is very usefull
[09:25:09] <dimi1947> there is a reason I use a generic tag selector like "input"
[09:25:14] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wpnakf9e/41/
[09:25:16] <paule32> but it displays all keys from parent
[09:25:31] <paule32> but i only need obj.name (panel21)
[09:25:32] <robertmaxrees> paule32 and you can do things with each of those keys.
[09:25:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can't have that.  sorry!
[09:25:46] <hrusti> shoky: ty
[09:26:16] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 - you should check this out.
[09:26:21] <paule32> the problem i see: panel21 is not given/defined as string, not before we are declare it static
[09:26:43] <robertmaxrees> paule32 if you store that as a string somewhere, you can use it.
[09:26:57] <paule32> yes, but that the problem
[09:26:58] <robertmaxrees> but you cannot grab the name of an object from within it because the assumption is that you already have it.
[09:27:13] <paule32> i don't want store extra string
[09:27:17] <robertmaxrees> you don'
[09:27:21] <robertmaxrees> *you don't have a choice.
[09:27:40] <paule32> no possible to go over code?
[09:28:08] <robertmaxrees> paule32 as far as I understand it, you cannot get the name of an object/property from inside of it.  feel free to ask in ##javascript, but they'll likely tell you the same thing.
[09:28:25] <robertmaxrees> and even if it IS possible, it's a really strange design pattern that I'd highly suggest avoiding.
[09:29:04] <paule32> the solution is near
[09:29:16] <robertmaxrees> but it's not.
[09:29:18] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't exist.
[09:29:39] <paule32> your code shows me, that is possible, to get the names of class
[09:29:49] <robertmaxrees> *to get the name of properties on an object.
[09:29:59] <robertmaxrees> you can also get the name of the constructor of an object.
[09:30:00] <paule32> yes, right
[09:30:11] <paule32> yes, i know
[09:30:26] <robertmaxrees> then why are you ignoring me when i tell you that you cannot grab the name of an object from within itself?
[09:31:07] <paule32> maybe it is possible to set a flag:  var pClass = parent;
[09:31:08] <paule32> ?
[09:31:19] <paule32> and then iterate
[09:31:31] <paule32> hey, this makes me feeling good
[09:31:34] <robertmaxrees> if you want to somehow store the name manually, be my guest.
[09:31:47] <robertmaxrees> but it's a really strange design pattern that i'd reconsider.
[09:32:01] <paule32> ok, let me try
[09:32:18] <paule32> i am afk for a little time - dinner
[09:32:31] <paule32> thx for discussion
[09:35:19] <hydraidm801> i need to add a label some labels https://jsfiddle.net/qp7e1dfL/
[09:35:45] <robertmaxrees> var d = $("#id_start_date_1"); is your first problem.
[09:35:45] <shoky> ...dawg?
[09:36:08] <robertmaxrees> specifically, d.each(function(i) {}) wll only hit a single element.
[09:37:37] <shoky> hydraidm801: also, id's must be unique
[09:37:51] <robertmaxrees> that's why i pointed out those two things :)
[09:38:03] <shoky> yeap, just wanted to spell it out ;p
[09:38:06] <hydraidm801> yeah I can't have unique ids
[09:38:11] <robertmaxrees> then you can't use IDs.
[09:38:22] <robertmaxrees> since that's not valid.
[09:38:30] <hydraidm801> django does this marvolous thing with spliting date time objects
[09:38:30] <robertmaxrees> $('#anyThing'); will only ever match a single element.
[09:38:40] <hydraidm801> k so how do I get around it?
[09:38:45] <robertmaxrees> use classes instead.
[09:38:50] <hydraidm801> I cant
[09:38:55] <robertmaxrees> then you're SOL.
[09:39:04] <hydraidm801> I can't reference by name?
[09:39:16] <hydraidm801> or a different dom type?
[09:39:20] <hydraidm801> I have to use ids?
[09:39:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[09:39:27] <robertmaxrees> use classes.
[09:39:29] <hydraidm801> or classes?
[09:39:31] <hydraidm801> I can't
[09:39:37] <robertmaxrees> you CAN use attribute selectors, but last I checked names are supposed to be unique.
[09:39:42] <robertmaxrees> and that's gross and slow.
[09:40:51] <hydraidm801> well until SplitDateTimeFields get fixed I am stuck with multiple ids
[09:41:51] <robertmaxrees> doesn't django allow you to do your own templating?
[09:42:48] <hydraidm801> yeah but these are modelfields built from SQL tables. I don't actually write any of the HTML
[09:43:16] <pantsofchocolate> anyone know how to deal with this in the log? "Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated"
[09:43:37] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate don't disable async in your ajhax calls.
[09:44:04] <robertmaxrees> *ajax
[09:44:21] <pantsofchocolate> haha I dont tthink I actually do that ever, do you mean like set async to false?
[09:44:25] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[09:44:31] <robertmaxrees> that's what causes that error.
[09:44:40] <notchris> How do I append an array to a div? console.log(arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]);
[09:44:50] <notchris> The console argument works, but appending the items do not
[09:44:50] <robertmaxrees> .join() the array first.
[09:44:59] <robertmaxrees> arr.join('');
[09:46:10] <pantsofchocolate> robertmaxrees: yea i never set that in my code, searching it in the code its in the jquery and jquery.min.js
[09:46:11] <notchris> robertmaxrees: That worked, but now I have this
[09:46:27] <notchris> http://puu.sh/iiqEL/0917d1972f.png
[09:46:30] <notchris> In console....and
[09:46:39] <notchris> http://puu.sh/iiqFF/2e450b4003.png
[09:46:43] <notchris> In my div
[09:46:51] <robertmaxrees> right...
[09:46:57] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think you'd do?
[09:47:06] <robertmaxrees> ants jquery never sets that by default soooo
[09:47:10] <notchris> robertmaxrees: How can I make each one in a list?
[09:47:13] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate i mean/
[09:47:25] <robertmaxrees> notchris .join() joins each item of the array using a string.
[09:47:27] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs.
[09:47:46] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join
[09:48:25] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I see
[09:48:30] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Then why would this not work? $('#test').append('<li>'+arr.join('')+'</li>');
[09:48:38] <notchris> #test is a UL
[09:48:46] <robertmaxrees> ...
[09:48:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:48:57] <notchris> robertmaxrees: It’s not funny, I’m trying to learn
[09:48:59] <robertmaxrees> you're joining together everything in the array into a single string.
[09:49:11] <robertmaxrees> the docs are pretty clear imo.
[09:49:38] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oj81vzap/ for instance.
[09:50:02] <notchris> robertmaxrees: But append the joined array to a list item in a UL
[09:50:07] <notchris> It’s not working
[09:50:09] <robertmaxrees> to a single LI?
[09:50:16] <notchris> Each array item
[09:50:18] <notchris> To a new LI
[09:50:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to forEach() through the array then.
[09:50:35] <pantsofchocolate> robertmaxrees: nowhere in my code do we set async to false I just full searched it, it makes sense
[09:50:47] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate so then something else is setting it?
[09:51:51] <robertmaxrees> notchris http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oj81vzap/1/
[09:51:55] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this instead.
[09:52:27] <pantsofchocolate> yea thats what I am saying the only time i see it getting set either true or false is in jquery.js or jquery.min.js
[09:52:37] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate jquery doesn't set that value.
[09:52:39] <robertmaxrees> it only reads it.
[09:52:41] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Before I look at that
[09:52:45] <notchris> Did I come close? with..
[09:52:55] <notchris> http://puu.sh/iir3u/2c6472ee4c.png
[09:52:57] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate otherwise, there's a third party script causing you headaches
[09:53:06] <robertmaxrees> paste code, not screenshots :(
[09:53:15] <robertmaxrees> and sort of.
[09:53:17] <notchris> It appears to be both
[09:53:20] <notchris> :O
[09:53:22] <notchris> ;)
[09:53:29] <robertmaxrees> screenshots of code are bad, m'kay?
[09:53:33] <notchris> haha ok :P
[09:53:36] <notchris> robertmaxrees: <3
[09:53:43] <pantsofchocolate> robertmaxrees: yea blehhh, its weird this only happens in development and not production
[09:57:24] <pantsofchocolate> robertmaxrees: could that be an async call failing?
[10:02:01] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate nope.
[10:02:34] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate wait are you appending a script tag somewhere?
[10:07:48] <pantsofchocolate> well you were right it was a secondary problem
[10:07:48] <pantsofchocolate> less.min.js
[10:10:01] <unseensoul> Hi
[10:10:02] <unseensoul> I have this code https://jsfiddle.net/bj767r7d/ which works by creating a button with the text your entered on the textarea after each enter key. And when you click on those generated buttons it pops up the message you introduced. How does this work internally? How can a closure go fetch a value from a variable which was set in another closure call that has already finished loading?
[10:10:43] <robertmaxrees> unseensoul which values?
[10:10:44] <robertmaxrees> txt?
[10:10:52] <unseensoul> Yes
[10:10:59] <robertmaxrees> scope.
[10:11:03] <robertmaxrees> it's set in the parent function.
[10:12:53] <unseensoul> robertmaxrees: I know it is set in the parent function. But the outermost function is obviously reused.
[10:13:12] <robertmaxrees> it's not "reused" - its scope is available to "Child" functions.
[10:15:27] <unseensoul> robertmaxrees: I mean the closure attached to the keydown event
[10:15:38] <unseensoul> It feels like states are saved.
[10:15:44] <unseensoul> Or instances are created
[10:16:16] <unseensoul> Why don't I ever get the last value introduced then?
[10:16:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:17:09] <unseensoul> What didn't you understand?
[10:17:30] <robertmaxrees> what are you confused about?
[10:17:32] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty simple.
[10:17:47] <unseensoul> Not to me.
[10:17:51] <unseensoul> :P
[10:17:53] <robertmaxrees> let's walk through it.
[10:18:03] <robertmaxrees> you attach an anonymous function to the keydown event.
[10:19:36] <robertmaxrees> you check to see if the user hit "enter".  if not, abort.
[10:19:36] <unseensoul> Ok
[10:19:36] <robertmaxrees> if so, grab the text of the input and create a button.
[10:19:36] <robertmaxrees> bind a click event to that button that alerts the text.
[10:20:16] <unseensoul> Ok, wait now.
[10:21:02] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:22:01] <unseensoul> So when the button is clicked the closure/function isn't executed in the global scope, but within that one where it is defined?
[10:22:31] <unseensoul> Meaning javascript is keeping a state of everything?
[10:22:48] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:22:57] <robertmaxrees> that function is DEFINED in that scope.
[10:23:02] <robertmaxrees> not executed in that scope
[10:23:16] <robertmaxrees> the outer function's state isn't kept anywhere after it executes.
[10:23:23] <robertmaxrees> the inner function simply has a "copy" of that value.
[10:24:14] <unseensoul> So that function is going to be a copy to be executed sometime later?
[10:24:50] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:26:03] <unseensoul> If it's going to be a copy to be executed at a later stage, how can inherit a value outside a scope that finished when the onclick event was registered?
[10:26:12] <robertmaxrees> it's not inheriting.
[10:26:22] <robertmaxrees> and the scope didn't "finish".
[10:26:36] <robertmaxrees> the new object (in this case, a function) was created with that value.
[10:27:19] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go for training.  byeee.
[10:27:21] <unseensoul> You mean the closure?
[10:27:37] <unseensoul> Can you give me a good illustration about it?
[10:38:43] <MrPunkin> Is there a way that I can assign $(document).ready from within the body of the page? I need something to act as soon as the DOM is ready, as waiting until the page has loaded is flashing because it’s taking a bit too long. However, I don’t have access to edit the head of the page in this template system.
[10:45:22] <rainbrain> MrPunkin, https://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-document-ready-outside-head
[10:45:57] <arc_> this isn't my issue, but does anyone have any idea why this hover animation only works after you move the mouse cursor outside the window
[10:45:59] <arc_> http://bmax.io/dev/
[10:46:08] <arc_> the script is at the bottom of the html
[10:49:57] <rainbrain> arc_, it seems to be working for me
[10:51:26] <rainbrain> arc_, although it does resize the bar when i enter the window
[10:51:53] <rainbrain> arc_, it grows and then shrinks again real fast
[10:53:35] <decx> what a weird ass animation
[10:54:21] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/weveks9f/3/ if you go at line 31 you will see a console command for visibility...there are 2 inputs...one visibile..the other not...why I get true and not get false for example
[10:54:46] <dimi1947> why the visible input "prevails"?
[10:55:28] <dimi1947> why not get false?
[10:56:01] <dimi1947> I want to "go somewhere"
[10:58:05] <arc_> rainbrain if you keep the cursor inside the window and hit refresh
[10:58:16] <arc_> the hover animation will not work until you move the cursor outside the window
[10:58:53] <rainbrain> arc_, yeah i tried that, it still works :)
[10:58:59] <arc_> -_-; what browser
[10:59:15] <decx> why use js for this ?
[10:59:23] <rainbrain> chrome 43 on xubuntu 14.04
[10:59:42] <arc_> because he wants to prevent the hover animation from working until after the logo animation has completed
[10:59:49] <decx> so?
[10:59:57] <decx> add class hoverable on animationend
[11:00:09] <arc_> yeah that's not a bad idea
[11:00:12] <arc_> wouldn't have thought to do that
[11:00:21] <decx> crowdthinking works
[11:00:44] <arc_> we were going over it late last night but nobody else was around :p
[11:00:50] <arc_> DarkGhost try what decx said
[11:01:02] <decx> well it was weekend
[11:01:07] <arc_> ya
[11:01:09] <decx> wait... it's tuesday
[11:01:13] <arc_> lol
[11:01:16] <decx> where did monday go?
[11:01:32] <decx> great, i was obviously abducted by aliens
[11:02:13] <decx> my sphincter doesnt seem more loose than usual
[11:02:21] <arc_> D:
[11:04:00] <dimi1947> $('input').is(':visible') returns true or false....is there a way I can get which specific inputs are visible or not?
[11:04:31] <arthurvr> dimi1947: is $(‘input:visible’) what you need?
[11:04:39] <arthurvr> or am I totally misunderstanding you
[11:04:58] <decx> cache your collection of inputs
[11:05:06] <decx> filter you visibles in another var
[11:05:08] <dimi1947> give me a mn to test something...
[11:05:14] <decx> then you have a reference
[11:07:28] <dimi1947> I just want to get all the inputs in the DOM that are visible...
[11:08:16] <dimi1947> by ID for example...
[11:27:18] <cordovafan8> Hello. I'm trying to allow a scrollbar for a particular div in jqm 1.3.1/jq 1.9.1. The div has overflow: scroll on, and this works very well on the web, but not on mobile. Do I need to add additional css, or am I stuck installing a plugin
[11:27:22] <cordovafan8> ?*
[11:28:16] <lefoy> did you try on ios or android?
[11:28:22] <cordovafan8> android
[11:28:48] <cordovafan8> I first attempted with an iframe, but that seems to be a bad idea
[11:28:58] <lefoy> I've had issues with scrolling div on mobile before, didn't really find a clean way to achieve it
[11:30:57] <cordovafan8> lefoy: did you end up using a plugin?
[11:31:26] <cordovafan8> The scrolling part I can achieve easily (at least on cordova)
[11:31:45] <lefoy> I followed this post and it helped http://www.kylejlarson.com/blog/2011/fixed-elements-and-scrolling-divs-in-ios-5/
[11:31:45] <cordovafan8> but having a scrollbar is turning out to be unexpectedly challenging
[11:32:01] <lefoy> I think the key is -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
[11:32:26] <lefoy> if you really have no luck getting it working on mobile, you could try this javascript plugin http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[11:32:42] <lefoy> I've use jscrollpane few times before and it works great
[11:33:22] <cordovafan8> isn't that css element just to enable the scrolling?
[11:33:44] <cordovafan8> I've already given it a shot a few times, but I may have done it incorrectly
[11:35:13] <lefoy> are you able to scroll inside your div on mobile if you use two fingers?
[11:36:42] <lefoy> do you have live demo?
[11:37:16] <cordovafan8> lefoy: I can scroll with one or two fingers.
[11:37:26] <cordovafan8> no I don't have a live demo sorry
[11:37:52] <lefoy> hum not sure I understand your issue if you're able to scroll with one finger
[11:37:56] <cordovafan8> I may try out the plugin you recommended, I'm just loath to add any more
[11:37:57] <lefoy> what doesn't work exactly?
[11:38:07] <cordovafan8> I need a scrollbar
[11:38:17] <cordovafan8> scrolling the div works fine in all cases I've tested so far
[11:38:35] <lefoy> ahh, I thought you said it doesn't scroll on mobile, my bad
[11:38:37] <cordovafan8> but there is no scrollbar displayed because... mobile
[11:38:48] <cordovafan8> no worries :)
[11:39:09] <cordovafan8> it's a common enough problem.. pretty surprising tbh
[11:39:46] <lefoy> well there's a way for webkit browser, but for other browser you'll need a javascript solution
[11:40:38] <lefoy> did you try this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22907777/make-scrollbar-visible-in-mobile-browsers
[11:42:39] <popl> Hello everyone. Here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/pp47h9Lc/
[11:42:49] <popl> I'm trying to get that working on IE, Chrome, and FIrefox.
[11:43:02] <__bnp> for some reason my site is loading janky please help me
[11:43:27] <NoiseEee> popl: $('#someForm').on('submit',function() { //etc })
[11:43:36] <__bnp> I'm appending about ~500 rows to a table all with an image
[11:43:36] <popl> ah, here you are
[11:43:38] <popl> NoiseEee: Why?
[11:43:39] <NoiseEee> popl: you should be using the 'on' method of observing for events
[11:43:45] <__bnp> just at $(window).load
[11:43:49] <cordovafan8> lefoy: no I didn't try that yet, because I will need iOS support as well
[11:43:53] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/on/ @ popl
[11:43:57] <cordovafan8> thanks for the suggestion though
[11:44:03] <decx> only show those that are on screen __bnp
[11:44:03] <cordovafan8> I'm giving the scrollpane plugin a shot
[11:44:05] <popl> thank you
[11:44:06] <randomguy1> popl: also you might use the prop instead of  the attr function: $(this).prop('disabled', true);
[11:44:30] <lefoy> cordovafan8 if you want a truly cross browser solution, you'll need to use javascript unfortunately.. :\
[11:44:34] <__bnp> decx: sorry?
[11:44:57] <decx> there's a neat script that will replace table cells as you scroll
[11:45:03] <decx> this will make your site snappy
[11:45:05] <popl> yeah I already used prop and went back to attr randomguy1
[11:45:07] <popl> thanks
[11:45:27] <lefoy> gotta go, you guys take care
[11:46:03] <cordovafan8> thanks for the help lefoy
[11:46:09] <cordovafan8> oops, missed him
[11:46:57] <popl> NoiseEee: presumably I'd also use $('#button').on('click', function() { ... }); as well?
[11:48:13] <randomguy1> popl: yep
[11:48:16] <popl> http://api.jquery.com/submit/ # says that .submit( handler ) is short form for .on( 'submit', handler)
[11:49:47] <NoiseEee> popl: in general 'on' is preferred / best practices
[11:50:00] <NoiseEee> popl: when you say 'not working in chrome' though, what specifically do you mean?
[11:50:23] <popl> NoiseEee: The submit handler is never called.
[11:50:56] <popl> at least according to the Chrome JS console and my QA guy.
[11:51:09] <popl> s/my/the/
[11:52:16] <popl> incidentally, is there a reason it is considered best practice to use the long-form of the event handler?
[11:52:57] <randomguy1> i'd imagine because it is one step away from being able to use the delegate version
[11:53:45] <popl> my first thought was that it'd be easy to automate generation of different types of event handlers with the long-form syntax.
[11:53:51] <randomguy1> and if everyone used .on you could eventually remove the wrapper code
[11:53:54] <popl> but also that it probably wasn't the reason it is best practice
[11:53:57] <NoiseEee> popl: your issue is because you set the attribute to disabled by the way
[11:54:21] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/pp47h9Lc/1/ @ popl
[11:54:48] <NoiseEee> popl: presumably you'd want to disable that button when the form itself is submitted, so move that stuff to the form submission
[11:55:33] <popl> Initially I only had the submission handler but the button wasn't being disabled when it was called.
[11:56:14] <NoiseEee> popl: http://jsfiddle.net/pp47h9Lc/2/
[12:01:58] <popl> NoiseEee: does e.preventDefault() prevent the form from being submitted?
[12:02:06] <NoiseEee> popl: yes
[12:02:46] <popl> This is frustrating. :)
[12:02:58] <popl> NoiseEee: I really appreciate your help.
[12:03:15] <NoiseEee> np popl good luck!
[12:03:22] <popl> The next time I see a JS bug in the issue tracker I'm going to leave it alone. :P
[12:03:34] <popl> Yeah, I need to figure out how to do this and submit the form too.
[12:03:42] <popl> So this is a learning experience for sure.
[12:04:19] <NoiseEee> i just added that because I assumed you wanted to do some sort of logic before allowing the form to be submitted;  if not, just remove the preventDefault and stopPropagation stuff popl
[12:05:28] <popl> Yeah, I should've done that before mentioning it. Thanks.
[12:06:49] <popl> I'm still curious as to why my original thing worked in Firefox and IE but not Chrome.
[12:07:37] <popl> randomguy1: thanks for your help as well
[12:07:43] <popl> almost forgot
[12:07:57] <popl> Everybody forgets the random guy, eh?
[12:08:00] <popl> ;)
[12:08:44] <randomguy1> can't be helped
[12:08:58] <popl> like tears in rain
[12:19:22] <Wes-> Does anybody here know chosen?  I'm trying to figure out how it decides on the dimensions to give its input boxes. When I generate one here, it's setting element.style.width=0px
[12:50:50] <JavaLover> I know this is out of the ordinary but can you guys please take strawpoll i'm very sorry this is off topic http://strawpoll.me/4587766
[12:53:41] <decx> where's the third option? ▭ IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK
[12:54:20] <arc_> DarkGhost you around yet?
[12:55:03] <spottieottie> here's mine
[12:55:04] <spottieottie> http://strawpoll.me/4587795
[12:57:49] <randomguy1> so much straw on my laptop.  strange development
[13:00:16] <glowdemon1> http://paste.ofcode.org/3YkbpK2zP3FG47Ut8r394s, can someone help me a bit?
[13:00:34] <glowdemon1> I'm trying to make a form validation but it wont even trigger the function
[13:00:44] <spottieottie> went to link get a 404 error
[13:00:59] <spottieottie> there's a comma in your link
[13:01:05] <glowdemon1> http://paste.ofcode.org/3YkbpK2zP3FG47Ut8r394s
[13:01:40] <randomguy1> glowdemon1: can you provide the html it relates to as well?
[13:02:08] <glowdemon1> http://paste.ofcode.org/cT8CSD3iystrt5U5QuFLnz
[13:03:08] <randomguy1> glowdemon1: k, so your usage of $POST is weird
[13:03:21] <randomguy1> glowdemon1: use a selector instead
[13:03:29] <glowdemon1> Alright
[13:03:39] <randomguy1> glowdemon1: also ids are unique to a page
[13:04:31] <glowdemon1> What do you mean?
[13:04:44] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs.
[13:04:48] <randomguy1> glowdemon1: both of your forms have the same ids for their elements
[13:04:56] <randomguy1> glowdemon1: nesting does not make ids unique to a page
[13:04:57] <Wes-> Sort-of answer to my own query, chosen seems to calculate element dimension based on "reading" the original element..if I delay it long enough, it works okay, but that's obviously not a real solution.
[13:05:04] <glowdemon1> ah
[13:05:13] <robertmaxrees> Wes- what was your question?
[13:06:22] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to understand how chosen decides how big to draw its boxes, because it's drawing mine with element.style.width=0
[13:06:40] <robertmaxrees> it's probably at least partially based on when you call it.
[13:08:04] <glowdemon1> Q: Can POST be used when the form isnt submitted yet?
[13:08:09] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: Yeah, that's what I'm gathering from my troubleshooting an inability to demonstrate the problem with a simple test case. :)
[13:08:15] <robertmaxrees> glowdemon1 for AJAX, yes.
[13:08:23] <glowdemon1> thanks
[13:08:25] <robertmaxrees> Wes- are you familiar with Document Ready?
[13:11:22] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: moderately.  I *think* I'm triggering way, way after Document Ready fires.  (and I just found out that initializing it seems stable with a 0ms timeout - :puzzled:)  .... The app uses CommonJS modules, loads more content from the server, loads *more* CommonJS modules (dynamic dependencies), then in one module's init function it bangs data into a <select> and on the next line...
[13:11:24] <Wes-> ...initializes chosen.
[13:12:28] <Wes-> So I'm guessing chosen reads the select before the browser has figured out how big that select box is going to be.  Hm - I should chase down how the options are populated, maybe there is some kind of async behaviour in there I don't know about
[13:18:44] <glowdemon1> http://paste.ofcode.org/gganZnH6GGTGUJpxp68tGq cleaned up a bit, but the event doesnt seem to get triggered at all
[13:18:58] <glowdemon1> it outputs 'Hi' but not 'bad'
[13:19:09] <CharlesAtum> Sigh, new bug because I load the forms dinamically
[13:19:58] <Wes-> robertmaxrees: thanks for the prompting: it turns out that the scrollWidth of the <select> is 0 when I initialize chosen, and my document is still (surprise!) in readyState "interactive"
[13:20:13] <glowdemon1> hold up
[13:20:31] <glowdemon1> Found the error
[13:20:33] <CharlesAtum> Anyone can help me on this one?
[13:20:35] <CharlesAtum> http://fiddle.jshell.net/8q1f83nd/
[13:21:18] <CharlesAtum> Looks like the ('#cod_cat).val(id) runs before the form gets loaded into the page.
[13:24:48] <glowdemon1> jquery : symbols, symbols everywhere
[13:24:52] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:25:32] <robertmaxrees> CharlesAtum where does the form get loaded?
[13:27:56] <CharlesAtum> robertmaxrees: Updated the jsfiddle with the form div
[13:28:30] <CharlesAtum> The forms get loaded into #form_data
[13:28:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:28:44] <robertmaxrees> where does the form get loaded?
[13:30:39] <CharlesAtum> I use .load() and they are loaded into #form_data
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.  you need to put your other code in the done callback of that load call.
[13:37:15] <CharlesAtum> That worked, thanks.
[13:38:18] <gambl0re> $(this).children('a').children('p.text').slideToggle('fast');  <== this works. but when i try to do ==> var $text = $(this).children('a').children('p.text') ====== $text.slideToggle('fast'); ==> it doesnt work. anybody know why?
[13:38:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:39:12] <gambl0re> what..
[13:39:17] <gambl0re> is that how its done
[13:39:18] <robertmaxrees> what's with the random ==== in the middle of the code?
[13:39:39] <gambl0re> just to help you understnad it better
[13:39:40] <CharlesAtum> I think it represents a line break
[13:39:52] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re try usinbg fixee instead.
[13:40:23] <gambl0re> basically what im trying to do is put this -> $(this).children('a').children('p.text') in a variable "var $text"
[13:40:35] <robertmaxrees> that should work.
[13:40:39] <gambl0re> but it doesnt.
[13:40:43] <robertmaxrees> show a fiddle then.
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> prove it :)
[13:40:56] <gambl0re> ok
[13:41:24] <gambl0re> how do i do it in jfiddle?
[13:41:30] <gambl0re> my html code is too long/complicated
[13:41:37] <robertmaxrees> a simplified example.
[13:41:54] <gambl0re> ok
[13:42:14] <CharlesAtum> Can I use val to set the combobox to the value of the option intead of the description of the option?
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> CharlesAtum yes, assuming i understand the question.
[13:43:49] <gambl0re> i cant do a simplified version...if i use a variable like "$text = ...." do i include the dollar sign when substituting the line with the variable?
[13:44:05] <gambl0re> or just the name?
[13:44:18] <robertmaxrees> the dollar sign is just apart of the variable name.
[13:44:35] <gambl0re> so i dont put it?
[13:44:59] <robertmaxrees> if you declare it with the dollar sign, you use it.
[13:45:09] <gambl0re> i tried with and without it, still doesnt work
[13:45:10] <CharlesAtum> Oh, I was using the wrong selector.
[13:45:20] <CharlesAtum> Thanks anyway, robertmaxrees:
[13:45:28] <robertmaxrees> CharlesAtum hah.  that'd to it :)
[13:45:29] <robertmaxrees> *do
[13:45:40] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re http://fixee.org/paste/n6gdjf9/#url=vubuv42
[13:46:01] <robertmaxrees> they do the same thing.
[13:46:34] <CharlesAtum> Okay, now this one seems to be done.
[13:46:34] <robertmaxrees> if you're still having issues and "can't" get us a simplified test case, check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[13:47:09] <CharlesAtum> Pretty functionally, but not too much visually.
[13:48:10] <gambl0re> http://jsfiddle.net/m1v4gw9x/1/
[13:48:13] <gambl0re> lines 8-20
[13:48:37] <gambl0re> if i do it the long way it works, why i try to use variables, shit stops working.
[13:49:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:49:18] <gambl0re> huh what
[13:49:27] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a self-contained example.
[13:50:02] <gambl0re> me no understand..
[13:50:09] <robertmaxrees> there's no html.
[13:50:20] <robertmaxrees> what isn't working here?
[13:50:29] <robertmaxrees> because $text.children('a').children('p.text').fadeToggle('fast'); won't work.
[13:50:31] <gambl0re> i know......i didnt include the html
[13:50:38] <gambl0re> obviously
[13:51:09] <gambl0re> forget about the functionality, does the code look right to you?
[13:51:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:51:15] <robertmaxrees> i just explained why.
[13:51:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m1v4gw9x/3/
[13:51:28] <gambl0re> becaesu i didnt include the html?
[13:52:42] <robertmaxrees> that example is predicated on your selectors/DOM traversal being accurate btw
[13:52:43] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[13:53:32] <gambl0re> its correct, becaues like i said. if i do it the long way (without variables) it works
[13:53:50] <gambl0re> so it has to be, that somewhere the syntax is wrong
[13:53:51] <robertmaxrees> then $text.fadeToggle('fast'); should work just fine.
[13:54:09] <gambl0re> then wtf...
[13:54:23] <robertmaxrees> dunno.  if i could see a self-contained example, i could help you more.
[13:54:36] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[13:54:37] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:54:49] <robertmaxrees> btw - var $caption = $(this).children('a').children('p.caption'); - what is $(this) supposed to be?
[13:55:18] <gambl0re> 'div.portfolio-item'
[13:55:24] <robertmaxrees> you see the issue now?
[13:55:56] <gambl0re> wait...
[13:56:07] <robertmaxrees> var $caption = $(this).children('a').children('p.caption'); is not the same outside and inside the function.
[13:56:32] <robertmaxrees> the issue isn't the variable, it's your understanding of $(this)
[13:56:42] <gambl0re> $($(this)
[13:56:45] <robertmaxrees> nop.
[13:56:47] <robertmaxrees> *nope.
[13:56:53] <robertmaxrees> you cannot use $(this) in this case.
[13:56:57] <gambl0re> why
[13:56:58] <robertmaxrees> not there at least.
[13:57:13] <robertmaxrees> $(this) inside the event handler is the element you're bound to.
[13:57:20] <robertmaxrees> outside of the event handler, it's not that.
[13:57:23] <robertmaxrees> in this case, it's the document./
[13:57:31] <robertmaxrees> you need to select relative to the handler anyway.
[13:57:36] <arc_> what does starting a variable name with $ do
[13:57:37] <gambl0re> ohhh. so i put the variable inside!
[13:57:42] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re no.
[13:57:46] <robertmaxrees> err, yes.
[13:57:49] <robertmaxrees> arc_ it's a convention.
[13:57:57] <robertmaxrees> signals to others that it's a jquery object.
[13:58:03] <gambl0re> i put the variable inside the function!
[13:58:06] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re but that won't do you any good.
[13:58:08] <gambl0re> then it should work
[13:58:10] <gambl0re> why!
[13:58:16] <gambl0re> then itll point to the selector
[13:58:24] <arc_> i see. so it doesn't actually do anything different then, it's just an indicator
[13:58:52] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m1v4gw9x/4/
[13:58:57] <robertmaxrees> this is what you'd wind up with.
[14:00:11] <gambl0re> yea it works
[14:00:26] <gambl0re> thats what i said, put the varialbe inside the event handler function
[14:00:35] <robertmaxrees> sure, though i don't see the benefit here.
[14:01:12] <gambl0re> isnt it supposed to improve performance or something.
[14:01:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:01:22] <gambl0re> "refactor"
[14:01:23] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of selector "caching".
[14:01:29] <robertmaxrees> and that's not how you do that.
[14:01:30] <gambl0re> yea caching i mean
[14:01:38] <gambl0re> how would i do it?
[14:01:44] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.
[14:02:09] <robertmaxrees> first off, do it with the portfolio-item selectors
[14:02:15] <gambl0re> ok
[14:03:55] <robertmaxrees> second off, you want to store $(this) inside those handlers instead.
[14:04:14] <robertmaxrees> third, you can remove one of those event listeners - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m1v4gw9x/4/
[14:04:16] <robertmaxrees> can just do this.
[14:04:31] <robertmaxrees> oh and don't do $('p.caption').hide(); - add a rule to your CSS.
[14:05:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m1v4gw9x/5/ like this.
[14:05:28] <gambl0re> display none?
[14:05:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:05:36] <gambl0re> why?
[14:05:43] <robertmaxrees> because that's what .hide() is actually doing.
[14:05:54] <gambl0re> yea but why not just .hide()
[14:06:04] <robertmaxrees> because it's a default statue
[14:06:06] <robertmaxrees> *state
[14:06:11] <robertmaxrees> your CSS should handle that for you.
[14:06:20] <gambl0re> ok fine..
[14:06:21] <gambl0re> ok thanks
[14:06:25] <gambl0re> everything works now.
[14:06:39] <robertmaxrees> oh and don't prepend selectors with tags.
[14:06:44] <robertmaxrees> instead of p.text, just .text
[14:07:51] <gambl0re> no i cant...text is classname
[14:08:02] <robertmaxrees> right.  so use it.
[14:08:18] <gambl0re> yea thats why i used p.text
[14:08:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:08:27] <robertmaxrees> no - you only want .text
[14:08:30] <gambl0re> text is clas name
[14:08:34] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:08:39] <robertmaxrees> i can see - i am not blind :)
[14:08:44] <robertmaxrees> you can select just using the classname.
[14:08:50] <gambl0re> but what if i had other elements with .text class
[14:08:54] <robertmaxrees> don't.
[14:08:56] <gambl0re> it would get mixed up
[14:08:57] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[14:09:05] <gambl0re> its necessary sometimes
[14:09:08] <robertmaxrees> your classes should only apply to a specific element.
[14:09:33] <robertmaxrees> if you have utility classes for things like clearfixes or whatever, create a new class to work with.
[14:09:33] <gambl0re> sometimes i have classes with p, a, div, header elements
[14:09:37] <gambl0re> i share with everything.
[14:09:40] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> and makes your code much harder to reason about.
[14:10:13] <gambl0re> i know...if you saw my html/css, you probably get a heart attack
[14:10:20] <gambl0re> im trying to make it better.
[14:10:25] <robertmaxrees> so start doing things the right way now.
[14:10:34] <gambl0re> ok
[14:11:04] <gambl0re> is that best practice, to use a class name for only one type of element?
[14:11:18] <robertmaxrees> it's more complex than that.
[14:11:43] <gambl0re> also i see lots of tutorials doing element.class
[14:11:53] <robertmaxrees> if you have utility classes (for things like css clearfixes) then no.  but your markup should be declarative and specific.
[14:11:55] <gambl0re> so i thought that way was best practice
[14:11:58] <robertmaxrees> and those aren't good tutorials.
[14:12:18] <gambl0re> i see..
[14:12:23] <gambl0re> good info..
[14:24:19] <spottieottie> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide11   that is its own URL entirely right
[14:24:35] <spottieottie> the transitioning through each of those slides, each of those slides is its own url?
[14:26:57] <robertmaxrees> hashes, yeah
[14:29:21] <spottieottie> im not sure what you mean hashes
[14:29:38] <arc_> # = hash
[14:29:52] <spottieottie> i know that, but why did he say hashes, they are just urls
[14:30:01] <arc_> because they are a separate concept
[14:30:11] <arc_> hashchange is an event
[14:30:15] <spottieottie> and that concept is?
[14:30:38] <arc_> they scroll your browser to a specific location on the page instead of directing your browser to a new page : /
[14:31:19] <spottieottie> why do you have to put that stupid face if someone is trying to learn
[14:31:57] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[14:32:14] <duch_kazatel> which "stupid face"?
[14:32:28] <spottieottie> :/
[14:32:34] <arc_> your questioning was confrontational so i assumed you thought you already knew the answer, rather than being curious about what the answer is
[14:32:34] <spottieottie> thats unecessary
[14:32:54] <spottieottie> it was hardly confrontational at all, by asking what something is?
[14:33:18] <arc_> you asked, but on the same line also stated that it is what you think it is
[14:35:21] <robertmaxrees> spottieottie because the server doesn't respond to the # part.
[14:35:31] <robertmaxrees> that's all in-browser.
[14:44:16] <cjohnson> afaik the server never even sees the #
[14:44:26] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:44:29] <cjohnson> which is how some pastebins secure decryption keys for their private pastes
[14:44:32] <cjohnson> the server never gets the key
[14:50:21] <arc_> DarkGhost are you around
[14:51:19] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: what have you done with robertmaxrees
[14:51:28] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: did you just ircnap him
[14:51:35] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:59:54] <acidjazz> dont play games DUCH_KAZATEL
[15:00:46] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:01:00] <acidjazz> http://cowboyjob.com/member/duch_kazatel what is this
[15:01:09] <acidjazz> whats a cowboy job
[15:01:10] <acidjazz> is that sexual
[15:02:14] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:02:32] <robertmaxrees> is that nsfw ooor...?
[15:03:23] <acidjazz> no its not it seems to be some irc logging thing
[15:03:27] <robertmaxrees> weird
[15:04:00] <acidjazz> who the f is this http://cowboyjob.com/member/acidjazz
[15:06:16] <acidjazz> someone in here has been scrapeing
[15:06:19] <acidjazz> and feeding
[15:06:44] <acidjazz> seema ll over freenode
[15:06:49] <acidjazz> seems all*
[15:10:03] <arc_> wow, so now i can see what channels people are in even if those channels are +s
[15:10:07] <arc_> great
[15:10:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's sketch
[15:12:41] <arc_> what is even the purpose of this
[15:12:58] <arc_> cowboyjob.com: Most Active Forum in the World for Geeks!
[15:13:12] <arc_> not a forum at all
[15:14:09] <acidjazz> yea arc_ as long as hes in there
[15:14:16] <acidjazz> it might be an irc client actually
[15:14:42] <decx> what a cheeky way to generate thousands of pages with "unique" content
[15:15:01] <decx> my oneliners are literally paying for your house cowboy dude
[15:15:33] <acidjazz> http://cowboyjob.com/category/
[15:15:41] <acidjazz> well i dont see any ads
[15:16:43] <decx> maybe it's a long con
[15:16:54] <acidjazz> 74,340 members
[15:17:36] <acidjazz> lol did he like randomly generate icons
[15:17:39] <decx> so you generate thousands of fake users and then sell your "community" to some fool
[15:17:45] <kevireilly> while the logger could have a unique nick for each channel, if it doesn’t, it should be fairly easy to figure out who
[15:17:46] <acidjazz> with shapes and eye variants
[15:18:05] <acidjazz> kevireilly: logger(s)
[15:18:27] <acidjazz> well it stopped may 19th
[15:18:45] <kevireilly> the perpetrator
[15:19:02] <kevireilly> ah
[15:21:25] <decx> maybe cowboyjob is programming a forum from scratch and needed a few thousands rows of demodata
[15:21:44] <acidjazz> hes pulling in url content
[15:21:44] <acidjazz> http://cowboyjob.com/member/robertmaxrees?page=5
[15:22:00] <decx> and on irc you get all kinds of links for which you can write
[15:22:04] <decx> stuff
[15:22:05] <arc_> and images
[15:22:10] <decx> jsfiddle includes, images, videos
[15:22:33] <arc_> probably twitter, steam, amazon, newegg, instagram
[15:23:00] <decx> better than creating demodata with lorem ipsum i guess ^^
[15:24:21] <decx> man i need to catch up
[15:24:31] <decx> 3000 posts behind robertmaxrees
[15:25:37] <arc_> i run a bot on the same nick as i talk, and i only have 1781 "posts"
[15:26:06] <arc_> and i talk a lot ;/
[15:27:04] <acidjazz> lol whats your bot do
[15:27:20] <arc_> it's for a game. just has lookups for various things
[15:27:32] <arc_> countdown timers for events, etc
[15:27:34] <acidjazz> yea? game called cowboyjob?
[15:27:40] <arc_> lol -_-
[15:27:41] <arc_> path of exile
[15:28:19] <acidjazz> you wrote a bot that conncets to your path of exile account?
[15:28:52] <arc_> no, it just has information that is helpful to be able to quickly look up
[15:29:08] <acidjazz> and you waht.. are grinding and checking your gold and loot?
[15:29:19] <arc_> no, it's a static database
[15:29:24] <acidjazz> i had a wow bot report to a site
[15:29:36] <acidjazz> p cool
[15:29:41] <arc_> it's for the #pathofexile channel, not just for me
[15:29:42] <acidjazz> so its a bot connected to a db
[15:29:52] <arc_> that's a glorified way of putting it :p
[15:29:59] <arc_> the database is just text files lol
[15:30:10] <acidjazz> how old is this game
[15:30:26] <arc_> closed beta began being available to the public in 2011
[15:30:33] <arc_> to some of the public i mean
[15:30:44] <acidjazz> wow pretty gfx
[15:30:53] <acidjazz> 2011 dang
[15:31:18] <arc_> it's free to play, one of the only f2p games with a completely non-pay to win model
[15:31:51] <acidjazz> how do they make moneys
[15:31:57] <arc_> cosmetics
[15:32:23] <arc_> and because the game is awesome :p
[15:35:00] <acidjazz> so it seems liek hes recording "discussions"
[15:35:01] <acidjazz> http://cowboyjob.com/composer/2015-05-19
[15:35:06] <acidjazz> arc_: cosmetics?
[15:35:48] <arc_> yes, like armor skins and special spell effects and non-combat pets
[15:50:32] <Pazician> Why does this wont work? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/68544c52cefd7e7437bb
[15:52:41] <Pazician> Ugh, got it. I have to call like this $.fn.funName
[15:59:04] <robertmaxrees> why is that in the method namespace?
[16:19:07] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: What do you mean, or are talking to me?
[16:25:32] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[16:28:10] <robertmaxrees> Pazician oh, yeah that was to you.
[16:28:31] <robertmaxrees> $.fn is where you put jquery methods so you can do stuff like $('.someClass').foo()
[16:29:42] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Oh, alright. Well, it didn't really work out without the ".fn", I was just calling it like this: "$.funName", and that didn't work out, no idea why tho.
[16:30:17] <robertmaxrees> right, because it's declared as $.fn.animation
[16:30:19] <robertmaxrees> which is a bad idea.
[16:33:36] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Hm...  I've a hard time to understand, sorry.
[16:33:48] <robertmaxrees> did you write this?
[16:34:06] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Yes, but I did a few Google's on function plugins.
[16:34:13] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a plugin.
[16:34:19] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want $.fn.animation = function() {
[16:35:18] <robertmaxrees> so just do this: http://fixee.org/paste/viuqfyj/
[16:36:03] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Oh, so just a variable, right? Ugh, god. So easy when you really know how to do it, lol.
[16:36:12] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Thank you, big thanks.
[16:36:15] <robertmaxrees> i also removed the IIFE
[16:36:21] <robertmaxrees> because you don't need it here either.
[16:38:45] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: And what was the thing I just wrote before?
[16:39:07] <Pazician> I mean, it worked out, but does is it called anything?
[16:39:16] <robertmaxrees> what thing?
[16:39:22] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.animation = function() {} ?
[16:39:26] <Pazician> Yeah, right.
[16:39:33] <robertmaxrees> you use that when writing plugins
[16:40:19] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Oh, alright. Plugins, you mean like waypoint plugin or maybe w/e that have an external file?
[16:40:25] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:40:47] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of like waypoint - you notice how you call waypoint?
[16:41:07] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Yeah, right. Like an function, right?
[16:41:13] <robertmaxrees> *a method.
[16:41:18] <robertmaxrees> on a jquery object.
[16:41:28] <robertmaxrees> $('.someclass').doSomething();
[16:41:32] <robertmaxrees> vs just doSomething()
[16:41:46] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Yeah, that's totally right.
[16:41:54] <robertmaxrees> the latter implies that you're acting againts $('.someClass'); the latter doesn't.
[16:42:44] <Pazician> Hm... So I guess it's more right to just assign an variable instead of doing a plugin thing I did?
[16:42:49] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:43:01] <robertmaxrees> and ditch the wrapper you were using.
[16:43:16] <robertmaxrees> the (function( $ ){})(jQuery) thing.
[16:43:25] <robertmaxrees> unless you're in noconflict mode
[16:43:34] <Pazician> What does that mean?
[16:43:49] <robertmaxrees> which part?  the noconflict thing?
[16:43:55] <Pazician> Yeah
[16:44:21] <robertmaxrees> you likely don't need to worry about it - it's a way to use jquery with other libraries that want to use $ as their "name" as well.
[16:45:18] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Alright, thank you so much, well explained really appreciate your help
[16:48:50] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: One more thing, it seems not to work out inside the resize function, is there any way to call the variable outside the function, since I guess it doesn't remember the variable when it's outside the function like that?
[16:49:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:50:01] <Pazician> I've a function, the resize function. When the variable is outside the function it doesn't remember the variable, right? - And that's why it doesn't work on window resize.
[16:50:13] <robertmaxrees> still not following.
[16:50:17] <robertmaxrees> "remember" what variable?
[16:51:19] <Pazician> The animation variable I just wrote, as you said I should do. Do I need to repeat that process? If I do have to repeat that variable inside the function, then it's better to use the one I had before right, since I don't need to repeat it?
[16:51:37] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to do anything else.
[16:51:41] <robertmaxrees> fixee.org/paste/viuqfyj/
[16:51:46] <robertmaxrees> this will work just fine.
[16:52:17] <Pazician> It's seems that it doesn't work out on resize.
[16:52:43] <robertmaxrees> then you have a problem in your code :)
[16:53:34] <Pazician> But isn't it like this, like the variables isn't remembered inside the function if they're outside the function it self?
[16:53:37] <robertmaxrees> you could add a console.log to the animation function and see if that runs?
[16:53:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:53:49] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "remembered"?
[16:54:00] <robertmaxrees> are you asking if you can "see" animation from within the resize?
[16:56:34] <Pazician> What I mean with "remembered" is, if the variable is Outside the function, like the resize function I got in this situation, is it true that the variable then appears do be forgotten inside the function, the resize function? Like this, one more time: If I assign a variable Outside the function, w/e function, doesn't matter, just a function then will it work Inside the function when I call the variable? Do you unders
[16:56:34] <Pazician> tand me?
[16:57:24] <robertmaxrees> barely - are you asking if you have access to variables declared outside a function?
[16:57:40] <Pazician> Yes, right
[16:57:50] <robertmaxrees> you do, as long as it's in a 'parent' scope.
[16:58:09] <Pazician> What do you mean with "parent scope"?
[16:58:49] <robertmaxrees> given this example: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0zh1dmm1/
[16:59:11] <robertmaxrees> you can access "foo" everywhere, since it's global.  that means you can access it inside functionOne and functionTwo
[16:59:16] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense so far?
[16:59:48] <arc_> yo DarkGhost
[17:00:46] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Is this written right and, it seems not to work out right? http://jsfiddle.net/0zh1dmm1/1/
[17:01:08] <robertmaxrees> that's a syntax error - $($(window).resize(function() { is wrong.
[17:01:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0zh1dmm1/2/
[17:01:52] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Oh, yeah right. But can I call the variable in that way?
[17:02:01] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:02:25] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Why doesn't it work?
[17:02:34] <robertmaxrees> in that fiddle?
[17:02:37] <Pazician> Shouldn't it print out something? Yes.
[17:02:54] <robertmaxrees> because $(document).html(foo); is a bad way to test that.
[17:03:09] <robertmaxrees> you also didn't have jquery included.
[17:03:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0zh1dmm1/3/
[17:03:17] <robertmaxrees> notice this works.
[17:03:59] <arc_> i kinda wish jsfiddle would automatically include jquery or at least warn you when you try to do jquery stuff without it included
[17:04:07] <arc_> maybe if you sign up it has that option
[17:04:08] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[17:04:23] <robertmaxrees> $ is used for more than JQ
[17:04:33] <arc_> ya i know
[17:04:40] <Pazician> Hmm... So weird, I was always thinking that I was always in need to call the variable inside the function again, but it seems that it's just bs.
[17:04:59] <robertmaxrees> "call the variable inside the function again"?
[17:05:03] <robertmaxrees> you mean declare it again?
[17:05:11] <Pazician> Yeah, right
[17:05:27] <Pazician> Well, I do not know why mine doesn't work out right then.
[17:05:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.  as long as the variable was defined in a "parent" scope, you're find.
[17:05:28] <robertmaxrees> *fine
[17:05:45] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthexejquery.com <- check out this guide :)
[17:06:14] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Would you mind to check my code maybe? I couldn't see the link, seems down
[17:06:26] <robertmaxrees> www.fixingthesejquery.com
[17:06:28] <robertmaxrees> typo
[17:06:40] <robertmaxrees> if you really want meto look, make a fiddle.
[17:07:46] <Pazician> Can't you just do a fast overlook, maybe there's just a small problem that you see at the first sight?
[17:07:55] <Pazician> Thanks for the link
[17:07:57] <acidjazz> awesomeee http://www.amp-what.com/
[17:12:31] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: It was a dumb thing that was messing it all up... Ugh, thank you so much, you were right about the call variable thing. Thanks again.
[18:03:39] <Lencl> hello
[18:03:56] <Lencl> jQuery makes text inputs nice and pretty

[18:04:18] <Lencl> but when I dynamically add the inputs, it won't make them nice a pretty... stays as native
[18:04:39] <Lencl> By nice and pretty, I mean it adds the <div> between the input and stylizes it

[19:56:12] <jqueryius> is it possible to FORCE a control to always stay shown
[19:56:35] <jqueryius> i'm using a datepicker and for some reason, clicking outside of the area causes it to disappear and I can't figure out way
[19:56:44] <jqueryius> so if I could just do something to force it to stay shown i'd be happy
[19:59:16] <jqueryius> if I type $('.datepicker').show(); in console then it reappears
[19:59:22] <jqueryius> so i figure something is forcing it to .hide
