[00:00:02] <Cork> heh k
[00:00:12] <Cork> gnarf: thx btw
[00:00:31] <gnarf> i see you in here all the time - so yeah - police the spam for a bit ;)
[00:01:05] <vladikoff> what if Cork is one of em!
[00:01:15] * Cork smerks
[00:01:24] <Cork> *evil plans*
[00:01:26] <Cork> :D
[00:01:54] <noaXess> Cork: the problem is.. the search field itself i can customize normally.. but the ul/li that comes up after entering a search term come with the main ui css, instead of to customized css
[00:01:55] <Cork> noaXess: i', actually not sure autocomplete uses separat elements for each autocomplete
[00:02:07] <Cork> noaXess: it might actually be a shared element for all
[00:02:38] <Cork> noaXess: ya, cause its not a child or similar to the input field
[00:02:50] <Cork> noaXess: it positioned at the bottom in the body
[00:02:56] <Cork> (append)
[00:03:39] <noaXess> Cork: jep i see.. hm... or adding the special classes near the input field.. to overwrite the default one...
[00:03:43] <Cork> noaXess: you could try adding a wrapper around the field, and give that as the appendTo field
[00:03:44] <noaXess> hm.. have to test that...
[00:03:57] <Cork> and then set the css in relation to that parent
[00:04:09] <Cork> SHOULD work, though i haven't tested it
[00:04:11] <dirkpennings> Cork, Firefox 8 registers keydown AND keypress when holding key..
[00:04:17] <Archaic_G> using jquery.jplayer .. it calls functions by a div's ID name,  how can i execute those functions from a child window?
[00:04:20] <dirkpennings> is that right?
[00:04:24] <noaXess> Cork: ok.. try that.. later..need to visit a customer.. bbs.. thanks
[00:04:33] <Cork> dirkpennings: exactly, thats what i tried to explain up there
[00:04:41] <Cork> dirkpennings: so ya, thats expected
[00:05:00] <dirkpennings> Cork: ok, and keyup only fires when releasing?
[00:05:12] <Cork> yes
[00:05:21] <dirkpennings> Cork: ok, clear, thanks! :)
[00:05:22] <Cork> its "key up" after all ;)
[00:05:25] <Cork> np
[00:06:08] <Archaic_G> basically, I want to turn something like:  $("#playlist-next").click(function() { myPlaylist.next(); });    into  	onclick="playlistnext();"   any ideas?
[00:06:40] <Cork> Archaic_G: why do you want to use inline event handlers?
[00:06:41] <Archaic_G> err  onclick="parent.playlistnext();"
[00:07:22] <Archaic_G> well, I don't really - but thats how the playlist plugin comes.. threw me for a loop :S
[00:07:31] <Cork> >_>
[00:07:34] <Cork> jiks...
[00:07:42] * Cork has a look at the plugin
[00:09:23] <Cork> Archaic_G: whats myPlaylist in your click handler?
[00:10:34] <Cork> Archaic_G: ah, its an jPlayerPlaylist instance?
[00:12:12] <Archaic_G> ya.. just using the jplayer demo's for now..  what I had was: child window would tell jplayer to "pause" no problem.. then i got the idea of installing a playlist, and jplayer("next") doesnt exactly work - so that was my big idea anyway, not sure if thats the route i should be going
[00:12:50] <Archaic_G> the plugin is designed so u can use an anchor to manipulate it, but that doesnt seem to do me any good from an iframe
[00:13:06] <Cork> Archaic_G: either store the player globaly
[00:13:25] <Cork> or in .data on an element should get you going as far as i can see
[00:15:29] <Archaic_G> hmm okay thanks! ill check into that
[00:16:13] <dnsdds> Inside the custom helper function of jQuery UI draggable, how can I select the original object or any copy of it, as I need the data inside it?
[00:36:53] <asterisk-Tester> Hi, I am using the validaotr plugin described here : http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#Example , is there a way to just get the result 1 or 0 in a variable from the call of validate() without using a label or such ?
[00:39:00] <jbooker> can anyone suggest why a function that's been attached to a form with $(".form-commentAdd").submit(function(e)....   isn't triggered, when elsewhere $(".form-commentAdd").submit() is used?
[00:40:22] <IvanKuzev> jbooker: if you try to attach the function before the form exist in the dom..or you made a typing mistake
[00:42:12] <jbooker> IvanKuzev: oh crap thanks - im using delegation everywhere but here, idiot. thanks
[00:44:44] <ximarin> hi all, can someone tell me what is wrong with this one: if( $("input[type=text]").is(":valid") ){
[00:45:08] <ximarin> firebug says: unrecognized expression: valid
[00:45:27] <sente> how is 'valid' supposed to work?
[00:45:41] <IvanKuzev> yeah ...i havent heard of such selector
[00:46:19] <ximarin> it tells if the input is valid against a pattern, like <input type="text" style="width:250px;" id="smth" pattern="\??[a-zA-Z0-9\-\s]*\??">
[00:46:44] <ximarin> it works fine if I do it on a single input, but not on a bunch of inputs
[00:46:47] <sente> what script does this?
[00:46:59] <ximarin> no script, its hmtl5/css3
[00:47:03] <sente> crazy
[00:47:05] <sente> oh how the times change
[00:47:09] <ximarin> ^^
[00:53:10] <ximarin> I think it's still in draft-mode, but ff and chrome use it and it makes fun ;)
[00:55:06] <Cork> ximarin: no its stable and has been for quite some time as far as i remember
[01:01:02] <JackJones> hi, what is the best way to synchronize a local webdb with a remote db ?
[01:04:15] <k1t> JackJones: not with jQuery
[01:04:17] <k1t> lol
[01:04:30] <JackJones> k1t: why not ?
[01:04:47] <sanjayb> JackJones: well, its more a javascript / general problem than anything to do specifically with jquery.
[01:04:51] <jbooker> i have got an issue with .find().first() it returns an array, not just the first instance of the .find() result like i expect
[01:05:26] <sanjayb> jbooker: yes, it does :-). you can do .eq(0) or something if u want just the first elem
[01:05:29] <JackJones> sanjayb: okay thank you, what you think is the best way for this ?
[01:07:05] <jbooker> sanjay - never mind, i figured it out, i was trying to use var $frm = $(this).find("selector").first() then $frm[0].attr instead of just $frm.attr
[01:11:35] <sanjayb> JackJones: actually, am trying to figure out a similar thing for a couple projects, and not really sure :/ -- do let know if you find a reasonable solution ..
[01:11:51] <sanjayb> jbooker: :)
[01:11:57] <JackJones> sanjayb: i think you have to do this with node.js
[01:12:10] <WalterTamboer> When using jQuery UI Sortable; Is it not allowed to manipulate the list with sortable items *after* started sorting?
[01:12:25] <sanjayb> JackJones: well, you need some language at the back-end to handle your server-side database -- this can be node.js or pretty much any back-end language, i think.
[01:13:00] <sanjayb> JackJones: and then something in the JS to chec / push those changes -- but ideally you would need some sort of frame-work on both the client and server to manage this -- not sure if there are some plugins / modules that already exist.
[01:13:41] <sanjayb> JackJones: also though, im not sure how generic a solution is possible -- I'm sure there would be lots of code specific to your project / structure ..
[01:14:23] <JackJones> sanjayb: yes, i think to, synchronizations are allways very heavy
[01:19:42] <RLa> JackJones, you need two-way sync?
[01:20:04] <shellox> hi, i need help with jquery ui again. I try to do validation with jquery ui. However it works as long a field name is "test" for example. My field names are myform[test] and the js fails to execute then because of the [
[01:20:07] <JackJones> RLa: no on way
[01:20:10] <shellox> any idea how to fix it?
[01:21:12] <RLa> JackJones, then store events (change/add/delete) not actual data, those are very easy to sync
[01:21:32] <RLa> JackJones, just replay events
[01:22:15] <JackJones> RLa: yes, thank you
[01:22:36] <JackJones> i'm wondering me, how i could display remote content with phone gap, maybe with a simple iframe
[01:23:01] <Kingsy> can someone take a look at this for me ...     http://renownedmedia.com/examples/nexus/ <-- is the example      www.kingsy.co.uk <--- my example   I cant see a reason why its not working, the code is the same afaik, basically I want to get it working and do some modding.. (obviously I am going to credit the makers)
[01:26:14] <ximarin> Cork: ah ok, I wasn't sure if I had seen this on a draft or on a final sheet. But is it known why the .is(":valid") does not work on a selector that returns more than one object?
[01:29:01] <NotStooge> how to get first and only child of a div?
[01:29:08] <NotStooge> $("#pt1\\:gantt\\:ctt\\:\\:scroller:first-child") didnt work
[01:29:15] <Cork> ximarin: not sure sizzle understands that selector
[01:29:31] <Cork> ximarin: that might be the cause
[01:29:36] <jbooker> can anyone explain to me why the jquery dialog doesn't do what the docs say it does. The docs say that .close() closes the dialog, and .destroy() 'will return the element back to its pre-init state' - however, both these functions completely remove my <div> from the DOM
[01:29:44] <ximarin> hm, ok, would make sense
[01:29:53] <shellox> really no one an idea why this doesnt work? https://gist.github.com/d33461e16d1c498c06b2
[01:29:58] <ximarin> I'm filing a ticket on this one
[01:30:03] <Cork> NotStooge: is 'pt1\\:gantt\\:ctt\\:\\:scroller' mean to be an id???
[01:30:08] <NotStooge> ye
[01:30:09] <NotStooge> s
[01:30:16] <Cork> thats not a valid id
[01:30:26] <Cork> your not allowed to have : in your id's
[01:30:26] <crab> to put it mildly.
[01:30:29] <Cork> not sure abut \
[01:30:37] <Cork> *about
[01:30:51] <NotStooge> alert($("#pt1\\:gantt\\:ctt\\:\\:scroller").length) returns 1 didnt work
[01:31:00] <NotStooge> i mean it is valid id 100% sure :)
[01:31:11] <NotStooge> with the \\ i am escaping :
[01:31:45] <NotStooge> pt1:gantt:ctt::scroller is the id
[01:32:46] <Kingsy> can someone possibly take a look at my issue?
[01:32:56] <NotStooge> -ask
[01:33:08] <NotStooge> -ask Kingsy
[01:33:18] <midori> Hello, help me to correct a small problem, please
[01:33:20] <shellox> NotStooge: you have an idea about it?
[01:33:25] <Kingsy> NotStooge: can someone take a look at this for me ...     http://renownedmedia.com/examples/nexus/ <-- is the example      www.kingsy.co.uk <--- my example   I cant see a reason why its not working, the code is the same afaik, basically I want to get it working and do some modding.. (obviously I am going to credit the makers)
[01:33:28] <Cork> NotStooge: ya, looks like i was wrong
[01:34:17] <midori> I navigate by scrolling to change the active menu item, it does not work if I put the tag article
[01:34:21] <NotStooge> sorry never used datepicker
[01:34:23] <midori> http://d7.rootnix.net/smorth/index.html
[01:34:29] <Kingsy> NotStooge: the js in question is <script src="http://www.kingsy.co.uk/js/jquery/nexus.js" type="text/javascript">
[01:34:45] <shellox> NotStooge: NotStooge datepicker is working
[01:34:59] <shellox> the problem are the brackets in the fieldname
[01:35:08] <shellox> it seem to break the js
[01:35:16] <Cork> NotStooge: not really an answer, but use .eq(0) after the selector
[01:35:31] <minna> Hm, how do i do a $(this :contains()); ??
[01:35:34] <NotStooge> ok ill try thanks
[01:35:56] <NotStooge> what do you mean by contains minna
[01:36:02] <Cork> minna: $(this).is(':contains()')
[01:36:08] <minna> NotStooge: Ah, is... thanks :-D
[01:36:17] <minna> oh, i mean Cork!
[01:36:24] <Cork> lol
[01:36:32] <midori> @Cork can u help me? a litle problem
[01:36:51] <Cork> whats the problem?
[01:37:35] <shellox> maybe i should post it on stackoverflow
[01:37:40] <midori> Cork Look http://d7.rootnix.net/smorth/index.html
[01:38:05] <NotStooge>  $("#pt1\\:gantt\\:ctt\\:\\:scroller").children().eq(0) worked
[01:38:06] <Myx0x3> how "bad" is it to use unicode special chars, like ▸ (if you can see it)
[01:38:27] <Myx0x3> on a website ofcs
[01:38:39] <Cork> jbooker: its .dialog('destroy') and .dialog('close')
[01:38:41] <midori> when you scroll the page should change the active menu item, when I put the tag an article that has stopped working
[01:38:51] <Cork> jbooker: and .dialog('destroy') should return it to its original state
[01:38:52] <NotStooge> shellox you can try using http://jsfiddle.net/ for javascript its nice
[01:39:12] <TJMonk> i have a problem $(...).width() I am using it an element that has its width set to 100% in css, and jquery is incorrectly returning 100 instead of the elements actual width
[01:39:18] <Kingsy> NotStooge: any ideas?
[01:39:32] <Cork> Myx0x3: as long as your encoding state unicode and the file is saved in utf-8 its fine
[01:40:30] <TJMonk> this is for jquery 1.7 btw
[01:40:36] <NotStooge> sorry Kingsy its too complicated for me
[01:40:48] <Cork> midori: your binding your scroll outside domready
[01:41:05] <Myx0x3> Cork: well, seems like Windows cant handle it (IE) guess i have to do it some other way.. fuuuu..
[01:41:43] <Cork> Myx0x3: it can handle it, the problem is with there stupid encoding sniffer
[01:41:49] <NotStooge> Kingsy do you add the jquery library?
[01:41:55] <TJMonk> Myx0x3: are you saving the file as utf8 with or without BOM?
[01:42:36] <Myx0x3> TJMonk: UTF-8 ofcs, we need it for swedish chars.. whats BOM?
[01:43:03] <TJMonk> Byte Order Marker. Find out if you have it there or not, and try switching to the opposite, maybe IE will work then?
[01:43:21] <Cork> ?g utf-8 bom @ Myx0x3
[01:43:22] <bot-t> Myx0x3, FAQ - UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM - http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html
[01:43:28] <midori> Cork but its work if i remove <arcticle>
[01:43:30] <TJMonk> On windows, notepad++ has an option to change the encoding easily
[01:43:31] <midori> why?
[01:43:52] <Kingsy> NotStooge: yeah its <script src="http://www.kingsy.co.uk/js/jquery/jquery.js" type="text/javascript">   <--- just above nexus.js you can see it in the head here
[01:43:54] <Cork> hmm not sure
[01:43:56] <Kingsy> there**
[01:43:56] * Cork checks again
[01:44:32] <Myx0x3> TJMonk: well, i think i forget the right arrow thing, and try to fix it with background-img in CSS..
[01:44:46] <TJMonk> anyone else having issues with width() returning the wrong value for elements given a % width value with jquery 1.7?
[01:44:46] <Myx0x3> feels more reliable
[01:45:01] <TJMonk> Myx0x3: agreed it is more reliable
[01:45:35] <Cork> ugg i hate when i do the mistake of setting a breakpoint in a scroll event -_-'
[01:45:38] <TJMonk> Myx0x3: or it feels more reliable anyways
[01:45:51] <TJMonk> @Cork: lol yea, thats no fun
[01:47:01] <Cork> midori: your js is invalid
[01:47:14] <Kingsy> NotStooge: spot anything?
[01:47:21] <NotStooge> no sorry :(
[01:47:27] <Cork> midori: you forgot an ) at like 151
[01:48:11] <NotStooge> http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/ xD
[01:49:32] <shellox> Cork: can you help me too?
[01:49:55] <Cork> shellox: i haven't use validate much
[01:50:07] <midori> Cork http://d7.rootnix.net/smorth/index.html refresh
[01:50:11] <midori> now its work
[01:50:15] <midori> yes?
[01:50:39] <Cork> shellox: oh sorry
[01:50:41] <Kingsy> Cork: don't suppose you could take a look?
[01:50:57] <Cork> shellox: was a bit too many questions at once there so mixed them up :)
[01:51:20] <Cork> Kingsy: let me try to keep my head straight, i'll try in a big :)
[01:51:30] <Kingsy> Cork: not a prblem
[01:51:37] <Kingsy> brb gotta restart
[01:51:43] <Cork> shellox: your question was about seletors with [] in them right?
[01:53:21] <shellox> yep
[01:53:34] <shellox> Cork: a fieldname is myform[field1] in my case
[01:53:40] <Cork> shellox: if your field name is 'myform[test]' select it as 'input[name="myform[test]"]' and it should work fine
[01:53:57] <Cork> the "" is needed to escape the [] in the name
[01:54:20] <Cork> i'll sugest to always use them for attrubute values to remove this kind of problems
[01:54:41] <Kingsy> back
[01:54:54] <Cork> Kingsy: so what was your problme?
[01:55:00] <Cork> *problem
[01:55:52] <Kingsy> Cork: I was trying to replicate a jquery gimmick on my site so I could mod it but it doesnt work at all (like doesnt even start, no errors or anything.. umm 1 sec I will get you the urls
[01:57:12] <Kingsy> Cork: http://renownedmedia.com/examples/nexus/  <-- example        http://www.kingsy.co.uk/   <--- my version
[01:57:48] <Kingsy> Cork: the js in question is nexus.js    my jquery lib is in    jquery.js   declared just above it
[01:59:27] <shellox> Cork: isn't working either
[01:59:31] <shellox> https://gist.github.com/0df5fc3f565b53f0e3b6
[02:01:54] <TJMonk> Kingsy: For some reason $ is being defined  somewhere is and jQuery is not set to it
[02:02:06] <TJMonk> in that script, try replacing $ with jQuery and you should be good to go
[02:02:26] <TJMonk> somewhere else*
[02:02:56] <Kingsy> TJMonk: ahhhhh I forgot about that, that was me damn
[02:03:25] <TJMonk> so a quick ctrl-h "$(" replace with "jQuery(" should get you up and running
[02:05:54] <Kingsy> TJMonk: thanks man.. thats awesome
[02:06:21] <Kingsy> TJMonk: one other thing totally unrelated, if you busy its fine, but I am trying to fix something in IE7 if you have a moment?
[02:06:32] <TJMonk> sure thing
[02:06:35] <shellox> ok, i got it :P
[02:06:41] <TJMonk> i need a break from my project anyways haha
[02:06:53] <shellox> just set it in ""
[02:08:09] <Kingsy> TJMonk: heh, well check this out.. 1 sec I will get the urls for ya
[02:08:15] <TJMonk> k
[02:09:30] <Kingsy> TJMonk : ok so load this in FF and IE7 --> http://www.giftedjewelry.com/56562.html <-- you can see the carousel at the bottom is fine in FF but is totally crazy in IE7
[02:10:29] <Kingsy> TJMonk : however, http://www.qpjewellers.com/16562.html  is pretty much a duplicate of the above link at that works on FF and IE7 ... the code is the same afaik...  what am I missing?
[02:10:54] <TJMonk> wow thats busted in ie9 as well
[02:10:58] <TJMonk> one sec
[02:11:34] <Kingsy> :S its weird
[02:13:03] <TJMonk> Kingsy: my immediate guess is that you are using full size images instead of thumbnails on the one page
[02:13:07] <Zladivliba> hi everyone !
[02:13:12] <TJMonk> just based on the size of the elements
[02:13:16] <TJMonk> Zlad: hola
[02:13:33] <Zladivliba> I'm trying to open/close a div with 2 different events : 	$('#email').click(function(){	$(".slider").slideToggle();	});}); 	$('#email').focusout(function(){	$(".slider").slideToggle();	});});
[02:13:39] <Zladivliba> but this doesn't work
[02:13:51] <Kingsy> TJMonk: what do you mean? you can see if you finally ge thte items to display, they are thumbs
[02:13:56] <Zladivliba> I mean the click is ok, but the focusout is not
[02:14:05] <TJMonk> Kingsy: but the images appear to be the right size hmm
[02:14:11] <Zladivliba> any idea how I can get the focusout to work ?
[02:14:15] <Zladivliba> TJMonk, hi !
[02:14:37] <TJMonk> Zlad: can you pastebin the code? that is kind of hard to read
[02:14:42] <Zladivliba> ok
[02:15:37] <Kingsy> TJMonk: hmm nope, I cant see anything thats using a full size image on that page that is different to the qp example
[02:16:02] <Zladivliba> TJMonk, : http://pastie.org/3014916
[02:16:14] <Zladivliba> the focus out doesn't work I don't understand why
[02:16:45] <TJMonk> Zlad: you have }); too many times on both lines
[02:16:57] <TJMonk> Kingsy: which js file creates the caurosel?
[02:17:02] <Zladivliba> ok, true !
[02:17:31] <Zladivliba> TJMonk, thanks a lot !!! it works
[02:17:36] <Kingsy> TJMonk: <script src="http://www.giftedjewelry.com/js/jquery/jquery.jcarousel.min.js" type="text/javascript">
[02:17:51] <Zladivliba> Indeed you were right thinking that the code needed a pastie ;-)
[02:18:00] <Zladivliba> got a clearer view of the problme
[02:18:09] <TJMonk> Zlad: Yep, usually helps alot :)
[02:18:38] <TJMonk> Kingsy: That is the code for th plugin, what about the code for $(...).caurosel({options...});
[02:19:12] <TJMonk> or $(...).jCarouselLite(...) in this case
[02:19:17] <Kingsy> TJMonk: ah sorry.. 1 second
[02:19:35] <IvanKuzev> Kingsy:...what...someone use carousel.....yay...too bad its not mine :(
[02:20:08] <Kingsy> TJMonk: http://pastie.org/3014930
[02:20:37] <Kingsy> IvanKuzev: lol perhaps if it was yours I wouldnt be having crazy issues
[02:22:28] <Cork> Kingsy: actually it looks like your page is working, its just missing some images
[02:22:40] <Cork> at least is spewing 404s in the console
[02:22:40] <TJMonk> Kingsy: Wow, the one that works fails to pass w3 validation, and the one that doesn't work passes no problems
[02:22:55] <Cork> (sorry for the delay, got busy)
[02:23:27] <Kingsy> Cork: what do you mean by missing images? the both examples shouldnt be missing any images..
[02:23:41] <Kingsy> TJMonk: huh really?
[02:23:56] <TJMonk> Kingsy: Yea....weird
[02:23:59] <Cork> Kingsy: "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://www.kingsy.co.uk/images/nexus/red-west.png"
[02:24:04] <TJMonk> Cork: I don't see any 404s from those pages
[02:24:06] <IvanKuzev> Kingsy : mine uses the jquery ui..and is curently in development...beta avalible
[02:24:22] <TJMonk> Cork: oh, I'm looking at a diff site now lol
[02:24:23] <Cork> for all -east, -south, grean, red, yellow
[02:24:25] <Kingsy> Cork: ah no sorry this is somethig different, thats happenin because I am messing around with it
[02:24:40] <Kingsy> hehe lol.. forget about kingsy.co.uk
[02:24:46] <Cork> ok
[02:24:48] <Cork> :)
[02:25:02] <Kingsy> the problem is on http://www.giftedjewelry.com/56562.html
[02:25:20] <Kingsy> the jcarousel doesnt work in IE7 but does in FF
[02:25:57] <Kingsy> http://www.qpjewellers.com/16562.html is a direct copy which works in both browsers (same code as far as I can see)
[02:26:01] <Kingsy> Cork ^^^
[02:26:54] <Cork> Kingsy: where are you calling the jcarousel code?
[02:27:25] <Kingsy> Cork: http://pastie.org/3014930 <-- its called in   custom.js with that function I pastied there
[02:28:40] <Snowman23> http://codepad.viper-7.com/9vsZfu In this example, I want to make it so that when you press "enter" while focused on an input, POST will contain "Go!", however, the current code makes "CLEAR" in there instead. I assumed my JS should work, stop propogation of the "enter" event, and instead just emulate clicking on the input box, but it doesn't. Anyone point me in the right direction?
[02:30:28] <johnline3> is it worthwhile these days making sprites for small (but many images) on a page?
[02:31:05] <johnline3> to bring down the numbers of http requests, or do most servers have keep alive connections
[02:31:14] <crab> johnline3: if you have enough traffic, yes.
[02:31:16] <Spadeski> Hey if I have some simple code can someone make it a plugin ?
[02:31:43] <johnline3> the images should remain static, i'll leave room on the sheet for adding more
[02:31:51] <Cork> Kingsy: its the calculations for .pCarouselWrapper > ul that fails badly
[02:31:53] <edgardo> johnline3, I'm using a sprite for the first time ever in my current project, and may never go back.. no matter what the size of the project :)
[02:32:06] <crab> many small images is a troublesome case.
[02:32:14] <johnline3> edgardo, sometimes to content changes regularly though
[02:32:15] <Cork> Kingsy: width: 4860px; left: -720px
[02:32:28] <TJMonk> that part looks fine Cork
[02:32:30] <Cork> Kingsy: "that ain't right" :)
[02:32:40] <Kingsy> Cork: yeah I noticed that but I cant see WHY.. it works in FF, the qp example I gave you works in both, as far as I can see its the same code on both sites.
[02:32:41] <johnline3> http://johnline.bastage.net/dev/portfolio/ this is the site im thinking of doing it to
[02:32:42] <TJMonk> Where i see an issue is the carousel file, like 247
[02:32:46] <Cork> no if i reset those to sain values it works
[02:32:56] <IvanKuzev> Snowman23:you may have trouble with default behavior and two submit buttons
[02:32:57] <TJMonk> where jquery is returning a width of 1419px for the li's
[02:33:01] <johnline3> if i make a png sheet with the thumbs, that should optimise any blank white space on the img
[02:33:11] <Snowman23> IvanKuzev: Indeed I do have trouble, hence why I'm trying to override it :P
[02:33:15] <IvanKuzev> Snowman23: make the clear type=reset
[02:33:20] <Kingsy> Cork: yeah I managed to do that manually too .. I just cant see a fix
[02:33:37] <Cork> me nether
[02:33:38] <Kingsy> because changing the js file would surely break it in FF
[02:33:44] <Snowman23> Thats not going to work for my purposes, IvanKuzev. This is just the front end form for some app code, the button does a lot more than clear the form, it needs to do a full POST
[02:33:50] <Cork> Kingsy: its the plugin that can't handle ie
[02:34:11] <Cork> simplest solution is to find another or build one yourself
[02:34:11] <TJMonk> Kingsy: try changing line 247 from "li.css({width: li.width(), height: li.height()});" to "li.css({width: width(li), height: height(li)});"
[02:34:13] <Kingsy> Cork: it does on http://www.qpjewellers.com/16562.html
[02:34:17] <Cork> a carusell isn't hard to do
[02:34:22] <IvanKuzev> Snowman23: try this.prevent default?
[02:34:33] <Kingsy> TJMonk: k 1 sec
[02:34:48] <Snowman23> IvanKuzev: Sorry, I'm not too good with Javascript. Is this Javascript or jQuery, or what? Could you point me to some docs on it?
[02:35:01] <IvanKuzev> ?preventDefault\
[02:35:02] <bot-t> IvanKuzev, event.preventDefault() - If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:35:14] <Kingsy> TJMonk: are you kidding me? you fixed it!!!
[02:35:16] <edgardo> johnline3, well if the site is simple with next to no graphics / small icons then it's useless I guess. But I find it to be very handy to have every piece of graphic in one file.. you never have to look for the right file :D
[02:35:36] <Snowman23> Thanks IvanKuzev, I'll take a look
[02:35:41] <TJMonk> thats twice jquery has been giving erroreous widths today for me
[02:35:46] <TJMonk> idk why
[02:36:03] <TJMonk> had a problem on my project, i worked around it, but its weird
[02:36:07] <Kingsy> umm its weird tho..
[02:36:08] <Snowman23> IvanKuzev: Hmm, uh, which element would I bind that too? Is enter being submit part of the form object or what?
[02:36:14] <Cork> Kingsy: time to sit down and look through what css ruls apply to the carousel and its parents then
[02:36:32] <dirkpennings> Cork: regarding keyboard input, why is it that events deliver different "e.which" codes? I made a page which registers inputs: http://handighandig.nl/tests/key-events.html
[02:36:33] <Cork> Kingsy: if it works on the other site, it means it has to be that or the js
[02:36:58] <dirkpennings> regarding that page, when I type a number on my keyboard or through numpad, it delivers different results..
[02:37:00] <IvanKuzev>  e.stopPropagation(); after that e.preventDefault(); try and see if any good comes of it
[02:37:24] <Snowman23> Ah, I see
[02:37:26] <Cork> dirkpennings: charCode and keyCode
[02:37:34] <Kingsy> TJMonk: answer my this though, that change to the file fixed it, but on the working example (the qp link) line 247 of the jcarousel is still     li.css({width: li.width(), height: li.height()});
[02:37:38] <AdvoWork> If I have a table called table-gen2, and i've got multiple table rows, each with an incrementing id,ie <tr id="1"> <tr id="2"> is there a way I can count how many of those rows exist, and for each of those can i pull 2 values from 2 text fields within it? with id's "test" and "test2"?
[02:38:03] <Snowman23> IvanKuzev: http://codepad.viper-7.com/UdLjcD Same behaviour, unfortunatly
[02:38:08] <johnline3> i like the idea of even large imgs being loaded
[02:38:13] <Kingsy> TJMonk: not li.css({width: width(li), height: height(li)});  , so with that shouldnt that be breaking in IE7 ?
[02:38:26] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork: not a good idea to have multiple elements with same id
[02:38:31] <Cork> AdvoWork: i would sugest to skipp the id's
[02:38:47] <Cork> AdvoWork: use .index or the tr and you should have all you need
[02:38:48] <Kingsy> Cork: ah, so it could be the css is slightly different on the carousel
[02:38:55] <TJMonk> Kingsy: i really dont know, but if you hard refresh (ctrl-f5) the js will show properly on the other page as well
[02:39:24] <Cork> Kingsy: no more likly the parents to the carousel, so the carousel js counts wrong
[02:39:31] <Cork> Kingsy: as the wrong css is inline
[02:39:55] <Kingsy> TJMonk: yeah it works on both pages now anyways.. I don't have ie9 could you check both links in ie9 for me? just to confirm we have a fix
[02:40:24] <TJMonk> Cork: I just think its weird i just had a problem with jQuery's width that i had to work around as well, tho is was significantly different
[02:40:34] <TJMonk> Kingsy: sure, one sec
[02:40:36] <Kingsy> Cork: well it looks as though TJMonk's fix smacked it into shape :)
[02:40:44] <Cork> Kingsy: never tried it in ie9, but it works in ie8
[02:41:28] <TJMonk> Kingsy: both pages look good in ie9
[02:41:45] <Kingsy> TJMonk: your a total legend m8
[02:41:47] <Kingsy> thanks
[02:41:54] <TJMonk> np :)
[02:42:23] <Kingsy> man o man, what a bastard plague of an issue
[02:42:53] <Kingsy> TJMonk: just out of curiousity, how did you debug that so fast? do you use a tool to do it? or just firebug?
[02:43:16] <TJMonk> Kingsy: IE9's dev console
[02:43:26] <AdvoWork> IvanKuzev, ahh ok noted. i need to be able to add rows to this table, so there could be loads of these fields in that table, i need to get each one..
[02:43:28] <Kingsy> man I don't have ie9, its decent?
[02:43:32] <TJMonk> its a little wacky, but if you get used to it, its right up there with firebug
[02:43:42] <VictorCL> I need to open a popup in a lightbox , what's a good plugin for this¿
[02:43:44] <TJMonk> yea, it can render pages as ie7, 8 or 9
[02:43:45] <Cork> Kingsy: no, and that makes it even more impressive :)
[02:43:59] <Kingsy> Cork: lol
[02:44:00] <Cork> TJMonk: actually it doens't
[02:44:06] <Kingsy> TJMonk: cool
[02:44:14] <TJMonk> Cork: in what way?
[02:44:17] <Cork> you have rendering differences between ie9 in legacy mode
[02:44:30] <Cork> and the real ie8 7 and so on
[02:44:33] <AdvoWork> I've got: <button type="button" name="test" id="test" >test </button> and $("#test").button().click(function(){});  but nothing happens, is there anything wrong with that syntax? firebug isnt showing anythng
[02:44:36] <TJMonk> Cork: true, for non-well formed code
[02:44:45] <Cork> for well formed code too
[02:44:50] <TJMonk> Cork: for code that validates, and with a reset.css I never see any differences
[02:45:06] <Cork> i have
[02:45:13] <edgardo> i would remove the button() ... right?
[02:45:15] <Cork> its not common, but it happens
[02:45:18] <TJMonk> Cork: But, i don't compare them side by side that often, just when a client complains heh
[02:45:26] <edgardo> I think jquery knows it's a button :)
[02:45:43] <TJMonk> Cork: I completely believe that, its just rare enough that it hasn't caused me any problems
[02:45:52] <AdvoWork> Cork, don't suppose you have an example, or an url for that with the index?
[02:46:15] <Cork> you prob haven't had clients thats picky enough (pixel perfect)
[02:46:23] <Kingsy> well, TJMonk, Cork, I reall y appreciate your help.. thanks
[02:46:45] <TJMonk> Kingsy: np :)
[02:46:53] <TJMonk> Cork: Thankfully, they are not the usual for me heh
[02:47:09] <Cork> meneither now days
[02:47:12] <Cork> thankfully
[02:48:12] <risky_s> hi
[02:48:39] <risky_s> I am trying to replace a <p> element with a input textbox however it seems to nest inside the <p> instead of replace
[02:49:02] <risky_s> i am doing $('.p_box').html('<input ....
[02:49:16] <Cork> ?.replaceWith @ risky_s
[02:49:17] <bot-t> risky_s, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[02:50:13] <johnline3> http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/dumb+Bitch_76806d_3017106.jpg
[02:50:14] <risky_s> cheers working now
[02:50:15] <Snowman23> Ah, my apologies, your preventDefault worked perfectly, IvanKuzev
[02:50:28] <Snowman23> I accidently didn't notice because I had a syntax error in the page I was testing on. Many thanks, IvanKuzev :D
[02:52:14] <IvanKuzev> Snowman23: what.,..are you thanking me for?,....had a lot of work hard to follow
[02:53:08] <Snowman23> 21:37:00 < IvanKuzev>  e.stopPropagation(); after that e.preventDefault(); try and see if any good comes of it
[02:54:04] <Snowman23> IvanKuzev: Well, even if you don't remember, you helped me, and I'm grateful, so thank you :)
[02:54:20] <IvanKuzev> :)
[02:55:04] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork:http://jsfiddle.net/gQaZg/ look at this it may.or may not help you
[02:56:17] <AdvoWork> IvanKuzev, , this is what im trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/4fzDz/ be able to get the quantity and price for both (but there can be loads in there potentially)
[02:56:43] * IvanKuzev is looking
[03:00:40] <Kingsy> Cork: how did you spot the deadlink on kingsy.co.uk? what tool did you use?
[03:03:45] * IvanKuzev finished looking
[03:03:58] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork:http://jsfiddle.net/4fzDz/2/ check this
[03:04:31] <IvanKuzev> Kingsy: the F12 tool in chrome can do it
[03:04:59] <Kingsy> IvanKuzev: thanks
[03:07:12] <Kingsy> brb
[03:12:09] <prodn> WHen you load somehting with AJAX, the javascripts already loaded wont work on the AJAX:ed file. How to work around this?
[03:12:48] <IvanKuzev> 2 ways...1 add new events on the ajaxed elements
[03:13:00] <IvanKuzev> 2 ...look up how to use live events
[03:13:05] <IvanKuzev> ?live
[03:13:15] <IvanKuzev> ?.live
[03:13:21] <prodn> ?.live()
[03:13:27] <edgardo> shouldn't you use .on nowadays?
[03:13:33] <astropirate> i think the robots are down
[03:14:00] <AdvoWork> IvanKuzev, that works, but what about if there are 100 rows, can that be done sort of dynamically?
[03:14:14] <prodn> IvanKuzev: can't you include files and re-run them again when you load a new element with ajax?
[03:15:02] <prodn> when I get something with AJAX, and want to use my PHP-functions on them, I simply do include("function.php"); with PHP. Isn't there something similar in jQuery?
[03:15:05] <IvanKuzev> you can make a custom function that add all events...but its better to use option 2
[03:15:51] <prodn> What if I don't add _all_ events. I just want to add one file, and then I instead make a better file-structure
[03:17:19] <prodn> IvanKuzev: never mind. I just read live() and it makes alot of sense. Do I use it exactly like $.bind() ?
[03:18:02] <IvanKuzev> prodn: i cant answer...havent been there yet
[03:18:21] <ndss56> everyone uses .bind(). is it some new fad?
[03:18:50] <AdvoWork> IvanKuzev, was that to me, about the custom function?
[03:19:29] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork:nope
[03:19:30] <EdwardIII> hey
[03:19:58] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork: well you get the id from a variable ...yes?
[03:20:24] <EdwardIII> is there something builtin to jQuery which means i could create a callback to execute when this is loaded? http://www.buildinternet.com/project/supersized/docs.html
[03:22:15] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork:http://jsfiddle.net/4fzDz/3/ here is how will it work with thousands of rows
[03:22:25] <ravenzz> is there a better way to do this? http://pastie.org/3015164 or is it just fine as it is?
[03:22:52] <IvanKuzev> ravenzz this is fine
[03:23:10] <Milos> this is akward
[03:23:14] <Milos> in an ajax call
[03:23:37] <Milos> I have statusCode: 200: function() { return true; } but I need the parent function to return true
[03:23:41] <Milos> not the anonymous one...
[03:23:57] <Milos> and I don't want to use global variables because I find that haxk
[03:23:58] <Milos> hacky *
[03:24:25] <Milos> I tried not using an anonymous function but that caused errors
[03:26:20] <IvanKuzev> Milos:try not to do that.the ajax function ends god know when..you cant wait for it in the parent function
[03:26:37] <Milos> damn
[03:26:57] <Milos> because I have a function called windowExists(wid) which checks in the database if said window exists, and should return true/false accordingly
[03:27:21] <Milos> but really that indicates that I have to wait for it.
[03:28:09] <IvanKuzev> you can make it call some function like windowCreated() in the ajax callback
[03:28:31] <Milos> well I'm checking if the window exists before calling the windowCreated you see
[03:28:38] <Milos> oh
[03:28:40] <Milos> I get you
[03:30:00] <Dev78> anyone use drupal here?
[03:30:11] <zairakai> Hi all.
[03:30:18] <zairakai> I have a bug.
[03:30:44] <Milos> submit to the bug tracker then
[03:31:16] <zairakai> I have a link in a div like that : <div class="next"><a href="..."><img src="..."></a></div>
[03:32:00] <zairakai> and for the link wich are in div class next/previous I don't want to follow the link, so I put a return false when a click on that was detected
[03:32:31] <zairakai> but when I ckick on I have an another function which can't turn on because the return false.
[03:32:44] <zairakai> Have you an Idea?
[03:33:07] <mikunos> hi guys I'm using the flowplayer in my pages in order to show the flv videos and I'm using a link like this <a href="/documents/wiki/video1.flv">Video</a> but when I click on that link the dimensions of the square where the video must be showed is not resized. The link disappear and with firebug I can see the <object> created correctly by the flowplayer. Then I have set the "A" style with the display block and height e
[03:33:20] * IvanKuzev is going back to work
[03:33:37] * IvanKuzev answers only on pm now..and if its urgent
[03:35:47] <mikunos> any suggestion?
[03:35:57] <sente> mikunos: can you link an example of this?
[03:36:38] <mikunos>  sente on pvt
[03:37:18] <yan_nick> hey guys, how can i change the selected option in a select list in a way that $('select').change(...); will be executed?
[03:38:29] <EdwardIII> yan_nick: maybe you can call .change(); afterwards?
[03:38:36] <EdwardIII> yan_nick: docs should confirm that
[03:40:29] <yan_nick> EdwardIII: ah it did work....cachign fail
[03:40:49] <EdwardIII> i've got an element being inserted into the dom by a 3rd party script. when this element is added i want to do an action (change the font on it using cufon) - is there something i can hook onto to do this? i tried $('#element-being-inserted').ready(function(){ ...}); but no joy
[03:41:05] <Xotix> I have a table.  and in a td i got an <a> with a class. How do i get it?It is sourrounded by id's and classes. How does this matter?i can get it if it is outside of the table.
[03:41:09] <EdwardIII> can i do a dispatch/listener or something to get triggered when the element is shown perhaps?
[03:42:39] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: There are DOM change events but they are not supported in most browsers.
[03:43:02] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: you'll have to do something lame like check every 0.5 seconds if it's there yet
[03:43:30] <EdwardIII> quicksilver: hrm, what about this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2967332/jquery-plugin-for-event-driven-architecture
[03:44:00] <EdwardIII> alternatively, the thing added the element is jQuery supersized. i've looked at their docs but i can't find a callback for when it's complete... is there something built in i can use?
[03:44:02] <Mech0z> Will a id.click event not work if the jquery is loaded on page load and the element with the id is loaded async afterwards?
[03:44:08] <EdwardIII> something common in most jquery stuff?
[03:44:45] <Anime> anyone knows a slider element from scratch tutorial available? i'm only finding plugin ones or image sliders. what i want is the basic [=====o==] thingie, not he content/carousel like slider
[03:47:25] <TJMonk> Anime: Did you look at the jQuery UI Slider?
[03:47:42] <TJMonk> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[03:47:44] <Xotix> Im trying to do $(class). class is somewhere nested. Why does this not work? It is in a generated table but why should it matter?
[03:48:57] <Anime> yeah, but i wanted to learn first on how to make one before. i could even use the jquery ui one, but i dont like using stuff i dont know how they work :p
[03:50:28] <IvanKuzev> Anime: you have to position the handle(relative) to its original place...and there is the matter of setting selected area div..and some other things
[03:51:09] <IvanKuzev> Anime:one day work if you use the widget factory ...more if you dont
[03:51:54] <Anime> hm..
[03:53:00] <IvanKuzev> Anime:wanna waste some time on a carousel plugin with me?

[04:07:08] <IvanKuzev> if you want to help. go ahead its public project(atleast i want it to be)
[04:09:16] <AdvoWork> IvanKuzev, do you know your example: http://jsfiddle.net/4fzDz/3/  do you know with that, if its possible that i basically can count the number of elements(so the number of rows with those inputs (say 2 in this case), and from that basically store that information in an array or similar, so that ive got array[0]['price_quantity'] = 1000;array[0]['price'] = 12; array[1]['price_quantity'] = 2000;array[1]['price'] = 15;  get me?
[04:10:10] <Spadeski> IvanKuzev:  Know any devolopers thats sold/selling products online ?

[04:13:01] <ryan00712> I am trying to simulate the same image popup result as google images page..
[04:13:07] <ipalaus_> ahhh
[04:13:12] <ipalaus_> then i don't know
[04:13:14] <ipalaus_> contact them :P
[04:13:16] <ryan00712> but in the process the table gets rearranged
[04:13:40] <ryan00712> how can I get image popup effect as that of images.google.com
[04:13:47] <eugenmayer> guys, when i have a ul /li list with events (click ) on some elemnts inside and i do something like this: $('somewheretocopyto).append($('wrapper').html()) … are the events "lost" ( so not applied? (jq 1.3)
[04:14:42] <AdvoWork> IvanKuzev, nothing yet, all i have is whats on there. I've found alert($('table#table-gen2 input[name=price_quantity]').val());  which works, so i can get the value for that field, but not for the row, Can i count the number of rows with a certain name? if so, I can then somehow use that example there, to loop through?
[04:17:32] <Zogot> whats the button activating that alert?
[04:17:43] <Zogot> place it next to that input, and use .sibling
[04:23:04] <AdvoWork> hmm, ive got a table, within it ive got 2 rows, both with name price_break_row, example: <tr id="2" class="rowb" name="price_break_row"> I'm doing: var row_count = $('select[name="price_break_row"]').length;  and its showing as 0?? even thouigh theres 2 rows. any ideas please?
[04:23:48] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: a "tr" is not a "select" ?
[04:25:54] <Biomech> anyone know if AWstats records hits on files that contain only a php header redirect?
[04:26:24] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork: FOR EACH ROW YOU MAY USE $('tr#'+rowid+ 'input[name=price_quantity]').val()    if you get rowid dynamicly
[04:27:10] <rythmic> Hi! can someone tell me what a $self.data("ready") implies  and how do I get into that "ready" state. where the var $self = $(this)
[04:29:33] <Mech0z> If I have  <input id="nowbutton" type='button' value="Now" name="@cssid" /> how do I with jquery select the name? var guid = $(this).attr("name"); dont work on a click event on the button
[04:30:21] <IvanKuzev> $('nowbutton').attr("name")
[04:30:29] <IvanKuzev> $('#nowbutton').attr("name") sorry
[04:30:47] <chetane> I think he wants to get it from 'this'
[04:31:05] <Xotix> hi
[04:31:20] <IvanKuzev> it shoud work. but check what is THIS in the debugger
[04:31:24] <Cork> Mech0z: your could try prop
[04:32:07] <Cork> (that is .prob("name") instead of .attr("name")
[04:32:09] <Cork> )
[04:32:22] <Xotix> im using datatables. it generates me a table and i need to get soem elements from that table by their class. i can't because the generated stuff isn't tdone when the other code gets caclled. everything is in ready. How can i make sure, the datatables is really finished?
[04:33:05] <eugenmayer> how would you guys debug events? I want to know which click-handler an element has / runs
[04:33:06] <Mech0z> Cork: has no method prop
[04:35:12] <IvanKuzev> eugenmayer: you can put 'debugger;' line and wait for the debugger to stop there
[04:35:51] <chetane> Mech, your code should work... the issue might be elsewhere
[04:36:44] <Cork> Mech0z: ah, your running an older version of jquery?
[04:36:57] <eugenmayer> IvanKuzev: then you gotta know _where_ to put it :)
[04:37:04] <Mech0z> Cork: 1.5.1
[04:37:32] <Cork> it should have prop...
[04:37:36] <Cork> ?.prop
[04:37:37] <bot-t> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[04:37:43] <Cork> AH
[04:37:45] <Cork> 1.6
[04:37:51] <techouse> i got a situation where i have to remove a JS in order to make the page work in IE8 and less so i was thinking, since it can't be done with the classic if IE hack, is there a way for jquery to find e.g. <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.min.js"></script> so that i can then use .html to add the conflicting <script src="js/conflicting.js"></script>?
[04:38:28] <chetane> Mech0z: try this http://pastebin.com/aAbHEqLJ
[04:38:29] <Cork> Mech0z: could you pb your code snippet?
[04:38:33] <prodn> IvanKuzev: hi agian. $.live() doesn't work for what I want it seems. I do $("input").click(function(){...}); but it only affecs the inputs already loaded. When I retrieve new inputs with AJAX, the function wont trigger on those.
[04:39:05] <Spadeski> prodn You get a fix for that please do share
[04:39:12] <guy> I want to trigger event keyup and pass e.keyCode 13. How to do that?
[04:39:19] <noaXess> how do i use two jquery version side by side? i have a master one.. and a second one, that is used in special case..
[04:39:23] <prodn> Spadeski: it's a common issue?
[04:39:31] <Cork> prodn: that does sound like a perfect fitt for what live fixes
[04:39:38] <Mech0z> this is my this value http://i40.tinypic.com/1fic82.png
[04:39:59] <Cork> ?.noConflict @ noaXess
[04:40:00] <bot-t> noaXess, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[04:40:11] <EdwardIII> hrm, this still seems to be hiding the element .page_control? $j('#page_content_wrapper').children(':not(.page_control)').fadeOut();
[04:40:28] <Cork> noaXess: it will return the object of the old $, safe that as "old_jQuery" or something
[04:40:35] <prodn> Cork: I agree live works "for the future", but only on the loaded elements. If I create new elements afterwards live does not apply to them. Or are you saying this is just what it should do?
[04:40:56] <Spadeski> prodn no but It doesnt seem to work for me eaith
[04:41:02] <Cork> prodn: that's exactly what live is meant to do
[04:41:08] <noaXess> Cork: do i need change anything on old calls for old verions.. i call them with $(....)
[04:41:16] <Spadeski> Will .bind fix that ?
[04:41:24] <Cork> prodn: live adds the event listner on body, and the filters on event.target
[04:41:33] <eugenmayer> guys, $('some').data('event') works with "guid" …but how to find out the corresponding handler?
[04:41:37] <Cork> prodn: so if the element existed when you bound or not ,doesn't matter
[04:41:39] <prodn> Cork: I definitly works for the set elements. When I $.clone() that element, it does not work on the new element.
[04:41:43] <AdvoWork> I've got: <button type="button" name="test" id="test" >test </button> and $("#test").button().click(function(){});  but nothing happens, is there anything wrong with that syntax? firebug isnt showing anythng
[04:41:55] <Spadeski> EyesIsServer:  .parent()
[04:41:57] <Spadeski> shit
[04:41:59] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: yes.
[04:42:03] <noaXess> Cork: to explain deeper.. have jquery 1.4 wich i can't upgrade in the moment... so the whole web use it.. and i need 1.6 for a special call..
[04:42:04] <Spadeski> eugenmayer: .parent()
[04:42:06] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: what is that .button(). part for?
[04:42:10] <Mech0z> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/TSTnU/
[04:42:16] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: just $('#test').click(...)
[04:42:22] <Cork> AdvoWork: you will have to replace the id when you clone an element, id's has to be uniq
[04:42:33] <Cork> quicksilver: jquery-ui
[04:42:53] <Mech0z> http://jsfiddle.net/TSTnU/1/
[04:43:00] <eugenmayer> eugenmayer: ?
[04:43:42] <prodn> $("button").live("click",function(){alert("HELLO")}); Cork . This function works on every <button> I have, but if I $.clone() the <button>, it wont work on the new one, or should it?
[04:44:00] <dean[w]> Stupid question regarding remove. I have a jQuery object which references a certain section of the DOM from my page. I want to remove elements inside of that. e.g. I have var obj = $("#myid") and I want to then remove all elements with class .signature from obj
[04:44:07] <quicksilver> Cork: Ah. right :)
[04:44:13] <dean[w]> and return them.
[04:44:17] <Cork> prodn: as i said, if you add it to the dom again, yes it should
[04:44:26] <Kingsy> why does console.log(jQuery(document).height()); return e.body is null ?
[04:44:46] <eugenmayer> ok. Got it.
[04:45:53] <prodn> Cork: what do you mean by adding it "again". Should I re-load the script or what?
[04:46:23] <Cork> prodn: .clone just creates a clone in variable, it doesn't add it to the dom
[04:46:45] <Cork> you need to append/html/prepend/... it back to the dom
[04:46:54] <IvanKuzev> Kingsy:cant say it runs on jsfiddle
[04:47:35] <prodn> Cork: yes ofcourse. I can see the new button on the webpage so it's definitly in the dom...how else could I try to click it and notice taht the function does not kick in? :)
[04:47:55] <AdvoWork> hmm, now got: <button type="button" name="test_price_breaks" id="test_price_breaks" >test get price breaks</button> and  $('#test_price_breaks').click(function(){alert("test");}); but it still does nothing
[04:48:15] <Spadeski> prodn alert();
[04:48:38] <Cork> Mech0z: how are you calling setDateTimeToNow?
[04:50:50] <Cork> prodn: http://jsfiddle.net/jA6pe/
[04:50:51] <Mech0z> Cork: I changed it so I parse my GUID as a parameter instead
[04:51:12] <AdvoWork> how come http://jsfiddle.net/eFkW4/ wont work then, ive done what you suggested quicksilver , but still nothing
[04:51:13] <IvanKuzev> which function to use to select..siblings and me
[04:51:14] <prodn> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/5yLC4/ yes I just tried it too
[04:51:42] <Cork> Mech0z: ya, you need to either pass the function as a reference to a callback, or use apply/call on it so you set the this varaible
[04:52:14] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork: wrong framework
[04:52:15] <Cork> Mech0z: the way you add that function it doesn't have a this variable, so it just points to window
[04:53:06] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: your code is fine. You have to load jquery for it to work.
[04:53:14] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: (menu on the left of jsfiddle)
[04:54:00] <Mech0z> Cork:  okay that makes sense
[04:54:30] <nFFF> jQuer(this).prev(label)
[04:54:41] <nFFF> Isn't selecting, the parents sibling label
[04:55:02] <nFFF> Have an element, that when clicked needs to select it's parents' sibling label
[04:55:09] <nFFF> What can I use to do such a thing
[04:55:29] <nFFF> Or at least, just select the previous <label regardless of relationship
[04:55:35] <Cork> nFFF: jQuery.parnet().prevAll('label')
[04:55:49] <prodn> Cork: Ok sorry for the mess eariler. I noticed my problem. I stated a $.each() before $.live(). It's here: http://jsfiddle.net/5yLC4/4/ can you look it out?
[04:56:00] <Cork> nFFF: next/prev only selects in the same child area
[04:56:07] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, i have jquery loaded in my own code though, and i use it for lots of things
[04:56:32] <Cork> prob: uh... you loop around the live click ? :D
[04:56:38] <Cork> thats kinda pointless :)
[04:57:11] <prodn> Cork: ?
[04:57:19] <Cork> prob: you should always use a text selector for live
[04:57:31] <Cork> its pointless with live if you bind it to an object id
[04:57:42] <Cork> or rather element id
[04:58:03] <eugenmayer> is there a more "clone" like method to copy html instead html() ? so also cloning events and so forth
[04:58:05] <Cork> put the live outside the loop and bind it to $("button").live
[04:58:24] <prodn> Cork: what I really am doing is that I put down a clone of two <select>ts which have a set of options to an item. When you want to add one more item, the
[04:58:30] <Cork> ?.clone @ eugenmayer
[04:58:30] <bot-t> eugenmayer, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[04:58:31] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, if i put it in my external .js file it doesnt work, if i put it in my html page, it does?
[04:58:38] <Cork> eugenmayer: check the parameter :)
[04:58:39] <prodn> the two selects interact with each other based on their id
[04:58:52] <nFFF> Cork, thanks, the only problem is, due to the CMS (magento) that we are using, sometimes the previous label is a sibling and sometimes its a aprents' sibling
[04:58:52] <prodn> so they get new ids on every clone
[04:59:06] <nFFF> Is there anyway to just select the previous label
[04:59:10] <eugenmayer> bot-t: ++! Thank you
[04:59:12] <bot-t> eugenmayer, jQuery.getJSON() - Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[04:59:13] <Cork> nFFF: you will have to combind two selectors then
[04:59:14] <prodn> and I want the function to work for each
[04:59:15] <nFFF> Im guessing jQuery.parnet().prevAll('label') won't work if the label is a sibling
[04:59:18] <eugenmayer> lol. Sorry Cork.
[04:59:21] <eugenmayer> Cork++
[04:59:22] <eugenmayer> :)
[04:59:34] <Cork> nFFF: offcource
[04:59:55] <Spadeski> Can someone help me figure our why .idle does not trigger after 3 seconds http://pastebin.com/RZUnuP1s
[05:00:10] <xec> jQuery.parnet() ??
[05:00:33] <dean[w]> http://pastebin.com/DLx2WEh0 <-- How can I select everything inside of .post *except* for p.signature? I am only interested in the raw html, nothing else
[05:00:35] <Cork> nFFF: jQuery().prevAll('label').add(jQuery().parnet().prevAll('label'))
[05:00:58] <Cork> nFFF: and don't forget to grab the last one in the resulting array
[05:01:11] <Cork> result.eq(result.length)
[05:01:17] <Cork> opps
[05:01:19] <Cork> result.eq(result.length - 1)

[05:01:25] <Spadeski> Can someone help me figure our why .idle does not trigger after 3 seconds http://pastebin.com/RZUnuP1s
[05:01:48] <eugenmayer> Cork: how to "insert" a dom object. html() seems to only support strings and i cant use appendTo or similar
[05:01:51] <Cork> prodn: if you bind them to each uniq element, live is completly pointless
[05:02:16] <Cork> eugenmayer: see ?.append and see ?.prepend and see ?.insertAfter
[05:02:16] <bot-t> eugenmayer, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[05:02:17] <bot-t> eugenmayer, .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[05:02:17] <bot-t> eugenmayer, .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[05:02:30] <xec> Spadeski: check what "this" is inside your userIdle function
[05:02:55] <Spadeski> xec Cant doesnt trigger at all just .active
[05:03:03] <Cork> prodn: only way for live to do something usefull is through a generic selector
[05:03:22] <Cork> prodn: so you have to construct your events in a way where they have a variable with the uniq info in them
[05:03:29] <eugenmayer> Cork: hmm, let me give an example $('<div id="foo"><div>).html($(somehting).clone());
[05:03:31] <xec> Spadeski: doesnt your userIdle function execute?
[05:03:35] <Cork> prodn: .data is a good solution for that
[05:03:43] <Spadeski> xec Not at all
[05:03:56] <eugenmayer> Cork: will result in <div id="foo"><….cloned dom html…></div>
[05:04:04] <Cork> ya
[05:04:17] <Cork> eugenmayer: the alternatives is linked to above
[05:04:19] <eugenmayer> Cork: so iam searching for "insert into" rather then all the methods you have, me, dont i?
[05:04:21] <eugenmayer> hmm
[05:04:27] <eugenmayer> (i must be blind, looking again)
[05:04:38] <Cork> <bot-t> eugenmayer,
[05:04:42] <Cork> three times :)
[05:05:32] <eugenmayer> Cork: what i mean, neither append, after, insertAfter "inserts".
[05:05:35] <eugenmayer> (into)
[05:05:56] <Cork> yes append and prepend does
[05:06:08] <Cork> after and before doen't
[05:06:25] <Spadeski> xeec Wierd right
[05:06:33] <Spadeski> xec*
[05:06:50] <xec> Spadeski: i think you misunderstood me
[05:06:56] <Spadeski> Oh
[05:07:18] <eugenmayer> Cork: to explain it plainly: Iam stupid and blind
[05:07:25] <eugenmayer> Thank makes a effective combination...
[05:07:28] <xec> 2 sec, making demo
[05:07:49] <eugenmayer> Cork: sorry, thank you for pointing me
[05:07:55] <Spadeski> xec kk thanks
[05:08:15] <xec> Spadeski: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk6kQ/ <-- copypasted your code, removed the trigger and added an alert
[05:08:33] <Cork> eugenmayer: lol don't swet it :)
[05:08:38] <xec> Spadeski: hover over test and then dont do anything for 3 sec, you should get an alert?
[05:09:15] <Spadeski> I definetely did
[05:09:40] <xec> Spadeski: if you check console after you click OK on alert you'll see what "this" is -- a reference to the global window object
[05:09:44] <Spadeski> xec yeah it does hmmm
[05:10:10] <Spadeski> oh alright
[05:10:46] <Logitec> Hi guys, I have a selector question
[05:11:15] <Logitec> this $('.3').find('td').eq(6); finds -> <td id=​"8" class=​"price">​€ 0.21​</td>​
[05:11:15] <eugenmayer> is there any way to check, out of an event handler, "are there any other handlers to be called after me"
[05:11:36] <Logitec> How do I expand my method extract that id?
[05:12:46] <Cork> Logitec: $('.3 td').eq(6).attr('id') ?
[05:13:01] <Logitec> Ah id is an attribute, of course!
[05:13:04] <Logitec> thanks Cork
[05:13:09] <Cork> np
[05:14:09] <Logitec> Yep, it's returning the ID now, cheers
[05:15:44] <guy> is PUT request basically POST request without response?
[05:16:52] <eugenmayer> guy that is rather no a jq question .)
[05:17:01] <eugenmayer> guy and yes, that it is.
[05:17:04] <Spadeski>  xec Thanks alot man, Wanna test the code you help make, give feedback blah
[05:18:08] <Cork> guy: no
[05:18:20] <guy> Cork: so it is more like GET request without response?
[05:18:24] <Cork> guy: put is a post just with a different http type
[05:18:39] <Cork> its a "faked" type for restfull http services
[05:18:48] <Cork> same with delete
[05:20:43] <xec> Spadeski: sure, did you update the jsfiddle ?
[05:21:02] <nFFF> jQuery(this).parent().prev('label').addClass("changed"); isn't selecting the parents' sibling <label
[05:21:11] <nFFF> any reaosn why?
[05:21:26] <Cork> prev only selects the absolut previus
[05:21:36] <Cork> IF the selector matches that specific element
[05:21:43] <Cork> if it doesn't it doesn't match anything
[05:21:59] <Cork> so selectors on prev is most of the time pointless
[05:22:05] <Cork> you prob want prevAll
[05:22:19] <Cork> what a :last selector
[05:22:22] <Cork> or similar
[05:23:49] <ShishKabab> I need to dynamically construct a table of data in JS. Can anyone recommend me a template language? Or a nicer way to do this?
[05:25:27] <xec> ShishKabab: maybe you could just use a grid plugin? you can find some here: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/35122722/Grid-OtherGrids
[05:26:01] <ravenzz> I have a width of 50px I want to toggle its size and make it wider when I check a checkbox, when I uncheck the checkbox it should be 50px again. suggestions?
[05:26:20] <ravenzz> i have a div*
[05:26:21] <anli_> How do I tell a fullcalendar to refetch its data?
[05:26:34] <anli_> --- Martin Luther King
[05:27:04] <ShishKabab> xec: Yes, that's an idea. Thanks!
[05:28:01] <anli_> Ah, its $('#calendar').fullCalendar('refetchEvents');
[05:30:51] <eugenmayer> ?replaceClass
[05:30:53] <bot-t> eugenmayer, .addClass() - Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[05:31:09] <ravenzz> i wouldn't use presentational markup
[05:31:55] <Cork> eugenmayer: you will have to do two calls
[05:32:05] <Cork> .removeClass().addClass()
[05:32:34] <eugenmayer> hasClass().remove.add
[05:32:35] <eugenmayer> rather
[05:32:43] <Cork> no
[05:32:54] <eugenmayer> Yes. But it depends on your logic
[05:32:58] <Cork> hasClass returns true or false, so you can't chain that
[05:33:03] <eugenmayer> "replace only if"..or "replace in any case"
[05:33:11] <eugenmayer> arg
[05:33:30] <Cork> ?.filter @ eugenmayer
[05:33:31] <bot-t> eugenmayer, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[05:33:35] <eugenmayer> well thats easy with a selector then
[05:34:00] <eugenmayer> thank you once again :)
[05:34:27] <Cork> eugenmayer: another tip use the search engin on http://api.jquery.com
[05:34:40] <eugenmayer> Cork: i did :)
[05:35:12] <eugenmayer> I just forgot about the return value of hasClass as i got always used to the "return this" return values for chaining
[05:38:53] <Hopsy|2> who can help me?

[05:40:33] <rythmic> I am trying to see if a string exists in an h2 element which I use find() to find :)
[05:40:33] <Hopsy|2> Cork: can I make this in jquery and html5? http://www.byturen.com/
[05:40:42] <Cork> rythmic: filter(':contains()') ?
[05:41:10] <Spadeski> Can you use .each() to reload the li's in a list just wondering ?
[05:41:17] <Cork> rythmic: ah then it might be better to just do .text() and match it
[05:41:25] <Cork> is most likly faster
[05:41:55] <rythmic> Cork: how do I do a match then? I'm very new to jquery
[05:42:21] <eugenmayer> Not sure i can do this with "filter", but how woudl e express
[05:42:29] <eugenmayer> "select all td which have a div"
[05:42:46] <rythmic> Cork: text().match("4")  if 4 is what I want to find?
[05:43:11] <Hopsy|2> Cork: ?
[05:43:31] <quicksilver> eugenmayer: 'td:has(div)'
[05:43:36] <eugenmayer> i cant use .has()
[05:43:43] <Cork> rythmic: $parent.find('h2').text().search('text your looking for') > 0
[05:43:45] <eugenmayer> (jquery 1.3)
[05:43:56] <Cork> rythmic: or do you have more then one h2 matched?
[05:44:12] <AdvoWork> How can i access the value of the input field with id price_quantity within a <tr> and <td> if i know the id of the tr? e.g <tr id="2" class="rowb" name="price_break_row"><td class="col1 cell"><input type="text" name="price_quantity" id="price_quantity" class="small_input"   value="2000" />
[05:44:16] <eugenmayer> quicksilver: http://api.jquery.com/has/ is 1.4 only, is :has() available in 1.3?
[05:44:20] <quicksilver> eugenmayer: :has was added in 1.1.4, the docs say.
[05:44:22] <rythmic> Cork: nope, I can select the text I want just fine
[05:44:23] <Cork> Hopsy|2: i don't see whats there to change, it includes youtube
[05:44:27] <quicksilver> eugenmayer: http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[05:44:39] <Cork> Hopsy|2: and youtube isn't posible to include in video tags
[05:44:40] <eugenmayer> sorry, just found it.
[05:44:49] <Cork> Hopsy|2: i don't see anything else thats there
[05:44:55] <Hopsy|2> Cork: hover with your mouse
[05:45:07] <Azrael_-> hi
[05:45:30] <AdvoWork> would it be something like $('tr[name="price_break_row"]' #price_quantity).val?
[05:45:37] <Azrael_-> i use tinymce to allow users to format their text. is it possible to somehow preserve the original linebreaks? atm they are all replaced by <br>
[05:46:03] <Cork> Hopsy|2: yes THAT part is doable
[05:46:15] <Cork> Hopsy|2: simplest is to use svg
[05:46:19] <Cork> (and filters)
[05:46:43] <eugenmayer> using negation would be $('td:not(:has(div))') ?
[05:46:58] <Cork> AdvoWork: what are you trying to do?
[05:49:21] <AdvoWork> Cork, ive tried $('tr[name="price_break_row"] #price_break_quantity').val()  im trying to get the value of the input field price_break_quantity which is positioned in the table row price_break_row. I have multiple rows,(each row has an id) so im trying to say for each row, get the value for the rows id, get me?
[05:49:45] <Cork> AdvoWork: $('#price_break_quantity') ?
[05:49:49] <Cork> its an id after all
[05:50:01] <Cork> it can only exist once
[05:50:17] <Spadeski1> Would this create an infinite loop ?
[05:50:23] <Spadeski1> setInterval(function(){
[05:50:23] <Spadeski1> $('.chat-user').each(function(index) {
[05:50:23] <Spadeski1>    var GUID = $(this).attr("id");
[05:50:23] <Spadeski1>    alert(GUID);
[05:50:23] <Spadeski1> });
[05:50:24] <Spadeski1> }, 1000000);
[05:50:24] <Spadeski1> 	
[05:50:28] <Cork> ...
[05:50:44] <Cork> Spadeski1: don't paste long codes in the channel see ?p
[05:50:44] <Spadeski1> setInterval(function(){
[05:50:44] <Spadeski1> $('.chat-user').each(function(index) {
[05:50:44] <Spadeski1>    var GUID = $(this).attr("id");
[05:50:44] <Spadeski1>    alert(GUID);
[05:50:44] <Spadeski1> });
[05:50:44] <bot-t> Spadeski1, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:50:45] <Spadeski1> }, 1000000);
[05:50:45] <Spadeski1> 	
[05:50:55] <Cork> Spadeski1: watch it
[05:51:26] <AdvoWork> Cork, but there will be multiple of that element, ie: http://jsfiddle.net/VMfFh/
[05:51:40] <Cork> AdvoWork: then you have broken and invalid html
[05:51:51] <Cork> selectors can't deal with it
[05:51:59] <Cork> you will have to treat them as attributes then
[05:52:13] <AdvoWork> Cork, i could i suppose do: id="row_1" type thing, and then as i know 1, i can go price_break_quantity_1 ?
[05:52:17] <Cork>  input[id="price_break_quantity"]
[05:52:32] <Cork> AdvoWork: or use class, as you should be
[05:52:42] <Cork> thsi is a prefect example of what should be a class
[05:52:58] <Cork> *this
[05:54:10] <Spadeski1> Cork Its my browser keeps minimizing tried to copy that too pastebin Im sorry
[05:55:22] <Cork> Spadeski1: just so you know, why, 1) readin load code in irc channels are hard or often close to imposible 2) is spams 907 users with each line of your code, and that can cause them to exceed there queue and disconnect
[05:55:37] <Cork> so its pointless and dangerus/rude
[05:55:51] <Cork> no hard feelings, just be carefull about your pasts
[05:55:54] <Cork> *pastes
[05:56:51] <Cork> uh.. *reading long code... man nice type...
[06:01:26] <Spadeski1> Cork that sucks man like bad lol
[06:01:30] <Spadeski1> http://pastebin.com/uzpR5vYp
[06:02:38] <Cork> Spadeski1: when your use each on a selector, each only take one parameter, and its the callback
[06:03:17] <Spadeski1> Oh How would I call a callback on a function ?
[06:03:32] <Spadeski1> Oh I seee
[06:03:35] <Cork> http://pastebin.com/DpjDL6TK
[06:03:36] <Spadeski1> that arr was typo
[06:03:40] <Cork> opps
[06:03:54] <Cork> man pasebin sucks...
[06:04:07] <Cork> Spadeski1: ok, then whats the question?
[06:04:29] <Spadeski1> That it does, Cork It doesnt do anything no alerts at all What do I do too trigger this ?
[06:05:00] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[06:05:55] <Spadeski1> Just alert all the .chat-users .id's when the page refreshes and do it every 5 seconds
[06:06:33] <Cork> and you absolutly want them each one in its own alert?
[06:06:43] <Cork> well doesn't matter
[06:06:49] <Spadeski1> Yup yup
[06:06:53] <Cork> the part of the code you'r showing should work
[06:07:02] <Cork> so its something else
[06:07:03] <Spadeski1> dang
[06:07:46] <Cork> ex. make sure its wrapped in .ready so the dom is ready for traversing before the event triggers
[06:07:47] <Spadeski1> Cork does it matter if its the third class on a div or no ?
[06:08:01] <Cork> no
[06:08:27] <Spadeski1> Alright brb
[06:08:30] <Cork> you generically selecting eveny element in the document that has the class "chat-user"
[06:08:39] <Spadeski1> Yeah
[06:08:56] <Cork> so as long as the page has finnished loading it should work
[06:09:19] <kborchers> Spadeski1: you are confusing jQuery.each with .each
[06:09:21] <AdvoWork> I'm doing: price_break_details['quantity'][count - 1] = $('#price_break_quantity_' + count).val();  and its giving the error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '0' of undefined. Any idea why? I alert($('#price_break_quantity_' + count).val()) and it has a value, and count is defined as var count = 1;
[06:10:02] <Spadeski1> kborchers Nah I saw both
[06:10:11] <Spadeski1> this one should do same
[06:10:11] <kborchers> Spadeski1: so why are you mixing them
[06:10:31] <kborchers> you don't need the arr in this implementation
[06:11:11] <Spadeski1>  kborchers Im not I said before that was typo still not cause off  problem
[06:11:19] <Spadeski1> :
[06:11:19] <Spadeski1> p
[06:11:21] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork: price_break_details['quantity'] is this defined
[06:12:01] <mazzachre> Is this also the channel to talk jqueryui? And is jqueryui the prefered way of doing widgets?
[06:12:08] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork: you need price_break_details['quantity'] = [] somewhere if its an empty array item
[06:12:15] <Spadeski1> This oddly enough is pissing me
[06:12:17] <Spadeski1> off
[06:12:41] <Cork> Spadeski1: use jsfiddle and reproduce your problem
[06:12:57] <Spadeski1> Cork alright
[06:13:23] <Cork> remember to select the correct settings in the left bar
[06:14:12] <Spadeski1>  Cork with it I would use onDomReady right /
[06:14:14] <Spadeski1> ?*
[06:14:33] <Cork> Spadeski1: you should prob use head if you put your script tags in head
[06:14:49] <Cork> reproduce the same condition your running the code on your page
[06:15:25] <Spadeski1> ah alright
[06:15:59] <IvanKuzev> its more css than jquery but....i have an element with class 'ui-widget-content grayish1'...the grayish is supposed to change bgcolor....it doesnt
[06:16:10] <AdvoWork> IvanKuzev, this is what I try and do http://jsfiddle.net/VMfFh/1/  if ive defined price_break_details as my array, do i still need to define each part of the array?
[06:16:17] <Spadeski1>  Cork aalso doesnt show my HML http://jsfiddle.net/zSyKr/2/
[06:16:20] <Spadeski1> HTML
[06:16:32] <Spadeski1> im dum
[06:16:33] <Spadeski1> lol
[06:17:05] <Spadeski1> Alright http://jsfiddle.net/zSyKr/3/
[06:17:20] <Spadeski1> onDomReady is same as I use
[06:18:50] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork:http://jsfiddle.net/VMfFh/3/
[06:18:53] <Cork> Spadeski1: didn't you say it should go every 5 sec?
[06:18:56] <kborchers> Spadeski1: works fine ... you just have to wait for the interval. i changed to 1000 and it fires every second
[06:19:07] <Cork> the timer is in 15.6 minutes :)
[06:19:11] <Cork> '16.6
[06:19:36] <Spadeski1> Wow
[06:19:47] <Spadeski1> lol I thought it would at least fire once first though
[06:20:08] <Cork> Spadeski1: setTimeout/setInterval waits first trigger later
[06:20:08] <Spadeski1> and I figured ready() was better anyways
[06:20:57] <eugenmayer> is there any way to find out whetere any click-events our bound to on element?
[06:21:21] <Cork> event.clientX ?
[06:21:26] <Spadeski1>  Thanks Cork Finished helped finish my chat :D
[06:21:29] <Cork> and event.clientY
[06:24:07] <eugenmayer> Cork: not rather
[06:24:21] <Cork> sorry?
[06:24:26] <eugenmayer> if('click' in $('sel').data('events')) ?
[06:24:55] <Cork> aha
[06:25:06] <Cork> i though you meant something else
[06:26:51] <IvanKuzev> i need help.. here is a jsfiddle...
[06:26:52] <IvanKuzev> http://jsfiddle.net/9de2s/2/
[06:26:57] <Cork> eugenmayer: if thats what you want i would prob use .data('events').hasOwnProperty('click')
[06:27:31] <eugenmayer> ?hasOwnProperty
[06:27:33] <bot-t> eugenmayer, jQuery.isEmptyObject() - Check to see if an object is empty (contains no properties). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isEmptyObject/
[06:27:44] <eugenmayer> Cork: as i though, > 1.3 :/
[06:28:51] <bubach> Hi, I'm using   var arr = $('#printCargoList :input').serializeArray();   to catch form inputs before posting, but for some reason I only get the checkbox names - and not the values. All values for checkboxes is "", any suggestions? :/
[06:29:02] <kborchers> IvanKuzev: http://jsfiddle.net/9de2s/3/
[06:29:53] <sphinxxx> ivankuzev, use background, not background-color
[06:29:53] <Cork> or http://jsfiddle.net/9de2s/4/ :)
[06:30:14] <Cork> background-color is fine as long as you reset the image :)
[06:30:36] <IvanKuzev> what,,,,still cant get it
[06:30:54] <Cork> IvanKuzev: theres an image overlaying your background color
[06:30:55] <IvanKuzev> oh....i have to remove the bgimage
[06:31:41] <bubach> How can the cehckbox value be discared, but the name included with serializeArray?  I get a GET string like ?checkbox1=&checkbox2=&textInput=text_here
[06:32:19] <Cork> bubach: that is how it should be
[06:32:22] <sshow> Hey! How to select multiple elements using $('selector').eq() ?
[06:32:29] <IvanKuzev> thanx kboochers cork and sphinxxx
[06:33:02] <Cork> sshow: you can store it in a variable and add them to a new selector
[06:33:07] <bubach> Cork: so, eh, how can I get the values? :S  and why would anybody want the checkbox name, and not the accompaning value? :/
[06:33:48] <Cork> bubach: the value should be added if its there
[06:33:53] <sshow> Cork: var eqs = $(sel.eq(0), sel.eq(1)); ?
[06:34:52] <bubach> yeah, well it's not.  I get the names of all checked checkboxes, and not the ones that are left unchecked... values set to "true" btw, is that reserved or some shit? hahah
[06:35:27] <Cork> sshow: no sel.eq(0).add(sel.eq(1)).add().add()
[06:35:39] <sshow> Cork: thanks
[06:37:54] <Cork> bubach: http://jsfiddle.net/hmTzt/
[06:39:47] <Kozie> Hi all ;)
[06:41:11] <bubach> wth, FML.  I use the exact same thing in my code, no values. royally fuck'd
[06:41:35] <Cork> bubach: copy the html your using
[06:41:49] <Cork> (into a the fiddle
[06:41:51] <Cork> )
[06:42:35] <bubach> i'ts kind of complicated for a jsfiddle, but I'll try to make it work in jsfiddle
[06:42:55] <Kozie> can some1 help me with this - http://pastebin.com/94NGGWde
[06:42:58] <Cork> bubach: just built the same form html structure
[06:43:05] <Cork> bubach: i don't think its the js that matter
[06:43:09] <Kozie> See the comment on line 9 - 11
[06:43:41] <dmsuperman> Can I pass an array item number into a selector? I'm trying to avoid doing this: $($('.selector')[2]).etc()
[06:43:49] <dmsuperman> so it's just $('.selector[2]').etc()
[06:44:04] <Cork> Kozie: your not creating a class, your only creating an object, and it does't have this
[06:44:30] <Cork> a class with this needs to be instanciated
[06:44:45] <Cork> (that is var myclass = new myClass(); )
[06:44:49] <Kozie> yeah it's not the whole code @Cork ;) it's eventually a class
[06:45:02] <kborchers> ?eq @ dmsuperman
[06:45:03] <bot-t> dmsuperman, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[06:45:52] <Kozie> the 'this' in 'this._timeoutHandler' is actually myClass.. but i want myClass also in the function in setTimeout
[06:45:56] <Cork> Kozie: well if this works in myMethod, the second problem is that setTimeout creates its own scope, so this inside it points to its scope
[06:45:58] <bubach> LOL, I crach jsFiddle when I paste my form... :/
[06:46:04] <Cork> so you need to store the old this var
[06:46:07] <Kozie> but i want to avoid using a temp scope like var thisObject = this;
[06:46:14] <Kozie> can i do something with .call or .apply ?
[06:46:18] <Cork> there is no other way
[06:46:19] <dmsuperman> kborchers: Ah, thanks :)
[06:46:21] <Cork> no
[06:46:39] <Kozie> hmm
[06:46:50] <Cork> Kozie: settimeout sets the scope, in some brower you can pass it what this should be, but it doesn't work in ie
[06:47:04] <Kozie> that sounds pretty logic.. i was afraid this was not possible tho..
[06:47:07] <dmsuperman> You could setTimeout to an anonymous function which then uses .call passing the correct scope
[06:47:08] <Kozie> Thanks anyway @Corok !
[06:47:13] <Kozie> @Cork, sry ;)
[06:47:14] <Cork> np
[06:47:16] <dmsuperman> Though I don't know the full extent of your problem that may not be applicable
[06:49:32] <Cork> wtf...
[06:49:37] <Cork> >_>
[06:49:40] <Cork> hmm
[06:50:02] * Cork hits his client

[06:58:17] <roowilliams> repeat*
[06:58:18] <Geneller> how can i know the  base root to go there directly ?
[06:59:06] <Geneller> sphinxxx: hi, sorry but i had to write like that to expose my problem
[07:00:20] <sphinxxx> roowilliams, you have height:465px set on the <li> below that <ul>
[07:00:25] <Geneller> basicly is, if this is my root http://desarrollo2/dsig4/conductores/add  how can i get http://desarrollo2/dsig/   ?
[07:00:34] <sphinxxx> what slideshow plugin are you using btw?
[07:00:35] <Geneller> without regexp
[07:01:18] <roowilliams> sphinxxx: that's inline, added by the jquery cycle script
[07:01:22] <roowilliams> i dont know why thogh
[07:01:25] <roowilliams> though*
[07:02:02] <sphinxxx> roowilliams, does the plugin have its own css
[07:02:08] <sphinxxx> file
[07:02:17] <roowilliams> no
[07:03:40] <sphinxxx> i cant really say then
[07:03:45] <sphinxxx> is it causing a problem?
[07:03:45] <roowilliams> thanks for looking
[07:04:06] <roowilliams> it's runing that lovely uniform 20px spacing between the border and the images
[07:04:08] <roowilliams> :)
[07:04:24] <sphinxxx> try giving a css rule to override the height of 465px
[07:04:28] <sphinxxx> and set !important on it
[07:05:19] <roowilliams> ugh hacks, but guess that's the only way i can see to do it
[07:05:20] <roowilliams> cheers
[07:05:24] <roowilliams> i'll give it a go
[07:05:31] <sphinxxx> whats weird is that its only the first <li>
[07:05:34] <sphinxxx> the rest seem to be 460
[07:06:03] <sphinxxx> btw did you use a blank wordpress theme for this?
[07:06:10] <sphinxxx> curious b/c i need to do one soon
[07:06:56] <roowilliams> i built it up using some bits of code i nabbed from twentyten
[07:06:58] <roowilliams> theme
[07:07:20] <roowilliams> but pretty much started from scratch
[07:07:30] <roowilliams> i wanted to understand it and see how it worked
[07:07:39] <sphinxxx> it looks good
[07:07:54] <roowilliams> thanks :)
[07:08:11] <roowilliams> my first dabblings with jquery started y'day evening

[07:08:41] <roowilliams> particularly proud of them i was :D
[07:22:10] <mikunos> hi guys I am trying to solve a common problem for many web designers. Joining the Fancybox and the Flowplayer without frame. This is a code written from sente http://jsfiddle.net/za4BL/22/ and this is mine http://jsfiddle.net/za4BL/20/
[07:22:10] <mikunos> the problem is create a sample way to attaching a flv video file to a href object and show a video in a fancybox.
[07:22:10] <mikunos> Any help?
[07:23:26] <mikunos> In my solution I get a wrong vf value. I get always the first video in a list of 10 flv links
[07:24:08] <mikunos> does anybody help me to solve this problem
[07:24:09] <mikunos> ?
[07:33:49] <jeffsmykil> If I am adding an active state to a button via javascript what function should I use?
[07:33:52] <jeffsmykil> click or mouseDown?
[07:35:18] <risky_s_> hi anyone know about mysql subqueries with arrays?
[07:35:41] <risky_s_> for example (select 0 union all)...?
[07:36:49] <pkiller> hi ppl... i have an idea just i dont know how to make it reality with jquery.
[07:37:16] <BarelyFitz> $(idea).appendTo('body')
[07:37:28] <pkiller> :)
[07:37:48] <jeffsmykil> BarelyFitz: you never defined idea
[07:37:50] <pkiller> i want to put qwebirc inside a box thingy
[07:37:52] <jeffsmykil> you are going to get an error
[07:38:38] <pkiller> and make that box thingy appier and dissapier like facebook chat when you click it... so it stays "open"
[07:39:15] <pkiller> any ideas, suggestions where to go what to search for?
[07:39:53] <jeffsmykil> oi have no idea what qwebirc is
[07:40:09] <pkiller> realy?
[07:40:33] <pkiller> http://qwebirc.org/
[07:41:07] <pkiller> its an ajax web irc client... i think :)
[07:41:48] <jeffsmykil> do you have any javascript experience?
[07:42:17] <pkiller> so i want to make irc... look like facebook chat... (the old one)
[07:42:24] <pkiller> not at all jeffsmykil
[07:42:35] <pkiller> i just want to see if its possible
[07:42:44] <jeffsmykil> it is possible
[07:42:51] <jeffsmykil> you might want to start less ambitious
[07:43:14] <pkiller> for example? :)
[07:43:26] <pkiller> i am open for any preposition :)
[07:44:09] <jeffsmykil> learn javascript
[07:44:53] <jeffsmykil> does the irc client use jquery?
[07:44:58] <jeffsmykil> or is it built off another library?
[07:45:48] <jeffsmykil> pkiller: does it use jquery?
[07:45:56] <pkiller> i dont think so
[07:46:14] <pkiller> i think it uses something different
[07:46:44] <pkiller> i just want to iFrame it in a jquerry box thingy if possible?
[07:47:15] <jeffsmykil> you have a back end for it?
[07:47:35] <pkiller> yes the qwebirc is a server side webchat client ...
[07:47:51] <jeffsmykil> yeah but it needs a perl back end right?
[07:47:57] <pkiller> yep
[07:48:26] <pkiller> not shure if its perl.. just a sec i have to check
[07:49:06] <BarelyFitz> pkiller: so what is your questions - how do you make the box with an iframe at the bottom of the page? or do you need to know how to "keep it open" when you go to a new page?
[07:51:01] <pkiller> 1st i need to know if i can put an Iframe at the bottom of the page... and after that i would need to keep it ipen when you go to a new page and also to be able to "minimize it"
[07:51:42] <pkiller> thats the basic idea... but if its to complex or not doable... i can settle for less...
[07:52:32] <purefusion2> how should I go about hiding content via js without the user seeing a flash of content first?
[07:52:58] <jeffsmykil> purefusion2: why arent you hiding it with CSS?
[07:53:28] <purefusion2> jeffsmykil: because that's not how it should be done, for accessibility sake
[07:53:40] <BarelyFitz> purefusion2: http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/
[07:53:46] <jeffsmykil> but you don't want it on the screen?
[07:54:31] <jeffsmykil> didn't know that was an accessibility problem
[07:55:00] <purefusion2> BarelyFitz: thanks :)
[07:55:31] <purefusion2> I've also heard that hiding content with CSS also hides it from the search engines
[07:55:52] <purefusion2> whether that part is true is probably debatable, but better not take such a risky chance
[07:56:10] <black_warlock> guys how can i get the previous span next the button  ?
[07:56:10] <jeffsmykil> guess it depends on what you are hiding
[07:56:40] <jeffsmykil> still trying to create an artificial active state for a button
[07:56:42] <jeffsmykil> any ideas?
[07:56:48] <Tobbi> Is there a good way to do stuff when a designated element gets added to the DOM?
[07:56:50] <jeffsmykil> getting it to change isnt the problem
[07:56:52] <jeffsmykil> its to change back
[07:56:54] <pkiller> so noone has an idea how should i start making my project a reality? :)
[07:57:07] <Tobbi> (Like, I want $("#myid").added(handler);
[07:57:13] <kenthree> scripts in body block rendering, scripts in head do too because they need to be done downloading first right?
[08:02:04] <c00kiemon5ter> hi all, I want to select all h2.myclass elements and onclick toggle the ul that comes right after. However I don't know how to select only the clicked one's ul element.
[08:02:07] <c00kiemon5ter> here is what I have
[08:02:08] <c00kiemon5ter>  http://sprunge.us/aNNE
[08:02:48] <andrew9183> hey guys, i have a slight bug - when i do a:hover it applies a red border, and when i click the <a> it brings up a dialog.  when i close that dialog and the mouse is not over the <a> the section is still bordered.  how would i remove this ?
[08:02:52] <jeffsmykil> c00kiemon5ter: if you create a jsfiddle you will get more help
[08:02:54] <c00kiemon5ter> The dom is like this <h3>..</h3><ul><li../li></ul> (repeated)
[08:03:02] <c00kiemon5ter> jeffsmykil: hmm alright
[08:03:58] <y3di> can you use inArray for an array of arbitrary objects?
[08:09:13] <c00kiemon5ter> http://jsfiddle.net/LdK8y/
[08:09:53] <c00kiemon5ter> here: I want to click each 'head x' and have the ul hide,
[08:10:07] <c00kiemon5ter> but not all ul's just the one under the h2 clicked
[08:10:11] <Eviltwin> y3di: Yeah
[08:10:30] <jeffsmykil> c00kiemon5ter: I can show you hold on
[08:10:37] <c00kiemon5ter> great :)
[08:11:00] <Eviltwin> c00kiemon5ter: http://jsfiddle.net/LdK8y/1/
[08:11:35] <c00kiemon5ter> oh, nice. next did the job
[08:11:39] <jcrawford> hey guys I have an input which is using the masked input plugin.  I would also like to change the text case to uppercase, is there an easy way to do this for an input?  I can use .change() just not sure how to force the text to uppercase :D
[08:11:49] <jeffsmykil> or Eviltwin can show you FASTER
[08:11:52] * jeffsmykil shakes his fist
[08:12:02] <c00kiemon5ter> haha, thanks jeffsmykil and Eviltwin
[08:12:21] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: I'm looking to toggle class and then toggle back say 50 ms later
[08:12:29] <necromancer> is there a plugin kinda like jquery.datepicker that works for time as well
[08:13:08] <jeffsmykil> first toggle on click
[08:13:18] <Iszak> ?g jquery timepickr @ necromancer
[08:13:19] <bot-t> necromancer, jQuery.timepickr.js - http://haineault.com/media/jquery/ui-timepickr/page/
[08:14:43] <jeffsmykil> necromancer: you know of a way to toggle a class and then go back to the original in a timed manner?
[08:14:45] <necromancer> Iszak: looks good...but is there anything that just adds on to datepicker?
[08:15:02] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: uhh...removeClass() then addClass()?
[08:15:07] <Iszak> ?g jquery ui time picker @ necromancer
[08:15:08] <necromancer> what do you mean by "timed manner"?
[08:15:08] <bot-t> necromancer, Adding a Timepicker to jQuery UI Datepicker - http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[08:15:12] <jeffsmykil> yeah necro	but how to time it
[08:15:23] <jeffsmykil> so the add happens 50ms later
[08:15:43] <Iszak> ?mdc setTimeout @ jeffsmykil
[08:15:44] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, window.setTimeout - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[08:15:46] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: look up setTimeout
[08:15:47] <necromancer> there ya go
[08:15:57] <jeffsmykil> yeah rather not use settimeout
[08:16:02] <jeffsmykil> im emulating a button click
[08:16:06] <jeffsmykil> the a:action state
[08:16:27] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: too bad
[08:16:30] <necromancer> that's what you got
[08:16:31] <Iszak> ?delay @ jeffsmykil
[08:16:32] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[08:16:34] <necromancer> lol
[08:16:35] <Iszak> not sure if that'll work, but tias.
[08:16:41] <necromancer> delay = setTimeout...
[08:17:19] <jeffsmykil> ill try delay first
[08:17:20] <jeffsmykil> lol
[08:17:37] <necromancer> ...why?
[08:17:51] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: one day, you'll have to learn pure JS...
[08:17:52] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: What's your goal exactly?
[08:17:54] <necromancer> might as well be today
[08:18:05] <y3di> Eviltwin: thanks
[08:18:24] <Eviltwin> y3di: You're welcome
[08:19:17] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: essentially this
[08:19:18] <jeffsmykil> $("#" + clickedID).removeClass("orange").addClass("orangeActive").delay(500).addClass("orange").removeClass("orangeActive");
[08:19:53] <Eviltwin> Well that's not going to work
[08:19:58] <jeffsmykil> nope
[08:20:07] <Eviltwin> This is where you need to use setTimeout
[08:20:08] <jeffsmykil> but it told you what i wanted to do :)
[08:20:08] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[08:20:11] <jeffsmykil> ok
[08:20:17] <jeffsmykil> im emulating a button click
[08:20:21] <jeffsmykil> the active state
[08:20:32] <ch3mical> .delay only works with animations I believe
[08:20:37] <jeffsmykil> yeah it does
[08:21:56] <Eviltwin> Still not sure why you're trying not to use setTimeout
[08:22:02] <jeffsmykil> me either
[08:22:06] <jeffsmykil> doing it now
[08:22:07] <dw> does jquery have an inverse of $.param()?
[08:22:23] <NoiseEee> is there a #jquery recommended tooltip plugin?
[08:22:42] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/3cs48/
[08:23:03] <Iszak> dw: regular expressions :D
[08:23:15] <dw> :)
[08:23:48] <Eviltwin> Pretty much, at least the single-level parsing isn't hard
[08:24:00] <jeffsmykil> thanks Eviltwin thats simpler than what i was writting
[08:26:53] <black_warlock> need help here
[08:26:56] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/sEGxB/1/
[08:26:58] <black_warlock> plox
[08:27:34] <quicksilver> black_warlock: you can't have two things with the same id.
[08:27:37] <black_warlock> i have to get the id .click with attr name = xpand
[08:28:02] <black_warlock> hell that sux
[08:28:07] <AdvoWork> whats the best way to store a currency symbol? say if im pulling GBP, USD etc, and i know my record needs USD, i want to add $ as the first character in an input field, would i store it in a hidden input field and then pull it when needed or?
[08:28:09] <black_warlock> i must change the css
[08:29:08] <black_warlock> okey im changing it
[08:29:13] <black_warlock> i made 2 diff ids
[08:30:56] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/sEGxB/7/
[08:32:15] <black_warlock> i have to toggle down the previous span post with id = fullpost
[08:33:01] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: For the *ENTIRE* document, there can only be one element with a given ID
[08:33:04] <Eviltwin> That's what makes it an ID
[08:34:15] <black_warlock> but i have many
[08:34:26] <Eviltwin> Okay, let me explain again
[08:34:30] <Eviltwin> You're doing it wrong
[08:34:31] <black_warlock> buttons and spans
[08:34:32] <Eviltwin> You can't do that
[08:34:37] <Eviltwin> You're not allowed to
[08:34:47] <black_warlock> wut balls
[08:34:55] <Eviltwin> $("#idhere") always returns 0 or 1 elements
[08:34:56] <black_warlock> it means who wrote the article its a niub
[08:35:12] <black_warlock> i had to use class dam
[08:35:26] <black_warlock> the blog its fooked up
[08:35:56] <black_warlock> i know the id must be unique but its done
[08:36:39] <Eviltwin> What?
[08:36:51] <Eviltwin> That sentence should end at "unique"
[08:36:54] <Eviltwin> There's no "but"
[08:36:57] <black_warlock> i have list of all articles in which there are always span id=fullpost and the 2 buttons
[08:37:11] <Eviltwin> And I'm telling you that you're fucked if you do that, sorry
[08:37:29] <black_warlock> but it worked for some time till i changed the theme
[08:37:43] <y3di> if an api doesn't support jsonp, does that mean you can't do ajax requests to the api client side?
[08:38:39] <black_warlock> in each article there is infact the span id = fullpost but i have more than thausand articles
[08:38:48] <thefalling> I have html in the structure <tbody><tr><td><button> and to access the tbody when button is pushed i can just do $(this).parent().parent().parent(), but $(this).parentsUntil('tbody') doesnt work
[08:39:13] <thefalling> why doesnt the parentsUntil work in that instance?
[08:46:47] <black_warlock> ok i have changed the id into class
[08:47:32] <mikunos> hi guys I am trying to solve a common problem for many web designers. Joining the Fancybox and the Flowplayer without frame.

[08:54:40] <durre> hi! I have a json response like this: http://pastebin.com/mGe3AN7K .. can I poulate a form easily based on this? like set input name to "Biano footwear" and storeUrl input to bianco.se ... without a bunch of if else
[08:55:17] <thefalling> I have html in the structure <tbody><tr><td><button> and to access the tbody when button is pushed i can just do $(this).parent().parent().parent(), but $(this).parentsUntil('tbody') doesnt work
[08:55:19] <thefalling> why doesnt the parentsUntil work in that instance?
[08:55:43] <Eviltwin> Because that's not what parentsUntil does
[08:55:47] <Eviltwin> ?.parentsUntil
[08:55:47] <bot-t> .parentsUntil([selector], [filter]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/parentsUntil/
[08:55:52] <Eviltwin> You should see ?.closest
[08:55:53] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[08:58:30] <theallan2> Hello all, I have a selector / traveral query - if I have an array of elements, how can I perform a standard selector on that array that includes not only the elements in the array, but also their decendents?
[08:59:04] <theallan2> $().filter() will filter just my array, while $().find() works on the decendents - I'm looking for a combination of the two - is that possible?
[09:00:10] <theallan2> I thought $(array).andSelf().find(selector) might do the trick, but apparently not
[09:00:11] <mightym> maybe a stupid question, but I'm new to js/dom manipulation: ive several textareas which contain initial text, is it possible to use sth. like linkify to convert links inside of the text area to a link … or is this not possible and i first have to change the text area to f.e. a span … and on focus back to a text area?
[09:00:52] <Eviltwin> theallan2: var x=$("original selector");var y=x.filter("second selector");y.add(x.find("second selector")); ?
[09:01:56] <Sugitime> Why would my jquery work on my local dev env (windows) and not work when I uploaded to my server (linux)? Same browser, same computer
[09:02:52] <necromancer> Sugitime: what do you mean by "not work"?
[09:03:32] <Sugitime> When I change a drop down, its supposed to show/hide a field. Its working locally but not on the production server. But I think I found the issue. It relies upon an ajax call, and the URI is messed up.
[09:03:39] <Sugitime> Atleast thats something that makes sense lol
[09:03:44] <theallan2> Eviltwin: Just trying it out just now - thanks for the suggestion
[09:04:06] <necromancer> Sugitime: i was gonna say that's probably the reason. windows filesystem uses \, whereas linux filesystem uses /.
[09:04:39] <necromancer> ?attr durre

[09:04:45] <necromancer> ahaha what
[09:04:47] <necromancer> ?attr
[09:04:47] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[09:04:50] <necromancer> there we go
[09:04:54] <necromancer> durre: ^^^
[09:05:12] <necromancer> json responses get turned into JS objects so just use .attr() on the <input> you wish to change
[09:05:21] <necromancer> you CAN NOT change <input type>s on the fly using jQuery
[09:05:24] <necromancer> just so you know
[09:05:30] <necromancer> but i think names & values are ok
[09:05:42] <jeffsmykil> having a brain fart what is the highlighted box around an input called again?
[09:05:54] <necromancer> border
[09:05:57] <necromancer> lol
[09:06:03] <jeffsmykil> yeah but there's something special in css
[09:06:14] <necromancer> nope, it's border
[09:06:30] <Eviltwin> necromancer: jQuery doesn't let you change the type of an input or button because you can't do it in IE
[09:06:48] <necromancer> right, IE 5.5-7 fucks up
[09:09:10] <jeffsmykil> outline: none necromancer
[09:09:12] <jeffsmykil> not border
[09:10:58] <mightym> or maybe someone can tell me if its possible to just change a element in the dom and keep its content?
[09:11:35] <Eviltwin> mightym: Can you make a pastebin showing what the DOM looks like before and after this "change"?
[09:11:51] <aglemann> ok, question for a js ninja pls.. i'd like to have an object with key/value where the key is a node... the problem is two different nodes of the same kind (nodename) will appear to be the same.. for example
[09:12:33] <black_warlock> i have a class with double properties
[09:12:34] <aglemann> div1 = <div />, div2 = <div/>, x = {}, x[div1] = true, x[div2] // returns true
[09:13:01] <black_warlock> how to set it in jquery : exmple div class="pip pop"
[09:13:25] <black_warlock> if i write ('.pip pop') doesnt work
[09:13:30] <aglemann> ahh, nevermind, i see it gets converted to a string
[09:13:42] <mute> .pip .pop
[09:13:43] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: $(".pip.pop")
[09:13:51] <Eviltwin> mute: Incorrect
[09:14:00] <snover> aglemann: you cannot use objects as keys
[09:14:01] <snover> yes
[09:14:05] <Eviltwin> That's an element with class "pop" contained within an element with class "pip"
[09:14:07] <webPragmatist> how can i get the count of objects selected by a selector?
[09:14:09] <black_warlock> Evil its rrihgt
[09:14:14] <black_warlock> but why that ?
[09:14:15] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: .length on the end
[09:14:28] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: Why is...what?
[09:14:44] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: $("a").length === number of A tags in the DOM
[09:15:42] <mightym> Eviltwin: http://www.pastie.org/3016594
[09:16:46] <aidan> how can I select all <select> elements except those with a particular parent id?
[09:16:55] <Eviltwin> mightym: I asked for before and after HTML
[09:17:06] <Eviltwin> mightym: Because I didn't understand what you wanted to be changed to what
[09:17:26] <Chopps> hey guys, can someone tell me why this doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/crgEH/ but this http://jsfiddle.net/crgEH/1/ does? i want to append more html markup besides the clone, hope u guys can help me out
[09:18:07] <Eviltwin> aidan: I'd have to think about the efficiency but something like $(":not(#parent) select") should work
[09:19:08] <mightym> Eviltwin: http://www.pastie.org/3016614
[09:19:12] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Because clone is not a string
[09:19:31] <Eviltwin> mightym: See ?.replaceWith
[09:19:32] <bot-t> mightym, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[09:19:39] <aidan> Eviltwin: nice thanks
[09:20:09] <Eviltwin> mightym: Or perhaps .wrap and .unwrap
[09:20:54] <mkv25> hey: how do I prevent an ajax request (.get()) converting quotes "s to %22's when it makes the reqest?
[09:20:57] <Chopps> Eviltwin, any idea how can i append more html markup besides the clone?
[09:21:52] <mkv25> chops, what are you using to append at the moment?
[09:21:58] <aidan> Eviltwin: does not seem to work :/
[09:22:07] <jef_> how do I amend my ccs with new css in jquery?... whar abt my divs?
[09:22:12] <Eviltwin> aidan: Is it just text or is it HTML?
[09:22:18] <mightym> Eviltwin: ill check, thx a lot
[09:22:49] <aidan> Eviltwin: huh?
[09:22:53] <Eviltwin> Chopps: parent.append('<br /><b>Clone</b> ').append(clone).append('<br/>');
[09:23:00] <theallan2> Eviltwin: Sorry for the delay in confirming that works - I got a little confused as to what it didn't appear to be working for me. I was trying to work on DOM elements which have been removed from the document tree, and add() will only work with elements which are sitll in the tree
[09:23:30] <Chopps> mkv25, $('<br /><b>Clone</b> 'clone).appendTo(parent);
[09:24:56] <mkv25> $('#container').append('<p>new html</p>'); // adds HTML as a child to a container
[09:25:51] <Eviltwin> I know it's a free service but it pisses me off when jsFiddle doesn't work

[09:26:31] <diverdude> Did anybody try this jquery richtext editor: https://github.com/akzhan/jwysiwyg ?
[09:26:45] <Chopps> yes Eviltwin giving me issues atm lots of gateway errors, btw thank you, it works :D
[09:27:26] <Chopps> mkv25, this parent.append('<br /><b>Clone</b> ').append(clone).append('<br/>'); worked like a charm, thanks anyway
[09:27:39] <mkv25> cool
[09:30:32] <aidan> Eviltwin: what is that?
[09:32:03] <Eviltwin> aidan: Open it and see
[09:33:48] <aidan> Eviltwin: think you linked me to the wrong thing

[09:34:36] <aidan> http://jsfiddle.net/eegd5/1/
[09:34:40] <mkv25> to answer my own question: (how do I prevent an ajax request (.get()) converting quotes "s to %22's when it makes the reqest?) --- answer: you can't, its the default action of the XHR object to add those
[09:35:13] <Eviltwin> aidan: Oh, sorry
[09:35:17] <Eviltwin> mightym: http://jsfiddle.net/f6QbU/

[09:36:40] <aidan> select:not(:parent(#foo)) :/
[09:37:16] <guy> I want to pass a variable to $.ajax(); that I could use later in success callback. The problem is that if another request is made in the mean before success callback, that variable (if read from global scope) might have already been changed.
[09:37:29] <Eviltwin> aidan: That's not what the parent selector does
[09:37:43] <webPragmatist> this might be off topic but is console.log("foo"); … not how you get chrome console to log?
[09:37:45] <Eviltwin> guy: So use non-global scope
[09:37:56] <guy> so.. how do I pass it to $.ajax() ?
[09:37:59] <guy> the variable.
[09:38:57] <guy> https://gist.github.com/7ab1d691d0956550cb41
[09:38:58] <guy> e.g.
[09:39:22] <guy> the `tag` variable might have been changed by the time the success callback is received.
[09:39:44] <guy> I therefore need to get a copy somehow.
[09:39:48] <diverdude> Did anybody try this jquery richtext editor: https://github.com/akzhan/jwysiwyg ?
[09:40:05] <aidan> Eviltwin: yeah, I see
[09:40:14] <aidan> Eviltwin: I'll go with htis: select:not([name*=day]):not([name*=year])
[09:40:20] <guy> diverdude:  you do realize there is a demo, right? http://akzhan.github.com/jwysiwyg/help/examples/01-basic.html
[09:40:23] <aidan> it's not ideal but does the same thing
[09:40:24] <EverettZ> I've been doing some research, is there any way to get x-domain xml w/o a proxy or wrapping in JSONP?
[09:40:29] <aidan> (in my markup)
[09:40:57] <mightym> Eviltwin: oh :) thx a lot mate! very kind from you
[09:41:08] <diverdude> guy, yes...but i am interested in its cross browser compatibility

[09:41:46] <guy> Eviltwin: thanks.
[09:43:04] <smallcapsdude> hello
[09:44:13] <Websteria> Question: Why is it that deferred loads slow EVERYTHING down in terms of rendering on the browser?
[09:44:36] <Websteria> I can do the same thing and not use deferred and just an .ajax call and it's fine, but the second I use deferred it slows to a crawl.
[09:45:01] <Eviltwin> Websteria: You mean a script tag with a deferred attribute?
[09:45:15] <Websteria> No, I mean $.deferred() or $.when().Then()
[09:45:37] <Eviltwin> There's nothing slow about Deferreds when they're used right
[09:45:52] <Websteria> So what would cause them to slow down when they are used wrong?
[09:45:57] <diverdude> guy, you see
[09:45:57] <Websteria> I'm just trying to understand....
[09:46:06] <guy> diverdude: ?
[09:46:13] <guy> Just google.
[09:47:21] <diverdude> guy, i did that
[09:47:22] <Chopps> Eviltwin, another question, why cant i open a tag in the first html markup append, then append the clone, then append more html markup and close the tag here? like in this example http://jsfiddle.net/crgEH/2/
[09:47:37] <Eviltwin> Chopps: 'Cause JavaScript doesn't work in HTML
[09:47:43] <Eviltwin> It works in elements
[09:47:47] <Eviltwin> In the DOM
[09:47:56] <Eviltwin> Elements have a parent and can have children
[09:48:06] <Eviltwin> There's no notion of opening and closing tags
[09:48:45] <takahiro> how do i reference the original element from a jquery ui dialog button function? i just want the form to be submitted when the user clicks "confirm" on the dialog box
[09:48:55] <groovetrain> Chopps: you have to build it all at once
[09:50:11] <Chopps> i see, thanks for the explanation Eviltwin, groovetrain can i build it all before appending it to the parent?
[09:50:31] <groovetrain> Chopps, yes, that's the cleanest way to do it
[09:50:50] <groovetrain> like build your div, then append the clone to it, then append it all
[09:51:24] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Just waiting for the jsFiddle to update
[09:51:35] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/crgEH/4/
[09:52:19] <groovetrain> anyone know how to get a return value from a _trigger-ed event in the Widget builder?
[09:52:47] <smallcapsdude> Million dollar question: I have an external script that modifies the dom and my jquery code can be placed at the end of <body>, how do I add event handlers to DOM elements added by that immutable external javascript?
[09:53:12] <Chopps> ty Eviltwin, lets see if i can make that happen on my real code :S
[09:53:38] <Eviltwin> smallcapsdude: Does that mean you'll pay me a million dollars if I answer it?
[09:53:41] <groovetrain> smallcapsdude: do you own the external script?
[09:54:11] <Eviltwin> groovetrain: I think by immutable he meant that external script cannot be changed
[09:55:14] <kflorence> does $.getScript use XHR or not?
[09:55:15] <smallcapsdude> groovetrain: i dont own the minified external script
[09:55:43] <Eviltwin> kflorence: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[09:56:08] <kflorence> Eviltwin: yes, that page doesn't say explicitly. I know that it uses $.ajax internally, but some of my coworkers believe it doesn't use XHR
[09:56:10] <groovetrain> smallcapsdude: maybe setInterval to poll for something the external script loads, then execute your code when it finds
[09:56:12] <BarelyFitz> kflorence: I think it does if possible (same domain)
[09:56:23] <kflorence> BarelyFitz: ok, that would make sense
[09:56:25] <denom> Is there a way to block the thread on a deferred until it fires the `done` callbacks?
[09:56:35] <smallcapsdude> groovetrain: considered that, but it's hacky
[09:56:43] <Eviltwin> kflorence: Pretty sure it doesn't use XHR
[09:56:55] <Eviltwin> denom: There's only one thread in JavaScript so you don't want to block it
[09:56:57] <groovetrain> smallcapsdude: I mean if there were a load event fired on <script> tags, it'd be easy, right?
[09:57:29] <denom> Let's see, can I async block?
[09:57:55] <smallcapsdude> smallcapsdude: not easy. the evil external script is doing addEventHandlers within $.ready
[09:58:17] <denom> What I want is to fire an ajax request, get a deferred back and then sit on that deferred until the request returns
[09:58:26] <Eviltwin> smallcapsdude: Before we go too far, you know about event bubbling, right?
[09:58:35] <smallcapsdude> Eviltwin: yessir
[09:58:49] <Eviltwin> Okay, good
[09:58:54] <groovetrain> ah yes, stopPropogation?
[09:59:01] <groovetrain> err sp.
[09:59:16] <Eviltwin> So you need to attach event listeners to elements created and added by this script
[09:59:27] <Eviltwin> Can you craft a selector that's unique to them?
[09:59:58] <takahiro> how can i get the context of the button that triggered a dialog appearing in the function bound to the dialog's button?
[10:01:07] <Eviltwin> denom: There are very few ways to block in JavaScript and you shouldn't use any of them
[10:01:15] <smallcapsdude> Eviltwin: yes, they have id attribute
[10:01:27] <Eviltwin> smallcapsdude: What kind of events are you trying to listen for?
[10:01:36] <denom> Thanks Eviltwin
[10:01:41] <smallcapsdude> Eviltwin: <form>.onsubmit
[10:01:47] <Eviltwin> denom: You should use callbacks
[10:02:10] <smallcapsdude> Eviltwin: extrnal script does not support callbacks
[10:02:15] <kflorence> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/script.js#L31 - it seems it does use XHR for same domain requests and script injection otherwise
[10:02:19] <Eviltwin> smallcapsdude: Okay, is there an existing element in the document they are being added to?
[10:02:58] <Eviltwin> smallcapsdude: Notice that I was addressing denom, not you
[10:03:04] <smallcapsdude> Eviltwin: yes
[10:03:30] <Eviltwin> For his issue, there are callbacks and he should use them
[10:04:53] <Eviltwin> smallcapsdude: So lets say that this adds an element with id #dynamic
[10:05:01] <Eviltwin> And you know its inside an element with id #static
[10:06:28] <Eviltwin> You can bind to capture say click events from #dynamic (even if it's not in the DOM yet) by doing $("#static").on("click","#dynamic",function(){...})
[10:06:36] <Eviltwin> Because they'll bubble up to #static
[10:06:48] <Eviltwin> And static can check the event target to see if it matches the #dynamic selector
[10:06:55] <smallcapsdude> Eviltwin: but not form.onsubmit, correct?
[10:07:11] <Eviltwin> I need to double check on that one
[10:07:27] <Eviltwin> However you could bind to the click on the submit button
[10:07:39] <smallcapsdude> Eviltwin: especially if their event handler takes precedence and calls stopPropagation() or returns false
[10:07:46] <smallcapsdude> Eviltwin: correct?
[10:08:03] <Eviltwin> Well it's bad form to unnecessarily stopPropagation
[10:08:12] <diverdude> What rich textbox module for writing letters with smileys etc. do you guys recommend?
[10:10:35] <Eviltwin> smallcapsdude: Actually here the submit event is bubbling just fine
[10:10:38] <smallcapsdude> Eviltwin: so essentially my event handlers are unreachable, no?
[10:11:08] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/gYsqn/
[10:15:25] <takahiro> here is the dialog code im having problems with http://jsfiddle.net/6Zhh2/

[10:23:04] <lilmikey> hi. how do I find a next element of a type in the document tree?
[10:23:05] <dmsuperman> How do I pop an element out of a selector object?
[10:23:11] <lilmikey> after $(this)
[10:23:27] <dmsuperman> Like .eq(x) but the element is removed from the selector.
[10:24:13] <lilmikey> use .remove()
[10:24:44] <lilmikey> how do I find a next element of a type after $(this)?
[10:25:06] <danzik171> dmsuperman: see ?not - pass it the element
[10:25:06] <bot-t> dmsuperman, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[10:25:09] <BarelyFitz> lilmikey: .nextAll() if you are looking for siblings
[10:25:10] <black_warlock> .closest()
[10:25:18] <lilmikey> not siblings
[10:25:36] <lilmikey> all elements in document tree
[10:26:17] <black_warlock> hem
[10:26:30] <black_warlock> you have to encapsulate them inside some element
[10:27:20] <black_warlock> $(this).parent('.post').find('#fullpost').toggle('slow');
[10:27:27] <danzik171> lilmikey: var foo = $( 'selector' );  foo.eq( foo.index( element ) + 1 );
[10:27:56] <black_warlock> boh

[10:28:42] <black_warlock> danzik how can i check the state of a toggle ?
[10:28:50] <black_warlock> if its open or its closed
[10:29:29] <danzik171> black_warlock: that's just visiblity right?  see ?visible
[10:29:29] <bot-t> black_warlock, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/

[10:34:40] <black_warlock> is(':hide')
[10:35:46] <danzik171> black_warlock: either is(':hidden') or is(':visible') depending on what state you want to check

[10:39:26] <IvanKuzev> black_warlock you have to animate the scrooltop of the container.....like document or parent div
[10:40:11] <black_warlock> parent div
[10:40:47] <black_warlock> each post has a box <div class='post-body entry-content'>
[10:41:03] <black_warlock> in each box there is an anchor
[10:41:20] <black_warlock> <a name="titlexp"></a>

[10:45:37] <solidus-river> groovetrain: i know i can use zindex and absolute, but i was pretty sure absolute wont stick to bottom
[10:45:45] <groovetrain> solidus-river: can't you just use position:static?
[10:45:49] <groovetrain> err
[10:45:52] <groovetrain> fixed?

[11:06:14] <black_warlock> your*
[11:06:38] <black_warlock> it finds fullpost is open

[11:09:02] <denom> In an ajax request, is a deferred's state changed after the success callbacks are fired or after the request returns?
[11:10:49] <Eviltwin> Not sure
[11:10:50] <Eviltwin> ?tias
[11:10:50] <bot-t> Try It And See
[11:12:03] <kborchers> Chopps: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/t89zj/
[11:12:34] <denom> It looks like the deferred state is changing after the request returns. This is counter intuitive, if there are callbacks pending the deferred should wait...
[11:13:18] <denom> guess I have to use the success: option in the call to $.ajax
[11:13:43] <Chopps> yes kborchers, exactly like that :D
[11:13:47] <Chopps> thank you man
[11:13:51] <kborchers> np

[11:20:51] <craigwhite> try again... Using RoR - have JS code <http://jsfiddle.net/white_n_az/8Ft5v/> that runs but when the partial refreshes, the js code needs to execute again - how do I accomplish that?
[11:21:09] <black_warlock> looking
[11:23:23] <sterlo> Question: I have a jQuery plugin. The plugin currently loads a carousel. This carousel has autoSlide set to true. Because of the environment I am working in, I cannot change the actual code to have autoSlide = false. I have to do it AFTER the page loads. Is there a way I can go about accomplishing this goal? The goal being to not have it autoslide anymore. Context:  https://gist.github.com/1477981
[11:23:47] <Guest39437> Hello everybody! Super bonus points for any help (100 extra bonus points). I'm having this terrible thing in IE7. I have built a gallery "thing" with jQuery, and it works great everywhere, but for some reason in IE7 EVEN THOUGH IT WORKS great, it does not actually "display" when I load the page. The gallery doesn't actually display until you do some "fiddling" around, for instance starting the develoepr toolbar in IE7 and then closing it again
[11:23:47] <Guest39437>  somehow triggers everything to work perfectly.
[11:29:31] <TheEmpath> hail jquerians
[11:29:50] <TheEmpath> i look for a place where your most talented go to show off their skill sets so that I may allure them with money to do my bidding
[11:30:07] <TheEmpath> what say you!?
[11:30:16] <Chopps> hey kborchers, need ur help again, i did a little moddification to the code u gave me, http://jsfiddle.net/t89zj/1/ but im having an issue, how can i make it start on 1 if i erase all the content of the textarea?
[11:34:48] <kborchers> Chopps: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/t89zj/4/
[11:37:35] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/t89zj/5/
[11:39:05] <Chopps> thank you both :D
[11:39:23] <Eviltwin> Mine's better
[11:40:18] <Chopps> less code, im still trying to understand what u did hehe
[11:40:32] <Eviltwin> Well go to his
[11:40:35] <Eviltwin> Press enter a few times
[11:40:42] <Eviltwin> Then delete a few of those lines (but not all)
[11:40:44] <Eviltwin> And press enter again
[11:40:49] <Eviltwin> Then do it in mine
[11:43:06] <Chopps> oh your numeration is based on the num of lines, not in the variable, nice :D
[11:43:12] <Eviltwin> Yup'
[11:44:22] <kollapse> Which one of you is the bot ?
[11:44:42] <Eviltwin> I is the bot
[11:45:29] <Chopps> also one thing i noticed, if u write something and reach the end of the line, the data does not continue in the next line, but instead the whole line moves to the next line, dont know if i explained myself, but just go to the fiddle and input data till u reach the end of the limit of the text area, u will notice what i wanted to explain
[11:46:00] <Engin> best way to handle money input ? (i.e. adding commans as user types etc)... anything off the shelf you can think of ?
[11:46:08] <Eviltwin> Chopps: It's called line-breaking
[11:46:13] <Eviltwin> I think it can be fixed with the right CSS
[11:46:20] <Eviltwin> Might want to ask in #css
[11:49:52] <craigwhite> try again... how do I change http://jsfiddle.net/white_n_az/8Ft5v/ so that it is called each time #member_management div is changed?
[11:49:55] <Chopps> oh thanks Eviltwin will do it
[11:52:03] <Engin> don't make me write this boring thing!
[11:58:09] <black_warlock> how can i get back the text to "Espandi"
[11:58:14] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/sEGxB/88/
[11:58:31] <black_warlock> $(this).html("Reducto");
[11:59:16] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: Also see ?.text
[11:59:17] <bot-t> black_warlock, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[11:59:42] <black_warlock> have tried else{ $(this).html("Espandi");
[12:01:07] <black_warlock> hum
[12:01:08] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/sEGxB/93/
[12:01:14] <black_warlock> it works when i open it
[12:01:21] <Chopps> so i was putting this code on my project, and i got this error Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on' any idea why?
[12:01:30] <black_warlock> the text change but doesnt go back to "Espandi"
[12:01:37] <Chopps> this code: http://jsfiddle.net/t89zj/5/
[12:02:06] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Probably because what you're calling .on on isn't a jQuery object
[12:02:09] <Eviltwin> But rather a DOM element
[12:02:11] <Eviltwin> Or something else entirely
[12:03:02] <Eviltwin> Chopps: You realize that if you show us code without the error, that really doesn't help us find the error in the slightest, right?
[12:03:47] <Chopps> well the text are is same as i used on the jsfiddle, the code in the jsfiddle is the same im using
[12:03:54] <Chopps> textarea*
[12:04:15] <Chopps> let me rephrase
[12:04:56] <Chopps> the textarea is the same im using on my project, the js code in the jsfiddle is the same code im using
[12:05:12] <nail_> Chopps: $ is probably not jQuery in your project
[12:05:19] <Chopps> maybe jquery version? im using 1.6.4, jsfiddle is using 1.7.1
[12:05:19] <nail_> hence no 'on'
[12:05:28] <Eviltwin> Correct
[12:05:33] <Eviltwin> 1.6.4 does not have .on
[12:05:53] <Eviltwin> Either change it to $(".resizeta").keyup(function(event){...})
[12:06:01] <Eviltwin> Or to $(".resizeta").bind("keyup",function(event){...})
[12:06:22] <Eviltwin> Instead of $(".resizeta").on("keyup",function(event){...})
[12:06:50] <Chopps> bind it is :D
[12:07:10] <Chopps> and it works :D thank you Eviltwin
[12:07:20] <Chopps> Eviltwin++
[12:07:28] <Chopps> hee no beer bot here XD
[12:07:49] <Eviltwin> I am accepting small cash donations instead: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[12:09:05] <Chopps> if that thing accepts pp i will donate
[12:09:23] <Eviltwin> I think it only accepts PayPal
[12:11:12] <sphinxxx> anyone here used soundmanager2 ?
[12:14:22] <Chopps> done Eviltwin ;) thanks again
[12:14:33] <alexfreewalker_> hello
[12:14:51] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Thank you
[12:15:48] <fission6> whats wrong with this, propagation still occurs http://dpaste.org/uVWyO/
[12:17:15] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by "propagation still occurs"?
[12:17:18] <Eviltwin> What's happening?
[12:17:33] <alexfreewalker_> I have a list with ids dynamically generated from the server, when I click on them, some action on the server side are performed and I use $('span[id^="f"]').load('/ span[id^="f"]'); but the problem is, all the fields with id f(something) gets filled with all the values with the same id, can anyone help??
[12:18:06] <fission6> Eviltwin: okay i think i got it
[12:18:27] <fission6> hey out of curiousity if you make an ajax call and your not concerned about the response is their an idea callback function pattern?
[12:18:41] <Eviltwin> alexfreewalker_: Can we see a little more code?
[12:18:58] <Eviltwin> fission6: So you're just trying to send data, not receive anything
[12:19:05] <Eviltwin> And don't care if there's an error
[12:19:23] <fission6> just basically making ajax url request to fire a background job
[12:19:40] <jaequery> cmon guys some more upvotes
[12:19:53] <Eviltwin> fission6: Just don't specify a callback at all?
[12:19:55] <jaequery> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3353308
[12:19:56] <fission6> ok
[12:20:00] <fission6> makes sense
[12:20:11] <fission6> i mean ideally you should always get a respoinse and check it but for now...
[12:20:12] <jaequery> help me out here, only 4 votes so far :/
[12:20:27] <Eviltwin> Can I give downvotes?
[12:20:44] <jaequery> :/
[12:20:54] <craigwhite> solve my problem - I'll give you an upvote  ;-)
[12:21:01] <fission6> i wont a beer
[12:21:03] <fission6> want
[12:21:08] <Eviltwin> fission6: Generally it's best to handle the error somehow
[12:21:14] <fission6> right
[12:21:50] <fission6> anyone working with linkedin api, its crapping out today
[12:22:40] <alexfreewalker_> ok, I have a list of items that can be edited, and when editing is done the function $('span[id^="f"]').load('/ span[id^="f"]'); is triggered from my application which loads the item from the server using ajax, but the thing is when the code is exuted all fields with the the id that sarts with f $span[id^="f"]') gets loaded into the the fields from all other items due to load('/ span[id^="f"]');
[12:22:55] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ alexfreewalker_
[12:22:55] <bot-t> alexfreewalker_, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[12:23:28] <fission6> i just got javascript patterns in the mail today, hope its enlightening
[12:23:49] <alexfreewalker_> but the alpplication is a rails app;ication and the only jquery im using is $('span[id^="f"]').load('/ span[id^="f"]');
[12:24:18] <Eviltwin> If I understand you correctly span[id^="f"] matches more than one thing
[12:24:20] <Eviltwin> Right?
[12:24:24] <alexfreewalker_> yeah
[12:24:38] <Eviltwin> It does as well on the right hand side
[12:24:49] <Eviltwin> There's no cross-mapping between the two
[12:24:57] <alexfreewalker_> thats cuz i dont know how to get an id of the clicked item and save it into a variable
[12:26:36] <fission6> so you want to load ajax content into a clicked item's div or something
[12:26:39] <alexfreewalker_> like i click on item of id="f18" gets stored, data gets proceesed on the server side when i focus out that item with and id="f18" gets rendered with the new value
[12:27:27] <fission6> pass the item into your callback?
[12:27:44] <fission6> or give it proper scope?
[12:27:48] <alexfreewalker_> yeah but i cant load a specific item due to large list of server generated items with differen ids
[12:27:51] <Eviltwin> alexfreewalker_: Read this: http://jsfiddle.net/NXFyJ/
[12:27:52] <Eviltwin> Understand it
[12:28:29] <Eviltwin> The random number is included to see sequential loads
[12:28:40] <dmsuperman> Can I do something like this? input[name=test,value=tt]
[12:28:44] <alexfreewalker_> Eviltwin: thats fuckin awesome man!
[12:28:51] <Eviltwin> dmsuperman: You mean you want to match both?
[12:29:08] <Eviltwin> dmsuperman: That'd be input[name=test][value=tt]
[12:29:31] <Blaster> how would you go about telling which index of LI was clicked inside a UL?
[12:29:50] <alexfreewalker_> Eviltwin: thaks a lot :)
[12:29:56] <Eviltwin> alexfreewalker_: Notice how inside the click listener, I stop referring to the selector span[id^="f"] because that refers to all of them
[12:30:07] <Eviltwin> Instead I work with "this" because that refers to the one I clicked
[12:30:22] <alexfreewalker_> cool :)
[12:30:28] <Pilate> Blaster: this.parentNode.parentNode.indexOf(this), or something
[12:30:49] <Eviltwin> Blaster: So the thing that was clicked was an LI?
[12:31:51] <Eviltwin> Blaster: see ?.index
[12:31:51] <bot-t> Blaster, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[12:31:56] <Eviltwin> Or this example: http://jsfiddle.net/pd9zh/
[12:32:18] <timing_> hi guys
[12:32:22] <imsky> WHAT DO YOU WANT
[12:32:35] <timing> imsky: TALKING TO ME?!
[12:32:37] <Eviltwin> ?ask
[12:32:38] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:32:39] <imsky> I DONT KNOW
[12:32:42] <imsky> YES
[12:32:45] <timing> OK!
[12:33:10] <timing> well, I said, HI, which is not disallowed according to ?ask
[12:33:23] <timing> and who are you imsky?
[12:33:37] <Eviltwin> Not disallowed but 99% of people who come in here are looking for help
[12:33:38] <imsky> I AM YOUR HOST
[12:34:53] <alexfreewalker_> Eviltwin: how can i strip of the "f "from the id? cuz i have other items with a18, b18 for example and it would be really helpful if i can save the number only in the variable
[12:35:04] <timing> Eviltwin: I don't come here, I am here :-)
[12:35:14] <imsky> dammit
[12:35:17] <imsky> ASK YOUR QUESTION
[12:35:32] <Eviltwin> alexfreewalker_: Simplest is to strip the first character by doing var withoutf = this.id.substring(1);
[12:35:50] <timing> well anyway, sometimes I dont know if I can better return json and render some stuff with javascript, the other time I think it's better to create the html serverside. Where to draw the line? are there any guidelines to this?
[12:36:57] <Eviltwin> If you're going to have to do an excessive amount of wiring
[12:37:11] <Eviltwin> Like select/interact with the majority of the elements in the HTML
[12:37:28] <Eviltwin> There's probably going to be more overhead from doing the selection than just creating the elements in jQuery
[12:37:34] <Eviltwin> At which point you'd already have handles to them
[12:37:49] <Eviltwin> If you're pretty much just dumping it straight into the page
[12:38:04] <Eviltwin> And only touching a few elements at most, definitely go HTML
[12:38:09] <Eviltwin> Unless it really brings the size way up
[12:38:16] <Eviltwin> For whatever reason
[12:38:29] <imsky> what are you rambling about
[12:38:38] <Eviltwin> timing's question
[12:38:46] <imsky> it's pretty obvious
[12:38:58] <Eviltwin> "Always send JSON"?
[12:39:00] <imsky> yes
[12:39:26] <Eviltwin> imsky: This is why we have to PM people to disregard your advice
[12:39:40] <imsky> Eviltwin: have fun with <this></this> shit
[12:40:18] <alexfreewalker_>   $('span[id$="_url"]').show(); how can i insert the varaible here?    $('span[id$="HERE_url"]').show();
[12:40:29] <Eviltwin> String concatenation
[12:40:43] <Eviltwin> $('span[id$="'+thevar+'_url"]')
[12:41:09] <Eviltwin> BTW, $("#fullid") is like a billion times faster
[12:41:32] <Eviltwin> So if you can craft the full ID by putting strings together, do that
[12:41:33] <snover> like a billion
[12:41:46] <Eviltwin> snover: With an error bound of a billion
[12:41:48] <imsky> i wonder who's this "we" that keeps PMing people
[12:41:50] <alexfreewalker_> yeah but as i said, its variable dpending on database id
[12:42:27] <Eviltwin> alexfreewalker_: I'm saying if you're using $('span[id$="12_url"]') to match the element with id f12_url
[12:42:34] <Eviltwin> Use $("#f12_url") instead
[12:42:40] <craigwhite> Are my questions getting through?  Perhaps my question is simple but I've been stuck for 2 days now
[12:42:44] <Engin> meh buggy https://github.com/cwolves/jQuery-iMask
[12:42:55] <Engin> any alternative ?
[12:43:16] <Eviltwin> craigwhite: You asked your question an hour ago
[12:43:30] <Eviltwin> We don't have a magic queue of questions somewhere
[12:43:31] <craigwhite> ok - yes getting through
[12:43:54] <Eviltwin> If no one has responded for a while and people started talking about something else, politely ask your question again
[12:44:05] <craigwhite> I did
[12:44:11] <craigwhite> I can try again
[12:44:37] <alexfreewalker_> oh sometimes there is an id that is generated due to many to many relationship so is f12f18 with 2 variables
[12:44:45] <alexfreewalker_> but thanks for the tip
[12:45:12] <Eviltwin> craigwhite: If your question is more than 30-40 lines up, consider it likely missed
[12:45:33] <imsky> and if i'm involved, consider yourself PMed by Eviltwin
[12:45:33] <craigwhite> http://jsfiddle.net/white_n_az/8Ft5v/2/  - not sure that it's important but this code works 'once' but I need it to attach the js each time the <div> #member_management is updated
[12:45:36] <Eviltwin> In your case, it's 280 lines up
[12:46:28] <Eviltwin> craigwhite: Is there a reason you're replacing that entire block?
[12:47:28] <imsky> and with HTML, no doubt
[12:47:39] <craigwhite> the thing I am accomplishing (or intending to accomplish) is to make a drag & drop in two separate boxes, and items dragged into the other are posted to the server (works), then the div is refreshed
[12:47:42] <Eviltwin> If you can't do it another way (i.e. not completely replacing the #member_management) this is probably going to be your best option: http://jsfiddle.net/8Ft5v/3/
[12:47:57] <Eviltwin> craigwhite: Yeah, my question was about why you felt the need to refresh the div
[12:48:02] <Eviltwin> Or refresh it in that manner
[12:49:06] <imsky> loooool
[12:49:10] <Eviltwin> Anyway, I gotta run
[12:49:11] <Eviltwin> TTYL
[12:49:16] <imsky> GOODBYE
[12:49:24] <imsky> craigwhite: ignore that attach() business
[12:49:50] <craigwhite> preliminary indications is that it is working - thanks Eviltwin... now I have to figure out why that works and why I couldn't get there myself (though I do have to say that I never tried 'attach')
[12:50:01] <Eviltwin> It's cool, imsky's got you covered
[12:50:11] <imsky> defo, thx for teaching this guy the wrong way to do shit
[12:50:18] <craigwhite> why ignore the attach business?
[12:50:19] <imsky> OFF YOU GO TO XML LAND
[12:50:25] <imsky> OF PARSER ERRORS
[12:50:33] <imsky> craigwhite: do you understand why the code works?
[12:50:46] <Eviltwin> imsky'll be happy to explain it
[12:50:48] <craigwhite> I am totally unconcerned about errors because this is all prescribed
[12:50:57] <imsky> Eviltwin: leave already lol
[12:51:00] <craigwhite> No, I am starting to look at it now
[12:52:10] <craigwhite> seems to the be same as my code with the 2 'attach()' methods... that must somehow be attaching to any appropriate elements
[12:52:33] <Ahrengot> Hey guys. Any way to tell how many times a jQuery plugin has been initialized within a webpage?
[12:52:45] <imsky> craigwhite: it's just one attach method, with 2 calls
[12:53:11] <craigwhite> OK - I see the 2 calls now
[12:53:32] <imsky> craigwhite: are you required to pass in all new HTML?
[12:54:17] <craigwhite> I don't think my jQuery 1.3 (Learning jQuery 1.3 - awful book btw) even has the 'attach' function
[12:54:27] <imsky> it doesn't, that's not an API function
[12:54:46] <craigwhite> Yeah - the div is completely updated (which I suppose is all new html)
[12:55:38] <Eviltwin> Sounds like craigwhite needs to learn JavaScript
[12:55:45] <fission6> with jquery is their a way to post a js object to a webservice as json? ajax seems to post a querystring form
[12:55:49] <craigwhite> no argument there
[12:55:56] <craigwhite> but this book isn't going to get me there
[12:56:15] <Eviltwin> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[12:56:19] <MeirD_> Hello
[12:56:20] <Eviltwin> That will
[12:56:22] <imsky> thought you had to go
[12:56:24] <imsky> TTYL and all
[12:56:32] <craigwhite> thanks Eviltwin
[12:56:36] <Eviltwin> Well I was taking a practice final exam
[12:56:46] <Eviltwin> And couldn't solve the first question
[12:56:50] <Eviltwin> So I returned to look something up
[12:56:58] <imsky> i thought you're a greybeard, hence the snark and passive aggressiveness
[12:57:10] <imsky> GUESS NOT
[12:57:12] <Eviltwin> No, I just already know what I'm talking about
[12:57:22] <MeirD_> I get a HTML page in response from an ajax call. I try to create a jQuery object from it using $(data), but when I do that, it looks like the browser tries to load the html page that was returned in "data", since I see tons of HTTP requests being made
[12:57:25] <MeirD_> what am i doing wrong?
[12:57:30] <imsky> really? because you just told him to do something you said not to do with the first guy
[12:57:31] <imsky> lol
[12:57:57] <imsky> have fun on your finals
[12:58:10] <Eviltwin> imsky: I prefixed that solution with something about if he couldn't change the server arrangement
[12:58:42] <fission6> does jquery have a means of taking a small map object and JSON stringit, JSON.stringify(formData, null, '\t'); i see that - but curious if i can do this using ajax() directly
[12:58:49] <MeirD_> any ideas?
[13:00:01] <grid_> heya
[13:00:45] <imsky> Eviltwin: if only jquery could look into html and retrieve the necessary nodes
[13:00:50] <imsky> god wouldn't that be nice
[13:01:26] <Eviltwin> If only jQuery did everything for us so we wouldn't have to do anything
[13:01:31] <Eviltwin> That would be nicer
[13:01:39] <grid_> any helpers arround? i want to call a function in the parent from an iframe inside jquery ui dialog, i have here an example http://fiddle.jshell.net/UWTLN/1/show/# it is one of the final things i need for my site
[13:01:41] <imsky> wat
[13:01:49] <imsky> craigwhite: you still there?
[13:01:59] <craigwhite> yeah
[13:02:03] <imsky> lol i'm getting caught up being talked down to by some college freshman
[13:02:08] <imsky> anyway check this out
[13:02:24] <craigwhite> and I'm checking out the code but it's not fully working but definitely getting closer
[13:02:35] <imsky> craigwhite: go back to your original code plz
[13:02:51] <craigwhite> ok
[13:03:04] <imsky> can you pastebin/gist what the server returns?
[13:03:15] <imsky> just for referenrenrence
[13:03:45] <craigwhite> not sure how to capture that exactly - perhaps I can do something with curl/wget
[13:03:51] <imsky> whoa wtf no
[13:03:57] <imsky> what browser do you use
[13:04:05] <craigwhite> FF
[13:04:16] <imsky> ?g firebug add-ons @ craigwhite
[13:04:17] <bot-t> craigwhite, Firebug :: Add-ons for Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/
[13:04:27] <craigwhite> I have firebug
[13:04:32] <imsky> awesome, use Net tab
[13:04:46] <craigwhite> ok - let me revert my js to the original
[13:05:11] <alexfreewalker_> sorry for the noob question but why this is not working?
[13:05:11] <alexfreewalker_>   $('span[id^="f"]').click(function() {
[13:05:11] <alexfreewalker_>         var $this = $(this),
[13:05:11] <alexfreewalker_>         id = this.id.substring(1);
[13:05:11] <alexfreewalker_>      $('#best_in_place_bookmark_'+id+'_url').show();
[13:05:13] <alexfreewalker_>      $('#f'+id+'').hide();
[13:05:15] <alexfreewalker_>      return false; });
[13:05:20] <imsky> alexfreewalker_: lololol
[13:05:42] <alexfreewalker_> imsky: :P
[13:05:56] <fission6> is this the ideal way to post an js object as json to a web service http://dpaste.org/soSO9/
[13:07:07] <imsky> craigwhite: come on buddy
[13:07:20] <craigwhite> on the net tab
[13:07:28] <craigwhite> I see request & response headers
[13:07:37] <imsky> now get that response text
[13:07:54] <craigwhite> where is it?
[13:07:59] <imsky> wat
[13:08:25] <craigwhite> got it
[13:09:03] <imsky> paste that bad boy into gist or something
[13:09:23] <alexfreewalker_> seriously guyz...
[13:09:23] <alexfreewalker_>   $('span[id^="f"]').click(function() {
[13:09:23] <alexfreewalker_>         var $this = $(this),
[13:09:23] <alexfreewalker_>         id = this.id.substring(1);
[13:09:23] <alexfreewalker_>      $('#best_in_place_bookmark_'+id+'_url').show();
[13:09:24] <alexfreewalker_>      $('#f'+id).hide();
[13:09:25] <hdon> hi all :) anyone here a jquery mobile person?
[13:09:26] <alexfreewalker_>      return false; });
[13:09:29] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: use a fucking pastebin
[13:09:34] <imsky> alexfreewalker_: ok first time was forgivable
[13:09:35] <craigwhite> http://pastebin.com/p7cKRTX6
[13:09:50] <imsky> also $this = $(this) is stupid as bananas
[13:09:56] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: if you use Mac OS X get the IRC client LimeChat -- it automatically pastebins for you if you try to paste
[13:10:25] <fission6> Eviltwin: is this an ideal means of pushing a js var to a web service, http://dpaste.org/soSO9/
[13:10:50] <imsky> craigwhite: ok bud thanks for that, one sec
[13:11:02] <hdon> anyone here care to defend jquery mobile? the docs provide for a "pageinit" event. yet their 1.0 release contains not one instance of the string pageinit, and i'm trying to debug pageinit. what do i do?
[13:11:19] <alexfreewalker_> imsky i'm a rails programmer... Eviltwin gave me this var this this
[13:11:31] <imsky> alexfreewalker_: you mean a ruby programmer
[13:11:38] * hdon lols
[13:11:38] <imsky> also wow that doesn't surprise me
[13:11:52] <alexfreewalker_> rails stands for ruby on rails
[13:11:56] <alexfreewalker_> so yeah
[13:12:25] <Engin> there's this thing btw, https://github.com/plentz/jquery-maskmoney
[13:13:00] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: "rails" means "ruby on rails," but "rails programmer" might mean you don't know a thing about ruby except copying and pasting RoR code you find online :P
[13:13:10] <imsky> i'm a jabokwery programmer
[13:13:20] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: just like how "web developer" doesn't mean you know anything about javascript
[13:13:24] <imsky> the j in jquery stands for java, of course
[13:13:34] <hdon> hahaha
[13:13:34] <grid_> can someone help me here? http://fiddle.jshell.net/UWTLN/1/ really appreciated
[13:13:53] <alexfreewalker_> hdon: lol there is a bitchy singer called ruby so i always try to avoid this name'
[13:14:02] <craigwhite> I'm more of a sysadmin than a ruby or a rails developer but it doesn't stop me from pretending  ;-)
[13:14:07] <imsky> craigwhite: give me a few minutes here bud, just confirming all kinds of shit
[13:14:18] <grid_> i only look for a solution to have any parent function working in this jsfiddle
[13:14:38] <craigwhite> imsky - I've been banging my head on this for more than 2 days - not in the biggest hurry at this point  ;-)
[13:14:53] <imsky> np
[13:15:15] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: so sorry
[13:15:22] <craigwhite> and I've only got about 10 versions of the jquery code in my js file (8 of them commented out of course)
[13:15:37] <imsky> wow use git or something
[13:16:02] <craigwhite> we've got an svn server here but I haven't committed anything yet
[13:16:59] <craigwhite> but I'm getting close to having something useful
[13:17:35] <alexfreewalker_> hdon: itsok, its just I need the jquery power in this application and im overwhelmed with all those brackets and parenthesis
[13:18:01] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: guess you never programmed in lisp :P
[13:18:26] <alexfreewalker_> i used to program in perl, then i moved to ruby...
[13:20:55] <alexfreewalker_>   hdon: what does var $this = $(this), means?  a = a?
[13:21:27] <jammsen> Hi guys, did anyone know why my android browser doesnt load fully? i just make a jquery get request that comes back and is displayed, but the loading bar stops between 80 and 90 percent, anyone an idea? Code is: $.get('test.php', function(data) { $('#serverinfo').html(data); }); output is simply "test"
[13:21:37] <minna> Hello
[13:22:04] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: not at all. if you've programmed in perl you should know that $ is a valid identifier char, even at the beginning of an identifier. so $this and $ can be var names or function names. $ is a function and $() is calling $ with no arguments and $(this) is calling $ with one argument: this
[13:22:15] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: $ == jQuery
[13:22:22] <minna> I have an input that has value="" how do i make an if statement for when the value is empty? I have tried if(optionValue != "") but that did not work.
[13:23:02] <hdon> minna: x!="" would be true when it is not empty
[13:23:06] <jammsen> "" for when the value is empty?""  if(optionValue != "") <- that checks if its not empty ^^
[13:23:32] <hdon> minna: also, an empty string is falsy, so if(s){alert("s is not an empty string!")}
[13:23:46] <hdon> minna: and if(!s){alert("if s is a string then it's an empty one!")}
[13:23:54] <kborchers> alexfreewalker_: no that is a = $(a); you are caching the jquery object to be reused rather than recreating the object every time you need it. $varName is just a convention that su=ome people use. could have said var x = $(this);
[13:23:57] <jammsen> hdon: signed :o
[13:24:10] <hdon> jammsen: wat?
[13:24:18] <grid_> i will go now, see you all later
[13:24:24] <alexfreewalker_> hdon: thanks forgive my noobidity
[13:24:42] <minna> hdon: Ah yes, sorry, i mean to run an if-statement if the value is not empty. But that if statement i wrote returns true when it should return false.
[13:24:54] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: may he who is without noobidity cast the first stone
[13:25:04] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: your god(s) will judge you in the afterlife for your noobidity
[13:25:06] <jammsen> Hi guys, did anyone know why my android browser doesnt load fully? i just make a jquery get request that comes back and is displayed, but the loading bar stops between 80 and 90 percent, anyone an idea? Code is: $.get('test.php', function(data) { $('#serverinfo').html(data); }); output is simply "test"
[13:25:07] <grid_> i will try a forum on the web
[13:25:14] <minna> hdon: if(optionValue != "") should return true if the value is not empty, right?
[13:25:38] <jammsen> minna: thats right
[13:25:56] <minna> It does not
[13:26:01] <hdon> minna: your language is not precisely accurate... the code if(condition) does not "return" a value, it executes the next statement or block of statements if the condition is truthy
[13:26:17] <rhizmoe> is there a standard method i can use to detect when the mouse has been still for a period of time?
[13:26:27] <hdon> minna: please go to pastebin.com and upload your code you're having trouble with. someone will be able to help you that way
[13:26:31] <minna> hdon: Yes, but "true" runs the first statement
[13:26:46] <minna> hdon: That's what i meant :)
[13:27:10] <hdon> rhizmoe: use https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout in tandem with $(window).bind('mousemove', fn)
[13:27:17] <hdon> rhizmoe: you'll also need clearTimeout
[13:27:43] <hdon> minna: please paste your code so you can get some help
[13:27:49] <rhizmoe> hdon: ah, i was just looking at those last night anyway for something else, but the bind stuff is new. thanks for the tip
[13:28:02] <minna> hodon: That is the code :)
[13:28:08] <hdon> minna: also discover jsfiddle.net it's a great tool for producing small experiments that people can share and collaborate on for the betterment of understanding :)
[13:28:23] <hdon> minna: sorry, that is not the code, because you're wrong.
[13:28:27] <minna> hdon: I'm well aware of jsfiddle, thanks anyway :)
[13:28:33] <hdon> minna: some other factor is confusing you
[13:28:42] <minna> hdon: Yes, i think something is..
[13:28:49] <hdon> minna: i doubt you're well aware of anything because you're in here asking how to test for a blank string
[13:29:06] <minna> hdon: is testing for a blank string a bad thing?
[13:29:26] <minna> hdon: I'm fetching the default value for the first option of a select element.
[13:29:39] <minna> hdon: And the CMS happen to make that value=""
[13:29:44] <hdon> minna: being confused about it indicates that you should not be in #jquery you should be reading a book on Javascript. i recommend https://developer.mozilla.org/en/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript
[13:30:03] <minna> ....
[13:30:14] <hdon> begin at the beginning
[13:30:14] <zeejy> Is anyone in here pretty familiar with the internal of jQueryUI sortable?
[13:30:19] <snover> ?101
[13:30:19] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[13:30:54] <hdon> snover: have you read MDC's Reintro to JS? I think it's spectacular for a seasoned programmer
[13:31:00] <hdon> or probably even a novice
[13:31:07] <gnarf> ?ask @zeejy
[13:31:07] <bot-t> zeejy, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:31:08] <imsky> craigwhite: ok buddy
[13:31:13] <imsky> craigwhite: got em
[13:31:15] <craigwhite> ready
[13:31:17] <snover> EJS has been updated since 2006
[13:31:40] <hdon> zeejy: i never find anyone in here who intimately knows JQUI or JQM
[13:31:47] <snover> oh, has that page been updated too, and Moz’s wiki just sucks?
[13:32:04] <hdon> snover: idk what you mean
[13:32:16] <snover> hdon: at the bottom of the page there is a “last updated date”
[13:32:21] <snover> it says 2006
[13:32:35] <craigwhite> it was a very good year
[13:32:39] <hdon> snover: ah, true, it's been a while since i read it
[13:32:49] <snover> but actually if you mouse over the teeny tiny “this page” at the top and go to history then it shows that people have been fucking editing it for years
[13:33:12] <hdon> snover: maybe the wiki has a feature to freeze the version of the page you get by default
[13:33:32] <snover> No, I just think incompetence is rampant
[13:33:53] <zeejy> @hdon: Bummer. Thanks. I'm looking at the source right now, and the commenting is pretty poor, so wanted to clarify some things
[13:34:08] * hdon gets op from zeejay
[13:34:42] <gnarf> ?ask @zeejy
[13:34:43] <bot-t> zeejy, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:34:47] <gnarf> :)
[13:34:56] <hdon> :|
[13:35:13] <gnarf> in other words, i'm pretty familiar with jQuery UI internals in general - but sortable itself is not something I've dug into
[13:35:18] <gnarf> if you asked, i might be able to help
[13:35:45] <zeejy> Haha, love getting called out by the bot.
[13:36:06] <hdon> snover: hahaha... the part at the bottom with "last updated date" is actually part of the wiki page contents. it's probably static content. also it does say "original document information" which may refer to an original draft
[13:36:11] <hdon> but very misleading
[13:36:21] <zeejy> @gnarf, I'm trying to understand how and when calculations are being made on mouse drag to determine if the pointer has actually entered into a connected list
[13:36:41] <hdon> zeejy: search for .droppable
[13:37:02] <hdon> zeejy: i can't guarantee it uses that but jqui does have .draggable and .droppable to aid in the development of that sort (lol) of stuff
[13:37:13] <zeejy> @gnarf, I'm experiencing an occasional bug with scroll enabled on an overflowing div, where the placeholder gets confused and appears in a connected list OTHER than the one you're hovering on
[13:37:18] <imsky> craigwhite: http://jsfiddle.net/8Ft5v/4/ that should about do it
[13:37:44] <antihero> hey, can I bind an event to fire after all other events?
[13:37:49] <craigwhite> give me a min - thanks imsky
[13:37:49] <antihero> or after something is drawn?
[13:37:50] <zeejy> @hdon, Yeah, .droppable actually isn't a dependency of sortable
[13:38:05] <antihero> basically some other code draws a p after a button is clicked
[13:38:44] <gnarf> zeejy: hrm, yeah - thats a tricky portion of code for sure
[13:39:16] <antihero> and I want to do stuff to that p after it is drawn
[13:39:20] <hdon> zeejy: oh well
[13:39:21] <alexfreewalker_> hdon:  could you plaese take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/238h8/7/ pleaase
[13:39:30] <craigwhite> IMSKY - You're pure genius!
[13:39:31] * hdon looks
[13:39:46] <imsky> craigwhite: lol does it work?
[13:39:58] <craigwhite> rocking in the free world
[13:40:03] <imsky> that's what's up
[13:40:03] <craigwhite> works perfectly
[13:40:06] <zeejy> @gnarf: for sure. lots of conditionals. lots of position calculations. not sure where to start :/
[13:40:15] <imsky> craigwhite: if you need me to explain any of it, let me know
[13:40:38] <craigwhite> Ok - I need a smoke break and am going to study it
[13:40:53] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: you didn't set jQuery in your jsfiddle options. the default is mootools
[13:40:54] <gnarf> zeejy: might be worth asking in #jqueryui-dev if someone can help describe whats happening so you can try to trace a bug you're experiencing
[13:41:04] <someprimetime> how come serialize() doesn't give properly formatted json?
[13:41:08] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: make it jquery and click Update, then give me the new link
[13:41:18] <zeejy> @gnarf: Ah, good idea. I'll step in there real quick and see
[13:41:22] <someprimetime> i get something like: reviewData:ciphered_review_id=yuvma&review_user=John&location=boston
[13:41:25] <gnarf> someprimetime: serialize() gives values for a form submit... not json
[13:41:46] <gnarf> someprimetime: if you want JSON, include json2.js and use JSON.stringify()
[13:41:46] <someprimetime> gnarf: so would i have to use serializeArray and then convert them into json form?
[13:41:53] <someprimetime> ah ok
[13:43:48] <alexfreewalker_> hdon: forgive me its midnight and I was drinking and 9gaging, i should go to sleep... PS: it worked!
[13:44:07] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: :)
[13:44:12] <RoosterJuice> 9gaging?
[13:44:15] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: what is 9gaging?
[13:44:17] <RoosterJuice> my god man
[13:44:21] <RoosterJuice> imgur
[13:44:38] <RoosterJuice> only 10 year old boys use 9gag
[13:44:54] <alexfreewalker_> hdon: ttp://9gag.com/
[13:45:02] <alexfreewalker_> http
[13:45:13] <alexfreewalker_> lol
[13:45:28] <alexfreewalker_> i cant select a text
[13:45:36] <alexfreewalker_> i don't know wahts wrong
[13:46:15] <alexfreewalker_> hdon: thank you alot, and I am sorry for my situation
[13:46:26] <hdon> alexfreewalker_: noprob get some rest
[13:46:59] <zeejy> I still have no idea what 9gagging is...
[13:49:13] <someprimetime> 9gag is huge
[13:49:16] <someprimetime> don't know how they got so big
[13:56:13] <RoosterJuice> 9 gag is a crappy version of reddit / imgur
[13:56:30] <diverdude> How can you do markup in a textarea? Like making bold text, insert images, underline etc. ?
[13:56:34] <fission6> is there a better way to serialize a js object to post to a webservice, i am using JSON.stringify but affraid of browser support
[13:57:16] <Eviltwin> That's the best way, just include this incase they don't have it: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js
[13:57:39] <fission6> okay thanks
[13:57:45] <Eviltwin> It'll define it if the browser doesn't already have it
[13:57:48] <Eviltwin> Otherwise it won't do anything
[13:57:52] <fission6> ok cool.
[13:57:58] <fission6> Eviltwin: have you read javascript patterns?
[13:59:10] <rycar> if I have an image object, i.e. x = new Image(), how would I then add that image to the page?
[14:00:06] <fission6> insert it into the dom
[14:01:58] <QaDeS> hiyas. i'm making an ajax request with basic authentication. if the credentials are wrong, a browser window pops up asking for username and password. how do i prevent this?
[14:03:42] <fission6> you mean basic http authentication?
[14:04:51] <QaDeS> yep
[14:06:08] <Jon47> QaDeS you need to either authenticate or not use the protected uri
[14:06:33] <Jon47> or remove the authentication requirement..
[14:07:46] <QaDeS> thing is, i'm encrypting the credentials the user enters in a form, and then send the encrypted stuff to the server for authentication. so the popup doesn't give me anything. i want to evaluate the response from the request to let the user re-enter his password on my form
[14:08:09] <fission6> your encrypting on the client side QaDeS
[14:08:12] <fission6> ?
[14:08:14] <lilmikey> hi
[14:08:16] <QaDeS> yep
[14:08:25] <fission6> does that make sense?
[14:08:43] <QaDeS> have to make sure the plain text password never reaches our server
[14:09:08] <imsky> :V
[14:09:31] <QaDeS> it's a privacy-by-design thing ;)
[14:10:08] <QaDeS> so is there a way to prevent that standard popup?
[14:11:21] <craigwhite> imsky - you pretty much re-wrote everything... leaves me one issue but I could probably solve it another way. In my rails application, the controller tells it to 'render :partial => 'memberships' which would put contents of the javascript 'flash' hash but it isn't happening
[14:13:37] <imsky> craigwhite: ok the first 75% of that makes sense
[14:13:46] <imsky> but what the hell is a javascript flash hash
[14:13:47] <craigwhite> sorry
[14:15:23] <craigwhite> The controller is supposed to update the div - the div displays the contents of the javascript hash called 'flash'  - with your re-write, it apparently doesn't reach the html where it would be displayed
[14:15:44] <imsky> javascript hash called flash?
[14:15:51] <imsky> you mean a div with id "flash"?
[14:15:56] <craigwhite> I think this is a Rails thing (flash[:message] flash[:error] etc.)
[14:16:02] <imsky> oh that old thing
[14:16:10] <imsky> yeah i saw it in your pastebin, the message div
[14:17:50] <imsky> ok so all it'll take is this: $("#unassigned_users").before(html.closest("#message"));
[14:17:54] <craigwhite> sure - it was in there
[14:18:05] <imsky> and you can actually take the bit before the .before off and tack that on to the main unassigned_users chain
[14:18:25] <craigwhite> ok - let me play with this - it's vastly different than what I was trying to do but of course, yours works
[14:18:54] <imsky> yep, it's a bit more verbose, with a bit of work, this can all be done automatically
[14:21:50] <imsky> craigwhite: you can also do $("#member_management").prepend(html.closest("#message"));
[14:23:56] <lilmikey> I am trying to get the value of the current array item
[14:24:09] <craigwhite> do you mean $(function() { $("irc://irc.freenode.net/#member_management").prepend(html.closest("irc://irc.freenode.net/#message")); });     ?
[14:24:43] <lilmikey> using for (var i = 0, i<=myarray.length, i++)
[14:24:54] <lilmikey> how do i get the value of the current item?
[14:25:27] <imsky> lol
[14:25:36] <imsky> craigwhite: yeah that thing
[14:26:04] <danheberden> lilmikey myarray[i]
[14:26:25] <lilmikey> danheberden thanks
[14:26:27] <craigwhite> OK - I'm close - I see where it goes and I have to change it from 'prepend' to replaceWith I think - there's piling up on me
[14:26:39] <danheberden> lilmikey, also see ?jquery.each
[14:26:39] <bot-t> lilmikey, jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1.

[14:43:26] <antihero> any idea how to have an event fired after all otherrs that have already been bound?
[14:43:52] <antihero> because I want to refresh a page, but only after an ajax query has completed successfully
[14:44:39] <Jon47> antihero, so… do it to the end of your ajax success function?
[14:46:10] <antihero> Jon47: I don't control the code that's doing the original function
[14:46:57] <rroelofs> antihero:  do you have access to the jquery ajax object?
[14:48:13] <glauco29> I have a twitter widget in my page, I would like to display it after loading? This function has a callback??
[14:57:32] <hdon> glauco29: what?
[14:59:51] <devc> Dang, I'm trying to call a function in another .js file and it's saying "functionName is not defined" even though it is, and is loaded before the function is called. This is because I'm calling it from an anonymous function, I believe.
[15:00:30] <devc> is that right?
[15:01:30] <devc> Or rather, does that sound right? Are there issues with calling functions from anonymous functions? I'm guessing the named function needs to be outside jQuery's .ready() method.
[15:02:49] <Sazpaimon_> is there a way to differentiate between alt and altGr
[15:02:58] <devc> Verified. (Sorry I'm semi talking to myself, working through it in my mind). Is there a way for me to allow that function to be called from the anonymous function, but still exist inside jQuery's .ready() method?
[15:03:21] <Sazpaimon_> I have some code that uses alt+key combination to do some stuff, but its breaking interational keyboards which depend on altgr to type stuff on the keys Im binding to

[15:14:11] <JJMalina> does .select() work on checkboxes?
[15:15:19] <JJMalina> I'm trying to make a list item containing a checkbox have a class depending on the state of it being checked, what's the right event for that?
[15:15:37] <Eviltwin> JJMalina: see ?.select
[15:15:37] <bot-t> JJMalina, .select(handler): Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/select/
[15:15:49] <Eviltwin> kylemathews: No, I don't believe so
[15:17:56] <diverdude> if i have an iframe with head and body etc. inside, How do i set the cursor to text on hover over iframe? I have this: $('#wysiwyg-wysiwyg-iframe').focus().hover(function() { $(this).css('cursor','text')}); but it only changes the cursor in the edge of the iframe.
[15:17:57] <Hypah> what's the best way to go to a new page with javascript
[15:18:21] <Hypah> window.location.replace() oddly seems to not introduce the current page being left into the browser history
[15:18:40] <Eviltwin> Hypah: Correct
[15:18:48] <Eviltwin> Use window.location="..." to introduce the old page into the history
[15:18:53] <Hypah> ok thank you
[15:19:06] <JJMalina> Eviltwin it doesnt seem to be firing the select event handler
[15:19:11] <diverdude> anyone on my question?
[15:19:46] <Eviltwin> JJMalina: Clearly you didn't read that page
[15:20:03] <Eviltwin> The second sentence after the method signatures
[15:20:57] <JJMalina> You're right I didnt read that. But you didnt properly read my question then because I mention checkboxes
[15:20:59] <JJMalina> thanks
[15:21:28] <ravenzz> diverdude you can't
[15:21:42] <diverdude> ravenzz, why not
[15:21:51] <Eviltwin> JJMalina: No I read your question
[15:22:05] <ravenzz> it is logic man, because you have no control over the iframe content
[15:22:06] <Eviltwin> And I directed you to the page you should have been looking at to answer your question
[15:22:14] <Eviltwin> You were asking if .select() worked on checkboxes
[15:22:26] <Eviltwin> How do you find out? You read the API page for .select()
[15:22:45] <Eviltwin> What you are probably looking for is .change
[15:22:52] <JJMalina> sorry thought you answered my second question
[15:22:54] <Eviltwin> ?.change @ JJMalina
[15:22:55] <bot-t> JJMalina, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[15:23:01] <diverdude> ravenzz, its because i am trying to figure out how to make the cursor:text on hover on jwysiwyg
[15:23:19] <diverdude> ravenzz, and i can do iframe.focus() and that works great
[15:23:29] <diverdude> ravenzz, but hover() dont work
[15:23:43] <Eviltwin> diverdude: Why don't you use CSS instead of jQuery?
[15:23:58] <diverdude> Eviltwin, how do you mean?
[15:24:11] <Eviltwin> iframe { cursor: text } in a <style> tag or something
[15:24:21] <JJMalina> Eviltwin: works great. thank you
[15:24:29] <Eviltwin> I don't really see how this calls for jQuery
[15:25:03] <ravenzz> Eviltwin even css won't work
[15:25:55] <ravenzz> because he is going to set it to the parent element, not to the target file (the iframe src)
[15:26:19] <Hopsy> who is using klout here?

[15:27:59] <ravenzz> I don't know what klout is lol
[15:29:44] <Moddy> im using klout
[15:29:45] <Moddy> or did
[15:29:52] <Moddy> when i could be arsed with social networking
[15:30:01] <Moddy> decided it was too difficult and i was born to be a loner
[15:32:16] <Kamakazi_> anybody have a suggestion for a super simple way to embed mp3 files?
[15:32:33] <rycar> copy the wikipedia code for it
[15:33:17] <rycar> Kamakazi_: http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_audio.asp
[15:33:37] <diverdude> Eviltwin, that dont work
[15:33:45] <diverdude> Eviltwin, its exactly the same problem
[15:34:33] <diverdude> ravenzz, is there any way to go to the elements in the iframe via DOM?
[15:35:34] <rycar> diverdude: I don't think security will allow that
[15:35:56] <LordThumper> I am running this piece of Jquery
[15:35:58] <Chibby_> hi, if i have a click() listenener on a span and then a textarea inside that span, is there anyway to stop the click event firing when i click the textarea?
[15:36:20] <LordThumper> td:nth-child(2) -> How can I only search in a table of class = "testTable" for example?
[15:36:48] <Kamakazi_> rycar thanks
[15:36:52] <rycar> LordThumper: jQuery('#testTable td:nth-child(2)')
[15:37:09] <LordThumper> Thanks alot rycar :)
[15:37:17] <rycar> LordThumper: don't thank me until after it works
[15:37:28] <diverdude> how do i set cursor:text on jWYSIWYG?
[15:37:29] <rycar> I'm new to jQuery myself
[15:38:15] <rycar> diverdude: what do you mean?
[15:38:52] <diverdude> rycar, i need to have cursor:text when mouse is hovering over the jwysiwyg element
[15:39:28] <rycar> diverdude: I'm looking at a demo of jwysiwyg and it shows a cursor:text already when I hover over text
[15:39:51] <diverdude> rycar, really? What demo is that? URL?
[15:40:41] <rycar> diverdude: http://akzhan.github.com/jwysiwyg/help/examples/08-auto-grow.html   The cursor works exactly how it is supposed to in this demo
[15:41:11] <diverdude> rycar, my cursor is an arrow when i hover it
[15:41:39] <Chibby_> nvm, got it: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[15:41:45] <rycar> diverdude: that's because you are hovering over a blank spot instead of hovering over text.  try typing text in the box then hover over that
[15:42:50] <diverdude> rycar, yes but it should have cursor:text everywhere you hover
[15:43:07] <diverdude> rycar, as long as you hover over textarea
[15:43:56] <JoseBravo> Anyone know what means URUSR?
[15:44:44] <bradhe> so, mouseenter and mouseleave seems to behave strangely when attached to overlapping, absolutely-positioned elements. Is there a reason for this?
[15:45:02] <diverdude> rycar, thats normal behaviour for text field
[15:45:29] <black_warlock> guys
[15:45:36] <black_warlock> how can i find the tag ?
[15:45:41] <black_warlock> h2 tag
[15:45:56] <black_warlock> $(this).closest('#BlogList1').find('h2').toggle('slow');
[15:46:21] <black_warlock> instead to use id or class i must get the tag <h2>...how to
[15:46:27] <bradhe> find() searches descendents, so if you're looking for H2s under #BlogList1...
[15:46:44] <black_warlock> yes its right
[15:46:54] <black_warlock> infact the tag is up
[15:47:03] <black_warlock> how do i call it
[15:47:49] <diverdude> rycar, you understand?
[15:47:55] <rycar> diverdude: the body in the iframe doesn't always take up 100% of the height.  Your problem is a CSS problem and not jQuery
[15:48:17] <diverdude> rycar, so how can i solve it?
[15:48:44] <rycar> diverdude: modify the jWYSIWYG library, ask the authors to do so, or find a solution in CSS
[15:49:24] <black_warlock> nobody knows ?
[15:50:01] <diverdude> rycar, can you find a solution?
[15:51:55] <dogarrhea2> So I'm in charge of writing a test plan.. in a day for an entire client.
[15:52:44] <dogarrhea2> is there any "get element by what is above me" kind of selector?
[15:52:50] <rycar> diverdude: look in the documentation for jWYSIWYG, there are options you can set for the iframe styling.  I see something in the code called this.options.iFrameClass
[15:53:14] <diverdude> rycar, where do you see that?
[15:54:22] <rycar> diverdude: please read the documentation https://github.com/akzhan/jwysiwyg/wiki
[15:54:28] <rycar> look for iFrameClass
[15:55:42] <diverdude> rycar, but what will it help me to set the iframeclass?
[15:56:26] <diverdude> rycar, if i set curso:text in the iframeclass it has no effect on the content of the iframe anyway
[15:58:07] <rycar> diverdude: welcome to the world of iframes
[15:58:34] <diverdude> rycar, no there must be some way to do this
[15:58:55] <rycar> diverdude: do you have Firebug installed?
[15:59:02] <dogarrhea2> ok got it. need GetSibling
[15:59:20] <diverdude> rycar, yes
[16:00:09] <rycar> use it to see how the iframe is organized.  You'll be able to see how big the body is in the iframe, and then it might make sense.  The body doesn't take up the full height of the editor
[16:01:21] <diverdude> rycar, how can body not take up the full size? everything must be in the body tag
[16:08:23] <diverdude> rycar, it cannot be done
[16:16:44] <LordThumper> How do you debug JQuery (Javascript)?
[16:16:59] <LordThumper> Using Chrome FireBug lite?
[16:17:02] <dfcowell> LordThumper - your browser's development tools
[16:17:04] <dfcowell> Or that.
[16:17:18] <dfcowell> You should just be able to use the scripts panel in Chrome.
[16:17:58] <LordThumper> Ok, I don't think a minified .js can be easily debugged...
[16:18:15] <dfcowell> So download the dev file from jquery.com
[16:18:28] <LordThumper> Will do, thanks
[16:19:05] <Jayflux> does john resig know that jQuery 1.7 breaks his color plugin?
[16:19:21] <LordThumper> I know this might sound stupid, but can a memory leak be a problem in javascript?
[16:19:36] <LordThumper> One particular plugin is slowing down after heavy use
[16:20:54] <erichynds> yup
[16:22:03] <dfcowell> If you want to see evidence of a memory leak in javascript, leave facebook open for a couple of hours idle.
[16:27:28] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: http://jsfiddle.net/kYNFc/1/
[16:27:49] <Eviltwin> Every 50ms the memory footprint for this basically triples
[16:28:02] <Eviltwin> Sorry, doubles
[16:28:06] <Eviltwin> The old ones get GC'd
[16:32:03] <LordThumper> Thanks Eviltwin
[16:32:35] <LordThumper> Is that a recursive function?
[16:32:46] <Eviltwin> Yes and no
[16:32:56] <Eviltwin> Yes in that it causes itself to be called again
[16:33:01] <Eviltwin> No in that it doesn't actually call itself directly
[16:33:20] <LordThumper> Just did a while(true) in the Google developer tool and the tab hanged
[16:33:27] <Eviltwin> Yes
[16:33:29] <LordThumper> Ah never used the jquery extend
[16:33:34] <Eviltwin> That's because JavaScript is single-threaded
[16:33:42] <Eviltwin> And if you make something tie up that thread
[16:33:45] <Eviltwin> The browser hangs
[16:33:48] <LordThumper> Yeah, the problem is i cannt force close the process tab
[16:34:11] <dfcowell> Heh.
[16:34:14] <LordThumper> Chrome has a process per thread
[16:34:21] <LordThumper> so only the tab hangs fortunately
[16:34:30] <Eviltwin> What this does is wait 50ms in between calls to the function
[16:34:34] <LordThumper> however it is telling me (tab hanged) error or something
[16:34:35] <Eviltwin> So the browser has time to do work in there
[16:34:48] <LordThumper> it is not telling me *
[16:34:49] <dfcowell> Time to find the process in your OS's task manager and kill it that way then I guess.
[16:34:55] <LordThumper> ye i will do that
[16:34:58] <dfcowell> That's because the tab hasn't hanged.
[16:35:03] <dfcowell> It's still evaluating true.
[16:35:05] <dfcowell> ;)
[16:35:11] <LordThumper> Ah I see :)
[16:35:24] <LordThumper> Atleast I can get the process id easily :)
[16:35:25] <Eviltwin> Well
[16:35:29] <Eviltwin> How do you define "hang"?
[16:35:44] <dfcowell> Fine.  According to Chrome's definition of "hang" it hasn't hanged.
[16:35:48] <LordThumper> I cannot close the tab. Nor open developer tools on it
[16:36:17] <LordThumper> Would all Firefox tabs stop responding if I ran the same script?
[16:36:40] <dfcowell> Depends on how Firefox's Javascript engine works.
[16:36:48] <dfcowell> You're welcome to give it a go.
[16:36:51] <LordThumper> Ok.
[16:38:15] <snover> Firefox does not have process isolation
[16:38:41] <MugginsM> so I'm trying to do a jquery-ui accordion, but I'd like some way to put a little toolbar between the sections (with things like "insert new section" on it). Any hints?
[16:38:51] <LordThumper> Ok
[16:38:55] <LordThumper> Firefox hangs entirely
[16:38:58] <Eviltwin> Then again process isolation shouldn't really be necessary to prevent a browser from freezing up and crashing
[16:39:04] <dfcowell> Exactly.
[16:39:11] <LordThumper> But an Messagebox show telling me " A script on this page is busy"
[16:39:14] <LordThumper> a*
[16:39:18] <LordThumper> shows*
[16:39:21] <LordThumper> frozen fingers :/
[16:39:49] <dfcowell> So the process doesn't hang, it just doesn't halt the script either.
[16:39:53] <dfcowell> Cool.
[16:40:26] <LordThumper> It does stop the script when the error message is displayed though
[16:40:33] <dfcowell> Yeah.
[16:40:39] <dfcowell> So it's smart about it.
[16:40:43] <dfcowell> Which is nice.
[16:40:54] <LordThumper> It is
[16:42:37] <LordThumper> Ok, I am going to try allocating memory in a recursive function to see how GC works on the V8
[16:43:02] <dfcowell> ...
[16:43:12] <dfcowell> If it's a recursive function the GC won't clear it.
[16:43:21] <dfcowell> Not until the last iteration returns.
[16:43:35] <LordThumper> Oh?
[16:43:41] <LordThumper> Until the stack empties?
[16:43:45] <dfcowell> No scope in Javascript remember.
[16:43:55] <LordThumper> oh right
[16:44:04] <Eviltwin> "No scope in Javascript"?
[16:44:42] <dfcowell> Well, not entirely accurate.  But variables declared inside a block are -generally- accessible outside of the block.
[16:44:53] <dfcowell> An exception being functions, so I guess that would work.
[16:45:21] <Eviltwin> Variables declared inside any function block are local to that function
[16:45:29] <dfcowell> Yeah.
[16:45:29] <Eviltwin> Local to that call of the function in fact
[16:45:38] <dfcowell> I got myself confused.
[16:45:39] <Eviltwin> Closure
[16:46:08] <chilversc> right, so the scope of a variable declared in a function is that function, trouble with a recursive function is that function is still executing so might not be GCable depending on how the GC works for tracking a variables lifetime
[16:46:16] <dfcowell> Exactly.
[16:46:24] <Eviltwin> Yes, however in my example
[16:46:31] <dfcowell> Though a way around that would be a recursive function that calls another function that allocates memory before recursing.
[16:46:36] <Eviltwin> I believe it is GC'd because the function actually returns
[16:46:47] <Eviltwin> It may not be GC'd until the second child call
[16:47:00] <LordThumper> Yeah will see how it goes with a recursive new Array(10000);
[16:47:06] <dfcowell> Eviltwin - the recursive function won't return until the final recursion returns, which then allows the recursion to fallover up the call stack.
[16:47:13] <Eviltwin> Eww new Array(...)
[16:47:21] <dfcowell> *return
[16:47:23] <dfcowell> not recusion.
[16:47:26] <dfcowell> gah.
[16:47:28] <Eviltwin> dfcowell: Did you see my example?
[16:47:35] <dfcowell> Don't think so.
[16:47:50] <dfcowell> ah
[16:47:51] <dfcowell> got it.
[16:47:52] <Eviltwin> This: http://jsfiddle.net/kYNFc/1/
[16:47:54] <dfcowell> looking at it now
[16:48:02] <chilversc> well it all depends upon how the GC works and determins when an object is no longer used (its lifetime), eg in .Net the GC can actually collect "this" whilst executing an instance member :)
[16:48:35] <ProLoser|Work> what's the best js fw?
[16:48:39] <ProLoser|Work> anyone use knockout?
[16:50:05] <black_warlock> parent() what does indicate
[16:50:24] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: English, please
[16:51:35] <dfcowell> black_warlock - If you're asking what I think you are, the element that contains the object it's called on in the DOM tree.
[16:56:16] <black_warlock> oke i have red the description
[16:56:33] <dfcowell> I've just come up against a problem I've had a few times before in the past.  Is there any reason in particular that <form> and </form> tags are stripped when setting contents with .html()?
[16:56:34] <black_warlock> i dunno how to change the arrow on this script

[17:03:20] <LordThumper> Ok disappoint :/ Got a too much recursion error, and everything was GC
[17:04:20] <dfcowell> No local variables in a recursive function will be GC until the recursive function returns.
[17:04:54] <dfcowell> It's only after the functions the variables are declared in exits the call stack (ie, returns) that the GC will collect them.
[17:05:16] <LordThumper> Yes i set local variables in the recursive function
[17:05:35] <LordThumper> Oh I understand your statement now
[17:05:38] <dfcowell> Which won't be cleaned up until the recursion ends.
[17:05:39] <dfcowell> Yeah.
[17:06:08] <dfcowell> The function recurses synchronously.
[17:06:32] <LordThumper> Yeah until javascript is multi-threaded ;p
[17:06:59] <LordThumper> No classes in javascript right? What was that google wrapper that added classes?
[17:07:15] <dfcowell> Even then, it'll still recurse synchronously unless it's implemented to spawn worker threads.
[17:07:30] <dfcowell> Not sure LordThumper.
[17:09:32] <LordThumper> Found it. http://www.dartlang.org/
[17:11:55] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/yej88/16/ why does cliking the dark green box always print a position().left of 0?
[17:12:31] <dfcowell> Looking at this thread: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/is-jquery-stripping-form-tags  - A suggested workaround is using append, but that isn't working in 1.7.1 - I'm aware this is a Javascript problem, but does anyone know of any workarounds to keep form tags in inserted HTML?
[17:12:37] <Raydiation> is  $.getJSON bugged?
[17:12:54] <Raydiation> it does not execute my callback even after successfull get
[17:14:54] <dogarrhea2> oh ok
[17:14:59] <dogarrhea2> it's not event stuff it's element position
[17:18:41] <donCams> noob question: what does this mean? lum = lum || 0;
[17:19:50] <LordThumper> Dont think you can do that
[17:19:51] <hdon> donCams: in many very high level languages like javascript, boolean operators do not coerce values to booleans
[17:20:09] <LordThumper> if (i == 0 || i == 1)
[17:20:22] <hdon> donCams: basically, if (x) then (x || y) == x. if (!x) then (x || y) == y
[17:20:26] <LordThumper> Basically if the first is met, the first is not even checked
[17:20:42] <hdon> LordThumper: ?
[17:20:52] <hdon> LordThumper: you're thinking of C/C++/Java etc.
[17:21:12] <LordThumper> Oh sorry then
[17:22:20] <donCams> THANKS
[17:22:22] <donCams> ooops
[17:22:51] <donCams> ok. i'm trying to convert javascript function to php, i wonder if these functions does the same http://pastebin.com/SAsCaLTP
[17:24:36] <fris> doncams what does it do?
[17:25:24] <donCams> fris: get's the value of the brighter/darker color based on luminance
[17:25:54] <fris> so #336699, 20
[17:26:15] <donCams> yep
[17:26:24] <donCams> negative values return darker
[17:26:25] <QaDeS> but it should convert to web-compatible colors _after_ applying the luminance, not before. no?
[17:26:31] <donCams> got function from sitepoint
[17:28:20] <donCams> hmmm
[17:36:42] <Eviltwin> donCams: You can't use []'s on a string in JavaScript
[17:37:09] <Eviltwin> You can use the substr approch like they do
[17:37:22] <donCams> yep. figured
[17:37:51] <Eviltwin> donCams: You could also do var a=hex.split("");
[17:37:59] <Eviltwin> At which point a is an array of the characters of hex
[17:39:18] <Eviltwin> Or you could be sneaky and do if(hex.length < 6) hex = hex.replace(/(.)/g,"$1$1")
[17:42:34] <donCams> thanks :)
[17:43:03] <Eviltwin> Also you can do for(i = 0; i < 6; i += 2) instead of for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
[17:43:04] <Raydiation> using url(r'^password/$', 'password_change', {'template_name': 'config/password_change.html'}, name='password_change'), gives me a Reverse for 'django.contrib.auth.views.password_change_done' with arguments '()' and keyword arguments '{}' not found.
[17:43:10] <Eviltwin> And drop the i*2 business
[17:43:45] <Eviltwin> Raydiation: This is #jQuery...
[17:43:58] <donCams> thanks for all those Eviltwin
[17:44:04] <donCams> i guess you're not Evil
[17:44:42] <Raydiation> sry
[17:45:43] <Eviltwin> I try not to be
[17:45:49] <Eviltwin> But at some level I always am
[17:46:21] <diverdude> rycar, i dropped that lib
[17:47:12] <rycar> the cursor bugged you that much?
[17:47:37] <Sazpaimon_> does anyone know of a way to detect if altgr is pressed instead of alt?
[17:48:00] <Sazpaimon_> i wanted to bind some controls to alt+;, but that also detects altgr+; which is a tilde on danish keyboards
[17:48:04] <Sazpaimon_> and it screws it up
[17:48:18] <Eviltwin> donCams: Also, there's a lot of code already out there for manipulations like this that you might want to take a look at
[17:48:22] <Eviltwin> Like this for example: http://mjijackson.com/2008/02/rgb-to-hsl-and-rgb-to-hsv-color-model-conversion-algorithms-in-javascript
[17:50:45] <rycar> donCams: http://pastebin.com/cXAfkBvx
[17:54:15] <donCams> uhm... thanks
[17:55:23] <diverdude> rycar, yes
[17:55:47] <diverdude> rycar, and compared to the really good CKEditor it really seem to dwarf
[17:55:57] <diverdude> rycar, so im using that one instead
[17:56:10] <diverdude> its fast, lean, mean and furious
[17:56:14] <diverdude> WHAAAA
[17:56:19] <diverdude> ;D
[18:09:20] <rycar> diverdude: dang, look at how many buttons are on that toolbar
[18:09:29] <diverdude> rycar, so?
[18:09:39] <diverdude> rycar, they can be removed
[18:09:52] <rycar> diverdude: I'm just saying, that's a LOT of features
[18:10:05] <rycar> thing looks way more powerful than the other one
[18:12:13] <diverdude> rycar, yes
[18:12:22] <diverdude> its industry standard it seems
[18:20:59] <catcher> Does anyone get paid to maintain the jquery library?
[18:24:53] <vladikoff> catcher, http://jquery.org/donate/
[18:30:41] <snover> vladikoff: that does not really answer the question
[18:30:48] <snover> nice try though
[18:35:59] <chuck_tes> is jquery superior to javascript?
[18:36:15] <snover> sigh.
[18:36:21] <PrgmrBill> I see what you did there.
[18:37:18] <chuck_tes> oh i see, jquery is composed of javascript. but is there like some other alternative to using jquery? Like maybe Squery or puppyquery?
[18:37:38] <snover> y u trollin bro.
[18:37:51] <chuck_tes> i am not trolling.
[18:38:06] <PrgmrBill> I use puppyquery
[18:38:17] <chuck_tes> ok nm.
[19:01:01] <arepie> if i created a dynamic form, and the input fields are array eg: <input type="text" name="text[]"> how to get the value?
[19:01:06] <BigBiff_> anyone awake? I've got some strange behavior in chrome with finding the offset.top of an element when the page cache is empty
[19:01:28] <BigBiff_> links ok?
[19:04:43] <BigBiff_> arepie: http://api.jquery.com/val/   ?
[19:09:25] <ed1t> how do i pre-populate a datepicker text field with todays date.....I tried doing $("#start_date").datepicker('setDate', new Date()); but it doesn't work
[19:09:34] <dfcowell> arepie - PHP?
[19:10:21] <arepie> dfcowell: jquery + php
[19:10:23] <dfcowell> If so - $_POST['text'][x]
[19:10:35] <dfcowell> Ah.
[19:10:46] <nickadeemus2002> @ed1t: $( ".selector" ).datepicker({ defaultDate: +7 });
[19:10:52] <dfcowell> For jQuery...  I've done it before.
[19:10:57] <dfcowell> Let me have a look.
[19:11:39] <arepie> in a dynamic form, i create an input to set the img path link and the form may expand and remove by lines..
[19:11:50] <arepie> i use a filemanager to get the img path
[19:12:01] <ed1t> nickadeemus2002: that doesn't work either
[19:12:04] <arepie> the problem is, to set the input field
[19:12:10] <arepie> the value
[19:12:21] <wtfizzle> I recall having to do something ugly like… $( … ).datepicker().datepicker( 'setDate', … )
[19:12:31] <wtfizzle> Not sure if it was the best way to do it, but I solved the issue by chaining it
[19:12:56] <dfcowell> I'd guess you would just use $('input[name="text[x]"]
[19:13:08] <dfcowell> gah
[19:13:11] <dfcowell> pressed enter too soon
[19:13:14] <dfcowell> but you get what I mean.
[19:13:15] <arepie> lolx
[19:13:17] <arepie> yeah
[19:13:20] <arepie> i try it first
[19:15:00] <arepie> dfcowell: $('input[name="imgpathlink[' + FieldArr + ']"]').val(fileUrl);
[19:15:08] <arepie> not working
[19:15:22] <arepie> FieldArr is the number of the array input
[19:15:33] <dfcowell> Hmm.  Ok.
[19:15:35] <dfcowell> Oh.
[19:15:36] <dfcowell> Wait.
[19:15:47] * dfcowell facepalms.
[19:15:54] <dfcowell> My brain went away for a sec there sorry.
[19:16:48] <dfcowell> $('input[name^="imgpathlink"]') will get you all of them and then just access each index as usual.
[19:17:55] * arepie blur
[19:18:04] <nickadeemus2002> @ed1t:  let's try it out...http://jsfiddle.net/nickadeemus2002/EjYBT/
[19:20:21] <arepie> dfcowell, do you mean index them by for() ?
[19:22:16] <wtfizzle> I just updated that test: http://jsfiddle.net/EjYBT/1/
[19:23:33] <arepie> dfcowell: http://pastebin.com/3zvpXQ0L please look at this
[19:24:42] <dfcowell> Do you have a HTML page I could have a look at?
[19:25:08] <dfcowell> Actually, I understand how that side of it works.
[19:25:20] <dfcowell> Just need to remember how I did it.  I can't find the code on this machine.
[19:25:52] <marvwhere> hey there is there a better way then this: $(this).next().children('.shadowbox-content').toggleClass("hovered"); - to get the child of the following (directly) div element
[19:26:12] <marvwhere> i trigger this on a hover
[19:27:06] <twolfson_> save your query outside of the hover function
[19:27:15] <twolfson_> so it stops querying each time
[19:28:05] <twolfson_> also slap an id on the sibling of 'this' so you can just go var $shadowContent = $('#id').children('.shadowbox-content');
[19:28:26] <Eviltwin> marvwhere: Is there more than one of these?
[19:28:34] <Eviltwin> If there are, don't use ids
[19:29:03] <marvwhere> yeah 3 of them...
[19:29:13] <wtfizzle> Yea, it looks fairly clean from what I can tell… obviously caching lookups is good if possible
[19:29:20] <dfcowell> arepie - give this a go:  $('input[name^="imgpathlink"]').filter('[name*="' + i + '"]').val()
[19:30:32] <arepie> dfcowell: the code is not online, im doing it in my local pc
[19:30:41] <arepie> give me a minute
[19:30:44] <dfcowell> Ok.
[19:32:56] <arepie> dfcowell: no error, but not working
[19:33:10] <dfcowell> Odd.
[19:36:30] <dfcowell> Can you modify the generated HTML to put a data attribute, e.g. data-fileindex="1"?
[19:36:55] <wtfizzle> I believe so
[19:36:56] <dfcowell> That way you'd be able to use that as a selector, which would be a lot cleaner.
[19:37:07] <dfcowell> Sorry, I'm offering a suggestion for arepie.  ;)
[19:37:26] <dfcowell> Should have made that a bit clearer.
[19:37:45] <wtfizzle> ah =p
[19:39:20] <webPragmatist> any superfish users …. has no method 'superfish' << :(
[19:40:15] <arepie> dfcowell: http://pastebin.com/7n6Gb2WV line 455
[19:40:48] <arepie> the js is not shown because it is dynamically calledfrom the index page
[19:41:32] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ arepie
[19:41:32] <bot-t> arepie, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[19:41:50] <Eviltwin> It's your job to narrow down your problem
[19:41:58] <dfcowell> Yeah.
[19:42:01] <dfcowell> Pretty much that.
[19:42:35] <arepie> of course..
[19:42:54] <arepie> im just asking how to set the value into an array input :)
[19:43:06] <arepie> the html is only to show u the generated code
[19:43:15] <arepie> from my php file
[19:43:36] <dfcowell> Ok.  So you can modify the PHP file, yes?
[19:45:20] <arepie> yes
[19:45:22] <dfcowell> Because if you add an attribute to each input which includes a numeric index (and yes, that can be implemented in dynamically-generated Javascript input fields too) then you'll have a much easier time implementing this.
[19:46:09] <dfcowell> <input type="text" name="text[]" data-imageindex="1">
[19:46:12] <dfcowell> that kind of thing.
[19:46:22] <dfcowell> Have the data-imageindex attribute increment for each field.
[19:46:36] <dfcowell> Then use a selector based on that attribute to get the right field.
[19:46:58] <arepie> i see
[19:47:39] <arepie> i try to implement it, after this.. thank you for your suggestion
[19:47:41] <arepie> :)
[19:52:18] <webPragmatist1> anyone know how to tell if a plugin has been installer?
[19:52:20] <webPragmatist1> installed*
[19:52:27] <webPragmatist1> i have no clue how to troubleshoot this
[19:52:50] <webPragmatist1> there's no method called "superfish" but it's embeded
[19:53:26] <Rotham_> hey.. for a button .my-button, how would I get the nearest ancestor <tr> tag?
[19:53:28] <coldhead> if ($.fn.superfish) will usually suffice
[19:53:42] <Eviltwin> If there's no method superfish, there's no superfish
[19:53:49] <Eviltwin> It's not loaded correctly
[19:53:49] <coldhead> ?closest @ Rotham_
[19:53:49] <bot-t> Rotham_, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:54:54] <Rotham_> coldhead: badass thank you.. jquery is to javascript what backhoe's are to digging diches
[19:55:56] <Eviltwin> I suppose that's one way of looking at it
[19:57:30] <coldhead> well said Rotham_
[19:57:56] <coldhead> i hope javascript is as close as i ever come to ditch digging
[19:58:33] <Eviltwin> I had to bury a man after I killed him
[19:58:39] <Eviltwin> So I unfortunately had to dig a ditch for that
[19:58:51] <Rotham_> i grew up on a farm
[19:58:51] <coldhead> you're supposed to make the victim dig their own grave
[19:58:55] <coldhead> protip for next time
[19:58:59] <Eviltwin> He was already dead
[19:59:02] <coldhead> it's very humiliating for them
[19:59:03] <Eviltwin> It was too late to make him dig
[19:59:28] <coldhead> and you can say like "is that REALLY good enough for you to spend eternity in? don't you deserve drainage channels?"
[19:59:31] <dfcowell> $('#victim').css(['display':'none','visibility','hidden'])?
[19:59:44] <Eviltwin> dfcowell: {}'s instead of []'s
[19:59:48] <dfcowell> Oh.  Right.
[20:00:01] <dfcowell> That's what I get for mixing PHP and jQuery.
[20:00:10] <dfcowell> Don't script and drive, kids.
[20:00:35] * dfcowell is on a bit of a high because he just secured a new job.
[20:00:51] <lpdahito> Hi guys! I was wondering if there's a clean way to add big chunks of html code to a page... All the examples I've looked at on the web use AJAX to retrieve some code from the server... I don't wanna hit the server... I just wanna add fields to an html form... I know how to do this... I just don't like the fact that all the HTML code I'll be adding to my page is stored inside a variable (string)... thank you for helping
[20:01:14] <Eviltwin> lpdahito: So what do you propose?
[20:01:21] <Eviltwin> Elements out of thin air?
[20:03:50] <coldhead> lpdahito: you are in the market for one of the many jquery/javascript clientside templating solutions
[20:03:55] <lpdahito> member:identifier:eviltwin I use to be able to do it with helper methods, partials and ERB with rails 2.*.* but now since the upgrade to 3.1 I can't fetch the html string dynamically and end up with pretty messy js files
[20:04:15] <coldhead> consider mustache.js
[20:08:04] <lpdahito> coldhead I've seen it before... Think ill give it a try
[20:08:22] <lpdahito> thank you!
[20:08:36] <coldhead> good luck babe
[20:10:53] <chuck_tes> just to confirm, jquery IS javascript right?
[20:10:59] <danzik17> coldhead: curious - what would you use for a compilable template lib?  looking at handlebars, but more options is always good
[20:12:39] <coldhead> 100% pure javascript, yes chuck_tes
[20:12:58] <coldhead> anything but jquery tmpl basically, danzik17
[20:13:13] <coldhead> there are so many, and they're all evolving
[20:13:17] <coldhead> whatever you like the syntax of will do
[20:13:45] <oojacoboo> how can I check to see if a string contains something?
[20:14:03] <oojacoboo> in this case, data
[20:14:08] <crab> poor jquery-tmpl
[20:14:15] <danzik17> coldhead: yep, just going through them.  "beta" seems to be the word of the day, so i'm trying to choose one from a dev that i feel won't be going anywhere ( ykatz fits that bill for sure )
[20:14:33] <danzik17> that said, mustache.js isn't compilable :(   there's MU for node, but it hasn't been updated in almost 2 years
[20:14:45] <danzik17> well, 1.5 yrs.
[20:14:53] <coldhead> yeah, pick an active one :)
[20:15:08] <crab> mustaches need constant maintenance.
[20:17:37] <TimothyA> is there a way I can see what lines of javascript code change a specific dom element?
[20:21:08] <oojacoboo> am I correct in assuming that js treats all vars as arrays?
[20:21:21] <gkatsev> you are no
[20:21:23] <gkatsev> t
[20:21:30] <oojacoboo> so, using inArray() is ok on a var?
[20:23:11] <TimothyA> no? no way to figure out what functions are altering a DOM element?
[20:25:23] <dfcowell> Nope, you can't put a watch on the DOM.
[20:25:50] <dfcowell> Or rather, a breakpoint.  You could step through your script and observe the results though.
[20:26:38] <TimothyA> dfcowell: I've tried to set a breakpoint on altering the node's attributes...
[20:26:47] <TimothyA> but the attributes never seem to change :|
[20:26:59] <TimothyA> it's an input date element that I'm trying to reset
[20:27:06] <dfcowell> ...so then the element isn't being altered.
[20:27:23] <TimothyA> but it is altered :| but it isn't at the same time
[20:28:28] <TimothyA> e.g. $('input').val('') doesn't set the value attribute of the input elements to nothing :/
[20:28:41] <TimothyA> but it says it does when I ask the value information!
[20:30:30] <TimothyA> yeah, even the basic form controls don't even work :|
[20:30:41] <TimothyA> <input type="reset"> does not reset date input fields >_<
[20:31:56] <baldaris> i am trying to acheive mouse click event to show and hide divs,problem is divs id are generated using php ,http://pastebin.com/pydSeEvC in my php script i added a class which hides all the divs , when i click on mavigation lia it removes the class..works fine till them , but when i click again the prev div stays and a new div is reveled..been breaking my head over this for past 4 days...
[20:32:05] <TimothyA> ugh
[20:32:22] <TimothyA> screw it, I'm making it a regular input field
[20:35:14] <crab> hi ajpiano.
[20:37:18] <TimothyA> okay, so there is no way to set the date input value to nothing?
[20:38:08] <EchoBravo> timothy: is there a pastebin or something?
[20:39:14] <crab> what should i read to understand the $(document).ready() vs. $(window).load() vs. whatever tradeoffs?
[20:39:24] <TimothyA> EchoBravo: unfortunately, no
[20:39:29] <TimothyA> and I don't feel like making one at 1AM
[20:39:36] <TimothyA> I've been balking against this issue for 10 hours
[20:39:48] <EchoBravo> timothy: gl then.
[20:40:08] <TimothyA> what's the site again with the evaluating javascript?
[20:40:55] <EchoBravo> jsfiddle.net
[20:40:56] <crab> jsfiddle
[20:41:16] <EchoBravo> crab: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=window.onload+vs+document.ready
[20:41:34] <TimothyA> EchoBravo: http://jsfiddle.net/SnLh5/
[20:42:00] <TimothyA> meh, correct it to say 'ready' instead, same result
[20:44:31] <EchoBravo> http://jsfiddle.net/SnLh5/2/
[20:45:48] <TimothyA> yeah, sorry, moment while I write the more complete example
[20:45:52] <TimothyA> http://jsfiddle.net/SnLh5/4/
[20:48:14] <TimothyA> it will just put the old value back
[20:51:36] <TimothyA> EchoBravo: making anything of it?
[20:56:41] <morficus> quick question: when using $.ajax() with dataType: jsonp - does the beforeSend() trigger not fire?
[20:58:28] <dnsdds> I have a long stack of animations that I would need to delay 150 ms only if an if statement is true. Is there a neat way of adding such an if without creating a new function?
[20:59:48] * TimothyA pokes EchoBravo with a stick?
[21:00:10] <morficus> less poking with sticks, more answering of questions :-p
[21:00:27] <TimothyA> my problems requires an answer, too :P
[21:00:38] <EchoBravo> tim: sorry, ran out for a smoke
[21:00:49] <TimothyA> ah, okies
[21:01:56] <oojacoboo> so, I need to evaluate the returned data object form an ajax query to see if it contains a string.  What would be the best way to go about doing this?
[21:02:48] <oojacoboo> I want to evaluate it to see if it contains a string before I do a split, I'm passing back a record id for passing along to another function
[21:02:50] <morficus> oojacoboo: what is the returned data type?
[21:03:03] <oojacoboo> it's just a string like…. transaction-12345
[21:03:20] <oojacoboo> data is equal to that or to 1 or nothing if it fails
[21:04:27] <EchoBravo> tim: http://jsfiddle.net/SnLh5/6/
[21:04:45] <EchoBravo> works great if you use a button :}
[21:04:50] <oojacoboo> I'm not sure if that method is the best way of going about this, but I need to pass back a record id if a specific action was done, otherwise not pass it back and then there are subsequent events based on it if the id is included
[21:05:25] <TimothyA> ugh!
[21:06:15] <oojacoboo> morficus: do I need to use regex or is there a function for this?
[21:06:40] <morficus> you could prolly just use normal javascript... returnedData.indexOf()
[21:06:53] <oojacoboo> I tried inArray)(
[21:06:55] <oojacoboo> ()*
[21:07:06] <morficus> did you try indexOf()?
[21:07:09] <EchoBravo> tim: better solution: just return false in the click event
[21:07:17] <oojacoboo> morficus: not yet, I will
[21:07:30] <morficus> it's not a jQuery function. just "raw" JS
[21:07:44] <Liquide> anyone see any apparent reason why this wouldn't work in Opera of all things, it doesn't work in Opera but succeeds in all other browsers >>> http://pastebin.com/XVXMijEA
[21:07:58] <morficus> oojacoboo: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof.asp  (incase you aren't familiar with it)
[21:08:33] <morficus> Liquide: because it's Opera? :-p
[21:09:10] <Liquide> Opera actually has a decent javascript engine, the annoying thing is that it chokes on row 15, the template/append function
[21:09:23] <Liquide> but doesn't cast an error at all
[21:10:01] <Liquide> its like if Opera encounters it, looks at the function and thinks it is too much work and just continue without something else without giving you notice
[21:11:49] <morficus> does anyone know if when using $.ajax() with dataType: jsonp - does the beforeSend() trigger not fire?
[21:17:27] <scorphus> how on earth do you develop for such a stinking piece of crap? namely IE http://soledadpenades.com/2007/05/17/arrayindexof-in-internet-explorer/
[21:17:49] <scorphus> I tell my clients "I develop for browsers, IE is not a browser"
[21:18:04] <scorphus> "please install a browser"
[21:18:20] <oojacoboo> morficus: that did the trick, thanks.  The jquery docs were saying that inArray() was effectively the same thing, but it doesn't work nearly as well
[21:18:29] <oojacoboo> at least for a string
[21:18:54] <morficus> yeah, I think that is meant to iterate over a collection of some sort
[21:19:00] <morficus> glad it worked :-)
[21:19:10] <morficus> now if only I could fix my problems :-(
[21:19:12] <oojacoboo> yea, like php in_array() I'd think
[21:19:15] <mariocoupland> hey there people, i am doing a slider that has a <ul> width children inside, and i am doing it fullscreen, the problem is when the window resizes, it gets the wrong window.innerwidth, does anyone have a doubt on how resolve this?
[21:19:38] <oojacoboo> morficus: I wouldn't think the dataType would matter there
[21:19:43] <mariocoupland> cause i am moving the parent ul back and forth
[21:20:11] <oojacoboo> why would that make a difference with the beforeSend()?
[21:20:56] <morficus> that's what I would like to know.  when I have dataType: JSON ... the stuff I put in beforeSend() execute just fine
[21:21:05] <morficus> but when I'm using JSONP... they never execute
[21:21:07] <zeen> looking to make the selected tab with jquery ui tabs clickable always, any clues?
[21:22:07] <oojacoboo> morficus: that doesn't appear to be a supported dataType
[21:22:12] <oojacoboo> http://docs.jquery.com/Specifying_the_Data_Type_for_AJAX_Requests
[21:23:41] <qawsedrf> isnt this crazy http://i.imgur.com/tacV8.png ? :)
[21:23:51] <TimothyA> EchoBravo: why does it *have* to be a button?
[21:24:21] <morficus> qawsedrf: not really
[21:24:29] <EchoBravo> timothy: do it the way you had it originally, except return false at the end of the click event.
[21:24:30] <morficus> textarea doesn't have a "value" atribute ;-)
[21:24:48] <morficus> input elements do tho
[21:25:07] <TimothyA> EchoBravo: doesn't work :/
[21:25:25] <EchoBravo> timothy: http://jsfiddle.net/SnLh5/7/
[21:25:30] <morficus> qawsedrf: if you want to get the content of a <textarea> you prolly want to use .html() in palce of .val()
[21:26:15] <ryanneufeld> Hey guys, I'm baaaack
[21:27:02] <morficus> and I'm out
[21:27:04] <morficus> g'night
[21:27:40] <TimothyA> blargh!
[21:27:47] <TimothyA> time for sleep now, thanks EchoBravo
[21:32:41] <mariocoupland> hey there people, i am doing a slider that has a <ul> width children inside, and i am doing it fullscreen, the problem is when the window resizes, it gets the wrong window.innerwidth, does anyone have a doubt on how resolve this?cause i am moving the parent ul back and forth
[21:33:59] <oojacoboo> OMG $.ajax and pop-up blocking
[21:34:04] <oojacoboo> FML
[21:35:47] <oojacoboo> are there any hacks around the delay between a click and a pop-up?
[21:35:53] <oojacoboo> to get around the pop-up blocking
[21:39:03] <Cork> oojacoboo: you mean to delay when the popup comes up after a click?
[21:39:12] <oojacoboo> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1086672/popup-blocked-jquery-window-open-in-success-ajax-outside-ok
[21:39:25] <oojacoboo> I'm hoping that'll do the trick
[21:39:35] <oojacoboo> I thought it was a delay issue...
[21:39:47] <Cork> no, you can't do that
[21:39:53] <Cork> ajax is async
[21:40:03] <Cork> so to the browser the click event has ended
[21:40:15] <oojacoboo> yea, I see
[21:40:20] <Cork> so the popup is started from a non-user interaction
[21:40:28] <Cork> no way around that
[21:40:46] <Cork> except opening the ajax url in a new tab to start with
[21:40:46] <oojacoboo> well, as long as it's in the .submit() it should be ok, right?
[21:40:59] <oojacoboo> as per that example on SO
[21:41:37] <Cork> oojacoboo: as long as it happens directly in the event loop (that means no timer, no ajax) then yes its fine
[21:41:49] <oojacoboo> yea
[21:43:03] <Cork> oh, and the event has to come from the user actually clicking submit or a link or pressing enter in a form or similar
[21:43:07] <Cork> it can't be faked
[21:43:44] <oojacoboo> right, yea, that makes sense
[21:44:11] <oojacoboo> just trying to get a print action on a form save
[21:44:13] <oojacoboo> PITA
[21:45:14] <crab> this jsviews stuff looks really nice.
[21:45:47] <crab> and the jquery-ui integration is very good news. too bad it's not ready yet.
[21:48:50] <qawsedrf> morficus: it does
[21:48:54] <oojacoboo> morficus: Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation. Note that synchronous requests may temporarily lock the browser, disabling any actions while the request is active.
[21:48:56] <qawsedrf> isnt this crazy http://i.imgur.com/tacV8.png ? :)
[21:49:08] <qawsedrf> this only happens when i visit a link from the webpage and then get back with the back button
[21:56:08] <qawsedrf> ohh, and only happens in chrome
[21:56:14] <qawsedrf> chrome has a lot of bugs i guess :/
[21:56:16] <qawsedrf> :P
[21:56:42] <qawsedrf> nvm .text() works atleast
[22:51:03] <oojacoboo> so, this is the most frustrating thing ever, but I am trying to disable a form on .submit() where I HAVE to run a synchronous $.ajax call.  The issue is that as soon as the submit event fires, nothing else in that function will fire before.  Is there anyway to get events to fire before a $.ajax on .submit() ?
[22:51:27] <oojacoboo> I can't disable on click before the .submit() either b/c then the submit event doesn't fire at all
[22:52:12] <Cork> oojacoboo: why does the ajax call have to be async?
[22:52:15] <Cork> sorry
[22:52:17] <Cork> *sync
[22:52:27] <oojacoboo> b/c I am trying to do that pop-up
[22:52:33] <oojacoboo> on success
[22:52:48] <Cork> but... the page will hang until the ajax responds...
[22:52:56] <Cork> you can't do anything
[22:53:09] <oojacoboo> so, nothing between the submit and the ajax response?
[22:53:14] <Cork> you should prob find another solution
[22:53:44] <Cork> oojacoboo: the submit event will wait for the ajax response and the layout/browser will wait for the event
[22:53:55] <oojacoboo> ugh
[22:54:10] <Cork> so from the submit event starts until the ajax response happen and the event finnish, the browser is litterly hanged
[22:54:26] <oojacoboo> yea, I know
[22:54:35] <Cork> thats why syncronus ajax is a really bad idea
[22:54:36] <oojacoboo> I just wanted to squeeze in an event to disable the form
[22:54:46] <Cork> why?
[22:54:52] <Cork> the user can't click anything anyway
[22:55:09] <oojacoboo> b/c we have some visual logic in place so the user knows a save is going on
[22:55:35] <Cork> you could posibly add another submit event earlies in the event loop
[22:55:41] <Cork> not sure if that will work though
[22:55:50] <oojacoboo> I can on click
[22:55:53] <oojacoboo> for the button
[22:56:09] <oojacoboo> but I'd have to replicate all the logic in there b/c it's based on the form being disabled
[22:56:14] <Cork> oojacoboo: but the correct solution would be to dislay a link or similar to open the new window when the ajax is done
[22:56:26] <oojacoboo> yea, so I force the user to click again
[22:56:29] <oojacoboo> annoying
[22:56:35] <Cork> hanging the entire browser (and that means all tabs and windows( is REALLY!!! bad
[22:56:46] <oojacoboo> yea, I agree there
[22:56:55] <Cork> so, really... don't do it
[22:56:59] <oojacoboo> so is this limitation for opening another window :/
[22:57:07] <Cork> no, its not
[22:57:22] <Cork> its a terrible workaround for popupblockers
[22:57:27] <oojacoboo> only reason it's there is b/c people abused pop ups
[22:57:30] <Cork> accept it and do a reasonable solution
[22:57:55] <Cork> i would be extreamly pissed if i ever ended up on a page like that
[22:58:04] <oojacoboo> no you wouldn't
[22:58:08] <Cork> and that would be at the site/buiseness owning the site
[22:58:09] <oojacoboo> you don't even know what it does
[22:58:11] <Cork> yes i would
[22:58:14] <oojacoboo> lol
[22:58:14] <Cork> yes i would
[22:58:25] <oojacoboo> the user clicks… SAVE AND PRINT
[22:58:35] <oojacoboo> we save the form then open a window for print...
[22:58:38] <oojacoboo> how's that a bad UX?
[22:58:40] <Cork> unless the network is slow for some reason
[22:58:44] <Cork> and that happens alot
[22:58:51] <Cork> oojacoboo: you hang the browser
[22:59:00] <oojacoboo> I'm talking about aside from that
[22:59:15] <oojacoboo> I thought you were referring to the popup
[22:59:17] <Cork> its bad ux, so block the user from doing anything if something fails
[22:59:21] <qawsedrf> i want to removeClass(regex) is that possible ?
[22:59:27] <Cork> so==to
[22:59:32] <oojacoboo> Cork: I hear ya on that
[22:59:38] <oojacoboo> I agree, it's terrible
[22:59:41] <qawsedrf> removeClass('class_[any_num');
[22:59:44] <qawsedrf> removeClass('class_[any_num]');
[22:59:44] <Cork> so really... don't do that idiotic idea
[23:00:03] <oojacoboo> well, having to make someone go through a click click click game is also a bad idea
[23:00:05] <Cork> qawsedrf: o
[23:00:08] <Cork> *no
[23:00:11] <oojacoboo> so it's the lesser of all evils
[23:00:22] <qawsedrf> :(
[23:00:26] <Cork> qawsedrf: add all the classes you want to remove with a space separation
[23:01:02] <Cork> oojacoboo: the other alternative is to do the action in the new window, and do it all as a normal post
[23:01:15] <Cork> oojacoboo: syncronus ajax is pure evil
[23:01:26] <Cork> especially when theres options
[23:01:30] <oojacoboo> new window isn't an option here :/
[23:01:35] <Cork> and won't hang the user if the network fails
[23:02:04] <oojacoboo> would it be possible to setup a live event around a condition?
[23:02:08] <Cork> oojacoboo: you seriusly find it ok to hang the user for up to a few mins if there network gliches??
[23:02:17] <oojacoboo> Cork: I agree with you, terrible idea
[23:02:20] <Cork> i mean completly hang?
[23:02:31] <Cork> and you still find it "the best solution"???
[23:02:35] <oojacoboo> I'm not arguing for that method
[23:02:37] <oojacoboo> no
[23:02:39] <oojacoboo> I don't
[23:02:45] <oojacoboo> I find all of them not suitable
[23:02:55] <Cork> and you still pick the worst one??
[23:03:01] <oojacoboo> I haven't picked one ;)
[23:03:16] * Cork shivers a bit...
[23:03:20] <oojacoboo> ha
[23:03:29] <oojacoboo> can you setup a live event around a conditional statement?
[23:03:52] <Cork> conditional statement?
[23:03:57] <Cork> you mean an if statement?
[23:04:05] <oojacoboo> if($this == that)
[23:04:14] <Cork> sure
[23:04:27] <Cork> live and bind and all of them just calls a function
[23:04:43] <Cork> everything you can put in a function can be used in there
[23:04:45] <oojacoboo> so, I could change the value of a var in the success of an ajax call and then execute my open based on that?
[23:05:31] <Cork> except you don't know when it will be set so the submit event might finish first
[23:06:00] <Cork> only way to get around that would be to hald the submit event if it isn't set, and tell the user to submit again
[23:06:08] <Cork> or a separat button for "validation"
[23:06:17] <oojacoboo> mmm
[23:06:30] <oojacoboo> so, a live event then isn't really good?
[23:06:47] <Cork> live is no different from any other from of event
[23:07:00] <Cork> the only difference is what element it puts the listner on
[23:07:01] <jeffmoss> is it possible to override clone() for an individual element object?
[23:07:21] <Cork> jeffmoss: overide?
[23:07:31] <jeffmoss> I don't really understand the jquery internals, not sure if override even makes any sense
[23:08:08] <Cork> .clone basically run elm.coneNode
[23:08:18] <jeffmoss> I want to make my draggable drop into a sortable with connectToSortable, I've been studying the code and it clone()'s the element you're dragging
[23:08:18] <Cork> *cloneNode
[23:08:43] <Cork> jeffmoss: you can overide what draggable uses
[23:08:51] <Cork> you don't need to touch clone()
[23:09:04] <jeffmoss> I'm looking for a simple way to build a custom object into the sortable
[23:09:35] <Cork> ?g jquery ui draggable @ jeffmoss
[23:09:36] <bot-t> jeffmoss, jQuery UI - Draggable Demos & Documentation - http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[23:09:43] <Cork> look at options "helper"
[23:10:00] <jeffmoss> I have a custom helper, actually I want it to use the helper
[23:10:19] <jeffmoss> but it's hard coded: this.instance.currentItem = $(self).clone().removeAttr('id').appendTo(this.instance.element).data("sortable-item", true);
[23:10:29] <Cork> helper can generate what ever construction it wants
[23:10:55] <Cork> thats if you run 'clone'
[23:10:56] <jeffmoss> the problem is it only supports clone, discards my helper
[23:11:07] <Cork> if you give it a function it will take what it gets from it as a helper
[23:19:24] <poppiez> I'm trying to use a global image object to make sure a given image has loaded and then return its dimensions. it seems like whenever I load a second image, it has the same dimensions as the first. can anyone confirm this and how to avoid it? here's my code: http://pastie.org/private/n6x9kejcf5etc8b8qysptw
[23:20:14] <Zogot> morning all
[23:24:43] <sasori> is it possible to redirect to a different page via jquery, only stating the page name ( not including the domain name?) ..like e.g am in test1.php page, I clicked view link, then I'll get redirected to test2.php  ?
[23:25:30] <Zogot> normally what I do for those kind of things is specify a global car that holds the root url
[23:25:38] <Zogot> var
[23:26:32] <Zogot> I've been meaning to see if you could retrieved e
[23:26:42] <Zogot> it from the meta see url tag
[23:26:55] <Zogot> base
[23:27:03] <Zogot> sorry on mobile lol
[23:30:44] <sasori> i didn't get what you meant by the meta stuff
[23:33:46] <Zogot> there's a meta tag that goes in the head to specify the base url. but normally I key hardcode the root url var and just type rooturl + 'page2.php'
[23:34:04] <Cork> sasori: window.location = './page2.php' should work i think
[23:34:18] <qwerty> Hello
[23:34:24] <sasori> ok...lemme try that
[23:34:50] <Guest76149> I'm using jquery $ajax function.when i select a value from

[23:36:18] <oojacoboo> I don't see shit
[23:36:26] <donCams> guest, pastebin
[23:37:25] <poppiez> I'm trying to use a global image object to make sure a given image has loaded and then return its dimensions. it seems like whenever I load a second image, it has the same dimensions as the first. can anyone confirm this and how to avoid it? here's my code: http://pastie.org/private/n6x9kejcf5etc8b8qysptw
[23:38:42] <Guest76149> see this link http://pastebin.com/NsC9JFMg how to retriev value from url
[23:38:49] <sasori> Cork itwork :D
[23:38:51] <sasori> tnx
[23:38:58] <Cork> np
[23:39:31] <Cork> poppiez: why are you createing a complet dom image tree instead of just creating a new image object?
[23:39:53] <poppiez> Cork: I'm not sure I follow. you mean I should just do new Image();?
[23:40:00] <Cork> yes
[23:40:45] <Cork> Image is a lot more light waight then createElement('img')
[23:40:52] <Cork> *weight
[23:41:09] <Cork> and then you don't need to reuse it
[23:41:23] <Cork> just create a new one and replace the old object
[23:41:53] <Zogot_> There we go, no longer on mobile :p
[23:42:00] <poppiez> Cork: this might be a stupid question but should I do var loader = $(new Image());?
[23:42:37] <Cork> poppiez: no, just var loader = new Image(); loader.src = 'url';
[23:42:46] <Cork> (don't forget to bind onload)
[23:42:52] <Spadeski> Hello everyone
[23:42:58] <Zogot_> ahoy
[23:42:58] <Guest76149> Cork see this link http://pastebin.com/NsC9JFMg how to retriev value from url
[23:43:18] <Zogot_> dont need the equals
[23:43:32] <Zogot_> oh sorry, misread
[23:43:50] <Cork> Guest76149: you don't need to concut the data field, just do data: { u: u }
[23:44:00] <Zogot_> yeh surely shouldnt data be data: {u : u}
[23:44:13] <Guest76149> Cork:  got it working
[23:44:18] <Cork> Guest76149: and its sent as a normar parameter to the server
[23:44:19] <poppiez> Cork: thx a lot! :)
[23:44:25] <Spadeski> hmm Is there a way to get the url the on what page the link was clicked to lead it to a page
[23:44:28] <Cork> *normal
[23:44:41] <Spadeski> Refereral Url*
[23:44:43] <Cork> Spadeski: only server side
[23:45:14] <Cork> and thats if the user doesn't block it
[23:50:16] <poppiez> Cork: I have to use stuff like .each, .attr, .one etc. on the image. would it be less light-weight to use $(new Image())
[23:51:11] <Cork> poppiez: you can't use $() on Image as its not a dom element
[23:51:21] <Cork> poppiez: but there is no need to
[23:52:15] <poppiez> Cork: just tried out $(new Image()) and it seems to work fine
[23:52:50] <poppiez> but it probably creates a DOM element, right?
[23:52:56] <Spadeski> Hey Cork can I hit you up with an idea ? Let's say we have a text box at the bottom of the page floating for the suer to enter jquery and its like hackthissite.org
[23:53:41] <Cork> poppiez: no i'm not sure what it does with it, its basically the same as soing something like $(Math) or something
[23:53:48] <Cork> it will prob crash
[23:54:07] <poppiez> Cork: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/image-loading/
[23:54:14] <Cork> and if it doesn't then, ya it will be the same as '<img/>'
[23:54:56] <poppiez> Cork: but what other options do I have when I have to use .each, .one etc.?
[23:55:21] <Cork> i don't see why you have to
[23:55:39] <Cork> $.each(array_of_urls, function() {}); should fix the each
[23:56:00] <poppiez> Cork: how would you do this otherwise? http://pastie.org/private/brwhgmplppyx01ehmnevzw
[23:56:05] <Cork> var img = new Image(); img.onload = function() {}; should fix the one
[23:57:17] <Cork> poppiez: just bind the normal load event
