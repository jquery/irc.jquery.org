[01:15:45] <sgfgdf> hello, guys! i'm using backbone and i want to modifu every ajax url. i'm using $.ajaxPrefilter, but it appears not to work with models. am i doing something wrong?
[01:48:15] <madk|chrome> so, I have a <li> selected. Inside there is a <p> tag and then a <label>. I want the text of the <p> tag
[01:48:18] <madk|chrome> how do I get it?
[01:48:48] <Cork> madk|chrome: is the label inside the p?
[01:48:51] <madk|chrome> no
[01:49:09] <Cork> $(this).children('p').text()
[01:49:16] <madk|chrome> hmmm
[01:49:17] <madk|chrome> thanks!
[02:34:17] <dimi1947> I am trying to use the open mehod of jquery UI dialog to darkened the background....so the question is how to do that...how I will darken the background on dialog open
[02:34:46] <Cork> dimi1947: set the dialog to be a modal
[02:35:13] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-modal
[02:36:18] <dimi1947> I did that....
[02:36:38] <dimi1947> that just sets the background non-interactive
[02:37:27] <dimi1947> it does not darken the background cork
[02:39:16] <toomus> Hi all
[02:39:17] <Cork> dimi1947: it should put the dialog overlay on the page
[02:39:26] <Cork> how that overlay is styled is up to you
[02:41:57] <Cork> dimi1947: http://jsfiddle.net/js0vgdhr/
[02:43:57] <dimi1947> i cannot understand why in my case the background is not darkened
[02:44:20] <Cork> dimi1947: first of make sure the ui-dialog-overlay element is added to the page
[02:44:39] <Cork> if it is, then make sure it is styled so it covers the page and gets the correct background
[02:44:46] <dimi1947> what element is this....
[02:44:55] <Cork> uh, i just told you
[02:44:59] <dimi1947> just a moment....
[02:46:33] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/Le7skfx7/ here is my html
[02:47:37] <Cork> well you would have to reproduce the dialog (and the problem with it) for a fiddle to have any meaning
[02:47:54] <Cork> the ui-dialog-overlay is injected when a dialog is shown with the modal state
[02:48:11] <Cork> it isn't something you add manually
[02:48:29] <dimi1947> yes...I just saw that is bein added....
[02:48:48] <dimi1947> it does not seem to have any effect though
[02:49:41] <Cork> ya, cause something in your page is breaking the styling (or you don't include the jquery ui css for the dialog)
[02:50:10] <Cork> so again, inspect the element and make sure it has the styling it should have (use the fiddle i made as a reference)
[02:50:33] <dimi1947> ok...give me a minute to prepare the fiddle
[02:51:14] <Kartagis> Cork: would you be interested to know what I found about that Unexpected token < issue and how I solved it?
[02:51:24] <Cork> no
[02:51:29] <Cork> it is a common problem
[02:51:53] <Kartagis> it wasn't something like that for me
[02:53:03] <dimi1947> in the fiddle it works OK..but not locally https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/Le7skfx7/
[02:53:28] <Xatenev> dimi1947: so you didnt reproduce ur problem the right way :p
[02:53:36] <Xatenev> or forgot something of what u think is not important
[02:53:47] <Cork> dimi1947: start by looking at your page
[02:53:51] <Cork> display the dialog
[02:53:58] <Cork> and inspect the ui-dialog-overlay element
[02:54:02] <Cork> then check in the developer tools
[02:54:18] <Cork> make sure it has what it should have, if it does, then check what overrides it
[02:54:25] <Cork> if it doesn't then check why that is
[02:54:37] <Cork> it really is as simple as that, no need to make a fiddle
[02:55:16] <dimi1947> I found some css rules in the fiddle that do not exist in the local css file
[02:58:48] <anant> How can I use crossbrowser onbeforeupload?
[03:02:06] <Cork> anant: what do you mean?
[03:02:19] <Cork> it exists in all browsers today (as opera is gone)
[03:02:40] <Cork> though that said, browsers are thinking about removing it completely
[03:23:22] <toomus> I want to place div in top of input field. How to calculate this?
[03:24:50] <toomus> Bottom border of div should stick to top border of input
[03:33:37] <anant> @Cork I want to open lightbox popup when user closes the browser  but without alert box wich says "leave the page" or "Stay on the page".
[03:33:55] <anant> And need it crossbrowser
[03:34:00] <anant> How to achieve it?
[03:43:46] <Cork> anant: you can't
[03:43:53] <Cork> javascript can't prevent a user from closing a tab
[03:44:10] <Cork> only the confirmation dialog built in the browser is an option (today)
[03:45:28] <mooncup> 12:33 < anant> @Cork I want to open lightbox popup when user closes the browser but without alert box wich says "leave the page" or "Stay on the page".
[03:45:31] <mooncup> are you satan?
[03:46:10] <Uhkis> lol
[03:52:04] <anant> <mooncup>  I dont understand you
[03:52:50] <anant> @Cork I have seen scripts which does this and need to know how they do it
[03:54:57] <mooncup> anant: can you link an example?
[03:55:08] <mooncup> even if you do find a way to do it your users will hate you
[04:02:07] <Uhkis> true, not many actually useful cases
[04:04:07] <anant> How they do it http://www.popupdomination.com/?hop=richdpage
[04:05:21] <Uhkis> they dont.
[04:06:54] <Cork> anant: if you found a way (some actuall has in semi older firefox) you should file bug towards the browser
[04:07:06] <Cork> cause they are suppose to prevent that from happening
[04:07:27] <Cork> (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908289)
[04:07:51] <Cork> (fixed in ff29+)
[04:17:29] <arc_> the only use case for this is games
[04:17:52] <arc_> but as a user i would prefer if you just let me close the winow
[04:17:54] <arc_> window*
[04:18:28] <Cork> a game could just save the state instead
[04:18:43] <Cork> so no, there really isn't a use case for it anymore
[04:19:10] <arc_> well i meant like, if they wanted to have a dialog asking if he's sure he wants to close the window, but one that's styled like the game instead of the browser default
[04:20:11] <Cork> why would a game need that anymore then a webpage?
[04:20:23] <arc_> just stylistic purposes
[04:20:27] <arc_> especially for fullscreen games
[04:20:38] <Cork> website designers usually argue the same reason
[04:20:55] <arc_> i did say i would still prefer to be able to just close the window :p
[04:21:08] <Cork> that wasn't the part i talked about
[04:21:23] <arc_> then idk what you're talking about
[04:21:34] <Cork> it is that the styling need should be more needing for a game then a website
[04:21:59] <arc_> websites generally aren't trying to be immersive
[04:22:09] <Cork> heh says who :)
[04:22:35] <arc_> trying to keep people on the site isn't the same as being immersive
[04:22:54] <taplar> having a clashing element that doesn't match your layout/scheme is
[04:23:34] <taplar> can make it look cheap
[04:23:41] <taplar> branding  issue
[04:32:29] <anant> My intention is to show a lightbox ad when user close the browser
[04:39:07] <Cork> anant: well like i said, you can forget it, it isn't possible
[04:39:20] <Uhkis> just code a quick virus to do it
[04:39:44] <Cork> why not just a rootkit :)
[04:39:58] <Cork> display an ad in a system dialog everytime a tab is closed :D
[04:40:21] <Cork> cross browser (and applications)
[04:40:46] <Uhkis> close terminator tab > ONLINE CASINO! JOIN NOW!
[04:40:52] <taplar> ugh
[04:40:52] <Cork> XD
[04:43:21] <arc_> i wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt but i guess there was no point
[04:47:17] <Cheaterman> Hello buddies, I'm sorry to annoy you, but my .find('input[name="something"]') doesn't seem to work
[04:47:28] <Cheaterman> me can paste code
[04:47:42] <SirLagz> Cheaterman: sure
[04:48:00] <Cheaterman> https://bpaste.net/show/7a30b8dd9c98
[04:48:07] <Cheaterman> L33
[04:48:17] <Cheaterman> L34 alert is always 0
[04:48:22] <Cheaterman> (and definitely shouldn't be)
[04:48:27] <Cheaterman> also removing [name=] stuff does put 2
[04:48:41] <Cheaterman> so it seems like selecting input works, but the [name] thingy doesn't?
[04:49:16] <taplar> you know you could always keep a variable of what you appended, and use that, instead of trying to find it later.
[04:49:38] <SirLagz> Cheaterman: what taplar said...
[04:49:50] <Cheaterman> I didn't realize, buddy ;s
[04:49:51] <Cheaterman> I'm sorry
[04:49:58] <taplar> i also don't see entry_values
[04:50:00] <SirLagz> Cheaterman: no problems. Try that and let us know how you go
[04:50:00] <taplar> i see entry_names
[04:50:03] <Cheaterman> taplar: it's at the bottom
[04:50:06] <Cheaterman> in a separate func
[04:50:06] <Cork> Cheaterman: you add the second input after you select
[04:50:09] <Cheaterman> I need it twice
[04:50:11] <Cheaterman> Cork: yes
[04:50:12] <Cork> so it doesn't exist then
[04:50:18] <Cheaterman> but the event handler happens after everything is created
[04:50:19] <Cork> and that is why you don't find it
[04:50:38] <Cheaterman> like key_up and click etc are done after everything is created?
[04:50:46] <taplar> what Cork said
[04:51:12] <SirLagz> the experts are here, I don't need to do anything now lol
[04:51:18] <Cheaterman> But at the time when my event handler is fired, the input does exist though? :s
[04:51:23] <Cheaterman> That's what I don't understand
[04:51:32] <Cork> Cheaterman: make a jsfiddle
[04:51:33] <taplar> your creating a new input each time
[04:51:37] <Cork> include the related html
[04:51:41] <taplar> line 13
[04:51:57] <taplar> well, parent to the input
[04:52:00] <Cheaterman> Yes taplar
[04:52:11] <taplar> right, so it's empty, until you put stuff in it
[04:52:15] <Cheaterman> That's the whole point of this code actually :-) it's a "add new entry" button, and an entry has 3 inputs
[04:52:19] <Cheaterman> (+ the delete button)
[04:52:25] <Cheaterman> well 2 inputs and 1 select
[04:52:27] <Cork> Cheaterman: so... the event wont't ever work
[04:52:31] <taplar> and until you put stuff in it, you can't find that stuff
[04:52:53] <Cheaterman> I don't get it
[04:52:56] <`ULT> hi, how can I test this? Make sure jQuery v1.7+ (or Zepto [polyfill, event, data]) is loaded before the icheck.js.
[04:53:04] <Cheaterman> isn't .on() thingy fired AFTER everything is added
[04:53:16] <Cheaterman> like when I click, it's AFTER everything is added
[04:53:20] <`ULT> look in the Head if jquery is before the icheck.js file?
[04:53:21] <Cork> ah now i see the REAL problem
[04:53:29] <Cork> Cheaterman: your suing global names
[04:53:38] <Cheaterman> Cork: ah that's very possible yes
[04:53:42] <Cheaterman> and probably very bad :s
[04:53:46] <Cork> so you have one entry for the entire page
[04:53:52] <Cork> yes it is
[04:53:55] <Cheaterman> wat
[04:54:02] <Cheaterman> but then how did it work until now
[04:54:06] <Cork> it didn't
[04:54:08] <Cheaterman> like the delete button worked
[04:54:16] <Cork> it could only work on the last added row
[04:54:17] <Cheaterman> etc
[04:54:29] <Cork> also note you don't need to use entry at all
[04:54:52] <Cheaterman> !!!
[04:55:04] <Cork> you could use $(this).siblings('input[name="entry_values"]') instead
[04:55:07] <Cheaterman> (sorry for being such a noob, but good learning resources for jQuery don't appear to exist :s)
[04:55:17] <Cheaterman> Wow
[04:55:24] <Cheaterman> Sounds awesome thanks a lot Cork
[04:55:28] <Cheaterman> that's indeed what I need \o/
[04:55:43] <Cork> but ya, always, ALWAYS, define your variables with "var"
[04:55:52] <Cheaterman> Ah
[04:55:55] <Cheaterman> without var it's a global?
[04:55:57] <Cork> yes
[04:55:59] <Cheaterman> man JS is such a weird language
[04:56:03] <Cork> unless you use strict mode
[04:56:04] <taplar> :)
[04:56:04] <Cheaterman> >__> thanks a lot for the info
[04:56:05] <Cheaterman> Okay
[04:56:13] <Cheaterman> I never realized this simple thing :-(
[04:56:16] <Cork> "use strict"; is your friend :)
[04:56:18] <Cheaterman> Cork: How can I be in strict mode?
[04:56:18] <Cheaterman> yes
[04:56:22] <Cheaterman> it's like a namespace?
[04:56:24] <Cork> set that at the top of the file
[04:56:26] <Cheaterman> use strict; ?
[04:56:35] <Cork> explicitly "use strict";
[04:56:39] <Cork> in quotes
[04:56:41] <Cheaterman> O__O
[04:56:47] <Cheaterman> JS is REALLY weird
[04:56:57] <Cheaterman> But I'll certainly add that to my source, thanks
[04:57:01] <Cork> its in quotes to not throw errors in browsers that doesn't support it
[04:57:07] <Cheaterman> Oh, i see
[04:57:23] <Cheaterman> .. still kind of a weird way to work around browser compat
[04:57:24] <Cork> and be prepared for lots of errors when you do
[04:57:29] <Cheaterman> Ah?
[04:57:40] <Cork> cause ex function() { a = 1; } is parsing error in strict mode
[04:57:55] <Cork> function() { var a = 1; } is fine though
[04:58:07] <SirLagz> Cork: that's good to know. learn something new every day heh
[04:58:07] <Cheaterman> Ah but then I may not want that
[04:58:23] <taplar> you do.  it forces you to think about scope
[04:58:23] <Cork> you do actually
[04:58:35] <Cork> un defined variables is the number one source of bugs in js
[04:58:37] <Cheaterman> I was more like looking for a mechanism that removes var from the universe
[04:58:52] <Cork> lol that is the universe your in
[04:58:58] <Cheaterman> Nah, I actually use Python
[04:58:59] <Xatenev> :D
[04:59:00] <Cheaterman> :P
[04:59:00] <Cork> you just don't have any scopes if you do
[04:59:09] <Cork> everything is global
[04:59:15] <taplar> and without scope, nothing gets cleaned up
[04:59:16] <Cheaterman> Yeah, that's not good Cork
[04:59:23] <Cork> exactly
[04:59:24] <Cheaterman> I'm within a function so I expect my variable to be local to it
[04:59:28] <Cheaterman> BY DEFAULT
[04:59:31] <Cheaterman> not with some weirdo keyword :P
[04:59:43] <Cheaterman> And I expected "use strict"; to fix that
[04:59:45] <Cork> Cheaterman: well if you don't define that you want a variable how could it?
[05:00:03] <Cork> Cheaterman: actually var is on the way out :)
[05:00:11] <Cheaterman> Cork: "oh, a variable is assigned, it used to not exist, let's create it and make it local to the current scope"
[05:00:12] <Cork> it is (i hope soon) getting replaced by let
[05:00:17] <Cheaterman> very normal dynamic typing workflow imo?
[05:00:20] <Cheaterman> all interpreters do that IIRC
[05:00:26] <Cork> Cheaterman: you have variable inheritance in js
[05:00:38] <Cork> var a = 1; function() { alert(a) }
[05:00:49] <Cheaterman> a being global, this is valid in any language
[05:00:52] <Cheaterman> (minus the syntax ofc)
[05:01:04] <Cork> fine
[05:01:09] <Cork> function() { var a = 1; return function() { alert(a) } }()()
[05:01:18] <Cork> ;P
[05:01:21] <Cheaterman> That too is fine
[05:01:27] <Cheaterman> surrounding scope is global to the current one
[05:01:42] <Cheaterman> You don't need JS for this, PHP can do it too I believe
[05:01:43] <Cork> js> print((function() { var a = 1; return function() { return a; } })()());
[05:01:47] <b-ot> Cork: 1
[05:02:11] <dimi1947> I cannot make jquery validate work combined with jquery UI dialog...http://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/Le7skfx7/
[05:02:24] <dimi1947> the console shows nothing
[05:02:27] <Cheaterman> Oh or maybe closures shouldn't inherit scope Cork ? They do in Python so all of this seems VERY normal to me
[05:02:41] <Cheaterman> (except the terrible var keyword ofc)
[05:02:50] <Cork> Cheaterman: in most languages you can't inherit scopes yes
[05:02:56] <Cheaterman> Okay
[05:02:57] <Cork> or at least in most older languages :)
[05:03:06] <Cheaterman> I'm sorry :/ all the languages I used work like that
[05:03:06] <Cork> most new explicitly do implement it
[05:03:13] <Cheaterman> C/Cpp/Python/etc
[05:03:22] <Cork> c/cpp doesn't work like that
[05:03:34] <taplar> i was going to say, i don't remember that in cpp
[05:03:40] <Cheaterman> Doesn't it though? A global variable can be used anywhere without issue
[05:03:40] <Cork> you don't have anything like scope in those languages
[05:03:46] <Cork> nope
[05:03:49] <Cork> you have file scope
[05:03:50] <Cheaterman> What? Scoping is unambiguous in C/Cpp
[05:03:53] <Cork> not inheritance
[05:04:07] <Cork> you can define a file global variable
[05:04:12] <taplar> i remember in cpp you could make global constants, or define stuff
[05:04:16] <Cheaterman> You can also make it extern Cork
[05:04:19] <Cork> you can't define a function inside another function and hence no interitance
[05:04:20] <Cheaterman> and then its context widens
[05:04:27] <Cork> Cheaterman: true
[05:04:36] <Cork> but the fact stands it isn't anything close to this
[05:04:40] <Cheaterman> Cork: Hmm, now THIS is a good point, but I'm 95% sure C89 or C99 allows it
[05:04:48] <Cork> nope
[05:05:29] <Cheaterman> You can't define a function inside another one in C99 either? Hmm, NVM then, it's not like I ever tried either, just so many things are tolerated in C99
[05:05:55] <Cheaterman> Anyways, thanks a lot for teaching me the siblings() thingy :-)
[05:06:02] <Cork> the only compiled languages i know of that support inline functions are go and rust
[05:06:15] <Cork> the rest are scripting languages
[05:06:59] <dimi1947> I fixed it...no reason to bother
[05:07:11] <taplar> you not considering java based languages compiled? :)
[05:07:11] <Cheaterman> Hmm yeah, although C++ (and inparticular Cxx14 or Cxx15 or whatever) most likely has a closure mechanism
[05:07:21] <Cheaterman> taplar: they definitely aren't, at least no more than a pyc is :P
[05:07:31] <Cork> taplar: its a byte machine so... inbetween
[05:07:36] <taplar> ;)
[05:07:56] <Cork> it you call java a compiled language so would actionscript be
[05:08:03] <Cork> >_>
[05:08:20] <Cork> <-- isn't a big fan of java
[05:08:33] <taplar> i like it fine, i love me some groovy
[05:08:47] <Cork> gory you mean :)
[05:08:55] <Cork> j/k
[05:09:11] <taplar> (shrug)
[05:09:55] <Cork> i've delt too much with performance hog java servers too be a fan of them
[05:10:07] <taplar> lol, i can understand that
[05:10:12] <Cork> gui java are really bad too
[05:10:40] <Cork> as long as you stay at the console java is actually ok
[05:10:54] <Cork> and for some reason it works ok on mobile (writen quite a bit there)
[05:11:29] <taplar> we deal mainly with jsp/gsps.  and once you go to tomcat as a server it's not that bad.  the ibm one, which shall not be named, is quite bad
[05:11:54] <Xatenev> Cork: why is gui java bad?
[05:11:58] <Xatenev> Cork: like, for what reason?
[05:12:19] <Cork> Xatenev: cause as soon as you can't do what you need inside the java machine
[05:12:38] <Cork> and need to call into the system, java makes a snail look like a speed boat
[05:12:48] <Xatenev> ^^
[05:13:26] <Cork> it is that compatibility layer that makes java portable that is the core of the problem
[05:13:59] <Cork> also that java gui apps looks like crap doesn't help
[05:14:37] <Xatenev> might i ask a CSS based question in here ? ._.
[05:14:46] <Xatenev> nobodies responding in #css sadly :p
[05:14:54] <taplar> you can try.  *glares*
[05:15:07] <Xatenev> is there any way to higher the font size for the whole page?
[05:15:18] <Xatenev> like, take the current font size and increase it by 20% for example
[05:15:22] <Cork> Xatenev: answered over there
[05:15:26] <Xatenev> i c
[05:16:44] <taplar> what was the answer
[05:17:45] <Cork> to add a separate print stylesheat
[05:20:31] <taplar> speaking of which were'd that dude go.
[05:20:41] <taplar> SirLagz: hey, just cause we started talking doesn't mean you get to stop!
[05:20:50] <taplar> experts....phss
[05:21:04] <SirLagz> taplar: haha
[05:22:00] <SirLagz> when people much more switched on than me are helping, I'd probably just make things confusing
[05:22:44] <taplar> they're not already confusing?
[05:22:55] <taplar> :)
[05:22:57] <SirLagz> more confusing then :P
[05:23:31] <Cork> heh.. wow http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2015/08/reject-hevc-advance-licensing-terms.html
[05:23:34] <Cork> "Wants 0.5% Of Every Content Owner/Distributor’s Gross Revenue For Higher Quality Video"
[05:23:59] <Cork> that's a nice small licensing fee
[05:25:18] <taplar> who uses hevc?
[05:25:22] <taplar> youtube?
[05:25:44] <taplar> can't say i'm up to date on the media stuff
[05:25:49] <Cork> you use h264/h265, doly, techicolor?
[05:25:55] <Cork> if yes then you are
[05:26:15] <Cork> "pool including GE, Technicolor, Dolby, Philips, and Mitsubishi Electric"
[05:26:28] <taplar> phsss, patent trolls
[05:26:55] <taplar> there was one a while back in regards to rfid.  was stupid
[05:27:07] <taplar> set back development for months
[05:27:19] <Cork> this has set back development for about 20 years
[05:27:29] <Cork> before it was the mpeg group
[05:27:40] <Cork> and now it's hevc
[05:29:25] <Cork> xkcd survey huh >_>
[05:31:25] <arc_> taplar youtube uses vp9
[05:31:32] <Cork> no they don't
[05:31:34] <arc_> they specifically do not use h264/hevc because of this
[05:31:42] <arc_> umm ... yes they do? o_O
[05:31:47] <Cork> they use vp9 on about 10% of the videos
[05:31:57] <Cork> the majority of the videos are still h264
[05:32:19] <arc_> like ... from before they switched?
[05:32:44] <Cork> it has change a bit, but basically ya
[05:33:04] <arc_> i was going to say, i must just be unlucky and everything i watch is vp9
[05:33:15] <arc_> youtube looks like shit now because of that
[05:33:18] <Cork> depends on the resolution you pick
[05:33:35] <Cork> i haven't used there website for ages
[05:33:51] <Cork> mpsyt and youtube-dl ftw :)
[05:35:02] <taplar> interesting
[05:35:37] <taplar> there for a bit they had an implementation of their html5 player that actually had a download option.  i got a bunch of their vids before i guess they decided that wasn't a good idea
[05:36:10] <Cork> taplar: they never did, you most likely used one of the browser extensions that extends youtube
[05:36:14] <Cork> (they are still around)
[05:36:50] <Cork> ex. /?src=search
[05:36:51] <Cork> opps
[05:36:56] <Cork> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-download
[05:37:03] <taplar> hmm, may have been, but i'm pretty sure it was on their player.  downloaded the files as webm instead of mp3 or flv
[05:37:19] <taplar> only showed after opting in for the html 5 version
[05:47:46] <viraxis> jquery newbie here, seeking some advice. can anyone explain why a PUT ajax call places the data to be sent in the url, instead of in the body as json?
[05:52:58] <Dr-007> i've embedded an iframe into my html so i can later put in a src="" via jquery. the iframe has no src="" when i embed it into my html. but it does go to a website
[05:53:25] <Dr-007> is it possible to embed an iframe without it going to any website? i just want it to sit there until i give in a src via jquery
[05:53:35] <viraxis> lemme try that
[05:53:40] <viraxis> just a sec
[05:54:12] <arc_> i don't know the answer to that but you could just load a blank html file ..
[05:54:59] <Dr-007> arc_ problem is that it takes pretty much cpu. the iframe is inside a modalbox
[05:55:18] <Dr-007> the modalbox is only sometimes called
[05:55:24] <Dr-007> before i created the iframe via jquery
[05:55:32] <taplar> Dr-007: make it go to about:blank or only add it to the page when your ready to show it
[05:56:13] <Dr-007> taplar, thanks
[05:56:50] <viraxis> tried it; even without src about:black it renders a blank page here...
[05:57:26] <viraxis> is your cache clean? or maybe your jquery action is executed accidentally
[05:57:50] <viraxis> blank*
[05:57:57] <Dr-007> viraxis; without src="" on a domain it simply loads that domain
[05:58:06] <Dr-007> in firefox
[05:58:46] <Dr-007> anywaym, this works for me
[05:58:54] <Cork> about:blank is explicitly meant for this
[05:58:57] <viraxis> right; I forgot that my dev domain is currently empty
[05:58:59] <Dr-007> perhabs ill put the iframe rendering back to jquery later on
[05:59:46] <viraxis> so, maybe you could help me with something as well; I'm building a rest-based web app, and get/put works fine
[06:00:20] <viraxis> correction: get/post works fine. When I try put, it puts all the data in the url instead of the body of the request
[06:00:34] <viraxis> is this normal behaviour, or am I doing something wrong?
[06:00:43] <Cork> viraxis: to start with put isn't a standard verb
[06:01:04] <taplar> i need to double check mine, but i'm pretty sure my site editor is using put to update files and it is not puting the content of the file in the url
[06:01:06] <Cork> PATCH is though
[06:01:19] <Cork> ya, put is part of restful
[06:01:26] <viraxis> but I am indeed updating
[06:01:27] <Cork> and it is an extension to the http standard
[06:01:44] <viraxis> so I have get for requests, post for new content, put for updates, delete for removal
[06:02:11] <taplar> post also for searches
[06:02:18] <Cork> ah, though of testing my current setup
[06:02:23] <Cork> but i use patch here >_>
[06:02:31] <ravigehlot> !uptime
[06:02:32] <Cork> (it is the modern replacement for put)
[06:02:55] <viraxis> so instead of put, I should try and give patch a spin then?
[06:03:02] <Cork> give me a min
[06:03:11] <Cork> i need to find a way to test this on an older site
[06:03:22] <Cork> i'm quite sure put isn't put in the url for me, but i need to check it
[06:03:32] <taplar> i gotta spin up my rhcloud site
[06:04:10] <viraxis> take your time. could it help if I posted a short snippet, as example of what's going on here?
[06:04:50] <taplar> yeah i'm using put and it is not going in the url
[06:05:09] <Cork> viraxis: hmm _method: "put" is used there
[06:05:13] <Cork> and it uses post for put
[06:06:47] <Cork> viraxis: put works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/bo6qhgkp/
[06:06:52] <viraxis> let's see
[06:07:15] <Cork> it gives 403 for obvious reasons, but it sends the data correctly
[06:09:13] <viraxis> http://pastebin.com/8Pr6RA6q
[06:09:35] <taplar> uh
[06:09:40] <taplar> dataType: 'json' ?
[06:09:59] <taplar> or is explicit like that valid
[06:10:26] <viraxis> if I work with json using a rest debugging tool it doesn't throw any errors or warnings
[06:10:32] <viraxis> so I suppose it is, yes
[06:10:57] <viraxis> what would be your proposed way to do it?
[06:11:10] <taplar> try just 'json' in the logic
[06:11:14] <Cork> taplar: dataType just sets the accept header in the request
[06:11:18] <Cork> so ya it isn't needed
[06:11:21] <taplar> ah
[06:11:26] <Cork> it just defaults to */* if you don't set it
[06:11:42] <viraxis> aha, I see
[06:12:00] <Cork> though that said dataType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8' isn't valid
[06:12:14] <viraxis> it should be just application/json then?
[06:12:19] <Cork> 'json
[06:12:24] <viraxis> alright
[06:12:25] <viraxis> thanks
[06:12:42] <viraxis> but what about the url problem; when I post something, everything is fine
[06:12:48] <Cork> though unless the server can responds with multiple types you don't need it
[06:12:55] <viraxis> aha
[06:13:00] <viraxis> didn't know that
[06:13:13] <viraxis> example put thingy: http://localhost:1337/api/customers/1111/%22%7Bcust_shipto:9999999991,cust_â€¦,cust_name:/%22removal%20testing%20FOOBAR/%22,cust_lat:0,cust_long:0%7D%22
[06:13:19] <viraxis> this can't be correct
[06:13:23] <taplar> nasty
[06:13:25] <viraxis> indeed
[06:13:32] <Cork> viraxis: from what i can tell you shouldn't get that
[06:13:48] <Cork> you could try type: 'put' but it should be case insensitive so...
[06:14:21] <viraxis> yeah, that doesn't help indeed
[06:14:37] <Cork> also cust_name: makes me think your trying to send json, am i right?
[06:14:46] <Dr-007> after modifying $('.somediv').width('11px'); via jquery i now want .somediv to use the width thats set inside the css file
[06:14:53] <viraxis> that is correct; my data field comprises a single json object
[06:15:06] <Cork> and you do that through JSON.stringify?
[06:15:14] <taplar> Dr-007: huh?  your wanting to undo your width set?
[06:15:44] <Dr-007> taplar, thats right
[06:15:44] <Cork> Dr-007: $('.somediv').css('width', '')
[06:16:00] <viraxis> I tried with both stringify, aswel as the same correct json string which is used by my testing tool (Paw)
[06:16:20] <Cork> viraxis: could you try and reproduce the problem in jsfiddle?
[06:16:28] <Cork> also what jquery version are you using?
[06:17:03] <viraxis> 2.1.4
[06:17:05] <viraxis> the latest
[06:17:11] <viraxis> and sure, let me try
[06:17:22] <Cork> might be the reason
[06:17:33] <Cork> haven't really used 2.x much in production yet
[06:17:49] <Dr-007> Cork, well that was easy :) i was doing stuff like height('inherit'), height('none'), height('default')
[06:18:13] <taplar> Dr-007: you could also do that with adding and removing a class
[06:18:20] <Cork> Dr-007: jquery can only modify what is set in the inline style
[06:18:31] <Cork> so to get back the original value you want to remove that
[06:18:42] <Cork> also you should REALLY do what taplar said
[06:18:56] <Dr-007> taplar, yeah i know. but it isn't real handy for what i'm trying to do
[06:18:56] <Cork> css doesn't belong in js
[06:19:15] <slax0r> but .css() :P
[06:19:21] <taplar> is 11px dynamic?
[06:19:35] <taplar> or are you always changing it to and from 11px?
[06:19:41] <Cork> also .width expects a number not a string
[06:19:46] <Cork> .width(11)
[06:20:23] <Dr-007> taplar, im creating a trigger via PHP to launch my modalbox in jquery. but sometimes a modalbox needs to be wider for some reason. so now you can just give in the width via PHP whenever needed.
[06:20:35] <Dr-007> (and Cork)
[06:20:36] <Dr-007> :)
[06:20:44] <taplar> so it's a variable new width?
[06:20:51] <Dr-007> jup
[06:21:01] <taplar> akey
[06:21:13] <Dr-007> the modalbox had per default a "modal-lg" for large modalboxes
[06:21:28] <Dr-007> but that wasn't large enough for this specific page
[06:21:37] <Cork> i soo love that i set csp on the sites :)
[06:21:46] <Cork> no style tags allowed :>
[06:22:01] <Dr-007> i love style tags
[06:22:03] <Cork> or inline js for that matter
[06:22:09] <Dr-007> when im too lazy to go to my css document
[06:22:10] <Dr-007> :P
[06:22:12] <taplar> how does that work with like draggables?
[06:22:16] <Cork> well or style attributes
[06:22:33] <Cork> there are native support for draggable :)
[06:22:49] <Cork> but ya i don't need full draggable these sites
[06:23:30] <Cork> funny enough i haven't hit anything i haven't been able to solve yet
[06:23:40] <Cork> it just forces you to think in different ways
[06:23:48] <taplar> what is this csp?
[06:23:54] <Cork> `mdn csp
[06:24:10] <Cork> ... stupid bot
[06:24:11] <viraxis> back; this should be what you guys needed right?
[06:24:13] <viraxis> https://jsfiddle.net/cotght81/
[06:24:23] <Cork> taplar: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP
[06:24:33] <viraxis> (if I did something wrong, I have never ever used JSFiddle before)
[06:25:16] <instance> hey, I'm to customize the navbar in jquery mobile and having some issues, i just want 4 basic text buttons, and then 2 icon texts on the right side of the navbar. Is there a guide for customizing the css?
[06:25:29] <instance> trying*
[06:26:57] <Cork> viraxis: https://jsfiddle.net/cotght81/1/
[06:26:59] <Cork> works fine here
[06:27:19] <Cork> had to change the url though (as it is cross origin so my browser blocked it)
[06:27:35] <Cork> that might actually be your problem
[06:28:03] <Cork> jquery will automatically convert everything to get if it is cross origin
[06:28:21] <Cork> (as cors is blocked unless the server explicitly allow it)
[06:28:49] <viraxis> that is correct, but both my server as the target platform have been configured not to require cors
[06:28:57] <viraxis> and cors is also disabled in my testing browser
[06:29:09] <viraxis> but let me give your solution a try
[06:29:11] <viraxis> just a sec
[06:29:12] <Cork> ya, but jquery assumes it is blocking
[06:29:22] <Cork> as it can't recover from it if it hits it
[06:29:33] <Cork> i think it is crossDomain: true as an option though
[06:29:35] * Cork checks
[06:29:56] <Cork> ah, nope that was the other way around
[06:30:45] <Cork> viraxis: it might actually be part of cors why you get the effect you're seeing
[06:31:00] <Cork> cause i don't know if the none standard put is allowed cross domain
[06:31:31] <viraxis> it seems quite plausible that non standard verbs would be blocked, yes...
[06:31:53] <viraxis> also: I tried with the JSON stringify in my put, but to no avail
[06:32:20] <Cork> ya, that would have surprised me A LOT if that helped
[06:32:27] <Cork> it makes the code more readable though
[06:32:37] <Cork> so that is the main reason to use it
[06:33:17] <viraxis> true, but I was planning on doing that in the wrapping function
[06:33:29] <viraxis> just trying to keep as much logic out of the ajax calls
[06:33:59] <Cork> i would say the ajax call function should expect a native js object/array
[06:33:59] <viraxis> as much logic as possible outside of*
[06:34:02] <Cork> and always encode it
[06:34:13] <Cork> it normally makes for the cleanest implementation
[06:34:27] <viraxis> writing that advice down right now
[06:36:32] <viraxis> I'll try the patch verb instead, and if that doesn't help I'll just use post
[06:36:49] <Cork> what do you use on the server end?
[06:36:55] <viraxis> node with express
[06:37:08] <Cork> hmm ya, never used that in cors
[06:39:09] <islalobo> Iâ€™m trying to update the value of a hidden field with js but it isnâ€™t responding the way I want, does this looke right? http://pastebin.com/g0Y9MVN3
[06:39:14] <viraxis> yeah, the cors thing is quite annoying, but it is part of the project setup, so yeah..
[06:39:43] <Cork> islalobo: values takes a string not a bool
[06:39:48] <viraxis> Cork: thanks for the help and advice anyway; I'll just give some alternate options a try
[06:39:52] <Cork> though that said
[06:40:06] <Cork> islalobo: $('#edit-confirmed').val('false')
[06:40:07] <islalobo> Cork: Oh, sorry, I updated it to this: document.getElementById("edit-confirmed").value = FALSE;
[06:40:20] <Cork> islalobo: that isn't even valid
[06:40:27] <Cork> islalobo: input fields use strings
[06:40:29] <Cork> nothing else
[06:40:33] <islalobo> Oh, thank you!
[06:41:05] <Cork> viraxis: good luck
[07:32:05] <`ULT> hi all
[07:32:14] <`ULT> I have a problem with the plugin ichecked
[07:32:25] <`ULT> can someone take a look?
[07:33:41] <Cork> `ULT: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:34:02] <`ULT> okido
[07:34:46] <`ULT> unfortunately I cant provide a working fiddle with the problem
[07:35:36] <`ULT> But I have tree checkboxes, all equal, the last two are working correct, but the first checkbox doesn`t work like expected
[07:35:48] <`ULT> you can see it live on: http://www.kaskeus.nl/tuinkeus/index.php?route=product/product&path=32&product_id=313
[07:36:03] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/8brrfy
[07:36:28] <Cork> all three looks like that for me
[07:36:46] <`ULT> can you take a look to the screenshot?
[07:36:58] <Cork> that was what i commented on
[07:37:48] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/8brs8e
[07:38:55] <`ULT> the boxed one is also a checkbox, but without the check and styling
[07:39:01] <Cork> `ULT: http://s4.postimg.org/jris9gmyz/icheckbox.png
[07:39:50] <`ULT> yes, you see the same as me. We need to see three same styled checkboxes
[07:40:10] <`ULT> the third is only the text Checkbox
[07:40:20] <Cork> UH
[07:40:41] <Cork> ah, i think i get what you're trying to say
[07:40:51] <Cork> you mean each group have three checkboxes?
[07:40:55] <`ULT> yeah sorry for bad englisch
[07:41:01] <`ULT> right.
[07:41:05] <Cork> so it should be 9 not 6?
[07:41:10] <Cork> hmm
[07:41:42] <`ULT> thats right Cork, what I have in the html is this: <input type="checkbox" checked><label>Checkbox 2</label>
[07:41:42] <`ULT>           <input type="checkbox" checked><label>Checkbox 2</label>
[07:41:42] <`ULT>           <input type="checkbox" checked><label>Checkbox 2</label>
[07:41:46] <`ULT> sorry for code posting
[07:42:09] <`ULT> when I delete two of them, I didnt see a correct styled checkbox
[07:42:09] <Cork> those checkboxes should have an id and a for="" in the label though
[07:42:22] <`ULT> I can try that.
[07:42:51] <Cork> it shouldn't change anything
[07:43:02] <Cork> except make the label actually effect the checkbox
[07:43:15] <Cork> i would have to dig into what the plugin does to help you though
[07:43:15] <`ULT> Yep, true. It is not solving the problem.
[07:43:25] <Cork> so ya, you prob have to create a fiddle
[07:44:15] <`ULT> I think it is comflicting with some other code.
[07:44:18] <smgs>  >> if ( ( m-l > 5500 )  && ( $this.val().length >= 5) );
[07:44:36] <smgs> how to set it right using bot, possible ??
[07:45:15] <Cork> the bot can't solve that you have loads of undefined variables
[07:45:36] <smgs> they are defined. i think the if condition with && is wrong..
[07:45:59] <Cork> no the if statement is "fine" but the context is missing so hard to tell what it is suppose to do
[07:46:03] <Voyage> Once I saw something: When you scroll page down, an element appears while sliding from left to right or some other animation. Its animation is related to the scrolling or page and it being visible. How is that achieved?
[07:46:25] <Cork> Voyage: scroll events
[07:46:36] <Cork> (only way currently)
[07:46:41] <Uhkis> only once? theyre everywhere
[07:46:46] <Cork> csswg are specing on a solution
[07:47:52] <Voyage> Cork,  hm so what is that scroll even? I think it would relate to a specific element's _visibility_  OR page x axis?
[07:48:08] <Cork> you missed the "ts" there :)
[07:48:15] <Cork> on('scroll', func)
[07:48:15] <Voyage> ts?
[07:48:20] <Cork> events not even
[07:48:25] <Voyage> oh
[07:49:07] <Voyage> so ('scroll', func) is just scrolling. but I want it to happen on a specific elements visibility (when the element emerges from bottom to top) while user is scrolling
[07:49:39] <Cork> well you have to bind the scroll event on the element that has the overflow
[07:49:54] <Cork> then you have to check the scrollTop value and move the element based on that value
[07:50:10] <Voyage> scroll top
[07:50:23] <Voyage> is there an example?
[07:50:27] <Voyage> that I can see?
[07:50:46] <Voyage> It would be easy if I just attached the scroll function to an element. Whenever it becomes visible. it shows up
[07:50:47] <Cork> i don't have an example laying around no
[07:51:01] <Voyage> hn
[07:51:02] <Voyage> ok
[07:51:03] <Cork> you should be able to be able to find loads of them if you google a bit
[07:51:17] <sonnie> hi there, i have two events using ajax, the code of each success function is exactly the same. How to re-write them with common code?
[07:51:32] <Cork> you could check for paralax it is a similar effect (uses the same technique but with different effect)
[07:51:55] <Cork> sonnie: make then a named function and use them in both places
[07:52:44] <sonnie> Cork, thanks for the answer. I haven't tried a named function in ajax...
[07:53:02] <Cork> function aName() {} $.ajax().done(aName)
[07:53:32] <Cork> or you could have the function take the url if that is all that differentiates them
[07:58:22] <`ULT> hi cork i found the problem. It is something realy weird.
[08:00:51] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/8bs2ev
[08:02:44] <Voyage> Cork,  what keword to use  ?
[08:02:56] <Cork> ?g jquery paralax example
[08:03:01] <Cork> for example
[08:03:05] <Voyage> oh so its paralax?
[08:03:14] <Cork> not exactly
[08:03:15] <Voyage> the scroll effect is called paralex?
[08:03:19] <Voyage> hm then?
[08:03:33] <Cork> but like i said it uses the same technique
[08:03:35] <decx> parallax just means layers that move at different speeds based on distance
[08:03:52] <Voyage> hm
[08:04:42] <decx> i didnt read back but what people started calling a pointless fixed image background for scrolling parallax too
[08:08:31] <islalobo> I'm trying to call submit function from jquery: http://pastebin.com/HLRSR8zH  I put some debugging code in the submit function and it isn't getting called when the confirm-clinic-info button is clicked
[08:10:12] <islalobo> The button is in a modal overlaying the actual form.
[08:14:45] <sonnie> Cork, is it possible to use a named function(with lots of jquery selectors) outside jquery for ajax's callback function?
[08:23:49] <Phoenixz> I'm using jquery validator with the remote: URL option, and I have a problem that I need to click the submit button twice.. Now I know this is due to the asynchronous way the ajax calls work, but I would have thought that this remote option would keep that in mind.. Is there any documented way to fix this without using async: false ?
[08:23:52] <Phoenixz> Because that's currently the only option I've found, and I think it kinda sucks
[08:59:12] <mazpe> let say i have a $('#dostuff').trigger('click'); how can i run another one... but only after #dostuff is completed?
[08:59:42] <taplar_> run another what?
[09:00:00] <mazpe> function
[09:00:05] <mazpe> like $("#myModal").modal('show');
[09:00:18] <taplar> put that at the end of your click handler
[09:02:46] <mazpe> taplar: this is what i have now...https://jsfiddle.net/zf7xspqk/ and the modal pop ups righ away... my imageUpdate promps for a file upload and process the image.
[09:08:00] <mazpe> taplar: this is what it actually looks like: https://jsfiddle.net/zf7xspqk/2/
[09:09:40] <Kartagis> mazpe: html as well
[09:11:42] <mazpe> Kartagis: ok.. let me updated.. Yeah, i just need the model('show') to run AFTER the imageUpdate is completed
[09:12:45] <Uhkis> so put it in fileuploaddone?
[09:14:21] <Phoenixz> Anybody who might know how to fix jquery validator issue where a remote check will cause me to have to click twice on submit buttons because the remote option is async? Is there an option to tell jquery validator to just wait for the async result from the remote URL and then either contiue submit, or cancel due to invalid data?
[09:14:29] <taplar> or maybe use a promise done, https://jsfiddle.net/zf7xspqk/4/
[09:17:38] <mazpe> taplar: i like it.
[09:17:38] <mazpe> thanks
[09:26:21] <Kartagis> can someone help me attach multiple events to document, calling the same code?
[09:30:17] <taplar> Kartagis: you can do on('event1, event2', callback)
[09:31:51] <Kartagis> taplar: so, document.addEventListener("deviceready, resume", function(){ ... }); is actually correct?
[09:32:19] <taplar> i dunno if that applies to addEventListener
[09:33:37] <taplar> you could pull your function out into a named function or variable and call that guy twice though
[09:33:48] <Kartagis> taplar: is document.on("deviceready, resume", function(){ ... });  correct?
[09:34:10] <taplar> $('body').on(...
[09:34:36] <taplar> though binding as low as possible is recommended
[09:35:33] <taplar> if body doesn't work try $(document)
[09:49:33] <sri_> hwll
[09:49:37] <sri_> Hello
[09:49:49] <taplar> welcome
[09:50:00] <sri_> i need doubt about jquery
[09:50:35] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:50:37] <Kartagis> so, $('body').on("
[09:50:42] <Kartagis> doubt?
[09:50:59] <taplar> probably just a language translation thing
[09:51:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:51:30] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: do multiple events work on event handling?
[09:51:36] <sri_> plz tell about floating  div in jquery
[09:51:43] <robertmaxrees> sri_ you use .css() for it.
[09:51:50] <sri_> ya
[09:51:57] <taplar> $(element).on('event1, event2', handler);
[09:52:58] <taplar> though i saw a 'click touchend' work earlier so the comma may not be required
[09:53:06] <robertmaxrees> no comma
[09:53:09] <robertmaxrees> just spaces.
[09:53:11] <Kartagis> taplar: but you said this was not preferable and you didn't know if it worked on addEventHandler
[09:53:26] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[09:53:49] <taplar> i also said you could extract the function to a variable or name it and reuse it for the addEventHandler
[09:53:55] <Kartagis> so, $('body').on("deviceready resume"), function() { ... });?
[09:53:57] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:54:13] <robertmaxrees>  $('body').on("deviceready resume", function() { ... });?
[09:54:31] <Kartagis> would that work?
[09:54:38] <robertmaxrees> are those legit events?
[09:54:49] <robertmaxrees> oh phonegap
[09:54:50] <Kartagis> for phonegap, aye
[09:55:05] <robertmaxrees> it's $(document)
[09:55:09] <robertmaxrees> not $('body')
[09:55:11] <robertmaxrees> http://docs.phonegap.com/en/4.0.0/cordova_events_events.md.html
[09:55:25] <taplar> cool, wasn't sure
[10:01:46] <Kartagis> thanks
[10:04:48] <Phoenixz> I'm using jquery validator with the remote: URL option, and I have a problem that I need to click the submit button twice.. Now I know this is due to the asynchronous way the ajax calls work, but I would have thought that this remote option would keep that in mind.. Is there any documented way to fix this without using async: false ?
[10:06:03] <robertmaxrees> that sounds wrong.
[10:08:36] <Scriptonaut> hey guys. I'm having a weird binding issue. I am binding on the submit of a form with id "#new_person". However, it's also binding on another form I have with a completely different id. Here is the javascript(coffee) that does the binding, as well as the form that is wrongly triggering the event: https://gist.github.com/robins35/bc77c7c687e8f6da575b
[10:09:00] <robertmaxrees>  $(document).on 'submit', $("#new_person"), (e) ->
[10:09:06] <Scriptonaut> ya
[10:09:07] <robertmaxrees> should  $(document).on 'submit', "#new_person", (e) ->
[10:09:14] <robertmaxrees> takes a string, not an object.
[10:09:17] <Scriptonaut> ahhhh
[10:09:22] <Scriptonaut> so I'm making a new object
[10:09:30] <Scriptonaut> when I do: $("#new_person")
[10:09:52] <robertmaxrees> you're making a new jquery object, yeah.
[10:10:06] <Scriptonaut> thanks :)
[10:10:14] <Scriptonaut> that was really quick
[10:15:36] <Voyage> Once I saw something: When you scroll page down, an element appears while sliding from left to right or some other animation. Its animation is related to the scrolling or page and it being visible. How is that achieved?
[10:15:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:16:50] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  like this http://cqtechnologies.com/portfolio.php
[10:17:14] <robertmaxrees> have you tried inspecting the page?
[10:18:37] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  cant trace it. yes
[10:18:43] <robertmaxrees> isotope, yo.
[10:18:47] <robertmaxrees> it says on the elements :)
[10:19:12] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  so the class name is isotope?
[10:19:22] <robertmaxrees> try searching google.
[10:19:24] <robertmaxrees> see what comes up :)
[10:19:29] <Voyage> isotope-item
[10:19:34] <robertmaxrees> (it's a library)
[10:19:38] <Voyage> hm
[10:24:01] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  cant find it. its not like http://cqtechnologies.com/portfolio.php
[10:24:16] <robertmaxrees> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/ this is the library they're using.
[10:24:40] <robertmaxrees> i'll guess they're using that with waypoints to accomplish it.
[10:25:55] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  but how does the scroll from left to right whan the page scroll reaches those elements ?
[10:25:59] <nitrospectide> I'm trying to make all of the TMs in my page headlines red, and found this on the web, but it's not working correctly: http://pastebin.com/BEXq9UdG
[10:26:08] <robertmaxrees> Voyage jquery waypoints is used for that.
[10:26:23] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  waypoints? is there a demo?
[10:26:30] <robertmaxrees> Voyage search google :)
[10:26:38] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide make a fiddle.
[10:27:04] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide also -  $(this).html() returns a string.  you're editing that returned string.
[10:27:37] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to pass the new string to $(this).html() - it'd basically be $(this).html($(this).html().replace(/(\â„¢ )/g, '<span style="color: red;">â„¢ </span>'));
[10:28:19] <robertmaxrees> also, $('h1#page-title').each(function () { doesn't make sense - you can't have more than one element with a given ID, so using .each() won't do anything.
[10:34:03] <jak2000> hi all
[10:34:34] <jak2000> when the page load fill a Html table, i add record with ajax, how to reload the page for add the new record?
[10:34:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:36:13] <Uhkis> just add the new row after its added to the backend?
[10:36:34] <robertmaxrees> or expose that data from your backend an rerender the table.
[10:36:37] <jak2000> step 1) load a page, 2) fill a HTML table, 3) the user click on add button, and add new record, him for see the new record press F5 (reload the page) how do it with jquery
[10:36:50] <robertmaxrees> why are you using ajax for that?
[10:36:55] <robertmaxrees> that's a normal form post.
[10:36:58] <robertmaxrees> no jquery needed.
[10:37:04] <jak2000> FOR ADD A NEW RECORD_
[10:37:14] <robertmaxrees> you don't need jquery for that if you're going to reload the page anyway.
[10:37:17] <jak2000> sorry for the caps
[10:37:48] <jak2000> yes i want do the reload with jquery
[10:37:48] <jak2000> or... how to add the new record?
[10:37:48] <jak2000> at html table?
[10:37:59] <robertmaxrees> you said you want to reload the entire page, right?
[10:39:09] <jak2000> yes
[10:39:09] <jak2000> or, how to add the new record?
[10:39:22] <robertmaxrees> you could use .append() and append that data to the table.
[10:39:29] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, there's no reason to use jquery at all.
[10:39:29] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[10:39:37] <robertmaxrees> just use a plain form post and reload the page.
[10:41:23] <QueenJeks> anyone familiar with pupload?? is there a config option for after the upload was successful?
[10:41:49] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: It had originally used a class, and I switched to an ID at the last minute, so yes, the each doesn't make sense now. I tried what you recommended, but it isn't working: https://jsfiddle.net/5r04o56n/
[10:42:09] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Uploader#fileuploaded QueenJeks
[10:42:43] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide open your console.
[10:42:45] <robertmaxrees> syntax error.
[10:44:00] <robertmaxrees> also, whitespace is significant in regex.
[10:44:21] <robertmaxrees> so it should be /(\â„¢)/g
[10:47:20] <QueenJeks> ok robertmaxrees but how did you get to this page?? because its not linked through their website you get https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Options
[10:47:50] <robertmaxrees> QueenJeks there's a table of contents on the repo.
[10:47:54] <robertmaxrees> that was under "events"
[10:49:07] <QueenJeks> ah ok i don't know the difference thats it. thanks!
[10:49:26] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: Gotcha. Thanks!
[11:08:53] <jeffmjack> whenever this ajax request fires, an error flashes for a split second to my console and the page reloads. Any ideas? http://pastebin.com/aJ2135CR
[11:09:27] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[11:10:50] <robertmaxrees> also, console.log(myobject); - i don't see that object defined anywehre.
[11:10:51] <jeffmjack> I don't know, it all happens too fast, and I don't know how to set the right kind of breakpoint for it
[11:12:03] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/2bb7e8d00f21
[11:12:06] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[11:12:48] <jeffmjack> cool, did you do anything besides comment out the console.log?
[11:12:55] <robertmaxrees> fixed all the syntax errors.
[11:13:05] <jeffmjack> oy ok
[11:13:07] <robertmaxrees> you had a lot of extra commas / missing semicolons.
[11:13:18] <robertmaxrees> skip those first three vars btw.
[11:16:13] <jeffmjack> I did :)
[11:16:18] <jeffmjack> yeah they were defined upstream
[11:16:48] <jeffmjack> so, that prevents the consoled error from disappearing :) "no access-control-allow-origin" set :)
[11:17:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:18:17] <jeffmjack> the error is thatXMLHttpRequest cannot load http://connectedkingdom.com/save. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
[11:18:28] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.
[11:18:30] <robertmaxrees> CORS issue.
[11:18:58] <jeffmjack> yeah
[11:18:59] <robertmaxrees> the port, protocol, and domain need to match, otherwise the remote server has to setup special rules.
[11:19:11] <jeffmjack> like in nginx?
[11:19:36] <jeffmjack> that makes sense, I'm serving the file locally for dev
[11:19:41] <robertmaxrees> sure, but that can potentially be dangerous if you don't to it right.
[11:55:08] <islalobo> can I pass an array of values using window.location?
[11:55:49] <islalobo> <button class="icrs-primary-button" onclick="window.location.href = 'user-register'; $somearray; return false;"><?php print t('Continue'); ?></button>
[11:56:01] <Sheraf> you can separate each value with a special character
[11:56:04] <Sheraf> and the split it back
[11:56:24] <Sheraf> window.location.hash
[11:58:50] <islalobo> Sheraf: wouldi it pass as query parameters in the url then? or as a post request?
[13:36:44] <paulong_> Hi someone here?
[13:36:51] <robertmaxrees> 677 people
[13:36:52] <robertmaxrees> :)_
[13:37:35] <paulong_> hahah oks you xD
[13:37:56] <paulong_> I have a question!
[13:38:08] <robertmaxrees> just ask.
[13:39:12] <paulong_> I'm doing a wepapp on jquerymobile is almost done! but I have a loging page and other data I have to handle
[13:39:26] <paulong_> but i not sure how can i do that! +
[13:39:42] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[13:41:37] <paulong_> for example  the login page! but get the data and create the user, when the user introduce the email adress and the password that data
[13:41:57] <robertmaxrees> that would involve server-side setup.
[13:43:48] <paulong_> like SQL server?
[13:44:02] <robertmaxrees> you'll need a web server, a server-side language, and a database.
[13:46:42] <paulong_> oks but I should do that first than the build de webapp?
[13:46:50] <robertmaxrees> sure
[13:48:13] <paulong_> is kind a hard for me I dont the correct knowledge!
[14:00:02] <paulong_> robertmaxrees; do have a guid about that you mention?
[14:10:51] <Voyage> going to ask a complex question: Is there a way to view a website without a browser?
[14:12:07] <based_p> what do you mean by "view"
[14:12:18] <Voyage> view == see == visit
[14:12:25] <Voyage> == load
[14:12:37] <Voyage> == access
[14:13:36] <based_p> there are command line tools like curl
[14:13:52] <Voyage> ya but view like in browser?
[14:14:01] <based_p> your question doesn't make sense
[14:14:05] <Voyage> hm
[14:14:07] <Voyage> Is there a way to view a website http://b.com inside http://a.com  but b.com should be viewed inside some container that is not html based. Maybe flash?
[14:14:32] <Voyage> some sort of container that does not shows the html of the website (but it does loads it and shows it)?
[14:14:59] <based_p> like an iframe?
[14:15:19] <Voyage> yes, kind of
[14:15:32] <Voyage> but I dont want any one to view the html
[14:15:42] <Voyage> just view and use/ click / scroll etc
[14:16:03] <ngharo> use a pdf then
[14:16:49] <Voyage> pdf is not browseable/ page redirects etc
[14:17:30] <ngharo> what is so proprietary about your markup that you cannot share it
[14:18:33] <based_p> reminds me of http://samy.pl/
[14:18:40] <based_p> i haven't looked into how he does this
[14:24:18] <bango2> based_p that's really neat, he even hides the source code when you try to view source
[14:26:17] <robertmaxrees> you can still get that guy's markup.
[14:26:53] <bango2> im sure you can, but i wouldnt know how to go about it
[14:27:06] <robertmaxrees> check out your dev tools.
[14:27:09] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:27:11] <bango2> alright
[14:27:19] <bango2> i already tried to ftp that was a fail lol
[14:27:25] <NitroLiq> Hey Robert. I'm still having trouble with what I was asking about yesterday. Any chance you can take a peek? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NqeJKb
[14:27:46] <robertmaxrees> i don't remember anything about your problem lol.
[14:28:04] <robertmaxrees> and i'm kind of elbow deep in some problems.
[14:28:15] <robertmaxrees> have any particular questions?
[14:28:17] <NitroLiq> Basically trying to toggle different menus based on which icon is clicked
[14:28:43] <NitroLiq> I've gotten one to fly in but my logic doesn't seem to get it to fly back out
[14:28:55] <robertmaxrees> check for all actives and close them.
[14:29:04] <NitroLiq> something flawed in my 'else' bit
[14:29:08] <robertmaxrees> $('.active').hide(); or whatever
[14:29:41] <bango2> lol the guy didnt even obfuscate his code
[14:29:55] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq if ($('li i').hasClass('fa-bars')) { huh?  there are multiples there.
[14:30:39] <NitroLiq> I can just use i
[14:30:50] <robertmaxrees> there are still multiples.
[14:30:53] <robertmaxrees> what is that code trying to do?
[14:33:36] <NitroLiq> yeah, I added alerts and see it's quite messed up
[14:34:37] <NitroLiq> Basic menu functionality, click one icon, one div flys in; click another, then it flys back out or whatever and the new one flies back in
[14:57:13] <jak2000> hi all

[18:51:52] <acidjazz> if inside a click handler
[18:59:46] <canine> acidjazz, did you see the pastebin ?
[19:00:01] <canine> I have a bunch of those div class "item"
[19:00:23] <canine> one of them has <a href="/agenda/minha-agenda"> inside it
[19:00:25] <canine> the rest do not
[19:00:30] <acidjazz> yea its just html and you havent specified how
[19:00:33] <canine> based on this specific href
[19:00:45] <canine> I want to be able to locate the entire div class item
[19:00:49] <canine> and delete it from my dom
[19:01:07] <acidjazz> so you mean a click handler on the href
[19:01:23] <acidjazz> like where does your code start
[19:01:28] <canine> no i mean after an ajax success code
[19:01:32] <canine> I want to deleter that entire div
[19:01:37] <canine> and locate it based on the href
[19:01:40] <canine> delete*
[19:02:12] <canine> something like
[19:02:28] <canine> $('a[href="/agenda/minha-agenda"]').parent('item').remove();
[19:03:04] <canine> does that make sense?
[19:03:22] <acidjazz> ye sure
[19:03:29] <acidjazz> why based on the href?
[19:03:34] <martin295> hey everyone
[19:03:39] <canine> because that is all i have without modifying the entire html
[19:03:44] <canine> all that is unique
[19:03:46] <acidjazz> why not just like mark your div you're looking for w/ something to select
[19:04:06] <canine> i am working on an already made html and i would prefer not to modify it
[19:04:08] <acidjazz> so your href is .content > h2 > a
[19:04:13] <snover> did jquery promises ever become a+ compatible?
[19:04:17] <acidjazz> what do you want to target then canine
[19:04:30] <canine> the <div class="item">
[19:04:34] <canine> and remove it
[19:04:36] <canine> detach it
[19:04:40] <acidjazz> ok
[19:04:41] <martin295> i'm having some trouble with ajax and php... more specifically, when i click submit on the contact form, and on success, i just want to show a message to the user that their message has been sent
[19:04:42] <acidjazz> so how far back are we
[19:04:48] <acidjazz> a, h2, div, .item
[19:04:53] <acidjazz> so .parent(3)
[19:05:02] <acidjazz> $('a...').parent(3).remove();
[19:05:11] <martin295> it keeps on redirecting to the site that does the php validation for the contact form, rather than just giving me back the ajax, if that makes sense
[19:05:22] <canine> actually there is 3 of those same href
[19:05:27] <canine> one is one level under
[19:05:40] <canine> inside class photo
[19:05:55] <acidjazz> $('a..').first() or something
[19:05:56] <canine> parent().remove would work?
[19:06:00] <canine> ill give it a shot
[19:06:02] <acidjazz> sure
[19:06:14] <acidjazz> start with just .parent(3) and console.log the div to make sure its right
[19:06:24] <acidjazz> martin295: so your form is submitting when you jsut want to run ajax
[19:07:03] <Ghost_Chilli> Alright, I got it working with, var hidden = $(this).parent().find('input:hidden').val();   However, it spits out a massive error in the console starting with "TypeError: value is null .... "
[19:07:29] <acidjazz> paste the whole error
[19:07:39] <martin295> acidjazz: well, i want another page to do the validation using the POST method, then if it's successful, display whatever the message is from that page
[19:08:07] <acidjazz> martin295: well the post is going to happen then, and the page is going to refresh
[19:08:15] <acidjazz> martin295: no JS is going to stop that unless you want to stop the post
[19:08:54] <martin295> acidjazz: ahhh, so how would i stop the post from happening?
[19:09:29] <acidjazz> martin295: that or post via ajax yourself, which woudl allow you to show the message and control the loading flow
[19:09:43] <acidjazz> martin295: collect hte data similar to the form and use $.post
[19:09:56] <Ghost_Chilli> acidjazz, here's an ss of the error, http://i.imgur.com/v77e0oT.png
[19:10:13] <acidjazz> Ghost_Chilli: thats some kinda something else
[19:10:23] <acidjazz> Ghost_Chilli: i dont see that being really jquery-selector-specific
[19:10:58] <Ghost_Chilli> Hmm, fair enough. I'll test in chrome console instead. Cheers.
[19:15:05] <snover> answer: nope.
[20:50:16] <alxibra> rails /join
[21:03:15] <Ghost_Chilli> Say you've got an event hander, $('.msg-read, .msg-del").on("click", function...  Is there a way within the function to see which event handler was the caller?
[21:12:27] <Ghost_Chilli> nm
[22:02:34] <DarkSector> I have a column = ["foobar.foobar"] and I have a json object like {"foobar": {"foobar": 10"}}. How do I programatically get value of the inner foobar
[22:02:53] <DarkSector> I can do json.foobar.foobar but I can't do json['foobar.foobar']
[22:26:07] <acidjazz> uhm
[22:26:12] <acidjazz> so the 1st is an array
[22:26:21] <acidjazz> arrays dont really have keys
[22:26:27] <acidjazz> their keys are 0-total
[22:26:34] <acidjazz> so itd be json[0] for foobar.foobar
[22:51:14] <arepie> Hello, im using .contents() to get xml from an iframe, however, i can't iterate through the object
[22:52:28] <arepie> for example: inside my iframe i have, <iframe><xml tag><root stat="ok">....</root></iframe>
[22:53:19] <arepie> var framecontent = $("#frameID").contents(); <-- since content already make the xml as a dom object, do i need to use xmlParser()?
