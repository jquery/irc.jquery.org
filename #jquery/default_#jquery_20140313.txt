[00:48:14] <Dahliz91> In the stop event on my sortable I am updating my column with row numbers. But the elements that has been moved doesn't update even do I can se the new value when i send the element to console after updating the value. Is sortable replacing the element with a new one when it moved the element?
[00:54:16] <leotr|2> hello. How do i access form data that was sent to server in success() callback of $.ajax?
[01:21:16] <jeremib> Is there a better way to get the jquery object when using .get()?  this is what I currently have: jQuery(jQuery('#sortable-auctions>tr').get(i))
[01:23:18] <xec> lol
[01:23:31] <xec> oh i see what you want
[01:23:39] <xec> ?ap eq  @ jeremib
[01:23:42] <xec> ?api eq  @ jeremib
[01:24:02] <xec> no bot i guess
[01:24:05] <xec> jeremib: https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[01:24:08] <jeremib> lol
[01:24:44] <jeremib> perfect, thanks xec
[01:28:25] <fabioportieri> o/
[01:35:05] <jeremib> ok, what about a quick way to get an array of data attribute values?
[01:35:32] <jeremib> jQuery('.active').data('myid')
[01:35:53] <jeremib> returns the first one obviously, but is the only way to build an array is run through with $.each ?
[01:36:46] <xec> $.map($(".active"), function() { return $(this).data("myid") }); might work
[01:36:57] <xec> if i remember the syntax right
[01:38:54] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/3y8m9/ why does sub menu repeat
[01:40:20] <jeremib> xec: seems jQuery(this) is returning the Window object
[01:41:02] <jeremib> but, this worked: $.map($(".active"), function(el) { return $(el).data("myid") });
[01:41:08] <jeremib> thanks again xec
[01:41:35] <xec> right, good :)
[01:50:14] <DRSK> Hello. So, the classic :hover issue for devices. I've read about the ~300ms delay waiting for 'double tap'. But that's not the issue for me, the issue is that it requires 1 tap to activate, another tap to activate the :hover <-- I'd like it to just be 1 tap. What can I do?
[01:57:09] <mogaj> Hi i am trying to open jquery ui dialog box in center of page but it is going under top menu the screenshot of the page : http://ubuntuone.com/5ACEkr0LEUYeTSdPvzfr76  ... The code in js file is http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/n9uUJ/ what should i do to make the dialog go under the top menu? pls guide
[01:57:44] <Cork> mogaj: are you using height: 'auto' ?
[01:58:22] <mogaj> Cork : i am using height: 600
[01:58:31] <Cork> hmm
[01:58:52] <Cork> mogaj: ah, is the dialog very high?
[01:59:07] <mogaj> Corey, yes
[01:59:08] <Cork> or rather is it taking up most of the display height
[01:59:49] <mogaj> Cork, yes it is a form which is rather long so i am setting height and scrolling to fill full form
[01:59:56] <Cork> mogaj: you can try fiddling with the position option
[02:00:21] <Cork> but ya, it tries to position it self centered by default
[02:00:29] <Cork> and as it doesn't know about the bar it can't take it into account
[02:00:32] <mogaj> Corey, i did but no success
[02:00:54] <mogaj> can see my code once please http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/n9uUJ/
[02:00:59] <mogaj> *you
[02:01:11] <mogaj> Corey, ^
[02:01:17] <Cork> wrong nick :)
[02:01:21] <Cork> mogaj: http://api.jqueryui.com/position/
[02:01:30] <Cork> try the different options from there
[02:01:49] <mogaj> Cork, sorry
[02:01:59] <Cork> no prob
[02:02:17] <Cork> its just that you kept on highlighting someone that isn't interested in the convo :)
[02:02:45] <DRSK> Cork ¬ª any idea how to solve :hover on devices as described above? :)
[02:03:01] <Cork> DRSK: hover and touch doesn't work at all as far as i know
[02:03:30] <DRSK> Cork ¬ª oh, well it does. It's just misbehaving really. So I'd like to make sure it works as I want it to on devices. Any suggestions?
[02:03:50] <Cork> DRSK: not really no
[02:04:35] <Cork> i see hover as something that shouldn't be used on touch, just like touchmove shouldn't be used on desktop
[02:05:37] <DRSK> Cork ¬ª http://jsfiddle.net/vu9ct/
[02:06:22] <DRSK> Cork ¬ª I understand that abusing :hover isn't a good practice, but for this special occasion I'm forced to use :hover on that element. What I need to do is make sure the content is visible on devices as well, but I'm drawing a blank on how to do such a thing ;p Thought perhaps you had an idea or two?
[02:06:49] <Cork> DRSK: what i meant, i don't have any experience fiddling with it
[02:07:09] <Cork> cause i build the system to not use hover when i write for touch devices
[02:07:28] <Cork> so i don't even know the basics of how hover can at all work on them
[02:07:28] <DRSK> ah, good point. I started in the wrong end I guess ;p
[02:07:52] <Cork> and i'm the wrong person to ask cause of that
[02:08:04] <DRSK> I understand, thanks for explaining :)
[02:08:05] <Cork> as i would have to find what hack fires the hover event in touch situations
[02:11:32] <mogaj> Cork, dialog going under fixed top menu ... :(
[02:12:08] <Cork> mogaj: you might be able to do something with z-index if position isn't helpful
[02:12:44] <mogaj> Cork,  z-index for dialog ?
[02:12:49] <Cork> yes
[02:13:22] <xec> DRSK: i made this earlier, but it doesn't seem to work very well, at least not on my iphone4
[02:13:30] <xec> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/vu9ct/1/
[02:15:43] <DRSK> xec ¬ª yes that is very close indeed, it's just the first tap that is "bugged" for me, the 2nd functions exactly as I imagined it would :)
[02:17:02] <DRSK> xec ¬ª I guess one way would be to remove :hover entirely and bind it to hover for desktops and touchstart/end for devices and apply the classes accordingly rather than using :hover but yeah, hrmph.
[02:17:22] <xec> yeah that's what that demo is doing
[02:17:32] <DRSK> oh right, doh
[02:17:42] <mogaj> Cork, Thankyou z-index worked :)
[02:17:49] <DRSK> wonder if touchend is better and perhaps add/remove class instead of toggling it, something is missfiring
[02:18:20] <Cork> mogaj: i might have missunderstood what you mean by "under the menu"
[02:18:30] <Cork> mogaj: i though you wanted to move the dialog downwards
[02:18:43] <Cork> while z-index might be what you looked for all along :/
[02:19:37] <nawi> why is .trigger("click") only executed after the mouseup event? The user first presses down "mousedown", then I trigger the click, but the click executes only after the user stops pressing the button
[02:20:08] <mogaj> Cork, downwards or above the top menu will work ... i could not figure out both so i came here :)
[02:20:11] <xec> DRSK: there is something odd going on indeed, it's not better even with the basic "click"
[02:20:20] <xec> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/vu9ct/2/show
[02:21:58] <DRSK> xec ¬ª yeah, same thing there - 1st tap is not being considered (or, it's just activating the 'control of the box') whereas the 2nd does what it should. Weird indeed!
[02:22:11] <xec> DRSK: no just tap once and wait
[02:22:14] <xec> its just slow
[02:22:23] <xec> hell i think i know why, hold on
[02:22:47] <xec> yeah its the blur effect
[02:22:48] <DRSK> that could be the ~300ms delay built in
[02:23:00] <xec> check out http://jsfiddle.net/vu9ct/5/
[02:23:26] <xec> the blur effect is intensive so it slows it down
[02:23:27] <DRSK> wow
[02:23:31] <xec> lol
[02:24:05] <DRSK> Yeah I can live without blur on devices I guess, damn that's resourceful?
[02:26:18] <DRSK> xec ¬ª fells like I need to do some .no-touch stuff
[02:26:39] <hellothere> Goodmorning people
[02:26:46] <hellothere> loads of love to all
[02:27:00] <hellothere> anyone knows about that mobile browser recognition thing?
[02:27:02] <xec> DRSK: yeah that would do the trick
[02:27:12] <DRSK> bah, and I've been waiting for such a long time to make a blur effect :/
[02:27:20] <DRSK> oh well, thanks for helping me xec !
[02:27:24] <xec> you could pre-blur it
[02:27:26] <hellothere> I want to run to my site a jquery check and if user is running my site on a mobile it will pop him an alert saying hey there is an app out there;)
[02:27:31] <xec> like have two images :P
[02:28:01] <DRSK> xec ¬ª aye but it's another http request, I guess I'll have to wait another year or two :D
[02:52:07] <wesleyh> is it possible to get the ajax request url from a .done handler? instead of just the response
[02:54:02] <systemfault> wesleyh: Try console.log()ing the third parameter of the .done callback
[02:54:12] <systemfault> Not 100% sure but it's probably in there.
[02:54:12] <wesleyh> actually just found out this.url works
[02:54:19] <systemfault> Great :)
[02:54:20] <wesleyh> no param needed
[02:54:24] <wesleyh> :)

[03:21:17] <nicolas_FR> hi there
[03:21:52] <nicolas_FR> I've got some problems with asynchronous script loading. Anyone could look at it please ? : http://jsfiddle.net/T88WD/
[03:28:28] <d3m0n> How can I get slice to only hide within it's class http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/vkgBA
[03:31:02] <Cork> d3m0n: within?
[03:31:39] <Cork> you mean you want to show the first 4 elements in each list?
[03:31:47] <d3m0n> Cork: correct
[03:32:28] <Cork> you can't use slice for that
[03:33:30] <d3m0n> Can you suggest an alternative?
[03:34:07] <Cork> d3m0n: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JnxEA
[03:34:31] <Cork> or you could do it all in css
[03:35:02] <Cork> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JnxEA
[03:35:12] <Cork> opps replaced the old one...
[03:35:25] <Cork> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/hsJab
[03:35:33] <d3m0n> Hrmm I guess I didn't think about that
[03:36:28] <d3m0n> Thanks Cork, I'll see if that works for what I am doing.
[03:38:59] <murosai_> is someone familiar with jstree3? i'm not sure if create_node commands actually adds the node to the tree?
[03:54:59] <mepl> I have this code, http://jsfiddle.net/BD6jg/1/ however when I search in the search field, both my select get their options removed. My jquery does not select only the closest. How can I only remove the options in the closest select from the input text?
[03:55:37] <Cork> mepl: what triggers the code?
[03:55:53] <Cork> mepl: btw having the same id on two elements is invalid
[03:57:04] <Cork> mepl: additionally foosel is an id not a class
[03:57:11] <Cork> and it is a child of #foo not a parent
[03:57:13] <mepl> invalid in what sense? I know it is not proper html but from my experience jquery does not give a damn
[03:57:15] <Cork> so you can't use .closest
[03:57:24] <Cork> mepl: yes it does
[03:57:42] <Cork> only one element can be selected by id
[03:58:01] <Cork> css cares less about id then js do actually
[03:58:29] <Cork> mepl: if you have multiple elements with the same id you have to treat the id as an attribute not an id
[03:58:35] <Cork> cause else you can't select all elements
[03:58:43] <mepl> keyup triggers the code, and I've changed it to class now.
[03:58:46] <Cork> so you should be using a class if you want it on multiple elements
[03:58:57] <mepl> still does not remove any option now
[03:58:59] <Cork> the second problem then .closest
[04:00:19] <mepl> http://jsfiddle.net/BD6jg/2/
[04:00:21] <mepl> this is my new code
[04:00:47] <mepl> shouldnt that jquery piece work?
[04:00:57] <Cork> mepl: again .foosel is a CHILD not a parent
[04:01:25] <Cork> you can't find a child while searching through the list of parents
[04:01:33] <Cork> ?api closest
[04:01:33] <b-ot> Cork: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[04:01:45] <Cork> "progressing up through the DOM tree"
[04:01:46] <mehrdad> hello , does anyone know how can i subscribe to jqgrid triggered events?
[04:02:32] <Cork> mepl: also you haven't answered when this code runs
[04:06:00] <mehrdad> got it
[04:15:29] <nicolas_FR> I'm really stuck with this problem of async loading, if anyone is looking... http://jsfiddle.net/T88WD/
[04:25:51] <hellothere> Hey there, I want to detect mobiles and redirect them in a different page anyone any thoughts? ive searched online, and some of them seem kinda old
[04:27:41] <murosai_> what's !== supposed to mean?
[04:28:06] <Cork> hellothere: http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/
[04:28:07] <xec> murosai_: it's not
[04:28:18] <a_fejer> That's the javascript equivalent of not equals
[04:28:25] <Cork> murosai_: it is the not form of ===
[04:28:31] <Cork> a_fejer: it is more then that
[04:28:34] <kk_drop> in bootstrap I have anchor links in menu and it scroll automatically nice to page position. but I would like to change this position by 50px up - how can I do it - to scroll to the anchor + 50px?
[04:28:36] <hellothere> thx Cork ive looked into that but cant seem to find where to download the actual redirect script, i seem only to find the agents and detect
[04:29:11] <Cork> murosai_: == is checking if the value is "like" each other
[04:29:19] <Cork> murosai_: ex. "1" == 1
[04:29:31] <Cork> while === checks if they are the exact same thing
[04:29:45] <Cork> js> print("1" == 1)
[04:29:51] <b-ot> Cork: true
[04:29:52] <Cork> js> print("1" === 1)
[04:30:00] <b-ot> Cork: false
[04:30:01] <Cork> js> print("1" != 1)
[04:30:11] <b-ot> Cork: false
[04:30:12] <Cork> js> print("1" !== 1)
[04:30:14] <slax0r> == casts both to same type, while === doesn't
[04:30:17] <b-ot> Cork: true
[04:30:45] <Cork> hellothere: it doesn't provide redirects, that you write your self
[04:30:57] <Cork> hellothere: it provides the sniffing string though
[04:31:18] <hellothere> ye ive seen that Cork is there any examples on how to use the sniffs?
[04:31:20] <Cork> hellothere: also you should have a specific landing page where you do this, so mobile can still choose to jump to desktop
[04:31:35] <Cork> hellothere: the sniff is exactly what they provide...
[04:31:45] <mogaj> Getting error 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeName' of null' the code where the error is occuring is http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/dSeaR/ what am i doing wrong? pls guide
[04:31:55] <hellothere> ye my main thought was having a modal that pops up with the mobile app and if its cancelled then it returns back to the site
[04:32:24] <hellothere> yes but how can i use the sniff to define things, like if iphone == true {redirect ... }
[04:33:26] <Cork> hellothere: you usually shouldn't try to identify the device type
[04:33:28] <a_fejer> I have some section on a page which is set to display:none. The page can be loaded with an anchor id in the URL. Can I get the anchor string from the URL with jquery, find the section which contains the tag with the id and turn the section visible?
[04:33:34] <Cork> or brand rather
[04:34:03] <hellothere> ye but if you want to make an install app version you need to know if its an iphone or android
[04:34:11] <hellothere> so you can redirect the installation to the right store
[04:34:45] <Cork> hellothere: there is more then android and iphone
[04:35:14] <Cork> and the problem is securely identifying more then if it is a mobile device or not
[04:35:14] <elgoots> im using jquery roller theme ( jquery ui) and it submits a form fine, however when i dont fill in the *required fields and it reloads the page and highlights what is required the submit button doesnt work anymore?
[04:35:45] <hellothere> i have apps only for iphone and andorid so the others will be redirected to a web mobile version of the site
[04:36:19] <Cork> hellothere: then you need to fine a site providing a complext regex that group up the different android devices and iphones
[04:36:25] <Cork> and excludes all the other mobile devices
[04:36:52] <elgoots> if someone could have a look at the webpage i would be very thankful. i have searched google for hours and have not been able to resolve what seems like a easy fix.
[04:36:57] <a_fejer> hellothere: i have an iPad browser which allows me to choose which browser agent i want to show to website. I can even choose an internet explorer or android browser.
[04:37:49] <a_fejer> not sure if it's that easy to show content by devices, brands or browser agents
[04:37:50] <hellothere> a_fejer: then its different its not a security breach for me, being able to bypass that. I just want to show that the mobile app is available
[04:38:08] <hellothere> i am not gonna target individuals that have differnt mobile browsers or even custom made ones
[04:39:27] <elgoots> anyone?
[04:39:34] <Cork> hellothere: exactly, so you need to identify them from the ones that are android/iphones and not just trying to be similar enough in the ua
[04:40:06] <Cork> hellothere: ua sniffing is a mess, and going to specifics becomes hairy very fast
[04:40:18] <xec> elgoots: could you make a jsfiddle demo that illustrates the issue?
[04:40:47] <elgoots> i dont think so, because the form is dynamic  :/
[04:40:51] <elgoots> http://www.expressmobileservices.com.au/island-getaway-to-hamilton-island/
[04:41:00] <elgoots> if you dont fill in anything and press submit
[04:41:16] <elgoots> it will show the required fields you missed. then try press submit again and the submit button no longer works
[04:41:25] <elgoots> if i remove the jquery roller theme it works fine
[04:42:33] <fattest>  why isn't my animate working for my show hide? http://jsfiddle.net/3pSat/
[04:43:29] <xec> and the only difference is the theme?
[04:43:55] <elgoots> yeah, if i remove the jquery it works fine
[04:44:05] <Cork> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/3pSat/1/
[04:45:03] <fattest> Cork: thank you very much!
[04:47:12] <jop008> I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/RhWgf/498/ works fine. IN my actual code the tr of the table is created by concatenating strings and the injected as $("#tbody").html (chtml); I can not trap the TR click event. In the fiddle it works fine
[04:47:20] <jop008> Any idea?
[04:48:00] <fabioportieri> jop008: try with .on() in the delegated form
[04:48:57] <a_fejer> I have some section on a page which is set to display:none. The page can be loaded with an frag id in the URL. Can I get the frag id string from the URL with jquery, find the section which contains the tag with the id and turn the section visible?
[04:49:07] <jop008> So change this   $('#srch_results td').click(function () { in?
[04:49:08] <jop008>  
[04:49:20] <elgoots> i wonder if there is a some javascript i can load that on page ready or on document ready that it reloads the button ?
[04:49:24] <fabioportieri> jop008: change that in go read .on() doc
[04:49:24] <systemfault> a_fejer: location.hash ?
[04:49:39] <Cork> jop008: i think we've talked about this quite a few times by now
[04:49:46] <Cork> jop008: you should know how delegate works
[04:50:07] <fabioportieri> jop008: you are here to learn, not to get spoonfeeded
[04:50:25] <fattest> Cork: how do I make it so that if i click on the text again, it'll close? http://jsfiddle.net/3pSat/4/
[04:50:31] <ankurk_> jop008: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[04:50:36] <a_fejer> systemfault: yes, that might help, i'll give it a try
[04:50:37] <a_fejer> thx
[04:50:55] <jop008> But whay is it not working when injecting html?
[04:50:58] <Cork> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/3pSat/5/
[04:51:22] <fabioportieri> because the element is not in the dom yet
[04:51:25] <Cork> jop008: cause you are still adding the listener to the element
[04:51:44] <Cork> so only elements that exist when the selector lists the elements will have an event listener
[04:52:21] <jop008> so what is the problem with that?
[04:52:39] <Cork> ...
[04:53:01] <Cork> well it works fine if you don't want elements added later to get the listeners
[04:54:22] <elgoots> no one has any ideas on how to fix my problem?
[04:54:45] <Cork> elgoots: you might have to ask the question again
[04:54:54] <jop008> I got it working  $("#srch_results").delegate("td","click",function(){ but I don't know why :-(
[04:55:56] <elgoots> http://www.expressmobileservices.com.au/island-getaway-to-hamilton-island/   if you dont fill in anything and press submit it will show the required fields you missed. then try press submit again and the submit button no longer works. if i remove the jquery roller theme it works fine
[04:56:04] <ankurk_> I think I delegate is deprecated
[04:56:09] <bengalo> what u usually want, is something like $('#srch_results').on('click', 'td', function() { ... });
[04:56:32] <fattest> Cork: instead of class, how can i use ID? do i use #initial?
[04:56:32] <jop008> yes
[04:56:56] <jop008> and on click doesn't work
[04:56:57] <ankurk_> I think he wants something like this $(document).on('click', '#srch_results td', function() {});
[04:57:09] <Cork> fattest: yes, #<id> and id="<id>"
[04:57:18] <fabioportieri> jop008: that's why i said go read the doc
[04:57:48] <bengalo> jop008, look at my example, then read the docs why that works
[04:58:00] <jop008> The doc are widespread out learning by doing is faster than reading
[04:58:15] <ankurk_> but you gotta read something before doing anything
[04:58:24] <bengalo> well, people tell you exactly what to look for
[04:58:29] <bengalo> so that shouldnt be that hard to do
[04:58:43] <jop008> example?
[04:59:12] <Cork> jop008: we arn't here to write the code for you
[04:59:13] <fabioportieri> jop008: but you aren't learning shit, you only ask for the solution
[04:59:15] <bengalo> well, we gave you the line, so you might wanna check the .on event
[04:59:36] <bengalo> smh ;)
[04:59:37] <Cork> we are here to give you hints on how to solve the problem you might come up against, and help you figure out how to solve it
[04:59:48] <Cork> + the best way
[04:59:48] <jop008> Ask for a hint not for a solution
[04:59:56] <effortDee> Cork++
[04:59:56] <ramin> hey I am trying to do a ajax call but I get the error msg:  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :   I know the json result is valid. this is how the call looks like: http://pastebin.com/RTMNfgPv
[05:00:06] <fabioportieri> jop008: you are a help vampire dude
[05:00:20] <Cork> fabioportieri: that isn't really called for
[05:00:31] <Cork> calling names dosen't help
[05:00:41] <systemfault> ramin: You need to decide, are you using JSON or JSONP?
[05:00:52] <ramin> jsonp its not my server
[05:00:58] <fabioportieri> Cork: spoonfeed users that don't want to learn is bad too
[05:01:16] <Cork> fabioportieri: sure, then talk with them about it, don't call them names
[05:01:20] <systemfault> ramin: Is the JSONP properly generated on the server?
[05:01:48] <murosai_> i saw this line in my code (function(state) { -- what's it supposed to mean?
[05:01:54] <Cork> ramin: note jsonp is javascript not json
[05:02:00] <ramin> I am not sure about that. I need to check that. this can be the reason
[05:02:12] <Cork> murosai_: check the end of the declaration
[05:02:15] <ramin> so the call needs to be differentﬂ
[05:02:17] <ramin> ?
[05:02:18] <Cork> you most likely have })()
[05:02:30] <Cork> murosai_: the variable inside the () is passed to state
[05:02:40] <elgoots> Cork: did you see my question i re-posted for you?
[05:02:44] <Cork> murosai_: that is a scope/self executing function/so on
[05:02:57] <Cork> elgoots: opps got dragged off track...
[05:03:07] <systemfault> ramin: Usually... jQuery will do a call to your server with a GET parameter called "callback" or something else with the value being the name of a function to return from the PHP script
[05:03:45] <elgoots> dont apoligise. your volunteering not working for me  :)
[05:03:46] <Cork> elgoots: line 15 won't work in multiple ways
[05:03:50] <systemfault> ramin: http://backend.trxp.eu/productList.php might be called like http://backend.trxp.eu/productList.php?callback=hello ... and then the server needs to return: hello(JSON_HERE);
[05:03:55] <a_fejer> can I use .parent(".cssClass") if the tag i'm looking for is not a direct parent but a tag higher in the hierarchy?
[05:03:56] <ramin> can I somehow remotely check if json is properly setup on the server ?
[05:03:58] <murosai_> Cork: do you mean like for example in case of  (function(state) {}(my_state); my_state is passed to state?
[05:04:09] <Cork> elgoots: 1. it runs before the elements exist so it won't find them
[05:04:23] <elgoots> oh right. sorry that was me trying to fix the problem that still exists
[05:04:28] <systemfault> ramin: In your case, it doesn't return JSONP, only JSON
[05:04:28] <Cork> elgoots: and it is static, so if something gets the .ui-state-disabled after the line runs, nothing will change
[05:04:33] <elgoots> even if i remove all that it still remains
[05:04:39] <bengalo> a_fejer check .closest(classorwhatever)
[05:04:47] <a_fejer> thx
[05:04:55] <Cork> elgoots: secondly !important; doesn't work in inline style attributes
[05:05:08] <Cork> they are always important, so no point for the !important;
[05:05:17] <ramin> oh if I just put json I get a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"...
[05:05:21] <Cork> (inline style always win)
[05:05:26] <elgoots> good point  :)
[05:05:35] <elgoots> habbit
[05:05:57] <Cork> elgoots: and when i see it </p> <-- no <p> so what is it closing? :D
[05:06:04] <ramin> just calling http://backend.trxp.eu/productList.php in the borwser returns json
[05:06:24] <elgoots> i know, but it still runs with jquery off  :/
[05:06:47] <murosai_> it seems like every .js file seem to begin with this (function(state) type of pattern, is this usually considered good or bad practise?
[05:07:27] <elgoots> Cork: i just updated and removed that javascript in the head
[05:07:40] <Cork> elgoots: have you checked so the event attribute isn't causing it?
[05:07:52] <Cork> onclick='if(window["gf_submitting_4"]){return false;}  window["gf_submitting_4"]=true; ' <--
[05:07:56] <elgoots> yeah i took that out   :)
[05:08:21] <elgoots> ah im not sure if i can take that out, its dynamic pulling from gravity forms in wordpress
[05:08:49] <elgoots> thats why i was hoping someone had a javascript solution i could execute at the very bottom under that
[05:08:55] <elgoots> to reset the submit button
[05:09:33] <Cork> elgoots: the code takes my head for a tour, having a bit of a struggle finding where things happen
[05:09:48] <fattest> Cork: instead of "$(".test2").children('.content').hide();" can we use anything else other than .children to search the whole code and not just in the div class test2?
[05:09:53] <Cork> might be my distast for jqm...
[05:10:09] <Cork> fattest: .find()
[05:10:20] <Cork> or just add it to the first selector
[05:10:28] <Cork> $(".test2 .content')
[05:10:42] <elgoots> cork: try refreshing now, i just deleted the first section  :)
[05:12:27] <Cork> elgoots: ya it is the inline onclick blocking the submit
[05:12:42] <Cork> window["gf_submitting_4"] == true
[05:12:47] <elgoots> oh darn
[05:12:48] <Cork> so it returns false;
[05:13:01] <elgoots> no way to hack that using code in header or under that is there?
[05:13:20] <Cork> you could try something like $('').removeAttr('onclick')
[05:13:35] <Cork> as it isn't an event listener you can't really handle it well in code
[05:13:57] <elgoots> so i couldnt do document load and then run that function?
[05:14:15] <Cork> that should work ya
[05:14:34] <Cork> what i meant you can't handle it with event listeners
[05:14:41] <fattest> Cork: do you understand why it is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/tjwAC/1/ (already shows on load and toggle doesn't work)
[05:15:24] <elgoots> ok well im sure ill find someway, just keep hitting my head against the keyboard for long enough. It will happen. Thank you very much for your time Cork. I really appreciate your help   :)
[05:15:31] <umberleigh> hi is there any way to embed a full html page (complete with html, body tags etc) in another page without resorting to an iframe?
[05:15:58] <elgoots> umberleigh, this would be server side?
[05:16:06] <elgoots> or external url?
[05:16:25] <umberleigh> elgoots: yeah, server side. everything's coming from the same site.
[05:16:50] <umberleigh> am trying to display html e-mails properly.
[05:17:09] <elgoots> php?
[05:17:14] <umberleigh> yeah, cakephp
[05:17:51] <elgoots> so couldnt you just use the include ?
[05:18:03] <Cork> fattest: don't run ready inside .load http://jsfiddle.net/tjwAC/3/
[05:18:47] <ankurk_> xKraty is not online today -> Me Sad :P
[05:18:47] <umberleigh> elgoots: will that still render any stylesheets inside the container and not effect the rest of the page?
[05:19:10] <Cork> umberleigh: <object> can hold a page too
[05:19:23] <Cork> umberleigh: but no html doesn't allow a full page inside body
[05:19:30] <Cork> so you need a separate dom to embed it
[05:20:11] <Cork> umberleigh: if you load a stylesheet from one page on another they will affect the full page
[05:20:15] <umberleigh> cork: how would a separate dom work? didn't know you could do that short of using framesets (ergh) or an iframe
[05:20:18] <elgoots> <script>$('#box').load('search.php?q=1');</script>
[05:20:18] <elgoots> <div ID="box"></div>
[05:20:35] <elgoots> then style the box with full width
[05:20:54] <Cork> umberleigh: <object src="path/to/page.html"></object> or ya an iframe
[05:21:02] <Cork> umberleigh: those will build a separate document
[05:21:28] <elgoots> Cork, are they still supported in latest browsers?
[05:21:30] <Cork> umberleigh: if you want to embed them in the current document (any other solution) you need to create fragments
[05:21:38] <Cork> elgoots: onclick?
[05:21:48] <Cork> or what?
[05:21:53] <fattest> Cork: thank you very much! How are you so experiened with jquery?
[05:22:08] <elgoots> lol sorry cork. no the include page using onject
[05:22:10] <elgoots> object
[05:22:20] <Cork> fattest: not really jquery, i'v been doing js for close to 20 years :)
[05:22:25] <Cork> elgoots: yes they are
[05:22:38] <Cork> embed is depricated, but most likely won't ever be removed
[05:22:51] <fattest> Cork: well im 17 and im learning JS and php !
[05:22:58] <umberleigh> cork, elgoots: cheers, gives me a couple of things to look into.
[05:23:05] <elgoots> ah thats the one i was thinking of
[05:24:27] <Cork> fattest: heh to be exact i started 96 so... :)
[05:24:49] <Cork> did pascal/c/asm before that >_>
[05:25:02] <seutje> think I only started about a year or 2 later
[05:25:10] <seutje> as I was like 10 in 96
[05:25:30] <seutje> but my dad got me hooked on BASIC pretty early on
[05:26:13] <Cork> ya, i my sisters boyfriend at the time showed me two lines of qbasic(91)
[05:26:18] <Cork> got me hooked on coding
[05:26:30] <Cork> did scripting before that :/
[05:27:00] <seutje> stayed up the entire night one time when I was like 8, making a pong clone. My dad did most of the coding, but watching how empowering it is got me hooked instantly
[05:27:22] <Cork> heh ya, i did long coding streaks back in the day too
[05:27:26] <mehrdad> swapNode() isn't standard html method?
[05:27:31] <Cork> my longest was over two days >_>
[05:27:38] <seutje> `mdn swapnode
[05:27:40] <b-ot> seutje: Node.replaceChild - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.replaceChild
[05:28:02] <mehrdad> nope, that's another method
[05:28:16] <mehrdad> swapNode is just great simplification
[05:28:24] <Cork> its ie only i think
[05:28:47] <seutje> yeah, can only find references on msdn
[05:29:12] <seutje> pretty easy to plug though
[05:29:31] <mehrdad> i'm not sure why my experience differs from the majority of web developers, but i have always had less issues with internet explorer than others , esp firefox
[05:30:10] <basiclaser> hey guys i would like to make a page with 8 buttons, which have on and off states, can someone point me at a simple tutorial?
[05:30:22] <mehrdad> blame me all you want, but it just has been an smoother experience , less hassle as long as you don't take into account cross browser compatibility
[05:30:26] <Cork> mehrdad: it is quite simple to do with just .insertBefore()
[05:31:25] <Cork> mehrdad: if you developer ie centric you have less problems with ie
[05:31:27] <mehrdad> hmm
[05:31:43] <Cork> mehrdad: but instead you have problem with every other standard compliant browser
[05:31:52] <Cork> :)
[05:31:54] <mehrdad> wasn't aware of that method, as searching for swapping felt more natural
[05:31:56] <Cork> i've seen it before
[05:32:00] <mehrdad> hence why i found it first
[05:32:37] <mehrdad> true
[05:33:29] <Cork> it was a common report pattern back in ~2006
[05:33:43] <Cork> developers complained that things was broken in firefox
[05:34:11] <mehrdad> it doesn't work
[05:34:17] <mehrdad> at first try anyway
[05:34:19] <Cork> to the point where they complained that vbs didn't work...
[05:34:21] <Cork> or activex
[05:34:32] <Cork> mehrdad: it works differently
[05:34:37] <mehrdad> i don't think that is a solution
[05:34:38] <mehrdad> yeah right
[05:34:46] <mehrdad> translates to more code
[05:34:58] <Cork> you need to grab the following element after one of the element
[05:35:04] <Cork> then move the second element before the first
[05:35:13] <Cork> and the first before the element that was after the second
[05:35:22] <Cork> (as the second element has moved by this time)
[05:36:07] <mehrdad> what about moveRow()? is it also ie specific ?
[05:36:45] <Cork> mehrdad: var elmref = elm2.nextSibling(); parent.insertBefore(elm2, elm1).insertBefore(elm1, elmref);
[05:36:51] <hellothere> is it possible to change the alert messag
[05:37:00] <hellothere> alert* function to have more buttons etc?
[05:37:02] <chase> I'm not sure what I'm doing differently, but my jquery functions are all returning arrays of HTML objects, not jQuery objects
[05:37:22] <Cork> mehrdad: i don't think that is a native method at all
[05:37:39] <Cork> mehrdad: at least it looks way to table sentric
[05:37:58] <Cork> hmm
[05:38:02] <Cork> ya, it is ie only again
[05:39:17] <chase> anyone know why my $(this) returns an html object and not a jquery object?
[05:39:35] <mehrdad> believe me, i'd rather have cleaner and more mature api than care for a specific browser's incompatibilities, alas the real world isn't always in out favor
[05:39:49] <mehrdad> our *
[05:39:58] <Cork> chase: $ isn't jquery
[05:40:32] <mehrdad> w3c should just incorporate those APIs
[05:40:38] <chase> Cork: $("#div-id") then
[05:40:43] <mehrdad> it's stupid to do otherwise
[05:41:49] <Cork> chase: there are other libs that supports selectors through $
[05:42:10] <Jattenalle> chase, some other library/thing is using $, so $ is not a jquery function
[05:42:12] <chase> Cork: I understand that, but I'm not using them
[05:42:18] <elgoots> Cork: will this work? <script type="application/javascript">
[05:42:18] <elgoots>   $('gform_submit_button_4').removeAttr('onclick')
[05:42:18] <elgoots>   </script>
[05:42:23] <Jattenalle> chase, link your code?
[05:42:28] <Cork> chase: if $ is jquery $.fn.jquery should be the version number string
[05:42:28] <chase> $ defined as jQuery
[05:42:38] <chase> Cork: one second
[05:44:30] <chase> Cork: 1.7.2
[05:44:44] <Cork> ah
[05:44:55] <Cork> wait where are you using this?
[05:44:59] <Cork> this might not be a dom element
[05:45:22] <chase> Chrome console (also inside the script tag of my  rails page)
[05:45:39] <Cork> so in global scope?
[05:45:45] <chase> correct
[05:45:52] <Cork> not sure then
[05:46:04] <Cork> this should be window there
[05:46:37] <chase> just yesterday before I switched branches $("blah blah") returned an Object. now i'm getting ["<blah>..</blah>"]
[05:47:07] <Cork> chase: you have a link to this page?
[05:47:23] <chase> no, i'm sorry. its on an internal lan
[05:47:39] <chase> I appreciate the offer tho
[05:47:40] <Cork> well all i can say is that jquery doesn't reaturn strings
[05:47:46] <Cork> *return
[05:49:28] <chase> its not a string
[05:49:44] <chase> i can call functions on [0]
[05:50:47] <chase> like firstChild
[05:52:12] <mehrdad> parent.insertBefore(elm1,elm2) = NotFoundError
[05:52:22] <mehrdad> Cork ^^
[05:52:32] <mehrdad> elm1 is already in the dom
[05:52:38] <Cork> do you have those three variables defined?
[05:52:50] <Cork> mehrdad: doesn't matter
[05:52:58] <Cork> if you insert a dom node again it moves
[05:53:04] <chase> ahh Cork ... the only thing I changed between switching branches was browsers.. FF -> Safari
[05:53:16] <mehrdad>  of course i'm using another names
[05:53:23] <mehrdad> doesn't seem to
[05:53:28] <chase> switching back to FF the selector returns an Object again
[05:53:31] <mehrdad> dg.insertBefore(currRow, prevRow);
[05:53:45] <mehrdad> wait
[05:55:50] <mehrdad> no it's correct
[05:55:55] <mehrdad> dg is the table
[05:58:04] <Cork> mehrdad: http://jsfiddle.net/pBtyx/1/
[05:59:01] <Cork> opps invalid id's...
[05:59:08] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pBtyx/2/
[06:02:30] <ramin> since the browser results json when I call a website doesnt that mean that CORS is activated on the server?
[06:02:59] <Cork> no
[06:03:13] <Cork> ramin: if you get json in the callback it means it though
[06:03:22] <Cork> unless you call jsonp that is
[06:03:40] <jeyoesle> Guys
[06:04:19] <jeyoesle> I've got a div, called #videos, and it contains many links <a>  which all have the same class .close_afterclick
[06:04:31] <jeyoesle> $('#videos').on('click', '.close_afterclick', function() {
[06:04:36] <jeyoesle> ^
[06:04:42] <jeyoesle> This is what i'm using to handle it
[06:04:47] <jeyoesle> BUT
[06:05:09] <jeyoesle> I need to fetch into the function  the 'src' attribute of the link that has been clicked,
[06:05:22] <Cork> $(this).attr('href')
[06:05:35] <Cork> links don't have src
[06:05:51] <ramin> in the browser no jsonp or?
[06:05:52] <jeyoesle> $(this) in this case means .close_afterclick  OR  #videos ?
[06:05:56] <ramin> I have no idea :|
[06:06:08] <Cork> jeyoesle: the element with the class
[06:06:15] <Cork> jeyoesle: as the handler is delegated
[06:06:25] <jeyoesle> okay, just to be sure :D
[06:06:36] <Cork> ramin: check the raw data you get from the server (the network tab in the console)
[06:06:36] <jeyoesle> thank you
[06:06:39] <Cork> np
[06:07:39] <Cork> lol?!? ‚Ç™ is a currency sign??
[06:08:00] <jeyoesle> wow amazing, it's fantastic only looking at it
[06:08:05] <jeyoesle> ‚Ç™
[06:08:15] <jeyoesle> Tin&yang ?
[06:08:18] <jeyoesle> *Yin
[06:08:24] <Cork> "NEW SHEQEL"
[06:08:37] <xec> what did you just call me?
[06:08:38] <seutje> can't even google that shit
[06:08:39] <seutje> `g ‚Ç™
[06:08:41] <b-ot> seutje: Sorry, no results for ‚Äü‚Ç™‚Äù.
[06:08:42] <ramin> what do I have to look for? the header or response, response looks like json
[06:08:45] <Cork> lol
[06:08:52] <jeyoesle> oh jewish stuff.. asd
[06:09:11] <jeyoesle> I knew that.. they're too smart for my tastes :S
[06:09:21] <Cork> ramin: ok, if the response doesn't have () around the json it is most likely json
[06:09:44] <Cork> ramin: you can check the header Content-Type to get a bit more sure (if the server is configured correctly
[06:10:15] <Cork> ramin: also when your there check the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
[06:10:45] <Cork> if Access-Control-Allow-Origin is is there and content-type is application/json
[06:10:54] <Cork> then ya your are looking at cors + json
[06:11:44] <ramin> Response Content-Type:text/html
[06:11:56] <Cork> then no you arn't looking at json
[06:12:05] <Cork> your looking at broken html
[06:12:09] <ramin> can see anything saying about Access-Control, ...
[06:12:24] <Cork> then it isn't cors either
[06:13:00] <_bart> Howdy, I'm using jQuery Mobile, and I want to remove the text-shadow of the body text, text-shadow: 0 0 0; doesn't work. It turns the shadow into a 0px offset white one, which still shows as pixelation around the text!
[06:13:01] <ramin> mh so I can write the hosts a mail. I should request for CORS ?
[06:13:10] <ramin> or jsonp?
[06:13:28] <Jattenalle> _bart, text-shadow: none;
[06:13:41] <Cork> ramin: if they provide an open api, they should fix both the content-type and the cors header
[06:13:49] <Cork> ramin: though they might not want it open
[06:14:02] <Cork> ramin: or they might provide a jsonp
[06:14:05] <ramin> we are collaborators
[06:14:16] <Cork> ramin: providing both should be easy to implement
[06:14:24] <Cork> but cors is safer
[06:14:39] <Cork> so i would go for json + cors
[06:14:51] <Cork> hmm
[06:14:53] <Cork> actually
[06:14:54] <ramin> okay cool. but then http://pastebin.com/RTMNfgPv is not th right call is it? it says jsonp
[06:14:59] <Cork> ramin: cors is broken in ie
[06:15:05] <Cork> so you might actually want to go with jsonp
[06:15:22] <ramin> ha
[06:15:24] <Cork> at least it was in ie10
[06:15:53] <Cork> they MIGHT finally got there ass in gear and implemented support for it in xmlhttprequest
[06:16:03] <Cork> bit i guess you need bigger support the ie11
[06:16:22] <Cork> bit==but
[06:16:56] <ramin> mmh I yeah. the more sites use cors, the more they will be pushed maybe :p
[06:17:15] <Cork> ramin: well they support cors; kinda
[06:17:25] <Cork> but you need to use XDomain (ie only)
[06:17:37] <Cork> and you need to implement paring the data server side
[06:17:50] <Cork> cause www-url-encoded isn't supported >_<
[06:18:09] <Cork> so no server can handles form data through XDomain by default
[06:18:21] <Cork> meaning completely broken in my book
[06:18:57] <ramin> oh man.
[06:19:05] <Cork> heh unicode has poker markers ‚õÄ
[06:19:11] <ramin> anyway thanks for your help. saved me some hours for sure :)
[06:19:14] <Cork> even piles of them ‚õÅ
[06:19:33] <Cork> ramin: np
[06:20:46] <v0id3d> So i just want to let you guys know the links you gave me yesterday kept me up all night wow you can do a whole lot w/ jQuery with next to no codeing
[06:20:59] <seutje> unicode is üí©!
[06:21:06] <Cork> :)
[06:21:13] <Jattenalle> v0id3d, :D
[06:21:20] <Cork> v0id3d: ya, jquery helps if you want to be lazy ^^
[06:21:23] <seutje> bah, too bad OSX makes it all cartoony
[06:21:46] <Cork> seutje: sadly i don't have that char :/
[06:21:52] <hlvwrk> i like me some osx.
[06:21:59] <hlvwrk> how do you emoji on osx?
[06:22:01] <hlvwrk> o;
[06:22:01] <v0id3d> I had a classLib.php that most of it is done in jquery with less then 4 lines of code
[06:22:12] <v0id3d> it is a little sad but evolve or die
[06:22:21] <fabioportieri> trying to make box shadow working in ie... in ie9 i read that if the element is inside a table with border-collapse:collapse; it won't work.. so i set it to separate.. but it still won't work.. any idea?
[06:22:22] <seutje> Cork: it's poop
[06:22:26] <seutje> http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1F4A9/browsertest.htm
[06:22:27] <Cork> heh
[06:22:34] <Cork> ah
[06:23:07] <_bart> Jattenalle, thanks, that was easy haha
[06:23:18] <Jattenalle> _bart, sometimes it is :)
[06:23:22] <Cork> seutje: you know there are characters for the three wise monkeys too? :D
[06:23:24] <seutje> hlvwrk: OSX emoji are just hijacked unicode sequences
[06:24:01] <seutje> üôà üôâ üôä ?
[06:24:27] <seutje> u mean the see/hear/speak no evil, right?
[06:25:00] <Cork> ya
[06:25:39] <Cork> i love the name of the chars "SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY" XD
[06:25:55] <Cork> "HEAR-NO-EVIL MONKEY" and "SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY"
[06:26:16] <seutje> to think somebody got paid to put that in there
[06:26:26] <Cork> ya
[06:26:56] <Cork> its plain silly how many weird chars exists in unicode
[06:27:30] <seutje> sorta like google doodles
[06:27:38] <seutje> they have an entire team dedicated to that
[06:28:03] <Cork> true
[06:29:18] <v0id3d> when using the .ajax should if i do not set it to POST doesnt it just default to that?
[06:29:32] <v0id3d> haha bad wording
[06:29:32] <Cork> v0id3d: it defaults to get
[06:29:59] <Cork> v0id3d: the default values is listed in api.jquery.com
[06:30:05] <Cork> ?api jQuery.ajax
[06:30:05] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:30:40] <v0id3d> I see its set to get but if its sending data how is it set to get?
[06:30:48] <nicolas_FR> I'm really stuck with this problem of async loading, if anyone could say me if everything looks fine... http://jsfiddle.net/T88WD/
[06:31:00] <Cork> v0id3d: the data is converted to params
[06:31:09] <Cork> v0id3d: but yes you shouldn't send data over get
[06:31:18] <Cork> but you might want to send request data
[06:31:24] <v0id3d> yea i just corrected it
[06:31:44] <Cork> like $.ajax(url, { data: { q: searchTerm } });
[06:31:56] <v0id3d> o ok
[06:32:01] <Cork> results in url + '?q=search term'
[06:32:50] <v0id3d> got you
[06:33:21] <v0id3d> for instance i am going to make a warranty.php file and it is going to have many functions in it and i might want it to be ?q=sendform
[06:33:25] <fabioportieri> could someone help me to make this work in ie9 ? http://jsfiddle.net/D3UZY/1/
[06:33:27] <v0id3d> ?q=updatedb
[06:33:31] <v0id3d> so on and so forth
[06:34:20] <Cork> v0id3d: ya, warning though updatedb <-- be very careful when you expose commands to the net
[06:34:36] <Cork> the server should always make VERY sure that what is executed is safe
[06:34:42] <v0id3d> yea it wont be that
[06:34:50] <Cork> else you have a heap of security problems in you lap >_>
[06:35:10] <Cork> i've seen server scripts take sql from js...
[06:35:12] <Cork> made me cry
[06:35:20] <Cork> ... and rewrite the entire site >_<
[06:36:07] <Cork> fabioportieri: i don't think ie9 has box-shadow
[06:36:09] <v0id3d> I dont want to have a .php file for every site in my scripts dir you know
[06:36:10] <v0id3d> so i want to create just one
[06:36:10] <v0id3d> it might be ?q=home
[06:36:32] <v0id3d> ?q=warranty
[06:36:32] <v0id3d> so on from that maybe
[06:36:37] <Cork> v0id3d: i would look at url rewrite
[06:36:38] <fabioportieri> Cork: according to some reading it should work :http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5617455/box-shadow-on-ie9-doesnt-render-using-correct-css-works-on-firefox-chrome
[06:36:48] <Cork> v0id3d: and have the script get the url as a param
[06:36:56] <Cork> v0id3d: then you can still expose nice paths
[06:37:03] <Cork> (search engines like that)
[06:37:21] <Cork> fabioportieri: ya
[06:37:29] <Cork> had to look to remember though :)
[06:38:07] <Cork> don't see anything else that could trip up ie though
[06:38:11] <fabioportieri> i'll try change the doctype maybe it's that
[06:38:17] <Cork> no
[06:38:20] <sekyms> Is anyone  primarily using express right now?
[06:38:34] <Cork> as long as you have one of the different modern html doctypes it should work fine
[06:38:50] <Cork> sekyms: express what?
[06:39:41] <Cork> fabioportieri: sadly i'm not sure i have ie9 around right now >_>
[06:39:48] <_bart> jQuery Mobile changed the style of their slider. The holder is now square and the background of the slider doesn't color when you drag it. Any way to get the 'old' style back?
[06:39:56] <dwarder> Cork: be happy about it ;)
[06:39:58] <v0id3d> I think i am getting ahead of myself
[06:40:20] <Cork> i think i updated my vms to ie10 and 11
[06:40:47] <sekyms> is there a way to debug a script if it is loaded with jQuery.getScript()?
[06:40:55] <v0id3d> i am going to continue reading
[06:40:55] <v0id3d> hahaha
[06:41:12] <Cork> v0id3d: kinda but not really
[06:42:02] <Cork> ya...
[06:42:15] <Cork> fabioportieri: it works in ie10/11 though :)
[06:43:08] <mepl> var type= $('input[name=type]:checked', '.trunkformtemplate').val() this is what I use today to get the value of the checked radio button. However now I have more of these .trunkformtemplates so I need to grab the closest one. I've tried some stuff but never really got it to work.
[06:43:21] <mepl> $(this).closest('.trunk-inner').find('input[name=type]:checked', '.trunkformtemplate').val()
[06:43:24] <mepl> for an example
[06:43:44] <Cork> mepl: $('input[name=type]:checked', '.trunkformtemplate') isn't valid
[06:43:47] <v0id3d> so if I run jQuery.noConflict(); I need to run jQuery(function(){   }); instead of $(function (){   }); right?
[06:43:47] <mepl> ok my bad, the last one did actually work
[06:44:06] <Cork> v0id3d: yes
[06:44:23] <Cork> v0id3d: you can do jQuery(function($){ $() }) though
[06:44:41] <v0id3d> yea
[06:44:44] <v0id3d> ok
[06:45:11] <fabioportieri> Cork: i had already everything prepared for ie7-8.. and 9 fails me!
[06:45:55] <Cork> fabioportieri: i've stopped caring about ie < 9
[06:46:04] <Cork> and not much about ie9 either now days
[06:46:24] <Cork> ie8 should die 15/4 so :)
[06:46:32] <Cork> i'm happy
[06:47:20] <fabioportieri> those people here uses ie7-9 and can't upgrade :(
[06:47:29] <fabioportieri> friggin banks
[06:47:39] <Cork> fabioportieri: xp dies 15/4
[06:47:49] <Cork> and vista and 7 had ie9 by default
[06:48:53] <fabioportieri> i guess i have to extends the hacks for ie7-8 to 9 too
[06:50:43] <bberry> is this thing a bad idea to use? http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[06:51:34] <bberry> basically adds touch events to jquery ui
[06:51:41] <bberry> via monkey patch
[06:52:25] <Cork> bberry: no it isn't monkey patch
[06:52:28] <Cork> it is extending
[06:52:37] <bberry> on his site he claims it in a monkey patch
[06:52:42] <Cork> monkey patch means you actually modify the original source file
[06:52:44] <bberry> s/in/is*
[06:52:57] <Cork> bberry: i've used it on a few sites
[06:53:02] <Cork> and it has been stable this far
[06:53:07] <bberry> okay cool, ill use it then :D
[06:53:11] <Cork> admittedly i only use it for sliders though
[06:53:19] <bberry> yeah im just using it from draggables
[06:53:25] <Cork> (sliders is more or less the only think from ui i care about)
[06:53:36] <bberry> gotcha
[06:53:54] <Cork> but ya should work for draggable and sortable too
[06:54:35] <Colmea> Hey :) Is is possible that two ajax request (getJSON() ) called from two differents objects but with the same url request, are permuted between these two objects.
[06:55:45] <Colmea> In others words, I call ajax "myPage.json" on first object, then on the second object.   And the callback function from this second object is triggered by the first request (init with first object)
[06:56:50] <Colmea> (the two requests call the same page, but with differents params)
[07:06:14] <murosai_> i don't understand this line  var folderTree = $("#folderTree").on("loaded.jstree", function() { -- what's the value of folderTree, whatever the jQuery on function returns?
[07:08:21] <fabioportieri> murosai_: folderTree is the id of the element you're selecting, loaded.jstree is a custom event + namespace
[07:08:45] <murosai_> yes..
[07:10:05] <fabioportieri> that line is saying, when that event occurs, do something with #folderTree
[07:10:50] <murosai_> i was asking what's the value of folderTree
[07:11:35] <murosai_> and i think it seems the value is what $("#folderTree") returns instead of on(), which i don't understand
[07:11:45] <systemfault> murosai_: TIAS?
[07:12:13] <fabioportieri> uhm i'm not sure i understand what you asking
[07:12:56] <murosai_> systemfault: i did that and i don't understand the results
[07:13:15] <systemfault> murosai_: What was the result?
[07:13:21] <fabioportieri> try console.dir($("#folderTree"));
[07:14:20] <murosai_> Object[div#folderTree.jstree]
[07:14:38] <murosai_> that's the value of folderTree variable
[07:14:43] <fabioportieri> murosai_: console.dir to see the details..
[07:15:17] <murosai_> yup what about the details
[07:15:57] <fabioportieri> the details as in the methods/properties of the object
[07:16:12] <murosai_> anyway seems like folderTree == $("folderTree")
[07:16:26] <murosai_> $("#folderTree") that is
[07:36:35] <bloke> Hi I am building a listview with JQM 1.4.2 and would like to have anchors within the list items - is it possible to have these without triggering wrapping with ui-btn and adding the right carat icon?
[07:37:09] <fabioportieri> ggh,, nothing worse than asking help on irc and having to deal with arrogant douches
[07:37:52] <Ownix_> My google foo isnt strong today
[07:38:03] <Ownix_> I have this code, and I simply want to wrap it in <thead> tags
[07:38:06] <Ownix_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/bhMDtP8S
[07:39:26] <Ownix_> I tried this: https://pastee.org/ctbnm but it ends up spitting out this https://pastee.org/jzpzj
[07:40:23] <dwarder> in handlebars i use {{#each this}}  {{/each}} and in the same  block i use the same {{#each this}}  {{/each}}    i.e. i want to iterate twice, should it work ok?
[07:42:16] <xec> dwarder: i don't see why not. that said, does it have anything to do with jquery? :)
[07:42:46] <Ownix_> Ownix_:  do this:             $('.addthead').wrap("<thead></thead>");
[07:42:49] <Ownix_> Thanks!
[07:43:32] <Cork> uh xec wouldn't that make thead a child of tbody?
[07:44:15] <dwarder> xec: thank, it is working now, i use it with jquery ;)
[07:44:20] <xec> Cork: did you mean to message Ownix_? he seems to have sorted himself out though
[07:44:35] <dwarder> xec: don't you use it with jquery? ;)
[07:44:44] <Cork> xec: he sames to have messaged him self and i'm not sure what was what there...
[07:45:20] <Cork> Ownix: anyway if .addthead is a tr in tbody you can't really use thead wrap on it
[07:45:24] <xec> Cork: but yes, i think you're right
[07:45:34] <xec> <tbody> is injected by browser if its missing
[07:45:38] <Cork> ya
[07:46:18] <xec> dwarder: no I don't use handlebars at all
[07:48:06] <rubenator> is this syntax correct for accessing nested JSON data?
[07:48:23] <rubenator> this.JSONdata.Options.Label
[07:48:45] <Cork> rubenator: might be, depends on the data structure
[07:49:01] <Cork> rubenator: also is it json or a js object?
[07:49:05] <Cork> json is a string
[07:49:14] <Cork> and it is parsed to object/array
[07:49:31] <rubenator> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/388c3f13dd28a249ddc5
[07:49:52] <Cork> that doesn't answer if it is parsed or not .)
[07:49:56] <Cork> *:)
[07:50:52] <xec> also, options is an array
[07:50:54] <rubenator> it is being parsed because I can access other entities.
[07:51:02] <xec> so Options[0].Label
[07:51:14] <rubenator> ah!
[07:51:53] <Ownix> Cork: what are my other options for that?
[07:51:56] <rubenator> so, I should probably use a FOR statement to iterate through the array
[07:52:54] <Ownix> cork you were right, the output was this:
[07:52:58] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/dZnJhBPZ
[07:53:13] <Cork> Ownix: var addthead = $('.addthead'); addthead.closet('table').append($('<thead>').append(addthead));
[07:53:23] <xec> closeSt
[07:53:25] <AlexMPS> Hey! I'm setting a variable with the background-color of a div with this: var info_bg = $('#box' + id + ':hover').css("background-color");
[07:53:30] <Cork> opps
[07:53:30] <AlexMPS> works perfectly except for the fact I have transition-duration: 0.25s; in the css
[07:53:37] <Cork> Ownix: var addthead = $('.addthead'); addthead.closest('table').append($('<thead>').append(addthead));
[07:53:43] <xec> not everything is furniture
[07:53:45] <AlexMPS> any way I can set the variable after the transition duration?
[07:53:50] <Cork> XD
[07:54:17] <Cork> Alexer: you would have to use the transisionEnd event
[07:54:26] <Cork> Alexer: or use transition-delay
[07:54:32] <Cork> (css)
[07:55:07] <AlexMPS> will try, thanks
[07:55:41] <xec> rubenator: you can do Options.forEach() if you don't care about old ie, or jquery's $.each()
[07:56:10] <rubenator> awesome, thanks xec
[07:57:01] <xec> rubenator: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach or https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ respectively
[08:01:56] <Ownix> Cork: does it matter if thead comes after tbody in HTML? DataTables is throwing an invalid table error and your code is producing HTML that looks valid to me. The only thing that is odd is thead is coming after tbody
[08:02:25] <Cork> Ownix: it doesn't matter, but your correct i did use append
[08:02:31] <Cork> should have been prepend()
[08:05:25] <gpp> In a series of consecutive divs, if one div has class A and is immediately followed by a series of consecutive sibling divs with class B, how do I find the last div with class B?
[08:06:22] <Ownix> Cork: Yeah I swapped it for that. Here is the markup your code produces, does this look like a valid table? it does to me: https://pastee.org/7muuv
[08:06:27] <rubenator> are static variables possible in JS?
[08:06:45] <Cork> Ownix: looks valid to me
[08:06:59] <BillCriswell> gpp: Hmm... maybe like $('a').nextAll('.b').last() ?
[08:07:03] <rubenator> i cant find a reliable answer via Google
[08:08:14] <BillCriswell> gpp: Er, $('.a').nextAll('.b').last()
[08:08:27] <BillCriswell> But the way you asked the question leads me to believe I didn't have to clarify that haha.
[08:08:28] <Cork> Ownix: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffiddle.jshell.net%2Ft2nXH%2Fshow%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[08:09:02] <Cork> rubenator: it is about to land
[08:09:09] <Ownix> Cork: ah /show/ thats neat
[08:09:09] <rubenator> nevermind
[08:09:12] <Cork> rubenator: harmony has static

[08:12:34] <BillCriswell> gpp: Actually looking into that now.
[08:14:18] <BillCriswell> gpp: Actually need to use nextUntil for this I think.
[08:14:52] <gpp> BillCriswell: Seems I only get the first sequence in my test.
[08:14:56] <decx> $('.a + .b + .b + .b')
[08:15:19] <decx> selects the last b in that sequence
[08:15:42] <gpp> decx: The problem is that I dont know how many Bs there are.
[08:15:52] <BillCriswell> decx: I think it's meant for any amount of bs?
[08:15:53] <BillCriswell> gpp: http://jsbin.com/peboqije/1/edit?html,js,output have to each it.

[08:16:25] <BillCriswell> xec: Ah.
[08:17:16] <BillCriswell> xec: That only gets the very last one.
[08:17:16] <BillCriswell> Same issue I ran into with nextAll
[08:17:57] <gpp> xec: Yes, ~ means they dont need to be consecutive, I think.
[08:18:27] <BillCriswell> gpp: http://jsbin.com/peboqije/2/edit This is the only way I can think of currently haha

[08:19:48] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: http://jsbin.com/peboqije/4/edit They shoudl all be red ( I think, based on what gpp wants )
[08:20:20] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: Sorry. Morl0ck ^^
[08:20:26] <Macaveli> Indeed :D
[08:21:01] <gpp> BillCriswell: Right, they should all be red. But do we need until(.c), because I might not have a c at the end..
[08:21:41] <gpp> Is there a next until not?
[08:21:43] <BillCriswell> gpp: .nextUntil(':not(.b)')
[08:21:55] <BillCriswell> lol no clue

[08:25:11] <Ownix> Cork: why did you not have to close the <thead> tag?
[08:31:18] <BillCriswell> gpp: Just understood what you meant, but the solution I provided still actually works.
[08:31:28] <BillCriswell> Nice when that happens lol
[08:32:15] <gpp> BillCriswell: Currently testing different variant of "real cases".
[08:32:30] <BillCriswell> I hate them things.
[08:35:15] <Horacsio> guys I made this: http://jsfiddle.net/Z3E8V/2/ yeah :D :D :D
[08:36:56] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: You could avoid JS entirely by styling a label element to look like a button.
[08:37:31] <Morl0ck> Horacsio: try this http://jsfiddle.net/Z3E8V/22/

[08:39:46] <Horacsio> it's just a layout issue right?
[08:39:53] <Morl0ck> Horacsio: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ trigger will "Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type."
[08:39:56] <BillCriswell> Layou issue?
[08:40:04] <drej> ew did someone really build jquery function to trigger a check event on a standard checkbox?
[08:40:06] <drej> whyyy
[08:40:59] <Horacsio> still don't get why have that button is better than have only a checkbox
[08:41:36] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: I'm not following at all.
[08:41:43] <drej> Horacsio because its easier to click on. because it describes what that checkbox does
[08:41:52] <drej> because a checkbox by itself means nothing, and why would people click on it
[08:41:55] <Horacsio> ok I got it
[08:42:01] <drej> its easier to tap as well, on a mobile device if there's text as well
[08:42:13] <drej> for accessibility reasons, people with screen readers will know what the checkbox is if you have a label associated with it
[08:42:16] <drej> it will read it out to them
[08:42:17] <drej> i could keep going
[08:42:22] <Morl0ck> but you don't need a button then, just wrap it around <label> no?
[08:42:26] <Horacsio> because that checkbox will have some instructions on its right. just that
[08:42:38] <drej> Morl0ck dont wrap inputs with a label.
[08:42:40] <drej> use for
[08:42:48] <drej> as per BillCriswell 's example
[08:43:03] <Horacsio> it's a checkbox to display a new div. just that.
[08:43:28] <BillCriswell> drej: Why wouldn't you wrap the label though? I only separated them to show how they're tied together.
[08:43:43] <Morl0ck> yeah, i was about to ask drej
[08:43:51] <drej> BillCriswell because its a bit of an anti pattern, it also gives you less hooks for styling
[08:44:09] <Horacsio> I don't need style attached :)
[08:44:09] <drej> the label has a for attribute for a reason, the fact that an input is triggered when its wrapped in a label is actually by accident
[08:44:12] <drej> not by design
[08:44:21] <Horacsio> that's why I'm using that as it is
[08:44:23] <drej> Horacsio what you need right now is not important, wahts important is to get used to doing things properly, always
[08:44:43] <drej> i have used the same html markup for forms since 2006 and never had to change it
[08:45:00] <Horacsio> ok using a checkbox just as it is, isn't the correct method?
[08:45:00] <drej> why would you want to have to think about changing it / adjusting it on a case-to-case basis
[08:45:04] <BillCriswell> drej: That seems odd.
[08:45:12] <drej> BillCriswell which part? lots about me is odd
[08:45:27] <Morl0ck> drej, theres nothing wrong with wrapping it. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11992026/is-it-better-to-wrap-the-label-tag-around-a-form-item-or-use-the-for-attribute
[08:45:40] <drej> jsut because someone said it on stackoverflow doesnt make it right
[08:45:53] <drej> especially some obscure answer with 8 points
[08:46:08] <drej> in fact the answer itself tells you exactly why you shouldnt do it
[08:46:08] <Morl0ck> doesnt make it wrong either
[08:46:10] <BillCriswell> The accident part. No other element has that same behavior.
[08:46:11] <drej> "based on layout"
[08:46:19] <drej> you should never write your markup based on how it looks
[08:46:36] <Horacsio> well I was just happy to make that work.
[08:46:50] <Morl0ck> if you wanted css to affect the checkbox inside a label, theres nothing wrong with wrapping it
[08:46:52] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: Haha, that's the important part! Keep at it.
[08:46:55] <gpp> BillCriswell: Why does this only color the last b of the last sequence? http://jsbin.com/peboqije/9/edit
[08:47:21] <drej> Morl0ck why are you so adament about it? it doesnt detract anything if he doesnt wrap it, and this way it gives him more possibilities.
[08:47:36] <BillCriswell> gpp: It skips over all the non .b's to get to the last one.
[08:47:43] <Morl0ck> I'm not telling him to use my method, I'm arguing the point with you only now
[08:48:02] <gpp> BillCriswell: So nextAll does not only pick up the consecutive ones?
[08:48:09] <BillCriswell> Right.
[08:48:15] <drej> Morl0ck the thing is, you're doing it based on how you need it to look. not based on what it means semantically or contextually.
[08:48:29] <drej> youre limiting what you can eventually do with that combination by not separating the two
[08:48:32] <Morl0ck> i understand that, obviously
[08:48:35] <BillCriswell> gpp: Which is why I switched to nextUntil. http://jsbin.com/peboqije/7/edit
[08:48:36] <drej> anyway
[08:48:41] * drej finishes beating the dead horse
[08:48:46] <fRAiLtY-> If I have a <td> element that is updated via AJAX (successfully) why would it be the case that the javascript within that <td> fails to trigger AFTER the AJAX has been completed once? The HTML before/after looks identical
[08:48:54] * Morl0ck rolls eyes
[08:49:01] <Horacsio> BillCriswell: I'm really happy you know? :D This is great. For me it was mixing an action and a function... well as far as I see it. I'm very basic :) and I feel great for that. BUT I need always to thank you guys in the channel. You are all big motivators and helpers!
[08:49:06] * BillCriswell does some dancing
[08:49:22] <gpp> BillCriswell: And it seems to pick up the very last b, even though there is nothing after it.
[08:49:23] <drej> Morl0ck its all good, brother
[08:49:25] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: No problem!
[08:49:37] <BillCriswell> gpp: The link I just sent you?
[08:49:46] <BillCriswell> Make sure you click the link I sent, the url is different.
[08:50:05] <gpp> BillCriswell: Yes. But that is what I want. You can see that the very last b is red.
[08:50:06] <Morl0ck> drew i know, i just don't get to have any discussions, I'm a lone computer guy in a building filled with civil engineers
[08:50:21] <Morl0ck> freaking auto correct drej
[08:50:42] <drej> Morl0ck we can discuss anything to your heart's content if you want :) you can always /msg me
[08:50:50] <drej> just html structure and semantics are a little OT for this channel
[08:50:53] <BillCriswell> gpp: I'm confused haha.
[08:50:53] <gpp> BillCriswell: I worried that nextUntil(':not  ') would not pick up the last b with nothing following it.
[08:51:01] <Morl0ck> drej agreed
[08:51:09] <BillCriswell> gpp: It's picking it up in the demo I sent you.
[08:51:20] <gpp> BillCriswell: Yes. So that's great. Thanks!
[08:51:27] <BillCriswell> lol ok
[08:52:09] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[08:53:43] <gpp> BillCriswell: It's a useful example, if you remove ".last()" you color all of the "group"
[08:53:47] <drej> anyone else going to jqueryTO this weekend?
[08:54:31] <Morl0ck> where is it?
[08:54:46] <drej> toronto
[08:54:48] <drej> hence the TO
[08:54:49] <drej> :)
[08:54:54] <drej> www.jqueryto.com
[08:54:59] <ankurk_> Wish I could go
[08:55:09] <ankurk_> I live not that far from Toronto
[08:55:19] <drej> if anyone is going, let me know i'll buy you a beer
[08:55:20] <Morl0ck> pretty far from me
[08:55:27] <Morl0ck> im in Florida :(
[08:55:33] <PheLe> Hi guys, I'm looking for a simple fading text slider. Any recommendation?
[08:55:35] <gpp> BillCriswell: I initially tried to do it with css only, but found that it's easier and probably more efficient to scan once with jQ and set a class which then css will "color"
[08:55:37] <drej> Morl0ck tahts a bit of a trip :)
[08:55:43] <BillCriswell> I'll be in Boston... which is close to Canada!
[08:56:15] <ankurk_> drej: you live in Toronto?
[08:56:18] <drej> yup
[08:56:26] <BillCriswell> closer*
[08:56:31] <BillCriswell> Than Philadelphia.
[08:56:46] <drej> BillCriswell that's like a hop-skip-and-a-jump away
[08:56:56] <ankurk_> drej: so are you going?
[08:57:04] <ankurk_> I want to go actually
[08:57:08] <drej> yeah i am
[08:57:14] <drej> i was going to speak as well
[08:57:20] <drej> but didnt have time to put together a presentation
[08:57:25] <BillCriswell> gpp: I'm not sure it could be pulled off with CSS with that structure.
[08:57:55] <gpp> I only managed to "color" the next after the last.
[08:57:59] <ankurk_> Wish I could get a ride from Burlington
[08:58:52] <drej> ankurk_ if you do find one, i have a $100 discount code
[08:59:24] <ankurk_> Damn, actually I don't know any one here so :(
[09:00:08] <PheLe> Hi guys, I'm looking for a simple fading text slider. Any recommendation?

[09:05:31] <Anticom> duch_kazatel it's hopeless :)
[09:05:35] <Anticom> they'll never learn
[09:06:01] <duch_kazatel> nah, they just haven't learned of the alternatives.
[09:06:15] <Anticom> duch_kazatel there's a few people i have to remind every single time
[09:06:35] <duch_kazatel> those tend to be the people i ignore ;
[09:06:36] <Anticom> duch_kazatel can you help me with jq ui?
[09:06:37] <duch_kazatel> ;)

[09:07:14] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ qiller
[09:07:14] <b-ot> qiller: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:07:18] <Anticom> duch_kazatel me knows dem IRC rulez :D
[09:07:21] <duch_kazatel> :D
[09:07:29] <fRAiLtY-> duch_kazatel:  Found 1 I missed, any thoughts on the ajax thing? http://jsfiddle.net/sZ9zh/
[09:07:47] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: http://fixee.org/paste/x5foxyx/ see it plz :D
[09:07:56] <fRAiLtY-> I'm guessing it's beucase something is bound to a dom element that doesn't exist on ajax reload, but there's nothing obvious to a js newb like me (usual click events etc)
[09:08:01] <Anticom> what the...
[09:08:20] <Anticom> fRAiLtY- what is this? :D
[09:08:27] <Anticom> writing a plugin?
[09:08:28] <duch_kazatel> fRAiLtY- which lines aren't working?
[09:08:35] <Qiller> i want scroll only the div #scroll, but its scrolling all page! haha
[09:09:01] <fRAiLtY-> duch_kazatel:  The add function seems to not work the "2nd time around" after being reloaded by ajax
[09:09:21] <fRAiLtY-> Anticom: an uploader
[09:09:26] <duch_kazatel> i feel like i'm missing apart of your code.
[09:09:27] <Morl0ck> Anticom: http://jsbin.com/biyidobe/3/edit
[09:09:42] <Morl0ck> https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#default
[09:09:52] <fRAiLtY-> So a user uploads a file, works fine, uploader refreshes as part of a div containing previews of the uploaded with newest file in, doesn't work again until page physically refreshed
[09:09:54] <Anticom> Morl0ck awesome, thank you
[09:10:15] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: missing apart of my code?
[09:10:23] <duch_kazatel> that was to fRAiLtY-
[09:10:24] <Anticom> Morl0ck i'm planning to replace the hidden inputs with checkboxes... is there any way to register an onDrop event?
[09:10:50] <duch_kazatel> Qiller what exactly is broken?
[09:10:53] <Morl0ck> Anticom: https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#default read the docs :)
[09:11:10] <duch_kazatel> Qiller - http://jsfiddle.net/P4Ft3/
[09:11:20] <fRAiLtY-> duch_kazatel:  There's a massive upload.js file but I don't think that's relevant as it works fine, normally, it's as soon as you reload the "form" with ajax
[09:11:24] <fRAiLtY-> it doesn't then work "again"
[09:11:30] <fRAiLtY-> until you physically refresh, then it's fine
[09:11:36] <Anticom> thing is, that the cb should be checked / unchecked depending on which droppable it's dropped to
[09:12:03] <duch_kazatel> fRAiLtY- the issue is i don't see where you're actually using this is the problem.  either way, problems like that generally mean you're caching something somewhere and that reference is getting broken.
[09:12:04] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: its scrolling all page but i want scroll the div #scroll only.. Sorry my english is bad, im from Brazil and i dont speak it :D
[09:12:08] <Anticom> so if i grab an element and drop it on the same droppable again, the onDrop would be toggled aswell, wouldn't it Morl0ck. And because of that i just can't toggle the cb's state
[09:12:27] <Anticom> oh i see
[09:12:30] <duch_kazatel> Qiller that's what that example seems to be doing.
[09:12:32] <Anticom> "This event is triggered when an item from a connected sortable list has been dropped into another list. The latter is the event target."
[09:12:39] <Anticom> so it doesn't trigger if it's dropped on the same list
[09:13:02] <Morl0ck> Anticom: see?!? docs are awesome  :P
[09:13:53] <Anticom> Morl0ck ur right. i usually read them aswell :P
[09:13:58] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: if i add a div, when i scroll mouse wheel all divs has been scrolled, but i want scroll the div #scroll only! any error in my code? :D
[09:14:04] <duch_kazatel> Qiller ah, the entire document is scrolling right - $('html, body').stop().animate({ is your problem.  you're binding your scroll handling to the page.  also, your css is too wide.
[09:14:19] <Anticom> i just can't wrap my head arround ui stuff.
[09:14:45] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: hmmm, can i change it to scroll #scroll only?
[09:14:58] <duch_kazatel> bind to that div and fix your css, Qiller :)
[09:15:20] <Qiller> $('#scroll').stop().animate({
[09:15:28] <Qiller> but it cant scroll =\
[09:15:38] <duch_kazatel> lines one and two.
[09:15:56] <duch_kazatel> no need to do that if you're using jquery.
[09:17:16] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: friend, can u edit jsfiddle? i understand
[09:17:46] <Qiller> http://jsfiddle.net/P4Ft3/ to scroll #scroll only =|
[09:17:55] <duch_kazatel> Qiller I am capable of it, but I have a policy against doing people's work for them :)
[09:18:29] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: hmm sir, i want work to learn about jQuery, but i rly understand it
[09:18:39] <postitnote> Hey is there a jquery sorting plugin that isn't complete garbage?
[09:18:41] <duch_kazatel> then work to learn it.
[09:18:48] <postitnote> Tried this and it's laughable http://johnny.github.io/jquery-sortable/
[09:18:52] <duch_kazatel> Qiller what aren't you understanding?
[09:18:54] <postitnote> Wondering if I really need to write my own today.
[09:19:08] <duch_kazatel> Qiller if you're lost, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[09:19:15] <duch_kazatel> try this
[09:19:46] <Qiller> has been updated: http://jsfiddle.net/P4Ft3/1/ but i cant scroll #scroll only
[09:20:01] <duch_kazatel> Qiller think about your css for a second.
[09:20:03] <postitnote> It's 2014.  There has to be a sorting plugin that isn't terrible.  Or is this a cruel joke?
[09:20:56] <Qiller> dont work.
[09:21:17] <duch_kazatel> Qiller you have your width set in a way that will never allow scrolling the way you want.
[09:21:51] <Qiller> sincerely, i have no idea. i want learn it because i dont wanna download any script to use.
[09:21:54] <duch_kazatel> Qiller and again, lines one and two.
[09:22:07] <duch_kazatel> qiller then what good is it for me to edit it?
[09:22:37] <postitnote> My how when you leave the world of jquery everything gets quality http://rubaxa.github.io/Sortable/
[09:22:41] <postitnote> thanks
[09:22:41] <Qiller> =\
[09:22:50] <AlexPortable> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[09:22:53] <AlexPortable> found this example
[09:23:06] <AlexPortable> only problem is that it turns dates into mm/dd/yyyy
[09:23:12] <AlexPortable> but i need dd/mm/yyyy, how do i do this
[09:24:34] <Qiller> ajpiano: beauty hair, can u help me? =\ haha
[09:24:45] <duch_kazatel> Qiller you're not even trying dude.
[09:24:50] <duch_kazatel> you're copy/pasting to oblivion.
[09:25:02] <mehrdad> this nutty guy
[09:25:07] <mehrdad> the manager i mean
[09:25:07] <Qiller> omg
[09:25:13] <Anticom> Morl0ck how do i get to the dom of the ui, the recieve event gets passed?
[09:25:19] <mehrdad> analyzing the shit out of everything
[09:25:23] <Anticom> $(ui.item) feels wrong
[09:25:24] <obert> paste('Cruise'); ?
[09:25:27] <mehrdad> to the point of frustration
[09:25:30] <Qiller> 4 hours trying
[09:26:04] <duch_kazatel> Qiller okay, then let's step through it - lines one and two - what are those doing?
[09:26:27] <Qiller> line on and line two (jquery, css) ?
[09:26:36] <duch_kazatel> in your javascript.
[09:26:39] <Qiller> hmm
[09:26:41] <mehrdad> he just overthinks everthing, and i fear  we can't deliver on time
[09:26:42] <Qiller> window size.
[09:26:54] <duch_kazatel> Qiller huh?
[09:27:13] <Qiller> yeah, seeing line one and line two.
[09:27:29] <Qiller> if (window.addEventListener) window.addEventListener('DOMMouseScroll', wheel, false); window.onmousewheel = document.onmousewheel = wheel;
[09:27:40] <redskydown2> Cork: thank for the hint yesterday. I was able to do what I want. work perferctly
[09:27:40] <duch_kazatel> what does that have to do with window size?
[09:27:47] <Qiller> if mousewheel on window bla bla bla
[09:27:57] <duch_kazatel> explain it.
[09:28:10] <Qiller> if i use a mousewheel on window
[09:28:17] <Qiller> active next command.
[09:28:19] <duch_kazatel> Qiller - you're binding an event listener to DOMMouseScroll on the window
[09:28:25] <Qiller> yes
[09:28:35] <Qiller> "if i use mwheel active this command { "
[09:28:38] <Qiller> ok?
[09:28:48] <duch_kazatel> if you use the mousewheel in the window
[09:28:59] <duch_kazatel> think about that - you want to scroll a specific div, not the entire window.
[09:29:02] <Qiller> hmm i set it to #scroll its work?
[09:29:09] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily.
[09:29:20] <Qiller> yaeh, ive been seted early
[09:29:24] <duch_kazatel> but that's a great place to start.  check out jquery's .on() for event bindiong.
[09:29:28] <duch_kazatel> *binding
[09:29:37] <Qiller> wait
[09:30:03] <Morl0ck> Anticom: i don't understand, you mean this? receive( event, ui )
[09:30:14] <Anticom> yep
[09:30:26] <Qiller> frind -> if ($('#scroll').addEventListener) $('#scroll').addEventListener('DOMMouseScroll', wheel, false); $('#scroll').onmousewheel = document.onmousewheel = wheel;
[09:30:27] <Qiller> its ok?
[09:30:35] <duch_kazatel> no.
[09:30:37] <Anticom> Morl0ck  recieve got an item property, but that seems to be a plain dom reference instead of a jq object
[09:30:42] <duch_kazatel> use .on() to bind events, Qiller
[09:30:44] <Qiller> =/
[09:30:50] <Anticom> Morl0ck i've tried $(ui.item) and it works... but it still feels wrong
[09:30:59] <Qiller> addEventListener to .on ?
[09:30:59] <Morl0ck> ui.sender doesn't help?
[09:31:12] <Morl0ck> oh nvm
[09:31:17] <Horacsio> Ok now I need to call a particular checkbox to make it unchecked at first when user gets in
[09:31:20] <Horacsio> I have this
[09:31:24] <Horacsio> $(':checkbox').prop('checked', function (i, value) {
[09:31:25] <obert> 'is taken' or 'were taken'?
[09:31:25] <Horacsio> 					return !value;
[09:31:26] <Horacsio> 				});
[09:31:30] <Anticom> Morl0ck whatever... it works. job done :D
[09:31:35] <duch_kazatel> Qiller did you try reading the docs for .on()?
[09:31:40] <haemly> Can anybody help with this scenario? I have a $(".classhere").click(function(){});  That works whenever I click on an element with the specific class. But if i delete all elements that have that class, and add new ones, the click event no longer works? Anybody know why, or any work arounds
[09:31:43] <Horacsio> and the checkbox class is .Oferta
[09:31:54] <duch_kazatel> haemly check out event delegation.
[09:31:54] <Qiller> sincerely, thank yout patient but i dont speak english and its very hard for me
[09:31:58] <Morl0ck> Anticom: have you tried just ui.item ?
[09:31:59] <Qiller> =\
[09:32:08] <duch_kazatel> Qiller dude, you're not even trying.
[09:32:15] <AlexPortable> hi?
[09:32:32] <Qiller> no? i only want scroll a simple div
[09:32:36] <Anticom> Morl0ck not yet
[09:32:41] <obert> div are not simple
[09:33:00] <duch_kazatel> Qiller this is way easy, but you're not even interested in learning about simple event binding.
[09:33:02] <Morl0ck> Anticom cause i think ui.item is already a jquery object
[09:33:10] <Ownix> In your projects when you use multiple plugins, scripts and stuff by others how do you keep it updated? Or is it normal practice to use the same versions for the life of the project unless a bugfix or security fix is needed?
[09:33:23] <Anticom> Morl0ck tried it... it is :)
[09:33:43] <duch_kazatel> Ownix i update when i need to.
[09:33:44] <duch_kazatel> manually.
[09:33:46] <Morl0ck> nice
[09:33:57] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: gotcha
[09:33:59] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: sir, i dont speak ur lang its very hard to me! to i learn i want see to save in my memory! :D
[09:34:34] <duch_kazatel> Qiller go read the docs for .on() and then come back and tell me what you're confused by.
[09:34:47] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: u speak, speak, speak,,, i use a translate but i understand it! i try and try and try but this scroll dont scroll #scroll div only!
[09:35:18] <duch_kazatel> Qiller I give up.
[09:35:31] <duch_kazatel> Qiller let me guess - you want an "example" to "understand" it, right?
[09:35:32] <Qiller> if i dont wanna learn about it i download a simple script and copy/past code.
[09:36:08] <Horacsio> any help?
[09:36:11] <Qiller> yes duch_kazatel i want a example to see and learn.
[09:36:19] <duch_kazatel> Qiller then you want to copy/paste.
[09:36:25] <Qiller> no sir!
[09:36:39] <Qiller> its not my website its a simple example to execute into my fullpage! its a simple example...
[09:36:55] <NoiseEee> Horacsio: you don't care about the value, why is your script mentioning it?  you want to uncheck the checkbox.
[09:36:58] <duch_kazatel> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/horz-scroll-with-mouse-wheel/ use something like this.
[09:37:09] <duch_kazatel> Qiller i'm done trying to help you.
[09:37:15] <Qiller> if i dont wanna learn i downloar jQuery MouseWheel script and it work fine, but  i join here to learn with a example,,,
[09:37:25] <Qiller> ]*download
[09:37:26] <duch_kazatel> Qiller then read the source code of the mousehweel script.
[09:37:42] <duch_kazatel> that's almost the exact same as asking me to write your code for you.
[09:37:51] <Qiller> n√£o seria mais f√°cil voc√™ tentar me ajudar colocando um exemplo?
[09:38:13] <Qiller> thank sir but i dont like charade and joke! =D
[09:38:15] <duch_kazatel> Qiller no, it wouldn't.
[09:38:40] <duch_kazatel> Qiller i'm not kidding - reading the source code of things that do what you want is something you should learn how to do.
[09:38:56] <Qiller> downloading a jQuery script, maybe have a example and i'm using it to resolve my problem
[09:39:13] <Qiller> if i see a example i execute all code
[09:39:26] <haemly> duch_kazatel: Thanks alot, exactly what I needed!
[09:39:39] <duch_kazatel> haemly of course! :D
[09:39:52] <Qiller> I did just waste my time on this chat
[09:39:55] <Horacsio> NoiseEee: I need to every time the user gets in that page with that checkbox, the checkbox should be unchecked. do I work with the value?
[09:40:03] <Qiller> but thank ur patient
[09:40:06] <duch_kazatel> Qiller no, you wasted my time.
[09:40:13] <Qiller> too

[09:40:35] <BillCriswell> I really crack myself up.
[09:40:41] <NoiseEee> Horacsio: what does 'value' have to do with anything?  $('input[type="checkbox"]').prop('checked',false)
[09:40:46] <duch_kazatel> how you doing this morning, mano?
[09:40:52] <Qiller> if u help me using a simple example ur time not wasted, but rly need say: "Read the manual"
[09:40:54] <Morl0ck> Qiller: ##jquery-br
[09:41:06] <Qiller> Morl0ck: obrigado, est√° dificil pra mim falar aqui haha
[09:41:18] <Morl0ck> chao
[09:41:18] <duch_kazatel> Qiller you'll be right back here asking for more "examples"
[09:41:21] <Horacsio> I got it from herehttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/426258/how-do-i-check-a-checkbox-with-jquery
[09:41:23] <BillCriswell> I was just wondering why we don't have different jQuery channels for different languages.
[09:41:30] <Horacsio> I think I'm getting it wrong :S
[09:41:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Gooooood
[09:41:33] <BillCriswell> You.
[09:41:36] <BillCriswell> ?

[09:44:50] <BillCriswell> There is an ancient and hallowed tradition: if you get a reply that reads ‚ÄúRTFM‚Äù, the person who sent it thinks you should have Read The Fucking Manual. He or she is almost certainly right. Go read it.
[09:44:52] <BillCriswell> I love that.
[09:45:07] <duch_kazatel> right?
[09:45:11] <Qiller> Morl0ck: sorry Pedro Estrada is a brazilian name haah
[09:45:14] <duch_kazatel> especially for something like jquery
[09:45:15] <BillCriswell> I've gotten that reply a lot, many of the most helpful answers are simply that.
[09:45:16] <obert> duch_kazatel: left
[09:45:39] <duch_kazatel> learning to use API docs is a tremendous skill.
[09:45:54] <obert> sometimes it is: some docs sucks!
[09:46:05] <duch_kazatel> jquery and mdn are fantastic resources obert.
[09:46:20] <Qiller> woooow duch_kazatel very resize, going to next step.
[09:46:22] <duch_kazatel> and if you're using with awful documentation, that often means the code is not worth your time.
[09:46:23] <obert> *some
[09:46:27] <duch_kazatel> Qiller huh?
[09:46:35] <duch_kazatel> i got rid of all your extra code.
[09:46:41] <duch_kazatel> also your css isn't going to work the way you want.
[09:47:06] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: now i get delta and use scrollLeft to animate!
[09:48:36] <duch_kazatel> Qiller http://jsfiddle.net/P4Ft3/8/
[09:48:38] <duch_kazatel> look at this.
[09:48:45] <duch_kazatel> this is a much better example.
[09:49:06] <Qiller> wait
[09:49:34] <c00kiemon5ter> hi all
[09:49:52] <Qiller> friend duch_kazatel if i use $('#scroll').stop().animate({         scrollLeft: $('#scroll').scrollLeft() - (150 * delta)         }, 500); (AFTER if(delta ....) its work to move a div?
[09:50:00] <duch_kazatel> Qiller don't past in here.
[09:50:03] <duch_kazatel> *paste
[09:50:06] <Qiller> sry
[09:50:06] <Velveeta> jesus, i'm so relieved right now..... i finally beat http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/
[09:50:06] <duch_kazatel> try it in your code.
[09:50:21] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta you are an evil bastard.  that game is so hard.
[09:50:22] <c00kiemon5ter> I have a DOM tree, and I want to select all $('section') and replace them with <div>
[09:50:22] <Velveeta> now i can get back to what my pto time was meant for.. getting some work done
[09:50:38] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/P4Ft3/9/
[09:50:40] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: that it was... http://i.imgur.com/pvvNgBu.png
[09:51:16] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I got to 1024, that last 1024 to combine them is a bitch.
[09:51:35] <BillCriswell> You know what sucks about internet games? You can't just delete them off your phone and forget about them.
[09:51:37] <c00kiemon5ter> while I could use replaceWith() this does not work as the child elements are them "ignored"
[09:51:51] <c00kiemon5ter> s/them/then
[09:51:58] <Velveeta> yeah, before i actually managed to pull it off, i had about 5 games that i'd managed to get 1024 on, the last couple of them, i had 1024, 512, 256, and 128, but not in places i could link them up
[09:52:23] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: not work... using animate 150*delta
[09:52:59] <duch_kazatel> Qiller yeah one sec.
[09:53:01] <Velveeta> c00kiemon5ter: you'll have to do something like this: $('section').each(function () { var $this = $(this); $('<div></div>').append($this.children()).replace($this); });
[09:53:05] <duch_kazatel> Qiller i saw you the first time.
[09:53:16] <duch_kazatel> Qiller I am at work so it might take me a second to help.
[09:53:38] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: all sec to you! :D sry
[09:53:52] <Velveeta> conversely, you could try to convince whoever is pushing you that markup to push it as divs vs sections, so you don't have to bastardize the dom like that... or you just live with sections since they're valid html5 anyway...
[09:54:01] <c00kiemon5ter> Velveeta, thanks, I'll try with append/replace
[09:54:16] <Velveeta> or you *could* just live with..
[09:54:22] <CarlFK> anyone have a suggestion for an image viewer similar to what amazon uses?  (mainly make it easy to zoom in on a part)
[09:54:23] <c00kiemon5ter> heh
[09:54:50] <c00kiemon5ter> Velveeta, I have an xhtml5 document that I need to convert to a valid epub2 doc
[09:55:22] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha, i'm not familiar w/ epub format.. i mean i've consumed many of them, but never had to create one
[09:55:42] <c00kiemon5ter> yeah, epub2 does not support html5 elements, sooo ...
[09:56:10] <Velveeta> now that this game no longer rules my life, i can get back to playing with firebase and doing some angular experimentation... what they do to their markup still makes me feel dirty...
[10:00:35] <duch_kazatel> Qiller so first of all, some bigger points - mousewheel events are inconsistent between browsers.  and your event binding still wasn't making sense.
[10:00:51] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: How do you experiment with it? Do you just think like "I'm going to build something" or "I'm going to get it to do this"
[10:01:38] <Velveeta> yeah just experimental building... i spend the last couple days crash-coursing it, and am spending today working w/ firebase
[10:01:41] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: and...
[10:01:50] <duch_kazatel> Qiller so that being said, check this out - http://jsfiddle.net/P4Ft3/14/
[10:01:51] <drej> i freebased a ton of drugs in the past
[10:02:19] <duch_kazatel> Qiller note that example works in firefox.
[10:02:34] <Qiller> but dont work on chrome
[10:02:50] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Nice.
[10:03:09] <Qiller> Chrome and ie dont work
[10:03:44] <duch_kazatel> Qiller right.  because the mousehweel event is inconsistent.
[10:03:59] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/P4Ft3/18/
[10:04:00] <Morl0ck> Qiller this one works in chrome http://jsfiddle.net/P4Ft3/17/
[10:04:05] <duch_kazatel> so there's your patch for IE and Chrome.
[10:04:23] <duch_kazatel> Morl0ck the issue with that is it breaks in FF.
[10:04:26] <Qiller> yes Morl0ck
[10:04:29] <Qiller> working fine
[10:04:41] <duch_kazatel> Qiller the delta info you need is different between each browser.
[10:04:42] <Qiller> learning your code
[10:04:50] <duch_kazatel> Qiller so you need to treat the events differently.
[10:05:20] <Morl0ck> duch_kazatel may i pm you?
[10:05:48] <duch_kazatel> Morl0ck about?
[10:06:19] <Qiller> dont work on internet explorer
[10:06:23] <Morl0ck> this issue
[10:06:42] <Qiller> i'm will download a jQuery plugin
[10:06:47] <duch_kazatel> Qiller wait.
[10:06:47] <Qiller> maybe it resolve my problem
[10:06:53] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/P4Ft3/20/
[10:06:53] <Qiller> k
[10:06:57] <duch_kazatel> Qiller this was easy buddy.
[10:07:08] <duch_kazatel> Morl0ck I guess.
[10:07:35] <Qiller> work fine on chrome and ie duch_kazatel
[10:07:40] <duch_kazatel> Qiller and firefox.
[10:07:41] <Morl0ck> duch_kazatel nvm :D
[10:07:45] <Qiller> GREAT
[10:07:56] <duch_kazatel> Qiller all of this info was available via google searches.
[10:07:59] <duch_kazatel> i guarantee you.
[10:08:34] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: my browser history have 100+ google searchs about it
[10:08:40] <duch_kazatel> also, you might want to add in an event.preventDefault() at the top of those handlers, or a return false; at the bottom.
[10:08:53] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/18979467/923919
[10:09:12] <duch_kazatel> Qiller .bind is deprecated, but .on() can be used in its place safely.
[10:09:37] <duch_kazatel> you should learn some basics.  it'll save you time and effort down the road.
[10:10:06] <duch_kazatel> and now to go back to my jquery plugin.
[10:10:18] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: hmm, cant i  reduce space of scroll? when i scroll it its going start to end.
[10:10:30] <duch_kazatel> Qiller ...
[10:10:36] <duch_kazatel> Qiller check your math dude
[10:10:52] <rubenator> is there something wrong with this syntax? $("<div>hello</div>");
[10:11:03] <duch_kazatel> rubenator nope.  that's a document fragment.  looks righty to me.
[10:11:11] <rubenator> thought so
[10:12:21] <duch_kazatel> Qiller again, each browser handles scrolling differently - so the delta info will be different between all of them./
[10:12:33] <Qiller> hmm
[10:12:38] <Qiller> ok duch_kazatel
[10:12:40] <Qiller> thak all
[10:12:42] <duch_kazatel> what would you try in this case?
[10:13:07] <duch_kazatel> hint - lines 16 and 20 are your problem.
[10:22:01] <afrance> How do I convert this: http://jsfiddle.net/8CM4d/ so that its delegated and works on additional elements loaded after ready?
[10:23:20] <NoiseEee> you'd have to check with the lazy library really
[10:23:37] <NoiseEee> afrance: my guess is that you're going to have to re-init each time
[10:24:01] <NoiseEee> (... you add an image)
[10:24:40] <hellothere> hey there anyone knows of any modal that works on mobile like alert or something like that?
[10:26:33] <afrance> hmm, was hoping i could do something more like this:  jQuery("body").find('img.lazy').on('load', lazy())  but when I do the browser doesn't seem to have any idea of what lazy() is.
[10:28:07] <duch_kazatel> afrance which lazy loader are you using?
[10:28:16] <afrance> unveil
[10:28:57] <duch_kazatel> unveil() is the method name for that one, isn't it?
[10:29:06] <afrance> http://luis-almeida.github.io/unveil/
[10:29:24] <afrance> yeah, this works: $("img.unveil").unveil();
[10:29:35] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/luis-almeida/unveil/ - I was reading here
[10:30:11] <afrance> but only on content there when the document is ready, content loaded later doesn't  (really common problem)
[10:30:12] <duch_kazatel> are you looking to bind to the event that fires when they're unveiled?
[10:30:25] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/p6w9t/  i want that only after all getidshistorico() ids in "sucess" are set, only then it calls listarHistorico() in callback. But i can't do that. it shows an error "callback() its not a function". Even though it runs all ajax calls in listarHistorico() but not after getidshistorico() is complete
[10:30:25] <duch_kazatel> because the event is named unveil
[10:30:30] <afrance> no, I just need the images loaded in content later on to unveil
[10:30:54] <duch_kazatel> $("img").trigger("unveil");
[10:31:33] <duch_kazatel> xnotte you want getidshistorico(i,listarHistorico);
[10:31:35] <duch_kazatel> drop the parens
[10:33:58] <afrance> yeah, but isn't trigger('unveil') used to force the unveil?  I don't want all the images in the newly loaded content to unveil, I still need them to lazy load on the newly loaded content.
[10:35:12] <minty2> i know im not supposed to paste code butttttttt its really short :)
[10:35:22] <duch_kazatel> minty2 if it's more than one line, don't paste it.
[10:35:27] <minty2> if ($(".internalTable:contains(" + newName + ")").length){ //Do stuff }
[10:35:30] <duch_kazatel> afrance aaah, you're having an issue with dynamically loaded content.
[10:35:58] <duch_kazatel> afrance hrm.  not sure.  you might have you reinitialize.
[10:36:15] <minty2> if i log that .length  it should return how many occurrences of newName are in my table.internalTable  .... right?
[10:36:49] <minty2> or even:
[10:36:49] <minty2> console.log($(".internalTable > tr > td."+newName).length);
[10:36:50] <BillCriswell> minty2: No.
[10:36:57] <minty2> dangit!
[10:37:06] <BillCriswell> minty2: Your second one can do that.
[10:37:08] <duch_kazatel> it'll find all .internalTable's that contain your string.
[10:37:28] <minty2> let me try that
[10:37:44] <BillCriswell> $('.internalTable td:contains(' + newName + ')')
[10:38:02] <BillCriswell> The tr is needlessly specific.
[10:38:39] <xnotte> duch_kazatel: many thanks
[10:38:44] * systemfault vomits on :contains
[10:38:46] <xnotte> it works now
[10:38:55] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Haha, agreed.
[10:39:03] <duch_kazatel> xnotte my pleasuire
[10:39:12] <duch_kazatel> minty2 i would suggest not using contains.
[10:39:12] <minty2> whats wrong with :contains?
[10:39:20] <duch_kazatel> it's slow.
[10:39:46] <systemfault> Not just that.
[10:39:54] <duch_kazatel> it'sa also ugly imo.
[10:40:50] <fons1> Hello. I'm working on a contact form script which I need to modify to get it working on  a submit handler. I need to get the success portion of the ajax script (line 49-54) to do the same action the way the original script functioned. Code is commented out. "Original Javascript File" and "Submit Handler". Code here: http://jsfiddle.net/gPC27/
[10:42:36] <Horacsio> why $('.Oferta').prop('checked', false); isn't enough to make my checkbox unchecked?
[10:42:54] <minty2> BillCriswell: so im logging the $(".internalTable > tr > td."+newName).length   and its still only returning 0
[10:43:13] <minty2> even if there are 3 of the same td.newName
[10:43:36] <afrance> duch: hmm. Should probably just try it but, are you suggesting I just add a callback on the completion of the ajax call that simply does $("img.lazy").unveil() again?
[10:43:36] <m1chael> im trying to use jquery mobile, with themeroller, and i'm having trouble seeing icons. does anyone have any suggestions for me?
[10:44:53] <djarico> d
[10:45:12] <Guest66614> hi all
[10:45:39] <Guest66614> anyone good with the sortable UI?
[10:47:01] <Guest66614> fancy a fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/zty72/
[10:47:19] <duch_kazatel> afrance that might make sense.
[10:47:21] <afrance> Duch, that worked... thanks for the help!
[10:47:26] <duch_kazatel> of course hahahhaa
[10:48:59] <minty2> okay guys so whats a good alternative to :contains
[10:49:07] <minty2> to search a table for a variable string
[10:49:25] <duch_kazatel> minty2 why not tell us why you need to find that td?
[10:49:45] <duch_kazatel> like, why can't you output that TD with a special class?
[10:49:50] <duch_kazatel> or ID
[10:50:35] <minty2> duch_kazatel: i populate a number of tables from ajax call.... then each of those tables have a button to reconcile (each table does different functions with a spreadsheet)
[10:51:05] <minty2> i want to count the number of same occurrences within those tables
[10:51:48] <duch_kazatel> minty2 i would find a way to do that outside of using a jquery selector.
[10:52:32] <minty2> duch_kazatel: im open to ideas! lol
[10:52:53] <duch_kazatel> minty2 how are you spitting that data out to your frontend?  JSON?
[10:53:00] <minty2> xml
[10:53:06] <minty2> i wish json :/
[10:53:23] <duch_kazatel> mmk, so is there any way to update your backend to output that data for you?
[10:53:44] <minty2> pulling from a cors end point
[10:53:55] <minty2> and the data it pulls is always different
[10:54:01] <minty2> once i pull it i cant pull it again
[10:54:06] <duch_kazatel> so you are not in control of the endpoint?
[10:54:12] <minty2> nope
[10:54:26] <duch_kazatel> okay.  hrm.  any way you could scrub that data before rendering?
[10:54:36] <minty2> i do that
[10:54:37] <duch_kazatel> the problem is accessing the DOM is slow and expensive as-is.
[10:54:43] <minty2> thats how i populate the tables
[10:54:59] <duch_kazatel> then get your data during that.
[10:55:21] <minty2> a series of if statements send the required values to the designated table
[10:55:27] <m1chael> http://infobuzz.me/static/css/test.html # i'm using jquery mobile with a custom themeroller. i do not see my icons. when i load the default jquery/css the icons work. i've run this page through chrome developer tools, and the icons aren't being loaded at all with my custom theme. does anyone know anything about this?
[10:55:37] <BillCriswell> I think it's hard to work with mostly. I hate string concatenation.
[10:55:37] <BillCriswell> $('.internalTable td').filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML.indexOf(newName) > -1 }).length is an alternative.
[10:55:37] <systemfault> It's plainly wrong as your code now depends on the content of the document instead of its structure.
[10:56:18] <duch_kazatel> minty2 then yeah, run your checks in there.  do it outside of the dom and populate a var somewhere.
[10:56:23] <duch_kazatel> that's likely your best bet.
[10:56:25] <BillCriswell> $('.internalTable td').filter(function(){ return ( this.innerText || this.textContent ).indexOf(newName) > -1 }).length might be a little safer.
[10:56:33] <duch_kazatel> or do what BillCriswell is suggesting.
[10:56:48] <minty2> im going to try what BillCriswell said first
[10:56:52] <minty2> thanks everyone
[10:56:57] <minty2> ill be back...
[10:56:58] <minty2> im sure.
[10:56:59] <minty2> ll
[10:57:00] <duch_kazatel> haha
[10:57:20] <BillCriswell> minty2: Is newName supposed to be a class name?
[10:57:25] <BillCriswell> minty2: http://jsbin.com/cegubutu/1/edit?js,output
[10:57:27] <minty2> its a var
[10:57:28] <BillCriswell> I love Yuck.
[10:57:28] <BillCriswell> It's too late. I retract my link.
[10:57:29] <BillCriswell> minty2: You saw this link right? http://jsbin.com/cegubutu/1/edit?js,output
[10:57:51] <minty2> newName is a subString of an XML value
[10:58:00] <BillCriswell> It's still a string.
[10:58:16] <minty2> agreed
[10:58:20] <BillCriswell> Right? Am I thinking about that right?
[10:58:24] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[10:58:53] <Guest66614> anyone know why my attemp to use sortable lists contained in different tabs would do some crazy stuff to the "over" event? as in - it doesnt fire when you expect...?
[10:59:33] <minty2> BillCriswell: IT WORKS!
[10:59:36] <minty2> :)))))
[10:59:47] <BillCriswell> Damn, could you imagine how much more complex websites would be if someone had three arms to accomplish that task Guest66614?
[10:59:54] <BillCriswell> minty2: Sweet.
[10:59:55] <Horacsio> if checkbox is checked then uncheck it
[10:59:59] <Horacsio> how to?
[11:00:15] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: .prop('checked', false)
[11:01:25] <Guest66614> @BillCriswell, maybe its just the way i am decribing it hehe
[11:01:43] <duch_kazatel> Guest66614 did you supply a code example?
[11:01:52] <Guest66614> code in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zty72/
[11:02:14] <BillCriswell> Guest66614: I read it wrong now that I reread it.
[11:03:32] <Guest66614> if you drag something over the tabs on the left it actiavtes the next "page" but to drop it inside that sortable list you have to drag it further to the right by about half way...
[11:03:59] <Guest66614> other than that it all works fine... lol
[11:08:54] <laszlokorte> Hi, is it possible to use own event listeners for jqueryUI draggable? I want to make an element draggable but it already have an own mousedown listener bound to this element in which I want to start the drag-interaction instead of relying on the jqueryUI-draggable-module binding it's own mousedown listener.
[11:10:03] <BillCriswell> Guest66614: This sure is finicky.... if that's even close how to spell that.
[11:11:46] <Guest66614> BillCriswell, yeah it is huh... i spose it must have something to do with the mouse movements not being detected as the hidden list becomes visible?
[11:12:25] <fiveofoh> Guest66614: Huh, that is odd...my guess would be something to do with the page being hidden when things are getting set up, but that's just a stab in the dark
[11:12:33] <Horacsio> can someone correct my script: http://jsfiddle.net/
[11:12:44] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/Z2kDg/
[11:12:47] <BillCriswell> Guest66614: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-refreshPositions mayhaps?
[11:12:50] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio hit "save" and then paste that link.
[11:12:58] <Horacsio> done
[11:12:59] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/Z2kDg/
[11:13:30] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you're missing a paren
[11:13:32] <duch_kazatel> line 7
[11:14:39] <Guest66614> BillCriswell: i tried the refreshpositions as $('.page').sortable('refreshPositions') activated by the "over" event on the droppable items - but it didnt seem to work
[11:14:58] <duch_kazatel> also, your code makes no sense.  if it's check, do some other stuff.  if it's anything other than checked, uncheck it.
[11:15:22] <duch_kazatel> *if it's checked
[11:19:12] <Guest66614> fiveofoh: i have tried having all pages "visible" when the page loads
[11:20:19] <jeremyabel> Hi!  Code: http://paste.pm/ekf.js So, I'm trying to do a really simple ajax request here, and the request itself is working fine, but the success function is unable to access the boroughs variable
[11:20:30] <jeremyabel> I've never really done this before so it's not clear to me why that's happening. Seems like it's not in the right scope, but I'm not sure how to put it in the right scope
[11:22:17] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel boroughs is in a parent scope, so you're fine there.  what's the error you're getting?
[11:22:29] <jeremyabel> it reads as "undefined"
[11:22:39] <Horacsio> I have this $( ':checkbox' ).prop('checked', false); but instead of pointing to :checkbox I would like to point to its class .Oferta how to?
[11:23:03] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel first of all, running an interval and then iterating and then firing an ajax request is a bad idea.
[11:23:10] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio huh?
[11:23:20] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you want to uncheck .Oferta?
[11:23:25] <Horacsio> yes
[11:23:31] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: yeah I figured it might be, but I've never really done JS before so I'm pretty unaware of best practices :P
[11:23:35] <duch_kazatel> ... really?  what did you try, Horacsio
[11:23:48] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: above that code is "// Sorry this is probably really dumb"
[11:23:48] <Horacsio> $( ':checkbox' ).prop('checked', false);
[11:23:53] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel what are you actually trying to do?
[11:24:08] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio right, how would you target a class, instead of :checkbox
[11:24:11] <Horacsio> this is to reset the checkbox .Oferta
[11:24:21] <Horacsio> I don't know! :(
[11:24:22] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: every 5 seconds I want to query twitter for the number of tweets containing 5 different hash tags
[11:24:36] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio $( ':checkbox' ) is the selector.
[11:24:47] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: every 10 seconds, rather. 5 seconds would overrun the 450 queries per 15 minutes limit
[11:25:03] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel okay, so first of all, you need to abstract things out a little differently.
[11:25:28] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: Go on. FWIW this is just a quick prototype and won't ever be production code :P
[11:25:28] <Ownix> How do I "continue;" in a .each(function (i) {});
[11:25:37] <guide_X> whats the best way to handle disabled checkbox onclick
[11:25:40] <Horacsio> I know that. but I want to refer $( ':checkbox' ).prop('checked', false); to the class... is it possible? otherwise it uncheck all checkboxes :D
[11:25:57] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio holy shit dude.  $( '.classnamehere' ).prop('checked', false);
[11:26:30] <Horacsio> well I tried that :D $( '.Oferta' ).prop('checked', false); it doesn't work!
[11:26:40] <BillCriswell> Guest66614: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2131712/jquery-drag-element-into-sortable-list-that-has-initial-state-as-hidden ?
[11:26:40] <duch_kazatel> then that class isn't on the input.
[11:27:33] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel you should only run the next iteration when the previous ajax call completes.
[11:27:38] <duch_kazatel> i'd look at ways to control that.
[11:27:51] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: yeah I figured that'd be a good idea but I have no idea how to do it :P
[11:28:01] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: if this were C# I'd be all set ;)
[11:28:03] <duch_kazatel> check out using promises instead.
[11:28:07] <jeremyabel> ok
[11:28:27] <duch_kazatel> you'll still make calls to the api using ajax, but things will resolve much more reliably.
[11:28:30] <jeremyabel> but regardless of waiting and stuff, let's say I was just doing one iteration, checking one hashtag
[11:28:31] <Horacsio> and about the checkbox name?
[11:28:42] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio what is the class on the checkbox?
[11:28:56] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel you still want to use promises.
[11:29:08] <duch_kazatel> because you're firing a bunch of ajax requests at once.
[11:29:12] <duch_kazatel> that gets hairy.
[11:29:15] <Horacsio> .Oferta
[11:29:24] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio i don't believe you.  fiddle it?
[11:30:04] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel what specific error were you getting in the console before?
[11:30:17] <jeremyabel> it wasn't an "error" per se
[11:30:27] <duch_kazatel> huh?  what was it, then?
[11:30:29] <jeremyabel> the console logged out "undefined: [number]"
[11:30:39] <jeremyabel> instead of "Manhattan: [number]"
[11:30:45] <jeremyabel> "Brooklyn: [number]"
[11:30:50] <jeremyabel> etc
[11:31:12] <fiveofoh> BillCriswell: Eh, none of those seem to work either.  Looking through the actual jQuery code, seems to be an issue of the currentContainer not getting switched?  Not sure.
[11:31:43] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: doing just console.log( boroughs ); in that success function also gave "undefined"
[11:32:19] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel try putting your var declatarions inside that setinterval
[11:32:21] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:32:27] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: tried that, no change
[11:33:03] <Guest66614> BillCriswell: just tried adding a "refresh" as per the stackoverflow suggestion... added it to the menu change so that it would refresh the newly active list... didnt work :(
[11:33:39] <BillCriswell> jeremyabel: Look at the Network Panel and see the requests that are being made.
[11:35:05] <duch_kazatel> back
[11:35:10] <jeremyabel> hold on, console is reporting some jquery missing a ; error...
[11:35:27] <jeremyabel> unexpected token ; rather
[11:35:47] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel ah, remove it after the uri: option
[11:36:16] <duch_kazatel> object properties never use semicolons after them.  only commas, and only after all but the last one.
[11:36:21] <jeremyabel> ah, ok
[11:36:54] <jeremyabel> anyway, the Network Panel reports the queries are being made correctly
[11:37:08] <duch_kazatel> what are the URLs it is hitting
[11:37:12] <BillCriswell> jeremyabel: Another thing to be careful about, you shouldn't be creating functions inside loops.
[11:37:28] <jeremyabel> http://localhost:9888/php/search_response.php?q=%23Manhattan etcetera
[11:37:38] <jeremyabel> for each item in the array
[11:37:55] <duch_kazatel> which version of jquery?
[11:38:11] <jeremyabel> 1.11.0 it seems
[11:38:15] <jeremyabel> which uh
[11:38:16] <jeremyabel> is old
[11:38:18] <jeremyabel> uhhhh
[11:38:22] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[11:38:25] <duch_kazatel> that's actually current.
[11:38:27] <jeremyabel> oh
[11:38:35] <jeremyabel> oh it said copyright 2005, 2014
[11:38:39] <jeremyabel> I read copyright 2005, 2004 :P
[11:38:52] <jeremyabel> so yeah, that version.
[11:38:53] <duch_kazatel> there are two "series" - 2.x and 1.x - the 2 series drops support for old browsers.  the 1 series keeps them.
[11:38:57] <clime> duch_kazatel:  have you ever met an issue when a webkit browser (chrome) refuses to repaint screen after dom changes?
[11:39:08] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: ah
[11:39:12] <duch_kazatel> clime only when the document is invalid.
[11:39:55] <clime> duch_kazatel: that is when it does not validate in some w3c validator<
[11:40:03] <clime> ?
[11:40:37] <duch_kazatel> jeremyabel if boroughs is available within the .ajax call, then it's not a scopign problem.  hrm.  maybe try to console.log the entire boroughs object within the top of success?
[11:40:48] <duch_kazatel> clime sorta, yeah.
[11:41:16] <duch_kazatel> clime usually only for really big problems though, like duplicated doctype or extra opening body tags or whatever
[11:42:01] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: "undefined"
[11:42:07] <jeremyabel> 5 times
[11:42:23] <clime> duch_kazatel: ye hmm I dont have that, I think. I know that my problem was related to google map displayed on the screen. When I removed it, repaint occured. When it was there, it didn't work correctly
[11:42:24] <duch_kazatel> that makes absolutely no sense.
[11:42:30] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: yeah....
[11:42:42] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: shall I jsfiddle it?
[11:42:55] <duch_kazatel> that'd be nice.
[11:43:05] <jeremyabel> k one sec
[11:43:06] <drej> no dont, we love guessing
[11:43:07] <clime> duch_kazatel: I solved it by inserting empty div into the element that I have been manipulating with. Quite strange but couldn't find anything better. Ok thx
[11:44:04] <Guest66614> i think i know what is happening.... if you notice you have to drag the item about the same distance into the container as there is on the left...
[11:44:35] <Guest66614> is it possible that the offsets are being reset or something when switching sortable lists?
[11:45:46] <bricker> Hello, I'm testing a jquery request from one server on localhost to another server on localhost, but I need to test that CORS works properly but jquery isn't sending the Origin header, I guess because it sees it's going to the "same" server. Is there a way around this? I see jQuery.ajax's crossDomain option, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.
[11:48:59] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: guh I have no idea how to use their ajax fakery thing
[11:49:14] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/PdHK2/ is as far as I manged :P
[11:49:29] <Neobenedict> hi, my code works fine with firebug, but doesn't work at all when I embed it in the page with an external link. what am I msissing? http://pastebin.com/JVRDtAqv code
[11:53:45] <Fishy> if i wanted to grab all the styles on an element so i can reapply them.. how would i do that?
[11:54:16] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: I got it!
[11:54:30] <jeremyabel> duch_kazatel: the onSuccess is async, so "i" doesn't exist when it actually runs
[11:54:36] <jeremyabel> the i from the for loop
[11:54:44] <jeremyabel> effing async...
[11:55:01] <jeremyabel> which is why the queries are correct but the trace isn't
[11:55:28] <BillCriswell> jeremyabel: I told you, no functions in loops. =)
[11:55:40] <jeremyabel> BillCriswell: what's the better solution?
[11:55:57] <jeremyabel> (this is literally the first javascript thing I've ever written :P)
[11:58:15] <BillCriswell> jeremyabel: I'd build an array of promoises, then when they're all resolved I'd call the function to do the same thing again after 5 seconds.
[11:58:29] <jeremyabel> cool
[11:58:44] <clime> duch_kazatel: i have checked the pages with validator and I have got no serious mistakes (like missing closing tags) in there
[11:58:55] <jeremyabel> thanks duch_kazatel + BillCriswell!
[11:59:01] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[11:59:32] <jeremyabel> off I go into the lovely land of "shit guys we need this prototype by Friday morning!" "I don't know js but I'll figure it out"
[11:59:57] <clime> duch kazatel: in fact there are like three errors when I copy the source code (there are more errors if I copy the html from dom inspector after js is applied to it but still I have found nothing serious).
[12:00:28] <BillCriswell> jeremyabel: Well if you need any help we're like.. always here.
[12:00:41] <hlvwrk> HI BILL :)
[12:01:10] <BillCriswell> hlvwrk: Ayyy
[12:03:52] <BillCriswell> jeremyabel: http://pastie.org/pastes/8916647/text something along the lines of this, hacked it up real quick so it might not work without some love.
[12:04:48] <Neobenedict> can anyone answer my question?
[12:05:32] <BillCriswell> Neobenedict: Where are you adding the extranl script?
[12:05:40] <BillCriswell> <head>? before </body>?
[12:05:51] <Neobenedict> yes.
[12:05:54] <drej> most heads come before body
[12:06:02] <BillCriswell> .... that was an or question.
[12:06:20] <BillCriswell> drej: If you walk on you feet like a woman.
[12:06:23] <drej> BillCriswell yes.
[12:06:24] <Neobenedict> yes.
[12:06:27] <drej> lol
[12:06:35] <Neobenedict> just kidding. between the head tags
[12:06:47] <BillCriswell> Neobenedict: You need to put it in a document ready call.
[12:07:03] <Neobenedict> can I do this in the same external script?
[12:07:09] <Neobenedict> the way this works is... complicated
[12:07:13] <BillCriswell> Neobenedict: So wrap it with like (function($){ /* Your Code */ });
[12:07:41] <BillCriswell> or $(document).ready(function(){ /* Your Code */ });
[12:07:49] <Neobenedict> wrap it with (function($) { ?
[12:07:59] <Neobenedict> that makes sense, considering everything else is like that
[12:07:59] <Neobenedict> heh
[12:08:04] <Neobenedict> cheers.
[12:08:24] <Neobenedict> these ones have }(jQuery)); at the end
[12:08:40] <BillCriswell> That's not quite the same thing.
[12:08:43] <Neobenedict> (function($) { ... }(jQuery));
[12:08:47] <Neobenedict> what's that then?
[12:09:08] <Guest24270> hey all - anyone good with regexes? i want to exclude every numerical instance of do.thedailyburn.com, do1.thedailyburn, do2, do3, etc. This is what I have:     !/do\d*\thedailyburn.com/.test('do.thedailyburn.com')
[12:09:33] <BillCriswell> Neobenedict: That's an IIEF.. or IIFE, I always fuck that up.
[12:09:47] <systemfault> IIFE
[12:09:52] <BillCriswell> Neobenedict: http://pastie.org/pastes/8916667/text this should work, the way you have yours currently would work if you places it right before the </body>
[12:09:53] <Neobenedict> "Immediately-invoked function expression"
[12:10:03] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that jawn.
[12:10:06] <Neobenedict> man I don't understand half these terms
[12:10:23] <BillCriswell> Neobenedict: It's just a function that's called automatically.
[12:10:32] <Neobenedict> i see
[12:10:35] <Neobenedict> I only really started with jquery yesterday
[12:10:46] <Neobenedict> so excuse these obvious questions
[12:11:15] <Neobenedict> what is the non- (jQuery) called? if not IIFE
[12:11:36] <BillCriswell> (function(jquerydawg, name){ console.log( jquerydawg, name ); })(jQuery, 'Bill'); so in there you can use jQuery as jquerydawg
[12:12:07] <BillCriswell> jquerydawg('a').css('color', 'blue') and so on.
[12:13:00] <Neobenedict> i see.
[12:13:15] <Neobenedict> would the (function($) { ... }(jQuery)); work as well with my code?
[12:14:04] <Neobenedict> \o/ things are now working
[12:14:07] <Neobenedict> thank you.
[12:15:18] <BillCriswell> jQuery needs to exist before you can use it, so as long as it's after you include jQuery yes.
[12:15:24] <BillCriswell> Neobenedict: No problem.
[12:16:19] <Neobenedict> onto the server-side check
[12:16:26] <Neobenedict> which isn't jQuery, sadly
[12:18:38] <farn5w0rth> what's the loading circle dealy called in bootstrap
[12:20:04] <Eofam> Hey, got a quick question about ajax method
[12:21:14] <Eofam> my ajax loads the data properly, but doesn't not display when you append it. I mean it does display once an alert is issued before the said append, it also displays if I log the data to console. However if it is logged to console and not alerted, or not logged and not alerted it doesn't display, doesn't append at all.
[12:21:47] <shoky> paste your code somewhere
[12:21:53] <Eofam> Question is, whether could it be my local host? Or do I need to give ajax a bit more time to retrieve data?
[12:21:55] <Eofam> sure, moment
[12:22:04] <Eofam> I'll put the whole JS file just in case, it's not huge
[12:22:47] <Eofam> http://pastebin.com/0MdH0Qk4
[12:23:01] <Eofam> Don't mind any lose ends, those I'm cleaning up, and yes, I checked, they are not at fault here.
[12:24:06] <Eofam> even when I disable the rest of the functions and code, the ajax doesn't display data unless alert is issued
[12:27:12] <shoky> you're sure the new data is not in the DOM? maybe it's just not visible
[12:27:29] <Eofam> I'm sure, inspected the element, it's not there at all.
[12:27:39] <shoky> not sure what yer doing with that delay and calling regionHandle, for each .book-layer
[12:28:04] <Eofam> it didn't execute unless there was a delay on it. setTimeout didn't work either for some reason.
[12:28:13] <Eofam> if I have the alert and remove the delay it runs fine now
[12:28:23] <Eofam> it's just a bit of redundant code that's left
[12:28:34] <Eofam> which I tried removing, but doesn't do anything
[12:28:36] <shoky> if $($innerCon)  returns more than one element (and im guessing it does..)  then it'll run your queue callback for EACH of those
[12:28:55] <Eofam> hmm
[12:29:17] <shoky> setTimeout(function() { regionHandle($innerCon, 1, position); }, 100);
[12:29:33] <joel000> hey
[12:29:35] <shoky> what's the delay for, anyway
[12:29:50] <Eofam> aye, well I've done that in the past, it didn't work, but even with all that code out of the success function, it still doesn't display until alert is issued
[12:30:09] <Eofam> the delay was for the appended data to be processed, without the delay it didn't run the function
[12:30:12] <joel000> hey guyz
[12:30:14] <Eofam> now it does, once the alert is issued
[12:30:15] <joel000> I need to detect when an element is going out of its parent
[12:30:25] <joel000> so that I'm able to change its class and make it look different.
[12:30:32] <joel000> any idea??
[12:30:34] <Eofam> you mean when it's outside of the set height?
[12:30:38] <shoky> Eofam, not making much sense.. any chance you can put this online
[12:30:47] <Eofam> kinda sorta, give me a moment
[12:30:48] <joel000> no, when it goes outside of its parent, Eofam
[12:31:01] <joel000> aka overflow
[12:31:59] <Eofam> do height check of parent element, height check of all elements in the parent element, see which one adds to the total height. if total height + last element > parent height, then you've got your culprit
[12:32:05] <Eofam> but albeit I don't make much sense these days
[12:32:43] <Eofam> shoky, nevermind that. Runs fine now, it seems there was a problem with my localhost
[12:33:50] <ankurk_> I question my logic sometimes
[12:34:28] <shoky> logical thing to do
[12:34:42] <Eofam> I do that constantly, and I am so please when my code runs the first time I test it
[12:34:46] <Eofam> rare are those occasions
[12:35:22] <ankurk_> but still I think I am stupid sometimes
[12:35:33] <joel000> i'm asking myself why the Css w3c guys didn;t think of a pseudoclass :overflown
[12:36:15] <Eofam> I question why didn't they think of a lot of stuff
[12:36:24] <MachineX> If anyone is interested, InformIT publishing have a deal (today only). The book: 'JQuery, JQuery UI, and JQuery Mobile' is $12.99, down from $31.99.
[12:37:04] <MachineX> http://www.informit.com/deals
[12:37:15] <joel000> SPAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMm
[12:37:37] <joel000> The internet is full of Free guides to both Javascript and jQuery
[12:37:45] <joel000> why should I pay for it? :P
[12:38:16] <Eofam> joel000, just run a loop. set parentHeight = $parent .height(); elementHeight = $child.height(); totalHeight = totalHeight + elementHeight + any margins; if total height at some point in the loop exceeds parent height, then do something with that element which was the last to exceed the parent height
[12:38:17] <MachineX> because then you wouldn't be stealing?
[12:38:24] <duch_kazatel> MachineX uh, what?
[12:38:33] <duch_kazatel> MachineX there are lots of free guides out there that are free on purpose.
[12:38:44] <Eofam> because reading an actual books is so much better when it comes to comprehension, as opposed reading it on a screen
[12:38:46] <Eofam> at least for me
[12:38:54] <MachineX> Great. I hope you're very happy with your free guides.
[12:39:12] <Eofam> guides are one thing, but knowing the basis behind jQuery is another
[12:39:18] <duch_kazatel> yeah, like the API documentation.
[12:39:22] <Eofam> it's kind of like learning C++, and then learning assembly
[12:39:34] <systemfault> o_O
[12:39:37] <duch_kazatel> wut.
[12:39:41] <systemfault> How is C++ related to assembly?
[12:39:54] <systemfault> You can be a genius C++ programmer and know fuck all about ASM.
[12:39:55] <drej> carefully
[12:40:20] <Eofam> ASM lets you understand the inner workings behind the actual language
[12:40:24] <Eofam> at least did for me back in the day
[12:40:50] <joel000> LoL
[12:41:06] <joel000> We have a couple of book publishers hanging around freenode trying to make money
[12:41:08] <duch_kazatel> yeah so really you need to learn jquery, then javascript, then C, then ASM.
[12:41:12] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, what's the point.
[12:41:20] <MachineX> I'm not a book publisher.
[12:41:21] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[12:41:23] <Eofam> not saying that, just saying it was worthwhile for me
[12:41:26] <joel000> not publisher, seller
[12:41:37] <duch_kazatel> MachineX it comes off that you were.
[12:41:38] <joel000> marketing sellers
[12:41:45] <MachineX> I'm not selling anything.
[12:41:53] <Eofam> But I suppose subjective if not as cool as objective, people tend to mix those up a lot of the time.
[12:42:41] <joel000> you're trying to increase the sellings of those publishers.
[12:42:42] <duch_kazatel> MachineX it looked like you were trying to make a few bucks - we get spammers in here constantly.
[12:43:12] <systemfault> Anyway.... books about jQuery are outdated the day of their release...Don't buy them
[12:43:30] <joel000> claiming that free books are not good you essentially prove whose intrests you're fighting here
[12:44:03] <joel000> s/fighting/making
[12:44:18] <duch_kazatel> and assuming that anybody suggesting free books is stealing them is a little off.
[12:44:29] <joel000> ^ ^
[12:44:30] <MachineX> Wow, creepy chat room.
[12:44:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:44:39] <joel000> lol
[12:44:58] <joel000> Mr buy my books is sad, he won;t have revenue for tonight
[12:45:38] <duch_kazatel> i don't know that he was standing to make any money off of it - he didn't paste an affiliate link/
[12:45:43] <duch_kazatel> but it's still bad practice.
[12:46:05] <joel000> he did paste a link.
[12:46:53] <BillCriswell> Creepy?
[12:47:25] <Ghoul> Booooooooo
[12:47:27] <duch_kazatel> sure, but that doesn't mean he stands to make any money.
[12:47:29] <duch_kazatel> AAAAAH
[12:47:51] <duch_kazatel> oh that's a relief
[12:48:41] <fiveofoh> Lordy, some people learn better from a book than from a scattered bunch of API docs/tutorials on the web
[12:48:57] <duch_kazatel> fiveofoh that's not what we were debating.
[12:49:07] <duch_kazatel> i have a copy of javascript: the definitive guide that would agree with you.
[12:49:42] <duch_kazatel> but what he did seemed a little spammy.  that's all.
[12:49:44] <fiveofoh> It seems to be part of what we're debating.  The other part being whether posting a link to a good deal is spam
[12:49:57] <duch_kazatel> he didn't mean for it to be a bad thing.
[12:50:05] <BillCriswell> I'm not particularly afraid of any specific kind of ghost.
[12:50:06] <duch_kazatel> I wouldn't debate books could be good or bad.
[12:50:24] <joel000> uhm, I'd say that stating that @free books  are  STOLEN  makes the debate a bit different.
[12:50:34] <joel000> *in
[12:50:48] <fiveofoh> Where does the in go?
[12:50:49] <duch_kazatel> yeah, i think he misstepped there.
[12:50:56] <joel000> nowhere fiveofoh
[12:51:04] <joel000> it was for another chan
[12:51:10] <fiveofoh> Ah okay :P
[12:51:28] <fiveofoh> And that appeared to be a simple misunderstanding of your point about free guides
[12:51:35] <duch_kazatel> dude did something that was bad practice, felt backed into a corner, lashed out, and quit.
[12:51:39] <joel000> free has a meaning.
[12:51:42] <duch_kazatel> it's really not that big of a deal.
[12:51:44] <joel000> which certainly is not @stolen
[12:51:47] <fiveofoh> It's not like people pirating ebooks is unheard of
[12:51:50] <fiveofoh> Anyway
[12:53:10] <systemfault> I use pirated books all the time... (I buy the deadtree version.... steal the ebook :/)
[12:53:31] <duch_kazatel> i usually just use the deadtree versions and references when i need them.
[12:53:58] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: I'm often "on the go".... ebooks are often a better choice for me.
[12:54:10] <duch_kazatel> that works for you.  not saying that's not valid.
[13:00:51] <joel000> I found a better solution to the problem
[13:00:53] <duch_kazatel> jesus christ the browser property was funky.
[13:00:56] <joel000> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2059743/detect-elements-overflow-using-jquery
[13:02:37] <joel000> or even better, all in one line
[13:03:11] <joel000> if ( foo.width () !== foo[0].clientWidth || foo.height () !== foo[0].clientHeight ) {
[13:05:32] <joel000> ya jquery
[13:05:33] <joel000> var elt, hasOverflow = (elt = $('#blue1')).innerWidth() > elt[0].scrollWidth;
[13:10:32] <BillCriswell> That line is a bit confusing.
[13:11:30] <duch_kazatel> fun fact for today - the jquery browser detection code was about 30 lines
[13:11:57] <duch_kazatel> the core of it was this line: var match = /(webkit)[ \/]([\w.]+)/.exec(ua) || /(opera)(?:.*version)?[ \/]([\w.]+)/.exec(ua) || /(msie) ([\w.]+)/.exec(ua) || !/compatible/.test(ua) && /(mozilla)(?:.*? rv:([\w.]+))?/.exec(ua) || [];
[13:12:21] <BillCriswell> Ugh, browser detective.
[13:12:27] <BillCriswell> detection*
[13:12:37] <BillCriswell> .... weird typo, but it still works.
[13:12:43] <duch_kazatel> hahaha.  right?
[13:12:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm still working on this abatement and considered writing my own shim for it.
[13:13:26] <BillCriswell> I had to look that word up.
[13:13:38] <BillCriswell> Seems useful.
[13:13:42] <BillCriswell> Will have to try it out sometime.
[13:13:44] <duch_kazatel> we've been using it a lot around here.  we had to kill off mootools
[13:14:43] <BillCriswell> Is that still worked on?
[13:15:30] <duch_kazatel> i... don't know.
[13:16:31] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core
[13:16:32] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[13:16:34] <duch_kazatel> apparently it is.
[13:16:44] <BillCriswell> Yeah, looks like a couple days ago
[13:17:04] <duch_kazatel> 21 hours was the last merge.
[13:17:26] <BillCriswell> I imagine a lot of people just got really comfortable with it.
[13:17:44] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's likely the case.
[13:18:25] <BillCriswell> Hell... if I had Unreal Tournament around I'd still play that.
[13:18:43] <BillCriswell> I should find that.
[13:18:54] <decx> utler eh
[13:18:58] <decx> you make me sick
[13:19:03] <decx> quake 3 masterrace
[13:19:39] <BillCriswell> Haha what's utler?
[13:19:47] <decx> a ut player?
[13:19:50] <decx> ^^
[13:19:53] <BillCriswell> OH
[13:19:54] <BillCriswell> duh.
[13:20:02] <BillCriswell> I used to play a lot.
[13:20:22] <guide_X> how to add and remove selected to a select:option
[13:20:43] <BillCriswell> Thanks to it I'm immediately average at any first person shooter and it's pretty easy to get good... I still miss using a mouse and keybaord, so much more natural.
[13:21:02] <BillCriswell> guide_X: You can just change the value of the select.
[13:21:52] <guide_X> hmm it's a multiselect
[13:21:55] <BillCriswell> decx: I played the one that was the GOTY, that's about it.
[13:21:58] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Ah.
[13:21:58] <decx> well compared to the modern military slow sameness, i guess ut is still great
[13:22:32] <BillCriswell> It was a lot faster than the newer ones that came out... shock rifles are so much fun.
[13:22:54] <BillCriswell> guide_X: I'd imagine you can do like.. $('option:selected').prop('selected', false) ?
[13:23:01] <guide_X> ah ok lemme try
[13:23:22] <guide_X> i'm very sorry... I mean, disabled.. how do I enable and disable the options
[13:23:44] <decx> it's a prop like selected
[13:23:51] <BillCriswell> .prop('disabled', true) I think... never tried disabling an option in a multiselect.
[13:24:07] <guide_X> hmm disabled, true, and disabled, false both seem to disable
[13:24:22] <joel000> what does kill off mean
[13:24:23] <guide_X> let me try again..
[13:24:27] <decx> disabled is a bit finicky
[13:24:40] <decx> as it can be disabled=disabled or just disabled
[13:24:55] <joel000> <duch_kazatel> we've been using it a lot around here.  we had to kill off mootools
[13:25:25] <BillCriswell> guide_X: http://jsbin.com/fomuxixu/1/edit?html,js,output that work.
[13:25:34] <joel000> i'd like to hear a feedback about mootools
[13:25:44] <joel000> from experienced guyz like you all are
[13:25:44] <BillCriswell> joel000: Get it out of their code I'd imagine.
[13:25:55] <guide_X> that works great

[13:39:40] <fiveofoh> Huh, that's odd indeed
[13:40:07] <shoky> inconsistent bug, bad b-ot
[13:40:16] <fiveofoh> Anyway, we can play with the bot as needed in messages now
[13:41:47] <repxxl> i know how approximately make "click" show div
[13:41:57] <repxxl> but i want when they click outside anywhere on page
[13:42:02] <repxxl> the div again hides
[13:42:15] <repxxl> like a :focus system
[13:43:00] <jobelenus> hey all, im using jquery mobile with trigger.io/forge but something about jquery loading pages via ajax with `file://...` doesn't work (it used to work) and I cannot navigate anywhere. If i turn off the nice page transitions (ajaxEnabled = false) it works just fine, but of course looks like crap‚Ä¶ has anyone else had to deal with this problem?
[13:43:31] <fiveofoh> Most browsers won't let you access file:// via AJAX, I believe
[13:45:53] <repxxl> press div show div press anywhere on page hide div anyone know how to make this ?
[13:47:01] <BillCriswell> repxxl: Do you have an overlay you can listen on for the click?
[13:47:50] <BillCriswell> If not, I mean I guess you could listen for a click on body and make sure the event didn't originate from inside whatever you want to close.
[13:49:33] <Rafzzz> guys, if parameters['tsActionType'] = actionType; then what does data: parameters, equal in a .ajax POST header look like?
[13:50:00] <Rafzzz> {data : parameters}
[13:50:35] <BillCriswell> repxxl: Word?
[13:50:39] <Rafzzz> here's pastebin: http://pastebin.com/Vj9TmV8H
[13:51:22] <repxxl> BillCriswell overlay?
[13:51:41] <BillCriswell> repxxl: Like a background to show your modal on.
[13:51:44] <BillCriswell> Did you even say modal?
[13:52:09] <repxxl> BillCriswell y i have
[13:53:50] <BillCriswell> repxxl: http://jsbin.com/jevisezo/1/edit?html,js,output is the basic idea...
[13:54:26] <BillCriswell> repxxl: http://jsbin.com/jevisezo/2/edit cleared it up a bit.
[13:56:19] <BillCriswell> Hmm..
[13:58:52] <BillCriswell> Oh, that's notmal. Ok yeah that's cool
[13:59:07] <BillCriswell> repxxl: http://jsbin.com/jevisezo/3/edit there we go.
[13:59:20] <BillCriswell> Didn't know closest() looked at itself first. Perfect.
[14:03:55] <checkit> Hey guys... I need to return the value of a .getJson() funciton. I want to handle the returned data elsewhere but it's only returning udnefined whereas if I console data within the the function I do see all the objects returned.... Here's essentially what I have: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9536935
[14:04:15] <repxxl> BillCriswell thx but i wanted something like you click a button a box popup and when u want to close the box you click anywhere else       you know on some pages there are a "question mark" when u wanna know more details i look for something like this.
[14:04:19] <__joshua__> its asynchronous, the rreturn doesn't do much
[14:04:42] <BillCriswell> repxxl: This is that, just not styled.
[14:05:22] <repxxl> BillCriswell oh ok than thx i will go try to implement it to my existing divs. button
[14:06:01] <BillCriswell> checkit: You'd have to work with data in the callback of getJSON
[14:06:37] <checkit> BillCriswell: How to I initialize a call back here?
[14:06:44] <__joshua__> you already did
[14:08:02] <BillCriswell> Yes, $.getJSON('foo.json', function(data){ doSomethingWithData(data); }); function doSomethingWithData(data){ data.neatStuff; };
[14:08:14] <BillCriswell> Or just $.getJSON('foo.json', doSomethingWithData)
[14:08:21] <BillCriswell> and the function, of course.
[14:11:16] <BillCriswell> Later dudes.
[14:12:50] <shoky> checkit if you want to handle the data elsewhere, use the promises API:  var request = $.getJSON('foo.json');     ... then somewhere else:   request.then(function(data) { ... });
[14:13:06] <shoky> but notice it's still being handled inside a callback
[14:16:22] <jobelenus> hey all, does anyone know how the interface between jquery and xmlhttprequest object works? (e.g. how the `send` function of xmlhttprequest triggers jquery to complete its call-chain with the xhr response? im digging around in the source code, but can't quite pin it down
[14:16:36] <checkit> shoky: Okay... I think I got it. I'll give that a go.
[14:16:43] <duch_kazatel> jobelenus what exactly do you want to know?
[14:16:55] <duch_kazatel> because jquery does a bunch of calls to the underlying objects and whatnot for you.
[14:17:06] <duch_kazatel> also: jquery has a bunch of event bindings for you, too.
[14:18:34] <jobelenus> duch_kazatel: im assigning/overriding XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send, this.onreadystatechange is null, this.onload is null, where is a reference to a callback or something on the jquery end to say "Yes, i'm done, your turn" ? Because if i do nothing (besides change readyState = 4), it just errors out
[14:19:07] <duch_kazatel> woah why are you overriding those prototypes?
[14:19:11] <jobelenus> duch_kazatel: is there a promise reference i should complete?
[14:20:47] <jobelenus> duch_kazatel: because something between trigger.io and jquery mobile ajax loading of transitions has now broken (e.g. `file://...` used to work. now it doesn't) and I have a forge API that gives me local disk access for the device, so im handling `file://` references myself and loading the responseText‚Ä¶ if i turn ajaxEnabled = false in jquery mobile the `file://` references *work* -- but i get no transitions.. just ugly white fli
[14:21:49] <duch_kazatel> sounds like the version of something changed.
[14:21:58] <duch_kazatel> but good luck on figuring that one out.
[14:22:05] <shoky> jquery does set xhr.onload
[14:22:24] <shoky> and.. that's how it works
[14:22:36] <jobelenus> shoky: thats what i thought...
[14:24:50] <jobelenus> shoky: but `this.onload` within xmlhttprequest.prototype.send is certainly `null`
[14:25:18] <jobelenus> duch_kazatel: yes, i know something changed. but, do you know how ajax interfaces with xmlhttprequest?
[14:33:00] <shoky> jobelenus: it sets xhr.onload  http://jsfiddle.net/pZutK/
[14:33:31] <checkit> shoky: This is what I'm working with. Maybe this might help you understand what I'm trying to do.... http://jsfiddle.net/CHG2m/3/
[14:35:58] <shoky> checkit: change .complete to .done or .then  and it seems fine
[14:36:47] <checkit> shoky: No kidding... Alright.
[14:38:14] <checkit> shoky: Haha... That worked perfectly. Thanks bud. I appreciate your help with that.
[14:38:36] <jobelenus> shoky: hrmm.. then jquery mobile must be doing something odd.. b/c if i iterate over the properties of `this` within `send` i see: Property: onload Value: [null]
[14:39:07] <shoky> iterate how?
[14:40:01] <shoky> no idea what jquery mobile does
[14:41:11] <jobelenus> hrmmm‚Ä¶ it seems that `open` (which i'm also overriding) is what sets onload?
[14:41:21] <shoky> no
[14:41:42] <jobelenus> well: http://jsfiddle.net/pZutK/
[14:41:44] <shoky> from jquery src:  xhr.onload = callback();
[14:42:04] <jobelenus> right, i saw that line.. but see my change to the fiddle.. and how onload is now null
[14:42:08] <shoky> well what?
[14:42:15] <shoky> you linked to the same fiddle
[14:42:27] <jobelenus> http://jsfiddle.net/pZutK/1/
[14:42:28] <jobelenus> sr
[14:42:29] <jobelenus> y
[14:42:47] <shoky> huh
[14:42:57] <jobelenus> let the head scratching commence
[14:43:07] <shoky> you completely change the xhr implementation and expect stuff to work as usual?
[14:43:22] <jobelenus> well‚Ä¶ id love to see what the original xhr does.. but i can't introspect it
[14:43:32] <shoky> why tf are you calling .send from .open
[14:44:01] <shoky> jquery sets xhr.onload  after calling .open
[14:44:03] <shoky> and before calling .send
[14:44:14] <shoky> so obviously if you short-circuit that and call .send directly from .open . ..
[14:44:25] <shoky> this is pointless :P
[14:44:31] <shoky> stop wasting your time :\
[14:44:34] <jobelenus> ;)
[14:44:40] <jobelenus> i obviously don't understand it.. im trying to...
[14:45:09] <jobelenus> when i wasnt calling send, it was never getting to send.. it returned from open and not much of anything happened after that
[14:45:39] <jobelenus> but i may have fixed a problem that was killing me.. so.. trying without the send in there
[14:45:42] <shoky> probably because open didn't work as it should?
[14:45:46] <shoky> cause you killed it
[14:45:53] <shoky> why should send work then
[14:46:16] <jobelenus> can you help me how open ought to work then? b/c i can't introspect it.. i have no source code to look at to go "oh, that is how xmlhttprequest works"
[14:46:34] <shoky> don't touch the xhr prototype
[14:47:01] <jobelenus> well if trigger and jquery mobile played well together around loading local files through ajax, i wouldn't have to. but such is life
[14:47:11] <jobelenus> it used to work just fine. and then something in their guts changed and it broke
[14:47:20] <sammych> can someone rec a library that I can use for user interaction testing? Something to track user clicks, time between actions...basically I want to measure UI efficiency.
[14:47:48] <CarlFK> http://jsfiddle.net/UH7D7/24/  this is amusing.  click the <-+> thing.. it tries to escape
[14:47:50] <shoky> local xhr has been blocked by default for a while now
[14:47:52] <sammych> and I would have to point to a local server
[14:47:57] <sammych> it*
[14:48:20] <CarlFK> and if someone can help me make that zoom, that wold be fantastic.
[14:48:24] <jobelenus> shoky: hence my trying to get in there and use the forge.file js API to load local files
[14:48:35] <jobelenus> i literally have an api layer provided to me for interacting with local files
[14:48:46] <CarlFK> http://formstone.it/components/Zoomer/demo/index.html  makes it look so easy
[14:48:47] <jobelenus> and im trying to use it, but i dont understand well enough how xmlhttprequest works
[14:49:01] <shoky> jobelenus: sorry i've no idea how to help with your issue but i'm pretty sure you were going down a bad path
[14:49:26] <jobelenus> im not asking you to solve my problem. im asking you to help me understand how the xmlhttprequest interface works...?
[14:49:39] <jobelenus> i literally have my problem solved (e.g. local file access)
[14:49:45] <jobelenus> i just dont know how to return it through this interface
[14:49:46] <shoky> well, what's the question
[14:49:52] <checkit> Can anyone tell me how to remove an element from the DOM? Nothing I'm googling has worked so far....
[14:50:04] <duch_kazatel> "remove an element from the DOM"
[14:50:13] <duch_kazatel> .remove() is a good place to start.
[14:50:46] <jobelenus> shoky: http://pastebin.com/atnDDpb3
[14:50:47] <sammych> your googlefu is non-existent
[14:51:42] <duch_kazatel> checkit what did you google?
[14:51:54] <owen1> why $('.foo') returning an object and how to turn it into array?
[14:52:07] <owen1> (i have a few foo classes)
[14:52:13] <CarlFK> boo, I have to run.  bb in 20.
[14:52:14] <duch_kazatel> owen1 arrays are objects.
[14:52:22] <duch_kazatel> owen1 so.... what are you trying to do?
[14:52:39] <owen1> images.forEach
[14:52:43] <checkit> I can't find the tab now but something along those lines. I got some wierd results like delete $(object), or $(object) = $()...
[14:52:43] <owen1> returning undefined
[14:52:44] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[14:53:07] <duch_kazatel> either use .each() or a for loop.
[14:53:15] <duch_kazatel> the jquery object is an array like object.
[14:53:31] <owen1> duch_kazatel: interesting. so it doesn't have forEach?
[14:53:42] <jobelenus> shoky: does that pastebin make sense? e.g. i can do all the file access just fine, but i have no idea how to make the xmlhttprequest interface work
[14:54:01] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Can I remove a couple at a time? $('#obj1, #obj2).remove();
[14:54:08] <duch_kazatel> owen1 it's array-like, but I wouldn't treat it that way.
[14:54:15] <duch_kazatel> checkit Did You Try? (tm)
[14:54:33] <shoky> jobelenus: because you're not doing a real "open", a later method call on the xhr is causing an exception to be thrown, so .send isn't called
[14:54:44] <shoky> jobelenus: which.. makes perfect sense
[14:55:07] <jobelenus> yes, that does. where can i learn about what later methods are not being called that ought to be? since i can't see any source code here
[14:55:25] <duch_kazatel> owen1 don't treat it like an array.
[14:55:45] <duch_kazatel> well, not like a typical array at least.
[14:55:47] <shoky> jobelenus:  in jquery's source code.. .setRequestHeader  is one
[14:56:07] <jobelenus> shoky: OK.. i was suspecting that `open` itself had more to do
[14:57:26] <jobelenus> because i have a strong feeling that setRequestHeader is not required‚Ä¶ e.g. this works: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/tSVUjMLb
[14:57:27] <shoky> jobelenus: it's the only one in the way, at least in my fiddle
[15:00:19] <shoky> jobelenus: er i meant that setRequestHeader is throwing the exception, not that it's not being called
[15:00:40] <shoky> jobelenus: http://jsfiddle.net/pZutK/3/
[15:01:14] <nszceta> Greetings. 2.1 or 1.11?
[15:01:30] <jobelenus> shoky: i don't see it throwing an exception there. should i?
[15:01:59] <nszceta> Also, how can I make a table resizable and draggable? I have been looking at this for a few hours and I got a JPEG wrapped in a DIV to do this. But I am having a lot of trouble with CSS rules / etc for the table I am trying to build.
[15:02:07] <shoky> jobelenus: i thought you said .send isn't being called for you as well, no?
[15:02:07] <nszceta> Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. THX
[15:02:48] <jobelenus> shoky: correct -- http://pastebin.com/atnDDpb3
[15:02:58] <jobelenus> in that fiddle .send is being called for you
[15:03:27] <jobelenus> in your fiddle open does nothing, and the request still works
[15:03:35] <shoky> jobelenus: in my last fiddle? right, because i overwrote .setRequestHeader so it won't throw an exception
[15:04:22] <jobelenus> Oh‚Ä¶ i didn't get what you were trying to say‚Ä¶ ok...
[15:07:55] <nszceta> didn't
[15:09:38] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Try .remove()? I did and it works.
[15:09:56] <duch_kazatel> checkit huh?
[15:11:40] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Huh? I dunno what we're talking about.
[15:13:32] <duch_kazatel> oh, dude. <checkit> Can anyone tell me how to remove an element from the DOM? Nothing I'm googling has worked so far....
[15:13:38] <duch_kazatel> i told you to try remove
[15:14:32] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Haha... Yeah, I did. That's what i wrote about. It did and it worked.
[15:14:37] <checkit> above*
[15:14:48] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[15:22:20] <elnur> Hey. I'm trying to understand how to organize client side code better instead of having everything in $(function() {}).
[15:22:44] <elnur> I learned that there is RequireJS, but I'm struggling to understand its purpose and usage.
[15:23:36] <duch_kazatel> elnur there are tons of way to organize your code.
[15:24:05] <duch_kazatel> elnur it all depends on what you want to do.
[15:24:07] <elnur> Seems like it's loading the modules asyncly. But does it make sense if I concat and minify all my JS files anyway?
[15:24:21] <duch_kazatel> require only loads what you need when you need it.
[15:24:46] <elnur> I got that. But I contact everything into a single JS file.
[15:24:48] <duch_kazatel> if you're slapping everything together and shipping, you'll need to reconsider that entire idea.
[15:24:53] <elnur> So, everything is being loaded anyway.
[15:25:03] <elnur> Why? Is it a bad idea?
[15:25:26] <duch_kazatel> entirely depends.  the idea of require is to only load and execute what is required on the client side.
[15:25:30] <elnur> Isn't it a kind of good practice to contact and minify everything?
[15:25:38] <duch_kazatel> that idea is not compatible with what you are currently doing.
[15:25:46] <duch_kazatel> sure - depending on your goals.
[15:25:49] <elnur> Is that the only purpose of RequireJS?
[15:25:55] <Velveeta> if you're using the requirejs optimizer to bundle and inline everything as part of a grunt task or something, there's no need to write your code in a requirejs format really, you could just use grunt-contrib-concat and grunt-contrib-uglify instead
[15:26:16] <Velveeta> requirejs's strength is in lazy-loading your modules and managing dependencies for you
[15:26:18] <duch_kazatel> yeah there are tons of ways to skin that cat.  all with their own upsides and downsides.
[15:26:25] <elnur> Okay, so RequireJS makes sense only if I don't have a single JS file?
[15:26:48] <Velveeta> also, does your single js file include your libraries also? jquery/underscore/anything else?
[15:26:57] <elnur> Yes.
[15:27:10] <elnur> This way I can ship the whole JS code once and then cache it.
[15:27:18] <Velveeta> i would recommend you break those out into 2 file bundles
[15:27:25] <duch_kazatel> yeah, at least.
[15:27:28] <Velveeta> 1 that includes all of your libraries, and one that includes your application code
[15:27:36] <elnur> Why?
[15:27:44] <elnur> What's the motivation for that?
[15:27:46] <Velveeta> because from release to release, the chances of your application code changing is high, but the chances of your library code changing is minimal
[15:28:01] <elnur> Hmm. Good point.
[15:28:04] <Velveeta> so you maintain the benefit of the browser cache for all of your library, and the only piece that needs to be redownloaded is the much smaller application code bundle
[15:28:25] <Velveeta> because once minified and whatnot, that library bundle will probably be at least 100k vs < 20k for your application code typically
[15:28:27] <elnur> Yea, that makes perfect sense. Thanks for the hint.
[15:28:42] <Velveeta> no problem
[15:28:46] <elnur> But seems like this solves another problem.
[15:28:54] <elnur> While my current biggest question is about something else.
[15:29:10] <Velveeta> right, that was just a little tip i thought i'd throw out since you were talking about one monolithic file
[15:29:15] <elnur> I'm trying to understand how to properly break my app into modules.
[15:29:29] <elnur> And I thought RequireJS was an answer for that, actually.
[15:29:40] <Velveeta> as far as code organization is concerned, you can try looking into something like backbonejs, which will help you structure your code into modules, but relies on requirejs as well
[15:29:55] <elnur> I'm learning Node.js as well, and I like its `var http = require('http');` style.
[15:30:06] <elnur> I thought RequireJS was something like that but for client side.
[15:30:20] <Velveeta> however, if you write your code in modules and then use the requirejs optimizer, you'll still get one big file bundle of application code, but you also have the benefits of better organized code
[15:30:48] <Velveeta> correct, requirejs uses amd module format, whereas node uses commonjs format, but they're both a means of modularizing your code
[15:31:05] <Velveeta> requirejs does asynchronous module loading though, whereas node's method is synchronous
[15:31:16] <elnur> I thought Backbone was more like AngularJS.
[15:31:33] <Velveeta> only in the fact that it encourages separation of concerns between your code modules
[15:31:40] <elnur> So, I would go with one of them if I wanted a client side app using a Restful API.
[15:31:49] <Velveeta> their methods of implementation vary greatly... angular is much more heavy-handed, backbone is very minimalistic
[15:32:29] <Velveeta> as far as a restful api is concerned, that's always a good pattern to follow, but it's not a requirement of either angular or backbone.. you can write your own methods to parse your data prior to either of those frameworks consuming the response
[15:32:33] <elnur> So, am I at least correct that RequireJS for client side is like CommonJS in node?
[15:32:38] <Velveeta> yes
[15:32:42] <elnur> Good. :)
[15:33:12] <elnur> Sorry, phone. BRB.
[15:33:17] <Velveeta> no problem
[15:34:00] <joel000> why this code isn't working?
[15:34:03] <joel000> if( ($(this).offset().top > ($(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height() - 20))  {}
[15:45:30] <Velveeta> joe1000: have you tried console.log'ing what each of those values evaluate to?
[16:00:33] <Deele> Has anyone here got experience with Google Charts API?
[16:08:47] <CarlFK> http://jsfiddle.net/UH7D7/51/  works.  good.    Now trying to figure out how to zoom it in on load, but the docs are broken:  http://formstone.it/components/zoomer  "Pans plugin instances"  and gives the same example as the option above it: $(".target").zoomer("load", "path/to/image.jpg");
[16:10:00] <CarlFK> anyone have some guesses on how I can do that?
[16:14:41] <pik> why this no work http://pastebin.com/GZRDf2XM
[16:14:56] <pik> the second click work
[16:15:20] <pik> but i want now when the box is visible and people click anywhere i added "body" that it closes the box again
[16:15:42] <checkit> Probably a stupid question but in order for validate to work does it need to be a form object?
[16:16:46] <pik> this allways return ture if($('.more-details').css('visibility') == 'visible')
[16:16:50] <pik> also if its not true
[16:17:41] <pik> please jquery god give me a blessing.
[16:18:40] <pik> :/
[16:24:52] <pik> my aboutpanda div has visibility hidden at start if($('.AboutPandaID').css('visibility') == 'visible') and this is return true lol ?
[16:24:56] <pik> it should give false
[16:26:32] <duch_kazatel> pik how are you hiding it?
[16:27:07] <duch_kazatel> straight css? a library?  etc.
[16:27:56] <pik> duch_kazatel it works now but look http://pastebin.com/JZ6mRn0e  when the box is visible than i want to hidden it again when the user click anywhere on the page so i did 'body'
[16:28:02] <pik> duch_kazatel but it wont work ...
[16:28:04] <zumba_addict> hey folks, what are your thoughts about the trainings at lynda.com?
[16:28:19] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict lynda is very "eh" in my opinion
[16:28:37] <duch_kazatel> pik can you setup a functioning example on jsfiddle?
[16:28:39] <zumba_addict> i wanted to post a comment to my friend's fb post
[16:28:41] <zumba_addict> he posted it
[16:28:59] <duch_kazatel> i just don't see the use of a paid-for service like that any more.
[16:29:05] <zumba_addict> i want to say it safely but won't hurt him
[16:29:17] <Neobenedict> hi, I am noticing weird behavour with my script: http://pastebin.com/x8TFrqZY on one page of my site this script works when the URL is invalid but then if I change the textfield to make it valid and submit it again, the alert '1' pops up so the script is going correctly but the form doesn't get submitted. this seems to be on just one page. any ideas what is causing it?
[16:29:24] <zumba_addict> what's the best way to comment?
[16:29:46] <duch_kazatel> i'd mention codeacademy instead.
[16:29:47] <duch_kazatel> but that's me.
[16:30:16] <zumba_addict> i like codeacademy too
[16:30:55] <zumba_addict> i also tried codeschool before, I love it
[16:33:37] <zumba_addict> ah, it's for kids that he posted - http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Foundations-Programming-Programming-Kids/155284-2.html
[16:33:49] <pik> duch_kazatel can't you just help me from the paste bin ? i mean the point is if i click a box another box appear and than to close it i want to allow a body click so it closes again
[16:34:15] <fiveofoh> pik: If that paste is just in your <script> tag, that's gonna run once, set a listener for the body, and never run the second bit of code
[16:34:45] <pik> fiveofoh i have also on document ready
[16:35:15] <pik> fiveofoh how i set a listener for the body?
[16:36:40] <fiveofoh> Yeah, same effect.  You already set a listener for the body, that's what $(body).click() does.
[16:36:42] <CarlFK> pik: trying to get a good example in jsfiddle can be educational .. http://jsfiddle.net/UH7D7/59/  <- means I have tried 59 things.  somewhere around 50 is when stuff started working
[16:37:02] <fiveofoh> But if you can't be bothered to set up a fiddle, it's unlikely most of us can be bothered to help you figure it out
[16:37:11] <fiveofoh> Especially since you'll probably learn some things setting it up
[16:37:17] <zumba_ad_> did I get kicked out?
[16:37:22] <Neobenedict> any ideas?
[16:37:48] <fiveofoh> zumba_ad_: I still show your old nick here
[16:38:34] <duch_kazatel> woops
[16:38:43] <duch_kazatel> anyway - pik, your code is wrong.
[16:38:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4DhAG/
[16:40:07] <duch_kazatel> pik do you see the issue?
[16:40:33] <fiveofoh> pik: Here's a hint, I described it to you earlier
[16:40:34] <pik> duch_kazatel that it runs only once?
[16:40:39] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:41:06] <duch_kazatel> you're saying "if .AboutPandaID is visible, bind an event handler to hide it when i click on the body"
[16:41:21] <duch_kazatel> "otherwise, bind a handler to more-details that shows it"
[16:41:37] <duch_kazatel> either event handler gets bound, but never both.
[16:42:24] <pik> duch_kazatel can you correct it ? :D how should it be correct i would be happy alot
[16:43:30] <duch_kazatel> get rid of the if statement.
[16:43:30] <duch_kazatel> it's unnecessary.
[16:44:45] <pik> duch_kazatel ok but than it dont work even like it worked
[16:44:53] <fiveofoh> pik: If your solution to your problems is to have other people just fix them for you (rather than them helping you figure out what's wrong), you're less likely to find help on IRC
[16:45:14] <fiveofoh> pik: First step is to understand why what you had was wrong
[16:45:26] <Neobenedict> nobody can help me? :(
[16:45:34] <Neobenedict> whoah flood
[16:47:21] <duch_kazatel> see it no?
[16:47:21] <duch_kazatel> *now?
[16:47:21] <duch_kazatel> brb
[16:47:55] <pik> fiveofoh it's a pain for me to use js im more the php - database guy lets do it like this come on #php and give me a task i will help you and you will help me here on js
[16:48:22] <Neobenedict> ping timeout
[16:49:09] <pik> fiveofoh but y i sadly have to use js now because all css methods didn't worked well
[16:49:39] <fiveofoh> Neobenedict: Your description is a little bit vague, but I put together a jsfiddle of what I think you're getting at: http://jsfiddle.net/cincodenada/YtrP7/
[16:50:04] <fiveofoh> Look in the console for any error messages, step through it with a debugger
[16:50:07] <duch_kazatel> pik wtf
[16:50:07] <duch_kazatel> either way, your setup doesn't work.
[16:50:12] <duch_kazatel> pik you're getting caught up in event delegation.
[16:50:21] <Neobenedict> nobody then that has any ideas about my problem?
[16:50:27] <Neobenedict> oh thanks fiveofoh
[16:50:32] <Neobenedict> the network is lagging
[16:50:51] <fiveofoh> Not sure if it's causing a problem or not, but I believe you should have quotes around [name="value"] selectors
[16:50:52] <duch_kazatel> pik you really need to learn some basics.
[16:51:11] <duch_kazatel> pik is this for a modal window?
[16:51:12] <pik> duch_kazatel in js yes i do need
[16:51:23] <Neobenedict> okay fiveofoh that is correct
[16:51:33] <fiveofoh> pik: And you're not going to learn basics by having other people write your code for you because it's too hard
[16:51:33] <Neobenedict> the thing is, this is one page where it's not working as it should
[16:51:39] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[16:51:48] <Neobenedict> you put the wrong thing in, but if you correct it afterwards it should still submit
[16:51:56] <Neobenedict> on this page it's returning "1" and not submitting and I have no idea why
[16:52:12] <pik> fiveofoh come on i don't ask to write 30 lines im sure you can put this there put this there and its ready
[16:52:29] <duch_kazatel> pik wtf no not really.
[16:52:32] <duch_kazatel> pik answer my question.
[16:52:46] <pik> duch_kazatel sry yes modal window
[16:52:46] <fiveofoh> pik: Also, this isn't the last js you're ever going to do, by a longshot, if you're a web developer
[16:53:03] <duch_kazatel> pik is there an overlay you're using/
[16:53:21] <fiveofoh> Neobenedict: I assume you're including the JS from some common place, and there's not just some typo difference?
[16:53:50] <pik> duch_kazatel look i have a box hidden i want to show it and than you can click everywhere on the page and it dissapears
[16:53:52] <fiveofoh> At that point I'd step through, run the code in my head, check values to make sure they're what I think they should be, etc
[16:54:12] <duch_kazatel> pik then i refuse to help. your original code doesn't do what you want.
[16:54:14] <Neobenedict> fiveofoh: yes, it's all fine
[16:54:20] <Neobenedict> everything runs as it should
[16:54:28] <duch_kazatel> pik either use a modal library like jqmodal, or actually answer my questions.
[16:54:34] <Neobenedict> *except* what I described
[16:54:49] <pik> duch_kazatel what you mean by overlay ?
[16:55:01] <pik> duch_kazatel if the box overlay another boxes ?
[16:55:04] <duch_kazatel> pik are you greying out the background at all?
[16:55:10] <duch_kazatel> or is it just a new modal window?
[16:55:13] <pik> duch_kazatel no i don't
[16:55:32] <fiveofoh> Neobenedict: And there aren't any errors in the console or anything?
[16:55:49] <pik> duch_kazatel you know on some websites they have a "question mark" button when you click it a little popup box appear and than you can just click everywhere and it dissapears again
[16:55:58] <duch_kazatel> pik yeah, a tooltip.
[16:56:01] <duch_kazatel> right?
[16:56:13] <pik> duch_kazatel yes if you don't understand some words defitions
[16:56:19] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:56:53] <duch_kazatel> if the "little popup box" shows up next to the question mark, that's called a tooltip.  use powertip.
[16:56:57] <pik> duch_kazatel i mean you see on a website "fsadfsdfasdfasfsad" and there is a question mark button when you click it a little box popup and says u this means blabvla ... and then u close by click everywhere it dosn't matter
[16:56:57] <duch_kazatel> problem solved.
[16:57:00] <pik> and it closes
[16:57:02] <Neobenedict> that's correct, fiveofoh
[16:57:08] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's a tooltip.
[16:57:16] <duch_kazatel> use powertip.  save yourself the headaches/
[16:57:26] <pik> its a library?
[16:57:29] <duch_kazatel> yes
[16:57:44] <duch_kazatel> jquery powertip
[16:59:08] <fiveofoh> Neobenedict: Well I don't have any guesses at what could be causing that - if you return true from a submit() callback, it should submit :/ Unless you have an example of the brokenness to look at, we can't just guess what's wrong
[16:59:44] <fiveofoh> I'd start taking away parts of the problem page (or making the problem page progressively similar to a working page) until it starts working, if that's practical
[17:00:21] <m1chael> do a lot of you use jquery mobile?
[17:00:47] <Neobenedict> also fiveofoh, it works fine if you put a correct URL in to start with
[17:02:57] <motaka2> hello , why in this page when I submit th form I get nothing as nrows?  http://fa.noondreams.com/hotels/form/departments/web_department/
[17:06:35] <Neobenedict> instead of return true could I use something to submit the form fiveofoh?
[17:06:45] <Primer> I have this: $(window).on('error',function(e){myErrorHandler(e);}); In chrome e is a jQuery.Event object, which has an originalEvent property, which has an error property, which has a stack property. In Firefox no such error property exists within the originalEvent property. Is there any way to get this?
[17:11:16] <fiveofoh> motaka2: That's a question for your backend, not #jquery
[17:11:47] <motaka2> fiveofoh: I don't understand you. but I fixed it anyways
[17:12:18] <fiveofoh> motaka2: Your form output is being generated by PHP or ASP or whatever your backend language is, not by jQuery
[17:12:23] <fiveofoh> (or Javascript)
[17:12:51] <motaka2> fiveofoh: the problem was coming from js
[17:12:56] <motaka2> and I fiex it, variable names where wrong
[17:13:08] <fiveofoh> Primer: What information are you looking for?  It's quite possible jQuery has a standardized way of getting at it, but I don't know what originalEvent.error is
[17:13:44] <pik> duch_kazatel the effect work but the box is different i get just pure blank text.
[17:14:17] <pik> duch_kazatel and i also removed the css and tested span http://jsfiddle.net/2baqv/1697/
[17:14:41] <pik> duch_kazatel it still looks nice on my website i get just blank text
[17:15:04] <fiveofoh> Neobenedict: You may be able to use .submit()
[17:16:09] <fiveofoh> pik: That's not your code, that's the powerTip demo.  My guess: you didn't read the powerTip docs and did something wrong in your implementation
[17:18:27] <Primer> fiveofoh: I'm looking for a string that is the stack trace
[17:18:27] <motaka2> fiveofoh: when I click on this button ".recsBtnDel"    it submits the page
[17:18:27] <motaka2> how can I stop it ?
[17:18:40] <duch_kazatel> pik wtf
[17:18:45] <duch_kazatel> pik wow.
[17:18:59] <pik> duch_kazatel i got it now
[17:19:05] <Primer> which is available in chrome under e.originalEvent.error.stack
[17:20:37] <pik> duch_kazatel i handle brain part of websites not the make ups :D
[17:22:05] <fiveofoh> Primer: I doubt that's going to be available cross-browser, unfortunately
[17:22:33] <fiveofoh> Certainly not anything jQuery that I'm aware of, having to access the error stack programatically is an awfully odd usecase
[17:23:05] <fiveofoh> Primer: What are you trying to do?
[17:25:41] <duch_kazatel> pik javascript is more than "make ups" at this point.
[17:26:23] <duch_kazatel> wow.  what's up with freenode today?
[17:26:46] <pik> duch_kazatel oh really ? tell me about functionality of js
[17:26:53] <duch_kazatel> pik huh?
[17:27:01] <Primer> http://jsfiddle.net/7Rz7v/2/
[17:27:08] <Neobenedict> yes, that works, thanks fiveofoh
[17:27:09] <pik> duch_kazatel i mean js is only for design
[17:27:10] <Primer> in chrome I get a stack, in FIrefox I get dick
[17:27:12] <duch_kazatel> pik javascript is being used more and more.  you can run your whole site on node.js at this point.
[17:27:13] <Neobenedict> i'll use that for now.
[17:27:25] <duch_kazatel> pik so JS can be used however much you'd like in any way you'd like.
[17:27:37] <duch_kazatel> js is a much more fully featured language than a lot of people think.
[17:27:43] <Primer> fiveofoh: collect errors that happen on the site
[17:29:39] <pik> duch_kazatel ok u can do a game in js but you allways need a server side scripting for website "functionality" i talk about cms, login, register, user rating, likes, well everything that uses a db
[17:30:02] <duch_kazatel> pik node.js is a way to run javascript on the server.
[17:30:02] <fiveofoh> pik: See that's where you're wrong: node.js *is* a server-side language
[17:30:11] <duch_kazatel> no, node is not a language, fiveofoh
[17:30:14] <duch_kazatel> node is a runtime.
[17:30:27] <duch_kazatel> pik javascript just needs a host environment.
[17:31:23] <pik> duch_kazatel so basically u can connect with node.js to a website and don't use php only node.js ?
[17:31:37] <pik> to a "database" not website sry
[17:31:39] <pik> typos
[17:31:44] <duch_kazatel> [ol ues/
[17:31:47] <duch_kazatel> *pik yes
[17:31:58] <fiveofoh> Primer: Well in any event, it's not standard, and therefore won't be cross-browser, since it's a Chrome extension
[17:32:02] <duch_kazatel> you can use node as your runtime and write everything in javascript.
[17:32:20] <duch_kazatel> you can connect to databases, use it as your server, etc.
[17:32:24] <Primer> fiveofoh: oddly, the Mozilla docs say it's an IE extension
[17:32:40] <Primer> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error
[17:32:50] <Primer> err wait
[17:32:56] <Primer> it says it's a Mozilla extension!
[17:33:04] <pik> duch_kazatel well nice than you know any websites live that uses database with node.js a pure node.js website ?
[17:33:26] <pik> duch_kazatel i would like to visit one of there websites if you know one
[17:33:28] <Primer> All I'm missing is a reference to the error in the event passed to the error handler
[17:33:32] <duch_kazatel> http://nodejs.org/industry/
[17:33:38] <Primer> you'd think an error handler would be passed an error object...
[17:34:41] <duch_kazatel> pik linkedin, walmart, ebay, paypal, the new york times, yahoo... they're all using node in various capacities.
[17:35:21] <Primer> oh look https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355430
[17:35:41] <Primer> opened 2006, modified yesterday
[17:39:48] <jen_> Can I use jquery to detect browser OS?
[17:40:09] <duch_kazatel> jen_ why?
[17:40:21] <jen_> reliability?
[17:40:29] <duch_kazatel> that makes no sense.
[17:40:46] <duch_kazatel> reliability for...?  are you trying to work around problems?
[17:40:54] <fiveofoh> Reliability of what?  A huge point of jQuery is so you don't have to worry about browser differences
[17:40:59] <jen_> vs using standard navigator.UserAgent...
[17:41:10] <fiveofoh> No, but why do you want to know what OS you're on
[17:41:18] <jen_> ok, pause for a moment...
[17:41:32] <duch_kazatel> why do you need it?  often when you get to that point, it means you're doing something wrong.
[17:41:35] <jen_> I just fininished learning JS....
[17:41:46] <fiveofoh> I mean, if you're serving up software or something and want to serve up the proper download, sure, but other than that, you generally shouldn't care what OS you're on
[17:42:04] <jen_> and author recommended that I use JQuery to do any cross-browser detection.
[17:42:04] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest doing that server-side, tbh.
[17:42:09] <fiveofoh> jen_: I think you mean you just started learning JS ;) You're never done :P
[17:42:18] <jen_> haha
[17:42:25] <jen_> yes, you are probably right fiveofoh
[17:42:28] <duch_kazatel> jen_ who recommended it?  and why?
[17:42:51] <jen_> So, depending on OS, we need to show users Mac version or Windows version of software to DL.
[17:43:06] <duch_kazatel> do that detection server-side, imo.
[17:43:22] <jen_> I have script to sniff the browser that can work with IE8+
[17:43:47] <jen_> so use php duch_kazatel
[17:43:57] <duch_kazatel> i don't know php.
[17:44:19] <fiveofoh> jen_: The functionality you're looking for is deprecated, becuase it's not generally recommended: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[17:44:25] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[17:44:32] <duch_kazatel> it's removed in 1.11 and will cause headaches.
[17:44:37] <jen_> ok
[17:44:44] <duch_kazatel> that being said, navigator.platform has the info you might want.
[17:45:05] <jen_> so use something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf2ST/6/
[17:45:38] <fiveofoh> Yeah, for that, using jQuery isn't going to get you much advantage
[17:45:51] <fiveofoh> And in fact makes it impossible in newer versions
[17:46:03] <duch_kazatel> jquery doesn't handle "os detection"
[17:46:12] <jen_> wow, this is good information
[17:49:18] <fiveofoh> jen_: But you are in pretty much the only usecase in which you legitimately do need some sort of os detection.  jQuery just isn't really going to help you out there
[17:50:02] <CarlFK> http://formstone.it/components/zoomer docs say $.zoomer("defaults", opts);  ... opts default {}.  so shouldn't .zoomer() and .zoomer("defaults",{}) be the same?  (it seems to cause it to not work: http://jsfiddle.net/UH7D7/61/
[17:50:08] <fiveofoh> If you need something really heavy-duty, you may want to look at something like http://whichbrowser.net/, which combines serverside and clientside
[17:55:18] <CarlFK> yay.. this works: $(".viewer").zoomer({source:"http://192.237.240.167/static/veyepar/fosdem/fosdem_2014/img/s1-12.png"});
[17:55:33] <CarlFK> so I should be able to figure out how to use the other options...
[17:55:36] <CarlFK> i hope.
[17:55:59] <jen_> having a tough time differentiating object literals vs array literals when using variables.
[17:56:07] <jen_> can someone help explain this?
[17:56:25] <duch_kazatel> CarlFK generally, you'd do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/y4nM4/
[17:56:29] <duch_kazatel> jen what are you stuck on?
[17:56:39] <fiveofoh> jen_: Arrays are just a special case of objects
[17:57:02] <fiveofoh> If you're using for(x in object), don't - use $.each()
[17:57:06] <Velveeta_> jen_: you can use the $.type function to make it easy
[17:57:12] <Velveeta_> if you just need to know if it's an array or object
[17:57:16] <jen_> var car = {myCar: "Toyota", 7: "Mazda"}
[17:57:21] <jen_> what does this mean?
[17:57:24] <duch_kazatel> jen_ that's a plain object.
[17:57:26] <Velveeta_> that's an object literal
[17:57:29] <duch_kazatel> it has 2 properties.
[17:57:33] <duch_kazatel> myCar and 7
[17:57:34] <Velveeta_> array literals use square brackets
[17:57:41] <jen_> slow dooooownnn.
[17:58:05] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/QuRY3/
[17:58:19] <duch_kazatel> there.
[17:58:31] <CarlFK> duch_kazatel: yeah, just figured that out.. now to figure out how to start it off zoomed in
[17:59:04] <jen_> thank duch_kazatel
[17:59:07] * Velveeta_ passes out slingshots to duch_kazatel and fiveofoh, then perches behind some rocks with a big bucket of info ammunition.
[17:59:13] <duch_kazatel> :D
[17:59:36] <duch_kazatel> off-topic: any good template enging suggestions for node?  i don't like jade at all.
[17:59:55] <duch_kazatel> *engine
[18:00:07] <Velveeta_> i use jade and don't have problems with it... that being said, it also supports handlebars just fine
[18:00:21] <Velveeta_> and if you're writing server-side templates in handlebars, it makes for easy reuse on the client
[18:00:26] <Velveeta_> http://i.imgur.com/qvhVUPB.gif
[18:00:30] <duch_kazatel> rad.  i was also looking at dust
[18:00:48] <Velveeta_> here, lemme dig you up a sweet article about isomorphic js ;)
[18:00:58] <Velveeta_> http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/
[18:01:11] <Velveeta_> beautiful for things like form validation and partial templates
[18:01:24] <duch_kazatel> neat.  thank you
[18:02:14] <Velveeta_> and i wrote an article about it myself at one point, with some example implementations of js modules for use on both the server and the client: http://conqueringtheclient.com/my-descent-into-amd/
[18:12:38] <CarlFK> looking at source I see: load: function(source).  and {source:"foo.png"} works.  lower I see: pan: function(left, top) - how do I pass 50,50?
[18:13:00] <duch_kazatel> CarlFK huh?  can you link to the documentation?
[18:13:16] <CarlFK> http://formstone.it/components/zoomer  <-docs
[18:13:25] <duch_kazatel> and what do you want to do?
[18:13:28] <CarlFK> https://github.com/benplum/Zoomer/blob/master/jquery.fs.zoomer.js#L227
[18:13:52] <CarlFK> start zoomed in
[18:14:24] <duch_kazatel> that's a method.  you'd call .pan(50, 50);
[18:16:40] <danpsy> How can I push elements into an array by reference, instead of copying?  For example, var boxes = []; and boxes.push($('box-1')) and then, boxes[0].hide().  I feel like it'd be more efficient then just using $('box_'+i) every time I need to reference one.
[18:17:27] <duch_kazatel> danpsy can you setup a fiddle demonstrating what you're doing?
[18:17:32] <CarlFK> duch_kazatel: don't the docs say I can pass the 50,50 as parameters as options ?
[18:17:52] <CarlFK> duch_kazatel: (1/2 say.. they seem pretty garbled)
[18:17:56] <duch_kazatel> CarlFK the docs always say it's a method.
[18:26:14] <ikla> what function pulls data or html code from a div #id
[18:31:22] <TiMike> hi, to do a straight up text replace, is it cool to use jquery, or stick with plain js
[19:10:12] <zim> Hi all .ajax Q. code here http://jsfiddle.net/fDcqm/1/ problem I need use a var for the key in the data.
[19:11:31] <ikla> how do I remove everying in a <ul> ?
[19:11:47] <zim> God I have never seen #jquery so dead
[19:12:09] <zim> ikla, $('ul').html('')';
[19:12:42] <zim> ikla, $('ul').html('');
[19:16:30] <zim> Earth to #jquery anyone out there?
[19:17:16] <CarlFK> zim: I shouldn't be trying this... but how about $(this).attr('name')	: value,
[19:17:57] <CarlFK> zim: I don't know foo about js...
[19:18:05] <zim> CarlFK, will try
[19:18:07] <zim> ty
[19:19:13] <ikla> zim, how do I empty it?
[19:19:16] <zim> CarlFK, nope very unhappy js :-)
[19:19:28] <zim> ikla, what?
[19:20:09] <CarlFK> zim: yeah, I kinda figured.  I bet there is some bit of notation, like $filename or ... hmm
[19:20:59] <zim> ikla, .html('') will make all <ul>Foo</ul> = <ul></ul>
[19:22:08] <zim> Channel death test :-) vi is better than emacs!
[19:22:27] <CarlFK> is this valid js?       var data = {_token		: token};          data[fieldname] = value;
[19:22:28] <CarlFK>  
[19:23:34] <zim> CarlFK, no but you could be on the right track ty will play.

[20:28:44] <cabus> I was wondering if a kind soul would help me with some javascript/jquery code
[20:36:28] <BillCriswell> Never seen naturalWidth or naturalHeight before. Weird.
[20:38:01] <cabus> I am writing a chat application
[20:38:13] <cabus> and, the enter key should be registered as an event
[20:38:18] <cabus> but does not seem to be working
[20:40:53] <BillCriswell> cabus: What kind of event are you expecting?
[20:41:39] <BillCriswell> Where are you listening for it?
[20:43:21] <cabus>  $('.chat-input').on('keypress', function (ev) {
[20:43:43] <cabus>  var jid = $(this).parent().data('jid');
[20:43:59] <cabus> if (ev.which === 13) {
[20:46:00] <cabus> http://jsfiddle.net/cabusmichael/RU75S/1/
[20:48:27] <cabus> it's sort of tough to test as it is chat app
[20:48:41] <cabus> it all works, except when you try to send a message within the app
[20:59:06] <cabus> I posted something on the forum
[20:59:12] <cabus> maybe someone there can help
[21:16:26] <GoSox> how does .serialize() perform it's url encoding of a string? is there a function for that in javascript?
[21:20:42] <jphase> encodeURIComponent
[22:03:46] <luvmyh0nda> Hi, when working with an autocomplete-combobox, how can i trigger a click() or select() function? I've tried both, but can't quite seem to get it
[22:07:52] <jakobhans> I'm not sure of what you're trying to achieve
[22:08:44] <luvmyh0nda> i have a combobox which has a list of items to show per page. when they change the select box, i need to send an ajax request
[22:09:07] <luvmyh0nda> i have the ajax all written out, and it works when clicking just a page #'d button, and references said combobox to get the # of results
[22:09:20] <luvmyh0nda> but when the select element is changed, I need to perform the ajax call.
[22:09:30] <luvmyh0nda> neither select() nor change() fire when the box is changed.
[22:10:17] <jakobhans> And using $('#select_box_id').change(function() { alert('Changed!'); }); doesn't work?
[22:10:25] <luvmyh0nda> and if i show the underlying select box, and change it, that works
[22:10:47] <luvmyh0nda> but changing the combobox (which should, in theory, change the underlying <select> element) does not.
[22:11:58] <luvmyh0nda> well, it changes the value of the select box, but does not fire the select event
[22:12:08] <luvmyh0nda> er, change event
[22:12:20] <jakobhans> Ok, I get it
[22:13:04] <jakobhans> You should git a trigger when selecting
[22:13:19] <jakobhans> Have you tried something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4760285/jquery-ui-combobox-onchange
[22:14:02] <luvmyh0nda> would i have to destroy it prior? I use a class 'combobox' to initialize all of them
[22:15:04] <jakobhans> I'm not sure, do you want a different action on every combobox?
[22:15:21] <luvmyh0nda> well, same option for 2 of them. there are other comboboxes which are initialized via that class
[22:15:32] <luvmyh0nda> i'm going to try to see what i can fanagle together with that
[22:16:07] <jakobhans> Maybe the initialisation can be with the class and add the change property by id's?
[22:16:18] <jakobhans> OK, good luck!
[22:26:13] <luvmyh0nda> ehhh.... still maybe not?
[22:27:37] <luvmyh0nda> Cork: I see you're in here, any input on this one?
