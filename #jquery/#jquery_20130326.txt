[00:00:31] <Cork> dwarder: thats not part of jquery or jquery-ui
[00:13:49] <hello314159> hey!
[00:13:56] <hello314159> question, if anyone's around
[00:52:10] <anli> In jquery datatables, is there a way to have a different number of columns than the json data sub arrays?
[01:19:03] <Grundell> Hello dear jQuery people, i seam to have a slight problem. I am ajaxing in a page (load) which consists of a datatable that is responsive with a jquery $.widget script. I cant seam to get this script to work inside the ajax load... the fallowing code is what i have... what might have i done wrong?
[01:19:05] <Grundell> http://jsfiddle.net/yJcdK/
[01:19:30] <spikhoff> i'm trying to bind click to child element to open file browsing windows from div click... is this is a good solution?: http://jsfiddle.net/psGUr/2/
[01:27:55] <mongag> Is there a way to execute code if one of 2 events happens. Something like $('#form').submit(function() {}) || $('#el').change(function() {}) { code here } ?
[01:27:55] <dawncold> Cork: hi, I have figured out the ajax issue in IE6…just reinstall a pure windows xp...
[01:28:37] <Cork> dawncold: well removed it, not sure i agree you figured it out :)
[01:28:46] <systemfault> mongag: Just assign the function to a variable and use it for both events.
[01:28:54] <Grundell> is any one able to help me with my what i assume is a little problem ?
[01:29:37] <Cork> mongag: as you want to bind it on two different elements, the best solution is to create a named function and use that
[01:29:46] <Cork> opps too late :x
[01:30:12] <mongag> thanks
[01:30:47] <Cork> Grundell: where do you need the script?
[01:31:06] <Cork> Grundell: if you need it for inline scripts in the url what you're doing won't work
[01:31:41] <Grundell> Cork i need it inside a ajaxed url.
[01:32:16] <Cork> Grundell: then you need to request the script before you request the page
[01:33:36] <Grundell> So the whole script with the page looks like  - http://jsfiddle.net/sEHz2/
[01:33:45] <Grundell> okay and how do i do this ?
[01:34:29] <Grundell> Cork - simply want the scripts that im loading to work inside the (.load) function
[01:34:39] <Cork> Grundell: http://jsfiddle.net/yJcdK/1/
[01:36:29] <Grundell> Cork: now it doesn't want to work at all...
[01:36:39] <Cork> Grundell: uh, inside the load callback or for the content you load with .load?
[01:37:12] <Grundell> Okay, it doesn't load the page... and then it says it hasn't jquery widget...
[01:37:13] <Cork> opps forgot the this variable
[01:37:45] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/yJcdK/2/
[01:38:05] <Cork> ya, that script won't work as its cross domain
[01:38:18] <Cork> but it should work if you run it on the same domain
[01:38:31] <Grundell> okay...
[01:40:00] <Grundell> Cork: now i import the datatable but cant seam to have the responsiveness to it ...
[01:40:32] <mongag> I'm using return false if some of the input fields is empty. Now i put the validation code in function and call that function on $('#form').submit(); The error alert box appear but when I click OK the form is submitted
[01:40:34] <Grundell> if ( $.isPlainObject( value ) ) { is a error and  TypeError: $.widget is not a function but i clearly import the widget mini script
[01:40:37] <mongag> Cal could be the problem?
[01:41:28] <mongag> What*
[01:41:47] <Cork> Grundell: you need to chain the calls so things are guaranteed to be loaded before the code depending on it runs
[01:41:59] <Cork> Grundell: so you need to move them around to construct that order
[01:42:04] <Grundell> okay
[01:45:11] <Grundell> Cork: So when i click it it loads but then it doesn't work if i click it again it loads the right way and after like 2 sec it disapears again...
[01:45:34] <Cork> Grundell: no, it just that you have already loaded the scripts
[01:45:57] <Cork> Grundell: remember you aren't loading into an isolated container
[01:46:02] <Cork> your loading it into the current page
[01:46:03] <Grundell> Cork: hang on ill upload everything so that you will be able to see ...
[01:46:09] <Grundell> yeah
[01:50:19] <Grundell> Cork: http://dressupinyou.se/sector-alarm/ okay, if you scroll down and press the orange button "prisjämförelse" while in mobile view mode youll see that it loads everything and then the table is to big, but if you click it again you will have the table as it should look for like 4 sec and then it goes back...
[01:52:48] <Grundell> cork: sorry my laptop crashed what did you say (if you said anything?)
[01:53:23] <Cork> Grundell: 1. your loading a full html page into a dom element; that results in invalid html, you need to filter out a section in the response
[01:53:45] <Cork> 2. the url script depends on the widget script, so you need to switch those two around
[01:55:25] <Cork> Grundell: ex. .load($(self).attr('href') + ' #larmleverantor')
[01:55:27] <Grundell> 1. well im filtering out the div #larmverantor form a div... isnt that enough or do i need to do anything else?
[01:55:54] <Cork> no your not filtering anything
[01:56:06] <Cork> oh...
[01:56:15] <Cork> you have the selector in the url?!?
[01:56:21] <Cork> please don't >_<
[01:56:51] <Cork> at the very leas move it into a data-section="#larmleverantor" or something like that
[01:57:13] <Grundell> Cork: sorru crashed again... my graphics card seam to have a strain on it...
[01:57:24] <Cork> <Cork> oh...
[01:57:24] <Cork> <Cork> you have the selector in the url?!?
[01:57:24] <Cork> <Cork> please don't >_<
[01:57:31] <Cork> <Cork> at the very leas move it into a data-section="#larmleverantor" or something like that
[01:57:43] <Grundell> So if we take it from 1. and 2.
[01:58:09] <Cork> .load($(self).attr('href') + ' ' + $(self).data('section'))
[01:58:23] <Cork> btw side note <article class="class="post-362 alarm type-alarm status-publish hentry clearfix"">
[01:59:00] <Grundell> Cork okay so i should move the selector in to the slection or the +' '+
[01:59:19] <Cork> Grundell: move the selector out of the url
[01:59:22] <Grundell> Interesting, should look in to that.
[01:59:29] <helpless> PING
[01:59:29] <Cork> into what doesn't really matter
[01:59:37] <Grundell> yeah. and put it exactly where...
[01:59:50] * kaela slaps helpless
[02:02:04] <Grundell> cork,  $("#table-wrapper").load($(self).attr('href') + ' #larmleverantor ' + $(self).data('section')) is the right way ?
[02:02:14] <Cork> no
[02:02:27] <Cork> Grundell: your doing it twice there :)
[02:02:45] <Cork> Grundell: if you can have it statically use the string
[02:02:57] <Grundell> Cork - sorry that im a novice...
[02:02:59] <Cork> if it needs to be specified for each link use the data-section=""
[02:03:43] <Cork> Grundell: <a href="url" data-section="#larmleverantor">
[02:03:49] <Grundell> Okay
[02:03:53] <Cork> if you need it to be different for each link
[02:05:26] <Grundell> cork, the data section didn't seam to work...
[02:05:35] <Grundell> got the whole page instead
[02:06:31] <Cork> yay netsplit...
[02:06:53] <Grundell> haha
[02:09:09] <Cork> Grundell: try moving the # out of the section
[02:09:21] <Cork> that is ' #' + $(self).data()
[02:11:04] <Grundell> Cork now it doesn't seam to load
[02:11:19] <Grundell> or it loads the page but doesn't print it...
[02:11:39] <Cork> Grundell: ya, .data doesn't work for you for some reason
[02:11:43] <Cork> weird
[02:11:54] <Cork> replace it with attr('data-section')
[02:12:05] <Grundell> Cork okay
[02:12:09] <Cork> don't understand why it doesn't work though...
[02:12:17] <Cork> (.data that is)
[02:13:02] <Grundell> Cork now it loads
[02:13:12] <Cork> ok, now then switch place on widget and url
[02:13:21] <Cork> (that was 2.)
[02:13:52] <Grundell> Cork: still same problem.. .
[02:14:14] <Grundell> or do i need to switch places on the vars to ... assume not ...
[02:14:22] <Cork> where are you doing the table connections?
[02:14:28] <Cork> no you don't need to
[02:14:54] <Grundell> the url is the table responsive table scripts
[02:15:05] <Cork> ah
[02:15:07] <Cork> >_<
[02:15:18] <Grundell> okay :) ?
[02:15:22] <Cork> then i missunderstood the structure before
[02:15:37] <Grundell> oh okay
[02:16:01] <Cork> .load(..., function() { $.getScript(widget, function() { $.getScript(url); }); });
[02:16:03] <Cork> that should work
[02:17:04] <Grundell> hmm so i should keep var self = this, but move down the get scripts inside the load ?
[02:19:29] <Cork> yes
[02:19:38] <Cork> as the secripts has to run after the html has been added
[02:19:42] <Cork> else it doesn't find them
[02:19:58] <Grundell> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/xvZV6/ missing something heere
[02:20:06] <Grundell> Cork ahh okay
[02:20:50] <Cork> Grundell: ya, that looks like it should work
[02:21:29] <Grundell> Cork: seams like i actually surf to the page that i want to ajax in to the page
[02:22:50] <Cork> Grundell: you move return false; into the load call
[02:23:13] <Cork> Grundell: another tip, don't use return false; use event.preventDefault() at the beginning of the event instead
[02:24:22] <Grundell> Cork so i pop event.preventDefault in the right beginning after .ready ?
[02:24:38] <Grundell> Or at the actual click function ?
[02:27:15] <Cork> in the click function
[02:27:29] <Cork> click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); })
[02:31:51] <Grundell> Cork - the prevent default doesn't seam to work now....
[02:33:31] <Grundell> Cork - fallowing code...

[02:34:53] <constantin_mike> hello
[02:35:08] <Grundell> cork - ahh okay
[02:35:09] <constantin_mike> using bootstrap/alerts, is there any way to hide/show the same alert, instead of close/removing it?!!
[02:35:49] <Grundell> Cork still no sucess...
[02:37:51] <Cork> Grundell: your missing a comma in the load call
[02:38:20] <Grundell> Cork, okay actually sitting an looking for just that... where... ?
[02:38:41] <Grundell> is it after the data section
[02:38:42] <Cork> Grundell: before the function()
[02:38:43] <Grundell> '?
[02:39:45] <Cork> attr('data-section'), function()
[02:40:12] <Grundell> Cork, yeah got that... :) still no sucess...
[02:42:23] <Grundell> Cork, Okay! missed that i had one ); to much in the end.
[02:42:32] <Grundell> So now its working as it should :)
[02:42:56] <Grundell> Cork, Thank you so much for your patient help!
[02:46:39] <RobinFTW> Hi there! I am doing some research on jquery plugins and I was wondering if there was a resource available with the amount of plugins vs. time?
[02:48:30] <Cork> Grundell: you might want to split it up on separate lines to make it easier to read
[02:49:18] <Grundell> Cork: yeah thats what i did and realized that i had missed that...
[03:00:27] <constantin_mike> using bootstrap/alerts, is there any way to hide/show the same alert, instead of close/removing it?!!

[03:03:17] <NET||abuse> hi folks, having a bit of trouble initialising my ui slider, i want to trigger the slide event on page load so certain elements on the page get updated properly on load.
[03:03:41] <NET||abuse> i've been trying to use some stuff mentioned on stackoverflow but it's not working.
[03:04:42] <NET||abuse> i try adding the slidechnage event after initialising the slider with a chain call like so $slider.slider(slideroptions).bind('slidechange',eventhandlername);
[03:04:53] <NET||abuse> then just $slider.trigger('slidechange');
[03:05:12] <NET||abuse> now, am i using incorrect way of setting this up or the wrong event name?
[03:05:25] <NET||abuse> or is this just completely the wrong approach?
[03:05:59] <NET||abuse> I notice that the slidehandler still gets called on the slide event as it is. it's the trigger call that's just not working.
[03:06:16] <NET||abuse> it says the ui object is uninitialised in the handler so i can't get ui.value.
[03:07:20] <baptistem> o/
[03:09:43] <spobat> why won't this css rule work?
[03:09:45] <spobat> #view-chat-log-*
[03:09:46] <anli> When I use @Html.EditorFor(model => model.Foo.Bars): where Bars is of type public virtual ICollection<Foobar> Bars { get; set; }, I get a server error about public override void Execute() being overridden, but there is nothing suitable to override
[03:09:53] <anli> oops, wrong channel
[03:09:54] <anli> sorry
[03:09:56] <spobat> it should for example capture #view-chat-log-java
[03:11:50] <NET||abuse> tried updating to just hte 'slide' method on the bind and trigger calls. and switched bind to on()  sitll no luck triggering slide event.
[03:11:59] <NET||abuse> where does it get the ui object from?
[03:13:53] <NET||abuse> i also tried $slider.slider('option','slide').call($slider);  and it says can't call method 'call' of null
[03:19:16] <NET||abuse> ahh, this one works..
[03:19:49] <NET||abuse> http://url.ie/h514
[03:20:02] <NET||abuse> sorry, long url had to shorted. stackoverflow answer.
[03:20:55] <NET||abuse> so use the .slider('option','slide').call(   proceedure, but pass in the slider object, null and object of {values:sliderobj.slider("values")}
[03:21:04] <constantin_mike> using bootstrap/alerts, is there any way to hide/show the same alert, instead of close/removing it?!!
[03:21:16] <NET||abuse> working, although i have new error showing up further along hanlder method..
[03:21:44] <NET||abuse> constantin_mike: there's $.show() and $.hide()
[03:21:49] <NET||abuse> or $.toggle()
[03:21:59] <constantin_mike> yes, but when i click the x close button
[03:22:04] <constantin_mike> it destroys the element
[03:22:08] <constantin_mike> i just want to hide it
[03:22:10] <NET||abuse> write a handler and override
[03:22:20] <constantin_mike> ok, thanks
[03:22:21] <NET||abuse> and e.preventDefault() to stop the method bubbling up
[03:23:50] <spobat> hey guys
[03:24:17] <spobat> I want to have a nicely-designed list on which I can dynamically add list items that are animated
[03:24:22] <spobat> I found bootstrap-dropdown: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#dropdowns
[03:24:33] <spobat> they are not intended for lists, but I couldn't find any better.
[03:24:56] <NET||abuse> jquery ui has a sortable lists object that can do that
[03:25:05] <spobat> What do I mean by animated? If I `addNewListItem(obj, 'newone')` I want it to nicely arrange in it/pop up with an animation
[03:25:10] <NET||abuse> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
[03:25:15] <spobat> (instead of a direct change)
[03:25:46] <NET||abuse> look at hte connect lists idea for an example.
[03:25:57] <spobat> hte?
[03:26:01] <NET||abuse> you'll have to customize it somewhat but it'll do what you want.
[03:26:09] <NET||abuse> :) the
[03:26:14] <spobat> ah
[03:26:26] <larusso> hiya! got a question: i'm retrieving a javascript element through a json call and try to insert it into a page. when setting the innerhtml of a div with the retrieved javascript element, its as if the javascript contents get removed by jquery, but the contents of the script are still executed. any idea why this might be?
[03:27:02] <spobat> NET||abuse, yep, what I searched for, thank you.
[03:27:09] <NET||abuse> np
[03:27:17] <spobat> btw, do you know how I can this pretty bootstrap style to it?
[03:27:42] <NET||abuse> hah, i've not used bootstrap at all ... been out of js css until now for about 2 years
[03:27:59] <NET||abuse> just coming back to some form work this week
[03:28:07] <spobat> okay, can I search within such a list?
[03:28:18] <NET||abuse> yeh, there's a quick search filter tool i've seen
[03:28:29] <NET||abuse> field up the top and it live filters the list as you type.
[03:28:43] <spobat> Imagine on the left list I got the "colors" one likes, on the right there are all colors, with a textbox above it so one can search for colors directly
[03:28:53] <NET||abuse> https://github.com/travishorn/jquery-filterList/blob/master/example.html
[03:29:52] <NET||abuse> here's discussion on it http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-quicksearch-new-version
[03:30:02] <NET||abuse> oooh, kinda old.
[03:30:20] <spobat> okay, cool
[03:30:32] <NET||abuse> i built it myself about 2 years ago.
[03:30:41] <NET||abuse> should be well achievable.
[03:31:27] <NET||abuse> here's someone else who did it. http://anthonybush.com/projects/jquery_fast_live_filter/demo/
[03:32:15] <NET||abuse> larusso: would need to see it. not sure how your doing it so couldn't say
[03:36:08] <johnathanb> I'm doing a cross domain ajax post but looking at the network inspector in Chrome is doens't seem to be using the full url, my url is http://myurl.loc/api/audit/locations, but the network inspector says the URL trying to be loaded is http://mysite.loc/api/audit
[03:37:11] <Cork> johnathanb: and your sure the url you give to ajax i complete?
[03:37:18] <Cork> *you're
[03:37:25] <johnathanb> Yep
[03:37:29] <johnathanb> https://gist.github.com/Johnathan/b08bc8f1e0f1f76d8973 That's my ajax call
[03:37:55] <Cork> ah, thats not a post :)
[03:38:01] <johnathanb> Ah fuck.
[03:38:15] <Cork> johnathanb: you can't do cross domain posts normally
[03:38:33] <Cork> unless the server supports cors and the server is configured to support it
[03:38:41] <johnathanb> I've set the cross origin header things on the server
[03:38:45] <johnathanb> I have control of everything
[03:38:51] <Cork> uh, * unless the browser supports it
[03:39:06] <Cork> johnathanb: then there is no need for jsonp
[03:40:34] <johnathanb> I've switched it to a POST and removed jsonp but I'm still getting the same results
[03:41:14] <Cork> run an console.log(base_request_url + "api/audit/locations") before the ajax call
[03:41:16] <johnathanb> Ah server problem. All sorted. Thanks for the tips Cork
[03:44:38] <edoc> ohh . http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/9885632/Nick-DAloisio-Britains-17-year-old-app-entrepreneur.html
[03:44:58] <edoc> easly to code.
[03:48:29] <larusso> NET||abuse: i've posted a simple version of whats going on here: http://jsfiddle.net/FNedV/1/
[03:52:15] <pingec> I have an element, if I click on it, click events are totally not firing in chrome for android. Not even $(document).click or $(window).click, if I click anywhere else (not on that element) the events get fired. What could possibly be the cause of this behavior?
[03:52:27] <pingec> by click on it i mean tap
[03:52:32] <phrearch> hi
[03:52:51] <Cork> pingec: you prob have an event handler or attribute that does return false;
[03:52:59] <phrearch> im trying to inject jquery into the dom, but my page keeps hanging
[03:52:59] <phrearch> http://paste.kde.org/709382/
[03:53:07] <phrearch> any idea why this may not work?
[03:53:13] <pingec> Cork how could I debug/find it ?
[03:53:44] <Cork> pingec: search through the code
[03:53:57] <Cork> there isn't really a reliable way to do it any other way
[03:54:16] <pingec> but in all the other browsers it works
[03:54:24] <pingec> I click and all click evenethandlers are fired
[03:54:31] <Cork> pingec: greasmonkey?
[03:54:38] <Cork> opps wrong user
[03:54:47] <Cork> phrearch: greasmonkey?
[03:55:07] <Cork> pingec: ok, then check so nothing is covering the element
[03:55:30] <Cork> (ex. a div that becomes wider then it should be)
[03:55:31] <phrearch> Cork: no, trying with a bookmarklet
[03:55:41] <pingec> but why would that matter?
[03:55:58] <pingec> shouldnt click still get captured on window or document?
[03:56:11] <pingec> or you mean that that div could be returning false hmm
[03:56:21] <Cork> phrearch: try with document.head.appendChild(jqScript)
[03:56:40] <Cork> pingec: not if THAT element has a listener
[03:56:57] <Cork> pingec: but yes, if the event isn't stopped the document should always get it
[03:57:18] <phrearch> Cork: the cdn jquery works fine
[03:57:21] <Cork> pingec: if you could make a working example in jsfiddle it would help
[03:57:24] <phrearch> weird
[03:57:51] <phrearch> the whole browser hangs when i try to inspect elements in chrome webdev
[03:57:54] <Cork> phrearch: might be cause you go between public and private network scope
[03:58:03] <phrearch> Cork: yea probably
[03:58:09] <phrearch> ill use the cdn version for now. thanks
[03:58:42] <pingec> i will try bump z index up
[03:59:00] <Cork> pingec: did you say you could reproduce it in chrome?
[04:00:30] <pingec> I can reproduce it everytime in chrome for android
[04:00:36] <pingec> on desktop chrome it works fine
[04:00:40] <Cork> ah
[04:00:48] <pingec> but i can debug remotely
[04:00:48] <Cork> and the built in browser?
[04:00:58] <pingec> built in browser works
[04:01:02] <Cork> O_o
[04:01:26] <Cork> no clue then
[04:01:43] <pingec> ok thx for the ideas
[04:02:24] <Cork> pingec: a demo might help, but not sure
[04:02:38] <Cork> sounds like it most likely is a browser bug
[04:03:41] <pingec> I must thing about it
[04:03:48] <pingec> *think
[04:03:54] <pingec> to reproduce a demo will take time
[04:04:19] <Cork> pingec: ya, things like this normally take days to fix
[04:04:35] <pingec> Is it possible to detach all eventhandlers for all elements?
[04:04:38] <Cork> as it most of the time includes reducing the page until you find what triggers it
[04:04:57] <Cork> you can unbind all event listeners jquery knows about
[04:05:04] <Cork> $('*').off()
[04:05:34] <Cork> but that leaves event attributes, and events added through native means
[04:06:25] <pingec> I will try
[04:06:36] <pingec> and see if click is captured on window then
[04:13:31] <pingec> $('*').off(); $(window).click(function(){debugger;}) does capture it so it's not a browser bug I
[04:14:16] <Cork> pingec: still sounds like it most likely is a browser bug
[04:14:35] <Cork> (or a code bug that only affects chrome :) )
[04:15:03] <pingec> hehe
[04:19:23] <noregret> for anybody use bootraps .popover(), nny idea how to apply it to dynamic content ? i knonw that i can use .on() for events, but what about .popover() in this case? it's not an event by itself
[04:19:29] <noregret> using *
[04:20:14] <Cork> noregret: quite sure you will have to run it on newly added elements
[04:21:21] <Cork> noregret: or you could set it to not bind the events it self, and do it from your own on delegation
[04:22:51] <noregret> Cork: well, content is added from several place, and calling it will be redundant, but i guess i'll go with that since it's the fastest way
[04:23:16] <MacroMan> Is there something similar to .change() that I can bind to a text input to fire when the text is changed and not when the element loses focus after being changed?
[04:23:32] <air__> keyup ?
[04:24:07] <air__> MacroMan: if you want to trigger on someone writing in the input field.
[04:24:08] <Cork> MacroMan: there is one on the way, but not supported by all browsers yet
[04:24:32] <MacroMan> I guess I'll have to stick with keyup for now. Thanks guys
[04:24:35] <Cork> and keyup only triggers when a button is released so if you want as they type it will lag
[04:24:47] <Cork> .g mdn event input
[04:24:48] <b-ot> Cork: input - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference/input
[04:25:05] <Cork> for future reference ^
[04:25:09] <MacroMan> Thanks
[04:25:29] <Cork> but it only works in chrome and firefox for now (if i remember correctly)
[04:25:47] <Cork> oh, no it works in opera too
[04:25:52] <Cork> (though its buggy)
[04:26:31] <MacroMan> Looks like it's html5, so any new browser if it's not too buggy
[04:27:24] <MacroMan> It's just to update text in a div elsewhere with the text typed in the input box so nothing too complex
[04:27:59] <Cork> MacroMan: i usually do that with a keypress event and a timer
[04:28:12] <Cork> its what works best, as far as i can see
[04:28:56] <Cork> MacroMan: .keypress(function() { var self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { self.val() }, 0) });
[04:31:05] <MacroMan> It's not going to be heavily used, so I'll stick with keyup for now. The docs say keypress() isn't consistent across browsers, so I'll give that a miss for now.
[04:38:52] <MacroMan> Hmm. Trying to get the true width of a text element without the css styling. I'm thinking copy the text to a new span that I position off screen and get the size. Thoughts?
[04:53:14] <Cork> MacroMan: doens't have to be offscreen, but ya, thats the only way
[04:54:19] <Cork> MacroMan: var tester = $('<span/>'); $(document.body).append(tester); tester.text(value); tester.width(); tester.remove();
[05:26:27] <noregret> http://bpaste.net/show/SG0FgRrR6QEOKcVJMZ8C/ should't here data-content contain somedata after line 2? because it contains nothing when 'comments' is appeneded
[05:29:07] <Cork> noregret: no, that's not a property
[05:29:13] <Cork> either attr or .data
[05:29:30] <Cork> and no you don't store the generated dom, so the change is lost
[05:29:46] <Cork> browsers work with the dom, not html
[05:30:16] <Cork> and additionally $('a', comments) won't match anything
[05:30:22] <Cork> cause the a tag doens't contain any a tags
[05:30:45] <noregret> wow, everything i did was wrong =)
[05:30:58] <noregret> Cork: what's teh ebst way to achieve what i want here
[05:31:26] <Cork> var comments = $('<a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="" title="Comments">Comments</a>'); comments.attr('data-content', '');
[05:31:40] <noregret> Cork: note that, i could just put the v.sample.usercomment directly in 'comments' but it might contain quotes
[05:31:43] <noregret> aha
[05:31:44] <anli> What is the preferred way of creating a listbox in html?
[05:32:04] <anli> <select> with a size attribute set to 3 or higher, it seems
[05:32:17] <anli> I also have to set width and height styles
[05:32:26] <noregret> Cork: you mean $(comments).atry(..) right ?
[05:32:27] <Cork> anli: that is the only way to do it natively
[05:32:29] <anli> However, the value of size also seems to be ignored
[05:32:32] <Cork> noregret: no
[05:32:43] <Cork> noregret: comments is already a jquery object
[05:32:48] <Cork> no need to wrap it again
[05:33:23] <Cork> anli: the number for size should set how many "rows" it shows
[05:33:52] <anli> But I prefer to set the height of the selectbox to 100px
[05:34:08] <Cork> and that will override the effect of size
[05:34:20] <anli> Sure, but why is size needed then, its still ignored
[05:34:30] <anli> If I dont use it, I can only see one item
[05:34:33] <Cork> cause through size you set how many rows it should show
[05:35:03] <Cork> if you then define how high the element should be, and thereby hides some rows, is your problem :)
[05:35:10] <anli> Maybe I should be fine with setting size to 3 and height to whatever I want
[05:35:12] <soee> this channel supports jquery-ui ?
[05:35:17] <noregret> Cork: how can I deal with coments as a string here? since i'm appending it with other html strings and that's giving [objects]. e.g .append('html stuff' +  comments + 'other html stuff..et..')
[05:35:19] <anli> hehe
[05:35:25] <anli> soee: yes
[05:35:27] <Cork> anli: 2 should work too
[05:35:38] <anli> oh, I dont think that was possible, can try again
[05:35:52] <soee> guys is it possible to style placeholder when using sortable on table ?
[05:36:01] <anli> Too bad "multiple" is not also a valid value
[05:36:06] <Cork> noregret: $('<a/>').attr({ 'key': 'value' })
[05:36:08] <Cork> opps
[05:36:18] <Cork> noregret: $('<a/>').attr({ 'key': 'value', 'key': 'value' }).text(content);
[05:36:36] <Cork> noregret: that way you don't have to care :)
[05:37:49] <noregret> Cork: let me show what i got, it's a bit far with your sugesstion
[05:38:18] <noregret> Cork: http://bpaste.net/show/I2EdpBGPND7pjODHrr2d/
[05:38:20] <Cork> wb bot-t
[05:38:46] <noregret> Cork: im talking ahere about lines 47/48, note this function simply returns a string
[05:38:57] <noregret> Cork: and in other place, it is appeneded
[05:39:17] <Cork> noregret: you have to pick, either use strings or use dom
[05:39:28] <Cork> if you use strings, jquery can't help you much
[05:39:39] <Cork> and if you use dom, you need to do it all over the place
[05:39:46] <noregret> Cork: then can I return $(content) here and it will be fine
[05:40:30] <Cork> even if you have a dom its easy to add it where you want (.clone())
[05:40:42] <Cork> but ya, you can't use the code i gave you if you need it to be a string
[05:40:56] <noregret> hmm
[05:43:19] <noregret> Cork: so nothing at all can help me string-wise ?
[05:43:53] <Cork> noregret: you could use an extra dom element add our code to it and then serialize it
[05:44:24] <Cork> var container $('<div/>'); container.append($('<a/>').attr()); container.html()
[05:45:04] <Cork> though i find it kinda dumb to parse the html and then serialize it to straight away parse it again
[05:46:20] <noregret> Cork: where is that? in the function or where its return is appended ?
[05:46:41] <Cork> noregret: what do you mean?
[05:48:58] <noregret> Cork: the container you're talking about, is the one appending the returned results ?
[05:49:56] <spobat> hey
[05:50:09] <spobat> how can I make the green background box here stretch to the bottom? http://troubi.com/lab/lo/log.php?room=t
[05:52:06] <spobat> is this doable without jquery?
[05:53:02] <noregret> Cork: nevermind, comments = comments.get()[0].outerHTML; is good enough to get me a string
[06:06:05] <soee> how can i count cells in row before current row ?
[06:08:45] <omolio> hey, any short and creative ideas for this: http://pastie.org/7123549
[06:08:51] <Cork> soee: $(this).closest('tr').prev().find('td').length
[06:10:24] <hateIE> omolio a 2d array?
[06:10:42] <Cork> ?eval var filter = [true, true, false, true, false]; $.grep(['goat', 'cow', 'pig', 'horse', 'sheep'], function(i) { return filter[i]; });
[06:10:45] <bot-t> Cork: []
[06:10:56] <Cork> opps
[06:11:02] <Cork> ?eval var filter = [true, true, false, true, false]; $.grep(['goat', 'cow', 'pig', 'horse', 'sheep'], function(v, i) { return filter[i]; });
[06:11:04] <bot-t> Cork: ["goat", "cow", "horse"]
[06:11:16] <hateIE> epic

[06:11:53] <Cork> yes

[06:12:26] <Cork> (that is keep it in relation to questions, or for other situations in moderation)
[06:13:33] <hateIE> i got ya.. dont convert it into a flood bot with a privmsg payload worth of code
[06:13:44] <Cork> heh
[06:14:39] <Cork> hateIE: that reminded me when someone ran setInterval(function() { print('hello'); }, 500); in ##javascript :)
[06:14:54] <hateIE> lol
[06:14:55] <Cork> hateIE: became quite annoying after a few minutes :D
[06:15:09] <omolio> Cork: this is awesome! great approach
[06:15:14] <Cork> actually i think it was closer to 5000
[06:22:37] <wereHamster> is there a simple way to 'stream' the output from a browserify pipeline into a callback? Something like .pipe(function(output) { ... })? Or do I have to create a through stream myself and capture the output manually?
[06:23:26] <wereHamster> oh, wrong channel
[06:24:48] <gates_> Does on('pageshow, run on init load/
[06:32:31] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with this js; http://pastebin.com/8sbBJ2TG dunno how to "close" it
[06:32:43] <hateIE> can i try something out on bot-t.. little security test :)?
[06:33:27] <hateIE> it wont make it flood i promise.. x)
[06:37:37] <CodeMonkey_> Given the button: <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Fill Out Application">, can somone help me with the selector for that to bind to the click event? Due to policy issues, I can't change the code that generates that HTML, so I can't add a name or ID to the control.
[06:38:21] <Cork> $('form').submit(function() {});
[06:38:35] <Cork> CodeMonkey_: you should bind submit on the form, not click on the button
[06:39:17] <CodeMonkey_> Cork, I have to do some ajax validation, and I can't return true/false in ajax
[06:39:30] <Cork> CodeMonkey_: ok?
[06:39:48] <Cork> do the validation before you do the ajax call
[06:39:55] <Cork> and if it fails; don't do it
[06:40:07] <Cork> and then you can run event.preventDefault() all the time
[06:40:18] <CodeMonkey_> Cork, that's why I was binding to the click instead of submit
[06:40:33] <Cork> how is that an instead?
[06:40:36] <CodeMonkey_> and then I would call the ajax, and on success, do the submit
[06:40:46] <Cork> CodeMonkey_: click on submit is not the same as submit on the form
[06:41:21] <Cork> ex. hitting enter in a field will bypass your validation if you use click
[06:41:30] <Cork> (there is a number of other ways too)
[06:42:21] <CodeMonkey_> Cork... hmmm. Ok. I was using the form submit event, but ajax was failing. Let me mock it up in jsfiddle and see if you can help
[06:42:50] <Lianzinho> Hey guys, anyone with experience using history.js?

[06:43:03] <bot-t> Lianzinho, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:44:20] <Lianzinho> Well then, when I  hit the back button, which object will be passed as the data to the pushState function?
[06:45:14] <Cork> popState you mean?
[06:45:25] <Cork> pushState is what you use to add points in the history
[06:45:57] <Lianzinho> Cork: I mean the function pushState of the History.js plugin
[06:45:58] <pachet> yeah, history.back() will fire a popState event
[06:46:52] <CodeMonkey_> cork: http://jsfiddle.net/KEUut/ <- that's my base. I'm trying to call an ajax that will return and say if it's ok to continue or not based on their drop down selection. Can you show me the proper syntax?
[06:46:54] <Lianzinho> pachet: so, the data object should be the one that was last pushed, right?
[06:47:20] <pachet> no, the one before
[06:47:42] <Cork> Lianzinho: popState will give you the object that was passed to pushState when it created that entry
[06:47:44] <gates_> $(document).on('pageshow mobileinit', function (event, ui) { ... });
[06:47:46] <gates_> is this a valid bin?
[06:47:50] <gates_> bind*
[06:48:09] <Cork> Lianzinho: if pushState didn't create it, you don't get an object at all
[06:48:30] <Cork> (and if its not the first entry for the current page, you won't get an event at all)
[06:49:11] <Cork> CodeMonkey_: should it make a normal http post if its valid?
[06:49:20] <CodeMonkey_> Cork: yes
[06:49:40] <pachet> Cork: well in case a you get null
[06:49:46] <pachet> technically still an object ;)
[06:49:53] <Cork> lol
[06:49:54] <Cork> true
[06:50:32] <Lianzinho> Cork: hum, and are there any means to change this object?

[07:16:08] <spobat> is it with jquery somehow possible that I make separate rows selectable here?
[07:16:09] <spobat> http://troubi.com/lab/lo/untitled.html
[07:16:17] <spobat> I cannot change the html structure directly.
[07:16:35] <spobat> I want to mark any row, so that I only select "Item 1 Item 2"
[07:17:39] <spobat> i don't know if that's possible at all, but it would be really great!
[07:20:03] <edoc> spobt you must get item into array
[07:20:20] <spobat> what?
[07:20:21] <edoc> and work with these by   jquery .
[07:20:37] <gates_> Can I use "on" instead of "bind" for jQM's mobileinit?
[07:21:19] <edoc> you must populate an array with div required.
[07:22:05] <spobat> edoc, how do I do this?
[07:23:53] <Guest52801> A few questions for whoever's inclined to answer:
[07:23:53] <Guest52801> When compiling a website, I can use jQuery to insert premade java scripts?
[07:23:53] <Guest52801> Also would, for example:
[07:23:53] <Guest52801> http://plugins.jquery.com/justifiedgallery/
[07:23:53] <Guest52801> this plugin automatically adjust fields for a picture db and map them all according to my html code?
[07:24:23] <lastent> Hi, how can I know over what element is the mouse? do I have to bind the body?
[07:24:31] <Lianzinho_> so guys, my problem is that I need to replace the state inside of a 'statechange' event, and I end up falling in an infinite loop
[07:26:03] <pachet> just set a flag in the first loop, where you replace the state
[07:26:09] <pachet> then in the same handler, check for that flag
[07:26:13] <pachet> if it's flagged, do nothing
[07:27:15] <pachet> Guest52801: java scripts? no
[07:27:19] <pachet> javascript files? theoretically
[07:28:25] <Lianzinho_> pachet: nice, will try
[07:31:48] <rakl> I have a function wrapped in a document.ready function, but it seems like it's firing before the document is actually ready…
[07:31:53] <rakl> are there nuances I should know about?
[07:31:59] <rakl> I'm a beginner
[07:32:52] <rakl> this is what my code looks like http://pastie.org/7124730
[07:33:38] <rakl> sorry this: http://pastie.org/7124739
[07:33:59] <Clex> rakl: var initialize = function() {};
[07:34:11] <rakl> Clex sorry look at the 2nd one
[07:35:11] <rakl> in the initialize function i'm looking for a dom element and it's not finding it even though it's definitely in the dom
[07:35:43] <Clex> How do you search it?
[07:36:49] <rakl> ok, another update actually, when I console.log that element, it logs fine, but if I set a debugger in that function, it pauses when the dom isn't ready
[07:37:19] <pachet> what is your idea of 'ready'?
[07:37:24] <pachet> obviously jquery has a different idea
[07:37:29] <rakl> I'm guessing that because of the way I've defined the function it's compiling it?
[07:42:56] <Cork> rakl: ready is a wrapper function for DOMContentLoaded (with a fallback to load)
[07:43:11] <Cork> rakl: it fires when the browser has parsed the dom content
[07:43:12] <jokke> hi, i have a problem. i need to calculate the resulting height of not yet existing elements. What i'm trying to do: i have a page where a slider changes the content of a div. I need to calculate the maximum height of that div when loading the page so that everything fits and nothing on the page jumps around. You know what i mean? How can i do that? The contents are in an array.
[07:44:03] <Cork> jokke: you can't really calculate that
[07:44:16] <jokke> i was afraid you'd say that
[07:44:24] <Cork> you will have to calculate the dimentions of each element, an then add them up
[07:44:40] <Cork> when the browser does it, its called reflow
[07:44:40] <rakl> Cork I think my question is more of a js question than a dom ready thing. I think ready() is doing exactly what i think it is. thanks, i'll investigate more!
[07:44:52] <jokke> mmh
[07:45:00] <Cork> and its among the most expensive things a browser does when it renders a page
[07:45:08] <jokke> okay
[07:45:20] <jokke> damn
[07:45:30] <jokke> well i guess it haves to jump around then
[07:45:32] <Cork> rakl: so the question is function name() {} vs var name = function() {}; ?
[07:46:03] <Cork> jokke: collect the elements add them in one go, and before you end your function grab the dimetions
[07:46:05] <rakl> yeah. I know there's a difference, but not sure what it is, and not sure if it's affecting this
[07:46:31] <Cork> jokke: you can prevent jumping, you just have to either assume things or grab them before hand
[07:46:35] <jokke> Cork: you lost me thee
[07:46:38] <jokke> *there
[07:47:07] <Cork> jokke: reflow happens when the elements are added to the dom; that does NOT mean they are visible to the user yet
[07:47:20] <jokke> true

[07:47:26] <djQuery> how can I make this button show up on the same line as the input in jqm http://jsbin.com/ezafik/4/edit
[07:47:27] <pachet> bot-t wins that time
[07:47:29] <Cork> so if you add them to the dom and adjust things before paint happens it won't jump around
[07:47:46] <rakl> pachet thanks, I'll take a look at that!
[07:47:46] <Cork> jokke: one is a statement and one is a declaration
[07:47:54] <jokke> mh
[07:48:02] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[07:48:07] <Cork> rakl: ^
[07:48:42] <rakl> not sure what the difference between statement and declaration is either, but that's a good enough start
[07:48:48] <Cork> pachet: ah, nice link
[07:48:59] <jokke> Cork: still i'm not sure how i can calculate the height before paint happens..
[07:49:00] <Cork> rakl: they call it expression in that page
[07:49:08] <Cork> rakl: just read it it should explain it well
[07:49:22] <rakl> will do. they call what an expression? a statement or declaration?
[07:49:22] <Cork> jokke: you don't
[07:49:48] <Cork> statement and expression
[07:49:49] <jokke> okay, so how can i make sure then that the div stays the same height
[07:50:46] <Cork> jokke: either by setting a hight on the div befor adding things
[07:50:57] <jokke> Cork: that's assuming
[07:51:07] <Cork> or by ex. setting the highest number you get
[07:51:20] <Cork> so it just grows and never shrinks
[07:51:20] <jokke> huh?
[07:51:31] <jokke> ah
[07:51:42] <jokke> i see
[07:51:50] <jokke> so it jumps just in one direction :P
[07:51:51] <Lianzinho_> pachet: the flag strategy you told me. It won't work if I hit the back button, because this way, I want it to do the things of the loop
[07:52:01] <Cork> or if you have all the elements you can add them to the dom but not visible, then grab there sizes and set it
[07:53:29] <jokke> Cork: this last option.. assuming i add all my elements into the div and set them to be invisible. Wouldn't i get height = 0?
[07:54:08] <Cork> jokke: visibility: hidden
[07:54:22] <Cork> jokke: and it depends on how you hide them
[07:54:23] <jokke> and then i'm not sure how i would switch from showing one element to another
[07:54:50] <Cork> jokke: have a list of elements and move the elements your going to show
[07:55:07] <jokke> jeez..
[07:55:14] <jokke> that sounds overcomplicated
[07:55:24] <Cork> all you're really interested in is just to get a reflow of the elements so you can get there dimentions
[07:55:34] <Cork> theres a lot of ways to do that
[07:55:37] <jokke> yes
[07:55:53] <Cork> the question is generic so you will only get generic answers
[07:56:44] <Cork> but basically you can't know the dimensions of an element before reflow has touched it
[07:56:50] <jokke> just iterate through the elements, add them to the div which is set to visibility: hidden, calculate the height and replace by the next, compare height to previous, replace if bigger. like that?
[07:57:45] <Cork> jokke:  var container = $('<div/>').hide(); container.append([list, of, elements]);
[07:58:06] <Cork> then you just grab the dom element and append it where you want it when you want to use it
[07:58:34] <Cork> hmm no btw i think display: none affects the children too
[07:58:46] <Cork> overflow: hidden; height: 0, width: 0; then :)
[07:59:19] <djQuery> left: -5555px
[08:01:34] <djQuery> Cork, but I think these might break the :visible selector
[08:01:51] <AdamPDotty> "break2
[08:02:35] <LekeFly> How can i make sure only my li and the div gets targeted here: http://jsfiddle.net/TCvfB/ and not my entire site :D
[08:03:21] <djQuery> LekeFly, why not add a class to the lis you want to target
[08:03:46] <LekeFly> djQuery: i tried.. but failed :p
[08:04:22] <Cork> djQuery: i'm quite sure :visible only checks display:
[08:04:34] <djQuery> <li class="colorpickers" data-color="red">Red</li>
[08:04:53] <spobat> would this work?
[08:04:54] <spobat> $(activeRoom).removeClass('btn-*');
[08:05:00] <spobat> remove all classes that start with 'btn-'
[08:05:02] <djQuery> LekeFly,  <li class="colorpickers" data-color="red">Red</li>
[08:05:36] <LekeFly> i can keep the classes but the functions hides all divs
[08:06:49] <AdamPDotty> show() works
[08:06:53] <Lianzinho> hitting back fires any other event besides popstate?
[08:07:37] <djQuery> $(visibleClasses.join(''div.colors>div.")
[08:08:08] <Cork> Lianzinho: if its not a change triggered by pushState it trigger unload and beforeunload
[08:08:21] <Cork> djQuery: ''..." ??
[08:08:47] <djQuery> dunno just something I was thiking instead of his in loop
[08:09:00] <Cork> no i meant('<this>'div.colors>div.")
[08:09:04] <LekeFly> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/TCvfB/1/
[08:09:22] <Lianzinho> Cork: in the pushState case it's only popstate then?
[08:09:25] <LekeFly> Say i do something like that
[08:09:35] <Cork> yes
[08:11:20] <Cork> djQuery: you join starts with two single quotes and then the selector and a dubble quote
[08:11:21] <Lianzinho> Cork: I have a big problem, I need to scroll the page consistently when the user hits the back button, put it scrolls and a pushState is fired it must not scroll unless the user clicks in the menu
[08:12:14] <djQuery> Cork, yeah typo
[08:12:23] <Cork> Lianzinho: it most scroll but most not scroll?!?
[08:12:33] <Cork> Lianzinho: try rephrase that please...
[08:13:55] <LekeFly> http://jsfiddle.net/TCvfB/2/ anyone that could adjust the js for the html ? pretty please
[08:14:30] <AdamPDotty> $('.filter').find('".'+visibleClasses.join(', .')+'"').show();
[08:14:43] <brookQuint> Hello All, I'm tring to clone and add a TR to my Table. The TR has 2 Date_pickers in them that won't work when I do this. How do I initialize the new ones each time I add a new tr?
[08:15:28] <djQuery> LekeFly, somethign like this still working on it http://jsfiddle.net/TCvfB/3/
[08:15:28] <Lianzinho> Cork: it's a single page site... when the user scrolls manually, it must change the url each time it passes by a section. That's ok. But it must also scroll to an specific section when the user clicks its corresponding item in the menu. This  last scroll is animated. The problem is that it was being fired by the 'changestate' event, so, every time an user manually scroll past a section it would animate.
[08:16:17] <Lianzinho> Cork: I've handled this passing a parameter as the data on pushState function, the but now I need to make it animate scroll everytime the user hits the back button.
[08:17:05] <BobFunk> hey guys - if anybody would show some love to this new jQuery plugin on HN I would be happy :) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5443822
[08:17:19] <Cork> Lianzinho: if you prevent the default action when you click in the menu that should work by default
[08:18:00] <LekeFly> djQuery: Looks nice, not sure if i need multiple classes tho :D
[08:18:09] <Lianzinho> Cork: it's already prevented... I'm animating using ScrollTo plugin, I'll make a bin to show you
[08:18:25] <LekeFly> djQuery: a show all li would be epic tho
[08:19:04] <Cork> Lianzinho: what is it that triggers the popState event then?
[08:21:33] <djQuery> LekeFly, http://jsfiddle.net/TCvfB/4/
[08:22:27] <Lianzinho> Cork: take a look: http://pastebin.com/7Kqbsijw , the events are monitored by the 'changestate' event, I'm using History.js
[08:23:00] <LekeFly> djQuery: Hmm, now its "toggable" kinda right?
[08:23:14] <djQuery> LekeFly, sure
[08:23:37] <LekeFly> djQuery: How can i remove that tho? where are you located btw
[08:23:48] <djQuery> Dallas
[08:23:54] <djQuery> sorry remove what?
[08:25:08] <LekeFly> djQuery: I'm planing to use the "radio" function from here http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#buttons
[08:25:12] <Cork> Lianzinho: ok, and where does the menu come in here?
[08:25:15] <LekeFly> So it should not be possible to toggle
[08:25:53] <Lianzinho> Cork: //Handle Menu Click
[08:26:22] <Cork> Lianzinho: ya, i get that part, but what makes it trigger the changestate?
[08:26:27] <AdamPDotty> LekeFly: http://jsfiddle.net/fDyrR/
[08:26:42] <Lianzinho> Cork: pushState in the bottom...
[08:27:05] <djQuery> LekeFly, my example would be more inline with the checkbox
[08:27:11] <LekeFly> AdamPDotty: Would you mind adding a "all" button? :p i know i'm requesting alot here
[08:27:31] <LekeFly> djQuery: Yeah i saw
[08:27:32] <Cork> Lianzinho: pushState shouldn't trigger changestate
[08:27:38] <kiki67100> Hello
[08:27:56] <Lianzinho> Cork: 'statechange' ? hehehe
[08:28:14] <kiki67100> I use $.ajax for get Twitter info from the username but callback error not working when Twitter request are 404
[08:28:25] <Lianzinho> Cork: I guess it's history.js stuff
[08:28:47] <kiki67100> http://pastebin.com/mc8sTXuk
[08:29:17] <kiki67100> any idea ?
[08:30:36] <djQuery> LekeFly, http://jsfiddle.net/TCvfB/5/
[08:31:28] <LekeFly> djQuery: Woho! :-)
[08:31:34] <Cork> Lianzinho: no history binds it to the onpopstate event handler
[08:31:58] <Cork> Lianzinho: so its basically just a shim for the native feature
[08:32:15] <AdamPDotty> hmm, likme this: http://jsfiddle.net/fDyrR/1/
[08:33:13] <Lianzinho> Cork: I'm confused now... when I click in the menu, the callback is fired... what is happening then?
[08:33:57] <Lianzinho> Cork: I thought 'statechange' catches the change of the state made by pushState, doesn't it?
[08:34:15] <Jester86> Hey guys
[08:34:52] <Cork> Lianzinho: https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/blob/master/scripts/uncompressed/history.js#L1681
[08:34:57] <Jester86> I am having an extremely strange issue.   I have divs that I know contain .html="&nbsp; " yet the following jquery selector is returning 0
[08:34:57] <Jester86> $('#recurrenceScheduler').find('div[class=pattDiv]').find("div[class*='csg-FieldInput']:contains('&nbsp; ')").length;
[08:35:21] <Jester86> I know that it is grabbing the div's correctly.. just when I add :contains it goes to pot
[08:35:56] <Cork> Lianzinho: changestate is only triggered by either popstate or hashchange or an interval (if any of the first two doesn't exist)
[08:36:20] <djQuery> LekeFly, slight improvement http://jsfiddle.net/TCvfB/7/
[08:36:22] <Cork> Lianzinho: push should never trigger it
[08:37:03] <Jester86> djQuery, how goes it sir
[08:37:16] <djQuery> yo Jester86
[08:37:16] <spobat> I have to create thisi element in jquery, what would be the best way?
[08:37:16] <spobat> http://ideone.com/jPDsWt
[08:37:34] <Lianzinho> Cork: but History.pushState (with capital H) does that, https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/blob/master/scripts/uncompressed/history.js#L1739
[08:37:34] <Cork> Jester86: entities is expanded in the dom
[08:37:46] <Jester86> Cork please explain?
[08:38:09] <Changa> Hello, Open this page and keep refreshing. I used parallax.js to make the background but on some occasions the background starts off position. I cannot figure out what the problem is or how to fix it. page is -> http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/
[08:38:09] <Cork> Jester86: "&nbsp;" becoms " " in the dom
[08:38:19] <Cork> Lianzinho: damn, missed that
[08:38:44] <Cork> Lianzinho: and ... thats crazy!!
[08:38:48] <Jester86> Cork I don't think you understand my issue.
[08:39:00] <Lianzinho> Cork: hehehhe, in the good or bad way ?
[08:39:23] <Cork> Jester86: my point is contains('&nbsp; ') won't match anything cause there won't ever be any &nbsp; in the dom
[08:39:40] <Cork> Lianzinho:  in the really REALLY bad way
[08:39:59] <Jester86> Cork so why does .html() return '&nbsp; '
[08:40:01] <djQuery> Jester86, just pulled brisket outa the smoker
[08:40:16] <Jester86> djQuery.. rough day.  Working from home?
[08:40:27] <Cork> Jester86: cause its serialized back to a string
[08:40:34] <Lianzinho> Cork: why? The point of this plugin is simplify things, people often said it handles history API very well...
[08:41:02] <djQuery> Jester86, no just under employed
[08:41:05] <Cork> Jester86: if "  " wans't converted to "&nbsp; " when you read it one of the spaces would be removed by the parser
[08:41:16] <Cork> *re-add
[08:41:19] <Jester86> Cork well when I try to use ' ' in place of '&nbsp; ' it returns all of the div, not just those equal to ' '
[08:41:37] <Jester86> djQuery where do you live?
[08:41:53] <djQuery> dallas
[08:42:25] <Jester86> djQuery I thought the tech sector was doing well out there.
[08:42:42] <Jester86> We're always hiring here in NC ;)
[08:42:54] <djQuery> not if ur 44 with no degree
[08:43:07] <Cork> Jester86: anyway contains is horrible to what it needs to do, so i would recommend using a class instead (or if thats not possible, .filter() instead)
[08:43:28] <Jester86> Cork yeah I'm going to .filter
[08:43:56] <Jester86> But for sake of argument what makes .filter better than :contains
[08:44:20] <djQuery> spobat, have you looked at a templating engine knockout.js or similar
[08:47:42] <djQuery> Jester86, just about an .comand is better than any :comand
[08:51:28] <Lianzinho> Cork: so, I'm not bound in using History, just want to solve my problem. Do you have any idea? The main problem is, how to always animate the scroll when hitting back
[08:52:32] <Cork> Lianzinho: should work fine as long as it comes from popstate
[08:52:49] <kiki67100> Hello how can use error callback when i use json ?
[08:52:58] <kiki67100> to identify 404 http code ?
[08:53:19] <Cork> ?.ajax @ kiki67100
[08:53:20] <bot-t> kiki67100, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:53:27] <Cork> check the error section
[08:53:35] <kiki67100> Cork: I check
[08:53:48] <Lianzinho> Cork: so, I should make another callback and bind it to the original popstate event... Will try that...
[08:54:33] <rbennacer> hello
[08:54:37] <Cork> Lianzinho:  if you use history.js you can't as it actually triggers popstate
[08:54:56] <saba> Is it possible to retrieve the event data passed on as the third argument of .on() from outside of the event handler?
[08:54:58] <Cork> Lianzinho: and through that makes it impossible to detect if the page changes in or out :/
[08:55:08] <kiki67100> Cork: I see "This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests" it a cross domain request how can I called this event ?
[08:55:24] <Cork> saba: no
[08:55:27] <rbennacer> how can i find the first label in each form_footnote class?  doing something like this doesn't work $(".form_footnote").each( function(){ console.log($(this" label"))} );
[08:55:55] <Cork> kiki67100: ah, if its jsonp, and not json you have a lot less options
[08:56:09] <saba> Cork: there is no common method and no undocumented way that is unlikely to change?
[08:56:14] <amaroks> rbennacer: $(".form_footnote").find("label").first() i think
[08:56:38] <Cork> kiki67100: you can get an error response if the js script tag fails to load
[08:56:52] <Cork> kiki67100: but you can't special case the error type
[08:57:05] <jokke> can someone explain why $('#foo').html('bar'); $('#foo').html() returns undefined?
[08:57:38] <saba> I guess I have to bind another handler in some "uninstall event" instead :-).
[08:57:42] <rbennacer> amaroks, thnaks you
[08:57:43] <Cork> jokke: no, not if $ is jquery
[08:58:00] <rbennacer> amaroks, $(".form_footnote").find("label").each(...)
[08:58:21] <jokke> Cork: what do you mean?
[08:58:45] <Cork> jokke: $().html should never be undefined as long as $ is jquery
[08:58:59] <jokke> yes
[08:59:02] <jokke> weird huh
[08:59:23] <amaroks> rbennacer: whats you are trying to do this: $(".form_footnote label").each()
[08:59:37] <kiki67100> Cork: I will use php to do request is more easy
[08:59:56] <spobat>            
[09:05:23] <jokke> Cork: these lines https://paste.xinu.at/N3oWY/js
[09:05:51] <jokke> first alert shows the html perfectly well, the second shows undefinend and Height: null
[09:07:01] <Cork> jokke: and alert($('[id="cv-text"]').length); shows?
[09:07:15] <jokke> hm
[09:07:18] <jokke> lemme check
[09:07:48] <jokke> 0
[09:08:05] <jokke> so it doesnt exist
[09:08:07] <Cork> ok, so the id doesn't exist
[09:08:11] <Cork> nope
[09:08:27] <jokke> interesting
[09:08:36] <jokke> oh
[09:08:41] <jokke> face->desk
[09:08:51] <jokke> its class cv-text
[09:08:53] <jokke> not id
[09:08:56] <Cork> :D
[09:09:36] <Cork> jokke: ok so $('').html isn't undefined byt $('').html() is
[09:09:48] <Cork> interesting, guess i've never ended up in that situation
[09:10:34] <Changa> Hi, I have yet another problem I have been trying to solve... I used dropkick.js for my dropdown menu stylin but when I refresh the page it doesnt show up, when I click the adress bar and hit enter - it shows. What can be causing this? -> http://edizarca.com/karpaz/
[09:10:48] <jokke> Cork: yes seems so
[09:11:18] <MalMen> i have one event with onkeyup to get some data with get and put them on a table, but when users write very fast i got duplicate entries on table... there is anyone that know an  easy way to prevent that ?
[09:11:46] <NoiseEee> MalMen: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[09:14:35] <jokke> Cork: i solved the height calculation thing like this btw: https://paste.xinu.at/Ijl6V/js
[09:14:38] <jokke> works well
[09:15:18] <Cork> jokke: don't you get ssl warning from the links you generate?
[09:15:50] <jokke> ah nope
[09:15:54] <Cork> jokke: would prob replace .html('') with .empty()
[09:16:00] <jokke> ah good
[09:16:04] <jokke> i'll do that
[09:16:48] <Cork> jokke: no need to set visibility if you empty the element before your function ends
[09:16:55] <Cork> jokke: it won't trigger a rendering anyway
[09:17:05] <jokke> oh
[09:17:07] <jokke> ok
[09:17:14] <Cork> (browers only renders when js isn't running)
[09:17:22] <skione> hey, I am using jquery UI to load a form into a modal dialog but now I need to load the form dynamically and jqueryUI is throwing an error, I forget how but I think I have to specifically tell jqueryUI that the form was addedd
[09:17:45] <jokke> Cork: you're right
[09:18:27] <Cork> skione: whats the error?
[09:19:02] <skione> object has no method
[09:19:23] <Cork> skione: and how are you trying to load the form into the dialog?
[09:19:47] <skione> using .get and then .data
[09:20:02] <Cork> get and then data?
[09:20:07] <Cork> ?p @ skione
[09:20:08] <skione> yea
[09:20:08] <bot-t> skione, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:20:15] <skione> @Cork yes
[09:20:57] <skione> @Cork http://pastebin.com/jQrF99V8
[09:21:00] <Lianzinho> Cork: hum, mayme I could use the native replaceState, so it wont trigger popstate but the object will still change, what do you think?
[09:21:09] <Lianzinho> *maybe
[09:21:37] <skione> fyi I just changed the 'click()' to a 'live()'
[09:22:07] <Cork> skione: $("#dialog").data(data); is not a valid argument setup for data
[09:22:21] <Cork> and .data isn't magically used by dialog
[09:23:23] <Cork> skione: you should prob do something like $('
[09:23:25] <Cork> opps
[09:23:35] <Cork> skione: you should prob do something like $('#dialog').load('http://affinity2.myclient-review.com/form.php'); instead
[09:23:48] <Zepo> Hey Guys,simple Question. Have this 2 Selectbox and either if one change the other should swap his selection to the "null" value. I tryed with $("#sel").val("null"); but didn't wanted
[09:24:23] <Cork> Lianzinho: if you use replacestate you can't use back afterwards
[09:25:17] <Cork> skione: btw, live is not supported in 1.9
[09:25:29] <Cork> it was deprecated in 1.8, and is removed in 1.9
[09:25:32] <skione> really?
[09:25:38] <Lianzinho> Cork: damn... there is no other way to modify the current state object?
[09:25:40] <skione> is it just not needed anymore?
[09:25:58] <skione> I always thought it should "just work" since JQ adds things dynamically so much
[09:25:59] <Cork> skione: since 1.4 there has been a much better option in the tree
[09:26:22] <skione> which is?
[09:26:24] <Cork> skione: pre 1.7 its .delegate, and in newer ones its the delegate syntax on .on
[09:26:31] <skione> FYI, I have it working now
[09:26:40] <skione> ah delegate
[09:26:43] <skione> that was it
[09:26:44] <Cork> skione: live is a performance nightmare
[09:26:45] <skione> thanks!
[09:27:15] <Cork> skione: as $() will always try to search the dom, but .live always works on $(document)
[09:27:26] <skione> gotcha
[09:27:35] <Cork> skione: so that means every time you bind a live handler you search the dom and then throws away the matched elements
[09:27:43] <Cork> skione: and thats why delegate was invented
[09:27:51] <Cork> (and why live is now removed)
[09:28:03] <skione> ah
[09:28:27] <skione> I'll keep that in mind, I was out of pocket for a while as I was job hunting but I am finally back writing code again
[09:28:31] <skione> I am a little rusty
[09:28:41] <skione> amazing how much has changed in 5 months
[09:28:57] <Cork> skione: it haven't really changed in 5 months
[09:29:11] <skione> well I was using 1.4 prior to this gig
[09:29:21] <Cork> its just that A LOT of ppl never cared to look through what live did, and check for the better alternative
[09:29:43] <Cork> so many didn't move away from live until it wasn't supported at all anymore
[09:29:58] <skione> nothing like removing a function to make people learn something new
[09:30:05] <Cork> :)
[09:30:27] <skione> I did actually use delegate before but I had used live much more hence why I was trying it
[09:30:29] <Cork> my argument has actually always been that live should never had landed in jquery
[09:30:37] <skione> I never liked it actually
[09:30:55] <skione> I always thought jquery should recognize dynamically added elements without doing anything special
[09:31:03] <skione> but I am sure there was a reason why that was not the case
[09:31:13] <Cork> what i liked least with live was that it did't show to the developer what was going on
[09:31:25] <Cork> so it tricked them into thinking it wasn't expensive
[09:31:51] <Cork> skione: well if you always bind on document and always use the delegate syntax, you will get that
[09:31:59] <skione> so few developers ever gave JQ a eye from a performance perspective as they usually were like "look how cool it is?"
[09:32:08] * skione guilty of that too
[09:32:08] <Cork> skione: the none dynamic behavior is just cause thats how events work in dom
[09:32:25] <skione> yeah like I said, I am sure there was a reason
[09:32:33] <boulet101010> hi, when writing a jquery plugin, do i need to write jQuery.fn.myClass.prototype to define my prototype, or myClass.prototype is enough?
[09:32:46] <skione> anyway Cork, thanks again, you set me straight
[09:32:51] * skione need lunch
[09:33:04] <hateIE> hm this random color fade function has not gone well :(
[09:33:11] <Cork> skione: when you run $('#target').on('click', function() {}); what jquery does is document.getElementById('target').addEventListener('click')
[09:33:33] <Cork> skione: and if the element matching the id/selector doesn't exist, you can't add an event listener to it
[09:33:36] <skione> right I always forget JQ is a library for JS
[09:34:09] <Cork> boulet101010: no you can't use prototypes in the plugin
[09:34:18] <hateIE> any sugestions for a function that will randomly fade the font color of a span periodically
[09:34:18] <Cork> or at least you shouldn't
[09:34:37] <hateIE> fade to a new font color evne
[09:35:01] <hateIE> new and random! god dam it jim it must be random ;/
[09:35:07] <Cork> boulet101010: best solution is to have an internal object add you functions to it, and then have a front function accessing the object like .myPlugin('function', arguments)
[09:36:35] <Cork> hateIE: why do you need a plugin for something that simple?
[09:36:52] <boulet101010> Cork, http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/ is the lightweight start a good way to do it?
[09:38:38] <Cork> boulet101010: just through skimming it i would say no, but as i've never read that page i can't say for sure
[09:39:00] <Cork> but as far as i can tell it doesn't look like it actually creates the wrapper i talked about
[09:39:37] <boulet101010> Cork, ok i'm gonna try to write something
[09:40:09] <spobat> how can I do this with .each?
[09:40:13] <spobat> http://ideone.com/RIoEdt
[09:40:28] <spobat> I really tried it but it never worked correctly :S
[09:41:33] <Cork> sigh, why do everyone keep using these dead code pages...
[09:41:50] <goddard> with my ajax can i make it post the variables instead of get
[09:42:09] <systemfault> spobat: chat.children().each(function() { var children = $(this).children();….. }); ?
[09:42:28] <spobat> ah, I tried it with chat.each
[09:42:30] <Cork> goddard: $.post or $.ajax({ type: 'post' })
[09:42:30] <systemfault> goddard: Sure, see the type config option
[09:42:47] <spobat> i thought it was "each children"
[09:42:56] <Cork> spobat: i meant use jsfiddle, jsbin or any of the other ones that can be modified
[09:43:04] <spobat> k
[09:44:40] <Cork> spobat: http://jsfiddle.net/gXD3Q/
[09:44:43] <Cork> that should work
[09:44:49] <spobat> yep it works :D
[09:44:55] <spobat> thank you
[09:45:04] <Cork> np
[09:45:18] <Cork> oh...
[09:45:23] <Cork> can actually be cleaned up a bit more
[09:45:54] <Cork> spobat: http://jsfiddle.net/gXD3Q/1/
[09:47:33] <spobat> Cork, here these 2 are different: http://jsfiddle.net/gXD3Q/2/
[09:48:07] <Cork> spobat: they are, but they should do the same thing
[09:48:31] <Cork> or did you mean something else?
[09:49:21] <spobat> Cork no I meant that this short version looks really godly, but it doesn't work :S
[09:49:43] <Cork> spobat: what doesn't work with it?
[09:50:18] <Cork> spobat: could you add the needed html to the html section so we could see it working?
[09:51:57] <goddard> Cork: thanks cork
[09:52:03] <goddard> systemfault: thanks
[09:52:14] <goddard> forgot about that
[09:55:33] <spobat> well I see it's fine :S
[09:55:34] <spobat> :D
[09:55:57] <Cork> what?
[09:56:10] <spobat> it works
[09:56:14] <Cork> :)
[09:57:36] <guy> $('input[pattern]').each(function () { console.log( $(this).attr('pattern') ); }); return undefined, where pattern is \d*
[09:57:55] <masentinel900> Good afternoon guys!!
[09:58:11] <masentinel900> I need to know if someone has worked with pines notify plugin?
[09:58:20] <Cork> guy: \d* isn't a valid attribute name
[09:58:34] <spobat> by the way, is there a better way of doing this? http://ideone.com/iJ5k3d
[09:58:41] <guy> Cork: I meant value, pattern="\d*"
[09:59:15] <Cork> you mean <input pattern="\d*"> ?
[09:59:22] <Cork> hmm
[09:59:44] <Cork> ah
[10:00:03] <guy> yup.
[10:00:13] <guy> ups.
[10:00:19] <guy> my bad. $('input[pattern]').each(function () { console.log( this );
[10:00:29] <Cork> :)
[10:00:30] <guy> I mistaken what the context is
[10:01:17] <guy> though, huh. shouldn't this be the input?
[10:02:17] <guy> nevermind. It is my bad.
[10:02:36] <guy> https://gist.github.com/gajus/b47c49694beb86215bef
[10:02:41] <guy> stupid mistake
[10:03:17] <kelye> hi, http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-helper it's not specified in the docs but that function receives the event as argument .. is is safe to use that ? might be just a documentation issue ?
[10:03:46] <Cork> guy: i wold not recommend binding events like that
[10:04:10] <Cork> guy: bind a delegated event listener instead and do the regex there
[10:04:12] <guy> there is a reason for that. I don't mind pasting the code when I am done.
[10:04:22] <guy> Cork: building regex object is kinda heavy.
[10:04:45] <Cork> guy: not to the point that it matters if you bind it on keyup
[10:04:54] <guy> hm. really?
[10:05:17] <benjick> This might be a little too specific, but I'm looking for an audio player which just finds the next song in HTML so I can add songs with blogposts then have some sort of endless scroll
[10:05:18] <Cork> and honestly not to the point that it matters at all actually
[10:05:20] <guy> I would think the otherwise.. if you use this on every input, especially in a website with intensive input.
[10:05:33] <guy> well, less work for me. : )
[10:05:45] <Cork> guy: but it only triggers after a user presses a key
[10:05:52] <Cork> and then its only on that specific element
[10:05:54] <Cork> not all of them
[10:06:24] <Cork> doing the attribute selector is a harder task for the browser :)
[10:12:22] <hateIE> http://jsfiddle.net/WpHH6/4/ <--- this is so fail
[10:12:58] <DeltaHeavy> Is there anyway to have jQuery do what I'm trying to do with this line of code: $(this + ' > .someclass')    ?
[10:13:24] <Cork> hateIE: uh...
[10:13:28] <systemfault> $(this).find(' > .someclass') ?
[10:13:51] <Cork> hateIE: why don't you just generate a 6 hex value from random and be done with it?
[10:13:55] <DeltaHeavy> systemfault: Thanks!

[10:15:19] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/Gz8qM/ - extending jqGrid to add a custom variable, but it isn't there if I get the grid element again

[10:16:15] <Cork> hateIE: ^
[10:16:31] <hateIE> i see much less convoluted indeed
[10:16:48] <ajpiano> Andrew_R: you need to use .data() for saving information like that
[10:16:55] <ajpiano> individual jquery objects are transient
[10:17:13] <ajpiano> $grid.data("lastEditId", rowid);
[10:17:21] <ajpiano> $grid.data("lastEditId");
[10:17:27] <ajpiano> ?data @ Andrew_R
[10:17:27] <bot-t> Andrew_R, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/

[10:23:12] <ajpiano> sweet
[10:26:04] <digs> oh. shezzz.. I forgot to truncate the time off the date... it works now :/
[10:26:11] <digs> disregard my non-sense.
[10:26:29] <RedXIII> If I use a selector to change the 'src' attrib of an <img>, does the browser still send If-Modified-Since?

[10:34:25] <Cork> !function($) { }(jQuery); is
[10:34:37] <spobat> what?

I am trying to constrain the movement of the image so that edges never go inside the edge of the div, if that makes sense. I cant use contrain parent, because the image is larger then the div
[10:42:27] <velts> if you have an array of divs such as, ['<div class="one" />', '<div class="two" />', '<div class="one" />', '<div class="three" />'] , which can be in any order, and you wanted to get a subset of three items without remove any divs with class one, how would you do that?
[10:42:46] <hateIE> http://jsfiddle.net/WpHH6/13/ <-- the smoothy
[10:42:49] <velts> both, ['<div class="one" />', '<div class="one" />', '<div class="three" />'] and ['<div class="one" />', '<div class="two" />', '<div class="one" />'] are ok

[10:45:51] <vinex08> <Andrew_R>: i just copied the code.. actually with the same id name and classes...
[10:46:04] <Andrew_R> or the way you have it, just move that code up to the jQuery(document).ready function
[10:46:05] <vinex08> why is that the other one is working, and mine doesn;t
[10:46:32] <vinex08> ill try
[10:48:09] <vinex08> i moved it in diff. places,, no luck

[10:50:51] <Andrew_R> hmm
[10:50:51] <velts> is .sort native javascript?
[10:51:40] <vinex08> <Andrew_R>: still doesn't work
[10:51:41] <abjorn> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort

[10:55:00] <anew> anyone help on that ajax ?
[10:55:57] <Andrew_R> `doesn't work

[10:56:13] <Andrew_R> anew: what do you mean? what happens?
[10:56:23] <anew> i just dont get a response
[10:56:30] <anew> if i have /authenticaion/login
[10:56:31] <anew> as the url
[10:56:32] <anew> it works
[10:56:35] <anew> but when i add the https it doesnt
[10:57:15] <anew> hmm ok the url sending has to be https also
[10:57:26] <geoous> when I declare an 'el' with backbone that wraps all my code and would like make some jquery outside the Backbone.View why it doesnt work?
[10:58:09] <anew> shouldnt you go to a backbone room and ask that
[10:58:34] <anew> plus why are you doing jq outside the backbone view with el
[10:58:42] <anew> the point of modular coding is to keep it all inside the view
[10:58:52] <shoky> anew: sounds like a SOP (same-origin policy) issue
[10:59:05] <anew> yeah that's what it is

[11:01:50] <shoky> rainabba_:  $.grep returns a plain array
[11:02:24] <shoky> rainabba_: you can't  .each  it  . unless you're using some lib that adds .each to arrays
[11:02:37] <shoky> you can .forEach it, tho
[11:02:41] <shoky> or $.each it

[11:48:41] <rainabba_> shoky: Got that issue squared away. Thank you.
[11:52:55] <Andrew_R> vinex08: you're going to have to copy your $('#largeImage').addpowerzoom() code and put it inside the $('#thumb').delegate function
[11:53:13] <Andrew_R> that should reload the changed image into the zoom
[11:57:24] <geoous> $('#Window').animate({width: 'toggle'})
[11:57:40] <geoous> when i click on it the animation doesnt stop
[11:57:50] <geoous> it makes animation 3x instead of one.
[11:58:32] <Andrew_R> toggle isn't a valid CSS property for width
[11:58:41] <Andrew_R> do you want #('#Window').stop() ?
[11:59:15] <Andrew_R> ? stop
[11:59:16] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[12:00:34] <geoous> didn't work anywa
[12:02:22] <hateIE> is there some sort of debug mode i can turn on to see further info about animate
[12:02:45] <hateIE> our fiddle seems to not be working inside my foundation template
[12:05:16] <Andrew_R> hateIE: you can pass a second parameter to animate, a "step callback function" where you could do a Console.Log() of your current values
[12:05:35] <Andrew_R> http://api.jquery.com/animate/#step
[12:06:49] <hateIE> ok so you know, jquery ui 10 and jquery 1.9.1 are included i removed some other conflicting jquery inclusions from foundation but animate persists to fail! so im thinking that zurb might have a conflict .. i also noticed that on the jquery.com examples that to use animate they do not include jquery ui which i tried to remove as well and does not change my situation
[12:07:19] <Andrew_R> jqueryUI is needed for your color animation
[12:07:27] <Andrew_R> do you get any errors in console?
[12:07:34] <hateIE> nothing
[12:14:08] <hateIE> aha
[12:14:20] <hateIE> this is what the step callback is saying
[12:14:22] <hateIE> color: NaNrgb(71, 181, 255)
[12:16:01] <Andrew_R> haha
[12:19:07] <defaultr0> hi folks, in Firefox, it appears like this. dd class="nm_satellite"  in IE, it appears like this, class="ovi_mp_satellite. I need to have a click event. How should I call it?
[12:20:02] <defaultr0> I don't want to have 2 separate clicks for them
[12:20:47] <Andrew_R> defaultr0: why would you have two different classes depending on browser?
[12:21:04] <defaultr0> that's what i'm really wondering why it's happening
[12:21:14] <defaultr0> it's actually an external api that we call
[12:22:00] <Andrew_R> that's even stranger then, because the external api shouldn't even know about which browser you are using
[12:23:42] <djQuery> dang how to get the minus button to float right without dropping down like that http://jsbin.com/ezafik/5/edit
[12:32:50] <defaultr0> is wildcard supported in id or classes when we call them? example $('.*_satellite').click(......
[12:34:21] <djQuery> defaultr0, not like that but is in attribute selector
[12:35:02] <djQuery> defaultr0, http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[12:35:02] <Andrew_R> $('[class$=_satellite]')
[12:35:49] <defaultr0> awesome!!!
[12:35:59] <djQuery> defaultr0, but SLOW
[12:36:28] <defaultr0> oh
[12:36:38] <defaultr0> any other solutions?
[12:36:44] <defaultr0> is it really very slow?
[12:37:18] <Andrew_R> I think $('[class$=_satellite]') could fail if you have multiple classes and the last one doesn't end with _satellite
[12:37:22] <djQuery> well the $= won't work if you have more than 1 class in it unless satellite happens to be the last class
[12:37:46] <defaultr0> k
[12:37:52] <djQuery> <a class="satellite something_satellite">
[12:38:09] <defaultr0> yeah, I see other values there
[12:38:48] <Andrew_R> same with *= if you have <a class="this_satellite_isnt_wanted">
[12:38:59] <djQuery> $('.satillite').filter('[class*='somethingelse'])
[12:39:57] <djQuery> something_satillite should also have just plain satillite so that you can first filter on .satillite
[12:40:06] <djQuery> that would help the speed immensly
[12:40:26] <djQuery> also have you thought about adding a data attribute to filter on instead
[12:41:11] <Andrew_R> djQuery: I think he is working with HTML from a 3rd party that gets inserted into his document somehow
[12:41:29] <djQuery> <a class="something satilite" data-sat="whatever">   $('.satillite').filter('[data-sat=whatever]')
[12:42:03] <djQuery> Andrew_R, bugger
[12:43:26] <djQuery> defaultr0, ^^^^
[12:44:33] <defaultr0> yup
[12:44:43] <defaultr0> I'll try that
[12:44:44] <defaultr0> thanks
[12:45:01] <thin> how can i check if a $('.selector') didn't find any elements?
[12:45:27] <BillCriswell> thin: Check the lenght.
[12:45:30] <BillCriswell> length*
[12:45:32] <Andrew_R> $('.selector').length will be 0 if no matches
[12:47:50] <thin> thanks
[12:48:11] <thin> will $(window).load( myfunc ); wait until after images have loaded?
[12:48:59] <Andrew_R> yes, but load $(window).load(function) is depreciated
[12:49:08] <Andrew_R> better to use $(window).on('load', function)
[12:49:15] <thin> ok thanks
[12:54:04] <defaultr0> Here is the complete code in IE, <LI class="ovi_mp_satellite ovi_mp_active" isEventTarget="true" draggable="false" sizcache="9" sizset="64"><A href="javascript:void(0);">Satellite</A><SPAN class=ovi_mp_hidden>Satellite</SPAN></LI>
[12:54:26] <defaultr0> then in Firefox, here is the complete, <dd class="nm_satellite" tabindex="-1" aria-role="menuitemradio" draggable="false" aria-checked="true"><span class="nm_secondBG">Satellite</span><span class="nm_icon">⌘</span></dd>
[12:54:30] <defaultr0> quite different
[12:54:49] <djQuery> dd not supported in ie?
[12:55:05] <defaultr0> it's not from our code
[12:55:12] <defaultr0> it's from an outside api
[12:56:15] <defaultr0> maybe just use the string Satellite value?
[12:56:38] <Andrew_R> what is it you are trying to select in each set?
[12:56:44] <defaultr0> it's a button
[12:57:00] <djQuery> so are they clicking on the button?
[12:57:04] <defaultr0> yes
[12:57:12] <defaultr0> but it doesn't say it's a button
[12:57:17] <djQuery> and this li is the button they are clicking on
[12:57:20] <defaultr0> yes
[12:57:35] <defaultr0> this is what i have which works in Firefox, $('dd.nm_satellite').click(function(){
[12:57:36] <djQuery> is the click bound to the a or the li
[12:57:45] <defaultr0> I added the click
[12:57:48] <defaultr0> it's a new code
[12:58:01] <defaultr0> i would like tthe click to also work in IE
[12:58:46] <Andrew_R> just do two selectors, like $('li.ovi_mp_satellite, dd.nm_satellite').click(function)
[12:58:49] <djQuery> $('dd.nm_satellite, li.ovi_mp_satellite  ').click(function(){
[12:59:02] <defaultr0> k, trying
[12:59:03] <Andrew_R> djQuery: high-five :p
[12:59:07] <defaultr0> :)
[12:59:20] <defaultr0> that's what I have just separate lines
[12:59:26] <defaultr0> i thought it was not possible to combine them
[13:00:35] <djQuery> depends on if you need to know which one they clicked on
[13:01:48] <djQuery> defaultr0, like I don't see this info anywhere in the dd sizcache="9" sizset="64"
[13:02:24] <defaultr0> i got lost there
[13:02:34] <defaultr0> what do you mean?
[13:02:46] <djQuery> defaultr0, what happens when they click on the button?
[13:02:55] <defaultr0> it calls a different map
[13:03:19] <djQuery> what info in the dd or li tells it what map to call or is it static?
[13:04:20] <djQuery> how can I get these jqm delete buttons to float right correctly  http://jsbin.com/ezafik/5/edit
[13:06:50] <hateIE> had to replace animate with --> http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[13:07:20] <djQuery> hateIE, ?ui.color
[13:07:26] <djQuery> ?ui.color
[13:07:36] <djQuery> `api ui.color
[13:07:36] <b-ot> djQuery: No matches.
[13:08:04] <djQuery> stupid lazy bots http://jqueryui.com/animate/
[13:23:32] <Andrew_R> djQuery: it looks correct when you push the + button
[13:24:13] <Andrew_R> use firebug to pull the HTML from the label and use that?
[13:24:34] <hateIE10> djQuery i dont know why but it wont work with out.. that is the same version i have included
[13:27:33] <brombomb-w> I'm trying to overwrite the _setOptions in a jquery widget, but can't figure out how to call the built-in setOptions in jquery 1.8
[13:27:54] <djQuery>   brombomb-w super
[13:28:01] <brombomb-w> super is 1.9+
[13:28:04] <brombomb-w> I thought
[13:28:19] <djQuery> yes sorry didnt catch that part
[13:28:29] <brombomb-w> no problem :)
[13:28:44] <brombomb-w> I can write the loop myself... just would be nice to do it "correctly"
[13:32:01] <djQuery> brombomb-w, here is I had to do it when I inherited from the dialog $.ui.dialog.protype.setoption.call(key, value);
[13:32:14] <masentinel900> Guys!!!
[13:32:35] <masentinel900> I put  this :  $("#datePicker").datepicker();
[13:32:39] <brombomb-w> When doing a setOption I do: $.Widget.prototype._setOption.apply(this,arguments);  but I want to do this in setOptions
[13:33:12] <masentinel900> For may to use the datepicker natively on jquery but show me .datepicker() is not a function?
[13:33:13] <brombomb-w> djQuery: looks like you're doing that in setOption not setOptions correct?
[13:33:14] <masentinel900> why
[13:33:44] <djQuery> $.Widget.prototype._setOptions.apply(this,options)
[13:35:53] <brombomb-w> doesn't work djQuery
[13:35:58] <brombomb-w> tried that ;)

[13:47:50] <lastent> Hi, is there any unique identifier for each element? I mean, do the elements have any kind of hash identifier that I could use to identify an element that doesn't have an id?
[13:48:48] <ashgotti> Can someone please help me with this jQuery function? http://pastebin.com/zG7SPADM I'm not sure where to put it.
[13:48:48] <ashgotti> I'm trying to install this on a wordpress site, which I've done in the past without an issue but the theme I'm using now is giving me issues: http://www.bjornblog.com/web/jquery-store-locator-plugin
[13:51:17] <djQuery> ashgotti, are any of the examples listed there using word press?
[13:52:14] <ashgotti> djQuery, no but I have done it recently. THe issue I have is that the theme I'm using uses a different jQuery than the plugin requires. I call the version it requires on the page but I believe this is causing a conflict. In Chrome's dev tools, I don't see any errors
[13:52:45] <ashgotti> http://mrgas.grassrootonline.com/locations/# That's the page

[13:56:57] <plato> hi guys, I am having trouble getting my success callback to execute on a $.getJSON() call
[13:57:56] <plato> I am sending an empty HTTP 200 OK response
[13:58:13] <jedimind> well don't do that
[13:58:16] <plato> Now I realize that content-type is text/plain - does Jquery consider this a failure?
[13:59:20] <plato> Yeah i guess that was it... its working now that I set the content type to application/json
[14:00:58] <plato> Can I file a bug report for that soewhere? Or is there a procedure where I can contribute to the documentation at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ ? cause it nowhere there says that 'success' is contingent upon response content-type
[14:02:13] <tripflex> jQuery('.mydiv').hover(function($) { $(this).tooltip('show'); });
[14:02:23] <tripflex> is passing $ in function not enough?
[14:02:45] <tripflex> i thought in the past this is how i got it to work instead of using function(){
[14:04:46] <rmill> alligator

[14:08:51] <bet0x> Hello all, i got an post with ajax where i do show the result (input via textbox) and it works, but now i want to print the result inside a textbox! how i do that? coz this doesn't work for my second textbox:  $('#display').html(data.returnValue);
[14:09:26] <tripflex> .attr() maybe?
[14:10:36] <bet0x> can yuo expand?
[14:11:34] <tripflex> just a sec
[14:11:39] <tripflex> i did this once
[14:11:46] <tripflex> for generating links in an input box
[14:11:53] <tripflex> ah
[14:11:55] <tripflex> .val
[14:13:35] <bet0x> $('input#slug').val(data.returnValue);
[14:13:37] <bet0x> like that?
[14:13:43] <tripflex> yeah probably
[14:15:11] <tripflex> no need for input
[14:15:23] <tripflex> if the ID is slug for the input
[14:15:32] <tripflex> $('#slug').val
[14:16:06] <bet0x> it worked with this $('input#slug').val(data.returnValue);
[14:16:20] <tripflex> yeah youre just selecting input with id slug
[14:16:31] <tripflex> isnt necessary if you dont have any other id's named slug
[14:16:49] <tripflex> thats just the selector
[14:16:58] <tripflex> so it selects all id's with slug
[14:17:11] <tripflex> using input specifies ... use any input with the ID slug
[14:17:13] <tripflex> :P
[14:17:22] <bet0x> so is PROPER to use input#slug even if i do have only 1
[14:17:28] <bet0x> to avoid search in the whole document
[14:17:29] <bet0x> right?
[14:17:37] <tripflex> i dunno i'm still learning myself :P
[14:17:42] <bet0x> as me XD
[14:17:45] <maskio> how do i set my ajax call to return a pdf mime type so that on response it will download the pdf file?
[14:18:01] <tripflex> maskio, good luck
[14:18:02] <bet0x> force the file type
[14:18:09] <dcherman> bet0x: IDs should be globally unique, so you should just use $( "#slug" )
[14:18:13] <maskio> im using tcpdf to create the pdf file
[14:18:14] <maskio> T_T
[14:18:19] <tripflex> i've had problems trying to do that with excel file
[14:18:34] <tripflex> there's a script out there on the net that will handle it for you
[14:18:43] <tripflex> just search ajax download file or something
[14:18:49] <bet0x> maskio header('Content-Type: application/pdf');
[14:18:57] <bet0x> on the php
[14:19:15] <maskio> bet0x: thanks i will try

[14:26:38] <Raydiation1> is there a lib/plugin that lets you add new fields to an option dropdown?
[14:29:48] <Suzaku> is there a way to catch keypress only in the body and not for example within an SWF/object ?
[14:30:29] <Raydiation1> Suzaku: event.stopPropagation() iirc
[14:30:36] <Raydiation1> when you click on the swf
[14:30:45] <Suzaku> oh right
[14:30:48] <Suzaku> let's try :>
[14:31:21] <Suzaku> thanks~
[14:38:18] <shoelessone> perhaps a bit of a long shot, but does anybody have a recomendation for an iOS friendly (ie you can swipe on the iphone/ipad) full width slider plugin?

[14:38:47] <shoelessone> continuous*
[14:39:45] <StephenS> how can I on end of scroll page add auto event to call ajax script to load content?
[14:40:30] <StephenS> ?scroll
[14:40:31] <bot-t> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[14:41:08] <StephenS> hmm how with scroll to know when its end of scrolling?
[14:41:10] <Suzaku> Raydiation1: hmm should I put the stopPropagation on the .focus() handler?
[14:41:42] <StephenS> ah window. lemme try
[14:42:10] <Raydiation1> Suzaku: no, bind a click handler on the swf event and do it in there
[14:42:20] <Raydiation1> ehm
[14:42:28] <Raydiation1> keyup*
[14:43:46] <maskio> how do i set an ajax call to open a new window passing my get values?
[14:44:07] <Suzaku> for all the keys i have handlers for outside of the swf?
[14:44:43] <BryanRuiz> maskio: why would you need to open a new window with ajax?
[14:45:19] <BryanRuiz> why not just a link
[14:45:25] <maskio> BryanRuiz: what would be the best approach?
[14:45:44] <nickmeagher> I am having some issues with jQuery slideToggle()

[14:46:28] <nickmeagher> When you click on one of the top nav links a drop down slides down but the top carrot doesn't show until the animation is complete, does anyone know why??
[14:46:31] <BryanRuiz> maskio: a link with <a href="your_page.html?GET=PARAMS" target="_blank">link</a>
[14:47:02] <maskio> BryanRuiz: ok i try, thanks
[14:47:59] <maskio> BryanRuiz: uhm, how would i do that on a button?
[14:48:04] <nickmeagher> anyone?
[14:48:54] <BryanRuiz> maskio: i would style the a href as a button, but if you have to use a button, you can attach a click handler to it
[14:49:33] <Che-Anarc> Is there any way to set page popup size's in jQM? I am doing :   <div data-role="page" id="popup">   but inline style width or .class has no effect.

[15:05:03] <agu10^> hello! why doesn't the scroll event fire when scrolling using the scrollbar on chrome?
[15:05:23] <agu10^> It fires when pressing the keys or scrolling with the mousewheel, but not with the scrollbar
[15:05:51] <agu10^> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9535762/web%20design/potentialstudio.com%20new/index.html
[15:06:04] <agu10^> Look at the console output. It prints 'a' when it fires the event.
[15:06:23] <agu10^> $('html,body').bind("scroll DOMMouseScroll mousewheel keyup keydown", function(e){console.log('a'); }
[15:06:46] <agu10^> But it does not fire when using the scrollbar on the right.
[15:14:01] <shoky> agu10^: you need to bind to the window element for that
[15:14:42] <Suzaku> anyone have an idea how to prevent keypress events within an swf / embed tag
[15:14:43] <agu10^> shoky, are you sure?
[15:14:57] <Suzaku> i can't even get a simple hover event over the swf to work, it just simply doesn't register
[15:15:22] <agu10^> It does not work.
[15:15:32] <shoky> agu10^ works for me..
[15:15:36] <shoky> on your page
[15:15:49] <agu10^> shoky, it doesn't work for me on windows 8, chrome 25.
[15:16:01] <agu10^> i heard for other people it worked right away with no changes, also on chrome
[15:16:07] <agu10^> so it should be a bug in chrome?
[15:16:21] <shoky> dont think so
[15:17:00] <shoky> agu10^: that's not how you bind to the window
[15:17:09] <shoky> sorry i said "window element"
[15:17:26] <shoky> $(window).bind('scroll', ...
[15:17:27] <agu10^> yes yes. bind(html,body,window)
[15:17:34] <agu10^> oops i meant
[15:17:43] <agu10^>  $('html,body,window').bind
[15:17:46] <agu10^> still doesn't work.
[15:17:50] <shoky> that's now how you do it
[15:17:56] <shoky> window is not an element you can select with jquery
[15:18:04] <agu10^> ohh, kay
[15:18:09] <shoky> $(window).bind(
[15:18:13] <shoky> no quotes
[15:18:55] <agu10^> it works now for some reason
[15:19:05] <agu10^> why was the previous example using 'body,html' ?
[15:20:38] <Suzaku> how to prevent keypresses within an SWF from propagating to their handlers outside the SWF?
[15:20:55] <Suzaku> (so how to prevent them when the swf is focussed only)
[15:28:42] <agu10^> Hey guys, I would like to translate my website to spanish easily, but being able to have the SAME design and code for both. What do you suggest?
[15:29:56] <agu10^> I was thinking of having 2 <span lang='en'>something</span><span lang='es'>algo</span> and show/hide each using javascript, when selecting a language. What do you think?
[15:31:04] <Changa> a bit of  a dumb question here: On this form - how do I alert the data coming back so I see what's echoed back from the php? or the data is passing on is something else? -> http://edizarca.com/karpaz/
[15:32:25] <Andrew_R> agu10^: you don't want to do this with Javascript
[15:32:28] <Andrew_R> do it client side
[15:32:39] <Andrew_R> oops
[15:32:41] <agu10^> why not? javascript is client side
[15:32:41] <Andrew_R> server side I meant
[15:32:49] <agu10^> Yes, i will use node.js anyways
[15:33:10] <mattaf123> i'm trying to group deferreds so that callbacks run in the order that i want (the last "group" or requests called has their callback called last). i've come up with a simple jsfiddle to demonstrate my dilemma: http://jsfiddle.net/SB4yx/1/ suggestions? this may be an overly simplistic example of my current issue, so i may have to alter it. would nested deferreds be a solutions somehow?
[15:33:16] <Caelum> does jquery have a method to get the document object of an iframe? I was using contentDocument but IE8 doesn't seem to have it
[15:34:14] <sacho> Changa, check out $.post's documentation, and if you are not aware of them, consider using chrome developer tools.
[15:34:21] <Caelum> aha, .contents
[15:34:25] <sacho> (or the developer tool variation for your preferred browser)
[15:34:33] <Changa> thanks
[15:34:33] <agu10^> It will run in node.js probably.
[15:34:36] <shoky> agu10^ i've heard good things about: http://slexaxton.github.com/Jed/   haven't used it myself though
[15:34:37] <Changa> I'm reading it now
[15:35:49] <Andrew_R> agu10^: I dont have a suggestion on node.js, but you definitely want to have the text be localized before it gets to the browser
[15:36:38] <b_52globe> hi guys
[15:36:40] <agu10^> If i have a server-side node.js running, yes. Else it can work in the browser.
[15:36:48] <b_52globe> i'm using datatable plugins
[15:37:00] <b_52globe> i code this code http://pastie.org/7130293
[15:37:30] <b_52globe> the datatable is not refreshed instead it gives me eError: aoData[aiDisplayMaster[i]] is undefined
[15:37:30] <b_52globe> [Break On This Error] 	
[15:37:30] <b_52globe> tr = aoData[ aiDisplayMaster[i] ].nTr;
[15:37:42] <b_52globe> anybody have seen this error before ?
[15:38:24] <Andrew_R> https://github.com/coderifous/jquery-localize#readme looks easy to use
[15:40:09] <Caelum> so $('#frame').contents()[0] gets the document object of an iframe
[15:40:49] <agu10^> GetText looks extremely overcomplicated
[15:41:07] <shoky> internationalization is complicated
[15:42:25] <Caelum> argh, this iframeAutoHeight plugin doesn't work with ie10
[15:44:40] <guideX> how do I select a <dt with a <a href in it with a specific link?
[15:45:12] <guideX> I tried $("dt a[href*='/node/add/page']") but it didn't work
[15:45:45] <shoky> did it select the link?
[15:45:52] <guideX> nope
[15:45:58] <shoky> then it's not there
[15:45:59] <air__> jsfiddle?
[15:46:03] <guideX> ah ok
[15:46:07] <Caelum> is that supposed to have quotes in it?
[15:46:35] <shoky> quotes are fine there
[15:46:38] <guideX> hmm I thought it had to
[15:47:24] <guideX> hmm but it looks good eh?
[15:47:34] <guideX> that's correct syntax and all, so must be something else?
[15:47:50] <shoky> guideX: your selector looks good for selecting the link, not the dt
[15:47:56] <guideX> oh..
[15:48:00] <guideX> i'm trying to hide the whole dt
[15:48:05] <guideX> with that link inside
[15:48:43] <shoky> and the html isn't under your control i assume?
[15:48:48] <guideX> well it's a drupal
[15:49:04] <air__> guideX: select the link, then .closest('dt'). but jsfiddle an example and it's a lot easier.
[15:49:04] <guideX> it's in the config pages, I can't edit those
[15:49:21] <guideX> cool thanks air__.. sorry I don't know jfiddle
[15:49:32] <air__> http://jsfiddle.net/
[15:49:41] <guideX> I just don't know how to use it heh
[15:49:45] <guideX> not sure what to expect
[15:49:56] <air__> put your example markup in the uppper left window.
[15:50:12] <guideX> oki
[15:50:21] <air__> choose jquery library in the dropdown on top left, put some js in the lower left.
[15:50:48] <air__> click save, and you'll get a nice link you can paste here.
[15:52:16] <guideX> http://jsfiddle.net/nHMXE/
[15:53:25] <Caelum> god dammit, fuck you IE8
[15:53:47] <shoky> guideX: if you include jquery on the left.. and run it, it does select the link
[15:53:54] <guideX> ah ok
[15:54:06] <guideX> oh no wonder jfiddle never works at all for me lol
[15:54:10] <air__> :)
[15:54:50] <guideX> hmm ok cool
[15:54:52] <air__> guideX: for easier testing. http://jsfiddle.net/nHMXE/4/
[15:54:53] <guideX> well thanks
[15:54:53] <shoky> and to hide the dt do what air__ told you:  $("a[href*='http://www.google.com']").closest('dt').hide();
[15:55:04] <guideX> ok cool
[15:55:20] <guideX> cool thanks, I think that's what I need
[15:55:41] <guideX> thanks agaijn
[15:55:51] <air__> http://jsfiddle.net/nHMXE/5/
[15:55:54] <air__> there's with both versions.
[15:56:39] <air__> er, the first one only hides the <a> of course.
[15:56:48] <guideX> ah I see
[15:57:16] <air__> http://jsfiddle.net/nHMXE/6/
[15:57:21] <air__> some css to show the difference.
[16:14:07] <Foxhoundz> Hello, jQuery
[16:14:17] <coldhead> GUTEN TAG
[16:16:55] <Foxhoundz> Today, I'm going to set out on making my very first jQuery plugin
[16:17:19] <coldhead> best of luck with that, Foxy!
[16:18:52] <rainabba> Foxhoundz: Just so you know, coldhead is just a lovable bot with no intelligence to speak of :)
[16:19:06] <rainabba> In case you weren't aware.
[16:19:12] <coldhead> i hardly see how that's relevant
[16:19:19] <rainabba> My point exactly
[16:19:22] <coldhead> this is just prejudice and racism
[16:19:33] <Foxhoundz> Actually, I couldn't find a plugin that would do this
[16:19:39] <coldhead> i'm not asking for robosexual marriage, i just want to be valued
[16:19:40] <rainabba> More like stereotyping but that has its uses.
[16:19:41] <Foxhoundz> So I'm dead set on making my own
[16:19:59] <Foxhoundz> I just need something like the twitter bootstrap alert but without having to set up static elements in the html before calling the jQuery method
[16:20:15] <rainabba> Foxhoundz: I hear ya. I'm about ready to do the same to deal with web-app time-zone issues :)
[16:22:35] <Caelum> Foxhoundz: heya
[16:22:44] <Foxhoundz> Oh Caelum
[16:22:50] <Foxhoundz> I didn't know you frequented jQuery
[16:22:58] <Caelum> yeah I love this channel
[16:23:38] <Caelum> the only thing that pisses me off the autoindent on jsfiddle
[16:26:03] <Caelum> maybe someday gcc will have a js backend and there'll be a vim port
[16:29:03] <djQuery> Caelum, jsbin
[16:29:15] <coldhead> codepen.io
[16:29:18] <djQuery> believe there is a setting you can chnage the spacing with
[16:29:21] <coldhead> lot of options
[16:31:40] <Caelum> oh neat
[16:38:17] <Changa> Hello: Why does my page go to form action page in Chrome and why does it work in firefox? .post shouldnt allow the page to redirect. -> http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/
[16:38:58] <Changa> 	  event.preventDefault();
[16:39:06] <Changa> this should be preventing it?
[16:39:29] <Changa> ok it just worked -_-
[17:14:53] <barraponto> any recommended form validation plugin?
[17:17:45] <ericelliott> h5Validate, but I'm biassed.
[17:18:44] <barraponto> ericelliott: biased opinions are great, they usually come from people who care.
[17:23:22] <ericelliott> http://ericleads.com/h5validate/
[17:34:30] <Selena> Hello guys, anyone knows how i can properly load with AJAX content from my database on my MODAL WINDOWS?
[17:35:12] <Selena> I managed to do something with AJAX, but problem i have is that it loads same content on all links
[17:35:27] <Selena> and it ignores that the "ids" are different so it should load other data in them
[17:35:57] <Selena> like file.php?id=1 for the first link and file.php?id=2 for the 2nd link on my page
[17:36:10] <Selena> and when i click them to open my modal.. it loads only the id=1 for them
[17:42:39] <hateIE> Internet explorer its a such a animal scurrying along
[17:43:14] <hateIE> cant be beleive how good its working on this foundation temmplate thought :)
[17:44:56] <hateIE> it may redeem itself yet
[17:50:07] <hateIE> 10 pts for layout 10 points for speed 10 points for working translucent bubble effect 10 points for $f30m smoothy text fade .. that is kind of more like it.. now if f12 was better then IE has become allot less hassel over night
[17:53:32] <hateIE> IE10 is smiling now i can just see him
[17:53:38] <hateIE> hes the happiest guy ever
[17:53:58] <Foxhoundz> hateIE: very provocative name, you rebel you
[17:57:40] <dwarder> http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/#examples
[17:57:47] <dwarder> anyone worked with this?
[17:58:00] <dwarder> it doesn't work with the latest stable jquery
[17:58:11] <dwarder> is there a way to make it work?
[17:58:24] <dwarder> or is there an alternative to this?
[17:59:25] <veQue> k this is a question i've asked before,, but here goes
[17:59:45] <veQue> i want to use a text input as an output only
[18:00:00] <veQue> i dont want the user to focus it at all
[18:00:31] <veQue> disabled seemed to work but in ie it showed up in a unstylable way
[18:00:34] <veQue> grey
[18:00:37] <djQuery> <input type="text" disabled />
[18:00:41] <veQue> so disbled is out
[18:01:07] <veQue> djQuery: yeh that way was perferct
[18:01:21] <veQue> if it weren't for that meddling ie
[18:02:13] <veQue> so is my best bet to try and use a div and make it look just like the text input?
[18:02:14] <hateIE> just make a disabled css style for it
[18:02:21] <veQue> hate
[18:02:25] <veQue> hateIE: no
[18:02:30] <veQue> does not work
[18:02:35] <veQue> tried
[18:02:51] <veQue> i can set up on fiddle if you don't believe me
[18:03:48] <hateIE> sure set one up it might help you regardless others might know some techniques to do what you want to
[18:04:05] <darkfrog> how do I reference the <html> tag in jQuery?
[18:04:45] <hateIE> darkfrog isnt that just like saying window. body.
[18:04:49] <darkfrog> it's not an easy thing to Google for. ;)
[18:05:10] <darkfrog> hateIE: I want <html> not <body>
[18:08:10] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/d9Q4a/
[18:08:13] <veQue> ok see
[18:08:34] <veQue> this is super annoying, i talk with the client tomorrow
[18:08:54] <veQue> got like three fixes, this one is the bastard
[18:08:54] <hateIE> darkfrog i think you want document.documentElemnt
[18:09:17] <darkfrog> actually, just figured out $('html') works
[18:09:37] <veQue> darkfrog: cool name
[18:09:57] <darkfrog> veQue: thanks
[18:10:09] <veQue> so any suggestions anyone?
[18:10:37] <veQue> should i somehow display my data in a regular div or something?
[18:11:05] <veQue> but it would have to look like the input looks
[18:11:20] <veQue> bah, i'll give it a try
[18:11:48] <hateIE> hrm
[18:11:56] <hateIE> surely that can be made to work veQue
[18:12:19] <hateIE> by styling INPUT itself and using a class
[18:13:29] <veQue> hateIE: did you open that up in ie, my link?
[18:13:44] <veQue> because i thought i looked over this extensively
[18:13:59] <veQue> but i'll appreciate any help i can get
[18:14:14] * veQue gets nother can of coke
[18:16:51] <veQue> hmm
[18:17:40] <veQue> i cant style the color but i can style the background
[18:18:04] <veQue> "Can the developer make that a little darker and easier to read"
[18:28:21] <Foxhoundz> veQue: it's styling in IE for me
[18:28:34] <veQue> Foxhoundz: link?
[18:28:51] <Foxhoundz> veQue: it's the link YOU posted
[18:28:55] <Foxhoundz> I opened it in ie
[18:28:56] <veQue> oh
[18:28:59] <Foxhoundz> and sure enough the value was red
[18:29:02] <Foxhoundz> so what was the problem?
[18:29:12] <veQue> the color is red, not grey?
[18:29:31] <veQue> it's grey for me
[18:29:49] <veQue> can you tell me your version?
[18:30:00] <veQue> and or screenshot it?
[18:30:07] <veQue> please?
[18:30:59] <Foxhoundz> Interesting
[18:31:06] <Foxhoundz> it won't work on < IE10
[18:31:08] <Foxhoundz> I'm on IE10
[18:31:12] <Foxhoundz> but using IE9 rendering mode
[18:31:19] <veQue> blast!
[18:32:50] <Foxhoundz> veQue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/602070/changing-font-colour-in-textboxes-in-ie-which-are-disabled
[18:33:54] <Foxhoundz> Try his suggestion
[18:33:59] <Foxhoundz> add a readonly attribute
[18:34:01] <Foxhoundz> it seems to work
[18:34:27] <Foxhoundz> If not
[18:34:40] <Foxhoundz> You might have to do some JS hack to style it on IE
[18:34:57] <veQue> readonly can replace disabled="disabled"
[18:35:02] <veQue> ?
[18:35:20] <Foxhoundz> It makes the text box look editable
[18:35:23] <veQue> i think i've tried this
[18:35:30] <Foxhoundz> but typing anything inside is disabled
[18:35:42] <veQue> but is the element unclickable?
[18:35:49] <Foxhoundz> it's clickable
[18:36:14] <Fuzai> Hi could someone familiar with the ajaxForm plugin explain to me how I would move popupDialog(); into the beforeSubmit option? http://pastie.org/7131607 http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/#options-object
[18:36:19] <Foxhoundz> veQue:
[18:36:22] <Foxhoundz> veQue: http://jsfiddle.net/LJ8z7/
[18:37:35] <veQue> Foxhoundz: thanks that's close! now how to prevent the cursor from getting in there?
[18:38:48] <Foxhoundz> Cursor doesn't appear on my browser
[18:38:54] <Foxhoundz> but I'm on chrome
[18:40:08] <Foxhoundz> veQue: would something like this work for you: http://jsfiddle.net/LJ8z7/1/
[18:41:03] <defaultro> does jquery support regex in classname search>
[18:41:29] <Fuzai> Please? :)
[18:41:34] <defaultro> $('[id=.*instance.*]')
[18:42:54] <coldhead> no
[18:43:02] <defaultro> k
[18:43:07] <coldhead> you can add a custom selector method to support it if you need it
[18:43:15] <veQue> Foxhoundz: not quite but gives me an idea
[18:43:17] <defaultro> i'll try that
[18:43:21] <coldhead> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[18:43:40] <defaultro> the button object i am trying to query is from an api
[18:43:55] <defaultro> I don't have control I guess since it's outside domain
[18:44:11] <Foxhoundz> veQue: the way the cursor is displayed is depedent upon the browser, I think, because Chrome doesn't show the cursor when I focus the text box whereas it appears on IE
[18:44:36] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/LJ8z7/2/ this is pretty much the best i can expect
[18:45:03] <Foxhoundz> I was going to suggest blur, but I thought you still wanted to make it selectable
[18:45:06] <veQue> even though i'd rather it not take focus from other inputs, this is good enough
[18:45:15] <veQue> Foxhoundz: nope
[18:45:34] <veQue> i dont want it selectable, just displayable
[18:45:45] <Foxhoundz> Oh
[18:45:51] <Foxhoundz> Why not just a div then?
[18:45:52] <veQue> thanks, you saved the day
[18:46:15] <veQue> well if i use a div it will have to look like the input
[18:46:31] <veQue> i'm doing an instant calculator
[18:46:54] <veQue> eventually i may up date the 'output' to be an input too
[18:47:42] <Foxhoundz> ahh, I see
[18:47:44] <veQue> hmm still grey
[18:48:04] <veQue> ..
[18:48:14] <Foxhoundz> What version of IE?
[18:51:15] <veQue> ok actually not still grey, i forgot to update my actual app, not just the fiddle
[18:51:25] <veQue> but the cursor still gets in there
[18:51:31] <veQue> ie 9
[18:55:51] <ner0x> Using jQuery FileUploader is there a way to clear the current "data" variable so that it contains no files? I've searched the docs for about an hour now with no luck.
[19:02:10] <omani_> I'm unable to pass a string to a function as a parameter
[19:02:20] <omani_> loadCharts('string');
[19:02:39] <omani_> and "function loadCharts(arg) { alert (arg) ; };" says undefined
[19:02:41] <omani_> why?
[19:03:35] <omani_> ok works.
[19:03:37] <omani_> had a typo :/
[19:04:15] <Vooloo> is there a really simple cut and paste javascript widget I could put on my page to switch css styles?
[19:05:04] <Vooloo> one that stays fixed on the left side or something
[19:14:43] <jedimind> question how do you stop an eventlistner within the event itself
[19:14:47] <jedimind> el.addEventListener('ended',function() { . this.removeEventListener('ended'); }
[19:14:55] <jedimind> doesnt seem to make sense
[19:15:16] <defaultro> I fixed it! stopProgration() fixed it! :)
[19:17:25] <tw2113> yay
[19:17:28] <defaultro> :D
[19:17:42] <defaultro> it's been more than 4 hours I've been troubleshooting the issue in IE
[19:17:53] <defaultro> didn't show the problem in Firefox and CHrome
[19:18:26] <tw2113> not surprised
[19:18:35] <defaultro> why is IE so picky?
[19:18:50] <tw2113> because it's IE
[19:18:55] <defaultro> lol :D
[19:19:04] <defaultro> i wish ie can be killed]
[19:20:18] <tw2113> i hope it comes roaring back, as odd as that sounds
[19:20:40] <defaultro> i heard they're realising a new version
[19:20:50] <tw2113> browsers I root for in order 1-3: Firefox, IE/Opera tie, Chrome
[19:21:25] <defaultro> why is Chrome the last?
[19:21:35] <tw2113> because it can take care of itself
[19:21:39] <tw2113> and i'm a mozilla fanboy :P
[19:22:03] <tw2113> IE and Opera are underdogs
[19:22:04] <defaultro> :)
[19:22:18] <shoky> jedimind: why not?
[19:22:18] <defaultro> in my case, we have to make our app work in major browser
[19:22:26] <defaultro> hi shoky :)
[19:22:31] <jedimind> shoky, well for starters it doesn't work
[19:22:34] <shoky> jedimind: and to remove the specific listener you can give a name to the function expression
[19:22:58] <tw2113> sup shoky
[19:23:12] <jedimind> I'm trying to setup a basic test case but its so involved
[19:23:37] <shoky> jedimind: right sorry, so:  el.addEventListener('ended',function myEndedHandler() { …. this.removeEventListener('ended', myEndedHandler); })
[19:23:51] <dcherman> jedimind: you want a non-jquery way of doing it?
[19:24:12] <jedimind> dcherman, whats a non-jquery way of doing it?
[19:24:20] <jedimind> addEventListener is not query to begin with
[19:24:33] <dcherman> jedimind: no i mean you're using addEventListener.  using jQuery you can just use ?one
[19:24:34] <bot-t> jedimind, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[19:24:50] <defaultro> tw2113, i tried opera. I am able to go to the internet. HOwever, it cannot display my localhost webserver
[19:25:00] <defaultro> it works fine in IE, Firefox and Chrome
[19:25:04] <shoky> hi defaultro, tw2113
[19:25:09] <dcherman> that also won't work on oldIE if you need to test there
[19:25:12] <shoky> wusup.
[19:25:22] <defaultro> I looked at the proxy settings and i didn't change anything
[19:25:30] <defaultro> so does opera not accept localhost?
[19:25:34] <jedimind> oh good point dcherman
[19:25:50] <jedimind> oh good point dcherman
[19:25:51] <jedimind> err
[19:25:52] <jedimind> Object #<HTMLVideoElement> has no method 'one'
[19:25:59] <jedimind> sorry, spam, tired, my bad
[19:26:00] <tw2113> works for me defaultro, just tried
[19:26:16] <defaultro> i tricked it by creating a fake www name in hosts file
[19:26:20] <defaultro> that is just weird
[19:30:26] <jedimind> shaky thanks man, i guess because i wasn't naming my function expression it wasn't letting me remove the entire 'ended' eventlistener
[19:30:36] <jedimind> because its a video element
[19:30:45] <shoky> jedimind: np, but i agree with dcherman's suggestion
[19:30:50] <shoky> if you're using jquery, that is
[19:31:04] <shoky> $(el).one('ended', function() { ... })
[19:31:38] <jedimind> it wouldn't let me bind .one
[19:31:44] <jedimind> Object #<HTMLVideoElement> has no method 'one'
[19:31:49] <shoky> that's what the $() is for
[19:31:50] <jedimind> bind with*
[19:32:11] <shoky> you wanna wrap it in a jquery object

[20:11:15] <anew> https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[20:11:28] <anew> how do i get my 'logged_in' session from my db
[20:11:31] <anew> to this cookie ?
[20:29:52] <sphinx_> shoky: any idea for the weird scroll behavior? (http://www.liveshopshare.com/)
[20:30:11] <omani_> does anybody know whether it's possible to have a bootstrap navbar collapsed by default?
[20:47:20] <hip2p> I want to find the closest, previous element with class 'q'. I've tried using closest(), but it isn't working.
[20:49:34] <hip2p> eh I figured it out. Kinda hacky IMO, but it works.
[21:22:03] <echoee> hi guys
[21:22:07] <echoee> can i ask for some help
[21:22:12] <echoee> have this issue whereby
[21:23:10] <echoee> when i click on a checkbox, INSIDE the checkbox, it doesnt update, but whenever I press anywhere else (on a label)
[21:23:13] <echoee> it works
[21:24:26] <initself> echoee: may a jsfiddle?
[21:24:31] <initself> jsfiddle?
[21:24:38] <initself> what's the bot in this channel?
[21:24:40] <echoee> just found that thing, pasting
[21:24:44] <initself> ?jsfiddle
[21:24:45] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[21:24:48] <initself> there we go
[21:25:01] <initself> echoee: a lot of times when i take the time to do a fiddle, I find the bug
[21:25:23] <echoee> question about jsfiddle
[21:25:34] <echoee> do I paste th whole thing with JS, CSS and all?
[21:25:51] <tw2113> i would separate it out by type of content it is
[21:26:00] <tw2113> js goes in the js panel, css goes in css, html goes in html
[21:26:31] <tw2113> though i don't know how much it matters as long as it gets pieced together correctly in the end
[21:26:32] <echoee> got it, give me a minute, really sorry guys, first timer
[21:26:46] <tw2113> you only want 1 minute? usually newcomers get 3
[21:27:06] <tw2113> quick learner
[21:27:46] <agu10^> I can't get jQuery to run on node.js
[21:31:45] <hateIE> oh my goodness some one has made off with my one and only chocolate eclair !!
[21:32:29] <coldhead> that is the second saddest thing i have heard today
[21:32:35] <coldhead> i am sorry for your loss, hateIE
[21:34:20] * tw2113 checks coldhead for chocolate smudges
[21:34:33] <tw2113> he's clean
[21:36:30] <echoee> sorry, cant jsfiddled the thing
[21:36:36] <echoee> too much attachments
[21:38:29] <echoee> hmmm, hopefully this helps
[21:38:32] <echoee> http://jsbin.com/enukuk/1/edit
[21:38:42] <echoee> however I cant regenerate hte bug on this
[21:39:02] <echoee> it only happens when you try to submit using iPhone or iPad
[21:39:14] <echoee> even tho it is checked, it doesnt show on the server
[21:40:51] <echoee> I am not sure if anyone else bumbed into the same situation before
[22:00:24] <echoee> too much works getting it to work on jsfiddle
[22:00:27] <echoee> is a demo site ok?
[22:25:50] <hip2p> I'm using $('#d_body').children().each(function (){ to iterate through all of d_body's child elements. It only iterates through its two immediate children, however. How do I iterate through all descendants?
[22:28:23] <hip2p> looks like .find('*') works
[22:39:13] <ruby_on_tails> hi dhruvasagar
[22:56:35] <coldhead> happy birthday gf3
[22:56:58] <ruby_on_tails> hi coldhead
[22:57:13] <coldhead> well hello there
[22:57:21] <coldhead> how's every little thing
[22:59:13] <ruby_on_tails> they are just little
[23:00:29] <coldhead> to quote rodan: "all the small things change, all the big things change"
[23:04:01] <obert> rodan smith?
[23:05:46] <coldhead> no, rodan the band from kentucky
[23:06:03] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[23:27:36] <innociv_> http://jsbin.com/arihar/1/edit How do I get foo2 index to return "2" instead of "0" because it's the 3rd li in #container rather than its parent?  I tried .index($('#container li'))
[23:30:04] <Cork> innociv_: http://jsbin.com/arihar/3/edit
[23:30:51] <innociv_> Did something mess up? because that's doing nothing
[23:31:46] <Cork> does nothing?
[23:31:58] <Cork> try reloading it then
[23:32:14] <coldhead> u do nothing
[23:32:14] <innociv_> Clicking them does nothing
[23:32:31] <Cork> innociv_: works fine in chrome and firefox here
[23:32:56] <Cork> foo2 index:2 | bar index:1 | foo index:0
[23:33:26] <innociv_> Odd. And I see what you're doing and can't replicate it in production.  Getting 0, unless I'm reading it wrong
[23:33:56] <Cork> innociv_: you want the index from a match set, not the index in the dom
[23:34:07] <Cork> so you need to have the selector and then run index on it
[23:34:14] <innociv_> oh
[23:34:16] <innociv_> I didn't click run with js
[23:35:24] <innociv_> Ty
[23:37:02] <coldhead> great work everyone
[23:39:06] <agu10^> Is there anything i can do to get all TEXT nodes server-side on node.js?
