[00:14:54] <lijzz> what do u mean
[00:24:33] <littulb> when cloning textareas, the text values are not cloned as well. Anyone know how to fix this?
[00:24:39] <mackry> Does anyone know how to pass an object by reference so I can make changes to it in another function?
[00:25:02] <dxgriffiths> Wulf: function Foo() { var keyDown = this.keyDown = function(ev) {}  this.func = function() { $(document).keydown(function(ev){keyDown(ev);}); } }
[00:26:00] <dxgriffiths> mackry: what have you tried already?
[00:27:16] <mackry> var obj = {};   check(obj);   function check(o) { o.pie = 3.14; }   console.log(o.pie);
[00:27:24] <mackry> o.pie does
[00:27:29] <mackry> doesn't exist
[00:28:05] <mackry> sorry, that console.log console.log(obj.pie);
[00:28:47] <dxgriffiths> Did check get run beforehand?
[00:28:59] <coldhead> ?eval var obj = {};   check(obj);   function check(o) { o.pie = 3.14; alert(o.pie); }
[00:29:00] <bot-t> coldhead: 3.14
[00:29:43] <coldhead> ?eval var obj = {};   check(obj);   function check(o) { o.pie = 3.14; } alert(obj.pie);
[00:29:43] <bot-t> coldhead: 3.14
[00:30:16] <mackry> bah! what's the deal in my app... hmmm
[00:36:03] <khurram> can i write jquery $(document).ready(function()  in to  a separate file called jsfunctions and just include that jsfunctions.js file into the html i want all the script to work upon ?
[00:36:54] <coldhead> khurram: you sure can
[00:37:29] <khurram> thanks coldhead but i am not getting my $document.ready function working and showing alert box on my html page ?
[00:37:41] <coldhead> are you including jQuery first?
[00:38:00] <coldhead> <srcipt src="jquery"></script><script src="other.js"></script>
[00:38:28] <abjorn> checked the console for errors?
[00:39:17] <khurram> i used document.write('<script src=;;.....') to include jquery into the jsfunctions.js file and both of the files are loaded correctly i can see them in firebug but my alert box is not popping up
[00:40:22] <coldhead> hmm, document.write can make things unpredictable
[00:42:14] <coldhead> khurram: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/392588/
[00:42:25] <coldhead> that is probably a better way to load another JS file
[00:42:42] <khurram> coldhead: you are right when i removed the document.write it works now but how can i have only one js file and then the rest is in that
[00:43:19] <coldhead> try the paste above
[00:46:45] <coldhead> annnnnnd case closed
[00:47:44] <Tallisman> lol, *looks at a linux terminal build with javascript xd*
[00:48:49] <coldhead> lastdays
[00:49:11] <khurram> coldhead: thanks a lot champ. it works great ...cheers
[00:49:51] <coldhead> a pleasure!
[00:55:23] <khurram> can i listen a form submit action trough my jquery and what i want is when ever a any forms raises a submit event i listen to it and then check the form name of it and if it is my specific form then i perform some thing on it. ?
[00:56:15] <dytrivedi> ?submit @ khurram
[00:56:15] <bot-t> khurram, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[00:56:47] <khurram> second question can i make any form submit button onclick function  to call two separate functions onClick ?
[00:57:14] <khurram> thanks dytrivedi
[00:58:04] <khurram> i.e.   i want to write  <input type =;;;;;  onclick=" a() , b()" />  is it possible?
[00:58:39] <coldhead> don't use onclick
[00:58:48] <coldhead> ?click @ khurram
[00:58:49] <bot-t> khurram, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[00:59:06] <coldhead> $('input').click(function () { a(); b(); });
[01:00:24] <khurram> actually i was given a task to easy the process of putting captcha on the form Our previous captcha we had to add 5 lines in the form and then 20 lines of the javascript and then the complete folder of captcha so what i am doing is i want only
[01:01:29] <khurram> my <img tag> with one text box  to be added to the form and rest i am thinking of automating the steps using jquery to automactiallly check on which form the captcha div is present and then assoricate a onsubmit event handler
[01:01:31] <khurram> to that form
[01:02:32] <khurram> am i on the right track ?
[01:02:38] <khurram> i think it should be fine
[01:04:07] <dytrivedi> I don't think it should be too complex
[01:04:11] <dytrivedi> go ahead man
[01:06:04] <dytrivedi> it doesn't matter, really
[01:06:15] <dytrivedi> with being rapture and stuff
[01:06:30] <coldhead> no that isn't happening
[01:06:33] <coldhead> get back to work
[01:08:16] <dytrivedi> omg
[01:08:20] <dytrivedi> nnooooooo
[01:08:38] <dytrivedi> I bought a BMW giving a post dated cheque
[01:08:42] <dr0id> then why did people waste their time with those banners on streets
[01:08:53] <dr0id> and what about my water bills now
[01:09:12] <dytrivedi> seems like it was a sales conspiracy
[01:09:15] <dytrivedi> marketing stuff
[01:09:21] <dytrivedi> so that people buy stuff
[01:09:26] <dytrivedi> like crazy
[01:09:32] <dr0id> ohh, gotcha
[01:09:38] <dr0id> now they have to pay my water bills
[01:09:59] <dytrivedi> yeah and my BMW
[01:13:48] <m0dmd> dytrivedi you know that's old news right, it's been old for decades.
[01:14:09] <dytrivedi> aww
[01:14:13] <dytrivedi> ima relax
[01:15:42] <coldhead> i think he means he's going to take drugs
[01:22:26] <Whirl3do> What's the nomenclature for z-index in $(something).css("zIndex") or "z-index" or zindex?
[01:26:49] <ravenzz> z-index
[01:26:58] <ravenzz> zIndex is for plain js
[01:27:15] <ravenzz> like elem.style.zIndex
[01:38:54] <skilip> Whirl3do: so for jQuery it's z-index. You need to have the position property set to either 'relative' or 'absolute' as well.
[01:44:02] <Whirl3do> ravenzz, skilip, thx. I thought jQuery substituted camelCase for hyphenated css styles.
[01:44:49] <dxgriffiths> Whirl3do: It does, doesn't it?
[01:45:36] <Whirl3do> dxgriffiths, I guess not. I just looked it up and sure enough you include the hyphen (according the the examples). Wierd, huh?
[01:46:20] <dxgriffiths> Whirl3do: urban legend maybe :)
[01:46:46] <Kambfhase> or maybe its vice versa
[01:47:47] <Whirl3do> perhaps you have to use camelcase if you pass the css method an object:   css('z-index') is fine, but css({z-index:30}).... maybe isn't.
[01:48:25] <Whirl3do> perhaps css('z-index':30} would work. I am so exhausted I can't remember anything.
[01:51:05] <Kambfhase> no, you nee camelCase when you want to access the native style object: style.borderColor
[01:51:33] <Kambfhase> therefor jQ converts your hyphens to camelCase
[01:51:53] <coldhead> anything with - can cause problems unquoted because it looks like a minus sign
[01:51:58] <coldhead> z minus index
[01:52:10] <coldhead> that's why the camel option exists
[01:52:12] <gnarf> ?js {z-index: 30}
[01:52:13] <bot-t> gnarf: SyntaxError: invalid label
[01:52:24] <gnarf> ?js {zIndex: 30}
[01:52:25] <bot-t> gnarf: 30
[01:52:37] <gnarf> ?js ({zIndex: 30})
[01:52:37] <bot-t> gnarf: {"zIndex": 30}
[01:53:14] <gnarf> ?js jQuery.camelCase("coldhead-rules")
[01:53:14] <bot-t> gnarf: TypeError: jQuery.camelCase is not a function
[01:53:29] <gnarf> ?js jQuery.fn.jquery
[01:53:30] <bot-t> gnarf: "1.4.2"
[01:53:36] <gnarf> damn bot-t
[01:53:37] <coldhead> and just like that, my ruling days are over
[01:53:42] <gnarf> you need to upgrade
[01:53:46] <coldhead> bot-t likes it oldschool
[01:54:19] <gnarf> is bot-t gay?
[01:54:27] <gnarf> I'm asking for a friend...
[01:54:34] <gnarf> bot-t: are you gay?
[01:54:34] <bot-t> gnarf, Most likely.
[01:54:58] <Whirl3do> gnarf, coldhead, dxgriffiths, thanks for the clarification.
[02:06:20] <ezl> i want to post all the data in a form via .post() -- most examples i see specify the key value pairs explicitly. is there a way to do is so that i just extract all the values as if it were a regular post (but still suppress the default behavior of reloading the page)?
[02:07:08] <ezl> i have 3 forms on  a page, each has different inputs. i want to be able to submit any of the forms without reloading the page.

[03:22:19] <GreyTrilbyII> Mornin' all
[03:22:55] <GreyTrilbyII> Wee problem with IE9
[03:24:56] <GreyTrilbyII> search script does a show() on a div - results are displayed in it. The each result is in a div with a hover() on it to change the colour. Clicking a result opens the data in an iframe, clears the search box [.val('')] and hides the result div. Works fine in FF, but not IE - IE closes & clears fine, but ignores the a tag. Any thoughts?
[03:27:12] <GreyTrilbyII> in fact, it works fine if I tell it to ignore the close & clear function
[03:30:23] <GreyTrilbyII> ah. Fixed it. Added a short timeout to the close & clear.
[03:30:30] <GreyTrilbyII> thanks for all your help
[03:30:31] <GreyTrilbyII> ahem
[03:38:19] <timing> GreyTrilByII forgot it's weekend
[03:39:09] <coldhead> bot-t: tell GreyTrilbyII thanks for the most boring bug report about IE9 and iframes of all time
[03:39:10] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[03:49:53] <mavv> hi! i have big problem with loading flash elements via ajax. of course it's happens only in IE8 and older. anyone? i tried swfobject but ie8 throws error. also tried adding to url unique timestamps. other ideas?
[04:27:19] <khurram> hi all
[04:28:02] <khurram> can i store a value into some variable before sending the data to the client and when the POST come back i check the original value i sent to the client is this possible ?
[04:28:38] <dr0id> wow, awesome
[04:28:42] <dr0id> plain simple awesome
[04:34:21] <nail_> khurram: just store that in the user session
[04:34:47] <ravenzz> khmer why not?
[04:35:11] <toot> hey folks - not sure if this is jquery or css issue (and i'm rather stuck so advice welcome) :) - works spot on in FF4, but Safari/Chrome don't clip based on the border-radius properly :S http://dev.dotlabel.co.uk/botb/c/
[04:37:24] <iszak> toot, clearly a CSS issue.
[04:37:35] <ProLoser|Mobile> anyone here use markitup?
[04:39:37] <toot> iszak - i tend to agree. boo :) i fear it's maybe more of a browser issue at that - which is even worse
[04:40:32] <iszak> toot, does this look like the bug http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=62363 ?
[04:43:07] <toot> eek - thanks iszak. oh dear :D
[04:43:19] <toot> square lens it is me thinks :D
[04:45:11] <iszak> toot, could you not use margins to a similar effect?
[04:45:40] <glupek> Hello. Can I select only classes of an element that match some regular expression?
[04:46:28] <iszak> use filter
[04:46:33] <iszak> filter @ glupek
[04:46:39] <iszak> ?filter @ glupek
[04:46:39] <bot-t> glupek, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[04:47:05] <glupek> Thanks.
[04:47:50] <toot> iszak - what you thinking on margins? (i welcome any suggestions at this stage)
[04:48:34] <iszak> toot, could you not set margins on botbSpotZoomWrapper instead of top/left?
[04:49:28] <toot> ahhhhhh
[04:49:39] <toot> hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[04:50:02] <toot> will go and play - thanks for the suggestion!!
[05:05:28] <shaggy__> Is there a way to run a php method/function thing on a button click, using jquery ?
[05:06:17] <glupek> I still don't know how to do it. I have an element, which class="field selected link05" and I want to select only name of the class which contains "link" in the begging (in fact I want to extract that number "05"). How do I do it?
[05:14:15] <dxgriffiths> glupek: .filter(function(index) { return this.attributes.class.match(/link\d{2}/) !== null })
[05:14:19] <dxgriffiths> Something like that anyway.
[05:15:13] <dxgriffiths> shaggy__: You can use .get() to trigger a PHP call and optionally receive a result string.
[05:15:59] <dxgriffiths> shaggy__: $("#buttonID").click(function() { $.get(
[05:17:48] <shaggy__> dxgriffiths: can you store information in the button? Because I'll have many of the same button just with tiny changes in data
[05:18:39] <dxgriffiths> shaggy__: Sure... you can use .data() to set it at run-time, or use data-blah="" attributes in the HTML.
[05:18:58] <dxgriffiths> shaggy__: Depends on what you need.
[05:19:25] <shaggy__> I'm thinking the attributes in the HTML would be most effective for me in this situation
[05:19:54] <dxgriffiths> shaggy__: Where blah is whatever you want the data to be retrievable as later. data-x="10" becomes readable via jQuery as .data("x"), iirc.
[05:20:49] <shaggy__> Is there any documentation on the jquery site about it?
[05:21:10] <dxgriffiths> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[05:22:33] <dxgriffiths> shaggy__: Look under HTML 5 data attributes. It's not just for HTML 5 though, it's just called that.
[05:23:56] <shaggy__> Thanks mate. This looks promising
[05:24:08] <dxgriffiths> np
[05:30:52] <shaggy__> but dxgriffiths, if I have it setup like: class foo { function bar() { // MySQL drop x } }. How to I use .get to tell the file that the function bar() is the function I want to run
[05:32:18] <dxgriffiths> shaggy__: At the PHP end you'd have to set up a file that reads the query string for clues, or is at a particular address like /drop.php
[05:32:40] <dxgriffiths> Or dostuff.php?action=drop&item=blah
[05:33:03] <shaggy__> alright. I've got a handler.php file, so I'll set that up to look for it. Thanks. Was hoping just to do directly too the file oh well :)
[05:33:05] <shaggy__> thanks again
[05:35:16] <dxgriffiths> shaggy__: no worries, hope you nail it.
[05:47:05] <toot> arghghghg i hate browser bugs!!!! :D
[05:49:34] <Anitox> yesterday, i had a client complaining that their site didnt look right in IE6
[05:54:33] <Wiz_KeeD> has anyone here used ui datepicker?
[05:54:43] <Anitox> yes
[05:55:00] <Wiz_KeeD> Anitox, can you please tell me if there is a way to set the minimum starting date?
[05:55:20] <Wiz_KeeD> i have searched pretty much all pages and i found some properties to set there
[05:55:27] <Wiz_KeeD> but still i have the full catalog open
[05:56:12] <Anitox> yeah, there's a thing for disabling dates
[05:57:18] <Anitox> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#event-beforeShowDay
[05:58:15] <Anitox> just set beforeShowDay to a function which takes a Date object as an arg
[06:01:09] <Wiz_KeeD> Set as beforeShowDay function to prevent selection of weekends.
[06:01:46] <Wiz_KeeD> not exactly what i needed
[06:02:01] <Anitox> var my_date = new Date();
[06:02:27] <Anitox> beforeShowDate: function(date) { if (date < my_date) { return Array('false'); } });
[06:02:39] <Anitox> err beforeShowDay*
[06:03:07] <Anitox> when it goes to show a day on the calendar, it calls this function, and if the function returns false in teh array, it wont be selectable
[06:03:34] <Anitox> the code i just provided is the default behavior, so you will need to set the my_date to a different date to see it in action
[06:07:31] <dtach> how can i make the following work, if( $('.posterOverlay').hasClass('selected') ){ $(this).click(); } i'm trying to click the .posterOverlay that has the class selected added to it
[06:07:57] <glupek> dxgriffiths, I didn't get ".filter()" to work, but I found there isn't need to use filter: $(this).attr("class").match(/link\d{2}/);. Thanks for help though.
[06:08:05] <Anitox> dtach, are you wanting to simulate the click?
[06:08:11] <Anitox> or are you wanting to make a click event?
[06:08:35] <dtach> Anitox: the click of the .posterOverlay (which i have) toggles it's appearance and i just want to click the one that is selected
[06:08:36] <dxgriffiths> glupek: Oh cool, thanks for letting me know.
[06:09:12] <Anitox> dtach, $('.postOverlay').hasClass('selected').click(function() { alert("it was clicked."); });
[06:09:36] <Anitox> ?
[06:10:38] <dtach> Anitox: what if .postOverlay already has a click function and i want to use that, but only on the one that has the class added to it?
[06:10:59] <dtach> Anitox: $('.postOverlay').hasClass('selected').click();  doesnt work though thats pretty much what im hoping to do
[06:11:18] <Anitox> hmm, k
[06:11:23] <dtach> oh wait the name is wrong
[06:11:38] <BinaryKitten> dtach .hasClass returns a boolean
[06:11:56] <dtach> ah
[06:11:57] <Anitox> oh yea
[06:12:19] <Anitox> $('.postOverlay *:selected').click();
[06:12:20] <Anitox> ?
[06:12:25] <BinaryKitten> $('.postOverlay').filter('.selected').click()
[06:12:29] <Anitox> there thats better
[06:13:04] <IceCas> Hello, does Jquery have an equivalent do nothing/pass for-loop keyword?
[06:13:33] <BinaryKitten> Anitox  $('.postOverlay *:selected').click(); will return selected within .postOverlay not the .postOverlay that is selected
[06:13:55] <Anitox> $('.postOverlay:selected').click();
[06:14:05] <Anitox> im still workin on my coffee ;)
[06:14:39] <Anitox> oh yeah, just ignore my stuff
[06:14:50] <Anitox> cause :selected is not gonna work for this
[06:15:09] <Anitox> since you're looking for a class, not an actually selected option
[06:15:19] <BinaryKitten> $('.postOverlay').filter('.selected').click() :)
[06:15:28] <Anitox> think we got a winner
[06:15:30] * BinaryKitten is not just an ugly mug
[06:15:47] * BinaryKitten is also an ugly cup and an ugly plater
[06:16:28] <IceCas> Hello, does Jquery have an equivalent do nothing/pass for-loop keyword?
[06:16:46] <Anitox> break;
[06:17:06] <Anitox> or continue;
[06:17:07] <IceCas> is that the safest method?
[06:17:15] <IceCas> continue sounds safer. Thanks
[06:17:17] <Anitox> you're wanting to stop a loop?
[06:17:25] <Anitox> continue just skips the current iteration and goes to the next
[06:17:27] <Anitox> break stops teh whole loop
[06:17:48] <IceCas> well im using Jquery do detect IE6 on a webpage and if it is i want them to scold the user if its not i want it to do nothing
[06:17:54] <BinaryKitten> IceCas depends on what you are doing
[06:18:02] <Anitox> scold those users!
[06:18:10] <IceCas> hell yea!
[06:18:18] <Anitox> you shouldnt need a loop for that though
[06:18:39] <IceCas> well im noobish at programming in jquery (and in general sorta)
[06:18:45] <dtach> BinaryKitten: i just get <error> in my log
[06:19:03] <BinaryKitten> IceCas  http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/browser-warning
[06:19:16] <Anitox> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[06:19:29] <BinaryKitten> no point doing what has already been done before
[06:19:42] <BinaryKitten> there are LOADS of plugins for different types of IE warnings
[06:19:58] <IceCas> Wow. This is awesome. Thanks
[06:20:01] <IceCas> Ill check it out
[06:20:23] <BinaryKitten> also there is native browser checks IF IE lte 6
[06:20:38] <IceCas> native in the code?
[06:20:44] <BinaryKitten> native in the html
[06:21:12] <IceCas> im not sure what that would be..
[06:21:16] <BinaryKitten> ala http://www.thefutureoftheweb.com/blog/detect-ie6-in-javascript
[06:22:05] <BinaryKitten> dtach ok you do..
[06:22:20] <BinaryKitten> it's a bit complicated to help
[06:22:21] <iszak> Hai BinaryKitten
[06:22:28] <BinaryKitten> hey iszak
[06:22:52] <dtach> BinaryKitten: i know its kinda hard to make an example
[06:22:52] <BinaryKitten> dtach  need more code, more information etc..
[06:23:08] <IceCas> Thanks BinaryKitten I will review this now.
[06:23:20] <BinaryKitten> i'll be right back..
[06:23:30] <BinaryKitten> trackpad drivers are fritzing
[06:25:09] <Renegade001> This might seem like a silly question but is "Vanilla Javascript" or "Vanilla JS" a term to refer to basic Javascript i.e no libraries?
[06:26:25] <dxgriffiths> Renegade001: Can be. It might also mean JS that hasn't been run through a compiler like http://altjs.org/
[06:26:56] <Renegade001> Ah, I see
[06:27:02] <Renegade001> Thanks dxgriffiths :)
[06:27:18] <dxgriffiths> Renegade001: np :)
[06:34:02] <dtach> the filter is targeting the right element but it keeps looping (im using it inside another click function
[06:35:42] <dtach> nvm dont think its the filter :p
[06:37:49] <dtach> got it to work thanks Anitox and BinaryKitten
[06:46:13] <khurram> is there a problem doinf ajax call inside form.submit ?
[06:47:30] <khurram> $('form').submit  only works if i write  return false in it and if i have a flag which i set upon success of ajax inside the submit function then it is always fasle and doesn't even print the alert.
[06:48:00] <khurram> i think the submit form finishes before the ajax call returns how to stop this behaviour ?
[06:48:50] <dtach> how can i fix my problem with adding a click to a main div, with elements inside, i only want the click to launch when the background is clicked, now it launches even when clicking on any of the elements inside
[06:48:58] <erichynds> khurram, you need to call event.preventDefault() so the form won't submit naturally.
[06:50:14] <khurram> i call it but preventDefault and return false both behave the same way i want the form to submit if the  flag is true. and if it is true i return true and it is false then i do return false or preventDefault but nothing working as it sholujd
[06:50:34] <erichynds> ?p @ khurram
[06:50:34] <bot-t> khurram, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[06:52:28] <khurram> erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/WhwZD/
[06:52:56] <erichynds> ajax doesn't work like that
[06:53:07] <erichynds> the flag is returned before the ajax even completes
[06:53:23] <erichynds> anything you want to happen that is dependent on the success of the ajax call, you must put inside the success handler
[06:54:12] <erichynds> call preventDefault() no matter what, and in the success handler, manually submit the form via form.submit()
[06:55:01] <khurram> ok i try
[06:56:37] <levu> if element a is currently animated, how do i wait until the animation finished? like this: a.waitAnimFinished().fadeIn();
[06:59:27] <erichynds> levu, in 1.6 you can do $.when( $('#elem').animate().promise() ).then(fn)
[06:59:44] <erichynds> or just pass animate a complete callback
[07:00:10] <levu> erichynds: is there a solution for 1.4?
[07:00:23] <erichynds> yes, pass animate a complete callback
[07:00:45] <khurram> erichynds: it still submits the form on the wrong answer with the preventDefault(); and return true.
[07:01:25] <erichynds> khurram the way you have it setup, that function will always return false
[07:01:30] <levu> erichynds: oh, tha'ts not possible because the animation is started from an event and the other animation from an other event...
[07:01:40] <khurram> then what should i do ?
[07:02:09] <erichynds> i told you
[07:02:15] <erichynds> on form submit, always prevent default
[07:02:19] <erichynds> don't worry about returning anything
[07:02:22] <erichynds> do your ajax
[07:02:43] <erichynds> at the point where you want the form to actually submit, call submit() on the form element
[07:02:50] <chuck24> does anyone know of a way/or resource to a way that I can re-fire jquery-tabs after an ajax call? I am actually replacing the whole div containing tabs, not just the content of the a single tab
[07:02:51] <erichynds> the element itself - not the jquery object
[07:02:52] <khurram> i am doing exactly per you have a look at updated one http://jsfiddle.net/WhwZD/1/
[07:03:00] <erichynds> so $('form')[0],submit()
[07:03:40] <erichynds> khurram http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/WhwZD/2/
[07:06:55] <khurram> erichynds: it is still not working it always go to alert('wrong answer')  and even i added the lines preventDefault() and return false; it still submits the form.
[07:07:29] <erichynds> if it's always going to the alert then data is never equaling true
[07:07:44] <erichynds> console.log(data) and see what it says
[07:10:59] <khurram> erichnyds: it is saying preventDefault() is not a function ?
[07:11:34] <erichynds> it's event.preventDefault()
[07:11:36] <erichynds> look @ my fiddle
[07:11:42] <khurram> and the log gets clear so fast i can't read the data ? what to do now ?
[07:11:47] <erichynds> you will also need to pass the event object into the handler
[07:11:57] <erichynds> press the persist button in firebuyg
[07:11:59] <erichynds> firebug*
[07:12:10] <dtach> how can i fix my problem with adding a click to a main div, with elements inside, i only want the click to launch when the background is clicked, now it launches even when clicking on any of the elements inside
[07:12:51] <levu> dtach: if (event.target == this) ...
[07:13:49] <dtach> what i mean is i have $('#grid').click(function() {} and inside the grid are blocks (divs) and clicking a div seems to run the grid click even though they also have a higher z-index
[07:15:01] <Nveid> Ok.. having somewhat of an issue.. I thought my code was good.. But it is not so
[07:15:39] <Nveid> Basically I need to nest a variable inside image_files.. data : $('#product_form').serialize(true)+"&image_files="+files	
[07:15:53] <Nveid> where as files is $.params(some_array)
[07:16:27] <khurram> erichynds: the data return from the server is "true" but the the  in the sucess function   if ( data == "true" ) is not ok it
[07:16:35] <sunscreen> hey any one had experience with nativeradio flash player?
[07:16:50] <erichynds> khurram try if( $.trim(data) == "true" )
[07:18:28] <khurram> Object { readyState=4, responseText="true", more...} i tried with $.trim(data) still not working
[07:19:11] <erichynds> data doesn't == true then
[07:19:16] <erichynds> otherwise it would be true
[07:19:50] <pingec> $('#photo').animate({opacity: 0}, 1000).animate({opacity: 1}, 1000) why does this animate even div's that are outside the #photo div?
[07:20:46] <khurram> if it is true then why it is always going to the else and showing alert(wrong data);
[07:21:12] <erichynds> because it isn't true
[07:22:00] <khurram> i have changed the true to "a" now but still do not know why the if condition  is not working
[07:22:28] <pingec> IE8 actually does animate only the #photo div
[07:22:33] <pingec> other browsers not :/
[07:24:34] <khurram> erichynds: should i return json instead of just echo 'a'; may be encoding problem or any thing else is stopping my if to compare the data with the 'a' ... in the console i have response  returned as 'a'
[07:24:54] <khurram> why the if ( data == "a") is not true ??????????
[07:25:37] <Nveid> the world just needs to collectively kill IE
[07:31:07] <Nveid> anywho know how to combine .serialize(this) and nest a $.param() in nested serialization?
[07:39:03] <pingec> http://pingec.si/sample/ Does anyone know why it is animating also divs that are not inside #photo div ?
[07:46:44] <khurram> can any expert here help me please
[07:47:16] <pingec> it's Saturday people are doing other things
[07:47:40] <khurram> my brain has become dull, boaring, and i am gonna get patient of depression with jquery  form.submit
[07:48:02] <khurram> day off on jquery
[07:48:12] <BinaryKitten> people have all been raptured
[07:48:29] <BinaryKitten> anywhoo
[07:48:55] <BinaryKitten> pingec do you think it could be due to the possibility that div's can't self close?
[07:49:05] <khurram> lolz
[07:49:12] <BinaryKitten> and as such the browser is rendering the divs below as part of it?
[07:50:08] <pingec> BinaryKitten I have no idea why but I'd like it not to do that
[07:50:23] <khurram> any one like to see why my if condition is not working on data == "true"  even the console.log is showing the response as "true" http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/WhwZD/2/
[07:50:48] <BinaryKitten> pingec  try <div id="photo"></div> instead of <div id="photo" />
[07:53:11] <pingec> BinaryKitten the whole page rendered differently now so i guess it's bad html on my part
[07:53:20] <pingec> good catch :D
[07:53:34] <BinaryKitten> no worries. sometimes it takes a 2nd pair of eyes
[07:53:48] <pingec> yeah, definitely.
[07:53:55] <BinaryKitten> khurram how are you returning the data>
[07:54:03] <pingec> Thanks for taking a look :)
[07:54:09] <khurram> just single line echo "true";
[07:54:18] <khurram> Thanks a lot maaan
[07:54:23] <khurram> you are the man here
[07:54:35] <BinaryKitten> no i'm not
[07:54:37] <khurram> rest are kittens
[07:54:44] * BinaryKitten = Girl
[07:55:10] <khurram> whoooooooo Girls can also do Jquery they just can't find socks in the cupboard
[07:55:10] <geekbuntu> the name 'binarykitten' is cool tho... would be a good software brand name
[07:55:11] <BinaryKitten> While i'm sure being "the man" is cool.. none of my stuff would look right
[07:55:16] <khurram> how far is quering
[07:55:19] <khurram> just joking
[07:55:56] <BinaryKitten> anyway..
[07:56:10] <khurram> yea
[07:56:38] <BinaryKitten> khurram check your processing script
[07:56:50] <BinaryKitten> there could be a problem with extra data being returned
[07:57:21] <khurram> i have tried using $.trim on it as well
[07:57:35] <BinaryKitten> yes.. but i'm not talking about spaces
[07:57:45] <BinaryKitten> there could be any number of other things coming through
[07:57:59] <BinaryKitten> but that's my guess
[07:58:10] <BinaryKitten> try outputting data.length
[07:58:17] <BinaryKitten> on console
[07:58:34] <BinaryKitten> see if you get more than expected
[07:59:05] <khurram> http://jsfiddle.net/WhwZD/4/ this is the latest what i have now
[07:59:28] <khurram> i try length Thanks BT
[07:59:36] <khurram> i try length Thanks BinaryKitten *
[08:00:53] <khurram> BinaryKitten: length is undefined ? but why
[08:01:09] <BinaryKitten> data.length is undefined?
[08:01:26] <khurram> it does show response = "true"  strange
[08:01:31] <BinaryKitten> interesting
[08:01:39] <BinaryKitten> it's not a string
[08:02:00] <khurram> how to do var_dump on it in javascript to check what it is then
[08:02:12] <BinaryKitten> console.log(typeof(data));
[08:02:26] <khurram> ah i c
[08:02:52] <BinaryKitten> jquery is seeing the true as bool (i guess)
[08:02:59] <BinaryKitten> try setting the dataType
[08:03:23] <khurram> dataType = object
[08:03:44] <BinaryKitten> heh
[08:04:10] <khurram> in the latest http://jsfiddle.net/WhwZD/4/ i have
[08:04:37] <BinaryKitten> khurram in your ajax.. use dataType
[08:04:44] <BinaryKitten> dataType: 'html'
[08:04:50] <BinaryKitten> then you can string check it
[08:05:05] <BinaryKitten> without dataType it will try to autodetect the type
[08:05:08] <khurram> oh you mean to use html instead of text lemme try that
[08:05:18] <BinaryKitten> html/text no difference
[08:05:47] <khurram> the ..... is still not working
[08:05:57] <khurram> even i changed the type to html
[08:05:58] <dtach>  i have $('#grid').click(function() {} and inside the grid are blocks (divs) and clicking a div seems to run the grid click even though they also have a higher z-index
[08:06:01] <BinaryKitten> ok well there is little more i can do to help you..
[08:06:10] <khurram> before was dataType: 'text'
[08:06:20] <BinaryKitten> the issue here is not jquery but the return response
[08:07:11] <BinaryKitten> dtach inside children doesn't matter about z-index
[08:07:15] <neerq> Hi, i've got a problem which only occurs in Internet explorer. I am using a dropdown list to fetch data from my server. This is my script: http://pastebin.com/cQ0D2pJK
[08:07:29] <neerq> When the dropdown menu is changed, i check to see if there is some data already, and if so... I remove that data... on line 30..
[08:07:56] <neerq> In all browsers, these fadeout and empty method are called BEFORE i request the new data...
[08:08:14] <BinaryKitten> neerq ok .. let me look
[08:08:19] <neerq> but in IE, the fadeout and empty methods are called after the new data is fetched.. and it removes the new data...
[08:08:34] <khurram> BinaryKitten: should i encode data in json and then try it may be
[08:08:55] <dtach> BinaryKitten: okay, but i just dont get why what i add to the grid runs when i click a different div thats inside of it, is there something i can do about that?
[08:09:02] <guy> hm
[08:09:22] <guy> how to filter out element by class? $('li[class!="no-tab"]')
[08:09:23] <BinaryKitten> dtach you need to prevent bubbling
[08:09:24] <guy> like this?
[08:09:43] <BinaryKitten> guy .not('.no-tab')
[08:09:44] <guy> no .. wait, that won't work
[08:09:47] <guy> ah, ok
[08:10:03] <BinaryKitten> or ... li:not(.no-tab)
[08:10:24] <guy> I think .not('.no-tab') is better since it is jQuery rather than CSS dependant?
[08:10:30] <neerq> BinaryKitten, I know the empty method is called after the ajax request, because of the console.log's.. They pop up after 'fetching product data'...
[08:11:37] <TC_> $("#messages").attr({ scrollTop: $("#messages").attr("scrollHeight") });
[08:11:39] <TC_> This won't work.
[08:11:40] <TC_> :(
[08:12:06] <BinaryKitten> does it have an attribute with that?
[08:12:14] <astropirate> huuuu TC_ what are you trying to do?
[08:12:15] <BinaryKitten> are you using 1.6?
[08:12:22] <khurram> is there any function in javascript like php print_r or var_dump ?
[08:12:31] <TC_> Latest jQuery. I have a div with with a scrollbar.
[08:12:34] <TC_> I want to scroll to bottom
[08:12:36] <TC_> auto.
[08:12:41] <TC_> like when you send a message on a chat :P
[08:13:40] <BinaryKitten> TC_ .scrollTop
[08:13:47] <BinaryKitten> also don't double search the dom
[08:14:28] <TC_> what would the value be.
[08:15:09] <BinaryKitten> var elem = $(selector); elem.scrollTop(elem.prop('scrollHeight')) ?
[08:15:25] <TC_> $("#messages").scrollTop($("#messages").attr("scrollHeight"));
[08:15:27] <TC_> is what I have
[08:15:28] <TC_> but that won't wokr
[08:15:33] <TC_> :(
[08:15:36] <BinaryKitten> var elem = $(selector); elem.scrollTop(elem.prop('scrollHeight')) ?
[08:15:39] <dtach> BinaryKitten: got it thanks
[08:15:47] <BinaryKitten> dtach got what
[08:16:45] <dtach> to work :)
[08:16:55] <BinaryKitten> neerq ok you're next
[08:17:37] <neerq> BinaryKitten: great :)
[08:17:46] <TC_> got it working
[08:17:47] <TC_> ^_^
[08:17:57] <BinaryKitten> TC_ using that code?
[08:18:03] <TC_> ya
[08:18:22] <BinaryKitten> in 1.6 there was a split between .attr and .prop
[08:18:28] <TC_> ah.
[08:18:39] <BinaryKitten> if it's not on the elem in the html... .attr won't work
[08:18:40] <TC_> well my next issue, which is an annoying thing with me...
[08:19:01] <TC_> I have a setInterval so it repeats a piece block every second.
[08:19:04] <TC_> but it crashes on me.
[08:19:09] <TC_> I mean it doesnt' kill the browser
[08:19:14] <BinaryKitten> eg <item text="aaa"> .attr('text') would work.
[08:19:14] <TC_> it just stops working?
[08:19:33] <khurram> is there any function in javascript like php print_r or var_dump ?
[08:19:52] <BinaryKitten> khurram console.debug
[08:20:06] <khurram> thanks love
[08:20:17] <BinaryKitten> TC_ i'll be back to you soon..
[08:20:25] <TC_> alright.
[08:20:31] <incorrect> sorry for the newbie question, but i can't see what is wrong with my syntax: .jstree("create", null, "last", { "attr" : { "rel" : type } });  type is only a string as far as i can tell
[08:20:32] <BinaryKitten> neerq lets see if we can't clean up that code 1st
[08:20:50] <BinaryKitten> neerq you have lots and lots of dom searching you don't need
[08:20:58] <incorrect> if i replace type with a "type" then the function call happens, but the console leaves me no clues to what has broken
[08:21:21] <neerq> BinaryKitten, this isn't even half of it.. this is only the relevant part of my code... :(
[08:21:30] <BinaryKitten> bugger
[08:21:51] <BinaryKitten> ok lets skip over the clean up..
[08:21:57] <neerq> Could you show me a dom search i don't need?
[08:21:58] <neerq> I mean..
[08:22:14] <neerq> how else would i do something to an element?
[08:22:16] <BinaryKitten> neerq every call to $(selector) is a dom search
[08:22:35] <BinaryKitten> var item = $(selector);  item.xxxx; item.yyyy etc etc
[08:22:43] <BinaryKitten> 1 dom search many uses
[08:22:54] <khurram> BinaryKitten: it was all because the complete function does not return XHR object in the first arg so that is why i changed the complete function to success function and now atleeast i am getting correct length
[08:23:22] <BinaryKitten> khurram cool.. this is why i prefer to use the helper functions if i can
[08:23:26] <BinaryKitten> eg $.post
[08:24:22] <khurram> sweet dreams BT
[08:24:28] <neerq> BinaryKitten, okay.. thanks for the tip, i will clean up the rest of my code like you said. But I'm still not sure why internet explorer is executing it in different order..
[08:24:29] <BinaryKitten> neerq  eg instead of 4 or 5 $('#infoContainer') calls....   var infoContainer = $('#infoContainer');  infoContainer.hide().
[08:24:43] <BinaryKitten> that's the issue we need to process now
[08:25:01] <neerq> Okay.. and that would speed up my code a little, right?
[08:25:04] <BinaryKitten> neerq in which order is it doing it?
[08:25:20] <BinaryKitten> neerq with the amount in that snippet alone, it will speed it up a huge amounts!
[08:25:31] <neerq> I'll show you the output of the console.log's..
[08:26:26] <eldar> hi. is there any documentation on Menu from jquery ui 1.9 preview?
[08:26:31] <neerq> BinaryKitten: here you can see the order of execution: http://pastebin.com/f2j5Y6Vs
[08:26:51] <neerq> as you can see, the last two records are fadeout and empty
[08:27:14] <neerq> but firefox (for example), shows fadeout and empty after 'infocontainer not empty'...
[08:27:47] <BinaryKitten> neerq i can see why
[08:28:01] <BinaryKitten> asynch behaviour
[08:28:32] <BinaryKitten> the call back for the clear is called when the animation (fadeOut) is complete
[08:28:42] <BinaryKitten> it doesn't wait for that to complete before doing the ajax call
[08:28:55] <BinaryKitten> both are triggered 1 after the other
[08:29:05] <BinaryKitten> both run side by side with different outcomes
[08:30:23] <neerq> hmm.. so the fadeout and ajax call are running simultaneously
[08:30:33] <BinaryKitten> yes..
[08:30:41] <neerq> how could i fix this? by qeueing i guess..
[08:30:43] <BinaryKitten> i'm reworking the sample you gave
[08:30:55] <neerq> ah.. that's great :)
[08:31:17] <TC_> BinaryKitten, did you have a fix for me yet?
[08:31:38] <BinaryKitten> TC_ no, not working on your problem TC_ you're next in queue
[08:31:47] <TC_> Ah. ;P
[08:32:02] <BinaryKitten> $.queue('binaryKitten', TC_.issue);
[08:32:09] <BinaryKitten> it does return a promise though
[08:32:14] <neerq> lol
[08:32:19] <BinaryKitten> :)
[08:32:33] <TC_> How far back in the waiting list am I?
[08:32:41] <TC_> I have lives to save.
[08:32:56] * TC_ 's spidersense is tingling
[08:33:12] <beasty> lol
[08:33:21] <beasty> TC_: the end is near!
[08:33:27] <beasty> ah!
[08:33:30] <beasty> waah!
[08:33:48] <TC_> the end already started for new zealand
[08:34:20] <beasty> lol ?
[08:34:42] <eml> should've started here too afaik
[08:34:50] <eml> not Finland is sunny & nice :>
[08:34:52] <TC_> it starts here in 2.5 hours
[08:36:41] <BinaryKitten> TC_ you're queue position is 1
[08:36:51] <TC_> WoopWoop
[08:36:55] <BinaryKitten> your queue position even
[08:37:13] <BinaryKitten> neerq the .has('h2') in your code, what do you think that is doing?
[08:39:13] <BinaryKitten> neerq?
[08:39:21] <neerq> BinaryKitten, sorry, i was getting something to drink
[08:39:25] <neerq> ehm
[08:39:26] <neerq> well
[08:39:27] <BinaryKitten> no worries :)
[08:39:43] <neerq> the data i'm getting from the server is HTML... and always contains an <h2> element
[08:39:50] <BinaryKitten> ah right..
[08:39:57] <neerq> so if there is a <h2>, it's not empty
[08:40:31] <BinaryKitten> i'll switch that out then to a .html().length != 0
[08:40:32] <khurram> can change the <img src=''>  using jquery ajax function where a php image.php file makes a new png image and returns the source how can i update the image using ajax ?
[08:40:54] <BinaryKitten> khurram data uri
[08:40:58] <neerq> BinaryKitten, okay.. that's probably better..
[08:41:10] <BinaryKitten> ?g data: uri
[08:41:11] <bot-t> BinaryKitten, Data URI scheme - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme
[08:41:11] <khurram> thanks love
[08:41:17] <TC_> bad service BinaryKitten, he should be behind me in line!
[08:41:36] <BinaryKitten> TC_ not really the same level of issue..
[08:44:16] <khurram> ahem ahem BinaryKitten would u mind writing a sample line which will just update the src attribute of the <img id='img' sr..... /> using jquery ?
[08:44:29] <pifantastic> TC_: I can help you
[08:44:38] <BinaryKitten> yes i would mind khurram
[08:44:44] <khurram> aaah
[08:44:57] <pifantastic> khurram: $('img').attr('src', 'whatever');
[08:45:02] <BinaryKitten> since it's really simple to use attr to put data into the src
[08:45:09] <BinaryKitten> and prefix it with data:
[08:45:32] <TC_> pifantastic, I have a setInterval piece of code, which.. executes a block of JS every second. Sometimes it stops happeinng so I had to reopen the page to get it working again.
[08:46:14] <pifantastic> TC_: can you paste your code?
[08:46:16] <pifantastic> and read this
[08:46:24] <pifantastic> ?g setInterval considered harmful
[08:46:26] <bot-t> pifantastic, Why I consider setInterval to be harmful | Blog | Zetafleet | Web ... - http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[08:46:37] <khurram> pifantastic: i am using $("#captcha_image").attr("src",data);  in side the success: function of ajax but it doesn't update my image where data is comming from a image.php file which generates a image using imagepng function
[08:46:57] <TC_> can't find the link, pifantastic
[08:47:01] <TC_> sever not found :P
[08:47:08] <BinaryKitten> khurram issue with data types
[08:47:17] <pifantastic> TC_: works for me
[08:47:19] <TC_> oh, i refreshed.
[08:47:21] <pifantastic> ?down zetafleet.com
[08:47:23] <TC_> http://pastebin.com/MqvpZzuS here is my code.
[08:47:25] <TC_> well, a small snippet
[08:47:31] <khurram> now what should be the data type of an image ?
[08:47:44] <pifantastic> khurram: is it a base64 encoded image?
[08:47:44] <bot-t> pifantastic, No results found for 'zetafleet.com'.
[08:48:23] <khurram> i dont know i just copied pasted the script from phpweb site help imagepng function how to know if it is base64 image ?
[08:48:40] <pifantastic> khurram: can you link me to that script?
[08:48:50] <khurram> yes sure
[08:48:52] <pifantastic> TC_: this is why you dont use setInterval, it hides errors :(
[08:49:04] <TC_> it shouldn't error, it just stops working.
[08:49:10] <TC_> i've used the same code on other peoples sites and it works for them
[08:49:29] <TC_> can you write the same code in a better format, pifantastic?
[08:49:37] <TC_> I thougth setTimeout is only a single execution.
[08:49:40] <khurram> pifantastic: http://jsfiddle.net/WhwZD/6/
[08:49:44] <pifantastic> TC_: are you using Insector/Firebug to look at the ajax requests and responses?
[08:49:57] <khurram> this is the file which generates the image
[08:50:22] <TC_> it's random, pifantastic. I've been waiting for like... an hour for it to duplicate.
[08:50:25] <TC_> -.-
[08:51:00] <BinaryKitten> neerq http://jsfiddle.net/pCvFj/
[08:51:39] <neerq> BinaryKitten.. wow.. that looks a lot cleaner!
[08:52:03] <pifantastic> khurram: do you have this running on a server somewhere?  Also, that's not the complete PHP script
[08:52:30] <BinaryKitten> let me know if you need any of the changes explaining
[08:52:37] <darkis> Hello
[08:52:46] <BinaryKitten> oh hai darkis
[08:53:22] <darkis> i have two fields 1: input and 1:select
[08:53:27] <neerq> BinaryKitten, why did you rename the variables to $infoContainer
[08:53:32] <neerq> Why the $?
[08:53:34] <darkis> and i would like to do a condition on them
[08:53:38] <khurram> pifantastic: yes i am using local host and if you want the jquery code then its here http://jsfiddle.net/WhwZD/7/
[08:53:43] <BinaryKitten> i use $ to denote that they are jQuery objects
[08:54:01] <darkis> if(input.change || select.change) { do somthing }
[08:54:02] <neerq> Ah... right.. that's clever :)
[08:54:15] <darkis> what's the right syntax ??
[08:54:23] <BinaryKitten> it's nothing other than part of the name.. does nothing special neerq
[08:54:37] <BinaryKitten> just made sense when you are passing the actual ID through to the event
[08:54:46] <neerq> i know.. but i didn't think of it
[08:54:49] <pifantastic> khurram: what does checkAnswer.php return/
[08:54:50] <pifantastic> ?
[08:55:23] <BinaryKitten> neerq the bonus of this methodology (bind/trigger) is that you can call on that from other things
[08:55:25] <khurram> it return echo "true" if answer match and echo "false" on else part;
[08:55:49] <BinaryKitten> eg $(selector).trigger('updateInfo', [1,'en']) etc
[08:55:58] <BinaryKitten> from anywhere as long as it's bound
[08:55:59] <khurram> the problem is in the else part where the answer doesn't match  and i want to reload the new image using jqury
[08:56:20] <khurram> pifantastic: the problem is in the else part where the answer doesn't match  and i want to reload the new image using jqury
[08:56:27] <t432> everytime the submit button is clicked the "jq()" function is called which stores the value of the form and should pop up and alert box containg the values, the alert box is not seem to be poping up.. http://pastebin.com/ig42Z8tt
[08:56:27] <pifantastic> khurram: it looks like you are setting the src of the image equal to the string "true"
[08:56:42] <neerq> BinaryKitten, I see :) thanks man. I am going to test it out now.. I hope it works
[08:56:51] <BinaryKitten> fingers crossed
[08:56:56] <bingomanatee> Does anyone have a favorite for skinner that they have found effective? Esp. one that ties in to UI.
[08:57:10] <pifantastic> khurram: if your image has src="image.php" and you want to reload it, just reload it with a cachebusting GET param, src="image.php?451123123363"
[08:57:14] <TC_> setTimeout only runs once, pifantastic..
[08:57:14] <BinaryKitten> bingomanatee define "skinner" please?
[08:57:28] <pifantastic> TC_: read that entire article plz
[08:57:39] <bingomanatee> something that takes form elements and makes them pretty
[08:57:43] <khurram> yes you are right thanks i have fixed it but still doesn't show the image
[08:57:55] <BinaryKitten> pifantastic is that the one that calls setTimeout again unless a flag has been set?
[08:58:04] * BinaryKitten missed the link before
[08:58:18] <pifantastic> khurram: are you using Firebug/Inspector to look at the HTTP request/response for the image?
[08:58:18] <bingomanatee> I prefer setEndOfTime
[08:58:33] <bingomanatee> much of my work will only kick in during the Rapture
[08:58:35] <BinaryKitten> bingomanatee that's a fixed value in some versions
[08:58:46] <pifantastic> BinaryKitten: You just call setTimeout again at the end of your callback
[08:59:09] <khurram> pifantastic: in the response i have PNG image in binary format
[08:59:09] <BinaryKitten> pifantastic yep, that's what i thought.. i usually have a flag in there though
[08:59:20] <Eugeny> http://mapping.ax3.net/
[09:00:01] <iamjarvo> i have a 3 elements on a page with the same class. i want to fade them in one after the other would the best way to do this is to use delay? how do i make sure the second always go before the first? what if the first takes forever and goes beyond the specified delayed time
[09:00:09] <pifantastic> khurram: you dont want to set the src of the image equal to binary data, you want to set the src of the image to a URL that returns binary data
[09:00:11] <TC_> I did, but it mentions the use of setTimeout but that only runs once...
[09:00:21] <pifantastic> D:
[09:00:52] <pifantastic> you did not read the entire article
[09:01:11] <t432> When the submit button is clicked the "jq()" function is called which holds the value of the form into an array (sucessive submits), an alert box displaying the values should appear, as it stand this alert box is not appearing.. http://pastebin.com/ig42Z8tt
[09:01:12] <pifantastic> TC_: From that article: http://jsfiddle.net/2uEZ5/
[09:01:14] <BinaryKitten> iamjarvo i'm jsfiddling for you
[09:01:16] <pifantastic> look at b
[09:01:39] <iamjarvo> BinaryKitten:  thank you
[09:02:03] <iamjarvo> i could do it in recursive way
[09:02:22] <khurram> pifantastic: you are champ
[09:03:28] <toot> i have a moveable div (#bob) - when i click inside it - i can lock it/stop it moving further, i then want to see what the mouse position relative to the top left of the div is - any tips please (bad head day) :)? http://dev.dotlabel.co.uk/botb/b/new.html
[09:03:37] <khurram> pifantastic: it doesn't load the source into the <img ../> it says no image ?
[09:04:23] <pifantastic> can you rephrase that?
[09:06:12] <TC_> Ah, setTimeout in the function too.
[09:06:15] <khurram> in the html  when the broswer renders the <img tag it loads the image.php file /> but in my case by simply changing the src attribute to image.php file again doesn't load it
[09:06:44] <khurram> i have request browser to render the <img src..../> again ?
[09:07:57] <toot> khurram try ? image.php?random-number
[09:08:01] <toot> so that your changing it
[09:08:30] <khurram> how do you generate a random number using javascript?
[09:08:58] <pifantastic> ?eval +(new Date)
[09:09:00] <bot-t> pifantastic: 1305994131403
[09:09:08] <toot> http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=javascript+random+number :)
[09:09:13] <khurram> Wow it works
[09:09:21] <khurram> Love you all
[09:09:36] <khurram> thanks to all of you live long happy life cheers
[09:09:44] <toot> heheh
[09:10:23] <BinaryKitten> iamjarvo  still here
[09:10:28] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/VrYdS/
[09:11:41] <khurram> ahem there is some new issue now when the user answers wrong i display the message " wrong answer , try again" and i successfully load a new image but the submit is not functional now
[09:13:50] <BinaryKitten> iamjarvo???
[09:14:42] <iamjarvo> BinaryKitten:  let me check it out
[09:16:06] <BinaryKitten> iamjarvo  sorry made a small error http://jsfiddle.net/VrYdS/1/
[09:16:10] <iamjarvo> BinaryKitten:  thanks! . i came up with something similar where i recursively call the function on the next element
[09:16:15] <BinaryKitten> forgot to pass speed through
[09:16:22] <neerq> BinaryKitten, the script you made works perfectly.. It looks like it's a lot faster too :) Now I am going to modify my entire script the way you did.. (removing the dom searches etc..) thanks!!
[09:16:48] <BinaryKitten> neerq if you have learnt something today then I am happy to oblige
[09:17:05] <BinaryKitten> now i need to really learn more about promises and deffereds heh..
[09:17:16] <iamjarvo> thank you BinaryKitten
[09:17:31] <BinaryKitten> i can't really speak on the topic unless I know about it
[09:17:44] <neerq> BinaryKitten, i sure did :) thanks again.. now i'm going to eat.. bye
[09:17:56] <BinaryKitten> hhmm
[09:18:02] <BinaryKitten> I wonder whay bye tastes like
[09:18:13] <BinaryKitten> *what bye tastes like
[09:18:39] <neerq> hehe
[09:18:41] <dtach> how can i find out why IE8 fails to use my array when ANY other browser works fine 100% no error ?
[09:19:07] <BinaryKitten> dtach do you have an comma after the last item in the array?
[09:19:28] <dtach> not according to console.log
[09:19:48] <BinaryKitten> do you have console.log in the file? and the console not enabled
[09:19:57] <dtach> heres my array creator http://jsfiddle.net/2Kunp/
[09:20:25] <dtach> IE8 dev tool doesnt help out, same error "null or not an object"
[09:20:35] <dtach> no error in any other browser
[09:20:58] <dtach> problem seems to be .url
[09:21:15] <tbranyen> dtach: it'd help if you actually made items in the markup too
[09:21:18] <tbranyen> so we could test this..
[09:21:45] <BinaryKitten> dtach
[09:21:56] <BinaryKitten> didn't i do this before?
[09:22:03] <dtach> yes
[09:22:17] <BinaryKitten> ok and what did i suggest that time?
[09:22:19] <dtach> its a bit different now which was an attempt to fix the IE error
[09:22:23] <Bartzy> Hi
[09:22:29] <dtach> but no difference
[09:22:52] <dtach> BinaryKitten: i dont know what you suggested? remind me
[09:23:13] <Bartzy> I know it's not exactly related to jquery.. but I have a simple GIF (arrow going left and right, about 15-20 frames overall... and on slow computers it really kills the browser.... Any idea why ? GIFs shouldn't do that...
[09:23:17] <BinaryKitten> well 1st off i got you to put in proper html for it..
[09:23:38] <BinaryKitten> Bartzy have no clue..
[09:23:43] <dtach> huh?
[09:23:50] <dtach> you mean the fiddle now?
[09:23:53] <BinaryKitten> yes
[09:23:57] <t432> When the submit button is clicked the "jq()" function is called which holds the value of the form into an array (sucessive submits), an alert box displaying the values should appear, as it stand this alert box is not appearing.. http://pastebin.com/ig42Z8tt
[09:24:06] <tbranyen> Bartzy: why do you need an animated gif for that?
[09:24:07] <dtach> i made one yesterday just cant find the url
[09:24:08] <t432> sorry for the repeat!
[09:24:35] <Bartzy> tbranyen: Because when I use jquery animate it kills performance entirely... it's a never-ending animation that just kills low-end computers.
[09:24:40] <dtach> and it doesnt matter because i got a TON of code, and im just hopelessly trying to fix the stupid IE error
[09:24:48] <Bartzy> tbranyen: especially on IE
[09:24:48] <dtach> i got nothing to work with because ANY other browser works 100% fine
[09:25:05] <tbranyen> Bartzy: you're doing something wrong then, since IE handles animation fine... people have been doing it for YEARS
[09:25:18] <tbranyen> its not like animation is this brand new thing
[09:25:20] <BinaryKitten> dtach you're tacking this from a symptomatic pov..
[09:25:30] <BinaryKitten> which doesn't help fix the cause of the problem
[09:25:45] <tbranyen> t432: you really need to catch up with modern frontend best practices
[09:25:48] <dtach> BinaryKitten: if youre willing i could give you the url to my project but do keep in mind its a horrible big file right now, since im trying to code it all together then polish it and im not a real programmer
[09:25:53] <tbranyen> t432: you'll find shit doesn't break so often
[09:26:00] <na3r__> what is the diffrence bettwen bind('click') and $('something').click();
[09:26:21] <BinaryKitten> na3r__ the latter is a helper function
[09:26:23] <tbranyen> na3r__: .click uses .bind('click'
[09:26:28] <Bartzy> tbranyen: It's a recursive animation. I don't think I did it wrong. I got the code from this channel back then... And was told that jquery animation is not really intended for loop usage, and can be slow, and if I want speed I should use GIF
[09:26:28] <BinaryKitten> with a value it trigger's bind
[09:26:37] <BinaryKitten> without it, it calls trigger
[09:26:45] <t432> tbranyen: I am complete newb when it comes to client side
[09:26:52] <BinaryKitten> eg .click(fn)   = .bind('click', fn);
[09:26:52] <tbranyen> t432: i noticed :-p
[09:27:02] <amid_hasan> hi
[09:27:02] <BinaryKitten> .click() = .trigger('click');
[09:27:27] <tbranyen> t432: wtf do you want to reset the form after its been submitted
[09:27:32] <tbranyen> what happens if there is a validation error
[09:27:35] <tbranyen> you want to clear the whole thing???
[09:28:00] <tbranyen> also don't call your function jq, thats far too close to jquery and doesn't describe what it actually is/does
[09:29:17] <tbranyen> also don't use new Array >_>
[09:29:48] <tbranyen> and if you have an if statement immediately after creating the array checking its length.. its obviously going to be 0
[09:29:57] <BinaryKitten> dtach  http://jsfiddle.net/2Kunp/1/
[09:30:09] <tbranyen> t432: you reading this or am i talking to myself
[09:30:25] <t432> form is not submitted
[09:30:32] <t432> it is cancelt read line 1
[09:30:39] <tbranyen> seriously.. you didn't read anything i just wrote
[09:30:39] <t432> line 11
[09:31:13] <tbranyen> t432: if you never submit it, why do you have a submit button? why not just a normal button?
[09:31:18] <t432> question wasnt about validation
[09:31:38] <t432> hang let me read the whole thing
[09:31:41] <tbranyen> okay the answer probably has to do with your document$('#name')
[09:31:44] <tbranyen> syntax
[09:31:48] <tbranyen> which doesn't make any sense and isn't valid
[09:31:52] <tbranyen> dunno why you thought that'd work
[09:32:09] <tbranyen> just get rid of the document part
[09:32:21] <t432> ok
[09:32:23] <tbranyen> and t432 i brought up validation as a reason why you wouldn't want to reset the form
[09:32:24] <abjorn> why are we worrying about the jqweries? it's party time!
[09:32:42] <tbranyen> i don't care if you brought it up, since you obviously didn't think about it and i hope you don't create forms in the future that automatically reset after submitting
[09:32:45] <BinaryKitten> dtach sorry ... made a mistake there http://jsfiddle.net/2Kunp/2/
[09:33:00] <tbranyen> abjorn: not for another 5.5 hours here
[09:33:13] <abjorn> not for 6.5 hours here
[09:33:18] <abjorn> that's 6.5 hours I have
[09:33:18] <tbranyen> that doesn't make sense :-/
[09:33:19] <abjorn> TO PARTY
[09:33:22] <tbranyen> it happens at 6pm est
[09:33:38] <abjorn> lol coldhead told me it's suppsoed to be 6 pm local time wherever you are
[09:33:44] <abjorn> cause, you know, the rapture follows time zones
[09:33:45] <tbranyen> ...
[09:33:55] <tbranyen> you listened to coldhead, thats your first problem
[09:33:58] <abjorn> roflmao
[09:34:07] <abjorn> he said it came from the "official rapture website"
[09:34:11] <BinaryKitten> coldhead is the fountain of all knowledge
[09:34:26] <BinaryKitten> how dare you question him, infidel!
[09:34:37] <abjorn> well, I have an undetermined amount of time to party...all the more reason to party hard!
[09:35:33] <dtach> BinaryKitten: this works when i alter it to my needs but my code as a whole still gives it the error, so i guess its not that bit but that is 1 out of 2 things above where it breaks
[09:35:53] <BinaryKitten> dtach probably
[09:36:34] <BinaryKitten> also , how do you mean alter to your needs?
[09:36:45] <dtach> im updating it, 1sec please
[09:37:44] <dtach> must look really weird like this but http://jsfiddle.net/2Kunp/4/
[09:37:49] <amid_hasan> http://jsfiddle.net/6cA5X/2/  I'm trying to show/hide divs by clicking on a button. Now: stuck on creating variable which will select current div id
[09:38:13] <amid_hasan> basically all divs positioned on top of each other. not sure what to do next...
[09:38:22] <dtach> BinaryKitten: this does work in IE8 :s
[09:38:27] <dtach> so im dumbfound
[09:38:32] <BinaryKitten> :D

[09:39:36] <c0decub1> hey
[09:39:42] <t432> tbranyen: revised code dosnt work either... http://pastebin.com/P0eGxb0E
[09:40:00] <c0decub1> in Jquery how would i make this: http://pastebin.com/eExKguSE hide automatically on page load
[09:40:29] <dtach> but if i insert into my code i still get the error
[09:41:22] <tbranyen> t432: this is why inline event handlers suck
[09:41:27] <dtach> BinaryKitten: i know it looks horrible and i havent polished it but this is my actual code http://jsfiddle.net/aXVBz/
[09:42:05] <BinaryKitten> gah
[09:42:07] <abjorn> It's okay guys. Macho Man Randy Savage is gonna elbow drop Jesus and prevent the Rapture.
[09:42:11] <BinaryKitten> i can see why dtach
[09:42:14] <bittyx-laptop> hi all! i'm making an admin panel with ajax functionality. when i use the .post() function, does all the cookie data get sent automatically as well? i need to know this, so i could use sessions regularly
[09:42:27] <t432> tbranyen: inline event handlers suck as opposed to?
[09:42:58] <BinaryKitten> dtach there is no point looping and creating that array
[09:43:06] <tbranyen> t432: http://jsfiddle.net/lark/G6Hhk/
[09:43:07] <tbranyen> look at that
[09:43:09] <BinaryKitten> when you're just going to each over the aray later
[09:43:16] <c0decub1> nvm i did it
[09:43:39] <dtach> BinaryKitten: the $.each?
[09:43:48] <BinaryKitten> yep
[09:43:59] <BinaryKitten> you might as well .each over the original collection
[09:44:15] <dtach> im confused, but how can i use the array and fill a list?
[09:44:19] <t432> hmm. object #name has no method called val
[09:44:28] <dtach> if its not with each which i thought because it does work (in anything but IE8)
[09:44:29] <BinaryKitten> i'll show  you ..
[09:44:35] <dtach> thank you
[09:46:10] <dtach> BinaryKitten: oh and movieID might as well by the playIndex, not sure why i did that
[09:46:17] <dtach> oddity :x
[09:46:21] <BinaryKitten> :) np
[09:47:02] <tbranyen> t432: i don't know what to tell you, it works great for me
[09:47:46] <Ratty> Hi, I have an issue with my jquery... I have content that is tabbed and I use a pagination plugin for long content. Whenever I click on things continuously the pagination plugin breaks whenever you click on page 2 or page 3 of about. Here is a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qkRjG/2/embedded/result/
[09:47:48] <bingomanatee> is anyone using a form decoration module they like?
[09:47:54] <Ratty> Do any of you have any ideas what is causing this?
[09:50:45] <t432> tbranyen: that code dosnt show the alert box either
[09:51:21] <t432> oh hang on
[09:51:31] <t432> think i left out a line
[09:52:41] <tbranyen> t432: uh why are you touching the code, i pasted the url directly in my browser
[09:52:41] <dtach> bingomanatee: there are a bunch, http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/ http://network.experasolution.com/2011/05/jquery-form-plugins/
[09:52:44] <tbranyen> typed a word and hit submit
[09:52:45] <tbranyen> and it worked
[09:52:53] <BinaryKitten> dtach i would like to know where #GoWatch
[09:53:01] <BinaryKitten> is and what it refers to
[09:53:37] <t432> well dsont work for me
[09:53:57] <BinaryKitten> dtach eg .. if i click the item #GoWatch.. what am i clicking on
[09:54:01] <dtach> BinaryKitten: a button on the page which takes the user to a different part of the page
[09:54:08] <BinaryKitten> ok..
[09:54:09] <dtach> then shows the videos
[09:54:41] <BinaryKitten> and where does playIndex come from
[09:56:29] <TC_> setTimeout is also buggy.
[09:56:35] <TC_> my friends browser, it doesn't execute more than once.
[09:56:36] <TC_> but mine does..
[09:57:08] <dtach> BinaryKitten: begins at 0 then each new movie it plays it gets ++ so that it plays the next one in the list
[09:57:14] <dtach> *list i mean array
[09:57:20] <t432> tbranyen: dont see anything wrong with this code right? http://pastebin.com/7QhB0BiX
[09:57:23] <t432> your code
[09:57:41] <BinaryKitten> ok..
[10:07:07] <clorith> Does anyone know of a jquery function/addon that'll let me draw on top of an image (so the image is already loaded, I'd just liek to add a line or two to it)
[10:07:47] <Kambfhase> clorith: position a div right above the image.
[10:08:03] <pifantastic> ?g fabric.js @ clorith
[10:08:04] <bot-t> clorith, Demo of a Fabric.js  HTML5/Javascript canvas library and an SVG ... - http://kangax.github.com/fabric.js/test/demo/
[10:08:34] <clorith> That looks brilliant
[10:08:35] <clorith> thank you!
[10:10:15] <BinaryKitten> dtach still around?
[10:12:15] <dtach> yes BinaryKitten
[10:12:24] <BinaryKitten> cool
[10:12:29] <BinaryKitten> i'm still reworking it
[10:12:58] <BinaryKitten> but it's looking a lot better already
[10:13:21] <BinaryKitten> somethings i can't think on improving as i don't have the native source
[10:15:08] <foxhoundz> Hello jQuery
[10:15:36] <BinaryKitten> say hello @ foxhoundz
[10:15:40] <BinaryKitten> ?say hello @ foxhoundz
[10:15:46] <BinaryKitten> bah stupid bot
[10:17:45] <cool123> hello if anyone can fix the pagination problem please pm me ....so i can pay him
[10:17:54] <cool123> http://www.clickstudio.info/edilalwebsite/search-result/
[10:18:31] <BinaryKitten> dtach how do you know when a movie ends?
[10:23:28] <clorith> Kambfhase, do you know how using this to draw might react with other things also interacting with the map?
[10:23:55] <clorith> I have this zoom jQuery plugin running to zoom in on an image wherei t's hovered, I wanted to drawo n the image to indicate where a user should zoom to view what they wanted out of the iamge
[10:28:09] <dtach> BinaryKitten: apple has a script that supplies a listener option
[10:28:20] <BinaryKitten> ok
[10:28:21] <dtach> BinaryKitten: im already using it to call a function which like this one doesnt work in IE8 yet
[10:35:36] <dtach> i'll be here thank you again for your hard work BinaryKitten means a lot
[10:36:32] <BinaryKitten> can you pastebin for me that call function?
[10:39:53] <ner0x> What would be the best way to switch between item lists in a select. IE: User chooses USA, states populate the list, user chooses Canada, Provinces are now in the list.
[10:41:40] <dtach> BinaryKitten: you mean when its done playing?
[10:42:29] <SoulRaven> hi
[10:42:40] <SoulRaven> what is data.indexOf
[10:42:42] <SoulRaven> ?
[10:43:28] <BinaryKitten> dtach yes
[10:43:44] <BinaryKitten> ?.indexOf
[10:43:55] <SoulRaven> yes
[10:44:05] <BinaryKitten> need a bit more information SoulRaven
[10:44:15] <BinaryKitten> it can/could be a lot of things
[10:44:17] <SoulRaven> i have found:)
[10:44:21] <SoulRaven> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexOf.asp
[10:44:24] <dtach> BinaryKitten: it calls nextTrailer which is pretty much the same code as the button but it takes the next item (and doesnt animate anything, it does recreate the object because there was no other way of making it continue playing)
[10:44:34] <ner0x> Say, how a postal service changes states/provinces on a country change.
[10:45:03] <dtach> BinaryKitten: would you want the url to my main js file or something? though its very unpolished but might help?
[10:45:26] <BinaryKitten> dtach that would be good
[10:45:35] <BinaryKitten> i'll add you to the pm-firewall
[10:45:40] <dtach> ok
[10:45:56] <BinaryKitten> if you want to pm me the url rather than the whole channel that is fine this time :)
[10:46:04] <dtach> ok thank you
[10:46:33] <dtach> did that work? im on the webchat thing
[10:47:25] <BinaryKitten> yep it did
[10:47:25] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to make something like data.lenght or data.size?
[10:47:43] <SoulRaven> i want to check i succes from ajax query is more that 0
[10:47:45] <dtach> BinaryKitten: great i will be here to assist if you need me
[10:51:03] <sokie_de> SoulRaven is data always a string?
[10:51:08] <dtach> BinaryKitten: i have to add that it uses 1 script it wont need in the future, like i said my goal was/is to make it work then polish it and make it as good as i possibly can
[10:51:22] <BinaryKitten> ok
[10:52:38] <sokie_de> indexOf will not work if data is of type object
[10:52:43] <ner0x> Document fragment?
[10:53:00] <ner0x> Something I can do in jquery?
[11:02:12] <pifantastic> ner0x: there are a lot of ways to accomplish that
[11:02:42] <pifantastic> ner0x: depending on how/where your city/country data is stored
[11:10:28] <glupek> How do I convert String object (new String ()) to primitive string?
[11:11:58] <m0dmd> Recommendation anyone.
[11:12:04] <gnarf> glupek: ??? it is a string?
[11:12:23] <gnarf> ?js jQuery.type(new String("test"))
[11:12:26] <m0dmd> what would result in a quicker autocomplete search.
[11:12:33] <m0dmd> 1. Database retrieval ajax
[11:12:51] <m0dmd> Or, 2. autocomplete searching through a file with records line by line
[11:13:14] <m0dmd> I need the autocomplete to be extremely fast like that of Google, but no cloud support :p
[11:13:50] <pifantastic> m0dmd: what are you searching against?
[11:14:02] <m0dmd> Or let me rephrase the question, what would be faster, autocomplete accessing a file with records per line, or a database
[11:14:10] <pifantastic> database
[11:14:12] <wafflesburger> use a database
[11:14:15] <wafflesburger> it would be faster + easier
[11:14:31] <m0dmd> The ease isn't the issue but the speed :) you got it.
[11:14:51] <m0dmd> Guess autocomplete ajax DB->request it is.
[11:14:55] <m0dmd> thanx fellas.
[11:14:57] <wafflesburger> kk
[11:14:58] <m0dmd> and ladies
[11:15:06] <wafflesburger> ease should always be a priority imo :P
[11:15:20] <m0dmd> getting things to work perfectly, isn't always easy :)
[11:15:42] <glupek> gnarf, jQuery.type(new String("")) gives "string", but typeof(new String("")) gives "object"
[11:15:53] <wafflesburger> the only reason things would be really slow would be if your'e doing something terrible
[11:16:15] <wafflesburger> (usually)
[11:16:29] <glupek> gnarf, but I found that it's new String("").valueOf() that gives primitive string
[11:16:40] <m0dmd> wish I can cancel going to this graduation !
[11:16:50] <m0dmd> I'd rather work.
[11:22:07] <TC_> Is it possible to do: $("input[name=message]").attr("disabled", "disabled").val("").removeAttr("disabled");
[11:22:13] <TC_> instead of .. having multiple lines?
[11:22:36] <stan_man_can> try it and see
[11:23:48] <wafflesburger> not sure why you would do that
[11:24:31] <RobW> it would happen so fast..
[11:25:07] <TC_> hence the idea.
[11:25:21] <TC_>  ineed to disable it, because if I hit enter twice.
[11:25:26] <TC_> it'll double submit the message.
[11:25:29] <TC_> or tripple, for htat matter
[11:25:31] <TC_> so i had to do it
[11:26:16] <m0dmd> wafflesburger, pi
[11:26:26] <wafflesburger> ?
[11:26:48] <m0dmd> wafflesburger, pifantastic should I incorporate the autocomplete caching to make things quicker
[11:26:54] <m0dmd> Or is it even necessary
[11:26:55] <wafflesburger> for sure
[11:27:11] <wafflesburger> there are some autocopmlete plugins i'm sure
[11:27:18] <wafflesburger> unless you really want to write your own for some reason
[11:27:18] <m0dmd> yea the jquery plugin
[11:27:19] <m0dmd> :)
[11:27:45] <m0dmd> I think the novices need to live on jquery :)
[11:27:50] <m0dmd> It saves lives!
[11:28:04] <wafflesburger> hehe
[11:29:39] <m0dmd> gotta run, lata wafflesburger thanx for the help man
[11:29:48] <m0dmd> will you be around later this evening?
[11:29:49] <wafflesburger> peaceie
[11:29:51] <wafflesburger> maybes
[11:30:03] <m0dmd> alright no diggity
[11:30:08] <m0dmd> You have a good day now
[11:30:26] <wafflesburger> you too
[11:33:05] <TC_> http://pastebin.com/WSZLhXmD I'm gettin an unexpected ) on the final line...
[11:33:09] <TC_> oh fack.
[11:33:10] <TC_> line 19
[11:35:49] <TC_> Damn. Look I have this: $.addMessage = function(message) {
[11:35:51] <TC_> and I do
[11:35:52] <TC_> $.addMessage($("input[name=message]").val());
[11:35:55] <TC_> thats not possible, is it?
[11:37:26] <pifantastic> why not?
[11:38:13] <TC_> well it's just...
[11:38:19] <TC_> it's inserting blank message into the db llol
[11:38:53] <pifantastic> Have you checked the value of $("input[name=message]").val() ?
[11:39:22] <TC_> fack.
[11:39:31] <TC_> I clear it before submitting to the db
[11:39:33] <ravenzz> check the values by server-side
[11:39:42] <ravenzz> before to insert them on the db
[11:50:35] <albacker> hi, i'm loading jquery and jquery ui using google.load (google js api), and i've copy pasted the code from jqueryui's slider page. (the code is simple : <div id='slider'></div> and the js code $('#slider').slide()), and when i'm loading the page everything displayes (two youtube videos using swfobject) except the slider. How can i go for debuggning/fixing this? Thanks in advance.
[11:51:27] <ravenzz> are you loading the css too?
[11:52:33] <albacker> ravenzz, i guess not, unless you're talking about the 2lines of css included in the sliders page (source code)..
[11:53:45] <ravenzz> you should include the jQuery UI's css
[11:55:02] <albacker> ravenzz, where can i find it?
[11:56:08] <ravenzz> wait.. why you loading jquery and jquery ui with google api?
[11:56:49] <albacker> i don't have to go and download the .js files.
[11:57:05] <albacker> this is all i do google.load("jqueryui", "1.8.13");
[11:57:12] <albacker> and google.load("jquery", "1.6.1");
[11:57:13] <ravenzz> you shouldn't
[11:57:28] <albacker> why?
[11:57:59] <ravenzz> you can use CDN hosted version
[11:58:13] <ravenzz> http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#CDN_Hosted_jQuery
[11:58:14] <brdma_> when I use .keypress() to capture input on a text box, it seems to be called before the value of the textbox actually changes... what should I be using instead of keypress if I want to get the value of the input as it changes?
[11:58:25] <ravenzz> http://code.google.com/intl/it/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery
[11:59:13] <ravenzz> then you can do <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[11:59:22] <ravenzz> the same for jQuery ui
[11:59:25] <ravenzz> and his css
[12:00:26] <albacker> ravenzz, well what's the url/path for the css file in this case?
[12:00:42] <ravenzz> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.13/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[12:00:55] <albacker> great
[12:00:57] <albacker> thank you
[12:01:12] <ravenzz> np
[12:01:28] <brdma_> ah, for those wondering, .keyup seems to do what I want.
[12:02:29] <ravenzz> ./dinner
[12:09:51] <solsTiCe> what is the best ? if($('#myid').attr('id')) ... or if($('#myid').attr('id') != undefined) ... i.e. it's better to test against undefined ?or is there something else ? more  la jquery
[12:10:47] <ajpiano> solsTiCe: what are you trying to do
[12:10:57] <ajpiano> test if $("#foo") actually found any elements?
[12:11:20] <solsTiCe> no
[12:11:36] <solsTiCe> I add an id attr to a list of element
[12:11:47] <ajpiano> you're adding the same ID to multiple elements?
[12:11:49] <Corren> anyone know any jquery & ui experts that might be interested in an adventure?
[12:11:54] <solsTiCe> and the last list has not an id attr
[12:12:19] <tbranyen> Corren: allow me to express such doubts on this promise of said adventure
[12:12:21] <solsTiCe> ajpiano: I was asking just about best practice
[12:12:24] <ajpiano> solsTiCe: long story short, just doing the first if will work, an empty string evals to falsy
[12:12:45] <Corren> eh? :)
[12:14:07] <Corren> tbranyen: we're actually looking to hire someone full time, sorry if saying an "adventure" makes it sound sketchy
[12:14:17] <tbranyen> Corren: oh neato
[12:14:32] <Corren> i just want to convey we're having a ton of fun in the process :P
[12:15:09] <tbranyen> Fun is good
[12:15:51] <ajpiano> Corren: tbranyen and i work together, and we had a crazy adventure the other night chasing down a cat
[12:15:58] <ajpiano> so i think we're both adventured out :p
[12:16:04] <Corren> ha
[12:16:20] <Corren> do you know anyone that might be?
[12:16:22] <Kambfhase> o.O
[12:16:32] <ajpiano> Corren: where's the firm
[12:17:27] <Corren> seattle
[12:18:05] <ajpiano> are you looking for local or remote
[12:18:15] <Corren> ideally local tbh
[12:18:38] <Corren> we hae a really great dynamic going with 4 people all local
[12:18:57] <ajpiano> ofc !
[12:19:01] <ajpiano> do you have a website
[12:19:17] <ajpiano> i can put out some feelers maybe if i can refer folks somewhere
[12:19:26] <Corren> ofc?
[12:19:34] <ajpiano> of course
[12:19:38] <Corren> ah
[12:19:47] <Corren> we don't offically have a website yet
[12:19:57] <Corren> this is about the best reference at this time
[12:20:00] <Corren> http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/25/microsoft-yahoo-vet-starts-clipboard-social-media-with-a-purpose/
[12:20:26] <ajpiano> are you gary flake?
[12:20:28] <Corren> no
[12:20:45] <Corren> I'm Ken
[12:20:52] <ajpiano> oh.  i learnt about the source of the name gary's popularity earlier today
[12:21:01] <Corren> the darth vader part or...
[12:21:23] <Corren> !g darth vader of the internets
[12:21:29] <Corren> no bot eh? :S
[12:21:33] <ajpiano> ?g darth vader of the internets
[12:21:39] <ajpiano> omg
[12:21:42] <ajpiano> bot-ty
[12:21:52] <ajpiano> bot is usually here but he has really been flakin' it up
[12:22:03] <ajpiano> of late
[12:22:09] <ajpiano> we all really miss him terribly :(
[12:22:23] <Corren> no biggie, it was an obscure slashdot comment about gary a few years ago
[12:22:30] <ajpiano> AH.
[12:22:31] <ajpiano> gotcha
[12:22:43] <ajpiano> apparently it owes to gary cooper changing his name to gary, after the town in indiana
[12:23:18] <Corren> oic
[12:26:03] <ajpiano> Corren: what is the best way to get in touch if someone comes up?
[12:29:49] <abjorn> the lack of bot-t makes me sad
[12:29:56] <abjorn> ?WHEREAREYOU
[12:30:46] <serio> the whole world morns the death of bot-t
[12:31:09] <abjorn> bot-t === randy savage ?
[12:31:32] <snover> abjorn: bot-t was raptured
[12:31:40] <abjorn> go figure
[12:31:42] <snover> it turns out, it was just for the robots
[12:31:55] <abjorn> ah that explains everything
[12:32:02] <abjorn> I guess God is an irc-bot
[12:32:14] <crab> am i missing some (easy) way in jquery itself to take document.location(.search) and set or add a specific query parameter to it?
[12:32:18] <TC_> I'm getting severely irritated.
[12:32:19] <hobs> makes sense
[12:32:26] <hobs> well dont get mad, get glad
[12:33:04] <TC_> lol
[12:33:04] <crab> e.g. given /foo?x=1, i want /foo?x=1&new=3, or /foo?new=2 becomes /foo?new=3
[12:33:15] <SoulRaven> please help me with a problem, how i detect is a query from ajax call, is null, or is not contain any element or data
[12:33:36] <crab> soulraven: detect where?
[12:33:37] <snover> hobs: your corporate overlords have taught you well
[12:33:53] <SoulRaven> in :success
[12:33:54] <TC_> Basically, I have: http://pastebin.com/1n3ZRfVq and it uses setTimeouts, and to be frankly honest - it works. Only the problem is, the setTimeouts eventually stop working. The chat kind of freezes and you ahve to close and reopen it to get it working again.
[12:33:57] <TC_> It's not a server issue but only..
[12:34:00] <TC_> it's not only my issue.
[12:34:13] <TC_> My mates stops working instantly... my other mates stops workin after a few seconds.
[12:34:24] <TC_> Mines about a few minutes.
[12:34:29] <TC_> Wondering if the code is buggy?
[12:34:34] <hobs> you got it snover
[12:34:35] <TC_> >.< because it's severely irritating.
[12:34:38] <hobs> ive been brainwashed
[12:34:41] <snover> TC_: $ is not your own personal namespace
[12:34:53] <snover> stop putting all your shit on it
[12:34:59] <hobs> however the idea to not be overwhelmed in the face of irritation is a good one
[12:35:05] <TC_> that can't be the problem though...
[12:35:50] <snover> Your clearTimeouts make absolutely no sense
[12:35:59] <snover> you are defining a function local variable
[12:36:02] <snover> and then existing the function
[12:36:13] <SoulRaven> crab: any ideea? i want to display a message when no data is returning from ajax query
[12:36:15] <Jonrus> Guys I'm using jquery hover to show a tooltip but one of the methods is breaking and calling all my Array.prototype methods. It's playing havoc with my code and I can't work it out - http://pastie.org/1947729
[12:36:18] <TC_> I tried to get it to work.
[12:36:23] <TC_> so I put it in
[12:36:28] <snover> when you invoke the function a second time you have a completely new scope
[12:36:54] <snover> dont set the timeout again until after the server returns data (in the success function)
[12:37:14] <TC_> so, use the setTimeout in the success?
[12:37:37] <crab> soulraven: i usually return a json response like {"rows":[{...}, {...}]} and use (if res.rows.length == 0) to detect "no matching rows", plus an ajax error handler to detect http errors.
[12:37:41] <TC_> and remove the clear timeouts
[12:38:20] <SoulRaven> crab: and i dont't use json? is any solution?
[12:39:16] <crab> i dunno. what format do you use? check if the response is an empty string or something?
[12:39:43] <SoulRaven> i return html format
[12:41:06] <khurram> hi all
[12:41:26] <hobs> hine
[12:41:40] <crab> so take the string, turn it into a jquery object, and use a selector to count the result elements.
[12:43:33] <crab> $('<ul><li>a</li><li>b</li><li>c</li></ul>').find('li').length => 3
[12:43:49] <khurram> i have a textfield in my form which asks user to enter his name. now on keyEnter event of javascript i count the number of keys he pressed , Can a person break this javascript or hack this javascript using a BOT without actually typing the
[12:44:02] <khurram> keys and raising the keypress event on my textfield ?
[12:44:20] <crab> of course.
[12:44:51] <khurram> crab: how can he do this ?
[12:44:56] <TC_> I made the changes you suggested snover, but it still occurs?
[12:45:25] <crab> submit the form without evaluating any of the javascript.
[12:46:12] <DannyZB> Guys , a question : I made a facebook app based on jQuery/Ajax , and developed it on chrome/firefox
[12:46:16] <TC_> http://pastebin.com/Y8SSKUvp it's now like this
[12:46:17] <snover> TC_: there are already probably at least 10 different long-poll chat implementations, go find one
[12:46:28] <crab> i suppose i should enquire if you are trying to break something or prevent someone else from breaking something. :-)
[12:46:37] <khurram> when he will submit the form without evaluating the javascript then he has not raised any keypress event which means keypress event did not recoreded any value at the server using Ajax and thus he is not a human is that right
[12:46:41] <DannyZB> when I tried running it on IE .. it seems like it sometimes just doesn't load the iframe + just stops executing jQuery calls
[12:46:53] <DannyZB> anyone have any experience with issues like that?
[12:46:53] <TC_> I've tried them all, I'm kind of reluctant to base my site around loads of 3rd party apps.
[12:46:57] <TC_> only required ones, eg: jQuery.
[12:47:10] <TC_> otherwiser my site will simply be made up of premade crap and none of it being my own
[12:47:26] <crab> khurram: wait, what?
[12:47:39] <DannyZB> is there any way to debug jQuery code? it never throws any errors
[12:47:42] <crab> what are you actually trying to do?
[12:48:18] <crab> dannyzb: in sufficiently recent versions of IE, there are some developer tools including a console of sorts with an error log
[12:48:30] <khurram> i mean to say to recognize if the user is human or not i have asked him to enter the value into the text field. And then when he presses a key on the keyboard i get the keypress event and do the ajax to the server and record
[12:48:35] <crab> i found it painful to use, but it worked well enough to track down some minor javascript error.
[12:48:36] <khurram> the value
[12:48:58] <DannyZB> crab: thats the thing .. IE isn't throwing any errors
[12:49:04] <khurram> this way i can be 100% sure he is human raising the keypress events on the keyboard not a BOT
[12:49:12] <crab> dannyzb: good luck then :-)
[12:49:18] <DannyZB> I have a link that opens ajax in a div ... it sometimes just stops working altogether
[12:49:22] <TC_> but this issue isn't just happening with the chat script, I'm going ot be having an update of a user lastActive... so I need it fixed so I can get that sorted too.
[12:49:27] <crab> khurram: and what's to stop someonething from forging your ajax requests then?
[12:49:52] <crab> er, someone/thing
[12:50:08] <DannyZB> it only happens in IE .. someone here must've run into this problem
[12:50:18] <khurram> how would you forge a Ajax ? you have to raise an keypress event for the ajax to do ajax
[12:50:45] <Follow|BRNDN> jqueryy!!!! w000000000t
[12:51:03] <DannyZB> whoever hates explorer say aye
[12:51:08] <Follow|BRNDN> aye
[12:51:11] <hobs> aye
[12:51:15] <hobs> aye aye captain
[12:51:16] <crab> if i inspect your page source, i suppose i can figure out what you're doing on keypress and do the same thing.
[12:52:23] <crab> so i guess you'll defeat random useragents that submit values to your form, but nothing that's actually putting any effort into forging requests
[12:52:39] <pifantastic> ?g selenium @ khurram
[12:52:45] <pifantastic> damnit
[12:53:14] <khurram> pifantastic what is selenium
[12:53:17] <khurram> @ khurram
[12:53:37] <hobs> a test suite iirc
[12:53:43] <hobs> http://seleniumhq.org/
[12:54:17] <albacker> i'm trying to do a jquery get request to a youtube page and this is the code i have http://pastebin.com/viAyJczN . the problem is that the alert(); is never executed, and the url is ok according to http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_jsonc.html . If the alert() is not executed that means that no data is received from youtube, right?
[12:55:03] <khurram> well some one forging the request has to be human and thats what my script cares a bot can't do it right?
[12:56:44] <pifantastic> khurram: Your assumption that someone forging requests has to be human is very wrong
[12:57:00] <crab> well, bots are written by humans too :-)
[12:57:03] <pifantastic> khurram: why dont you just use a well tested captcha like recaptcha?
[12:57:34] <pifantastic> http://www.google.com/recaptcha
[12:58:02] <khurram> hmmm then i have lots of people how master the ocr and after few days they can make a special OCR to hack / crack any captcha noise etc.etc
[12:58:12] <pifantastic> albacker: You cannot make cross-domain Ajax requests
[12:58:32] <pifantastic> oh, wait, you're using JSONP
[12:58:36] <snover> khurram: are you kidding me?
[12:59:04] <pifantastic> albacker: you need to use JSONP http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[12:59:20] <albacker> pifantastic, by replacing jsonc with json is working.
[12:59:38] <albacker> pifantastic, thanks for the help
[12:59:48] <khurram> well to be honest all captchas use javascript ajax some how so if the person doesn't evaluate javascript then no captcha can work
[13:00:05] <pifantastic> khurram: that's not necessarily true
[13:00:17] <pifantastic> "all captchas use javascript ajax" is wrong
[13:00:30] <snover> the subset all captchas use javascript is also wrong
[13:00:51] <khurram> any example of captchas which do not use javascript ?
[13:01:03] <pifantastic> http://www.google.com/recaptcha http://www.google.com/recaptcha http://www.google.com/recaptcha http://www.google.com/recaptcha
[13:02:13] <Jarred> So I'm new to jQuery
[13:02:19] <Jarred> and I'm having trouble getting the accordion working
[13:02:44] <Follow|BRNDN> make sure toinclude both UI and core javascript files
[13:02:58] <Jarred> I did that
[13:03:27] <Follow|BRNDN> stylessheets aswell?
[13:03:41] <pifantastic> Jarred: make sure your code is either at the bottom of the page or inside of a $(document).ready(function() {    });
[13:03:43] <Jarred> I downloaded the whole folder in the RoR public folder
[13:03:50] <Jarred> it is
[13:03:56] <Follow|BRNDN> link me
[13:04:11] <Jarred> http://pastebin.com/Y7pYzUj9
[13:04:32] <Jarred> It's probably something really stupid
[13:04:38] <Follow|BRNDN> you aren't even calling the accordion function
[13:04:49] <Kambfhase> Jarred: do select the div this the id accordeon us #accorden
[13:05:03] <TC_> So does anyone know why setTimeout/setInterval may stop working on ones browser and have to refresh in order to get it to work again?
[13:05:18] <Jarred> isn't that what it does on click?
[13:05:27] <Follow|BRNDN> $('#accordion').accordion();
[13:05:50] <Kambfhase> Jarred: that is not even valid JavaScript.
[13:05:55] <Follow|BRNDN> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/ => VIEW PAGE SOURCE
[13:06:11] <Follow|BRNDN> kamb is correct
[13:06:31] <Jarred> As I said, I'm just learning this stuff
[13:06:37] <Follow|BRNDN> yeh.
[13:06:41] <Follow|BRNDN> don't start with UI.
[13:06:49] <Follow|BRNDN> learn basic jquery functions first
[13:06:59] <crab> pifantastic: wait, if it's at the bottom of the page, it doesn't need to be inside .ready?
[13:07:02] <Follow|BRNDN> you're just copying and pasting
[13:07:13] <Jarred> Yeah, I normally copy/paste and then figure out it how itworks
[13:07:19] <Jarred> *figure out how oit works
[13:07:25] <Follow|BRNDN> yes, i can tell.
[13:07:33] <Follow|BRNDN> you need closing brackets
[13:07:35] <Kambfhase> well, looks like you forgot to copy some parts
[13:07:45] <hilko_> not a bad approach per s, when it's combined with following some tutorials :)
[13:07:56] <Follow|BRNDN> put that snippet into jslint.com
[13:08:09] <Follow|BRNDN> just the javascript
[13:08:13] <Follow|BRNDN> you'll see the errors
[13:11:38] <khurram> why dont google uses reCaptcha on gmail new login forms ?
[13:12:09] <hobs> I honestly dont know that seems like they should
[13:12:35] <khurram> they use hidden fields on gmail new login forms
[13:14:26] <BinaryKitten> nobody likes captcha
[13:15:02] <BinaryKitten> no one that i have heard of that are of sane mind and body go around saying ... ooh i wish this site had more captcha tests...
[13:15:12] <khurram> then what is wrong with detecting the keypress event that way atleast you are sure The person was  human
[13:15:33] <khurram> cuz he raised they keypress event
[13:15:42] <BinaryKitten> because you can fake it
[13:15:58] <BinaryKitten> .trigger('keypress')
[13:16:04] <BinaryKitten> or a myriad of ways
[13:16:17] <BinaryKitten> also without javascript on, everyone would be considered a boy
[13:16:19] <BinaryKitten> *bot
[13:16:27] <khurram> hmmm
[13:16:33] <BinaryKitten> though not quite sure which is worse, being a boy or a bot
[13:16:48] <Zerxer> I'd rather be a bot
[13:16:53] <BinaryKitten> I think i'd rather be a bot too..
[13:16:57] <Zerxer> then I'd get all the girls, like bot-t
[13:16:58] <khurram> then you have problems with the expert who can write special OCR to break a special good captcha
[13:17:03] <BinaryKitten> fem-bot :D
[13:17:26] <BinaryKitten> khurram captchas are not meant to be a security device to stop access
[13:17:29] <khurram> fem-bot should be called bottex cuz bot is a male generally
[13:17:37] <BinaryKitten> though they have been used for that
[13:17:37] <tlhokomelo> Hella@all
[13:17:43] <khurram> hmm
[13:18:06] <Zerxer> what's a captcha's main purpose then
[13:18:22] <BinaryKitten> to provided a check for automated repetition
[13:18:32] <BinaryKitten> and to help lower the amount that happens
[13:18:33] <khurram> just to make sure the request came from a human
[13:18:55] <dtach> BinaryKitten: hi there, im back. How are you
[13:19:02] <BinaryKitten> still hungry
[13:19:02] <tlhokomelo> Hi @xenyz
[13:19:04] <BinaryKitten> lol
[13:19:10] <Zerxer> hm I'm hungry too
[13:19:27] <Zerxer> I never had cat before, but if you'll step up on this grill, I'm willing to give it a try

[13:38:23] <khurram> ok most of the sites uses javascript for better client experience and convenience , so can i detect if the browser had javascript enabled or disabled ?
[13:50:31] <dabear> ?p @ denisbr

[14:24:18] <pifantastic> Ichigo: Why are you using $(window).load instead of $(document).ready ?
[14:25:28] <Ichigo> pifantastic, I don't know, ask whoever made the tutorial/script
[14:25:53] <pifantastic> Ichigo: Also, the plugin docs say you need a wrapping div with class horWrapper
[14:25:56] <pifantastic> you do not have that
[14:26:29] <Ichigo> "horWrapper"?
[14:26:35] <pifantastic> "The markup for horizontal scrollers needs an additional div with class name horWrapper that wraps the .container div. This is necessary in order to set the total width of contents automatically, without the need to insert it by hand in css or make complicated calculations with javascript."
[14:26:43] <pifantastic> Did you read http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller ?
[14:26:46] <Ichigo> This is verticle
[14:26:50] <Ichigo> Not horizontal
[14:26:59] <pifantastic> very good point sir
[14:27:27] <Ichigo> Hahah.
[14:37:41] <thathurts> i'm looping through an array and doing a var string = "blah"; $("#tablebody").append(blah);   and it seems like it's pretty slow. what's the fastest way to build a table dynamically?
[14:38:08] <wkmanire> thathurts: You want to reduce the number of DOM manips to as few as possible.
[14:38:29] <wkmanire> thathurts: For organization's sake take a look at jQuery.tmpl.
[14:39:05] <wkmanire> thathurts: To elaborate on the DOM manipulations bit, you'd want to build out your whole HTML fragment and do a single append.
[14:39:31] <thathurts> oh all right. i was under the impression that long string builders were expensive
[14:39:39] <K1ng> someone please recommend me a jquery file uploader
[14:39:50] <fra79Wii> hi, I have an XML which was parsed in the client with jquery... Now I would like to download it.. how can i do? window.location.href = myXML (I know can't be this way...)...
[14:39:56] <wkmanire> thathurts: Sure, but if you think about what is happening doing it one little piece at a time...
[14:40:13] <thathurts> wkmanire: yup. makes sense. thanks al ot
[14:40:15] <wkmanire> thathurts: Append a string, create a DOM element, put it into the DOM tree, DOM reflow, append a string, create a DOM element....
[14:40:49] <wkmanire> np
[14:41:24] <wkmanire> K1ng: uploadify is the first result in my google query.
[14:41:29] <K1ng> its gay
[14:41:47] <wkmanire> K1ng: See if you can find a hetero one then.
[14:43:03] <wkmanire> fra79Wii: That window.location.href assignment won't work, but the thing is different browsers have different file associations.
[14:43:22] <wkmanire> So even if you do load a document with XML type, some browsers will just display it.
[14:43:34] <wkmanire> I'm not sure what a good answer is.
[14:44:08] <K1ng> wkmanire, http://www.plupload.com
[14:44:16] <K1ng> 100% better then uploadify :D
[14:45:07] <fra79Wii> wkmanire: thanks, yes I see... but is ok.. I mean, I guess I'll support only crome and ff4...and by the way the user might use the 'save as' option in this case...
[14:45:57] <wkmanire> fra79Wii: That makes sense.
[14:46:54] <wkmanire> K1ng: Looks nice
[14:47:23] <fra79Wii> so how should I do... I really can't find anything anywhere.. I would avoid to do anything at server-side...
[14:47:55] <wkmanire> K1ng: It just crashed my chrome tab.
[14:47:57] <wkmanire> :/
[14:48:06] <K1ng> its works fine for me :p
[14:48:08] <fra79Wii> just open a new tab/window whith the .data()
[14:48:58] <wkmanire> fra79Wii: Need to set the mime type to text/xml
[14:49:25] <wkmanire> to be honest, I've never tried to do that from the client side before.
[14:50:05] <wkmanire> Try doing document.open('text/xml')
[14:50:19] <wkmanire> then document.write(myxml);
[14:50:21] <wkmanire> document.close()
[14:51:22] <fra79Wii> thanks man, it's a start...
[15:01:07] <njbair> hey real quick before the world ends, does anybody know how to reload a jquery tab?
[15:02:55] <Ichigo> I really can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here.
[15:03:04] <Ichigo> I've copied everything exactly as it specified
[15:03:08] <Ichigo> But it's doing absolutely nothing
[15:03:17] <Ichigo> I'm completely utterly lost.
[15:03:38] <Ichigo> This literally makes no sense to me.
[15:04:26] <Ichigo> I really would sincerely appreciate any help here.
[15:05:15] <Ichigo> Because I'm really about at the point of giving up. This is ludicrus :/
[15:07:40] <Ichigo> Ugh. Okay, then does anyone have any other jQuery scrollers they can recommend that aren't nearly impossible to implament properly?
[15:08:27] <Ichigo> I've beyond lost patience with this freaking script
[15:08:44] <Ichigo> I've done everything EXACTLY as it specifies and it doesn't work for no logical reason

[15:23:41] <matias> Hello
[15:23:41] <Whirl3d> CamerOn, try a loop   for (var i=0;i<n;i++) {$(holder).append("<div class='blank'>&nbsp;</div>");}
[15:23:52] <Camer0n> um ok
[15:24:00] <Whirl3d> CamerOn, there are better ways I am sure, but that should work
[15:24:47] <matias> yourHolder=$(holder); for(...) {  yourHolder.append(...); } //would be better
[15:25:07] <Whirl3d> true
[15:25:08] <Camer0n> thanks, I'm really bad with js
[15:25:55] <Camer0n> so how would I actually use this?
[15:26:04] <Whirl3d> of course you could also do : var html=""; for (..) {html+="<div></div>"}; $(holder).append(html)
[15:26:13] <Camer0n> could someone give an example on jsfiddle.net
[15:26:13] <sunscreen> tnx Whirl3d
[15:26:15] <Camer0n> please
[15:26:29] <Whirl3d> suncsreen, np
[15:27:25] <Ichigo> I'm trying to get a scrollbar working here, http://josh.nizu.us - It should be similar to this scrollbar: http://josh.nizu.us/js/jquery-scroll/jquery_custom_scrollbar_vertical.html But I'm not having any luck. I'm probably missing something stupid, but would appreciate any help.
[15:32:24] <Camer0n> anyone?
[15:33:12] <mykul> Camer0n what>
[15:33:13] <mykul> ?
[15:33:53] <Camer0n> could someone give an example on jsfiddle.net of how ot use for (var i=0;i<n;i++) {$(holder).append("<div class='blank'>&nbsp;</div>");} or yourHolder=$(holder); for(...) {  yourHolder.append(...); }
[15:34:28] <Camer0n> to make a drop down menu that selects te number of textboxes in a form to dipslay
[15:34:53] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TcFks/7/
[15:35:09] <Camer0n> I need to be able to add individual names to the inputs automatically (like box1,2,3) and there is more than one text box per item
[15:35:15] <Whirl3d> CamerOn, it's not a dropdown menu, but it gives you the idea
[15:35:39] <Zxurian> does anyone know of a way to apply a function to multiple variables (that are DOM elements) ala this method? - http://jsfiddle.net/pWJgp/1/
[15:35:59] <Camer0n> that looks ok but I want to be able to click 7 and it shows 7 blocks or click 3 and removes the extra 4
[15:36:50] <Whirl3d> Zxurian, try $(items).each(function () {apply
[15:38:14] <Whirl3d> CamerOn, here is what you asked for. Now, we're not gonna do all your homework for you, so try it yourself first, then ask for help. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TcFks/9/
[15:38:26] <Camer0n> ok
[15:38:31] <Ichigo> BAHHH..
[15:38:41] <Zxurian> tried every permutation I could thank of on that Whirl3d, no go
[15:38:41] <Ichigo> I don't understand this
[15:38:42] <Ichigo> at all
[15:38:48] <Whirl3d> Ichigo, I share your frustration. I can never get custom scrollbars to work
[15:38:55] <Ichigo> \o/.
[15:39:01] <Camer0n> (it's not homework if that's what you're sugesting lol)
[15:39:21] <Ichigo> Glad I'm not the only one then
[15:39:33] <mykul> he's suggesting you write your own code
[15:39:35] <Whirl3d> Ichigo, it's working fine for me
[15:39:46] <Camer0n> i know
[15:39:48] <Ichigo> Whirl3d, On /my/ site?
[15:39:51] <Ichigo> Not the example
[15:39:53] <Whirl3d> lol
[15:39:59] <Whirl3d> where's your site?
[15:39:59] <Camer0n> i can now i think, I just needed an example to get me going
[15:40:06] <mykul> cool
[15:40:07] <Ichigo> http://josh.nizu.us
[15:40:07] <Camer0n> I'm very new to javascript
[15:40:27] <Zxurian> neveremind, I got it Whirl3d, was forgetting the needed function() inside the each
[15:40:30] <Whirl3d> Ichigo, what are you trying to scroll?
[15:40:37] <Ichigo> The content section
[15:40:46] <Ichigo> Where it cuts off just a bit above the footer
[15:40:49] <Ichigo> and scrolls from thereon
[15:41:25] <Whirl3d> ichigo, I don't see any content at all on your site
[15:41:28] <Zxurian> $([obj1,obj2,obj3...]).each(function(){ $(this).doStuff(); }); in case anyone has the same issue
[15:41:33] <Ichigo> Whirl3d, Click on "About me"
[15:42:01] <Ichigo> You may need to resize your browser window if your resoltuion is to big
[15:42:12] <bingomanatee> @ryan: what specific conditions cause a block of code to be put onto an entry into the node event system?
[15:42:22] <bingomanatee> @rayh  ^ ^
[15:43:47] <Whirl3d> Ichigo, without learning that specific plugin's details, I won't be of any help. You should ask the plugin author for help or maybe someone else has used it, but I haven't. Sorry
[15:43:50] <trond-> q: does anyone know of a table header plugin that creates a dropdown/dropdown-list that can be used as filtering the items in that column?
[15:43:58] <mykul> Zxurian there is also: $.each([foo,bar], function(i,el){$(el).html("hooray");});
[15:44:14] <mykul> as an alternative if you're interested
[15:44:14] <matias> is there any event to capture when someone check/uncheck a checkbox?
[15:44:36] <mykul> it might have an onChange
[15:44:40] <bingomanatee> yes - onChange / onBlur
[15:44:44] <Ichigo> Whirl3d, http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller this is the plugin authors homepage if that's of any help.
[15:45:29] <Whirl3d> Ichigo, I wish that I had the time to learn a custom scrollbar implementation to help you out, but I'm here asking for help just like you are...sorry.
[15:45:34] <Zxurian> interesting, thanks mykul
[15:45:44] <Ichigo> ahah. No problem, thanks anyways
[15:45:52] <Zxurian> i'm assuming that "i" in that function will return the index of the element currently being worked on?
[15:45:53] <Camer0n> what's wrong with what I'm doing Whirl3d?
[15:45:55] <matias> oh, nevermind, .click() works perfect with checkbox
[15:46:01] <mykul> Zxurian, yes
[15:46:16] <Whirl3d> Ichigo, you need to load Jquery UI
[15:46:18] <mykul> matias, be careful with click, because someone can check a box with the keyboard
[15:46:36] <matias> it works too
[15:46:39] <Whirl3d> ichigo, the first line on the scrollbar site says that it uses jquery UI and you aren't loading it
[15:46:50] <Camer0n> http://jsfiddle.net/TcFks/10/
[15:46:54] <matias> should I use .change anyway?
[15:46:55] <mykul> matias, you da boss
[15:47:01] <mykul> i'd use change
[15:47:51] <Whirl3d> CamerOn...putting on my psychic helmut to figure out what you are doing before I can figure out what's wrong...sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
[15:48:03] <matias> ok hehe
[15:48:05] <matias> thanks
[15:48:11] <Camer0n> ...?
[15:48:18] <matias> (I wonder what "you da boss" means)
[15:48:20] <Camer0n> http://jsfiddle.net/TcFks/10/ ^^^^^^^
[15:48:33] <mykul> matias, roughly, "do what you want"
[15:48:40] <Ichigo> Whirl3d, All these things conflict with each other
[15:48:45] <Ichigo> The different jQuery scripts I use
[15:48:49] <Whirl3d> CamerOn, you are trying to use the click event with the select element
[15:48:53] <Ichigo> Seem to call on different versions of the same thing
[15:49:10] <Whirl3d> you need to get the value of the select element using .val(), I believe.
[15:49:51] <Ichigo> Whirl3d, I do have it included though
[15:49:52] <Whirl3d> Ichigo, I would suggest paring it down and only use the ones that work together. They shouldn't break other scripts if they are well-written.
[15:50:05] <Ichigo>     <SCRIPT SRC="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/jquery-ui.min.js" TYPE="text/javascript"></SCRIPT>
[15:50:05] <Whirl3d> Ichigo, it's not showing up for some reason.
[15:50:16] <mykul> Camer0n: http://jsfiddle.net/TcFks/11/
[15:50:18] <matias> haha ok, change seems ok too
[15:50:43] <Camer0n> ok, thanks!
[15:50:50] <mykul> note how i changed the selecor to the select element and listened to the change event
[15:51:17] <mykul> then got n by finding the ':selected' element's text
[15:51:28] <mykul> not sure if it's the cleanest but it works
[15:52:16] <mykul> also, rather than using .append, which preserves the contents of #holder, we use .html to replace the contents
[15:52:46] <Ichigo> Whirl3d, Is it really not? I don't see why, it's clearly defined, view the source yourself
[15:54:14] <Whirl3d> Ichigo, I only see glowing, color, tools, and  josh.nisu.us
[15:55:02] <Camer0n> why isn't this working now: http://jsfiddle.net/TcFks/12/
[15:55:08] <Ichigo> You don't see:
[15:55:09] <Ichigo>     <SCRIPT SRC="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/jquery-ui.min.js" TYPE="text/javascript"></SCRIPT>
[15:55:22] <Camer0n> i want it to have a default value if nothing has been selected yet
[15:55:51] <fra79Wii> hmmm.. a stupid question, can I manage to make a document.write() opening another window and not rewriting on my actual page?
[15:55:52] <Camer0n> oh i see
[15:55:59] <Camer0n> i could just put it in holder
[15:56:11] <mykul> awww yeaah
[15:56:42] <Whirl3d> brb, I'm gonna reboot my browser
[15:57:30] <Ichigo> I know for a 100% fact I have jquery-ui.min.js included..
[15:57:36] <Ichigo> There's no logical reasoning here
[16:00:31] <fra79Wii> ..never mind I've managed :)
[16:00:43] <mykul> cool fra79Wii
[16:01:42] <Ichigo> I'll give a cookie to anyone who can figure out what's wrong.
[16:01:47] <Ichigo> Freshly baked.
[16:02:35] <mykul> oh man
[16:07:08] <mykul> Ichigo are you loading jquery.mCustomScrollbar.css
[16:07:42] <Ichigo> mykul, Yes
[16:07:50] <mykul> i dont see it in resources
[16:07:52] <Ichigo> view-source:http://josh.nizu.us/
[16:08:11] <Ichigo> HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
[16:08:20] <Ichigo>     <LINK REL="STYLECHEET" HREF="js/jquery-scroll/jquery.mCustomScrollbar.css">
[16:08:23] <Ichigo> StyleCheet.
[16:08:25] <mykul> lewl
[16:08:48] <mykul> now
[16:08:52] <mykul> my fucking cookie
[16:08:52] <Ichigo> Are you freaking kidding me
[16:08:55] <mykul> :D
[16:08:57] <Camer0n> what's wrong with this: http://jsfiddle.net/2F6dF/
[16:09:16] <Ichigo> I've spent probably over an hour trying to figure this out
[16:09:23] <Ichigo> and it was because of a typo
[16:09:34] * Ichigo hands mykul a box of freshly baked cookies
[16:09:35] <mykul> yeah, always check your inspector's resources tab
[16:09:59] <Ichigo> Now I just have to modify it to work properly I guess
[16:10:00] * mykul saves them for later
[16:10:06] <mykul> right on
[16:10:12] <mykul> good luck with your site
[16:10:20] <Ichigo> hah, thanks ^^.
[16:10:44] <mykul> Camer0n, what are you trying t do
[16:10:55] <Camer0n> same as earlier
[16:11:25] <Camer0n> basically
[16:11:35] <mykul> Camer0n, what browser are you running
[16:11:42] <Camer0n> chrome
[16:11:44] <mykul> do you know about the console?
[16:11:53] <Camer0n> choose a value from the drop down menu and it shows the number of items
[16:11:58] <Camer0n> err no?
[16:12:27] <mykul> the console is a javascript command line
[16:12:38] <Camer0n> ok :/
[16:12:40] <mykul> to interact with the DOM and whatnor
[16:12:41] <ryanneufeld> and it shows any errors
[16:12:45] <mykul> ^^
[16:12:54] <ryanneufeld> also you can use firebug in firefox
[16:13:02] <ryanneufeld> I personally prefer firebug
[16:14:10] <mykul> Camer0n, right click someone on the jsfiddle page
[16:14:16] <mykul> and click on inspect element
[16:14:22] <mykul> this brings up the inspector
[16:14:29] <mykul> which should have  atab for the console
[16:14:57] <Camer0n> yeah
[16:15:02] <mykul> you will see Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'change' of null
[16:15:12] <Camer0n> yep
[16:15:23] <mykul> which is referring to $("select").change(function
[16:15:31] <mykul> if you type in $(
[16:15:34] <mykul> er
[16:15:42] <mykul> $('select')
[16:15:45] <ryanneufeld> care to re-share the fiddle link?
[16:15:49] <mykul> sure enough it returns null
[16:15:51] <Camer0n> http://jsfiddle.net/2F6dF/
[16:16:01] <mykul> the problem is broken markup
[16:16:55] <Camer0n> no that doesnt fix it
[16:16:59] <mykul> you aren't closing some h2 and h3 tags
[16:17:15] <Camer0n> http://jsfiddle.net/2F6dF/1/
[16:18:24] <Camer0n> http://jsfiddle.net/2F6dF/2/ still no working
[16:18:29] <Camer0n> *not
[16:19:03] <ryanneufeld> uhm
[16:19:11] <ryanneufeld> cause there is no such thing as a <select> element
[16:19:28] <Camer0n> yeah there is
[16:19:32] <ryanneufeld> <input type="select"><option></option></input>
[16:19:42] * mykul smacks forehead
[16:19:49] <ryanneufeld> Uh, no there isn't :p
[16:20:03] <mykul> sorry Camer0n i led you astray
[16:20:11] <mykul> in the last example
[16:20:35] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[16:20:40] <Camer0n> bu- there isn't though... http://jsfiddle.net/2F6dF/4/
[16:20:41] <ryanneufeld> k,  I was mistaken
[16:20:43] <fra79Wii> ok, I've managed to work only on client side... open a new window parsing an XML into a CSV and wrinting it in the new window, so far is ok, on Firefox is working and I could make 'save as', but in chromium the 'save as' option is disables, as well with view source ..inspect element.. is some weird sicurity configuration?
[16:21:29] <Camer0n> lol
[16:22:19] <mykul> you're gunna love this
[16:22:29] <Camer0n> am i?
[16:22:34] <mykul> you are using mootools in this fiffle
[16:22:38] <mykul> fiddle
[16:22:54] <Camer0n> huh?
[16:23:03] <ryanneufeld> HAHAHAHHAA
[16:23:07] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, I just found that
[16:23:10] <ryanneufeld> I was mistaken
[16:23:14] <ryanneufeld> there is a select
[16:23:29] <ryanneufeld> but you didn't have jquery selected as an include
[16:23:35] <Camer0n> doh!
[16:23:39] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/2F6dF/6/
[16:23:41] <mykul> glhf guys
[16:23:43] <ryanneufeld> fixed :)
[16:23:49] <Camer0n> yeay!
[16:23:57] <ryanneufeld> also, I wrapped your code in a document ready
[16:24:13] <mykul> also, tables give me the sad
[16:24:20] <ryanneufeld> yes, tables make me very sad
[16:24:39] <Camer0n> but it's not working
[16:24:49] <Ichigo> Well I can see it seems to be styling now..
[16:24:57] <Ichigo> But there's still no scrollbar.. >_>.. hum
[16:25:07] <Ichigo> Still trying to figure out that bit
[16:25:12] <mykul> Ichigo relink
[16:25:13] <Camer0n> that's weird
[16:25:13] <mykul> ?
[16:25:17] <Camer0n> it's goina bouve it
[16:25:19] <Ichigo> http://josh.nizu.us
[16:25:23] <ryanneufeld> Camer0n: it's doing the console.log of ('clicked')
[16:26:01] <mykul> Ichigo yeah looks borked here
[16:26:28] <Camer0n> it's not working again!
[16:27:01] <Ichigo> http://josh.nizu.us/js/jquery-scroll/jquery_custom_scrollbar_vertical.html Was the sample..
[16:27:11] <Ichigo> But not that looks partially borked and jesus christ may only know why
[16:27:52] <matias> !help
[16:28:08] <matias> I can't remember the syntax u.u
[16:28:49] <Ichigo> This is really a big pain in the ass >_>..
[16:29:10] <matias> Freenode really need a bot syntax standard!
[16:29:39] <Ichigo> Freenode doesn't control the syntax bot dev's make o.e
[16:29:52] <matias> they should lol
[16:31:25] <matias> it was something like... !src anything, right?
[16:31:29] <matias> !src append
[16:31:35] <Ichigo> Okay right.
[16:31:36] <Ichigo> http://josh.nizu.us/js/jquery-scroll/jquery_custom_scrollbar_vertical.html
[16:31:42] <Ichigo> Here's the sample, actually proper now
[16:32:29] <Ichigo> I know without the stylehseet it won't work at all
[16:32:40] <Ichigo> and I can style the stylesheet however I want
[16:32:51] <Ichigo> But my problem is even as is, no scrollbars are loading on my site
[16:38:57] <ryanneufeld> Ichigo: what is jquery.tools.min2 doing?
[16:39:26] <ryanneufeld> also have you tried maybe using the latest jquery and latest jquery ui?
[16:39:27] <Ichigo> ryanneufeld, It's for the tabs
[16:39:33] <ryanneufeld> oic
[16:39:42] <Ichigo> ryanneufeld, Aye, right now I'm trying to use the exact versions it's recommending
[16:39:43] <ryanneufeld> try jquery 1.5 or 1.6
[16:39:54] <ryanneufeld> yeah, but the latest jquery UI needs 1.5 I think
[16:40:11] <Ichigo> It's the same ones as in the sample
[16:40:14] <Ichigo> (The sample works)
[16:40:16] <Ichigo> Which uses 1.4
[16:40:18] <Ichigo> :3
[16:40:57] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[16:40:58] <ryanneufeld> http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started#After_downloading:_Intro_to_using_jQuery_UI
[16:41:03] <ryanneufeld> check that oiut
[16:41:05] <ryanneufeld> *out
[16:41:22] <ryanneufeld> not that I think that's your problem
[16:41:41] <Ichigo> Yeah, if I get everything working I have no problem using the latest versions, I'd prefer to
[16:42:20] <ryanneufeld> Then just do it
[16:42:23] <Ichigo> But look at the sample here for reference to what I mean: http://josh.nizu.us/js/jquery-scroll/jquery_custom_scrollbar_vertical.html
[16:42:32] <ryanneufeld> it's all backwards compatible
[16:44:45] <ryanneufeld> you've got something strange going on with your markup
[16:44:50] <ryanneufeld> an extra </script> tag
[16:44:54] <ryanneufeld> also
[16:45:16] <ryanneufeld> is there a reason you're using $(window).load() instead of the usual $(document).ready() ?
[16:45:36] <Ichigo> Someone else here already said that. It's the author developer that's using that not me
[16:45:41] <Ichigo> Er
[16:45:43] <Ichigo> plugin dev*
[16:45:52] <Prot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I482t6JhL4g
[16:46:10] <ryanneufeld> wat is that?
[16:46:17] <Ichigo> http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller
[16:46:18] <coldhead> bot-t got raptured?
[16:46:49] <ryanneufeld> Ichigo: check your markup, and as a stylisitic point, the standard is to use lowercase tagnames these days
[16:47:24] <ryanneufeld> wandering -> wondering :p
[16:49:13] <Ichigo> Hm, upercase just seems to look better to me. Maybe I'm "old fashioned" though >.>
[16:49:44] <ryanneufeld> yeah, lowercase is easier to read and faster to type :p
[16:50:05] <Ichigo> Heh, the second part is definitely true :p
[16:50:27] <ryanneufeld> also, there are a couple functions you didn't include that the original author has
[16:50:38] <ryanneufeld> $.fx.prototype.cur = function(){
[16:50:48] <ryanneufeld> function LoadNewContent(id,file){
[17:09:38] <crankharder> when i call slide down on an element I get no animation.  it's as if it's just plain show() - why would that be?
[17:09:43] <crankharder> slideDown()
[17:10:31] <Ichigo> ryanneufeld, Where did you see those functions?
[17:10:37] <Ichigo> In the sample or the instructions page?
[17:10:38] <coldhead> ?fx.off
[17:10:45] <coldhead> oh no bot-t
[17:11:03] <coldhead> crankharder: you may have animations disabled or you may be passing in a duration of 0
[17:11:05] <ryanneufeld> Ichigo: it's on the main page lower down
[17:11:09] <ryanneufeld> and it's in the demo page
[17:11:23] <crankharder> coldhead: usually i'm calling slideDown('fast', function(){...})
[17:11:23] <coldhead> crankharder: try $('body').fadeOut() in the firebug console
[17:11:41] <crankharder> coldhead: yea, that fades
[17:11:43] <coldhead> just to see if anything is animating
[17:11:48] <coldhead> hmm
[17:12:06] <Ichigo> Ah. for scrolling long content?
[17:12:19] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:12:28] <ryanneufeld> not sure if any of that makes a diff or now
[17:12:30] <ryanneufeld> *not
[17:12:39] <ryanneufeld> but it couldn't hurt
[17:12:51] <Ichigo> Yeah. I think that's if you have really long content, but let me try patching that in
[17:13:32] <coldhead> crankharder: animations only work on elements with display:block -- it may be the switch to that property which is causing it to show instantly?
[17:14:16] <ryanneufeld> aside from that, I'm guessing you messed up the html somehow
[17:14:20] <ner0x> Just wondering, how does everyone test their javascript?
[17:14:28] <ryanneufeld> in a browser
[17:14:30] <ner0x> Selenium, Zombie.js? Or something completely different.
[17:15:10] <snover> coldhead: false
[17:15:40] <snover> ner0x: whats testing?
[17:15:50] <crankharder> coldhead: I had it display:none (to be hidden initially) -- removed that and both slideUp and slideDown still don't animate
[17:16:01] <ner0x> snover: Unit testing?
[17:16:08] <snover> unit what?!
[17:16:23] <Ichigo> ryanneufeld, I added it in without much luck still, sadly
[17:16:51] <ryanneufeld> Ichigo: hmm
[17:16:52] <ner0x> snover: You're messing with me right?
[17:17:02] <ryanneufeld> Ichigo: try lowercase tags?
[17:17:04] <ryanneufeld> lol
[17:17:07] <ryanneufeld> dunno
[17:17:10] <ryanneufeld> out of ideas
[17:17:14] <ryanneufeld> ner0x: http://tinyurl.com/4yu5lg9
[17:17:14] <Ichigo> o_O' lol
[17:17:18] <coldhead> crankharder: i'm sorry, i clearly have no idea
[17:17:42] <ryanneufeld> l8r
[17:17:59] <snover> ner0x: yes!?
[17:18:26] <ner0x> As if I didn't google it first...
[17:19:26] <coldhead> ner0x: http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit
[17:19:53] <zhaozhou_> Is there a way to do canvas operations using standard jquery?
[17:20:34] <ner0x> How did I end up missing QUnit in a search...
[17:20:39] * ner0x goes to check it out.
[17:36:50] <ccarpenterg> hello
[17:38:49] <ccarpenterg> I'm using $.get() to load a JSON response from the server, how do I pass the data to a variable outside of $.get()?
[17:41:04] <thathurts> i'm looping through an array and outputting html fragments with append(). you gave me some good advice to change this to that the entire fragment is build and then added with only one append. the issue, though, is that i also need to add event handlers onto an anchor that gets created during the loop, and if i wait until the end of the loop to append the string fragment, the anchor doesn't
[17:41:04] <thathurts> exist in time to add the event handler to it. any suggestions?
[17:42:26] <snover> use event delegation.
[17:42:59] <snover> Im not sure how there is any difference anyway
[17:43:30] <shaggy_> Hey I'm trying to use .data on this div: <div id="request_response" data-action="accept" data-uid="3">Accept</div> and this is the code I'm using to try to alert the value of uid alert( $('#request_response').data('uid') ); but I just get "null"
[17:45:05] <Ichigo> I'm trying to get a scrollbar working here, http://josh.nizu.us - It should be similar to this scrollbar: http://josh.nizu.us/js/jquery-scroll/jquery_custom_scrollbar_vertical.html But I'm not having any luck. I'm probably missing something stupid, but would appreciate any help.
[17:45:17] <Ichigo> (I'm persistant on getting this to work)
[18:05:10] <ccarpenterg> I have this code: $.get("/", {"id": 1}, function (data) { var points = data });
[18:05:28] <ccarpenterg> and I want to pass the variable points to global context
[18:07:09] <thathurts> then define var = points;  globally at the top of the page
[18:07:15] <ccarpenterg> actually I'm populating an Array inside that function and it works fine, but now I want to make that array accessible
[18:07:17] <thathurts> and change that to { points = data }
[18:07:26] <ccarpenterg> ah
[18:07:33] <ccarpenterg> ok I'm going to try it
[18:17:28] <abs|zer0|> hi
[18:17:38] <abs|zer0|> I have a jquery Autocomplete box in my page
[18:17:47] <abs|zer0|> but I dont' know how to get its value

[18:18:07] <abs|zer0|> please help
[18:18:12] <wkmanire> -459.67F: sup
[18:18:15] <abs|zer0|> $("#my_autocomplete").value() doesnt work
[18:18:57] <wkmanire> abs|zer0|: what about .val()?
[18:19:33] <ccarpenterg> thathurts: it doesn't work
[18:19:46] <abs|zer0|> wkmanire, lol thanks so much man
[18:19:50] <abs|zer0|> <3
[18:19:55] <abs|zer0|> im really new to jquery
[18:20:08] <wkmanire> abs|zer0|: No problem. I like helping cool people.
[18:20:25] <njbair> I'm using .tabs() to turn a ul into an ajax tabset. I want to create a button that will reload the current tab but I can't figure out how to do it.
[18:20:36] <abs|zer0|> wkmanire, thanks again
[18:21:16] <wkmanire> njbair: Do you realy need to reload the whole thing?
[18:21:29] <wkmanire> njbair: Or just the contents of the tab?
[18:21:36] <electronplusplus> Hi
[18:21:45] <wkmanire> electronplusplus: Howdy
[18:21:53] <njbair> wkmanire: just the current tab
[18:21:59] <electronplusplus> I need to take a snap from a WebCam and upload it
[18:22:18] <electronplusplus> I don't want to use flash
[18:22:37] <wkmanire> electronplusplus: Chrome might have something for that since they do have a native webcam thingie.
[18:22:45] <wkmanire> njbair: Can I see your HTML markup?
[18:22:54] <njbair> wkmanire: jas
[18:22:59] <electronplusplus> HTML5 is going to support but not yet
[18:26:32] <njbair> wkmanire: http://pastebin.com/r4Ngx5zE
[18:28:04] <wkmanire> njbair: Ok, Can you show me what it looks like after it has been rendered?
[18:28:08] <wkmanire> As in, what goes to the client
[18:28:22] <njbair> wkmanire: yeah... i'll throw the js in there too
[18:28:31] <wkmanire> njbair: Let's set up a jsfiddle.
[18:30:03] <njbair> wkmanire: ok
[18:33:11] <^robertj> howdy all
[18:33:37] <^robertj> what's the best way to attach a custom callback function to an element?
[18:33:52] <wkmanire> ^robertj: For an event?
[18:33:54] <^robertj> I want to ad an on_dropped function to an element to call from a drag target's drop
[18:33:55] <^robertj> yeah
[18:34:38] <wkmanire> jqueryui provides functionality for draggable and droppable.
[18:34:51] <wkmanire> You can create custom events using bind.
[18:34:52] <^robertj> yes i'm using it
[18:35:30] <wkmanire> $(anything).bind('on_dropped.mynamespace', customHandler);
[18:35:39] <wkmanire> Then when you want to trigger the event....
[18:36:01] <wkmanire> $(anything).trigger('on_dropped.mynamespace', /* optional event data */);
[18:36:10] <^robertj> ahh
[18:36:25] <^robertj> that sounds like it will work fine, i'm not missing anything obvious with the D&D functionality though right?
[18:36:28] <wkmanire> The namespacing thing is optional, but I think its a good practice
[18:36:41] <wkmanire> There might be some existing events you can tie into.
[18:36:58] <wkmanire> I haven't used draggable/droppable all that much. Just take a read through the docs to make sure.
[18:37:11] <wkmanire> You can bind events to anything by the way, not just elements.
[18:39:18] <luchenbill> how can I stop the default action of a clicK?
[18:40:29] <wkmanire> luchenbill: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[18:43:47] <njbair> wkmanire: I haven't used jsfiddle much but I don't see jquery-ui on there.
[18:44:24] <wkmanire> it used to be available as a checkbox
[18:44:27] <wkmanire> now I think you have to use the CDN
[18:44:30] <wkmanire> I'll set up the fiddle for ya
[18:44:50] <njbair> thanks
[18:46:36] <wkmanire> njbair: http://jsfiddle.net/8guc2/
[18:47:04] <wkmanire> you can work out of that one, it has jQuery 1.6 and jQuery UI 1.8.10
[18:50:09] <njbair> working on it now thanks
[18:54:30] <Finity> hey guys, I have a question, I'm trying use jquery.ajax, but it seems like if I use type: "POST"
[18:54:36] <Finity> it does nothing
[18:55:11] <wkmanire> Finity: Make sure your server is set up to handle a POST on that resource.
[18:57:47] <luchenbill> thanks wkmanire
[18:57:48] <DobreJoe> hi, i'm trying to find the filename for an image, so far I have the src attribute from the image. Is there a way to only get the filename.jpg or filename part? At this point i'm using: var title = $("a.menu img").attr("src");
[18:57:54] <wkmanire> luchenbill: Welcome.
[18:58:13] <Finity> wkmanire: yeah, I'm using django, and I'm handeling the post request, but even super simple code like "if request.method == "POST": return HttpResponse('WORK!')" never gets executed
[18:58:33] <Finity> wkmanire: I've even tried to just return 'WORK!' without any condition, and it still never gets called
[18:58:52] <wkmanire> Finity: Put a callback handler in for each possible callback of ajax, then set a breakpoint inside of each one and see where you are getting.
[18:59:11] <njbair> wkmanire: apparently you can't really test ajax in jsfiddle unless you are posting data
[18:59:26] <redeeman> could i do something like this: $('#blabalb').rel.parseJSON() ?
[18:59:39] <redeeman> no sorry, $('#blabla').attr('rel').parseJSON()
[19:00:11] <wkmanire> DobreJoe: var segs = "path/to/resource.png".split("/"); filename = segs[segs.length-1];
[19:00:18] <wkmanire> DobreJoe: You can also use a regex with a capture.
[19:01:15] <DobreJoe> wkmanire: tnx, will try that.
[19:01:17] <wkmanire> njbair: Just mock the ajax part. Something like var = updateTab() { return /* your normal ajax response */};
[19:02:01] <wkmanire> updateTab = function (), bleh. Sorry for the crappy syntax
[19:02:26] <njbair> with .tabs() you don't actually write any AJAX
[19:02:43] <wkmanire> but you're wanting to do an ajax call to retrieve the content of the tab right?
[19:02:45] <njbair> it just converts a ul full of anchors to a row of tabs
[19:02:59] <njbair> and when you click the tab it loads its href via ajax
[19:03:32] <wkmanire> ahh, I see. I haven't used that pattern before. Theres probably a way to have it reload the tab then. Lemme take a look at the docs
[19:03:45] <njbair> wkmanire: it's .tabs('load')
[19:03:57] <njbair> but I can't figure out what element to apply it to
[19:04:38] <ch3mical> njbair: should be the containing div
[19:05:05] <wkmanire> But in ajax mode you don't provide the div, it is generated by the widget.
[19:05:31] <njbair> ch3mical: the div around the ul?
[19:05:39] <ch3mical> But it should return the object when it's created, right? You can also access tabs by index
[19:05:43] <ch3mical> If all else fails
[19:06:58] <njbair> haha when I look up ".tabs('load')" in google I get guitar music for the metallica album
[19:07:23] <ch3mical> njbair: The div the contains the tab, but like wkmanire said, if it's dynamically generated, that makes it more difficult, of course.
[19:07:30] <ch3mical> njbair: this is what you're doing, right? : http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#event-load
[19:08:26] <Whirl3d> good evening all. I am getting an error in firebug that says: a.owner Document is not defined in jquery 1.6.1....any ideas why?
[19:08:30] <Finity> wkmanire: ah, seems I'm getting a 403 response, that explains things ^_^
[19:08:39] <njbair> ch3mical: that's it
[19:08:43] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: yo yo yo
[19:08:54] <Whirl3d> Hey ch3mical, wassup?
[19:08:57] <njbair> ch3mical: wait no
[19:09:11] <njbair> ch3mical: the load *method* not the event
[19:09:11] <ch3mical> njbair: or method-load? http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-load
[19:09:23] <wkmanire> Finity: Yeah. Debugging ajax is usually straight forward. Just have to verify at every step that you are getting expected status codes and that the communication is actually taking place.
[19:09:44] <njbair> the page loads fine
[19:10:03] <njbair> but right now if I want to reload the current tab I have to click another tab and then back to the first one
[19:10:11] <njbair> I want to make a button that just reloads the current tab
[19:10:28] <ch3mical> njbair: I believe you just use the main tab div as the selector.. you should have like <div id="tabMain"><..the tab list><div id="tab1">..... and so on... (or maybe no tab1 even, if they're all dynamic
[19:10:53] <ch3mical> so do $('#tabMain').tabs('load',0);
[19:10:58] <Finity> wkmanire: yeah, figured it out, finally, django requires a certain post object for csrf protection, which I wasn't including
[19:11:08] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: Not much
[19:11:16] <njbair> yeah it's just <div id="tabs"><ul><li><a>....</a></li></ul></div>
[19:11:43] <ch3mical> so do $('#tabs').tabs('load',index);
[19:11:43] <wkmanire> Finity: I haven't used Django yet, but it is on my list. What is csrf protection?
[19:11:48] <ch3mical> That should work
[19:12:02] <njbair> hmm how to get the index then...
[19:12:15] <ch3mical> They are the order they appear in the ul
[19:12:23] <ch3mical> zero-based, so tab1 is index 0
[19:12:28] <Finity> wkmanire: I'm fairly unfamiliar with it myself, but: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/csrf/#ajax
[19:12:36] <njbair> ch3mical: I want one button that always reloads the current tab
[19:12:41] <Finity> would definitely explain it better than I could :)
[19:12:54] <ch3mical> njbair: is the button *in* the tab?
[19:12:59] <njbair> no
[19:13:07] <Whirl3d> Okay, better yet...how do I access the "complete" property of an image Element through jquery
[19:13:13] <njbair> it has to dynamically retrieve the current tab's index
[19:13:45] <wkmanire> Finity: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery
[19:13:53] <ch3mical> njbair: find the current tab like this: var selected = $( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "selected" );
[19:14:05] <ch3mical> Then use that to reload it
[19:14:21] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/eSB8C/3/ i'm trying to make a dynamic container loader, and i'm kind of failing with my logic here... All I want to do is if the link is clicked, I need to set a variable to the "new active" and set "currentActive" to the plain class
[19:14:35] <Whirl3d> nvm, got it
[19:14:46] <njbair> ch3mical: genius! i'm trying it now
[19:14:54] <ch3mical> njbair: so you could do var selected = $( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "selected" ); $('#tabs').tabs('load',selected);
[19:15:55] <abs|zer0|> Hi, I have a very quick question :  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/392988/
[19:16:02] <abs|zer0|> please help :)
[19:16:25] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: did you still need help?
[19:17:14] <ch3mical> njbair: FYI: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#option-selected
[19:17:32] <wkmanire> abs|zer0|: $(this)
[19:17:53] <abs|zer0|> wkmanire, thanks man, what's the difference between $(this) and
[19:17:55] <abs|zer0|> this?
[19:18:12] <wkmanire> abs|zer0|: this is the actual element. $(this) is the element in a jquery selector
[19:18:27] <abs|zer0|> wkmanire, so nice!!!
[19:18:29] <ch3mical> abs|zer0|:  this is the current object scope, wrapping it in $() turns it into a jquery selector
[19:18:30] <abs|zer0|> thanks man
[19:18:40] <ch3mical> wkmanire: shush! :P
[19:18:47] <abs|zer0|> thanks wkmanire ch3mical
[19:18:52] <wkmanire> ch3mical: What?
[19:19:02] <ch3mical> wkmanire: except that "this" isn't always an element ;)
[19:19:11] <wkmanire> "this" can be very unpredictable
[19:19:48] <ch3mical> It's actually very predictable if you understand how it differs in different situations.. functions, callbacks, loops, etc
[19:19:59] * wkmanire sighs
[19:20:37] <ch3mical> Fine, you clearly would prefer to believe what you believe, heh
[19:20:38] <njbair> ch3mical: works great. Thanks
[19:20:44] <ch3mical> njbair: sweet!
[19:20:45] <wkmanire> ch3mical: Thats true as long as you do a global search for .apply and .call
[19:21:03] <wkmanire> Don't forget about underscores bind function
[19:21:09] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/eSB8C/3/ i'm trying to make a dynamic container loader, and i'm kind of failing with my logic here... All I want to do is if the link is clicked, I need to set a variable to the "new active" and set "currentActive" to the plain class
[19:21:18] <wkmanire> We can get as arbitrarily complex as you like
[19:21:18] <wkmanire> he he
[19:21:33] <ch3mical> I love complexity ;p
[19:22:48] <ch3mical> luchenbill: rather than asking us to do your work for you, did you have a specific problem we can help with? All you have there is a handfull of vars
[19:23:12] <ch3mical> luchenbill: you should start by reading http://api.jquery.com/
[19:23:29] <wkmanire> ch3mical: http://wkmanire.com/projects/doitforme/
[19:23:33] <wkmanire> he he he he
[19:23:35] <luchenbill> ch3mical obviously i'm not asking you to do my work, I am however asking for some logic help
[19:23:54] <DanAKAHollywood> I have been googling for a few days and haven't found a logical plugin or any information from what I'm working on. I'm looking to implement a WYSIWYG editor like that in Google Docs. I am looking for a plugin or something of the sort that can capture all keyboard input on the window and stuff it into divs.
[19:24:40] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: Have you checked out the aloha project? aloha-editor.org
[19:24:41] <DanAKAHollywood> I'm having problems capturing key combinations and all of the plugins I find are more suited towards ctrl+key sequences and are pretty dirty when it comes to handing things like... capital letters.
[19:24:54] <wkmanire> they might have the problem solved for you already.
[19:24:58] <luchenbill> smart ass cunts
[19:25:25] <wkmanire> luchenbill: Wow dude. You'll get no help from any of us with an attitude like that.
[19:25:37] <wkmanire> atitude*
[19:25:57] <luchenbill> wkmanire: wow dude, you were helping out so much thanks! :D
[19:25:58] <mykul> DanAKAHollywood, aloha is a massive in-line editor built around an inconsistent contenteditble implementation
[19:26:40] <mykul> it gets the job done, but it's a nightmare to dive into if you want to customie it at all
[19:27:06] <DanAKAHollywood> I really don't want to use a pre-existing editor for this, I want to build it from the ground up for this project, existing editors don't seem to provide the flexibility I need on this project.
[19:27:36] <mykul> are you trying to edit the DOM in-line, or process a text area
[19:27:57] <DanAKAHollywood> mykul: Cloud-based word processor, like Google Docs, but different in nature.
[19:28:04] <ch3mical> wkmanire: very neat tool!
[19:28:07] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: Thats understandeable. As for as doing the keyboard inputs. I saw an events plugin on microjs the other day that had a neat syntax for key combinations.
[19:28:26] <wkmanire> wkmanire: :) thanks
[19:28:34] <mykul> whoa
[19:29:03] <DanAKAHollywood> mykul: I have a lot of it ready to go, just implementing the key input is requiring a lot of legwork for one guy
[19:29:12] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: https://github.com/kbjr/Events.js   "Events.bind(document, 'keystroke.Ctrl+A', function(e) {"
[19:30:02] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Thanks, that looks a little more promising.
[19:30:11] <mykul> DanAKAHollywood i hear you.  implementing your own online editor is certainly nontrivial
[19:30:12] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: Although you probably need something more industrial
[19:30:16] <wkmanire> this could give you a start
[19:30:24] <mykul> wish i could help
[19:31:08] <mykul> a co-worker and I are rolling our own lighter-weight in-line editor after struggling with aloha
[19:31:23] <mykul> we're planning to get it on github soon
[19:31:31] <wkmanire> mykul: That was my next question.
[19:31:33] <ch3mical> luchenbill: care to start over? Would you please give us a specific problem you are bumping into trying to accomplish your goal? I'm willing to help, if you have some specific problem or a more specific question.
[19:32:11] <DanAKAHollywood> mykul: I will publish to github after I get a little further along. The problem I have is that the site is going to be an open-source initiative, but I'm launching a corporation to back it.
[19:32:30] <ch3mical> luchenbill: fact is, all you said is you want to set some vars and showed us some code that just has some vars in it... that doesn't tell us much, or give us much to go on
[19:32:34] <wkmanire> mykul: I'll be needing an editor soon and if yours is available I'll definitely give it it a look when considering different options.
[19:32:50] <mykul> wkmanire, right on, i can let you know when it's up
[19:32:58] <wkmanire> I'm in here all the time. :)
[19:33:06] <mykul> cool
[19:33:13] <ch3mical> DanAKAHollywood: I came in in the middle of that, but now you've said "OSI"... you're speaking my language.. what is your project?
[19:33:30] <abs|zer0|> :( another simple question guy
[19:33:33] <abs|zer0|> srry
[19:33:34] <abs|zer0|> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/392993/
[19:34:39] <wkmanire> abs|zer0|: That variable won't be available on line 4 for two reasons
[19:34:52] <abs|zer0|> yeah
[19:35:03] <abs|zer0|> what are they? :)
[19:35:06] <wkmanire> The first is that it is being declared automatically inside of that function which is in a different scope
[19:35:16] <wkmanire> The second is that XHR requests are handled asynchronously by default.
[19:35:22] <DanAKAHollywood> ch3mical: It is a site that allows users to write documents, and books and the likes (or upload Pages, Word, ODF documents) and publish them independently. Once you publish them to the online market, eBook formats are generated and such. It is like the YouTube for authors.
[19:35:26] <wkmanire> Which means that line 4 executes before the XHR request comes back.
[19:35:27] <abs|zer0|> oh
[19:35:29] <abs|zer0|> I see
[19:35:30] <abs|zer0|> ...
[19:35:33] <ch3mical> Hurray for race conditions
[19:35:48] <abs|zer0|> man , im not really used to event-driven programming :-s
[19:35:56] <ch3mical> DanAKAHollywood: nice, I have a friend who is a writer
[19:35:59] <wkmanire> abs|zer0|: It gets easier with time.
[19:36:06] <mykul> abs|zer0|, once you get it it's amazing
[19:36:07] <dxgriffiths> wkmanire: He's not using var... so it would actually be correct if the call was made in sync mode.
[19:36:19] <mykul> especially when you start leveraging deferred objects
[19:36:19] <ch3mical> DanAKAHollywood: a couple, actually
[19:36:24] <wkmanire> dxgriffiths: Yeah, I thought of that after I sent my message out
[19:36:36] <wkmanire> abs|zer0|: Did you get what dxgriffiths said?
[19:36:40] <dxgriffiths> wkmanire: no worries.
[19:36:41] <abs|zer0|> so I have to put every statement needs that var inside that anonymous function?
[19:36:50] <DanAKAHollywood> ch3mical: I have a document that explains the vision if you would like to have a look.
[19:36:51] <ch3mical> sync mode... ewwwww
[19:37:00] <ch3mical> DanAKAHollywood: yeah, definitely
[19:37:10] <abs|zer0|> wkmanire, yeah I even tried putting var my_tags in global scope , but it didnt work
[19:37:18] <DanAKAHollywood> ch3mical: Can you open a Pages doc?
[19:37:19] <abs|zer0|> yeah so that race condition is the reason
[19:37:38] <wkmanire> abs|zer0|: No you just have to think of your procedure as a series of events.
[19:37:57] <wkmanire> Set up several functions to deal with the problem and pass your data betweent hem
[19:37:59] <wkmanire> them*
[19:38:00] <ch3mical> DanAKAHollywood: that's apple something-or-other?
[19:38:08] <abs|zer0|> oh I see
[19:38:08] <abs|zer0|> :)
[19:38:15] <ch3mical> DanAKAHollywood: oddly enough, I'm on a macbook right now, but it runs linux lol
[19:38:17] <abs|zer0|> so create a separate function
[19:38:23] <DanAKAHollywood> ch3mical: Yea, Apple document, I will convert and upload it.
[19:38:27] <abs|zer0|> then call it inside the anonymous function
[19:38:42] <ch3mical> DanAKAHollywood: cool thanks :)
[19:39:09] <ch3mical> abs|zer0|: exactly, now you're getting it :)
[19:39:14] <abs|zer0|> :P
[19:39:17] <abs|zer0|> thanks lol
[19:39:22] <ch3mical> heh
[19:39:33] <wkmanire> var first = function () { var a = 1;  second(a);}; var second = function (a) { var b = 2 + a; three(b);}; var three = function(c) { alert(c)}; first();
[19:39:39] * wkmanire shakes is head.
[19:39:44] <wkmanire> that was a horrible example
[19:39:48] <abs|zer0|> yeah nodejs has the same mechanism
[19:39:57] <abs|zer0|> understanding this is helpful :)
[19:40:09] <wkmanire> abs|zer0|: You're using node? Awesome :)
[19:40:09] <abs|zer0|> wkmanire, i see your point man
[19:40:10] <abs|zer0|> thanks
[19:40:21] <abs|zer0|> wkmanire, no im about to learn it
[19:40:28] <abs|zer0|> actually I was about to learn Twisted
[19:40:35] <abs|zer0|> since I'm kinda good at python
[19:40:43] <abs|zer0|> yeah but nodejs seems to be better
[19:40:45] <abs|zer0|> :)
[19:40:54] <wkmanire> I played with it a little. Nodejs is fun.
[19:41:21] <abs|zer0|> yeah but I need to learn more/understand event-driven programming first :)
[19:41:22] <abs|zer0|> it's fun though
[19:41:28] <abs|zer0|> thanks guys wkmanire ch3mical
[19:41:37] <wkmanire> no prob.
[19:42:24] <DanAKAHollywood> ch3mical: Check your PM
[19:44:52] <ch3mical> k
[19:45:26] <notbrent> what's the best js book for someone who already knows a fair bit about programming?
[19:45:42] <dxgriffiths> I really liked JavaScript Patterns.
[19:46:19] <Ratty> Hi, I have an issue with my jquery... I have content that is tabbed and I use a pagination plugin for long content. Whenever I click on things continuously the pagination plugin breaks whenever you click on page 2 or page 3 of about. Here is a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qkRjG/2/embedded/result/
[19:46:24] <Ratty> Do any of you have any ideas what is causing this?
[19:46:33] <notbrent> looks nice
[19:46:38] <dxgriffiths> notbrent: The one by Stoyan Stefanov.
[19:46:44] <notbrent> right
[19:46:48] <notbrent> looks short and to the point
[19:47:02] <notbrent> thanks
[19:47:05] <dxgriffiths> It has a lot of nitty gritty details about var and function hoisting that make understanding JS a lot easier.
[19:47:38] <ch3mical1> dxgriffiths: what are you referring to/
[19:47:39] <ch3mical1> ?
[19:47:46] <notbrent> excellent
[19:47:54] <notbrent> and it's available at the local library
[19:47:59] <notbrent> ;)
[19:48:03] <dxgriffiths> ch3mical1: notbrent was asking about a book.
[19:48:10] <ch3mical1> dxgriffiths: ah
[19:48:16] <ch3mical1> I can't learn from books
[19:48:40] <ch3mical1> I learn so much better by doing and reading documentation
[19:48:43] <ch3mical1> That's just me
[19:49:13] <ch3mical1> I was hoping you were talking about a website, though
[19:49:36] <dxgriffiths> ch3mical: There's a link about var hoisting if you want it, just a sec.
[19:50:17] <Whirl3d> hi again. Anybody know why I keep getting the error (Node cannot be insert at this point in the heirarchy?) during an ajax call?
[19:50:23] <coldhead> i learn best by havinga beautiful woman with a thick accent read to me robotically
[19:50:23] <dxgriffiths> ch3mical: http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting
[19:51:18] <ch3mical> coldhead: ooo, I've got to try that ;)
[19:51:25] <ch3mical> dxgriffiths: thanks
[19:51:26] <dxgriffiths> ch3mical: there's also #jsmentors, I hang out in there answering questions also.
[19:52:56] <ch3mical> ;p
[19:54:10] <Whirl3d> Nobody knows what it"unable to insert node at his point in heirarchy" means?
[19:54:19] <Whirl3d> *this
[19:54:47] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: not without some context
[19:57:02] <Whirl3d> simple ajax call, success handler fires and I use success:function (data) { $("#node").html($(data))   or .html(data) or html($(data).find(".something"))   and I get the same error all the time
[19:57:32] <Whirl3d> .append (data) or .append($(data)) etc. doesn't work either
[19:57:41] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: data = what?
[19:58:03] <ch3mical> Have you logged it to the console to make sure it contains the values you are expecting?
[19:58:08] <Whirl3d> The first argument passed in the ajax success callback   {sucess:function(data) {...
[19:58:24] <ch3mical> lol :P not what I meant
[19:58:26] <Whirl3d> yup, shows the html page contents
[19:58:36] <ch3mical> So it's just straight html
[19:58:38] <Whirl3d> simple menu, nothing special. Loads fine using load
[19:59:01] <Whirl3d> but then my timing gets messed up because it tries to configure the menu before it's loaded
[19:59:21] <Whirl3d> so, with Ajax, I figured I could at least ensure that the menu was loaded before configuring it.
[19:59:44] <ch3mical> Depends on if you're doing the config in the AJAX callback
[19:59:54] <ch3mical> Or in a function referenced by the callback
[20:00:16] <Whirl3d> in a function referenced by the callback
[20:00:24] <Whirl3d> but I can't even get that far
[20:00:41] <Whirl3d> i get the success callback and the data is there, but I can't add it to the dom
[20:01:12] <ch3mical> ok, I see
[20:01:20] <Whirl3d> Ideally, I would like to sort through the data before attaching it and only attach pieces of it. But that's asking too much if I can't attach any of it.
[20:01:21] <Whirl3d> lol
[20:01:21] * ch3mical ponders
[20:01:43] <ch3mical> What are you attaching it to?
[20:01:49] <ch3mical> Or trying to
[20:02:15] <Whirl3d> anything. A div that was pre-made. or a div that I create on the fly and add to the body in the success callback.
[20:02:35] <ch3mical> ok
[20:03:01] <Whirl3d> I'm gonna try using 1.5. If it works, I'm giving up on 1.6.   I spent 3 days trying to figure out a problem with the opacity issue and tada it was fixed. UGGH
[20:03:21] <ch3mical> What datatype are you setting in the AJAX call?
[20:04:37] <progrock> with css3 fonts, how do I make sure the font is fully loaded beforea script is executed?
[20:05:56] <Whirl3d> none. Doesn't work in 1.5 either. I give up. Too much hassle. I'll just use .live to manage my menu config and lump it.
[20:06:28] <ch3mical> I'm positive we can make it work, but don't stress yourself out over it
[20:07:06] <snowBlind_> Would using .load() to load content from one file into the current HTML page be considered AJAX if there is no specific AJAX request made?
[20:07:19] <tbranyen> snowBlind_: load uses ajax
[20:07:20] <tbranyen> so yes
[20:07:29] <snowBlind_> Ok, cool. I did no know that.
[20:07:38] <snowBlind_> not*
[20:08:56] <ch3mical> And now you know.
[20:09:08] <ch3mical> *sage*
[20:10:25] <snowBlind_> Indeed!
[20:21:36] <ch3mical> It's quiet...
[20:21:43] <ch3mical> A little *too* quiet...
[20:22:51] <ch3mical> <__<
[20:22:54] <ch3mical> >__>
[20:23:01] <ch3mical> *tumbleweed*
[20:23:21] <thathurts> you can help my optimize my application if you want
[20:23:27] <ch3mical> ack!!
[20:23:34] <ch3mical> Sorry, you startled me
[20:23:57] <ch3mical> thathurts: what's in it for me?
[20:37:21] <tmayr> ;o
[20:38:12] <Ratty> Hi, I have an issue with my jquery... I have content that is tabbed and I use a pagination plugin for long content. Whenever I click on things continuously the pagination plugin breaks whenever you click on page 2 or page 3 of about. Here is a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qkRjG/2/embedded/result/
[20:38:20] <Ratty> Do any of you have any ideas what is causing this?
[20:41:38] <ch3mical> Ratty: you're going to have to fix your example first, there's nothing even loading
[20:42:32] <TNorris> ch3mical: might want to check again. working for me.
[20:42:44] <Ratty> It should be working
[20:42:57] <tmayr> working fine here
[20:43:06] <ch3mical> wtf
[20:43:15] <ch3mical> I'm using Chrome
[20:43:18] <tmayr> well, the example loads*, the issue you're having its clearly there :p
[20:43:26] <tmayr> using Chrome too here
[20:43:26] <Whirl3d> Ok, I am about to scream. Firefox 4 sux so bad, I can't believe it. Isn't there some way to override the SOP if you are doing local testing using a server on the same computer?
[20:43:37] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: No
[20:43:38] <Ratty> I get to page 3 and it displays: array_of_elements[page] is undefined as an error
[20:43:54] <TNorris> Ratty: what browser you testing in?
[20:43:56] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: or proxy it through php or something
[20:44:06] <Whirl3d> That is unbelievable. I am so shocked that I am thinking about quitting this project and never touching another computer again.;
[20:44:17] <Ratty> TNorris, Firefox 4
[20:44:30] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: whoa, don't do anything drastic
[20:44:32] <tmayr> Whirl3d: calm down haha
[20:45:35] <DanAKAHollywood> Ratty: It works for me
[20:45:37] <Ratty> Yeah on google chrome it gives that error right off the bat
[20:45:59] <DanAKAHollywood> Ratty: No problems with Chrome here
[20:46:04] <Ratty> DanAKAHollywood, Try clicking on "Constitution", then "About, and finally clicking on page 3
[20:46:14] <Ratty> under the pagination
[20:46:25] <Ratty> It pops up with that error
[20:46:34] <TNorris> thanks. just about to ask how to reproduce that error.
[20:46:57] <Whirl3d> in firefox, I have it load an image at a given location. No Problems. Except it's a really old version of the image. So, I refresh the cache, no help. So I rename the image and sure enough FF can't find it. So I take a completley different image, name it the same thing and refresh my cache and it loads with no problems. So I am SURE that I have the right image and location.
[20:47:01] <Ratty> Yeah, I don't know what the deal was with that
[20:47:02] <DanAKAHollywood> Ratty: It didn't popup an error but it doesn't load any content.
[20:47:15] <Ratty> DanAKAHollywood, Yeah that is the issue right there
[20:47:31] <Ratty> It pops up an error in the javascript console about this error
[20:48:00] <TNorris> DanAKAHollywood: check your console. it's giving me an "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'show' of undefined"
[20:48:45] <DanAKAHollywood> Loading the page fails in FF 4, Firebug caught an error right off the bat
[20:49:02] <Ratty> Yeah I am wondering if it is a plugin issue or something in my original code to call the program
[20:49:16] <wkmanire> Holy crap! My son's Elmo birthday balloon just totally snuck up on me and scared the crap out of me.
[20:49:27] <ch3mical> Ratty: sounds like you're just running out of objects in an array, though I haven't looked, since it didn't load for me
[20:49:28] <Ratty> wkmanire, lol
[20:49:29] <wkmanire> but thats ok. I judo chopped the hell out of it.
[20:49:42] <TNorris> Ratty: I'm having the same issue in Chrome as well.
[20:49:54] <ch3mical> wkmanire: that ought to teach it
[20:49:58] <wkmanire> :D
[20:49:58] <DanAKAHollywood> Ratty: According to Firebug it is in jpagination line 73: array_of_elements[page].show();
[20:50:09] <Ratty> TNorris, Yeah I just saw that.
[20:50:28] <Ratty> DanAKAHollywood, Yeah I know... Grrrr
[20:50:45] <ch3mical> Ratty: so again, it sounds like you might be telling jPaginate to load something that doesn't exist?
[20:51:16] <Ratty> Hmmm...
[20:51:45] <DanAKAHollywood> Ratty: It's in your constitution page somewhere
[20:52:03] <Ratty> So it boils down to my original javascript code then
[20:53:21] <DanAKAHollywood> Ratty, I'm digging through your source, let me check
[20:53:27] <Ratty> Could it be that I am running jpaginate in a loop and it is given faulty data
[20:54:09] <ch3mical> Stack trace it
[20:54:49] <ch3mical> When shaking a stick at it fails... stack trace it ;p
[20:55:35] <Ratty> ;p
[20:57:53] <letterpress> any suggestions on how to create a js object from a google map kml file?
[20:58:18] <DanAKAHollywood> Okay so it happens on every page. I hate running debuggers on pages.
[20:58:42] <ch3mical> Stupid Aptana
[20:59:00] <DanAKAHollywood> ch3mical: I like Aptana, although 3 is buggy as hell.
[20:59:01] <ch3mical> Hey, speaking of... what is everyone's favorite IDE?
[20:59:15] <DanAKAHollywood> Ratty: It isn't anything you are doing, it is the plugin
[20:59:31] <Ratty> ch3mical, just use vim
[20:59:52] <tmayr> using espresso here :p
[20:59:54] <ch3mical> I prefer emacs to vim
[21:00:08] <Ratty> just out of curiosity, why?
[21:00:20] <ch3mical> It's more powerful
[21:00:54] <wkmanire> ch3mical: I'm an emacs user too. Lets gang up on them.
[21:01:06] <DanAKAHollywood> Sadly I have never learned emacs
[21:01:08] <ch3mical> vim is just vim, emacs can do anything.. I can use it as a friggin irc client if it suits my fancy
[21:01:11] <ch3mical> wkmanire: woot
[21:01:18] <coldhead> fuck yes, lisp powered text environment
[21:01:26] <coldhead> i am connected to IRC via emacs
[21:01:27] <ch3mical> coldhead: high five
[21:01:28] <wkmanire> erc ftw
[21:01:37] <coldhead> fear my wrath
[21:01:41] <ch3mical> heh
[21:01:42] <Ratty> emacs, more powerful, really?
[21:01:54] <ch3mical> durr
[21:02:03] <coldhead> its extensible!
[21:02:08] <Ratty> no comment
[21:02:08] <Ratty> lol
[21:02:10] <coldhead> extensible like a turing machine
[21:02:11] <ch3mical> double durr
[21:02:19] <Ratty> yeah irc in emacs
[21:02:20] <Ratty> lol
[21:02:41] <gkatsev> ch3mical: there is vimirc, if you are so inclined
[21:02:56] <ch3mical> *yak*
[21:02:58] <wkmanire> Ratty: It doesn't matter really. Just use the thing you are fastest with.
[21:02:59] <gkatsev> emacs is a nice OS. If only it had a good editor. :)
[21:03:09] <ch3mical> gkatsev: hehehe
[21:03:13] <wkmanire> gkatsev: ha ha ha nice.
[21:03:18] <Ratty> wkmanire, Yeah I know. Hehe... ;)
[21:03:43] <wkmanire> I like js2 mode for emacs. But I have to huge complaints about it.
[21:03:51] <DanAKAHollywood> Ratty: The first time I goes through the loop to populate array_of_elements, it stuffs a null value into it.
[21:03:52] <wkmanire> 1 is that it is inconsistent with tabs vs spaces
[21:03:57] * gkatsev is a vim guy
[21:04:09] <wkmanire> 2 is that it doesn't like jQuery style formatting.
[21:04:10] <coldhead> emacs has 3 vi emulators built in, so don't give me that "decent editor" crap
[21:04:14] <coldhead> i'd like to see vi do that
[21:04:27] <ch3mical> coldhead: vi emulate vi?
[21:04:28] <Ratty> DanAKAHollywood, You mind if I pm you?
[21:04:33] <ch3mical> coldhead: that's so meta
[21:04:34] <DanAKAHollywood> Go ahead
[21:04:40] <gkatsev> coldhead: exactly, it needs to emulate vim to get anywhere remotely good.
[21:04:41] <gkatsev> :P
[21:04:48] <coldhead> embedded vi in vi would be awesome
[21:05:06] <ch3mical> But..... what about emacs in emacs? O_O
[21:05:32] <wkmanire> gkatsev: I remember the first time I popped open vi. I remember thinking to myself, why don't any of my keypresses put text into the buffer?
[21:05:36] <coldhead> the only good reason to dislike emacs is if you don't like lisp and if you don't like lisp you are dead to me
[21:05:48] <ch3mical> lol
[21:05:48] <gkatsev> you can install the conque plugin for vim, which alloows you to run processes such as shells inside of vim. So, you could run a shell and open vim inside of vim.
[21:06:18] <ch3mical> gkatsev: that doesn't count
[21:06:39] <gkatsev> lol
[21:07:27] <ch3mical> coldhead: write us a jQuery parser for emacs, kthx
[21:07:39] <coldhead> js2-mode is almost that
[21:07:51] <coldhead> it makes me very tired to read the source though
[21:07:51] <ch3mical> Almost isn't good enough
[21:07:53] <ch3mical> :/
[21:07:56] <coldhead> i think i might have a disease
[21:08:05] <ch3mical> Lazyiness?
[21:08:26] <wkmanire> coldhead: But the mixed match tabs and spaces and inability to put )}; together make it hard to work with others.
[21:08:27] <coldhead> yes, well diagnosed House
[21:08:58] <coldhead> you can customise that sstuff, wkmanire
[21:09:00] <wkmanire> My co-workers are always nagging at me for messing up their pretty formatting. Their text editors don't reformat source as they open it.
[21:09:01] <coldhead> probably
[21:09:03] <coldhead> somehow
[21:09:18] <wkmanire> coldhead: Sure you can. If you want to debug a big pile of lisp.
[21:09:27] <wkmanire> But the conf-mode for js2-mode doesn't address these issues.
[21:09:28] <coldhead> who doesn;'t!
[21:09:28] <wkmanire> i've looked.
[21:09:29] <ch3mical> mmm pile of lisp
[21:09:44] <coldhead> yeah i don't actually use js2 mode
[21:09:48] <coldhead> i just pretend to
[21:09:55] <wkmanire> What do you use?
[21:09:56] <coldhead> i like Fundamental mode
[21:10:04] <coldhead> wysiwyg
[21:10:47] * wkmanire facepalms.
[21:11:12] <ch3mical> kekeke
[21:11:26] <wkmanire> ch3mical: You're not Brazilian are you?
[21:11:33] <coldhead> i mostly use the coffeescript mode for my js needs actually
[21:11:38] * ch3mical checks...
[21:11:41] <ch3mical> No?
[21:11:47] <wkmanire> I haven't tried that mode yet coldhead.
[21:11:57] <wkmanire> ch3mical: Ah ok, brazillians LOL like this "kkkkkkk"
[21:12:00] <wkmanire> or "rsrsrsrs"
[21:12:07] <ch3mical> lolwtf
[21:12:22] <wkmanire> and sometimes uahuahuahuahuah
[21:12:31] <ch3mical> "keke" is more of a Japanese thing
[21:12:36] <ch3mical> I've seen uhauhahauhauha
[21:12:55] <ch3mical> I thought that guy was just retarded though
[21:15:33] <coldhead> thai people indicate boredom with -*-
[21:15:39] <coldhead> not sure how that works
[21:18:04] <ch3mical> Uhh, CLEARLY that's their mind imploding from severe lack of positive stimluation, combined with an apathetic disposition... obviously you don't know your emoji
[21:18:18] <ch3mical> ;p
[21:21:13] <coldhead> oh thx ch3mical
[21:21:43] <wkmanire> kkkkk
[21:22:05] <TNorris> anyone have a quick way of correcting for the IEEE precision error?
[21:22:05] <ch3mical> rofl
[21:22:07] <TNorris> using toFixed() is taking ~12x's as long.
[21:22:23] * ch3mical sneaks away...
[21:23:25] <wkmanire> TNorris: multiply
[21:24:42] <TNorris> wkmanire: how's that? (using 0.3 - 0.4 as an example)
[21:24:49] <coldhead> don't use JS >: \
[21:25:08] <wkmanire> You're basically multiplying the problem away.
[21:25:33] <wkmanire> ((0.3 * 10000) - (.4 * 10000))
[21:25:38] <wkmanire> then you can string manip a point into place.
[21:25:59] <wkmanire> its crude but it works unless you`re engineering a bridge
[21:26:22] <coldhead> protip don't engineer bridges in JS
[21:28:08] <TNorris> wkmanire: nice. thinking that way, if you use n * 1e15, then that should correct for any possible value.
[21:28:10] <TNorris> since js doesn't have higher precision than that.
[21:28:36] <wkmanire> What are you doing? Plotting a hyperspace course?
[21:29:12] <TNorris> wkmanire: high precision statistics.
[21:29:36] <wkmanire> You should use fortran then
[21:29:46] <wkmanire> Or MatLab
[21:30:48] <ch3mical> fortran ftw
[21:32:15] <TNorris> might be somewhat of trying to force a square peg in a round hole, but it's meant to be like a simplistic R
[21:32:18] <TNorris> for web use.
[21:32:35] <TNorris> and just trying to get the most out of it.
[21:33:25] <djQuery> ?bignumber.js
[21:33:28] <ch3mical> Not sure why you would do that clientside, but I'm just going to leave that one alone
[21:34:34] <djQuery> http://jsfromhell.com/classes/bignumber
[21:34:41] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[21:34:42] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 11 hours, 16 minutes and 54 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 264 seconds
[21:34:58] <djQuery> bot-t is getting realy lazy lately
[21:35:03] <ch3mical> That bot is such a slacker
[21:35:08] <wkmanire> I'm going to get him fired pretty soon.
[21:35:10] <TNorris> just an adventure in what's possible.
[21:35:53] <TNorris> djQuery: thanks, haven't seen such a clean implementation of big number functions before.
[21:36:38] <djQuery> TNorris: needed it when I was doing a crosbrewser meter element
[21:37:19] <djQuery> need bigger keyboard for fat fingers
[21:49:38] <Fernandos> hi
[21:50:50] <ch3mical> http://peopleofpublictransit.com/spit-shine-yo-shoes/ lol
[21:51:06] <Fernandos> I'm currently getting a thanks lightbox every time I submit the form via ajax.. how can I hide that message when I get this response? {"error":"Enter a name please"}
[21:52:59] <coldhead> pastebin your coads, Fernandos
[21:54:31] <Fernandos> coldhead: http://chopapp.com/#cfpl3n9n
[21:54:52] <Ellement> can i pass a jq object in data array to event handler?
[21:55:06] <Ellement> im generating an error doing so
[21:55:12] <tbranyen> how so
[21:56:50] <Ellement> tbranyen: var $foo  = $('.foo'); $('.baz').click({foo : $foo}, bar)
[21:58:15] <Ellement> tbranyen: does that look right?
[21:58:16] <coldhead> Fernandos: if(data.error='') maybe needs to be == ?
[21:58:18] <innociv> http://pastebin.com/9wW9NQx5  How do I not have that table closing before the $.each()?
[21:58:33] <innociv> oh
[21:58:34] <innociv> nevermind
[21:58:42] <tbranyen> Ellement: not in my mind it doesn't
[21:58:50] <Fernandos> uh,, me fool xD
[21:58:59] <tbranyen> Ellement: i'm not sure what you're trying to make that do
[21:59:39] <Ellement> assign click event on baz, with callback bar passing in foo as data to bar
[22:00:28] <Ellement> wa an example of my problem
[22:02:28] <Fernandos> coldhead: shame on me.. thanks it worked perfectly :) I should have a list of stupid things not to do.. and put not to forget that equals means == not =
[22:04:36] <danniel> hi, how to append <li> at the end of <ul>?
[22:04:52] <ch3mical> Superglue?
[22:06:07] <danniel> i dont know
[22:06:15] <danniel> im newbie :)
[22:06:16] <djQuery> danniel: $('ul').append($('<li />
[22:06:50] <djQuery> danniel: jqfundamentals.com then
[22:07:51] <djQuery> $('ul').append($('<li />').append('hell world'));
[22:08:24] <danniel> i'll try...
[22:08:32] <coldhead> Fernandos: jshint should catch that for you
[22:08:44] <coldhead> its a good collection of stupid mistake catchers
[22:09:05] <djQuery> should rename it to youidiot
[22:09:26] <coldhead> Fernandos: also you can avoid that by swapping the operands so it says if ('' = varName)
[22:09:36] <coldhead> because that can never work
[22:10:34] <Fernandos> hrhrhr :D yeah
[22:11:51] <Fernandos> btw you should check this out if you haven't already http://bellard.org/jslinux/
[22:12:20] <DanAKAHollywood> Okay, I need some input. I have a div, let's say id="document" and I'm capturing input from the keyboard and want to echo it into the div. I have <span id="cursor">|</span> to emulate a caret. How can I have the input always echo just before #caret?
[22:13:22] <sunscreen> hm
[22:13:36] <coldhead> .before('#caret')
[22:13:51] <sunscreen> i have http://www.glassbox-js.com/#download
[22:14:01] <sunscreen> but it conflicts with the jquery core
[22:14:25] <coldhead> oh no :(
[22:14:27] <sunscreen> i dont know why if i just remove the <script > jquery glassbox works
[22:14:43] <tbranyen> sunscreen: don't use them in conjunction then
[22:14:45] <DanAKAHollywood> sunscreen: Wow, I had not stumbled across that, thank you. I have been going insane with the keystroke handling and gone complete retard.
[22:15:27] <sunscreen> but i have a popup that need jquery
[22:16:01] <djQuery> sunscreen: do a google for jquery noconflict
[22:16:10] <sunscreen> k
[22:16:56] <sunscreen> kk
[22:17:03] <sunscreen> seems easy enoughed
[22:18:05] <Fernandos> DanAKAHollywood: you can get that glass effect with this css snippet too, with a one liner you could get a glassbox clone too http://pastebin.com/4LbWZYkL
[22:18:22] <sunscreen> hmm
[22:18:26] <sunscreen> error changes to: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[22:19:02] <wkmanire> Here comes the jesters 1, 2, 3...
[22:19:11] <Fernandos> I know my sentences repeat after a while.. I've coded too much c then php and then javascript the last days.. switching kills
[22:19:19] * wkmanire rocks out
[22:21:00] <DanAKAHollywood> Fernandos: I know what you mean, all J2EE and C++ at work and then JS,CSS,PHP at home. It becomes a hassle
[22:21:21] <wkmanire> At least those are all semi-colon intensive.
[22:21:32] <Fernandos> yes.. it's c at school and the other crap at work
[22:21:56] <wkmanire> I'm forever typeing "Dim i as Integer;"
[22:21:57] <wkmanire> at work
[22:22:09] <coldhead> just a moment
[22:22:16] <Fernandos> not to forget java and c# which suck a lot more.. but that's just me.. most other people like java and c#
[22:22:44] <Fernandos> switching from java to c# and back is funy.. because it's too similar
[22:22:47] <DanAKAHollywood> Fernandos: Java is a quick language to get things done in, I think that is the appeal
[22:23:06] <Fernandos> some say it's the modern cobol..
[22:23:07] <DanAKAHollywood> Or so I thought until I started writing on a JBoss application
[22:23:09] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: Knock knock
[22:23:26] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Yes?
[22:23:40] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: You`re supposed to say "Who's there?"
[22:23:52] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: Knock knock...
[22:24:03] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Um, who's there?
[22:24:10] <wkmanire> long pause.......
[22:24:12] <wkmanire> .......
[22:24:13] <wkmanire> ...
[22:24:15] <wkmanire> JVM
[22:24:42] * wkmanire cackles to himself.
[22:24:46] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Good one.
[22:25:37] <DanAKAHollywood> kbjr is not going to cut it for this editor. It requires that I add a binding for every single key I want to listen for. That is way too much code and will just bloat this application
[22:25:55] <DanAKAHollywood> I cannot find a jQuery plugin to handle this.....
[22:28:01] <sunscreen> window.onload = function(){
[22:28:01] <sunscreen> jQuery.noConflict()(function(){
[22:28:01] <sunscreen> 	path_to_root_dir = "";
[22:28:01] <sunscreen> 	var myBox = new GlassBox();
[22:28:01] <sunscreen> 	myBox.init( 'myBox', '128px', '62px', 'hidden' );
[22:28:02] <sunscreen> 	myBox.apos( '170px', '150px' );
[22:28:03] <sunscreen> });
[22:28:05] <sunscreen> };
[22:28:42] <sunscreen> hmmz no luvings
[22:29:47] <DanAKAHollywood> sunscreen: Fernandos was trying to show you a work-around for that without having to use GlassBox but he sent it to me. http://pastebin.com/4LbWZYkL
[22:30:41] <sunscreen> you have me confused
[22:31:39] <DanAKAHollywood> sunscreen: you can get that glass effect with this css snippet too, with a one liner you could get a glassbox clone too http://pastebin.com/4LbWZYkL
[22:35:19] <sunscreen> aha
[22:35:33] <sunscreen> not bad for tiny bit bit of css
[22:35:37] <sunscreen> ;) heheh
[22:46:58] <khurram> hi everyone
[22:47:18] <wkmanire> khurram: Howdy
[22:48:20] <khurram> i am just wondaring the W3 has provided some level of security measure on the INPUT TYPE FILE , right and similarly
[22:49:11] <khurram> every is talking about XSS and other attacks on to their web sites from local computers NO one is talking about the attacks on a user computer from server
[22:49:23] <khurram> Which means W3 is missing some part here for the BOTS to work properly
[22:50:17] <khurram> other wise by just simply adding or introducing a bot crack field can 100% prevent spamming and no need for captchas
[22:52:21] <khurram> hello
[22:52:33] <khurram> is it night time ? every one sleeping
[22:52:41] <DanAKAHollywood> Argh! This editor is making me want to shoot myself in the face!
[22:52:54] <khurram> wkmanire: r u awake?
[22:52:58] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: Whats wrong?
[22:53:00] <wkmanire> khurram: Nope
[22:53:16] <wkmanire> khurram: I didn't really understand your question
[22:53:21] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Let me upload the latest of this terrible test and I'll let you see...
[22:53:23] <wkmanire> and my best guess still left me with no further input for you.
[22:53:29] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: Okeydokey
[22:53:30] <khurram> :0
[22:53:32] <khurram> lol
[22:54:20] <khurram> to have this assurity the request did not come from a BOT can W3 do some thing in HTML5 by introducing a field or whatever
[22:54:42] <wkmanire> Just use a captcha
[22:54:44] <wkmanire> and call it a day
[22:55:00] <khurram> GOOD DAY ....
[22:55:13] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: http://jotr.me/test.html
[22:55:42] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: It is rough and very ugly, I've been piecing it together in a single file as I go just to get a workable concept of the editor
[22:56:20] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: Are you using any references?
[22:56:24] <wkmanire> This sort of code has been hacked time and again.
[22:56:33] <wkmanire> There are probably 50 open source projects to pull algorithms from.
[22:56:47] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: I've been staring at google docs and tearing it to pieces, that is it.
[22:57:18] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Making the key bindings work and trying to make the layout of the document work is killing me
[22:57:26] <Danniel> hi, there's a way to do a refresh page when have new content?
[22:57:36] <DanAKAHollywood> Plus it doesn't display properly in IE
[22:58:02] <DanAKAHollywood> I am considering that a lesser priority since I don't even have a copy of IE to test with
[22:58:54] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: Microsoft.com doesn`t display properly in IE.
[22:59:05] <wkmanire> don't beat yourself up for it.
[22:59:15] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Everything is aligned to the left in IE
[22:59:36] <DanAKAHollywood> And it doesn't honor width: 100% by any means
[23:00:00] <DanAKAHollywood> Nor top or anythings else.
[23:00:16] <wkmanire> but these are CSS issues mostly.
[23:01:00] <DanAKAHollywood> It displays in Chrome and Firefox properly so I'm happy with that. My problem is trying to turn a div into a damned editor.
[23:01:36] <thathurts> hey guys if you have if statements in your loop such as if (providers[i].nm.toUpperCase().indexOf(nameValue) != -1), would it be more efficient to make a function that got the value of providers[i].nm.toUpperCase().indexOf(nameValue) and then in your loop, you just call that function?
[23:01:38] <wkmanire> There is one editor I saw
[23:01:40] <wkmanire> Cloudwriter?
[23:01:42] <wkmanire> skywriter?
[23:01:50] <wkmanire> They use a canvas I believe and they actually do font rendering in Javascript.
[23:01:57] <wkmanire> so they're handling their own display.
[23:02:03] <wkmanire> no CSS problems.
[23:02:12] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: That has been taken over by Ajax.org and they turned it into an IDE.
[23:03:34] <wkmanire> Still open source right?
[23:03:58] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Yes, and very bloated and overkill for this
[23:04:55] <wkmanire> hmm...
[23:05:04] <DanAKAHollywood> What I'm doing is creating a more social oriented and user friendly version of Google Docs
[23:06:09] <DanAKAHollywood> I have already figured out how to extract styles and text from Pages, ODF, Word 2000+, and all of that but I am absolutely stuck on the wysiwyg end.
[23:06:11] <wkmanire> http://piratepad.net/QTK2bEVxoK
[23:06:19] <wkmanire> This one is pretty social
[23:06:49] <wkmanire> Just trying to dig up ideas for ya.
[23:06:51] <wkmanire> :)
[23:07:02] <knapper_tech> i would like to loop through elements infinitely
[23:07:28] <knapper_tech> i can set an interval, but then how do i select a div using my iterator variable?
[23:07:36] <DanAKAHollywood> I looked at piratepad, orginially it was editpad until Google snatched it up.
[23:07:46] <knapper_tech> or is there a way to run each() infinitely?
[23:08:57] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: The problem I run into is most of the online editors aren't geared as word processors. They don't support margins, indent and all of that good stuff like an office application does. For an online publishing site, that is crucial
[23:09:09] <wkmanire> knapper_tech: so you just want to keep iterating through the same set of elements until some exterior condition is met?
[23:09:25] <wkmanire> DanAKAHollywood: So you need typesetting.
[23:09:29] <wkmanire> not just character editing.
[23:10:12] <knapper_tech> wkmanire:  yes.  i'd also like to externally manipulate the iterator.
[23:10:30] <DanAKAHollywood> wkmanire: Yes
[23:10:36] <knapper_tech> wkmanire:   ie i can click on a button to jump to a particular point in the iteration.
[23:10:55] <wkmanire> knapper_tech: You need to do this iteration in a timeOut or interval.
[23:11:59] <knapper_tech> wkmanire: okay, i have that part done.  how should i go at the selector problem?  i have an iterator, and i'm doing a hide()/show() on divs with id's set by another loop
[23:12:15] <knapper_tech> <div id="n"/> basically
[23:15:55] <knapper_tech> id like to write $('#' + n) or something similar
[23:15:55] <wkmanire> knapper_tech: You need to implement a type of collection
[23:16:05] <wkmanire> and build an iterator object  as well.
[23:17:21] <tmayr> knapper_tech: you can do that
[23:26:40] <wkmanire> tmary: You don`t want to run that selector on every iteration if you can avoid it.
[23:26:57] <wkmanire> knapper_tech: that was meant for you sorry
[23:33:25] <sunscreen> tnx for that snippet btw
[23:33:34] <sunscreen> :D saved me allot of bloatation
[23:44:55] <juha___> everybody has aids! aids aids aids
[23:46:19] <coldhead> true story bro
[23:47:38] <juha___> indeed
[23:57:18] <juha___> so, we're now left behind? no more stupid people preaching? PARTY TIEM!
