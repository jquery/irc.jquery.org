[00:17:41] <lalalalala> Hi
[00:19:23] <lalalalala> how can I send the name of a function (functionDoThis) as a parameter to a different function (functionChooseFunctionToRun), so that the parameter can be used to call the respective function
[00:19:24] <lalalalala> ?
[00:20:04] <NodeX> functionChooseFunctionToRun();
[00:20:17] <anli> Verdana as bold gets wider, has anyone encountered that problem?
[00:20:23] <anli> I get an unintentional linebreak
[00:20:34] <anli> When the hover style is in play
[00:21:22] <lalalalala> NodeX: functionChooseFunctionToRun(parameter1) where parameter1 = functionDoThis | functionDoThat, etc
[00:21:33] <lalalalala> so the var is parameter1
[00:21:47] <lalalalala> which will contain the name of the function to ru
[00:21:48] <lalalalala> run
[00:22:15] <lalalalala> but I don't know how to use that var in order to call the function of which name it contains
[00:26:19] <NodeX> you have to use apply();
[00:26:38] <NodeX> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[00:34:24] <lalalalala> when I use apply(), I receive the error: object functionDoThis has no method apply
[00:41:24] <mvk> i'm trying to select li items from which the class is not empty (But i dont know what the class will be)
[00:41:52] <mvk> this worked in a previous jquery version, 1.7.1 but not with IE8 ,     $('.mainmenu li:not[class==""]').find("a").css("color",'#fff');
[00:42:30] <mvk> but with 1.8 this selector li:not[class==""]  doesnt seem to work, what should my selector look like, i googled a bit, but cant find the right answer
[00:43:44] <oal> How can I make sure a function is run on an element once it appears on the page?
[00:45:13] <mvk> oal: by using $(document).ready(function(){}); ?
[00:45:38] <mvk> oal: google > jquery document ready
[00:45:47] <oal> mvk: it's not there from the start. It'll be inserted at a later time
[00:46:51] <mvk> after its inserted,. just add <script>your script</script> without doc ready
[00:46:57] <mvk> and it'll be exectued at runtime
[00:47:32] <oal> The thing is I need to capture when it's inserted, which I don't know how to do
[00:51:34] <mvk> oal: more specific, what do you mean with > i dont know when its added
[00:52:17] <oal> mvk: found out I could use $('body').on('mouseover mouseout', '.newEl', function() {...});
[00:53:22] <sjobidoo> Hi guys :)  Hoping one of you might help me out with a little animation issue. Trying to animate all the boxes above the element I hover over. This is what I got so far:  http://jsfiddle.net/e39La/2/
[00:53:56] <sjobidoo> As you see, only the element one hovers over animates..but I wish to animate all the boxes ABOVE the element being hovered over..and not my hovered element or any elements below it :)
[00:57:40] <sjobidoo> Nm..figured it out..wasn't aware there was an prevAll() function :)
[01:02:13] <mvk> i have a menu, in which one li element has a class, why doesnt this work (0 length)......................  $('.mainmenu li').filter(function(){$(this).attr('class')!=""})
[01:03:15] <munichlinux> mvk: better thing to do is to have a class and get element by the class name.
[01:06:03] <mvk> munichlinux: the classname is dynamic (current-red, current-blue, current-green) etc
[01:06:59] <munichlinux> mvk: in any case you want to get element by that class?
[01:07:34] <mvk> yes, i want the first element with a class!=''
[01:08:10] <mvk> unrecognized expression: .mainmenu li[class!=""
[01:08:14] <mvk> ohmy :'(
[01:08:26] <Cork> mvk: you want to select on things that exist not what isn't there
[01:08:40] <munichlinux> Cork: +1
[01:09:01] <mvk> Cork: normally i do, in this case.... =)
[01:09:15] <munichlinux> mvk: so you add a class to those element like no-color and select by that
[01:09:42] <Cork> or you make a default listener and make exception for the classes
[01:09:43] <mvk> why is it that hard to filter class==""
[01:09:47] <mvk> !=
[01:09:57] <Cork> mvk: its not supported in css
[01:10:01] <Cork> so you have to do it in js
[01:10:05] <Cork> and that makes it slow
[01:10:19] <Cork> the browser can find all elements with a specific class really fast
[01:11:14] <mvk> ok, but if i try it in JS, $(".mainmenu li).filter(function(){$(this).attr("class") != ""})
[01:11:22] <Cork> so it's not that its not doable, its that you shouldn't do it that way cause the other way will work almost as easy, but faster in the long run
[01:11:22] <mvk> doest seem to work either, why? :/
[01:11:33] <Cork> mvk: you need a return
[01:11:41] <kurrataW> hi, i have <select multiple="multiple"> field to witch i add all kinda options. Is there some jquery trick to scrol scrolbar to bottom so user always would see last entry?
[01:11:43] <Cork> js doens't have implisit returns
[01:11:45] <mvk> correction > $(".mainmenu li").filter(function(){$(this).attr("class") != ""})
[01:12:01] <dblosevn> implicit lol
[01:12:07] <Cork> $(".mainmenu li").filter(function(){ return $(this).attr("class") !== ""; })
[01:12:21] <Cork> and you want prop not attr
[01:12:26] <Cork> $(".mainmenu li").filter(function(){ return $(this).prop("class") !== ""; })
[01:13:10] <Cork> mvk: the biggest problem of all with that implementation is that its not future safe
[01:13:29] <Cork> mvk: if you later want to make additional styling you would have to change this code
[01:13:29] <mvk> well, this seems to work =)
[01:13:30] <mvk> $(".mainmenu li").filter(function(){return $(this).attr("class") != ""}).find("a").css("color",$('.mainmenu li').filter(function(){return $(this).attr("class") != ""}).data('fadeto-color'));
[01:13:43] <Cork> cause this code assumes that it has sole control of the elements
[01:13:48] <dblosevn> that whole prop vs attr thing confuses me :-( hopefully nobody upgrades jquery in any of my older apps because they will surely break lol
[01:14:04] <Cork> mvk: and thats a REALLY bad design decision
[01:14:08] <munichlinux> dblosevn: unit test dude!
[01:14:24] <mvk> Cork: i'm afraid i can only agree
[01:14:31] <dblosevn> mvk: ya that would make the browser wish it had a beer
[01:14:55] <Cork> dblosevn: in old jquery versions attr was both prop and attr
[01:15:10] <mvk> Cork: but right now, the company i work at -> they have changed the design of the site like a gazillion times now
[01:15:20] <dblosevn> Cork: I know hence why I said I hope nobody upgrades jquery on my older projects
[01:15:21] <Cork> dblosevn: so the difference when prop was added is that its more consistent
[01:15:26] <mvk> while it should have been done already; its quick, and very dirty => i agree
[01:15:48] <mvk> but its not up to me, to make it well written
[01:16:00] <dblosevn> mvk: your not the developer?
[01:16:01] <mvk> i'm the only dev in the office with jquery experience, of 10dev's
[01:16:05] <Cork> mvk: adding the class in the script is a little modification
[01:16:16] <dblosevn> thought it was always up to the developer to write well writtin code
[01:16:26] <Cork> it takes little time to do, and it makes all the code clean
[01:16:36] <mvk> Cork: you mean, adding a 'not-selected' class to the non selected item
[01:16:44] <Cork> yes
[01:16:47] <mvk> and thus filter on things that do exist
[01:16:49] <Cork> or what ever you want to call it
[01:17:18] <Cork> then all you have to do is .removeClass('not-current').addClass('current-what-ever')
[01:17:24] <mvk> Cork: ok, i will fix it :), i dont write dirty code
[01:17:34] <Cork> and the other way around
[01:17:37] <dblosevn> cant think of a time i ever needed a not selector that i didnt come up with a positive solution using what i could match
[01:18:02] <Cork> i normally use a selector for all elements
[01:18:13] <Cork> and filter on the classes for the overrides
[01:18:14] <dblosevn> either that or select all the elements and apply the class then remove it from the elements that shouldnt have it
[01:18:26] * Cork nods
[01:18:45] <Cork> css is quite fast to show you when your doing it as its expected to be done
[01:18:49] <dblosevn> but it would be much cleaner to have a selected vs not selected clas
[01:18:51] <Cork> everything becomes easier :)
[01:19:16] <dblosevn> gah i gotta be up in 2 hours
[01:19:28] <dblosevn> cant sleep gotta drive 100 miles in the morning
[01:22:16] <Cork> ouch sleep tight
[01:22:27] <dblosevn> ph ok i see, my code shouldnt break because of prop vs attr, I always used it the right way anyways, only to get and set attribs i set in the markup
[01:22:32] <dblosevn> *oh
[01:22:49] <dblosevn> eg... rel, href etc
[01:28:23] <siovene> Helo.
[01:28:49] <siovene> Hello*, how can I use .closest() to exclude "this" item?
[01:29:13] <mvk> thanks for headsup Cork, $(".mainmenu li.activeitem a").css("color",$(".mainmenu li.activeitem").data('fadeto-color'));
[01:29:23] <mvk> works a lot better
[01:29:25] <siovene> I could do $this.parent().closest('.foo') but maybe there's a better way?
[01:44:44] <Cork> siovene: closest doesn't check the current element
[01:45:02] <Cork> siovene: do you mean exclude the closest parent?
[01:46:22] <Cork> hmm
[01:46:27] <Cork> damn
[01:46:36] <Cork> siovene: your right, didn't know that
[01:50:15] <Cork> siovene: so ya, parent().closest() would be the best solution

[02:37:09] <UltraMC> Cork, hi there. As sual bull-s-eye
[03:08:54] <Mosselmaniac> hi all
[03:09:29] <Mosselmaniac> i'm using jquery validation to validate input fields. i have the min attribute in place: min="15". It works like a charm, however, when the field has decimals in it, it goes wrong
[03:09:57] <Mosselmaniac> the validation fails when the input is > 15,xx
[03:10:11] <Mosselmaniac> other words, if i use a comma the validation fails all the time.
[03:10:26] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: what happens if you use . instead of , ?
[03:11:52] <Mosselmaniac> then it doesn't validate because not a valid number ;-)
[03:12:10] <Cork> so the plugin can't handle decimal number at all
[03:12:17] <Mosselmaniac> Here in Holland we require numbers to be 9,95
[03:12:28] <Cork> ya, thats not a valid number in js though
[03:12:30] <Mosselmaniac> Cork, yes it does, but only in my 'locale'.
[03:12:31] <Cork> so you need to convert it
[03:12:38] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: not in js
[03:12:42] <Mosselmaniac> ah, in the min function?
[03:12:45] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: its the same here
[03:13:00] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: but its still doesn't make it a valid js number :)
[03:13:25] <Cork> ?eval var a = 10,5;
[03:13:29] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing variable name
[03:13:33] <Cork> ?eval var a = 10.5;
[03:13:34] <bot-t> Cork: undefined
[03:13:34] <Mosselmaniac> return this.optional(element) || value >= param;
[03:13:48] <Mosselmaniac> lol
[03:14:03] <Cork> so you will have to convert it from a string local, to a js number
[03:14:13] <Mosselmaniac> ok, how to? :)
[03:14:25] <UltraMC> Cork about this .one() - When function is fired I want to allow firing it again after a second. one() seems not to suit
[03:14:26] <Cork> ?eval a = "10,5".replace(',', '.')
[03:14:26] <bot-t> Cork: "10.5"
[03:14:48] <Cork> UltraMC: then you want to use a normal event listener
[03:16:00] <Cork> UltraMC: simplest is prob to use if($(this).data('disabled') { return; }; $(this).data('disabled, true); var $self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { $self.removeData('disabled');}, 1000)
[03:16:03] <UltraMC> Cork well... I have function fire on keyup ENTER to submit ajax call - when ajax is not finished user can press ENTER again and it generetes anotehr call before first was finished
[03:16:29] <Mosselmaniac> Cork: works
[03:16:34] <Mosselmaniac> Cork: ty sir.
[03:16:39] <Cork> np
[03:16:40] * Mosselmaniac applauds
[03:17:02] <Mosselmaniac> I adjusted the jquery validation js though... hmm never mind.
[03:17:37] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: you cold alwasy sugest it as a patch for the main plugin
[03:17:48] <Cork> (possibly behind an option)
[03:17:59] <UltraMC> Cork could you show how to implement this soultion in http://jsfiddle.net/tTj42/ ?

[03:19:53] <foofoobar> Does someone also has problems clicking on the "show info div" for facebox (http://defunkt.io/facebox/) ?
[03:20:32] <PBDev> http://pastebin.com/KZrAWTqU
[03:20:36] <foofoobar> Because it looks like this (chrome): http://imgur.com/xKaHY
[03:20:48] <Cork> foofoobar: you mean the "view the info div in the facebox" ?
[03:20:59] <foofoobar> Cork: exactly
[03:21:14] <fALSO> seems that the bacground image is smaller than the box
[03:21:14] <foofoobar> It looks broken here (as you can see in the screenshot I posted)
[03:21:26] <foofoobar> in Firefox it works
[03:21:45] <foofoobar> so I'm wondering if this is related to my browser or if you also have the same problem
[03:22:02] <Cork> foofoobar: looks weird in all browsers for me if theres text in them
[03:22:15] <Cork> (pre loading images or showing just text)
[03:22:18] <foofoobar> Cork: okay, thanks. Then I'm going to look for an alternative
[03:23:08] <UltraMC> Cork, line if (event.which == 13) { throws "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier "
[03:23:29] <foofoobar> Cork: ah, found a pull request on github which may be related: https://github.com/defunkt/facebox/pull/49

[03:24:37] <Cork> socialhapy: looks related ya
[03:26:03] <Cork> UltraMC: the error i get is in your code at the top
[03:26:08] <UltraMC> Cork you missed closing ); :P Yet it gives no result mate
[03:26:13] <UltraMC> Wanan see it live?
[03:26:50] <Cork> UltraMC: i closed all apprentices in the fiddle
[03:26:57] <Cork> and, an not needed
[03:27:00] <Cork> *na
[03:27:54] <Cork> UltraMC: or wait did you not get it working?
[03:28:04] <UltraMC> Cork, you should see it, maybe I described it badly. http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/cms/ <- click blue button on top left, type something and press ENTER quickly few times - youwill see
[03:28:11] <Cork> (missed that last part of that sentence)
[03:29:02] <Cork> UltraMC: your not setting the time for the timer
[03:29:10] <Cork> so it clears the value directly
[03:29:17] <Cork> (more or less)
[03:29:21] <UltraMC> here? setTimeout(function() { $self.removeData('disabled'); });
[03:29:24] <Cork> yes
[03:29:51] <Cork> setTimeout(function, [timeout in milisecond])
[03:30:01] <UltraMC> setTimeout(function() { $self.removeData('disabled'); } , 1000); ?
[03:30:05] <Cork> yes
[03:30:26] <UltraMC> Cork woah cool! its working
[03:30:34] <Cork> if you want longer blocking then 1 second just make it higher
[03:30:57] <Cork> another alternative is to make it block until the ajax call responds
[03:31:17] <Cork> thats prob a better option then an arbitrary timer
[03:31:42] <Cork> $.ajax.always(function() { $elm.removeData('disabled'); });
[03:33:02] <Cork> or if theres a risk for really fast ajax responses, put the timer in there
[03:33:31] <UltraMC> Cork, it seems to complex :)
[03:33:39] <Cork> its not
[03:33:43] <Cork> its really simple
[03:33:53] <UltraMC> I cant find docs on this one
[03:34:41] <Cork> ?.ajax
[03:34:42] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[03:34:52] <Cork> search for deferred
[03:35:10] <Cork> but ya you would have to use $.ajax instead of $.post
[03:35:24] <Cork> (though i see little point in using $.get or $.post my self)
[03:35:28] <UltraMC> Cork why nesting it in outer function fails? http://jsfiddle.net/6tWCj/
[03:35:47] <UltraMC> is $(this) not loaded in this case?
[03:36:06] <Cork> this is defined in the event callback
[03:36:15] <Cork> you need to forward it to the function call
[03:36:31] <UltraMC> timeouter($(this)); right?
[03:36:32] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/6tWCj/1/
[03:36:34] <xorn> http://tinyurl.com/9j7p5f5 can anyone tell me why i cant draggable() the second element?

[03:37:05] <xorn> wtf? second
[03:37:21] <xorn> no not for me
[03:37:29] <xorn> workin here
[03:37:33] <Cork> xorn: are you using a local ip in the link?
[03:37:41] <xorn> nope
[03:37:57] <Cork> well can't access it
[03:38:17] <xorn> hm impossible
[03:38:23] <xorn> anyone too?
[03:38:34] <UltraMC> Cork, are you sure about function timeouter($self) ? shouldnt it be function timeouter(self) ?

[03:40:23] <xorn> weapon values
[03:40:28] <xorn> not a cheat it self
[03:40:48] <Cork> xorn: your using id's in an invalid way
[03:40:54] <xorn> weapon values ... nothing to do with "cheating"
[03:40:55] <Cork> it can ever only be on one element
[03:41:00] <Cork> use class
[03:41:31] <Cork> xorn: so the id matches the first element cause it has an id
[03:41:41] <Cork> and the second element doens't match cause it doen't (cause its invalid)
[03:41:47] <xec_> i cringe a little every time you use "your" when it's supposed to be "you're" ;)
[03:41:56] <Cork> lol
[03:42:03] <xorn> Cork: hm ok. this is the reason that the toggle wont work too?
[03:42:09] <Cork> yes
[03:42:16] <Cork> xorn: be sure to fix both of those errors
[03:42:22] <Cork> they're quite important

[03:46:12] <PBDev> i.e. whatever was the first selection remains the same through out
[03:46:24] <Cork> UltraMC: ah, you moved the return too
[03:46:31] <Cork> UltraMC: that won't work :)
[03:46:56] <UltraMC> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/6tWCj/1/ ?
[03:47:20] <Cork> UltraMC: http://jsfiddle.net/6tWCj/2/
[03:47:39] <PBDev> don't know how to use fiddle but here it is
[03:47:42] <PBDev> http://jsfiddle.net/2MFbD/
[03:47:54] <PBDev> getmodels.php is working fine
[03:47:58] <PBDev> so is html portion
[03:48:04] <PBDev> I think there is something wrong here
[03:48:06] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/2MFbD/1/
[03:48:36] <Cork> what is it you're trying to do?
[03:49:20] <sunbeam> how do i check with jquery whether a tablet (in portrait view) is opening my site?
[03:49:47] <PBDev> just basically whenever a car make is selected, in the model dropdown, all models belong to that make should appear
[03:49:50] <PBDev> so I used ajax
[03:49:55] <PBDev> this is actually working
[03:49:59] <PBDev> very close to finish
[03:50:13] <PBDev> its just that it doesnt chage
[03:50:29] <Cork> guessing but you might want to be using html instead of append?
[03:50:45] <Cork> its a little to little context in your fiddle to tell
[03:51:14] <Cork> btw your returning false from the event handler
[03:51:23] <Cork> that will prevent the select modification
[03:51:32] <Cork> that could also be what you have problem with
[03:53:10] <PBDev> you are right. changing append to html did the trick. thanks!
[03:53:16] <xorn> Cork: ok it works for me, but now i cant get rid of the slidetoggle
[03:54:40] <Cork> xorn: don't see any slideToggle where is it?
[03:54:45] <Cork> ah there it is
[03:55:21] <Cork> xorn: you should be removing the id's they'r invalid
[03:55:30] <Cork> either replace them with a class, or make them uniq
[03:55:51] <Cork> thats cross the board
[03:57:39] <Cork> xorn: and finnaly $(this).attr('#weapon_row01').slideToggle() makes no sence
[03:58:05] <xorn> hm
[03:58:07] <xorn> k
[03:58:14] <Cork> what is it your trying to do?
[03:58:20] <xorn> so i replace the id's with class
[03:58:36] <Cork> (and # with . in the css)
[03:58:55] <xorn> F5
[03:59:04] <xorn> i try like at the first one now
[03:59:11] <xorn> click top right
[03:59:59] <Cork> ya, your getting whats expected
[04:00:49] <Cork> replace $('#weapon_row01') with $(this).nextAll('<a valid class selector>')
[04:01:23] <xorn> Cork: F5
[04:01:50] <Cork> so replace $('#weapon_row01') with $(this).nextAll('.weapon_row01')
[04:02:15] <xorn> Cork: done
[04:02:19] <xorn> well!
[04:02:34] <xorn> i am happy xD
[04:02:41] <Cork> only the doctype missing
[04:02:44] <Cork> then your set :)
[04:02:47] <xorn> ye i know
[04:03:00] <xorn> but this is only a first step in a big tool..
[04:03:08] <xorn> which doctype you would prefer?
[04:03:45] <Cork> xorn: you might want to block the click action on dragstart
[04:03:56] <Cork> and enable it with a delay on dragstop
[04:04:05] <Cork> (say 50 ms)
[04:04:08] <xorn> Cork: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"    "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"> this one?
[04:04:22] <Cork> na, just <!doctype html>
[04:04:31] <xorn> hm why
[04:04:39] <Cork> thats the html5 doctype
[04:04:39] <eLenoAr> html5 ;)
[04:04:50] <xorn> done
[04:04:53] <xorn> kk
[04:04:55] <Cork> its the last html version there'll ever be
[04:05:02] <xorn> hehe k
[04:05:18] <Cork> nice
[04:05:34] <Cork> xorn: i don't think you need the a tag in the dropdown
[04:05:39] <Cork> you don't use it anyway :)
[04:05:44] <sunbeam> window.innerHeight < window.innerWidth
[04:05:47] <sunbeam> window.innerHeight > window.innerWidth
[04:05:47] <sjobidoo> is it possible to use prevAll() to select all previous elements of current same element..BUT ..exclude elements which has a certain class? :)
[04:05:49] <sunbeam> when you use an tablet in portrait mode, both are true
[04:05:52] <xorn> Cork: block the click action on dragstart?
[04:05:52] <sunbeam> anyone knows how come?
[04:05:53] <Cork> xorn: <a href="#"> <-- that one
[04:06:01] <xorn> Cork: yes you right i aint use it
[04:06:12] <xorn> will be deletet
[04:06:26] <Cork> oooh jqueryui has a new design
[04:06:35] <OnyxWork> Hello. I'm trying to grab a template from an element in an external file. It's working fine but I have a problem with tables: I guess jQuery passes the HTML to browser for parsing and it dumps my template tags outside of <table> element since it's technically incorrect syntax. Any way around this? (see http://jsfiddle.net/pb7rf/ for an example, different code, same problem)
[04:07:00] <xorn> Cork: so "block the click action on dragstart" what did you mean?
[04:07:01] <Cork> xorn: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#event-start
[04:07:39] <Cork> xorn: as the arrow is the target for the drag, if a user starts to drag it might be nice if the flyout doens't appear when they drop it
[04:08:03] <xorn> ye
[04:08:17] <xorn> hm ok i indeed
[04:08:20] <Cork> its an enhancement, but i think it would feel more solid if it did
[04:08:30] <xorn> true
[04:08:31] <Lucky--> lol if in the chrome debugger you have a watch expression that is $("#bla").buttonset() it actually transforms your element. woops to debugging.
[04:08:50] <Lucky--> wondering why my damn datepicker is giving me all sorts of wacky values
[04:09:29] <xorn> Cork: but it shouldnt draggable at the arrow. only on the left image
[04:11:31] <Cork> xorn: oh, just saw another little miss add <meta charset="utf-8"> to your head
[04:12:30] <xorn> Cork: k
[04:12:30] <kendosan> can somebody please, add me a upload JQ script to my site, i really cant figure it out its been 3 weeks :(
[04:12:51] <Cork> xorn: replace handle: "img" with handle: ".weapon_icon"
[04:13:13] <kendosan> Cork, when you have free time could you help me out with uploadify ?
[04:13:21] <xorn> Cork: done
[04:13:41] * Cork nods
[04:13:45] <Cork> no more comments from me :)
[04:14:01] <kendosan> nooo cork, i need help :(
[04:14:05] <Cork> lol
[04:14:20] <ShawnRisk> hi
[04:14:23] <Cork> kendosan: can't see you're question
[04:14:36] <kendosan> i want to add uploadify to my script
[04:14:41] <kendosan> but its just not working
[04:14:41] <Cork> ok?
[04:14:46] <ShawnRisk> hi Cork
[04:14:55] <Cork> you have a link and can you define "not working" ?
[04:15:03] <Cork> ShawnRisk: ello
[04:15:18] <kendosan> http://142.4.196.242/
[04:15:33] <kendosan> i have tried to add it so many times but it never uploads file,
[04:15:55] <kendosan> cork, can you please put a demo.html page into the zip ?
[04:16:17] <Cork> O_o'
[04:16:32] <kendosan> if you look down the page, it says download this script, i want to have a demo.html in the zip   that shows uploading working so i can add it
[04:16:32] <Cork> you don't even include the uploadify script
[04:16:49] <kendosan> i did but i deleted after i failed so many times :(
[04:16:58] <Cork> ...
[04:17:06] <kendosan> thats why i want somebody that has experience to show me how to do it
[04:17:29] <Cork> kendosan: come with a page where you've gotten as far as you can (not a live site)
[04:17:29] <kendosan> when i add uploadify, when i get upload compelete, where does it save the file ?
[04:17:32] <kendosan> that is confusing me
[04:17:37] <Cork> ex use js fiddle
[04:17:43] <Cork> ?p @ kendosan
[04:17:43] <bot-t> kendosan, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:17:50] <kendosan> its not a live site its a testing area
[04:17:58] <Cork> when you've gottent to where you get stuck ask for help
[04:18:03] <kendosan> ok i will put together uploadify
[04:18:11] <kendosan> i will be back 5 mints
[04:18:21] <xorn> Cork: do you know a paper for me where i can learn how i drag these div's in an area (perhaps another div) where they get conditioned and shown with alle the onformation in a table row by row. to comparing them.. like here http://i.imgur.com/ajabk.png
[04:19:31] <Cork> xorn: you mean you drop them in an area and this info is shown?
[04:19:51] <Cork> or do you want to show the info when you hover the mouse over them or something?
[04:19:52] <xorn> Cork: yes
[04:20:02] <xorn> drop them
[04:20:13] <Cork> thats basically the droptarget in jquery-ui
[04:20:19] <xorn> and then fit the data into an tbale
[04:20:19] <AlbinoGeek> Not sure this is a topic for jQuwery, but not sure where else to ask.  Who here knokws what the browser compatability is right now for minified resources being served gzipped.  ie: jQuery.js.gz / someStyle.css.gz
[04:20:31] <kendosan> ok i got the demo, http://142.4.196.242/upload/
[04:20:38] <kendosan> now when it uploads where does it save file ?
[04:20:39] <Cork> what you need to connect them is something uniq added to the "weapon" element
[04:20:44] <kendosan> where do i put target folder ?
[04:20:50] <AlbinoGeek> I mean, works for me in FF16 (and saves over 70% of the filesize!)  but not sure what other browsers support it.
[04:21:14] <Cork> kendosan: the upload is sent to the uploadify.php script
[04:21:21] <Cork> strongin depends on that server script
[04:21:24] <kendosan> Cork, ok im going to open it
[04:21:28] <Cork> *storing
[04:21:31] <xorn> Cork: i could give them a new class by php over my mysql output
[04:21:35] <xorn> Cork: would this be ok?
[04:21:47] <PBDev> QUESTION: This is a jquery/css question. Everything works fine. When I select a Make, the form moves to the right and slightly down. No idea why from the CSS.
[04:21:52] <kendosan> it says, $targetFolder = '/uploads'; // Relative to the root
[04:21:52] <kendosan>   
[04:21:59] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: close to 100% support
[04:22:02] <kendosan> does it mean its in /var/www/uploads ?
[04:22:03] <PBDev> check it out http://tow.pureblue.co.uk/index.php?pageType=page&page=mailing-list
[04:22:10] <kendosan> or in /var/www/uploads/uploads ?
[04:22:13] <ShawnRisk> If I run this code: http://jsfiddle.net/a5f44/11/ by pushing the run button on jsfiddle, almost everything works.  There are three problems: One is that if I click on sublink the sublinks don't show up when the page loads.  Another problem is that the toplinks are not highlighted at all to say that is the section it is on if I click the sublinks.  Last problem, the toplink highlighted stays all the time, when if I hover over other
[04:22:23] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: all main browsers has supported gzip for the last 12 years at least
[04:22:45] <Cork> that includes things like links and lynks
[04:22:47] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: Sorry, back.  So why is NOBODY doing it then?
[04:22:59] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: many are
[04:23:09] <NodeX> most "sane" people do gzip
[04:23:12] <kendosan> Cork, in uploadify where do i set the extensions allowed ?
[04:23:22] <NodeX> most web servers offer on the fly compression
[04:24:02] <Cork> kendosan: http://www.uploadify.com/documentation/uploadify/filetypeexts/
[04:24:17] <Cork> a few positions doens't compress
[04:24:19] <kendosan> i just added $targetFolder = '/downloads';   and upload txt file and it does not appear in downloads folder
[04:24:21] <Cork> mostly for mobile apps
[04:24:27] <kendosan> this is the problem im having :(
[04:24:39] <Cork> then its cause they don't want the cpu overhead on the weak clients
[04:24:51] <Cork> but now days most any mobile hw can handle it
[04:25:18] <sunbeam> window.innerHeight < window.innerWidth
[04:25:22] <sunbeam> window.innerHeight > window.innerWidth
[04:25:25] <sunbeam> when you use an tablet in portrait mode, both are true, anyone knows how come?
[04:25:33] <AlbinoGeek> NodeX: Just went to a few sites, couldn't find a single one that was serving gzipped css or js, let alone even minified :(
[04:25:34] <Cork> kendosan: might be configuration problems with your web server
[04:25:46] <kendosan> :( but i dont understand
[04:25:49] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: doens't have to be visible
[04:25:51] <Cork> its a http header
[04:26:03] <kendosan> im using debian 6, lighttpd, php5  thats it
[04:26:38] <OnyxWork> kendosan, did you check pure php upload? might be permissions on the folder you're trying to upload to
[04:26:41] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: I use Firebug, I can see the headers.  The files being served to me are monolithic uncompressed files.
[04:26:43] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: ex. from the page i just linked to kendosan "Content-Encoding	gzip"
[04:26:52] <kendosan> it has 755
[04:26:58] <NodeX> AlbinoGeek : just because the file ext is not .gz doesn't mean it's not gzipped ;)
[04:26:59] <kendosan> im checking it all over again
[04:27:01] <eLenoAr> kendosan: try to set the path without the slash -> $targetFolder = 'downloads'
[04:27:04] <Cork> ya
[04:27:11] <kendosan> ok i will try thanks
[04:27:18] <Cork> the extension doesn't mean anything in http
[04:27:49] <Cork> kendosan: you need to check the max post body size and things like that
[04:27:59] <Cork> kendosan: if you hit that the message will be thrown away
[04:28:05] <kendosan> im testing with simple png
[04:28:12] <kendosan> everything looks alright
[04:28:13] <Cork> check your error.log
[04:28:14] <sunbeam> nvm
[04:28:21] <kendosan> but no png in folder when upload complete
[04:28:53] <Cork> kendosan: like i said check your lighttpd config and error.log
[04:29:19] <kendosan> like to but hmm not sure where to check :(
[04:29:28] <Cork> you need to make sure that the server accepts the file size + the base64 encode overhead
[04:30:06] <ShawnRisk> I know my question is huge and complex but would be good if someone could attack this.
[04:30:58] <Cork> kendosan: you could try asking in #lighttpd for help with the server config
[04:31:12] <kendosan> so much to do just to get uploading work :(
[04:31:24] <Cork> yes its not "just" ;)
[04:31:44] <Cork> kendosan: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6135427/increasing-the-maximum-post-size  you need to config php too
[04:31:54] <eLenoAr> kendosan: error.log --> tail -f /var/log/lighttpd/error.log
[04:33:04] <xorn> Cork: what do i have to read? droptarget in jquery-ui?
[04:33:10] <kendosan> just checked the log, it only shows my bash ffmpeg script which is ok but nothing else for uploading
[04:33:20] <kendosan> so i believe size in php.ini is not problem
[04:33:28] <kendosan> problem maybe with the uploadify code
[04:33:35] <Cork> ?g jquery-ui dragtarget
[04:33:37] <bot-t> Cork, Droppable | jQuery UI - http://jqueryui.com/droppable/
[04:33:44] <Cork> xorn: ^
[04:34:26] <kendosan> can somebody please give me a fullly working demo upload script ?
[04:34:56] <kendosan> i mean just to unzip and it works ? is it possible
[04:35:10] <Peanut017> I have an application that should run for days on end. But having tested it for a night it showed a big increase in used memory. IE it was using 80mb.
[04:35:13] <seutje> the dawn of copy/paste is long gone, my friend
[04:36:08] <Peanut017> I've found that this happens whenever I change the value inside a div or add remove a div.
[04:36:20] <Peanut017> Does anyone else know anything about it?
[04:38:41] <hallas> got an issue regarding an cross origin requests

[04:39:21] <hallas> the resource I'm requesting has Access Control Allow Origin: *
[04:39:40] <kendosan> Cork you willing to log into my VPS and check what the hell is wrong with the upload ?
[04:39:46] <kendosan> im willing to give the login to you
[04:44:01] <ShawnRisk> hi seutje
[04:44:09] <seutje> ShawnRisk: hey
[04:44:28] <ShawnRisk> seutje: what has replaced cut/paste?
[04:44:43] <seutje> ShawnRisk: logic and independent thinking
[04:44:52] <ShawnRisk> okay
[04:45:12] <ShawnRisk> seutje: do you have time to go over my questions today or are you super busy?
[04:45:35] <seutje> ShawnRisk: I already did, didn't I?
[04:45:57] <ShawnRisk> seutje: yes and no
[04:52:00] <ShawnRisk> seutje: do you want to try and finish this up, if not I will move on
[04:52:19] <seutje> ShawnRisk: finish what up?
[04:52:43] <ShawnRisk> ummm…. helping me with jsfiddle :)
[04:53:47] <reloadz> hi! is this type of selection possible?
[04:53:47] <reloadz> $('input[name="ctg[]" && value = "' + value + '"]')
[04:55:52] <seutje> $('input[name="ctg[]"][value="' + value + '"]')
[04:56:16] <garulf> Hi guys.. how can I take the width of an element without the scrolling bar width?
[04:56:26] <seutje> might have to escape ctg[], but think it's fine when quoted
[04:56:27] <seutje> reloadz: ^
[04:56:34] <ShawnRisk> seutje: newest code: http://jsfiddle.net/a5f44/11/
[04:56:45] <ShawnRisk> a simple no and I will move on
[04:56:49] <reloadz> thx
[04:56:58] <garulf> or alternatively how can I take the width of a scrolling bar
[04:56:59] <garulf> ?
[04:57:56] <seutje> ShawnRisk: how did u break the active thing?
[04:59:55] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I did?
[05:00:14] <enoch> guys im having a problem
[05:00:41] <enoch> using prependTo doesn't work in some div and i can't figure why
[05:01:51] <seutje> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/a5f44/21/
[05:02:05] <seutje> no need to query active again
[05:02:16] <seutje> and I added some stuff to make that highlight class follow along
[05:05:50] <seutje> fucking fiddle
[05:08:11] <seutje> ShawnRisk: the active state fails onload, but press run again and it'll work
[05:08:34] <seutje> ShawnRisk: this is due to window.location.href being different onload and when run is pressed
[05:11:29] <ShawnRisk> seutje: okay that works, but if I click the sublink the toplink is not highlighted and the sublinks don't show up.
[05:15:44] <seutje> ShawnRisk: oh, so when u click a sublink, that menu is suppose to remain open?
[05:16:02] <seutje> so then what happens when you mouseleave that menu?
[05:17:31] <ShawnRisk> seutje: yes if I click the sublink, the toplink should be still highlighted and the sublinks showing when the new page loads.
[05:18:28] <sunbeam> i've got a div that contains a form and has x amount of pixels, it should move down and make place exactly for another hidden div which slides in from the left
[05:18:32] <sunbeam> any idea how i can best do this?
[05:18:48] <ShawnRisk> seutje: if I click the toplink the mouseleave works when I leave the menu.  Yet when I click sublinks don't work the same way.
[05:18:58] <seutje> ShawnRisk: lol, "when the page loads"
[05:19:02] <seutje> that logic is already there
[05:19:20] <seutje> the sublinks don't do anywhere, so there is no "when the page loads"
[05:19:36] <ShawnRisk> seutje: well on my dev site that is the problem
[05:20:17] <seutje> ShawnRisk: and how are those hrefs constructed?
[05:20:32] <seutje> the active link's href doesn't match window.locaiton.href?
[05:20:36] <seutje> window.location.href*
[05:22:02] <ShawnRisk> seutje: on dev site: http://example.com/events on the site but in the code it is href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/events/"
[05:23:27] <seutje> so is that a yes or a no?
[05:24:55] <sunbeam> seutje: you maybe know?
[05:25:04] <ShawnRisk> seutje: they match up
[05:25:49] <seutje> ShawnRisk: so $('a[href="' + window.location.href + "']').length is over 0?
[05:28:47] <ShawnRisk> seutje: yes it is 1
[05:32:08] <seutje> ShawnRisk: then I have no clue why it isn't grabbing it as active
[05:38:40] <ShawnRisk1> seutje: sorry my computer died before I knew it would
[05:38:54] <lindii_> is there anything wrong about setting up the format date in js and not in php?
[05:41:14] <ShawnRisk1> seutje: one last thought, you understand that problem right?
[05:41:38] <seutje> ShawnRisk1: I don't really understand why it is finding an active link, but it isn't marking that menu as being active
[05:41:48] <seutje> ShawnRisk1: does it have more levels or something?
[05:42:29] <ShawnRisk1> seutje: all this menu has is one toplink and sublinks that is all.  all from what I see it is doing <ul class>
[05:43:58] <ShawnRisk> seutje: this is for each section, which there are four different sections of the menu, 1 toplink + 4 sublinks.  There are 4 toplinks in total.
[05:44:44] <ShawnRisk> lindii_: depends if you want the user to see the date code or not
[05:47:07] <notafrog> Is there a way to append an element and directly reference it? I wish to add a click event handler to expand/collapse buttons while adding them to a tree-type navigation.
[05:47:25] <notafrog> Or do I need to give them a class and set the event afterwards
[05:49:20] <notafrog> I read you can do $("<a>foobar</a>").appendTo(".whatever").click("..."), but I'd want to do it in the middle of traversing a navigation, without breaking the chain
[05:49:36] <ShawnRisk> seutje: is that easy to understand?
[06:06:24] <sunbeam> i've got a div that contains a form and has x amount of pixels, it should move down and make place exactly for another hidden div which slides in from the left
[06:06:28] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[06:07:18] <Somatt_wrk> is there a way to check if a css background image as finished loading ?
[06:07:30] <Somatt_wrk> or rather an event to listen to

[06:09:50] <jomofcw> Is there an way to know if an element is scrollable or not ?
[06:10:01] <jomofcw> Is there an easy* way to know if an element is scrollable or not ?
[06:11:05] <kborchers> jomofcw: you could probably just compare scrollHeight to height
[06:12:14] <jomofcw> kborchers : hello ! this one ? https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/DOM/element.scrollHeight
[06:13:36] <kborchers> jomofcw: yep
[06:13:54] <jomofcw> kborchers is that crossbrowser plz ?
[06:15:18] <kborchers> jomofcw: i believe most browsers support but they may return different vals
[06:16:43] <sunbeam> kborchers: is there also a way to do this without?
[06:19:28] <mobile8> how can i best find the parent ul id when a ul li a{} is clicked?
[06:19:29] <jomofcw> kborchers OK thanks, i'll try it.

[06:23:00] <mobile8> thanks!!
[06:23:53] <foofoobar> so I'm suing face box (lightbox alternative) to display a div where a jvectormap is inserted
[06:24:06] <foofoobar> SHowing the jvectormap not inside the face box works without a problem

[06:24:44] <mobile8> kborchers: how can i find whether its the 1st, 2nd etc li clicked in this ul ?
[06:24:51] <foofoobar> What does it make for a difference if an element is loaded inside a facebox?

[06:33:29] <NodeX> $("#div-id").size()
[06:33:45] <NodeX> if($("#div-id").size()==1) { ....
[06:33:59] <ShawnRisk> seutje: do you think it goes through the if statement twice?
[06:34:00] <NodeX> I think you can also use .length too
[06:34:19] <seutje> ShawnRisk: iono, log something in it and see if it gets logged twice?
[06:34:27] <ShawnRisk> okay
[06:34:43] <mobile8> NodeX: thanks
[06:36:03] <foofoobar> Any hints for me?
[06:38:21] <cool> Hello Everyone
[06:39:36] <Lucky--> element.checked = (element.value == value || element.value.toString().toUpperCase() === value.toString().toUpperCase()); - the only way i could get this to work - but it feels wrong on so many levels. what am i missing here?
[06:41:21] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I tried a number of console.log statements but nothing is showing up on page load to see what is going on
[06:41:25] <cool> Guys, I am trying to calculate Gross Amount which is Net Amount + tax rate(%) but I get NaN as result. what am I doing wrong here? here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/A9vmg/17/
[06:43:30] <sunbeam> @media only screen and (min-device-width : 320px) and (max-device-width : 600px) {}
[06:43:34] <sunbeam> with this do I catch most smartphones including iPhone 4-5 ?
[06:44:33] <converge> I have this $load function , is that possible to add a loading image when loading the page ? http://paste2.org/p/2379927
[06:47:05] <ShawnRisk> seutje: seems I am confused.
[06:47:09] <timing> converge: just add <img src="spinner.gif" /> into #products
[06:47:23] <timing> converge: in the html, $.load will overwrite the spinner once loaded
[06:48:20] <foofoobar> So when I have an jvectormap working. Now, when I try to "move" this div and get the data via $('#myJVectorMap').html() and append() it to another element, the handlers for clicking etc. are not working anymore
[06:48:34] <foofoobar> What can I do prevent a "copying" of the html() source
[06:48:35] <lindii_> hey guys.. how can i do if i want to show and hide submenus once i click employees or clients here http://jsfiddle.net/uCtuk/1/
[06:48:43] <foofoobar> Instead I want to move the div itself in this object
[06:49:09] <converge> timing: do you mean like it? http://paste2.org/p/2379944
[06:51:57] <seutje> ShawnRisk: me too, man, me too :P
[06:52:00] <timing> converge: yeah! and if you position the spinner nicely it can actually look good :-)
[06:52:27] <converge> timing: i'll try that, thanks
[06:52:37] <ShawnRisk> seutje: you want to see dev site, would that help?
[06:53:09] <Manxa> will setTimeout() stop the execution of javascript?
[06:53:19] <NodeX> no
[06:53:23] <Manxa> darn
[06:53:28] <seutje> ShawnRisk: guess it can't hurt
[06:53:31] <NodeX> alert(), confirm() are both blocking
[06:53:39] <NodeX> document.write is blocking iirc
[06:54:24] <Manxa> NodeX: i have xmlReponse's return response i depned on
[06:54:39] <Manxa> i don't want to set async to false as it will halt the page
[06:54:54] <ShawnRisk> seutje: pmed you the info
[06:54:59] <Manxa> i just want to halt the execution of the script for a few seconds while xmlReponse.response returns
[06:55:29] <lindii_> =/
[06:55:45] <NodeX> Manxa : you can't do that
[06:55:56] <NodeX> though iirc jquery has promise() or something
[06:56:00] <NodeX> ?promise
[06:56:00] <bot-t> .promise([type], [target]): [New in v1.6] Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[06:56:04] <Manxa> NodeX: well damnit.  that's no good
[06:57:23] <Manxa> NodeX: so i no choice *but* to wait for the response
[06:58:42] <ShawnRisk> seutje: you see the menu?
[06:58:54] <seutje> yeah, trying to figure out where the menu JS is at
[07:00:55] <seutje> ShawnRisk: btw, there's some text before the DTD, IE will prolly go into quirks cause of that
[07:02:56] <daveace> zup
[07:03:18] <ShawnRisk> seutje: this is inserted into the page directly not on a separate js file yet
[07:03:30] <seutje> ShawnRisk: could you put this in a separate file, it's rly hard to debug on a live site if the JS is inline :(
[07:03:40] <ShawnRisk> seutje: also you are looking at the Community Info Forums Help page right?
[07:03:44] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I will do that right now
[07:03:47] <OnyxWork> seutje, IE has other modes than "broken"? :P
[07:03:56] <chasep_notworkin> Is there a way to disable/change the text/change the style of the buttons on a dialog? I'm capturing information which is submitted via one of the dialog buttons, and I'd like to display a progress bar in it's place (or, at the very least, disable the buttons) until the processing is finished.
[07:04:31] <seutje> ShawnRisk: was looking at membership-details
[07:05:08] <ShawnRisk> seutje: right, moving js code now
[07:05:18] <seutje> ShawnRisk: hmz, on that page I find 5 links that link to the current page
[07:05:29] <chasep_notworkin> I've found a work around, where I save the buttons object locally, update it to an empty object, then display a progress bar in the dialog itself, and after processing is complete, I hide the progress bar, and add the buttons back
[07:05:37] <ShawnRisk> seutje: one sec
[07:06:07] <lindii_> how can i show and hide submenus clicking employees or customers liker here http://jsfiddle.net/uCtuk/1/
[07:06:19] <lontrax> Please, I'm new to jQuery... a simple question, in one external file .JS I must have many "$ (document). ready (function () {..." or just one for the whole file??
[07:06:23] <daveace> can i ask for a hand at a piece of jquery that i cant get to work?
[07:06:39] <seutje> lontrax: you don't even need any if your JS is at the bottom of the page
[07:06:41] <daveace> it works on my pc, but when i up to the site it goes tits up
[07:06:47] <seutje> lontrax: but aside from that, one should do :)
[07:06:57] <kickandrew> daveace: got a jsfiddle?
[07:07:20] <seutje> lontrax: also, $(function() {}) is a shortcut for $(document).ready(function() {}) iirc
[07:07:23] <lontrax> seutje: thank you very much!
[07:07:26] <daveace> so i can play the saddest song in the world?
[07:07:35] <daveace> ;/
[07:07:46] <daveace> i just pastebin'd it
[07:07:54] <klawd> hi! can i bind an onmouseout to an element that will not trigger when i hover a child element?
[07:08:20] <seutje> klawd: just stopPropagation on the child elements
[07:08:20] <lindii_> ?
[07:08:21] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I have moved the menu to topmenu.js
[07:08:27] <klawd> aye, thanks
[07:09:05] <kickandrew> daveace:  I don't see the link, can you post it again
[07:09:13] <seutje> wtf, why won't chromesies let me do local edits?
[07:09:20] <daveace> http://pastebin.com/AJm9Jtzu
[07:09:39] <daveace> the button parts work, where it changes their style
[07:09:54] <seutje> lol wrong tab
[07:09:55] <daveace> but it doesnt seem to want to load up the right pages on the menu link clicks, nor load it up on start up
[07:10:57] <CIDIC> is there a way around this? http://pastebin.com/ytTH4yFA
[07:11:08] <CIDIC> the xthis variable?
[07:11:28] <CIDIC> I run into this a lot with click events and such as well.
[07:11:31] <mobile8> how do I get the current top position of some #div ?
[07:11:35] <ShawnRisk> seutje: moving the js helped?
[07:13:38] <seutje> ShawnRisk: yeah, the active thing is matching 5 links
[07:13:58] <ShawnRisk> seutje: something I did wrong?
[07:14:31] <klawd> seutje: no success with that.
[07:15:43] <lindii_> how can i show and hide submenus clicking employees or customers liker here http://jsfiddle.net/uCtuk/1/
[07:15:43] <seutje> ShawnRisk: your sublinks aren't wrapped in LIs
[07:15:58] <Motafoca_> im using the autocomplete jquery, but when i load the custom css file its changing the style of some other items of my page
[07:16:01] <daveace> oh god, i think i got it
[07:16:05] <seutje> it's like <ul><li><a>foo</a><ul><a>poo</a></ul></li></ul>
[07:16:20] <Motafoca_> i isolated the theming to ui-menu and ui-widget-content
[07:16:35] <Motafoca_> how to make jquery only style the autocomplete?
[07:16:46] <ShawnRisk> seutje: yes and it should be?
[07:17:03] <seutje> klawd: oh, I misunderstood, use mouseleave instead
[07:17:04] <ShawnRisk> seutje: that is how the jsfiddle is made
[07:17:14] <seutje> ShawnRisk: nope
[07:17:27] <ShawnRisk> seutje: oh
[07:17:33] <seutje> fiddle is <ul><li><a>foo</a><ul><li><a>poo</a></li></ul></li></ul>
[07:17:37] <seutje> note the inner LI
[07:18:00] <seutje> ShawnRisk: this is causing the siblings link to return results it isn't expecting
[07:18:03] <daveace> capitalization of .php files
[07:18:13] <daveace> that's why :P
[07:18:29] <ShawnRisk> seutje: should I wrap the <a>'s in <li>'s than?
[07:18:35] <seutje> yesh
[07:19:10] <Benftwc> Hi
[07:20:07] <ShawnRisk> seutje: trying
[07:20:29] <seutje> klawd: http://jsfiddle.net/S3t33/
[07:21:26] <dhavalt> :q
[07:21:54] <ShawnRisk> seutje: what about the toplinks?  Should they be in <li></li>'s too?
[07:22:07] <seutje> lol, yea
[07:22:11] <ShawnRisk> okay
[07:22:20] <seutje> ShawnRisk: and you should put the UL for the sublinks inside of that LI
[07:22:39] <seutje> you know, like a regular nested list
[07:22:57] <klawd> seutje: that is odd. that's the behaviour i would have expected
[07:23:10] <seutje> klawd: mouseleave != mouseout
[07:23:22] <klawd> ah!
[07:23:25] <seutje> mouseenter and mouseleave don't re-trigger for child elements
[07:23:29] <seutje> mouseover and mouseout do
[07:23:34] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I have updated, tell me if that is what you want or if not what this should be.
[07:23:38] <seutje> ?g msdn mouseenter

[07:23:46] <sunbeam> i've got a form, that has to have margin-top: 100px added, when this is added the form should slide down 100px
[07:23:50] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[07:23:51] <seutje> yeah, nvm that link lol
[07:24:33] <jomofcw> Is there a way to add a param data to each AJAX request by default ? please.
[07:24:42] <seutje> ?ajaxsetup
[07:24:43] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxSetup(options): Set default values for future Ajax requests. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[07:24:57] <ShawnRisk> seutje: seems to be working now
[07:25:17] <Benftwc> Hi, how to use somes REST functions with jQuery ?
[07:25:21] <seutje> ShawnRisk: well, on some pages, there's 2 submenu's with active links
[07:25:36] <ShawnRisk> seutje: like which page?
[07:25:38] <seutje> ShawnRisk: like on membership-details, both community and help are active
[07:25:46] <jomofcw> seutje hello :), but it will merge the data with the new one I give ?
[07:26:07] <seutje> ?tias @ jomofcw
[07:26:08] <bot-t> jomofcw, Try It And See
[07:26:13] <Cork> Benftwc: there are a plugin that makes it even simpler then it is by default
[07:26:26] <Benftwc> Cork : Wich one ?
[07:26:47] <Cork> Benftwc: but all you need to do is $.ajax({ type: 'action', url: '' });
[07:26:50] <barryhjames> Is there a way to do an animate where you do a slide down and an append within the animate?
[07:26:56] <Cork> (by default)
[07:26:57] <ShawnRisk> seutje: not for me.  I only see active under Help
[07:27:11] <ShawnRisk> seutje: in community I see ul class
[07:27:24] <Cork> ?g jquery.rest
[07:27:27] <bot-t> Cork, lyconic/jquery.rest  GitHub - https://github.com/lyconic/jquery.rest
[07:27:36] <Cork> Benftwc: ^
[07:27:48] <seutje> ShawnRisk: well, all the links under community link to the same page
[07:27:48] <Benftwc> Cork : Thanks ^^
[07:27:51] <Cork> Benftwc: but honestly, its not needed
[07:28:07] <Benftwc> Cork++
[07:29:43] <ShawnRisk> seutje: because you are logged out
[07:29:50] <jomofcw> seutje it seems to erase it :/... so it doesn't work.
[07:29:52] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I mean not login
[07:30:11] <ShawnRisk> seutje: but I get what you mean.
[07:30:14] <seutje> jomofcw: hmz, can't u access the original object from within there?
[07:31:02] <jomofcw> seutje hm I'm not sure to understand what you want me to do.
[07:31:02] <seutje> ShawnRisk: if you want to avoid that, add .first() after the whole var $active = ...
[07:32:13] <jomofcw> seutje perhaps I can add it using beforeSend ?
[07:32:58] <seutje> jomofcw: like $.ajaxSetup({beforeSend: function(jqXHR, settings) { settings.foo = 'bla'; }});
[07:33:39] <seutje> jomofcw: yeah, that was what I meant, sry for teh confusion
[07:33:45] <jomofcw> seutje yup, I'll try it.
[07:34:06] <seutje> jomofcw: I do think that any ajax call that defines a beforeSend explicitly, will override this one
[07:34:08] <ShawnRisk> seutje: would that make the first link in community active or the first link that I click active i.e. if I click membership under help that will becoming active?
[07:34:29] <seutje> ShawnRisk: the first link it finds that happens to have the same href as the current page
[07:34:59] <ShawnRisk> seutje: okay
[07:35:10] <sunbeam> have a div slide away by adding margin-top + 100px
[07:35:15] <sunbeam> is this possible?
[07:35:30] <ShawnRisk> seutje: I did this, var $active = $('a[href="' + window.location.href + '"]').first(); if you want to test this out go ahead
[07:35:50] <Otineb> Hi everyone. I am trying to get an email field validated before allowing the user to click submit. My current form works marvelously on EVERY browser except Internet Explorer and I cannot figure out why. Can anyone take a look with me? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/NUYYq/3/ Perhaps there's a better way of doing this?
[07:37:09] <seutje> ShawnRisk: yeah, now it only flags one as active
[07:37:15] <jomofcw> same problem seutje :/ If I set a beforeSend in my local ajax call, it won't call the default one :/.
[07:37:29] <seutje> jomofcw: that's what I said!
[07:38:10] <Jimu> I want to stop this slide panel from bouncing when you leave it and re-enter it: http://jsfiddle.net/8qbyU/
[07:38:39] <ShawnRisk> seutje: thanks, I will keep that in mind what you said.  Thank You again for your hard help on this
[07:38:56] <jomofcw> SebastianFlyte yup :/... but, reading some article, each say that data should merge oO So I should do something wrong
[07:39:56] <jomofcw> This is correct ? $.ajaxSetup({data:{ajax:1,foo:'bar'}});
[07:40:15] <Otineb> Can anyone help?
[07:40:25] <sunbeam> have a div slide away by adding margin-top + 100px
[07:40:26] <sunbeam> is this possible?
[07:40:32] <barryhjames> I am having a problem with this drop down menu.  When the drop down slides back up, the text disappears before the slide up finishes.  How would I get the text to empty and the slide up to happen at the same time?  http://jsfiddle.net/MikesBarto2002/eb3c4/4/
[07:41:36] <barryhjames> http://jsfiddle.net/MikesBarto2002/eb3c4/
[07:43:10] <ShawnRisk> seutje++
[07:43:39] <jomofcw> i'm using ajaxSubmit from the form plugin, perhaps the error come from there.
[07:44:04] <^Mike> Hi, I have "$.ajax({type:'POST',data:JSON.stringify(object)...})" but when my object contains some value that is "??", it gets POSTed to the server as something like "jQuery152005867563048377633_1351176052640" instead. Is that a known bug, or...?
[07:45:27] <sunbeam> isn't there some easy way/plugin that lets me specify an element, and slide this element xx amount of px down?
[07:45:38] <seutje> Jimu: add a .stop() before animating
[07:45:41] <Saaether> barryhjames, http://jsfiddle.net/eb3c4/5/
[07:45:51] <seutje> Jimu: it'll cause it to end any animation that's in progress
[07:46:34] <seutje> Jimu: http://jsfiddle.net/8qbyU/1/
[07:46:43] <seutje> Jimu: also, consider using hoverintend
[07:46:56] <jomofcw> seutje according me it's a ajaxSubmit bug, do you know where can I post a report about it ?
[07:47:03] <seutje> it delays the callback for a bit so you're "sure" the user wanted to trigger it
[07:47:20] <barryhjames> Saaether: Thank you so much!  I was racking my brain for an hour on this one.  Thanks!
[07:47:23] <Jimu> seutje: thanks!
[07:47:28] <Saaether> np
[07:47:44] <seutje> jomofcw: http://bugs.jquery.com ?
[07:48:22] <jomofcw> seutje I can post bug report about plugin ?
[07:48:42] <seutje> jomofcw: lol no, file it on the plugin's site/repo
[07:50:57] <jomofcw> seutje OK thanks I find malsup on Github ^^
[07:52:01] <lindii_> how can i show and hide submenus clicking employees or customers liker here http://jsfiddle.net/uCtuk/1/
[07:54:24] <ShawnRisk> I have to go
[07:55:15] <sw33tlull4by> hi there, i have a nasty problem with google-maps-api and jquery-mobile,  hope s.o. can help me out here, this is the code i need working http://jsfiddle.net/XJ566/5/ , works like a charm WITHOUT jquery-mobile, and this is the same code with jquery-mobile http://jsfiddle.net/92ZLV/
[07:57:21] <lontrax> Please, how I can add more one style to same class? I tried this but does not work properly:   $('.faq dt').css('margin-bottom', '25px', 'color', 'red');
[07:58:55] <boulet101010_> Aicasn: go on mate! you could add a class to the objects of the same class
[07:58:59] <boulet101010_> w00ps
[07:59:05] <boulet101010_> s/lontrax/Aicasn
[07:59:25] <boulet101010_> s/Aicasn/lontrax
[08:00:04] <sw33tlull4by> lontrax, you can use a map
[08:00:32] <lontrax> sw33tlull4by: map? how? sorry, I'm new in jquery...
[08:00:59] <sw33tlull4by> $('.faq dt').css({'margin-bottom': '25px', 'color': 'red'});
[08:01:49] <sw33tlull4by> http://api.jquery.com/css/ 2nd css-definition in the top page 3rd sub-example, or s.th. like that
[08:02:01] <Cork> sw33tlull4by: that's an object not a map
[08:02:11] <Cork> js doens't have map data types
[08:02:12] <lontrax> ahhh i forgot only "}"?  :-)
[08:02:24] <sw33tlull4by> Cork, yes but jQuery refereces them as map in their documentation
[08:02:31] <Cork> O_o'
[08:02:39] <CodesStuff> It's true, they do.
[08:02:40] <lontrax> sw33tlull4by: thank you!
[08:02:41] <Cork> seriously?
[08:02:44] <CodesStuff> Yep
[08:02:46] <CodesStuff> Silly jquery.
[08:02:50] <CodesStuff> I DEMAND A REVISION!
[08:02:51] <Cork> ya...
[08:02:59] <Cork> (not the revision part)
[08:03:03] <CodesStuff> lol
[08:03:33] <Cork> that explains some of the confusions i've seen
[08:03:35] <sw33tlull4by> well it sort of makes sense though since they use them as maps or associative arrays
[08:03:41] <sw33tlull4by> or whateve ryou want to call them
[08:03:49] <Cork> objects
[08:03:53] <CodesStuff> ^
[08:03:57] <sw33tlull4by> :)
[08:04:04] <Cork> that's what they are true and true
[08:12:41] <seutje> btw jomofcw: https://github.com/malsup
[08:15:49] <lindii_> well
[08:15:53] <lindii_> =/
[08:23:28] <sw33tlull4by> fyi i solved the problem here is the thread i wasn't finding before http://forum.jquery.com/topic/google-maps-inside-jquery-mobile interesting what events are needed for in jQ-mobile http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a2/#docs/api/events.html  and this is my working code http://jsfiddle.net/92ZLV/3/ FINALLY, now i can release a bit of steam and throw this crapload of a computer outta the window :)
[08:25:10] <sw33tlull4by> i really would never ever have thought about looking for events on this problem,  events are usually reserved for actions and not really for layout....-.-
[08:25:27] <sw33tlull4by> oh well tonight i go to sleep a little smater: :D
[08:25:32] <jackp10> hi to everyone
[08:27:45] <jackp10> I have a dialog window that load a page with the load function. inside this page, there is another link who should submit a form, and the result comes back within the same dialog box. The problem I am facing is that i cannot attach my own event to the "close" button that comes with the last page
[08:28:07] <jackp10> I have tried to use the .on( click, function() {} ) but it doesn't seems to work
[08:28:27] <jackp10> any idea why ?
[08:31:18] <xec_> jackp10: any errors in console? (like "click is not defined")
[08:32:41] <xorn> Cork: when u toggle the first weapon . you see the text bevor the div slide down is ready. how can i fix that?
[08:33:15] <CodesStuff> Maybe when the animation is complete .show() or .fadeIn()
[08:33:27] <jackp10> xec_: it say that $("input[type=button]").on is not a function
[08:33:50] <xec_> jackp10: interesting, maybe you're running an old jquery version?
[08:34:20] <CodesStuff> jackp10: $("input[type=submit]")
[08:34:40] <xec_> jackp10: what do you get if you type $.fn.jquery in the console?
[08:34:41] <CodesStuff> (I didn't look at your fiddle if you had one - just assuming you're selecting it wrong :P)
[08:34:43] <Cork> xorn: what was the link again?
[08:34:47] <xorn> http://tinyurl.com/9j7p5f5
[08:35:13] <tw2113> jackp10, it looks like on() was added in 1.7
[08:35:20] <jackp10> i have changed to .on with .live to see if it works.. I got read of the "not a function" problem
[08:35:37] <CodesStuff> jackp10: Got a jsfiddle?
[08:35:43] <jackp10> but when I click on the "close" button generated by the second loaded page, it does not get my own custom event
[08:36:00] <Cork> xorn: btw code.jquery.com isn't a cdn, you shouldn't load your script files from thre
[08:36:05] <Cork> *there
[08:36:23] <Cork> (it can be VERY slow at times)
[08:36:34] <CodesStuff> xorn: https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery
[08:36:39] <xorn> Cork: ok i will load them from there
[08:37:00] <jackp10> In fact I am using JQuery 1.6.
[08:37:15] <xorn>  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script> like this?
[08:37:32] <jackp10> but how come the .live event does not catch the click button ?
[08:37:43] <jackp10> I don't understand it
[08:37:48] <CodesStuff> xorn: Yes
[08:37:57] <xorn> fixed
[08:38:15] <CodesStuff> jackp10: Are you sure you're selector is right? Are you able to get any attributes from it?
[08:38:39] <Cork> xorn: weird, that shouldn't happen
[08:38:45] <jackp10> no.. I have tried to alert the .click event, and it doesn't fire it
[08:38:45] <Cork> xorn: let me dig a bit
[08:39:23] <And--> hey guys.. what can it be wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/uCtuk/2/
[08:39:36] <jackp10> but I am sure I am getting the attribute right
[08:39:36] <joflow> anyone around that can help with nested getjson issues ? i need to feed a value from the first request to the second, however $.each doesnt seem to like it
[08:39:47] <CodesStuff> jackp10: Can you make a jsfiddle?
[08:39:48] <jackp10> this is what I see in the page: <input id="close" class="button" type="button" onclick="dlCose();" value="Close" name="close">
[08:39:54] <CodesStuff> It will help the debug process
[08:40:01] <CodesStuff> ?demo
[08:40:01] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:40:02] <jackp10> ok
[08:41:00] <Cork> xorn: ah, your absolute positioning all the child elements
[08:41:25] <Cork> xorn: set the flyout to position: relative; and recalculate the positions of the values
[08:41:32] <And--> im building a menu
[08:41:34] <Cork> (or don't use position: absolute)
[08:42:21] <xorn> Cork: argh ok
[08:42:40] <Cork> xorn: position: relative; on the parent is prob the simplest solution
[08:42:52] <Cork> (and you should have done that from the start :)
[08:42:58] <xorn> k.. recalculate sucks.. but ok
[08:43:01] <And--> anyone can point me to the right direction?
[08:43:12] <Cork> xorn: that makes the flyout an offset parent for the child elements
[08:43:19] <xorn> Cork: just learning ;9
[08:44:27] <Cork> xorn: everyone starts at some point :)
[08:44:35] <Cork> xorn: theres only one way forward :)
[08:45:21] <xorn> Cork: tru
[08:45:34] <xorn> and keeps me look forwoard ;)
[08:53:26] <joflow> anyone have some time to help with a nested getjson request ?
[08:54:45] <MacroMan> And--, No li has a UL inside it.
[08:54:59] <And--> ok yes
[08:55:02] <And--> i have seen it
[08:55:04] <And--> thanks
[08:55:41] <MacroMan> I've not actually seen this format before: $("li:has(ul)")
[08:55:55] <MacroMan> is has() a css selector?
[08:56:06] <Cork> ?ask @ joflow
[08:56:07] <bot-t> joflow, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:56:45] <Cork> MacroMan: theres a few functions that you can use inside the jquery selectors
[08:56:59] <Cork> MacroMan: but its a bad idea unless you have to use them
[08:57:15] <Cork> (ex. you want to pass it as a config parameter)
[08:57:22] <MacroMan> Cork, OK thanks
[08:57:39] <Cork> MacroMan: the function is called for each element thats matched
[08:57:53] <Cork> and it calls the normal function ( in this case .has() )
[08:58:17] <Cork> and its slower then doing $('li').has('ul')
[08:58:25] <Cork> so no point in doing it
[08:58:27] <MacroMan> Cork, So the same as doing an if (has()) { inside the click function than
[08:58:57] <MacroMan> Ah you can do it before the click as well like that. Cool
[08:59:00] <Cork> $('li').has('ul') is the exact same thing as $("li:has(ul)"), just faser
[08:59:02] <joflow> right, sorry. i'm very new to jquery so don't all shoot me at once. the problem with this code is that jquery iterates through the first returned json object first before it moves on to the next one. http://pastebin.com/rVwGUF4h
[08:59:14] <Cork> *faster
[08:59:27] <MacroMan> Cork, Thanks for explaining
[08:59:33] <Cork> np
[08:59:46] <CodesStuff> One thing I noticed about this channel is we take shifts in helping people.
[09:00:07] <CodesStuff> There are always at least two people that require help and it gets extremely stressful after the first 30 minutes.
[09:00:18] <CodesStuff> I'm not sure how Cork has lasted this long tbh :3
[09:00:34] <Cork> lol
[09:00:47] * MacroMan makes Cork a coffee/tea/strong alcoholic beverage
[09:01:18] <Cork> joflow: so you want to combined the two getJSON calls into one?
[09:01:29] <Cork> joflow: if not i don't really follow what the question is
[09:02:24] <sw33tlull4by> later....
[09:02:27] <Cork> joflow: or do you mean that the second getJSON call happens after all the first getJSON calls is done?
[09:02:55] <Cork> looking closer that's prob your question
[09:02:56] <joflow> cork: nope, that's whats happening now. i want both calls to fire with each iteration
[09:03:14] <Cork> joflow: you can't use .each
[09:03:34] <joflow> cork: the first call gets me the album name and album id. i plug the albumid into the second request to get the url, i then want to display the name/image next toe ach other
[09:03:40] <joflow> thats what i thought - what are my other options ?
[09:03:43] <Cork> joflow: ajax is async, that means that the active js stack has to end before the callbacks from the ajax call triggers
[09:04:09] <joflow> ok
[09:04:17] <Cork> joflow: either build it into a data stack and then output it when your done
[09:04:17] <CodesStuff> If you do the 2nd request in the callback of the first one, you can just push the responses into the same array/object
[09:04:26] <CodesStuff> It's silly and not a good idea, though
[09:04:35] <Cork> or let it drop in async, but have references so it ends up at the correct place
[09:04:40] <CodesStuff> ^
[09:05:06] <CodesStuff> I'm a little disappointed that this channel doesn't have more discussion =\
[09:05:10] <joflow> by references, either a table or existing div's ?
[09:06:54] <Cork> joflow: you could for example add the products from the second call inside the wrapper from the first call
[09:07:04] <Cork> joflow: that way they would all be in order
[09:07:18] <Cork> or you could add an extra wrapper around it if you don't want to do that
[09:07:37] <Maverick|MSG> is it possible to get all elements with a specific attribute value range?
[09:07:39] <Cork> ah, no its just a single product
[09:08:05] <joflow> cork: i thought that's what i was doing by appending both to #outer?
[09:08:13] <Cork> joflow: wait a min
[09:09:29] <Cork> joflow: http://jsfiddle.net/kTHLN/
[09:09:43] <Cork> joflow: yes you added it all to outer
[09:10:29] <CodesStuff> Maverick|MSG: Maybe .filter() ?
[09:11:05] <Maverick|MSG> I',m trying to find all div's with an attribute of 'depth' where depth is <= 2
[09:11:14] <Maverick|MSG> haven't had much luck with filter though
[09:11:32] <Cork> but the flow was: getJSON => add element 1, and queue for related product => add element 2, and queue for related product ..... => add element 20, and queue for related product => add related product for element 1 => add related product for element 2 ... => add element for related product 20 => add element for related product 10 (if your unlucky)
[09:11:42] <Cork> joflow: ^
[09:11:43] <CodesStuff> Maverick: JSFiddle it for me. This is interesting enough that I want to help :D
[09:11:58] <CodesStuff> Just toss 2-5 divs in the HTML bit
[09:12:24] <Maverick|MSG> k, lemme put something together real fast
[09:12:38] <Cork> joflow: the loop makes it not allow the ajax calls to process
[09:12:40] <CodesStuff> Is this how it's set up, Maverick|MSG? <div data-depth="1">Depth of 1</div>
[09:12:48] <Maverick|MSG> yup
[09:13:42] <Maverick|MSG> so let's say I'm at the depth=2 div.  I want to find the next div that is depth 0 or 1
[09:14:17] <joflow> cork: great, now give me a few minutes to understand why it works now :) thanks
[09:14:37] <CodesStuff> Hmm. There are a few ways you could do that.
[09:14:38] <Cork> lol
[09:14:48] <CodesStuff> You could dump them into an array and index them by deptch
[09:14:50] <CodesStuff> Depth*
[09:15:01] <CodesStuff> Then iterate through them by depth ascending
[09:15:25] <slick-> hey I'm trying to do this function	$('#preview_image').click(alert('lol'));, instead of curing on the click of preview_image
[09:15:29] <slick-> it just happens when the page loads
[09:15:31] <slick-> any idea why
[09:15:52] <CodesStuff> slick-: .click(function(){ alert("lol");});
[09:16:03] <Maverick|MSG> CodesStuff: to give some context, the depth value is a measure of how deep into a conversation you are.  depth 3 means you are 3 replies deep
[09:16:06] <slick-> oh
[09:16:31] <slick-> not working
[09:16:35] <CodesStuff> Maverick|MSG: I see, so it has to be in order.
[09:16:43] <Maverick|MSG> right
[09:16:47] <slick-> when i click on the element nothing happens
[09:17:09] <Cork> $('#preview_image').click(function() { alert('lol') });
[09:17:21] <Cork> slick-: you're passing the result from alert to .click
[09:17:22] <CodesStuff> :|
[09:17:25] <Cork> not a function pointer
[09:17:38] <slick-> oh
[09:17:38] <Maverick|MSG> CodesStuff: $("#mydiv").nextAll( "div[depth=0"]:first" )....
[09:17:41] <Maverick|MSG> something like that
[09:17:47] <slick-> how do i make stuff happen when preview_image is clicked
[09:17:49] <Maverick|MSG> but more like depth <= 2
[09:18:10] <Cork> function my_alert() { alert('lol'); }; $().click(my_alert); is another example
[09:18:11] <CodesStuff> Hmm
[09:18:14] <Maverick|MSG> (ignore that errant " though)
[09:18:25] <Cork> wow...
[09:18:31] <Cork> lag...
[09:19:40] <Cork> slick-: CodesStuff already answered you
[09:19:51] <slick-> its not working :(
[09:19:52] <Cork> slick-: and i gave you some more explanation of why
[09:20:00] <CodesStuff> console.log isn't working in FF on jsfiddle!
[09:20:02] <CodesStuff> Oh noes
[09:20:20] <Cork> CodesStuff: it does
[09:20:30] <CodesStuff> No I mean my FF is borked
[09:20:31] <CodesStuff> lol
[09:20:41] <slick-> works
[09:20:42] <Cork> CodesStuff: if you're using firebug you might get stolen messages some times though
[09:20:43] <slick-> i love all of u
[09:20:55] <Cork> check in ctrl+shift+k
[09:21:31] <Cork> CodesStuff: ^
[09:21:57] <CodesStuff> yeah I did, Cork. I think my Firebug is out of date
[09:22:05] <CodesStuff> I'm lazy so I just swapped over to Chrome
[09:22:10] <CodesStuff> I'll deal with FB later :P
[09:23:10] <Cork> CodesStuff: na, its the built in console that's greedy, it snatches events and won't give them to firebug from time to time
[09:23:58] <CodesStuff> Yeah
[09:24:16] <CodesStuff> Maverick|MSG: Is iterating through them not an option?
[09:24:33] <Cork> sadly its not that much firebug can do, except throw away there own console and just use the built in one (something they'r planing to do)
[09:24:39] <CodesStuff> Because var msgs = $('div[data-depth]'); fetches them in the order they appear on the DOM
[09:24:44] <Maverick|MSG> CodesStuff, yeah, that's fine.  I figured I'd have to iterate downward through them anyway
[09:24:58] <Maverick|MSG> that's the most logical way as far as I know
[09:26:19] <CodesStuff> Yeah
[09:26:24] <CodesStuff> Maverick|MSG: http://jsfiddle.net/xH7Ty/1/
[09:26:30] <CodesStuff> I'm not sure what you need to do with the data
[09:26:44] <Porpado> How can I pick out just the text in an element and not other child elements
[09:26:48] <CodesStuff> I wish there were operators available in jQuery for selection, though
[09:27:11] <CodesStuff> I mean, if you REALLY wanted to code out silly things you could dump it into a local SQLite DB and query it that way :D
[09:27:22] <Porpado> so <td><td>other shit</td>text i want</td>
[09:27:44] <CodesStuff> Porprado: .text()
[09:27:48] <Porpado> ty
[09:27:49] <CodesStuff> http://api.jquery.com/text/
[09:27:50] <CodesStuff> :P
[09:27:57] <NoiseEee> Porpado: you mean 'how can i use selectors on totally invalid html?'
[09:28:10] <NoiseEee> you'll probably have some troubles
[09:28:12] <Porpado> yes
[09:28:16] <CodesStuff> lol'd
[09:28:25] <CodesStuff> Give him a break :P
[09:28:37] <CodesStuff> It's not like Javascript is a real programming language or anything.
[09:33:16] <Cork> CodesStuff: actually text won't work, cause that text will be moved
[09:33:34] <Cork> error correction will make that into a valid dom tree
[09:33:47] <Cork> so you're selector will have to find where the error correction put it
[09:34:01] <CodesStuff> Aaaaand Cork is here to rain on my parade >=[
[09:34:07] <Cork> :)
[09:34:24] <Cork> invalid html is never even remotely ok
[09:34:33] <Cork> its the first thing you should ever fix in a webpage
[09:34:53] <Cork> before trying to figure out why the js isn't working
[09:35:06] <Cork> (cause if the html is invalid, its quite likely the cause)
[09:35:10] <joflow> cork: great, that works, *almost* what I wanted :) the second div (picbox) still ends up in a seperate wrapper. i need both picbox and newbox to end up in the same wrapper div. any ideas ?
[09:36:00] <Cork> joflow: ugg do you have the jsfiddle link?
[09:36:36] <joflow> cork: yep - http://jsfiddle.net/kTHLN/ - thanks
[09:36:48] <slick-> I have something like: var	flashMovie=getFlashMovieObject("IRVideoPlayer");
[09:36:56] <slick-> it works fine in firefox but in chrome it says
[09:37:06] <slick-> object has no method 'load video'
[09:37:08] <Cork> joflow: so you want only one wrapper for each group?
[09:37:13] <Cork> not one inside the other?
[09:37:25] <slick-> any idea why chrome is doing this? flashMovie.loadVideo("../vid/Skyfall_ITR-D-ImaxBranded-November_Eng_EAGL2_1920x1080.mp4"); //movie.mp4");
[09:37:39] <joflow> one wrapper for each group is right - wrapper->newbox & picbox
[09:37:44] <Cork> slick-: check if you have another js error in the page
[09:37:53] <slick-> thetas the only error
[09:38:35] <slick-> it says, Uncaught TypeError: Object #<htmlobject> hasn o method 'playvideo'
[09:38:41] <slick-> but it does have a method playvideo
[09:38:44] <Cork> joflow: try http://jsfiddle.net/kTHLN/1/
[09:38:59] <slick-> query is unable to load the object when i do this var	flashMovie=getFlashMovieObject("IRVideoPlayer");
[09:39:44] <joflow> cork: perfect, thanks a lot
[09:39:53] <Cork> slick-: hmm would have to see what getFLashMovieObject actually does to answer that one
[09:39:58] <Cork> joflow: np
[09:41:13] <slick-> is there a way to define it so that it fetches getFlashMovieObject from the do cement loaded
[09:41:24] <slick-> i feel that it is not able to load the object from the page
[09:44:17] <Cork> slick-: as i don't know what its meant to generate, that's hard to answer
[09:48:12] <Maverick|MSG> CodesStuff, for the depth issue, is there a way to start the iteration at a certain div?
[09:49:12] <CodesStuff> MaverickMSG: if(index >= TARGET_INDEX){ }else{ /*do nothing*/ }
[09:49:16] <CodesStuff> Inside thatr .each()
[09:49:18] <Cork> ?.slize
[09:49:21] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".slize" in jQuery Docs.
[09:49:24] <Cork> ?.slice
[09:49:25] <bot-t> .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[09:49:26] <Cork> :/
[09:49:29] <CodesStuff> Are that
[09:49:31] <CodesStuff> Or
[09:49:36] <CodesStuff> Jesus Christ I can't spell today
[09:50:09] <Maverick|MSG> yeah, the only problem I don't necessarily know the index of the starting div
[09:50:10] <Cork> so .slice(10).each(function() {});
[09:50:29] <Cork> Maverick|MSG: what do you know about the starting div?
[09:50:37] <Maverick|MSG> I know the id
[09:51:35] <Cork> so list.slice(list.index('id')).each(function() {});
[09:51:36] <Cork> then
[09:52:04] <Maverick|MSG> oh, didn't know that was an option
[09:58:30] <DeltaHeavy> Is there any preference no matter how slight how I assign colours to elements in jQuery through the 'css' method? RGB or #<hex>?
[09:59:11] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: no
[09:59:21] <Cork> jquery doesn't care, its just a string to it
[09:59:39] <Cork> the browser parses both that the same speed
[09:59:59] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Ok, thanks!
[10:00:45] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: only time you need to think about it is if you want to use alpha
[10:01:00] <Cork> cause rgba is used by all browsers except is that uses #rrggbbaa
[10:01:11] <Cork> *except ie
[10:01:39] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Awesome, thanks!
[10:01:45] <Cork> (where aa goes from 0 to 99 :/ )
[10:02:05] <Cork> got to love consistency
[10:03:03] <DeltaHeavy> Yep, I know how RBGA works but thanks
[10:03:35] <TelFiRE> if I bind a hover, and then refine my selection, and then bind a new hover, will it auto-unbind the first?
[10:03:49] <DeltaHeavy> I was also wondering how I can pass 'this' to the second function in the hover method?
[10:03:57] <Cork> TelFiRE: no
[10:04:17] <Cork> TelFiRE: the selector doens't matter, its just how you find the element
[10:04:19] <DeltaHeavy> I usually make a variable but I'd like to avoid that if there's a better way
[10:04:26] <TelFiRE> What's the proper way to unbind? I did .unbind('mouseenter mouseleave') but it gives me a error
[10:04:47] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: that is the only way
[10:05:10] <Cork> TelFiRE: unbind('hover') if that's what you bound
[10:05:15] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Thanks!
[10:05:19] <TelFiRE> Object false has no method 'unbind'  -- I think it's because it runs one time with there being no elements selected
[10:05:31] <Cork> uh.. false??
[10:05:35] <Cork> thats not a jquery object
[10:05:43] <Cork> :)
[10:06:26] <TelFiRE> Yeah it is cork, the problem is that it's selecting nothing. var products = $('#rx_products li');   products.hover(makeBig,makeSmall).hasClass('current').unbind('mouseenter mouseleave')
[10:06:39] <TelFiRE> on the very first time this runs, there will be no ".current" class yet
[10:06:51] <Cork> TelFiRE: no, jQuery never returns false
[10:06:55] <Snicers-Work2> Hey, I am looking for a responsive js library that will responsivly resize images that already have a css width or height value attributed with them. Any ideas?
[10:07:04] <Cork> it always returns a working jquery object, even if nothing is matched
[10:07:23] <Cork> TelFiRE: check so you don't have another framework on the page, like prototype
[10:07:28] <TelFiRE> Cork: your assertions fly in the face of the error I'm staring at and the code I just pasted
[10:07:50] <Cork> (prototype is notorious for returning all kind of junk)
[10:08:04] <TelFiRE> I certainly don't have any conflicting frameworks.
[10:08:23] <TelFiRE> I run jQuery in this environment all the time. I'm doing something wrong with the code I pasted.
[10:08:47] <Cork> ?demo @ TelFiRE
[10:08:59] <TelFiRE> I don't understand why it's always so difficult to convince people that my code is broken, not my environment
[10:09:29] <TelFiRE> well let me first try changing it to unbind hover instead of mouseenter mouseleave although I understood to just be an alias for that anyway
[10:10:21] <TelFiRE> still doin it
[10:10:35] <TelFiRE> Cork: //urgent.cpstest1.info/
[10:12:19] <cR0Ck> hello
[10:12:28] <cR0Ck> I would like to know if it is possible to trigger a jquery keydown event on ANY part of the document and not an input field - my example is this: http://jsfiddle.net/qS9fF/ - is this even possible?
[10:12:38] <TelFiRE> Cork: sorry im not tryin to be a jerk I appreciate the suggestions it's just my code worked before and I refactored it and now it doesn't, so I know it's not the environment
[10:12:45] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/qS9fF/1/ @ cR0Ck
[10:13:46] <Cork> TelFiRE: ya, but my statement stands, jquery never returns anything else then a jquery object
[10:13:52] <Cork> so it has to be something else
[10:14:08] <Cork> TelFiRE: so how to reproduce?
[10:14:10] <TelFiRE> you're probably right but I'm getting a false object one way oranother
[10:14:21] <TelFiRE> I'm going to try just getting rid of the unbind
[10:14:26] <TelFiRE> never binding it to that in the first place
[10:14:48] <Cork> cR0Ck: yes, you can
[10:14:56] <Cork> cR0Ck: the element just have to be focusable
[10:15:21] <cR0Ck> okk thanks guys, I fixed it :D
[10:15:25] <Cork> cR0Ck: and you do that by setting tabindex="0" on the element (dom attribute
[10:15:35] <Cork> )
[10:15:45] <cR0Ck> ahah you forgot the )
[10:15:52] <cR0Ck> (programmer's mind)
[10:16:59] <TelFiRE> oh cool now I have an object true!
[10:17:07] <Cork> cR0Ck: i didn't end the line so its fine ;P
[10:17:32] <cR0Ck> alright, but hey, I am watching ya! :D
[10:17:35] <Cork> TelFiRE: still waiting for the str
[10:17:40] <Cork> :D
[10:18:13] * Cork wonders what ppl would thing if i ended all lines with ;
[10:18:14] <Cork> :D
[10:20:26] <VeXii> is it possible to get the orginal XHR object when using $.ajax?
[10:20:46] <VeXii> wanner listen to the progres event
[10:21:13] <cR0Ck> Cork... :o? ;
[10:23:56] <tomasm-> hi, i'm trying to create my own mirror of api.jquery.com, I've downloaded the github repo, installed a new version of npm, etc.... and when I type in grunt (as per the https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/), it just says a bunch of lines ">>execvp(): No such file or directory".... not very useful. any clue what's wrong?
[10:24:13] <ajpiano> tomasm-: are you on windows
[10:24:30] <ajpiano> hold on, what do you mean create a mirror
[10:24:44] <ajpiano> api.jquery.com deploys into a local wordpress with web-base-template, do you have that configured as well
[10:24:58] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template
[10:25:14] <Cork> ?.ajaxTransport @ VeXii
[10:25:56] <tomasm-> ajpiano, I'm confused... is that separate than the wordpress, or does the web-base-template include wordpress?
[10:26:05] <Cork> wtf its not in the docs anymore??
[10:26:27] <ajpiano> it does not include it
[10:26:40] <Cork> VeXii: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[10:26:42] <ajpiano> step 2 to installing it is to download wordpress using the zipball or from git
[10:28:00] <TelFiRE> Cork: str?
[10:28:43] <Cork> TelFiRE: Steps To Reproduce
[10:29:47] <tomasm-> ajpiano, man, all i want is a searchable version of the docs... this is all a bunch of work..... isn't there some pdf or something somewhere? most of what ive seen is several years old
[10:30:28] <ajpiano> you can do whatever you want with the xml in api.jquery.com repo
[10:30:38] <ajpiano> just that grunt is going to attempt to deploy it to wordpress
[10:31:08] <ajpiano> there's a search on api.jquery.com
[10:31:24] <ajpiano> i guess it isn't the greatest
[10:31:33] <TelFiRE> Cork: I'm having trouble reproducing it
[10:32:38] <StanAccy> WIth the autocomplete widget, how does the widget get notified about which item the users selects - does the autocomplete invocation register a click handler on something?
[10:33:09] <Cork> StanAccy: yes
[10:33:46] <Cork> StanAccy: i highly recommend reading the plugin, its not that long and not very complex
[10:34:02] <Cork> and it will make it easier to understand what happens
[10:34:09] <ajpiano> StanAccy: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select
[10:34:17] <CodesStuff> Cork: Go take a break. You've been at it too long :P
[10:34:23] <Cork> lol
[10:34:34] <CodesStuff> Seriously, it's been hours.
[10:34:38] <TelFiRE> Cork: $('#rx_products li')hasClass('current')  --- you sure this is not supposed to return a boolean? It is supposed to select all lis that have that class in that id?
[10:34:52] <TelFiRE> or is hasClass the wrong thing
[10:34:54] <ajpiano> hasClass is supposed to return a boolean.
[10:35:02] <TelFiRE> well that's my problem then -_-
[10:35:05] <Cork> ?.hasClass @ TelFiRE
[10:35:11] <ajpiano> .filter(".current")
[10:35:17] <Cork> oh right the bot is down
[10:35:23] <tomasm-> ajpiano, i mean I just have a limited internet connection.....so I need copies of the docs
[10:35:41] <Cork> TelFiRE: that returns a true of false if the class exists on the first element in the list
[10:35:50] <TelFiRE> hmmm so how do I further select down that line? $('#rx_products li').????('current')
[10:35:53] <Cork> TelFiRE: filter is what you want
[10:36:06] <Cork> TelFiRE: see ajpiano's response
[10:36:11] <TelFiRE> oh missed it
[10:36:12] <TelFiRE> thank you ajpiano
[10:36:22] <ajpiano> tomasm-: there are currently offline versions of the docs here but they're as of 1.7 http://jqapi.com/
[10:36:23] <tlkr> Does anyone know how to prevent the fragment identifier from changing when selecting a tab in the new jQuery UI?
[10:36:27] <tomasm-> ajpiano, is it relatively easy enough to take the XML entries and use some XML processing library or something to translate it into html?
[10:36:48] <VeXii> hmm it dont look like the ajaxTransport provides access to the XHR object. but rather the jqXHR obj
[10:36:49] <ajpiano> tomasm-: ostensibly yeah, you could just write your own xslt to do whatever you want with the xml
[10:37:17] <tomasm-> ajpiano, is there css built in somewhere?
[10:37:37] <StanAccy> Can I insert non-selectable items in to the drop down list that autocomplete displays? (group separators) ?
[10:37:51] <ajpiano> not for a custom display
[10:37:55] <tomasm-> i see the entries2html.xsl
[10:38:08] <Maverick|MSG> CodesStuff Cork I think I resolved the depth issue, thanks to you both
[10:38:17] <ajpiano> tomasm-: if you just get web base template/wordpress running locally, you'll be able to have the whole site locally
[10:38:19] <CodesStuff> Yay :D
[10:38:21] <ajpiano> but you have to set it up properly
[10:38:28] <Maverick|MSG> lemme get a jsfiddle so you can check it out
[10:38:33] <CodesStuff> okie dokie
[10:38:43] <ajpiano> i thought you wanted some "custom search "functionality of your own
[10:38:49] <tomasm-> ajpiano, I've had a pain of a time getting npm, grunt, etc installed and working
[10:38:58] <ajpiano> are you on windows
[10:39:03] <tomasm-> ajpiano, ubuntu
[10:39:05] <tomasm-> 12.04
[10:39:22] <Cork> VeXii: optios.xhr() should give you the real object
[10:39:26] <ajpiano> which version of node do you have
[10:39:36] <StanAccy> I know its possible, Im looking for a hint on how to achieve this functionality
[10:39:41] <tomasm-> 0.8.12
[10:39:58] <Maverick|MSG> CodesStuff http://jsfiddle.net/wWRtk/
[10:40:30] <Maverick|MSG> starting at end3 it iterates down until it reaches a comment of depth 2 or less
[10:40:59] <tomasm-> ajpiano, the whole install process is honestly giving me a headache.... i may stick with jqapi
[10:41:01] <CodesStuff> Maverick|MSG: reviewing
[10:41:37] <Maverick|MSG> probably needs some cleaning/optimizing; still getting used to jquery
[10:41:42] <ajpiano> tomasm-: it seems like you haven't even set up the web-base-template or wordpress stuff , so there's no wher efor it to deploy to
[10:41:45] <CodesStuff> Maverick|MSG: You need to have custom attributes like "depth" prepended with "data-"
[10:41:48] <CodesStuff> otherwise it's not valid HTML
[10:41:57] <ajpiano> tomasm-: but yes, the point of that site is for people who want to work on and edit docs locally, not to have a local copy of the docs
[10:41:59] <CodesStuff> Aside from that it appears to be fine
[10:42:04] <Maverick|MSG> oh, right, I was just being lazy in this instance
[10:42:11] <Maverick|MSG> thanks again for the help
[10:42:46] <CodesStuff> no problem \o/
[10:43:27] <tomasm-> ajpiano, I remember there being a big change with event handlers in some version.... was that 1.8? or 1.7? As long as the changes between 1.7 and 1.8 are small, I can survive
[10:43:32] <tomasm-> w/1.7 docs
[10:43:39] <ajpiano> it was with 1.7
[10:53:41] <nchlssmith1> how could I combine $("thead th", this) and $("thead td", this)
[10:53:56] <TelFiRE> ugh my brain hurts
[10:54:02] <StanAccy> to add the groupings/separators do I need to extend the whole widget with a custom widget and overload the _renderMenu function? There doesnt seem to be a function I can pass in via Options
[10:54:16] <ajpiano> $("thead", this).find("th, td") would be what i'd do
[10:54:30] <nchlssmith1> thats awesome thank you
[10:58:13] <tomasm-> what is the 'this' for in those statements?
[10:58:30] <nchlssmith1> like this in a java class
[10:58:47] <nchlssmith1> represents the object's self
[10:58:58] <tomasm-> I know what 'this' is for in general, but that context i'm not familiar with.... as a second parameter
[10:59:15] <tomasm-> ie how is $("thead", this) different than $("thead")
[10:59:40] <nchlssmith1> it represent thead elements with in itself.
[11:00:03] <tomasm-> you mean like $(this).find('thead') ?
[11:00:10] <nchlssmith1> yeap
[11:00:17] <nchlssmith1> its just shorter
[11:03:33] <sayd> does trigger/on work across different versions of jquery? if i bind in 1.44 and trigger in 1.71 for example
[11:16:53] <TelFiRE> Is there something wrong with my function here? I get typeerror that it has no method removeClass.... why is it returning this.animate it should be an object *confused* http://jsfiddle.net/mdZeK/
[11:17:15] <matteu1> Hey everyone.  I have a quick question.  I'm running into a problem of assigning jQuery element context functions to variables and then executing those function variables.  Here is a fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/jSv5q/  Console is showing me a 'this.each' is not a function error when I attempt to do this.
[11:18:40] <matteu1> What would be a more appropriate way to handle the variable function call on `elem` in `function bufferHandle`?
[11:19:12] <TelFiRE> rofl syntax errors I hate em -_-
[11:28:19] <dns-away> spam
[11:28:41] <matteu1> I figured it out.  While `test = jQuery('#elem').html;  test('msg');` does not work, using anonymous functions solves the problem.  `test = function( msg) { jQuery('#elem').html( msg); }  test('msg');`
[11:28:43] <CodesStuff> Hi! Welcome to IRC.
[11:28:44] <CodesStuff> :P
[11:29:00] <matteu1> Although if anyone has any ability to explain why this is the case to me, I'd still be interested.
[11:29:17] <dns-away> interessed
[11:37:56] <FrameFever> how can I check the element type?
[11:38:07] <FrameFever> if its a IMG or <a>?
[11:39:47] <garciawebdev> hi
[11:40:01] <syntax> re
[11:40:10] <KWhat_Work> FrameFever: use a selector
[11:40:17] <matteu1> :FrameFever  jQuery('#myelem').is( 'a')   // will return 'true' if #myelem is an <a> element
[11:41:03] <matteu1> FrameFever: jQuery('#myelem').is( selector) // will return 'true' if #myelem is selected from the given selector
[11:41:10] <FrameFever> matteu1: is there a difference in using ' or ""
[11:41:30] <matteu1> FrameFever:  Not anything applicable to your original question
[11:41:56] <redsand> question, how can i get the html element at a specific mouse location?
[11:42:09] <redsand> i'm trying to handle a click within a contextmenu
[11:42:16] <redsand> to get the id of that div
[11:42:22] <FrameFever> matteu1: yes
[11:42:30] <FrameFever> but is there a difference?
[11:42:39] <FrameFever> I am curiouse
[11:43:16] <matteu1> FrameFever:  That is a general Javascript question.  See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/242813/when-to-use-double-or-single-quotes-in-javascript
[11:43:58] <matteu1> redsand:  you could apply a mouseover event to each element within your container that sets a trackable state of whatever element the moust is in context of
[11:45:10] <redsand> i figd it out, im gonna store the this obj in the data model of the menu div that was called and just ref it on click
[11:45:46] <Pilate> lol
[11:46:05] <xorn> Cork: is it possible to change the z-index while the drag is active? and also for the slide toggle..
[11:46:46] <FrameFever> matteu1: other question can I make a switch case for several types? switch($(elemen).type()){ case "img": ....
[11:47:00] <FrameFever> or what is the syntax for it?
[11:48:09] <Cork> xorn: not really sure what your trying to do, but yes
[11:48:14] <matteu1> FrameFever:  Your switch statement would have to use $("#elementId").get(0).tagName
[11:48:30] <syntax> Cork: i try to set the drag one over the others..
[11:48:45] <matteu1> FrameFever:  note tagName returns in all caps
[11:48:50] <syntax> take a look and they are not all on top
[11:48:54] <Cork> FrameFever: case 'img': case 'a': case 'div': break; case 'other': break; else: break;
[11:49:31] <FrameFever> is this a valid approch, which work cross browser?
[11:49:37] <Cork> kyes
[11:49:46] <Cork> *yes
[11:50:06] <kashnikov> hi
[11:50:22] <matteu1> FrameFever:  I would rely on jQuery.fn.is more than .get(0).tagName
[11:50:44] <Cork> xorn: then yes that works
[11:50:56] <kashnikov> if i put any elements in .bx-child it blocks mousenter() when using     $('.bx-child').mouseenter(function() { $('.bx-prev').css('visibility','visible');$('.bx-next').css('visibility','visible');}); - is there anyway to include all sub elements?
[11:51:18] <Cork> matteu1: hes using .type() not .get
[11:51:25] <FrameFever> matteu1: then I would have to use an else if cascade
[11:51:47] <FrameFever> Cork: ah .type() works?
[11:52:00] <matteu1> Cork:  FrameFever:  type returns the Javascript type, not the element type
[11:52:29] <xorn> Cork: so how can i get rid of that?
[11:52:36] <Cork> matteu1: $().type not type
[11:52:43] <Cork> check the code :)
[11:53:42] <Cork> xorn: just set the css for the helper element
[11:53:58] <matteu1> Cork:  does $().type exist?
[11:54:05] <Cork> xorn: sorry but can't help more, its late and i need to sleep
[11:54:07] <Cork> matteu1: yes
[11:54:22] <matteu1> Cork:  neither is it in the jquery documentation, and it doesn't work in my Firefox 15 console under jQuery 1.7
[11:55:42] <lollypopgr> hi people!
[11:56:24] <notashrimp> Is there a way to append a child element and bind an event handler to it, without breaking the chain?
[11:56:51] <FrameFever> Cork: how do I use it?
[11:57:18] <Cork> FrameFever: one sec let me test this, i might remember wrong
[11:57:22] <matteu1> notashrimp:  var childElem = something;  childElem.appendTo( parent).on( ...)
[11:57:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone familiar with datatables.net ?
[11:57:27] <lollypopgr> need help with something, I am newbie in jquery. Jquery is creating some input fields and I want to bind to them a calendar(Jquery UI). what can I do?
[11:57:42] <Cork> or rather i might be too sleepy an mix things up :)
[11:58:23] <versatiletech> matteu1: the problem is that you copied the function and when that function runs it needs to know what jQuery object use. "this" in all of the jQuery functions reference the jQuery object of DOM elements, but when you run writeFunction( message ), it doesn't know anything about "elem". You need to pass "elem" to writeFunction to substitute "this" for "elem": writeFunction.apply( elem, [message] ). http://jsbin.com/omukum/2/edit
[11:58:46] <notashrimp> matteu1: But can I chain it to something like $(".foo").show().find(".bar")
[11:59:06] <notashrimp> Like if I wanted to add a div to .bar and give it a click function or whatever
[11:59:21] <Cork> FrameFever: ya i remembered wrong, its http://jsfiddle.net/TfKzF/1/
[11:59:30] <Cork> and with that i'm gone o/
[11:59:36] <lollypopgr> Tried this but it didin't work -> http://jsbin.com/aluwiy/1/edit
[11:59:49] <FrameFever> ok
[12:00:22] <lollypopgr> Damn you jquery.

[12:01:18] <matteu1> versatiletech: that makes sense, thank you
[12:04:03] <notashrimp> Oh, I guess that does the trick. Would be nice if the append returned reference to the appended element, but I guess one variable doesn't hurt.

[12:24:04] <defaultro_> what would be the code for it?
[12:24:20] <diamonds> http://jsfiddle.net/sequoia/qw6mR/ updated
[12:24:22] <defaultro_> the $('<strong>).val() is not working for me
[12:24:36] <NoiseEee> defaultro_: .val() is for form elements.
[12:24:40] <defaultro_> oh
[12:24:45] <defaultro_> what should I use then?
[12:24:55] <NoiseEee> and anyways, your <strong> is closed immediately; your number isn't within <strong>
[12:25:09] <defaultro_> it's generated
[12:25:17] <NoiseEee> $('fieldset').text() should give you something like "Report ID: 11111 <etc>"
[12:25:30] <defaultro_> i can't use text?
[12:25:37] <defaultro_> oops, i mean strong?
[12:25:59] <NoiseEee> why would you?  what you've got posted is equivalent to <strong></strong>  There is nothing in the tag.
[12:26:36] <defaultro_> ah
[12:26:58] <defaultro_> it's really under fieldset then

[12:54:34] <scar> is there a way to monitor jquery arguments?
[12:54:41] <Eviltwin> What does that mean?
[12:54:46] <scar> create a "queue" if you will of ALL actions
[12:54:55] <rkgarcia> how destroy an element?
[12:55:00] <Eviltwin> We're going to say no
[12:55:03] <rkgarcia> in DOM an memory? :P
[12:55:08] <Eviltwin> rkgarcia: That question was answered
[12:55:19] <rkgarcia> where Eviltwin ?
[12:55:37] <Eviltwin> Oh, rather what you said was correct
[12:55:42] <Eviltwin> That's how you remove an element from the DOM
[12:55:56] <scar> Eviltwin lol
[12:55:58] <rkgarcia> from DOM you can use .remove but from memory?
[12:56:22] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ scar
[12:56:27] <NoiseEee> rkgarcia: just don't have any references to it held elsewhere.  are you really concerned about memory?
[12:56:29] <Eviltwin> UGh
[12:56:40] <HarryPitfall> tks jonclark
[12:57:09] <rkgarcia> NoiseEee, yeah, i work in a realtime app
[12:57:24] <rkgarcia> that append childs and remove
[12:57:38] <Eviltwin> JavaScript does not have explicit memory allocation and freeing
[12:57:41] <rmill> `api get
[12:57:56] <Eviltwin> That is done implicitly with garbage collection
[12:58:01] <NoiseEee> rkgarcia: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/864516/what-is-javascript-garbage-collection
[12:58:23] <Eviltwin> If you watn to "delete it from memory" remove it from the DOM and then clear any references you have to it
[12:59:05] <rkgarcia> for reference i undestarnd that is triggers
[12:59:07] <rkgarcia> ?
[13:00:16] <Eviltwin> var myelement = $("#myelement"); myelement.remove(); /* removed from DOM */; myelement = null; /* cleared this reference to myelement so the garbage collector now knows it can be freed */
[13:00:44] <Eviltwin> Or, written more succinctly, $("#myelement").remove();
[13:01:37] <dns-away> how
[13:02:25] <FrameFever> how can I insert a element to another element at a given index?
[13:02:34] <rkgarcia> i can use $(selector) = null; ?
[13:02:36] <dns-away> mouse
[13:02:43] <jonclark> FrameFever, assuming you know the index

[13:03:10] <dns-away> rhis s jqueru
[13:03:16] <dns-away> !

[13:06:24] * vinici away
[13:07:14] <Eviltwin> rkgarcia: Do you have any references to these elements in JavaScript?
[13:07:19] <Eviltwin> The ones you're trying to delete
[13:08:53] <rkgarcia> i have only elements that calls a functions
[13:09:04] <rkgarcia> like: view(id)

[13:35:25] <WebDragon> I see a LOT of different stuff on google
[13:36:03] <dns-away> ?
[13:36:08] <WebDragon> I'd been under the apparently mistaken impression (if all these articles are to be believed) that jquery had this sort of thing built in, but just hadn't used it/needed it yet, myself.
[13:36:08] <Brodingo> WebDragon respond js ?
[13:36:58] <Brodingo> supports min/max queries
[13:37:02] <WebDragon> this is my first foray into doing responsive design, so it's uncharted territory for me. people have obviously left a lot of signposts, but I still don't have this stuff in my head yet :)
[13:37:54] <WebDragon> Respond.js works by requesting a pristine copy of your CSS via AJAX, so if you host your css on other domains for whatever reason, it won't help you

[13:59:43] <shoky> don't see the need for === there ;p
[14:00:20] <gnarf> shoky: that should be "don't see the need for == there"

[14:01:48] <hugo_moss> if( !$(obj).is('#cnbt_accessories') ){ $(obj).remove(); }
[14:02:02] <gnarf> just always prefer === and !== except when you want ==

[14:02:37] <tehbaut> how might I return from the method of an object when inside of two $.each loops? http://pastebin.com/qxqp8rLK
[14:03:02] <rmill> tehbaut: You can use 'return' to break out of each() loops early.
[14:03:13] <shoky> return false
[14:03:19] <rmill> Ya, exactly.
[14:03:20] <NCS_One> on a JUI Button is it possible to disable a set of radio buttons?
[14:03:37] <tehbaut> rmill: well in my case, that's just returning from the function used for the $.each
[14:03:48] <gnarf> tehbaut: "return false" breaks an each
[14:03:51] <tehbaut> maybe it's because I'm using $.proxy too?
[14:04:09] <gnarf> return undefined doesn't do anything special
[14:04:28] <rmill> tehbaut: return false, and you need it in _both_ $.each tehbaut
[14:04:34] <rmill> that _should_ give you what you want.
[14:04:40] <gnarf> but
[14:04:43] <gnarf> why each anyway
[14:04:43] <rmill> oh wait, not both
[14:04:52] <tehbaut> I need to break from both nested $.each calls, as well as the method they're defined in, all at once. Otherwise, it will loop again with the outer $.each call
[14:04:53] <Eviltwin> Perhaps http://pastebin.com/nYA2Ccjq
[14:04:54] <gnarf> you really need the closures?
[14:05:40] <tehbaut> Eviltwin: that might work
[14:06:34] <mouses> whats better practice?  <span id="link-wrapper"><a id="next-photo"> &gt; </a></span>      or      <a id="next-link"><span id="link-display"> &gt; </span></a>

[14:09:18] <Darsain> what event on what element/object should I bind to get it fired on whenewer document is resized? $(window).on('resize') is not reliable, because apparently, turning on/off bookmarks bar in Chrome is not considered as a window resize, so nothing fires. and $(document).on('resize') does nothing...
[14:10:09] <Darsain> is there some mutation observer, or any other sorcery to handle this?
[14:10:17] <mouses> thx
[14:11:45] <MistuhKurtz> Darsain, $(window).on('resize');
[14:11:57] <MistuhKurtz> that must be a browser bug, because turning on/off dev tools in chrome fires it
[14:12:03] <MistuhKurtz> file a bug with chromium
[14:12:30] <MistuhKurtz> I don't think there's anything else you can do really, I'm afraid
[14:12:30] <Darsain> MistuhKurtz: well, thats what I'm asking. is there anything reliable? alternative?

[14:12:52] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[14:13:34] <MistuhKurtz> sounds like a quick fix once the bug has been filed so that they know about it
[14:14:41] <Darsain> I've filed one chrome bug, and I'm already sick of it. it is always preceded by hours of frustration trying to figgure shit out...

[14:17:19] <hugo_moss> it still enters the if statement, i checked the selector to make sure its not mistyped but its not

[14:21:54] <TelFiRE> Why are global functions a big no-no?
[14:25:04] <pehlert> TelFiRE: The pollute the namespace and may clash with other functions
[14:25:43] <pehlert> Remember the compiler is not gonna warn you about that!
[14:26:59] <TelFiRE> but performance
[14:27:21] <pehlert> If you can ensure that it's not going to clash, you could use them (e.g. when you name them telfire_project_myfunc). However, it's still a bad practice. Also makes it harder for you to figure out the actual purpose of the function when you read the source later
[14:28:08] <pehlert> TelFiRE: What project are you working on where that performance benefit (probably none at all for new compilers, a very slight benefit for older ones) will have an impact?
[14:29:47] <TelFiRE> I'm just wondering how it affects it
[14:29:54] <TelFiRE> trying to figure out the reasoning behind the best practice
[14:33:03] <pehlert> TelFiRE: I just told you. Otherwise Google will know
[14:48:26] <yango> are jquery plugins on topic? I upgraded dynatree to 1.2.2 and drag and drop stopped working. Anyone knows what needs to change?
[14:48:48] <yango> google hasn't helped me so far
[14:53:18] <sayd> does trigger/on work across different versions of jquery? if i bind in 1.44 and trigger in 1.71 for example
[15:01:43] <KWhat_Work> when you declare an object map, do functions get called?
[15:02:36] <KWhat_Work> Line 25 says widget is undefined:  http://pastebin.com/4x3HWBim
[15:02:42] <KWhat_Work> not 23, 25
[15:04:04] <KWhat_Work> and we play the waiting game
[15:09:00] <KWhat_Work> I fucking hate javascript
[15:14:02] <TrentonDAdams> hey guys.  I have a *wrapper* function to deal with my ajax calls.  I'm allowed to pass options to it, which get merged with my own defaults, and then passed to jQuery.ajax, and or called inside of the defaults.
[15:14:30] <TrentonDAdams> I'm having a problem where currentOptions.success.call(page, status, jqXHR) is passing undefined to the jqXHR parameter, and I can't figure out why.  Any ideas?
[15:14:40] <TrentonDAdams> As in generic ideas on why that might happen?
[15:24:01] <NexHD> hi
[15:24:59] <NexHD> how i put into if condition two variables with .test i mean regex , i have two  regex variables
[15:25:01] <NexHD> ?
[15:31:45] <shoky> >.>
[15:38:55] <mikeumus> Hey Gang, can you getScript like this?
[15:38:57] <mikeumus> <script id="jQui"> </script>');      $('#jQui').getScript("http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.1/jquery-ui.js");
[15:39:12] <mikeumus> it's giving me a object error
[16:08:56] <TelFiRE> is there a jquery version of on hash change that will work in ie7 by chance
[16:10:32] <Lucky--> TelFiRe: sammy
[16:10:36] <Lucky--> google uses it
[16:10:38] <Lucky--> gmail uses it
[16:11:41] <TelFiRE> Lucky--: sammy only claims to support IE8+
[16:12:02] <TelFiRE> and also I'm not really seeing anywhere in the page that I can find, how it solves this particular problem. I'm not questioning that it does, but it does a million other things
[16:14:15] <Lucky--> TelFiRE: http://sammyjs.org/docs/routes
[16:16:01] <TelFiRE> var current_hash = window.location.hash; -- this does exactly what I need, so I don't understand why I need a whole library for one line of raw JS
[16:16:05] <TelFiRE> it is an order of operations issue
[16:16:09] <Hapzz> $('form').submit(function() { return false });
[16:16:12] <Hapzz> why wont that work?
[16:16:26] <Lucky--> because you have to monitor the back event
[16:16:27] <Lucky--> history
[16:16:32] <Lucky--> backwards compatibility
[16:16:33] <Hapzz> what do you mean
[16:17:08] <TelFiRE> I don't care about the history. The way hash tags work by default is exactly what I want.
[16:24:25] <tw2113> how would I go about getting click events to be recognized by ajax-produced markup? my first hunch is something with bind()
[16:24:33] <tw2113> but i'm more than willing to be wrong
[16:25:59] <tw2113> or wrong about the whole thing, i'm noticing that the url is changing to hash anchors
[16:26:32] <shoky> markup doesn't generally recognize evens ;p
[16:26:33] <shoky> events
[16:26:51] <tw2113> well, i have links, and i have a class on them
[16:27:16] <tw2113> $('.slide-thumb').on('click',function(){ }); is changing the url, but not the contents
[16:27:34] <tw2113> including a .html() inside the click function
[16:27:40] <TelFiRE> tw2113: without too much info I would just guess that you have to do the click function or whatever function at a time when that has been produced. So at the end of the function that produces it or something
[16:27:41] <shoky> that will select all .slide-thumb elements at the time you run that line
[16:27:58] <shoky> you probably want event delegation?
[16:28:06] <tw2113> i'm half debugging half talking out loud
[16:28:29] <tw2113> i find it odd that preventDefault() is not occurring too
[16:28:57] <tw2113> i'll check on event delegation shoky
[16:28:58] <shoky> kinda hard to know what yer talking about ;p
[16:30:00] <shoky> but to handle events on ajax-produced markup, you'd need to either run that .on after the markup is already in the DOM,
[16:30:24] <shoky> or use event delegation, e.g.  $('#someContainer').on('click', '.slide-thumb', function() { ... })
[16:30:42] <tw2113> gotcha
[16:30:56] <tw2113> ?delegate
[16:31:03] <tw2113> boo bot
[16:31:19] <shoky> that's how you delegate ;p
[16:32:06] <tw2113> are you really going to argue against me trying to read the docs shoky?
[16:32:53] <shoky> just a bit ;>
[16:33:22] <tw2113> to be fair, i'm kind of glad i get to use delegate
[16:34:13] <shoky> as am i
[16:39:15] <tw2113> even better: $('#carousel,#thumbs').on('click', '.slide-thumb', function(e)
[17:05:59] <raj> hey shoky, wanna give me some advice?
[17:12:18] <tw2113> don't do drugs
[17:12:23] <tw2113> oops, i'm not shoky
[17:14:07] <raj> yeah, shoky would never say that
[17:16:00] <shoky> hey raj
[17:16:47] <shoky> do drugs
[17:21:16] <raj> haha
[17:21:17] <raj> nice
[17:21:22] <raj> I knew I could count on your advice
[17:22:33] <raj> shoky, I've got an html file with <script> tags pointing to .js files. I want to load each of these .js files using $.getScript('/path/from/head/script')
[17:24:20] <shoky> and?
[17:24:29] <raj> I have no idea how to do that
[17:24:55] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/evw23VN8BpcwF3ZGBKffpp
[17:24:57] <shoky> what does '/path/from/head/script' mean
[17:25:06] <shoky> er
[17:25:50] <raj> I wanna extract the paths in all the script tags and load them using $.getScript
[17:26:09] <shoky> from script tags that are already there and have already run..?
[17:26:28] <shoky> you want to re-run them?
[17:27:05] <raj> well, I'm loading a different html file (at least part of it) into the #content element of my current page
[17:27:30] <shoky> it's still part of the same original DOM
[17:27:40] <raj> it's not
[17:27:56] <shoky> #content is, i mean..
[17:27:59] <raj> oh, yes
[17:28:12] <shoky> well, that doesnt answer my question ;p
[17:28:39] <raj> I'm loading #content from the loaded html file
[17:28:52] <raj> and placing it into my current page's #content
[17:29:13] <shoky> yes
[17:29:27] <shoky> and you want to re-run the scripts?
[17:29:38] <raj> but the loaded html file's script tags and link (css) tags aren't loaded
[17:29:44] <raj> so yes, I want to re-run the scripts
[17:30:03] <raj> but it's really "run" instead of "re-run" since they never ran
[17:30:49] <shoky> gotcha, i originally thought the 'html file with <script> tags' was the original page
[17:31:01] <shoky> meh
[17:31:33] <shoky> umm, no idea about loading new stylesheets really
[17:31:49] <shoky> and for scripts, getScript no good?
[17:32:04] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/DwcJHV4t9aTc5JHQLaMAdK
[17:32:19] <shoky> umm or you want to actually parse the urls from the ajax response
[17:32:19] <raj> getScript only loads 1 script at a time, provided I provide the paths
[17:32:27] <raj> yes, exactly
[17:32:47] <shoky> i think you need a better way to do all this
[17:33:06] <shoky> loading full html pages with ajax is always too messy
[17:33:49] <raj> well, the other choice is .load()
[17:33:50] <shoky> either use an iframe, or structure everything so that your main page has already loaded (or knows how to load) the relevant scripts/css
[17:34:23] <raj> either way I need to .load() the html page so I can get the #content section of the retrieved page
[17:34:31] <shoky> donno how far .load() will get you..
[17:35:00] <raj> it just loads any html file into a an element on the current page
[17:35:14] <shoky> right, except for the 'just'
[17:35:43] <raj> what do you mean?
[17:36:20] <shoky> well, at least when you use a selector with .load  like #content, it wont run the scripts in the page i think
[17:37:06] <raj> right, either way nothing is running scripts
[17:37:10] <shoky> anyway, i donno much about loading full html pages with ajax, always seems too messy for me
[17:37:31] <raj> in my production environment, I'll have a combined script and combined css file (.min)
[17:37:43] <shoky> if i'm gonna load something with ajax, i want to say in the request what i'm loading, and have the server gimme just that
[17:38:42] <raj> interesting
[17:38:49] <raj> so anyway, this is a temporary solution just for development
[17:41:26] <raj> so how can I do it?
[17:42:52] <shoky> iframe?
[17:43:01] <black_warlock> hey peeps
[17:43:20] <black_warlock> who can tell me the name of this programm used to register desktop ?
[17:43:22] <black_warlock> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsDlP2rAlw
[17:43:53] <shoky> black_warlock: that's GIMP..
[17:44:01] <black_warlock> hell yes
[17:44:07] <black_warlock> i didnt remember the name dam
[17:44:09] <raj> what will an iframe do?
[17:44:09] <black_warlock> thanks :D
[17:44:24] <black_warlock> iframe load other pages inside a page
[17:44:34] <raj> why not jsut use regex to find the script tags and snatch the url and load those .js files using getScript?
[17:44:36] <black_warlock> into a frame :P
[17:44:52] <shoky> raj: if you feel like doing that, go for it..
[17:45:04] <raj> it's just for the dev environment
[17:45:11] <raj> cuz I don't wanna combine all my js files
[17:46:24] <shoky> shrugs
[17:46:25] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:46:38] <shoky> godamit
[17:46:42] <shoky> hm
[17:46:55] <shoky> retarded
[17:47:06] <shoky> y u so hm
[17:47:06] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[17:47:23] <raj> haha
[17:47:37] <shoky> ;D
[17:51:04] <raj> do you speak regex?
[17:51:27] <raj> :)
[17:53:53] <shoky> yea ;p
[17:54:01] <shoky> by no means a ninja tho
[17:54:42] <shoky> and parsing html properly is no fun at all
[17:54:52] <black_warlock> shoky not the programm for editing the programm to register dektop
[17:55:07] <shoky> black_warlock no idea what you're talking about
[17:55:22] <black_warlock> how that girl registered her video
[17:55:55] <shoky> uhh i don't speak italian sorry
[17:57:20] <hye> hi
[17:57:34] <hye> I currently have something like this $(".blah")  this essentially finds all classes of blah
[17:57:44] <hye> but I want to find all "blah" that contains a certain element
[17:57:45] <hye> how would i do that?
[17:58:07] <hye> i guess $(".blah input:checkbox")
[17:58:08] <hye> ill try that
[17:58:45] <shoky> hye: there's :has() selector and .has() method
[17:58:59] <hye> oh nice, let me check that out
[17:59:29] <hye> sweet shoky i wonder whats the performance difference
[17:59:34] <hye> i guess its probably better
[17:59:37] <hye> thanks
[17:59:44] <shoky> it's not a matter of performance difference
[17:59:52] <shoky> your selector would choose the checkboxes, not the .blah
[18:00:04] <black_warlock> the programm with that yellow cursor !
[18:00:10] <black_warlock> hell its famous
[18:00:19] <shoky> black_warlock: ask smth jquery kthx
[18:00:20] <black_warlock> shes registering with
[18:00:27] <hye> $(".blah:has(:checkbox)")  that would select the checkbox?
[18:00:39] <shoky> hye: no it would select the .blah
[18:00:41] <dblosevn> dos on a monochrom amber monitor? @ black
[18:00:48] <dblosevn> black_warlock
[18:01:01] <hye> so if i need to do a :has on multiple elements, do i just seperate by comma?
[18:01:12] <shoky> hye: that'd work
[18:01:17] <black_warlock> ??
[18:01:19] <hye> $(".blah:has(:checkbox,.siblingblah")
[18:01:25] <hye> ok thanks shoky let me give it a spin in the real world
[18:02:14] <black_warlock> what dblosevn ?
[18:03:03] <hye> shoky that worked great... saved me an extra selector of selecting back up to the parent :)
[18:08:13] <rgenito> hi everyone ;(
[18:08:38] <rgenito> so i'm going crazy trying to get this date picker to work.... any ideas what's missing?
[18:08:51] <rgenito> http://www.realtechusa.com/ ... it's the text input on the bottom right
[18:09:02] <raj> shoky, what do you mean "parsing html properly"?
[18:09:11] <raj> like using regex to go through the html?
[18:09:25] <raj> ajax is just returning the html file as text
[18:13:42] <rgenito> halllppp :(
[18:13:43] <rgenito> http://jsfiddle.net/5BVaG/
[18:13:47] <rgenito> can't get datepicker to work ;(
[18:14:23] <johnkpaul> rgenito: did you include jquery UI?
[18:16:05] <rgenito> johnkpaul, probably not =[ did you see the jsfiddle?
[18:16:37] <johnkpaul> rgenito: yes, I did, you're not including jQuery UI
[18:16:43] <johnkpaul> .datepicker() isn't part of jQuery itself
[18:16:45] <johnkpaul> it's part of jquery ui
[18:16:47] <johnkpaul> ?g jqueryui @rgenito
[18:16:47] <b-ot> rgenito, jQuery UI → http://jqueryui.com/
[18:17:51] <rgenito> johnkpaul, ah ok, since it wasn't an option on the dropdown menu as 'library' i figured i'd get away without it. guess not... ty :) i'll include it
[18:18:06] <johnkpaul> rgenito: :) np
[18:18:43] <rgenito> johnkpaul, hmm: http://jsfiddle.net/5BVaG/1/
[18:18:47] <rgenito> still doesn't work =[
[18:20:08] <johnkpaul> rgenito: you need more than just the script tag
[18:20:41] <johnkpaul> rgenito: http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#default
[18:20:46] <johnkpaul> click on "view source"
[18:21:01] <johnkpaul> you need those css files too
[18:21:27] <johnkpaul> rgenito: http://jsfiddle.net/g7Ah6/1/
[18:21:32] <rgenito> ahh i see
[18:22:29] <rgenito> so this basically isn't working because i dont have the style sheets included....
[18:25:41] <rgenito> johnkpaul, thanks for the jsfiddle, but i can see from their website that it works. i'm trying to get the datepicker to activate upon clicking something...like an image. (but i'm using a link in my jsfiddle example)
[18:25:55] <rgenito> WAIT
[18:26:00] <rgenito> @_@ their site has icon trigger! YES
[18:26:28] <johnkpaul> rgenito: great
[18:29:17] <rgenito> thanks :
[18:29:18] <rgenito> :D
[18:44:33] <tomasm-> hi, i'm trying to make sure a submit button can only be clicked once, by disabling it after it's clicked, but this seems to stop the event from firing and the form wont submit. any ideas? i have a problem where people are stupid enough to double click, then it acts odd
[18:50:14] <danheberden> tomasm- i'd do all that work on the form submit
[18:50:21] <danheberden> not on the click
[18:50:31] <danheberden> then not only prevent the form from submitting twice
[18:50:35] <danheberden> but also disable the button
[18:54:50] <GoSox> do you have to use the selector with an .on("click") call?
[18:55:02] <GoSox> that's already bound to an $("#id")
[18:55:07] <GoSox> so why have a selector too?
[19:00:38] <GoSox> i have a very simple on("click") attached to an image via it's ID but i can't seem to get any action from it.
[19:00:41] <GoSox> no errors in the console
[19:00:42] <GoSox> just nada
[19:15:54] <AlbinoGeek> Hi!
[19:16:29] <AlbinoGeek> Right so, I need to have a form with a file upload OR text field; which is going fine right now, but even after removing the other from the DOM (.remove()) it is submitted in the form.
[19:16:31] <AlbinoGeek> Any ideas what's going on?
[19:18:30] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: if you are truly removing it then it wouldn't be submitted, unless you are serializing the form and doing an AJAX call that gets the form data before removing the other field.
[19:19:10] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, What I've done is I've put a .click on the submit button (which I removed the type submit from.)  And I am manually using .submit after removing the fields.
[19:19:32] <MrPunkin> paste code?
[19:19:41] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Yeah, I'm pasting the submit hook now.
[19:20:12] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, http://hastebin.com/fatobabusi.js
[19:20:44] <AlbinoGeek> I put a breakpoint on submit and see the 'type'=="URL" and saw it remove both the image (upload field) and the html (textarea)
[19:21:10] <AlbinoGeek> However; 'data' is an empty string on the server, and nothing shows in the files postdata.
[19:22:05] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Looking in the POST data my browser sent, it looks like only one fields was removed; since I see two 'data' blocks.
[19:22:31] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: can you paste your sent data from the server too?
[19:24:03] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Well, here's the entire POST as my browser sent it: http://i.imgur.com/qJUra.png
[19:24:39] <AlbinoGeek> You can see a blank field 'data' seems to be there still, even though I've confirmed it was removed.
[19:25:08] <MrPunkin> how about your HTML? Have you tried giving them unique names just to test which one is actually submitting?
[19:26:14] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, I cannot, as the script receiving the values is of MVC type; the form itself is a Model (Yeah, I hate OOP web applications, makes all of this really complicated.)
[19:26:38] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, I've given them different names though for testing (model dies, but I get the postdata) and I can see that the textarea refuses to .remove()
[19:26:53] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: MVC should technically keep the form in the view portion anyways, but that's outside your control it seems.
[19:27:15] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, The form is in the view, but the model holds the data, and catche the data when the form is submitted.
[19:27:23] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, So I can add/remove fields, but they won't be caught.
[19:27:39] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: Right, I simply meant for testing purposes, not for actual change
[19:27:52] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: Can you paste the actual HTML too by chance?
[19:27:57] <MrPunkin> the rendered HTML with all fields
[19:28:07] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, I can give you the URI to the page (one better) if you'd like.
[19:28:31] <AlbinoGeek> Just give me a sec to disable login
[19:28:36] <AlbinoGeek> or well, make login always return true
[19:29:02] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, http://96.55.116.148:1337/manager/index.php/modules/update/1
[19:29:07] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Username: admin    any password
[19:29:57] <MrPunkin> okay, one sec
[19:30:18] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Thanks for trying to help, this has been blockading me for hours now.
[19:30:20] <snowfox_ben> Hey all, I need to check the value of an input and if it has a value set it's value to the value of a select option: http://jsfiddle.net/hLDSQ/
[19:30:58] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: you have a broken function
[19:31:02] <AlbinoGeek> snowfox_ben, You can simply set the name of the dropdown to amount .. the paypald donate button will take dots and you can simply strip the dollar sign using the "value"
[19:31:11] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Odd, no JS errors or anything, what's the problem?
[19:31:13] <MrPunkin> in line 127 function _spl you can't set default JS values in the function args
[19:31:22] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: throwing an error for me in Chrome
[19:31:36] <MrPunkin> function _spl(e, instant=false)
[19:31:38] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Oh, no defaults in chrome ?  Haha.
[19:31:47] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Odd, FF and IE let me do that X_X
[19:31:47] <MrPunkin> it's improper JS syntax
[19:31:59] <AlbinoGeek> Alright, what's the correct syntax for defualts / optional parameters ?
[19:32:07] <MrPunkin> you need to just expect it, and then set it in the function like var instant = instant || false;
[19:32:22] <AlbinoGeek> kk fixing
[19:32:45] <GoSox> i have this super basic on click handler that isn't working when you click. Am I missing something obvious here?
[19:32:46] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/vbuMbyP2
[19:32:49] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, So just function _spl(e, instant) {  ?
[19:32:54] <MrPunkin> yep
[19:33:02] <snowfox_ben> AlbinoGeek, not sure what you mean
[19:33:11] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, And instant will be null / undefined if it's not given?
[19:33:25] <rmill> GoSox: set up an actual working demo with jsfiddle
[19:33:31] <rmill> and the markup you're working with
[19:33:34] <MrPunkin> it will be undefined, so you need to set it somewhere if you don't want it to throw errors AlbinoGeek
[19:33:47] <MrPunkin> like 'var instant = instant || false;'
[19:34:03] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Can I do speed= (instant==undefined?500:0); ?
[19:34:06] <snowfox_ben> AlbinoGeek, the drop down works for the 25, 50, 100, I am trying to get the "Other" to work…hmm, but you did give me an idea
[19:34:40] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, ie: if instant is undefined, speed is 500; else 0.
[19:35:03] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: you could do speed = (typeof(instant) == 'undefined') ? 500 : 0;
[19:35:05] <MrPunkin> I believe
[19:35:12] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Fixed please refresh
[19:35:36] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: am I okay to post?
[19:35:36] <rmill> GoSox: works fine → http://jsfiddle.net/uFR2C/
[19:35:48] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Yeah, this is a testsite; you can upload and whatever just fine.
[19:37:39] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: http://cl.ly/KRog
[19:37:45] <MrPunkin> two fields with same name
[19:37:59] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Yeah, there are three fields with the same name.
[19:38:13] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, There's a textarea, an input text, and an input file.
[19:38:18] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: so the problem is that the remove isn't actually happening then as expected
[19:38:27] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, When you click submit, a JS function runs that .remove()s two of them (hopefully) then submits.
[19:38:31] <AlbinoGeek> But yeah.,.. you see it's not :(
[19:38:53] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: wait a sec. I'm not seeing you preventing the default submit action
[19:38:58] <AlbinoGeek> That screenshot though btw, is only of some div/spans
[19:39:10] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, The button is only a "button" ; not a submit.
[19:39:38] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, So no .preventDefault required; albeit I'll do it to test, but in testing before it didn't change anything.
[19:40:57] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: I just removed all event handlers from the button and clicking it still cause a submission
[19:40:58] <DeltaHeavy> When running my mouse over and off an element really fast that's suppost to slideToggle, sometimes it gets...reveresed. The dropbox will be visible when the mouse isn't on it, but will close up when you put the mouse over where it's suppost to open it. Anybody know how to fix this? My code is in the following pastebin: http://pastebin.com/5u9z7jN2
[19:41:24] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Hmm... odd; button shouldn't pull submit, I'll change it to a span then.
[19:41:44] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: You could simply monitor submit of the form and not care which button triggers it
[19:41:52] <MrPunkin> return false, change the fields, and then do the submit
[19:41:59] <MrPunkin> not return false, but prevent default
[19:42:00] <MrPunkin> sorry
[19:42:03] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Tried that; the data was serialized before the .submit was called on some browsers
[19:42:12] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Alright, try now; submit button is a span now.
[19:43:22] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: Try this instead… just as an idea
[19:44:15] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Which?
[19:44:31] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: Stop handling this at the submit / click, but set a listener for change on the select that disables the form fields rather than removes them.
[19:45:04] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: I'm not familiar enough with jQuery if the change will do what you want though. In Prototype you could assign observers that checked every millisecond regardless of user action for value changes
[19:45:12] <starsinmypockets> Is there some wierd issue with animate() in FF?
[19:45:20] <MrPunkin> you could try disabling instead of removing in your click handler too though
[19:45:30] <starsinmypockets> $('#jokes').css({'margin-top': -newJokeOffset});
[19:45:38] <starsinmypockets> ^^works fine
[19:45:39] <starsinmypockets> But
[19:45:54] <starsinmypockets> $('#jokes').animate({'margin-top': -newJokeOffset}, 600);
[19:46:03] <starsinmypockets> Doesn't work in FF (current)
[19:46:10] <starsinmypockets> Works in IE*!
[19:46:14] <starsinmypockets> IE8!*
[19:46:21] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: however… the input id="ytModules_data" that is hidden is ALWAYS submitting Modules[data], so you will always have 2 data fields.
[19:46:24] <MrPunkin> you don't remove that field
[19:46:29] <starsinmypockets> :/
[19:46:53] <MrPunkin> starsinmypockets: try -newJokeOffset+'px'
[19:47:02] <MrPunkin> just out of curiousity
[19:47:03] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Oh, there's a hidden field doing it... odd.  I'll go have a look
[19:47:19] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: that's what I was trying to show in my screenshot
[19:47:36] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: it has no class, and thus isn't removed with any of your actions
[19:48:28] <starsinmypockets> MrPunkin - nope :\
[19:48:30] <AlbinoGeek> Hmm...
[19:49:05] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, This is really odd since I never define a hidden field.
[19:49:13] <MrPunkin> starsinmypockets: try marginTop instead of 'margin-top'
[19:49:26] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, http://i.imgur.com/YbwTU.png
[19:49:37] <MrPunkin> starsinmypockets: also I have noticed browsers sometimes won't take into account specific margins individually if the base css is all margins
[19:49:40] <AlbinoGeek> I also can't find it in source view, is it being created by the DOM ?
[19:49:46] <AlbinoGeek> In the DOM** by some JS?
[19:50:38] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: I'm seeing it in source.  Line 72
[19:50:41] <MrPunkin> raw HTML source in Chrome
[19:50:44] <starsinmypockets> MrPunkin marginTop worked... wierd I didn't even know that was a css property!
[19:51:00] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, http://i.imgur.com/MmWjO.png  I don't even see it, or is that just my vision X_X
[19:51:07] <MrPunkin> starsinmypockets: most JS libraries use camel-case instead of hyphenation
[19:51:13] <MrPunkin> starsinmypockets: it's not a true css property
[19:51:19] <MrPunkin> its just the JS equivalent.
[19:51:23] <AlbinoGeek> Nevermind.. I see it
[19:51:28] <starsinmypockets> MrPunkin - thanks for the tip!
[19:51:28] <AlbinoGeek> JS is adding that.. ugh
[19:51:31] <MrPunkin> AlbinoGeek: tabs / linebreak issue
[19:51:35] <MrPunkin> no it's not
[19:51:38] <MrPunkin> JS isn't running in view source mode
[19:52:11] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, That's why I'm rather confused, I don't see that in view source; only in the DOM viewer (firebug)
[19:52:27] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Regardless, seems the solution is to run .remove on that ID?
[19:53:50] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Thanks, seem that fixed it now.
[19:53:56] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, I can't beleive I didn't see that.
[19:54:05] <AlbinoGeek> MrPunkin, Solution was just to call .remove on ytModules_data onLoad.
[19:54:16] <AlbinoGeek> Turns out my framework was adding that to fix the conflict of names.
[19:54:47] <AlbinoGeek> Now to see if this field also exists on actionCreate..
[19:55:25] <starsinmypockets> MrPunk - I guess it's a little confusing because, for example, I would expect to pass a literal css attribute to css: $('elem').css('margin-top', val); I guess I'd expect the syntax to apply to animate... thanks again
[19:55:47] <starsinmypockets> ^MrPunkin
[19:56:15] <MrPunkin> starsinmypockets: I think they do it that way to be sure that you are changing ANY margin-top even if your CSS doesn't have it set specifically as a single margin-top reference
[19:58:37] <iateadonut> is there something besides .bind so that when i call a function that reloads the span that has an action bound to it, i don't have to call .bind again?
[19:59:42] <mfoxdogg|work> iateadonut: on
[19:59:50] <starsinmypockets> MrPunkin - lol now it doesn't work in ie9
[20:00:29] <MrPunkin> starsinmypockets: haha, don't know then
[20:01:48] <MrPunkin> iateadonut: no, you will need to rebind
[20:02:00] <MrPunkin> iateadonut: you could replace child content if you don't want to do that though
[20:10:40] <iateadonut> suppose i have different usertypes, e.g. 1,2, and certain functions should be available if usertype >= 1, and certain available if usertype >= 2
[20:10:48] <iateadonut> usertype is a php session varaible
[20:11:11] <crankharder> what response codes does $.ajax interpret as an error?
[20:11:27] <iateadonut> in order to not show a function to other users, i just have to have   functions1.js   and functions2.js   and have the script run if the usertype coincides?
[20:11:32] <iateadonut> is that the only way to do it?
[20:11:39] <iateadonut> or can i do it within jquery/javascript?
[20:14:37] <MrPunkin> iateadonut: you could pass the user type into code with a global variable and test against that in JS to determine which to run
[20:17:46] <snowfox_ben> AlbinoGeek, did you have any clarification to my select/value question? I didn't understand what you were suggesting.
[20:19:59] <MrPunkin> snowfox_ben: he's gone, and solved it
[20:20:24] <snowfox_ben> How did he solve it? Didn't make sense to me
[20:20:46] <snowfox_ben> "set to …"???
[20:24:38] <snowfox_ben> MrPunkin ^ ?
[20:25:10] <MrPunkin> snowfox_ben: he was having issues removing duplicate form fields with the same name, so that only the one chosen by a select field was sent
[20:25:18] <MrPunkin> snowfox_ben: the problem was a hidden field he was missing
[20:25:23] <snowfox_ben> oh, nono
[20:25:31] <snowfox_ben> he tried to answer a question for me
[20:25:37] <MrPunkin> oh I have no clue, sorry
[20:25:39] <snowfox_ben> but it wasn't not clear
[20:25:43] <snowfox_ben> and left
[20:25:48] <snowfox_ben> rats, no worries.
[20:26:51] <MrPunkin> snowfox_ben: I can help
[20:26:53] <MrPunkin> what are you looking to do?
[20:27:40] <snowfox_ben> updating my fiddle link, sec
[20:29:13] <snowfox_ben> http://jsfiddle.net/hLDSQ/3/
[20:32:28] <snowfox_ben> ^ MrPunkin
[20:33:04] <MrPunkin> snowfox_ben: so what is expectd result?
[20:33:13] <snowfox_ben> What I am trying to is…if they select Other, they fill out the text field
[20:33:25] <snowfox_ben> I take that value, and on submit, drop it into the amount
[20:33:46] <snowfox_ben> Sorry, I forgot you didn't see the first time I explained it- my apologies
[20:34:18] <otherj> join #rubyonrails
[20:34:22] <otherj> heh
[20:35:10] <MrPunkin> why?
[20:35:12] <MrPunkin> I'm there all the time
[20:35:40] <otherj> have it your way MrPunkin :(
[20:36:12] <MrPunkin> snowfox_ben: I would first make your drop down a different name than amount… since that is your hidden fields name too
[20:36:25] <MrPunkin> otherj: I'm a rails dev, hence being in there most the day
[20:36:35] <MrPunkin> otherj: what's your preferred language?
[20:36:52] <otherj> i actually just forgot my /
[20:37:02] <otherj> i guess i use a lot of ruby right now
[20:37:12] <snowfox_ben> Opps, that was an oversight…let me clean that up
[20:37:31] <otherj> trying to remember js / jquery stuff too
[20:37:51] <otherj> like, i can't even remember how to surpress the default click stuff for .toggle
[20:37:53] <otherj> pretty bad
[20:38:39] <Cork> otherj: .toggle isn't an event listener, so it doesn't have a default click
[20:39:22] <otherj> Cork, hm, ok. maybe i should just use <button> for that then
[20:39:24] <snowfox_ben> http://jsfiddle.net/hLDSQ/5/
[20:39:46] <Cork> otherj: do you have the code you have problems with?
[20:39:58] <Cork> (on an accessable link that is)
[20:40:20] <otherj> sure, one second. i mean, it's _very_ simple
[20:41:13] <Cork> otherj: opps sorry, i forgot the binder
[20:41:25] <Cork> (damn jquery with all its overloaded functions >_<' )
[20:42:37] <otherj> https://gist.github.com/8ed61cebe3fa7f557d56
[20:42:42] <rakl> does js or jquery have a built in way to print a selected dom element?
[20:42:54] <otherj> the toggle works, it's just that the browser goes to the top of the screen because it's trying to open #
[20:43:14] <Cork> rakl: console.log($('<div/>').html($(elm).clone()).html())
[20:43:16] <otherj> i tried to remove the click attr on the button, but no good
[20:43:33] <rakl> Cork I mean print to a printer
[20:43:38] <Cork> lol
[20:43:40] <Cork> ah, no
[20:43:43] <rakl> old school
[20:43:51] <Cork> you have to create a webpage and print that
[20:44:07] <Cork> otherj: so its the live click you want to suppress?
[20:44:08] <rakl> what do I even google to figure out how to do that?
[20:44:20] <Cork> otherj: e.preventDefault();
[20:44:38] <otherj> yeah, unless there's a better way to do what i'm doing
[20:44:47] <otherj> i imagine one can probably mke that less redundant, but ehhh
[20:44:52] <otherj> maybe selecting a class rather than ids
[20:45:03] <MrPunkin> snowfox_ben: I'd try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/hLDSQ/7/
[20:45:13] <Cork> otherj: btw, you should stop using .live, its depricated
[20:45:17] <otherj> Cork:  $("#addshipmentbutton").e.preventDefault(); ?
[20:45:23] <Cork> *deprecated
[20:45:24] <otherj> Cork, what's replacing it?
[20:45:33] <Cork> .delegate or .on
[20:45:42] <Cork> on $(document).
[20:45:47] <MrPunkin> snowfox_ben: that doesn't watch for the 'other' thing though
[20:46:11] <Cork> otherj: no e is a argument from your function callback
[20:46:17] <Cork> function(e) <--
[20:46:21] <otherj> oh
[20:46:56] <otherj> is .live depreciated in the new "break with the past" jquery versions?
[20:47:16] <snowfox_ben> hmm, watching the other is a key component, MrPunkin, but lemme look at this a bit
[20:47:17] <Cork> otherj: so $("#addshipmentsbutton").live("click", function) becomes $(document).on('click', "#addshipmentsbutton", function) or $(document).delegate("#addshipmentsbutton", 'click', function)
[20:47:30] <MrPunkin> snowfox_ben: I just didn't code that portion in just yet
[20:47:38] <Cork> otherj: yes, but its somewhere in the future
[20:47:48] <Cork> otherj: deprecated means its about to be removed
[20:48:10] <otherj> good to know. thanks Cork
[20:48:20] <Cork> otherj: AND live is a really bad implementation
[20:48:28] <Cork> thats why its deprecated
[20:49:11] <Cork> (if your unlucky it can cause a lot of extra work for the browser)
[20:49:17] <Cork> *you're
[20:50:11] <Cork> ?.jQPrint @ rakl
[20:50:15] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".jQPrint" in jQuery Docs.

[20:50:20] <bot-t> rakl, jQPrint - jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jqPrint
[20:50:42] <snowfox_ben> MrPunkin, it seems like my biggest problem is not being able to correct target the .amount select
[20:51:59] <adavia> is it possible to submit 2 forms with one submit button?
[20:52:19] <Cork> through js, yes, native html, no
[20:53:01] <Cork> $('#button').click(function() { $('#form1, #form2').submit(); });
[20:53:10] <adavia> i see
[20:53:36] <adavia> Cork:  both should be in the same page right?
[20:53:45] <Cork> $('#form1').submit(function() { $('#form2').submit(); }); if you prefer that
[20:53:56] <Cork> adavia: that would help ya :)
[20:54:04] <GoSox> are you "not allowed" to .slideUp() a div that is the container for a google api map?
[20:54:06] <Cork> else its hard for js to find it
[20:54:31] <Cork> GoSox: set position: relative; on the container
[20:54:42] <adavia> i see.. ill try that out
[20:54:47] <GoSox> what does that do?
[20:54:58] <Cork> makes the div an offset parent
[20:55:17] <Cork> if that doens't help check if they enforce any form of css rules
[20:55:21] <Cork> (inspect the dom)
[20:55:34] <GoSox> yeah that didn't help
[20:55:53] <Cork> another alternative might be to add an addition container around it
[20:58:20] <snowfox_ben> GoSox does it work with toggle() - as in, you think it is an issue with slideUp() specifically?
[20:58:21] <adavia> also another thing.. whenever i press enter to the selected autocomplete item i want it to show inside a div.. what im missing here http://jsfiddle.net/Nxqkc/ ?
[20:59:16] <GoSox> its working now, something unrelated was i guess halting my script
[20:59:37] <snowfox_ben> cool
[20:59:40] <GoSox> which leads me back to my initial problem… sliding the google map up and down (which works now) is changing the map content of the map
[20:59:44] <GoSox> and giving me grey space
[21:24:16] <GoSox> grrrrr i am having nothing but problems getting this stupid google map to work properly, and google's api page is not helping me at all
[21:26:09] <snowfox_ben> Alright, I am still stuck. On hour three of this...
[21:27:03] <snowfox_ben> To recap, I have an input that I want to update the value of a select, when the form is submitted.
[21:27:42] <snowfox_ben> http://jsfiddle.net/hLDSQ/10/
[21:38:12] <GoSox> every time i change something trying fix this map bug, my map will center in on a completely different area of town
[21:38:18] <GoSox> this is pissing me off oh so much
[21:40:06] <zeroquake> wat is the issue ?
[21:41:11] <GoSox> when i slideUp() and slideDown() the map div, the contents of the map get messed up, and the map is not centered on the coordinates it should be
[21:41:44] <Cork> GoSox: you prob don't want to modify the map container
[21:42:02] <Cork> keep it static, and do your stuff on a separate element you wrap it in
[21:42:32] <Cork> that way you won't mess with what the js assumes
[21:42:34] <GoSox> the map div's height is still going to change as it's container changes, i don't think that's going to have any effect on the problem i'm having
[21:43:02] <Cork> why should the container change if you keep its height static?
[21:43:11] <GoSox> slideUp()
[21:43:14] <GoSox> slideDown()
[21:43:55] <Cork> <div class="my-animation-element"><div id="map-container">...</div></div> $('my-animation-element').slideUp();
[21:43:59] <Cork> <div class="my-animation-element"><div id="map-container">...</div></div>
[21:44:03] <Cork> $('.my-animation-element').slideUp();
[21:44:17] <Cork> GoSox: make sure that the container the api uses NEVER change height
[21:44:33] <Cork> its quite simple to do
[21:48:56] <GoSox> nope
[21:49:01] <GoSox> that solved the first half of the problem
[21:49:03] <GoSox> but not the second
[21:49:11] <Cork> and the second is?
[21:49:18] <GoSox> which is that after i hide the map and then show it, its no longer centered properly
[21:49:28] <GoSox> it appears that the center point is now the top left corner
[21:49:40] <Cork> then you're still modifying the height on the original element
[21:49:57] <Cork> else it wouldn't know about you doing the animation
[21:50:15] <GoSox> i'm using slideUp and slideDown on a div that is the parent of the map div
[21:50:47] <Cork> GoSox: make sure you have a fixed height on the container element, and so on so it doesn't depend on the parent
[21:51:13] <GoSox> you mean the actual map div? it does have a fixed height
[21:51:30] <GoSox> the page is live if you want to see the whole thing
[21:51:36] <Cork> and position: relative; and overflow: hidden; ?
[21:51:42] <Cork> sure
[21:51:47] <GoSox> http://www.menulizard.com/by-nearby/
[21:52:04] <GoSox> if you're not on a laptop, it might not work well enough to even debug
[21:52:25] <Cork> heh, then ya...
[21:52:32] <Cork> i only get a throbber
[21:52:36] <zeroquake> anybody worked with pdf.js ??
[21:52:55] <Cork> zeroquake: a bit, but i don't know too much about it
[21:53:13] <Cork> (too much intimate details)
[21:53:23] <GoSox> Cork: did you maybe miss the browser asking for your permission to share your location?
[21:53:29] <GoSox> you shouldn't get the "throbber" for very long
[21:53:36] <Cork> GoSox: i have no location to share
[21:53:49] <GoSox> in that case, you should get a message saying that
[21:53:54] <GoSox> it should never just hang forever
[21:54:04] <zeroquake> is it possible to implemnt a front page with pdf files shown and when clicked it display the pdf using pdf.js , cant figure out where to start from
[21:54:27] <Cork> zeroquake: yes, it is
[21:54:44] <Cork> there site even have an example of that
[21:55:03] <zeroquake> they have an example showing a single pdf ,
[21:56:00] <zeroquake> kinda newbie in jquery , what do i look at to add a back button to go the pdf file list
[21:56:08] <Cork> yup thats the example i was talking about
[21:57:28] <zeroquake> this looks so cool, check it out http://cjcliffe.github.com/CubicVR.js/cubicvr/samples/pdf/pdf_gallery.html
[21:59:27] <Cork> zeroquake: its the built in viewer in newer firefox versions
[21:59:34] <Cork> thats why it was created
[22:00:20] <Cork> zeroquake: http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/web/viewer.html should give you all you need
[22:00:34] <zeroquake> yup going thru dat
[22:00:36] <Cork> check the viewer.js file
[22:01:10] <Cork> all you need to have is a file that loads the js files, and get the pdf from either the server script or through parsing the url
[22:02:29] <zeroquake> im gona try , understand how that can be done
[22:02:48] <Cork> its not that hard
[22:02:55] <Cork> parsing the pdf in js is the hard part :)
[22:03:03] <Cork> the rest is quite simple
[22:03:34] <Cork> (well embeded fonts was another big hurdle)
[22:04:59] <zeroquake> parsing is done by the pdf.js file ryt? i jus need to figure out how to call the pdf.js file when a pdf file is clicked no ? don mind if i sound stupid :P
[22:05:33] <Cork> yes
[22:05:56] <Cork> you need to load a html file with the scripts, then initiate pdf.js with the source pdf
[22:06:09] <Cork> the rest happens in js
[22:06:23] <Cork> (well js + canvas)
[22:07:47] <zeroquake> this is exactly what i am looking for -- without the indexeddb offline thingy

[22:16:00] <AndChat|> I think I have found a bug in ie10 metro pre-release that affects jquery. I am pretty sure it is a simple fix too. Anyone here with the IE10 release version able to test a jsbin page to check bug isn't just in pre-release?

[22:21:55] <zeroquake> cork -- any hints on how to pass the file name to a variable in the viewer.js file
[22:21:55] <zeroquake> ?
[22:22:24] <Cork> zeroquake: you don't you set the variable in the html file instead
[22:22:34] <morris> Bug in 1.8.2 offset method... http://jsbin.com/arerik/1
[22:22:53] <zeroquake> i see a variable by the name kdefaulturl in viewer.js
[22:24:55] <Cork> ya, you just move that outside the js file and put it before it in the header
[22:25:14] <Cork> (or you reimplement viewer.js file, its just a demo file anyway)
[22:26:38] <morris> Lol - I guess asking for IE8 release users here is a bit hopeful :-)
[22:27:15] <morris> s/IE8/IE10/
[22:29:09] <zeroquake> no idea how to implement that
[22:38:32] <morris> Will ask again later. Cheers :'(
