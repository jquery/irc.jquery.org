[00:00:41] <Es0teric> prodn, either… stopPropagation(); or preventDefault();
[00:00:42] <kakeman> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[00:00:58] <kakeman> check out that example
[00:01:14] <Es0teric> kakeman, wouldnt "return false" at the end
[00:01:16] <Es0teric> work too?
[00:02:12] <Es0teric> like… $('#div').click(function() { return false; });
[00:02:35] <user__> is anybody familiar with the BBQ Jquery plugin by Ben Alman? Im looking for a developer to integrate it with my website, will pay them obviously.
[00:02:46] <kakeman> Es0teric: i haven't tried
[00:03:02] <kakeman> i use preventDefault as it works
[00:03:02] <Es0teric> kakeman, that should work too..
[00:06:11] <kakeman> i'm totally beginner
[00:06:42] <kakeman> don't know tricks

[00:08:42] <sviatovigt> hi
[00:09:41] <sviatovigt> I receive the error "invalid assignment left hand side" upon issuing this command blockPersonalSection.find('#title').html() = $("#first-name").val() + " " + $("#last-name").val();
[00:10:05] <sviatovigt> where blockPersonalSection is a variable that holds a detach div
[00:10:06] <Whirl3d> EsOteric, I'd have EvilTwin look at it for you. He could probably make your code work in 2 lines of jquery.
[00:10:57] <Es0teric> lol alright Whirl3d.. thanks
[00:11:14] <Eviltwin> That's why I have this: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[00:11:42] <Es0teric> yeah… im broke so… lol

[00:13:25] <Es0teric> Eviltwin, i am using a combination of…… replaceWith() and keypress conditionals
[00:13:37] <sviatovigt> ok
[00:13:43] <sviatovigt> thank you
[00:13:43] <Es0teric> oh, nvm
[00:13:44] <Es0teric> >.>
[00:13:47] <sviatovigt> I think I got it
[00:14:07] <Eviltwin> Es0teric: Do you have a jsFiddle?
[00:14:30] <Es0teric> yezzir, eviltwin -> http://jsfiddle.net/seBfE/10/
[00:14:55] <Eviltwin> What's the goal?
[00:15:49] <Es0teric> well, i want to be able to insert text into the input field(of course) and i want it to change to the <b> tag once the enter key is pressed… and also to cancel the backspace from going to the previous page when in the input field
[00:16:35] <Es0teric> Eviltwin, because of course - if someone wants to delete text from the input field, they wouldnt want it going back a page lol
[00:17:56] <Eviltwin> So you want the <p> tags to become <input>s to edit the HTML and then switch back?
[00:18:15] <Es0teric> eviltwin, yes pretty much..
[00:18:59] <Es0teric> eviltwin, not the <p> tags the <b> tags
[00:19:03] <g[r]eek> Hi I'm using .load(uri, data) to do some Ajax. The data being sent is in JSON format. The target script is PHP. I heard I can automagically make the JSON data be interepreted in $_POST in the PHP script. How do I do this?
[00:19:45] <Whirl3d> Esoteric, why not just have the <b> tags be styled input element that when focused get a new style?
[00:20:18] <Whirl3d> EsOteric, then just handle keypress events on focus
[00:21:27] <Es0teric> Whirl3d, could you repeat that in a different way?
[00:23:23] <Eviltwin> Es0teric: So something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/seBfE/12/
[00:23:32] <Eviltwin> Oh
[00:23:48] <Eviltwin> Well that's at least a starting point for you
[00:24:14] <Es0teric> you created a function, eviltwin
[00:25:18] <Eviltwin> Your powers of observation continue to serve you well
[00:26:38] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/seBfE/16/
[00:26:47] <Es0teric> eviltwin your sarcasm is funny
[00:27:01] <poppiez> is it possible to get the request headers before doing the ajax call?
[00:27:59] <Eviltwin> poppiez: ?
[00:28:42] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: I would probably avoid that solution
[00:28:52] <Whirl3d> Cool, why is that?
[00:29:05] <poppiez> Eviltwin: I need to know what info I'm sending in the headers to the server
[00:29:33] <Eviltwin> Content-editable is still a little quirky depending on the browser and limits what you can edit
[00:29:52] <Eviltwin> Like adding a strike through or something
[00:30:36] <Es0teric> Whirl3d, what is keycode 15?
[00:32:13] <Es0teric> ok, Whirl3d, now i get what you did.. you made an input field instead of a <b> tag
[00:33:08] <Whirl3d> yeah, then when it is receiving keypress events, just check if enter, tab, or backspace are pressed and do something if they are.
[00:34:14] <Whirl3d> I think some browsers will automatically replace <b> tags with <emph>  or something. Or maybe that was just a plugin for a browster that did that. I have just always been told to avoid the <b> tag. dunno why for sure
[00:34:53] <MACscr> how should i know if i can put a call to jquery plugin in the footer versus the header of a page?
[00:35:31] <Whirl3d> EvilTwin, content-editable? I just chose .editable as my class name, I guess Content-Editable is an HTML5  attribute or something?
[00:36:04] <Es0teric> Whirl3d, i think it is
[00:36:14] <Cork> it isn't
[00:36:21] <Cork> ?mdc contentEditable
[00:36:31] <bot-t1> Cork, Element.contentEditable - MDN - contentEditable is used to indicate whether or not the element is editable. This enumerated attribute can have the following values: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Element.contentEditable
[00:36:34] <thomedy> i have to apologize i cant remember how to cause a div to scroll i have done it before... but i cant remember.. i am doing $('div.class').scrollTo(x) and the div.class position is relative
[00:36:37] <thomedy> what am i missing
[00:37:25] <Whirl3d> lol, wasn't aware of that. Thanks Cork, Eviltwin...always someting new to learn.
[00:37:29] <Cork> Whirl3d, Es0teric: it was introduced by ie way way back, netscape followed, and all browsers has supported it for yeard
[00:37:40] <Cork> *years
[00:37:51] <Cork> not sure if its part of any spec though
[00:38:12] * Whirl3d still can't tie his own shoes
[00:38:49] <Es0teric> cork, what about - http://html5demos.com/contenteditable
[00:39:04] <Whirl3d> thomedy, isn't scrollTo a plugin for jquery?
[00:39:10] <Whirl3d> ?.scrollTo
[00:39:13] <bot-t1> Whirl3d, plugins.jquery.com - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[00:39:16] <thomedy> okayi also tried scrollTop
[00:39:32] <Cork> Whirl3d: "html5" is mostly a hype word now days
[00:39:35] <thomedy> but it may have been my fault cuz thats what google sent me to i thought i remmbered it
[00:39:40] <thomedy> any suggestions
[00:40:04] <Whirl3d> $("div.class").animate({scrollTop:num},3000);
[00:40:11] <Cork> Whirl3d: it includes every thing from new javascript support to speed tests to html tags to css3 preliminary options
[00:41:01] <dr1337> hey guys, qucik question
[00:41:03] <thomedy> okay and then its .stop().animate to go one bit at a time right cuz stop breaks the animation
[00:41:06] <thomedy> thank you
[00:41:21] <dr1337> how do i use fade on an object's css background?
[00:41:36] <dr1337> without fading out its child elements
[00:41:47] <Cork> Whirl3d: it went as far that the workging group renamed the html standard
[00:41:47] <Cork> s/as far/so far/
[00:41:54] <Whirl3d> you use .stop(). before .animate() to ensure that you don't queue up a bunch of unfinished animations in the "fx" queue for an object
[00:42:16] <Cork> dr1337: you can't really do that
[00:42:20] <thomedy> okay its been a  bit but let me try that out and then hit you back if necessary thank you
[00:42:37] <dr1337> Cork: is there an alternative solution to using css3 transitions?
[00:42:41] <Cork> dr1337: you need to use a secondary element to fade just the background
[00:42:41] <Whirl3d> Cork, you always have great extra information about a topic, thanks...
[00:43:10] <Cork> Whirl3d: well i've been fiddeling with it for 15+ years, it should show a little bit :)
[00:43:27] <dr1337> Cork: how would I set that element to be at the lowest level of the view heirarchy?
[00:43:53] <Cork> dr1337: you set position relative/on the element that should be above
[00:44:03] <Cork> and zindex= 2(or higher)
[00:44:06] <dr1337> alright thanks
[00:44:56] <Cork> bah, i meant "position relative/absolute on"
[00:47:42] <mindis|wurk> hmmh. i wonder if it's possible to tell the broswer not to use a cached page when loading an iframes content
[00:47:54] <Cork> sure
[00:48:07] <Cork> just add a date string as a param
[00:48:27] <mindis|wurk> or maybe a random number so that's different every time
[00:48:29] <Zogot> you should also be able to specify no cache in the header of the file
[00:48:41] <Zogot> If im understanding you correctly
[00:48:45] <Cork> mindis|wurk 'domain.tld/url/site.html?' + Date.now()
[00:49:02] <Cork> mindis|wurk: you can't get much more random then the unix time
[00:49:12] <Cork> unless you reload several times a second :)
[00:49:43] <mindis|wurk> oh right it returned unix time. thanks, that'll do
[00:50:14] <Cork> well correction its not random, but its garanteed uniq :)
[00:58:25] <g[r]eek> Can a call to $.post(uri, date, function(data){...}, "json") return any data type or must the returned data also be json? Because for some reason my $.post(...) isn't returning any data
[00:58:46] <g[r]eek> well let me rephrase, the function isn't being executed. Not sure how to debug it. Any tips ?
[00:59:39] <g[r]eek> $.post("/example.php", {"Name": "John"}, function(data) { alert("hello"); }, "json");  <-- the alert isn't showing up
[01:01:01] <kakeman> add this after it
[01:01:03] <kakeman>     .complete(function() { alert("complete"); });
[01:01:29] <g[r]eek> as in... }, "json").complete(function() { alert("complete"); });   ??
[01:02:03] <g[r]eek> kakeman, yeah it's showing the complete alert
[01:02:44] <kakeman> then you know it executes
[01:02:47] <kakeman> but no success
[01:02:49] <g[r]eek> kakeman, ok I dropped the "json" bit and now it's fine
[01:02:56] <g[r]eek> why would that be?
[01:03:22] <g[r]eek> should I first stringify the data before sending it
[01:05:52] <kakeman> put it like this: Name : "John"
[01:22:56] <imc> hello, i'm quite new to javascript / jquery (i.e. had to modify/add features but never wrote something from scratch) and I would like to ask 1) good 'cheatsheet' of common patterns / best practices in javascript and/or jQuery; and 2) how should I interpret a `this.each(function() { ... });' inside a $.fn.something = function() { ... } ?
[01:24:01] <thomedy> okay i dont know what my prob is im going to do a js fiddle and then you guys tell me why im stupid
[01:24:25] <imc> 'cause I read that .each() "iterates over the DOM elements that are pare of the jQuery object" but I really can't see what DOM object are in question
[01:24:32] <imc> *part
[01:29:44] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ imc
[01:29:45] <bot-t1> imc, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[01:30:04] <imc> thanks Eviltwin
[01:35:46] <Whirl3d> Using $.data on a DOM element instead of calling $.fn.data on a jQuery selection can be up to 10 times faster.
[01:35:52] <Whirl3d> wow, didn't know that
[01:37:31] <thomedy> okay so i have $('div.class').animate({scrollTop: 'x'}, 3000);
[01:37:44] <thomedy> why isn't my div scrolling... ihave the position at relative;
[01:38:02] <AdvoWork> if aData = ,16598,test,01-02-2012,<img src='  how can i get the 16598?
[01:38:37] <Whirl3d> aData.split(",")[1];
[01:40:15] <Whirl3d> thomedy, I have spent a great deal of time (and I mean a GREAT DEAL of time) trying to get a solid grasp on the scrolling thing and the ONE thing that I am certain about is that it is just best to use Ariel Fleischer's ScrollTo plugin for scrolling.
[01:40:21] <Stupidguy> hey! Could I get some advice on how to play wav-files with Javascript? I looked at the audio-tag in HTML5, but IE doesn't support *.wav
[01:40:32] <Stupidguy> do you need a plugin ?
[01:40:44] <Whirl3d> I don't like to rely on 3rd party plugins, but scrolling is just a pain in the ass to get even close.
[01:40:49] <thomedy> i have actually done scrolling myself i just  havent done it in a while
[01:41:02] <thomedy> i dont know why i cant figure this out at all
[01:41:09] <thomedy> wait i just thought of somethign
[01:41:16] <Whirl3d> did you put up a fiddle
[01:42:33] <Whirl3d> Stupidguy, never really heard of anyone using jquery for audio...it may exist and people may use it regularly, but I've never heard of it. Sorry.
[01:43:02] <Stupidguy> alright, thanks for answering
[01:50:06] <teeher> http://floreus.com.au/buy-now/ <- how would I get it to add all the values of the checkboxes instead of .length
[01:50:14] <teeher> I am trying to get the total amount
[01:53:05] <Whirl3d> teeher, imo, I would setup a table for tabular data like that. Then you could easily add up the values. Right now, your "simulated" table is a mess of spans and some clever spacing in the value attribute of your checkbox field...blech!
[01:58:11] <jay5> Hello I am updating HTML of a DIV inside The Dilaog div using ajax but it shows up on the main page and not on the dialog using Jquery UI 1.8.1
[01:58:59] <Zogot> I've never really used jquery UI before, what causes this..? http://rowland.nl/client/agendas
[02:00:23] <jay5> I cant figure it out
[02:01:11] <Zogot> Might need a demo, or a screenshot or so jay5.  it doesn't say much, what you wrote.
[02:01:43] <jay5> will do a demo in jsfiddle
[02:01:50] <thomedy> now im really confused i looked aat some of my old code and its the same as what im doing now
[02:01:56] <thomedy> id ont know why this isn't working at all
[02:07:28] <AdvoWork> Whirl3d, i tried alert("1st:"+ aData.split(",")[1] );  and it says: Uncaught TypeError: Object ,16598,,test,01-02-2  has no method 'split'
[02:17:43] <Whirl3d> advoWork, where did you get the object?
[02:18:03] <jay5> this will give you an idea but its not working http://jsfiddle.net/SfSsC/
[02:19:52] <jay5> On jsfiddle you see I have a div with Id 'dialog' and second div with id 'one'
[02:20:54] <jay5> Now i make a Jquery Ui dialog out of <div id="dialig"> and hide the <div="one">
[02:20:57] <AdvoWork> Whirl3d, its "fnRowCallback": function( nRow, aData, iDisplayIndex ) {
[02:22:08] <AdvoWork> Whirl3d, code is http://pastebin.com/MD57jsM8
[02:22:51] <jay5> there is button called 'click if I click this the html of <div id='one'> is changed and it is  shown
[02:23:15] <jay5> but it will show up on the page behind the dialog and not on the dialog
[02:23:40] <jay5> Zogot , here is the link http://jsfiddle.net/SfSsC/
[02:23:52] <Whirl3d> what are you passing to the fnRowCallback function?
[02:25:07] <Wiz_KeeD> what is the best lightweight mobile library?
[02:25:19] <Wiz_KeeD> i was thinking of using html 5 as well so i can keep data even without internet connection
[02:28:05] <AdvoWork> Whirl3d, description is: This function allows you to 'post process' each row after it have been generated for each table draw, but before it is rendered on screen. This function might be used for setting the row class name etc.    and im not passing anything, thats just getting the adata where adata is the json returned by my code
[02:28:31] <someprimetime> jsfiddle going slow for anyone else?
[02:29:09] <larsemil> someprimetime: fast and nice here.
[02:29:14] <someprimetime> :(
[02:29:40] <Whirl3d> Advowork, Ihave no way to help you with that. What you are asking is for someone to understand your entire architecture without disclosing anything but a couple of function names and some gibberish. Sorry, good luck with that
[02:30:06] <XeruX> I have a list of users, and when I click on the user I'd like a box to appear right under the user with textboxes and whatnot for editing. Is there any plugin that can do this for me? Also, the box should have like a small triangle pointing to the user, like a tooltip or whatever
[02:30:52] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, every morning around this time, jsfiddle starts to crawl for me. I'm in ATL, US
[02:31:40] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: ah, i'm in CA myself. i was just thinking earlier that i would definitely pay a membership if it allowed me consistent uptime
[02:31:57] <someprimetime> i was in georgia over the summer, up in woodstock/roswell area
[02:31:58] <Whirl3d> that and line numbers
[02:32:06] <someprimetime> yeah line numbers would be cool
[02:32:08] <someprimetime> and html formatting
[02:32:32] <Whirl3d> and hourly foot massages, but I'm not asking much...
[02:32:35] <someprimetime> well, the tidyup function for html formatting that is
[02:32:37] <Whirl3d> lol
[02:32:39] <someprimetime> haha word
[02:32:53] <someprimetime> hourly foot massages by Eviltwin and ajpiano

[02:34:57] <dareign85> is there some easy way to dyamically create a form and submit it?
[02:35:18] <Raydiation> how can i slide an element from right to left instead from left to right with jquery ui toggle?
[02:35:26] <Zogot> anyway you can specify a certain class on a specific date with the datepicker from jquery ui?
[02:36:00] <Cork> ?animate @ Raydiation
[02:36:01] <bot-t> Raydiation, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[02:36:30] <Cork> dareign85: you'll have to create it your self $('<form><field1><field2></form>')
[02:37:41] <Raydiation> is there no easy other way to just reverse the direction?
[02:37:58] <Whirl3d> dareign85, can you tell me how long a piece of string is?
[02:38:23] <Whirl3d> Raydiation, using css you can
[02:39:25] <Raydiation> basically what i want is kinda like a slideshow
[02:39:37] <Raydiation> when i click on the left button it should slide to the right
[02:39:44] <Raydiation> on the right it should slide to the left
[02:40:20] <Cork> Raydiation: so animate it, thats what animate is for
[02:40:31] <Raydiation> ok, ty
[02:40:36] <Whirl3d> ?.cycle@Raydiation
[02:40:40] <bot-t> Raydiation, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[02:40:57] <Whirl3d> What? bot-t has been drinking again...
[02:41:27] <Whirl3d> there's a "cycle" plugin that does very basic sliding of elements...it's lightweight and super easy to use.
[02:45:20] <XeruX> How can I display a div with form-elements below another div? :s  tooltip plugin?
[02:46:21] <tab1293> hey im trying to use a hover function to show a new div each time another div is rolled over. this new div lies right below the old div. when i try to implement the hover funtion how can i do so, that when the mouse is rolled over to the new div, the new div stil shows?
[02:48:39] <Whirl3d> tab1293, you will have to have a mousemove controller defined in a common parent element of the two divs
[02:49:17] <tab1293> what is a mousemove controller? never heard of it Whirl3d
[02:50:14] <thomedy> okay i have been at this for a while.. i can animate it css it, but all of my ideas havn't worked
[02:50:17] <Whirl3d> $("el").mousemove(function () {var xpos=e.pageX; var ypos=e.pageY; ...check if mouse position is in bounds of your two elements on the page});
[02:50:36] <thomedy> im trying to get a div to scroll with the screen but then wheni pass the content area for that box stay inside the content area
[02:50:39] <thomedy> recommendations
[02:51:27] <tab1293> Whirl3d, how you specify the postion of a hidden object?
[02:51:46] <Whirl3d> tab1293, make it opacity:0
[02:51:51] <Whirl3d> display:"block"
[02:52:25] <tab1293> yeah but i want the effect of it moving everything below down when opens
[02:52:34] <tab1293> will this still be achieved with opacity 0?
[02:52:42] <AdvoWork> if im doing alert(typeof aData) and it shows object, any reason why i'd get the error: Uncaught TypeError: Object when i do: aData.split(","); ?
[02:53:05] <tab1293> Whirl3d ^^
[02:53:06] <Whirl3d> .split is String method.
[02:53:26] <Whirl3d> tab1293, I'd need to see what you are trying to do.
[02:53:29] <Whirl3d> ?paste
[02:53:29] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:54:57] <Whirl3d> AdvoWork, try :   for (var prop in aData) {console.log(prop+": "+aData[prop]);}
[02:55:44] <Whirl3d> or just console.log(aData) in chrome and you can expand the object to see what's in it in the console
[02:55:48] <AdvoWork> Whirl3d, will that still work if aData changes for each row in the table? ie if i refresh the page and there are 20 rows, it alerts 20 different adata's
[02:56:10] <Whirl3d> just do it once to figure out what's in it
[02:56:29] <Whirl3d> don't even add it to you code
[02:56:51] <Whirl3d> just type "console.log(aData)" in the console to see what's in it
[02:58:36] <AdvoWork> Whirl3d, that gives http://pastebin.com/Kj5y3Tvw
[02:59:16] <tab1293_> Whirl3d: hold on let me try to get the code
[02:59:42] <thomedy> can someone point me to a tutorial on getting a div to scroll with window but stay in a relative div
[02:59:51] <thomedy> if i pass that div
[03:00:29] <jac0bz1> Howdy doody!
[03:00:59] <jac0bz1> http://jsbin.com/etehaz/3/edit#source <- Anyone that could help me here? When dropping an object, it only removes one of them from the table..?
[03:03:14] <Whirl3d> AdvoWork, seriously wtf? I mean if you don't even know what kind of data is being passed to your callbacks and you are confounded by the contents, what makes you think that someone who can't even look at your code, has never seen your code, and who is getting no information about your code could possible help?
[03:03:19] <Whirl3d> *possibly
[03:03:47] <Raydiation> are people already integrating css transitions into jquery?
[03:05:50] <tab1293_> im trying to make a drop down menu with jquery and this is what i have so far but its not quite exactly what i want. http://anes.ucla.edu/sim-sandbox/althome.php
[03:06:37] <tab1293_> when you scroll over news the div is expanded to show a submenu, i want this to happen but instead of enlarging the same div i want it to open a new div
[03:06:56] <tab1293_> how can i do this? i cant get the mouse functioning correctly
[03:06:56] <jac0bz1> tab1293: Create a new div then?
[03:06:57] <dareign85> $("input[name='quadant']:checked");
[03:07:00] <dareign85> this is correct?
[03:07:12] <dareign85> i want all the checked ones
[03:07:32] <tab1293_> jac0bz1: but how can i keep the new div showing when the mouse is over it?
[03:08:03] <tab1293_> cause the main menu div calls the rollover function but when i roll off the main the submenu closes
[03:08:11] <jac0bz1> keep showing it and destroy it when mouse leave
[03:08:45] <tab1293_> jac0bz1: what with like a while loop? how would i integrate that with jquery?
[03:08:52] <jac0bz1> give me a second.. I'll show you
[03:09:09] <tab1293_> thank you
[03:13:09] <chee> LALALA
[03:13:18] <chee> I AM GOING MAD
[03:14:24] <jac0bz1> tab1293_: http://jsbin.com/urelez/
[03:15:11] <tab1293_> jac0bz1: yes but when the mouse rolls off the green and onto the red i want to red div to still stay open
[03:15:21] <jac0bz1> ah..
[03:15:25] <jac0bz1> hold on
[03:15:48] <jac0bz1> http://jsbin.com/urelez/2/
[03:16:03] <jac0bz1> I should have guessed the logic in that :P
[03:16:24] <AdvoWork> if im doing alert(typeof aData) and it shows object, any reason why i'd get the error: Uncaught TypeError: Object when i do: aData.split(","); ? console.log(aData) shows http://pastebin.com/Kj5y3Tvw
[03:17:13] <tab1293_> jac0bz1: whats that div id submenu do
[03:17:54] <jac0bz1> Creates the DIV with an ID of submenu (for you're css)
[03:18:18] <tab1293_> you can insert jquery just like that
[03:18:26] <tab1293_> with that < /? tag?
[03:18:35] <tab1293_> *< ?>
[03:18:56] <tab1293_> cant type its dark, < />
[03:20:57] <jac0bz1> instead of writing <div></div> you can simplyfi it with a single <div/>
[03:26:06] <shadykhan> is it possible to display a certain image depending on what day it is?
[03:26:15] <jac0bz1> shure shadykhan
[03:26:34] <jac0bz1> multiple ways for doing that
[03:26:42] <xec> jac0bz1: not quite correct. if you mean inside jquery you only need <div> (no need to close) and in html you always need <div></div>
[03:26:44] <Leuthihi> Hello everyone.
[03:27:00] <shadykhan> jac0bz1: thanks alot ill figure it out im just making sure it was possible
[03:28:50] <jac0bz1> xec: That was indeed what I ment.. But I hope he knows enough html to understand that.. But a good thing to point out :)
[03:29:43] <jac0bz1> shadykhan: Just get the day of the week with javascript, then show an image with a prefix i.e monday-image.jpg or from a folder /monday/someimage.jpg
[03:31:01] <Tom__> anyone else not able to register to jsfiddle right now?
[03:31:21] <xec> jac0bz1: my point was that div is never a self contained tag - <div /> is never correct. jquery will let it slide though
[03:31:47] <jac0bz1> I know.
[03:32:10] <jac0bz1> jQuery just makes it easier when creating a dom element
[03:32:31] <XeruX> I want to bind click to window but exclude _one_ element
[03:32:54] <xec> jac0bz1: but you should really do $('<div>') and not $('<div />')
[03:48:07] <sendoushi> is it possible for jquery to animate height from 0 to "100%" ?
[03:54:31] <chee> xec: interessant
[03:58:44] <xec> sendoushi: by 100% you mean 100% of parent element's height, right? you can use .parent().height() for that
[03:58:59] <sendoushi> just solved thinking like that ;) thanks xec
[03:59:04] <sendoushi> now i'm with ajax problems :s
[03:59:28] <sendoushi> well not exactly ajax problems more like trying to implement ajax on a plugin of wordpress and ... not really working well
[03:59:57] <xec> sendoushi: you fixed it already? and i was having so much fun making a demo http://jsfiddle.net/ue58c/
[04:00:06] <sendoushi> :P thanks xec
[04:00:09] <xec> :D
[04:00:41] <sendoushi> you can always try and help me changing the plugin ehehe
[04:01:24] <xec> haha. maybe. if you can pinpoint and demonstrate the issue? :)
[04:02:02] <sendoushi> may I private?
[04:02:07] <xec> sure
[04:02:19] <sendoushi> awesome
[04:05:12] <XeruX> How do I check if '#add-user' is a parent of target for a click-event ?
[04:08:16] <rinkashimeo> Hi, if someone can help. I appreciate it... http://jsbin.com/ujirup/edit#javascript,html,live
[04:08:36] <xec> XeruX: maybe something like .closest("#add-user").length > 0
[04:09:02] <rinkashimeo> Id like to add before the title a close/open text
[04:09:04] <xec> or .parents()
[04:11:05] <varnie> hello
[04:11:22] <varnie> I have some variable holding the function, say var foo = function(){ // }
[04:11:28] <rinkashimeo> And the close or open text depends if its hidden or not... i dont no if i articulate myself clearly.
[04:11:28] <varnie> how can I call it from within jquery?
[04:11:34] <varnie> by its name, "foo"
[04:11:47] <Germanaz0> hello
[04:12:04] <Germanaz0> someone knows how to debug in chrome or firefox, for IE, because I have not Windows
[04:12:10] <Germanaz0> only Mac or Linux PCs :s
[04:12:22] <Germanaz0> for example, JSON.parse throws me an error in IE
[04:12:26] <Germanaz0> and FF 3.6
[04:12:35] <varnie> oky I got it: $(window.foo(123));
[04:15:40] <jac0bz1> firebug in FF?
[04:16:07] <xec> Germanaz0: you can't really debug for IE without IE...
[04:16:44] <xec> Germanaz0: http://caniuse.com/json
[04:17:04] <xec> is this ie7 ? :)
[04:18:14] <Germanaz0> thanks xec  :D
[04:23:46] <AdvoWork> If im clicking $('#all_purchase_orders td.control').live('click', function () {  how can i get the row id of that td?
[04:25:24] <xec> AdvoWork: where is the row id stored?
[04:25:28] <Germanaz0> AdvoWork, with $(this).attr('id')
[04:25:47] <xec> AdvoWork: you have an id attribute on each tr?
[04:26:12] <sendoushi> can't i do var msgViim .= on javascript? to add to the var?
[04:26:27] <xec> sendoushi: +=
[04:26:31] <sendoushi> ok thanks
[04:26:39] <xec> .= is php only, afaik
[04:26:44] <sendoushi> ;) thanks mate
[04:31:52] <mindis|wurk> is there any simple way to get the class version of a css attribute if it's been overridden by an inline version without wiping out the inline one in the process? for example, if i had a class .something { width: 500px; } and had used $('blah').css('width' '1000px');
[04:31:56] <AdvoWork> xec, it just <td id="whatever">
[04:32:08] <AdvoWork> Germanaz0, thanks will try
[04:32:27] <xec> AdvoWork: then you can just do: this.id
[04:34:00] <wltoriginal> hi everyone. Anyone know how to check if a background-image is visible in jquery?
[04:35:13] <avalarion> I need Help with replacing Strings... All easy... http://pastebin.com/Q8j8NDaT
[04:35:42] <AdvoWork> xec, alert($(this).attr('id')); didnt seem to work  and alert(this.id) also gave a blank alert. Row is set as: <tr class="odd" id="16598">
[04:35:47] <avalarion> alert shows, that hrefN has got a clean /myPage.html and not myPage/image0.html
[04:35:57] <Germanaz0> avalarion, with the :hidden selector do not work ?
[04:36:00] <xec> AdvoWork: you can't start an id with a number, i think
[04:36:17] <xec> AdvoWork: and that is a <tr>, not a <td> like you said
[04:36:40] <xec> AdvoWork: for that you would need $(this).parent().attr('id');
[04:36:56] <AdvoWork> xec, i said the row id of that td, so i meant the id of the <tr> that the clicked <td> belongs to if that makes sense?
[04:37:03] <AdvoWork> ahh ok, will test, thanks
[04:37:19] <avalarion> wltoriginal: Germanaz0 wanted to tell you =) He asked if the :hidden selector did not work.
[04:37:53] <Germanaz0> ahh sorry
[04:37:56] <Germanaz0> readed bad haha
[04:38:56] <avalarion> Germanaz0: I know this ;)
[04:39:13] <xec> avalarion: what is that snippet supposed to do?
[04:39:31] <fof> might be a bad question, but what do people prefer their php scripts return ajax calls, html text or json that is formatted client-side?
[04:39:33] <AdvoWork> xec, ive tried that, it gives blank alerts 3 times, then alerts the id on the 4th: http://pastebin.com/H83snanv  any reason why that would happen?
[04:39:48] <wltoriginal> avalarion and Germanaz0: sorry, i am a noob and am not sure how to use :hidden to query the element to see if the background-image value has been set (or visible).  How would I do this?
[04:40:21] <avalarion> xec: I give you an example... gallery1.html should be gallery1/image1.html if you click an image.
[04:40:37] <Germanaz0> $('.myBackgroundClass:hidden')
[04:41:18] <avalarion> nexttime you click an image '/image1.html' should be replaced by .html and then .html should be replaced by /image2.html
[04:41:23] <xec> AdvoWork: can you make a working demo? see ?demo
[04:41:24] <bot-t> AdvoWork, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:41:30] <wltoriginal> Germanaz0, but that checks the element and not its background's visibility?
[04:42:01] <xec> avalarion: what happens now
[04:42:50] <avalarion> xec replacer is /image0.html hrefN is gallery1.html
[04:42:59] <Germanaz0> right
[04:43:00] <avalarion> xec: and it does not replace^^
[04:43:02] <Germanaz0> wltoriginal,
[04:43:17] <Germanaz0> and how do you set visibility of the background
[04:43:19] <Germanaz0> or hide it ?
[04:43:28] <aqeel> hi room
[04:43:46] <aqeel> $(function(){ 	$("contact").hover( 	function () {$("#content").load("info.html #contact");}, 	function () {$("#content").load("index.html #home");} 	); });
[04:43:53] <aqeel> how to have it working...
[04:44:02] <aqeel> in html script workis fine
[04:44:19] <aqeel> but in seperate file it is not doing anything
[04:44:44] <wltoriginal> Germanaz0, by hovering over the picture, my css is supposed to set a background, and when i go away, the background color should disappear.
[04:44:52] <AdvoWork> xec, even though my data is gained from a php file echo'd as a json?
[04:44:54] <avalarion> aqeel: did you surround it with jquery.ready() ?
[04:44:55] <wltoriginal> but this doesnt happen
[04:45:02] <wltoriginal> :(
[04:45:04] <fof> can you share your separate file
[04:45:23] <aqeel> $(function() = jquery.ready()???
[04:45:52] <aqeel> using jquery 1.7.1
[04:46:19] <xec> avalarion: this is probably not foolproof, but
[04:46:26] <xec> ?eval "gallery1.html".replace(/(gallery([0-9]))/, "$1/image$2")
[04:46:27] <bot-t> xec: "gallery1/image1.html"
[04:47:35] <aqeel> please what could be wrong?
[04:47:41] <avalarion> aqeel: http://api.jquery.com/ready/ I guess your contact is not yet available for jquery
[04:48:01] <avalarion> xec ty! will try this now
[04:49:13] <DukeDrake> $('div').addClass() or  $('div').each( ... addClass() ..); ?
[04:50:01] <aqeel> jQuery(document).ready(function($) { 	$("contact").hover( 	function(){$("#content").load("info.html #contact");}, 	function(){$("#content").load("index.html #home");} 	); });
[04:50:06] <aqeel> not working???
[04:50:09] <AdvoWork> xec, this is what i have so far http://jsfiddle.net/Brb9R/  but not sure how i'm going to acheive the getting of the data via the .php file?
[04:51:08] <xec> AdvoWork: view source in browser?
[04:51:44] <xec> AdvoWork: there is no id in the html you posted. and theres a buttload of javascript pasted in for such a simple question
[04:52:42] <avalarion> aqeel: what says the error log?
[04:52:49] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[04:52:56] <xec> xD
[04:53:06] <xec> aqeel: hit save and post the new url
[04:53:20] <fof> function($)
[04:54:03] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/Tm2rz/
[04:54:13] <aqeel> sorry...
[04:54:26] <mindis|wurk> goddamn it can be painful to get positions correctly
[04:54:32] <jeffsmykil> checked="checked" has to be one of the stupidest html values ever
[04:55:02] <aqeel> so what might be wrong
[04:55:15] <xec> you don't actually need the ="checked" part, unless you're coding xhtml
[04:56:10] <xec> and lets face it, there's no good reason your document needs to be xml compliant ;)
[04:56:18] <jeffsmykil> heh
[04:56:25] <jeffsmykil> xec chercked = true?
[04:56:31] <AdvoWork> xec, actually, alert("C:"+$(this).parent().attr('id')); works, sorry
[04:56:39] <jeffsmykil> i always forget it needs to be checked=checked
[04:56:47] <xec> jeffsmykil: no, just <input type="checkbox" checked> will suffice
[04:57:02] <jeffsmykil> using xhtml strict
[04:57:10] <xec> whyyyyy (echo echo echo)
[04:57:28] <jeffsmykil> I
[04:57:31] <mindis|wurk> why not, it's good. except it doesn't support iframes :/
[04:57:49] <jeffsmykil> Not sure, I think its what the asp.net defaulted to when this project started
[04:57:57] <aqeel> what is wrong? why my code not working
[04:58:31] <xec> the browser is not gonna parse it like xml anyway. xhtml was a bad idea and it's why xhtml2 is useless and html5 was created
[04:58:51] <jeffsmykil> xec you know how companies are
[04:58:56] <jeffsmykil> something gets started one way
[04:59:05] <mindis|wurk> html5 is also pretty much useless :P
[04:59:28] <xec> well.. html5's biggest weakness is that is is: still bloody html :P
[04:59:30] <jeffsmykil> mindis|wurk: not if you don't do production work!
[05:00:09] <xec> but it's not nearly as annoying and stupid as xhtml
[05:00:15] <xec> :D
[05:00:23] <mindis|wurk> it's just a wrap of gimmicks that are already here. whoopdedoo. well okay, maybe not canvas and such but overall it's far too lenient and fucking late
[05:00:26] <aqeel> so any wanna help..
[05:00:36] <jeffsmykil> if the website i built didnt have to be used for enterprise stuff id use html5
[05:01:22] <xec> mindis|wurk: well, i see html5 as just that. just html - all the other nonsense is extra modules
[05:01:40] <jeffsmykil> we have the majority of our customers running IE 7
[05:01:49] <jeffsmykil> we are lucky if they have upgraded from IE 6
[05:01:50] <fof> aqeel i recommend the jquery tutorial on the official site
[05:01:52] <mindis|wurk> you need to kill your customers
[05:02:03] <jeffsmykil> mindis|wurk: health care
[05:02:05] <xec> jeffsmykil: still no reason to use xhtml
[05:02:13] <TimothyA> mindis|wurk: I recommend mustard or sarin gas
[05:02:19] <mindis|wurk> sounds good
[05:02:21] <avalarion> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/55Y3j/
[05:02:28] <aqeel> html from day one was meant to be html......LAYOUT....only...css and javascript + other stuff to spice html...
[05:02:51] <mindis|wurk> xec i found xhtml infinitely more useful than html's inconsistent sloppyness that allows all kinds of weird shit
[05:03:01] <avalarion> missed # at the contact selector
[05:03:10] <avalarion> and I did use bind and not hover
[05:03:25] <mindis|wurk> the stricter the language is the better. no room for interpratations
[05:03:35] <aqeel> well guys javascripting works fine but when in external file it is not firing....so dont tell me to see tutorial...unless they specuify how to do it in external file
[05:03:40] <mindis|wurk> though of course, the main problem lies in css implementation
[05:03:47] <xec> mindis|wurk: well, its weird shit like checked="checked" that annoys me ;) but each his own i guess
[05:04:24] <mindis|wurk> i didn't say it was perfect, just an improvement
[05:04:41] <mindis|wurk> thought tbh i think the whole html+css+js needs to go but that's not gonna happen
[05:05:07] <xec> yeah i agree, it's a horrible platform to build on
[05:06:08] <mindis|wurk> it was fine back when there were no browser conflicts and everything was static but it just doesn't cut it these days when you need constant interaction between various parts of a system
[05:06:28] <xec> although, the more i get used to javascript, the less i enjoy going back serverside and coding c#
[05:06:47] <mindis|wurk> my server side is php. is that better or worse to you? ;)
[05:07:03] <StevenCodes22> sup
[05:07:08] <aqeel> back when no browser conflict .....all bowsers have their own problems and html was not stadardedly coded into old browsers
[05:07:40] <xec> actually, i like php, but theres just too easy to create shit code
[05:08:11] <mindis|wurk> aqeel don't be silly, of course there was a time like that. back when there was only one browser ;)
[05:08:18] <xec> so when looking at other peoples c# project i can usually find my way around, but with php all bets are off
[05:08:18] <fof> even good php code looks shit :)
[05:08:27] <StevenCodes22> mindis|wurk: netscape ?
[05:08:30] <xec> fof: haha true
[05:08:34] <StevenCodes22> takin a guess here
[05:08:36] <StevenCodes22> lol
[05:09:29] <jeffsmykil> any recs on nice canvas graphs?
[05:09:34] <jeffsmykil> nice to work with easy to style etc
[05:09:36] <mindis|wurk> StevenCodes22 you're right actually, netscape is the later name of that browser :)
[05:09:53] <StevenCodes22> think it went netscape 5 then ie 6
[05:10:04] <StevenCodes22> i wasnt even born then lol
[05:10:13] <mazzachre> On my machine I get a keypress event when I press 'Alt Gr', that does not register on my collegues Windows machine... Is that normal?
[05:10:16] <mindis|wurk> well technically it probably wasn't THE first browser but the first mainstream one anyway. under the name of mosaic
[05:10:40] <StevenCodes22> mazzachre:  Not all windows machines have same keypress abilities for windows
[05:10:42] <xec> i thought mosaic turned into IE eventually
[05:10:46] <xec> not netscape
[05:10:52] <aqeel> well that code kinda helped but as itr fires it just diasppears into the air....
[05:10:53] <mazzachre> StevenCodes22: I don't use windows :)
[05:11:11] <StevenCodes22> mazzachre: Oh then I have not a clue :)
[05:11:34] <aqeel> well onmouse over should keep onmouse over content and not just for blink of an eye
[05:11:38] <mindis|wurk> xec seems like you're right. the history of that are is very convoluted
[05:11:42] <mindis|wurk> *era
[05:11:49] <mazzachre> StevenCodes22: Well I was just wondering if it was an error on my system that Alt Gr gave a key press event and keycode (0)
[05:12:19] <mindis|wurk> but anyhoo, the point remains. no (real) competition, no compatibility problems
[05:12:22] <StevenCodes22> mazzachre:  Lookup Virtual Keyboard Layout, That will tell you :D
[05:12:27] <aqeel> yes and that one browser soes not support html standards at that time
[05:12:36] <StevenCodes22> 0x29 i think is what r idk
[05:12:47] <xec> mindis|wurk: i can't wait to get old and talk to my grandkids about how the world was before the internet!
[05:12:50] <mindis|wurk> doesn't matter, none of the current ones implement anything flawless
[05:13:30] <mindis|wurk> firefox is so full of shit it boggles my mind sometimes
[05:13:32] <StevenCodes22> xec: mindis|wurk Not to be a spammer but im trying to get someone to take this domain Gotactics, interested ?
[05:14:38] <mazzachre> mindis|wurk: No competition also meams no moving forward... Without competition we would still be stuck with frames, tables for layout and without javascript, semitransparency etc...
[05:15:16] <aqeel> what say about css 3.....
[05:15:21] <StevenCodes22> mazzachre:  Many people are still stuck with those prolems :D
[05:15:27] <xec> mazzachre: and things like javascript wouldnt be pushed out of the door after a week or so of development :P
[05:15:34] <aqeel> now implimenting 3d into browsers
[05:15:35] <teeher> http://floreus.com.au/buy-now/ <- how would I get it to add all the values of the checkboxes instead of .length
[05:15:36] <teeher> I am trying to get the total amount
[05:15:44] <mindis|wurk> mazzachre maybe, maybe not. but you forget where this started: all that is just adding things on top of a bad architecture with gum
[05:16:04] <mindis|wurk> or rather an architecture that was never designed to be handled that way
[05:16:51] <mazzachre> mindis|wurk: I didn't read the where it started :) And yes that is how the world works... Stuff is added to make something work in a sligtly different way until it topples, then something else takes over...
[05:17:30] <aqeel> i can't believe it.....
[05:17:48] <mazzachre> StevenCodes22: IE6 is all but gone now... IE7 and 8 are on a steep decline... And for a change IE9 seems to be playing at least nice enough to get some usage from modern websites...
[05:18:02] <aqeel> it was a small typo error.....# missing and people giving their codes.....and now everything works...
[05:18:25] <aqeel> i appreciate the help whole heartedly...thanks
[05:18:40] <aqeel> now my journey begins for this site i am makin...
[05:18:45] <StevenCodes22> mazzachre:  I hate IE! but always make sure my shit cross-browser capable
[05:19:05] <StevenCodes22> aqeel: Which site ?
[05:19:26] <aqeel> working on it...
[05:19:33] <aqeel> jailbreak stuff
[05:20:12] <mindis|wurk> i have the fortune of working for companies that only care about functionality on the latest FF, chrome and IE. i don't need to care about the tantrums of IE6-8
[05:20:28] <mazzachre> StevenCodes22: I usually make it so at least the basics work in IE7 (If anything is really needed for it to work.. if it is just display, I don't care) and the site actually looks and works in FF, chrome (and hope the apple thing also works) and assume it will keep working, only better, in newer versions of IE
[05:20:47] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[05:20:48] <StevenCodes22> mazzachre:  What you working on ?
[05:21:05] <mindis|wurk> heck, the main product of the previous company would effectively crash IE6 because it had too much JS for it
[05:21:06] <StevenCodes22> aqeel for phones ?
[05:21:29] <mazzachre> mindis|wurk: We had a customer that called in with stuff not looking good... Turned out they were using IE6 and their monitors were capable of 800x600 res... WTF! It is 2012 not 1998... sigh
[05:22:12] <mazzachre> StevenCodes22: We have a number of products... Mainly I work backend/admin stuff...
[05:22:28] <aqeel> nope info only and app database from modmyi and bigboss as their site is somehow not impressed me..
[05:22:31] <StevenCodes22> mazzachre:  Mind for PM ?
[05:22:39] <mazzachre> StevenCodes22: sure
[05:22:41] <terryleigh> in two multiple select boxes, how would I remove the list in one box from the other? I'm doing an option transfer, but the selected loads previously selected options.
[05:22:47] <StevenCodes22> aqeel Yeah I see tha tand it looks really good
[05:23:16] <mindis|wurk> mazzachre that would've been subpar even for 98. we just say "upgrade your browser"
[05:23:20] <aqeel> layout is totally css3
[05:23:35] <aqeel> old browsers sorry still havew to work on that
[05:24:13] <aqeel> ok guys the time it is taking to load is really long...can i shorten that
[05:24:27] <aqeel> i mean onmouseover the contact
[05:24:35] <mazzachre> mindis|wurk: Problem is, it is government customer... So they don't upgrade that regulary. So I was put to work making a special page for them that would work in 800x600... And work in IE6...
[05:24:57] <mindis|wurk> D:
[05:25:03] <mindis|wurk> that's pretty terrifying
[05:27:15] <fof> aqeel you could maybe show/hide rather than load? not compared the two myself
[05:27:59] <mazzachre> mindis|wurk: Well, It was just going back to basics... I pretty much removed everything nice, added the basic form we use to a table layout and removed Ajax handling so it went back to default POST and wait, and removed all the enhancing we have on our forms (no drag and drop of elements etc...) so they instead could select from a multiselect list etc... And writing out the tooltips in the table aswell instead of having it available on mouse over... And
[05:27:59] <mazzachre> everything worked...
[05:28:02] <aqeel> well that is the case show hide makes one longgggggggggg page and i have coded that into external file and load that specific id
[05:28:15] <mazzachre> mindis|wurk: It looked like something the cat would not consider eating anymore though :)
[05:32:03] <fof> you could load the separate html files into blank elements on DOM ready, then hide/show on hover?
[05:33:11] <wltoriginal> how does one round corners on ie7 with jquery?
[05:33:29] <aqeel> if i manually put those codes ih respective html....onmouseover and onmouseout.....the speed is faster
[05:34:00] <StevenCodes22> aqeel: I like your images on your site as well very smooth
[05:34:21] <aqeel> only 5 imges
[05:34:31] <aqeel> jailbreak and repo icons
[05:34:41] <StevenCodes22> aqeel PM ?
[05:34:42] <aqeel> rest is css3
[05:34:46] <aqeel> ok
[05:40:26] <styol> wltoriginal: you can use css3pie.com
[05:40:54] <oal> Is it possible to console.log the content of a css document loaded from a <link>?
[05:41:29] <ravenzz> no
[05:41:42] <ravenzz> you should grab it with an ajax call i guess
[05:42:09] <oal> ravenzz: thanks, will try
[05:44:10] <wltoriginal> styol: thanks for the suggestion.
[05:44:33] <styol> wltoriginal: no problem
[05:44:42] <tutukatu_> how detect that:  has quit [Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.] ? ? ?
[05:45:20] <gnagno> hello all
[05:45:27] <terryleigh> anyone know how'd I'd remove matching options from one select box from another one?
[05:46:06] <ravenzz> terryleigh paste your markup on jsfiddle.net please
[05:46:13] <gnagno> is there any jquery plugin that given a very very big image will allow me to let users navigate it like in google maps? I 'd like to load in the client only the minimum required amount of image each time....
[05:47:24] <ravenzz> google maps are multiple images
[05:47:59] <ravenzz> so when you move it other images are loaded
[05:48:01] <styol> tutukatu_: $.each(kitten, function(saucer, milk) { if (milk == 'warm') { purr('happily'); });
[05:48:15] <gnagno> ravenzz, ok, I can work even with multiple images server side.... but I'd like to achieve the same effect (starting with a low resolution image that will show me the whole picture and zoom as I move)
[05:48:23] <ravenzz> you could look for a php script that splits your images into parts
[05:49:16] <tutukatu_> styol: wtf? i am just curious about that
[05:49:47] <ravenzz> perhaps you could play with a matrix, so you have some breakpoints and the images you have to load
[05:49:55] <ravenzz> when each breakpoint is reached
[05:50:18] <gnagno> ravenzz, isn't there anything ready?
[05:50:24] <ravenzz> dunno
[05:50:27] <styol> tutukatu_: haha sorry this is what I saw -- tutukatu_: how detect that:  has quit [Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.] ? ? ?
[05:51:04] <tutukatu_> styol: I mean how a web script detect that?
[05:51:47] <ravenzz> gnagno http://www.azoffdesign.com/overscroll
[05:51:48] <ravenzz> ?
[05:52:10] <terryleigh> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/xvjmx/
[05:52:58] <styol> tutukatu_: I'm not sure something of the sort is exposed to the layer at which jQuery is located
[05:53:53] <gnagno> ravenzz, thank you for the link, but it doesn't support zoom
[05:53:56] <tutukatu_> styol: You mean like cache is not avaliable for jQuery script ?
[05:54:04] <jeffreylevesque> is there a jQuery slideToggle sideways?
[05:54:08] <jeffreylevesque> is there a jQuery 'slideToggle sideways'?
[05:54:16] <ravenzz> terracotta so when you select 1 from the 1st select you want to remove the same element from the 2nd select?
[05:54:27] <ravenzz> terryleigh ^
[05:54:54] <jeffreylevesque> styol: you own the jQuery channel as well lol
[05:55:00] <jeffreylevesque> you the man
[05:55:03] <ravenzz> gnagno correct, try to search it on google
[05:55:28] <gnagno> ravenzz, I am searching since this morning
[05:55:39] <Wiz_KeeD> has anyone here worked with jquery mobile?
[05:56:18] <styol> jeffreylevesque: nahhh I don't say all that much in here heh, love jquery tho, it's the hawtness
[05:57:00] <jeffreylevesque> styol: you're like 'texas pete' you bring hawtness to the web
[05:57:27] <terryleigh> ravenzz: the transfer option is working.. I just want what's in the 2nd box to be subtracted from the 1st when the page loads.
[05:57:36] <minna> Hello
[05:58:08] <styol> jeffreylevesque: I'm not sure if I would co-sign that statement haha
[05:58:35] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone worked with jquery mobile?
[05:58:48] <minna> I have a problem with lint, it says i should combine a var with previous var statement, but i am redeclaring the var inside an if statement. Shurely i should not combine it with the var outside of the if statement?
[05:58:49] <ravenzz> terryleigh 1st of all you must specify a value for the options
[06:01:35] <keybo> with the returned json from a google maps api call, will the address components always be in the same place in the array?
[06:03:30] <keybo> or is there a way to only request certain locality types in the call?
[06:04:40] <StevenCodes22> keybo I have a way to do that ut not with google API I use accuweather forecast center and Curl
[06:05:40] <ravenzz> terryleigh http://jsfiddle.net/2eFns/
[06:06:07] <ravenzz> minna paste!
[06:06:26] <terryleigh> ravenzz: thanks! that's perfect

[06:16:12] <airdem> how can i make .sortable('serialize') count the items from bottom up?
[06:16:28] <airdem> the first item should have the highest order number not 0
[06:18:40] <StevenCodes22> Whos got a res above 1500 ?
[06:20:58] <brettster> hey guys
[06:21:19] <Log1x> how do i use .$ajax to load a specific div of a url: location? do i just put #divname at teh end of the url string
[06:21:21] <Log1x> ?
[06:21:22] <brettster> is there any way to create an rss feed that displays images
[06:22:03] <styol> airdem: I'm not familiar with sortable but it's commonly referred to as descending as it descends 3 2 1 instead of ascending 1 2 3
[06:22:41] <StevenCodes22> Log1x: example ?
[06:22:53] <shadykhan> how can i autumatically add classes to an element with a timer?
[06:23:29] <Log1x> StevenCodes22: the equiv to $("#blah").load("media/content/"+$(this).attr("href")+".php" #contentContainer, function() {
[06:23:46] <Log1x> primarily the #contentContainer portion of which it'd grab from the .php loaded
[06:23:53] <Log1x> how can i do that same thing but with $.ajax
[06:25:03] <StevenCodes22> Log1x $("#contentContainer").load("media/content/"+$(this).attr("href")+".php?Variablesarehere=VariableValue"
[06:25:13] <styol> shadykhan: I'm not sure what you mean by with a timer but $('#target').delay(1000).addClass('oneclass twoclass');
[06:25:15] <StevenCodes22> thatll do same
[06:25:50] <Log1x> i dont want to use .load though, i want to use $.ajax but still only return the contents of a specific div
[06:25:52] <shadykhan> styol: thanks  i beleive that should work
[06:26:14] <Log1x> in the line i posted its getting the contents of #contentContainer -- i want to do that same thing, but with $.ajax and using the url: setting
[06:26:43] <minna> Why do Lint suggest that it combine the variable that is in the if statement? http://pastebin.com/rpA10jbs
[06:27:04] <StevenCodes22>  Log1x .load is an Ajax call and the example i provided will do so
[06:29:11] <minna> No one?
[06:30:04] <Log1x> im not wanting to do variables though, im talking about pulling a specific div from the content that is .loaded which you can do by $("#contentWrapper").load("blah.php #content", function(){ } -- but i want to use full $.ajax instead of the .load alias, and im not sure if I should put the div I want to pull in url: or context: or.. -- it's not saying anywhere clearly on http://api.jquery.com/
[06:30:05] <Log1x> jQuery.ajax/
[06:30:09] <xec> minna: you do not have block scope in javascript
[06:30:26] <Log1x> in my example its loadig #content within blah.php into the #contentWrapper div
[06:30:28] <xec> minna: so the var statement in your if would be scoped to the function it is in
[06:30:38] <xec> minna: make sense?
[06:30:59] <minna> xec: So the if statement shoud be in its own function? O_o
[06:31:23] <Log1x> im trying to incorperate jquery into my php template to make it when the users javascript is enabled it will hijack links and parse the php $.ajax and display it in a more fluid manner that doesn't include a full page refresh
[06:31:32] <Log1x> using $.ajax to try and achieve that seems more sane than using the load alias
[06:31:36] <xec> minna: if you need a namespace/variable scope inside it (which i doubt you do)
[06:32:01] <minna> xec: It's not that advanced function :)
[06:32:17] <minna> xec: it just seem odd to me that lint complains on such a trivial thing.
[06:32:17] <xec> minna: just do "var whatever" at the beginning of your function and "whatever = value" inside the if
[06:32:44] <minna> xec: you mean declare it outside of the if?
[06:32:49] <xec> minna: yes
[06:33:01] <xec> minna: doing var inside an if is not really wrong - it's just a sign of a programmer not knowing how js works
[06:33:17] <xec> which is why lint complains
[06:33:23] <tutukatu_> "use strict"
[06:33:26] <xec> lint complains about a lot of trivial stuff
[06:33:29] <minna> xec: How else woudl i re-declare what is inside a variable?
[06:33:59] <xec> minna: i don't follow...
[06:34:03] <minna> xec: i tried setting jsonData = null, outside of the if statement, lint still complains.
[06:35:11] <xec> minna: http://pastebin.com/ftDRj3n9
[06:35:56] <minna> xec: Still says i should combine the var inside the if with the previous if's.
[06:36:00] <minna> eh vars
[06:36:15] <minna> xec: Still says i should combine the var inside the if with the previous vars.
[06:36:56] <minna> oh now i see
[06:37:21] <xec> i forgot to remove a , and add a ; on line 11, but you get the point
[06:37:38] <xec> postUrl should be declared too
[06:37:42] <styol> need to add postUrl
[06:37:47] <minna> xec: yes i do, thanks.
[06:43:34] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/mzQXq/
[06:43:43] <aqeel> guys both code do same thing
[06:43:55] <aqeel> but the time it takes to load is alot...
[06:44:12] <aqeel> any direct coding to reduce this latency  time
[06:44:29] <minna> xec: I think it's the most common thing that people that do jquery don't know proper javascript.
[06:44:38] <xec> aqeel: .load() is an ajax function.... which is a http request - and you've slapped it inside a mouse event
[06:45:03] <xec> minna: thats true, i'm quite guilty myself in that regard :)
[06:45:12] <keybo> how do i loop through an array within an array?
[06:45:16] <aqeel> agree else how to call content from external file?
[06:45:42] <xec> keybo: same way you loop once, you just do it inside the loop
[06:46:02] <minna> xec: That's my biggest problem, takes time to catch up. It makes sense to know javascript before jquery.
[06:46:25] <shadykhan> i have this in my code $('.item').delay(1000).addClass('hover');
[06:46:37] <shadykhan> but when i refresh the page the class applies instantly
[06:46:58] <xec> aqeel: do the load() once, and hide/show the div with mouse events?
[06:47:12] <aqeel> no but whenever on and off
[06:47:44] <xec> shadykhan: .delay() will only delay animation queue
[06:47:59] <minna> xec: Also, javascipt beautifier and lint doesn't agree :-S
[06:48:01] <shadykhan> ahh okay
[06:48:07] <fof> aqeel do try show/hide
[06:48:15] <xec> shadykhan: you can use native setTimeout to wait
[06:48:48] <xec> minna: oh? in what regard?
[06:49:42] <aqeel> show hide will be same again....to show will call load from external file and hide will call self content in html
[06:49:50] <minna> xec: If i do beautify on this: if (data === undefined) {return false; }
[06:50:07] <fof> no, you load the data once, then show/hide it on mouseovers
[06:50:22] <minna> xec: oh, wait, nvm :-D
[06:50:24] <fof> rather than load on each mouseover
[06:51:29] <aqeel> and how do u intend to do that without cluttering the index page
[06:55:36] <aqeel> so any better alternative for this load and show/hide stuff that can increase performance
[07:08:44] <brettster> Hey guys

[08:21:17] <Jonno_FTW> sparuvu: what do you meant to say?
[08:21:36] <sparuvu> I mean…..
[08:21:37] <jugglinmike> Although it looks like data is an object in your case, AdvoWork
[08:21:43] <sparuvu> lets say I have 3 cases
[08:21:43] <AdvoWork> jugglinmike, actually, alert("Length:"+data.length); gives undefined, I've been accessing one part of that element by doing: alert("data4:"+data.aaData[0][1]);  any ideas?
[08:22:03] <sparuvu> case 1: will fire 2 ajax calls and case 2 will fire 3 ajax calls etc
[08:22:06] <Jonno_FTW> I googled $.when, and the first result was a death clock
[08:22:10] <jugglinmike> yeah, data is an object
[08:22:20] <jugglinmike> so it depends on what you mean by "how many records"
[08:22:21] <AdvoWork> jugglinmike, alert("Length:"+data.aaData.length); works
[08:22:30] <sparuvu> now I want to pass these variable number of ajax req. to $.when ?
[08:22:31] <jugglinmike> I don't know what your data is structured like
[08:23:07] <jugglinmike> but assuming that all the records are in the data.aaData array, you should be able to get the number with data.aaData.length
[08:23:38] <sparuvu> Jonno_FTW: :) am I clear with my question ?
[08:24:06] <piukeman> I have a mess with my site I am using a tutorial, one I took from a tutorial, and the problem is that the links in the menu bar are not working. I will appreciate if someone can give me a bit of help...
[08:24:15] <piukeman> http://pastebin.com/3M4XAsup
[08:24:23] <piukeman> http://pastebin.com/gXWaW5GF
[08:25:15] <sparuvu> Jonno_FTW:    if I put all these ajax s into an object then it wont work as $.when only checks if the vale of the parametrs exisists or not
[08:25:53] <sparuvu> Jonno_FTW: you there ?
[08:25:55] <piukeman> the fact is that when i clic on a button nothing happens... I mean the link goes no where
[08:26:19] <Jonno_FTW> sparuvu: I am here, I cannot answer your question, sorry
[08:26:26] <Jonno_FTW> I am not familiar with $.then
[08:26:46] <sparuvu> hmmmmm not a problem sir thank you
[08:26:59] <jugglinmike> Has there been any discussion about making Event.target a jQuery object? Or defining Event.$target?
[08:27:01] <sparuvu> atleast yo are the first one who attempted to answer it
[08:27:03] <sparuvu> thanks
[08:27:12] <Jonno_FTW> read the docs is all I can say
[08:27:30] <sparuvu> I went through…..but its ok no use...
[08:27:47] <sparuvu> $.when does not open the arguments and check the values...
[08:29:09] <jcrawford> can anyone in here lend a hand with fancybox plugin?
[08:33:19] <ShadowChancellor> Question: How can you bind multiple functions to the same event handler with the on() function?
[08:35:08] <warrenparsons> ShadowChancellor: $('#foo').on('click', function(){ function1(); function2(); function3(); });
[08:35:24] <ShadowChancellor> Nice!
[08:35:27] <ShadowChancellor> Thanks! :D
[08:35:30] <warrenparsons> yep

[08:39:23] <brettster> Hey guys
[08:39:29] <brettster> is there a way with jquery
[08:39:38] <brettster> to "query" through an rss feed
[08:39:54] <brettster> and select post number 2 instead of post 1
[08:40:04] <brettster> or post 2, 5., 7
[08:40:19] <jeffreylevesque> thanks andrew9183
[08:40:35] <johnkpaul> brettster: https://github.com/jfhovinne/jFeed might help you, but it has to b on the same domain
[08:40:38] <johnkpaul> be*
[08:41:48] <brettster> what would have to be on the same domain?
[08:42:04] <johnkpaul> the rss feed
[08:42:05] <brettster> meaning - the blog would have to be on the same domain as the website
[08:42:12] <brettster> or rss feed
[08:42:17] <brettster> so for example
[08:42:20] <brettster> if i'm using blogger
[08:42:26] <brettster> or wordpress
[08:42:44] <brettster> which would obv be on a separate domain that my site
[08:42:47] <johnkpaul> the rss feed has to be on the same domain as the domain where the javascript is running, or what is in the location bar of your end user
[08:42:48] <brettster> it won't work?
[08:43:15] <johnkpaul> no
[08:43:15] <johnkpaul> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy

[08:51:32] <DofLeFou> Greetings guys
[08:52:25] <DofLeFou> I have the following http://jsfiddle.net/P2KD2/
[08:53:26] <DofLeFou> It works just fine moving a selected row and down
[08:54:05] <DofLeFou> I found a little issue with it … when my table is in Pagination mode
[08:54:28] <beasty> evening all
[08:54:37] <beasty> sean` :)
[08:56:19] <sphinxxx> wee
[08:56:27] <sphinxxx> anyone using colloquy?
[09:09:29] <chee> i imagine the people in #colloquy are :3
[09:09:54] <Harkins> I want to do $('table').append("<tr><td>foo</td></tr>") but grab that tr DOM element (or in a jQuery selector) - is there a function like append() that returns the thing appended, or a way to build the the element before I append() it?
[09:10:54] <quicksilver> Harkins: appendTo()
[09:12:41] <Harkins> quicksilver: Oh, I see. I missed that in the first reading of the doc, let me experiment. :)
[09:12:57] <leifcr> Harkins: or you can do this    var something = $('<tr><td>foo</td></tr>')
[09:13:11] <leifcr> Harkins: then you can manipulate that before you append it to the doc...
[09:13:46] <quicksilver> also quite true of course. jquery isn't magic it's just expressions you can save objects into variables :)
[09:14:27] <leifcr> I would most likely go for quicksilver's method, as it's highly likely that you are going to add the content to the page anyhow...
[09:15:39] <Harkins> quicksilver: that's perfect, thanks
[09:15:50] <Harkins> leifcr: Ah, I didn't know it'd make HTML like that. Learn something every day.
[09:15:57] <Harkins> Thanks for both your suggestions.
[09:20:20] <Log1x> is there something like "isin" or "ison" for javascript/jquery? trying to make it if .php is in the $(location).attr('pathname') it'll perform a certain action =l or rather if theres no page and its just the index.php or "/" -- any help? :)
[09:21:20] <Anime> .match, .indexOf
[09:21:24] <leifcr> Log1x: are you trying to verify if a location is valid based on a http request or a file-check ?
[09:22:11] <Log1x> im doing dynamic content with a php template and having jquery do a fadein and what not, and wanted an if statement to see if they are requesting a specific page.php and otherwise just do a default action
[09:24:34] <leifcr> Log1x: So if they appear on page.php, x should happen, else a default action should happen... or is it they appear on page.php, and if they want page2.php x should happen, else default should happen?
[09:25:17] <Log1x> well i have it where if they have javascript enabled, it hides my content container exposing the background, and then they can click the nav and it'll fade it in. but i want if they request a specific page, it doesn't burden them with hiding the content container
[09:27:06] <leifcr> Log1x, then you can do like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406192/how-to-get-the-current-url-in-jquery and use the pathname to check if you should hide/show stuff.
[09:27:50] <leifcr> Log1x: or you can do it in your php file before the page is shown. most likely that is a better approach, if you are worried about the user having javascript enabled/disabled
[09:27:52] <Log1x> yeah im trying to use $(location).attr('pathname'); right now but i dont know how to check within it and do the regex to make sure theres no .php or file being requested.
[09:28:03] <leifcr> (although 99% have javascript enabled nowadays)
[09:30:01] <Log1x> http://www.privatepaste.com/2d3be33a04 theres snippet of the code im working with, i just need to know how to check if there is a page or whatever being requested
[09:30:14] <Log1x> the site itself is in a subfolder so what i have now doesn't work since hash is pulling /sitefolder/
[09:31:36] <sphinxxx> are there any tools that will benchmark / give a number score of your javascript/jquery efficiency?
[09:35:19] <soc42> hey #jquery
[09:35:21] <soc42> i am having trouble accessing radio values via jquery with an array as name
[09:35:25] <soc42> if i choose a simple name="bar" in the input field, jquery has no problem to get access to the radio values...
[09:35:53] <soc42> but when i choose name="foo[bar]" in the input field, jquery won't access the values
[09:36:36] <soc42> i think jquery is having trouble with escaping the double bracket [], like...
[09:36:52] <soc42> jQuery('input:radio[name=foo[bar][next]]:checked').val()
[09:37:03] <Eviltwin> So escape them
[09:37:16] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[09:37:47] <soc42> i tried a single backslashes before the input array's brackets and two slashes before...
[09:37:53] <Flavius1924> can you tell me how can i toggle some UL if i press on a <p>  ?
[09:37:54] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/JAPtR/2/ How is foo not out of scope?
[09:38:01] <Flavius1924> i have the code in here http://jsfiddle.net/dXX5z/
[09:38:19] <Eviltwin> soc42: It should always be an even number of \'s in each grouping
[09:38:45] <Eviltwin> innociv: No, scope doesn't work that way in JavaScript
[09:39:02] <soc42> k, fixed
[09:39:08] <Eviltwin> innociv: The scope of a variable is the innermost function it's inside
[09:39:18] <Eviltwin> It's called variable hoisiting
[09:39:37] <Eviltwin> http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.scopes
[09:40:03] <soc42> the problem was not the escaping of the brackets, but the array-var label as a whole has to be set in double ticks, like "foo[bar]" instead of foo\[bar\]
[09:40:27] <Eviltwin> soc42: I know how it has to be, you don't have to tell me
[09:40:36] <innociv> Really? That's crazy. :|
[09:40:51] <innociv> So I have to use different variable names. Bleh
[09:40:55] <Eviltwin> innociv: It's actually logical
[09:41:02] <Eviltwin> Makes scope resolution a hell of a lot simpler
[09:41:03] <soc42> but you are not alone Eviltwin ;o)
[09:42:06] <innociv> I don't think it's logical at all for a variable to exist outside of a nesting.
[09:42:36] <Eviltwin> Then you don't understand how compilers work
[09:43:10] <Wiz_KeeD> can anyone please tell me how i can remove a selected option from a <select> element? i've tried it all $('#vending_machine_id option:selected').removeAttr("selected");   $('#selectmenu option').attr('selected', false);
[09:43:18] <Wiz_KeeD> nothing seems to work
[09:43:27] <sphinxxx> Eviltwin: you live up to your name well
[09:43:57] <Wiz_KeeD> any ideeas?
[09:49:45] <DreamStiffler> hi guys...this is my first jquery code: alert( $(e).closest("td").next().html() ) and i need to understand this. if i were to go to jquery site..what would i search for?
[09:50:04] <innociv> Eviltwin, I'm pretty sure that in Java and C# the scope is only in comparing nests. If I'm wrong, sorry.
[09:50:32] <NoiseEee> DreamStiffler: any/all of the jquery functions you are using:  closest(), next(), and html()
[09:50:48] <DreamStiffler> i understand the alert,the (e),the closest(maybe) and the next. but why the html?
[09:51:36] <NoiseEee> DreamStiffler: http://api.jquery.com/html/
[09:52:45] <Wiz_KeeD> can anyone please tell me how i can remove a selected option from a <select> element? i've tried it all $('#vending_machine_id option:selected').removeAttr("selected");   $('#selectmenu option').attr('selected', false);
[09:53:12] <DreamStiffler> thanks NoiseEee

[09:59:59] <Flavius1924> can you tell me why this is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/dXX5z/1/
[10:02:01] <Emn1ty> anyone know why I would get: Object function Event() { [native code] } has no method 'observe'
[10:02:43] <snover> Emn1ty: maybe because Event objects do not have a method named observe…
[10:03:04] <EpiphanyG> hey everyone :)
[10:03:39] <EpiphanyG> is there a way to add custom events to ajax events that I didn't call?
[10:03:47] <EpiphanyG> e.g. in a bookmarklet
[10:04:08] <nsfmc> member:identifier:emn1ty, i think you're looking for prototype.js which offers Event.observe
[10:05:47] <Zzaichik> Flavius1924: you aren't calling jQuery's library. And this way would be easier.  http://jsfiddle.net/dXX5z/3/
[10:07:36] <Emn1ty> nsfmc: that did it, thanks

[10:13:20] <sphinxxx> any idea why you can select the radio once here, but can't change it after selecting -  yet the radio click event is indeed firing every time, just visually not changing the radio:  https://opensky.com/p/shopopensky-test
[10:13:33] <Marco-123> hi all. im rewriting some code ive written a long time ago. ive bound some actions to the 'key-up' event of a certain control. my intention is to capture when the content of this textbox/textarea control has changed. so ive filtered out many specific key ranges. question: is there a better event to watch for for my purposes?
[10:14:54] <bambams> Is there any built-in way to easily force a particular event handler to execute first? :-/
[10:14:55] <Marco-123> sphinxxx: just guessing. but could it be that the first one is being REselected?
[10:15:18] <bambams> An ASP.NET application is firing two click events if the user double-clicks. I'm trying to figure out how to prevent the double-click ...
[10:15:51] <sphinxxx> Marco-123: would make sense, but no its not doing that
[10:16:09] <Marco-123> bambams: is there a doubleclick event? if so, an idea might be to override that and have it do nothing (return false)
[10:16:59] <gamingdroid> is there a function that converts a random string to another string that is guaranteed to be valid for use in "id attributes"?
[10:17:10] <bambams> Marco-123: Yeah, but unfortunately I can't seem to find a container object to attach the event to. /o\
[10:17:19] <bambams> Marco-123: Doing it for each button individually would be a real pain..
[10:17:58] <bambams> gamingdroid: That sounds like a very strange question. Perhaps you should tell us what you're doing instead.
[10:18:02] <Marco-123> bambams: not interested in extending the button class? i probably wouldnt be either
[10:18:04] <Eviltwin> gamingdroid: You could use a regular expression to convert all unacceptable characters to dashes or something
[10:18:28] <bambams> Marco-123: Hah, I'm not interested in touching ASP.NET any longer than necessary. :P
[10:18:35] <Marco-123> :D
[10:18:37] <nsfmc> gamingdroid, underscore.js provides a uuid function for just that
[10:20:53] <Eviltwin> nsfmc: If it just generates a UUID, I don't think that's what he's looking for
[10:21:35] <nsfmc> eviltwin, yeah, on rereading, it seems like he's looking for a hashing function
[10:21:52] <bambams> Apparently the solution consists of a random token in the session and form that changes with each successful request.
[10:22:13] <Marco-123> ah gotta boogie. later dudes
[10:23:39] <Wiz_KeeD> ngharo, it doesn't work with $('#vending_machine_id option').prop('selected',false);
[10:23:39] <Wiz_KeeD> the value stays the same
[10:24:09] <Eviltwin> I think you want to use .val() to manipulate the list of selections
[10:24:24] <ngharo> Wiz_KeeD: can you create a fiddle? see ?jsfiddle
[10:24:25] <bot-t> Wiz_KeeD, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[10:24:26] <Wiz_KeeD> i just want to empty the select box when the event is triggered
[10:25:03] <Wiz_KeeD> is removing selected supposed to remove the option from the select box?
[10:25:29] <cbobo> if I have a jQuery template, and my tempate takes in an object called 'output' and that 'output' is an array of HTML.  How do I get it to display??  {{each output}} ${$value} {{/each}} works fine, but I can't figure out how to use the {{html $value}} thanks
[10:25:41] <Eviltwin> Wiz_KeeD: You're trying to remove that option?
[10:26:29] <Wiz_KeeD> Eviltwin, on the event trigger i want to empty the selected option and display only the selected options available with that new event (the changing of another select element)\
[10:26:43] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ Wiz_KeeD
[10:26:44] <bot-t> Wiz_KeeD, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[10:26:47] <gamingdroid> bambams: I have a form, that I want to have a select box that once selected, gives me further options. To accomplish this, I'm creating the select box (called theme) on the fly, based on the values of the radio input options (called background) and inserting it into the form. To do this, I need to somehow have a unique id that translates to the set of backgrounds from the select. See example...
[10:26:48] <gamingdroid> ...here: http://dpaste.com/696690/
[10:27:38] <Wiz_KeeD> http://jsfiddle.net/VNKA7/
[10:28:46] <bambams> gamingdroid: Not quite sure I follow. Is there only ever a single select existing/visible/in use?
[10:28:56] <bambams> s/select/<select>/
[10:29:12] <Bitcrusher01> hi people
[10:29:34] <Wiz_KeeD> how's that Eviltwin ?
[10:29:38] <gamingdroid> bambams:  yes, there is only one select (that get's inserted into the form with jquery), the radio inputs are pre-generated. There is a grouping from the radio mapping to the select.
[10:30:37] <Bitcrusher01> Anyone feel like helping a JQ n00b? I'm trying to follow this http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring but I can't fgiure out how to envoke a method when the element is clicked
[10:31:21] <DerekPioneer> is there a way to add a jQuery('.product-price-1111_clone').hide() type function
[10:31:26] <DerekPioneer> where 1111 is regex for four digits?
[10:31:55] <Eviltwin> What?
[10:32:07] <DerekPioneer> ignore the hide() part
[10:32:30] <DerekPioneer> like make a jQuery class selector
[10:32:45] <Eviltwin> Make a jQuery class selector?
[10:32:47] <Eviltwin> WTF?
[10:32:48] <DerekPioneer> that selects any classes that follow the format 'product-price-FOURDIGITS_clone
[10:32:51] <DerekPioneer> jesus
[10:33:05] <DerekPioneer> it seems obvious to me
[10:33:09] <DerekPioneer> that i'm trying to select a class
[10:33:12] <DerekPioneer> with jquery
[10:33:14] <DerekPioneer> using regex
[10:33:15] <Eviltwin> If it's obvious, just do it
[10:33:34] <DerekPioneer> ok anybody else?
[10:34:06] <Eviltwin> You're using classes wrong
[10:34:10] <Raydiation> how can i get the second element of $('.' + this.box_class)
[10:34:21] <Eviltwin> Raydiation: .get(1) or .eq(1)
[10:34:28] <Eviltwin> Depending on what you're trying to accomplish
[10:34:34] <Eviltwin> Raydiation: see ?.get see ?.eq
[10:34:35] <bot-t> Raydiation, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[10:34:35] <gamingdroid> bambams: put it another way, once you use the select, a few of the radio options are revealed.
[10:34:35] <bot-t> Raydiation, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[10:34:51] <bambams> gamingdroid: Which element are you trying to generate the id for?
[10:35:04] <Raydiation> eq works
[10:35:07] <Eviltwin> DerekPioneer: You should probably have those pieces be separate classes
[10:35:14] <Eviltwin> Which will allow you to filter down first
[10:36:13] <gamingdroid> bambams: I'm trying to generate the 'class' for the radio input  buttons from the html value i.e. "Batman: Arkham Asylum", so I can show it once a select is used.
[10:36:41] <b-lew> http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/HTML/index.html#fifth is there any reason this doesnt go to the top of my page?
[10:36:54] <Eviltwin> gamingdroid: Why do you need to give it a class for that?
[10:36:54] <jbp641> Hi
[10:36:55] <bambams> gamingdroid: How are the <select> and <input type="radio" /> elements related?
[10:36:55] <enapupe> Hi, I need some help with selector/traversing.. http://jsfiddle.net/sHRJb/
[10:37:01] <Eviltwin> So you can refer to it later?

[10:37:48] <DerekPioneer> eviltwin i'm trying to do something like this: <span class="regular-price" id="product-price-2275_clone">                jQuery("span:contains('_clone')").css("display", "none");
[10:37:56] <Eviltwin> gamingdroid: Can you make one
[10:38:00] <gamingdroid> bambams: the relation is that it is a grouping. I.e. If I chose from select, "Batman: Arkham Asylum" it shows in the radio below all the options for that.
[10:38:08] <Eviltwin> DerekPioneer: see ?.filter
[10:38:09] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/

[10:38:47] <Eviltwin> DerekPioneer: Select all the elements that could have the property you're looking for, use a function to filter down to just the ones that you are interested in, and then act on it
[10:39:26] <bambams> gamingdroid: Perhaps I'm confused that there is more than one radio option for "Batman: Arkam Asylum" at all. :-/
[10:39:45] <gamingdroid> bambams: they are different background images for Batman
[10:39:58] <jbp641> hello?
[10:40:21] <bambams> gamingdroid: You could always generate indexed ids and associate them in a JavaScript data structure... You could also probably just match by the text().
[10:40:39] <bambams> gamingdroid: I'd suggest you use jsfiddle.net or another similar site to build a demo. You'll get better advice that way. :)
[10:41:23] <gamingdroid> Eviltwin: here is similar to what I'm trying to accomplish http://www.gamerhandles.com/gamercards.php
[10:41:32] <jbp641> Can someone lend a hand?
[10:42:16] <cbobo> with?
[10:42:38] <jbp641> nevermind...it just started working
[10:42:54] <jbp641> was having problems with jquery mobile in safari not going to an anchor.
[10:43:00] <jbp641> send/to/variable#step2
[10:43:11] <jbp641> maybe it was the cache or something...
[10:43:36] <cbobo> ya just use priv browser on ur mobile apple device
[10:43:38] <cbobo> that is what i do
[10:44:02] <Bitcrusher01> I'm making my first JQuery plugin, and I'm following this http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring but I can't figure out how to envoke a method when the element is clicked. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
[10:45:23] <Eviltwin> enapupe: http://jsfiddle.net/sHRJb/1/
[10:45:29] <jbp641> @cbobo it stopped working
[10:45:31] <jbp641> grumble
[10:46:30] <enapupe> Eviltwin: thanks a lot !!!
[10:46:47] <jbp641> @cbobo hmm so the anchors only start working if I reload the page after getting to it
[10:58:15] <context> is there a selector or 'easy' way to get all matching elements except the first two
[10:58:58] <nsfmc> :gt()
[10:59:09] <context> sweet! thnx
[11:03:19] <aqeel> hi room
[11:03:43] <aqeel> first stone had been laid down.....jilbreak.webege.com
[11:03:48] <aqeel> sorry
[11:03:56] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[11:04:29] <aqeel> finally i settle with html onmouseover and out getting funtion from external js file
[11:05:32] <aqeel> finally getting to move on and next big challenge is to load external content into external file while remaining in current page
[11:06:05] <aqeel> whereas this will have advanced scrolling options...
[11:07:01] <Eviltwin> It's called AJAX
[11:07:46] <aqeel> controlling scrollspeed, auto scroll onload, manually scrolling, .....i will have this setup as advance and classic modes
[11:08:30] <aqeel> btw how is my site...
[11:08:33] <poppiez> I can't remember how it's done or what it's called. I remember being able to import a JS file exposing it in the global namespace. can anyone remember?
[11:08:35] <aqeel> look and feel
[11:09:09] <Eviltwin> poppiez: <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
[11:09:11] <Eviltwin> That's how
[11:09:22] <poppiez> Eviltwin: lol wrong channel haha
[11:09:26] <b-lew> anyone have a big screen?
[11:09:35] <aqeel> how big
[11:09:44] <b-lew> 27"?
[11:09:44] <Eviltwin> Mine's a whole 800x600
[11:09:45] <aqeel> hdmi common these days
[11:10:00] <thang> something about gnu screen
[11:10:06] <Eviltwin> Ha
[11:10:31] <b-lew> http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/HTML/index.html#fifth
[11:10:42] <b-lew> if my browser is longer (ex: on a 27" )
[11:10:45] <thang> white on white
[11:10:55] <b-lew> it doesn't scroll all the way up
[11:10:58] <b-lew> I'm having a problem with my browser height effecting my last section in a parallax
[11:11:38] <aqeel> what are u achiving
[11:12:20] <aqeel> and why 4 sections?
[11:12:24] <b-lew> any help would be great
[11:12:51] <b-lew> well its going to be 4 different sections
[11:14:01] <aqeel> and are they to be shown in one go or on some event
[11:14:22] <aqeel> click load one portion, click for 2nd and follow on
[11:14:33] <b-lew> yea either that or scroll
[11:15:12] <aqeel> u can put autoscroll from jquery
[11:15:34] <aqeel> i will do that im my site sometime in next 2 days
[11:15:49] <saliak> I'm trying to programmatically submit a form multiple times (while varying one of the fields).  I'm calling $('#formid').submit() multiple times (target=_new), but it looks like the form is only getting submitted once (I only get one window with the results of the first iteration in it).  any ideas what's going on?
[11:16:16] <b-lew> that would be alright aqeel
[11:16:27] <b-lew> either way i just want it to go to the top no matter what the browser height is
[11:16:37] <aqeel> one form per page and one submit only....eith change your php for that
[11:17:23] <aqeel> you can use anchor for that in html
[11:18:03] <aqeel> b-lew pm?
[11:18:33] <b-lew> yea thats fine aqeel
[11:19:58] <b-lew> not for sure how to do that
[11:27:35] <Bitcrusher01> b-lew: just saw you message about a big screen, is it still relevant? I got a 27" with 2560x1440 res
[11:28:14] <saliak> aqeel: i'm not sure what you're talking about.  my form has a multi select that I iterate throught he values of (in javascript), and submit the form with each different value selected.  the problem is that it seems like only the first submit actually works (even though my javascript iterates through all the values).
[11:30:17] <minijupe> does jquery have a Class feature similar to Prototype?
[11:30:41] <context> jquery isnt exactly object oriented.
[11:31:02] <aqeel> <Bitcrusher01> yes u can help him
[11:31:14] <Raydiation> extend?
[11:31:42] <aqeel> salaik...please elaborate
[11:31:51] <Bitcrusher01> b-lew: you there?
[11:32:22] <Raydiation> saliak: you can submit a form only once
[11:33:48] <saliak> Raydiation: that's weird.  I don't follow why/how?  If i run my loop again, then it submits again.  it seems like there's some time period in which I can submit a form more than being able to only submit it once.
[11:34:05] <Bitcrusher01> aqeel: while I try to get b-lew's attention, can you help me out with a newbie question?
[11:34:24] <aqeel> sure
[11:34:59] <aqeel> salaik you can iterate if you submit and reload the values then submit again to appear as second instance
[11:35:54] <aqeel> but there must be some confirmation as to the submission is success
[11:35:59] <Bitcrusher01> I'm trying to follow this tutorial http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring and did this http://pastebin.com/7SPeBEUi but the last line $('#loginbutton').click(function() { gives me an error. I''m unsure how to envoke a function on .click
[11:41:25] <aqeel> The click event is only triggered after this exact series of events:      The mouse button is depressed while the pointer is inside the element.     The mouse button is released while the pointer is inside the element.
[11:41:42] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[11:42:35] <Bitcrusher01> aqeel: but when I click the button, I get this in web developer toolbar: Error: "#loginbutton".logincontrol is not a function
[11:42:36] <sethuhdiah> is there any good plugins for displaying tree data visually, possibly even in a web/cloud format
[11:43:10] <nsfmc> sethuhiah, probably overkill, but try arborjs.org
[11:43:24] <nsfmc> ugh ,sorry, sethuhdiah, arborjs.org
[11:44:18] <sethuhdiah> i like it, hopefully will work dependding on its built in options
[11:44:19] <aqeel> hey may be u missed $
[11:44:42] <saliak> aqeel: hrm. ok.  I think i've found a work around by just using window open and .serialze on my form to open windows manually
[11:44:58] <gloomer> When I load content with ajax, how do i refresh the background gradient on a div to reflect the new size
[11:44:59] <gloomer> ?
[11:45:16] <aqeel> $('#loginbutton').click(function() { 	('#loginbutton').logincontrol('loginsubmit'); });
[11:45:35] <aqeel> to $('#loginbutton').click(function() { 	$('#loginbutton').logincontrol('loginsubmit'); });
[11:46:03] <aqeel> $('#id')
[11:48:40] <gloomer> any ideas on mine aqeel?
[11:48:45] <Bitcrusher01> now the error does not appear, but nothing happens, even with $('#loginbutton').click(function() { alert('muh'); });
[11:49:26] <aqeel> use css proper and set its overflow to auto
[11:52:48] <aqeel> hey u are geting out of scope....u must get into it...bitcrusher
[11:53:49] <andrew9183> gloomer: are you accessing the DOM from your ajax call ?
[11:53:58] <aqeel> beside jquery are there any other library
[11:54:40] <andrew9183> dojo
[11:54:43] <andrew9183> sencha
[11:54:47] <andrew9183> prototype
[11:55:11] <aqeel> sorry i was asking from bit....i was answering his questions
[11:55:20] <aqeel> his problem
[11:55:33] <andrew9183> oh
[11:55:48] <andrew9183> paste a code sample http://jsfiddle.net
[11:56:41] <aqeel> http://pastebin.com/7SPeBEUi
[11:56:45] <aqeel> his problem
[11:57:09] <aqeel> <Bitcrusher01> now the error does not appear, but nothing happens, even with $('#loginbutton').click(function() { alert('muh'); });
[11:57:45] <Bitcrusher01> aqeel: what do you mean by "get into it"?
[11:58:13] <aqeel> i was asking is there any library other than jquery u using
[11:58:44] <Bitcrusher01> nope
[11:58:55] <pace_t_zulu> hey guys
[11:58:58] <aqeel> i was having the exact same problem then i come to know this irc channel and really no one helped as asked but i did get out of it...
[11:59:02] <pace_t_zulu> i'm working w ajax requests
[11:59:31] <pace_t_zulu> for some reason the data returned by the success function is returned before the completion of the ajax request
[11:59:38] <pace_t_zulu> anyone know how to get around that?
[12:00:10] <pace_t_zulu> sorry the complete function
[12:00:53] <Bitcrusher01> aqeel: thanks for looking into it, I won't waste any more of your time now, I'll dig through some more tutrials - hopefully it'll give me a revelation to JQs inner workings ;)
[12:01:12] <aqeel> use the end code in the ..........$(function(){$('#loginbutton').click(function() { 	('#loginbutton').logincontrol('loginsubmit'); });});
[12:01:34] <pace_t_zulu> the problem i'm talking about is described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3170265/jquery-ajax-enters-success-before-calling-page-finishes
[12:01:44] <pace_t_zulu> "JQuery .ajax enters Success before calling page finishes"
[12:02:13] <aqeel> put a timestamp on your call
[12:02:25] <Keeks> I'm looking to get into JQuery more and have gone thru some tutorials, can anyone recommend a tutorial that starts from scratch that has some practical examples involved?
[12:02:27] <ao5357> I have a specific question: does $.getJSON() automatically remove the script element from the DOM after it's done, or would that have to done manually?
[12:02:49] <pace_t_zulu> aqeel: was that directed at me?
[12:02:51] <aqeel> better manually
[12:02:54] <nexion> if I attach a keypress handler to a textarea, how can I consume the key press inside the handler to prevent the character from appearing in the textarea?
[12:03:06] <aqeel> yes
[12:04:07] <aqeel> all characters or specific ones
[12:04:08] <pace_t_zulu> aqeel: what will placing a timestamp on the call achieve?
[12:04:33] <aqeel> a timeout thus page loads and then your ajax callback
[12:04:43] <nsfmc> nexion, capture evt.keycode and return false, but i don't know, that feels like it'll blur the textarea rather than letting you do a cli style password input
[12:05:36] <ao5357> Before I dive into it, would .remove() work on a JSONP jqXHR object to remove the script? How else could I reference it?
[12:05:59] <aqeel> ok room got to go...bye
[12:06:13] <pace_t_zulu> aqeel:
[12:06:15] <pace_t_zulu> thanks
[12:06:27] <pace_t_zulu> anyone know what aqeel was explaining?
[12:06:32] <pace_t_zulu> i didn't quite follow him
[12:08:38] <nexion> nsfmc, that works perfectly.. ty
[12:09:12] <nsfmc> nexion, rock on
[12:10:24] <pace_t_zulu> hey guys, my .ajax() call enters the success or complete function before the call finishes
[12:11:58] <nsfmc> does anyone know of an extension to $.ui.mouse that uses $.vmouse from jQuery mobile?
[12:16:01] <JBP641> Hi Can someone help me with some issues I'm having with anchors in jquery mobile?

[12:21:40] <pace_t_zulu> eddiemonge: i see it in webkit's inspector
[12:22:07] <pace_t_zulu> the request should take a little while to complete ... but it appears to be interrupted by the jquery success call
[12:22:15] <eddiemonge> pace_t_zulu: see what? code?
[12:22:32] <eddiemonge> e-anima: what does inspector say it is?

[12:24:59] <eddiemonge> e-anima: got a link?
[12:25:19] <e-anima> hm no its local
[12:25:33] <eddiemonge> pace_t_zulu: does the data returned in the success have what its supposed to be?
[12:25:39] <eddiemonge> e-anima: jsfiddle then please
[12:25:54] <pace_t_zulu> so the original request adds a chapter to a course outline
[12:26:00] <black_warlock> guys why doesnt work this http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Pw3uq/8/
[12:26:11] <e-anima> hm its a cms. on simple basic html it would work
[12:26:15] <pace_t_zulu> the success callback returns the new outline updated with the new chapter
[12:26:20] <pace_t_zulu> eddiemonge: ^
[12:26:31] <e-anima> take a look: http://screensnapr.com/v/dz0kUE.jpg

[12:32:42] <monk12> hello all, trying to dbug this jquery ajax call to java that i think returns the appropriate html dataType [has german and chinese characters]... When you get an $.ajax call back with utf-8 html, should it show funky UTF-8 characters in the Firebug window? trying to debug.
[12:32:55] <johnkpaul> sure
[12:33:03] <johnkpaul> but you'd get a lot more help if you brought it up here
[12:33:38] <pace_t_zulu> eddiemonge: please standby
[12:33:45] <eddiemonge> do i have to?
[12:33:46] <monk12> i want to debug if jquery is getting good results back, before jquery sends the data off to the page to get populated.... the page itself has utf chars fine, its the jquery ajax call that dynamically populates soemthing else that doesnt have the funky chars
[12:34:03] <pace_t_zulu> eddiemonge: i'm going to push the code to a live server
[12:34:10] <pace_t_zulu> eddiemonge: developing locally right nowq
[12:34:12] <Zzaichik> .stats Zzaichik
[12:34:24] <eddiemonge> monk12: got a link?
[12:34:45] <monk12> eddiemonge, unfortunately no. localhost testing.
[12:35:06] <monk12> hmmm, let me think if i can create a good standalone mockup
[12:35:34] <rsumi> i have an absolutely positioned div and i want to know when the the top/left have been altered and the div is positioned somewhere else. is there an event for this or another way to detect when it's been moved?
[12:36:05] <eddiemonge> rsumi: yeah, add in a call in the place that is moving it
[12:36:07] <monk12> eddiemonge, give me 15-20m if still arolund
[12:36:43] <StevenCodes22> anyone wanan send some kewl examples my way
[12:36:45] <StevenCodes22> just bored
[12:37:20] <rsumi> eddiemonge: it can be any number of elements on the page. my div is rendered on client sites so its impossible to know everything that can move it. is there a better way?
[12:39:20] <eddiemonge> rsumi: theres a really dirty way: poll to see if the position changed
[12:41:55] <Zogot> Is there anyway, in an Object Literal to not assign anonymous functions? http://jsfiddle.net/zNBUe/ that is an anonymous function right?
[12:42:50] <Zogot> I remember a few days ago someone told me to not make them anonymous, i thought the decleration of ready: function() made it not anonymous
[12:42:53] <Zogot> but i wasn't sure
[12:42:59] <eddiemonge> Zogot: what do you mean "to not assign"? if you dont define anything then nothing will be assigned. you xcould also pass in named functions
[12:43:17] <eddiemonge> Zogot: theres nothing wrong with anon functions
[12:43:17] <Zogot> named functions inside the object literal though?
[12:43:46] <Zogot> Something about easier to debug, i remember atleast
[12:43:57] <Zogot> Is what i was told
[12:44:05] <eddiemonge> by who?
[12:44:16] <thang> well, if youre doing something and you dont know why, thats a little flawed
[12:44:23] <thang> rather told to do something
[12:44:54] <Zogot> I haven't done anything, as I didn't understood what he meant
[12:44:59] <Zogot> hence my question :p
[12:46:00] <thang> if youre familiar with lambda's, thats pretty much what youre doing with anonymous functions
[12:46:32] <Zogot> eddiemonge: Oh i can't remember now, I was looking for some feedback on one of my object literals and I remember someone saying this to me, but only since I've had some free time have I been able to think about it :p
[12:46:56] <brah> How do I focus the very same element I just left? Using a timeout doesn't feel right.
[12:48:21] <keeks> Sorry the IRC thing is new for me. I had asked about a tutorial earlier but I got logged out so not sure if anyone responded.  Sorry to bug but please repost if there is something there.  Thanks!
[12:48:21] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/aFNwA/ my old thing I posted (turns out days meant month lol, damn its gone quick)
[12:48:32] <Zogot> I think jquery keeps a log keeks
[12:49:09] <brah> http://jsfiddle.net/vsEGW/
[12:52:27] <e-anima> ok i did not solve the problem. the problem seems to be jstree: http://screensnapr.com/v/UsOllF.jpg  its has a lot of subtree menus that are set to display none. and $('.region-sidebar-first').height() outpus 1338 instead of 968)
[12:52:50] <Zzaichik> brah: tisk tisk, no multiple id's.
[12:53:00] <armenianeagle> @brah - Unique IDs
[12:53:16] <brah> Zzaichik: oops, meant type="text" on the second one, not id="field".
[12:53:38] <armenianeagle> brah - ha!
[12:54:04] <brah> http://jsfiddle.net/vsEGW/2/ I've fixed that now.
[12:55:13] <armenianeagle> brah - http://jsfiddle.net/vsEGW/3/
[12:55:37] <monk12> eddiemonge, dam, I setup the same loaded html with same utf-8 content-type in php [instead of java] and it returns fine and shows up in browser. bleh not sure what java is doing
[12:55:57] <brah> armenianeagle: We're just making it more XHTML compliant. It's still not working.
[12:56:00] <monk12> guess i'll research what exactly is being returned to jquery from java
[12:56:44] <thenior> Hey people, not a pro at javascript, so a little bit stuck. I'm trying to use the value of one array to reference another array.
[12:56:47] <thenior> http://jsfiddle.net/U9Ntu/
[12:56:55] <brah> armenianeagle: I see what you did there. That's not what I want to do.
[12:57:01] <brah> I want to focus the same field I just left, not another one.
[12:57:14] <thenior> ideally, I'd want array2 to return "46"
[12:57:32] <brah> But I am having race conditions of asynchronous nature.
[12:58:35] <thenior> #javascript
[12:58:45] <armenianeagle> brag - Oh. Sorry! #fail
[12:58:52] <brah> http://jsfiddle.net/vsEGW/4/
[12:58:53] <eddiemonge> monk12: thats why i dont lke java
[13:00:18] <eddiemonge> brah: http://jsfiddle.net/vsEGW/5/
[13:00:47] <monk12> lol. yeh its wierd i do myobject.getQuestionText() and it returns a String that looks good in Variables window, utf chars are fine... then i wrap that with "<tr>"+ text +"</tr>", set response.setEncoding("UTF-8"), and return that... and the Firebug console says header of response is UTF-8 but doesnt have those funky chars but questions marks etc. bleh!
[13:00:57] <brah> eddiemonge: Are you completely sure 1ms is enough to fix this race condition?
[13:01:27] <eddiemonge> brah: yes. because you were trying to focus before it lost focus
[13:01:44] <monk12> The german characters for some reason show up when i change the encoding from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1
[13:02:05] <monk12> but like the page itself is UTF-8 and shows the questionText in chinese/german fine.
[13:02:15] <monk12> the ajax stuff is the one that craps out heh
[13:04:31] <eddiemonge> brah: the settimeout allows the blur to do its thing then the focus can fire. but thats a pretty effed up script
[13:06:55] <Flavius1924> can you tell me why is this not working ?i want that ul to toggle when i press the text http://jsfiddle.net/dXX5z/11/
[13:07:09] <t4nkd> Is there a different attribute pseudo than 'checked' for a radio?
[13:07:37] <t4nkd> hrm, nope...
[13:07:37] <eddiemonge> no
[13:07:47] <t4nkd> yeah my bad I should've looked a :checked first
[13:07:48] <t4nkd> ty tho
[13:17:07] <brah> eddiemonge: Pretty much what I'm trying do to is check if what the user wrote in that field is correct, and if it isn't, don't let him blur.
[13:17:20] <brah> Perhaps the blur() -> focus() approach is incorrect and there's a way to stop the blur.
[13:17:35] <brunell> hi ther
[13:17:37] <brunell> e
[13:18:39] <danzik171> brah: a better way is probably a warning message next to the field, and don't allow them to submit the form.  not allowing them to lose focus just pisses off the user imo.
[13:18:49] <eddiemonge> Flavius1924: http://jsfiddle.net/dXX5z/23/
[13:19:04] <eddiemonge> Flavius1924: you either need to set the css like i did or use .toggle()
[13:19:47] <eddiemonge> brah: thats pretty mean too. why cant you add an error css class and highlight?
[13:20:14] <codythole> how can i select any divs that have an anchor child which contains a certain text?
[13:20:40] <eddiemonge> brah: but what you probably want is something like : $(ele).on('blur', function () { if ( !validate ) { e.preventDefault(); } });
[13:20:54] <eddiemonge> codythole: filter
[13:21:05] <eddiemonge> with the function looping through them
[13:21:06] <brah> eddiemonge: That's what I wanted, I can't prevent the blur when I'm already the inside the blur function.
[13:21:08] <brunell> this evening for the first time I had a look at the jqueryui site and I was wondering if anybody can give me some help
[13:21:10] <brunell> with that
[13:21:19] <danzik171> codythole: try $( "a:contains(foo)" ).parents( "div" )
[13:23:48] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/fw7wt/ Anyway to get the icons that slide out to stay when you stay over them?
[13:24:26] <brah> eddiemonge: That function() should be function(e), right?
[13:25:05] <eddiemonge> brah: yes
[13:25:10] <brunell> I dont seem to be able to use the downloadable js and css
[13:25:23] <eddiemonge> brunell: why not?
[13:25:36] <brunell> I don't know, it just doesn't work
[13:25:40] <brunell> let me tell you what I did
[13:26:06] <brunell> I have an html file called drag.htm
[13:26:21] <brunell> which is meant to be a small file to make a box draggable
[13:26:45] <brunell> and in the code I have <script type = "text/javascript"
[13:26:45] <brunell>           src = "jquery-1.3.2.min.js"></script>
[13:26:45] <brunell>   <script type = "text/javascript"
[13:26:45] <brunell>           src = "jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js"></script>
[13:26:45] <brunell>   <script type = "text/javascript">
[13:27:02] <brunell> so I went onto http://jqueryui.com/download
[13:27:11] <ngharo> OH LAWDD
[13:27:15] <brunell> chose 1.7.3 version
[13:27:21] <eddiemonge> brunell: did you read: http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started ?
[13:27:25] <snover> wow, jquery 1.3
[13:27:29] <snover> good luck with that
[13:27:51] <brunell> well, I used the 1.8.17 and it didn't make any difference
[13:28:13] <eddiemonge> it should
[13:28:15] <ringotwo> clear your cache
[13:28:18] <brah> Sure is cretaceous era in here.
[13:28:20] <eddiemonge> like a lot
[13:28:32] <brunell> but no eddiemonge, I didn't read that
[13:28:39] <brunell> I will read it and then come back
[13:28:54] <brah> I remember when I was an unicellular organism, munching on protozoa and coding on 1.3.
[13:33:51] <rsumi> idk if this is an appropiate place for plugins question but does anyone recommend a gradient/div plugin that uses modern css techniques? :)
[13:34:28] <Zzaichik> a gradient plugin..
[13:34:39] <Zzaichik> is that even necessary?
[13:35:15] <rsumi> Zzaichik: good question
[13:35:53] <Zzaichik> http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[13:36:39] <rsumi> Zzaichik: nice! thanks!
[13:38:15] <Zzaichik> np
[13:38:28] <K3|Chris> neat, cudos
[13:38:34] <K3|Chris> I've used a much crappier tool in the past
[13:40:21] <brunell> eddiemonge: thanks, I read it and it works, I think I had problems linking up the htm file with the js files
[13:40:22] <brunell> thanks
[13:40:37] <someprimetime> when using addClass/removeClass how come the css has to be chained? e.g. addClass('active') works with the css of .js-drop.active, but addClass('js-drop-active') with the css .js-drop-active doesn't?
[13:42:48] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: Are you talking about adding/removing multiple classes?
[13:43:43] <K3|Chris> warrenparsons: yeah... I don't really get it either
[13:43:44] <someprimetime> warrenparsons: i'm just adding and removing a single class called .js-drop-active
[13:43:57] <K3|Chris> that's not a very good name imo...
[13:44:18] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: I'm not understanding your description of the problem then.
[13:44:18] <someprimetime> huh?
[13:44:24] <eddiemonge> me neither
[13:44:31] <someprimetime> alright h/o… let me post a jsfiddle
[13:44:36] <eddiemonge> jsfiddle is a great way to explain
[13:45:19] <K3|Chris> someprimetime: quick tip on naming conventions for classes etc all lowercase separated by _ or large letter at the start of every new part
[13:45:32] <K3|Chris> JsDropActive or js_drop_active
[13:45:42] <eddiemonge> dashes are fine
[13:45:51] <eddiemonge> personal coding style
[13:45:52] <K3|Chris> yeah, but for some reason it's rarely used
[13:45:52] <someprimetime> K3|Chris: the naming convention we use is _ for pure css classes not used within any js
[13:46:04] <warrenparsons> K3|Chris: Personally, I hate camel case for class/ID names.
[13:46:11] <someprimetime> hyphens are used for css classes used within our js
[13:46:14] <K3|Chris> I like it for some reason... meh
[13:46:16] <someprimetime> prefixed by js of course
[13:46:28] <K3|Chris> but then again I linebreak before and after { & }
[13:46:56] <warrenparsons> K3|Chris: I prefer hyphens for class/ID, based on the edge case of dynamically constructing class names. Easier than camel case, and not as ugly as underscores :p
[13:48:47] <K3|Chris> lets just say our style.css for the site is... mixed convetions
[13:48:49] <K3|Chris> =P
[13:49:09] <K3|Chris> hypens, underscores, camelcase, different whitespace styles...
[13:49:21] <eddiemonge> i dont like underscores because they are sometimes hard to see in the inspector
[13:49:40] <codythole> danzik171: thanks!
[13:50:24] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: My prejudice against underscores is based primarily on the awkwardness of typing them, as compared to hyphens.
[13:50:54] * K3|Chris looks at warrenparsons funny
[13:51:13] <K3|Chris> they're next to each other
[13:51:23] <warrenparsons> K3|Chris: Dual-pinky typing at opposite ends of the keyboard just feels wrong.
[13:51:48] <someprimetime> ok so http://jsfiddle.net/baZ7U/
[13:52:07] <rubyruy> i vaguely recall reading something about being able to extend jquery in element-specific ways... something like $.fn.form.something = ... would make $().something() available but only for FORM elements... did i dream this? (or maybe confused it with another library... possibly Prototype)
[13:52:36] <someprimetime> that works fine how it should currently, BUT if you change in the js the addClass('active') and both removeClass('active') to addClass('drop-active') and removeClass('drop-active') it doesn't work as intended
[13:52:43] <someprimetime> even though that class is further down in the cascade
[13:53:42] <danzik171> rubyruy: doesn't work like that.  jquery.fn === the jquery prototype, it's available on all jquery collections regardless of what it is.  you could make it a no-op if it's operating on a non-form element though.
[13:54:02] <rubyruy> yeah now that i think about it there would be benefit for it really
[13:54:27] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: that argument makes no sense. underscore requires an extra keypress
[13:54:32] <rubyruy> like in theory it would just let you be more conservative about the namespace you use up but what's the point when a global method would likely override you anyway
[13:54:46] <rubyruy> and you'd have non-obvious behavior in a mixed-tag jQuery collection
[13:54:54] <rubyruy> probably dreamed it :p
[13:55:05] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: My point. Hitting shift on the left and underscore/hyphen on the right simultaneously feels wrong to my hands.
[13:55:21] <brah> eddiemonge: The DOM specification states the blur event cannot be cancelled, so cancelling it only works in Internet Explorer.
[13:55:25] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: im confused then. why do you like underscores then?
[13:55:34] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: I don't. I like hyphens.
[13:55:51] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: K3|Chris likes underscores.
[13:55:52] <eddiemonge> brah:  yeah cuz its effed up to not let people blur out of a box like i originally said
[13:56:09] <eddiemonge> im so confused
[13:56:47] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: What you describe doesn't seem to break anything.
[13:57:35] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: why dont you put what does break in there instead of telling us what to change?
[13:57:49] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Heck of an idea.
[13:58:21] <someprimetime> because it's happening when the html is rendered so it's kind of hard to see without comparing the two
[13:58:22] <someprimetime> let me take a ss
[13:58:42] <warrenparsons> What an unfortunate abbreviation...
[13:58:55] <someprimetime> an, rather
[13:59:19] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: you are making things so hard for us to figure out how to help you because no one seems to know what you are doing
[14:00:18] <thomedy> okay im trying to make a scrolling div but it stays in the content area
[14:00:28] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: check it out: when i use addClass('active') it used .drop.active … when i use addClass('drop-active') it uses .drop-active… using the former, when you first click the Helpful button, the active class immediately shows up like: http://i.imgur.com/H2jJN.png
[14:01:04] <someprimetime> when using the latter, the active class (the one above) doesn't show until you move the mouse down into the <ul> below like http://i.imgur.com/7K8Fd.png
[14:01:15] <johnkpaul> anyone in here a mockjax contributor?
[14:01:21] <thomedy> you know what i just realized i can make a div the size of the content area... and another div inside of it and htne scroll the content top
[14:01:25] <thomedy> that should work
[14:01:35] <warrenparsons> A kitten dies every time you quote a background value in CSS...
[14:01:46] <someprimetime> whatever
[14:02:16] <someprimetime> i've killed lots of kittens
[14:02:17] <danzik171> warrenparsons: that explains this pool of blood behind me then.  i was wondering about that.
[14:03:24] <ProLoser|Work> i'm gonna get really famous when i make a program that lets you screenshot reflections on your monitor
[14:03:26] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: Try it with this - http://jsfiddle.net/baZ7U/1/ Seems to work fine with either class.
[14:03:30] <ProLoser|Work> cuz i just tried to do that
[14:03:38] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: that still doesnt explain much
[14:03:51] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: I didn't change your JS at all. Just made the difference between the two CSS classes obvious. But they work as expected.
[14:04:38] <ColKurtz> hmm
[14:04:45] <ColKurtz> when you quote a background image value?
[14:04:58] <someprimetime> warrenparsons: http://jsfiddle.net/baZ7U/2/ using this one when you click on helpful it doesn't immediately turn red
[14:05:03] <someprimetime> that's what i'm trying to get at
[14:05:17] <someprimetime> you have to move into the drop down box until the change appears
[14:05:38] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: Ahh. Would have been helpful to know that was what was going wrong from the start.
[14:05:43] <someprimetime> haha sorry man
[14:05:50] <someprimetime> i should have made the color changes more obvious
[14:06:01] <someprimetime> that and i was having a brain fart trying to explain this
[14:06:51] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: Try this now http://jsfiddle.net/baZ7U/4/
[14:07:10] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: You were comparing apples to oranges: chained classes vs. standalone single class
[14:07:21] <someprimetime> ah ha!
[14:07:24] <someprimetime> dude thanks man
[14:07:25] <warrenparsons> It wasn't a JS issue. It was a CSS issue.
[14:07:38] <someprimetime> thought it had to do with some css cascade bs
[14:07:45] <someprimetime> much appreciated
[14:08:07] <someprimetime> side note, is anyone able to log into jsfiddle lately?
[14:08:16] <someprimetime> their load balancer keeps breaking for me
[14:08:20] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/baZ7U/6/
[14:08:21] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: I couldn't yesterday. Haven't tried today.
[14:08:43] <warrenparsons> I'm out. Later all.
[14:09:30] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: why use children vs siblings?
[14:09:34] <someprimetime> err vice versa
[14:10:05] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: one less call. closest().children() in your case was the same as siblings
[14:11:46] <andrew9183> O:-)
[14:11:47] <chee> coldhead: it's like 9:10am hurry up and wake up
[14:11:52] <chee> you are late for work
[14:12:13] <chee> where have all the coldheads gone? long time passing
[14:12:30] <chee> someprimetime: it gave me perblms last time i tried, too
[14:12:34] <chee> jsfiddle i mean
[14:12:37] <chee> logging in i mean
[14:13:00] <someprimetime> ah eddiemonge cool
[14:13:37] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: what is the difference in my case of using e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation() instead of using return false;
[14:17:38] <eddiemonge> return false is bad
[14:17:40] <dareign85> $("#blah").height(1); -- why isn't this changing the height?
[14:18:01] <eddiemonge> i used an analogy this week of it being a sludge hammer when hammering in nails
[14:18:32] <eddiemonge> dareign85: whats the element?
[14:19:34] <dareign85> a div
[14:20:03] <dareign85> its position:absolute;
[14:20:23] <dareign85> i'm trying to make a div look like its scrolling in
[14:20:30] <dareign85> so i using setInterval to change its height
[14:20:36] <dareign85> tyring to start it at 0
[14:21:17] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: but what conflicts can it introduce?
[14:21:42] <min|dvir|us> I have `var a = $(this_is_a_selector)`. Given `a`, can I get `$('.other-class ' + this_is_a_selector)`?
[14:21:48] <eddiemonge> dareign85: why not use slideDown() ?
[14:21:56] <dareign85> hmmm
[14:22:00] <dareign85> ill check it out
[14:22:11] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: unexpected ones
[14:22:43] <sheraz> any backbonejs users here?
[14:22:52] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: is "a" a parent or child of other class?
[14:23:01] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge: child.
[14:23:12] <someprimetime>  ಠ_ಠ
[14:23:55] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: what is it you are trying to do? if you have "a" and its a child, then that second query would return a
[14:24:03] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge: I have all elements of a certain variety; I want to narrow them down to make sure each has a parent with class other-class.
[14:24:09] <dareign85> do i have to display:none for that to work?
[14:24:28] <sheraz> /help/command
[14:24:32] <sheraz> sorry
[14:24:41] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: then look at .filter() .has() or is()
[14:24:54] <eddiemonge> dareign85: no, itll do it for you
[14:25:45] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge: backwards.
[14:26:00] <min|dvir|us> I have elements.
[14:26:17] <min|dvir|us> Now, from those elements, I want only those that have a parent with class other-class.
[14:26:24] <xmaddness> Is there a way via chrome console to get the value of a var? Like via jQuery.fn.functionName.var ?
[14:26:46] <mansoor> yah
[14:26:56] <mansoor> xmaddness, just type in the variable name
[14:27:03] <xmaddness> hrmm, okay
[14:27:04] <min|dvir|us> He probably means the name.
[14:27:07] <min|dvir|us> Oh wow.
[14:27:11] <xmaddness> No I mean the value
[14:27:19] <mansoor> yah just typed it in there
[14:27:41] <pifantastic> xmaddness: no
[14:27:41] <mansoor> it wil lwork IF it is accessable
[14:27:46] <pifantastic> xmaddness: at least not that way
[14:27:48] <mansoor> if its declared inside the functions, then it wont work
[14:27:56] <xmaddness> well this is a property of an object
[14:28:04] <min|dvir|us> mansoor: use the word 'closure' in there. :)
[14:28:24] <mansoor> closure = type of function :)
[14:28:25] <xmaddness> I assume I can access closures
[14:28:28] <min|dvir|us> I have a collection of elements. I want to get only those with a certain parent. How?
[14:28:32] <min|dvir|us> I want the opposite of .has().
[14:29:07] <mansoor> min|dvir|us, write a loop and test for its parent
[14:29:15] <min|dvir|us> That's disgusting.
[14:29:30] <mansoor> min|dvir|us, or write a better selector
[14:31:24] <dareign85> is it possible to slide 2 things at the same time? i have a div ontop of a button..i want the div to push the button down
[14:31:31] <dareign85> but just the button, and not other elements
[14:31:41] <dareign85> i have to set them both to positon:absolute right
[14:32:06] <Barbaren> hello
[14:32:32] <Barbaren> I've got a div wrapped in a bigger position:absolute div, i want to bind a click function to the larger div, but don't want it to fire when the inner div is clicked... how can i prevent this behaviour?
[14:32:35] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: $(eles).filter(function() { return $(this).closest('selector').length === 1 })
[14:32:45] <gamingdroid> Is there a way to use the html() text for selection? See example here: http://dpaste.com/696782/
[14:33:25] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge: that's pretty nice.
[14:33:26] <min|dvir|us> Thanks.

[14:42:22] <moesti> mybe its the same
[14:46:41] <moesti> ok its a bug
[14:51:10] <h1ll37> why does this code work but when i replace "$(document).keyup" with "$(".message").keyup" it won't work anymore? http://pastie.org/private/39ppuzrencah3zufo3bukw
[14:53:49] <eddiemonge> works just fine http://jsfiddle.net/8G88u/
[14:55:49] <chovy> h1ll37: is .message in the dom at the time you define the event handler?
[14:57:19] <h1ll37> chovy: well i'm calling it on $(document).ready()
[14:57:38] <eddiemonge> not in that example you werent
[14:58:03] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: oops... haha. thanks man lol
[14:58:53] <chovy> h1ll37: $(fn); is a short cut for $(document).ready(fn);
[15:00:00] <h1ll37> chovy: when do you call document.ready; instead of document.read(function() {?
[15:00:22] <chovy> i just put $(fn) at the bottom of the page.
[15:00:38] <chovy> $(fn); is the same as $(document).ready(fn);
[15:01:36] <someprimetime> hey eddiemonge why did you add e.preventDefault() to $drop.click()?
[15:02:02] <someprimetime> whoops on http://jsfiddle.net/baZ7U/6/
[15:02:13] <rabidsnail> Is it just me or does .contents() die when it finds an iframe that isn't in the main dom tree?
[15:02:42] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: because if you dont itll try to go to anchor #. basically anytime i use click on an achor with a href, i do preventDefault
[15:02:55] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: ah ok thanks
[15:03:09] <eddiemonge> Is it just me or does browsers die when it finds an inframe in the dom tree?
[15:03:22] <rabidsnail> what?
[15:04:38] <rabidsnail> $.fn.contents assumes that contentDocument or contentWindow is defined for all iframe tags
[15:04:51] <rabidsnail> and throws an exception when that's not the case
[15:05:08] <rabidsnail> At least that's true in the current stable version
[15:06:08] <rabidsnail> And at least in firefox that happens whenever you have a dom subtree that's not attached to the main dom tree which contains an iframe
[15:12:17] <someprimetime> ls
[15:12:20] <someprimetime> whoops shit
[15:12:56] <mdiamond> anyone have a suggestion for a hashchange polyfill for IE6/7 with Chrome Frame
[15:13:52] <pifantastic> mdiamond: I think ben alaman's bbq has one
[15:13:57] <pifantastic> ?g ben alman bbq
[15:13:58] <bot-t> pifantastic, Ben Alman  jQuery BBQ: Back Button & Query Library - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[15:14:08] <mdiamond> yeah we're already using his hashchange plugin
[15:14:17] <pifantastic> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/files/jquery-ba-bbq-js.html#hashchange_event(BBQ)
[15:14:18] <pifantastic> ah
[15:14:21] <mdiamond> but it hasn't been tested with Chrome Frame and we're running into problems
[15:14:32] <mdiamond> might be our code but it just doesn't seem to be working
[15:16:13] <gamingdroid> any expert out there know if you can write a selector that matches the content of a label tag, i.e. match "abc def" of "<label>abc def</label>"?
[15:16:30] <ngharo> ?contains
[15:16:30] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[15:17:30] <gamingdroid> ngharo: thank you! than you! :D
[15:25:01] <Zerxer> quick question, what's the difference between ajaxPrefilter and ajaxSend?
[15:25:57] <pifantastic> Zerxer: Prefilter let's you modify Ajax options
[15:26:50] <Zerxer> great, that's what I want to do. wasn't sure if ajaxSend would too
[15:34:35] <gamingdroid> is there a way to ensure that the :contains selector only matches text that the entire text is matched within and nothing else, i.e exact match?
[15:34:56] <Zzaichik> ===
[15:35:32] <ploo> How do I disable a jquery plugin on something?
[15:36:07] <ploo> $("select").plugin();
[15:36:11] <ploo> how do I undo that?
[15:40:56] <ngharo> ploo: uhhhhh
[15:42:07] <ploo> hmm
[16:01:50] <Zerxer> if I set a default value for url in ajax settings, could I just do like $.ajax(null  to have it use the default?
[16:03:33] <pifantastic> ?tias @ Zerxer
[16:03:34] <bot-t> Zerxer, Try It And See
[16:04:51] <pifantastic> Zerxer: browsing through the code, it looks like the answer is yes
[16:05:11] <pifantastic> s.url = ( ( url || s.url ) + "" ).replace( rhash, "" ).replace( rprotocol, ajaxLocParts[ 1 ] + "//" );
[16:06:00] <Zerxer> alright, thanks
[16:06:40] <Zerxer> completely redoing our site so trying to set up a main ajax handler to cut down on repeat code
[16:15:17] <babonk> Is there a difference between $('#whatever').on('click', function(){} and $('#whatever').click(function(){ ?
[16:16:56] <starsinmypockets> I'm new to JS/JQ development and am trying to grasp best practices / good patterns...
[16:17:44] <starsinmypockets> I find myself passing a lot of data around in html tags (eg <div class = 'foo' current-vol-id=62>') and then passing this back to php functions via ajax....
[16:18:12] <adoven> babonk: don't think so.
[16:18:12] <starsinmypockets> I know it's a bit vague but is this a familliar pattern to more seasoned devs out there?
[16:19:09] <Zerxer> starsinmypockets: I do this a lot, but I would say to use the data attributes instead. data-current-vol-id="62"
[16:19:10] <starsinmypockets> Or any recommendations of a good book / resource dealing specifically with good design patterns / clean code in Javascript / PHP web apps?
[16:19:27] <Zerxer> starsinmypockets: then you can do $(".foo").data('current-vol-id') to fetch/set the value
[16:19:41] <Zerxer> (if you're using HTML5 doctype)
[16:19:57] <starsinmypockets> Zerxer - is that safe cross-browser?
[16:20:22] <Zerxer> I believe they are, but data attributes only work with HTML5 that I know of
[16:20:48] <Zerxer> the use of the data attribute is just if you need the main PHP to add the data to the element when you're first creating the page
[16:21:13] <Zerxer> if the value won't even be added until later with javascript then you don't need the data attribute, just use jquery's .data() still and it'll do what it's always done (and doesn't need html5 for it)
[16:21:38] <Zerxer> but if you have a data attribute set, jquery will use it for the original value I guess
[16:25:03] <olarf> Hello
[16:25:06] <olarf> i would like to animate from one color into another
[16:25:19] <olarf> do i need to download a plugin?
[16:25:37] <olarf> $(this).find("a").animate( { color: 'black' }, 1000).animate( { color: 'pink' }, 1000);
[16:25:46] <olarf> is something wrong with that line?
[16:25:54] <starsinmypockets> olarf: checkout jquery
[16:25:55] <coldhead> ?g jquery color plugin github
[16:25:57] <bot-t> coldhead, jquery/jquery-color - GitHub - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[16:26:57] <olarf> is there a perma-link for this plugin?
[16:27:13] <olarf> or do i just have to place it in my js folder
[16:27:55] <coldhead> olarf: you could hotlink to github
[16:28:03] <coldhead> but that could break if they update it
[16:28:11] <coldhead> better to keep a local copy that's known good
[16:28:21] <olarf> ok thanks
[16:28:22] <coldhead> then it shouldn't break in your sleep
[16:29:17] <olarf> hmm do i really need those 600 lines of additional code?
[16:29:34] <coldhead> that's a matter for yourself
[16:29:54] <Eviltwin> Think of it this way
[16:30:04] <Eviltwin> When it's minified, it'll probably be one or two lines
[16:30:49] <olarf> ok i will try it out
[16:30:53] <olarf> thanks a lot
[16:32:37] <fission6> how can i dynamically add values to a form?
[16:32:55] <fission6> like have a drop down and a user selects add, and it gets pushed to a multivalue form
[16:35:21] <coldhead> var newThing = $('#newthing').val(); $('select).append('<option>' + newThing + '</option>')
[16:43:24] <tazrover> How could I use JS to create a text editor like the ones on http://jsfiddle.net/ ?  Would appreciate any advice/recommendations..

[16:47:01] <Eviltwin> https://github.com/akzhan/jwysiwyg
[16:47:08] <Eviltwin> That's how
[16:49:11] <tazrover> great, thanks!  ill take a look..
[16:55:32] <ipalaus> there is anyway to bind a "click" action to a #foo IF is NOT on #bar? <div id="foo">aaa<div id="bar">bbb</div>
[16:56:43] <Eviltwin> You can stop the propagation on bar or use .is to check if the event.target is #bar
[16:57:35] <ipalaus> mmm how can be the propagation stoped? I usually did e.preventDefault(); but this inside a concrete .click() function
[16:57:43] <ipalaus> gonna cehck is()
[16:58:03] <ipalaus> ok seems easy with is() :)!
[16:58:04] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[16:58:16] <Eviltwin> .is is probably the better solution
[16:58:23] <ipalaus> perfect, thank you Eviltwin !
[17:11:56] <olarf> i have one more question for today
[17:12:01] <olarf> :(
[17:12:13] <olarf> when i do hovering an image
[17:12:31] <olarf> no lets say a link
[17:13:33] <olarf> i have an animation realized with the .hover() function
[17:14:22] <olarf> and if i move my mouse quickly over the link and drag it out aggain for multiple times in a row
[17:14:35] <olarf> it hovers as many times as i did it
[17:15:09] <olarf> can anyone tell my how to stop the "last" animation
[17:23:42] <ColKurtz> olarf, maybe hoverIntent will help: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[17:37:01] <kba_> I've used $.getJSON(..., ..., function(data) { ... }
[17:37:11] <kba_> now, how do I count the number of entries in data?
[17:37:33] <kba_> I know I can iterate over them using $.each(data, ...), but that seems silly
[17:37:56] <kba_> if the set is empty, I can call data.length and I get 0, but if it isn't empty, I just get undefined
[17:57:00] <rsumi_> is there a way to select to elements at once by 2 different ids? ie: jQuery('#id1 #id2')
[17:59:52] <shakakai> rsumi_: $("#id1, #id2")
[18:00:10] <shakakai> rsumi_: just like you would style them together in css
[18:01:08] <rsumi_> shakakai: gotcha... i notice also jquery allows you to gain access to a jquery object by passing an element into it... is there a way to pass 2 elements into it?
[18:03:10] <shakakai> rsumi_: $([document.getElementById("id1"), document.getElementById("id2")])
[18:03:16] <shakakai> rsumi_: that works
[18:03:27] <rsumi_> shakakai: perfect!!!! thank you so much
[18:03:29] <shakakai> rsumi_: just pass them as an array
[18:03:32] <shakakai> np
[18:16:31] <patrick99e99> hey jquery home skillets!  Got a question for ya'll...  if I just want to test the existance of something on the page, is there a more elegant way than doing $('.foo').length > 0 ?
[18:17:34] <kborchers> patrick99e99: just $('.foo').length is good enough since 0 is "falsey" and >0 is "truthy"
[18:18:05] <patrick99e99> no nice method that returns a boolean?
[18:19:04] <kborchers> not that i can think of ... every method that comes to mind ends up checking length
[18:19:14] <patrick99e99> kborchers: ok, thanks a million!
[18:19:16] <patrick99e99> or a billion!

[19:17:18] <chrisinajar> *mysql
[19:17:20] <chrisinajar> lol
[19:19:55] <pdm1113_> the php file is already on the server and sending out a rating of 1 for testing purpose
[19:20:08] <pdm1113_> this is what i have of the jquery so far
[19:20:10] <pdm1113_> $(document).ready(function() {     $("#newid").change(function () { // or whichever event you're watching       var value = $(this).val();         var photoid = $("#photoid").val();         $.post("protected/views/reviews/photo_rating.php", {photoid: ""+photoid+"", rating: ""+rating+""}, function(data) {             if (data==1)                     // success; reload maybe             else                     // error here          }
[19:20:33] <pdm1113_> would pay pall some modestly if they could help me conect the dots
[19:27:42] <Bankzilla> pdm1113_ you dont need "" infront or behind photoid
[19:35:42] <DreamStiffler> hi, im new to js and as well as jquery
[19:36:08] <DreamStiffler> i tried this and able to achieve the first td text. : alert( $(e).closest("td").next().html() )
[19:36:34] <DreamStiffler> but i need to get the remaining text in the remaining td in the row. i tried nextAll and nextUntil but doesnt seem to work
[19:36:42] <DreamStiffler> maybe ive coded it wrong
[19:36:49] <DreamStiffler> any help here?
[19:39:02] <Bankzilla> DreamStiffier you can setup a loop and run it over and over for the number of children
[19:46:55] <DreamStiffler> pardon my coding knowledge but do you mean alert each time it detects?
[19:47:39] <llab8ks> can anyone reccommend a good current book on javascript in general for someone already coming from a strong programming background and is somewhat familiar with the language but wants a better grasp of the fundamentals/best practices specific to js?
[19:48:41] <Bankzilla> DreamStiffier alert's are bad for debugging, use console.log
[19:49:00] <Bankzilla> @DreamStiffier ?console
[19:49:17] <Bankzilla> @DreamStiffier ?console.log
[19:49:26] <Bankzilla> err wtf why isn't it working
[19:51:14] <DreamStiffler> where can i check this alert logs from?
[19:51:23] <DreamStiffler> i mean the logs
[19:54:00] <DreamStiffler> obviously its not on the tomcat console
[19:54:32] <spiffie> if you're using Firefox, get the Firebug plugin. if you use Chrome, you can use the Web Inspector's console.
[19:59:20] <civilordergone> anyone know any examples of scrolling down, and querying more of the page
[19:59:56] <DreamStiffler> i have firebug
[20:00:13] <ch3mical> civilordergone: huh?
[20:00:33] <civilordergone> ch3mical: like when you scroll down on turmblr, more images get populated
[20:00:40] <civilordergone> when you reach the bottom
[20:00:43] <civilordergone> it shoots off an event
[20:02:00] <DreamStiffler> but how does the code goes for this console log? console.log(functionname(e)) >
[20:02:03] <DreamStiffler> >?
[20:02:50] <spiffie> http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API

[20:07:04] <civilordergone> anyoneee?
[20:07:39] <makiiren> quick question, is there a simple way to do the following: Replace a div with a ul while leaving the innerHtml intact? (will also be replacing more inner div's with li
[20:07:40] <llab8ks> you can use console.log, console.error, console.warn, console.debug
[20:07:53] <llab8ks> and you can pipe the output to a file
[20:07:59] <llab8ks> or stderr/out
[20:08:01] <llab8ks> whatever
[20:08:45] <llab8ks> if you want actual log files, you need to pipe the output of your error/debugging messages into a file
[20:09:07] <eddiemonge> makiiren: no
[20:09:08] <DreamStiffler> ok i see the console log
[20:09:19] <DreamStiffler> all it shows that my actions of clicking the checkbox
[20:09:21] <eddiemonge> ?replacewith @ makiiren

[20:09:35] <DreamStiffler> it doesnt return any values that i would achieve with alert

[20:09:42] <DreamStiffler> knowledge
[20:10:04] <Eviltwin> makiiren: var mydiv = $("#mydiv"), kids = mydiv.contents(), myul = $("<ul>"); mydiv.replaceWith(myul); myul.append(kids);

[20:18:57] <fission6> how can i use jquery to select an item from an option dropdown
[20:24:19] <DreamStiffler> almost did it..just read the debugging console thing
[20:24:23] <DreamStiffler> coolness
[20:24:57] <DreamStiffler> i used nextAll and it shows in console.log but not in alert which cool that i have learned this
[20:25:38] <DreamStiffler> but now the problem is in my function . it seems its collecting the td tags as well. which api can u sugest?
[20:25:42] <DreamStiffler> if any
[20:25:47] <DreamStiffler> im still surfing jquery for this
[20:33:21] <DreamStiffler> looks like by using .html()
[20:33:36] <DreamStiffler> but when i do it only generates the first td
[20:36:39] <Anphonic> var $divCon = $('div.[class^="apmd"]').contents();
[20:37:00] <Anphonic> that should set divCon to the contents to the div with the supplied class correct?
[20:38:10] <saddishwasher> evening all!
[20:39:05] <Anphonic> good evening :)
[20:39:11] <ngharo> Anphonic: no
[20:39:16] <ngharo> you dont need the dot
[20:40:13] <Anphonic> .class or .contents()
[20:40:56] <ngharo> $('div[class^="apmd"]')
[20:40:58] <saddishwasher> I'm looking for the most efficient way to append a collection of jquery nodes to the DOM within a for loop.  I realize calling $('body').append( $(myitem) ) within each iteration is expensive.  So how can I do this effectively?
[20:41:27] <ngharo> not sure why you're wanting "classes that start with apmd".  seems yucky.
[20:41:40] <saddishwasher> p.s. without using string notation (i.e. "<div id='myitem'/>" )
[20:42:09] <Anphonic> well, it is to be honest
[20:42:10] <ngharo> saddishwasher: assemble the string in your loop, then append after
[20:43:28] <saddishwasher> ngharo, I can't assemble it via string because I need to bind an event listener on each node.  Therefore each iteration node would have to look like $('#myitem').bind('click', myFunction)
[20:43:34] <Anphonic> it's a dynamically created class, all start with apmd, then a random string. What I'm attemping to do it convert the parent div to a UL, then the child div's to LI, and leave the content of the child divs intact.
[20:44:23] <ngharo> saddishwasher: that is what classes are for
[20:44:41] <ngharo> Anphonic: you're using a classname as an id
[20:44:54] <ngharo> Anphonic: use id for the unique, and give them all a common class
[20:45:04] <DreamStiffler> .text() yessss thank you ALL!
[20:45:20] <Anphonic> ngharo: quickest, dirtiest way. it's an imported rss feed.
[20:45:42] <Edler> any talender web designer here ?
[20:46:00] <saddishwasher> ngharo, is there a way to accomplish my goal or not? I'm not looking for work arounds, I'm looking for a way to accomplish what I asked

[20:52:40] <saddishwasher> ngharo, I've tried using classes before and it does not respond well (I'm using jqtouch library).  I'm purely looking for an efficient way to append nodes to the dom http://pastebin.com/uDnCaKDb
[20:53:01] <ngharo> Anphonic: so your backend I assume is writing out the HTML?
[20:53:48] <Anphonic> ngharo: Correct, an RSS feed being read into mysql DB, then html being written out.
[20:54:23] <Anphonic> rather than fight to modify it on import, I've taken the road to modifying it on output.
[20:55:14] <ngharo> saddishwasher: efficient means writing to the dom as few times as possible
[20:55:27] <saddishwasher> ngharo, right
[20:55:28] <ngharo> saddishwasher: is tid unique in that case?
[20:55:41] <saddishwasher> tid is unique to each iteration
[20:56:33] <Anphonic> trying to convert div with the parent with class apmd* into ul: the direct children into li. Leaving the divs (and children) with  <div class="ap_pht* intact
[20:57:43] <Anphonic> yes, very convoluted I know
[20:59:08] <ngharo> saddishwasher: this is how i'd do it: http://jsfiddle.net/madAx/
[21:00:33] <ngharo> saddishwasher: http://jsfiddle.net/madAx/1/ oops
[21:01:19] <saddishwasher> ngharo, like I said, using the class the bind my event is not working.  Some bug in jqtouch.  What DOES work is binding the listener when I create the element (what I posted originally)
[21:02:26] <ngharo> saddishwasher: that's odd.  is it possible you're trying to bind to an empty object?  have you console.log'd the selector when it's failing?
[21:02:46] <ngharo> saddishwasher: class selector is uhh, a very important thing
[21:03:03] <saddishwasher> ngharo, I can't console.log anything because my function doesn't even get entered into
[21:04:25] <ngharo> results comes from an ajax call i assume?
[21:05:23] <saddishwasher> ngharo, would something like this work? http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2281-jQuery-Appends-Multiple-Elements-Using-Efficient-Document-Fragments.htm
[21:07:00] <saddishwasher> using document.createElement instead of document.createTextNode
[21:09:07] <saddishwasher> ngharo, this is a phonegap app for iOS so results actually come from an iOS localhost SQLite database query

[21:13:54] <ngharo> saddishwasher: can you try my example out?  have you?
[21:14:23] <saddishwasher> I did you example first, before I even got into this room.  That was my first thought too
[21:14:24] <vsmith> hello
[21:14:43] <ngharo> saddishwasher: why don't we try and figure out why thats not working?
[21:15:07] <vsmith> hey guy crazy question.  is there a way to use php inside of a jquery file?
[21:15:14] <ngharo> in my example, console log $('li.foobar') immediately before binding to it
[21:15:32] <ngharo> i'm betting it's empty in your case, in which case we narrowed down the problem
[21:15:47] <saddishwasher> ngharo, ok let me try
[21:15:52] <ngharo> (that i also know the solution too!)
[21:15:56] <vsmith> like this
[21:15:58] <vsmith> $('#comment-form-trigger').tipTip({
[21:15:58] <vsmith> 			content: "<div id='actual-comment-form'>" + <?php comment_form(); ?> + "</div>",
[21:15:58] <vsmith> 			defaultPosition: "top",
[21:15:58] <vsmith> 			delay:50
[21:15:58] <vsmith> 		});
[21:16:26] <ngharo> vsmith: next time use jsfiddle or pastebin.  see ?p
[21:16:27] <bot-t> vsmith, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:16:28] <vsmith> i know its really sill y
[21:16:38] <vsmith> okay sorry
[21:16:49] <saddishwasher> ngharo, so console.log before the .on function?
[21:16:55] <ngharo> saddishwasher: yeah
[21:17:01] <vsmith> any help her
[21:17:03] <vsmith> here
[21:17:36] <ngharo> vsmith: if it's .php file, sure
[21:17:52] <vsmith> it;s not
[21:17:58] <ngharo> then nope
[21:18:06] <vsmith> trying to figure this out
[21:19:04] <Anphonic> hrmm, wierd things goin on here
[21:19:30] <ngharo> Anphonic: yeah sorry lots going on there.  i didnt quite follow.
[21:20:09] <Anphonic> ngharo: not a problem, trying to figure out my foreach loop i'm going to need
[21:20:27] <ngharo> Anphonic: but looking at your fiddle I stand by changing class to id, and then give a common classname i.e. class="apmd" instead
[21:20:51] <ngharo> it'll increase performance significantly
[21:20:58] <Anphonic> can't do that, at least not without rewriting it before rewriting it lol
[21:21:04] <ngharo> those nifty attr starts with, etc, selectors are costly
[21:21:36] <saddishwasher> ngharo, ok, I'm not seeing anything being consoled
[21:21:39] <saddishwasher> *logged
[21:21:42] <Anphonic> oh yeah I know, but since it's sent to us with no ID
[21:22:27] <ngharo> saddishwasher: ok so it sounds like that .on() call is happening before that content is in the dom
[21:22:54] <Anphonic> not so worried about the speed of the site as of yet, more worried about getting is displaying right. we've already cleared a huge hurrdle and are only 32 days behind schedule
[21:23:01] <saddishwasher> ngharo, my function is inside a document.ready
[21:23:16] <ngharo> try $(document).on('click', 'li.foobar', function() { ... })
[21:23:39] <saddishwasher> and is inside a linked js file that resides AFTER the linked js file that appends the elements to the DOM
[21:24:13] <ngharo> saddishwasher: what about your db call though?  i have no idea about ios sqlite or whatever, but i'm guessing it's asyncronous
[21:24:33] <ngharo> try that on() call above
[21:24:59] <saddishwasher> ngharo, is .on() replacing click?
[21:25:08] <saddishwasher> no no, .on() replaces .bind
[21:25:17] <saddishwasher> nvm
[21:25:36] <ngharo> yeah it's the new bind/delegate/live/etc
[21:28:10] <ngharo> jquery 1.7 btw
[21:29:27] <AlmondButter> Hi query room… I have two questions.  (1) is it possible to create a *responsive* (screen, tablet, mobile) jquery slider (like those sliding image gallery sliders that are everywhere) that displays not just images, but also little movie clips/ other media?
[21:29:28] <Anphonic> what's more fun, working with multiple components using jq 1.3.2, 1.6.4, mootools, their own proprietary js
[21:29:42] <AlmondButter> and my second question 2) For the above slider, is it possible to have some of the data displayed on the slideshow (be they images or movies) hooked up to a server database and have it update/render live as the database changes?
[21:29:56] <ngharo> Anphonic: :(
[21:30:06] <saddishwasher> ngharo, check my update at the bottom: http://jsfiddle.net/madAx/2/
[21:30:24] <Anphonic> ngharo: imagine trying to build cnn in 2 weeks.
[21:30:39] <Anphonic> using joomla
[21:30:46] <ngharo> Anphonic: *kills self*
[21:30:48] <saddishwasher> ngharo, arent they the same thing?
[21:30:51] <Anphonic> :P
[21:30:56] <ngharo> saddishwasher: nope
[21:31:04] <Anphonic> hence 32 days behind schedule
[21:31:06] <saddishwasher> ngharo, how are they not
[21:31:15] <ngharo> the working syntax relies on event bubbling
[21:31:42] <AlmondButter> let me know please, if anyone knows
[21:31:57] <ngharo> the tap event is actually being bound to document, which checks the event.target === 'li.project', then executes the function
[21:32:30] <ngharo> ?ajax101
[21:32:30] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[21:32:41] <ngharo> check that out, probably explains it better than I can
[21:32:56] <ngharo> but there is obviously some async calls happening, probably to your DB
[21:33:17] <saddishwasher> crazy stuff man, at least it works now
[21:33:20] <saddishwasher> ngharo, thank you
[21:33:31] <ngharo> the second syntax just is looking for 'li.project' inside of body at the time of execution
[21:33:36] <Anphonic> ngharo: only 2 of us know what we're doing. But our coding ability is mainly limited to minor edits and fixes.
[21:34:03] <ngharo> saddishwasher: some more info on this see ?delegate
[21:34:04] <bot-t> saddishwasher, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[21:34:05] * Anphonic is ready for this project to be F I N I S H E D!
[21:36:41] <ngharo> ?jcarousel @ AlmondButter
[21:36:45] <bot-t> AlmondButter, plugins.jquery.com - jCarousel is a jQuery plugin for controlling a list of items in horizontal or vertical order. The items, which can be static HTML content or loaded with (or without) AJAX, can be scrolled back and ... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jcarousel
[21:36:56] <ngharo> that's a popular one, dunno if it satifies all your requirements but worth checking out
[21:37:39] <Anphonic> jCarousel is nice, it's actually what I'm looking at using, once I get these divs converted to uls
[21:39:59] <AlmondButter> thanks guys!
[21:40:49] <ngharo> Anphonic: can you wrap the div in <ul><li> instead?  see ?wrap
[21:40:50] <bot-t> Anphonic, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[21:41:25] <ngharo> or maybe just change css display to inline
[21:41:30] <AlmondButter> carousel looks promising.  i visited the examples page but didn't see any description about it being able to hold more than one media type.  it certainly can pull content ajax, but I'm not sure if it can pull content from deep within a database that is constantly changing.  Furthermore, it is not responsive, but I think it can be tweaked so it can be responsive.
[21:42:07] <intellilogic> .find(':input:not([type="button"][name="lbltr_managed"][name="foo1"][name="foo2"])')   is there a better way to select many name properties than typing name=foo for each?
[21:43:35] <ngharo> intellilogic: can you modify the markup?
[21:44:37] <Anphonic> ngharo: hmm, you might have something there, now that I think about it
[21:45:01] * Anphonic talks to himself and ponders
[21:45:13] <destryalhmns> from the docs Multiple Selector (selector1, selector2, selectorN) ???
[21:45:32] <ngharo> destryalhmns: ???
[21:45:59] <destryalhmns> idk
[21:46:22] <ngharo> $('div, img, input')
[21:46:28] <ngharo> all divs, images, and inputs
[21:46:59] <Cork> intellilogic: that selector is about as inefficient as it can be, it will actaully select and loop over every element on the page
[21:47:12] <Anphonic> so i convert the parent div to ul, write the content back into it, wrap each "naked" div in an li and presto?
[21:47:19] <ngharo> topic of the night: use classes!!
[21:47:34] <Cork> :input is a function, so its feed each element selected with *
[21:47:50] <ngharo> Anphonic: worth a shot?
[21:47:59] <Anphonic> ngharo: on it :)
[21:48:46] <Cork> intellilogic: these two does the same thing:
[21:48:48] <Cork> .find(':input:not([type="button"][name="lbltr_managed"][name="foo1"][name="foo2"])')
[21:48:54] <Cork> .find('*').filter(':input').not('[type="button"][name="lbltr_managed"][name="foo1"][name="foo2"]')
[21:49:24] <Anphonic> targeting only the unclassed/id'd divs hrmm
[21:51:57] <ngharo> i feel dirty typing this after what Cork said
[21:52:06] <ngharo> .not('[id], [class]')
[21:53:04] <Cork> i just mean be carefull about using :<something> as main selectors
[21:53:25] <Anphonic> Cork: you should see how I have to do my selecting atm
[21:53:47] <Anphonic> ngharo: http://jsfiddle.net/FAbpY/3/
[21:53:50] <Anphonic> :D
[21:54:14] <Anphonic> it might still be ugly but know what? they're all in a ul
[21:54:22] <ngharo> oh lawdy
[21:54:33] * Anphonic goes to test on a the production site
[21:54:34] <Cork> Anphonic: ya i've written som frightning selectors my self, but thats only if the speed of them doesn't matter (nnly used once or smething like that)
[21:54:53] <Cork> *only
[21:55:26] <Eviltwin> It'd be cool if for the pseudo selectors that represent a collection of QSA selectors, it would just translate and pass to QSA
[21:55:36] <ngharo> Anphonic: you got <ul><div><li>
[21:55:39] <ngharo> thats no good
[21:55:53] <Cork> Eviltwin: ya it would
[21:56:05] <Anphonic> doh, missed that in my excitement
[21:56:54] <Cork> Eviltwin: and if all browsers could support :any (renamed, but dont remember the new term) it would be even nicer
[21:57:11] <BryanRuiz1> hi, im working with a site that has both prototype and jquery.  I ran jQuery.noConflict(); and tried accessing jQuery as "jQuery("#something");"  but it keeps telling me that jQuery is undefined
[21:57:29] <Cork> Eviltwin: ah its renamed to :matches()
[21:57:46] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/:-moz-any
[21:58:05] <Cork> i long for that selector >_>
[21:58:36] <Eviltwin> Still
[21:58:43] <Eviltwin> The translation would improve present performance
[21:58:53] <Cork> ya
[21:58:53] * Anphonic cheers
[21:58:55] <Eviltwin> I'n not sure if :any would make a big performance difference for a smart selector engine
[21:59:01] <Eviltwin> Just in terms of writing the selectors
[21:59:03] * Anphonic hugs ngharo
[21:59:15] <Eviltwin> I'm sure some engines would just flatten them anyway
[21:59:18] <Anphonic> Anyone care to see if in action on a real article?
[21:59:22] <Cork> Eviltwin: it would reduce the size of most css files :)
[21:59:25] <Anphonic> see it*
[21:59:33] <Eviltwin> Right, I'm talking about jQuery / Sizzle
[21:59:33] <Cork> and yes its a preformance boost
[22:00:04] <Cork> not sure how much sizzle uses the built in css parsing engin
[22:00:17] <Cork> don't think it does that at all actually
[22:00:28] <Eviltwin> Which parsing engine?
[22:00:36] <systemfault> It would be stupid for sizzle to not use it..
[22:00:54] <Cork> systemfault: i'm not sure its accessable from js
[22:00:59] <systemfault> (When the selector APIs are available)
[22:01:43] <Eviltwin> I wonder if it's been discussed
[22:01:44] <newuser> hello all, I am use a jquery code available at a blog, to slidedown my submenu when I click on a list item, its working fine
[22:01:49] <Eviltwin> And if so, what they decided
[22:02:08] <Eviltwin> Re: pseudo -> QSA
[22:02:09] <newuser> but On clicking the item to slide down, I also want the menu to open a certain link while performing the slide down action
[22:02:13] <newuser> which is not working
[22:02:32] <newuser> my problem is something similar to what was explained here, and I am also using the same code, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/slide-down-and-open-link
[22:02:46] <newuser> which is written at the bottom of the apge
[22:02:48] <newuser> page*
[22:03:42] <Cork> Eviltwin, systemfault: thought so, it uses xpath nothing else
[22:04:10] <systemfault> What? :/
[22:04:33] <Cork> it splits the selector string up into chunks through regex, uses shortcuts for id selectors
[22:04:40] <palanivel> hi hi
[22:04:45] <Cork> and the rest is just xpath xml selectors
[22:04:52] * Anphonic gets tired of dancing for joy (in his chair)
[22:05:05] <systemfault> Cork: Where is querySelectorAll in this?

[22:21:23] <deltree_> I couldn't possibly be more confused by how .animate() works.  I had .animate working, and it was working fine, except it was reshaping the div around it.  I then moved it to position absolute, and it was suddenly firing twice whenever I set of the event.  I tried to make a minimal test case in jsfiddle and I can't even get halfway done before it just doesn't work.  Note in my testcase, it...
[22:21:25] <deltree_> ...fires on load, but not after load http://jsfiddle.net/rBWwY/
[22:23:10] <Cork> deltree_: if your wrapping your Show function in a function
[22:23:16] <Cork> its not globaly accessable
[22:23:20] <Cork> its called scoping
[22:23:34] <deltree_> Cork how do I get show out of a function in jsfiddle?
[22:23:39] <Cork> and is one in a long list of reasons why you shouldn't use inline events
[22:23:59] <Cork> deltree_: change onDomReady to head
[22:25:13] <deltree_> when I do, it still doesn't work
[22:25:30] <destryalhmns> onDomReady to head?
[22:25:48] <deltree_> correct
[22:26:06] <deltree_> in fact, I can't even demonstrate it working (as it does  when I put the code onDomReady
[22:26:21] <deltree_> it only works of course, when it loads, but it still works
[22:26:27] <destryalhmns> lol #1 google result http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/event/event-timing.html
[22:26:58] <systemfault> That's YUI, not jquery...
[22:27:14] <systemfault> And YUI 2.x... which sucks hard.
[22:27:16] <ngharo> YaHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooo
[22:27:20] <ngharo> sorry
[22:27:24] <systemfault> YUI3 is very good though.
[22:28:05] <deltree_> I don't understand .animate() and what I click in jslint isn't fixing that
[22:28:08] <systemfault> In jquery, domready is: $(function() {code here is called when dom is ready});
[22:28:13] <Cork> deltree_: well onlick can be the second problem :)
[22:28:40] <deltree_> thanks, my typo stopped me from putting together the test case
[22:28:50] <deltree_> I'll finish the test and get it for you, thanks
[22:29:00] <Cork> deltree_: but seriusly, you shouldn't use inline events
[22:29:01] <destryalhmns> same as onload?
[22:29:24] <deltree_> Cork: it's a better option when the elements are added at runtime
[22:29:29] <Cork> deltree_: its error phrone and causes all sorts of hell
[22:29:38] <systemfault> HTML is to describe the content.. not for behaviors and styling..
[22:29:47] <systemfault> It's simple.. really.
[22:29:49] <Cork> deltree_: except you can't ever handle the evnts afterwords
[22:29:54] <Cork> *events
[22:29:59] <deltree_> do you have a way to set the behavior as I create the element?
[22:30:27] <Cork> deltree_: live event listner, a class and a data-id attribute
[22:30:44] <deltree_> data-id?
[22:30:51] <Cork> and a second thing, don't use a tags for javascript click events
[22:30:54] <systemfault> destryalhmns: ?
[22:31:04] <Cork> deltree_: one min let me fix this up
[22:31:14] <destryalhmns> i learned jquery about two weeks after i learned js
[22:31:20] <destryalhmns> so my js is 90%jquery
[22:31:24] <destryalhmns> and i dont know this stuff
[22:31:27] <deltree_> I'm more js than jquery
[22:31:43] <deltree_> and I don't get along well with uis
[22:31:50] <deltree_> I'm more of a back-end coder
[22:32:48] <fourlegs> Hey guys, i know its probably not the right channel but i its a very active one and my request is somehow connected
[22:32:54] <systemfault> destryalhmns: domready isn't a real event in a lot of older browsers, basically, it's usually "marks" the moment at which the main dom tree is "ready" so you can use javascript to "play" on it
[22:33:07] <systemfault> destryalhmns: It's called before .load
[22:33:29] <destryalhmns> its just time dude, i made a complete system doing asp.net but am now doing clientside....you can be good at both
[22:33:52] <systemfault> destryalhmns: I agree, I'm good at both frontend and backend...
[22:33:56] <fourlegs> does anyone have suggestions to the design of my new project:
[22:33:57] <deltree_> asp.net != back-end code
[22:34:07] <systemfault> Anyway.. a programmer should be able to write in any language.
[22:34:10] <destryalhmns> systemfault, how do you tap it?
[22:34:20] <Cork> deltree_: http://jsfiddle.net/rBWwY/3/
[22:34:23] <deltree_> systemfault: being able to write in a language doesn't make you good at it
[22:34:36] <mindis|wurk> i sure wouldn't expect anyone to write ASM in this day and age
[22:34:40] <fourlegs> www.4legs.de/mti and second version www.4legs.de/mti2
[22:34:47] <Cork> deltree_: opps forgot the cursor css http://jsfiddle.net/rBWwY/4/
[22:34:57] <systemfault> mindis|wurk: I had fun writing asm 10-15 years ago :D
[22:35:05] <ngharo> yeah i've been scripting since i was 14 but compiled languages still throw me for a loop
[22:35:15] <mindis|wurk> systemfault yeah, back then it was almost mandatory
[22:36:27] <deltree_> scripting is what I did when I was 14
[22:37:10] <systemfault> Meh.
[22:37:33] <systemfault> Nobody can differentiate a programming language from a scripting language nowadays.
[22:37:57] <ngharo> i mostly run into problems when i have to maths
[22:38:02] <ngharo> i can't maths
[22:38:06] <mindis|wurk> it doesn't help that the line between the two has blurred
[22:38:16] <systemfault> mindis|wurk: I agree
[22:38:28] <systemfault> Even javascript.... is it REALLY a script?
[22:38:43] <mindis|wurk> i'd say definitely :P
[22:38:49] <systemfault> Why?
[22:39:01] <systemfault> It has standalone implementations... it's JIT'ed...
[22:39:02] <destryalhmns> if you think of how content is delivered, isnt it mostly over the web?
[22:39:16] <ngharo> no memory management
[22:39:22] <systemfault> shrug..
[22:39:35] <systemfault> So Java isn't a programming language by that definition?
[22:40:00] <destryalhmns> there are properties you need to memorize
[22:40:10] <Anphonic> ngharo: Thanks again, that thought had crossed my mind before but you brought it back at the right time to use it
[22:40:15] <deltree_> Java isn't a scripting language
[22:40:20] <systemfault> I agree.
[22:40:30] <deltree_> Java is compiled (more or less)
[22:40:35] <Anphonic> Java is a programming lang.
[22:40:43] <systemfault> Javascript, despite the name... I wouldn't say that it's a scripting language.
[22:41:04] <deltree_> I don't use it, but it's a respecttable enough language.  javascript is only starting to be considered a "language" because of node.js
[22:41:10] <destryalhmns> also, it can be multithreaded if an event fires out of context
[22:41:20] <systemfault> rhino has been existing for a while..
[22:41:23] <destryalhmns> like you need to use a closure to keep a reference
[22:41:27] <mindis|wurk> you could say that anything that doesn't compile like c isn't a programming language but then that would make almost everything a scripting language :)
[22:41:38] <Anphonic> I know, lets just all go back to Cobol and make it a modern language
[22:41:48] <deltree_> higher level languages are a good thing
[22:41:53] <deltree_> no one ever said they weren't
[22:41:55] <systemfault> mindis|wurk: Like you said.. the line is blurry nowadays between the two
[22:42:13] <mindis|wurk> i wouldn't even program anything without high level languages
[22:42:21] <mindis|wurk> c? fuck that shit :P
[22:42:22] <deltree_> I write ruby stuff for little programs all the time
[22:42:29] <Anphonic> It's a requirement here at the university, mainly due to large local companies
[22:42:45] <deltree_> I use php on my site, and I code in c# at work
[22:43:04] <systemfault> I use Java at work..
[22:43:09] <deltree_> I'm sorry
[22:43:10] <mindis|wurk> i write js/php at work and python at home
[22:43:15] <Anphonic> me too
[22:43:25] <systemfault> I prefer Java to PHP though..
[22:43:27] <deltree_> Java programmers usually have to work so hard because they're stuck in linux
[22:43:46] <Anphonic> well, Wife is giving me dirty looks so I guess its time for bed, being almost 1am and all
[22:43:48] <ngharo> stuck?
[22:43:52] <Cork> ya..
[22:43:52] <deltree_> I do enjoy being at a microsoft shop because of the beautiful guis
[22:43:56] <systemfault> deltree_: While I prefer C# over java... I never been stuck
[22:44:03] <Cork> i would say stuck in windows, but not in linux
[22:44:08] <ngharo> no you di'nt
[22:44:20] <deltree_> Cork: I didn't mean the programmer was stuck by the language, but by the shop
[22:44:47] <deltree_> most java jobs think they're such nice people for offering me a macbook if I get hired on
[22:44:48] <ngharo> linux is like the developers toolkit imo
[22:44:51] <deltree_> I don't want a macbook
[22:44:59] <systemfault> Why not?
[22:45:02] <destryalhmns> mobile?
[22:45:15] <deltree_> I like my windows
[22:45:27] <deltree_> and I love my intellisense
[22:45:29] <destryalhmns> but its kinda big cause thats how they want their content
[22:45:29] <ngharo> deltree, who woulda thunk
[22:45:43] <systemfault> Windows doesn't have a decent command line, that's my only problem with it...powershell isn't for me.
[22:45:56] <systemfault> And.. seriously... fuck cygwin.
[22:46:00] <deltree_> anyone who still has to google properties is not in a shop I want to work at
[22:46:20] <deltree_> systemfault: I have a tendency to build my own
[22:46:23] <systemfault> deltree_: Any decent IDE gives intellisense..
[22:46:42] <systemfault> I use IntelliJ IDEA at work... wonderful.
[22:46:46] <deltree_> systemfault: you of all people should know that plenty of shops out there don't use decent IDEs
[22:46:57] <deltree_> but they'll give you a geekdesk
[22:46:57] <systemfault> Better than Visual C#... without resharper.
[22:47:17] <ngharo> i'm the lone dev with full screen vim on screen while the other devs are all in eclipse
[22:47:28] <systemfault> Meh.. eclipse... POS
[22:47:35] <deltree_> vim....really?
[22:47:46] <ngharo> systemfault: yeah too clunky for me
[22:47:49] <systemfault> Eclipse is getting more and more unstable every release
[22:48:03] <destryalhmns> favorite browsers? i hate ff with a sincere passion
[22:48:21] <destryalhmns> see my post..
[22:48:25] <deltree_> still use chrome, but I develop in IE 'cause that's what my clients use
[22:48:27] <systemfault> destryalhmns: I began to "relike" it at version 9
[22:48:37] <systemfault> destryalhmns: But I prefer chrome.
[22:48:48] <ngharo> deltree_: i can understand your confusion being a windows c# guy
[22:49:13] <deltree_> ngharo: don't assume I haven't coded in oracle, or DSL before
[22:49:17] <destryalhmns> http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2418155
[22:49:18] <systemfault> ngharo: I love vim.. but I think that programming java in it is pure masochism.
[22:49:33] <deltree_> I just don't like having to open up a command prompt every time I want to do ANYTHING worthwhile on my computer
[22:49:42] <destryalhmns> to be fair, i was in in the wrong spot (that time) when i couldnt clear my cache but whatever, they suck
[22:49:45] <systemfault> ngharo: The java libs are so big... and there's so much of them....
[22:49:51] <deltree_> I can build command line programs, but if I want to, I can also put a nice little button to do all the work
[22:50:04] <destryalhmns> IE9 has not given me many problems
[22:50:08] <ngharo> systemfault: yeah definately can see that
[22:50:10] <systemfault> IE9 is a charm.
[22:50:10] <destryalhmns> ive had problems with ff and opera
[22:50:20] <deltree_> ngharo: how many times in a day do you have to give yourself execute permissions on a file
[22:50:31] <mindis|wurk> argh. damn it's hard to make a good autosizing iframe
[22:50:32] <systemfault> deltree_: Never?
[22:50:47] <ngharo> deltree_: man you are so far off
[22:51:03] <deltree_> yeah, 'cause gksudo changed the world right?
[22:51:17] <ngharo> no, because i'm not an idiot linux user
[22:51:22] <ngharo> lol
[22:51:23] <systemfault> deltree_: No... because you only need admin privileges to do... admin stuff.
[22:51:35] <systemfault> deltree_: Compiling a programming is hardly administrative.
[22:51:40] <deltree_> ok, simpler question, how many times per day do you have to enter your password
[22:51:43] <systemfault> *program
[22:51:53] <destryalhmns> a password, probably 100 times
[22:51:56] <systemfault> deltree_: Once per two days..
[22:51:58] <ngharo> deltree_: rarely ever
[22:52:02] <systemfault> To update my system...
[22:52:29] <ngharo> yeah, unless im installing applications which i dont do often
[22:52:53] <systemfault> Linux has problems... it's damn far from being perfect.
[22:52:57] <deltree_> ah, good linux users, you've customized your systems.  How many weeks would it take you to get linux to be halfway efficient if you had to start over tomorrow?
[22:53:14] <systemfault> deltree_: a day..
[22:53:31] <ngharo> deltree_: i have my dotfiles backed up
[22:53:39] <deltree_> well, I'll let your egos slide, go ls your way into job security
[22:53:48] <ngharo> apt-get install xorg dwm vim cscope
[22:53:50] <systemfault> Meh...
[22:53:52] <ngharo> restore dotfiles
[22:53:54] <ngharo> and im set :)
[22:54:23] <joshsmith> how can I get the index of an item I just appended?
[22:54:26] <systemfault> I wish more people would be like me for OSes...
[22:54:34] <joshsmith> I want to append it, hide it, and then fade it in
[22:54:49] <joshsmith> or could I just get the parent's last-child and do it that way?
[22:55:49] <destryalhmns> josh, can you set its css to visibility:hidden?
[22:55:59] <destryalhmns> or display:none
[22:56:22] <joshsmith> destryalhmns: I could. I think I have a .hidden class
[22:56:31] <ngharo> systemfault: yeah OS discussions always go to the DEATH
[22:56:36] <destryalhmns> okay so something like..
[22:56:54] <destryalhmns> set it to hidden on none
[22:56:59] <destryalhmns> .append
[22:57:10] <destryalhmns> css it to not mess up other elements on append
[22:57:15] <destryalhmns> or do that before
[22:57:21] <destryalhmns> maybe use position absolute
[22:57:26] <destryalhmns> do your animate
[22:57:34] <destryalhmns> and then put it back to normal
[22:58:15] <destryalhmns> *hidden OR
[22:59:35] <destryalhmns> .height() and .width will also help
[22:59:40] <destryalhmns> .width()
[23:29:52] <poppiez> can anyone confirm that the animate complete callback fires too early on ipad and iphone?
[23:30:12] <Eviltwin> Doesn't sound right
[23:30:38] <roman__> hello guys
[23:31:06] <roman__> anybody?
[23:31:12] <patrick99e99> hello roman__
[23:31:28] <roman__> where are you from?
[23:31:47] <patrick99e99> roman__: the internet
[23:31:57] <roman__> ah, it's close
[23:32:01] <patrick99e99> it sure is.
[23:32:24] <roman__> a lot of people here?
[23:32:43] <patrick99e99> $('.people_in_jquery').length  ==>  "a lot!"
[23:32:45] <destryalhmns> trying invoking c# vs java
[23:32:53] <Cork> roman__: currently 863 users
[23:33:04] <roman__> online?
[23:33:14] <Cork> well connected
[23:33:37] <Hereisanotherlie> where is a good place for jquery tutorials?
[23:33:45] <destryalhmns> css3
[23:33:52] <roman__> what do you discuss?
[23:33:53] <destryalhmns> w3c sry
[23:34:07] <mindis|wurk> we discuss the size of our socks
[23:34:31] <Hereisanotherlie> destryalhmns: thanks, I should have thought of that
[23:35:46] <patrick99e99> if I have <body class="foo"> ... <a>something</a> ...  Is it any more efficient to do $('body.foo a') vs. $('.foo a') ?
[23:35:55] <destryalhmns> agreed, because while java is cross platform the world only uses one platform
[23:36:30] <fourlegs> Hereisanotherlie: net.tutsplus.com has some good tuts
[23:37:10] <Qbix1> hey guys
[23:37:16] <Qbix1> has anyone used easyxdm?
[23:37:44] <Hereisanotherlie> fourlegs: oh cool, I didn't know they had a coding area. I used them to learn photoshop way back when
[23:38:28] <roman__> anyone speaks german?
[23:38:33] <fourlegs> but those tuts are to big sometimes
[23:38:37] <fourlegs> roman__: yes
[23:38:52] <roman__> hallo )
[23:38:57] <Qbix1> privet :)
[23:39:07] <roman__> privet )
[23:39:25] <Cork> patrick99e99: the first one will select all elements body where the class is foo, so yes that should be a tiny bit faster
[23:39:32] <Cork> patrick99e99: but it shouldn't matter
[23:39:57] <fourlegs> roman__: so?
[23:40:10] <roman__> i'm starting learning German
[23:40:11] <Cork> patrick99e99: the selection order is: find all a tags, check in there parent structure if they have a parent of nodeName 'body' with class .foo
[23:40:31] <fourlegs> c'mon ... in a irc-chan?
[23:40:33] <Cork> patrick99e99: so its not a big difference
[23:40:44] <roman__> yes )
[23:40:46] <Cork> (miniscure even)
[23:41:05] <DreamStiffler> guys...i used .text()
[23:41:06] <mindis|wurk> oh it's that way around? i thought it went body->.foos->a's
[23:41:23] <DreamStiffler> how do i add a space before the text? btw im not a programmer or any sort
[23:41:23] <Cork> mindis|wurk: css selectors work from right to left
[23:41:35] <Eviltwin> Well modern selector engines do
[23:41:39] <destryalhmns> &nbsp;
[23:41:40] <roman__> fourlegs: where are you from?
[23:41:40] <Cork> mindis|wurk: with exceptions of id's where it uses shortcuts
[23:41:41] <Eviltwin> The older ones were left to right
[23:41:48] <fourlegs> germany ^^
[23:42:12] <destryalhmns> or
[23:42:21] <roman__> which Stadt?
[23:42:28] <destryalhmns> remember ir by this handy ...nm
[23:42:32] <DreamStiffler> lets say im retrieving text from 4 td's. a b c and d. the return would be abcd. i want to have spacing between these. how d i do this?
[23:42:56] <mindis|wurk> Cork damn. so is it faster to say '#derp a' instead of just 'a' if all anchors are within '#derp'? that's how i thought it worked
[23:43:02] <Eviltwin> DreamStiffler: If you do .text() it does a straight concatenation of the strings of the subtree
[23:43:08] <Eviltwin> In document order
[23:43:24] <Cork> mindis|wurk: it is
[23:43:33] <Eviltwin> There's nothing you can do to change that
[23:43:35] <mindis|wurk> despite the reverse order? strange
[23:43:45] <DreamStiffler> Eviltwin: ok any sugestion?
[23:43:49] <Cork> mindis|wurk: and if you say its within another element its the sam thing
[23:43:57] <Cork> mindis|wurk: like $(this).find(...)
[23:44:08] <Eviltwin> DreamStiffler: Select the elements you're interested in and use .map -> .get -> .join
[23:44:10] <mindis|wurk> that's what i tend to use
[23:44:56] <DreamStiffler> Eviltwin: i need all 4 elements. so i still have to use these ?
[23:45:07] <Cork> mindis|wurk: sizzle looks in the css selector for id's and uses the much quicker getElementById if it finds it
[23:45:25] <Cork> mindis|wurk: that means it can reduce the number of elements it needs to look through A LOT
[23:45:30] <Cork> for almost no cost
[23:45:46] <Eviltwin> DreamStiffler: see ?.map see ?.get see ?g javascript array join
[23:45:47] <bot-t> DreamStiffler, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[23:45:48] <bot-t> DreamStiffler, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[23:45:50] <bot-t> DreamStiffler, JavaScript join() Method - http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp
[23:46:55] <mindis|wurk> Cork i thought i read somewhere classes are just about as fast these days
[23:47:16] <DreamStiffler> thanks Eviltwin
[23:47:17] <Cork> classes are really fast
[23:47:24] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: Classes are fast compared to, say, looking up by a partial match on an attribute
[23:47:25] <Cork> cause  you have getElementsByClassName
[23:47:30] <Cork> but its not as fast as id's
[23:47:43] <Eviltwin> But I would suspect IDs are still marginally faster
[23:47:56] <destryalhmns> if you remove a class and then add a class will you ever see the element jump?
[23:48:10] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: The redraw doesn't happen until JavaScript yields
[23:48:23] <destryalhmns> evil idk what that means
[23:48:31] <Eviltwin> So JavaScript is single-threaded
[23:48:34] <Cork> it means the javascript block ends
[23:48:35] <Cork> :)
[23:48:40] <destryalhmns> ohhh
[23:48:42] <QbY> So many search results, so little time…  Can someone point me to a defacto example of using jquery to erase the (default) value="foo" in an input on a form?
[23:48:51] <destryalhmns> thats good knowledge, thx man
[23:48:52] <Eviltwin> Once everything has returned, the redraw happens
[23:49:03] <Eviltwin> If you use setTimeout/setInterval
[23:49:10] <Eviltwin> And JavaScript returns
[23:49:18] <Eviltwin> It lets draws happen but will take over control again after that amout of time
[23:49:23] <Cork> ?.removeAttr @ Qbix1
[23:49:23] <Cork> opps
[23:49:23] <Cork> QbY: ^
[23:49:24] <Eviltwin> Same thing with events
[23:49:25] <bot-t> Qbix1, .removeAttr(attributeName): Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[23:49:36] <QbY> Cork: Thank you.
[23:49:38] <Eviltwin> Once you bind them, you hand control over to the rest of the browser
[23:49:40] <Cork> :)
[23:49:43] <Eviltwin> But when the event happens, JavaScript will take control again
[23:49:46] <Eviltwin> For your event listener
[23:49:48] <Cork> Qbix1: sorry about that
[23:50:21] <Cork> Eviltwin: you've heard about the new proposal for threaded js? (not workers)
[23:50:39] <Eviltwin> I've yet to see a good usecase for threads in JS in the browser
[23:50:45] <Eviltwin> Aside from the idea of Workers
[23:51:20] <Cork> this basically is a light wight worker solution
[23:51:34] <Cork> where multible workers can have access to the same (read only) memory
[23:51:35] <Eviltwin> I could understand maybe threads in user space
[23:51:45] <Eviltwin> Where a function can choose to yield and let another one do some work
[23:52:10] <Eviltwin> And when the other one yields, you end up back where you were
[23:52:45] <mindis|wurk> is it possible to load a page into a div with the same sandbox effect as iframe so that the styles won't intermingle between the parent page and the frame content?
[23:52:47] <Eviltwin> A yield also causing a redraw
[23:52:53] <patrick99e99> if I have <body class="foo"> ... <a>something</a> ...  Is it any more efficient to do $('body.foo a') vs. $('.foo a') ?
[23:53:15] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: Does .load inject styles?
[23:53:23] <Eviltwin> IIRC it doesn't inject script
[23:53:26] <Eviltwin> But I could be wrong about that
[23:53:30] <Eviltwin> I never use it directly
[23:53:52] <mindis|wurk> i only ask because iframes are such a bitch when it comes to autosizing and positioning them
[23:54:04] <Cork> Eviltwin: http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/01/09/parallel-javascript/
[23:54:10] <palanivel> hi .......how to control slide show using onclick function in jquery
[23:54:12] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: Have you tried using .load?
[23:54:41] <QbY> Hey Cork..  On this .removeAttr(), if I'm reading this correctly I'm going to have to attach to a button.  What I want is to place a value in value="" for an input, when a user clicks into the field, it disappears, when they exit without changing, it returns.
[23:54:45] <mindis|wurk> Eviltwin yeah, i've used it in the past but the parent styles are applied to the child
[23:54:50] <Eviltwin> Cork: "User Model" is pretty much exactly what I described
[23:54:55] <Eviltwin> Except the children actually have to terminate
[23:55:07] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: Oh, you mean that direction
[23:55:18] <mindis|wurk> well, both ways really
[23:55:24] <mindis|wurk> hence, sandbox
[23:55:26] <Cork> Eviltwin: yup, just thought i should link you to it :)
[23:55:35] <Cork> QbY: ah, then you want focus and blur on the element
[23:55:47] <mindis|wurk> and i'm not too sure if it's very proper to have a new <html> starting inside a <div>
[23:55:59] <Cork> QbY: and you could just use .val('') / .val('placeholder')
[23:56:02] <Eviltwin> Cork: Honestly I'd much rather see generators
[23:56:08] <Cork> (on $(this) )
[23:56:12] <Eviltwin> Which is part of 1.7
[23:56:23] <Eviltwin> But I'd like to see generators working in every browser
[23:56:30] <QbY> Cork:  OK.
[23:56:36] <Cork> Eviltwin: can't say i'm exited about generators
[23:56:56] <Cork> Eviltwin: that most lilly won't happen in many many many years
[23:57:02] <Eviltwin> They're more valuable in languages that don't have callbacks with scope
[23:57:16] <Cork> Eviltwin: looks like no other browser plan to go past ecma 5
[23:57:16] <Eviltwin> But still wouldn't hurt to have in JavaScript
