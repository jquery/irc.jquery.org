[00:01:03] <grafi> morning peoplez
[00:01:12] <Cork> Kamuela: var script = document.createElement('script'); script.onload = function() { /* your jquery code goes here */ */ }; script.src = '//code.jquery.com/jquery.js'; document.head.appendNode(script);
[00:01:33] <Cork> morning grafi
[00:01:52] <Cork> second last work day for the year *woho*
[00:02:08] <ravenzz> morning
[00:02:25] <Kamuela> Cork: so you mean basically that we don't know if jquery was loaded before we start doing other things?
[00:02:43] <Cork> Kamuela: actually you know jquery isn't loaded :)
[00:03:09] <Cork> cause the script can't be evaluated until your stack ends
[00:03:13] <grafi> Cork :D
[00:03:40] <Kamuela> Cork: wait, so if the first code is the appendchild for the jquery script include, this won't load?
[00:03:58] <Cork> Kamuela: it will trigger to load the script
[00:04:10] <Cork> and the script will queue for execution
[00:04:18] <Kamuela> i see what you're saying
[00:04:20] <Cork> or rather append will trigger to load the script
[00:04:21] <Kamuela> sort of
[00:04:41] <Kamuela> meaning it will try to execute the rest of the current script before the dom will try to execute the new child script include?
[00:04:47] <Cork> the browser will parse the script and wait for execution rights
[00:04:54] <Cork> your current script ends
[00:05:02] <Cork> and the browser handles the new script
[00:05:14] <Cork> Kamuela: not try, it is forced to
[00:05:40] <Cork> there is only three things that can interrupt javascript
[00:05:53] <Cork> 1. alert/confirm
[00:06:01] <Cork> 2. plugins
[00:06:23] <Cork> 3. syncron calls (sync ajax, localstorage and the like)
[00:06:54] <Cork> in all other cases the js stack has to end before the browser can continue doing things
[00:07:09] <Kamuela> Cork: i'm a bit confused. so my script is called. and my script adds a jquery script tag to the dom. is the jquery script executed when that happens? or will it wait for the current script to finish, and THEN execute the jquery script i added?
[00:07:21] <Cork> and this is why you get the page feeze if js loops for too long and so on
[00:07:47] <Cork> Kamuela: the append happens, and the network stack fetches the script
[00:08:02] <Cork> but no it doesn't add the content to the page until your stack ends
[00:08:15] <Kamuela> i see, so jquery functionality doesn't get implemented
[00:08:22] <Cork> the browser can't modify the dom while js executes
[00:08:22] <Kamuela> so if my script requires jquery, no go
[00:08:28] <Cork> that would risk causing crashes
[00:08:37] <Cork> Kamuela: the script i gave you would work
[00:08:56] <Cork> cause it uses callbacks for when the script is added
[00:09:12] <Cork> so the flows becomes
[00:09:44] <Cork> your code executes > adds a script tag > loads script > executes the new script > your callback is called and you can use the new script
[00:10:12] <Cork> but everything that needs the new code needs to be in the callback
[00:10:47] <Kamuela> Cork: so if basically everything requires jquery, i'd have to include my entire script as it exists now within that callback?
[00:11:07] <Cork> Kamuela: or if functions you call from the callback yes
[00:11:26] <Kamuela> ohhh, yeah i think that would make sense
[00:11:46] <Kamuela> but wait, you just said that you can't add dom elements right?
[00:11:51] <Kamuela> until a script finishes
[00:11:57] <Kamuela> or can jquery do that
[00:12:25] <Cork> dom elements can be added
[00:12:32] <Kamuela> Cork: basically I'm linking a stylesheet and creating a div structure to house a widget that requires jquery
[00:12:40] <Cork> but the browser can't on it's own modify the content
[00:12:54] <Kamuela> Cork: i'm trying to have the widget installable anywhere in a page just by saying <script src="mywidget.js"></script>
[00:13:05] <Cork> that won't work
[00:13:19] <Cork> cause it would require identifying the location of the script tag
[00:13:38] <Kamuela> right which is why at some point up there before you came i asked if there was like a $(this) identifier of some sort
[00:13:40] <Cork> i would recommend adding a wrapper around the script tag
[00:14:01] <Cork> <div id="my-widget"><script src="mywidget.js"></script></div>
[00:14:19] <Cork> or <div id="my-widget"></div><script src="mywidget.js"></script>
[00:14:41] <Cork> Kamuela: also i would recommend allowing the user to call it them self instead of automagically doing it
[00:14:47] <Kamuela> Cork: by the same token, should i just include the stylesheet link outside of the script as well?
[00:14:53] <Cork> integrating it with the system would be much easier if you do
[00:15:01] <Cork> Kamuela: yes
[00:15:22] <Cork> and that would mean the style is scoped to the wrapper in modern browsers
[00:15:23] <Kamuela> Cork: by the same token, call jquery outside of the script too? hahahahaha
[00:15:33] <Cork> depends
[00:15:42] <Cork> but yes totally possible
[00:16:04] <Cork> Kamuela: basically i'm very much against widget magic
[00:16:25] <Cork> cause it assumes everyone wants to use the widget in one way and one way only
[00:16:36] <Kamuela> <link><div></div><script jquery></script><script widget></script> look good then?
[00:16:53] <Cork> and it results in really nasty code if they need somethign else
[00:17:13] <Cork> Kamuela: yes that would work
[00:17:22] <Cork> though i'm not sure link in body is valid
[00:17:57] <Cork> i know it wasn't, but they changed quite a bit of that in later standards
[00:18:15] <Kamuela> i really hope it is, because put this in your head and this in your body i think isn't what i'm looking for in terms of installability
[00:18:36] <Kamuela> originally i was going to go with iframe but i scrapped that
[00:19:20] <Cork> Kamuela: actually "put this in you head call this on the element where you want to load it"
[00:19:32] <Cork> is how i would create it
[00:19:53] <GoSox> Can anyone direct me to some simple sample code for jquery form submission with some basic input validation
[00:19:55] <Cork> <script>$('target').myWidget();</script>
[00:20:20] <Cork> GoSox: you would need a plugin for validation
[00:20:26] <Kamuela> I think most people are used to dumping code into one part of the HTML
[00:20:26] <Cork> unless you want to use html form validation
[00:20:31] <Cork> or write it your self
[00:20:38] <Kamuela> rather than understanding the DOM/structure of it 100%
[00:20:46] <Cork> Kamuela: and the web is quite broken cause of it ya
[00:21:00] <Cork> Kamuela: an id and a <div id=""></div>
[00:21:03] <Cork> isn't dom structure
[00:21:18] <Cork> it's just a very simple selector
[00:21:26] <GoSox> yes i can write the validation part, i just need a placeholder for the validation in the form submission part
[00:21:47] <Cork> GoSox: well form submision is the submit event on the form
[00:22:02] <Cork> and for the actual sending you can use ajax or just plain post
[00:22:04] <Kamuela> Cork: i understand where you're coming from in terms of clean code, but you can't sell soda that people mix themselves in 2 plastic bags because it is "cleaner" than an aluminum can they may not want
[00:22:20] <Cork> Kamuela: yes you can
[00:22:23] <Kamuela> haha
[00:22:28] <Cork> my point is the code doesn't have to be harder
[00:22:38] <Cork> just not stupefied
[00:22:52] <Cork> it doesn't even have to be more code
[00:23:05] <Cork> as long as you construct the load handling correctly
[00:23:17] <Cork> for example check google analytics
[00:23:21] <Cork> it uses this structure
[00:24:26] <fabioportieri> good morning
[00:28:16] <Kamuela> Cork: are you against iframes for much the same reason?
[00:28:28] <Cork> no
[00:28:42] <Cork> well i would never load iframes if i don't absolute have to
[00:28:51] <Kamuela> Cork: do you think widgets within iframes have a place?
[00:29:17] <Cork> only if the widget is loaded from a third party
[00:29:28] <GoSox> how can i reference multiple its in the same selector? something ilke $("#id1","#id2").hide();
[00:29:28] <Cork> so... eh kinda but preferably not
[00:29:33] <GoSox> IDs*
[00:29:34] <Kamuela> ok so in my case, yes
[00:29:42] <Kamuela> interesting, i went full circle
[00:29:54] <Cork> GoSox: combine the strings into on with the comma still there
[00:29:59] <Cork> "id, id"
[00:30:04] <Cork> GoSox: think css selectors
[00:30:28] <GoSox> so $("#name,#email").
[00:30:45] <Cork> Kamuela: so basically if the widget is to communicate with you and not them, and not with the rest of the page
[00:30:54] <Cork> then yes it should definitely be in an iframe
[00:31:15] <Cork> cause then it gets shielded off from each other
[00:32:17] <Kamuela> Cork: yeah, ok, it's a currency exchange ratio widget with 3rd party stuff, iframe'd
[00:32:56] <geiregjo> Anyone got an idea when jqm 1.4.0 is going to be release? :D
[00:33:07] <geiregjo> It's been stable for weeks now and their milestone is reached.
[00:46:43] <zhulikas> hey fellas
[00:47:14] <zhulikas> using JQueryMobile... have a persistent panel on the left side. Now my responsiveness is all fucked up
[00:47:19] <zhulikas> anyone ever dealt with that?
[00:47:29] <zhulikas> when resizing browser, widths are broken
[00:47:35] <zhulikas> because panel is not taken into calculations in css
[01:14:47] <felixjet> if i can select some trigger with $('#settings .form-control a').
[01:15:03] <felixjet> should i do that, or better assign that <a id="foo"> and make it $('#foo') ?
[01:15:42] <HelperW> Depends...
[01:15:45] <Cork> felixjet: you can, and what you shold do depends on how many elements there is and what you are going to do with them
[01:16:05] <felixjet> there is only 1 possible element like that
[01:16:10] <felixjet> its a "form reset"
[01:16:38] <Cork> felixjet: then it should most likely be a <button type="reset"></button> instead
[01:17:12] <felixjet> but the form doesnt submit
[01:17:23] <felixjet> only make some jquery things
[01:17:30] <Cork> neither does reset
[01:17:41] <Cork> and you should always go around the submit event for a form
[01:17:46] <felixjet> i mean, clicking on a default html reset button wont do anything
[01:17:50] <Cork> else your breaking things
[01:17:58] <felixjet> it wont return the things to its initial position
[01:18:11] <felixjet> i need to do that with javascript by myself
[01:18:17] <Cork> felixjet: so listen for the reset event on the form
[01:18:19] <felixjet> thats why i need a click event on that link/button
[01:18:22] <Cork> and move things to where they should be
[01:18:24] <felixjet> should it still be reset?
[01:18:27] <Cork> yes
[01:18:35] <Cork> a reset button and a reset event on the form
[01:18:39] <felixjet> $('input[type=reset]') ?
[01:18:45] <Cork> no
[01:18:57] <Cork> $('form').on('reset', function() {})
[01:19:10] <felixjet> kk, thank you!
[01:31:33] <felixjet> its a must to put action="" and method="" on <form> that only works as a jquery trigger and doesnt submit ?
[01:31:36] <krambiorix> http://jsfiddle.net/gEd2c/  --> can someone understand why this is NaN ?!
[01:32:51] <Cork> felixjet: no it isn't; through i would argue you should have a plain falblack
[01:33:01] <Cork> *fallback
[01:33:43] <felixjet> ill try to make one then
[01:33:43] <krambiorix> Cork, any idea?
[01:34:14] <seutje> what's the best way to grab text, excluding other children? var children = $el.children().detach(), text = $el.text(); $el.append(children); ?
[01:35:10] <seutje> say to exclude the span's text in <a>foo<span>bar</span></a>
[01:36:00] <Cork> krambiorix: cause undefined * (80/100) == NaN
[01:36:18] <Cork> js> print(undefined * (80 / 100))
[01:36:23] <b-ot> Cork: NaN
[01:37:12] <Cork> seutje: $el.children().remove() should work
[01:37:26] <seutje> I don't wanna asplode any handlers though
[01:37:28] <Cork> seutje: possibly $el.children('*').remove()
[01:37:40] <Cork> asplode?
[01:37:54] <seutje> explode/remove
[01:38:27] <Cork> seutje: so var old = $el.children('*').detatch();
[01:39:59] <seutje> senks
[01:40:02] <seutje> btw http://www.asplode.net/ :P
[01:40:11] <Cork> :)
[01:40:55] <Cork> krambiorix: did you understand what was wrong?
[01:43:24] <krambiorix> Cork, yes, just tested it, it works, thanks (stupid me :D)
[02:16:58] <reuf> can anybody show me some example of great feedback box with great UI - modal, etc.?
[02:22:36] <reuf> any suggestison for nice ui feedback box - modal, etc?
[02:31:11] <drager> Anyone got a tip for namespacing in jquery?
[02:31:32] <grafi> namespacing what?
[02:32:22] <drager> grafi: namespace patterns for plugins
[02:33:23] <dekiss> animate() is using css transition and if browser is is9 it uses javascript?
[02:33:49] <pacmac> hello

[02:35:18] <pacmac> var $objetivo = ("body div ul li ol li:nth-child(4)");
[02:37:17] <dekiss> animate() is supported by ie8?
[02:38:47] <pacmac> I forgot the $
[02:39:36] <dekiss> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2527383/jquery-using-animate-fails-to-do-anything-in-ie8 :(
[02:40:51] <dekiss> !animate

[03:42:45] <Agemaniac> i am making an ajax call and getting a json back, i create an object from it and i want to add a listener to it... how do i do it? this doesnt seem to work...
[03:42:45] <dekiss> how can i do this like when I click some element $( "#aa" ).click(function() {
[03:42:45] <dekiss>   $("this").animate({...
[03:42:51] <dekiss> so I get the clicked element
[03:42:55] <Agemaniac> google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
[03:42:57] <Agemaniac>       ajaxLoadMarkerInfo(marker, data.meters[i].id );
[03:42:58] <Agemaniac> });
[03:43:00] <dekiss> how can  I use "this" in jquery?
[03:43:09] <Agemaniac> it said data.meters[i] is not defined :(
[03:43:32] <Cork> dekiss: $(this)
[03:44:27] <Cork> Agemaniac: make sure your server is sending json (content-type: application/json) and check that the structure you want to access is correct
[03:44:44] <dekiss> Cork thanks
[03:45:51] <Agemaniac> Cork:  the data is correct, i get what i want and then i loop trhough each item, but when i want to add the listener, the variable is not available there, and i would like to pass it somehow as a parameter, but i dont know how to do it :S
[03:46:06] <Cork> Agemaniac: code please
[03:46:16] <Cork> or rather code and json structure
[03:46:43] <Agemaniac> Cork: ill send it to you in a pm :)
[03:46:51] <Cork> eh.. no
[03:47:44] <Agemaniac> do you know the url of a website where i can share my code?
[03:47:48] <Agemaniac> i dont remember any atm :/
[03:47:55] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[03:48:33] <dekiss> how can I do something on click then use animate here $( "#popup_container" ).click(function() {
[03:48:34] <dekiss>   $(this).animate({
[03:48:52] <Cork> dekiss: exactly like that
[03:48:55] <dekiss> so I want when  iclick #popup_container first something to happen then to animate the element
[03:48:59] <dekiss> :S
[03:49:11] <dekiss> bit I want something to happen before the animation
[03:49:13] <Cork> dekiss: create a fiddle with the problem
[03:49:23] <dekiss> should I assign another click event to the same element
[03:49:23] <dekiss> ?
[03:50:22] <Cork> dekiss: create a fiddle with the problem
[03:50:34] <Agemaniac> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/K4PER/
[03:51:42] <Agemaniac> its just in this line: ajaxLoadMarkerInfo(marker, data.meters[i].id );    where i can not access the "data" variable
[03:51:46] <dekiss> Cork please see if you can http://jsfiddle.net/HuUZz/
[03:52:07] <dekiss> I want to change background iamge of #popup_container before the animation happen
[03:53:07] <Cork> Agemaniac: try var meters = data.meters; before the for loop
[03:53:24] <Cork> Agemaniac: and then use meters in the rest of the loop and the event handler
[03:53:36] <Cork> Agemaniac: i suspect you get problem cause gc grabs data
[03:53:42] <Agemaniac> ok! ill give it a try :)
[03:55:24] <Cork> dekiss: http://jsfiddle.net/HuUZz/1/
[03:55:52] <Cork> dekiss: just replace the background before the animation
[03:56:17] <Agemaniac> thanks Cork! Indeed that was the problem :)
[03:56:26] <Cork> nice
[03:56:40] <Cork> Agemaniac: do you understand what happend?
[03:58:07] <Agemaniac> well, i understand part of it, i see that my data var was not available due to a reason (which i dont know). But by saving it in a variable then the "data" wouldnt get lost :)
[03:58:53] <Cork> Agemaniac: the reason is that gc (Garbage Collector) didn't find anything inside the success callback holding on to the object in data
[03:59:19] <Cork> Agemaniac: if you didn't need it for an event listener it would have worked fine
[03:59:42] <Agemaniac> i see
[03:59:44] <Cork> but as it was needed in the scope after the function ended, you needed to create a hook holding onto the data (the var meter variable)
[03:59:52] <dekiss> Cork thanks
[04:00:12] <Agemaniac> ok now i get it :)
[04:00:24] <Agemaniac> Cork: thanks a lot again! :D
[04:00:27] <Cork> np
[04:00:42] <Cork> this is a common pit fall with arguments
[04:00:55] <Cork> as they aren't actually created in the scope
[04:01:41] <dekiss> is it ok to make img element block with display: block?
[04:01:47] <Cork> yes
[04:01:56] <Cork> it's just style
[04:02:57] <dekiss> ok thanks
[04:03:00] <dekiss> yo usure man?
[04:03:04] <Cork> yes
[04:03:05] <dekiss> this is very important for me sorry
[04:08:09] <dekiss> Cork how can I animate two element on click?
[04:08:29] <Cork> just create a selector that matches both and run animate
[04:11:26] <dekiss> Cork thank you
[04:11:40] <dekiss> Cork I did one after another animate
[04:11:42] <dekiss> wait
[04:12:01] <dekiss> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/HuUZz/2/
[04:12:09] <dekiss> please see this see just javascirpt code ignore other
[04:12:12] <dekiss> is this ok?
[04:12:20] <Cork> ya
[04:12:43] <Cork> as they are meant to dof slightly different things it is how you would have to do it
[04:13:41] <dekiss> thank you! Cork
[04:13:55] <dekiss> so it is ok?
[04:13:59] <dekiss> kk
[04:14:03] <dekiss> just wanted to be sure sorry
[04:27:44] <dwarder> i have a handler on <li> but somewhere inside that like i have a link <a>, handle for <li> prevents opening the link, how do i workaround this?
[04:28:45] <ravigehlot> I am trying to hover over a picture and have it display text like it would in a lightbox. This is what I got working so far, the problem is that the opacity is making the text look very dim. http://codepen.io/ravigehlot/pen/CArft
[04:29:44] <Cork> dwarder: check if event.target is 'a' and don't act on if it if is
[04:29:58] <Cork> *on it if it is
[04:30:41] <luxigo> dwarder: maybe using something like $('li').on('click','a',...) ? use jsfiddle to be more explicit
[04:33:32] <dekiss> Cork how can I do this
[04:33:35] <dekiss> so I got this working
[04:33:46] <dekiss> so now I want when clicked the images to zoom in
[04:33:54] <dekiss> but when again clicked to zoom out
[04:33:56] <dekiss> how can I do this?
[04:34:01] <Hisoka> hi
[04:34:39] <Hisoka> how can i reload the DOM of a page using ajax ? because when i do my ajax modification the DOM seems to not be reloaded
[04:35:04] <Cork> Hisoka: you can't reload the dom
[04:35:12] <Cork> you can reload the page though if that is what you mean
[04:35:33] <Hisoka> hum i wont reload all the page
[04:35:54] <Cork> Hisoka: when you make modify the dom you trigger reflow and rerendering of the page
[04:36:01] <Hisoka> the idea is just to take in consideration the <div id='page'></div> modified by the ajax thing
[04:36:05] <Cork> so it should just work as long as you do the correct things
[04:36:17] <Hisoka> so the dom is already modified hum
[04:36:30] <Cork> Hisoka: well make sure you actually modify the dom
[04:36:40] <Cork> "ajax" doesn't do this on it's own
[04:36:57] <Hisoka> the div is correctly modified with this in the success: $("#page").html(code_html).fadeIn("slow");
[04:37:18] <Cork> well #page is already visible i guess?
[04:37:25] <Hisoka> yes of course :)
[04:37:29] <Cork> fadeIn woudn't do anything in that case
[04:37:51] <Cork> opacity:1 fade to opacity:1
[04:37:55] <dwarder> Cork: luxigo: thank you
[04:38:20] <Hisoka> yes i see that dosent did anythink but not the "real" problem now
[04:38:52] <Cork> Hisoka: try if $('[id="page"]').length != 1
[04:40:54] <Hisoka> hum currently the modification change, and it's visible but i use a "jcarousel" in one of my pages, this is what dosent work: a jcarousel loaded by ajax dont work
[04:41:25] <Cork> Hisoka: the slideshow might keep the original dom in a variable or something like that
[04:41:35] <Cork> and replaces things (so it overwrites your change)
[04:41:55] <Cork> how this is handled depends on the plugin though
[04:43:04] <Hisoka> so this is a problem in the jcarousel plugin ?
[04:43:16] <Cork> most likely
[04:43:24] <abishek> could someone advice what is wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/EqwkQ/96/
[04:43:44] <Cork> Hisoka: check what the plugin does to the dom, that might be a way around it
[04:43:58] <Cork> Hisoka: but most likely you need to tell it to handle new data somehow
[04:44:18] <Cork> abishek: you need to delegate your event listener
[04:44:35] <b0bbi10> using a string selector as the 2nd argument to specify a context, does it look something like this: $headerBoxes = $('.note', '.header'); ?
[04:44:37] <Cork> oh, wait sorry
[04:44:58] <abishek> Cork, isn't the 2nd parameter of on() doing that?
[04:44:58] <Cork> abishek: your delegating to a none static parent
[04:45:02] <Cork> yes
[04:45:10] <Cork> but myRow is dynamic
[04:45:21] <abishek> oh, so the parent should be static
[04:45:40] <Cork> abishek: http://jsfiddle.net/EqwkQ/97/
[04:46:00] <abishek> Cork, thnx. Appreciate your help
[04:46:05] <Cork> abishek: what the command means is: find $(selector) bind an event listener to it
[04:46:26] <Cork> abishek: as the event bubbles up from the children check if the selector matches the original target
[04:46:44] <Hisoka> this is the jcarousel plugin: http://pastebin.com/jtSKqtFx , but how to force it to reload ? it's in a unnamed function :s
[04:46:56] <Cork> abishek: so if the one where you bind the event on doesn't exist, no handler that does the work
[04:46:59] <abishek> ok
[04:47:12] <abishek> ok, understand it
[04:47:26] <abishek> Cork, thnx for the detailed explanation
[04:47:44] <Cork> Hisoka: that's not the reload i talked about
[04:47:57] <Cork> Hisoka: you might have commands in the plugin for updating content
[04:48:15] <Cork> Hisoka: http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/docs/reference/api.html#reload
[04:49:23] <Hisoka> hum i see, i read that
[04:50:59] <Hisoka> i have to use it in the success part in my ajax object ? like that : http://pastebin.com/kJ8Mqye7
[04:51:43] <Cork> just me guessing, but ya possibly
[04:51:57] <Cork> unless you actually replace the entire carousel
[04:52:12] <Cork> then you need to run the code you showed before
[04:52:24] <Hisoka> all the code ? :s
[04:52:38] <Hisoka> i'l try to name the function so
[04:52:49] <Cork> http://pastebin.com/jtSKqtFx
[04:52:58] <pacmac> $(document).ready( function() { 	$('p').html("test"); });
[04:53:03] <pacmac> what am I doing bad?
[04:53:17] <Cork> pacmac: your pasting code without context
[04:53:22] <pacmac> the file is linked good against the html file, because if I do an alert first, the alert works
[04:53:41] <pacmac> and there are a p tag in the html file
[04:53:47] <pacmac> Cork: is it really needed?
[04:53:52] <Cork> pacmac: yes
[04:53:58] <pacmac> ok, wait a moment please
[04:53:59] <Feel> Hello. I see tutrial about ScrollTo(), but I don't understand how to use it. Can somebody give me example?
[04:54:08] <Cork> pacmac: cause the line on its own should work fine
[04:54:20] <pacmac> Cork: http://pastebin.com/sFgJnN2c
[04:54:20] <Cork> so it is the context that has the problem
[04:54:42] <Cork> and where are you running your code?
[04:54:50] <pacmac> in a xampp locally
[04:54:59] <pacmac> with google chrome, latest version
[04:55:47] <Cork> what do you mean locally?
[04:55:49] <Cork> in the console?
[04:56:04] <pacmac> I have xampp installed in the same machine as the code
[04:56:15] <pacmac> and the same machine where i code
[04:56:19] <Cork> and it automatically injects scripts in the html?
[04:56:50] <pacmac> Cork: if I add an alert("test"); first of the jquery code, the alert works
[04:57:04] <Cork> ... but where are your code?
[04:57:10] <pacmac> but if I put the alert after the jquery code, it doesn't works
[04:57:17] <grafi> closed source sorry
[04:57:30] <pacmac> Cork: localhost
[04:57:33] <Cork> ...
[04:57:39] <pacmac> apache server
[04:58:05] <Cork> 1. html, 2. jquery script 3. skip ... 6. doesn't work
[04:58:10] <Cork> i need the steps missing...
[04:58:29] <pacmac> it's in a separate file called jquery.js
[04:58:36] <Cork> ya, jquery sure
[04:58:40] <Cork> and your script?
[04:59:08] <pacmac> in the same dir as the html file
[04:59:29] <Cork> ...
[04:59:37] <grafi> xD
[04:59:42] <Cork> do you even know how webpages load resources?
[05:00:45] <pacmac> Cork: excuse me, I'm in my work and the boss is calling me, could we continue later please?
[05:01:01] <Cork> we haven't even really started
[05:01:04] <pacmac> haha
[05:01:07] <pacmac> thanks
[05:01:10] <pacmac> see you later
[05:01:27] <Cork> pacmac: though thx for saying so instead of just running away

[05:11:20] <Kamuela> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://pubapi.cryptsy.com/api.php?method=singlemarketdata&marketid=71. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.  :(
[05:14:02] <Cork> Kamuela: your running from file:// right?
[05:14:19] <Kamuela> Cork: yeah
[05:14:43] <Cork> well web access will be limited when you run from that
[05:15:13] <Cork> also unless the api you call accepts cross origin you can't access it
[05:15:23] <Cork> (no matter if you run from file or not)
[05:17:44] <Kamuela> Cork: how would you know?
[05:17:55] <Kamuela> Cork: I'm not finding any explicit jsonp references
[05:18:08] <Kamuela> Cork: https://www.cryptsy.com/pages/api
[05:18:14] <Cork> Kamuela: if the server sends a Access-Control-Allow-Origin header back with the call
[05:18:58] <Cork> Kamuela: you most likely need to proxy it over your own server
[05:19:06] <Cork> it's meant to be called from php
[05:19:45] <Kamuela> Cork: that's fancy for if it surrounds it in a function right?
[05:20:02] <Cork> no
[05:20:14] <Kamuela> Cork: i was playing with both that api and mtgox's API, and ?jsonp=etc did something it just didn't work
[05:20:20] <Cork> it means you need to have a php server script that does the request to there api
[05:20:28] <Kamuela> Cork: it wrapped it in etc({}); but the inside had no data
[05:20:29] <Cork> and you need to expose it again to your js
[05:20:47] <Cork> Kamuela: that only works if the server supports jsonp
[05:21:02] <Cork> meaning if the server is meant to be called from js
[05:21:08] <Kamuela> Cork: but notice that it FORMED the callback function, it just didn't fill it with data
[05:24:52] <Kamuela> Cork: whoa! what's this???? http://jsonp.jit.su/
[05:26:15] <Cork> ...
[05:26:52] <Cork> nice yet another developer that doesn't bother to research why those limitations are added...
[05:28:47] <Guest666> Hi there. Anyone know how to call a function in dot notation from a string... var foo = { bar : function() { alert('bar');}} <input type="text" id="val" value="foo.bar" /> var f=$("#val").val(); // f now = "foo.bar" but I can't do f();
[05:31:10] <Kamuela> Cork: as far as i see it, you asked me to write a php script and put it on my server. this php script is on someone else's server. are we just saying that in the event that server was compromised i'd have a security issue?
[05:31:36] <Cork> Kamuela: for one yes
[05:31:45] <Cork> not only that you would have xss problem
[05:32:15] <Cork> and it exposes sites that wasn't meant to be consumed from random pages at risk too
[05:32:26] <Cork> so ya i see plenty of problems with that site
[05:33:21] <miCSu> does .trigger('click') run through click listeners?
[05:33:27] <Cork> yes
[05:33:42] <miCSu> ok, so I'm in an infinite loop
[05:33:50] <Cork> miCSu: but only jquery listeners
[05:33:52] <joroci> hey, how can i select a div with class 'test' but only the one with iframe in it?
[05:33:58] <Cork> miCSu: heh, ya that is possible
[05:34:21] <Cork> joroci: $('.test iframe').closest('.test')
[05:34:40] <Cork> joroci: css can't select on children
[05:34:52] <Cork> so you need to select a child based on the parent, and then look for the parent from there
[05:35:01] <joroci> do you know how to do it using javascript?
[05:35:15] <Kamuela> Cork: do I have an issue with a javascript object using "return" as one of its children?
[05:35:22] <joroci> yea i was thinking maybe there is a better way
[05:35:22] <Cork> joroci: pure javascript would be a bit messy
[05:35:30] <Cork> joroci: there isn't really
[05:35:42] <Cork> set an extra class on the parent that has the iframe
[05:35:48] <Cork> and ignore the existance of the iframe
[05:36:26] <slax0r> Cork: why to the parent of the iframe? wouldn't it work if you gave iframe that class?
[05:36:45] <Cork> slax0r: he wants the parent not the iframe
[05:36:46] <joroci> ok thx
[05:37:04] <Cork> slax0r: the iframe is easy to find without modifying anything
[05:37:20] <slax0r> oh
[05:40:23] <Kamuela> Cork: I escaped the use of return by saying data["return"].etc.etc and then continuing with dot notation
[05:40:49] <Cork> Kamuela: oh, sorry missed your question
[05:40:58] <Cork> Kamuela: yes return is a reserved word
[05:41:03] <Cork> so you need to use it as ['']
[05:41:57] <Cork> Kamuela: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-7.6.1.1
[05:42:05] <Kamuela> Cork: weird quirk, huh?
[05:42:11] <Cork> no not quirk
[05:42:21] <Cork> this is normal for most languages (except ruby)
[05:42:24] <Kamuela> Why isn't it a quirk? Does whitespace mean nothing in javascript?
[05:42:31] <Cork> yes
[05:42:40] <Cork> just like in c and c++ and java
[05:42:45] <Kamuela> so litearlly varhello=3;returnhello; works?
[05:42:53] <slax0r> yes
[05:42:55] <Cork> well no not hellp
[05:42:57] <Kamuela> wtf
[05:43:03] <slax0r> that's what minifiers do
[05:43:03] <Cork> returnhello; would be one command
[05:43:06] <slax0r> they remove all whitespace
[05:43:10] <slax0r> oh, no
[05:43:14] <Cork> slax0r: not all
[05:43:15] <Kamuela> exactly, so is it just whitespace doesn't matter with dots?
[05:43:15] <slax0r> returnhello; wouldn't work
[05:43:31] <Kamuela> hello . next . next thing
[05:43:37] <Kamuela> valid?
[05:43:38] <slax0r> Cork: well those that can get removed, like var a=0;var b=1;
[05:43:45] <slax0r> the whitespace between ; and var
[05:43:53] <Cork> Kamuela: everything that is a command/word delimiter is the same
[05:44:12] <Cork> func(value)  func(    value   )
[05:44:21] <Cork> func(  \n\n\n\n value \n\n\n\n)
[05:44:29] <Cork> the engine doesn't care
[05:44:52] <slax0r> if that wouldn't work, you couldn't span your code across multiple lines, and not indent it either
[05:44:56] <Cork> btw \n here is meant to represent a line break
[05:45:02] <slax0r> that would be weird to read to say the least
[05:45:14] <Cork> slax0r: well indent could work
[05:45:23] <Cork> but it would be like perl where it is mandatory
[05:46:03] <slax0r> Cork: I meant if js wouldn't permit whitespace between commands
[05:46:27] <Cork> slax0r: it would allow it, but it wouldn't collaps them
[05:46:58] <Kamuela> interesting lessons. and good point about anything but ruby btw. i guess you're right. funny also i came here right after doin ruby for a few weeks
[05:47:01] <Cork> the problem would rather be with something like varb = vara + varc; wouldn't be the same as varb=vara+barc;
[05:47:08] <Cork> *varb=vara+varc;
[05:47:24] <Cork> Kamuela: ruby is just mad
[05:47:30] <Cork> you can redefine ANYTHING there
[05:47:48] <Cork> you don't like to use if <value to check>
[05:47:56] <Cork> well redifine it then!
[05:48:00] <Cork> you can even do it dynamically
[05:48:04] <Cork> '>_>
[05:48:35] <Kamuela> typeless, stateless, lessless
[05:48:39] <Cork> heck you can even call functions that doesn't exist
[05:48:47] <Cork> and still have them do something
[05:49:02] <grafi> hm

[05:49:32] <Cork> that is the wackiest part of ruby
[05:58:49] <Kamuela> Cork: so I can console.log the object I just picked up from the ajax json, but i need to use it as a number. i basically deal with undefined when i try to assign it to a variable!
[05:59:27] <Cork> Kamuela: what?
[06:02:16] <Kamuela> Cork: I want to just show you all my code but I'm not ready for you to say "Jesus Christ" yet LOL
[06:02:24] <Cork> lol
[06:02:44] <Kamuela> That being said, Hacks.js is well on its way to almost being functional
[06:07:18] <Kamuela> Cork: ok so basically, i have been testing my ajax calls with console.log. But now that it comes time to store them in variables, i get undefined
[06:09:44] <root__> Hey, jquery. Im loading a script using getScript(). It appears that during the script load, the global variables of the current window are not available. IS this normal? If it is, is there a way to inject the global into the scope of the loading script? or is there some other kind of workaround.
[06:09:58] <root__> Im sure I have done this exact operation many times. Im surprised about this
[06:13:04] <pacmac> Cork: still there?
[06:14:38] <Kamuela> http://jsfiddle.net/y23MD/ price returns as NaN. I'm trying to figure out what I can do
[06:18:22] <Cork> Kamuela: you calling async code
[06:18:28] <Cork> and expect sync code to get it
[06:18:34] <Cork> that won't work
[06:19:00] <Cork> Kamuela: best solution is to use deferred callbacks and $.when
[06:19:46] <Cork> root__: getScript should just add it to the global scope by default
[06:19:57] <Cork> no need to do anything special
[06:21:16] <root__> Cork: so global variables defined *inside* the script being loaded end up in the global scope, but *when* the script is being loaded, the existing global variables are not in its scope.
[06:21:38] <Cork> root__: they should be
[06:21:41] <root__> * *inside* the scriptBeingLoaded
[06:21:47] <root__> Cork: yeah, Ive done this a million times
[06:21:57] <Kamuela> Cork: I think I know what you mean. But that's not the problem. Everything works except for saving the variables. Unless that's exactly waht you mean. Variable saving is sync code
[06:22:10] <root__> I always structure my JS suites with one global variable as a namespace and then varous files load things onto that global
[06:22:16] <root__> I have no idea why this is happening
[06:22:18] <Cork> Kamuela: that is what i mean
[06:22:21] <root__> Ive never seen...
[06:22:22] <root__> oh
[06:22:35] <root__> hmm
[06:23:17] <root__> yeah, I think there must have been an issue with anoth "document" being created inside my html doc, but then why does the Script define Its globals in the glabal namspace of the top level window
[06:23:21] <root__> doesnt make sense
[06:23:35] <Cork> Kamuela: what you get is this: 1. lastBTC and lastQRK defined to undefined, 2. json requested (2x) 3. price calculated, 4. price returned, 5. lastBTC and lastQRK set from the callback to the json calls
[06:23:58] <Cork> Kamuela: remember network calls are async (and should be), so you need to wait for them
[06:24:21] <Cork> Kamuela: it also means you can't do return price though
[06:24:29] <Kamuela> Cork: so I should look at when() to synchronize a received call?
[06:25:07] <Cork> well to wait for the two calls to come back
[06:25:11] <Cork> it won't syncronize the code
[06:25:21] <Cork> it will just give you a new callback for both responses
[06:28:42] <Cork> Kamuela: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/y23MD/1/
[06:29:05] <Cork> opps some alinement errors
[06:29:30] <Cork> Kamuela: http://jsfiddle.net/y23MD/2/
[06:32:26] <Kamuela> Cork: can you help walk me through what happens starting with the when? does when() just take function calls as arguments?
[06:33:47] <Kamuela> Cork: also difference between done() and then() ? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[06:40:24] <Cork> Kamuela: have you used .done and .fail before?
[06:40:29] <Cork> (and .always)
[06:40:46] <Kamuela> Cork: nope this is my first week of javascript/jquery
[06:42:02] <Cork> ok
[06:42:15] <Cork> ?api jQuery.deferred
[06:42:15] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:42:21] * Cork hits b-ot 
[06:42:46] <Cork> Kamuela: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[06:42:53] <Cork> deferred is another way to write callbacks
[06:42:53] <pacmac> Cork: I think now I understand what you were saying before.. you mean the jquery file, not my own jquery code
[06:43:10] <Cork> Kamuela: .done on ajax calls does the same as success: does
[06:43:18] <Cork> Kamuela: .fail same as error:
[06:43:19] <doev> is a ; in a id a problem?
[06:43:30] <Cork> kam270: and .always same as completed:
[06:43:33] <Cork> opps
[06:43:34] <Cork> *Kamuela:
[06:43:51] <Cork> Kamuela: $.when lets you collect all these values into on big callback handler
[06:43:54] <Kamuela> Cork: why is the example using when and then?
[06:45:01] <Cork> Kamuela: hmm not fully sure
[06:45:11] <Cork> i don't think you need .then() for this case
[06:45:25] <Cork> ah
[06:45:34] <Cork> Kamuela: then is a combination of done and fail
[06:45:53] <Cork> kinda like hover is a combination of mouseover and mouseout
[06:47:02] <Kamuela> so like, "no matter what happened, do this now"
[06:47:13] <Kamuela> we know it's no longer in a pending state for sure
[06:47:15] <Cork> no
[06:47:21] <Cork> that is always
[06:47:43] <Cork> .then(function() {}, function() {}) is the same as .done(function() {}).fail(function() {})
[06:48:10] <nasonet> Good morning !!!!!!
[06:48:51] <nasonet> Someone know how to check if a input text is char or integer?
[06:49:11] <Kamuela> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/72chv/ I get undefined for data[1]["return"]
[06:49:16] <nasonet> for example in php is with " is_int()  "
[06:49:56] <Cork> hmm right i think i might have messed up there a bit
[06:50:18] <Cork> yup
[06:50:27] <Uhkis> nasonet: typeof(variable)
[06:50:38] <Kamuela> Cork: i think it's still doing that async/sync mismatch because both btc and qrk are undefined
[06:50:42] <Cork> kam270: http://jsfiddle.net/72chv/1/
[06:50:44] <Cork> *Kamuela:
[06:51:03] <Cork> Kamuela: ya, cause of my mistake
[06:51:09] <Cork> it wasn't an array
[06:51:12] <Cork> it is separate arguments
[06:51:32] <Cork> Kamuela: and you moved price out of the callback
[06:51:37] <Cork> Kamuela: that won't work
[06:52:09] <Cork> annoyed kam270 too much :)
[06:52:38] <Kamuela> Hahaha
[06:52:47] <Cork> Kamuela: check the difference between your and this one http://jsfiddle.net/y23MD/3/
[06:54:08] <seutje> capitalized keys are so awkward
[06:54:29] <Cork> seutje: there is?
[06:54:36] <Cork> *they are
[06:54:38] <seutje> just imo
[06:55:11] <Cork> if you mean all ucase, then ya i agree
[06:55:19] <Cork> camelcase is fine
[06:55:21] <seutje> but I also dislike how some OS's capitalize certain "important" folder names
[06:55:27] <seutje> oh sure
[06:55:38] <seutje> but like .markets.QRK.lasttradeprice
[06:55:43] <Kamuela> Cork: interestingly enough, when i use data, data[0] doesn't give me an issue. data[1] does. data1, data2, data1 gives me an issue
[06:55:51] <seutje> I'd make that .markets.qrk.lastTradePrice
[06:55:52] <Cork> i remembered having big problems with windows BOOL
[06:56:01] <Cork> where false was FALSE and true was TRUE
[06:56:05] <Cork> drove me nuts
[06:56:14] <seutje> oh lol
[06:56:21] <seutje> php does that as well, doesn't it?
[06:56:30] <Cork> ya
[06:56:32] <seutje> cause they're  secretly constants or some fucked up shit
[06:56:36] <Kamuela> seutje: it's QRK because they are thinking of it as a ticker
[06:57:03] <seutje> isn't all stock shit in capitals?
[06:57:27] <seutje> so might as well be none, no distinction
[06:57:28] <Cork> Kamuela: if you console.log(data1, data2) is data2 undefined?
[06:58:06] <Cork> ugg dubble error >_<
[06:58:25] <Cork> Kamuela: http://jsfiddle.net/y23MD/4/
[06:58:28] <Cork> that one should work
[06:58:44] <Cork> been a bit too long since i used when().done()
[07:00:07] <Kamuela> Cork: see now that's something that's just random test. random test. random test, it works! there's no way to know that
[07:00:19] <Kamuela> Cork: that being said, it doesn't like multiplying them together
[07:00:31] <Kamuela> Cork: no, it does
[07:00:35] <Cork> Kamuela: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/#entry-examples
[07:00:37] <Cork> not random
[07:00:47] <Cork> i actually had to look it up at the end :)
[07:02:00] <Kamuela> Cork: is there an issue with returning a value there? the rest of my code doesn't seem to like it
[07:02:04] <Kamuela> Cork: but all of your part works 100%
[07:02:14] <Cork> Kamuela: you can't return the value, like i said
[07:02:19] <Cork> the code is async
[07:02:31] <Cork> the calling function will END before the callback happens
[07:02:56] <Cork> it is even guaranteed to end before the callback fires
[07:04:58] <Kamuela> Cork: but can i set a variable in an outer scope to price?
[07:05:52] <Cork> Kamuela: sure, but if you needed it as a return it won't be accessible until it is too late
[07:14:06] <Kamuela> Cork: now I don't want to update the widget until I have my first value. how should I think abotu thsi problem?
[07:14:32] <Cork> Kamuela: just handle it in the callback
[07:16:04] <Kamuela> Cork: oh my gawd
[07:16:28] <Cork> ?
[07:18:04] <Kamuela> Just that you're a genius. That's all
[07:18:07] <Kamuela> Works without flaw
[07:18:19] <BillCriswell> Whooaaa don't jinx yourself.
[07:18:33] <Kamuela> I cannot do such a thing. Not with Cork
[07:18:37] <Kamuela> He is power
[07:20:31] <BillCriswell> I can't decide what Stack Overflow hat I want to wear today.
[07:22:57] <Kamuela> BillCriswell: borrow mine. "useless"
[07:23:07] <wroos> Ìû
[07:27:00] <BillCriswell> Kamuela: Haha
[07:27:05] <BillCriswell> I don't think I have that one.... yet.
[07:28:23] <krz> what does this mean: Cannot call method 'toString' of undefined
[07:34:54] <baseline> What's the best method to find out if a device is touch capable?
[07:35:35] <baseline> I've got some parallax effects that are a bit laggy when scrolling with touch events
[07:36:49] <BillCriswell> baseline: ('ontouchstart' in window) has worked for me.
[07:37:00] <BillCriswell> baseline: If you're using modernizr might be a class already there for it.
[07:38:34] <BillCriswell> Modernizr.touch I think?
[07:39:10] <BillCriswell> This thing I'm trying to do is just not happening.
[07:39:25] <grafi> poor you
[07:39:33] <BillCriswell> grafi: I know.
[07:39:36] <grafi> :P
[07:39:41] <BillCriswell> Damn computer needs the directions to clear.
[07:39:45] <BillCriswell> too*
[07:40:26] <grafi> What are we trying to do?
[07:40:27] <grafi> xD
[07:40:35] <baseline> dude ignore the computer
[07:40:49] <grafi> disregard
[07:40:50] <grafi> :P
[07:40:52] <baseline> I write my code with a pen and paper then hand it to the boss.
[07:41:04] <BillCriswell> Let the nerds figure out that stuff!
[07:41:06] <baseline> it's much faster
[07:41:08] <baseline> for me.
[07:41:14] <grafi> "the gui is all in your head"
[07:41:18] <grafi> thats a feature
[07:41:51] <BillCriswell> grafi: You don't use iOS so I'm not sure I can point you to an example. Basically, the quicker I scroll the more I want these elements in a list spaced out.
[07:42:18] <BillCriswell> so as the scrolling slows down they get closer together.
[07:43:00] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/OMUnacIL/2/edit?js,output This is where I'm at with it haha.
[07:43:14] <baseline> nice idea
[07:43:16] <grafi> i have an ipad :P
[07:43:19] <grafi> because im hip
[07:43:20] <grafi> ^^
[07:43:29] <baseline> I'm not sure if the scroll events are reported rapidly enough for that to be a smooth animation
[07:43:59] <BillCriswell> baseline: The bigger issue I think is the scrolling.
[07:44:11] <baseline> ahh
[07:44:36] <BillCriswell> baseline: Like, the scroll bars and the calculated height and shit.
[07:44:44] <BillCriswell> grafi: In the text message conversation view if you scroll fast you'll see them space out a bit.
[07:44:57] <baseline> I guess you could add a sensible amount of padding to the bottom of the list and remove it as you increase padding between LIs
[07:45:31] <grafi> i wonder
[07:45:37] <grafi> why would you ever do this xD
[07:46:19] <baseline> I understand why
[07:46:24] <grafi> i dont
[07:46:26] <grafi> :p
[07:46:29] <baseline> because he can
[07:46:39] <grafi> its pretty obvious to me that he cant
[07:46:40] <grafi> :D
[07:46:45] <baseline> and you never know what might be the next lightbox :D
[07:46:56] <grafi> not that
[07:46:57] <grafi> im sure
[07:47:02] <baseline> probably not
[07:47:05] <BillCriswell> baseline: Yeah, The height is still changing though which makes it gross.
[07:47:21] <BillCriswell> I could maybe do something with a rapper and overflow hidden?
[07:47:25] <BillCriswell> wrapper*
[07:47:27] <baseline> BillCriswell: sounds like you need a maximum amount of LI padding
[07:47:28] <BillCriswell> hahah rapper.
[07:47:30] <grafi> ask eminem
[07:47:30] <grafi> ^^
[07:48:39] <baseline> overflow: hidden; will be erratic if you're at the top or bottom of the list, I can't imagine a way around that
[07:49:06] <baseline> oh
[07:49:20] <baseline> maybe you can use css3 transforms to space out the LIs rather than padding?
[07:49:24] <BillCriswell> grafi: I just wanted to accomplsih it haha.
[07:49:35] <grafi> good enough :P
[07:49:37] <BillCriswell> baseline: I'm using transforms on the padding.
[07:50:11] <baseline> BillCriswell: the jsbin you put here has transition?
[07:50:24] <BillCriswell> It was commented out in the CSS.
[07:50:47] <baseline> transform: translateX(2em)
[07:51:18] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/OMUnacIL/3/edit?css,js,output seems a little closer?
[07:51:24] <BillCriswell> baseline: Not too familiar with that one.
[07:51:42] <baseline> if you wanted to go totally nuts you could actually use transform: scale to achieve a 'zoom out' effect relative to the amount of space between LIs
[07:51:54] <baseline> thereby keeping the list the same height
[07:52:06] <baseline> visa vi
[07:52:16] <grafi> oO
[07:52:17] <BillCriswell> Would that be like scaling?
[07:52:22] <grafi> that sounds cool ^^
[07:52:22] <baseline> ergo no
[07:52:32] <baseline> yes
[07:52:34] <baseline> it would
[07:53:14] <baseline> so when you scroll it would look like each element if moving further away, each line of text gets smaller but the distance between them actually stays the same. as you slow down it looks like they're getting closer.
[07:53:15] <BillCriswell> Wouldn't that not effect the elements around it though?
[07:53:32] <baseline> not with css transforms, if done properly
[07:53:42] <baseline> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
[07:55:32] <BillCriswell> I'll have to look into that.
[07:56:17] <baseline> I wouldn't want to write it.
[07:57:20] <BillCriswell> baseline: Haha. I think making it as smooth as I'd like it going to be a pain in the ass.
[07:59:08] <baseline> yeah, what you're doing is going to be quite laggy
[08:00:14] <grafi> xD
[08:00:16] <BillCriswell> Yeah, might be able to get away with it if there's a few lis but not too many.
[08:02:00] <BillCriswell> I wonder if just doing like $('#some-style-tag').html('li { padding: newpaddingpx }'); would be faster.
[08:02:07] <grafi> hm
[08:02:29] <grafi> lol
[08:02:36] <grafi> the effect is just funny ^^
[08:06:40] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/OMUnacIL/7/edit doesn't seem like much of a difference lol
[08:06:41] <pedrommone> sup guys
[08:07:46] <pedrommone> can someone help me with datatables?
[08:09:21] <baseline> BillCriswell: you could css skew the body
[08:09:39] <baseline> stretch it out vertically
[08:10:01] <BillCriswell> baseline: Ahhhhhh
[08:10:12] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure I'm still interested in this problem.
[08:10:36] <BillCriswell> I have random bursts of interest and this may have ended.
[08:10:47] <BillCriswell> That does sound much more efficient.
[08:11:00] <grafi> xD
[08:11:21] <grafi> so BillCriswell what do we do now ^^
[08:11:56] <baseline> dude, do it
[08:12:02] <baseline> I want to see it now
[08:12:06] <baseline> >D
[08:12:10] <baseline> >:D
[08:22:08] <BillCriswell> baseline: Haha, one da.
[08:22:10] <BillCriswell> one day*
[08:23:00] <BillCriswell> I need to mess around with the transform stuff more though, that's for sure.
[08:23:26] <drager> How can I add one div "around" every image tag in a $each when I add the image in the each.
[08:23:56] <Whirl3d> drager, huh?
[08:24:23] <drager> Whirl3d: Let me show.
[08:24:35] <grafi> ?api wrap
[08:24:35] <b-ot> grafi: .wrap(): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[08:24:57] <Benni_Hanna> $(selector).each(function() { $(target).append('<div><img/></div>); })
[08:25:16] <Benni_Hanna> something like that?
[08:25:48] <drager> Benni_Hanna: Yeah, I did that but I think wrap() will be more likely better
[08:26:00] <Whirl3d> $(selector).each(function (i) { var img=$(this); img.wrap("<div class='imageWrapper'></div>");});
[08:26:00] <Benni_Hanna> ya if the img is already existing
[08:28:04] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d why the each?
[08:28:31] <drager> BinaryKitten: I have a each.
[08:28:33] <Whirl3d> the original question was "in an $each"  so I did what the question asked
[08:29:01] <Whirl3d> I assumed there were other things done in the $.each, that's why I cached "this"
[08:29:14] <BinaryKitten> ahh ok..
[08:29:25] <BinaryKitten> was going to say that $(selector).wrap("<div class='imageWrapper'></div>"); would do the same  as that without the looping
[08:29:38] <BinaryKitten> (well without the looping outside the jquery core)
[08:30:12] <Whirl3d> I figured that inside the each, some would and some wouldn't get wrapped. Perhaps something that was hard to select for or dynamic in nature...
[08:30:26] <maxmoore14> any jqm people here? really weird/specific question...
[08:30:37] <BinaryKitten> ?ask
[08:30:37] <b-ot> BinaryKitten: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:31:30] <maxmoore14> I have a JQM app on a subdomain (app.domain.com)...
[08:31:40] <maxmoore14> my index.html is my login page
[08:31:59] <maxmoore14> specifically when used on-device on an iPad
[08:32:50] <maxmoore14> with Safari, when I login, I get a prompt to save the password - I tap Not Now - and rather than the form submitting as normal, I get redirected to domain.com
[08:33:24] <maxmoore14> kinda like the browser is trying to refresh the page but some weird bug is truncating the subdomain
[08:34:01] <Whirl3d> does it happen when you tap Not Now or after selecting Not Now, when you click Submit?
[08:35:00] <maxmoore14> Whirl3d: I type email/password - tap Login - get prompted by Safari to save password, tap Not Now
[08:35:59] <maxmoore14> is it possible to use weinre or something to remote debug and step through the javascript?
[08:37:03] <maxmoore14> I've tried every desktop browser I could, android devices, iphone is fine, even Chrome on the ipad is fine - it is just Safari/iPad
[08:37:09] <drager> Whirl3d: Yeah, it is a $.getJSON() then a $.each() of the data inside it.
[08:38:30] <Whirl3d> drager, if you are wrapping all the images returned in $.getJSON(), you can just use .wrap on the data returned rather than stepping through it
[08:39:15] <drager> Whirl3d: Hm, this is how I've done; https://dpaste.de/4gyn
[08:40:27] <drager> Whirl3d: I want a div wrapping every image.
[08:40:36] <drager> one div for one img
[08:40:49] <drager> so I can display them nicely
[08:41:27] <slax0r> without a div, you can't?
[08:41:48] <drager> slax0r: ?
[08:42:08] <Whirl3d> drager, you are appending the image , not imagE1.
[08:42:16] <slax0r> you want to display imgs nicely, without a div, you can't display them nicely?
[08:42:37] <Whirl3d> actually, you are re-wrapping all of your images every time.
[08:42:43] <drager> Whirl3d: Yeah
[08:43:11] <drager> Whirl3d: Now it's one div in one div as long as the array are
[08:43:17] <drager> the lenght
[08:46:05] <Whirl3d> I replied to your paste, try that
[08:47:53] <Whirl3d> Woops. I just replied again. I forgot to add the holder to the self.displayImage() function.
[08:48:14] <drager> Sweet
[08:48:15] <drager> Thanks
[08:49:32] <Whirl3d> maxmoore14, Sorry I am at a loss. Sounds like a safari bug, but I don't know any workaround.
[08:49:55] <maxmoore14> Whirl3d: yeah, thanks though
[08:50:28] <maxmoore14> Whirl3d: any thoughts on a good way to test/debug?
[08:51:45] <Whirl3d> maxmoore14, I would probably try to make a limited use example. Try just your basic form with password and see if it does the same thing. Also what about using something in HTML to indicate the correct subdomain?
[08:52:08] <pbodymind> hello... any1 knowns a nice jquery XMPP plugin?
[08:52:15] <Whirl3d> <base href='sub.domain.com'> or something similar. I can't remember the exact HTML, but I think it's base
[08:52:33] <maxmoore14> I'll look into that, thanks
[08:52:43] <Whirl3d> let us know if that works.
[08:56:12] <verymickey> hey guys. sorry to both with this but i can't seem to figure it out
[08:56:23] <verymickey> I am getting this warning message in chrome " event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead."
[08:56:29] <verymickey> using query 1.10
[08:56:52] <verymickey> everything works fine in FF
[08:57:06] <verymickey> any ideas whats this is about
[08:57:24] <verymickey> site is live if that helps
[08:59:43] <NoiseEee> verymickey: well are you using "event.returnValue " in your code?
[08:59:45] <baseline> verymickey: search your js files for event.returnValue
[09:01:31] <verymickey> noiseEee baseline i did search for it, ill do it again
[09:03:26] <NoiseEee> verymickey: perhaps one of your plugins is using it.
[09:04:57] <verymickey> NoiseEee yea i just saw a plugin was loading v1.8 so i updated it to 1.20
[09:05:00] <verymickey> er 1.10
[09:05:25] <verymickey> console is showing that 1.10 is the using returnValue
[09:05:39] <maxmoore14> verymickey: the 2.x branch of jquery doesn't have that problem
[09:05:58] <NoiseEee> verymickey: well jquery should really only be loaded once.
[09:06:15] <maxmoore14> if you need 1.x nothing to do about it as far as I know
[09:06:21] <verymickey> I have not done anything with 2.x.. major changes? lot of code on my end to update?
[09:06:42] <maxmoore14> if you look at the error line - it is actually in the jquery library
[09:06:59] <maxmoore14> 2.x drops support for older browsers
[09:07:19] <verymickey> hm.
[09:07:24] <verymickey> frustrating but ok
[09:07:52] <maxmoore14> it is just a console warning - not a breaking bug - safe to ignore I would say
[09:08:22] <verymickey> yea.. maybe its something else in my code that isn't working on chrom
[09:08:40] <verymickey> because other jquery funciotnatliy is working
[09:08:55] <maxmoore14> it is not an error
[09:09:13] <sharpy35_> Hey, is it possible in IE10 to use Server Sent Events (EventSOurce in IE10+?+
[09:09:15] <maxmoore14> it is just chrome telling you that it will become an error some day in the future
[09:09:38] <maxmoore14> it is a deprecated feature, not a removed feature
[09:09:57] <verymickey> maxmoore14 ah then it must be an error on my end.
[09:10:15] <verymickey> do you see anything horribly wrong with http://bin.cakephp.org/view/445341923 ?
[09:10:45] <maxmoore14> what error are you getting?
[09:11:50] <verymickey> no error. just nothing logging
[09:14:26] <maxmoore14> can you setup some working code on http://jsbin.com/
[09:14:36] <verymickey> ya hang on
[09:19:55] <tyler1> hey i'm doing some testing on speed, and i'm noticing that $(document).on('tap', '.open-menu', function(e) {  is performing faster than $('.menu').on('tap', '.open-menu', function(e) {   â€¦ does this make any sense?  (.open-menu is an element in .menu)
[09:21:43] <verymickey> maxmoore14 http://jsbin.com/amoXATeC/1/
[09:22:24] <verymickey> maxmoore14 works in ff not in chrome
[09:23:35] <maxmoore14> yeah, I see that
[09:23:53] <petey> Hello friends. I have a question about some jquery attaching a margin-top attribute to an h3 tag. I would usually "break on attribute modification" in chrome, but this is just added there by default. Any idea how I can trace thsi back?
[09:24:24] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ verymickey
[09:24:39] <maxmoore14> verymickey: it is logging though - you aren't getting any errors - the calculations are being done
[09:25:00] <maxmoore14> verymickey: looks like an issue with the opacity
[09:25:15] <maxmoore14> could even be a css thing
[09:25:34] <verymickey> noiseEee thanks for the link, ill give it a read
[09:25:59] <maxmoore14> have you checked caniuse.com
[09:26:03] <verymickey> maxmoore14 ok thanks ill do some googling and see if i can't find some info about opacity in chrome
[09:26:10] <verymickey> ill check that out right now
[09:29:05] <maxmoore14> verymickey: actually, I don't think that is it
[09:29:09] <maxmoore14> one sec
[09:29:18] <verymickey> maxmoore14 yea was just reading some articles that say opacity should be fine
[09:31:31] <maxmoore14> found your bug...
[09:31:41] <maxmoore14> should be var currentPos = $(this).scrollTop();
[09:31:53] <maxmoore14> not $('html')
[09:32:33] <verymickey> and just like that its working
[09:32:45] <verymickey> thanks maxmoore14
[09:32:53] <maxmoore14> np
[09:35:20] <petey> Is $('.branded-filter input') faster than ('.branded-filter).children('input') ?
[09:38:58] <synth_> O.O
[09:40:17] <NoiseEee> petey: they're different selectors and would return different things.
[09:42:20] <NoiseEee> petey: the first would get you all inputs beneath the elements with the .branded-filter class; the second would retrieve inputs that are only direct descendants of those elements
[09:42:23] <petey> what if its <div class="branded-filter"><input></div>
[09:42:45] <petey> Ah okay. That makes more sense.
[09:44:06] <petey> Thank you NoiseEee
[09:44:11] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[09:49:16] <fabioportieri> bye
[09:58:43] <Lope2> is there some kind of .notEmpty() method on input elements?
[09:59:56] <ulipo1991> hi everyone
[10:00:14] <ulipo1991> does anybody have experience with the simplecart js plugin?
[10:00:24] <ulipo1991> i really need some help :/
[10:01:26] <ulipo1991> i've been searching in google a lot and forums about how to use 2 checkout form, but i just don't understand it how
[10:02:24] <petey_> Is there a case where you don't need to end with a semicolon?
[10:02:39] <petey_> I have a $('.moving').slideDown() with no semicolon at the edn
[10:02:41] <petey_> end*
[10:02:59] <petey_> as I'm sifting through this code
[10:03:23] <_rgn> you may not have to always end a line in semicolon
[10:03:45] <_rgn> but it's a good habit to do so, barring few exceptions (for loops, function foo() {})
[10:04:11] <petey_> Ah cool. That makes sense, thanks.
[10:06:23] <jrajav> Lope2: Not really, just do .val() !== ''
[10:06:56] <jrajav> Lope2: Or $.trim($('.myselector').val()) !== '' if you want to count only spaces and tabs as still being "empty"
[10:19:08] <Lope2> okay cool
[10:19:17] <Lope2> thanks
[10:21:56] <wenzhixue> why the request type is still OPTIONS, even I set crossDomain:True in $.ajax ?
[10:42:23] <ulipo1991> anyone has ever used this plugin: http://simplecartjs.org/documentation/simplecart-checkout ?
[10:46:22] <ravigehlot> I am using animate in a very strange way. I have an <img tag that is outputing an image. Using jquery, I switch that image to another image on hover. Animate is then used to fadeIn and text is added to the box. I had to make the text box a z-index of 9999. So it wouldn't be affected by hover. When I hover over, animate suffers from z-index causing a jumpy effect when hovering.
[10:46:58] <ravigehlot> wouldn't be affected by opacity*
[10:47:10] <ravigehlot> How can I fix that?
[10:54:29] <Lope2> var fields = {}; now how can I loop over all fields with class foo and add their values to fields with the key being element.getAttribute('data-f'); ?
[10:55:31] <daniel_le> Hi
[10:56:14] <daniel_le> Is it possible to check dynamically if a string is also a jquery function?
[10:56:23] <daniel_le> eval("$.fn." + functionName) works, but I would like to avoid eval()
[10:57:40] <Lope2> if (typeof foo==='string') || ((typeof foo==='function)&&(typeof foo()==='string)) ?
[10:58:32] <Lope2> looks like .each will do what I need.
[10:58:37] <Lope2> new to jQuery here.
[10:58:43] <Lope2> I've avoided it forever :p
[10:59:37] <daniel_le> Well, let me explain the problem. I have a class called Map(). Then I have a class called Marker. And then there is a function called Map.addMarker. I would like to do something like that: Map.addMarker(Marker, "fadeIn")
[11:00:02] <daniel_le> Therefor I need to check if "fadeIn" is a valid jquery function
[11:04:17] <Lope2> how can I use javascript stuff on a jQuery object?
[11:04:38] <Lope2> how can I get an attribute of an element? like javascript getAttrubute()
[11:04:41] <daniel_le> $.isFunction(window["$.fn."+myString]) doesn't work either
[11:05:13] <daniel_le> Lope2: $("a#hello").attr("href")
[11:05:40] <Lope2> thanks :)
[11:06:05] <daniel_le> you can use javascript stuff on a jQuery object by.. just doing it
[11:06:19] <daniel_le> $("a").myregularjavascript
[11:10:22] <daniel_le> jQuery.fn[myString] that works of course.. damn it! ;)
[11:11:21] <f0ster> is there anyway i can trigger a click on an element, from inside of another elements click callback ?
[11:11:29] <f0ster> it doesnt seem to be working
[11:15:29] <skypce> hello guys
[11:15:37] <skypce> i want move a div inside other
[11:15:38] <skypce>   $('.views-slideshow-controls-bottom').appendTo(".views_slideshow_cycle_slide");
[11:15:43] <NoiseEee> f0ster: look into trigger()
[11:15:47] <skypce> what is wrong with this please?
[11:17:28] <f0ster> NoiseEee: not sure why it doesnt work.. solved my problem by doing setTimeout(function(){ $(obgj).trigger('click'); }, 100); instead.. though that seems really ghetto
[11:19:10] <NoiseEee> f0ster: perhaps the element wasn't there yet?
[11:19:45] <daniel_le> f0ster: did you use $(function(){ // your code here }); ?
[11:19:50] <f0ster> NoiseEee: no it is definitely there, i am trying to disable a second group of radio buttons, and force select a certain one,  depending on the radio button value of a different group.
[11:19:52] <f0ster> daniel_le: yes
[11:20:40] <f0ster> so basically i have .. $('input .groupone').change( ... if stuff, $('label.from-other-group-that-needs-to-be-force-selected').trigger('click') );
[11:20:58] <f0ster> which didnt work, but if i wrap the trigger ina  timeout so it happens when it isnt inside of the original click handler, it works fine
[11:22:02] <f0ster> just doesnt work form inside of the other elements event stack or somethign
[11:22:22] <daniel_le> why are you triggering a click on a label? just use $("#teh_radio_button").prop("checked", true)
[11:24:01] <f0ster> idk because it wasnt working, though i didnt realize it was because of the event propogation or something
[11:24:22] <f0ster> any reason why this selector wouldnt work in css? input[type='radio'][disabled='disabled'], works in jquery but styles not applied from stylsheet
[11:24:28] <f0ster> daniel_le: i will change to that
[11:25:33] <f0ster> daniel_le: that works without the setTimeout
[11:25:41] <daniel_le> Cool
[11:27:24] <daniel_le> did you try input[type='radio'][disabled] ?
[11:27:56] <f0ster> no.. not familiar with that css let me see
[11:28:33] <daniel_le> I think the problem might be the html markup and not the css
[11:29:35] <daniel_le> I'm not sure if disabled="disabled" really exists or if it's just there because of the W3C validator and in reality the browser is just using <input disabled/>
[11:29:38] <daniel_le> But I'm just guessing
[11:29:43] <f0ster> ah, well actually i am trying to apply it to a label, so it is, input[type="radio"][disabled]+
[11:37:02] <Kamuela> xec: ended up getting around jsonp with jsonp jiujitsu
[11:38:06] <dcrockferd> Does anybody know if jquery's ajax function automatically generates the 'content-length' header for you when you do a POST request?
[11:42:37] <Lope2> how can I check if my radio element $(this) is selected?
[11:43:04] <Criten> Lope2, isn't it just $(this).prop('selected')
[11:43:32] <Lope2> ah, its 'checked' for radios. not 'selected'
[11:43:33] <Criten> I know that's what it is for checkboxes :P
[11:43:41] <Criten> there ya go :)
[11:43:55] <Lope2> ah I'm using attr() is it okay to use it in place of prop?
[11:44:13] <Lope2> whats the diff?
[11:44:33] <Criten> Lope2, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874652/prop-vs-attr
[11:51:21] <lorfds> i have a link with class="a". i have a click event attached to this link $(".a").click()â€¦.. once that specific link is clicked, i want to remove the a class, and attach the "b" class, which then has an $("b").click() handler
[11:51:46] <lorfds> 				$(this).removeClass("a").off('click').addClass("b").on('click', '.chooseImage').text('Show Images');
[11:52:10] <lorfds> the class is being switched correctly, but i can't get the b onclick event to attach
[11:52:39] <Velveeta> does that link have child elements of class chooseImage?
[11:53:07] <lorfds> no
[11:53:18] <lorfds> that was something i added to try to get it to work
[11:53:28] <lorfds> $(this).removeClass("a").off('click').addClass("b").on('click').text('Show Images');
[11:53:32] <lorfds> that didn't work either
[11:54:06] <lorfds> .chooseImage == b
[11:54:17] <lorfds> i just simplified for example purposes
[11:54:22] <Velveeta> well, that *should* work as it's written, can you put up a jsfiddle example?
[11:54:45] <lorfds> yeah i will in a second
[12:05:06] <dekiss> this wil lreturn the lement id? $(this).id ?
[12:13:00] <BillCriswell> dekiss: No.
[12:13:12] <BillCriswell> You'd want either this.id or $(this).attr('id').
[12:13:44] <BillCriswell> Maybe even $(this)[0].id or $(this).get(0).id .... but if you have this already might as well use it.
[12:18:46] <dekiss> when I click one elment all images goes with opacity 0 with animate how can I make just the one image that I clicked to not go with opacity 0 but to stay shown?
[12:21:01] <NoiseEee> dekiss: depends on your code / ie: create a fiddle
[12:21:51] <lorfds> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/Rt5qb/
[12:22:27] <Velveeta> taking a look now
[12:22:48] <lorfds> the chooseImage click event isn't binding when i switch out the classâ€¦prob just missing something obvious, but not sure what it is
[12:23:48] <Velveeta> lorfds: you're not actually binding up the click event there, you're just saying .on('click')
[12:24:13] <lorfds> hmmmâ€¦okâ€¦.i thought .on bound the event automatically
[12:24:17] <Velveeta> nopers
[12:24:17] <lorfds> how do i bind the event?
[12:24:24] <Velveeta> so there are 2 ways, i'll show you both
[12:24:46] <lorfds> ok cool
[12:25:15] <dipser> .on('click', fn)
[12:27:16] <Cache_Money1> I have a button that can only be clicked if another div is highlighted.  Are there any good ways to indicate to the user when they click that button that it was successful?
[12:27:20] <dekiss> how can I animate marginLeft - of the element current marginLeft?
[12:27:32] <Velveeta> lorfds: here's the first way: http://jsfiddle.net/Rt5qb/1/
[12:27:48] <dekiss> is this correct syntax? marginLeft: marginLeft-85,
[12:28:40] <Velveeta> lorfds: here's the other way: http://jsfiddle.net/Rt5qb/2/
[12:29:02] <Velveeta> dekiss: you can use -= syntax also: marginLeft: '-=85px'
[12:30:15] <Velveeta> lorfds: the difference between the 2 is that 1 is a direct binding, you bind your listener to one element type, then on click, remove that class, strip the click, add the other class, and directly bind the new listener for it
[12:30:31] <dekiss> how can I animate maginLeft so it is equal to current marginLeft-80 and additional -60
[12:30:58] <lorfds> so with this, it's basically just a toggle, correct? $(document)
[12:30:58] <lorfds>      .on('click', '.testing', testingClick)
[12:30:59] <lorfds>      .on('click', '.chooseImage', chooseImageClick);
[12:31:02] <Velveeta> lorfds: the other is an example of the old .live() behavior, you attach a iistener to the document, to only fire for certain element selectors (.testing and .chooseImage), and in the testingClick handler, just swap out the class name
[12:31:08] <Velveeta> yepyep
[12:31:16] <lorfds> ok cool. thanks for your help
[12:31:19] <Velveeta> no problemo
[12:31:36] <Velveeta> dekiss: wouldn't that just be something like marginLeft: '-=140px' ?
[12:38:15] <Lope2> how can I get a javascript object reference from a jquery object?
[12:38:38] <Lope2> $('#foo').?
[12:40:13] <Lope2> got it :p
[12:40:55] <dekiss> any idea why img element won't go at the most left? I have left 0px andmargin-left 0px but still sint in the most left in its parent?
[12:42:27] <dekiss> nevermind found
[12:42:32] <dekiss> why if I change position of an image
[12:42:38] <dekiss> whilke it is in animation animations dont happen
[12:43:04] <NoiseEee> dekiss: because animation isn't some fancy magic thing, it works by *changing the position*
[12:43:08] <dekiss> how can I change position of img element from relative to absolute before it goes in animation?
[12:43:37] <NoiseEee> dekiss: your question has the answer
[12:44:00] <NoiseEee> ie: change the css?
[12:45:52] <dekiss> but if I do then aniamtion isnt animation
[12:46:01] <dekiss> I mean I see changes in the animation instantly
[12:46:05] <dekiss> without animation
[12:46:23] <dekiss> I mean I need to change psoitio with javascript
[12:46:26] <dekiss> before animation happens
[12:46:34] <dekiss> callback
[12:46:42] <dekiss> how can I call animate like callback
[12:46:55] <dekiss> so when lement is clicked first it changes position then it goes into animate
[12:46:59] <dekiss> so it ggoes one by one
[12:51:49] <NoiseEee> dekiss: jsfiddle.
[12:51:53] <NoiseEee> for the 150th time.
[13:01:40] <datarecal> hey guy's trying to dynamically set form fields i have a list of ids that will be changed via jquery and need to test what type of input field it is, text,select,radio etc im using: var inputType = $('#'+k).attr('type'); but its showing undefined if the id is a select. is there a better way ?
[13:03:07] <Cache_Money1> Why is it so hard to get more than one Javascript framework into JSFiddle.net?
[13:04:40] <NoiseEee> datarecal: i'd query all those things specifically and figure out the tag name.  ie $('select,input,textarea')  etc
[13:05:48] <Cache_Money1> I just want jQuery and jQueryUI, is that too much to ask?   http://jsfiddle.net/522mh/
[13:05:59] <datarecal> NoiseEee sorry not following what ur saying, get all the selects in one query inputs in one query and see if the id exists in the array ?

[13:25:02] <dekiss> thanks all guys
[13:25:04] <dekiss> and sorry
[13:26:59] <Serdar> do someone know how to get the code for notify! of http://www.greepit.com/notify/#?
[13:28:06] <xp_prg3> I have such a weird question, I have an id of a field in a form, but I can't tell what form it belongs to
[13:28:17] <xp_prg3>  $('#copy_from');
[13:28:29] <xp_prg3> can I somehow look at parent to know the form it belongs to?
[13:29:05] <synth_>  http://api.jquery.com/parents/ and http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[13:29:29] <synth_> @ xp_prg3 ^^
[13:29:29] <xp_prg3> ya parent is working
[13:29:34] <xp_prg3> thanks!
[13:29:38] <synth_> no prob!
[13:29:45] <xp_prg3> sometimes just asking a question can give the solution :>
[13:30:04] <synth_> it helps to verbalise your problem
[13:30:11] <Serdar> I say it, write down your question and you will see the solution :D
[13:30:19] <Uhkis> it's really common :)
[13:30:24] <Serdar> sometimes
[13:30:48] <Serdar> I write down a question, press enter. read it and say ... never mind!
[13:30:50] <xp_prg3> I have a dumb question, everyone is all about "responsive" web design, does jquery qualify as "repsonsive" web design?
[13:31:01] <BillCriswell> Who wants to look at something and let me know how badly I'm over complicating it?
[13:33:31] <synth_> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design
[13:33:44] <kristofers> Anyone had problems with jCarousel slider when fetching using ajax
[13:33:53] <BillCriswell> synth_: Don't know why I'm nervous about clicking that.
[13:33:55] <synth_> i would say bootstrap is an example of a responsive web framework
[13:34:00] <kristofers> i can't make it reload for some reason
[13:36:43] <jphase> xp_prg3: responsive web design is specifically design that uses css breakpoints to set style rules based on screen width
[13:37:23] <fuzzyhorns> i'm unable to set a submit button to disabled on submit
[13:38:17] <fuzzyhorns> if someone could help me understand why this doesnt work, id super appreciate it: https://gist.github.com/mooreniemi/2a4948507010e2fce67d

[13:56:16] <petey> What am I doing wrong here / what is this type of 'chaining' called? http://jsfiddle.net/AKhE2/1/
[13:56:31] <petey> I don't want to type out two (.content input) selectors so I want to do .focus/.blur under one selector
[13:57:47] <shoky> petey: you only type .content input  once
[13:57:52] <shoky> typed*
[13:57:58] <petey> Yeah isn't that possible?
[13:58:07] <shoky> it is
[13:58:09] <petey> Isn't it possible to 'chain' two different things together like that
[13:58:14] <shoky> it is
[13:58:16] <petey> I forgot what it's called and can't google it :(
[13:58:17] <shoky> oh
[13:58:25] <shoky> but no semi-colons in the middle of the chain..
[13:58:41] <shoky> that's a syntax error
[13:59:46] <petey> Is there something else I might be missing? I'm still getting an error, argh
[14:00:07] <shoky> the semi-colon
[14:00:10] <shoky> ;
[14:00:12] <BillCriswell> shoky: Care to take a look at something for me and let me know if I'm overcomplicating thing?
[14:00:31] <shoky> petey: on line 2
[14:00:43] <shoky> BillCriswell sure
[14:01:03] <BillCriswell> My main goal was to set the opacity of some elements to the amount of them visible on the screen visually. http://jsbin.com/avaTAzUb/3/edit
[14:01:08] <petey> Ohh I see what you're saying now. Thanks shoky
[14:01:24] <BillCriswell> It works, doesn't feel slow, but I feel like I may be complicating the math.
[14:01:42] <BillCriswell> Ew, set the opacity to the amount of the element visible on the screen. *
[14:02:14] <shoky> hmm why not do this with an overlay element, and some css gradient and opacity?
[14:02:59] <shoky> or is it important that it's the % of their visibility
[14:03:19] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha already did that, but I just did this as like a personal challenge.
[14:03:25] <BillCriswell> eg: http://jsbin.com/aVaSIJuB/2/edit
[14:03:37] <shoky> heh kay
[14:04:13] <BillCriswell> I think the straight CSS way is better by far, but for some reason I see knowing the math to figure out the amount of the element that's visible on the screen useful.
[14:05:02] <Serdar> I guess I use it the wrong way...
[14:05:27] <Serdar> but I am not sure how is the prober way
[14:06:32] <Serdar> the way it worked before was: I created this hidden form on the fly and called submit. now the form is set and I change the value and call submit
[14:06:47] <Serdar> but somehow the value is empty
[14:07:03] <Serdar> although console.log of value is set correctly
[14:10:23] <shoky> BillCriswell welp seems fine
[14:10:37] <BillCriswell> Really? I figured the math would surely suck.
[14:12:10] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/avaTAzUb/4/edit?js,output interesting effect with that box shadow.
[14:12:16] <BillCriswell> Ok I'm out of here. Thanks shoky!
[14:12:18] <shoky> well it works so it must not suck too much, and imo it doesn't suck at all ;p
[14:12:26] <shoky> seeya
[14:12:40] <BillCriswell> Haha thanks. Later!
[14:14:51] <Serdar> maybe I messed it up
[14:21:35] <chasep_work> I have a div, that has a link in it. If the user clicks anywhere in the div (besides the link) I want to hide the div. Any idea what I'm doing wrong: http://pastie.org/8564249 (currently, it hides the div even when you click the link)
[14:26:02] <youngnico> chasep_work: $(this) will give you e.currentTarget (rather than e.target, which is what you want)
[14:26:57] <youngnico> http://jsfiddle.net/SxaTE/ ^
[14:27:16] <chasep_work> thanks! I was getting confused with all the different targets
[14:27:24] <chasep_work> knew it had to be something there
[14:27:25] <youngnico> You bet :)
[14:27:56] <youngnico> Best way to find your way around is to throw a debugger in your handler and take a look at that magic "e" object. There's a ton of cool stuff in the event.
[14:30:24] <chasep_work> youngnico: yea, I'm dealing with a script that is inside na IE modal window... figured I'd check here before I went through loading it outside the modal and putting a debugger on it
[14:31:44] <Serdar> maybe val is the wrong way to setup the value properly
[14:35:47] <petey_> Is there anyway to check the "$(this)" of an item?
[14:36:23] <petey_> I have a situation that looks like this: http://jsbin.com/uRIqebe/1/
[14:39:15] <petey_> crap im an idiot, it works
[15:22:13] <SweetGuM> hey, can someone in here help me with superfish?
[16:09:33] <noobiewan> Hey guys, recently the short version to make a GET remote request $.get is not returning data to the function it was supposed to when the request is successfull, but if I write a long version $.ajax it works. It's intriguing me. Do you have any clue? Did something change? That's the code in question: http://jsfiddle.net/zSj8g/
[16:14:01] <noobiewan> my bad, JSON data wasn't valid
[16:18:31] <dekiss> what you use most position static relative absolute or floats or inline-block?
[17:02:42] <javalover> I have a jquery issue that i'm really confused how to solve....
[17:02:55] <javalover> basically, sometimes it recognizes the jquery being loaded & others it doesnt
[17:03:33] <javalover> it could have something to do with .load, as in my .load I have a document.ready script
[17:04:01] <shoky> what's .load and why do you have a document.ready script inside it
[17:05:05] <javalover> I use .load      in order to load a new page, like facebooks pictures
[17:05:23] <javalover> and I normally don't have it, but the script I required needed it
[17:05:32] <javalover> but I just noticed I had 2 of them so maybe this fixes it
[17:05:38] <shoky> it's best not to have scripts in pages you .load
[17:06:00] <jphase> or just .load the actual elements you want to load :\
[17:06:13] <javalover> this might have fixed it
[17:06:17] <shoky> ok
[17:06:24] <javalover> i had 2 document.onreadys
[17:06:31] <javalover> I think that's what was causing it
[17:06:42] <javalover> this time i had no error at all & it was fast i check console
[17:07:21] <javalover> yeah okay this is nice now
[17:07:23] <javalover> few
[17:07:38] <javalover> but to address what you said about it's bad practice
[17:07:47] <javalover> I like the organization of files this way
[17:07:56] <javalover> so perhaps I can find an alternative that still keeps the code organized
[17:08:41] <javalover> I have multiple formats for each page & I don't need them at the start it's based on users clicking an object to see it
[17:09:04] <javalover> so what would the best way be to organize it, so I do .load but I have the formatting already...
[17:11:25] <javalover> also some jquery plugins I won't need at the start, so I will need to load those as well...what is best practice for a site like this?
[17:15:07] <jphase> javalover: I'm sorry but the entirety of what you're saying doesn't have much context. I don't know what you're trying to accomplish exactly.
[17:26:30] <javalover> sorry had to make pasta
[17:26:43] <javalover> basically, how do you organize the code behind a site that has to load things dynamically
[17:27:11] <javalover> each page is it's own individual page, but it gets loaded into a frame on the site, much like how facebook loads pictures
[17:27:42] <javalover> now currently I use .load & keep the pages seperate but the feedback I got is that is bad practice...so what would you recommend instead?
[17:53:23] <sayd> anyone know how i can show ios smartbanners again? I cleared cookies and they still wont show up
[18:09:39] <Laire> Hello,
[18:14:17] <Laire> when i have more than one buttons like <input type="submit" id="button1"> in my form (with diffrent id's) and i intercept it with submit(function( event ) how i can get the id from the button wich was clicked?
[19:29:21] <dismist> can u somehow bind 2 selectors together (e.g. a searchbox and search button) so that any time one is hidden, the other goes with it?  or is the only way to put both selectors into an object variable and do a show and hide on that var?
[19:33:53] <BillCriswell> dismist: Are they in a common parent?
[19:33:59] <BillCriswell> Might be easiest to just do it on the parent.
[19:34:01] <dismist> body
[19:36:28] <dismist> actually good point though bill.... i'll just wrap what i can
[19:37:15] <dismist> my problem tends to be when hiding and showing (i should have a global function), i sometimes change my mind what should stay and go or what should trigger it so i end up with stupid bugs like that in the dev process that get uncovered way down the road

[20:14:02] <dekiss> anyone knows how to delete google charts x axis line?
[20:16:46] <amh345> I'm trying to setup my page so when i click on a link in the top navbar- the entire page scrolls to that section. aligning that section to the top of the window.   the problem I'm having is when the section is the very last on the page.  it doesn't have the ability to scroll to the top because there is no extra "room" at the bottom.  is there a solution for this sort of thing?
[20:23:53] <shoky> amh345: create the room ;p otherwise the user can't scroll there manually anyway so why would your navbar do it
[20:24:15] <amh345> hey shoky
[20:24:33] <amh345> you're saying just create a bunch of white space at the bottom?
[20:25:08] <shoky> hey
[20:25:29] <shoky> yeah, if you want it to appear there when the user scrolls down
[20:25:43] <shoky> then it's part of the content of the last section, so to speak
[20:26:06] <shoky> (conceptually, not necessarily in your html)
[20:26:09] <amh345> i may have to rethink this then. because on a large screen i'll need to add about 600px to the height. all white space :)
[20:26:19] <amh345> and that will seem to of gross, i think.
[20:26:27] <amh345> kind* / to
[20:26:35] <shoky> does it really need to go to the top?
[20:27:24] <amh345> it doesn't really. no.  i tried middle of the page. but even that doesn't work. hah.
[20:27:31] <amh345> due to the height
[20:27:56] <amh345> when i first tried it- i was on my 13 inch screen. and it was flawless.  then i moved to my 27 inch screen and discovered the problem :/
[20:30:02] <shoky> btw the whitespace would best be added via padding
[20:30:18] <shoky> don't need an extra element necessarily
[20:30:33] <shoky> so just space, not whitespace ;p
[20:34:06] <gnarf> djbutterchicken: thanks for the report
[20:34:27] <gnarf> djbutterchicken: got that fixed
[20:50:33] <djbutterchicken> working, cheers gnarf :)
[20:54:07] <abjorn> .
[21:32:10] <jphase> erma gerd, so much recursion.... so little time
[22:10:47] <RonWhoCares> how do I create a comment in jQuery?  I am wanting to comment out a section of code, not just a single line
[22:11:12] <jphase> start with /*
[22:11:14] <jphase> lines here
[22:11:17] <jphase> */
[22:11:19] <grafi>  /*    */
[22:11:21] <grafi> :P
[22:11:57] <RonWhoCares> thank you
[22:12:23] * jphase and grafi bow
[22:14:07] <andrew_r> I am finding out that most plugins are not really made for single page applications...
[22:14:24] <snickle> how come?
[22:14:33] <snickle> or how so
[22:14:34] <andrew_r> "memory leaks"
[22:14:37] <snickle> oh
[22:15:22] <andrew_r> the ones I am using all use variables in closure scope
[22:15:25] <jphase> bad programming :\
[22:15:59] <andrew_r> which is usually fine, but when I remove a "page" all these detached dom trees are still in memory because the plugin knows about still
[22:16:56] <snickle> can you set up a tree model to attach your plugin to then set to null when you change pages?
[22:17:48] <snickle> or if it's just dom elements then attach them to something like an invisible div rather than keeping them floating around
[22:19:04] <andrew_r> the dom elements are removed completely from the page, they get stuck in memory because the plugin still references them
[22:19:32] <andrew_r> what do you mean by tree model?
[22:21:57] <snickle> just off the top of my head like app = { pageonescripts: { memoryleakyscript: function(){...}}}
[22:22:02] <snickle> then when you switch pages
[22:22:11] <snickle> app.pageonescripts.memoryleakscript = null
[22:23:10] <andrew_r> can I make a copy of something like $().jqgrid and then set it to null when it's removed?
[22:23:32] <andrew_r> maybe var mygrid = $.fn.jqGrid; then  myGrid = null; later?
[22:24:02] <snickle> do you have the source code for jqGrid hand?
[22:24:03] <snickle> handy*
[22:24:26] <snickle> i'd imagine so but if it's handling resources in a crappy way then maybe not
[22:24:50] <andrew_r> yes I have the jqGrid source
[22:25:42] <andrew_r> it's too big to rewrite to not use any variables in closure scope though
[22:26:04] <andrew_r> I'll have to try the idea of copying $.fn.jqGrid and see if that works
[22:42:02] <bradbrad> Hi guys, please please help me figure out why if I put my mouse over the slider section (its the world) I suddenly cant use the scroll function on my mouse?? been racking my brain for hours trying to figure it out! http://www.vertexcentral.co.za/
[22:45:41] <andrew_r> bradbrad: it still works if you move your mouse way to the left or the right
[22:46:44] <andrew_r> if you mouse over the menu, then right click where you can't scroll and inspect the element, you'll find that there is a .smart-slide-layer div in the way
[22:47:58] <andrew_r> is that part of the menu?
[22:49:50] <andrew_r> oh, I see... it has nothing to do with the menu, it never scrolls if you are over that center area on the top
[22:51:40] <grafi> bradbrad set pointer-events: none on the div
[22:53:48] <bradbrad> grafi thanks, but then the links in the slider dont work :( (look at the speech bubbles)
[23:05:11] <grafi> bradbrad then set pointer-events: auto for those
[23:05:33] <grafi> that should work, although its curios that the scroll is somehow disabled at all ...
[23:08:15] <bradbrad> grafi thanks!
[23:16:31] <lite_> so. Im trying to dynamically append an element but would like to have it slide in rather than just 'appear'. what am I doing wrong here? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/24ecfd36458a400e2161
[23:16:46] <lite_> Where $elem is the element I wish to append to
[23:30:03] <andrew_r> lite_: slideDown is a function, you have to have the ()
[23:30:11] <andrew_r> also, appendTo is camel case
[23:33:45] <lite_> andrew_r: sorry. copy paste fuckup
[23:33:48] <lite_> yeah im doing that.
[23:33:50] <lite_> nothing happens
[23:36:18] <andrew_r> what is <login-directive> ?
[23:36:39] <andrew_r> try it with a regular div?
[23:37:12] <lite_> andrew_r: its from AngularJS. basically a custom dom element
[23:37:20] <lite_> or well. a template
[23:37:45] <lite_> (it's just a regular div with stuff nested in it)
[23:41:20] <andrew_r> try $(pinTemplate).hide().appendTo($elem).slideDown();
[23:58:29] <lite_> andrew_r: it would appear that .show('slow') actually fades it in slowly. but slideDown does nothing :/
[23:58:34] <lite_> or well. it just appears.
[23:59:27] <andrew_r> did you try hiding it first?
[23:59:43] <andrew_r> $(pinTemplate).hide().appendTo($elem).slideDown();
