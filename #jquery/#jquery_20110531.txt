[00:00:14] <coldhead> can anyone recommend any good xxx live cam sites?
[00:00:18] <dejx> hahaha
[00:01:28] <innociv> what's a simple way to way to turn $(el).css('color') which returns rgb(#,#,#) to an rgba?
[00:02:18] <innociv> I want to reset the color and opacity of an element as an rgba.
[00:03:29] <coldhead> innociv: see if this has what you need http://gnarf.net/2011/05/14/messing-with-jquery-color/
[00:03:45] <mahen23> hello world
[00:03:54] <coldhead> hallo mahen23
[00:04:13] <mahen23> anyone can suggest me a jquery image slider, that onclick opens the current image in lightbox?
[00:07:30] <mahen23> anyone?
[00:07:33] <Edler2> yea ?
[00:07:40] <mahen23> anyone can suggest me a jquery image slider, that onclick opens the current image in lightbox?
[00:07:44] <coldhead> mahen23: ecosanity.org
[00:07:59] <coldhead> the one that site uses it the first thing that comes to mind lately
[00:08:05] <coldhead> i think that's just jquery cycle
[00:09:12] <Taggnostr> is there a way to jump to an anchor with jquery?
[00:09:47] <coldhead> ?g jquery localscroll plugin @ Taggnostr
[00:09:48] <bot-t> Taggnostr, LocalScroll | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/LocalScroll
[00:10:03] <Edler2> coldhead: where can i learn to use bot-t ?
[00:10:22] <coldhead> or if you are boring location.href.hash = 'something'
[00:10:39] <Taggnostr> that sounds better
[00:10:39] <Edler> ?
[00:10:46] <coldhead> Edler: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[00:11:00] <Edler> cool so this is an official channel!
[00:11:02] <jomofcw> Morning :)
[00:11:03] <Edler> lol
[00:11:14] <coldhead> hella official
[00:11:19] <Taggnostr> coldhead, do you know if location.href.hash works cross browser?
[00:11:29] <coldhead> it oughta!
[00:11:36] <Taggnostr> nice
[00:11:40] <Edler> ?g lightbox
[00:11:41] <bot-t> Edler, Lightbox 2 - http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/
[00:12:09] <coldhead> beg pardon, Taggnostr, it should be location.hash

[00:12:12] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:12:12] <coldhead> no href
[00:12:23] <Taggnostr> ok
[00:12:27] <coldhead> Edler: try /query bot-t
[00:12:33] <coldhead> :_
[00:12:39] <coldhead> :)*
[00:12:59] <Edler> ?eval print('I am an awesome bot!');
[00:13:00] <bot-t> Edler: "I am an awesome bot!"
[00:13:06] <Edler> i know that bot-t
[00:13:07] <Taggnostr> what I want to do is to jump to the last message of a list when the user hits the end key, and then jump to the end of the page when he hits it again
[00:14:11] <ustim> ? load
[00:14:11] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[00:14:42] <coldhead> that's pretty doable, Taggnostr
[00:14:54] <coldhead> have a go up at jsfiddle and we can help you tune it
[00:14:58] <coldhead> ?p @ Taggnostr
[00:14:58] <bot-t> Taggnostr, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[00:15:53] <Taggnostr> now I'm trying locally to see if I can get it working, if I have problems I'll post it on jsfiddle :)
[00:17:21] <dtach> can anyone see why my setTimeout is failing http://jsfiddle.net/XFbSU/1/
[00:17:54] <dtach> 5000 = 500 btw
[00:18:17] <dtach> now it just runs the function instantly
[00:18:25] <dtach> instead of after a certain time
[00:18:52] <coldhead> dtach: http://jsfiddle.net/XFbSU/2/
[00:18:55] <Floss> dtach: any error msgs?
[00:19:04] <dtach> sadly no
[00:19:06] <coldhead> PlaceMarker(address) DOES run instantly
[00:19:40] <coldhead> PlaceMarker would return a reference to the function you'd like to have run
[00:19:59] <coldhead> but if you want to pass address to iit you need to use an anonymous function
[00:20:12] <coldhead> capiche?
[00:20:43] <dtach> roger that
[00:20:44] <dtach> thanks
[00:20:55] <coldhead> a pleasure!
[00:21:38] <dtach> hehe
[00:23:22] <mahen23> hey guys, how do i pass a string in a function?
[00:23:30] <Edler> what do you mean ?
[00:23:31] <Edler> pass it to what
[00:23:31] <mahen23> function functionname (string) ?
[00:23:36] <Edler> yeah
[00:23:37] <Edler> ...
[00:23:47] <mahen23> or function functionname (string var) ?
[00:23:51] <Edler> no no
[00:23:55] <Edler> you don't type string
[00:23:59] <Edler> javascript is loosely type
[00:24:02] <Edler> just the name of the variable
[00:24:10] <coldhead> and you don't type var because it's a reserved word
[00:24:18] <coldhead> :)
[00:24:23] <mahen23> i do not get it
[00:24:33] <mahen23> so i type functionname (strinf) ?
[00:24:37] <Edler> yup
[00:24:47] <Edler> that is if you're calling the function
[00:24:54] <coldhead> ?eval function foo(lol) {alert(lol);} foo('a string');
[00:24:55] <bot-t> coldhead: "a string"
[00:25:01] <mahen23> how do i declare the function ?
[00:25:12] <coldhead> ?eval function foo(lol) {alert(lol);} foo(10000);
[00:25:13] <bot-t> coldhead: 10000
[00:25:13] <Edler> function functionname (mystring)
[00:25:18] <mahen23> ok ok i got it
[00:25:24] <Edler> great
[00:25:48] <innociv> Hm.. if an element has color:transparent; and you do .css('color') you get rgba('0, 0, 0, 0') but I'm strongly guessing it returns something else in IE that has no RGBA support.
[00:26:02] <coldhead> ?eval function foo(lol) {if (typeof lol != 'string') alert("what the fuck?");} foo(10000);
[00:26:03] <bot-t> coldhead: "what the fuck?"
[00:26:05] <innociv> which is troublesome if you want to check if a color is transparent
[00:26:39] <coldhead> innociv: the best bet is to use gnarf's color plugin, and if it still doesn't work it probably can't be done
[00:26:41] <Cork> innociv: as far as i know css returns translarent if thats what you've set
[00:26:43] <coldhead> he did a lot of work on that
[00:26:55] <Cork> s/know/remember/
[00:27:17] <Cork> *transparent
[00:27:21] <innociv> cork, not in chrome at least it doesn't
[00:27:28] <innociv> thanks, coldhead.
[00:29:52] <mahen23> it seems like i cannot place functions inside $(document).ready(function() {
[00:30:01] <mahen23> Y U NO like functions?
[00:30:11] <Edler> mahen23: what's the problem ?
[00:30:38] <Cork> innociv: $(document.body).css('color')
[00:30:38] <Cork> "transparent"
[00:30:39] <mahen23> can i declare a function inside the document ready ?
[00:30:47] <innociv> in chrome? not for me
[00:30:56] <Cork> innociv: thats from firefox
[00:31:05] <innociv> $(el).css({color:'transparent'}).css('color') returns an rgba
[00:31:06] <Edler> mahen23: why couldn't you ?
[00:31:10] <Cork> one sec and i'll test ie
[00:31:26] <coldhead> you can, mahen23 , but they will only be accessible to other code within the .ready()
[00:31:27] <innociv> I guess I can just put an || though
[00:32:15] <innociv> I can't pass args like window.setTimeout(function(arg1,arg2), 1000); can't I?
[00:32:28] <Cork> no
[00:32:44] <Cork> you need to wrap in an anonymus function
[00:33:43] <mahen23> !attr
[00:33:53] <Edler> ? attr @ mahen23
[00:33:53] <bot-t> mahen23, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[00:34:02] <mahen23> thanks Edler
[00:34:15] <coldhead> you are a scholar and a gentleman/woman, Edler
[00:34:28] <Whirl3d> Anybody know off hand why you would get this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultView' of undefined
[00:34:58] <coldhead> ?eval doesNotExist.defaultView
[00:34:59] <bot-t> coldhead: ReferenceError: doesNotExist is not defined
[00:35:25] <coldhead> ?eval doesNotExist = undefined; doesNotExist.defaultView
[00:35:25] <bot-t> coldhead: TypeError: doesNotExist is undefined
[00:35:37] <coldhead> oh bite me
[00:35:40] <Whirl3d> is 'defaultView' something internal to jquery?
[00:36:00] <coldhead> no, you should see the line number in the stack trace with the error message, Whirl3d
[00:36:26] <Cork> innociv: now thats interesting
[00:36:46] <Cork> innociv: ie8 returns undefined for color: transparent;
[00:36:53] <innociv> Wow.  rofl.
[00:37:15] <Whirl3d> Yeah, the last line of code that was mine was about five lines previous and there wasn't even a ref or variable in the line. I'll keep digging, just thought it might look familiar to someone.. thx
[00:38:42] <Cork> innociv: ah, no its my hacked in alert that fails to find the body in ie for some strange reason
[00:38:47] <coldhead> ?eval doesNotExist = ""; doesNotExist.defaultView
[00:38:48] <bot-t> coldhead: undefined
[00:39:16] * Cork moves it to a button instead
[00:40:24] <Cork> innociv: there much better...
[00:40:26] <Cork> sort of...
[00:40:33] <Cork> innociv: it returns "auto" >_<'
[00:40:40] <innociv> Heh
[00:41:12] <xrmx> hi there, i have a grid of boxes and for each box i want to catch the hover and display a caption, unfortunately when i move the mouse over some of them the cpu starts to go up, i've tried to not queue events but doesn't solve the issue, this is the code, any hint?  http://pastebin.com/K5qgP7Sh
[00:41:44] <coldhead> Cork: you should think of a way to normalise that and submit a pull request to gnarf's colour plugin if it doesn't handle it already
[00:41:55] <coldhead> mostly so i don't have to do it
[00:41:59] <mahen23> apparently, lightbox does not work with easyslider plugin
[00:42:00] <Cork> coldhead: i would expect it does
[00:42:08] <mahen23> so i had to create my own
[00:42:13] <mahen23> live rocks
[00:42:14] <Cork> coldhead: this was mostly just out of curiosity
[00:42:18] <coldhead> good work, mahen23!
[00:42:28] <coldhead> Cork: you are curious about awful things :)
[00:42:34] <Cork> LOL
[00:43:11] <innociv> how do I make an object readable in console?  Sting() on it makes it [object Object]
[00:43:28] <Cork> innociv: just console(object)
[00:43:38] <Cork> should get you a clickable object tree
[00:43:46] <Cork> opps
[00:43:50] <Cork> console.log(object)
[00:43:55] <innociv> It does but...
[00:44:01] <innociv> not giving me what I expect to see
[00:44:15] <coldhead> console.dir(object) can be more helpful
[00:44:17] <Cork> you could try console.log(JSON.strinigy(object))
[00:44:29] <innociv> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/754607/can-jquery-get-all-css-styles-associated-with-an-element this guys css() function
[00:44:55] <innociv> maybe his function just doesn't work..
[00:45:03] <coldhead> gross
[00:46:12] <Zeddy> anyone know why im getting the following error in chrome console: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'delegate'
[00:46:14] <innociv> yeah that's giving me "{}"
[00:46:28] <Zeddy> this happends when i include jqueryui from google in my page
[00:46:37] <Zeddy> i'm not even trying to do anything with jqueryui :P
[00:46:53] <Edler> including stuff from google has always caused me problems
[00:47:18] <coldhead> Zeddy: you might be including the wrong version of jQuery
[00:47:30] <coldhead> UI is tightly coupled to particular jQ versions
[00:47:51] <Zeddy> hmm
[00:47:52] <Zeddy> jquery-1.4.1.min
[00:47:58] <coldhead> that's old
[00:48:03] <Zeddy> jqueryui/1.8.13/jquery-ui.min.js
[00:48:04] <coldhead> you'll need an old UI
[00:48:06] <Zeddy> ok :D
[00:48:11] <coldhead> or a newer jQ
[00:48:12] <Zeddy> ill refresh the jquery then
[00:48:20] <coldhead> good idea :)
[00:48:47] <Zeddy> okay, that did the trick
[00:48:55] <Zeddy> i didn't even realise jQuery is at version 1.6 allready
[00:49:10] <Zeddy> last time i was working on a web page i was still using 1.4 ^_^
[00:49:27] <xrmx> is it possible to enqueue animations for different objects in the same queue?
[00:55:04] <Taggnostr> if I use $(document).keydown() to detect if the end key is pressed, it will detect it even when it's pressed in forms. Is there a way to avoid that?
[00:55:12] <CalvinMcGee> I'm having some probs with jQuery UI's autocomplete. The result ul is display:hidden and can't figure out why
[00:55:48] <Taggnostr> I want to detect it only in the cases where the browser would go at the end of the page, rather than e.g. the end of the line in a textarea/input
[00:56:32] <JeanM> Has anyone else ever had problems with position() or offset() returning the wrong (different) values in webkit compared to firefox/ie?
[00:56:57] <JeanM> firefox returns 400 (correct), webkit returns 142 (incorrect)...?
[00:57:05] <innociv> I have a setTimeout in mousemove() but really I want the timer to start once the mouse stops moving moving, how can I do that?
[00:57:09] <juha____> firefox sucks
[01:00:40] <innociv> Nevermind i think i have something
[01:01:06] <coldhead> innociv: if you restart the timer on every mousemove it won't really start until the mouse stops moving
[01:01:45] <anthony_dev> when I created datepicker, I want to change its animation. whats wring with this?  : $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker( "option", "showAnim", "fold" );
[01:02:29] <coldhead> anthony_dev: are you sure it's expecting strings?
[01:02:49] <coldhead> "option", "showAnim", fold) maybe?
[01:02:54] * coldhead guesses
[01:04:31] <Taggnostr> here's a fiddle for you about the keydown problem: http://jsfiddle.net/hrwSL/2/
[01:05:06] <Taggnostr> (you have to click on the output square to make the 'end' key work)
[01:06:03] <anthony_dev> coldhead: hmm then I dont know why its still doesnt work. oh. maybe its bcz this control appears at end of page and bottom side is hidden (offscreen) ?
[01:06:30] <anthony_dev> its just shows in a default way
[01:06:51] <fRAiLtY-> If I use this: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-countdown/ <-- can I tell it to restart on timerEnd and how?
[01:11:23] <codemagician> how do I get a value from an HTML form and plug in into the initial settings of a jstree setup?
[01:13:57] <anthony_dev> i got same problem T_T http://forum.jquery.com/topic/datepicker-on-top-in-small-screen
[01:18:37] <jayflux> Does anybody here use the Flot plugin
[01:19:00] <JeanM> about my issues with position() giving different results in webkit/firefox. It seems webkit is too fast for its own good. It somehow gets the position of an element before it's properly positioned (when using document.ready), when adding a setTimeout of approx 100ms it returns the correct value. Anyone ever encountered this?
[01:20:23] <innociv> I'm missing something.. why doesn't .animate({textShadow:'#fff 0 0 5px'}, 1000) do anything at all?
[01:22:07] <innociv> oh screw it i'll use transition property
[01:22:32] <Zeddy> when adding html5 contenteditable="true" to a ul, why can't i change the text of the li elements (i have applied jqueryui sortable to the li)
[01:33:37] <innociv> if i have $('.class:eq(1)') how do I see what the index is of that element within the classes is?
[01:38:40] <jayflux> by using the .index() method innociv
[01:38:48] <jayflux> ?index @ innociv
[01:38:48] <bot-t> innociv, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[01:38:58] <innociv> I already tried that, doesn't do what I was asking
[01:39:33] <innociv> that will work if you're selecting one li in a ul for example
[01:39:44] <innociv> but not if you're selecting one element from many in a class
[01:39:47] <innociv> it goes by siblings
[01:39:58] <innociv> .class aren't nessisarily siblings
[01:40:09] <jayflux> you're best of using the .each() method then
[01:40:19] <jayflux> that will put all your matches into an array
[01:40:29] <jayflux> ?.each @ innociv
[01:40:30] <bot-t> innociv, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[01:41:08] <innociv> if I each all the classes how can I see the index of the one that matches?
[01:44:37] <jayflux> hmm
[01:48:29] <jayflux> innociv:  surely if you eq(0) then its going to be the first matched element in that class
[01:48:56] <innociv> try it yourself.. $('.class:eq(1)').eq()
[01:49:54] <jayflux> that won't work
[01:50:07] <jayflux> you're getting the index twice there, therefore you're getting the index of the index
[01:50:14] <jayflux> which will just give you 0
[01:50:30] <innociv> i need to get the index of a passed element because I have an array with values relevant to elements by their position in the class
[01:59:04] <Taggnostr> coldhead, this is how I solved it: http://jsfiddle.net/hrwSL/3/
[01:59:06] <kostodo> Is it possible to insert some html i.e. - <p class="foo">bar</p> inside if  #div
[01:59:22] <kostodo> inside of a #div
[02:01:02] <Taggnostr> try $('#div').append($('<p class="foo">bar</p>'))
[02:01:59] <kostodo> Taggnostr: let me try that
[02:02:49] <CalvinMcGee> I'm having some probs with jQuery UI's autocomplete. The result ul is display:hidden and can't figure out why
[02:03:41] <clorith> qhen using .datepicker on an element that is auto-populated on page load, how can I stop the datepicker form triggering when the page is loaded?
[02:03:48] <kostodo> Taggnostr: nah not working
[02:04:28] <Taggnostr> kostodo, paste your code on jsfiddle
[02:07:49] <Rost> Hmm.... my code isnt working in Firefox but it is in chrome and IE
[02:09:10] <Rost> This is my code http://jsfiddle.net/yEV8u/2/
[02:09:42] <Rost> Btw i know i did you to much variables i was testing something :P
[02:14:11] <Rost> A bit update http://jsfiddle.net/yEV8u/3/ of the code
[02:15:45] <Rost> My Firefox does weird when i go to jsfiddle :S
[02:16:09] <Taggnostr> Rost, don't you need to set the css 'position' of the tooltip to absolute in order to use top?
[02:16:29] <Rost> It is in the css sheet
[02:18:04] <AlexC_> g'morning
[02:18:35] <AlexC_> with jQuery is it possible to get and set the scroll position of an element? Lets say I have a div { height: 300px; width: 300px; overflow-y: scroll } for example
[02:18:46] <Rost> but I think its my firefox for some reason because I cant even see JSfiddle :S
[02:20:18] <AlexC_> oh win, scrollTop() ... nevermind
[02:21:42] <Rost> http://twitpic.com/54yt1o this isnt how Firefox is supposed to see jsfiddle right?
[02:26:34] <jayflux> no
[02:26:55] <jayflux> you have any 3rd party extensions running
[02:27:04] <Rost> nope fresh install
[02:27:06] <jayflux> although it was down yesterday so it may be having some issues
[02:27:17] <Rost> only firebug
[02:27:58] <queden> Hi folks! How can I change the style of my active sortable element for the time it is being dragged? The following is my start, but it does not work for some reasons: $( "#sortable" ).sortable({ sort: function(event, ui) { $(this).css("color","red"); } stop: function(event, ui) { $(this).css("color","black"); } });
[02:28:33] <Peeter> Rost: Works fine for me on FF4
[02:28:47] <Rost> My code or Jsfiddle?
[02:29:00] <Peeter> jsfiddle layout
[02:29:05] <jayflux> works for me to
[02:29:09] <jayflux> what versions of firefox you using?
[02:29:13] <jayflux> 1.0 ?
[02:29:13] <Rost> wierd 4.0.1
[02:29:26] <jayflux> windows im guessing
[02:29:29] <Rost> yes
[02:29:43] <Peeter> Same here
[02:30:05] <jayflux> Rost:  it must be something your end
[02:30:14] <Rost> Ye I think
[02:30:28] <Rost> because i cant see demos on Jquery.com too...
[02:30:41] <Peeter> js disabled?
[02:31:06] <Rost> naaah that would be really stupid of me ? let me check :P
[02:31:23] <Rost>  /facepalm
[02:31:46] <Peeter> :D
[02:33:02] <phrearch> hi
[02:33:20] <phrearch> does anyone know if a jquery ui accordion can be programmatically ordered to collapse all?
[02:33:20] <Alexer> Peeter, how did you even think of that? :D
[02:34:41] <Peeter> Alexer: Two completly different sites that both use javascript extensively & neither work.
[02:35:36] <Alexer> ah, damn, true!
[02:46:22] <barrychapman> how do i tell if an attr is defined with jquery?
[02:47:14] <KingDosser> $(#someelement).attr('id');
[02:47:19] <KingDosser> #barrychapman
[02:47:31] <barrychapman> var wid = $(this).attr("wid");
[02:47:43] <KingDosser> What is wid?
[02:47:53] <barrychapman> an attribute i am setting
[02:48:01] <KingDosser> so yes
[02:48:26] <barrychapman> except i get this error: $(this).attr("wid") is undefined
[02:48:26] <KingDosser> That should work depending on the surrounding code though
[02:48:41] <KingDosser> Replace this with the class or the id of the element
[02:50:18] <barrychapman> ok
[02:50:27] <KingDosser> My question: Is there some sort of problem with images being jquery ui droppables ?
[02:50:55] <KingDosser> Because when I try drop elements on an img, nothing happens but if i change the droppable to another element, it works
[02:56:23] <Wipp> I have an array, I need to append data to one element inside that array, how do I use jquery for that? I have tried jQuery.arr["key"].append("something"); but that ofcourse doesn't work
[02:58:42] <kapowaz> .append isn't for that
[02:58:49] <kapowaz> .append is a DOM manipulation method
[02:59:08] <kapowaz> what type is that element of the array? a string?
[02:59:28] <Wipp> kapowaz: yes, its string
[02:59:46] <KingDosser> kapowaz Do you know if there is a bit of incompatibility with imgs being jquery droppables
[03:00:18] <kapowaz> Wipp: you extended the jQuery object with an array called arr ?
[03:00:53] <kapowaz> either way, if it's just a string you'd do it the same way you'd concatenate any JS string
[03:01:05] <kapowaz> jQuery.arr["key"] += "something";
[03:01:10] <coldhead> KingDosser: there should not be, they should not care what the html you are using is
[03:01:13] <kapowaz> KingDosser: no idea
[03:01:26] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/3eHqP/ <-- This counts down to a year, I borrowed the function from a script, how can I change this so it only counts down to 10am daily, then restarts?
[03:01:28] <coldhead> MAYBE there is a problem if the browser has a native image drag thingy
[03:01:31] <KingDosser> Because, its not working when I use an img
[03:01:45] <KingDosser> im going to try setting the img as a background image
[03:02:29] <jrockjiggz> fRAiLtY-: are you going to return it when you are finished?
[03:02:56] <fRAiLtY-> No, I just want it to start again, it's a deadline to order by 10am, so once 10am passes it starts again
[03:03:34] <mrmagoo1982> hi peeps
[03:05:05] <mrmagoo1982> i want to clone an element and its contents and stick it after the cloned element when a button after the div is clicked.... so <div>stuff</div><a href="#" id="clone">clone</a> becomes <div>stuff</div><div>stuff</div> <a href="#" id="clone">clone</a>
[03:05:13] <mrmagoo1982> $(this).previous('div').clone();
[03:05:23] <mrmagoo1982> this is what i've got so far
[03:05:37] <mrmagoo1982> not sure how to stick the clone after the div
[03:05:39] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: heh, I recognize this
[03:05:52] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: that script thinks 1 minute has 100 seconds on IE, just saying...
[03:07:10] <fRAiLtY-> Hi seutje Oh dear, I have a countdown script that works already but this one has flippy images, if I could integrate those into my existing counter that would be great, but not sure how :/
[03:07:59] <EugenA> i'm getting alert: "An HTTP error 500 occurred. ... "
[03:08:30] <EugenA> does it mean unallowed output somewhere in php code?
[03:08:32] <jayflux> Any of you guys used or using Flot ??
[03:08:53] <seutje> iono, use a class and set the background-position on that class and sprinkly with some css transitions
[03:09:22] <fRAiLtY-> iono ?
[03:09:27] <EugenA> how can i debug this? ajax is ok, for sure
[03:09:44] <raccoon_> EugenA: error 500 means that something went wrong while executing the request on the server... could be anything from httpd config file error, php module problems or parse error in php script(s). for example.
[03:09:54] <raccoon_> EugenA: check httpd logs
[03:10:35] <EugenA> raccoon_: the problem is i don't getting any errors in apache log
[03:10:54] <ravenzz> that should be an htaccess error too
[03:11:19] <raccoon_> EugenA: do you have any php error logs?
[03:12:51] <EugenA> raccoon_: i have error log for web server and it is clean
[03:13:05] <EugenA> raccoon_: it is not clean, but no new errors
[03:13:39] <raccoon_> EugenA: ok, then it might be the php script you are calling that is throwing an http 500 code because something went wrong in it
[03:13:40] <EugenA> it is difficult to find the problem, i have many php files
[03:14:30] <EugenA> if it would be php, then i would get an error in error.log
[03:14:30] <KingDosser> I have a div thats bg img is changed on hover. Is there any way I can load that second image so it doesnt glitch out?
[03:15:14] <EugenA> so, something bother jquery to run
[03:15:41] <matt1982> Hey I have a button that when clicked issues a $.get() however it is possible to click it twice which will send the request again. What is the best way to disable? Should I hide the button when clicked redisplaying it on return result or is there a better way?
[03:16:16] <EugenA> i don't think it is php error.. could it be echo / print from any php function?
[03:16:28] <KingDosser> Anyone?
[03:16:39] <queden> Hi folks! How can I change the style of my active sortable element for the time it is being dragged? The following is my start, but it does not work for some reasons: $( "#sortable" ).sortable({ sort: function(event, ui) { $(this).css("color","red"); } stop: function(event, ui) { $(this).css("color","black"); } });
[03:16:44] <RaceCondition> is jQuery Mobile capable of using CSS3 for animations?
[03:16:59] <EugenA> can some output from php make jquery not working?
[03:19:48] <rudra1> can somebody help me with auto refrshing a particular div using jquery?
[03:22:22] <KingDosser> What do you need to do rudra1 ?

[03:29:16] <Tumulte> Hi y'all
[03:29:16] <rudra1> you want me to paste the code and show u?
[03:29:53] <dytrivedi> by any chance, are you from Rudra Software?
[03:29:56] <dytrivedi> rudra1?
[03:30:00] <rudra1> no no
[03:30:03] <rudra1> my name is rudra
[03:30:06] <dytrivedi> ahh haw ok

[03:30:31] <dytrivedi> no bot-t!!!!
[03:30:33] <dytrivedi> halp
[03:30:37] <dytrivedi> .seen bot-t
[03:30:37] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 33 minutes and 51 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[03:31:14] <Desperadis> anyone?
[03:31:40] <Tumulte> Do you know the name of the (or a) plugin that helps to make chained animations. I can't found it again
[03:32:16] <rudra1> http://paste.ubuntu.com/615268/
[03:33:09] <dytrivedi> rudra1: ok bhale hu jara jai lau mota
[03:33:31] <rudra1> which language is that?
[03:33:49] <rudra1>  dytrivedi:  ?
[03:33:56] <dytrivedi> ohh it's Hindi
[03:34:11] <dytrivedi> btw that coad looks just fine
[03:34:16] <dytrivedi> there's some other issue somewhere
[03:35:05] <rudra1> dytrivedi: it just needs refresh for the status
[03:35:31] <dytrivedi> yeah, but javascript looks fine
[03:35:39] <dytrivedi> which means that the issue is somewhere else
[03:36:12] <rudra1> ok
[03:36:24] <rudra1> what else could be the possibilities?
[03:37:23] <Desperadis2> sorry got d/c
[03:37:29] <Desperadis2> has any1 seen my jsfiddle?
[03:38:31] <Altreus> in UI Sortable, the over event seems to fire as often as the mouse moves an iota, rather than the implied once
[03:38:40] <beiter> lo
[03:38:51] <dytrivedi> that can't be said, without going through other stuff, rudra1
[03:39:03] <rudra1> ok
[03:39:11] <Altreus> I was hoping to hook into an event that fires when the length of the Sortable increases, i.e. a new element is created in it by means of a draggable
[03:39:18] <Desperadis2> http://jsfiddle.net/8wvNv/1/ <- i dont need to make clean code, i want it to work and thats it
[03:39:20] <dytrivedi> my guess is that the plugin is not working correctly
[03:39:58] <dytrivedi> I would've helped you Desperadis2, but jsfiddle is broken here
[03:40:10] <Desperadis2> aw ;(
[03:43:52] <ravenzz> Desperadis2 http://jsfiddle.net/LJyKr/
[03:44:03] <khmer> Desperadis2: http://jsfiddle.net/8wvNv/2/
[03:44:17] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/nQPJk/1/ <-- How do I make this script countdown to 10am daily?
[03:44:23] <khmer> lol@ravenzz
[03:44:54] <ravenzz> perchè usare onclick, quando c'è jquery
[03:45:09] <jayflux> Altreus:  you ever used flot?
[03:46:14] <Desperadis2> thanks khmer
[03:46:44] <Desperadis2> I wonder why it was not working
[03:47:28] <rudra1> dytrivedi:  can we have a auto refresh for particular div?
[03:47:46] <Altreus> jayflux: flot?
[03:47:48] <Altreus> no
[03:48:05] <dytrivedi> wat
[03:48:10] <Desperadis2> you can use ajax
[03:49:13] <rudra1> can you tell me how?
[03:49:16] <khmer> Desperadis2: in the console, you might see that there was no "gne" variable in the scope in which the DOM 0 scripts were being run. i think it's probably some weird consequence of jsfiddle
[03:49:44] <khmer> Desperadis2: you can sort of do it your way by changing it from a function declaration to a function expression on a window property
[03:50:18] <ravenzz> Desperadis2 inoltre è una cazzata usare classi con numeri progressivi, usa id

[03:53:17] <sodapop>  how do i override the font- properties for all ui components tabs,accordions etc?
[03:54:16] <kostodo> How would I make a conditional statement that says: if there is more than 1 div.field-item in div.fied-items then do xxx
[03:54:41] <ravenzz> sodapop did you tried #container * { font-size:13px !important }
[03:54:42] <ravenzz> ?
[03:55:02] <sodapop> no i just have it set for body
[03:55:43] <ravenzz> kostodo if ($(div.fied-items div.field-item).length > 1)
[03:55:50] <KingDosser> Whats wrong with this: 						$("#trash").animate({width: "100px", height: "100px", background-size:"100px 100px"},1500);
[03:55:51] <ravenzz> oh i miss the quotes
[03:55:59] <ravenzz> kostodo if ($("div.fied-items div.field-item").length > 1)
[03:56:00] <sodapop> can it be lke * { ....
[03:56:16] <kostodo> ravenzz: lemme try that mate
[03:56:37] <Desperadis2> ok khmer thanks :)
[03:56:53] <ravenzz> sodapop it can be whatever you want, i suppose that !important could do the "magic"
[03:57:00] <sodapop> ok
[03:57:10] <Desperadis2> ravenzz non mi interessa che sia pulito e bello il codice, basta che funzioni
[03:57:21] <ravenzz> vabbe mentre ci sei però.. ;)
[03:58:02] <dytrivedi> I do not care that the code is clean and beautiful, just that it works
[03:58:27] <kostodo> ravenzz: so if ($("div.fied-items div.field-item").length > 1) { $.... }; ?
[03:58:52] <ravenzz> yes if you need "more than one" div.field-item
[03:59:07] <kostodo> not working tho
[03:59:13] <kostodo> one sec
[03:59:14] <ravenzz> if ($("div.fied-items div.field-item").length) if you need at least one
[03:59:41] <KingDosser> Anyone know whats wrong with this: $("#trash").animate({width: "100px", height: "100px", background-size:"100px 100px"},1500);
[04:00:42] <sethetter> I'm trying to use the $.getJSON function but getting no successful callback function. http://jsbin.com/ejehu3/edit Anyone??
[04:00:56] <ravenzz> gotta go
[04:00:56] <ravenzz> bye
[04:02:10] <sethetter> KingDosser: try adding in a callback function at the end.
[04:02:29] <KingDosser> I get this error missing : after property id on line 32

[04:03:29] <sethetter> Paste your code here -> http://pastie.org
[04:03:50] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/arhbehco8s9jfwwzmavtgg
[04:06:42] <KingDosser> = @sethetter
[04:13:36] <KingDosser> sethetter ??

[04:14:13] <KingDosser> http://blackboarddev.com/mynt/mynt.html
[04:15:39] <jzaefferer> anyone around who can tell me how the animated spinning loading icon works in jQuery Mobile? all I find is the non-animated png (themes/default/images/ajax-loader.png)
[04:21:11] <Alexer> is the method used in http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox for extending builtin widgets (in this case, autocomplete) the best one? i mean the: "input.data('autocomplete')._renderItem = function(ul, item){...}" part? is there a better way to "subclass" widgets, replacing some methods on them?
[04:26:32] <KingDosser> Any ideas sethetter?
[04:29:06] <ranza> what would be a good way to check if a browser has history.pushState ?
[04:30:44] <jzaefferer> ranza: var pushSupport = !!(window.history && window.history.pushState);
[04:31:39] <jzaefferer> though in general, take a look at Modernizr what they use for feature detection, e.g. local/sessionStorage needs more then a simple property check
[04:32:12] <ranza> oh im actually using modernizr. Didnt know that it had that check
[04:32:16] <ranza> thanks man!
[04:34:28] <sethetter> KingDosser: sorry buddy still messing with it.
[04:34:33] <fmerges> hi
[04:34:45] <KingDosser> Lol no worries sethetter. Its weird isnt it?
[04:35:26] <sethetter> Very.. I've never used the droppable part of jqueryUI before, so I'm going over the docs for it right now too.
[04:35:33] <KingDosser> Its pretty good
[04:35:36] <sethetter> But everything seems right up front
[04:35:39] <KingDosser> apart from this :)
[04:37:26] <sethetter> right, haha
[04:42:54] <phrearch> anyone knows if there is an easier way of showing a ui accordion thats collapsed at the start, like: $('#new-blog-article-accordion').hide().accordion({collapsible:true}).accordion('activate',1).show(); ?
[04:44:28] <sethetter> KingDosser: the JS is working fine
[04:44:31] <sethetter> it's the css i think
[04:44:36] <KingDosser> really?
[04:44:43] <KingDosser> why would there be a console error then?
[04:44:49] <sethetter> I'm not getting one?
[04:45:08] <KingDosser> [Break On This Error] $("#trash").animate({width: "100...background-size:"100px 100px"},1500);
[04:45:16] <KingDosser> missing : after property id
[04:46:16] <sethetter> http://jsbin.com/owebu5/edit
[04:46:47] <KingDosser> Meh dont worry about it lol?
[04:48:17] <phrearch> hm, http://jsbin.com/areji4/edit
[04:48:33] <phrearch> darn, possible but bloated :/
[04:51:18] <sethetter> KingDosser: got it.. it was the background size property
[04:51:32] <KingDosser> What was wrong with it?
[04:52:15] <sethetter> it should be backgroundSize in the animate function
[04:52:18] <sethetter> i believe
[04:52:21] <KingDosser> oh shit lol
[04:52:28] <sethetter> and setting it to 100% instead of a pixel value
[04:52:38] <sethetter> keeps it stretched, and you can just animate the size of the div
[04:52:38] <sethetter> http://jsfiddle.net/muJA2/
[04:52:41] <sethetter> like so :)
[04:53:17] <sethetter> you might even be able to just take the backgroundSize property out of the animate function
[04:53:27] <sethetter> and just keep it at 100% in your css file
[05:07:26] <ryrych> hi
[05:08:10] <ryrych> why does $.when( this["someMethod"]).then(); not work?
[05:08:21] <ryrych> I need to use this array path
[05:09:55] <ryrych> it doesn't run this["someMethod"]? this["someMethod"]() outside it works
[05:15:23] <ryrych> ah, stupid question ;)

[05:18:53] <Dom1> i got quite a little problem with jquery or jquery ui
[05:18:53] <Dom1> varÂ secondÂ =Â ui.draggable.children(:first).html();
[05:18:53] <Dom1> this line wont work... where is my prob?
[05:19:20] <RandomSort> in which way does it not work?
[05:19:49] <Dom1> nothin in my js works when i uncomment this this
[05:19:56] <linusoleander> What is being returned when using possition() on an element?
[05:19:56] <linusoleander> Is the distance from the center of the object, the corner or the one of the sides?
[05:20:48] <Dom1> so i think it is a syntax problem....
[05:21:18] <RandomSort> Do you get any javascript errors?
[05:21:43] <Dom1> i found nothin in console
[05:22:46] <Dom1> looked again and found Resource interpreted as Font but transferred with MIME type text/html.
[05:23:28] <Dom1> but this wont affect my js, does it?
[05:23:46] <RandomSort> Dom1: maybe try and see what children() returns, and if that is what you expect
[05:24:04] <RandomSort> I'm guessing that doesn't matter Dom1
[05:24:28] <amnesia_> hi, i want to make char counter, I want to use for example circle, when user is typing circle is filling in sectors 1degree = 1 char how can I do this?
[05:25:30] <Dom1> children(:first) was wrong i think. children(first) appears to work! thankyou RandonSort
[05:26:26] <RandomSort> no problem Dom
[05:26:47] <RandomSort> amnesia_: If you have absolutely no clue how to get started with that, it probably is a bit out of your grasp
[05:27:01] <RandomSort> amnesia_: You might be able to find some counter somewhere
[05:29:38] <amnesia_> RandomSort: ok, maybe you can give me some useful links about circles and jquery?
[05:32:14] <RandomSort> I don't know any amnesia_
[05:33:19] <kojiro> I don't remember knowing any amnesia...
[05:39:08] <wilrod> Whats the best way to load a RSS feed through ajax without having that annoying warning showing up?
[05:40:39] <toxz> i can serialize all inputs of a form via .serialize() - can i get all params as an object too?
[05:42:16] <KingDosser> Is there a preg_replace from PHP equivelant in jQuery
[05:43:42] <ablomen> KingDosser, string.replace(/foo/, "bar");
[05:43:58] <Rost> is there a way to repeat a self-invoking function in javascript?
[05:44:38] <KingDosser> Cheers ablomen
[05:44:56] <ablomen> Rost, you mean like function ( ) { console.log("foo"); arguments.callee(); } ?
[05:45:13] <KingDosser> ablomen What about splitting into an array by say a ',' ?
[05:45:24] <ablomen> KingDosser, string.split()
[05:45:31] <KingDosser> haha cheers
[05:45:54] <ablomen> KingDosser, google for mdc, you can get info about basic functions etc from there
[05:46:02] <ablomen> or read a javascript book/tutorial
[05:46:55] <Rost> ablomen, I mean a function like ( function() { })(); , i need it to make a 'inifinte' loop
[05:47:38] <ablomen> Rost, ok.. then try what i typed, arguments.callee()
[05:49:14] <mdsdss> Rost: function a(){ a();} ?
[05:49:57] <Rost> ablomen, that doesnt work :(
[05:50:04] <Rost> mdsdss let me try
[05:51:03] <wilrod> Whats the best way to load a RSS feed through ajax without having that annoying warning showing up?
[05:52:13] <jeffsmykil> Is there a .contains
[05:52:20] <jeffsmykil> for checking the contents of an array?
[05:52:21] <timing> jeffsmykil: yes
[05:52:25] <timing> o no :-)
[05:52:34] <timing> there is $.inArray()
[05:52:38] <jeffsmykil> oh ok
[05:52:45] <Rost> hmm I have it working now but, its using setInterval now. Ive read somewhere that isnt a good function, am I right?
[05:52:46] <phrearch> hm, somehow when i use autoHeight with jquery ui accordion, the content doesnt flow down :/
[05:52:48] <jeffsmykil> and .push for putting items in an array?
[05:52:59] <phrearch> with it set to false it flows, but the down animation is horrible
[05:53:09] <webdeveloper> hey fellows does anyone use the jQuery BBC Plugin?
[05:57:50] <jayflux> no whats that
[05:59:04] <KingDosser> using string.split how would i split a string from the first space
[05:59:29] <KingDosser> SO everything before the first space is foo[0] and everything after is foo[1]
[06:00:26] <jeffsmykil> timing: you still there?
[06:01:54] <kojiro> KingDosser: you can't do that with *just* string.split()
[06:02:59] <kojiro> KingDosser: depending on your needs you could either do a split and a join or a split and truncate from the left with a replace, etc
[06:03:17] <KingDosser> Yeah I just did that kojiro. :) Thanks anyway
[06:04:38] <paladinn> hello all
[06:04:40] <wilrod> IÂ´m using jquerys jgfeed for rss feeds. But I get weird chars for Ã¥Ã¤Ã¶
[06:04:48] <wilrod> How to solve that?
[06:04:53] <paladinn> I need put the timeline of twiiter in 2 divs, anyone know how I do it ?
[06:06:00] <toxz> how can i do something like: http://pastebin.com/qRD2VvhV
[06:08:15] <wilrod> How can I set the characters in a string to UTF-8?
[06:08:46] <toxz> wilrod - in many ways
[06:09:10] <kojiro> KingDosser: yeah, javascript ain't python ;)
[06:09:23] <KingDosser> Is python actually good?
[06:09:38] <kojiro> I suppose it depends what you want to do with it
[06:09:44] <wilrod> toxz, ok, some good way then? ::)
[06:09:57] <kojiro> KingDosser: We're straying dangerously close to OT, but there's also CoffeeScript
[06:10:00] <Zeddy> Whats the best way to send a large array containing Javascript Objects to php?
[06:10:08] <Zeddy> JSON?
[06:10:19] <wilrod> toxz, I have a ajax response that I want to encode to UTF8
[06:10:21] <Zeddy> i read somewhere that JSON is not preffered when sending data _to_ the server
[06:10:33] <kojiro> Zeddy: depends where it's coming from.
[06:10:35] <toxz> wilrod - i think you should encode it on the server
[06:10:42] <toxz> if possible
[06:10:48] <Anitox> :o
[06:10:52] <wilrod> I dont have control of the other end
[06:11:01] <wilrod> toxz
[06:11:06] <Zeddy> kojiro, from one page to another
[06:11:07] <kojiro> Zeddy: given that they're "Javascript objects" can we assume they're coming from the client?
[06:11:13] <Zeddy> yes
[06:11:17] <kojiro> Zeddy: then POST or GET
[06:11:18] <KingDosser> Okay im going to bed
[06:11:23] <KingDosser> Night guys, cheers for all the help
[06:11:25] <wilrod> toxz, I just read from some rss feeds and some of them aint utf8
[06:11:26] <kojiro> KingDosser: nn
[06:11:31] <Getty> LOL.....
[06:11:34] <Zeddy> well yes, but there can be around 50 objects in the array
[06:11:42] <kojiro> Zeddy: POST or GET. :)
[06:11:52] <Getty> this channel has become so worthless.... :)
[06:11:53] <Zeddy> don't i need to JSON encode the array?
[06:12:03] <Getty> unbelievable hehehe
[06:12:05] <kojiro> Zeddy: that depends what the PHP needs to do with it.
[06:12:19] <kojiro> Getty: you get out of it what you put into it
[06:12:29] <toxz> wilrod - i think thats a though task, because encoding on bit-coding level
[06:12:32] <Zeddy> PHP will json_decode it and perform some database stuff
[06:12:50] <toxz> http://phpjs.org/functions/utf8_decode:576
[06:13:00] <toxz> http://phpjs.org/functions/utf8_encode:577
[06:13:13] <kojiro> Zeddy: sure, jsonify it if you like, but it's not likely to be a significant change in the amount of work whether you do it from the server or client in this case.
[06:13:56] <coconutz> anyone has used $.ajax  call with facebook api?
[06:14:16] <jeffsmykil> if (tempRoomNumbers.indexOf(staffTimeline[i].FacilityName)) == -1)
[06:14:23] <jeffsmykil> anyone see anything wrong with that?
[06:15:09] <ximi> @jeffsmykil do you get an error?
[06:15:19] <jeffsmykil> yeah expression error on the ==
[06:15:24] <jeffsmykil> not sure what it wants though
[06:15:56] <Anitox> extra closing parenthesis after FacilityName
[06:16:07] <Anitox> you have a *
[06:16:22] <wilrod> so how to encode a string to utf-8?
[06:16:25] <ximi> yeah
[06:16:30] <jeffsmykil> good call thank you
[06:16:56] <ximi> wilrod, there is at least one jquery plugin for it
[06:17:11] <ximi> though jquerys serialize takes care of it for you if you are sending form data
[06:17:33] <Zeddy> wtf
[06:17:46] <Zeddy> so i can directly send an array from javascript to php without jsoning it?
[06:17:51] <supercabbage> Anyone know if it's possible to select all previous elements?
[06:17:51] <Zeddy> why do we even have JSON? :p
[06:18:36] <Anitox> it formats your data FOR javascript
[06:19:01] <Anitox> sure, you can do whatever, but if you want your arrays and stuff in javascript, use JSON
[06:19:04] <Rost> Why isnt the path in canvas 1px width when i say it :S
[06:19:07] <Anitox> makes life easy
[06:19:39] <ximi> supercabbage can you be more specific?
[06:20:42] <ximi> you have a prevAll() method in jquery that gets all preceding siblings
[06:26:18] <wilrod> I need to read RSS feed cross-domain with ajax but I just get that darn warning, suggestions?
[06:29:34] <fRAiLtY-> How can I countdown to a specific time but not include days. I want to countdown to 10AM everyday but all timers I find include days months etc
[06:30:25] <markj> ?g mdc date @ fRAiLtY-
[06:30:26] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-, Date - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[06:30:40] <markj> the time in js is the clients time though so 10am will be different for different people
[06:33:22] <jezuz> is there a bug in replaceAll? it doesn't seem to be working for me at all
[06:33:40] <jezuz> stupid question perhaps, but the elements just disappear
[06:40:19] <webdeveloper>  how do i support anchor links in jquery?
[06:41:00] <ximi> webdeveloper: what do you mean by support?
[06:41:10] <webdeveloper> implement
[06:41:29] <webdeveloper> using jquery to load content into a div
[06:41:45] <webdeveloper> would like to implement anchor support
[06:42:23] <xec> define anchor support
[06:42:38] <ximi> I assume you're talking about the dynamic loading of content via ajax?
[06:42:44] <cerzi> hi all, im looking to create some kind of system that shows an empty picture frame, and when clicked brings up a popup with a bunch of image thumbnails to choose from, and after selecting one of them the popup closes and the selected image is now sitting in the previously empty frame.. anyone know of a plugin that does this or similar?
[06:42:52] <webdeveloper> jumping inside a html page
[06:42:57] <webdeveloper> ximi: yeah!
[06:43:15] <rick_> hello
[06:43:37] <ximi> Ideally you check out the ajax section of the jquery docs, especially the .load() method: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:43:50] <rick_> was checking the jquery chat
[06:44:54] <rick_> is any available for jquery discussion
[06:45:22] <markj> ?ask @ rick_
[06:45:22] <bot-t> rick_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:45:26] <Anitox> go ahead and ask your question. I'm sure someone will help ya
[06:45:31] <webdeveloper> ximi: thanks, i'll do that
[06:45:32] <ximi> cerzi: the functionality you're describing is not that complex that it would require a plugin, I doubt there is anything out there that does this. You might wanna check out jquery ui, it should provide you everything you need to create such a functionality
[06:45:34] <webdeveloper> :)
[06:45:54] <cerzi> great, thanks ximi - I'm new to the language but was starting to get the same impression. ta
[06:49:58] <compuv> $(...).append($("<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"alert(\"How do you correctly escape the quotes around me?\");\">Question</a>"))
[06:50:09] <Brodingo> use single quotes
[06:50:46] <Brodingo> 'heres the sting use as many """"""""" as you please'
[06:50:54] <Brodingo> r
[06:51:10] <compuv> Brodingo: If I cant? The contents is actually rather a lot of markup/script generated by a bit of code I have no real control of.
[06:51:10] <Brodingo> also no onclick, bind with jquery
[06:51:27] <compuv> Just trying to illustrate the question with the onclick
[06:51:42] <ximi> compuv: additionally I would recommend you to just append the anchor and then bind the click event on the anchor
[06:51:48] <xec> compuv: the ugly way would be something like \\" i suppose
[06:51:51] <ximi> ok, sorry
[06:52:20] <compuv> xec: That was my guess, but it moans about ILLEGAL something or other when I try escaping the slashes/
[06:52:51] <compuv> About ready to give up on this. You guys are my last roll of the dice.
[06:52:52] <xec> add moar slashes! or do it properly :)
[06:53:18] <compuv> WYB I did? \\\" is no better
[06:53:27] <xec> hehe dammit
[06:53:45] <ximi> compuv: you could use single quotes for the outer quotes
[06:54:53] <compuv> I had some success with that ximi but just when I thought it was working I found some generated content that tripped up on the single quotes too.
[06:55:27] <compuv> Quits me think. Find some new way to do this.
[07:10:05] <Rotham> how can I get the id of an element that was just clicked (in the click function)?
[07:10:34] <kojiro> $(this).id or $(this).attr('id')
[07:12:23] <Rotham> thanks
[07:13:15] <mbrevda> is have a setTimeout in a for loop in an ajax success function. Its job is to parse the data returned and to display it with a delay
[07:13:29] <mbrevda> nm - I think I got it
[07:18:00] <Rotham> how can I pass additional data to the success handler for .post ?
[07:18:42] <mbrevda> how can you convert a sting to an object?
[07:20:29] <mbrevda> *tring
[07:20:38] <mbrevda> arrrr. STRING
[07:22:47] <ZeuZ> Is there any problem in mixing prototype library with jQuery? If so, is there any plugin for COMET to jQuery?
[07:25:37] <Vaerros> hm, encountering an error when I do e.draggable('destroy') --> d(this).data("draggable") is undefined
[07:26:09] <Vaerros> I'm using an array of detached draggables, and in this case, it's arr[i].draggable('destroy'). $(arr[i]).draggable('destroy') also errors
[07:26:33] <sero|work> zeuz you can set jquery to play nice with other libs such as prototype
[07:26:48] <mbrevda> how do you add to an object as you would do array[] = 'new value'?
[07:27:31] <sero|work> zeuz: jQuery.noConflict();
[07:27:53] <Vaerros> mbrevda: afaik, values need properties in objects
[07:28:40] <ZeuZ> sero|work, I was just reading that from jQuery docs, yeah.. However I saw this: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Comet wich perhaps makes more sense than rewritting all of my other scripts to use $j instead of $ (for an example - although find & replace would do it easy)
[07:28:56] <ZeuZ> Does anybody know how well does jQuery.COMET work?
[07:31:48] <Vaerros> n/m, fixed it (http://old.nabble.com/Problem-destroying-draggable-td22181361s27240.html if anyone needs info)
[07:34:11] <DoctorDarren> Hey, I have an element with inline css on a page. How can I add another inline css property to this element without overwriting the inline properties already on it?
[07:34:21] <DoctorDarren> Is this snippet the best idea?:  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/make-css-inline#14737000001512483
[07:35:31] <ChristianAdamski> Hey, if I have two jquery objects/elements (an image and a link) and I want to bind a click event to both of them?
[07:35:54] <ChristianAdamski> Or other way to ask, how do I combine two variables to behave identically?
[07:36:16] <ZeuZ> DoctorDarren, well I'm a beginner but perhaps you should add an id in the HTML, and then add the desired addressing it with $("#id_of_element_with_inline_css")
[07:37:27] <cfurrow> ChristianAdamski, can you not query for the two objects, and apply the client event in one line? $(".somelink, .someimage").click(...)
[07:37:55] <DoctorDarren> ZeuZ: Yeah it already has an ID in the html. The problem is that if I do $('#id_of_element).css('color', 'red')  It will get rid of all the existing inline CSS and just leave color: red
[07:37:56] <cfurrow> ChristianAdamski: click* event, that is
[07:38:59] <ChristianAdamski> cfurrow, well no, thats rather complicated. But I did that in the script earlier (each) and stored the results in variables. I'm thinking of sth like $(avar, anothervar).click()
[07:39:36] <phlp> ChristianAdamski: one.add(two).click()
[07:40:26] <ZeuZ> DoctorDarren, use $("id_of_element").css($("#id_of_element").css()) and this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/447197/how-to-define-multiple-css-attributes-in-jquery
[07:41:26] <ZeuZ> Perhaps I did some mess trying to explain, sorry if I did
[07:43:03] <DoctorDarren> ZeuZ: Wow I didn't think that recursion-type syntax would work, will give it a shot. Thanks!
[07:46:31] <fRAiLtY-> This is my script : http://jsfiddle.net/HGWfs/ But I want the animation from this script: http://jsfiddle.net/NjvPG/1/ and join them together, all the time calcualations work on my original script but I can't get the animation to transfer?
[07:49:50] <ZeuZ> DoctorDarren, let me know if it works out :)
[07:51:36] <SDr_> hi guys,
[07:51:59] <SDr_> Using a sortable jqueryUI table, I need to also handle drag&drop events
[07:52:25] <SDr_> namely, items can be 1, put inbetween 2 items (sorted), and 2, dropped on top of an item
[07:52:56] <SDr_> if this isn't possible using jqueryUI , do you have any component suggestion, that can do this?
[07:54:20] <m0dmd> SDr_ it is possible, but you gotta learn how to do it.
[07:54:37] <SDr_> m0dmd, okay, any relevant documentation you can point me forward to?
[07:55:05] <m0dmd> SDr_ http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[07:55:29] <ravenzz> fRAiLtY- http://jsfiddle.net/HGWfs/2/
[07:55:34] <SDr_> m0dmd, been through all these, failed to find any relevant examples, which illustrates *both* functionality
[07:55:51] <m0dmd> start with one example
[07:56:01] <m0dmd> then learn how to use the other example at the same time!
[07:56:08] <m0dmd> integrate*
[07:56:25] <m0dmd> knowledge of programming required!
[07:56:52] <fRAiLtY-> ravenzz: You have editied the end right?
[07:56:53] <ravenzz> fRAiLtY- i made that working, but i don't pay attention at the countdown routine...
[07:57:19] <ravenzz> fRAiLtY- yes the end, ticker = setInterval(
[07:57:19] <ravenzz> tick, 1000);
[07:57:32] <ravenzz>     ticker = setInterval(tick, 1000); <- this
[07:57:37] <fRAiLtY-> How do I get the animation working?
[07:58:26] <ravenzz> and obviously i called the 1st function getSeconds() to start the "routine"
[07:58:34] <ravenzz> which animation?
[08:00:45] <fRAiLtY-> This is my script : http://jsfiddle.net/HGWfs/ But I want the animation from this script: http://jsfiddle.net/NjvPG/1/ and join them together, all the time calcualations work on my original script but I can't get the animation to transfer?
[08:01:39] <fRAiLtY-> The second script is a apple style flipover countdown click, it does exactly what I want except I want my time script to be used instead of the standard one and I can't figure out how :/
[08:01:51] <fRAiLtY-> I have both compments separately working, just together I struggle.
[08:02:18] <DoctorDarren> ZeuZ: Yeah it worked, unfortunately the CSS didn't help the alignment problem... Off to #css!
[08:02:19] <the_hack> Anyone want to take on a Passenger question?
[08:02:47] <ravenzz> fRAiLtY- have you got a live example?
[08:02:54] <ravenzz> i would see it in action
[08:04:09] <jacksonje> I am trying to extract selected values from a <select> element that contains values with an apostrophe. But when I retrieve it via jquery, apostrophe strings are truncated. Any suggestions?
[08:04:56] <the_hack> Anyone want to take on a Passenger/deployment question? I've read the docs and tinkered but still need clarification
[08:06:00] <matschaffer> the_hack: tried #rails or is it actually a jquery question?
[08:06:39] <the_hack> matschaffer: Sorry, I thought I was on #rails!
[08:06:54] <matschaffer> hehe, fair enough. Pretty sure this is #jquery :-P
[08:10:34] <tra> I have a $.each() doing some stuff and i need to run a function after the $.each() has done it's job. I can accomplish it somehow by setTimeout() but sometimes the $.each() might take a couple seconds longer and the timeout will be triggered too early. Can i use $.when().done(func) for this?
[08:11:24] <ajpiano> tra: you should check the size of the thing you're iterating over, and if you're on the last iteration, call a function
[08:11:40] <ajpiano> using a timeout for that is  a bad idea
[08:11:44] <tra> ajpiano: how about $.when() ?
[08:11:49] <mbrevda> using this as an argument for ajax - how come only the first item is being posted? data: ({ajax:'status_update', l: last_update}),
[08:11:50] <tra> yeah i noticed :)
[08:11:53] <ajpiano> $.each doesn't return a promise
[08:11:57] <ajpiano> so $.when won't work for tha
[08:12:03] <tra> k, thanks...
[08:13:45] <SDr_> okay, so: I've set up a sortable, and set each element in it droppable. However, jqueryui doesn't allow for the dragged element to be dragged *in between* two elements, without simulteniously selecting it to be dropped on the element above / below the placeholder
[08:13:56] <fRAiLtY-> ravenzz: http://dev2.printpartnerships.com/countdown/index.html is the output of this: http://jsfiddle.net/NjvPG/2/
[08:14:09] <fRAiLtY-> I already have the timer functionality, I just want to take advantage of the flipover effect
[08:14:22] <SDr_> this kinda sucks, because spec defines behaviour for both dropping onto an element, *and* dropping inbetween 2 elements
[08:14:32] <Rotham> hey
[08:14:55] <Rotham> $(".my_class") should work even if the class is one of many in a list right?
[08:14:56] <SDr_> I've also tried setting the placeholder's height to eg. 100px; however this just made the droppables confused about the mouse coordinates
[08:15:14] <SDr_> Rotham, see $.each
[08:15:27] <SDr_> Rotham, in sort: not the way you think it'd work.
[08:15:58] <SDr_> Rotham, try $(".my_class").each( function() { $(this).f() ; } ); instead.
[08:16:10] <ravenzz> fRAiLtY- dunno, maybe you miss the images
[08:16:44] <SDr_> so, is there any way to have both drop onto other element, and drop inbetween elements, handled?
[08:16:52] <Rotham> SDr_ if I want to add a click handler, do I have to use .each still?
[08:16:59] <SDr_> Rotham, yup
[08:17:04] <ajpiano> huh, no
[08:17:10] <fRAiLtY-> ravenzz: But I don't know what bits to remove and what bits to add?
[08:17:17] <fRAiLtY-> ravenzz: How to merge the 2 scripts
[08:17:33] <ajpiano> Rotham: what do you mean by "one of many in a list"
[08:17:44] <ravenzz> just copy this http://dev2.printpartnerships.com/countdown/index.html
[08:17:44] <ravenzz> ?
[08:17:49] <ajpiano> if you have multiple elements in a jquery object and you want to assign a click handler to all of them, you don't have to use $.each
[08:18:06] <SDr_> ajpiano, whoops, my bad then.
[08:18:14] <ajpiano> np
[08:18:16] <SDr_> ajpiano, got any ideas on my issue above?
[08:18:20] <ajpiano> SDr_, i wish i did
[08:18:21] <ajpiano> :(
[08:18:52] <SDr_> ajpiano, is this a well-known missing functionality, or do you feel this should be possible?
[08:19:22] <ajpiano> SDr_, it sounds like a typical one of the annoying edgecases that isn't currently handled well by the interaction plugins
[08:19:27] <fRAiLtY-> ravenzz: I have that script already, but it counts down wrong, how could I make that script count to 10AM then restart, like my script?
[08:19:32] <Rotham> ajpiano:  What I originally meant was 1 of multiple classes attached to a single item, but SDr_ answered a question I probably would have run into once I started actually using this... I am writing a little jquery function to create a single click handler for a set of buttons, that will send the button id along with the request, and the server figures out what to do with it then.
[08:19:39] <ajpiano> i'm surprised you have sortable and draggable and droppable working on table rows at all, SDr_ :)
[08:19:56] <ajpiano> Rotham: cool story ;)
[08:20:09] <ajpiano> yes, if you have multiple classes and you do $(".foo") and foo is one of those classes, it will select that element
[08:20:20] <ajpiano> and any other foos
[08:20:23] <SDr_> ajpiano, what can I say, I'm too sexy for jquery :P
[08:20:27] <ajpiano> hehe
[08:20:27] <Rotham> it almost deserves tl;dr :/

[08:21:50] <jeffsmykil> does append automatically add closing <divs>?
[08:22:13] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: depends on what you really mean
[08:22:30] <skylamer`> any jqueryists here? :)
[08:22:32] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: It;s adding a closing div for me when I don't want it to
[08:22:34] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: in general you need to think of elements when appending stuff, not strings of html
[08:22:39] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: yeah, that's the problem
[08:22:50] <jeffsmykil> so what should i use instead of append?
[08:22:50] <ajpiano> you're thinking of append and similar methods as like, building a string-y dom
[08:22:53] <ajpiano> when in reality you have to build elements
[08:23:01] <ajpiano> nothing
[08:23:03] <skylamer`> how to make when its clicked out of some element to call some "function()" ? :)
[08:23:03] <ajpiano> you should use append, you just have to understand what it means
[08:23:12] <skylamer`> mouseout is bugged
[08:23:18] <ajpiano> ?g jquery outside events @ skylamer`
[08:23:19] <bot-t> skylamer`, Ben Alman » jQuery outside events: Why trigger an event on ... - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[08:23:35] <ravenzz> fRAiLtY- you could take a look at this http://cnanney.com/journal/code/apple-style-counter-revisited/#demo
[08:24:03] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: ill take another look at the documentation
[08:24:19] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: ok
[08:24:42] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: the basic gist is that you don't just like "insert opening div tag" then "insert content" then "insert more content" and then "insert closing div tag"
[08:24:47] <ajpiano> you have to build the entire content and then append it
[08:25:05] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: yeah, unfortunately that's what I was trying to do.
[08:25:16] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: I guess I need to rethink my structure
[08:25:39] <ajpiano> yup
[08:28:59] <skylamer`> thank you
[08:29:00] <skylamer`> bot-t
[08:29:31] <skylamer`> ajPIANO, so i can bind a n event for click outside and keypress ( escape inex. ) for one thing? :)
[08:29:53] <ajpiano> i guess?
[08:29:58] <ajpiano> that question isn't exactly "clear"
[08:30:16] <skylamer`> im saying two listeners - one element :D)
[08:30:34] <ajpiano> yes
[08:30:43] <skylamer`> so they're both activating if one of them is active some thing like in '"or" :D)'
[08:30:47] <skylamer`> thanks :      )
[08:33:54] <morphine> validation plugin: I have a form here that's using it, and if it checks out OK, I submit it via an ajax request. However, the server-side script can return errors about form fields (for example, several fields are secondary IDs). Is there any way to simply tell the validation plugin to trigger an invalidation of a specific field?
[08:36:13] <fresher> plz can any one help me
[08:36:39] <necromancer> morphine: which validation plugin, jQuery.validate? i believe you can make a custom rule, but i've never done it successfully before. I heard jQuery Tools' validation plugin is easier for that kind of thing.
[08:37:02] <fresher> how to develop a jqgrid in asp.net
[08:37:38] <necromancer> morphine: you're basically looking for asynchronous server-side validation, right?
[08:37:56] <morphine> necromancer: no, not really, I'll explain better
[08:39:11] <fresher> is der any body
[08:39:20] <SDr_> hai
[08:39:25] <fresher> hai
[08:39:27] <m0dmd> hai
[08:39:36] <morphine> necromancer: the form uses the validation plugin, and it's all OK. However, I also need to do server-side checks at submit time (can't do them before because of database transactions). If a field fails the server-side check, I'd like to mark it as failed, via the same validation plugin. Basically, I'm looking for Validator.invalidate(field)
[08:39:54] <morphine> necromancer: I know that I can trigger checks for fields whenever, but I can't find a way to just tell it "this field is wrong, mark it as such"
[08:40:16] <SDr_> fresher, ask concrete questions to get concrete help.
[08:40:35] <fresher> plz tel me how to implement  jqgrid in asp.net web application
[08:42:41] <Genk1> hello
[08:43:58] <Genk1> I have a problem with my auto fill select box code when I use the Jnice library.. this last one rename the class name of my inputs so the code doesn't work anymore
[08:44:07] <Genk1> any suggestions please ?
[08:46:10] <ximi> can't you pass in the new class that jnice assigns to the element? has jnice a callback that fires when it completes, you could run your code then
[08:48:04] <Genk1> ximi: hmm, the jnice documentation is poor and I doubt I will find such info.. but I will check.. thanks for the ideas
[08:48:44] <ximi> alternatively you could use live in combination with new class
[08:49:06] <Genk1> ok
[08:50:15] <necromancer> morphine: are you using jQuery.validate? there's a lot of validation plugins out there.
[08:50:19] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you still around?
[08:50:26] <necromancer> jQuery.validate isn't known for being terribly malleable
[08:51:00] <morphine> necromancer: yes, that one. And yes, I've noticed that too. It's powerful, but the documentation is nearly non-existant and very hard to get it to do what you want
[08:51:14] <morphine> necromancer: I may have found something though... showErrors(), trying that
[08:51:22] <jeffsmykil> necromancer can you add a class to a div using a variable inside of an append?
[08:51:40] <jeffsmykil> necromancer: kind of like this but so it works $(".containingBox").append("<div class=\"row\"" + i + "></div>");
[08:52:05] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: that should work, yeah
[08:52:08] <dabear> jquery validity <3
[08:52:20] <morphine> dabear: link?
[08:52:22] <jeffsmykil> it doesn't necromance, I'm stuck in \" hell
[08:52:25] <dabear> http://validity.thatscaptaintoyou.com/
[08:52:33] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: that's because you have an extra quote in there. look at your markup
[08:52:38] <morphine> dabear: thanks, bookmarked for later
[08:52:44] <necromancer> you're generating <div class="row" someotherclass"></div>"
[08:52:47] <jeffsmykil> yeah I did, but if i remove that it doesnt work either
[08:52:49] <necromancer> that doesn't look valid :)
[08:53:22] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: first of all, use single quotes
[08:53:35] <jeffsmykil> oh
[08:53:37] <jeffsmykil> i can do that?
[08:53:38] <jeffsmykil> lol
[08:53:39] <m0dmd> morphine you gotta look at the jquery-validation.js file to see how the functions work.
[08:53:40] <necromancer> makes your life easier
[08:53:41] <necromancer> yeah
[08:53:48] <jeffsmykil> that would be soooo much easier
[08:53:49] <necromancer> and unlike C, it doesn't denote the type
[08:53:50] <m0dmd> the documentation didn't keep up with the code updates :)
[08:53:58] <necromancer> jeffsmykil: it should be .append('<div class="row '+i+'"></div>');
[08:54:04] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil, don't escape quotes, just use singles and doubles... $("foo").append("<div class='row"_ + i + "'>whatever</div>");
[08:54:23] <morphine> m0dmd: heh... without trying to be too snarky, when one has to look at the source, then the fail whale has already beached.
[08:54:24] <m0dmd> morphine I know that some of the so called methods in the documentation aren't actually methods.
[08:54:30] <jeffsmykil> what is the underscore ajpiano
[08:54:36] <ajpiano> i put an underscore there
[08:54:45] <morphine> m0dmd: though yes, you're correct anyway :)
[08:54:46] <m0dmd> morphine it's good code, just documentation doesn't match up
[08:55:00] <DC1> does anyone know of a channel where I can test my honey pot?
[08:55:02] <morphine> yeah, wasn't criticizing the code in itself
[08:55:04] <necromancer> yeah the only time i escape quotes is if i'm in php and i want to inject vars into a syntax-highlighted SQL statement, or if i'm in ruby and i want to inject vars into a string
[08:55:24] <m0dmd> necro loves injecting things!
[08:55:31] <necromancer> mmmmmmmmmm especially hot beef
[08:55:41] <m0dmd> hah, gotta go prepare a late breakfast.
[08:55:44] <m0dmd> return in a few.
[08:56:20] * jeffsmykil hugs ajpiano and extends a fake hand on a stick towards necromancer
[08:56:23] <jeffsmykil> thanks guys
[09:06:13] <systemfault> What is a good jQuery plugin tutorial (Writing them)
[09:07:44] <SkiOne> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[09:07:59] <systemfault> Thank you SkiOne :)
[09:08:09] <SkiOne> gurgle 4 tehwin
[09:08:15] <SkiOne> uw
[09:08:16] <kojiro> gurgle!
[09:08:21] <martco> the alert window inside the callback function of my $.post() requests isn't showing until i hit refresh
[09:08:24] <martco> any ideas?
[09:08:34] <martco> thanks alot, this is weird and the first time i've seen this
[09:10:37] <systemfault> SkiOne: I don't know exactly why but I was looking for "jquery widget tutorial" :(
[09:13:41] <necromancer> systemfault: i like this one too http://www.virgentech.com/blog/2009/10/building-object-oriented-jquery-plugin.html
[09:13:59] <necromancer> lets you do stuff like ('#selector').myPlugin().someMethod();
[09:14:10] <systemfault> Ah good :)
[09:14:39] <necromancer> be careful though, you can easily destroy chainability doing that. remember to always return a jQuery object!
[09:14:53] <systemfault> Except when I don't want to :P
[09:15:10] <systemfault> jQuery exagerates a bit imho :/
[09:15:19] <systemfault> With .end() for example..
[09:23:41] <raver> hi... how can i trigger an action when a string entered in a text box reaches 4 characters?
[09:24:04] <raver> right now i am using: live("change", function (event) { but this only works after the box loses focus
[09:24:40] <raver> i would like an "as you type" alternative
[09:24:47] <SilentPenguin> necromancer, that link to designing jquery plugins has flawed logic for a method string, it's entirely possible to create a structure in which you can both have any method name you want, not write a switcher /and/ reject methods that do not exist.
[09:25:04] <senn_> Hello all, I have a <script src='site.com/player.js'></script> I've wanting to run on a certain event... current the script include is sent back from an ajax response and it renders a media player using $('#container').load('url/to/script/ajax'); ... the problem is the rendered media player doesnt load in the container, it loads at the bottom of the page? can I target where it gets spat out?
[09:25:25] <senn_> I'm *
[09:26:04] <phlp> raver: http://api.jquery.com/keydown
[09:26:44] <senn_> if it include the <script src=''></script in the html on load... it renders in the right place, but trying to render it in the same place dyanmically after load causes it to render the media player at the bottom of the document... as if it's being appended to body
[09:27:09] <martco> how can i redirect to or render the page that i'm sending a post request to?
[09:27:17] <martco> after successful post?
[09:27:43] <SilentPenguin> senn_, sounds like you are overcomplicating the issue, i'd suggest writing it as a plugin instead, then calling your plugin rather than any sort of jiggery pokery
[09:27:57] <senn_> a plugin to do what?
[09:28:04] <necromancer> SilentPenguin: that's true, but i still think it looks better to have methods chained onto the end of the plugin
[09:28:38] <senn_> effectively all I want to do is include a  snippet of javascript which outputs a media player (all contained within a file) into a certain div
[09:28:39] <necromancer> and it's a lot easier to understand on both ends: the programmer isn't trying to figure out what to pass into the function and the plugin isn't trying to figure out what to do with the arguments that have been input
[09:28:57] <SilentPenguin> oh yes, it sure does, but it's not what jquery's implementers seem to prefer (based on the JqueryUi)
[09:29:04] <martco> :(
[09:29:30] <senn_> I think a plugin for my case is over complicating the issue
[09:29:35] <senn_> it's not a reusable component
[09:29:40] <senn_> it's a one off include
[09:29:52] <senn_> which needs to be injected into a container
[09:30:04] <SilentPenguin> it's not hard to flick between the two really anyway, return either the list of functions themselves, or use the string to switch between them.
[09:30:08] <edoloughlin> Is there an alternative to XMLSerializer for (pre IE9) Internet Explorer?
[09:31:54] <SilentPenguin> senn_, well, from the sounds of it, you're having headaches, so i'd disagree ;P. i tend to use plugins for enclosed behaviour regardless, because if it turns out that it is reusable, well shucks, you've already done it ;P
[09:32:31] <senn_> the method of implementation doesn't really solve my issue of not being able to create the desired functionality in the first place... regardless of how I wrap it up
[09:32:43] <senn_> once it works, then I can consider decoupling it from the rest of the code...
[09:33:06] <senn_> do you have any idea on how to inject a <script> includes response into a container?
[09:34:35] <raver> phlp: thanks.. it seems to work, but buggy.. i have a check for the number of characters.. when it reaches 4 it should trigger an ajax request... but it seems to ignore 4 characters. As soon as 5 characters are in, it executes the query twice, once for 4 chars. and one for 5 chars
[09:36:09] <martco> how can i redirect to or render the page that i'm sending a post request to?
[09:36:09] <martco> after successful post?
[09:36:25] <raver> phlp or anyone.. can you spot any problems in this small code? http://jsfiddle.net/KPDKH/
[09:36:41] <raver> martco, you should do it from the programming language.. if it's php you use the header() function
[09:37:19] <senn_> martco: can't you just do a window.location on success?
[09:37:26] <senn_> window.location='url'
[09:37:43] <raver> success is only on the server side :)
[09:37:51] <raver> to be sure it processed ok
[09:37:56] <morphine> grrrrr
[09:38:02] <senn_> yes but you're using $ajax ?
[09:38:03] <morphine> I'm starting to become seriously pissed at jQuery.validate
[09:38:15] <morphine> edging close to the "throw this out the window" point
[09:38:22] <senn_> raver: ?
[09:38:40] <raver> ah, regarding my issue.. yes i am
[09:39:04] <senn_> ok so can't you send back a response (boolen) to the success:function(data) {} param
[09:39:13] <senn_> and within that method, window.location='url';
[09:39:22] <raver> the entire ajax part works, i just need it to trigger only when 4 chars have been entered in the #LocationPostcode box
[09:39:23] <senn_> you could even send back the url destination
[09:39:31] <raver> i don't need redirect :)
[09:39:56] <senn_> sorry wrong guy, martco
[09:40:16] <raver> yes :) but how about my issue? any thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/KPDKH/
[09:41:03] <senn_> does val() return a numeric result ?
[09:41:07] <senn_> I don't think you need length
[09:41:14] <Edler> senn_ it returns a string
[09:41:29] <raver> senn, i do use length there
[09:41:44] <raver> it just triggers on the 5th character, and then it sends two requests.. one for 4 chars, one for 5
[09:42:07] <phlp> raver: when using keydown the key wouldnt have made it to val in the keydown event. you can use keyup or even keypress if you want to exclude things like shift. http://jsfiddle.net/KPDKH/1
[09:42:09] <raver> so if i type 2222 nothing happens... if i type 22222 it sends 2222 and 22222
[09:43:06] <raver> BEAUTIFUL!! thanks phlp :)
[09:43:11] <raver> works like a charm
[09:43:18] <Guest8167> hi. I want to disable all events in iframe. I do this way http://pastebin.com/CAVgRSFS but it doesnt remove some onlick events binded in iframe.
[09:43:58] <martco> senn_: thanks. i was hoping to use Jquery
[09:44:08] <senn_> ???
[09:44:18] <senn_> when javascript does it for you?
[09:45:16] <martco> does what?
[09:45:42] <martco> senn_: you ever see a .post() show up as a GET in the browser console?
[09:47:03] <martco> has anyone ever seen a .post() call show up as a GET in the browser console?
[09:48:26] <DyeA> newp
[09:48:50] <DyeA> martco:maybe there is an error in your code somewhere and it is defaulting to GET?
[09:49:07] <martco> yeah maybe
[09:49:13] <j00bar> howdy! i'm looking for an autocomplete widget that is like a <select> element - it has a display value and a real value - jqueryui autocomplete does the separate display/real value in the listing of autocomplete options, but once you select your option, it uses the real value, not the display - can anybody recommend another widget?
[09:49:39] <ximi>  I'm not sure if this is possible, but you might be overwriting your ajax settings with $.ajaxSetup...
[09:53:15] <merkury> Anyone got a solution for this? http://jsfiddle.net/629Le/11/  The page will have around 40-50 parent divs per page, and I need this effect for each individual one
[09:55:43] <queden> Hi folks. I am looking for a coda-style slide effect to switch between pages. However, I don't want the pages to be preloaded, so I am looking for a .load or ajax solution.
[09:58:14] <phlp> merkury: http://jsfiddle.net/629Le/12
[09:59:13] <merkury> wow thanks phlp I don't know why I didn't think of that before :)
[10:00:21] <dragoonis> can <option> tags have classes ?
[10:00:28] <dragoonis> i think theres a cross-browser bug here
[10:00:54] <dragoonis> some <option> tags have a class of 'hidden' and they are visible on Chrome Mac but on Chrome Windows they're hidden
[10:01:02] <kojiro> dragoonis: yes, option can have class
[10:01:08] <dragoonis> see ^
[10:01:19] <kojiro> interesting
[10:01:25] <kojiro> same v of chrom?
[10:02:10] <kojiro> Dr4g: have you eliminated the possibility that it's a browser-default-stylesheet-specificity bug?
[10:02:23] <Dr4g> what do you mean
[10:02:36] <Dr4g> the user-agent styles will be overriden by that of my class
[10:03:07] <kojiro> Dr4g: I'm sure there's a bug
[10:03:13] <Dr4g> looks like it
[10:03:20] <Dr4g> btu not a jquery bug, just a browser bug
[10:03:24] <kojiro> yeah
[10:03:53] <kojiro> Dr4g: can you select the option by class on the Mac?
[10:07:09] <Dr4g> kojiro: i will get back to you
[10:07:35] <kojiro> k
[10:09:49] <pallet> Hi all
[10:10:51] <pallet> quick question, I need to clear a form field, am I right in doing.... jQuery("#idname").value(""); ?
[10:11:13] <kojiro> pallet: does it work? :)
[10:11:29] <DyeA> sounds find to me
[10:11:34] <DyeA> unless its a checkbox
[10:11:46] <kojiro> heh
[10:11:49] <phlp> pallet: .val('')
[10:11:53] <d4rklit3> can js functions handle      function foobar(foo, bar = "default value")
[10:12:08] <e-anima> hi
[10:12:31] <e-anima> i am kind of stuck. i can select all stylesheetfiles like var linkElements = $('head link[rel=stylesheet]')
[10:12:43] <DyeA> phlp: why ''
[10:12:56] <e-anima> problem is now they are  used with @import url('');
[10:13:04] <phlp> '' or "" doesnt matter. the point was he used .value and not .val
[10:13:12] <e-anima> should that work with the same approach?
[10:13:12] <DyeA> o
[10:13:14] <DyeA> right
[10:14:06] <d4rklit3> is there aw ay to make a simple span or li into a button
[10:14:09] <d4rklit3> w/ a hover state
[10:14:34] <acidjazz> ask your penis
[10:17:40] <pallet> awesome
[10:19:16] <DyeA> d4rklit3: no thats php stylee, js cant do that, there is no option for setting a default value inside parens like that
[10:19:46] <wilrod> how can I load RSS feed through ajax without having that darn warning about cross-domain traffic (the page is accessing information on...)?
[10:19:52] <adamjleonard> exit
[10:21:00] <DyeA> e-anima:you should avoid @import if possible, looks like you will have to get the contents of the script tag and parse it for the content you want
[10:21:22] <DyeA> wilrod: there are plugins for this
[10:22:37] <wilrod> DyeA, any recommended one? I tried one that used the google feed but got problems with char encoding
[10:24:14] <DyeA> wilrod: actually now that I think about it (i just did this on a site) i use yui lol
[10:24:59] <srj55> I'm using facebox and I have dynamic content on my page.  each time new content is added, i want to have the new links point to a facebox, but how do i initialize these?  i need to call ('#somenewlink').facebox() but the new links don't have ids
[10:25:29] <srj55> can i use .live() somehow?
[10:25:50] <e-anima> [19:20] <DyeA> e-anima:you should avoid @import if possible, looks like you will have to get the contents of the script tag and parse it for the content you want
[10:25:57] <e-anima> i can not avoid this, thx i will try
[10:31:31] <DyeA> wilrod:here is the code I ended up with, http://jsfiddle.net/ttdKn/, I didnt pretty it up or anything, its a mix of jquery with a call to yql to handle parsing the rss
[10:32:02] <e-anima> DyeA so like, var linkElements = $('head style[type=text/css]')
[10:32:10] <e-anima> and then parse and filter linkElements?
[10:33:13] <systemfault> wtf..
[10:33:29] <systemfault> Why do you select style tags if you want link?
[10:33:57] <systemfault> var apple = $('orange');
[10:37:20] <e-anima> systemfault i want the urls from @import url("test.css");
[10:37:34] <e-anima> but i do not know a selctor do select that directly
[10:37:44] <e-anima> systemfault i am thanfuly for any hints and tips
[10:37:58] <systemfault> e-anima: I don't think it's possible... I would just select the style tag then check the innerHTML
[10:38:08] <systemfault> e-anima: Them use javascript to parse :(
[10:38:10] <systemfault> *Then
[10:38:19] <e-anima> thats what i try to do
[10:38:19] <e-anima> [19:33] <systemfault> Why do you select style tags if you want link?
[10:38:49] <systemfault> e-anima: The other suggestion was right though.. it's stupid to use import :(
[10:39:05] <e-anima> systemfault sadly thats implemented in the cor of the cms
[10:39:13] <e-anima> so i can not chose if i want it or not
[10:39:32] <systemfault> e-anima: That's usually the problem with CMS... they're done by people who don't know anything about frontend
[10:39:56] <systemfault> So you get that kind of things.. and shitty markup overall.
[10:41:19] <e-anima> hehe
[10:43:02] <SDr_> hey guys,
[10:43:11] <SDr_> http://jsfiddle.net/uTu2w/1/
[10:44:22] <d4rklit3> is there something jquery that will format dates
[10:44:51] <kojiro> d4rklit3: oh, so many want to know that
[10:45:05] <fris> d4rklit3 http://datejs.com is nice
[10:45:09] <kojiro> actually, JAVASCRIPT needs to fscking step up and stop sucking at datetime formatting
[10:45:17] <kojiro> it's the single biggest hole
[10:46:04] <necromancer> haha
[10:46:18] <necromancer> kojiro: go ask the magic javascript fairy to change that for you
[10:47:05] <kojiro> necromancer: I tried, but the tooth fairy picked up and wouldn't forward the message.
[10:47:28] <necromancer> kojiro: of course, because the magic javascript fairy has been zonked out on heroin for like 10 years
[10:48:26] <kojiro> necromancer: which explains Actionscript 3
[10:49:37] <necromancer> kojiro: yep. thankfully, rehab came along and coffeescript is around
[10:49:42] <kojiro> :)
[10:50:05] <necromancer> the best part about javascript is that you can't argue 100% for it
[10:50:18] <kojiro> hmm?
[10:50:40] <kojiro> anyone who argues 100% for anything is selling something
[10:50:51] <kojiro> That's my story and I'm sticking to it
[10:50:53] <necromancer> like for php, ruby, etc., arguments over which language is better usually gets down to the business of personal preference
[10:51:05] <kojiro> or someone's mom
[10:51:07] <necromancer> like "ruby does things this way but i'd rather it look like this"
[10:51:13] <systemfault> Or pure insanity.
[10:51:18] <necromancer> yeah
[10:51:22] <kojiro> or how someone's mom is insane
[10:51:40] <Pierro> hello all
[10:51:44] <kojiro> hi, Pierro
[10:51:59] <Pierro> someone know how to do a preloading page for jquerymobile?
[10:57:17] <wilrod> can I retrieve xml (RSS feed) as jsonp?
[10:57:27] <d4rklit3> i have a SQL DateTime formatted string i want to parse, is there a library to parse that specifically
[10:57:31] <NackNick> can someone help me for a sec, i made a calculator and for some reason its not funtioning http://jsfiddle.net/mfggc/
[10:57:53] <NackNick> whenever i click the button, it doesnt get the results it just sits
[10:58:40] <beasty> d4rklit3: http://www.datejs.com/
[10:59:40] <ngharo> how the hell do I get a console in firebug while i'm stepping through code via a breakpoint
[10:59:52] <NackNick> lol
[10:59:59] <ngharo> i mean a console within the context of line im at
[11:00:31] <ngharo> ugh nm
[11:00:36] <ngharo> curse you firebug!
[11:01:44] <aendo> hey guys
[11:02:47] <aendo> i have a string that containts a <select> tag with options. i want to take one of the options and make it checked and get the string back of what the html would look like, NOT a dom object. how can i do this?
[11:03:07] <aendo> i don't want to manipulate the string directly so i though jquery would help me again here
[11:03:17] <phlp> NackNick: http://jsfiddle.net/mfggc/1
[11:04:11] <aendo> if i select the option and set its checked attr i already filtered out the other options and the select container to doing .html() doesnt work
[11:04:35] <NackNick> what was the problem phlp, if you dont mind telling me
[11:05:58] <phlp> the selector '#loancalculator .button' wasnt selecting anything (which could just be missing markup in the fiddle).. the var and parseInt are suggestions
[11:08:04] <NackNick> ohh ok, thank you
[11:11:33] <d4rklit3> beasty i dont datejs handles that
[11:11:38] <d4rklit3> err it does
[11:11:54] <d4rklit3> i just can't find how he does it on his home page.. looking for the specific format tags to put in ms
[11:11:55] <d4rklit3> :P
[11:14:47] <m0dmd> yo yo yo!!!!
[11:16:56] <coconutz> hey guys, i got a markup from a company , 70% of it its a divs and other have tbody and th etc... is it make sense? they say that is faster (and i also saw that drupal 6 uses in views this.... )
[11:17:54] <ryanneufed> fastest way to search an array of objects for one that has a specific value?
[11:20:40] <phlp> ?js $.inArray(3, [1,2,3,4,5])
[11:20:42] <bot-t> phlp: 2
[11:21:01] <systemfault> ryanneufed: None :/
[11:21:11] <systemfault> ryanneufed: You must do it manually.
[11:21:25] <ryanneufed> I just found $.grep
[11:21:34] <systemfault> Checking :P
[11:21:35] <snover> I guess phlp didnât just use inArray then
[11:21:42] <NackNick> i dont get this, the code works fine in jfiddler but when i try it somewhere else it doesnt, i even made a blank html file and added it all in and it still doesnt work
[11:21:52] <systemfault> snover: He said "object"
[11:22:41] <systemfault> ryanneufed: Thanks :D Didn't know about grep
[11:22:42] <Pierro> someone know how to do a preloading page for jquerymobile?
[11:22:44] <ravenzz> http://phpjs.org/functions/in_array:432
[11:22:49] <systemfault> ryanneufed: Stupid name though :/
[11:22:54] <ryanneufed> not really
[11:22:58] <snover> ?eval var obj = {}, arr = [ 'foo', obj ]; $.inArray(obj, arr);
[11:22:59] <bot-t> snover: 1
[11:23:00] <ryanneufed> it does exactly what grep does
[11:23:20] <ravenzz> oh jQuery has its own inArray()
[11:23:25] <systemfault> ryanneufed: You can pass it regular expression? ;)
[11:23:29] <jaequery> whats the best way to cure FOC while loading different fonts?
[11:23:29] <snover> ravenzz: you were being ironic. right?
[11:23:34] <ryanneufed> systemfault: sure
[11:23:39] <ryanneufed> you can do anything you want
[11:23:41] <ravenzz> :D
[11:23:43] <ryanneufed> you pass it a function
[11:23:44] <systemfault> ryanneufed: Not really..
[11:23:55] <ryanneufed> and return true/false if it passes your regex
[11:24:01] <benwas> Hi everyone, can one of you tell me if its possible to lazy load Cufon?
[11:24:33] <ryanneufed> snover: that's great, but I don't know all the information about the object I'm looking for
[11:24:46] <jaequery> benwas: i think so
[11:24:51] <systemfault> ryanneufed: Seriously.. it has nothing to do with grep.. usually that function is called "filter"
[11:25:08] <systemfault> But I guess that jQuery uses that word for something else.
[11:25:16] <systemfault> So they came up with that dumb name.
[11:25:26] <jaequery> almost anything can be lazy loaded, with a few exceptions
[11:25:27] <benwas> jaequery: I tried doing it the old fashioned javascript way but i get a "Cufon not defined" error on my font script file
[11:25:33] <ryanneufed> systemfault: What is it that grep does?
[11:25:47] <ryanneufed> systemfault: does it not filter for your search terms?
[11:25:53] <ryanneufed> or your regexp?
[11:25:57] <jaequery> how did you lazy load it
[11:26:15] <benwas> var cufonYUI = document.createElement('script');
[11:26:15] <benwas> 			cufonYUI.setAttribute('src', 'js/libs/cufon-yui.js');
[11:26:15] <benwas> 			var cufonFont = document.createElement('script');
[11:26:15] <benwas> 			cufonFont.setAttribute('src', 'js/libs/League_Gothic_400.font.js');
[11:26:15] <benwas> 			document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(cufonYUI);
[11:26:15] <benwas> 			document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(cufonFont);
[11:26:37] <ryanneufed> systemfault: it has nothing to do with the grep command itself, but it does serve a similar purpose
[11:26:38] <t0th> hi
[11:26:42] <t0th> how i can use the next
[11:26:43] <systemfault> ryanneufed: Not at all.
[11:26:46] <t0th> with me not work
[11:26:52] <jaequery> you need a event handler like, labjs to check if cufon js has been loaded, and then execute your cufon code
[11:26:54] <ravenzz> ryanneufed you can use filter()
[11:27:01] <benwas> ahhh
[11:27:06] <systemfault> ryanneufed: I love you for teaching me that it exists but the name is stupid.
[11:27:14] <systemfault> ryanneufed: It's not your fault.
[11:27:21] <benwas> thanks jaequery
[11:27:32] <jaequery> np
[11:27:39] <ryanneufed> ravenzz: thanks, but filter is for elements, I'm not working with elements
[11:27:59] <ravenzz> .filter(function() { return $(this).val() == "foo" })
[11:28:05] <jaequery> i wish i knew how to lazy load a tinymce/wysiwygs
[11:28:19] <jaequery> i still couldn't figure out how to do that :(
[11:28:33] <jaequery> anyone?
[11:28:36] <ryanneufed> ravenzz: yes, but I'm working with an array of generic objects. It's okay, grep is perfect
[11:28:37] <systemfault> ravenzz: jQuery.grep exists because Array.filter doesn't work everywhere and that the normal jQuery.filter is for DOM
[11:28:38] <ravenzz> ryanneufed you can extend it to whatever you want
[11:28:48] <binni> anyone noticed that the jquery ui Redmond theme is a bit off in IE9? At least the datepicker and buttons.
[11:29:08] <ryanneufed> ravenzz: it's less work to use grep, and it does what the name implies
[11:29:15] <ravenzz> ok
[11:29:19] <ryanneufed> filter is great for working with dom elements
[11:29:23] <jaequery> i think jquery ui is sort of dead in it's own way
[11:29:41] <ryanneufed> which I am not doing at this point, so there is no need for wrapping my items in DOM elements
[11:29:45] <ravenzz> i didn't know grep since now
[11:29:50] <ryanneufed> thanks for trying to help though
[11:29:57] <ryanneufed> jaequery: it's far from dead
[11:30:22] <jaequery> i know but, thats why i said in it's own way ...
[11:30:48] <jaequery> think design can use an update
[11:30:53] <t0th_-> http://pastebin.com/9s9FFS3R
[11:30:56] <t0th_-> why return null?
[11:31:05] <t0th_-> i need return the html in transacoes_list
[11:31:07] <jaequery> that new tooltip looks interesting though
[11:31:50] <jaequery> i wish they had better docs too with example codes
[11:31:59] <jaequery> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip
[11:32:25] <t0th_-> any?
[11:33:21] <t0th_-> nobody?
[11:33:34] <phlp> t0th_-: works fine http://jsfiddle.net/yyteu
[11:36:17] <t0th_-> [phlp]: i have a $.get
[11:37:00] <t0th_-> http://jsfiddle.net/yyteu/1/
[11:38:30] <t0th_-> works
[11:38:31] <t0th_-> thanks
[11:38:38] <t0th_-> the this inside the get
[11:42:27] <SDr_> ajpiano
[11:43:07] <ajpiano> yes?
[11:43:16] <SDr_> would you mind going back in time to around 16:20, smacking me in the head, and pointing to droppable's refreshPositions option?
[11:43:35] <SDr_> I've digged through half of jqueryUI's source code, prepared to file a bug report
[11:43:38] <ajpiano> haha luckily for us, that's in the future for me.
[11:43:41] <SDr_> then spotted the option
[11:43:47] <SDr_> ...goddamnit.
[11:44:19] <eventualbuddha> is it possible to use .live() with the 'setData' event?
[11:45:56] <[algo]> eventualbuddha no
[11:47:31] <eventualbuddha> [algo]: okay, thanks
[11:47:47] <maxo> hi, I'm using .html() to change the contents of a div. but I've also got the css cursor: hand; on the div, but when its contents change and I hover above it, a hand no longer appears. Is this a bug or am I missing something?
[11:48:22] <[algo]> maxo: check it in Dev Tools
[11:48:31] <[algo]> probably the new context has it's own cursor
[11:48:36] <[algo]> there may be no other reason
[11:48:39] <Vaerros> maxo: pretty sure hand is not a valid value
[11:48:39] <maxo> [algo], what's dev tools?
[11:48:45] <[algo]> and cursor: pointer
[11:48:49] <d4rklit3> can somebody recommend some good string utils
[11:48:51] <[algo]> maxo: Firebug or kind of
[11:48:59] <d4rklit3> stuff that will truncate+add elipses etc
[11:48:59] <maxo> algo: but I've also tried setting .css("cursor", "hand") in jquery but it still doesn't fix it
[11:49:20] <maxo> ah yes it should be pointer
[11:49:20] <Vaerros> maxo: not a valid property
[11:49:37] <binni> where do I file a bug about jQuery UI button and datepicker rendering wrong in IE9?
[11:49:52] <binni> in a specific theme
[11:49:56] <binni> redmond
[11:50:15] <maxo> Vaerros, [algo], ok it's working now with pointer. but strange, initially on load it did work with 'hand'
[11:57:36] <vasuki> My js code is failing when I put it all in a function and then call it from $(document).ready. I can't find a function in my "new function". Any suggestions?

[12:20:57] <d4rklit3> ?
[12:23:32] <binni> d4rklit3: isn't canvas supported in IE9? And there are some ways to make canvas work in older IE browsers.
[12:23:46] <ryanneufed> d4rklit3: the answer to when it will be standard is at that link. It's a work in progress.
[12:24:07] <ryanneufed> d4rklit3: you should go to #html5 instead
[12:24:14] <ryanneufed> might get more help
[12:24:29] <ryanneufed> I know paulirish hangs in there from time to time

[12:29:48] <Hilikus> if i select the option and set its checked attr i already filtered out the other options and the select container to doing .html() doesnt work
[12:29:51] <mainiak> Hi. Can I use jQuery UI (1.8.13) with jQuery 1.6.1 or some issue exists?
[12:29:53] <e-anima> and for exaple add FOO at the end
[12:30:19] <khaan> hi everybody :)
[12:30:25] <Anitox> Hilikus, $('select#whatever').val("choose_this").parent().text();
[12:30:25] <Anitox> ?
[12:30:39] <Gates> Hello
[12:30:46] <gnarf> Hilikus: what version of jQuery
[12:30:50] <Gates> I have a php problem that can only be over come with JQuery/JS
[12:30:53] <Hilikus> gnarf latest
[12:31:10] <Hilikus> Anitox: i'll try that, but i think i tried parent() and it was empty
[12:31:27] <Gates> I have a php variable that in an include but it needs to show up after the include() for php, cant i just use JSON to set it in JQUERY? and output it at the top?
[12:31:35] <Gates> which i dont evne know how to do the jquery part :x
[12:32:16] <gnarf> Hilikus: http://stackoverflow.com/privileges
[12:32:17] <adatta02> hey guys does anyone know off hand if theres a known issue using this code on jquery 1.3 http://jsfiddle.net/dXWhp/4/
[12:32:29] <adatta02> or am I just doing something wrong - it works as expected on 1.5/1.6
[12:32:52] <Hilikus> Anitox, i can't select it from the document since it is not there yet. i have the html text in a string so i cant do $("#blah")
[12:33:11] <khaan> sorry for the n00b question, but is animateToClass compatible with the latest jQuery?
[12:33:22] <gnarf> khaan: animateToClass???
[12:33:26] <khaan> aha
[12:33:29] <Hilikus> gnarf: ??
[12:33:32] <gnarf> khaan: jQuery UI has animated classes
[12:33:39] <gnarf> Hilikus: oops sory, paste fail
[12:33:45] <khaan> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/animate-to-class
[12:33:46] <gnarf> Hilikus: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NmLck/1/
[12:33:56] <gnarf> khaan: use jQuery UI effects.core
[12:34:03] <gnarf> khaan: that will give you animateclass
[12:34:09] <khaan> can you guys give me a link?
[12:34:32] <khaan> (an EXAMPLE, imean :D )
[12:34:44] <khaan> i am trying to apply that to the height of a wordpress post
[12:35:07] <khaan> like in http://www.elegantthemes.com/preview/TheStyle/
[12:35:26] <Hilikus> gnarf: i see your trick. you put it in a dummy div
[12:35:30] <Hilikus> that should do it
[12:36:50] <mainiak> adatta02: http://jsfiddle.net/dXWhp/6/ - this works, what's the issue?
[12:37:47] <adatta02> mainiak, try http://jsfiddle.net/dXWhp/7/ - the expected second dialog is "true"
[12:37:49] <adatta02> but you'll get .toggle
[12:37:54] <adatta02> it works in newer versions
[12:38:45] <jeffsmykil> If I want to target a div.class inside of a div#id I can do that right?
[12:39:01] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: $("div#id div.class")
[12:39:09] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[12:39:11] <jeffsmykil> grarg
[12:39:49] <jeffsmykil> ty gnarf for confirming my suspicion
[12:40:49] <mainiak> adatta02: just tried - can't help :)
[12:41:41] <jeffsmykil> ugh firebug is saying this var isnt defined, but when i step through it it is
[12:41:46] <adatta02> mainiak, i think its a regression in 1.3 maybe - the API doesnt say anything about a change in how that works
[12:41:56] <mainiak> ok
[12:43:57] <khaan> guys, how can i make a div wide and tall as the whole screen when i click on it?
[12:44:29] <jeffsmykil> khaan the browser window or the whole screen>
[12:44:39] <khaan> the browser windo
[12:44:40] <khaan> w
[12:44:42] <khaan> :)
[12:45:11] <jeffsmykil> you can get the size of the browser window pretty easily and then pass it to the div's css using .css()
[12:45:35] <gnarf> $(window).width() / height() ?
[12:45:41] <phlp> adatta02: looks like it works with .click instead of .live if that helps
[12:45:51] <khaan> mmm checking TFM :)
[12:45:59] <khaan> i'm a total n00b
[12:46:00] <khaan> :)
[12:46:03] <khaan> so forgive me
[12:46:05] <adatta02> phlp, thanks - i just upgraded the jQuery version and I'm praying it doesn't break anything (smart I know)
[12:46:20] <jeffsmykil> khaan http://stackoverflow.com/questions/838137/jquery-change-height-based-on-browser-size-resize
[12:46:21] <gnarf> adatta02: what version from -> to on jQuery?
[12:46:22] <adatta02> 1.3 => 1.5 should be safe for the most part right?
[12:46:23] <jeffsmykil> that should help
[12:46:30] <gnarf> adatta02: 1.3??? omg
[12:46:37] <adatta02> haha yah the project is 2 years old
[12:46:39] <gnarf> adatta02: things to watch for...
[12:46:44] <khaan> jeffsmykil thx :D
[12:46:45] <gnarf> adatta02: [attrib="quoted"]
[12:46:53] <gnarf> ^^^ requres quotes as of 1.4.x
[12:47:12] <gnarf> 1.5 rewrote a lot of ajax stuff
[12:47:19] <gnarf> no huge breaks
[12:47:29] <adatta02> the AJAX interface is consistent though right?
[12:47:33] <gnarf> but you should probably just go ahead and advance to 1.6.1 and deal with it
[12:47:41] <gnarf> adatta02: it is MOSTLY backwards compat
[12:48:09] <adatta02> ha well good thing the client will get to find out what breaks
[12:48:23] <gnarf> 1.6.1 you should take a look at any use of .attr() and see if it should be .prop() instead
[12:48:47] <gnarf> a lot of them got "shimed" to be BC in 1.6.1 - but its still better to use prop if you meant to use prop
[12:48:54] <simenbrekken> Any channel for jQuery mobile specifically?
[12:49:02] <gnarf> simenbrekken: #jquerymobile
[12:49:07] <simenbrekken> gnarf: thanks
[12:52:57] <joeellis> Is there a good way to get jquery to reload an object that is cached, e.g.  var cache = $(".someobject") -> make a change to .someobject -> cache.reload()
[12:52:59] <joeellis> ?
[12:53:39] <mainiak> joellis: run the command again?
[12:54:02] <joeellis> mainiak: That's what I was doing, but was just curious if there was a less verbose way to do it
[12:54:14] <joeellis> outside of making my own function
[12:54:23] <mainiak> joellis: sorry  - don't know
[12:54:39] <joeellis> The selectors I'm using are unfortunately quite long
[12:54:41] <orolo> i need to wrap all of the <li>'s in a div after <li class="foo">. anyone?
[12:55:54] <Hilikus> thanks gnarf. it worked
[12:56:11] <gnarf> Hilikus: np
[12:56:34] <Hilikus> the problem was parent() was returning all the options and parent.parent was returning undefined, but i put it in a dummy div and now parent.parent returns <select>
[12:57:31] <bdone> hey guys
[12:59:25] <bdone> my hands are tied using 1.2.6 and i need some help traversing a <ul> tree based on anchor selector in their <li>

[13:02:48] <khaan> can anyone help me to debug this function?
[13:02:57] <Anitox> dankest, check for key code 13, which is the return key
[13:03:02] <khaan> ideally it should enlarge a div to a full browser width when clicking

[13:12:27] <khaan> i see
[13:12:27] <foxhoundz> phlp: There's still pastebin o.0
[13:12:35] <khaan> in fact i was using pastebin :)
[13:13:02] <foxhoundz> !help
[13:13:10] <foxhoundz> hmm...
[13:13:11] <ravenzz> uh it is down

[13:13:41] <khaan> shouldn't be hard for you gentlemen :)
[13:14:30] <foxhoundz> how about .click()
[13:14:41] <khaan> foxhoundz: i tried :)
[13:14:49] <khaan> but i'm SO ignorant :)
[13:14:59] <ravenzz> then read about click()
[13:14:59] <ravenzz> !?

[13:15:30] <khaan> but i was trying something like jQuery("#list li").click(function(){resizeFrame();}
[13:15:38] <khaan> but somehow it's not working...
[13:15:49] <foxhoundz> Are you trolling? D:
[13:16:16] <ravenzz> khaan you miss an );
[13:16:30] <ravenzz> jQuery("#list li").click(function(){resizeFrame();});

[13:18:22] <khaan> trying, thx :)
[13:19:44] <khaan> btw i'm working on a live example, so i think that webdevout is less useful than the other link
[13:20:36] <ravenzz> i would test, mabye make a little correction/try

[13:21:23] <khaan> :)
[13:21:24] <mainiak> Could I really have some problems when using latest jQuery with (latest) jQuery UI?
[13:23:12] <ryanneufed> mainiak: doubtful
[13:23:41] <ryanneufed> mainiak: the jquery ui guys dev against latest jquery and I believe they test against older versions too
[13:24:34] <mainiak> ryanneeufed: I just wanted to hear it from somebody else - because it seems like miss-interpretation
[13:24:39] <mainiak> ryanneufed, thanks
[13:24:59] <ryanneufed> mainiak: I have a site with 1.3 JQ and 1.8 Ui
[13:25:02] <ryanneufed> works fine
[13:25:34] <mainiak> ok
[13:26:01] <mainiak> I just wanted to be sure - I like latest stable everything :)
[13:27:08] <d4rklit3> um so is jsfiddle just gone now?
[13:27:15] <d4rklit3> crashed?
[13:27:49] <NiX7859Waterwolf> seems like it, doesn't work for me
[13:27:55] <ryanneufed> say it ain't so...
[13:31:45] <NackNick> is jsfiddle down for anyone?
[13:31:56] <d4rklit3> yes
[13:32:02] <d4rklit3> it is

[13:33:18] <m0dmd> Who is sandbagging jsfiddle!
[13:37:08] <bittyx-laptop> is it considered resource-heavy (as in CPU/memory) to use a lot of .live() bindings on a single page? i'm asking because i'm not sure how .live() works "under the hood", and whether following the existence of a lot of elements on a page can be intensive. (the alternative would be, of course, to automatically (re)bind events every time i *know* that something's going to change in the DOM)
[13:37:30] <dtach> can i actually remove <a> from itself? like unwrap, so just end up with the text inside <a>sometext</a> ?
[13:37:34] <d4rklit3> im looking to make a grid
[13:37:47] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: .delegate is better.
[13:37:48] <d4rklit3> however, $.each only gives me i
[13:38:19] <d4rklit3> where as to make this grid in order i would need 2 iterators,
[13:38:26] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: however, having many .live handlers is better than having an equal amount of .bind/.click/etc
[13:38:27] <d4rklit3> so $.each isn't going to work here right
[13:39:41] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: hmm, really? i was under the impression that calling .bind() on document.ready or something would just execute/bind them that one time, and that's it, whereas, using .live() would have to check if there are new elements in the DOM that match the selector, that don't already have the event bound
[13:40:00] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: or is it "better" in some other sense?
[13:40:38] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: $("#foo").live("click",fn) is basically the same as $(document).bind("click", function(e){   if($(e.target).is("#foo"){}  )    })
[13:41:46] <norm2782> hi all, I'm running into an issue with jquery-ui's draggable. the dragged div is offset from the mouse position when I drag in a scrolled window
[13:41:57] <norm2782> setting refreshPositions doesn't solve it
[13:42:09] <norm2782> does anyone know how to fix it ?
[13:42:29] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: ah, i see. hmm, but would using .live() for an event like "mouseover" be heavy? also, is the difference between .live() and .delegate() only in the propagation?
[13:42:35] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: .live exploits the fact that if you click an anchor inside a div, you can catch the click by looking at the anchor OR the div
[13:43:42] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: live and delegate do the same thing, but .delegate sets the scope to the selector, while live sets the scope of the document
[13:43:47] <bittyx-laptop> yeah, i understand. so using .bind() for a lot of elements would make a bunch of different event bindings (for each of the elements), while .live() would basically only bind an event for the document, and check the matching target to see which function should execute?
[13:43:48] <dabear> ?source delegate:
[13:43:49] <bot-t> Line#3061 - "delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#3061
[13:44:53] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: here is the source for the delegate function:
[13:45:24] <bittyx-laptop> i can't open the bot-t.com link
[13:45:32] <dabear> delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) { return this.live( types, data, fn, selector );
[13:45:37] <dabear> bot-t is down
[13:45:57] <dabear> but the one liner above is the implementation of it

[13:47:39] <littulb> Hey guys... whats the syntax for checking to see if a sing DIV (out of a set of divs) contains an object with the id "foo" ??

[13:48:17] <dabear> ?is @ littulb

[13:49:42] <letterpress> when a hashchange event fires, is there any way to detect whether this was because of the back button?
[13:50:06] <letterpress> ...versus for instance someone manually changing the hash in the url bar?
[13:50:25] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: hmm, i'm not sure i understand the difference in the scope of .delegate() and .live() - do you mean to say that (this) will refer to different elements when used in the bound functions?
[13:50:43] <dabear> nope
[13:50:57] <nicetry> Hey guys, what can you recommend for the best way to do a youtube video played in a lightbox-type container?
[13:51:15] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: google for event bubbling
[13:51:20] <littulb> bot-t.... i think thats exactly what i need. Thanks bro!!!
[13:51:28] <m0dmd> nicetry tons of examples from google.
[13:51:39] <dabear> .live and .delegate explit event bubbling, bittyx-laptop
[13:51:41] <m0dmd> nicetry you could try fancybox
[13:51:51] <dabear> littulb: dude, look at the name. bot-t..
[13:51:56] <dabear> bot-t: are you a bot?
[13:51:57] <bot-t> dabear, Outlook good.
[13:51:57] <nicetry> m0dmd: I know, thats why I came here to ask. I was wondering what you've tried and whats worked/what hasn't
[13:51:58] <m0dmd> nicetry or you can make your own div and load in embed code via ajax
[13:51:59] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: okay, i'll read about it. thanks for the info!
[13:52:14] <nicetry> whats good for size/load time...etc...
[13:52:28] <m0dmd> well your video will always load externally since it's youtube.
[13:52:53] <nicetry> m0dmd: for now yes, but at some point we'll serve it, this is only in the meantime
[13:53:20] <m0dmd> you mean, you want to host your own videos or use youtube videos
[13:53:28] <m0dmd> which one.
[13:53:44] <m0dmd> and your question was about loading youtube videos in lightbox type containers
[13:53:50] <nicetry> m0dmd: right now I'm looking for a solution that works with youtube, at a later point I will be hosting it myself.
[13:54:05] <m0dmd> nicetry http://webdesignandsuch.com/posts/fancybox-youtube/
[13:54:12] <ravenzz> you can write your tiny lightbox in 60secs
[13:54:22] <masondesu> letterpress: it might worth looking through some of the source from Ben Alman's http://github.com/cowboy/jquery-hashchange/tree/v1.3 to find out
[13:54:25] <m0dmd> nicetry at that later point, you'll need to learn about servers and more technology
[13:54:59] <m0dmd> ravens I think if he were able to do that, he's know how to do it :p
[13:55:06] <nicetry> that last point was very insightful m0dmd
[13:55:08] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: look at it like this, $("#foo").delegate("div", "click", function(){ /* do something*/ }  ) is the same as $("#foo").bind("click", function(e){     if($(e.target).is("div")){  /* do something*/}      } )
[13:55:18] <dankest> How do I prevent a form from responding to the return key?
[13:55:19] <dabear> now read that and understand it
[13:55:45] <ravenzz> m0dmd that's not really an hard exercise
[13:55:50] <bakers> dankest: test for it on keydown, if you see it return false
[13:55:57] <ravenzz> if you play with html/css/jquery
[13:56:03] <m0dmd> nicetry it is also easy for you to code a hidden div and load the video from youtube, but you'd need to learn jQuery a little bit more.
[13:56:20] <m0dmd> ravenzz not everyone is capable of playing with code :)
[13:56:26] <m0dmd> well not our batch that's for sure.
[13:56:36] <ravenzz> i mean i you are able to setup a video streaming server..uhm you can use google as well
[13:56:37] <ravenzz> lol
[13:56:41] <m0dmd> I eat code like a cookie monsta!
[13:56:56] <ravenzz> if*
[13:57:08] <m0dmd> I need a paying project like asap
[13:57:20] <m0dmd> but tired of competing with indians
[13:58:56] <ravenzz> you could complete my wp-plugin/website and get the 30% of ads revenue
[14:00:20] <m0dmd> That will take months
[14:00:30] <m0dmd> to start getting dollars
[14:00:32] <m0dmd> right?
[14:00:42] <ravenzz> at least 2
[14:00:48] <m0dmd> shoot me a pm rave
[14:00:53] <m0dmd> when you get the chance.
[14:01:25] <ravenzz> yep actually i am freezed due to ordinary work
[14:01:30] <d4rklit3> why is $.each better than for?
[14:03:16] <m0dmd> I think the use case matters d4rklit3
[14:03:36] <d4rklit3> i can't see how each can be used to create a grid
[14:04:33] <d4rklit3> since each only gives you one iterator
[14:04:59] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: ah, i see, i was under the wrong impression on how .delegate() is called. so basically, events bound by .live() propagate throughout the DOM tree (to the root), while those bound by .delegate() are limited to just a part of the DOM?
[14:06:26] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: no, all events propagate up to <body>, then <html>, then document, then window.
[14:06:42] <dabear> however, delegate attached a listener to a near parent,  while .live attaches that same listener to the window
[14:07:29] <dabear> .bind/.click however, attaches the event to the element it self
[14:09:18] <chrispercol> hi, I would like to click on a table cell and change the value of an input using a corresponding index...here's an attempt that prodices some strange results...has anyone a better suggestion? http://pastebin.com/UCapq7dc
[14:09:39] <d4rklit3> i am looking for a solid string utils lib
[14:12:35] <bittyx-laptop> hmm, so if i were to do something like $('#foo').delegate('a', 'click', function() { /* A */ } ); and $('#foo a').live('click', function() { /* B */ } ); A would execute before B?

[14:14:46] <SkyFlyer> is there a way to avoid the <a href="#" id="link">link</a> and when I click on it, it shows the # at the top even though it's bind to an event?
[14:14:59] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=TEPRBagX
[14:15:16] <bittyx-laptop> SkyFlyer: .preventDefault() ?
[14:15:49] <SkyFlyer> looks like maybe a return false;
[14:15:50] <SkyFlyer> ?
[14:16:09] <chrispercol> phlp:that's excellent, much appreciated :-)
[14:17:08] <bittyx-laptop> SkyFlyer: you probably want .preventDefault(), and not return false. see this: http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[14:17:10] <theunderstander> Its better to pass the object into your click event and preventDefault like skyflyer said
[14:17:12] <theunderstander> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[14:18:30] <SkyFlyer> yeah, that looks like it! cool thanks
[14:18:51] <d4rklit3> does js take literal regexp?
[14:18:54] <SkyFlyer> any simple way to change status on the hover? or just have to bind that seperatly ?

[14:22:25] <ryanneufed> d4rklit3: that's how you use bot-t
[14:22:31] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: delegate is implementet on top of live. besides, read the source if you want the details.
[14:22:42] <nguyendh> if i have a CJuiDatePicker field, i use jquery to make a clone , then append to the end of current form, The calendar does not show up because datepick attached to an id. any work around this ?
[14:22:49] <ryanneufed> d4rklit3: do you know how to use the javascript console in your browser(s)?'
[14:23:09] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: live in turn, is implementet as with $(window).bind()
[14:23:53] <rgbworld> Can I ask a jqueryui question here? I'm a newbe to irc
[14:24:02] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: yeah, i think i'll have to read the source in more detail to understand it better. thanks for your help and patience!
[14:24:40] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: .live is .bind, and since .delegate is .live, .delegate is also .bind
[14:24:57] <ryanneufed> ?live
[14:24:58] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[14:25:04] <ryanneufed> ?bind
[14:25:04] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[14:25:08] <ryanneufed> ?delegate
[14:25:08] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:26:14] <littulb> hey guys... what does the $ sign in front of a variable mean??
[14:26:51] <bittyx-laptop> littulb: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[14:28:33] <grid_> i use jquery .load() to adjust the content of my page dynamically, this works, however the source code of the page will not change, i know a page where the source code also will be changed, for example you select elements of the graphics and you hit a link and the page will change but will not reload, even the source code will be changed, where i'm looking at? it is no iframe
[14:29:05] <gnarf> littulb: nothing... most people use $variable as a way of stating the variable contains a jQuery object
[14:29:40] <bittyx-laptop> littulb: oh, sorry, i misunderstood your question. yeah, what gnarf said.
[14:30:07] <grid_> it is possible a javascript that will handle it in the background, but i'm looking for a better explanation
[14:30:17] <grid_> who could tell me?
[14:30:25] <gnarf> littulb: but that is just a naming convention, the $ has no special meaning in a JavaScript variable name
[14:30:49] <d4rklit3> could i put regexp into .replace() ?
[14:30:52] <d4rklit3> in js?
[14:30:57] <rgbworld> I need cellrender callback for jqueryui datepicker. Does this functionality exist?
[14:30:59] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: see this please: http://jsfiddle.net/bgjh2/
[14:31:03] <dabear> they are all the same
[14:31:18] <littulb> gnarf.. thanks - i noticed that with the $ sign in front of the variable allows that variable to be used as an object
[14:31:20] <kojiro> d4rklit3: yes
[14:31:23] <gnarf> ?js "test".replace(/[es]/g, "yup!"); @d4rklit3
[14:31:24] <bot-t> d4rklit3: "tyup!yup!t"
[14:31:54] <d4rklit3> cool
[14:31:54] <d4rklit3> thanks
[14:32:33] <dabear> littulb:
[14:32:35] <gnarf> littulb: pretty much everything in JavaScript is an object
[14:32:58] <dabear> littulb: $ does not change anything, with or without the variable can be used as an object
[14:33:10] <littulb> this is a snippet of my code http://jsfiddle.net/littulb/xw7e8/9/
[14:34:13] <dabear> ?jquery.contains @ littulb
[14:34:14] <bot-t> littulb, jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM node is within another DOM node. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[14:34:19] <littulb> im trying to get jquery to run the alert based on which Set (.set1 or .set2) contains the div with id=error
[14:34:25] <dabear> ?jquery.contains @ littulb
[14:34:26] <bot-t> littulb, jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM node is within another DOM node. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[14:34:55] <ryanneufed> littulb: you need to include jquery, not moot tools
[14:34:57] <ryanneufed> littulb: http://jsfiddle.net/xw7e8/10/
[14:35:15] <ryanneufed> littulb: and what dabear said
[14:36:01] <SkyFlyer> this seems to prevent the click from even happening...  event.preventDefault(); ? ?
[14:36:06] <d4rklit3> ?js eval(/[^\s]/.test("hello fools".charAt(7)))
[14:36:06] <bot-t> d4rklit3: true
[14:36:09] <d4rklit3> sweet
[14:36:11] <Azania> with jqueryUI draggable, is there anyway set a like area in which it can be dragged? cause atm it can be dragged all over the screen
[14:36:13] <littulb> ryanneufed .... hahahahahah WOW i did that huh!!!
[14:36:35] <necromancer> SkyFlyer: that is what it does. preventDefault() is generic though, it works on .submit() (prevents submitting a form) too
[14:36:36] <ryanneufed> littulb: yeah, that was the first problem :P
[14:36:38] <d4rklit3> ?js  "test your mom".replace(/\s+$/, '')
[14:36:38] <gnarf> d4rklit3: eval?
[14:36:38] <bot-t> d4rklit3: "test your mom"
[14:36:54] <dabear> littulb: http://jsfiddle.net/xw7e8/14/
[14:36:59] <bittyx-laptop> dabear: http://jsfiddle.net/sm5RG/ <--- so these two are equivalent as well? then i'm just not sure how .delegate() is implemented via .live(), since .live() is implemented via $(window).bind(), but i guess that's something i could find out by actually reading through the source code.
[14:37:06] <gnarf> d4rklit3: p.s. you can /msg bot-t your js tests ;)
[14:37:07] <d4rklit3> err wait wtf is /\s=$/
[14:37:10] <d4rklit3> oo ok
[14:37:12] <d4rklit3> cool thanks gna
[14:37:16] <d4rklit3> gnarf
[14:37:22] <gnarf> d4rklit3: \s = whitespace + = 1 or more, $ = end of string
[14:37:33] <SkyFlyer> well, i have a simple alert i'm trying to do so i have the bind click action and event.preventDefault(); and it wont do the alert.
[14:37:39] <gnarf> ?js "testing d4rklit3's mom    ".replace(/\s+$/, '')
[14:37:40] <bot-t> gnarf: "testing d4rklit3's mom"
[14:38:22] <gnarf> d4rklit3: its trim, for the end of the string only
[14:38:26] <dabear> bittyx-laptop: yes, they are the same, however, "this.context" is set to different values
[14:38:27] <d4rklit3> yep
[14:38:35] <d4rklit3> im converting some as3 classes to js
[14:38:40] <littulb> dabear...very smart method bro. Thanks!!!!!! Its a go!
[14:38:41] <d4rklit3> im not too good w/ regexp tho
[14:39:02] <littulb> i appreciate the help everybody....off to code i go
[14:39:50] <d4rklit3> i should convert gskinners string utils class from as3 to js.. its pretty bad ass
[14:40:20] <AfroTurf> i have <p><span></span></p>.. $("p").not("span").click() how do i get click to fire only if i'm outside of span?
[14:40:25] <d4rklit3> http://gskinner.com/blog/archives/2007/04/free_extension.html
[14:41:14] <gnarf> AfroTurf: harder than you might think
[14:41:23] <gnarf> AfroTurf: does the span have other children?
[14:41:29] <AfroTurf> yes
[14:42:04] <gnarf> $("p span").click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation() ; }); $("p").click(function() { alert("Not in a span!!!"); });
[14:42:20] <gnarf> AfroTurf: ^^^ thats how i would handle it then
[14:42:25] <AfroTurf> ok
[14:42:37] <AfroTurf> but $("p *") rather?
[14:42:47] <gnarf> no?
[14:42:53] <gnarf> what were you adding the * to?
[14:43:22] <gnarf> you are binding the click to the outer "p" -- and then binding another click on "p span
[14:43:33] <AfroTurf> oh i see
[14:43:37] <phlp> there's also this http://api.jquery.com/event.target
[14:43:38] <gnarf> that second one is stopping the propagation, so the click on the outer "p" doesn't fire
[14:43:53] <gnarf> phlp: that suggestion works well if you just have like one thing to stop
[14:44:05] <gnarf> like !$(e.target).is("a")
[14:44:15] <AfroTurf> i need the outer p to fire and the stuff inside span not to fire
[14:44:18] <gnarf> but stopping propagation is actually a little easier to read
[14:44:29] <gnarf> AfroTurf: stop propagation on "p span" and still bind to "p"
[14:44:31] <gnarf> it works
[14:44:39] <AfroTurf> gnarf: ok
[14:44:57] <AfroTurf> giving it a go
[14:45:49] <gnarf> AfroTurf: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/aeD4C/
[14:46:31] <gnarf> nice... http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/
[14:46:50] <AfroTurf> gnarf: brilliant!!
[14:46:57] <AfroTurf> gnarf: thanks!

[15:13:40] <nguyendh> is it a way to tell how long it takes a jquery script to execute ?
[15:14:08] <gnarf> nguyendh: timeline in chrome inspector?
[15:14:26] <nguyendh> gnarf, how do i get there ?
[15:14:38] <grid_> gnarf: can you help me with the question?
[15:14:56] <nguyendh> gnarf, nvm , i got it, but the timelines doesnt run
[15:14:59] <gnarf> grid_: i didn't understand it ;)
[15:15:03] <gnarf> nguyendh: record timeline
[15:15:08] <grid_> gnarf: ok :)
[15:15:09] <gnarf> nguyendh: and refresh?
[15:15:28] <nguyendh> thx, never use this b4. thx for pointing out
[15:16:16] <gnarf> nguyendh: np -- check out paul_irish's blog for a great video for chrome inspector win

[15:17:18] <GoGoGarrett> I'm having an issue with a few scripts here http://jsfiddle.net/Mt58s/   If I do just the JSON they work, but if i try to do the slideshow in as well, neither work.  I tried separating them both into their own functions and then calling both of the functions but this isn't working either. Any ideas?
[15:17:33] <nguyendh> hmm.maybe someone cn help me explain how thing get slower
[15:17:37] <nguyendh> i have a Form
[15:18:09] <nguyendh> what i did is make a clone of the form, rename some of the name/id in <input> field, then append the cloned form to the end of original form
[15:18:51] <nguyendh> 1st time, it took 1.49 sec, 2nd time took 5s, 3rd time took 9s
[15:20:06] <SmearCampaign> Can we see the code you are using for this?
[15:20:54] <gnarf> ?p @nguyendh
[15:20:55] <bot-t> nguyendh, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[15:21:14] <nguyendh> pastebin good ?
[15:21:49] <nguyendh> http://pastebin.com/vUP7Dmtg
[15:22:06] <nguyendh> it appears to me that the last line  -> $('.smallForm').last().after(sForm); is the culprit
[15:23:33] <nguyendh> when i took the last line (doing the append), it ran 36 ms each time
[15:25:45] <GoGoGarrett> Anyone have any ideas?
[15:26:08] <SmearCampaign> It's definitely getting bogged down running the selectors
[15:26:26] <SmearCampaign> since the amount of the dom tree it has to walk gets bigger every time
[15:26:40] <SmearCampaign> but I'm not sure how to rewrite the selectors in a faster way
[15:27:36] <SmearCampaign> Can you do an append to the parent of the small forms?
[15:27:47] <SmearCampaign> Wondering if that would be faster
[15:27:49] <nguyendh> i guess i could
[15:27:56] <nguyendh> will play around, thx for inputs guys
[15:28:27] <gnarf> nguyendh: use a #id after the last .smallForm and do a .before() instead of .after()
[15:28:46] <gnarf> fastest selector is generally #id
[15:29:21] <SmearCampaign> That would be faster just because it wouldn't have to generate a collection of elements and then find the last one, yeah
[15:29:38] <gnarf> SmearCampaign: that and it can use getElementById
[15:29:56] <SmearCampaign> right.
[15:30:29] <devinrolsen> Can anyone tell me why $.each is console logging out my full url's diffrent parts (event though I and removed the first half of my url string)? And how to remove these empty strings from the $.each values?
[15:30:31] <devinrolsen> http://jsfiddle.net/ctGzm/
[15:30:50] <nguyendh> thanks guys
[15:31:50] <devinrolsen> opps, missplaced the 'global' replace g in my expression, updated version http://jsfiddle.net/ctGzm/1/
[15:32:39] <devinrolsen> still is console logging empty strings, any clue to to remove them other than doing a .replace(/ /g,''); to my long string var?
[15:35:55] <devinrolsen> nm, got it.
[15:43:17] <aleray_> hi, i'm writing a jquery plugin and I'd would like people to be able to attach functions to hooks like 'post_init' is there any example of how to do this?
[15:44:49] <ch3mical> Just google "javascript custom events"
[15:45:02] <ch3mical> There are a ton of resources
[15:48:13] <aleray_> ch3mical, thanks
[15:48:16] <dingomanatee> any good libraries in jquery for network diagrams? Not nec. computer networks - could be social etc.
[15:48:16] <aleray_> i look into it
[15:58:51] <GoGoGarrett> I'm having a conflict where my slider will work, or my twitter feed will work, but not when I try to get them to work together.  I am assuming it is the way i'm calling them, but I don't know how to fix it.  If you have any refrences I can read or soluteions i'd greatly appreciate it.

[16:09:38] <d4rklit3> already do
[16:09:39] <d4rklit3> cheif
[16:09:51] <ryanneufed> d4rklit3: most of the questions you've asked could have been answered by trying it
[16:09:55] <ryanneufed> in the console
[16:09:58] <d4rklit3> yes.. i realise this and im sorry
[16:10:23] <ryanneufed> No need to be sorry. I'm just trying to point you in a direction that will make you more independent
[16:11:10] <m0dmd> ryanneufed if we can only teach some people how to be like us!
[16:11:17] <m0dmd> d4rklit3 is a good candidate though :)
[16:11:38] <d4rklit3> im not sure i want to be like u guys
[16:11:39] <m0dmd> d4rklit3 remember, any question you have, just try it :) start fromt he basics though.
[16:11:52] <m0dmd> well we definitely don't want to be like you :p
[16:11:55] <KWhat_Work> where is the div > a  selector defined ?
[16:11:56] <d4rklit3> im slightly taken aback by all his javascript stuff
[16:12:05] <m0dmd> whatcha need help with d4rklit3
[16:12:09] <d4rklit3> nothin atm
[16:12:15] <d4rklit3> like i get it :)
[16:12:19] <ryanneufed> KWhat_Work: what do you mean?
[16:12:46] <ryanneufed> KWhat_Work: the rules for the selectors are found in the sizzle portion of jQuery
[16:12:55] <d4rklit3> i just don't think i like it, however, i do like getting paid, and even more than that my ability to get paid consistantly (aka job security). This is where knowing this stuff comes in handy
[16:12:56] <ryanneufed> KWhat_Work: based on css selectors
[16:13:14] <KWhat_Work> ryanneufed: I fond the page, thanks.  Trying to figure out why what I have isnt doing what i think
[16:13:22] <ryanneufed> d4rklit3: I hated JS when I first started with it
[16:13:27] <ryanneufed> now I love it
[16:13:29] <d4rklit3> let me ask this, any flash developers turned rogue in here?
[16:14:36] <KWhat_Work> ryanneufed: so if i select div > a it returns the A right ?
[16:14:52] <ryanneufed> if a is inside the div yes
[16:15:11] <ryanneufed> but I would use $('div').find('a') as it's faster
[16:16:21] <ajpiano> those aren't logically equivalent :p
[16:17:14] <ryanneufed> no, they aren't, but I'm guessing that it will work for him anyway
[16:17:45] <KWhat_Work> im getting the event on an anchor tag that is inside a list item tag and I would like to located the 'next()' anchor in a LI
[16:18:15] <andoresu> hi
[16:18:18] <KWhat_Work> so i am guessing I would probably need to do a parent then child then next or something like that
[16:18:43] <ryanneufeld> what is it that you're attempting to accomplish ?
[16:19:04] <KWhat_Work> find the next item in a jquery-ui menu
[16:19:10] <KWhat_Work> for 1.9m5
[16:19:50] <andoresu> im using "draggable" and "droppable" but I need to take information of the dropped element, how can I get it?
[16:20:09] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I think you'd be better at answering his question
[16:21:08] <d4rklit3> hey javascript does things line by line right
[16:21:13] <d4rklit3> in terms of compiling the code
[16:21:29] <ryanneufeld> not exactly
[16:21:31] <tbranyen> d4rklit3: opposed to what?
[16:21:42] <d4rklit3> i dunno, i remember some shit in as2
[16:21:45] <ryanneufeld> it can be syncronous, or async
[16:21:55] <d4rklit3> well in a method, its synchronous
[16:22:15] <d4rklit3> like if a method runs a loop and populates an element, after that loop i should be able to grab taht elements height yes?
[16:22:20] <KWhat_Work> is there a good way to see what exactly i selected?
[16:22:39] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: they should have callbacks for when you click on something
[16:23:01] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3: in theory yes, unless you have an ajax call in there somewhere
[16:23:11] <d4rklit3> there is not
[16:23:14] <KWhat_Work> ryanneufeld: yah im in a callback, I ran a selector, and I am trying to figure out exactly what I got.  Just says [Object object]
[16:23:28] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: try console.dir()
[16:23:49] <ryanneufeld> pass it the object you're being passed back
[16:23:52] <KWhat_Work> yahhh FF4 for the win
[16:24:09] <KWhat_Work> mozilla programmers are still learning how to use pointers
[16:24:22] <ryanneufeld> crashed on you?

[16:24:32] <ryanneufeld> ?pe @d4rklit3
[16:24:33] <bot-t> d4rklit3, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[16:24:55] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: yeah, I hear that from my co-workers, i's a Pile O shite on OSX too
[16:24:57] <d4rklit3> its part of something bigger
[16:25:02] <d4rklit3> i'll figure it out

[16:27:45] <d4rklit3> what does it mean when firebug shoes elements that are grayed out
[16:27:49] <vasuki> Hey guys, what's the best way to debug a function undefined error? It works fine when calling my primary function (which contains the undefined fucntion) directly and not using document ready (if that makes sense..)
[16:28:14] <spyr00t> hi ppl, i need a little help, i am using 3 jquery scripts on my website, one by one the work perfect, but together i having some trouble
[16:28:19] <spyr00t> one of them is not loading
[16:28:23] <spyr00t> can someone help me ?
[16:28:33] <KWhat_Work> yah i dont think .next('li > a') is looking at the children for some reaosn
[16:29:24] <spyr00t> anyone alive ?
[16:29:28] <KWhat_Work> yah
[16:29:32] <m0dmd> d4rklit3 how is development coming along?
[16:29:50] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: details one at a time
[16:30:03] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work do you have any idea ? http://www.orogroup.net/cgi-bin/datacgi/database.cgi?file=oro&report=Product&pro=00003
[16:30:36] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work the image slider stays on a loading stage
[16:31:11] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: you have some errors
[16:31:22] <KWhat_Work> nivoSlider not a func
[16:31:53] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work check the url again, i am deleting third plug-in, and everything will be ok
[16:32:05] <KWhat_Work> dude
[16:32:10] <KWhat_Work> your loading jquery 2x ?
[16:32:31] <spyr00t> i deleted accordion plugin, now slider works
[16:32:48] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work sorry i couldn't catch your question
[16:33:10] <ajpiano> it's not
[16:33:10] <ajpiano> .next().find("a")
[16:33:10] <ajpiano> .next() filters the very next sibling by an expression
[16:33:10] <ajpiano> $(this).parent().next().children("a")
[16:33:10] <ajpiano> next("li > a") wil not traverse down from the next li and then find it's child
[16:33:10] <ajpiano> it will filter whatever next is by that expressoin
[16:33:14] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: your loading like 3 diff version of jquery
[16:33:40] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work you think one is enough ?
[16:33:48] <KWhat_Work> O_o
[16:33:55] <spyr00t> :)
[16:34:00] <spyr00t> let me check
[16:34:27] <KWhat_Work> your loading 1.3.2, 1.4.3 and 1.6 something
[16:34:40] <spyr00t> i must load the latest right ?
[16:34:47] <MistuhKurtz> YOU MUST
[16:34:51] <KWhat_Work> i would start there and dont load the others
[16:36:33] <KWhat_Work> lets say I do a .next('li > a');  If the next LI does not contain an anchor tag will it skip it or return something
[16:37:22] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work :(( same problem
[16:37:31] <ajpiano> it will return an empty jquery object, KWhat_Work
[16:37:50] <KWhat_Work> AHHH thats where im skrewing up
[16:38:07] <KWhat_Work> ajpiano: there a way to get the next li with a 'a' child
[16:38:23] <ajpiano> .nextAll("li:has(a)").first();
[16:39:02] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: im looking
[16:39:45] <spyr00t> oki
[16:40:41] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: $('#slider').nivoSlider(); needs to be in the onready
[16:40:45] <KWhat_Work> not on the window load
[16:41:00] <KWhat_Work> $(document).ready(function() {
[16:41:51] <KWhat_Work> just cause the window is done loading doesnt mean jquery ran
[16:42:16] <PhonicUK> hey all, is it possible to select elemets by ID with only a partial match on the ID?
[16:42:57] <jedimind> div[id^=something] that would match any div that begins with "something"
[16:43:00] <d4rklit3> im confused about how to inject css dynamically to an element
[16:43:08] <d4rklit3> i have something like this: $("#pages", {css: {'top' : 800+'px'}});
[16:43:11] <d4rklit3> but im not sure thats supposed to work
[16:43:18] <jedimind> its not
[16:43:41] <jedimind> $("#pages").css('top','800px');
[16:43:46] <d4rklit3> wtf
[16:43:51] <jedimind> you were WAAAAY off
[16:43:53] <jedimind> :)
[16:43:55] <d4rklit3> .css() docs explicetely say GET
[16:44:27] <d4rklit3> reading further however... nvm
[16:44:44] <jedimind> .css( propertyName, value ) Returns: jQuery
[16:44:44] <jedimind> Description: Set one or more CSS properties for the set of matched elements.
[16:44:45] <jedimind> :)
[16:44:51] <jedimind> Description: Set one or more CSS properties for the set of matched elements.
[16:44:57] <jedimind> sorry pasted that all fucke dup my bad
[16:45:22] <jaequery> wasn't there a javascript way to copy/text to clipboard?
[16:45:28] <jaequery> all i can see now is a flash solution
[16:45:29] <jaequery> wtf?
[16:45:38] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work same problem :(
[16:45:43] <jaequery> i feel like im having amnesia :(
[16:45:45] <jedimind> jaequery, there is no cross-browser / cross-platform standard for copying to clipboard
[16:45:46] <KWhat_Work> how many selectors can you chain together?  ie :first:selected ?
[16:46:01] <jedimind> so the only consistent method is flash unfortunately
[16:46:16] <jaequery> i remember all sites had a copy to clipboard way before flash method was introduced
[16:46:17] <jedimind> KWhat_Work, as many as you want, but if you're doing 30 you're probably doing something else wrong
[16:46:36] <jedimind> jaequery, it only ever used to work in IE/firefox with more and more browsers out there, there is no standard
[16:46:38] <KWhat_Work> jedimind: just 2
[16:46:39] <KWhat_Work> lol
[16:46:47] <jedimind> and even for IE/firefox; there were usually 2 methods to cover those 2
[16:46:53] <jedimind> and even then would not work in say FF on linux
[16:47:15] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: lookin
[16:47:19] <jedimind> thats why you dont see sites with that functionality any more.... that, and people learned to hit ctrl+c :)
[16:47:43] <jaequery> hm i c so basically it means, chrome doesn't support copy/clipboard
[16:48:35] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: my only guess at this point is the plugins messing something up... if you remove the slider does it work ?
[16:49:20] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work menu and accordion plugins work, when i remove accordion plug-in slider works..
[16:50:45] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: well why arnt u using juqery ui's accordion ?
[16:51:18] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work can you give me the url
[16:51:46] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: although i would probably blame the slider just at a glance
[16:51:46] <KWhat_Work> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[16:54:36] <spyr00t> KWhat_Work how can i install it ?
[16:55:31] <KWhat_Work> spyr00t: its in the docs, pretty much the same way as jquery but you need a css theme and a few images
[16:56:36] <jedimind> jaequery, its actually not what iw as getting at
[16:56:57] <jedimind> what i was trying to say was that every browser / platform does it differently, so yes you can do it but you'd have to browser sniff each browser and do their own seperate way of copying to clipboard
[16:57:10] <jedimind> and there are more browsers than just ie/ff/chrome
[16:57:15] <jedimind> :)
[16:58:06] <KWhat_Work> jedimind: most the other ones use webkit or gecko
[16:58:17] <KWhat_Work> safari seamonkey netscape etc
[17:09:11] <d4rklit3> can i get the height of an object if its height is not set in css?
[17:09:18] <d4rklit3> like if its css class has no height
[17:09:38] <djQuery> d4rklit3: see ?hieght
[17:09:39] <bot-t> d4rklit3, .height() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[17:10:33] <d4rklit3> i get 0
[17:10:36] <d4rklit3> always 0
[17:10:37] <d4rklit3> no matter what
[17:11:09] <d4rklit3> i think its because the element is positions absolutely, and so are teh elements inside it
[17:12:31] <ch3mical> That shouldn't matter, but I believe it's based on CSS
[17:13:21] <Tapsy> I'm trying to get the 'order total' from a form using jquery.  There are 3 items needed to get the order total.  I have 2 of them working.  It's simple A+B+C.  However, the 3rd item must be gotten by getting the length property of an array of selected objects.  The selected objects are coming from a serious of checkboxes, with each one checked, .50 cents it to be added to the total.  There are only 4 checkboxes.  Any ideas/suggestions/hi
[17:15:29] <ch3mical> $(':checked').length
[17:17:28] <jroes> is there another form-styling jquery plugin / script like uniform that is more popular?
[17:18:34] <d4rklit3> what does it mean when divs in firebug are grayed out
[17:19:10] <ryanseddon> usually means they're hidden
[17:22:47] <djQuery> jroes: would stylin the form just be css without anyneed for jquery?
[17:23:07] <jroes> djQuery: I think there are exceptions for certain form tags
[17:23:45] <djQuery> jroes: you mean something like an html5 shiv?
[17:24:12] <jroes> uniform lets you style checkboxes, dropdown, radio buttons, and file upload inputs
[17:24:30] <jroes> I'm not sure if that's supported in HTML5 yet, so yeah it may be a shim
[17:26:02] <jroes> I'm just getting weird toLowerCase errors that I can't catch a breakpoint on inside of jQuery
[17:26:15] <jroes> I think they are related to a browser bug
[17:29:19] <jaequery> does cross-domain requests work fine for modern browsers now without resorting to hacks like using flash?
[17:30:02] <ryanseddon> jaequery: yep, most good browser can do CORS just fine
[17:30:39] <jaequery> wow since when?
[17:30:46] <ryanseddon> 2009
[17:30:55] <ryanseddon> I don't really know but it's been aroud for a while
[17:30:59] <jaequery> crazzy
[17:31:01] <ryanseddon> http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/cross-site-xmlhttprequest-with-cors/
[17:31:22] <jaequery> im guessing ie8 still doesn't support it, yes?
[17:31:43] <ryanseddon> Yeah IE8 supoorts it
[17:31:50] <Tapsy> [20:26] <Tapsy> Hey I was wondering if you might able to help me out a wee bit?  I'm trying to get an 'order total' for a pizza form using jquery.  There are 3 numbers to total, 1st the pizza choice, 2nd the pizza size, 3rd the amount of extra toppings (.50 cents each). [20:27] <Tapsy> I have added the following to the function used to validate and then display the order total:  var extras = $("input[name=chkExtras]").length; [20:28] <Ta
[17:32:04] <ryanseddon> But they use XDomainRequest();
[17:32:27] <ryanseddon> ?p @ Tapsy
[17:32:27] <bot-t> Tapsy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[17:32:30] <jaequery> holy cow
[17:33:19] <ryanseddon> jQuery will do a cross domain call if the url being called has the header set
[17:34:07] <Tapsy> Sorry, pasting, will be back asap :/
[17:34:54] <ryanseddon> although jQuery doesn't have support for XDomainRequest just the spec version
[17:36:23] <hssd8_> hi
[17:36:27] <nafta> Hello, sorry for disturbing, I'm trying to get a jquery slideshow to work on my site, and so far it works very nice in all browsers BUT in IE7/8, if you guys could take a look, it would be wonderful, thanks a lot for your help. here is the link. http://pastebin.com/TKtCp47X
[17:39:21] <Tapsy> I've pasted the code into jsfiddle.net here:  http://jsfiddle.net/KPtuT/
[17:40:39] <Tapsy> I'm trying to get the order total by simply adding pizzaChoice + pizzaSize + pizzaToppings.  I have it working for the pizzaChoice + pizzaSize, however its the toppings that aren't adding correctly to the total.
[17:42:24] <Tapsy> ...added this to the jquery, getting closer to working:  $("input[name=chkExtras]:checked").length $("input[name=chkExtras]").Val() 1
[17:43:33] <necromancer> Tapsy: what is clientCode/PizzaCode.js?
[17:45:30] <necromancer> the fiddle does not work at all
[17:45:31] <ryanseddon> Tapsy: you're turning you price calulcation into a string hence why you're getting 110.25
[17:45:43] <necromancer> (on chrome)
[17:46:17] <ngharo> Tapsy: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/KPtuT/1/ working fiddle
[17:46:26] <Tapsy> Ryanseddon, do you mind if I pm you?  It's hard to follow things on this main page.
[17:46:43] <Tapsy> Ok thank-you ngharo, I'm reading it / testing it over right now.
[17:48:00] <ryanseddon> ngharo: your version still converts the price calculation toa string and gets the wrong price
[17:48:47] <Tapsy> Unfortunately its still results in an incorrect price ngharo.  At those prices, the pizza place will be closed b4 it even opens :)
[17:49:01] <ryanseddon> Tapsy: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanseddon/KPtuT/3/ that will calculate the correct price
[17:49:40] <Tapsy> Ok reading again...I truly appreciate this.  I've spent upwards of 7+ hours on the whole thing.  Yes I am very new to jquery.
[17:51:01] <ryanseddon> Javascript has type coercion, e.g if you do "hello" + 1 + 1000 it will return "hello11000"
[17:51:52] <ryanseddon> but if you do "hello" + (1+1000) = "hello1001", it will still return a string but do the calculation correctly
[17:52:20] <daleharvey> is there a way to attach arbitrary data to $.ajax calls?
[17:53:05] <daleharvey> I am using the deferred api and need to have some data in the promise that is particular to the request
[17:53:14] <d4rklit3> slowly but surely i feel myself slipping to the darkside of jquery
[17:53:23] <Tapsy> Extremely close to working.  I made an order that should have totalled $18 but instead it gave $19.  Um..it appears to give a $1 / amount of 1 , to each extra (topping).  This makes sense because the length of each extra topping is 1.  I just need to divide it by 2 so that each extra topping = .50 cents.
[17:54:50] <d4rklit3> Tapsy: is this a school project
[17:54:51] <d4rklit3> :P
[17:55:14] <ryanseddon> Tapsy: just divide extras by 2
[17:55:25] <ryanseddon> (extras/2 + total)
[17:55:32] <Tapsy>  dividing by 2 should be straight forward.  @d4rk no its not school yet.  I'm trying to self learn while saving for school.  :)
[17:56:45] <Tapsy> Ok its working thanks to the help.  To be specific, I did the divison as such:  var extras = $("input[name=chkExtras]:checked").length / 2;
[17:57:21] <Tapsy> Should I have done the division here instead or does it really make much difference:  alert(name + ": your order total is $" + (extras + total));
[18:10:08] <KingDosser> http://blackboarddev.com/mynt/mynt.html If you click on any of the tasks in the middle, a bar 'shows' from the left
[18:11:04] <KingDosser> Its actual positioning is on the right and I want it to to animate from behind the content (on the right)
[18:14:31] <RandalSchwartz> regarding the use of $ by jquery... am I misremembering that jquery *won't* clobber an existing $ (like from prototype.js)?
[18:14:33] <Joikus> hi you guys
[18:15:03] <Tapsy> If anyone has time, can you check the following jsFiddle posting.  What's expected to happen is when a user clicks on the 'extra toppings' checkbox, 4 other checkboxes appear, each with its own text & image.  That part is working, however when a user clicks on 1 of the 4 checkboxes, the image should become highlighted (red border).  As of now it only works somewhat with the first thumbnail.  Any ideas, clues, hints?
[18:15:06] <RandalSchwartz> I know about jQuery(function($){ ... }); as the ultimate "doc.ready" fun
[18:15:07] <RandalSchwartz> func
[18:15:49] <Joikus> say you have 2 checkboxes, <input type="checkbox" name="language" value="1"/> and <input type="checkbox" name="language" value="2"/>  --  How can I check them on page load, given this value, var languages = "1,2";
[18:16:11] <KingDosser> http://blackboarddev.com/mynt/mynt.html If you click on any of the tasks in the middle, a bar 'shows' from the left. Its actual positioning is on the right and I want it to to animate from behind the content (on the right)
[18:17:05] <RandalSchwartz> [random URL] this doesn't work right... can someone check it? I think it should [behavior wanted] but instead it sometimes [behavior observed]!
[18:17:25] <RandalSchwartz> and can someone look at [random pastebin] as well... it almost works, but I could use some advice.
[18:17:57] <Tapsy> @ RandalSchwartz:  jQuery provides the $.noConflict() utility function to relinquish control of the $ identifier to whatever other library might wish to use it. The syntax of this function is as follows:  Function syntax: $.noConflict
[18:20:15] <RandalSchwartz> is tapsy a bot, or just not paying attention? :)
[18:20:33] <Tapsy> No I'm human last time I checked (:
[18:20:55] <RandalSchwartz> ok - then my first question is still unanswered
[18:20:56] <Tapsy> I should inform you, I am no expert with jquery (:
[18:20:58] <RandalSchwartz> I know about .noConflict
[18:21:02] <tbranyen> RandalSchwartz: wat up
[18:21:08] <RandalSchwartz> but I think jq also is careful not to clobber $ if it exists
[18:21:18] <RandalSchwartz> so whether you load prototype first and jq second, or vice versa, everything still works
[18:21:19] <tbranyen> no it does, just keeps a reference to the original
[18:21:38] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - so .noConflict unwinds that?
[18:21:49] <Tapsy> Its far more likely you know more than me, with that being said, I would help if I could.  I'm new to this stuff :/
[18:22:02] <RandalSchwartz> ok - thanks... I think tbranyen's on the right track
[18:22:04] <tbranyen> yea
[18:23:20] <Tapsy> @ Randal ...mind checking out a jquery issue I'm having?  http://jsfiddle.net/KPtuT/4/
[18:23:58] <Tapsy> I'm sure its simple, however I can't wrap my brain around it
[18:26:15] <emuyser> jq, my love
[18:26:21] <ngharo> Tapsy: you can use ?siblings to grab a reference to the image
[18:26:22] <bot-t> Tapsy, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[18:26:31] <ngharo> apply your class to that
[18:27:50] <ngharo> $(this).siblings('img:first').toggleClass('selected');
[18:28:47] <Tapsy> Ok I'm testing it out ngharo, will be a wee bit of time.
[18:32:33] <asadpakistani> jquery 1.3.2 is getting stuck on delay but 1.6.2 is working fine..any ideas
[18:32:46] <RandalSchwartz> use 1.6.2! :)
[18:33:05] <Brodingo> delay was added 1.4
[18:33:12] <asadpakistani> RandalSchwartz: i am developing for drupal, so i have to use 1.3.2 that itself with an update module
[18:33:41] <asadpakistani> Brodingo: oohhh i seee, how do u pause in previous versions
[18:33:45] <RandalSchwartz> drupal doesn't work for 1.6.2?
[18:34:06] <asadpakistani> RandalSchwartz: no it comes with 1.2 and with a module u can get 1.3.2
[18:34:28] <Tapsy> @ngharo --I'd send you a case of beer if I could.  Thank-you my friend.  This channel rocks!  (:
[18:34:41] <asadpakistani> RandalSchwartz: even drupal 7 which is under development can be pushed up to 1.5.2 but thats about it
[18:34:57] <RandalSchwartz> ... Drupal 7 includes jQuery 1.4.4 and jQuery UI 1.8.7
[18:35:10] <RandalSchwartz> Yeah.  PHP.  Bleh.
[18:35:24] <asadpakistani> RandalSchwartz: its not php's fault lol
[18:35:42] <RandalSchwartz> the drupal developers selected PHP... so it's the fault of both of them
[18:35:45] <asadpakistani> RandalSchwartz: so anyway i can make my animation que wait after progressing
[18:36:03] <asadpakistani> RandalSchwartz: what do u use
[18:36:07] <asadpakistani> RandalSchwartz: dun tell me ruby :P

[18:42:38] <byomkeshbakshi> coldhead:http://jsfiddle.net/agZzE/
[18:42:42] <daleharvey> I have a list of urls and I want to check if they can be resolved
[18:43:02] <daleharvey> or, I want a list of the ones that do resolve (they dont return a 404)
[18:43:23] <Electissimi> or: http://jsfiddle.net/kVLCX/
[18:43:29] <daleharvey> the deferreds api seems to freak out once it sees a 404 though
[18:45:54] <coldhead> byomkeshbakshi: try commenting out your loadComplete function and instead paste that code into your firebug/dev tools console and see if it runs there
[18:45:54] <clem> My wish,when I hover <a>,the jquery code runs,it set <a> as this,then I use ($this>parent>parent a.foo).css("display", "none").
[18:45:56] <clem> How to achieve it in jquery?
[18:46:10] <byomkeshbakshi> ok
[18:46:28] <nafta> hello, I need some help with this, he slideshow works in EVERY browser...BUT in ie7/8, please if you guys could give me a hand I would really apreciate it, here it is -> http://pastebin.com/TKtCp47X
[18:46:42] <Electissimi> coldhead: were you able to take a look at my code?
[18:47:03] <coldhead> Electissimi: i can only do one thing at a time but i am looking now
[18:47:10] <matter> Hi everyone,
[18:47:12] * RandalSchwartz wanders off
[18:47:14] <coldhead> Electissimi: are you saying it works when you take out the call to fancybox?
[18:47:27] <Electissimi> coldhead: it doesn't pass the parameters from the form
[18:47:30] <coldhead> aw i missed randal, i love that guy
[18:47:31] <KingDosser> How (using jQuery) would I get like the  1st or 4th or 6th child of an element?
[18:47:37] <KingDosser> get = select *
[18:47:41] <coldhead> Electissimi: does it work when you take out the fancybox call?
[18:47:57] <coldhead> oh, the fancybox call shows the form?
[18:47:58] <ngharo> ?nth-child @ KingDosser
[18:47:59] <bot-t> KingDosser, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[18:48:03] <matter> I am working an an jquery animation..all is working good ! I am just looking for a way to preload the full animation before it start playing..is anyone know how to do that ?
[18:48:20] <Electissimi> coldhead: no the .fancybox call just loads an action gif
[18:48:36] <KingDosser> ngharo The element i want to select will be random (depending on what the user inputs)
[18:48:42] <KingDosser> and I only need to select one
[18:48:45] <coldhead> Electissimi: and if you take out the line to show the gif it still doesn't work?
[18:48:54] <Electissimi> coldhead: nope
[18:49:12] <KingDosser> ngharo: Would it work then to do :nth-child(n)
[18:49:34] <ngharo> KingDosser: yes, as the docs suggests
[18:50:12] <KingDosser> Cheers
[18:50:47] <ngharo> Electissimi: is the ajax call happening at all?
[18:51:18] <Electissimi> when i use chrome to check the network calls, it sends a POST to the file just the parameters aren't grabbing
[18:51:25] <asadpakistani> RandalSchwartz: i got it working with setTimeout...thanks
[18:52:05] <Electissimi> ngharo: yes
[18:52:27] <ngharo> what if you type $('#name') at the console, does it return what you expect?
[18:52:37] <coldhead> Electissimi: http://jsfiddle.net/kVLCX/2/
[18:52:53] <coldhead> the console shows the POST call with the correct data
[18:53:02] <coldhead> the callback doesn't fire because it's not successful
[18:53:10] <coldhead> but it sure sends the stuff
[18:53:43] <coldhead> i guess we lost byomkeshbakshi
[18:53:46] <Electissimi> coldhead: the alert works
[18:54:01] <coldhead> the alert that it was clicked works, not the callback alert
[18:54:04] <coldhead> not for me anyway
[18:54:13] <coldhead> but the post has the right data is what we care about anyway
[18:54:24] <coldhead> are you sure your HTML is right?
[18:54:28] <Electissimi> the console show no data being passed though
[18:54:28] <coldhead> you don't have duplicate IDs?
[18:54:48] <Electissimi> '#alert' has only one instance
[18:55:06] <coldhead> in the code i just pasted
[18:55:11] <coldhead> dont make me screenshot it
[18:55:14] <coldhead> so help me god
[18:55:19] <Electissimi> lmao, don't
[18:55:23] <coldhead> ngharo: can you verify i am not crazy?
[18:55:27] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/kVLCX/2/
[18:55:37] <coldhead> name and password in the POST request are being sent?
[18:55:40] <ngharo> yeah, it's posting correct
[18:55:43] <Electissimi> coldhead that code works
[18:55:43] <coldhead> yay!
[18:55:53] <coldhead> Electissimi: do you maybe have a signin form elsewhere on the page?
[18:55:59] <coldhead> with name and password fields?
[18:56:08] <coldhead> called #name and #password?
[18:56:13] <Electissimi> coldhead: yes, do you think that would stop it?
[18:56:19] <coldhead> yes!
[18:56:30] <coldhead> IDs must be uniqueu
[18:56:37] <Electissimi> lmao i didn't think it would show though, i have it hidden
[18:56:47] <asadpakistani> is there a way to change the timeout of a given setTimeout id once its been set?
[18:56:47] <Electissimi> let me try and see if i can fix that
[18:56:49] <coldhead> it happens on every project i bet :)
[18:57:23] <coldhead> asadpakistani: if you save the value returned by setTimeout you can can it and start a new one
[18:57:27] <coldhead> ?mdc cleartimeout
[18:57:28] <bot-t> coldhead, window.clearTimeout - MDC Docs - Clears the delay set by window.setTimeout() . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.clearTimeout
[18:57:41] <coldhead> can cancel it*
[18:57:43] <coldhead> jesus sorry
[18:59:38] <clem> <div><a>fas</a><div>,when I hover <a>,how can I get the parent <div> in jquery?
[19:00:12] <coldhead> $(this).parent() ?
[19:02:35] <Electissimi> coldhead: Thank you so much! it works great now
[19:03:26] <KingDosser> which_task = which_task[2];
[19:03:26] <KingDosser> which_task = which_task + 1;
[19:03:39] <KingDosser> If which_task initially = 1, why does it become 11 at the end?
[19:04:42] <ngharo> ?js '1' + '1'
[19:04:43] <bot-t> ngharo: "11"
[19:04:45] <ngharo> sounds like a string, not an integer
[19:05:06] <ngharo> ?mdc parseInt @ KingDosser
[19:05:06] <bot-t> KingDosser, parseInt - MDC Docs - Parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix or base. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[19:07:06] <KingDosser> Cheers, that works now
[19:08:46] <coldhead> good work Electissimi
[19:09:09] <coldhead> you;ve got another easy bugfix in your toolkit now
[19:09:39] <Electissimi> yeah lol, double check everything
[19:10:45] <coldhead> no, it's BEWARE DUPLICATE IDs!
[19:12:01] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/4hxcqg4np3m18vwv3jcw Can anyone see why that wont delete the element?
[19:13:45] <coldhead> i don't know, KingDosser
[19:13:56] <coldhead> have you tried a fadeOut() instead of remove?
[19:14:01] <coldhead> or something else visual like that?
[19:14:12] <coldhead> to see if jQuery has found your elem?
[19:14:13] <KingDosser> no i can give it a go
[19:14:34] <coldhead> another good trick is to alert or console.log $(selector_whatever).length
[19:14:41] <coldhead> that will show you how many elements it matched
[19:15:04] <KingDosser> Okay well it just hid the whole of #development ( the parent)
[19:15:23] <coldhead> ah you probably want a space before :
[19:15:50] <coldhead> you want the nth-child OF #development, not #development that is the nth-child
[19:16:02] <KingDosser> Wow lol one space screws that much
[19:16:18] <KingDosser> yay it works :)
[19:16:28] <coldhead> its like the difference between 2 2  and 22
[19:16:42] <coldhead> its not ONE space, it's ANY space
[19:17:45] <KingDosser> Okay cheers for that :0
[19:18:02] <coldhead> a pleasure
[19:21:14] <AfroTurf> jQuery can't seem to find my new element $("body").append("<p><span><b class=\"nested\"></b></span></p>"); alert($(".nested").length); ?
[19:21:28] <AfroTurf> alert says 0
[19:23:55] <KingDosser> coldhead: Would this : $('#' + department + 'section:nth-child(' + which_task + ')').html(); Get the nth child of department?
[19:25:32] <bittyx-laptop> i'm trying to do something with regex, but i can't see what i'm doing wrong. when i try running console.log('blabla'.replace('/a/g', '')); i get 'blabla' logged, instead of 'blbl' as i'd expect. what am i doing wrong here?
[19:25:45] <coldhead> no i think you'd need ' :nth-child...
[19:26:59] <KingDosser> coldhead: I have this now: $('#' + department + ' article:nth-child(' + which_task + ')').html();
[19:27:11] <coldhead> what is article?
[19:27:14] <KingDosser> It returns whats inside the element, but i want to include the elements tags as well
[19:27:17] <coldhead> if it's a class you want .article
[19:27:36] <KingDosser> No I want a specific article inside department
[19:27:40] <coldhead> oh it's an element? weird
[19:27:46] <KingDosser> HTML5 :)
[19:27:56] <coldhead> ?g outerhtml jquery plugin
[19:27:57] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery: outerHTML | Yelotofu - http://yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/
[19:28:04] <coldhead> you probably want that then ^^
[19:28:13] <KingDosser> I'd rather not get another plugin, is there no way to do it?
[19:28:14] <coldhead> or see ?has
[19:28:15] <bot-t> .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[19:28:35] <coldhead> so $('div:has(a)') will get you divs that contain an a
[19:28:40] <coldhead> and not just the a
[19:28:58] <coldhead> but you are cooking some pretty hairy selectors there and i'm not making it any better
[19:29:06] <KingDosser> will it get me the div as well ?
[19:29:55] <coldhead> yes
[19:30:01] <coldhead> i said it would
[19:30:08] <coldhead> oay attention
[19:30:13] <KingDosser> sorry lol
[19:30:28] <coldhead> pay*
[19:31:10] <KingDosser> Hmm how woud I add that in
[19:31:55] <ngharo> .parent().html() might be easier/quicker
[19:32:00] <SirFunk> is there a way to get the type of element from an el in jquery?
[19:32:12] <coldhead> $('#' + department + ':has*article:nth-child(' + which_task + '))').html();
[19:32:22] <coldhead> oops
[19:32:40] <coldhead> $('#' + department + ':has(article:nth-child(' + which_task + '))').html();
[19:32:55] <ngharo> ?mdc typeof @ SirFunk
[19:32:55] <bot-t> SirFunk, typeof - MDC Docs - The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/typeof
[19:33:07] <ngharo> that may not be what you want ...
[19:33:24] <SirFunk> it's not
[19:33:37] <SirFunk> like if i have <input> i want something that returns 'input'
[19:33:47] <coldhead> this.tagName
[19:33:56] <coldhead> el.tagName
[19:34:08] <SirFunk> ah! thanks
[19:34:12] <KingDosser> Syntax error, unrecognized expression: :has(article:nth-child @coldhead ?
[19:34:37] <coldhead> alert or console.log() the selector
[19:34:45] <coldhead> see how it's fucked up
[19:35:23] <coldhead> probably a missing quote
[19:36:32] <coldhead> ?eval department = 'lol'; which_task = 5; '#' + department + ':has(article:nth-child(' + which_task + '))'
[19:36:32] <bot-t> coldhead: "#lol:has(article:nth-child(5))"
[19:36:38] <coldhead> looks okay to me
[19:38:29] <q[corwin]> Howdy.  Not getting any json responce from this: http://bru.st/vt/  code is here:  http://jsfiddle.net/jJAzc/  -- jsonlink.com says the format is fine. Is there something obvious I should be doing differently?
[19:39:27] <KingDosser> hmmm
[19:39:55] <q[corwin]> I get the Document ready alert but never the data ready one
[19:39:59] <coldhead> q[corwin]: that site is throwing 500 errors
[19:40:11] <q[corwin]> erm, that's new - let me check
[19:40:57] <q[corwin]> ok, all better -messed it up with some debug I just tossed in
[19:41:18] <q[corwin]> back the result described
[19:42:09] <ngharo> q[corwin]: you want to use ?callback=? in the url else you have to specify one

[19:42:22] <KingDosser> Omg coldhead lol whats wrong with this!
[19:42:50] <ngharo> q[corwin]: also your response should include the callback GET argument as the function call
[19:43:39] <KingDosser> coldhead, it outputs this: #design:has(article:nth-child(2))
[19:45:03] <coldhead> KingDosser: what does alert($('#design:has(article:nth-child(2))').length) show
[19:45:10] <coldhead> ?ud dosser
[19:45:14] <bot-t> coldhead, dosser - useless, waster, lazy person
[19:45:21] <KingDosser> lol
[19:45:48] <q[corwin]> got-it, thanks all.
[19:46:07] <coldhead> have my babies, ngharo, you're wonderful

[19:47:26] <coldhead> fuck
[19:47:31] <coldhead> ?p @ KingDosser
[19:47:32] <bot-t> KingDosser, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[19:47:41] <coldhead> make it fail on jsfiddle and we'll try to fix it
[19:47:56] <Tapsy> If anyone has time, I have 4 thumbnail images that get highlighted (red border) individually when the checkbox is checked.  That part is working nicely, however when I uncheck the 'extra toppings' checkbox, then recheck it, the previous highlighted thumbnails are still highlighted.  I need it to reset so that nothing is highlighted.  Any ideas, clues, hints?  http://jsfiddle.net/KPtuT/6/
[19:48:49] <coldhead> Tapsy: are you actually doing a pizza site?
[19:48:57] <coldhead> that is every develper's dream
[19:49:28] <psilo2> not mine
[19:49:29] <KingDosser> coldhead: I have a live link if you would prefer?
[19:49:39] <coldhead> sure KingDosser
[19:49:44] <Tapsy> I am for practice, I'm basically trying to self-learn.  And yes it would be nice if it really worked and I could get a slice (:
[19:50:00] <KingDosser> http://blackboarddev.com/mynt/mynt.html @coldhead - You will need to type something like @design !delete 1 then press enter
[19:50:37] <ngharo> Tapsy: select the images i.e. var images = $('#container img'); then images.removeClass('selected')
[19:52:05] <Tapsy> hey ngharo, I really believed it was fully working last time, then I started playing around with it.  Re-testing
[19:58:31] <coldhead> ?source has

[20:01:04] <q[corwin]> Okay, I'm stuck again - now I get an undefined value passed to my callback function, updated code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/jJAzc/3/
[20:01:33] <coldhead> KingDosser: i don't know if has() is broken or my brain is broken
[20:01:40] <coldhead> do what ngharo said
[20:01:52] <KingDosser> Lol :)
[20:02:09] <coldhead> $('#design article:nth-child(1)').parent()
[20:02:27] <coldhead> something like that
[20:02:50] <coldhead> ngharo: fix q[corwin]'s coads again :)
[20:04:45] <ngharo> q[corwin]: as i said before your response needs to contain the callback the client supplied
[20:05:54] <q[corwin]> ngharo, 'fraid I don't follow - sorry to be think.  *->doc?
[20:05:59] <q[corwin]> s/think/thick
[20:06:05] <ngharo> q[corwin]: whats your server side language?
[20:06:15] <q[corwin]> these are static bits actually
[20:06:37] <ngharo> you'll need something to grab the $get['callback'] value
[20:06:46] <ngharo> if thats making sense
[20:07:01] <ngharo> then wrap your json output inside it
[20:07:17] <q[corwin]> gotcha, something needs to pull "callback=([^&]) from the QUERY_STRING env var, yes?
[20:07:27] <ngharo> yes
[20:07:46] <ngharo> then return $callback($jsondata)
[20:08:37] <q[corwin]> ok, so, if I make the call as me.mine/foo.json?callback=barf  then I'd expect to get back {barf:([ "data1","data2"]}
[20:08:38] <KingDosser> @ngharo: $('#' + department + ' article:nth-child(' + which_task + ') p').parent().html(); gets only the p, whilst $('#' + department + ' article:nth-child(' + which_task + ') ').parent().html(); Gets what I want plus all its siblings. How can I edit this?
[20:08:40] <q[corwin]> is that right?
[20:08:54] <q[corwin]> ohhh
[20:09:19] <q[corwin]> so what I'm really returning is a javascript function, not a block of static json formatted data.  Is THAT correct?
[20:09:25] <ngharo> yes
[20:09:27] <coldhead> KingDosser: you can't get the parent and just one of the children
[20:09:28] <q[corwin]> thanks much
[20:09:47] <KingDosser> I want to get the article
[20:10:15] <coldhead> article:nth-child(n) should get you JUST the nth article
[20:10:36] <KingDosser> Yes but it does not get the <article> tags
[20:11:00] <coldhead> you want outerhtml :\
[20:11:07] <coldhead> why do you need the tags?
[20:11:17] <KingDosser> because they will have the id
[20:11:20] <coldhead> $('article:nth-child(n)').remove() will remove it
[20:11:32] <coldhead> $('article:nth-child(n)').attr('id') will get you the id
[20:11:55] <coldhead> an anyone please make me chocolate cake or kill me
[20:11:58] <coldhead> can*
[20:13:29] <ngharo> KingDosser: maybe do $('#' + department + ' article).find('nth-child(' + which_task + ').andSelf()
[20:14:05] <ngharo> minues the syntax error
[20:14:20] <ngharo> s/minues/minus/
[20:14:42] <coldhead> lol splelink

[20:17:49] <KingDosser> LOL
[20:20:18] <Nyture> Hi, I've tried googling around but I need some more indepth help. I need to dynamically run a php function within my jquery. Namely, when a form button is clicked, I need the jquery to execute a php function to return a value from the database. I looked into ajax, but Im not sure if this is what I need? Any help would be appreciated
[20:20:49] <Nyture> basically, I need for my php function to be "live"
[20:21:06] <KingDosser> AJAX is what you need :)
[20:21:37] <Nyture> can ajax be called for the same page its on, without defining a page uri?
[20:22:05] <KingDosser> Not sure on that one.
[20:22:15] <KingDosser> I suppose its possible
[20:24:05] <Nyture> if theres one thing i learned, everything is possible with code lol
[20:24:21] <KingDosser> Lol yeah i assume that you can do it, never tried though
[20:24:31] <KingDosser> just put an if at the top of your page checking for a post
[20:24:43] <KingDosser> And then contain everything else in an else
[20:24:50] <KingDosser> So that you dont get it infinitely looping
[20:34:26] <draginx> Does firefox still copy + paste content that's set to display:none? (Im setting the display to none using hide())
[20:38:28] <KingDosser> Why are my if statements evaluating inversely
[20:39:04] <tbranyen> wat
[20:39:16] <tbranyen> KingDosser: if conditionals go left to right
[20:40:06] <tbranyen> the only time that changes is if you incur operators that change the precedence order
[20:41:11] <KingDosser> Well I have an if statement that is evaluating true when it shouldnt be
[20:41:50] <KingDosser> @coldhead You still around?
[20:45:07] <tbranyen> KingDosser: are you sure it shouldn't be?
[20:45:10] <tbranyen> paste it
[20:45:19] <KingDosser> tbranyen: http://blackboarddev.com/mynt/mynt.html
[20:45:26] <KingDosser> Type in @design Test
[20:45:50] <tbranyen> alerts test
[20:46:02] <KingDosser> yeah but then after that
[20:46:10] <KingDosser> refresh and try again
[20:48:03] <q[corwin]> ngharo, I'm back
[20:48:07] <q[corwin]> updated JS code here:
[20:48:08] <q[corwin]> http://jsfiddle.net/jJAzc/5/
[20:48:44] <q[corwin]> still get undef, json now wrapped into a javascript function:  http://bru.st/vt/
[20:50:23] <KingDosser> You see tbranyen?
[20:50:31] <ngharo> q[corwin]: no man no! lol
[20:50:37] <q[corwin]> ;)
[20:50:56] <q[corwin]> be gentle, it's my first time :=]
[20:51:09] * coldhead shudders
[20:51:24] <ngharo> q[corwin]: look at ?ajax
[20:51:30] <ngharo> if you want to hardcode your callback like that
[20:51:41] <ngharo> you have to use the jsonpCallback option
[20:51:42] <coldhead> ngharo: you need to prefix ? with see or use
[20:51:53] <ngharo> coldhead: ohh thanks
[20:52:18] <ProLoser|Trmnl> hallo
[20:52:23] <ngharo> q[corwin]: it's best to let jquery handle it how you had it before (callback=?)
[20:53:02] <q[corwin]> that doesn't seem to do anything different
[20:53:06] <ngharo> q[corwin]: and your response should be callback({foo:'bar'})
[20:53:14] <ngharo> not function callback( )
[20:53:23] <q[corwin]> ahh
[20:53:26] <q[corwin]> trying that
[20:56:33] <q[corwin]> does this part look right?  http://bru.st/vt/
[20:59:18] <ngharo> 500
[20:59:29] <q[corwin]> yeah, just saw that - sec
[21:00:03] <q[corwin]> all better
[21:00:27] <ngharo> callback has to be whatever the get argument 'callback' is set to
[21:00:30] <ngharo> !!
[21:01:46] <draginx> Does firefox still copy + paste content that's set to display:none? (Im setting the display to none using hide())
[21:01:50] <q[corwin]> okay, got something here
[21:02:23] <q[corwin]> seems like, and please confirm, I want the callback function returned from json page to have the same name as the 'onDataResult' callback in the jQuery page
[21:02:52] <q[corwin]> This now seems to work:  http://jsfiddle.net/jJAzc/6/
[21:03:44] <q[corwin]> but I'd like not to be back here in 20m when the next one dosen't, so I should try to grok what's going on here
[21:04:31] <q[corwin]> Am I correct that this is working because I identify callback:"callback" and the json wraps the data in callback( ... ) ? (e.g. both called "callback")
[21:04:49] <q[corwin]> not that the name "callback" is magical, just that it must match
[21:05:03] <KingDosser> Yo ma man coldhead lol you there?
[21:05:06] <ngharo> yeah, although i always thought the option was jsonpCallback:
[21:05:10] <ngharo> q[corwin]: but yeah you got it
[21:05:14] <coldhead> somewhat, KingDosser
[21:05:23] <q[corwin]> ok, I'm cooking with gas ngharo - thanks for your patience.
[21:05:44] <ngharo> q[corwin]: you dont have to specify a callback name, jquery will magically insert one for you.  but then you need to grab that on the server side
[21:06:05] <KingDosser> @coldhead: http://blackboarddev.com/mynt/mynt.html When typing @design Random test. It should create a new element under design, but it is somehow executing the code that should be used for deleting
[21:06:12] <KingDosser> There is a random error in the console
[21:06:15] <q[corwin]> that would be painful for me in this case
[21:06:31] <ngharo> ya then just stick to hardcoding it
[21:06:42] <coldhead> KingDosser: it's worth pointing out that you could do this all in a much simpler way
[21:06:50] <KingDosser> how?
[21:07:02] <coldhead> that's a matter for yourself
[21:07:06] <KingDosser> lol
[21:07:15] <coldhead> i'm just saying, looking at this, i an see a smaller implementation trying to break free
[21:07:28] <coldhead> and as fred brooks said "build one to throw away, you will anyway:"
[21:07:35] <coldhead> but lemme look at your issue
[21:08:12] <coldhead> KingDosser: if(task = '!delete'){
[21:08:17] <coldhead> should be ==
[21:09:06] <KingDosser> BS, i swear i fixed that lol
[21:09:11] <KingDosser> and it wasnt working
[21:10:43] <coldhead> ngharo: are you on twitter?
[21:11:45] <ngharo> hardly
[21:11:50] <iDeaman> Any tips for optimizing jquery for a Madonna porn site in Italian?
[21:11:52] <q[corwin]> I'm @mplscorwin
[21:12:00] <q[corwin]> Cause I know y'all care ;)
[21:12:33] <iszak> iDeaman, peen meter
[21:12:35] <KingDosser> coldhead; Thats right, I remember now. I do == and then when i actually try to delete it, it adds it
[21:13:17] <iszak> iDeaman, http://peenmeter.com/
[21:13:18] <coldhead> KingDosser: you probably want to match delete with a regular expression, rather than a string literal
[21:13:34] <KingDosser> why?
[21:13:44] <iDeaman> Seriously?
[21:13:48] <iszak> ya
[21:14:07] <coldhead> KingDosser: a regex can match !DELETE or !Delete
[21:14:13] <coldhead> or whatever else goes wrong
[21:14:23] <iszak> regex to the rescue!
[21:14:31] <iszak> /\b!delete\b/i
[21:14:36] <coldhead> ' ! delete' or  '    !delete '
[21:14:49] <iszak> /\s*!\s*delete\s*/i
[21:15:08] <coldhead> damn you're quick iszak
[21:15:10] <coldhead> :)
[21:15:19] <iszak> awh :(
[21:15:35] <ngharo> imo split the string and parse them as arguments
[21:15:43] <coldhead> here you go, KingDosser, you don't even have to write the regex
[21:15:51] <KingDosser> cheers guys :)
[21:15:56] <coldhead> split the string and regex match the args
[21:16:21] <iDeaman> What are common reasons for site breaking when upgrading from from jquery v1.5 to the latest version?
[21:16:31] <coldhead> ajax
[21:16:35] <coldhead> attr
[21:16:37] <iszak> bad coding
[21:16:57] <iszak> iDeaman, link us to your Modonna porn site in Italian, I will debug it for you at work.
[21:17:04] <KingDosser> i might re write this
[21:17:15] <KingDosser> what is the javascript for regex matching?
[21:17:25] <iszak> ?mdc match
[21:17:26] <bot-t> iszak, match - MDC Docs - Used to retrieve the matches when matching a string against a regular expression . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[21:17:30] <iszak> ?mdc test
[21:17:30] <bot-t> iszak, test - MDC Docs - Executes the search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns true or false . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test
[21:17:38] <iszak> TEST
[21:17:39] <iszak> there we go
[21:17:53] <iDeaman> iszak: I'm still working on the HTML5 audio of Like A Virgin.
[21:18:05] <iszak> that's okay!
[21:18:34] <coldhead> KingDosser: my general advice would be to separate UI stuff like detecting which key is pressed from the effects like moving items in and out. you should try to use small testabe/reuseable functions instead of a monster if statement that does everything
[21:18:56] <iszak> coldhead, how's /ruby/ going btw? I say ruby now because you've basically defected
[21:19:08] <KingDosser> Okay cheers mate. Will see what I can come up with :). Thanks for all of your help coldhead and others.
[21:19:18] <coldhead> lol others
[21:19:25] <coldhead> suck it, nameless hordes
[21:19:30] <KingDosser> lol
[21:19:33] <iszak> FUUU
[21:19:34] <ngharo> haha
[21:19:43] <iszak> no regex for you
[21:19:45] <coldhead> iszak: it's true, ruby is getting a few hours of love day, i'm not ashamed. it's going well
[21:19:57] <iszak> coldhead, you're an infidel!
[21:20:01] <iszak> clojure 4 lyfe
[21:20:05] <ngharo> ruby is kewl (just not rails, yuck!)
[21:20:15] <KingDosser> others including... ngharo and iszak :)
[21:20:33] <iszak> yay
[21:20:38] <coldhead> thanks KD
[21:20:53] <ngharo> i can finally rest
[21:21:01] <coldhead> iszak: clojure has my greater love, i'm still working through 4clojure
[21:21:16] <KingDosser> haha

[21:28:54] <coldhead> aw food can be a great joy
[21:29:01] <coldhead> just ask a fatty
[21:29:31] <iszak> they could have gotten fat off couscous..
[21:29:43] <coldhead> couscous can be a joy!
[21:29:49] <coldhead> mmm garlic and butter
[21:30:30] <iszak> Do dominoes accept eftpos upon delivery?
[21:31:24] <coldhead> no
[21:31:59] <iszak> oh come on, why not.
[21:31:59] <iszak> that's bs

[21:42:17] <paul_irish> BURRITO!
[21:42:25] <ProLoser|Trmnl> hallo paul
[21:42:33] <paul_irish> oh hey trmnl
[21:43:13] <ProLoser|Trmnl> i have a question for you, do you code for google or are you more of community outreach (don't know what it's called)
[21:43:38] <coldhead> he's talking to you, paul_irish
[21:43:44] <iszak> haha community outreach
[21:43:49] <ProLoser|Trmnl> the guy who like
[21:43:59] <ProLoser|Trmnl> i forgot what it's called, talks to the community, gives product demos, etc
[21:44:01] <coldhead> the guy who runs sheltered workshops for the homeless
[21:44:07] <ProLoser|Trmnl> yes that exactly
[21:44:34] <iszak> coldhead++
[21:46:08] <ProLoser|Trmnl> anyone here work with <video> much? i'm having a strange behavior in safari
[21:46:30] <ProLoser|Trmnl> one of the plugins I'm working with doesn't properly 'hide' the video element using overflow:hidden when it's off-screen
[21:47:02] <ProLoser|Trmnl> wow, i'm so glad irssi caught me from accidentally pasting a code block lol
[21:47:12] <ProLoser|Trmnl> here is the demo (view in safari) http://jsfiddle.net/pbbYP/220/
[21:50:37] <KingDosser> Yo coldhead, can you not do this: function set_input(value = ''){} ?
[21:51:07] <ProLoser|Trmnl> no one loves me :(
[21:52:38] <paul_irish> ProLoser|Trmnl: i havent yet written code that's gone into chrome.
[21:52:51] <paul_irish> but will have a commit for the chrome devtools hopefully soon
[21:53:00] <Sirisian> Shouldn't: $(document).scroll(MouseWheel); work? It never fires the event for me.
[21:54:10] <coldhead> you cannot, KingDosser
[21:56:04] <coldhead> KingDosser: http://jsfiddle.net/kGDHS/
[21:58:24] <coldhead> ProLoser|Trmnl: i love you but that doesn't mean i've worked with <video>
[21:58:27] <coldhead> don't take it so personal
[21:58:48] <ProLoser|Trmnl> lies
[21:59:21] <ProLoser|Trmnl> so i just found out that the problem i'm having is being caused BY jsfiddle
[21:59:27] <ProLoser|Trmnl> strange
[21:59:31] <ProLoser|Trmnl> could just be the frame or something
[21:59:39] <ProLoser|Trmnl> paul_irish: when can we expect the next yayquery?
[22:01:39] <paul_irish> ProLoser|Trmnl: christmas
[22:03:11] <KingDosser> cheers coldhead
[22:03:26] <iszak> paul_irish, :( bit long away don't you think?
[22:03:49] <coldhead> why don't you rewatch some existing ones?
[22:03:54] <coldhead> that's what i do
[22:03:57] <iszak> I haven't watched them all yet.
[22:03:59] <coldhead> instead of having real life friends
[22:04:25] <shiftins> is there a way to use a jquery object as the scope in a selector? for instance $(a, $(obj)).live(function() {}) ?
[22:04:27] <iszak> brb
[22:04:29] <paul_irish> iszak: TWSS ! !! ! !
[22:04:38] <iszak> paul_irish, pardon?
[22:04:49] <paul_irish> oh there's the word "away" in there
[22:04:51] <paul_irish> damn it.
[22:04:51] <shiftins> make that $('a', $(obj).live('mouseover', ....
[22:04:52] <coldhead> ?delegate @ shiftins
[22:04:53] <bot-t> shiftins, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[22:05:10] <iszak> paul_irish, err, okay.
[22:05:14] <shiftins> thanks
[22:05:32] <paul_irish> iszak: "paul_irish, :( bit long don't you think?"
[22:05:44] <paul_irish> paul_irish: "iszak, thats what she said!"
[22:05:54] <coldhead> she did, i heard her
[22:07:29] <dr0id> lsthemes IS BACK ? :O
[22:07:45] <coldhead> not for long!
[22:08:40] <dr0id> required a kick too :P
[22:08:50] <coldhead> oops!
[22:09:13] <dr0id> hehe :D
[22:09:14] <iszak> coldhead, whattt when did you get op? :(
[22:09:18] <iszak> I'm jelly
[22:09:26] <dr0id> iszak!!!!!
[22:09:55] <coldhead> it's my first day, iszak
[22:10:40] <iszak> go away
[22:16:39] <ProLoser|Trmnl> coldhead: i decided to start my own podcast
[22:16:52] <ProLoser|Trmnl> i went on a roadtrip and tried collecting podcasts to listen to
[22:17:06] <ProLoser|Trmnl> and i realized there are absolutely no good podcasts on design, except for yayquery
[22:17:18] <coldhead> is it available yet?!
[22:17:29] <ProLoser|Trmnl> there is only a small handful of podcasts, and they are all fluff and no content
[22:17:42] <ProLoser|Trmnl> coldhead: we came up with the idea yesterday, still putting it together lol
[22:17:52] <ProLoser|Trmnl> i'm open to collaborators :)
[22:17:53] <coldhead> cool man, send word when it's up!
[22:31:15] <KingDosser> Yo coldhead
[22:31:26] <coldhead> si?
[22:31:26] * abjorn wiggles
[22:31:44] <KingDosser> http://blackboarddev.com/mynt/mynt.html I made my code a lot prettier (I think)
[22:31:59] <KingDosser> But there is an error, I think the way Im using indexOf is wrong.
[22:33:51] <coldhead> KingDosser: eschew new Array("development","design","business");
[22:34:07] <coldhead> prefer ["development","design","business"];
[22:34:30] <coldhead> and yeah, i'd still advocate regex over indexOf
[22:34:35] <coldhead> for the case insentivity
[22:34:43] <coldhead> insensitivity
[22:35:08] <coldhead> or maybe you'd prefer
[22:35:10] <coldhead> um
[22:35:12] <coldhead> lemme fiddle
[22:35:17] <ProLoser|Trmnl> stop being so insensitive
[22:36:44] <KingDosser> ^ lol
[22:37:10] <KingDosser> coldhead Is it an improvement though ? :)
[22:38:01] <coldhead> yes, it looks much more manageable
[22:38:06] <coldhead> you must have had good advice
[22:38:07] <KingDosser> :)
[22:38:14] <KingDosser> yes only from the best cough
[22:38:37] <KingDosser> Array["development", "design", "business"] is not a constructor
[22:39:32] <coldhead> ?eval ['i', 'am', 'an', 'array', 'literal'];
[22:39:33] <bot-t> coldhead: ["i", "am", "an", "array", "literal"]
[22:39:33] <KingDosser> jokes i get it now
[22:39:36] <amid_hasan> Hello
[22:39:48] <KingDosser> i left 'new array' in
[22:40:09] <amid_hasan> Whats an easy way to validate for emptiness using jquery/ajax?
[22:40:59] <KingDosser> if($(this).val != ''){} ?
[22:41:04] <KingDosser> woops
[22:41:17] <KingDosser> if($(this).val() != ''){}
[22:42:01] <amid_hasan> how would I loop through this and change class of invalid item and also disable the submit button until they are valid?
[22:42:25] <KingDosser> err
[22:42:55] <coldhead> KingDosser: http://jsfiddle.net/Jk6BD/
[22:44:11] <KingDosser> $('#form').submit(function(){
[22:44:17] <coldhead> i would use the validation plugin, amid_hasan
[22:44:24] <coldhead> then i'd get drunk
[22:44:28] <amid_hasan> lol
[22:45:41] <amid_hasan> KingDosser: $('#form').submit(function(){ ... run validation... disable button, change classes if not valid...? });
[22:45:53] <KingDosser> Yes
[22:46:16] <amid_hasan> Thanks
[22:49:17] <KingDosser> is it console or console.log ?
[22:49:18] <amid_hasan> coldhead: let's say I have an array of numbers, and I want to run a script that compared the number values in one array with that of another array, and then make the matched elements in the second array bold. Any ideas?
[22:49:25] <amid_hasan> *compares
[22:51:22] <coldhead> console.log('lol')
[22:51:26] <KingDosser> lol
[22:51:38] <KingDosser> take a look at the code now
[22:51:45] <KingDosser> I have a problem with the first function
[22:51:55] <KingDosser> its not defining parsed_input[1] and [2]
[22:51:57] <coldhead> amid_hasan: unless you have really unusualy requirements you should tyr to use th validation plugin
[22:52:19] <coldhead> it does most of what you'd want for free, and you can specify a custom rule like the one you mentioned quite easily
[22:52:33] <coldhead> you WOULD have to read the docs, but it should save you time overall
[22:52:41] <coldhead> validation is boring
[22:53:58] <coldhead> var parsed_input = new Array();
[22:54:02] <coldhead> var parsed_input = [];
[22:54:30] <KingDosser> huh?
[22:54:37] <amid_hasan> um
[22:54:46] <amid_hasan> the second question was actually for a different function
[22:54:47] <coldhead> i'm still banging on about not using new Whatever();
[22:55:02] <amid_hasan> i'm trying to match winning lottery numbers in an array to my numbers which are also in an array
[22:55:09] <coldhead> where is it complaining, KingDosser?
[22:55:18] <coldhead> this alert() everytime i type is making me want to kill
[22:55:19] <KingDosser> lines 7-10
[22:55:24] <KingDosser> Lol
[22:55:45] <coldhead> parsed_input[0] = input[0].replace('@','');
[22:55:47] <coldhead> maybe should be
[22:55:57] <coldhead> parsed_input = input[0].replace('@','');
[22:56:08] <coldhead> otherwise parsed_input is an array of arrays?
[22:56:14] <KingDosser> good thinking
[22:56:39] <coldhead> got something you can paste, amid_hasan?
[22:56:43] <coldhead> ?p
[22:56:44] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[22:56:53] <amid_hasan> let me put something together in jsfiddle coldhead
[22:57:06] <coldhead> KingDosser: if you have time you should read eloquent JS and or js-in-10-minutes
[22:57:24] <KingDosser> ive got to go in like 3 minutes and id like to finish this
[22:57:28] <amid_hasan> eloquent JS is a free ebook?
[22:57:29] <KingDosser> can you give me a hand please?
[22:57:37] <coldhead> trying to help, KingDosser
[22:57:42] <KingDosser> cheers nate
[22:57:43] <KingDosser> mate*

[22:59:26] <coldhead> i was just thinking of that movie Rain :(
[22:59:27] <coldhead> poor jim
[22:59:51] <coldhead> so what's wrong now?
[22:59:59] <KingDosser> nothings working
[23:00:02] <KingDosser> lol
[23:00:07] <Predat0r> hi
[23:00:08] <coldhead> good bug reporting
[23:00:15] <KingDosser> just for you :)
[23:00:29] <KingDosser> okay proper logging now
[23:00:32] <jzaun> Hi all. Is it possible to access the underlying XMLHttpRequest object from the success callback of $.ajax() ?
[23:01:30] <KingDosser> parsed_input[1] is being set to everything
[23:01:39] <amid_hasan> will be back
[23:01:45] <coldhead> i don't know how replace() works

[23:03:27] <bot-t> coldhead: ["!remove", "development", "1"]
[23:03:31] <coldhead> that is what i'd be using
[23:04:01] <Predat0r> guys how to run a script one time?
[23:04:24] <KingDosser> what is that?

[23:04:50] <coldhead> don't worry if you have it working, it's just the first thing i'd reach for
[23:07:35] <KingDosser> omg its not doing the inArray thing properly now
[23:07:58] <jzaun> Hi all. Is it possible to access the underlying XMLHttpRequest object from the success callback of $.ajax()? I need access to the responseBody property while in IE
[23:07:59] <KingDosser> coldhead
[23:08:20] <coldhead> jzaun: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L409
[23:08:31] <coldhead> have a look around there for the original?
[23:08:58] <coldhead> KingDosser: i'm looking
[23:09:01] <KingDosser> gtg
[23:09:14] <coldhead> talk at you never :(
[23:10:19] <KingDosser> lol quick any fix?
[23:10:32] <coldhead> no! i can't even see what the problem is
[23:10:39] <coldhead> and i don't have my magic wand
[23:10:40] <KingDosser> inArray
[23:10:47] <KingDosser> type @design !delete
[23:10:52] <KingDosser> its not recongising delete
[23:11:41] <coldhead> i think it's searching for !delete
[23:11:48] <coldhead> !delete =/= delete
[23:12:03] <coldhead> you need to add or remove the ! somewhere
[23:12:17] <coldhead> maybe a replace like your @ replace line?
[23:12:47] <KingDosser> im typing !delete
[23:14:00] <coldhead> ?eval $.inArray('delete', ['delete','lol])
[23:14:00] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal

[23:14:28] <jzaun> coldhead: I'm not seeing anything to reference the XMLHttpRequest object, but then again I dont really know the code all that well. I take it there is no way to add this capability without directly editing the source code of jquery?
[23:14:41] <KingDosser> i gtg cya
[23:14:49] <KingDosser> cheers
[23:14:58] <coldhead> jzaun: there probably is but i don't know the code very well either, i just trying to point you in the right direction
[23:15:24] <coldhead> i will have a bette rlook now that KingJerkwad has gone
[23:15:35] <jzaun> cold, thanks :D
[23:18:52] <amid_hasan> ok the code is up http://jsfiddle.net/WYuLu/30/
[23:19:02] <coldhead> jzaun: you can't use responseText ?
[23:19:23] <amid_hasan> Trying to put array of numbers into div, and compare the two arrays, then make the numbers that match bold
[23:19:30] <mercury_> hello. One quick question. If i use jquery UI slider widget and on event stop call some function in which is ajax request the slider goes back to start. functions on stop is executed but slider goes back to start. I figured out that this happens only when ajax request is made bacause if i put only some alert in function it works. Any idea how to solve this ? Thanks!
[23:19:48] <jzaun> coldhead, no in IE binary data gets truncated at the first null in the stream
[23:20:22] <jzaun> responseBody + some VBscript magig lets you get access to the full binary data
[23:23:41] <mercury_> any idea ?
[23:23:56] <amid_hasan> any help how to match items in array? http://jsfiddle.net/WYuLu/30/
[23:24:40] <jzaun> coldhead, https://gist.github.com/161492 is a full (non-jQuery) example to access binary data. I'm trying to use a very minor subset (just getByteAt) inside a jQuery plugin i'm writing. I suppose I could manually do the ajax call, but I would much rather use $.ajax()
[23:26:04] <coldhead> jzaun: just a hunch, try adding the fields you want to xhrFields
[23:26:28] <coldhead> i know that's for setting them on the XHR object but it looks like it might get them back for you too
[23:26:52] <jzaun> lemme try :)
[23:26:57] <coldhead> so um  {blah blah, xhrFields: {thingYouWant: null}, etc etc}
[23:27:14] <coldhead> ajpiano would know
[23:27:45] <KWhat4> is there a way to check if some jquery object is the child of another object or should it just be something like obj1.find(obj2).lenght
[23:28:14] <coldhead> i would just use find()
[23:28:18] <coldhead> there might be a better way

[23:30:39] <KWhat4> thanks coldhead,  you wouldnt happen to know what .contains( document.body, document.body  ) would return do you
[23:31:07] <coldhead> mercury_: i don't know shit about UI and that sounds thorny, maybe try forum.jquery.com and wait for ajpiano to wake up to show it to him
[23:31:21] <gf3> ?tias @ KWhat4
[23:31:22] <bot-t> KWhat4, Try It And See
[23:31:23] <coldhead> ?tias @ KWhat4
[23:31:26] <coldhead> lol
[23:31:30] <snover> ohfffff
[23:31:34] <gf3> shiiiiiiiiiiiii
[23:33:42] <mercury_> coldhead thx... in this nopaste is more explained. http://nopaste.info/a049a391a4.html
[23:34:14] <coldhead> mercury_: actually snover and gf3 are incredibly clever AND awake
[23:34:25] <mercury_> :)
[23:34:36] <coldhead> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/WYuLu/31/
[23:34:44] <snover> mercury_: wangs wangs wangs boobies
[23:34:59] <coldhead> bahahah
[23:35:06] <coldhead> (god give me strength)
[23:35:30] <mercury_> : )
[23:35:31] <snover> thatâs what he said
[23:36:03] <gf3> mercury_: make a JS Fiddle
[23:36:16] <amid_hasan> coldhead: follow up, what does the parameter 'i' in the function stand for?
[23:37:00] <coldhead> it's the index in the array
[23:37:04] <KWhat4> so you cant pass a jquery object to contains ?
[23:37:10] <coldhead> wn[i] = n;
[23:37:12] <gf3> it's the "intimacy" level
[23:37:17] <gf3> the higher the better
[23:37:23] <gf3> that's why you use i++
[23:37:35] <coldhead> I AM TAKING AWAY ALL YOUR CRACK PIPES UNTIL YOU BEHAVE
[23:37:46] <gf3> :(
[23:38:13] <snover> gf3: you still have your hot knives though
[23:38:15] <amid_hasan> thank you so much coldhead! my brain fart just died
[23:38:16] <snover> donât be sad
[23:38:23] <jzaun> coldhead, that seems to be breaking everything on IE now, but I can't tell for sure till tomorrow as I can only use http://browsera.com at home (im on a mac).
[23:38:37] <phrearch> hey
[23:38:38] <phrearch> morning
[23:38:39] <phrearch> :)
[23:38:40] <snover> HEY
[23:38:42] <gf3> coldhead == #jquery
[23:38:46] <snover> DONâT YELL AT ME
[23:39:01] <phrearch> i wasn't yelling...
[23:39:25] <snover> coldhead: arbitrate
[23:39:27] <phrearch> i was wondering how to prevent an event handler to be registered twice or more in my vcode
[23:39:27] <coldhead> jzaun: virtually anyone knows more about ajax than me, i'll shutup
[23:39:54] <mercury_> gf3: i cant use ajax in this js Fiddle because there is no external file.
[23:39:58] <phrearch> is this the most common approach? $('a').unbind('click').click(function{ ?
[23:40:06] <gf3> mercury_: JS Fiddle has mock ajax
[23:40:07] <coldhead> snover: do you know how to access the original xhr object since the new ajax() stuff got done?
[23:40:17] <coldhead> specifically responseBody?
[23:40:19] <jzaun> coldhear: I thank you for your help either way :)
[23:40:30] <gf3> phrearch: that's generally a bad idea
[23:40:36] <snover> coldhead: you shouldnât have to ever do that
[23:40:46] <gf3> phrearch: what if some exterior code relies on a click event?
[23:40:51] <coldhead> jzaun wants to, snover
[23:40:58] <coldhead> for something i don't understand
[23:41:10] <gf3> Ctrl + Alt + Delete
[23:41:13] <snover> for âthere is no public standard that applies to this propertyâ programming
[23:41:19] <phrearch> gf3: hm, more like $('#my-very-customized-element').click
[23:41:25] <coldhead> i thought you could add any special fields to xhrFields but noo
[23:41:38] <mercury_> gf3: simple alert doesnt work ? http://jsfiddle.net/bd2DR/1/
[23:41:50] <phrearch> i have to make sure that events arent registered twice, which happen alot in my page-refreshless app atm
[23:41:56] <jzaun> snover: I need access to it in IE to read binary data. accessing the binary data from responseText in IE breaks after the first null character
[23:42:03] <snover> I donât know about that. I donât know why jzaun canât look at the jquery source itself to find out :)
[23:42:20] <coldhead> i tried to look at the source for him but it's more than 10 lines long!
[23:42:22] <phrearch> is it possible to check whether an element has an event handler already?
[23:42:27] <mercury_> the problem is that when i call some function which contains ajax request the position of SELECT is back to 1 and not on the last clicked.
[23:42:52] <coldhead> thanks snover
[23:43:03] <jzaun> snover: I'm trying to look through the source... I'm just not following it very well :/
[23:43:04] <coldhead> i will try to be a better person next time
[23:43:06] <gf3> mercury_: http://jsfiddle.net/bd2DR/3/
[23:43:29] <gf3> mercury_: a) your code was bad   b) you had the JS selected to be wrapped and called on load
[23:43:59] <snover> thatâs a reasonable reason
[23:44:19] <snover> i tried to get jaubourg to simply it but failed
[23:44:20] <mercury_> snover : thank you !
[23:44:28] <mercury_> gf3!
[23:44:35] <coldhead> simplify?
[23:45:17] <coldhead> jzaun: what about you use a jQuery 1.4 release that gives you the native XHR?
[23:45:26] <coldhead> don't tell anyone i suggested that
[23:45:31] <coldhead> shit, wrong window
[23:46:05] <jzaun> coldhead: lol :)
[23:46:25] <coldhead> IN YOUR FACE, JAUBOURG
[23:46:27] <mercury_> where is this demo php file for testing ajax ?
[23:46:47] <snover> as far as i am aware the transport is abstracted away so you canât access it directly
[23:47:01] <jammsen> Hi guys
[23:47:49] <jzaun> snover: is there a reason for hiding it?
[23:48:04] <snover> itâs supposed to be transport agnostic
[23:48:18] <coldhead> ?mlu
[23:48:19] <bot-t> much like urself
[23:48:34] <snover> you could always create your own transport that exposes the responseBody on the fake xhr object
[23:48:53] <jammsen> im totaly new to jquery, i want to build a switch for visibility, if i check a checkbox, the file input should be visible and if i uncheck it should go inivisible, my problem is, i have no idea how i check if the attribute hidden is set to 1 or 0, any clues?
[23:49:05] <jzaun> snover: I'm trying to do a very simplified version of https://gist.github.com/161492  I just need the getByteAt method. but seeing as I'm writing my code in jQuery I thought I would use $.ajax()
[23:49:55] <snover> jzaun: why exactly are you trying to transit binary data?
[23:50:08] <jzaun> snover: creating my own transport... I wouldn't know where to begin doing that :(
[23:50:40] <jzaun> the datafiles I'm working with (ANSI graphics) are binary.
[23:51:00] <jzaun> snover: http://justinzaun.com/ansi/ for a working (in everything but IE) example
[23:51:40] <snover> jzaun: not sure what that page is supposed to do, all I see is â14621 - [undefined]â
[23:52:13] <gf3> mercury_: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[23:52:30] <mercury_> thx.
[23:52:50] <jzaun> snover: should be drawing to a canvas - I tested in chrome, ff, safari, opera
[23:52:58] <snover> jzaun: iâm using ff4, nothing
[23:52:59] <snover> also
[23:53:01] <snover> my recommendation would be to, like, run a server-side preprocessor to convert CP850 to UTF-8
[23:53:07] <gf3> jzaun: maybe consider not using AJAX
[23:53:18] <gf3> jzaun: perhaps a websocket + fallback
[23:53:22] <gf3> a la juggernaut
[23:53:43] <snover> heh, WS
[23:53:54] <gf3> PLUS fallback
[23:53:55] <gf3> c'mon
[23:54:05] <snover> yes, do use a technology that is disabled by default everywhere :P
[23:54:15] <gf3> mostwheres
[23:54:21] <mercury_> gf3: can you tell me how to call some function when jquery ui slider change. I i sucessfully add data in it and populate select but the problem is when i call ajax function with onchange event on slider. Slider goes back to start on change but only if i call ajax request. If i pust just alert in the function it works. Any idea.. sorry to bother you so much!
[23:54:25] <jomofcw> Morning !
[23:54:28] <snover> also Iâm quite unclear that the binary encapsulation is actually implemented by anyone
[23:54:56] <jzaun> snover - I broke ff4 trying to get ie working it looks like.
[23:55:07] <jzaun> I'll undo the ie stuff and it will work
[23:55:12] <gf3> mercury_: no, show me a simplified version of what you have so far, and where it's failing
[23:55:24] <mercury_> ok
[23:55:28] <jzaun> just seems off to hide the original object, it doesn't hurt to have it accessible
[23:56:04] <gf3> mercury_: I am here to help you solve problems, not write code :)
[23:56:21] <jammsen> im totaly new to jquery, i want to build a switch for visibility, if i check a checkbox, the file input should be visible and if i uncheck it should go inivisible, my problem is, i have no idea how i check if the attribute hidden is set to 1 or 0, any clues?
[23:56:39] <gf3> use jQuery
[23:56:58] <jammsen> i tried
[23:57:00] <jammsen> if($('input[name="' + senderName + '"]').attr('disabled') == 'disabled') {
[23:57:05] <jammsen> but i wont work :(
[23:57:13] <coldhead> i agree, jzaun
[23:57:44] <mekwall> jammsen: there's no attribute called hidden
[23:57:59] <mekwall> jammsen: are you talking about the css attribute visibility?
[23:58:05] <Clonix> jammsen: tried == 'true' or 'false'?
[23:58:20] <mekwall> jammsen: you might want to check the :visible selector ;)
[23:58:22] <coldhead> .is(':checked')
[23:59:28] <jammsen> <input id="ArticleConfig2SGfxupload" hidden="1" type="file" disabled="disabled" name="data[ArticleConfig][2_S_gfxupload]">
[23:59:32] <jammsen> thats my input
[23:59:39] <jammsen> its html valid
[23:59:50] <jammsen> it has disabled and hidden
