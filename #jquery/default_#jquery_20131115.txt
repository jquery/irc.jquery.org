[00:07:47] <raj> I could listen to you all day Cork ;)
[00:08:16] <Cork> ok?
[00:08:26] <raj> lol
[00:08:29] <raj> boner
[00:20:30] <Serdar> can anybody tell me, why this is not working, I don't get it... http://jsfiddle.net/abkNM/1574/
[00:21:34] <Serdar> I guess I am missing something important here...
[00:43:19] <Serdar> :'(
[00:44:22] <raj> Serdar, your parenthesis I believe
[00:45:36] <Serdar> you mean of the row?
[00:45:40] <Serdar> let me check
[00:46:21] <raj> not sure of what
[00:46:33] <raj> you can remove line by line until you get to the bottom of it
[00:46:42] <raj> just gut it between parenthesis
[00:46:50] <raj> when the error disappears, you found the problem section
[00:47:48] <Serdar> if I remove the rows it looks fine, empty but fine. but I want to add rows :/
[00:48:29] <Serdar> or could it be, because I use " within '
[00:50:42] <Serdar> urgs, is this because of the newlines...
[01:03:24] <faddah> Serdar - suggest taking all out except one case (one instance of "var row = $('<tr name="blubber@blubb.be">..." etc., instead of the four you have in there), and try making just that work. you get that working, then you can add them back in. also, make sure your id tags (#) in your html are exactly where you want them for where your code adds the rows.
[01:04:11] <kpl> Anyone tested if/how the Chosen jQuery plugin is able to follow jQuery UI themeroller styles?
[01:05:08] <faddah> Serdar - also, i don't see where you are using 'within' in that jsfiddle?
[01:07:19] <Serdar> within?
[01:07:57] <faddah> Serdar - you previously said, and i quote: "or could it be, because I use " within '"
[01:08:00] <Serdar> sorry I don't get it, could be because my daugther is trying to use a fluete for a first time :D
[01:08:42] <Serdar> $('... <name="blubber@blubb.be"> ...');
[01:08:53] <faddah> anyhow, reduce things down and get one row to work, or one element of one row. then add slowly back in from there.
[01:09:23] <Cork> Serdar: you have line breaks in your strings
[01:09:24] <Serdar> yeah, this is what I will do next
[01:09:26] <Cork> that isn't supported
[01:09:45] <Serdar> isn't supported by jfiddle or javascript?
[01:09:49] <Cork> javascript
[01:09:58] <Cork> '' + ''
[01:10:02] <faddah> and it's past 1 am (1300) where i am, left coast, oregon of u.s. - off to bed. night all.
[01:10:07] <Cork> or ['', '', '', ''].join('')
[01:10:11] <Cork> is what you need to do
[01:10:19] <Cork> (let later one is recommended)
[01:10:51] <Serdar> night faddah
[01:11:06] <Serdar> Cork, I see, I will try that and rethink it and cae back then
[01:11:22] <Cork> Serdar: http://jsfiddle.net/abkNM/1577/ line 16 - 23
[01:13:38] <faddah> one way you _can_ do line breaks in strings in JS, using regular expressions and sticking it in a var: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4558008/line-breaks-using-javascript-strings
[01:14:18] <Cork> faddah: no that won't help here
[01:14:31] <Cork> cause the problem is that the js parser will throw
[01:14:46] <Cork> faddah: that code converts \n to <br> and it is a totally different matter
[01:15:36] <faddah> Cork - o.k., sorry. i should just go to bed. 'night again.

[01:26:26] <hurdos> Cork: Hi, a such syntax: $.when(arr) or exactly $.when.apply(null, arr)?

[01:34:20] <ph88> hey i have a button with a little image in the corner. When i click the image i get the image as selector, but when i click around the image (still in the button) i get the button as selector. How do i make it so that i always get the button ??
[01:34:46] <Cork> ph88: are you using event.target?
[01:34:51] <ph88> yes
[01:34:58] <Cork> then you can't
[01:35:04] <ph88> o_O
[01:35:13] <Cork> $(event.target).closet('button') ?
[01:35:22] <ph88> closest sounds good !
[01:35:25] <ph88> let's try
[01:39:11] <ph88> $(e.target).closest('button') too bad didn't work :|
[01:39:48] <Cork> that should work if the image is a child of the button
[01:40:27] <Cork> AND that the button is actually <button> :)

[01:51:50] <Colmea> (I say beforeStop event because I know I can do "$( this ).sortable( 'cancel' );" in it. But if there is another event, it's ok for me

[02:41:24] <cloudgeek> what you use in linux ? alternative for tool Fiddler for http request.??
[02:43:51] <seutje> cloudgeek: wireshark?
[02:44:18] <Cork> i basically just use the tools from the browser
[02:44:25] <Cork> i've rarely found me needing more
[02:44:39] <Cork> and ya, when i do wireshark is the tool to go for
[02:45:34] <seutje> yeah, network tab + server logs pretty much always get me where I need to be
[02:45:50] <seutje> also, fiddler claims to support any system
[02:47:13] <cloudgeek> Cork: what is the tool name for browser ?
[02:47:30] <cloudgeek> seutje: I have no idea I am also asking?
[02:47:32] <Cork> cloudgeek: the built in developer tools that exist in all modern browsers
[02:47:40] <cloudgeek> Cork: okay
[02:48:25] <Cork> only cavias is that the tools in ie sucks
[02:48:40] <seutje> they're getting there, slowly
[02:48:48] <Cork> VERY slowly
[02:48:50] <seutje> haven't tried ie11s devtools yet though
[02:49:10] <cloudgeek> I use firefox, I am on linux OS
[02:49:18] <cloudgeek> most time I use ubuntu or debian
[02:49:24] <cloudgeek> I think firebug
[02:49:33] <Cork> cloudgeek: firebug is nice for firefox
[02:49:40] <cloudgeek> or using mozila developer tools I need to get work
[02:49:44] <seutje> their native one is really shaping up lately
[02:49:44] <Cork> it still brings a few features that native isn't supporting
[02:49:55] <cloudgeek> Cork: ohh cool
[02:49:58] <seutje> but it has 3D view!
[02:50:22] <Cork> that was actually added before 3d view
[02:50:22] <cloudgeek> seutje: then what's your advise
[02:50:28] <Cork> sorry before the developer tools was added
[02:51:05] <seutje> cloudgeek: I prefere chrome's devtools myself
[02:51:12] <cloudgeek> what else I can use on Linux
[02:51:12] <Cork> seutje: you made me look :)
[02:51:24] <Cork> seutje: ie11 actually looks like its dev tools might be usable
[02:51:31] <seutje> \o/
[02:51:46] <seutje> this is it, guys... the future we all heard so much about
[02:52:23] <Cork> now we just have to wait for xp to die so we can all stop caring about pre ie 11
[02:52:58] <cloudgeek> I am not a window user at all
[02:53:22] <Cork> well i use it for testing
[02:53:34] <Cork> there isn't really a way around that
[02:54:46] <Cork> what really is scaring the shit out of me is the new firefox theme
[03:09:14] <cloudgeek> seutje: I would like to use thme
[03:09:17] <cloudgeek> them
[03:09:28] <cloudgeek> I but I hate chorme
[03:12:16] <MePipe> cloudgeek, why
[03:15:11] <seutje> Cork: think the nightly even has reflow logging
[03:15:24] <Cork> ya
[03:15:34] <Cork> well reflow flashing and logging
[03:15:41] <MePipe> For hundread of years ago, I was using Firefox. But when chrome came, I started to use it. But when it didnt have "view background image" I switched back to Firefox.
[03:15:57] <MePipe> But I use chrome these days, and like its dev tools
[03:17:39] <Cork> for built in tools i would say they are very close now days
[03:18:10] <Cork> there is a set of features from one tool that i miss in the other
[03:18:20] <Cork> anv vice versa
[03:18:23] <Cork> *and
[03:18:37] * webchao feels like a powerful JS developer now he understood and internalized the concept of $.Deferred !
[03:18:41] <webchao> its awesome!
[03:19:06] <webchao> my async calls will never be the same :P
[03:19:27] <Cork> ya, i remember how hard i found it to understand deferred the first time i looked at it
[03:19:36] <webchao> yeah, took some time for me :P
[03:19:40] <Cork> until i found that the docs made it sound magical
[03:19:52] <Cork> when all it did was adding callbacks to an object and passing it around :)
[03:19:58] <webchao> yup
[03:19:59] <seutje> I'm still not entirely sure where the difference lies between deferred and promise
[03:20:03] <Cork> i had to read the code to understand how simple it actually was
[03:20:17] <webchao> i called it to 'eventify' functions
[03:20:18] <Cork> seutje: it is the same thing
[03:20:30] <seutje> that's what I assumed
[03:20:30] <Cork> seutje: you use a deferred to generate a promise
[03:20:31] <Serdar> Cork, the strange thing is, that it works at fiddle, but not local. Is it possible, that this join does not work if there are some variables within?
[03:20:34] <webchao> instead of having a normal return value, it basically triggers 'success' or 'fail'
[03:21:01] <Cork> webchao: what?
[03:21:03] <Cork> no
[03:21:19] <Cork> Serdar: missing the context here
[03:21:21] <Joey__> you know you're a coder when you think "Excel didn't remove the leading zeroes in this number, how come" and it takes you a minute to realize the number is in HEX notation and "normal" people don't identify that as a number :p
[03:21:44] <Serdar> Cork, I mean something like this: $(['...', ' <td name="mode">' + users.list[uID].mode + '</td>', '...'].join(''));
[03:21:56] <Cork> ah
[03:22:02] <Cork> Serdar: any error when you run that locally?
[03:22:05] <webchao> Cork: well it _is_ basically like that, it allows us to bind callbacks on if a function did execute successfully. the terminology might not have been correct
[03:22:10] <Cork> it doesn't use any variables so...
[03:22:35] <Serdar> Cork, they appear I also can see the table, but this is not sorted like on fiddle and also not using the theme
[03:22:56] <Cork> webchao: well deferred is a way to allow you to call functions from daisy-chained calls
[03:23:00] <webchao> Cork: anyway, even if i cannot expess it simply in a correct way, i understood it :P
[03:23:21] <webchao> Cork: yes
[03:23:22] <Cork> it isn't about return or not return
[03:23:57] <Cork> Serdar: make sure you have loaded the needed libs and css
[03:24:16] <synju> guys, I'm looking for a solution, I need to find a way to send through $_POST along with $_FILES, via a jquery plugin, the problem is that I need to be able to edit the $_POST before anything goes through, it must be ajax, and I've already tried jquery.forms, uploadify & jquery uploader ... all of which has either not allowed me to edit the data before submitting or have cause my app go straight to the processing .php file and not return upon using it a secon
[03:24:16] <synju> d time. Any ideas?
[03:24:23] <webchao> good, then scratch the 'instead of having a normal return value,' :P
[03:24:49] <webchao> anyway i am not good in words. thanks for clarification
[03:25:23] <synju> a plugin that would allow me to edit $_POST before submitting and have a data response would be nice.
[03:26:14] <webchao> synju: check out $.ajaxSetup
[03:26:48] <synju> ok will, do.. any other suggestions?
[03:27:31] <webchao> with a normal POST submit, you cannot set HTTP headers, ajax has to be the way to go
[03:30:24] <synju> ive got tabular data with an edit button on each row, that button opens up a dialog box with a form in it, the form has a file input as well as other inputs like changing the book to which the file belongs etc...  Thats what I need to be able to submit, everything in that dialog box. already have the processing php file, its just getting that data to it and being able to repetitively click edit etc.. without any bugs.
[03:31:05] <synju> anyway, brb checking out $.ajaxSetup
[03:32:27] <webchao> $.ajaxSetup allows you to set arbitrary data to every ajax request - we use it to pass an auth token on every request
[03:32:37] <synju> hmm, $.post wouldnt let me send through $_FILES
[03:32:47] <Cork> it will
[03:32:49] <synju> would $.ajaxSetup allow it?
[03:32:51] <webchao> what do you mean with that anyway?
[03:32:58] <Cork> the problem is getting the file data to send
[03:33:01] <webchao> its some php thing?
[03:33:20] <Cork> $_FILES is the variable that contains uploaded files
[03:33:22] <webchao> oh file requests
[03:33:30] <Cork> post
[03:33:33] <webchao> i see, i am out then :)
[03:33:38] <Cork> not requests :)
[03:33:42] <webchao> right
[03:33:43] <webchao> words
[03:33:48] <synju> .. lol
[03:33:54] <webchao> you make a post request to send files
[03:34:04] <Cork> yes
[03:34:10] <Cork> but not just a request :)
[03:34:16] <webchao> right
[03:34:34] <synju> like I said, I couldn't get the $_FILES data, $.post doesn't send multipart etc data
[03:34:38] <Cork> synapt: the reason i didn't say anything before is cause it is a bit tricky to upload files through ajax
[03:34:40] <synju> not that I could see
[03:34:49] <webchao> sec, let me see how we did it
[03:34:50] <Cork> and you can't really just strap that onto a plugin for something
[03:34:54] <synju> like when you specify the encoding
[03:34:58] <Cork> you normally need to special build those
[03:35:19] <synju> :/
[03:35:24] <Cork> to send the files from a form you want to use the DataForm object
[03:35:32] <Cork> ?mdn DataForm
[03:35:33] <b-ot> Cork: Data form validation - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation
[03:35:40] <Cork> uh...
[03:35:43] <Cork> ?mdn FormData
[03:35:44] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[03:35:45] <synju> freaking deadline is today lol
[03:35:45] <synju> :'(
[03:35:46] <Cork> opps :)
[03:36:09] <webchao> oh, we use a fileupload plugin it seems
[03:36:10] <Cork> and it will only work in modern browsers
[03:36:14] <Cork> ah
[03:36:25] <Cork> that makes the matter a bit different
[03:36:42] <synju> all the plugins ive tried use formdata
[03:36:55] <Cork> ya
[03:37:05] <Cork> there is only formdata or filereader
[03:37:10] <synju> the issue I found is that the data is static before its edited..
[03:37:15] <synju> ie i cant edit it
[03:37:21] <synju> so it defeats the point
[03:37:36] <Cork> well you can add and remove data from the set
[03:37:56] <synju> hmm
[03:38:04] <synju> from formdata
[03:38:05] <synju> ?
[03:38:13] <Cork> from FormData ya
[03:38:19] <Cork> (check the link)
[03:38:47] <webchao> this one might be useful too https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload , if only to read the source of what they do
[03:39:25] <synju> k brb for a bit...
[03:44:19] <glothriel> Hiho, can i get some help with jcanvas here?
[03:48:36] <raj> is it me, or do I find myself always passing objects to call functions, and then extracting the vars I want...all because the function might be called by a jq event
[03:48:56] <raj> otherwise, I could just pass multiple arguments
[03:49:14] <raj> but that wouldn't accomodate the event
[03:49:22] <webchao> use arguments :P
[03:49:24] <Cork> can't say i recognize that no
[03:49:27] <webchao> slightly kidding
[03:51:14] <raj> Cork, so you pass multiple arguments to a function that might be an eventhandler?
[03:51:36] <Cork> raj: no
[03:51:45] <Cork> if a function is an event handler i don't pass extra data to it
[03:52:06] <raj> you make it self sufficient?
[03:52:50] <Cork> well if it is suppose to work from an event it must be able to work with what the event provides
[03:53:14] <raj> in the `event` argument?
[03:53:50] <Cork> raj: what do you mean?
[03:56:25] <raj> $('.thing').on('click', handleMe)   ... function handleMe(event){//you're saying the `event` object provides everything?}
[03:56:49] <Serdar> is it a bad idea to use a eMail adress for id or name attribute?
[03:56:50] <Cork> raj: no i say "this" should provide all that is needed
[03:57:07] <raj> interesting
[03:57:24] <systemfault> Serdar: Why  would you ever need to do that?
[03:57:32] <raj> `this` is just the clicked item though, no?
[03:57:32] <b-ot> raj: memorised ‚Äúthis`‚Äù.
[03:57:47] <Serdar> systemfault, to be unique
[03:58:11] <Serdar> and to remove it, if not needed anymore
[03:58:39] <systemfault> I'm not 100% sure that a @ is valid in an ID though
[03:59:24] <raj> dots will create issues with jq selectors as well
[03:59:43] <raj> Serdar, check out data-* attribute
[04:00:02] <systemfault> Serdar: From what I can read, it's invalid in HTML4 but permitted in HTML5
[04:00:20] <Cork> ya
[04:00:27] <Cork> but that is the standards
[04:00:38] <Cork> it has worked in browsers for all times more or less
[04:02:48] <webchao> today i found that its specified that a form with a single input field should take pressing 'enter' as submit
[04:03:02] <webchao> and the workaroudn is to create an invisible second input o_O
[04:03:37] <raj> Cork, do you change `this` from being the event target to something else?
[04:04:03] <Serdar> systemfault, the problem is not to be able to use it, but to find it
[04:04:32] <raj> Serdar, check out data-* attribute
[04:04:41] <raj> of html
[04:04:51] <Serdar> raj, ah, okay I will thanks
[04:04:59] <raj> and then check out jquery's .data()
[05:02:19] <pbodymind> ei... how can I detect a fullscreen change mode in jquery?
[05:03:03] <Cork> pbodymind: the same way you would do it in plain js
[05:03:40] <pbodymind> well.. i find many many webpages where the code is just old and wont run the lastest ff... any good resource on this? then
[05:03:51] <pbodymind> even some jquery plugins for fullscreen wont work
[05:03:51] <Cork> the event <prefix>fullscreenchange
[05:04:23] <pbodymind> TypeError: $(...).fullscreenchange is not a function |:
[05:04:33] <Cork> that isn't events
[05:04:36] <Cork> that is shorthands
[05:04:41] <Cork> .on or .bind
[05:04:43] <pbodymind> ups
[05:04:45] <pbodymind> ah ok
[05:05:25] <pbodymind> whats the difference between bind( and on(
[05:05:26] <pbodymind> ?
[05:05:38] <Cork> on can do delegate too
[05:05:51] <Cork> on == bind + delegate
[05:06:12] <Cork> what on does depends on the syntax you use when you call it
[05:06:29] <Cork> on(event, func) <-- bind
[05:06:35] <Cork> on(event, selector, func) <-- delegate
[05:11:26] <pbodymind> thanks
[05:13:35] <BernhardCron> hello, I have got a problem with "jQuery UI tooltips" and "colorbox" - is this the right place to ask a question?
[05:13:47] <Cork> yes
[05:14:00] <BernhardCron> wonderful
[05:14:03] <BernhardCron> so:
[05:14:28] <BernhardCron> Whenever i click on a image and colorbox opens, this image¬¥s caption (the text from the ‚Äûtitle atribute‚Äú) is hidden. It seems the whole <div> disappeared. When I click on ‚Äûnext image‚Äú the caption title of this image is shown.
[05:15:13] <BernhardCron> when i deactivate jquery ui the caption will be hown
[05:15:15] <BernhardCron> +s
[05:20:10] <kpl> Anyone tested if/how the Chosen jQuery plugin is able to follow jQuery UI themeroller styles?
[05:23:58] <pbodymind> Cork: it wont work.. :( http://jsfiddle.net/p3e7u/3/ it detects when I put on fullscreen.. but not when I quit.. using Escape
[05:24:34] <Cork> pbodymind: you didn't use the prefixed calls
[05:24:57] <pbodymind> wrong fiddler.. it was this one: http://jsfiddle.net/p3e7u/5/
[05:25:05] <pbodymind> prefixed calls? what do u mean?
[05:25:57] <Cork> TypeError: $(...).fullScreen is not a function
[05:26:09] <pbodymind> yes.. i think is about fiddle.. on my computer it works
[05:26:51] <pbodymind> but here the important is the binding.. it only detects when I go to fullscreen.. not when I cancel it...
[05:28:47] <pbodymind> oh wait.. i found this
[05:28:48] <pbodymind> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14549547/fullscreenchange-event-not-work
[05:29:15] <Cork> pbodymind: http://jsfiddle.net/p3e7u/8/
[05:29:34] <Cork> opps
[05:29:40] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/p3e7u/9/
[05:29:51] <pbodymind> thanks :)
[05:30:26] <Cork> pbodymind: also you can't trigger fullscreen from load or ready
[05:30:42] <pbodymind> ah ok
[05:30:55] <pbodymind> thats why it didnt work in fiddler.. im not doing it.. it was just for the example
[05:31:48] <Cork> pbodymind: http://jsfiddle.net/p3e7u/10/
[05:32:01] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/p3e7u/10/show/
[05:32:22] <pbodymind> Request for full-screen was denied because at least one of the document's containing iframes does not have an "allowfullscreen" attribute. -_-
[05:32:38] <Cork> ya, the iframe must allow fullscreen for it to work
[05:32:49] <pbodymind> perfect :D
[05:32:57] <Cork> thats why i linked the second example of the same page
[05:33:00] <pbodymind> let me test in all browsers
[05:33:32] <Cork> opps
[05:33:44] <Cork> pbodymind: requestFullScreen doesn't take an argument :)
[05:33:47] <pbodymind> in chrome it wont detect :$
[05:33:48] <Cork> so the true can be removed
[05:34:50] <pbodymind> i removed.. but in chrome it wont detect the change.. :| auch
[05:35:02] <pbodymind> im sure there is already some jquery plugin doing this the right way
[05:36:03] <pbodymind> u had an error: webkigfullscreenchange -> webkitfullscreenchange
[05:36:04] <pbodymind> ;)
[05:36:38] <pbodymind> now works :D
[05:36:39] <pbodymind> http://jsfiddle.net/cxJN5/1/
[05:36:59] <pbodymind> going to safari.. :
[05:37:02] <Cork> ugg
[05:37:34] <Cork> you made me go "WTF didn't that work" :D
[05:37:50] <pbodymind> safari sends me to visual studio debug mode.. muhahha.. nevermind I will make people install a decent browser
[05:38:18] <Cork> don't think safari supports fullscreen
[05:38:26] <Cork> not sure about ie either actually
[05:38:28] * Cork tests
[05:38:33] <pbodymind> it goes to fullscreen.. but coming out.. just crashes
[05:39:00] <Serdar> huh
[05:39:36] <pbodymind> and ie.. is just dead for me.. i dont want to support it.. i want to show a big text saying: "IE sucks.. so get a real browser..."
[05:40:04] <pbodymind> i wanted to forward everybody to firefox. but the client wont accept it.. |:
[05:42:58] <Cork> pbodymind: well http://fiddle.jshell.net/cxJN5/3/show/ works
[05:43:05] <Cork> it just dodn't look very good >_>
[05:43:11] <Cork> (in ie)
[05:44:38] <pbodymind> what did u change? in safari stopped workin
[05:45:15] <Cork> pbodymind: i just changed the names of the msRequestFullScreen to msRequestFullscreen
[05:45:34] <pbodymind> ah ok.. nevermind I had to close safari and open it again
[05:45:38] <Cork> as ie of course doesn't follow the name convention
[05:45:39] <pbodymind> -_- lame browsers
[05:50:10] <pbodymind> http://fiddle.jshell.net/cxJN5/8/show/ detecting if it is going to fullscreen.. or canceling
[05:54:27] <pbodymind> $( window ).on('fullscreenchange mozfullscreenchange webkitfullscreenchange',function() { -> this is being called 3 times in firefox.. how can I prevent this?
[05:55:29] <Cork> pbodymind: uh sorry i see i linked to http://fiddle.jshell.net/cxJN5/3/show/ instead of http://fiddle.jshell.net/cxJN5/8/show/ before :x
[05:57:44] <pbodymind> strange.. on my app it show 3 times firefox asking for fullscreen.. on the fiddle dont.. maybe im binding more than once?
[05:58:20] <Cork> pbodymind: ya, that or you have multiple elements you put fullscreen
[05:58:37] <agileadam> I'm trying to add some functionality to a site that uses jQuery. The site has as drag and drop interface where you drag boxes around. Is there a way for me to see what events are firing and what functions are called on the site as a result? Basically I need to add one more action when a user drags a box.
[06:22:39] <brauliobo> hello all, I need a .slidetoggle function that receives the state variable .toggle does. how can I do that?
[06:23:02] <Cork> state variable?
[06:23:17] <brauliobo> like .toggle(true) or .toggle(false)
[06:24:01] <brauliobo> state is conditional, not a simple toggle
[06:24:20] <Cork> doesn't look like there is one
[06:24:57] <Cork> so you would have to use slideShow and slideHide and write your own function
[06:25:21] <krambiorix> hi, how can i remove all this whitespace on the bottom of my dialog? http://imagebin.org/277125
[06:25:51] <brauliobo> oops, I see it works like toggle :P
[06:25:56] <brauliobo> just tested it
[06:26:03] <Cork> oooh undocumented
[06:26:04] <Cork> nice...
[06:26:06] <brauliobo> slideshow(true)
[06:26:10] <brauliobo> slidetoggle(true)
[06:26:48] <agileadam> Nevermind. Realized they're using UI and Sortable, so I can just bind an event listener to sortupdate or similar.
[06:31:58] <brauliobo> Cork: actually it didn't work...
[06:32:21] <brauliobo> i can't find a slideshow function
[06:32:32] <Cork> ?api slideShow
[06:32:32] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:32:38] <Cork> ?api slideDown
[06:32:38] <b-ot> Cork: .slideDown(): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[06:32:41] <Cork> opps :x
[06:32:46] <Cork> ?api slideUp
[06:32:46] <b-ot> Cork: .slideUp(): Hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[06:33:01] <brauliobo> oh, thanks
[06:33:28] <pixmin> hi, I'm having no trouble getting json via curl, but when trying the same url with jquery's getJSON it won't succeed and give me a status error, how do I find out what is going wrong?
[06:33:55] <Cork> pixmin: are you sending the correct mimetype?
[06:34:00] <Cork> application/json ?
[06:34:18] <Cork> also is it on the same domain?
[06:34:24] <Cork> else the browser will block it
[06:34:34] <pixmin> no, it's not onthe same domain
[06:34:43] <Cork> then there you go
[06:35:03] <Cork> unless the server have cors enabled for your domain, you can't do json requests to it
[06:35:23] <Cork> (Cross Origin Requests)
[06:36:02] <pixmin> Cork: ok...  why is the flickr example working? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ it's on a different domain, right?
[06:36:29] <Cork> pixmin: one of two reasons
[06:36:37] <Cork> 1. they use cors or 2. they use jsonp
[06:37:11] <pixmin> Cork: ok, so I need to tell the person generated the json on the server to use cors?
[06:37:15] <Cork> as fairly new ie's doesn't support cors most likely option 2
[06:37:25] <Cork> pixmin: that or jsonp yes
[06:37:57] <pixmin> Cork: ok, thanks a lot, I've been racking my brain and googling for an explanation for hours
[06:38:41] <DarsVaeda> I do "element.append('ﬂ');" in my script where ﬂ is a special german (and other languages probably) character but whatever I try html entity for example, it is still display with the wrong encoding (iso-8859-1)
[06:39:03] <DarsVaeda> displayed I mean...
[06:39:16] <Cork> DarsVaeda: is the page in utf8?
[06:39:20] <DarsVaeda> yes
[06:39:29] <Cork> and the javascript file?
[06:39:30] <voidbottle> hi guys
[06:39:35] <DarsVaeda> I saved the script as utf8 too
[06:40:12] <Cork> not sure then, should work fine
[06:40:20] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/68YML/
[06:40:37] <DarsVaeda> so it does on my local server...damn provider -.-
[06:41:04] <wessman> I am working on my responsive theme at www.snusmajoren.se, and a lot of mobile users cant add products to the cart. I.e. its not working in Chrome for any mobile user. Does anyone know why this could be happening?
[06:41:09] <Cork> DarsVaeda: make sure you set a meta tag in head
[06:41:39] <voidbottle> guys i need to append html to element that was clicked? what best way to do it? define a global varibale that stores current clicked object?
[06:41:42] <voidbottle> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7485333
[06:41:42] <Cork> DarsVaeda: a simple <meta charset="utf-8" /> should solve it
[06:41:55] <DarsVaeda> problem is I have that
[06:41:59] <Cork> if it is caused by the provider that is
[06:42:09] <Cork> DarsVaeda: do you have a link?
[06:42:24] <DarsVaeda> no sorry
[06:42:49] <Cork> check what encoding the browser things the page is in
[06:42:53] <DarsVaeda> I think the served js file is not utf8
[06:43:05] <Cork> if you encode them it should work
[06:43:30] <Cork> meaning &szlig;
[06:43:31] <DarsVaeda> shouldn't it work if I just use the html entity?
[06:43:49] <Cork> it should, that is what i meant
[06:44:02] <Cork> it should work if the js file is in the wrong encoding
[06:44:10] <Cork> (as js is always utf8)
[06:44:13] <krambiorix> anyone? how can i remove all this whitespace on the bottom of my dialog? http://imagebin.org/277125
[06:44:33] <Cork> krambiorix: check the elements that add the padding or what ever and remove it
[06:44:40] <Cork> it is hard to say what to do from an image
[06:45:42] <DarsVaeda> I don't know ... I just use two s instead ^^
[06:46:07] <Cork> DarsVaeda: do you have firefox (not sure how you check it in the other browsers)
[06:46:18] <DarsVaeda> yeah
[06:46:23] <DarsVaeda> I just found the problem...
[06:46:27] <Cork> right click the page and check page info
[06:46:37] <Cork> the encoding entry is what you need to check
[06:46:40] <DarsVaeda> strg+r doesn not clear the cache anymore
[06:46:48] <Cork> XD
[06:46:52] <Cork> classic!
[06:47:02] <DarsVaeda> I put the two s in and it is still wrong
[06:47:08] <DarsVaeda> the hell... -.-
[06:47:52] <voidbottle> hm
[06:47:54] <voidbottle> any help?
[06:48:23] <DarsVaeda> even worse, firebug display the correct file (the newer one) it is still not displayed right O_o
[06:48:42] <Cork> DarsVaeda: check the page encoding
[06:48:54] <Cork> voidbottle: what line is it you want this done in?
[06:49:22] <DarsVaeda> no I mean there are two s now in the file displayed in firebug in the net tab but on the page there is only one character...
[06:49:34] <Cork> ah
[06:49:39] <Cork> try clearing your cache
[06:50:19] <voidbottle> Cork, actually i don't know how to pass current element that was clicked to buildchild function. to be able do somethig like $(this).append(html)
[06:50:35] <Cork> voidbottle: pass it as an argument
[06:50:45] <Cork> it won't be "this" but it can be what ever you want
[06:51:11] <voidbottle> Cork, i was tried, but it don't works. let me show
[06:57:43] <voidbottle> Cork, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7485588 33 string
[06:57:55] <voidbottle> Cork, should i define a global variable? html ?
[06:57:59] <Cork> no
[06:58:14] <Cork> ugg... coffie is so horrible to read...
[06:58:42] <Cork> voidbottle: you need to return the value of html from the buildchild function
[06:59:02] <Cork> voidbottle: also you are async
[06:59:05] <voidbottle> Cork, it's my first expereince and coffee is sucks
[06:59:06] <Cork> so the code you have there won't work
[06:59:11] <Cork> ya
[06:59:30] <Cork> voidbottle: the code in success runs AFTER line 34
[06:59:46] <Cork> well actually after the rest of the function
[07:00:11] <voidbottle> Cork, yes, but there $this is different that element was clicked
[07:00:35] <Cork> voidbottle: 1. this is local to every function you call
[07:00:42] <Cork> you can't scope inherit it
[07:01:08] <Cork> 2. async code means in this case that line 33 can't EVER get code from the build function
[07:01:25] <Cork> cause it runs before the ajax call is made
[07:01:59] <agileadam> I'm running many stopwatch-like timers (hh:mm:ss) that are attached to several divs‚Ä¶ I need to keep track of the time for each div in local storage. Is there a "right" way to do this? I presume it's a bad idea to write to local storage every second for every timer‚Ä¶ ?
[07:02:30] <voidbottle> Cork, that mean only way i have
[07:02:39] <voidbottle> append html in buildchild
[07:02:45] <Cork> no
[07:02:56] <Cork> voidbottle: 1. return the content of html from buildchild
[07:03:01] <agileadam> I don't really care about seconds I guess‚Ä¶ so I could just write each timer's value to local storage every minute‚Ä¶ is that reasonable?
[07:03:15] <Cork> voidbottle: 2. move line 33 and 34 into the success callback
[07:03:36] <Cork> 3. do append(buildchild(data))
[07:04:21] <voidbottle> Cock in Javascript fucntion returns last value that was evaluated or i should write return?
[07:04:36] <Cork> voidbottle: no, but it does in coffie
[07:05:03] <Cork> (one of the reasons i hate coffie)
[07:05:08] <jstoner_> hello. i have a rather curious question. i have a small web application built on jquery using ajax and it works quite smooth so far. the only problem i encounter is if that web application is openend in two differents tab at the same time the browser no longer sends out any ajax requests (the firefox console said it did so but in the network view the requests stays 'unlit' and wireshark shows no network traffic).
[07:05:16] <jstoner_> if i close the second tab all 'pending' requests are issued in the first tab.
[07:05:21] <jstoner_> this only happends if the web application is opened in the _same_ browser in two different tabs. if the application is opened in two different browsers twice things work as expected. any ideas?
[07:05:40] <Cork> jstoner_: no essays please...
[07:05:55] <Cork> make the question easy to find without having to skim all that
[07:06:40] <jstoner_> tl;dr: ajax requests do not work if the web application is opened in two different tabs at the same time; if one is closed it works again
[07:06:47] <FutureTense> This snippet of code will change the background color of the submit button after its pressed and then submit.  However if I disable the button (commented out) then the button will be disabled and the form wont submt.  What am I doing wrong?   http://bpaste.net/show/lk1MoV7e20MZ0bJE1uuM/
[07:07:02] <Cork> jstoner_: sounds like a server limitation
[07:07:27] <jstoner_> Cork: nope. wireshark said the browser does no even send out a connection request.
[07:07:47] <jstoner_> i can reproduce this behaviour with firefox and chrome.
[07:07:54] <Cork> jstoner_: no clue then
[07:08:11] <jstoner_> as said, if i open the webapp once in firefox and once in chrome (but still at the same time) it works as excpected.
[07:08:15] <Cork> i have written several pages that do polls and it works just fine in multiple tabs
[07:08:43] <Cork> (i'm actually working in one right now)
[07:09:18] <Cork> jstoner_: there is a limit to the number of connections the browser will do to any given server
[07:09:24] <Cork> you might be hitting that i guess
[07:10:01] <voidbottle> fuck
[07:11:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Rofl: uit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[07:11:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4456438/how-can-i-pass-the-string-null-through-wsdl-soap-from-actionscript-3-to-a-co
[07:13:12] <jstoner_> Cork: this is just weird. it looks like only some of the ajax calls are affected, others work. do you know how to find out this connection limit?
[07:13:31] <Cork> jstoner_: the default is 8 i think
[07:13:39] <Cork> (per server cross domains)
[07:13:50] <Cork> sorry cross tabs
[07:14:32] <voidbottle> Cork, ok now buildchild returns html yay. But how to append it? if do this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7485881
[07:14:35] <jstoner_> Cork: well, that would explain this behavior (and well this would suck). do you know is there any way to circumvent this limitation?
[07:14:36] <Cork> so ya if you open 4 tabs and each of them want 3 concurrent connections you are in trouble
[07:14:42] <voidbottle> Cork, 37 string :(
[07:15:19] <Cork> jstoner_: as long as the connections arn't constant it should work, cause they will just be queued
[07:15:30] <Cork> jstoner_: and... websocket? :D
[07:16:03] <Cork> (got to love websocket =^^=)
[07:16:54] <voidbottle> Cork,  look at 37 string please
[07:17:13] <jstoner_> Cork: the connections are (have to be) constant :-/
[07:17:44] <Cork> voidbottle: var self = $(this); on line 29 and use self in the rest of the function
[07:17:52] <Cork> or at lest in the ajax callbacks
[07:18:12] <Cork> voidbottle: alternatively you can pass the context to $.ajax
[07:18:19] <Cork> and it will be this in the callbacks
[07:18:41] <Cork> context: this,
[07:19:21] <voidbottle> Cork, =* thank you so much!
[07:19:32] <Cork> np :)
[07:25:07] <voidbottle> Cork, cork! Holy tomatoes it's works :DDDD
[07:25:10] <voidbottle> =*
[07:25:13] <voidbottle> i love you man!
[07:26:34] <Fight> hei
[07:26:58] <Fight> any indonesian here
[07:31:22] <R1ck> Hi, I do a $("#element").append(stringWithHTML); but the HTML isn't showing, why could that be?
[07:32:15] <Fight> ?
[07:32:41] <Cork> R1ck: the #element most likely doesn't exist
[07:32:57] <Cork> R1ck: try console.log($('#element').length)
[07:35:12] <R1ck> Cork: hm, that returns 0
[07:35:19] <Cork> R1ck: there you go
[07:35:25] <relipse> Web Annoyance #579: <a href= links containing javascript code can not be opened in a new tab. my suggested solution: always put real urls in the href tag, use onclick for javascript binding
[07:35:47] <Cork> check the id of the element you want to append to and make sure you didn't misspell the id
[07:35:49] <R1ck> Cork: but I do have a <div id='element'> in my page
[07:36:11] <Cork> R1ck: it doesn't exist at that time at least
[07:40:58] <R1ck> Cork: nice. I had $(document).ready($("#element").append(stringWithHTML)); but that doesn't work,  with $(function() { $("#element").append(stringWithHTML) }); it does work..
[07:41:05] * hlve sings to all of you
[07:41:24] <Fight> hi
[07:42:01] <Cork> R1ck: ya, the first will try to use the return from append as a function
[07:42:04] <Cork> R1ck: and fail
[07:42:24] <hlve> I wonder
[07:42:33] <hlve> Is there any way to output the CSS in a var of an element?
[07:42:37] <R1ck> Cork: ah okay, thanks
[07:42:50] <Cork> hlve: the css in a var?
[07:43:05] <hlve> se.c
[07:43:13] <hlve> sec*, I need to mock this up to ask my question.
[07:43:16] <hlve> I suck at explaining things.
[07:43:19] <Cork> i'm off so...
[07:44:01] <airdem> foo.click(function()); is there a way to call function itself inside function?
[07:46:19] <airdem> hlve, variable.css('width');
[07:46:30] <hlve> no no.
[07:46:32] <airdem> will return the css width value
[07:46:46] <hlve> Let me reask my question when I finish this fiddle
[07:46:46] <hlve> lol
[07:55:38] <hlve> so basically - http://jsfiddle.net/LeMLc/3/
[07:56:06] <hlve> I'm trying to put an elements details, which I guess is going to be pretty complicated for css
[07:56:24] <Cork> airdem: yes it is possible, but NOT recommended cause it has been removed from newer versions of javascript
[07:56:40] <Cork> actually naming it should fix it :)
[07:56:57] <airdem> cork var foo = function() {} like this you mean?
[07:57:00] <Cork> airdem: .click(function cc() { cc() })
[07:57:04] <airdem> oh wow
[07:57:06] <airdem> nice :)
[07:57:21] <airdem> thats sweet, thank you
[07:57:29] <Cork> np
[07:59:04] <BillCriswell> The false sense of achievement I get from writing a regular expression is awesome.
[07:59:09] <Cork> hlve: ah you mean you want the computed style rules for the element?
[07:59:13] <airdem> Cork, care to tell me why it is NOT recommended?
[07:59:22] <hlve> yes
[07:59:22] <Cork> airdem: that one is ok
[07:59:44] <Cork> airdem: but you can use callee and a few other depricated variables
[07:59:56] <Cork> and that is NOT recommended (cause it is removed in strict mode)
[08:02:12] <hlve> Cork, is outputting the CSS not going to be a relatively easy task?
[08:02:53] <Cork> hlve: window.getComputedStyle() would give you the computed style for the element
[08:03:05] <Cork> if you want it as css it becomes more complicated
[08:06:43] <shwaiil> hi
[08:07:47] <hlve> hi
[08:08:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> good morning all
[08:09:12] <lenswipe> hey guys
[08:09:13] <lenswipe> anyone home?
[08:09:33] <lenswipe> I have a problem with jQuery UI. I'm calling .button() on a button and it's having no effect
[08:09:35] <lenswipe> even in chrome console
[08:09:40] <lenswipe> no errors, no exceptions - nothing
[08:09:48] <lenswipe> it doesn't even apply the jquery UI classes
[08:09:50] <lenswipe> anyone got any ideas?
[08:11:18] <shwaiil> Q: On Mobile Browsers, how to disable touch / scroll ? I'm using iscroll so, I need to remove the default behaviour of window scroll, this also may suggest I could easily overflow hidden, but I need to create a hack so that the URL bar is not visible after scrolling between range 0 < > 70px in the iscroll.
[08:11:27] <shwaiil> is it possible ? Thank you
[08:12:16] <shwaiil> for the moment I'll preventDefault on touchstart and touchmove
[08:17:57] <krambiorix> my input element's class names should be the property of my object , how can i do that? formdata.$(this).attr("class") = $(this).val();  ...
[08:20:31] <FutureTense> Can someone tell me why this code isnt working?  When I disable the button after clicking, the form wont submit
[08:20:32] <FutureTense> http://bpaste.net/show/9CNkrgcLZRHpl2x1loor/
[08:22:12] <Cork> FutureTense: var self = this; setTimeout(function() { $(self).prop('disabled' true); });
[08:22:27] <Cork> FutureTense: a disabled button disables the form in some browsers
[08:22:39] <FutureTense> so what does your code do?
[08:23:08] <Cork> it gives the browser a tick to submit the form, and then disables the button
[08:23:37] <Cork> FutureTense: a better option would actually be to use submit intead
[08:23:43] <Cork> *instead
[08:23:56] <FutureTense> What I'm trying to do is prevent double clicks
[08:24:35] <Cork> $('#saveStep').click(function () { => $('#saveStep').closest('form').submit(function () { $('#saveStep').prop('disabled', true); })
[08:24:49] <virtuz> $("#form").on("submit", function() { $("#submit").attr("disabled", "disabled") });
[08:25:08] <Cork> virtuz: no, attr isn't meant for that
[08:25:11] <Cork> and will break in ie
[08:25:38] <airdem> Cork, .click(function cc() { cc() }) cc wont be global right?
[08:26:01] <virtuz> no?
[08:26:20] <virtuz> oh damn. that was changed quite a while ago huh.
[08:27:14] <FutureTense> Cork: is that => supposed to be there?
[08:27:16] <Cork> airdem: no
[08:27:16] <Cork> airdem: the name will only exist inside the function
[08:27:37] <Cork> FutureTense: no it is meant to point at what you should change
[08:27:48] <FutureTense> lol, I thought it looked funny
[08:28:04] <Cork> virtuz: yes 1.4 or 1.5
[08:28:19] <virtuz> lol. should definitely read release notes.
[08:28:40] <Cork> virtuz: basically attr was split into prop and attr
[08:28:59] <Cork> virtuz: where attr is get/setAttribute and prop is properties of the dom element
[08:29:00] <airdem> function(foo) {} <-- whats the common way to check if foo is set or not?
[08:29:15] <Cork> airdem: if(foo)
[08:29:22] <michelem> hello folks
[08:29:24] <Cork> or if(foo !== undefined)
[08:29:35] <virtuz> Cork: ok, that makes sense. thanks for the heads up
[08:30:02] <airdem> function(foo) {var foo = foo !== undefined ? foo : this.value;} is this legit in js?
[08:30:18] <Cork> airdem: eh...
[08:30:20] <michelem> I suppose this is FAQ, but havent found the answer. When I $.ajax() to my session-auth API, everything works. When I $.post() instead, I get auth required. Why is session information not sent with the latter?
[08:30:32] <Cork> airdem: just do foo = foo || this.value;
[08:30:38] <Cork> and no var
[08:30:49] <Cork> foo is already defined in the arguments list
[08:30:50] <airdem> Cork, thanks for teaching
[08:31:33] <Cork> michelem: it should be
[08:31:47] <Cork> michelem: if you by "session information" mean cookies that is
[08:33:09] <lenswipe> I have a problem with jQuery UI. I'm calling .button() on a button and it's having no effect
[08:33:13] <lenswipe> even in chrome console
[08:33:16] <lenswipe> no errors, no exceptions - nothing
[08:33:20] <lenswipe> it doesn't even apply the jquery UI classes
[08:33:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> lenswipe: you have exmaple
[08:33:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> i cna see
[08:33:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> a jsfiddle perhaps
[08:33:42] <lenswipe> Rohan_Bhangui, I put an example together and it seems to work
[08:33:48] <lenswipe> it works in a plain exaple.
[08:33:51] <FutureTense> Cork, that first one works great... however I'm having some issues with the 2nd as I'm using MVC
[08:33:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[08:33:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> then try to duplicate your problem
[08:34:02] * lenswipe puts Cork in the water
[08:34:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> use styling and stuff
[08:34:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> and tell me what you get
[08:34:18] <Cork> FutureTense: second?
[08:34:20] <michelem> thanks cork, I'll try to look into it
[08:34:28] <lenswipe> Rohan_Bhangui, styling isn't the issue - its like jQuery UI isn't even there
[08:34:34] <lenswipe> I guess its just specific to my application :(
[08:34:38] <Cork> FutureTense: it was just one change
[08:34:44] <FutureTense> using the "closest" method
[08:34:47] <Cork> ah
[08:35:10] <Cork> FutureTense: that was just my way of expressing "bind the event listener on the form for the button"
[08:36:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> lenswipe: what version of juqery and jquery ui are you usin
[08:36:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> *using
[08:37:09] <lenswipe> Rohan_Bhangui, jQuery v 1.10.2 and jQuery UI v 1.10.3
[08:37:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmmmmm
[08:38:04] <tgodar> have a form with a submit handler that launches a model dialog, for the "continue" button of that dialog I use .off to remove the handler and set a new one with .on, I think call submit again, on that submit it seems like both handlers fire rather than just the one I want... that sound familiar?
[08:39:16] <tgodar> maybe the original event propagation?
[08:39:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> lenswipe: have you checked your css is linked
[08:39:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> no errors in console
[08:40:12] <airdem> my select has already a change function assigned to it. is there a way to add another callback to it?
[08:40:21] <lenswipe> Rohan_Bhangui, yep - it is
[08:40:54] <airdem> that gets fired after change() has finished
[08:41:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: you could write your code in change in one function and the code that you want in callback in second function
[08:41:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then execute in change event the first function and then second
[08:42:17] <airdem> will select.change().add(callback()); also work?
[08:43:24] <airdem> oh no that was nonsense i believe :P
[08:43:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm
[08:44:15] <airdem> it gets called before change() finishes
[08:44:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7676707/2280670
[08:44:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> look at how the toggle is done
[08:45:23] <airdem> Rohan_Bhangui, not what im looking for though, thank you
[08:45:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> you wanted a callback right?
[08:46:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: then what are you looking for
[08:46:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> lenswipe: you said the styling of button is not working or
[08:46:37] <lenswipe> correct
[08:46:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> the jquery ui stuff itself (the js) is not working
[08:46:44] <lenswipe> yeah
[08:46:49] <lenswipe> its like the method isn't even there
[08:46:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> so jquery ui script is working
[08:46:53] <lenswipe> but chrome console throwns no nerror
[08:47:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> are you using only jquery ui css for styling?
[08:48:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> lenswipe: do me a favour
[08:48:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> run jquery ui 1.8.9
[08:48:46] <airdem> Rohan_Bhangui, i want to run code after the change event has finished
[08:48:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[08:48:54] <airdem> but not every time
[08:49:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> well then you need to create a boolean var that will test for the conditions you wanna meet
[08:49:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> but the callback thats how yo udo it
[08:49:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> chaining
[08:49:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> lenswipe: run jquery ui 1.8.5 on jquery 1.10.x
[08:49:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> it should work
[08:51:30] <lenswipe> Rohan_Bhangui, the two versions of jquery work perfectly together on their own. It's likely an issue witgh my application - I'll look into it myself, thanks for you help thoughu.
[08:54:48] <Newbie_3D> hey! the auto click on javascript worked only in IE ! will it work on other browser ( chrome or firefox ) if i use Jquery ?
[08:58:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> Newbie_3D: why not try
[08:58:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[09:00:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta , grafi : mroning
[09:00:12] <grafi> dude its like 6pm
[09:01:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[09:01:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> 12 here
[09:01:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> pm
[09:01:37] <Newbie_3D> Rohan_Bhangui: i don't know anything about Jquery coding! starting learning it depend on my Question answer : no or yes
[09:01:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> Newbie_3D: then what do you mean by autoclick
[09:02:22] <Newbie_3D> Rohan_Bhangui: make the script autimatically click an element < document.getElementById('someid').click()>
[09:02:49] <shoky> that works in chrome and FF too
[09:04:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: can he not use trigger
[09:04:34] <shoky> Rohan_Bhangui: who said he can't?
[09:04:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[09:04:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[09:04:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> `api trigger @ Newbie_3D
[09:04:52] <b-ot> Newbie_3D: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[09:05:19] <shoky> though, trigger('click') won't always really trigger a native .click() call
[09:05:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> Newbie_3D: also use $("#someid") instead of document.getElementById('someid')
[09:08:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> newyas im out
[09:23:41] <BillCriswell> Ugh, Excel is killing me.
[09:25:59] <maxmoore14> can someone help me with taphold/tap event problems?
[09:31:20] <maxmoore14> http://jsbin.com/OQeCevAD/1/
[09:32:20] <maxmoore14> I've got a var to detect when taphold has been triggered
[09:32:47] <maxmoore14> I also have preventDefault() and stopImmediatePropagation() called to prevent event bubbling
[09:33:05] <maxmoore14> works great on a PC (no touch events)
[09:33:33] <maxmoore14> on a touch device, the tap event is still getting triggered
[09:33:38] <maxmoore14> no idea why
[09:39:30] <FutureTense> Cork, thanks for your help. I made some progress.  One question about "closest"
[09:39:31] <maxmoore14> slightly updated - http://jsbin.com/OQeCevAD/2/edit?js
[09:39:43] <FutureTense> --->  $('input[type="submit"]').closest('form').submit(function () {
[09:39:50] <maxmoore14> this is now "sometimes" working
[09:40:01] <FutureTense> Is there a way to find the element that caused the form to submit?
[09:40:36] <maxmoore14> I'm wondering whether this is a rare case where I am better off using click instead of tap?
[09:43:41] <krambiorix> my input element's class names should be the property of my object , how can i do that? formdata.$(this).attr("class") = $(this).val();  ...
[09:45:26] <shoky> krambiorix: i suppose you want bracket notation.. formdata[key] = value;
[09:45:37] <Newbie_3D> b-ot: shoky : i'm testing trigger() in jsfiddle.net/ what i'm i missing here ! http://jsfiddle.net/#run&togetherjs=3UxPAqSzKe ?
[09:45:37] <b-ot> Newbie_3D: without a doubt.
[09:46:41] <krambiorix> shoky thanks!
[09:47:15] <Newbie_3D> thanks :)
[09:55:17] <AntelopeSalad> what's the standard way to memoize an event handler?
[09:55:51] <AntelopeSalad> right now i'm just unbinding an event and then rebinding it but that seems crippled, is there a jquery shortcut way of saying "hey, only bind this event once no matter how many times you run me"?
[09:58:55] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: you could namespace your events
[09:59:09] <Cork> .on('click.my-special-events', func)
[09:59:23] <Cork> .off('.my-special-events').on(...)
[09:59:33] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: but ya, you should make sure you only do it once instead
[09:59:44] <AntelopeSalad> Cork: i think the problem i'm having is...
[09:59:46] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: a simple way to do that is to use delegated event listeners
[09:59:58] <AntelopeSalad> these events need to run a callback from some other function
[10:00:10] <AntelopeSalad> how can i declare it outside of the function calling it?
[10:00:20] <Cork> that wasn't what i meant
[10:01:00] <Cork> $('parent of all the elements').on('event', 'selector that matches the elements based on the parent, func)
[10:01:12] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: and then just bind it once and let it handle all of it
[10:02:20] <AntelopeSalad> Cork: hmm, would the full context help? because i'm not sure how the "selector that matches..." would even apply here
[10:03:37] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: sure
[10:03:58] <Cork> context always helps
[10:04:02] <AntelopeSalad> Cork: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7488855
[10:04:16] <AntelopeSalad> the situation is i'm adding a custom modal dialog for the pagedown (markdown) editor
[10:04:44] <AntelopeSalad> it's all working but the click events are getting executed multiple times, the # of times depends on how many times you opened and closed the dialog
[10:04:54] <AntelopeSalad> so it starts off doing it once, then it does it 3, 6, 10, 15 etc.. times
[10:05:17] <AntelopeSalad> everytime that hook gets ran it rebinds a new event i guess
[10:05:25] <AntelopeSalad> and then it ends up executing it n times
[10:06:36] <AntelopeSalad> so for now what i did was just unbind the event (lines 11/12) and that solves the issue but it seems like a dumb hack
[10:07:40] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: ya, move the event listener out of the hooks callback
[10:07:53] <Cork> and make it static (up along side the file_url variable)
[10:07:58] <AntelopeSalad> but the click events need to do something with callback()
[10:08:04] <AntelopeSalad> how can i pass that in?
[10:08:15] <Cork> ah, there
[10:08:24] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: so store the callback variable
[10:08:44] <Cork> (it is what you do now anyway, you just do it through scoping)
[10:09:04] <AntelopeSalad> hmm, can you fork+show that to me? i don't understand
[10:09:26] <Cork> for future notes, please use a tool that is easy to update
[10:09:31] <Cork> like jsfiddle or jsbin
[10:11:29] <AntelopeSalad> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/uKwH7/
[10:12:12] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: http://jsfiddle.net/9Gq5m/
[10:13:22] <AntelopeSalad> Cork: hmm, i need to digest that for a few
[10:13:53] <AntelopeSalad> i think it makes sense
[10:14:41] <Cork> the reseting of action should make it safer then the old one actually
[10:14:51] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: another option would be to use .once
[10:15:04] <Cork> but i don't like adding and removing events all the time
[10:15:10] <Cork> ?api once
[10:15:10] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[10:15:14] <Cork> ?api one
[10:15:15] <b-ot> Cork: .one(): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[10:15:22] <AntelopeSalad> does .once handle the unbind/rebind under the hood?
[10:15:28] <Cork> no
[10:15:42] <Cork> it just fire once and then remove it self
[10:15:48] <Cork> you can still bind multiple ones
[10:15:54] <AntelopeSalad> yeah but that's basically the same thing in the end
[10:16:01] <AntelopeSalad> it binds it, does it, then unbinds it?
[10:16:09] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: that is a standard behavior of unobstructive js
[10:16:28] <AntelopeSalad> with your method it seems like it's more efficient?
[10:16:44] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: it does the same as var a =function() { .unbind(a); }; bind(a)
[10:16:51] <AntelopeSalad> the handler is only setup once and then what it does depends on the result of action
[10:17:04] <Cork> well it doesn't modify the dom as much, and ya that will help performance
[10:17:11] <Cork> not much for simple pages though
[10:17:22] <Cork> but it helps readability too, and that is a bigger gain in my book
[10:17:39] <AntelopeSalad> what's with the early return btw?
[10:17:56] <AntelopeSalad> wouldn't that cause unexpected issues?
[10:17:57] <Cork> it check if there callback has been reset
[10:18:04] <Cork> and if it has it just doesn't do anything
[10:18:09] <Cork> no
[10:18:14] <AntelopeSalad> if there's no action then it'll return early, but that means things like hiding the modal won't occur?
[10:18:34] <AntelopeSalad> example: check line 16 out in the submit handler
[10:18:43] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: well ya, but the action basically can't happen
[10:19:03] <AntelopeSalad> if line 16 never happens then the modal will never disappear
[10:19:06] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: it is just a check so it doesn't call the handler after it's been used
[10:19:29] <AntelopeSalad> ok, let me hook it up to see what happens, that might be easier
[10:19:34] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: ya, and line 11 and 20 won't ever happen unless line 29 doesn't happen
[10:19:45] <Cork> or line 13 and 22 has happened
[10:19:55] <Cork> and those tow only happens if you actually close the dialog
[10:20:15] <Cork> so the if is just a safely check
[10:21:06] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: without the if case you could either call action when it is undefined
[10:21:12] <Cork> and that could just crash
[10:21:23] <Cork> or run action twice on the same upload
[10:21:29] <AntelopeSalad> it errors out with object is not a function btw
[10:21:50] <Cork> ouch
[10:21:50] <Cork> sorry
[10:22:06] <Cork> AntelopeSalad: http://jsfiddle.net/9Gq5m/1/
[10:22:22] <Cork> forgot to change the name when i added the safety check :)
[10:23:29] <AntelopeSalad> ah good eye
[10:23:34] <AntelopeSalad> it would have taken me a while to find that
[10:24:04] <AntelopeSalad> it seems to work now, no errors and each handler only gets ran once per event no matter how many times you ran it
[10:24:06] <AntelopeSalad> thanks a lot
[10:24:16] <Cork> yw
[10:42:02] <Bloomberg> .
[10:42:09] <Bloomberg> Guys!!
[10:42:41] <Bloomberg> How can I to pass more than one var with   :::   my_function('var1', 'var2');
[10:43:10] <Cork> Bloomberg: you are
[10:43:33] <Bloomberg> what?
[10:43:48] <Cork> Bloomberg: you are passing two two vars so 2 > 1
[10:44:29] <Cork> Bloomberg: if you meant something else it would help with some more context for the question
[10:50:18] <Acrack> hello can someone tell me why i have undefined as first value in my array please ?
[10:50:18] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/MRKNs/1/
[10:50:47] <Cork> Acrack: cause you set the index
[10:50:59] <Cork> Acrack: the first value you use is 1 so 0 will be empty
[10:51:19] <Cork> simplest option is to either use .push instead
[10:51:21] <Cork> or use an object
[10:51:26] <Acrack> but if i use push
[10:51:35] <Acrack> it wont replace existing ids
[10:51:48] <Acrack> it ll look like [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1] etc
[10:52:11] <Acrack> i got this code running each time i do a specific actions
[10:52:23] <Acrack> it get all ids selected and make an array
[10:52:25] <Serdar> I got a question about this modal window from jquery
[10:52:48] <Serdar> is it possible to get the browser Icon blinking when modual window appear?
[10:52:49] <Cork> Acrack: are you ok with jquery dependency?
[10:53:08] <Acrack> ?
[10:53:14] <Acrack> i guess not
[10:53:18] <Serdar> and second is it possible to get more than one modual windows than one?
[10:53:21] <Acrack> or maybe i don't understand what you mean ^^
[10:53:31] <Cork> $.inArray()
[10:53:35] <Cork> ?api inarray
[10:53:35] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[10:53:37] <ciss> hi
[10:53:41] <Cork> ?api jquery.inarray
[10:53:41] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.inArray(): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[10:53:53] <Acrack> ok lemme try it
[10:54:00] <BillCriswell> Serdar: Not sure about blinking. You can alter the title with document.title = 'Some New Shit (2)";
[10:54:25] <Cork> Acrack: alternatively you can use indexOf, but it doens't support ie8 or older
[10:54:36] <Serdar> BillCriswell, yeah I know, but this will only be seen when the window is active :/
[10:55:13] <Cork> Serdar: what the browser does with it's ui is not controllable by the website
[10:55:14] <BillCriswell> Serdar: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/notifications/quick/ might be useful?
[10:56:06] <Serdar> Cork, I know that with window.open the new window appear or is blinking
[10:56:23] <ciss> i'm using multiple versions of jquery simultaneously (don't ask). with one instance i've bound a handler to the document's resize event. unfortunately the handler gets called twice, each time with vastly different results: on the first call, .offset().top for a particular element (at the top of the viewport) returns only a small value, while the second time the value seems to equal a total offset (i'm using overflow:hidden on a container element)
[10:56:27] <BillCriswell> Sure there's something a little more updated but using the Notifications API may be your only chance of getting the users attention if the window doesn't have focus.
[10:56:28] <Cork> Serdar: if the browsers config let it create windows ya
[10:56:31] <Serdar> but if I want to use modal window it is not trivial
[10:56:44] <Cork> Serdar: else it just opens a new tab with no ui information (if the browser so chooses)
[10:57:13] <BillCriswell> Serdar: http://www.dangercove.com/html5-notifications/ wee
[10:57:14] <Cork> Serdar: and modal window.open windows are only modal if the browser allows it
[10:57:17] <Cork> most don't
[10:57:59] <Cork> Serdar: window.open has been around for ages, and has been abused A LOT, so much of it has been disabled or prefed off
[10:58:38] <BillCriswell> Damn porno sites ruined popups.
[10:58:55] <ciss> any idea how i can track this down or handle it properly? i require the offset to readjust the page offset
[10:59:51] <Serdar> I will take a look at the notification tipps from bill. but I need some kind of notification, otherwise no one will accept/reject what is offered within the popup :/
[10:59:52] <Acrack> Cork: Thanks mate :)
[11:00:09] <maxmoore14> 2 questions... anyone know the expected release date of 1.4-final?
[11:00:20] <Acrack> Cork: i did this tho : $.inArray($(this).data('friend-id'), friendIds) === -1     i don't know if it is the best way to check if it exists in array
[11:00:34] <Cork> maxmahem: 1.4?!?
[11:00:41] <Cork> *maxmoore14:
[11:00:45] <maxmoore14> and... do you think it is possible to integrate the touch events of 1.4 into 1.3
[11:00:50] <Cork> maxmoore14: i think your asking in the wrong channel
[11:00:59] <maxmoore14> Cork: jquery mobile
[11:01:02] <Cork> ah
[11:01:35] <Cork> Acrack: it is
[11:01:55] <Xal_> Is there an easy way to have javascript/jquery call up a separate file that contains the header/nav bar/footer/everything outside of the content pane and insert it around the contents of the present page? Basically I'm trying to replicate asp.net masterpages if anyone is familiar with them.
[11:01:55] <Cork> Acrack: alternatively you can use an object and solve it similarly
[11:03:02] <nitrospectide> Instead of two different statements with the same function but different selectors, how can I combine multiple selectors with an OR in a single statement?
[11:03:23] <BillCriswell> nitrospectide: $('.foo, .bar') ?
[11:03:41] <Cork> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/MRKNs/3/
[11:03:47] <Bloomberg> Cork: Is that I have a problem with my jquery function
[11:04:17] <Cork> Bloomberg: ok?
[11:04:18] <BillCriswell> nitrospectide: Think you can do like $('.foo').add('.bar') as well.
[11:04:41] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/L5ZwG/
[11:04:41] <Cork> you can
[11:04:42] <Bloomberg> That is
[11:05:14] <Cork> Bloomberg: having ready inside a function makes no sense
[11:05:14] <Acrack> Cork: thanks :)
[11:05:32] <Cork> Acrack: warning though Object.keys is quite new too
[11:05:46] <Acrack> oh value is "true"
[11:05:46] <Acrack> ^^
[11:06:06] <Cork> Acrack: ya, that is the smallest value i could think of to store :)
[11:06:06] <Serdar> BillCriswell, not supported by IE10+ or FF only Chrome :(
[11:06:08] <nitrospectide> BillCriswell: Thanks. Still learning the ropes on this :)
[11:06:12] <Cork> the key is all that is of interest
[11:06:21] <Bloomberg> Cork: The problem is the first time I send the data and works ok, but I believe that does a loop
[11:06:26] <Acrack> hum
[11:06:31] <Bloomberg> because of there so on doesn't change
[11:06:34] <BillCriswell> Serdar: Killer lame.
[11:06:53] <Cork> Bloomberg: try removing ready inside onloadContactTable and it might help a bit
[11:07:09] <BillCriswell> Serdar: I think just a setInterval() while changing the title might be your only hope there.
[11:07:31] <Cork> Acrack: Object.keys(obj) will return an array of the keys
[11:07:42] <Acrack> Cork: at the end i have to play with another array that look like this : [ '1', '2', '50' ]
[11:07:48] <Cork> though again doesn't work in ie8
[11:07:50] <Z_A_M> How come my alert() doesn't work in chrome but it works with this jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/z68qk/
[11:07:55] <Acrack> :s
[11:08:05] <Z_A_M> Seems like such a simple problem, but I can't identify it.
[11:08:11] <Serdar> BillCriswell, I gues I will be stuck at popup :/
[11:08:46] <Cork> Z_A_M: you mean the fiddle doesn't work in chrome or...?
[11:08:52] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/L5ZwG/1/
[11:09:06] <Cork> fiddle is a webpage, it doesn't work without a browser :)
[11:09:08] <Bloomberg> Cork:The problem is here because always send the same data
[11:09:11] <Bloomberg> you see some wrong?
[11:09:30] <Z_A_M> Cork: Sorry I should have specified. The fiddle works in chrome, but it doesn't work the page I am hosting locally.
[11:09:44] <Z_A_M> Cork: which is also in Chrome
[11:10:05] <Cork> Z_A_M: http://jsfiddle.net/z68qk/1/ ?
[11:10:17] <Cork> Z_A_M: you prob forgot the ready listener
[11:10:39] <Cork> jsfiddle defaults to onload
[11:11:23] <Cork> Bloomberg: hard to say from that code
[11:11:53] <Cork> Bloomberg: have you checked so the different .val()/text() returns the values you expect?
[11:12:20] <Cork> Bloomberg: side note, prop doesn't take 'disabled' for the disabled property
[11:12:24] <Cork> it takes true or false
[11:12:58] <Cork> sure the string works cause it is truthy
[11:12:58] <Bloomberg> Cork:But that like this is working ok
[11:13:05] <Z_A_M> Cork: I know what you mean, but I'm not sure how to implement that solution to be honest.
[11:13:29] <Cork> js> if('disabled') { print('yes it is'); }
[11:13:45] <Cork> <_<
[11:13:50] * Cork pokes b-ot
[11:13:54] <Bloomberg> Cork: how can I clean the vars in the functions
[11:13:59] <jrajav> Cork: Wait what? .prop doesn't accept a string? Are you certain?
[11:14:09] <jrajav> I thought disabled="disabled" was required for older IE's
[11:14:10] <nitrospectide> If I am testing for an attribute value, and that value has [] brackets in it, then how do I escape those, since the containing delimiter for an attribute test is the same characters?
[11:14:11] <Cork> jrajav: for disabled; yes
[11:14:19] <Cork> jrajav: that is attributes
[11:14:23] <Cork> not properties
[11:14:41] <Cork> attr('disabled', 'disabled') is correct
[11:14:43] <Cork> and needed
[11:14:59] <Cork> prop('disabled', true) is for properties
[11:15:12] <Cork> Bloomberg: there is no vars...
[11:15:18] <Cork> so there is nothing to clear
[11:15:36] <Cork> you don't save anything you do dom selection every time you want to do something
[11:15:44] <Cork> (a good way to kill performance)
[11:15:48] <Bloomberg> what you think is heppening
[11:15:50] <Bloomberg> ha*
[11:16:02] <Cork> impossible to say without seeing what you are trying to do
[11:16:19] <Bloomberg> I just to try alert the vars inside to call the onloadContactTable() function
[11:16:21] <Cork> one guess it that you might have more then one element or something
[11:16:36] <Cork> Bloomberg: well the elements would help
[11:16:52] <Bloomberg> And works ok, change the values when I change the options
[11:17:15] <Bloomberg> But if I call the function in the console always send the same params
[11:17:23] <jedimind> Bloomberg setup a test case
[11:17:32] <jedimind> i cant beleive we have to ask you to do that every. single. day.
[11:20:22] <Z_A_M> Cork: Thanks that fixed it. I appreciate the help.
[11:20:41] <Cork> Z_A_M: yw
[11:21:54] <BillCriswell> nitrospectide: $('.foo[name="somename[]"]')
[11:22:40] <BillCriswell> nitrospectide: You could even escape the [] without the quotes like.. name=somename\[\]... harder to read in my opinion though.
[11:23:03] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').filter(function(){ return this.name === 'somename[]' }); as well.
[11:23:11] <jrajav> Whooot
[11:23:15] <jrajav> Got Kit Kat
[11:23:16] <jrajav> Got GEL
[11:23:18] <jrajav> Life is good
[11:23:25] <BillCriswell> I just finished a Kit Kat.
[11:23:50] <jrajav> I suddenly feel the urge to go purchase a Kit Kat(tm) bar
[11:23:54] <BillCriswell> I piss all my friends off when I eat them cause I chomp in instead of breaking it into peices.
[11:24:13] <Cork> XD
[11:24:31] <Cork> "what a waste!"? :D
[11:24:44] <BillCriswell> Haha, they just call me an animal.
[11:24:50] <Cork> lol
[11:29:01] <HowardwLo> Hi, how would you guys call an ajax after a modal has been revealed?
[11:30:21] <BillCriswell> HowardwLo: Like a ui dialog?
[11:30:24] <Cork> HowardwLo: normally from a callback if it is a plugin
[11:30:36] <Cork> HowardwLo: or just through calling the function
[11:30:39] <nitrospectide> BillCriswell: Thanks!
[11:30:47] <BillCriswell> nitrospectide: No problem.
[11:31:06] <BillCriswell> HowardwLo: If it's jQuery UI: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-open
[11:32:40] <Bloomberg> Cork: I believe i has found the mistake
[11:32:48] <Bloomberg> But I don't know how can I fix it
[11:32:59] <Bloomberg> I'm working with the jtable plugin for jquery
[11:33:08] <HowardwLo> BillCriswell: Its an ajaxified button. If its the users first time hitting the button, it modal popup's an explanation. I would like the ajax to fire after the popup
[11:33:14] <Bloomberg> this plugin has a options is " destroy "
[11:33:23] <Bloomberg> Compeletely removes table from it's container.
[11:33:36] <Bloomberg> http://www.jtable.org/apireference#met-destroy
[11:33:47] <Bloomberg> But now I don't know where can I call it
[11:33:57] <HowardwLo> Cork: What would be the best way to call the ajax? At modal close? I was under the impression if ajax and modal are simultaneous, the ajax might occur first, thereby altering the modal's parameters
[11:34:01] <BillCriswell> HowardwLo: That doesn't help.
[11:34:31] <Cork> HowardwLo: ajax always goes after your code is done
[11:34:56] <Cork> HowardwLo: it won't ever run before the current code has ended, and the response will happen a little later
[11:35:06] <Cork> (depending on the network speed)
[11:35:24] <HowardwLo> Cork: Hmm‚Ä¶ then somehow my ajax isn't running when the modal pops up
[11:35:45] <HowardwLo> Cork: Do you use foundation?
[11:35:54] <Cork> no
[11:36:08] <Cork> i usually just use jquery
[11:36:15] <Cork> sometimes part of jquery ui
[11:36:53] <BillCriswell> HowardwLo: Are you using "Reveal?"
[11:37:08] <HowardwLo> BillCriswell: Yes I am
[11:37:21] <inv3nt0r> Hi everyone. Can anyone here suggest a method to automatically add an accordion-type toggle to elements which are over a given height? Basically add a plus button *only* if a given div is over a certain height.
[11:37:37] <HowardwLo> BillCriswell: Specifically, "data-reveal-id"
[11:37:49] <HowardwLo> BillCriswell: I think thats a foundation thing, though
[11:38:10] <Cork> inv3nt0r: you can't really do that automatically
[11:38:41] <Cork> inv3nt0r: you could set the element to have a max-height, and then on page load loop over them and show a plus sign if it is clipped
[11:39:00] <Cork> inv3nt0r: but you can't how content based on if an element has overflow
[11:39:06] <Cork> how==show
[11:39:53] <inv3nt0r> Cork: That is what I was thinking... How would I detect clipping?
[11:40:35] <Cork> $(this).prop('scrollHeight') > $(this).height()
[11:41:42] <inv3nt0r> Cork: Thanks!
[11:41:47] <BillCriswell> It woudl be something along the lines of $('#someModal').foundation('reveal', { open: function(){  /* I run when the modal is opened */ }});
[11:41:59] * grafi runs
[11:42:14] * grafi asks BillCriswell where am I supposed to run to?
[11:42:14] <HowardwLo> BillCriswell: And the modal will be displayed with pre-AJAX data?
[11:42:41] <BillCriswell> grafi: Stage left!
[11:42:55] <BillCriswell> HowardwLo: I dunno.
[11:43:02] <BillCriswell> Just looking at the documentation.
[11:43:11] <BillCriswell> Thinking I should learn one of these fancy frameworks.
[11:43:22] <grafi> fancy whatworks?
[11:43:33] <grafi> the answer is nothing
[11:43:36] <grafi> nothing works
[11:43:42] <BillCriswell> grafi: haha.
[11:44:05] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with jtable jquery plugin?
[11:44:25] <grafi> nope
[11:44:27] <Bloomberg> I need to set the destroy param but doesn't works
[11:44:39] <grafi> why not?
[11:46:06] <Bloomberg> If I set it before to start the function show me problem
[11:46:31] <Bloomberg> and if I set it after the function doesn't happen nothing
[11:47:36] <BillCriswell> This looks pretty snazzy: http://semantic-ui.com/
[11:48:20] <ErusPrime> I'm trying to use themeroller to make a neat little page to display some coupons on my website in a meaningful manner. I use a CRM and i don't have access to the raw code. Basically, I have to put everything on one page without calling external files. using the widgets from http://jqueryui.com/demos/ The main problem I'm having is getting the dialog box to open when placed inside a vertical tab.
[11:48:55] <ErusPrime> Can someone help me muddle this together?
[11:49:11] <grafi> BillCriswell its really not though
[11:49:59] <BillCriswell> grafi: More of a pessimist than me haha.
[11:50:25] <grafi> i tried it
[11:50:39] <BillCriswell> What didn't you like about it?
[11:50:48] <ravenzz> BillCriswell "ui three column grid" this is not semantic at all
[11:51:01] <ravenzz> or this  <span class="right">
[11:51:19] <morenac> Hi all -- Was wondering how simple it would be to extend droppable/draggable so that it works with multiple "scopes". By default, it only accepts the first element that has the scope. It'd be great if it accepted all elements with the same scope..
[11:52:06] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: I always dislike classes like that till I need them haha.
[11:52:09] <b-ot> Cork: yes it is
[11:52:20] <Cork> <_<
[11:52:48] <Cork> b-ot: ... that was 40 mins ago...
[11:52:52] <Cork> >_<
[11:52:54] <grafi> it just gave me trouble customizing it
[11:53:14] <grafi> i played around a bit and it was a very weird experience ^^
[11:53:22] <grafi> although I like how it looks
[11:53:32] <grafi> the css is strange sometimes
[11:53:44] <raj> Cork, can you tell me what you meant by `this` carrying all the necessary data?
[11:53:48] <raj> in an eventhandler
[11:54:14] <Cork> raj: this refers to the element the event was fired on
[11:54:40] <Cork> so all the dynamic data should be accessable from that element
[11:54:52] <raj> you mean .data() on the element?
[11:55:03] <Cork> that is one option yes
[11:55:08] <raj> what's another?
[11:55:22] <Cork> children, structure, classes
[11:55:25] <Cork> and so on
[11:56:09] <BillCriswell> I wish Sass %placeholder selectors worked in different media queries.
[11:56:36] <raj> gotcha
[11:56:38] <Cork> placeholder?
[11:56:44] <raj> thank you
[11:57:07] <Cork> BillCriswell: you mean like for values to properties?
[11:59:02] <BillCriswell> Cork: like.. %half { width: 50%; } @media ( min-width: 100px ) { .bio { @extend %half; } }
[11:59:25] * Cork nods
[11:59:45] <Cork> i usually use @include instead
[11:59:48] <BillCriswell> Cork: As far as I know you have to set %half in each media query.
[12:00:10] <BillCriswell> Cork: Yeah, then the code gets repetitive in my experience.
[12:00:29] <Cork> ya, but it also becomes easier to read though
[12:01:18] <BillCriswell> Cork: The output definitely, but the "source" can be just as easy to read.
[12:01:33] <Cork> BillCriswell: no i meant the source
[12:01:45] <BillCriswell> Sass & jQuery are still my favorite things of all time.
[12:02:21] <Cork> well jquery is losing some of it's glamor for me, but scss is nice :)
[12:02:25] <BillCriswell> Cork: .foo { @include bar(); } vs .foo { @extend %bar } ?
[12:03:22] <Cork> BillCriswell: i got a nasty after taste when i had to write a patch/plugin to kill of .end in jquery
[12:03:42] <Cork> cause i found that it is a nasty memory leak unless you always keep it in mind
[12:04:13] <motaka2> Can anyone tell my why keuup does not work on my textarea in this code?   http://jsfiddle.net/X2FDe/
[12:04:42] <BillCriswell> Cork: Not sure I ever had to do anything that tricky.
[12:05:11] <Cork> BillCriswell: window.handle = $('.target').first(); how many dom element would you expect this line to keep a reference to
[12:05:23] <Cork> if you have 500 elements with the class target?
[12:05:33] <BillCriswell> I'd assume 1.
[12:05:36] <Cork> nope
[12:05:37] <Cork> 500
[12:06:01] <Cork> window.handle.prevObject will be the full $('.target') set
[12:06:17] <Cork> its totally mad...
[12:06:25] <BillCriswell> Cork: Ah I see.
[12:06:33] <Cork> and all just so ppl can call $().soemthing().end().original
[12:06:49] <Cork> and annoyingly enough jquery ui depends on it :/
[12:07:01] <Cork> so i had to patch the parts i neede from there too
[12:07:13] <Cork> was less impressed after that :)
[12:07:46] <BillCriswell> Ah, so would handle.end().addClass('foo') add foo to all .targets?
[12:07:52] <Cork> BillCriswell: google for memory jquery and prevObject
[12:07:55] <Cork> it is a common problem
[12:08:00] <Cork> BillCriswell: yes
[12:08:22] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[12:08:47] <Cork> or just handle.prevObject.addClass('foo')
[12:08:52] <Cork> as it is basically the same thing
[12:09:02] <doug65536> they're just references though right?
[12:09:21] <Cork> doug65536: sure, but that means those elements won't go away
[12:10:06] <doug65536> so if you did $('.target').slice(1).remove() the selector would keep them alive even though you might think they'll go away
[12:10:15] <motaka2> Cork: What about me?
[12:10:16] <Cork> var container = $('#container'); window.anser.push(container.find('.target').first()); container.empty();
[12:10:34] <Cork> *woops* you just leaked 499 elements
[12:11:35] <Cork> well that is 499 unless those elements happens to have children
[12:11:39] <doug65536> a "fix" would be to do this, right? $($('.target').first())
[12:11:41] <Cork> then you would leak them too
[12:11:46] <Cork> doug65536: nope
[12:12:03] <motaka2> Can anyone tell my why keuup does not work on my textarea in this code? http://jsfiddle.net/X2FDe/
[12:12:04] <BillCriswell> I would not expend .end() to do that for some reason.
[12:12:16] <BillCriswell> expect*
[12:12:33] <Cork> doug65536 var target = container.find('.target').first(); target.prevObject = null; window.anser.push(target);
[12:12:34] <doug65536> a "fix" would be to do this, right? $($('.target')[0])
[12:12:58] <Cork> or just storing the dom element without jquery
[12:14:08] <adrian_lc> hi, trying to use a jQuery ui icon with a <button>
[12:14:32] <adrian_lc> I got it but the alignment is wrong, it's bottom right
[12:14:39] <adrian_lc> not in the middle
[12:15:42] <motaka2> Cork: Can anyone tell my why keuup does not work on my textarea in this code? http://jsfiddle.net/X2FDe/
[12:15:43] <doug65536> Cork: a "real" fix would be to do $('.target:first') wouldn't it?
[12:15:48] <adrian_lc> what can I do since I can't change background-position without changing the icon?

[12:16:57] <Cork> doug65536: i don't like them cause it implies code in text strings
[12:17:26] <trivender> how can I do this.
[12:17:43] <Cork> doug65536: also it isn't the best of ides as they are quite a bit slower then running them like normal functions
[12:19:01] <Cork> doug65536: and the problem is still around cause as soon as you ever reference a result from jquery you would have to check so it doens't have a prev reference
[12:21:38] <doug65536> Cork: it is an irrelevant problem unless you have selectors that select a large number of elements, which you subsequently remove, and the lifetime of the selector is long. ihmo, worrying about it will be more of a cause of superstition than memory leaks
[12:23:18] <Cork> doug65536: no it isn't irrelevant
[12:24:14] <Cork> doug65536: it is something that quite easy can be a problem if you ever do things with results from jquery selectors or filters
[12:24:52] <Cork> doug65536: scopes and function calls where you send a value form a jquery object would easy be a reference that would keep all the elements alive

[13:01:27] <Newbie_3D> hello again I have a  script that i want to inject it each time i open a web page !
[13:01:30] <Newbie_3D> what's the process to create  a chrome extension to use it?
[13:01:47] <tgodar> just curious... there any way with JS to get hooks into a page refresh?  F5 make xhr refresh call rather than hard refresh?
[13:02:51] <tgodar> assuming not
[13:03:41] <odium> Is there a clever way to use lighttpd, nginx or apache to provide a directory listing dynamically for javascript to format? I don't want to reinvent the wheel, but I once wrote a server to do this and may do it again.
[13:03:46] <tgodar> might be able to come up with something using window onbeforeunload to sorta do what I am thinking...
[13:04:18] <Cork> motaka2: i would write it like this http://jsfiddle.net/4aFHY/6/
[13:05:00] <darts_> need a bit help in this http://jsfiddle.net/3JynZ/1/
[13:05:00] <Cork> motaka2: as it would make this work http://jsfiddle.net/4aFHY/7/
[13:05:17] <darts_> its simulation of lampord clocks :|
[13:05:44] <darts_>  the problem is i copied array into another array using slice(0)
[13:05:58] <darts_>  when i edit the cloned array it also updates the original array
[13:06:24] <Cork> darts_: objects are references in javascript
[13:06:34] <Cork> you need to duplicate them if you want pure copies
[13:07:23] <darts_> okie
[13:07:28] <Cork> darts_: $.makeArray is one way to do that
[13:08:18] <darts_> var dstArr = srcArr.slice(0);
[13:08:26] <darts_> this will not work u mean ?
[13:10:31] <Cork> js> var a = [{a:1}, {b:2}]; var b = a.slice(0); print(a[0] === b[0]);
[13:10:38] <b-ot> Cork: true
[13:10:51] <Cork> darts_: as you are copying the value from the array
[13:11:00] <Cork> your copying the reference to the object
[13:11:02] <Cork> not the object
[13:14:49] <darts_> Cork: still not clear :(
[13:15:04] <Cork> darts_: http://jsfiddle.net/JFgM4/
[13:15:14] <Cork> a is an array
[13:15:22] <Cork> arrays is enhanced objects
[13:15:45] <Cork> variables point to objects, they don't contain them
[13:15:58] <Cork> so if you copy a variable you copy the pointer to the same object
[13:16:29] <Cork> if you want to copy an object you need to make a new object and copy over all the keys and values to the new object
[13:16:41] <Cork> $.extend does this
[13:17:41] <darts_> trying
[13:26:11] <darts_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/JFgM4/1/ have a look at this ...
[13:26:55] <Cork> ok?
[13:28:08] <darts_> ??
[13:28:21] <darts_> i m using this method to copy in my code
[13:28:31] <Cork> darts_: http://jsfiddle.net/JFgM4/2/
[13:28:37] <Cork> you just copied the outer array
[13:29:11] <Cork> darts_: every time you have an array or object you need to duplicate them
[13:29:19] <Cork> or you will have a reference from there on in
[13:29:38] <darts_> okie
[13:34:03] <darts_> Cork: thank you, got it working :)

[13:59:15] <raj> tampermonkey?
[13:59:49] <shoky> cuore: you automatically load extensions just like you would a non-jquery extension
[13:59:58] <shoky> with a background page, iirc
[14:00:25] <raj> fine, let shoky be the hero
[14:00:45] <shoky> i see there are also event pages now
[14:01:45] <cuore> raj: what's a tampermonkey?  :p
[14:02:03] <raj> like greasemonkey for chrome
[14:02:21] <raj> maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean by "extension"

[15:56:25] <hfp> Hi guys! I am writing HTML, CSS and jQuery code in files on my computer. I have no web server or anything installed, just calling the page with its full file:// path. It works fine for HTML and CSS but it seems the jQuery part is not having any effect. I tested the code in an online WYSIWYG editor so I know the code is ok. What am I missing? Does jQuery requires some kind of server framework? If so, is there anything comparable to LAMP

[15:57:13] <hfp> The error I am getting from the Chrome inspector is "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined"

[15:59:19] <jammsen> in the input sorry
[15:59:20] <HD|Laptop> hfp: you dont have a <script src="jquery-...js"></script> in your html

[16:03:13] <hfp> I see. This was a dumb question, I guess I got confused between JavaScript that is built in the browser and jQuery that isn't. Why is it that on codecademy editor you don't need to reference to a jQuery other than your own script?

[17:09:33] <synth_> anyone have experience in Highcharts?
[17:32:07] <pop_pop> I need to do a redesign of a menu interface modelled after jquery tabs.
[17:32:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> pop_pop: explain
[17:32:35] <pop_pop> on my phone so might take a sec lol
[17:33:04] <pop_pop> I know the tabs in jq ui are spans and they just wrap
[17:34:02] <pop_pop> but i changed them to be nowrap
[17:34:18] <pop_pop> because i didnt like the wrapped look
[17:35:25] <pop_pop> the people here like the knterface in the tab metaphor, not a menu metaphor
[17:36:13] <pop_pop> but the tabs can take up a lot of width so they eventually squish up when the width is getting too narrow
[17:36:44] <pop_pop> so i need some ideas for a compromise
[17:37:02] <pop_pop> and something responsive
[17:37:36] <pop_pop> the number of tabs is totally variable, as is the text
[17:38:10] <pop_pop> so i can't stick in arbitrary breakpoints for responsiveness
[17:40:14] <pop_pop> id be okay with js-based respinsiveness
[17:42:52] <pop_pop> I could change to a vertical tabs
[17:43:09] <pop_pop> but that'd take up more vertical space than I'd like
[17:43:14] <pop_pop> horiz*
[17:43:55] <pop_pop> as a fix, I could make the left side tabs there slide away
[17:44:24] <pop_pop> showing only a minimal version of the tab, say icon, or short text
[17:45:13] <pop_pop> it's a bit of a change though from current. my bosses may not take to it quickly
[17:45:53] <pop_pop> um, so. it's my turn for haircut

[22:03:11] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: Hi, I'm trying to display a second modal after the first one is closed.
[22:03:28] <HowardwLo> all the alerts are there to help me debug, but i can't find the issue
[22:04:17] <sahbeewah> cronin, http://jsfiddle.net/GTanJ/2/
[22:05:00] <sahbeewah> HowardwLo, also, the modal doesn't close?
[22:05:10] <cronin> sahbeewah: thanks!
[22:05:14] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: Ya i can't get it to close, i think its because its throwing an error
[22:05:38] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: i've noticed if the code is wrong, it'll not close or not reveal at all. can't figure out why
[22:07:03] <sahbeewah> HowardwLo, well the most glaring problem is your trigger line
[22:08:24] <sahbeewah> not familiar with foundation but it doesn't seem to be closing without errors
[22:09:26] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: http://jsfiddle.net/CA669/1015/ this is throwing out 1 and e1
[22:09:36] <HowardwLo> i don't understand how it can succeed and then error?
[22:13:56] <sahbeewah> it's not succeeding and failing
[22:15:11] <sahbeewah> you're evaluating the alert function, and getting its return value (null), and assigning that as the success / error callbacks
[22:15:27] <sahbeewah> of an ajax call that you're not making
[22:18:24] <sahbeewah> HowardwLo,  http://jsfiddle.net/CA669/1016/
[22:19:27] <sahbeewah> tip: don't try to guess functionality, the docs are there for a reason
[22:21:58] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: i couldn't understand the docs =/
[22:22:23] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: could you explain a little bit about what you did and how you got there?
[22:23:56] <jl2753> hey guys, hoping someone can help me out real quick. I'm trying to dynamically resize an embedded youtube video based on screen size, but for some reason the height isn't changing: http://jsfiddle.net/CA669/1012/
[22:24:35] <sahbeewah> HowardwLo, which part don't you understand?
[22:26:10] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: I guess the "opened" part msotly
[22:26:23] <HowardwLo> I looked at the bottom of the docs, it tells me opened, open closed and close
[22:26:36] <HowardwLo> but i could never get close or closed to work
[22:31:24] <sahbeewah> jl2753, http://jsfiddle.net/CA669/1017/
[22:37:21] <jl2753> sahbeewah: thank you! I'm still not sure what I did wrong though, was it something with the syntax?
[22:45:07] <sahbeewah> sorry had to do something
[22:45:07] <sahbeewah> um
[22:46:32] <sahbeewah> $('#firstModal').on('reveal', 'close', function(){
[22:46:45] <sahbeewah> is kind of non-sensical in this context
[22:47:33] <sahbeewah> in jquery the syntax for assigning event handlers is -> element.on(event, event_handler_function)
[22:47:58] <sahbeewah> the foundation docs mention you can bind to the open, opened, close and closed events
[22:49:15] <sahbeewah> having said that, the docs also implies that you can latch onto these events by specifying them upon initialization, which doesn't seem to work
[22:49:27] <sahbeewah> soo, yeah
[22:53:53] <sahbeewah> oh wait, yes it does... they just don't clarify how to initialize... here's an alternative: http://jsfiddle.net/CA669/1018/ (not recommended)
[22:54:30] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: open, opened, close, and closed are events of the element? in other words, what status the element is in?
[22:55:50] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: well that revision is actually closing now. The reason why i had the (.close-reveal-modal).click is because i want the user to manually close a modal, whereby i'll introduce another.
[22:56:07] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: So I think i want to use the "close" event rather than "opened"
[22:56:38] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: ah, that gives me an infinite loop
[22:56:56] <sahbeewah> it's a foundation feature. foundation will trigger an event on the element once it knows the animation for (for example) closing a modal completes.
[22:57:10] <sahbeewah> so you can "catch" the event when that occurs, and do something
[22:57:33] <sahbeewah> open/opened/close/closed aren't standard events in javascript/jquery
[22:57:47] <HowardwLo> shabeewah: right, they foundation only
[22:59:35] * sahbeewah nods
[22:59:53] <sahbeewah> well, twitter bootstrap also uses those names for their modals, and probably others...
[23:01:54] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: ok that last revision gave me a great example. Thanks for your help
[23:02:05] <HowardwLo> I just need to figure out how to make it not auto open on every close lol
[23:38:44] <lonejack> Is there a way to understand if a div hasn't set height(that is is "auto")?
