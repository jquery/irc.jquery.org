[00:04:27] <iszak> Anyone seen the new Notepad++ design?
[00:04:54] <^zoggy^> new?
[00:05:01] <^zoggy^> been the same way for awhile now
[00:05:06] <iszak> yeah http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
[00:05:38] <^zoggy^> yeah, use it daily
[00:05:50] <iszak> so you've seen the new design then?
[00:07:13] <^zoggy^> well i dont really know of an old design
[00:07:20] <^zoggy^> been the same way since ive started using it
[00:07:58] <iszak> ^zoggy^, if you actually clicked the link you will see it's not the same design anymore.
[00:08:19] <xec> iszak: you mean the webpage, not the program?
[00:08:23] <iszak> yes
[00:08:31] <^zoggy^> yeah i dont use their website. i use their app
[00:08:31] <iszak> haha should have said
[00:08:35] <^zoggy^> jesus
[00:09:21] <iszak> oh haha

[00:33:03] <nir0> hi, i need to access p element of self
[00:33:31] <nir0> self.elements('p') didn't work
[00:34:48] <coldhead> you need to read the documentation to see what methods to use
[00:34:53] <coldhead> you can't just guess
[00:34:57] <coldhead> ?find @ nir0
[00:34:57] <bot-t> nir0, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[00:35:08] <coldhead> ?filter @ nir0
[00:35:08] <bot-t> nir0, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[00:35:24] <coldhead> or possibly .get(0)
[00:35:46] <nir0> k, i need find('p')[0] i think
[00:35:58] <reypa> hi guys
[00:36:02] <coldhead> or find('p').get(0)
[00:36:08] <coldhead> good work, nir0

[00:38:10] <reypa> can somebody help me with jquery mobile? i get an "Error Loading Page", it still works, but its shown for a short time, why? you can see it at mobitest.coop.ch if you search for a place
[00:39:32] <nir0> funny, but find('p') works like search on page
[00:43:01] <coldhead> lol
[00:45:32] <Sample> Does no one know? My question is simply: what's the difference between something like: var tag = 'input'; $('.class '+ tag) and $('.class').find(tag)
[00:46:47] <Hooloovoo> Sample: Not much
[00:47:03] <Haprog> Sample: the result should be the same
[00:47:22] <coldhead> the find() method will probably take longer
[00:47:23] <Hooloovoo> Sample: .find() is practical if you do $(this).find("whatever")
[00:47:31] <Haprog> maybe some minor difference in performance?
[00:47:31] <coldhead> because it hits the selector engine twice
[00:48:01] <Hooloovoo> Apart from that there's not really a good reason to use it.
[00:49:22] <reypa> anybody that could take a quik look at my problem?
[00:49:33] <Hooloovoo> reypa: Just tell us =P
[00:49:52] <reypa> hooloovoo, did it a few lines ago =)
[00:49:54] <reypa> can somebody help me with jquery mobile? i get an "Error Loading Page", it still works, but its shown for a short time, why? you can see it at mobitest.coop.ch if you search for a place
[00:50:25] <Paveloosha> Hi.. when you are writing $('.class'+tag), it is same as $('.classinput') not $('.class input')..
[00:51:03] <Hooloovoo> reypa: Sry, missed that. I haven't tried jquery mobile yet so i don't know =/
[00:51:16] <reypa> Hooloovoo, ah okey no problem
[00:51:25] <reypa> but the jquery mobile channel is empty
[00:51:27] <reypa> =(
[01:03:44] <arch_adam> doea nay one know why animating an absolute positioned element in ie7 does not work?
[01:04:46] <Paveloosha> Hi "arch_adam" please paste your code..
[01:05:37] <arch_adam> Paveloosha, http://pastebin.com/2HmGRNmT
[01:05:59] <Paveloosha> okay
[01:06:30] <arch_adam> Paveloosha, sorry, http://pastebin.com/u8GUadx4
[01:06:53] <arch_adam> Paveloosha, it works perfect in ie 8 and firefox.
[01:09:10] <Paveloosha> is any animation working in ie7 ?
[01:09:20] <Paveloosha> from your code?
[01:11:53] <anli__> Is onchange trigged for a <select> when an element is selected in ANY browser?
[01:11:58] <anli__> Seems that IE gives me problem
[01:12:45] <nVee> Sup everyone! I am busy going through a lynda.com tutorial on jQuery and I noticed they use bind and unbind for events. I have tested it and it appears to still work in the latest version of jquery (the one they used is 1.3.something) - Is the bind and unbind functions still being used or is it better to just use mouseover() ect directly?
[01:12:49] <arch_adam> i have figured it out now :-)
[01:13:32] <Paveloosha> ohh.. great.. so what was the problem?
[01:14:05] <JeanM> How come this returns 2 elements, but when I try to do .live "click" on it, the action never fires? (without not it works) console.log $("[data-type=list] [data-action=edit]").not("[data-disabled=true]")

[01:16:51] <ajpiano> nVee: bind and unbind are still in common use
[01:17:02] <ajpiano> what has really changed since 1.3 is the existence of delegate

[01:19:25] <reypa> Does somebody has expirience with jquery Mobile?
[01:19:55] <Phil-Work> reypa, ask your question - someone might know
[01:20:51] <reypa> You can see my Problem on mobitest.coop.ch, wehn searching for a Place there is a short "Error Loading Page" befor the Page loads, even if i disable Ajay this happens. Page does load normal but the Error is annoying
[01:21:13] <reypa> *oh god sorry for the typos
[01:24:15] <AdvoWork> if im doing: element.find('.event_icon') to find my span, whats the best way of adding an image to that span?
[01:25:52] <Freddi> $('span.event_icon').addClass(background);  "background" can be any class in which you specify a bg image
[01:28:07] <Sample> Hooloovoo: Re: find being practical for $(this).find('whatever');, you could just as easily do $(this +' whatever') and my question holds.
[01:28:46] <Sample> I'm a bit surprised no one has looked into the implications of this. I would certainly prefer the more performance saavy alternative than randomly typing about "willy-nilly"
[01:32:42] <krz> ive got the following string: '12 foobars'. how do i get '12'?
[01:34:25] <Hooloovoo> krz: string.split(" ")[0]
[01:34:44] <krz> grazie!
[01:34:48] <Hooloovoo> np
[01:36:03] <Hooloovoo> Sample: I'm pretty sure you can't combine $(this) with another selector directly.
[01:36:09] <Hooloovoo> At least i can't get it to work.
[01:36:19] <reypa> how do i disable all the Ajax on my site?
[01:36:36] <gym_jane> hi all
[01:37:01] <Hooloovoo> reypa: try $.ajax = false or something like that. might work, but it sure ain't pretty.
[01:37:12] <gym_jane> i got a table which lists some brand names, i want to be able to hover on the brand name and for it to display their site in a pop up
[01:37:15] <gym_jane> is it possible?
[01:37:48] <Freddi> yes
[01:37:48] <_bart_> Hi
[01:38:10] <premapix> gym_jane: Is the site URL in the table?
[01:38:12] <gym_jane> how? any pointers or examples?
[01:38:42] <gym_jane> premapix it is like this http://statistics.allfacebook.com/pages/leaderboard/-/-/-/f/DESC/-/
[01:38:56] <Hooloovoo> gym_jane: i think you'd have to use iframes tho.
[01:39:03] <premapix> gym_jane: Hang on
[01:39:11] <gym_jane> thank premapix
[01:39:24] <gym_jane> Hooloovoo i think so although that is not good :/
[01:39:32] <krz> Hooloovoo sorry, what if the string looks like: '(12 foobars)'. how do i get '12'?
[01:39:43] <atrioom> Does anybody know how to prevent fadeIn from taking over the viewport (scrolltop position)? almost seems like a bug... (chrome latest release, jquery 1.6.1)
[01:40:19] <premapix> gym_jane: Do you know where the site info is coming from?
[01:40:40] <gym_jane> what do you mean the site info? as in the url?
[01:40:45] <premapix> Yes
[01:40:46] <Hooloovoo> krz: ok then i'd prolly do string.split(" ")[0]; newstring.split("(")[1];
[01:41:10] <krz> thats fugly
[01:41:15] <gym_jane> premapix for example the third row eminim would be http://www.facebook.com/eminem
[01:41:20] <krz> split twice?
[01:41:53] <gym_jane> premapix basically i want the users to be able to preview the page when they click on a row
[01:42:02] <Hooloovoo> krz: yup. that's the easiest way i can think of.
[01:42:28] <premapix> OK -- detect click on the link and use JQUI panel to display the page
[01:42:36] <premapix> Sorry hover
[01:42:41] <gym_jane> only ig i knew how to lol
[01:42:44] <gym_jane> any examples?
[01:43:21] <premapix> Is there an email I can post to? Got to go just now
[01:44:08] <gym_jane> pvt msged you my email
[01:44:25] <premapix> Cool will get back to you. Bi for now
[01:44:35] <gym_jane> k thanks
[01:45:27] <djQuery> gym_jane: or take a snapshot of the site server side.
[01:45:51] <gym_jane> yeh that would make sense
[01:46:07] <gym_jane> but want this to be a quick job really
[01:47:06] <djQuery> the problem with doing it in an iframe is that some sites detect if they are in iframe then redirect
[01:47:17] <gym_jane> found this http://www.cssglobe.com/lab/tooltip/03/
[01:47:32] <amo__> Hello everybody
[01:47:55] <amo__> I have a question that is not totally specific to jquery
[01:48:13] <amo__> I wish to develop a new Ui for a quite complex website
[01:48:29] <amo__> this UI will do a heavy use of Ajax
[01:48:51] <gym_jane> how about this? http://www.sarpdoruktahmaz.com/projects/j-link-preview/
[01:48:54] <amo__> and i'm msearching for "best practice" or methods to manage the Js part properly
[01:49:21] <djQuery> amo__: tempates?
[01:49:28] <djQuery> ?template
[01:49:30] <bot-t> djQuery, Templates - These documentation topics concern the jQuery Templates plugin (jquery-tmpl), which can be downloaded from: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl . http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
[01:50:04] <amo__> i did not know template :) i read this ilnk and will be back if necessary . thank you
[01:51:35] <djQuery> but ur being kinda vague
[01:57:06] <PrinceES> i am having a little bug on my source code... http://pastebin.com/E2gxG2yC ... Actually, i am retreiving XML data and display them on the home banner slider ... i am using this jquery slider extension http://demo.awkwardgroup.com/showcase/index2.html
[01:57:12] <PrinceES> please help me out...
[01:57:44] <^zoggy^> that is some ugly code
[01:57:52] <PrinceES> i can see the fetched xml data
[01:58:10] <PrinceES> but having problem on display them into jquery slider
[01:58:28] <reypa> Is there a way to Disable error Handling from jquery mobile? or to disable the error dialogs?
[01:58:30] <PrinceES> <^zoggy^> yes.... i know it seems damn ugly
[01:58:51] <PrinceES> but... once i will have everything working
[01:59:32] <PrinceES> then i will change delete unuseful stuffs on it...
[01:59:50] <PrinceES> but it is very important to everything will work
[02:00:53] <amo__> djQuery jquery-tmpl is kinda templating system to populate pseudo html templates with Javascript data., this is not what i meant :) but looks promising.
[02:00:57] <amo__> in other words
[02:01:10] <^zoggy^> 	dataType: "xml",
[02:01:39] <amo__> imagine i'm considering coding Gmail or GoogleMaps or any other UI that makes a heavy use of Ajax
[02:01:45] <^zoggy^> PrinceES, instead of using the shorthand .get, try using .ajax and actually defining your data type and other options
[02:01:51] <PrinceES> there is same class object on the line 54 and 61 which is "showcase-all-content"  ... i added this class.. just because displaying xml data on the slider
[02:02:15] <amo__> Where can i Find methods or Best practice to avoid having a pure mess in my javascript code
[02:02:17] <PrinceES> <^zoggy^> ok.. i am going use ajax and datatype xml
[02:03:47] <Hooloovoo> amo__: Best thins is to practice =P
[02:03:57] <amo__> :'(
[02:05:24] <amo__> Hooloovoo best things to get better is either to ask for good tips from others ;-) i already practiced quite much but never for such a wide UI project
[02:09:05] <reypa> anybody knows how to diable error dialogs?
[02:09:45] <PrinceES> <^zoggy^> still having the same bug .... http://pastebin.com/DLTAa0p9
[02:09:56] <PrinceES> i have changed what you suggested to me
[02:10:09] <PrinceES> now i am using ajax function on it...
[02:12:56] <^zoggy^> PrinceES, can you put the code up on http://jsfiddle.net
[02:13:07] <PrinceES> sure.
[02:13:07] <^zoggy^> so others can view/work with the code live
[02:13:24] <zhrance> goodday! :)
[02:14:08] <^zoggy^> btw you left off the dataType option for the .ajax
[02:14:11] <zhrance> I am wondering if you use the jquery sortable and you use the sortable function for horizontal as vertical. How can I define the height? because the 'li' elements do float. And for some reason a footer with clear both within the UL doesn't work
[02:15:07] <^zoggy^> line-height
[02:15:15] <atrioom> Does anybody know how to prevent fadeIn from taking over the viewport (scrolltop position)? almost seems like a bug... (chrome latest release, jquery 1.6.1)
[02:15:45] <PrinceES> <^zoggy^> here you may have a look http://jsfiddle.net/gA3ef/
[02:15:53] <^zoggy^> ty
[02:16:43] <zhrance> ^zoggy^ line-height?
[02:18:24] <nir0> i got UL > LI LI LI, LI > A, and i need to know which A got WIDTH == X, and apply a method to A, places in next LI
[02:18:41] <nir0> placed
[02:19:23] <nir0> if there's no LI after current, first LI should be taken instead
[02:19:52] <nir0> its for auto-rotation
[02:29:49] <Lomex> Simple task. I have alot of elements, if I click one of them I want it to change background-color, if i click another I want to set back the recently clicked background and set it for the new element I clicked. Can anyone tell me how to do this?
[02:30:18] <Lomex> I dont need detailed help, just how you would do this in general? Save old element in variable?
[02:30:21] <Lomex> And reset it on click?
[02:33:57] <reypa> how do i disable error dialogs?
[02:38:06] <atrioom> Lomex, you could basically think up a way.
[02:38:14] <aaairc> i have a click event that calls a function that changes the html of a div, measures its size, and then positions it based on that measured size... what seems to be happening though is that when it measures the size with .width(), .height()... it measures it based on the size of the div prior to having its html changed... even though i call $("#mydiv").width(), $("#mydiv").height() calls after doing a bunch of $("#mydiv").html(...)
[02:38:14] <aaairc> within the function.
[02:38:26] <Lomex> atrioom: I could store the current element in a variable, and reset it on next click
[02:38:27] <atrioom> store variables in hidden elements, store them in the data object...
[02:38:48] <Bert_2> Hi, I'm somewhat confused, does jquery (ui) have a built-in color selector or not ?
[02:38:57] <atrioom> for example. or create a hidden element after the element you click dynamically with the background color you want to save
[02:39:04] <atrioom> its basically up to you and what you like most
[02:39:28] <atrioom> and presumably what works best in all browsers :P
[02:39:40] <aaairc> is there a method i could call before doing the .width() and .height() measurements... that will ensure the height and width of the div returned will reflect all the html changes that i'm doing. so like repainting it or something while staying invisible?
[02:40:30] <Lomex> atrioom: How can i save the current element to a variable? :D im new to java :P
[02:40:33] <Lomex> and jquery
[02:40:43] <atrioom> Lomex it is javascript.
[02:40:57] <Lomex> javascript yes
[02:41:53] <atrioom> you probably want to start with basic faq and docs first. to answer your question, have a look at this: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[02:41:58] <Hooloovoo> Lomex: you can do var element = $("jquery selector")
[02:42:07] <Lomex> ah okay
[02:42:09] <atrioom> yes, you can do that.
[02:42:14] <Lomex> and then element will be a jquery object?
[02:42:14] <djQuery> ?101@Lomex
[02:42:15] <bot-t> Lomex, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[02:42:44] <Lomex> so i could do element.hide() for example?
[02:42:55] <atrioom> correct
[02:42:56] <Lomex> Or call other jquery functions on element?
[02:42:57] <Lomex> thanks
[02:43:06] <CerealWasTaken> Protip: it's not java. People will hate you if you say it's java. First time's exempt.
[02:44:40] <atrioom> aaairc what do you want to do?
[02:47:04] <aaairc> atrioom: i have a popup that i'm centering on the page... each time that popup is called i set the html on it, based on the button on the page that clicked it. when i try and measure the popups height and width, it is measuring the height and width from the previous state... not the height and width of the popup that is about to appear based on the new html that i've set
[02:47:15] <aaairc> atrioom: does that make sense, or is it too convoluted of an explanation?
[02:47:31] <EugenA> anybody knows how to remove default text from password field? user selects username (using browser autocomplete function), after that password appears and default text doesn't disappear
[02:48:06] <djQuery> aaairc: seems a lot easier to just use see ?ui.dialog
[02:48:07] <bot-t> aaairc, A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[02:48:08] <atrioom> aaairc hmm, try measuring the height and with in a callback function. that ensures that the modification you were doing are done
[02:48:29] <atrioom> *width
[02:49:02] <aaairc> atrioom: can i have the dialog window without the title bar... so just have it display my div
[02:49:22] <atrioom> by dialog window you mean popup?
[02:49:52] <aaairc> atrioom: i mean the jqueryui dialog... is it harded coded that it has a title bar in it
[02:50:13] <djQuery> var $mydiv =$('$myDiv').load('url', {someparam: 'whatever'}, function(){ $mydiv.dialog({modal: true}); })
[02:50:37] <aaairc> atrioom: what would a callback function be that would ensure the modifications are done?
[02:50:53] <FinalAngel> I have an element <input> now I would like to traverse to the surrounding <form> element, what would be the best way to do this. input.parent().parent()… is not so flexible
[02:51:10] <CerealWasTaken> aaairc: any callback is "called back" after whatever is done.
[02:51:16] <izepstan> hello everyone, in the j-ui channel noone is answering, short question about custom styling, i made some tabs, downloaded a custom layout but it applies the default one, what did i wrong, does i have to change the class "class="ui-tabs ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all"" to some custom classes?
[02:51:25] <atrioom> aaairc http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_callback.asp   take a look at this
[02:51:34] <CerealWasTaken> so attach a callback function to the part where you fill your div with html. in this callback, do the measurements et.c.
[02:52:27] <CerealWasTaken> FinalAngel: input.parent('form') no?
[02:52:34] <djQuery>  css code .notitle.ui-dialog-titlebar {display: none; }       var $mydiv =$('$myDiv').load('url', {someparam: 'whatever'}, function(){ $mydiv.dialog({modal: true, addClass: 'notitle'}); })
[02:52:34] <aaairc> ok i think that makes sense. am gonna give it a shot
[02:53:27] <djQuery> FinalAngel: see ?closest
[02:53:28] <bot-t> FinalAngel, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[02:53:33] <FinalAngel> CerealWasTaken sadly does not work that way
[02:53:45] <FinalAngel> thanks
[02:53:59] <CerealWasTaken> Right, too easy.
[02:54:13] <FinalAngel> yeah thats works, though its pretty slow
[02:54:20] <FinalAngel> (speaking of ms)
[02:54:38] <djQuery> well theres parentUntil as well
[02:55:05] <CerealWasTaken> see ?parentUntil
[02:55:06] <bot-t> CerealWasTaken, .parent() - Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[02:55:28] <atrioom> try using an id-selector and not "input". id selectors are much faster. (in case you dont need the superflexibility)
[02:55:46] <FinalAngel> yeah already in use anways
[02:55:57] <PrinceES> i am having a little bug on my source code... http://pastebin.com/E2gxG2yC ... Actually, i am retreiving XML data and display them on the home banner slider ... i am using this jquery slider extension http://demo.awkwardgroup.com/showcase/index2.html
[02:56:32] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: can a .click() have a call back function? could i do $(button).click(function(){... adjust html... }, function(){ ... measure div, make it visible... });
[02:57:04] <PrinceES> on my code...
[02:57:27] <izepstan> someone, please?
[02:57:32] <PrinceES> everything works ... just wouldnt display to the fetched xml data on the banner slider
[02:57:39] <CerealWasTaken> aaairc: I don't think that'd work
[02:58:11] <CerealWasTaken> You'll want the callback on the statement where you load content into your div
[02:58:16] <CerealWasTaken> Can I see your code?
[02:58:34] <aaairc> let me drop it into a jfiddle or something
[02:58:37] <aaairc> one sec
[02:58:40] <CerealWasTaken> Great
[02:58:50] <atrioom> click doesnt need a callback..
[02:59:04] <PrinceES> <CerealWasTaken> can you please help me
[02:59:06] <atrioom> it has no "duration"
[02:59:13] <PrinceES> i have very little problem
[02:59:22] <PrinceES> maybe you can help me for fixxing it up
[02:59:49] <atrioom> aaairc what adjustments do you do?
[03:00:07] <atrioom> aaairc i mean the exact jquery animations or modifications.
[03:00:29] <aaairc> atrioom: i'm gonna dop it into jsfiddle... one sec
[03:00:32] <CerealWasTaken> PrinceES: let me look at your links, sec
[03:00:38] <PrinceES> http://jsfiddle.net/gA3ef/9/
[03:00:42] <PrinceES> see this please
[03:00:56] <PrinceES> everything is more clear descibe on there
[03:01:49] <CerealWasTaken> Ok sec
[03:02:32] <PrinceES> i am using this jquery plugin.... http://demo.awkwardgroup.com/showcase/index2.html
[03:02:51] <PrinceES> so.. there is no way to fetch the data from xml...
[03:03:13] <PrinceES> therefore,. i have overwritten some extra code on it...
[03:03:15] <izepstan> hello everyone, in the j-ui channel noone is answering, short question about custom styling, i made some tabs, downloaded a custom layout but it applies the default one, what did i wrong, does i have to change the class "class="ui-tabs ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all"" to some custom classes?
[03:03:53] <PrinceES> and only problem is that on line  <div id="slider"></div>
[03:04:08] <CerealWasTaken> So I'm guessing the parseXml is something you put in there?
[03:04:53] <PrinceES> if i dont use this id "slider" and put manually between <div id="showcase" class="showcase"> </div> .. everything works
[03:05:04] <PrinceES> yes....
[03:05:42] <PrinceES> this is just prefixing to all div inside and append them in an id "slider"
[03:06:29] <PrinceES> and trying to display them through  <div id="slider"></div> inside html
[03:07:04] <CerealWasTaken> So it works if you just append them inside the div#showcase?
[03:07:44] <KingDosser> I have a click handler for an a tag that calls a function which then loads some html using AJAX and puts it into a div. At the moment, any <a> that are in that returned AJAX html will not be recongised by that handler. How can I get around this?
[03:11:23] <KingDosser> Anyone?
[03:14:58] <coldhead> ?live @ KingDosser
[03:14:58] <bot-t> KingDosser, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[03:15:03] <PrinceES> <CerealWasTaken>.. i am trying to setup something for you to see
[03:15:08] <PrinceES> please
[03:15:10] <coldhead> "or in the future" is your salvation
[03:15:28] <KingDosser> Oh nice to see you again coldhead. :)
[03:15:35] <coldhead> :D
[03:15:47] <coldhead> ?ud dosser
[03:15:50] <bot-t> coldhead, dosser - useless, waster, lazy person
[03:16:01] <coldhead> how rude
[03:16:11] <CerealWasTaken> Yeye no worries. I'm going through code now and tidying things up a little
[03:16:37] <KingDosser> ugh im insulted :P
[03:16:55] <KingDosser> coldhead: http://pastie.org/private/5urlx4ybufce4qe8yduzvg Any idea how I would implement .live() here?
[03:17:21] <coldhead> KingDosser: you should be able to repace .click(function with .live('click', function
[03:17:28] <coldhead> otherwise everything is the same
[03:17:31] <coldhead> replace*
[03:18:42] <coldhead> $("a[unit]").live('click', function (e) {
[03:19:43] <PrinceES> http://jsfiddle.net/JLdtB/
[03:19:43] <KingDosser> 	Yay thanks once again/ :)
[03:19:46] <PrinceES> here you can see
[03:20:01] <coldhead> always a pleasure, KingDosser
[03:20:08] <coldhead> your code is looking fine
[03:20:24] <PrinceES> it works here... if you dont use <div id="slider"></div>
[03:20:34] <KingDosser> coldhead: Really? Thats good to hear
[03:20:35] <PrinceES> and putting code manually
[03:20:58] <DarsVaeda> hey, how do I select an element that is before another element?
[03:22:23] <JKarsrud> DarsVaeda: see ?prev
[03:22:23] <bot-t> DarsVaeda, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[03:22:25] <Anticom> hi all
[03:22:33] <PrinceES> <CerealWasTaken> have you looked on it...
[03:22:37] <Anticom> how can i get colors in hex format using .css() ?
[03:22:53] <JKarsrud> DarsVaeda: or see ?parent
[03:22:54] <bot-t> DarsVaeda, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[03:22:59] <DarsVaeda> thx
[03:23:00] <PrinceES> on this js section... i have pasted to the core file of that plugin
[03:23:01] <CerealWasTaken> @Prince: Yup. Cleared up some things, now it's complaining that the plugin isn't there. Have you linked it?
[03:23:01] <JKarsrud> It all depends on what you mean by befoe :)
[03:23:04] <rocksprout> I'm using .each, like this:    $.each($("input[field='Result']"), function(i, e){  alert($(e).attr('field'));     });   .  I'm firebug stepping through it, and the selector is correctly returning a list of 6 elements, but when I hit step-over, it skips the function body; doesn't loop.  This seems really weird to me... I love .each, and it's never done this before...  what kind of ideas are there for debugging this?
[03:23:32] <JKarsrud> rocksprout: why not console.log e ?
[03:23:42] <rocksprout> JKarsrud, n00b :>
[03:24:09] <JKarsrud> step over will just skip it, won't it?
[03:24:15] <JKarsrud> when stepping through it
[03:24:24] <PrinceES> <CerealWasTaken>i have already added on the js section
[03:25:46] <gym_jane> any good jquery plugin for tables?
[03:25:56] <gym_jane> need on hover rows to expand in height nicely
[03:26:39] <rocksprout> JKarsrud,  well in any event, it doesn't trigger the function?  :/  It sounds rediculous, "it doesn't work", but that's all I can come up with :)
[03:27:31] <coldhead> gym_jane: for that it's probably simplest to DIY. the trick is to animate the CONTENTS of the table, rather than the TRs and TDs directly, because tables hate being animated
[03:28:16] <gym_jane> let me see if i can do it
[03:28:18] <gym_jane> thanks
[03:28:42] <JKarsrud> rocksprout: does it run when you don't debug?
[03:29:04] <JKarsrud> I rarely use much else than console.log/dir when debugging, soeh
[03:30:58] <rocksprout> JKarsrud, yes.  Console.log *does* make things easier.  in that little way you changed my life today.  Wee!  So now I know it's my problem.
[03:31:08] <JKarsrud> ;)
[03:31:35] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES> , problem is in data fetching..
[03:36:26] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES> , problem is in data fetching..check your $.ajax function
[03:37:44] <aaairc> atrioom: http://jsfiddle.net/3EDvG/
[03:37:53] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: http://jsfiddle.net/3EDvG/
[03:38:06] <aaairc> took me a while to try and show a cleaned up example...
[03:39:46] <aaairc> if you start clicking the divs to bring up the popups, you will see that the positioning of the popup is based on the size of the previous popup... not on the size of the popup thats about to come up
[03:44:10] <vileda> hi all, i have following ajax call https://gist.github.com/1071563
[03:45:01] <vileda> as you can see i want to do something on a 503 status, my webserver responses me 503 but my function isnt called
[03:46:12] <Paveloosha> @<aaairc>, I think "var boxHeight = box.height();" is not supplying exact data.. please check..
[03:46:17] <vileda> so, why the 503 statusCode callback doesn't work?
[03:47:46] <aaairc> Paveloosha: as it stands now, i think it is getting the box.height() of the box that was previously shown, not the one that is about to be shown. i'll test it though... one sec
[03:47:48] <CerealWasTaken> aaairc: I'll look at it.
[03:48:20] <CerealWasTaken> it sounds like things are being done in the wrong order.
[03:50:01] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: k thanks
[03:50:17] <Paveloosha> @<aaairc>, calculation is is happening b4 new image loading.. you may need to use .load() ..
[03:51:11] <CerealWasTaken> Ok so your code structure is not optimal. Imagine adding ten more boxes; your code would become an unmaintainable hell. You should probably factor out some of this stuff into reusable functions, more DRY.
[03:54:22] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: yeah i could believe that in terms of code structure... part of it was that i'm printing out all the jQuery with a templating engine that does a loop... and can only pass text to the client... so i'm going to have to store all the alternate info for the popup somewhere... i figured may as well just print out to the client all the jquery function variations
[03:54:51] <CerealWasTaken> Right. I don't judge, but it might help you.
[03:54:54] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: i'm just learning all this stuff though. got started with the Play! Framework a few days ago, and just learning jQuery
[03:55:08] <CerealWasTaken> Other than that I agree with Paveloosha. Use .load() or something; changing the src attribute might not make the appropriate calculations.
[03:55:53] <CerealWasTaken> You should really use callbacks more. Whenever you expect one process to have completed before the next begins, use a callback. Why risk just piling on more statements?
[03:56:17] <CerealWasTaken> I have to brb food but I'll look at your code more and see if I could rewrite a part of it.
[03:56:39] <Lomex> How can i return the current classes assigned to an element?
[03:57:22] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: that would be awesome. I'm trying to read about .load() right now to figure out how to use that
[03:58:02] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: yeah that makes sense. i literally just learned jQuery/javascript 2 days ago, so don't know the best practices yet.
[03:58:09] <Paveloosha> @<aaairc>, I have gone through this problem several times.. use .load()
[03:58:48] <aaairc> i'm in the process of reading about .load() but would it be like:  var box = $('#flyerdetail').load();
[03:59:47] <aaairc> Paveloosha: ^
[03:59:53] <Paveloosha> nope
[04:00:39] <Paveloosha> $('#flyerdetail').bind('load',function(){//do your stuff hre..})
[04:01:39] <aaairc> Paveloosha: cool gonna try and drop that in
[04:02:04] <Paveloosha> try it..
[04:02:18] <Paveloosha> :)
[04:05:14] <atrioom> i have an annoying problem with fadeIn(). it centers the viewport on the faded object everytime the interval() function triggers...
[04:05:21] <atrioom> any ideas how to prevent that?
[04:06:18] <atrioom> basically im not sure if its the interval() or the fadein() which causes the viewport to snap, but it does... so you cant scroll down the site without eventually being scrolled to top again
[04:06:20] <atrioom> which sucks :P
[04:07:32] <atrioom> i found a forum entry with a similar problem, but that guy clicked on links and the changed hash tags (#) acted like anchors, moving the viewport to the element... but i dont do such things. no clicking. no hashtags...
[04:08:59] <aaairc> Paveloosha: http://jsfiddle.net/QWmpV/ ... i tried doing the bind which you can see in the jsfiddle but it isn't changing the behavior
[04:09:37] <Paveloosha> @<aaairc>, let me check..
[04:09:39] <aaairc> Paveloosha: one sec... just saw something i screwed up
[04:10:48] <aaairc> Paveloosha: http://jsfiddle.net/DtrDe/1/
[04:11:14] <aaairc> ... not working right... its actually not doing whats in the load
[04:15:34] <Anticom> how can i get a hex value from .css('background-color');
[04:16:33] <Bert_2> I guess a jquery 1.
[04:16:40] <Bert_2> 4 plugin won't work anymore ?
[04:19:58] <aaairc> Anticom:   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740700/get-hex-value-rather-than-rgb-value-using-jquery
[04:21:26] <Armern> Hey guys. I'm trying to manually trigger the next/previous month buttons on the datepicker... but I cannot seem to find any way how. Does anyone here perhaps know?
[04:21:40] <Lomex> Are there any restrictions to removeClass() for some reason I cant remove a Class from an element :(
[04:22:37] <stenno> Lomex, do you do it like this: $(elem).removeClass(".test") or rather $(elem).removeClass("test");  (the latter one is correct)
[04:22:58] <sprezzatura> any good jquery based tables which supports sorting/grouping - i.e, it sorts not on the data displayed, but suitably sends the request to the  server, incases wherein only a subset of the data is displayed
[04:22:59] <bot-t> (29 hours 10 mins ago) <djQuery> tell sprezzatura something like this sprezzatura dont know why the text isnt changing though sprezzatura
[04:22:59] <bot-t> (29 hours 10 mins ago) <djQuery> tell sprezzatura something like this http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/XJvQ3/4/ dont know why the text isnt changing though
[04:23:58] <Lomex> stenno: I do it without the dot. it same command work in other context :(
[04:23:59] <Armern> Ah! Never mind! I figured it out :) $('#calendarmonth .ui-datepicker-next').click(); seems to do just the thing
[04:24:44] <stenno> good day, if i use animate with multiple elements, for example $(elem1, elem2).animate(); what does 'this' hold in the 'complete' callback?
[04:24:50] <Lomex> I do sometthing like if ($(this).hasClass('active')) { $(this).removeClass('active'); }
[04:24:52] <Lomex> How can this fail? :D
[04:25:00] <Anticom> aaairc: same i found few seconds ago, but thanks anyway (=
[04:25:26] <stenno> Lomex, what does: console.log($(this)); give?
[04:25:46] <aaairc> Anticom: np
[04:25:51] <Lomex> It goes into the if-block. So it for sure has the active class
[04:25:53] <Lomex> I will check
[04:25:57] <crashev> what is the proper way of adding !important in jqeury ? I'm trying .css('cssText', 'left: 50px !important') but the result is style="left: 50px ! important"
[04:26:01] <crashev> ?
[04:26:06] <stenno> Lomex, strange
[04:26:41] <stenno> Lomex, try: without the 'if': $(this).toggleClass('active');
[04:26:58] <stenno> but i am not sure why this should work
[04:27:23] <stenno> and the other one no
[04:27:24] <stenno> t
[04:28:48] <Lomex> lol
[04:28:54] <Lomex> I was stupid, I added the class later in the code again :D
[04:29:10] <stenno> >_>"
[04:29:14] <aaairc> Paveloosha: i still couldn't figure out how to get .load() to work... but i found this... http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/help.html#imagesloaded_plugin
[04:29:23] <reypa> hey does somebody know how to get rid of the "error loading page" in JQM or to disable error dialogs?
[04:29:47] <Lomex> stenno: Anyone thanks for your help. it works fine now ;)
[04:29:50] <stenno> any suggestions on my problem concerning animate?
[04:29:54] <stenno> np :)
[04:32:04] <Lomex> Is there a way to put a effect on show() hide() like floating in from the right/left or something like that?
[04:32:20] <Lomex> oh
[04:32:25] <Lomex> I found in the docs nervermind
[04:35:06] <bianchi> hi there, I can not set visibility property on div. Here is what i'm trying to do:
[04:35:09] <bianchi> $('#my_div').css('visibility', 'visible');
[04:35:09] <bianchi>                     $('#my_div').css('visibility');
[04:35:18] <AdvoWork> should $(".fc-event-title[title]")  match <span class="fc-event-title" title="this title?"> ?
[04:35:23] <Lomex> $("#comments").show('slow'); <- not showing up slow, anyone got an idea why?
[04:35:38] <bianchi> change last line with console.log($('#my_div').css('visibility'));
[04:35:40] <reypa> nobody knows how to get rid of the "error loading page" in JQM or to disable error dialogs?
[04:35:49] <bianchi> on firefox I get value, but on IE (9) I dont
[04:36:48] <stenno> reypa, well the 'error loading page' comes from the server side, doesn't it?
[04:36:57] <reypa> yes so?
[04:37:13] <stenno> so change your server settings to accept the route ...
[04:37:22] <reypa> stenno, well but it loads finde, jsut for a short time theres this dialog showing
[04:37:30] <reypa> *fine , just
[04:37:33] <stenno> huh
[04:37:40] <reypa> mobitest.coop.ch
[04:37:46] <Lomex> What can be the reason if show("slow") not showing up slow?
[04:37:46] <Lomex> :D
[04:38:01] <reypa> enter something and search it, with chrome or FF
[04:38:18] <reypa> stenno, (a place)
[04:38:42] <stenno> reypa, i don't get an error
[04:38:56] <reypa> stenno, browser?
[04:38:57] <stenno> i searched for Berlin and everything works fine
[04:39:14] <stenno> chrome 14.0.803.0 dev
[04:39:15] <Lomex> same to me
[04:39:27] <Lomex> google 13 beta
[04:39:31] <reypa> stenno, what? well i get it , just for a very very short time
[04:39:39] <stenno> it shows a 'loading' display shortly
[04:39:49] <Lomex> oh yes
[04:39:52] <Lomex> It shows "error loading page"
[04:39:54] <Lomex> and then it loads the page
[04:39:55] <Lomex> :D
[04:39:56] <reypa> stenno, yeah and then e error loading... hm do you have an iphone?
[04:40:04] <reypa> lomex, see
[04:40:18] <stenno> its too fast :)
[04:40:26] <stenno> its the split part of a second
[04:40:36] <Lomex> stenno: Do you know what can be wrong with show("slow") that the element is not showing up slow but in normal speed? :D
[04:40:37] <reypa> because its a mobile app, and on andriod it works well, but iOS and FF, and Chrome get this error
[04:40:42] <stenno> don't have an i[hoone
[04:40:54] <reypa> stenno, but now you saw it?
[04:41:05] <Lomex> ah it works now
[04:41:08] <stenno> i barely saw a loading dialog
[04:41:10] <stenno> Lomex, :)
[04:41:15] <Lomex> no idea why
[04:41:17] <Lomex> D
[04:41:18] <Lomex> :D
[04:41:32] <reypa> lomex, you saw the dialog? any idea?
[04:41:35] <crashev> anyone knows how to add !important in jquery to css attribute?
[04:41:42] <Lomex> reypa: Bin leider noob sorry :P
[04:41:49] <reypa> menno ;-)
[04:41:53] <bianchi> jquery can not set css visibility property on div in IE
[04:42:20] <stenno> crashev, $(elem).css({"left", "50px !important"});
[04:42:26] <stenno> (for example)
[04:42:44] <reypa> stenno, i think it is the google api callback, wich happens after the error handling, so i want to disable the error handling from jquery, and i cant find anything about that, or jsut the dialogs
[04:43:15] <stenno> hrmm
[04:43:40] <crashev> stenno: that will not work
[04:44:35] <crashev> not mentioning that the declartation has wrong syntax
[04:44:50] <stenno> ...
[04:44:54] <stenno> why wont that work
[04:45:52] <stenno> oh rigt
[04:45:58] <stenno> crashev, $(elem).css({"left": "50px !important"});
[04:46:42] <Kartagis> Aamir: are you there?
[04:46:47] <crashev> stenno: that will not work
[04:47:34] <stenno> maybe you have to write it in the css file with document.styleSheets ? i dunno how the browser handles !important things that are added on the fly
[04:48:15] <Lomex> Is there a way to activate that show() effect on elements whcih are already visible?
[04:49:26] <Paveloosha> <Lomex>, you can hide that just b4 you show it.. :)
[04:49:46] <Lomex> :D okay
[04:50:38] <crashev> stenno: I dont know either, looking for a way to put !important in jquery but eveyrthing I've tryed so far failed
[04:51:09] <stenno> crashev, so it doesn't work with document.styleSheets ?
[04:51:16] <Lomex> Paveloosha: Works fine thanks :)
[04:51:35] <stenno> maybe there is no other way then hardcoding the !important into the ccs
[04:51:38] <stenno> css
[04:52:39] <bianchi> can someone please tell me how to set css visibility property on div
[04:52:50] <bianchi> on IE just wont work
[04:52:55] <stenno> haha IE
[04:53:02] <JKarsrud> $('div').css('visibility', 'hidden'); ?
[04:53:07] <Paveloosha> <crashev>, you can try $(elem).css({"left": "50px; !important"}); ...... But I never tried it :)
[04:53:32] <stenno> Paveloosha, we just tried that
[04:53:52] <bianchi> JKarsrud, that works fine on ff, but IE ... for $('div').css('visibility') I get undefined :S
[04:55:09] <stenno> bianchi, what IE?
[04:55:15] <bianchi> IE 8 and IE 9
[04:55:34] <stenno> hmm strange
[04:56:16] <JKarsrud> what is it that you want to achieve tho?
[04:57:07] <bianchi> I want to show div that is by default hidden
[04:57:17] <bianchi> so, before everyting I do
[04:57:37] <bianchi> console.log($('div').css('visibility)); // returns hidden on ff, undefined on IE
[04:57:55] <bianchi> $('div').css('visibility','visible');
[04:57:55] <JKarsrud> try styleVisibility
[04:58:00] <JKarsrud> ?
[04:58:09] <JKarsrud> instead of just visibilty?
[04:58:15] <bianchi> let me try
[04:58:45] <JKarsrud> .css() should handle that itself, tho
[04:59:05] <JKarsrud> are you sure jQuery is loaded properly in IE tho?
[04:59:13] <JKarsrud> which version of jQuery are you using?
[04:59:15] <JKarsrud> 1.6.2?
[04:59:42] <Paveloosha> <stenno>, please check if it works, "var colorStyle = "50px !important"; $(elem).css({"left": colorStyle})".
[04:59:44] <bianchi> 1.5
[04:59:48] <bianchi> :S
[04:59:54] <JKarsrud> hmm
[05:01:12] <Paveloosha> or $(elem).css({"left": 50+"px"+" !important"})
[05:05:25] <Anticom> i seem to have an issue with .data() http://jsfiddle.net/rhUFB/
[05:05:48] <Anticom> the cancel-button won't work, after clicking the edit button
[05:08:54] <bianchi> it just wont work
[05:09:57] <Anticom> bianchi: why don't you use .show() and .hide() or .toggle() ?
[05:18:23] <Vespakoen> Hey guys, i have an array, something like this: ['a', 'c', 'b'] now i want to reverse it by keys, result should be => ['b', 'c', 'a'] but i want to know the original keys of the array too: [3,2,1]
[05:18:56] <Vespakoen> is it as easy as array.length - index when looping over it ?
[05:19:48] <Anticom> how do i convert a jqObject pointing to one DOM element to that DOM elment, to be able to attatch some data using .data() ?
[05:21:05] <Anticom> Vespakoen: i'd try using each and then replace the keys i with (array.lenth-i) and same with the values
[05:22:07] <Vespakoen> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']; b = a.reverse(); $.each(c, function(index, val) { console.log(a.lenth - index); });
[05:22:10] <Vespakoen> going to try this
[05:22:17] <Vespakoen> c = b
[05:23:49] <jeffsmykil> I know this has been done a million times before, but I'm trying to do it myself... what's the best way to get the current style sheet being used into a variable?
[05:25:35] <jeffsmykil> i only have one style sheet at a time
[05:28:39] <stenno> is there a way to get the 'left' attribute of a dom element without the 'px' ?
[05:29:08] <stenno> $(elem).css("left") gives me only the value with 'px'
[05:29:08] <jeffsmykil> yeah i think its in the documentation of the one that tells you how to get it with pixels stenno
[05:29:21] <jeffsmykil> i wish i could remember how
[05:29:35] <stenno> ok let me look, thanks
[05:29:44] <jeffsmykil> look up position
[05:29:47] <jeffsmykil> i think its in there
[05:29:55] <Paveloosha> <stenno>, var lt = parseInt($(elem).css("left"));
[05:30:06] <vhsjon> I am building up a form dynamically using jQuery, but when Im submitting the form, the jQuery.validate validation does not work. Ive checked out jQuery.live, but I don't think this is what I need. Does anybody have a tip on how to use jQuery.validate to validate dynamically built forms?
[05:30:53] <stenno> Paveloosha, that works, thanks
[05:31:06] <Paveloosha> welcome :)
[05:31:41] <guy> is there difference between .empty() and .html('')?
[05:32:07] <stenno> guy, no
[05:32:21] <jeffsmykil> Paveloosha: how would i go about finding out how many style sheets are on a page so I can run a for loop and put them in an array?
[05:32:23] <stenno> guy, its even said in the documentary to .html
[05:32:37] <stenno> jeffmess, document.styleSheets.length
[05:32:39] <stenno> oops
[05:32:47] <jeffsmykil> oh that works?
[05:32:48] <stenno> jeffsmykil, document.styleSheets.length
[05:32:49] <jeffsmykil> sweet
[05:32:52] <stenno> should
[05:33:05] <stenno> because document.styleSheets is an array
[05:33:25] <Paveloosha> should
[05:33:55] <aaairc> Paveloosha: any chance you could take a look at this:  http://jsfiddle.net/6vzJE/  . and tell me whats going on with the alerts
[05:34:00] <stenno> document.styleSheets.length
[05:34:01] <stenno> 5
[05:34:04] <jeffsmykil> var numberOfStyleSheets = document.styleSheets.length;
[05:34:12] <stenno> yeah
[05:34:33] <Paveloosha> @<aaairc>, np
[05:34:45] <jeffsmykil> hrm coming back undefined
[05:34:49] <jeffsmykil> but you have me started
[05:34:52] <stenno> huh
[05:34:54] <aaairc> i'm trying to use the imagesLoaded() thing i told you about... and it actually seems to be working, but i'm getting a really strange behavior, where alerts in the wrong click function are being called and multiple times for each click
[05:34:59] <stenno> i got the correct return value there
[05:35:05] <jeffsmykil> ok
[05:35:10] <jeffsmykil> must be something else in my code then
[05:35:11] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[05:35:13] <stenno> jeffsmykil, do you call it on $(document).ready ?
[05:35:18] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[05:35:29] <stenno> maybe it is not loaded yet
[05:35:30] <stenno> hmm
[05:36:00] <jeffsmykil> from the console it's just var numberOfStyleSheets right?
[05:36:16] <stenno> jeffsmykil, just try document.styleSheets.length;
[05:36:20] <stenno> in your console
[05:36:36] <jeffsmykil> yeah that returns the correct number
[05:36:38] <Frankie___> Hi to everyone
[05:36:56] <stenno> so var numStylesheets = document.styleSheets.length; should be correct
[05:36:59] <stenno> :)
[05:37:02] <Frankie___> Does anyone have ever had problems with links inside an Accordion ?
[05:37:19] <jeffsmykil> stenno you would think
[05:37:38] <Paveloosha> @<aaairc>, are you using this project only to learn or for your site. If you are going to use this for any live site, structure of your codes is not proper..
[05:38:04] <aaairc> i would like to incorporate it into a live site at some point
[05:38:11] <Paveloosha> you may face trouble in future..
[05:38:55] <stenno> jeffsmykil, :E
[05:38:59] <aaairc> Paveloosha: any chance you could be more specific?
[05:39:08] <stenno> are you resetting the variable at one point?
[05:39:40] <aaairc> Paveloosha: in regards to whats not proper... i'm still learning everything, so don't know what i'm doing wrong
[05:39:56] <Paveloosha> okay..
[05:40:05] <CerealWasTaken> aaairc: DRY
[05:40:24] <Paveloosha> I will do my best for you, if you have time
[05:41:04] <jeffsmykil> stenno: stupid question
[05:41:09] <aaairc> Paveloosha: any tips you could give be great
[05:41:18] <jeffsmykil> var styleSheets[] = document.styleSheets
[05:41:19] <jeffsmykil> right?
[05:41:41] <aaairc> Paveloosha: I have time if you are able to give me tips
[05:41:41] <CerealWasTaken> aaairc: Your thing is the thing with the boxes right?
[05:41:45] <izepstan> hello someone know a jq plugin for a dropdown like this? http://de.swisscom.ch
[05:41:46] <aaairc> yeah
[05:41:57] <CerealWasTaken> You repeat yourself too much
[05:42:02] <Paveloosha> dont put eventListeners individually
[05:42:04] <izepstan> should darken the page and closable with a button
[05:42:04] <CerealWasTaken> That's essentailly it
[05:42:09] <Anticom> .hide("slow").remove(); will remove the dom element immediately instead of showing the fade out first... how can i fix that?
[05:42:15] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: http://jsfiddle.net/RgNFA/
[05:42:37] <CerealWasTaken> You should write one function for all of it, and pass it the thing you want to process.
[05:42:43] <Paveloosha> try to bind with them.. like BRB
[05:42:59] <jhine> Hi. How do I stop a button from submitting on click if javascript is being used?
[05:43:25] <CerealWasTaken> jhine: look into preventDefault
[05:43:27] <aaairc> I'm trying to understand why the alerts are all screwed up... if you click the blue div... you get more alerts than expected... and then if you click the red div, for some reason you get blue alerts
[05:43:28] <Anticom> jhine: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[05:43:33] <jhine> Thank you very much.
[05:43:34] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: ^
[05:44:09] <stenno> jeffsmykil, no, you don't need the []
[05:44:31] <stenno> so: var styleSheets = document.styleSheets; should be great
[05:44:32] <CerealWasTaken> jhine: I think you can return false in submit()
[05:46:04] <VictorCL2> ^^
[05:46:27] <CerealWasTaken> aaairc: First of all you have forgotten a dollar sign in the red clause
[05:46:37] <CerealWasTaken> box.something -> $box.something
[05:46:53] <VictorCL2> fuck at last I could solve my problem
[05:46:54] <VictorCL2> http://jsfiddle.net/expjp/8/
[05:46:56] <VictorCL2> took me all day
[05:46:57] <VictorCL2> ¬¬
[05:46:58] <CerealWasTaken> Hey, how do I show line numbers in jsfiddle?
[05:47:17] <VictorCL2> if you llook at that in ie7 .. and execut it ..the green border wont expand
[05:48:25] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: not sure how to show line numbers... but i see what you are talking about... http://jsfiddle.net/RgNFA/2/ should have the $ added in the red clause
[05:48:25] <budda> hi - i'm using the jui datepicker widget and wish to bind a new event to an existing datepicker.
[05:48:33] <VictorCL2> needed a min-height:1px .. to fix a bug on ie7
[05:48:45] <budda> $( ".selector" ).datepicker( "option", "disabled", true ); looks like how its done for options. but not events, such as 'onClose'
[05:48:50] <CerealWasTaken> aaairc: Exactly. That makes it more predictable but doesn't solve your problem.
[05:48:53] <budda> using .bind() didn't seem to work either.
[05:49:27] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: yeah
[05:49:28] <budda> looking in the ui.datepicker.js code the onCLose default points to a callback
[05:49:33] <budda> rather than an event
[05:49:41] <budda> but setting a callback as an option doesn't work.
[05:49:47] <edbaffei> hi guys.. i think am using $.each wrong.. please help http://dpaste.com/564951/
[05:49:55] <budda> am i overlooking some jui pattern?
[05:50:08] <CerealWasTaken> You're not declaring a callback in imagesLoaded; you're adding one. The problem is, when the event is called again, ALL the callbacks are called in order.
[05:50:14] <jeffsmykil> stenno my variable was out of scope heh
[05:50:58] <guy> I am told that doing for([..]){ $.hp.ul.append(li); } is a bad idea and that instead I should do append once the for() is over
[05:51:01] <guy> how do I do that>
[05:52:12] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: i'm trying to understand what that means... declaring versus adding a callback
[05:52:16] <CerealWasTaken> aaairc: What you should do is somehow "replace" the imagesLoaded callback of $box with the new one, not add a second callback. In short, you’re using imagesLoaded wrong.
[05:52:56] <CerealWasTaken> You want to SET the callback but you end up ADDING a second one. When the event is triggered (images in $box loaded,) all previous callbacks are called.
[05:53:40] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: ok that makes sense what your saying
[05:53:54] <CerealWasTaken> i'll try something and get back to you sec
[05:54:06] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: thanks!
[05:55:09] <guy> anyone?
[05:55:12] <Hooloovoo> guy: You keep adding all the stuff you want to append to a variable that exists outside the loop and then just append that variable.
[05:55:30] <Hooloovoo> guy: I'll pastebin a example.
[05:55:54] <guy> so; var foo = {}; for([..]){ foo.push(bar); } [..].append(foo)?
[05:56:21] <guy> though, yeah, pastebin will do since you've went to write it anyway. : )
[05:57:10] <Hooloovoo> guy: What you wrote will do
[05:57:19] <guy> can you show your example?
[05:57:27] <Hooloovoo> sure, but it looks like yours
[05:57:55] <Hooloovoo> http://pastebin.com/CL2MehWJ
[05:58:56] <guy> yeah, but that's not the same, since I am using [HTMLObjects]
[05:59:02] <guy> (or similar they are called)
[05:59:17] <guy> https://gist.github.com/757e6b75c57f16bb50b5
[05:59:20] <guy> here is the example
[05:59:28] <CerealWasTaken> aaairc: This works and is the better way to do it, but I'm not sure your coding style will work on larger scale: http://jsfiddle.net/cerealmostly/RgNFA/4/
[05:59:52] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: checking it out now
[06:00:01] <Hooloovoo> guy: Gotta go for 20 mins. If you haven't solved it when i get back i'll help ya.
[06:00:09] <jhine> if I have <dt>foo</dt><dd>bar</dd> $('dd').click(function() { }); how can I select the previous dt before the dd?
[06:00:47] <guy> jhine: $(this).prev('dd')
[06:00:49] <guy> I think
[06:02:51] <jeffsmykil> any insite why this wouldn't work?
[06:02:52] <jeffsmykil> alert(styleSheetActive.getAttribute("title"));
[06:03:08] <jhine> ty
[06:04:52] <stenno> jeffsmykil, styleSheets don't have the method getAttribute
[06:04:55] <stenno> also, ##javascript
[06:08:17] <Anticom> .hide("slow").delay(500).remove(); won't work either... somehow the delay isn't applied =/
[06:08:25] <jeffsmykil> stenno finally got it
[06:08:30] <jeffsmykil> document.styleSheetSets;
[06:08:34] <jeffsmykil> ty
[06:08:56] <stenno> what is Sets?
[06:09:08] <jeffsmykil> gives you an array of the titles of the css files
[06:10:28] <stenno> jeffsmykil, i get undefined with chrome 14 dev
[06:10:42] <jeffsmykil> stenno works for me in ff
[06:10:43] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[06:10:53] <aaairc> CerealWasTaken: thanks for taking the time to show me this. experimenting with it to make sure i understand everything u did.
[06:11:02] <CerealWasTaken> Anytime.
[06:15:59] <Frankie___> Hi EveryOney. I have this problem : links defined inside a Jquery Accordion Don't Work. Could someone help Me ?  Thanks
[06:16:07] <reypa> somebody expirience with JQM Forms and ajax
[06:19:08] <stenno> Frankie___, If you have links inside the accordion content and use a-elements as headers, add a class to them and use that as the header, eg. header: 'a.header'.
[06:19:30] <stenno> Frankie___, are you doing that?
[06:20:20] <Frankie___> no, my inner links are of class a#update_link while my accrodion header is h1
[06:21:18] <Frankie___> thank you stenno
[06:22:01] <Frankie___> i'm not so sure i have understood what header: 'a.header' you refear, the accorion's right ?
[06:22:59] <stenno> Frankie___, i copy&pasted it from http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion, i never used it myself ... header seems to refer to the accordeon header, yes
[06:23:23] <jeffsmykil> hiow do i target a style sheet as a dom element?
[06:23:23] <iaj> Is there an easy way to make sure that all input fields on a page are blank with jQuery?
[06:23:50] <jeffsmykil> this does not work
[06:23:50] <jeffsmykil> $('link[type=stylesheet][title=new]').remove;
[06:24:23] <stenno> jeffsmykil, what is that title attribute? i didn't know stylesheets could have titles...
[06:24:31] <stenno> is it like, the filename?
[06:24:39] <jeffsmykil> yeah they can
[06:26:01] <stenno> you could a;ways do $(document.styleSheets[index of stylesheet]).remove(); that might work
[06:26:02] <jeffsmykil> this doesnt work either
[06:26:03] <jeffsmykil>  $('link[@rel=stylesheet][title=new]').remove;
[06:26:17] <Frankie___> @stenno thanks, that sentence is not that clear
[06:26:47] <stenno> if that doesn't work, try $(document.styleSheets[index of stylesheet].rules).remove();
[06:27:03] <guy> I need to select all ul.find('li') but the one that I have like $(this). [$(this) is equal to one of those LI elements]
[06:27:04] <stenno> i am just guessing though
[06:27:12] <guy> how?
[06:27:26] <jeffsmykil> stenno: so am i so its all good
[06:27:32] <stenno> :)
[06:28:01] <stenno> so far i only used document.styleSheets[index].removeRule or something like that
[06:28:16] <jeffsmykil> oh wait
[06:28:17] <jeffsmykil>  $('link[@rel=stylesheet][title=new]').remove();
[06:28:20] <jeffsmykil> that worked
[06:28:25] <stenno> ah!
[06:28:38] <stenno> but does it reload the page after that without the styles?
[06:28:54] <stenno> or does it apply the changes directly...?
[06:28:59] <Paveloosha> @<guy>, your requirment is not so clear for me..
[06:29:00] <jeffsmykil> directly
[06:29:18] <guy> Paveloosha: it was ul.find('li').not(li)
[06:29:33] <stenno> sweet
[06:30:45] <jeffsmykil> stenno unfortunately appending a new one does not have the same effect
[06:30:47] <Paveloosha> @<guy>, you can use $(this) only when you are doing somthing with that perticular element..
[06:31:08] <freakboy3742> I've got an interesting problem, and I'm not sure if it's user error, intended behavior, or bug
[06:31:22] <stenno> jeffsmykil, :/
[06:31:29] <freakboy3742> I'm making an $.ajax() call, and I have both an error and success handler defined
[06:31:42] <jeffsmykil> stenno it might be cookie time :/
[06:31:45] <freakboy3742> The error handler works fine for 4XX/5XX errors
[06:32:11] <freakboy3742> but if the server actually dies (i.e., kill the server, or unplug the network cable), the *success* handler is fired
[06:32:21] <freakboy3742> and jqXHR.status has a value of 0
[06:32:25] <Paveloosha> like $('ul li').each(function(){$(this).html()})
[06:33:00] <freakboy3742> Am I missing something here?  Why is "there is no server" a "success" as far as $.ajax() is concerned?
[06:36:16] <stenno> freakboy3742, i get the following:
[06:36:19] <stenno> $.ajax({url: "http://nonexistanturl.tld", success: function() {console.log("works");}, error: function() {console.log("zomg error");}});
[06:36:19] <stenno> Object
[06:36:19] <stenno> zomg error
[06:37:05] <freakboy3742> stenno: It's not just non-existent URL -- it's a dead server
[06:37:26] <Flesje> i have some links in a row, now when i click link 1 i want to show some div on the page
[06:37:41] <stenno> freakboy3742, isn't that the same in that case? a server where don't get a response..?>
[06:37:41] <freakboy3742> I'm seeing this in the wild on a mobile device, but I can simulate it by loading a page at a URL, doing the AJAX on a button press, but shutting down the server before pressing the button
[06:37:41] <Flesje> then when i click link 2 i want to show div 2 that is on the page, but div 1 should hide
[06:37:45] <Flesje> how cana i do that?
[06:38:04] <freakboy3742> stenno: Well, I would have thought so. Hence my confusion :-)
[06:38:23] <freakboy3742> But I'm definitely not seeing an error, I'm getting success with jqXHR.status=0
[06:38:26] <stenno> what is the actual request response?
[06:38:32] <mattems> xampp
[06:38:38] <mattems> sorry
[06:38:44] <stenno> can you display the xhr request in your developer console
[06:38:46] <stenno> ?
[06:39:00] <Paveloosha> @<Flesje>, you should use a variable to store current div temporary..
[06:39:09] <freakboy3742> stenno: I can - give me a sec to pull one up.
[06:39:56] <Flesje> Paveloosha i need some script as example as i'm a beginner and dont know where to start
[06:40:51] <freakboy3742> stenno: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/433319/
[06:40:55] <CerealWasTaken> Flesje: I can show you if you paste your code on jsfiddle.com
[06:41:08] <stenno> freakboy3742, i will look at it in a minute, brb
[06:41:17] <freakboy3742> stenno: For the record, this is JQuery 1.4.2
[06:41:21] <CerealWasTaken> Flesje: that is jsfiddle.net sorry
[06:41:27] <freakboy3742> stenno: NP
[06:41:37] <Flesje> well dont have really a code
[06:42:44] <Paveloosha> <Flesje>, var prevDiv = null; if(prevDiv!=null){prevDiv.hide()}; $(this).show(); prevDiv = $(this);
[06:43:04] <Flesje> CerealWasTaken http://jsfiddle.net/UYpYa/
[06:43:18] <Flesje> that is what i have, but now the divs correspondending to the #link1 should only show when clicked
[06:43:34] <Flesje> when clicked on link1 it should show link1 div, if clicked on 2 it should show only link2 div and hide div1
[06:46:21] <guy> how do I know which line is faster? https://gist.github.com/d86c498111b74cf8ed35
[06:47:06] <thisisalongnickn> trying to get the nearest 'big' link to change class on click of 'live': http://jsfiddle.net/hBWAb/
[06:49:25] <thisisalongnickn> I can't find the right selector :/
[06:49:41] <thisisalongnickn> find/closest/parent/etc.....
[06:49:55] <Rushing> one sec thisisalongnickn
[06:50:03] <thisisalongnickn> cheers
[06:50:11] <stenno> freakboy3742, it seems status code implies an error: The status attribute must return the result of running these steps:
[06:50:11] <stenno> If the state is UNSENT or OPENED return 0 and terminate these steps.
[06:50:11] <stenno> If the error flag is true return 0 and terminate these steps.
[06:50:11] <stenno> Return the HTTP status code
[06:50:30] <Rushing> http://jsfiddle.net/hBWAb/2/
[06:50:37] <Rushing> ^^ thisisalongnickn
[06:51:01] <freakboy3742> stenno: Well, it may imply an error, and an error would certainly make sense, but it's the success handler that's being fired.
[06:51:07] <thisisalongnickn> ahaaaaa. gotta play two pokemon at the same time. cheers!
[06:51:32] <freakboy3742> stenno: i.e., I just got that debug trace by putting a breakpoint in my success handler.
[06:51:41] <Rushing> basically, you were using "closest" wrong. it gets the nearest _parent_, so then you look for the .big child
[06:51:48] <stenno> freakboy3742, OTOH ready state 4 implies success... maybe you need to check in the success handler itself :(
[06:51:52] <stenno> yeah
[06:52:08] <stenno> freakboy3742, no wait
[06:52:18] <thisisalongnickn> logical. just thought there was a selector to get you there in one step
[06:52:35] <Rushing> well it's still one line ;)
[06:52:43] <edbaffei> hi guys.. i have list og li elements i'd like to ad an extra li element inbetween each.. how do i do this http://dpaste.com/564951/
[06:52:59] <Rushing> .closest(".head").children(".big")
[06:53:01] <stenno> freakboy3742, check http://www.xul.fr/en-xml-ajax.html section "Examples > get a text" ... but i don't see a way to let the error handler trigger instead of success
[06:53:06] <stenno> freakboy3742, i would call bug
[06:53:21] <freakboy3742> stenno: Righto. One bug report coming up :-)
[06:53:43] <freakboy3742> stenno: Might try an updated version of jquery first to see if it has been fixed along the way
[06:53:54] <stenno> right!
[06:54:10] <CerealWasTaken> Flesje: http://jsfiddle.net/cerealmostly/UYpYa/1/
[06:55:12] <CerealWasTaken> Flesje: Nice and easy?
[06:56:32] <skylamer`> goooooooooooood stuffz cereal
[06:59:30] <guy> so if I want to know which LI it is in the <ul> $(this).prevAll('li').length
[06:59:31] <guy> is the best/only option?
[07:00:21] <stenno> guy, maybe give the li's a class or id?
[07:00:40] <guy> would .data('i', i) be better?
[07:00:47] <iaj> Is there an easy way to make sure that all input fields on a page are blank with jQuery?  will a jQuery('input').clear() do?
[07:01:52] <stenno> iaj, sounds good
[07:04:25] <ElGoorf> http://pastebin.com/KkKx6P9p   <-- from lines 5/6, i have an event i want to happen on a click, but instead it's happening on pageload?
[07:05:04] <iaj> hmmm stenno TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'clear'  :(
[07:05:26] <stenno> iaj, sec
[07:06:31] <iaj> stenno; jQuery('input').val("");
[07:06:35] <iaj> did the job :)
[07:07:14] <stenno> iaj, right, that was my attempt too :)
[07:07:20] <WebGear> guys is there a way to inspect Javascript/jQuery that acts on elemnts the same way we would inspect CSS with firebug so i know what script/s acting on an elemnt?
[07:07:26] <stenno> just tried it out and it worked good
[07:07:48] <keirlavelle> i know its not jquery related but can anyone offer any sort of explanation as to how this website http://www.seismic-analysis.co.uk/default.aspx has a pr of 3? its LD from yahoo site explorer is showing 2 backlinks from crap sources!
[07:08:03] <Rushing> ?FireQuery @ WebGear
[07:08:03] <bot-t> WebGear, FireQuery is a Firebug extension for jQuery development - http://firequery.binaryage.com/

[07:08:16] <WebGear> thanks
[07:08:23] <stenno> join #SEO
[07:15:19] <iaj> jQuery('input#1435').focus();       < sth wrong about that one?
[07:16:50] <skylamer`> iaj depends where r u using it : )
[07:17:56] <stenno> iaj, just a general hint: you can use '$' instead of 'jQuery', so $('input#1435') is the same as jQuery('input#1435')
[07:18:10] <iaj> stenno; hmmm well through typo3 there is prototype as well
[07:18:11] <iaj> I think
[07:18:23] <iaj> That caused problem so I got used to jQuery(...)
[07:18:56] <stenno> ugh,  you are using prototype and jquery at the same time...?
[07:18:57] <iaj> Hmm, I'm trying to focus the Straße field on http://www.marcgalal.com/hoerbuch_danke.php   but I dont suceed with jQuery('input#1435').focus();  why :D
[07:18:59] <freakboy3742> stenno: Ok - looks like it's a resolved problem.
[07:19:13] <stenno> freakboy3742, sweet
[07:19:48] <kborchers> iaj: because your id is uid1435 not 1435
[07:20:14] <freakboy3742> 1.4.2 has the problem; 1.4.3 returns an error (with an undefined error message); 1.5.2 and 1.6.2 returns an error with an empty string error message.
[07:21:01] <stenno> freakboy3742, is there a reason why you still need 1.4.2 ?
[07:21:08] <iaj> kborchers; hmm even with uid1435 it aint working :(
[07:21:14] <deadowl> for some reason <a onclick="return false;" ...> will prevent following the link, but $("a").click(function () { return false; }); doesn't. In fact, I don't think it even gets executed. Anyone want to help me out?
[07:21:20] <freakboy3742> It's the version that comes out of the box with jQTouch
[07:21:45] <freakboy3742> stenno: I dont' know how forward compatible jQTouch is -- that's my next problem.
[07:21:53] <stenno> :<
[07:22:07] <freakboy3742> But for now, at least I (1) know it's a resolved problem, and (2) have a couple of workarounds.
[07:22:10] <freakboy3742> stenno: Thanks for the help
[07:22:13] <stenno> a workaround might be to check in the success handler, although its ugly
[07:22:16] <stenno> no problem at all
[07:22:39] <freakboy3742> stenno: Yeah - that's the workaround I already had; now I get to see if I can delete some code by updating to jQuery 1.4.3 :-)
[07:23:14] <stenno> :)
[07:23:27] <kborchers> iaj: hmm it may depend on when you are calling it. are you waiting for dom ready?
[07:23:41] <gym_jane> Refused to execute a JavaScript script. Source code of script found within request. :(
[07:23:49] <iaj> Oh, focus is only targetting a specified element - no way to go to a input field, eg to insertion mode?
[07:24:38] <kborchers> iaj: if you focus a text input, it should be ready for keyboard input
[07:24:59] <iaj> kborchers; strange it doesn't do that :)
[07:28:36] <kborchers> iaj: not sure if this is the problem but you only need jQuery(document).ready... or jQuery(function()... not both. try removing one of those from around your focus call
[07:30:51] <iaj> kborchers; thats sufficient?  http://pastebin.com/dXx4C9S2
[07:31:03] <kborchers> yes
[07:31:22] <iaj> that's not the problem though, but thanks :)
[07:31:26] <iaj> had that as a snippet
[07:31:55] <skylamer`> from which version u put 'jquery' in front ?
[07:32:33] <iaj> Huh.. dunno... 1.5.x
[07:33:13] <kborchers> iaj: hmmm, not sure then. only other thing i can think of is that i wouldn't put script tags inside of a div. can you move that into the head or at least up to just inside body (top or bottom) so it isn't inside your page structure?
[07:33:46] <iaj> kborchers; I even tried in console.. no success :-(
[07:33:52] <reypa> stenno, you here?
[07:34:15] <stenno> reypa, yeah
[07:34:27] <kborchers> iaj: very strange. i'm not sure, sorry
[07:34:32] <reypa> stenno, remeber me? the guy with the error dialog problem
[07:34:36] <reypa> well i sovled it
[07:34:38] <wesbos> Does anyone have a vector file, or at least highres, of the jQuery UI icons?
[07:34:44] <stenno> reypa, cool!
[07:34:49] <stenno> where was the problem..?
[07:35:41] <reypa> stenno, well i don't knor, it didn't happen when i made a timeout for 1s, but now i just overrote the css off the ui-loader, and the error dialogs are affected too xD
[07:36:02] <reypa> not perfect but hey
[07:36:16] <stenno> hehe nice
[07:36:57] <reypa> the problem is that the jqm tries to open every link with ajax i think... but it was a normal post form so it threw the error
[07:38:45] <mazzachre> If I want to use trigger and the data I want to send to the event handler is an array of something, what to do? If I just do $('#test').trigger('plonk', [1,2,3]); and the $('#test').bind('plonk', function(event, data) {alert(JSON.stringify(data));}); Will alert me "1"
[07:40:16] <mazzachre> The event handler should needs an arbitrary length array... I have no idea how much or how little data is provided for plonk
[07:44:36] <Frankie___> \msg stenno Thank you Very much for the link inside the accordion problem : Solved
[07:45:48] <stenno> Frankie, no problem :P
[07:45:56] <wao> hello
[07:46:23] <wao> I have select, and when I select some option from it, I want to fill it up some inputs, any idea how to do it?
[07:49:18] <guy> guys, I need some help with the animation. http://anuary.com/dev/hp/pad3/ it is glitchy when dragging. Any suggestions how to improve it?
[07:50:00] <Rushing> talking to yourself in plural third person again?
[07:50:28] <guy> hilarious.
[07:50:38] <Rushing> i do that
[07:50:59] <Rushing> my guess is that you just have alot of images there
[07:51:35] <Rushing> the functionality also seems a little quirky...like if i rollover the left or right i don't know how many images will pass
[07:52:00] <Rushing> so the transition might be being triggered/stopped more than it ought to be
[07:52:14] <guy> there is throttling of 500 ms, Rushing on that
[07:53:22] <Rushing> can you expand the rollover hotspot so that it's on the visible image?
[07:53:29] <keirlavelle> are there any active seo rooms anyone can recommend?
[07:53:40] <Rushing> the transition is so quick that when you roll to the right, you don't have time to move the mouse away before it triggers the next
[07:54:23] <Rushing> keirlavelle, did you try ##seo?
[07:54:54] <stenno> keirlavelle, #SEO , redirects to ##seo
[07:54:56] <stenno> ah
[07:55:05] <keirlavelle> rushing: tried it, pretty dead
[07:55:10] <stenno> sorry Rushing didn't see you already typed it
[07:55:43] <Rushing> well there are alot of people there, so it's probably your best bet :P wait until you see a convo and pounce!
[07:57:27] <guy> Rushing: ok, I've increased the throttling
[08:00:00] <gym_jane> why am i getting Refused to execute a JavaScript script. Source code of script found within request.

[08:04:28] <doncams> hey jquery gods
[08:04:31] <aaronmcadam> any ideas?
[08:05:38] <stenno> aaronmcadam, ##javascript :P
[08:05:46] <aaronmcadam> is that an overflow channel?
[08:06:00] <stenno> overflow?
[08:06:03] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[08:06:04] <skramy> I have a ul#items with a bunch of li's and each li has a element that contains a number. How would I best have jquery reorder the lis for me based on the numeric order
[08:06:19] <aaronmcadam> php has one because #php is always full
[08:06:30] <stenno> #php is invite only
[08:06:40] <aaronmcadam> probably for the best :D
[08:06:40] <stenno> because of that reason?
[08:06:42] <stenno> hehe
[08:06:48] <quicksilver> no. ## is because it's a non official channel
[08:06:50] <aaronmcadam> i don't want an invite
[08:06:50] <stenno> who needs php anyway
[08:06:53] <quicksilver> freenode policy.
[08:06:53] <stenno> ah

[08:38:47] <neymar92> hello
[08:40:04] <neymar92> could any body explain me why the delegate function only works if the script is inside the container of the element you want to manipulate?
[08:40:17] <Mindore> having issues with Cufon Flash of Unstyled Content. Did test cufon.now() before </body>. Any other tips?
[08:42:58] <neymar92> for example....
[08:43:00] <neymar92> http://jsfiddle.net/rQVpZ/
[08:43:11] <neymar92> this doesn't work with delegate but works with live
[08:43:26] <neymar92> but if i put the delegate function inside the body
[08:43:28] <neymar92> works just fine
[08:43:54] <Mindore> i tried visibility: hidden in css and visibility: visible on document.ready... no Fouc but my links got backgroundimages so its fucked up anyway :)
[08:47:09] <Ignition-IRC> hi all, can anyone point me towards a good jqueryui plugin for tables?
[08:48:08] <ryanneufeld> isn't one yet....
[08:48:18] <ryanneufeld> 1.9 will have one
[08:48:24] <guy> is it possible to force mouse stop dragging using JS?
[08:48:26] <ryanneufeld> I'm eagerly awaiting that
[08:48:49] <Ignition-IRC> is development underway in the git repo?
[08:48:51] <ryanneufeld> guy, you mean prevent somone from dragging something with the mouse?
[08:49:00] <ryanneufeld> Ignition-IRC: yes
[08:49:22] <guy> ryanneufeld: no. the person already started dragging, but I need to force him stop dragging after, say 2 s or when he enters some e.target
[08:49:23] <Ignition-IRC> ryanneufeld: thanks i'll take a look how stable it is
[08:49:39] <guy> ryanneufeld: the issue is described here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6626717/javascript-force-drag-release in more depth
[08:50:04] <ryanneufeld> hmm, I don't know about that
[08:50:59] <ryanneufeld> you'd almost need customized drag code (the bit that changes the elements top, left values) to restrict movement beyond a bounding box
[08:51:39] <ryanneufeld> you could use a setTimeout to deactivate the drag binding as well
[08:52:14] <djQuery> Ignition-IRC: jqgrid
[08:53:51] <guy> ryanneufeld: yeah, so that's what I am asking
[08:54:06] <guy> is it possible to deactivate drag binding temporary
[08:54:07] <ryanneufeld> then you have your answer
[08:54:19] <ryanneufeld> that's up to you
[08:54:33] <ryanneufeld> you could set the timeout to trigger the dragend on that element
[08:54:53] <ryanneufeld> or whatever the event is
[08:54:58] <ryanneufeld> depends on how you're doing it
[08:55:11] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano would be the better guy to ask about that

[09:01:45] <k1t> Anticom: make one
[09:01:46] <k1t> :X
[09:02:06] <k1t> or get one thats almost compatible and make it compatible
[09:02:06] <k1t> lol
[09:02:17] <Anticom> k1t: unfortunatelly most companies don't realize, that IE6 obviously sucks
[09:03:04] <systemfault> They realize, they don't care.
[09:03:28] <systemfault> IE6 was the browser that was shipped with XP and that's the one they'll use until they change the OS
[09:03:44] <systemfault> XP's EOL is on April 8th 2014
[09:04:20] <Anticom> systemfault: agree, but that still doesn't solve my problem now :(
[09:05:02] <Anticom> is there an extra chan for jq-ui?
[09:05:08] <Anticom> maybe they can help

[09:11:37] <pootpoot> my jQuery('.my-click-class').click() isnt functioning on wp posts that have been added dynamically with ajax after initial page load
[09:11:42] <pootpoot> does anyone know why this could be?
[09:15:35] <BlaDe^> with: $("ul li.parent a").each(function() { } ); --- how can I check a) how many were selected (i.e. selector.length) and what index $(this) is within that loop?
[09:15:40] <peb7268> I need some help plz!
[09:15:59] <BlaDe^> pootpoot use $('.selector').live('click', function() { });
[09:16:10] <pootpoot> live?
[09:16:14] <pootpoot> ive never heard of that
[09:16:14] <BlaDe^> yes
[09:16:15] <peb7268> my query is firing on this page but not on other pages with the same script and all the same files are being included. Any ideas? http://smartpathfinancial.com/results/
[09:16:17] <BlaDe^> now you have
[09:16:26] <pootpoot> it sounds strange and scary
[09:16:32] <pootpoot> what is it?
[09:16:38] <BlaDe^> heh nah it just means that if the dom has changed after the page load it'll still work
[09:16:43] <peb7268> fires on that page when you click see more articles in the sidebar but not on this page: http://smartpathfinancial.com/about/
[09:16:44] <BlaDe^> read the docs
[09:16:59] <pootpoot> peb7268: jQuery.each( collection, callback(indexInArray, valueOfElement) )
[09:17:30] <pootpoot> oops i meant BlaDe^
[09:18:08] <BlaDe^> thanks :)
[09:18:09] <pootpoot> $("ul li.parent a").each(function(index, element) { } );
[09:18:47] <peb7268> I don't see how that applies to this simple situation $('#see_more_articles').click(function(){
[09:18:48] <peb7268> 	
[09:18:48] <peb7268> 	$('.extraArticles').slideDown();
[09:18:48] <peb7268> 	$('#see_more_articles').fadeOut();
[09:18:48] <peb7268> 	$('.hide_on_click').hide();
[09:18:49] <peb7268> 	return false;	
[09:18:49] <peb7268> })
[09:19:23] <peb7268> I read that doc on the jquery and I don't see how to apply that to this. I am sure I am missing something
[09:19:35] <peb7268> ; <<-- goes above
[09:21:03] <pootpoot> so even if you set a $('.thing').click(function() ) inside $onReady() ..... you still have to listen for future dom changes?
[09:21:10] <pootpoot> its not like for classes now and in the future
[09:21:29] <pootpoot> it must register all the elements with that class that exist now

[09:40:33] <Rushing> usually i refresh and it's gone, so i think it's a browser quirk
[09:41:09] <swiggy> well it is effecting my page
[09:41:44] <Rushing> technically, jquery is instantiaed in the window scope if the page its included on, so it's not doing any magic on how it is declared
[09:42:04] <Rushing> swiggy, do you have a link?

[09:43:33] <ScottO_> whats the proper way to use a value from a field in an object?
[09:43:46] <aFtAb> Hello, i m using colorpicker plugin on my site and it required type to be color like this <input type="color" id="bgcolor" /> and it loads the color picker fine but when i try to select it using jquery like this $("#bgcolor"); it says: No elements were found with the selector: "#bgcolor"
[09:43:54] <ScottO_> myObject.{$(')}.soemthing
[09:44:08] <Vorspire> ScottO_ - object['field'] or object.field both should work
[09:44:12] <ScottO_> not sure what the syntax is
[09:44:42] <ScottO_> Vorspire: need to use the value of a field to specify which port of the object to look in
[09:45:15] <ScottO_> myObject.2.something  need to have $('#myField').val() in there
[09:45:46] <Rushing> myObject[$("#field").val()]...
[09:45:58] <ScottO_> can i mix and match [] with .. ?
[09:46:09] <ScottO_> myObject[blah].soemthing ?
[09:46:22] <Vorspire> there are a lot of ways to do what you want
[09:46:30] <Rushing> you'll probably want to preceed that with a if($("#field").val() && ($("#field").val() in myObject)) first though
[09:46:31] <Vorspire> its a matter of preference
[09:47:45] <ScottO_> well im just checking for true or false in the object value, so if it returns false because ti doesnt exist then thats fine
[09:47:59] <ScottO_> so no checking the field value or the object key necessary
[09:48:05] <ScottO_> thanks!
[09:48:59] <Rushing> IE might not like that...might want to make sure
[09:50:20] <ScottO_> Rushing: yeah i will be testing IE later
[09:52:55] <ScottO_> guess 0 and 1 dont mean true or false in js?
[09:53:02] <ScottO_> reverse that :P
[09:56:10] <Rushing> they do, ScottO_, but if the property is not defined on an object, that is undefined, not 0 or 1
[09:59:02] <Vorspire> ScottO_ use object type comparisons for verification: obj === "some string" //obj must be of type string and match "swome strin" - same applies to all other native data objects
[09:59:24] <Vorspire> excuse the typo's im on a wireless keyboard :/
[10:01:54] <gratnam11> hi i found this example i like to use
[10:01:57] <gratnam11> http://jsfiddle.net/Town/Jxgwa/
[10:02:29] <gratnam11> how do i link the .js file for that
[10:05:19] <BMCouto> Hi, how to i say in a selector, class that begins with .firstLetter … ?
[10:05:58] <fuchstronaut> classes can't begin with a dot
[10:06:58] <Matthieu_> Hi everyone - First of all, sorry, I'm a noob a jquery - Anyway I'm trying to find out why my OS/X server doesn't display any jquery and especially jgrids on served webpages... That looks really weird, the placeholders are simply blank. Anyone wanting to have a look ?
[10:07:41] <fuchstronaut> is there something like a map-plugin for jquery? i want to mark certain places on a map (jpeg or png)?
[10:08:06] <sic1> Matthieu_ sounds like a possible issue with local paths vs server paths on your jquery of some sort...
[10:08:44] <sic1> fuchstronaut: a map? like google maps?
[10:09:23] <Matthieu_> Thanks sic1: mmmh even with relative paths ? I tried those sample files http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/downloads/jqgrid_demo.zip - they don't work either
[10:09:57] <fuchstronaut> sic1: something like this: http://lexikon.freenet.de/images/de/thumb/2/2c/Karte_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland.svg/300px-Karte_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland.svg.png
[10:10:18] <fuchstronaut> i want to flag some locations
[10:11:02] <sic1> oh, well at that point u just need to do some css it sounds like
[10:11:24] <sic1> umm, i mean, im not sure what kinda end producut ur seeing here
[10:11:46] <fuchstronaut> ill google one :)
[10:11:50] <sic1> but in my mind, if u got ur image (a map), itsjust a matter of z-index and placing ur markers on ur map with abolutle positioning
[10:12:07] <fuchstronaut> i thought about that
[10:12:24] <sic1> now the complicated answer would be to use google maps, and use that image as an overlay of the real area, then plot ur points using google maps markers
[10:12:32] <sic1> all possible
[10:12:36] <Matthieu_> Regarding my jggrid problem : here is a live example :http://museboostinglabs.no-ip.org:8888/test/adding.html
[10:12:38] <sic1> hell, they give an example
[10:12:41] <fuchstronaut> but then i thpught there might be some super-smart plugin that'll search in gmaps for zipcodes and mark it for me :)
[10:12:56] <sic1> heh
[10:13:10] <melusinechan> hello
[10:13:11] <sic1> it all takes some code somewhere...just a matter of if someone made a plugin for u or not
[10:13:22] <melusinechan> how can i get an hash from an url returning json
[10:13:24] <melusinechan> ?
[10:13:51] <melusinechan> s/an/a
[10:13:58] <skywaker> hola tendo una consulta con jquery datepicker,, help!!!
[10:14:11] <phishbot> yo no se
[10:14:13] <ngharo> Matthieu_: the error is obvious if you take a look at your console
[10:14:14] <sic1> fuchstronaut: here is a google maps example http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/overlay-simple.html
[10:14:23] <sic1> more here
[10:14:23] <sic1> http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/index.html
[10:14:36] <fuchstronaut> thanks ill read some of that
[10:14:40] <sic1> and melusinechan...not sure
[10:14:59] <sic1> window.location.hash
[10:15:11] <sic1> other than that one, not sure
[10:15:21] <sic1> ok, now I have a question...
[10:15:37] <fuchstronaut> shoot
[10:15:45] <melusinechan> sic1: your answer doesn't make any sense to me
[10:16:12] <Cork[home]> melusinechan: you mean a hash on the server side?
[10:16:31] <Cork[home]> melusinechan: or do you mean a javascript object?
[10:16:33] <skywaker> el datepicker no funciona en una pagina publicada( asp )
[10:16:35] <sic1> say ive done an ajax call, it has returned data, im in my first level of done, in that done, i have determined that the data is actually bad, i want no more trailing dones to fire, but i want the fails to fire...how? :)
[10:16:37] <melusinechan> i'm looking for doing something like this : data = $.get(URL) => return json, data.to_hash()
[10:16:54] <Matthieu_> ngharo: ok... I looked at apache/error_log but nothing wrong - where should I look exactly ?
[10:17:02] <Cork[home]> melusinechan: i guess you mean JSON.parse()
[10:17:10] <ngharo> Matthieu_: i mean your browsers javascript console
[10:17:14] <Cork[home]> melusinechan: javascript doesn't have hashes
[10:17:23] <Cork[home]> melusinechan: thats ruby or perl
[10:17:26] <melusinechan> how do you call {} ?
[10:17:30] <Cork[home]> objects
[10:17:33] <Matthieu_> ngharo: ok let me see
[10:17:37] <ngharo> ?ftj @ Matthieu_
[10:17:37] <bot-t> Matthieu_, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:17:45] <smplstk> JSON.stringify
[10:18:01] <melusinechan> Cork[home]: Hash in ruby are object ^^
[10:18:05] <Matthieu_> bot-t: thanks
[10:18:05] <bot-t> Matthieu_, I'm a bot you know..
[10:18:21] <Matthieu_> hahaha
[10:18:22] <Cork[home]> ?eval JSON.parse('{"key":2}').key @ melusinechan
[10:18:23] <bot-t> melusinechan: 2
[10:18:28] <melusinechan> Cork[home]: hash table is more  patter i think
[10:18:51] <Cork[home]> melusinechan: i know what they are, but they don't exist in json or javascript
[10:18:52] <melusinechan> Cork[home]: i was more looking for some magic function that transform directly the json returned in a hash
[10:18:54] <melusinechan> but ok :p
[10:18:58] <melusinechan> i'll do that
[10:19:11] <Cork[home]> melusinechan: i showed you how its done
[10:19:25] <Cork[home]> melusinechan: but you can't get hashes, as they don't exist
[10:19:25] <melusinechan> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table
[10:19:29] <melusinechan> it's a hash ...
[10:19:39] <Cork[home]> sigh, i know what a hash are
[10:19:48] <Cork[home]> i write ruby quite a lot
[10:19:52] <smplstk> 'hash' and 'hash table' are not the same.
[10:20:07] <smplstk> 'hash' in context of URL's is #
[10:20:09] <melusinechan> smplstk: really, can you explain me the difference ?
[10:20:36] <Cork[home]> melusinechan: javascripts only relation to hash is the anchor direction in the url
[10:20:57] <Cork[home]> it doesn't has ruby hash maps perfectly to javascript objects
[10:21:02] <Cork[home]> as i showed you up there
[10:21:11] <Cork[home]> ?eval JSON.parse('{"key":2}') @ melusinechan
[10:21:13] <bot-t> melusinechan: {"key": 2}
[10:21:20] <Cork[home]> ?eval JSON.parse('{"key":2}').key @ melusinechan
[10:21:22] <bot-t> melusinechan: 2
[10:21:23] <melusinechan> ok
[10:21:27] <Cork[home]> or
[10:21:32] <Cork[home]> ?eval JSON.parse('{"key":2}')["key"] @ melusinechan
[10:21:33] <bot-t> melusinechan: 2
[10:21:39] <Cork[home]> if you prefer the ruby way
[10:23:46] <Matthieu_> ngharo: ok, got it, but please, have a look at this one : http://museboostinglabs.no-ip.org:8888/bluebox/
[10:24:07] <Matthieu_> ngharo: credentials : test@test.com | test123
[10:24:08] <Mindore> is it better to use selectors like .myclass or is it better to tell jquery where in the dom this class is like #page #main .myclass?
[10:24:24] <systemfault> Mindore: Depends
[10:24:39] <systemfault> Mindore: Using 2 ids in a selector is useless though
[10:24:44] <melusinechan> Cork[home]: to be honest i don't really understand the difference, and as long as the only name will be object i prefer call them hash, as wikipedia call them: Several dynamic languages, such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language), http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language), use hash tables to implement o
[10:24:45] <Mindore> true
[10:24:53] <Matthieu_> ngharo: go to Connecivity then Simple route - the jqgrid should appears just under that. No error in the console however
[10:24:55] <melusinechan> sorry to be so stubborn ^^
[10:25:16] <Mindore> but u got the point... more steps or as few as possible? to make it easy for jquery
[10:25:28] <systemfault> Mindore: Just "enough" is the best.
[10:25:42] <melusinechan> brb
[10:25:51] <smplstk> melusinechan :|
[10:26:11] <systemfault> Mindore: Usually, as few as possible.
[10:26:16] <smplstk> we're just saying 'hash' within the context of JS usually means #
[10:26:32] <melusinechan> so i should say hash table ?
[10:26:34] <skywaker> I have the following problem: jquery datepicker does not work on a published page (asp)
[10:26:34] <smplstk> hence everyone's confusion
[10:26:39] <Mindore> okok
[10:26:44] <melusinechan> smplstk: sorry i'm a bit tired ><
[10:26:51] <Mindore> read that using ids are a lot faster than classes
[10:26:54] <systemfault> melusinechan: What is the problem?
[10:27:09] <rewt> melusinechan, from one of the pages you linked to: " JavaScript objects are associative arrays, augmented with prototypes"
[10:27:15] <rewt> hash tables are just associative arrays
[10:27:16] <systemfault> Mindore: Nowadays, it's irrelevant
[10:27:17] <Mindore> any other things to think about when talking about selector optimization?
[10:27:33] <rewt> the difference between them is the "augmented with prototypes" part
[10:27:39] <skywaker> I have the following problem: jquery datepicker does not work on a published page (asp)
[10:27:42] <melusinechan> systemfault: nothing, i was confused by the difference between hash and hash table
[10:27:54] <melusinechan> i'm new to javascript ><
[10:27:58] <systemfault> Mindore: Of course, you should try to cache DOM nodes when possible so you don't select all the time
[10:27:59] <Vorspire> ?101
[10:28:00] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:28:14] <ngharo> Matthieu_: its hard to tell because your HTML has 0 line breaks
[10:28:19] <Mindore> systemfault: is that true for older versions like 1.3.2 too?
[10:28:22] <ngharo> but it appears the script is completely commented out
[10:28:32] <melusinechan> Vorspire: thx by advance :_
[10:28:37] <Vorspire> :)
[10:28:43] <smplstk> melusinechan: it's not JS, it's the english language, :D
[10:28:43] <smplstk> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#Other_names_in_English
[10:28:46] <sic1> ? in a deferred done chain (from an ajax call), how can you reject the deferred inside of the done so that then fails will be called instead of dones?
[10:28:49] <bot-t> sic1, Couldn't find "in a deferred done chain (from an ajax call), how can you reject the deferred inside of the done so that then fails will be called instead of dones?" in jQuery Docs.
[10:28:50] <Matthieu_> ngharo: want ssh to the machine ?
[10:28:51] <systemfault> Mindore: I don't use 1.3.2, so I haven't seen its source
[10:29:04] <skywaker> I have the following problem: jquery datepicker does not work on a published page (asp)
[10:29:04] <melusinechan> smplstk: ^^
[10:29:07] <smplstk> octothorpe
[10:29:33] <systemfault> Mindore: But nowadays, browser are fast enough for you to don't care about class VS ids
[10:29:37] <Vorspire> skywalker, you've said that 3 times now and the reason no one is helping is probably beause it's not even a question. :/
[10:29:37] <ngharo> Matthieu_: <script type="text/javascript">// < just take out those slashes
[10:29:38] <rewt> a hash also means a digest, as in md5, sha1, etc
[10:29:44] <Mindore> systemfault: okok. :)
[10:29:53] <systemfault> Mindore: jQuery, at least now, uses querySelector when possible.
[10:30:02] <smplstk> IT MEANS ALL THINGS
[10:30:04] <systemfault> Mindore: So it's plenty fast
[10:30:08] <Mindore> okok
[10:30:49] <Mindore> systemfault: How can i cache the dom nodes then?
[10:31:21] <skywaker> forgiveness
[10:31:31] <dualcore> skywaker: what type of published page? what cms are you using?
[10:32:03] <systemfault> Mindore: let's say you have multiple operations to do on a set of nodes... you would do: var nodes = $('.some-class');  nodes.stuff1(); nodes.stuff2(); instead of $('.some-class').stuff1(); $('.some-class').stuff2();
[10:32:32] <Vorspire> var nodes = $("*"); //nodes is your chache, whenever you want to access "*", just access nodes. this is a form of light caching, you can extend the jQuery scope with a new field/property that contains "nodes" in order to supply it to the global jQuery scope.
[10:32:46] <Mindore> systemfault: Ah okok
[10:32:56] <systemfault> Mindore: Also, see what Vorspire said :)
[10:33:04] <djQuery> Mindore: or even var nodes = $('.some-class').stuf1().stuff2();
[10:33:21] <systemfault> Yeah sure, chaining is another story :D
[10:34:25] <Vorspire> chaining is fun, but sometimes it can break... jQuery-UI .button() seems to break for me, so I never chain anything after that call :/
[10:34:25] <Mindore> interesting :)
[10:34:40] <skywaker> DualCore: I am using asp. and is "cmc"?
[10:35:37] <Mindore> having some problems with Flash of Unstyled Content...
[10:36:04] <Vorspire> Mindore, here's a nice example of light caching: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/msSGz/ the selector "handle" is cached for future use here
[10:36:05] <systemfault> Mindore: What are you trying to do? Is there a link we can see?
[10:36:05] <djQuery> Vorspire: think that has been fixed.
[10:36:13] <djQuery> Mindore: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/10-ways-to-instantly-increase-your-jquery-performance/
[10:36:23] <djQuery> #6 in particular
[10:36:29] <dualcore> skywaker: i use php and i've never heard of cmc.  is your cms using another conflicting javascript library?
[10:36:34] <Mindore> have tested Cufon.now() first/ last in body without success
[10:37:19] <systemfault> djQuery: Tip number 1 is naive at best.
[10:37:33] <systemfault> 3 is bad.
[10:37:41] <systemfault> 4 is very bad.
[10:37:56] <systemfault> 8 is bad.
[10:38:29] <Mindore> currently i have styletag in head with .js. { text-indent: -10000em; }
[10:38:40] <djQuery> systemfault: hmmm #9 is bad as well.   .preventDefault
[10:38:53] <systemfault> djQuery: Yeah, true
[10:39:11] <Mindore> $(document).ready(function() { $(".js").css("text-indent", "0"); });
[10:39:12] <Matthieu_> ngharo: I did it right in Firebug and that gave me a 'syntax error'
[10:39:14] <velts> hey does anyone know why .height() would return a different value in ie7 from all other browsers?
[10:39:16] <djQuery> sorry please disregard my earlier post.
[10:39:18] <Mindore> to reset it
[10:39:52] <systemfault> Mindore: Can't you write a stylesheet?
[10:40:01] <Mindore> sure
[10:40:12] <systemfault> Mindore: I missing the context there :P
[10:40:15] <Mindore> i guess there is no problem to put it in the stylesheet
[10:40:28] <Vorspire> Mindore, you don't actually need $(document).ready these days, you can replace it with $( :P
[10:40:36] <Vorspire> $(function(){ });
[10:40:38] <systemfault> Mindore: I mean, why is it like that at the beginning and why do you want to set it to 0?
[10:41:01] <Mindore> systemfault: because i got a flash of original font
[10:41:12] <systemfault> Ah! The legendary fout
[10:41:18] <Mindore> so i move the text with text-indent while replacing with cufon
[10:41:32] <Bentley> hi all, I have a .click event on a link. For it, I call event.preventDefault, which I believe should disable the link. Indeed, when I click the link it appears to be disabled in the browser (doesn't draw a new page). However, if I look at my apache access log, it does actually receive a GET request for the click
[10:41:56] <Mindore> systemfault: as i said... Flash of Unstyled Content :)
[10:42:20] <ryanneufeld> oh a FUC
[10:42:25] <Vorspire> Bentley, try calling .stopPropagation() too
[10:42:42] <Mindore> is there any better state to make this or is the document ready the best state?
[10:43:06] <systemfault> Mindore: And the tips on Paul Irish's website are not working?
[10:43:30] <systemfault> Mindore: .ready is the earliest time the DOM tree is complete
[10:44:03] <Mindore> systemfault: kok :)
[10:44:05] <Mindore> okok
[10:44:06] <Vorspire> (function($){ }(jQuery)); //Immediately-Executing Anonymous Function vs $(function(){ }); //Document.ready event
[10:44:11] <systemfault> Mindore: I haven't checked Paul's page but I wouldn't use .css
[10:44:19] <systemfault> Mindore: I'd remove a class
[10:44:47] <velts> hey does anyone know why .height(), .outerHeight and .innerHeight all return a different values in ie from all other browsers?
[10:44:54] <systemfault> Mindore: calling .css with multiple elements is going to be slow.
[10:45:01] <systemfault> s/with/on
[10:45:12] <Bentley> Vorspire: just tried that - apache still gets a request
[10:45:19] <Mindore> systemfault: Okok, thats helpful :)
[10:45:43] <hlveheart> Heyo
[10:45:51] <systemfault> Mindore: Actually, using .css should be avoided most of the time.
[10:46:02] <systemfault> Mindore: Except for animations for example.
[10:46:21] <Mindore> systemfault: okok, ill work with classes more then i guess
[10:46:50] <Vorspire> Yea, easy enough to supply a quick <style/> before your html elements to avoid .css calls
[10:48:10] <systemfault> Mindore: You could add a class to the body.. let's say: text-hidden  then in your CSS, you'd have ".text-hidden .superheaderwithlogo { visibility: hidden; }" then when loaded you would just remove .text-hidden from the body to reveal everything
[10:48:54] <Vorspire> could just add the class "ui-helper-hidden" if using jq-ui
[10:49:14] <Mindore> systemfault: yes i tried that. problem is i got links with css backgrounds :) thats why i use text-indent instead
[10:49:28] <systemfault> Ah ok, that would also work with that
[10:50:29] <hlveheart> Can anyone explain why this fails? http://jsfiddle.net/NjQQC/ Basically, I'm trying to have when you click one of the hrefs, add a class and remove the other
[10:50:43] <Mindore> issue now is that all links are gone for like 500ms
[10:52:10] <sic1> oh and if anyone was interested in the asnwer to my question ( changing a deferred from a done to fail ), evaluate your ajax resposne in a deferred .pipe and return another deferred out of that rejecting or resolving it and passing the arguments along...pretty sweet to check for valid data in ur ajax.
[10:53:10] <Mindore> added .js to body and then ill put classes on my tags to replace so the text will be there if someone without js want to see my page :P
[10:53:21] <hlveheart> ;\
[10:54:20] <Mindore> is there any other things to think about?
[10:54:42] <djQuery> Mindore: typicaly I have a class called noJs and the first thing I do is remove that
[10:54:58] <Mindore> okok
[10:55:31] <Mindore> short selectors, cache selectors, add classes instead of .css(). something more? :)
[10:56:02] <Mindore> djQuery: thanks for the link, most useful :)
[10:56:19] <systemfault> When I say add classes, it doesn't mean necessarily on the elements itself
[10:56:29] <systemfault> Could be on the body or a parent element
[10:56:38] <Mindore> sure
[10:56:52] <Mindore> just enough to hit my objects :)
[10:57:20] <djQuery> Mindore: disregard that link half of the suggestion in it have been rulled invalid
[10:57:31] <systemfault> Yeah... 1 4 and 8
[10:57:39] <djQuery> 9
[10:57:46] <systemfault> Yeah
[10:57:54] <ryanneufeld> considering that article was written about 2 years ago
[10:57:57] <ryanneufeld> it's fairly outdated
[10:58:00] <NightMiles> hlveheart: http://jsfiddle.net/jDsty/1/
[10:58:46] <NightMiles> hlveheart: Your if statement being outside of click's callback function meant it never got run after the page was loaded the first time. Take a look at what I did instead.
[10:59:12] <hlveheart> Can anyone explain why this fails? http://jsfiddle.net/NjQQC/ Basically, I'm trying to have when you click one of the hrefs, add a class and remove the other
[10:59:23] <hlveheart> but it never removes the class :(
[10:59:51] <NightMiles> hlveheart: Look at the link I just gave you. The red background color is just there to show when the button has/does not have the active class.
[11:00:09] <hlveheart> ah didn't see your link lol
[11:00:10] <hlveheart> one sec.
[11:02:31] <NightMiles> hlveheart: The problem with your code was that the if statement was outside the function you passed to a.button's click event
[11:04:00] <Mindore> is there any nice way to analyse the loading time of my script?
[11:04:13] <Mindore> so i can try and find faster solutions?
[11:04:22] <moo-_-> Mindore: yes
[11:04:29] <moo-_-> google chrome has extensive profiling tools
[11:04:31] <djQuery> hlveheart:  .click(function(e){ $(this).toggleClass('active').siblings('.active').removeClass('active'); e.preventDefault(); })
[11:04:59] <NightMiles> djQuery: Ooh, much more elegant.
[11:05:08] <Matthieu_> Hi, Can anybody kindly have a look a this page failing to display any jqgrid ? : http://museboostinglabs.no-ip.org:8888/bluebox/index.php/simpleroute/index (creds : test@test.com | test123)
[11:05:09] <djQuery> Mindore: and if you are looking at generic functions there is jsperf
[11:05:27] <Mindore> djQuery: okey, ill look it up
[11:05:29] <systemfault> Mindore: Use the chrome dev tools, it has a profiler
[11:05:31] <djQuery> Mindore: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/10-ways-to-instantly-increase-your-jquery-performance/
[11:06:18] <systemfault> Even 7 is a bit bad..
[11:06:22] <systemfault> Not that much though
[11:06:51] <djQuery> Mindore: there is also console.timer
[11:06:54] <systemfault> There's nothing wrong with appending to an element as long as it's not in the main DOM tree
[11:07:08] <systemfault> (In a tight loop I mean)
[11:07:25] <djQuery> Mindore: damn clip board this is the link to jsperf http://jsperf.com/jquery-live-vs-jquery-delegate/15
[11:07:33] <Mindore> djQuery: okok :)
[11:07:44] <braddunbar> So...why does jQuery mobile wait until after all document ready callbacks are complete to init?
[11:08:18] <systemfault> djQuery: Thanks for that benchmark, I was actually curious
[11:08:43] <djQuery> systemfault: I didnt write it.
[11:09:19] <systemfault> djQuery: It shows.. that benchmark is so wrong.
[11:09:22] <djQuery> searching google for jsperf   method1 vs method2 usualy gives you good results
[11:09:49] <Mindore> okok :)
[11:10:24] <systemfault> djQuery: The speed of adding delegate/live is meaningless :(
[11:10:39] <systemfault> djQuery: That's not something you would do in a loop...
[11:10:44] <systemfault> That's a "one-time" thing
[11:11:17] <djQuery> systemfault: I didnt write it? I think they are trying to simulate haveing multiple .delgates?
[11:11:25] <Ignition-IRC> i've cloned the git repo, built and took the min css and js of 1.9m5. But it doesn't style tables for me like the 1.9m5 demo pages do...have I missed something?
[11:11:34] <systemfault> It doesn't simulate anything..
[11:11:54] <systemfault> It justs shows that calling delegate is faster than calling .live
[11:12:06] <systemfault> Which... simply.. doesn't make any sense.
[11:12:57] <Vorspire> yay maybe temp01 is gonna upgrade bot-t to latest jq ver lol
[11:13:11] <systemfault> Vorspire: What's the version now?
[11:13:15] <Vorspire> 1.4.2
[11:13:17] <multipass> hi, how would I change the "ABC" and "XYZ" to "(" and ")" basically add parentisis as part of regex  ----    var sub = str.replace(/^.*ABC(.*)XYZ.*$/m, '$1');
[11:13:19] <systemfault> ?eval jQuery.version
[11:13:24] <systemfault> Ah :/
[11:13:32] <Vorspire> bot-t just quit with temp01, must be a reboot
[11:14:22] <djQuery> whats up with bot-t.com ?
[11:14:40] <Vorspire> looks like the domain ran out
[11:14:45] <Vorspire> the registration
[11:14:55] <Ignition-IRC> i've cloned the git repo, built and took the min css and js of 1.9m5. But it doesn't style tables for me like the 1.9m5 demo pages do...have I missed something?
[11:14:55] <Vorspire> or the server that hosts it is down
[11:15:45] <Vorspire> ?eval jQuery.version
[11:15:46] <bot-t> Vorspire: undefined
[11:16:25] <snover> it’s on .fn.
[11:16:29] <Ignition-IRC> the demo runs from the non min version but they should have same code
[11:16:39] <Ignition-IRC> demo pages was popup|popup-menu-table
[11:16:48] <djQuery> ?eval jQuery.fn.version
[11:16:49] <bot-t> djQuery: undefined
[11:16:54] <Vorspire> ;)
[11:17:00] <Vorspire> its a function call afaik
[11:17:14] <djQuery> ?aval jQuery.fn.jquery
[11:17:16] <bot-t> djQuery, jquery.dualListBox-1.3.min.js - prwf - proyectoprueba - Google ... - http://code.google.com/p/prwf/source/browse/trunk/Fuentes/WorkflowProyectos/deploy/workflowproyectos.war/js/jquery.dualListbox-1.3/jquery.dualListBox-1.3.min.js?spec=svn7&r=7

[11:17:24] <Vorspire> heh
[11:17:27] <djQuery> great mispell eval
[11:18:38] <Ignition-IRC> has anyone played with 1.9?
[11:19:15] <d4rklit3> could there be a reason why no jquery on my page will initialize?
[11:19:27] <d4rklit3> until i refresh the page like 10-20-30 ties
[11:19:27] <d4rklit3> times
[11:19:45] <Ignition-IRC> d4rklit3: can you provide code in a pastebin?
[11:20:05] <d4rklit3> too much code
[11:20:11] <d4rklit3> to paste
[11:20:39] <d4rklit3> i put everyting in $(document).ready( func )
[11:20:52] <d4rklit3> not everything
[11:20:56] <d4rklit3> just the initializing functions
[11:21:50] <Ignition-IRC> that's standard, but if your code base is very large you may have missed something
[11:22:13] <Ignition-IRC> a qwerk in your code logic
[11:22:21] <Ignition-IRC> async race condition?
[11:22:58] <Ignition-IRC> without looking at your code I can't really tell
[11:23:45] <Ignition-IRC> can you shrink it down to a problem case which exibits the same issue
[11:24:01] <phyntek> Hello people, does anyone can help me with a livequery issue?
[11:25:22] <Ignition-IRC> phyntek: whats the issue?
[11:25:42] <djQuery> Ignition-IRC: hve you tried just using the git hub links on the jqueryui page instead of hosting them urself? http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css
[11:26:18] <phyntek> Hi Ignition, i'm making a test with a little easy code using livequery, but IE give me error
[11:27:01] <phyntek> http://jsfiddle.net/CDbzb/
[11:27:01] <Ignition-IRC> djQuery: ah ok didn't realise they were 1.9pre
[11:27:12] <Ignition-IRC> djQuery: thanks i'll give that a go
[11:27:19] <phyntek> that's the code im using
[11:28:10] <phyntek> but IE returns this: Object doesn't support this property or method
[11:28:17] * djQuery livequery shudders
[11:28:22] <phyntek> and it work on Safari and Firefox
[11:28:35] <Ignition-IRC> phyntek: im on linux so I don't have IE but I'll look at your code to see what it could be
[11:28:43] <Ignition-IRC> did you have a line number?
[11:28:51] <phyntek> line 10
[11:28:53] <Ignition-IRC> oh wait
[11:29:06] <phyntek> the link im using is: http://hsinteractivo.com/duplicate.ie.php
[11:29:08] <phyntek> ups
[11:29:15] <drd> any thoughts on a way to know when all ajax *handlers* have completed running? or suggestions on how to wrap all ajax handlers as they're bound?
[11:29:19] <phyntek> http://hsinteractivo.com/duplicate/ie.php
[11:29:21] <d4rklit3> Ignition-IRC not sure
[11:29:30] <d4rklit3> it happens before anything
[11:29:34] <d4rklit3> like jquery doesn't initialize at all
[11:29:37] <d4rklit3> none of teh code works
[11:29:47] <d4rklit3> its before any ajax can even happen
[11:30:01] <theotherguy_> anyidea on this? http://d.pr/fvIG
[11:30:25] <Vorspire> d4rklit3 are you using a debugger?
[11:30:55] <erichynds> drd: bind to .ajaxStop()
[11:31:24] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC is really simple
[11:31:41] <phyntek> but i don't know why freaking IE gives me error
[11:31:42] <phyntek> hehe
[11:31:46] <drd> erichynds: .ajaxStop() fires after all the handlers have completed? or just after the request has completed?
[11:31:48] <Vorspire> because it's IE?
[11:31:58] <phyntek> hahaha
[11:32:00] <phyntek> could be
[11:32:06] <erichynds> drd: after all have completed
[11:32:24] <erichynds> drd: ajaxComplete() will fire after a request has completed
[11:32:47] <drd> ahh, excellent. so they only case i would be concerned is if the handler did something async
[11:32:48] <Vorspire> *successful or not
[11:33:00] <Ignition-IRC> phyntek: wrap it up in a $(document).ready()
[11:33:08] <drd> which is kind of out of my ability to deal with anyway
[11:33:38] <phyntek> let me try it
[11:34:23] <drd> erichynds: Vorspire: thanks for clarification!
[11:35:01] <whitebook> erichynds: here?
[11:37:08] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: still have the same error
[11:37:11] <phyntek> :/
[11:37:11] <phyntek> hehe
[11:37:26] <phyntek> now is in line 10
[11:37:29] <phyntek> sorry, 11
[11:37:43] <erichynds> whitebook: hi
[11:37:58] <whitebook> hey eric
[11:38:10] <Ignition-IRC> phyntek: so $('a') line?
[11:38:22] <phyntek> 11
[11:39:09] <phyntek> does anyone know a good irc client for mac?
[11:40:26] <Ignition-IRC> phyntek: you good with command line then use irssi
[11:41:31] <systemfault> phyntek: colloquy with a good theme, not the default is the best I've found
[11:42:31] <Ignition-IRC> phyntek: erm why do you have both livequery and livequery min?
[11:42:31] <systemfault> irssi is pointless without a server..
[11:43:42] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: good question
[11:43:55] <phyntek> hehe
[11:44:02] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: should use just one?
[11:44:09] <Ignition-IRC> yep
[11:44:38] <Ignition-IRC> hoping that is it otherwise I need to boot my windows box (its a bit dusty)
[11:45:25] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: that's not the problem
[11:45:25] <phyntek> hehe
[11:45:27] <phyntek> :S
[11:45:43] <phyntek> IE just returns this: Object doesn't support this property or method
[11:45:53] <Ignition-IRC> move the script to after the body?
[11:46:40] <dtach> my code works 100% in all browsers but IE, googling for help is too generic (keyword wise) how am i suppose to fix my code to work with the worse browser ever? One error is about my array, trailersQ[playIndex].url <- it stops on that 'null or not an object'
[11:46:48] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: the same
[11:47:06] <Ignition-IRC> remove white space between $('a') and .livequery?
[11:47:38] <Ignition-IRC> i'm just guessing now, hoping I hit an answer before I need to boot windows
[11:47:38] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: same
[11:47:39] <phyntek> hehe
[11:48:07] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: i know, i guest a lot before i decide to enter here
[11:48:07] <Ignition-IRC> after </body>
[11:48:07] <phyntek> hehe
[11:48:46] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: still the same
[11:48:48] <phyntek> hehe
[11:48:51] <mwcarroll> what would cause $('.classname').change(function(){... not to work on a select element?
[11:49:01] <Ignition-IRC> ok windows box time
[11:49:07] <phyntek> hahaha
[11:49:07] <phyntek> nice
[11:50:07] <systemfault> mwcarroll: Perhaps the selector returns nothing
[11:50:57] <mwcarroll> systemfault: it should...
[11:51:11] <systemfault> mwcarroll: Difficult to tell you without seeing anything :/
[11:51:39] <mwcarroll> can I do $('.classname select').change ?
[11:52:25] <gratnam11> can some one tell me how do send variable to php?

[11:58:52] <Ignition-IRC> phyntek: you still here
[12:00:00] <ampzamp> I figured colorbox and have been using it due to update/simplicity/minimalism.  then saw yoxview.  I can't tell due to not being advanced enough to know.

[12:02:53] <mwcarroll> systemfault: I'm trying to get the form ID
[12:03:10] <mwcarroll> there will be multiple forms just like this with dynamic IDs on the same page
[12:03:34] <systemfault> mwcarroll: That's not even a valid selector :(
[12:03:47] <systemfault> Close though
[12:03:49] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: nice
[12:03:52] <mwcarroll> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[12:03:59] <phyntek> what exactly you did?
[12:04:21] <systemfault> mwcarroll: compare where is the first [ in your code and in the example on the website
[12:04:24] <mwcarroll> oi
[12:04:24] <ModFather> does anyone knows any jquery v1.5.2 sumbit form bug?
[12:04:40] <Ignition-IRC> jquery load before livequery....dependency

[12:05:06] <Assimilater> hey, i'm looking at the jquery documentation on ajax and it's the most shrimp on examples of any of jquery documentation i've seen :(, anyways what's the simplest form of calling a php script with post data?
[12:05:11] <mwcarroll> systemfault: fixed: $('select[name="CRFEditOverrideReason"]').change(function () {
[12:05:13] <phyntek> nice
[12:05:29] <phyntek> Ignition-IRC: so you move the livequery after the dom loads
[12:05:47] <systemfault> mwcarroll: Indeed ;)
[12:05:55] <mwcarroll> still doesn't work though
[12:06:02] <Ignition-IRC> no after jquery fetch
[12:06:05] <t4nkd> Hey jquery, if I want to create a conditional for an element .contentRow with a child #calendar -- would it be #('.contentRow:contains('#calendar')') ??
[12:06:07] <mwcarroll> I get no alert box when I change the value
[12:06:15] <systemfault> mwcarroll: Write a small testcase on a live pastebin like: jsfiddle.net
[12:06:20] <t4nkd> s/#(/$(
[12:06:48] <systemfault> t4nkd: You would get escaping problems with that.
[12:07:00] <phyntek> understand
[12:07:07] <phyntek> thanks Ignition-IRC
[12:07:25] <t4nkd> What would be the right way to go about it; ``if ($('something')) {function}``
[12:07:41] <t4nkd> I'm missing that "something" should be, an element .contentRow with child #calendar
[12:07:56] <Ignition-IRC> phyntek: no worries its been a while since I've not spotted solution quickly
[12:08:15] <phyntek> hehe
[12:08:20] <phyntek> really appreciate your help
[12:08:54] <Ignition-IRC> ok i'm off to do some of my own development, cya
[12:10:25] <ModFather> when your form using jquery 1.5.2 doesnt send the form variables sometimes to the SQL server, is caused by a jquery version bug?
[12:10:39] <ModFather> does anyone know if 1.5.2 jquery version has a known submit bug?
[12:12:15] <mwcarroll> systemfault: still can't get it to work
[12:12:46] <systemfault> mwcarroll: Write a testcase, on jsfiddle.net then we could debug it
[12:13:22] <mwcarroll> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/XXmRb/3/

[12:15:25] <daninma> can anyone tell me hwo to read the text in a textarea?  the following doesnt work in IE7 but works in firefox... $("#change_desc_row textarea").val()
[12:17:09] <daninma> any thoughts? ic ant find it listed as a bug
[12:18:21] <t4nkd> Can anyone help me with the syntax to return true if a element contains a child with an ID of calendar?
[12:18:46] <t4nkd> I tried $('.foo').children() == 'div#calendar' but, no luck
[12:19:06] <moo-_-> t4nkd: you cannot do string comparison
[12:19:21] <moo-_-> it's jquery collection object
[12:19:22] <moo-_-> not a strong
[12:19:24] <moo-_-> string
[12:19:40] <t4nkd> true, but I can't do string comparison or I can't use string comparison on a collection object?
[12:19:58] <moo-_-> the latter
[12:20:04] <moo-_-> if you find to find out the elements
[12:20:05] <mwcarroll> systemfault: now... why doesn't this work: $('#' + $(this).parent().parent().attr('id'); ' .CRFEditOverrideReasonText').removeAttr('disabled');
[12:20:06] <moo-_-> you can do
[12:20:20] <t4nkd> moo-_-: ty :)
[12:20:26] <moo-_-> $colection.foreach(function() { console.log(this); });
[12:20:27] <systemfault> mwcarroll: Update your testcase :'(
[12:20:34] <moo-_-> and it will print out what it has eaten
[12:20:39] <moo-_-> sorry
[12:20:45] <moo-_-> $colection.each(function() { console.log(this); });
[12:21:06] <t4nkd> Ah I see -- is there a better way to query my parent element for comparison?
[12:21:08] * moo-_- needs to go to remove his dry contact lenses as he cannot see characters anymore and must IRC by ear
[12:21:12] <t4nkd> Or is this probably the best way
[12:21:16] <moo-_-> t4nkd: usually just
[12:21:25] <mwcarroll> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/XXmRb/8/
[12:21:32] <moo-_-> $(".foo").find("#childid")
[12:21:34] <moo-_-> or
[12:21:38] <moo-_-> parents()
[12:21:45] <t4nkd> Oh I see, that would return true then
[12:21:48] <t4nkd> because it can .find
[12:21:50] <moo-_-> t4nkd: read Traversing chapter in jQuery docs
[12:22:55] <daninma> anyone happen to know why $("#tabelrowid textarea").val() will not read textarea text in internet explorer?(6/7)
[12:23:16] <polyrhythmic> mwcarroll: that js has syntax errors, I suggest you JSHint, at the least
[12:23:17] <daninma> i also tried .text and .html
[12:23:31] <newbjquery> is it possible to use $.get to load a specific portion of a page like .load does ?
[12:24:54] <t4nkd> So, here's a thing -- I have a function for a plugin, $('#foo').plugIn() and it contains all kinds of awesomness for callsbacks and such -- how can I reinstantialize this through a conditional?
[12:25:14] <Assimilater> hey, i'm looking at the jquery documentation on ajax and it's the most shrimp on examples of any of jquery documentation i've seen :(, anyways what's the simplest form of calling a php script with post data?
[12:25:18] <t4nkd> Like, can I just make that whole select+function a var?
[12:25:35] <t4nkd> Or, how does that work, per ce
[12:25:42] <systemfault> mwcarroll: Sorry, was away, checking it.. but like polyrhythmic said, it has syntax errors
[12:27:40] <newbjquery> Assimilater: Are you attempting an ajax post ?
[12:28:12] <rickjr85> Is there a way, when using the draggable JQuery UI function, to make it so it can only be dragged within the confines of it's parent element?
[12:28:28] <Assimilater> newbjquery: i'm simple minded....i just want to access a php script while sending post data
[12:28:51] <Assimilater> wc/while/by
[12:29:48] <McChen> hi guys
[12:30:06] <gasull> I want to make a request to /chat/is-user-banned/ every two minutes.  It returns a JSON.  Any examples that do something similar?
[12:30:33] <newbjquery> @Assimilater you can do something like $("#objectID").load("test.php", { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"] }  (that's from the docs)
[12:31:16] <Assimilater> i'm familiar with load, but i've never known it to be able to use post data....
[12:31:16] <systemfault> mwcarroll: http://jsfiddle.net/XXmRb/13/
[12:31:24] <Assimilater> the second paramater is a function, is it not?
[12:31:27] <Assimilater> callback?
[12:31:28] <newbjquery> That would load a <div id="#objectID"> with the results of passing choices Jon, Susan via post to test.php
[12:33:04] <McChen> i am wondering how do you guys usually deal with accessibility issue when it comes to using jquery
[12:33:32] <McChen> as "display: none" is often not accessibility friendly
[12:33:34] <newbjquery> It depends on how heavily I'm relying on jquery.
[12:34:50] <__name__> When there's a click event there are mousedown and mouseup events fired as well?
[12:34:53] <McChen> for instance, when you just do a simple collapsible navigation w/ jquery, you apply "display: none" to the nested navigation, so that it gets hidden first
[12:36:04] <McChen> some ppl suggested using "visibility:hidden" instead of display:none, but that still leaves the block visible, only its content is hidden
[12:36:19] <systemfault> What?
[12:36:27] <systemfault> Ahh right.
[12:37:13] <systemfault> But heh.. the fact that dropdown menus are bad for accessibility isn't new afaik
[12:37:50] <McChen> systemfault: any advice on how to go around it?
[12:38:43] <systemfault> Well.. IMHO, website where accessibility is important shouldn't have that kind of menus..
[12:39:44] <newbjquery> is it possible to use $.get to load a specific portion of a page like .load does ?
[12:40:10] <systemfault> Why don't you use .load then? :/
[12:40:57] <djQuery> ?.load
[12:40:58] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:41:29] <djQuery> Assimilater: .load( [eventData,] handler(eventObject) )
[12:42:10] <Assimilater> djQuery: i'm familiar with load, it doesn't do what i want, i found, thanks to newbjquery, $.post()
[12:42:35] <Assimilater> oh wait, that wasn't directed at me?
[12:42:52] <Assimilater> what was? /me saw the orange square indicating somone addressed me in this channel :S
[12:43:44] <djQuery> McChen: there are some aria attributes you could apply to it as well. other wise    .myhidden { left: -9999999999999; }  that way it is still available for the screen reader to read
[12:44:54] <djQuery> McChen: take a look at the source of ui.tabs and see what it does.
[12:45:01] <newbjquery> @systemfault I'm just attempting to learn.
[12:45:13] <systemfault> newbjquery: Then yes, sure
[12:45:38] <systemfault> newbjquery: load is just one the multiple facades on .ajax
[12:45:45] <newbjquery> @systemfault I'd just like to better understand the way it functions... I know they all boil down to .ajax
[12:46:17] <newbjquery> @systemfault I just for my piece of mind would like to know how to write it at each level...
[12:46:27] <systemfault> Ahhhh ok
[12:46:57] <newbjquery> @systemfault so when I'm attempting to explain to someone who doesn't program, but management decides NEEDS to maintain MY code their heads don't explode.
[12:47:23] <newbjquery> Did I mention my company uses overseas support ....
[12:47:26] <newbjquery> sigh.
[12:47:30] <systemfault> Ah :#
[12:47:33] <systemfault> Wonderful
[12:47:36] <t4nkd> Can you do conditionals in a... thing... Like, $('foo').appendTo('bar').doFuction() unless somecondition
[12:47:48] <t4nkd> But it'll always appendTo?
[12:48:02] <t4nkd> Or do I put the conditional in the function...
[12:48:14] <newbjquery> So I'm just really attempting to explain it, rather than just using it... I can just use it, but I want to "Get / grok" it
[12:48:30] <newbjquery> So ... that said...
[12:49:35] <systemfault> Ah ok, so..
[12:49:42] <newbjquery> I just need a bit of sample code using each level ... just to understand it.
[12:49:52] <systemfault> What? :/
[12:49:56] <McChen> djQuery: thanks :)
[12:50:30] <newbjquery> an example of performing .load event using .get or .ajax
[12:50:47] <systemfault> newbjquery: Easy..
[12:51:21] <newbjquery> nod, I can use .load just fine... but I'd like to just understand it... ya dig ?
[12:51:48] <moo-_-> can I use query parameters with jQuery Mobile hashbang navigation
[12:51:59] <moo-_-> e.g. href="#mypage?param=foobar"
[12:52:02] <systemfault> newbjquery: You get the page's content with .get then you take out the <script> tags with some regex, you add the resulting text in a dynamically created div then you select the content node... then append the content to the final node.
[12:54:11] <newbjquery> Hmmm as in a hidden div ?
[12:54:36] <newbjquery> couldn't I just perform the work on (response) ?
[12:55:03] <systemfault> newbjquery: You must add the content of the response in a div or else you won't be able to select anything
[12:55:28] <systemfault> newbjquery: basically: $('<div />').html(response.ripthescripttags);
[12:55:57] <systemfault> Hmm, perhaps .append would be better in that case.
[12:55:59] <systemfault> So..
[12:56:31] <systemfault> newbjquery: basically: var content = $('<div />').append(response.ripthescripttags).find('theselectorofthenodeweneed');
[12:57:02] <t4nkd> Is there something obviously wrong with the true function for my statement? Every div.contentRow seems to contain #calendar(even though the DOM says different): https://gist.github.com/1072681
[12:57:07] <systemfault> Then destination.html(content);
[12:57:18] <phlp> newbjquery: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L175
[12:57:31] <daninma> ok I'm going to pull my hair out. anyone have any suggestions as hwo to target the text in a textarea? .val() works in Firefox but not in IE, seems like IE ignores the textarea no matter hwo specific I get with selectors
[12:58:09] <systemfault> daninma: Do you have a link or something we can access?
[12:58:33] <djQuery> daninma: see ?demo
[12:58:33] <bot-t> daninma, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:59:17] <daninma> i assumed it was a known issue so i didnt create an entire mock up.
[12:59:39] <daninma> even using the direct id it wont work in ie. very weird
[13:00:53] <phlp> t4nkd: you probably want !$('div.contentRow').has('#calendar').is('.fc')
[13:01:26] <t4nkd> phlp: cool thanks man I'll try it
[13:01:56] <Cork[home]> phlp: why not just select on the id directly?
[13:02:15] <Cork[home]> !$('div.contentRow#calendar').is('.fc')
[13:04:06] <phlp> .has returns the parent
[13:05:38] <phlp> !$('#calendar').parents('div.contentRow').is('.fc')
[13:05:59] <Lomex> Can anyone tell me how to REMOVE an HTML Element?
[13:06:19] <Anitox> .remove()
[13:06:24] <t4nkd> oh snap
[13:06:33] <Lomex> Sorry I should have just googled
[13:06:35] <Lomex> But thanks ;)
[13:06:37] <Anitox> :D
[13:06:39] <newbjquery> systemfault / phlp sweet.
[13:06:48] <newbjquery> I get it.
[13:07:05] <systemfault> :D
[13:08:03] <t4nkd> I can clearly see the contentRow element is empty but this still logs 'it does': if ($('#calendar').parents('div.contentRow')) {console.log('it does')};
[13:08:21] <t4nkd> Am I totally off target in my conditional?
[13:08:58] <t4nkd> It seems like, if it can even execute my statement it returns true
[13:09:03] <t4nkd> Even if it doesn't find a match
[13:09:28] <diamonds> t4nkd: can you make a jsfiddle?
[13:09:36] <diamonds> `fiddle
[13:09:38] <diamonds> `test
[13:09:39] <t4nkd> I can link to a showoff of the site in progress
[13:09:41] <diamonds> :(
[13:09:42] <t4nkd> for 5m :0
[13:09:43] <diamonds> sure
[13:09:49] <t4nkd> cool deal
[13:09:53] <phlp> t4nkd: if ($('#calendar').parents('div.contentRow').length)
[13:10:03] <rewt> because selectors return something, even if no matches are found
[13:10:26] <t4nkd> rewt: that took me about 30 minutes to figure out :(
[13:11:03] <rewt> it's like that so when you chain them, and there's no match in the middle, it doesn't bomb out on you with errors
[13:14:59] <t4nkd> Okie, ya'll can maybe help me identify an IF statement for this beast -- I just need to trigger a function; https://sdd7.showoff.io/news-community
[13:15:32] <t4nkd> $('#calendar').parents('div.contentRow').length > 1 doesn't seem to do it for me
[13:16:08] <babonk> How can I click a certain option in a select using jQuery?
[13:16:10] <keiron> hi room
[13:16:27] <babonk> basically emulate a user having selected a specific option
[13:17:16] <keiron> how can i cancel a previous event in its tracks if a new one starts?
[13:17:34] <keiron> e.g. on this element: $('#sidebar .friends input').live('keyup', function() {...});
[13:17:54] <Assimilater> here's a question: can i use jquery to grab a screenshot of a div and send the resulting image file to a server script via post?
[13:21:38] <Assimilater> anyone?
[13:22:34] <diamonds> I don't know of any javascript that can get a "screenshot" of an element
[13:22:50] <rewt> wouldn't that be a security issue?
[13:22:57] <diamonds> I was thinking the same thing...
[13:23:00] <Assimilater> how so?
[13:23:10] <phlp> t4nkd: #calendar is not inside .contentRow ?
[13:23:20] <t4nkd> I figured out how to use .length
[13:23:22] <t4nkd> It was though
[13:23:34] <keiron> Assimilater: what's in the content of the div?
[13:23:41] <t4nkd> Now I have a new problem but, I got the conditional working at least
[13:23:55] <keiron> is there a way to cancel an event mid-run?
[13:23:56] <Assimilater> a few styled tables, a couple disables sliders and a few styles header elements
[13:23:58] <__name__> Can I somehow get the data after # in the url with jquery?
[13:24:14] <__name__> http://foo.bar/baz.html#THAT
[13:24:25] <Cork[home]> __name__: no need to use jquery
[13:24:31] <Cork[home]> window.location.hash
[13:24:39] <__name__> Cork[home]: Oh, thank you!
[13:24:40] <equivoc> __name__: location.hash
[13:24:47] <equivoc> oups :)
[13:24:52] <Cork[home]> :P
[13:26:46] <Assimilater> keiron: (the div in questino is #viewer) http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/Ugt7P/2/
[13:28:11] <keiron> Assimilater: prob not very helpful but you could use ajax to post the data to your server and replicate the contents of the div using dompdf and email a pdf instead
[13:28:44] <Assimilater> well right now i have it setup to send the html to the server
[13:28:57] <t4nkd> Is there a way, or could someone help me to learn, how I can execute a function /AFTER/ this one?(Like, normally a callback); https://gist.github.com/db2f7f63eb48e9cefce1
[13:29:00] <Assimilater> i tried emailing that and i learned the challenges of sending styled html to a web client
[13:29:04] <Assimilater> :P
[13:29:23] <Assimilater> essentially the html you see is what php generates, it grabs the numbers
[13:29:28] <keiron> is it possible to check if there is an active event happening on an element?
[13:29:29] <Assimilater> i'm just using jquery ui to position the sliders
[13:31:30] <Enginoob> How do you get the tag name of a parent element?
[13:32:01] <phlp> keiron: .is(':animated')
[13:32:01] <Enginoob> ie, you have <li><a>, you do a getElementByTagName('a'), how do you confirm from that array that it is a child of li?
[13:33:05] <Anitox> Enginoob: this.nodeName
[13:33:19] <whateverb> Is it possible to have diagonal line between two images and that line is draggable to view the image you want? OR is that impossible with cross-browser support?
[13:33:32] <Enginoob> Anitox: What will that return?
[13:33:35] <Anitox> tag
[13:33:48] <keiron> ph1p: thanks
[13:33:56] <Enginoob> Anitox: Thank you :)
[13:35:28] <r3v3rb> is there a way using the jquery validate plugin to get the errors into the input themselves?
[13:36:04] <r3v3rb> rather than a new label element
[13:39:20] <gasull> how do I read the data returned by getJSON?
[13:39:24] <Rushing> there are options for handling the error, don't remember what they are off the top of my head
[13:39:52] <Anitox> gasull, there's an example on the page for .getJSON
[13:39:52] <Rushing> gasull, the same way you would a javascript object
[13:40:07] <Rushing> r3v3rb, why would you want the errors IN the input...that's wierd to me
[13:41:17] <gasull> Rushing: I get this returned from getJSON, according to Firebug: XMLHttpRequest { responseText="{"is_user_banned": false}", mozResponseArrayBuffer=ArrayBuffer, more...}
[13:41:44] <gasull> Rushing: I want to read the false in there.
[13:42:07] <gasull> I haven't programmed much in jQuery/JS
[13:43:07] <tbranyen> gasull: $.getJSON('<url>', function( data ) { console.log( data.is_user_banned ); });
[13:43:08] <Rushing> so the XMLHttpRequest is the parameter passed to the callbac, right
[13:48:23] <Lomex> Can anyone explain quickly to me what exactly json is good for
[13:49:00] <phlp> look up soap
[13:49:15] <t4nkd> Is there someone who can take a look at this selector attempt and tell me where I went wrong? I need #calendar but not #calendar.fc -- https://gist.github.com/1072779
[13:49:17] <bobbobbins> i like json as an easy way to access arrays
[13:49:20] <Anitox> it's easy access to data in a structured format
[13:49:30] <bobbobbins> and other stuff
[13:50:04] <gasull> tbranyen: thanks
[13:50:27] <Rushing> Lomex, it's also pretty lightweight
[13:50:37] <Lomex> :D
[13:50:41] <Lomex> thats great!
[13:50:47] <Lomex> But im a heavy weight
[13:51:00] <Rushing> i prefer xml over just about every data format, so i use json very little
[13:51:08] <tbranyen> gasull: np
[13:52:21] <t4nkd> What would be my selector syntax for div#calendar but NOT div#calendar.fc
[13:53:15] <Rushing> $("div#calendar").not(".fc")
[13:53:18] <SoulRaven> hy
[13:53:33] <Rushing> or $("div#calendar:not(.fc)")
[13:53:39] <Rushing> ?not @ t4nkd
[13:53:39] <bot-t> t4nkd, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[13:53:39] <SoulRaven> please help me, i can't use datepicker multiple time on the same page
[13:54:12] <Anitox> you need to use unique IDs
[13:54:14] <t4nkd> Hrm, I'm trying :not and it doesn't seem be working out
[13:54:30] <level09> is :contains("something") case insensitive
[13:54:39] <Rushing> then you are doing it wrong :P
[13:54:52] <t4nkd> Naw, I know why, it's because I have more than one ID'd element
[13:55:03] <t4nkd> I .clone()'d it
[13:55:06] <t4nkd> And totally forgot
[13:55:17] <Rushing> ah, tisk tisk
[13:55:23] <t4nkd> unlucky right :(
[13:55:44] <SoulRaven> i have set the datepicker to use element on class, but still i can't set on multiple fields
[13:57:46] <Rushing> SoulRaven, hard to say without seeing the code
[13:59:32] <SoulRaven> Rushing: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1740530772
[13:59:36] <SoulRaven> this is the html code
[14:00:42] <Rushing> and you tried $(".datepicker").datepicker() ?
[14:00:44] <SoulRaven> Rushing: and this is the js: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/240344298
[14:01:40] <Rushing> i don't understand the bit about the dialog in here
[14:02:07] <SoulRaven> is to initialise the datepicker on a ui dialog
[14:02:35] <Rushing> do you have an example of this integration or something? doesn't make sense to me
[14:02:54] <Rushing> take all of it out of that dialog bind and try it
[14:03:46] <Rushing> or is the form in a ui dialog?
[14:04:06] <SoulRaven> yes, the form is in a ui dialog
[14:08:47] <PastorBones> How would I add a random string to the end of a image url to force the browser not to use cached copy?
[14:08:48] <SoulRaven> Rushing: http://jsfiddle.net/VTUS7/
[14:09:59] <Rushing> so they all work there
[14:10:09] <Rushing> i'm working on a jsfiddle with the dialog...
[14:10:56] <SoulRaven> yes, but i can't set the date for each field, any field that i select, the date is updated on the first
[14:12:02] <Rushing> oh, cause you need unique id's for your inputs
[14:12:29] <Rushing> so instead of id="startwarranty", it should be something like id="row1_startwarranty"
[14:12:35] <Rushing> row2_startwarranty, etc
[14:12:58] <SoulRaven> ok, but i initilise datepicker with class, not id
[14:13:28] <Rushing> ok, and that's probably why the datepicker shows up, but when it sets its value, it might use an ID
[14:14:03] <Rushing> plus, it's just incorrect HTML to have ID's that aren't unique...you notice that the labels for each row focus on the first row too?
[14:16:02] <Rushing> i'd have to dig into the datepicker code to know how it sets it's value, and i would think that it just uses the "element" property, but there's something else going on here. i understand it seems wierd, since you used the class to create the datepicker originally, but at some point it's using the field ID, so just make the IDs unique (as they should be) and you're good to go
[14:16:56] <SoulRaven> ok, i have do that and is working, but if i don't have ID, how is set the date on fields?
[14:17:26] <Rushing> sorry i don't understand your question
[14:19:17] <SoulRaven> if the ID is missing, how the date is set on the field?
[14:19:40] <Rushing> you should not remove the IDs, you should jus tmake them unique
[14:20:28] <Rushing> anyhow, as i said i don't know the datepicker code, but if the element has an ID, it uses it at some point. if it doesn't have an ID, i guess it just uses the element property of the widget
[14:20:44] <Rushing> which is what it should do anyways, but i don't know the code
[14:21:15] <SoulRaven> Rushing: thx, i have made the code to generate uniq ID for each field, and is working know
[14:21:31] <Rushing> good :)
[14:23:58] <devinrolsen> afternoon all.
[14:24:24] <Rushing> hiya
[14:29:46] <totallyvinny> trying to recreate the footer/scroll effect here: http://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire/
[14:29:52] <totallyvinny> any ideas on how to achieve this?
[14:31:04] <phlp> css position:fixed
[14:31:49] <totallyvinny> i tried that and once the footer reaches the bottome the effect jumps
[14:36:56] <Rushing> totallyvinny, i have to go, but you might try making an invisible div with the same height as the footer, and toggle that when you toggle the fixed/unfixed position
[14:37:40] <Rushing> the problem might be related to the page height increasing as you suddenly unfix the footer
[14:37:58] <totallyvinny> ah Rushing thanks
[14:38:03] <totallyvinny> ill try that out
[14:38:08] <Rushing> np, good luck
[14:42:38] <mikeycgto> why do people hate on jquery?
[14:47:10] <trumpetmic> can anyone recommend a favorite jQuery pagination plugin?
[14:48:03] <digitok-> $('#test').fadeOut(1000).text('sup').fadeIn(1000);
[14:48:24] <digitok-> any idea why this fades out and in AFTER the text is changed to 'sup', rather than fading out the original text, then fading in the new text?
[14:48:58] <digitok-> my guess is i need some other function to stop processing until the fadeout is complete
[14:49:23] <Brodingo> you need to use the callbacks
[14:49:25] <drd> digitok-: because the fades happen asynchronously
[14:49:38] <digitok-> ohhh
[14:49:45] <Brodingo> the duration is for animation queue
[14:49:48] <digitok-> god i'm a fool
[14:49:53] <Brodingo> doesnt affect other methods
[14:50:01] <digitok-> i know exactly what to do now, thanks :)
[14:52:49] <trumpetmic> anyone?
[14:54:00] <digitok-> ok here's a follow up question
[14:54:19] <digitok-> say i'm doing the fadeout inside an if statement, then after that i want to set the text and fade in
[14:54:44] <digitok-> how do i tell the second statement to wait until the fadeout is done (if it's fading out)
[14:54:50] <trumpetmic> can anyone recommend a great pagination plugin?
[14:55:35] <digitok-> actually before you answer that, does fading something out make it :hidden ?
[14:56:05] <digitok-> basically my goal is, if (blah.is(':hidden')) { blah.fadeOut(1000); }
[14:58:46] <totallyvinny> trumpetmic: look at pajination
[14:59:02] <trumpetmic> totallyvinny: thanks!
[14:59:08] <totallyvinny> er pajinate
[14:59:23] <trumpetmic> right on
[14:59:24] <trumpetmic> thanks
[14:59:34] <k1t> how come I have to refresh my page for my slideshow to appear here: http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/?category=coffee-tea ?
[15:00:08] <digitok-> works fine for me
[15:00:29] <k1t> I'm in FF5, you?
[15:00:33] <digitok-> chrome
[15:00:39] <k1t> do you have FF
[15:00:40] <k1t> lol
[15:00:48] <trumpetmic> darn, looks like pajinate is client-side-only
[15:00:50] <digitok-> nope
[15:01:25] <k1t> really? :O
[15:01:34] <k1t> crazy, people are really diggin chrome lately
[15:01:43] <digitok-> i deleted it a couple months back
[15:01:43] <k1t> going to have to give it a spin again here
[15:01:44] <digitok-> heh
[15:01:58] <k1t> do you not test cross-browser? :x
[15:02:34] <digitok-> if i ever completed something i might
[15:03:36] <digitok-> so anyway, my code is basically: if (blah.is(':hidden')) { blah.fadeOut(1000); } blah.tex('hi').fadeIn(1000);
[15:03:42] <digitok-> text*
[15:04:00] <digitok-> and that if statement is negated sorry
[15:04:38] <digitok-> but yeah, if it's NOT hidden, fadeout, then fade in with new text, i need to not set the text until the fadeout is done (if it is doing it)
[15:04:48] <k1t> http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/?category=snack-foods works also?
[15:05:11] <digitok-> is the only way to set the text in the fadeout callback, then use an else statement setting the text also ?
[15:05:21] <phlp> digitok-: var foo = $('#foo'); if (!foo.is(':hidden')) { foo.fadeOut(1000); } foo.queue(function() { $(this).text('bar').fadeIn(1000).dequeue(); });
[15:05:31] <digitok-> ah, champ
[15:05:35] * digitok- tries
[15:05:56] <digitok-> you have to dequeue it?
[15:06:46] <phlp> for any future events to work
[15:07:09] <cccaldas> hi guys
[15:07:42] <digitok-> phlp: perfect, i'll check the api on queue(), thanks
[15:08:02] <cccaldas> why this $("#menu a").animate({color:"#00ff00"}, "slow"); doesnt work ?
[15:08:05] <phlp> np :)
[15:08:14] <digitok-> k1t: that one fails on initial pageload, refresh fixes it
[15:08:31] <Cork[home]> cccaldas: jquery doesn't do color animation without a plugin
[15:08:34] <digitok-> cccaldas: you need the color plugin to animate colours
[15:08:42] <digitok-> :>
[15:09:31] <cccaldas> hmmmm
[15:09:37] <k1t> digitok-: hmm
[15:09:37] <cccaldas> what plugin ?
[15:10:00] <GoGoGarrett> why doesn't this work >:[ http://jsfiddle.net/GoGoGarrett/gU5XY/  I'm using the bassistance.de validation plugin -which i included in the resources
[15:10:17] <trumpetmic> is anyone using jquery_pagination?  https://github.com/gbirke/jquery_pagination#readme
[15:11:31] <cccaldas> what plugin i need for color effects ?
[15:11:53] <digitok-> cccaldas: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[15:12:10] <digitok-> if you include that your current code should work
[15:13:20] <GoGoGarrett> you include jquery -> plugin correct?
[15:13:51] <GoGoGarrett> I'm hosting both on cdn's
[15:14:55] <cccaldas> yea
[15:14:58] <cccaldas> thanks digitok
[15:15:01] <digitok-> np
[15:15:02] <cccaldas> ˆˆ
[15:19:24] <larzen-wrk> how do i make something appear in "result" in jsfiddle?
[15:19:31] <GoGoGarrett> run
[15:19:41] <larzen-wrk> i need to output a string in there
[15:19:51] <larzen-wrk> I don't want to use console.log or alert('')
[15:21:01] <cccaldas> yup, it works
[15:21:10] <cccaldas> color effects :)
[15:21:18] <cccaldas> im as3 developer, jquery is new for me
[15:21:18] <digitok-> larzen-wrk: document.write()
[15:21:32] <digitok-> larzen-wrk: that what you meant?
[15:22:00] <digitok-> or indeed something like foo.innerHTML or $('#foo').html()
[15:22:04] <digitok-> either or
[15:22:20] <larzen-wrk> yes! thank you ;:)
[15:22:25] <digitok-> np
[15:22:56] <digitok-> for a jquery/js noob, i've helped 2 people in the last 20mins, not bad :p
[15:23:10] <cccaldas> lol
[15:23:11] <cccaldas> uheahuae
[15:23:19] <cccaldas> anyone likes as3 ?

[15:23:42] <JKarsrud> :P
[15:23:46] <Hexxeh> Hi
[15:24:12] <Hexxeh> Is there any way to have the jQuery UI slider element use three different background colours for the slider instead of two?
[15:24:35] <Hexxeh> I'm trying to use it to define a partitioning scheme, where you drag the boundaries between the partitions
[15:28:23] <mikemo> quick question -- i'm making a "thank you" modal after a form submission and i want the type with a very BIG x in the top right corner (preferably circled with a thick colored line). can i do this with jquery ui?
[15:29:42] <__name__> Do I have to encode data I put after the # of an URL?
[15:30:58] <Cork[home]> __name__: just so you know, whats after # in the url isn't sent to the server
[15:31:06] <__name__> Cork[home]: I know.
[15:31:25] <__name__> I just want to know if any browser will fuck up majorly if it does not like the data :)
[15:31:53] <Cork[home]> __name__: i think only a-z and 0-9 plus a few other characters
[15:31:59] <ngharo> mikemo: dialog.prev('.ui-dialog-titlebar').find('.ui-icon-closethick') should get you close
[15:32:05] <Cork[home]> one sec and i'll pull up the specs
[15:32:13] <__name__> Cork[home]: Oh thank you so much.
[15:33:09] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/GoGoGarrett/gU5XY/  I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me figure out why this isn't working.  I'm trying to use the validation plugin and I don't see my error.  :/
[15:35:02] <ngharo> Hexxeh: might be a little tricky.  If you inspect the slider it only has two divs for colors.  The entire bar (background color) and the current range color...
[15:35:27] <Hexxeh> ngharo: Any other element available via a plugin or otherwise that might be appropriate?
[15:37:19] <Cork[home]> __name__: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.5
[15:37:23] <digitok-> GoGoGarrett: http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/
[15:37:37] <Cork[home]> __name__: pchar is here: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3
[15:37:38] <GoGoGarrett> I've looked at their code, and mine I don't see any differences, but obvioulsy ther eis
[15:37:55] <digitok-> the one you pasted just says .validate()
[15:37:57] <ngharo> Hexxeh: you could append a new div for your color on create, and then hook into the 'slide' event to update it's position
[15:38:01] <digitok-> what's that meant to do
[15:38:28] <GoGoGarrett> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[15:38:42] <GoGoGarrett> the basic call to validate is just 1 line
[15:38:44] <digitok-> oh i see
[15:38:46] <digitok-> nm
[15:38:49] <GoGoGarrett> :/
[15:39:00] <__name__> Cork[home]: So I can pretty much put what I want in there?
[15:39:21] <Cork[home]> __name__: english characters, and a few special characters
[15:39:30] <Cork[home]> so it depends on what you mean anything
[15:39:32] <ngharo> Hexxeh: you could base position off of the .ui-slider-range element
[15:41:37] <Cork[home]> __name__:!$&'()*+,;= 0-9 a-z A-Z -._~:@/?
[15:41:43] <Cork[home]> __name__: and no spaces
[15:42:04] <__name__> So base64 works
[15:42:09] <Cork[home]> ya
[15:42:15] <__name__> Thank you a lot.
[15:42:21] * __name__ bows.
[15:42:23] <Cork[home]> you have the url max size to worry about those
[15:42:26] <Cork[home]> *though
[15:43:38] <__name__> It only seems to be a problem with IE
[15:43:44] <Cork[home]> __name__: the url (the complete url including http*) should never be longer then 2083
[15:43:54] <Cork[home]> ya, but it will fail badly
[15:44:01] <__name__> Other browsers seem to handle it.
[15:44:18] <__name__> And 2K should be enough.
[15:44:27] * Cork[home] nods
[15:44:49] <Cork[home]> base64 leaves you at a max of 64 chars so :)
[15:44:58] <Cork[home]> as it will put a line break after that
[15:45:09] <__name__> What?
[15:45:29] <Cork[home]> base64 encoding will line break after each 64 generated characters
[15:45:37] <larzen-wrk> folks... can someone look at this function and let me know whats going on? http://jsfiddle.net/MCBg9/18/
[15:45:41] <djQuery> with delgate if say I delegate on tbale click and tr click they always fire both correct.
[15:45:44] <Cork[home]> ikd email standards
[15:45:48] <Cork[home]> *old
[15:45:49] <djQuery> in which order?
[15:45:51] <__name__> Cork[home]: Well I can escape that.
[15:45:51] <larzen-wrk> i can't seem to figure out why the second date doesn't roll over
[15:47:10] <__name__> Cork[home]: And e.g. Python's base64 implementation is fine if you  just throw away the \n.
[15:47:32] <digitok-> GoGoGarrett: not sure, but shouldn't the class="required" be on the <input> element
[15:47:48] <Cork[home]> __name__: i'm not sure you can decode base64 without readding it though
[15:47:55] <Cork[home]> __name__: i THINK you can't
[15:48:15] <__name__> Cork[home]: If I need to it's not a big problem anyway
[15:48:20] <Cork[home]> (base64 can only handle 64 character long codes)
[15:48:39] <GoGoGarrett> ah you're right, this is sloppy code i inherited by someone else and it's a pain to look at.  I'll try that and see.
[15:49:10] <djQuery> digitok-: by the way <input type="email" required > breaks in the validation plugin with the 1.6
[15:50:23] <GoGoGarrett> good call, that worked. Thanks.
[15:50:55] <BinaryKitten> djQuery you know that type="email" is not currently a fully supported input type
[15:51:34] <ngharo> Hexxeh: http://jsfiddle.net/kat9w/
[15:52:15] <Hexxeh> ngharo: That's perfect, thanks!
[15:52:29] <ngharo> least i could do (happy chromeos user) :)
[15:55:38] <djQuery> BinaryKitten: yes it is all browsers support it.
[15:56:00] <djQuery> BinaryKitten: heck they all support <input type="asdflkasdfklsdflklkdasjflkjdsflkjsdf" >
[15:56:16] <djQuery> BinaryKitten: it will just display as a text
[15:56:28] <Hexxeh> ngharo: Oh, sweet, glad you're enjoying it :)
[15:56:43] <BinaryKitten> djQuery yes it will display like that youre correct
[15:56:48] <BinaryKitten> but it's not supported
[15:57:00] <BinaryKitten> thus you get unexpected results
[15:57:02] <chovy> does $("div").height() include margins?
[15:57:22] <djQuery> the html5 standard says that its supported. all agents should fall back to type="text"
[15:57:54] <multipass> hi, im having a problem with getting jquery plugins and function to load one after another (elements loading out of order etc), is there any good way to do this with callbacks or whatever?
[15:58:07] <djQuery> BinaryKitten: sorry ment the html4 standard
[15:58:25] <djQuery> heck ie5 supported it
[15:58:44] <digitok-> what does type="email" offer
[15:59:10] <BinaryKitten> djQuery no it's not Supported
[15:59:15] <BinaryKitten> it just has a fallback
[15:59:23] <BinaryKitten> unfortunately that's just for browser rendering
[15:59:34] <BinaryKitten> the fallback doesn't affect scripts
[15:59:46] <BinaryKitten> and type="email" will cause unexpected results
[15:59:51] <BinaryKitten> depending on the browser
[16:00:05] <djQuery> BinaryKitten: yeah maybe in ie 4
[16:00:25] <BinaryKitten> ffs
[16:00:31] <BinaryKitten> no in EVERYTHING
[16:00:34] <digitok-> lol
[16:00:53] <djQuery> digitok-: in html5 compatible browsers the browser itself will validate the email address.
[16:01:15] <digitok-> input type=email – e-mail address input control
[16:01:28] <digitok-> This markup feature is newly added in HTML5.
[16:01:30] <digitok-> that's from w3
[16:01:52] <b3ngt> newly?
[16:01:53] <BinaryKitten> which is not currently fully ratified and/or supported by all browsers
[16:02:00] <djQuery> digitok-: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Sxz7T/
[16:02:25] * BinaryKitten bashes her head against the wall
[16:02:46] <digitok-> which to me means it won't work in ie4
[16:02:47] <digitok-> lol
[16:03:04] <BinaryKitten> or 5
[16:03:05] <BinaryKitten> or 6
[16:03:06] <BinaryKitten> or 7
[16:03:08] <BinaryKitten> or 8
[16:03:10] <BinaryKitten> or 9
[16:03:31] <digitok-> we get the point
[16:03:36] <digitok-> i was just saying.
[16:03:59] <BinaryKitten> was accentuating the point for djQuery's sake
[16:04:31] <__name__> I hope IE dies.
[16:04:38] <BinaryKitten> IE won't die
[16:04:54] <BinaryKitten> Microsoft have too much vested interest in it
[16:04:56] <djQuery> it will die everywhere but china
[16:05:05] <djQuery> at least ie6 that is
[16:05:15] <BinaryKitten> IE10 is currently in production
[16:05:40] <BinaryKitten> it'll be IE12 before we see any real HTML5 support
[16:07:38] <djQuery> BinaryKitten: so we should never use any  of its features until that time
[16:07:40] <digitok-> djQuery: out of interest, how is delegate different than just doing $('foo').change() ?
[16:08:58] <BinaryKitten> delegate binds to teh parent. it says hey parent, when one of your children matching this selector does this event.. do this
[16:08:59] <djQuery> digitok-: .change only works if foo allready exists where as delegate will work for any foo that is added. although I have never seen a foo element
[16:09:18] <digitok-> well that was an example lol
[16:09:41] <digitok-> so you can .delegate first then .append a bunch of stuff and not have to delegate again basically?
[16:10:04] <BinaryKitten> djQuery  .. not saying you should not use any HTML5 features.. just expect certain things to not 100% work as expected
[16:10:12] <digitok-> so basically makes a "default" action for that element
[16:10:25] <digitok-> you can't expect anything to work in IE
[16:10:38] <digitok-> anyone using ie can gtfo :p
[16:11:09] * Enginoob likes that.
[16:13:08] * BinaryKitten uses IE
[16:13:24] <digitok-> djQuery?
[16:13:32] <digitok-> djQuery: confirm :p
[16:14:09] <fostah> When I run a function that appends an unknown amount of elements to the dom, how can I find out when it is finished?
[16:14:44] <fostah> and it does not have a callback function
[16:14:58] <djQuery> digitok-: the input still works as an input in ie5  ++ it just doesnt do automatic validation hence the need for the validation plugin.  not to mention that validation even in chrome just looks like crap
[16:15:30] <digitok-> djQuery: i didn't ask that :|
[16:15:42] <digitok-> oh, but ok
[16:15:46] <djQuery> mised the @ then
[16:16:09] <digitok-> meant about my .delegate definition above
[16:16:30] <djQuery> digitok-:  oh the append thing yes you can.
[16:17:28] <djQuery> digitok-: see ?.live

[16:19:11] <abjorn> :o
[16:22:59] <multipass> is there a way to wait for a function to finish before doing another? besides a interval
[16:23:41] <gkatsev> setTimeout
[16:26:48] <__name__> Cork[home]: It works fine if I just drop the newlines.
[16:27:29] <ravasthi> So, this might be crazy, but I just want to add the jqmobile event shortcuts to my app. is it ok to just add jquery.mobile.event.js as a dependency?
[16:28:15] <ravasthi> i've got vanilla jquery there already, of course.
[16:32:27] <multipass> is there a way to wait for a function to finish before doing another? besides a interval/timeout? im trying to edit stuff output by a plugin, but nothings happening
[16:32:47] <BinaryKitten> callbacks?
[16:39:03] <godza> Hi guys, can someone help me please with issue i having
[16:39:16] <godza> i would like to know how to find position()
[16:39:27] <godza> for some DOM element
[16:39:49] <godza> but for some other ancestor
[16:39:58] <godza> other than it's first nearest?
[16:42:56] <godza> anybody here?
[16:43:22] <multipass> BinaryKitten: i am doing callbacks, but the callback seems to be loaded right away, it dosnt wait for the stuff in the funtion to complete
[16:44:50] <chovy> is there now way to stringify a json object with jquery?

[16:45:58] <chovy> Cork[home]: what about older browsers, like IE7
[16:46:09] <Cork[home]> chovy: use json2
[16:46:13] <godza> i would like to know how to find position() offsets for some other offset ancestor other than nearest one

[16:52:53] <djQuery> who was I talkin about jsperf with earlier http://jsperf.com/dh-jquery-1-4-vs-1-6/6
[16:53:52] <rogeruiz> Hey
[16:54:18] <rogeruiz> I've got a question about something that came up at work
[16:55:34] <rogeruiz> A fellow front end developer may be making a switch to mootools for animation benefits and the rest of us were discussing maybe jQuery is up to snuff
[16:56:02] <coldhead> you mean up to scratch?
[16:56:09] <rogeruiz> Yes
[16:56:25] <coldhead> jQuery is a general purpose library
[16:56:38] <coldhead> i have usually found the animations up to my needs
[16:56:45] <rogeruiz> I see
[16:56:57] <coldhead> but if you are doing something really fine or delicate or sensitive then sure, there may be better libs for that
[16:57:12] <coldhead> you shouldn't have to abandon jQ just to use such things
[16:57:26] <rogeruiz> Yeah. I agree with that
[16:57:49] <rogeruiz> This really seems like a small case where another lib may be better
[16:58:03] <rogeruiz> I was curious if his idea had any merit though
[16:58:39] <draginx> Is jQuery unable to find ID attributed if I defined them like <img id='hello'> (single quotes) ?
[16:58:42] <rogeruiz> I know mootools was popular for animations back when jQuery was just starting, but I feel like theyre pretty good right now
[16:59:00] <coldhead> people often say mootools does better animations but i haven't seen it in the wild to know
[16:59:23] <rogeruiz> Hmm I see
[16:59:52] <rogeruiz> Thanks coldhead
[16:59:52] <rogeruiz> I appreciate you taking the time to answer my question
[17:00:20] <coldhead> if you were to move to mootools exclusively you'd have to justify leaving behind the many jQuery plugins
[17:00:27] <coldhead> and the extensive testing and support
[17:00:32] <coldhead> it'd be a tradeoff
[17:00:55] <rogeruiz> Yeah, I don't think I would feel comfortable doing that.
[17:00:55] <coldhead> i'd try to keep jQ and use a faster lib for animations if required
[17:00:59] <coldhead> but then i WOULD say that
[17:01:53] <rogeruiz> I think the benefit of MT would just be for fixing animation issues he may be having. Though, I feel like maybe he could get away with doing it in jQ
[17:01:54] <coldhead> rogeruiz: ask your cow orker to show you an actual demo of mootools doing better animations
[17:02:05] <coldhead> and if he can make the case, show us here too :)
[17:02:09] <rogeruiz> Good idea
[17:02:17] <rogeruiz> Oh i will.
[17:04:31] <Skizzerz> hey, I'm using jquery to enhance a table in which each tr is a record. For non-js compatiblity, the name of the record is a link to the record description page, but I'm using jquery to bind a click event to tr to follow that link as well (so they can click anywhere in the tr to visit it). However, when I right-click on the link and open in new tab, the original tab still follows the js and also goes to the record. Is there any way to stop this?
[17:05:08] <coldhead> you want to ignore right clicks?
[17:05:25] <Skizzerz> no, I want it to not go to that page if I open the link in a new tab
[17:05:46] <Skizzerz> basically, I want the click event to fire as long as the link itself wasn't the click target, but I'm not sure how

[17:08:07] <Skizzerz> hmm, I think I thought of something that might work
[17:08:45] <rogeruiz> Skizzerz: What's that?
[17:08:48] <rogeruiz> Im curious
[17:08:54] <Skizzerz> testing if $(this) is an a element
[17:09:13] <Skizzerz> and then using delegate instead of bind
[17:09:23] <Skizzerz> or... wait, maybe that wouldn't work
[17:10:17] <rogeruiz> So is the main tab still going to the link?
[17:10:39] <Skizzerz> yeah, that's the issue. the main tab is following the link due to my js, even when I open the link in a new tab
[17:10:43] <rogeruiz> Does this still happen on Command/Ctrl click?
[17:10:43] <rogeruiz> Mac/PC
[17:11:07] <rogeruiz> Right, though your example only mentioned the right lick.
[17:11:08] <rogeruiz> Click*
[17:11:30] <Skizzerz> well, if I left-click the link, it visits it in the same tab anyway :)
[17:12:05] <rogeruiz> I mean left click while holding down a modifier like command on the mac and Ctrl on the PC
[17:12:20] <rogeruiz> Im curious if it still is happening there
[17:12:27] <Skizzerz> yes, still happens
[17:12:52] <Skizzerz> in fact, that's probably what the issue is, I just tried right-clicking and it worked properly (I ran into the issue when middle-clicking, which I have configured to open in a new tab)
[17:13:06] <Skizzerz> and I assumed that it would follow the same general process as right-clicking, guess not
[17:13:16] <rogeruiz> I see
[17:13:18] <rogeruiz> Hmm
[17:13:28] <Skizzerz> but middle-click and ctrl+left click exhibit the undesired behavior, right clicking and selecting open in new tab does not
[17:13:33] <Skizzerz> this is on chrome
[17:14:26] <rogeruiz> Im still pretty green when it comes to JS & jQ, though I would think you could find a target reference from the click event
[17:14:49] <Skizzerz> yeah, that's what I'm thinking now too
[17:18:14] <rogeruiz> Im on my phone so you'll have to bear with my multitasking
[17:18:57] <Skizzerz> yes, that works, thanks
[17:19:10] <Skizzerz> if($(e.target).is('a')) return true;
[17:19:28] <rogeruiz> Bam
[17:19:31] <rogeruiz> Sweet
[17:20:27] <rogeruiz> Glad that worked
[17:30:52] <draginx> how can i make it so a click on <label for> a radio button triggers an event?
[17:31:31] <draginx> nvm
[17:50:54] <visua> o/
[17:51:23] <visua> I'm looking for some advice/help if anyone is interested
[17:51:43] <visua> http://www.visua/us/lab/wall/test.html
[17:51:47] <visua> Having some issues
[17:52:01] <draginx> $20
[17:52:08] <draginx> I will give u any advice that u need
[17:52:09] <draginx> for $20
[17:52:10] <visua> I'll get right on that.
[17:52:14] <visua> next
[17:52:38] <draginx> ur website doesnt work l-o-l
[17:52:45] <draginx>  /us/lab/wall/test.html is not a TLD :(
[17:52:49] <visua> http://visua.us/lab/wall/test.html
[17:52:51] <visua> whoops
[17:52:52] <visua> :P
[17:52:56] <draginx> :P
[17:52:57] <visua> silly me.
[17:53:03] <draginx> looks sexy
[17:53:15] <djQuery> is there a more performant way to get the index of the current item other than $(this).prevUntil().length  ?
[17:53:20] <draginx> If there r no nudes though i am NOT interested ;x
[17:53:25] <visua> minus the crazy flickering on resize :|
[17:53:58] <visua> It seems brute forced, and my mind isn't allowing me to think of a sexier way to do this
[17:54:04] <draginx> visua: its suppose to stretch full screen?
[17:54:10] <visua> draginx: yeah
[17:54:39] <draginx> lets try 1.6.2? :P but hmm
[17:54:44] <draginx> width: 100%;
[17:54:48] <draginx> i think that is the culprit of ur problems
[17:54:52] <draginx> this might be a CSS issue tbh
[17:55:23] <visua> That is undoubtely part of it.
[17:55:23] <draginx> since its going to try to keep on recalculating 100%
[17:55:39] <djQuery> dangit some one had a throttling script that would keep that from running to often
[17:56:03] <visua> Hm, let me try adding a wrapper
[17:56:50] <djQuery> jsut as long as u dont use css expressions to do the calculation
[17:57:18] <visua> not sure what you mean
[18:08:45] <visua> going up is now smooth..going down, not so much..
[18:09:23] <draginx> visua: ud need to find out how many images
[18:09:28] <draginx> are being displayed across horzontally
[18:09:56] <draginx> then maintain that # / scale those image sizes down as the person moves their browser size
[18:10:15] <visua> draginx: well, I want them to adjust though.
[18:10:41] <visua> So they are always 'trying to be big', if that makes sense, just stretching a bit to fill the browser.
[18:10:45] <draginx> yeah ur not going to ever get a good transition on a browser with that lol
[18:10:52] <visua> Also, on the iphone they have one single image across
[18:10:59] <visua> iPad you might have 3, and so on.
[18:11:13] <visua> I dunno, this guy did it: http://kamchatka.es/themes/templates/folio-series/folio-two/advanced/index.html#
[18:11:42] <draginx> yeah its not "smooth"
[18:11:55] <visua> True, just much smoother than mine :\
[18:12:19] <draginx> lol
[18:12:32] <visua> going to look at his js now
[18:12:57] <tbranyen> pretty smooth for me
[18:13:39] <visua> I'm fighting the browser on floating the list elements
[18:13:44] <visua> thats got to be why its flickering
[18:13:52] <draginx> o-o
[18:13:56] <draginx> display:inline-block plz =x
[18:15:03] <visua> :\ nope
[18:16:24] <visua> im giving this one more hour before i goto the bar :O
[18:16:25] <visua> lol
[18:20:31] <djQuery> is there a more performant way to get the index of the current item other than $(this).prevUntil().length  ?
[18:20:56] <visua> djQuery: I don't know, sorry :( I'm an as3 developer making the transision haha
[18:21:00] * visua hides
[18:26:05] <djQuery> this is pretty cool http://www.xiconeditor.com/
[18:35:32] <TrueColors> Is it possible to slide toa nother width?
[18:35:35] <TrueColors> i mean, height.
[18:36:55] <djQuery> TrueColors: see ?animate
[18:36:55] <bot-t> TrueColors, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[18:37:10] <djQuery> TrueColors: or see ?ui.toggleclass
[18:37:13] <bot-t> TrueColors, UI/Effects/toggleClass - Adds the specified class if it is not present, and removes the specified class if it is present, using an optional transition. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/toggleClass
[18:38:39] <TrueColors> .animate... height: 'toggle' ?
[18:38:57] <TrueColors> whats the toggle bit for.
[18:39:20] <djQuery> think with animate you hve to toell it what the new height is.
[18:39:51] <djQuery> there is also .slideDown .slideup etc
[18:41:18] <pilgrim> How would I do something like this: $('myElem').div.span?
[18:41:50] <draginx> what exactly r u trying ot do?
[18:43:19] <pilgrim> draginx: I'm just trying to access the first child (which is a div element)
[18:43:36] <draginx> $('myElem div')
[18:44:16] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/ that works :) thanks djQuery
[18:44:31] <TrueColors> Is there any easier way to put it, I mean... some form of toggle instead of having to ... do the if?
[18:45:48] <TrueColors> var setHeight = ($('#toggle').height() == 10) ? 100 : 10;
[18:45:51] <TrueColors> is a possibility I guess.
[18:47:19] <visua> I'm running out of time! oh noes :(
[18:49:23] <pilgrim> draginx: What if I have this: $('#myElemID').find('#someLostChild') and I want to access someLostChild's div child?
[18:49:46] <draginx> append .find('div')
[18:49:51] <draginx> or #someLostChild div
[18:51:17] <pilgrim> draginx: Thanks, that works.
[18:51:23] <draginx> yup
[19:03:27] <djQuery> TrueColors: well first off you should cache $toggle = $('#toggle');
[19:03:48] <TrueColors> cache?
[19:03:49] <TrueColors> why?
[19:06:00] <rewt> you're running the selector more than once; more efficient to run it just once and cache it
[19:06:17] <devinrolsen> so the browser doesn't have to keep hunting for the the element with the id of toggle each time.
[19:08:46] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/4/
[19:08:48] <TrueColors> here's my full code.
[19:08:49] <TrueColors> it's kinda nasty.
[19:08:53] <TrueColors> but it's in it's working form.
[19:09:16] <TrueColors> you'd click the white square on the right hand side to... toggle it
[19:09:39] <djQuery> TrueColors: did you look at see ?ui.toggleclass
[19:09:40] <bot-t> TrueColors, UI/Effects/toggleClass - Adds the specified class if it is not present, and removes the specified class if it is present, using an optional transition. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/toggleClass
[19:11:27] <djQuery> TrueColors: and never do $('#id1 #id2') it causes it not to use the native getElementById and slows it down
[19:11:45] <TrueColors> mm
[19:12:37] <rewt> djQuery, how would you do that?  $('#id1').find('#id2') ?
[19:12:58] <djQuery> $('#id2')
[19:13:08] <djQuery> thats all its go resolve to anyway
[19:13:38] <rewt> oh, in his case, yes
[19:13:51] <djQuery> internaly thats what jquery will do. but it wont do that if you do $('#id1 #id2')
[19:14:02] <djQuery> rewt: or your example.
[19:14:27] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/VPw5U/ I tested out the toggleClass... when you first click the p's, it bugs out. It'll change the class then instantly change it back. Any further clicks of the same p works fine.
[19:14:34] <TrueColors> (I actually just took the example)
[19:15:05] <TrueColors> $('#id1').find('#id2') ... would be better than doing $('#id2') or changing the id of the bannerAd, because... the same ad could be used as where.
[19:15:10] <djQuery> hmmm thas kinda weird
[19:15:34] <djQuery> true that would be worse than doing $('#id2')
[19:16:09] <TrueColors> but anyway, that toggleClass would work for like... if I was just changing the class...
[19:16:14] <TrueColors> but I need to change the html inside of it too.
[19:16:19] <TrueColors> or simply... just hide one, show the other
[19:16:32] <djQuery> u are never gonna beat .getElementByID    but what you are doing with the $('#id1').find('#id2')  first use .getElementById then do it again
[19:16:59] <TrueColors> I know in that instance, it just says "Advert Here" but the idea is... there is a big banner advert, then when you "minimize it" per say, it'll use a text advert.
[19:17:07] <djQuery> TrueColors: use toggleclass for the color\height stuff then do the hmlt seperately
[19:17:19] <TrueColors> how would I do the html separately?
[19:17:52] <djQuery> .toggleClass('whatever', 500, function(){do html here})
[19:17:58] <TrueColors> ah.
[19:18:02] <TrueColors> let me see what i can do
[19:18:10] <TrueColors> wait..
[19:18:16] <djQuery> the function wont run until the toggle is done though
[19:18:23] <TrueColors> the classname is 'whatever'
[19:18:34] <TrueColors> how can I have it... pick between 'whatever' and 'somethingelse' ?
[19:18:45] <TrueColors> or would I have an if statement to set the class?
[19:18:56] <djQuery> just give it whatever to start with and toggle something else.
[19:19:13] <TrueColors> yeah but how do I go back to whatever when I'm at somethingelse?
[19:19:17] <TrueColors> or ..
[19:19:23] <TrueColors> is that what that does.
[19:19:26] <djQuery> so whatever sets its initial prop and somethingelse overrides them
[19:20:05] <djQuery> toggleclass first checks to see if it has the class that you are toggleing if so it removes it and vice versa
[19:22:04] <draginx> if im changing attr('src') on an image.. is there a way to detect if its still loading the new image? :)
[19:22:50] <TrueColors> how would you get a divs class name?
[19:22:56] <TrueColors> oh nevermind.
[19:23:02] <TrueColors> $("#id").attr("class")
[19:25:16] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/7/
[19:25:17] <TrueColors> it's not doing anything lol
[19:25:46] <djQuery> click the jslint button TrueColors
[19:26:19] <djQuery> ?.hasclass@ TrueColors
[19:26:20] <bot-t> TrueColors, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[19:26:23] <TrueColors> ooo errors too lol
[19:27:28] <djQuery> and instead of doing that at all you could just do .toggle
[19:27:34] <Enginoob> What are colons used for in selectors?  ie, $(":radio");
[19:28:00] <djQuery> those are very slow pseudo selectors
[19:28:04] <djQuery> ?pseudo
[19:28:07] <bot-t> djQuery, #7291 (Unknown pseudo-class or pseudo-element 'sizzle'.)  jQuery ... - Opened 9 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7291
[19:28:29] <Enginoob> Why slow?
[19:28:51] <djQuery> Enginoob: $('input').find(':radio') would be faster
[19:29:13] <Enginoob> Because it builds an array of the inputs first?
[19:30:13] <djQuery> Enginoob: because there is no native to the browser method of getting that. it basicaly does this $('*').each(function(i, elm){ if ($(elm).attr('type') === 'radio) ....}
[19:30:29] <Sora_> would like to add a scope...
[19:31:02] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/12/ djQuery, ... it's not showing the smaller ad :P
[19:31:15] <djQuery> TrueColors: good I hate adds
[19:31:50] <TrueColors> Same here, I won't go heavy on them. I limit myself to 2 per page, unlike some sites which go mental
[19:32:06] <TrueColors> I won't have any subscription services, so I'm relying on the adverts to generate a couple of pennies.
[19:32:24] <Enginoob> djQuery: You rock.  Thank ya.  I'm a complete n00b to jQuery.  Know programming fundamentals, but this is my first foray into jQuery.
[19:33:08] <TrueColors> hm..
[19:33:13] <TrueColors> djQuery, it appends the class name.
[19:33:15] <TrueColors> that's not what I wanted.
[19:33:25] <TrueColors> but i think i got an idea.
[19:35:26] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/13/ hm..
[19:35:32] <TrueColors> it's toggling the class, just not changing the height
[19:35:39] <Sora_> if only use slideup in the ad ? and no touch "advert"
[19:36:18] <TrueColors> #header_beta has a height of 90px, but .hbs has 21px. I assume because <div id="#header_beta" class="hbs"> ... it would do the 21px
[19:36:20] <TrueColors> but obviously not
[19:36:23] <TrueColors> so I'm a bit stuck
[19:36:40] <Sora_> use css only
[19:36:51] <TrueColors> i am...
[19:36:56] <TrueColors> I have a toggle button.
[19:36:58] <TrueColors> to toggle the height
[19:36:59] <TrueColors> ...
[19:37:20] <visua> muhaha i got the effect finally
[19:37:25] <Sora_> but text div with zindex 1
[19:37:27] <visua> only took 2.5 hours :|
[19:37:28] <Sora_> add zindex 2
[19:37:34] <Sora_> and only move the ad
[19:37:43] <Sora_> sry my english
[19:37:52] <TrueColors> "only move the ad" ... I need the change the height of the parent.
[19:38:02] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/5/ like that.
[19:39:31] <TrueColors> Why are id's more dominant than classes :/
[19:40:30] <djQuery> Enginoob: TrueColors: see ?jqf
[19:40:31] <bot-t> Enginoob, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[19:41:09] <TrueColors> Yeah I don't see how this helps...
[19:41:14] <djQuery> TrueColors: you should see what I am working on. http://jsbin.com/uxenub/63/edit
[19:41:32] <djQuery> TrueColors: u seem to be missing a few of the basics is all
[19:41:57] <Enginoob> djQuery: If you need any help with that, just let me know.  ;)
[19:42:16] <Enginoob> Thank you for the link.
[19:42:57] <TrueColors> the basics being ID's are more dominant :/
[19:43:10] <TrueColors> the id is overwriting the classes height, yet hte class is defined afterwards.
[19:43:14] <TrueColors> kinda making my life difficult.
[19:44:42] <djQuery> jsut what rich functions are avalible to you.   var x = $('whatever');   $('$somethingelse').slideToggle();
[19:45:44] <djQuery> #something {height: 100px; } #something.minimized { height: 10px; }
[19:47:38] <djQuery> #add { height: 100%;  }  }.minimized #add { display: none; }
[19:48:25] <TrueColors> #header_beta.hbs worked... but i still have that dodgey bug just like the first.
[19:48:28] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/16/
[19:48:46] <chrismorris> how can I remove a user from a database when they leave the page?
[19:48:49] <chrismorris> i tried an ajax call on window.unload() but it doesn't seem to be catching
[19:49:10] <djQuery> TrueColors: try calling .stop(true, true).hide();   same for show
[19:49:16] <djQuery> ?.stop
[19:49:16] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[19:50:12] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/18/ never fixed it.
[19:50:17] <djQuery> chrismorris: do to security issues u cant do much on window.unload think all you can do is show a confirm
[19:50:59] <chrismorris> djQuery - so I need to perform some kind of check on the database from the server?
[19:51:29] <chrismorris> I only want to populate my database with users that are currently on the website
[19:51:31] <djQuery> chrismorris: what backend are u using? .net has a session end
[19:51:39] <chrismorris> yes - asp.net

[19:55:22] <reduxo> http://pastebin.com/80WX7RAR    Does anyone have any ideas how I could cut down on the repetitiveness of this block of code?
[19:56:37] <TrueColors> i have a breif idea reduxo, but it probably won't work
[19:56:53] <reduxo> TrueColors: Shoot, im open to ideas
[19:57:36] <djQuery> what does nomalizepath do?
[19:58:12] <djQuery> and changing the src of scripts is gonna cause them to run again.
[19:58:35] <reduxo> djQuery: Just a function i have later in my code to clean up the destination,  workds for urls
[19:58:49] <reduxo> djQuery: Ik but in this application its taken care of
[19:59:26] <djQuery> well causing the script to run again could cause issues depending on the script. but gues it wont matter as the browser will allready hvae it cached.
[19:59:39] <TrueColors> http://pastebin.com/KGefRrW3 reduxo ...
[19:59:42] <reduxo> djQuery: I'm working with a document before its run,,, its an iframe's content, then after i clean up some stuff
[19:59:42] <djQuery> sounds like something that shoulda been done right server side in the first palce
[19:59:45] <TrueColors> it's a little bit less repetative :P
[20:00:26] <TrueColors> Not sure if you can do: $(domNode).find("img, script").each( foo (index, domElement, "src"); ); though
[20:00:30] <TrueColors> so I took the safest route
[20:00:46] <djQuery> TrueColors: yes you can
[20:01:24] <TrueColors> In that case... http://pastebin.com/v9ZfF1Ur
[20:02:06] <reduxo> TrueColor: mmm thats nice :)
[20:02:48] <djQuery> reduxo: are these your iframes or someone elses? see ?sop
[20:02:48] <bot-t> reduxo, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[20:03:29] <reduxo> My own content loading into the iframes
[20:03:35] <reduxo> with dirty linking
[20:04:09] <reduxo> Lol, yes i know a dirty solution to a dirty problem :X
[20:07:30] <TrueColors> This may be pretty buggy reduxo, http://pastebin.com/8asxhyCi and it may not work to what you want... but I took a wild guess. Basically the idea is, is to loop through the array which has the attribute with it's... thing to find.
[20:07:36] <TrueColors> and only specify the block of code once.
[20:07:44] <TrueColors> but I'm sure djQuery will say it's not going to work :P
[20:08:15] <TrueColors> syntax error on line 6 btw, should be } and not ) at the end
[20:09:23] <reduxo> TrueColors: I like your implementation http://pastebin.com/v9ZfF1Ur but where is the index var coming from?
[20:09:48] <Sora_> u dont need index
[20:09:49] <Sora_> xD
[20:10:04] <TrueColors> I have no idea reduxo. You have it in your original paste.
[20:10:10] <Sora_> lol
[20:10:22] <reduxo> TrueColor: Haha, my mistake
[20:10:32] <tbranyen> thats not really valid code
[20:10:36] <tbranyen> i'm guessing its just an example?
[20:11:04] * TrueColors doesn't expect any of his code to work. :)
[20:11:04] <coldhead> this isn't a dress rehearsal people
[20:11:20] <tbranyen> get rid of all the paremeters and just pass foo
[20:11:26] <tbranyen> for all of them
[20:11:49] <TrueColors> why, domElement is used in the function foo ...
[20:11:50] <TrueColors> ?
[20:11:56] <TrueColors> and the attribute.
[20:12:03] <TrueColors> index isn't though
[20:12:28] <tbranyen> TrueColors: right but first off you're putting a line terminator inside parens
[20:12:31] <tbranyen> which is invalid
[20:12:46] <tbranyen> second you're just executing all those functions immediately and then running the each on undefined
[20:12:57] <tbranyen> which makes no sense
[20:13:40] <TrueColors> You mean...
[20:13:41] <TrueColors> $(domNode).find("a, link").each(
[20:13:44] <TrueColors> domNode is undefined?
[20:14:23] <tbranyen> http://pastebin.com/VCEnn42K
[20:14:26] <tbranyen> something like that
[20:14:37] <tbranyen> but then adding in the third parameter
[20:15:48] <TrueColors> http://pastebin.com/KGefRrW3 that's what I did first for him. Which I suppose is "closer" to yours.
[20:16:13] <tbranyen> yeah thats better
[20:16:50] <TrueColors> http://pastebin.com/9xiUmW42 what about this one?
[20:16:51] <TrueColors> :P
[20:19:52] <_41Ph4_> hi
[20:20:09] <_41Ph4_> is it possible to capture only "alerts" using ajax?
[20:21:15] <buymeasoda> capture alerts?
[20:21:21] <buymeasoda> you could remap the alert function
[20:21:24] <buymeasoda> alert = function () {
[20:21:24] <buymeasoda>     // your ajax here
[20:21:25] <buymeasoda> }
[20:21:58] <buymeasoda> not sure why you'd want to do that though
[20:22:33] <_41Ph4_> i'm trying to get SWF objects from a web page
[20:22:52] <_41Ph4_> can't do that using php as DOM functions won't get object/embed tag
[20:23:04] <draginx> Is .ajaxStart() really sketchy in terms of "working"? :P
[20:52:32] <TrueColors> djQuery ... http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/30/ this is much neater !
[20:59:35] <djQuery> cool
[21:01:50] <jqreilly> hello
[21:02:22] <jqreilly> No javascript errors are being outputted in XHR callbacks
[21:02:33] <jqreilly> This does not normally happen, but has happened before.
[21:02:35] <jqreilly> Happs sometimes.
[21:02:46] <jqreilly> Very frustrating. Why does this happen and how can I prevent it from happening?
[21:02:53] <jqreilly> *Happens
[21:03:05] <coldhead> don't have errors
[21:03:11] <coldhead> case closed
[21:03:22] <jqreilly> so if I just do something like 'ergerge;' it just stops exeuting any code after that but will fail silently.
[21:03:40] <jqreilly> coldhead, the point of a debugger is to fix errors
[21:03:57] <systemfault> Hmm what? :/
[21:04:13] <jqreilly> or the error messages
[21:04:17] <jqreilly> so that you know they exist, so you can fix them
[21:04:21] <systemfault> A debugger is a tool to help _you_ to fix errors
[21:04:28] <jqreilly> yeah
[21:04:41] <jqreilly> point is, the browser should output the errors
[21:04:50] <jqreilly> it doesn't even seem to always happen.. can't figure it out
[21:06:35] <jqreilly> chrome is being kinder right now and reporting the error properly
[21:06:43] <jqreilly> and ff at work seems to as well
[21:06:48] <jqreilly> don't effin get it
[21:06:48] <systemfault> chrome is the best ;)
[21:07:00] <jqreilly> yeah.. but no proper firebug
[21:07:01] <systemfault> Browser war!
[21:07:07] <jqreilly> I agree with you..
[21:07:17] <systemfault> There's nothing that firebug does that recent chrome can't do.
[21:08:03] <jqreilly> yeah.. maybe I should check out their profiler more
[21:08:09] <djQuery> jqreilly: let me get this straight chrome is not as good as ff because you dont have to install a plugin ?
[21:08:25] <jqreilly> no, I like chrome more
[21:08:29] <jqreilly> a plugin?
[21:08:37] <djQuery> firebug
[21:08:43] <jqreilly> oh, I just like firebug
[21:08:51] <jqreilly> Probably because I'm used to it more than anything.
[21:09:03] <jqreilly> When I first checked out Chrome's profiler it seemed weak in comparison
[21:09:12] <jqreilly> but that might have been old.
[21:09:13] <systemfault> Firebug used to be better..
[21:09:17] <systemfault> But it changed.
[21:09:33] <jqreilly> Chrome's profiler changed or Firebug got worse?
[21:09:37] <TrueColors> when did it change?
[21:09:51] <systemfault> The chrome profiler has always been better :/
[21:10:19] <jqreilly> it's faster
[21:10:35] <jqreilly> anything to do with chrome is faster usually
[21:11:42] <coldhead> you can't dismiss chrome's dev tools without watching http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[21:11:58] <coldhead> because there is a bunch of awesome hardly anyone has used yet
[21:12:19] <coldhead> like exporting to files? and live editing of existing JS? zomg
[21:12:30] <TrueColors> I dislike firebug because when you hover over an element, it doesn't display the width/height on the page unlike chrome does.
[21:12:37] <TrueColors> though i haven't tested out the beta
[21:12:55] <djQuery> like the files u can create from the css edits u do
[21:13:55] <systemfault> One stupid thing in chrome dev tools though....
[21:14:03] <systemfault> Padding VS Margin.
[21:14:10] <systemfault> Which is which.
[21:16:50] <TrueColors> margin is a dark blue, and padding is like a light blue.
[21:17:14] <systemfault> TrueColors: Not easy enough to differentiate
[21:18:11] <TrueColors> http://vvcap.net/db/HI0jYBYXgwB9jMEn7T1x.htp (image) ... the bottom blue part, is a 10px bottom margin. the innerl lighter blue parts of the div is the padding.
[21:18:14] <TrueColors> i can see it fine?
[21:18:19] <TrueColors> i've actually not had any problems with it
[21:19:04] <systemfault> I just think padding should have a different olor
[21:19:06] <systemfault> *color
[21:19:11] <systemfault> (Or margin)
[21:19:45] <TrueColors> djQuery, http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/35/ ... when you double click, it's suppose to kind of .. reverse back. It doesn't work when it's the big ad, but when it's the small ad... double click the white button and you'll see what I mean.
[21:19:56] <TrueColors> I know the problem, it's the setHeight that's causing it. I just can't seem to fix it.
[21:23:52] <djQuery> TrueColors: http://addyosmani.com/jqprovenperformance/
[21:25:12] <jqreilly> so anyone know what the deal is with ff not reporting errors in an XHR callback?
[21:26:44] <cronin> i'm having an issue similar to what this person is explaining here: http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=007f9150e46877c2. Anyone know how to avoid having jQuery stop (or in Firefox slow down) when the tab is unfocused
[21:27:34] <TrueColors> yes, any links you say I'll read but I do need this issue fixed .. like ... now? I mean it can't be too hard because.. yeah. it's just something simple.
[21:27:45] <ModFather> Hi all, using Jquery last version  but i have problem with IE6
[21:27:57] <TrueColors> if I had == 90 on the ternary, it'll not work for the big ad, but if i had < 90, it'll not work for the small ad.
[21:28:07] <Sora_> truecolor is for pseudo-selector
[21:28:35] <TrueColors> I don't need a selector do I?
[21:28:45] <Sora_> no no djQuery link
[21:29:05] <Sora_> pseudo-selector = "slow"
[21:29:29] <djQuery> Sora_: yeah whats ur point?
[21:29:48] <djQuery> oh ur telling him to look at the link I posted him
[21:29:59] <Sora_> that was why you sent the link
[21:30:22] <Sora_> 0:23	<djQuery> TrueColors: http://addyosmani.com/jqprovenperformance/
[21:31:26] <Jantire> So my mouseleave event is not registering
[21:31:27] <Jantire> http://pastie.org/2186345
[21:31:30] <Jantire> jQuery's loaded
[21:31:34] <Jantire> the mouseneter works just fine
[21:31:52] <TrueColors> I'm not using a selector...
[21:31:58] <TrueColors> I'm confused.
[21:31:58] <systemfault> Sora_: Thanks for the link :)
[21:32:01] <TrueColors> I just want a fix :/
[21:32:02] <Jantire> https://gist.github.com/c5455fd30933b2579704 is the HTML
[21:33:08] <Jantire> nvm
[21:33:17] <jqreilly> now chrome too
[21:33:24] <jqreilly> sometimes chrome is failing silently...
[21:33:27] <jqreilly> what's going on
[21:38:31] <jqreilly> screw technology
[21:38:37] <systemfault> Sora_: The author seems to emphasize too much on the slowness of selectors when in reality.. it doesn't matter.
[21:39:36] <TrueColors> ok djQuery, selectors are slow, but that doesn't solve my problem
[21:39:54] <Sora_> everything is relative .. much depends on the structure of the dom
[21:39:55] <systemfault> TrueColors: I missed the beginning, what is the problem? :/
[21:40:24] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/35/ double click the ... toggle (white box on the right) and it will still go to the small ad
[21:40:28] <TrueColors> double click it when it's on the small ad, and it works fine
[21:40:36] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/38/ this is hte opposite.
[21:40:45] <TrueColors> so it's being caused by the setHeight
[21:40:47] <Sora_> sry my english... google trans
[21:41:10] <systemfault> It's okay, don't worry.
[21:41:16] <systemfault> We've seen worse.
[21:42:04] <systemfault> TrueColors: Ah, let me check
[21:43:31] <Sora_> http://jsfiddle.net/KSjtw/40/
[21:43:36] <Sora_> True
[21:44:35] <systemfault> Seems that Sora_ got it :)
[21:49:51] <aaairc> this is probably a basic question... But how do you adjust the width of a jqueryUI button, that is a checkbox?
[21:50:16] <aaairc> i'm not sure how to change the css because its not a div... its an "<input ..."
[21:52:11] <Paveloosha> @<aaairc>, you need to set attribute of the input field..
[21:52:54] <aaairc> like <input type-"checkbox" style="width: 500px" /> ?
[21:53:10] <Paveloosha> @<aaairc> $('input').attr('width','100');
[21:53:10] <aaairc> i tried setting the style like that and it didn't work
[21:53:22] <aaairc> cool thanks
[21:53:23] <Paveloosha> style may not work
[21:54:05] <systemfault> You can't really style checkboxes afaik.
[21:54:51] <systemfault> But to properly target a checkbox, you would use: $('input[type="checkbox"]')
[21:55:01] <systemfault> Probably that jquery has a shortcut..
[21:55:13] <systemfault> Like $('input:checkbox') but I'm not sure
[21:55:30] <Sora_> system!!
[21:55:31] <Sora_> pseudo-selectors is evil
[21:55:34] <Sora_> lol
[21:56:10] <sergeymasushko> If I place a table under a tab ( ui.tab ) with the theme ui darkness, the text inside <td> becomes in black color on black background... someone knows how to fix it?
[21:56:47] <systemfault> Sora_: They're not.
[21:56:52] <Sora_> xD
[21:56:54] <Sora_> is joke
[21:56:58] <systemfault> :)
[21:57:11] <systemfault> Sora_: Where are you from?
[21:57:26] <systemfault> I'm a canadian from Montreal
[21:57:34] <Sora_> im chilean
[21:57:43] <systemfault> Ah cool :)
[21:57:43] <Sora_> south america =P
[21:57:59] <TrueColors> If you were female, I could say "you must be hot like a chili"
[21:58:00] <TrueColors> lol
[21:58:00] <buribu> brasil?
[21:58:04] <TrueColors> blah
[21:58:06] <TrueColors> chilli ...
[21:58:06] <systemfault> Too bad we never hear from you guys unless some miners get stuck :(
[21:59:00] <buribu> olah que tal?
[21:59:04] <Sora_> haha
[21:59:07] <Sora_> hola que tal?
[21:59:47] <Sora_> systemfault: well is a country that is almost the end of the world so it is understandable ^^;
[22:01:24] <TrueColors> me no comprende mucho espanol
[22:01:39] <Sora_> xD
[22:01:40] <TrueColors> me hablar ingles
[22:02:18] <systemfault> Una cerveza por favor? :/
[22:02:18] <TrueColors> I prefer german

[22:02:30] <Sora_> que sean 2 cervezas!
[22:02:32] <TrueColors> una? are you a girl? lol
[22:02:44] <systemfault> TrueColors: I don't know anything about spanish...
[22:02:48] <systemfault> I'm a man
[22:02:56] <Enginoob> Cerveza is feminine, I believe.
[22:02:57] <Enginoob> So.
[22:02:59] <Sora_> una cerveza
[22:03:04] <Enginoob> Uno would be incorrect tense.
[22:03:04] <Sora_> is one beer
[22:03:16] <systemfault> I only speak french and english... like most people from Quebec.
[22:03:34] <TrueColors> I don't but this language.. well "hola que tal" is spanish. So I followed the role lol
[22:03:52] <TrueColors> I know in spanish, the o's is for male, and a's are for female..
[22:03:54] <TrueColors> chica... chico...
[22:04:06] <Enginoob> Yeah, but it's for the recipient of the modifier.
[22:04:06] <tmayr> wow amazing, another chilean
[22:04:17] <TrueColors> but .. uno... uno = one
[22:04:19] <TrueColors> uno dos..
[22:04:21] <Sora_> tmayr: eres chileno ?
[22:04:24] <tmayr> si
[22:04:25] <TrueColors> una...
[22:04:27] <Sora_> ahh nice
[22:04:31] <tmayr> :D
[22:04:32] <TrueColors> i have no f-in clue. I'm goin to sleep, goodnight :P
[22:04:42] <Enginoob> Uno <masculine>, Una <feminine>
[22:04:44] <Enginoob> :P
[22:04:49] <Sora_> TrueColors: adew ^^;
[22:04:55] <aaairc> systemfault: i tried setting the width attribute on the checkbox but that doesn't seem to do anything
[22:05:12] * Enginoob goes back to watching Dexter. :P
[22:05:23] <tmayr> :o
[22:05:24] <systemfault> aaairc: I tried for fun, it justs increase the "box"
[22:05:28] <TrueColors> I'll meet you in the laboratory, Enginoob ;)
[22:05:32] <systemfault> aaairc: Not, the checkbox itself
[22:05:33] <TrueColors> P.S ... I'm deedee
[22:05:37] <TrueColors> oooo what does this button do
[22:05:43] <tmayr> im sure he means the other dexter
[22:05:48] <TrueColors> oh.
[22:05:48] <TrueColors> lol
[22:05:51] <Enginoob> TrueColors: the showtime show
[22:05:52] <Enginoob> Yeah
[22:05:54] <systemfault> Dexter? When is the new season starting?
[22:05:58] <tmayr> not yet
[22:05:59] <TrueColors> I don't knwo of any other dexter :/
[22:06:00] <tmayr> should be soon tho
[22:06:01] <tmayr> i think
[22:06:01] <systemfault> In september I guess :/
[22:06:08] <TrueColors> but I'm out. :P
[22:06:09] <aaairc> so i'm using the jqueryui... and setting the the input checkbox to be a button
[22:06:13] <Enginoob> I just started, so I'm on the season 2 premiere
[22:06:27] <systemfault> aaairc: Doesn't make any sense...
[22:06:29] <aaairc> so in reality there isn't a checkbox that i'm trying to increase in size... just the width of the button that jquery is using as the checkbox
[22:06:36] <systemfault> aaairc: Don't use a checkbox if you want a button
[22:06:41] <Enginoob> tmayr: it get better?
[22:06:57] <aaairc> http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#checkbox
[22:06:58] <tmayr> yeah, its good all the way up to the last ep
[22:07:06] <Enginoob> Not a fan of the last one?
[22:07:33] <aaairc> i'm trying to do that... i thought it would be the easiest way to get the style of the button... but have the functionality of staying depressed once its selected like a checkbox
[22:07:46] <systemfault> aaairc: Have you checked the DOM tree?
[22:07:54] <Sora_> tmayr: de que parte eres wn ?
[22:07:58] <qab> hello, how to make a $_get string from a form with values?
[22:08:00] <tmayr> santiago :D
[22:08:01] <aaairc> i don't know how to do that... still new to this
[22:08:04] <tmayr> tu?
[22:08:06] <systemfault> aaairc: It's not a checkbox, it uses progressive enhancement.
[22:08:07] <Sora_> tambien
[22:08:13] <Sora_> bueno enrealidad soy valdiviano
[22:08:16] <Sora_> pero trabajo en stgo
[22:08:16] <tmayr> o.o
[22:08:23] <tmayr> yo soy de osorno "originalmente"
[22:08:24] <tmayr> jaja
[22:08:27] <Sora_> hahaha
[22:09:08] <aaairc> systemfault: either way do you know how to increase its width after assigning it to be a .button?
[22:09:38] <systemfault> A bit too complicated to explain here..
[22:10:24] <aaairc> i'm not sure its the best solution as i said... the only other thin i could think of is to just use a regular button... so $(<div>).button()... but then i need a way of telling the button to stay pushed down... and when to release... which i didn't know how to do here
[22:11:05] <systemfault> Why don't you use the jqueryui toggle button?
[22:11:19] <aaairc> how do you do that?
[22:11:24] <aaairc> thats what i want to do
[22:12:06] <aaairc> i thought the jqueryui toggle button at least on there example page is implemented by $(<input checkbox/>).button()
[22:12:24] <systemfault> aaairc: He just style the label, not the checkbox itself
[22:12:51] <aaairc> let me try that
[22:13:03] <Sora_> uhm voy a registrar un nick vengo enseguida
[22:14:04] <aaairc> systemfault: great thank you! seems obvious now, but didn't think to sytlize the label. haven't used a label element before now
[22:14:42] <systemfault> aaairc: Ah :) The "for" attribute of a label is what's used to "link" it to something.
[22:15:42] <aaairc> systemfault: ok nice. can a label be "clickable" too? i assume yes.
[22:15:48] <systemfault> That's the idea.
[22:15:52] <tmayr> you can make it clickable, yes
[22:16:00] <aaairc> ok nice thanks
[22:16:30] <systemfault> <label for="lol">Hello</label><input type="checkbox" id="lol">
[22:16:38] <tmayr> systemfault: you need to name the input too
[22:16:45] <tmayr> <input type="checkbox" name="lol"/>
[22:17:03] <systemfault> Thought only the id was needed :/
[22:17:12] <Nolok> this is a no lol zone
[22:17:13] <tmayr> nope, name is what links the two of em
[22:18:01] <Nolok> for links with id, not name
[22:18:05] <systemfault> tmayr: jsfiddle tells me it's really id
[22:18:17] <tmayr> really? :/
[22:18:26] <systemfault> Yeah :/
[22:19:10] <tmayr> seems like it, you're right
[22:19:14] <aaairc> yeah, i'm doing it right now with id... as per the example on the jqueryui site
[22:19:26] <tmayr> yeah, i was wrong, meh :p
[22:19:32] <Nolok> when are you right
[22:19:34] <systemfault> It happens
[22:19:36] <qab> how i get all key value pairs from a form create a get string like ?name=value&name2=value2 etc etc?
[22:19:38] <systemfault> I'm wrong all the time
[22:19:49] <Nolok> serialize
[22:20:16] <qab> hows that work?
[22:20:20] <tmayr> systemfault: never ran into any issues since i use same names for name and id, haha, but i was under the impression that name was the one that linked em :/
[22:20:35] <Nolok> data = $('form').serialize();
[22:21:03] <qab> thanks
[22:21:04] <Nolok> name == form keys, that is all
[22:21:21] <systemfault> tmayr: The problem with that is that more than a single element can have the same name AFAIK
[22:23:06] <tmayr> yeah, sounds logical when you think about it :P
[22:24:41] <tmayr> systemfault: you can also link a label to multiple elements tho
[22:25:52] <tmayr> you can also do <label>label name <input/> </label> and itll be implicitly linked, interesting :P
[22:26:16] <Nolok> example
[22:26:17] <systemfault> Hmm, didn't know.
[22:26:27] <tmayr> thats what im reading in the spec at least
[22:26:31] <tmayr> http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.9.1
[22:26:43] <Nolok> just show eg, cause you didn't make much sense
[22:27:06] <tmayr> look at the link, you have better formatted examples there
[22:27:41] <Nolok> "you can also link a label to multiple elements though"
[22:27:56] <Nolok> makes no sense ... :P
[22:28:16] <tmayr> oh, i dont have an example for that, refering to
[22:28:18] <tmayr> "More than one LABEL may be associated with the same control by creating multiple references via the for attribute"
[22:28:19] <Paveloosha> setting checkbox size is not looking easy..
[22:28:30] <tmayr> :P
[22:28:40] <Paveloosha> or may not possible..
[22:28:56] <tmayr> Paveloosha: you just want a big checkbox?
[22:29:00] <Sora_> uhm imagina 2 campos para telefonos
[22:29:04] <Sora_> o codigo y telefono
[22:29:07] <Nolok> just the opposite
[22:29:09] <Sora_> los pones en el mismo label
[22:29:12] <Paveloosha> yap
[22:29:20] <Nolok> you said 1label:n-elements and that says n-labels:1-element
[22:29:28] <tmayr> oh you're right, i mistead
[22:29:28] <tmayr> ._.
[22:29:32] <tmayr> misread*
[22:29:36] <tmayr> fml.
