[00:01:45] <Engin> hmm json does not allow nan ?
[00:01:59] <Cork> you mean NaN ?
[00:02:44] <chee> he means nuns
[00:02:54] <progrock`> Engin: http://json.org/   search for Nan
[00:02:58] <progrock`> NaN that is
[00:03:15] <progrock`> Engin: that page defines JSON in its entirety
[00:03:51] <Cork> Engin: if yes, then json only accepts javascript natives
[00:04:04] <Cork> so null, string, number, array, and objects
[00:04:07] <Cork> nothing else
[00:04:31] <Engin> very definitive answers :)
[00:06:33] <progrock`> sleep time

[00:19:03] <joshualibrarian> sigh... well, I made a plugin out of it!  still has a remaining bug though!  click right once, wait for it to finish, and hit left twice in a row... http://jsfiddle.net/FpccW/9/
[00:20:55] <joshualibrarian> I tried adding a variable to tell me it was animating, and tried compensating at the ends... still the same behavior.  :(
[00:22:15] <aidan101> Hi I have a wordpress navigation menu I need it to scroll down the viewport as the user scrolls, basically so it is always in view for the user. What method is best for this js? or could I do this with pure css?
[00:22:51] <Cork> aidan101: position:fixed is prob the best solution
[00:22:59] <Cork> depends on what you need
[00:24:33] <aidan101> ok thanks Cork
[00:24:34] <Cork> aidan101: and... please ask in one channel at a time, it makes it less messy
[00:24:47] <aidan101> hehe ok bud sure
[00:24:56] <aidan101> just never know which is active
[00:25:20] <Cork> aidan101: ask in one, wait say 3-4 min then ask in the other
[00:26:07] <Cork> that way you don't end up with two ppl answering the same question at the same time
[00:36:26] <Afflicto> I'm having trouble using replaceWith in JQ. Can anyone spot the issue? http://pastebin.com/QRfD8RXZ thanks :P
[00:36:33] <palm> anybody good with xml manipulation here? :S
[00:40:54] <aidan101> anyone know of a good jquery script that will allow my navigation  menu to float down the viewport with user scrolling, basically what happens on this page when you click "show page contents"

[00:45:27] <Cork> aidan101: http://www.ruturaj.net/auto-sticking-header-with-scroll-jquery
[00:46:11] <aidan101> exactly what I need Cork thankyou!
[00:47:02] <runvnc> Hello.  If anyone can help, I'm having trouble getting my sortables connected.  I can sort my list fine, but it won't let me drop my items into my other lists.  The sortable() connectWith is on line 686 https://gist.github.com/1709495
[00:50:10] <runvnc> this is the html https://gist.github.com/1709521
[00:52:19] <jac0bz1> Morningblues everyone! :)
[00:54:21] <runvnc> hello
[00:54:59] <oal> Is it possible to get all the css rules of a tag/id/class like it's displayed in chrome dev tools/firebug? Something like $('body').css();?
[00:55:37] <astropirate> oal, I think those are manually queried for
[00:56:26] <astropirate> so yah informatino is there, you just have to ask for it.. one at a time
[00:56:45] <oal> astropirate: Ok, will do that
[01:02:48] <Cork> aol: you could try something like getComputedStyle
[01:03:00] <Cork> depends on what you want to do
[01:14:05] <jac0bz1> http://jsbin.com/ojaxul/ <<<-- I'm trying to create a "shift selected row" function.. It works great.. but when i start at the bottom and selecting upwards it misses the last row !?
[01:21:31] <jac0bz1> never mind
[01:21:38] <jac0bz1> was an if/else problem
[01:26:35] <g[r]eek> Hi how do I change the labels of my jquery ui tabs?
[01:27:05] <g[r]eek> I have a button that adds new tabs. I want to be able to specify the tab's label. Thanks
[01:28:54] <vertic4l> anyone got an idea why my .trigger('click') doesnt work ?
[01:28:57] <jac0bz1> Hmmm... There is one problem though.. When shift-selecting I can't de-select.. http://jsbin.com/ojaxul/2/
[01:29:03] <vertic4l> http://www.ntro-design.de/W06
[01:29:29] <jac0bz1> vertic4l: Use console...
[01:29:29] <jac0bz1> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[01:29:32] <vertic4l> i do
[01:29:42] <vertic4l> ya, but i dont get it why it happens
[01:30:04] <vertic4l> problem seems to be this ''+array_3[r][c];
[01:30:12] <vertic4l> but i dont find any better solution
[01:31:44] <vertic4l> changing $('#tbl tr).trigger('click'); to alert(''); fires the alert
[01:31:46] <vertic4l> but not the trigger
[01:32:16] <jac0bz1> use console.log to check what data array_3[r][c] is outputing
[01:32:42] <jac0bz1> my guess is nothing.. because either r or c (or both) is null
[01:33:12] <vertic4l> they cant be null
[01:33:14] <jac0bz1> Dont use var array_3 = array;
[01:33:21] <jac0bz1> use array_3 = []
[01:34:36] <jac0bz1> and one more code issue, you might want to use === when checking if something is NULL
[01:34:39] <jac0bz1> not ==
[01:36:47] <vertic4l> i ve added some of your console.log thoughts
[01:37:33] <dw> hi. does anyone know the name of the scrolling method where a list automatically adjusts scroll position based on mousemove? the scroll position is set relative to the mouse position's distance from top of container. works nicely with dragging, but don't know what it's called
[01:37:53] <nexion> hey guys, is there a function that's a hybrid of .text(...) and .append(...)? basically, I'd like to append some text to a div but have any HTML display as visual HTML, not runnable
[01:38:33] <jac0bz1> nexion: Can you please explain that in an other way or give me an example?
[01:38:46] <runvnc> Is there a way to make jquery rescan/reindex the DOM?  It looks like maybe my connectWith in my sortable is not working because these lists are being created dynamically
[01:38:56] <runvnc> I am calling it after all of the lists are constructed
[01:39:22] <jac0bz1> runvnc: live
[01:39:26] <chee> ,h2h
[01:39:28] <runvnc> but this $.data thing is not working
[01:39:38] <runvnc> How does one use .live with jquery ui .sortable ?
[01:39:38] <Whirl3d> is anyone else having a problem loggin in to jsfiddle.net?
[01:40:20] <vertic4l> i dont get it
[01:40:31] <nexion> jac0bz1, I've got unsanitized HTML coming in via AJAX which I'd like to display in the chat history (a div)
[01:40:56] <jac0bz1> ah!
[01:41:04] <jac0bz1> and you want to keep the existing?
[01:41:11] <vertic4l> ya
[01:41:22] <nexion> jac0bz1, yup
[01:41:26] <jac0bz1> two seconds
[01:41:26] <vertic4l> oh
[01:42:28] <aaronmcadam> anyone know why jshint complains about statements like "a && a.doSomething()"
[01:42:36] <aaronmcadam> it's perfectly valid
[01:42:41] <aaronmcadam> i wonder if it's a coding style thing
[01:43:52] <krz> wtf, isn't $('#runtime_error').show(); supposed to work in ie8?
[01:44:05] <Cork> it is
[01:44:28] <Cork> at least if you used hide() to hide it
[01:44:42] <Whirl3d> runvnc, I think that if you asked about .live during the day, you might get your head bit off. Since jQuery 1.7, the peferred way to handle .live events is using .on...
[01:44:55] <Whirl3d> ?.on@runvnc
[01:44:57] <bot-t> runvnc, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:45:21] <jac0bz1> nexion: http://jsbin.com/amuwuz
[01:45:30] <krz> Cork: what if the element has display:none; on page load
[01:45:34] <runvnc> I'm not using any event handlers
[01:45:37] <jac0bz1> That is a simple method.. but I dont recomend doing that
[01:45:42] <xec> krz: do you get any errors in console? maybe check #('#runtime_error').length to see if you're actually selecting anything
[01:45:47] <Whirl3d> .live is an event handler.
[01:45:56] <krz> xec: using firebug lite for ie?
[01:45:57] <krz> .?
[01:46:07] <krz> it works in firefox and all other browsers
[01:46:09] <xec> or developer tools
[01:46:10] <krz> just not ie8
[01:46:13] <jac0bz1> Better to separate each "chatter" with its on element.. like <p> so that you can add new line after the last </p>
[01:46:20] <jac0bz1> *<p>
[01:46:24] <runvnc> I said I was having trouble with sortable connectWith, someone told me to use .live, I asked how that was applicable to sortable
[01:46:50] <runvnc> sortable is jquery ui, its not a function, it makes a list element sortable
[01:46:59] <jac0bz1> runvnc: I thought you where talking about a jquery plugin for table sortin
[01:47:08] <krz> son of a b**** the javascript has to be placed after the element
[01:47:09] <runvnc> supposedly if you pass the connectWith option it will allow you to drop your list items into the other list
[01:47:15] <Whirl3d> runvnc, I'm familiar with jqueryUI, lol
[01:47:19] <nexion> jac0bz1, I was about to ask about that method :)
[01:47:43] <xec> krz: if you don't have it, i suggest you install developer tools for ie8, it's not nearly as good as firebug or chrome inspector, but does give you a js console and a dom inspector
[01:47:48] <nexion> could I create an element (a span), add a class to it, call .text() on it, and .append it to a div?
[01:48:16] <runvnc> Whirl3d, since you are familiar with jquery ui, do you have any idea why my sortable would allow me to sort inside of my list, but the connectWith seems to be ignored, and so I can't drop my list items into other lists?
[01:48:19] <nexion> or I should instead ask: what would be the jQuery way of doing the above?
[01:48:30] <nexion> that seems the cleanest
[01:48:35] <Cork> $('body').append($('<span/>').addClass('a-class').text('some text'));
[01:48:39] <Cork> :)
[01:48:44] <Whirl3d> ?demo@runvnc
[01:48:44] <bot-t> runvnc, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:48:45] <nexion> sweet
[01:48:46] <nexion> thanks
[01:49:24] <runvnc> http://aalm.willsave.me/index.php/stories#list login: ithkuil@gmail.com password vestige2010  click on stories link at top
[01:49:34] <runvnc> connectWith call is on line 686 of stories.js
[01:49:56] <runvnc> or it was let me check that line number
[01:50:28] <runvnc> thats the right line number
[01:50:51] <runvnc> basically to reproduce, see the stories are sortable, but I need to be able to move them between columns
[01:50:54] <krz> xec: yea ill think of doing that soon. currently running i.e. on a vm
[01:51:26] <runvnc> well they are sortable  on the raw column after 3 seconds
[01:51:37] <runvnc> I was just adding the settimeout because I was desperate
[01:51:41] <runvnc> didnt make any different
[01:51:43] <runvnc> difference
[01:56:15] <Whirl3d> runvnc, I'm not sure where you have setup the droppable interface to drag/drop elements onto the tabs?
[01:56:19] <rikkert> do you redirect or render in the route that triggers the event/
[01:57:48] <runvnc> on line 686 I call sortable with connectWith as per instructions here http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[01:58:27] <runvnc> I am not sure I can get away with dropping onto the headings (if thats what you mean)
[01:59:57] <nexion> if I create an element with $('<div/>'), it doesn't get added to the DOM (unless I explicitly do so) and will be garbage-collected when it gets out of scope, right?
[02:00:09] <Whirl3d> runvnc, try using a class instead of an id
[02:00:58] <runvnc> I was using a class originally
[02:01:04] <runvnc> .stories-list
[02:01:18] <runvnc> I thought, ok, classes aren't working, let me try using ids
[02:02:15] <Whirl3d> I'm just getting database errors now.
[02:02:40] <runvnc> Did you log in?
[02:02:59] <runvnc> It doesn't check on that page yet
[02:03:06] <runvnc> but the database does
[02:03:23] <runvnc> so you need to log in with my email and password
[02:04:12] <runvnc> I wish there were just a way to tell jquery to go over and reindex the whole dom or something
[02:05:49] <runvnc> My guess is that its not working because I added the li s dynamically
[02:05:57] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I logged in and it was working for a minute. Now, no matter what I try, I keep getting ErrorNumber 1054
[02:06:19] <runvnc> did you click on logout
[02:06:25] <Whirl3d> Never got the chance
[02:06:41] <runvnc> try clicking on logout
[02:06:42] <Whirl3d> have you tried using .on?
[02:06:56] <runvnc> How do you use .on with .sortable?
[02:07:50] <Whirl3d> gimme a second, I'm gonna change browsers
[02:09:01] <Whirl3d> okay. I see raw, groomed in progress, and completed
[02:09:20] <Whirl3d> you want to be able to drag "Groomed Test" to "groomed"
[02:10:34] <runvnc> right I want to be able to drag between the columns
[02:10:42] <runvnc> first and second column now have .sortable on
[02:10:51] <runvnc> but it seems to ignore the connectWith option
[02:11:01] <runvnc> which I think is because the li s were added dynamically
[02:11:07] <runvnc> cant think of any other reason
[02:12:39] <runvnc> so every is so quick and happy to mention "just use live" which is for events, not for sortable or anything
[02:13:02] <runvnc> so I am looking at the jquery code, trying to see how it works, so I can make it reindex the DOM
[02:13:02] <hazamonzo> hey folks. I have a selection of checkboxes... i need to register when a checkbox is checked and execute a function (in the end im trying to build an array of checked values.) Should i be looking at the .change jquery function ?
[02:14:43] <Whirl3d> runvnc, what happens if you reinitiailize .sortable after each item is added?
[02:15:19] <gabriel9> good day to all
[02:16:00] <runvnc> sortable runs on the ul selector not on the li selector
[02:16:02] <gabriel9> question: is there any selector/filter to get all relative or absoulute or fixed elements
[02:16:04] <runvnc> but I was waiting 3 seconds
[02:16:08] <runvnc> with a settimeout
[02:16:13] <runvnc> aftger all the lis loaded
[02:16:29] <runvnc> you want me to call it many times
[02:16:55] <Whirl3d> How are you adding them dynamically then?
[02:17:15] <Whirl3d> if you are calling the sortable after all of them are added (dynamically or not), the sortable doesn't know
[02:17:36] <toxz> hi! i have a site with some ajax requests running on site load. if the user clicks a submit button on the page while the requests are running, the error function of the ajax-request is automatically fired... is that the way it should be?
[02:17:56] <runvnc> the story items li are added on line 642
[02:19:30] <Whirl3d> before their parent ul calls the .sortable method, right?
[02:20:32] <runvnc> right
[02:21:48] <Whirl3d> then it's not because they are dynamically created. When the sortable widget initializes the parent ul, if all the li's are there, they get initialized.
[02:22:50] <runvnc> I put the settimeout back on there
[02:23:04] <runvnc> I don't know what other reason there would be
[02:23:20] <runvnc> I tried with the class selector on the sortable and on the connectwith option
[02:23:26] <runvnc> and with ids in both places or one place
[02:23:31] <runvnc> not sure what else is there
[02:23:37] <runvnc> I was tracing through
[02:23:44] <runvnc> there is a connectwith thing in jquery ui
[02:23:59] <runvnc> it tries to find something in a function with a name like $.data
[02:24:04] <runvnc> and it doesnt find it
[02:25:51] <Whirl3d> You can store data in each elements "data" attribute using $("something").data({myDataName:myDataValue});
[02:25:59] <runvnc> ok
[02:26:09] <runvnc> Well this was an internal function I was looking at in the debugger
[02:26:25] <runvnc> where it is doing the connectWith stuff
[02:26:32] <runvnc> and it was calling data(
[02:26:40] <runvnc> to try to find something related to connectwith
[02:26:43] <runvnc> and it wasnt in there
[02:27:11] <shomon> hi, can jquery tell a file's size before upload?
[02:29:28] <Whirl3d> runvnc, try adding a class to both sortable lists called "connectableList" or something.
[02:29:47] <runvnc> They both already have the .stories-list class
[02:29:58] <runvnc> And I tried running sortable on that
[02:30:05] <runvnc> and specified that class in connectWith
[02:30:47] <Whirl3d> then $("#raw-list, #moved-list").sortable({connecctWith:".stories-list"});
[02:31:06] <K3|Chris|Work> what was the jQ "shorthand" for .css({display:'block'}) again? :|
[02:31:44] <Whirl3d> in other words, use the connect with class in both lists to connect them rather than initializing them separately
[02:32:39] <runvnc> that's what I had before
[02:32:42] <runvnc> I will put it back
[02:32:51] <runvnc> maybe with the settimeout it will work
[02:33:08] <Whirl3d> And though I can't say this for sure, I've heard of people having problems with hyphenated class names..Perhaps you could try using CamelCase to test and see if that helps at all?
[02:34:34] <runvnc> ok changing it back to the ids with commas and then the classname didnt work
[02:34:39] <runvnc> thanks for your help btw
[02:34:46] <runvnc> I will try getting rid of the hyphens
[02:38:35] <scratcha> hi, i have 3 selectors,, and i want to do, if($(any-of-my-selectors).val() != ""){} can anyone suggest the pragmatic syntax for doing this ?
[02:39:46] <runvnc> didn't make any difference
[02:39:59] <runvnc> Maybe this will be really easy tomorrow
[02:40:04] <chee> :
[02:40:05] <chee> D
[02:42:11] <iamcurio> is there a reason why the <a href=""> doesn't work with my javascript and only the onclick= does?
[02:42:17] <runvnc> $('sel1, sel2, sel3').each
[02:42:40] <Whirl3d> got it to work, hold on one sec
[02:42:52] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/WWCwP/
[02:43:50] <Whirl3d> but it only lets you drag the elements to the top of the other list
[02:44:00] <runvnc> awesome
[02:44:03] <runvnc> so whats different?
[02:44:09] <runvnc> I tried that already
[02:44:12] <runvnc> the way you wrote it
[02:44:38] <Whirl3d> did you disable selection?
[02:44:52] <runvnc> yes
[02:44:56] <runvnc> the onlyh thing thats different
[02:45:06] <runvnc> is that nothing is added dynamically
[02:45:17] <runvnc> the lis and uls and everything are on there from the beginning
[02:45:39] <Whirl3d> Okay, gimme a second to make it dynamic to show you what I am meaning
[02:47:08] <runvnc> I will put the disableselection back
[02:47:11] <runvnc> wont make any difference
[02:48:04] <Leo__> Hi, i'm completely new to Jquery and already running into the first trouble: downloading and running Jquery. Getting windows scripting host error "window is undefined". Any ideas what i'm doing wrong?
[02:52:00] <iamcurio> or is there a way to change the onclick function in my jaavscript to just use a regular a tag?
[02:52:36] <runvnc> $('#mybtnid').click(function(){alert('clicked it');});
[02:58:12] <runvnc> maybe its because my LIs are the same width as the ul
[02:58:25] <runvnc> which yours are narrower than the container
[03:00:09] <mindis|wurk> gentlemen. i was wondering if there's a way to wrap parentless text with an element? so if i had something like <div>text<p>moretext</p>evenmoretext</div> i'd get <div><p>text</p><p>moretext</p><p>evenmoretext</p></div>
[03:05:26] <phryk> Does anyone have the ipaddr that up to yesterday was associated with fanyapps.com?
[03:06:38] <runvnc> Whirl3d, did you try with dynamic lis?
[03:06:44] * Whirl3d is having problems with jsfiddle
[03:07:04] <MagePsycho> why there is a flickering in scrollbar in IE?
[03:07:18] <runvnc> I appreciate your help.  at least you proved that it is possible with something very similar to what I have
[03:07:25] <runvnc> I tried making the lis narrower didnt help
[03:07:43] <runvnc> so again the only thing that I can see that is different is the way that the lis are being populated after the page loads
[03:08:46] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/WWCwP/5/
[03:09:01] <Whirl3d> or try the same with a 6 on it. Not sure if it saved
[03:10:33] <Whirl3d> So, you add a label, select a list, and click the add button. It clones the first node in the selected list, applys the new label, and then you can add another. Once you have added several to each list, click APPLY and it makes them sortable
[03:10:35] <runvnc> on 5 I can't drag them
[03:10:48] <runvnc> oh i see
[03:10:49] <Whirl3d> even after you click apply
[03:12:02] <Whirl3d> and then, even if I add after applying, they are still draggable and connected
[03:12:07] <AdvoWork> I'm trying to use each to get selected checkboxes in a table: http://jsfiddle.net/LGsVR/ but it keeps erroring on each. ANy ideas please?
[03:13:25] <runvnc> Right so why doesn't mine work
[03:13:28] <runvnc> if you look at view source
[03:13:36] <runvnc> I am calling sortable just the same as you are
[03:13:50] <runvnc> what is different
[03:13:53] <Whirl3d> I think it's because you have too many architectures running at the same time. Must be conflicting somewhere
[03:14:09] <runvnc> ok I will be happy to remove an architecture
[03:14:15] <runvnc> if I can figure out what you mean by that
[03:14:23] <runvnc> what do you mean architecture
[03:14:33] <runvnc> you think backbone is messing it up?
[03:14:39] <hazamonzo> hey folks. any idea why .change would only visually change the status of a checkbox and not the checked attribute

[03:20:17] <Marco-123> hi all. anyone using Dynatree? i can not find how to bind events to when a node is created or removed. this seems elementary but its mentioned no where on google or its docs. any ideas?
[03:20:57] <runvnc> They are definitely sortable
[03:21:02] <runvnc> and I had a log
[03:21:05] <runvnc> but I can sort them fine
[03:21:11] <runvnc> I just cannot drop them into the other columns
[03:21:55] <Whirl3d> Maybe they have to have a common parent or something?
[03:22:51] <runvnc> Its rendering twice
[03:23:11] <runvnc> maybe only calling sortable once
[03:23:13] <runvnc> let me check that
[03:31:56] <Whirl3d> AdvoWork, try using .map
[03:33:24] <runvnc> thanks a lot for demonstrating that it should work
[03:33:31] <runvnc> they do have a common parent
[03:33:38] <runvnc> and now its only rendering once
[03:33:54] <runvnc> anyway thanks again.  can't see whats different in mine but hopefully after sleeping something obvious will show up
[03:34:03] <runvnc> goodnight
[03:34:22] <Whirl3d> sorry we couldn't get it figured out.
[03:34:24] <Whirl3d> Sleep well.

[04:20:48] <Agbeladem> Hi everyone
[04:21:42] <Agbeladem> I'm loading a lot of facebook iframes (like buttons) on my page. And for some reason, they're like still pending and my ajax calls become infinite. What can I do ?
[04:22:32] <stephen> Agbeladem: Your browser is limited on the number of simultaneous connections it can grab content with
[04:22:52] <stephen> 2-3 loading at a time at max
[04:22:53] <Agbeladem> stephen: I forgot to mention: this is only an issue on google chrome
[04:23:05] <stephen> Doesn't matter
[04:23:30] <stephen> Sounds like fast browser is running fast
[04:23:40] <Agbeladem> stephen: well.. then what should I do ?
[04:23:49] <stephen> Mind the load and complete events
[04:24:14] <stephen> if 3 is the limit, make sure only 3 are loading. Wait for a load or complete event before loading th next
[04:24:33] <stephen> or, in this case, wait to create the iframes
[04:24:40] <stephen> or at least wait to set their locations
[04:25:36] <Agbeladem> stephen: let me be more precise. The iframes are loaded at the beginning on the page. My ajax call is made on a on click event. Thus, they are already loading when the ajax call is started.
[04:25:39] <stephen> Once all the frames are up there's a possibility each one will get their own set of 3 threads for XHR calls, but don't quote me on that
[04:26:10] <stephen> So the ajax call is at the same document level as all the iframes?
[04:26:21] <stephen> Yeah, you're gonna run into thread limits there
[04:26:50] <ecthiender> Hello, I'm implementing ajaxError to handle errors for all ajax calls i make in my app. Now if I want to implement a more specific error callback within a $.ajax call, will the error callback defined inside $.ajax will override ajaxError handler?
[04:26:56] <stephen> How many frames are we talking?
[04:27:11] <ecthiender> I hope I'm clear
[04:27:12] <Agbeladem> stephen: they're loading 10 by 10. I'd say 10.
[04:27:38] <Agbeladem> stephen: I mean, there's a view more button (it's a timeline), but by default there will be 10 iframes
[04:28:05] <stephen> Agbeladem: Wait to show your clickable element until all but 2 frames are loaded
[04:28:15] <stephen> That should do you
[04:28:40] <Agbeladem> stephen: that's the thing. On chrome, the iframes are like still virtually loading after 10 minutes
[04:29:19] <stephen> ecthiender: I can help, one sec
[04:29:27] <ecthiender> yeah sure stephen
[04:29:30] <Agbeladem> stephen: I still have he circle turning in my tab. The network tab of the developper console still refers to them as "pending"
[04:29:37] <stephen> Agbeladem: then speed up the load
[04:29:46] <stephen> Yup
[04:29:58] <stephen> You're reaching thread limit
[04:30:13] <stephen> You might be able to toss the XHR call off into a worker
[04:30:39] <Agbeladem> stephen: what do you mean speed up the load^^ the iframes are on facebook
[04:30:46] <stephen> ok, ecthiender
[04:31:05] <stephen> Agbeladem: Use a webworker to do the XHR and it will solve the problem
[04:31:13] <stephen> But implementing it will be more work
[04:31:25] <stephen> ecthiender: ajaxError is an Event Handler
[04:31:43] <ecthiender> stephen, i know there is a 'global' parameter that can be set to false for the global handlers. but the problem is, all the ajax calls are made by backbone.js. so i'm wondering if there's a way to set it to false.
[04:31:44] <stephen> jQuery.ajax().error is a callback
[04:32:00] <ecthiender> okay stephen go on
[04:32:08] <stephen> Basically, the error callback will always get called
[04:32:29] <stephen> and so will ajaxError, and their timing will be unpredictable
[04:32:45] <stephen> you could probably override the error callback to return false or something
[04:32:54] <stephen> Which of the two is causing you greif?
[04:33:07] <ecthiender> the global handler
[04:33:18] <ecthiender> i want to execute the error callback
[04:33:39] <ecthiender> instead of the global handler, in few particular places
[04:34:12] <ecthiender> so according to you the error callback should always get executed overriding the global handler
[04:34:15] <ecthiender> ?
[04:34:19] <ecthiender> stephen, ^
[04:34:33] <stephen> they don't override
[04:34:41] <stephen> both should technically be fired
[04:35:05] <Agbeladem> stephen: why would the iframes be pending on google chrome only though ?
[04:35:18] <stephen> ajaxError should hear the "ajaxError" event
[04:35:40] <stephen> and .error is a deferred which is resolved via callback
[04:35:44] <ecthiender> oh different events get triggered? now i get it :)
[04:35:48] <ecthiender> stephen, ^
[04:36:15] <stephen> Agbeladem: Likely because FB has a bug somewhere which is causing them to never finish loading
[04:36:32] <stephen> Agbeladem: have you tried only loading 1-2 frames and seeing what happened?
[04:36:50] <stephen> ecthiender: 1 event fire and 1 callback
[04:37:01] <stephen> the callback is just like inline code
[04:37:07] <stephen> it calls the function and keeps going
[04:37:17] <ecthiender> stephen, i get it now. the error is a callback, it does not listen to any event. the ajaxError handler listens to ajaxError events
[04:37:22] <stephen> The event fires off like a separate thread and goes about it's own thing
[04:37:30] <Agbeladem> stephen: I like to believe they're never ending loading, however the bug would be on FF as well wouldn't it ? =/
[04:37:33] <stephen> ecthiender: Exactly
[04:37:50] <ecthiender> so how does the ajax() know when to call the error callback?
[04:38:01] <ecthiender> if it gets any error code in response?
[04:38:02] <stephen> Agbeladem: Nah, Webkit and FF are two different beasts
[04:38:29] <Agbeladem> stephen: true that
[04:38:43] <stephen> ecthiender: yup. It chooses which Deferred (success or error) to resolve based on the response
[04:38:47] <Shambat> I have this code: http://bpaste.net/show/22749/ and I want to make it show a loading gif while the data is being fetched ... how can I do this? do I run some show() function and then some hide() function inside the success function?
[04:39:08] <ecthiender> stephen, hmm
[04:39:08] <Cancerus> hot to bind callback to global event? for example, something like $.bind('pew',fn(){}); $.event.trigger('pew')
[04:39:18] <stephen> Shambat: Yes
[04:40:12] <stephen> ecthiender: if you need to stop the ajaxError from being called, why not unbind it and recreate it once the moment has passed?
[04:41:14] <ecthiender> stephen, hmm. is it a tidy way to do it?
[04:41:24] <stephen> ecthiender: If you can deal with the momentary lapse of ajaxError handling, use $("errorDiv").unbind("ajaxError");
[04:41:28] <Shambat> stephen: ok, so perhaps: $('#loading').show(); before the $.ajax() call and $('#loading').hide(); inside the success function?
[04:41:46] <ecthiender> yeah got that stephen .
[04:41:48] <ecthiender> :)
[04:41:54] <stephen> Shambat: I'd put it in the .complete, not success
[04:42:19] <stephen> ecthiender: I wouldn't call that tiday
[04:42:39] <jonkristian> Anyone know of any good examples on how to achieve this? http://www.ikea.com/no/no/catalog/categories/departments/living_room/10661/
[04:42:45] <jonkristian> Hoover the products
[04:42:50] <stephen> ecthiender: A second way to handle it would be to alter the ajaxError handler to filter out the senders which you want to ignore
[04:42:50] <jonkristian> hover*
[04:43:03] <ecthiender> stephen, what if the errorDiv is a backbone model?
[04:43:11] <ecthiender> stephen, that sounds interesting..
[04:43:26] <ecthiender> stephen, where could i look more about it?
[04:44:03] <stephen> ecthiender: http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[04:44:12] <Shambat> ok thanks for the tip stephen
[04:44:24] <stephen> ecthiender: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[04:44:28] <stephen> those are all I got
[04:44:48] <stephen> jonkristian: The hover effect?
[04:45:14] <ecthiender> stephen, i read about ajaxError. how do i filter the senders in the handler?
[04:45:27] <ecthiender> stephen, modify the handler?
[04:45:55] <LSshocked> hi everyone, im trying to make my backgroundPosition animated, i just want it to gently go up and down/left to right randomly, but adding to the original % it keeps resetting, and going from 0% i think.. example: http://jsfiddle.net/hh5Vx/
[04:46:58] <ecthiender> thanks stephen , i think i got it :)
[04:47:24] <jonkristian> stephen: yes, the hover effekt. I was thinking, i have a div inside the main div, set it to height 0 and use animate, but don't know how that will work with position absolute and the height?, since it will need to drop down over the box below.
[04:47:50] <stephen> ecthiender: Look at the jqXHR object sent for some defining property
[04:48:03] <ecthiender> stephen, hmm yeah
[04:48:59] <stephen> jonkristian: It's a relative div with an absolute div placed inside of it. Just animate the inner div from transparent to visible
[04:49:12] <jonkristian> stephen: ok
[04:49:41] <stephen> The inner div can be larger, but you'll need to be sure that the inner div uses "preventDefault" when it's invisible
[04:50:31] <stephen> so that the other elements can receive the click instead of some invisible div hanging aboce it
[04:53:42] <stephen> So, anyone familiar with a custom object which, given a dom element, creates properties on its self to access and subsequently caches all child dom elements?
[04:54:22] <stephen> Even better: only creates and caches some preset filter list of dom elements?
[04:54:28] <stephen> Yeah, I need to go write that
[04:54:52] <stephen> A DOM-Parent smart proxy
[05:02:43] <XeruX> I've got an iframe with src set to a pdf-file.. How can I get the required width of the iframe once it has displayed the PDF file?
[05:04:25] <gregoryLwD> Xerux, I think $('iframe').width() will work on an iframe, but try it and see
[05:04:53] <gregoryLwD> oh, you want the required width, rather than the width it gets made to be
[05:05:07] <standard12> hello
[05:05:10] <gregoryLwD> hmm, that might be tricky I guess
[05:05:14] <gregoryLwD> hello standard12
[05:05:22] <XeruX> gregoryLwD: yeah :/
[05:05:52] <gregoryLwD> do pdf file properties include the width?
[05:05:57] <standard12> I come bearing problem(s) :)
[05:06:07] <XeruX> dunno
[05:06:26] <someprimetime> i'm loading some content into a div through using ajax(), and for some reason, the content within it, which uses bind() isn't working
[05:06:40] <someprimetime> i tried using delegate, or on('click',... but to no avail
[05:06:48] <stephen> XeruX: Unless it's on the same domain, you can;t
[05:07:27] <gregoryLwD> XeruX, if you do width=100%, I guess that fills the html space it has not the space it needs
[05:07:55] <standard12> I'm having an issue where "$(document.body).click(function () {" causes clicking anywhere on the page to activate the function, but if i'm specific e.g "          $("#somediv").click(function () {" i get nothin
[05:08:06] <gregoryLwD> someprimetime, I think I've had problems with that, so I use .live instead of .click
[05:08:25] <stephen> someprimetime: .live or .on should work for yu
[05:08:27] <stephen> you
[05:08:30] <gregoryLwD> someprimetime, I got quite confused with all those sorts of functions being depreciated and introduced

[05:10:20] <stephen> standard12: You've likely got a zindex
[05:10:23] <stephen> problem
[05:10:31] <standard12> oh maybe let me check
[05:10:35] <someprimetime> hmm
[05:11:27] <standard12> obviously its the drop down that im looking at
[05:11:29] <oskarols> I've been racking my brains trying to figure out why this is (as mentioned in the comments) O(n^2): http://stackoverflow.com/a/1134983 -- anyone got any clues?
[05:11:37] <gregoryLwD> does anyone know of a quick example to make a div dragable along one axis? Sort of a scroll bar, but it's not going to move content & I want to avoid using a slider plugin
[05:13:08] <stephen> gregoryLwD: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-axis
[05:13:19] <Shambat> stephen: about my loading gifs ... if I have several divs that fetch content via ajax and I want to have loading animations on all of them and populate them as they appear... what is the best way to do this? do I apply some class to their divs that overruns the CSS of the divs and then remove the class tag once the results come in?
[05:14:48] <gregoryLwD> stephen, I was hoping I could do it without any plugin, but might take a look at that
[05:15:17] <stephen> Shambat: Created the image element inside each of them, position as needed. Create a css class called ".loading image" and make it visible. Then make ".loaded image" and make it invisible
[05:15:30] <stephen> Then just switch the class on the parent div back and forth
[05:15:56] <stephen> gregoryLwD: Are you familiar with rolling your own drag-drop?
[05:16:29] <Shambat> stephen: right ... sounds pretty straight forward :) what is the best way to add/remove classes like that?
[05:17:04] <stephen> All it is is an "onMouseDown" handler combined with an "onMouseMove" handler which grabs the mouse X & Y and moves the element accordingly. To make a verticle? kill the X part
[05:17:11] <gregoryLwD> stephen, I did it ages ago, actually I see now the draggable stuff is included in jquery-ui, so I don't need an aditional plugin
[05:17:19] <stephen> Shambat: .addClass and .removeClass
[05:17:58] <stephen> Shambat: or .toggle()
[05:18:04] <Shambat> stephen: ok thanks
[05:18:28] <stephen> 1 hour in here and I feel like I've done a day's work
[05:18:31] <stephen> yay for me

[05:19:21] <stephen> I'm going to start charging 1 25-property customer object model per answer
[05:19:28] <stephen> lol, I hate writing those things
[05:19:51] <Shambat> :)
[05:20:00] <standard12> im stumped on this one
[05:20:28] <standard12> oh wait i fixed it
[05:20:29] <Shambat> standard12: ask stephen :)
[05:20:29] <standard12> muahah
[05:20:40] <standard12> nope... chuck testa
[05:20:45] <standard12> http://smoothfinancial.co.uk/phase2development/chucktesta.html
[05:20:56] <standard12> drop down works now... not sure why it wasnt working before
[05:21:08] <jonkristian> stephen: any cool ideas for the hover focus, right now it expands over the div below, but the background is the same.
[05:31:26] <iamcurio> how do i copy the a tag and add an onclick with jquery
[05:31:32] <iamcurio> for example if i had this here:
[05:31:33] <iamcurio> <div class="item">
[05:31:33] <iamcurio> 	<a href="http://www.twitter.com"><img class="photo" width="304" height="456" src="temp.jpg" alt=""/></a>
[05:31:33] <iamcurio> </div>
[05:32:52] <jonkristian> meh, I don't understand the logic of .css
[05:33:28] <chee> wat
[05:33:45] <jonkristian> If you apply one styling, it's 'background', '#000' , if you apply more you need to change the syntax to 'background' : '#000', 'color', '#fff'
[05:34:03] <jonkristian> i meant 'color' : '#fff'

[05:37:36] <chee> jonkristian: but there's no reason you can't use a map to set only one property, if it will make you more comfortable
[05:37:52] <chee> jonkristian: .css({'background':'hotpink'}) is perfectly reasonable
[05:37:55] <jonkristian> chee: hm, i tried.
[05:38:13] <Surtido> no, i don't want to set it, i want to have it, in an array, o i can pass it for an ajax post
[05:38:14] <jonkristian> see that's why i noticed it, but i will try again
[05:38:24] <chee> but notice the difference between ({'property':'value'}) and ('property', 'value')
[05:38:39] <jonkristian> ah
[05:38:44] <jonkristian> yeah the {}
[05:39:05] <jonkristian> ok, now i get it
[05:39:07] <chee> jonkristian: yes. object notation!
[05:39:18] <jonkristian> chee: thanks for explaining this to me
[05:41:11] <Surtido> chee: sorry for bother,  it is possible to get all the attr from a set of elements selected?    jQuery('tr[data-type=string]').attr('id)   i want all the id's of the selector result, it is possible?
[05:41:28] <g[r]eek> Hi fellas. I'm using .load(...) and have to pass an array of values to my target ajax script (which is PHP). What format is the best way to pass this data? Thanks
[05:41:43] <snagnever> hey! does someone use netbeans here for javascript?
[05:42:05] <Surtido> g[r]eek: json? you can serialize it with serialize() or serializeArray()
[05:42:53] <g[r]eek> Surtido, would I need to serialise though? Why not just declare it as var myData = {}; and then myData.a = "foo"; myData.b="bar"; etc
[05:44:20] <Surtido> g[r]eek: of course, if you have the data you can format it.
[05:44:31] <g[r]eek> Surtido, ok thanks
[05:45:07] <iamcurio> : how do i copy the a tag of a selector and add an onclick with the link from the a tag? I'm new to jquery
[05:45:09] <chee> Surtido: sorry sir, i didn't notice your question
[05:45:41] <Surtido> chee: ouch, no problem, i asked you because i saw you on the chat, no need to apologize
[05:45:50] <chee> $('tr[data-type=string]').each( function(){ $(this).attr( 'id' ) })
[05:45:58] <chee> that should do what you want, shouldn't it?
[05:46:25] <Surtido> with each, yeah, i have it that way, just wondering if there is a "faster" way, without a "loop"
[05:46:28] <g[r]eek> Surtido, in my target Ajax script, how do I read the sent data?
[05:47:30] <Surtido> g[r]eek: if you send a json array, for example, jquery will send it as variables, $_REQUEST['variable_name']  don't know if its set to $_POST or get
[05:47:53] <g[r]eek> wow really? that's great
[05:48:35] <chee> Surtido: i can't think of another way but of course this is my first day with jQuery
[05:49:18] <g[r]eek> Surtido, omg that works. So simple. So beautiful. Thanks for the assistance.
[05:49:30] <Surtido> g[r]eek: ;) yaw
[05:49:56] <Surtido> chee: your solution is great, just wondering if there is another way :p
[05:50:35] <johnkpaul> what is that code trying to do?
[05:50:47] <johnkpaul> $(this).attr("id") doesn't change any state
[05:50:57] <chee> oh
[05:50:58] <chee> Surtido:
[05:51:22] <chee> $('tr[data-type=string]').map( function(){ return this.id } )
[05:52:02] <chee> would return them in a jq array
[05:52:57] <Surtido> chee: oh! that one will work too, my though was to make it automagically in any way, but you are right, even with an "automagic" jquery must make a loop, so i will use the map one, Thanks a lot
[05:54:04] <johnkpaul> chee: I don't know if it matters, but it's actually a native array, not a jq object array
[05:55:27] <Surtido> johnkpaul: yep, a native array is what i want, i was triying to know if there is a way to take all the 'ids' from a selector result without using any loop, (map or each)
[05:55:59] <johnkpaul> ah ok
[05:58:53] <chee> johnkpaul: it's a jq wrapped array, isn't it?
[05:59:04] <chee> johnkpaul: i thought you had to .get() things that were returned by .map()
[05:59:10] <chee> in order to get a normal array
[05:59:17] <aro> is there a way to prevent jquery from autosorting by key in chrome on JSON responses?
[06:03:00] <johnkpaul> oh, chee, I'm wrong
[06:03:04] <johnkpaul> or, we're both half right
[06:03:04] <johnkpaul> http://jsfiddle.net/pjMKF/1/
[06:03:13] <johnkpaul> It is a jq wrapped array, but you do _not_ need to .get
[06:03:20] <johnkpaul> you can use the normal [] operator
[06:03:45] <chee> interesting !
[06:04:19] <johnkpaul> I had no idea, I always thought that jQuery.map just used Array.prototype.map under the hood
[06:12:04] <XeruX> ok, so.. Screw the iframe, I found out I can just do "<object data='mypdf.pdf'.."> and it works.. Now.. How can I figure out the required width of the content(pdf)?
[06:12:21] <XeruX> has to work @ ipads.
[06:15:23] <lilmikey> hi. I have an issue with tinyscrollbar
[06:15:51] <lilmikey> basically, I am getting: TypeError: undefined is not a function whenever I try to call it
[06:18:45] <woodsae> hey everyone
[06:19:23] <devmikey> Question: What does $("#content").load(location.href+" #content>*",""); do?
[06:20:38] <woodsae> devmikey: i think that would reload an iFrame
[06:20:52] <devmikey> Gotta be an iframe?
[06:21:16] <gregoryLwD> if I have margin:auto, can I use jquery to tell me what the left margin actually is?
[06:21:19] <snagnever> does someone use netbeans as ide?
[06:21:34] <gregoryLwD> hmm, full width - object width /2
[06:22:15] <woodsae> devmikey: i'm not sure, but that's what i've used it for
[06:23:13] <woodsae> i'm trying to make 2 areas the same size, so i'm using area1.height($(area2).height()), but it isn't including the bottom padding of area 2, any thoughts?
[06:23:37] <devmikey> SO #content is the id of the iframe then?
[06:23:42] <johnkpaul> gregoryLwD: yeah, that's right ($(this).parent().outerWidth() - $(this).outerWidth())/2
[06:28:58] <devmikey> Does every jquery error show up in error console (firefox)?
[06:29:46] <johnkpaul> devmikey: no, some are thrown and caught internally to jquery
[06:31:12] <K3|Chris|Work> how would I select all elements fitting a selector with a specific or higher width?
[06:31:15] <devmikey> How do you see those then?
[06:31:36] <XeruX> Is it possible to center a PDF within an <object> element horizontally?
[06:31:39] <kul> lazy load not working when I load content with ajax can any1 help me out with it ?
[06:33:20] <K3|Chris|Work> $("div.class").width() is as far as I've come with this
[06:33:27] <K3|Chris|Work> that returns the width
[06:37:28] <K3|Chris|Work> hello?...
[06:37:57] <K3|Chris|Work> I know I can if it, but does that apply to all elements?
[06:37:59] <xec> K3|Chris|Work: the closest you can do is select on width attribute, if one is set in html. if not you would need to loop through potential elements and check each width manually, i believe
[06:38:26] <K3|Chris|Work> :\
[06:38:42] <xec> if i understand you correctly (select elements that have a given width)
[06:38:54] <K3|Chris|Work> or higher
[06:39:12] <xec> K3|Chris|Work: check out the second answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4243624/jquery-selector-by-width
[06:39:25] <xec> using .filter()
[06:39:43] <_ramo> hi
[06:40:24] <Seubeu> Hi guyz, a quick question about sending data from trigger() to on() => http://pastie.org/3289168
[06:40:43] <_ramo> i'm getting a json string with nearly 100 "data objects" ({ 'name' : "myname", 'id' : 2 }.... ) back and wan to create in a div for every entry a checkbox
[06:40:47] <_ramo> how do i solve that?
[06:41:01] <johnkpaul> Seubeu: what is the question?
[06:41:25] <Seubeu> In line 14 I don't have my data anymore :)
[06:41:34] <Seubeu> or dunno how to use it
[06:41:51] <xec> _ramo: just loop throught the objects and create a div for each? what part are you struggling with?
[06:42:00] <xec> through*
[06:42:04] <johnkpaul> Seubeu: i think that data on line 13, is the event
[06:42:12] <johnkpaul> console.log the arguments
[06:42:14] <johnkpaul> and see where it is
[06:42:20] <johnkpaul> I think that it's either data.data
[06:42:24] <johnkpaul> or it is the second parameter
[06:42:27] <johnkpaul> let me check what trigger does
[06:42:43] <johnkpaul> yeah
[06:42:45] <johnkpaul> it's the second parameter
[06:42:57] <johnkpaul> the first parameter to .on() is the event obejct
[06:43:11] <johnkpaul> the second, third .... are the arguments you pass to trigger after the event name
[06:43:14] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[06:43:56] <_ramo> xec: i'm a little bit confused... i don't know how to parse stuff... i get something like: array(157) {   [0]=>   array(2) {     ["name"]=>     string(13) "Thomas "     ["id"]=>     string(9) "23243536"   }   [1]=>   array(2) {     ["name"]=>     string(17) "Stefan"     ["id"]=>     string(9) "346777"   } back from my php
[06:44:27] <xec> ?jquery.each @ _ramo
[06:44:42] <johnkpaul> _ramo: is that PHP?
[06:44:59] <xec> johnkpaul: looks like a paste from a dump of an array in firebug
[06:45:16] <johnkpaul> oh, right
[06:45:43] <xec> _ramo: try $.each(myData, function(){ console.log(this); });
[06:45:51] <zurchpet> Oh well... 11.10 should work... I'll reinstall that...
[06:45:58] <zurchpet> ups... wrong window...
[06:46:49] <xec> _ramo: does that give you each object?
[06:47:32] <xec> obviously, replace "myData" with your data :P
[06:47:45] <Whirl3d> once the user has input their data into your form and you submit the form to your php script, what is the best way to show the user what was sent? Should I return the contents in a callback from PHP or simulate it in jquery?
[06:48:11] <Seubeu> johnkpaul: ok I got it thank you I should find the solution now :)
[06:48:18] <johnkpaul> np Seubeu
[06:48:41] <Seubeu> in fact console.log much better than alert haha
[06:48:59] <Seubeu> for debugging
[06:49:13] <johnkpaul> :) wait till you get to console.dir and step debugging
[06:49:15] <johnkpaul> you'll love it
[06:49:35] <johnkpaul> and if you're in the mood for it, start with some js unit testing, and you won't even need that as much
[06:51:05] <bartmax> anyone willling to help with regexp? i need to get the last consecutive numbers of a string. Like: 32 fdsaf 3 fdsa 3dfa sdfa 789 99887 should return 99887
[06:52:28] <_ramo> xec: let me check
[06:52:48] <johnkpaul> bartmax: can't just split on space and search backwards matching against \d
[06:52:49] <johnkpaul> ?
[06:53:51] <_ramo> johnkpaul: yes, this is php
[06:54:19] <killer11> if you use crossDomain: can you send an ajax request to another other website simply? or does your browser have to be preset and interfered with to maek crossDomain requests
[06:54:19] <killer11> ?
[06:54:41] <bartmax> johnkpaul: ok
[06:54:44] <johnkpaul> _ramo: ah, that's why the console.log recommendations aren't making sense
[06:54:45] <Hooloovoork> killer11: have a look at jsonp
[06:54:54] <Hooloovoork> it allows cross domain requests
[06:55:25] <Hooloovoork> but the xhr requests are ok with going cross domain
[06:55:25] <johnkpaul> killer11: if you have control of the other website, and depending on your browser support, you can use CORS
[06:55:35] <_ramo> johnkpaul: what do you mean?
[06:55:56] <johnkpaul> _ramo: were you pasting a php var_dump before, or a firebug console.log?
[06:56:11] <johnkpaul> killer11: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/
[06:57:52] <_ramo> johnkpaul: a php var_dump
[06:59:08] <ggarri> hello
[06:59:22] <chee> hallo
[06:59:36] <chee> ggarri: what is up
[06:59:56] <K3|Chris|Work> xec: big thanks, works nicely
[06:59:58] <ggarri> anybody knows how I could create a widget of jquery, and this returns a parameter
[07:00:07] <ggarri> ??
[07:00:25] <xec> yw :)
[07:00:30] <vzlahagen> Hi people.. can i ask a jquery-ui question in this channel? it's about jquery-ui slider
[07:00:44] <xec> vzlahagen: shoot
[07:00:56] <tillMorning> http://pastie.org/3289284
[07:01:04] <vzlahagen> xec: ok let me pastebin the code please.. 30 sec please
[07:01:07] <tillMorning> Why it isn't loading? I see ajax loading image
[07:01:12] <tillMorning> but the web site not loading
[07:01:18] <tillMorning> http://example.com
[07:01:18] <johnkpaul> _ramo: ah, that's the confusion, xec and I were thinking that was in firebug
[07:03:08] <fronix> Why wont my error_box div slide down and wait then fade out -> http://pastebin.com/fz4qhVgv
[07:03:10] <xec> _ramo: are you able to load your data in javascript? show us the code you got so far?
[07:03:15] <Brodingo> tillMorning 1) you need to wrap your stuff in a document ready function, 2) you should cache reused jquery objects, 3) if example.com is a different domain it wont work
[07:03:19] <vzlahagen> xec: dude here it is http://pastebin.com/RGv5gUnx
[07:03:54] <vzlahagen> xec: jquery-ui slider it's not working..it does nothing... no javascript error no jquery error nothing...
[07:03:54] <xec> vzlahagen: i don't use jquery UI myself, just ask your question in channel
[07:04:06] <vzlahagen> xec: ok thank you
[07:04:47] <vzlahagen> People jquery -ui slider it's -not- working for me.. here is the code : http://pastebin.com/RGv5gUnx
[07:04:58] <Brodingo> tillMorning please dont PM, see topic
[07:05:11] <_ramo> xec: not really... i have to look how i can retun json data to my view
[07:07:00] <Putr> hi! How can i call a function defined in one .ready() block from a nother .ready( block)
[07:07:39] <xec> vzlahagen: do you get "test" in console?
[07:08:07] <Brodingo> Putr you should really only have one, but if you put things in a closure you can avoid globals
[07:08:26] <Putr> closure?
[07:08:34] <xec> and, is your html actually <div><div id=""</div>
[07:08:44] <xec> or is that a mispaste, vzlahagen
[07:08:57] <zarex> putr: think you need to define the function outside of th ready and then call it from each .ready()
[07:09:31] <xec> Putr: you can't, it's out of scope.
[07:09:47] <Putr> zarex: (i'm cleaning up some legacy code) the problem is the function depends on number of vars from within that .ready( block
[07:10:00] <Putr> i was hoping to strip JS out of the TPL file... :(
[07:10:11] <vzlahagen> xec: yes i get test in console.and yes it's a mispaste.. original code doesn't have that div id=""
[07:11:42] <vzlahagen> xec: here it's a correct pastebin : http://pastebin.com/hHhPpQT5
[07:13:25] <D3adM3at> Putr: if you create a static function you can call it from any context
[07:13:50] <D3adM3at> Putr: Such as MyStaticObject.foo()
[07:14:12] <Putr> Hmm good idea
[07:14:41] <D3adM3at> Putr: var MyStaticFunc = {foo: function(o) {}};
[07:15:02] <xec> vzlahagen: have you included css for jquery UI ?
[07:15:06] <xec> vzlahagen: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.17/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[07:15:42] <xec> nevermind, i see it
[07:15:59] <xec> just confusing myself. i don't see anything wrong with your code, vzlahagen
[07:15:59] <vzlahagen> xec: ok
[07:16:17] <vzlahagen> xec: yes but it doesnt work.. and i dont get it.
[07:17:34] <xec> vzlahagen: but, you do have jquery mobile included as well
[07:17:42] <xec> vzlahagen: does it work if you remove that?
[07:18:07] <vzlahagen> xec: thanks for your time... i just removed the last js includes (jquery.ui.carousel,corner,etc) and it just worked! ...
[07:18:29] <xec> yeah, i think the jquery mobile conflicts
[07:18:33] <vzlahagen> xec: yes i just tried that and it worked.. it seems it is jquery mobile.. not sure why it destroys the slider... any hints?
[07:18:48] <xec> mobile has its own slider http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/forms/forms-slider.html
[07:19:36] <vzlahagen> xec: dude thank you very much for your help.. believe it or not i've already lost a day figuring this out..
[07:20:25] <xec> vzlahagen: you're welcome :)
[07:20:34] <xec> too bad about the time lost though
[07:21:53] <heshan> can we write a function to trigger when another function loads?
[07:24:53] <johnkpaul> heshan: What do you mean when a function loads?
[07:25:23] <standard12> i non jquery related query
[07:25:39] <standard12> is there a generic web dev channel about?
[07:27:54] <chee> standard12: ask the question anyway, i'm sure if nobody is willing to help they will tell you where to go
[07:28:06] <chee> i mean they will suggest a channel more suited to your needs
[07:28:45] <devmikey> #web
[07:28:50] <devmikey> #javascript
[07:28:51] <D3adM3at> ##javascript?
[07:29:07] <D3adM3at> Actually has two #'s
[07:30:36] <standard12> that was my question :p
[07:30:44] <chee> oh lol
[07:30:58] <chee> well there is #web
[07:31:11] <standard12> kk
[07:31:21] <standard12> thanks!
[07:31:32] <standard12> <- not the most seasoned irc users
[07:31:42] <chee> it's populated by drug addicts and people who don't feed their pets, though
[07:31:48] <chee> i hear
[07:32:31] <D3adM3at> How's that diff than any other channel ;P
[07:32:51] <chee> what are you saying
[07:33:05] <igcewieling1> most people are drug addicts, even if they are only addicted to caffeine, nicotine or alcohol.
[07:33:16] <D3adM3at> Or jquery
[07:33:18] <chee> nonsense!
[07:33:22] <chee> i can stop anytime i want!
[07:33:36] <D3adM3at> Code fiend
[07:33:38] <chee> $(developer).stop()
[07:33:55] <chee> it's easy, i've given up hundreds of times
[07:34:21] <aniasis|karega> when I press enter in a text field on a form it submit the form causing a form refresh
[07:34:26] <aniasis|karega> how can I prevent this.
[07:34:32] <nVee> hey guys, is there a way to use the jQuery dialog() within a $.post() ?
[07:34:34] <aniasis|karega> do I need to bind the submit?
[07:34:40] <D3adM3at> override onSubmit()
[07:34:47] <D3adM3at> and return false
[07:34:50] <nVee> i need the dialog box to open after $.post has return and changed the values of some form elements
[07:35:39] <io__> hi how can i make it so that a function that i call within $(document).ready is called again when i load new content with .load ? http://pastebin.com/TBPM0uXJ
[07:35:52] <nVee> this is the code I use: http://jsfiddle.net/reZdr/
[07:36:50] <nVee> or is there another way of getting the content, change the form values (as per my example) and once the values of the form elements has been modified display the dialog box?
[07:41:43] <lduros> hello $.ajax() for jsonp appends a timestamp to the jsonp callback. My problem is that it prevents the use of the cached json output. Is there a way to remove that parameter and timestamp and only keep the set parameter in the property jsonpCallback:? Thanks
[07:43:04] <lduros> aaah
[07:43:10] <lduros> there's a cache: true option hehehe
[07:43:10] <lduros> :-)
[07:54:00] <elmargol> I'm wondering if I have to use a functions statement on a $.ajax success? I find the }); somehow strange to read
[07:54:42] <elmargol> atm i use a function statement inside a function statement inside a function...
[07:55:58] <NoiseEee> sounds like Inception
[07:56:05] <elmargol> yeah
[07:57:43] <NoiseEee> well if you're using 1.7, you should be using .done rather than success, but certainly you can do something like  xhr.done(functionReference)
[07:58:40] <fronix> anyone have a link to a ajax login that removes the login and shows w/e you want to show after login without updating the entire website
[07:59:16] <NoiseEee> fronix: that's something you would make yourself.
[07:59:39] <NoiseEee> fronix: break it down into basics.  xhr/ajax that upon successful login, changes the DOM
[07:59:39] <fronix> was kinda hoping someone already made it ^^
[07:59:46] <NoiseEee> plenty of resources online about how to do that with jquery
[08:00:45] <elmargol> NoiseEee, thank you about the .done hint
[08:00:58] <jeffsmykil> how do I change the href
[08:01:14] <NoiseEee> elmargol: np!
[08:01:21] <jeffsmykil> of a link?
[08:01:38] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: well, the href is an attribute of a tag, yes?
[08:01:52] <jeffsmykil> wasnt sure if it was an attribute
[08:02:40] <NoiseEee> yep, and set/change it via http://api.jquery.com/attr/

[08:07:02] <lduros> I have json formatted items with dates formatted in date UTC. My question is, what should I use to sort them using the date value, and second, how can I format the date in something more readable to users later --- just curious how everyone does this the best way.

[08:11:17] <_bart> Hi, I have a question about drawing stuff to a canvas: https://gist.github.com/d04c97a5527dc098a3dc
[08:11:34] <_bart> how do I remove what I have drawn instead of clearing it out by drawing a square all over the canvas?
[08:13:18] <elmargol> This can't be the right way to do it? jsonRequest.done(function(data) {dofoo(data);});
[08:13:27] <elmargol> it looks terrible *g*
[08:15:27] <NoiseEee> elmargol: thats why people use line-breaks and things, to make it more readable
[08:17:28] <_bart> I have this beautiful example: http://soulwire.co.uk/data/experiments/primordial-soup/soup.min.js  (http://soulwire.co.uk/data/experiments/primordial-soup/) and I can't find a clear(), or a fillRect() so it's possible without! But how?
[08:17:52] <_bart> All canvas drawing tutorials seem to use clearing by either using clear or fillRect.
[08:19:50] <jeffcapeshop> hi - i want to do stuff to a nested ul  $('ul li ul')  but not any nested ul's below that - i.e. NOT affect   $('ul li ul li ul') - how do i do that? thanks!
[08:19:58] <Slydder> hey all. how can I check what the current page is?
[08:21:45] <darcy1> @jeffcapeshop try $("ul li > ul")
[08:22:53] <jeffsmykil> Noisee how come $("table#MainContent_SummaryGrid a").click(function (event) would work but $("table#MainContent_SummaryGrid tr.even td.first a").click(function (event) wouldnt provided thats the path to the element?
[08:24:36] <jeffcapeshop> @darcy1 doesn't seem to make a difference - if i specify $("ul li > ul.this") it affects only that ul, but $("ul li > ul") also affects uls below..
[08:26:26] <darcy1> @jeffcapeshop put a class on the ul you want to play with and target it that way
[08:26:33] <pifantastic> Slydder: window.location?
[08:27:00] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: unless you've actually classed your tr "even" and td "first", you should be using pseudo-selectors there
[08:27:05] <Slydder> pifantastic: for ex. check if the page ist edit.php or update.php
[08:27:18] <pifantastic> Slydder: window.location
[08:27:29] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: they are to avoid problems with IE 7 and IE 8
[08:27:55] <pifantastic> Slydder: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/Y6vy3/
[08:28:09] <jeffcapeshop> @darcy, thanks - i can't alter the markup unfortunately.
[08:29:43] <jeffsmykil> so give it the class when the page loads jeffcapeshop
[08:31:09] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: then i guess your selector isn't correct, pastebin markup or something.
[08:31:24] <schu> hi there. i'm using prettyphoto in a setup where a user has to click a cover image to display a full gallery of images, but i need to tell prettyphoto to ignore the first image (which is the cover and is significantly smaller) - can anyone help please?
[08:33:45] <jeffcapeshop> @jeffsmykil ah of course! thanks!

[08:38:12] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[08:38:20] <Germanaz0> I'm getting a json.parse error in IE
[08:38:26] <Germanaz0> it says "Unvalid character"
[08:40:23] <DJTrey> i was using a KeyValuePair in C# to get back values and this success function filled my drop down correctly. I changed my KeyValuePair to a Dictionary list and can't get it to populate. I'm getting back values server side, but not client side. https://gist.github.com/4d88544438ee3835c5d6
[08:52:02] <runvnc> It was something in my css!
[08:52:08] <runvnc> now I just have to figure out what
[08:54:29] <doki_pen> I'm trying to use on() with 1.7.1 and it's not triggering the callback for elements created dynamically after the on() call
[08:54:55] <snagnever> hey! how can i get the first child of a element?
[08:56:10] <doki_pen> snagnever: :first-child
[08:56:29] <doki_pen> snagnever: so if you wanted the first child of <p>, it would be $('p:first-child')
[08:56:49] <DJTrey> $("#myid :first-child");
[08:57:23] <snagnever> doki_pen, DJTrey  thanks!
[08:57:26] <NoiseEee> doki_pen: then use  $('commonContainerID').on('click','.classOfThingsThatShouldRunAction',function() {} );
[08:57:50] <doki_pen> NoiseEee: thanks
[08:58:03] <DJTrey> can someone lend a hand with my c# webmethod/jquery issue?
[08:59:08] <DJTrey> I have a C# Dictionary list and can't get it to populate my drop down. I'm getting back values server side, but not client side. https://gist.github.com/4d88544438ee3835c5d6
[09:04:08] <philipmat> hello. I'm looking for a bit of help on a behavior of $(document).ready that I don't quite understand.
[09:05:22] <philipmat> I have a page that contains in the HEAD > SCRIPT: $(document).ready(console.log($('link')) and a LINK (in the head, following the script).
[09:05:28] <runvnc> It was the same problem this guy had http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4551
[09:05:46] <philipmat> that console log produces no output - if i move the LINK before the script, it does show it properly.
[09:06:11] <philipmat> (by no output I mean it produces an empty array: [])
[09:15:38] <Hierofant> hello wonderful people.  I was wondering if there is an "easy" (?) way to reference blocks of html code.  I have a navigation pane that the client constantly is changing the wording on, and I have to manually change it every time across many html files.  is there a way to XREF that data from a single source?
[09:16:21] <moesoapy> Hi Guys, can someone suggest why this is not displaying correctly in Internet Explorer? http://demo.fearlessflyer.com/html/demo/jquery_tabs/

[09:26:29] <Eviltwin> Well that worked
[09:26:39] <Joey|bbl> hi, does anyone know how I can get data from an url and turn that into a var?

[09:28:02] <Joey|bbl> gnarf: what should I do after $.ajax('http://example.com/api.php?test',
[09:28:23] <gnarf> is the url you want on the same domain as the requesting page?
[09:28:59] <Joey|bbl> yes gnarf
[09:28:59] <Compeeler> hey
[09:29:09] <Chopps> Eviltwin ya i know haha, i put it up before reading the docu, ive change it to .ready but it doesnt work either
[09:29:32] <Compeeler> can any1 help with this css problem i have
[09:29:39] <Joey|bbl> Compeeler: use #css
[09:29:40] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Do you understand what events are and what event listeners are?
[09:29:42] <gnarf> Joey|bbl: look at the examples in the api docs first
[09:30:07] <Compeeler> http://pastebin.com/gTnDXg9M              i am trying to make everything relative to the center
[09:30:20] <gnarf> #css is useless imo
[09:30:55] <gnarf> Compeeler: i.e. you want everything "centered" ?
[09:31:02] <mllie> How can I hide a div when clicked outside it?
[09:31:14] <Compeeler> yeah
[09:31:15] <Eviltwin> ?g outside events @ mllie
[09:31:16] <bot-t1> mllie, Ben Alman  jQuery outside events: Why trigger an event on ... - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[09:31:16] <Joey|bbl> gnarf: I don't see anything about setting variables with that
[09:31:51] <Compeeler> like relative to the center
[09:31:52] <Joey|bbl> gnarf: I'd like to get all data from an api and put that in a var, for easy access without having to call the api for every use
[09:31:55] <Slydder> hey all. I have a javascript function that I want to be able to use in my jquery block. how can I do that?
[09:32:05] <gnarf> Joey|bbl: $.ajax("/api.php?test").success(function( data ) { console.log("I got", data); });
[09:32:10] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs @ Slydder
[09:32:10] <bot-t1> Slydder, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[09:32:18] <Chopps> Eviltwin if im not wrong events are triggered by the user when user intercat with the browser, and eventlistener is an action or method thats triggered from an event?
[09:32:24] <Joey|bbl> gnarf: okay, I'll try that
[09:32:36] <Compeeler> do you know how
[09:32:49] <gnarf> Joey|bbl: var request = $.ajax("/api.php?test");    ---- later --- request.done( function( data ) { } );
[09:33:01] <Eviltwin> Chopps: So do you understand why $(".resizeta").on(function() {...}) makes no sense?
[09:33:06] <mllie> Eviltwin: is there another solution?
[09:33:28] <Eviltwin> mllie: Yeah, you implement exactly what that plugin does but not use that plugin
[09:33:30] <Slydder> I have a javascript function called getQueryVariables that returns the value of a Query Variable that I pass it per name. I am needing this function in jquery.
[09:33:34] <Chopps> yes Eviltwin, like i said i made the fiddle before reading the docu
[09:35:12] <smooki> hiya
[09:35:31] <gnarf> mllie: $( document ).on( "click", function( event ) { if ( $(event.target).closest("#somediv").length ) return; // do your stuff here // });
[09:35:41] <Chopps> Eviltwin, i got it, worked using .each
[09:36:01] <Eviltwin> Chopps: So...this had nothing to do with events
[09:36:04] <gnarf> mllie: but like - ben's outside events rules
[09:36:11] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Chopps
[09:36:12] <bot-t1> Chopps, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:37:26] <Joey|bbl> gnarf: doing that still doesn't give me a var I can use anywhere other than within that function
[09:37:43] <Joey|bbl> request.done( function( data ) { return data } )   doesn't work either
[09:38:02] <mllie> gnarf: this does actually not work: jQuery("#contact-info").live("clickoutside", function(event) { ..?
[09:38:13] <Compeeler> can anyone help me center
[09:38:19] <Compeeler> i have an example: http://pastebin.com/gTnDXg9M
[09:38:35] <Joey|bbl> Compeeler: use jsfiddle please
[09:38:55] <Chopps> Compeeler join #css
[09:38:58] <Eviltwin> Compeeler: With CSS?
[09:38:59] <Eviltwin> Use #css
[09:39:11] <Compeeler> yes
[09:39:12] <Compeeler> css
[09:39:20] <Eviltwin> Type /JOIN #css
[09:39:27] <Eviltwin> And talk there
[09:39:37] <Compeeler> ok
[09:39:38] <xckpd7> \JOIN #css
[09:39:48] <gnarf> mllie: live?
[09:39:49] <xckpd7> not working for me
[09:40:01] <gnarf> why not "bind" or better yet "on"
[09:40:02] <Joey|bbl> forward slash xckpd7
[09:40:05] <gnarf> ?on
[09:40:06] <bot-t1> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:40:49] <mllie> gnarf: yes
[09:40:55] <gnarf> Joey|bbl: why not do what you need to do inside the functions?
[09:40:59] <mllie> gnarf: it doesn't execute anything inside..
[09:41:08] <gnarf> ?demo @mllie
[09:41:08] <bot-t1> mllie, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:41:55] <Joey|bbl> gnarf: hm, I guess that works too then
[09:41:59] <Joey|bbl> thanks for helping
[09:42:13] <gnarf> Joey|bbl: so like you have some piece of data your code isn't sure if it has yet or not
[09:42:19] <gnarf> cuz the request   is "asyncronus"
[09:42:36] <gnarf> think of .done( fn ) as a "callback" that gets called whenever the ajax completes
[09:42:46] <Joey|bbl> ah
[09:42:49] <gnarf> if it was already completed, its called immediately
[09:43:32] <gnarf> so if you store "var request" and save it for later - it still only ever makes that request once
[09:43:32] <Joey|bbl> so, $.ajax("/api.php?test").success(function( data ) { /* whole script here */ }  will work just fine, gnarf?
[09:43:36] <mllie> gnarf: because then it doesn't work if the element is created after that js is executed?
[09:43:45] <Joey|bbl> oh okay I see
[09:43:58] <rns> anyone know how I can make the width of this multiple select dropdown shorter?  http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[09:44:11] <Joey|bbl> so first set the var and then request.done( function( data ) { /* whole script here */ }
[09:44:21] <Joey|bbl> thanks
[09:44:49] <gnarf> Joey|bbl: i generally prefer to make functions bigger than a line or two named functions, but sure
[09:45:05] <gnarf> function iGotsData( data ) { }; request.done( iGotsData )
[09:45:32] <Joey|bbl> and between the { } put the code then?
[09:45:47] <gnarf> Joey|bbl: whatever you need "data" for yeah
[09:45:54] <Joey|bbl> okay, thanks
[09:47:16] <gnarf> mllie: so like
[09:47:25] <gnarf> mllie: if thats really a problem...
[09:47:25] <Log1x> im trying to do somewhat dynamic content through jquery, and im trying to replace the header with what they click on..is it possible to do something like $('h1').replaceWith($(this).attr("href")); or something to replace it with the name of the link they click on? (all content will be js, so links dont have .html/.php) -- im learning, so sorry if im doing this the wrong way. ._. and would
[09:47:25] <Log1x> appreciate any advice/help
[09:47:49] <gnarf> mllie: i would suggest a) binding your clickoutside when you create the element instead of using live
[09:47:52] <gnarf> in fact
[09:47:58] <gnarf> i would suggest NEVER using live
[09:48:03] <gnarf> ?on
[09:48:03] <bot-t1> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:48:07] <Eviltwin> I would more than suggest it
[09:48:27] <gnarf> live === $( document ).on( "event", "selector", function ) --- only worse
[09:48:32] <mllie> gnarf: this can be created and removed many times. So bind everytime I create it? with one actually?
[09:48:54] <gnarf> and you are correct
[09:49:03] <gnarf> ben's method for the "outsideevents" wont work with that
[09:50:10] <gnarf> but you could easliy $( document ).on( "click", function( event ) { if ( $( event.target ).closest( "#contact-info" ).length ) return; } )
[09:50:32] <gnarf> mllie: the "return" will only happen if the event.target is - or is inside of #contact-info
[09:50:50] <gnarf> so put anything you want "outside" after the return and you should be fine
[09:51:07] <gnarf> i believe i already gave you that example once
[09:51:27] <Log1x> ._.
[09:51:27] <mllie> gnarf: well, now it works. Thanks :)
[09:51:53] <mllie> gnarf: another problem. How do I get right offset from left side for an element?
[09:52:24] <gnarf> huh?
[09:52:28] <gnarf> ?offset
[09:52:28] <bot-t1> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[09:52:29] <gnarf> ?
[09:53:08] <mllie> gnarf: yes, but that is only left and top
[09:53:25] <gnarf> offset().left + width()?
[09:53:32] <gnarf> ?outerwidth
[09:53:32] <bot-t1> .outerWidth([includeMargin]): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/
[09:53:33] <gnarf> maybe
[09:53:34] <gnarf> ?
[09:54:01] <h0st1le> Anybody know if there is a bug in firefox (linux 64bit) for the $(window).height() function? I logged the values
[09:54:01] <h0st1le> to console on a resize event. And occasionally the value returned is 11px off. Ideas?
[09:55:05] <mllie> gnarf: no. from left side of an element to right side of the browser
[09:56:03] <gnarf> mllie: like do some math using the window's width and the elements left?
[09:57:52] <gnarf> mllie: why do you need that value?
[09:59:17] <mllie> gnarf: so I can set position: fixed; right: ...px;
[09:59:36] <gnarf> mllie: maybe look at UI's .position() utitliy?
[09:59:45] <gnarf> http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[09:59:52] <mllie> gnarf: guess jQuery(window).width() - offset().left would be correct?
[10:00:16] <gnarf> mllie: but yeah
[10:00:19] <gnarf> it prolly works
[10:00:28] <mllie> gnarf: position still just gets left
[10:00:46] <gnarf> mllie: you didn't click on that link did you?
[10:01:09] <gnarf> "Utility script for positioning any widget relative to the window, document, a particular element, or the cursor/mouse."
[10:02:17] <gnarf> $("#something").position({ my: "right top", at: "left top", of: "#target" });
[10:04:20] <mllie> gnarf: my solution worked fine, thanks :)
[10:05:24] <gnarf> mllie: np - just lettin ya know that crazy position() utillity is there - kborchers worked hard to make sure it works too :)
[10:05:43] <mllie> hehe :)
[10:05:49] <kborchers> yeah, jerk :P
[10:14:21] <coachz> hi, can anyone tell me how to make the dialog ok button smaller please ?
[10:15:25] <Cork[home]> coachz: change the css padding?
[10:15:45] <coachz> ok thanks
[10:16:46] <Slydder> so. have a problem with a JQuery function not being executed ( http://paste.debian.net/154193/  ) the first alert in the .getQueryVariable function should fire everytime I click on the checkbox in the form.
[10:17:06] <Cork[home]> coachz: everything about the dialogs are controlled by css, so its just to overide/extend it like you need
[10:17:42] <Slydder> if I remove the lower if statement then all works as it should except on 2 pages instead of the one page like I want. thus the queryvariable check.
[10:17:45] <coachz> cool, thank you
[10:18:57] <Cork[home]> Slydder: why don't you check that before you bind the events instead?
[10:19:24] <Slydder> because the event fires on only 2 pages whereas if I did it your way I would be checking on each page.
[10:19:39] <Slydder> and only maybe on those 2 pages.
[10:20:06] <Cork[home]> Slydder: parsing a string is much much faster then traversing the entire pages dom
[10:20:25] <Cork[home]> if you used delegate it would be another matter, but your not
[10:20:34] <devmikey> does $load() with elements only work with iframes?
[10:21:12] <Cork[home]> devmikey: no, it works with elements that fire load events
[10:21:32] <Cork[home]> like img, object, embed, script, iframe, video, audio...
[10:22:23] <devmikey> I was trying to get $("#Logo").load(location.href+" #Logo>*",""); to force a logo refresh
[10:22:44] <Cork[home]> ah, that load :)
[10:23:13] <Cork[home]> wait location.href + ' #logo>*' ??
[10:23:21] <Cork[home]> that doesn't look correct
[10:23:40] <Cork[home]> load only accepts id's
[10:23:47] <Cork[home]> not selectors
[10:23:56] <devmikey> I'm working with http://api.jquery.com/load/
[10:24:11] <devmikey> Under "Loading Page Fragments"
[10:24:13] <Cork[home]> ya
[10:24:49] <Cork[home]> but the syntax is 'url/file.ext #id'
[10:25:04] <Cork[home]> your not allowed to use css selectors
[10:25:20] <Cork[home]> if you need to do advanced selecting you need to do that your self
[10:25:30] <Slydder> have a problem with a JQuery function not being executed ( http://paste.debian.net/154193/  ) the first alert in the .getQueryVariable function should fire everytime I click on the checkbox in the form.  if I remove the lower if statement then all works as it should except on 2 pages instead of the one page like I want. thus the queryvariable check.
[10:26:09] <devmikey> How about $("#Logo").load(location.href+" #Logo","");
[10:26:25] <devmikey> That's just #id
[10:26:38] <Cork[home]> that works
[10:26:57] <Cork[home]> or $.get(location.href, function(data) { $('#logo').html($(data).find('#logo').children()); });
[10:27:43] <Cork[home]> devmikey: or even better, send it as a fragment from the server, so you don't have to load a complete webpage when its not needed
[10:28:07] <Cork[home]> will speed things up a lot
[10:28:53] <devmikey> Does that set #Logo's .innerHTML = that href?
[10:29:03] <devmikey> or the stuff in that href?
[10:29:19] <devmikey> Cuz #Logo is a <img>
[10:29:27] <Cork[home]> ya it does
[10:29:27] <devmikey> So that wouldn't be right
[10:30:07] <Cork[home]> sounds like you want $.get(location.href, function(data) { $('#logo').replaceWith($(data).find('#logo')); });
[10:30:34] <Cork[home]> though really implement it as a json query or something instead
[10:30:47] <Cork[home]> if all you want is an url >_<
[10:31:01] <devmikey> Well I have a PHP script that spits out an image
[10:31:38] <Cork[home]> ok?
[10:32:01] <coachz> i'm trying this to make button size smaller but no luck     $("#usrmsg .ui-button-text").css("font-size","50%");    $("#mydialog .ui-button-text").css("padding","0");    $("#usrmsg .ui-button-text").css("padding","0");
[10:32:12] <Cork[home]> even less reason to reload a complete webpage to grab an url to a single script file
[10:32:13] <devmikey> So I would replace location.href with that href, right?
[10:32:32] <coachz> the div is  #usrmsg for all three, not #mydialog
[10:33:46] <coachz> ooh got it
[10:34:28] <ShaunR> how can i check if a var is set?  for example data.status i need to first check if it's set
[10:34:35] <Cork[home]> coachz:  $('#usrmsg').dialog('widget').find('.ui-dialog-buttonpane button')
[10:34:48] <coachz> nice
[10:35:07] <Cork[home]> ShaunR: data.status === undefined
[10:35:22] <Cork[home]> or !== for not defined
[10:35:56] <Cork[home]> coachz: though as i said, i recomend doing it in css instead of in js
[10:36:50] <devmikey> Cork[home]: Can location.href be the url of my php script?
[10:36:55] <coachz> i got the css working like this:   $(".ui-widget, .ui-widget button").css("font-size"," 0.5em");
[10:38:14] <Cork[home]> devmikey: i would do this: $('#logo').attr('href', '<url to script>?your-params-if-you-have-any=value&time=' + Date.now());
[10:38:42] <Cork[home]> that last param is to make sure cache isn't used
[10:40:25] <ShaunR> there's no elseif in js right?
[10:40:30] <Cork[home]> nope
[10:40:44] <Cork[home]> if {} else if {} else {}
[10:41:02] <ShaunR> ah, ok so i dont have to add the extra curly
[10:41:32] <devmikey> Cork[home]: I'm trying to avoid the date thing
[10:41:51] <Cork[home]> devmikey: don't you want to update the image?
[10:42:16] <Cork[home]> or do you pick image as a param to the script?
[10:43:07] <Cork[home]> devmikey: if the url to the script (including params) is the same, the browser won't load the file from the server
[10:43:22] <Cork[home]> unless its really old
[10:44:03] <devmikey> Cork[home]: I do want to update the image
[10:44:16] <Cork[home]> then you need to work around the browsers cache
[10:44:32] <Cork[home]> and date stamps is the normal way to do that
[10:44:33] <devmikey> Just trying to find a way to work around it by some other means
[10:44:41] <Cork[home]> there is none
[10:44:59] <devmikey> How can you be so sure?
[10:45:19] <Cork[home]> well you can do it by generating some other form of extra data to add to the url
[10:45:37] <Cork[home]> cause the browsers cache builds on the url
[10:45:43] <devmikey> I'm trying to avoid ?.... altogether
[10:45:47] <Cork[home]> if its the same, use the cache
[10:46:06] <Cork[home]> devmikey: then you would have to use url_rewrite and put in in the url instead
[10:46:37] <Cork[home]> something in the url has to change for the browser to fetch a new copy from the server
[10:47:12] <devmikey> Even if the header says not to cache apparently
[10:47:27] <Cork[home]> browsers don't care
[10:47:31] <Cork[home]> only proxies
[10:48:10] <devmikey> Maybe I should just require better browser behavior
[10:48:22] <Cork[home]> its actually a good behavior
[10:48:23] <devmikey> Is there a way to set your browser to care?
[10:48:37] <Cork[home]> why do you hate params so much?
[10:48:42] <devmikey> Well not if I specifically tell you not to cahce
[10:48:44] <devmikey> cache*
[10:49:08] <Cork[home]> you can give the image low cache time
[10:49:18] <devmikey> I give it zero cache time
[10:49:30] <Cork[home]> i think theres a min it accepts
[10:49:33] <Cork[home]> but not sure there
[10:50:32] <Cork[home]> devmikey: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_Caching_FAQ
[10:50:35] <Cork[home]> read that one
[10:51:31] <Cork[home]> not sure if all browsers handle it like that though
[10:51:54] <devmikey> Let me show you my headers
[10:52:10] <ngharo> whoa we just met
[10:52:18] <Cork[home]> lol
[10:52:21] <devmikey> max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, proxy-revalidate, no-transform
[10:52:23] <devmikey> lol
[10:52:36] <devmikey> must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
[10:52:49] <devmikey> Those are for Cache-Control
[10:52:56] <Cork[home]> if thats all, your missing Expires
[10:53:18] <devmikey> I have Expires set to zero
[10:53:30] <devmikey> and Pragma set to no-cache
[10:54:09] <devmikey> SO maybe my browser has bad settings
[10:55:23] <Cork[home]> devmikey: if the http pachage has the Expires: 0 header, then ya, it should be dropped
[10:55:30] <Cork[home]> if not, then no
[10:56:16] <devmikey> that is in a header in the image I send
[10:56:25] <devmikey> a php header
[10:57:28] <Cork[home]> you have a link?
[10:58:01] <devmikey> I can pastebin
[10:59:19] <moesti> hi, can anyone say me how i can access the respnseText from jqXHR response? which u can see in this picture http://uploadix.de/image/showscreen.png
[10:59:21] <devmikey> http://pastebin.com/dt2CysSW
[11:00:02] <Cork[home]> devmikey: thats only the php code
[11:00:13] <Cork[home]> it doesn't mean thats whats sent to the client
[11:00:19] <Iarfen> Hi
[11:02:14] <Cork[home]> moesti: the jqxhr is returned when you do the ajax call
[11:02:23] <devmikey> You want the link to the pic?
[11:02:23] <Cork[home]> and it has a member that is responceText
[11:02:26] <moesti> i know
[11:02:33] <Cork[home]> devmikey: please
[11:02:49] <moesti> normally i access with response.files ....
[11:03:05] <moesti> this works only for files and originalfiles
[11:03:22] <moesti> the jqXHR response i cant access
[11:03:27] <moesti> i dont know why
[11:03:40] <moesti> maybe because its an object
[11:03:48] <Iarfen> I have this problem: I'm using ajaxStart and ajaxStop for all ajax request I do with jQuery in all my website to display a "loading...." message, but I want that a specific ajax request doesn't display this, how I can do it??
[11:04:07] <Cork[home]> moesti: jqXHR is a wrapper around the browsers native xhr object
[11:04:20] <Cork[home]> and it doesn't expose all of those objects
[11:05:07] <moesti> that means i dont have access over the ajaxresponse?
[11:05:22] <devmikey> how do I find the headers it actually sends?  telnet?
[11:05:34] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ devmikey
[11:05:34] <bot-t1> devmikey, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:07:13] <Cork[home]> moesti: no it only exposes a set number of member varialbes and functions
[11:07:41] <moesti> hmm thats bad
[11:07:44] <Cork[home]> devmikey: looks in the net console of the development tools for your browser
[11:07:57] <moesti> thanks Cork
[11:08:31] <z0ned> how can i get the TEXT of the selected html <select> element?
[11:08:55] <devmikey> I use dom inspector.  Is firebug required
[11:09:12] <z0ned> value is as simple as $("#selectElem").val(), but doing the same for .text() returns ALL text values of the dropdown
[11:09:28] <Eviltwin> devmikey: The slides answer that question pretty clearly
[11:09:49] <Cork[home]> Zogot: $('select option:selected').text()
[11:09:56] <thang> Eviltwin: thanks for the ftj link.
[11:10:09] <Zogot> huh?
[11:10:46] <Cork[home]> text isn't in select, its in one of the option tags inside it
[11:11:17] <Cork[home]> text on select will give you the collected text from all the options
[11:11:50] <Eviltwin> Zogot: Yeah, $("#selectElem").text() wouldn't make sense to return only the text of the selected element
[11:13:53] <Zogot> Referencing wrong person :p
[11:13:56] <Zogot> you mean z0ned :p
[11:14:11] <z0ned> ha
[11:14:14] <z0ned> got it. thanks :)
[11:15:09] <Cork[home]> ah
[11:15:17] <fronix> Ok so i have this code http://pastebin.com/5N0GX4A7 and im trying do so when the user has logged in the div#user_box removes everything in it and replaces it with some new html code
[11:15:18] <Cork[home]> so i did >_>
[11:16:13] <Cork[home]> devmikey: ctrl+k should be able to do it too
[11:16:35] <Cork[home]> just click the http/1.1 part
[11:17:03] <SP33D> hi can some one solv my problem my code works perfekt in Firefox but in chrome and ie not
[11:17:10] <SP33D> but i found no reason for that
[11:17:11] <SP33D> http://demo.dspeed.de/preisroboter/js/rest.js
[11:17:29] <SP33D> this is the code it should load content from a external source
[11:17:57] <SP33D> you can see the result under http://demo.dspeed.de/preisroboter/index-roboter.php
[11:18:59] <z0ned> anyone ever worked with google maps api v3 before? i'm trying to find a way to zoom to fit all markers, while keeping the center of the map at a certain lat/lng or marker
[11:19:21] <Cork[home]> SP33D: uh... your serving php to the browser
[11:19:24] <Cork[home]> that won't work
[11:20:41] <h0st1le> when i first load my page up the resize even sizes all the dom elements in it properly. ie it fits everything to the window, if i manipulate any dom elements the resize event no longer does this. is there some way I can reset it to resizing events it has on startup?
[11:21:46] <zCoder> Any experianced programmers with time on their hands and looking for a job, please PM me.
[11:21:50] <SP33D> Cork i am sending clear text
[11:21:55] <SP33D> the result is only text
[11:22:13] <Zogot> z0ned: if you find a solution, I would also like to know
[11:22:14] <SP33D> you mean i should make it with html syntax?
[11:22:16] <aclockworkpeter> hey guys
[11:22:27] <aclockworkpeter> I'm trying to use the console in chrome developer tools
[11:22:33] <Cork[home]> SP33D: <?php if (strlen($_GET['mehr']) > 1) {	?>  doesn't look like js to me :)
[11:22:39] <aclockworkpeter> but how do I import jQuery so I can test it in there?
[11:22:59] <Cork[home]> SP33D: i mean you need to send that code through a php script first
[11:23:23] <Cork[home]> then send it as text
[11:23:37] <SP33D> ehoz
[11:23:43] <Cork[home]> or rather you need to change the header from .js to .php
[11:23:46] <SP33D> where did you got that line
[11:23:49] <Cork[home]> *ext
[11:24:00] <Cork[home]> SP33D: in your js file
[11:24:05] <Cork[home]> its all over the plage
[11:24:22] <Cork[home]> *place
[11:25:21] <Cork[home]> aclockworkpeter: inject the script in the page head, and you should be set
[11:25:32] <EyePulp> so if I have a bunch of things taking place on an element's .click();  and I want to call the .click() and then whenever the click completes do a .remove() of the same element, can I do a .promise().done() or something?
[11:25:38] <aclockworkpeter> thanks bud
[11:26:50] <Cork[home]> aclockworkpeter: var jq = document.createElement('script'); jq.src = 'url-to-jquery'; document.head[0].appendChild(jq);
[11:27:01] <Cork[home]> gah

[11:29:38] <al3nt3j0> Hi all,
[11:30:20] <al3nt3j0> how can me give a help with slidetoggle?
[11:32:26] <al3nt3j0> i pretend the use of slidetoggle for change between 4 the price of products, for show only one each time and link for order. But I only can put it work with 2, if is more not hide product 1 and show the other 3 products.
[11:32:28] <al3nt3j0> Thanks
[11:37:06] <devmikey> Cork[home]:That looks like it's "web search" in my Firefox

[11:45:37] <devmikey> Cork[home]:And yes it does appear to send the headers
[11:50:24] <al3nt3j0> no one with 5 minutes for check what can be on my code? :)
[11:50:41] <al3nt3j0> *wrong
[11:52:03] <NoiseEee> al3nt3j0: what code?!
[11:52:35] <al3nt3j0> how can I show code to you?
[11:52:44] <al3nt3j0> can you take a look on my website?
[11:52:53] <al3nt3j0> if yes I pm you, if is ok
[11:53:09] <NoiseEee> al3nt3j0: no, you can reproduce your problem on jsfiddle.net and then paste the link here, someone will likely take a look
[11:53:45] <al3nt3j0> I have try add the jquer/js on jsfiddle but for some reason it seems not work

[11:54:24] <al3nt3j0> alright
[11:56:10] <neerq> Hi, i have a problem. I have a horizontal list (display: inline), and i want to put it some items, and fade them in one by one...
[11:56:43] <neerq> but when i do fadein, it changes display to list-item instead of inline
[11:57:01] <neerq> is there a way to make it fade in to inline?
[11:58:00] <jabr> Is it possible with HTML5 and javascript to handle dynamic routes like domain.tld/<category>/<id> where /<category>/<id> isn't a actual file path?
[12:01:33] <nsfmc> jabr, you can probably have your webserver route all reqs internally to the same page and then use backbone or what have you to deal with the path and route accordingly
[12:04:21] <self-destruct> hello all, i have a quick question.... i'm attempting to load photos into a lightbox style gallery from a remote URL, is this possible?
[12:04:56] <ShaunR> if(data.status === undefined) { alert('nothing set'); } else { alert(data.message) } i keep getting an alert of undefined, anybody know why?
[12:05:29] <NoiseEee> because data.message is undefined?
[12:05:38] <jabr> nsfmc, ok. Thanks. I'm actually trying to use these pretty URLs with jQuery Mobile + jQuery Mobile Router where I have several HTML-files. Thought I'd manage to handle the requests myself with the help of jQuery Mobile Router
[12:05:49] <ShaunR> so is data.status
[12:06:06] <jabr> ShaunR: is data undefined?
[12:06:46] <ShaunR> jabr: data is set from ajax({ complete: function(data) {} });
[12:06:47] <NoiseEee> ShaunR: if(typeof data.status=='undefined')
[12:07:48] <James13433> best lightweight jquery slider? with ability to clicks 1 2 3 4?
[12:11:17] <_zoggy_> is there an elegant way of doing multiple tabs on the same page, using a class?
[12:11:48] <_dave_h_d> hi all, the function focus() is not working on text areas appended to the body, is there a way of making this work?
[12:12:00] <FernandoLujan> _zoggy_ bxSlider
[12:12:21] <FernandoLujan> really simple lightweight and barebones
[12:12:31] <al3nt3j0> how can I past code from jquery on jsfiddle? my start with function changepricing(), work on browser but at jsfiddle no :s
[12:12:42] <al3nt3j0> from my file to...
[12:12:57] <_zoggy_> FernandoLujan, i need to do tabs.. not sliders?
[12:13:20] <FernandoLujan> oops, I meant James13433: bxslider
[12:13:33] <FernandoLujan> both you guys' users had the same color on my chat and I got confused xD
[12:13:40] <devmikey> Cork[home]: ETags baby, yeah!
[12:14:31] <FernandoLujan> _zoggy_ you going to write your own tabs script or do you want an existing lib?
[12:15:09] <ShaunR> alert(typeof data.status); is returning number?
[12:15:57] <FernandoLujan> al3nt3jo: Link to the jsfiddle code?
[12:16:10] <_zoggy_> FernandoLujan, figure i'd just use something existing. i have several divs, and inside each div i need to show 2 forms of output.. figure i'd just put that in a tab.. but i have to do this like 40 times...
[12:17:03] <FernandoLujan> I see
[12:17:17] <FernandoLujan> Actually, bxslider would work just fine for that I would think
[12:17:27] <FernandoLujan> you can change the output from numbered pagination to titled
[12:18:12] <FernandoLujan> and you'd use the pagination as tabs
[12:18:18] <FernandoLujan> use each div as a different slide
[12:18:27] <FernandoLujan> and each slide can be a tab
[12:19:18] <FernandoLujan> but I'm sure you can find something made specifically for tabs on google xD I can't think of anything of the top of the brain
[12:22:24] <FernandoLujan> here's one better: http://christianyates.com/blog/semantic-tabs/semantic-tabs-jquery

[12:25:34] <delfis> it gives me alert, but GET is not working(firebug is not showing this get)
[12:26:10] <neerq> I have some fadeIn's placed in a loop... but i want to have some delay in between them.. is that possible? The objects who are fading in are different each time, so i can't use .delay()
[12:36:47] <neerq> This appears very hard to do
[12:36:58] <neerq> I'll post an example, maybe someone knows how to do this
[12:37:53] <ShaunR> is there anyway to duplicate what confirm does, stop the code running until i tell it to start
[12:40:01] <neerq> http://pastebin.com/JS2MWw3V this is my code
[12:40:46] <neerq> when i do setTimeout in the loop, it just delays all the numbers, the numbers then fade in at the same time... it should have a little time in between instead..

[12:56:40] <neerq> http://jsfiddle.net/RSwW3/1/

[12:56:56] <dabear> that's different from the first time
[12:57:08] <SP33D> and there is no compatiblity issu i think with jquery load method and the browsers
[12:57:21] <SP33D> it shouldn't matter and the code is right else firefox wouldn't display
[12:57:41] <neerq> dabear, it is, because i fixed the error JSLint was complaining about..
[12:58:13] <neerq> ah wait
[12:58:15] <dabear> neerq: protip: jslint doesn't fix all your errors

[13:15:41] <SP33D> but not in any other browser
[13:15:49] <supsup> seems to work in IE to me
[13:16:01] <SP33D> in chrome it 100% don't works

[13:24:27] <neataroni> anyone here familiar with datatables library for jquery?
[13:25:20] * alaing wonders where yayquery has gone
[13:32:56] <Cancerus> how to get page headers?
[13:40:26] <Cancerus1> how get access to content-language header via jquery, anybody knows?
[13:42:16] <supsup> what version of jquery u use
[13:42:30] <supsup> think for ajax requests u can use getResponseHeader but only after 1.5
[13:46:14] <Cancerus1> not ajax, i need to parse content-language from document loaded
[13:46:31] <Cancerus1> qu 1.7
[13:47:41] <chee> Cancerus1: are you talking http-equiv or the HTTP response?
[13:47:53] <Cancerus1> header only
[13:48:45] <chee> i'm afraid that doesn't completely satisfy me as an answer. but of course this is my first day using jquery
[13:48:48] <supsup> so your loading a document you made, yet you don't know the content-language  - sorry i prob just dont' get what your trying to do
[13:49:21] <chee> Cancerus1: both of those things could be called headers, really. are you talking
[13:49:30] <chee> <meta http-equiv="content-language" content="en">
[13:49:31] <chee> or
[13:49:43] <chee> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[13:49:43] <chee> Content-Language: en
[13:49:51] <Cancerus1> imaybe it possible with native js methods?
[13:50:11] <Cancerus1> Content-Language: en
[13:50:33] <Cancerus1> meta it is tag, but not header...
[13:51:20] <chee> then you aren't *really* going to have any luck because it's not javascript's business. the best thing you can really do in that case
[13:51:35] <chee> is to make an ajax request to the page you are already on
[13:51:59] <chee> and parse the response with the getResponseHeader supsup mentioned
[13:52:55] <Cancerus1> looks ugly  too bad if it impossible, then i'll make ticket to add meta tag
[13:54:38] <chee> Cancerus1: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4881836
[13:56:07] <chee> it's not really javascript's business what the http response was, you see
[14:10:06] <Engin> can't see a method to swap elements ?
[14:10:14] <Engin> the order in the DOM tree matters and I need to swap two elements
[14:10:47] <Engin> i need to abuse insertBefore like stuff i guess
[14:11:33] <al3nt3j0> guys any can give a help? http://jsfiddle.net/F5fEu/ the pretend is change from 1 mounth to 6, from 6 to 1 year from  1 year to 2 year. please :)
[14:20:37] <supsup> al3nt3j0 i give u idea here:
[14:20:37] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/F5fEu/1/
[14:20:47] <supsup> u should make classes tho so don't have so many toggle slides
[14:21:16] <savid> How would write a selector that selects all elements with a non-empty value in a certain attribute?   For example, all elements whose "re" attr is not empty.
[14:21:21] <savid> *rel
[14:21:49] <someprimetime> why won't this work in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/xwwc3/
[14:21:59] <someprimetime> does IE not support array indexing of objects?
[14:22:06] <someprimetime> IE8, that is
[14:22:20] <supsup> hard to say since there is no context to your fiddle.
[14:22:21] <savid> oh nm, figured it out
[14:22:44] <someprimetime> supsup: http://jsfiddle.net/xwwc3/1/
[14:22:50] <someprimetime> i narrowed it down to that block
[14:23:00] <someprimetime> before i was using is() which didn't work in query < 1.7
[14:23:03] <someprimetime> jquery*
[14:23:09] <fronix> I have a problem when i run my login form with ajax it then edits html $("div").html(data.user); but then i have the same ajax form but for the logout though i cannot run that after i just logged in, i need to refresh the page. How can i make them both usable after one of them have been used?
[14:23:19] <al3nt3j0> savid I have see now. I will try :) Thanks alot
[14:23:19] <someprimetime> so i decided to compare this (which is the current object) to the first one
[14:23:30] <someprimetime> by using it's index of [0]
[14:25:29] <levifig> back
[14:25:39] <supsup> sorry i don't know how this is used can you make html example perhaps it's just over my head ;-0
[14:30:21] <waffle_> hey, I'm kinda a newb to jQuery but was wondering if someone here knows of a more efficient way of writing this:  http://jsfiddle.net/w9r7L/16/
[14:31:00] <waffle_> Im trying to add left and right keyup events, but not sure if I'm doing this right or if I need to use .trigger()
[14:33:12] <supsup> no reason to have function around keydown and then call that function since it's onload already
[14:35:11] <MercuryTW> hi I'm having some trouble with jQuery's .getScript()
[14:35:18] <ChrisPitzer> question: $(my file input field).val() // outputs "file.jpg"
[14:35:22] <ChrisPitzer> ^ that happens on a single file upload field...
[14:35:27] <ChrisPitzer> but on a multiple file upload field, if i select "file.jpg" and "another_file.jpg" i get the same output.
[14:35:36] <ChrisPitzer> ie, only "file.jpg"  Thoughts?
[14:35:56] <ChrisPitzer> i'd love to see how many files the user has selected.
[14:35:58] <K3|Chris> cookies are crunchy
[14:36:12] <supsup> chris what is length?
[14:36:22] <supsup> $(my file input field).length ?
[14:36:24] <supsup> = what
[14:36:29] <ChrisPitzer> supsup: checking...
[14:36:30] <supsup> if 2 maybe u can access like array
[14:36:41] <supsup> $(my file input field)[0].val() etc
[14:36:56] <ChrisPitzer> 1
[14:37:17] <supsup> maybe check out the value in debugger.
[14:37:41] <nsfmc> if i'm using jquery ui mouse goodness, does that also have the same sort of touch abstractions that $.mobile.vmouse has?
[14:37:45] <supsup> you sure the selector matches both files?
[14:38:12] <ChrisPitzer> supsup: i'm looking in the debugger now.
[14:38:30] <ChrisPitzer> $(this) is my file input field. I'm in the "change" event.
[14:38:57] <ChrisPitzer> and $(this).val() is the first file i selected.
[14:39:06] <ChrisPitzer> i'm in firefox, if that matters.
[14:39:09] <supsup> i mean how does your multiple file upload work?
[14:39:14] <supsup> there is actually more than one input no?
[14:39:35] <ChrisPitzer> the form has more than one input, but only one file input.
[14:39:42] <ChrisPitzer> but that one file input is a multiple.
[14:40:16] <ChrisPitzer> ie... <input name="images" type="file" multiple="multiple"></input>
[14:40:31] <ChrisPitzer> the "multiple" attribute lets you select multiple files.
[14:40:51] <ChrisPitzer> and the form's post will post multiple files under that field name.
[14:41:23] <ChrisPitzer> i think it posts the same as if there were n fields all with the name "images", where n is the number of images you selected.
[14:41:39] <supsup> k
[14:41:43] <supsup> going to try
[14:42:09] <MercuryTW> I have a javascript that loads another javascript using $.getScript(...). My web console throws a syntax error on line 1 of the callee script, which is "(funtion($){"  any idea what's going on? Firefox/jQuery1.7.1
[14:44:16] <chee> coldhead:
[14:44:25] <ChrisPitzer> supsup: see what i'm talking about?
[14:44:39] <MercuryTW> is it not possible to load one javascript from another for security reasons?
[14:45:25] <dw> MercuryTW: what are you trying to do?
[14:45:44] <ChrisPitzer> MercuryTW: i'm not familiar with getScript but requirejs loads js from js as it's primary function... so it's possible.
[14:45:45] <supsup> sorry got distracted going to try to make an example on jsfiddle
[14:46:29] <MercuryTW> I'm going to be using a javascript-based 3D library in my site, and I don't want to reload it as i traverse my app
[14:47:03] <MercuryTW> so I've got a "master" script that initializes the library, and calls different "screens" by loading them as javascripts
[14:48:18] <supsup> Chris so your using html5 for this?
[14:48:26] <ChrisPitzer> supsup: yeah.
[14:48:37] <ChrisPitzer> supsup: i'll confirm my doctype quick though...
[14:49:33] <MercuryTW> dw: so each "screen" populates the html, when changing screens, the html would depopulate, and a new .js would be loaded reflecting a different screen, etc
[14:49:53] <ChrisPitzer> supsup: my doctype was xhtml-something-crappy, but i changed it to html5 standard... same problem.
[14:50:16] <supsup> you do know that it won't work in non-html5 browsers right
[14:50:25] <ChrisPitzer> supsup: oh, sure.
[14:50:34] <ChrisPitzer> but that's fine.
[14:50:38] <supsup> heh ok i did not know -- not big into html5
[14:50:50] <ChrisPitzer> the problem is that when it does work, i still can't tell it's working form js.
[14:51:39] <ChrisPitzer> ie, when the browser does support it and the user selects two images, i still just see "one.jpg".
[14:51:45] <ChrisPitzer> the post works though.
[14:51:52] <ChrisPitzer> it's just that js inspection is broken.
[14:52:37] <ChrisPitzer> i mean... i can get around this if it's just broken... people just won't see throbbers while their files upload... that just seems wrong to me though.
[14:52:53] <FernandoLujan> use the source luke
[14:52:56] <ChrisPitzer> it's more of a "Right Way (tm)" issue than a "Broken" issue.
[14:53:50] <supsup> yah i don't know researching how to upload multiple files in Html5
[14:54:44] <alexr2> anyone know a good plugin that is visually appealing for changin numeric values... ie: change 10->20 and make it look good?
[14:55:55] <ChrisPitzer> supsup: no worries. thanks for the help.
[14:56:16] <ChrisPitzer> i'm reading up on the "html 5 files api" and it looks promising.
[15:04:25] <coldhead> good times
[15:06:03] <MercuryTW> any ideas about my .getScript() issue? Last post.
[15:09:31] <_ramo> hi
[15:10:52] <ngharo> MercuryTW: try not using getscript; you probably have a syntax error inside
[15:12:15] <ngharo> MercuryTW: getscript is kind of crummy especially if you're needing meaningful error messages.
[15:12:34] <ngharo> MercuryTW: I recommend writing a method to insert a <script> tag into your document
[15:12:42] <_ramo> from my backend i get a json string returned that looks like that: http://privatepaste.com/a90270262e/asfsafd   how can i parse it with jquery so that i get always the name and the id for each data
[15:13:34] <ngharo> MercuryTW: or using a js loader like yepnope.js
[15:14:07] <ngharo> _ramo: fix your backend
[15:14:15] <_ramo> ngharo: why?
[15:14:18] <_ramo> what do i need?
[15:14:33] <ngharo> _ramo: don't encode entities, like quotes
[15:15:58] <MercuryTW> back from cigarette, sorry for dely
[15:17:43] <pYr0x> hi guys.... if i have something like that: var request = $.ajax({....}) how can i get access to the responseText
[15:17:57] <MercuryTW> I removed everything down to function definitions, and it's still no good, but I'll try removing the scriptloader call
[15:18:04] <MercuryTW> *getScript
[15:18:09] <ngharo> pYr0x: inside the callback, see ?.ajax
[15:18:09] <bot-t> pYr0x, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:18:30] <pYr0x> without a callback
[15:18:42] <ngharo> so you're setting async: false?
[15:18:57] <pYr0x> i will learn javascriptmvc
[15:19:17] <pYr0x> so i used the model function
[15:19:19] <pYr0x> var response = this.findAll();
[15:19:21] <coldhead> Cork: you sicken me
[15:20:17] <pYr0x> but the response is a jqXHR
[15:20:24] <pYr0x> request
[15:20:40] <_ramo> ngharo: http://privatepaste.com/a554cec020/asfsafd fixed this... so how to get name and id in a each for every name and id ?
[15:20:58] <pYr0x> so i tried response.responseText
[15:21:01] <pYr0x> but no way
[15:21:14] <ngharo> pYr0x: ok, but asyncronous programming does not work that way.  see ?ajax101
[15:21:14] <bot-t> pYr0x, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[15:21:33] <nFFF> Hombres: I have a variable that contains a bunch of HTML, I want to add a class to each element
[15:21:55] <nFFF> Say the variable is transportHTML
[15:21:55] <ngharo> _ramo: ok whats your jquery look like?
[15:22:39] <nFFF> Actually its a JS object transport.html
[15:23:00] <_ramo> ngharo: http://privatepaste.com/80a05f3b02/asfsafd where "fb" is the json string i shown above
[15:24:09] <nFFF> jQuery(transport.html).find('.').each(){ jQuery(this).addClass('everyelement'); }); <----
[15:24:17] <MercuryTW> bah I am adding the <script> tag, and it's still not working
[15:24:19] <pYr0x> ngharo: so i must use the model class to modifier the html
[15:24:22] <nFFF> Would that add a class to every element?
[15:24:23] <pYr0x> ?
[15:24:32] <MercuryTW> and all the script contains is empty functions! http://pastebin.com/8tYMP7QE rage.
[15:24:51] <pYr0x> ngharo: do you used javascriptmvc
[15:25:41] <ngharo> no
[15:25:49] <pYr0x> ok
[15:26:12] <andrew9183> any one know how i can disable the sortable here?
[15:26:13] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/gcTsB/
[15:26:21] <ngharo> _ramo: that's a bit confusing but you if you $.getJSON('URL_TO_JSON_SERVICE', function(data) { // DO STUFF HERE });
[15:27:00] <ngharo> you can loop over data, data[i].name, data[i].id, etc...
[15:27:32] <nFFF> Anyone?
[15:28:23] <ngharo> nFFF: find('.') ?
[15:28:34] <nFFF> Yea every element that has a class
[15:28:41] <nFFF> I think maybe
[15:28:44] <ngharo> oh, dunno if that'd work
[15:29:24] <ngharo> find('[class]') might work
[15:29:50] <nFFF> ngharo, basically need to iterate over eahc element in a object, and add a class to each element
[15:30:02] <nFFF> transport.text is the object that returns the html
[15:30:07] <nFFF> howd I go about this
[15:30:08] <ngharo> find('*') would grab everything
[15:30:23] <ngharo> find('*').addClass('foo')
[15:30:39] <nFFF> Ok and how to do this to the object
[15:30:45] <nFFF> This would add to the DOM
[15:30:53] <nFFF> not the specific object
[15:31:30] <nFFF> jQuery.find(transport.text, '*').addClass('foo'); ?
[15:31:57] <ngharo> jQuery(transport.html).find('*').addClass('foo')
[15:34:18] <nFFF> Doesn't work
[15:34:34] <joshualibrarian> WHY doesn't the box toggle from blue to red when you click on it?  http://jsfiddle.net/k49UA/12/
[15:36:42] <ngharo> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/FtrwG/ looks like find is not needed
[15:37:27] <someprimetime> how can i scroll to a specific div?
[15:37:43] <someprimetime> kind of like if i did document.location = currentUrl + $('#dom-id')?

[15:40:20] <joshualibrarian> ngharo:  AHHHHH!  thank you so much!
[15:40:21] <ngharo> you needed to prevent the default <a> click from happening, and also had your style incorrect
[15:40:23] <joshualibrarian> preventDefault!
[15:40:36] <nFFF> ngharo, not working either,
[15:40:36] <ngharo> .box .on != .box.on
[15:40:41] <joshualibrarian> oooh... they go together with no space.
[15:41:00] * joshualibrarian is so thankful of this channel.
[15:41:11] <nFFF> onSuccess: function(transport){ var response = transport.responseText; jQuery(response).addClass('foo');
[15:41:17] <nFFF> This is an ajax request
[15:41:22] <\monster\> <div class="foo"> <div class="moo">Hello</div> World</div>   // what would be the fastest way to grab the text string "World"  ..I could remove the moo div from foo and then do .text() ..but is there a way with less steps?
[15:41:27] <nFFF> transport is the response
[15:41:39] <ngharo> nFFF: you'd need to do it on responseText, assuming that's HTML
[15:41:57] <nFFF> transport is an object
[15:42:08] <nFFF> transport.responseText is the html
[15:42:13] <ngharo> yes
[15:42:28] <ngharo> $(xhr_object) does nothing afaik
[15:42:39] <nFFF> Yea thought as much
[15:42:55] <ngharo> $(xhr_object.responseText) if HTML, should work
[15:43:16] <nFFF> Check the code
[15:43:28] <nFFF> var response = transport.responseText; jQuery(response).addClass('foo');
[15:43:35] <nFFF> response isn't an obect
[15:43:37] <andrew9183> $(".foo:not('.moo')") ?
[15:43:45] <nFFF> its a variable containing the HTML
[15:44:06] <nFFF> perhspa $.each(response, function() { jQuery(this).addClass('foo'); });
[15:44:07] <ngharo> oh, sorry
[15:44:13] <jac0bz1> Is there a way to detect single click? I want to do diffrent things on click and dblclick...
[15:45:18] <nFFF> nope that doesn't work either
[15:45:35] <ngharo> ?dblclick @ jac0bz1
[15:45:35] <bot-t> jac0bz1, .dblclick(handler): Bind an event handler to the "dblclick" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/
[15:46:19] <jac0bz1> ngharo: well, when i have an event for "click" that will also get executed
[15:47:11] <ngharo> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/FtrwG/1/ i dunno man, this works on jsfiddle
[15:48:49] <ngharo> jac0bz1: check out the first comment on the api doc page

[15:51:17] <NivenHuH> if i do this manually in the javascript console, it works.. but it doesn't work when i run the code
[15:51:33] <Es0teric> how do i convert a <b> tag into a text input once the user clicks the <b> tag?
[15:52:06] <NivenHuH> oh you know what.. i probably need to do a timeout

[15:53:18] <nFFF> thanks for your help
[15:53:58] <NivenHuH> yea a timeout did it

[15:56:52] <z0ned> anyone know of a plugin that will take a string of numbers, and re-format it as a phone number? if 9 or 10 digits, US styling ie # (###)-###-####   or if > 9, format in some readable format for international numbers (whatever the standard formatting for that would be..) ?
[15:57:14] <nik_jv> halol .. i have a bunch of menus which open/close on toggle event and i need a way to close all the panels also when i click any where outside on the page ...
[15:57:59] <ngharo> z0ned: try the googles
[15:58:13] <z0ned> ngharo, can't find anything that works for both US/intl

[15:59:07] <Es0teric> ngharo, i had something like that but i dont know how to remove it after the mouse moves off the text box

[16:01:59] <ProLoser|Work> when working with <select multiple> where/how are the selected options stored?
[16:02:09] <indspenceable> Hey, i'm adding a callback for forms on my site; I was wondering if theres a way to trigger a callback only on successful form submission?
[16:02:28] <indspenceable> i want to disable the submit button, only if none of the submit callbacks returned false.
[16:02:52] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: in the markup natively
[16:03:28] <ProLoser|Work> eddiemonge: i don't see it working
[16:03:28] <eddiemonge> indspenceable: are you doing an ajax submit?
[16:03:36] <ProLoser|Work> the selected attribute isn't moving when i inspect
[16:03:50] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: im not sure what your asking since i just joined and its my first day
[16:04:50] <ProLoser|Work> ...
[16:09:19] <ngharo> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/seBfE/1/
[16:09:32] <ngharo> Es0teric: almost got it..
[16:09:45] <esiegel> Hey everyone, is there a smooth scrolling script out there, that will let me set where the window scrolls to? I'd like it to scroll about 50px above the element (because I have a fixed position navigation bar). Thanks in advance.
[16:10:07] <indspenceable> eddiemonge: no, not ajax
[16:10:33] <Es0teric> oh, snap ngharo.. i didnt know jquery had a replacewith function...
[16:10:53] <ngharo> Es0teric: yeah i forgot about that one myself
[16:11:02] <ngharo> :)
[16:11:14] <Es0teric> that makes things 100x easier lol
[16:11:22] <eddiemonge> indspenceable: then if you submit the form the page will reload
[16:11:31] * ngharo goes afk
[16:11:48] <indspenceable> eddiemonge: Sometimes the request takes a long time, though, so we want to disable the button in the meantime.
[16:12:28] <indspenceable> eddiemonge: However, in some cases, there might be callbacks which prevent the form from actually submitting (client side validations etc) so we don't want to trigger this if those fail
[16:13:05] <indspenceable> i guess we could just put this as the last callback in the chain but i was hoping for a slightly more foolproof solution
[16:13:26] <Es0teric> but anyway, thanks, ngharo
[16:15:24] <deathstarblues> has anyone seen or gotten an actual invite for glide.io?
[16:16:54] <eddiemonge> indspenceable: at the start of the submit event handler, do "e.preventDefault; $(this).prop('disable');
[16:17:20] <eddiemonge> and then if the validation fails, enable the form
[16:34:00] <last1> I'm trying to get all the checked checkboxes except for those that have a certain class
[16:34:03] <last1> is that possible ?
[16:34:20] <last1> right now I use this: find('input:checkbox:checked')
[16:34:30] <last1> which gives me all the checkboxes
[16:35:23] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[16:35:29] <Germanaz0> I'm getting JSON.parse error in IE
[16:35:33] <Germanaz0> it says me unvalid character
[16:35:39] <indspenceable> eddiemonge: thanks - that's helpful!
[16:45:46] <Germanaz0> someone knows why JSON.parse in IE, throws an error
[16:45:51] <Germanaz0> with unvalid characters
[16:46:10] <silverwind> Perhaps that's because you have invalid characters.
[16:46:48] <silverwind> You could try to test it with jsonlint.com or some similar lint..
[16:48:54] <cj> is there a way to find the version of jquery if I load it from a command-line js interpreter?
[16:49:13] <cj> or maybe using grep? :)
[16:50:54] <Germanaz0> silverwind: the JSOn is valid
[16:50:57] <Germanaz0> but IE throws error
[16:51:57] <dw> Germanaz0: have you pasted it into http://jsonlint.com/ ?
[16:51:59] <silverwind> It could be anything then.... content-type... charset... a meteor
[16:52:11] <Germanaz0> dw yes
[16:52:15] <Germanaz0> it says that is valid
[16:52:28] <dw> can you show us the JSON? (also, how are you parsing in IE?)
[16:52:37] <Germanaz0> silverwind: header("Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8");
[16:52:44] <Germanaz0> then I do JSON.parse
[16:52:47] <silverwind> Germanaz0, For json? :/
[16:52:47] <Germanaz0> and throws error
[16:52:56] <Germanaz0> in IE
[16:53:02] <silverwind> You receive it in an iframe or what?
[16:53:12] <silverwind> Why would it be text/html?
[16:53:13] <Germanaz0> yes silverwind triying to upload a file
[16:53:15] <Germanaz0> with a iframe
[16:53:18] <silverwind> Ah ok
[16:53:34] <Germanaz0> and if I set on json header, then it tried to download the file
[16:53:35] <silverwind> Germanaz0, Try the jquery parseJson (Spelling?) function
[16:53:42] <Germanaz0> didn't worked too
[16:53:47] <Germanaz0> $.parseJSON
[16:53:51] <Germanaz0> or something like that
[16:54:02] <dw> Germanaz0: what is the specific error thrown by IE?
[16:54:05] <silverwind> That's a weird problem then :/
[16:54:25] <dw> and how are you recovering the JSON text form the iframe
[16:54:40] <Germanaz0> dw: just unvalid character
[16:55:03] <Germanaz0> with the ajaxForm plugin
[16:55:05] <Germanaz0> he handle everything
[16:55:30] <dw> Germanaz0: do you have character set detection enabled? (its on the View menu in IE i think)
[16:56:40] <Germanaz0> hmm currently don't know
[16:56:48] <Germanaz0> I do not work with IE, only linux or mac
[16:57:03] <Germanaz0> but I got noticed that the error is on IE
[16:57:19] <dw> i guess you need to start by getting access to IE, then
[16:58:09] <Germanaz0> yes dw  hahaha
[16:58:15] <Germanaz0> everybody use that thing called IE
[16:58:44] <Germanaz0> dw: what is the character detection in IE ?
[16:58:53] <Germanaz0> should this be ON or OFF ?

[17:00:43] <Guest42209> how to make a <ul> scroll up or down (with increasing speed depending on the amount of times clicked/tapped) on button tap/click
[17:00:49] <Guest42209> ?
[17:02:07] <aitiba> on uploadify when I click to delete a file form the queue I alert fileObj.name but I dont get any result. oncomplete I get the file name with the same sentence
[17:02:23] <eddiemonge> Germanaz0: have you showed an example yet?
[17:02:55] <eddiemonge> ? demo @ aitiba
[17:02:56] <bot-t> aitiba, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:03:19] <Germanaz0> eddiemonge: where ?
[17:04:44] <eddiemonge> Germanaz0: to us. of your problem
[17:05:48] <Germanaz0> ah nope, because I can't access to IE
[17:06:08] <Germanaz0> I only know that the string cannot be converted to JSON in IE
[17:07:42] <aitiba> eddiemonge, I dont know how can I charge uploadify plugin on jsfiddle
[17:07:43] <aitiba> http://jsfiddle.net/BK5Ay/
[17:08:24] <joshsmith> I'm wondering if it's good or bad habit to listen for the enter on .keypress() (inside an input) rather than listening on a submit
[17:08:26] <eddiemonge> Germanaz0: thats not that helpful. can you paste the code you are using?
[17:08:43] <eddiemonge> joshsmith: submit is better
[17:09:03] <joshsmith> eddiemonge: yeah, I figured, I just am using bootstrap and wanted to avoid overwriting the form styling
[17:09:11] <Germanaz0> here eddiemonge
[17:09:12] <Germanaz0> http://pastie.org/3292686
[17:09:47] <nathanw_> anyone know a way to make a UL scroll up in certain increments on button click ?
[17:10:05] <Germanaz0> eddiemonge: and this is the PHP that generates
[17:10:08] <Germanaz0> the JSon http://pastie.org/3292691

[17:12:03] <nathanw_> anyone know a way to make a UL scroll up in certain increments on button click ?
[17:12:22] <eddiemonge> Germanaz0: why are you binding to ajax_submit? and IE doesnt have a JSON.parse method. see ? parsejson
[17:12:22] <bot-t> Germanaz0, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[17:13:19] <Germanaz0> eddiemonge: yes, but parseJSON do no t works correctly :S
[17:14:16] <eddiemonge> Germanaz0: whats not working? are you doing data = $.parseJSON(data);
[17:15:25] <Germanaz0> yes eddiemonge and IE, says me unvalid character
[17:15:39] <Germanaz0> maybe the result could be cached
[17:15:43] <Germanaz0> don't know well
[17:16:19] <eddiemonge> Germanaz0: do you have a link to your working site? or the json that is return
[17:16:28] <nathanw_> anyone know a way to make a UL scroll up in certain increments on button click ?
[17:16:50] <Germanaz0> nope is in development, but appreciate the help :S
[17:16:57] <Germanaz0> have only in my localhost

[17:17:28] <nathanw_> ty
[17:18:37] <Germanaz0> will find the solution, maybe I should clean cache
[17:19:49] <aitiba> eddiemonge, do you see somethin extrange on http://jsfiddle.net/BK5Ay/?
[17:22:43] <eddiemonge> aitiba: yeah, you are using alerts instead of console.logs
[17:23:25] <eddiemonge> and you have inline JS
[17:24:42] <coldhead> ?alert
[17:24:42] <bot-t> Forget alertuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browsers built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[17:25:50] <Whirl3d> jesus christ the folks who write the standards for html just love to talk in circles using convoluted phrases and language elements that require a comprehensive knowledge of html to grasp something as simple as the "for" attribute of a label element. What a mess
[17:27:08] <aitiba> eddiemonge, I cant put the jsfiddle running. Can you try with this code? http://jsfiddle.net/BK5Ay/
[17:28:07] <aitiba> when I click on #cancel the console log are not appearing
[17:29:05] <coldhead> do you have the console open?
[17:32:31] <Whirl3d> I am using form.on({click:function (e){  ...}, focusin:function (e) {....}, focusout:function (e) {....}}) and find that in every handler I need the same 5 references (namely the target element, it's closest ".formField" element, that formField elements label child...etc.
[17:33:06] <Whirl3d> is there any way to just do this once and cache those references for every event?
[17:39:16] <coldhead> not that i know of, Whirl3d
[17:39:18] <coldhead> :(
[17:40:02] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reply, coldhead. At least now I can quit wasting time looking for a way to do it. LOL
[17:41:06] <Es0teric> when $('#somediv').click(function() { //event here }, function() { //after event is done do somethin here }); is done, thats to chain events together right?
[17:44:27] <nathanw_> can someone help me with click to scroll???
[17:44:35] <nathanw_> expoapp.media1.microhire.com
[17:45:05] <nathanw_> i
[17:45:14] <nathanw_> i've got it sort of working for the up arrow
[17:45:16] <chovy> $("a").click(function(){ $(window).scrollTo( $(window).scrollTop+$(window).height() ); });
[17:45:36] <nathanw_> it scrolls with the animation I want, but then when you click again it reverses instead of srolling more
[17:46:10] <chovy> sorry, that should be scrollTop not scrollTo
[17:46:16] <chovy> nathanw_.
[17:46:51] <nathanw_> ok one sec
[17:47:13] <nathanw_> am I meant to replace 'window' with the ul id ?
[17:47:22] <ereslibre> hi there. i am doing a $.get on a uri, and I want to replace one node on my current page with another node on the fetched page. problem is: how can I construct a jquery object to navigate through the fetched page ?
[17:47:29] <nathanw_> trying to scroll <li> inside a <ul> not the whole page
[17:48:58] <nathanw_> chovy: make sense?
[17:49:48] <chovy> nathanw_: use scrollTo then.
[17:50:10] <nathanw_> $("#scrlUp").click(function(){ $(window).scrollTop( $(window).scrollTo+$(window).height() ); });
[17:50:17] <chovy> scrollTo({ left: $("ul").scrollTo+ $("ul").width() });
[17:51:21] <chovy> baah.
[17:51:28] <chovy> scrollLeft() gets  you the current offset.
[17:52:11] <chovy> then do $("ul").animate( scrollLeft: scrollDistance )
[17:52:51] <nathanw_> huh
[17:53:00] <chovy> nm. ignore me.
[17:53:01] <nathanw_> ok
[17:53:08] <nathanw_> =\
[17:54:08] <nathanw_> anyone know how to scroll the contents of a <ul> on click
[17:55:03] <nathanw_> anyone know how to scroll the contents of a <ul> on click?
[17:59:37] <Whirl3d> wrap it in a scrollable div and scroll the dibv
[17:59:40] <Whirl3d> *div
[18:00:49] <Whirl3d> ereslibre, are you asking how you would load a portion of a fetched page into your existing page?
[18:01:07] <nathanw_> Whirl3d: set the ul to full height and set the containing div to scroll? the user needs to tap a button and have it scroll up (touch screen)
[18:02:44] <Whirl3d> so in the wrapper div, handle the click event and locate the mouse position. If it's at the top of the div and the ul element has a negative top position, animate it down...etc.
[18:03:17] <nathanw_> Ok... still over my head but i'll keep trying
[18:04:51] <ereslibre> Whirl3d: yes, trying with $('#node').load(location + ' #node'), if there is a better way please tell me :)
[18:12:21] <nathanw_> i have this so far
[18:12:21] <nathanw_> $('#scrlUp').click(function() {   $('ul#a2z').animate({scrollTop: $('ul#a2z li').offset().top - 30}); });
[18:12:26] <nathanw_> toggle scrolls :s
[18:23:47] <cepeda> buenas
[18:23:48] <Whirl3d> $("#scrollWrapper").on("click","a",function (e) { var targ=$("e.target"); var scrollIncr= (targ.is("#scrlUp"))?-30:30;var top=$("ul").position().top; $("ul").animate({top:top+scrollIncr},2000);});
[18:25:03] <zerobyte> ajax_dialog("#form-sign-in", { action: "login" }); ---> what exactly is "login"? a PHP funcion or a Javascript funct? :s
[19:22:51] <_zoggy_> jquery 1.7.2b1 is out btw
[19:23:17] <angelazou> I'm having a bit of problem getting a script to run
[19:23:37] <angelazou> actually, it is running, but the JSON is having a little problem...
[19:24:17] <angelazou> the result retrieval doesn't come back with anything, it's just stuck
[19:24:22] <angelazou> how could this happen?
[19:24:35] <angelazou> this is the url http://93hosting.com/domain-lookup/
[19:31:25] <NivenHuH> can someone recommend a text area auto-expander plugin?
[20:07:30] <skyflyer> any way to get elements based on wildcard?   $('event'+%+).get(); ? or remove them actually?
[20:08:04] <_zoggy_> regex
[20:09:15] <skyflyer> how about remove all elements from $('#events') except the class .header  ? say from a table?
[21:05:51] <Whirl3d> Jeesh! Quiet night around here tonight...
[21:07:52] <Whirl3d> _zoggy_: what do you mean by regex?
[21:10:12] <awches> hello everyone :)
[21:11:00] <Whirl3d> hello. It's kinda quiet here tonight. What's up?
[21:11:04] <chee> hello awches
[21:11:26] <chee> Whirl3d: everybody knows jQuery done
[21:11:31] <chee> *now
[21:12:08] <Whirl3d> thank goodness, huh?
[21:13:02] <Whirl3d> either that or everybody is doing something else...like prototype or something...
[21:13:08] <Whirl3d> it'd be just my luck
[21:22:08] <sherl0ck> i want a simple jquery slideshow plugin to put in a google map infowindow - http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/infowindow-simple.html - can someone plz suggest one that has left and right arrows and displays one image at a time?
[21:24:00] <Whirl3d> ?.cycle@sherlOck
[21:24:02] <bot-t> sherlOck, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[21:24:25] <Whirl3d> sorry I mean cycle plugin
[21:24:29] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/Bx4NJ/4/ - is it possible to center that arrow in the dropdown? Or would I need JS or something to measure and set the width of the UL?
[21:24:55] <Whirl3d> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[21:25:50] <Whirl3d> muzone, it looks pretty centered to me
[21:26:31] <sherl0ck> cool
[21:28:30] <muzone> Whirl3d: its not
[21:29:00] <muzone> Whirl3d: please hover the first TEST: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/Bx4NJ/5/
[21:29:34] <Whirl3d> muzone, I thought you meant centered on the thing it was pointing to. Which it is.
[21:30:17] <Whirl3d> muzone, if you centered it on it's content, it would look like it was pointing to a different menu
[21:30:46] <muzone> oh i see..
[21:31:15] <muzone> Whirl3d: what possibilities are we looking at here?
[21:31:50] <Whirl3d> Perhaps you want to center the menu under the arrow rather than the other way around.
[21:32:10] <Whirl3d> But even then, you have to worry about content going off the page/viewport
[21:33:29] <muzone> wait sorry i should rephrase myself
[21:33:38] <muzone> Whirl3d: At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/Bx4NJ/6/ - how do I center the dropdown arrow relative to the thing it's pointing to?
[21:36:21] <muzone> The JS has var width = element.width(); (for getting the width of the thing it's pointing to - for the ULs min-width) - maybe that can be used somehow?
[21:40:08] <muzone> Whirl3d: thanks man.. i hope i can rturn the favor some day :D
[21:40:12] <muzone> im off..
[21:40:13] <muzone> zZzz
[21:40:19] <Whirl3d> you could do this: $("#main-menu").on("mouseover","a",function (e) {var targ=$(e.target); var w=targ.width(); var sub=targ.find("ul"); var subw=sub.width(); var offx=Math.floor((w-subw)/2)
[21:40:20] <Whirl3d> wait
[21:41:21] <coldhead> a magpie's in a pottery bowl
[21:41:35] <Whirl3d> really?
[21:42:15] <coldhead> apparently
[21:42:37] <Whirl3d> breeders?
[21:42:51] <coldhead> oui
[21:42:52] <Whirl3d> or muzone?
[21:42:59] <Whirl3d> fortunately gone. LOL
[21:43:21] <coldhead> good sleuthing!
[21:43:43] <Whirl3d> google is my friend...or so it says
[21:45:47] <aqeel> hi
[21:46:06] <aqeel> how to implement jquery into external file and have it called
[21:47:36] <Whirl3d> ageel, if I get your question right, I'd suggest you start with jquery.com and run through the basic tutorial...it'll explain how to implement jquery
[21:49:04] <muzone> yoyo
[21:49:10] <chee> yoyo
[21:49:19] <muzone> i is still here Whirl3d hold on lemme massage ur code a little
[21:49:22] * tw2113 goes up and down
[21:49:24] <muzone> looks good thanks
[21:49:28] <muzone> heheh
[21:49:39] <Whirl3d> lol. I didn't finish, but you get the idea
[21:49:41] <aqeel> well all that is working and i can call external files via scripting but the jquery part fails
[21:50:22] <chee> aqeel: how does this failure manifest
[21:50:36] <tw2113> are you trying to use jquery functions before you've loaded jquery?
[21:50:39] <Whirl3d> did you run through the basic tutorial? Are you loading jquery before your other jquery scripts?
[21:51:07] <aqeel> <div id="divTestArea2"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> $(function() {         $("#divTestArea2").load("content.html #divContent"); }); </script>
[21:51:08] <Whirl3d> are you loading jquery in your document header? are you running other framewors that might be using the $ namespace?
[21:51:18] <aqeel> nope
[21:51:24] <aqeel> only jquery
[21:51:32] <aqeel> simple script
[21:51:46] <Whirl3d> and you can verify that jquery is loaded, right?
[21:51:52] <aqeel> yes
[21:52:05] <aqeel> i just want to put the load part into external file
[21:52:21] <aqeel> it works fine in html <script>
[21:52:32] <aqeel> i would like to move into external file
[21:52:47] <Whirl3d> so put it in it's own file and load it in your header just after jquery.
[21:52:50] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/Bx4NJ/8/ - can't I use $("ul:before", element).css("width", width); to set the width on #main-menu ul:before so that the arrows will always align in the center of the TATATATAs? (like if the content of #main-menu exceed its min-width - see the 2nd TATATATA)
[21:53:36] <aqeel> i tried but seems not working
[21:53:46] <chee> aqeel: let's see your code
[21:53:48] <aqeel> can provide the header code
[21:54:18] <muzone> * content of a #main-menu ul
[21:54:37] <chee> i don't load jquery in my header. i load it in my body after my content. like a boss.
[21:55:18] <chee> aqeel: please do
[21:55:47] <tw2113> $('#chee').toggleClass('boss');
[21:55:51] <aqeel> well it is just this code in its entity of html and body....
[21:56:07] <aqeel> i am trying to setup the jquery call in external file first
[21:56:29] <chee> wat
[21:56:45] <sherl0ck> any jquery slideshow plugins that do on demand image loading?
[21:56:55] <chee> aqeel: why does you paste the relevant part of your code at http://jsfiddle.com
[21:57:19] <chee> *why don't
[21:57:20] <aqeel> ???
[21:57:30] <aqeel> sorry i did not get you?
[21:57:53] <chee> aqeel: i meant to say "why don't you paste the relevant part of your code at http://jsfiddle.com"
[21:58:17] <chee> aqeel: so we can take a look at it. and see what the problem might be
[21:58:36] <aqeel> page cannot be displayed?
[21:58:45] <aqeel> error...???
[21:59:16] <chee> where !
[21:59:23] <tw2113> take off the double quotes
[21:59:30] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.com
[21:59:32] <chee> also
[21:59:36] <chee> http://jsfiddle.net
[21:59:46] <chee> i really am very tired
[21:59:57] <chee> aqeel: sorry. http://jsfiddle.net

[22:00:40] <aqeel> .com not working, .net is working
[22:00:50] <Cork> ya, .com doesn't exist
[22:01:31] <tw2113> my bad
[22:01:45] <chee> my worse. i typed it twice
[22:03:21] * tw2113 hopes the resig doesn't find out about this
[22:05:51] <aqeel> got to go...will be back...thanks....for th eupload site will take a shot at it
[22:09:14] <ontime> what's the best jquery modal window script?
[22:09:44] <Cork> do you have jquery-ui loaded on the page?
[22:10:14] <ontime> I have jquery library loaded, if that's what you are asking.
[22:10:28] <Cork> no
[22:10:34] <Cork> ?g jquery-ui
[22:10:38] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery UI - Home - http://jqueryui.com/
[22:10:59] <Cork> ontime: that said, if you don't it might not be worth loading it just for its dialogs
[22:11:08] <Cork> then theres loads of other options
[22:11:33] <ontime> Cork, you just opened up some new and great possibilities.  I did hear of jquery ui before, but didn't realize what it was...
[22:12:30] <ontime> ohcibi, I'll most likely use jquery ui for other things in this project later... but I think for now just a simple script to do just what I need it to do would be perfect.
[22:12:44] <ontime> ohcibi? wtf... uhmm.
[22:12:48] <ontime> Cork *
[22:13:50] <ontime> I just need something I can put any html inside of.
[22:14:10] <Cork> ontime: then somethin like ex. simple dialog
[22:14:16] <Cork> ?.simpledialog
[22:14:23] <bot-t> Cork, plugins.jquery.com - We've been looking to provide a higher-quality, spam-free experience at the plugins site for some time, and a major error on our part forced us to shut down the current site before we could put the... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/simpledialog
[22:15:52] <ontime> Cork: thank you.  I think this is just perfect.  Will this interfere with fadein() and fadeout()?
[22:16:08] <ontime> Orphis, I should say, will fadein and out interfere with simple dialog?
[22:16:26] <ontime> something is wrong with my keyboard.... :/
[22:16:30] <Cork> ontime: it already does that by default
[22:16:49] <Cork> http://www.mudaimemo.com/p/simpledialog/
[22:17:27] <Cork> but fadign the cover screen, might be tricky
[22:17:33] <Cork> *fading
[22:18:00] <ontime> well, in another of my projects, I need to have fadein and fadeout (header and content wrapper) and also need to have some kind of modal window that will work with it.  So far, fadein and fadeout seem to screw up lightbox.  I mean, lightbox won't even work.  I've double and triple checked the code.
[22:19:05] <Cork> ontime: as long as you don't fadein body it should be fine
[22:19:20] <ontime> why would that make any issues?
[22:19:36] <ontime> and I actually need to fadein, but not the body, a div inside of the body
[22:19:39] <Cork> cause everything visible on the page will exist in body
[22:19:40] <ontime> lightbox will not work with it.
[22:20:14] <ontime> maybe it is because I'm also fading the header, which is instead of in the head, it is in the body... because the script won't work in the head section.
[22:20:47] <Cork> uh.. head never contains any visible elements...
[22:20:57] <Cork> you mean html header?
[22:21:02] <Cork> as in <header> ?
[22:21:16] <ontime> one moment, phone.
[22:24:55] <ontime> Cork: you are right... I'm just tired.
[22:26:13] <ontime> anyway, why does fadein() kill lightbox? and will it kill simple dialog?
[22:27:11] <Cork> not sure, but it might be that the dialog gets hidden by the fade
[22:27:32] <ontime> that can't be why
[22:28:17] <ontime> I'm making sure the dialog is NOT inside of the faded divs.
[22:28:33] <ontime> but yes, you're right, that can definitely cause that problem.
[22:29:00] <rhizmoe> so wait, does jquery-mobile require jquery as well? be gentle
[22:29:28] <rhizmoe> jquery-mobile is at 1.0.1 btw (/topic)
[22:29:32] <ontime> the reason I'm fading anyway is because I wanted the page to fade out after say 5 minutes of user inactivity ... and to display an ad or message behind it.
[22:29:55] <ontime> and then fade back in when the user mouses inside the browser window
[22:29:56] <rhizmoe> why not fade the ad in?
[22:30:10] <ontime> it's not just about advertising....
[22:30:26] <rhizmoe> don't mind me
[22:30:58] <ontime> it's about a smooth way to catch a persons attention to the site when they are least expecting it to all disappear and then when they think something is wrong with the page, they try to move and it all fades back in .. it's actually a very smooth effect.
[22:31:25] <ontime> I don't mind anyone :p
[22:32:05] <Whirl3d> can you attach .on to a span element to handle events of it's children elements?
[22:32:50] <dmnd> does anyone know if there is a specific reason jquery doesn't let you specify an optional context for event handlers like (for example) underscore does? do you think they'd be likely to accept a patch that added an optional 5th argument to on()?
[22:33:50] <Whirl3d> dmnd, $("el").on("event","contextSelector",function (e) {})
[22:34:57] <dmnd> Whirl3d: I mean something to make this shorter: $("el").on("event", $.proxy(this.objectHandler, this))
[22:35:21] <dmnd> I'd like to write $("el").on("event", this.objectHandler, this) for instance
[22:35:30] <Cork> dmnd: on accepts the data section, isn't that enough?
[22:36:46] <Whirl3d> isn't that the same as $("el").on("event",this, this.objectHandler);
[22:37:03] <Cork> it is
[22:37:09] <Cork> event.data
[22:37:15] <Whirl3d> so, what's the prob lem again, dmnd?
[22:37:20] <dmnd> ok I am reading docs, thanks
[22:37:26] <Cork> lol
[22:38:11] <Whirl3d> do keyup events bubble up to span elements?
[22:38:42] <ontime> so why do they call it "easing"..?
[22:39:07] <Cork> Whirl3d: if you have a child element that can have focus, yes
[22:39:29] <Cork> ontime: cause the original plugin they imported was called easing
[22:39:43] <Cork> http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[22:40:10] <ontime> it just seems like a .... rather ... punctual effect, so why call it "easing" .. :p that's all
[22:40:31] <ontime> yes, that's the link I was just looking at
[22:40:32] <Cork> ontime: its not just one effect, its a lot of effects
[22:40:38] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/JMhyb/8/
[22:40:45] <ontime> oh ... I see now.
[22:42:01] <Cork> and i guess the name comes from the fact that it makes element ease into positon, instead of snapping there
[22:42:24] <ontime> yes, that makes sense.
[22:42:50] <ontime> I was looking at simple dialog and came up with that question ... the easing effect on that page seems a bit harsh or "attacking" ... haha. :p
[22:44:04] <dmnd> Cork, Whirl3d thanks, seems to work. Can't believe I never knew that :)
[22:49:11] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/JMhyb/17/ ----I can't get the text entered in the input field to change the bg color of the matching text in the popup div elements.
[22:49:25] <dmnd> actually I take that back, accidentally bound to the wrong div when I tested: http://jsfiddle.net/grt2G/
[22:54:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/grt2G/3/
[22:55:37] <dmnd> Whirl3d: you're missing the point
[22:55:43] <dmnd> my event handler is part of an object
[22:56:00] <dmnd> maybe it's a function on a View model in some MVC framework, etc
[22:56:53] <Whirl3d> I don't think you use .on in place of .bind like it appears that you are doing
[22:57:28] <dmnd> bind just calls on doesn't it?
[22:57:46] <dmnd> this is the impl of bind: return this.on( types, null, data, fn );
[22:58:28] <Es0teric> how do i use replaceWith() to change an element to an input field as many times as i want?
[22:58:45] <Whirl3d> As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document. For earlier versions, the .bind() method is used for attaching an event handler directly to elements. Handlers are attached to the currently selected elements in the jQuery object, so those elements must exist at the point the call to .bind() occurs. For more flexible event binding, see the
[22:58:45] <Whirl3d> discussion of event delegation in .on() or .delegate().
[22:59:18] <dmnd> exactly
[23:04:44] <Whirl3d> dmnd, the problem with the fiddle you posted seems to be a missing . in the class selectors....maybe
[23:04:59] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/grt2G/4/
[23:05:18] <dmnd> I see a dot
[23:05:23] <Whirl3d> changed the selectors to $(".el1") and $(".el2") from $("el1")
[23:05:53] <dmnd> sorry I mustn't have saved it or something
[23:06:01] <Whirl3d> not in your original link: http://jsfiddle.net/grt2G/
[23:06:01] <dmnd> that must have been really confusing :(
[23:06:22] <dmnd> gimme a sec, I'll fix it and demonstrate what I meant
[23:09:53] <mindis|wurk> Es0teric depends how you want it to happen. something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/K5B8p/
[23:10:44] <Es0teric> mindislwurk, no something like this -> http://jsfiddle.net/seBfE/3/
[23:10:52] <Es0teric> *mindislwurk
[23:11:14] <Es0teric> mindisIwurk
[23:11:26] <Es0teric> mindis|wurk *
[23:11:33] <Es0teric> i had to copy and paste ur name --_--
[23:12:00] <mindis|wurk> lol. just type mind and press tab to autocomplete. should work in most clients :P
[23:14:31] <Es0teric> mindis|wurk: oh, wow it does work lol
[23:15:59] <mindis|wurk> Es0teric but as to your problem, try http://jsfiddle.net/seBfE/4/
[23:17:04] <dmnd> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/grt2G/6/
[23:17:06] <Es0teric> mindis|wurk: is there any way i can make it more compact? like compress all of that into the first .on(click) event?
[23:17:17] <dmnd> also, I'm very sorry for the earlier mixup
[23:18:41] <mindis|wurk> Es0teric can't think of any way really. you'll need an event for detecting going out of focus
[23:19:03] <Es0teric> mindis|wurk: hmm that would require more code than what i have now right?
[23:19:23] <mindis|wurk> no, you're doing that already in a sense
[23:19:44] <mindis|wurk> what i meant that is that you already have two events and you can't really do it with any less
[23:22:29] <Es0teric> mindis|wurk: i see but why isnt the event changing when i press the enter key on the input field?
[23:24:29] <mindis|wurk> because there's no event handling for keys
[23:24:47] <Es0teric> mindis|wurk: what? for keys?
[23:24:56] <mindis|wurk> you only have events defined for clicks
[23:24:58] <Es0teric> you mean like.. onSubmit?
[23:25:36] <mindis|wurk> no, you can also detect keydown etc.
[23:26:23] <Es0teric> so if i wanted to detect the enter key
[23:26:44] <Es0teric> mindis|wurk in the input field THEN to remove the input field, it would be?
[23:27:16] <mindis|wurk> it wouldn't be much different from what you already have in the document click
[23:27:50] <Es0teric> i would have to find the key code for the enter key
[23:27:51] <Es0teric> right?
[23:27:58] <mindis|wurk> yes
[23:28:27] <mindis|wurk> http://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes like so
[23:29:09] <Cork> or you could use String.fromCharCode
[23:29:40] <Es0teric> mindis|wurk: so in the keypress thing would go in the first block right
[23:29:41] <Es0teric> ?
[23:30:02] <Es0teric> cork, what?
[23:30:45] <Cork> ?eval String.fromCharCode(13)
[23:30:47] <mindis|wurk> i can't solve everything for you :)
[23:31:08] <codepal> $(.el isn't defined
[23:31:12] <Cork> bah is the bot dead...
[23:31:16] <codepal> how do I find the scope of $ ?
[23:31:30] <Cork> codepal: you mean $('el.') ?
[23:31:37] <Es0teric> lol
[23:31:38] <Cork> opps *.el
[23:31:48] <codepal> nope $('blah').el
[23:31:59] <codepal> yeah
[23:32:11] <Cork> and whats el?
[23:32:43] <codepal> a reference to a DOM element
[23:33:00] <Cork> you mean a variable?
[23:33:20] <codepal> um no...
[23:36:39] <Whirl3d> dmnd, I have no idea what you are trying to accomplish...sometimes I think design patterns are really just esoteric ways of chasing one's one tail. I don't understand why you want to do something like that. http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/grt2G/9/
[23:36:58] <Whirl3d> And when I say I don't understand, it's not that I am saying you are wrong, I just don't understand...
[23:37:02] <Whirl3d> literally
[23:37:30] <dmnd> it's ok, thanks for the attempted help
[23:38:04] <Es0teric> why is it when i make this -> var this = $(this);, i get this rediculous error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token =
[23:38:19] <Es0teric> ?
[23:38:30] <Whirl3d> when would you use a design pattern like the one you demonstrated? What is the use of it?
[23:39:02] <dmnd> have you ever used backbone?
[23:39:31] <Whirl3d> Es0teric, because "this" is a reserved word
[23:39:36] <dmnd> basically it comes up whenver you have an object that represents a 'view'
[23:40:05] <Es0teric> Whirl3d: but i want to use that instance in a certain scope why cant i make a var storing $(this)
[23:40:58] <Whirl3d> you can, try:   var something=$(this);
[23:41:14] <Whirl3d> not var RESERVEDWORD=anything
[23:41:33] <Whirl3d> where, in your example the RESERVEDWORD was ironically "this"
[23:41:41] <someprimetime> so i'm loading some content with the ajax() method, and for some reason the javascript targets within that content don't work anymore
[23:41:43] <someprimetime> any idea why?
[23:41:44] <Es0teric> Whirl3d: i did var $this = $(this)'
[23:41:51] <Es0teric> and it worked
[23:42:09] <mindis|wurk> someprimetime probably because they weren't there when the events were defined
[23:42:12] <_zoggy_> use 1.7.2 beta1
[23:42:23] <someprimetime> mindis|wurk: do i need to use delegate() or something similar?
[23:42:26] <someprimetime> live()?
[23:42:27] <Whirl3d> because the four letters together that make the word: this cannot be used alone as a variable name
[23:42:30] <someprimetime> err not live
[23:42:33] <_zoggy_> .on
[23:42:34] <someprimetime> on()?
[23:42:37] <mindis|wurk> yar
[23:42:44] <Whirl3d> thisa or $this or uthis is fine
[23:42:47] <Whirl3d> but this is not
[23:43:34] <Es0teric> Whirl3d: i see i'll take note of that lol
[23:45:32] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, what do you mean by javascript targets?
[23:46:32] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: they are just my dom objects that i'm binding the click method to

[23:55:41] <angelazou> the error page is located at http://93hosting.com/domain-lookup/
[23:56:01] <angelazou> it's a domain search box, if you input anything in there, it's suppose to come back with results
[23:56:21] <angelazou> but instead, all I see is the loader image continue to scroll, no results
