[04:11:41] <jomofcw> Hello !
[04:11:41] <jomofcw> I don't really understand how modernizr kinda "replace" $.browser ... shall I remove all my $.browser ?
[04:27:34] <minikN> Good morning. I wrote this https://jsfiddle.net/qot0Lgg6/ to loop thru some fields and validate each of them. I want to break the .each() as soon as the if-statement returns false once. It logs "no good", but keeps iterating thru the array eventually returning true.. how can I break it if one field can't be validated.. ?
[04:29:22] <jerit> http://stackoverflow.com/a/17162375
[04:30:08] <minikN> But I'm returning false :o
[04:31:05] <xec> minikN: it stops at first false for me https://jsfiddle.net/qot0Lgg6/1/
[04:31:37] <xec> console only says "good" once
[04:32:06] <minikN> Hm, let me mess with it a bit xec. Thanks.
[04:32:42] <jerit> not sure why you don't just do if (!value) instead of creating a whole new variable for it
[04:32:59] <xec> thats just my code, it used to be a validator
[04:33:25] <xec> wanted it to be as similar to the original as possible while still running
[04:33:39] <jerit> My console logs "good" "no good"
[04:33:46] <xec> yeah thats what i said :)
[04:44:30] <minikN> Hm.. I can't get it to work, argh.
[04:47:35] <minikN> The whole idea is that I have a form with several input fields, but I only want to validate certain fields using jQuery validate, not the whole form, so I can't do something like $('#myForm').valid();. I just want to validate a couple of fields. Maybe you guys know how to go about that.
[04:51:33] <minikN> I got it.
[04:59:47] <lilalinux> minikN: add some class or data-foo attribute to the fields that you want to verify
[05:00:22] <minikN> That's actually a nice idea!
[05:01:53] <Cork> class means you could use it in the selector
[05:18:19] <lilalinux> Cork: same goes for attributes
[05:20:42] <dbugger> Hey everyone
[05:21:10] <dbugger> When I do a $.ajax and the answer is a 302... is there a way that I can get the new URL redirected page?
[05:27:49] <Cork> lilalinux: ya, but selecting on attributes is bad for performance
[05:28:01] <lilalinux> i see
[05:28:06] <Cork> dbugger: no
[05:28:23] <dbugger> Cork, :( Nothing I can do about it?
[05:28:24] <Cork> dbugger: 302 is resolved before javascript is notified on xmlhttprequeste:s
[05:28:38] <Cork> dbugger: don't do 302 server side on ajax requests
[05:29:10] <Cork> *xmlhttprequest:s
[05:29:47] <dbugger> I see..
[05:30:07] <Cork> dbugger: there is a header you can check for server side
[05:30:41] <dbugger> Cork, which?
[05:32:15] <Cork> dbugger: X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
[05:32:35] <Cork> (had to look haven't touch that code for a LONG time XD)
[05:35:15] <dbugger> Cork, I will take a look at it
[06:24:23] <ceeeem> hello! I have been trying to get jquery Dialog to work in GM userscript but it always comes out transparent and without styles. I am sure I am doing something really dumb but I can't figure it out
[06:24:41] <ceeeem> is anyone around who could help if I sent code?
[06:26:34] <ceeeem> https://thepasteb.in/p/lOhO002Rp5XcB
[06:26:53] <ceeeem> its just 3 lines, but even if i try to apply this on any other page via chrome console, it acts the same
[06:27:20] <ceeeem> the dialog appears, its movable, but the styles are just not there
[06:56:43] <AdamPDotty> I guess there is a proper way to load CSS at runtime.
[07:04:52] <Cork> AdamPDotty: no, you load css at page load and then modify the dom later (ex. add a class)
[07:05:24] <Cork> AdamPDotty: loading css is extreamly expensive as it forces the browser to rerender the entire page (as it has to check each element is a rule matches it now)
[07:06:16] <AdamPDotty> ° ceeeem
[07:06:20] <AdamPDotty> ^
[07:48:35] <linuxson> Okay....at the risk of sounding a complete noob....I am trying to break up my custom jquery code into function blocks which I then want to call into my html page. I know <body> has an onload function, but how can I call a jquery funciton from a <div> tag? Is that even possible?
[07:57:13] <ceeeem> Cork AdamPDotty sorry for delay. I am not exactly sure what you mean. I need to attach to my userscript the CSS files somehow, and I do not care that much about how expensive it will be, I just want it to work.
[07:57:23] <ceeeem> https://thepasteb.in/p/98hRLLzkogvCk
[07:57:51] <ceeeem> here is the example of the userscript, if you try to run it while on https://jqueryui.com/support/ page, it will show you the problem
[07:58:01] <Cork> ceeeem: so you need to create a <style> tag and inject it into the page
[07:58:10] <Cork> alternatively a <link> tag
[07:58:16] <ceeeem> Yeah, I am doing both
[07:58:18] <ceeeem> bot they do not work
[07:58:31] <ceeeem> take a look at https://thepasteb.in/p/98hRLLzkogvCk if you can please
[07:59:21] <ceeeem> I try both versions, but somehow they are overwritten by the page itself and I have no idea why
[07:59:48] <Cork> ceeeem: https://jsfiddle.net/eLarfq2o/
[07:59:57] <Cork> works fine
[08:00:40] <ceeeem> yes, that works for me as well, the problem is that I need to attach entire file
[08:00:49] <ceeeem> Cork
[08:01:04] <Cork> you can't attach a file you have to either read it, or have a server providing it
[08:01:27] <ceeeem> by attaching a file I mean that I am adding it in <link> or <style> @import
[08:01:38] <Cork> ya, but it can't link to a file
[08:01:43] <ceeeem> but that sometimes works, but on some pages it doesn't
[08:01:46] <Cork> the site doesn't have access to it
[08:02:32] <ceeeem> oh I see. so I have no other option than to copy-paste jquery UI styles into my userscript's <style>
[08:02:40] <Cork> yes
[08:02:48] <Cork> or link to a css from code.jquery.com
[08:03:04] <ceeeem> but.. I am doing that :)
[08:03:19] <ceeeem> https://thepasteb.in/p/98hRLLzkogvCk
[08:03:22] <ceeeem> do you see a problem here?
[08:03:39] <Cork> ya, don't use $('head')
[08:03:47] <Cork> head isn't an element in body
[08:03:59] <Cork> use $(document.head)
[08:05:29] <ceeeem> it behaves the same as $('head') for me
[08:06:03] <ceeeem> actually I have no problem with adding styles stuff to $('head') as long as I explicitly append all the CSS text
[08:06:12] <ceeeem> but if I try to link a file it doesn't work.. sometimes :)
[08:09:17] <Cork> ceeeem: https://jsfiddle.net/eLarfq2o/1/
[08:12:22] <ceeeem> this works the same way as my solution. I suppose I should ask on greasemonkey/tampermonkey forums, the problem im experiencing has probably something to do with how it applies the script
[08:13:08] <ceeeem> cork thanks thought!:)
[08:47:42] <jose3__> guys and gals! Helloo
[08:48:06] <jose3__> I am trying to use .clone(), all the docs are appending/prepending
[08:48:33] <jose3__> is there a simple way to clone and place the cloned item on top of itself?
[08:49:01] <jose3__> I was thinking to clone the item and append it to a classed div that hass specific location css ?
[08:51:15] <dglambert> morning
[08:51:23] <jose3__> mornin'
[08:51:33] <dglambert> hey
[08:53:20] <jose3__> hi
[08:53:25] <jose3__> there you are
[09:18:25] <titii> Please can some one help, I am struggling with the hover event on the LI to show megamenu (toggleClass(open)), but when I click inside the megamenu, the hover event being crazzy. The megamenu is fast showing/hiding when I am moving over it. Please help what I need to do... thanks
[09:21:14] <jtoy> Howdy Ho!
[09:37:38] <cambazz> hello i need to add a listener on an text email field for input and change events that calls e.stopImmediatePropagation()
[09:37:48] <cambazz> but i have no idea on how to
[09:41:38] <simbalion`> Can someone tell me what this is doing: let i = 0; $(this).attr('src', ++i % 2 ? cat : dog);
[09:42:17] <simbalion`> The parts I'm uncertain about are the ++i % 2 ? cat : dog, the rest of it I understand
[09:50:50] <z1haze_work> i have this codepen, http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/ygMEgP but i want to fix the button to the bottom once its scrolled to, the effect i am ending up with is that the event is firing after i have completely scrolled passed the element
[09:58:05] <MikeD_> simbalion: that's called the ternary operator
[09:58:26] <MikeD_> in this case it's also using a unary operator (++i)
[10:08:01] <simbalion> MikeD, thank you :)
[10:09:42] <simbalion> I'm trying to create a flickering neon effect using swappable images when hovering over an item, I got as far as swapping the images, however when the mouse leaves the link the img src is sometimes left in the 'off' position and it should reset to the 'on' position. Could someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/oBZMLx
[10:11:43] <z1haze_work> how do you have a fixed element that is contained?
[10:17:33] <decx> use css simbalion
[10:27:59] <simbalion> decx: thanks, but you cannot change img src with css.
[10:29:29] <decx> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jyBpLQ
[10:33:47] <cannap> he is slideUp async not or?
[10:34:02] <simbalion> decx: thanks but that doesn't really do what I want.
[10:36:47] <hazamonzo> hey folks. Im trying to use $('#myDiv').load('<URL>',function(){})
[10:37:34] <hazamonzo> Odd thing is... i get nothing returned and no erro in my browser console. I can't get anything back from the response, status or xhr in the function callback either
[10:37:49] <hazamonzo> Anything I can do to try and figure out why i might not be getting anything returned?
[10:38:58] <FilipNortic_> hazamonzo: does your request fire and what status does it say in your console?
[10:39:57] <hazamonzo> FilipNortic_: Well this is the thing... as far as I can tell it isn;t executing but i cannot see why. Thats why i don't get anything back from the status
[10:40:24] <hazamonzo> I've wrapped the function in a ready function and other functions in that ready function execute fine
[10:40:52] <hazamonzo> I'd expect if the resource i was trying to load did not exists or the URL was wrong then i would get something in my console but i get nothing
[10:41:11] <FilipNortic_> .load is just a wrapper for an ajax get where the succuess callback will run $("loaded").html(responesedata)
[10:41:55] <FilipNortic_> ehh no it a post
[10:41:57] <hazamonzo> Understood. I'll quickly pop a breakpoint in the retuned section of the load to make sure its running
[10:42:41] <hazamonzo> okay so the .load isn't executing. Thats the first bit
[10:42:53] <hazamonzo> Let me see if i can pastebin. Probably doing something stupid :)
[10:43:47] <FilipNortic_> yeah and you might wanna read the docs on load cause my explanition of it comes off wrong anyway I try it
[10:45:06] <FilipNortic_> hazamonzo: wait you cant call it $('#myDiv').load('<URL>',function(){}), you need $('#myDiv').load('<URL>',indata, function(){})
[10:46:58] <hazamonzo> FilipNortic_: pastebin.com/km1Byrcd
[10:47:03] <FilipNortic_> it can be called $('#myDiv').load('<URL>') and then it will assume that the sucess callback will be $('#myDiv').html(response) or you need to supply the data argument aswell $('#myDiv').load('<URL>','', function(){})
[10:47:12] <hazamonzo> I had a look at the docs but i might have missed something. I'll look again :)
[10:48:41] <FilipNortic_> hazamonzo: you need to add the data argument to the load call
[10:50:38] <FilipNortic_> hazamonzo:  that beeing said why do you wanna use load if you need to supply teh callback? I now there is some extra stuff you can do but do you use it that way?
[10:50:56] <hazamonzo> Done... its very odd though. Added a breakpoint to the console.log(response) line and its skipped over. Im 99% sure the .load isn't even being executed or at least, executing the returned function
[10:51:46] <hazamonzo> FilipNortic_: Honestly, i don't need the callback, i just want to load some HTML into a div. Would I be better off using $.ajax or something?
[10:52:00] <hazamonzo> then attaching the resulting HTML to my div manually?
[10:54:02] <FilipNortic_> well unless you do $( "#result" ).load( "<url> #container" ); you are usally better of with an ordinay ajax request yeah
[10:54:48] <hazamonzo> FilipNortic_: Sounds good. I'll give that a bash instead then. Appreciate the help :)
[10:55:57] <simbalion> Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? I want this to start flickering on hover, and stop flickering when hover ends. http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/OWpoRd
[10:58:33] <z1haze_work> thats a cool pen
[11:00:13] <simbalion> z1haze_work: yep, it is impressive.
[11:03:10] <z1haze_work> did you make it
[11:05:24] <FilipNortic_> simbalion: why do you define your functions inside the event handler that will confuse things more times then not
[11:07:46] <simbalion> FilipNortic_: Can you explain? I didn't write that pen I just added the mouseover part. I am kind of a newb with js still
[11:07:54] <FilipNortic_> simbalion: and you are supose to do (scope)  var myTimeout; myTimeout=setTimeout...; cleartimeOut(myTimout)
[11:10:14] <FilipNortic_> simbalion: well you wrapped the flicker and flickerPause functions inseide your .on() call instead of defining them outside and calling them inside
[11:13:52] <simbalion> FilipNortic_: I see what you're saying, thanks. Is this more appropriate?: http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/OWpoRd
[11:14:48] <FilipNortic_> simbalion: yes now you just need to set a varible for you timeout
[11:15:58] <hazamonzo> Thanks FilipNortic_ ajax works fine
[11:16:06] <hazamonzo> Not sure what was going on with .load though :s
[11:22:36] <patrickk> is there a GPL2 lightbox?
[11:30:52] <jtoy> Howdy
[11:30:57] <jtoy> I am using a .clone()
[11:31:13] <jtoy> can I clone directly on top of the element that I am cloning?
[11:35:41] <quechon> hello guys how can i run a function in another script like importing
[11:45:29] <Ken1> Hey everyone, i have a small fiddle here with a plugin i made for something specific (Small plugin) https://jsfiddle.net/dqdvkyt8/5/ Could anyone tell me why it triggers twice when you click on the button?
[11:46:21] <Ken1> It doesn't happen, if i don't replace the element, with another one. I also tried triggering the events, on the element before unwrapping it. But this results to the same.
[11:48:20] <simbalion> FilipNortic_: I don't understand, why would setting a variable help with stopping the flicker effect when the mouse moves away?
[11:50:32] <Ken1> I just noticed that on the fiddle, i didn't unwrap the wrapper, you can enable that by removing the comment slashes before the line. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[12:11:22] <sillyslux> Ken1 if i comment line 75 el.prepend('<input type="checkbox" />') then it logs only one 'triggered'
[12:18:06] <simbalion> Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? I want this to start flickering on hover, and stop flickering when hover ends. http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/OWpoRd
[12:26:21] <bbear> hello
[12:36:22] <jerit> I kinda hate that Visual Studio doesn't put the { on a new line with the if but does with the else http://pastebin.com/e1CrCQhs
[12:41:08] <foo> Does anyone have a favorite conversational interface framework? eg. something that allows me to "send" a message, "receive" a message from a user, whether it's typed or there are 3 options.
[12:49:22] <jerit> foo, I played with Signalr once upon a time but never managed to do very much with it
[12:50:53] <jerit> its not really client-side though
[12:58:21] <foo> jerit: thank you, will check i tout
[12:59:16] <quechon> can can i excecute a js file using getscript
[12:59:27] <quechon> how i meant
[13:01:09] <jerit> I wanna Jsfiddle something but it's not rendering properly -_-
[13:04:02] <jerit> https://jsfiddle.net/ar77o6Lf/
[13:04:10] <jerit> the icons aren't loading correctly :(
[13:05:22] <foo> jerit: check this out, "Turn on conversation" - https://space10-community.github.io/conversational-form/ - I'm thinking something like this
[13:23:27] <robertmaxrees> gooooooood morning, jquery.
[13:32:54] <foo> robertmaxrees: howdy
[13:33:04] <robertmaxrees> how goes?
[13:45:57] <foo> robertmaxrees: already, looking at building a conversational interface with CSS. I thought it was jQuery, but I guess it's CSS animations. #mindblown You?
[13:46:41] <robertmaxrees> Trollin and lollin
[13:46:58] <robertmaxrees> realized for the first time today that my new tankless water heater won't work when the power goes out, sooo that's neat.
[13:51:57] <Ziberius> hello
[13:52:07] <Ziberius> I have a problem with the extension validation
[13:52:35] <Ziberius> if I use it toghether with the accept attribute on the input I get an error saying "Please enter a value with a valid mimetype."
[13:52:41] <Ziberius> any idea how I can avoid this?
[13:52:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean jquery validate?
[13:53:15] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: yes indeed
[13:54:29] <robertmaxrees> can you show the code in a fiddle or something?
[13:54:38] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, http://stackoverflow.com/a/16322460/923919
[13:55:09] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: well i just tested with the jquery validation commented and the same thing happens...weird
[13:55:40] <robertmaxrees> where is the error coming from?
[13:57:20] <Ziberius> it has to be the jquery validator that message is nowhere to be found in the proyect...lets see if I can make a fiddle...give me a minute
[13:57:43] <moonpunter> you guys know like an old-school scoreboard at a sporting event
[13:57:49] <moonpunter> how it flips the text
[13:58:01] <moonpunter> is there a plugin that does that?
[14:05:10] <robertmaxrees> moonpunter i've seen stuff for clocks.
[14:05:17] <robertmaxrees> might be something out ther.e
[14:18:13] <moonpunter> this one is using images: http://www.radoslavdimov.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-digiclock/
[14:18:21] <moonpunter> which is conceivable since the text i have in mind is static
[14:18:25] <moonpunter> but seems silly
[14:18:44] <robertmaxrees> fork it and modify it then (shrug)
[14:21:48] <moonpunter> i think this is the direction to go in: http://nnattawat.github.io/flip/
[14:50:32] <jtoy> what upppppp
[14:50:40] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[14:59:57] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: the error occurs when selecting the file, and executing the validator...I am unable to replicate it with jsfiddle...will it help if I pastebin my code?
[15:00:13] <robertmaxrees> are you getting anything in the fiddle?
[15:01:24] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: nope, fiddle shows no error
[15:17:15] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: found the error message, its in additional-methods.js wich I use to validate extensions of files
[15:17:30] <Ziberius> thing is it doesn't seem to play well with accept attribute
[15:54:44] <simbalion> Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? I want this to start flickering on hover, and stop flickering when hover ends. http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/OWpoRd
[16:02:08] <moonpunter> There is a hover method...
[16:03:12] <moonpunter> If I'm not crazy, it does what you want without needing to specify mouseout
[16:05:17] <moonpunter> Anyway, it's mouseleave not mouseout
[16:05:19] <moonpunter> I think
[16:09:03] <simbalion> moonpunter: I tried using mouseleave and also tried using .hover and still, when the mouse moves away the flickering effect goes on forever? http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/OWpoRd
[16:11:27] <moonpunter> Maybe a container to hover over and that cancels the event as a trigger
[16:11:36] <moonpunter> Or bind an event to the rest of the page that makes sure it's off
[16:52:04] <simbalion> I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong with .hover(), for example, this should only activate flicker() on hover, shouldn't it? But it is active on page load: http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/OWpGXr?editors=1010
[17:09:14] <merlin2049er> hi
[17:09:22] <merlin2049er> is this jquery?  $(".owl-carousel").owlCarousel();
[17:09:35] <robertmaxrees> it uses jquery.
[17:09:45] <robertmaxrees> simbalion easy
[17:10:03] <robertmaxrees> $(".neon").hover(flicker()); <- this runs flicker on pageload and assigns the return as the handler for that .hover() call.
[17:10:14] <robertmaxrees> you want to assign the function object itself as the handler.
[17:10:21] <robertmaxrees> so ditch the () for the call and just do $(".neon").hover(flicker);
[17:10:37] <simbalion> Ahh
[17:10:44] <robertmaxrees> but you also need to fix a logic error.
[17:10:59] <robertmaxrees> every time you over over it, you'll run that function again.
[17:11:13] <merlin2049er> hello
[17:11:18] <simbalion> I think the function runs forever once it starts
[17:11:24] <robertmaxrees> so the more times you run the hover, the more times it'll run the function.
[17:11:31] <robertmaxrees> right but it'll get faster and faster.
[17:11:34] <simbalion> I thought I'd need a mouseleave function to stop the hover
[17:11:42] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, too.
[17:11:44] <simbalion> er, to stop the flicker
[17:11:55] <simbalion> I welcome any advice :)
[17:12:05] <robertmaxrees> that's basically what you do.
[17:12:11] <robertmaxrees> a mousein and mouseout handler.
[17:12:26] <robertmaxrees> hello merlin2049er
[17:12:34] <simbalion> Ah ok :), is there an appropriate way to stop a function that's running?
[17:13:00] <merlin2049er> i have no idea how to get owlcarousel running
[17:13:03] <robertmaxrees> you could set a bool in a shared scope and check that before trying to run the timeout again
[17:13:15] <robertmaxrees> merlin2049er should be pretty easy.
[17:13:20] <robertmaxrees> just need to include the files and init it.
[17:13:40] <merlin2049er> how do i get that jquery running inside my rails app
[17:13:46] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[17:13:47] <merlin2049er> $(".owl-carousel").owlCarousel();
[17:13:51] <robertmaxrees> you want jquery on your page.
[17:14:18] <robertmaxrees> though rails has that asset pipeline thing.
[17:14:23] <robertmaxrees> go read up on that i guess.
[17:14:31] <robertmaxrees> you need jquery, then owl carousel included.
[17:22:34] <simbalion> Do methods have to follow Elements? For example can I write queue() by itself instead of $(???).queue()?
[17:22:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:22:52] <robertmaxrees> that's a jquery method.
[17:24:10] <robertmaxrees> requires the $()
[17:24:21] <simbalion> I see
[17:24:32] <robertmaxrees> has to do with inheritence.
[17:55:46] <simbalion> Hrm, I'm stumped looking for a way to kill flicker() when the .hover() event ends.. can anyone help? http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/RKpmjN
[17:56:41] <robertmaxrees> so what about my explanation was confusing?
[17:57:53] <simbalion> Nothing, I just don't know how to stop the function, .stop() is only meant for animations, I don't think it would work for this
[17:58:13] <robertmaxrees> so then do what i suggested :)
[17:58:13] <simbalion> I've been poking around docs and searching but I haven't found any clues yet
[17:58:32] <robertmaxrees> ... heh i already explained how to do it.
[17:58:35] <robertmaxrees> it's not a jquery thing.
[17:58:37] <simbalion> I don't see where?
[17:59:05] <robertmaxrees> "you could set a bool in a shared scope and check that before trying
[17:59:05] <robertmaxrees> to run the timeout again
[17:59:07] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[17:59:10] <robertmaxrees> but there you go.
[17:59:41] <simbalion> oh I thought that was for merlin2049er
[17:59:56] <robertmaxrees> newp.  sorry.
[18:01:13] <simbalion> So, on mouseout test=true, and execute setTimeout only if test=false?
[18:01:23] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:16:44] <bbear> hi
[18:16:49] <bbear> I've got a question
[18:16:51] <simbalion> robertmaxrees: Well I thought I was doing it right but it's not working as expected so I must have done it wrong... http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/RKpmjN?editors=1010
[18:17:07] <bbear> when I do $('#my_id'), what I get is a list whose first element is what interest me.
[18:17:28] <bbear> Is there a standard method to retrieve the first element, or must I address the interesting object by indexing the list ?
[18:18:05] <patrickk> .first
[18:18:14] <bbear> I'm afraid i'm working with an old tutorial. Thanks patrickk
[18:18:38] <patrickk> and IDs has to be unique, can't have the same ID for different elements on the page
[18:19:07] <patrickk> bbear > https://api.jquery.com/first/
[18:20:38] <bbear> thant's not quite working
[18:21:31] <robertmaxrees> bbear $('#my_id') only gets one element
[18:22:03] <bbear> still to access atributes I have to use indexing
[18:22:15] <robertmaxrees> you mean DOM properties?
[18:22:15] <bbear> $('#my_id')[0].innerHTML is ok
[18:22:22] <robertmaxrees> or .prop('innerHTML')
[18:22:25] <bbear> $('#my_id').innerHTML is ok
[18:22:31] <bbear> $('#my_id').innerHTML is not ok
[18:22:34] <robertmaxrees> ....
[18:22:43] <robertmaxrees> right, you need the raw dom node.
[18:22:47] <robertmaxrees> or use .prop
[18:22:51] <bbear> ok
[18:23:25] <robertmaxrees> simbalion .hover takes two functions.
[18:23:48] <robertmaxrees> you're giving it one and then some other thing.
[18:23:50] <bbear> where could you get this API doc?
[18:24:07] <robertmaxrees> for prop()?
[18:24:14] <jak2000> hi friends
[18:24:18] <jak2000> robertmaxrees want 1 beer?
[18:24:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:24:33] <robertmaxrees> bbear http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[18:27:22] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[18:28:10] <jak2000> yes?
[18:28:25] <robertmaxrees> just hate giving people info and then getting no response.
[18:42:24] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/t8o3tbhe/   why not close initally the dialog box?
[18:43:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:43:29] <robertmaxrees> you mean why doesn't it open?
[18:44:09] <jak2000> initially need only see the button "open"
[18:44:20] <jak2000> then when user click on open button, open the dialog
[18:44:29] <robertmaxrees> so what's broken?
[18:44:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[18:44:58] <jak2000> run the fiddle
[18:45:09] <jak2000> at the right bottm you see the button
[18:45:12] <jak2000> and the dialog..
[18:45:12] <robertmaxrees> right, you have a JS error.
[18:45:31] <robertmaxrees> Desactivar and EditaPersona aren't defined >.>
[18:46:18] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t8o3tbhe/2/
[18:46:20] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:46:59] <jak2000> see: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/t8o3tbhe/3/
[18:47:16] <robertmaxrees> ... open your console, duder.
[18:47:18] <jak2000> ok see
[18:47:19] <robertmaxrees> fix errors.

[18:48:05] <jak2000> yes
[18:48:14] <jak2000> error typed
[18:48:17] <robertmaxrees> you mean function.
[18:48:32] <robertmaxrees> fix the js error s and sould should be fine.
[18:49:55] <jak2000> robertmaxrees know about bootstrap?
[18:49:59] <robertmaxrees> a bit.
[18:50:02] <robertmaxrees> what do you need?
[18:50:41] <jak2000> first not know why my modal window havent these aparence: https://postimg.org/image/7soamkvk9/   if i defined the rows and columns (see by sample line 11,12,13
[18:50:58] <robertmaxrees> that's a jquery ui dialog.
[18:51:04] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to mix jqui and bootstrap.
[18:51:09] <robertmaxrees> which is a generally bad idea.
[18:51:47] <jak2000> under jquery ui dialog i want ceate 3 columns by sample
[18:51:54] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:52:01] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to use jquery ui or bootstrap?
[19:00:40] <jak2000> both
[19:23:27] <wilfred> hello, is anyone familiar with this plugin ? https://jqueryvalidation.org/
[19:23:44] <wilfred> just trying to get a recommendation for how to validate in jquery before i dive into something
[19:34:01] <snover> wilfred: prefer html5 validation.
[19:36:40] <simbalion> I am trying to adapt this: http://codepen.io/simbalion/pen/RKpmjN?editors=1010 to work with this: codepen.io/simbalion/pen/OWpGXr?editors=1010 ... In the first pen, the flickering works on hover, but the on/off state is unpredictable on mouseout, however I don't know if that matters because the second pen is my real goal, to swap a 'src' instead of a css class, but it isn't working. Can someone help me?
[19:38:53] <snover> simbalion: attr(name) returns a string, all you are doing is getting a string and then replacing a value in this anonymous string that will disappear at the end of the statement
[19:39:10] <snover> you may also want to consider the use of css animation instead.
[19:40:45] <simbalion> CSS can't change SRC attributes, I have explored CSS options, the only way to do this right is js/jQuery. So with regards to attr(), I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, do I need to store the string in a variable or something? My understanding of what I've written is that attr('src) gets the source of the img, then replace() changes the src, you're saying that's not how it works?
[19:41:41] <snover> no, generally, the way to do an interactive image swap is to use a css sprite map, and modify the background-position
[19:42:09] <snover> no js needed
[19:42:24] <simbalion> That's a hack method and is not necessarily the Truth and the Way. It was smart a few years ago when computers were slow and JS could cripple a page. Today JS is the way to do what I want to do.
[19:42:44] <snover> it’s actually to avoid a flash of unstyled content because the browser hasn’t loaded the new image yet.
[19:42:52] <simbalion> So can you help me with the right way to use .replace() to change the 'src' attribute?
[19:43:46] <snover> as far as the string question goes, attr('src') returns a string, which is not a reference to a string. if you want to update the src attribute, you need to set it.
[19:46:38] <simbalion> So the string says blahblah-thing.png, and my understanding of .replace() is that it is intended to replace portions of strings, so .attr('src').replace('thing','otherthing') should change the img src to = blahblah-otherthing.png. You're saying that's wrong?
[19:47:08] <snover> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[19:47:24] <simbalion> I can set the whole string but there's 8 menu items so I'd have to program 8 unique URLs, I think a dynamic way to do it is smarter.
[19:47:32] <snover> “The replace() method **returns a new string** with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement.”
[19:47:51] <simbalion> snover, so exactly what I said
[19:48:06] <snover> the smart way to do it is the way i mentioned already, using css and not javascript.
[19:49:28] <simbalion> hrm, does it need to be like .attr('src',function(){$(this).attr('src').replace('lite','dark')});?
[19:49:47] <uskerine> hi
[19:50:11] <uskerine> is there any way to serialize a form in such a way that certain subsets of fields are grouped in json arrays? JSON.stringify( $('#sign-in-form' ).serializeArray())
[19:50:40] <uskerine> so for example while signing you could have regular fields but then a field named "shipping address" which is actually another JSON object with "addres_line_1", "address_line_2", etc.
[19:55:18] <uskerine> I am surprised how difficult is to get help with JSON
[20:11:59] <rocktop_> in http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/   how can I hide or disable the future days and months ?
[20:21:43] <uskerine> from2js
[20:21:48] <uskerine> is what I was looking for
[20:21:51] <uskerine> form2js
[21:14:54] <wilfred> snover: yes html5 validation is what im  using at the moment
[21:15:34] <wilfred> snover: but i have some events that will change one <input>'s value based on the changing value of another <input>
[21:16:05] <wilfred> and i dont see how to prevent the event from being triggered if the value is not valid without checking it in javascript/jquery
[23:38:01] <Forbidd3n> Anyone here know why in Firefox the jquery datepicker select month and year flickers?
