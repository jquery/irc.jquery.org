[01:31:36] <Bauer> guys, why is the onpaste event not working here? http://jsfiddle.net/ek2y51bs/
[01:35:54] <Cork> Bauer: s/on//
[01:36:38] <Bauer> ahhh, thanks Cork - as always :)

[01:37:46] <MH35> Hello
[01:40:25] <MH35> I use jQuery UI and want to animate with changing class A to class B. It should be toggleClass, but is it true?
[01:41:13] <Cork> MH35: jquery doesn't animate classes
[01:41:17] <Cork> you need jqueryui for that
[01:41:27] <MH35> I'm using jQuery UI
[01:45:11] <Cork> MH35: then yes you can animate with toggleClass
[01:45:40] <MH35> What should be the second argument?
[01:45:58] <Cork> ?g api.jqueryui.com toggleClass
[01:45:58] <b-ot> Cork: Toggle Class | jQuery UI → http://jqueryui.com/toggleClass/
[01:46:14] <MH35> .toggleClass('A B', ?, [animating arguments])
[01:46:44] <MH35> I want to remove class A and add class B
[01:46:52] <Cork> bah stupid google
[01:46:55] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/toggleClass/
[01:47:19] <MH35> I'm reading http://api.jqueryui.com/toggleclass/ , but I cannot understand.
[01:47:22] <Cork> the arguments inside [] is optional and can be skipped
[01:47:45] <MH35> OK, I'll try it.
[01:48:35] <s5fs> Cork: hey how goes
[01:48:53] <Cork> s5fs: no problem to day as far as i know :)
[01:49:22] <s5fs> yeah, been pretty quiet. i had a bump with learn.jquery.com i think, but that may have been it.
[01:49:43] <s5fs> thanks for holding it down while things were crazy haha
[01:49:46] <Cork> s5fs: yesterday was a bit bumpy though
[01:50:49] <MH35> It worked! Thank you very much.
[01:50:49] <s5fs> yeah sunday we did some migrations and that required updating dns. this took a while to propagate but it looks good now.
[01:51:07] <Cork> ya
[02:00:31] <Bauer> Cork: now its not working again... why? http://jsfiddle.net/ek2y51bs/1/
[02:01:22] <Cork> Bauer: e.val() ??
[02:01:41] <Bauer> Cork: I am trying to retrieve the textarea's pasted content...
[02:01:52] <Cork> e == event
[02:01:58] <Cork> it isn't a jquery object
[02:02:27] <Bauer> oh, hmmm.. how do I pass that object to function then?
[02:02:33] <Cork> Bauer: also please don't kill kittens :)
[02:02:38] <Cork> don't use alert for debugging
[02:03:16] <Bauer> heheh, ok - my condolences to the kittens! :)
[02:05:26] <Bauer> Cork: here is updated: http://jsfiddle.net/ek2y51bs/2/ but now I get some empty console.log.. not sure whether its some error?
[02:07:15] <Cork> Bauer: http://jsfiddle.net/ek2y51bs/3/
[02:09:53] <Bauer> Cork: how did you know to do it this way? and secondly, it still outputs the first paste, even if you continue pasting stuff.. I want it to take the CURRENT content of the textarea on paste..
[02:10:13] <Cork> Bauer: jquery creates a fake event object
[02:10:22] <Cork> it doesn't contain newer event values
[02:10:29] <Cork> (like clipboard)
[02:10:40] <Cork> the rest is just reading the standards
[02:11:13] <Bauer> where? what did you search for? and even then, it doesnt seem to do exactly what I want.. I want to get the content of textarea after paste
[02:12:05] <Cork> Bauer: then you most likely want input not paste
[02:12:38] <Cork> "the answer to everything, use input" :D
[02:13:01] <Bauer> Cork: but I want to trigger by paste event, no?
[02:13:12] <Cork> Bauer: input triggers on input and paste
[02:13:26] <Cork> paste triggers before the value is added to the field
[02:13:35] <Cork> (it is meant to let you modify the content before it is added)
[02:13:49] <Cork> input fires after the input value has been changed
[02:14:06] <Bauer> wont it fire for every character inserted by paste?
[02:14:12] <Sendoushi> hey guys. anyone knows how to style a wildcard? like $('.class *') ?
[02:14:22] <Cork> no it fires like paste was one keypress
[02:14:34] <Cork> Sendoushi: uh, what?
[02:14:44] <Sendoushi> * < wildcard
[02:14:46] <Cork> Sendoushi: add a css rule
[02:15:26] <Sendoushi> i can't really do it but you have me an idea... i can just append <style></style> to the element
[02:15:29] <Sendoushi> ok thanks
[02:18:05] <mooncup> is there a "correct" way to activate a datepicker
[02:18:14] <mooncup> it needs to appear when a certain icon is clicked
[02:18:28] <Cork> the show method?
[02:18:36] <mooncup> that sounds ideal, thanks
[02:18:44] <mooncup> do I just call the selector for the input?
[02:18:48] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-show
[02:18:57] <mooncup> lovely, cheers
[03:42:36] <Omar-> hi, ready for a dumb question?
[03:43:00] <Omar-> why $(".selector").prev(".selector").prev(".selector") doesn't work?
[03:43:23] <Cork> Omar-: prev checks if the previous sibling matches
[03:43:31] <Cork> it does not walk until one is found
[03:43:49] <Omar-> hi Cork
[03:43:51] <Spipmalion> hello
[03:44:09] <Cork> so if you have <div></div><p><div class="a"></div>
[03:44:19] <Cork> $('.a').prev('div') will give you []
[03:44:24] <Cork> opps
[03:44:30] <Cork> meant <div></div><p></p><div class="a"></div>
[03:44:58] <Spipmalion> any idea why my bootstrap carousel suddenly stopped working ? http://bit.ly/1rHAE94  (page competences)
[03:45:02] <Omar-> Cork: I'm using .prevAll(), When I .get().reverse() the retrieved object, I select specific element using .eq()
[03:45:03] <Cork> Omar-: if that is the case you hit you want prevAll('.selector').first()
[03:45:26] <Omar-> yet I'm get context: undefined
[03:45:41] <Cork> you don't want to use .get()
[03:46:07] <Omar-> Cork I don't want .first() I want second previous element match "class"
[03:46:29] <Omar-> Cork: I'll get you a fiddle
[03:47:27] <Omar-> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/meoybdpq/ click "up arrow" then check console log
[03:47:48] <Omar-> Cork: if you want to know what I'm trying to achieve, click "down arrow".
[03:48:11] <Omar-> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/a/26109698/1771795
[03:49:07] <Cork> Omar-: so you want $(this).nextAll('.ui-first-child').eq(1)
[03:49:32] <Cork> or rather something like
[03:50:14] <Omar-> Cork: exactly, "down arrow" works fine, "up arrow" is giving me hard time :)
[03:50:38] <Omar-> but not .nextAll(), I want previous elements
[03:50:54] <Omar-> I know it's rather complicated but it's achievable.
[03:51:29] <Omar-> and if you a SO user, hit the upvote button :P
[03:51:37] <Omar-> you're*
[03:52:02] <Cork> var firsts = $(this).prevAll(".ui-first-child"), buttons = $(this).parent(); firsts.eq(1).before(buttons.slice(firsts.eq(1).index() + 1, firsts.eq(0).index + 3)))
[03:52:42] <Omar-> damn, too complicated lol
[03:52:46] <Omar-> I'll try it
[03:53:12] <Cork> basically you want to grab the child index of the current first-child
[03:53:26] <Cork> and the prev first-child
[03:53:50] <Cork> then slice the elements from all the elements after first-child to the next one
[03:54:03] <Cork> and add them before the prev first-child
[03:54:49] <Cork> Omar-: actually nextUntil should make it simpler
[03:55:29] <Omar-> Cork: all elements buttons are siblings, they share one parent
[03:56:10] <Cork> var firsts = $(this).prevAll('.ui-first-child'); firsts.eq(1).before(firsts.eq(0).nextUntil('.ui-first-child'').addBack())
[03:56:13] <Cork> should work
[03:58:19] <Omar-> Cork: wonderful!
[03:59:48] <Omar-> Cork: it workd, but does it move the whole row of buttons where "up arrow" is hit?
[04:00:23] <Cork> Omar-: .nextUntil('.ui-first-child') grabs all elements after .ui-first-child
[04:00:29] <Cork> and then adds back it self to the list
[04:00:52] <Cork> Omar-:* all elements after .ui-first-child until the next .ui-first-child
[04:01:11] <Cork> and then moves those elements before the prev .ui-first-child
[04:01:35] <Omar-> Cork: amazing. But why was it more complicated than "down arrow"? or am I complicating it?
[04:01:53] <Omar-> var moveAfter = $(this).nextAll(".ui-last-child").eq(1);
[04:02:02] <Omar-> var prevBtns = $(this).prevUntil(".ui-last-child").addBack(),
[04:02:02] <Omar->                 nextBtn = $(this).next(".ui-last-child"),
[04:02:02] <Omar->                 setBtns = prevBtns.add(nextBtn);
[04:02:02] <Omar->             moveAfter.after(setBtns);
[04:02:20] <Omar-> "down arrow" which works fine
[04:18:01] <Omar-> Cork: Thanks a lot :)

[04:42:53] <stack> does anyone knows if that is possible to tell a canvas to reduce quality and increase speed when doing drawImage ?
[04:48:44] <decx> drawimage is pretty fast already
[05:46:52] <robban> Hi all! Can someone help me understand why this does not work? http://jsfiddle.net/tzqxx9v4/4/ . It both looks a bit strange, and does not behave as supposed to.
[05:47:13] <robban> Is this a problem with jsfiddle?
[05:47:33] <robban> Or the coder? :-)
[05:48:24] <Tobbe> Hi, I found something weird with fadeOut(). If I have a div with an img and a p and run fadeOut on the div only the image is actually faded. The text stays full opacity until the end when it just dissapears. If I add another p it all works. Anyone know what's up? http://jsfiddle.net/6d3qxo5b/ (remove the last p and you'll see the problem)
[05:50:11] <Tobbe> doing it with animate() instead shows the same problem
[05:51:33] <nodedfree> Tobbe, paste the code you trying to perform
[05:51:44] <nodedfree> http://pastebin.com/
[05:53:09] <phx> morning
[05:53:29] <phx> how should I load jquery.rest (https://github.com/jpillora/jquery.rest) with requirejs? simply putting it into the argument list doesn't work
[05:55:08] <phx> http://pastebin.com/uJr6Jv5H this is what i've got so far
[05:59:20] <Tobbe> nodedfree: it should all be in the jsfiddle link I posted
[05:59:35] <Tobbe> here it is again: http://jsfiddle.net/6d3qxo5b/
[06:00:50] <nodedfree> Tobbe, there is no <p> and no jquery code
[06:00:57] <nodedfree> only a + img
[06:02:07] <Tobbe> doh http://jsfiddle.net/6d3qxo5b/2/
[06:02:13] <Tobbe> nodedfree: try that one instead :)
[06:02:47] <Tobbe> as I said, what I have there works, but remove the last p and it breaks
[06:04:14] <nodedfree> Tobbe, http://jsfiddle.net/6d3qxo5b/3/
[06:04:32] <nodedfree> you did the fadeout to the whole div.. only img needed
[06:06:06] <Tobbe> nodedfree: no, I want both the text and the image to fade out
[06:07:01] <nodedfree> this is what happend when i opened the fiddle
[06:07:04] <Tobbe> nodedfree: look at this http://jsfiddle.net/6d3qxo5b/4/
[06:07:11] <Tobbe> pay attention to the text
[06:07:14] <Tobbe> it is not fading
[06:07:30] <nodedfree> it is..
[06:07:33] <Tobbe> it's full opacity for 1000ms and then it dissapears
[06:07:38] <nodedfree> are you on IE 5?
[06:07:44] <Tobbe> latest chrome
[06:07:49] <nodedfree> src
[06:07:50] <nodedfree> sec
[06:09:22] <nodedfree> it is fading very well.. maybe on you version on your machine, you made css transition on the <p> and that is the problem,
[06:11:58] <Tobbe> nodedfree: no. If I add a second <p> it works as it should (both the img and the two <p>s fade out properly). If I have only one <p> and no img it also works properly. But if I have exactly one img and one <p> the <p> is not fading
[06:13:07] <EoN> Has anyone here used the jquery-indexedDb plugin?
[06:13:22] <EoN> i started using it. but i am wondering if it may be the case that NO-ONE uses it?
[06:13:28] <EoN> like... surely they must. what else do people use?
[06:16:03] <Tobbe> nodedfree: same problem if switch to h1 instead of p: http://jsfiddle.net/6d3qxo5b/5/
[06:17:13] <nodedfree> Tobbe, when i click both elements are fading at the same exact moment.. maybe try from another client (firefox, ie)..
[06:18:12] <Tobbe> nodedfree: I would if I could. I'm on a chromebook
[06:18:58] <Tobbe> Actually, let me boot up another computer and check it there...
[06:25:55] <Tobbe> nodedfree: yes, works as intended on firefox on another computer
[06:26:13] <EoN> has anyone here ever used local storage?
[06:27:46] <nodedfree> Tobbe, it should work with chrome as well.. check here - http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[06:28:15] <pocitadlo> Hey, anyone knows how to unbind all of the mouse down/move/up jquery mobile event listeners from a page?
[06:30:50] <gumble> is cdnjs.com a reliable cdn?
[06:37:10] <gumble> oh I mean cloudfare not cdnjs
[06:40:23] <NoiseEee_> you know whats a reliable cdn? the machine you're serving your site with
[06:44:39] <decx> yeah but where will your sites js be served from when you site is down?
[06:45:08] <BillCriswell> decx asking the hard hitting questions as always.
[06:51:15] <EoN> god i hate indexedDb :(
[06:51:22] <EoN> nosql is the worst thing to ever happen to the web.
[06:53:08] <HideMyAss> how do i verify in Google Chrome if the Echo cancel and Noise reduction is set to true or false?
[06:59:29] <BillCriswell> HideMyAss: I have no idea what that means.
[07:01:13] <HideMyAss> BillCriswell, Using WebRTC i am setting media: { audio : { optional: [ {sourceId: audio_source} , {googEchoCancellation: false}, {googNoiseSuppression: false}
[07:01:41] <HideMyAss> BillCriswell, which tells Google Chrome/Canary to stop doing over smart Echo cancellation and Noise reduction to have louder audio
[07:01:54] <HideMyAss> BillCriswell, but even after applying that its not yet helping.
[07:02:14] <HideMyAss> BillCriswell, therefore, how can i in Google Chrome/Canary verify those changes are applied or not?
[07:02:34] <Trow> hi
[07:03:15] <Hooloovoo> hello
[07:03:24] <Trow> i ve been a while trying to build a tree from a dom
[07:03:35] <BillCriswell> HideMyAss: I'm not sure to be honest. Never looked into that. I'm trying to think of a better channel to ask though
[07:03:40] <Trow> could anyone help me it will nice
[07:03:46] <Trow> http://jsfiddle.net/j8wk2poj/11/
[07:04:13] <Trow> i want to have the array like the one in the bottom of the js code
[07:04:46] <HideMyAss> BillCriswell, WebRTC is the channel, but people there do not help, they are like dead and silent
[07:05:45] <BillCriswell> HideMyAss: Maybe you can try ##javascript?
[07:05:56] <HideMyAss> ok
[07:10:26] <Trow> anyone is here ?
[07:10:52] <mynameisbrian> there are 744 people here trow
[07:10:57] <BillCriswell> Trow: 744 people.
[07:11:56] <Trow> how many could give me a hand ?
[07:12:07] <Trow> http://jsfiddle.net/j8wk2poj/11/
[07:12:35] <Trow> id like to have an array similar to the one in the js
[07:12:54] <Tobbe> nodedfree: So I installed Chrome on that other computer as well, and of course it works there... So it's only on this Chromebook it doesn't work as it should. Where do I go from here?
[07:14:02] <Tobbe> at this point I'm not even sure if it's a bug in the browser, OS or jQuery. And I don't even know how to rule out one or the other
[07:16:17] <BillCriswell> Trow: This feels backwards. Wouldn't you start out with the array and end up with the HTML?
[07:17:53] <Trow> no no no id like to start with html and get json
[07:18:00] <Trow> BillCriswell,
[07:18:15] <decx> so s is just what the endproduct should look like?
[07:27:24] <BillCriswell> decx: Think that's their goal.
[07:32:36] <decx> well by now i've lost all interest BillCriswell ;)
[07:32:45] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha
[07:33:15] <BillCriswell> I'm recovering from a head ache so I'm not even attempting.
[07:33:51] <shoky> Trow: http://jsfiddle.net/j8wk2poj/12/
[07:35:42] <decx> i dont get $(this).remove().children()
[07:35:48] <decx> how does it do anything?
[07:35:59] <decx> isnt it removed before gettign to children
[07:36:17] <Trow> shoky, really thank you very much
[07:37:03] <shoky> decx yea i guess it's just working on a  detached fragment then
[07:38:21] <decx> interesting
[07:38:35] <decx> i still dont get it :>
[07:39:06] <BillCriswell> Trow: To get the path you can probably use .closest('li').children('span').text().toLowerCase() or something along those lines, might be better to put those in a data attribute or something though.
[07:39:14] <BillCriswell> decx: Glad I'm not alone haha
[07:40:25] <shoky> decx just cause something isn't in the DOM doesn't mean you cant traverse it :S
[07:40:37] <BillCriswell> Trow: Er, .parents('li').map()
[07:40:42] <shoky> e.g. $('<div>.....</div>').children()
[07:42:34] <decx> well i know that shoky but i also thought that remove() removes and detach() detaches
[07:43:52] <shoky> they both remove from the DOM. detach() just keeps the data associated with the element , in case you want to re-attach it to the DOM
[07:44:00] <shoky> so that it won't lose it's jquery data/events data
[07:44:01] <BillCriswell> decx: var $removed = $el.remove();
[07:45:14] <decx> ah
[07:45:25] <decx> the reference survives
[07:45:58] <BillCriswell> Recursion just hurts my brain sometime. Some days it makes perfect sense others I feel like I'm doing something way wrong.
[07:46:22] <decx> well you can write recursion without curse but what does that even mean
[07:46:37] <shoky> :-o
[07:47:04] <decx> sorry i looked into the spice jar early today
[07:47:27] <shoky> you're forgiven
[07:54:13] <syntaks> 'morning
[07:54:36] <syntaks>  i have a group of events that trigger on an interval, and anything else that's triggered outside of that loop has to wait for them to finish essentially
[07:54:44] <syntaks> i'm not really a jquery ninja myself but it was a requirement for the project
[07:54:49] <syntaks> and i'm unfortunately alone on it
[07:55:05] <syntaks> is it simply procedural execution that's causing this?
[07:55:18] <syntaks> should i put the interval-based events below the other code?
[07:56:31] <BillCriswell> syntaks: You can set the interval to a variable and check that before you run the events. ( If I'm understanding right ).
[07:56:50] <syntaks> hmm
[07:56:53] <syntaks> i'll give it a shot
[08:03:13] <BillCriswell> syntaks: I might not understand intervals.
[08:03:40] <syntaks> it's ok bill =)
[08:04:25] <BillCriswell> syntaks: I thought doing var interval = setInterval(function () { ... }, 1000); and then doing clearInterval(interval); would make interval like 0 or something.
[08:04:34] <BillCriswell> I mean, easy enough to get around, but still
[08:04:59] <syntaks> i'm going to see how it works out with clear
[08:06:33] <BillCriswell> syntaks: http://jsbin.com/vonaqowekuze/1/edit is along the lines of what I Was thinking.
[08:06:56] <syntaks> ahh i see
[08:07:09] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/vonaqowekuze/2/edit
[08:07:10] <syntaks> in pseudo logic it's more happening like this with what i'm doing
[08:07:16] <syntaks> the interval-based events fire off
[08:07:18] <syntaks> fetch data
[08:07:29] <syntaks> but during that time let's say a button is clicked that has an event attached to it
[08:07:32] <syntaks> it waits
[08:07:56] <BillCriswell> syntaks: Yeah. I'd store the events or an array with a way to trigger the events when the timer is up.
[08:08:22] <syntaks> i'll give it a go =)
[08:08:28] <BillCriswell> shoky: Can you store an array of events and fire them off one by one or do you need to create like an array you loop though you think?
[08:08:53] <BillCriswell> shoky: Can you just store the event objects and trigger them in some way?
[08:09:04] <syntaks> brb
[08:12:24] <Prometheian> I'm using $.load to inject some html into a '.modal-body'. The html it's injecting has knockout binding attached to it. I've tried all order variants of showing the modal, injecting the html, and calling the binding. Is there some fundamental issue with ko and dynamic html?
[08:12:38] <shoky> BillCriswell hmm i don't really understand what you guys were talking about ;p not his issue, nor your discussion, nor the relation to your jsbin or questions :P
[08:12:50] <shoky> i'll re-read ;s
[08:13:19] <BillCriswell> shoky: Basically keep a user from interacting with elements for X seconds, but store those events in an array, than after X seconds run all those events.
[08:13:43] <BillCriswell> Er, keep events from "happening"?
[08:14:14] <Prometheian> There is a javascript delay
[08:15:24] <BillCriswell> shoky: http://jsbin.com/vonaqowekuze/2/
[08:16:04] <BillCriswell> shoky: Without like: $(event.toElement).trigger(event.type);
[08:16:41] <shoky> oh you mean actually retrigger dom events
[08:16:57] <BillCriswell> That sounds about right.
[08:17:44] <BillCriswell> shoky: Thought maybe there was a clever like eventObject.trigger() haha
[08:17:52] <shoky> i don't think there's a way to mimic user events 100% by js code
[08:18:06] <shoky> browsers like to be in control of shit like that
[08:18:21] <BillCriswell> Why they gotta mess up my flava.
[08:24:43] <shoky> still don't understand the discussion or your previous questions :D
[08:25:20] <shoky> well, the first question
[08:27:00] <BillCriswell> shoky: Me either.
[08:39:56] <shoky> ;]
[08:45:22] <anderskristo> Check out this: http://johanjohansson.me/ is it working?
[08:45:46] <robertmaxrees> takes a while to load, but yeah.
[08:46:35] <robertmaxrees> woah, that background image is over a meg and a half.
[08:48:49] <effortDee_> is there any way i can load both jquery 1.6.1 and jquery 1.11.1 ?
[08:48:55] <effortDee_> as im getting errors using one or the other
[08:49:04] <robertmaxrees> effortDee_ use 1.11.1 and include jquery migrate.
[08:49:10] <robertmaxrees> see if that doesn't solve your issues.
[08:50:18] <effortDee_> i did robertmaxress
[08:50:20] <effortDee_> rees
[08:50:23] <effortDee_> it solves nearly all except one
[08:50:29] <robertmaxrees> then fix that last one.
[08:50:32] <effortDee_> jquery-ui.1.8
[08:50:34] <laka> Is it possible to run (and repeat) a separate function while executing an ajax call?
[08:50:53] <robertmaxrees> laka not sure what you mean.
[08:51:01] <effortDee_> jquery-ui.1.8.9-custom.min.js is the last error and is sporadic :S
[08:51:21] <mooncup> laka: something like while(waitingforajax) { dostuff() }
[08:51:22] <mooncup> ?
[08:51:33] <effortDee_> mooncup
[08:51:34] <effortDee_> your name
[08:51:35] <effortDee_> lol
[08:51:38] <robertmaxrees> effortDee_ figure out what's causing the error.  it's not inside of jquery, something is likely using a deprecated method.
[08:51:39] <effortDee_> howdy
[08:51:45] <effortDee_> yes trying to find it
[08:51:58] <robertmaxrees> effortDee_ http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[08:52:06] <robertmaxrees> check this out - invaluable when upgrading to post 1.9
[08:52:11] <effortDee_> i've done that
[08:52:15] <effortDee_> but will look again
[08:52:16] <effortDee_> thanks!
[08:52:20] <laka> robertmaxrees: I'm executing a form input through jquery/ajax. During this execution I want a seperate function to update a progress bar. Is this possible?
[08:52:21] <effortDee_> robertmaxrees++
[08:52:31] <laka> mooncup: yeah, sure
[08:53:07] <laka> basically something like this: http://dev.lakaweb.com/greentext/js/crawl.js
[08:53:21] <laka> don't mind the xhr stuff
[08:53:44] <mooncup> why not set a variable to true
[08:53:52] <mooncup> then do while(variable) or w/e
[08:53:58] <mooncup> then set it to false when the ajax is done
[08:54:34] <laka> it wouldn't just wait for the ajax stuff to finish? because that's the problem I have now
[08:54:56] <laka> as soon as the form is submitted, the setInterval pauses and waits for the ajax to finish
[08:55:02] <mooncup> nah the ajax stuff should be in its own thread
[08:55:14] <laka> okay, I'll test. ty
[08:56:24] <robertmaxrees> wat
[08:56:29] <robertmaxrees> javascript is single threaded.
[08:56:59] <mooncup> I'm at least 70% sure that ajax calls don't stop the flow of everything else
[08:57:08] <mooncup> I'm happy to be proven wrong tho
[08:57:13] <mooncup> brb home time
[08:57:21] <robertmaxrees> they're non-blocking, sure, because they're async, but that doesn't mean they're in another thread.
[08:57:22] <mooncup> I'll be back in 30m to find out if I'm talking shit or not
[08:57:26] <mooncup> brb
[08:57:28] <laka> so... this http://dev.lakaweb.com/greentext/js/crawl.js won't work?
[08:57:40] <laka> of course
[08:58:07] <robertmaxrees> laka what do you need the progress bar in the first place?  you're just submitting a form, right?
[08:59:38] <laka> robertmaxrees: yeah, but the form contains an URL that is crawled, which takes some time to finish.
[09:00:09] <robertmaxrees> how long?
[09:00:31] <laka> robertmaxrees: depending on the chosen data limit, like 2-3 mins
[09:02:22] <laka> but of course, it is not _that_ important. was just wondering if it was possible to do it in that way
[09:03:28] <laka> the above code does not work btw
[09:03:44] <robertmaxrees> unless you can provide some kind of status from your server, that bar is kind of meaningless.
[09:03:58] <laka> robertmaxrees: but I can, that's the point
[09:04:16] <robertmaxrees> imo if it's going to be that long, i'd set up your form to submit to the server and then set up a page where users can check status
[09:04:29] <robertmaxrees> anything over a few seconds is pushing people's patience.
[09:05:15] <Cork> laka: ajax has support for progress information
[09:05:20] <Cork> if the server can send that info
[09:05:26] <laka> exactly, that's why i'm using a progress bar
[09:05:30] <Cork> it is mainly used for file uploads though
[09:05:41] <laka> Cork: yeah, I tried using the xhr function, but it didn't work out of the box..
[09:05:42] <robertmaxrees> and 2-3 minutes is too long imo.
[09:06:00] <robertmaxrees> give them a status page to check instead.  that way the user doesn't feel like they have to sit there and wait.
[09:06:00] <Cork> laka: the server has to support sending the progress data
[09:06:32] <laka> Cork: how can I check that?
[09:07:37] <robertmaxrees> also, the progress APIs are well supported by older browsers.
[09:08:06] <Cork> laka: my memory is failing me
[09:08:16] <Cork> haven't needed it for quite some time
[09:08:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Monitoring_progress
[09:09:50] <Cork> robertmaxrees: but doesn't you need code server side too
[09:10:15] <Cork> or am i just missremembering?
[09:10:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.  that page explains it.
[09:10:47] <robertmaxrees> but the progress APIs aren't supported by IE 9 and below.
[09:11:04] <robertmaxrees> and stuff taking minutes should really have a different progress setup.
[09:11:25] <Cork> robertmaxrees: i don't see anything about the server side on that section
[09:12:06] <Cork> so ya, might remembering wrong...
[09:12:22] <robertmaxrees> how else would you know what the progress is?
[09:12:38] <Cork> number of bytes sent by the network stack
[09:12:55] <Cork> though not proof it has gotten to the other end
[09:12:56] <robertmaxrees> in this person's case I mean - the server would have to send back progress info.
[09:13:01] <robertmaxrees> i see what you're getting at though.
[09:13:39] <Cork> robertmaxrees: i meant about the process event; my memory pointed at something the server sent back for tht
[09:13:42] <Cork> *that
[09:13:47] <robertmaxrees> ah
[09:13:51] <Cork> but the page contradicts that...
[09:16:40] <laka> but back to my initial question, there is no way to have a separate function executing while waiting for a ajax call to finish?
[09:18:53] <Cork> laka: sure there is
[09:18:58] <robertmaxrees> sure there is, but that's not really what you want haha
[09:19:00] <Cork> unless you run sync ajax
[09:19:01] <laka> or do I have to implement some kind of multi-threaded stuff?
[09:19:05] <robertmaxrees> ajax is async, that's the point.
[09:19:15] <robertmaxrees> and there's no threading in js without webworkers.
[09:19:40] <Cork> ya, javascript is single threaded by spec
[09:20:25] <laka> robertmaxrees: but how then..? instead of just stating the obvious.
[09:21:08] <Cork> laka: the page can't update while the loop happens (the while loop)
[09:21:17] <Cork> you have to use timers so you let the page update
[09:21:25] <Cork> (or postMessage)
[09:21:35] <stack> does anyone knows the state of canvas.transferControlToProxy ? does it exists somewhere or it is a draft?
[09:21:58] <Cork> laka: the page is only allowed to update when the javascript stack has complete unwind
[09:22:22] <Cork> laka: so you are doing ajax calls in a loop
[09:22:32] <Cork> but the callbacks can't ever fire
[09:22:34] <Cork> or the page update
[09:22:44] <Cork> cause the while loop keeps the old stack alive
[09:24:21] <laka> Cork: ah, I see.
[09:25:34] <laka> Cork: so, is it trivial to modifiy in order to make them run simultaneously?
[09:25:47] <laka> this is basically the code I have now: http://dev.lakaweb.com/greentext/js/crawl.js
[09:25:49] <Cork> laka: not trivial
[09:25:52] <laka> okay
[09:26:04] <Cork> what you need to do is use setTimeout to trigger update checks
[09:26:04] <laka> what needs to be done, exactly?
[09:26:22] <Cork> and in the .always from the ajax request you trigger a new check
[09:27:51] <Cork> stack: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-canvas-transfercontroltoproxy
[09:32:16] <laka> Cork: but .always is only called upon completion..?
[09:32:29] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.always/
[09:32:59] <Cork> laka: yes, one call sends the post to the server
[09:33:20] <Cork> and one call periodically checks with the server what the state is of the post
[09:33:24] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of a multiple small box blind affect on hover of div?
[09:33:28] <Forbidd3n> to hide/show
[09:33:52] <Cork> laka: that or the processevent that is based on the amount of data the browser has pushed on the network
[09:34:17] <laka> Cork: with deferred.always(), like robertmaxrees suggested..?
[09:34:35] <robertmaxrees> laka i was showing when always runs :)
[09:34:40] <Cork> laka: .always or complete
[09:34:43] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax()always()
[09:34:45] <Cork> depending on how you want to write it
[09:34:54] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().always() - ajax returns a deferred object.
[09:35:00] <Cork> i usually prefer $.ajax().done().always()
[09:35:17] <Cork> over $.ajax(url, { success: function, compete: function }
[09:35:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's smarter - pointing out that you can run always() off of ajax
[09:35:35] <robertmaxrees> since I don't think laka understook what i meant by the link :)
[09:35:36] <laka> but how to run it periodically?
[09:35:45] <Cork> laka: with setTimeout
[09:35:52] <Cork> ?g mdn setTimeout
[09:35:53] <b-ot> Cork: WindowTimers.setTimeout() - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setTimeout
[09:36:00] <Cork> O_o
[09:36:03] <robertmaxrees> outside of the always.
[09:36:05] <laka> =)
[09:36:05] <Cork> WindowTimers??
[09:36:13] <robertmaxrees> !g mdn window.settimeout
[09:36:13] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: WindowTimers.setTimeout() - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setTimeout
[09:36:17] <robertmaxrees> wtf :(
[09:37:29] <laka> I don't really see the logic in this. Where exactly do I define the setTimeout(), and why do I need .always, if it is only called upon completion? :-)
[09:38:05] <robertmaxrees> .always() is to stop the timer from running.  the setTimeout() should be started after the ajax call starts.
[09:38:52] <laka> robertmaxrees: I see.
[09:39:50] <laka> ..but still not sure where to put the setTimeout()
[09:40:13] <laka> which basically boils down to my original question
[09:40:30] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ check out the callback function queues
[09:40:41] <laka> thanks
[09:40:50] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#callback-functions will show you which callbacks exist and when they run.
[09:41:22] <laka> mhm
[09:41:33] <robertmaxrees> avoid using error, success, and complete and use the comperable deferred methods instead.
[09:42:44] <laka> what is the advantage by using .always?
[09:42:59] <laka> ..instead of success or complete?
[09:43:06] <robertmaxrees> always instead of complete.
[09:43:11] <robertmaxrees> .done() instead of success.
[09:43:17] <robertmaxrees> and .fail() instead of .error()
[09:43:43] <robertmaxrees> and they use the deferreds system, which is more robust and more easily chainable.
[09:45:07] <laka> robertmaxrees: okay
[09:46:46] <Cork> robertmaxrees: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#timers
[09:46:53] <Cork> learned something new :)
[09:47:01] <Cork> (asked in mdns irc channel)
[10:05:27] <laka> Cork, robertmaxrees: hmm.. close to something? =) http://dev.lakaweb.com/greentext/js/crawl.js
[10:06:03] <Cork> laka: no quite far from
[10:06:22] <Cork> laka: first you need to call the setTimeout after the original $.ajax
[10:06:25] <robertmaxrees> you can ditch that .done() if it's empty btw.
[10:06:26] <Cork> not in its .always
[10:06:56] <Cork> laka: the .always should be used with the update_progress ajax call
[10:07:09] <Cork> so that if the call returns a none 2xx result it will try again
[10:07:30] <Cork> thirdly setTimeout takes a function reference
[10:07:35] <Cork> so no () after the function name
[10:07:51] <laka> okay, thanks
[10:08:21] <Ayub15> I have question regarding using jquery and bootstrap
[10:08:41] <Ayub15> could some one assist me in resolving the conflict ?
[10:08:42] <robertmaxrees> ask away.
[10:08:57] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Ayub15
[10:08:57] <b-ot> Ayub15: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:09:28] <Ayub15> Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: supplier-button
[10:09:58] <Ayub15> I get that error when using jquery ui select menu
[10:10:10] <robertmaxrees> could you share your code in a fixee?
[10:10:18] <Ayub15> sure
[10:10:21] <laka> Cork: where do I call the setTimeout _after_ the ajax call?
[10:10:51] <Cork> laka: $.ajax(); setTimeout(update_process, 1000);
[10:11:30] <laka> Cork: thought I was doing that by putting it in .always
[10:11:34] <laka> but okay
[10:11:41] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: http://fixee.org/paste/lupmkxj/
[10:11:43] <robertmaxrees> laka .always() runs when everything finishes.
[10:11:51] <robertmaxrees> and the requests have completed/errored/whatever
[10:12:12] <laka> yeah, but isn't that kind of the same thing as "after"?
[10:12:13] <Cork> laka: always is a callback, after just runs after the ajax call has been scheduled
[10:12:17] <Cork> no
[10:12:19] <laka> okay
[10:12:34] <Cork> console.log(1); console.log(2);
[10:12:39] <Cork> that is "after"
[10:12:51] <robertmaxrees> Ayub15 don't do $('[id$=supplier]') - give the elements you want a class and select on that instead.
[10:12:54] <Cork> always is "when you've gotten a response back from the server do this"
[10:13:16] <laka> sure, okay
[10:13:29] <robertmaxrees> *when the requests all finished, regardless of status.
[10:13:29] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: could you give example ?
[10:13:38] <laka> mhm
[10:14:23] <Ayub15> $('[id$=supplier]') works withou bootstrap
[10:14:35] <robertmaxrees> Ayub15 that's a really slow selector.
[10:14:51] <Ayub15> ok
[10:14:51] <robertmaxrees> give the elements you want to run that against a class instead.
[10:14:53] <robertmaxrees> select that class.
[10:15:55] <Ayub15> ok, got you..however even if its slow the issue is conflict with bootstrap
[10:16:06] <thinkxl> remove bootstrap
[10:16:07] <thinkxl> boom!
[10:16:08] <robertmaxrees> see if that change doesn't resolve the conflict.
[10:16:10] <thinkxl> fixed
[10:16:31] <Ayub15> ok
[10:16:32] <thinkxl> ups, I thought I was in frontend
[10:16:36] <thinkxl> lol, sorry
[10:16:40] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha,
[10:20:16] <Ayub15> $( ".supplier" ).selectmenu() same error
[10:20:31] <robertmaxrees> do you have any other relevant code?
[10:21:14] <Ayub15> no this error I see when I change item in select error
[10:21:37] <robertmaxrees> could you share your html and js
[10:21:37] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:22:20] <Ayub15> ok..its xhtml file
[10:22:34] <Ayub15> with bootstrap
[10:22:36] <robertmaxrees> just the relevant markup is all that's needed.
[10:22:44] <robertmaxrees> you could also make a fiddle.
[10:23:28] <Ayub15> ok
[10:30:20] <laka> Cork, robertmaxrees: it seems to be working now, but the ajax call isn't executed. any obvious reason why?
[10:30:30] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[10:30:32] <robertmaxrees> network errors?
[10:30:33] <laka> (the second ajax call)
[10:30:36] <laka> no, none
[10:30:42] <Cork> laka: code
[10:31:00] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/5gerh4ck/ I am using jsf + bootstrap +jquery
[10:31:04] <laka> http://dev.lakaweb.com/greentext/js/crawl.js
[10:31:28] <Cork> laka: it should trigger once
[10:31:32] <Cork> but .always(setTimeout(update_progress, 3000)) is wrong
[10:31:41] <Cork> .always(function() { setTimeout(update_progress, 3000) })
[10:32:06] <Ayub15> if I remove $( '[id$=supplier]' ).selectmenu(); I see select menu without jquery styling..
[10:32:50] <robertmaxrees> what version of bootstrap are you using?
[10:34:16] <robertmaxrees> Ayub15 wait, you included jquery ui in your codebase as well, right?
[10:34:34] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: yes, I have included
[10:34:49] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: I am using Bootstrap v3.2.0
[10:35:27] <robertmaxrees> and what version of jquery ui?
[10:35:42] <laka> Cork: didn't seem to help. all ajax calls to progress.php are just queued, seemingly
[10:35:52] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: jQuery UI - v1.11.1
[10:36:08] <robertmaxrees> Ayub15 -> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5gerh4ck/1/
[10:36:10] <robertmaxrees> it works fine here.
[10:36:51] <Cork> laka: btw you call the setTimeout twice in the initial ajax call
[10:37:00] <Cork> (once in beforeSend and once after)
[10:37:09] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: I get error  when I change the select element
[10:37:16] <Cork> laka: is the alert triggering?
[10:37:49] <Cork> laka: also alerts mess up events, don't use it for debugging
[10:37:54] <Cork> use console.log instead
[10:38:11] <laka> okay, thanks
[10:38:59] <robertmaxrees> Ayub15 your markup doens't make any sense.  do you have a custom DTD or something?
[10:39:20] <laka> Cork: the alert is triggered if I have .always(setTimeout(update_progress, 3000));
[10:39:23] <Ayub15> no
[10:39:30] <laka> and not if I change it to what you wrote
[10:39:39] <robertmaxrees> Ayub15 then your markup is invalid - fix that part first.
[10:39:45] <Cork> laka: did you forget to write the function around that?
[10:39:47] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: ok
[10:39:56] <Cork> laka: cause that code won't work
[10:40:00] <robertmaxrees> check to make sure that what's getting rendered is actual HTML.
[10:40:04] <laka> Cork: no, I wrote exactly the same as you
[10:40:10] <Cork> laka: no
[10:40:23] <Cork> i wrote .always(function() { setTimeout(update_progress, 3000) });
[10:41:52] <laka> Cork: yes, I know. That doesn't trigger the function, but without the function around it - it does. :/
[10:42:08] <robertmaxrees> laka it's triggering it immediately - that's not what you want.
[10:42:14] <Cork> laka: without the function around it it will just execute directly
[10:42:31] <robertmaxrees> that's evaluating and running the function right away and passing the return value to the setTimeout() call, which isn't what you want.
[10:42:59] <Cork> so without the function you pass the reference number from setTimeout to .always
[10:42:59] <laka> well, then I don't know what to tell you. it works seemingly without the function around it, and it is not called immediately
[10:43:02] <Cork> instead of a function
[10:43:12] <Cork> laka: it is
[10:43:17] <Cork> directly + the 3 sec
[10:43:23] <laka> ah, okay
[10:43:25] <robertmaxrees> laka it fires the timer immediately.
[10:43:31] <Cork> instead of, when the response comes back + 3 sec
[10:43:38] <laka> mhm

[10:44:18] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: http://fixee.org/paste/5s1tpuo/ is the actual html rendered
[10:45:04] <boombadaroomba> trying to grab the input name. cany anyone take a quick glace to point me in the right direction?
[10:45:05] <boombadaroomba> http://jsfiddle.net/hfm9z0hb/4/
[10:45:30] <blue_warlock> hello people
[10:45:39] <robertmaxrees> boombadaroomba use .prop() not .attr()
[10:45:48] <boombadaroomba> thank you
[10:45:56] <blue_warlock> does somebody know how to launch a self closure on shadowbox ?
[10:46:14] <blue_warlock> need to close it via script load
[10:46:20] <OmicroN__> so does jquery ui droppable only accept items from jquery ui draggable? and is there a way like around that
[10:47:34] <robertmaxrees> Ayub15 your issue is that you have colons in attribute values.
[10:47:48] <robertmaxrees> so figure out a way to render those without the colons.
[10:47:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5gerh4ck/2/ <- no errors.
[10:48:10] <robertmaxrees> blue_warlock not sure what you're asking.
[10:48:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to close what via script load?
[10:49:07] <blue_warlock> need to autoclose fekin shadow box window after some code load
[10:49:14] <Ayub15> robertmaxrees: you might be correct..
[10:49:39] <blue_warlock> i open a form in SBox after submission if all is ok it must autoclose
[10:49:51] <Ayub15> colons are introduced by JSF and JSF + jquery UI works..however if I introduce bootstrap it breaks
[10:50:07] <robertmaxrees> Ayub15 right, because bootstrap is trying to select things with colons in them, which breaks.
[10:50:18] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ blue_warlock
[10:50:19] <b-ot> blue_warlock: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:50:29] <blue_warlock> have tried document.ready (fnc{Shadowbox.close()}
[10:51:01] <robertmaxrees> document.ready (fnc{Shadowbox.close()} that's... not valid lol
[10:51:23] <blue_warlock> i know mna
[10:51:25] <blue_warlock> man
[10:51:45] <robertmaxrees> erm, how can I help if I don't know what you're working with then?
[10:51:45] <blue_warlock> >$( document ).ready(function() {Shadowbox.close();});
[10:52:01] <robertmaxrees> what happens when you do that?
[10:52:02] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[10:52:24] <blue_warlock> moment let me check console
[10:52:51] <blue_warlock> no errors at all
[10:53:04] <blue_warlock> but the window doest close
[10:54:54] <robertmaxrees> and Shadowbox is defined at that point?
[10:55:02] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might have a scoping issue.
[10:55:02] <blue_warlock> i found something
[10:55:06] <blue_warlock> window.parent.Shadowbox.close();
[10:55:19] <robertmaxrees> O.o that's... hacky.
[10:55:20] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[10:55:26] <blue_warlock> let me try
[10:55:28] <blue_warlock> XD
[10:55:48] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need that .parent bit in there.
[10:56:04] <robertmaxrees> unless you're doing something really unusual
[10:56:08] <blue_warlock> sbox is opened in iframe
[10:56:24] <blue_warlock> im using to add categories on the fly
[10:56:33] <robertmaxrees> then you need to target the .contents() of the iframe.
[10:59:26] <blue_warlock> it works !
[11:01:58] <laka> robertmaxrees, Cork: the function is only called once, but the ajax call is seemingly never executed
[11:02:14] <robertmaxrees> laka look at your network panel.  what do you see?
[11:02:44] <laka> robertmaxrees: I see the ajax call as "pending"
[11:03:19] <robertmaxrees> because there's no response...
[11:03:28] <robertmaxrees> that means the ajax is executing.
[11:03:58] <laka> ah, okay. that's strange
[11:04:03] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[11:04:14] <kevin> hey guys. how can a selector include the root? for example, i have a variable `fields` that is "<select ...><option>...</option>...</select>" and i would like to include the SELECT element in my selector. thoughts?
[11:04:14] <laka> oh?
[11:04:25] <robertmaxrees> you're making the question - nothing else for the ajax happens because nothing of note has happened.
[11:04:44] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ kevin
[11:04:44] <b-ot> kevin: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:05:06] <laka> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[11:05:20] <robertmaxrees> laka the ajax request runs - it sends the request to the server.
[11:06:23] <robertmaxrees> that's all that's happened.  the request hasn't failed or succeeded, so none of the callbacks can really run...
[11:06:23] <laka> robertmaxrees: yeah, I understand that. And it does get a response if I run it separately
[11:06:34] <robertmaxrees> how are you running it "Separately"?
[11:06:35] <kevin> robertmaxrees, okay well then http://jsfiddle.net/7uwkhcnL/
[11:06:45] <laka> but the php file is sending a response?
[11:06:55] <robertmaxrees> laka your network panel isn't lying to you.
[11:07:26] <laka> hehe, I know
[11:07:26] <robertmaxrees> kevin so you want the fields var to include both the select element AND the options?
[11:08:28] <laka> robertmaxrees: but if I just write update_progress() without it being called after the first ajax call, it works like a sharm
[11:08:39] <laka> *charm
[11:08:51] <kevin> robertmaxrees, i would like my "*[id]" selector to select children that have an `id` attribute (in this case, none because option has no id) as well as the root if it has an `id` attribute (in this case, the select)
[11:09:08] <robertmaxrees> kevin erm, 2 things.
[11:09:22] <robertmaxrees> first, that's really slow and hacky.
[11:09:24] <laka> robertmaxrees: so it doesn't seem to be a problem with the ajax call/response
[11:09:49] <robertmaxrees> kevin attribute selectors aren't really a great thing to do.  second: why would you want to do that?
[11:10:44] <kevin> robertmaxrees, i'm doing some dynamic field generation and cloning. the "templates" have IDs in them, and when I clone them, I am manipulating the IDs of the cloned elements
[11:10:53] <kevin> am i going about this the wrong way?
[11:10:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:11:06] <robertmaxrees> could you expand your example a little?
[11:11:13] <kevin> k one sec
[11:11:21] <robertmaxrees> because $('#selCounty') should be all you need.
[11:16:41] <laka> robertmaxrees: are you sure the first ajax call doesn't mess up the other?
[11:17:14] <robertmaxrees> sorry, are you making multiple requests?  will your server accommodate that?
[11:17:24] <robertmaxrees> *multiple, simultaneous requests
[11:17:36] <laka> robertmaxrees: well, yes? :-)
[11:17:48] <laka> robertmaxrees: I don't know.. will it?
[11:18:42] <robertmaxrees> i can't answer that question for you...
[11:19:51] <laka> yes I am making multiple requests, but I don't know if the server will allow it. I haven't done anything to make it so
[11:20:02] <robertmaxrees> could you share your code again?
[11:20:18] <laka> http://dev.lakaweb.com/greentext/js/crawl.js
[11:21:05] <kevin> robertmaxrees, okay this is a bit expanded: http://jsfiddle.net/7uwkhcnL/1/ ... if you can see, the cloned <select> doesn't get its id changed, but the inside input does, because the "[id] selector isnt including the select
[11:21:44] <kevin> the "*[id]" selector*
[11:22:06] <robertmaxrees> laka http://fixee.org/paste/1quaya3/ try this.
[11:22:13] <robertmaxrees> see if you get that progress log every 3 seconds.
[11:22:32] <robertmaxrees> kevinfagan first off, don't use .attr()
[11:22:36] <robertmaxrees> especially for values.
[11:22:38] <robertmaxrees> use .val()
[11:22:50] <robertmaxrees> for data attributes, use .data()
[11:22:57] <laka> robertmaxrees: thanks, 2 sec
[11:23:19] <robertmaxrees> woops, meant just kevin
[11:23:38] <robertmaxrees> also, $("*[id]", template).each(function() { is not what you want.
[11:24:40] <laka> robertmaxrees: only once :-/
[11:24:46] <robertmaxrees> laka and never again?
[11:24:51] <kevin> robertmaxrees, whoops ii just realized that's not how i am doing it actually. i clone the template first, then modify the cloned elements , if that matters
[11:25:00] <laka> robertmaxrees: no, just that first time
[11:25:08] <robertmaxrees> kevin did you read anything else i put?
[11:25:18] <robertmaxrees> laka ... right, because you're using a setTimeout.
[11:25:22] <robertmaxrees> that'll run once.
[11:25:34] <kevin> yes robertmaxrees, i thought for some reason you couldn't change the option's values using .val()  but i just tried it and it works. thanks
[11:25:45] <robertmaxrees> also the bit about data...
[11:25:52] <robertmaxrees> and finally, your each is bad.
[11:26:13] <robertmaxrees> use .closest() to explicitly get the parent element that you want.
[11:27:44] <robertmaxrees> laka you want setInterval instead.
[11:28:05] <kevin> robertmaxrees,  okay got it about data. i didnt know that got the data-* attributes. just thought it was to attach data (strings, objects, etc) to elements.
[11:28:11] <laka> robertmaxrees: ah, okay. but even so, the second ajax call is still pending..?
[11:28:23] <robertmaxrees> laka you'll need to check your server config at that point.
[11:28:34] <robertmaxrees> kevin yep, but you want to use .data() because it's faster.
[11:28:38] <robertmaxrees> accesses a cached version.
[11:29:09] <kevin> okay, makes sense. and which each? i'm not sure how .closest() would help
[11:29:29] <laka> robertmaxrees: setInterval worked. =) you happen to know which setting?
[11:29:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:29:38] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:29:42] <robertmaxrees> laka your server is your server...
[11:29:53] <robertmaxrees> kevin     $("*[id]", template).each( function() { this one.
[11:29:57] <laka> okay, thanks anyways
[11:30:19] <robertmaxrees> kevin basically, your selectors are really strange.
[11:30:57] <kevin> robertmaxrees, so how would you go about changing the id of all elements inside the cloned template?
[11:31:17] <robertmaxrees> start by changing var template = $("> *", "#" + $(this).data("template") );, to var template = $("#" + $(this).data("template") );
[11:32:02] <kevin> okay, makes sense. so you would get the template element itself, and not all of its children
[11:32:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:32:21] <robertmaxrees> you can then select the children by doing template.find('.whateverYouWant');
[11:34:15] <kevin> well, the template itself can have multiple children. i don't want to add the template itself to the DOM, so that's why i thought i had to do "> *" (to get direct children), which i guess i could also use template.children() though
[11:34:30] <robertmaxrees> or use .find() to get the ones you want.
[11:34:48] <robertmaxrees> either/or
[11:34:58] <kevin> well, i want all of the children...?
[11:35:04] <robertmaxrees> then .children() is fine.
[11:35:21] <robertmaxrees> .find() is great if you have a selector to work with.  it'll get all descendents that match that selector.
[11:35:32] <kevin> okay. so now how would you go about changing the IDs? thats why i thought *[id] to select all elements that have an id is necessary
[11:36:21] <robertmaxrees> could you update the fiddle with what you have so far?
[11:40:10] <kevin> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/7uwkhcnL/2/ so everything is working now, but if you have a different suggestion on how to change the ids, i'm all ears
[11:45:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7uwkhcnL/4/ something like this.
[11:47:02] <boombadaroomba> im having an issue where it is turning my regex for #s into a string, anyway to convert it to a integer? http://jsfiddle.net/hfm9z0hb/5/
[11:47:46] <kevin> robertmaxrees, the filter() on children() would only change the IDs of direct descendants though. i see that the select has its id changed but not the inputs
[11:48:42] <bloodyscythe> isn't it treated as an integer if you put a + before the $?
[11:48:44] <doug_> boombadaroomba: use parseInt or +:   parseInt(someString, 10)    or     +someString
[11:49:15] <robertmaxrees> explicitly convert it to a number.
[11:49:17] <boombadaroomba> doug_: thank you. that fixed it
[11:49:19] <robertmaxrees> implicit conversions are funky.
[11:49:35] <boombadaroomba> bloodyscythe: not sure, im no expert, im just a newb
[11:49:43] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7uwkhcnL/6/ kevin then like this?
[11:50:00] <bloodyscythe> me too ;)
[11:50:28] <doug_> robertmaxrees: in what case can + not do the right thing? other than octal thing
[11:50:48] <robertmaxrees> it's just not explicit.  it's one of those tricks that confuse people.
[11:51:07] <doug_> js> print(+"010")
[11:51:18] <b-ot> doug_: 10
[11:51:59] <doug_> js> print(+"010")-1
[11:52:04] <b-ot> doug_: 10
[11:52:08] <doug_> js> print(+"010"-1)
[11:52:11] <doug_> oops :(
[11:52:13] <b-ot> doug_: 9
[11:52:34] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1789952/923919 - the comment "Writing code that is unreadable because it's full of tricks isn't "bad ass" so much as just "bad"" illustrates the point.
[11:52:42] <kevin> robertmaxrees, okay that makes sense. but why would finding all children via "*" and then filtering based off the presence of an id property in javascript be faster than using the pure CSS selector of *[id] ?
[11:53:00] <doug_> robertmaxrees: tricks are one thing, but a generally accepted shorthand isn't always a bad thing
[11:53:01] <robertmaxrees> kevin because the selector does some funky parsing of the dom.
[11:53:11] <robertmaxrees> doug_ i don't accept that shorthand here ;)
[11:53:27] <robertmaxrees> kevin the other one reduced the working set to something smaller, and the works with the dom in more sane ways.
[12:00:58] <doug_> robertmaxrees: your coding guidelines require calling Number to cast it then?
[12:01:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.  parseInt() suffices.
[12:02:10] <robertmaxrees> or parseFloat(), depending on what you need.
[12:02:25] <doug_> parseInt has weird semantics though
[12:02:35] <doug_> without radix
[12:02:48] <robertmaxrees> it can, which is why we then say that you should supply the radix always.
[12:04:01] <kevin> robertmaxrees, i see what you're saying there, and i understand it, but i don't get what/how the selector "does some funky parsing of the dom" .. how is it funky? is there any docs or something that suggest "use filter over * because xyz" . not that i doubt you, i just wonder where this is stated. just seems to be pure, standard CSS would be faster than running a javascript function on all elements *shrug*
[12:04:19] <kevin> seems to me*
[12:04:20] <robertmaxrees> it's not *, it's the attribute selectors.
[12:04:21] <doug_> why not use parser
[12:04:25] <doug_> oops
[12:04:40] <doug_> why not use selector? then the native code of the browser can do the filtering quickly
[12:05:42] <doug_> anyway - you should use data attributes to store data, and NEVER the id
[12:05:58] <robertmaxrees> they're selecting elements that have an ID.
[12:06:14] <robertmaxrees> and then using data attributes to store an id reference to another element.
[12:06:28] <robertmaxrees> hrm, i must be confused.  i coulda sworn attribute selectors had performance problems.  must have them mixed up with something else.
[12:06:30] <robertmaxrees> carry on.
[12:06:38] * kevin shrugs
[12:06:56] <doug_> robertmaxrees: that was true in the past for sure. now though, we have new ways of asking the browser for elements...
[12:07:07] <robertmaxrees> but old browsers are still old browsers ;)
[12:07:13] <doug_> I'm not saying either way is faster though, but pre-optimizing is a bad idea though
[12:07:16] <robertmaxrees> i have to support back to IE8, so I regularly have to consider those things.
[12:07:27] <robertmaxrees> and i'd disagree that's pre-optimizing.
[12:14:23] <doug_> robertmaxrees: I do love that chained pipeline style of coding though :)
[12:14:56] <robertmaxrees> my latest coding style has focused on writing functions as purely as possible.
[12:15:17] <robertmaxrees> so i actually wind up avoiding doing that sort of chaining in the first place.
[12:17:29] <doug_> robertmaxrees: you can make jquery plugins to add your own reusable pipeline stages.
[12:17:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware.
[12:18:14] <robertmaxrees> we've done that with a few things here, but our application has some... interesting considerations. and i'm not a fan of always doing tons of method chaining.
[12:18:17] <doug_> yes I'm sure you are - just thinking out loud
[12:18:23] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:40:24] <Respek> question, I know $("input:disabled") finds all disabled elements, but would this.$DisabledElement = this.$elem.find("input:disabled"); work in the same way?
[12:40:55] <Respek> and also set the disabled objects to a variable, I'm thinking
[12:40:56] <shoky> Respek: yup
[12:40:57] <doug_> Respek: yes
[12:41:13] <Respek> great! Thanks all :) love this room :D
[12:41:17] <doug_> Respek: $('foo') literally calls find('foo')
[12:41:25] <Respek> oh!
[12:41:48] <doug_> so utterly identical behavior
[12:41:59] * Respek Buys doug_ and shoky a beer
[12:42:03] <Respek> :D
[12:44:04] <doug_> yes, this is one of the most civil IRC rooms I've ever seen
[12:44:45] <doug_> very few people here trying to prove that they are awesome and you are an ass :D
[12:45:30] <doug_> and that you... :D
[12:46:41] <doug_> kevin: oh and for my last 2 cents on your template thing: try angularjs and be a happy person
[12:47:12] <doug_> kevin: it makes template stuff an absolute breeze
[12:53:16] <Respek> !api .extend
[12:53:16] <b-ot> Respek: No matches.
[12:53:23] <Respek> hm
[12:54:22] <Respek> !api jquery.extend
[12:54:22] <b-ot> Respek: jQuery.extend(): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[13:12:30] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can help with taking a square image and rotate vertical fade out?
[13:12:45] <Forbidd3n> so the image goes from [..] to |
[13:13:43] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: with CSS transitions it would be pretty easy.
[13:14:05] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: I tried and was having no success. trying to do it with jquery animate with css
[13:15:01] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: could you show a quick simple example if you have the time and don't mind doing it, please?
[13:15:43] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: http://jsbin.com/qinipoxotina/1/edit?html,css,output this?
[13:16:14] <Forbidd3n> kind of, but instead of rotate up it would go left to right
[13:16:18] <Forbidd3n> [..] to |
[13:17:54] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: http://jsbin.com/qinipoxotina/2/edit?css,output
[13:18:32] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: close, but left to right or right to left not left and right to center
[13:19:01] <BillCriswell> -90
[13:19:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:20:22] <BillCriswell> I think.
[13:20:55] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: Trying to get this similiar effect - https://www.dropbox.com/s/hb6vtjgscdy7v0i/AnimationTest.mov?dl=0
[13:22:01] <Forbidd3n> I have it fading the squares, can't seem to get it to do the blind fold effect
[13:22:12] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: That thing I coded randomly looks like it's showing up again haha
[13:22:20] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[13:22:21] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++
[13:22:29] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n did you get that video from a site yourself?
[13:22:58] <Forbidd3n> that is one my client created and supplied to me
[13:23:04] <Respek> trying to set a click event on a disabled item, that's ok right? no gotchas there, right?
[13:23:27] <robertmaxrees> Respek no gotcha, but it'll work even if it's disabled.
[13:23:32] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n can they send you the link instead?
[13:23:34] <Respek> hm
[13:23:36] <robertmaxrees> so you can see how that site did it?
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> Respek you probably want to bind to the change event instead.
[13:23:53] <decx> for every image you have 6 subcontainers overlayed that do the flip, it's a mess
[13:23:59] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: it isn't a site it is a video they made to show the example of what they want - I am building the site
[13:24:26] <Forbidd3n> decx: I have something similiar already working
[13:24:28] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n erm, so they took the time to create a video that illustrates what they want?  they didn't find that on some preexisting site?
[13:24:29] <BillCriswell> decx: That's what I was thinking.
[13:24:34] <shoky> click on disabled triggers the event?
[13:24:39] <shoky> hm
[13:24:55] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't it?
[13:25:03] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: yes, they are video people not web people - this is how they show me the effects they want
[13:25:18] <shoky> i dunno, i guess i'm remembering wrong
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> no way.
[13:25:51] <robertmaxrees> you're right.
[13:25:58] <robertmaxrees> wtf.  second time today my mind has been blown.
[13:26:05] <shoky> hah
[13:26:13] <Forbidd3n> decx, BillCriswell: this is kind of what I have already, jsut have to get the transition down
[13:26:32] <robertmaxrees> i feel like disabled shouldn't prevent clicking from working.
[13:26:36] <robertmaxrees> but I'm weird and/or crazy./
[13:27:02] <shoky> yea me too, i forgot the reasons
[13:27:27] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/yk417e9a/ might be useful to you.
[13:28:06] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: thanks, but I have that working already it is the hover effect that I am having an issue with
[13:28:10] <doug_> robertmaxrees: of course it disables click. you expected disabled to only affect appearance?
[13:28:21] <robertmaxrees> i expected it to only impact change.
[13:28:22] <robertmaxrees> not click.
[13:28:37] <doug_> ah
[13:29:02] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: I can't think of a way to do it without a bunch of extra elements.
[13:29:33] <robertmaxrees> of course I wouldn't expect disabled to only modify appearance.  I'm not THAT dumb ;)
[13:29:38] <doug_> lol
[13:29:43] <Forbidd3n> you mean nested divs - one for each square
[13:30:37] <BillCriswell> Wonder if you could do something dirty with gradients and animate them.
[13:30:41] <Forbidd3n> I was thinking of creating one div with nested div's clone and overlap each individual section
[13:31:17] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: A .gif might be the safest, best performing way haha
[13:31:30] <Forbidd3n> lol, I thought about that too
[13:31:56] <Forbidd3n> don't want to create a gif for each image
[13:32:05] <BillCriswell> You wouldn't need to.
[13:32:05] <Forbidd3n> not the most efficient way to do it
[13:32:23] <shoky> http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#enabling-and-disabling-form-controls:-the-disabled-attribute
[13:32:28] <shoky> "A form control that is disabled must prevent any click events that are queued on the user interaction task source from being dispatched on the element."
[13:32:33] <BillCriswell> A white and transparent image over top of the image Forbidd3n.
[13:32:48] <robertmaxrees> shoky interesting.
[13:32:50] <BillCriswell> It would be like 50px by 1px, repeat.
[13:32:53] <Forbidd3n> the image is on top of a div, when you hover over the image blinds out - like example - shows text div below
[13:33:57] <shoky> makes some sense for buttons, not much for text inputs/selects
[13:34:08] <BillCriswell> I see a white image sliding over a background image from the left?
[13:34:27] <robertmaxrees> true
[13:36:21] <Forbidd3n> the RDIO music festival is going to be a div with text
[13:36:39] <Forbidd3n> the text will be dynamic
[13:37:06] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Understood.
[13:40:23] <decx> dynamic text in a blinds effect? yikes
[13:40:52] <decx> at least with an image you can just have a few containers with background-image/position
[13:41:21] <decx> clone() content 6 times, hf making that smooth
[13:44:24] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/9v532sx5/ very hasty, but I think if the red is a tiny gif that does the blinds that'll get you pretty damn close.
[13:44:54] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/9v532sx5/1/
[13:55:29] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: still there? this is what I have thus far - http://jsfiddle.net/7sd2ezbj/1/
[13:55:29] <BillCriswell> decx: gifs all day.
[13:56:24] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: I feel like that's way more complicated than it would need to be.
[13:56:42] <Forbidd3n> It probably is, I just can't seem to find it
[13:57:47] <Forbidd3n> well the script takes the image and sets it as bg and then creates tiles for x and y numbers set
[13:57:55] <Forbidd3n> then I am trying to animate each tile
[13:59:36] <Respek> Hm, I haven't figured out that UX thing yet, so I made a fiddle and added comments to add context, any thoughts on why the click event won't trigger a console log? http://jsfiddle.net/Gabrielmtn/hjyb4jt4/
[14:00:46] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/9v532sx5/2/ just imagine this hilariously weird awkward horse as a gif that loops once and you repeat x and y.
[14:00:53] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/9v532sx5/3/ *
[14:01:27] <BillCriswell> Ah, gifs do some weird things as well. Might have to reassign the background image on each hover.
[14:02:03] <BillCriswell> each mouse enter*
[14:02:25] <BillCriswell> Hm, not even sure you can easily.
[14:02:27] <BillCriswell> Blah oh well
[14:02:32] <BillCriswell> HAve fun I'm going home!
[14:04:27] <Forbidd3n> thanks
[14:04:29] <Forbidd3n> later
[14:06:44] <decx> aw i'm late

[14:06:53] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:11:21] <jwowwz> does anyone know a good plugin that i can use to make somthing  this ? http://tinypic.com/r/jqkpr9/8
[14:11:31] <robertmaxrees> a carousel?
[14:12:08] <Respek> cycle?
[14:12:13] <jwowwz> cycle?
[14:12:33] <Respek> ^ what (s)he said
[14:13:01] <jwowwz> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[14:13:03] <jwowwz> ?
[14:15:58] <Respek> Hey, I build a plugin (70 lines) to create a bit of UX for forms, essentially adding a wobble if the person clicks a disabled field. I can't get line 49 console.log to run on click though! Thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/Gabrielmtn/hjyb4jt4/
[14:16:11] <decx> Forbidd3n http://jsfiddle.net/decx/hspz6rmb/
[14:16:31] <Respek> ooooh nice
[14:16:40] <decx> oh Respek
[14:16:43] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:16:44] <robertmaxrees> apropos!
[14:16:44] <decx> did you do that coin fall thing?
[14:16:51] <robertmaxrees> Respek because disabled elements don't emit click events.
[14:16:51] <Respek> hmm lemme see
[14:16:58] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/z3roj35k/1/
[14:17:09] <Respek> robertmaxrees: oh ok!
[14:17:30] <Respek> omg so much better than mine
[14:17:37] <Respek> I'm jealous
[14:18:39] <Respek> mine has a dumb snowflake plugin as a base: http://jsfiddle.net/Gabrielmtn/rcy78aqy/
[14:19:18] <decx> the code is pretty straight forward, if you have questions ask away
[14:19:31] <dave_4> ok this is what i'm trying to achieve whenever you click on parent menu item then only the sub menu of clicked item should toggle, currently all parent menu item which have .menu-item-has-children  class is being toggled any idea on this  see here http://technocia.com/side-bar-menu-test/
[14:19:43] <Respek> so cool!
[14:20:24] <tocka> hi, my question might sound a bit stupid but.. Does anyone know where to find some menu animations? By that I mean that the menus (li elements) would appear one by one nicely when the page loads :|
[14:20:58] <Respek> daneden.github.io/animate.css/ with https://github.com/matthieua/WOW
[14:21:01] <Respek> not stupid at all!
[14:21:06] <Respek> happy to help :)
[14:21:09] <tocka> thank you!
[14:21:13] <tocka> darghhhh
[14:21:18] <tocka> i had animte.css in bookmarks!
[14:21:21] <tocka> thanks again! :)
[14:21:26] <Respek> yw, lmk If I can help
[14:21:51] <Respek> here's another if you want something a bit more straightforward anijs.github.io
[14:22:08] <Respek> @tocka I'm here till the turn of the hour :)
[14:22:19] <tocka> hehey! :D
[14:22:23] <tocka> ok thanks:)
[14:22:26] <tocka> much love <3
[14:23:16] <Respek> back atcha, this room is full of love! check out what decx made, I'm so impressed! Was asking about how to do it for a easter egg on a site http://jsfiddle.net/z3roj35k/1/
[14:25:16] <Respek> decx: I was thrown by the png (thought animated pngs weren't a thing) is this called sprites?
[14:25:43] <decx> yes
[14:26:03] <decx> you can use the same technique in css only
[14:26:13] <LucaS05> hi. i'm using jquery to send data to a php script. The data comes from another ajax call (that works) and i'm sending the results of this call with this script http://pastebin.com/utjee74u
[14:26:13] <decx> animation with steps
[14:26:30] <LucaS05> but when i use $_POST["shipments"] it isn't set
[14:26:38] <LucaS05> what i'm doing wrong?
[14:28:02] <robertmaxrees> LucaS05 are you trying to ask how to access post data in php?
[14:28:26] <LucaS05> i want to know if that ajax call is correct
[14:29:00] <LucaS05> i've some doubts about the data: { shipments : mainData } part
[14:29:07] <robertmaxrees> that should work.
[14:30:35] <Respek> lol robertmaxrees, just throwing a little php knowhow in there too?
[14:30:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:30:45] <robertmaxrees> i know nothing about php.
[14:30:51] <Respek> also, thanks for the advice on the no click events :)
[14:30:58] <robertmaxrees> and it's technically OT for the channel so y'know ;)
[14:31:00] <robertmaxrees> and np./
[14:31:42] * Respek adds another notch to the robertmaxrees beer list carved into the table leg.
[14:31:56] <decx> *table breaks*
[14:32:27] <Respek> !api mouseover
[14:32:27] <b-ot> Respek: .mouseover(): Bind an event handler to the "mouseover" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[14:32:40] <Respek> decx: haha
[14:33:05] * Respek creates acerbic wit table leg for decx
[14:33:19] <doug_> Forbidd3n: here's my first stab at a cross-browser blinds fader http://jsfiddle.net/zw2vbzpf/6/
[14:33:32] <doug_> breaks up the image into several divs that each display a small part of the image
[14:33:40] <Respek> decx: nevermind, that's a pejorative
[14:33:46] <Forbidd3n> doug_: doesn't work
[14:33:47] <Respek> decx: that was very funny
[14:34:10] <doug_> Forbidd3n: ? it doesn't fade yet... just generates the dom elements that have each part of the image
[14:34:17] <Forbidd3n> oh sorry
[14:34:40] <doug_> each part would need to be a slider
[14:34:48] <decx> doug_ http://jsfiddle.net/decx/hspz6rmb/
[14:35:30] <Forbidd3n> decx: has to be broken up into small squares
[14:35:33] <Forbidd3n> squares
[14:36:15] <decx> the video had blinds
[14:38:02] <doug_> decx: nice and simple. doesn't quite recreate the desired effect but gets most of the way there
[14:38:28] * Respek creates a decx table leg for beer notches :) 
[14:38:38] <doug_> perhaps break that effect into 3 separate rows then stagger the start of the animation
[14:38:44] <Respek> there, now it'll definitely break
[14:38:44] <doug_> or n separate rows
[14:39:45] <decx> well you could have a mouseover event on .img and flip the e.target .sub, when 30% have flipped then flip all
[14:40:46] <Respek> robertmaxrees: do disabled event not have hover or mouseenter events either?
[14:41:02] <robertmaxrees> disabled inputs you mean?  should be a quick jsfiddle to check.
[14:41:11] <Respek> will do
[14:41:32] <robertmaxrees> though what sort of events would you need on a disabled input?
[14:41:53] <Respek> tried on click, didn't work.
[14:42:09] <Respek> basically: a little UX plugin, for having a dropdown wobble if someone tries to click a disabled text field ahead of selecting a topic from the dropdown list, which will un-disable the text inputs.
[14:42:20] <robertmaxrees> disabled is disabled.
[14:42:29] <robertmaxrees> if you don't want that functionality, don't use disabled ;)
[14:42:39] <Respek> interesting
[14:46:03] <LckyBy517> not sure if you guys can help me or not or if i should go talk to the author of this plugin.  I"m using waypoints.js on my website for a sticky nav bar
[14:46:45] <LckyBy517> when someone scrolls down to where the bottom of the entire header is i want the nav bar to pop back in at the top of the page
[14:46:55] <tocka> Respek, done it :) http://jsfiddle.net/z8qm0b04/1/
[14:47:12] <LckyBy517> only generally its way after that before it does :(
[14:47:26] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ LckyBy517
[14:47:26] <b-ot> LckyBy517: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:47:45] <LckyBy517> http://moosemanstudios.com/
[14:47:48] <LckyBy517> sorry was getting to the link haha
[14:48:04] <LckyBy517> i know you guys prefer a fiddle but i just can't get it to really reproduce
[14:48:23] <robertmaxrees> so you have a waypoint set to do that nav animation?
[14:48:44] <LckyBy517> well the animation is in css but basically i want the waypoint to bring the nav back in yes
[14:48:51] <LckyBy517> waypoints switches it to a fixed position at the top
[14:49:03] <LckyBy517> my problem seems to be in the offset which i define in sticky.js
[14:49:13] <robertmaxrees> sticky.js - pretty obvious what the problem is.
[14:49:18] <LckyBy517> i set it to the height of the header-wrapper
[14:49:19] <robertmaxrees> return -$('#header-wrapper').height()+$('#nav').height();
[14:49:54] <LckyBy517> yeah i wrote that
[14:50:07] <LckyBy517> its gotta be negative for the pixels from the top
[14:50:29] <robertmaxrees> ... right - but you want it after the user has just scolled past that nav, not the header?
[14:50:31] <LckyBy517> i orignally had it as just the height of the header wrapper but that wasn't doing it to so i added the height of the nav bar just to see and i still couldn't
[14:50:43] <LckyBy517> i want it after they have passed the header
[14:51:14] <robertmaxrees> there's a problem with the animation - the js side is working exactly as expected.
[14:51:50] <LckyBy517> i just removed the animation
[14:51:56] <LckyBy517> but it still shows up too late
[14:52:19] <LckyBy517> basically as that double line below the header is going off the screen i want it to appear
[14:52:38] <LckyBy517> its usually about the time it reaches the first element on the page below that before it pops in
[14:53:01] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else going on.
[14:53:14] <robertmaxrees> something is changing that height.
[14:53:30] <LckyBy517> the waypoints plugin is i've noticied that as well XD
[14:53:32] <robertmaxrees> try explicitly setting 295 or so and see if that works.
[14:54:03] <LckyBy517> i set it to 495 which is the height of the header-wrapper
[14:54:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:54:26] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.
[14:54:30] <robertmaxrees> it's 296
[14:55:31] <LckyBy517> LOL thats into the tablet style
[14:55:37] <LckyBy517> "tablet" rather
[14:55:58] <robertmaxrees> kay
[14:57:31] <LckyBy517> its adding 66 height to it when it gets stuck
[15:03:49] <LckyBy517> decided to log scrollTop and it got all the way to like 700 before it showed even with it set at 469 for the offset :(
[15:13:30] <jphase_> Clorith: you have a second?
[15:16:52] <Clorith> jphase_: ?
[15:17:34] <d4rklit3> hey
[15:17:43] <d4rklit3> if i alerady have a selection of a bunch of li's how do i search inside of that?
[15:17:53] <robertmaxrees> .filter()
[15:18:13] <jphase_> Clorith: I'm targeting you because it's sort of a cross-over between two channels. I'm specifically trying to filter and/or remove or retroactively clear the fields set by autocomplete on the registration form of wordpress. Now I can't find a filter to that helps me do this so I've officially delved into the realm of trying to do this with jQuery and I'm not having success with either atm lol
[15:18:30] <jphase_> because the values filled in are not really recognized by jQuery I guess?
[15:18:54] <Clorith> Just give the fields autocomplete="off" on the input ?
[15:19:17] <jphase_> yeah, the input isn't something I'm able to filter to my knowledge - default user_login input
[15:19:28] <Clorith> Yeah you can do anything youi want with those ;)
[15:19:34] <jphase_> orly?
[15:19:38] <jphase_> I am just missing something then
[15:19:50] <Clorith> Using javascript to clear out autocompletes is a bad idea in case the user runs a browser plugin or similar to do just that you shouldn't mess with their own setups
[15:20:05] <jphase_> yeah, it feels like I need to take a shower going down this path...
[15:20:31] <jphase_> I must've just missed out on the filter or hook I'm looking for - knowing it's possible gives me the info I need though - I'll find it
[15:20:33] <jphase_> thx :)
[15:38:54] <Lorcatar> I am using $.ajax and I am trying to use that with struts 2 to bring the data from javascript to java
[15:39:47] <Lorcatar> Is there a good resource on this?
[15:41:05] <robertmaxrees> ajax requests are just http requests.
[15:42:44] <Kazooie> Hi. I have an issue with this loop. I've tried several different ways but this is the last i could think of. is there any way I can do this to show all projects and not just the last one (which was my previous result, this one returns nothing) http://dpaste.com/2XBD1QF
[15:43:47] <robertmaxrees> you're not returning anything.
[15:44:18] <robertmaxrees> do you stuff outside of .html(), or return what you want in each one.
[15:44:51] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain it pretty well: http://api.jquery.com/html/
[15:59:27] <openyk> Looks like I am experiencing a fundamental problem
[15:59:39] <openyk> $('.column-right a') does not work
[15:59:59] <openyk> To be more clear, $('.column-right a').on('click', function(event) { 		$(event.target).toggleClass('selected'); 	}); does not work.
[16:01:08] <openyk> without the a, it works
[16:01:33] <robertmaxrees> what element are you trying to target?
[16:01:43] <robertmaxrees> does the a get added after you run the .on()?
[16:02:10] <openyk> it's just a normal <a> element
[16:04:06] <openyk> ah robert that was it, have to run the on after the a element gets created
[16:04:28] <openyk> you win reddit silver :)

[16:06:03] <Fang> Hey guys
[16:06:07] <Fang> I have a quick question
[16:06:14] <Fang> how do I select custom attributes in jQuery?
[16:06:27] <Fang> I did a lot of Googleing and couldn't find the answer.
[16:06:31] <Fang> Could someone help?
[16:08:23] <openyk> @fang I think it's
[16:08:49] <openyk> $('#id').attr('asd')
[16:08:59] <Fang> what if I don't have an id?
[16:09:14] <robertmaxrees> custom attributes are invalid.
[16:09:14] <LckyBy517> give it an id?
[16:09:14] <openyk> then you can use class $('.class')
[16:09:24] <robertmaxrees> also, check out .prop()
[16:09:27] <Fang> as in something like: <a folder="home">test</a>
[16:09:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can't do that.
[16:09:41] <robertmaxrees> browsers treat those in varying ways.
[16:09:47] <robertmaxrees> use data-* attribues instead.
[16:09:49] <Fang> Hmm, that's weird.
[16:09:59] <robertmaxrees> data-folder="home", then access with .data('folder')
[16:10:27] <Fang> is there any way I would add functionality to jQuery to remove the data- dependency?
[16:10:38] <robertmaxrees> it's a browser thing, not a jquery thing.
[16:10:54] <robertmaxrees> the spec for custom attributes is the data attributes system.
[16:11:35] <openyk> yeah fang don't sweat it I don't see how removing the data would serve you fundamentally
[16:12:02] <Fang> it's just shorter :(
[16:12:06] <robertmaxrees> the html5 data attributes spec exists explcitly so you can have what you're looking for.
[16:12:13] <robertmaxrees> lol brevity shouldn't be a big deal.
[16:12:23] <robertmaxrees> .data('folder') vs .prop('folder') isn't any short.
[16:12:35] <openyk> I know but shorter is not fundamental, they use data- for a reason, so that future keywords are not gonna leach into legacy code
[16:12:47] <robertmaxrees> *shorter.  and data is faster.
[16:13:06] <LucaS05> hey guys, i've this script: http://pastebin.com/4QXyTNrE but i don't get anything in $_POST['data'], any advice?
[16:13:15] <robertmaxrees> LucaS05 as in a room about php.
[16:13:18] <openyk> there is a good reason, don't sweat it and if you want something more intuitive, use name="namehere" and value="valuehere"
[16:13:31] <robertmaxrees> value is valid on anchors iirc.
[16:13:58] <LucaS05> ehm, they just send me here
[16:14:20] <robertmaxrees> LucaS05 ask them how you can look at all post data in a request.
[16:14:40] <openyk> lucas- try adding '' to the data field
[16:14:51] <openyk> { 'data' : 'heehee' }
[16:15:16] <openyk> welll to be more specific, { 'data' : spdArr}
[16:15:31] <LucaS05> robertmaxrees: as someone has pointed out right there "if you have nothing there (in the $_POST) then problem is not in php but in your implemention of javascript", so i'm here
[16:15:46] <robertmaxrees> LucaS05 did you try to see the whole post object entirely?
[16:15:49] <robertmaxrees> or just that one property?
[16:15:56] <LucaS05> openyk: i will try
[16:16:08] <openyk> yeah var_dump that whole post array
[16:16:32] <openyk> troubleshooting with echo/dump es gooderino tinkerino
[16:18:07] <robertmaxrees> also, check your network panel and make sure the URL is right.
[16:19:27] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of an easy way to take each index of a sub-array and create new arrays - for example - [ [0,1,2,3], [4,5,6,7], [8,9,10,11] ] - and make this [ [0,4,8], [1,5,9], [2,6,10], [3,7,11] ]
[16:20:36] <Forbidd3n> or take an array [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] and split it like my example
[16:21:19] <robertmaxrees> for loops in for loops?
[16:21:34] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I know, just not sure how to construct the loops to do it
[16:22:17] <Forbidd3n> I take the single array and create the sections, now trying to break sections into key matched arrays
[16:22:35] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual data you're dealing with?
[16:22:56] <Forbidd3n> [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
[16:23:09] <robertmaxrees> this... seems realy strange to me.  but ok.
[16:23:09] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:23:12] <Forbidd3n> and I need it to be split based on variable number
[16:23:21] <Forbidd3n> in this case 4
[16:23:30] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: ^
[16:23:53] <robertmaxrees> having a hard time understanding why you need that, but gimme a sec.
[16:25:09] <LckyBy517> homework assignment maybe?
[16:26:46] <Forbidd3n> LckyBy517: no, it is for the thing I was working on earlier
[16:26:53] <Forbidd3n> for the folding blocks
[16:26:59] <Forbidd3n> not sure if you were here
[16:29:40] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried so far?
[16:30:53] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/ws6h5ve8/ , and with that good night
[16:31:41] <Forbidd3n> decx: not exactly
[16:31:42] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:31:58] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I have a for inside a for to create the sub array groups
[16:32:03] <Forbidd3n> 4 groups of 6
[16:32:21] <Forbidd3n> now to take each indexed item of each sub array into its own array
[16:38:15] <Baz__> hello, is it possible to select from html that hasn't been added to the dom yet? var div = $('<div><a class="TEST"></a></div>'); $(div .TEST);;
[16:38:30] <robertmaxrees> div.find('.test')
[16:38:49] <Baz__> find eh............
[16:38:55] <Baz__> thanks, checkinf it out!
[16:39:05] <robertmaxrees> or $('.test', div), which does the exact same thing under the hood.
[16:39:44] <Baz__> i like that better actually
[16:40:06] <Baz__> it worked!
[16:40:09] <Baz__> thank u sir
[16:40:14] <robertmaxrees> that maps to the .find() method under the hood
[16:40:22] <robertmaxrees> but whatever floats your boat.
[17:25:09] <greengriminal> Quick question I can do: $('#search_toggle i') which will return the i class. now i am trying to do something like $('#search_toggle i') == 'fa fa-angle-double-down' but this keeps returning false
[17:25:16] <greengriminal> when i can see that the class is equal to that.
[17:25:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:25:37] <robertmaxrees> you want to see if it has those classes, you mean?
[17:28:09] <greengriminal> robertmaxrees: As an example: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9df137a5961c7bd97479
[17:28:12] <greengriminal> this is what i tried.
[17:28:35] <robertmaxrees> so you want to text the class of the element?
[17:28:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to use .hasClass()
[17:28:46] <robertmaxrees> and test each one individually.
[17:29:00] <robertmaxrees> the comparisons you're doing don't make any sense.
[17:29:10] <greengriminal> that's cool
[17:29:11] <greengriminal> thanks.
[17:32:04] <greengriminal> robertmaxrees: So on my page i have multiple i tags. Which ofc when i do $(i) returns back an array. I guess what i will need to do is loop through the array and check if each one contains that class
[17:32:31] <robertmaxrees> do you need ones with a particular class on them?
[17:32:36] <greengriminal> yes
[17:32:44] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() for that.
[17:32:58] <greengriminal> good point
[17:33:05] <greengriminal> _underscore filter() is really cool
[17:33:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery filter() is exactly what you want.
[17:33:35] <greengriminal> ;)
[17:33:43] <greengriminal> think i should spend a little time reading the dosc
[17:33:46] <greengriminal>  *docs
[17:33:59] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a great resource.
[17:34:03] <robertmaxrees> and http://api.jquery.com/ is fantastic, too.
[17:34:03] <greengriminal> though i rarely use jquery. Been a long time since i've used it.
[17:34:07] <greengriminal> Been using angularjs
[18:16:56] <jeffreylevesque> anyone here have experience with jquery ajax?
[18:24:41] <Forbidd3n> What is your question(s)?
[18:28:16] <Robdgreat> Forbidd3n: I take it he's just taking a survey
[18:28:19] <jeffreylevesque> Forbidd3n: I am trying to send a 'file upload' via ajax to php.  I was wondering if it was sufficient to set the 'contentType', and 'processData' both to false
[18:28:22] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/40f529bdd4cc16f2499f8dc1e929048623dd8760/src/js/ajax_data.js
[18:43:15] <dsize81> Has anyone used Froala editor? I initially was going to use a simple textarea which had a character counter at the bottom showing how many characters are left. SInce going to Froala, I can't seem to make it work. Could someone check out my fiddle and maybe point me int he right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/3akm68p3/
[18:57:12] <Lorcatar> What is the best way to get a json object into a java web-app. I can use Struts 2 if needed. Any experience would be greatly appreciated.
[19:01:37] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of an easy way to take each index of a sub-array and create new arrays - for example - [ [0,1,2,3], [4,5,6,7], [8,9,10,11] ] - and make this [ [0,4,8], [1,5,9], [2,6,10], [3,7,11] ]
[19:01:47] <Forbidd3n> or take an array [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] and split it like my example
[19:01:56] <EoN> Can I get a jQuery object reference to a dom when i only have the element? (the element doesnt have an id)
[19:02:41] <EoN> so I've clicked on an <a> and as a result of an onclick, the 'event' object returned shows me the currentTarget is an '<a>'. i want to use jquery to do some stuff with that a. but how do i get a reference to it?
[19:03:22] <Forbidd3n> $('a').on('click', function(element){ ... });
[19:03:25] <Forbidd3n> element is the item
[19:03:32] <Forbidd3n> or you can use $(this) I believe
[19:09:15] <wa5ted> is there any way to restrict x-overflow
[19:09:19] <wa5ted> on touch devices
[19:09:39] <wa5ted> i have an image that goes beyond borders of screen and even though i have set the body x-overflow to hidden
[19:09:54] <wa5ted> touch devices still breach this rule
[19:38:08] <shoky> Forbidd3n that's called zipping. many libraries have a zip function e.g. _.zip in underscore/lodash or copy from somewhere like  http://stackoverflow.com/a/10284006/1098884
[19:39:03] <Forbidd3n> shoky: awesome! Thanks!
[19:43:37] <kinesis> Hey can someone check this jsfidle -> http://jsfiddle.net/z2qaa6zk/4/  for some reason alert(MyText) isnt popping up
[19:46:31] <tandroid> kinesis: what is "#enter_number"
[19:46:33] <tandroid> Oh
[19:46:40] <tandroid> nvm
[19:46:58] <kinesis> Woops
[19:47:08] <kinesis> It use to be .submit but that was triggering .ready
[19:47:12] <kinesis> It was unintended operation
[19:47:48] <kinesis> reload it
[19:48:46] <tandroid> kinesis: well I would start by loading jquery into your fiddle
[19:49:15] <kinesis> done
[19:50:55] <tandroid> So, its definitely not working because you have php in there
[19:51:07] <Forbidd3n> shoky: have you seen any jquery that can do this affect? - https://www.dropbox.com/s/hb6vtjgscdy7v0i/AnimationTest.mov?dl=0
[19:51:10] <tandroid> If you need that as a string, you can put quotes around it and you should be good?
[19:51:27] <tandroid> but… why in the world would you need to send that?
[19:51:35] <tandroid> What are you trying to do kinesis?
[19:51:42] <kinesis> Yeah it wokrs
[19:51:44] <kinesis> Works*
[19:51:48] <shoky> Forbidd3n: didn't decx show something that sorta did it?
[19:51:55] <kinesis> Yeah forgot about that string in there. Day's been stressful, eye to detail not quite there
[19:52:04] <Ayub15> there is a conflict with bootstrap and jquery ui, as described here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23428285/bootstrap-and-jqueryui-conflict
[19:52:07] <Forbidd3n> shoky: it didn't do what needed to be done
[19:52:28] <Ayub15> where should I use the code mentioned in that article ?
[19:54:53] <shoky> Forbidd3n: what specifically
[19:55:44] <Forbidd3n> move cursor so that rdio starts to turn white - transition an image to square blind out to a div under which has text
[19:55:59] <Forbidd3n> .01 - .02 in the video
[19:56:57] <Ayub15> is there an irc for bootstrap ?
[19:57:34] <tandroid> I think just #bootstrap
[19:58:01] <tandroid> oh ##bootstrap
[19:58:08] <Ayub15> ok
[19:58:17] <kinesis> It's a phone verification system from Twilio API.
[19:58:25] <kinesis> It works in my jsfiddle, but not in production
[19:59:30] <Forbidd3n> shoky: see what I am trying to accomplish?
[20:00:59] <kinesis> Why would it work perfectly fine in jsFiddle but not work on my main site?
[20:09:05] <kinesis> How can i check for conflicts? it's such a simple script ( http://jsfiddle.net/z2qaa6zk/13/ ) I'm wondering why it is not popping the alert() box
[20:09:17] <kinesis> It works fine in jsFiddle but not on my website
[20:09:37] <HikaruBG> hi guys!
[20:09:45] <mdev> hi hikarubg
[20:09:53] <mdev> is setting onclick bad?
[20:10:00] <mdev> should i just listen for an event for an id?
[20:10:06] <Ayub15> I see this error Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: supplier-button
[20:10:26] <Ayub15> I get the above error when I change the item in drop down menu created using jquery ui
[20:10:27] <HikaruBG> how to select all LI elements in a UL list and to have them toggle("slow") one after another when the document is ready?
[20:10:32] <tw2113> i avoid adding click handlers as attributes whenever i can
[20:10:48] <mdev> any particular reason
[20:10:57] <Ayub15> there  is a conflict between jquery ui and bootstrap
[20:11:34] <tw2113> mucks up the markup, harder to manage as well
[20:12:26] <mdev> alright i'll set a listen even for clicks on the class
[20:12:41] <mdev> then extra data i set prior from data attribute name, seems cleaner anyway
[20:12:44] <mdev> thanks
[20:16:13] <Ayub15> can I bypass bootstrap temporarily ?
[20:17:08] <shoky> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/d2yoyxs4/1/
[20:17:51] <Forbidd3n> shoky: that is correct. any way to break the vertical rectangles into small squares?
[20:18:01] <shoky> Forbidd3n: yes :)
[20:18:08] <shoky> enjoy :P
[20:19:15] <Forbidd3n> shoky: does that mean you're not going to help me make the squares? I have been on this all day and have attempted many options. :)
[20:19:26] <shoky> yes ;)
[20:20:26] <Forbidd3n> :(
[20:20:29] <Forbidd3n> ugh
[20:20:39] <Forbidd3n> can you give me a little hint, please? :)
[20:20:42] <kinesis> Fr some reason the alert box pops up in jsFiddle but not on my side. Same identical code.
[20:20:45] <kinesis> What would cause this?
[20:20:50] <kinesis> not on my site*
[20:20:56] <shoky> Forbidd3n: do the same thing the fiddle does.. but for the veritcal axis too.
[20:21:09] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/z2qaa6zk/24/
[20:21:23] <kinesis> 25 now
[20:21:59] <kinesis> I think it has something to do with the $.post
[20:22:45] <kinesis> That goes off for sure, but the alert box going off with the verification_code's input showing just doesn't kick off. It does in the jsFiddle.
[20:26:58] <HikaruBG> guys - how can I select all LI elements and push them into Array?
[20:28:50] <aceom> Can someone tell me why my map doesn't work please? smarturl.it/noxj3g
[20:31:24] <tw2113> have you checked your js console?
[20:31:45] <Forbidd3n> shoky: kind of there - http://jsfiddle.net/d2yoyxs4/3/ - what would I be doing wrong for it not going the entire height?
[20:31:47] <kinesis> Yeah
[20:32:22] <shoky> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/d2yoyxs4/2/
[20:32:50] <shoky> you were getting close..
[20:32:56] <Forbidd3n> http://jsfiddle.net/d2yoyxs4/4/
[20:33:01] <Forbidd3n> I have one row working there
[20:33:28] <shoky> yes, they all have top:0
[20:33:58] <kinesis> why would jsFiddle's alert() work but not my site's
[20:34:31] <shoky> check your console for errors, kinesis
[20:34:34] <Forbidd3n> this is working for top, but messes up left - 'top': (i/y)*height + 'px'
[20:34:49] <shoky> Forbidd3n because i  is for horizontal....
[20:35:03] <Forbidd3n> I tried nesting another loop
[20:35:04] <Forbidd3n> didn't work
[20:35:10] <shoky> i just gave you a fiddle doing it man
[20:36:14] <shoky> you'll never get anywhere if you don't actually think about what you're doing :\
[20:36:41] <Forbidd3n> I am trying to do it - the one you gave goes up to the right not to the right - thanks for your help :)
[20:36:57] <shoky> if they all went just to the right you woudln't see the vertical slicing..
[20:37:03] <shoky> try it ;)
[20:37:10] <kinesis> There are no errors
[20:37:13] <tw2113> try it before you buy it
[20:37:15] <kinesis> it's just one big mystery
[20:37:33] <shoky> even a bigger mystery for us cause we can't see what you're talking about
[20:38:38] <tw2113> shoky, his fiddle works fine, his live site doesn't
[20:38:43] <tw2113> same code apparently
[20:38:51] <kinesis> I took the document.ready off
[20:38:53] <shoky> i know
[20:38:55] <Forbidd3n> shoky: I believe you would see the slicing - you can see it with one row here - http://jsfiddle.net/d2yoyxs4/4/
[20:38:56] <kinesis> but I still don't get my alert box.
[20:39:08] * kinesis *hair falling out over simple thing taking 2 hours to fix*
[20:39:35] <shoky> Forbidd3n no you would not see it because all rows would go to the right at the same time, it would look as if there is no vertical slicing at all , like here:  http://jsfiddle.net/d2yoyxs4/5/
[20:39:53] <shoky> Forbidd3n:  there is actually the same veritcal slicing there, i just commented the  'top: 20%'  in the animation css
[20:39:59] <shoky> so it goes exactly to the right
[20:40:14] <tw2113> where's the callback for the success handler on $.post?
[20:40:25] <Forbidd3n> ok, so what if I added an increment of .1 or somethign to each slide transition
[20:40:36] <shoky> that'd work too, sure
[20:40:40] <shoky> go for it ;)
[20:41:00] <Ayub15> how can I use both jquery ui and bootstrap ?
[20:41:41] <doug_> tw2113: it returns a promise: do this: $.post('my/url', { some: data }).done(function(data) { console.log('yay'); }).fail(function(err) { console.error('crap'); })
[20:41:49] <tw2113> no idea how kinesis' fiddle is supposed to be tested, we don't have any access to the php
[20:41:53] <Ayub15> I am getting a Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: supplier-button  when I change the item in select menu
[20:42:04] <kinesis> So I have this jsfiddle at http://jsfiddle.net/z2qaa6zk/27/  the alert box works, but on the main site itself same html same javascript does not pop an alert box. What would cause this? There is nothing in the console, and jquery version is jquery-2.1.1.min.js  there is also modernizr-2.6.2-respond-1.1.0.min.js  loaded.
[20:42:31] <kinesis> tw2113: i changed it, it's just a phone number pulled from database
[20:42:40] <kinesis> You just enter 1234 in the box and click Verify
[20:43:15] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know machine learnng?
[20:43:21] <tw2113> is the php half supposed to fill in the info box?
[20:43:36] <tw2113> otherwise all you're doing is grabbing a text value to pass into a function that immediately alerts
[20:43:36] <doug_> jeffreylevesque: never met him
[20:43:36] <kinesis> the php half is gone on  http://jsfiddle.net/z2qaa6zk/27/
[20:43:46] <kinesis> that PHP is from server side
[20:43:57] <kinesis> when interpreted by the browser it is an actual phone number
[20:44:17] <tw2113> what i'm getting at is that I see no interaction betweent your two functions at the bottom
[20:44:19] <jeffreylevesque> doug, https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/
[20:44:33] <jeffreylevesque> doug_:
[20:44:40] <kinesis> Document loads, an SMS message is sent
[20:44:53] <tw2113> on ready, you call the initiateSms function that posts whatever to a php file
[20:44:54] <kinesis> user sees SMS message, enters it in box, clicks Verify. FOr now I just want an Alert box to pop up
[20:44:59] <tw2113> then on click, you do something completely unrelated
[20:45:08] <tw2113> ah, there's user interaction
[20:45:41] <tw2113> and which part is failing on your live site?
[20:45:53] <kinesis> That script and html are copied verbatim
[20:46:04] <tw2113> the on click alert isn't working there?
[20:46:15] <kinesis> jsFiddle pops alert(),  the site does not. jquery-2.1.1.min.js  there is also modernizr-2.6.2-respond-1.1.0.min.js  loaded
[20:46:20] <kinesis> Yeah
[20:46:45] <kinesis> I was thinking maybe those two scripts are conflicting or causing it to be confused. I'm unsure
[20:46:56] <kinesis> I'll try tha, actuall
[20:47:01] <tw2113> i'd be surprised to be honest
[20:47:05] <tw2113> if that did solve it
[20:47:58] <tw2113> the only way i could see that click not working is if your selector doesn't actually match, or there's some error going on that prevents the loading of the rest
[20:48:04] <kinesis> Yeah it didnt
[20:48:27] <kinesis> selector?
[20:48:36] <tw2113> $('#verify_code')
[20:48:39] <kinesis> I'm unsure. the console reports nothing
[20:48:54] <kinesis> except 500 Internal Srver Error with that $.post. I've tried disabling the .post
[20:48:54] <Forbidd3n> shoky: anyway to use this transition instead of ease-out -- transform: rotateY(90deg);
[20:48:55] <tw2113> throw in a console.log inside your click handler
[20:49:03] <kinesis> ok how?
[20:49:19] <tw2113> literally type: console.log('something witty to help debug');
[20:49:38] <tw2113> your 500 internal server error is a different issue to deal with later
[20:50:11] <tw2113> once you have that console.log() bit in there, refresh the page, and then click the button
[20:50:14] <shoky> Forbidd3n: whatever
[20:50:31] <kinesis> I put it in the .click area
[20:50:34] <kinesis> Nothing
[20:50:42] <kinesis> jQuery is ignoring the .click
[20:50:54] <tw2113> or it's not matching
[20:51:18] <kinesis> <input type="button" id="verify_code" value="Verify" />
[20:51:26] <kinesis> $("#verify_code").click(function() {
[20:51:32] <tw2113> console.log( $('#verify_code').length );
[20:51:36] <kinesis> ok
[20:51:48] <kinesis> put that in the .ready?
[20:51:54] <tw2113> sure
[20:52:02] <tw2113> or the click handler
[20:52:23] <shoky> um. your click handler isn't in a document.ready handler
[20:52:43] <tw2113> good catch that i missed
[20:52:46] <shoky> yet your ajax request which doesn't need the document to be ready, is ;P
[20:53:05] <kinesis> yeah it works in the .ready
[20:53:14] <tw2113> i'm blaming my spaghetti for distracting me
[20:53:33] <shoky> don't make me hungry
[20:53:41] <tw2113> basically it's trying to select the dom element before it's even rendered
[20:53:41] <shoky> ok i'm hungry
[20:53:47] <tw2113> you're welcome shoky <3
[20:53:55] <shoky> :F
[20:54:16] <tw2113> nice big plate full
[20:54:31] <kinesis> now it works.
[20:54:48] <tw2113> unless your js is at the end of the page, drop it in a .ready() check
[20:55:27] <tw2113> though ajax doesn't need it, as shoky pointed out
[21:05:49] <Forbidd3n> shoky: ok, I believe I have it working - anyway to slow down the transition?
[21:07:04] <shoky> Forbidd3n: seriously? goodnight
[21:07:11] <Forbidd3n> ok goodnight
[21:07:12] <Forbidd3n> thanks
[21:07:19] <Forbidd3n> I was just asking
[21:07:45] <Ayub15> why do I get the Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: supplier-button
[21:12:48] <kinesis> so would the variable 'data' be interpreted as data in this $.post json ? http://pastie.org/private/pjakyytafveuv1jmdfl2wq
[21:13:03] <tw2113> because that pseudo element isn't supported Ayub15
[21:13:11] <tw2113> what file is it coming from?
[21:13:19] <doug_> Ayub15: a typo in a selector or using troublesome characters
[21:13:29] <Ayub15> tw2113: its coming from jquery
[21:13:43] <tw2113> so it's coming from jquery.js?
[21:13:56] <tw2113> or some similar named file
[21:14:03] <Ayub15> yes, I am using jquery and bootstrap with JSF2
[21:14:52] <Ayub15> JSF2 is automatically appending ids to elements eg: id="j_123:supplier"
[21:15:39] <Ayub15> I am creating select menu using $( ".supplier" ).selectmenu()
[21:15:40] <doug_> Ayub15: like this http://jsfiddle.net/xge8r6sm/
[21:15:43] <doug_> ?
[21:15:57] <Ayub15> whenever I change select menu I get the pseudo error
[21:16:02] <kinesis> tw2113, would the variable 'data' be literally interpreted (within the json) in my pastie?
[21:16:22] <mdev> I have version 1.8.3
[21:16:34] <tw2113> you're not passing it as a string or whatever with that json going to sms.php
[21:16:36] <mdev> why does live work for dynamic stuff created
[21:16:40] <mdev> but .on doesn;t?
[21:16:42] <tw2113> it's probably being interpreted as a variable as is
[21:16:47] <kinesis> http://pastie.org/private/pjakyytafveuv1jmdfl2wq
[21:16:50] <doug_> mdev: old jquery version
[21:16:54] <kinesis> { verification_code : data }
[21:17:08] <doug_> mdev: or doing it wrong
[21:17:24] <tw2113> http://jsonlint.com/
[21:17:28] <Ayub15> doug: I am selecting using $('.supplier');
[21:17:58] <tw2113> Expecting 'STRING'
[21:18:18] <Ayub15> error comes only when changing the select element
[21:19:24] <Ayub15> doug: page works when not using bootstap
[21:21:35] <pinche> Would somebody be willing to code review my open-sourced jQuery plugin?
[21:23:27] <Ayub15> one way I found is to remove the colon from id of element..how can I dynamically do this using jquery ?
[21:24:28] <Uhkis> pinche: link?
[21:24:54] <pinche> Uhkis: https://github.com/fcosrno/taxonomy-jquery
[21:27:04] <pinche> Uhkis: I basically would like to know if the code looks decent and if I am missing any major concepts. I come from a heavy back-end PHP background, so I may be conflating some concepts for front-end. Any advice or tips would be appreciated.
[21:33:04] <mdev> doug don't know how I can "do it wrong"
[21:33:15] <mdev> $(".terminate").live( "click", function() {
[21:33:19] <mdev> pretty straight forward
[21:33:29] <mdev> version is 1.8.3
[21:33:45] <mdev> that's what  alert(jQuery.fn.jquery); says
[21:35:56] <Ohga> Requesting a bit of someones time to figure out how to setup Autocomplete from jq-ui to ignore a prefix when searching and retaining the prefix when updating with the found entry
[21:59:59] <EoN> is there any channel focused on localstorage that ppl know of? (indexeddb)?
[22:05:04] <doug_> EoN: probably #html5
[22:06:48] <doug_> EoN: perhaps also ##javascript
[22:24:44] <Forbidd3n> brain fart - what is it called to $.func(){...} $('.item').func(); ?
[22:25:46] <Forbidd3n> nvm
[22:29:34] <tw2113> release that gas!
[22:36:52] <kinesis> Can nyone tell me why the second $.post in this script : http://pastie.org/private/gpzgz3sv8ickct8iar1c0g  is not executing on my server?
[22:58:06] <kinesis> how do i trace the cause of 500 Internal Server Error caused from a jQuery $.post?
[22:58:25] <kinesis> I see nothing in my error log, and using PHP's error_log("test 123") function as the first line in said script shows nothing either.
[22:59:53] <snover> that’s a php question
[23:13:26] <kinesis> http://pastie.org/private/vxtgjsvpcsslgjmjmlrjaq  why does my second $.post not work right? 500 Internal Error and the script doesn't even execute at all, I know this becuase line one of that PHP script has error_log("This is a test."); and I normally see that in /var/log/apache2/error.log but it is not there.
[23:28:01] <Cork> kinesis: 5xx is error callbacks not success
[23:28:32] <Cork> kinesis: so you need to use either deferred .fail or use $.ajax that has the optional error option
[23:28:34] <kinesis> yes the script wont execute
[23:28:45] <kinesis> ok
[23:46:26] <anli_> Is $('body').on('click', 'img.zoomable', etc making a list of img.zoomable before the body has been clicked?
[23:46:46] <Cork> anli_: what do you mean?
[23:47:05] <anli_> That if I add some img.zoomable to the dom afterwards, the click handler will not trigger?
[23:47:21] <Cork> that syntax is delegated event handlers
[23:47:29] <Cork> it is explicitly made for that case
[23:47:52] <Cork> it relies on the fact that events bubbles to the parent
[23:48:00] <anli_> Yes
[23:48:14] <anli_> What I wonder is if it will trigger for new images
[23:48:25] <Cork> "it is explicitly made for that case" <--
[23:49:00] <anli_> Sorry, I fail to interpret your answer
[23:49:26] <Cork> delegated event handlers was explicitly made for the use case of elements added after the handler was attached
[23:49:42] <anli_> Aha, that piece of information had some value
[23:49:58] <anli_> Hm, then I have to investigate why it is not triggering
[23:50:35] <anli_> (I have added some crap to lightbox.js)
[23:50:54] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/6gLtcdcx/1/ <--- hi. why am I able to get 2 but not 50?
[23:51:00] <Kartagis> both are #li
[23:51:37] <anli_> #li refers to elements with the id "li"
[23:51:44] <anli_> "li" refers to tagname
[23:51:49] <Cork> Kartagis: don't add random attributes on dom elements
[23:52:00] <Cork> use data- for custom attributes
[23:52:29] <Kartagis> anli_: I know
[23:52:32] <Cork> Kartagis: also your html is invalid
[23:52:39] <Cork> you have two elements with the same id
[23:52:48] <Kartagis> argh
[23:52:50] <Cork> and id is by spec unique
[23:53:10] <Cork> so id will only return the first element with it
[23:53:13] <Cork> Kartagis: use a class
