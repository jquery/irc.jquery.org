[00:01:08] <tds5016> anyone able to help me out with it?
[00:02:54] <binaryfus10nz> maybe... can you help me?
[00:03:06] <binaryfus10nz> very simple snippet of code.. plz see line 3-4 http://collabedit.com/atrpu
[00:19:37] <tdignan> unstable: haha, looks like it works now, huh!
[00:19:53] <tdignan> I wonder what your real issue is.. good luck integrating your fix
[00:20:33] <tdignan> unstable: line 37 looks like a syntax error
[00:28:32] <Ortund> already know I'm working too much in script... I just typed /join $jquery by mistake
[00:29:51] <Ortund> is it possible to use jquery to remove html in a an element? like if I wanted to remove all <br /> tags inside my div for example...
[00:30:08] <tdignan> $(foo).html("")
[00:30:36] <Ortund> wouldn't that remove all child elements from foo?
[00:30:54] <tdignan> Oh, you only want to remove <br />?
[00:31:26] <tdignan> I guess you could do a search/replace. but you'd be committing the cardinal sin of parsing html with regex. Better to iterate children, check if <br/> then remove
[00:31:39] <Eviltwin> $(foo).find("br").remove() ?
[00:32:06] <Ortund> Eviltwin, that looks like a brilliant idea
[00:32:40] <Ortund> for clarity, what I want to do is rewrite the html structure of this to modify the layout http://pastebin.com/P9rkrXHd
[00:32:56] <Ortund> I've been looking at replaceWith()
[00:35:19] <tdignan> Eviltwin's command will work perfectly because it will find all the <br> elements on the DOM and since <br/> never has any children you're all set.
[00:35:59] <bluepnume> Can anyone tell me how to trigger a click event on an element in a popup window? This works: mypopup.document.getElementById('foo').click() -- this doesn't: $('#foo', mypopup.document).click()
[00:36:30] <Ortund> bluepnume why not just use the one that works?
[00:36:33] <tdignan> why not just $('#foo').click()?
[00:36:55] <Ortund> or that
[00:37:32] <bluepnume> Ortund: Because I want to be able to use jQuery to trigger other events too, not just click
[00:37:48] <bluepnume> Ortund/tdignan: that references the parent window...
[00:38:14] <tdignan> bluepnume: ids are supposed to be unique
[00:38:39] <air_> howdy.
[00:38:43] <tdignan> maybe you want $("#foo").find("the element").click() ?
[00:39:13] <bluepnume> tdignan: What, unique across different windows...:
[00:39:30] <air_> I'm looking for a solution to make an input field that behaves similar to how you configure time in os x, that is, free text + a few "variables" that can be dragged into the input field.
[00:39:56] <air_> I've found lots of "tag" solutions that might be a starting point.
[00:40:13] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure what you're referring to exactly
[00:40:19] <bluepnume> tdignan: I need to select the element in the popup window. $('#foo', mypopup.document) works -- it finds the right element. it just won't click
[00:40:52] <Eviltwin> bluepnume: How is the click listener attached?
[00:40:57] <Eviltwin> Or are you not trying to trigger a listener?
[00:41:15] <bluepnume> Eviltwin: trying to trigger a click on an <a> element
[00:41:28] <Eviltwin> With the intent of....?
[00:42:32] <bluepnume> Eviltwin: replicating what would happen if a user clicked on that element. Loading the href, or triggering any event callbacks attached to the element
[00:43:04] <air_> i.e. this functionality is what I want to achieve -> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/518422/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-12%20at%2009.41.05.png
[00:43:30] <Eviltwin> What the hell is that?
[00:43:40] <air_> (it's date and time configuration in os x)
[00:45:13] <tdignan> bluepnume: I wonder if it's a security feature that is getting in your way
[00:45:37] <tdignan> allowing a script to do that does sound incredibly seedy
[00:45:38] <Eviltwin> bluepnume: If you want to trigger listeners bound by jQuery, you can use jQuery's .click() method
[00:45:56] <Eviltwin> If you want to follow that link, do window.location = myLink.href
[00:46:55] <Eviltwin> air_: jQuery UI sortable might also make for a good start
[00:47:28] <bluepnume> tdignan: yeah this was my thought, but I figured it's all fair game providing there's no cross-domain stuff going on
[00:47:39] <meoooww> hello , first time login
[00:47:58] <bluepnume> Eviltwin: yep, I'm using click() -- the problem is I'm trying to click an element in a popup window, and it's not working
[00:48:19] <Eviltwin> Then it's frame.location = myLink.href
[00:49:10] <meoooww> is this channel active ?
[00:49:57] <Eviltwin> No
[00:50:05] <meoooww> frame.contentWindow.document. ...
[00:50:10] <bluepnume> tdignan: also, thinking about it, if it were a security feature I wouldn't be able to use document.getelementbyid('foo').click ... that works
[00:50:24] <air_> Eviltwin: thanks, maybe that would do, but IIRC it's more about sorting nodes on the same level, and I want to combine textnodes with elements.
[00:50:53] <Eviltwin> bluepnume: There are some compatability isseus with that method: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.click
[00:50:58] <air_> Maybe the tag-it jquery widget might be an easier starting point.
[00:51:35] <meoooww> new Array; ...add(node) .. add(node) .. add(text) .. join('') ...... $().html( ..)
[00:51:48] <air_> combined with draggable and droppable..
[00:52:12] <Eviltwin> meoooww: That's a beautiful...pile of code
[00:53:27] <meoooww> thx
[00:54:27] <meoooww> but I haven't tried this yet
[00:54:40] <Eviltwin> Well I may have been a little bit sarcastic
[00:56:42] <meoooww> the method .. join('') produces things like this
[00:56:44] <meoooww> "[object HTMLHeadingElement][object HTMLHeadingElement]hello betty"
[00:56:54] <Eviltwin> It sure does
[00:57:25] <Cork> meoooww: why are you using join?
[00:57:34] <meoooww> ahh , append(node), append(node), append('text'), may work
[00:57:57] <meoooww> Array .join(), just combine the fragments of html
[00:58:04] <Eviltwin> I will give you this one free piece of advice
[00:58:09] <Eviltwin> .join is going to be the wrong way to go
[00:58:12] <Cork> meoooww:  $().html(.add().add().add().add(text));
[00:58:48] <Cork> just add the result form jquery directly
[00:59:33] <meoooww> btw how do I specify the guy named "meow" ?
[00:59:50] <Cork> what?
[01:00:05] <Eviltwin> I believe you just have
[01:10:36] <xec> <Eviltwin> .join is going to be the wrong way to go
[01:10:41] <xec> challenge accepted!
[01:11:32] <xec> $(node).add(node).add(node).map(function(){return $(this).text()}).get().join('')
[01:12:15] <Eviltwin> Nope
[01:12:18] <Eviltwin> You want .html() not .text()
[01:12:27] <xec> dammit!
[01:12:30] * xec starts crying
[01:12:32] <Eviltwin> And actually you want the outerHTML, not the innerHTML
[01:12:43] <Eviltwin> So you're not even going to be able to stay in jQuery land
[01:12:57] <xec> challenge accepted!
[01:14:07] <xec> $(node).add(node).add(node).map(function(){ return $("<div>").html(this).html()}).get().join('')
[01:14:24] <xec> shouldn't that work? or maybe i should read more closely what's actually wanted? xD
[01:14:50] <Eviltwin> That would probably work but, again, is needlessly expensive
[01:16:34] <xec> meoooww: what is it that you actually wanted?
[01:16:55] <tds5016> how would I select an li with a given id in a specific list?
[01:17:13] <xec> tds5016: $("#id")
[01:17:21] <xec> (id's should be unique..)
[01:17:23] <tds5016> .exportList li#3 doesn't seem to find id 3
[01:17:29] <xec> ah
[01:17:31] <tds5016> xec in this case it isnt :-/.
[01:17:34] <aMoniker> 3 isn't a valid id
[01:17:37] <Eviltwin> tds5016: Then fix it
[01:17:39] <air_> id's shouldn't be allowed to start with numbers.
[01:17:40] <xec> yes, you can't start with a number and use #3
[01:18:34] <xec> actually, id="3" is valid html, but it didn't use to be
[01:18:54] <air_> wut, that's crazy.
[01:19:01] <meoooww> ha, I'm crawling api.jquery.com , using wget
[01:19:11] <Eviltwin> Lovely...
[01:19:19] <xec> tds5016: you could try $('.exportList li[id="3"]')
[01:19:37] <meoooww> li:eq(3)
[01:19:45] <Eviltwin> No...
[01:19:49] <xec> meoooww: that would ignore the ID
[01:20:03] <Eviltwin> meoooww: It might help if you learned jQuery before giving advice on it
[01:20:09] <meoooww> what the one want is jsut the index number
[01:20:14] <xec> meoooww: and pick the 4th item
[01:20:28] <tds5016> I just made the id to li-3
[01:20:29] <tds5016> :-)
[01:20:39] <xec> tds5016: better :)
[01:20:42] <tds5016> was probably the right hting to do.
[01:20:44] <tds5016> lol. haha.
[01:20:45] <meoooww> ya, go and read the selectors part of api.jquery.com
[01:20:48] <tds5016> thanks for the help!
[01:20:56] <tds5016> and calling me out on being stupid. haha.
[01:23:19] <air_> xec: thanks for pointing out the id thingie, I didn't see that coming (that start by number is allowed)
[01:23:56] <meoooww> the cmd,   "wget -a\j.log -P\p -Emkp http://api.jquery.com/", may help store all the articles locally
[01:24:11] <xec> meoooww: are you serious?
[01:24:24] <dsevigny> grafi if you're still here, thanks a lot for the lead on masonry. That and Masonry Ordered solved my problem. Only appear to have one small issue hanging, but it's due to the size of various divs
[01:24:26] <meoooww> I will copy them to the machine , if the corpation, has limit of net
[01:26:06] <xec> air_: it makes things a lot harder when it comes to selecting though, so starting an id with anything but a letter is a bad idea
[01:26:21] <meoooww> corporation .. but read them in the office , seems stupid sometimes ye ?
[01:26:43] <Eviltwin> meoooww: Do you actually have a specific jQuery-related question?
[01:27:28] <air_> xec: yeah, I agree. I've been working xml/xslt for years, so this really sounds like a bad idea to me.
[01:27:56] <meoooww> yes, did you guys read the reference in the office ? I did, and I suspect that some one else thinks of that as stupid action
[01:28:39] <Eviltwin> I don't know what you mean by "tead the reference in the office"
[01:28:43] <Eviltwin> read*
[01:29:23] <meoooww> when at work , reading the reference , a bit too long
[01:30:04] <Eviltwin> Do you mean did I read the entirety of api.jquery.com?
[01:30:15] <meoooww> more or less
[01:30:26] <air_> why don't you read what you need, when you need it?
[01:30:27] <Eviltwin> I have over time
[01:30:39] <Eviltwin> Mostly what I did was search for names similar to the things I wanted to do
[01:30:47] <Eviltwin> Like if I wanted to append an element somewhere, I searched "append"
[01:30:54] <Eviltwin> If I wanted to find an element I searched "find"
[01:31:16] <Eviltwin> It also helps to dive into the categories on the side
[01:31:39] <Eviltwin> Like "Manipulation" or "Effects" or "Selectors" or "Traversing"
[01:31:56] <Eviltwin> Stay focused on what you're trying to accomplish
[01:31:59] <meoooww> but nowadays , articles over internet goes scattered, even affects my English
[01:32:40] <meoooww> yes, stay focused
[01:33:25] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to select specific elements, scan through the "Selectors" category
[01:33:38] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to change the DOM, scan through "Manipulation"
[01:34:02] <Eviltwin> This is the strategy I use and most people I know use
[01:34:34] * xec just bashes his forehead against the keyboard until things work
[01:34:38] <meoooww> thx for your advice
[01:37:11] <meoooww> I wrote things like this   http://silvestris.sinaapp.com/trial/static/keystroke.html   and lost ideas any further
[01:39:54] <meoooww> mixed fundamental seems more flexible
[01:40:03] <meoooww> fundamental js and jquery code
[01:41:13] <Eviltwin> If you're saying that jQuery and JavaScript should be used together, then yes.
[01:51:52] <jorn> heyho, i have a weird issue with jquery1.9.1: when running a website which does an ajax request to some endpoint it seems the ajax return type autoguessing does not work. when i host the same stuff on a server (ajax request goes to the same endpoint in both cases which is the server), the return type autoguessing suddenly seems to work
[01:52:17] <jorn> so locally i manually have to set the datatype:"json" parameter, while remotely it seems to be implied
[01:52:26] <jorn> any idea why that is or what i could google for?
[01:54:55] <reloadz> hi! i have three select tags. if the first changes, then seconds must load and after seconds loads it needs to change the thirst...
[01:55:48] <reloadz> i can change seconds by useing event "change" for the forst... but if i use "change" on second select it dosent do anything
[01:55:54] <reloadz> hope you get my problem
[01:56:28] <reloadz> thirs select depends on second and second depends on first
[01:56:31] <jorn> reloadz: is it possible your css selectors aren't correct?
[01:56:54] <jorn> assign unique id attributes to your selects and try based on them
[01:58:21] <reloadz> http://pastebin.com/JwspV4Cn
[01:59:06] <meoooww> $('#second').onload(func_change_first)
[01:59:46] <d3nial> hey, having a brain jam around a really easy bit of code, anyone mind me throwing a question out there??
[02:01:56] <aMoniker> sorry we're full on questions, but we'd be happy to accept queries
[02:05:18] * meoooww what does this say
[02:06:09] <d3nial> :P
[02:06:31] <d3nial> thanks, query is, i have an html tag, data-variable = some_string
[02:07:00] <d3nial> and JS script trying to retrieve a couple variables,
[02:07:15] <d3nial> onkeydown="if (event.keyCode == 13) function('+ var1 +','+var2+')"
[02:07:41] <d3nial> i keep getting syntax errors etc, I think it has something to do with strings, but json_encode etc hasnt been nice either
[02:08:53] <aMoniker> could you make a jsfiddle for it?
[02:09:05] <meoooww> eval("if ...")
[02:09:31] <meoooww> onkeydown=function(e){... ?
[02:12:39] <d3nial> hrm not sure, ill check that one out
[02:12:54] <d3nial> im pretty sure its just because the variable isnt being passed as a string properly
[02:13:22] <d3nial> if i could echo is with json_encode things would be sweet, but not so easy apparently
[02:13:30] <Ortund> I'm making progress :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15356112/how-to-modify-yahoo-weather-appearance-on-my-page
[02:13:57] <Ortund> So far I have the div around the image written in, but not sure how to manage it for the "Partly Cloudy" and "Forecast" chunks
[02:14:19] <CaptainQuirk> Hi there
[02:15:23] <CaptainQuirk> I'm trying to hide a whole column in a table. By definition, I want to hide the last visible column of my table
[02:16:11] <CaptainQuirk> I tried doing 	$(".product-header:visible").last().index();
[02:16:30] <CaptainQuirk> But it gives me the index of the element in the collection of visible cells
[02:16:44] <CaptainQuirk> I would like its position globally
[02:17:02] <Ortund> is the table dynamic? i.e. does it's structure change from time to time (more columns, less columns, etc)
[02:17:50] <Ortund> actually, wouldn't $("table td:last").hide(); do it there CaptainQuirk?
[02:18:06] <reloadz> hi! i made my code work! and a bit my way :) http://pastebin.com/JD0NwaaK
[02:19:16] <CaptainQuirk> No because the last cell could be already hidden
[02:19:22] <CaptainQuirk> I need to hide the last visible one
[02:20:05] <CaptainQuirk> Ortund, no the structure doesn't change
[02:20:48] <Ortund> CaptainQuirk you'll need to iterate through the table's child <td> elements... use .each
[02:21:12] <CaptainQuirk> That's too bad, I thought I could do this on one line
[02:21:30] <Ortund> actually that wouldn't work because that's likely to hide all the cells
[02:31:26] <micz123> hi all, what is the difference between : $this.toggleClass('active');  $this.next().slideToggle('normal');  -and this- $this.toggleClass('active').next().slideToggle('normal');  ? I'm confused bcs the first command works, but the latter doesnt work.
[02:32:05] <Dirkos> I have a global var called "news". Is it possible to execute a function which slides it and continue after it is done? I mean a real function to call and wait till that function is finished
[02:32:41] <micz123> can somebody tell me why the latter is not working? bcs it supposedly works
[02:33:50] <micz123> anybody can help me?
[02:34:33] <Eviltwin> Dirkos: There is not and nor should there be
[02:35:13] <Eviltwin> micz123: Are you sure that's exactly what you have and that it's not working?
[02:36:54] <micz123> eviltwin: yes... Implaying with it in jsfiddle, at first i tried the latter... It doesn't work. But once i convert it to 2 commands (the first), it works
[02:37:14] <Eviltwin> Can you link said jsFiddles?
[02:38:22] <micz123> evitlwin ok one sec, i'll delete the unnecessary ones so u can easily see it
[02:40:26] <micz123> http://jsfiddle.net/gakJ6/
[02:40:37] <micz123> eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/gakJ6/ --> see line 48
[02:41:41] <micz123> eviltwin just click the first button, the second one is not needed... forgot to delete it
[02:42:23] <Eviltwin> micz123: http://jsfiddle.net/UhZUb/
[02:42:33] <Eviltwin> See line 47
[02:43:41] <micz123> eviltwin i give up T_T
[02:45:59] <micz123> eviltwin sometimes this thing gives me creeps... It didn't work before dohhh
[02:46:23] <micz123> I'll try to find the thing before i change it
[02:46:36] <Eviltwin> This is why you isolate your problems
[02:46:45] <Eviltwin> If they're still problems when they're isolated, they're actually problems
[02:52:34] <micz123> http://jsfiddle.net/micz123/TMjXw/ --> line 45, there is no command for error message so it  has less command lines
[02:53:19] <Eviltwin> There's way too much going on here for me to even think about helping you debug it
[02:54:10] <micz123> ah ok, thx and sorry :D
[03:04:37] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/cmEpn/1/  ... can someone help me with my substrings here? They don't seem to be working... Basically, I want everything between the 1st <b> and the 2nd <b> in the div
[03:06:42] <Cork> Ortund: uh, i'm not even sure what you expect src.html().indexOf($("weather-feed b:nth-child(1)")) to give you
[03:07:13] <Ortund> lol Cork, I was looking for the position of the first <b> in src
[03:07:18] <Cork> you can't use a dom element position in an array as a substr index for a string search
[03:07:31] <Cork> Ortund: you will have to use regex string search
[03:07:39] <Cork> you can't use dom to search in a string
[03:07:43] <Ortund> fark, I don't know how to do that :/
[03:07:57] <Ortund> thought it was bad to regex string search...
[03:08:14] <Cork> Ortund: first pick out the weather-feed instead of the entire html
[03:08:24] <Cork> then just search for <br> in it
[03:08:30] <Cork> grab the x occurance
[03:08:42] <Cork> should be about the same as what your trying to do there
[03:09:06] <Ortund> problem is I've never been able to get my head around regex
[03:09:31] <Ortund> i understand the concept, but I just can't figure out how to apply it correctly... tutorials just confuse me
[03:12:32] <aMoniker> Ortund: www.regex101.com and www.regexpal.com
[03:15:12] <Ortund> seems to me a simpler solution would be to parse the source string into an array and deal with each array item in turn
[03:16:53] <Ortund> aMoniker thanks for the links, but I don't have even half a clue what my regex should maybe look like...
[03:17:12] <aMoniker> Ortund: you can build it interactively with regex101 and it will explain it to you
[03:17:13] <fabioportieri> hi, can i specify more than one event with on() ? like  $('input.trigger').on('change, paste', function(e) { });
[03:17:21] <aMoniker> Ortund: What are you trying to match?
[03:17:40] <aMoniker> fabioportieri: $('element').on('change click mouseover', function() {});
[03:17:47] <fabioportieri> aMoniker: thanks
[03:19:27] <Ortund> aMoniker not really sure of that either... basically all I want to do is to get the indexOf the 1st and 2nd <b> tags in the html contents of the div
[03:19:44] <aMoniker> so you know the div you want
[03:20:27] <aMoniker> why do you need the indexOf ?
[03:22:40] <aMoniker> that is, what do you want to do with the first two <b> tags?
[03:23:42] <Ortund> aMoniker http://jsfiddle.net/cmEpn/2/
[03:24:04] <Ortund> I basically want to surround the sections (conditions, forecast, etc) with divs
[03:24:38] <Ortund> the source html comes out of yahoo's weather api
[03:25:23] <Ortund> once I have the new divs in place, I can style it however I want
[03:27:11] <Ortund> so my idea was to write a substring of "first <b> tag to second <b> tag" to get the weather conditions
[03:27:28] <Ortund> but according to Cork, this can't be substring'd
[03:28:16] <Cork> Ortund: no, what i said is you can't use  jquery selectors to locate things in a html string
[03:29:31] <Ortund> Cork, so could my idea work if I used src.find(b:nth-child(1)) ?
[03:30:09] <Cork> Ortund: yes, but that will only get you the content in the b tag
[03:30:14] <Cork> not around it
[03:30:44] <Ortund> damn
[03:30:45] <Cork> <b>this content is what you can get</b>
[03:31:01] <Ortund> I thought I was just reading this as a string...
[03:31:35] <Cork> Ortund: when you're working with the live page, you're working with dom, not html
[03:32:03] <Cork> when you serialize the dom to a string (.html()) its just a string of text
[03:32:30] <Ortund> I'd do this in php, but my splits there on "\r\n" or "\n" didn't work...
[03:33:41] <Ortund> that's normally how I handle such operations... I split the full string into an array on a common character and evaluate and modify each array item individually
[03:33:47] <Cork> Ortund: you want the Mostly Cloudy, 19 C section?
[03:34:48] <Ortund> yes
[03:42:17] <kracekumar> how can quote string using jquery, if a string is "{"chapter": 2}"
[03:42:38] <Clex> kracekumar: '{"chapter": 2}'
[03:42:53] <Clex> Or "{\"chapter\": 2}"
[03:43:54] <Cork> Ortund: you really need to start defining your variables!
[03:43:55] <kracekumar> Clex, problem is I pass the value '{"key": val}' to js func, but after receiving the value console.log(param) yields "{"key": val}"
[03:43:56] <Cork> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/cmEpn/17/
[03:44:51] <Cork> ?eval String.quote('{"key": val}')
[03:44:55] <bot-t> Cork: "\"{\\"key\\": val}\""
[03:45:05] <Cork> kracekumar: ^
[03:45:17] <palominoz> hello there. I am currently defining the data access layer of a fat javascript client. This layer must support event-driven async ajax requests . I am currently thinking about extending the same pattern as $.ajax provides, returning promises and managing operations at each level of abstraction, in particular exception handling. Does anyone of you guys can suggest nice reads about this topic?
[03:47:15] <Cork> kracekumar: also what you see from console.log looks borked
[03:47:17] <aMoniker> palominoz: why not use a pubsub model + $.ajax() ?
[03:47:35] <Cork> kracekumar: cause if that was true, the variable couldn't hold it
[03:48:18] <palominoz> aMoniker: i dont know what is pubsub. currently googleing it
[03:49:23] <aMoniker> palominoz: some object subscribes to a user-defined event, then other parts of the code fire off that event
[03:49:37] <davetarmac> hey guys - I'm having trouble with the MetroJS library
[03:49:38] <aMoniker> all subscribers receive the event and execute whatever code
[03:49:38] <kracekumar> Cork, my mistake it comes from template engine so it double quoted. ypeError: Object function String() { [native code] } has no method 'quote'
[03:49:51] <Ortund> Cork, you mean you can't implcitely define the variable just by result = "this"; ?
[03:50:12] <chilversc_> jquery mobile, is it possible to create an inline checkbox, ideally one that only shows the check
[03:50:25] <Cork> Orphis: sure, but result = "this"; is the EXACT same thing as doing window.result = "this";
[03:50:25] <palominoz> aMoniker: @ ui level there is knockout that manages that kind of work
[03:50:28] <davetarmac> I need to get this http://jsfiddle.net/sHbPS/ so that the tile that says Executive changes first, then triggers a cascade going right, but I cna't get the animationComplete() to work
[03:50:37] <Cork> Ortund: and that means it's page global
[03:50:56] <Cork> Ortund: just add a var infront
[03:51:11] <davetarmac> here is the reference for MetroJS http://www.drewgreenwell.com/projects/metrojs#liveTileOptions
[03:51:18] <palominoz> aMoniker: I am currently defining the data access. That means we have models, and we want to fill them with data from the server
[03:51:37] <palominoz> aMoniker: the GUI update is already ok.
[03:55:47] <gotwig> hey
[03:58:00] <godwinh> is there any way that I could check if my an element is bound to a function which in my case is checking if the element is bound to a fancybox
[03:58:28] <_Fuse_> i all
[03:59:16] <_Fuse_> i would like selet all element with id like "my-id-*". What can i do for this?
[04:00:03] <godwinh> is there any way that I could check if my an element is bound to a function which in my case is checking if the element is bound to a fancybox
[04:02:06] <Ortund> thanks Cork!
[04:02:55] <Ortund> hmmm $(".weather-feed").append(result); doesn't seem to be rendering anything though
[04:03:30] <manuelbieh> hey
[04:03:38] <manuelbieh> which one is faster in my case?
[04:03:44] <manuelbieh> $('.foo .bar').hide();
[04:03:46] <manuelbieh> or
[04:03:54] <manuelbieh> $('.foo').find('.bar').hide();
[04:04:06] <manuelbieh> probably #1 i guess?
[04:04:09] <godwinh> is there any way that I could check if my an element is bound to a function which in my case is checking if the element is bound to a fancybox
[04:04:48] <_Fuse_> ok auto response: a[id^='detail-bundle']
[04:04:59] <manuelbieh> element bound to a function or the other way round?
[04:05:14] <godwinh> check if an element is bound to a function/jquery plugin
[04:05:26] <Ortund> manuelbieh I wouldn't imagine the speed difference would be anything to worry about one way or another really
[04:05:29] <manuelbieh> if you used jquery for event binding you could try to find the function in $('element').data('events');
[04:06:04] <godwinh> okay let me check
[04:09:32] <godwinh> returns undefined
[04:10:19] <godwinh> because my element is bound to a fancybox and I need to check if it is bound or not
[04:11:14] <manuelbieh> yes. i just discovered it was removed in jquery 1.8
[04:11:43] <godwinh> oh! I am running 1.8.3
[04:11:58] <manuelbieh> This is now removed in 1.8, but you can still get to the events data for debugging purposes via $._data(element, "events")
[04:12:47] <manuelbieh> $._data($('a').get(0), "events")
[04:12:52] <manuelbieh> Object {click: Array[1]}
[04:12:56] <manuelbieh> works fine for me
[04:13:45] <godwinh> can you send me a link to the documentation? I need it for future references as well
[04:14:52] <manuelbieh> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/09/jquery-1-8-released/
[04:14:52] <Cork> there is not documentation
[04:14:56] <Cork> cause its not supported
[04:15:02] <manuelbieh> in the What’s Been Removed section ;)
[04:15:21] <Cork> its an internal api, that is discouraged for external use
[04:16:16] <godwinh> manuelbieh: thanks! ;)
[04:16:37] <manuelbieh> when i got him right he just needs a way to find out if his fancy box events are bound correctly
[04:17:00] <manuelbieh> so better dont use it in production code since it's an internal api
[04:24:40] <sjeijk> sup guys, have any of you ever worked with riloadr or foresight for responsive images?
[04:37:48] <gotwig> Does someone of you use Gridster.js?
[04:38:12] <gotwig> What about porting it to jQuery 1.9.1/ 2.0 ?
[04:38:14] <gotwig> http://jsfiddle.net/agryson/Lp6sB/10/
[04:47:51] <Ortund> Cork, I hope I understood the concept correctly from your example: http://jsfiddle.net/DPWAX/
[04:48:14] <Ortund> unfortunately, it doesn't look like I did coz nothing new is rendering
[04:48:56] <Cork> Ortund: no
[04:49:13] <Cork> you have to either use dom or html you can't have an html string and append dom to it result += src.find("b:nth-child(1)").before("<div class=\"weather-conditions\">");
[04:49:59] <Cork> i'm not even sure what var result = src.find("br").remove(); is meant to do
[04:50:07] <Cork> remove returns null
[04:50:19] <Cork> and you're removing br from the original dom
[04:52:21] <Ortund> Cork, that's supposed to remove all <br /> tags in the div coz I don't need them
[04:52:35] <Cork> ya, but why are you setting result?
[04:53:18] <Ortund> the idea was to build a new div (result) and replace the original (src) with it
[04:53:37] <Ortund> but obviously I'm battling to distinguish between working with the html and working with the dom
[04:53:50] <Cork> Ortund: so just var result = '';
[04:54:27] <Ortund> I'm not following you
[04:54:29] <Ortund> :(
[04:56:16] <Cork> Ortund: give me a sec
[04:59:23] <Cork> Ortund: what part are you looking for in the forcast link?
[04:59:42] <pedda> hi there
[04:59:52] <pedda> someone experienced with isotope plugin?
[04:59:55] <Ortund> Cork, exactly what it's got
[05:00:05] <Ortund> just needs to be in a div
[05:00:20] <pedda> i don't get why it doesn't work as expected in my project...
[05:00:23] <Cork> Ortund: so the Full Forecast at Yahoo! Weather ?
[05:00:32] <Ortund> yes
[05:00:32] <pedda> i want to arrang and rearrange images with it on resize..
[05:00:58] <pedda> atm it actually does add css classes to the affected elements (works kinda) but the images are not scaled by the plugin..
[05:01:36] <pedda> it should scale down too big images afaik
[05:01:40] <pedda> but it does not
[05:05:53] <Cork> Ortund: have you actually tested that src.html().match(/<b>([^<]*)<a/) works?
[05:05:56] <Cork> it doens't match anything
[05:07:23] <Cork> ah you missed the escape
[05:07:31] <Ortund> which one?
[05:08:46] <Ortund> was just checking out your initial regex, Cork... http://www.regex101.com/r/vQ5kT3
[05:09:55] <Cork> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/DPWAX/1/
[05:10:07] <Cork> there, i think that is what you're tying to do
[05:10:23] <Cork> opps missed a test thing
[05:10:44] <Cork> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/DPWAX/2/
[05:15:23] <Ortund> awesome :) how far off was I?
[05:16:29] <Ortund> Also, wondering how to preserve just that 1 <br /> between the lines in the forecast... I had thought of matching [0-9] [a-z][A-Z] or something and replacing the space there with the <br />
[05:18:31] <Cork> Ortund: quit a bit
[05:18:47] <Cork> Ortund: your mixing up whats html and whats dom
[05:19:08] <Cork> and all the find().after() lines didn't make any sense at all
[05:21:10] <Ortund> Cork, this is all I have to do for the next 2 hours lol... also, I'm pretty sure I was mixing up dom/html from the start, but you may have a point, time for a break
[05:24:07] <Cork> Ortund: as its as broken as that, your prob better of just adding a new one
[05:26:30] <Cork> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/DPWAX/3/
[05:27:12] <Cork> Ortund: might be nicer to just do http://jsfiddle.net/DPWAX/4/
[05:29:40] <Ortund> I really do go after the hardest possible way to do things, don't I?
[05:30:41] <Cork> :)
[05:31:19] <davetarmac> using MetroJS script, is thre a way to add a delay AFTER each animation stage?
[05:39:02] <ankr> Is there an easy way to detect if an element **or any of its children** is clicked?
[05:39:23] <ankr> In the click handler callback that is ^
[05:40:55] <krusty_ar> ankr: if the event isn't explicitly stopped from propagation, just handle the top level element's event and look at event.target (event being the paramenter to the handler) for the actual clicked element
[05:41:21] <krusty_ar> also take a look at "event delegation"
[05:42:22] <ankr> krusty_ar, my issue is that I have a popup. I want to close that popup whenever a click appears - provided that the click is not triggered on `myElement` or any of its children.
[05:43:39] <Cork> ankr: just bind an event listener to the element, and if its triggered your question is true
[05:43:57] <krusty_ar> you can probably find a better way, but close the window on a click to the body element (or html) and on your element make a handler that just stops propagation
[05:44:10] <xec> davetarmac: i don't have any experience with metrojs, but if it's using the jquery animation queue, you can see ?delay
[05:44:11] <bot-t> davetarmac, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[05:44:39] <ankr> Cork, but I want to be able to register the click anywhere on the page, so I'm binding the handler to `document`.
[05:44:47] <ankr> Maybe I'm missing something here?
[05:45:24] <Cork> ankr: so $(document).on('click', 'div span, div span *', function() {})
[05:50:20] <Ortund> heh Cork, really glad styling this thing is more straight-forward than making it possible to style it was :P thanks a million for your help
[05:50:24] <davetarmac> xec: I tried that, but it didn't work
[05:50:26] <ankr> Cork, I found a solution http://jsfiddle.net/ankr/ZdnDL/
[05:50:38] <Cork> Ortund: yw
[05:51:11] <Cork> ankr: uh... why not just do the same thing with delegate?
[05:51:33] <Cork> ankr: so $(document).on('click', 'div span, div span *', function() {}) <--
[05:53:58] <Cork> ankr: to make our selector it would be $(document).on('click', '#clickMe *', function() {})
[05:54:04] <Cork> same thing with much cleaner code
[05:58:53] <jehee> http://jsbin.com/ubodim/2/edit when I hover a img element in the class div menu-article-item. I want the h3 inside that div to change colour. Not all the other h3's. How can I do this?
[06:00:47] <ankr> Cork, it's kinda the opposite I want to achieve - I want to register clicks that are *NOT* within my element or its children.
[06:00:48] <jehee> should it be something like this? Psuedo: $(this).menu-article-item > h3 .css() ?
[06:01:46] <Ortund> Cork, I think I'll be making a post about this one on my website. I'll make sure you're credited for your substantial input :)
[06:02:29] <ra21vi> I need to apply Placeholder polyfill on my input. But the input elements are added dynamcally. How can I bind a function to be run on input when it is added to DOM?
[06:06:30] <sjeijk> sup guys, have any of you ever worked with riloadr or foresight for responsive images?
[06:14:47] <jehee> <div class="select"><h3>Test</h3><img src="" /></div>. How can I change colour of the h3 when hovering the img?
[06:15:34] <Nemurenai> jehee, hover: http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[06:15:39] <jehee> $('.select').children('h3').css('color','red');
[06:15:43] <jehee> I tried this within my hover function
[06:15:51] <jehee> but it attacks all h3's
[06:15:57] <jehee> I have different select divs with same structure
[06:16:52] <Nemurenai> jehee, either make the h3 unique with a class or id, or use the :first pseudoselector
[06:17:40] <jehee> the h3 cannot be unique. I have to use :first then
[06:18:53] <boytoy_> jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/pages/docs-pages.html says: Inside the <body> tag, each view or "page" on the mobile device is identified with an element (usually a div) with the data-role="page" attribute.
[06:19:10] <jehee> Nemurenai first wont work either.
[06:19:17] <jehee> Ill paste some code to give you a view of the problem
[06:19:24] <Nemurenai> ok
[06:19:33] <boytoy_> Should ones main front page content also be in a data-role="page" div, or just additional views / pages?
[06:20:31] <jehee> Nemurenai: http://jsfiddle.net/fcrhj/
[06:20:33] <chilversc_> is there a version of .unwrap() that removes the selected nodes but keeps the children?
[06:23:30] <Nemurenai> ah
[06:23:47] <Nemurenai> jehee, find the parent of the hovered image, then descend
[06:23:48] <Nemurenai> like this:
[06:24:13] <chilversc_> best I found was .contents().unwrap()
[06:24:17] <Nemurenai> $(this).closest(".menu-article-item").find("h3")
[06:24:48] <jehee> Numerenai great thank you
[06:25:07] <Nemurenai> jehee, np
[06:33:28] <shwaiil> hi
[06:34:08] <shwaiil> Q: .browser is deprecated, I'd like to run a small script if nth-child not supported. How to check that through .support ? Tks for looking!
[06:35:57] <chilversc_> shwaiil: you mean nth-child in css rather than in jquery?
[06:36:24] <shwaiil> chilversc_: tks for looking. yes, css support for nth-child, so I can run jquery if not.
[06:37:00] <chilversc_> shwaiil: looks like there's a few feature detection scripts out there for modernizer, which seems the best place to detect that
[06:37:01] <shwaiil> I used to check .browser  version but is now deprecated, so I'm wondering how to check for nth-child support through jquery .support instead.
[06:37:11] <ravenzz> you could use conditional comments to add a .lt-ie9 class to the html or body tag
[06:37:25] <ravenzz> then try to select it and check against its length
[06:37:48] <ravenzz> http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sel3
[06:38:21] <Trisox> modernzer ;)
[06:38:21] <shwaiil> ravenzz: tks for looking. yes looks like the best choice.
[06:38:29] <ravenzz> or Modernizr
[06:38:35] <Trisox> idd
[06:39:29] <chilversc_> I see a pull request to add that to modernizer that can probably be adapted https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/685
[06:39:33] <b-ot> chilversc_: Pull request #685 by emilchristensen (6mon 3d ago): Add feature detect for nth-child()
[06:39:53] <chilversc_> and there's several SO posts for that feature such as http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7630408/how-to-test-for-nth-child-using-modernizr
[06:41:10] <ravenzz> chilversc yeah it has not been merged yet
[06:41:13] <shwaiil> for my case, without having to load modernizr, the conditions that ravenzz suggested looks like the best choice. otherwise if still supported i'd stick with .browser. just trying to keep the app size small ;)
[06:41:33] <shwaiil> tks for looking!
[06:42:20] <ravenzz> thanks*
[06:43:23] <chilversc_> shwaiil: modernizer is the better way though, since it uses feature detection to see if the feature really exists
[06:43:42] <chilversc_> and what's wrong with loading modernizer?
[06:44:01] <ravenzz> chilversc_ it is without the e :P
[06:44:48] <shwaiil> chilversc_: nothing wrong, just a personal choice keeping small size. I'd use modernizr just for testing that feature. In this case, the ie conditionals is enough, no need to load modernizr.
[06:45:15] <ravenzz> shwaiil you can always rip from Modernizr and adjust it so you don't need the whole lib
[06:45:31] <shwaiil> if I need to test for more feaures, yes, I'll load it and use it instead.
[06:45:41] <shwaiil> ravenzz: yes truth, but no need to complicate in this case. thanks
[06:45:43] <chilversc_> shwaiil: you can customize modernizr though, so strip it back to just the core, addtest, teststyles, and the other features you need
[06:46:03] <shwaiil> chilversc_: yes, it looks there's many choices and options. nice.
[06:46:10] <chilversc_> shwaiil: that or you could take the code for that test, and just put it right in your app, then adapt it to a simple function that returns true/false
[06:46:52] <ravenzz> anyway that feature it can't be detected by Modernizr yet, so for another solution of your choice.
[06:47:06] <chilversc_> its mostly the concept of detecting the feature rather than the browser, so just use that code as an example for how to detect the feature
[06:47:13] <ravenzz> feature detection is of course better than the class thing
[06:52:03] <dersand> Hi, I am looking for a solution. I have a variable containing something I want to search on Google with, let's say "a dog". How do I get my anchor tag on click redricct me too Google.com/(my search term a dog)?
[06:53:22] <shwaiil> dersand: search?q=KEYWORD
[06:53:38] <Nemurenai> dersand, set an onclick handler where you set window.location and return false
[06:54:33] <dersand> I think I will brake it because it contains a space
[06:55:50] <discorpia> dersand: it shouldn't, but you can always substitute the space for a +
[06:56:19] <discorpia> using regular escape/urlencode

[07:15:09] <apeiros_> is there a nicer way?
[07:15:30] <apeiros_> (the fail: it considers the html to be a selector and then chokes because as a selector, it is invalid)

[07:21:13] <apeiros_> I only create the nodes
[07:21:14] <Trisox> i see
[07:21:38] <apeiros_> and $('<div>') uses $.parseHTML under the hood, but returns a jQuery object

[07:23:15] <Trisox> apeiros_: your looking for createElement but than with jquery
[07:23:20] <Trisox> im i right
[07:24:23] <jdummy> Why doesn't this turn the background green?  http://jsfiddle.net/nGgzy/  Anyone?
[07:24:46] <apeiros_> Trisox: not sure I understand your statement correctly
[07:24:55] <apeiros_> yes, I want to create elements, and I want those elements to be wrapped with jQuery
[07:25:03] <apeiros_> so that I can call e.g. .clone() on it
[07:25:08] <rabbi1> kindly some one kick my arse ..
[07:25:20] * apeiros_ kicks rabbi1's arse kindly
[07:25:27] <apeiros_> you're welcome ;-)
[07:25:48] <rabbi1> pachet: there was a typo â€¦ :( gosh
[07:26:04] <pachet> jdummy: http://jsfiddle.net/n3KzE/
[07:26:07] <rabbi1> need some more taps
[07:26:11] <pachet> .wrapAll() clones the element
[07:26:19] <pachet> and then you set the color on the original, not the clone
[07:26:53] <Trisox> apeiros_: you want to creat a div but not atach it to the dom
[07:27:02] <Trisox> *create
[07:27:18] <jdummy> pachet: gotcha.  I thought I was going crazy.

[07:29:16] <user_corrupt> ok, so I installed easy fancybox plugin for wordpress, and the problem that i am having is that fancybox doesnt open to full screen width on iphones... i wish that I had access to some css/javascript debugging tool for iphone but unfortunately i do not.. any ideas? here is a demo of the problem: http://www.regimechangeusa.org/genesis/
[07:29:17] <djQuery> Trisox, something wouldn't be a jquery object at that point so .addClass wouldn't work
[07:29:35] <Trisox> hmm
[07:29:47] <djQuery> Trisox, if you just define it correctly jquery creates the element fine in ie   $(
[07:30:02] <Trisox> so if div is created and not atached jquery to it
[07:30:12] <Trisox> atached to the dom
[07:30:27] <djQuery> '$('<div></div>', {'class': 'someclass'}).appendTo('whateverselector')
[07:30:34] <djQuery> Trisox, ^^6
[07:30:54] <Trisox> smart passing it like that
[07:31:04] <Trisox> didnt know that would work
[07:31:19] <djQuery> Trisox, yeah cuts down on calls
[07:31:56] <Trisox> same principle as .css({ })
[07:32:09] <djQuery> Trisox, if you don't close out the div it will have a prob in IE
[07:32:18] <Trisox> right yea i know ;)(
[07:32:56] <djQuery> user_corrupt, sorry aint got any either
[07:33:00] <Trisox> so passing object literals works
[07:33:41] <apeiros_> Trisox: sorry, got interrupted at work, reading backlog
[07:33:51] <Trisox> i'm sure var something = document.createElement('div');  $(something).addClass('something'); should work also
[07:34:00] <Trisox> djQuery:
[07:34:15] <djQuery> Trisox, yeah    this even works $('<div></div>', {class: 'w', css: {'text-allign': 'center', display: 'block{}
[07:34:26] <ra21vi> is there any way to watch for new dom element add, and apply some func on it? I need to apply polyfill on new added input..
[07:34:26] <Trisox> ah right!
[07:34:30] <djQuery> opps wrong } at the end there but u get the drift
[07:34:39] <Trisox> i got the point ;)
[07:34:46] <djQuery> ?newcontent@ra21v
[07:34:47] <bot-t> ra21v, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[07:34:57] <apeiros_> Trisox: yes, correct. I use jquery to create nodes, and I do not attach them to the DOM. And a change in jquery caused the overloaded function to wrongly detect the html as a css selector.
[07:35:19] <apeiros_> i.e., $(myHtml) doesn't try to parse it as HTML but as a CSS Selector (only since 1.9)
[07:35:19] <djQuery> ra21vi, it needs some updating to use the new .on   but it basicaly works
[07:35:20] <Trisox> apeiros_: see discusion ;)
[07:35:41] <apeiros_> Trisox: the 'IE doesn't create elements' one? doesn't seem relatedâ€¦
[07:36:05] <ra21vi> djQuery: I think .on cannot be used here
[07:36:54] <djQuery> apeiros_, hmmm I am using it on line 8 here just fine. but I don't have an ie machine to test on http://jsbin.com/upajog/1/edit
[07:36:59] <apeiros_> Trisox: ok, read the discussion. that's definitively not related.
[07:37:06] <Trisox> ie doesnt accept self enclosing tags like on <div class="something"/> but expects <div class="something"></div>
[07:37:11] <ra21vi> djQuery: for example, change bgcolor to RED for newly added input if their class is ABC.. How can I bind with .on()
[07:37:18] <apeiros_> djQuery: yes, for certain cases it works fine. but for this one it goes haywire.
[07:37:30] <Trisox> same goes if you render that in html..
[07:37:34] <djQuery> ra21vi, dunno
[07:37:36] <apeiros_> first thing I did was see whether $('<div>foo</div>') still did what I expected, and it does.
[07:37:53] <djQuery> ra21vi, how are the elements being added?
[07:38:14] <apeiros_> djQuery, Trisox: the point is that $() is overloaded to do multiple things. in order to do that, it has to detect whether the first argument is a CSS selector or a piece of HTML. and in my case it used to detect it correctly. now it no longer does.
[07:38:41] <Trisox> hmm
[07:38:41] <ra21vi> djQuery: with User interaction. Like on comment btn click, comment input box is added.. etc.
[07:38:46] <apeiros_> to avoid that, for now and the future, I wanted to use an explicit function. $.parseHTML seemed to be that. but it differs from $() in that it doesn't wrap the result in a jQuery object.
[07:39:01] <djQuery> apeiros_, I think the key is that it contians <sometext>  as I don't belive that is a valid css selector
[07:39:19] <apeiros_> djQuery: I. Know.
[07:39:45] <Trisox> right
[07:39:48] <ra21vi> djQuery: I need to apply the Placeholder polyfill for non-html5 browsers who does not support Placeholder yet. So for added <input> i have to run a function..
[07:39:54] <apeiros_> it is *not* a css selector.
[07:40:00] <djQuery> ra21vi, look how I do it here http://jsbin.com/upajog/1/edit
[07:40:01] <apeiros_> jquery *thinks* it is one
[07:40:21] <amph1bius> well look at the jquery source and find out why it thinks it is one
[07:40:33] <djQuery> ra21vi, see how I am applying .button to it before hand then later adding it to the dom
[07:40:49] <apeiros_> amph1bius: no. wrong path. I don't want jquery to guess. not now, not in the future. it is obviously error prone.
[07:40:50] <Trisox> lol djQuery
[07:40:58] <Virunga> awesome nick djQuery xD
[07:40:58] <apeiros_> I want to use an explicit function.
[07:41:10] <apeiros_> for the moment I use $($.parseHTML(myHtml))
[07:41:25] <apeiros_> but that's ugly as a sin, hence I ask whether there's a nicer way to do that
[07:41:35] <apeiros_> i.e., be explicit that I want to parse html and get a jQuery object back
[07:41:44] <djQuery> apeiros_, sorry I cam to the party late
[07:41:59] <amph1bius> well, look at the source and find out why it is doing it
[07:42:08] <amph1bius> stop being lazy.
[07:42:11] <ra21vi> djQuery: oh that I do everytime :)
[07:42:20] * apeiros_ rolls eyes, gives up, writes a helper which wraps $($.parseHTML(myHtml))
[07:42:26] <ra21vi> djQuery: but currently my situation is little more complex.
[07:42:28] * apeiros_ additionally adds amph1bius to his ignore-list
[07:42:39] <amph1bius> who uses /me these days.  kids.
[07:42:47] <djQuery> go ahead and add me as well
[07:42:56] <Trisox> jQuery.parseHTML uses a native DOM element creation function to convert the string to a set of DOM elements, which can then be inserted into the document.
[07:42:57] <amph1bius> he is trolling
[07:43:00] * Virunga stands the arm
[07:43:27] <Trisox> right like i said .. document.createElement
[07:43:38] <djQuery> Trisox, aint seen u in a while
[07:43:47] <Trisox> i know men
[07:44:14] <Trisox> bought a house so not much time
[07:44:28] <amph1bius> congrats
[07:44:31] <amph1bius> where are you located Trisox
[07:44:32] <apeiros_> Trisox: you can't use document.createElement the same way you can use $.parseHTML. and it doesn't return a jQuery object either.
[07:44:45] <Trisox> no but you can pass it in one
[07:44:48] <djQuery> Trisox, bought one 8 years ago and still owe almost as much as I bought it for
[07:44:52] <Trisox> and its native so faster
[07:45:07] <Trisox> :)
[07:45:26] <djQuery> dang 10 years ago
[07:45:27] <amph1bius> i'm nearing the age where i need to buy a house/condo :(
[07:45:30] <Trisox> lol :)
[07:45:32] <apeiros_> Trisox: that's entirely pointless. you don't want to decompose '<foo attr="a">bar<nested>baz</nested></foo>' into a series of DOM function calls
[07:45:48] <Trisox> apeiros_: agreed
[07:45:50] <apeiros_> $.parseHTML('<foo attr="a">bar<nested>baz</nested></foo>') does that just fine.
[07:46:00] <apeiros_> so no, createElement is definitively *not* what I want.
[07:46:08] <Trisox> djQuery: got it 21e so bizzy doing handymen work
[07:46:12] <Trisox> painiting and stuff
[07:46:46] <djQuery> Trisox, been thinking of moving into RV and renting the house out
[07:46:54] <Trisox> rv?
[07:47:12] <djQuery> take rental $ and my usual payment and pay off house early
[07:47:13] <Trisox> wy in a rv :)
[07:47:26] <djQuery> cheap
[07:47:34] <Trisox> right
[07:48:01] <Trisox> got a big house then?
[07:48:26] <Trisox> brb taking a leak
[07:48:29] <djQuery> just 1769 square feet
[07:48:40] <amph1bius> that's a good size house.  1 person ?
[07:48:51] <djQuery> no
[07:51:02] <Trisox> i got 1453 ft
[07:52:56] <omani_> I have several radio buttons within <ul>. I want to slide toggle each <ul> that belongs to a question that's in a <p>. when I say $('p').next('.class_of_ul').slideToggle() it toggles every <ul>s of every question (so every <p>)
[07:53:09] <omani_> how can I explicitly say that it is the next <ul>. not all.
[07:53:21] <djQuery> ra21vi, what I have done in the past is create a function that will do all the manipulation and run it through that before adding it to the dom
[07:53:35] <basiclaser> .next()
[07:53:43] <thinboy> Hi guys, check out my code to convert my main nav to a dropdown in mobile vew. http://jsfiddle.net/PjVnV/ can anyone help me how to add "--" on the sub items ("li ul li a")? Really need your help.
[07:53:58] <omani_> basiclaser: yeah I do use it
[07:54:02] <omani_> but it opens everything
[07:54:18] <djQuery> omani_, see ?demo
[07:54:18] <bot-t> omani_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:54:42] <basiclaser> try $('parent > ul:first') ?
[07:55:31] <djQuery> omani_, $(this).closest('p').find('ul').slideToggle();
[07:55:32] <ronfaith> hi guys.. i have a problem with the autocomplete.. i need to add fields dinamically and it seems that everytime i add a new field im not able to assign values next to each field using css selectors.. for some reason it set the same value for each field.. http://jsfiddle.net/UQUT7/
[07:56:41] <omani_> djQuery: I will try that
[07:56:44] <omani_> http://jsfiddle.net/6ENBM/
[07:56:55] <omani_> it seems that my javascript does not work with jsfiddle
[07:56:58] <omani_> but in my code it works.
[07:57:02] <omani_> did I forget something?
[07:57:06] <omani_> in the javascript box?
[07:57:30] <Trisox> omani_: load jquery ;)
[07:57:38] <djQuery> omani_, so if they click on foo its supposed to slidetoggle the checks?
[07:57:53] <amph1bius> ronfaith: i believe you need to use on()
[07:58:08] <Trisox> omani_: your html is not valid
[07:58:26] <omani_> Trisox: I know. it's for testing reasons
[07:58:28] <Trisox> oh wait :)
[07:58:55] <omani_> djQuery: the uls are hidden by default (display: none)
[07:59:12] <omani_> and when I click on one question it shall toggle down the next <ul> to it
[08:00:18] <ronfaith> amph1bius:  how.. any example?
[08:03:13] <omani_> djQuery: your code does not work
[08:03:34] <Trisox> omani_: fix your html
[08:03:34] <omani_> $(this).closest('p').find('ul').slideToggle();
[08:03:41] <omani_> Trisox: what do you mean?
[08:04:24] <djQuery> omani_, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/6ENBM/1/    works fine here
[08:04:50] <djQuery> omani_, it all depends on how your dom is made and I did not know it till u gave your link
[08:05:39] <omani_> djQuery: what's up with the second foo?
[08:05:47] <omani_> why does that not toggle?
[08:05:51] <djQuery> omani_, this will even work if you want to be a little more specific http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/6ENBM/2/
[08:06:07] <djQuery> omani_, I didn't give it the class q
[08:06:45] <djQuery> omani_, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/6ENBM/3/
[08:06:54] <omani_> ok thanks
[08:07:31] <omani_> is it better to use onclick in javascript instead of onclick="javafunction()" in html tag?
[08:07:45] <djQuery> omani_, prefrence
[08:08:01] <djQuery> omani_, seperation of code
[08:08:05] <chilversc_> jquery mobile and requirejs really don't like each other, they just want to work in completly opposite ways
[08:08:20] <omani_> ok
[08:09:18] <amph1bius> chilversc: why is that ?
[08:09:22] <amph1bius> good morning NoiseEee
[08:09:34] <NoiseEee> hello
[08:09:37] <chilversc_> amph1bius: jquery mobile seems to require me to initialize everything before loading jquery mobile
[08:10:01] <chilversc_> amph1bius: so when using requirejs you've normally missed the pageinit event
[08:10:16] <ronfaith> so my question is if i could do something like $(this).next().val(ui.item.id); with the rest of values im setting in this example http://jsfiddle.net/UQUT7/
[08:11:32] <chilversc_> though jqm also doesn't seem to like the idea of loading scripts as required for a page, so you have to load all the js for the site on the first page
[08:13:25] <djQuery> ronfaith, have u tried console.log(ui.item)?
[08:13:52] <ronfaith> djQuery: why
[08:14:00] <djQuery> to see what it is
[08:14:16] <shawn_dones> hello everyone
[08:14:40] <shawn_dones> i am new to jquery and am in need of some serious help
[08:14:48] <ronfaith> djQuery:  i know what the problem is.. but as im generating the autocomplete fields dinamically.. it always adds the the same values for the last created
[08:15:28] <omani_> how can I use the value of a radio button in my ajax handler?
[08:15:52] <amph1bius> chilversc
[08:15:54] <amph1bius> ah
[08:16:26] <omani_> http://jsfiddle.net/ZmnMn/
[08:16:28] <thinboy> Hi sir I converted my Navigation from <ul> to <select> in mobile view. Can anyone tell how how to add "--" on the sub menu? (li ul li a)
[08:16:42] <Trisox> omani_: ?serialize
[08:16:47] <djQuery> chilversc, does jqm have an init method you can call manualy?
[08:16:51] <Trisox> ?serialize
[08:16:52] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:17:12] <chilversc_> djQuery: yes, but that is for the whole framework not an individual page
[08:17:35] <shawn_dones> can anyone tell me how to do this vertically? http://jqueryui.com/slider/#side-scroll
[08:17:35] <chilversc_> djQuery: so now I have to delay starting the app until everything is loaded, even for pages that are not currently visible
[08:17:54] <omani_> Trisox: is that string in my GET path then?
[08:18:08] <chilversc_> djQuery: otherwise you could get; enough loaded for main page, init jqm, user follows link to next page yet next page hasn't finished loading scripts yet, so it misses the initpage event
[08:18:09] <omani_> or what do I do with that string?
[08:18:25] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/ZmnMn/1/
[08:18:32] <djQuery> omani_, ^^
[08:18:47] <Trisox> it returns the same as you would do a normal post
[08:18:51] <chilversc_> djQuery: no way to tell jqm that the scripts for that page havn't finished initializing yet so delay loading that page for a bit longer
[08:19:03] <omani_> ah nice
[08:19:10] <Trisox> djQuery: you dont need to baby feed him ;)
[08:19:12] <omani_> man I begin to like jquery more and more
[08:19:16] <omani_> helpful. thx
[08:19:26] <Trisox> or bird feed
[08:19:45] <djQuery> Trisox, I love thowing up in other peoples mouth
[08:19:48] <Trisox> omani_: read the doc's ;-) gives you better understanding
[08:19:50] <omani_> Trisox: no. as a noob I am depended on some help
[08:19:52] <thinboy> Hi sir I converted my Navigation from <ul> to <select> in mobile view. Can anyone tell how how to add "--" on the sub menu? (li ul li a)
[08:19:53] <Trisox> haha djQuery
[08:20:08] <thinboy> Please help
[08:20:08] <chilversc_> jquery mobile just doesn't seem to be designed around the concept of the scripts loading asynchronously
[08:20:14] <djQuery> omani_, looks like you need to do a general jquery tut though   http://try.jquery.com
[08:20:23] <omani_> djQuery: yes. I will do that
[08:20:27] <Trisox> optgroup?
[08:20:31] <chilversc_> it allows pages to load asynchronously, but expects the scripts to be loaded statically
[08:20:35] <Trisox> thinboy:
[08:20:40] <djQuery> omani_, went through it last night it was pretty good
[08:20:42] <shawn_dones> anyone?
[08:21:01] <thinboy> Trisox: Yes
[08:21:03] <shawn_dones> im in a tight spot
[08:21:13] <Trisox> i did  http://try.jquery.com also
[08:21:22] <Trisox> didnt watch the video's but what the hell
[08:21:24] <Trisox> ;)
[08:21:31] <djQuery> Trisox, lol me neither
[08:21:47] <Trisox> hardest part was reading what they wanned to do ...
[08:21:48] <djQuery> only made a few typos
[08:21:53] <Trisox> yes
[08:22:14] <Trisox> and using stuff they used chapters after the one your in
[08:22:40] <Trisox> using mouseenter mouseleave and i was using hover...
[08:22:46] <Trisox> :p
[08:22:51] * hlve slaps djQuery around a bit with a large trout
[08:22:56] <Trisox> haha !
[08:22:58] <hlve> i like your name
[08:23:06] <thinboy> Trisox: i send you a pm
[08:24:34] <djQuery> thinboy, I think it would best be done with elipses
[08:24:38] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm wondering why I'm getting "Unexpected token 'o'" on my 'data:' line - http://pastebin.com/86V4ZMtN
[08:25:19] <djQuery> li ul li a {over0flow: elipse; } or some such
[08:26:44] <bluesm> "event" variable in event handlers are passed by jQuery
[08:26:52] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, how about $(form).serialize()      instead of JSON.parse
[08:26:56] <bluesm> Or this is just "javascript" event ?
[08:27:24] <djQuery> bluesm, huh
[08:27:43] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, or is that not where u are geting the issue
[08:28:03] <pachet> bluesm: jquery just standardizes standard javascript events
[08:28:14] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: That works, thanks!
[08:28:48] <bluesm> pachet: So this is the jquery "variable" ?
[08:29:15] <jehee> if I have several divs with the same class, can I display them one at a time with a looping timer? Like a flashing newsfeed
[08:29:33] <bluesm> pachet: event.stopPropagation();  should be "multi browser" if it is inside "jquery" event handler ?
[08:29:42] <djQuery> jehee, sure   see ?next
[08:29:43] <bot-t> jehee, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[08:29:58] <Sparticuz> Hey, I've got a jqui dialog, but can sometimes have it's 'close' event be called before it's instantiated. In jqui 1.8, it didn't throw any errors, but in 1.9 and 1.10 it is throwing a "cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization" error. I've been able to bypass the error using a try{ 'close' } catch(err){} and it's seemed to work. is that the best solution?
[08:30:52] <djQuery> Sparticuz, got a reproducable demo?
[08:31:07] <Sparticuz> i've been trying to get it working on jsfiddle
[08:31:11] <djQuery> Sparticuz, check to see if it has been initialized first/
[08:31:26] <thinboy> djQuery: for some reason I need to use <select>
[08:31:28] <jehee> djQuery so what happens when the last div has been displayed?
[08:31:28] <Sparticuz> i tried to use the 'isOpen' on it, but it's throwing an error too
[08:31:38] <jehee> I have to call the function again?
[08:32:36] <djQuery> Sparticuz, if($('selector').data('ui-dialog')){  }
[08:32:37] <Sparticuz> djQuery, http://jsfiddle.net/KJJcR/
[08:32:52] <Sparticuz> ok, i'll try that
[08:33:09] <djQuery> Sparticuz, sorry here $( "#elem" ).is( ":data( 'ui-progressbar' )" );
[08:33:14] <bluesm> pachet: So it does bunch of tricks to make consistent interface in all "internet explorers" ? (Because in IE events are global not passed to function ) Right ?
[08:33:24] <djQuery> Sparticuz, that will return a true false
[08:33:43] <Sparticuz> progressbar or dialog?
[08:34:14] <djQuery> Sparticuz, sorry copied pasted http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/   review this page
[08:34:24] <Sparticuz> ok, i'll take a look, thanks
[08:36:04] <Sparticuz> that worked
[08:36:07] <Sparticuz> thanks!
[08:42:00] <bluesm> Why on tryRuby course they use:
[08:42:03] <bluesm>  $(this).closest('.tour').find('.photos').slideToggle();
[08:42:03] <pachet> bluesm: at the risk of oversimplification, yes
[08:42:41] <bluesm> If they could use  $(this).next().slideToggle();   (this is following sibling)
[08:43:14] <djQuery> bluesm, because they are trying to teach closest?
[08:43:52] <bluesm> djQuery: Maybe. But this seems so ugly.
[08:44:08] <chilversc_> can you have a dialog in jquery mobile that looks and styles like a page?
[08:44:24] <chilversc_> or a page with dialog navigigation behaviour (doesn't appear in history)
[08:44:25] <djQuery> bluesm, and what if the design person changes the layout a little
[08:44:31] <bluesm> djQuery: I think i shouldn't use methods that find something in huge array of nodes if I don't have to. Right ?
[08:44:32] <djQuery> which would still work?
[08:45:06] <djQuery> hey we should wrap that in something to make it prettier
[08:45:59] <djQuery> bluesm, ^^
[08:46:38] <bluesm> djQuery: Their code is more universal, but I think i could lead to fatal performance (especially when lot of elements to check)
[08:46:45] <thinboy> djQuery: i send you a pm
[08:46:47] <bluesm> djQuery: I get it.
[08:46:47] <jehee> $('#' + i).fadeOut().delay(5000); whats up with this? Shouldnt this fadeOut after 5 seconds?
[08:47:03] <djQuery> thinboy, and I closed it without reading it
[08:47:21] <thinboy> djQuery: my apologies.
[08:47:22] <djQuery> jehee, no
[08:47:35] <jehee> what is the purpose of delay then?
[08:47:41] <djQuery> .delay(5000).fadeout()
[08:48:12] <jehee> haha yeah
[08:48:20] <djQuery> jehee, .fadeout has allready returned by the time you called delay
[08:49:12] <bluesm> djQuery: Ok. But where I should draw a line between performance and "universality"
[08:50:04] <omani_> can someone have a look at this please?
[08:50:05] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/234699
[08:50:07] <omani_> what am I missing?
[08:50:14] <omani_> beside the closing </script> tag
[08:50:33] <omani_> my javascript does not work. but if I remove the whole $('input[@name='lom']").change(function(){ thing. it works.
[08:50:47] <omani_> any syntax mistakes?
[08:51:17] <djQuery> bluesm, sorry I don't see how it would be slow.    .closest('.tour')   would be fast     .find('.photos')   would be fast
[08:51:37] <djQuery> true not as fast as just .next   but still
[08:51:52] <xec> omani_: what is the @ good for?
[08:52:05] <omani_> where?
[08:52:07] <omani_> line?
[08:52:14] <omani_> ah at name
[08:52:18] <xec> right
[08:52:24] <omani_> it is an example of an answer in stackoverflow
[08:52:36] <omani_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5142300/javascript-jquery-radio-button-click
[08:52:50] <omani_> oh :/ there says: it's no longer needed. ok :)
[08:52:57] <djQuery> omani_, think the @ is real old
[08:52:59] <bluesm> djQuery: Right. But if you would repeat such pattern over and over. So it could be difference in performance.
[08:53:28] <omani_> ok removed
[08:53:31] <omani_> but still  not working
[08:53:36] <omani_> I have some syntax issues I guess
[08:53:59] <djQuery> omani_, data: {"hallo"}   is bad
[08:54:10] <omani_> djQuery: I took it as an example
[08:54:14] <Trisox> almost time to go home
[08:54:15] <djQuery> data: {"hallo": something}
[08:54:17] <omani_> to see if anything goes through the wire
[08:54:20] <omani_> ok
[08:54:42] <omani_> still not working
[08:54:43] <omani_> :/
[08:54:51] <omani_> I mean. I can't even slidetoggle anymore
[08:54:56] <xec> omani_: i'm not sure what the code is supposed to do, and i can't tell if the selectors are right without the html.
[08:55:00] <omani_> so the whole javascript is wrong I guess
[08:55:01] <djQuery> omani_, see ?ftjq

[08:55:02] <Trisox> djQuery: data: in a ajax call ;)
[08:55:53] <djQuery> omani_, most likely if you open the console it will be screaming at u what the error is
[08:56:08] <Trisox> big red letters!
[08:56:21] <omani_> djQuery: which console?
[08:56:31] <omani_> I use firbug
[08:56:33] <xec> the javascript console. check the link from bot-t
[08:56:33] <omani_> firebug
[08:56:35] <Trisox> firebug, chrome dev tools
[08:56:37] <Trisox> what ever
[08:56:45] <omani_> I don't have any errors in firebug
[08:57:16] <omani_> will it show errors even if javascript does not load
[08:57:20] <omani_> because of syntax errors?
[08:57:25] <Trisox> :p
[08:58:27] <omani_> ok now I get erros
[08:58:30] <omani_> I had to reload the page =)
[08:58:59] <omani_> SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list -> $('input[name='lom']").change(function(){
[08:59:04] <omani_>                                                                    ^

[08:59:18] <djQuery> omani_, does your editor not have a code checker
[08:59:18] <Trisox> ?
[08:59:19] <omani_> man the "l" of "lom"
[08:59:24] <omani_> djQuery: no
[08:59:32] <Trisox> ?sublimetext2
[08:59:33] <omani_> I use vim and have no javascript plugin so far
[08:59:33] <djQuery> get a different editor

[09:03:09] <djQuery> zfly9, most likely jquery.cycle.lite-1.5
[09:03:18] <Trisox> same costs
[09:03:24] <zfly9> djQuery seems like it was used on something else

[09:07:26] <Trisox> oh lol np
[09:07:54] <Trisox> yolo so good to help
[09:08:12] <jehee> why does this show all newsItems at the same time? http://jsfiddle.net/4CPc2/
[09:09:23] <djQuery> jehee, would help with some html
[09:09:52] <Trisox> no scoping ;)
[09:09:52] <djQuery> jehee, do they all hav the same id?
[09:10:10] <Trisox> class ;)
[09:10:18] <jehee> djQuery no
[09:10:34] <jehee> newsItems is the id of all divs
[09:10:38] <cdwSymfony> Greetigns... got a question.. I am loading some dom elements through hinclude.js, any now how to bind jquery plugins when the elements are done?
[09:10:40] <Trisox> ah ok
[09:10:44] <Trisox> i see now
[09:10:46] <jehee> the div is a counter
[09:10:54] <jehee> and newsItems is a decreasing counter.
[09:11:05] <chilversc_> jehee: you call tickNews immediatly rather than as a callback to setTimeout
[09:11:18] <Trisox> try             $('#' + newsItems).fadeIn().delay(5000).fadeOut();
[09:12:52] <jehee> chilversc_I thought setTimeout was to hold the function call for 5000 ms
[09:13:02] <djQuery> jehee, chilversc yeah see it now   setTimeout(function(){teckNews(newsItems);}, 5000);
[09:13:39] <chilversc_> jehee: it will, but you have to pass it a callback, you're calling the function immediatly
[09:14:06] <chilversc_> jehee: it then tries to use the return value of said function as a callback, which probably errors as I don't think setTimeout is expecting undefined
[09:14:55] <chilversc_> oh it will, hell knows why
[09:15:06] <Trisox> i'm off to home guys and girls have a nice day!
[09:16:14] <w0rldmaker> i have a page that loads new content via ajax. in this content there are script tags which seem to disappear. is there a workaround for this?
[09:16:32] <w0rldmaker> i tried using document.createElement to make a new script but that disappears as well
[09:16:57] <pachet> w0rldmaker: jquery strips <script> tags out of html content before inserting it into the dom
[09:18:25] <w0rldmaker> pachet: and there is no suggested way around that?
[09:18:36] <pachet> i mean
[09:18:38] <pachet> what is your use case
[09:18:46] <djQuery> ?getscript
[09:18:46] <pachet> the script is evaluated
[09:18:46] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[09:19:10] <pachet> they just remove the tag so that it wont be evaluated more than once if you're doing a lot of mucking around with that http content
[09:22:41] <Draeli> A little question about DOM detection. I want to detect when new DOM element is add/delete from DOM page. An idea to detect this ? (i don't want mutation observer but really detect if something is add by jQuery in the document DOM)
[09:22:46] <Cryp71c> In IE 8 I'm getting "Object doesn't support the property or method" when I call window.open (which I've overloaded in this code: http://paste2.org/p/3129526)
[09:23:51] <w0rldmaker> pachet: sorry, the use case is google conversion tracking. so i have to make some variables accessible on the page
[09:24:02] <w0rldmaker> pachet: and it's not apparently picking them up
[09:24:06] <djQuery> ?newcontent@draeli
[09:24:07] <bot-t> draeli, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[09:26:14] <Draeli> djQuery: thank you, I look
[09:27:24] <chilversc_> Draeli: though jquery shouldn't add stuff without you telling it
[09:27:54] <chilversc_> Draeli: so I prefer to go the other way, and have say an event bus, so I can raise an event saying something happened, then modify the dom with jquery
[09:28:10] <djQuery> Draeli, you could always duck punch .append
[09:28:35] <Cryp71c> In addition to my original question, I did some research and I guess the problem is how i've gotten my overload written (http://paste2.org/p/3129526)...IE doesn't seem to think that "open" is a function, and thus...calling .call on it throws an error. But I'm not sure what changes to make so that IE recognizes it as a method (Firefox, Chrome, etc. all work fine...they recognize that open is a method).
[09:28:36] <chilversc_> which I guess is similar to what .newContent() does, only the event bus doesn't depend upon jquery
[09:29:55] <Tomashe> hey guys i think i found some bug OR i do something wrong which is more likely :)... when i run this $(".placeholder").eq(holder).find("img").attr("src"); quick sometimes the result is undefined , while when im running $(".placeholder").find("img").attr("src"); it always show a value... i guess the eq() have some issues of speed ? or any other suggestions
[09:30:46] <chilversc_> djQuery: hmm, I bet newContent can be replaced by custom events, event bubbling and live events
[09:31:46] <djQuery> chilversc_, what I used it in the for in the past was to apply ui to the items that were added
[09:31:59] <chilversc_> Tomashe: no, .eq means it only pulls that specific index, what's the value of holder?
[09:32:14] <Draeli> chilversc_: I agree in the idea but you understand exactly what I want. In my case, I can't manage element add by other plugin and in this case, I want only to have a listener for new element and in my plugin with this know what to do
[09:32:27] <Tomashe> i checked the holder always set to the right value
[09:32:43] <chilversc_> djQuery: yeah, my thought was it doesn't need to be coupled to jquery, that's all, an event bus is generally useful, so you just raise a message along with the newly added dom elements
[09:32:44] <Tomashe> the value is change durring some actions i do live
[09:32:55] <chilversc_> djQuery: or you can just use a custom event
[09:32:59] <Tomashe> and on every action i alert the holder value and seems it was always correct
[09:33:19] <chilversc_> Tomashe: right, but if your selector only finds 1 item, and holder > 0, eq will find nothing
[09:33:30] <Tomashe> the problem on that $(".placeholder").eq(holder).find("img").attr("src"); , although the holder was correct if i preform the action to quick, this alert me undefined
[09:33:41] <Tomashe> no there are more then 100
[09:34:05] <djQuery> Tomashe, but if holder=100 then it will find nothing
[09:34:23] <djQuery> eq(is a 0 based array
[09:34:29] <chilversc_> too quick makes no sense, javascript is single threaded and synchronous, unless you use ajax, or a timeout
[09:34:32] <omani_> ok now I need to slideUP the current <ul> and slidedown the next one on change
[09:34:33] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/234707
[09:34:41] <omani_> I think it's easy. but just can't figure it out
[09:34:56] <omani_> it must be something with double next. but does not work
[09:35:20] <Tomashe> why
[09:35:27] <Tomashe> ohh i decrease it by 1
[09:35:37] <Tomashe> cuz eq start with 0
[09:35:56] <Tomashe> the HOLDER is correct value each time , it was checked and confiemed
[09:36:16] <chilversc_> Tomashe: somewhere you must be either failing to set that before calling the function, or setting it to undefined then
[09:36:46] <chilversc_> Tomashe: so even if its correct where you checked, between where you checked and that function being called, something must be changing it
[09:37:05] <Tomashe> let me show u i will pastebin
[09:37:24] <davetarmac> Still having some bother with this MetroJS stuff - I need to add a delay after each animation finishes to get my cascade working correctly. My fiddle has gone only so far... http://jsfiddle.net/sHbPS/2/
[09:37:53] <djQuery> omani_, it would realy help if you would put the ul in the p
[09:37:55] <omani_> I made a quick jsfiddle
[09:37:56] <omani_> http://jsfiddle.net/6ENBM/4/
[09:38:11] <omani_> djQuery: why?
[09:38:51] <Tomashe> http://pastebin.com/NiB4vS56
[09:39:38] <chilversc_> Tomashe: I thought it might be something like that, eq doesn't work the way you're thinking it does
[09:40:09] <chilversc_> ah wait no, I mis read that line, ok, what is line 2 actually doing to that style element?
[09:40:12] <omani_> djQuery: see the jsfiddle pastebin?
[09:40:22] <Tomashe> actually i think i found the issue
[09:40:25] <omani_> how can I slideDown the next foo? on change of radio button click
[09:40:40] <Tomashe> i use the other plugin to put the image into the placeholder
[09:41:04] <Tomashe> seems like when i click to fast it yet to put the image inside the placeholder so when i check for the img_src there is no image inside
[09:41:09] <omani_> and I think $('p.q>a').closest('p.q').next('ul.fragen').slideUp(); does slideUp everything actually.
[09:41:42] <Tomashe> so actually my .eq( workes fin
[09:41:43] <Tomashe> e
[09:45:10] <Draeli> djQuery: I was thinking to overload all jquery who allow to add element (like html/append/...) for add custom event like .on('add', ...) but after lot of try I miss to do this correctly. May be you know a plugin who already do this ?
[09:46:29] <hlve> http://pastebin.com/Ax4gKm7h why isn't my .hide working on else?
[09:46:56] <hlve> do I need to make it an on click function, or can I keep that as change and it work?
[09:47:21] <NoiseEee> well what's $("[name$=SurveyReason]") ?  what kind of element?
[09:47:30] <hlve> radio
[09:47:35] <omani_> djQuery:
[09:47:38] <omani_> http://jsfiddle.net/6ENBM/6/
[09:47:53] <NoiseEee> hlve: personally i use click for that
[09:47:58] <hlve> kk.
[09:48:00] <hlve> Let me try that real quick :)
[09:48:15] <omani_> http://jsfiddle.net/6ENBM/7/
[09:48:21] <hlve> click doesn't fire off the else .hide though
[09:48:35] <hlve> .show works fine. but when I click on another radio, it doesn't fire off the else
[09:48:37] <NoiseEee> hlve: try debugging and making sure you're getting what you think you're getting, etc?
[09:49:16] <hlve> ah that's not working.
[09:49:16] <hlve> Hm
[09:49:27] <thinboy> Hi I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/PjVnV/2/ how can I add a if statement to add "--" if its a submenu (ul ul li a).
[09:50:23] <hlve> sec. NoiseEee, can I paste you my code to look over? It's in ASP, so JSFiddle won't really help but maybe you can see what I'm trying to do better.
[09:50:27] <hlve> pastebin*
[09:51:57] <NoiseEee> hlve: why not try debugging and discover whats wrong. throw in 'debugger;' into the function and peek around.

[10:24:24] <SineSwiper> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13593 - Any idea why this wouldn't be considered a normalization bug?
[10:26:11] <xenaxon> help. Why doesn't draggable work on mobile?
[10:26:32] <xenaxon> I've made a slider with draggable, specifically to be mobile-friendly
[10:26:34] <Eviltwin> SineSwiper: jQuery doesn't promise to make unsupported behavior identical across different browsers
[10:26:43] <Eviltwin> SineSwiper: This is considered unsupported behavior
[10:27:10] <xenaxon> I've made a touch slider, and funny thing... it's not working on mobile.
[10:27:20] <xenaxon> I can't use the finger to drag
[10:27:33] <SineSwiper> Eviltwin: unsupported?  is "display: none" for an option illegal under CSS or JS?
[10:27:40] <xenaxon> does jquery draggable work on mobile?
[10:27:42] <djQuery> xenaxon, did you search at all ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4488601/jquery-draggable-images-on-ipad-iphone-how-to-integrate-event-preventdefau/4488662#4488662
[10:28:34] <velts> does anyone know any tools that given a URL can crawl every page that is linked to from that URL
[10:28:39] <Eviltwin> xenaxon: Have you looked at this? http://touchpunch.furf.com
[10:28:57] <slash_nick> jaagr: http://silviomoreto.github.com/bootstrap-select/
[10:29:02] <xenaxon> hi.
[10:29:22] <Eviltwin> SineSwiper: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2324259
[10:29:24] <xenaxon> no, I haven't searched much
[10:29:42] <xenaxon> but I tought that jquery draggable works on mobile, so that's why I didn't
[10:30:17] <jaagr> slash_nick: that sure is a more complete integration :)
[10:31:19] <slash_nick> jaagr: thank you again for your time...
[10:31:29] <jaagr> slash_nick: how did it go?
[10:31:38] <SineSwiper> Eviltwin: oh, I know the workaround, but it's a bit more painful... I'm trying to figure out why it's not supported in IE; is it standards or is it IE?
[10:32:01] <slash_nick> So far so good... a few more little items to polish. we go live tomorrow.
[10:32:16] <grafi> jaagr was the less specific query an answer to my question?
[10:32:25] <Eviltwin> SineSwiper: IE said "fuck standards, we know better"
[10:32:50] <SineSwiper> Eviltwin: yes, I know, and jQuery said "fuck IE, we'll put the standards back in"
[10:32:53] <Eviltwin> Additionally, since it's not drawn like a normal element, I'm not sure it's part of the standards anyway
[10:32:59] <Eviltwin> No, no it did not
[10:33:06] <jaagr> grafi: a short version of an answer yes
[10:33:08] <Eviltwin> jQuery never promised to make everything work identically on all browsers
[10:33:12] <Eviltwin> People seem to think it did
[10:33:14] <Eviltwin> It did not
[10:33:15] <jaagr> slash_nick: ok cool.. good luck
[10:33:18] <SineSwiper> part of jQuery's goals are normalization
[10:33:37] <grafi> jaagr any pointers to a long version? :P
[10:33:49] <djQuery> grafi, becuase ur saying go look at each form then go through its children then figure out of the children are inputs
[10:34:21] <Eviltwin> SineSwiper: Please show me where jQuery says that
[10:34:31] <djQuery> grafi, its a lot simpler for :input to just grab all input select and textarea that maps to native a lot easier
[10:35:11] <grafi> so :input doesnt have to over each element looking if its an input?
[10:35:37] <djQuery> grafi, depending on the browser no
[10:35:52] <SineSwiper> Eviltwin: well, it looks things have changed with the recent "fine print" on the site; it says "cross-browser", but then you have a disclaimer on CSS elements
[10:35:59] <grafi> hm
[10:36:05] <grafi> okidoke
[10:36:10] <grafi> thanks djQuery
[10:36:42] <djQuery> grafi, if you want to make it faster  $(':input', someformelement)   will restrict it to just looking in that form
[10:37:09] <grafi> i see
[10:37:14] <grafi> will try that
[10:37:16] <grafi> :P
[10:37:16] <Eviltwin> SineSwiper: Cross-browser does not mean every piece of unsupported behavior in one browser magically becomes supported in all of them
[10:37:42] <SineSwiper> Eviltwin: well, tell me where it says that it's "unsupported"
[10:38:03] <Eviltwin> Tell me where in the W3C spec this behavior is defined
[10:38:07] <SineSwiper> when I call a hide(), I'd expect it to work across all browsers
[10:38:25] <Eviltwin> When you call a hide, jQuery promises to attempt to set display: none
[10:38:33] <Eviltwin> Please see our documentation: http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[10:38:49] <xenaxon> I've made the slider work on mobile
[10:38:53] <xenaxon> but still it's kind of slow
[10:39:04] <xenaxon> I was expecting it to work faster
[10:39:23] <SineSwiper> Eviltwin: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#display-prop
[10:39:40] <Eviltwin> ...
[10:39:55] <Eviltwin> So where does it say it works for <option> tags?
[10:40:21] <SineSwiper> Applies to:Â Â all elements, and there is no exceptions made for <option> tags
[10:40:30] <Sonderblade> how would you in jquery match all td's which directly contains an a with class="foo"?
[10:41:01] <Eviltwin> SineSwiper: Well guess what, jQuery sets display: none
[10:41:17] <Eviltwin> But <select> menus aren't rendered like normal elements
[10:41:25] <Eviltwin> So there is no promise the element won't be displayed
[10:46:01] <SineSwiper> well, we'll just have to agree to disagree; concessions have been made to make jQuery work in IE6, but on the same note, I can understand the slippery slope argument of supporting too much cross-browser capability for the later browsers
[10:52:55] <ydna101> Hi, I'm try to modify the 'CHANGETHIS' text in the following snippet: <tr><td>CHANGETHIS<br><input type="text"...
[10:54:10] <ydna101> is that possible to do with jquery? i've tried a variety of selectors, but no luck so far
[10:54:10] <mg983> snippet.replace("CHANGETHIS", "whatever you want");
[10:55:11] <mg983> don't need jquery buddy
[10:56:03] <ydna101> hmm, how do i select it to begin with though?

[11:20:25] <bzitzow> JQuery UI Accordion. I've got a <div> in the accordian header that when clicked reveals another div (that was previously hidden). This all works great except the div being revealed is UNDERNEATH the Accordion contents, and I need it to appear above it (it's a menu).
[11:20:51] <zfly9> Where on this plugin https://raw.github.com/malsup/cycle/master/jquery.cycle.lite.js can I add $(this).addClass('current-slide') to give the current slide a class
[11:20:59] <zfly9> can't find it for the life of me
[11:21:19] <bzitzow> I've tried z-index. The div is position: absolute ... I've tried position: relative for the accordion div's and accordion content div.

[11:31:52] <Stilo> http://jsfiddle.net/9r3Qd/1/
[11:31:56] <Stilo> what's going wrong there
[11:33:53] <FelipeFDL> Stilo: where #ip?
[11:39:14] <jrahern> I currently have a click function for specific a tag - $("#full-squares a").click(function () {}, is there any way to add an OR statement or something so that if its $("#full-squares a").click or $("#another a").click?
[11:41:29] <pachet> jrahern: you just want to bind that handler to the results matching both selectors?
[11:41:41] <jrahern> pachet: correct
[11:41:54] <pachet> $('#full-squares a, #another a').on('click', fn)
[11:42:05] <NoiseEee> Stilo: buttons don't submit, forms do.
[11:42:10] <jrahern> pachet: much appreciated.
[11:42:37] <say2joe> in soviet russia, form submits button
[11:47:20] <Stilo> NoiseEee can you edit my jsfiddle pls?
[11:49:47] <NoiseEee> Stilo: you don't even have a <form> in there!  or anything with an ID of ip1
[11:49:49] <NoiseEee> Stilo: you don't even have a <form> in there!  or anything with an ID of ip!
[11:50:15] <pachet> NoiseEee maybe he wants you to make the form
[11:50:39] <NoiseEee> Stilo: watch for the submit event on the <form> and not a submit button.
[11:51:52] <jaagr> funny stuff :)
[11:52:23] <clone1018> Hey there, I have a div behind another div and I want to get the x,y of the cropped off space (the space you can't see)
[11:53:58] <clone1018> god see I'm doing it wrong
[11:54:06] <clone1018> But I can't figure out how I should do it
[11:57:01] <say2joe> clone: can't you get the x,y of each and the width/height (area) and just subtract?
[11:57:38] <say2joe> well, not quite that easyâ€¦ but i that's the general direction you want.
[11:58:08] <jtal> is "this" available in selector callbacks?
[11:58:40] <jtal> $("stuff").change(someFunction(this,otherStuff));
[11:59:26] <pachet> clone1018: here's a hint:
[11:59:33] <pachet> the area of intersection is going to be a rectangle
[12:00:15] <pachet> the top left corner of that rectangle is the maximum x point of both rectangle's left offset vs the max y of their top offset
[12:00:35] <pachet> something like Math.max(rec1.offset().top, rec2.offset().top)
[12:00:48] <rabx> I am using 'after' to insert some styles after my h2 tag. Everything works just fine until I visited my pricing table which happens to use h2s. So I wrote this trying to remove the styles but it's not working properly: http://jsfiddle.net/gQPgR/1/
[12:00:49] <pachet> obviously you'd be reusing the result of .offset() so you'd want to store it in a variable
[12:01:04] <pachet> clone1018: then just do the opposite for the bottom right corner
[12:01:17] <pachet> and that gives you the x,y of the intersection's top left corner, and its width and height
[12:02:10] <pmercado> is possible to overwrite a method, and inside that function call function that is ovewritten?
[12:02:32] <pmercado> uhm, I read myself, seems impossible
[12:02:34] <pachet> pmercado: sure, just store a reference to the original before you reassign it
[12:02:52] <pmercado> uhm
[12:03:35] <rabx> like function overloading?
[12:03:41] <pachet> var original_hide = $.fn.hide; $.fn.hide = function myhide(){ /* do stuff */ return original_hide.apply(this, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)); }
[12:03:51] <pmercado> I'm using a library (validationEngine in a very old version)  that doesn't close error promts and place them in wrong location
[12:04:02] <pmercado> rabx: yes
[12:04:25] <pmercado> exist this method: $.validationEngine.submitValidation() that return true or false
[12:04:29] <rabx> pmercado  http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-method-overloading/
[12:04:42] <rabx> might be helpful
[12:04:49] <pmercado> so before run submitValidation(), run the closePromps() function
[12:05:16] <pmercado> and then run submitValidation as needed
[12:05:18] <pmercado> ok
[12:05:21] <pachet> pmercado: the problem is if anything calls that method internal to validationEngine
[12:05:32] <pachet> it may not point to the method as a property of the forward facing obj
[12:06:03] <pachet> that's just a general issue to be aware of, i have no idea whether validationEngine does that
[12:06:33] <pmercado> uhm
[12:09:10] <zfly9> Where on this plugin https://raw.github.com/malsup/cycle/master/jquery.cycle.lite.js can I add $(this).addClass('current-slide') to give the current slide a class
[12:09:13] <zfly9> can't find it for the life of me
[12:10:41] <eph3meral> where can I find the documentation for the syntax of creating elements that looks like $("<div>", { style: "foo", class: "bar" })
[12:10:49] <GoSox> I know <tr>'s have limited styling options. can you bind click events to them?
[12:11:44] <rabx> eph3meral I believe you want jquery.map
[12:11:50] <rabx> It's for mapping arrays
[12:12:52] <shoky> ?jQuery @ eph3meral
[12:12:53] <bot-t> eph3meral, jquery: A string containing the jQuery version number. http://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[12:13:13] <eph3meral> shoky: I should be on 1.9 if that's what you're asking
[12:13:22] <eph3meral> and I know where the docs are, I just don't know what to look up
[12:13:23] <shoky> eph3meral: i'm not asking, i gave you the link
[12:13:41] <eph3meral> oh, yes
[12:13:44] <eph3meral> right you did :)
[12:18:26] <StephenS> one question
[12:18:46] <StephenS> how some sites call ajax when its needed? Like I send msg and they call request when I sent msg? Is connection open all the time?
[12:19:24] <StephenS> or is that comet?
[12:20:06] <eph3meral> StephenS: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:20:21] <StephenS> I dont think its ajax as I dont make request all the time
[12:20:32] <StephenS> I see xhr is called only when I send msg
[12:21:12] <StephenS> ya I think its comet as connection does not end
[12:22:59] <sonotos> comet are longpoling requests that end if the server send data or when they run in a timeout, the a new longpolling connect is opened. nonclosing connections sound like websockets
[12:24:18] <StephenS> yes sonotos this is what that web do as I can see on both side
[12:24:26] <StephenS> connection is opened a very long time and ends up when I send msg so its comet
[12:24:38] <sonotos> correct
[12:24:40] <StephenS> Its not for sure websocket as node.js or such
[12:25:13] <StephenS> But too many open comet connections can bring my server down?
[12:25:24] <StephenS> but its better than usuall ajax call every 10 seconds..
[12:25:42] <sonotos> StephenS: why should they? they are just waiting
[12:26:00] <sonotos> as long as you're not running out of ports...
[12:26:19] <StephenS> What if I have 100k members chatting on both sides?
[12:26:25] <StephenS> there is no 100k ports..?
[12:26:37] <sonotos> StephenS: you would have more than one server for that
[12:27:04] <StephenS> ok and is comet supported by all browserS?
[12:27:10] <StephenS> unlike websockets which are not.
[12:27:34] <sonotos> well that's the case
[12:27:37] <hlve> i'll steal all your ports
[12:28:30] <sonotos> hm sounds greedy
[12:28:35] <jtal> can someone take a look at this line of code? http://pastie.org/6464091
[12:28:47] <pachet> StephenS: theoretically yes, its supported cross-browser
[12:28:51] <pachet> that's the principal appeal
[12:28:57] <pachet> but you lose out on performance bigtime vs sockets
[12:29:09] <StephenS> ya I know
[12:29:24] <NoiseEee> StephenS: thats why people implement socket.io these days
[12:29:25] <sonotos> StephenS: use it as fallback for shitty browsers
[12:29:30] <StephenS> but I already familiar with comet and might switch to websockets in future
[12:29:36] <supsup> does anyone know a fairly accurate way to check if the device viewing the page is a browser, a mobile phone, or a tablet?
[12:29:39] <NoiseEee> StephenS: just use socket.io and forget about it.
[12:29:49] <pachet> what NoiseEee said
[12:29:56] <pachet> more hours in the day for liquor consumption
[12:29:57] <pachet> thanks socket.io
[12:30:08] <sonotos> nice
[12:30:23] <StephenS> and why dont I use python as websocket?
[12:30:32] <StephenS> python is very fast and even Google use it
[12:30:39] <jtal> why not write this thing in erlang?
[12:31:10] <sonotos> StephenS: just do it
[12:31:25] <StephenS> also how would I do fallback with socket.io
[12:31:51] <NoiseEee> StephenS: socket.io takes care of all the fallbacks.  provides websockets to capable browsers, long-polling/flash etc to those incapable
[12:32:28] <sonotos> hm need to check if i can use that to connect to a xmmp server
[12:32:31] <jtal> something in jquery is mangling a variable of mine between ready() and change()
[12:32:32] <sonotos> that's nice
[12:32:42] <jtal> I am not modifying it anywhere except intially (where it is working correctly)
[12:32:57] <jtal> but by the time change() happens the variable has been modified
[12:33:07] <WeakTea> can .click() be used to trigger other .triggers()? is there a better way to truly simulate clicking on an element?
[12:33:08] <naeluh> this is the best tues day ever
[12:34:38] <jtal> anyone experience anything like this before?
[12:34:53] <chinoto> WeakTea: I had to do some really goofy stuff to get a webpage to recognize my psuedo clicking.
[12:35:06] <chinoto> from a firefox plugin
[12:35:11] <WeakTea> chinoto, do share?
[12:35:24] <limpc> how do you update a html5 progress element via jquery in chrome?

[12:54:15] <rabx> yup
[12:54:16] <jedimind> why would use use js for that ?
[12:54:20] <jedimind> js is behaviour
[12:54:21] <ladislaw> I have 2 divs*
[12:54:24] <jedimind> css is presentation

[12:55:18] <NoiseEee> ladislaw: jsfiddle an example
[12:55:26] <jedimind> rabx this whole thing can be done without javascript
[12:55:33] <jedimind> you don't need to be adding things to the dom with javascript
[12:55:37] <jedimind> just to create those underlines

[12:57:10] <pachet> defaultr0: you cant have variables inside objects
[12:57:27] <pachet> you can have variables inside closures?
[12:57:43] <ajpiano> defaultr0: you mean "hash" is a variable that contains the name of the key you actually want to look up ?
[12:57:44] <rabx> jedimind I understand. But getting back on topic, whats the best jquery method for removing the second line inside of the div#shared ?
[12:57:45] <pachet> well, technically the env record is an object, but you know what i mean
[12:57:47] <NoiseEee> esponse.objA.objB[hash]
[12:57:51] <ajpiano> ^^
[12:58:17] <zfly9> ... anyone?
[12:58:24] <jedimind> "whats the best method of using this airplane to drive to the corner store?"
[12:58:38] <pachet> jedimind: autopilot
[12:58:48] <pachet> release countermeasures
[12:59:05] <jedimind> extra peanuts for passengers
[12:59:07] <jehee> pachet: the autopilot wont crash into the ground, it will avoid collission or disengage it.
[12:59:31] <pachet> disengage the ground
[12:59:43] <pachet> i guess that's what airplanes do
[12:59:46] <jehee> I knew you were gonna say that, disengage the AP ofc.
[13:00:05] <pachet> lol
[13:00:35] <rabx> jedimind I know I can do this without using jquery. It would be very simple and very time consuming to go back and fix a lot of things in this theme. So I am hoping to get a straight answer about removing that line from the second div
[13:01:05] <jedimind> thats cool, i wish you all the best in that
[13:02:14] <jehee> rabx just look through each line and use a counter and when you reach line two remove it.
[13:02:24] <defaultr0> sorry, I'm back
[13:02:25] <jaagr> love how when every time I decide to work on my own projects after work I put irssi up on one of my monitors and keep focusing on the questions in here because of curiousty... doubt there's a better way to decrease productivity ;)
[13:02:49] <pachet> jaagr: irssi + alcohol
[13:03:24] <chinoto> jaagr: I'm doing the same thing... except I'm at work >.>
[13:03:45] <chinoto> I did come here to ask a question though, just haven't gotten around to it yet >.>
[13:03:54] <jehee> rabx: seriously I have no idea, just disregard what I said.
[13:04:34] <jaagr> pachet: hehe yeah
[13:05:04] <jaagr> chinoto: yeah it's dangerous hehe
[13:05:25] <defaultr0> ajpiano: this is how it looks like,  [Object { id="newest",  region="all"}, Object { hash="90e3",  id="110",  newest="true"}]
[13:05:34] * jaagr knows alot about using "yeah" and "hehe" in his replies
[13:05:49] <ajpiano> defaultr0, so you have an array
[13:05:52] <ajpiano> not nested objects
[13:05:53] <defaultr0> yes
[13:06:04] <ajpiano> so you have to acesss it using the index
[13:06:08] <defaultr0> [1]
[13:06:10] <hlve> ajpiano!
[13:06:14] <defaultr0> i got that part
[13:06:15] <ajpiano> yup
[13:06:27] <hlve> one of my favorite jquery wizards.
[13:06:39] <defaultr0> but that object is inside another object that is also inside another object
[13:06:52] <defaultr0> i did a console.log(response);
[13:07:45] <defaultr0> when I click response, I see response, the objA, then ObjA1 then the two values i posted above
[13:08:19] <defaultr0> I tried response.objA.ObjA1[1].hash but didn't work
[13:08:20] <ajpiano> response.objA[1].hash ?
[13:08:44] <defaultr0> I'll try it
[13:08:48] <ajpiano> defaultr0: you either need to show a live version of the data structure or figure it out yourself
[13:09:03] <ajpiano> otherwise it's like giving someone directions by saying "turn right, turn left, make 3 lefts, turn right" without ever saying a street name
[13:09:31] <ajpiano> well it's more like, saying "i'm lost, i made a few lefts and a right, where am i"
[13:09:32] <chinoto> I believe I'm being silly and non-standard... isn't the normal way of attaching an event via attribute to make the function in global scope and then say "on*='myfunc()'" on the element?
[13:09:34] <defaultr0> i'm having a hard time copying it
[13:09:49] <defaultr0> i'll do my best
[13:10:15] <jaagr> chinoto: I'd avoid the global scope as much as possible if I were you
[13:10:33] <chinoto> hmm, I think I have another idea then...
[13:11:07] <jaagr> If it's not necessary to expose it - don't. Simply put.
[13:11:32] <pachet> chinoto: attaching an event handler by setting the attribute is definitely non-standard
[13:11:42] <pachet> non-performant, non-scalable
[13:11:46] <pachet> whole lotta nons
[13:11:48] <chinoto> oh, woops
[13:12:16] <chinoto> then it's probably just a very common mistake, not standard :D
[13:12:52] <chinoto> though, I need to figure out how to do this in some way :/
[13:13:00] <chinoto> will ask in a bit
[13:13:08] <jaagr> guess I read ur statement wrong. even though my answer will remain the same :)
[13:13:39] <jaagr> s/statement/questiojn
[13:13:41] <jaagr> -j
[13:14:30] <chinoto> shouldn't there be an ending slash for a sed replace?
[13:14:52] <chinoto> although, I guess other languages use the same syntax
[13:16:17] <StephenS> if DB
[13:16:28] <defaultr0> I got it working ajpiano. I had to specify the response twice. console.log(response.response.objA.objA1[1].hash); That's weird
[13:16:34] <StephenS> If value in DB change and that is trigger, how can I make a new div..?
[13:16:37] <ajpiano> oh
[13:16:43] <defaultr0> why is it like that?
[13:16:53] <ajpiano> how should i know
[13:17:04] <defaultr0> :) i'll check the jsonstring
[13:17:29] <defaultr0> damn, they also used response in their reply to my request. LOL
[13:17:46] <defaultr0> I will change my success and use a different variable
[13:18:11] <CJKay_> Is there any way to identify when a container has been resized when it is using a percentage width?
[13:20:02] <chilversc> CJKay: heh, there's an SO post with almost that exact same question, and its pretty much what I thought, you can't directly
[13:20:15] <CJKay> Dangit
[13:20:25] <chilversc> CJKay: but you can hook the window resize event, then you just have to store in a variable what the last size was, and compare the current size with the old size
[13:20:50] <ajpiano> CJKay: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[13:20:52] <CJKay> Yeah, but I was jus thinking in cases where the container is resized by Javascript or the likes
[13:20:56] <chinoto> you can't hook resize to an element?
[13:20:58] <chilversc> CJKay: if the work is quite heavy, you might want to throttle/debounce that event a bit
[13:21:16] <CJKay> I'll see what I can do. Thanks
[13:21:17] <chilversc> CJKay: oh, if you control the javascript, raise a custom event before resizing it?
[13:21:37] <ajpiano> chinoto: nope
[13:21:43] <CJKay> Well what I'm doing is building a calc() polyfill, so I don't have control over that
[13:21:57] <chilversc> CJKay: hmm, or before mutating the dom, since that could resize it
[13:21:58] <CJKay> I guess that's just going to have to be a limitation
[13:22:14] <chilversc> CJKay: yeah, probably
[13:22:23] <CJKay> Shame
[13:22:23] <chilversc> what's the calc method do?
[13:22:25] <chinoto> well that's lame, I've thought about using it a few times, don't remember for what...
[13:22:42] <CJKay> chilversc: calc() allows you to mix units
[13:22:50] <CJKay> e.g. 100% - 100px
[13:22:54] <chilversc> oh, calc css
[13:22:58] <CJKay> Yeah, sorry heh
[13:24:07] <chilversc> CJKay: seems it isn't that feasable, html5please.com doesn't list any real alternative
[13:24:25] <CJKay> Its feasibility is debateable
[13:24:46] <chilversc> CJKay: and not seeing much on the web, or stack overflow about a polyfil for that one either
[13:24:57] <CJKay> Considering most browser remove any unknown properties from their CSS engines, it does make things difficult, but I've gotten around that one
[13:25:14] <CJKay> It does mean parsing the CSS manually
[13:25:24] <chilversc> I'd say you shouldn't try and polyfill that one, and just handle the fallback in the CSS stylesheet
[13:25:33] <chilversc> or use feature detection and load a fallback stylesheet
[13:25:34] <CJKay> Well, it's not massively inefficient to be honest
[13:26:35] <CJKay> In fact jQuery is orders of magnitute slower to boot up
[13:26:57] <CJKay> 4ms spent parsing a basic 30 line stylesheet and identifying which elements need the polyfill
[13:27:16] <CJKay> (In IE9 with IE7 engine)
[13:27:33] <NoiseEee> 4 entire ms
[13:27:41] <NoiseEee> man the things i could do with an extra 3ms
[13:28:00] <CJKay> One of the functions in jQuery takes an odd 56ms, and there are a lot more from jQuery here heh
[13:30:27] <chilversc> CJKay: I was more thinking because you don't get the resize support, so that can make things weird
[13:30:50] <chilversc> though you can still get window resize
[13:31:13] <CJKay> Window resize is likely to be fine considering calc is mostly used for figuring out headers and footers
[13:31:30] <CJKay> Dynamically resized parents are a minority case, just a potentially useful one
[13:31:58] <CJKay> Saying that, IE doesn't seem to support $(window).resize()
[13:32:02] <CJKay> Gee
[13:33:05] <chilversc> CJKay: its polyfills all the way down
[13:33:14] <CJKay> Hehe
[13:33:34] <CJKay> I consider calc one of the more useful polyfills considering how much pain CSS2 has put people through
[13:34:28] <chilversc> I just think css should add a simple; body { please-just-center-the-damn-content: it-really-shouldnt-be-that-hard }
[13:34:51] <anyvie> hum
[13:34:59] <CJKay> margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
[13:35:09] <anyvie> #content { width:1000px; margin: 0 auto; }
[13:35:13] <CJKay> Vertical centre is less easy
[13:35:45] <chilversc> CJKay: yeah, that's what I was thinking about, these fixed headers/footers, center all so common you thought someone would have realised they should be supported by now
[13:36:18] <CJKay> Crappy Stylesheet Solutions (TM)
[13:38:41] <CJKay> Anyone else got any problems with $(window).resize() or $(window).bind("resize") not firing in IE?
[13:40:05] <chinoto> for vertical centering, you could either use a table cell or make a width:0;height:100% div and make it's container be vertical-align:center (or was it middle?)
[13:40:20] <anyvie> middle, yes :)
[13:47:46] <chinoto> GAH, I made a jsbin of my problem/solution to get advice, but appears that jsbin is evil -_-
[13:47:57] <tds5016> hey. can someone help me figure out why touchpunch places the helpers when I first drag to the top right of the element, and how I might fix that?
[13:48:59] <chinoto> actually my code is borked, nvm
[13:54:37] <Evan_Donovan> i'm trying to get audio.js to work with jquery mobile...however it appears that whenever i use the ajax loading functionality of jquery mobile the audio js javascript either doesn't get loaded or doesn't execute
[13:54:50] <Evan_Donovan> this means that the audios on my site don't show up
[13:55:01] <Evan_Donovan> i'm using the Drupal CMS as the base for my site
[13:55:58] <Evan_Donovan> to see the problem simply click on one of the links from http://media.urbansermons.net/m/audio-list/term/6711
[13:58:21] <elijah> (noob) Is there a way I can execute a function upon completion of a fieldset expanding? I am running into an issue on a click handler not working when clicking a large fieldset because it executes before the fieldset is fully expanding and the DOM isn't solid yet.
[13:59:19] <Evan_Donovan> elijah: you could use javascript's delay function to wait a bit; i've forgotten the specific name for it
[13:59:35] <chinoto> setTimeout
[13:59:36] <anyvie> setTimeout
[13:59:44] <Evan_Donovan> yup that's it
[13:59:51] <zfly9> Where on this plugin https://raw.github.com/malsup/cycle/master/jquery.cycle.lite.js can I add $(this).addClass('current-slide') to give the current slide a class
[14:00:01] <chinoto> setTimeout(func, delay_in_ms)
[14:00:16] <anyvie> It would be cleaner to define a callback to the expand
[14:00:41] <elijah> Evan_Donovan: Hey Evan! We met at DrupalCon SF
[14:00:47] <Evan_Donovan> it looks like my issue is possibly related to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7205868/jquery-mobile-application-to-load-an-external-page-and-run-js-script-when-a-butt
[14:01:08] <Evan_Donovan> elijah: sorry, i'm not remembering you offhand
[14:01:11] <elijah> Evan_Donovan: You talked with me in the hallway for about 30-60 minutes and told me about base64 encoding images into css!
[14:01:38] <elijah> Evan_Donovan: It's okay if you don't remember me
[14:01:47] <Evan_Donovan> sorry...
[14:02:17] <elijah> so I was going down the setTimeout road but really wasn't happy with waiting 100ms+ to call my function
[14:02:58] <elijah> Plus, every browser will be expanding this fieldset at different time depending on their hardward.
[14:03:01] <elijah> *hardware
[14:03:08] <mhn23_> what if my browser doesn't work properly and all other browsers and the same one on 3+ machines still work? (it's safari lol)
[14:03:23] <mhn23_> everybody fires the script and seems to work.
[14:03:39] <anyvie> elijah, what are you using to do your expand ?
[14:03:40] <mhn23_> here is the site: http://ngoc-vu.com/
[14:03:45] <anyvie> an animate ?
[14:04:17] <mhn23_> in the german version the animation on the navigation click works everywhere except my safari. its weird
[14:04:17] <elijah> anyvie: It is Drupal, lemme check.
[14:05:51] <anyvie> elijah: if it's a jquery animate() or slideDown() function, you can so define your own callback function, which will be called when the animation is finished
[14:06:19] <Evan_Donovan> so does anyone know about the issue with loading javascript inside of a jquery mobile ajax page load?
[14:06:59] <elijah> anyvie: That is a good idea! I am still checking
[14:07:46] <anyvie> Evan_Donovan, what's exactly the issue : the JS is not executed ?
[14:07:56] <anyvie> are your ajax requests jsonp ?
[14:08:02] <Evan_Donovan> the js for the audiojs player is not getting executed
[14:08:15] <Evan_Donovan> i don't know whether it is jsonp - it is whatever jquery mobile uses
[14:09:52] <jehee> Hi, I have an issue with my menu http://jsbin.com/esovuf/2 as you can see the menu items change color on hover and stays that way. That is the point, however, I want to change back to the original colour on hover out. How can I do this?
[14:10:34] <WDKevin> $("input[type=checkbox][name=form_data[requested_materials]]")
[14:10:48] <WDKevin> that selector doesn't seem to obey the [requested_materials] portion
[14:10:51] <WDKevin> what gives?
[14:12:44] <anyvie> jehee, use CSS attribute hover. Ex: .main-category:hover
[14:13:06] <jehee> that will stop the color exchange as soon as the mouse leaves the "Menu 1"
[14:13:14] <jehee> I want it enlighten as long as the under menu is open
[14:13:32] <anyvie> I see
[14:15:02] <chinoto> alright so can anyone think of a way to do this better (an event handler on an element that is repetitively added and removed from DOM)? http://jsbin.com/uqeyat/5/edit
[14:15:42] <anyvie> jehee, so, one other trick is to reset all the color in your ddmenu_open, before changing the good one
[14:16:04] <jehee> true that
[14:16:53] <jehee> anyvie one issue though
[14:17:34] <jehee> http://jsbin.com/esovuf/4/edit
[14:17:48] <jehee> look at menu 3 and menu 5 and hover them. THey have no under categories.
[14:18:57] <anyvie> jehee, what's the issue with them ?
[14:19:11] <jehee> they dont switch back on hoverout
[14:19:18] <jehee> to its original color
[14:19:32] <jehee> only when another menu item is hovered
[14:20:11] <B|aster> hey when I'm inside an event handler, and I have a $.ajax, how can I reference the $(this) from the event handler?
[14:20:11] <jehee> I need to reset the colours on ddmenu close
[14:20:16] <jehee> but I dont know how to do this
[14:20:19] <B|aster> it seems to not be referencable anymore when inside $.ajax
[14:20:51] <jehee> anyvie got it now
[14:21:00] <chinoto> actually, I just thought of something, delegation! I'll just bind the event to $td2 and have a selector for '#hl', voila! No more attributes :D
[14:21:00] <anyvie> B|aster, var currentObject = $(this); before the $.ajax, and inside, use currentObject
[14:21:11] <B|aster> what about $.proxy?
[14:21:34] <anyvie> idk, I use a temp var for that
[14:22:01] <chinoto> but then $td2 ends up listening to a lot of events and has to filter them :/
[14:22:20] <fulld> It is possible to retrieve a list of actions that are attached to an element? I.E. I have a button, and when I click it something is happening, but I don't know why.
[14:22:22] <anyvie> Oo
[14:24:17] <anyvie> chinoto
[14:24:23] <chinoto> eh?
[14:24:53] <anyvie> I suggest you to make an hidden div with the "click me" which will be visible on CSS :hover
[14:25:21] <anyvie> and why use attr('onclick' instead of .click(function() { ?
[14:25:59] <chinoto> because click didn't work, but I found a different way, I'll show in a bit
[14:26:46] <chinoto> anyvie: http://jsbin.com/uqeyat/6/edit
[14:27:33] <chinoto> the thing is, $hl shouldn't exist in $td2, so I remove it when it isn't needed
[14:28:28] <chinoto> though I guess I could give it a display:none; placeholder that I would append it to for when it isn't shown in one of the divs
[14:28:59] <chinoto> maybe that would make it retain the event, since it isn't removed from the DOM
[14:29:10] <anyvie> hum
[14:29:35] <anyvie> with the most recent link (which is much better :p), what's the issue ?
[14:29:42] <anyvie> The highlight is working
[14:30:13] <chinoto> no issue, just showing you the latest idea since you didn't seem to understand
[14:30:22] <anyvie> oh
[14:34:56] <chinoto> anyvie: placeholder works :) http://jsbin.com/uqeyat/7/edit
[14:35:44] <chinoto> It probably has the best performance, so I'm going with it
[14:36:31] <anyvie> hum
[14:37:45] <anyvie> I think you can have better perfs
[14:37:50] <anyvie> I will try something
[14:41:10] <zfly9> Where on this plugin https://raw.github.com/malsup/cycle/master/jquery.cycle.lite.js can I add $(this).addClass('current-slide') to give the current slide a class
[14:43:53] <anyvie> chinoto, ok, nevermind, it's cool like this :) Just a thing : "click me" is persistent.
[14:44:16] <chinoto> what do you mean?
[14:44:43] <anyvie> When I hover an element, Click me appears. When I'm out of the area, it still there
[14:45:10] <zfly9> ... no one?
[14:45:19] <chinoto> DOH!
[14:45:43] <anyvie> ^
[14:45:58] <chinoto> bingo, wrong selector
[14:46:41] <wachpwnski> What is the best way to spawn nested elements? Is it to clone a template or what?
[14:47:40] <chinoto> wachpwnski: depends on your intent as to what is best, but we clone templates for our form
[14:48:04] <chinoto> multiple addresses, phone numbers, emails, etc
[14:48:05] <mstrcnvs> What's the best way to know if a query returned results? I'm currently doing this way: "if (qry && qry.length > 0) { ... }"
[14:48:22] <pachet> mstrcnvs: just $().length should be enough
[14:48:34] <chinoto> I usually just say if (query.length) {...}
[14:48:35] <anyvie> zfly9, you can use after/before callbacks
[14:49:06] <zfly9> how so? I just want the current slide to have a class
[14:49:14] <zfly9> rookie to this though
[14:49:37] <mstrcnvs> pachet, chinoto: thank you :)
[14:49:43] <anyvie> I don't use jquery cycle lite, but I'm seeing this callbacks in options : http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/lite/
[14:50:46] <chinoto> anyvie: ok, now I believe it is as close to perfect as it is gonna get: http://jsbin.com/uqeyat/9/edit
[14:51:36] <anyvie> chinoto, it's functionnal, and pretty good
[14:51:38] <chinoto> removed the id for #hl_place and just use parent()
[14:51:46] <anyvie> You can improve that
[14:51:59] <anyvie> UI : the click can be tricky due to the drag effect
[14:52:19] <chinoto> in the full thing, I have delay and distance on the sortable
[14:52:22] <anyvie> It would be perfect if the "Click me" was not draggable
[14:52:51] <chinoto> in the full thing, I have an element within that which is used as a handle
[14:52:55] <jaya> Hello
[14:52:57] <anyvie> ok
[14:53:11] <chinoto> I really like how it's coming along
[14:53:17] <anyvie> yeah
[14:53:47] <chinoto> btw, it's for an email editor, you drag templates in and edit them with ckeditor
[14:54:12] <chinoto> it's pretty awesome if I say so myself :D
[14:54:14] <jaya> how to do user typing area in JS/Jquery
[14:54:18] <jaya> ??
[14:54:26] <jaya> http://hackquest.com/asas
[14:54:32] <jaya> Anyone ?
[14:54:58] <mikerapin> jaya what are you trying to do exactly?
[14:55:12] <anyvie> chinoto, yeah, I see the idea. It's a good step :) Integration with CKEditor (and make it easy to use) will not be easy.
[14:55:13] <chinoto> jaya: it's only been 20 seconds, calm down...
[14:55:34] <chinoto> anyvie: actually, that bit is already done, it's just polishing I need to work on
[14:55:40] <jaya> i'm re-doing http://hackquest.com/asas
[14:55:47] <CJKay> chilversc: This calc() polyfill is surprisingly fast
[14:55:51] <jaya> http://pastebin.com/KxdNAtct
[14:55:54] <anyvie> oh !
[14:56:03] <chinoto> like masking other blocks when editting
[14:56:17] <jaya> Instead of user typing ...Text data printed Whole Some
[14:56:20] <jaya> Getting it ?
[14:56:31] <mikerapin> yeah
[14:56:42] <mikerapin> couldn't you convert the text you want printed into an arry
[14:56:47] <chilversc> CJKay: cool
[14:56:57] <mikerapin> then loop through the array and append the text to to the contents of the text area?
[14:57:03] <CJKay> Pixel and percentage addition working
[14:57:03] <jaya> Yes it's already in Array
[14:57:35] <jaya> It's happening too soon even setTimeout >> 10 seconds won't work
[14:57:39] <chinoto> anyvie: I'll just set all the blocks to z-index:0, overlay to z-index:1, and the block being editted to z-index:2
[14:57:56] <anyvie> I understand
[14:58:37] <jaya> mikerapin ..It's not that simple....I want to do exactly the thing done in that web page
[15:03:33] <amccloud_> Is there anyway to get which submit button/input was clicked on submit?
[15:06:05] <anyvie> yeah, bind a click event with a function using $(this) (and use a different ID/Class for each button)
[15:06:43] <wavesounds> Anyone have any experience loading jquery plugins in wordpress? Im trying to include the masonry plugin and im getting an error in the console from inside the masonry.js file saying jQuery is not defined
[15:10:03] <StephenS> when I make one ajax call, how can I return mutliplevalues?
[15:10:45] <StephenS> lets say I do three sql queries at one ajax call, and then return json for msg_notification: 0 }.. new_msg: 1 etc.. and then compare it inside ajax call and update the rest of html page, how would I do it?
[15:10:49] <chinoto> json
[15:12:05] <chinoto> StephenS: just make each query be an element of the array that json is representing
[15:12:11] <StephenS> chinoto, you mean while I call php and output it with php?
[15:12:22] <StephenS> any example where I can see the idea?
[15:12:50] <chinoto> well I figure you could say something like this:
[15:14:22] <jaya> Guys Help me Out !@
[15:14:24] <chinoto> $temp=[]; foreach ($_REQUEST['queries'] as $query) {$temp[]=$db->query($query)->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC);} echo json_encode($temp);
[15:14:51] <StephenS> nah
[15:15:00] <StephenS> I just ask how to compare json data inside ajax call?
[15:15:07] <StephenS> as I update html divs instantly on some interval..
[15:15:35] <chinoto> you'll have to explain to someone else better, I got work to do :/
[15:28:46] <terinjokes> i have a UI question. i have a table widget with row widgets, and I want to sort the row widgets by some criteria. is the only way to delete all the rows (thus the widgets) and redraw?
[15:28:47] <zfly9> Anyone know how I can use addClass to put a class "current-slide" on the displayed slide on this http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/lite/
[15:28:57] <terinjokes> i don't see any patterns for this.
[15:29:45] <chinoto> terinjokes: can you use append on them?
[15:29:53] <eddiemonge> terinjokes: are you talking about something like jqueryui sortable?
[15:30:15] <terinjokes> eddiemonge: no, that's for a user to rearrange widgets with their mouse
[15:30:39] <terinjokes> chinoto: yes, but I have all the elements in the wrong order at the top of the table
[15:32:11] <eddiemonge> terinjokes: ok then how are they generated? can you generate them in the correct order?
[15:32:33] <kristofers> I have multiple table rows, where A * B = C
[15:32:59] <kristofers> i have the formula, it works for the first row, and then all the others the result of them are the result of the first row
[15:33:11] <chinoto> terinjokes: then just select all of them with jquery, sort them into an array, then say $.each(sorted_elements,function(k,v){$('#my_table').append(v)})
[15:33:23] <terinjokes> eddiemonge: yes, that's not the issueâ€¦ the issue is right now I have to remove all the old widget, which in UI 1.10 seems to have gotten VERY expensive
[15:33:36] <chinoto> probably want to cache $('#my_table')
[15:33:53] <chinoto> why do you have to remove the widget?
[15:34:07] <chinoto> is the widget dependent on arrangement?
[15:34:31] <eddiemonge> kristofers: say what? do you have code example? like google docs spreadsheet?
[15:34:45] <kristofers> putting in js one minute
[15:34:53] <terinjokes> chinoto: there's two widgets, the table and the rows
[15:35:07] <eddiemonge> terinjokes: so you are using jquery ui? is the widget custom?
[15:35:30] <terinjokes> the table responds to an event to change the ordering, it gets all the children row widgets, removes them from the DOM, then re-renders in the correct order
[15:35:36] <chinoto> so if you use append while the widget is active, it breaks the widget?
[15:36:37] <terinjokes> chinoto: well noâ€¦ just if I don't remove the widgets, i end up with multiple
[15:37:08] <chinoto> terinjokes: really? you sure you're not using clone instead of append?
[15:37:39] <terinjokes> chinoto: actually the table creates whole new row widgetsâ€¦ that's what worked previously
[15:37:50] <terinjokes> before it became very expensive to do so.
[15:38:55] <eddiemonge> do you have code example?
[15:39:29] <terinjokes> negative
[15:40:36] <LocalPCGuy> best practice question - all your JS in one single file (obviously minified/concatenated) or all global JS in a single file and the one unique file per section for JS common to that sections of the site?
[15:41:52] <chinoto> hmm, how about all global js in it's own file, and page specific js in the page?
[15:42:09] <LocalPCGuy> I don't want any JS in my page
[15:42:11] <chinoto> actually, no
[15:42:16] <chinoto> that was dumb
[15:42:41] <LocalPCGuy> maybe a really small initialization would be ok, but looking for a more general thought
[15:42:53] <LocalPCGuy> about best practices
[15:42:54] <kristofers> actually it makes no sense what i'm doing i'm just lost
[15:43:52] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/EaK3z/3/
[15:44:08] <kristofers> i'm a bit lost, cause i have dynamic rows that can be added
[15:44:13] <kristofers> everything worked fine with 1 row
[15:45:14] <kristofers> the $('.mining-table').on('keyup', is what i'm working on to make it work with the dynamic rows
[15:45:20] <eddiemonge> LocalPCGuy: thats what we do. or you could look at something like RequireJS
[15:45:37] <terinjokes> eddiemonge: it's very possible the custom widgets are doing something wrong, mostly interested in what the correct thing to do
[15:45:50] <LocalPCGuy> eddiemonge one file or two per page with one being the section specific?
[15:46:14] <LocalPCGuy> and unfortunately requireJS is out of scope right now.  Maybe the next project
[15:46:31] <eddiemonge> kristofers: you need context
[15:46:57] <eddiemonge> $('.m-ttvalue').val() pulls only the first value and not the specific one you want
[15:47:47] <chinoto> kristofers: to make things easier on yourself and jquery, put that huge <tr> inside a display:none tbody and clone it as needed
[15:48:51] <StephenS> When I append some txt to page javascript is not executed
[15:48:52] <StephenS> why is that?
[15:49:34] <eddiemonge> kristofers: look at using either `this` or .next() or .siblings() or the like
[15:49:42] <LocalPCGuy> stephenS we need more than that to work on, maybe a fiddle or example code?
[15:49:44] <eddiemonge> StephenS: because you are appending text and not running js
[15:49:54] <eddiemonge> ?loadscript @ StephenS
[15:49:56] <bot-t> StephenS, jQuery.getScript() | jQuery API Documentation - Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[15:50:10] <StephenS> this is how I do it http://jsfiddle.net/eDDeZ/1/
[15:50:11] <LocalPCGuy> or eddiemonge knows the answer :P
[15:50:26] <StephenS> but I append some elemtns which have js elements inside
[15:53:07] <eddiemonge> StephenS: it works
[15:53:27] <eddiemonge> just as you have it
[15:53:31] <StephenS> noit does not http://jsfiddle.net/eDDeZ/3/
[15:53:45] <StephenS> click on :clickme and then click in input field
[15:53:55] <StephenS> field should disappear as it have unique id but it does not disappear
[15:53:58] <eddiemonge> thats a different example
[15:54:06] <eddiemonge> for that you need to delegate
[15:54:35] <StephenS> that is second example with delegation yes
[15:54:48] <eddiemonge> StephenS: if you are really using 1.4.2 then you need to use .live()
[15:55:09] <StephenS> I do use live instead of on
[15:56:27] <chinoto> I think I'm just gonna give up and use delegation for my problem as well, trying to avoid my element getting removed (and it's events being discarded) is a pain
[15:56:45] <LocalPCGuy> or upgrade to a newer version of jQuery (which would be preferred, I think)
[15:56:56] <eddiemonge> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/eDDeZ/4/
[15:57:00] <StephenS> I cant upgrade
[15:57:03] <StephenS> there is xxx errors
[15:57:10] <kristofers> I understand that the m-ttvalue.val is giving me the first one, but i'm confused on how i should write this
[15:57:13] <eddiemonge> StephenS: then fix the errors
[15:57:54] <LocalPCGuy> chinoto if you listen at a high enough level with event delegation, you should be able to add/remove elements at will without worrying about the events
[15:57:59] <chinoto> StephenS: upgrade now and deal with a few errors, or do it later and deal with a ton
[15:58:28] <StephenS> the fact is when I upgrade and fix console errors
[15:58:40] <StephenS> some things still does not work and cannot debug which one without error
[15:58:52] <chinoto> LocalPCGuy: I realize that, but I didn't like the idea of listening to all the other events.
[15:58:56] <eddiemonge> kristofers: for one thing, dont use ids in duplicated elements
[15:59:03] <kristofers> i'm not
[15:59:18] <kristofers> i though i changed all the id's to class
[15:59:29] <eddiemonge> the ids are still there
[15:59:36] <kristofers> yeah but i'm not using it
[15:59:37] <LocalPCGuy> chinoto what do you mean, listening to all the other events?  Your event handlers should be able to differentiate between the events based on which element they are on
[15:59:43] <kristofers> i'll remove it
[16:00:22] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS you just have to take it one error at a time and knock them out
[16:01:46] <chinoto> LocalPCGuy: when you use $('sel1').on('event','sel2',func), it listens to all events that bubble to sel1 and discards ones that don't match sel2.
[16:02:03] <eddiemonge> kristofers: here is a start: http://jsfiddle.net/EaK3z/4/
[16:02:11] <LocalPCGuy> chinoto and is that causing a performance problem?
[16:02:21] <LocalPCGuy> chinoto the events are bubbling regardless
[16:03:03] <chinoto> I was just about to say it isn't a big deal since I'm just using click, not something like mousemove
[16:03:09] <LocalPCGuy> chinoto and I would venture to say that having a number of event handlers attached to the DOM is more of a performance hit than listening to all events that bubble up and discarding the ones that don't match
[16:03:25] <chinoto> bubbling doesn't matter if you're not listening for it, but it can matter if you are listening for it
[16:03:43] <LocalPCGuy> chinoto but IS it mattering in your case?
[16:04:16] <chinoto> like I just said, it isn't a big deal, I just prefer not resorting to it
[16:04:26] <neeky> I think I may be breaking the "multi-page, single file" rules in jquery Mobile, but I need to confirm it's not a bug first
[16:04:42] <neeky> I can't get this page working properly: http://jsfiddle.net/tAfyA/
[16:04:47] <StephenS> so how would you do it with hidden close button on hoover eddiemonge http://jsfiddle.net/eDDeZ/5/ ?
[16:05:04] <chinoto> either way I only use one event handler on a single element
[16:05:17] <terinjokes> hrm, $.remove seems to be much slower than $.empty
[16:05:26] <neeky> It may not work in jsfiddle, but it works on a mbile browser, EXCEPT page1 navbar is not styled - it's just a list
[16:05:58] <eddiemonge> StephenS: do what? its the same thing
[16:05:59] <neeky> but if I navigate other pages, the navbar is perfect
[16:06:10] <LocalPCGuy> chinoto ah...well, that is different - as far as I know it's best practice to use delegation when dealing with multiple elements with the same event, but a single one...only time to use delegation then is if the element is dynamic (cough cough)
[16:06:15] <StephenS> how me an example
[16:06:21] <StephenS> its not the same as I have multiple forms
[16:06:27] <neeky> I'm trying to make the app's navigation re-usable across all pages
[16:07:03] <eddiemonge> StephenS: its exactly the same. its still event delegation
[16:07:10] <eddiemonge> ?live @ StephenS
[16:07:10] <b-ot> StephenS: deprecated
[16:07:11] <bot-t> StephenS, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[16:07:19] <neeky> If I put a fake first page, then quickly navigate to page2, it works, but thats a hack
[16:07:26] <chinoto> LocalPCGuy: I had intended on just appending the element to a display:none div, but certain other things caused it to get removed, along with it's event handler, so I'm going to use delegation
[16:07:36] <kristofers> Thanks eddie i'll check it out,
[16:07:38] <LocalPCGuy> gotcha
[16:08:03] <eddiemonge> StephenS: oh good it was 1.4.2. read this page and use this instead of .live() http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[16:08:13] <chinoto> anyway, I want to get this done, seeya
[16:09:12] <zuloyd> hi
[16:09:51] <neeky> If anything, I'd say this should work in reverse: 1st page navbar styled, the rest not
[16:10:03] <zuloyd> using the jquery.get method and callbacks for success and failure, I can produce a situation where the get succeeds or fails just based on the content of the file that should be loaded
[16:10:06] <zuloyd> is this expected behaviour?
[16:10:12] <neeky> http://jsfiddle.net/tAfyA/
[16:10:25] <zuloyd> I have a file templates.html. If I put one <script> block in there, the .get succeeds. If there are two, it fails
[16:13:00] <eddiemonge> zuloyd: what content type are you expecting and declaring?
[16:14:24] <zuloyd> I'm expecting html
[16:14:28] <zuloyd> I don't declare anything
[16:17:32] <eddiemonge> zuloyd: any reason you are returning scripts in your html fragments?
[16:17:40] <StephenS> eddiemonge, here http://jsfiddle.net/eDDeZ/6/ what is wrong with it?
[16:17:49] <StephenS> It desnt even call xhover..
[16:17:56] <zuloyd> eddiemonge: I'm trying to build a templating engine with templates resting in an external file
[16:18:23] <zuloyd> they are tags like this: <script id="tpl-mytemplate" type="text/html"> template here </script>
[16:18:57] <zuloyd> I just want to extract what's in between <script ...> and </script>
[16:18:58] <eddiemonge> StephenS: first, it should be $('.extra').delegate('.closeshow',hiddenclose); otherwise you are binding the return value of hiddenclose
[16:19:07] <quantax-> have you thought of using an existing templating engine like handlebars ?
[16:19:14] <eddiemonge> StephenS: second, its weird to add an event handler in an event handler
[16:19:30] <zuloyd> eddiemonge: actually I wanted to use mustache
[16:19:37] <eddiemonge> zuloyd: whats the error you are getting?
[16:19:40] <zuloyd> but it doesn't support external files per default
[16:19:45] <zuloyd> eddiemonge: no error
[16:19:51] <zuloyd> it just goes into the .fail callback
[16:19:58] <StephenS> can u do it your way?
[16:20:17] <eddiemonge> zuloyd: no idea since i dont use mustache
[16:21:29] <neeky> zuloyd: you and I are trying to solve the exact ame problem
[16:21:56] <neeky> but i AM using mustache as it should
[16:22:17] <zuloyd> what do you mean as it should?
[16:22:37] <neeky> the only problem is that I have a single html with multiple <div data-role="page">'s
[16:22:39] <chinoto> ok, so that worked well
[16:22:52] <eddiemonge> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/eDDeZ/7/
[16:23:21] <neeky> zuloyd: in other words, I'm trying to use a mustache temple to add navigation links to a navbar
[16:23:47] <neeky> but to every page->footer->navbar in the file
[16:24:01] <chinoto> specifically, it seems that sortable must be removing my elements than appending them back if I use helper:'clone'
[16:24:10] <neeky> but it works on all pages in the file except the first one
[16:24:16] <neeky> it comes out unstyled
[16:24:17] <StephenS> u fu*** ROCK!
[16:26:29] <StephenS> however on x click, form does not hide... eddiemonge
[16:27:40] <StephenS> nvm works as charm now :)
[16:27:45] <eddiemonge> StephenS: theres nothing in there that says for it to hide
[16:27:53] <StephenS> yeah I have added it now
[16:28:05] <StephenS> I have a confusing code, and having trouble to see what is what and where..
[16:28:31] <StephenS> Also is there a way to send some rate via ajax, but rate is in js as well, like i rate 5 out of 10 stars and hold it somewhere and not really send it to the db
[17:15:41] <naeluh> how is everyone!!!
[17:16:05] <terinjokes> grumpy
[17:16:12] <chinoto> hungry
[17:16:18] <chinoto> I just ate an apple
[17:16:32] <chinoto> I think I need a banana
[17:17:09] <naeluh> I am having a bit of an issue I am trying to my content elements to fadeIn and fadeOut with the zoomooz plugin I can't quite figure it out I also am starving well maybe not starving but pretty hungry
[17:17:13] <terinjokes> chinoto: i resolved my earlier issue (sorta) by in the row's _destroy method calling $.empty, then doing a setTimeout and then $.remove to reclaim the memory later
[17:17:15] <naeluh> here is my fiddle so far
[17:17:53] <naeluh> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/JXaAM/#base
[17:18:12] <chinoto> terinjokes: is there a place I could see this?
[17:18:15] <terinjokes> chinoto: the correct solution is to simply reorder the widgets in the DOM, but that's too difficult of a change for this legacy widget for now
[17:19:10] <terinjokes> chinoto: the widgets in question? yes, i suppose, but the JS is minifiedâ€¦
[17:19:40] <naeluh> I feel like I could add .fadeIn somewhere but I am not sure where to add it :-(
[17:22:52] <smftre> Hey guys, I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/7PZyv/ -< how do I get it to read the second child div?
[17:23:24] <neeky> can someone look at this super simple example of my issue? http://jsfiddle.net/fD79N/1/
[17:23:42] <neeky> the first page's navbar won't style, no matter what I do
[17:24:11] <neeky> I stripped my code down to the simplest example that still exhibits the behavior
[17:24:41] <neeky> multi-page in a single file, using a mustache template to deliver navigation
[17:25:04] <chinoto> smftre: $("#content .content:nth-child(2)")
[17:25:13] <smftre> thnx
[17:25:45] <chinoto> more reliable than what I was going to suggest: $($("#content .content")[1])
[17:26:10] <chinoto> because 1 might not exist and so you get errors
[17:26:30] <smftre> chinoto: but sometimes there isnt the second item, only the first one, so want to check for any children that have it really
[17:26:39] <smftre> if any do then it's true
[17:26:54] <smftre> know what i mean?
[17:27:48] <smftre> I suppose I could just do 2 statements
[17:28:00] <smftre> chinoto: like so: http://jsfiddle.net/7PZyv/1/
[17:28:43] <smftre> actually, I could just do: $("#content .content, #content .content:nth-child(2)")
[17:28:47] <smftre> that would work too
[17:28:51] <smftre> I think LO
[17:28:58] <chinoto> that's redundant
[17:29:09] <smftre> but it works
[17:29:55] <chinoto> no I mean it is entirely redundant, the first bit will select the second bit
[17:30:15] <neeky> http://jsfiddle.net/fD79N/5/ < even more clear, with pages labeled to show navigation is working
[17:31:28] <chinoto> smftre: http://jsfiddle.net/7PZyv/2/
[17:31:43] <GoSox> not sure how to word this question but
[17:32:05] <GoSox> you can do $(".class div"). to bind to divs in "class"
[17:32:18] <GoSox> what if i wanted to bind to divs in "this"?
[17:32:26] <GoSox> $(this) > div
[17:32:33] <GoSox> is that something you can do?
[17:32:35] <LocalPCGuy> $(this).find('div')
[17:38:01] <smftre> I think this shows it better: http://jsfiddle.net/7PZyv/5/
[17:38:07] <smftre> but the logs never get run
[17:39:09] <smftre> hold on, my each is broken..
[17:40:12] <chinoto> smftre: dunno how that didn't result in an error in the console...
[17:40:17] <coldhead> so cold
[17:40:44] <smftre> chinoto: mean something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/7PZyv/8/
[17:41:54] <smftre> make sense?
[17:44:39] <chinoto> smftre: http://jsfiddle.net/7PZyv/9/
[17:44:51] <chinoto> efficiency ftw!
[17:49:30] <chinoto> just playing around with ideas, anyone know a more efficient way of doing this?
[17:49:35] <chinoto> var a=$('body *'); a.not(a.parents()).effect('highlight',5000);
[17:50:33] <LocalPCGuy> what are you trying to select?  All body elements that are links that don't have a parent?
[17:51:25] <chinoto> everything that has no children... that gives me an idea...
[17:51:36] <coldhead> castration?
[17:52:24] <tw2113> *crosses legs*
[17:52:50] <LocalPCGuy> What is the use case for that chinoto,
[17:54:04] <chinoto> absolutely nothing, as I said, just playing with ideas
[17:54:05] <chinoto> $('*').filter(function(){return !$(this).children().length})
[17:54:28] <chinoto> hmm

[17:56:31] <phxtrack> Any developers here familiar with Spotify looking for a paid opportunity on a project?
[18:08:22] <naeluh> hI guys and gals I am getting close - I am getting the functionality I want but for only one of my links I am trying to make all Is there anyway to get link 1 and 2 to function like link 3 in this example http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/952LA/\
[18:08:31] <naeluh> I am just stumped ...
[18:08:46] <naeluh> I am a stump

[18:10:56] <GoSox> is there an easy way to toggle "visibility" of an element?
[18:12:01] <LocalPCGuy> GoSox easy to do with a class - .toggleClass('hide')
[18:12:15] <LocalPCGuy> GoSox with the CSS adding the visibility
[18:12:19] <LocalPCGuy> or removing it
[18:12:28] <GoSox> i see
[18:12:30] <GoSox> ok
[18:12:46] <chinoto> GoSox: or use ".css( propertyName, function(index, value) )"
[18:12:59] <GoSox> o_O
[18:13:01] <chinoto> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[18:13:17] <chinoto> scroll down a little before half way
[18:13:25] <LocalPCGuy> chinoto better practice to do it with a CSS class, let CSS do the styling like it should be
[18:13:36] <LocalPCGuy> better separation of concerns
[18:13:51] <chinoto> it's still css :P
[18:13:53] <chinoto> but I agree
[18:14:46] <chinoto> and with the class you have a marker in case you need it
[18:15:27] <LocalPCGuy> yup, plus makes it easy to use CSS3 transitions if you feel like spicing things up
[18:16:15] <GoSox> What is this, the spice channel!
[18:16:19] <GoSox> HAHAH hilarious. Upvote me.
[18:16:29] <LocalPCGuy> naelug both your event handlers are on the links, is one of those supposed to be div that is focused?
[18:16:36] * chinoto upvotes GoSox 
[18:16:50] <GoSox> it's not squiggley enough to be the spice channel :)
[18:17:06] <LocalPCGuy> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[18:17:18] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy: not I just need the functionality of link 3 where it shows the zoomed div
[18:17:52] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy: I think I need both maybe
[18:17:58] <LocalPCGuy> naeluh you shouldn't
[18:18:16] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy: ok
[18:18:18] <naeluh> cool
[18:18:50] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy: so which one should I remove ?
[18:19:13] <naeluh> it stinks I am so close
[18:19:14] <LocalPCGuy> naeluh it's not that simple, but by having two you are introducing some odd interactions
[18:19:32] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy: oh ok
[18:20:31] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy:  so should I try to combine them into one event ?
[18:20:48] <LocalPCGuy> naeluh that would be more ideal than the two you have
[18:21:20] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy: see this is where I need some help
[18:23:26] <chinoto> getting elements without children: "$('*').not(':has(*)')" works as expected, but this doesn't "$(':not(:has(*))')"
[18:26:00] <chinoto> nvm that didn't work, my browser wasn't displaying it right for some reason
[18:30:53] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy: http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/R6bgN/ how bout this ?
[18:31:43] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy: but now its acting weirder it zoom back and the first one wont doesnt do the same as the others
[18:31:59] <naeluh> it doesnt zoom back
[18:32:16] <LocalPCGuy> naeluh I don't know anything about the zoom plugin you are using
[18:32:30] <naeluh> ok cool
[18:32:35] <naeluh> thanks
[18:32:36] <LocalPCGuy> naeluh but the rest of the code seems fine
[18:33:08] <chinoto> huh, so "$(':not(:has(*))')" was what I was looking for, neat!
[18:33:16] <GoSox> can you use tag:nth-child() inside a jquery selector?
[18:33:27] <jcblitz> Is there a selector to get the 10th p tag of a document regardless of parent? CSS3 has nth-child(x) but that takes the parent into consideration
[18:33:40] <LocalPCGuy> chinoto congrats!  You win the award for worst performing selector of all time! ( j/k )
[18:34:12] <chinoto> LocalPCGuy: hey, it's better than the other one
[18:35:18] <RehpotsirhC> Good evening. Is it possible to modify a url generated from the backend with jquery to update 1 or 2 paramaters based on what the user does?
[18:35:18] <chinoto> odd, firefox didn't like me using it to highlight stuff
[18:35:44] <chinoto> RehpotsirhC: you mean change the get arguments?
[18:37:12] <LocalPCGuy> naeluh http://jsfiddle.net/localpcguy/R6bgN/1/ just to show that the rest of the code works (although fadeIn() and show() do the same thing)
[18:37:21] <RehpotsirhC> chinoto, Correct, while leaving everything else intact
[18:37:31] <chinoto> change the values of "a" and "b": http://example.com/?a=1&b=2
[18:38:17] <RehpotsirhC> chinoto, Yes, but from jQuery.
[18:38:23] <LocalPCGuy> well, almost the same thing
[18:38:25] <naeluh> LocalPCGuy: thanks for your help that works for sure I am going to get this working for sure now
[18:38:46] <chinoto> regex replace could easily do it, if there isn't something that will do it for you
[18:40:05] <chinoto> though what you should do is have the backend provide javascript with a bare url and an object of default parameters using json_encode() (or whatever your server's language uses for json)
[18:45:09] <chinoto> huh, apparently javascript doesn't support lookbehind
[18:45:11] <chinoto> lame
[18:47:11] <chinoto> BAM:
[18:47:11] <chinoto> "http://blah.com/blah=4".replace(/blah=.*?(?:&|$)/,'blah=5')
[18:47:23] <chinoto> RehpotsirhC: ^^^
[18:47:57] <chinoto> ...woops
[18:48:06] <coldhead> http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/mimic-lookbehind-javascript
[18:48:28] <chinoto> "http://blah.com/blah=4".replace(/blah=.*?(?=&|$)/,'blah=5')
[18:48:57] <chinoto> coldhead: already looked at it, better this way for performance
[18:54:11] <Che-Anarc> Is there anyway I can read a .html file on drag drop on tiny_mce area to then just re-open in its </textarea> ?
[18:55:04] <chinoto> still playing with it: "http://blah.com/blah=4".replace(/(blah=).*?(?=&|$)/,'$15')
[18:55:17] <zarac> I have a bind_all_togglers function that binds *[class=toggler] on click to execute on_toggle. Is there a jQuery way of skipping multiple bindings on an event?
[18:56:49] <zarac> chinoto: What's your mission? : )
[18:58:12] <chinoto> zarac: RehpotsirhC wanted a way to replace the get arguments in a url, so I made a regex to do it, then I made it slightly better... he has yet to respond >.>
[18:58:36] <zarac> ah, ok : )
[18:58:36] <chinoto> hmm...
[18:59:49] <resting> is there a recommended html tag so jquery can reference to a html element instead of spamming the class?
[18:59:56] <systemfault> zarac: You mean? Like using event delegation?
[18:59:58] <zarac> Btw., my current solution is to use a namespace (i.e. on('click.toggler') and in bind_all_togglers do a .off('click.toggler') first.
[19:00:19] <coldhead> sometimes i wish for the long way
[19:00:20] <zarac> systemfault: Maybe i do. I'll check it out.
[19:00:23] <LocalPCGuy> resting what do you mean "spamming" the class?
[19:01:10] <zarac> systemfault: That's just plain awesomeness. Thanks, buddy! ; )
[19:01:24] <resting> LocalPCGuy: say i have a JSON response with the information of age that I want inserted into a <td>â€¦so i have to name this <td class="age"> that kind of thing
[19:01:37] <LocalPCGuy> resting and that is bad why?
[19:02:21] <LocalPCGuy> resting seems quite a bit better than some very specific dom tag selector that would break the instant the dom changes
[19:02:34] <resting> LocalPCGuy: i'm not sureâ€¦classes seems more inclined to cosmetics rather than data binding i think
[19:02:47] <GoSox> resting: id instead of class?
[19:02:52] <zarac> resting: What do you mean by "spamming the class" ?
[19:02:58] <LocalPCGuy> resting I disagree there, although if it is a unique element you could use an ID
[19:03:03] <GoSox> you'd need a million special html elements to make a typical dynamic page
[19:03:26] <zarac> oh
[19:03:27] <LocalPCGuy> resting the problem with an ID is that you can't reuse that
[19:03:37] <zarac> What about the data- attributes?
[19:03:50] <resting> GoSox: not reallyâ€¦something like data-attr="age" seems better
[19:03:51] <chinoto> RehpotsirhC: I believe it to be perfect! now to leave: "http://blah.com/?blah=4".replace(/(\?.*?)(blah)(?:=.*?|)(?=&|$)/,'$1$2=5')
[19:03:55] <zarac> ..and .data(..)
[19:04:00] <GoSox> resting: how so?
[19:04:03] <LocalPCGuy> zarac I wouldn't recommend a data attribute for that
[19:04:13] <LocalPCGuy> or resting
[19:04:20] <resting> the only problem is i'm afraid of IE...
[19:04:32] <GoSox> resting: just ignore IE and it will go away
[19:05:01] <resting> GoSox: wish i couldâ€¦then boss will ignore my salary too..
[19:05:01] <LocalPCGuy> resting IE + jQuery means data attributes work just fine.  But I would not recommend them for DOM manipulation
[19:05:19] <resting> LocalPCGuy: i see..so you'd go the class way?
[19:05:49] <GoSox> yeah i don't get why data attributes seem 'better' than a regular id attribute? id's are shorter, easier to type, easier to access in jquery. What is the upside to data attributes in this context?
[19:06:02] <LocalPCGuy> resting do it every day.  Experimenting with some of the MVC frameworks like Backbone/Knockout/Angular, but in the meantime, yah, classes are the way I do what you are talking about
[19:06:08] <zarac> Maybe I'm misunderstanding the issue here; but, what's bad with something like $('article[data-id=54]')?
[19:06:14] <resting> GoSox: the only upside i think is semantics..
[19:06:15] <LocalPCGuy> GoSox IDs are bad because you can't reuse them in a page
[19:06:28] <GoSox> reuse them how?
[19:06:38] <LocalPCGuy> zarac that is much less readable for another dev than $('.classname').
[19:06:57] <LocalPCGuy> GoSox maybe you have multiple blocks that have the same content repeated
[19:07:05] <LocalPCGuy> GoSox but with different data
[19:07:20] <resting> GoSox: if you have a list of person details to displayâ€¦you shouldn't have multiple #age tags...
[19:07:27] <GoSox> use IDs if you want to change one thing, and classes if you want to change a bunch
[19:07:59] <resting> yupâ€¦hmâ€¦okâ€¦guess i'll go with classes...
[19:07:59] <zarac> I strongly disagree. classes are for styling, not data; and it's the data that is used for referencing in this case.
[19:08:00] <LocalPCGuy> GoSox with classes, it would be easy to loop through your JSON data and apply each set of data to a single block, but keep each of those blocks pretty much the same
[19:08:21] <LocalPCGuy> zarac you are mistaken, sorry.  Data is for STORING data, not referencing DOM nodes
[19:08:31] * coldhead np: animal collective - amanita
[19:08:34] <zarac> resting: Don't go with classes. Do it the HTML5 way, use data-.
[19:09:01] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: And classes are for display, not for storing data.
[19:09:01] <GoSox> i only use data attributes when i need to pass an extra piece of data for jquery to use
[19:09:02] <LocalPCGuy> zarac data- is NOT the "html5" way.  Not for selectors.  Just because you can doesn't mean you should
[19:09:12] <resting> zarac: any idea hw well supported is that in IE? or at least IE 7
[19:09:13] <GoSox> i used one just today, data-cut="yes"
[19:09:16] <LocalPCGuy> zarac he is using the class as a selector
[19:09:23] <zarac> resting: www.caniuse.com
[19:09:25] <LocalPCGuy> zarac nothing "wrong" with that
[19:09:42] <resting> zarac: cool reference :)
[19:09:55] <LocalPCGuy> and resting data attributes are very well supported.  However, I implore you not to use them for this purpose
[19:10:02] <zarac> If it means using the class attribute to store data that's not part of the design, i say it is wrong.
[19:10:47] <LocalPCGuy> zarac one of us misunderstood - AFAIK he isn't using the class to STORE data, but as a selector to get a DOM node
[19:11:20] <LocalPCGuy> zarac and then append a value into the TEXT of the DOM node
[19:11:35] <zarac> resting: You could even use data-foo before HTML5. Using arbitrary attributes to store data is an old thing. It's just that it's so commonly used so, with HTML5, it was made standard.
[19:11:38] <LocalPCGuy> zarac if he is talking about storing data for later use, then I would agree with you
[19:11:43] <resting> that's rightâ€¦i just need a "tag" to select it
[19:12:03] <LocalPCGuy> zarac but I don't agree with using data attributes as selectors
[19:12:22] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: This is interesting. Why not? : )
[19:12:47] <GoSox> i disagree
[19:12:50] <GoSox> about it being interesting :D
[19:12:51] <zarac> What's wrong with the example i gave before? Something like $('article[data-id=1337]') ?
[19:12:52] <LocalPCGuy> zarac I've already explained that.  less readable, not their intended purpose, worse performing selector (although that doesn't matter anymore)
[19:13:09] <zarac> lol GoSox : )
[19:13:18] <resting> zarac: sadlyâ€¦dataset & data- isn't supported by ie 7
[19:13:19] <LocalPCGuy> zarac it is also less reusable
[19:14:41] <__machine> trying to use select2 ... all its code is inside a block like (function($, undefined) { ... })(jQuery)); ... the $.fn.select2 function is defined in there... but outside this block i get Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'select2' when I attempt $('select').select2(...); ... ?
[19:14:53] <zarac> Being less readable is an opinion, so I'll ignore that. About it not being an intended purpose... It's possible to select on attributes so isn't that the purpose?
[19:14:56] <resting> i certainly hope there's a better standard for people like us who isn't using a js frameworkâ€¦
[19:15:00] <zarac> And.. how is it less reusable?
[19:15:50] <LocalPCGuy> zarac possible.  not better than a simple classname which is a fine multipurpose tool
[19:16:11] <zarac> resting: It's still possible to use any attribute you want (even though it's not said so specifically).
[19:16:12] <LocalPCGuy> zarac well, if you'd rather litter your code with data-attr="543" everywhere
[19:16:28] * LocalPCGuy shakes head no
[19:17:04] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: How about in the case of my example? Don't you think it's ugly to clutter your class attribute with arbitrary numbers?
[19:17:27] <LocalPCGuy> zarac there is NO numbers going in the class in what resting is trying to do
[19:17:27] * zarac laughs
[19:17:30] <zarac> ; )
[19:17:35] <LocalPCGuy> zarac the numbers go in the TEXT
[19:17:46] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: I'm thinking universally.
[19:17:50] <resting> zarac: ya..like the example you gaveâ€¦but i would prefer to follow a standard "if there's any"
[19:17:55] <LocalPCGuy> zarac if you are storing data, then you would use data
[19:18:14] <LocalPCGuy> zarac if you are making a selector, I would add a class, not a data-attribute
[19:18:23] <LocalPCGuy> I see the difference pretty plain
[19:18:26] <zarac> resting: What is your specific example? : )
[19:18:50] <Guddu> Hi All...I get an error when i try to show a modal dialog...Error is Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dialog'   and my code is http://dpaste.com/1021228/ Please help. I am calling the function as this showDialog('Load Validated Successfully');
[19:19:05] <LocalPCGuy> zarac: <resting> LocalPCGuy: say i have a JSON response with the information of age that I want inserted into a <td>…so i have to name this <td class="age"> that kind of thing
[19:19:38] <zarac> But, designing the HTML structure after how you will later use js with is a bit strange, don't you think?
[19:19:41] <LocalPCGuy> and zarac: resting> that's right…i just need a "tag" to select it
[19:19:49] <resting> zarac: example you have a table of person's detail. age, name, DOB. you have to each <td> with a JSON responseâ€¦how would you name the selectors?
[19:20:02] <resting> *fill
[19:20:57] <zarac> resting: What is it you want to select?
[19:21:03] <LocalPCGuy> and resting you may want to look into something like Knockout or Backbone (even Angular)...that is what they are intended for
[19:21:42] <resting> zarac: the <td> tags for each attributes (age, name, dob)
[19:21:59] <resting> and fill in the JSON response
[19:22:40] <zarac> resting: Hahaha, then i'd use class. ; )
[19:22:40] <resting> LocalPCGuy: yaâ€¦but we're not using any of thoseâ€¦maybe in futureâ€¦but not at this moment..
[19:23:02] <LocalPCGuy> resting yah, took me close to 6mos to get our team to use it in a very limited manner
[19:23:07] <resting> zarac: lolâ€¦greatâ€¦i think we've reached a conclusion
[19:23:16] <LocalPCGuy> it= one of the MVC solutions
[19:23:35] <LocalPCGuy> zarac I thought we might be disagreeing about 2 different things
[19:23:40] <LocalPCGuy> ;)
[19:23:41] <zarac> In this case age / name / dob is not data. It's the attribute.
[19:23:50] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: Sorry. :0
[19:23:54] * zarac walks away in shame...
[19:24:01] <LocalPCGuy> no worries
[19:24:10] <LocalPCGuy> I have Scotch, I'm alllll good
[19:24:19] <zarac> : )
[19:24:19] <Guddu> Please help
[19:24:39] <resting> hm..ok now i'm curiousâ€¦care to provide an example of using the data- attributes? zarac?
[19:24:41] <LocalPCGuy> Guddu I don't know what "Please Help" is supposed to do, is there some code examples?
[19:24:54] <Guddu> Thanks LocalPCGuy I get an error when i try to show a modal dialog...Error is Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dialog'   and my code is http://dpaste.com/1021228/ Please help. I am calling the function as this showDialog('Load Validated Successfully');
[19:25:06] <zarac> resting: I'm working on zarac.se:3000 now. I use it there.
[19:25:26] <zarac> I also use class for selecting. ; )
[19:25:51] <resting> zarac: how do u differentiate between an attribute and a data?
[19:26:04] <zarac> resting: You can find a link to the source on the bottom of the page.
[19:26:09] <LocalPCGuy> btw, love data- attributes if I can't keep the data in memory
[19:26:41] <LocalPCGuy> Guddu and is dialog a plugin or is it the UI function?
[19:26:42] <zarac> data-foo is just an attribute, just like href is an attribute.
[19:27:06] <zarac> Me too. : )
[19:27:19] <LocalPCGuy> resting you could actually just add foobar as an attribute and all browsers would accept it
[19:27:25] <LocalPCGuy> but it doesn't validate
[19:27:29] * LocalPCGuy hsrugs
[19:27:33] * LocalPCGuy shrugs
[19:27:33] <b-ot> LocalPCGuy: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[19:27:53] <Guddu> LocalPCGuy, I was trying to make this one work http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-message
[19:28:22] <LocalPCGuy> guddu have you made sure you have all the code included (jquery ui library javascript and css)
[19:28:52] <Guddu> Oh my...I have only jquery-1.9.1.min.js included.
[19:29:01] <resting> zarac: are you using some templating system? you have those {id} syntax..
[19:29:12] <LocalPCGuy> that may be why dialog is undefined ;)
[19:29:39] <zarac> resting: Yes, dust.js.
[19:30:19] <zarac> resting: I really love dust.js. The creator hasn't maintained it for a while, but linkedin picked it up. I use their version.
[19:30:20] <resting> zarac: i see..looks cleanâ€¦hm..but i can't find your data- tags lol..
[19:30:22] <Guddu> LocalPCGuy, So i just need the jquery-ui.js right?
[19:30:39] <zarac> resting: Inspect any article.
[19:30:42] <LocalPCGuy> guddu ideally you would make a custom build that only includes the components you are using, but yes
[19:32:34] <zarac> resting: I usually put it in all my articles that have an id. And since i'm working on this right now is probably why i was a bit biased towards your question (and gave LocalPCGuy a hard time).
[19:33:23] <LocalPCGuy> seems like a logical use to me
[19:33:56] <resting> zarac: lolâ€¦hm..i see..you have data-id and number..hm..
[19:34:10] <zarac> Yeah, and when i think of it, it's probably one of the few instances when using attributes for selectors. ; )
[19:34:34] <zarac> resting: The number is the id of that record in the database (truth with a bit of modification).
[19:35:36] <zarac> resting: How do you select the tr, in your use case, to begin with?
[19:36:00] <zarac> Or are you not? Perhaps you're working on the whole set.. ?
[19:36:30] <LocalPCGuy> zarac the beautify of using a templating engine is that you don't have to select a specific element
[19:36:52] <LocalPCGuy> well...not to add text to it from your data JSON
[19:37:04] <zarac> : )
[19:37:11] <resting> zarac: hmâ€¦i have a div wrapping each table assigned with a different idâ€¦so i could get the table/tr/td which is a child of that div...
[19:37:54] <LocalPCGuy> dust.js looks interesting.  does it play well with things like knockout/backbone?
[19:37:59] <zarac> resting: Are there many of these divs?
[19:38:19] <resting> zarac: well..probably 10..not much
[19:38:25] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: I have no experience integrating them, but i see no reason why not.
[19:38:34] <zarac> resting: How do these id's look?
[19:39:07] <resting> zarac: just numbers lolâ€¦i'm using the id in the database as a id element...
[19:41:49] <zarac> resting: Then you have a potential bug, since the id attribute should be unique. E.g. The id of a blog post might be 45 and so might the id of a comment. There will be a collision in the case.
[19:42:29] <resting> zarac: erm..nopeâ€¦its a listing of example person..each person has  unique id..
[19:43:03] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: Do you know anything about the perforamce difference for selecting on attributes vs. the text?
[19:43:19] <coldhead> IDs aren't supposed to start with numbers anyway
[19:43:40] <LocalPCGuy> zarac hmm...seems like attributes would be better, but I try to avoid both.
[19:44:08] <LocalPCGuy> zarac interestingly enough, at jQueryTO Paul Irish said not to worry about selector performance, although not sure that applies if you still have to support IE7
[19:44:29] <resting> coldhead: yeaâ€¦hm...
[19:44:30] <zarac> resting: Yes, each person would have a unique id; but, if the id is not a guid there will be an issue if you're displaying another set of data that also has id's not being globally unique.
[19:44:55] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: I don't care about people not caring about not using IE7. ; )
[19:45:00] <resting> zarac: ah..i see your point...
[19:45:20] <LocalPCGuy> zarac I still have to support it for my current project :(
[19:45:27] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: I pity you. :&
[19:45:34] <zarac> .. or what you have to do. : )
[19:45:42] <zarac> Not you, per se. ; )
[19:45:44] <zarac> haha
[19:45:47] <zarac> how rude.
[19:45:57] <LocalPCGuy> 60000 visits a day, and their analytics show 3-5% IE7
[19:46:13] <coldhead> too many
[19:46:15] <zarac> That's scary.
[19:47:01] <LocalPCGuy> hoping it'll be lower by summer when it launches, but couldn't take the chance that we'd be turning away potentially 3000 people a day from being able to hand over $$
[19:47:05] <resting> yeaâ€¦the damage by microsoft still lurks...
[19:47:45] <limpc> hmm, html5's progress element is supposed to be supported by ie9, correct?
[19:48:33] <limpc> on ie9, it displays, but when calling $('#myprogress').val(int), the bar never updates
[19:48:39] <limpc> at least not visually
[19:50:13] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: Well, sometimes one just don't have the choice to do the right thing (not caring about IE7 users). ; )
[19:50:15] <resting> erm..any recommened site to reference full list of javascript functions?
[19:50:20] <LocalPCGuy> zarac test case for selectors data vs class vs text
[19:50:23] <LocalPCGuy> zarac http://jsperf.com/class-attribute-vs-data-attribute-selectors/6
[19:50:28] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: Thanks hat!
[19:51:40] <zarac> Neat, i imagined selecting on text'd be slow.
[19:52:01] <resting> LocalPCGuy: cool...
[19:52:09] <LocalPCGuy> yeah, I like jsperf
[19:52:26] <LocalPCGuy> of course, I tend to over-optimize the stuff that doesn't matter :P
[19:52:47] <resting> adding to bookmark lolâ€¦i'm like so outdated
[19:53:28] <zarac> I bookmarked it too! Thanks! : )
[19:53:50] <resting> the test doesn't expire right?
[19:53:58] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: May i ask what site it is you're working on/for?
[19:54:41] <LocalPCGuy> nope, the test doesn't expire as far as I know, I've got one's bookmarked from a long time ago
[19:54:58] <resting> erm..do you guys use this as reference? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference
[19:55:00] <LocalPCGuy> in fact a fav. google technique is to put jsperf X vs Y
[19:55:09] <LocalPCGuy> and see what others have already created
[19:55:15] <LocalPCGuy> yup resting
[19:55:41] <LocalPCGuy> zarac familiar with fast food businesses in the US?
[19:55:44] <resting> LocalPCGuy: thankâ€¦added into bookmark too then :)
[19:56:32] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: A bit, I lived in the states for a few yers.
[19:56:36] <zarac> s/yers/years
[19:57:35] <LocalPCGuy> zarac lets just say one of the bigger sub franchises that prides themselves on being freaky fast
[19:57:42] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: Are you a google employee?
[19:57:47] <LocalPCGuy> no
[19:57:55] <zarac> haha, ok : )
[19:57:59] <LocalPCGuy> just work for a digital agency
[19:58:04] <LocalPCGuy> doing front end work
[19:58:10] <zarac> Sweet. : )
[20:02:32] <zarac> So, $('*[class=toggler]') will give me the combined performance of selecting on class and attribute, right? ; )
[20:02:47] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[20:02:50] <zarac> Can't believe i wrote that. : )
[20:07:12] <resting> would http://script.aculo.us/ be a good complement with jquery?
[20:09:51] <BlaDe^> can anyone see what i've done wrong here? Console output is at the bottom.. I think the scope of my timer is wrong : http://pastie.org/private/ci7x3qixm2a4yuahic15rq
[20:10:02] <zarac> resting: You mean if they're compatible? They most likely are.
[20:10:47] <zarac> BlaDe^: What is unexpected?
[20:10:55] <zarac> Oh, nm.
[20:11:06] <BlaDe^> zarac:  the "off" is always constant.. I'm basically trying to bounce a pin and move it, but sometimes a pin is getting stuck bouncing
[20:11:39] <BlaDe^> i'd like to smoothly move it, but i can't even get this to work heh
[20:12:03] <resting> zarac: compatibility and to complement some features that jquery is missing. cause i think jquery is great a dom manipulation and stuffâ€¦but not that great at manipulation things like arrays, strings?
[20:12:25] <LocalPCGuy> resting I prefer underscore or the compatible lodash for those things
[20:12:32] <zarac> resting: You've got javascript to manipulate arrays and strings. : )
[20:13:14] <resting> zarac: yaâ€¦usually i use thatâ€¦but it could be cubersome somethings...
[20:13:25] <resting> LocalPCGuy: hmmâ€¦.i seeâ€¦will look at those
[20:13:52] <zarac> BlaDe^: Strange. Does it happen when you activate the bounce before the previous animation is done?
[20:15:14] <zarac> resting: :& .. perhaps I'm too n00b to have come across such issues. Got an example?
[20:15:18] <resting> from underscore site: "It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux". what does that mean?
[20:15:45] <zarac> resting: It means it's a good complement. ; )
[20:15:50] <BlaDe^> zarac:  possible
[20:16:02] <BlaDe^> zarac:  it could have many pins bouncing simultaneously, it needs to work in all cases
[20:16:06] <zarac> You should wear a tie if you're wearing a tuxedo.
[20:16:35] <resting> zarac: ermâ€¦actually not a big problemâ€¦cause remember i had the id as numbers problem? so i'm appending it with person-{id}â€¦so to get the id now requires a bit more work
[20:17:22] <resting> zarac: i seeâ€¦that thats good news
[20:18:19] <zarac> BlaDe^: All i can think of is, perhaps (i'm just guessing here), due to the animations being queued up (i think), the timeout is executed before the last animation is started.
[20:18:53] <resting> i always though underscore was a templating system..
[20:19:22] <zarac> resting: That should a trivial string concatenation.
[20:20:05] <LocalPCGuy> resting underscore/lodash give you helper functions that help filter arrays.  I really didn't need it until I was doing really heavy data-binding with models that I needed to filter their array or things like that.  And still not a "need", but it helped clean up my code
[20:20:21] <resting> zarac: yupâ€¦not a big problem
[20:20:28] <zarac> Those sorting methods could come quite handy. ; )
[20:20:28] <LocalPCGuy> resting it does more than just filter arrays, but that is an example of the types of functions provided
[20:20:40] <zarac> Not sure if i'd use a whole library for such a thing though.
[20:20:59] <LocalPCGuy> zarac I think that's where lodash comes in - similar functionality but smaller
[20:21:16] <LocalPCGuy> and underscore does include templating as well
[20:21:29] <resting> LocalPCGuy: thanksâ€¦i think those are really great complement to jquery...
[20:22:01] <LocalPCGuy> underscore also gives you some of the functions newer browsers already have but old ones do not, and using the browser's native function if it exists
[20:22:17] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: I'll check it out. ; )
[20:23:12] <resting> thanks to those awesome people developing tools to make our lives easier
[20:23:28] <zarac> resting: It's nature in action. ; )
[20:23:41] <resting> lol...nature?
[20:23:50] <zarac> Yes. ; )
[20:23:56] <zarac> Thank the Universe, we're all the universe. ; )
[20:24:00] <Max-P> Hi, I have some trouble swapping two divs in a jQuery droppable handler. Basically, both divs are draggable and droppable (they are containers), and on the drop event, I call a function that swaps the content of the two divs. The function works fine when triggered manually, but divs are duplicating when done from the drop() handler. Any pointer?
[20:24:12] <resting> lolâ€¦yea...
[20:24:57] <LocalPCGuy> Max-P I can't say I'm 100% proud of this code (wrote most of it over a year ago) but I did something extremely similar on yearlyme.com
[20:26:10] <BlaDe^> zarac:  i found the issue
[20:26:16] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: Have you got experience with drag-and-drop for touch-screens? What's the state of it?
[20:26:30] <zarac> BlaDe^: Congratulations! What was it? : )
[20:26:40] <BlaDe^> zarac:  well we're half way ;) i don't know how to fix it
[20:26:42] <LocalPCGuy> zarac the updated version of draggable/droppable will support touch
[20:26:49] <LocalPCGuy> zarac not sure when they will land though
[20:27:07] <BlaDe^> zarac:  http://pastie.org/private/xunag8n7iprmalpvsm0hig
[20:27:30] <LocalPCGuy> zarac we decided for yearlyme.com touch was not supported for drag/drop since it was an alternate use case anyways
[20:27:33] <BlaDe^> zarac: if two pins are bounced at once then then because the 'marker' in scope is always the last one, the timer calls the last one N times
[20:27:49] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: Cool. ; )
[20:27:57] <Max-P> zarac, I had a plugin that made it work (a script that converts touch actions to mouse actions). It worked, but laggy as hell. Mobile browsers are not capable of rendering something usable (was 2-3 FPS). On a PC it should work nice thought
[20:28:45] <zarac> BlaDe^: Great work. :)
[20:29:09] <LocalPCGuy> zarac FWIW at the jQueryTO conference, they said there are only 4 more widgets to complete (including draggable/droppable) and then jquery UI would be fully touch aware/usable
[20:29:29] <zarac> Max-P: Ah. Well let's hope some genius comes up with a universal solution soon. ; )
[20:29:52] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: Awesome! : )
[20:30:17] <LocalPCGuy> might make me actually use it more, I tend to shy away due to the overall size
[20:30:56] <Max-P> Ok, as for my problem, I think I understand what's going on. Is it possible to tell jQuery to NOT touch the original draggable at all? Even with helper: 'clone', it manages to somehow mess it around a lot...
[20:31:08] <zarac> BlaDe^: What is setAnimation?
[20:31:23] <zarac> BlaDe^: As in, where does the function come from? js / jquery / your own?
[20:31:51] <BlaDe^> zarac:  it's a gmap function -- but the solution was to wrap it in a closure
[20:32:17] <zarac> BlaDe^: Ah. : )
[20:33:15] <zarac> BlaDe^: Perhaps setAnimation accepts a duration .. ?
[20:33:59] <BlaDe^> zarac:  negative, it's because marker has a global scope so gets overwritten.. if 2 timers are running concurrently they both read the same variable
[20:34:02] <BlaDe^> setTimeout((function (marker) { return function () { marker.setAnimation(null); }; })(marker), 500);
[20:34:17] <BlaDe^> wrapping it in a closure allows me to redefine marker in a local scope to avoid it getting overwritten if another timer gets spun up
[20:35:11] <zarac> BlaDe^: Sounds like you've got it under control. ; )
[20:39:13] <vinex08> hi, how can i autofit the the font size depending on the divs height and width , something like autoshrink?
[20:39:43] <LocalPCGuy> vinex08 fittext.js
[20:39:49] <LocalPCGuy> I think
[20:40:12] <vinex08> Ok ill go check it out
[20:40:14] <Max-P> Well, I got it working. Draggable is {revert: true, revertDuration: 0, helper: 'original'}. That way, everything seems to be placed back where it was correctly. It doesn't work with helper: clone for some reasons, but I will leave it as it is right now. jQuery annoys me more and more, wish there was an "Non intrusive" option for it :/
[20:40:19] <LocalPCGuy> vinex08 http://fittextjs.com/
[20:40:25] <LocalPCGuy> there is another similar one as well
[20:41:15] <vinex08> http://letteringjs.com/
[20:42:21] <LocalPCGuy> vinex08 yah, I think fittext.js is more specific to what you were asking whereas lettering.js is a more general typography plugin
[20:43:10] <LocalPCGuy> Max-P helper: clone seems like it would clone the node, which is what you didn't want, right?
[20:43:56] <zarac> LocalPCGuy: You're supplying me with all kinds of neat js libraries. : )
[20:44:18] <LocalPCGuy> heh...if only I could remember which ones I liked and which were absolute crap
[20:44:48] <LocalPCGuy> seriously though, I think I liked most of the ones I posted so far tonight
[20:45:51] <zarac> : )
[20:46:02] <Max-P> LocalPCGuy, Yes and no. I wanted to have the helper so I can freely move the helper around, but I want it to be trashed away once it's done moving and keep only the original element (so the original element visually stays where it was, while having a copy of it for the look of the dragging)
[20:46:22] <LocalPCGuy> ah, ok.
[20:46:39] <LocalPCGuy> I think I used the revert for that, and actually moved the original element
[20:47:01] <LocalPCGuy> if it wasn't in an acceptable droppable I just let it animate back to the original position
[20:47:40] <Max-P> LocalPCGuy, But even with revert: true, it did funny things, like the helper being appended to the original div and the original div moved to its correct position, ending in duplicates
[20:47:55] <LocalPCGuy> weird
[20:48:17] <Max-P> LocalPCGuy, I expected the helper to be trashed right away when done, so I could work with the original div properly, but I end up with the copy being appended somewhere, that's really weird
[20:48:34] <LocalPCGuy> of course, I wrote my own function to do the swap in the DOM
[20:48:35] <Max-P> Anyway, I got it working now, I'm totally not touching it again
[20:48:42] <LocalPCGuy> I understand that
[20:49:05] <Max-P> Yup, did the same, I manually .detach both divs and append them back to the appropriate containers
[21:00:17] <Guddu> LocalPCGuy, Thanks...after including proper libraries and CSS my modal form started working fine.
[21:00:26] <LocalPCGuy> nice!
[21:00:38] <Guddu> Dear JQuery folks...I am removing a HTML element using $("#module").detach() or $("#module").remove() calls. The element (which is a form in this case) disappears from the screen but when i do a view source, I can see still in in the code. What is the idea behind this? Am i doing something wrong?
[21:02:08] <brianseeders> view source shows the original HTML as it was loaded from the server, before javascript manipulated it
[21:03:00] <Max-P> Guddu, are you looking at the source-code or the current DOM in a web console? As brianseeders said, the source-code window displays the original code downloaded by the browser, not the actual state of the DOM.
[21:03:59] <brianseeders> whatever browser you are using should have a separate developer tool for viewing the live state of the elements on the page (the DOM that Max-P just mentioned)
[21:04:21] <Guddu> Max-P, brianseeders I was looking at View Source....Not the web console....But i realized now that if i see webconsole i get to see the current state :-) Thanks
[21:21:10] <Suppa_Spic> hi guys, what's the new method to click on appended elements (I see live is deprecated)
[21:21:55] <Suppa_Spic> I'm using on with click, but doesnt work as expected (on anchors)
[21:22:52] <LocalPCGuy> .on(
[21:24:11] <Suppa_Spic> yeah, the problem is, when I click on an anchor, it reloads the page (ignoring the preventdefault())
[21:24:49] <grafi> show some code
[21:25:02] <Suppa_Spic> alright
[21:26:16] <Suppa_Spic> http://pastebin.com/y7byqsHU
[21:26:44] <Suppa_Spic> I'm not using a delegate (tried it and works the same)
[21:27:49] <macbleser_> Hi All - I'm hoping someone could help me come up with a performant way to run a $(window).scroll function inside an if statement based on $(window).width();
[21:28:05] <LocalPCGuy> suppa_spic is .report-comment in the dom or added later?
[21:28:31] <Suppa_Spic> LocalPCGuy: some are already in the dom, the problem is click on new added elements (appended)
[21:28:39] <coldhead> s/performant/efficient/
[21:28:40] <Suppa_Spic> the ones that are already in the dom work fine
[21:29:07] <LocalPCGuy> suppa_spic right.  So you need to use .on through a delegate, so if there is a container element that holds all of the .report-comment, just reference that:
[21:29:26] <LocalPCGuy> $('.container').on('click', '.report-comment', function(e) { ...
[21:29:42] <LocalPCGuy> suppa_spic make sense?
[21:29:45] <Suppa_Spic> alright, lemme try that again (iirc I already tried it) but let's see
[21:29:46] <Suppa_Spic> yes
[21:30:20] <Suppa_Spic> LocalPCGuy: does it need to be the nearest parent element?
[21:30:47] <LocalPCGuy> suppa_spic nope, it could be all the way up on the body, although I would find the closest container that contains all of the elements you want to watch for
[21:30:58] <Suppa_Spic> alright
[21:30:58] <Suppa_Spic> ty
[21:31:52] <Suppa_Spic> hmm nothing :/
[21:31:53] <Suppa_Spic> http://pastebin.com/S7gpY8fk
[21:32:23] <Suppa_Spic> the other elements work fine, but not the element just added to the DOM :/
[21:33:55] <LocalPCGuy> suppa_spic just for testing sake, go ahead and make the first one $('body')
[21:34:01] <grafi> and comment-single has multiple .report-comment's ?
[21:34:01] <Suppa_Spic> alright
[21:34:13] <Suppa_Spic> nope, only one
[21:34:20] <LocalPCGuy> suppa_spic I don't think you are moving it "up" far enough
[21:34:33] <LocalPCGuy> suppa_spic but would help if you also showed the  HTML
[21:34:40] <grafi> probably
[21:35:01] <Suppa_Spic> sure, lets see what I can paste
[21:35:38] <Suppa_Spic> welp, 'body' worked
[21:35:43] <macbleser_> In the meantime, here is a sample of what I am trying to do based on my question above. http://jsfiddle.net/macbleser/YMERz/
[21:35:59] <Suppa_Spic> seems like comment single was part of the new added element
[21:36:04] <Suppa_Spic> silly me :P
[21:36:08] <grafi> :P
[21:36:10] <LocalPCGuy> yup, that was what I figured
[21:36:23] <Suppa_Spic> ty anyway :)
[21:36:49] <LocalPCGuy> suppa_spic so just find the container that those get added to that is always in the DOM and you should be good (don't leave it on body, that was just for testing)
[21:37:06] <Suppa_Spic> yes :)
[21:37:14] <LocalPCGuy> cool, gkl
[21:37:19] <LocalPCGuy> err gl
[21:37:22] <Max-P> macbleser_, The problem you get is probably because you are binding a whole bunch of .scroll() handlers at each resize.
[21:38:28] <nesoi> hey so in jquery mobile, if I want the height of the current page's header or footer, what's the correct syntax? I have $('[data-role="header"]').first().outerHeight(); and it's returning zero
[21:39:14] <macbleser_> Max-P, should I use timeout or delay or something?
[21:39:56] <Max-P> macbleser_, I'd do something like $(window).off('scroll.custom'); $(window).on('scroll', function() { /* Your function here */) }
[21:40:27] <Max-P> Oops, .on('scroll.custom', ...
[21:41:16] <Max-P> That way, you unbind the existing handler, and sets a new one. The problem with your way, is that if the browser is resized 100 times (like, about 10 per second while resizing), you end up having 100 bound functions on the scroll event, each executing in turn.
[21:43:11] <macbleser_> Interesting. I give that approach a try.
[21:44:15] <macbleser_> I'll*
[21:44:56] <zarac> I'm *.
[21:44:57] <zarac> : )
[21:52:52] <macbleser_> Max-P, that definitely works better on page load but it doesn't seem to be executing $(window).resize(browserSizeActions); if I resize my window.
[21:53:03] <coldhead> kiss amazed
[21:53:54] <RandalSchwartz> isn't on .on('resize', ...)
[21:54:26] <RandalSchwartz> oh - shortcut
[21:57:26] <macbleser_> Updated jsfiddle with the .on and .off. Not sure where to run .resize now..
[21:57:27] <macbleser_> http://jsfiddle.net/macbleser/YMERz/1/
[21:59:09] <Max-P> macbleser_, It works just fine in your jsfiddle, I added an alert to see if it's being called and it works
[21:59:50] <Max-P> I'd move the $(window).off outside of the if.
[22:00:17] <Max-P> Currently, if you resize your window smaller then 767, .off is not called so your function is still called
[22:00:34] <BillCriswell> macbleser_: Instead of doing foo; $(window).resize(foo); you can do $(window).on('resize', foo).trigger('resize');
[22:03:33] <macbleser_> Thanks BillCriswell
[22:03:53] <macbleser_> Max-P, should it be in the else then?
[22:04:39] <macbleser_> (sorry I am still a noob in this dept.)
[22:04:47] <Max-P> macbleser_, No, you have to unbind it either way. I'll update the fiddle
[22:07:54] <Max-P> macbleser_, http://jsfiddle.net/YMERz/3/
[22:09:23] <macbleser_> Max-P, thanks a ton. giving that a try now.
[22:20:27] <macbleser_> Max-P, so it works brilliantly after resize now but it doesn't seem to add the class on page load.
[22:21:25] <BillCriswell> I'm watching Ren and Stimpy.. no wonder why I turned into such a weird adult.
[22:21:28] <Max-P> macbleser_, The navbar-fixed-top one?
[22:21:36] <macbleser_> Yes
[22:21:54] <meoooww> hi guys what's your favourite channel on freenode ?
[22:22:38] <BillCriswell> meoooww: This channel is pretty awesome the majority of the time.
[22:23:14] <meoooww> then some channel else that is cool ?
[22:23:19] <Max-P> macbleser_, Only one page load, or it doesn't get applied at all? Because on page load, scrollPosition is 0, so the class is not applied (the scroll handler is not called too, because the page haven't scrolled)
[22:23:24] <Max-P> meoooww, #archlinux
[22:23:47] <BillCriswell> Dudes in #angularjs seem nice so far.
[22:24:00] <BillCriswell> #javascript is usually pretty great.
[22:24:09] <meoooww> thanks
[22:25:49] <Max-P> meoooww, What are you looking for exactly? Lots of channels on freenode are dedicated to some softwares or languages in general. I mean, if you ask a Windows question on #ubuntu, that won't work. You looking for a simple chat or anything?
[22:25:59] <macbleser_> Max-P, If you load the page and then scroll (without resizing window) it doesn't add the class. If you load the page, resize it, then scroll it then adds the class.
[22:26:27] <meoooww> but some other channel, around such electronics, animals, comics, musics, etc
[22:26:59] <zarac> Max-P: Yay for #archlinux . ;)
[22:27:21] <BillCriswell> macbleser_: What if you do just .trigger('resize') instead of .trigger('resize.custom')
[22:28:04] <Max-P> macbleser_, use console.log to check the window size. My guess is that the size might be 0 (not calculated yet), so the scroll handler is not bound. That way you will have a good list of exactly what is called when and with each values.
[22:28:06] <BillCriswell> meoooww: I only use IRC for developer talk cause I have no friends who do it. =)
[22:28:19] <Max-P> or just set breakpoints the the script editor
[22:28:32] <zarac> meoooww: What's your mission?
[22:28:39] <macbleser_> I tried Bill's suggestion and that seemed to work.
[22:28:55] <Max-P> Lol hi zarac ;)
[22:29:01] <zarac> =D
[22:30:09] <Max-P> macbleser_, Oh, it's my fault. resize.custom does not exist because I bound it with .resize(). My bad. Indeed, you need to either give it a name or just resize (but without a name, you possibly call any other .resize() bound to the document)
[22:31:04] <Max-P> zarac, I'm not on IRC very often, I mostly log in when I have some crazy weird problems that I can't solve myself, and it's pretty rare ;)
[22:31:48] <Max-P> and arch is the default channel in XChat and I like to see people talk while I wait on any other support channel (#jquery tonight with a weird draggable/droppable bug)
[22:31:52] <B|aster> hey guys, if I have  var elem = $('<option>Hello</option>').prop('selected','selected');  how can I append that to $(document).find('select').   ?
[22:32:22] <macbleser_> No problem Max-P. Thanks for all the help!
[22:32:36] <Max-P> B|aster, $(document).find('select').append(elem) ?
[22:32:42] <macbleser_> Thank you BillCriswell as well!
[22:32:56] <BillCriswell> No problemmooooo
[22:33:03] <RigidWig> why would $('body').html('<p>blah</p>') return "TypeError: Object #<HTMLBodyElement> has no method 'html'" ?
[22:33:31] <B|aster> Max-P:  That doesn't work.
[22:34:24] <Max-P> B|aster, I remember having troubles with find(), are you sure .find() returns what you expect it to? console.log() it to check it out
[22:34:34] <meoooww> hey, much of the front end of web part I read doesn't have a rigorous mathematics model
[22:34:35] <zarac> Max-P: Are you on arch linux?
[22:35:07] <Max-P> zarac, Of course, why would the package use #archlinux by then? ;)
[22:35:24] <zarac> Max-P: That would've been my question too. ; )
[22:35:29] <B|aster> Max-P:  Any idea why the element added doesn't have a selected attribute? http://jsfiddle.net/xzudr/
[22:35:33] <meoooww> I see an image that marked archlinux as "evil" today .
[22:35:38] <BillCriswell> RigidWig: Hmm...
[22:35:59] <RigidWig> BillCriswell, I share your pondering....
[22:36:38] <BillCriswell> RigidWig: you wrapping it on a doc ready?
[22:36:55] <RigidWig> BillCriswell, aha!, said the fool (me), typo in script source line... such is life.
[22:37:04] <RigidWig> BillCriswell, thanks though
[22:37:21] <BillCriswell> RigidWig: Yeah, it didn't occur to me at first either haha.
[22:37:58] <meoooww> whoo tiny url , with user js content
[22:39:19] <meoooww> I made a simple tiny url java servlet several days before.
[22:39:29] <Max-P> B|aster, seems to work with .attr('selected', 'selected'), don't know why it doesn't with .prop()
[22:40:06] <zarac> Max-P: It would've been neat of the xchat folks were such fans of #archlinux to make it the default channel.
[22:40:20] <meoooww> by the way, what's your local time now ?
[22:40:41] <danheberden> B|aster: you don't select the option programtically
[22:40:42] <zarac> 0
[22:41:09] <danheberden> the option can have an `attr` of selected when added, which the DOM will parse into the proper selectedIndex for the select element
[22:41:41] <BillCriswell> 1:41am!
[22:41:57] <danheberden> i don't think i said that all correctly, but you probably get the idea
[22:42:02] <meoooww> BillCriswell, so as I
[22:42:19] <tw2113> i forgive you dan
[22:42:35] <aniasis> Hey how can detect my user agent?
[22:42:36] <b1lly> https://github.com/b1lly/syncDropdowns
[22:42:37] <b1lly> pew pew
[22:42:38] <BillCriswell> meoooww: Damn Ren & Stimpy are keeping me up.
[22:42:46] <tw2113> it's log!
[22:42:53] <coldhead> squeak i tell you, squeak!
[22:43:05] <tw2113> *squeaks*
[22:43:24] <BillCriswell> "No sir. I don't like it"
[22:43:27] <meoooww> user agent.. some BOM method could read it , then use regex to parse the string
[22:44:02] <tw2113> BillCriswell, are you secretly Powdered Toast Man?
[22:44:15] <BillCriswell> Wish I had a butt like that.
[22:45:09] <meoooww> powder ? toast ?
[22:45:18] <Max-P> aniasis, window.navigator contains a few informations, window.navigator.appVersion contains the User-Agend string as sent in the HTTP headers
[22:45:43] <tw2113> meoooww, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powdered_toast_man#Powdered_Toast_Man
[22:45:54] <Max-P> Since UA are a plain mess, you have no choice other than searching with a regex for Chrome/xxx, Safari/xxx, MSIE, Firefox, and others
[22:46:11] <Max-P> Only Opera does it right, sending Opera/Version as a user-agent.
[22:46:32] <RandalSchwartz> everyone wants to pretend to be someone else :)
[22:46:52] <tw2113> why are we UA sniffing again?
[22:47:01] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, that's the wrong approach
[22:47:07] <RandalSchwartz> should be looking at capabilities
[22:47:16] <RandalSchwartz> which jq already does for us, mostly
[22:47:55] <meoooww> besides, how to read the jquery version
[22:47:56] <Max-P> tw2113, Because someone asked, but indeed probing for capabilities is much better. But it might be legit, like displaying the browser name and versions for other things, like stats or whatever. BEtter suited on server-side thought.
[22:48:04] <BillCriswell> meoooww: $.fn.jquery
[22:48:21] <meoooww> OK
[22:49:51] <tw2113> best next step: ask their intentions, unless this is for some plugin that you're crafting for potential uses
[22:49:53] <Max-P> meoooww, Why would you want that anyway? If you insert the script in your page, you already know its version (unless it's an old site you just joined). But even then, you can also just open the source file and take the version from the only comment header there.
[22:51:36] <meoooww> ohh comment header .. sometimes I want to hach some site within the console , and jquery acts wired
[22:51:57] <meoooww> weird
[22:52:41] <BillCriswell> If I sent a UA string... It would be... "AwesomeBill/28.0 (OSX) Boop"
[22:52:55] <BillCriswell> Boop is really fun to say.
[22:53:01] <danheberden> this is true
[22:53:07] <meoooww> or HandsomeBill/28.0 ?
[22:53:23] <danheberden> pssh what about BeautifulBill/28.0
[22:53:40] <BillCriswell> These are all valid.
[22:53:41] <xybrek> i'm trying to create a single-page website, however I need templating (client-side) what are the options?
[22:53:49] <tw2113> BuffaloBill/28.0
[22:53:56] <danheberden> xybrek: like, 20 popular templating libraries
[22:53:58] <BillCriswell> tw2113: I'd fuck me.
[22:54:05] <danheberden> xybrek: check out mustache
[22:54:09] <danheberden> or handlebars
[22:54:13] <tw2113> remind me not to shake your hand BillCriswell
[22:54:14] <danheberden> (i use handlebars)
[22:54:28] <danheberden> tw2113: you say that now...
[22:54:35] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Silence Of The Lambs was awesome.
[22:54:57] <xybrek> mustache, does it need a backend of something, coz I saw some javascript templating but it needs some backend
[22:55:07] <tw2113> danheberden, handlebars? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLUX0y4EptA
[22:55:29] <danheberden> xybrek: depends if you like having a build process that builds them as a JST or such for you
[22:55:31] <danheberden> (which i recommend)
[22:55:46] <danheberden> xybrek: but you can just do it the old fashioned way too
[22:56:19] <danheberden> xybrek: <script id="template-whatever" type="text/x-handlebars">ALL YOUR<b>{{whatever}}</b>handlebars bullshit</script>
[22:56:23] <aniasis> How can I detect my browser?
[22:56:29] <xybrek> danheberden: nope, i am deploying in a cms, so basically, html can only access resources
[22:56:32] <danheberden> aniasis: it's not the spoon that bends
[22:56:44] <b1lly> nothing like alate night hacksess
[22:56:55] <danheberden> xybrek: cms's have been known to be scriptable, but either way, you have options
[22:56:58] <danheberden> as i pointed out
[22:57:04] <Max-P> aniasis, Already replied to this question. What are you trying to do?
[22:58:02] <danheberden> aniasis: it's like, you're asking what house you're in to find out where the bathroom is; just check the rooms for a bathroom
[23:00:11] <meoooww> did you use the fake link , like  http://someurl#!focusone ? that stays in the same html page in fact, and doing ajax communication when forward or backward
[23:00:30] <BillCriswell> Night dudes.
[23:00:46] <danheberden> i'll love you forever BillCriswell
[23:00:53] <Max-P> BillBlue, 'night
[23:00:57] <meoooww> good night
[23:00:58] <coldhead> if that even IS his real name
[23:01:10] <danheberden> inorite
[23:01:14] <Max-P> oops, wrong tab name
[23:01:16] <Max-P> crap.
[23:01:27] <coldhead> sorry BillBlue
[23:01:38] <danheberden> BillBlue: if you have a question, Max-P would love to answer it
[23:01:44] <Max-P> xD
[23:01:46] <coldhead> BillBlue: please ignore all these mentions
[23:01:55] <meoooww> ;)
[23:01:56] <danheberden> except the one that coldhead just made
[23:02:01] <meoooww> :]
[23:02:03] <coldhead> especially that one
[23:02:07] <Max-P> Yeah, lets mention him again and again just to make sure he gets it
[23:02:08] <coldhead> IGNORE THAT ONE THE MOST, BILLBLUE
[23:02:17] <meoooww> :-o
[23:02:21] <coldhead> who you talkin about, Max-P?
[23:02:25] <coldhead> you talking about BillBlue ?
[23:02:37] <danheberden> ok, BillBlue, ban 'em
[23:02:42] <tw2113> all my life coldy
[23:02:52] <coldhead> how drunk is dan zomg
[23:02:52] <tw2113> whatchu gonna do brotha?
[23:03:10] <danheberden> coldhead: wat u mean
[23:03:11] <Max-P> What the hell happened with the chanserv? o_O
[23:03:33] <coldhead> JUST DO NOT EVEN START WITH ME HEBERDEN
[23:03:33] <Max-P> yay lets zline everyone!
[23:03:41] <coldhead> GO BACK TO YOUR COIN MUSEUM
[23:03:43] <meoooww> ^_^
[23:03:48] <danheberden> coldhead: aww, you remembered
[23:03:56] <coldhead> eryday
[23:04:04] <danheberden> you are truly one of my favorites coldhead
[23:04:05] <tw2113> *shufflin*
[23:04:05] <Max-P> Oh, so dan is an op. Now I get it.
[23:04:15] <danheberden> Max-P: chanserv said YOU were
[23:04:20] <danheberden> i thought you were the one doing that
[23:04:24] <tw2113> clearly I am
[23:04:27] * meoooww ?
[23:04:29] <tw2113> *kicks everyone in the shin*
[23:04:32] <danheberden> that makes sense, tw2113 is in here a lot
[23:04:53] <meoooww> hey, do you guys play the game, Resident Evil ?
[23:05:02] <Max-P> danheberden, "-ChanServ- You have been opped on #jquery by danheberden" yeah, you clearly didn't do anything ;)
[23:05:02] <tw2113> i give up social life for you people
[23:05:04] <meoooww> or Starcraft II ?
[23:05:07] <tw2113> not really, but you know
[23:05:12] <tw2113> you ARE my social life people
[23:05:32] <coldhead> good evening, welcome to smart bar
[23:05:49] <meoooww> good afternoon anyway
[23:05:52] <danheberden> Max-P: ChanServ and it's whorish fucking mouth
[23:06:29] <meoooww> hey do you guys practice Ch'an ?
[23:06:42] <coldhead> i do meoooww
[23:06:50] <coldhead> dhyana and all that
[23:07:31] <meoooww> just mention about
[23:08:13] <coldhead> quite.
[23:10:12] <meoooww> I met a guy from Mount Song, who likes buddhism very much
[23:11:35] <coldhead> i hope he doesn't get too attached to it or he'll suffer
[23:11:37] <coldhead> AHAHAHAHAHAHA
[23:11:55] <coldhead> little four noble truths joke there
[23:12:01] <coldhead> is this thing on?
[23:12:03] <coldhead> guys?
[23:12:21] <meoooww> and tai chi ..
[23:12:21] <grafi> you are solid gold coldhead
[23:13:01] <meoooww> tai ~ chi ~ ch'an
[23:13:51] <danheberden> coldhead: quite funny sir
[23:13:57] <danheberden> i should set a highlight trigger for your name
[23:14:00] <danheberden> so i don't miss such tings
[23:14:03] <danheberden> *things
[23:14:56] <guzzlefry> hello
[23:15:29] <coldhead> i can just mention you at the end of every line, danheberden
[23:15:35] <coldhead> it's no problem, danheberden
[23:15:42] <coldhead> i'll get a macro to do it danheberden
[23:15:52] <coldhead> i can also email you a daily digest
[23:15:55] <guzzlefry> I have a JQuery object. I want to find out which index corresponds to it within a set of matched objects.
[23:15:56] <coldhead> danheberden: ^
[23:16:09] <meoooww> and do you guys know  web.qq.com  ?
[23:16:10] <Max-P> That sounds like a really good idea, coldhead, danheberden
[23:16:11] <guzzlefry> matched elements, rather >_>
[23:16:31] <meoooww> the design is like in OS GUI
[23:16:50] <danheberden> guzzlefry: i'll let you guess what that method would be called
[23:16:55] <danheberden> YOU ONLY GET ONE GUESS
[23:17:42] <guzzlefry> *sigh*
[23:17:58] <danheberden> guzzlefry: that's not even a valid javascript variable name
[23:18:09] <guzzlefry> no, that's my reaction to feeling dumb. :P
[23:18:13] <coldhead> indexOfSameObject ?
[23:18:19] <guzzlefry> .index() is the answer
[23:18:25] <danheberden> ahha!
[23:18:28] <danheberden> ?index @ guzzlefry
[23:18:29] <bot-t> guzzlefry, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[23:18:33] <coldhead> then what the hell am i using
[23:18:34] <Max-P> guzzlefry, don't worry about that. He has been like that for an hour or so.
[23:18:49] <danheberden> coldhead: i like it - it has a certain sexiness about it
[23:18:56] <danheberden> Max-P: ENOUGH OUT OF Y
[23:19:16] <danheberden> whew - THAT GUY
[23:19:20] <danheberden> i mean, goodness
[23:20:08] <Max-P> I seriously never laughed so much on IRC, thanks danheberden xD
[23:20:18] <danheberden> Max-P: 'tis what i'm here for :)
[23:20:30] <danheberden> and, to be serious Max-P
[23:20:45] <danheberden> i like leading people to answers, even if being silly
[23:20:45] <coldhead> yahoo serious?
[23:21:05] <danheberden> i feel it helps lower the seriousness and inherent "omg this is too much and complicated" feelings
[23:21:16] <danheberden> when it's like "Whatever, it's just javascript 'n shit"
[23:21:28] <tw2113> surely you can't be serious?
[23:21:43] <danheberden> tw2113: i am, and don't call me Sherly
[23:21:52] <tw2113> you're yahoo serious?
[23:21:54] <tw2113> whoa
[23:21:54] <Max-P> danheberden, Yeah, that's good too ^^ But I felt this one wasn't pretty unwelcoming, I'd have felt like an idiot
[23:21:57] <guzzlefry> Are there any good articles on coding style for JQuery?
[23:22:10] <danheberden> Max-P: well, i mean, i'm still a dick in the end
[23:22:23] <coldhead> guzzlefry: https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js/
[23:22:24] <guzzlefry> The book I'm using just uses 8 billion nested brackets, parenthesis, etc. :P
[23:22:40] <coldhead> the good thing about that one is if you use it, rwaldron won't beat you senseless
[23:22:44] <coldhead> (probably)
[23:22:46] <danheberden> also, guzzlefry, you might find this interesting http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/
[23:23:18] <danheberden> guzzlefry: one thing, too, that helps is to just look at projects from others in the javascript community
[23:23:35] <guzzlefry> will do, thank you!
[23:23:47] <tw2113> remember guzzlefry be wary but not nitpicky about file size in unminified copies
[23:23:57] <tw2113> save the pickiness for the minification
[23:24:01] <danheberden> tw2113: thanks for the RT - that tweet is getting some good traction for, like, midnight+
[23:24:29] <danheberden> also, guzzlefry, you switch to coffeescript, comma first, or optional semicolons and I WILL FIND YOU
[23:24:46] * tw2113 would agree with danheberden but then we'd both be wrong.
[23:25:02] <guzzlefry> comma first?
[23:25:03] <danheberden> i.. i don't even know what you mean tw2113
[23:25:07] <tw2113> :D
[23:25:09] <tw2113> jk
[23:25:11] <danheberden> guzzlefry: a horrid thing
[23:25:16] <guzzlefry> what is it?
[23:25:27] <danheberden> imagine putting the commas first on the NEXT line, instead of at the end of the current
[23:25:42] <guzzlefry> I don't do the other two things. Learning C and friends first makes semi-colons mandatory. I even try them in VB.NET. :P
[23:26:01] <danheberden> guzzlefry: glad to hear you're getting in to javascript!
[23:26:07] <guzzlefry> danheberden: you should be going door-to-door checking for that! :P
[23:26:21] <danheberden> guzzlefry: i practically do!
[23:26:24] <danheberden> well, not really
[23:26:28] <danheberden> i just poke fun in my talks
[23:26:29] <tw2113> coldhead, danheberden, this one time, i met this girl at a webdev conference thing that was put on, and i swore she was "the one". But then I looked at her github profile...she puts her opening brackets on a new line after function declarations...
[23:26:35] <tw2113> she...wasn't "the one"
[23:26:46] <danheberden> tw2113: haha
[23:26:52] <Max-P> tw2113, LOL (and I agreee)
[23:26:58] <coldhead> people can change, tw2113
[23:27:03] <coldhead> it all minifies the same
[23:27:09] <tw2113> not this one coldhead
[23:27:10] <danheberden> i, too, used to put my brackets on the line below
[23:27:14] <danheberden> but i was so young then
[23:27:17] <tw2113> mostly because i woke up and it was all a dream
[23:27:29] <tw2113> fucking mind
[23:27:45] <guzzlefry> brackets on a new line after the function declaration was a standard thing in C >_>
[23:27:58] <Max-P> There are many standards in C
[23:27:58] <tw2113> mental note...don't learn C
[23:28:25] <Max-P> But putting a single { on the next line is such a waste of space
[23:28:35] <tw2113> oops, i break the jQuery style guide for quotes
[23:28:37] <guzzlefry> yeah, why I don't typically do that.
[23:28:42] <tw2113> i prefer single quote on the outside
[23:28:46] <guzzlefry> Unless I'm trying to conform to PEAR styling.
[23:29:06] <Max-P> If I want spacing I put an extra line instead
[23:29:14] <Batdorf> I want to make my script available in custom builds. For example, when you download jQuery, you can leave out certain parts you don't need. Is there a tool to serve up custom builds? My code is already separated into modules
[23:29:49] <Max-P> BUT, the GNU C convention is definitely the worse. if ( condition ) \n two spaces, bracket, \n, four spaces, content. That's. Wow.
[23:30:27] <guzzlefry> does anyone actually do that? 0.o
[23:30:49] <Max-P> Batdorf, just store each of them seperately, and concatenate each modules you want to supply at the end to make one large minified file. Does this help a bit?
[23:30:49] <tw2113> i have no problem with space around stuff in ()'s
[23:30:57] <tw2113> but i do a lot more PHP than js
[23:31:20] <coldhead> sucks to be you
[23:31:32] <Batdorf> What would I use to concatenate and minify server side? Can grunt run server side like this?
[23:33:28] <Max-P> Batdorf, Well, anything you want. Every server-side language have a way to add multiple strings together and serve it. In PHP it would look like if(isset($_REQUEST['want_module_A'])) readfile('module_A.min.js'); if(isset($_REQUEST['want_module_B'])) readfile('module_B.js')
[23:33:37] <Max-P> something like that
[23:33:49] <Max-P> it can even be made client-side with the file API

[23:34:50] <Batdorf> Interesting, I don't know much about php. Do you think it's the best language for this?
[23:35:16] <tw2113> eh? php for minification and whatnot?
[23:35:28] <tw2113> oh, i read up
[23:35:29] <tw2113> nevermind
[23:35:31] <Max-P> Batdorf, depends on what you have available, mostly. There are hundreds of ways to do that, be creative
[23:35:36] <Batdorf> I guess I could minify it beforehand
[23:35:52] <tw2113> i wish my minification plugins worked right now in sublime text
[23:35:53] <Max-P> Yes, better minify it beforehand
[23:36:18] <Batdorf> cool, ill look into getting it done with php, thanks
[23:36:33] <danheberden> http://gruntjs.com *cough*
[23:36:39] <tw2113> minify on build
[23:36:47] * coldhead pounds danheberden on the back
[23:38:12] <CJKay> chilversc_: So I think I'm just about done with a basic calc polyfill, and it has had the surprising upside of working with IE6
[23:38:32] <tw2113> i'm sorry

[23:40:46] <guzzlefry> woo, I just got my first infinite recursion error. :P
[23:41:21] <coldhead> guzzlefry: welcome home
[23:45:10] <Batdorf> danheberden: Is it a breeze to set up grunt server side?
[23:46:04] <coldhead> npm install grunt
[23:46:09] <coldhead> pretty breezy
[23:48:12] <Batdorf> well, im using it locally, but I dont have an idea how to set it up on my server. Is it the same?
[23:50:29] <coldhead> it should be
[23:50:38] <coldhead> installing node is usually the trickier bit
[23:50:51] <coldhead> and you need to make sure you're installing grunt for the right user
[23:53:07] <Ortund> Cork, I'm baaaaack lol
[23:53:07] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/4UyAj/
[23:53:29] <Ortund> Dunno how, but I broke it yesterday... spent all of last night staring at it and just couldn't find the problem
[23:54:53] <Max-P> Ortund, what's the problem with it exactly?
[23:56:18] <Ortund> Max-P, basically the jquery is supposed to rewite the html so that it'll fit the styles set there, lemme see if I still have a link to yesterday's last fiddle
[23:57:15] <Ortund> So this is more or less what it should look like if the jquery rewrites it correctly -> http://jsfiddle.net/Mk5pp/
[23:58:40] <Max-P> Ortund, Is there a particular reason why you have to reformat it instead of outputting it correctly from the beginning from the server?
[23:59:54] <guzzlefry> 0.o
