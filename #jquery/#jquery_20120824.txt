[00:00:35] <astropirate> 'morning Tram
[00:04:49] <martisj> how do i bind two events to one function?
[00:05:07] <martisj> on('mouseenter, mouseleave', function() {}) ?
[00:06:08] <NodeX> without a comma
[00:06:21] <NodeX> on('mousenter mouseleave');
[00:06:21] <martisj> alright thanks NodeX :)
[00:06:30] <NodeX> or in you case do "hover"
[00:06:41] <martisj> just hover/
[00:06:42] <martisj> ?
[00:06:45] <NodeX> hover does sboth
[00:06:48] <NodeX> both*
[00:06:50] <martisj> damn son
[00:07:16] <NodeX> you can pick out the event.type
[00:07:27] <ordinaryman09> any1 know how to make something like datalist for safari?
[00:07:41] <NodeX> if(event.type=='mouseenter') { ....
[00:07:50] <martisj> so can i do visibility visible ?
[00:07:54] <tw2113> mobile safari ordinaryman09
[00:08:11] <martisj> is there no way of doing it in one line?
[00:08:16] <martisj> that would be sick :)
[00:08:34] <NodeX> $('body').on('hover','.some-class',function(event){ if(event.type=='mouseenter') { do something on mouse enter } else { do somehting else}});
[00:11:43] <martisj> what about $('.mything').livequery('hover', function() { this.toggleClass('visible'); }); ?
[00:12:49] <Cork> martisj: no need for the livequery extension
[00:12:55] <Cork> its built into jquery now days
[00:13:08] <martisj> Cork: from which version?
[00:13:11] <martisj> we're using 1.7.2
[00:13:16] <Cork> s/extension/plugin/
[00:13:26] <Cork> like jquery 1.2.8
[00:13:39] <Cork> its changed a bit since though
[00:13:48] <Cork> its been depricated and replaced by .on now days
[00:13:56] <martisj> aha :)
[00:14:00] <martisj> thanks :)
[00:15:04] <martisj> it is going to be a hassle to change that though.
[00:15:06] <martisj> monolithic code with livequery everywhere.
[00:15:23] <Cork> well a start would be going s/livequery/live/
[00:15:24] <Cork> thats the old function name
[00:15:27] <Cork> on's syntax is a little bit different (much better),
[00:15:31] <Cork> but its basically the same thing
[00:16:16] <martisj> how is it different?
[00:16:35] <martisj> i am doing .on("hover", function(e) {});
[00:16:40] <Cork> it has a sain syntax
[00:16:52] <martisj> sane?
[00:17:01] <Cork> $(event holder).on('event type', 'selector', function)
[00:17:10] <martisj> aha, sweet :)
[00:17:16] <Cork> use livequery and live scans the dom and then doens't use the results
[00:17:23] <Cork> its a total waist of cpu time
[00:17:38] <mazzachre> Cork: I don't see how .on/.off is more sane that .bind/.unbind?
[00:17:54] <Cork> mazzachre: we‰r not talking about bind
[00:17:59] <Cork> *we'r
[00:18:03] <mazzachre> oh
[00:18:08] <Cork> and bind isn't depricated
[00:18:11] <Cork> ?.live
[00:18:13] <Cork> is
[00:18:13] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[00:18:39] <Palanivel> Hi Hiiiiii done a single html page with 5 diff tab with 5 diff div's...........my question is where ever am going to next tab the window not scrolling top.................what is the problem and what i want to do.........
[00:18:55] <Palanivel> i want to write any jquery function or css
[00:19:21] <Cork> what it does is you do a normal jquery selection $('target') jquery searches for the selector in the dom and builds and array of them; .live then uses the entered text selector as a check in a bound even for document
[00:19:40] <Cork> meaning the scan of the dom and building of the array was completely pointless
[00:19:45] <martisj> aha
[00:19:50] <martisj> and what does on do?
[00:20:09] <Cork> $('selector') is the "holder" of the event
[00:20:22] <Cork> it then takes the filer string as its own parameter
[00:20:29] <Cork> meaning no selection what so ever
[00:20:57] <Cork> ex. $('.buttons').live('click') is the exact same thing as $(document).on('click', '.buttons')
[00:21:07] <martisj> this isn't working though: $('.comments_container li').on("mouseenter", '.comment_tools', function(e){ $(this).toggleClass('visuallyhidden'); });
[00:21:07] <Cork> except more waistfull
[00:21:25] <tw2113> wasteful
[00:21:32] <Cork> does the li exist in the dom when you run the selector?
[00:21:41] <martisj> lemme check
[00:21:45] <oojacoboo> why is chrome preventing me from replacing the .html() of an edited textarea?
[00:21:48] <Cork> $('.comments_container li') has to match an existing element
[00:21:55] <Cork> (and if its removed the listner is gone)
[00:22:17] <martisj> yeah it exists
[00:22:19] <Cork> oojacoboo: a textarea doesn't have .html()
[00:22:28] <oojacoboo> well, technically it does
[00:22:30] <Cork> oh wait sorry my fault
[00:22:33] <oojacoboo> but I get your point
[00:22:40] <Cork> its inputs that doesn't :)
[00:22:45] <oojacoboo> right
[00:22:47] <Palanivel> @cork ...... u have any idea about my question
[00:22:47] <b-ot> Palanivel, no U have any idea about my question
[00:22:57] <oojacoboo> Cork, it works with val() though
[00:23:12] <macmartine> oojacoboo: b/c val is the correct way tot do it
[00:23:12] <oojacoboo> which is fine, just confused me a bit there
[00:23:19] <oojacoboo> macmartine, thanks capt
[00:23:22] <Cork> Palanivel: you need to scroll the page to top with js
[00:23:28] <martisj> lol i wasn't applyin the class so it couldn't toggle anything .:(
[00:23:32] <Palanivel> ya
[00:23:36] <Cork> Palanivel: as the page isn't changed that doesn't happen on its own
[00:23:37] <macmartine> oojacoboo: no prob, sarg
[00:24:03] <Cork> Palanivel:  window.scrollTop = 0
[00:24:04] <Palanivel> @cork ...... Not Possible ha
[00:24:17] <oojacoboo> which event occurs first, blur or click?
[00:24:17] <Cork> sure it is
[00:24:23] <oojacoboo> I know which one REALLY does
[00:24:25] <Cork> blur
[00:24:28] <oojacoboo> but which one will js consider?
[00:24:35] <Palanivel> @cork ......ill try and get back to u
[00:24:38] <Cork> blur > click > focus
[00:24:43] <oojacoboo> k
[00:24:58] <Cork> or it might actually be blur > focus > click
[00:25:05] <Cork> not completely sure there
[00:25:18] <oojacoboo> well, the html thing just solved all the mystery :)
[00:25:30] <oojacoboo> html() -> val()
[00:25:46] <Cork> ya, form elements should always use .val()
[00:26:01] <Cork> except for radio and checkboxes :)
[00:26:36] <oojacoboo> duly noted
[00:28:12] <martisj> Cork: in this line: $('.comments_container li').on("hover", '.comment_tools', function(e){     is comment_tools inside the li?
[00:28:25] <martisj> what does this refer to in that context?
[00:29:01] <Cork> $('.comments_container li').on("hover", '.comment_tools', function(e){ }) is similar to
[00:29:10] <Palanivel> @cork ......it's not working
[00:29:55] <Cork> $('.comments_container li').bind('hover', function(e) { if(!$(e.target).is('.comment_tools')) { return; } /* do something */ });
[00:30:33] <shesek> Cork, doesn't it also bind for hover on any children of .comments_container li?
[00:30:55] <Cork> actually, i'm not sure hover works
[00:31:10] <Cork> oh way no its mouseenter/mouserleave
[00:31:21] <martisj> yeah that's it
[00:31:22] <Cork> shesek: thats why i said similar
[00:31:23] <martisj> hmmmmm
[00:31:49] <shesek> Cork, that's quite a difference...
[00:32:06] <Cork> it is, but its close enough to explain how it works
[00:34:15] <Cork> shesek: i think i read your comment a bit wrong
[00:34:28] <Cork> the bind example is more restrictive then the on listner
[00:34:33] <Cork> not the other way around
[00:35:30] <Cork> ex if the selector was '.comment_tools a' the bind selector wouldn't have worked by the on does
[00:39:50] <Ankabout> can anyone tell why this simple script won't work?
[00:39:51] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/W8a5P/
[00:40:25] <Cork> your not closing your ready event handler
[00:41:20] <Ankabout> ah yeah great
[00:41:25] <Ankabout> ok then to my real question :)
[00:41:32] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/W8a5P/1/
[00:41:52] <Ankabout> how do I prevent that if I quickly hover on and off my "button" the animation happens many times in a row?
[00:42:12] <Cork> ?.stop @ Ankabout
[00:42:12] <bot-t> Ankabout, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[00:42:37] <Ankabout> yeah I tried adding a stop before the animation, but then if it stops halfway, the next animation doesn't fold out entirely
[00:43:06] <Ankabout> hmm in jsfiddle it works fine
[00:43:44] <Cork> .stop(null, true, true)
[00:44:02] <Cork> ah you don't need the null
[00:44:06] <Cork> .stop(true, true)
[00:44:39] <Ankabout> ahhh great, thanks
[00:45:49] <Ankabout> cork, that solves the not fully animating problem
[00:46:15] <Ankabout> but it seems if the animation is halfway, and my mouse leaves the hover area, if animation first jumps to the full position before closing again
[00:46:29] <Ankabout> does that mean I need a callback with a stop as well?
[00:46:34] <Cork> thats the last true value ya
[00:46:53] <Cork> if you skip the last true it won't complete the animation
[00:47:07] <Cork> but then you need to animate back to the original position on mouseleave
[00:47:16] <Cork> (can't use toggle)
[00:47:20] <Ankabout> ahhh ok
[00:47:31] <Ankabout> then I will just stick with it completing the animation
[00:47:42] <Ankabout> thanks a lot
[01:21:21] <demetan> I have a function $(function first(){ //}, if I want to reuse it in another place how I can do it ?
[01:23:18] <jarco> call it
[01:24:11] <wavez> is there a way to do slideToggle, only with width? I want to have a box that expands from small to large and closes back again, based on a toggle button.
[01:24:45] <embraceyourlove> Hi guys, can anyone help me with fancybox 2 ? I need to remove black border.
[01:29:15] <vectorshelve> here in the mouse out fuction... I want to restore the image to it's normal size http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/49/ how can i do it? now i have hardcoded it to a specific value....
[01:32:04] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: if you load the image with js, you get the original size
[01:32:50] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: no i am not loading it from the js... I am buiding an extension similar to FB zoom.. so I need to animate the image on mouseout to its original size
[01:33:38] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: you want the real image size, or the image size it had before you zoomed it?
[01:34:36] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: image size it had before  zooming http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/49/
[01:36:14] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/52/
[01:36:16] <se-lite_> like that?
[01:37:19] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: it still doesnt work.. the size on mouse out is not the size it had before  zooming
[01:37:32] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: and I want to do it without editing the html
[01:38:50] <davetarmac> Good morning
[01:39:16] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: you spelled "height" wrong in the html, thats why it has that shape in the start
[01:40:07] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: the spelling seems correct but still it isnt working
[01:41:37] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: if the spelling was correct, the picture would have been 150x150
[01:41:45] <se-lite_> but, the way you want it, http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/53/ works
[01:41:49] <se-lite_> (its basicly the code you have now)
[01:42:29] <se-lite_> (Except for your zoom ruin the picture aspect ratio)
[01:42:34] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/53/ yes nice but you removed height attribute from html img tag
[01:42:58] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: it was never there... you spelled it wrong, so it didn't "count"
[01:43:57] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: ok :) but theres one issue.. I am facing.. its working fine.. but try shaking the mouse in and out of the image and it will animate it as many times.. even when I have the mouse kept away after shaking it for long.. how can I fix it ?
[01:44:28] <yuotoo>  ^√Ç√ä√é√î√õ√¢√™√Æ√¥√ªƒàƒâƒúƒùƒ§ƒ•ƒ¥ƒµ≈ú≈ù≈¥≈µ≈∂≈∑ÀÜÃÇÃ≠·∑ç·∏í·∏ì·∏ò·∏ô·∏º·∏Ω·πä·πã·π∞·π±·π∂·π∑·∫ê·∫ë·∫§·∫•·∫¶·∫ß·∫®·∫©·∫™·∫´·∫¨·∫≠·∫æ·∫ø·ªÄ·ªÅ·ªÇ·ªÉ·ªÑ·ªÖ·ªÜ·ªá·ªê·ªë·ªí·ªì·ªî·ªï·ªñ·ªó·ªò·ªô‚®£‚®∂‚©ØÍûàÔºæÛ†Åû
[01:45:38] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: try http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/56/
[01:46:18] <JLT> Wow, 56 edits :P
[01:46:30] <se-lite_> JLT: its a lot of code ;)
[01:47:01] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: cool mate... and what if the img tag in html doesnt have the height or width attribute and I want to auto detect it ?
[01:47:45] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: that code already detect the displayed width/height
[01:48:03] <se-lite_> but, imo, you should try some yourself.. im not making a facebook picture module for you :)
[01:48:55] <JLT> it doesn't detect does it?
[01:48:59] <JLT> it just sets it as 500.
[01:49:01] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: yes the initial work was done by me... but I found some difficulty handling the part you helped me with,,, thats nice of you :) thanks a lot... and I have a last question which I have a little difficulty with
[01:49:12] <JLT> which isn't the full ... size of the img
[01:49:12] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: if you dont mind :)
[01:49:21] <faraway> vectorshelve: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/P8dnD/
[01:49:24] <JLT> http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/59/ this is what i came up with, but it don't work. heh.
[01:50:09] <faraway> vectorshelve: with that code you can detect image size
[01:50:45] <vectorshelve> faraway: yes// but se-lite_ code already works fine... thanks for the effort... JLT nice
[01:50:49] <adam_lynch> Hey, I've got a selector question if anyone wants to listen:
[01:51:03] <adam_lynch> I want to select all elements that have a certain attribute and its value is not empty
[01:51:17] <adam_lynch> I can select by element[attribute]
[01:51:20] <faraway> vectorshelve: not if the image is not loaded fully at the time the mouseover is triggered
[01:51:26] <adam_lynch> and element[attribute!=""]
[01:51:35] <adam_lynch> but I need those two in conjunction
[01:51:45] <blackspotwiggins> element[attr][attr!=""] ?
[01:51:46] <adam_lynch> I can't find a simple way to use conjunction
[01:51:48] <adam_lynch> is there one?
[01:51:59] <blackspotwiggins> but the second one implies the first anyway
[01:52:03] <adam_lynch> or is there a selector I don't know about which can help?
[01:52:07] <vectorshelve> my last doubt is in this code http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/60/ as u can see I have given a grey frame for the pic on mouse in... I want to give the frame a thin black border.. how can I do that ?
[01:52:12] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: what you want to do is: Set an onload event on the picture and from that get the size.. Then you want to scale it as you want to make a thumbnail
[01:52:35] <se-lite_> then you need to calculate the bigger size based on the same aspect ratio for the larger version
[01:52:42] <se-lite_> then done.. easy peasy
[01:52:51] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: yes... but too small in the world of jquery to do that great a job :) without your help
[01:52:54] <adam_lynch> blackspotwiggins: the second one does no imply the first
[01:53:06] <adam_lynch> http://jsfiddle.net/hDY2Y/
[01:53:28] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: you should read and learn, us spoon feeding you won't teach you anything
[01:53:37] <vectorshelve> faraway: can you show me the better code.. which would help that u suggested
[01:54:09] <adam_lynch> blackspotwiggins: I think the one you suggested works (el[at][at!=""])
[01:54:35] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: I understand... whatever I did so far was my own.. till the point from where you helped me like james bond.. :) but I need to complete this in the next 20 minutes.. and I have no one to help me.. I just started jquery last monday=..
[01:54:46] <xdjuj__> [10:52]  <vectorshelve> my last doubt is in this code http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/60/ as u can see I have given a grey frame for the pic on mouse in... I want to give the frame a thin black border.. how can I do that ?
[01:54:58] <xdjuj__> I already answer this question for you this morning
[01:55:05] <adam_lynch> blackspotwiggins: yeah think it does
[01:55:08] <se-lite_> vectorshelve: why does it have to be done in 20 min?
[01:55:08] <adam_lynch> why though?
[01:55:10] <d__> adam_lynch, yep, el[at][at!=""] would also be my guess, you can keep chaining those []
[01:55:11] <xdjuj__> And a little bit of manual reading would help you as well vectorshelve
[01:55:20] <blackspotwiggins> adam_lynch, how can you have a nonempty attribute without the attribute?
[01:55:22] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: yes... I am finding it hard to implement :(
[01:55:27] <vectorshelve> se-lite_: deadline.. :(
[01:55:42] <xdjuj__> http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/30/http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/30/
[01:55:52] <xdjuj__> http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/30/
[01:55:59] <xdjuj__> Here it is for your border
[01:56:05] <d__> HTML distinguished between not having an attribute and having an empty attribute
[01:56:07] <adam_lynch> blackspotwiggins: yeah that's what I needed
[01:56:10] <xdjuj__> It was this morning and only for you
[01:56:22] <adam_lynch> I assumed that would only work when chaining different attributes
[01:56:25] <adam_lynch> not the same one
[01:56:31] <xdjuj__> And here is the manual vectorshelve => http://api.jquery.com/css/
[01:56:50] <xdjuj__> And here is another great tool :) => http://google.fr
[01:57:01] <xdjuj__> Or .com doesn't matter ;-)
[01:57:03] <adam_lynch> yeah you can't have a non-empty attr without the attr, but you can have the attr and it empty... I want to select all non-empty placeholders
[01:57:03] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: yes but I need the red border above the frame.. :( thats exaclty where I am stuck up bro... the image, the frame and then this red thin border
[01:57:22] <adam_lynch> so I think input[placeholder][placeholder!=""] will do
[01:57:30] <xdjuj__> Where is there a Frame vectorshelve ?
[01:57:35] <blackspotwiggins> adam_lynch, so if you only do [placeholder!=""] it selects wrong elements?
[01:58:02] <ravenzz> adam_lynch input[placeholder][placeholder!=""]
[01:58:16] <d__> Yeah, I can't imagine cases where that [at][at!=""] isn't equal to [at!=""]
[01:58:27] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: what I meant by frame is the solid #C0C0C0  (thick grey border) to the image -> http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/60/
[01:58:33] <adam_lynch> ravenzz: isn't that the same as I said?
[01:58:45] <d__> However, if you were wanting to do [!at][at=""] it would be a different question, then you need them both
[01:58:47] <adam_lynch> blackspotwiggins: it selects elements without the placeholder attribute
[01:59:00] <blackspotwiggins> strange
[01:59:05] <adam_lynch> see http://jsfiddle.net/hDY2Y/1/
[01:59:23] <xdjuj__> And what's wrong with it vectorshelve ?
[01:59:29] <adam_lynch> well it seems logically correct to me
[01:59:43] <adam_lynch> the attribute is not the empty string so it evaluates to true
[02:00:01] <xdjuj__> you mean this must be "over" the image ?
[02:00:07] <blackspotwiggins> that's unexpected behaviour
[02:00:09] <xdjuj__> like a mask ?
[02:00:14] <blackspotwiggins> but the docs say that as well
[02:00:15] <blackspotwiggins> dunno
[02:00:19] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: nothing wrong but what I am failing to get done is adding a thin border to that grey border..
[02:00:20] <d__> Ah, I see
[02:01:57] <xdjuj__> vectorshelve
[02:02:04] <adam_lynch> the docs say what?
[02:02:14] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: yes
[02:02:37] <xdjuj__> ==> http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/61/
[02:03:12] <xdjuj__> You're in your 20 min, you won't be fired
[02:04:21] <xdjuj__> BUT in my opinion vectorshelve there's a lot of zooming jQuery plugin much more sexy than your effect :) That's not really "graphic"
[02:04:30] <xdjuj__> You won't have a CSS award for this work :p
[02:11:36] <d__> Does anyone know the best way of getting jQuery UI widgets to inherit from multiple classes/roles? I'm creating an XML editor and want my element and text node widgets to inherit from a childnode role/widget so they can have things like previousSibling() but element nodes and document nodes to inherit from a parentnode role/widget so they can have methods like children() and append().
[02:12:38] <d__> Can I just have them as entirely separate widgets and just apply those on creation, or is that bad practice?
[02:12:45] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: I am just a kid in jquery world.. so for now I should gratify myself with this :) thanks though
[02:13:57] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: the red border only in the right side bottom and side.. not on the left.. is it the jsfiddle tab blocking the view ?
[02:14:26] <d__> (I'd like to avoid having to work out the appropriate class to get the method from, which seems like a really bizarre way to do OO).
[02:15:37] <Cork> d__: just add the classes you need to the already existing elements
[02:15:41] <Cork> theres no magic there
[02:15:51] <Cork> just avoid the .ui- namespace
[02:16:01] <d__> Cork, thanks!
[02:17:58] <Cork> d__: this isn't extjs we'r talking about, theres very little overhead over the standard dom elements
[02:18:20] <xdjuj__> yes vectorshelve
[02:18:20] <xdjuj__> http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/65/
[02:18:46] <xdjuj__> That what I told you NOT to work in JSfiddle but on your local environnement
[02:18:55] <xdjuj__> But you didn't listen to me :)
[02:20:34] <xdjuj__> And also vectorshelve I don't understand why you are using "find()" ?
[02:20:49] <xdjuj__> Why don't you use $("img") ??
[02:20:49] <d__> Cork: Thanks, I was more worried about doing something that was deprecated for style reasons.
[02:21:12] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: thats coz I need only pic up img inside specific div so...
[02:21:49] <xdjuj__> Are you able to trigger this specific div ?
[02:21:52] <xdjuj__> if so
[02:22:02] <xdjuj__> You can use $(".mydiv img")
[02:22:19] <xdjuj__> And better would be
[02:22:31] <xdjuj__> jQuery("#mydiv img");
[02:22:44] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: could you apply it on code ? http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/66/
[02:23:03] <xdjuj__> You only have one div on your code...
[02:23:04] <xdjuj__> :)
[02:23:29] <Palanivel> line with water sea flowing animation is possible to create using in jquery...........i tried lot but am not get.............please share any links which u know'
[02:23:42] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: multiple div with one class $('.knome-kso-timeline-content') and need pick up img only within those div :)
[02:27:20] <xdjuj__> vectorshelve => http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/68/
[02:29:32] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: yes it gets the background border for other divs... :( how to get over that ?
[02:29:57] <xdjuj__> with css vectorshelve !!!
[02:30:02] <xdjuj__> :)
[02:30:27] <xdjuj__> http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/69/
[02:30:37] <xdjuj__> damned vectorshelve :) You must make efforts
[02:30:50] <xdjuj__> We can't do EVERYTHING for you :)
[02:31:05] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: I do.. but when you pour your magic on my code.. I become helpless and only admire it sitting on the bay :)
[02:31:42] <xdjuj__> There's nothing to admire :) That's just first step CSS :)
[02:31:58] <xdjuj__> Maybe that's what you learn the first day you try CSS :)
[02:32:52] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: which is the lesser next aspect ratio to width: "1024px", height: "646px" ?
[02:33:27] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: and is there a way to auto fit the img to the best possible fit resolution... :) that wouldnt b possible ryt,,,
[02:35:41] <xdjuj__> vectorshelve
[02:35:46] <xdjuj__> That's just mathematics
[02:35:54] <xdjuj__> Calculate the ratio
[02:36:01] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: ok
[02:36:02] <xdjuj__> And then you're done
[02:36:06] <xdjuj__> Something like
[02:36:16] <xdjuj__> widh=$(this).width();
[02:36:27] <xdjuj__> height=jQUery(this).height();
[02:36:31] <soee> is there any way to debug what handlers events are called on some elements (in my case when sumit button is clicked)
[02:36:37] <xdjuj__> Then, you can do maths on width/height
[02:36:56] <xdjuj__> zoom_w = width*4;
[02:37:05] <xdjuj__> zoom_h = height*4;
[02:37:19] <xdjuj__> And then
[02:37:34] <xdjuj__> animate width=>zoom_w and so on
[02:37:55] <xdjuj__> You should zoom EVEN more, because the girl is pretty ;-)
[02:39:10] <xdjuj__> You even can calculate the size of the box/div in which you are, to determinate the max size
[02:39:16] <xdjuj__> Just do maths :)
[02:39:33] <nFFF> soee, what do you mean debug?
[02:40:16] <nFFF> I think jQuery stores event handlers in $(el).data('events'); if this helps
[02:43:07] <faraway> soee: since 1.8 you cannot access with data('events') you need to use $._data(element, "events") and it is not a supported public interface
[02:43:56] <soee> i found something helpful called Visual Events
[02:44:18] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: the girl is hot but I am cold in the office... :(
[02:50:27] <stefuNz> hey, can anybody recommend a good jQuery templating plugin?

[02:56:35] <nVee> hey guys, I need to get the value of an id of an input box next to the button I pressed. I understand I can use find and closest, can anyone help me perhaps?
[02:57:00] <shoky> nVee: not without more info
[02:57:13] <shoky> "next to" is too vague
[02:57:41] <vectorshelve> shoky: img was missing :)
[02:57:49] <nVee> shoky: Sorry :) I have 2 input boxes next to eachother (in a container called .boxes), I need to get the ID of the first input field when I click on the button right next to it
[02:57:56] <nVee> does that help?
[02:58:43] <shoky> nVee: html would be best
[02:59:08] <xdjuj__> I prefer the nice girl vectorshelve
[02:59:12] <d__> Does `$(this).prev().attr('id')` work?
[02:59:22] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: me too :D love her body

[03:00:30] <shoky> they all have the same id?
[03:00:35] <nVee> d__, let me try quick :)
[03:01:00] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: not working as per your formula http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/88/ something I messed up
[03:01:31] <nVee> shoky, sorry, i just quickly typed it out
[03:01:37] <nVee> copy and paste lol
[03:01:48] <nVee> but yes d__, it works like a charm!!

[03:47:50] <Kambfhase> nabdev: there are plugins for form validation.
[03:48:48] <Kambfhase> vectorshelve: try hoverIntent plugin

[03:53:54] <Deviad> Hi
[03:53:58] <devslash> ?
[03:54:01] <devslash> i know
[03:54:12] <devslash> but what does that have to do with my problem
[03:54:42] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: thanks bro :)
[03:54:49] <Deviad> Can anyone tell me how I can show an alternative message for goMap when it cannot reach google servers? I noticed that when I'm not connected to the internet the fact that goMap cannot access google servers prevents all of the other plugins from loading.
[03:54:52] <Kambfhase> there is not button with the id #addAll on that ppage
[03:55:09] <devslash> its not a button its a link that i add to the jquery file tree
[03:55:13] <xdjuj__> vectorshelve => http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/114/
[03:55:38] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: whats the differnce between 113 and 114 ?
[03:55:49] <xdjuj__>    ratio = 3;
[03:55:53] <Kambfhase> Well if it not on that page, jQuery cannot find it. read this: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[03:55:59] <xdjuj__> And CSS cursor ==> in the CSS
[03:56:18] <devslash> look at my page i have play and add buttons on the file tree and the event triggers just fine
[03:56:42] <devslash> for those 2
[03:57:30] <vectorshelve> xdjuj__: cool
[03:58:14] <Kambfhase> devslash: <a class="addAllTracks">add all</a> << this button does nit have an id
[03:58:49] <devslash> Kambfhase: ahh thanks
[03:59:03] <Kambfhase> np
[03:59:47] <devslash> i added id
[03:59:50] <devslash> still not working
[04:01:26] <devslash> any idea
[04:02:30] <devslash> Kambfhase:  i didn't add an id for my other links and those still work
[04:03:00] <Kambfhase> devslash: please read the link i gave you, i think that might be the problem here
[04:04:22] <devslash> that doesn't make sense
[04:05:48] <Kambfhase> i think the problem is, that you try to add the handler before the element is atteched to the page
[04:06:50] <devslash> its in ready: function (){
[04:06:58] <devslash> wouldn't that prevent that from happening
[04:08:04] <Kambfhase> It's just my best guess. I am not a tree pro
[04:10:24] <Deviad> Anyone familiar with gomap?
[04:11:01] <Deviad> I could create an <iframe></iframe> so that if for some reason the server cannot access google servers the page is still perfectly viewable. But I was looking for a better solution.
[04:13:10] <kelye> is there a way to capture a mouse click while holding down a key ?
[04:15:22] <Kambfhase> devslash: btw, "foobar".slice(0,-2) gives you a string except for the last two chars
[04:15:35] <devslash> oh ok thanks
[04:15:41] <devslash> ill fix that later
[04:15:51] <devslash> righ tnow I'm trying to fix this issue

[04:31:47] <regx> hi
[04:32:14] <regx>  hi I want to use a regular expression like /[a-zA-Z]/ but that doesnt permit numbers.
[04:32:23] <regx>  anyone can help?
[04:32:29] <regx> I want it to confirm just letters.
[04:32:48] <monkeh13> how about symbols? included or not?
[04:33:17] <j_wright> you what latin alphabet and numbers?
[04:33:21] <j_wright> want?
[04:33:30] <regx> not
[04:33:33] <regx> just letters
[04:33:35] <regx> like
[04:33:40] <regx> abc def
[04:34:06] <j_wright> so /a-z/ ?
[04:34:14] <j_wright> [a-z] i mean
[04:34:43] <regx> I want to block the string when there are numbers
[04:34:57] <monkeh13> [^0-9]?
[04:35:07] <j_wright> you want to anchor it
[04:35:14] <j_wright> ^[a-z]$
[04:35:20] <regx> and also the other characters except letters
[04:35:42] <j_wright>  /^[a-z]$/ will only pass if the string only contains characters
[04:35:52] <j_wright> also use the i flag to make it case insensitive
[04:36:09] <regx> how to use i flag?
[04:36:34] <regx> ot what is i flag?
[04:36:36] <regx> or*
[04:36:44] <j_wright> new Regexp("^[a-z]$", "i")
[04:37:01] <j_wright> i flag is case insensitivity so you don't have to include a-z and A-Z
[04:37:08] <regx> understood.
[04:37:09] <devslash> hey i need help with link event
[04:37:59] <devslash> hey j_wright
[04:38:26] <j_wright> hey
[04:41:16] <j_wright> oops regx i mean
[04:41:20] <j_wright> new Regexp("^[a-z]+$", "i")
[04:41:38] <j_wright> otherwise it would only match one character
[04:41:48] <regx> Im checking
[04:44:42] <regx> it allows the string like abc123
[04:44:46] <regx> but it mustnt
[04:46:49] <j_wright> erm
[04:48:12] <j_wright> show me
[04:49:12] <j_wright> i get null from r.exec("abc123") and ["abc"] from r.exec("abc")
[04:53:05] <regx> ok
[04:53:09] <regx> I did it now.
[04:53:11] <regx> thanks a lot.

[05:36:33] <shoky> mm it's not supposed to go on a textbox, no
[05:36:57] <darkangel> shoky: So you have to create a div and then manually sync with the text box?
[05:37:25] <shoky> darkangel: if you want the slider value in a textbox.. yeah

[06:01:12] <MZAWeb> appel: $.when(func1(), func2())
[06:01:13] <appel> MZAWeb: yes, but I have a array of promises, I don't know how many
[06:01:28] <appel> $.when(arrayOfFuncs)
[06:01:31] <appel> ?
[06:03:08] <MZAWeb> appel: $.when.apply(null, my_array);
[06:03:58] <Koopz> ever tried making a combobox with remote source?
[06:04:26] <appel> and how would the $.when.apply(null, my_array).done(function(?????) { })  look like?
[06:04:58] <MZAWeb> looks good, doesn't work?
[06:05:40] <MZAWeb> appel: In general func.apply(me, params) will call func with this == me and (array)params as parameters
[06:06:10] <appel> ok
[06:06:23] <appel> but i can get all the arguments of a function as an array anyway?
[06:07:06] <appel> thanks MZAWeb , you've been a great help
[06:07:10] <MZAWeb> appel: also for when you should use .then not .done
[06:07:25] <appel> ok
[06:11:00] <appel> MZAWeb: should "then" always be used for derred/promise objects instead of "done"?
[06:11:12] <appel> deferred
[06:11:31] <MZAWeb> appel: well, both work, it's a matter of preference now that I think of it
[06:11:37] <MZAWeb> you can use .done and .fail
[06:11:41] <MZAWeb> if you want
[06:11:56] <appel> .fail == .error && .done == .then ?
[06:12:13] <MZAWeb> $.when.apply($, promises).done(function() { ... }).fail(function() { ... });
[06:12:45] <ajpiano> appel: .then( successFn, failFn ) == .done( successFn ).fail( failFn );
[06:13:00] <appel> ahh
[06:13:02] <MZAWeb> appel: no, .then has 2 params for both callbacks .then(done(), fail()
[06:13:10] <MZAWeb> appel: ajpiano that.
[06:13:11] <appel> i'll use done then
[06:13:14] <MZAWeb> appel: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[06:21:25] <NexHD> hy
[06:21:31] <NexHD> i have a question
[06:22:26] <NexHD> how i do to execute only onetime .after method on a if condition
[06:22:27] <NexHD> ?
[06:27:23] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/SPkgN/1/ <-need some help setting the label as value of the input...
[06:28:37] <Cakey> hi guys, question. https://gist.github.com/3450483 any idea why .attr('value') returns a blank?
[06:29:36] <ajpiano> Cakey: use .val() to get the value of elements, not attr("val")
[06:31:02] <gianiaz> hi, anyone knows how the google docs uploader is made? do you have any hint or tutorial?
[06:33:14] <Cakey> ajpiano: oh, val returns nil too
[06:33:16] <Cakey> i mean blank
[06:33:22] <Cakey> let me update the gist to reflect that
[06:33:38] <ajpiano> Cakey: just make a fiddle
[06:33:40] <ajpiano> or jsbin
[06:33:44] <ajpiano> so it can be seen failing live
[06:36:32] <Taneem> Cakey: are you sure that's being picked up as a jquery object?
[06:37:21] <eip56> morning nerds
[06:46:44] <majd> i have a $("#radio").buttonset(), and i want to automatically select the first button. should i just do $("#radio > label").first().click(), or is there a correct way to do it?
[06:48:23] <MZAWeb> majd: .attr( 'checked', true );
[06:48:54] <gianiaz> majd I think it's better to set the radio checked value, then call .button('refresh')
[06:50:20] <gianiaz> majd, button('refresh') it's necessary only if you want to change the value after button initialization
[06:53:03] <Cakey> Taneem, ajpiano : thanks for the intention to help. i dug deeper with Visual Event and found a function that does this '  //element.find("input[type=text]").val("");'
[06:53:04] <majd> MZAWeb: gianiaz awesome, thanks!
[06:53:32] <Taneem> Cakey: cool, good to know
[06:53:41] <Cakey> that code is evil and has been dealt with. it was for a feature that doesn't exist anymore and was left behind for some reason when it got taken out, thanks for the willingness to help!
[06:59:52] <MaxymiserTE> Is there a function to crop text by a certain amount of lines? I want crop after 9 lines.
[07:02:04] <MZAWeb> MaxymiserTE: define lines
[07:03:54] <MaxymiserTE> ?
[07:05:33] <xec> MaxymiserTE: if the lines end with a newline char or <br> it should be easy, but if it's wrapped by element width, not quite
[07:05:44] <MZAWeb> MaxymiserTE: if the text has <br/>s to break lines, you can. If not you can check for height
[07:05:47] <d__> MaxymiserTE: And define crop. You can set a max-height css value to an element and control its overflow-y behaviour. But if you want to chop the text, then javascript doesn't really have an easy way of working out when anygiven lines end.
[07:05:49] <MZAWeb> and calculate from there
[07:06:05] <MaxymiserTE> The div is plain text pulling ajax content
[07:06:11] <MaxymiserTE> i am using .text()
[07:06:21] <xec> MaxymiserTE: that doesn't really answer anything
[07:06:28] <MZAWeb> MaxymiserTE: why not use css max-height?
[07:06:39] <ajpiano> #foo { overflow: hidden; max-height: 90px; line-height: 10px; text-overflow: ellipsis; }
[07:06:49] <MaxymiserTE> that will limit but lose the wrap
[07:06:59] <MaxymiserTE> i have text wrapping around a floated image
[07:07:13] <Seanmcn> http://jsfiddle.net/vmhk6/19/ <- Can someone help please, stupid jQuery UI is giving me headache so early in day! Description on jsFiddle.
[07:07:51] <xec> MaxymiserTE: why would setting max-height change any wrapping?
[07:08:17] <MaxymiserTE> I don't know but when i put overflow:hidden; it keeps the text to the right
[07:08:30] <MaxymiserTE> and does not wrap around the bottom of the image
[07:08:48] <xec> ?demo @ MaxymiserTE
[07:08:49] <bot-t> MaxymiserTE, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:10:17] <eregi> hey! My js is not working on iPhone because of one event which isn't even called. I found out that the problem is caused by this part of that event - http://pastebin.com/sad89qzv any ideas what's the problem?
[07:11:01] <walidvb> Hi all! I'm trying to create a slideshow of images, full screen. I'm using cycle, and actually I'm creating a nested slideshow(vertical slideshow consisting of several horz slideshows). I cannot get it to stay fullscreen. the hierarchy of relative and absolute div positioning make my result have a height of 0 :(
[07:11:03] <walidvb> example is there: http://vbbros.net/dietz/works/project
[07:11:03] <xec> eregi: what is $(this).("div:first") supposed to do?
[07:11:06] <walidvb> (imgs are in #page-wrapper>#main-wrapper>...) sry bout the markup
[07:11:09] <walidvb> been on this for the past 2 days, would really appreciate some help!
[07:11:15] <walidvb> thanks! :)
[07:11:15] <ajpiano> xec: nothing. it's invalid code
[07:11:22] <MaxymiserTE> http://i45.tinypic.com/6hp6ps.jpg  this is without the overflow
[07:11:29] <ajpiano> xec: probably missing an .is("foo") in there
[07:11:38] <ajpiano> or .find()
[07:11:47] <MaxymiserTE> http://i49.tinypic.com/9knfvs.jpg if i put overflow:hidden
[07:12:10] <eregi> xec, oh, looks like it should be without those brackets, just .remove
[07:12:14] <bish0p> who likes jquery?
[07:12:19] <MZAWeb> MaxymiserTE: count how many chars you can hold in that height and limit the sting lenght
[07:12:25] <MaxymiserTE> I'd like it to look like the one without the overflow and limit to 9 lines
[07:12:37] <MZAWeb> *string
[07:13:07] <Seanmcn> http://jsfiddle.net/vmhk6/19/ <- Can someone help please, jQueryUI acting buggy for me, Description on jsFiddle.
[07:13:13] <MZAWeb> MaxymiserTE: Actually, I'd make the server side script crop it, and get it already chopped
[07:13:45] <MaxymiserTE> That would defeat the purpose of jquery
[07:14:08] <xec> eregi: like ajpiano says, it is invalid as it is in that paste anyway. what's correct depends on what you're trying to make it do.
[07:15:18] <eregi> xec, well I need to remove the parent element.
[07:15:21] <xec> eregi: also, i don't think a function is a valid 1st argument to .slideUp() ?
[07:15:55] <xec> oh wait the duration is optional, nevermind
[07:15:57] <eregi> xec, didn't got what you were meaning
[07:16:01] <eregi> yes
[07:17:07] <eregi> xec, I was thinking that  $(this).parents("div:first").remove(); would remove the parent element with it's contents..
[07:18:19] <Kambfhase> Seanmcn: if you comment out the line with "option" it works
[07:19:26] <timing> what is the best element to bind a key event to? document or body?
[07:21:03] <xec> eregi: well, inside the callback, $(this) is going to be the element that is finished sliding up. and seeing as you already called .slideUp() on the closest ancestor div, $(this).remove() should be sufficient to remove that ancestor.
[07:21:46] <eregi> xec,  $(this) is going to be the element that is
[07:21:51] <eregi>              finished sliding up.
[07:22:08] <eregi> Didn't know this! :) Thanks!
[07:22:22] <serAphim> when using ui tabs with ajax and calling tabs("select",2), how can i prevent loading the default content of that tab?
[07:23:04] <serAphim> it's firing two requests, one for the link i clicked and one for the content which should be loaded when the tab is selected...
[07:24:26] <serAphim> both are loaded at the right place, so i end up with the content which finished loading last
[07:24:45] <serAphim> seeing the other one until that one finished
[07:26:00] <xec> serAphim: clicking links doesn't normally fire ajax requests, so there's something missing here - is your code live somewhere?
[07:30:15] <sh0ne> How can I toggle the name of button on click? For example, I have a button that says 'Show comments' and when I click it I want to says 'Hide comments'. Can it be done?
[07:30:39] <serAphim> xec: it does because the link is inside a list element of tab navigation
[07:30:49] <serAphim> xec: it is online, but you'd need to log in :/
[07:31:07] <Kambfhase> ?text @ sh0ne
[07:31:08] <bot-t> sh0ne, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[07:31:18] <Progster> anyone ever tried combining custom validation with h5validate?
[07:34:15] <xec> serAphim: thats ok, i gotta go drink some beer anyway. have you tried rubber duck debugging?
[07:34:42] <serAphim> xec: no, never heard of that. gonna have a look
[07:36:11] <Guest_> Ôºà¬∞‚ñ°¬∞‚îª‚îÅ‚îªÔªø HANDS UP MAGGOTS
[07:38:59] <serAphim> xec: lol :D i know what's happening - the tab("select",2) requests what would be loaded when i click on the tab - and the $("#ui-tabs-2").load(this.href); requests what i really want to see
[07:39:48] <serAphim> i just need a way to prevent the tab("select") from loading somehing :/
[07:46:07] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/c80wsr4vozg5kjedqspua - I click the button #add-customerorderer then my form appears  and the "#add-customerorderer" dissappears, which it should, then I click cancel and the button #add-customerorderer appear again, however, this time the form isn't appearing when the button is clicked again...
[07:47:17] <nisseni> however, the add-customerorder-button is hidden
[07:47:26] <nisseni> the form is written in php with a framework...
[07:47:37] <nFFF> ?mdn event delegation
[07:47:39] <bot-t> nFFF, Event Object - jQuerys event system normalizes the event object according to W3C standards . The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler. Most properties from the original event are copied ov... http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[07:48:01] <nFFF> nisseni, probably you need to bind the event to the parent of yo element
[07:48:32] <nFFF> when you reload html dynamiclly all previous events are lost on that element
[07:48:52] <nFFF> or more accuractely javascript doesn't see it as the same element being reloaded, but rather a new element
[07:50:05] <Kambfhase> why do you have $(function() { .. }) inside a click handler?
[07:51:25] <nisseni> Kambfhase: no idea...
[07:52:01] <nFFF> lol :>
[07:52:59] <nisseni> :)
[07:53:23] <nisseni> nFFF: so it should work even tho the form is rendered with php?
[07:53:35] <nisseni> nFFF: I mean, if I do it correctly
[08:04:14] <palpaly> >learned web developement >don't know what to do with it
[08:04:17] <rgr> hi how would I match against all elements of class "X" but not of class "Y"? e.g class="X" matches but class="X Y" does not?
[08:05:50] <ajpiano> rgr: $(".x:not(.y)")
[08:06:40] <serAphim> with tabs and ajax, is there some way to prevent tabs("select") from loading the default content of the tab?
[08:08:35] <ajpiano> serAphim: i don't believe so
[08:08:48] <ajpiano> seems like an odd use case that you would use ajax tabs but sometimes not want the content to load when the tab is selected
[08:12:51] <serAphim> ajpiano: not really...it's possible to hijack links to load inside the tabs, so it should be possible to load something different there from the start
[08:13:44] <ajpiano> serAphim: not that i feel like digging into this too deep, but i imagine with some combination of select and load callbacks, you could get what you're looking for
[08:15:21] <someprimetime> it's so early o.O
[08:16:49] <serAphim> ajpiano: i just tried another approach, changing the href of the tab link - which clearly failed because it's not the url anymore but #ui-tabs-x - where did the url go, and can i change that?
[08:18:20] <serAphim> it should be stored somewhere, can i access it?
[08:19:14] <ajpiano> i'm not sure, this would obviuosly be a lot easier with a demo
[08:19:17] <someprimetime> ajpiano: you have to choose between backbone, knockout, and angular. which one and what is the reason in one sentence (or less)? i kind of need to make up my mind today and those are the three i've been contemplating, but backbone and knockout are close competitors
[08:19:49] <ajpiano> backbone because i have a year and a half of experience developing and delivering apps with it
[08:20:01] <ajpiano> whereas knockout and angular i would just be dabbling with for the first time
[08:20:27] <ajpiano> which isn't necessarily a recipe for shipping
[08:20:28] <ajpiano> :p
[08:21:08] <someprimetime> cool i think that's what most of my team was agreeing on as well‚Ä¶ i've been reading it makes you write apps with less automagic and more vanilla js which is always a good thing imo
[08:21:16] <someprimetime> thanks man
[08:21:31] <ajpiano> someprimetime: backbone + requirejs, though, ftw
[08:22:11] <someprimetime> oh word‚Ä¶ would this matter if we minify all of our js code into one file though?
[08:22:28] <ajpiano> i use https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb
[08:22:39] <ajpiano> someprimetime: this is *how* you minify the js code into one file
[08:22:43] <ajpiano> or at least, how i do
[08:23:07] <someprimetime> ok rad thanks we're going to be drastically rewriting all of our js in the coming months so this is a huge step in the right direction
[08:23:07] <someprimetime> thanks
[08:23:13] <ajpiano> sweet
[08:23:28] <ajpiano> having clearly demarcated dependencies, which you get from requirejs, is a big win in that case
[08:24:01] <serAphim> doh. how could i oversee the "url" method -.- ajpiano: it's working :)
[08:25:27] <snover> someprimetime: was that the full list that you considered or just the finalists?
[08:27:01] <someprimetime> snover: those were pretty much the ones that stuck out to me. i went through a huge list a co-worker linked me to from some smashing magazine article (of all places) but it had listed pretty much all of them so i knew what was out there
[08:27:05] <someprimetime> let me see if i can't dig it up
[08:27:13] <someprimetime> coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/27/journey-through-the-javascript-mvc-jungle/
[08:27:24] <someprimetime> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/27/journey-through-the-javascript-mvc-jungle/ rather (sorry for double link post)
[08:28:23] <walidvb> i have this really weird issue. i run a .bind() fct, that is run once(or at least the log preceeding it), but the callback is called twice on click...
[08:28:31] <walidvb> would anyoneknow about that?
[08:28:47] <walidvb> example: http://vbbros.net/dietz/works/project
[08:29:16] <snover> someprimetime: what are you building?
[08:30:18] <someprimetime> just re-writing all of our current js code to make it more maintable at the company i work for
[08:31:15] <snover> and this thing that this code exists inside is‚Ä¶
[08:31:30] <ajpiano> someprimetime: snover is trying to ask you if you also considered dojo
[08:31:38] <ajpiano> he isn't doing a good job of asking you that though
[08:31:43] <snover> ajpiano: not really
[08:31:47] <snover> that article spends like
[08:31:49] <snover> 10 paragraphs
[08:31:50] <snover> talking about it
[08:31:50] <snover> so
[08:32:07] <ajpiano> oh
[08:32:59] <someprimetime> that article is pretty long-winded tbh‚Ä¶ i just liked it for it's comprehensive list of all the current js frameworks out atm
[08:43:09] <sjeijk> can jquery change the url in th address bar without reloading?
[08:47:34] <xdjuj__> sjeijk using history yes it's possible
[08:48:09] <xdjuj__> sjeijk > https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-hashchange
[08:48:30] <rickdrink> hey there :)
[08:48:30] <xdjuj__> Hum‚Ä¶ Very old
[08:48:40] <na8flush> im having a bit of trouble with a jquery plugin, slides.js. i seem to somehow have broken the actual sliding animation even though the images still change. id love some suggestions for what to look for, im about to rip my hair out
[08:48:41] <xdjuj__> Maybe there's newer and better
[08:49:51] <xdjuj__> sjeijk => http://stackoverflow.com/questions/570276/changing-location-hash-with-jquery-ui-tabs
[08:50:00] <xdjuj__> window.location.hash = ui.tab.hash;
[08:50:16] <sjeijk> ok cool thanks
[08:50:44] <na8flush> heres a jsfiddle of what i mean: http://jsfiddle.net/x45fE/1/
[08:51:30] <rickdrink> Hey, guys. I'd like to distribute online my first plugin, any tips? Should I setup a dedicated site? or just Github? Thanks. :)
[08:52:27] <Francis47> Can someone take a look at a site me http://ny.dev.arbejderen.dk/arbejde-og-kapital and perhaps tell me why the fixed positioning is "jumping" on left side, when its not on the right side? - Im using this http://jsfiddle.net/nGfUk/ to get the fixed position on both sides.
[08:52:37] <xdjuj__> sjeijk for example => 	jQuery(document).on('click','.test', function(e) { window.location.hash = "#"+jQuery(this).attr('class'); e.preventDefault(); });
[08:52:39] <tash> If anyone has used DataTables + its server-side processing, can you please see this and maybe help me out? http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/11479#Item_1
[08:56:34] <nanicoar> Good evening gentlemen.
[08:57:10] <rickdrink> hi
[08:58:51] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: that song just trolled me again
[08:58:59] <ryanneufeld> hahahah
[08:59:03] <ryanneufeld> me too yesterday
[09:09:04] <dogarrhea2> $() why do some people wrap their function declarations like so?
[09:09:22] <dogarrhea2> $(function()) just executes the function rigth?
[09:09:42] <dogarrhea2> which is the same as function(){}() ?
[09:09:45] <ajpiano> $(function(){}); is shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[09:10:15] <ajpiano> $(function(){}) is not a shorthand for function(){}()
[09:10:45] <dogarrhea2> oh $() is just document.ready
[09:11:11] <dogarrhea2> is either one of these ways deprecated?
[09:12:07] <ajpiano> nope
[09:12:25] <dogarrhea2> recommendation on future standard use amongst a team of developers?
[09:13:28] <lduros> anyone uses the supersized js slideshow plugin?
[09:13:46] <Haprog> dogarrhea2: $() by itself is not document.ready. It just acts as a shorthand for document.ready ONLY when you give it a function.
[09:14:48] <dogarrhea2> i think i'll just stick with $(document).ready just because it's less ambiguous
[09:14:55] <dogarrhea2> even though it's more verboes
[09:15:11] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: that's what i go for as well
[09:15:35] <Slugge> how can i set a password fields value to nothing?
[09:15:44] <Slugge> $('#password').val(''); <--- does not work
[09:16:27] <dogarrhea2> hrm maybe you can delete the password field and add a new one
[09:16:36] <dogarrhea2> the actual input element
[09:16:59] <Slugge> well, i really dont want to do that, as i see that as a bad practice
[09:17:21] <[MAN]> hi guys, I have a small problem with jquery ui dialog (modal) http://jsfiddle.net/2FkAx/, addthis dialog with text field does not work in Firefox, I can't enter value in text box, but I can paste to it
[09:19:54] <Grexeo> http://jsfiddle.net/7dV9S/2/ - is it possible to use .remove() on elements not in the DOM?
[09:20:24] <silverwind> Not on the main DOM tree? Sure.
[09:20:33] <someprimetime> Slugge: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/RELru/
[09:21:18] <gnarf> [MAN]: my first guess is that the modal key handler might be preventing typing in the field for some reason, but its probabbly some voodoo magic between addthis and ui.dialog
[09:21:27] <Slugge> someprimetime: wierd, does not work here, might it be because ive "saved" the password in my browser?
[09:21:43] <someprimetime> Slugge: yeah try clearing those out in your preferences
[09:21:51] <someprimetime> that could very well be the issue
[09:21:57] <[MAN]> I thought it is z-index, but it does not help
[09:22:25] <someprimetime> Grexeo: you want to remove an element that hasn't been added to the DOM yet?
[09:22:31] <someprimetime> in that string for $test?
[09:22:40] <LordThumper> Grexeo: No I don't think you can.
[09:22:44] <someprimetime> not possible unless you parse the string
[09:22:47] <[MAN]> I have tried to remove ui overlay div
[09:22:51] <someprimetime> but why would you want to do that?
[09:22:51] <LordThumper> Grexeo: var foo = $("<div/>");
[09:23:00] <LordThumper> $(foo).remove() has no effect
[09:23:03] <someprimetime> +1 on $('<div />')
[09:23:41] <someprimetime> Eviltwin has an interesting way of adding elements as well if you're interested: $("<div>",{class:'someclass", left:"30px"});
[09:23:44] <LordThumper> .remove() detaches the element from DOM
[09:24:53] <Grexeo> someprimetime, LordThumper: I'm trying to strip <script> tags from an ajax html response
[09:25:06] <rhino_> hey guys, I created the following jquery regex, but its not actually limiting the number of characters.  What am I doing wrong?  /(?=.*[1-9])\d[1-9]{1,2}(?:\.\d{1,2})$/
[09:25:50] <LordThumper> Grexeo: Try $(htmlResponse).find("script").contents().unwrap()
[09:25:53] <someprimetime> you can do a find() on the result e.g. $(data.response).find('span') or whatever
[09:26:02] <gnarf> [MAN]: tbh - addthis was a nightmare last time i had to debug something with it
[09:26:13] <someprimetime> err yeah LordThumper's is a more thorough answer there :p
[09:26:29] <gnarf> [MAN]: it might help if you can get the jsfiddle accurately reproducing the issue
[09:26:41] <someprimetime> rhino_: limiting the # of characters for what exactly?
[09:27:44] <[MAN]> gnarf: I will try remove addthis, but stay with html generated by it to investigate this
[09:27:44] <rhino_> someprimetime:  I'm trying to limit the # of characters before the decimal point to 1 or 2 and the # of characters after the decimal point to 1 or 2
[09:28:27] <dogarrhea2> what kind of syntax is $closure();
[09:28:36] <rhino_> someprimetime:  any ideas?
[09:29:23] <rhino_> Cork:  any ideas
[09:29:35] <someprimetime> rhino_: tbh i suck with regex
[09:29:40] <someprimetime> sorry :|
[09:34:41] <nanicoar> speaking of regex and sucking
[09:35:40] <nanicoar> .replace(/ -/g, '') works, but .replace(/\//g, '') does not.
[09:36:25] <mobedigg> Hello, I for selecting element with exactly 2 classes we use .class1.class2, but how to select element exactly without second class?
[09:36:27] <nanicoar> And I dunno why. =o
[09:37:20] <nanicoar> .eq(1) magic, perhaps
[09:39:35] <danzik17> mobedigg: $( ".class1" ).not( ".class2" )
[09:40:16] <mobedigg> danzik17: thanks, I was thinking about .class1.not(class2)
[09:53:43] <Slugge> ive got a file that sets var $session = true; when the user successfully logs on, and in another file i use that var to do if($session == true){}
[09:54:04] <Slugge> but it will not work, when i reload the site it still takes me back to the login sheet
[09:54:16] <Slugge> which should be hidden based on whether session is true or not
[09:55:07] <Slugge> so im wondering if it is because the variable can not be loaded by another script
[09:57:10] <Jon47> Slugge: this is in javascript right?
[09:57:12] <someprimetime> are you actually setting a cookie with it?
[09:57:27] <Slugge> im not setting a cookie with it, and yes this is in javascript
[09:57:29] <Jon47> it won't be preserved when you reload the page if it's a variable scoped to the window
[09:57:30] <someprimetime> your app isn't going to maintain it's "state" if reloaded unless you actually set something in the history/cookie/session
[09:57:55] <Slugge> ok so im guessing setting a session variable instead will solve it then
[09:58:04] <someprimetime> without it, your app is just an etch-a-sketch getting shaken on each reload
[09:58:19] <someprimetime> Slugge: what backend language are you using? a Session is usually recommended
[09:58:40] <Slugge> plain php
[09:59:28] <Slugge> so if i set a session variable and make javascript check if thats true of false i could solve the problem?
[10:00:14] <someprimetime> yeah you'll have to do some ajax, but that'll be doable
[10:00:57] <someprimetime> well you'd use php to check if the session exists, though
[10:01:18] <someprimetime> and js to just return a string of true or false and then decide how to handle that in your view
[10:01:40] <Disil> With the class selector, how should I match <span class="last firstlevel">? $('span.last firstlevel') is 'returning empty. I think it's because of the space.
[10:01:57] <Slugge> http://pastebin.com/Dp0hfF5N <-- the current php script im running that already parses a json to the ajax script
[10:08:11] <someprimetime> Slugge: yeah you'd just do something similar to this http://jsfiddle.net/X2T8r/
[10:08:14] <someprimetime> just reload the page
[10:08:53] <someprimetime> unless you want to redirect them to a super secret user page then you just pass back some json with success : true, redirectUrl : /whatever/blah/blah
[10:09:07] <shoky> Disil: $('span.last.firstlevel')
[10:09:42] <Disil> Thanks. That worked.
[10:10:01] <Disil> Except it broke the rest of the menu, but that's something else xP
[10:10:50] <LordThumper> Grexeo: The method I gave you earlier probably executes the script, because of the way jQuery works
[10:11:01] <LordThumper> Grexeo: Use this to avoid script being executed: http://jsfiddle.net/Z6kgx/1/
[10:11:06] <someprimetime> Slugge: your php is pretty clean but i'd recommend checking out an MVC based framework to do most of this crap so you don't have to worry about it but that's another issue
[10:13:05] <Progster> am I able to completely replace the styling of a radio button in CSS? I'm trying to present 3 buttons (which are images) to the user, and have him select one. I've seen button groups in bootstrap which I believe are similar in function, but wanted to know if styling radio buttons would be easier. I'd prefer a non-js solution but dunno if it's possible
[10:14:03] <Grexeo> LordThumper: thanks, appreciated :)
[10:18:59] <Slugge> is there a way to make .load('file.php') not replace the content?
[10:19:16] <Slugge> so i can add a .php file into <head> without everything else dissapears
[10:19:20] <shoky> Slugge: use $.get instead..
[10:19:27] <shoky> or $.ajax
[10:19:37] <shoky> oh, what.
[10:22:05] <Slugge> i could create an empty div to load it in, but was hoping i could load it into head without replace the html thats already there
[10:23:11] <shoky> Progster: you can style the <label> instead
[10:28:31] <shoky> Progster: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/yvf5m/
[10:53:04] <Dr4g> I'm trying to disable the page anchor (window.location.hash) entry from jumping to an element when the page is loaded. I have a custom $.scrollTo() animation that should kick in, but I can't seem to stop the standard anchor from jumping down the page.
[10:53:17] <Dr4g> I've looked extensively on google and I can't get anything to work.
[10:57:26] <ak> Dr4g: i'm not sure this is possible
[10:58:50] <tash> i've done some googling but can't find what I'm looking for. Using the DataTables plugin and trying to setup server-side processing.  Since my HTML table includes columns not fetched from the DB, when I do server-side processing the table is missing data for 3 columns.  Anyone used this plugin with server-side before?
[10:59:14] <mikepj> Dr4g: does listening to the hashchange event and calling preventDefault work?
[10:59:28] <Dr4g> mikepj: i'll try that, thanks.
[10:59:55] <ak> Dr4g: also maybe try thisone: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3659072/jquery-disable-anchor-jump-when-loading-a-page
[11:00:22] <Dr4g> Perhaps I could cancel the default and then run my own :)
[11:00:24] <Slugge> http://jsfiddle.net/KZKzQ/ <-- im trying to get this to work, but it seems that the php wont recognize the "session" that is sent
[11:00:31] <Dr4g> I'll try onhashchange event first, stand by!
[11:02:45] <tash> Slugge: isn't that a question for #php?
[11:02:57] <tash> maybe not, but seems like the php bit is what you are having issues with.
[11:03:13] <Dr4g> mikepj: onhashchange doesn't trigger upon page load :-)
[11:03:29] <Dr4g> I will try the suggestion from ak - to disable the default and then run my own.
[11:03:47] <Slugge> tash: im unsure where im having trouble so i tried here :)
[11:03:57] <tash> ah, gotcha
[11:04:07] <tash> what debugging have you done? I bet this is a #php question
[11:04:34] <Slugge> ive TRIED to echo out what $_POST gives me, but with no luck
[11:04:58] <Slugge> so im guessing its not recieving the data at all, thats why im sensing its the ajax bit
[11:05:12] <geekie> Slugge: try var_dumping what $_POST gives you.
[11:05:20] <geekie> Then you should probably get an empty array.
[11:06:00] <Slugge> getting "null" yeh
[11:06:11] <geekie> Null means there's NO post.
[11:06:35] <geekie> An empty post should var_Dump an empty array.
[11:07:21] <geekie> As far as I know
[11:07:26] * geekie checks so she's not lying
[11:07:52] <Dr4g> ak - mikepj, i solved it with this: https://gist.github.com/acf1969b035ea97edb26
[11:08:27] <ak> Dr4g: looks good
[11:08:30] <mikepj> cool
[11:08:45] <Slugge> well, it actually seems that the session.php file doesnt recieve the post at all
[11:09:06] <geekie> Sure the path is correct?
[11:09:27] <Slugge> ya
[11:09:58] <Dr4g> o/ geekie
[11:10:02] <Slugge> http://jsfiddle.net/KZKzQ/1/ <-- heres the entire javascript, and as u can see i use same path for another file earlier in the script
[11:10:09] <Slugge> and that file works correctly
[11:10:56] <geekie> Hai Dr4g :)
[11:11:08] <Slugge> and console doesnt give any errors so im at a miss atm
[11:11:51] <geekie> Ok Slugge I would take this part by part. First ensure that the file is at least called (every time SOMETHING is there write a line in a file or so)
[11:11:54] <geekie> then go on from there.
[11:13:59] <Dr4g> ak: mikepj here's it working :) http://www.ppi.io/docs/modules.html#routing
[11:14:11] <Dr4g> canceling browser default anchor, and animating to the right position :)
[11:14:24] <someprimetime> Slugge: in your code you have data.success being either true or false
[11:14:28] <someprimetime> the original php you showed me
[11:14:38] <someprimetime> actually nm
[11:14:44] <someprimetime> that'll work properly
[11:14:46] <someprimetime> lol
[11:15:35] <someprimetime> i'm just used to explicitly saying data.success === true . don't mind me :o
[11:19:09] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Without using the <form> tag how can I send POSt data while opening a new tab where the POST data is heading?
[11:19:51] <brutal_chaos> can regexp be used with the :contains() selector?
[11:22:40] <Kambfhase> brutal_chaos: no, but you can use .filter()
[11:23:40] <bitglue> i'm trying to select a particular cell in a table that's under given row and column headers. If I select the <tr> with the table headers, can I find the index of one with a particular value?
[11:24:07] <bitglue> I'm thinking then I can select the row of interest, and use .eq() to get the cell of interest
[11:25:12] <johnkpaul> ?index @bitglue
[11:25:12] <bot-t> bitglue, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[11:26:51] <brutal_chaos> Kambfhase: excellent, thanks
[11:27:04] <Kambfhase> np
[11:28:07] <bitglue> johnkpaul: perfect, thanks
[11:28:31] <johnkpaul> no problem bitglue
[11:35:24] <Slugge> ok so now after some fiddeling ive come a bit further, but the response i get is: {"success":true}true
[11:35:33] <Slugge> and it should be without the last true
[11:39:31] <Qiller> hi ppl, can i set autostart using this sample slider? http://pastie.org/4581988
[11:42:28] <Kambfhase> Qiller: please indent your code properly. when in doubt, use http://jsbeautifier.org/
[11:44:06] <Qiller> Kambfhase: i need autostart this code
[11:44:26] <Qiller> it isnt plugin
[12:00:07] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I'm trying to print some stuff to a label printer, that won't print out HTML documents. When I change the header to text/plain it works though. I want this page to also automatically print, which I assume has to be done using the JS call. If a page is in text/plain, I'm assuming it's not going to parse/run any JS. Anybody know how I should tackle this?
[12:03:01] <MZAWeb> DeltaHeavy|Work: not tested, and probably doesn't work... but did you try jQuery("body").text().print();
[12:03:51] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Instead of changing the header?
[12:04:11] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I had an html document that just contained 'this is a test' with no HTML or anything. It didn't print
[12:05:22] <DeltaHeavy|Work> brb one sec
[12:09:41] <Progster> shoky: wow that's perfect!
[12:18:05] <gilligan_> evening
[12:22:49] <lancealtar> afternoon
[12:25:26] <evasivx> afternoon
[12:25:29] <johnkpaul> good night
[12:25:52] <gilligan_> question on jQuery animate() : the optional callback method that can be specified is called when the animation is 'complete' - it is however also called if an animation terminates early : for example if you animate an mouse-over effect and move the mouse away during the animation.  There doesn't seem to be a generic way to find out if an animation was complete in the sense that it iterated until the specified css property value has indeed
[12:25:52] <gilligan_>  been reached. Any suggestions on that ?  (Of course I can manually check the css property in my callback function)
[12:27:15] <johnkpaul> gilligan_: depends on how you stop the mouseover animation
[12:27:29] <ak> gilligan_: try using .stop()
[12:27:31] <johnkpaul> I'm pretty sure if you call stop(true, true) then the after animation callbacks will fire
[12:28:20] <gilligan_> johnkpaul, well it /does/ fire .. that is not the issue.
[12:29:19] <johnkpaul> oh, sorry, I didn't read your question carefully
[12:29:26] <johnkpaul> you want to know if the animation was completed early or not
[12:29:32] <mikepj> i remember reading that animate was going to return promises
[12:29:35] <mikepj> is that for 1.9?
[12:29:55] <RWOverdijk> I need a term for something that contains content. In a user interface, I have a menu bar in the bottom, and when clicking an item, some "box" slides up from under it with content. I was thinking like "tray" or "dock" but I don't know. Any ideas?
[12:30:27] <ak> RWOverdijk: container ;)
[12:30:28] <gilligan_> ah right .. think i stumbled over something about animate returning promises iirc
[12:30:47] <RWOverdijk> ak: But I need it for method names. "container" is too global of a term.
[12:30:53] <RWOverdijk> I want to give it a name
[12:31:34] <ak> slidupcontainer ... ah i'm very bad with names
[12:31:58] <mikepj> call it bob
[12:32:12] <johnkpaul> mikepj: no that has happened
[12:32:15] <johnkpaul> even in 1.7 I believe
[12:32:18] <mikepj> haha
[12:32:21] <mikepj> oh
[12:32:24] <mikepj> oh
[12:32:28] <mikepj> i thought so
[12:32:54] <johnkpaul> but that doesn't help gilligan_, I don't know how from a complete callback to check where the state of the animation is
[12:33:02] <johnkpaul> I'm surprised that if you stop() that it's calling the complte callback
[12:33:07] <RWOverdijk> ak: slideUpContainer hmm... I called it slideDock first, then I called it slideTray. I like slideUpContainer sort of
[12:33:33] <ak> gilligan_: if you want to make a back and forth animation, i would suggest to use $(thing).animate(..., function(){ $(thing).stop().animate( back animation )})
[12:34:22] <ak> if this makes any sense...
[12:34:29] <gilligan_> ak: it does
[12:34:56] <Norbo11> Is there an easy way of showing an element right next to another element?
[12:35:20] <mikepj> .next('element')
[12:35:29] <RWOverdijk> ak: It's like, those "feedback" buttons. You click it, and something slides out where you can do something. Or, with IDE's, you have like icons left, and in netbeans there's "projects". when you click it, a "box" comes out with content. All items have the same looking box, just different content.
[12:35:32] <mikepj> or .closest
[12:36:03] <johnkpaul> ?after @Norbo11
[12:36:04] <bot-t> Norbo11, .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[12:36:18] <Norbo11> This isn't what i meant
[12:36:22] <Norbo11> I meant on the page
[12:36:26] <ak> RWOverdijk: i think that would be a "dock"
[12:36:41] <RWOverdijk> dock sounds fine
[12:36:49] <johnkpaul> Norbo11: you mean open an element right next to something, absolutely positioned?
[12:36:49] <RWOverdijk> Then I don't have to refactor
[12:36:50] <RWOverdijk> :p
[12:36:53] <johnkpaul> there are tooltip plugins that do that
[12:36:58] <Norbo11> john3909: yes
[12:37:01] <Norbo11> erm
[12:37:05] <Norbo11> johnkpaul*
[12:37:22] <johnkpaul> Norbo11: look for a jquery tooltip plugin that lets you supply your own element
[12:37:42] <johnkpaul> Norbo11: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/
[12:38:09] <Norbo11> ok ty
[12:43:02] <t432> i can reference the following input field - "<form:input path="foo"  />" doing "$("#message :path")" #message being the form id
[12:43:13] <t432> right?
[12:43:30] <ak> <form:input is wtf :)
[12:43:31] <johnkpaul> t432: what templating system is this?
[12:43:36] <johnkpaul> jstl?
[12:43:42] <t432> yes
[12:43:44] <johnkpaul> path, maybe that's the spring libraries
[12:43:49] <johnkpaul> oh ok, damn, I havent' seen JSTL in years
[12:43:49] <t432> spring to be precise
[12:43:53] <johnkpaul> ha! I was right
[12:43:55] <johnkpaul> hilarious
[12:43:58] <Norbo11> Anyone know how I would go about adding JQuery support to Aptana/
[12:44:13] <johnkpaul> so t432, no, you can't lookup by :path, that's not a valid css selector
[12:44:23] <johnkpaul> I forget what path produces in terms of names
[12:44:43] <ak> $('#message[path="foo"]')
[12:44:49] <ak> would work
[12:44:56] <johnkpaul> you'll have to look at the output on the page, it's something like $("#message[name=message\.foo")
[12:45:04] <johnkpaul> no ak, path doesn't show up in the source
[12:45:09] <johnkpaul> path is for the templating library he's using
[12:45:13] <ak> oh okay
[12:45:32] <johnkpaul> http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/spring-form.tld.html
[12:46:16] <t432> can i find out using http live header?
[12:46:19] <fission61> how would i convert a json string to an object
[12:46:27] <NexHD> hi
[12:46:39] <ak> fission61: $.parseJSON()
[12:47:02] <fission61> ok - i am serializing a json string to a form input so i need to load it and modify it
[12:47:04] <johnkpaul> t432: just view source on the spring generated page
[12:47:12] <johnkpaul> or use your web developer tools to inspect the input field
[12:47:42] <NexHD> i want to ask why this is not work http://jsfiddle.net/insetpixel/DCg8x/ ?
[12:48:19] <fission61> ak is there a better way to read an input type text which is a json string?
[12:48:37] <johnkpaul> NexHD: adding a click handler doesnts' return a boolean
[12:49:11] <NexHD> but i do to remove a element from the dom?
[12:49:12] <ak> var jsonObject = $.parseJSON( $('input#myid').val() )  < fission61
[12:49:35] <fission61> nice thats wjat i did
[12:49:37] <fission61> sweet
[12:49:39] <johnkpaul> NexHD: .remove()
[12:49:46] <johnkpaul> not remove;
[12:50:35] <NexHD> thanks
[12:51:00] <fission61> is there a nice way to find all keys in a hash map that have start with a certain string and change their values?
[12:51:02] <johnkpaul> np NexHD
[12:51:36] <johnkpaul> fission61: js doesn't have "hashmaps" ;) you can use Object.keys from the ES5 shim to find all of the keys of an object
[12:51:52] <johnkpaul> actually, no
[12:51:54] <johnkpaul> ?each @fission61
[12:51:54] <bot-t> fission61, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:52:07] <johnkpaul> wrong link http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[12:53:26] <johnkpaul> fission61: jQuery.each(yourObj, function(key,value){if (keyStartsWithWhatever}{//do whatever}))
[12:54:04] <fission61> right but whats best for the keyStartsWithWhatever
[12:54:20] <ak> .match maybe
[12:54:38] <ak> or .test
[12:55:00] <shoky> $.grep
[12:55:31] <shoky> actually no, sry
[12:55:39] <fission61> illr eview
[12:55:39] <johnkpaul> that doesn't work with strings
[12:55:47] <johnkpaul> fission61: indexOf is the _right_ solution
[12:55:51] <fission61> let me get soem code in place
[12:55:51] <johnkpaul> but in old IE's it's unavailable
[12:56:03] <johnkpaul> you can use the ES5 shim to add it
[12:56:05] <johnkpaul> ok, fission61
[12:57:15] <ak> what's wrong with testing a regexp? :)
[12:57:24] <ak> i would go with it...
[12:58:18] <helllen> helllo
[12:58:30] <johnkpaul> ak: nothing is wrong with it, just so annoying imho
[12:59:01] <helllen> I am using sortable component. How can I know the new position the object is dropped ?
[13:00:09] <fission61> then do get an object back to a string, would i use JSON.stringify()
[13:03:15] <thinkt4nk> helllen http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#event-stop
[13:03:31] <thinkt4nk> inspect the event for the position
[13:04:19] <helllen> I have used stopped event already
[13:04:26] <thinkt4nk> ok
[13:04:51] <helllen> the problem is I don't know how to get the dropped position from event  or ui variables
[13:05:07] <ak> helllen: if you provide a jsfiddle i can take a look
[13:05:26] <bitglue> how could i select all the td or tr of a particular column of a table?
[13:05:36] <bitglue> i mean, all the td or th
[13:06:20] <bitglue> the idea being ultimately to remove the column
[13:06:24] <ak> $('trselector').find('td, th')
[13:06:42] <thinkt4nk> ak I think he's asking about the column, not the row
[13:06:58] <thinkt4nk> bitglue are you building the table, or does some other bit of code do that?
[13:07:05] <ak> hmm
[13:07:17] <gilligan_> hm.. sorry in advance for an somewhat unrelated noob question but .. can't the chrome debugger trigger breakpoints on a conditional statement ? 'watch expressions' works fine for evaluating an expression .. but i was hoping i could break once such expression is true :-)
[13:07:24] <helllen> ak, http://pastebin.com/7n17ZznH
[13:07:33] <bitglue> thinkt4nk: i'm building it
[13:07:41] <NexHD> can somebody help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/insetpixel/DCg8x/1/ when i click in the box and i click outside she show me the error and i have an if condition to remove a class when is click in the box ... but when click outside again i want to show that error class again...can someone help me???
[13:08:43] <thinkt4nk> bitglue I was going to suggest building the table with metadata on the td/th's to distinguish it from the other columns' td's/th's, but there's likely something more elegant
[13:08:58] <fission61> anyone want to comment on my code - i think its working, testing now but curious if it can be refined http://dpaste.org/CpiOM/
[13:09:22] <thinkt4nk> get the index of the column in question, then grab every tr's th and td with that index
[13:09:24] <thinkt4nk> ?
[13:09:43] <ak> thinkt4nk: sounds like nth child thing
[13:09:56] <thinkt4nk> right
[13:09:56] <bitglue> i think maybe i can do it with :eq
[13:10:40] <bitglue> it gets very confusing keeping :eq and .index and this and that straight...is it the index into the order of the element to its parent? of the jquery object's set? 0 based? 1 based?
[13:10:44] * bitglue 's head spins
[13:10:49] <ak> helllen: can you give me a bit more code? :) jsfiddle would be nice, if i have the running code, i can take a look at the event..
[13:11:33] <Kambfhase> bitglue: look at the docs ;)
[13:11:45] <thinkt4nk> eq is the element from the jquery object set
[13:11:55] <NexHD> ak can you help me?
[13:12:28] <Kambfhase> thinkt4nk: well if used as a selector :eq() is relative to the parent.
[13:12:32] <Kambfhase> iirc
[13:12:51] <shoky> its simplest with :nth-child
[13:13:10] <shoky> e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/RQp7T/
[13:13:24] <shoky> ah ak said it
[13:14:12] <Kambfhase> wow, didnt even know jQ supported nth-child since evar
[13:16:55] <fission61> any reviews?
[13:18:22] <ravenzz> Kambfhase actually you can do that in css as well
[13:19:10] <Kambfhase> well i knew that its in css, just didnt know that jQ (Sizzle) implemented it
[13:19:24] <Kambfhase> I've always used :eq :frst etc. for that
[13:20:01] <ravenzz> uh lol
[13:20:56] <ravenzz> don't use presentational classnames btw
[13:21:03] <ak> bitglue: http://jsfiddle.net/9hjRH/1/  if you would need it...
[13:22:19] <ak> fission61: if it works, it's good enough
[13:28:14] <bitglue> mmmh. my table is missing a border, somehow.
[13:30:21] <bitglue> seems to be a consequence of collapsed table borders :(
[13:30:28] <bitglue> and, nifty animations
[13:30:56] <Kambfhase> May be its a liberal table. It signed the Schengen Agreement
[13:32:30] <fission61> tight
[13:32:42] <fission61> ak but its reasonable code
[13:35:16] <Kambfhase> Damn, spilled my Gin Tonic.
[13:40:34] <bitglue> does firefox have some color picker tool so i can twiddle colors in css until they look good?
[13:40:58] <bitglue> i can edit the css in firebug, but picking colors by hex value is tedious
[13:41:23] <johnkpaul> bitglue: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firepicker/
[13:41:59] <NexHD> is correct this code ? if(($("#fname").val().match(/^[A-Z][a-z]{4,15}$/)
[13:42:02] <NexHD> ?
[13:42:14] <Kambfhase> NexHD: what is it supposed to do?
[13:42:32] <johnkpaul> NexHD: you're missing some parens
[13:42:37] <Kambfhase> NexHD: use .test()
[13:42:41] <bitglue> johnkpaul: awesome. Now, is there one that will endow me with designer ability?
[13:42:49] <NexHD> to match that value from a input
[13:43:21] <johnkpaul> bitglue: a FF extension, no, but there's this total recall thing taht everyone's talking about
[13:50:54] <Johnsen> Hi! I was wondering if it was possible to "reassign" the $ to jQuery()? My page loads jquery, plusone.js and then tries to execute $(document).ready which leads toa $ is not defined error.
[13:51:51] <johnkpaul> Johnsen: you _could_ just add a line $ = jQuery above your document.ready, but that would break whatever was using $
[13:52:22] <johnkpaul> it's preferrable to wrap your document.readys with (function($){ // your code goes here })(jQuery)
[13:52:47] <Kambfhase> jQuery(function($) (/* $ is now jQ */ });
[13:53:27] <johnkpaul> Kambfhase's method is equivalent to document.ready, so everything inside will defer being run until domready
[13:53:29] <Kambfhase> johnkpaul: no need for the extra wrap, the first argument to a ready handler is jQuery
[13:53:46] <johnkpaul> Kambfhase: you're assuming that everything Johnsen needs to do is inside domready
[13:54:08] <Kambfhase> yeah.
[13:54:43] <johnkpaul> if that's not the case, and there is code that can run before domready, and you need jQuery there, you need to use the IIFE
[13:54:51] <Johnsen> Thanks for the help! Both replys have been helpful. Now i just have to find out why jQuery is completly unkown after plusone.js loads... but i guess that's not jquery related. :)
[13:55:06] <johnkpaul> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[13:55:12] <johnkpaul> Johnsen: :) probably not
[13:55:14] <johnkpaul> what is plusone.js?
[13:56:01] <Johnsen> a google plus js file which is responsible for a google plus button display.
[13:56:38] <johnkpaul> oh, I see Johnsen
[13:56:53] <johnkpaul> I'm really surprised that they mess with jQuery or $
[13:58:18] <Johnsen> I don't really think that's the case. I'm probably missing something ... and that page is a mess so it's no wonder.
[14:00:27] <rgr> whats the correct selector for something all Divs whose display css is not "none"?
[14:01:41] <luckysmack> anyone in here using jquery tools? the scrollable part. I am looking for a way to not let users be able to use the [TAB] key to go to the next page
[14:02:36] <johnkpaul> rgr: $("div").filter(function(){return $(this).css('display') != "none";})
[14:03:16] <rgr> thanks, thats makes sense, but I realised I can use :visible in my use case too. thanks.
[14:04:16] <Kambfhase> ?visible @ rgr
[14:04:17] <bot-t> rgr, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[14:04:27] * Kambfhase too slow
[14:05:08] <rgr> ;) visible is subtely different but actually ok for my use.
[14:20:59] <Sean-Der> What is the best way to fetch data from a foreign service? I have an API that I wan't to work with client side, but XSS protection is stopping me
[14:21:32] <ryanneufeld> Sean-Der: you'll likely need to use jsonp
[14:21:44] <ryanneufeld> ?jsonp
[14:21:44] <bot-t> JSONP, Quickly ¬´ plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[14:22:10] <Sean-Der> ryanneufeld: Does the server have to offer it? Or can it take plaintext
[14:22:19] <Sean-Der> Sorry will read the links
[14:22:24] <ryanneufeld> Server has to offer it
[14:22:47] <Sean-Der> Crud :/
[14:23:10] <ryanneufeld> other wise you can proxy it through your own server
[14:25:25] <Sean-Der> I don't know if that will be an option for me. I am messing around with PhoneGap and seeing if it will work with a pre-existing product. I am gonna explore the proxy option
[14:26:15] <ravenzz> what is the api in question?
[14:28:00] <Sean-Der> ravenzz: Its a proprietary one that my job has. I don't know any Microsoft stack stuff, but its offered as 'SOAP 1.1, SOAP 1.2, POST && GET'
[14:28:33] <Sean-Der> So I was just messing around and seeing if I could make something with PhoneGap really quick to make something with it
[14:29:08] <ColKurtz> what format is the data Sean-Der ?
[14:29:51] <Sean-Der> XML
[14:30:58] <Sean-Der> Well this is cool! PhoneGap actually can make cross domain calls
[14:31:30] <ravenzz> I don't know what it is but
[14:31:46] <ravenzz> if is an app, exension, os library
[14:31:52] <ravenzz> it can
[14:32:34] <Beeton> hi there, I'd like to retrieve an HTML string, interpret it into DOM elements, then append part of it (eg first <p>) to a document
[14:32:41] <Sean-Der> ravenzz: Yea this was my mistake I was testing in FireFox and Chrome and didn't double check if I actually could do XSS stuff
[14:33:31] <Beeton> so far I have something like x = $('<div><p>asdf</p><p>zxcv</p></div>'). Can I think query x to retrieve just the first <p>?
[14:33:51] <ravenzz> yes
[14:34:12] <Beeton> *then, not think
[14:34:21] <ravenzz> ?eval var x = $('<div><p>asdf</p><p>zxcv</p></div>'); x.find('p').length;
[14:34:24] <bot-t> ravenzz: TypeError: div is undefined
[14:35:08] <ravenzz> ?eval var x = $('<div><p>asdf</p><p>zxcv</p></div>'); console.log(x.find('p').length);
[14:35:09] <bot-t> ravenzz: TypeError: div is undefined
[14:35:11] <ravenzz> ok
[14:35:12] <Beeton> ah great, thanks ravenzz! :)
[14:35:16] <ravenzz> I doesn't eval jQuery
[14:35:33] <ravenzz> but that's how you are supposed to do that
[14:37:16] <ravenzz> Beeton if you are going to retrieve the HTML with an ajax request you can use $('#results').load('foo.html #whatever');
[14:37:36] <Beeton> oh cool, thanks that sounds even better

[14:37:59] <mightym> hey guys, I've a strange problem. is use animate() on an element. if i use console.log for its callback, al works fine. but if i use this function http://pastie.org/4582806 for the callback the animation seems not to be executed ( or just a part of it). someone a hint for me?
[14:40:37] <matteu> mightym: you mean the page redirects before the animation finishes?
[14:41:53] <mightym> matteu: actually my animation moves an element for 200px, but it seems it redirects after ~10px
[14:42:21] <matteu> mightym: Show me the full animation call with callback
[14:43:28] <mightym> matteu: http://pastie.org/4582844
[14:49:51] <matteu> mightym: It works for me in Firefox 15
[14:50:03] <matteu> 14*
[14:50:40] <matteu> mightym: the code that you pasted doesn't have a semicolon after checkLanguage, that's the only thing I changed
[14:50:48] <mightym> matteu: maybe its a webkit problem, cause I've to build the site for safari only
[14:51:01] <matteu> mightym: maybe
[14:51:05] <mightym> matteu: ok, ill try that too
[14:51:16] <gleison> guys how to get all elements html?
[14:51:28] <gleison> <div id="test"><tr><td><p>LOL</p></td></tr></div>
[14:51:33] <gleison> $('#test').html();
[14:51:37] <gleison> return
[14:51:41] <gleison> "<p>LOL</p>"
[14:51:42] <mightym> matteu: thx anyway for your kind help
[14:51:53] <gleison> not <tr><td><p>LOL</p></td></tr>
[14:52:19] <gleison> ??
[14:52:47] <matteu> gleison: jQuery('#test *')
[14:52:57] <matteu> gleison: please read the api section on selectors
[14:53:04] <gleison> sorry man
[14:53:07] <gleison> thx
[14:53:17] <matteu> gleison: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[14:53:27] <gleison> need all elements
[14:53:34] <gleison> need tr and tds
[14:53:51] <sonotos> gleison: why do you have tr/td in a div?
[14:54:04] <gleison> a template
[14:54:56] <sonotos> gleison: hm i see
[14:55:24] <gleison> :)
[14:55:35] <matteu> gleison: jQuery('#test *') is a selector which means every element under #test
[14:56:21] <matteu> gleison: please note that the * selector is comparatively very slow, except when used by itself
[14:56:55] <gleison> I see
[14:57:12] <gleison> but return <p>LOL</p>
[14:57:23] <sonotos> gleison: i use normaly <script type="text/html" id="test"><tr><td><p>LOL</p></td></tr></script> for templates
[14:58:27] <Beeton> I'm having trouble with remove - I have an element with a bunch of children in a variable, and I want to take out all <sup> elements. x.remove('sup') doesn't do anything though
[14:58:28] <Beeton> any ideas?
[14:58:28] <matteu> gleison: That's probably because your browser is removing those elements
[14:58:39] <gleison> But i need <tr><td><p>LOL</p></td><tr>
[14:58:40] <matteu> gleison: Since they aren't inside a <table> element
[14:58:50] <sonotos> gleison: try text()
[14:58:51] <gleison> ya
[14:58:58] <sonotos> to get it first
[14:59:00] <gleison> text return LOL
[14:59:11] <gleison> text()
[14:59:14] <sonotos> cdata
[14:59:54] <matteu> gleison: Or try reconstructing that bit of DOM via jQuery manipulators
[14:59:58] <Beeton> ravenzz, any ideas about using remove? It doesn't seem to do anything for me
[15:00:15] <sonotos> <div id="test"><![CDATA[<tr><td><p>LOL</p></td></tr>]]></div>
[15:00:33] <sonotos> +.text()
[15:00:41] <sonotos> would be one option
[15:00:41] <gleison> .clone()
[15:01:30] <sonotos> hm would be strange if your browser removes <tr> in html but not in clone
[15:01:48] <gleison> sonotos
[15:01:53] <gleison> its nice
[15:02:01] <gleison> solution  <div id="test"><![CDATA[<tr><td><p>LOL</p></td></tr>]]></div>
[15:02:30] <gleison> return <tr><td><p>LOL</p></td></tr>
[15:02:34] <gleison> thx
[15:02:39] <gleison> very nice
[15:02:53] <sonotos> gleison: i still would propose to try it with a script tag <script type="text/html" >
[15:03:25] <gleison> Nice.
[15:03:29] <matteu> Beeton: what do you mean by 'bunch of children in a variable'?
[15:04:23] <sonotos> gleison: so i'ts always clear that this is a template and you don't have a "unessecary" div in your dom node
[15:04:31] <Beeton> I retrieved some HTML from a server, and want to modify it a bit before putting it in the page. Eg I have <div><p>asdf <strong>zxcv</strong></p></div> and I want to remove the <strong> element
[15:04:47] <Beeton> and ultimately put just <p>asdf</p> in my document
[15:04:57] <matteu> Beeton: you're editing this DOM in jQuery?
[15:05:03] <Beeton> yes
[15:05:24] <Beeton> so I started with var x = $('<div>‚Ä¶..</div>')
[15:05:42] <Beeton> but I don't seem to be able to use x.remove('strong')
[15:06:34] <dabear> .find("strong").remove()
[15:08:08] <Beeton> yeah, I'm trying x.remove('strong') but the returned variable still has the strong element
[15:08:39] <Beeton> oh wait, sorry I misread - I'll try your suggestion
[15:09:06] <Beeton> hmm, now I get only the strong element back
[15:09:16] <dabear> lol
[15:09:48] <dabear> if you do var x = ....; and then x.find("strong").remove()
[15:09:59] <dabear> x will now not contain the strong element
[15:10:57] <Beeton> oh ok, so x is modified but the strong element is returned?
[15:11:00] <Beeton> thanks, got it :)
[15:11:04] <dabear> if you do this in one line instead of two, you would have to do .end() as well
[15:12:02] <defaultr0> hi folks, need help on this code http://pastebin.com/BFDNXDkX
[15:12:08] <dabear> .remove() returns the removed element. by .end()-ing you would return the previous element instead (the selectred element)
[15:12:23] <defaultr0> this is not removing the attribute. DOM.find("input[type=file]").removeAttr("disabled");
[15:13:00] <dabear> defaultr0:  I don't see  DOM defined there
[15:13:01] <Beeton> thanks dabear, haven't come across end() before
[15:13:22] <defaultr0> it's var DOM = $(attachment);
[15:14:00] <defaultr0> should I inspect the contents of $(attachment)
[15:14:12] <dabear> yep, do that before posting here:)
[15:14:18] <defaultr0> k
[15:14:40] <imsky> hrrhnng
[15:15:03] <defaultr0> oh, it's not dynamically created, LOL
[15:15:14] <defaultr0> it was statically created above the var Dom
[15:15:18] <defaultr0> i mean, the html codes
[15:17:15] <matteu> defaultr0: what does console.log( DOM.find('input[type="file"]')) give you?
[15:18:17] <matteu> defaultr0: your lack of quotes around 'file' might be the issue
[15:18:48] <defaultr0> oh

[16:24:06] <Carlitta87> hi ...im trying to do a site fully in jquery but some of the transitions are off....is there a way to make them smoother and not look as if they are going over each other?
[16:24:16] <Carlitta87> http://demo.devmediastudios.com/kle_group/
[16:30:20] <lcb> Carlitta87: i don't have a clue on JQuery coding.. but, on Firefox 14.01 looks great
[16:33:24] <gnarf> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/24/jquery-color-2-1-0/
[16:33:42] <lcb> ...saw several pages and i didn't notice any transitions overlappings.. - not going over each other.
[16:33:59] <lcb> that's for Carlitta87
[16:34:28] <Carlitta87> lcb : only happens in safari
[16:35:22] <lcb> ohh... possible a known incompatibility?!
[16:35:43] <Carlitta87> jqueryui? incompatiable....is that even possible? lol
[16:36:30] <lcb> i don't know, i even barely know how to write :o
[16:40:42] <citric> Does .ajax() have anything in it so that I can pass data to the .success() function?

[16:50:45] <eph3meral> semi-nsfw depending on who you are, just girls in bikinis
[16:51:00] <eph3meral> anyway, my problem is, how do I prevent that overlay from flickering if your mouse is on top of it while you're moving the mouse
[16:54:21] <Francis47> eph3meral: Why do you use jquery for that=
[16:54:44] <eph3meral> Francis47: uhh, well mostly because my project uses jquery
[16:54:56] <eph3meral> so it's more idiomatic within this project to do things the "jquery way"
[16:55:00] <eph3meral> but i don't need to necessarily
[16:55:01] <systemfault> Because he doesn't understand CSS
[16:55:08] <systemfault> It's as simple as that
[16:55:40] <eph3meral> systemfault: would you care to help me understand css or are you content to simply stay mildly patronizing/condescending?
[16:55:58] <eph3meral> i thought of trying this with :hover
[16:56:05] <systemfault> That would work
[16:56:14] <systemfault> overlay needs to be in the anchor though
[16:56:28] <eph3meral> ahh, yes it would wouldn't it
[16:56:30] <systemfault> Unless you want :hover on wrapper
[16:56:44] <eph3meral> yeah that's not as compatible as :hover on the anchor though, right?
[16:56:53] <eph3meral> i do have to deal with IE
[16:56:55] <eph3meral> only 8 and up tho
[16:57:08] <Francis47> eph3meral: http://jsfiddle.net/u8CnC/3/ I updated your fiddle
[16:57:16] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/u8CnC/4/
[16:57:19] <Francis47> take a look at the simplicity of the css behind it
[16:57:19] <systemfault> Ah :P
[16:58:10] <eph3meral> hah, yes, overcomplication - i'm not usually prone to it, but i guess i am guilty once again
[16:59:07] <eph3meral> ergk‚Ä¶ i do not want to have to deal with doing this on IE :(
[16:59:23] <systemfault> eph3meral: You already did, no?
[16:59:29] <systemfault> Using the filter
[16:59:31] <Francis47> then tell your client to stuff IE8 where the sun dont shine
[16:59:36] <eph3meral> hahaha, wish i could
[16:59:48] <eph3meral> anyway, you guys are right, :hover looks like the best solution
[16:59:53] <systemfault> Only IE7 is a pain now
[17:00:03] <eph3meral> yeh i'm not actually super worried given that it's 8 and up
[17:00:18] <eph3meral> i'm sure there's gonna be some stuff that's just Not Right ‚Ñ¢
[17:00:25] <systemfault> No problem then‚Ä¶ It's painful to me to say that.. but IE8 is a fine CSS2 browser
[17:00:41] <eph3meral> yeah i've been out of the frontend world for a long time
[17:00:57] <eph3meral> i've done plenty of it, but i stay away on purpose, but good to hear that IE8 is sane with CSS2
[17:01:06] <systemfault> eph3meral: IE8 and later doesn't have the old hasLayout crap.
[17:01:11] <systemfault> *don't
[17:01:16] <Francis47> eph3meral: you should probably wrap the <a> around the "overlay" if you want it to be clickable - thats html5 though ..
[17:01:35] <eph3meral> Francis47: yeah actually there needs to be a clickable link inside the overlay
[17:01:43] <eph3meral> fuggin facebook "like" button :(
[17:01:54] <Francis47> shouldnt be a problem
[17:03:15] <Francis47> http://jsfiddle.net/u8CnC/7/
[17:04:20] <systemfault> I wish IE8 would ONLY support rgba
[17:04:25] <systemfault> It's a pain...
[17:04:48] <Francis47> i wish Internet Exploder 8 would vanish
[17:05:19] <systemfault> IE8 is Windows 7‚Ä¶ so we're stuck with it forever
[17:05:34] <systemfault> Unless MS decide to change the way they support IE
[17:06:16] <aaas> hello I have a slidetoggle that i would like to be closed by default,  currently I am running it after document.ready, but I can see the close animation after page load, is there a way to show it closed without the animation
[17:06:21] <Francis47> they strongly reccomends an upgrade to ie9 if you allow for automatic updates
[17:06:33] <Francis47> but there are still ppl afraid of updating
[17:07:05] <systemfault> Francis47: Recommend is not enough.
[17:07:19] <systemfault> Francis47: It should be an unavoidable update
[17:07:21] <Francis47> i agree
[17:08:11] <Francis47> but that would require unavoidable update settings - they cant do that, since its illegal in some countries
[17:12:18] <synapt> Anyone know why a bind('change') would stop working on 'dynamic' file uploading?  eg; using jQuery to upload through a frame (file field is hidden, to use a 'fancy' upload input), when doing the fancy 'upload' button, the change bind works, and will place the file name into the styled input field
[17:12:57] <synapt> but once it uploads, and I handle the message return and such, it will no longer work, any file selection no longer triggers the change bind, to set the .val() of the styled input.
[17:13:26] <synapt> I do issue a form reset() on a successful upload, could that be triggering it some how?  (as a failure in upload, which does not do a .reset(), does not have this issue)
[17:14:59] <RichieEvan> I like turtles
[17:24:05] <ravster> Hello everyone
[17:24:22] <ravster> How do I find out what the GET options are on a page?
[17:24:48] <iateadonut> you mean in php?
[17:25:01] <ravster> on the client-side
[17:29:58] <MZAWeb> ravster: you can't get GET, that's serverside. You can parse the current URL and deconstruct, though. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1403888/get-url-parameter-with-jquery
[17:30:12] <MZAWeb> first answer has a method that works for me
[17:30:42] <HarryPitfall> synapt: I use this code to "async" upload files... http://pastebin.com/E9wDrFQV
[17:31:04] <HarryPitfall> the return must be a json text (with text/html contenttype)
[17:31:25] <synapt> HarryPitfall: Redoing this thing is unfortunately not an option right now.  The file uploading and all works perfectly, it's just that -after- the upload (through the jQuery frame stuff) is done, suddenly the bind('change') seems to 'stop' working
[17:31:53] <synapt> and the only thing actually -different- between, a successful upload and an errored upload, is, a form reset
[17:31:55] <HarryPitfall> for msie you must bind('propertychange') of the file upload
[17:32:06] <synapt> This would be FF I'm testing on
[17:32:10] <ravster> MZAWeb: thanks, that helps.
[17:32:12] <HarryPitfall> for other browser, you must use live or on
[17:32:17] <synapt> but it's also happening in some other browsers it seems
[17:32:17] <synapt> ah
[17:32:20] <synapt> live?
[17:32:21] <HarryPitfall> form.on('change', 'input', function() { form.submit(); });
[17:32:22] <synapt> let me try that
[17:32:31] <synapt> well no the form isn't changing
[17:32:36] <huglester> guys, anyone can suggest any tools for building skeleton for jquery mobile site?
[17:32:43] <HarryPitfall> on is a live listener
[17:32:59] <HarryPitfall> this code is a live listener of change in any "input" inside the form
[17:33:19] <synapt> Basically, there's two fields, the 'normal' file input, which is an invisible layer hidden where the 'browse/upload' thing is, and the 'styled' input
[17:33:53] <synapt> all I'm trying to do is, catch when a file is 'selected' through the file input, copy it's name to the styled input via .val, eg; $('.url').val($('#files').val());
[17:34:09] <synapt> Which works fine, -until- an actual upload is done, and the form is .reset() for a new one
[17:34:15] <synapt> I'll try live() though, see if it works better over bind()
[17:39:06] <HAPPYFUNBRO> what's the method that allows you to update something on a set interval?
[17:43:22] <matteu> HAPPYFUNBRO: setTimeout
[17:43:28] <HAPPYFUNBRO> 		// setInterval(function() {
[17:43:33] <HAPPYFUNBRO> thansk thouygh
[18:09:56] <martisj> morning
[18:11:07] <ravster> $('#foo p') will select all paragraphs within the 'foo' ID div, right?
[18:12:48] <iateadonut> $('p#foo')
[18:12:55] <iateadonut> and you shouldn't have more than one element with the same id
[18:13:07] <iateadonut> so, you should be doing <p class='foo'>
[18:13:16] <iateadonut> and selecting $('p.foo') by class
[18:13:23] <iateadonut> ravster
[18:14:00] <ravster> oh, sorry. I meant all paragraphs within a div with an id of 'foo'
[18:15:04] <iateadonut> do you want only direct descendants?
[18:15:07] <iateadonut> also, TIAS
[18:15:09] <ColKurtz> so I have an attribute like data-dimensions="{ width: 640, height: 360 }"
[18:15:20] <ColKurtz> how can I access that data and read it as an object literal?
[18:15:42] <ColKurtz> I'm able to store it in a var and log it
[18:15:47] <ravster> iateadonut: yes, only children
[18:15:51] <ravster> tias?
[18:15:51] <ColKurtz> but if i try var.width it returns undefined
[18:16:06] <iateadonut> if you have firebug, you can print at the bottom, click console, and then do $(selector).css('background', 'red');, hit enter, and all that you've selected will turn red
[18:16:14] <iateadonut> Try It And See
[18:16:45] <iateadonut> ColKurtz, $.parsJSON ??? i'm not really sure, but that might be the right track
[18:17:01] <ColKurtz> looks like it's malformed
[18:18:19] <iateadonut> $('#foo p') should select all, i think; $('#foo > p') should select only direct descendants.
[18:18:49] <iateadonut> but firebug console is your friend in figuring out selectors, and the .css('background', 'red') method
[18:19:04] <ColKurtz> it needs to be like
[18:19:08] <ravster> iateadonut: oh, okay. Thanks.
[18:19:17] <ColKurtz> data-dimensions='{ width: 640, height: 360 }
[18:19:19] <ColKurtz> er
[18:19:32] <ColKurtz> data-dimensions='{ "width": 640, "height": 360 }'
[18:20:43] <iateadonut> data = $(selector).attr('data-dimensions').val();
[18:20:43] <iateadonut> alert( $.parseJSON(data).width );
[18:20:45] <iateadonut> try something like that.
[18:20:53] <iateadonut> if that's a JSON string
[18:21:45] <m41is> hi, whats the best way to let flow the content to the left out of the browser and the new content loaded over ajax, let flow in from the right?
[18:24:46] <iateadonut> probably a plugin
[18:24:59] <m41is> and which one?
[18:25:09] <iateadonut> don't know. there's lots
[18:25:14] <iateadonut> hold on.
[18:25:58] <iateadonut> http://codecanyon.net/item/ccslider-jquery-3d-slideshow-plugin/full_screen_preview/162445
[18:26:04] <iateadonut> that one is good - costs $12 to license
[18:26:45] <iateadonut> from scratch you probably want to put two divs within another div, and on a successful ajax call, populate the second div with the ajax return data and then slide it over.
[18:27:17] <m41is> wow
[18:27:21] <ColKurtz> iateadonut, thanks, I did need to use parseJSON
[18:27:36] <m41is> ok thank u
[18:27:42] <ColKurtz> there was conflicting info on stackoverflow, one post said jquery automatically treats an data- attrs starting with { as JSON
[18:29:50] <iateadonut> no problem
[18:29:55] <HAPPYFUNBRO> anyone in here interested in helping to debug an enormously complex issue with a media player?
[18:30:43] <ravster> How do I interpret a string as a JSON?
[18:31:06] <m41is> my problem is, the content is align in the center, the div is realtiv
[18:31:11] <ravster> oh, nvm. Just found parseJSON
[18:32:10] <m41is> with position: absolute i would know what to do
[18:33:58] <synapt> HarryPitfall: .live() worked, thanks much
[18:34:33] <iateadonut> something like this: $("#animation_title").animate({"left": "+=800px"}
[18:34:52] <iateadonut> m41is
[18:35:09] <HarryPitfall> synapt: is a know issue that input type=file is problematic
[18:35:19] <HarryPitfall> browsers unbind the events
[18:35:23] <HarryPitfall> for security reasons
[18:35:43] <HarryPitfall> msie is very harsh about file uploads targeting a iframe...
[18:36:05] <HarryPitfall> basically, you get "access denied" if the input isn't filled by a direct click of the user
[18:36:29] <m41is> iateadonut: i know but the div is realive
[18:36:35] <m41is> rlative
[18:36:40] <m41is> relative
[18:39:01] <iateadonut> alright, well, still works on mine.
[18:39:02] <iateadonut> so
[18:39:38] <iateadonut> in that case, #animation_title is contained within #animation_div
[18:39:58] <HAPPYFUNBRO> NEVERMIND I AM THE GREATEST BRO WHO EVER BROED!
[18:42:31] <iateadonut> SWEET!
[18:50:48] <synapt> HarryPitfall: Yeah the unbinding issue is what I was getting, live() fixed it though
[19:35:47] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. Looking for a little help. I'm using iscroll and trying to make a scrolling div work just a little more smoothly on the iphone/ipad. I have it working and active but its not scrolling, its just bouncing and springing back to place. The demo site is here: http://bscdeveloper.com/millwrights (you have to view with user agent on iPhone and best to have screen small)
[19:36:14] <LindsayMac> To replicate browse to the "about" page and click and drag and you will see what would happen if you used it on a touch device
[19:37:45] <LindsayMac> any help is HUGELY appreciated.. i know its friday night.. not many people around..
[19:37:47] <devslash> is there a way to set a breakpoint in firebug
[19:38:01] <LindsayMac> devslash: i believe you can do it in the console
[19:38:07] <devslash> how
[19:38:16] <devslash> I'm trying to click next to the line number but nothing happens
[19:38:44] <LindsayMac> trying to remember..
[19:38:47] <coldhead> hi LindsayMac
[19:38:53] <LindsayMac> hey there coldhead
[19:39:17] <shoky> devslash: in scripts tab
[19:39:33] <devslash> my javascript is contained within my html file
[19:39:47] <shoky> that's ok
[19:39:51] <shoky> in scripts tab
[19:39:55] <LindsayMac> devslash:  click on SCRIPTS and then on the right you will see BREAKPOINTS
[19:40:00] <devslash> ok
[19:40:04] <devslash> then what
[19:40:13] <shoky> devslash: then click on the line number
[19:40:16] <devslash> I'm using firebug lite
[19:40:17] <LindsayMac> along the top is a little drop down where you choose which js file you want to look at
[19:40:26] <LindsayMac> why?
[19:40:29] <devslash> my code doesn't appear there
[19:40:33] <shoky> devslash: oh. i imagine it'd be the same there but no idea
[19:40:42] <devslash> is there a firebug that isn't lite for chrome
[19:40:44] <LindsayMac> what do you mean your code doesnt appear?
[19:40:58] <LindsayMac> Ohhh chrome...
[19:41:05] <shoky> wtf
[19:41:10] <shoky> devslash: don't use firebug in chrome..
[19:41:16] <LindsayMac> why not just use the dev tools?
[19:41:28] <devslash> the built in tools
[19:41:47] <shoky> yes, they're just as good if not better than firebug
[19:42:09] <tw2113> especially to chrome fans
[19:42:28] <LindsayMac> yea..
[19:42:35] <shoky> that's true in any field..
[19:42:36] <LindsayMac> although hard to get used to if you use firebug!!
[19:42:39] <devslash> i don't see how you add  a breakpoint
[19:43:01] <LindsayMac> devslash: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-breakpoints
[19:43:06] <LindsayMac> ^^^
[19:43:25] <tw2113> if only chrome had a good search engine to use
[19:44:28] <LindsayMac> anyone wanna take a look at my stupid mobile site that's actin' a fool?
[19:45:01] <shoky> only if it does foolish dances
[19:45:11] <LindsayMac> it wont, but I will...
[19:45:17] <LindsayMac> i PROMISE!
[19:45:23] <shoky> url2cam plz
[19:45:42] <LindsayMac> you show me yours ill show you mine
[19:45:58] <shoky> i would, but i'm about to have some pizza
[19:46:22] <shoky> so, bbs;p
[19:46:29] <LindsayMac> ahh see... if i made a video, i would have been SOL
[19:47:35] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  would you look at my site in exchange for a foolish dance?? hahah
[19:48:07] <coldhead> i know so little about mobile stuff sorry LindsayMac
[19:48:51] <LindsayMac> Blahhhh .. its going to kill me
[19:48:56] <LindsayMac> the site as a whole that is..
[19:49:46] <coldhead> css matrix transforms are killing me :)
[19:49:53] <LindsayMac> its using a -webkit-transition (and transform) and it;s so weird because its working somewhat.. but not really
[19:50:01] <LindsayMac> +1
[19:51:04] <tw2113> ha "it's colder than the other side of the pillow in here"
[19:51:15] <igcewieling> I've read that after jQuery 1.4.1? onreadystatechange is used internally instead of a timer.  This makes onreadystatechange unavailable to be used by my code without lots of complicated stuff I don't understand.  Are there easy methods to access readyState 3 in more recent versions of jQuery.  I'm a n00b so I may not be asking the right question.
[19:52:10] <coldhead> do you really need onreadystatechange? i've never used it
[19:53:14] <igcewieling> yes.  comet-like streaming
[19:53:57] <igcewieling> it works just spiffy using an iframe, but there are UI side effects I don't like such as the spinner running forever and the mouse cursor staying "busy"
[19:55:26] <coldhead> i suspect i am much more n00b than you igcewieling
[19:55:27] <igcewieling> jQuery is awesome, but it looks like it might be easier to do it mostly in pure JS.  I just want to make sure I'm not missing something
[19:55:45] <igcewieling> coldhead: I'm not to bad with the really simple stuff. 8-|
[19:56:15] <HarryPitfall> igcewieling: some jQuery plugins do all the work in pure JS... just uses the jQuery framework to 'plug'
[19:56:42] <coldhead> igcewieling: have you looked at something like https://github.com/SeanOC/jquery.comet ?
[19:56:49] <igcewieling> HarryPitfall: I'm even more of a n00b with JS but I think I can figure out what is needed.
[19:57:26] <igcewieling> coldhead: I'll take a look at that.
[20:00:30] <LindsayMac> Ahh this isn't making sense
[20:01:07] <coldhead> nothing makes any sense
[20:02:16] <tw2113> what is sense?
[20:02:30] <tw2113> </philosophy>
[20:03:40] <HarryPitfall> this 'comet' is a long pooling method
[20:03:56] <HarryPitfall> I'm using this method for chat
[20:04:20] <HarryPitfall> since not all browser supports "EventSource" html5 object :/
[20:07:37] <igcewieling> I'm currently using a forever loading  iframe which spits JS to update the state of a list of phones connected to a PBX.
[20:09:35] <coldhead> clever
[20:10:45] <igcewieling> latency appears to be sub-1 second so I'm happy with it.
[20:20:48] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/qBg52GUG
[20:21:10] <Sean-Der> I have some XML that I am grabbing. For some reason I can't traverse it...
[20:21:39] <Sean-Der> Using a mixture of find and each I am still not having any luck :/
[20:22:01] <Sean-Der> I was gonna do a find each 'Details' and then grab each Key/Value, but I am not getting anything
[20:31:52] <Sean-Der> Figured it out! Server side issue, not jQuery
[20:32:15] <LindsayMac> w00t for Sean-Der
[20:38:04] <qbmaniac> Hi all
[20:38:32] <qbmaniac> IS there any function like "closest" that will get a parent X amount of nodes up the tree that matches a selector?
[20:38:58] <qbmaniac> Kind of like PrevUntil, but instead of getting everything except the selector I am looking for, it should return the one that matches the selector
[20:40:06] <qbmaniac> e.g. <div id="parent1"><ul><li id="test"> .... $("#test").prev("#parent1")           ... is there anything that can return that "#parent1" element?
[20:44:40] <coldhead> fucking matrices, how do THEY work
[20:44:58] <coldhead> ?closest @ qbmaniac
[20:44:58] <bot-t> qbmaniac, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[20:45:27] <coldhead> $('#test').closest('div') or .closest('#parent1')
[20:45:28] <qbmaniac> ohhh great thanks coldhead
[20:45:34] <qbmaniac> I thought closest went down through the tree
[20:45:39] <qbmaniac> It's good to know that :)
[20:45:43] <coldhead> nope that would be find()
[20:45:49] <qbmaniac> Cheers guys! Have a great Friday :P
[20:46:22] <coldhead> you too babe
[20:50:05] <coldhead> bot-t: tell qbmaniac I will never forget you
[20:50:05] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[21:02:45] <Sean-Der> So I am using console.debug and its returning my data like I expect in firebug, but attr is returning undefined
[21:03:40] <Sean-Der> Is there any other way to work with XML? XML->value sort of way
[21:06:34] <coldhead> is this any use to you, Sean-Der http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3957932/whats-the-best-way-to-parse-xml-response-in-ajax
[21:09:03] <Sean-Der> coldhead: Yes! Thank you for the read :D I realized I should be calling .val instead
[21:09:17] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok, so I have a problem. I am trying to get the width value of one DIV on mouseup, so I can use it to set the value of another div. problem is, the value that gets passed is the old value (before the click event)
[21:16:57] <coldhead> show us your code, HAPPYFUNBRO
[21:17:03] <coldhead> how's your struggle, LindsayMac?
[21:17:21] <tw2113> i think she went home for the night coldhead
[21:17:28] * coldhead np: founder - the tom cruise in you
[21:17:30] <coldhead> oh good
[21:17:34] <coldhead> let
[21:18:26] <coldhead> let's get drunk*
[21:19:19] <HAPPYFUNBRO> coldhead http://pastebin.com/tdZ2UMEy
[21:20:16] <HAPPYFUNBRO> the problem is, the console logs the value that was set on the previous click
[21:21:31] <coldhead> this hurts me eyes
[21:22:42] <HAPPYFUNBRO> hm
[21:22:42] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[21:22:45] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I got it
[21:22:47] <coldhead> okay, line 7 used to be at line 5
[21:22:52] <coldhead> why did you move it?
[21:22:56] <HAPPYFUNBRO> the timeout wasn't set properly
[21:23:30] <HAPPYFUNBRO> for some reason, it needs the timeout to register the change
[21:23:31] <coldhead> i would put it back at line 5
[21:23:32] <HAPPYFUNBRO> strange
[21:23:36] <coldhead> and i would use var
[21:23:37] <HAPPYFUNBRO> that did not work
[21:23:47] <coldhead> to avoid making these all global vars
[21:23:51] <HAPPYFUNBRO> the vars are set in the constructor
[21:24:04] <coldhead> of course, how silly of me
[21:24:10] <HAPPYFUNBRO> they need to be global for other methods in the program
[21:24:16] <HAPPYFUNBRO> yeah
[21:24:30] <coldhead> i would start over without the setTimeout
[21:24:35] <coldhead> that's just going to fuck you up
[21:24:53] <HAPPYFUNBRO> you would think so
[21:25:08] <HAPPYFUNBRO> but there doesn't appear to be any way to get the new width value
[21:25:56] <HAPPYFUNBRO> rather, any way without using a really short timeout
[21:25:59] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I am not using 50ms
[21:26:20] <HAPPYFUNBRO> *now
[21:27:29] <coldhead> so i guess you are compensating for the lag in jPlayer?
[21:27:47] <HAPPYFUNBRO> must be
[21:27:53] <coldhead> its a shame it doesn't provide you with callbacks for when the volume changes
[21:27:55] <coldhead> unless it does
[21:28:00] <coldhead> are you sure it doesn't?
[21:28:10] <HAPPYFUNBRO> the version I'm working with doesn't
[21:28:16] <coldhead> le sigh
[21:28:31] <HAPPYFUNBRO> unfortunately, it doesn't appear that the creators ever envisoned that the player would be used this way
[21:31:59] <HAPPYFUNBRO> it just makes for more code for me!
[22:06:52] <aaas> how can I get independent slideToggles ("hide1" and "hide2") http://jsfiddle.net/4VAqh/
[22:11:20] <martisj> does on bind to dynamically created elements as well?"

[22:24:00] <aaas> sahbeewah thanks!
[22:26:49] <aaas> sahbeewah actually one more thing if your'e there...i want to use the rel reference to close the other div elements (so the hide1 rel should collapse the hide1 class)
[22:28:30] <sahbeewah> $('.' + toggleDiv).slideToggle();
[22:29:08] <aaas> sahbeewah that's it! thanks again!
[23:13:38] <arbitraryuser> I have an event e that is triggered by a submit button in a form, I want to modify an <input> field inside that form when the submit button is clicked. I've tried $(e.target.form).find('[name="confirmed"]).val('foobar'); but that isn't working....
