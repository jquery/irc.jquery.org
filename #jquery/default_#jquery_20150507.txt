[00:03:41] <surianup> please give me the suggestion to catch the event

[00:07:44] <crillegustafsson> how to remove Mirror action ----> http://jsfiddle.net/makzan/ubcnc/
[00:27:01] <norc> Hi. Why doesn't this fire the beforeSend event? https://jsfiddle.net/f6scw8w9/
[00:28:50] <Cork> norc: the event is only fired on document
[00:29:05] <Cork> you can't bind it on random elements in the page
[00:29:33] <Cork> norc: secondly the event is beforeSend not ajax:beforeSend
[00:30:08] <Cork> norc: also the event you want is most likely ajaxStart not beforeSend
[00:31:03] <norc> Cork: According to the documentation beforeSend is a local event.
[00:32:03] <Cork> norc: ya, i saw that, and wasn't really sure what they meant
[00:32:15] <Cork> norc: checking the code: it means it isn't an event, its a callback
[00:32:33] <Cork> so you can only listen for beforeSend through ajaxSetup or $.ajax
[00:32:42] <Cork> *$.ajaxSetup
[00:32:59] <norc> Cork: Argh ok. THen its just niceness of Rails to specifically start an ajax:beforeSend event on the element in the beforeSend callback.
[00:33:00] <Cork> these are the events $.ajax fires: "ajaxStart", "ajaxStop", "ajaxComplete", "ajaxError", "ajaxSuccess", "ajaxSend"
[00:33:15] <norc> Yeah all of which are global on the document, and thus useless to me.
[00:33:28] <Cork> ya, rails add some extra weird events
[00:33:41] <Cork> jquery doesn't create any ajax:* events
[00:34:04] <Cork> and it actually breaks the name convention in jquery
[00:34:13] <norc> Cork: Yeah now that you mention it.. :)
[00:34:23] <norc> Cork: Well in this case it makes sense why rails is doing thise
[00:34:42] <Cork> not really, i don't see why this belongs in the event system at all
[00:35:03] <Cork> (i have a problem with the ones jquery already provides actually)
[00:35:07] <norc> They allow you to declare a form as "remote" (thus making it use ajax), but dont have a way of specifying the callback. Thus it makes sense that they instead fire a custom event named "ajax:beforeSend" in the beforeSend callback.
[00:35:23] <Cork> sure, but there are cleaner ways to do that then abuse the event system
[00:35:42] <norc> They want their users to decouple javascript code from the rest.
[00:35:45] <Cork> $.ajax isn't an element in the page
[00:35:56] <Cork> so it makes no sense for it to cause dom events
[00:36:25] <Cork> norc: well they are actually coupling it
[00:36:35] <Cork> and that is part of my problem with it
[00:37:20] <norc> Cork: So in your opinion the cleaner way would be to handle all the ajax magic manually, instead of letting Rails do it magically with firing events?
[00:37:54] <Cork> i remove the jquery_rails gem if that answers your question :)
[00:38:18] <norc> Haha :)
[00:38:30] <Cork> and yes js is completely decoupled from my markup
[00:38:58] <Cork> my views contains exactly 0 lines of js
[00:39:09] <norc> So do mine. :-P
[00:39:10] <Cork> (well except for application.html.erb)
[00:39:53] <norc> But ok, I think you have helped me. Thanks Cork.
[00:41:55] <norc> Cork: On that note I have a question out of curiosity if you dont mind
[00:42:10] <norc> Do you use CoffeeScript?
[00:42:18] <Cork> no
[00:42:24] <norc> Why not?
[00:42:28] <Cork> i hate coffeescript with a passion :)
[00:42:46] <Cork> it incorporates rubys biggest problem into javascript
[00:42:56] <Cork> (implicit returns)
[00:43:22] <Cork> its enough to have to add return and breaks all over the place in the models to prevent accidental returns
[00:43:32] <Cork> i don't want to have to litter the js with it too
[00:44:06] <Cork> yes, we have mandatory returns for all our module methods
[00:44:22] <Cork> we had a few bugs back in the 1.8 era where one removed a line in a validator
[00:44:27] <Cork> and suddenly nothing validated
[00:44:56] <Cork> oh right some_variable = something.blank? *opps this suddenly became the last line, and not it aborts the validation*
[00:46:04] <norc> Cork: I see. Me personally I have never understood the need for CoffeeScript in the first place. I just tried it in this project because I figured why the hell not.
[00:46:43] <Cork> norc: es6 is a much more interesting option to me
[00:47:12] <Cork> and if they replaced coffeescript with a preprocessor that handles es6 and makes es5 compatible code of it
[00:47:18] <Cork> then i would actually be interested

[00:58:33] <Expel> surianup: Google your problem, bud: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23809766/jquery-if-hasclass-then-addclass
[01:02:32] <Uhkis> Expel: that error occurs when your code attempts to use a method before the Masonry instance has been initialized ;)
[01:03:41] <Expel> Uhkis: I understand that part, but the thing is I've the code in my footer using WP, and it all works fine but when I trigger the button to load the other page it stops working and I get the error.
[01:04:18] <Uhkis> ?demo
[01:04:32] <Uhkis> b-ot: what's wrong with you?
[01:04:32] <b-ot> Uhkis: yes â€” definitely.
[01:05:05] <Uhkis> Expel: make a fiddle or link to live site
[01:06:39] <Expel> Uhkis: God... I can't it's way to messy to get everything up again, I'm doing it localy at the moment. Do you just have any thoughts about it?
[01:07:10] <Uhkis> your .done() doesn't re-initialize masonry?
[01:08:00] <Expel> Uhkis: It's working fine until I try to load the content using Ajax, this is my code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ba6922ca8e417da84aa4
[01:15:54] <Uhkis> Expel: you will never reload masonry items with that code
[01:23:26] <Expel> Uhkis: Why not, what's wrong with it? It's working just fine until I trigger the button that loads the content from the other page using Ajax, as I mentioned before.
[01:25:29] <Uhkis> nvm, that's way too many plugins over plugins to make any kind of sense without a real demo
[02:13:18] <JohnDow> HHow come null in javascript is not considered null in php i think. cause it bypasses (CodeIgniter's) form validation. I'm sending form via ajax
[02:13:35] <JohnDow> here's my script
[02:13:35] <JohnDow> How come null in javascript is not considered null in php i think. cause it bypasses CI's form validation. I'm sending form via ajax
[02:13:38] <JohnDow> oops
[02:13:52] <JohnDow> http://hastebin.com/ahiwicocer.xml
[02:14:01] <JohnDow> I'm using the bootstrap file input plugin
[02:22:16] <Woet> JohnDow: no idea what your actual question is.
[02:23:34] <JohnDow> ok, the real problem is, null value in js is considered not empty in my php form validation
[02:24:56] <Cork> JohnDow: what do you mean by "null value"?
[02:24:58] <pauled> hi, how can I write 'if not' in this: if ($rematch.hasClass('disabled')) {
[02:25:01] <Cork> you mean the litteral null?
[02:25:09] <JohnDow> yes
[02:25:18] <Cork> pauled: if(!$rematch.hasClass('disabled'))
[02:25:27] <pauled> ah thanks :)
[02:25:31] <Cork> JohnDow: how are you encoding the value?
[02:25:51] <Cork> JohnDow: cause for example params doesn't support null
[02:25:59] <Cork> it expects "" in those cases
[02:25:59] <JohnDow> like what you saw in my hastebin
[02:26:04] <JohnDow> "null" ??
[02:26:09] <JohnDow> but that would become a string
[02:26:27] <Cork> i can't see how you send it to the server
[02:26:36] <Cork> or are you talking about the php inline?
[02:26:39] <JohnDow> via ajax, post
[02:26:50] <Cork> i don't see any post
[02:27:04] <pauled> Cork: I mean if rematch has not class called 'disabled' ?
[02:27:28] <Cork> pauled: yes that is what you got
[02:27:35] <pauled> Cork: thanks :)
[02:27:37] <JohnDow> the fileinput plugin has an upload feature
[02:28:08] <JohnDow> the post datas are those that are inside the uploadExtraData
[02:28:11] <Cork> ok, then i suspect it uses www-form-encoded
[02:28:18] <Cork> and again it doesn't support null
[02:28:25] <Cork> so if you want to send "nothing" you should send ""
[02:28:51] <Cork> cause if you send null it will be "null" and that is a 4 character string
[02:29:21] <Cork> JohnDow: remember http is text, not raw data
[02:30:35] <JohnDow> ohh, so null in js when sent to php is converted to a string? is that what you mean?
[02:30:55] <Cork> yes
[02:31:08] <JohnDow> so now i need to do IF statements on my $("#id").val(); and check if it's empty and turn it into an empty string?
[02:31:14] <Cork> what ever you send from client to server has to be converted to text one way or another
[02:31:31] <Cork> JohnDow: .val() on an input field is ALWAYS a string
[02:31:58] <Cork> so if you get null it means you do something with it
[02:32:07] <JohnDow> a disabled option
[02:32:46] <JohnDow> can you help me with that? I have "Please Select a Category" in my select option
[02:32:46] <Cork> also you should prob look into using serializeArray
[02:33:01] <Cork> it filters out disabled elements by default
[02:35:35] <JohnDow> can't i just do IF == NULL then var = "" ??
[02:35:49] <Cork> you should NEVER get null
[02:36:10] <JohnDow> im getting null cause the option is disabled
[02:36:14] <Cork> check what failing code gives you null instead of plastering over it
[02:36:20] <JohnDow> <option selected disabled>Please Select A Category</option>
[02:36:23] <pauled> How do I double 'if' example if (!$foo.hasClass('bar')) && (!$bar.hasClass('foo')) {
[02:36:25] <Cork> you shouldn't get null for a disabled option either
[02:36:34] <JohnDow> wat?
[02:36:43] <JohnDow> what would i get supposed to be?
[02:36:59] <pauled> me?
[02:37:04] <Cork> JohnDow: a string
[02:37:09] <Cork> the dom always give you strings
[02:37:15] <JohnDow> this is how i get the value
[02:37:16] <JohnDow> $("#product_category").val();
[02:37:28] <Cork> JohnDow: reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[02:37:30] <JohnDow> everything works fine
[02:37:30] <JohnDow> but not this one
[02:37:48] <Cork> pauled: why are you asking how to do somethign when you just pasted it?
[02:38:09] <pauled> not sure if this is correct
[02:38:11] <Cork> except for the faulty parenthesis
[02:38:25] <pauled> if (!$foo.hasClass('bar')) && (!$bar.hasClass('foo'))  is correct?
[02:38:29] <Cork> pauled: so think a little
[02:38:35] <Cork> pauled: have you tried?
[02:38:42] <pauled> nope
[02:38:57] <pauled> I will try

[03:06:10] <caraconan> Hi there. Why I can see the image displayed here? http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/fa0593d2/ Thanks
[03:07:43] <javalover> does anyone in here know why my image when displayed on mobile is smaller than when displayed on desktop?
[03:08:43] <MrStar> probably different DPI
[03:08:57] <javalover> ic
[03:09:08] <javalover> is there a way I can check dpi & change width/height based on that?
[03:09:13] <MrStar> screens are usually at 72 or 96 dpi unless you change that
[03:09:20] <MrStar> mobile phones have a higher dpi count
[03:10:39] <MrStar> you could try having a separate CSS file, that would target mobile devices
[03:10:55] <MrStar> I haven't worked with those though ("media") so I do not have any experience there
[03:11:09] <javalover> ic i do have experience i'm just still figuring this out
[03:11:23] <javalover> the hardest part is that devices are different...
[03:11:39] <javalover> but I thought surely at the very least your original image display would be default
[03:11:53] <javalover> but now i'm understanding the dpi changes everything so just looking for a fix
[03:11:58] <javalover> i'm almost done with my mobile site too rofl
[03:12:07] <javalover> it's always something rofl
[03:13:05] <MrStar> I am trying to think of something, but I just lack the experience in this regard.. I just know DPI usually causes these problems
[03:13:40] <javalover> well i guess what I was doing was setting everything based on percentages
[03:13:54] <javalover> and that was kinda working but idk
[03:14:41] <MrStar> I suppose you could use js or even jquery to get the screens dpi .. but if someone has several screens (like I do), they might be on different DPI, too ...
[03:14:51] <MrStar> so refresh might be necessary, too..
[03:15:10] <MrStar> usually though not just images, but css becomes smaller / bigger depending on DPI, too...
[03:15:21] <javalover> you'd think
[03:15:26] <javalover> if this is such a relevant issue
[03:15:34] <javalover> that someone would code into browsers a freaking DPI check function
[03:18:49] <javalover> sooo ok
[03:18:52] <javalover> that explains a lot though
[03:19:02] <javalover> so when I view my site on my desktop & go "this is gigantic"
[03:19:08] <javalover> it's because my css is set to whatever dpi it has
[03:19:10] <JohnDow> how do i select the value of <option selected disabled>y</option>
[03:19:21] <javalover> so my computer has 72, and my phone has the higher dpi
[03:19:28] <decx> you get the value from the select JohnDow
[03:19:29] <javalover> thus I don't have seperate css
[03:19:33] <javalover> lol ok this is good though
[03:19:46] <javalover> this also means the @media query would only go off on devices with higher dpi
[03:20:12] <javalover> so technically I can use my monitor as a test for devices with 72 dpi and there isn't a device with lower than 72?
[03:20:27] <MrStar> no .. the usual LCD is 96 I think
[03:20:33] <MrStar> CRT monitors were 72 I believe
[03:20:41] <javalover> ok fine so i'm at 96
[03:20:54] <javalover> do you think any mobile devices are less than 96?
[03:20:59] <MrStar> I also /think/ that firefox let's you emulate screen resolution
[03:21:07] <javalover> yeah but i've tried that
[03:21:17] <javalover> and it's well it could just be because of dpi
[03:21:19] <MrStar> no .. I don't think there are any lower than 72 ..
[03:21:20] <JohnDow> decx
[03:21:31] <JohnDow> $("#id").val(); is returning null
[03:21:31] <javalover> hmm idk i need a system but for now
[03:21:33] <JohnDow> or undefined
[03:21:47] <javalover> lets just try for high end devices i'll keep in mind the dpi and figure this out
[03:22:09] <javalover> my phone is really shitty too..it's an alcatel but yeah this will work thx for help in clarifying for me
[03:22:11] <javalover> i was so lost rofl
[03:22:22] <javalover> JohnDow what is your issue?
[03:22:33] <MrStar> no problem javalover
[03:22:39] <javalover> MrStar :D
[03:22:49] <decx> i suggest you fiddle up
[03:22:50] <JohnDow> someone here told me im supposed to get an empty string instead of null or undefined even tho the option is disabled
[03:22:55] <javalover> <option selected disabled>y</option>
[03:22:57] <javalover> that's wrong bro
[03:23:09] <javalover> <option value="hi">y</option>
[03:23:11] <JohnDow> how should i do it then?
[03:23:12] <javalover> set a value
[03:23:23] <JohnDow> but i want it to be disabled :\
[03:23:25] <javalover> i think you can also get the text displayed
[03:23:45] <javalover> but .val() is reserved to grab the value="" attribute
[03:24:01] <decx> selected and disabled makes no sense
[03:24:15] <JohnDow> someone here told me i'll still get an empty string
[03:24:25] <javalover> no you can totally grab the text displayed
[03:24:31] <javalover> .text() maybe...hold on lemme google
[03:24:39] <MrStar> <option selected="selected" disabled="disabled">...</option> I believe..
[03:24:39] <JohnDow> yes you're right
[03:24:53] <javalover> $("#yourdropdownid option:selected").text();
[03:24:53] <MrStar> though that's just a different *ML notation
[03:24:58] <javalover> straight off stackoverflow
[03:25:30] <javalover> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1643227/get-selected-text-from-drop-down-list-select-box-using-jquery
[03:25:38] <javalover> does that help at all JohnDow?
[03:25:56] <JohnDow> i can get the text
[03:26:16] <JohnDow> so is there any way to make it disabled but have a value?
[03:26:34] <javalover> like grayed out?
[03:26:37] <JohnDow> yes
[03:26:38] <javalover> so you can't select it, but it's there?
[03:26:41] <javalover> hmmmm
[03:26:42] <JohnDow> yes
[03:27:04] <Orien> JohnDow dont u want like a separator or something like it ?
[03:27:04] <zclever> so hungery
[03:27:11] <javalover> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_option_disabled.asp
[03:27:22] <javalover> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_option_disabled
[03:27:25] <javalover> try those
[03:27:26] <javalover> :D
[03:27:54] <JohnDow> i'll try adding value even if it's disabled
[03:28:06] <javalover> yeah probably has to do with how browser reads it
[03:28:20] <JohnDow> nope
[03:28:20] <javalover> if you're using a plugin to change your dropdownmenu
[03:28:22] <JohnDow> still null
[03:28:30] <javalover> there is a chance, that the plugin ALTERS the dropdownmenu
[03:28:37] <javalover> in which case it's up to the plugin for you to do this properly
[03:28:41] <javalover> so please try with standard html
[03:28:50] <javalover> as that clealry works, agreed everyone?
[03:28:50] <javalover> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_option_disabled
[03:28:59] <javalover> does that work to disable a dropdownmenu option?
[03:29:01] <JohnDow> im just using the bootstrap select for styling
[03:29:01] <javalover> cuz it works for me...
[03:29:16] <javalover> hey man, it works for w3schools lol
[03:29:35] <JohnDow> maybe i'll just disable it after change
[03:29:41] <JohnDow> tht would be better
[03:29:53] <javalover> i'm not sure what your issue is but I can tell you this
[03:29:55] <javalover> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_option_disabled
[03:29:56] <javalover> works
[03:30:57] <javalover> JohnDow this is how I found my most recent issue with images, I took the image out of my code & just displayed it & said "oh okay it's not my code, the image is legit smaller on this screen" so I suggest you do the same, isolate the issue & find a resolution :D
[03:44:04] <decx> that's how you solve every problem
[03:44:06] <decx> :>
[03:44:29] <decx> also dont use w3schools
[03:45:21] <vlt> Hello. I have an element that is only visible when I hover over its parent element (#child-div {display:none}; #parent-div:hover div {display: block;}). Running $("#child-div").fadeOut() works but that sets the element's style to "display:none;" and the ":hover" doesn't work anymore. I already tried $("#child-div").fadeOut().removeAttr("style") but it still doesn't work. Any idea how to accomplish this?
[03:49:29] <decx> well #child-div has priority over #parent-div div
[03:49:42] <JohnDow> how do i disable the first child of my select on change? i tried everything, i do it like this http://www.hastebin.com/yugimicuxe.coffee
[03:50:15] <Cork> ?api prop
[03:50:16] <b-ot> Cork: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[03:50:32] <Cork> attr is for attribute values not property changes
[03:52:34] <JohnDow> changed the attr to prop and still not getting disabled
[03:53:31] <Cork> you are getting the disable state
[03:53:36] <Cork> you want to set true/false
[03:53:37] <vlt> decx: Yes. Any idea how to remove any CSS style for #child-div?
[03:53:56] <Cork> JohnDow: .prop('disabled') == returns the current state
[03:54:05] <Cork> JohnDow: .prop('disabled', true/false) sets the state
[03:54:12] <JohnDow> ohh sorry
[03:54:15] <JohnDow> thanks
[03:54:16] <JohnDow> ;)
[03:55:44] <xqo> is this naming offensive? tag.components*Tag.prototype.tagTypes[tag.type].type.size
[04:03:38] <JohnDow> $(this).children().first().prop("disabled",true) cant disable the first option
[04:03:50] <JohnDow> i tried :first-child, etc
[04:04:00] <Cork> should work, could you make a jsfiddle?
[04:04:10] <JohnDow> ok
[04:04:15] <JohnDow> wait i'll just make one
[04:05:53] <JohnDow> yea it works in jsfiddle
[04:05:53] <JohnDow> hmm
[04:06:55] <JohnDow> here's my code
[04:06:56] <JohnDow> http://www.hastebin.com/udoqacuwor.xml
[04:07:10] <JohnDow> but it's not working. it works in jsfiddle thi
[04:07:12] <JohnDow> tho
[04:07:49] <Cork> the only think i can guess is that the selector doesn't work cause you add the selector after you try to bind the event handler
[04:08:37] <Uhkis> that php mess hurts my eyes
[04:08:40] <JohnDow> wut? i didn't follow you
[04:09:02] <JohnDow> Uhkis, vice-versa here hahaha
[04:09:14] <Cork> JohnDow: $('selector').change searches for the element matching the selector and binds the event handler to the found elements
[04:09:25] <Cork> JohnDow: if the html you showed is added through ajax
[04:09:34] <JohnDow> no it's not
[04:09:39] <Uhkis> JohnDow: why on earth would you use apostrophes for html
[04:09:43] <JohnDow> it's added on page load
[04:09:46] <Cork> then you share too little data
[04:10:18] <Uhkis> JohnDow: that jquery-part is in <script> tags, right..?
[04:11:01] <JohnDow> yes
[04:13:10] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[04:13:57] <al-damiri> I'm doing a $('#myID').insertAfter('<tr</tr>'), now I want to insert <td>(s) in this row. How do I get this row?
[04:14:13] <al-damiri> i.e. without having to add an id to it.
[04:14:15] <al-damiri> Is it possible?
[04:14:47] <Cork> al-damiri: you should invert that
[04:14:51] <Cork> build the table row
[04:14:55] <Cork> add the content to it
[04:15:01] <Cork> (build all rows if you have more)
[04:15:07] <Cork> and THEN append it all in one go to the page
[04:16:57] <al-damiri> How do I add to the row?
[04:17:05] <al-damiri> Cork: String concatenation?
[04:18:22] <JohnDow> i got it working now
[04:18:50] <javalover> nice!!!
[04:23:56] <Cork> al-damiri: make a jquery array and append to it
[04:26:42] <JohnDow> it;s working now
[04:28:16] <Cork> al-damiri: ex. var obj = $(); obj = obj.add($('<tr>').append('<td>'));
[04:30:44] <JohnDow> i just needed to refresh the bootstrap select plugin
[04:31:00] <al-damiri> Cork: Why not directly var obj = $().add($('<tr>')); ?
[04:31:14] <al-damiri> and then do obj.append('<td>') ?
[04:31:26] <JohnDow> now i'm doing $('<div></div>').appendTo("#message").hide().replaceWith(alertMessage).fadeIn(); how do i remove the message placed after a successful ajax call? cause the messages are getting stacked
[04:31:26] <al-damiri> Cork: Oops.
[04:31:34] <al-damiri> Cork: I got the parenthesis wrong :)
[04:31:51] <al-damiri> Cork: I have to add multiple <td>(s).
[04:32:19] <Cork> al-damiri: obj is meant to be the collection of trs
[04:32:41] <Cork> al-damiri: after you've filled it with the new rows you do table.append(obj) (outside the loop)
[04:33:04] <Cork> al-damiri: the reason you want to do it this way is cause dom updates trigger reflow in the browser
[04:33:24] <Cork> where the browser calculates the dimention of every element in the page (with some optimization skips)
[04:33:29] <Cork> so it is very costly
[04:33:40] <al-damiri> Cork: I get it now.
[04:33:48] <Cork> for this reason you want to append to the actual dom as few times as possible
[04:34:20] <al-damiri> Cork: But I need to add multiple columns (<td>(s)) to the <tr>.
[04:34:30] <al-damiri> Cork: and then add the row as a whole to DOM.
[04:34:57] <Cork> al-damiri: so do var row = $('<tr>'); row.append().append().append(); ... obj = obj.add(row);
[04:34:58] <al-damiri> Cork: Can I do var row = $('<tr>');
[04:35:09] <al-damiri> then row.appends etc.
[04:35:19] <Cork> and eys .append doesn't have to be changed
[04:35:24] <Cork> they can be separate calls
[04:35:33] <Cork> *'chained
[04:35:53] <al-damiri> Cork: So .append() returns the same <tr>.
[04:35:58] <al-damiri> Cork: I see.
[04:35:58] <Cork> yes
[04:44:20] <pauled> Hi, why in console this doesn't click $('.control.buttons a:eq(0)').click(); but this work $('.control.buttons a').get(0).click();
[04:44:51] <Cork> $('.control.buttons a:eq(0)')[0].click()
[04:44:57] <Cork> .get != .eq
[04:45:30] <pauled> ah thanks, so :eq(0) here is useless?
[04:45:53] <Cork> $('.control.buttons a:eq(0)') == $('.control.buttons a').qe(0)
[04:45:58] <Cork> uh....
[04:46:02] <Cork> * $('.control.buttons a:eq(0)') == $('.control.buttons a').eq(0)
[04:46:13] <Cork> .get(0) == [0]
[04:46:29] <Cork> so when you run .click() in the second case you call it directly on the dom element
[04:46:46] <Cork> while the first one is a short hand for jquery().trigger('click')
[04:47:55] <pauled> I am confused. What do I have to keep to get click() work here?
[04:48:17] <Cork> both work, it depends on what you are trying to do
[04:48:53] <Cork> meaning both work, but they do different things
[04:49:05] <pauled> trying to trigger click()
[04:49:19] <Cork> then .click() without .get should work just fine
[04:50:31] <pauled> -.-' :)
[04:50:36] <Cork> pauled: ('.control.buttons a')
[04:51:11] <pauled> there can be more than 1 <a>
[04:51:35] <Cork> sure, so can it be in the code i gave you
[04:51:47] <Cork> i just didn't ad it
[04:51:49] <Cork> *add
[04:52:40] <pauled> so in some page  $('.control.buttons a:eq(0)').click(); work, but not in another page with the same HTML except that <a> had href
[04:53:41] <pauled> I will try with $('.control.buttons a:eq(0)')[0].click()
[04:54:50] <pauled> Cork: If I want the second <a> this following is correct? $('.control.buttons a:eq(0)')[1].click()
[05:06:11] <uskerine> How do you change the value of this in jQuery?   Wasn't it .val()?  <input class="form-control" id="pwd" placeholder="Contraseña" type="text">
[05:07:10] <JohnDow> http://www.hastebin.com/gufesusozi.coffee
[05:07:43] <JohnDow> when im posting via ajax it's still empty
[05:08:51] <ilhami> hey guys.
[05:09:07] <ilhami> errors = data.responseText; this outputs:
[05:09:20] <ilhami> {"user_id":{"Required":[]},"password":{"Required":[]}}
[05:09:23] <ilhami> is that valid json?
[05:10:57] <Cork> uskerine: yes it is .val(newValue)
[05:11:21] <Cork> ilhami: yes
[05:11:58] <ilhami> Cork, how can I read this the best way? I tried with $.each
[05:11:59] <uskerine> Cork, thanks I found the issue, the button I was using to change the value was type submit and not button, so changes were lost
[05:12:04] <Cork> ilhami: if you get the errors callback, remember to check the third argument
[05:12:33] <ilhami> Cork, I am using the fail callback. Is that bad?
[05:12:41] <ilhami> let me show you.
[05:12:57] <Cork> ilhami: no its is the new way to do it (i just said error callback cause you typed errors=)
[05:13:17] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/ia5B
[05:13:24] <Cork> but it is the same thing
[05:13:36] <Cork> what matters is check the third argument to the callback
[05:14:06] <ilhami> I am doing something wrong I guess.
[05:14:27] <Cork> fail doesn't have a data argument
[05:14:36] <Cork> ?api jquery.ajax
[05:14:36] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:15:48] <ilhami> jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown :P
[05:15:53] <ilhami> these are the three arguments I guess.
[05:15:55] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[05:16:04] <Cork> yes and like i've said several times
[05:16:08] <Cork> check the  third argument
[05:17:23] <al-damiri> I have dynamically created some rows which contains <input>(s). I have assigned them ids like myInput1, myInput2 etc. Now what is a good way to get all these input(s) in different rows?
[05:18:07] <Cork> al-damiri: why not just set the id when you create them?
[05:18:25] <Cork> al-damiri: also it starts to sound like you should look into a template engine
[05:18:39] <Cork> making this many elements in js tend to be extremely messy
[05:19:17] <al-damiri> Cork: I have set the ids, but I haven't saved them somewhere :).
[05:19:29] <al-damiri> Cork: Template engine like?
[05:19:31] <Cork> why do you need to save them?
[05:19:38] <Cork> ?g jqote
[05:19:38] <b-ot> Cork: jQote â€“ client-side templating : once upon my code â†’ http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote/
[05:19:42] <Cork> opps
[05:19:44] <Cork> ?g jqote2
[05:19:50] <b-ot> Cork: jQote2 â€“ Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code â†’ http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[05:19:52] <Cork> ?g mustache
[05:19:53] <ilhami> But Cork I don't need the third argument. I need the responseText that comes from the API. :P
[05:19:55] <b-ot> Cork: {{ mustache }} â†’ https://mustache.github.io/
[05:20:07] <Cork> underscore is another common one
[05:20:11] <ilhami> the errorThrown just gives me Unprocessable Entity
[05:20:24] <al-damiri> Cork: Actually I'm creating the rows and input controls dynamically from a webservice. Then the user will edit the table rows. Now I want to update them back to server.
[05:20:39] <al-damiri> Cork: So need to process each row input.
[05:20:50] <Cork> ilhami: the third argument is normally interesting cause it lets you see why $.ajax called .fail even if the server sent 200
[05:21:13] <al-damiri> Cork: I can do like get all rows in table, and then do $('myInput' + i) etc.
[05:21:19] <ilhami> my API doesn't send 200 even if the request was send successfully. :P
[05:21:25] <Cork> al-damiri: you don't need the id for that
[05:21:25] <al-damiri> Cork: and get their values, but I thought if there is any better way.
[05:21:27] <ilhami> I send error messages back on fails
[05:21:39] <Cork> if you want to push it to the server you want to use serializeArray
[05:21:51] <Cork> if you want to update the backend server as a button is clicked (per row)
[05:22:02] <Cork> then you just want a delegated event handler
[05:22:17] <Cork> i can't think of a single reason except for label to even have the id
[05:22:40] <al-damiri> Cork: It will be pushed once, with some other parent data for the rows.
[05:22:55] <Cork> al-damiri: so .serializeArray then
[05:23:09] <Cork> $('form').serializeArray()
[05:23:37] <ilhami> I just need a way to parse this: {"user_id":{"Required":[]},"password":{"Required":[]}
[05:23:44] <ilhami> }
[05:23:58] <Cork> var data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)
[05:24:11] <ilhami> yeah exactly. :P
[05:24:34] <ilhami> it was that easy. :)
[05:24:50] <Cork> ilhami: that said it is normally a bad idea to have none 200 states as a response like that
[05:25:03] <Cork> it is normally better to have the state in the json response
[05:25:13] <Cork> and only give none 200 responses if you get server error
[05:25:43] <ilhami> Yeah. Well there is a difference of opinion on that subject. I asked in #php about that as well.
[05:25:59] <Cork> heh
[05:26:52] <ilhami> but I will think about that.
[05:27:26] <ilhami> thanks a lot.
[05:28:07] <al-damiri> Cork: But for .serializeArray I need to set the name="" to exact value as expected in server, right?
[05:28:18] <al-damiri> Cork: i.e. name= for the <input> control.
[05:28:22] <Cork> al-damiri: yes, and that is where it should be anyway
[05:28:36] <Cork> and if you do it that way you won't even need the id
[05:28:44] <Cork> you could just use name="something[]"
[05:29:03] <al-damiri> Cork: Cool great
[05:29:31] <al-damiri> Cork: One another thing. The <input> aren't inside a <form> :)
[05:29:41] <al-damiri> Cork: Would that be an issue?
[05:29:43] <Cork> al-damiri: they should be
[05:30:02] <Cork> if you expect the user to make an input it should be in a form
[05:30:06] <Cork> <form> is enough
[05:30:12] <al-damiri> Cork: Yes. They should be (I haven't written this I was handed this code by other colleague.)
[05:30:13] <Cork> action/method is optional
[05:30:23] <al-damiri> Cork: I see.
[05:30:46] <Cork> personally i think action is a good place to store the url (instead of hardcoding it in js)
[05:30:57] <Cork> but that isn't as important as it is to have the form tag
[05:31:26] <Cork> basically i keep data out of js as much as possible
[05:31:37] <al-damiri> Cork: Actually, we'll be submitting an XMLRPC request, not doing a POST or GET. So the initial devs didn't bother to have a <form> :(
[05:31:41] <Cork> it should react to css+html and not keep it inside
[05:31:50] <al-damiri> Cork: I see.
[05:46:52] <cool_boy> if .js supports variable no of arguments? eg there is a function defination discount() , I want to call this.disocunt(type) at some places, and override method with 'type' parameter, basically I want both calls be working is that possible or will give some issues?
[05:56:48] <robert_> so I'm trying to get a bootstrap 3 component I found working on non-single-element containers ($(this) vs. id="this"); here's what I have so far (http://sprunge.us/IRUR?lang=js)
[06:03:17] <juro> hi, I want various parts of a page to highlight when closing a Bootstrap modal. These parts are (partly ...) loaded using jquery's .load function, so not available right away. I cannot use the ajaxComplete, as other functions will be called in the modal before it is closed. How can I solve this?
[06:14:51] <lilalinu_> I replaced all my object iterators from for to $.each(), but now I realized, that the context changes and all references to "this" are broken. Is there an implicit way to acces the "outer this" apart from having to wrap it in a helper variable before each $.each()?
[06:20:17] <juro> lilalinu_, before you call the load, save the $(this) in a varilable. Then you can access that variable inside the each ...
[06:21:16] <lilalinu_> I wanted to avoid "a helper variable before each $.each()"
[06:21:23] <lilalinu_> :-)
[06:22:11] <lilalinu_> the jquery iterator saves me 1 line. If I have to waste it for var self = this, then nothing is won
[06:23:21] <juro> oh, ok. There is probably a fancy way but I don't know, sorry :(
[06:23:47] <decx> there is
[06:23:49] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/7rj47Lj9/
[06:25:30] <lilalinu_> that looks nice
[06:25:39] <lilalinu_> does that work for the other each, too?
[06:25:58] <decx> works with every function
[06:26:01] <lilalinu_> $.each(object, function(key, value){});
[06:32:08] <juro> decx, any idea how I can wait for all $.load inside an $.each to finish before running another function?
[06:33:09] <lilalinu_> juro: you could make it async (don't)
[06:33:24] <lilalinu_> juro: you should keep track of all loads
[06:33:28] <juro> lilalinu_?
[06:33:45] <decx> use $.when
[06:34:05] <lilalinu_> Oh, I was thinking about ajax requests
[06:34:16] <lilalinu_> and the async actually was async : false
[06:35:25] <blinky_> Hi guys, I am trying to get a confirmation box to show so that I can check to make sure that a user wishes to send an email.  I have this so far but I am not getting a popup asking for confirmation, any ideas why? - http://pastie.org/10175794
[06:35:53] <Cork> juro: you can't ever wait for ajax calls
[06:36:10] <Cork> juro: you have to build it in a way that it executes the next step based on when the call is done
[06:36:29] <juro> Cork, I am highlighting things that get inserted using multiple $.load functions.
[06:36:37] <Cork> don't use async: false, it causes bad user experience and is depricated in jquery
[06:37:00] <Cork> juro: and you must wait for the next load on each loop?
[06:37:13] <Cork> or just for all $.load to be complete?
[06:39:15] <decx> juro http://jsfiddle.net/333suqdz/
[06:40:30] <Cork> bah, anyone used flot inside an element that exists inside a css columns?
[06:40:37] <Cork> chrome goes bonkers...
[06:41:48] <juro> decx, checking
[06:43:27] <juro> lilalinu_, I though $.load is alway asynchronous?
[06:44:03] <dimi1947> I have attached a display="none" to an input element...how I can make it visible with jquery?
[06:44:17] <decx> .show()
[06:47:20] <blinky_> Guys any ideas why this isnt working - <input type='button' value='Email' id="email">
[06:47:31] <blinky_> http://pastie.org/10175794
[06:52:38] <Cork> blinky_: your code runs before the element exists
[06:52:45] <Cork> you forgot the .ready call
[06:53:32] <Es0teric> is there any way to make a form submit again after data is sent to a form action?
[06:54:14] <silverdust> When we have a self invoking function like (function(){})() I understand what's happening but what's with (function(){})(jQuery) ?
[06:54:29] <silverdust> what difference does it make when there's a jQuery in there
[06:54:47] <Cork> silverdust: none, cause you're example isn't correct
[06:55:02] <Cork> the snippet is (function($) {})(jQuery
[06:55:09] <Cork> )
[06:55:17] <silverdust> oh yea i forgot the dollar sign
[06:55:20] <Cork> and it defined $ == jQuery inside the function
[06:55:49] <Cork> (function($) {})(jQuery) == function tmp($) {}; tmp(jQuery);
[06:56:51] <silverdust> ok that's clear but why would I want to have that?
[06:57:06] <Cork> if you run with $.noConflict()
[06:57:08] <dimi1947> If I wanted to fill with content an input box what method I would use..html() does not work in this case
[06:57:17] <Cork> cause then $ != jQuery in the global scope
[06:57:32] <Cork> silverdust: and it is also the wrapper all jquery plugins should have
[06:57:41] <Cork> (for the same reason)
[06:57:43] <blinky_> Cork: Thank you very much, that worked great, could I ask one otehr question please.  How do I get jquery to follow the link a href has.  For instance I want the link to go to a file called email.php.  The standard link will work fine, with the dialog it does not call it.  Do I have to load it within a jquery function?
[06:57:53] <silverdust> ok I see. Thanks
[06:57:55] <Cork> dimi1947: .val
[06:58:25] <Es0teric> so i have a question -- i have this form that i created and the action i am pointing it to is another form.. is there any way to make php submit the form that the data is being sent to on the action?
[06:58:40] <Cork> blinky_: you mean triggering following the link by script?
[06:59:06] <dimi1947> thanks cork...let me test it now
[06:59:16] <Cork> Es0teric: what?
[06:59:21] <blinky_> Cork: Got it mate, yes that is what I was trying to say.  Don't know if it is the correct way but I have used - window.location.href = "../../php/email.php";
[06:59:23] <Cork> you mean get php to prefill the form?
[06:59:24] <ilhami> it's not possible to have a for loop inside a prepend function right?
[06:59:41] <Cork> blinky_: ya, that is the only way, you can't trigger a click on a link
[06:59:53] <blinky_> Cork: Cheers for the help
[06:59:56] <Cork> ilhami: check the api doc
[07:00:02] <Cork> ?api prepend
[07:00:02] <b-ot> Cork: .prepend(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[07:00:37] <Es0teric> Cork so this is what i meant... user submits form -> form data goes to another form -> force submit form data
[07:00:51] <Cork> O_o
[07:01:03] <Cork> Es0teric: no php can't force actions client side
[07:01:14] <Es0teric> Cork i am saying how to do it in js
[07:01:16] <Es0teric> not php
[07:01:25] <Wes-> you forgot the part where the bowling bowl rolls down the hill to hit the scissors to cut the string that holds the balloon
[07:01:36] <Cork> well php would have to send the prefilled form back as a new page
[07:01:49] <Cork> Es0teric: and then js can do a .submit on the form
[07:01:59] <mcsmurf> hi, I have some javascript/jquery problem with async/promise stuff, my JS knowledge is a bit limited regarding that...maybe my question also belongs to some JS channel ;)
[07:02:31] <mcsmurf> I have pasted my code here: http://jsfiddle.net/678jfhr6/ the problem is: How can I "store"/access the loop variable here so that I can access it later when promise.done is called?
[07:02:41] <Es0teric> Cork ok so i would ajax the form submit
[07:02:46] <Es0teric> then .submit the form again?
[07:02:54] <ilhami> $('#register-form').prepend('<div class="login-error"><article>' + message + '</article></div>'); I need to somehow loop through message since it's an array of strings. :P
[07:03:04] <Cork> Es0teric: why submit it twice??
[07:03:10] <mcsmurf> I want the value of the loop variable at the time getJSON is called
[07:03:39] <Es0teric> Cork because i dont have control over the server the form data is being submitted to
[07:03:49] <Cork> ok?
[07:03:50] <Cork> and?
[07:03:56] <Es0teric> Cork it has to be submitted again
[07:04:01] <Cork> why?
[07:04:04] <Es0teric> because its redirected to another damn form
[07:04:08] <Es0teric> thats why
[07:04:20] <Cork> ah, so you're trying to automate a page?
[07:04:31] <Es0teric> Cork yes
[07:04:46] <Cork> Es0teric: so userscript?
[07:04:49] <Es0teric> Cork yes
[07:04:57] <Cork> ok, so first submit the first page
[07:05:04] <Cork> and on the next page load submit again
[07:05:21] <Cork> just check the url in window.location to identify what action you need to take
[07:07:27] <Es0teric> Cork but how do i do that when the page is on another domain?
[07:08:51] <Cork> Es0teric: if you're using userscript you just load a different script on the other domain
[07:09:06] <Cork> (userscript is loaded in the browser not from a domain)
[07:09:18] <Cork> if you aren't using userscript then you can't do it
[07:09:31] <Cork> as the internet security model is explicitly meant to prevent that
[07:12:47] <silverdust> Cork: I will like to know the best way to turn the invoking function into a variable that still has that global scope of jQuery. From here http://jsfiddle.net/c0m534na/
[07:13:07] <silverdust> I need to call it from documentready and page:load
[07:13:58] <silverdust> The regular way will work in documentready conditions but my SPA framework requires that I use the page:load
[07:15:08] <silverdust> Presently it will only work if a page is freshly loaded not when it is linked from another page
[07:16:33] <silverdust> I don't know if I'm making any sense to you
[07:20:41] <silverdust> I'm only trying to put that in function in the variable ready. I tried, got no errors but it still doesn't show on my page:load conditions
[07:22:36] <silverdust> I came up with this http://jsfiddle.net/c0m534na/1/
[07:23:31] <silverdust> In my app, the page:load line is not commented out and it still fails
[07:24:02] <craftbynick> hi
[07:28:43] <craftbynick> I could use some help if someone is around... I am trying to create a script where if I mouse over any li or div element a button would show and overlay on top of that element
[07:28:55] <craftbynick> kinda similar to this http://jsfiddle.net/kurbhatt/FWG8R/
[07:29:08] <craftbynick> but this only works if the button is there within the div block targeting
[07:29:26] <craftbynick> the button would be placed on the bottom of the page with display: none basically
[07:29:48] <craftbynick> cant seem to figure it out im fairly new to Web Development.  Would appreciate any help I can get.
[07:31:57] <silverdust> craftbynick: I don't get how that fiddle doesn't do what you want
[07:32:18] <craftbynick> it does but the button is placed within the div
[07:32:20] <silverdust> You mousover and it shows the button
[07:32:32] <silverdust> Oh you don't want it placed in at all?
[07:32:38] <silverdust> in the HTML
[07:32:52] <craftbynick> the page im working with has MANY elements existing already I want to be able to place the button at the bottom of the page and still show up within the scope of the div thats targeted on mouseenter basically
[07:33:26] <silverdust> That way you'll have to insert the button with JS and empty the element on mouseout
[07:33:29] <craftbynick> thats where I am getting confused on how to accomplish this basically
[07:33:52] <silverdust> Would you like me to walk you through doing it or I should just do it?
[07:34:15] <craftbynick> no no i want to learn if you can help me by walking me through I would appreciate it
[07:34:42] <craftbynick> the thing im trying to accomplish is basically the exact same as pinterest
[07:34:54] <silverdust> ok first. The mark-up is wrong. You should just have <div class="divbutton"></div>
[07:34:57] <craftbynick> where if you mouse over a div block in pinterest you get the pinit button and the share button etc
[07:35:05] <silverdust> You can leave your CSS as is
[07:35:54] <craftbynick> I would need to style the button at a later stage through css im assuming
[07:36:27] <craftbynick> thanks btw silverdust
[07:36:36] <silverdust> In the JS, $(this).find(":button").show() should be replaced with $(this).html('<button>Hello</button>');
[07:37:13] <silverdust> then $(this).find(":button").hide() should be $(this).html('');
[07:37:19] <craftbynick> would it be helpful if i showed you the page i am working with?
[07:37:29] <silverdust> ok that's fine
[07:37:41] <silverdust> but have you tried those changes?
[07:38:12] <craftbynick> not yet I am about to but wanted to show you the page first if thats ok
[07:38:19] <silverdust> ok
[07:38:27] <craftbynick> https://www.tiaa-cref.org/public/index.html
[07:38:33] <craftbynick> on that page basically
[07:38:41] <craftbynick> each of the div elements there
[07:39:08] <craftbynick> if i mouse over it should basically take the height and the width of that div element itself and add a button called TAG
[07:39:42] <craftbynick> the idea is if i click on TAG it will simply add a tag with the page URL of the TAG in a JSON file which would be used to create a list on a seperate page
[07:40:24] <silverdust> where is to be hovered there?
[07:40:33] <craftbynick> any div element
[07:40:38] <craftbynick> so for example on the right
[07:40:41] <craftbynick> Fund Watch
[07:41:00] <craftbynick> if i hover on top it each line items would have a button appearing
[07:41:07] <craftbynick> similar to pinterest
[07:41:37] <silverdust> ok if you can figure it out from the fiddle, I believe you should be able to replicate it similarly there
[07:41:39] <craftbynick> I am basically trying to mimic the pinterest's pinit functionality to a certain extent
[07:42:25] <xqo> if i want to change what value shows when i console.log(myObject), i change the toString() method of myObject?
[07:42:53] <silverdust> ok. Just try the fiddle changes
[07:43:16] <craftbynick> trying now
[07:46:27] <craftbynick> hummm
[07:46:28] <craftbynick> http://jsfiddle.net/FWG8R/256/
[07:46:37] <craftbynick> seems like that is working
[07:47:20] <craftbynick> wow I feel like an idiot now it was as simple as just adding button from jQuery instead of showing and hiding an existing button on html... thanks soo much!
[07:48:27] <silverdust> That's not working here. Why didn't you take out hte old code
[07:48:42] <silverdust> Nothing's changed in your JS
[07:48:57] <silverdust> perhaps you didn't save the fiddle properly and it works for you
[07:49:32] <craftbynick> I may have given the wrong URL
[07:49:34] <craftbynick> http://jsfiddle.net/FWG8R/257/
[07:50:26] <silverdust> ok good
[07:51:23] <craftbynick> so if my logic is correct, once the button is added on top of the div using $(this).html('<button>Tagit</button>'); I can then add a class to this as well and style it within CSS?  Once thus button is clicked it would need to retrieve the page URL and save it in a JSON file basically.  So everyting would essentially contain within the mouseenter block?
[07:52:47] <silverdust> yes. The CSS styles the DOM not just the HTML so it will add styles to nodes that were dynamically added
[07:53:19] <decx> i wouldnt add and remove elements just willy nilly on mouseevents
[07:53:38] <craftbynick> so if an element is added via jQuery the browser will still fetch the style properties and add it on the fly?
[07:53:50] <decx> browser doesnt care
[07:55:04] <silverdust> decx: You think he should just make a variable with the html and check if it exists to hide or show or insert if it doesn't exist?
[07:55:38] <decx> yeah basicly
[07:55:54] <silverdust> I thought so but I thought it may be a longer process :D
[07:56:05] <silverdust> I believe its best anyway
[07:56:07] <decx> it is
[07:56:36] <decx> but adding and remove elements on mouseevents is dirty :>
[07:57:59] <silverdust> yea especially if the added elment will be taking a lot of attributes. craftbynick are you ok with that or you want to be a web hero?
[08:00:42] <marcusdei> this site: http://easywebsitevoorbeeld.nl/proto1/
[08:01:10] <marcusdei> I would like the sticky menu to be the standard menu
[08:01:16] <marcusdei> any idea?
[08:01:29] <marcusdei> I can't access the FTP
[08:01:45] <craftbynick> sorry about that just one moment please
[08:02:04] <notchris> Iâ€™m trying to do an ajax load
[08:02:16] <notchris> However, Iâ€™m getting a cors error
[08:02:26] <notchris> Although, the headers on the requested resource are correct
[08:02:38] <notchris> How could this be?
[08:02:38] <decx> craftbynick:   here's a quick example where you only add once, it's the power of data() http://jsfiddle.net/FWG8R/261/
[08:06:01] <craftbynick> decx: I dont understand what the data method does
[08:06:08] <craftbynick> seems complicated lol but interesting
[08:06:40] <decx> let me comment that out
[08:07:11] <silverdust> why this .data('button', tag) ?
[08:07:24] <craftbynick> silverdust: Not quiet sure what you mean by web hero... I am a student and trying to learn as quickly as I can and perfect my skills... hoping to be a MEAN stack dev.
[08:07:33] <silverdust> Isn't that adding the html as a data-attribute value
[08:08:18] <decx> there you go
[08:08:18] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/FWG8R/263/
[08:09:21] <craftbynick> ahh so on line 7 basically its creating an object which is a button thus making it easier to add properties to it if im correct?
[08:09:33] <decx> yeah that's the preferred way
[08:09:44] <decx> html(<stringsoup>) can get hard to maintain
[08:10:13] <craftbynick> ah ok so the reason is maintainability but its not a performance hit of any kind
[08:10:22] <decx> not on this scale
[08:10:29] <decx> but it's good practise
[08:10:56] <craftbynick> but with this method how would I associate button click functionality so that I can grab the page URL and add it to a JSON file which other pages can use to generate a list of tags?
[08:11:03] <JohnDow> how do i throw an error to an ajax call from Php server?
[08:11:28] <silverdust> craftbynick: just give it an id or class and listen for its click event
[08:11:31] <decx> you can delegate the button click from your static parent
[08:12:36] <JohnDow> decx?
[08:12:41] <decx> no
[08:13:05] <decx> send the appropriate status from your server JohnDow
[08:13:30] <JohnDow> ok just tell me then how would i handle this scenario
[08:13:35] <decx> craftbynick: there's also the option to set the event when creating and element as described here http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#example-1-1
[08:13:35] <marcusdei> this site: http://easywebsitevoorbeeld.nl/proto1/
[08:13:39] <silverdust> On rails you could send a 503 status easily
[08:13:46] <marcusdei> I would like to disable the standard header
[08:13:58] <marcusdei> and just have the sticky header there on page laod
[08:14:04] <marcusdei> any tips pls ?
[08:14:33] <JohnDow> im making an ajax call, then even if the server returns a false or error or whatever my upload bar still shows
[08:14:56] <JohnDow> i thought i should return an error status from server
[08:16:10] <silverdust> If you want that, you should ask in ##php on how to return HTTP status codes
[08:16:45] <JohnDow> i'm asking if that's the proper way or what if not
[08:17:39] <craftbynick> decx: is this right? http://jsfiddle.net/FWG8R/266/  I added another attribute on line 10 while adding a new function to check for click event on the button with the id added from line 10
[08:18:10] <decx> look at the example like from the api i posted
[08:18:25] <decx> link
[08:18:45] <craftbynick> ok checking now
[08:18:46] <decx> you can add events inside the element creation
[08:19:14] <decx> also id would be faulty since every divbutton div would create a button with the same id making it invalid
[08:20:15] <craftbynick> oh, i created an id because I was under the impression on mouseout the created element is destroyed and a new one is created so at any given time there would only be one id on the page
[08:20:16] <JohnDow> can't join the ##php
[08:20:26] <decx> i think that's invite only
[08:21:03] <decx> or was it just for registered people
[08:21:26] <decx> yeah you need to be identified JohnDow
[08:21:54] <JohnDow> i'll just ask for help here instead
[08:22:06] <silverdust> only registered users use ##php
[08:22:16] <NoiseEee> (11:14:33 AM) JohnDow: im making an ajax call, then even if the server returns a false or error or whatever my upload bar still shows
[08:22:33] <NoiseEee> ^^ then write something to deal with xhr failures/errors that removes the upload bar
[08:22:59] <JohnDow> it's not bad to have the server do the validation right? even if it's an ajax call
[08:23:02] <JohnDow> or nah?
[08:23:17] <NoiseEee> server side *always* needs to validate
[08:23:25] <NoiseEee> client side is helpful for UI etc
[08:23:42] <JohnDow> yes that's what on my mind. I'm done doing my server stuff
[08:23:48] <JohnDow> so now im trying to do ajax
[08:24:15] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ see the part about jqXHR.fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {});
[08:24:39] <NoiseEee> so when there's an error, you say "bad info you terrible person" and hide the upload bar / etc etc
[08:24:52] <JohnDow> should i return false from server so my success function wont get fired up? or should i do IF's in my success function on what the server replied?
[08:25:14] <NoiseEee> it depends
[08:25:17] <JohnDow> those two is the possible solution i could think of
[08:25:54] <NoiseEee> its really up to you.  some people say 'the xhr itself was fine, i'm returning a 200/OK and JSON like: {"status":"fail","error":"failed validation"}' or something
[08:26:27] <JohnDow> #codeigniter seems to be busy right now, they always give me good advice
[08:26:35] <NoiseEee> others like to actually send a failed server response code, but you have to work a bit harder at creating a sensible error message that is helpful to your user
[08:26:45] <craftbynick> decx: Oh wow I am really starting to understand the structure here... this is amazing stuff thanks soo much http://jsfiddle.net/FWG8R/269/
[08:27:22] <decx> o/ high five
[08:28:02] <JohnDow> hmmm
[08:28:24] <JohnDow> NoiseEee what do you use often in this kind of case?
[08:28:26] <poseidon> Is there a way to do a post without it being ajax?
[08:28:41] <NoiseEee> poseidon: a regular/traditional form submission
[08:29:02] <craftbynick> decx: btw is it possible the find an exact location on the page without editing the html?  meaning if i click on tagit it will grab the url and the exact location itself so end user does not need to scroll when the tag is clicked from the tag page?
[08:29:50] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: if the xhr request is just going to a resource that only my app/site consumers, I tend to send back a 200 with an error key. if the resource is a consumable API, I usually send back an http status code about an error of some sort.
[08:29:58] <NoiseEee> s/consumers/consumes
[08:31:50] <decx> i don get that craftbynick :>
[08:32:55] <JohnDow> NoiseEee i didn't follow you when you said consumable API
[08:32:59] <craftbynick> decx: basically what I mean is instead of simply grabbing the URL of the page on click which I would possible use var url      = window.location.href; for is it possible to location the exact location as well?
[08:33:22] <decx> this.offsetTop this.offsetLeft
[08:33:38] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: if (on the back end) your script is going to return data / act as an API / handle requests for clients other than this specific call from your front end
[08:33:55] <craftbynick> decx: meaning if the page is very long and with this tag which would be listed on another page almost like a bookmark it would lead the end user directly to the page where its tagged and the exact location essentially and avoid the need to scroll down etc
[08:34:29] <JohnDow> well since i'm using codeigniter which is an MVC,....
[08:34:35] <decx> either create a unique id and use that as hash
[08:34:45] <decx> or save teh offset and set scrollTop to that
[08:35:14] <JohnDow> so i guess I should return an error response NoiseEee ?? rather than ok.
[08:35:33] <craftbynick> hum i may need to check a tutorial to understand the concept of hash i think first
[08:35:33] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: sure, just make sure your front end knows what to do
[08:36:30] <JohnDow> okie dokie, thanks for clearing up ;) hi 5 0/
[08:40:13] <decx> down low o_
[08:44:36] <Expel> Is this line right? $('#container, #support-menu').css('min-height', winheight); or should it be like this: $('#container, #support-menu').css('min-height', winheight+'px');
[08:46:24] <decx> css() will add px automagically
[08:46:55] <Expel> decx: So the first one is right?
[08:47:04] <Expel> And should work, right?
[08:47:11] <decx> well both will work
[08:48:01] <decx> for example with line-height css() wouldn't add px
[08:48:04] <decx> it's weird
[08:48:18] <decx> but min-height will do just fine
[08:48:32] <decx> maybe that line-height thing is a bug though
[08:48:54] <decx> probably not because it's rarely px with text
[08:49:02] <Expel> decx: Alright, weird since nothing is adding in html code....
[08:49:23] <decx> isolate the issue and try to reproduce on fiddle
[08:49:36] <decx> that whole process will probably lead you to your answer ^^
[08:55:10] <Expel> decx: Oh... God... It was in my functions.php where the problem was... However, the script tag had the same name, lol I was in a hurry before so didn't really point it out until the whole website started to look weird, lol.
[08:55:39] <decx> that's what you get for using wordpress
[08:55:50] <Expel> decx: Yep, I guess so, hehe.
[08:58:32] <craftbynick> decx: I actually made a small update to the script however its not working as intended, instead of hiding the button via css I added a mouseout function that finds and removes buttons with a specific id however its removing once, but if i mouse over it again it's not adding the button back in... kind weird.. http://jsfiddle.net/FWG8R/274/
[08:59:31] <decx> obviously because added is true and it never runs again
[08:59:41] <decx> now you're back to square one where you add and remove all the time
[09:02:17] <craftbynick> hum... i'm assuming I may have to run another if statement within the mouseout function something along the line of if(status == true){} ?

[09:11:08] <uskerine> anyone uses formvalidation.io under bootstrap?
[09:16:22] <craftbynick> decx: not quite sure if im understanding here
[09:25:20] <Es0teric> how do you get the data from a form submit in jquery?
[09:25:26] <Es0teric> as in all of the POST data
[09:32:15] <uskerine> is it possible to validate using external AJAX service (in particular I want to check for "username"already exists via AJAX) using FormValidation.io?
[09:32:22] <uskerine> I have seen this: http://formvalidation.io/validators/remote/
[09:32:24] <rmill> Es0teric: $.post('path/to/thing/', function(data) { console.log(data); }); ?
[09:32:34] <Es0teric> rmill i am grabbing data using ajax
[09:32:36] <uskerine> but I am using declarative
[09:32:52] <uskerine> Es0teric, you mean response from POST?
[09:33:08] <uskerine> you want to grab response from POST
[09:33:32] <Es0teric> uskerine yes
[09:33:37] <Es0teric> no not a response
[09:33:39] <Es0teric> i am sending the data
[09:33:41] <Es0teric> not recieving it
[09:34:02] <rmill> are you sure the response is coming back?
[09:34:09] <uskerine> Es0teric
[09:34:28] <uskerine> with firebug under firefox you will see all your AJAX requests, including POSTs with their data
[09:34:33] <uskerine> I use it for debugging
[09:34:42] <Es0teric> uskerine to send post data i can just target the form id
[09:34:47] <Es0teric> and it will grab all of the post data from there right
[09:34:50] <Es0teric> ?
[09:34:58] <uskerine> yes, when you submit a form
[09:35:04] <uskerine> all the input fields will be included
[09:35:07] <Es0teric> uskerine ok thats what i was looking for
[09:35:12] <uskerine> my recommendation is to use FireBug
[09:35:20] <uskerine> it will help a lot to see what is happening without having to code anything extra
[09:35:25] <uskerine> just go to the NET tab
[09:35:28] <uskerine> and see what's going on there
[09:37:50] <JohnDow> how do i use variable names in my ajax data? it uses the name of my variable instead of what's the content of my variable
[09:37:50] <Es0teric> uskerine ok quick question
[09:38:01] <Es0teric> how do i get rid of the 'same origin policy' error?
[09:41:23] <rmill> Es0teric: use CORS
[09:41:32] <rmill> or, send the data from the same origin
[09:41:33] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: pastebin
[09:42:01] <Es0teric> rmill how do i use cors with ajax?
[09:42:07] <Es0teric> this is something i have not done yet
[09:42:27] <JohnDow> http://www.hastebin.com/imonafexoc.xml
[09:43:14] <JohnDow> im also trying to put the response of my ajax to global variable
[09:44:02] <rmill> Es0teric: do you have control over where the form is? you can't submit data to a form from another origin unless it's supported
[09:44:15] <rmill> or rather, where the data is being processed ?
[09:44:16] <Es0teric> rmill no i do not have control where the form is
[09:44:24] <Es0teric> no i do not have control over any of that
[09:44:25] <uskerine> Es0teric, you can POST against same machine, and initiate another request in the backend
[09:44:33] <uskerine> sort kind of AJAX service PROXY
[09:44:54] <uskerine> as backend you can use whatever you like, PHP, Java, Python
[09:45:05] <notchris> Iâ€™m trying to allow CORS
[09:45:11] <notchris> Even though the headers are identical
[09:45:14] <notchris> It will not allow it
[09:45:38] <JohnDow> NoiseEee ??
[09:46:12] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: whats the issue exactly?
[09:46:34] <JohnDow> i can't store the ajax response to global variable
[09:47:06] <NoiseEee> well one issue I can see is that you need to understand XHR/ajax is asynchronous
[09:47:31] <rmill> Es0teric: posting data to a from via ajax is usually something that's done in an application where both the request/api live on the same sub/domain/port etc.
[09:47:56] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: so on that example, its quite likely that your ajax call to products/add is happening before you even get a "token"
[09:48:13] <JohnDow> hmm, i'll lock it out?
[09:48:17] <JohnDow> async: false?
[09:48:55] <NoiseEee> no
[09:48:57] <JohnDow> or what?
[09:48:59] <NoiseEee> embrace javacript
[09:49:03] <NoiseEee> embrace async
[09:49:08] <NoiseEee> use callbacks and/or promises
[09:50:43] <JohnDow> pastebin/hastebin?
[09:52:01] <NoiseEee> its too much for what I can offer you right now (I'm too busy) but you need to break those functions up
[09:52:29] <JohnDow> owie :\

[09:57:30] <Terminus> hello. question, is there an event i can use to handle location.href changes? specifically i want to handle it depending on whether '#' is in the url or not.
[09:57:44] <notchris> NoiseEee: It does...
[09:57:53] <rmill> Terminus: yes
[09:57:56] <rmill> onhashchange
[09:58:18] <notchris> NoiseEee: http://puu.sh/hES9d/fec837a662.png
[09:58:35] <rmill> Terminus: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/hashchange/
[09:58:58] <Terminus> rmill: thanks!
[09:59:33] <rmill> Terminus: do you need to detect when it changes, or _just_ if it's there?
[09:59:52] <JohnDow> NoiseEee now i understand from the link you gave me. thanks
[09:59:53] <JohnDow> demn
[10:00:06] <notchris> NoiseEee: So what could the issue be.
[10:00:11] <JohnDow> i'm used to php, that's the way i do it there hahahaha.
[10:00:55] <NoiseEee> notchris: hmmm do you send the "withCredentials" in your request?
[10:01:27] <Terminus> rmill: i need to detect changes. i want to add a class to a particular element if there's no hash and then remove the class once there's a hash.
[10:01:38] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/hashchange
[10:02:21] <rmill> Terminus: yea, that link I pasted and the one robertmaxrees pasted should be good, then!
[10:02:23] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: np... async nature of various JS stuff can get tricky/messy
[10:02:36] <uskerine> Did anyone use remote validation (FormValidation.io) using declarative HTML params? (-instead of using .JS-)
[10:02:39] <notchris> NoiseEee: Still no luck
[10:02:52] <JohnDow> demn that means i cant reuse functions that just do this single stuff cause ajax is async
[10:02:55] <robertmaxrees> Terminus actually, check this out: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onhashchange
[10:02:55] <NoiseEee> notchris: maybe pastebin your xhr request?
[10:02:57] <Terminus> rmill, robertmaxrees: thanks! i'm a bit outdated when it comes to the new stuff available with html5. =D
[10:03:00] <uskerine> I can use it for "nonempty" and other basic stuff but I can't find how to use remote validation
[10:03:06] <notchris> NoiseEee: That should not matter
[10:03:07] <robertmaxrees> Terminus hashchange is oooold
[10:03:11] <robertmaxrees> IE8 and above.
[10:03:16] <notchris> NoiseEee: It says it cannot find the Allow Access Control
[10:03:19] <notchris> But it is visibly there
[10:03:24] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: sure you can; in that example, instead of writing "console.log()" in the success callback, you can refer to a function that calls console.log
[10:03:28] <Terminus> robertmaxrees: yeah, i figure i can just use that with $(window).on('hashchange')...
[10:03:45] <robertmaxrees> Terminus i'd use window.onhashchange = funcRef; instead.
[10:03:52] <robertmaxrees> no need to "jquery it"
[10:03:58] <Terminus> robertmaxrees: yeah, i never kept up with changes beyond html4, css2.1, etc.
[10:04:08] <NoiseEee> notchris: it does matter, afaik you need to include   xhrFields: {'withCredentials': true} in your XHR request
[10:04:08] <danpsy> With contentType and processData both set to false, my posted data array is empty. If I disable these; the posted content is there as expected. Anyway I can troubleshoot this? http://ideone.com/XoZpo2
[10:04:16] <Terminus> robertmaxrees: just want to keep things consistent since the majority of the code is in jquery anyway.
[10:04:25] <JohnDow> well, how do i tell a function what callback it should call?
[10:04:27] <notchris> NoiseEee: I did that
[10:04:33] <Terminus> don't want to end up with frankenstein looking code.
[10:05:03] <robertmaxrees> Terminus it's all javascript in the end, and there's literally no need to use jquery to bind to that event, but okay.
[10:05:04] <notchris> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/RhaK6qrS
[10:05:32] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: you could, for example, make it a parameter in your 'requestToken' function,  so you'd have osmething like "success:function(data) { param(data);}"
[10:05:44] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: JS lets you pass functions/function references as parameters
[10:06:09] <NoiseEee> function requestToken(callbackFunction) {   //etc    callbackFunction(someData); }
[10:06:18] <JohnDow> wait i'll hastebin it so i could understand clearly
[10:06:51] <JohnDow> http://www.hastebin.com/ipowumoyim.xml
[10:07:12] <NoiseEee> notchris: also:  crossDomain: true
[10:07:14] <JohnDow> after calling the requestToken i want to the next ajax call as the callback
[10:07:31] <JohnDow> after the 2 console.log
[10:08:04] <notchris> NoiseEee: Still no luck
[10:10:42] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: something like http://www.hastebin.com/aqefozoput.xml
[10:11:38] <JohnDow> now that's better, so there's a callback caller function
[10:12:23] <uskerine> I have a webservice (API) which checks for a user in database and returns true or false if found or not. This requires a given field to be provided "user" so the query can be performed against database.
[10:12:30] <uskerine> What the service should do if that field is not provided?
[10:12:35] <NoiseEee> notchris: <shrug> i think thats technically all that you need :|
[10:12:42] <notchris> Sigh
[10:12:46] <notchris> TY for trying
[10:12:56] <notchris> Is anyone else familiar with CORS ?
[10:13:28] <robertmaxrees> i am.
[10:13:34] <robertmaxrees> whatcha need.
[10:13:43] <NoiseEee> uskerine: a traditional REST API setup would be  https://yourSite.com/users/<userToken>   or https://yourSite.com/users/<userName>
[10:14:10] <NoiseEee> uskerine: that returns a 404 (not "false") when the user doesn't exist, and a similar error code when no token/name is sent
[10:14:27] <NoiseEee> thus ends my #jquery blitz; back to work, good luck all
[10:14:33] <robertmaxrees> *boom*
[10:14:54] <uskerine> so your suggestion would be that it should return 404
[10:15:02] <uskerine> which is basically it should fail at HTTP level
[10:15:06] <NoiseEee> uskerine: exactly... not found
[10:15:07] <uskerine> should it be 404 or other code?
[10:15:50] <uskerine> actually it should be Bad request 400
[10:16:29] <NoiseEee> i think the 400 should be when no user token/name is supplied, yes, but 404 when the user can't be found
[10:16:32] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I have two domains with the correct headers
[10:16:41] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Still getting a CORS error
[10:17:05] <notchris> robertmaxrees: https://www.ctsciencecenter.org/tickets-peo/
[10:17:15] <uskerine> 400 = The request had bad syntax or was inherently impossible to be satisfied.
[10:17:16] <notchris> The error is on that page, you can see that itâ€™s not able to request the page
[10:17:26] <notchris> However, looking at the page, youll see the headers are correct
[10:17:30] <uskerine> which would be the case, I am waiting for field "user", you don't provide, I can't provide your request
[10:17:31] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so first off, the only server that actually matetrs here is the one you're making the request to.  e.g. -> the URL you're pointing to with AJAX.
[10:17:45] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Right, and the headers exist there
[10:18:06] <uskerine> NoiseEee, for user present or not, i must adhere to sending a JSON object, as that's what frontend expects
[10:18:07] <robertmaxrees> what's the URL you're trying to request?
[10:18:28] <robertmaxrees> ticket.ctsciencecenter.org ?
[10:18:31] <notchris> https://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/
[10:18:37] <JohnDow> NoiseEee, i just followed the hastebin you sent me, the second request/callback is not writing the console.log()
[10:18:54] <notchris> Which has these headers: http://puu.sh/hES9d/fec837a662.png
[10:19:16] <robertmaxrees> notchris there's a redirect happening somewhere.
[10:19:33] <robertmaxrees> because http://i.imgur.com/3XZbr1j.png is what i see.
[10:19:49] <notchris> What do you see?
[10:19:55] <robertmaxrees> ^ look at the image.
[10:20:00] <robertmaxrees> see what's missing?
[10:20:19] <notchris> I donâ€™t see the image
[10:20:27] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/3XZbr1j.png
[10:20:31] <notchris> Itâ€™s appearing blank
[10:20:38] <robertmaxrees> that's blank to you?
[10:20:46] <notchris> http://puu.sh/hETuh/d406ece7ea.png
[10:20:53] <JohnDow> i can see it
[10:20:59] <notchris> I see everyone elses
[10:21:14] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:21:17] <robertmaxrees> open the actual URL.
[10:21:17] <notchris> How can I prevent a redirect
[10:21:22] <robertmaxrees> that's your client freakng out.
[10:21:26] <notchris> Hmm
[10:22:06] <robertmaxrees> either way - http://fixee.org/paste/4t2966m/
[10:22:08] <robertmaxrees> does this work?
[10:22:12] <notchris> Youâ€™re right
[10:22:25] <notchris> I wonder how to find out where the redirect is happening
[10:22:34] <robertmaxrees> take a look at that fiddle.
[10:22:40] <robertmaxrees> err, fixee.
[10:23:36] <notchris> WHAT
[10:23:38] <notchris> It works now
[10:23:48] <JohnDow> why is my second callback complete(or)success not writing on the console
[10:23:48] <JohnDow> http://www.hastebin.com/itomebosed.xml
[10:24:07] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Sigh, once again, youâ€™ve proved me wrong
[10:24:09] <notchris> :/
[10:24:12] <notchris> Thank you
[10:24:50] <JohnDow> any clue?
[10:27:38] <robertmaxrees> notchris hahahaha it's not about proving people wrong.
[10:28:37] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I know, you just always know whatâ€™s going on
[10:29:29] <robertmaxrees> JohnDow context.
[10:29:32] <robertmaxrees> how are you calling these?
[10:29:43] <JohnDow> like this (wait for the link)
[10:30:03] <JohnDow> http://www.hastebin.com/pudoqedozo.coffee
[10:30:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah so you need to tell requestToken what callback it should call.
[10:30:55] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other function.
[10:31:08] <robertmaxrees> requestToken(preValidate); should work.
[10:31:21] <JohnDow> oops demn -_- stupid, i forgot to put it there
[10:31:39] <juro> decx, sorry for dropping, power went out :)
[10:32:03] <JohnDow> still not writing on console
[10:33:43] <robertmaxrees> JohnDow add in the error callback to that first ajax call: http://fixee.org/paste/b01xg4p/
[10:33:49] <robertmaxrees> see if that logs "broken"
[10:33:59] <JohnDow> i did complete instead. thanks
[10:34:07] <NoiseEee> JohnDow: you should also be familiar with your console and actually able to see your XHR requests/responses in the appropriate place
[10:34:10] <robertmaxrees> complete() is not a good choice fwiw.
[10:34:33] <JohnDow> hmm well, since i already asked here
[10:34:39] <robertmaxrees> complete runs regardless of whether or not it actually succeeded.
[10:34:48] <JohnDow> for testing purposes only
[10:35:30] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[10:35:31] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:35:32] <JohnDow> my form gets submitted even though before submit is not done yet
[10:35:35] <JohnDow> is that normal?
[10:35:36] <JohnDow> http://www.hastebin.com/lecucohiqa.xml
[10:35:43] <JohnDow> i'll change it after this
[10:35:55] <robertmaxrees> ajax.
[10:36:03] <robertmaxrees> ajax fires and doens't make anything wait.
[10:36:13] <JohnDow> well what's the beforesubmit for then?
[10:36:37] <robertmaxrees> to do things before submission.
[10:36:45] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about the ajax role in this.
[10:37:08] <robertmaxrees> beforesubmit finishes before the form submits, but because you're firing ajax, the browser keeps going - it's asynchronous.
[10:37:28] <JohnDow> so i set the async to false? would that let the prevalidation finish?
[10:37:53] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[10:37:57] <robertmaxrees> you'll freeze the browser.
[10:38:07] <JohnDow> i need to validate first before submitting the form, the validation code  in the server is done already
[10:38:30] <robertmaxrees> prevent the default submit, validate, then submit as per usual.
[10:39:13] <JohnDow> ok so i'll do the pre validation first before going to the actual submit function O.o am i correct?
[10:39:19] <robertmaxrees> one sec i'll show you.
[10:39:26] <robertmaxrees> you're making this overly complicated :)
[10:39:51] <JohnDow> well since im a long time php programmer, im new to this js stuffs
[10:40:03] <robertmaxrees> you're not thinking about the async nature.
[10:40:18] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you the basic idea.
[10:40:59] <JohnDow> yes i know async runs asynchronously , it's just that  i thought beforesubmit has it's literal meaning that it would finish first before the actual submission
[10:41:10] <robertmaxrees> the code DOES finish running.
[10:41:25] <robertmaxrees> but you're running an ajax call, so the ajax call fires.
[10:42:38] <JohnDow> i'll wait for the code you're telling me
[10:42:53] <robertmaxrees> it'll look something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/cubsrvz/
[10:43:00] <robertmaxrees> i assume you're not submitting the form via ajax, right?
[10:43:15] <robertmaxrees> (that code may not actually work btw, it's just to give you the basic gist.
[10:44:17] <robertmaxrees> i was late so the whole $('form').on('submit', function(e, isValidated) { might be different depending on what you're actually doing.
[10:44:18] <JohnDow> ok i got the idea, but that does not mean i get it running instantly
[10:44:37] <JohnDow> im using the ajaxform plugim
[10:44:45] <robertmaxrees> show me all of your current code.
[10:44:50] <robertmaxrees> instead of rough snippets.
[10:44:58] <robertmaxrees> the ajax form stuff i mean.
[10:45:31] <JohnDow> there: http://www.hastebin.com/welixafera.coffee
[10:46:07] <robertmaxrees> woah, yeah.
[10:46:14] <robertmaxrees> you're really convoluting this.
[10:46:48] <JohnDow> for short im stuck hahaha
[10:47:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're going to have all kinds of race conditions.
[10:47:09] <JohnDow> code's working if form is not submitted with ajax
[10:47:36] <robertmaxrees> right because you're not thinking in terms of ajax.
[10:47:38] <JohnDow> demn, helping hand please?
[10:47:55] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm doing now duder.
[10:47:57] <robertmaxrees> http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#api
[10:48:02] <JohnDow> i just tried adding ajax to my form now to make it look nicer
[10:48:02] <robertmaxrees> you basically need to wire this all yourself.
[10:48:42] <JohnDow> demn
[10:49:09] <robertmaxrees> why not just generate the token on pageload?
[10:49:16] <robertmaxrees> why are you generating on demand like that?
[10:49:18] <JohnDow> if i couldn't really do this i'll just take it out my page. -_- :\
[10:49:24] <JohnDow> csrf token is regenerating
[10:49:26] <robertmaxrees> you can do it,
[10:49:30] <JohnDow> every form submissino
[10:49:33] <robertmaxrees> you just need to understand what you're doing.
[10:51:08] <JohnDow> im really stuck
[10:51:25] <robertmaxrees> so then let's build it together :D
[10:51:27] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty easy.
[10:51:44] <JohnDow> it's easy cause you've been doing this unlike me :\
[10:51:54] <robertmaxrees> right, now you have an expert helping you :)
[10:51:59] <JohnDow> yey!
[10:52:01] <JohnDow> <3 hahaha
[10:52:09] <JohnDow> appreciating it like a kid
[10:52:34] <JohnDow> ok so, first what do i do? get the token right?
[10:52:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:52:51] <robertmaxrees> the first thing is to get right of the ajax form plugin.
[10:53:04] <robertmaxrees> that's causing some of your headaches.
[10:53:07] <JohnDow> get rid of it?
[10:53:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  we're not going to use it.
[10:53:41] <JohnDow> hmm what if on form submit i'll do other functions first then just call that when everything's done?
[10:53:48] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to work.
[10:53:49] <robertmaxrees> ajax.
[10:54:15] <robertmaxrees> your entire problem is that you're not grokking the underlying async nature of ajax
[10:54:19] <robertmaxrees> we're going to fix that.
[10:54:35] <JohnDow> ok i'll try to embrace the async nature
[10:54:39] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:54:40] <JohnDow> ok i'll get rid of it
[10:55:08] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/b01xg4p/#url=jv21pjj
[10:55:12] <robertmaxrees> you want something roughly like this.
[10:55:15] <robertmaxrees> take a look at it.
[10:56:36] <JohnDow> i understand the flow but where did you got this? function(e, isValidated)
[10:57:00] <robertmaxrees> you have to read the docs for .on() and .trigger() :)
[10:57:27] <JohnDow> i'll take a quick look
[10:59:21] <JohnDow> got it
[11:00:10] <JohnDow> what's next?
[11:01:02] <robertmaxrees> try the code.
[11:01:10] <robertmaxrees> fix up what breaks.
[11:01:46] <JohnDow> i would like to have a progress bar that's why i used the plugin from the first place. I think it's kinda hard without it
[11:05:16] <robertmaxrees> we can fix that later.
[11:05:16] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:06:24] <JohnDow> problem robert
[11:06:45] <JohnDow> tokenName uses that name, it's supposed to be the generated token name
[11:12:01] <JohnDow> i used inline php again to generate it instead
[11:13:29] <Zeranoe> How could I append a row to a table when a user inputs something into the first column of the last row?
[11:14:01] <Zeranoe> So that the table grows to whatever size is needed
[11:14:53] <decx> from your input event, target the tbody or whatever you use and then create a new row
[11:14:59] <decx> have you tried?
[11:22:02] <JohnDow> demn, ajax is not for me i guess
[11:22:59] <robertmaxrees> hah and i just got back.
[11:23:12] <LiENUS> i have a selector that looks like $('#addnew input,#addnew select') would $('#addnew').find('input, select') be a better way of writing that?
[11:23:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:23:28] <LiENUS> and it'll mean the same thing?
[11:23:30] <robertmaxrees> using .find() is generally better period.
[11:23:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:23:45] <LiENUS> wasnt sure if the syntax would get wonky by using the ,
[11:23:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.  .find() takes any selector.
[11:24:22] <LiENUS> its just like using that selector on a smaller document containing only #addnews children then?
[11:24:37] <robertmaxrees> not on a "Smaller document", but sort of.
[11:25:50] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/find/ explains it.
[11:33:18] <xqo> how can i delete a property from only one instance of an object? using "delete" also deletes the property from all other instances http://jsfiddle.net/uf522v3a/
[11:33:30] <notchris> robertmaxrees: So I am able to use the ajax request now, however, I cannot get the page in question
[11:33:47] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Although the parameters for the page are correct, it only loads the first page
[11:34:12] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Iâ€™m requesting: https://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/show_events_list.asp?shcode=1&shName=General+Admission
[11:34:19] <robertmaxrees> xqo you're confused about how object instances work.
[11:34:27] <notchris> robertmaxrees: But it returns the content of https://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/default.asp
[11:34:45] <robertmaxrees> xqo var test = dict; just points the var test to dict
[11:35:18] <robertmaxrees> also: i just want to announce that donny osmond is in my office right now.
[11:35:20] <robertmaxrees> so that's happening.
[11:36:16] <Zeranoe> How do I bind to the event of entering text into a textbox? change() works, but it requires you deselect the input
[11:36:32] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe .on('input') for newer browsers.
[11:36:51] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Any options for older?
[11:37:16] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe do you need IE8?
[11:37:22] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Yes
[11:37:56] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe i'd check keyup maybe?
[11:38:06] <limpc> has anyone here used jplist?
[11:38:28] <robertmaxrees> limpc somebody might be able to help even if they haven't :)
[11:38:51] <limpc> well its pretty specific to jplist and would require someone familiar with it
[11:39:00] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[11:39:03] <robertmaxrees> WELL ALRIGHT.
[11:39:03] <limpc> im having trouble getting it to work with a table.
[11:39:21] <limpc> and i dont get why the plugin requires a container to initialize on  instead of the table itself
[11:42:24] <limpc> http://jsfiddle.net/L9p64/4/
[11:42:40] <robertmaxrees> will nobody knows jplist so apparently nobody can help you.
[11:42:42] <robertmaxrees> :(
[12:05:06] <Zeranoe> I'm trying to grow a table dynamically based on if the user has entered data into the last row. I have it growing, but the selection method:  $( ".item" ).filter( ":last" ).focus(function() { .. binds to an input and does not move down as the table grows. Any ideas on this?
[12:05:31] <robertmaxrees> can you show an example?
[12:05:34] <robertmaxrees> with html?
[12:05:42] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: I'll come up with something
[12:07:33] <mathu> using jquery's validate plugin. under what circumstances would calling `$('#element').rules()` result in a type error: `TypeError: d is undefined`? the script is included. $('#element').rules() exists and is a function, it's just typeerroring on what should be a valid invocation
[12:09:53] <decx> the d is silent unless you reproduce it in a fiddle
[12:10:17] <robertmaxrees> usually that means you're trying to use something that requires the extras that aren't included by default.
[12:11:13] <Zeranoe> http://jsbin.com/qabawucare/1/ click on the first column input box on the last row and the table grows one row. I would like the last row to always grow the table, and not stick to the 2nd to last, and then 3rd to last, and so on. robertmaxrees
[12:12:15] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: I'm pretty sure it's because the selector is binding to the :last on the page load and not refreshing it after a new row is added
[12:12:25] <robertmaxrees> exactly :)
[12:12:42] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener and see if the current one is the last one.
[12:15:23] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: I'm not sure how to do that?
[12:16:04] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:16:53] <mathu> decx: if i could reproduce it i'm be very happy. alas, i cannot
[12:17:24] <mathu> decx: i'd*. in fact, i am running this code in two places. it works in one and not the other
[12:17:40] <mathu> decx: identical javascript, and /nearly/ identical html
[12:18:12] <daviorocha> hi, I have a list of images and when I mouse-enter the image is shows an icon on top, the class for all images have the same name, how can I select just one image ? I am tyring to find a solution, at the moment if I mouse-enter one image it shows on all (all classes have the same name).
[12:18:30] <robertmaxrees> mathu yeah sounds like you're not satisfying all the scrip[ts it nees.
[12:21:20] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe http://jsbin.com/zecudidexi/1/edit
[12:22:20] <notchris> robertmaxrees: If I append the data from the loaded page, can I make only one element visible
[12:22:29] <notchris> I just cant have everything else visible
[12:22:43] <notchris> If I remove everything but the one element I want, the script breaks
[12:22:48] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Excellent, you beat me too it but I was getting there. Slightly modified but the final: http://jsbin.com/ruqaxiyose/1/ what is the browser support for that?
[12:23:20] <robertmaxrees> notchris you'd have to do a lot of gross css work for that.
[12:23:31] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe not sure i follow.
[12:23:36] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Can I detach everything?
[12:23:39] <robertmaxrees> for which part?  the focus?
[12:23:42] <notchris> That makes it available still right?
[12:23:49] <robertmaxrees> not if they're using delegation.
[12:24:35] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: That whole script? Will it work in IE7?
[12:24:54] <robertmaxrees> ... yeah?
[12:24:58] <robertmaxrees> ewrr, maybe?
[12:25:05] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to check the focus event.
[12:25:11] <robertmaxrees> everything else should be kosher.
[12:30:54] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Youâ€™re right, this would require some nasty CSS
[12:31:00] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I wish there was a better way
[12:31:38] <robertmaxrees> have you contacted this company and asked them when they'd do?
[12:35:47] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Course it breaks when I integrate the example into the real thing...
[12:35:59] <robertmaxrees> that code makes some assumptions soooo.
[12:41:19] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: In the real thing, it adds one row on focus, but does not add another one if you select the last row, or the 2nd to last. Any idea where to look?
[12:45:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:49:51] <pauled> hi, I don't understand if I do this on console: if ($('div.finished')) { console.log('state #1') } else {console.log('state #2')}; it return 'state #1' but there are no div.finished.
[12:51:40] <robertmaxrees> because $() is always true.
[12:51:42] <robertmaxrees> you want .length
[12:51:58] <robertmaxrees> if ($('.finished').length)
[12:52:36] <Crucials> > 0?
[12:52:40] <robertmaxrees> just .length
[12:52:43] <robertmaxrees> 0 is falsy
[12:52:59] <Crucials> yeah but please
[12:53:01] <pauled> Ah sorry, got it. ^^
[12:53:03] <Crucials> its not false :(
[12:53:07] <robertmaxrees> sure it is.
[12:53:10] <robertmaxrees> 0 is falsy
[12:53:26] <robertmaxrees> 0, '', null, undefined, false, NaN.
[12:53:55] <Crucials> thats just too vague for me personally
[12:54:06] <robertmaxrees> really?
[12:54:14] <robertmaxrees> that's plenty explicit for me.
[12:54:35] <robertmaxrees> i tend to really dislight implicit code, but knowing the falsy values seems pretty self explanatory.
[12:55:30] <Crucials> yeah im kinda the opposite, i prefer it to be pretty explicit
[12:55:41] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:55:53] <robertmaxrees> i just said i tend to dislike implicit code
[12:56:08] <robertmaxrees> lol you can't say "i'm the opposite" if we aree on that :)
[12:56:15] <Crucials> there was a but so i took it to be falsy >:)
[12:56:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> i guess i just expect people to know their falsy values (shrug)
[12:57:35] <Crucials> how does the bot thing work, do I just put a >
[12:57:47] <Crucials> > false == 0
[12:57:55] <robertmaxrees> js> false == 0
[12:57:55] <Crucials> is that on a different channel
[12:57:57] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: No output.
[12:58:09] <robertmaxrees> js> console.log(false == 0);
[12:58:12] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: No output.
[12:58:19] <Crucials> js> print(false == 0);
[12:58:27] <b-ot> Crucials: true
[12:58:36] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:58:42] <Crucials> js> print(false == '');
[12:58:45] <b-ot> Crucials: true
[12:58:50] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy
[12:59:09] <Crucials> js> print(0 == '0');
[12:59:14] <b-ot> Crucials: true
[12:59:16] <robertmaxrees> one of the ONLY times i'm okay with using coercion
[12:59:29] <robertmaxrees> js> print('0' == false)
[12:59:33] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:59:38] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: true
[12:59:45] <Crucials> js> print('' == '0');
[12:59:47] <b-ot> Crucials: false
[13:00:08] <robertmaxrees> js> print('' == '0')
[13:00:15] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: false
[13:00:21] <Crucials> so false == 0, 0 == '0', but '' is not '0'?
[13:00:23] <robertmaxrees> js> print('0' == '')
[13:00:24] <Crucials> thats nuts to me
[13:00:31] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: false
[13:00:33] <robertmaxrees> and you're convoluting things.
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> again: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy
[13:00:52] <robertmaxrees> also: this is why you almost never use == over ===
[13:01:07] <Crucials> print(false === 0);
[13:01:09] <Crucials> ops
[13:01:11] <Crucials> but yeah
[13:09:32] <pauled> js>print(false === 0)
[13:09:40] <pauled> js> print(false === 0)
[13:09:49] <b-ot> pauled: false
[13:10:30] <robertmaxrees> because it's not the same thing.
[13:10:43] <robertmaxrees> but in a boolean context, it evaluates to false.
[13:11:19] <pauled> difficult for me to understand
[13:11:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cdb8jw5c/1/
[13:11:41] <robertmaxrees> "boolean context" is in cases like if statements.
[13:12:04] <robertmaxrees> 0, NaN, '' (empty string), null, undefined, and false are your falsy values.
[13:15:25] <pauled> js> if (!'0') { alert('lol'); }; console.log('0' == false);
[13:15:33] <b-ot> pauled: No output.
[13:15:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah... not going to work in here.
[13:16:00] <robertmaxrees> open your console in the fiddle.
[13:16:14] <pauled> the console output is 'true'
[13:16:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:16:30] <robertmaxrees> because using == isn't the same as an if statuement.
[13:16:34] <robertmaxrees> welcome to javascript and types.
[13:20:40] <Seedmanc> Does .ajax behaviour of jQuery differs between Chrome and Opera 12.17?
[13:21:36] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Still working on this issue... It's something with the if $(this) part... it doesn't seem to think that the selected input is the last of the table
[13:21:55] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have.
[13:23:27] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: It's kinda a bid program... Is there a way to see what $(this) actually thinks it is?
[13:23:33] <NoiseEee> Seedmanc: shouldn't
[13:25:10] <Seedmanc> I'm using ajax in my userscript for tumblr to request info about posts on page from Tumblr api. I'm indicating amount of images in every post by adding a number to document.title in every call of .done() for ajax call of a particular post.
[13:25:52] <fekz> How would you select the text Home in this case to add a class to the <li>? <li><a href="index.php">Home</a></li>
[13:26:05] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe console.log($(this))
[13:26:18] <Seedmanc> In Opera it works properly, meaning that order of image # numbers in title is the same as order of posts on page (and order of ajax calls). In Chrome order is different sometimes, I guess it's due to asynchronous calling, but I have same way of calling in Opera and it works.
[13:26:47] <Seedmanc> I tried setting async:false but it changed nothing.
[13:26:59] <robertmaxrees> that'll freeze your browser, too.
[13:27:26] <NoiseEee> Seedmanc: you can never depend on the 'ordering' of items in an object
[13:27:34] <robertmaxrees> only arrays are reliable for order.
[13:28:05] <Seedmanc> Object? I just get a list of posts on page via some selector and then run ajax calls over that array.
[13:28:13] <robertmaxrees> that's not an array.
[13:28:24] <robertmaxrees> that's an array-like object. how do you run calls against it?
[13:28:42] <robertmaxrees> and that doesn't guarantee when the ajax calls will finish fwiw.
[13:28:49] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: omfg, it's appending to another table lol. datepicker... good tip on the consolelog
[13:28:51] <Seedmanc> I realize that since calls are asynchronous, order of their completion does not depend on the order of calling, but then it shouldn't be working in Opera either.
[13:28:59] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe there you go :)
[13:29:07] <NoiseEee> Seedmanc: Opera and Chrome will iterate through objects differently
[13:29:13] <NoiseEee> Seedmanc: pastebin an xhr response
[13:29:21] <NoiseEee> Seedmanc: and/or the code you use to iterate over it
[13:29:21] <robertmaxrees> Seedmanc except that it's not guaranteed, so there's no guarantee what is/isn't broken in each browser.
[13:30:18] <Zeranoe> hey look, it works now lol
[13:30:29] <robertmaxrees> wooo!
[13:30:50] <Seedmanc> well that's difficult
[13:30:51] <pauled> fekz: perhaps indexOf()
[13:31:15] <robertmaxrees> fekz what do you meant "Selkect the text Home"?
[13:31:31] <robertmaxrees> you could see if $('li a').text() === 'Home'
[13:31:39] <robertmaxrees> or just $('li').text() in that case.
[13:31:54] <pauled> if('#divId').text().indexOf("this string/part of this string") != -1)
[13:32:07] <Seedmanc> By run against a list of posts I meant for every node in the list of $(',post') I find a post ID and then call Ajax with that ID in a loop. So the order of calls is same as order of posts, but order of responses is different in Chrome, but not in Opera.
[13:32:09] <robertmaxrees> should use !== in those cases.
[13:32:15] <fekz> I want to add a class to the <li> according to the text inside it
[13:32:19] <robertmaxrees> Seedmanc what code are you using for that?
[13:32:30] <fekz> but there's a <a> before the text
[13:32:34] <robertmaxrees> that's fine
[13:32:43] <robertmaxrees> $('li').text() will get you 'Home' in that case.
[13:32:46] <Seedmanc> I'll try to make a pastebin, but since it's a userscript that should be applied to a site it might be difficult.
[13:32:54] <robertmaxrees> just the code for the iterating.
[13:35:10] <pauled> perhaps? if (  $("li:contains('Home')" ).text() ) {
[13:35:32] <robertmaxrees> err...
[13:35:42] <NoiseEee> Seedmanc: just know that if you have a collection of objects, iterating through them will happen in no specific order / will def. be different between Opera and Chrome
[13:35:44] <robertmaxrees> if ($('li').text() === 'Home') {}
[13:36:04] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee yeah, and the ajax calls with finish in no guaranteed order, either.
[13:36:14] <NoiseEee> right
[13:36:32] <pauled> robertmaxrees: what about http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[13:37:01] <robertmaxrees> pauled you could use that, but it's a little slow and kind of cumbersome.
[13:37:15] <robertmaxrees> in that case, it'd be if (  $("li:contains('Home')" ).length ) {
[13:37:16] <pauled> I see thanks :)
[13:38:10] <_shaggy> hey how to make random movement animation in adiv by jquery ??
[13:38:14] <_shaggy> can ne1 help me ?
[13:38:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:38:35] <pauled> css3
[13:38:39] <_shaggy> like creating an ocean animation where fish fool around !!
[13:38:53] <robertmaxrees> is that the specific thing you want to do?
[13:39:07] <_shaggy> ne links or framework which could help  ?
[13:39:30] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:39:35] <_shaggy> yeaah i wonna create animation of ocean where fish fool around using jquery !!
[13:39:39] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of a broad creation.
[13:39:51] <_shaggy> but somthing cld be doen ?
[13:39:57] <robertmaxrees> *thing to want to do.  i am out of it today.  yeah.
[13:40:02] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn a lot of different things.
[13:40:12] <_shaggy> like ?
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> html.  css.  javascript.
[13:40:20] <_shaggy> give me a lead to start with  !!
[13:40:22] <robertmaxrees> jquery could help there.
[13:40:23] <_shaggy> if possible
[13:40:35] <fekz> pauled, robertmaxrees, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rVxBVr
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy i've heard good things about the courses on http://www.codecademy.com/
[13:40:59] <_shaggy> WTF i know little bit of all these things !!
[13:41:08] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy you need to learn more of each.
[13:41:13] <robertmaxrees> fekz http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NqxKGj
[13:41:20] <robertmaxrees> uppercase H
[13:41:45] <fekz> oh my god
[13:41:52] <_shaggy> Why me  ?
[13:41:52] <fekz> I'm so sorry lol
[13:42:04] <_shaggy> cant u js help me instead
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy because knowing them will tell you where to start.
[13:42:10] <_shaggy> if u know somthing ~~
[13:42:18] <pauled> fekz: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15833068/4070433
[13:42:26] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy i know a lot, but what you're asking for is kind of a broad question.
[13:42:40] <robertmaxrees> fekz - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NqxKGj
[13:42:41] <robertmaxrees> even better
[13:43:08] <_shaggy> seriously i wonna create a div where in many tags will have random motion !!
[13:43:20] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy great.  so start by building the basic parts of that.
[13:43:30] <Seedmanc> robertmaxrees: NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/muxs5SRL
[13:43:34] <fekz> robertmaxrees, pauled, thank you so much.
[13:43:39] <fekz> It's working now :]
[13:43:42] <fekz> <3
[13:43:56] <pauled> fekz: wait 1 min
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> Seedmanc yeah, your issue here is that there's no guarantee on the order of things completing.
[13:44:12] <fekz> pauled, sure
[13:44:21] <robertmaxrees> it'll be inconsistent.  some browsers might end up being similar while others won't be,
[13:44:27] <Seedmanc> Yet there never was a problem in Opera and I've been testing it for a long time.
[13:44:36] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything fwiw.
[13:44:44] <robertmaxrees> that what "there's no guarantee" means.
[13:44:47] <Seedmanc> Should setting async=false fix it at least in theory or it's a different issue?
[13:44:50] <robertmaxrees> also, jQuery.each(posts, function(i,v){   isn't the right thin to use in this case.
[13:45:05] <robertmaxrees> posts.each(function(i,v){  is what you should usem, but that won't fix your problem.
[13:45:08] <robertmaxrees> you need promises.
[13:45:09] <NoiseEee> async=false is never a solution
[13:45:27] <Seedmanc> I mean if it would have fixed it maybe Opera force enable sync mode somehow.
[13:45:39] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> opera just handles to finish things in the "correct" order.
[13:46:38] <Seedmanc> Well I wish I could make the 'superior' chrome do that as well.
[13:46:38] <NoiseEee> today is async day :)
[13:47:01] <robertmaxrees> Seedmanc no, you just need to build up an object of responses that you handle in the order you want.
[13:47:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to remember the article i read about using promises for exactly this kind of scenario.
[13:47:28] <Seedmanc> You mean reorder the responses? But that would require waiting till the last one finishes.
[13:47:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:47:41] <robertmaxrees> not with promises - that's exactly what this tutorial explained :)
[13:47:48] <pauled> fekz: this should work http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gpPYPM
[13:48:03] <robertmaxrees> pauled no need for .each() there.
[13:48:09] <robertmaxrees> use .filter()instead.
[13:48:33] <Seedmanc> I don't get it. Is there a tutorial to make Chrome behave?
[13:48:39] <NoiseEee> its not about chrome
[13:48:42] <robertmaxrees> Seedmanc this is not about chromne.
[13:48:43] <robertmaxrees> at all.
[13:48:47] <robertmaxrees> get that idea out of your head.
[13:48:53] <pauled> robertmaxrees: hmmm if better than mine, I will update my usserscript then :)
[13:48:57] <robertmaxrees> just because opera does it one way is irrelevant.
[13:49:03] <Seedmanc> Porting my userJS from Opera to Chrome is such a pain, everything that worked previously in the most logica way is just messed up there.
[13:49:07] <robertmaxrees> Seedmanc http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/ - this is what you need to do.
[13:49:16] <NoiseEee> and tomorrows Opera might very well change its iteration order
[13:49:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:49:22] <Seedmanc> Opera does it the right way without tinkering.
[13:49:40] <Seedmanc> Opera won't change it's stuck in 12.17
[13:49:45] <robertmaxrees> your issue has everythiung to do with network requests and how they work.
[13:49:49] <NoiseEee> Seedmanc: you need to step away from the computer for a bit :)  it has nothing to do with the browser
[13:49:58] <Seedmanc> there will never be an update ;_;
[13:50:08] <robertmaxrees> opera moved to the same rendering engine as chrome fwiw.
[13:50:13] <robertmaxrees> different js engine though i think.
[13:50:14] <Seedmanc> I'm judging from what I see.
[13:50:21] <robertmaxrees> but this isn't about what you think it is.
[13:50:31] <robertmaxrees> read that tutorial and you'll see where the issue lies.
[13:50:57] <Seedmanc> Presto can, webkit can't and that bothers me.
[13:51:05] <Seedmanc> Well I hope it'll help.
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a webkit issue either fwiw.
[13:52:00] <NoiseEee> Seedmanc: embrace javascript and all its async goodness
[13:52:10] <NoiseEee> understand how to use promises and/or callbacks to achieve what you want
[13:52:16] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.  it's one of the new non-warts of the language.
[13:52:52] <Seedmanc> Well I certainly wouldn't want to wait till all posts are processed, better update the title as the process is going on so yes async is good.
[13:53:10] <robertmaxrees> that's what that article i linked shows you how to handle.
[13:53:29] <Seedmanc> Will I be able to do that in a loop?
[13:53:31] <robertmaxrees> in fact, the example it plows through is almost the exact same thing you're working on.
[13:53:41] <robertmaxrees> ... read the tutorial i linked you.
[13:54:53] <notchris> Hey robertmaxrees, if I have a link with an inlined onClick
[13:54:56] <notchris> something like
[13:55:05] <notchris> onClick=â€œfoo();â€
[13:55:20] <notchris> How can I make function foo get the alt attr of that link
[13:55:24] <notchris> I know how to use .attr
[13:55:29] <notchris> But I tried $(this)
[13:55:30] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:55:38] <notchris> But Iâ€™m assuming $(this) does not reference the link?
[13:55:38] <robertmaxrees> why is it inlined?
[13:55:54] <lloople> anyone can explain me why this is selecting the checkboxes inside the div with id=admin-forms??
[13:55:54] <lloople> $('div').not('[id="admin-forms"]').find('input[type=checkbox]')
[13:55:58] <lloople> I'm getting mad
[13:56:22] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/0cyRNaX4
[13:56:30] <pauled> fekz: I corrected with .filter() http://fiddle.jshell.net/1uq2os2k/1/
[13:56:44] <robertmaxrees> lloople is there a parent div to the one you don't want?
[13:56:56] <lloople> sometimes yes
[13:57:01] <robertmaxrees> that would do it.
[13:57:06] <lloople> oh...
[13:57:08] <lloople> I got you
[13:57:12] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:57:41] <lloople> well, I'll solve with conditional inside then, more easy
[13:57:48] <robertmaxrees> nah, there's  asimpler way.
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> use .filter()
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> $('input[type=checkbox]').filter(function() { return $(this).parents('#admin-forms').length === 0 });
[13:58:35] <lloople> parents will search in all parents?
[13:58:45] <robertmaxrees> ?api parents
[13:58:46] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .parents(): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[13:58:59] <lloople> omg
[13:59:08] <lloople> three years developing without knowing this
[13:59:15] <robertmaxrees> use it sparingly fwiw.
[13:59:23] <robertmaxrees> .closest() is similar but stops once it finds a match.
[13:59:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd actually use .closest() there in fact.
[13:59:37] <lloople> thousand of times I did $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent()....
[13:59:46] <robertmaxrees> use .closest() instead though.
[14:00:06] <lloople> thanks wiki-robert :)
[14:01:03] <pauled> RoberPediaUniversalis :)
[14:01:24] <lloople> hahaha
[14:01:41] <lloople> omfg that crazy hack is working loving you guys
[14:01:58] <lloople> never seen a code like this, feel like a hacker
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> that's not a hack.
[14:02:00] <lloople> $('input[type=checkbox]').filter(function() {
[14:02:00] <lloople>     return $(this).closest('#admin-forms').length === 0;
[14:02:00] <lloople> }).each(function () {
[14:02:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah don't paste into the channel btw.
[14:02:18] <robertmaxrees> and something tells me you don't want .each() after that, but ok.
[14:02:35] <lloople> I need to transform every checkbox with a plugin
[14:02:44] <lloople> http://fronteed.com/iCheck/
[14:02:52] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:03:40] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you could just do .iCheck() after that filter.
[14:04:00] <lloople> yeah but I need to remove first the label, wait I'll make a pastebin
[14:04:05] <_shaggy_> robertmaxrees help me too :P
[14:04:18] <robertmaxrees> whatcha need duder?
[14:04:24] <robertmaxrees> do you have aspecific question?
[14:04:31] <lloople> robertmaxrees, http://pastebin.com/njs3LjPP
[14:04:52] <robertmaxrees> ah.  fair enough.

[14:07:14] <pauled> _shaggy_: animation with jquery? do it with css3 html5
[14:07:29] <robertmaxrees> he's trying to do random fish movements.
[14:07:32] <_shaggy_> Hmmm  see basically jquery.simplyscroll.js moves text like a marquee can some one js change the positions of inner div of a div in random manner such that i looks like a motion !
[14:07:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:08:29] <robertmaxrees> what you're asking is possible.
[14:08:53] <_shaggy_> u have a container div and it has lots of child divs can js some one change the position of all its child !!
[14:08:59] <pauled> _shaggy_: fish aquarium https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/fish-animation-using-css3/launch
[14:09:03] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy_ sure.
[14:09:04] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[14:09:14] <robertmaxrees> hah, there you go.
[14:10:00] <_shaggy_> its doen through jquery !! seriously if yes then thanksss ! :P
[14:10:15] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy_ check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/fish-animation-using-css3/launch
[14:10:23] <robertmaxrees> pauled had a good find.
[14:10:39] <pauled> remove launch in url to get info
[14:15:09] <pauled> _shaggy_ robertmaxrees : found a better one: http://cssdeck.com/labs/pure-css3-animated-fish-tank
[14:15:33] <robertmaxrees> holy shit.
[14:15:35] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of css.
[14:16:26] <pauled> lol yeah

[14:16:53] <pauled> I didn't saw that tiny scrollbar
[14:17:06] <robertmaxrees> 3k+ lines
[14:17:22] <pauled> yeah crazy
[14:17:39] <pauled> but the result is nice
[14:36:05] <cool_boy> I am trying " self.$('#discount-card-select').html(content + new_option);" to set html , it doesn't set but I can see value of "content+ new_options " on console is printed <option value=""></option><option value="1:20:fi">Fixed 20 %</option>
[14:36:20] <cool_boy> any idea what could be wrong ?
[14:37:06] <robertmaxrees>  self.$('#discount-card-select') isn't a thing.
[14:37:13] <robertmaxrees> just do $('#discount-card-select').html(content + new_option);
[14:38:03] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: doesn't change anything
[14:38:49] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="discount-card-select"]').length);
[14:38:51] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[14:38:57] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: probably it is something in backbone.js because it was working like that in same method I wrote with promise
[14:39:35] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: 0
[14:39:42] <robertmaxrees> there's your problem.
[14:39:49] <robertmaxrees> there is no element with that ID.
[14:42:09] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: yes there is <select id="discount-card-select"></select>
[14:42:14] <cool_boy> it just doesn't have options
[14:42:18] <cool_boy> that I am trying to set
[14:42:32] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('#discount-card-select').length);
[14:42:34] <robertmaxrees> try that
[14:43:18] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: 1
[14:43:53] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up.  if the first returned "0" but the second returned 1, you have something broken.
[14:47:34] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: I placed an if       .....  if ($('#discount-card-select').length > 0) {} inside that both are printing to 1
[14:47:54] <robertmaxrees> btw you can just do  if ($('#discount-card-select').length) {}
[14:47:58] <robertmaxrees> no need for a > 0
[14:48:14] <cool_boy> cool
[14:48:17] <robertmaxrees> and that's really weird.  either way. $('#discount-card-select').html(content + new_option); should work.
[14:48:18] <cool_boy> thanks for the tip
[14:51:19] <cool_boy> ]:s
[14:51:21] <cool_boy> :S
[14:51:59] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[14:52:20] <cool_boy> no error
[14:52:36] <robertmaxrees> no clue then without seeing an example
[14:52:42] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: I tried $('#discount-card-select').html('<option value=""></option><option value="1:20:fi">Fixed 20 %</option>');
[14:52:51] <cool_boy> still didn't showup
[14:52:59] <robertmaxrees> then the element doesn't exist when you make that call.
[14:55:42] <cool_boy> that might be case
[14:55:44] <robertmaxrees> just out of curiosity, how do you make that element?
[14:55:45] <cool_boy> :(
[14:59:55] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: I am not much clear with the process to explain, I but I will try I create <span class="placeholder-PaymentScreenDiscountWidget" />  tag, then I write render method  using backbone.js libarary, In that method I compute and create <options> then I used replace($('.placeholder-PaymentScreenDiscountWidget')
[15:00:09] <cool_boy> infact this.discount_card_widget.replace($('.placeholder-PaymentScreenDiscountWidget'));
[15:00:10] <robertmaxrees> ... don't explain.  make a fiddle.
[15:00:19] <robertmaxrees> a simplified one.
[15:00:33] <cool_boy> I tried didn't find backbone.js there
[15:00:47] <cool_boy> if that exists there?
[15:01:03] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/LbIIzLn.png
[15:01:13] <pauled> you can fill an external js
[15:04:41] <pauled> I have to go. Good evening everyone.
[15:04:47] <pauled> Take care of robertmaxrees \_/
[15:04:50] <pauled> :)
[15:04:53] <pauled> bye
[15:05:19] <cool_boy> good evening pauled
[15:05:31] <cool_boy> dnt even know external url
[15:05:34] <cool_boy> :(
[15:05:44] <robertmaxrees> you link in the js files there.
[15:06:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ugxp051w/ like this
[15:06:51] <Crucials> when you have a jsfiddle account you know things are serious
[15:07:08] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:19:25] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: sorry, difficult to make fiddle  I am following https://github.com/yelizariev/pos-addons/blob/8.0/tg_pos_enhanced/static/src/js/tg_pos.js#L2239 code
[15:20:09] <robertmaxrees> this.formclient needs to be appended to the document first.
[15:20:15] <robertmaxrees> then you can select it and manipulate it.
[15:20:51] <aceus> hey, im using jquery and have an issue with javascript
[15:20:59] <aceus> i have one index.html file, and when pushing a button to change view to a new div the javascript wont load until i refresh the page
[15:21:03] <aceus> any ideas?
[15:21:10] <robertmaxrees> show us your javascript.
[15:21:19] <aceus> sure! hold on
[15:21:28] <aceus> can i pastebin the complete index.html ?
[15:21:33] <robertmaxrees> i guess?
[15:24:05] <aceus> source: <!DOCTYPE html>
[15:24:05] <aceus> <html>
[15:24:05] <aceus> <head>
[15:24:05] <aceus> 	<meta charset="utf-8" />
[15:24:05] <aceus> 	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no,
[15:24:19] <robertmaxrees> woah not here.
[15:24:20] <aceus> uh sry
[15:24:29] <aceus> http://pastebin.com/gnAW8nLN
[15:24:52] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[15:24:53] <aceus> got fooled by my ctrl-c
[15:24:54] <robertmaxrees> where's the JS?
[15:25:13] <aceus> line 98 to 105
[15:25:32] <robertmaxrees> that code doesn't re-run?
[15:25:33] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[15:25:45] <aceus> so when changing page to <div data-role="page" id="p1"> that javascript code has to be refreshed manually
[15:25:48] <aceus> otherwise it wont show
[15:25:57] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:26:07] <robertmaxrees> link that externally and call it manually instead.
[15:26:18] <aceus> hm
[15:26:32] <aceus> by putting the code in an external file.js ?
[15:26:52] <aceus> line 99-105 ?
[15:26:56] <robertmaxrees> wrap it in a function, link it normally (as in, not within that div), and then call the function when you need to.
[15:28:24] <aceus> hm, not getting it really. quite new to this... should i put the function between <script> tags in <head> ?
[15:28:29] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:28:52] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:28:58] <aceus> link it normally = in the bottom as the other .js file imports?
[15:29:01] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:29:05] <aceus> no problem
[15:29:18] <robertmaxrees> move <script src="img-touch-canvas.js"></script> do where the other js files are.
[15:29:24] <aceus> yes
[15:29:46] <robertmaxrees> make another new file called whatever you want and link that.
[15:30:05] <aceus> cool, i'll try it
[15:30:12] <robertmaxrees> that's not all.
[15:30:13] <aceus> at the bottom
[15:30:15] <aceus> ?
[15:30:40] <robertmaxrees> yes.  in that, put this code: http://fixee.org/paste/gtxocg1/
[15:30:54] <robertmaxrees> then just call makeNewGesturableImg() any time you want it to run.
[15:31:04] <robertmaxrees> that's a hack but it'll get you started.
[15:33:29] <aceus> hm
[15:33:58] <aceus> <script>makeNewGesturableImg();</script> in the div?
[15:34:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:34:10] <robertmaxrees> how are you showing new content?
[15:34:45] <aceus> with this? <a href="#p1" data-role="button" data-icon="location">Map</a>
[15:35:08] <robertmaxrees> there should be some kind of callback that lets you run js after the new page has loaded.
[15:35:20] <aceus> ah alright, did not know
[15:35:35] <aceus> like a javascript.onload method?
[15:35:40] <aceus> pageload?
[15:35:55] <robertmaxrees> within whgatever framework/library you're using to manage the pageloads.
[15:36:15] <aceus> $(document).on("pageinit",function(){});?
[15:36:30] <aceus> i'm just using jquery mobile with some cordova import
[15:36:31] <robertmaxrees> does pageinit get fired for each new pageload?
[15:36:52] <aceus> don't know actually. probably only when it has been initialized
[15:37:11] <robertmaxrees> (you're going to have to read some documentation ;) )
[15:37:15] <aceus> true that
[15:37:25] <aceus> is there any built in call back method in jquery mobile?
[15:37:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:37:38] <robertmaxrees> dunno - read their documentation.
[15:37:39] <aceus> haha
[15:39:17] <aceus> any link or google keywords of where to start? :)
[15:39:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jquerymobile.com/
[15:40:14] <aceus> :)
[15:40:19] <aceus> true
[15:42:30] <aceus> what do you think about $( ".selector" ).pagecontainer({}); ? :)
[15:42:38] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[15:42:55] <aceus> if it's a good choice
[15:43:04] <aceus> hehe
[15:43:07] <_shaggy> hey how to capture onclick event of somthing drawn in canvas ?
[15:43:12] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery mobile run code after page load

[15:44:47] <_shaggy> robertmaxrees my savior how to capture onclick event of somthing drawn in HTML5 Canvas
[15:44:56] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy i just showed you.
[15:45:04] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery onclick canvas @ _shaggy
[15:45:04] <b-ot> _shaggy: HTML5 canvas click event - Stack Overflow â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3067691/html5-canvas-click-event
[15:48:58] <aceus> this is probably a better idea to use: $( document ).delegate("#p1", "pagecreate", function() {}); ?
[15:49:08] <robertmaxrees> .on()
[15:49:14] <_shaggy> hey can i draw a div inside a canvas ??
[15:49:18] <robertmaxrees> .on('pagecreate', {});
[15:49:26] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy tryu searching google.
[15:49:28] <aceus> alright
[15:49:34] <_shaggy> hopefully it make sense
[15:49:51] <robertmaxrees> aceus you shouldn't need the element in there.
[15:49:53] <aceus> sorry for all the questions, but should I put that code within the div?
[15:49:59] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:50:04] <aceus> in the bottom?
[15:50:07] <robertmaxrees> in the external script you created.
[15:50:13] <aceus> oh okey
[15:50:20] <robertmaxrees> the answer is NEVER put it in the div.
[15:50:26] <aceus> ok great
[15:50:54] <aceus> and i wrap all the other code within that function?
[15:51:07] <robertmaxrees> aceus which functionm?
[15:51:11] <aceus> uh sry
[15:51:19] <robertmaxrees> you really need to do a js basics it looks like.
[15:51:25] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're just copy/pasting things.
[15:51:35] <aceus> i just call the other function that you made, from this pagecreate function
[15:51:39] <aceus> no
[15:51:46] <robertmaxrees> share the fixee.
[15:51:52] <aceus> im a java developer in the bottom
[15:51:54] <aceus> really new to this
[15:51:56] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[15:52:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you should do a js basics tutorial then.  fundamentally diofferent from java
[15:52:38] <aceus> yep. i've done some code academy
[15:53:00] <robertmaxrees> because it should be really apparent what to do.  bind a single listener - don't run it more than once.
[15:53:45] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('pageinit', functoon() { // code to run when a new page inits });
[15:55:14] <aceus> like this? http://pastebin.com/EPAhweSh
[15:55:44] <robertmaxrees> or just $(document).on('pageinit', makeNewGesturableImg);
[15:57:03] <aceus> hm
[15:57:10] <aceus> it do not work, strange...
[15:57:16] <aceus> just a grey box, no img
[15:57:21] <aceus> even when refreshing
[15:57:29] <robertmaxrees> hard to help without a fiddle at this point.
[15:57:30] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[15:58:00] <aceus> alright
[16:01:35] <shudon> hi all :) what is the second argument to jQuery()?
[16:02:35] <robertmaxrees> shudon example?
[16:02:42] <shudon> $(selector, context)
[16:02:55] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with .find() ?
[16:03:28] <shudon> i believe so. i mean, i use it. maybe i don't know everything it does, though.
[16:03:50] <robertmaxrees> it's basically that under the hood - $('child', 'parent') maps to $('parent').find('child');
[16:06:15] <shudon> ah thanks robertmaxrees
[16:12:29] <aceus> even $( document ).delegate("#p1", "pagecreate", function() {alert('A')}); is not working...
[16:12:43] <robertmaxrees> .delegate is deprecated fwiw.
[16:12:55] <aceus> okey
[16:12:57] <robertmaxrees> and #p1 would be the element that the event came from, which it wouldn't in this case afaik.
[16:13:11] <aceus> oh alright
[16:13:27] <aceus> the id of the button ?
[16:13:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't think pagecreate comes from a button.
[16:14:46] <robertmaxrees> put a console.log() in the code you have now - do you see that?
[16:15:48] <robertmaxrees> something like $(document).on('pageinit', function(event) { console.log('hi') });
[16:15:49] <robertmaxrees> does that work?
[16:17:03] <aceus> http://pastebin.com/ZsyNwJLZ is not logging anything
[16:17:14] <aceus> i can try your code as well
[16:17:35] <robertmaxrees> something is up then.
[16:17:39] <robertmaxrees> no console errors at all?
[16:17:39] <aceus> hm
[16:19:05] <aceus> nop, and these are at the bottom <script src="img-touch-canvas.js"></script><script src="canvas_map.js"></script>
[16:19:15] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.
[16:19:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see a fuddle.
[16:19:21] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[16:19:28] <aceus> yep, understand
[16:19:32] <robertmaxrees> are you sure your code is even loading?
[16:19:56] <aceus> if doing alert at the bottom within a <script> tag, it pops up
[16:20:11] <robertmaxrees> in one of the new scrips you made.
[16:20:20] <aceus> no
[16:20:31] <robertmaxrees> then they aren't even loading...
[16:20:41] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab.  see if they're 404ing.
[16:20:43] <aceus> hm
[16:21:01] <aceus> i'll try getting it running in chrome
[16:21:03] <aceus> using evothings atm
[16:22:39] <aceus> log says: LOG: [object Object] LOG: null
[16:22:47] <robertmaxrees> what does?
[16:24:01] <aceus> nvm, a scraping script
[16:24:26] <_shaggy> say  you are displaying meteor shower and you are showing its animation using canvas and continously changing  its x and y cordinate, so how is it possible taht which meteor was clicked using canvas's onclick eventhandler ? wat to do in that case
[16:24:28] <_shaggy> robertmaxrees dont be mad at me for asking a lot of possibly senseless questions !!
[16:24:44] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy did you try google first?
[16:24:55] <_shaggy> yeahh !!
[16:24:56] <aceus> <script>console.log('TEST')</script> at the bottom is working...
[16:24:57] <_shaggy> for sure !
[16:25:06] <robertmaxrees> aceus that's not what i care about.
[16:25:15] <robertmaxrees> i mean within the externally linked files outside of any functions.
[16:25:25] <aceus> hold on
[16:25:30] <robertmaxrees> _shaggy http://stackoverflow.com/a/9880302/923919
[16:25:51] <aceus> nope
[16:25:56] <aceus> don't seem to log anything
[16:25:57] <robertmaxrees> aceus that's your problem.
[16:25:59] <aceus> reeally strange
[16:26:01] <robertmaxrees> the files arne't loading.
[16:26:20] <aceus> omg
[16:26:22] <aceus> typo
[16:26:24] <aceus> here
[16:26:25] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:26:27] <aceus> ://
[16:26:56] <aceus> LOG: [ERR] ReferenceError: Can't find variable: $ [map_canvas.js: 2]
[16:27:11] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you've got another problem now.
[16:27:13] <aceus> 1
[16:27:17] <aceus> yep
[16:27:28] <aceus> this row:$(document).on('pageinit', makeNewGesturableImg);
[16:27:53] <robertmaxrees> that could mean the function is busted, too.
[16:28:54] <aceus> window.makeNewGesturableImg = function() ?
[16:29:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  i'd comment the body of that out and see if it goes away.
[16:29:53] <_shaggy> robertmaxrees but at every second i am redrawing every elemt so how would i keep proper track of position of elements in canvas !
[16:30:39] <aceus> no, same error
[16:33:45] <aceus> fixed it... new one [ERR] ReferenceError: Can't find variable: makeNewGesturableImg [map_canvas.js: 1]
[16:34:05] <aceus> uh hold on
[16:34:29] <aceus> no errors now
[16:34:58] <aceus> hm
[16:35:59] <aceus> but $(document).on('pageinit', makeNewGesturableImg); is never called
[16:36:03] <aceus> no console.log from there
[16:37:49] <aceus> does the import order of .js docs matteR?
[16:37:51] <aceus> i guess it does
[16:38:51] <aceus> external file atm with no errors, but no console log either: http://pastebin.com/LKXmj3KY
[16:41:53] <aceus> https://api.jquerymobile.com/pageinit/ deprecated?
[16:45:33] <aceus> makeNewGesturableImg is called now on pageinit, but pageinit only seems to be called once when app is starting, not when changing page
[17:03:50] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was away aceus
[17:03:54] <robertmaxrees> yes, order matters.
[17:05:31] <aceus> no problem
[17:05:47] <aceus> i've tried an example on fiddle now where pageinit works
[17:06:01] <aceus> but it does not trigger with my code, really strange
[17:08:00] <aceus> this is called each time the app is started $(document).on('pageinit', '#p5', makeNewGesturableImg()); even though p5 does not exist
[17:08:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:09:51] <aceus> uh
[17:10:34] <aceus> it's just because i put the makeNewGesturableImg() method ABOVE $(document).on('pageinit', '#p5', makeNewGesturableImg()); ... stupid me
[17:10:49] <robertmaxrees> or, that's not how ypou do that.
[17:10:50] <robertmaxrees>  $(document).on('pageinit', '#p5', makeNewGesturableImg);
[17:10:52] <robertmaxrees> no parens.
[17:11:06] <aceus> it gave me error without parens
[17:11:09] <robertmaxrees> you want the function object.
[17:11:11] <robertmaxrees> not the function call.
[17:11:18] <robertmaxrees> then you have another issue.
[17:11:23] <aceus> okey
[17:11:36] <robertmaxrees> the parens runs it once on pageload and then the returned value is waht's bound.
[17:12:10] <aceus> LOG: [ERR] ReferenceError: Can't find variable: makeNewGesturableImg [map_canvas.js: 1]
[17:12:29] <aceus> makeNewGesturableImg is underneath
[17:12:30] <robertmaxrees> put the function definition above the document binbding call.
[17:12:47] <robertmaxrees> that shoudln't matter but your environment might be weird.
[17:15:35] <aceus> $(document).on('pageinit', '#p1', function(){ console.log('P1');}) is not triggered either
[17:15:41] <aceus> i guess i have to give up
[17:15:47] <robertmaxrees> get rid of #p1
[17:15:53] <robertmaxrees> i explained this earlier.
[17:15:58] <robertmaxrees> you don't want a delegated listener.
[17:16:20] <aceus> ok
[17:16:23] <aceus> $(document).on('pageinit', function(){ console.log('P1');}); did not work =/
[17:16:32] <aceus> i followed this example: http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Q3Usv/
[17:17:02] <robertmaxrees> fwiw http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Q3Usv/551/
[17:17:12] <robertmaxrees> the events will bubble up anyway and get caught.
[17:18:59] <aceus> true
[17:19:17] <cool_boy> can we use .then() with if?
[17:19:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:19:25] <cool_boy> :P
[17:19:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm not joking - that sentence doesn't make sense.
[17:19:43] <cool_boy> I know
[17:19:45] <cool_boy> :)
[17:19:56] <aceus> oooh
[17:19:57] <cool_boy> I thought might make
[17:20:02] <aceus> removed <script src="lib/jquery.js"></script> import
[17:20:15] <aceus> now it triggers
[17:20:17] <robertmaxrees> aceus were you pulling in jquery twice?
[17:20:22] <aceus> uh
[17:20:24] <aceus> seems so
[17:20:25] <aceus> dafuq
[17:20:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:20:33] <robertmaxrees> that'll cause all kinds of problems.
[17:22:25] <aceus> lol
[17:22:32] <aceus> now p1 triggers as it should
[17:22:39] <aceus> although the map wont show up
[17:22:40] <aceus> :)
[17:22:44] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:25:59] <aceus> omg
[17:26:03] <aceus> robertmaxrees
[17:26:09] <aceus> everything works now!!
[17:26:53] <aceus> I can not describe how grateful i am :)
[17:27:09] <aceus> thanks soo much for your support!
[17:27:35] <aceus> I have to go to sleep now, it's really late over here in sweden
[17:27:52] <aceus> Thanks again, veery appreciated! ;)
[17:38:58] <craftbynick> decx: Hi, I wanted to mention again thanks a lot for your help I figured out a solution to this for your reference I have uploaded it to a git repo and you can assess it here https://bitbucket.org/nickloyal/tagging/src your help is much appreciated :)
[18:22:57] <daniel_sock> I am writing my first complex jquery script. Should i be nesting all these functions within one another? http://jsfiddle.net/mz1f5x08/11/
[18:28:07] <daniel_sock> Is anyone active on here?
[19:18:36] <jqueryius> hi
[19:18:44] <jqueryius> quick question about promises
[19:18:49] <jqueryius> is there a way to keep a counter?
[19:19:01] <jqueryius> of how many things to fulfil there are?
[19:19:31] <rcyr> What would be a use-case for that?
[19:20:06] <jqueryius> rcyr: I am selecting items from a database and want to know the total
[19:20:10] <jqueryius> See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/30076385/2884981
[19:21:35] <rcyr> I'm really familiar with promises but I don't get your question, sorry.
[19:21:59] <jqueryius> Okay, well in essense I use this to select all from a database: myDatabase.allDocs({include_docs: true}).then(function(result) {
[19:22:10] <jqueryius> Originally I used this to get the total records:  totalTasks = result.total_rows;
[19:22:25] <jqueryius> But in the answer to that question, see how he uses promises instead?
[19:22:37] <jqueryius> Given promises are being used, how can I find out the total rows?
[19:22:44] <jqueryius> I figured maybe a counter of some kind?
[20:04:30] <uskerine> how can you say:  $("input,select,textarea")   but only those belonging to #addUserForm
[20:07:13] <xaxxon> how do I force a scrolling div to scroll to the very bottom?
[20:07:41] <xaxxon> like.. show the bottommost content in a div
[20:08:07] <xaxxon> also, how do you get the "content height" of the stuff inside the div?
[20:08:29] <xaxxon> ok, I think the answer to both my questions is scrollheight
[22:31:10] <phpius> rcyr are you still around?
[23:33:19] <phpius> can anyone here spare a few minutes to answer a Promise related question?
[23:33:41] <Cork> ?ask
[23:34:00] <phpius> See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/30076385/2884981
[23:34:05] <Cork> <_<
[23:34:08] <phpius> This line:   return PouchDB.utils.Promise.all(docs.map(function (doc) {     return myDatabase.remove(doc);
[23:34:10] * Cork pokes b-ot
[23:34:23] <phpius> how can I have something happen AFTER the remove?
[23:34:52] <phpius> so like, when the final remove() happens - display a message for example
[23:35:08] <phpius> what I'm trying to do is display a progress bar, but that's not really important
[23:35:17] <phpius> I just want to know how to get it to happen after the remove()
[23:36:03] <phpius> I'm sorry, I shouldn't have linked to the stackoverflow article first because I think I scared you off :(
[23:40:21] <Uhkis> Cork: b-ot has become lazy
[23:40:30] <Uhkis> b-ot: are you lazy?
[23:40:30] <b-ot> Uhkis: as I see it, yes.
[23:40:31] <Cork> ya i see that
[23:48:35] <tx> Hey guys, I'm reading in an XML file from ajax to an array, (iterating over the each item in the xml file)
[23:49:18] <tx> how can I make it so my stored array can be referenced like (for each product) alert(product["id"]) instead of alert(product[0])
[23:49:44] <tx> (assuming products contains a list of product)
[23:50:09] <Cork> tx: make an object and not an array
[23:50:35] <Cork> var product = {}; product['id'] = id;
[23:50:43] <tx> Ahh, curly braces.
[23:50:51] <tx> Just swap them out and she'll be right?
[23:51:01] <Cork> no
[23:51:05] <Cork> array uses .push
[23:51:10] <Cork> objects don't
[23:51:20] <Cork> var arr = []; arr.push(newValue);
[23:51:41] <Cork> var obj = {}; obj['key'] = newValue (or obj.key = newValue;)
[23:58:11] <tx> Cork:  sweet, cheers mate.
