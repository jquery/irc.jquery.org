[00:01:19] <jbermudes> Is it normal for $('#foo').prop('disabled', false') on an element that was previously disabled to make firebug show that element as having disabled="" ?
[00:01:29] <danmichel> I can't seem to get .flex-title and .flex-caption to show up. thanks in advance for any help http://jsfiddle.net/CvDQ4/10/
[00:01:39] <shashi_> Hi cork there is no other way so that scrollTop for select list can work in msie
[00:07:32] <danmichel> When I remove the width from .flex-caption-container and .flex-title-container, the text in them are aligned to the left. what i want it to align them centered live: http://theplural.com/flextest/some.html    JS fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/CvDQ4/10/
[00:07:57] <MrMister> Supervan, are you talking about tidying up formatting?
[00:19:34] <MrMister> Cork, do I need to pass the even map before the sub-selector in .on()?
[00:20:43] <MrMister> $('#foo').on({"click": function(){}},".my-select-em")?
[00:21:49] <NodeX> on('click','SELECTOR',function......
[00:22:26] <MrMister> NodeX, but how do I send a map of events?
[00:22:53] <NodeX> a map?
[00:23:00] <NodeX> do you mean many events?
[00:23:30] <MrMister> if I don't delegate, I can use an object of {"click": function(){click stuff}, "change": function(){change stuff}}
[00:23:38] <MrMister> yes, am I using the  wrong terminology?
[00:23:47] <NodeX> "click change focus"
[00:23:52] <NodeX> just space separate
[00:25:25] <MrMister> I don't understand, but thanks. I'm looking for an example now. I understand sending many events, but not handling each with different funcitons
[00:26:18] <NodeX> you can work out the type with event.type iirc
[00:26:43] <NodeX> on('click','.foo',function(event) { .. if(event.type=='click') { ...
[00:27:08] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/event.type/
[00:27:54] <MiracleBlue> I wish I was good at design.
[00:28:07] <MiracleBlue> Or even just motivated to design something.
[00:28:31] <MrMister> ok, and that is only necessary for delegating with .on, othewise I can simply .on("event", "sub-selector", function)
[00:28:45] <macinchik> well that's half the battle
[00:28:46] <MrMister> MiracleBlue, redesign a site that you frequent
[00:29:57] <MiracleBlue> MrMister: Heh, that might be an idea...
[00:30:22] <MiracleBlue> I've been working on a web application for about a year now that is my big pet project.  It desperately needs a decent UI.
[00:30:44] <MiracleBlue> I'm just so under-motivated to actually get the UI side of things done.
[00:31:32] <MrMister> then just clone a UI you like, or throw bootstrap or jquery-ui bootstrap at it
[00:31:56] <MiracleBlue> Mmm.  Actually, bootstrap sounds like a good idea.
[00:32:32] <MiracleBlue> But that's only going to solve half the UI that it needs.  This is an audio application, needing knobs and visualisers of all sorts.
[00:32:51] <MiracleBlue> Guess I could find most of those sorts of bits and pieces around the place if I looked hard enough :)
[00:34:33] <MiracleBlue> Guess I'll figure something out :)
[00:39:47] <MrMister> well, think of it this way, you can simply use sliders for now
[00:39:54] <MrMister> and change to a knob later
[00:40:30] <MrMister> after all, both are "pots", only one slides and one rotates
[00:40:43] <MiracleBlue> Yeah, that's very true.
[00:41:13] <MrMister> better to get some UI set up before getting distracted in analysis paralysis
[00:41:30] <MrMister> searching for the right libraries to use, etc
[00:41:33] <MiracleBlue> Analysis paralysis?
[00:41:35] <MiracleBlue> Ahhhh yes
[00:41:48] <MiracleBlue> Man, I've been stuck in that for a while now.
[00:42:09] <MiracleBlue> I've gotta snap out of it.
[00:42:40] <MrMister> yup. when stuck, pick the first thing that comes to mind, you'll probably think of something halfway through and then you'll feel good about reiterating though it again
[00:43:12] <MiracleBlue> Alright :D
[00:43:13] <MrMister> just crank through to get something working, then re-implement
[00:43:55] <MiracleBlue> Thanks for the advice.  I'm gonna give that a try.  Just gotta stop over-thinking it and get on with coding.
[00:44:33] <MrMister> (note: this only applies when stuck in a motivational sense. It is usually worth the time to make solid design choices /if/ you know what those choices are)
[00:44:56] <MrMister> if you don't know, you will know at the end of the project :)
[00:45:02] <MiracleBlue> Yep, I know what you mean :)
[00:45:26] <clocKwize> so guys, I have this gist: https://gist.github.com/4073246
[00:45:27] <MrMister> yup. write more, deliberate less
[00:45:48] <MiracleBlue> You're a gentleman and a scholar :D
[00:45:49] <clocKwize> but the hook of stopPropagation is causing some weirdness - but what side effects can this code have?
[00:46:57] <MrMister> NodeX: thanks for your help. This is what I was talking about (see the second example)- it is a bit counter-intuitive, but it works in my case. Very strange to end with the selector though
[01:13:09] <MiracleBlue> MrMister: I'm finally making progress :D
[01:15:08] <aqeel> hi room
[01:15:14] <MiracleBlue> Heya
[01:17:12] <Qdest> Anyone able to help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/9kH3X/ <-- for some reason, when hovering the menus "fast", or simply put spamming them, some of them get stuck in the up-state. How could I fix this?
[01:18:52] <MrMister> NodeX: I forgot to paste the link: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/delegate-vs-on
[01:21:53] <aqeel> can give coordinate, if mouse pointer not with in required coordinate must be down state
[01:23:20] <MrMister> Qdest, have you figured out why they are stuck up?
[01:23:24] <MrMister> stuck class?
[01:23:32] <MrMister> mouseleave not firing?
[01:23:42] <Qdest> MrMister: Not really.. I think it's because I'm using .queue() and it can't well.. it's not fast enough or it skips?
[01:25:14] <aqeel> MrMister http://www.andismith.com/blog/2011/11/on-and-off/
[01:25:15] <Qdest> MrMister: It's the animation to top: 0; that isn't working (or being triggered) for that element which leads me to believe it's the .queue() that doesn't get fired or, fails cause there's so many when "spamming"
[01:28:51] <MrMister> thanks aqeel, it seems non-intuitive, but it is. It only look strange because of the formatting of the eventsMap. without a map the syntax looks fine, with the map it pushes the selector farther down.  Thanks for the link, it filled in some gaps for me
[01:29:35] <aqeel> you are welcome
[01:32:09] <Qdest> Anyone have any suggestions what I can do instead of .queue()? It seems when spamming the boxes some of the queued actions are missed hence the boxes get stuck in the up-state. --> http://jsfiddle.net/9kH3X/
[01:33:35] <MrMister> Qdest, it seems like this is organized a bit strangley, the nested .on(endererer is a bit weird
[01:33:59] <MrMister> why not have explicit case for mouseenter and mouseleave in the .on(
[01:34:28] <MrMister> it may let you profile it more easily
[01:35:19] <Qdest> MrMister: even if I take the "endererer" out, as in mouseleave, it reacts the same way. So I still believe it's the queue function that fails
[01:35:43] <Trisox> ?deque
[01:35:47] <Qdest> eventually I'll make it a plugin etc etc but I need to get the functionality to work first, and it's not.. so the basic logic behind the idea isn't functioning as intended..
[01:35:54] <Qdest> Trisox: I should have a dequeue within the queue ?
[01:35:56] <aqeel> Qdest http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3395293/check-cursor-is-over-element
[01:36:25] <Trisox> http://api.jquery.com/dequeue/
[01:36:44] <aqeel> use hover with mouase eneter and mouse leave
[01:37:12] <aqeel> solid state if mouse is not hover thus mouse is leave
[01:37:46] <Qdest> aqeel: the trigger events aren't the issue here? I mean, .on( mouseleave/mouseenter ) should work just as good as :hover or so..?
[01:38:20] <aqeel> agree but sometime if there are issues better try what possible means are there...
[01:38:25] <Qdest> Trisox: I added a $(this).dequeue(); within the .queue() and it didn't really help - although it isn't spammable any more as it really takes its time to complete the animations but somehow hickups are made
[01:38:54] <Qdest> aqeel: true, but I'm pretty convinced it's the .queue() that's delating the animations/skipping them
[01:39:00] <Qdest> delaying*
[01:39:02] <aqeel> instead of mouse enter and mouse leave have u tried hover
[01:41:46] <Qdest> aqeel: I just tried .hover() - same thing happening
[01:43:41] <Trisox> well if seen an working example while back dont know what it was any more
[01:44:34] <Trisox> bigger question is do you realy need animation for this
[01:46:59] <Qdest> Trisox: well, I don't think it's the actual animation - think it's the way it animates, using queue(). I need some other way since the queue gets filled and for some reason not entirely executed when it gets too many requests or whatnot
[01:53:32] <MiracleBlue> Anyone with handlebars knowledge around?
[01:59:43] <Trisox> Qdest: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/9kH3X/4/
[02:01:18] <Trisox> animation fails now only shadow works :|
[02:02:05] <Qdest> Trisox: doh, well it's kinda the whole idea :P

[02:18:05] <wiremaster> okay... why does *this* happen? http://jsfiddle.net/dA4yv/1/
[02:19:50] <tlkr> ha wtf :D
[02:20:31] <wiremaster> :)
[02:20:58] <tlkr> wiremaster, http://jsfiddle.net/dA4yv/2/
[02:22:05] <wiremaster> tlkr, that outputs nothing and only the HTML is shown...?
[02:22:41] <wiremaster> removing the array key makes it show something again
[02:23:26] <wiremaster> The main concern is still this though: http://jsfiddle.net/MePVf/
[02:23:27] <tlkr> i'm half asleep
[02:23:46] <tlkr> the $('h2') selector is selecting multiple elements
[02:24:01] <tlkr> if you want to write all of them out you need to loop through the matched elements
[02:24:45] <wiremaster> once matched, the element becomes unavailable to the interpreter?
[02:26:14] <wiremaster> okay, removing the dots in http://jsfiddle.net/MePVf/ fixed it :(
[02:26:22] <wiremaster> no dot love? dash it.
[02:29:27] <JaredCE> is it possible to dynamically update an .ajax url after certain events happen
[02:30:20] <tlkr> wiremaster, i've just realised why your initial problem wasn't working.
[02:30:41] <tlkr> document.write($('h2').html()) will empty the page, therefore next time you search for h2 it will not exist.
[02:30:45] * tlkr bangs his head
[02:30:53] <wiremaster> oh, haha
[02:33:42] <harami> helo, if you click on left or right of thumbnails you will see them sliding out fast, how can i slow that slide down http://198.58.86.52/~rondaf/gallery/under-water/
[02:52:37] <Kingsy> if I have a php script that I am calling with .get() and its a loop that say echos "hello" 100,000 times. with a standard .get() that returns data it will wait until the script executes and return ALL of the echos at once. is it possible to get the echos one by one? i.e to see its progress?
[02:56:18] <kaine> Typically you show a loading animation then
[02:57:01] <Kingsy> ah right, you would need to pass in the values via the js I guess and return them each time

[03:14:20] <mikecmpbll> fiddled it..
[03:15:14] <mikecmpbll> seems to be do with how i'm positioning it outside the div, damn, that's obvious i guess.
[03:15:16] <faraway> mikecmpbll: it is the margin -20
[03:15:37] <faraway> mikecmpbll: -10 :)  yes that the reason
[03:16:06] <mikecmpbll> hmm, guess i need to put add a content div then
[03:17:15] <faraway> mikecmpbll: actually the problem is, that for doing the sliding animation, overflow: hidden is applyed by jquery to #container  so everything outside get inivisible immediately
[03:17:15] <mikecmpbll> fixed. http://jsfiddle.net/eeZzU/1/ thanks faraway !

[06:19:28] <koopajah> milligan > you need to create the datepicker first and then call your line to change the dateformat. If you want to start the datepicker with a specific format do this : $("#arrival').datepicker({ dateFormat: "yy-mm-dd" });
[06:19:59] <milligan> Yep - got it :) Can I also have it fill in the textbox automatically upon init?

[06:21:05] <aqeel> specially the window.load part
[06:23:21] <koopajah> milligan> not sure you can do it with a default option? but in the function beforeShow you can retrieve the default date and put it in the input? http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-beforeShow

[06:46:55] <koopajah> vedder_ > retrieve the value that you add in the field ".tableTotal" before putting the new one. And then take your total value labelResult, decrease from previous total and add new total

[06:47:28] <vedder_> koopajah:  that was what i was trying to do

[07:14:51] <ShawnRisk> pachet: mess as in all of the slides at once.
[07:15:02] <ShawnRisk> pachet: yes but how?
[07:15:11] <pachet> ShawnRisk: use CSS to keep them out of the flow until they are loaded

[07:19:22] <timwis> Good morning, I have a jsonp $.ajax() call that's getting a 500 response from the server very quickly - I can see it in the console/network tab. But for some reason the error function isn't triggered until the timeout variable is reached. Whereas with regular json (not jsonp) it's triggered as soon as the server responds with the 500 error. Any idea why?
[07:19:41] <scalex000> pachet, I have a dude Im getting error on code but its very strange in another webserver work good but in mine not

[07:35:27] <pachet> ShawnRisk: you can keep the code you have, if it works (a working jsfiddle would be a better demonstration of that)
[07:35:51] <pachet> i was just saying that you should style your images to be hidden initially, to prevent the FOUC

[07:38:11] <karolyi> is it normal that when i do a removeClass() on an element which is hidden, the class is not changed on the element in the DOM ?
[07:38:26] <karolyi> this might be a bug
[07:38:28] <jvanveen> hey
[07:38:43] <jvanveen> is it possible to use find to exclude the first items in a result set?
[07:38:43] <koopajah> karolyi > in the DOM? or in the elements panel ?
[07:38:49] <jvanveen> like $(tabElements).find(':not(:first').each(function(idx, elem){});
[07:39:00] <jvanveen> somehow it crashes
[07:39:13] <jvanveen> or should i just add the :first selector to $() ?
[07:39:23] <karolyi> koopajah: in the dom and in the elements panel too (FF/Chromium)
[07:39:55] <seutje> jvanveen: since ur each()ing anyway, just check idx in there?
[07:40:01] <Trisox> ShawnRisk: i should make it a jquery plugin ;-)
[07:40:16] <ShawnRisk> Trisox: pardon?
[07:40:20] <seutje> jvanveen: the syntax is ur find is off btw
[07:40:20] <jvanveen> seutje: good plan. thanks!
[07:40:30] <Trisox> well init part and event part
[07:40:34] <koopajah> karolyi > you mean, in the console, if you do for example  $("#hidden").removeClass("test"). Then when you do $("#hidden") it still has the test class?
[07:40:45] <Trudko> guys right now I have selector $("#dropdown").find("[data-auth='Y']") which finds all options which have data-auth set to Y what I want do to is reverse so it would find all options which doesn NOT have data-auth set to Y
[07:40:50] <Trisox> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[07:40:51] <jvanveen> seutje: i should add the element in front probably?
[07:40:53] <karolyi> koopajah: wait i'll try
[07:41:08] <koopajah> did you think about removing the "." before the class name in   removeClass("test") ?
[07:41:09] <Trisox> you could use settings for example
[07:41:30] <seutje> jvanveen: perhaps, but that still won't work unless u close that bracket on the :not
[07:41:51] <Trisox> also your in the plugin "container" witch is better for preformence
[07:42:34] <jvanveen> seutje: checking on index is much more straightforward. i was making things too complicated
[07:45:54] <Raydiation> which elements can receive a keyup event?
[07:46:06] <karolyi> koopajah: this way it works, but there's a big BUT. i'm creating the element with $('<div/>') originally, then i insert it into the DOM. manipulating the classes on it is working that way, until the element gets hidden
[07:46:06] <Raydiation> i bound it to a div but its not working

[07:53:09] <koopajah> Raydiation > no i don't think clicking on a div gives it focus, especially if the div contains other divs etc. try elm.focus()
[07:53:23] <xec_> abletony84: there is a startingSlide option for the cycle plugin
[07:53:42] <koopajah> but as I said give focus to <div> element is not supported in every browser. Why don't use bind on the whole document ?

[08:14:34] <Narhir> at the end the "Slide" gots JUMP
[08:14:41] <Narhir> and it moves instantly like 50 pixels to the bottom
[08:14:42] <Narhir> ?
[08:14:52] <Narhir> what is it caused by and how it cna be fixed?
[08:15:09] <xec_> ShawnRisk: nope

[08:20:40] <davimusprime> Hello
[08:21:05] <xec_> ShawnRisk: nope. maybe there is a slider plugin that lets you lazyload the hidden slides?
[08:21:15] <abletony84> sec
[08:21:57] <xec_> abletony84: you don't need to tell me - when you know what you want to do, make an attempt to code it yourself. thinking in terms of steps usually help
[08:22:02] <ShawnRisk> xec_: yes I have seen all of this and would be great, but nothing you can do with the jsfiddle to make this work out?

[08:22:50] <Narhir> it give a bit of like 40-50px bump
[08:23:05] <Narhir> it doesnt slide out fluently it have a little jump of 40px at the end

[08:30:24] <zfly9> Hey guys can someone help me with this? I want to have one jQuery function to run at the end of another function's load, is this hard to do?
[08:31:12] <zfly9> Basically I have a contact form that is created via JS, then I have a jQuery function that styles the dropdown <select> part of a form, but it doesn't work since they both load at the same time, the form needs to load first
[08:31:18] <zfly9> any help is much appreciated..
[08:31:23] <black_warlock> hi
[08:31:36] <ShawnRisk> Narhir: yes because you have the search button that need to be pushed down
[08:31:56] <Narhir> hmm I see.. so.. how can I make it not to act like that?
[08:32:20] <abletony84> xec_: sorry i thought u meant write down the steps
[08:32:25] <Narhir> I need this search button for both situations
[08:32:29] <Narhir> basic search and advanced search :/
[08:32:35] <abletony84> i get ur point tho
[08:32:36] <Narhir> any ideas how else should I make it happen ?
[08:32:38] <Taar779_w> zfly9: how is the form being generated? Ajax?
[08:33:04] <aqeel> y not use css for style
[08:33:47] <zfly9> Taar779_w I'm not sure I believe it's just finding the ID and doing a doc write html code
[08:34:01] <zfly9> aqeel me?
[08:34:07] <aqeel> yes
[08:34:23] <zfly9> because the <select> drop down box isn't very customizable
[08:34:25] <zfly9> via css
[08:34:40] <zfly9> looks fine in chome, but safari etc uses it's own style
[08:34:55] <ShawnRisk> Narhir: I think it is because of it loading too slow.  Try faster.  Also might be css.  I can't really say
[08:35:12] <Narhir> thanks
[08:35:18] <Taar779_w> zfly9: could you paste us some code?

[08:40:03] <aqeel> http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/10/04/custom-drop-down-list-styling/
[08:40:07] <zfly9> aqeel, no but the jQuery transforms it to divs & spans
[08:40:10] <zfly9> so they can be customized
[08:40:41] <Narhir> ShawnRisk:  I need bigger one too ;p lkike 27 inches
[08:40:52] <ShawnRisk> 100 inches
[08:41:16] <aqeel> the y not make use of class and style with css
[08:41:26] <aqeel> if div and spans
[08:42:02] <zfly9> once it changes it do divs and spans I can customize it just fine
[08:42:26] <zfly9> that's not the problem, the problem is that it's loading in parallel with the contact form and needs to load after the contact form loads
[08:42:33] <aqeel> any working site or jsfiddle

[08:44:54] <aqeel> and which link leads to form

[08:47:03] <black_warlock> no bobody ?
[08:48:27] <aqeel> threre is no drop down .....tel,name,email and commnet
[08:49:18] <aqeel> also there is overlap of your contents....pink area hides portion of green area
[08:50:07] <zfly9> aqeel, the plugin hides the <select> and places the customizable content
[08:50:21] <zfly9> so since it doesn't load right, all you see is the hide
[08:50:33] <zfly9> inspect the blank area and go to the <select> and uncheck both hides

[08:56:07] <ShawnRisk> I am using $(document).ready but I want to have the slideshow load in the background and only show the active slide. Â How do I do this? Â Right now all the slides load at once and than this goes to the first slide or you see the first slide with no image and than the image loads a few seconds later. Â Any ideas? jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/20/
[08:56:14] <ShawnRisk> NoiseEee: ^
[08:56:43] <aqeel> zfly9:  you need to organize your flow and there are multiple repeat ocasions of your css too
[08:57:03] <zfly9> aqeel it's not the css, I will clean that up later
[08:57:50] <jerry_> guys i have image ...and i would like when i click on it to show blow up version another image(which is bigger) which is also image map.......can someone point me what should i be looking at here
[08:57:51] <zfly9> I can call it 100 times in css, it's not going to affect anything
[08:58:33] <aqeel> things like visibility, display do effect
[08:59:08] <aqeel> visibility:hidden; display:none;
[08:59:40] <jerry_> anyone?
[09:01:23] <ShawnRisk> NoiseEee: any thoughts?
[09:01:49] <NoiseEee> ShawnRisk: sorry im busy
[09:02:05] <ShawnRisk> no worries
[09:03:14] <aqeel> ShawnRisk: u want to load according to slide or all contents then show relevent slide
[09:04:37] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: I want to load all the content and then show the relevant show like this does now.  I just don't want all the slides to show up at once ontop of the other before moving to the first slide.
[09:05:52] <ShawnRisk> second show = slide
[09:06:24] <aqeel> case 1, well it is working fine
[09:06:33] <aqeel> there are no overlap
[09:06:53] <BoomerEt> Is there a way to disable the 'X' (close) on a dialog from UI? Maybe hide the graphic?
[09:07:14] <thesumo> I have a question about the jQueryUI Sortable plugin.  I have a list of li items that are activated to be sortable when a checkbox associated with them is checked.  WHen the box is unchecked, they are no longer sortable.  As it stands, when you activate or deactivate them, it is done in place, i.e., you can have unactivated ones in between activated ones.  I wanted to know if there was a way to cause activated ones to jump to the
[09:07:14] <thesumo> top of the list and deactivated ones to jump to the top of the unactivated list.
[09:07:18] <BoomerEt> Maybe I'm just not thinking through how I want to display information to my users.
[09:08:03] <aqeel> the window cannot lose controls, so u have to make custom popup which does not make use of window.open
[09:10:32] <draginx> Does anyone else have problems with flotjs, large sets of data, and FireFox?
[09:12:08] <danmichel> I noticed something in my webpagetest. I am modifying the slider on my test site, http://theplural.com/ to include a placeholder image. it works marvelously.
[09:12:17] <danmichel> However, if you'll notice on the live site's screenshot, http://d.pr/rnrt the slideshow fits perfect in width, but on the test site with the placeholder, the width of the placeholder image is large(not responsive) http://d.pr/2KqI .
[09:12:19] <ideaprison> Anyone know why my scrolling detection does not work properly in firefox? http://pastebin.com/mxTf6xtE it runs the else on any direction of scrolling
[09:12:31] <danmichel>  i think it might have something to do with the javascript of the slideshow giving .orbit-wrapper a dynamic width and/or height. https://gist.github.com/4079534 . if you'll notice on http://theplural.com , the placeholder_wrapper is not in the same div as the slideshow wrapper 'orbit-wrapper' .
[09:12:45] <danmichel> Anybody think they can help me duplicate  whatever function/code the slider javascript uses only for the width and height of placeholder_wrapper?
[09:12:50] <ideaprison> or i should probably ask how to detect it like i am for the other browsers that do work
[09:13:54] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: on load there is for me.
[09:14:27] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: You can see that there is overlap and than the first slide loads
[09:15:31] <davimusprime> Can I bug anybody about the use of dataTables here? http://datatables.net
[09:16:01] <aqeel> what i see is the cat and title, live on cbc radio, is this first one
[09:16:55] <aqeel> and then fades to second , third,fourth
[09:17:03] <aqeel> i do not see any overlap???
[09:17:37] <aqeel> i might not be understanding as to what overlap you are speaking of
[09:18:19] <dogarrhea> http://jsfiddle.net/JDAgp/7/  need explanation. the timeout for printing the '1' out has a longer timeout length. yet it is printed after the '2' which has a shorter timeout length.
[09:19:12] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: one sec
[09:19:49] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: on the jsfiddle it is quiet fast but there is overlap of things.  If you want I can send you to the live site and you can see this.
[09:20:36] <aqeel> or may be change the time of load and see if indeed overlap occurs
[09:20:37] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/pkyLp/ anyone know why this works perfectly in Chrome but not in FF?
[09:21:34] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: or push run in jsfiddle and you will see this.
[09:21:57] <aqeel> i didi that many times and see no diference
[09:22:31] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: I see this all the time.
[09:22:54] <aqeel> screenshot please...
[09:23:27] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: I sent you the dev site
[09:23:44] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: you will be able to see it there.  The jsfiddle is too fast to screenshot
[09:24:01] <aqeel> ok
[09:25:19] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: it is backup now
[09:26:02] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: there is no overlap but the image loads after the text and I don't want the slide to load until the image is loaded.
[09:29:31] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: do you see that?
[09:29:39] <vedder_> can anyone tell me why im not getting the total amount  correctly below my table when i add a new row ... http://jsfiddle.net/3zV2G/
[09:29:55] <aqeel> i do not see any image  loaded
[09:30:09] <aqeel> only text and cosmetics

[09:30:31] <Taar779_w> draginx: firefox doesn't completely support canvas
[09:30:40] <draginx> Taar779_w: oh so I need excanvas?
[09:31:24] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: do you see a slide called Comprehensive Guide to ADD?  I have loaded back in the slideshow, it was hidden before.  I will read that site right now.
[09:32:02] <Taar779_w> draginx: possibly, the only thing firefox doesn't completely support is WebGL - 3D
[09:33:04] <flat_eric> i've got another question. does anybody of you have already earned experiences with programming a calendar? i think about if it is better using divs instead of cells in the table. what do u mean?
[09:33:12] <draginx> Taar779_w: nah added excanvas and still didnt work http://jsfiddle.net/pkyLp/1/
[09:33:12] <Taar779_w> draginx: for more information on what browsers support check out this site http://caniuse.com/
[09:33:35] <ShawnRisk> aqeel: if you don't see that than that is okay I will read the page and see what I can do
[09:33:50] <draginx> FireFox seems to do a better job than CHrome actually
[09:34:07] <Taar779_w> draginx: yeah than it might be the fact that it doesn't completely support WebGL - 3D as of yet
[09:34:07] <aqeel> i guess no choice, i do not see and ovelap occuring at my side
[09:34:17] <aqeel> seems fine and functional
[09:34:23] <draginx> Taar779_w: flotjs uses webgl 3d? :/
[09:34:56] <Taar779_w> draginx: I'm not sure, it's just a guess. I would look into that.
[09:37:50] <flat_eric> somebody, please? =)

[09:41:56] <aqeel> yes
[09:42:08] <ShawnRisk> okay good
[09:43:05] <flat_eric> i'll repeat my question: does anybody of you have already earned experiences with programming a calendar? i think about if it is better using divs instead of cells in the table. what do u mean?

[10:06:18] <therealklanni> When using jqUI Widget Factory, how can I wait for the widget to be created?
[10:18:43] <Kahamri> I have a site I'm working on that's redirects to a mobile version. I need to change some stuff up and am trying to figure out how it detects and redirects. It's not in .htaccess, javascript or php. Is that the only 3 ways?
[10:19:31] <royalty> what other ways were you thinking about?
[10:20:34] <Kahamri> I'm not sure if there isn't a way to redirect that I havn't thought of. I havn't found how it's doing it.
[10:20:43] <Kahamri> I figure there is a method I havn't thought of
[10:21:02] <royalty> why would you want to use another method than those three?
[10:21:40] <Kahamri> I would'nt, but I didn't build the site. it's something i inherited
[10:22:10] <royalty> so what are you trying to do? make it redirect?
[10:23:13] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible to modify a chunk of html inside <head>? I'm not sure if (since it's not inside <body>) whether a span or div is allowed to wrap it, etc.... I'm wanting to change the stylesheets loaded on the fly and I'm also curious if removing a 'link' entry (or modifying the href) would load the new stylesheet
[10:23:33] <johnkpaul> tomasm-: removing a link tag doesn't remove the stylesheet
[10:23:39] <johnkpaul> adding a new link tag, would add another stylesheet
[10:23:49] <johnkpaul> removing a stylesheet entirely is not simple, IIRC
[10:23:59] <Kahamri> The company added a signup form for a giveaway. I need to take the url and if mobile, redirect to a php file but I would like to keep all their if mobile code in the same place/way
[10:24:26] <royalty> in what way is their mobile code written?
[10:25:03] <tomasm-> johnkpaul, so maybe then is it best to prefix all the style definitions with a unique label? ie body#layout123 and in layout123.css have "#layout123 rule1..."
[10:26:16] <royalty> Kahmari, if the check is in javascript you might be able to redirect via ajax
[10:26:25] <Kahamri> royalty: no, I can't find anything on their site that detects mobile. .htaccess is what most the site's I've gotten use, but I've seen javascript files and php code too. this site just magically does it
[10:26:28] <danmichel> I noticed something in my webpagetest. I am modifying the slider on my test site, http://theplural.com/ to include a placeholder image. it works marvelously.

[10:27:03] <danmichel> Anybody think they can help me duplicate  whatever function/code the slider javascript uses only for the width and height of placeholder_wrapper?
[10:27:47] <danmichel> I tried  a JSfiddle, but that's not working http://jsfiddle.net/VEBWN/ so I guess the test site http://theplural.com is the only reference
[10:28:04] <fonko> guys anyone knows of a really great jquery plug-in for google maps?
[10:28:24] <fonko> for example something that let you use different images for different markers?
[10:30:06] <tomasm-> johnkpaul, so is this tutorial bogus? http://www.webgeekly.com/tutorials/jquery/how-to-switch-css-files-on-the-fly-using-jquery/
[10:31:34] <johnkpaul> hmm tomasm-, yes, I think it is
[10:31:42] <johnkpaul> potentially my memory is not serving me well
[10:31:46] <johnkpaul> you can check in a fiddle easily
[10:31:52] <johnkpaul> add a css file, and remove it using JS
[10:32:26] <systemfault> tomasm-: The functionality seems good, the code is really awful
[10:32:35] <royalty> how would i reference an element right before another element?
[10:33:09] <Wayneman> hello all :)
[10:33:19] <systemfault> royalty: define: before
[10:33:37] <systemfault> royalty: as the parent element? or the sibling before?
[10:33:50] <royalty> so let us say I have in html <p> foo </p> <div> hello </div> and I want to reference the paragraph element but I only have <div>
[10:33:58] <royalty> to work with
[10:33:58] <systemfault> .prev()
[10:34:04] <royalty> ah okay thanks
[10:34:55] <Wayneman> anyone familiar with using the jqueryui accordion widget with a filtered collection in backbone.js?
[10:35:28] <Wayneman> accordion renders fine initially, but not after I filter the collection
[10:37:00] <ShishKabab> Is it possible to download the latest 1.7 docs? I'm travelling and working right now, so don't always have access to internet when working.
[10:39:52] <chinoto> is there a way to detect dom insertions and specific attribute changes?
[10:40:57] <systemfault> chinoto: Not in a portable way AFAIK
[10:41:16] <karolyi> how can it be that a mousedown event's callback is executer later, than a blur event's callback, but the timestamp for the mousedown event tells that it was sensed earlier?
[10:41:52] <chinoto> systemfault: hmm
[10:42:30] <chinoto> I'm trying to write my own placeholder polyfill since the others I've seen don't quite cut it
[10:43:27] <systemfault> chinoto: You're using the blur/focus events ?
[10:44:15] <systemfault> chinoto: Also, have you looked on that page? https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills
[10:44:53] <MistuhKurtz> chinoto, why don' tthey cut it?
[10:44:56] <chinoto> aye, it's already working for that bit, but I need a way to detect newly created inputs and put the placeholder text in, and also I need to detect placeholder attribute changes so I can mimic that as well
[10:45:57] <tomasm-> johnkpaul, i actually just tried out changing the css on the fly (via a <link> that had an id set) and changed the href and it works in chrome, firefox and IE.... what gave you the impression it wouldn't work?
[10:46:05] <chinoto> most require explicit calling per element  and only work on those, not ones created afterward
[10:46:27] <johnkpaul> tomasm-: did the new file override all of the orignal css?
[10:46:28] <chinoto> then again, maybe I should retest that
[10:46:36] <johnkpaul> what I think wouldn't work is if you remove that link tag, that the page becomes unstyled
[10:46:50] <tomasm-> johnkpaul, the link tag was never removed... it was changed
[10:46:53] <systemfault> chinoto: Then you should abandon the idea :/
[10:47:02] <johnkpaul> yeah, I know tomasm-
[10:47:02] <tomasm-> johnkpaul, i will add some styles in some that aren't mentioned in others, see what happens
[10:47:11] <johnkpaul> cool
[10:47:15] <MistuhKurtz> chinoto, I feel like you could write your own code outside of the plugin to handle that stuff
[10:47:19] <MistuhKurtz> especially for newly created inputs
[10:47:39] <MistuhKurtz> what attr changes do you need to listen for?
[10:48:19] <chinoto> the problem is I don't know how to listen for attr changes or dom insertions
[10:48:28] <MistuhKurtz> well there is no attr change event
[10:48:30] <royalty> hello why is this not working? http://jsfiddle.net/ucArE/
[10:48:40] <MistuhKurtz>  a quick google shows there are some possible hacks
[10:48:53] <MistuhKurtz> but why not just execute the code you need in the function that's changing the attribute?
[10:48:56] <MistuhKurtz> same with DOM insertions
[10:49:14] <vedder_> can anyone tell me why im not getting the total amount  correctly below my table when i add a new row ... http://jsfiddle.net/3zV2G/
[10:50:05] <fission6> how can i get an objects keys
[10:50:24] <chinoto> all I've got so far is a check to see if placeholder is already supported and the focus/blur event code
[10:51:51] <MistuhKurtz> after evaluating some placeholder polyfills i ended up going with this one chinoto: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder
[10:52:50] <sayd> could someone help me with this function, i feel like there may be a better way to write it : https://gist.github.com/1514510c7cd081c14c5c
[10:54:30] <tomasm-> johnkpaul, so i have some css rules in some of the stylesheet files and not others and all the browsers seem to remove it once the link href is changed.... ie the old css is stripped out
[10:54:36] <tomasm-> w00t
[10:54:44] <johnkpaul> oh ok, cool tomasm-, glad you figured it out
[10:54:48] <johnkpaul> and thanks for letting me know
[10:55:11] <john-dev> royalty, becuase it's jQuery, not JQuery
[10:55:15] <tomasm-> this eliminates the need for a preview button/image, etc...
[10:55:20] <chinoto> MistuhKurtz: I've seen it before, but I figured it wouldn't work with inputs created after the page loads, but I never did check :/
[11:00:11] <Caelum> does calling .val() on a hidden field fire it's onchange handler?
[11:00:29] <Woet> Caelum: tias
[11:00:40] <Caelum> no I just did this yesterday, you ahve to do .val().change()
[11:00:59] <Woet> okay, why are you asking then?
[11:01:11] <Caelum> because I just remembered after I asked
[11:01:18] <Woet> I see
[11:01:22] <Woet> gotta upgrade that memory speed
[11:01:58] <royalty> john-dev: thank you!
[11:02:00] <MistuhKurtz> chinoto, nothing is going to automagically work with new DOM insertions
[11:02:06] <MistuhKurtz> you're gonna have to instantiate it on those new insertions again
[11:02:32] <Caelum> I used livequery to put events on new elements
[11:02:48] <MistuhKurtz> $('form').append('<input />').placeholder();
[11:03:21] <MistuhKurtz> I don't know how livequery works but I'm certain it introduces overhead
[11:03:49] <MistuhKurtz> sounds like it's just a plugin to replace live()
[11:08:21] <vedder_> can anyone tell me why im not getting the total amount  correctly below my table when i add a new row ... http://jsfiddle.net/3zV2G/
[11:08:48] <HyShai> Why doesn't  .each() work with hasClass() ?  http://jsfiddle.net/QR2ex/5/
[11:09:03] <NoiseEee> vedder_: because you're not calling updateTotal() after you add a row?
[11:10:28] <vedder_> NoiseEee:  it doesnt work neither
[11:10:41] <HyShai> meh nvm had it set to noWrap, rather than domReady

[11:17:00] <fission6> i thought if inputs had no value they did not get passed to the server side?
[11:17:24] <chinoto> as far as I know, they do
[11:17:45] <chinoto> may depend on the browser
[11:18:10] <fission6> well i am getting a values from a dropdown and when the user selects a value i want to forward to that page, where the item selected is passed as a query string
[11:18:14] <fission6> so i was going to just submit the form
[11:21:16] <fission6> whatever i am going to make a dummy form on the page with hidden fields and just sibmit it

[11:38:36] <JFranks> Hmmm .. when I try to point to Google's CDN for jQuery/UI includes on a blog I get a cross-site scripting error that goes away when I put the files on the same domain as the blog. I tried to read the post about it on the Chromium blog but my brain isn't awake yet.. Is there a way to declare a <script> that will prevent this and allow me to point to Google's CDN?
[11:43:09] <TelFiRE> So, slidetoggle doesn't behave that well on mobile devices. It would seem a simple enough behavior, but the animate() equivalent isn't that great either. What's a way to get it to perform smoothly? Or is this just tough on web?
[11:46:00] <fission6> can you directly submit a form and populate values
[11:48:00] <Caelum> fission6: you mean ajax form submit? jquery form plugin does that
[11:49:56] <tubbo> is there a way to fire an event to ui.autocomplete that tells it to position itself?
[11:50:38] <tubbo> i have a "No results." message that shows up when a user types in terms that result in an empty dataset, but i can't get it to position correctly on the page. and before hacking the shit out of it with CSS, i wanted to see if there was just something i can call on the plugin to make it do what i want
[11:51:08] <tubbo> clearly, this code is being run in some sort of listener, because ui.autocomplete ONLY positions correctly when real data comes back.
[11:51:16] <tubbo> otherwise it does nothing
[11:51:41] <thinkt4nk> tubbo did you look at the events supported by autocomplete?
[11:55:08] <tubbo> thinkt4nk: well i did, but i just saw docs and no examples. would i trigger the open event by doing $('#search').trigger('ui.autocomplete.open')
[11:55:16] <tubbo> or something?
[11:56:43] <thinkt4nk> no, you provide a handler for the event in the options

[11:59:33] <anew> if i use button 3, it only works for button 1 etc
[12:00:37] <thinkt4nk> Caelum the reason is because you're trying to invoke an object as a function
[12:00:48] <thinkt4nk> function in your example is probably a NodeList object
[12:00:52] <anew> anyone ?
[12:02:06] <Caelum> thinkt4nk: thank you
[12:02:51] <thinkt4nk> np
[12:03:09] <anew> thinkt4nk can u help me ?
[12:04:43] <Caelum> thinkt4nk: I called my function and my radio buttons the same name, that was causing it
[12:05:05] <kaaaaasper> Hello. Can anyone tell me if there just was an update with a bug causing transitions to "shiver" a bit..?
[12:06:09] <anew> anyone can help me please ??
[12:08:45] <tevfik> anew about what?
[12:09:38] <anew> tevfik i cant get this fiddle to work http://jsfiddle.net/92TfS/
[12:09:57] <tubbo> thinkt4nk: oh, so i'd do something like $('#search').autocomplete({ open: function() { .. } });
[12:10:04] <Caelum> if I have <td><input 1></td><td><input 2></td> and this is "input 2" how do I get "input 1"
[12:10:51] <tubbo> Caelum: $('td input').first()
[12:11:03] <tubbo> pretty sure.. :)
[12:11:17] <tubbo> want it as a DOM object? $('td input')[0]
[12:11:44] <Caelum> tubbo: but there are many rows, and it needs to be relative to 'this'
[12:12:06] <systemfault> Caelum: myInput.closest('td').prev().find('input')
[12:12:15] <ajpiano> $("input:first-child")
[12:12:35] <anew> tevfik please i have to get it to work for each id and class individually, does that mean i have to write seperate functions for each id and class ?
[12:13:13] <tubbo> Caelum: that's not what you asked :)
[12:13:31] <tubbo> Caelum: i had a feeling you were looking for something a bit more in-depth...
[12:13:55] <thinkt4nk> tubbo yes
[12:14:56] <ajpiano> Caelum: var inputs = $("td input"), currentIndex = inputs.index( this ), prior = inputs.eq( currentIndex - 1 );
[12:15:36] <systemfault> A bit brittle, no?
[12:15:39] <Caelum> systemfault, ajpiano: thank you very much
[12:15:57] <anew> ajpiano can u help me, i cant get this fiddle
[12:16:02] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/92TfS/
[12:16:25] <Caelum> ajpiano: are you the author of flexigrid?
[12:16:29] <ajpiano> no
[12:16:45] <Caelum> sorry, thought that was you
[12:16:45] <ajpiano> i am not the author of flexigride
[12:17:45] <ajpiano> anew: sorry i can't look at that now
[12:18:28] <ajpiano> anew: wait a sec
[12:18:35] <ajpiano> what is the deal with that aeImageResize plugin
[12:18:43] <r--> LOLOLOLOL OMFG LOL ROFLCOPTER FUCK
[12:18:45] <ajpiano> it is wrirten explicitly to not support going over the element collection
[12:18:46] <r--> LOL!
[12:18:48] <r--> etc.
[12:19:01] <ajpiano> etc.
[12:19:03] <tevfik> anew: Wait a min I'm gonna try to fix your code
[12:19:05] <r--> wtf bro?
[12:19:07] <r--> why
[12:19:10] <anew> ajpiano - the onclick is being applied to all the <img> i just need to know how to make it go thru each one individually i.e. if i click button 2, it is applied to 1, button 3 is applied to 1
[12:19:10] <r--> i was just lollin'
[12:19:12] <anew> they all go to 1
[12:19:37] <ajpiano> anew: the plugin explcitly only works on the first element in the collection, as written
[12:19:44] <r--> jag mo
[12:19:46] <anew> oh
[12:19:50] <anew> shit... how do i fix that ?
[12:19:56] <anew> i'm going craZy
[12:20:13] <anew> please i want to die
[12:20:35] <ajpiano> anew: no wonder you are not a doctor
[12:20:40] <ajpiano> you have no patience >:|
[12:20:44] <ajpiano> anew: something like this should work http://jsfiddle.net/92TfS/2/
[12:20:55] <anew> yes kill me now, been trying for so long
[12:21:29] <ajpiano> r--: that type of thing doesn't fly in any large public IRC channel
[12:21:35] <ajpiano> which you probably know already
[12:22:03] <ajpiano> anew: ^^ that example just uses an explicit each and doesn't rewrite the plugin at all, it should work
[12:23:07] <anew> still not - before all 4 images were changing, now only the first one
[12:23:46] <ajpiano> sorry then
[12:24:00] <anew> argh thanks anyway
[12:24:02] <ajpiano> i can't get into debugging the minified source code of a plugin
[12:24:24] <anew> i guess if i just copy/past the function 4 times with 4 different ids/classes it will work
[12:24:51] <ajpiano> i'm not going to go on record recommending that as a solution
[12:25:02] <anew> it's either that or commit suicide
[12:25:02] <ajpiano> :p
[12:25:41] <Caelum> how do I get the actual node from a wrapped node
[12:25:49] <ajpiano> you forgot about "step debugging the code, interrogating the value of variables, figuring out where the errant/persistent reference to 'only the first one' is being made"
[12:26:07] <ajpiano> Caelum: jqobj[0] or jqobj.get(0)
[12:26:13] <anew> bleh i suck
[12:26:21] <Caelum> ajpiano: thank you
[12:27:16] <tubbo> ahh this suuuuuuuuuuuuuucks
[12:27:19] <tubbo> i hate jquery ui with a passion
[12:27:46] <anew> join the club
[12:30:27] <ajpiano> tubbo: there are a bunch of things you could try
[12:30:29] <tubbo> i think the point of jquery ui was to introduce people who have no business writing javascript into doing interesting things ;)
[12:30:34] <tubbo> which didn't work
[12:31:02] <ajpiano> tubbo: if you use a custom "source" function
[12:31:28] <sonotos> what's the problem with jquery ui?
[12:31:29] <ajpiano> you then take control of the data request yourself, and when nothing comes back, you can push a "no results found" entry into the dataset and then show that
[12:31:34] <tubbo> ajpiano: i am using a custom source, but my major issue is that when i display like a custom message, the autocomplete is positioned completely wrong.
[12:31:41] <ajpiano> tubbo: ok
[12:31:48] <ajpiano> why not use the popup widget from jquery ui
[12:31:55] <ajpiano> instead of forcing the positioning of the empty combo box
[12:32:03] <tubbo> because that's not what i was tasked to do.
[12:32:07] <tubbo> and it would look shitty
[12:32:20] <tubbo> ajpiano: i should mention that i don't use the resp() in the source fn
[12:32:36] <ajpiano> that probably isn't good
[12:34:05] <ajpiano> tubbo: so what are you doing?
[12:36:07] <tubbo> ajpiano: here's what i just changed it to: https://gist.github.com/d8e93b34a8b5204f741f
[12:36:24] <tubbo> ajpiano: it does work when i have results, but doesn't display the "No results." message when i have none.
[12:36:37] <tubbo> took out the hack that put the msg in there unpositioned..
[12:36:56] <ajpiano> tubbo: you should push an array with the single object in it
[12:38:33] <tubbo> ajpiano: hahaâ¦just saw that. everything seems to work now. :)
[12:38:42] <ajpiano> tubbo: :)
[12:38:43] <tubbo> gotta rtfm sometimes ;)
[12:38:55] <ajpiano> yeah, it's tempting to blame the tools
[12:39:16] <ajpiano> but like, often it ain't their fault :p
[12:42:12] <anew> ajpiano copy/pasting doesnt work either - same thing happens wtf
[12:42:52] <ajpiano> wtf indeed
[12:43:07] <anew> i renamed all the classes/ids
[12:43:09] <ajpiano> with an approach as rigourous as "copy, paste, and hope" i'm simply shocked that it didn't work
[12:43:26] <anew> lol
[12:43:35] <tevfik> anew: first of all you are naming all the object with same id careful on that
[12:43:40] <anew> i'm terrible at jquery, no way could i figure out how to edit a plugin
[12:43:43] <tevfik> i  couldn't get why your code doesn't work
[12:43:48] <tevfik> but i found a lib for you
[12:43:49] <tevfik> http://bgrins.github.com/filereader.js/
[12:43:57] <anew> tevfik u figured it out ?
[12:44:22] <tevfik> Nope dude. I'm still working I didn't work with FileReader before
[12:44:25] <tevfik> I'm trying
[12:46:57] <chinoto> well after looking through all of the placeholder polyfills at (https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills), it seems I'll have to use a dom-insert-event plugin with one to have something functional, James Allacardice's plugin seemed like it was working in one of my simple tests, but didn't work for where it's going to be used :/
[12:47:07] <chinoto> anyway, gotta go
[12:50:13] <anew> meh huge #fail but i copy/pasted it to work
[12:52:13] <wachpwnski> Odd question. Is it ok to define your functions in document ready?
[12:52:43] <fission6> does it have dom selectors
[12:52:52] <fission6> in short it doesn't matter wachpwnski
[12:53:02] <fission6> to put in inside a dom ready
[12:54:55] <finspin> hi. does anybody know of a ready made plugin which would display an animated circle around mouse pointer when the mouse button is clicked? kind of like what camtasia studio does (if you are familiar with the software).
[12:57:03] <tevfik> anew:
[12:57:10] <tevfik> you there
[12:57:28] <tevfik> http://jsfiddle.net/UmjDS/7/
[12:57:34] <tevfik> here is what you are searching
[12:59:14] <anew> tevfik here
[12:59:25] <anew> wow
[12:59:27] <anew> incredible
[12:59:41] <tevfik> what i did
[12:59:56] <tevfik> i just basically bind all the inputs different purpose
[13:00:17] <anew> amaZing
[13:00:30] <Caelum> I have an onclick handler for a radio button that does a $(this).removeAttr('checked'); return false; but when I try to "uncheck" the radio button, it still looks checked on the page
[13:00:43] <anew> one question now, on my live site, sometimes the image doesnt resiZe? happens pretty often, what is the cause of that ?
[13:05:34] <anew> seems to happen all the time, what is the cause of that ?
[13:08:06] <tevfik> because of your plugin
[13:09:17] <anew> tevfik the plugin is bad ?
[13:09:41] <tevfik> actually i didn't check it.
[13:10:08] <tevfik> you would do that with just simple css
[13:10:49] <hugo_moss> how can i load images in the background using ajax? is there a function that i can use like .ready() that is called after the entire page has loaded? anybody have a good tutorial for doing that?
[13:11:25] <sontek> Does jquery deferreds trigger any events so I can do .on("...") rather than .done() ?
[13:11:28] <anew> do what with css ?
[13:11:41] <weebs_> can someone tell me what I am doing wrong in trying to determine if a QueryString object is available ? http://jsfiddle.net/YZ2A8/ all the docs/samples I see are doing the same thing
[13:12:34] <systemfault> sontek: No, Deferreds are not events.
[13:12:51] <systemfault> sontek: You could Deferredize an event though
[13:12:53] <tevfik> http://jsfiddle.net/UmjDS/8/
[13:13:00] <tevfik> anew: here look
[13:13:33] <anew> tevfik ah better then i dont have to rely on the jq to load it
[13:13:42] <anew> hmmm well let me try that
[13:14:04] <anew> it could be the plugin because when i only have one div to resiZe it works... adding more screws it up
[13:15:02] <anew> actually will that even work? you need to function call aeimageresiZe()
[13:15:31] <weebs_> i keep getting error : Uncaught ReferenceError: Request is not defined
[13:16:22] <tevfik> nope browsers are handling it
[13:16:31] <tevfik> actually FileReader is not good method to use
[13:16:45] <tevfik> because you can have a difficulty on cross browsers
[13:16:49] <tevfik> especially older
[13:16:54] <tevfik> versions
[13:17:22] <anew> mmm ok so i shouldnt use this
[13:17:32] <ajpiano> tevfik: are you mutlu from the summit
[13:17:38] <anew> back to square one... i need to find another plugin
[13:18:15] <tevfik> ajpiano: nope
[13:18:24] <ajpiano> oh! alas
[13:19:13] <tevfik> anew: to do this, here is my suggestion. Use ajax and get everything a rest(json)
[13:19:23] <tevfik> as a rest*
[13:19:38] <systemfault> As HTTP you mean? :)
[13:20:26] <weebs_> tevfik .. can you take a look at my fiddle script? Can you see what is wrong with my Request.QueryString() ?  http://jsfiddle.net/YZ2A8/
[13:21:06] <tevfik> hahah systemfault you are right i was watching serious while i'm writing it :)
[13:21:14] <tevfik> series*
[13:22:01] <anew> tevfik ajax and resiZe then send back
[13:23:31] <tevfik> anew: definitely !
[13:23:46] <systemfault> Hmm, What is the Request object?
[13:23:48] <tevfik> weebs_: I'm looking
[13:23:51] <systemfault> Never heard of it
[13:23:58] <weebs_> thanks man
[13:24:12] <tevfik> yeah systemfault I agree with you. Let's see. :)
[13:25:12] <anew> damnit this thing doesnt work in ie anyway
[13:25:14] <tevfik> weebs_: First of all, I guess you copied this code from somewhere
[13:25:25] <tevfik> anew: told you :)
[13:25:27] <hlve> damn windows update.
[13:25:30] <hlve> My Current System Uptime: 2wks 55mins 8secs
[13:25:31] <hlve> time to reboot
[13:25:36] <anew> fu IE
[13:25:46] <tevfik> ck :P
[13:25:49] <hlve> I'm angry with IE10 at the moment
[13:25:50] <hlve> :{
[13:26:09] <weebs_> well.. I used a few different resources.. they all seem to say this is the way to do it?
[13:26:20] <anew> there goes 2 hours of my life... ok so resiZe with php send back and preview.... well if the jq doesnt work in ie the ajax preview wont work either will it ?
[13:26:34] <weebs_> what am I doing wrong?
[13:28:21] <tevfik> weebs_: There is no object or variable as a Request
[13:28:38] <tevfik> though, It's a Method or Function in C#
[13:28:41] <tevfik> I guess..
[13:29:56] <weebs_> so its not straightforward like this http://andrewu.co.uk/tools/request/
[13:30:08] <andrew9184> http://jsfiddle.net/tfy5b/1/
[13:30:21] <andrew9184> what am i missing here? seems like it says unexpected )
[13:30:27] <systemfault> weebs_: I get a 500
[13:30:28] <weebs_> oh... NM.. this guy is using a plugin type
[13:30:47] <TheSin> hi everyone, I have a hopefully quick and simple question.  I have a function, in said function I'm using .each(function() {, that the .each I have an check and if it fails I need the next value so I'm using return true which accouding to the .each() docs is the same as continue in a loop, the issue is that the original funciton is returning instead of the .each so the function ends instead of going to the next value, ideas?
[13:31:26] <tevfik> andrew9184: http://jsfiddle.net/tfy5b/2/
[13:31:51] <tevfik> weebs_: systemfault +1
[13:32:22] <andrew9184> ahh, it's been a long day
[13:32:23] <andrew9184> thank you
[13:32:31] <tevfik> :)
[13:33:00] <TheSin> oh wait that isn't true at all, the top level function isn't returning, the .each is stopping (break type behavior) instead of continue type behavior
[13:33:41] <andrew9184> tevfik: how would i do it with a variable, http://jsfiddle.net/tfy5b/3/
[13:34:10] <andrew9184> oops
[13:34:13] <tevfik> http://jsfiddle.net/tfy5b/5/
[13:35:01] <TheSin> nvm I figured it out ;)
[13:35:05] <andrew9184> nevermind, i was passing "foobar" instead of 'foobar'
[13:35:07] <andrew9184> fml
[14:10:02] <bil`> any suggestions for plugins to animate a number in an element like a div from 0 to some value
[14:13:53] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm trying to preload some images that I am using in a slider. http://pastebin.com/sULKaF3j
[14:14:11] <sunbeam> However, for some reason the images are still not properly preloaded (when I open the site, the images only loads 50% ) the slider
[14:14:17] <sunbeam> Any idea what I can try
[14:24:45] <ronson> I sometimes use $.when().then() in jquery, but wouldn't try {} finally {} also work?
[14:25:02] <ronson> And also provide the added benefit of catching errors
[14:26:38] <systemfault> ronson: Try using "try/catch" with async functions... you'll understand
[14:27:35] <ronson> systemfault:  so you're saying try { $.ajax(); $.ajax() } finally{  //do stuff } wont work?
[14:27:45] <ronson> if expecting results from ajax calls
[14:27:56] <systemfault> ronson: No, because the ajax calls are asynchronous
[14:28:09] <ronson> I see, thanks
[14:28:29] <ronson> I thought try { } was blocking regardless of asynchronous insides
[14:38:38] <nerk> I have an app that is based around jquery mobile and phonegap.  I am using JSON to deliver dynamic data to HTML,  I am wondering if anyone can recommend a good article/tutorial in the best practices of securing that JSON call to the app, some sorta hash key
[14:38:39] <nerk> ?
[14:39:14] <nerk> as it stands, the JSON call is a free for all, if you can expose the call that is made.
[14:39:26] <yedi> 'input:checkbox' is the selector for all checkboxes, but what would the selector be for all checkboxes with the class 'a-class'
[14:39:52] <nerk> input.a-class:checkbox
[14:40:04] <systemfault> Damn jQuery-ism...
[14:40:05] <yedi> thanks
[14:40:25] <yedi> oh wait
[14:40:33] <yedi> that's not what i wanted to ask sorry,
[14:40:47] <yedi> what would it be to select it by name, not class
[14:40:51] <systemfault> Slower selectors just for the sake of typing 7 characters less
[14:41:04] <nerk> input[name=name]:checkbox
[14:41:10] <yedi> ok cool
[14:41:12] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm trying to preload some images that I am using in a slider. http://pastebin.com/sULKaF3j
[14:41:15] <sunbeam> However, for some reason the images are still not properly preloaded (when I open the site, the images only loads 50% ) the slider
[14:41:16] <systemfault> That's dumb to do though
[14:41:18] <sunbeam> Any idea what I can try
[14:41:22] <systemfault> (Selecting by name)
[14:41:27] <nerk> agree
[14:41:42] <nerk> it is a slower selector
[14:42:07] <systemfault> Not just that... names can change depending on the needs of the backend dev.
[14:42:59] <nerk> if you need to get a unique dom element.. then give it an id
[14:43:01] <nerk> and select it via id
[14:43:15] <nerk> if you need to get a group of elements by selector, then do it via class
[14:43:22] <nerk> giving them a class
[14:43:23] <systemfault> nerk++
[14:43:25] <nerk> always the best way to go
[14:43:34] <nerk> those attributes exist for that reason
[14:45:04] <nerk> now if I could find the best pratices for securing a json call to my app, I'd be a happy camper?
[14:45:11] <nerk> yes, i would :)
[14:45:58] <coldhead> encrypted JSON over https on a VPN
[14:46:02] <Caelum> how do you select any type of element by name? $('*[name=foo]') ?
[14:46:08] <r--> LOLOLOL OMGZ
[14:46:11] <r--> LOOOOOOOOOL!
[14:46:15] <nerk> coldhead: it's a mobile app, phonegap.
[14:46:17] <r--> ya'll see that guy kickin them boxes over there?
[14:46:53] <nerk> moreover, I need some sort of hash key that validates it via get param, I believe.
[14:47:32] <nerk> just trying to figure out the best salty key to store/use. as it needs to update frequently ( to invalidate the call for sniffers )
[14:47:57] <nerk> maybe a combination of internal key, set via config, timestamp and my salty bit
[14:48:10] <coldhead> that sounds like a rich salt
[14:48:24] <nerk> sounds like it has flaws
[14:48:44] <xsamurai> How would I tie two elements to two different events but use the same function http://jsfiddle.net/JaXGe/
[14:49:01] <nerk> if by the hour::minute, what happens when the clock has rolled over but the hash key has the previous minute.
[14:49:12] <nerk> the call fails :/
[14:49:16] <r--> ya'll see that guy kickin them boxes over there?
[14:49:50] <coldhead> what are you going on about r--
[14:50:03] <JessC> @xsamurai create a named function instead of passing an anonymous one
[14:50:34] <r--> coldhead: you got some kind of problem?
[14:50:34] <xsamurai> JessC: thanks
[14:50:48] <coldhead> many r-- but none in relation to you
[14:50:50] <coldhead> so far
[14:51:02] <coldhead> i'm just wondering about the box kicking
[14:51:02] <r--> 15:49 < coldhead> what are you going on about r--
[14:51:13] <r--> oh lol
[14:51:14] <r--> well
[14:51:20] <r--> there's a dude kickin them boxes over ther
[14:51:36] <coldhead> ah, thank you for clarifying
[14:51:45] <coldhead> i have no further questions at this time
[14:51:48] <coldhead> case dismissed
[14:51:49] <r--> HEY MAN NO PROBLEM BROHAM

[14:52:20] <sunbeam> However, for some reason the images are still not properly preloaded (when I open the site, the images only loads 50% )
[14:52:26] <sunbeam> what can i best do about this
[14:52:30] <JessC> @xsamurai http://jsfiddle.net/JaXGe/1/ fyi, live is deprecated, use "on" instead.
[14:52:46] <nerk> i can have my app set a session on the json server when it loads.. then just check that SID
[14:52:48] <nerk> that'll work
[14:53:08] <nerk> thanks for listening to me solve my own problem. lol
[14:53:34] <coachz> hi guys
[14:55:43] <HyShai> When i use JSLint on jsfiddle, it's valid; but on jslint.com it has a syntax error, what's up? http://jsfiddle.net/WyzAy/3/
[14:56:06] <coachz> Anyone got a sec to check out my code ?  I'm trying to get Gridster to work but I can't get it to allow me to drag and drop.   http://pastebin.com/A84at0zg
[14:56:35] <bil`> does query or plain JS have any number formatting methods?
[14:58:35] <JessC> @bil` what do you mean?
[14:59:40] <bil`> JessC: like if i have a string "10000" i can sun some method on it to add comma and make it "10,000"
[14:59:44] <bil`> sun=run
[15:00:52] <coldhead> ?w sun-ra
[15:00:54] <bot-t> coldhead, Sun Ra - Sun Ra (born Herman Poole Blount, legal name Le Sony'r Ra; May 22, 1914 â May 30, 1993) was a prolific jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, poet and philosopher known for his "cosmic philosophy," musical compositions and performances. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra

[15:01:26] <JessC> that's about the only one i can think of that are native
[15:01:46] <JessC> you'd have to write your own otherwise
[15:02:47] <wachpwnski> hey im using google apis, but for some reason I have to use document.getElementById, and I can't pass in a selector from jquery. Any suggestions?
[15:03:14] <aniasis> are you able to get the height width of an image after you've created it?

[15:04:34] <socialhapy> â Issue #82 on gridster.js (coachz; 1m, 8s ago): no draggable grid displayed
[15:06:29] <nerk> bil`:  phpjs has some nifty number formatting methods that have been designed to work like PHP, if you were looking for something more like that
[15:06:39] <nerk> http://phpjs.org/functions/number_format/
[15:06:58] <systemfault> Oh my...
[15:07:18] <nerk> not really sure how well it performs really
[15:07:18] <systemfault> Another stupid idea... phpjs.
[15:07:46] <nerk> agreed, I have my digit decorated before it gets delivered to js for templating
[15:07:52] <snover> worst of php + worst of javascript = phpjs
[15:07:54] <bil`> prob a bit too heavy. I'm sure theres some lightweight libraries just for what i need out there
[15:07:55] <systemfault> Javascript doesn't need the inconsistencies of the PHP standard lib :/
[15:08:19] <bil`> or a jq plugin
[15:08:43] <nerk> bil`: where is the raw digit coming from that you want to format?
[15:09:04] <bil`> a backend api
[15:09:18] <nerk> do you have control over the api?
[15:09:24] <bil`> no biggie, it was really curiosity more than anything to see if anything was native
[15:10:03] <bil`> yea but i rather keep it as an integer in the api
[15:10:05] <bil`>     function formatCommas(x) {
[15:10:05] <bil`>         return x.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ",");
[15:10:06] <bil`>     }
[15:10:28] <bil`> bam.. stack overflow for the win :)
[15:11:59] <JessC> you could write a function on the number prototype
[15:12:23] <JessC> that would then give you the ability to call the format function like number format
[15:13:32] <JessC> @bil` http://phpjs.org/functions/number_format/
[15:20:01] <aniasis> any jquery tool to filter lewd images?
[15:21:20] <aettinger> aniasis: lewd images?
[15:21:26] <aniasis> like porn
[15:21:28] <aettinger> but those are the best ones
[15:21:34] <aniasis> yeah I know
[15:21:42] <aniasis> that's why I want to filter for them
[15:21:43] <aettinger> i don't think javascript can deduce if your image is porn or not
[15:21:48] <aettinger> heh
[15:21:57] <aniasis> any 3rd part services that do so?
[15:22:07] <aettinger> sure
[15:22:11] <aettinger> lots i'm sure
[15:22:25] <aettinger> i know schools filter that stuff at the firewall
[15:23:16] <JessC> check the url for the image
[15:23:23] <JessC> and block it based on that?
[15:23:46] <aettinger> look up web content filter api
[15:24:03] <JessC> schools and companies that filter for porn look for known adult sites or use a proxy to check the data before it gets sent to you
[15:24:06] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm trying to preload some images that I am using in a slider. http://pastebin.com/YBwkAJxv
[15:24:10] <sunbeam> However, for some reason the images are still not properly preloaded (when I open the site, the images only loads 50% )
[15:24:14] <sunbeam> what can i best do about this
[15:24:33] <systemfault> aettinger: nude.js ?:P
[15:24:40] <aettinger> systemfault: heh
[15:25:00] <aettinger> sunbeam: jsfiddle?
[15:25:33] <aettinger> sunbeam: var img = new Image();
[15:25:38] <aettinger> img.src = '/path/to/png';
[15:25:43] <aettinger> that's all you need
[15:26:15] <aniasis> I just want something that if I pass it an image url it will tell me if it is SFW
[15:26:48] <aettinger> aniasis: i wonder if google has an api for that
[15:27:18] <aettinger> https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/
[15:27:35] <aettinger> https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/lookup_guide
[15:27:59] <aettinger> https://sb-ssl.google.com/safebrowsing/api/lookup?client=demo-app&apikey=12345&appver=1.5.2&pver=3.0&url=http%3A%2F%2Fianfette.org%2F
[15:29:01] <aettinger> their example url doesn't work
[15:29:14] <aettinger> i guess you need a real qpi key
[15:29:42] <wachpwnski> how do you catch certain certain http codes with the $.ajax({}); function?
[15:29:53] <sunbeam> aettinger: thakns
[15:30:35] <aniasis> aettinger, yeah I was looking at that
[15:31:04] <aettinger> wachpwnski: inspect the xhr in the response
[15:31:21] <aettinger> .complete(xhr, data){ console.log(xhr.code) }
[15:31:25] <aettinger> (i think)
[15:31:47] <aettinger> sorry, .complete(function(xhr, data) { }
[15:33:05] <JessC> complete will only fire on 2xx codes
[15:33:05] <aettinger> actually, that is deprecated
[15:33:06] <aettinger> .done()
[15:33:14] <ShaunR> does .load buffer the output or hold the output until the page is done loading?
[15:33:18] <aettinger> .done() fires all all iirc
[15:33:47] <aettinger> JessC: i think you're referring to .success
[15:33:54] <aettinger> http://pastie.org/5385023
[15:33:59] <JessC> that one too yes
[15:34:21] <aettinger> .complete should fire on 404
[15:34:39] <aettinger> but i'm not sure how you get the code
[15:35:15] <JessC> aettinger: i was thinking of the option you can set inside the ajax function (which is not as good as using the deferred object)
[15:36:41] <aettinger> wachpwnski: http://pastie.org/5385023
[15:38:38] <aniasis> aettinger, yeah that's only for sites that have malware.
[15:38:58] <aettinger> is that the only response type?
[15:39:31] <TelFiRE> Curious... for most simple stuff that uses largely just selectors and animate() calls, and like slideToggle... would I be able to just load jqMobi instead of jQuery on mobile, and use the same script files?
[15:40:46] <wachpwnski> aettinger:  cool
[15:40:54] <aettinger> aniasis: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/713247/what-is-the-best-way-to-programatically-detect-porn-images
[15:40:56] <wachpwnski> i know error will throw on 4xx
[15:42:24] <ShaunR> i need to use somthing like load() but want the output to be immediately inserted into the page (not wait for it to complete).  What would i use?
[15:44:52] <aettinger> ShaunR: how would you insert something that hasn't come back yet?
[15:45:16] <ShaunR> i'm wanting to insert it as it comes in
[15:45:23] <ShaunR> not wait for it to complete first
[15:45:25] <aettinger> oh, like a stream
[15:45:27] <ShaunR> yep
[15:45:34] <aettinger> eventStream maybe?
[15:45:40] <aettinger> you could use server send events
[15:46:11] <aettinger> stream.on('foo', function(){});  server pushes foo: data
[15:46:45] <aettinger> i don't think you can do it with standard .ajax
[15:47:16] <aettinger> https://github.com/chovy/nodejs-stream/blob/master/static/main.js
[15:51:52] <wachpwnski> how can I break out of an ajax call?
[15:52:03] <wachpwnski> i am catching 204, but still success: is also executing.
[15:52:37] <systemfault> Break out?
[15:52:42] <systemfault> Like... aborting?
[15:52:43] <coachz> you using,  .ajax ?
[15:53:05] <coachz> you can set a timeout but it sounds like you are getting a response
[15:53:05] <wachpwnski> yes
[15:53:19] <wachpwnski> It's not catching my 204
[15:53:33] <wachpwnski> it's just accepting it as sucessful.
[15:53:36] <systemfault> 204 is successful...
[15:53:43] <systemfault> Any 2xx is successful
[15:53:50] <aettinger> wachpwnski: don't use .succes, use .complete
[15:53:58] <aettinger> and check the code there
[15:54:23] <coachz> systemfault,  have you got 5 mins to try Gridster to maybe find out why mine isn't working?  http://gridster.net/   https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js/issues/82

[15:54:40] <coachz> i even downloaded their demo page and tried to build it
[15:55:55] <systemfault> I suck at drag&dropping... I don't have much experience with that.
[15:56:07] <coachz> but are you bored :-)
[15:56:23] <systemfault> I'm still at work :(
[15:56:30] <coachz> so that's a YES
[15:56:31] <coachz> hehe
[15:56:34] <systemfault> :)
[15:56:42] <coachz> oh well
[15:56:46] <coachz> i'm stuck
[16:05:46] <wachpwnski> if you have an object like $(this).child('.class')
[16:05:48] <wachpwnski> does taht work
[16:06:36] <coachz> umm let me check my notes
[16:06:42] <coachz> you're trying to do what
[16:07:29] <coachz> return the element that is a child of an element with class "foo" ?
[16:07:45] <wachpwnski> I just want to select the first child element of something
[16:07:57] <wachpwnski> i do like var mdiv = $(this)
[16:08:21] <wachpwnski> I think mdiv.children('.child') works, but is it optimal?
[16:09:08] <coachz> $('p:first')
[16:09:15] <coachz> use the pseudo selector
[16:09:46] <coachz> that selects the FIRST of a set of elements
[16:09:57] <systemfault> Probably that mdiv.children().eq(0) works also
[16:10:04] <deanclkclk> folks..good day
[16:10:17] <deanclkclk> why this shit doesn't work $("div:not(.navbar)")
[16:10:28] <deanclkclk> it still selects it as a deep child
[16:10:34] <deanclkclk> I still see it shows up
[16:10:36] <deanclkclk> any ideas?
[16:10:54] <systemfault> How is that navbar element declared?
[16:11:10] <systemfault> (in the html)
[16:14:03] <deanclkclk> systemfault: http://pastie.org/5385277
[16:14:07] <deanclkclk> right there
[16:14:16] <deanclkclk> u can see the div class="navbar"
[16:16:33] <systemfault> Works here http://jsfiddle.net/qgwEf/
[16:16:43] <systemfault> Even if that selector is a bad joke
[16:18:34] <Foxhoundz> is it possible to change the date separator character in jQuery UI's datepicker() plugin?
[16:18:48] <Foxhoundz> i.e., change mm/dd/yyyy to mm-dd-yyy
[16:19:19] <Foxhoundz> I could do it via a callback function once the date is picked and change the value manually, but I was hoping there would be built in option to do it
[16:19:31] <mdedetrich> I have an issue with jquery ui
[16:19:47] <mdedetrich> when using dialog, I use it as a modal dialog which gets positioned in the center of the screen
[16:20:14] <mdedetrich> the issue is that for certain widths, it causes the 'left' attribute of the dialog to be a value that is not a whole number (i.e. something.5)
[16:20:23] <mdedetrich> this causes the borders to dissapear
[16:20:38] <mdedetrich> when it happens, is there an easy way to fix this/
[16:26:17] <cobalt238_> With jstree, I'm calling .search() on the variable returned from jstree(), but it says that method isn't found even though I have the plugin enabled
[16:26:46] <cobalt238_> Is there something else I have to do to enable that plugin besides including it into the "plugins" array?

[16:31:38] <HyShai> i'm having conflicting results w/ jsfiddle's jslint and jslint.com
[16:38:27] <deanclkclk> systemfault: doesn't work here http://jsfiddle.net/qgwEf/1/
[16:39:03] <systemfault> deanclkclk: it works... it selects 14 instead of 15
[16:39:22] <deanclkclk> yeah but, I don't wanna it select any .navbar
[16:39:37] <wachpwnski> can you do a key value dict to execute functions based on id?
[16:39:41] <deanclkclk> ahh I see what u mean
[16:39:42] <deanclkclk> sorry
[16:39:56] <systemfault> deanclkclk: Then you can't
[16:40:04] <wachpwnski> Or do I have to use a switch case?
[16:40:49] <systemfault> wachpwnski: if you know on what object is the function, you could do: myObject[id]();
[16:41:32] <deanclkclk> all I can tell u systemfault it doesn't work...cuss when I run this query..I can see a div with .navbar as a deep parent
[16:41:47] <wachpwnski> systemfault:  can you give me an example
[16:42:07] <systemfault> deanclkclk: That query selects all divs except the one with that class
[16:42:20] <systemfault> deanclkclk: it selects divs that are children of .navbar
[16:42:33] <deanclkclk> well I am seeing the same one with div class="navbar"
[16:44:23] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/qgwEf/4/ See the box with the blue border? it's the navbar. If it was selected, that border would be red like the others instead
[16:47:16] <raj> if I set `$(document).on('click', '.some-parent>.some-el', function(){})`, is unbinding via `$('.some-parent>some-el').unbind()` valid? or does it have to mention `document`?
[16:48:43] <systemfault> raj: afaik, you would use .off with the same think that you used for .on
[16:49:01] <systemfault> s/think/thing
[16:49:57] <raj> systemfault, I'm aware that works, but I have multiple bindings on each element, and I need all events removed
[16:50:10] <raj> and some things are bound different ways
[16:50:20] <raj> so just to sweep it all out, I was using unbind()
[17:02:13] <raj> systemfault, seems you must unbind the parent object that you ran the method `.on` on http://jsfiddle.net/zHJqK/
[17:02:22] <raj> can't just choose the selector
[17:02:33] <deanclkclk> systemfault: I think I know what the problem is
[17:03:12] <deanclkclk> I have a click event on the parent div that I select ...which contains a div I don't want to select
[17:03:24] <deanclkclk> so when I click navbar...the event still gets triggered
[17:03:33] <deanclkclk> any idea how I could solve this problem?
[17:04:50] <wachpwnski> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Window] has no method 'init_geo_location'

[17:08:00] <kindtype> Hello there, I am curious how people feel about the DOM these days.
[17:08:32] <kindtype> A couple of years ago John Resig said "The DOM is a Mess"
[17:08:34] <kindtype> http://ejohn.org/blog/the-dom-is-a-mess/
[17:08:42] <kindtype> I am curious if people still feel that way
[17:08:52] <kindtype> and if there is anything more recent than 2009 on the topic
[17:11:40] <MistuhKurtz> 2009 is still fairly recent kindtype
[17:12:16] <MistuhKurtz> hmm, somebody should make a jquery version <--> date converter
[17:12:38] <MistuhKurtz> I have a better grasp of time & the browser landscape based on jquery versions than dates
[17:12:38] <MistuhKurtz> hahaha
[17:13:32] <kindtype> when you say that 2009 is recent, does that translate to "the DOM still sucks"?
[17:14:02] <kindtype> I am just not sure what frameworks like bootstrap and angular and others have done for the reputation of the DOM
[17:14:18] <kindtype> maybe I should just go ask there :)
[17:15:09] <delvinj> something more specific to go on might help
[17:15:58] <kindtype> I guess the real question is, do you find the DOM frustrating in 2012?
[17:16:08] <kindtype> IE is not as crappy these days
[17:16:21] <kindtype> lots of frameworks exist
[17:16:27] <kindtype> is it still a pain?
[17:16:31] <kindtype> in any way
[17:16:45] <kindtype> like if you want to center something vertically
[17:17:29] <delvinj> kindtype: like you want to put a tag in the exact middle of its siblings?
[17:17:37] <delvinj> just kidding.
[17:19:12] <kindtype> as in, you want to put a picture in the exact center of the screen
[17:20:50] <MistuhKurtz> kindtype, I don't have an opinion on whether the DOM sucks or not
[17:20:55] <MistuhKurtz> I just do what I'm told :P
[17:21:00] <kindtype> lol
[17:21:18] <delvinj> MistuhKurtz: form an opinion on the DOM
[17:21:22] <delvinj> :p
[17:21:51] <kindtype> I am thinking of doing a post about an alternative way of working with graphics on the web, so I am trying to get a feel for things that are perceived as a problem
[17:21:57] <kindtype> I know lots of things that I don't like
[17:22:07] <kindtype> But it helps if your reader is on the same page :)
[17:22:14] <MistuhKurtz> the Document Object Model is not the same as the "current browser landscape"
[17:22:39] <kindtype> can you clarify that
[17:22:47] <MistuhKurtz> Is the state of affairs better than it was in 2009? Yes, much better
[17:23:12] <kindtype> (finally Microsoft!)
[17:23:17] <MistuhKurtz> "The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents."
[17:24:03] <MistuhKurtz> that does not equate to browsers, new features, bugs, etc.
[17:25:05] <MistuhKurtz> I guess it would just be better if I watched John Resig's presentation you linked to kindtype, but I can't watch video atm.
[17:25:35] <kindtype> I guess my concern is that the DOM is bad for graphics, from the standpoint of semantics
[17:25:38] <kindtype> as in
[17:25:39] <MistuhKurtz> so it's browser support of the DOM that's a mess, not the DOM
[17:25:52] <kindtype> I see
[17:26:02] <kindtype> hmm
[17:26:06] <MistuhKurtz> and browsers have come a long ways since the issues he's talking about were a problem
[17:27:18] <kindtype> Hmmm, maybe the question should be broadened to HTML and CSS
[17:27:18] <MistuhKurtz> I'm not gonna sit and go through all the slides, but going off the first 20 I would say the answer to your question is "No, the DOM is not as much of a mess as it was in 2009"
[17:27:43] <kindtype> ok, thank you :) that makes sense
[17:28:05] <MistuhKurtz> well he's mostly talking about javascript/DOM support of browsers
[17:28:24] <kindtype> ok, side topic: so say you want elements to flow horizontally
[17:28:49] <kindtype> this is done by messing with attributes of each element rather than their container
[17:29:25] <kindtype> which is weird because flowing right has nothing to do with any particular element
[17:29:36] <kindtype> it only makes sense as a concept when there is a group of elements
[17:29:56] <MistuhKurtz> I disagree
[17:30:22] <kindtype> Let me clarify
[17:30:45] <MistuhKurtz> it sounds like the CSS3 Flexbox module might be of interest to you though
[17:31:06] <wachpwnski> http://jsfiddle.net/CU9bx/4/ how can I pass paramters into my foo and bar functions?
[17:31:32] <wachpwnski> I know i can call ktf[key](param); but how do i access them?
[17:32:17] <kindtype> interesting!
[17:34:02] <kindtype> here's the problem: if an element that flows down and an element that flows right meet, it is unclear what should happen
[17:34:17] <kindtype> if the "flow" is controlled by the container, there is no ambiguite
[17:34:20] <kindtype> ambiguity
[17:34:47] <kindtype> easy things are also really hard, like vertical centering
[17:35:08] <kindtype> rather, conceptually easy things
[17:35:41] <kindtype> and it is ugly
[17:35:51] <kindtype> it sounds like these things do not bother you?
[17:41:03] <MistuhKurtz> things certainly aren't perfect kindtype
[17:41:12] <MistuhKurtz> but you're welcome to engineer a superior solution ;)
[17:41:29] <kindtype> I think I did!
[17:42:14] <kindtype> I work on Elm that addresses a lot of these issues. I am just trying to figure out how to make people realize that semantics matter!
[17:42:30] <kindtype> "that" should be "which"
[17:47:10] <sunbeam> I'm trying to preload some images
[17:47:14] <sunbeam> but i really cannot get it to work
[17:47:31] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: how?
[17:47:46] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/ihE7Vg6N
[17:48:18] <sunbeam> http://pastebin.com/BnNC4MXW
[17:48:23] <sunbeam> that's what I use to init the slider
[17:48:44] <sunbeam> somehow every x times i refresh the browser the image first loaded only loads for like 10%
[17:49:02] <eddiemonge> is preloader visible? are the images in a hidden div? where is this code called?
[17:49:09] <sunbeam> preloader is hidden
[17:49:13] <sunbeam> yes
[17:49:56] <eddiemonge> then the images wont load
[17:51:28] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: have you tried http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-create-an-awesome-image-preloader/
[17:53:29] <sunbeam> dman those are quite some steps
[17:53:33] <sunbeam> ok ill read it
[17:53:39] <sunbeam> thx
[17:53:52] <MistuhKurtz> personally i like doing $('<img />').load(function(){ /* do my load event stuff */ }).attr('src', src);
[17:54:01] <eddiemonge> short answer is that you need #preloader to be visible
[17:54:35] <eddiemonge> MistuhKurtz: how will that preload the images?
[17:54:59] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: i don't get it, are they visible?
[17:55:26] <MistuhKurtz> just sharing a very quick snippet that gets around the problem of triggering the load event whether the image is actually loaded or cached. thought it might be relevant
[17:55:40] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: images need to be in a non-hidden div to load, usually. you can set the height to 1 (maybe 0) and/or positin it off screen
[17:55:46] <MistuhKurtz> I've used that technique in some preloading-type stuff before
[17:56:22] <MistuhKurtz> eddiemonge, then how come that snippet will reliably load an image even though the image object is detached from the DOM?
[17:57:30] <eddiemonge> will it?
[17:57:35] <sunbeam>  MistuhKurtz jQuery('<img>', {src: jQuery(this).attr('src')}).load(function() {
[17:57:37] <sunbeam> like this?
[18:00:21] <MistuhKurtz> eddiemonge, I loaded!
[18:00:23] <MistuhKurtz> whoops
[18:00:23] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[18:00:27] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/tYArp/
[18:00:30] <MistuhKurtz> copy paste fail
[18:01:02] <MistuhKurtz> no sunbeam, you need to define the load event handler before you define the image src
[18:01:11] <sunbeam> ahh sorry
[18:01:26] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: MistuhKurtz is right it works fine
[18:01:28] <sunbeam> sorry
[18:01:34] <MistuhKurtz> this is just a tiny little snippet of code, it's not a preloader. I was just very happy to find out about the technique and since you're dealing with loading images I thought you might appreciate it too
[18:02:31] <MistuhKurtz> not a full preloader script*
[18:03:26] <MistuhKurtz> you test it in all the browsers sunbeam ?
[18:03:38] <sunbeam> hmm
[18:03:44] <sunbeam> no it doesn't work everywhere
[18:04:07] <eddiemonge> MistuhKurtz: that doesnt preload images, it just loads the images in when they are done loading: http://jsfiddle.net/XjsT3/1/
[18:04:21] <JLT> http://pastebin.com/K5x2W8gE I'm using this, a textarea autosize script, and although it works fine - it doesn't work for future created textareas. How can I fix this?
[18:04:56] <JLT> Usually a Live would do the trick but ... not sure where I'd put it in this case. I did try replacing the bind on line 167 with the live ... but that didn't make any difference.
[18:05:08] <sunbeam> but somehow i need to set a delay before the first images shows MistuhKurtz eddiemonge
[18:05:16] <sunbeam> I can use something like setTimeOut
[18:05:33] <MistuhKurtz> eddiemonge, as I said it's not a full preloading script. Usually when i'm preloading stuff it's because I need to fire off an event handler once they load
[18:05:51] <MistuhKurtz> this takes care of that.
[18:06:27] <MistuhKurtz> sunbeam, then you can add the image to your document in your load handler, like in my example
[18:06:27] <eddiemonge> JLT: maybe add a listener for onmouseover to call $().autosize?
[18:07:14] <MistuhKurtz> sunbeam, if you're looping over an array of image srcs and you only want to show the image once the first 3, or once all of them have loaded, then you can use a deferred function to do that
[18:07:16] <eddiemonge> MistuhKurtz: preloading images is usually done in the case of things like drop down menus or sliders where the images should be loaded before they are displayed. so when you hover over a menu and it shows, the images dont load then
[18:09:10] <MistuhKurtz> eddiemonge, then it will absolutely work. you only saw the image loading because your code that appends it is chained immediately after the source is set. The image starts loading immediately before that, but the difference in time is negligible
[18:09:27] <MistuhKurtz> you could probably explore it further by setting some breakpoints
[18:09:57] <MistuhKurtz> but I only meant to share a quick snippet that's worked for me for image loading-related stuff in the past, not get roped into a conversation about it
[18:10:30] <coldhead> it's too late now
[18:10:32] <sunbeam> MistuhKurtz: how do you mean?
[18:10:46] <sunbeam> MistuhKurtz: i need to show all (12-15 etc images in the slider)
[18:10:56] <sunbeam> but its only important that the first one or first 3 are preloaded
[18:11:00] <MistuhKurtz> lol coldhead
[18:11:04] <sunbeam> but i try to display #preloader
[18:11:14] <sunbeam> and even then it doesnt work
[18:11:15] <MistuhKurtz> okay
[18:12:04] <JLT> eddiemonge: excellent, I had to modify the css but that method works great. Another thing I could do, everytime a textarea is created, I can call the autosize plugin again. It will not effect other textareas. Both methods work fine, however I think I'll stick with the mouseover :) tyvm
[18:12:33] <sunbeam> i really really never had this
[18:12:35] <ariel> does someone here know of the autocomplete sample
[18:12:36] <sunbeam> with sliders
[18:13:05] <MistuhKurtz> I would have an array of your image sources (whether defined as a JS array, or you construct the array from a collection of links pointing to the image, etc. just don't have them all there as <img /> tags because then they'll all start trying to download when you just want to download the first three, then lazy-load the rest
[18:13:38] <MistuhKurtz> loop through them and use a deferred that fires off once the first three have loaded
[18:13:43] <MistuhKurtz> this is all starting to get weird and experimental in my head
[18:13:43] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[18:14:03] <eddiemonge> MistuhKurtz: you may be right. looks like it does load it when called like that immediately.
[18:14:22] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: im beginning to suspect that you dont want to preload but rather show when loaded
[18:15:03] <eddiemonge> ariel: ?
[18:15:16] <MistuhKurtz> eddiemonge, yep, that's what I was going after anyways
[18:15:27] <MistuhKurtz> why preload when you can lazy-load?
[18:15:31] <ariel> eddiemonge: do you want the link
[18:16:23] <eddiemonge> ariel: no because you didnt ask a question
[18:16:40] <eddiemonge> MistuhKurtz: my point about when to preload is still valid though
[18:17:37] <ariel> it has todo with the autocomplete sample on the site its not working on my browser
[18:17:49] <eddiemonge> what browser? what site?
[18:18:16] <MistuhKurtz> I usually take care of that stuff by having my normal/hover/active states in the same background image
[18:18:16] <ariel> no site just browser i dont have a server yet
[18:19:56] <eddiemonge> MistuhKurtz: what about things like sliders/carousels? do you make one giant sprite?
[18:20:53] <MistuhKurtz> i make sprites for UI elements, not for content
[18:21:04] <eddiemonge> ariel: ?
[18:21:12] <MistuhKurtz> most of the time I do not engage in premature optimization
[18:21:37] <ariel> what are you confused about i told you already whats the problem it doesnt show in the browser
[18:23:08] <eddiemonge> ariel: not really. i dont know what you are talking about. you havent provided any code links
[18:23:52] <ariel> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[18:24:22] <ariel> i just changed some on the things in the code to reflect what im doing
[18:25:20] <eddiemonge> ariel: that page works for me
[18:26:05] <ariel> no i mean how i set it up can i show you in a private convo
[18:27:46] <eddiemonge> itll be better to just paste the link here
[18:28:31] <ariel> but its alot of code you really want to get into all that
[18:28:46] <eddiemonge> make a test case at jsfiddle

[18:29:18] <MistuhKurtz> sorry, the second one :)
[18:30:44] <wachpwnski> how do i determine the namespace a function is defined in?
[18:31:40] <MistuhKurtz> well, "this" refers to the object that owns that function wachpwnski, so you could try console.log(this);
[18:33:30] <jacobroufa> ping gnarf you around?
[18:34:09] <wachpwnski> MistuhKurtz:  now I get Window and line below says Infinity: Infinity
[18:34:24] <MistuhKurtz> lol really?
[18:34:36] <MistuhKurtz> maybe it's in the global namespace then wachpwnski ?
[18:34:41] <MistuhKurtz> or can that not be true
[18:34:50] <wachpwnski> well it's telling me
[18:35:14] <wachpwnski> Uncaught TypeError: Object function Window() { [native code] } has no method 'init_geo_location'
[18:35:47] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: what are you trying to do?
[18:36:15] <wachpwnski> eddiemonge:  I am going through all the divs with the class of autorqst
[18:36:30] <wachpwnski> and for each of those executing the function that is associated with the id
[18:38:05] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: function associated with id?
[18:38:14] <eddiemonge> that sounds like it could be trouble
[18:38:47] <wachpwnski> why do you say that?
[18:39:47] <eddiemonge> sounds like needless interdependencies
[18:39:53] <eddiemonge> can you give a code example?
[18:41:55] <wachpwnski> http://jsfiddle.net/CU9bx/8/
[18:42:00] <wachpwnski> eddiemonge:  there oyu go
[18:42:43] <wachpwnski> that is one of the many things I have tried
[18:43:15] <ariel> well it works in the ide is there a bug in the sample
[18:44:40] <wachpwnski> ariel: looks its not even calling the functions.
[18:45:47] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: thats not a good example. you are passing the return value from the functions as the object properties
[18:46:40] <eddiemonge> check the console
[18:46:59] <ariel> eddiemonge hmm http://jsfiddle.net/jAfyM/
[18:49:06] <eddiemonge> you dont believe in minimal test cases do you?
[18:52:03] <ariel> nop feel like i hit a brickwall cause im stuck

[18:57:49] <ariel> eddiemonge: so what could it be
[18:58:24] <eddiemonge> ariel: what do you mean? did you try debugging it? look at your console errors, take things away until it works .... etc?

[19:03:55] <a1g> anyone here use harvestapp for time tracking?
[19:13:41] <wachpwnski> eddiemonge:  can I do a switch case maybe?
[19:14:02] <eddiemonge> what is it you are trying to do?
[19:16:37] <wachpwnski> It's really simple I have a couple divs that are generated ad modules
[19:16:51] <wachpwnski> I want to initialize them according to a class name.
[19:17:03] <wachpwnski> and then according to the id
[19:17:38] <wachpwnski> so for each div with the class of autoload I want to initialize the div according to the id name that is associated with a function.
[19:18:56] <wachpwnski> So like <div id="foo" class="auto"></div>  Then for each div with the class of auto get the elements id and execute the proper initialization for that div according to a dictionary/key value pair of id to init function.
[19:20:05] <wachpwnski> if you have better suggestions, I am definitely open to them.
[19:22:09] <wachpwnski> I really just need to know why window[ 'init_geo_location' ](module); wont work.
[19:22:52] <eddiemonge> why dont you just do just bind to the id?
[19:23:14] <wachpwnski> because there are times the modules will be auto loaded, and times they will not
[19:24:03] <wachpwnski> So if it is auto the listener will on load init them all, if not then it will have a different bind according to that.
[19:24:41] <wachpwnski> I might be talking crazy right now. So don't be confused too much.
[19:24:54] <eddiemonge> why not var autoload = $('.autoload'); autoload.filter("#id").yourFunction()?
[19:25:37] <wachpwnski> Let me post my code for you really quick
[19:26:44] <wachpwnski> https://gist.github.com/3be3939f6f814a0d0042 line 6 is where things are getting goofy.
[19:26:47] <wachpwnski> 16*
[19:27:19] <wachpwnski> I think I just need to find the namespace of my functions on line 30 and 50
[19:28:40] <wachpwnski> I think your code might work though
[19:31:40] <wachpwnski> eddiemonge:  when you say .yourFunction() how do you define that?
[19:34:55] <eddiemonge> one sec
[19:39:17] <coldhead> http://windows95tips.tumblr.com/post/34207644858
[19:40:20] <wachpwnski> I got it with .each(function() {}
[19:41:43] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: if you are expecting json back from the server, why do you set dataType to html?
[19:42:56] <wachpwnski> eddiemonge:  that is because my api is still in dev
[19:43:05] <wachpwnski> If I return as json my browser will download it
[19:43:28] <eddiemonge> ?
[19:53:45] <wachpwnski> eddiemonge:  not important, i think i hav eit
[19:54:04] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take five
[19:54:52] <wachpwnski> by take five, do you mean drugs and heroine?
[19:55:16] <coldhead> that's a matter for yourself
[19:57:12] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: i think this is slightly better: http://jsbin.com/welcome/49618/edit
[19:58:48] <eddiemonge> http://jsbin.com/welcome/49618/
[19:59:08] <coldhead> woah that looks hard
[19:59:50] <eddiemonge> whoops that isnt even done
[20:00:04] <tw2113> that's what she said coldhead
[20:01:10] <coldhead> not to me she didn't
[20:01:59] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: ok thats better
[20:05:42] <eddiemonge> or not
[20:07:16] <wachpwnski> id is mesed up
[20:07:28] <wachpwnski>                         opts.module.id.action,
[20:08:16] <eddiemonge> it should be opts[module.id].action
[20:08:38] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[20:08:47] <eddiemonge> i agree coldhead
[20:08:57] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: its an example. not meant to be perfect
[20:09:03] <eddiemonge> showing a different way of doing it
[20:11:10] <wachpwnski> Oddly its not updating the stuff now :/
[20:13:42] <coldhead> WE'VE TAKEN THIS LONG SO WHY SO STARRY EYED
[20:14:29] <WebDragon> is something like this going to work as one would expect, or am I DoingItWrongâ¢ ? if (menuwidth < navwidth && ( $("#navbar li").css{"float"} != 'none' ) ) {
[20:14:40] <WebDragon> oops
[20:14:47] <WebDragon> css("float") not {}
[20:16:01] <coldhead> that looks okay, WebDragon
[20:19:53] <WebDragon> damn, still doing it wrong. something else is screwing with me
[20:20:48] <coldhead> WebDragon: i would split up up into vars
[20:21:01] <coldhead> like
[20:21:42] <coldhead> var too_thin = menuwidth < navwidth; var floated = $("#navbar li").css{"float"} != 'none';
[20:21:52] <coldhead> if (too_thin && floated)
[20:22:03] <coldhead> then you can log them out and see which is which
[20:22:16] <WebDragon> basically I've got a thinko in msc.local.js that's affecting the navbar when you transition to portrait from landscape tablet mode (or just size a browser that small)
[20:22:26] <coldhead> um
[20:22:30] <coldhead> no wonder
[20:22:37] <coldhead> that sounds very gomblex
[20:22:40] <coldhead> i need asprin
[20:22:40] <WebDragon> not really
[20:22:46] <WebDragon> www.mainstreetcourt.com
[20:22:49] <coldhead> it's too gomblex for me!
[20:23:10] <coldhead> WebDragon: aren't you supposed to handle orientation changes in CSS with media queries?
[20:23:14] <WebDragon> just grab a corner and size it down til the navbar turns into buttons. voila, home gets jogged over due to it still being applied
[20:23:15] <coldhead> that's what i was told anyway
[20:23:45] <WebDragon> yeah mostly, but I WAS using jquery to center the nav itself within the FULL full width navbar wrapper so it centers properly
[20:23:56] <WebDragon> I can live with it not centering if js is disabled but otherwise want it
[20:24:33] <WebDragon> couldn't figure out a nice way to do the math in the css that would guarantee centering at various browser widths up until you get to the smaller sizes where it's not needed
[20:24:44] <coldhead> aye
[20:24:59] <coldhead> so i am seeing a margin-left for Home
[20:25:02] <coldhead> and not for the others
[20:25:23] <WebDragon> yup, and it ONLY appears when you TRANSITION. if you load the page that way it's fine
[20:26:02] <WebDragon> not a browser bug at all, just a thinko in my jquery I forgot to account for
[20:26:05] <coldhead> harsh
[20:26:43] <coldhead> so it's this line, right? $("#navbar li:first-child").css({"margin-left": offset +"px"});
[20:26:48] <coldhead> i don't see why you have that
[20:27:32] <WebDragon> if you disable that piece of script, the Navbar (at wide screen) while full width, will not center the nav buttons within it below the large homepage image. they're flush left to the container
[20:27:42] <coldhead> WebDragon: i would set a class when that treshold is met and they go to vertical button layout
[20:27:51] <coldhead> like $('body').addClass('narrow')
[20:27:57] <coldhead> and use that for my logic
[20:28:05] <coldhead> rather than measuring repeatedly
[20:28:09] <WebDragon> how do you get jquery to sense the media query that would pull that off ?
[20:28:19] <coldhead> you can't
[20:28:26] <coldhead> i'd add the class with jQuery
[20:28:42] <WebDragon> so you'd add the class with jquery under what conditions, exactly?
[20:28:45] <WebDragon> :)
[20:28:48] <WebDragon> *cough*
[20:28:57] <coldhead> at the point when you change the layout
[20:29:01] <coldhead> to vertical
[20:29:03] * WebDragon waits for coldhead to get that far away look
[20:29:10] <coldhead> i would addClass('narrow')
[20:29:14] <WebDragon> the layout change to vertical is done entirely in the css
[20:29:16] <coldhead> then if i had any narrow stuff in my css
[20:29:24] <coldhead> it would be .narrow nav {whatever}
[20:29:27] <coldhead> and in my jQ
[20:29:30] <WebDragon> how do I get jquery to detect the layout change to vertical so I can add the class? :O)
[20:29:31] <coldhead> i would be
[20:29:42] <coldhead> if ($('body').is('.narrow'))
[20:29:52] <coldhead> sorry
[20:30:02] <coldhead> i am not saying move the width detection to css
[20:30:09] <coldhead> you still want to do it in jQuery
[20:30:16] <coldhead> but i would have that ADD the class
[20:30:28] <coldhead> if (too_narrow) $('body').addClass('narrow');
[20:30:38] <coldhead> then use that class in my css AND my jQuery
[20:30:41] <coldhead> to handle the narrow stuff
[20:30:55] <coldhead> ignore me if you don't know what i mean
[20:30:59] <coldhead> i'm not sure i know
[20:31:00] <WebDragon> I was just trying to get it to detect when the li's are no longer floated
[20:31:11] <coldhead> and that's a CSS change?
[20:31:24] <WebDragon> yep, but one the dom would be aware of and queryable with jquery
[20:32:02] <WebDragon> though I see why this isn't changing. it's only running this once, not at resize
[20:32:12] <coldhead> a ha
[20:32:24] <WebDragon> ok there's some avenue of exploration
[20:32:27] <WebDragon> cheers :D
[20:32:38] <WebDragon> time to go have a beer, now I know what to work on tomorrow
[20:32:47] <WebDragon> 11:32pm is way too late to still be working
[20:32:58] <WebDragon> ... but it was nagging at my brain :D
[20:33:06] <WebDragon> *tips hat*
[20:33:06] <aqeel> hi room
[20:33:17] <coldhead> happy trails, WD
[20:33:44] <raj> holy smokes, jqui 1.9 is out?
[20:33:49] <raj> when did this happen?
[20:34:17] <coldhead> BinaryKitten: i showed that mind bending deferred code of yours to @angustweets and he said he's going to use it in a talk soon. probably without attribution but still <3
[20:34:21] <raj> also, will it break all my tabs?
[20:34:42] <coldhead> bot-t: will the new jQuery UI break raj's tabs?
[20:34:43] <bot-t> coldhead, It is decidedly so.
[20:34:47] <coldhead> sorry raj
[20:34:53] <coldhead> if it were up to me...
[20:34:55] <coldhead> but it isn't
[20:34:56] <raj> shake it again?
[20:34:59] <coldhead> nothing is up to me
[20:35:07] <aqeel> should i use window.load or window.ajaxStop...
[20:35:09] <coldhead> shaking again just makes the fates angry
[20:35:20] <coldhead> they do different things, aqeel
[20:35:26] <coldhead> you should use the right one for your needs
[20:35:29] <raj> bot-t: will it make it worse?
[20:35:29] <bot-t> raj, Concentrate and ask again.
[20:35:45] <raj> bot-t: Will things be worse?
[20:35:45] <bot-t> raj, It is certain.
[20:35:50] <raj> oh god
[20:35:50] <aqeel> i want to stop the spinner after the contetns loaded
[20:35:58] <coldhead> bot-t: are the fates truly furious now?
[20:35:58] <bot-t> coldhead, Signs point to yes.
[20:36:04] <coldhead> i know, they surely do
[20:36:22] <coldhead> are you loading the content with ajax, aqeel?
[20:36:24] <raj> i wish I had milk for these brownies
[20:36:32] <aqeel> yes
[20:36:36] <raj> bot-t, will there be a place that will deliver milk online?
[20:36:36] <bot-t> raj, Don't count on it.
[20:36:36] <coldhead> then ajaxStop
[20:36:41] <coldhead> window.load will have fired long ago
[20:36:42] <raj> you pessimistic sob
[20:37:02] <aqeel> thanks
[20:39:18] <coldhead> ask better questions, aqeel
[20:39:44] <coldhead> "i am loading content via ajax and would like to make a spinner disappear when it stops. which event should i bind to"
[20:40:43] <aqeel> ok
[20:40:48] <aqeel> thanks for clarification
[20:41:11] <coldhead> you are very welcome aqeel. good luck
[20:41:25] <coldhead> you little cutie
[20:41:36] <aqeel> you remember me
[20:41:47] <aqeel> ;)
[20:42:02] <coldhead> i remember all my #jQuery friends
[20:43:48] <raj> does jqui's `dialog` need an 'options' argument before an object containing the different options?
[20:45:30] <coldhead> god only knows
[20:45:38] <raj> yes, it does
[20:45:42] <raj> just found it
[20:47:19] <coldhead> sup god
[21:08:25] <Erika_Mustermann> Is there a plugin to give a site social bookmark functionality, ie. the ability to tag links and view links by tags?
[21:12:32] <aqeel> http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-social-bookmark-plugins/
[21:16:06] <Erika_Mustermann> aqeel: I don't want to use a social bookmark site.  Sorry, if I wasn't clear.
[21:16:41] <Erika_Mustermann> I'd like the ability to tag links and then display links by their tags/catergories.
[21:16:47] <Erika_Mustermann> For a links page
[21:17:38] <raj> can I add a default button on the titlebar for jquery-ui dialog? so I don't have to be explicit each time i create a dialog?
[21:19:50] <aqeel> might help
[21:19:52] <aqeel> http://xoxco.com/projects/code/tagsinput/
[21:20:12] <Erika_Mustermann> Thannks, aqeel.
[21:20:32] <Erika_Mustermann> I'll check it out.
[21:23:16] <aqeel> raj not clear, please clarify your question
[21:24:48] <raj> jquery-ui has a `dialog` widget. In the dialog box created by that widget, a titlebar sits at the top. In that titlebar, there is an X to close the dialog. That X shows up in each dialog without having to explicitly create it. I would like to add an additional button that will be there by default, next to the X
[21:26:09] <aqeel> well had to hard code into the widget or simply wrap into div and have it explicitly positioned
[21:27:47] <aqeel> create a wrapper div in which your dialog pops and within that div create the extra button , give it z-index 5 or more thus to stay on top and have it explicitly positioned
[21:29:52] <raj> aqeel, that seems like a fix, but not so clean
[21:29:55] <raj> can i extend the widgeT?
[21:30:06] <aqeel> you might contact the owner or creator of the widget to help you with extra bit
[21:30:23] <aqeel> well you can if you know what is going on within the widget code
[21:31:16] <shesek> (completely offtopic) Can someone help me out? I'm developing something that uses the Twitter API to read direct messages; The problem is that I have no direct messages to test it with :) Can someone send me one? (I'll need to follow you first, PM me your username)
[21:32:07] <aqeel> you do not have your own twitter account
[21:32:51] <shesek> I do (just opened one, never used twitter), but I don't have any direct messages sent to me (obviously, considering that I just opened it)
[21:33:01] <aqeel> i c
[21:33:22] <aqeel> well good luck with your new line of twitter follow ups
[21:33:38] <aqeel> i do actually every third day
[21:33:53] <shesek> care to send me one?
[21:33:55] <aqeel> followed the jailbreak community and repo communities
[21:34:11] <shesek> I just need to make sure my API calls are working properly, kinda hard with no data to test it with
[21:38:13] <Erika_Mustermann> aqeel: Thanks for the link, but I'm looking to sort content by pre-defined tags--not allow users to add tags to links.
[21:38:58] <aqeel> ok, googling
[21:42:11] <aqeel> http://jquery.webspirited.com/2011/02/jquery-tagit-a-jquery-tagging-plugin/
[21:42:37] <Erika_Mustermann> Thanks, checking it out.
[21:42:41] <aqeel> Ability to provide initial tags on creation though options
[21:42:43] <aqeel> Ability to provide initial tags on creation via list items
[21:48:30] <raj> is $(document).on('click', '.someelement') any slower than $('.somelement').on('click') ?
[21:49:29] <coldhead> the first one probably initialises slightly faster
[21:49:41] <coldhead> because it doesn't have to search for $('.some-elem')
[21:49:48] <coldhead> but they should run at the same speed when there is a click
[21:49:53] <coldhead> they'll be the same internally
[21:57:48] <coldhead> i'm glad we had this chat
[21:57:58] <coldhead> alright great job everyone, let's leave it here for the day
[21:58:14] <raj> wow
[21:58:30] <raj> interesting
[21:58:44] <raj> can't believe you could break it down like that
[22:00:25] <coldhead> crazy times
[22:00:39] <coldhead> my window manager just crashed
[22:04:22] <raj> coldhead, you know what's wonderful about that?
[22:04:50] <raj> I can just bind everything to $(document).on('click', '.selector') and then do $(document).undbind() and I'm home free
[22:05:04] <coldhead> i think you're supposed to use off()
[22:05:07] <coldhead> with on()
[22:05:09] <coldhead> for symmetry
[22:05:25] <raj> yeah, but then I have to restate each selector within off, no?
[22:05:57] <scalex000> why this JSON.parse: unexpected character
[22:05:59] <scalex000> http://172.35.1.200/scripts/jquery-1.8.0.js
[22:06:00] <scalex000> Line 514
[22:06:12] <coldhead> i don't know, raj, i still use live() and die()
[22:06:14] <coldhead> like a caveman
[22:07:01] <raj> omg, that's exactly what I should have been doing
[22:07:23] <coldhead> scalex000: firstly if that's a problem with your data we won't be able to work it out looking at the source to jquery
[22:07:41] <coldhead> secondly that IP address is not accessible to the world
[22:08:00] <coldhead> 56 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 55184ms
[22:08:19] <scalex000> yes, I know but this code work on another server, but in my local webserver no
[22:09:37] <scalex000> coldhead, why the same code not work on 2 different webserver
[22:10:02] <coldhead> ?jsonlint @ scalex000
[22:10:02] <bot-t> scalex000, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[22:10:08] <coldhead> make sure your JSON is valid there
[22:11:02] <scalex000> coldhead, do you believe I need to install something more
[22:11:09] <coldhead> i have no idea
[22:11:21] <coldhead> if you are getting a json error you should paste your JSON into that website
[22:11:28] <coldhead> and it will tell you to to fix
[22:11:32] <coldhead> how to fix*
[22:11:44] <scalex000> http://enviosboya.com.do/form_login/callcenter.php
[22:11:47] <scalex000> go there
[22:11:50] <scalex000> work fine
[22:12:02] <scalex000> but in my internal webserver nop
[22:12:09] <scalex000> I get this invalid character
[22:12:10] <aniasis> for some reason $(window).load({}) isn't working correctly.  It is firing before everything is loaded.
[22:15:18] <coldhead> scalex000: is it the JSOn returned by this? http://enviosboya.com.do/form_login/Domain/SenderInfo.php
[22:15:25] <coldhead> are you sure it returns the same data on both servers?
[22:15:45] <scalex000> i put the same id,
[22:15:55] <scalex000> need to return the same data
[22:16:01] <scalex000> consume the same webserver
[22:16:09] <scalex000> consume the same webservice
[22:17:08] <coldhead> i just pasted this into json lint '{"Success":false,"Message":"No pudo ser encontrado el remitente con el nro. de documento 1.","Data":null,"Target":"Server Call","Code":null,"Notifications":[]}'
[22:17:10] <coldhead> it is valid
[22:17:40] <coldhead> oh scalex000 are you trying to do getJSON() or ajax() to a different domain?
[22:18:45] <scalex000> I check the code and see json
[22:19:12] <coldhead> good luck scalex000 !
[22:19:38] <scalex000> :'(
[22:20:31] <coldhead> don't be sad!
[22:20:33] <coldhead> it's okay!
[22:21:50] <aniasis> $(window).load() is executing before the page finishes loading
[22:21:55] <aniasis> does anyone know why?
[22:22:19] <coldhead> maybe load() has a different definition of what "loaded" means to you
[22:22:49] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onload
[22:22:56] <coldhead> officially it seems to mean EVERYTHING is loaded
[22:23:05] <coldhead> what are you seeing still loading, aniasis?
[22:26:53] <aniasis> coldhead, all images
[22:28:05] <coldhead> how are you loading the images?
[22:28:19] <coldhead> if they're <img>s in the original html of the page
[22:28:25] <coldhead> they should finish loading before load() fires
[22:28:38] <aniasis> no
[22:28:45] <aniasis> they are injected onto the page
[22:28:52] <coldhead> then they are not part of load()
[22:29:04] <coldhead> otherwise load would have to wait forever
[22:29:09] <coldhead> in case you injected something later!
[22:29:20] <aniasis> but they are part of the load in firefox
[22:29:37] <aniasis> it only behaves like this in IE
[22:29:46] <coldhead> it's probably not well defined
[22:29:51] <aniasis> even though that is probably correct behavior
[22:29:57] <coldhead> i mean it probably even depends on when your code runs
[22:30:17] <coldhead> if you want to do something after injected images load you probably want to bind a load() for each othem
[22:30:24] <coldhead> each of them*
[22:30:31] <aniasis> I figured that
[22:30:40] <raj> if I remove an element that has an eventhandler on it, is it a waste of memory if I don't remove the eventhandler?
[22:30:41] <coldhead> want me to demo a simple approach?
[22:30:44] <aniasis> No
[22:30:51] <aniasis> I can do a load for each image
[22:30:56] <coldhead> oh good
[22:31:00] <coldhead> godspeed, aniasis
[22:31:11] <coldhead> raj: i think it depends on the browser
[22:31:12] <coldhead> oh wait
[22:31:15] <coldhead> if you are using on()
[22:31:17] <coldhead> then yes
[22:31:22] <coldhead> that still lurks
[22:31:28] <coldhead> in case you put the element back
[22:31:38] <raj> damnit
[22:32:32] <coldhead> aniasis: nice excuse to use deferreds if you want to run one handler once multiple load events are fired
[22:32:34] <coldhead> #justsaying
[22:42:08] <aniasis> coldhead, yea I think I will have to use deferreds
[22:59:55] <tevfik> hi all
[23:00:18] <coldhead> hi!
[23:17:23] <aqeel> hi
[23:29:23] <coldhead> hi
[23:31:20] <tw2113> hi
[23:56:22] <ItsJustMe> Hey community. I don't find my mistake .. If I only check for one value everything works fine, but I need to check multiple inputs .. http://jsfiddle.net/ZHPwE/
