[00:08:26] <tehOPEologist> sup all
[00:15:11] <tehOPEologist> why isn't jquery interpreting this correctly?
[00:16:02] <tehOPEologist> http://jsfiddle.net/y8efG/
[00:16:22] <tehOPEologist> the jquery is what i'm not understanding once the click is initiated
[00:16:33] <tehOPEologist> the brackets are outside the <a> tag
[00:16:48] <tehOPEologist> but it somehow gets interpreted inside the <a> tag once the click function activates
[00:16:52] <tehOPEologist> any ideas?
[00:17:25] <rainabba> tehOPEologist: Just a guess, buy try escaping the brackets with \
[00:17:32] <tehOPEologist> hmmmm okay
[00:17:33] <tehOPEologist> sec
[00:17:46] <tehOPEologist> do brackets normally need escaping?
[00:17:57] <tehOPEologist> never asked jquery to interpret them before
[00:18:26] <tehOPEologist> no dice with escaping ( escaped with \ )
[00:18:34] <rainabba> They're used in data constructs so I'm sure they do under special circumstances and jQuery is VERY flexible and intelligent so maybe it's not taking that html as literally as you expect.
[00:18:46] <tehOPEologist> yeah, that's what i'm thinking.
[00:19:05] <tehOPEologist> what's the other way you could output brackets?
[00:19:14] <tehOPEologist> like &gt; &lt;
[00:19:21] <tehOPEologist> is there something like that for brackets?
[00:19:22] <rainabba> Also, you might want to declare that <a> using $("a", { href:"#", text:"login" })
[00:19:44] <tehOPEologist> why that way as opposed to the way i did it?
[00:19:48] <rainabba> Also, you might want to declare that <a> using .append($("a", { href:"#", text:"login" }))
[00:20:16] <rainabba> The way I just showed actually creates a DOM object.
[00:20:17] <tehOPEologist> please elaborate on why..  what would be the purpose of doing that, when it's technically working aside from the bracket interpretation?
[00:20:23] <tehOPEologist> would it affect the interpretation?
[00:21:01] <rainabba> Lots of ways "technically work" but aren't best. jQuery provides MANY ways to do something, but there are various advantages to each.
[00:21:18] <tehOPEologist> what would be the advantage of your way?
[00:21:23] <tehOPEologist> *what would be advantageous
[00:21:43] <tehOPEologist> i'd just like to know
[00:22:13] <tehOPEologist> still getting a grasp on how jquery's used in tandem with js's already existing list of function
[00:23:45] <rainabba> Also, your <a> already has href set to index.html so when you click that preceeds the JS event and so your .click() call isn't doing anything. That's intentional?
[00:24:29] <tehOPEologist> well
[00:24:31] <tehOPEologist> the ida
[00:24:31] <rainabba> "my way" isn't my way, it's the jQuery way of creating DOM elements. You're just setting some text to be parsed as HTML which might not even be valid.
[00:24:32] <tehOPEologist> *idea
[00:25:02] <tehOPEologist> i know..  i'm still trying to figure out how to output what i've thought up..
[00:25:14] <tehOPEologist> when #login_click hasn't been clicked
[00:25:23] <tehOPEologist> i want #logo to stay as a href to index.html
[00:25:32] <tehOPEologist> so, that's why it's the way it is
[00:26:50] <rainabba> But when it's clicked, you're changing the href to #. What's the point if you're sending the user to a new page?
[00:28:49] <rainabba> Btw, it looks to me like jsfiddle is broken. It's returning 404 for styles.css and scripts.js Wonder if that's preventing you from even testing.
[00:29:06] <tehOPEologist> naw, i've got it on another server running
[00:29:27] <tehOPEologist> i change the href once clicked, because it's not meant to take the user anywhere
[00:29:44] <rainabba> Still, curious why you'd bother changing the link when the click is going to navigate them to another page. Unless you've oversimplified your example, seems you're trying to do something completely pointless.
[00:29:44] <tehOPEologist> the click is only meant to do something else to another element
[00:30:06] <rainabba> But it DOES do something. It requests index.html and loads a new page.
[00:30:19] <tehOPEologist> that's before the click event's called
[00:30:26] <rainabba> If you just want to capture the click, you don't need the <a>. Just bind .click() to the div
[00:30:33] <tehOPEologist> hm
[00:30:37] <tehOPEologist> good idea
[00:30:49] <rainabba> <a> is SPECIFICALLY to navigate
[00:30:54] <rainabba> :)
[00:31:06] <tehOPEologist> i was using it as a selector to specify the div i wanted
[00:31:14] <tehOPEologist> that's probably why it's doing what it's doing..  makes more sense
[00:31:22] <tehOPEologist> i'm thinking in css still, i think >_<
[00:31:22] <tehOPEologist> rofl
[00:31:30] <rainabba> http://www.1stoptutorials.com/Website_Design_The_CSS_Way.html
[00:31:39] <tehOPEologist> thanks for clarifying that.  i'm gonna mess with it and be right back :3
[00:32:09] <rainabba> No, you're not thinking in CSS YET. You're still thinking oldschool HTML. "The CSS WAY" with JS could do just about everything with only <span> :)
[00:32:22] <tehOPEologist> ROFL
[00:32:25] <tehOPEologist> god, span
[00:32:26] <tehOPEologist> hahaha
[00:32:26] <tehOPEologist> ^_^
[00:32:59] <tehOPEologist> i feel like <span>'s the red-headed stepchild of div, but still has some talent
[00:33:01] <tehOPEologist> rofl
[00:33:12] <tehOPEologist> for text specifically
[00:33:15] <rainabba> That's a bit painful though so generally you use span and div AT LEAST. Of course, with HTML5, things have come back to sanity a bit and the "CSS WAY" craze has died down. You should structure your page with HTML, style it with CSS, and manage behaviors with JS.
[00:33:19] <tehOPEologist> never really used span for anything else
[00:33:36] <rainabba> <span style="display:block;"> = <div>
[00:33:39] <tehOPEologist> that's what i'm trying to do
[00:33:49] <tehOPEologist> ROFL omf, never thought to do that HAHAHAHAHA omfg
[00:33:52] <tehOPEologist> that's ridiculous
[00:33:53] <rainabba> <span> is for inline containers and if you're not using it, you are WRONG.
[00:33:59] <tehOPEologist> wow
[00:34:00] <tehOPEologist> wait
[00:34:03] <tehOPEologist> so like
[00:34:08] <tehOPEologist> if i have a div
[00:34:21] <tehOPEologist> and there's another container i want in that div container
[00:34:24] <tehOPEologist> i should use span?
[00:34:25] <tehOPEologist> O_o
[00:34:30] <tehOPEologist> the way you described?
[00:34:39] <rainabba> <DIV id="myBigOleHeaderBlock"><SPAN id="myHeaderText">HERE IS MY HEADER</SPAN></DIV>
[00:34:58] <tehOPEologist> supplementary elements in the parent element?
[00:35:15] <tehOPEologist> regardless of what the supplementary element is displaying?
[00:35:21] <tehOPEologist> be it an area or text?
[00:35:21] <rainabba> There SPAN is used to style the text while the DIV structures the entire header and contains the text itself.
[00:35:28] <tehOPEologist> (and by area, i mean container)
[00:35:57] <rainabba> area and text are their own containers which you can apply a class or id to so wrapping them in a span wouldn't add much value if any.
[00:36:14] <rainabba> span in an inline container.
[00:36:15] <tehOPEologist> true
[00:36:20] <tehOPEologist> hm okay
[00:36:26] <tehOPEologist> well let me play around with this information
[00:36:33] <tehOPEologist> gonna see if i can make it more semantic
[00:36:35] <rainabba> http://dustwell.com/div-span-inline-block.html
[00:36:46] <tehOPEologist> and make more sense, code-wise, with what i'm wanting it to do
[00:37:33] <tehOPEologist> also wtf, i used the conference room command to stop seeing all these people logging in/out, and it's still displaying -_-
[00:37:54] <tehOPEologist> i used / set irc_conf_mode 1
[00:37:57] <rainabba> Good code will always make sense after the fact. Can't write it though until you understand what "it" is :)  It's an itterative learning process for most of us mortals. I've been building web pages since the early days of AOL and I'm STILL constantly learning despite being a FULL time professional web developer :P
[00:38:00] <tehOPEologist> "not an operator" -_-;;
[00:38:40] <tehOPEologist> rofl yeah, i'm at the threshold of finding a career in this, and i'm constantly trying to learn more about other ways to do things the way i do them
[00:39:09] <tehOPEologist> i'm a huge idea maker, just outputting the ideas takes more time, because i have to itemize all the things i want to do
[00:39:09] <tehOPEologist> >_<
[00:39:56] <tehOPEologist> and btw, taking out a in the selection worked
[00:40:49] <rainabba> :)
[00:40:54] <tehOPEologist> word, making headway
[00:40:55] <tehOPEologist> ^_^
[00:42:46] <tehopeologist> there we go
[00:43:17] <tehopeologist> using xchat now >_<
[00:44:40] <tehopeologist> hm
[00:44:47] <tehopeologist> now i'm thinking about animating slowly....
[00:45:18] <tehopeologist> could i add a parent function to run on top of the css being changed that's an animator?
[00:45:25] <tehopeologist> that just makess the change go slow?
[00:45:39] <tehopeologist> it's hard to type, you'd have to understand what i'm typing and see it, too
[00:45:46] <tehopeologist> i'll make a fast version real quick, then show you that
[00:45:48] <tehopeologist> sefc
[00:45:49] <tehopeologist> *sec
[00:46:26] <fotoflo__> hmrmm
[00:47:02] <fotoflo__> I'm firing an ajax request at http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/ … my success and complete functions work, but my error function never gets hit if there's a 404
[00:48:56] <rainabba> fotoflo__: Is a page 404 an .ajax error or would that be trapped somewhere else?
[00:48:58] <fotoflo__> "When data is retrieved from remote servers (which is only possible using the script or jsonp data types), the error callbacks and global events will never be fired."
[00:49:43] <rainabba> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4281274/jquery-ajax-404-handling Check out .ajaxError() perhaps?
[00:53:29] <rainabba> fotoflo__: For more help, please paste code to jsfiddle or the likes.
[00:53:50] <fotoflo__> reading the stack overflowe
[00:54:00] <fotoflo__> it looks like there isn't a solution there
[00:57:06] <fotoflo__> @rainabba: http://jsfiddle.net/bC4Du/
[00:57:28] <fotoflo__> there doesn't seem to be an answer
[00:57:51] <rainabba> Oh i'm sure that's not true
[00:58:06] <rainabba> You aren't the first person to experience a 404 using ajax :)
[00:59:31] <fotoflo__> I'm sure youre right about that
[00:59:47] <fotoflo__> but the documentation on this particular issue is bad
[00:59:56] <rainabba> What makes you think that you're getting a 404 anyway?
[01:00:26] <rainabba> http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/8tv0AwOcU-o?v=2&alt=json  is returning results for me
[01:00:55] <rainabba> Oh. One sec. Trying your "invalid" Id.
[01:02:41] <fotoflo__> another question: if i want to queue up a bunch of ajax requests and callback when they're all done, how do i do that?
[01:06:33] <fotoflo__> http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.when
[01:07:07] <fotoflo__> i wonder if i can stick a $.each(array, $.ajax() ) inside that when
[01:13:05] <fotoflo__> rainabba: any idears?
[01:15:14] <rainabba> Something else is borked here.
[01:15:22] <rainabba> complete is never hit either and it should be.
[01:15:27] <tehopeologist> rainabba, so i did what i wanted it to do fast
[01:15:29] <tehopeologist> want to see?
[01:15:43] <tehopeologist> http://croppedin.com  ,  then click on log in on the top nav bar
[01:15:55] <tehopeologist> on that click, it changes that whole div
[01:16:52] <tehopeologist> it's probably a messy way to do it, but that's what i invisioned..  now i need to "animate" the main container getting wider by metephorically pulling the in (now login) from left to right
[01:17:15] <tehopeologist> instead of it just doing all of that instantaneously
[01:27:40] <rainabba> fotoflo__: Here's your final answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6698426/how-do-i-handle-a-json-request-that-fails-when-im-using-ajax-and-jsonp
[01:27:40] <tehopeologist> can i make a var with key commands like .html?
[01:28:16] <tehopeologist> pseudo-example: var meow = .html("someshit");});
[01:28:24] <rainabba> tehopeologist: Wanting to use .html() likely means you're doing something wrong and if by var you mean JavaScript, then you're confusing things big time :)
[01:28:26] <tehopeologist> minus the last little bit
[01:28:38] <tehopeologist> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[01:28:44] <rainabba> Ok, back to where we were before.
[01:28:57] <fotoflo__> rainabba: thanks, reading
[01:29:04] <rainabba> .html() is basically .SetInnerTextToSomeArbitraryString() No good.
[01:29:23] <tehopeologist> k
[01:29:37] <rainabba> var newDomElement = $("div", { id:"foo", class:"bar"} ); is good though.
[01:29:46] <horrror> Is there anyway to change css with animation?
[01:30:01] <rainabba> Then you could do $('#someOtherDiv').append(newDomElement);
[01:30:09] <horrror> If someones clicks X the entire htmlbackground changes
[01:30:10] <fotoflo__> rainabba: which one is the correct answer?
[01:30:18] <rainabba> jQuery animation handles all the css for you. Do one or the other.
[01:30:34] <fotoflo__> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1002367/jquery-ajax-jsonp-ignores-a-timeout-and-doesnt-fire-the-error-event/1002797#1002797
[01:30:57] <rainabba> fotoflo__: The issues you're having is cross-domain + jquery .ajax + jsonp. You have to use the "this" plugin from what I gathered there.
[01:31:11] <rainabba> Otherwise you need to use CORS instead.
[01:32:20] <horrror> can i animate background image?
[01:32:36] <horrror> $().animate(background: "blablabla")
[01:32:36] <horrror> ?
[01:42:24] <fotoflo__> rainabba: all you have to do is set a timeiout
[01:42:25] <fotoflo__> 
[01:42:29] <fotoflo__> timeout
[01:42:48] <fotoflo__> how lame is that.. all that work for one line of code...
[01:43:09] <rainabba> Seriously?
[01:43:12] <fotoflo__> yeah
[01:43:22] <fotoflo__> you can't really know what the error is
[01:43:25] <fotoflo__> but its good enough
[01:43:25] <rainabba> I kept reading that but thought it didn't apply here since you were getting a 404.
[01:43:43] <fotoflo__> I'm getting the 404 but its going nowhere
[01:43:46] <fotoflo__> so my function times out
[01:44:12] <fotoflo__> if you NEED TO KNOW what the error is, then you may want to use that plugin
[01:44:28] <fotoflo__> i don't care what the error is
[01:44:36] <rainabba> fotoflo__: Wow! Well, you might want to check out my "cleaned up" version of your code.http://jsfiddle.net/bC4Du/38/
[01:45:52] <fotoflo__> rainabba: good reading, thanks
[01:46:07] <fotoflo__> whats the XHR vs jqXHR?
[01:47:27] <rainabba> jqXHR is just the object name for the first param. Name it foo if you like :) The param is returnStatus info I believe.
[01:47:39] <rainabba> Or the response as a whole which includes .status
[01:51:11] <fabien_> Hi
[01:54:37] <fabien_> I have a little question. I have to do a sidebar that contain the menu. But I don't know how to do that with jquery. My element is a div named #sidebar wich contain different element like a search box, list of menu... By default the sidebar have 243px width. When the mouse leave the sidebar, I'd like to do an animation who reduce the sidebar to 43px
[01:55:18] <fabien_> Any ideas ?
[01:56:40] <fabien_> I have an example, I want to do a things like this : www.sidlee.com
[01:57:01] <fabien_> (The right sidebar)
[02:05:01] <ejo> the real question is do you understand the CSS to do it.
[02:05:16] <ejo> because the only role of jQuery will be the event handling to set the proper CSS...
[02:06:58] <mynameisthom> hello, i'd like to know more about 'absolute selectors' and why people not recommend using it, and mark it as 'common design mistake'? Thank you.
[02:07:59] <fabien_> Ejo, yes i'm a webmaster, but I neva did anything with jQuery
[02:10:32] <ejo> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[02:11:46] <fabien_> I did some search and I think I have to use : .hover and .animate
[02:12:47] <ejo> that should take care of it.
[02:13:16] <fabien_> But I can't find how can I do this : Change proprety for the #sidebar and for his childs (When the sidebar reduce ---> display:none; to child elements)
[02:13:43] <RLa> trying to create popup with jquery-mobile and then show it programmatically but the popup's content just appears as is and no popup works
[02:14:14] <RLa> when i try to open the popup, it says: Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on popup prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'
[02:14:46] <RLa> a div with data-role="popup" is in the page div
[02:19:25] <ejo> fabien_: just have a wrapper div between the sidebar and all children and set the wrapper div's display:none
[02:20:13] <ejo> and of course do that immediately after the .animate() finishes, using the 'complete' callback option in .animate()
[02:24:52] <storlihoel> so, I've never used jQuery, but I know some html and css.  I wan't to pull data from a site running on the same server (in a subcategory) as my main wordpress-installation.  it would be good if I could tell it what data to pull (e.g from <div id="navigation"> to </div>).  I have googled this, but couldn't find a clear answer.  any examples?
[02:31:06] <BinaryKitten> storlihoel hey
[02:31:19] <storlihoel> hola
[02:31:30] <BinaryKitten> if you can modify the html for that tag
[02:31:39] <BinaryKitten> you can add data-XXX attributes
[02:31:46] <storlihoel> yeah, well
[02:31:46] <BinaryKitten> eg data-category="washing"
[02:32:00] <storlihoel> I suppose I could edit the wordpress-pages' html
[02:32:04] <BinaryKitten> then you can pull that via the jquery link for processing
[02:32:17] <storlihoel> aha
[02:32:30] <BinaryKitten> eg var myCat = $('#navigation').attr('data-category')
[02:32:33] <storlihoel> so, that info needs to sit in the "external" page I'm trying to pull data from
[02:32:49] <BinaryKitten> urm on the page you are on.
[02:33:00] <BinaryKitten> or at least somewhere the script can access it before request
[02:33:10] <BinaryKitten> otherwise the request will not know that info
[02:33:20] <storlihoel> sure, but
[02:33:24] <storlihoel> lets take it from the top:
[02:33:32] <BinaryKitten> k
[02:33:46] <storlihoel> 1) wordpress-site.  2) other site I want to pull data from, and into wordpress-site.
[02:33:53] <BinaryKitten> right
[02:33:54] <BinaryKitten> sorry
[02:34:08] <BinaryKitten> you want to load html from a part of a page to update the current page?
[02:34:29] <BinaryKitten> are they on the same domain?
[02:34:50] <storlihoel> site 2) is in domain.com/subfolder
[02:34:54] <storlihoel> site 1) is domain.com
[02:34:59] <BinaryKitten> ok that's cool
[02:35:13] <BinaryKitten> and you want to load the navigation from the page in domain.com/subfolder
[02:35:21] <BinaryKitten> and show it on the page in domain.com
[02:35:26] <BinaryKitten> ?
[02:35:28] <ruby_on_tails> hmm...
[02:36:00] <BinaryKitten> if so that's $('#target').load('/subfolder #navigation');
[02:36:03] <storlihoel> BinaryKitten: yeah, not navigation exactly, but some data, yes
[02:36:11] <storlihoel> BinaryKitten: where do you put that
[02:36:27] <BinaryKitten> anywhere you want it to fire
[02:36:42] <BinaryKitten> how are you wanting to trigger this?
[02:36:45] <ruby_on_tails> BinaryKitten: you like to write tutorials ?
[02:36:55] <BinaryKitten> ruby_on_tails sometimes
[02:37:10] <BinaryKitten> depends on the mood i am in
[02:37:47] <BinaryKitten> ruby_on_tails i am trying to find a way to monetize my good mood
[02:38:09] <BinaryKitten> but unfortunately i don't seem to be able to find a good outlet
[02:38:55] <storlihoel> BinaryKitten: umm.
[02:38:58] <BinaryKitten> storlihoel how are you triggering the load?
[02:39:03] <storlihoel> that codesnippet
[02:39:04] <BinaryKitten> or how are you wanting to triger it
[02:39:29] <storlihoel> I want to put a part of the code in the header of the wordpress-page
[02:39:36] <BinaryKitten> ah
[02:39:44] <BinaryKitten> you can't just have that 1 line in the header
[02:39:56] <BinaryKitten> the page hasn't loaded the target at the time
[02:39:56] <storlihoel> but maybe you should start from top, since I'm not familiar with jQuery
[02:40:09] <BinaryKitten> ah i can't give you a full jQuery tutorial
[02:40:35] <BinaryKitten> but you will need to use Document Ready to make the code wait until the document has finished loading
[02:40:41] <storlihoel> of course
[02:40:52] <storlihoel> right, that's what I'm talking about
[02:40:55] <BinaryKitten> any script in the head will not be able to find any of the items you use to search
[02:41:55] <BinaryKitten> so ?.ready
[02:41:59] <BinaryKitten> ?.ready
[02:42:01] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[02:42:15] <BinaryKitten> ?.load(url)
[02:42:15] <bot-t> .load(url, data, [complete]): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[02:42:29] <BinaryKitten> those are the 2 bits you need for the simple stuff
[02:43:12] <storlihoel> first, document ready.  where does that sit?
[02:43:37] <BinaryKitten> ah that comes from the really early starter setup
[02:43:44] <storlihoel> and then load, where I want the code to appear?  seems like some information is missing
[02:44:19] <BinaryKitten> well i could give you the full script.. but then i'm not helping you, i'm doing it for you
[02:44:59] <BinaryKitten> you need to 1) load jquery 2) use the document ready to run a function that contains the code to load the page at the desired point into the desired location
[02:45:02] <storlihoel> I'm not asking you to give me the full script
[02:45:18] <BinaryKitten> there are examples of which in both of the links previously supplied.
[02:46:21] <BinaryKitten> I need to head off now
[02:46:36] <BinaryKitten> have other things to do on a saturday
[02:46:36] <storlihoel> sure, but
[02:46:41] <BinaryKitten> but?
[02:46:52] <ruby_on_tails> BinaryKitten: try this http://thecodeplayer.com/play/add
[02:47:02] <storlihoel> my question is simply. where does the "ready" go, and where does the "load" go
[02:47:12] <horrror> i have problems with changing the background image
[02:47:18] <storlihoel> the ready I suppose should sit in the htmls <head> ?
[02:47:28] <horrror> i'm using this: http://pastebin.com/FcmVW4hT - and from some reason the image doesn't change to the other one
[02:47:38] <storlihoel> nevermind.  I'll look at the documentation you gave me, BinaryKitten.  thanks!
[02:47:39] <horrror> it stays default image and i can't change it
[02:54:38] <mynameisthom> hello, i'd like to know more about 'absolute selectors' and why people not recommend using it, and mark it as 'common design mistake'? Thank you.
[03:02:33] <ejo> avoiding absolute selectors == avoiding tight coupling between html and javascript
[03:03:02] <ejo> == easier to maintain
[03:03:54] <mynameisthom> ejo: in other words, I should place it separately?
[03:13:30] <ejo> use relative selectors, so your code will remain more flexible and won't break when you change some things in your HTML.
[03:15:55] <mynameisthom> ejo: Aaa.. I thought a little bit get it. Like in a function with dinamic id, right? CMIIW. Maybe a ref link would helpful :D

[03:47:43] <chatterbox> I am looking for a free mobile simulator in Linux, any suggestions?
[04:37:19] <iamtakingiteasy> hi, i am using jquery ui autocomplete and i am kind of stuck. how do i get current search term (not value of input box, which may be changed on drop-menu entry focus, but value which user typed by hand)?
[04:39:21] <iamtakingiteasy> got it.
[04:39:29] <iamtakingiteasy> $('#AutocompleteElementID').data().autocomplete.term is the value i want
[04:56:30] <fotoflo__> hmm, using node.js to scrape a page with jQuery. my results look very different from regular jQuery: http://kuaibbs.com/pic/2012-12-01_2055.png  any idea why?
[05:00:07] <geekbuntu> fotoflo__, just a guess since i do not know how you're setting up your scrape script (and i do not know nodejs), but try setting your callback to varname[0] = i think what you want is in the object
[05:00:36] <fotoflo__> uh?
[05:00:43] <fotoflo__> one more time?
[05:00:45] <geekbuntu> look at your image
[05:00:50] <geekbuntu> you have keys
[05:00:54] <geekbuntu> [0]
[05:00:58] <geekbuntu> [1]
[05:01:02] <fotoflo__> all the data right
[05:01:06] <fotoflo__> all the data is in there
[05:01:12] <geekbuntu> you need to iterate your scrape results
[05:01:14] <fotoflo__> but its not accessible with standard query functions
[05:01:21] <fotoflo__> I'm doing that...
[05:01:32] <fotoflo__> s/query/jQuery
[05:01:56] <geekbuntu> like i said - just a guess, but i think you need to iterate one level deeper
[05:02:13] <geekbuntu> if it's possible - setup a fiddle
[05:02:44] <geekbuntu> will make your problem more approachable by anyone who looks at it
[05:04:00] <fotoflo__> no fiddle
[05:04:02] <fotoflo__> its node
[05:10:28] <geekbuntu> hm, maybe pastebin
[05:17:00] <gavri> I'm using $.ajaxSetup() to add a request header to all AJAX request headers. is there a way to include request headers in all image requests made with img tags?
[05:17:01] <seltar> I'm struggling with a $.post operation in IE8. The data keeps returning undefined.
[05:17:52] <gavri> I can't use cookies because I want this scoped to only one tab
[05:18:27] <gavri> and I can't add query parameters to the src attribute of the img tags because they are included as part of HTML fragments returned from the server
[05:21:52] <seltar> seriously? anybody else have problems with $.post in IE8?

[06:32:59] <zubelgenubi> PHP developer new to jqm. Is there a good place to find best practices on where to put my php in my jqm page? So it doesn't break with ajax? Should it all be inside data-role='page' ? or should I try to implement MVC?
[06:35:04] <niyazpk> @zubelgenubi if you want jquery mobile specific answers, you might want to look at #jquerymobile on freenode.net
[06:37:04] <niyazpk> Other than that I am not really sure whether I understand the statement "where to put my php in my jqm page". Isn't your jquery code and php code supposed to be separated in some way?
[06:40:46] <zubelgenubi> ok thanks. I couldn't join #jquerymobile. Says invitation only (?)    I guess my question really was - to what extent should I be separating my php from my jqm pages? and if anyone knew of templates or examples I could browse. There's lots of examples of the html to use to implement jqm, but not where to put the php when developing a webapp.
[06:43:26] <geekbuntu> zubelgenubi it's not detailed help but some vague tips here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9362510/what-is-the-best-practice-organize-a-jquery-mobile-application

[06:53:42] <ThomasBerends> Anybody got experience with localScroll ?
[06:57:29] <niyazpk> What do you want to know about localScroll?
[06:58:15] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: I can't get it working. No idea what I'm doing wrong..
[06:58:55] <niyazpk> link? demo? jsfiddle?
[06:59:37] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: Can't give a live demo. But this is what I have: http://pastebin.com/xwScwzNQ .
[07:00:18] <ThomasBerends> It currently does nothing, so I propably made a stupid mistake or something. :( Kinda new to JQuery and been messing with this for 2 days now.
[07:03:48] <niyazpk> Can you please explain what you mean by "does nothing"? Is the url changing in the addressbar? What happens when you click on a link?
[07:04:30] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: The url doesn't change and nothing happens. So. It really does nothing. :(
[07:05:05] <niyazpk> Ok. Let me try the code.
[07:05:30] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: If I remove the content between the <script> tags, the anchors work. But with the code, it doesn't work anymore.
[07:06:54] <niyazpk> ok
[07:08:20] <bleen> http://jsfiddle.net/uU8kk/  … why wont the alert fire?  It does if I remove the 2 .add() functions from the selector.  What am I missing here?
[07:11:11] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: Can you see what I'm doing wrong?
[07:11:50] <niyazpk> TB: Can you please share your current css too....?
[07:12:49] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: http://pastebin.com/3q9uhRze

[07:14:59] <aqeel> bleen
[07:15:00] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/uU8kk/1/
[07:15:17] <aqeel> click user login
[07:16:35] <niyazpk> TB: seems to be working? http://jsfiddle.net/7hPhg/
[07:16:41] <aqeel> bleen try to use on() and not live()
[07:17:15] <bleen> aqeel: clicking user/login doesnt do anything
[07:17:48] <peterschmidler> Who knows how I can get the width of a p like in here: http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/nqEmv
[07:17:52] <aqeel> i am receiving a login password screen
[07:17:54] <niyazpk> aqeel: does not seem to be working for some reason...
[07:18:19] <niyazpk> which is wrong. right.? It should alert something according to the code...
[07:18:33] <Log1x> how would i go about doing an if/else statement outside of a function? like this: http://privatepaste.com/download/196a6413f4
[07:18:36] <bleen> aqeel: I am too .. but that isnt what I want to happen … event.preventDefault(); should prevent the link from going to the href
[07:18:38] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: Hmm. Mine is horizontal (using javascript). But I don't think that should mess it up, right?
[07:18:49] <Log1x> well, for a function* even
[07:19:03] <peterschmidler> Aaah float: left...
[07:19:10] <bleen> aqeel: additionally I'm trying to add this event to only certain links … not all … it looks like your code is intended to add a click to all teh links
[07:19:27] <aqeel> i converted to on()
[07:19:27] <niyazpk> TB: it might... hmmm.. can you edit the jsfiddle to make it look like what you want?
[07:19:31] <aqeel> for revfernce
[07:19:36] <aqeel> referrence..
[07:20:26] <bleen> aqeel: I see that, but using your example, the click event does not fire on any of the user/* links
[07:20:39] <aqeel> wait..
[07:20:59] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: I edited it. Not sure why it doesn't run like it's supposed to..
[07:21:05] <niyazpk> Log1x: like in php? Not possible in javascript... Sorry (Well strictly speaking, it may be possible using some eval magic, but it is not recommended)
[07:21:29] <Log1x> ahh dang
[07:22:49] <niyazpk> TB: Can you please share the url of the jsffidle (after saving it) which fails to work?
[07:23:30] <bleen> aqeel: changing live() to bind() on my original jsfiddle seems to work
[07:23:48] <aqeel> better, bind then live
[07:23:53] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: http://jsfiddle.net/TnXTT/
[07:24:01] <aqeel> yet on() is the future
[07:24:23] <aqeel> http://www.andismith.com/blog/2011/11/on-and-off/
[07:25:23] <niyazpk> bleen: strange.
[07:26:10] <niyazpk> TB: seems to be wroking.. No? :)
[07:26:23] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: It should move to the right..
[07:26:25] <niyazpk> Or are you saying that it works here, but not in your code?
[07:27:14] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: It doesn't work here. for me.
[07:36:49] <aqeel> bleen your synstax
[07:36:56] <aqeel> bleen: http://jsfiddle.net/uU8kk/2/
[07:38:25] <bleen> aqeel: that also works … is there a reason you are specifically not using the signinLinks var I have?
[07:38:55] <bleen> aqeel: just curious
[07:39:10] <aqeel> no i just want to make sure that it does work, might be your syntax, causing it to not work
[07:39:30] <aqeel> trying with your var now
[07:41:08] <niyazpk> bleen: Is this a case of something not working specifically on jsFiddle? or is it not working elsewhere too?
[07:42:13] <bleen> niyazpk: using live() it is not working on my local site (Drupal7 - jq: 1.4.
[07:42:14] <bleen> 4
[07:42:26] <niyazpk> TB: as far as i can see, localScroll is just a pretty wrapper around scrollTo. Look at the code: https://github.com/flesler/jquery.localScroll/blob/master/jquery.localScroll.js
[07:44:51] <aqeel> bleen: http://jsfiddle.net/uU8kk/3/
[07:45:21] <aqeel> happy....solved
[07:46:04] <niyazpk> TB: ..which means that you could just try something like: $.scrollTo( '#page4') to see if that works fine before even using the localScroll plugin.
[07:46:42] <niyazpk> TB: what I am trying to say is that this may not be a problem with localScroll, but with the original scrollTo plugin
[07:47:28] <niyazpk> aqeel: nice. but i am still curious to why the live call failed.
[07:47:53] <aqeel> live seems to have issues
[07:48:14] <pachet> live is deprecated ;[
[07:48:43] <aqeel> bleen: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8042576/whats-the-difference-between-jquery-live-and-on
[07:48:48] <aqeel> read the tick part
[07:49:13] <niyazpk> Even with live it works!!! : http://jsfiddle.net/uU8kk/4/ Looks like it was just a matter of wrapping the returned value in $. for whatever reason.
[07:49:55] <bleen> aqeel: awesome… thanks
[07:50:12] <niyazpk> But here it fails: http://jsfiddle.net/uU8kk/5/ So now it looks like it is an issue with the jQuery version.....
[07:50:39] <niyazpk> so bleen: update your juery version :) easier said than done. I know. Especially in drupal..
[07:50:49] <bleen> :)
[07:51:05] <aqeel> yup
[08:05:04] <AntonKor_> hey peeps, what is the simplest/ best way to detect all mobile devices (phones and tablets)
[08:05:13] <AntonKor_> using jquery ofcourse
[08:08:00] <AntonKor_> i guess i should ask what plugin / library have you used in the past
[08:20:22] <ThomasBerends> niyazpk: " $.scrollTo( '#page4')" goes to another page, but doesn't provide a animation.

[09:45:09] <ziz_> Hey guys I am looking for a plugin that allows for this http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/ where the nav sticks to the top and allows for the nav items to be 'selected' when its to it's section.. I knwo this plugin works but its more of a general plugin that can do a lot more, is there somethign more refined for what I'm looking for?
[09:48:56] * laure hello

[10:12:53] <codygman> When a .click() is triggered, when does it exit? I have 2 .click() events in my jquery and one doesn't run after the other one is triggered
[10:14:15] <codygman> My client exited... did I miss anything?
[10:18:13] <niyazpk> codygman: can you give more details please? Probably a jsFiddle.net test case?
[10:23:43] <codygman> After the $('#signup').click(), $('#resend-email').click() doesn't get triggered: http://bpaste.net/show/VhCemfl5lyuqK5SRBZzD/
[10:26:58] <niyazpk> Oh.. that is because the second time it is a 'new' #resend-email element, not the original one you bound the even to.
[10:27:40] <codygman> niyazpk: How do I get the original?
[10:27:52] <niyazpk> Take a look at the "on" event handling technique: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:28:58] <niyazpk> Basically something like $('body').bind('click', #resend-email', function() {});
[10:28:59] <codygman> niyazpk: Alright, thanks :D
[10:29:40] <niyazpk> oops
[10:29:53] <niyazpk> sorry that was a typo
[10:30:07] <niyazpk> $('body').on('click', #resend-email', function() {});
[10:31:05] <codygman> niyazpk: Thanks, that is easy. All I needed was that doc page :)
[10:31:16] <niyazpk> Good to know :)

[11:32:28] <hateIE> how do i dump the contents of an object to console again?
[11:34:53] <abjorn> depends on the console
[11:34:57] <abjorn> for instance in chrome you could just
[11:35:02] <abjorn> console.log(obj);
[11:35:11] <abjorn> should work in recent FF too
[11:35:26] <abjorn> but if it's not working in whatever browser you're testing on, you could try console.log(JSON.stringify(obj));

[11:52:28] <hateIE> $tcell.append("heyy i am on the schedule!");
[11:53:49] <Cronoh2> yeah i dont think that selector works ?
[12:05:48] <warbler> How can I use these 2 jQuery versions at the same time? http://pastebin.com/TpEPhq58
[12:06:06] <warbler> It seems my shoutbox needs one version and my login function needs another...
[12:06:33] <warbler> Using one or the other breaks one of the functions... =(
[12:17:31] <warbler> How can I use these 2 jQuery versions at the same time? http://pastebin.com/TpEPhq58
[12:29:21] <tw2113> why would you want to warbler ?
[12:29:42] <warbler> on pointstackers.com the shoutbox is conflicting with the 'login' button
[12:29:50] <warbler> they both depend on different versions it seems
[12:30:02] <Cronoh2> time to update the old code
[12:30:04] <Cronoh2> :P
[12:30:24] <warbler> yea if only this wasn't my first day of learning jQuery the hard way
[12:35:05] <warbler> I'll figure it out.
[12:35:11] <warbler> I'm an aries.
[12:36:51] <warbler> Cronoh2 before I attempt to change extensive amounts of code... would a solution like this work? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2665496/using-2-different-jquery-releases-on-the-same-page
[12:37:12] <warbler> when these are the scripts I'm using: http://pastebin.com/TpEPhq58
[12:38:32] <warbler> Getting warmer I think: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[12:38:48] <tw2113> ouch?1.2.6?
[12:39:05] <tw2113> that's not old, that's jurrasic
[12:40:52] <warbler> It's borrowed shoutbox framework code...
[12:41:21] <warbler> I'm not yet knowledgeable enough to update all the code to use the latest jQuery library. I'm learning though. =)
[12:41:37] <tw2113> who you're borrowing that from needs to
[12:42:20] <warbler> It was just some ancient google result...unmaintained code.
[12:42:37] <warbler> I didn't want to use some bloated chat system....you don't learn anything that way.
[12:42:48] <Cronoh2> time to learn
[12:42:58] <warbler> My goal is to eventually jQuery the living hell out of pointstackers.com
[12:43:27] <tw2113> ouch?may 24th 2008 for that plugin
[12:43:35] <tw2113> er jquery version
[12:43:49] <warbler> Then use my other 50+ gaming sites to push massive traffic to it.
[12:44:07] <warbler> and $$$ like mad! :)
[12:44:16] <warbler> But first I must make it prettiful.
[13:08:04] <kroniksnevy> I need some suggestions. I dont know much JavaScript butt prolly enough to acomplish this i hope. I want to make a jquery plugin for T-Shirt design there are non out there basically i want a premade t-shirt to be loaded on to a "stage" and then give the user ability to write text or add an image on it.
[13:08:26] <kroniksnevy> There is nothing outthere similar to this thats working or does not cost 10k for 1 licence
[13:08:38] <Cronoh2> must not be as easy as you think to make then
[13:08:43] <Cronoh2> :)
[13:09:05] <kroniksnevy> Can anyone suggest where would be the best point to start maybe a libary ? I want to make this pretty simple.
[13:09:42] <kroniksnevy> will offer a paypal beer for good suggestion
[13:09:48] <kroniksnevy> or a sixpack
[13:10:49] <rmurphey> kroniksnevy: as Cronoh2 said, if licenses for similar software are going for $10k/each, this may be a bit harder than you're thinking
[13:11:15] <kroniksnevy> I might have bloaded that
[13:11:19] <kroniksnevy> its more like 1k
[13:11:25] <rmurphey> are you willing to pay $1k?
[13:11:31] <kroniksnevy> only fond one site that sells it
[13:11:45] <kroniksnevy> but only if you buy their store app with it
[13:12:41] <kroniksnevy> No im not i would like to make something similar but simple and make it free for all
[13:12:58] <kroniksnevy> i mainly need it for my website
[13:29:38] <hateIE> how can i call $.getJSON .. multiple times so i can incriment a number
[13:30:06] <hateIE> i tried it in a loop but then things start to miss behave
[13:30:10] <hateIE> in a for loop
[13:33:17] <hateIE> http://jsfiddle.net/zZQqv/1/
[13:37:55] <rotham> hey... anyone here know how to specify custom labels on the xaxis in flot?  I am using php to generate the labels, i just want to take the array and have flot put them in order on the axis...
[13:54:18] <hateIE> hah
[13:54:37] <hateIE> that problem is a scope issue
[14:04:05] <Alex2> hi everyone
[14:11:53] <ewaibel> hi, i'm trying to get the jQuery UI Dialog widget to stack (tile) on top of each other when multiple dialogs are opened, does someone know how to do this?
[14:12:05] <ewaibel> the default behavior seems to just place them on top of each other
[14:26:37] <shoky> ewaibel: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-stack
[14:27:08] <ewaibel> shoky: that just stacks them on top of each other
[14:27:19] <ewaibel> i need them stacked offset of each other
[14:29:36] <shoky> oh tile
[14:30:59] <shoky> dunno of any built-in feature
[14:34:32] <ewaibel> shoky: you have any recommendations on the best way to accomplish?
[14:39:05] <shoky> ewaibel: nothing specific comes to mind.. i'd just.. start doing it, thinking first exactly how i want it to be..
[14:43:05] <istvan> hello - I have a div that is scaled with css (transform: scale(.5) -- how can I get the outerHeight with the scale compensated for?
[15:05:57] <LuisLeite> good evening
[16:02:11] <warbler> Would someone please take a look at the shoutbox on http://pointstackers.com and tell me why the scrollbar isn't showing up? I've done everything _EXACTLY_ as the instructions said. I fear it may be a simple css issue.
[16:02:51] <veQue> found this function to add comma from doing a search... http://jsfiddle.net/AG6gC/1/  but it places comma in wrong spot. anyone know a quick fix?
[16:04:07] <ejo> warbler: +1 on simple css issue likelihood
[16:04:20] <warbler> Thank God I'm getting smarter.
[16:04:25] * warbler pats self on back
[16:05:06] <warbler> Coming from perl trying to implement jQuery into my website without any respectable knowledge of even javascript has proven to be quite the arduous task.
[16:05:36] <masak> warbler: learning JavaScript pays off in spades, in my experience.
[16:05:36] <warbler> I've probably burnt out 3 of google's servers over the past 8 hours.
[16:05:39] <ejo> i see you used overflow:auto; did you try overflow:scroll instead?
[16:05:47] <ejo> not that it should be necessary, but worth a shot
[16:05:55] <warbler> ejo I shall try it.
[16:06:19] <veQue> nvrmnd i think i found a plugin... has to learn how to use plugin
[16:06:21] <ejo> ^ agree with masak here... jQuery without really knowing javascript first is asking for difficulties and blind spots
[16:07:07] <warbler> ejo, you were referring to the css of .contentshoutbox right?
[16:07:11] <warbler> I just want to be sure...
[16:07:21] <ejo> yes
[16:07:51] <warbler> Still no scrollbar...this is strange. =/
[16:08:06] <warbler> ...I followed instructions very carefully even.
[16:08:34] <ejo> time to learn all about conditions under which a browser does and does not display a scrollbar: there are some good articles out there on that subject
[16:08:41] <ejo> I'm sorry I don't have any specific links for you
[16:09:21] <warbler> Believe me I've been all over google before humbly begging in here lol.
[16:09:36] <warbler> I'll keep trying I suppose.
[16:10:19] <ejo> it's quite likely to be just some of the fine print about CSS behavior.  Like you've set the overflow property on that element, but the other elements you insert into it end up not being affected, or not affecting the content height so the scroll bar is never drawn.
[16:10:21] <ejo> that kind of thing.
[16:11:55] <ejo> You could ask in #css and I think that would be more productive than #jquery for this.
[16:12:46] <ejo> What a lot of experts (unlike myself) will want to see before even really looking at your question is some sort of minimal test case where you build a stripped-out version of the same page that has just enough in it to show the problem.
[16:13:09] <ejo> And then in the process of building that minimal test case, you pretty much always discover the root of the issue and fix it.
[16:13:32] <ejo> Others prefer to squeeze a desktop teddy bear and ask it for special insight, seems to work well too
[16:13:35] <warbler> Here's what I'm dealing with if anyone cares to take a gander: http://jsfiddle.net/W4he6/
[16:13:49] <warbler> I've asked in #css as well. =)
[16:14:10] <ejo> oh I'm sorry, it slipped my mind that you had linked a fiddle earlier
[16:14:33] <warbler> Apprehensive about asking in ##javascript -- the last time I did that I got my head chewed off.
[16:14:58] <veQue> anyone know a good bit of code that  places the comma in the right spot as i type numbers?
[16:15:00] <warbler> Some guy chimped out like I just stole his girlfriend about how jQuery is not javascript.
[16:15:01] <ejo> well I could see ##javascript responding to your question about why the thing didn't scroll to the bottom, since that counts as behavior
[16:15:03] <veQue> two fails so far
[16:15:13] <ejo> but they definitely don't answer jQuery in there for good reason
[16:15:21] <warbler> Right on.
[16:15:24] <veQue> first one adds first comma in wrong place second one fails for decimals
[16:15:25] <ejo> and they normally direct non-behavior issues to #css
[16:15:46] <warbler> I'll definitely be remembering that.
[16:18:01] <anew> jquery is not javascript !!!
[16:18:22] <veQue> thought it was
[16:18:24] <anew> j/k lol
[16:18:34] <veQue> oye
[16:18:38] <ejo> well warbler, I know it's a royal pain to do, but you should probably try continuing to strip your test case down until you CAN get a scrollbar, and so on
[16:18:45] <ejo> decompose and conquer
[16:21:29] <warbler> That's the thing...I've already tried that several times. It's ok though (I hope) I've posted on the official google groups page for the jScrollPane library.
[16:21:38] <veQue> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2632359/can-jquery-add-commas-while-user-typing-numbers .. i would love to use this guy's solution but it's wrong
[16:21:41] <veQue> any help?
[16:23:33] <ejo> that really does not sound so hard to solve in an on-change handler for the input field
[16:24:33] <veQue> 10000 should be 10,000 not 1,0000
[16:26:07] <tw2113> just curious how it's wrong
[16:26:41] <veQue> it has 4 digits behind the  first set of numbers
[16:26:46] <veQue> not 3
[16:26:55] <tw2113> so fix the example?
[16:27:05] <veQue> i'm looking into it
[16:27:21] <veQue> i just started learning regex
[16:28:02] <shoky> veQue: change it to keyup
[16:28:06] <shoky> instead of keypress
[16:28:14] <veQue> ok
[16:28:56] <veQue> hey cool sir.
[16:29:01] <veQue>  you are a genius
[16:29:09] <shoky> l0l
[16:30:51] <tw2113> shoky the genius
[16:30:58] <warbler> Shoky is awesome.
[16:38:11] <veQue> i'm googling but i'll throw this minnow out there anyway, i want on focus to move my caret to the right end of my last character

[16:48:14] <Farhan> can any one tell me that how to generate random name for multiple file uploaded using php code
[16:50:31] <nightfly_> timestamp? hash of contents?
[16:59:51] <badbandit> hello, is there a way to target 2 different buttons in a form within a .submit call?
[17:28:09] <tw2113> anyone know how to check if a keyCode is in a set array?
[17:28:20] <tw2113> indexOf isn't working for me
[17:31:20] <shoky> set array?
[17:31:39] <tw2113> one i already populated and put in a variable
[17:32:05] <shoky> so.. indexOf isn't working? what's next, tw2113
[17:32:20] <tw2113> find a way to work around it and check a different way
[17:32:31] <shoky> on your own, sure
[17:32:36] <shoky> and if you want help?
[17:32:45] <tw2113> ask more detailed questions
[17:32:50] <tw2113> or go to #javascript
[17:32:51] <shoky> aka jsfiddle
[17:32:52] <shoky> ;]
[17:36:26] <niyazpk> use inArray: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[17:39:02] <ejo> badbandit: your question is a litle ambiguous
[17:40:58] <tw2113> i wish console.log was working for me gff
[17:41:01] <tw2113> grrr even
[17:44:11] <badbandit> ejo: nm, solved it, I am using stripe.js and have 2 buttons inside a form and I needed to specifically target just one of them
[17:44:19] <badbandit> ended up just using .click instead of .submit on the form
[17:45:49] <veQue> weird i cant seem to get my font-size to work at all through css but it works through jquery somewhat
[17:46:47] <veQue> does .val(variable.toSting())  modify font at all?
[17:48:35] <iamtakingiteasy> how do i use CascadeType.ALL with Unique constraints on some columns in table?
[17:49:40] <iamtakingiteasy> how do i avoid hibernate's try to insert entries which fields are not unique in given table?
[17:51:04] <shoky> veQue: .val(...) doesn't modify font..
[17:51:21] <veQue> it's so strange
[17:51:34] <veQue> i'll try in jsfiddle
[17:51:36] <shoky> what is
[17:53:38] <veQue> it works perfectly fine in jsfiddle
[17:53:51] <veQue> maybe jquery mobile or something is overriding it
[17:55:33] <veQue> shoky: yeh basically i'm not seeing any font change
[17:55:48] <shoky> veQue: i have no idea what you're talking about
[17:56:15] <veQue> yeh. I think i've found the culprit
[17:56:27] <veQue> the jquery.obile.css is messing it up
[17:56:41] <shoky> groovy..
[17:56:57] <niyazpk> iamtakingiteasy: This is a jquery specific irc. Not sure whether there are any hibernate experts in here.
[17:57:18] <iamtakingiteasy> ahh
[17:57:19] <iamtakingiteasy> sorry
[17:57:22] <niyazpk> veQue: !important all the things! :)
[17:57:22] <iamtakingiteasy> misses the channel
[17:58:03] <niyazpk> iamtakingiteasy: Take it easy... :)
[17:58:12] <iamtakingiteasy> eajjjjy
[17:59:33] <veQue> i dont get it i have my style.css linked underneath the jquery.mobile.etc.css yet my font-size wont override theirs
[18:00:19] <maxmythic> Would it be a best practice to use CSS3 transitions to do effects that jQuery can do?
[18:00:26] <shoky> veQue:  make your selectors more specific
[18:00:42] <tw2113> ok, i figured out my array issue
[18:00:45] <veQue> ok id instead of class?
[18:00:48] <veQue> i'll try
[18:00:55] <tw2113> it wasn't actually an array, it was a string of #s that i was thinking was an array, like a n00bsauce
[18:01:24] <shoky> veQue:  more like.. if jquery mobile has:   .someClass { font-size: whatever }
[18:01:55] <shoky> then you should prolly have smth like:   #myElement.someClass { font-size: yehh }
[18:02:04] <shoky> or  #myContainer .someClass { font-size: wowow }
[18:02:11] <shoky> or .. something more specific than  .someClass
[18:02:15] <shoky> but that still targets .someClass
[18:02:24] <veQue> hmm ok
[18:02:28] <veQue> let me try
[18:03:38] <niyazpk> veQue: more about css specificity: http://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/
[18:04:21] <veQue> ok well i just used the #id
[18:04:27] <veQue> worked out
[18:04:50] <veQue> well rememebr ot look into that
[18:08:25] <veQue> oh good your trick works too
[18:08:37] <veQue> saves some copy and pasting
[18:18:35] <hugo_moss> hello, im attaching an event listener to a link click, and when that link is clicked a menu is faded in, which is causing a memory leak
[18:18:47] <hugo_moss> is this normal
[18:19:23] <warbler> anyone know why the heck there is extra space at the bottom of the shoutbox? http://www.pointstackers.com/
[18:20:04] <tw2113> this line would prevent some code from executing again wouldn't it? $(document).unbind('keydown',arguments.callee);
[18:33:39] <ralphsaunders> Hey all, any help with troubleshooting this weird delegate behaviour would be appreciated, http://pastie.org/private/bydpeandgqmwceiz9nlbka
[18:36:42] <darkfrog> Hey guys, I'm using ckeditor, but I'm trying to listen to value change on my original textarea so I can update the editor when it changes.  Unfortunately change events aren't being fired on my textarea anymore.  I can check the value of the textarea and it's being changed, but it's not firing events for the change.
[18:36:56] <darkfrog> anyone have any idea why this might be happening and a way around it?
[18:38:31] <niyazpk> ralphsaunders: this.moveSlides($('[div*="left-arrow"]') would call the function immediately at the binding time right? Not when you click the butttons... right?
[18:40:38] <ralphsaunders> Would it? As I was calling it inside jQuery's delgate method, I thought it'd only be called later? niyazpk
[18:42:24] <niyazpk> yeah.. it is being called when you bind it. That is why you see the logs on page load.
[18:42:43] <ralphsaunders> ah ok. But why the subsequent errors on click?
[18:44:32] <niyazpk> That I will need to look into more deeply. Not sure. Depends on how delegate calls the fn provided.
[18:45:02] <ralphsaunders> I had a look at the stack in the log, but it only contains stuff from jquery
[18:45:21] <niyazpk> Here problem is that when delegate tries to call the event handler, if does not find one, bcoz nothing was provided.
[18:46:16] <ralphsaunders> I thought I was assigning this.moveSlides() as the event handler?
[18:46:19] <niyazpk> what should be provided to delegate is a fn name/handle so that delegate can call it when the event fires.
[18:46:56] <niyazpk> what is happening here is that delegate is getting the return value from the fn call you made...
[18:47:29] <ralphsaunders> Oh, from addControls() ?
[18:48:30] <niyazpk> no i mean moveSlides
[18:48:41] <niyazpk> Try this change and see what happens.... : http://pastie.org/5464963
[18:48:43] <ralphsaunders> Oh right
[18:49:05] <niyazpk> change is in the moveSlides fn
[18:49:52] <ralphsaunders> mmm. Sorts out the error, although moveSlides is called twice.
[18:50:43] <niyazpk> yeah but do you see 'called' in the log when you click on the arrows?
[18:50:51] <ralphsaunders> Yes, sorry I do.
[18:51:10] <niyazpk> and do you see 'called' on page load?
[18:51:26] <ralphsaunders> Nope
[18:51:40] <niyazpk> excellent....
[18:52:28] <niyazpk> so basically don't think in terms of delegate. This does not even reach the delegate method... This is just javascript in action...
[18:53:04] <ralphsaunders> But why does moveSlides get called twice when I click only one of the buttons?
[18:53:20] <niyazpk> when I call $(_parent).delegate(2+2), since delegate will be called (since delegate is a fn) with the argument 4 right?
[18:54:50] <niyazpk> similarly when you call it with $(_parent).delegate(fn()) the fn() part is evaluated first and then the result is passed to delegate as an argument.... (which was probably false in the first case)...
[18:54:53] <niyazpk> sorry for the rant....
[18:55:14] <niyazpk> oh.. how do you know it is being called twice?
[18:55:51] <ralphsaunders> I'm logging the action argument and it shows up with 'pop' and then 'push' when I click either button once.
[18:56:29] <niyazpk> hmmm
[18:57:09] <niyazpk> not sure why.. can you please create a simple jsfiddle test case with this?
[18:57:16] <ralphsaunders> ah I think I might have worked this out
[18:57:22] <ralphsaunders> two ticks
[18:57:45] <niyazpk> Also I think in the delegate calls, you could replace $('[div*="right-arrow"]') with just the selector which in this case would be '[div*="right-arrow"]'
[18:58:05] <Richhh> my problem from jQueryUI angle:    http://jsfiddle.net/ZB7vs/            my problem from pure jQuery angle:   http://jsfiddle.net/c7qwW/
[18:59:46] <niyazpk> ralphsaunders: did you fix it? and if yes, how?
[19:00:27] <ralphsaunders> No, I thought I had a brain wave, but nope :p
[19:01:48] <ralphsaunders> Maybe I don't need delegate for this, but something else
[19:02:10] <niyazpk> $().on
[19:02:29] <niyazpk> .. is preferred over delegate i think
[19:05:07] <ralphsaunders> It may be because I'm using an old version of jQuery
[19:05:16] <niyazpk> k
[19:05:23] <ralphsaunders> (thanks to Wordpress being a knob about which version it'll load)
[19:06:29] <niyazpk> oh btw please change that selectors to just .".right-arrow" instead of [div*="right-arrow"]
[19:06:45] <niyazpk> it will work the same here right?
[19:07:12] <Richhh> any ideas?
[19:07:45] <d4rklit3> hi
[19:07:50] <Ballresin> The #highcharts room is quiet. I'm trying to figure out why this chart isn't showing a clean range left to right. http://jsfiddle.net/B6f6J/
[19:08:38] <d4rklit3> how do i use jquery to drill to the parent of the event target until it hits an <li>
[19:08:52] <niyazpk> Ballresin: hmmm... data is wrong?
[19:09:14] <niyazpk> d4rklit3: $(this).closest('li')
[19:10:08] <Ballresin> Highcharts can be a panzy if you don't sort datetime data ascending, but I've done that. The rest is just the high/low data points.
[19:10:46] <d4rklit3> closest
[19:10:47] <d4rklit3> nice
[19:11:32] <ralphsaunders> niyazpk: this may be a bit simpler, from a code point of view. Although it's still not working as it should, heh. http://pastie.org/private/6cofk5wbvegvebltemog
[19:14:20] <niyazpk> Try this: http://pastie.org/5465018 notice the changed moveSlides Fn
[19:15:27] <ralphsaunders> aha!
[19:16:12] <ralphsaunders> This worked for me, http://pastie.org/5465024
[19:16:37] <ralphsaunders> I don't quite understand why it needs to be wrapped in an anonymous fn, but thanks for your help niyazpk :)
[19:18:58] <niyazpk> As i said before, you should be providing a fn handler to delegate, not call a fn - read my previous rant on this please :) It will be clearer
[19:21:05] <ralphsaunders> I did read it, but I think I am passing a handler?
[19:21:38] <tw2113> callback functions?.callback functions everywhere
[19:23:06] <niyazpk> if a and b are functions, if you do a(b), you are passing b as a parameter/handler/callback as jquery is expecting.
[19:23:49] <niyazpk> if you do a(b()), you are sending the return value of b to a, not b itself. That is the difference. makes sense?
[19:24:28] <ralphsaunders> Ah I see
[19:25:29] <ralphsaunders> What jQuery expects in this instance would make my code very messy
[19:25:36] <StevenD> hey I just met you and this is crazy but heres my number so call me baby
[19:26:13] <tw2113> hey I just met you and this is crazy but heres my function so callback me maybe
[19:26:43] <StevenD> tw2113,  Nice
[19:28:37] <tw2113> hey I just $('you') and $(this) == 'crazy', but here's my function() so callback me maybe
[19:29:28] <StevenD> tw2113,  You're beautiful
[19:30:06] <tw2113> i do what i can
[19:30:27] <Bytephilia> I'm having some problems with jquery easing. the last bits of easing take way too much time
[19:31:11] <StevenD> So I think since boredom is the problem and I have nothing to make i'm gonna play a game
[19:31:18] <StevenD> any nay sayers ?
[19:31:32] <tw2113> go play Halo StevenD

[19:38:57] <Richhh> hiiya
[19:39:16] <oksushi> hmm? hi
[19:39:17] <warbler> using jScrollPane on pointstackers.com shoutbox and I have one final problem left...on page load theres a bunch of space at the bottom of the chat container...the css rule responsible for this is .jspPane -- somehow though after about 30 seconds it automagically changes size and the space disappears...pretty sure my webserver is possessed by satan, any help would be appreciated. =)
[19:45:00] <imsky> oy
[19:46:19] <batmanbond3d> Hey, I am getting drifting issues with position fixed with safari on iOS, anyone know of this issue?
[20:28:20] <d4rklit3> does jquery automatically fix html5 symantics for ie7/8 ?
[20:29:27] <batmanbond3d> This will help a bit
[20:29:28] <batmanbond3d> http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/
[20:29:42] <batmanbond3d> but a lot of HTML5 fearues won't work in IE7 and IE8
[20:29:51] <d4rklit3> a shiv eh?
[20:30:54] <d4rklit3> i just wanna make sure the page doesnt break
[20:31:23] <batmanbond3d> still might break
[20:32:03] <d4rklit3> client wants us to use some html5 symantics
[20:32:05] <d4rklit3> like <nav>
[20:32:11] <batmanbond3d> that will work
[20:32:15] <d4rklit3> yeah
[20:32:17] <d4rklit3> possible article
[20:32:30] <d4rklit3> what im not sure about is why...   this site is rendered by the browser
[20:32:45] <d4rklit3> can google even crawl that?
[20:34:15] <batmanbond3d> the shiv is for older browsers
[20:34:20] <batmanbond3d> of IE
[20:34:30] <batmanbond3d> should be ignored unless you are running IE7/IE8
[20:34:46] <d4rklit3> yep
[20:36:35] <tw2113> does 7/8 recognize it can style the new tags?
[20:37:07] <tw2113> i'm thinking not
[20:37:15] <tw2113> shiv would be needed for all IE below 9
[20:37:34] <d4rklit3> i dunno this client is always like lets do a bunch of seo
[20:37:36] <d4rklit3> and then
[20:37:38] <d4rklit3> they forget about it
[20:37:39] <d4rklit3> heh
[20:37:45] <d4rklit3> same thing with analytics
[20:37:54] <d4rklit3> beginning of project, they are quite gung ho about tracking every fucking thing
[20:37:57] <tw2113> html5shiv has nothing to do with SEOs
[20:38:01] <d4rklit3> yeah
[20:38:02] <d4rklit3> i know
[20:38:10] <d4rklit3> im not even sure why they want <nav>
[20:38:13] <d4rklit3> in regards to tracking
[20:38:24] <d4rklit3> the only thing they really wanted to use is pushstate
[20:38:28] <tw2113> that doesn't have anything to do with it either
[20:38:39] <d4rklit3> i have a call with them on tuesday
[20:39:00] <tw2113> they sound like the shiney people
[20:39:11] <tw2113> they hear/see something shiney, they must have it
[20:39:15] <d4rklit3> Fox
[20:46:37] <warbler> Is there a way to use setInterval to not only chat in real time but allow people to copy paste without their hilight being reset by the interval updating the object?
[20:47:32] <warbler> for example the shoutbox on http://pointstackers.com updates every 3 seconds, if you copy text for longer than that it resets your cursor to nothing copied
[20:47:40] <tw2113> thought that occurred while i read that?possible to pause the timer on mousedown ?
[20:47:40] <warbler> im extremely new to jquery btw
[20:47:59] <warbler> ooh thats a good idea
[20:48:04] * warbler googles
[20:51:03] <warbler> tough finding example code for some reason
[20:51:04] <veQue> i;m using the ui-blocks . i want to achieve ->  [...........][....][....]
[20:52:21] <synapt> Any reason the .html method wouldn't reserve linebreak elements?
[20:57:56] <Zapsoda> Hey everyone, So what im trying to do is make the adminbar in the top right on http://beeteecee.com/ follow you down the page, I tried postion:fixed; but that messed with the menu :( any ideas?
[20:58:13] <Zapsoda> For you guys it will say create A New Account
[21:00:35] <mclenithan> if I have $('div.bar').prepend('<li><p> ....</p></li>')    how do I get that li item to fadeIn()?
[21:01:49] <tw2113> $('div.bar').prepend('<li><p> ....</p></li>').fadeIn() ?
[21:03:07] <tw2113> guess not
[21:03:07] <mclenithan> i tried that but i think when you attach the fadeIn(), it refers to the orginal $('div.bar') and not the html being added
[21:14:37] <ChannelZ> I'm building a table dynamically (adding rows to a table) and was trying to fade in each row with jquery.. but it doesn't seem to do anything.  http://pastebin.com/Zvig4paJ
[21:19:51] <ChannelZ> Bah nevermind.  My elements weren't hidden.
[21:37:45] <donkeycongo> When I bind a handler to the click-event on a generated element (ex. $("<div/>")), then put it into the DOM, remove it, and put it back in, it unbinds it. Can I do something to prevent this?
[22:11:00] <ejo> donkeycongo: instead of remove(), detach()
[22:12:44] <ejo> .remove() should be used as a final removal of an element, while detach() is more useful for temporary removal (maintaining all jquery data and handlers associated with the element)
[22:13:15] <donkeycongo> ejo: Will try that, thanks.
[22:14:19] <donkeycongo> ejo: Thanks man
[22:16:54] <ejo> np
