[00:01:55] <vivekananda> Cork, so I am down to 17 errors and trying to figure what the first three are referring to ie the no character encoding found etc. I will look them up to figure out
[00:02:59] <Cork> vivekananda: that is quite simple <meta charset="utf-8">
[00:03:23] <Cork> its just that you want to specify what encoding the page uses (and you should be using utf8)
[00:03:25] <vivekananda> yeah I am trying to get a sample of what a standard html should look like :). lemme look at google
[00:03:37] <vivekananda> google's page itself I mean
[00:03:47] <Cork> vivekananda: give me a min
[00:04:52] <Cork> vivekananda: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8829801
[00:05:17] <Cork> that is a minimal html template
[00:05:28] <vivekananda> ok got it
[00:05:31] <Cork> that is all that is required to be valid
[00:05:43] <Cork> and the meta tag is only recommended, not required
[00:06:02] <Cork> (it should only be a warning/info in w3c validator)
[00:07:47] <vivekananda> Cork, yeah that is what I was going to ask. Why am I getting a yellow triangle in the validator even after putting it ?
[00:08:05] <luaboy> Cork:how do I get the return string from server?
[00:08:22] <Uhkis> even that example can be minimalized
[00:11:07] <Cork> luaboy: depends on the language but ex. for php <?php echo string; ?>
[00:11:27] <Cork> Uhkis: you can remove the indentation and new lines but the rest is actually required
[00:11:30] <Cork> (except for the meta)
[00:12:33] <Uhkis> Cork: html, head and body end tags arent required either
[00:12:48] <Cork> Uhkis: if you want a modern html page, yes it is
[00:12:56] <Cork> Uhkis: without them you would be in quirk mode
[00:13:09] <marcusdei2> hi everyone
[00:13:55] <Uhkis> Cork: well my firefox stays in standards mode without them, also passes w3 validator
[00:14:14] <rcyr> Without what?
[00:14:38] <Uhkis> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8829803
[00:14:40] <Uhkis> that
[00:15:03] <rcyr> The doctype is mandatory or else it will trigger quirksmode in IE
[00:15:24] <rcyr> The meta is not necessary is your web server is properly configured and send the proper HTTP headers.
[00:15:27] <Cork> Uhkis: "Element head is missing a required instance of child element title."
[00:15:29] <rcyr> s/is/if
[00:15:33] <Cork> from w3c validator
[00:15:53] <Cork> Uhkis: remember a template should be something you can start editing in without
[00:16:01] <Cork> wihtout having to add more boilerplate
[00:16:11] <Uhkis> huh?
[00:16:26] <Uhkis> This document was successfully checked as HTML5! for me
[00:16:28] <Cork> Uhkis: ex. <doctype html><p></p> isn't valid
[00:16:46] <Cork> so yes <head></head><body></body> is needed
[00:16:59] <Cork> and title is mandatory in <head>
[00:17:14] <Cork> so again, yes that template is as small as you can get it
[00:17:18] <Uhkis> the title is right there!
[00:17:32] <Uhkis> and it even has text in it so it passes ;)
[00:18:07] <marcusdei2> guys can someone help me today with a small jquery assignment?
[00:18:10] <Cork> Uhkis: you should be able to start writing the html content for it to be a useful template
[00:18:42] <marcusdei2> http://easywebsite.nl/voorbeeld/fortune/
[00:18:48] <marcusdei2> @media width < 1216px
[00:19:04] <Cork> marcusdei2: if it is an assignment, doesn't that mean you should try to figure it out?
[00:19:10] <Cork> isn't that kinda the point of assignments?
[00:19:30] <marcusdei2> the sdiebars, i need the '+' into '-' after clicking and back into '+'
[00:20:05] <Cork> ugg... i was asked this exact question last friday...
[00:20:58] <Uhkis> http://i.imgur.com/WDoRj2v.png
[00:20:59] <Uhkis> ! :D
[00:21:06] <marcusdei2> let me make the whole thing in a fiddle
[00:21:07] <Cork> marcusdei2: thx for telling me this is an assignment work; means i can avoid plowing down my time in this question over and over again
[00:21:09] <marcusdei2> so we get it right this time
[00:21:23] <Cork> marcusdei2: its your homework, try to do it, as you're suppose to do
[00:21:39] <marcusdei2> it's not hoemwork
[00:21:52] <marcusdei2> It's for a client of the company I work at
[00:22:00] <Cork> Uhkis: tag soup, lovely...
[00:22:15] <Uhkis> Cork: i never said it was pretty :D
[00:22:17] <marcusdei2> now you do want me to make a promotion don't you ?
[00:22:33] <Cork> Uhkis: and you think it is a good idea to try to teach that to someone new to html development??
[00:22:35] <rcyr> Uhkis: The minimal valid document: <!doctype html><title>Hello!</title>
[00:22:51] <Jattenalle> > Can't figure out how to switch between + and -
[00:22:52] <rcyr> Uhkis: Of course, you can pick a shorter title...
[00:22:54] <Jattenalle> > Deserves a promotion
[00:23:40] <Uhkis> Cork: well of course not, that's why i didn't hilight him
[00:23:50] <rcyr> Uhkis: If you want to play that game... in your screenshot, head and body are optional.... closing <p> tags is also optional.
[00:24:03] <rcyr> Uhkis: <html> is also optional
[00:24:07] <Cork> Uhkis: so the argument that "the template could be shorter" wasn't tru
[00:24:09] <Cork> *true
[00:24:31] <Cork> you could remove the doctype too
[00:24:43] <Cork> and do perfectly valid quirk mode tag soup
[00:25:03] <Cork> <p>hello<li>list1<li>list2
[00:25:23] <Uhkis> Cork: i said it *can be minimized*
[00:25:29] <Cork> Uhkis: no it can't
[00:26:30] <Cork> Uhkis: to have a well formated standard complient template that was the minimal amount of tags
[00:26:40] <Cork> (again excluding the meta tag)
[00:27:58] <Uhkis> well if you add  that well formatted requirement
[00:28:03] <surianup> HI friends
[00:28:19] <rcyr> We're not your friend buddy!
[00:28:20] <rcyr> ;)
[00:28:22] <Cork> Uhkis: it was a template for html... of course that is a requirement...
[00:28:47] <rcyr> surianup: Welcome :)
[00:29:06] <surianup> you are not our friends But others are
[00:29:21] <surianup> because we chats everyday here
[00:29:22] <rcyr> :(
[00:29:30] * rcyr cries
[00:29:32] <surianup> that why we are frinends
[00:29:54] <surianup> If you think we are not it's your thinking
[00:30:01] <surianup> thanks by the way
[00:31:06] <jqueryius> on an ajax call I have:
[00:31:08] <jqueryius> error: function (xhr, status, error) {
[00:31:14] <jqueryius> but xhr.responseText is empty
[00:31:22] <jqueryius> I can't see any error text in the error obj either
[00:31:46] <jqueryius> In console I see: POST http://mypage.local/page1 net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
[00:31:51] <jqueryius> i'd be happy to get that text
[00:32:05] <jqueryius> but really any sort of error message would be helpful
[00:32:05] <rcyr> jqueryius: The url doesn't exists
[00:32:17] <jqueryius> rcyr: yep, I know I just want to log the actual message
[00:33:32] <Uhkis> cool, gmail has some github integration :O
[00:33:49] <jqueryius> Uhkis: really?
[00:33:54] <jqueryius> what is the integration?
[00:34:10] <jqueryius> is it through their api?
[00:34:23] <Uhkis> jqueryius: "View commit" "View issue" buttons on the email list
[00:34:37] <jqueryius> nice
[00:35:24] <jqueryius> i'd like to see github's api become a bit more advanced
[00:35:39] <jqueryius> it's pretty good, but there's so many more stats that could be derived
[00:36:07] <jqueryius> but IMO, github blows TFS out of the water
[00:37:49] <Uhkis> TFS?
[00:38:32] <surianup> I have an issue that is when when i select the "type" and select the option "pre-constuction" and "for-sale" then we need to show the "n/a" option which is working and I have other code for "subtype" select box when I select the "long term" then i am enable the "per" select box when select the option "short term" then enable the per night and disab
[00:38:32] <surianup> le the 2 others and "n/a" option for 1 year. everyting working fine one problem is there I have paste the code into the $('#type').change(function () {}); function means when I change the type after that it wuld work else not but I need if sub tyoe selected before it shoud work please help me how is it possible in jquery
[00:38:40] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/w8fte8ou/
[00:39:39] <jqueryius> Uhkis: microsoft's solution to source control
[00:39:59] <surianup> I know you experts can find the best solution for this
[00:40:08] <jqueryius> I will admit this - it has good integration with visual studio. But for everything else, github blows it away
[00:40:23] <jqueryius> Even the issue tracking, which a lot of people like about TFS... I like the way github does it more
[00:43:23] <surianup> anyone is here to help me ?
[00:44:20] <Cork> surianup: you should know by now to ask the question in a more efficient way
[00:44:34] <Cork> surianup: separate the backstory and the question
[00:44:43] <Cork> so ppl can quickly see if they can help
[00:45:24] <surianup> Cork :
[00:45:26] <surianup> I have an issue that is when when i select the "type" and select the option "pre-constuction" and "for-sale" then we need to show the "n/a" option which is working and I have other code for "subtype" select box when I select the "long term" then i am enable the "per" select box when select the option "short term" then enable the per night and disab

[00:45:34] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/w8fte8ou/
[00:45:52] <Cork> ...
[00:46:01] <Cork> surianup: i saw that the fist time
[00:46:23] <Cork> but that is a gigantic blob of text with the question woven into the backstory
[00:46:36] <Cork> meaning one have to read all of it before one can even know if they can answer it
[00:46:47] <Cork> result: i ignore it
[00:47:35] <surianup> ohh
[00:48:14] <surianup> now let me xplain in short
[00:48:59] <surianup> ny code is working fine
[00:48:59] <Cork> surianup: the explanation is fine, but separate the question from the story
[00:49:06] <surianup> I have paste the code into the $('#type').change(function () {}); function means when I change the type after that it wuld work else not but I need if sub tyoe selected before it shoud work
[00:49:22] <Cork> so one can check the question, and judge if there is even a point in reading the story
[00:49:43] <surianup> ok Cork I understood
[00:49:45] <Cork> remember we that help here do something beside helping
[00:50:02] <Cork> so if we have to stop that for too long we have to skip it
[00:50:24] <surianup> Fine cork
[00:50:48] <surianup> Now you got the question?
[00:50:55] <jqueryius> surianup: what is the type and what is the sub type?
[00:51:09] <jqueryius> The second dropdown = type, the third = sub type?
[00:51:21] <surianup> yes
[00:51:27] <surianup> you are right
[00:51:51] <jqueryius> and if either Pre-construction or For-sale is chosen as the type, then how does that affect sub-type?
[00:52:51] <surianup> it's not working there becase it changes on the base of ajax
[00:53:10] <jqueryius> i'm trying to understand the business rules
[00:53:25] <surianup> when you clcik on the type the sub type changes the options on ajax cal
[00:53:32] <jqueryius> Where do you need to show "N/A" if Pre-construction or For-sale is chosen?
[00:53:32] <surianup> ok i understand
[00:54:03] <surianup> on very first select box
[00:54:14] <surianup> I have taked the other select box for this
[00:54:25] <surianup> which name is na
[00:54:30] <jqueryius> but wouldn't the first box be the first thing the user modifies?
[00:54:38] <surianup> select id="na_price_per
[00:55:35] <surianup> jqueryius
[00:55:43] <surianup> I didn't indersatnd
[00:55:50] <surianup> understand
[00:56:11] <surianup> means we can not modifed the first one
[00:56:30] <jqueryius> It sounds like - by default you have 3 dropdowns: 1) per; 2) type; 3) sub-type
[00:56:49] <jqueryius> But then, depending on what is chosen for type, you want to add a 4th dropdown between 1) and 2) - called na_price_per
[00:56:52] <jqueryius> is that correct?
[00:57:18] <surianup> I am hiding the first and showing the other na_price_per if needed
[00:57:41] <surianup> when na_price_per  is displaing other 1 one should be hide
[00:57:59] <surianup> make sense?
[00:58:10] <surianup> did you understand jqueryius
[00:58:10] <surianup> ?
[00:58:12] <jqueryius> so the problem is, when you select Pre-construction or For-Sale - na_price_per is NOT showing. But it SHOULD?
[00:58:40] <Omar-> good morning
[00:58:41] <surianup> everthing is working for me here
[00:58:44] <jqueryius> Or do you want na_price_per to REPLACE per? (ie. per becomes hidden at the same time)?
[00:58:48] <surianup> problem is that
[00:58:58] <jqueryius> I don't understand, if everything is working what is the problem?
[00:59:08] <surianup> I have paste the code into the $('#type').change(function () {}); function means when I change the type after that it wuld work else not but I need if sub tyoe selected before it shoud work
[00:59:17] <vivekananda> Cork, still there ?
[00:59:36] <jqueryius> so you're saying the change event is not firing surianup?
[00:59:54] <vivekananda> down to 1 warning and 1 error how do I correct those ?
[01:00:01] <Uhkis> vivekananda: show
[01:00:06] <vivekananda> one sec
[01:00:45] <vivekananda> Uhkis, https://2f5d79e.ngrok.com/test2/safeview/www/
[01:00:57] <vivekananda> I mean that would be the validator link
[01:01:15] <vivekananda> Uhkis, http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=https%3A%2F%2F2f5d79e.ngrok.com%2Ftest2%2Fsafeview%2Fwww%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[01:01:19] <surianup> actually I am ussing this on the edit page of an hotel profile .....when User has selected the option type "rentel" in the create page  and value are shaved in the DB
[01:01:36] <surianup> I have fething the data from the Db on this page
[01:01:53] <Uhkis> vivekananda: utf-8, not utf8
[01:02:15] <surianup> if user have selected the the option before and it saved in the DB
[01:02:16] <vivekananda> Uhkis, where ?
[01:02:22] <vivekananda> where do I change that ?
[01:02:38] <surianup> the this code is not working fine
[01:03:02] <surianup> it working on only on the change event
[01:03:11] <jqueryius> surianup: there is no jquery enabled on that jsfiddle
[01:03:16] <jqueryius> it's set to pure JS
[01:03:17] <vivekananda> sorry got it
[01:03:53] <jqueryius> surianup: http://jsfiddle.net/w8fte8ou/1/
[01:03:57] <jqueryius> does that work like you want it to?
[01:04:05] <vivekananda> Uhkis, so what do I do with the warning http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=https%3A%2F%2F2f5d79e.ngrok.com%2Ftest2%2Fsafeview%2Fwww%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&ss=1&outline=1&group=0&verbose=1&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.3+http%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fservices
[01:05:08] <Uhkis> vivekananda: the warning is just because the validator uses experimental feature, you can't fix that
[01:05:32] <surianup> when I changes the option type then it works other wise not by default it's not working
[01:05:32] <vivekananda> yeah I guessed . good that all got fixed and can go back to the original question
[01:05:38] <surianup> jqueryius
[01:05:44] <Uhkis> vivekananda: which was? :)
[01:06:11] <jqueryius> surianup: I'm having trouble understanding you.... in less than 10 words can you describe what the actual problem is
[01:06:37] <jqueryius> Like...... "I click _________, I expect ____________, but I am getting _______________"
[01:07:05] <Uhkis> your template is over 10 words!! :D
[01:08:27] <jqueryius> I meant "I'm" instead of "I am" :P
[01:08:42] <surianup> ok let me expalin
[01:08:47] <surianup> 1 min pleaase
[01:08:49] <vivekananda> Uhkis, so can you now tell me what is wrong with the code. The question was -- on the webpage there is a dropbox. I want line 236 ( js/site.js) to get the value in that box and then line 241 ( same file) to send it to the page to which i am posting. Line 236 is currently not getting any values.
[01:12:33] <surianup> If it has selected the "Rental" the my code is not working
[01:12:39] <surianup> jqueryius
[01:12:58] <jqueryius> Okay
[01:13:03] <surianup> If it has selected the "Rental" type before then my code is not working
[01:13:04] <jqueryius> When you click Rentals:
[01:13:11] <jqueryius> Okay
[01:13:16] <jqueryius> When you click Rentals:
[01:13:20] <jqueryius> 1) What do you expect to happen
[01:13:20] <surianup> if I want to edit the Hotel profile
[01:13:23] <jqueryius> 2) What is currently happening
[01:13:40] <troop> hello, i have created a custom attribute for an <img> tag   which name is data-bigpic  when i want to alert this i see in content of data-bigpic in alertbox but when i want to assing it to another img src it wont. why?  $('changable').attr('src', $(this).attr('data-pigpic') ); this is not working?
[01:13:43] <surianup> it's a edit page basically
[01:13:44] <Uhkis> vivekananda: try console.log($(this)); in there before that line
[01:14:01] <surianup> If user want to edit the option then he can update it
[01:15:04] <jqueryius> surianup: when you click Rentals, precisely what do you want to see happen on the page
[01:16:20] <surianup> then normaly it calls the ajax and gets the  options that is log term, short term,1 year
[01:16:24] <surianup> its working
[01:16:27] <surianup> but now
[01:16:47] <vivekananda> Uhkis, yeah that is what I was trying but how do I identify what this is referring to ? it has a tonne of output inside the one object. I put some value= attributes for easier identification but is not helping
[01:16:53] <jqueryius> you don't have any ajax code in your fiddle surianup
[01:17:48] <surianup> when user selects the long term I am enabling the <select id="per option enable
[01:18:21] <jqueryius> At 4:30 (in 12 minutes) I have to leave surianup :(
[01:18:22] <vivekananda> Uhkis, I put it as you instructed. Could you take a look at the output on the console if you refresh the page and type three letters ( I use mic for microsoft ) . It will show up after 2 or 3 letters
[01:18:45] <surianup> when clcik on the short term then enable the per night other are disble
[01:19:09] <surianup> and when he clciks on the 1 year then N/a enable
[01:19:33] <Uhkis> vivekananda: so, $(this) does not refer to the searchbox
[01:21:19] <Uhkis> vivekananda: try $(this)['bindings'][0]
[01:21:45] <vivekananda> Uhkis, what is this referring to though. could you tell me wht it means ?
[01:21:57] <jqueryius> Sorry surianup, I don't know
[01:22:36] <jqueryius> Now you are talking about changing the third dropdown, and there's no jquery in your fiddle which shows you doing that
[01:23:48] <vivekananda> Uhkis, that gives me Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[01:24:05] <Uhkis> vivekananda: $(this).bindings[0] then?
[01:24:15] <vivekananda> ok sure one sec
[01:24:55] <Uhkis> vivekananda: or $(this).element[0]
[01:25:00] <vivekananda> same thing. ok
[01:25:04] <jqueryius> surianup: You might get more of a response if you try putting the question on stackoverflow where you can explain it in great detail, maybe you could show screenshots of what you want it to look like so people can understand your problem more easily
[01:25:13] <jqueryius> I have to go now, bye
[01:25:46] <Uhkis> vivekananda: or maybe even $(this).context
[01:25:51] <vivekananda> same error Uhkis . sure
[01:25:55] <surianup> thanks jqueryius
[01:26:01] <Uhkis> vivekananda: that object seems to be mangled by a lot of stuff
[01:26:05] <surianup> giving your time
[01:26:14] <surianup> jqueryius
[01:27:25] <vivekananda> Uhkis, that gets me an 'undefined' . Uhkis for a little bit I will just feed in a dummy value to the ingoing thing and see if the rest of the code there works
[01:27:54] <vivekananda> Uhkis, my final intent is to get back to this -- www.safeview.com ( try typing mic in the box and wait for a few seconds )
[01:34:11] <Uhkis> vivekananda: it works now? at least the ajax response looks fine
[01:34:56] <vivekananda> Uhkis, no it doesn't . that link is the prod site and the grok one is the one i am currently on. I haven't changed anything on the prod but
[01:35:01] <vivekananda> this one is screwed
[01:35:18] <Uhkis> vivekananda: i was talking about that ngrok.com site
[01:35:36] <vivekananda> Uhkis, for some weird reason the ajax is working there. It is not working in ngrok. you mean ngrok is working !!!
[01:35:39] <vivekananda> lemme check
[01:37:26] <vivekananda> Uhkis, the ngrok isnt working. I showed you a different site to show you what the working thing would look like
[01:37:58] <Uhkis> vivekananda: the ajax part is working fine
[01:38:10] <vivekananda> I am getting a response from the posted page. It is just not getting to the .done() on line 243
[01:38:16] <vivekananda> is it ?
[01:38:21] <vivekananda> why do I not see it ?
[01:38:28] <vivekananda> I dont see it working :(
[01:38:42] <Uhkis> your problem is in _rendering_ it, the data looks fine
[01:38:51] <vivekananda> sorry sorry did you mean just the ajax or the whole of autocomplete ?
[01:38:51] <Uhkis> Ffmpeg (70)
[01:38:57] <Uhkis> Ffmpeg (vendor)
[01:40:24] <vivekananda> Uhkis I am not getting any console output from line 244 in site.js. I should be getting it as I am merely echoing the data that should be received
[01:42:43] <Uhkis> typing mic in the search box executes ajax and returns {"type":"vendor","label":" Microsoft (215)","value":" Microsoft (vendor)"} and others
[01:44:03] <Uhkis> so to me it sounds like your problem is elsewhere?
[01:44:06] <vivekananda> Uhkis, yes i see the response. Did you try doing the same thing in the site www.safeview.com. do you see what happens on the page and also on the console ?
[01:44:37] <vivekananda> doing the same thing = typing mic in the box
[01:47:31] <vivekananda> Uhkis, think I solved it !!
[01:47:57] <vivekananda> try the ngrok again with mic :). I think there is some issue with the 'delay' and I have set it to 100. lemme try 500 again
[01:48:35] <vivekananda> hmm solved partially not completely yet
[01:48:53] <vivekananda> I have to look at how to not allow wrong letters again. It was working earlier :)
[01:49:30] <vivekananda> Uhkis, I am happy that something is working :)
[01:49:32] <vivekananda> lol
[02:17:09] <luaboy> $(function(){alert('12')})Ôºåwhat does this line do ?
[02:33:40] <Xatenev> alerts 12?
[02:35:51] <hollusion> too easy
[02:36:25] <hollusion> alerts 12 after the document is ready, to be more precise
[02:40:15] <elirips> Hello. Has anyone ever managed to get jquery into a comiled html help file (using docbook for the help-content and xsltproc and then the html-help-compiler)?
[02:51:09] <flobin> so in jquery you can do $('div').css({"transform":"translate(100px,100px)"});‚Äã
[02:51:20] <flobin> is there a way to change the 100px,100px to variables?
[02:51:22] <flobin> if so, how?
[02:52:53] <mooncup> $('div').css({"transform":"translate("+variable1+","+variable2+")"});
[02:53:30] <flobin> oh, that easy huh?
[02:53:31] <flobin> thanks!
[02:55:25] <flobin> hmm, I‚Äôm getting Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[02:55:46] <flobin> http://robinberghuijs.com/ink/proof.html
[03:09:01] <hrusti> I want to pass array to js with html data-attribute. What should be data-foo format that I could read like var $myArray = $element.data("foo") ?
[03:09:33] <robmal> attr
[03:09:50] <hrusti> ?
[03:11:03] <flobin> $(‚Äúelement:data(foo)‚Äù) I think
[03:12:23] <Cork> no there isn't a handler for accessing .data in a selector
[03:13:05] <Cork> hrusti: if you put json arrays in a data attribute .data will parse it as an array without doing anything special
[03:13:55] <Cork> hrusti: <elm data-foo="[&#x22;hello&#x22;,&#x22;world&#x22;]"></elm> $('elm').data('foo') === ["hello","world"]
[03:15:27] <hrusti> Cork: hmm
[03:16:00] <hrusti> Cork: what about if I serialize array in server side and deserialize in jquery?
[03:16:58] <Cork> hrusti: depends on what you mean by serialize
[03:17:15] <Cork> hrusti: .data supports json natively (you don't need to do anything)
[03:17:24] <Cork> if you don't use json you would have to write you're own parser
[03:17:42] <Cork> cause .data("foo") will just give you a string
[03:57:36] <aias> how do i know when i can place javascript links at the beginning or at the end of my html?
[03:58:11] <Cork> aias: if you beginning mean in the head
[03:58:35] <Cork> its basically if the script needs dom access, and doesn't use events to wait for the dom
[03:58:40] <Cork> it needs to be at the end of the body
[03:58:52] <slax0r> that, or a $(document).ready()
[03:59:02] <Cork> aias: if it on the other hand is a script other scripts depend on (like jquery) it should normally be loaded in the head
[03:59:14] <slax0r> only scripts that need to be in the head are those that need to execute something before the dom is loaded
[03:59:17] <Cork> slax0r: that would be the case i talked about
[03:59:49] <aias> makes sense
[03:59:56] <slax0r> Cork: well, if you have _all_ your scripts at the end of </body>, you can also include jquery there, as long as its the first one loaded
[04:00:21] <slax0r> err, first one = before the script that needs it
[04:00:24] <Cork> slax0r: except .ready will break if put jquery at the body end
[04:00:29] <Cork> so if a script uses .ready it won't work
[04:00:39] <slax0r> but why am I explaining you this, you know this stuff much better than me :D
[04:01:16] <Cork> aias: the only really true answer is that "it depends"
[04:01:17] <slax0r> Cork: oh, it will break? haven't noticed it
[04:01:37] <Cork> slax0r: ya, cause jquery won't know that the page has loaded, cause it will have missed all the events
[04:01:44] <slax0r> ah, gotcha
[04:01:48] <Cork> so .ready will just silence all the code
[04:02:05] <Cork> as long as you write the scripts expecting that, it should work just fine
[04:02:06] <slax0r> btw, what is up with all the .click(), .change() etc handlers in newer versions of jQ? have they been removed?
[04:02:23] <Cork> i don't think so
[04:02:34] <Cork> they will be VERY hard to remove, too much legacy code depends on them
[04:03:44] <Cork> i personally would actually support deprecating it in something like jquery 3
[04:03:57] <Cork> as they are reworking so much then anyway
[04:04:17] <Cork> oh... heh i just said why it won't happen :)
[04:04:38] <Cork> it would have to have been deprecated in jquery 1.9+ or 2.x for it to be removed in 3
[04:04:54] <DragonPunch> morning Cork <3
[04:04:56] <Cork> and i don't think they plan for another major breakage after 3 for a while
[04:04:59] <Cork> o/
[04:05:08] <Cork> its afernoon though ;P
[04:05:31] <randomguy_> crack of dawn here, >:)
[04:05:49] <Cork> 13:04
[04:05:54] <Cork> *5
[04:06:11] <slax0r> Cork: UGT :P
[04:06:38] <randomguy_> 06:06 here.  what were you talking about being hard to remove?  sorry, came in on the tail end
[04:06:55] <Cork> randomguy_: the event handler shortcuts
[04:07:10] <Cork> .change, .click, .submit...
[04:07:16] <randomguy_> ah
[04:07:43] <Cork> with .on there is little reason to keep them except for compatibility
[04:08:08] <Cork> and on the other hand, there is little reason to remove them except for memory usage
[04:08:28] <Cork> (the functions are auto generated so the amount of code in the js file is tiny)
[04:08:39] <randomguy_> you mean as far as the extra js code for the wrappers
[04:09:15] <flobin> can anyone tell me why $(container).css({"transform": "translate("+lastY+","+lastX+")"}); wouldn‚Äôt work whereas $(container).css({"top": lastY, "left": lastX}); does?
[04:09:19] <Cork> when the browser runs the code generating the function it creates the functions in memory and if called jit code for them
[04:09:23] <flobin> url: http://robinberghuijs.com/ink/proof.html
[04:10:01] <Cork> flobin: console.log("translate("+lastY+","+lastX+")")
[04:10:50] <randomguy_> hmm, might have to look at refactoring my side projects code base to use .on more
[04:10:57] <flobin> ah, missing the percentages
[04:11:03] <flobin> or rather, px
[04:11:27] <flobin> thanks, Cork!
[04:11:39] <Cork> randomguy_: most likely no need
[04:11:53] <Cork> as long as you don't use .live it should be just fine
[04:12:09] <randomguy_> eh, I already need to go back and try to use more delegated event handlers already, :P
[04:12:14] <Cork> randomguy_: the old functions just call into .on anyway
[04:12:16] <flobin> hmm looks like translate is not a very good way to do it
[04:12:29] <Cork> randomguy_: ah, that isn't .on though
[04:12:34] <Cork> randomguy_: that is .delegate
[04:12:49] <Cork> .on is just the new "combine all event handler functions into one"
[04:12:55] <randomguy_> i thought .on('click', '.something', callback) was a delegate?
[04:13:11] <Cork> randomguy_: that is the .on syntax for .delegate ya
[04:13:15] <randomguy_> ah
[04:13:20] <Cork> but the behavior wasn't new to .on
[04:13:52] <Cork> first we had .live, then they wrote a sane implementation of .live as .delegate
[04:14:21] <Cork> and then they removed .live and added .on/.off that do both .bind and .delegate / .unbind and .undelegate
[04:14:52] <Cork> flobin: what are you trying to do?
[04:15:02] <randomguy_> is it preferred to use delegate instead of the combined .on?
[04:15:08] <Cork> no
[04:15:26] <flobin> Cork: well, eventually, I‚Äôm trying to have a grid of images (10x10 for now) that is endlessly scrollable in all directions
[04:15:32] <Cork> randomguy_: you might prefer to use .delegate as you might find the code more readable
[04:15:40] <Cork> randomguy_: but the functions do exactly the same thing
[04:15:42] <randomguy_> gotcha
[04:16:02] <flobin> or it would look like it‚Äôs endlessly scrollable anyway
[04:16:28] <Cork> flobin: what where does translate come into the picture here?
[04:16:47] <flobin> I guess it‚Äôs not really scrolling, but more like panning
[04:17:00] <flobin> I‚Äôm using the translate to pan around the grid in all directions
[04:17:13] <Cork> flobin: you most likely want to create a div with the height you want of the area
[04:17:22] <flobin> I read that it‚Äôs more performant than absolute positioning, so I thought I‚Äôd give it a go, but I think that absolute positioning works better
[04:17:26] <Cork> then position the images inside that div as the user scrolls
[04:17:36] <flobin> yep, that‚Äôs exactly my plan
[04:17:38] <Cork> if you don't do it like that the scroll will behave... "weirdly"
[04:17:56] <Cork> well then you don't need to transform to move the images
[04:18:10] <Cork> just make the div position: relative
[04:18:18] <Cork> and the images position: absolute;
[04:18:30] <flobin> actually on re-reading what you just said my plan is a little bit different
[04:18:56] <Cork> flobin: what you don't want to do is manually moving the images with js
[04:19:10] <Cork> cause that will work really badly on mobile (and future desktop)
[04:19:22] <Cork> as the js scroll is called lazily by the browser there
[04:19:32] <flobin> because I plan to have different grid sizes for different viewport sizes, which is just basic responsive css, so what‚Äôs actually moving is the entire grid, the images will stay in their place in the grid
[04:19:35] <Cork> so the scrolling will look quite bad
[04:20:14] <Cork> flobin: you can do that quite easily with @media or just plain display: flex;
[04:20:25] <flobin> yeah
[04:20:47] <flobin> so the html is just sequences of <figure></figure><figure></figure>, so the grid is all css, basically
[04:21:02] <flobin> so no positioning of individual images in the html
[04:21:20] <flobin> so my plan is to, when you get to an edge, duplicate the entire grid and append it to that direction
[04:21:21] <tuskkk___> why isnt this method POSTing anything http://jsfiddle.net/9zw82hyz/ ?
[04:22:07] <Cork> tuskkk___: 1. retResponse = response; won't work
[04:22:08] <flobin> ‚Ä¶now that I‚Äôve said that, I realize I have no idea of how I would append it to the left or right, as opposed to top/bottom
[04:22:28] <Cork> tuskkk___: the return will execute before the success callback so you will always return null
[04:22:38] <Cork> tuskkk___: 2. about the post, is it cross domain?
[04:22:55] <tuskkk___> Cork: yes, calling php method
[04:23:09] <tuskkk___> Cork: how do I fix the method?
[04:23:27] <Cork> tuskkk___: ok, if you do cors post you have to support answering OPTIONS request serverside
[04:23:30] <Cork> else the browser won't let you
[04:23:42] <Cork> tuskkk___: about the return value, you can't return the value from the callback
[04:23:59] <tuskkk___> and how did you find out return will execute before success?
[04:24:06] <randomguy_> ajax is async
[04:24:15] <randomguy_> by default
[04:24:28] <tuskkk___> Cork: support answering OPTIONS? what is that?
[04:24:35] <Cork> tuskkk___: the best you can do is return the deferred value $.ajax gives you and use scheduleMeeting().done(function(data) { /* code handling the response goes here */ })
[04:24:43] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[04:24:43] <b-ot> Cork: CORS - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[04:24:48] <Cork> tuskkk___: read that ^
[04:25:20] <Cork> randomguy_: and sync is STRONGLY discouraged and only supported for legacy functions
[04:25:29] <Cork> and deprecated in jquery
[04:25:34] <randomguy_> :)
[04:25:57] <Cork> so ya, i would say it isn't an option
[04:26:23] <Cork> tuskkk___: also, unless you use a very old version of jquery this form.attr("disabled", false); won't do what you intend it to do
[04:26:34] <Cork> you want form.prop("disabled", false);
[04:26:35] <randomguy_> if he has a function that can handle the response, he could call that from the success callback, passing in the response
[04:27:07] <Cork> ya, but deferred is easier to get to work with code designed for sync
[04:27:27] <Cork> and normally results in more readable code
[04:27:43] <Cork> ah... i just noticed you use async: false...
[04:28:07] <Cork> tuskkk___: you really, REALLY, _R_E_A_L_L_Y_! should rewrite that
[04:28:58] <tuskkk___> Cork: this isnt my code, I am working on top of it
[04:29:05] <Cork> ouch
[04:29:25] <Cork> tuskkk___: that might might you in a little while though
[04:29:52] <Cork> cause that option is most likely going away in the next major jquery update
[04:30:00] <Cork> (v3)
[04:30:02] <slax0r> Cork: why? what's wrong with it?
[04:30:14] <slax0r> oh, the async thing?
[04:30:17] <Cork> slax0r: it freezes the users entire browser for unknown amount of time?
[04:30:24] <tuskkk___> Cork: what if I just add the ajax submit part inside that onlick event, will I get the response then?
[04:30:44] <slax0r> Cork: i meant his code, what's wrong with it
[04:30:45] <Cork> tuskkk___: no, currently it should work the way it is
[04:30:50] <Cork> i just missed the async: false part
[04:31:04] <Cork> slax0r: cors
[04:31:20] <tuskkk___> Cork: I am taking about the retResponse returning null part
[04:31:21] <Cork> he do post cross domain and the server he posts to doesn't allow cors post
[04:31:36] <Cork> tuskkk___: ya, that isn't a problem; like i said you use async: false
[04:31:42] <Cork> i just missed the use of that legacy option
[04:32:10] <Cork> but keep in mind, it is a bad option
[04:32:17] <tuskkk___> Cork: oh ok, but then why isnt it giving any response?
[04:32:41] <Cork> tuskkk___: flow: 1. you call $.ajax, 2. it triggers an xhr call in the browser
[04:32:43] <slax0r> is the server reached, and returning a response?
[04:32:51] <Cork> 3. the browser calls OPTION <site>
[04:32:55] <Cork> 4. server doesn't respond
[04:33:03] <Cork> 5. browser refuses to do POST <site>
[04:33:22] <tuskkk___> Cork: server is responding, printed a normal word there and it returned fine
[04:33:33] <Cork> tuskkk___: sure, for GET and POST
[04:33:34] <tuskkk___> the problem is nothing gets Posted from this form
[04:33:38] <Cork> not OPTION
[04:34:10] <Cork> OPTION is a verb used for the server to say "yes the script from <site> are allowed to post these values to my post end points"
[04:34:28] <Cork> the link i gave you explains how it works
[04:34:48] <tuskkk___> but this same piece of code works in another similar application, there is no problem of OPTION there
[04:34:50] <Cork> tuskkk___: another option is to post to the same site you load the page from, and have it forward the data to the server
[04:35:05] <Cork> tuskkk___: then it isn't doing cross domain post
[04:35:21] <tuskkk___> I am posting to the same domain only
[04:35:29] <Cork> there you go
[04:35:33] <tuskkk___> its just a different php method
[04:35:40] <Cork> site1 => post site1 : ok
[04:35:45] <Cork> site2 => site1 : not ok
[04:36:05] <tuskkk___> my case is site 1 -> site 1
[04:36:17] <Cork> so two forms loaded from the same site?
[04:36:36] <tuskkk___> yes
[04:36:40] <Cork> as in protocol://fqdn:port are all the same
[04:36:53] <tuskkk___> yes
[04:37:11] <Cork> uh.. you said it was cross domain when i asked a while back -_-'
[04:37:21] <Cork> sigh
[04:37:39] <tuskkk___> I am sorry for that, didnt understand it then properly
[04:37:48] <tuskkk___> read that article and got it now
[04:37:53] <tuskkk___> my apologies
[04:38:18] <Cork> tuskkk___: do you get any network calls at all?
[04:38:39] <Cork> (check the browsers dev console)
[04:38:41] <tuskkk___> yes, it reaches the controller action fine
[04:38:58] <Cork> no in the page is it actually triggering a network call?
[04:39:00] <tuskkk___> but POST and Response are empty
[04:39:16] <randomguy_> so here's something, might be me being stupid.  in the beforeSend it disables the form.  are you able to serialize on a disabled form, or does the serialize happen before that block of code?
[04:39:23] <tuskkk___> one sec
[04:40:12] <tuskkk___> Cork: yes network calls triggering fine
[04:40:17] <Cork> ok
[04:40:59] <Cork> and if you check the response body in the console the expected content is in there?
[04:41:36] <tuskkk___> Cork: no, its empty
[04:41:48] <Cork> ok, if you check the request for the call
[04:41:54] <Cork> is the parameters you expect in there?
[04:42:25] <tuskkk___> Cork: nope, Post block is empty
[04:42:38] <tuskkk___> there are only Headers
[04:42:40] <Cork> ok
[04:42:49] <Cork> if you do console.log(form.serialize() before the ajax call
[04:42:56] <Cork> do you see what you expect in the console?
[04:43:18] <Cork> if no i would expect var form = $('#schedule-meeting') in the click handler is the problem
[04:43:34] <Cork> that it for example doesn't find the form
[04:43:51] <tuskkk___> let me do them, brb
[04:46:21] <randomguy_> technically line 5 isn't needed also.
[04:46:50] <Cork> ya
[04:47:22] <Cork> randomguy_: also if the code is this isolated you could remove the async: false part and make this a bit less ugly
[04:47:41] <Cork> ugg wrong nick
[04:47:43] <Cork> tuskkk___: ^
[04:49:53] <randomguy_> is that true though?  can you serialize on a disabled form?  i know if you disable a form element and do an old style form submit, those elements will be excluded
[04:50:41] <Cork> as far as i know disabled on the <form> tag doesn't do anything
[04:50:54] <Cork> only disable on the submit button actually block submit
[04:51:18] <Cork> i remember doing that mistake my self several years back :)
[04:51:48] <Cork> and then implementing js code to check for the disable attribute to actually block the submit...
[04:52:03] <Cork> aaaand, then just move the disabled to the submit button and everything else could be removed :)
[04:53:18] <hollusion> hi guys, i am using css to colorize odd/even rows in a table. how can i make the browser redraw those styles after sorting with ui-sortables?
[04:53:52] <Cork> hollusion: if you use :nth-child(odd)/:nth-child(even) you don't need to
[04:53:58] <Cork> it should just work on it's own
[04:54:37] <Cork> though that won't work in older ie( ie<=8 i think)
[04:55:05] <Cork> yup
[04:55:14] <Cork> works in ie9+
[04:55:27] <kfp> Hi, I have created a form and validated it using Javascript but now I am required to do the same with Jquery but I am struggling a bit
[04:55:32] <kfp> Here is my code, http://jsfiddle.net/tgxbdg2n/
[04:56:10] <kfp> Am I doing something stupid? I thought the (document).ready would load the jq as soon as I load the page
[04:57:09] <Cork> updated to actually load the needed js: http://jsfiddle.net/tgxbdg2n/1/
[04:57:22] <hollusion> Cork: you are talking about letting the browser do the odd/even coloring? what if i want other colors?
[04:57:43] <Cork> kfp:} email: { <-- you miss the , before email:
[04:58:46] <Cork> kfp: http://jsfiddle.net/tgxbdg2n/2/
[04:58:57] <Cork> hollusion: its a selector
[04:59:03] <Cork> you do the coloring just like today
[04:59:22] <Cork> table tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: blue; }
[04:59:41] <hollusion> Cork: oh i misunderstood yoiur first response, i am indeed already using that selector
[04:59:53] <Cork> hollusion: in css or with .css?
[04:59:54] <hollusion> but after sorting the colors get messed up
[04:59:58] <hollusion> in css
[05:00:10] <Cork> then you get extra elements in the table
[05:00:20] <Cork> (or what ever it is you're sorting)
[05:00:21] <hollusion> checking
[05:00:57] <kfp> what did you change for it to actually load the needed js?
[05:01:22] <randomguy_> kfp: additional resources on the LHS
[05:01:22] <Cork> kfp: i added them to "external resources"
[05:01:32] <Cork> and picked jquery in the dropdown
[05:01:56] <kfp> Ah I see now :) Apologies but this was my first time using jsfiddle
[05:02:07] <Cork> ya, i guessed that :)
[05:02:25] <kfp> Is there something wrong with my jquery then? as it still isn't working even after adding the missing ,
[05:03:09] <Cork> kfp: the input fields are missing name=""
[05:03:17] <Cork> so ya, hard to validate elements that doesn't exist
[05:03:27] <Cork> id != name
[05:03:41] <kfp> I thought it validated using the ID not the name
[05:03:46] <Cork> nope
[05:04:04] <Cork> so the only field validating is title
[05:04:07] <Cork> but it always have a value
[05:04:29] <kfp> because it counts title as a value
[05:04:53] <Cork> well more cause you set value="default"
[05:05:01] <Cork> if you set value="" it would complain
[05:05:45] <kfp> I can't believe I have been sitting here for so long trying to figure out why it wouldn't work -_-. Thanks so much!
[05:05:53] <Cork> :)
[05:06:32] <kfp> So you are always calling upon elements in jq using the names of them not the id
[05:07:04] <randomguy_> kinda a broad statement, in jq you can reference them either way
[05:07:39] <randomguy_> just in that case, it seems, it wants names, :)
[05:07:40] <kfp> okay, but when using the validation plugin it is names
[05:08:43] <randomguy_> also without names, i'm not sure how the back end would know what was what on the submit
[05:12:21] <kfp> I have made the changes locally and the validation isn't working. I assume this must mean that I am not correctly linking to the pluggins right?
[05:12:52] <kfp> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[05:12:52] <kfp>    <script src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.13.1/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>
[05:12:52] <kfp>    <script src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.13.1/additional-methods.min.js"></script>
[05:12:55] <randomguy_> check your network tab and see if all resources are being pulled in
[05:13:51] <Cork> kfp: the loading is correct (just not for jsfiddle)
[05:15:37] <kfp> What else could be causing it not to work in my browser but still on jfiddle? I made the same changes
[05:16:07] <Cork> start by checking that the selector actually find the form
[05:16:15] <Cork> (so it doesn't run before the dom is ready)
[05:16:30] <Cork> uh.. scratch that
[05:16:53] <Cork> you have it wrapped in .ready already >_>
[05:17:18] <Cork> kfp: check so you don't use the id on more then one place i guess might be a cause
[05:17:57] <kfp> I have made the name the same as the id, worked on jsfiddle but would that cause it?
[05:18:11] <Cork> no
[05:18:21] <kfp> I didn't think so
[05:18:24] <Cork> having ids with the same value as the name is perfectly ok
[05:25:33] <kfp> The only difference is the css so I removed that but still not luck
[05:26:06] <Cork> and no errors in the browsers console?
[05:26:58] <kfp> ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[05:26:58] <kfp> 	
[05:26:58] <kfp> $(document).ready(function() {
[05:27:28] <Cork> so your link for jquery fail to load
[05:27:41] <sammich> you'll have to barter for it
[05:28:11] <kfp> I found the link in the google library
[05:28:32] <sammich> damn, I thought that was the cleverest thing I've said all day.
[05:28:37] <Cork> "404. Thatís an error. "
[05:29:23] <Cork> kfp: they don't host 1.11.2
[05:29:33] <Cork> hmm no they do
[05:30:12] <Cork> uhh... most have typed wrong it loads now
[05:31:52] <kfp> shall I try another version from there?
[05:32:05] <Cork> i would recommend using code.jquery.com
[05:32:23] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js
[05:33:25] <kfp> Still giving me the same error in console
[05:33:58] <Cork> kfp: and the <script> tag is before the script where you try to use it?
[05:34:59] <kfp> Yeah, I have 4 seperate script tags, one to link the the js page and 3 for the jq and pluggins
[05:35:21] <kfp> here is the one for jq
[05:35:22] <Cork> kfp: in that order?
[05:35:22] <kfp> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
[05:35:31] <Cork> cause that would explain the problem
[05:35:42] <kfp> js, jq, validate, additional methods
[05:35:51] <Cork> ok, so ya there is you're problem
[05:35:58] <cyberbrai> How can i create the class diagram and sequence diagram in java
[05:36:00] <kfp> fuck, I need to load the jq before I load the js page
[05:36:03] <Cork> dependencies have to loaded before you can use them
[05:36:29] <kfp> Cork, I appreciate your patience my friend
[05:36:40] <Cork> cyberbrai: uh... how is that related to the topic?
[05:36:52] <cyberbrai> sorry not java js
[05:37:19] <Cork> cyberbrai: and what is "class diagram"?
[05:37:29] <Cork> or "sequence diagram" for that matter
[05:37:46] <cyberbrai> Cork don't know about that then sorry for asking that question
[05:38:05] <Cork> O_o'
[05:38:07] <kfp> I have used violet to create a class diagram
[05:38:23] <Cork> cyberbrai: i have a problem do you know how to solve it? (how could anyone answer that?)
[05:38:50] <Cork> are you talking about creating a plot diagram?
[05:38:58] <Cork> or what are you actually asking about?
[05:40:06] <cyberbrai> class diagram to show relationship
[05:40:28] <kfp> you can use this UML editor: http://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/
[05:40:44] <Cork> so... you're asking for a graphical construction?
[05:40:52] <kfp> it's free and pretty simple, there are some guides online
[05:40:55] <Cork> that was kinda the context i asked for
[05:41:21] <Cork> cause ya, there are plenty of those
[05:42:14] <cyberbrai> kfp i can create class or sequence class in it
[05:43:30] <kfp> You can create class diagrams in it yeah
[05:44:27] <cyberbrai> what about sequence diagram
[05:45:09] <kfp> Yup
[05:46:33] <cyberbrai> can i create or not
[05:47:00] <kfp> I answered, Yes you can create both a class and sequence diagram
[05:47:45] <cyberbrai> kfp thank you so much
[05:48:28] <kfp> No worries
[05:55:35] <Matt__> hey all, Wondering if anyone can help me... I'm trying to add functionality to a pre-built crm without editing any of there core code so I want to try and detect when a hidden input box is changed (already by jquery) and .on('change') doesn't seem to trigger anything
[05:56:21] <Matt__> the core function runs for example $("#element').val('hello this is a value'); and i want to detect when #element is changed
[05:58:37] <MeiR-> Matt__, what can change that input?
[05:59:03] <MeiR-> the change event cannot listen to changes that were made by a script, only by user
[05:59:07] <Matt__> it's changed by the on close of a popup window
[05:59:20] <Matt__> but i can't hook into that function
[05:59:39] <Matt__> Is there something else rather than change i can use?
[05:59:47] <MeiR-> so i'm afraid you can't trigger a change event
[05:59:50] <notchris> Good morning all
[06:00:22] <MeiR-> Matt__, why can't you modify the on close?
[06:01:02] <Matt__> Because I'm making a custom addon to a CRM, the on close is in the core functionality not the custom functionality
[06:01:23] <Matt__> and the core functionality get's updated nightly by the crm developers
[06:01:38] <Matt__> thus would make my code get overwritten
[06:01:39] <MeiR-> well, you cannot change all actions that the CRM does without modifying it a bit
[06:02:04] <ajf-> I am using this code to set up some changes on a site: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/52d0f42156d7ce6fe36c. I want to use jQuery 1.11.2 there, so notice the way I am saving whatever jQuery was before in prevjQuery in line 2, and then setting it back to normal in line 172. However the site owners are saying that this is breaking some sliders and stuff.
[06:02:07] <ajf-> What am I doing wrong?
[06:02:21] <bepolite> morning notchris
[06:02:21] <ajf-> Am I not saving and restoring the previous jQuery object the way it's supposed to ?
[06:02:23] <MeiR-> Matt__, you can set an intval
[06:02:32] <notchris> bepolite: Morning :D
[06:02:49] <MeiR-> interval*
[06:07:48] <Matt__> MeiR-: I would set an interval but it's a really hack solution for a professional piece of software
[06:13:53] <Cork> ajf-: you shouldn't reset $
[06:14:04] <ajf-> why ?
[06:14:17] <Cork> cause noConflict will do that already
[06:14:44] <Cork> also noConflict is for conflict management of other frameworks
[06:14:59] <Cork> it doesn't really work well for multiple versions of jquery
[06:15:06] <ajf-> so what's the proper way to do this then?
[06:15:13] <Cork> (as they all depend on the current jQuery global object)
[06:15:27] <Cork> ajf-: i would recommend "pick one jquery version and use that"
[06:16:40] <Cork> ajf-: cause for example, jquery plugins you load will only exist the the jquery instance that currently happen to own window.jQuery
[06:16:54] <Cork> ajf-: and only way to semi get around that would be to patch the plugins
[06:18:12] <ajf-> Cork, yes, but I'm saving jQuery and $ in some variables, then calling my function as an IIFE with the new jQuery as $, and restoring the old objects immediately.
[06:18:20] <ajf-> so any plugin will get the old version
[06:18:37] <ajf-> see this updated gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4af7851f9d919d939379
[06:18:50] <Cork> except you call it in reverse
[06:18:54] <ajf-> note I'm not using noConflict(true) anymore
[06:19:01] <Cork> so you destroy the jquery reference
[06:19:21] <Cork> what you want to do is call noConflict() after loading your jquery instance
[06:19:35] <Cork> ajf-: but again, i would recommend not doing this
[06:19:53] <ajf-> there's a problem there. This thing is apparently loading the <script> tag automatically in async mode
[06:20:06] <ajf-> that's the reason for the timeouts in L:159
[06:20:20] <Cork> that would just make the code racy
[06:20:30] <Cork> setTimeout is a bad idea for getting around async
[06:20:46] <Cork> try to see if you can find a callback or event you can use instead
[06:21:09] <ajf-> and... about loading multiple jQueries....
[06:21:26] <ajf-> the thing is that this is actually a script for a split test. It's loaded through some tool called VWO
[06:21:36] <ajf-> you cannot rely on the host site to have or not have jQuery
[06:21:43] <ajf-> you have to load your own version and use it
[06:21:53] <ajf-> that's the reason for all the saving and restoring
[06:21:56] <Cork> ajf-: you could check if it has jquery and use that if it exist
[06:22:03] <Cork> and if it doesn't load your own
[06:22:11] <Cork> it is much safer then loading multiple instances
[06:22:33] <ajf-> but then what happens if the site uses 1.6.5 or something like that?
[06:22:59] <Cork> as long as you use things like .bind instead of .on and so on
[06:23:06] <Cork> you should be safe as long as they have 1.5+
[06:23:24] <Cork> it isn't that hard to write a jquery script that has quite long compatibility range
[06:25:52] <ajf-> I'm still confused as to why this isn't something that would work fine: oldjQuery = jQuery; old$ = $; // get new jQuery; (function($) { .. })(jQuery); jQuery = oldjQuery; $ = old$;
[06:26:19] <Cork> ajf-: for one the async thing would be a worry for me
[06:26:34] <Cork> cause that can mean you don't control the order of when things load
[06:26:46] <Cork> especially the setTimeout
[06:27:23] <adv_> can you recommend a lib/plugin for webrtc voice chat?
[06:29:15] <ajf-> Cork, but if everything was synchronous (forget async), that is not something that would create problems right ?
[06:29:20] <ajf-> I mean, this is just javascript
[06:29:38] <ajf-> I can juggle with the jQuery objects and point them to other objects, restore them, etc. without problems
[06:29:58] <ajf-> I won't lose anything, no?
[06:30:34] <Cork> ajf-: i would avoid doing the resetting you do to start with
[06:30:40] <Cork> cause jquery is meant to handle that it self
[06:31:41] <Cork> ajf-: and resetting it before loading jquery might break things, not sure
[06:32:25] <Cork> i usually have control of the projects i work with so i basically forbid things that would require the use of noConflict
[06:33:22] <ajf-> Cork: alright, well thanks for the input. I might rewrite this to use the old jQuery if it keeps presenting issues.
[06:50:26] <jmdrawneek> Please can someone point me in the right direct to debug an issue. I've noticed jquery colorbox occasionally fails to load properly. I don't get any errors in console so have no idea how track a issue like that?
[06:51:29] <Cork> jmdrawneek: sounds like a likely race condition
[06:51:51] <Cork> where something is dynamically added and a timer or something like that tries to access it
[06:52:13] <jmdrawneek> Oh right.
[06:52:16] <Cork> but sometimes it takes longer to load so the selector finds nothing (and this doesn't cause any error or anything like that)
[06:52:44] <jmdrawneek> The weirdest thing is that it doesn't happen every time. On the same links + conditions
[06:53:04] <Cork> that is basically a perfect description of race
[06:53:11] <jmdrawneek> So I could do with trying to extend the timeout?
[06:53:28] <Cork> no you shouldn't use a timeout at all
[06:53:32] <Cork> you should use callbacks
[06:53:50] <Cork> timers is always a bad idea, unless you set it on a few days
[06:54:01] <Cork> cause sleep and what not might break the assumption
[07:01:40] <kfp> If i wanted to validate a textbox for ZHA12456 where the digits can be any random 6. Would the best way be to create my own method using $.validator.addMethod and then use that method in my rules?
[07:03:30] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Thanks for that ‚Äì I'll get reading up on callbacks
[07:03:37] <jmdrawneek> Cork++
[07:03:57] <Cork> jmdrawneek: you might want to check up on $.Callbacks and $.deferred too

[07:08:01] <flobin> anyone have any idea why the left might work, but the top doesn‚Äôt? https://gist.github.com/Flobin/c54db25669a45b929135
[07:08:36] <bewilled> Hey, I've got an add on a Jquery Mobile footer that disapears on each page transition, If ajax is disabled this doesn't happen. What could be happening?
[07:08:59] <Cork> flobin: again, check what values you actually get
[07:09:17] <flobin> Cork: heh, one of these days I‚Äôll learn to do that before I ask
[07:09:20] <flobin> but yes, thanks
[07:10:01] <adv_> can you recommend a lib/plugin for webrtc voice chat?
[07:10:31] <Cork> i doubt very much you will find a plugin or even a lib for that
[07:10:47] <Cork> it is usually much more involved then that (basically a full site)
[07:12:28] <flobin> obviously I am doing something wrong because top is [object Window], but I don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm actually doing wrong
[07:13:03] <Cork> ah
[07:13:10] <Cork> flobin: are you setting those values in global?
[07:13:24] <Cork> cause if you do you are actually modifying window.height :)
[07:13:51] <flobin> er‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I am, but I‚Äôm not sure I understand what you mean
[07:13:52] <Cork> flobin: i would recommend wrapping this code in a scope (function() {})();
[07:14:11] <flobin> ah, right
[07:14:15] <Cork> flobin: if the link you gave is the hole file, then yes you are
[07:14:57] <flobin> oh great, it works now
[07:15:03] <flobin> so is top a reserved word?
[07:15:12] <Cork> flobin: no not reserved
[07:15:13] <flobin> or why is it that I‚Äôm setting the window.height?
[07:15:16] <Cork> ya
[07:15:37] <Cork> var height = something; in the global scope is the same thing as setting window.height
[07:15:45] <Cork> (and that is just ignored)
[07:15:52] <Cork> anyway gtg
[07:19:13] <flobin> oh I see
[07:19:14] <flobin> thanks!
[07:37:32] <Sal> hi
[07:37:43] <Sal> can someone tell me whats wrong with this line:
[07:37:47] <Sal> $(document).on('click', '.m-form-group input["data-app"]', lookupClick);
[07:38:16] <Sal> click aint fireing on input
[07:39:34] <Sal> is the part with input[...] syntax correct?
[07:40:44] <Cork> Sal: remove the double quotes
[07:41:02] <Sal> damn! thanks Cork
[07:41:02] <Cork> attribute names shouldn't be quoted
[07:41:34] <Cork> (they can't ever contain </> or space anyway so no need to
[07:42:30] <Sal> Cirk, one more thing.... whats the best way to have different <a> in a page? i mean each that calls different functions
[07:42:43] <Sal> i was first using the onclick directly on the <a>
[07:42:53] <Sal> but they told me that its bad to do it that way
[07:43:14] <Sal> so, should i add a different class to every <a>?
[07:43:19] <Sal> or is it better to use data or attributes
[07:43:54] <Sal> something like: <a addrow>click to add</a>
[07:44:26] <Sal> i could have more than 1 addrow link in a page, so i can't use ids
[07:44:26] <Cork> Sal: <a> should be used for links
[07:44:31] <Cork> not actions
[07:44:39] <Sal> i'm using it for buttons
[07:44:41] <Cork> <button> is a better choice for actions
[07:44:47] <Sal> hmmm
[07:45:01] <Cork> (you can style it to look like a link if you like)
[07:45:18] <Sal> was thinking the same
[07:45:30] <Cork> Sal: basically, <a> should always have a href pointing to a server destination that exists
[07:45:36] <Sal> anyway, what to use to distinguish all the buttons
[07:45:38] <Cork> (and does what it is you're doing)
[07:46:06] <Sal> ah, now i remember why i'm using the <a>
[07:46:14] <Sal> for deep linking
[07:46:26] <Cork> deep linking?
[07:46:34] <Sal> usually, the <a> opens a popup or a side panel
[07:47:04] <Cork> i don't see why that means they have to be a broken <a> tag
[07:47:06] <Sal> so, when i need a href="#openSlide"
[07:47:12] <Cork> ah
[07:47:30] <Cork> and you support #openSlide urls?
[07:47:32] <Sal> for the damn smartphone browser
[07:47:32] <Sal> :)
[07:47:39] <Sal> yes
[07:47:44] <Cork> ok, then it is perfectly valid
[07:47:57] <Cork> (nice to see for once!)
[07:48:23] <Cork> ok so you could just check the attr('href') ?
[07:48:40] <Cork> wouldn't that be a good way to handle what should happen?
[07:49:09] <Sal> oh, yes, thats right
[07:49:09] <Sal> didn't think of that
[07:49:36] <Sal> but its can't be a direct query
[07:50:05] <Cork> you could either bind a delegated selector for href starting with #
[07:50:12] <Cork> or you could give the links a class and use th
[07:50:16] <Cork> *at
[07:50:35] <Sal> ok, thanks
[07:50:39] <Sal> nice ideas you have me
[07:50:45] <Sal> i'll take a deeper look at it
[07:51:00] <Sal> gave=gave
[07:51:22] <Sal> have=gave
[07:51:27] <Cork> :)
[07:51:28] <Sal> fkg eyes
[07:54:15] <kokut> Hello, anyone tried this https://github.com/sathomas/acc-wizard its an accordion for bootstrap
[07:54:26] <kokut> it's not working and i don't know how to debug it at all
[08:35:23] <misutowolf> Got a question.   What's the easiest way to take a string like this:  "3 Mana Confluence" and see if the first "word" is a number?
[08:35:39] <robertmaxrees> split on spaces, then parseInt()
[08:35:39] <kokut> Hello, Is there any conflict-free old jquery (1.1 ~ 1.7)  accordion plugin? I've tried http://sathomas.me/acc-wizard/ but it doesn't work
[08:36:24] <robertmaxrees> kokut that plugin requires bootstrap 3, which probably needs a semi-recent version of jquery
[08:36:28] <misutowolf> Hmm.   That could definitely work.   I need to take just the first part, and ignore the rest.  I also want to allow for like
[08:36:33] <misutowolf> 3x Mana Confluence
[08:36:38] <misutowolf> (the x existing)
[08:36:48] <misutowolf> But yeah, the parseint thing definitely works.
[08:36:54] <kokut> robertmaxrees: yea, u know any other plugins i can try?
[08:37:03] <kokut> i really need this thing working asap
[08:37:32] <robertmaxrees> kokut not for such an old version of JQ.
[08:37:38] <Cork> misutowolf: or you could use //.test()
[08:37:46] <robertmaxrees> find a modern one and look for older versions through github, kokut
[08:37:57] <kokut> robertmaxrees: how?
[08:37:58] <robertmaxrees> misutowolf what do you need that first number for?
[08:38:19] <Cork> misutowolf: /^[0-9]+/.test(string)
[08:38:39] <robertmaxrees> kokut how what?
[08:38:40] <misutowolf> I'm writing a little application for a javascript class that deals with Magic the Gathering
[08:38:53] <misutowolf> so it's the number of copies of a card in a deck
[08:39:10] <kokut> robertmaxrees: how to look for older versions through github?
[08:39:55] <robertmaxrees> kokut there's a "branch" dropdown - you can usually find older versions through that.
[08:40:20] <kokut> robertmaxrees: well u know any with recent versions ?
[08:40:39] <robertmaxrees> kokut nope.
[08:41:15] <Cork> kokut: you mean an example or a specific project?
[08:41:29] <robertmaxrees> he's looking for an accordion plugin that works with old jquery
[08:41:34] <Cork> ah
[08:41:49] <robertmaxrees> like, 1.1 to 1.7
[08:41:59] <Cork> wow
[08:42:07] <Cork> well 1.1 is really old
[08:42:10] <robertmaxrees> very
[08:42:20] <Cork> 1.7 should be fine
[08:42:31] <robertmaxrees> 1.7 is before the 1.9 break.
[08:42:51] <robertmaxrees> so i get the feeling it'll be challenging.
[08:43:01] <Cork> 1.7 should be doable
[08:43:01] <kokut> Cork: yea i need an accordion i can try
[08:43:15] <Cork> kokut: what about the jquery ui one?
[08:43:16] * misutowolf ponders.
[08:43:29] <Cork> ?g jquery ui accordion
[08:43:33] <b-ot> Cork: Accordion | jQuery UI ‚Üí https://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[08:43:38] <kokut> cork lemme try it
[08:43:53] <Cork> they have ones that works back to 1.3 at least
[08:44:00] <Cork> or wait 1.2.x
[08:44:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah you could go for an older jqui version.
[08:44:11] <Cork> ya
[08:44:20] <robertmaxrees> kokut what's with the random version range?  why 1.1 to 1.7?
[08:44:34] <Cork> 1.1 is very old ya
[08:44:48] <Cork> 1.5 - 1.7 would be more understandable
[08:44:52] <kokut> robertmaxrees: yea
[08:45:08] <robertmaxrees> 1.5-1.7 doesn't make sense either - why is there a range for versions?
[08:45:28] <Cork> sites that isn't updated
[08:45:29] <Cork> i guess
[08:45:30] <samssh> misutowolf, You can also match the string on /^\d/
[08:46:08] <samssh> Oh, didn't see that cork had that already up there.
[08:46:36] <samssh> (And I missed the +.
[08:46:39] <samssh> )
[08:47:04] <Cork> well the plus is kinda meaning less
[08:47:22] <Cork> if the first character is a number so will "all numbers following it" so... :)
[08:47:42] <samssh> True
[08:48:44] <kokut> which files of jquery UI do i have to include?
[08:48:59] <kokut> because it comes with a lot of files
[08:49:06] <robertmaxrees> at least the minified JS.
[08:49:16] <robertmaxrees> if you want the default styles, the CSS as well.
[08:50:03] <Cork> kokut: if you mean component accordion depends on widget and core
[08:50:45] <Cork> robertmaxrees: there is actually a minimal css you need just to get jquery ui to work correctly
[08:51:01] <Cork> (that is behavior not style)
[08:51:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware.
[08:51:26] <robertmaxrees> but their question is ephemeral: are they using a minimal build of JQUI? or did they just download the entire thing?
[08:51:37] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it's the former.
[08:52:44] <robertmaxrees> err, latter.  not former.  i am tired.
[08:53:10] <Cork> i wish ui had a better "required jquery version" then read the blog...
[08:53:25] <Cork> (for old versions)
[08:54:46] <samssh> Cork, How long has it been available in Bower?
[08:55:06] <Cork> bower?
[08:55:22] <samssh> Yeah, the bower.json file lists the dependencies.
[08:55:24] <robertmaxrees> looks like since roughly 1.11.1
[08:55:29] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/bower/
[08:55:29] <kokut> jQuery( "#accordion" ).accordion(); => undefined is not a function, $( "#accordion" ).accordion(); => cannot read propperty 'accordion' of null :\
[08:55:44] <kokut> da fuq is going on
[08:55:47] <Cork> samssh: never even seen that before so
[08:55:51] <robertmaxrees> kokut make sure you have jquery loaded, and then jquery ui.
[08:57:30] <kokut> robertmaxrees: yea i have jquery-ui loaded after jQuery
[08:57:49] <robertmaxrees> and it's successfully loading?  no 404 in your network tab?
[08:57:56] <kokut> nope, its loaded
[08:58:17] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[08:58:27] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you type $.fn.accordion in your console?
[08:58:51] <kokut> i just find out my theme already includes jquery-ui so i removed the one i added, the error is undefined is not a function when i use jQuery and accordion is null when i use $
[08:58:53] <kokut> lemme try
[08:59:13] <kokut> $.fn.accordion => cannot read propperty 'accordion' of undefined
[08:59:22] <Cork> ah
[08:59:29] <Cork> try jQuery.fn.accordion
[08:59:37] <kokut> undefined
[08:59:44] <robertmaxrees> jquery jQuery.fn.jquery
[08:59:55] <robertmaxrees> woops haha drop that first one - try just jQuery.fn.jquery
[09:00:08] <kokut> 1.7.1
[09:00:16] <robertmaxrees> jqui isn't loading then.
[09:00:17] <Cork> and... jquery.ui.version i think it was
[09:00:23] <Cork> jQuery.ui.version
[09:00:34] <kokut> 1.11.0
[09:00:41] <kokut> maybe the theme didnt include the accordion?
[09:00:46] <Cork> ya
[09:00:56] <samssh> I hate floats
[09:01:07] <kokut> can i  just include it again after the theme included it? :\
[09:01:12] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:01:17] <robertmaxrees> that'll cause bigger problems.
[09:01:18] <kokut> if i have to find where this thing was included i will have a hard time man
[09:01:30] <Cork> kokut: you can include just the accordion part
[09:01:36] <kokut> u know whats the file structure of magento? :\
[09:01:44] <kokut> that sounds nice
[09:01:53] <Cork> just make sure you match the ui version
[09:02:17] <kokut> its kind of what i tried, didnt check the version tho
[09:02:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?  "kind of what i tried"?
[09:03:01] <kokut> yea i downloaded only the accordion from the jquery-ui
[09:03:13] <kokut> with all the effects tho
[09:03:43] <kokut> there is not a 1.11.0 jquery-ui, only 1.11.4 or 1.10.4
[09:04:28] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to use 1.11.4.
[09:04:37] <robertmaxrees> that supports jquery 1.6+ iirc
[09:04:43] <Cork> kokut: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1.11.0/ui/accordion.js
[09:05:34] <kokut> Cork: k gonna try inlcuding only that
[09:12:49] <kokut> woot, it kinda works! lol
[09:12:58] <kokut> the animation at least, now i need to fix the style
[09:13:06] <kokut> tyvm cork, robertmaxrees
[09:41:16] <kokut> i have a lil problem, the accordion is givin 155px height to all the containers and if i add more stuff inside of the container it will be hidden :\
[09:42:02] <coder7of9> in datepicker i assign a function the beforeShowDay. How do I get a handle to "this" in my function. where this is the class which contains the datepicker constructor and the assign function for beforeShowDay
[09:42:27] <coder7of9> *assigned
[09:43:49] <adv_> how can i dynamically execute a js script from within script tags?
[09:43:49] <adv_> the equivalent of script src=""
[09:44:13] <Cork> ?api getScript
[09:44:13] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[09:44:18] <Cork> ?api jquery.getScript
[09:44:19] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.getScript(): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[09:46:24] <coder7of9> trying to get a localscope for "this"    http://pastebin.com/k4vzx8S4
[09:47:07] <sim642> I'm using .change on radio inputs and it's driving me completely mad, when I $('input:checked') inside the event listener then it returns two inputs: the old and the new one... How am I supposed to even do anything useful with it?
[09:47:11] <coder7of9> oh wait... easy as pie
[09:47:49] <coder7of9> context: this,  Thanks!
[09:47:58] <Cork> coder7of9: javascript loses the connection to the object when you pass it as reference
[09:48:12] <Cork> that is where that problem comes from
[09:48:19] <randomguy_> sim642: try $(this)
[09:48:38] <kokut> Cork: the containers inside the accordion are given 155px height each and some of them need a bigger height and some a lesser height, do you know where can i fix this?
[09:49:02] <sim642> randomguy_, I can't simply use it like that because from the listener I need to call other functions in which I need to find the radio that's checked
[09:49:06] <Cork> kokut: just guessing, but i would suspect a max-height in the css
[09:49:10] <sim642> it's in those functions where I can't determine it...
[09:49:49] <Cork> kokut: also https://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-heightStyle
[09:49:54] <randomguy_> sim642 radio button?  you can probably use .val() off of their name or whatever to get which one is currently selected
[09:50:00] <kokut> Cork: i think the proble its that is using outerHeight that's completely broken
[09:50:26] <kokut> i used it for one of my projects and it gave a different value every time i refreshed the page
[09:50:27] <sim642> randomguy_, but I don't know which of the inputs is selected, each one of them has a value
[09:50:37] <Cork> kokut: check the link
[09:50:44] <randomguy_> sim642 right, but they both have the same name/id correct?
[09:51:18] <randomguy_> sim642 should be name i believe
[09:51:42] <Cork> ya two elements with the same id isn't valid
[09:51:46] <randomguy_> sim642 so $('[name=whatever]').val() should tell you which one is selected
[09:51:59] <Cork> * $('[name="whatever"]')
[09:52:00] <sim642> how would that selector even work
[09:52:07] <Cork> always quote attribute values
[09:52:12] <randomguy_> there ya go
[09:52:34] <Cork> also you want input in there
[09:52:47] <Cork> $('input[name="whatever"]')
[09:53:39] <sim642> wouldn't it just select all the inputs regardless if their checked state?
[09:53:42] <kokut> Cork: wow it worked
[09:53:50] <kokut> Cork: ty man, i owe u
[09:54:03] <randomguy_> sim642 no, the name="whatever" part would get only your targeted radios with that name
[09:54:32] <sim642> with that name, but all the radios have that name
[09:54:43] <sim642> shouldn't there be like :checked or something?
[09:54:45] <randomguy_> sim642 then .val() tells you which one is selected
[09:55:01] <sim642> but all my radios have values
[09:55:19] <randomguy_> sim642 but since only one can be chosen at a given time, it will only have one value
[09:55:30] <randomguy_> sim642 think of each radio as a state of the variable
[09:56:14] <sim642> the selector selects all the inputs with that name, how will .val() magically return the value of the right one magically?
[09:56:38] <randomguy_> sim642 the value of the variable will be the value of the radio currently selected
[09:58:04] <sim642> umm no, I just get the first radio value regardless of what is actually selected
[09:58:17] <randomguy_> hmm
[09:59:17] <Cork> randomguy_: no it won't
[09:59:32] <Cork> .val() only gives you the value of the selected radio element
[09:59:45] <Cork> so yes you want :selected
[10:00:15] <Cork> uh... sorry :checked >_<'
[10:00:34] <Cork> $('input[name="whatever"]:checked')
[10:00:53] <randomguy_> dang
[10:00:56] <Cork> and if you want to check if a specific element is the selected one
[10:01:02] <sim642> yeah that's what I actually had in the beginning but my problem wasn't even there
[10:01:13] <Cork> you use $('input[name=""][value=""]').prop('checked')
[10:01:14] <sim642> what caused all the issues was not having names on the radios
[10:01:28] <Cork> ya
[10:01:36] <sim642> and I didn't realize it'd be any issue because visually the bootstrap fancy radio thing worked just fine
[10:01:37] <Cork> radio elements depends on the name attribute
[10:01:45] <sim642> it only failed during the change event
[10:03:30] <randomguy_> my bad, :(
[10:20:14] <Syco54645> i am trying to figure out a way to accomplish this goal. i am using the jquery input mask and only want to format US numbers and leave everything else alone. I guess I need to remove the input mask at a certain point.
[10:34:33] <Perseus0> hey
[10:35:46] <robertmaxrees> hello Perseus0!
[10:35:54] <Perseus0> I'm doing jquery function using mouseenter and mouseout to make css changes
[10:36:00] <Perseus0> hello robertmaxrees
[10:36:16] <Perseus0> but it highlights all the items, i have a slideshow
[10:37:08] <Perseus0> if in css I did  .item:hover{ background-color:black;} it would only target the item being hovered on
[10:37:29] <robertmaxrees> you can addClass() to $(this).
[10:37:44] <robertmaxrees> depending on how you're binding that listener.
[10:38:11] <jfive> i bet seeing code would provide more insight :)
[10:38:19] <Perseus0> i will send you a bin, it's only css changes but i can't do it in css because i have to bind multiple classes
[10:38:31] <Perseus0> yes indeed jfive thanks robertmaxrees
[10:38:40] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 a functioning fiddle would be preferred.
[10:39:44] <Perseus0> oh sorry but that would take a lot more time sorry because it needs the owl carousel library etc
[10:39:53] <Perseus0> http://laravel.io/bin/d9W1P robertmaxrees jfive
[10:39:55] <robertmaxrees> you can add that to the fiddle.
[10:40:14] <Perseus0> oh ok, let me do that then
[10:40:19] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the HTML, it's hard to help.
[10:40:53] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/T1RcqlD.png is where you add the third party lib.
[10:41:40] <Perseus0> thank you
[10:48:24] <Perseus0> robertmaxrees:  can you add js files to jfiddle
[10:48:38] <Perseus0> because it seems there's no URI for owl carousel
[10:48:39] <robertmaxrees> yes, i just showed you where you can do it.
[10:48:55] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/OwlFonk/OwlCarousel this?
[10:49:14] <Perseus0> yep
[10:49:44] <Perseus0> oh ok got it, thanks
[10:49:54] <robertmaxrees> https://rawgit.com/OwlFonk/OwlCarousel/master/owl-carousel/owl.carousel.min.js
[10:50:40] <robertmaxrees> https://rawgit.com/OwlFonk/OwlCarousel/master/owl-carousel/owl.theme.css

[10:51:20] <Perseus0> thanks
[10:51:22] <Perseus0> :)
[10:51:24] <Perseus0> you're awesome
[10:51:37] <robertmaxrees> here: http://jsfiddle.net/btwsL31t/
[10:51:50] <robertmaxrees> this has the eternal resources added. just needs your basic html, css, and js
[10:52:17] <Perseus0> thanks :D
[11:00:02] <Perseus0> robertmaxrees: sorry for the delay, here it is http://jsfiddle.net/btwsL31t/1/
[11:02:53] <robertmaxrees> easy,  you're targeting the wrong things :)
[11:03:08] <Perseus0> :O
[11:04:39] <robertmaxrees> you said you only want to apply styles to the currently hovered item, right?
[11:06:30] <Perseus0> exactly :)
[11:06:51] <robertmaxrees> you could do this all via CSS fwiw.
[11:06:54] <Perseus0> so if I hover on an item, only that item gets hovered
[11:06:58] <Perseus0> i know
[11:07:08] <robertmaxrees> JS version: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/btwsL31t/3/
[11:07:15] <Perseus0> but I need multiple classes attached to the main div
[11:07:15] <robertmaxrees> css version would be a little nicer, but meh.
[11:07:30] <robertmaxrees> why?
[11:09:33] <Perseus0> perfeeeeeeeeeeeeect
[11:09:42] <robertmaxrees> see the difference?
[11:09:47] <Perseus0> nope :D
[11:09:52] <Perseus0> yes i see lol
[11:09:53] <Perseus0> i mean
[11:10:07] <Perseus0> as in css I don't see the difference
[11:10:17] <robertmaxrees> the javascript though.
[11:10:19] <Perseus0> it works as I wanted to with css
[11:10:24] <Perseus0> yes the js
[11:10:31] <Perseus0> it works beautifully thank you :)
[11:10:35] <robertmaxrees> you could do the exact same thing with JS, too, but meh.
[11:11:01] <Perseus0> in detriment of css?
[11:11:17] <robertmaxrees> rather, you could do the exact same thing in CSS - typo on my behalf.
[11:12:20] <robertmaxrees> ideally you shouldn't be using .css() at all.
[11:12:48] <Perseus0> oh
[11:13:02] <Perseus0> in css I had to attach multiple classes
[11:13:05] <robertmaxrees> you'd either addClass() and .removeClass() or just use CSS to do this all for you.
[11:13:11] <Perseus0> otherwise the hover wouldn't work
[11:13:21] <robertmaxrees> let me show you how you do it via CSS>
[11:13:25] <Perseus0> :)
[11:13:27] <Perseus0> thanks

[11:17:19] <Perseus0> uuuuuh so easy I the owl-item class didn't even occur my mind thanks robertmaxrees im going with the css solution thanks a lot :)
[11:17:29] <robertmaxrees> sure
[11:32:47] <adv_> watch.js doesn't have the capability of tracking top and left style changes?
[11:32:53] <adv_> https://github.com/darcyclarke/Watch.js
[11:35:55] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that?
[11:36:31] <adv_> robertmaxrees: because my console.log doesn't print out anything and it changes
[11:36:41] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ adv_

[11:42:51] <robertmaxrees> woah what's with the togetherjs thing
[11:43:44] <adv_> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[11:44:27] <robertmaxrees> <script>var TogetherJSConfig_autoStart = true;</script> etc.
[11:47:31] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h4kwLozf/ jquery version works.
[11:48:42] <adv_> robertmaxrees: it's my script
[11:48:56] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/mmb8d5tL/6/
[11:48:59] <adv_> simple version
[11:49:01] <adv_> you need to join the session to get the .togetherjs-cursor class to appear
[11:49:03] <adv_> open 2 tabs and join the session between you and yourself
[11:50:14] <robertmaxrees> err...
[11:50:21] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time.
[11:50:38] <robertmaxrees> watch.js is fine with the top property.
[11:50:56] <adv_> thanks
[11:50:58] <adv_> let me check
[11:51:08] <robertmaxrees> i showed you that in the example.
[11:51:17] <adv_> yeah saw that
[11:53:55] <adv_> robertmaxrees: so it doesn't work for some reason in the togetherjs example
[11:54:30] <adv_> <div class="togetherjs-cursor togetherjs togetherjs-scrolled-normal" style="color: rgb(32, 127, 151); opacity: 1; display: block; top: 310px; left: 540px;">
[11:54:40] <adv_> this is the element i'm trying to track
[11:54:58] <adv_> i can see in the dev tools that the top property is changing
[11:55:03] <adv_> but there's no console.log printing happening
[11:55:36] <robertmaxrees> err, why are you redeclaring that var halfway through?
[11:56:18] <adv_> robertmaxrees: which var?
[11:56:24] <robertmaxrees> div3
[11:56:37] <adv_> not redeclaring, it's in the examples
[11:56:46] <adv_> but this time i did it with jquery selector
[11:56:49] <adv_> like in your example
[11:57:18] <adv_> 	$('.togetherjs-cursor').watch('top', function(){
[11:57:18] <adv_>  console.log ("top changed!"); });
[11:57:29] <robertmaxrees> you have that your issue is that the div doesn't actually yet exist.
[11:57:43] <robertmaxrees> var div3 = document.querySelectorAll('.togetherjs-cursor.togetherjs.togetherjs-scrolled-normal'); doesn't match anything.
[11:57:48] <robertmaxrees> so the watch breaks.
[11:58:55] <adv_> hm how can i make sure it exists
[11:58:55] <adv_> ?
[11:59:04] <robertmaxrees> see if togetherjs has a callback.
[12:00:40] <robertmaxrees> TogetherJS.on("ready", function () {}): emitted when TogetherJS is fully started up.
[12:04:02] <adv_> robertmaxrees: thanks! works

[12:22:20] <robertmaxrees> i think you're convoluting things.
[12:22:33] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to init .selectable()'s automatically?
[12:22:54] <Riboh> yes, in $(document).ready()
[12:23:21] <robertmaxrees> have an example of what you're trying to do?
[12:23:45] <robertmaxrees> because i get the feeling you're trying to automatically init .selectable() when you add elements, but that's kind of a bad idea.
[12:24:12] <Riboh> And given my noviceness, I can imagine that I am most likely convoluting things.
[12:24:22] <Riboh> Yes I will try to explain
[12:24:44] <robertmaxrees> an example would be better
[12:24:44] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Riboh
[12:24:45] <b-ot> Riboh: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:25:01] <Riboh> Oh what a wonderful idea
[12:25:56] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:25:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fycqwnrv/ - this has jquery and jquery-ui included for you.  just needs your html and js
[12:43:29] <Riboh> That took me a second thank you for your patience http://jsfiddle.net/bohmchri/bhq8q3rp/
[12:44:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so there's technically a way to automate that, it's pretty hacky and can lead to some gross performance issues.
[12:44:35] <Riboh> I could remove the container and add .selectable() when adding the list of elements
[12:44:57] <Riboh> But I would much rather delegate the events
[12:45:04] <Riboh> If possible
[12:45:10] <notchris> How do I say ‚ÄúFor each td in tbody‚Äù
[12:45:11] <robertmaxrees> selectable isn't an event.
[12:45:23] <robertmaxrees> $('tbody td').each(), notchris
[12:45:33] <notchris> robertmaxrees: TY!
[12:45:44] <robertmaxrees> Riboh "click", is an event, but selectable is not, so you can't delegate it.
[12:46:32] <Riboh> Right, yeah I get that, but is there an option to delegate selectable's clicks to the tds?
[12:46:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:46:52] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with initializing them?
[12:49:08] <Riboh> I've found that if I say $('.some_element').on('event', '.some_sub_element', function(){ do something }) that it will affect newly created items. So I'm trying to apply that same concept here if possible.
[12:49:25] <robertmaxrees> right - .selectable() isn't an event.
[12:49:32] <robertmaxrees> you cannot delegate a non-event.
[12:49:34] <Riboh> right
[12:50:25] <robertmaxrees> if you're trying to autoinit selectables, you can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bhq8q3rp/3/
[12:51:41] <Riboh> I was hoping that there would be an option that I haven't found within selectable that would accomplish the same goal.
[12:52:03] <Riboh> I'll check that out one sec
[12:52:08] <robertmaxrees> no.  you have to explicitly initialize each one - you can't init wahat doesn't already exist.
[12:53:17] <Riboh> Oh hey, that works. I'd tried that but without the $newhtml. I suppose I'm not as familiar with referencing variables.
[12:53:23] <cdaringe> hi all.  is it a known issue that jquery-ui pulls jQuery off of the window vs from a require()?  i did a quick search in the GH issue list, didn't see it.  1.10.5 doesn't behave this way, but looks like 1.11.x ?  does
[12:54:10] <robertmaxrees> Riboh your first problem was you never declared $newhtml, so it was getting hoisted up to the global scope.
[12:54:33] <robertmaxrees> also, you may not have been initializing selectable correctly.
[12:58:41] <notchris> How do I select the contents of a div
[12:58:50] <notchris> So like
[12:58:57] <notchris> <div>1</div>
[12:59:09] <notchris> How do I wrap 1 ?
[12:59:12] <robertmaxrees> depents.
[12:59:20] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[12:59:23] <robmal> .html
[12:59:28] <notchris> $(‚Äòdiv‚Äô).wrap(<a></a>);
[12:59:36] <notchris> html did not work hmm
[12:59:39] <notchris> nor did text
[12:59:41] <robertmaxrees> contents()
[12:59:53] <robertmaxrees> though it depends on what you're doing.
[13:00:04] <robertmaxrees> you can use .html() if you want to wrap all the contents of the element in something.
[13:00:22] <notchris> contents was the one!
[13:00:25] <notchris> Thanks robertmaxrees
[13:01:35] <Riboh> Yes thankyou very much robertmaxtrees and notchris, I was interrupted and was unable to give you proper thanks earlier
[13:02:05] <robertmaxrees> Riboh sure.
[13:02:35] <adv_> robertmaxrees: why did you say that $('.togetherjs-cursor.togetherjs.togetherjs-scrolled-normal') will not match anything
[13:02:36] <adv_> ?
[13:03:03] <robertmaxrees> i didn't mean it wouldn't ever.
[13:03:12] <robertmaxrees> just that, when you were running that line, it wasn't matching anything.
[13:04:07] <microhaxo> Guys, i am using this plugin: http://harshen.github.io/jquery-countdownTimer/
[13:04:15] <microhaxo> How the hell do i stop the countdown?
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it supports that.
[13:05:55] <Riboh> hey robertmaxtrees, might I use your solution and the conversation here to post my question and solution online?
[13:06:08] <robertmaxrees> Riboh huh?
[13:06:33] <Riboh> can I copy this and put it on a blog? just the relevant stuff
[13:06:38] <robertmaxrees> sure if you want.
[13:06:42] <Riboh> Thanks
[13:07:03] <microhaxo> Is there some other trick I can use to stop it?
[13:07:20] <robertmaxrees> you could copy the node's contents, delete the original, and paste in the new.
[13:07:34] <robertmaxrees> or use another plugin.
[13:10:28] <adv_> i have a very difficult problem. it is about the coordinates reported upon mousemove. they are correct when in fullpage (f11) and incorrect when in normal browser window. any ideas?
[13:11:47] <robertmaxrees> incorrect how?
[13:17:15] <adv_> robertmaxrees: they have a slight offset
[13:17:43] <adv_> http://vdvsb.freevar.com/test2/testcase10.html if you want an example
[13:18:01] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:18:03] <robertmaxrees> how do i replicate?
[13:18:24] <robertmaxrees> woah why do you have togetherjs included 4 times on the page?
[13:18:26] <adv_> robertmaxrees: collab between you and yourself
[13:18:42] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:18:49] <robertmaxrees> a simplified use case.
[13:18:52] <adv_> robertmaxrees: it's just once , not 4
[13:19:01] <adv_> it's the most simplified case
[13:19:21] <robertmaxrees> every time i click an arrow, another instance of togetherjs is created: http://i.imgur.com/inCjR8O.png
[13:19:41] <adv_> yeah you're not supposed to click the arrows , sorry
[13:20:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> so i'm in my own session. what next?
[13:21:23] <adv_> if you click a specific spot from user1 , you will not see the same exact spot being clicked from user2
[13:21:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing iut.
[13:21:33] <robertmaxrees> *it
[13:21:37] <robertmaxrees> exact same spot on both.
[13:21:57] <adv_> no, it has a slight offset, click on the fullstop to observe
[13:22:16] <robertmaxrees> the what now?
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> because i'm ctrl+tabbing between the two pages and it's a-ok.
[13:22:48] <adv_> the farther away the spot is from the top left corner , the greater the offset
[13:23:14] <adv_>  when the spot is clicked in fullscreen mode (both users are in fullscreen mode ), there is no offset
[13:23:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing no offset, period.
[13:23:51] <notchris> So I made a function I want to apply to each td
[13:23:56] <notchris> So I know how to create a function
[13:23:59] <notchris> To apply it...
[13:24:07] <adv_> robertmaxrees: click on the last fullstop , there is an offset
[13:24:20] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you mean by "fullstop", adv_
[13:24:24] <notchris> $(‚Äòtd‚Äô).each(‚ÄòmyFunction‚Äô);   ?
[13:24:35] <robertmaxrees> notchris $('td').each(myFunction);
[13:24:37] <adv_> i mean next to Purnarna (the last char of the image)
[13:24:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'm not seeing it, adv_
[13:24:53] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[13:25:01] <notchris> ty robertmaxrees
[13:25:11] <adv_> robertmaxrees: can you please post a screenshot ?
[13:25:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how i'm supposed to post a screenshot of two things at once.
[13:25:37] <adv_> lol
[13:25:55] <adv_> just the click of user2 from user1's view
[13:26:06] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Hmm, had an issue: http://rocketb.in/paste/w6joyR
[13:26:33] <robertmaxrees> notchris that's not how you do that.
[13:26:43] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to write a plugin- it should contain it's own .each()
[13:28:00] <robertmaxrees> adv_ http://i.imgur.com/kMOU8VD.png
[13:28:28] <notchris> robertmaxrees: This worked before: http://rocketb.in/paste/kX8WQz
[13:28:40] <notchris> But every time I change the calendar page, it will need to re-apply links
[13:28:44] <robertmaxrees> notchris right, but doing $.fn.someName registers it as a plugin.
[13:28:50] <notchris> So I wanted to make it a function
[13:28:56] <adv_> robertmaxrees: lol, you're not clicking the fullstop next to 'Purnarna'
[13:28:57] <robertmaxrees> a plugin, or a function?
[13:28:58] <notchris> So that if someone changes the calendar page, it would re apply it
[13:29:11] <robertmaxrees> adv_ you mean the period?
[13:29:23] <adv_> robertmaxrees: yes, sorry
[13:29:26] <robertmaxrees> exact same story.
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> exact same position.
[13:29:44] <notchris> robertmaxrees: A function I believe, I want it to run that script whenever the calendar month is changed
[13:29:51] <adv_> robertmaxrees: not user1 to user1, but user1 to user2
[13:30:00] <notchris> I have buttons controlling next and previous month
[13:30:07] <robertmaxrees> adv_ i have shown you what i'm seeing.
[13:30:10] <robertmaxrees> it works fine.
[13:30:17] <adv_> browser?
[13:30:20] <robertmaxrees> ff.
[13:30:32] <adv_> hm
[13:30:36] <adv_> can you try in chrome?
[13:30:44] <robertmaxrees> adv_ i don't have time to do this any more...
[13:30:53] <adv_> ok thanks anyway
[13:31:10] <robertmaxrees> notchris then put everything in that IIFE and declare it as a normal function.
[13:31:21] <robertmaxrees> var calendarLinks = function() {};
[13:33:17] <notchris> robertmaxrees: not like this? http://rocketb.in/paste/VzZ1bR
[13:33:23] <notchris> Oh, maybe I see now
[13:34:56] <adv_> robertmaxrees: what is your resolution?
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> 1920x1200, but i wasn't fullscreen
[13:35:40] <adv_> i'm seeing an offset in ff
[13:35:59] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you at this point.
[13:36:01] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I did it! http://rocketb.in/paste/pRdnrX
[13:36:02] <notchris> Woot
[13:36:14] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:36:18] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i meant.
[13:36:38] <robertmaxrees> in fact, that's not going to do what you think.
[13:37:40] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/1rhmpaj/
[13:37:43] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[13:43:48] <_1_sandy352> hey
[13:51:25] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Cant seem to trigger the function when I click the next/prev buttons
[13:51:27] <notchris> http://rocketb.in/paste/N6nokR
[13:51:34] <robertmaxrees> again.
[13:51:42] <robertmaxrees>  http://fixee.org/paste/1rhmpaj/ is what you want.
[13:52:16] <notchris> Oh! I‚Äôm sorry, i didn not see that
[13:52:25] <notchris> Thank you
[13:54:08] <notchris> Hmm
[13:54:17] <notchris> Still cant get it to work on next/prev click
[13:54:26] <robertmaxrees> are those buttons added after the page loads?
[13:54:30] <robertmaxrees> or replaced by something?>
[13:54:57] <notchris> Hmm, quite possibly
[13:55:56] <notchris> Ahh OK I got it working, I had to hook it to the original script
[13:56:31] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[13:57:24] <notchris> Thank you robertmaxrees
[13:57:33] <notchris> You‚Äôre always very helpful and I appreciate your time
[13:58:54] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[14:02:23] <notchris> robertmaxrees: :D
[14:11:11] <StanAccy> If Ive got a selector, sel1, is there a better way to remove those elements from a more encompassing selector, sel2, other than: sel2.not( sel1 ).doWhatever(0
[14:31:44] <Joel> I'm not getting any of the console.log's in the .done or the .fail, any thoughts? I'm also not seeing it hit the server: https://gist.github.com/jjshoe/5eca3a04fee3fd60230f
[14:31:54] <Joel> I do see the correct values for the settings object though
[14:40:22] <bepolite> hey
[15:31:31] <vacho> can someone please tell me why this is returning undefined? https://jsfiddle.net/xbsaach6/
[15:32:14] <robertmaxrees> $(this) refers to the <select>, not the <option>
[15:32:31] <vacho> robertmaxrees: oh man.. ok .. so how do I get the selected value?
[15:32:43] <robertmaxrees> *the data attributes of the selected item ;)
[15:33:26] <vacho> robertmaxrees:  totally makes sense, but not sure how to update it.. I would usually do 'select option' but now I hvae this.. so not sure
[15:33:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xbsaach6/1/
[15:34:33] <vacho> robertmaxrees: that is beautiful.. note that my select dropdown is loaded into dom after document ready.. since it comes in via ajax request.. will this still work?
[15:34:59] <robertmaxrees> is it the <select> or the options?
[15:35:44] <vacho> robertmaxrees: the whole clause.. select and option
[15:36:01] <vacho> robertmaxrees: works great when I paste it in my console though after ajax reload :)
[15:36:03] <robertmaxrees> then no, because $(".attending-select").change(function () { won't bind to anything.
[15:36:09] <robertmaxrees> you need to use event delegation instead.
[15:36:46] <robertmaxrees> what's a parent element that exists on pageload?
[15:36:53] <vacho> robertmaxrees: yes I figured, I am new to this so still learning.
[15:37:02] <vacho> robertmaxrees: it's inside a datatable, so everything is loaded through ajax
[15:37:15] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question :)
[15:37:18] <vacho> robertmaxrees: it's inside a table, that is also loaded after doc ready
[15:37:29] <robertmaxrees> reread my question :)
[15:37:37] <vacho> ok
[15:37:47] <robertmaxrees> what's a parent element that exists on pageload?
[15:37:48] <vacho> parent element would be <table id="datatable></div>
[15:37:55] <robertmaxrees> does that exist on pageload?
[15:38:02] <vacho> robertmaxrees: yes sir it does
[15:38:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xbsaach6/2/
[15:38:39] <robertmaxrees> that won't work in the fiddle for obvious reasons.
[15:38:44] <robertmaxrees> but it should show you the basic idea.
[15:39:59] <bepolite> ?prev
[15:40:15] <robertmaxrees> ?api prev
[15:40:15] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .prev(): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[15:40:46] <vacho> robertmaxrees: wow, you are awesome man, thank you so much for being so helpful to a total stranger. thank you
[15:40:55] <robertmaxrees> that's what we're here for :)
[15:41:20] <bepolite> Not total stranger though
[15:51:26] <Emn1ty> So, I'm getting some odd behavior with sortable, and was wondering if anyone had experienced it?
[15:51:45] <Emn1ty> When dismissing an alert directly over a sortable element, it acts as if you are dragging that element
[15:52:13] <Emn1ty> alert -> hit `ok` -> am now dragging the element without even holding down the mouse
[15:52:35] <robertmaxrees> any particular reason you're using an alert?
[15:52:45] <robertmaxrees> and not, say, a modal?
[15:53:37] <Emn1ty> not really, just for simplicity at the moment
[15:54:18] <robertmaxrees> i know it seems like a copout, but i'd not use an alert in this case.  feel free to drop in a bug to the jqui team, but that's just my opinion.
[15:56:04] <checkit> Hey guys... Trying to figure out to serialize something like the following for an ajax request: http://jsfiddle.net/uph3rzLn/
[15:56:19] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:56:32] <robertmaxrees> Origin and Destination are arrays.
[15:57:04] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with .Latitude and .Longitude there?
[15:58:48] <mrjonleek> robertmaxrees: Already fixed that. Oversite due to rapi development: http://jsfiddle.net/uph3rzLn/1/
[15:59:09] <robertmaxrees> okay.  what's the issue then?
[15:59:27] <robertmaxrees> that's a valid data structure.
[16:00:39] <mrjonleek> robertmaxrees: No issue now. Was just letting you know. Sorry for wasting time :/
[16:00:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:00:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm very confused haha
[16:01:49] <mrjonleek> robertmaxrees: It's okay buddy. I came to your channel and made a confusing mess for no reason.. All good now. :)
[16:01:57] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[16:07:08] <Perseus0> robertmaxrees: hey Robbert, could you give me a hand ? :)
[16:07:15] <robertmaxrees> just ask mang.
[16:07:19] <Perseus0> :D
[16:07:21] <Perseus0> thanks
[16:07:22] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[16:07:42] <Perseus0> yes but you've helped earlier today ;)
[16:07:49] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter ;)
[16:08:01] <Perseus0> :D
[16:10:39] <compact> hi. http://pastebin.com/Rcq0f3va <-- any idea why it won't clone the TR
[16:12:13] <compact> schnoodles, from austnet?
[16:12:35] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "won't"?
[16:12:43] <robertmaxrees> what's it doing instead?
[16:12:47] <schnoodles> compact, yep.
[16:12:47] <Perseus0> same thing as earlier today with the carousel but how can I crop the image width-wise? http://jsfiddle.net/Perseus0/btwsL31t/5/
[16:13:02] <compact> robertmaxrees, it won't clone. no errors in console log
[16:13:35] <robertmaxrees> put a console log as the first thing in there - does that fire?
[16:13:39] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 not sure i follow.
[16:13:59] <Perseus0> ok  i will explain
[16:14:10] <compact> yeah, it gets the click. I've done alerts, console log etc to make sure
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> compact can you make a simplified fiddle to demonstrate?
[16:16:00] <Perseus0> the carousel adjusts the images in height and width accordingly to each image's size but I want image item to have less width, in having so, it will crop the image width-wise and makes sure it has more height
[16:16:14] <Perseus0> not sure if this makes sense though
[16:16:42] <robertmaxrees> you always want each image to take up 100% of the available height and crop horizontally if need be?
[16:16:50] <Perseus0> yes
[16:17:08] <Perseus0> yet i want it to crop more in width
[16:17:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:17:19] <robertmaxrees> how much?
[16:17:24] <compact> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/rg9dy937/1/
[16:17:27] <Perseus0> for aesthetics purposes
[16:17:48] <Perseus0> hmm
[16:18:10] <robertmaxrees> compact that's not how .closest() works.
[16:18:31] <Perseus0> yes I want each image to take 100% of the available height but I want it to take less than 100%, let's say 80%, for width
[16:18:47] <robertmaxrees> compact .closest() goes through an elements parents until it finds something that matches the selector.
[16:18:54] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 that doens't make any sense.
[16:18:59] <Perseus0> :D
[16:19:12] <robertmaxrees> you're arbitrarily saying you want to crop x amount for no reason.
[16:19:17] <compact> reason being its like that is because i may clone that table
[16:19:26] <compact> so when i clone the row, i want to make sure it clones the correct row
[16:19:45] <robertmaxrees> compact that doesn't change how .closest() works.
[16:19:47] <Perseus0> it's for a reason, it's for aesthetics purposes
[16:20:15] <Perseus0> x amount of % in width of the image is meant to be hidden
[16:20:15] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 that doesn't make any sense.  it'd make more sense to say you want to to take 100% of the available height and crop any excess width.
[16:20:34] <Perseus0> it already does that
[16:20:58] <Perseus0> well it crops accordingly to the height and width of the images provided
[16:21:16] <Perseus0> but yeah
[16:21:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:21:21] <Perseus0> i don't think this is doable
[16:21:23] <robertmaxrees> you've lost me.
[16:21:30] <Perseus0> hm
[16:22:04] <robertmaxrees> you're saying you want to always crop a certain percentage of an image's width - the issue with that is images can be different widths.
[16:22:18] <robertmaxrees> so an arbitrary percentage doesn't make much sense.
[16:22:19] <Perseus0> exactly
[16:22:33] <compact> robertmaxrees, I've updated it http://jsfiddle.net/rg9dy937/2/
[16:22:53] <robertmaxrees> compact again, .closest() goes "up" the tree.
[16:23:16] <Perseus0> although I don't want to remove width from the image but to hide it
[16:23:34] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 you want to limit the image to a particular width?
[16:23:49] <Perseus0> essentially yes
[16:24:11] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18673900/how-to-center-and-crop-an-image-to-square-with-css
[16:24:43] <robertmaxrees> a few different ways to approach, but that should give you the basic idea.
[16:25:06] <robertmaxrees> compact you need to select the table explicitly.
[16:34:44] <compact> robertmaxrees, like $tr.closest('table').find('tr');
[16:34:45] <compact> ?
[16:34:57] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how to re-phrase this.
[16:35:03] <Perseus0> thanks robertmaxrees i just don't think this carousel can be customizable in this way
[16:35:04] <robertmaxrees> .closest() doesn't look for sibling el;ements.
[16:35:09] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 it can be.
[16:35:14] <Perseus0> :(
[16:35:17] <robertmaxrees> head over to #css - they can enlighten you.
[16:35:25] <Perseus0> thanks
[16:35:32] <robertmaxrees> compact .closest() goes through parent elements, not siblings.
[16:39:27] <compact> ah .siblings()
[16:43:39] <Perseus0> :)
[16:43:56] <Ruffus> Hello all! Can anyone please tell me what am I doing wrong here http://pastebin.com/ykSgaKNd ? The form doesn't send anything to the post script.
[16:44:33] <robertmaxrees> $('form.subscribe').serialize() doesn't match anything, Ruffus
[16:44:47] <robertmaxrees> try $('#subscribe').serialize() instead.
[16:45:15] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 what have you tried?
[16:45:26] <robertmaxrees> because i sent you a link that shows you how to crop images.
[16:45:32] <Perseus0> yes i know
[16:45:41] <Perseus0> that's how i would do if i had a normal image
[16:45:51] <Ruffus> awesome robertmaxrees, thank you
[16:45:59] <Perseus0> that's basic stuff but the problem resides on the images in the carousel
[16:46:03] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 how are these images abnormal?
[16:46:20] <Perseus0> no, they're normal :D
[16:46:30] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what the disconnect is, then,
[16:46:42] <Perseus0> :(
[16:46:58] <Perseus0> i have tried the position:absolute left and right
[16:47:43] <Perseus0> in this owl carousel container it just pushes the whole carousel to the left or right
[16:47:47] <Perseus0> as assigned
[16:47:53] <Perseus0> it doesn't crop
[16:47:58] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to add an extra div around just the img tag.
[16:48:19] <Perseus0> :)
[16:48:24] <Perseus0> let me try that :)
[16:48:38] <robertmaxrees> some google searching will show you a lot.
[16:49:47] <Perseus0> trust me, i have been on google searching for a couple of hours now
[16:49:56] <Perseus0> read the whole owl carousel documentation
[16:50:20] <robertmaxrees> http://spigotdesign.com/crop-any-size-image-with-css/ this should be a good, concise basic version: http://spigotdesign.com/crop-any-size-image-with-css/
[16:54:28] <Perseus0> <div class="box"><div class="image-crop"><img src=""/></div><p class="white-box">01<br><br>Text1</p><hr class="hr-box"></div> selected  .image-crop and added position:absolute (the carousel vanishes) then added position:relative and left:-20% and the it pushes the carousel to the left , same deal as before
[16:54:37] <robertmaxrees> show me the fiddle.
[16:54:40] <robertmaxrees> not in the channel.
[17:01:37] <Perseus0> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/Perseus0/btwsL31t/8/
[17:03:07] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:03:14] <robertmaxrees> why'd you kill the image sources?
[17:03:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:03:41] <Perseus0> just for demonstration purposes :/
[17:04:02] <robertmaxrees> that's going to break things on its own.
[17:04:09] <Perseus0> I can do the placeholder.it etc but it's the same deal
[17:04:11] <Perseus0> not at all
[17:04:22] <Perseus0> if you remove the .image-crop code
[17:04:28] <robertmaxrees> *break* meaning "won't demonstrate the desired effect"
[17:04:30] <Perseus0> you get the same thing as im getting
[17:04:45] <Perseus0> it will, trust me, it's exactly as i have it
[17:04:54] <Perseus0> but i will add the placeholder it
[17:04:55] <robertmaxrees> and you're not following the guide i just sent you.
[17:05:35] <Perseus0> you've sent me 2 guides
[17:05:45] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to encourage you to play around.
[17:05:46] <Perseus0> actually one
[17:05:46] <robertmaxrees> experiment.
[17:05:51] <robertmaxrees> http://spigotdesign.com/crop-any-size-image-with-css/
[17:05:56] <Perseus0> :D
[17:05:56] <robertmaxrees> this one doesn't modify any positioning at all.
[17:06:05] <Perseus0> thanks but i've experimented so much
[17:06:13] <Perseus0> let's give it another try :)
[17:06:16] <robertmaxrees> let me guess: you just want somebody to show you.
[17:06:20] <Perseus0> nope
[17:06:24] <Perseus0> of course not
[17:06:39] <Perseus0> i wouldn't come here if i wasn't tired of figuring out a solution
[17:06:50] <Perseus0> it's 1 am i would much better be sleeping by now ;)
[17:07:36] <robertmaxrees> either way: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/btwsL31t/9/
[17:07:39] <robertmaxrees> this is the basic idea.
[17:07:49] <robertmaxrees> not perfect, but it should give you a place to start.
[17:09:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/btwsL31t/10/ even better
[17:16:09] <Perseus0> thanks but doesn't work
[17:16:14] <checkit> okay robertmaxrees, perhaps now I could use your skills: http://jsfiddle.net/ssaqw1ru/
[17:16:25] <Perseus0> some of the images get invisible
[17:16:28] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 huh?  sure it does.  i'm seeing it function in the fiddle.
[17:16:41] <robertmaxrees> it's an excessive version, but it gets the point accross.
[17:17:09] <robertmaxrees> checkit ooh.
[17:17:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:17:55] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Update... left out a bit of code: http://jsfiddle.net/ssaqw1ru/1/
[17:18:25] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[17:18:39] <checkit> When I console out I'm not seeing the origin data in there....
[17:20:19] <robertmaxrees> hrm.   one sec.
[17:20:39] <robertmaxrees> it's purely because of the geolocation api call.
[17:20:55] <checkit> I figured the same...
[17:22:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ssaqw1ru/2/
[17:22:33] <robertmaxrees> it takes a second, but it works.
[17:22:38] <compact> robertmaxrees, still can't figure it out :P
[17:22:50] <robertmaxrees> compact show me what you've got.
[17:23:36] <compact> can't really get past the siblings :P
[17:23:37] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/rg9dy937/3/
[17:23:56] <robertmaxrees> .siblings('table')
[17:24:05] <robertmaxrees> then .find('tr').last();
[17:24:24] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rg9dy937/4/
[17:24:44] <robertmaxrees> there is no sibling to the button that matches the selector 'table tr'
[17:24:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to get the table first, then go from there.
[17:26:46] <Perseus0> it sort of works robertmaxrees but then the different widths screw it up
[17:27:43] <robertmaxrees> screw it up how?
[17:29:46] <compact> thanks robertmaxrees. any idea why the table row won't clone on a cloned table though
[17:29:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:29:55] <Perseus0> take up space in the container
[17:30:02] <Perseus0> and ruin the other images
[17:30:06] <Perseus0> oh man i quit
[17:30:08] <Perseus0> thanks a lot
[17:30:13] <Perseus0> it's as it's
[17:30:27] <robertmaxrees> compact are you cloning the link, as well?
[17:30:35] <Perseus0> i hate designers that don't know how to program and just invent stuff
[17:30:47] <compact> nope, just the table. the link stays on the page though
[17:30:56] <compact> the 'ad new product'
[17:30:57] <robertmaxrees> compact i'd have to see the bug in action.
[17:30:58] <compact> is cloned
[17:31:15] <robertmaxrees> Perseus0 what you're trying to do isn't unreasonable.
[17:31:19] <robertmaxrees> it just takes some work.
[17:31:26] <compact> my bad. 'Add New Product' is cloned too
[17:31:41] <robertmaxrees> compact that's part of why.  look into event delegation.
[17:35:53] <compact> awesome, got it. thanks
[17:36:58] <Sal> hey guys, whats the best way to name <a> for events? my app loads many pieces of html via ajaz, and every piuce has its own links and buttons
[17:37:06] <Sal> how do you guys handle this?
[17:37:10] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:37:38] <Sal> is it possible to put event code directly inside the html piece ?
[17:37:45] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[17:37:49] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[17:37:55] <Sal> or should i name every link or button with a uniq id ?
[17:38:00] <Perseus0> robertmaxrees: i know but it takes time and i haven't ran out of it
[17:38:05] <Perseus0> *have
[17:38:17] <robertmaxrees> Sal use a generic class and data attributes.
[17:39:34] <Sal> robertmaxrees, like <a href="#" class="action" data-delrow=""> ?
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> what would that link do?
[17:40:05] <Sal> call a function del row
[17:40:13] <Sal> delRow(e)
[17:40:16] <robertmaxrees> the class should be generic to what the link does, sort of.  <a href="#" class="delete-row"></a>
[17:40:31] <robertmaxrees> then use a delegated listener to handle all of those links.
[17:41:09] <Sal> for that you mean $(document).on('click', 'delete-row', delRow); ?
[17:41:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd bind lower than the document.
[17:41:53] <Sal> oh
[17:42:00] <Sal> body?
[17:42:01] <robertmaxrees> but that's the basic gist, yeah.
[17:42:13] <robertmaxrees> is there a container that doesn't get replaced?
[17:42:24] <Sal> hmmm... but that will require a .js file only for the listeners
[17:42:25] <Sal> hehehe
[17:42:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:42:44] <robertmaxrees> you should have all your code in JS files to begin with.
[17:42:46] <Sal> aint it better to define the listener only when piece of html gets loaded?
[17:42:52] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[17:43:05] <robertmaxrees> depends on the case - in yours, i'd go ahead and bind the listeners regardless.
[17:43:11] <robertmaxrees> the overhead is minimal.
[17:43:28] <Sal> because iy could happen that some divs never get loaded at all
[17:43:35] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[17:43:39] <Sal> ok
[17:44:03] <Sal> and where you usually put all these listeners?
[17:44:12] <Sal> at the beginning of the main js file?
[17:46:29] <Sal> robertmaxrees, thanks
[17:49:32] <Sal> ok, i'll take a little break with my strato now, bbl
[20:27:19] <jqueryius> hello
[20:27:31] <jqueryius> I have a series of inputs/selects/textboxes, etc
[20:27:43] <jqueryius> I've set it up so when you fill out one, the next one becomes enabled
[20:27:48] <jqueryius> to ensure it's not filled out of order
[20:28:17] <jqueryius> Now there's one thing that's causing me a problem... one of the textboxes autofills when a user presses a button (like a stopwatch)
[20:28:34] <jqueryius> but .change on input won't work because it works on when it loses focus i believe
[20:28:46] <jqueryius> .keyup won't work because jquery is populating the input field
[20:29:10] <jqueryius> I tried: $('#test').on('input', function(e){ ...
[20:29:17] <jqueryius> but that has no impact either
[20:29:41] <jqueryius> are there any other events I could hook into which will fire when the input box changes?
[20:37:29] <bepolite> ?api change
[20:37:29] <b-ot> bepolite: .change(): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[20:37:40] <jqueryius> [11:28] <jqueryius> but .change on input won't work because it works on when it loses focus i believe
[20:37:52] <jqueryius> is that incorrect?
[20:38:25] <bepolite> Well I think it is incorrect
[20:38:35] <bepolite> .change event fires when the input changes
[20:38:45] <bepolite> It doesn't matter wheather focus is lost or not
[20:38:47] <jqueryius> it doesn't work
[20:38:53] <jqueryius> I was sure I had tried it
[20:41:16] <bepolite> jqueryius: If you create a fiddle, I can work from there
[20:41:25] <bepolite> maybe its another part of your code causing it
[20:41:30] <jqueryius> ok, one moment
[20:45:56] <jqueryius> bepolite: http://jsfiddle.net/6xzunucs/
[20:46:49] <jqueryius> I know it might seem counter-intuitive to want the FIRED event to happen when the input box changes rather than when the button is clicked, which would be much easier
[20:47:00] <jqueryius> but I need it to be the input field
[20:53:44] <bepolite> jqueryius: http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/vdyLkpk3/
[20:53:48] <bepolite> You were right
[20:56:02] <jqueryius> ah okay, so you forcibly trigger the change event by putting .change(); after val?
[20:57:18] <bepolite> yep
[20:57:30] <bepolite> jqueryius: If you read from here https://api.jquery.com/change/
[20:57:36] <bepolite> val() doesn't fire change event
[20:58:13] <jqueryius> thanks
[20:58:26] <jqueryius> your solution is clever
[20:59:49] <bepolite> jqueryius: unfortunately, I think there's no other workaround
[21:00:10] <bepolite> I've seen the same question on stackoverflow with similar answers to what I gave
[21:00:10] <jqueryius> i think this works well
[21:00:45] <bepolite> Nice
[21:01:03] * bepolite sleeps at 05:am :) What a day
[21:01:47] <jqueryius> thanks for your help
[21:02:04] <bepolite> no problem
[21:35:54] <vivekananda> I have an interesting problem. I have a running autocomplete widget. In it onKeyup I show values. These values are coming from an ajax call to the database. Now what is happening is on typing a little quickly the items in keyup execute but the values haven't been returned yet. so the key expressions think tht there is no such value but it refreshes in a bit. I can workaround this by doing async=false but I want to
[21:35:54] <vivekananda> understand a better way
[21:37:19] <luaboy> if I intend to use $.post ,do i need to require jquery?
[21:40:49] <Uhkis> luaboy: yes, you need jquery to run jquery functions
[21:48:03] <igyiguygyu> what would be the best way to attach and remove a child container to a big list of parent containers?
[21:48:06] <igyiguygyu> randomly
[21:49:52] <liambrown> What do you mean by randomly? You mean insert it into a list at a random point?
[21:50:21] <igyiguygyu> Not really, it has to be on in the same point but by random i mean under random li elements
[21:51:04] <igyiguygyu> I have 3 UL elements and each one of those UL elements have ~30 li elements (picture thumbnails). I just want to add overlay to each of those thumbnails randomly
[21:51:23] <igyiguygyu> Does that make any sense at all? :/
[21:53:56] <liambrown> So you want to select one of the UL elements and overlay each of its children?
[21:54:03] <liambrown> With the same thing?
[21:54:34] <igyiguygyu> I just wrote a simple markdown so it's easier to understand
[21:54:34] <igyiguygyu> https://jsfiddle.net/c65767Lk/
[21:56:03] <igyiguygyu> It can even add 3 or 2 at the same time, I just want it to be as random as possible.
[21:56:42] <liambrown> Got it. You're adding children to the li elements randomly without regard to the parent elements.
[21:58:00] <igyiguygyu> Well yeah. If this helps - it's a bunch of profile pictures, and the overlay container is kind of like old tv static. So by adding that over it'll look that some of the profile pictures are glutting.
[21:58:04] <igyiguygyu> glitching*
[21:58:10] <igyiguygyu> thats why it should be pretty random
[21:58:31] <igyiguygyu> Was looking if there's some libraries that could help with this - couldn't find.
[22:04:14] <liambrown> Selector first: $("div[class^='container']")
[22:04:21] <liambrown> Sorry,  hit enter too soon.
[22:05:12] <luaboy> how to require jquery code in js file ?
[22:06:00] <liambrown> igyiguygyu: var elements_list = $("ul[class^='container']").children("li")
[22:06:17] <liambrown> Should give you an array of all the elements you want to overlay.
[22:06:54] <liambrown> Random selection of elements can be done in several ways; you could even iterate through the whole list.
[22:07:27] <liambrown> In that case, you'd randomly decide whether to prepend the overlay on each element.
[22:08:15] <liambrown> But for an arbitrary one, $(elements_list)[x].prepend(overlay_element);
[22:09:15] <igyiguygyu> so class^ will select all 3 UL's is that right?
[22:16:42] <igyiguygyu> I'll try it in jsfiddle
[22:44:55] <igyiguygyu> liambrown: seems like it's adding on run over all of them.
[22:44:57] <igyiguygyu> https://jsfiddle.net/c65767Lk/2/
[22:45:32] <igyiguygyu> So here's the question - what goes in that [x] that you wrote before? It should add and remove the element randomly
[22:45:46] <igyiguygyu> Can Jquery even do something like this or it should be js?
[22:50:56] <vivekananda> hey everyone what is wrong here ? http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/jq0bL5w9/1/
[22:51:01] <vivekananda> just trying an alert
[22:51:18] <vivekananda> my intention is to change the li inside to the li
[22:51:25] <vivekananda> in the variable eventually
[22:56:53] <igyiguygyu> if you have id="change"
[22:56:58] <igyiguygyu> then you have to call #change not change
[22:57:03] <igyiguygyu> http://jsfiddle.net/jq0bL5w9/2/
[22:57:06] <igyiguygyu> here's your code
[22:58:48] <vivekananda> no worries I found it
[22:59:03] <vivekananda> igyiguygyu, thanks I got that :)
[22:59:19] <vivekananda> intemixing js and jquery always confuses so much :(
[22:59:34] <Uhkis> there's no such thing
[23:00:06] <vivekananda> Uhkis, I meant the syntax
[23:00:46] <vivekananda> getElementbyId('value') works but $('value') wont coz it needs $('#value')
[23:00:52] <vivekananda> Uhkis, ^^
[23:02:00] <Uhkis> yeah that's pretty obvious
[23:02:41] <vivekananda> Uhkis, that is what confuses me lots of times ( what I was also doing here too ) . if you dont use jquery / js for a bit I forget which one was which
[23:03:31] <Uhkis> vivekananda: it's pretty simple, there already is the word "id" in the plain js function and jquery needs that # to know it's an id
[23:11:39] <vivekananda> hmmm nice
[23:11:42] <vivekananda> that will help
[23:15:20] <igyiguygyu> So anyone can help me out on how to append random and remove containers randomly?
[23:15:57] <Cork> igyiguygyu: "randomly"?
[23:15:58] <igyiguygyu> https://jsfiddle.net/c65767Lk/2/ it appends them all at once now, but it should add randomly them
[23:17:13] <igyiguygyu> Cork:  it can even append 2 or 3 at the same time, as long as it looks completely random
[23:18:03] <Cork> by random you mean random position?
[23:18:03] <igyiguygyu> and remove it within .5-1s
[23:18:10] <igyiguygyu> No, random times
[23:18:18] <Cork> ?man math.random

[23:18:44] <Cork> igyiguygyu: those are the ones you need
[23:20:07] <Cork> igyiguygyu: also never ever do "ul[class^='container']"
[23:20:28] <Cork> igyiguygyu: use the "ul.container" syntax
[23:20:28] <igyiguygyu> instead..?
[23:20:42] <igyiguygyu> oh, ok
[23:20:43] <igyiguygyu> thanks
[23:22:23] <Cork> igyiguygyu: btw you can optimize that selector even more: $("ul.container > li")
[23:27:00] <igyiguygyu> Shit I don't get it
[23:27:10] <Uhkis> igyiguygyu: something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/c65767Lk/5/ ?
[23:27:36] <Cork> Uhkis: setInterval...
[23:28:15] <Cork> also he wanted random time not place
[23:28:48] <igyiguygyu> Yeah! Uhkis like that! Thanks so much! ‚Ä¶but, is it possible to make it even more random that it sometimes adds 2 or 3 for example?
[23:29:05] <Cork> O_o
[23:29:08] <Uhkis> Cork: cheesy disco lights sounds way more like that ;)
[23:29:13] <igyiguygyu> Random places too.
[23:31:18] <jqueryius> can anyone think of a classy way to automatically include a suffix on an input field
[23:31:25] <jqueryius> for example, I am measuring something in litres
[23:31:29] <jqueryius> so a person will type in a number
[23:31:42] <jqueryius> but I want it to be saved as 500 L (for example)
[23:32:31] <Uhkis> var classy = $(field).val() + 'L'; ?
[23:32:52] <jqueryius> i've applied a class to all of my input fields
[23:32:57] <jqueryius> say .answer
[23:33:00] <codedecay-laptop> I wouldn't store it with L though.
[23:33:12] <jqueryius> and i'm using jquery to automatically loop through all the input fields in .answer as a class
[23:33:20] <codedecay-laptop> L is a display property not a storage property
[23:33:42] <Cork> igyiguygyu: https://jsfiddle.net/c65767Lk/6/
[23:34:20] <Cork> hmm
[23:34:26] <jqueryius> codedecay-laptop: I hear you, and to some extent I agree
[23:34:35] <jqueryius> but a lot of the script is dynamic
[23:34:46] <jqueryius> it's not worth it to add an extra database column for the measure
[23:34:53] <jqueryius> when maybe only 3/100 require it
[23:35:03] <jqueryius> everything gets stored as varchar anyway
[23:35:11] <igyiguygyu> Cork: this is perfect! Except it only adds to the first container :D But everything else is just as I need
[23:35:12] <jqueryius> so it may as well have L attached to it
[23:35:20] <Cork> igyiguygyu: ya, i saw that https://jsfiddle.net/c65767Lk/7/
[23:35:40] <Uhkis> now that's cheesy! :D
[23:35:43] <Cork> though that isn't really random actually
[23:36:01] <Cork> igyiguygyu: what one should do is use count and do a loop around the start math
[23:36:42] <jqueryius> could i use a data attribute?
[23:37:09] <igyiguygyu> Cork: Yeah this one is as cheesy as it can get! Thanks, I'll fiddle around with the math parameters to get the desired look as my containers are way bigger than 3x3
[23:37:40] <Cork> igyiguygyu: https://jsfiddle.net/c65767Lk/8/
[23:37:51] <Cork> though it gets too long sometimes
[23:37:57] <Cork> not sure what happens there
[23:38:12] <Cork> ah, ofcourse
[23:38:19] <Cork> it can get the same one twice :)
[23:38:43] <igyiguygyu> Oh this one sometimes jumps outside of container
[23:38:56] <Uhkis> yup, needs non-random second one
[23:38:59] <Cork> igyiguygyu: https://jsfiddle.net/c65767Lk/9/
[23:39:05] <Cork> Uhkis: nope
[23:39:22] <Cork> can't be much more random then this :)
[23:39:45] <igyiguygyu> You see what I'm gonna do with this is I have 3 lists of picture thumbnails. The Overlay is this >> http://codepen.io/kokozaurz/pen/qEeZxy
[23:39:50] <Cork> and cpu efficient for that matter (only animates when the page has focus)
[23:40:33] <Uhkis> doesn't really eat cpu anyways
[23:40:55] <Cork> Uhkis: that would depend on what hardware it runs on
[23:41:16] <igyiguygyu> So I'll need to fiddle around with the math parameters to get the right intensity
[23:41:31] <Uhkis> Cork: ye, of course
[23:41:39] <Cork> igyiguygyu: currently the timeout is 0 - 100 ms
[23:41:48] <Cork> so ya, you most likely want to add a + at the end
[23:42:02] <Cork> (similarly to how count works)
[23:43:08] <igyiguygyu> + after what?
[23:43:40] <Cork> 100) + 200 for example
[23:43:58] <Cork> basically you want to offset the 0 to a min delay time
[23:44:44] <Cork> ex. https://jsfiddle.net/c65767Lk/10/
[23:45:42] <igyiguygyu> Oh yeah I see. Makes sense now.
[23:47:01] <igyiguygyu> Thanks so much Cork  & Uhkis ;)
[23:47:25] <vivekananda> I have an interesting problem. I have a running autocomplete widget. In it onKeyup I show values. These values are coming from an ajax call to the database. Now what is happening is on typing a little quickly the items in keyup execute but the values haven't been returned yet. so the key expressions think tht there is no such value but it refreshes in a bit. I can workaround this by doing async=false but I want to
[23:47:25] <vivekananda> <vivekananda> understand a better way
[23:48:07] <vivekananda> does that make sense ?
[23:49:51] <Uhkis> vivekananda: maybe you could get all the returnable values from db on pageload and use that instead of querying the db on keyup?
[23:52:01] <vivekananda> Uhkis, ahaa nice but I dont know how to do that :(. also the database has lots of data ( 1 mill and might multiply later) . Do I query the whole of it for a keyword. My intention is --- if user keys in 'mic' then I show all words in the db in the column which have the letters together eg microsoft softmic etch
[23:53:42] <Uhkis> millions of rows sounds like a dead browser
[23:55:13] <luaboy> how to get the response data by jquery
[23:55:15] <luaboy> ?
[23:55:28] <Cork> from an ajax call you mean?
