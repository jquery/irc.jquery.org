[00:00:06] <martinciscap2> bytes everyone
[00:00:13] <LoneStar99> ok gn all, thanks again everyone
[00:01:18] <ravenzz> I use netbeans but eh I would like to try sublime text 2, I wonder if it is good as well, if it takes care of maintaining the files on the dev server updated
[00:10:42] <suedoh> Hi, does anyone know if it's possible to reload a Javascript file in Chrome for example without doing an entire page refresh?
[00:15:45] <sente> i assume so
[00:15:56] <Dr-Bombay> suedoh: sounds like that might not actually be the problem you're trying to solve
[00:16:15] <Whirl3d> are there any caveats to using .replaceWith ?
[00:21:10] <Whirl3d> better yet: which be best in this scenario: I have an image that I need to manage the size of whenever the browser is resized. So I would like to wrap the image in a div and handle the loading of the div. would it be best to wrap the image element in a div directly or would it be best to detatch the image, append it to it's div and append the div back to the dom...or do a replacewith and replace the image with the div only to create a 
[00:22:35] <systemfault> Can't you just use CSS?
[00:22:43] <Whirl3d> no
[00:23:35] <Whirl3d> I've asked in the css channel about a dozen times and the end answer is no. LOL
[00:23:54] <systemfault> I see..
[00:24:04] <Whirl3d> in fact, the latest time I asked, i was told, "that's not css's job"
[00:24:04] <sacho> why all the appending and wrapping and whatever?
[00:24:15] <Whirl3d> which blew my mind..
[00:25:00] <sacho> $(window).resize(function() { // control image size here })
[00:25:10] <iateadonut> i was surprised css has no 'min-right' and we have to use javascript ffor that.
[00:25:23] <Whirl3d> well, in IE, for example, images don't do well for centering in the browser unless they are in a <span> or <div> that is part of the normal flow
[00:25:25] <sacho> min-right?
[00:27:42] <Whirl3d> I think I'll just use .wrap and attach loadhandlers to the image as it is provided rather than creating a new one to attach loadhandlers to.
[00:28:03] <systemfault> Whirl3d: text-align: center; to center an image? :/
[00:28:16] <nVee> hey guys, is there a way to append time to the jquery date picker? I dont want a user to select the time, it should just be available when posting
[00:28:43] <Whirl3d> that's the problem with IE again. If it's not in a span or div that is position:static, you are screwed.
[00:29:44] <Whirl3d> so you wrap the image in a div or span, set it to inline-block (to adjust automaticallly to the size of the iamge) and text-align center the div.
[00:30:09] <Whirl3d> the other nice part abou that is you can avoid a bunch of issues with images liking to return width=0 and height=0;
[00:31:40] <Whirl3d> plus, for my example, I want to offset the image 300px opacity 0 and slide it in to the center. That gets ugly with text-align center on the image...but set the div in the center, then offset the relative position of the image and your are set
[00:38:31] <ndss56> Whirl3d: Did you ever get the chance to complete the jsfiddle with the toys and batteries?
[00:39:33] <Whirl3d> that was so long ago....I thought we wrapped that up..
[00:39:44] <prom0> Good morning all
[00:40:56] <prom0> Is anyone in here who could provide me some help?
[00:40:57] <tdskate> morning
[00:41:06] <tdskate> maybe
[00:41:55] <prom0> I'm using Jquery in a web application, once I run the demo of the slider it works like a charm.
[00:42:08] <prom0> now I've build it in my web application and it's still working
[00:42:15] <prom0> however the style is getting messed up..
[00:42:32] <tw2113> have you included all the same stylesheets?
[00:43:36] <prom0> yes I did, the weird thing is that there is some style, but the size isn't correct somehow
[00:43:43] <prom0> let me upload a picture of it..
[00:44:55] <prom0> http://i49.tinypic.com/4ujdds.png
[00:45:00] <prom0> here is a picture of it
[00:47:00] <prom0> Is there any setting that needs to be done in the index.html? Something I might be missing?
[00:49:14] <and325346> hi can I discuss here about jquery-ui?
[00:51:01] <and325346> when I'm trying to run the example given here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio I see radiobuttons, instead of buttons. Therefore the example does not work :/
[00:52:52] <and325346> I've looked how it is done on the site (above), and I see it is achieved with CSSes rather than jQuery-UI
[00:53:57] <outsmartin> and325346: example works here
[00:54:20] <outsmartin> you disabled javascript?
[00:54:44] <and325346> <outsmartin>: can you provide a full html code example, maybe I'm something missing?
[00:55:07] <outsmartin> just post yout page in a gist
[00:55:10] <outsmartin> your
[00:55:15] <and325346> outsmartin: no it works when I coppy form from the page source code
[00:55:17] <outsmartin> or jsfiddle
[01:01:23] <gellis11> I wonder if someone can help me with a problem I have?
[01:01:57] <gellis11> I am trying to add and remove form elements in jquery depending on which radio button is selected
[01:02:03] <gellis11> my code so far is here http://jsfiddle.net/UCy8g/
[01:02:52] <xec> gellis11: note the field named javascript, and the selectboxes under choose framework
[01:03:09] <xec> gellis11: put the javascript code in the javascript file, and choose jquery from the dropdown
[01:03:50] <tw2113> i'd probably put the actual form stuff in the html and just toggle a class with the jQuery
[01:04:37] <tw2113> some class that sets it to display: none, and when clicked appropriately, display block
[01:04:40] <tw2113> something like that
[01:04:41] <and325346> outsmartin: https://gist.github.com/2971214
[01:05:42] <gellis11> tw2113: The problem is it has validation syntax in the class for a validation library so I need to remove it not just hide it otherwise it will still expect input to the field
[01:05:58] <and325346> the name of the file is buttonform.js (ofcorse)
[01:08:36] <and325346> outsmartin: the reason why I'm asking is to know how the things are working there
[01:08:55] <and325346> I like to be awere of what I'm doing :)
[01:09:10] <outsmartin> and325346: you didnt load the ui.js
[01:09:18] <outsmartin> 2 times jquery doesnt help :D
[01:10:39] <gellis11> xec: sorted the jsfiddle layout now http://jsfiddle.net/UCy8g/3/
[01:10:53] <gellis11> xec: any idea where i might be going wrong? :)
[01:11:49] <xec> gellis11: well, for starters the syntax is a bit off, appears to be an extra }); at the end, but more importantly, what exactly do you want this code to do?
[01:12:09] <xec> gellis11: you want it to do something every time you change the radiobutton selection?
[01:12:43] <gellis11> When the Hourly rate radio button is checked I want to generate the hourly rate form fields and when the flat rate button is checked I want it to remove any hourly rate form fields and generate the flat rate form fields
[01:13:18] <gellis11> I started by just hiding them using css which worked fine, but due to the validation I have on them if its hidden it still expects entry so I need to fully remove them and add them again I think
[01:13:31] <xec> gellis11: right. the code you got now is just going to run once, you will need to create an event handler that will run every time it changes instead
[01:14:06] <gellis11> xec: ok thanks, can you point me in the right direction for how to do that? :)
[01:14:20] <xec> gellis11: hiding/showing sounds like a better idea tbh, maybe consider changing the validation
[01:14:40] <nanovirus> hi all, I have a submit button with id 'submit', it get's hidden .hide(), then I want to show it again, but when I fire .show() console in inspector says TypeError: Object #submit has no method 'show'
[01:14:50] <nanovirus> any ideas wth is going down?
[01:15:12] <xec> ?change @ gellis11
[01:15:13] <caniuse> gellis11: .change(): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[01:15:27] <and325346> outsmartin: sorry, I have missed that, but now it is corrected and not working: https://gist.github.com/2971214
[01:15:35] <ProLoser|Mac_> hallo
[01:15:51] <ProLoser|Mac_> can you use wrap on disconnected DOM?
[01:16:05] <xec> ProLoser|Mac_: try it and see?
[01:16:11] <ProLoser|Mac_> i did
[01:16:13] <ProLoser|Mac_> it's not wokring
[01:16:50] <xec> ProLoser|Mac_: i thought it would... could you make a demo?
[01:17:07] <gellis11> xec: what's the recommended way to validate form fields? i'm currently using a js library called vanadium for it
[01:17:11] <and325346> outsmartin: I'm using Firefox 12.0
[01:17:47] <xec> gellis11: microsoft made a validation plugin for jquery, but i'm not sure if it's still actively developed
[01:20:15] <and325346> outsmartin: what do you think I'm doing wrong?
[01:21:38] <xec> gellis11: I'm thinking you most likely could configure your existing solution to not care about irrelevant form fields
[01:22:08] <outsmartin> and325346: no clue your best bet is to put in in a jsfiddle and link to the hosted libs so i can actually try it myself
[01:27:27] <and325346> hi
[01:27:36] <and325346> outsmartin:  http://jsfiddle.net/gJbMp/
[01:35:52] <ProLoser|Mac> anyone around?
[01:36:25] <and325346> outsmartin: I'm not sure if I included the libraries correctly
[01:36:34] <ProLoser|Mac> any ideas why this line isn't working? https://github.com/ProLoser/Rotary-Datepicker/blob/master/rotary-datepicker.js#L134
[01:39:22] <xec> ProLoser|Mac: css transform needs vendor prefix, at least in firefox and chrome afaik
[01:39:30] <Haprog> yup
[01:39:34] <Haprog> was just about to mention that
[01:39:38] <Haprog> http://caniuse.com/transforms2d
[01:40:21] <Haprog> so you need to set: -ms-transform, -moz-transform, -webkit-transform, -o-transform
[01:43:05] <outsmartin> and325346: http://jsfiddle.net/gJbMp/2/ this one works, the styles are missing but the javascript worked
[01:43:18] <outsmartin> you can see that the class ui-buttonset is added
[01:44:27] <and325346> outsmartin: no it does not work in my browser
[01:44:27] <and325346> :/
[01:44:37] <and325346> are you using firefox?
[01:44:40] <outsmartin> yep
[01:44:49] <and325346> which version?
[01:44:54] <outsmartin> 13
[01:45:03] <outsmartin> but that should not matter
[01:45:40] <and325346> hmm...
[01:46:03] <and325346> so there is something no ok, do you have an idea whats bad?
[01:48:49] <and325346> Can anyone else verify if he sees buttons or radiobuttons as output here: http://jsfiddle.net/gJbMp/2/
[01:49:25] <tw2113> i see radio buttons labeled choice 1-3
[01:49:41] <and325346> outsmartin: you see, it is not working
[01:49:43] <outsmartin> i have radios too
[01:49:47] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/53/ how can I swap the #attribute127 and attribute128 bits in the bottom 2 table.find rows for the .eq() values in the on-change?
[01:49:49] <outsmartin> i told you css doesnt work
[01:49:58] <outsmartin> you can add resources on the left
[01:50:14] <outsmartin> add the google hosted css from ui there and it works
[01:53:33] <and325346> outsmartin: now it works: http://jsfiddle.net/gJbMp/3/
[01:53:52] <and325346> so CSSes are ncessary
[01:54:40] <and325346> thanks
[01:55:19] <outsmartin> and325346: no problem you can use firebug for debugging to see whats missing
[01:56:05] <SoulRaven> hello
[01:56:07] <SoulRaven> anyone?
[01:56:13] <NodeX> 42
[01:56:25] <SoulRaven> anyone use -webkit-column-count: inside the ui dialog
[01:56:28] <SoulRaven> ?
[01:56:30] <NodeX> 42
[01:56:34] <and325346> I'm curious which CSS is for the buttons :)
[01:56:44] <and325346> I have to investigate the example
[01:57:55] <and325346> hmm but something is still not ok :/ I have CSSes
[01:59:02] <and325346> oh, I've made a mistake in including CSSes
[01:59:20] <milligan> jQuery17206636983149219304_1340355324383({"result":"true","amount":"903478","error":"none"}) <- This is a jSON response I'm getting. Then, I do: var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(data); Followed by if(obj.result==="true") { . The error is that the obj returned by jsON is null. How can that be?
[02:00:32] <milligan> nvm
[02:00:49] <milligan> The .parseJSON wasn't needed.
[02:01:24] <outsmartin> parseJSON is for strings i think
[02:01:33] <fRAiLtY-> Help, http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing the top 2 selects (1 & 2) should select the column and then row respectively. they work in the fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/56/) but not on the page. No JS errors in Chrome console either :x
[02:02:21] <fRAiLtY-> actually, fixed it
[02:02:22] <fRAiLtY-> my bad
[02:02:23] <fRAiLtY-> soz
[02:04:07] <fRAiLtY-> Hmm, http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/56 works in terms of selecting both the column AND row, however here http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing only selects the row? Drop-down 1 = column, Drop-down 2 = row.. :x
[02:04:12] <fRAiLtY-> Doesn't seem to work on my page :x
[02:06:54] <Bamubus> how to do it ? use a javascript to copy a content of textarea to a hidden field in the form
[02:07:37] <mbrochh> hey all. how can I add an element as the first element after the opening body tag?
[02:08:03] <mbrochh> hmm seems to be append
[02:08:18] <mbrochh> or no... prepend...
[02:08:20] <Zhy> prepend rather
[02:08:30] <mbrochh> thanks!
[02:08:38] <Zhy> you figured it out yourself ;)
[02:08:45] <Zhy> I just confirmed :>
[02:09:00] <Zhy> now get to it and make me proud!... oO
[02:14:04] <Frackher> Hi All :) !
[02:14:30] <codeAssassin> Hi Frackher
[02:17:32] <yogacore> anyone now what is it? --> "Component returned failure code: 0x80004001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) [nsIDOMLSProgressEvent.input]"
[02:17:40] <yogacore> *know
[02:17:47] <ProLoser|Mac> can anyone tell me why this line isn't working? https://github.com/ProLoser/Rotary-Datepicker/blob/master/rotary-datepicker.js#L134
[02:18:53] <raj> ProLoser|Mac, more info?
[02:19:01] <raj> how is it not working?
[02:20:18] <raj> anyway, this should answer your question http://stackoverflow.com/a/7936420/997624
[02:21:39] <_ramok> hi
[02:21:45] <ProLoser|Mac> raj: it's not applying that style inline
[02:21:53] <ProLoser|Mac> it applies other styles (such as color or something else)
[02:22:33] <raj> did you try it with the webkit stuff from the SO post?
[02:22:56] <ProLoser|Mac> no, but it works here: http://proloser.github.com/Rotary-Datepicker/
[02:23:09] <raj> intersting
[02:23:16] <raj> sorry, I haven't had any experience with it
[02:23:59] <raj> how can I do a transition effect on a div to fit changing content?
[02:24:12] <ProLoser|Mac> what do you mean?
[02:24:44] <ProLoser|Mac> i've been moving away from jquery animations and instead been leveraging css3
[02:24:45] <johnline> ie8 you god damned shit
[02:24:56] <raj> i'm filling content in a div in the callback of a $.post. How can I make the div slide as it enlarges to fit the content?
[02:25:21] <ProLoser|Mac> lots of calculations
[02:25:29] <ProLoser|Mac> calculate the destination height and then animate to it
[02:25:41] <ProLoser|Mac> and finally switch off the fixed height when you're done
[02:25:44] <Frackher> Mmmm I was wandering why css marginLeft return a value in px (http://jsfiddle.net/7bZhk/8/) while a css left return the value in percent (http://jsfiddle.net/Jj8Z3/2/) ? If somebody have the answer ^^/
[02:25:48] <raj> oh wow
[02:25:55] <ProLoser|Mac> this will likely cause popping if things such as padding or border aren't accounted for however
[02:26:14] <Frackher> (In fact i need a percent value)
[02:26:53] <ProLoser|Mac> Frackher: check the source code? but it seems like a stranger use-case to use margins with percentages honestly
[02:27:45] <SoulRaven> anyone use webkit-comumns inside ui dialog?
[02:27:58] <ProLoser|Mac> what's the problem?
[02:28:16] <SoulRaven> i have stranges problems with autowitdh of the dialog, when inside of him is a div with webkit-columns
[02:28:46] <Frackher> @ProLoser|Mac it's made for responsive design (on IE), it was well working with left and position:relative but I haved to fix a height, which I don't want, so i retire the position:relative, but have to use the margin-left in place of left ^^
[02:29:08] <ProLoser|Mac> calculate it manually perhaps?
[02:29:14] <Frackher> Yeah
[02:29:23] <Frackher> Calculate mannually is the solution
[02:29:48] <Frackher> but I wanted to know why there is a gap for the unite between margin left and  left so...
[02:30:06] <SoulRaven> i can't suport a live test case, but is posibile to provide user and password on PM
[02:30:21] <raj> ProLoser|Mac, so you're like an animation expert
[02:30:23] <ProLoser|Mac> no
[02:30:26] <ProLoser|Mac> i'm going to bed soon
[02:30:31] <ProLoser|Mac> raj: eh
[02:30:31] <raj> i've got the original height of the div
[02:30:37] <ProLoser|Mac> i've been doing a shit-ton of animation lately
[02:30:52] <raj> now I want to give the div a fixed height?
[02:31:05] <ProLoser|Mac> no
[02:31:11] <raj> using .css('height', x)
[02:31:35] <ProLoser|Mac> my guess (and I haven't checked how it's normally done) is you'd have to inject the content into a placeholder div, calculate what it's height comes out to be, and then animate to that number
[02:31:38] <ProLoser|Mac> on the actual div
[02:31:48] <ProLoser|Mac> then when the animation is complete, switch the height back to auto, just to be safe
[02:31:57] <SoulRaven> anyone intrested to help me?
[02:32:29] <ProLoser|Mac> if you want you can try pouring over the anythingslider code, but i don't think it uses quite the same technique, as the destination dimensions are not being populated via ajax
[02:33:04] <ProLoser|Mac> http://proloser.github.com/AnythingSlider/#&panel1-6&panel2-1
[02:33:05] <raj> there's gotta be a plugin for this
[02:33:07] <ProLoser|Mac> refer to the second slider
[02:33:17] <ProLoser|Mac> possibly
[02:33:32] <raj> oh, nice
[02:33:55] <raj> can I make a suggestion?
[02:34:05] <ProLoser|Mac> okay
[02:34:09] <raj> for the first slider, have it shift on mouse down, not on mouse up
[02:34:20] <ProLoser|Mac> why?
[02:34:29] <raj> so it holds the right-sided shift while the mouse is down
[02:34:32] <SoulRaven> in what condition minWidth from ui dialog is not honoured.
[02:34:38] <raj> and then does the left swing when the mouse goes up
[02:34:51] <ProLoser|Mac> ah
[02:34:54] <raj> but altogether fantastic
[02:35:03] <ProLoser|Mac> that would actually involve a fairly deep rewrite
[02:35:08] <fRAiLtY-> Hmm, http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/56 works in terms of selecting both the column AND row, however here http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing only selects the row? Drop-down 1 = column, Drop-down 2 = row.. :x Doesn't seem to work on my page :x
[02:35:09] <raj> oh ok
[02:35:19] <ProLoser|Mac> the 'bounce' you see is just the easing function used
[02:35:32] <ProLoser|Mac> also, i don't maintain the project anymore
[02:35:41] <ProLoser|Mac> feel free to open a bug ticket with the suggestion and someone may implement it for you
[02:35:56] <ProLoser|Mac> IMHO, the plugin has gotten way too big though due to so many stupid requests being fulfilled
[02:36:07] <ProLoser|Mac> not saying your request is stupid
[02:36:14] <raj> haha
[02:36:22] <raj> i think you jsut did!
[02:36:24] <ProLoser|Mac> just not necessarily within the scope of what the thing should be capable of doing out-of-the-box
[02:36:36] <raj> kk, fair enough
[02:36:45] <ProLoser|Mac> no, i just think what you suggest merits it's own implementation
[02:36:57] <ProLoser|Mac> the damn thing has so much scope creep, checkout the file size
[02:37:04] <ProLoser|Mac> it's like the biggest slider plugin there is
[02:37:15] <raj> yikes
[02:37:50] <ProLoser|Mac> 40kb uncompressed
[02:37:58] <ProLoser|Mac> 17 compressed
[02:38:00] <fr00d> Hello
[02:38:08] <ProLoser|Mac> that doesn't include the video or fx addons
[02:38:29] <ProLoser|Mac> most plugins are under 10kb
[02:38:43] <raj> well, addons are addons
[02:38:47] <raj> so that's the devel's choice
[02:38:52] <raj> core's gotta be tight though
[02:38:57] <fr00d> I'm loading site elements via ajax into my site. now I'd like to close this site element and defined a img with id hideChangeServer but the according click event is not executed.
[02:38:58] <raj> imo
[02:39:02] <ProLoser|Mac> well.. the maintainer now keeps adding every bloody suggestion people throw out there
[02:39:26] <SoulRaven> in what condition minWidth from ui dialog is not honoured.
[02:39:32] <ProLoser|Mac> i actually am so dissappointed with like 75% of jquery plugins i find i end up just implementing it from scratch myself in the app directly
[02:39:37] <ProLoser|Mac> usually cuts out like most of the clutter
[02:39:45] <raj> SoulRaven, do you have a live link?
[02:39:58] <fr00d> http://pastebin.com/7aLENESv This is my jquery code.
[02:40:04] <raj> ProLoser|Mac, makes you a good programmer
[02:40:05] <SoulRaven> i have a webkit-column-count: inside a ui dialog, and the dialog is not honer the minwidth set on the dialog propieties
[02:40:12] <raj> ProLoser|Mac, what kinda mac you on?
[02:40:24] <ProLoser|Mac> 15" pro
[02:40:25] <raj> I was looking into purchasing one today
[02:40:33] <raj> priced it out to 2100
[02:40:38] <ProLoser|Mac> go with a refurb
[02:40:39] <raj> for 13" mbp
[02:40:44] <raj> really?
[02:40:45] <raj> why?
[02:40:51] <ProLoser|Mac> unless you WANT something specifically found in the new version, there's no benefit
[02:41:01] <Whirl3d> go with the new one or regret it forever
[02:41:10] <ProLoser|Mac> mine is a refurb
[02:41:12] <raj> I want the SSD, 8GB RAM
[02:41:22] <ProLoser|Mac> they are practically like brand spanking new and get the same warranty
[02:41:32] <ProLoser|Mac> if you go with the new one, you're stuck with the ssd
[02:41:33] <Whirl3d> the cori7 processor and ivy bridge
[02:41:37] <ProLoser|Mac> and the ram from apple is expensive
[02:41:38] <fr00d> http://pastebin.com/TFiaW19M These are the two images where the click should happen.
[02:41:46] <ProLoser|Mac> with mine, i can install a ssd third party and ram third party
[02:41:48] <ProLoser|Mac> both cheaper
[02:41:49] <raj> yeah, corei7, that too
[02:41:57] <SoulRaven> anyone?
[02:42:06] <ProLoser|Mac> in fact, i can install 2 hard ssd hard drives, bigger than apple offers, and set them up in raid configuration
[02:42:06] <raj> SoulRaven, got some code to show?
[02:42:24] <raj> SoulRaven, there are many things that can override minwidth
[02:42:31] <raj> such as a css property being defined afterwards
[02:42:35] <ProLoser|Mac> or stupidity
[02:42:51] <Whirl3d> how about a screen resolution of 2880x1900.....that's higher resolution than offset printing on fine paper
[02:43:25] <raj> that's retina, which is not offered on 13" anyway
[02:43:28] <SoulRaven> raj: on privat, because i behinde a password
[02:43:45] <ProLoser|Mac> i'm not that impressed with retina
[02:43:47] <Whirl3d> I have a 47" monitor that I use and it's only 2560x1550
[02:43:55] <raj> ProLoser|Mac, really? why not?
[02:44:03] <ProLoser|Mac> because you don't use it in daily routine
[02:44:06] <raj> Whirl3d, that's called a TV
[02:44:13] <ProLoser|Mac> if it was a retina 47" monitor, i'd care
[02:44:17] <Whirl3d> It's a dell
[02:44:20] <Whirl3d> montior
[02:44:23] <Whirl3d> thank you
[02:44:29] <Whirl3d> lol
[02:44:34] <ProLoser|Mac> but as long as your monitor is already hi-res, i'm fine
[02:44:34] <raj> don't believe the hype
[02:44:56] <raj> so is the gfix card unbelievable to have a resolution like that?
[02:45:13] <SoulRaven> raj: if you want i can send the password and user on PM
[02:45:15] <SoulRaven> to have a look
[02:45:18] <Frackher> Opps
[02:45:18] <Whirl3d> no. it's tired and old
[02:45:24] <Frackher> Thanks ProLoser|Mac
[02:45:24] <ProLoser|Mac> as i said
[02:45:26] <ProLoser|Mac> get a refurb
[02:45:35] <Frackher> Maybe I will post a bug report on the site
[02:45:49] <raj> SoulRaven, sure
[02:46:05] <ProLoser|Mac> i'm very happy with my refurb
[02:46:08] <raj> i just really need a computer that doesn't overheat
[02:46:18] <ProLoser|Mac> and i'm able to get more bells and whistles i actually care about
[02:46:20] <Whirl3d> just lump it. If you use vim, why not just get a ti994a...with the macro modules. LOL
[02:46:20] <raj> and my lenovo t410 is currently overheating like poop
[02:46:45] <fr00d> Ah if I first load the changeServer component I can click the hideChangeServer Button and it disapears. But the addServer can't be clicked. How do I need to code that to be able to have a flip flop?
[02:46:51] <ProLoser|Mac> i got the refurb because it cost the same to get one with hi-res + bigger hd + etc etc vs getting a new one with low res monitor or low hd or low this or low that
[02:47:13] <ProLoser|Mac> if the only difference is cpu speed, are you REALLY going to actively see a difference between 2.7ghz and 2.2ghz
[02:47:19] <ProLoser|Mac> it's retarded
[02:47:31] <ProLoser|Mac> memory and hd can be upgraded, or at least it can for my generation
[02:47:32] <Whirl3d> okayy okay. why you mad, bro?
[02:48:24] <ProLoser|Mac> huh?
[02:48:54] <Whirl3d> I personally will like being able to have everything open like I do on my pc now....I have 20 gb Ram and regularly keep 10 apps open all the time. LOL
[02:49:30] <ProLoser|Mac> i believe both hdd and memory are built into the mb on the latest generation
[02:49:41] <ProLoser|Mac> meaning you would not be able to reach 20gb, and would have a hd size of 128 max
[02:49:44] <raj> all retina display mbp's cannot be opened
[02:50:00] <EoN> what's the best editable datagrid for jquery? any recommendations?
[02:50:11] <Whirl3d> 16gb is close enough
[02:50:11] <ProLoser|Mac> jgrid?
[02:50:21] <Haprog> EoN: I've used DataTables with jEditable.
[02:50:26] <ProLoser|Mac> i forgot what it's called

[03:02:59] <tocka> howdy there cowboy
[03:03:08] <Jagan> var i = "xyz"  var c = parseInt(i) its showing NaN........what is the wrong in that
[03:03:42] <KolakCC> Jagan: xyz isn't an integer..?
[03:03:49] <KolakCC> in string form
[03:04:03] <Jagan> ya
[03:04:15] <Jagan> is the anything wrong
[03:04:46] <jonno11> NaN means Not a Number
[03:05:55] <Jagan> k k
[03:06:09] <Jagan> how to remove string ""
[03:06:30] <jonno11> those are text characters
[03:06:39] <Neo> i need a small nudge in the correct direction, I have code that currently isn't working: http://pastebin.com/fS3BvKmY
[03:06:49] <jonno11> how would that translate to a integer?
[03:07:09] <Neo> throwing: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[03:07:33] <jonno11> parseInt() works like this - var i = "123"; var c = parseInt(i);
[03:07:58] <Jagan> k simply "abc" string s convert into abc only......its possible r not
[03:08:17] <Jagan> @jonnoll ya its workin fine
[03:08:31] <jonno11> what do you want to do?
[03:08:42] <Jagan> k simply "abc" string s convert into abc only......its possible r not
[03:09:09] <jonno11> You can't remove the ""… that's how javascript identifies that's a string
[03:09:55] <jonno11> the "" aren't part of the string. They're identifiers. try console.log(i)
[03:10:32] <jonno11> Neo: where are you getting the error thrown?
[03:10:48] <Neo> jonno11: jquery-latest.js:632
[03:11:08] <jonno11> I mean - what part of the code is throwing an error? Can you JSFiddle it?
[03:11:41] <Neo> looks like: $.each(data.items, function(key,value){
[03:13:41] <jonno11> You need a selector to call each() on
[03:14:21] <raj> I need a plugin that'll prepare a div to slide to a new height with its new content
[03:15:37] <jonno11> each() works on elements. So $("li").each(); will loop through each li element
[03:15:42] <Neo> jonno11: such as: $.getJSON("util.php?util.json", function(data) {
[03:15:43] <Neo>     $.each(data.items, function(key,value){
[03:16:04] <jonno11> You want to iterate through each "data" property?
[03:16:16] <jonno11> http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for_in.asp
[03:16:16] <Neo> ahhh
[03:16:31] <jonno11> see there ^
[03:16:43] <mnemoc> jonno11: ignore that site
[03:16:52] <jonno11> how come?

[04:14:17] <Lurzino> i have a json structure like: {"result":[{"address_component":[ ......],"formatted_address":"my address",.....},..... if i do §.parseJSON((data) how I can get the formatted_address field
[04:14:26] <Lurzino>  thanks in advance
[04:15:11] <xec> §?
[04:15:31] <Lurzino> yes tat dollar character.....
[04:15:54] <xec> Lurzino: are you saving the result in some var?
[04:16:38] <Lurzino> xec, yes.... var obj = parseJSON(data)
[04:16:40] <xec> Lurzino: and-- result seems to be an array? are there multiple addresses?
[04:16:58] <Lurzino> yes but i need only the first one
[04:17:19] <xec> Lurzino: to get the first item of an array you can do arr[0]
[04:17:28] <xec> Lurzino: but your sample looks weird, maybe give us a proper one
[04:18:02] <Lurzino> its an json_encoded google apis geocoding structure....
[04:18:09] <xec> Lurzino: if i were to guess, i'd say you could try obj.result[0].formatted_address
[04:19:00] <Lurzino> i tried that but it says cannot read property '0' of undefined
[04:19:21] <xec> ?csb
[04:19:46] <xec> Lurzino: cool story. give us a proper sample?
[04:20:19] <Lurzino> of the structure?....

[04:33:30] <Lurzino> which is very strange since if I do alert(obj) it returns the whole structure
[04:34:24] <xec> Lurzino: console.dir(data) and inspect it?
[04:35:05] <xec> Lurzino: i don't think you need the parseJSON line
[04:35:46] <Lurzino> but the obj contains the whole json structure though as i pastebined to you...
[04:36:05] <xec> Lurzino: as a string?
[04:36:13] <Lurzino> yes
[04:36:27] <xec> Lurzino: normally, alert() will just display [object Object] if you pass it an object
[04:36:48] <xec> Lurzino: what happens if you log the data var to console
[04:37:59] <Lurzino> i consoled the data and it returns like plenty of lines of each character of the json jstructure
[04:40:20] <Lurzino> xec i consoled also the obj thing parsejsoned and returns same thing as data in the console....
[04:41:02] <xec> Lurzino: i dunno what to tell you, mate - the sample you gave me works fine in the fiddle i pasted you
[04:43:18] <Lurzino> yes i saw....you said i couldn't need to use parsejson really....what would be your alternate suggest?
[04:47:34] <xec> Lurzino: what i meant was that you could probably just use the data object directly
[04:47:46] <xec> Lurzino: like, data.results....
[04:47:55] <Lurzino> ok lemme try.....
[04:49:51] <Lurzino> still says data.results is undefined.... really wierd!!!
[04:50:52] <xec> Lurzino: even if you just do console.log(data.results) ?
[04:51:18] <rabbi1> var checkEmpty = $('input[name="txtCorpHQLocation"]:blank'); is this correct? else how can i add true or false after checking the condition ?
[04:52:54] <xec> rabbi1: what exactly are you trying to do? check if an input is empty?
[04:53:19] <Lurzino> xec..... console.log(data.results) says undefined.... weird
[04:53:51] <xec> Lurzino: but you see the results property when you do console.log(data) ?
[04:53:59] <Lurzino> yes
[04:54:08] <xec> are you sure?
[04:54:11] <xec> :P

[05:04:05] <fuchstronaut> nothing, I'm fine :-)
[05:04:15] <codeAssassin> you figured it out yourself ?
[05:04:33] <ravenzz> ?parseJSON @ Lurzino
[05:04:34] <bot-t> Lurzino, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/

[05:05:30] <codeAssassin> np Lurzino good luck
[05:05:47] <Lurzino> had to do getJSON then again parseJSON
[05:06:15] <codeAssassin> ;)
[05:06:55] <codeAssassin> this happens when they send it with application/json and you're trying to fetch text/html
[05:06:56] <ravenzz> btw you can use get, be sure to specify the dataType
[05:07:16] <seutje> odd, getJSON is suppose to already parse it
[05:07:32] <codeAssassin> seutje: i was thinking the same thing though
[05:07:45] <codeAssassin> ?getJSON
[05:07:45] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[05:07:59] <seutje> "The success callback is passed the returned data, which is typically a JavaScript object or array as defined by the JSON structure and parsed using the $.parseJSON() method. It is also passed the text status of the response."
[05:08:33] <seutje> never liked these convenience methods
[05:08:34] <codeAssassin> i was about to paste the same thing lol

[05:57:16] <fuchstronaut> Can you guys point me to a documentation of tablesorter's pager extension?
[06:05:05] <tocka> Did anyone had a problem with $.post() in IE7?
[06:05:06] <tocka> :/
[06:05:11] <tocka> my isnt posting anything dammit
[06:08:31] <fRAiLtY-> Hi guys, if you choose drop-down 1 and drop-down 2 it works nicely, selects a column and a row. drop-down 3 issues an AJAx request and returns possibly a "new" table, then it loses the column/row select. How to maintain/reapply this on ajax load? http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[06:10:08] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/NR29t/12/
[06:10:19] <Trisox> i want to overwrite validateMe and use $("#errorContainer");
[06:10:26] <Trisox> for validation messages
[06:11:22] <varnie> good day.
[06:11:28] <Trisox> bye
[06:11:36] <varnie> is $(this).css('display', ''); equivalent to $(this).hide(); ?
[06:11:48] <Trisox> no
[06:11:52] <seutje> no
[06:11:53] <varnie> err. $(this).show();
[06:11:58] <Trisox> no
[06:12:05] <_trev> $(this).css('display', 'none')
[06:12:12] <_trev> $(this).css('display', 'block')
[06:12:12] <Trisox> yup
[06:12:18] <Trisox> or inline-block
[06:12:21] <_trev> right
[06:12:22] <Trisox> depends on the element ;)
[06:12:26] <seutje> I think $(this).css('display', '') wouldn't actually do anything
[06:12:33] <Trisox> nope
[06:12:45] <Trisox> $(this).css('display') would
[06:13:04] <varnie> it is the same as this.style.display = ""
[06:13:13] <Trisox> seutje: any knowlege about jquery validate?
[06:13:40] <seutje> varnie: hmz, ur right, it removes any inline display style
[06:13:51] <seutje> Trisox: this is my first day using jQuery
[06:13:52] <Trisox> mmm realy
[06:13:53] <razec> Hi guys
[06:14:01] <Trisox> no its not
[06:14:04] <varnie> thanks for helping me out
[06:15:52] <razec> Where I found an example using 'flip toggle switch (jquery-mobile)' and javascript (Get a value from flip toggle) when toggle is pressed?
[06:16:37] <Trisox> ?.touch
[06:16:39] <bot-t> Trisox, Couldn't find ".touch" in jQuery Docs.
[06:16:45] <Trisox> nm
[06:17:37] <christo_m> shoky: what did you say the culprit could be for that "body is undefined" thing?
[06:17:56] <christo_m> im ajax loading a full calendar. not sure why it happens sometimes, other times it doesnt
[06:28:15] <Nece228> hello
[06:28:45] <Nece228> i have a lot of inputs which have integer value eg
[06:29:17] <Nece228> input id="price" value="50"; input id="price" value="15" etc
[06:29:19] <QueueQueue> @christo_m I missed some of what you said, but if you're having inconsistencies, and you're using ajax you should be wary of when code is running in your process as ajax is async
[06:29:29] <Nece228> i need to get the values of each and sum them
[06:29:37] <Nece228> im assuming i should do something like:
[06:29:40] <seutje> ?parseint @ Nece228
[06:29:42] <bot-t> Nece228, remove "parseInt" and speed up some div - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4311
[06:29:50] <seutje> the fuck
[06:29:54] <seutje> ?mdn parseint
[06:29:55] <bot-t> seutje, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[06:30:00] <seutje> STOP DOING THAT
[06:30:15] <Nece228> $('#price').each
[06:30:35] <seutje> that will only match a single element EVER
[06:30:39] <Nece228> and then something like: var sum += $(this) right?
[06:31:14] <seutje> first off, consider using a class or some other way to match your elements, IDs are suppose to be unique
[06:31:32] <Nece228> well ok, whats new
[06:31:35] <Nece228> *next?
[06:31:38] <seutje> second, u can't just add jQuery object, u need to grab the value and parseInt it
[06:31:44] <seutje> so...
[06:32:24] <seutje> var sum = 0; $('.inputs').each(function(){ sum += parseInt($(this).val(), 10); });
[06:32:37] <seutje> where "inputs" would be your class name
[06:32:46] <Nece228> hmm thats what i thinked about
[06:32:48] <track0x1> why is it that whenever i call animate, or fadeIn/out... jquery seems to set the div to overflow: hidden?
[06:32:51] <Nece228> thanks for clearing this out
[06:32:59] <track0x1> and then once it finishes the animation, it removes the attribute.
[06:33:09] <track0x1> is there a way to disable this or stop this from happening?
[06:33:14] <seutje> Nece228: the parseInt isn't entirely necessary (I think), but it's just good practice
[06:33:44] <Nece228> well, ok ill keep that in mind, thanks
[06:37:22] <seutje> track0x1: I believe it's only set when the animation initializes, so you should be able to unset it right away
[06:37:41] <seutje> like $(foo).animate({stuff:otherstuff}).css('overflow', '');
[06:37:43] <track0x1> i think i just found a fix, by setting overflow: visible !important on the element that i'm animating
[06:38:02] <seutje> I guess that's a bit nastier
[06:38:08] <track0x1> nastier!?
[06:38:27] <seutje> yeah, u know, second step from nasty to nastiest :D
[06:38:37] <track0x1> what is the cleanest?
[06:38:52] <seutje> coz then u'll have a forced overflow in your CSS *and* an inline style on the element
[06:39:30] <seutje> not sure what the cleanest is, but just unsetting the inline style right away seems less nasty to me, personally
[06:39:45] <track0x1> inline? or overflow?
[06:39:50] <seutje> but by all means, if you feel comfortable using !important, go for it
[06:40:05] <seutje> no, by inline style I mean a style attribute on the element
[06:40:11] <track0x1> oh
[06:41:26] <track0x1> seutje: if i set it right after animate is called, the hidden overflow seems to override it
[06:41:39] <track0x1> maybe this will do me http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2648
[06:41:50] <track0x1> what do you think of comment #3?
[06:42:28] <seutje> track0x1: yea, suppose u can do it on step
[06:45:10] <seutje> track0x1: seems to work for me though: http://jsfiddle.net/u8hRA/
[06:45:58] <track0x1> if you watch it in the element inspector
[06:46:44] <seutje> track0x1: oh u mean after the animation is done?
[06:47:04] <seutje> no overflow prop on there though
[06:47:19] <track0x1> no, what happens is element has no overflow specified (visible)
[06:47:27] <track0x1> animation starts and sets overflow: hidden
[06:47:32] <seutje> isn't that what you were going for?
[06:47:40] <track0x1> and then when it finishes, hidden attribute is removed
[06:48:13] <track0x1> i think for now i'll just do !important, even tho it might be 'dirty'
[06:48:24] <seutje> no, it removes the overflow prop right after it starts the animation
[06:48:24] <track0x1> i'm in the process of recoding my website from the ground up
[06:48:29] <seutje> it isn't defined as a callback
[06:48:37] <track0x1> it doesn't when i test it
[06:48:40] <seutje> so it doesn't wait for the animation to finish
[06:48:50] <track0x1> sec
[06:48:52] <track0x1> !jsfiddle
[06:48:54] <track0x1> grr
[06:48:56] <seutje> what are u trying it on?
[06:49:03] <track0x1> let me show an example
[06:49:47] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/u8hRA/1/
[06:50:08] <seutje> there, u can see it's set to visible when the animation is going
[06:51:04] <Carlitta87> hi guys....i used mbGallery to create a slide show on this page http://demo.devmediastudios.com/cbjamaica/nmcms.php?snippet=properties&p=viewpropertydetails&pid=14180&mls=1583 but it keeps squishing my slide ONLY IN CHROME....dont know why...its a little weird. I would appreciate any advise. i think its possible to paste it in jsfiddle but not sure since i used more than one query to  do it....
[06:51:22] <track0x1> lol
[06:51:26] <seutje> track0x1: but by all means, if u wanna go for the !important, go for it
[06:51:31] <track0x1> sec
[06:52:09] <seutje> Carlitta87: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[06:52:28] <sean`> no money
[06:52:48] <seutje> arrows seem to work fine in my chromium though
[06:53:31] <seutje> prev button acts a bit funky though, feels rather random
[06:55:27] <Carlitta87> seutje: mmm, i could look into that but why dud it squish in chromee like that
[06:55:36] <Carlitta87> its completely fine in firefox n safari
[06:57:18] <track0x1> whoa weird
[06:57:25] <track0x1> in my example it is working
[06:58:13] <jeffsmykil> Is there a good way to tell what dom item the cursor is currently over?
[06:59:14] <track0x1> this is so weird!
[06:59:37] <jeffsmykil> trying to get mousewheel to work and its only working with $(body)
[07:00:18] <track0x1> seutje: ah! apparently you can't have a .delay call or else it messes with the css attribute override
[07:01:50] <track0x1> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/8TdzP/ inspect the element .block as it goes to make the block smaller... you will notice overflow: hidden ends up getting set instead... but on the other animation (expanding) there is no delay and the override works
[07:02:18] <danzik17> jeffsmykil: you can try document.elementFromPoint, or $( ":hover" ) in browsers that support it.
[07:02:55] <jeffsmykil> danzik17: I think I found the issue, it seems that since the element im attaching mousewheel to isn't in the dom when it loads it isn't firing
[07:07:41] <Surrealis> I have a table row with multiple cascading drop down which all have change events on them. Is it possible to know when all the events on the row are done firing then fire off something else?
[07:12:09] <track0x1> seutje: i found a good solution... addClass with the !important, and remove it after animation complete!
[07:13:14] <keirlav87> i'm loading a page into a UI dialog, but because the page has stylesheets in it, it's breaking the rest of my page's layout, is there a way I can contain this?
[07:15:49] <tocka> Does $.post() function in IE doesnt work?
[07:16:00] <tocka> It works perfectly in FF, Chrome and other browsers
[07:16:10] <tocka> Oh and im doing a post to another url
[07:17:47] <seutje> track0x1: ah, didn't know about the delay thing
[07:18:45] <seutje> tocka: check the content-type header in the response
[07:19:09] <seutje> IE no like xml+xhtml iirc
[07:19:38] <track0x1> ah sweet this works perfectly!
[07:19:48] <tocka> seutje
[07:19:50] <tocka> thats the header
[07:19:50] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/DYJ9Xgts
[07:20:24] <zoned> Surrealis, are you loading the data from an ajax call? do you just need a callback for the change function?
[07:20:39] <fRAiLtY-> Hi guys, if you choose drop-down 1 and drop-down 2 it works nicely, selects a column and a row. drop-down 3 issues an AJAx request and returns possibly a "new" table, then it loses the column/row select. How to maintain/reapply this on ajax load? http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[07:20:53] <seutje> tocka: hm, and what's ur call look like?
[07:21:58] <zoned> fRAiLtY-, what do you mean it loses the column/row select?
[07:22:30] <Jagan> @fRAiLtY functionality wise or design wise
[07:23:24] <Surrealis> zoned: well i have 4 dropdown, they all have children drop down. when one is changed it will change at least 1 other dropdown, which will then fire off another onchange. the problem is that at the end of all this changing, i want todo a ajax call to post data somewhere only once. right now it is firing at least twice, once for the parent and once for the child, but in some case it fires 4 (great grand parent changed)
[07:24:15] <zoned> so..... only fire the ajax if options 1,2,3 are selected, and on option3.change
[07:24:57] <Surrealis> well if 2 is changed 3 and 4 will also change, but i need a final event to fire when all the changing is done
[07:25:06] <zoned> aren't they dependent on one another?
[07:25:15] <zoned> so if you change 1, you'll have to go back and change 2/3?
[07:25:24] <Surrealis> yeah, but they have default data
[07:25:30] <Surrealis> which they also want to capture
[07:25:53] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: you can set a variable in the local scope and use that in your success handler, or you can stick it on the jqxhr object and extract it in your success handler
[07:26:08] <zoned> Surrealis, so manually call .change then
[07:26:09] <keirlav87> if i load a full html page inline, i.e. from <html>to</html> is there a way to prevent it from breaking my layout?
[07:26:25] <NoiseEee> keirlav87: no, as that would be totally invalid html.
[07:26:39] <NoiseEee> keirlav87: unless you put it in an iframe
[07:26:57] * Woet throws up
[07:27:09] <Woet> did someone mention an ancient technique from the egyptian age?
[07:27:15] * Woet looks at NoiseEee
[07:27:35] <NoiseEee> i think you'd be surprised how many iframes are in use on various popular and modern sites Woet :)
[07:27:45] <NoiseEee> anyways yeah 'fetching an entire page' is usually a smell
[07:27:49] <Woet> nearly always as hacks to work around issues though
[07:27:52] <Woet> not for actual usage
[07:27:57] <Surrealis> zoned: like this, 1 is changed, which manually calls .change on 2, which manually calls change on 3, which manually call change on 4. when all this is done. i want to fire off an ajax call
[07:28:22] <seutje> exteme situations call for extreme measures?
[07:28:35] <keirlav87> i'm creating a page on the server side, and want to return it back to the client for printing, what would be the best method?
[07:30:00] <NoiseEee> redirect them to the new page?
[07:30:26] <fuchstronaut> (keirlav87): what NoiseEee said
[07:31:10] <keirlav87> simple answers are usually the best - include the css file on the main page, then encapsulate its css to within "#print_dialog" seems to work
[07:32:27] <keirlav87> redirect them  to new pages? in this day and age where everything is done in situ? surely not :P
[07:32:38] <kavelot> I have many <input> fields in my form with same name (id <input name="a" value="10"><input name="a" value="20">) and I want to join them all in single comma-separated fields (<input name="a" value="10,20">... any ideas on how to do it?
[07:33:05] <Surrealis> zoned: so what is happening is 2, 3, 4 are having their .change event fired pretty much right away, and i end up have 3 ajax postback instead.
[07:57:03] <Seanmcn> Hi guys, I'm having problem with jQuery .post()'s and document.ready(); Basically I have a dynamic to-do list being populated by PHP. I'm using jQuery to change between "group" pages, this works however once I change the jQuery to update weither a task is complete doesn't work anymore? Any ideas? I've put up the relevant code here: http://jsfiddle.net/SuyNT/1/ but it isn't running due to nowhere to grab data from!
[08:01:13] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: what does this have to dow ith document ready?
[08:02:02] <Seanmcn> Well my best guess is whats happening is the DOM is changing therefore invalidating everything in document.ready since that doesnt get called again
[08:02:17] <Seanmcn> If I'm wrong please let me know, it just seems the only logical problem! xD
[08:02:56] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: what doesn't it do because its hard to see without it actually running
[08:03:21] <Seanmcn> Well basically I have it so when you check a checkbox it just strikthrough's that and updates the DB to say "complete"
[08:03:34] <Seanmcn> but once i load one of these "task_groups" which basically reloads the page without doing it
[08:03:39] <Seanmcn> Nothing happens
[08:06:23] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: could be because you aren't attaching the click event after "Reloading"
[08:06:37] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: so basicly the new elements do not have an onClick event
[08:07:26] <codeAssassin> is that making any sense?
[08:07:59] <Seanmcn> Well yes and no, shouldn't they still be binded?
[08:10:51] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: one moment, i'll make somehting
[08:11:20] <PhanLord_> is there a yield() like call that allows browser to do layouting before further processing ?
[08:14:02] <seutje> PhanLord_: like delay?
[08:15:11] <track0x1> seutje: i think he means before rendering the actual page instead of changing elements around after the page loads
[08:15:23] <PhanLord_> well the issue is following, i draw into a canvas on jquerymobile footer and i dont see anything changed unless i modify height of the whole container for example
[08:16:11] <PhanLord_> how ever if i add 1 remove 1 from height one after the other it doesnt have same efect as if i do it manually (i think chrome just ignores both actions as there is no result)
[08:16:46] <fRAiLtY-> zoned:  ?
[08:17:12] <zoned> fRAiLtY-, brb sorry
[08:17:20] <fRAiLtY-> kk
[08:18:39] <seutje> that is peculiar
[08:19:11] <fRAiLtY-> FYI, what I mean is.. select 1 grabs the row, select 2 grabs the column, select 3 refreshes the table via AJAX, then when the table is returned the column/row highlighting is gone :x
[08:19:57] <s-Code> the returned ajax code may have links to css files stripped
[08:20:03] <Whirl3d> jeesh, fRAiLtY-, you just need to store the row and column data in an object that isn't refreshed by the ajac
[08:20:04] <seutje> gotta run
[08:20:21] <Whirl3d> then at the end of the ajax call, reapply the stored row and column
[08:21:44] <Whirl3d> so do something like this:
[08:21:51] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: im out of time, i need to go
[08:21:59] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: http://jsfiddle.net/SuyNT/4/, it ALMOST works
[08:22:09] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: but this will solve your problem bro
[08:23:31] <Whirl3d> $(thirdbutton").click(function () {var row=$("tr.selected").index(); var col=$("td.selected").index(); $("table").parent().data({row:row, col:col}); doAjax();
[08:25:13] <Whirl3d> and in your ajax code you have the success handler which builds the new table...so you add to the ajax call: $.ajax(url, {succcess: function (data) {buildTable(data); var row=table.parent().data"row"; //put your highlight row/col code here}});
[08:26:35] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: http://jsfiddle.net/SuyNT/5/ it's fixed. got to go now
[08:26:40] <codeAssassin> Seanmcn: may the force be with you
[08:36:35] <mikunos> hi guys
[08:36:55] <iateadonut> man, jquery sure makes javascript easy
[08:36:56] <mikunos> why this command doesn't work:
[08:37:00] <mikunos> $('#submit').live('click', function() { $("form:first").submit(); });
[08:37:15] <mikunos> my link id is called submit
[08:37:21] <iateadonut> why .live ?
[08:37:27] <iateadonut> i usually use .on or .bind
[08:37:34] <iateadonut> i think .on is what you'd want to use.
[08:37:40] <iateadonut> i don't know - my first guess.
[08:37:47] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Here's the actual code
[08:37:52] <mikunos> if I paste it in the console of firebug it workd
[08:37:56] <mikunos> works
[08:37:59] <MagmaRules> Hi there ppl
[08:38:06] <fRAiLtY-> The 2nd portion of the JS get's the row/cols. The first bits does the AJAX call.
[08:38:10] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/4132945
[08:38:25] <iateadonut> do you only have one element with id='submit' in your page?
[08:38:33] <mikunos> yes I have
[08:38:36] <MagmaRules> Isn't $.get asynchronous and non blocking? I'm executing a javascript intensive function on its callback and the browser blocks =(
[08:38:52] <mikunos> also this doesn't work $('#submit').on('click', function() { $("form:first").submit(); });
[08:39:41] <teewuane> MagmaRules: have you specified "async: False" on any of your other methods?
[08:39:57] <MagmaRules> teewuane:  inn don't think so
[08:40:27] <teewuane> MagmaRules: to ensure that it is async, specify async: true
[08:40:33] <MagmaRules> ok
[08:40:41] <mikunos> any idea?
[08:40:51] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, I'm almost done reworking it for you.
[08:41:31] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  ?
[08:42:00] <fRAiLtY-> How'd you mean?
[08:42:19] <teewuane> MagmaRules: this is interesting, as of jQuery 1.8, the use of async: false is deprecated. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:42:30] <mikunos> any idea?
[08:45:56] <Epik> Morning everyone, Im baffled trying to figure out why in IE only, my $.ajax call breaks. -> http://jsfiddle.net/SYKJW/1/ Anyone able to shed some light on this?
[08:46:40] <MagmaRules> teewuane: yup its async, its just the library (jsplumb) is drawing a ton of sag/canvas and seems to block the browser =(
[08:46:54] <GreekFreak> hi all
[08:47:07] <GreekFreak> I'm trying to set up a custom theme for jQuery with Rails that I downloaded off ThemeRoller. From what I understand, if I install the jquery-ui-rails gem it uses only the defaults. WIll I not be downloading double the files if I add the custon themes as well?
[08:47:44] <TheIronSky> OY!!
[08:47:53] <TheIronSky> I have no answers for any of you.
[08:48:07] <TheIronSky> You're welcome.
[08:48:09] <teewuane> MagmaRules: dang. just from playing with their demo page that library looks pretty sweet though
[08:48:44] <GreekFreak> TheIronSky, lol thanks for trying at least :P
[08:49:05] <MagmaRules> teewuane:  its very good, i ran into this problem because i have around 50 connections
[08:49:14] <Epik> GreekFreak, Can you not just replace the default UI with your custom one?
[08:49:25] <MagmaRules> The think is i don't mind it taking a little longer, but it can't block the browser
[08:49:45] <TheIronSky> You can replace files on your hard drive. Computers are magical that way.
[08:50:02] <lost123> i have a slideshow which has a vertical line of thumbs, it disappears when sliding, can someone see and check http://tinyurl.com/7hq7lz2
[08:50:17] <lost123> the thumbs dont show for next loop
[08:50:24] <GreekFreak> Epik, it's in a gem. I suppose I could add the js and css files manually, but then I'd have to manually go and get the new versions
[08:50:39] <GreekFreak> Just wondering if anyone in here has worked with Rails too
[08:51:21] <TheIronSky> I used to use rails
[08:51:38] <TheIronSky> but then I realized that that's cheating in bowling, so I stopped
[08:52:53] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, your code is too spread out and crazy (prolly cause of all the extras) So this isn't a great working example (no css) but you can look at the code and it should make more sense: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/g58J6/8/
[08:53:36] <Whirl3d> basically, great a function that applys the row highlght and stores the row number in the container's data object that doesn't get refreshed by ajax
[08:53:45] <Whirl3d> then do the same for highlight column
[08:54:19] <Whirl3d> then when you refresh the table and want to re-highlight the row/colum you just look them up and reapply those functions
[08:54:32] <Epik> Whirl3d, how are you today? :)
[08:54:54] <Whirl3d> A little stressed, my friend, how are you?
[08:55:11] <Epik> Pretty much the same!
[08:56:02] <Epik> Whirl3d, You have a moment to  help me solve a $.ajax issue in IE?
[08:56:08] <mobilegamelabs> anyone have experience in using fb api?
[08:56:21] <Epik> mobilegamelabs, whats the problem?
[08:56:33] <Whirl3d> Epik, I was just looking at it. I have no idea. It looks pretty sound.
[08:56:38] <Whirl3d> You say it's only happening in IE
[08:56:42] <Whirl3d> all versions?
[08:56:55] <Epik> Yeah, ONLY in IE, all versions. Ill pm you a link, you can see what happens
[08:57:10] <Whirl3d> sounds good.
[08:57:26] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY- did you look at what I posted?
[08:57:40] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Sorry yes just sat back down, thanks very much will try and suss it out
[09:01:11] <mobilegamelabs> Epik: hey!
[09:01:25] <mobilegamelabs> is it possible to use fb api with setting up a server?
[09:02:05] <Epik> Thats a pretty generic question.. im sure it is...
[09:02:21] <Epik> though i really have no idea what you're actually trying to ask
[09:02:34] <TheIronSky> can't you just run WampServer?
[09:02:58] <GreekFreak> TheIronSky, haha. I like your analogy :P
[09:03:53] <mobilegamelabs> well, i wonder if a standalone app can let users login fb connect without an intermediate server
[09:04:02] <mobilegamelabs> so i don't need to maintain a web server
[09:04:18] <TheIronSky> more of a double entendre than an analogy, but I am glad you finally understood it.
[09:04:26] <mobilegamelabs> e.g. to do simple things like inviting friends to use
[09:04:32] <TheIronSky> uh
[09:04:38] <TheIronSky> that's interesting.
[09:04:43] <mobilegamelabs> yup
[09:04:48] <TheIronSky> I thought most of the facebook api could be used through facebook
[09:04:56] <mobilegamelabs> oh!
[09:05:42] <TheIronSky> at least that's what I've been lead to believe.
[09:05:54] <Epik> THE api is and can be hosted by fb, but how you're going to serve it to your friends.. well thats gunna require some kind of development which means some kind of server
[09:06:06] <mobilegamelabs> but i remember when setting a fb app, you got to fill in a web server address
[09:06:11] <TheIronSky> *led
[09:07:01] <TheIronSky> What facebook app are we talking about?
[09:07:16] <TheIronSky> What are you trying to accomplish?
[09:07:57] <mobilegamelabs> Epik: i see! i guess fb doesn't provide server service, right?
[09:08:12] <mobilegamelabs> TheIronSky: i am going to implement fb api into my mobile game
[09:08:24] <mobilegamelabs> so that users can login and invite friends to use
[09:08:52] <TheIronSky> HTML5 game? Or just some kind of Apple Objective-C spinoff?
[09:09:15] <mobilegamelabs> TheIronSky: objc
[09:09:21] <TheIronSky> I'm sure there's a good tutorial or thread about it on the apple/android forums.
[09:09:39] <TheIronSky> I've not worked with either systems, so I'm not really familiar
[09:09:45] <mobilegamelabs> yes i know the part on objc
[09:10:24] <mobilegamelabs> but basically each request to fb will need to reach a server through the fb proxy
[09:10:33] <mobilegamelabs> the serve will do the business logic
[09:10:50] <mobilegamelabs> i am wondering if there is an easier solution
[09:12:45] <TheIronSky> doubtful
[09:12:59] <TheIronSky> facebook is not the most dev-friendly site out there
[09:13:30] <mobilegamelabs> thanks anyway
[09:13:32] <TheIronSky> I'm sure someone's figured some solution out, though. Might have to run server software, though.
[09:13:52] <mobilegamelabs> yup, i think will need a server
[09:13:52] <TheIronSky> check out WampServer to be sure. Localhost might lead to your solution.
[09:14:06] <mobilegamelabs> ah,
[09:14:56] <mobilegamelabs> i am reading about how to use app engine with fb
[09:15:02] <mobilegamelabs> google appengine
[09:15:16] <TheIronSky> That might do the trick.
[09:27:00] <Seanmcn> Can you use FB on localhost? I always assumed you need a web address for anything with an API
[09:27:29] <TheIronSky> I think that's what we're trying to figure out.
[09:40:20] <relipse> how do i append an onchange handler for each of my radio boxes named foo?
[09:48:53] <X-tonic> I have a class called "foo". I want to have an click function associated with it. However, not elements of "foo" are not when document is ready. They are populated only later through AJAX. So how do I go about writing jquery for .foo ?
[09:52:40] <sacho_> not elements are not.
[09:52:46] <sacho_> X-tonic, read live() and on()
[09:52:56] <sacho_> ('s documentation)
[09:53:03] <X-tonic> I read on()
[09:53:11] <pachet> X-tonic : just bind to those elements when you actually add them :[
[09:53:13] <NoiseEee> X-tonic: $('#someParentOfAllThingsWithFooClass').on('click','.foo',function() { alert('clicked'); });
[09:54:35] <X-tonic> NoiseEee: even if .foo isnt initialy there?
[09:54:46] <pachet> i thought you said you read .on
[09:54:49] <pachet> ;[
[09:55:06] <NoiseEee> X-tonic: its called event delegation
[09:57:12] <X-tonic> Thanks, it worked..
[09:57:21] <X-tonic> I had read but didnt understand
[09:57:24] <X-tonic> :(
[10:04:58] <sacho_> X-tonic, read live()'s documentation
[10:05:34] <relipse> is there an easy way to select a radio box, for example myformname.setValue('hobo') would select the radio box with value 'hobo' ?
[10:06:09] <NoiseEee> relipse: .val()  also there's api.jquery.com
[10:06:46] <relipse> so val() will work correctly with radio boxes?
[10:07:17] <relipse> $('input[name=missions_monthly_amount]:radio').val('other'); ?
[10:08:11] <pachet> do you mean *set* the value? or *select* the element with that value :[
[10:09:41] <relipse> select the element with that value
[10:09:54] <relipse> since radio boxes are so annoying to work with
[10:10:40] <pachet> just use an attribute selector, like you already had for name
[10:11:25] <relipse> oh
[10:11:28] <pachet> $('input[value="foo"]')
[10:11:46] <relipse> .checked = true ?
[10:12:06] <pachet> $(':checked')
[10:12:19] <relipse> no i want to make it checked aka selected
[10:13:40] <NoiseEee> $('input[value="foo"]').prop('checked',true)
[10:14:04] <pachet> ^
[10:14:32] * pachet pats NoiseEee on the head for not doing ('checked', 'checked')
[10:18:40] <mcsquibs> how can i handle dynamically added objects by ajax
[10:20:40] <relipse> NoiseEee, pachet: how do I do a value="foo" AND a name="bar" ?
[10:22:00] <pachet> $('input[name="bar"][value="foo"]');
[10:23:33] <mcsquibs> how do i capture the submit of a form that was created by ajax
[10:23:56] <relipse> thanks
[10:24:51] <pachet> mcsquibs: bind to it when you add it to the dom
[10:24:55] <pachet> or use .on if you're feeling lazy
[10:25:30] <mcsquibs> i heard bind was outdated but how would i use the on
[10:25:44] <pachet> ?.on
[10:25:45] <bot-t> pachet, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:25:56] <pachet> that page can probably tell you ^
[10:27:00] <mcsquibs> so i would do an .on("submit")??
[10:27:53] <relipse> wow jquery is fun
[10:28:50] <johnline> i have got it
[10:28:53] <johnline> http://cache0.bigcartel.com/product_images/63936109/catch-it-for-gods-sake.gif
[10:31:06] <pachet> mcsquibs : $parent.on('submit.mynamespace', 'form', someFunction)
[10:31:45] <mcsquibs> will it catch it if it wasn't originally there though?
[10:32:37] <mcsquibs> i have a link that dynamically adds the page to the screen which has the form
[10:32:41] <pachet> that's the beauty of delegation
[10:33:08] <pachet> beauty in the same sense that a remote control that can also order a pizza delivery might be beautiful
[10:33:14] <pachet> by which i mean, enabling of laziness
[10:46:56] <ogk1000> is there anyway to do this better? $('#nav a.active').parent().prev('li').find('a').click();
[10:47:12] <ogk1000> I tried.next and .nextAll but no luck
[10:47:15] <phlx> I have 2 .js files one is for form validation and the other is a colorbox overlay. If you don't know javascript will this be an impossible task to find out whats causing the problem?
[10:52:37] <phlx> Anyone know of a simple html form validation script? I its for dropdowns only. Just need to make sure that they select an item
[11:00:58] <yedimind> phlx, you can use mine if you'd like http://projects.pud.ca/validajtor/
[11:01:13] <FunnyLookinHat> phlx, $('select').each(function() { if( $(this).val().length == 0 { // Do something } });
[11:01:51] <FunnyLookinHat> yedimind, nice styling on that page!
[11:01:56] <FunnyLookinHat> I really like it
[11:02:20] <yedimind> feel free to repurpose
[11:04:03] <fr0stbyte> anyone know of a small plugin or tutorial on a slider similar to this? http://o7.no/NhWCar hovering over the arrows slides it left/right. just hoping to avoid doing it manually (maybe somethign that works on ipad already)
[11:14:42] <bjensen> what the…uploadify costs 5 usd but is open source? how am I suppose to know if its good when they charge me 5usd before I can download it...lol
[11:16:08] <paul_irish> hihihihi
[11:16:11] <paul_irish> https://www.facebook.com/pages/jQuery/401359519910947 can everyone LIKE this page
[11:16:28] <paul_irish> jquery has to wrestle it from some dude, but facebook needs to see it have lots of likes for it to be legit . or something
[11:16:42] <paul_irish> (if you have facebook that is. props to those who dont)
[11:19:12] * tw2113 has nothing to lose with hitting like
[11:19:20] <paul_irish> we need to get to 25
[11:23:28] <bjensen> what do you guys use to upload files with?
[11:29:23] <draginx> $('body').bind('go', function(){ if i have this.. and I do $('body').trigger('go'); ... it doesnt actually trigger
[11:29:24] <draginx> any idea why?
[11:32:03] <pachet> draginx: can you make a fiddle demonstrating your problem?
[11:32:50] <draginx> hmmm not realllllyyy i could past the code though
[11:32:54] <draginx> but let me try $(document).ready :)
[11:32:54] <Chopps> hey guys, is .clone() exact same thing as regular js cloneNode() ??
[11:34:50] <pachet> Chopps: no
[11:35:42] <Chopps> pachet can u tell me the main difference between them please?
[11:36:27] <draginx> pachet: http://pastie.org/private/djgz7c9ij1zc9wmvjcjxgg so line 22 works just fine
[11:36:30] <draginx> but 28 doesnt
[11:39:04] <pachet> Chopps: you can peruse the source code and see exactly what it does:
[11:39:05] <pachet> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L566
[11:39:18] <kolix> hi guys
[11:39:20] <pachet> it basically does a lot of tidying up behind the scenes
[11:39:26] <kolix> anyone know of anything similar to http://wowslider.com/index.html ?
[11:40:02] <pachet> Chopps: and of course, that's if you havent passed any arguments to .clone(), meaning that the behavior is more similar, but not identical to by any means, cloneNode
[11:41:04] <Chopps> ok, pachet, thanks for the explanation :D
[11:41:19] <GAEfan> Sorry for the noob question.  I am trying to detect a keydown when a div is hovered over: http://dpaste.org/x6sOE/
[11:43:48] <pachet> draginx: why would it
[11:43:59] <pachet> it hasnt been attached yet, and you call it instantly
[11:44:00] <draginx> shouldnt it trigger?
[11:44:04] <draginx> ah i see
[11:44:07] <draginx> so if i called it before
[11:44:09] <draginx> it would be ok?
[11:44:36] <pachet> im not sure what you mean
[11:44:50] <pachet> if you want to be able to trigger that callback, make sure you've attached it first
[11:44:53] <pachet> :[
[11:54:22] <`ph8> hi all, i'm wondering if there's an easy way to reverse the order of all the elements inside a div, any ideas?
[11:54:55] <`ph8> so i have rows of 4 squares, 4 squares, 2 squares, and i want it to be 2 squares, 4 squares, 4 squares - it has to be an exact mirror because each square has on-hover metadata associated with it
[11:56:16] <SupaLoused> Hey, Hi.
[11:57:46] <SupaLoused> Im just starting to learn jquey and web desing in general, could someone help me to figure out what things should i understand to put in practice something like this http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/37797.html
[11:58:02] <pachet> `ph8 : var $parent = $('#parent'); $('.square', $parent).each(function(){$parent.prepend(this);});
[11:58:13] <SupaLoused> Also excuse my poor english
[11:58:30] <`ph8> nice, thanks pachet
[12:06:48] <GAEfan> Hi.  Can someone please explain why this does not detect a keydown?  http://dpaste.org/3wNT6/
[12:07:41] <pachet> `ph8: actually, this is sleeker:
[12:07:45] <pachet> var $parent = $('#parent'); $parent.html($('.square', $parent).get().reverse());
[12:07:59] <`ph8> nice
[12:08:10] <pachet> might be a couple gotchas in old IE versions or something, not sure
[12:08:19] <pachet> works in FF just fine though :[
[12:10:28] <raffe> what's a popular and free jquery lightbox library?  slimbox?
[12:11:55] <pachet> people still use lightbox? i thought that was dead
[12:12:01] <pachet> or at least being handed its hat
[12:12:06] <pachet> to misquote contact
[12:12:18] <systemfault> lightbox became a generic term...
[12:12:43] <pachet> yeah i know, i was referring to the generic type of plugin
[12:13:51] <raffe> pachet: i have kind of noticed that, but for my site, i can't come up w/ a good alternative
[12:17:45] <`ph8> hmm having a few problems with that pachet
[12:17:56] <`ph8> i use jquery to populate #square-set-1-container (div) with divs of class square
[12:17:58] <`ph8> then use:
[12:18:02] <`ph8> var $parent = $('#square-set-1-container');
[12:18:02] <`ph8> 		$parent.html($('.square', $parent).get().reverse());
[12:18:07] <`ph8> but it doesn't appear to reverse them
[12:18:13] <`ph8> oh wait
[12:18:16] <`ph8> of course it's reversing them
[12:18:18] <`ph8> but the css float's still apply
[12:18:20] <`ph8> gah
[12:18:47] <`ph8> i want the squares to 'pile up' so it's 2/4/4 rows rather than 4/4/2 as it currently is, so bottom to top rather than top to bottom, any ideas?
[12:19:09] <pachet> move around a div with a 'clear:both;' instruction
[12:21:00] <pachet> granted, there are other ways of doing it
[12:21:08] <pachet> adding a class to designated .square, etc
[12:21:28] <`ph8> looks like i'm going to have to do it with logic ;)
[12:21:55] <pachet> but if you do use a separate div, you'd be able to get away with only using one only if your parent div was wide enough to allow a row of 4 squares max
[12:22:01] <pachet> otherwise you'll need 2
[12:22:19] <pachet> similarly, 2 style changes to squares if you don't
[12:22:37] <pachet> s/don't/don't use a separate element but just modify styles instead
[12:24:41] <SupaLoused> Hello, could someone please tell me what kind of jquery tuto should i check to recreate something like this effect http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/37797.html

[12:32:49] <`ph8> nice
[12:32:59] <`ph8> thanks!

[12:47:23] <QueueQueue> @GAEfan you're binding a keydown event to a span?
[12:47:39] <GAEfan> QueueQueue: Yes, trying
[12:48:17] <SupaLoused> Hey, guys, could somebody help me? I need to know what tuto could help me to understand and recreate an effect like this http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/37797.html
[12:48:56] <SupaLoused> or for what jquery topic should i search
[12:50:03] <QueueQueue> @GAEfan  hmm, how are you giving focus?
[12:50:34] <GAEfan> It is via the hover method.  I do not think focus is needed.  ?
[12:51:24] <GAEfan> QueueQueue: $(this) is the proper span.  However, I cannot bind the key press to it
[12:51:41] <GAEfan> I can only bind the keepers to the doc
[12:52:51] <Dr-Bombay> supaloused: it looks like they're using the elastic effect in jQuery Easing

[12:55:47] <cwd1> Hello. I'm trying to do a setSelectionRange on an element. If I do a getElementById, what's returned works fine. Doing $('#thingie').setSelectionRange(1, 3) doesn't work -- says not a function. How is this done?
[12:57:57] <Dr-Bombay> document.getElementById('thingie').setSelectionRange(1,3)
[12:58:37] <Dr-Bombay> there's no setSelectionRange in jquery
[12:58:49] <Dr-Bombay> it's probably not portable
[12:59:06] <gnarf> Dr-Bombay: jQuery objects are not DOM nodes
[12:59:15] <gnarf> and also, setSelectionRange is not cross browser
[12:59:22] <Dr-Bombay> gnarf: why are you telling me

[13:00:37] <SupaLoused> Awesome @Dr-Bombay
[13:00:47] <SupaLoused> thank you very much
[13:02:55] <cwd1> @gnarf: I know that jQuery objects are not DOM nodes. If I could just pry the DOM node out, I'd be fine. I've read the SO page you've referred to, but I figured grabbing the node itself would be much easier. Eh?

[13:05:15] <gnarf> mythril: it would probably be easier to show

[13:07:13] <mythril> gnarf: and I don't have a handy example, I might be able to cook one up in a second though
[13:07:32] <gnarf> mythril: thanks
[13:07:57] <friedbyte> is there a selector to find first child of a parent?
[13:09:18] <pachet> $('#parent :first-child')
[13:09:25] <anew_> anyone have an easy method to find what function in the jq file is being used on a div ?
[13:09:47] <gnarf> P.S. 1.8b1 is up
[13:09:52] <gnarf> http://bit.ly/jquery18b1
[13:09:53] <pachet> gnarf: famous last words
[13:09:58] <pachet> "you get th---"
[13:11:45] <lmg> good evening #jquery
[13:12:41] <anew_> anyone have an easy method to find what function in the jq file is being used on a div ?
[13:13:50] <pachet> anew_ firebug script tools, you can step through the evaluation
[13:13:57] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[13:14:06] <ProLoser|Work> i need some feedback from some experienced plugin developers
[13:14:14] <ProLoser|Work> https://github.com/ProLoser/Rotary-Datepicker
[13:14:27] <ProLoser|Work> i want to make things like opts and references to $this available globally amongst all functions
[13:14:38] <ProLoser|Work> i'm not sure of the best way to structure my plugin to accomplish this
[13:14:50] <ProLoser|Work> on what object should i store all of these things on?
[13:15:06] <anew_> pachet same thing as stepping thru in chrome right ?
[13:15:41] <pachet> yeah
[13:16:08] <lmg> not exactly sure, if the troubles I'm having are even jQuery related, but this is my first time using it..
[13:16:13] <pachet> ProLoser|Work: store them in a variable within the larger IIFE
[13:16:43] <lmg> I'm replacing some imgages' src attr.
[13:16:55] <pachet> ProLoser|Work: oh you do, my b
[13:16:58] <pachet> got ahead of myself
[13:16:59] <anew_> pachet ok, any idea why timeline never shows functions? always comes up with jquery-1.7.1.min.js etc
[13:17:01] <lmg> but the very first time I change it.. the other image goes white.
[13:17:16] <lmg> no freakin' idea why, no error whatsoever in firebug. O_o
[13:17:51] <lmg> someone feel like lending me a hand debugging?
[13:18:03] <rodd> lmg: got a fiddle?
[13:18:34] <lmg> that a pastebin?
[13:18:52] <lmg> nah, page source is 64 lines. don't think I need to paste that.
[13:18:58] <lmg> :)
[13:19:10] <rodd> http://jsfiddle.net
[13:19:11] <lmg> care to look rodd? -> http://kishalmi.net/tmp/yoke_colors/
[13:20:07] <lmg> I don't get it.
[13:20:19] <lmg> once you clicked both.. it just works.
[13:20:41] <lmg> but the first click makes the other image (part) invisible/white/dunno.
[13:21:02] <mythril> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/Ta2Qz/ <- notice I define a listener inside of the plugin, I want to be able to find a way to ensure I'm the last listener that gets fired _or_ fire a callback after all the handlers have been fired
[13:21:05] <lmg> in case you wonder: no errors in the colorizing php, that's fine. I'm watching the log.
[13:21:48] <gnarf> mythril: would a simple setTimeout( fn, 0 ) help?
[13:21:52] <gnarf> to run in the "next frame" ?
[13:22:55] <mythril> gnarf: it would work, but it's sorta hacky and I would like to be able to find out if the event's "default" behavior was prevented (meaning the behavior I specify in the plugin)
[13:23:12] <lmg> any ideas rodd? (and who else is checking)
[13:23:26] <pachet> window.requestAnimationFrame(fn); /*next frame :[  */
[13:24:12] <lmg> this is so dead simple, one might think it should just_work
[13:24:41] <gnarf> mythril: Dave might have an idea here... I'm not sure if there is anything built in for that
[13:24:56] <gnarf> but i think the special events might let you basically define the "default"
[13:24:57] <rodd> lmg: you're getting a 'blank' result because of both images
[13:25:09] <mythril> gnarf: special events?
[13:25:16] <gnarf> asking DaveMethvin to take a look at it
[13:25:19] <lmg> rodd: sorry, I'm not following.
[13:25:29] <gnarf> mythril: jQuery has a custom event bindings thing
[13:25:48] <rodd> if you check on firebug, once you change part 1, both images have the same shape
[13:25:50] <gnarf> mythril: were you can make up event names and give them some properties, or setup how the get triggered
[13:26:22] <rodd> lmg: guess you should update both image sources
[13:26:41] <mythril> gnarf: is there a place I can find a run down of how to set that up?

[13:26:52] <gnarf> ?g jQuery special events
[13:26:52] <caniuse> gnarf: Ben Alman » jQuery special events - http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/jquery-special-events/
[13:26:56] <lmg> rodd: how does that explain that it works once you clicked both?
[13:27:17] <lmg> omfg rodd
[13:27:25] <mythril> gnarf: thank you, I will bend my mind in that direction
[13:27:28] <lmg> the 1 has the 2 image default.. and vice versa
[13:27:37] <rodd> lmg: there you go
[13:27:45] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you think special events _default stuff would solve the case mythril is looking to solve?
[13:27:46] <lmg> damn I feel stupid now.
[13:28:04] <lmg> rodd: thank you kindly for taking the time. I owe you one! :)
[13:28:06] <DaveMethvin> gnarf mythril to run last?
[13:28:14] <rodd> lmg: no problem :)
[13:28:26] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, like bind some action to the "default" action
[13:28:28] <lmg> have a great evening #jquery
[13:28:33] <lmg> rodd++
[13:28:33] <gnarf> so it can be prevented by handlers bound before it
[13:29:18] <DaveMethvin> is this for a custom event, or is it instead a native event fired by the browser?
[13:30:50] <user> hi
[13:33:29] <gnarf> mythril: did you see DaveMethvin's question? :)
[13:33:41] <gnarf> he's by far the event expert around here ;)
[13:33:49] <DaveMethvin> mythril: s this for a custom event, or is it instead a native event fired by the browser?
[13:37:27] <dustybrains> a
[13:43:10] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[13:43:19] <ProLoser|Work> any experienced plugin devs around?
[13:44:40] <Dr-Bombay> don't ask "any"
[13:46:13] <ProLoser|Work> what is the best way to store stuff globally for reference in all my fn's here: https://github.com/ProLoser/Rotary-Datepicker
[13:51:20] <faraway> ProLoser|Work: using the closure capability of javascript  and defining a "var" for the storage within your "(function($){" block ?
[13:54:04] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: what faraway said -- private variable in your plugins closure
[13:55:05] <mythril> gnarf, DaveMethvin: sorry I was at lunch, it's for a custom event
[13:55:30] <mythril> damn, looks like I was too late to catch Dave
[13:56:14] <ProLoser|Work> faraway: but it shouldn't share data across instances of the plugin, should it?
[13:57:50] <faraway> ProLoser|Work: this would share between all instances of the plugin
[13:58:33] <ProLoser|Work> so what if each instance has different options?
[13:58:43] <ProLoser|Work> or i suppose they wouldn't if they were all instantiated with the same call :/
[13:59:09] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: then you use a data object stored on the element the plugin is called on
[13:59:13] <faraway> ProLoser|Work: then you should have said globally ;)
[13:59:22] <faraway> shouldn't
[13:59:40] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: UI Widget Factory actually handles a lot of that for you
[13:59:43] <faraway> damn i can writ anymore
[14:00:11] <ProLoser|Work> gnarf: but it creates a dependency on jq-ui
[14:00:14] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: but you can do it yourself by just storing an object that is like an "instance" of your plugin
[14:00:19] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: only on widget factory
[14:00:24] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: widget factory stands alone
[14:00:32] <ProLoser|Work> do people actually use it?
[14:00:37] <ProLoser|Work> i have thought about leveraging it
[14:00:40] <ProLoser|Work> but i don't see anyone who does
[14:00:44] <gnarf> It does a lot of useful things
[14:00:50] <ProLoser|Work> or do i just bundle it into my plugin?
[14:00:54] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: other than the UI team, I only know of a few externals
[14:01:17] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: but widget factory is very useful
[14:01:44] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: I would bundle a copy of it alongside if you decided to use it, but realistically you should just tell them to go download the newest one anyway
[14:01:56] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work:  you might want to develop on top of the 1.9 widget factory too
[14:02:31] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: lots of good stuff got added to it in 1.9
[14:02:36] <ProLoser|Work> but if no one else uses it should i really bother to?
[14:03:03] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: If it saves you time, use it. Otherwise read over it and decide what you think is useful.
[14:03:27] <gnarf> but the widget bridge, stateful options, defaults, etc are all things you're gonna have to hand code without it
[14:04:09] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js
[14:09:36] <miceiken> is input:text:last valid?
[14:10:12] <miceiken> as a selector
[14:10:14] <zamn> hey currently i have this form set so that when a button is clicked an ajax action happens. Now i want to override the enter keypress to do that same thing. How would I acheive this?
[14:10:36] <zamn> I've tried $("#textboxID").keypress(function (e) { }} already
[14:10:44] <zamn> and the form still seems to be submtiting
[14:10:58] <NoiseEee> stop the submit event of your form, zam
[14:11:00] <NoiseEee> zamn
[14:11:04] <zamn> how can i do that?
[14:11:47] <NoiseEee> $('#formID').on('submit',function(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); });
[14:12:01] <zamn> ah okay
[14:12:37] <gnarf> miceiken: yes as a jQuery selector, but not CSS, I would suggest jQuery("input[type='text']").last() instead (assuming you actually have type=text attributes
[14:12:44] <gnarf> otherwise :text i suppose works
[14:13:04] <zamn> thanks NoiseEee
[14:13:10] <NoiseEee> np zamn
[14:13:17] <gnarf> my suggestion can actually use native querySelector implementations rather than having to be parsed by sizzle
[14:19:11] <miceiken> gnarf, doesnt seem to work though
[14:19:47] <gnarf> If my friend bot-t were here, he'd tell you how little "doesn't seem to work" means to me
[14:19:55] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[14:20:00] <primeras> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/06/22/jquery-1-8-beta-1-see-whats-coming-and-going/
[14:20:38] <MistuhKurtz> your elements do have type attributes right miceiken
[14:20:41] <miceiken> $("input[type='text']").last() this gnarf
[14:20:42] <miceiken> yeah MissionCritical
[14:20:44] <miceiken> MistuhKurtz*
[14:21:07] <MistuhKurtz> does text need single quotes around it?
[14:21:10] <MistuhKurtz> try without
[14:21:46] <miceiken> ah that worked MistuhKurtz
[14:24:08] <MistuhKurtz> Cool good miceiken
[14:44:43] <mnewton> Hey guys, I'm trying to get some json from http://statics.site50.net/init.json?callback=? and it has valid json, but $.getJSON('http://statics.site50.net/init.json?callback=?', function(data) {alert(data);}); fails with Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[14:44:58] <mnewton> what's wrong?
[14:45:51] <mnewton> is jsonp formatted differently than json
[14:45:59] <mnewton> and how do i format it?
[14:46:51] <gnarf> ?g JSONP
[14:46:52] <caniuse> gnarf: JSONP - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[14:46:55] <systemfault> mnewton: JSONP is a javascript function call
[14:47:24] <gnarf> mnewton: callback=jQuery123123... Result:   jQuery123123( jsondata )
[14:47:58] <gnarf> mnewton: effectively, you are calling a function with your json data
[14:49:27] <mnewton> gnarf, so i should take my json and surround it with ()
[14:49:35] <johnkpaul> caniuse: you can google now?
[14:49:38] <gnarf> mnewton: no, you need the callback function too
[14:49:48] <gnarf> mnewton: read about the protocol on wikipedia man
[14:49:52] <gnarf> its pretty straight forward
[14:49:58] <johnkpaul> ?g what is jsonp remy sharp @ mnewton
[14:49:59] <caniuse> mnewton: What is JSONP? - remy sharp's b:log - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[14:50:42] <johnkpaul> that has a little more detail, mnewton
[14:50:46] <johnkpaul> also, hey gnarf
[14:51:34] <gnarf> sup johnkpaul
[14:58:23] <MistuhKurtz> mnewton, JSONP embeds a <script> element that executes javascript, which injects JSON data. jQuery's abstraction makes it just as easy as JSON pretty much
[14:59:35] <mnewton> gnarf, johnkpaul , MistuhKurtz thanks =]
[15:00:28] <MistuhKurtz> mnewton, if you have a JSON feed that you wish to consume as JSONP then you can use this JSON proxy hosted on Heroku: https://github.com/maxogden/jsonpify
[15:02:46] <ProLoser|Work> what is the best way to capture [esc] key presses?
[15:02:50] <ProLoser|Work> so as to close my widget?
[15:04:20] <mnewton> ProLoser|Work, are you using jquery?
[15:04:51] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: bind a handler to document that receives a keyup
[15:05:03] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/mask/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L715-722
[15:05:24] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: although that situation is a little more complex
[15:05:28] <gnarf> than yours will be
[15:05:44] <mnewton> ProLoser|Work, http://pastebin.com/JDHrAVVJ
[15:05:55] <gnarf> you can just this._on( this.document, { "keyup": fn } );
[15:06:09] <gnarf> where fn will check for escape, and not prevented and call close on your widget
[15:07:01] <devmikey> Question: Why does this work: workbench.tmmarket.com/mike/SeacorTable/newseacortable.html
[15:07:03] <ProLoser|Work> i shouldn't rely on this, should ? $.ui.keyCode.ESCAPE
[15:07:28] <devmikey> But this not: http://www.seacorholdings.com/pages/equipment_register
[15:08:03] <mnewton> var code = e.keyCode || e.which;
[15:08:03] <mnewton> 	if(code === 27) {
[15:08:11] <mnewton> 27 === escape
[15:08:19] <devmikey> The table is supposed to populate with date fetched using jquery
[15:08:25] <devmikey> data*
[15:13:31] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: === 27
[15:14:03] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: the .ui.keyCode is stored in ui.core - so it adds another dependancy on top of widget you don't really need
[15:14:14] <gnarf> just try to avoid the magic number ;)
[15:14:16] <gnarf> give it a name
[15:14:53] <miceiken> okay, so I am using replaceWith to make a new html element, but it seems to me like jQuery doesnt recognize it as an element
[15:16:02] <devmikey> gnarf: help!

[15:35:44] <mzarella> shoky: the code was fine
[15:36:28] <MistuhKurtz> aro yes, RGB
[15:36:31] <julieanna> are there situations in which .empty().append('some content') is better than .html('some content'). In other words, does .empty() avoid memory leaks or other things that .html() doesn't handle?
[15:37:18] <TheIronSky> Why do you ask?
[15:38:08] <julieanna> TheIronSky: because .html() is shorter, but .empty().append() might have benefits i'm not aware of
[15:38:16] <shoky> mzarella: k
[15:40:15] <shoky> julieanna: .html cleans the element
[15:40:49] <shoky> julieanna: no need for .empty()

[15:46:07] <Jake232> If i have this code, to alert me when any inputs change, and then dynamically add inputs, how can I make it so they also trigger the event?

[15:48:41] <amites> Any pointers why I keep getting error "Cannot call method 'match' of undefined" ???  http://jsfiddle.net/sHuYn/
[15:49:34] <fraxture> hi all, i've got a question about namespacing. i'm working with some code that came like this: http://pastebin.com/kZXAxSux. it contains some code that runs right away when the script is loaded, but i want to encapsualte some of that code within a function that i can call from $(document).ready. i'm at a bit of a loss about how to begin however...
[15:49:42] <shoky> amites: you forgot .parent()
[15:49:51] <fraxture> if anyone can give me some tips that would be great.
[15:50:08] <Whirl3d_> amites, your $(this) is the img, $(this).attr("id") don't work
[15:50:44] <Whirl3d_> shoky! wasssuuup?
[15:50:45] <amites> shoky, Whirl3d_ : thank you -- figured it was something obvious
[15:51:04] <shoky> amites also i don't think you want to set the value of anything to the returned array from match()
[15:51:22] <shoky> aightt sups Whirl3d_
[15:51:34] <Whirl3d_> amites, you could handle all that better delegating your click events to the parent using .on
[15:51:34] <amites> fraxture: good place to start is pasting your code into jsfiddle -- might answer your own question as you assemble it in a way that's easy for others to debug
[15:52:46] <fraxture> amites, will do...
[15:52:51] <amites> Whirl3d_: perhaps -- trying to keep it a bit more backwards compatible -- the <li> objects are already being generated from JSON
[15:52:52] <shoky> Whirl3d_: you just cache it into some var ,  like var plugin
[15:53:24] <shoky> or var self, or var context, or var instance, or whutever
[15:55:05] <shoky> and deciding between plugin name or plugin.prototype .. depends on what you're doing i guess
[15:55:17] <shoky> plugin.prototype is for non-instance methods
[15:57:07] <shoky> fraxture: that code is already in a DOM ready handler
[15:57:19] <shoky> $(function() { ... });
[15:58:15] <shoky> and if you don't want some code to run, you put it in a named function that you reference/call whenever you want to
[16:00:18] <Whirl3d_> amites, the markup doesn't have to change: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/sHuYn/4/
[16:00:41] <fraxture> shoky, ahhh ok.  so if $(function() { ...}); is a DOM ready handler, what is the (function() ... ) (); part?
[16:01:36] <Whirl3d_> the nice part about delegating in this case is that you could have multiple collections of images that you could add (using json) without having to constant reassign click handlers
[16:01:50] <Whirl3d_> it makes it backwards compatible and futureproof
[16:02:12] <shoky> fraxture:  ( function() { ... } )   <-- thats just an anonymous function , the parentheses around it dont really do anything.
[16:02:43] <shoky> fraxture:  ( function() { ... } )();   <--- adding the ()  actually calls that anonymous function. usually called an IIFE - immediately invoked function expressions
[16:02:44] <shoky> -s
[16:03:19] <shoky> i really hate it when people call it a self-executing anonymous function :\
[16:05:16] <shoky> fraxture: and as the comment there says, the purpose of wrapping some code in an IIFE, is to give a private scope for the variables/functions inside, so you don't pollute the global/current context
[16:05:18] <fraxture> shoky, ok this is super helpful.  i just found that syntax totally unclear.
[16:07:03] <shoky> so i guess what you're looking to do is to take that IIFE , turn it into just a regular function  (i.e. remove wrapping parens and the () at the end, and giving it a name), and calling it when you want to
[16:10:22] <fraxture> shoky, what i want to do is isolate some of the code that is in there that basically initializes a slider so that i can call it after some other stuff has happened on page load. the problem is that the init code is running too early.
[16:10:32] <fraxture> i think you've given me the inof i needed though
[16:10:43] <fraxture> thanks!

[16:18:07] <RohanBhangui> shoky you there?
[16:18:13] <shoky> Jake232 one way is  $('.test').filter(function() { return $(this).closest('div.notme').length == 0 })

[16:18:30] <RohanBhangui> do you have my fiddle?
[16:18:35] <shoky> no
[16:18:37] <Dave_Stein> I can get either to happen if i try hard enough, but it would be nice to not try so hard. :)
[16:18:50] <RohanBhangui> okay do oyu want me to resend link to you
[16:19:11] <shoky> if you want me to look at it, that'll be necessary
[16:19:23] <shoky> (PM isn't necessary)
[16:28:26] <dunkel2> hello
[16:28:42] <dunkel2> if i need to set a function in the on event, with some argument what should i do?
[16:29:12] <dunkel2> becaus eif i set like selector.on('click', myfunction(arg)); it is triggered in that instant
[16:29:30] <Whirl3d_> pre 1.7, what was the best way to handle delegated events?
[16:30:11] <dunkel2> do i have to use an event handler? and send my argument as a dara?
[16:30:14] <dunkel2> data
[16:30:48] <dunkel2> or an anonymus function and inside that function the call to my method with the argument?
[16:31:33] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/65fq4/1/
[16:31:43] <RohanBhangui> shoky there^
[16:36:39] <fraxture> shoky, you still there?
[16:40:51] <fraxture> shoky, here's the code on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/K4asG/. i've encapsulated some of the code in my slider code in an init function, but i'm unable to call that function from a doc ready jquery function in a <script> tag in the head of the document. my goal here is just to make sure that the slider does not initialize until the images that are part of the slider have been added to the document.
[16:43:10] <shadykhan> how can i make an if then statement stating one onclick the box expands on the second click it goes back to normal?
[16:43:42] <Whirl3d_> ? toggle
[16:44:22] <shadykhan> yea
[16:44:35] <Whirl3d_> sorry, bot-t is on vaca it looks like. lookup the toggle method for jquery in the api...probably api.jquery.com/toggle or similar
[16:45:03] <Whirl3d_> ?.toggle
[16:45:09] <shadykhan> yeah i just grabbed it
[16:45:18] <Whirl3d_> usually, bot-t chimes in with a link.
[16:45:21] <shadykhan> but i just used hide show as an example would i be able to use toggle for animation
[16:45:33] <shadykhan> the object is essentially moving right and if i keep clicking it it will keep going right
[16:46:09] <Whirl3d_> yes there's the toggle method and the toggleClass animation method...
[16:46:25] <Whirl3d_> so you don't want to toggle on click,
[16:46:33] <Whirl3d_> you want it to continue to go right on click
[16:46:38] <Whirl3d_> ?
[16:46:39] <cohitre> shadykhan: the toggle method receives two or more handlers
[16:46:48] <cohitre> it will iterate through the handles on each click.
[16:46:55] <cohitre> so you can create one for open and one for close
[16:47:15] <shadykhan> ahh thank you cohitre & Whirl3d_
[16:47:35] <cohitre> shadykhan: http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[16:57:11] <Whirl3d_> are there any cute ways to avoid having to write this in every single function?   function (item) { if (item && item.length) {       or:   if (!item||!item.length) { return false;}
[16:59:27] <Dr-Bombay> write a nullOrEmpty function to do it. Doesn't seem like much of an improvement though
[17:01:44] <cohitre> pass an empty array when you are calling the function so you don't have to handle the special case when item is undefined. (item || [])
[17:01:48] <Whirl3d_> I wrote a stupid exists function that is totally unnecessary, but makes it easier to read...I'll find/replace when I compress...but I thought I saw once where someone use a statement like   var item || return;    It was as though they managed to force a return as part of the "or" comparison sr something..
[17:05:03] <cohitre> you can also write a tryCall function
[17:05:15] <cohitre> tryCall(item, "length")
[17:05:58] <RohanBhangui> shoky your still there right?
[17:06:23] <Whirl3d_> cohitre, Dr.Bombay, thanks for the feedback. I think I'll just tough it out with if (!exists(item)) return;   LOL
[17:06:24] <someprimetime> i want to replace a word with some surrounding html, but it's not wrapping the <span class="admin_styles_type"></span> around the text... http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/fmu5m/3/ : like typing in `class` should show <span class="admin_styles_type">class</span> but it'll just output class
[17:08:36] <Whirl3d_> ?   someprimetime.....give me two line response:    input:   (send)   expected output: (send)
[17:08:45] <Whirl3d_> apples
[17:08:54] <Whirl3d_> <something>aplles<?something>
[17:08:59] <Whirl3d_> for example...
[17:10:18] <Whirl3d_> I don't understand what you want for input and what you expect for output..   simply input=_____________   output=_____________ and it willhelp me understand better lol..
[17:12:43] <shoky> RohanBhangui yes
[17:12:50] <RohanBhangui> okay
[17:13:05] <RohanBhangui> just amking sure you were still there thought you were afk
[17:13:10] <shoky> i was
[17:13:39] <RohanBhangui> oh
[17:13:46] <RohanBhangui> you got my link rihgt?
[17:13:49] <shoky> ye
[17:14:41] <someprimetime> yo Whirl3d_ sorry was afk
[17:14:47] <someprimetime> basically i want to input `class`
[17:14:48] <someprimetime> and output
[17:14:57] <someprimetime> `<span class="admin_styles_tag">class</span>`
[17:15:01] <shoky> rohan but i don't understand what you want
[17:15:03] <someprimetime> but it's just outputting `class`
[17:15:07] <RohanBhangui> okay
[17:15:09] <someprimetime> not wrapping it with that span class
[17:15:09] <RohanBhangui> shoky
[17:15:17] <RohanBhangui> you see where a.clcik
[17:15:19] <RohanBhangui> is?
[17:15:21] <shoky> ye
[17:15:28] <RohanBhangui> i want to take that whole clcick function
[17:15:39] <RohanBhangui> and make a gneral funciton out of that
[17:15:46] <RohanBhangui> so that i can use it anywhere in my code
[17:15:48] <RohanBhangui> such that
[17:15:53] <shoky> ok so you just need to give it a name
[17:15:53] <RohanBhangui> i can go something like this
[17:16:03] <RohanBhangui> click function (somehting)
[17:16:30] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/65fq4/2/ ?
[17:16:32] <RohanBhangui> where click function is the function that executes all the code i have written (the cos sin stuff)
[17:16:53] <shoky> ok i called it clickHandler ..
[17:16:57] <RohanBhangui> and somehting is the target
[17:17:04] <RohanBhangui> that i want the clcik function to act upon
[17:17:08] <RohanBhangui> yes that is the link
[17:17:44] <shoky> you mean to replace 'targets' ?
[17:18:12] <RohanBhangui> yes
[17:18:25] <RohanBhangui> the variable targets should be the children of the click event
[17:18:30] <RohanBhangui> event's target
[17:18:37] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/65fq4/3/ ?
[17:18:39] <RohanBhangui> in other words the a.clcik 's children
[17:18:54] <shoky> you're not making much sense, i'm just guessing wildly
[17:19:25] <RohanBhangui> okay you got that part
[17:19:49] <RohanBhangui> now the targets instead of a variable that is "pointing to certain children
[17:19:58] <RohanBhangui> shoudl point to the children of the a.clcik
[17:20:05] <shoky> no idea what you mean
[17:20:42] <shoky> try to read what you're saying
[17:20:47] <RohanBhangui> okay
[17:20:47] <shoky> i wonder if you understand it yourself
[17:20:54] <RohanBhangui> let me get my thoughts together
[17:21:01] <shoky> "now the targets instead of a variable that is "pointing to certain children "
[17:21:02] <shoky> ???
[17:21:23] <RohanBhangui> var targets = (a.click's children)
[17:21:32] <shoky> a.click is a selector
[17:21:41] <shoky> for an <a> element
[17:21:44] <shoky> that doesnt have any children
[17:21:49] <shoky> so wtf do you mean
[17:21:54] <RohanBhangui> it has children
[17:21:59] <RohanBhangui> contact, pages, etc
[17:22:03] <shoky> <a class="click" href="#">Rohan</a>
[17:22:07] <shoky> no children
[17:22:12] <shoky> (just text)
[17:22:29] <RohanBhangui> but if you see just before that line
[17:22:37] <RohanBhangui> there is "li class =show
[17:22:40] <shoky> yep
[17:22:56] <RohanBhangui> which wraps the childreni mentioned
[17:23:04] <shoky> so they are the <li>'s children
[17:23:07] <shoky> not "a.click"
[17:23:30] <shoky> go to notepad. write complete sentences. go over them 20 times until you are sure they are fully understandable and make sense
[17:23:37] <shoky> then paste that here.
[17:23:41] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:23:43] <RohanBhangui> okay
[17:23:45] <shoky> otherwise you are wasting yours and my time
[17:23:53] <Whirl3d_> someprimetime, you don't mean like this do you: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/fmu5m/8/
[17:24:18] <someprimetime> ah shoot i knew i should have concatenated those
[17:24:19] <someprimetime> thanks Whirl3d_
[17:24:21] <someprimetime> :)
[17:25:24] <RohanBhangui> sry shoky
[17:25:32] <RohanBhangui> let me ask you individual questions
[17:25:40] <RohanBhangui> as oppose to the full puzzle
[17:25:48] <Draxel> jQuery(".dropdown-menu").slimScroll(  <- does this line mean that it has to look at css for .dropdown-menu property?
[17:26:06] <RohanBhangui> how can i check whether an li element has children
[17:26:23] <shoky> $('li').children().length > 0
[17:26:36] <shoky> or .contents().length
[17:26:50] <Draxel> shoky, could please answer my question?:)
[17:27:08] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:27:09] <shoky> Draxel: im not sure what your q is
[17:27:25] <shoky> Draxel: what is "it" and what does "look at css" mean
[17:27:43] <Draxel> ok, let me explain
[17:27:50] <RohanBhangui> shoky can you use .header instead of li?
[17:28:02] <shoky> RohanBhangui: you can use SDLGJSDOKLGJSDKL instead of KDSJGKSDJGKSD also
[17:28:11] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:28:15] <RohanBhangui> stupid question
[17:28:16] <RohanBhangui> thx
[17:28:19] <shoky> ;p
[17:29:10] <teear> jqueery
[17:30:37] <Draxel> shoky: there's jquery dropdown menu on my site. and it is used in widget section and post area. Currently, if i try to change style of dropdown in widget section, the appearance changes of dropdown which is in post area. I want them to have separate styles. I'm trying to find part where jquery calls style property. :/
[17:30:58] <shoky> whaat ;)
[17:31:10] <citronbleu-v> hi
[17:31:11] <Draxel> :D
[17:31:49] <shoky> Draxel:   jQuery(".dropdown-menu")  <-  queries the DOM for elements with dropdown-menu class
[17:31:50] <Draxel> shoky, 2 jquery menus, both use the same style. I want them to have different styles
[17:32:22] <Draxel> how to make 2 styles?
[17:32:36] <shoky> style1 { ... }   style2 { ... }    ?
[17:32:57] <Draxel> ye, but it calls jquery(".dropdown-menu") just once
[17:33:06] <shoky> it?
[17:33:09] <Draxel> :D
[17:33:46] <shoky> if it calls it once, it will query the DOM once. still no idea what you're asking
[17:34:21] <Draxel> I dont undestand too lol
[17:34:31] <citronbleu-v> Is it a bad practice to remove html code with html method ? if there are of events or objet associate ?
[17:35:08] <RohanBhangui> shoky: and does .children target the direct children?
[17:35:30] <shoky> Draxel, maybe you mean:   HTML: <div id="menu1" class="dropdown-menu"></div>   <div id="menu2" class="dropdown-menu"></div>     CSS:  .dropdown-menu { ... }   #menu1 { ... }   #menu2 { .... }
[17:35:32] <shoky> i donno.
[17:35:42] <shoky> RohanBhangui: yepp
[17:36:25] <Draxel> shoky, I'm checking it again
[17:37:07] <RohanBhangui> so if i have li element which has a sub point which has a subpoint it will only target the second subpoint?
[17:37:18] <shoky> subpoint?
[17:37:21] <RohanBhangui> *first subpoint
[17:37:23] <RohanBhangui> like
[17:37:45] <shoky> and, what is "it" ?
[17:38:26] <RohanBhangui> http://pastebin.me/9cb729b698f5239e99aac66dd5040e5b
[17:38:31] <citronbleu-v> <div id="toto"><div class="remove-this-element"><button class="event-with-jquery"></div></div> << the event in .event-with-jquery will be automaticaly removed if I remove $('#toto').remove($('#toto .remove-this-element')); or $('#toto').html($('#toto .remove-this-element')); ?
[17:39:07] <shoky> RohanBhangui: HTML would be much clearer
[17:39:50] <shoky> RohanBhangui: anyway, so subpoint1 is a direct child of list item, and subpoint1.1 is NOT a direct child of list item.. what are you asking?
[17:40:02] <RohanBhangui> yes
[17:40:13] <shoky> RohanBhangui: and why do you need to ask anyway. try it and see
[17:40:18] <RohanBhangui> true
[17:41:37] <shoky> citronbleu-v: first of all your html is bad
[17:42:03] <shoky> citronbleu-v: 2nd, what your .remove() call is bad
[17:42:34] <shoky> citronbleu-v: 3rd, your .html() call is, also, bad
[17:42:49] <shoky> citronbleu-v: point to take home: RTFM
[17:43:26] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/65fq4/7/
[17:43:31] <RohanBhangui> whats wrong with the following
[17:44:24] <shoky> RohanBhangui: the page loads fine, so, not that.
[17:44:30] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:44:33] <RohanBhangui> thats not it
[17:44:39] <RohanBhangui> look at the first few js lines
[17:44:43] <shoky> ok ok . the gray background is kinda boring
[17:44:43] <RohanBhangui> there is something wrong there
[17:44:53] <RohanBhangui> i know fo rnow you will have ot bear with it
[17:45:08] <citronbleu-v> and for $('#toto .element').data('tutu', new MyObject()); and if I do $('#toto').html('');. Is the memory still contains the objects ?
[17:45:09] <RohanBhangui> next time ill make it pink okay?
[17:45:16] <shoky>  ($('.header').children()).hide();  is a bit funny ..
[17:45:22] <shoky> why the extra parens
[17:45:29] <someprimetime> does $.each() have a callback that I can run when it's finishing looping through all dom elements?
[17:45:30] <shoky> $('.header').children().hide();
[17:45:48] <someprimetime> or do I have to do if (value == obj.length - 1)?
[17:45:54] <shoky> someprimetime:  $.each(....);  i_am_done();
[17:46:09] <shoky> your q doesn't make sense
[17:46:29] <someprimetime> yeah nm
[17:46:30] <RohanBhangui> still doesnt show
[17:46:30] <shoky> each() is not an asynchronous call
[17:46:37] <someprimetime> i'll just throw this after then thx
[17:47:21] <shoky> RohanBhangui: you're not supposed to ask what's wrong, you're supposed to SAY what's wrong. and ask why.
[17:48:06] <RohanBhangui> my links are not showing after i put the if statement at the top of my js file
[17:48:36] <shoky> do you want them to show
[17:49:32] <RohanBhangui> yes
[17:49:40] <RohanBhangui> and hide there children
[17:49:43] <RohanBhangui> using .hide
[17:49:47] <RohanBhangui> and .children
[17:50:59] <shoky> hide the children of the <li> ?
[17:51:23] <shoky> the links don't have children, remember..
[17:51:34] <RohanBhangui> the first one does though
[17:51:48] <RohanBhangui> hid ethe hildren of .header
[17:53:49] <shoky> could you write, in one sentence, what it is that you want to hide.   for example:  i want to hide all the children of all <li>'s with class 'header'
[17:54:02] <RohanBhangui> i want to hide all the children of all <li>'s with class 'header'
[17:54:07] <shoky> :)
[17:54:08] <RohanBhangui> so used to texting
[17:54:21] <shoky> $('li.header').children().hide();
[17:55:15] <shoky> are you sure that you want to hide all children of all <li>'s with class 'header'?  make sure.
[17:55:43] <shoky> the <a>'s for example, are also children of header <li>'s
[17:56:01] <RohanBhangui> fine:
[17:57:09] <Whirl3d_> shoky! RTFM? love it...lol
[17:57:40] <RohanBhangui> i want to hide all the li children of all <li>'s with class 'header'
[17:57:43] <shoky> l0l
[17:57:58] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:58:45] <shoky> $('li.header > li').hide()
[17:59:06] <shoky> (or $('li.header').children('li').hide()  )
[17:59:38] <licryle> hey there
[17:59:49] <shoky> though i dont think you have and <li> children of <li>
[17:59:55] <shoky> s/and/any
[17:59:59] <RohanBhangui> not yet
[18:00:02] <shoky> /
[18:00:08] <shoky> oK
[18:00:36] <RohanBhangui> problem #2:
[18:00:40] <RohanBhangui> this one is easy
[18:00:43] <RohanBhangui> promise
[18:00:44] <shoky> it'd be weird if you have <li><li></li></li> no?
[18:00:50] <RohanBhangui> yup
[18:00:52] <RohanBhangui> :P
[18:00:53] <shoky> coz an <li> needs to be a child of a list..
[18:00:54] <RohanBhangui> ROFL
[18:00:58] <RohanBhangui> ya
[18:01:00] <RohanBhangui> what happens
[18:01:04] <raj> wutup antishok
[18:01:13] <shoky> okzy raj. sawp
[18:01:19] <RohanBhangui> is when something gets a subpoint it automatically (i will program this later) get the class header
[18:01:31] <raj> nm
[18:01:39] <raj> did you get that link I sent yesterday?
[18:02:45] <shoky> yeah saw it before. but now i completely forgot what it was :P
[18:03:00] <mzarella> how is .done a future?
[18:03:02] <raj> it was for resizing an element when you change its content
[18:03:10] <raj> makes it transition sexily
[18:03:10] <shoky> ahh right
[18:03:23] <shoky> yea looked cute
[18:03:30] <licryle> is anyone using jquery mobile? I have a question on toolbars and I am kind of new to the framework :)
[18:03:44] <shoky> mzarella: what?
[18:04:08] <shoky> mzarella: it registers a callback to be called (maybe) in the future
[18:06:23] <shoky> mzarella: deferreds/promises are like futures
[18:11:44] <shoky> raj, i prefer this tho https://github.com/mattdiamond/fuckitjs
[18:14:27] <melvinram> I'm trying to do $(".task input").change ->    $(this).parents("form:first").submit() in coffeescript but it's not working. You can see the live page at http://3re8.localtunnel.com (login is money@example.com and password is password) . the js is in http://3re8.localtunnel.com/assets/tasks.js?body=1
[18:14:35] <melvinram> Anyone see what's going wrong?
[18:15:54] <melvinram> I know that the file is getting triggered and I even tested with alert that the function bound to the change event is getting triggered. but it won't select the form
[18:16:03] <Whirl3d_> can hasClass take multiple classes in an or union if (elem.hasClass("current, disabled") {dontTouch} ?
[18:17:18] <shoky> nope
[18:17:35] <tw2113> how about an array var?
[18:18:06] <shoky> nope
[18:18:24] <Whirl3d_> .is will work though
[18:18:35] <tw2113> laaaame
[18:18:35] <shoky> yep
[18:19:21] <shoky> why you ungrateful sonofamom
[18:20:54] <Draxel> shoky, couldn't fix this problem. Style is determined in JS.. it's too complicated as I dont understand it. Anyway, found a temporary fix. Thank you for your help
[18:22:53] <melvinram> Draxel: mine is simpler
[18:23:08] <Whirl3d_> triggering an event on an object that does not have a handler bound to that event (and the event isn't a native event), does nothing, right?
[18:27:43] <snuggs> I am not in the right room
[18:28:20] <snuggs> what channel would I be in for "torrents"?
[18:28:20] <melvinram> Whirl3d_: is that comment for me?
[18:29:05] <snuggs> I sincerely apologize for messing this up
[18:29:32] <snuggs> i do love query though
[18:29:39] <snuggs> jQuery!
[18:29:49] <snuggs> my life!
[18:29:52] <Whirl3d_> melvinram, haven't even looked at your issue..
[18:30:37] <snuggs> I can sincerely say that irc is my escape to feeling like I am "at home"
[18:30:58] <snuggs> being in a chat room just feels right
[18:31:27] <snuggs> its been a huge while since I have been here
[18:31:36] <Whirl3d_> snuggs, enough with the spam, please
[18:31:46] <snuggs> Whirl3d_: no span dude
[18:31:50] <snuggs> swear!
[18:32:30] <snuggs> Its nostalgic
[18:33:36] <snuggs> Whirl3d_: I'm curious why you thought that
[18:35:07] <snuggs> for some people this is therapeutic
[18:36:31] <snuggs> Whirl3d_: are you a bot?
[18:36:40] <RohanBhangui> lol psychiatric session
[18:36:44] <RohanBhangui> no he isnt
[18:36:46] <RohanBhangui> real person
[18:37:08] <snuggs> RohanBhangui:  thanks
[18:37:12] <RohanBhangui> np
[18:37:16] <RohanBhangui> i know what you mean snuggs
[18:37:26] <RohanBhangui> but not the best place to connect your mind to
[18:37:28] <snuggs> RohanBhangui: thank you again
[18:37:32] <RohanBhangui> np
[18:38:45] <snuggs> RohanBhangui: honestly its hard to find a community that connects and understands.  I have the premonition that everyone will understand me.  I know that is the wrong idea
[18:38:58] <RohanBhangui> lol
[18:58:08] <donkeycongo> What's used for the static->fixed header on forbes.com?
[19:08:17] <licryle> I've got an issue with jquery and it's related dom manipulation. Basically, I copy an element with some jquery data, to reinsert it several times in the page, but the inserted one is not parsed by jquery
[19:11:13] <shoky> parsed by jquery?
[19:11:23] <shoky> jquery ain't no stinkin' parser
[19:12:30] <licryle> shoky> hum, let's rephrase, not ... treated? elements are not rendered the same way as static ones
[19:12:41] <licryle> shoky> as if they were not initialized
[19:13:14] <shoky> what initialization do you expect them to undertake?
[19:13:58] <shoky> what do you expect reality to be, vs, what is reality.
[19:14:01] <licryle> shoky> maybe jquery mobile is a bit different but I have a menu, defined by... (2 sec, getting pastebin)
[19:14:35] <licryle> shoky> http://pastebin.com/w4yAkH6t
[19:14:52] <licryle> shoky> I duplicate that piece and inject it in different pages
[19:15:11] <licryle> shoky> if static, all jquery "data-" is used for a rendering
[19:15:18] <shoky> without closing the div?
[19:15:22] <licryle> shoky> if injected, it's not picked up
[19:15:34] <licryle> shoky> my copy/poaste is one line short
[19:15:39] <licryle> sorry
[19:16:09] <shoky> ok well you were right about jqmobile being different.. jquery doesnt care about any data-attributes
[19:16:38] <shoky> jquery doesnt do any rendering and doesnt parse/treat your elements
[19:16:52] <shoky> no idea about jqmobile ;P
[19:17:13] <shoky> i suppose you have to call some method for refreshing the view
[19:17:40] <fuchstronaut> can you post some JS code licryle?
[19:17:50] <licryle> shoky> yeah, it didn't like the listview('refresh'), it said it wasn't initialized, but I can't find an initialization method in the jqm
[19:18:37] <shoky> licryle if you make a jsfiddle with what youve tried so far, people will try to make it work for you
[19:18:50] <shoky> me included
[19:19:03] <licryle> fuchstronaut> sure, http://pastebin.com/mZXhEfq3
[19:19:07] <licryle> shoky> jsfiddle ?
[19:19:16] <shoky> licryle: www.jsfiddle.net
[19:19:45] <licryle> hum... ok never used that, I got out of touch with web dev 3-4 y ago :D
[19:20:01] <shoky> choose jquery  instead of mootools on the left
[19:20:11] <shoky> and check jquery mobile
[19:20:25] <shoky> and you can add any other js/css with 'add resources'
[19:20:58] <shoky> (dont need any <html> or <body> in the HTML part)
[19:21:41] <licryle> pretty sweet
[19:22:15] <shoky> donno how great it works with jqmobile.. but i remember seeing it work for some people
[19:22:42] <shoky> getting a weird error when i put your html in
[19:23:30] <licryle> shoky> which is ?
[19:23:32] <shoky> ah nvm
[19:23:40] <licryle> so far no luck with fiddle, doesn't render jqm
[19:24:02] <shoky> maybe need to include the css too
[19:24:04] <fuchstronaut> what is not working for you, licryle?
[19:24:10] <fuchstronaut> in your code
[19:24:21] <fuchstronaut> the last one is not inserted?
[19:24:33] <licryle> fuchstronaut> so basically, it is inserted, but not rendered as jqm would render it
[19:24:47] <donkeycongo> What would be the way of making the static->fixed header on forbes.com?
[19:24:52] <licryle> fuchstronaut> a.k.a. jqm doesn't pick up the insertion
[19:25:23] <fuchstronaut> so the element is not inserted into DOM?
[19:25:48] <licryle> fuchstronaut> it completely is, it's just the jqm not seeing it and not "parsing" it for better rendering
[19:25:52] <licryle> (all the data- elements)
[19:30:16] <shoky> licryle it seems to work better on jsfiddle when you manually include jqm js and css: http://jsfiddle.net/yVwDY/
[19:30:19] <licryle> fuchstronaut> shoky> Oh! I rthink I found it -- and soryr to bother you, it really lies in jqm
[19:30:53] <licryle> it does half of what I asked but that's already something...
[19:31:00] <shoky> no prob. this is jqm support channel also
[19:31:27] <licryle> shoky> thx :) so the partial answer, so far, is to call listview() on the ul
[19:31:30] <shoky> but you need to mention that when asking the question, upstart ;P
[19:32:12] <licryle> shoky> yeah, I was kind of blur on wht is jq and jqm, I just got back to dev very recently, and had never used either -- totally my fault
[19:39:05] <licryle> gotcha, found the .trigger("create")
[19:40:28] <shoky> i managed to do it here with just calling .listview() after appending it to the DOM:  http://jsfiddle.net/yVwDY/1/
[19:42:13] <licryle> shoky> that's what I was mentioning earlier, that's a (partial) solution
[19:42:28] <licryle> partial because it doesn't apply all styles in all situations... and I can't say why yet
[19:43:01] <shoky> how are you copying the elements ?
[19:43:18] <shoky> oh you pasted it
[19:43:44] <shoky> so you're .cloning the elemtns, after they've already been enhanced by jqm ?
[19:44:14] <shoky> sounds like a recipe for failure
[19:44:36] <shoky> then again, i dont know jqm
[19:44:37] <licryle> shoky> hum, they shouldn't be enhanced when I clone
[19:45:33] <licryle> they're not
[19:46:12] <shoky> oh. i thought jqm automatically enhances them on  page load
[19:46:31] <shoky> like in my earlier fiddle
[19:46:58] <licryle> shoky> only if the menu appears on one page, in my case, I put it out of any page, so I can copy it
[19:47:11] <shoky> ah
[19:47:31] <licryle> shoky> is there any debug console in fiddle ?
[19:47:55] <licryle> just gives me the blank ...
[19:48:15] <shoky> licryle: your browsers console should show you any errors/logs
[19:48:44] <shoky> licryle: if you want you can use 'jquery (edge)' instead of 1.7.2  and then you can check 'firebug' smth and get an embedded firebug console
[19:50:14] <licryle> shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/YPQHW/7/
[19:50:15] <shoky> licryle: works fine http://jsfiddle.net/yVwDY/2/
[19:50:23] <licryle> you'll see the herratic behavior
[19:51:02] <shoky> what behavior?
[19:51:36] <licryle> shoky> 1. colors should be green and orange for the navbar at the bottom 2. try clicking on icons and sometimes it appears as active, sometimesno
[19:57:26] <licryle> gotcha with a refresh!
[19:59:20] <licryle> ok still another half of the remaining issue...
[19:59:53] <shoky> refresh how?
[20:00:26] <shoky> btw cleaned your code a little.. http://jsfiddle.net/YPQHW/8/
[20:01:20] <licryle> shoky> didn't know pages.each... thanks! For the if, I prefer to keep it :)
[20:01:36] <licryle> shoky> otherwise, what about sub pages...
[20:03:25] <shoky> no, don't keep that if :) it's wrong
[20:03:29] <licryle> shoky ?
[20:03:38] <shoky> jq objects will never evaluate to false.
[20:03:41] <shoky> even if they are empty
[20:03:50] <licryle> ok, I ll evaluate the length
[20:03:56] <shoky> and running a method on an empty jq object doesn't do anything, jquery takes care of it for you
[20:03:59] <shoky> why be messy
[20:04:28] <databack> I need to make a sharp looking menu for a ASP.NET application....Anyone have any suggestions?
[20:04:50] <databack> I get one shot...It as to impress
[20:04:53] <databack> has
[20:05:13] <licryle> shoky> ah! then I understand... I'm kind of attached to have proper coding than falling into fail safe though (calling a method on a non existant result for me is a fail)
[20:05:39] <shoky> licryle yea im with you, but it really isn't needed with jquery objects ;P
[20:06:10] <licryle> shoky> pretty sure if I ever read the style book... :p
[20:06:25] <licryle> shoky> see in the js fiddle? try to click on pages back and forth
[20:06:34] <licryle> shoky> the styles are not applied correctly...
[20:06:46] <shoky> yea.. no idea bout that sry
[20:07:19] <shoky> but at least now you have a proper fiddle to link here ;>
[20:07:32] <shoky> someone will come along who can help you
[20:07:37] <licryle> shoky> no worries, it's purely jqm ... pretty annoying, I found quite some features that are like that. Great out of the box, but don't create too much because it falls apart...
[20:08:05] <licryle> hehe thanks :) that stuff is great!
[20:08:09] <shoky> ;]
[20:09:23] <licryle> shoky> time to sleep ... 4 am!
[20:10:40] <licryle> thanks,m good night!
[20:16:44] <jiameka> Hi, I have a question about an ajax function that must be translated for a linux webserver.
[20:20:33] <Dr-Bombay> can't imagine why it would have to be translated
[20:26:00] <jiameka> ajax is M$
[20:36:50] <systemfault> lol
[20:36:59] <shoky> not since.. 2001? or smth
[20:37:28] <systemfault> AJAX is a cleanser
[20:37:53] <systemfault> http://brandsway.intuitwebsites.com/AJAX.JPG :D
[20:38:36] <shoky> it's also a ghost town in utah
[20:39:11] * bperry hopes we are dead tonight
[20:39:18] <thomedy> what up everyone im almost there
[20:39:19] <systemfault> Ajax is good with http://www.mrcase.com/images/177070.jpg
[20:39:22] <shoky> actually it's a hole in the ground
[20:39:22] <thomedy> i got rid of all the hicups
[20:39:40] <bperry> I am trying to make a div that I .show() to show from the right
[20:39:42] <bperry> not the left
[20:39:43] <shoky> LoL
[20:39:53] <thomedy> i put .load in the call back and im good again
[20:40:32] <wsargent> so, I'm a complete JS noob
[20:40:40] <wsargent> is require.js something I should worry about now?
[20:40:46] <shoky> no
[20:40:48] <wsargent> or should I just leave it until I have a problem?
[20:40:48] <systemfault> wsargent: Not really
[20:41:00] <systemfault> wsargent: For now, I'd learn JS if I were you
[20:41:02] <wsargent> okay
[20:41:08] <wsargent> I played with dojo
[20:41:19] <wsargent> but it looks like there's the jquery + everyone else way
[20:41:23] <wsargent> and then there's the dojo way
[20:41:28] <wsargent> not much mixing
[20:43:29] <bperry> I found this that explains pretty much what I want
[20:43:31] <bperry> http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui/browse_thread/thread/f8c6d5c58a052b3c
[20:43:34] <bperry> no answer though
[20:48:15] <shoky> bperry: http://jsfiddle.net/nhBxq/6/
[20:49:51] <bperry> yeah, but I have a function where that {direction} is
[20:50:08] <bperry> not a js guy normally
[20:50:31] <bperry> $('.userMenu').hide("fast", function hideLogout() {
[20:50:58] <yaazkal> Hello. This is hard to explain for me but I'll try. I have version 1 of one page that I made: Using zoomy plugin I "capture" the click and identify if the user has clicked some character on a photo, then change the photo for other... it was working well. Now I have version 2 of the same, but now I'm using transition between "slides" with jmpress plugin. I found that the click event is not triggered on my photos or links and even the div than contain the
[20:50:59] <yaazkal> photo. You can see version 1 on www.alasdemariposa.com/test/w and version 2 on www.alasdemariposa.com/test/e   any idea why I can't catch the click event on version 2 ?

[21:03:41] <tomasm-> hi, i'm having problems using jquery to embed a google map into an iframe dialog box....chrome says "Unsafe Javascript attempt to access frame with URL (http://maps.gstatic.com/....) from frame with URL http://maps.google.com/.... Domains, protocols and ports must match # Note the different domains
[21:03:58] <tomasm-> all I do is use the iframe code from maps.google.com that it provides for an address. any ideas?
[21:07:28] <thomedy> okay im confused i read the .unbind() doc on jquery.com and it said
[21:07:56] <thomedy> that i can unbind an event from within the event with $(this).unbind(event) with event being an argument to event itself
[21:08:03] <thomedy> i did that and im still calling the event
[21:08:07] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[21:12:21] <tomasm-> thomedy, where is this jquery code supposedly doing this?
[21:12:35] <thomedy> im making a jsfiddle right now
[21:12:38] <thomedy> one sec please
[21:13:51] <tomasm-> what the heck is with the bouncing navigation when you have the window focused or not
[21:14:08] <thomedy> are you tlaking to me?
[21:14:26] <dErFuX> @tomasm- Crossframe-Scripting is not allowed, try change the iframe.src to same domain url then redirect =)
[21:14:44] <tomasm-> not sure what 'tlaking' is, but talking, yeah
[21:15:04] <thomedy> then im not sure what your tlaking/talking about what is bouncing
[21:15:34] <tomasm-> dErFuX, redirect? didnt think of that. would that work in an iframe? I don't think redirecting an ajax call would work
[21:15:58] <tomasm-> thomedy, I clicked on "men", and then when I move the mouse around, the "suits, jackets, pants, tops, etc..." navigation slides left/right when the browser window gets focus/blurred
[21:16:21] <thomedy> i have to unbind the mouse enter mouse leave
[21:17:11] <tomasm-> and when I move the mouse quickly over the screen and off the screen, back and forth, maybe a dozen times, the words "bounce", they go back and forth that many times
[21:17:42] <thomedy> my goal right now is to fix the slide switch top menu this is not the first draft i probably just forgot the .stop(true) on that one
[21:17:44] <thomedy> but ill get to it
[21:18:18] <tomasm-> it's actually quite amusing, i'd keep it.
[21:18:28] <thomedy> right now i have to if you click the on m or w or c or d in the top left
[21:19:01] <thomedy> it slides the new page slides in and then back out... i named the function taht animates that slide to start with and then i tried unbind(name) but its not working
[21:19:18] <tomasm-> dErFuX, will redirects work within an iframe? i know that ajax redirects wont.
[21:21:34] <tomasm-> thomedy, fiddle?
[21:21:53] <dErFuX> tomasm-, this seems to be an chrome error: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43173
[21:22:09] <dErFuX> try the maps api
[21:22:30] <thomedy> okay i fixed that bounce in the hover
[21:22:45] <thomedy> and ill get that fiddle right now
[21:23:14] <tomasm-> dErFuX, yeah i noticed that.... i may just settle with a full page map for now, rather than mess with the api
[21:24:16] <thomedy> okay i have no idea what this is
[21:24:18] <thomedy> but http://jsfiddle.net/EKPKX/
[21:24:29] <thomedy> i am getting something that was not in the site but it is a direct cp/paste
[21:24:54] <tomasm-> oh god. good luck
[21:26:01] <thomedy> you saw right that is weird
[21:26:05] <thomedy> why is it so different
[21:26:08] <thomedy> thats weird
[21:28:20] <tomasm-> hmmm, how do I encode html entities like +, &, etc into %XX, etc equivalents, using jquery/js?
[21:28:57] <thomedy> wtf
[21:29:02] <thomedy> thats so weird
[21:29:47] <dErFuX> tomasm-: .html()
[21:30:14] <tomasm-> dErFuX, huh?
[21:30:41] <dErFuX> how to encode htmlentities? ->  .html()
[21:31:18] <b__> h
[21:31:50] <tomasm-> dErFuX, I dont follow.... I've always used html() to set the innerHTML for an object, not to translate a string
[21:32:28] <tomasm-> I have a string I need encoded because I'm passing a full url as a parameter to another url.... i'm not trying to add it to the dom anywhere
[21:33:19] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/EKPKX/3/
[21:33:30] <thomedy> now im getting a post request error but i took out the .load
[21:33:33] <thomedy> what am imissing
[21:36:39] <dErFuX> tomasm-: encodeURI
[21:36:58] <tomasm-> dErFuX, yeah, thanks
[21:37:31] <dErFuX> np
[21:38:37] <thomedy> can i use bind like you do live
[21:38:55] <thomedy> so ().bind() = ().live()
[21:39:19] <tomasm-> what about on() ? i thought live() is deprecated
[21:39:53] <tomasm-> bind() will work if the item is in the page on page load... if it's added later via ajax, on() is better
[21:40:19] <thomedy> just whatever for example.... $('div').bind('click', function(){}), $('div').live('click', function(){})
[21:40:41] <systemfault> thomedy: 2 different things
[21:40:59] <thomedy> okay thank you this may be the reason my $this.unbind(handler)
[21:41:01] <thomedy> isn't working
[21:41:09] <thomedy> cuz it seems in the page on jquery.com
[21:41:10] <systemfault> .bind attaches an event handler on the element… the other on the document
[21:41:23] <thomedy> that those are bound with bind mine is live cuz i load it
[21:41:49] <thomedy> so anchors that arent in the dom to start with need to have the same behaviors
[21:42:28] <systemfault> thomedy: take a look at .die()
[21:42:37] <thomedy> im so close.. i jus tgotta get this figured out and for some reason the copy past ei put in js fiddle are behaving from differently from the site i cpied them from
[21:42:43] <thomedy> i will thank you so much system fault
[21:42:44] <systemfault> anyway.. .live should not be used.
[21:42:47] <tomasm-> yeah if you unbind an event on the wrong object... (not the one called on) it might not work
[21:43:50] <thomedy> okay that makes sense thank you so much
[21:43:53] <tomasm-> thomedy, you can also use names for the event, if it's namespaced, to not interfere with other behavior... ie click.foobar (as long as both in bind and unbind)
[21:44:20] <thomedy> i have a name i havne't learned how to namespace yet
[21:44:40] <thomedy> but i have var name = $('element').live('click', function(){})
[21:44:55] <thomedy> so i plan on $('*').die(name)
[21:44:59] <thomedy> does that sound reasonable
[21:45:17] <thomedy> or prob $('a').die(name)
[21:46:43] <dErFuX> any1 here with innodb+transaction experience? :D
[21:47:09] <tomasm-> I dont see die() in the docs allowing for functions to be passed, nor do I see docs saying that live() returns the handler
[21:47:36] <tomasm-> thomedy, I would switch to on() and off() before going any further
[22:03:18] <shoky> t
[22:07:08] <thomedy> can i rebind an event after killing it with die
[22:07:27] <shoky> of course
[22:07:32] <shoky> but thomedy
[22:07:37] <shoky> just use on and off :\
[22:07:41] <thomedy> im trying to  update my jquery install right now
[22:07:50] <thomedy> sorry im using a drupal install so its not just a new file
[22:07:55] <shoky> :(
[22:07:56] <thomedy> im trying to figure out how
[22:08:14] <thomedy> i can write modules in php and i can write themes and i can do almost everything but i dont usually config much
[22:08:21] <thomedy> cuz i prefere to write my own code
[22:08:35] <thomedy> when i do i end up with an endless battle of how someone else wrote their code
[22:08:44] <thomedy> ie the current jquery instal situation
[22:08:51] <shoky> what jq ver?
[22:09:03] <thomedy> ummm i think 1.3 might be 1.26
[22:09:06] <thomedy> i think
[22:09:13] <thomedy> let me check
[22:09:14] <shoky> ohhhh~
[22:09:38] <thomedy> i know its 1.7 now
[22:09:59] <thomedy> but the problem with doing this project tha tim building myself is im not good enough plain and simple
[22:10:05] <thomedy> im doing a multi vendor fashion stor
[22:10:10] <thomedy> so im just not good enough
[22:10:18] <thomedy> i need a cms like drupal and drupal is solid
[22:10:43] <shoky> is it
[22:10:46] <thomedy> plus im not a team of 10 developers its jus tme
[22:10:49] <thomedy> seems like it
[22:10:58] <thomedy> like i said i really do prefer writing my own code
[22:11:02] <thomedy> but thers so much i dont know yet
[22:11:13] <thomedy> especially in the web
[22:11:40] <thomedy> i have done robotics in college and im fairly solid on its concepts but im teaching myself the web
[22:11:43] <shoky> i see even the current drupal version uses jquery 1.5
[22:12:44] <thomedy> so im limited at times but the trade off is very complex things like api's to paypal, and security,(im no good at that YET) and ecommerce
[22:12:59] <shoky> who are you talking to
[22:13:14] <thomedy> i thought i was talking to you but apparently no one
[22:13:44] * thomedy shuts up
[22:13:44] <shoky> you're being defensive, but no one said anything about your knowledge/skills
[22:14:07] <thomedy> no im not really defensive at all i just know my limitations at this point
[22:14:10] <thomedy> im not offended at all
[22:14:33] <thomedy> and i also know how driven i am so i am trying to explain the best i can
[22:14:35] <thomedy> any way
[22:14:39] <thomedy> no worries
[22:14:42] <shoky> lawl ok
[22:15:07] <shoky> so, what drupal version are you using?
[22:15:08] <thomedy> but with out any defensive ness at all (to be clear) im working my ass off to learn as fast i can.. cuz i enjoy web stuff
[22:15:19] <shoky> thats great ;)
[22:15:19] <thomedy> you said i can rebind stuff
[22:15:23] <shoky> yes
[22:15:36] <thomedy> give me a doc i ll read it myself i dont want to make you do my job
[22:16:01] <shoky> rebinding is just like binding
[22:16:07] <shoky> there's no special doc for that
[22:16:07] <shoky> ;P
[22:16:21] <thomedy> okay so can jus tgo .live and do it again
[22:16:25] <shoky> sure
[22:16:28] <systemfault> HI LOL
[22:16:31] <shoky> i think so
[22:16:42] <shoky> HEY, MAN, LIKE, HI
[22:16:54] <thomedy> WORTH A SHOT.... sorry the room got louder
[22:16:58] <shoky> LOLING MY AS OFF
[22:17:07] <systemfault> Everyday I'm jqueryin'!
[22:17:49] <shoky> my code says exception to line 56, what can be does?
[22:19:23] <shoky> no help to me?
[22:22:17] <systemfault> shoky: You're way too cool to have jQuery issues.
[22:25:21] <Whirl3d_> anuybody know of a placeholder generator that you can get a simple menu to use as a placeholder for a demo?
[22:29:03] <kennett85> I'm trying to make it so when you click on a div the checkbox is checked/unchecked.
[22:30:06] <kennett85> I can get it to work in jsFiddle but not on the web page.
[22:30:11] <kennett85> http://jsfiddle.net/kennett85/hgurk/
[22:30:41] <thomedy> i may have gotten it
[22:30:43] <thomedy> im still doing testing
[22:30:55] <thomedy> but im not sure what i did to fix it.. i erased the die()
[22:30:59] <thomedy> and it seemed to work fine
[22:31:05] <thomedy> but i swear it was broken before
[22:32:01] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: placeholder generator?
[22:32:58] <johnkpaul> kennett85: what is the problem on the webpage? can you show an example?
[22:33:52] <kennett85> johnkpaul: When I click on the div the checkbox does not check.
[22:34:00] <Whirl3d_> yeah, you know after you have been typing all day trying to get something done and you just don't feel like looking through your old shit to find your standard UL list turned into a basic menu...I'd like a place that I could enter numbers and it would work it out for me.
[22:34:11] <Whirl3d_> http://www.quackit.com/html/html_table_generator.cfm
[22:34:25] <Whirl3d_> kind of like a lorem ipsum generator on acid...
[22:34:39] <johnkpaul> kennett85: your event is on a dd element, not a div
[22:35:08] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: perhaps look into zencoding in whatever ide
[22:35:15] <johnkpaul> http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/
[22:35:57] <johnkpaul> where you can type ul>li*10>ul>li*2>a and it'll become the whole html
[22:36:15] <kennett85> johnkpaul: I changed it to div and still doesn't work.
[22:36:46] <johnkpaul> works in the fiddle in chrome 19, osx
[22:37:04] <shoky> <3 zencoding
[22:37:11] <Whirl3d_> though I appreciate the link, I just don't think there's ennough storage space left in my brain to learn another symbolic language...I'm storing up brain cells for an intense crash course in C in the fall...
[22:37:24] <shoky> and <3 webstorm for having it builtin & enabled for you by default
[22:37:28] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: well, the whole idea is that it's not a _new_ symbolic language
[22:37:36] <Whirl3d_> right...
[22:37:36] <johnkpaul> it's just css selectors, with a slight addition
[22:37:53] <Whirl3d_> just like french is just spanish with different spellings..but
[22:37:53] <johnkpaul> to do what you're asking for would be ul>li*number
[22:37:55] <Whirl3d_> lol
[22:38:02] <johnkpaul> you think it's that different?
[22:38:14] <thomedy> seriously i dont know what why removing die fixed it but im think i got it now
[22:38:18] <Whirl3d_> no not at all, I was just pokin fun...
[22:38:22] <thomedy> i m not seeing any bugs any more
[22:38:27] <tman> can someone give me a hand, i'm trying to get my head around how to scale a font-size such that the h1 will always be a height of =<80 px
[22:38:28] <johnkpaul> ah, :)
[22:38:34] <tman> i have an example if someone wants to help
[22:38:45] <thomedy> i just got to add another load functionf or the content on other animations and then set up the css on the loaded content and im done
[22:38:50] <thomedy> wtf but in a good way
[22:41:30] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d_: http://html-ipsum.com/
[22:41:41] <johnkpaul> boom, made that just for you
[22:41:56] <johnkpaul> and my made that, I mean googled ;)
[22:42:44] <Whirl3d_> I have been googling for a while and didn't come across that. what terms did you use:
[22:42:58] <johnkpaul> ?g ul li generator
[22:42:58] <caniuse> johnkpaul: HTML List Generator - http://www.mattsbits.co.uk/webtools/html_list_generator/
[22:43:04] <Whirl3d_> oh, and sorry, THANK you...
[22:43:13] <johnkpaul> :) no problem!
[22:43:22] <johnkpaul> google gives differently ordered results sometimes I suppose
[22:43:38] <johnkpaul> for me, the I'm feeling lucky link was html-ipsum.com
[22:44:10] <Whirl3d_> Hey did you ever write up your prefix script?
[22:45:20] <johnkpaul> the evented jquery method script, you mean?
[22:45:35] <johnkpaul> no, not completely
[22:45:43] <johnkpaul> it's very high up on the list of priorities though
[22:46:16] <Whirl3d_> yes. that's it.
[22:46:43] <Whirl3d_> you should show shoky. It's nothing short of brilliant.
[22:47:00] <johnkpaul> ha, I don't know about that, definitely helpful at times
[22:47:07] <johnkpaul> I think that I have mentioned it to shoky
[22:48:39] <Whirl3d_> I think he may have dozed off.
[22:48:56] <johnkpaul> eh, that's ok, I need to do the same
[22:49:03] <johnkpaul> it's almost 2AM in my timezone
[22:49:14] <Whirl3d_> I was just getting dressed to hit theclubs... same here
[22:49:36] <johnkpaul> haha, lucky
[22:49:41] <Whirl3d_> really just a bar around the corner that I play pinball in LOL
[22:49:57] <Whirl3d_> but it reminds me of my clubbin' days when I call it "hitting the clubs" lol
[22:50:25] <johnkpaul> haha have fun out there, I was going to say to make sure that one fist pump was for me, but I suppose it'll be one round of pinball
[22:50:52] <Whirl3d_> no dobut. Will do.
[22:50:53] <thomedy> okay if you  guys see any bugs let me know but i think i got it
[22:50:58] <johnkpaul> have a good night, Whirl3d_
[22:51:03] <thomedy> i havent stylized the content being .loaded
[22:51:05] <Whirl3d_> you too. Always a pleasure.
[22:51:08] <thomedy> but...
[22:51:11] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[22:51:13] <thomedy> check it out
[22:52:45] <Whirl3d_> thomedy, there's no content in their right. We are just supposed to be checking out the smooth animation of the menu right?
[22:52:49] <thomedy> right
[22:52:57] <thomedy> just it took alot of education for the animations
[22:53:00] <thomedy> and i want that
[22:53:17] <thomedy> i think the main thing i can take from this is that as far as i can tell everything can have a call back
[22:53:26] <thomedy> and using the callback is what smoothed everything out
[22:53:57] <thomedy> .live i learned that... and unbind, and a host of other things and now as soon as  i stylize crap im off to teach my self about jquery namespaces and how to write a plug in
[22:54:05] <thomedy> i know namespces from c++ and what not
[22:54:10] <thomedy> but webstuff now
[22:54:10] <Whirl3d_> you need to add queue:false to your animations.
[22:54:20] <thomedy> oooooh i was going to look up queue and figure out
[22:54:24] <thomedy> cuz something is off i know
[22:54:29] <thomedy> what is that for and super pre thank you
[22:55:04] <Whirl3d_> if you click the wcd in the top kind of fast, the animations clump up
[22:55:10] <Whirl3d_> and queue up
[22:56:05] <Whirl3d_> And I noticed that you aren't using a hash-tag system so you can't go back
[22:56:11] <Whirl3d_> and you can't bookmark a page
[22:57:12] <thomedy> i was going to add taht once i got the animations up and running
[22:57:19] <Whirl3d_> plus, currently there's no way to go directly to any specific content on your site. If I wanted to tell someone to check out this bitch's skirt on your site, they would have to find it themselves.
[22:57:20] <thomedy> and i just found out that ie hates me
[22:57:29] <thomedy> actually ther is
[22:57:33] <thomedy> click designers
[22:57:42] <thomedy> or d if your on another page
[22:58:52] <rabbi1> how to index the last only tab in uitabs ?
[22:59:03] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky FUCK YOU IM DURNK N UR NOT HERE GOD DAM,NIT
[22:59:03] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[22:59:09] <abjorn> SUP GUYS
[22:59:14] <abjorn> ILL HELP WITH UR JQUERIES
[22:59:28] <Whirl3d_> Yeah. I think you have done a great job with the animation...but looking to the bel allmans updatehash plugin...it's pretty cool and easy to implement.
[23:00:01] <Whirl3d_> then you could go to http://www.thesartorer.com/designers#thomedy-websites....
[23:00:17] <thomedy> and then i have a yes i realy really really need that let me figure out how to add queue:false
[23:00:20] <Whirl3d_> and it would show you website designs by thomedy, 8)
[23:00:22] <thomedy> and then ill ad that hash
[23:00:39] <abjorn> >mfw everyone ignores me
[23:00:39] <abjorn> good job
[23:00:49] <Whirl3d_> thomedy...you will have to change your animation calls to look like this:
[23:01:02] <Whirl3d_> abjorn you drunk bitch, what's up?
[23:01:18] <thomedy> i am giddy ill be honest.. im sitting here working, unable to sit still
[23:01:21] <thomedy> im really excited
[23:01:23] <Whirl3d_> var elem.animate(props, opts);
[23:01:29] <thomedy> i have been working and re working this for al ong time
[23:01:50] <Whirl3d_> where props is an object that has your properties and values to animate to
[23:01:57] <abjorn> Whirl3d_: heeeeeeeeeeeeeey
[23:01:59] <abjorn> not much
[23:02:01] <abjorn> my friends just lieft
[23:02:02] <abjorn> left
[23:02:02] <rabbi1> how to get ui.index of last tab?
[23:02:21] <Whirl3d_> and opts contains: {easing:easingfunction, duration:time, step:stepcallback, complete:completeCallback, and queue:false}
[23:02:53] <Whirl3d_> you had friends over drinking?
[23:03:12] <thomedy> oh  jesus that looks a bit complicated im going to google it too... thank you
[23:03:15] <Whirl3d_> rabbi1, $(".tabclass").last()
[23:03:16] <Whirl3d_> ?
[23:03:31] <Whirl3d_> thomedy it's easy
[23:03:33] <thomedy> i havent set up my anims like elem.anim
[23:03:34] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/14/
[23:03:39] <thomedy> so i might have to redo some stuff
[23:03:48] <Whirl3d_> how did you do you animations
[23:03:48] <thomedy> but if i have to and i do thn you do it right?
[23:03:51] <thomedy> okay im on it
[23:04:04] <thomedy> $('#elem').animate()
[23:04:04] <kennett85> When I click on  div all the checkboxes check and then I can't uncheck them.
[23:04:13] <thomedy> the way i taught myself when i started al this
[23:04:18] <kennett85> http://affordablehomesinc.co/13-test.php
[23:04:52] <thomedy> oh i see
[23:04:59] <thomedy> i can just add queue:false to a callback
[23:05:15] <thomedy> i was looking at the whole when the point of it seems to be the callback
[23:05:38] <Whirl3d_> you put an object as your second parameter in animate
[23:05:55] <Whirl3d_> the object replaces your current easing, duration, and callback...
[23:06:14] <Whirl3d_> by {easing:"easeOutBack", duration:500, complete:callback}
[23:06:48] <Whirl3d_> but it gives you access to queue:ftrue/false and step:callback    whiich happens at each incremental change in your animation
[23:07:25] <Whirl3d_> rabi1, what are you asking?
[23:08:15] <raj_> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[23:08:31] <raj_> hi h r?
[23:08:46] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: i need to hide a div in all tabs except the last tab....
[23:09:09] <Whirl3d_> so currently you hide it in the first one
[23:09:46] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: yeah
[23:10:07] <Whirl3d_> so you could set a variable to the tabcount outside your tabs function then if (ui.index==tabcount-1) {hide stuff
[23:11:52] <rabbi1> Whirl3d_: ok great :)
[23:12:33] <Whirl3d_> and cache the reference to the common div. No need to search the dom each time you click a tab
[23:16:55] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TTTLw/23/
[23:18:38] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TTTLw/24/
[23:20:56] <kennett85> Can any1 help me. I can get this to work but when I put it on my page it doesn't work.  http://jsfiddle.net/kennett85/hgurk/2/
[23:21:49] <Whirl3d_> kennett85, first of all, don't use .live if you can avoid it. Can you use the latest version of jquery?
[23:23:17] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: I'm new to js and jQuery. I have jquery-1.7.2 on my server if thats what you mean.
[23:24:10] <Murg|e> Anyone know of a tutorial online that explains how to serialize jqueryUI connected lists to update mysql?  I've google'd for awhile but haven't found anything clear.
[23:24:13] <Whirl3d_> Cool. You need to be using the .on handler rather than .live
[23:25:19] <Whirl3d_> so you want to toggle all of the checkbox selected attributes on click
[23:25:20] <thomedy> will e.returnValue = false work for e.preventDefault in internet explorer i googled and found that as a result
[23:26:09] <kennett85> I just want one at a time.
[23:26:40] <Whirl3d_> then you don't have to worrk about check and uncheck, that's buil into the control...
[23:27:05] <Whirl3d_> wait...I think i see what you want now
[23:27:06] <Whirl3d_> lol
[23:34:23] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: When I use 1.7.2 and changed .live to .on it will let me check but not uncheck.
[23:35:54] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hgurk/13/
[23:39:19] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hgurk/16/
[23:39:31] <thomedy> okay queue false i think i got it
[23:39:33] <thomedy> im getting tiered
[23:39:42] <thomedy> so i think ill style the content tommorrow
[23:40:06] <Whirl3d_> cool. I'll try to work up an idea for ya.
[23:40:38] <Whirl3d_> kennett85, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hgurk/17/
[23:40:43] <thomedy> when i build queue false it doesn't do the custom animation
[23:42:32] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: Let me try it.
[23:48:44] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: It works in jsfiddle but not on my page
[23:49:59] <Whirl3d_> link?
[23:50:10] <kennett85> To my page?
[23:50:18] <Whirl3d_> yeah
[23:50:28] <kennett85> http://affordablehomesinc.co/13-test.php
[23:52:59] <Whirl3d_> look in your console. there's an error
[23:53:22] <Lost123> hi
[23:54:19] <Lost123> if i want to replace the of the div afer slide show ends, how can i do it?
[23:54:23] <kennett85> Whirl3d_: It says "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL "
[23:54:59] <Lost123> or if i want to call a funtion after slideshow plays the last slide, what event will i bind my function ?
[23:55:07] <Whirl3d_> kennett85, you are assigning your handlers before you build the things you want to assign them to
[23:55:39] <Whirl3d_> YOu need to put your javascript in the header of your document and all of your scripts inside a funciton like $(document).ready(function () {   do stuff });
[23:56:13] <Whirl3d_> otherwise, you tell it to bind the click event to some elements that don't exist....
[23:56:32] <Whirl3d_> because you load the script BEFORE you put the elements.
[23:57:20] <Whirl3d_> lost123 thats determined by your slideshow. I'd check the docs on it.
[23:59:49] <Lost123> can you please check this Whirl3d_ http://pastie.org/4136489
