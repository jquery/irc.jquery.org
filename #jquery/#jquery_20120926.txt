[00:01:39] <coldhead> hail to thee, BK
[00:01:55] <BinaryKitten> noregret the only thing i can see as an issue is that var p
[00:02:06] <BinaryKitten> since the PHP code will execute without the page var
[00:02:30] <BinaryKitten> as it becomes fixed code not changeable per line
[00:02:39] <noregret> thanks, i 'll check it
[00:05:47] <hariom> I have around 35 checkbox on a page. One of the them is selected by default and can't be unchecked (its mandatory). All the checkboxes have a common class so when needed, I can check them all using $(".common_class").attr("checked", false). Now how to uncheck all except the mandatory checkbox? (not the mandatory checkbox is dynamic; I don't know which of the checkbox is going to be mandatory on next refresh)
[00:05:53] <BinaryKitten> noregret i have to go to the office now but the principles are tehre
[00:06:19] <noregret> yeap, thanks :)
[00:06:22] <BinaryKitten> hariom can you not make that checkbox readonly

[00:08:02] <fRAiLtY-> Hi guys, I'm trying to work out a way of updating an integer through several phases, ending up with a calculation, but I can't seem to get it to add, it just sort of appends making a long number made of up of the 3 put together :x http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/39XNz/9/
[00:08:08] <coldhead> $(':checked').attr('readonly', 'readonly')
[00:08:28] <coldhead> ?mdc parseint @ fRAiLtY-
[00:08:33] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-, parseInt | MDN - Parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix or base. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[00:09:32] <BinaryKitten> fRAiLtY- strings "+" together are concatenated
[00:09:51] <BinaryKitten> use parseInt like coldhead recommended
[00:09:54] <fRAiLtY-> Yeah that's where I got confused, just want to add lol
[00:14:13] <coldhead> it's not your fault, fRAiLtY-, Javascript is badly designed with respect to '+'
[00:14:43] <fRAiLtY-> I'm a little confused by parseInt, is that what I need to "just add 2 numbers" or have I explained it wrong :x
[00:15:11] <mazzachre> How to distinguis between namespaces in jqueryUI widgets? Can I have different widgets with the same name in different namespaces and how do I choose which one is instantiated?
[00:15:36] <BinaryKitten> fRAiLtY- var total = parseInt(number1) + parseInt(number2);
[00:15:54] <fRAiLtY-> Oh I see, sorry, I was doing parseInt(number1,number2)
[00:15:57] <mazzachre> Ya, the basic math part or the std. operator implementation is weird in javascript
[00:15:58] <fRAiLtY-> plank
[00:16:23] <mazzachre> It comes from the bewildering implementation in C
[00:16:27] <shadow_fox> hey guyz need to ask a couple of questions : which jquery i should use for a horizontal onclick slider portfolio?
[00:17:55] <BinaryKitten> shadow_fox there is only 1 jQuery.. if you are asking which of the myriad of jQuery plugins you wish to use.. that is something we can't really advise on
[00:18:02] <hariom> BinaryKitten: I made the mandatory checkbox to readonly but when I uncheck all using $(".common_class").attr("checked", false),   that readonly also gets unchecked
[00:18:03] <BinaryKitten> hey lukosanthropos
[00:18:36] <BinaryKitten> hariom add a .not('[readonly]') in before the attr
[00:18:50] <hariom> BinaryKitten: I see
[00:19:07] <BinaryKitten> lukosanthropos how is it over that side of the penines?
[00:19:08] <shadow_fox> BinaryKitten: ohh that i am not getting. Which will benefit me to do a portfolio :( anyway thanks :)
[00:19:56] <coldhead> oh PENINES, i thought that said something else
[00:20:09] <coldhead> was just about to call the police
[00:23:35] <lukosanthropos> Hey BinaryKitten
[00:24:04] <lukosanthropos> It's Damp
[00:35:52] <hariom> BinaryKitten: That has worked. Thank you.
[00:35:56] <Siridoes> i am trying to find a scroller that would work inside my list only for my mobile site, i am using jqm
[00:36:52] <Siridoes> the basic scroller provided with jqm scrolls the whole page, i just want that 1 list to be scrollable
[00:37:18] <Siridoes> and if any one knows how to use iscroller with jqm that would be sweet :D
[01:15:40] <M3kH> Morning! :)
[01:21:18] <lombrozo> Can anyone explain why the text in the animation at www.omnitek.tv fades in then dissapears?  Thanks...
[01:26:01] <acies> Does jQuery do client-side caching of XHR?
[01:26:36] <xec> lombrozo: some code is doing it ;) what file/line is relevant?
[01:27:12] <timing> lombrozo: it's weird. event when I give .points a red border it's invisible
[01:29:18] <xec> timing: have you found the code that's fading it?
[01:29:36] <timing> xec: nope, I'm looking at the css only
[01:29:49] <timing> to see what kind of opacity stuff is happening
[01:29:59] <timing> (css in the inspector ofcourse)
[01:31:10] <xec> i think it's a z-index issue
[01:33:15] <xec> you can give .main-slider .info-area position: relative;
[01:33:40] <isdp> hello
[01:34:07] <isdp> what is the best way to search on the attribute data-name?
[01:34:22] <isdp> i have a list with spans, wit ha attribute data-name
[01:34:58] <isdp> and i want to replace the text inside of a certain span, searching by the attribute value
[01:35:01] <xec> isdp: relevant? http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[01:36:19] <pingec> What is the difference between $('form > input') and $('form input')
[01:37:06] <xec> "form input" means any input descendant of form while with the > it means immediate children only
[01:37:56] <pingec> ah
[01:37:57] <pingec> thanks
[01:38:14] <xec> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#child-combinators
[01:38:32] <lombrozo> xec: thanks so much! putting position:relative fixed it all! amazing!
[01:39:08] <xec> lombrozo: you're welcome :)
[01:39:23] <lombrozo> xec: so happy
[01:44:00] <isdp> $("#frmSBpak option:selected") how do i do a function () on this?
[01:44:14] <isdp> $("#frmSBpak option:selected").(function () { }); ?
[01:44:20] <xec> .each() ?
[01:44:25] <isdp> ty
[01:44:57] <badbandit> anyone know why .outerHeight() or .height() would be different in firefox vs chrome??
[01:45:59] <AdamPDotty> different default style sheet
[01:51:40] <badbandit> ?
[01:52:52] <badbandit> Im having some strange bug where I wrote a little script to resize a bunch of product boxes based on which one has the longest content... a) it works only on ctrl+shift+R in ff, and b) the heights are different in chrome... serious wtf
[01:52:54] <badbandit> http://www.emergencysupplysolutions.com/products/
[02:04:39] <isdp> how do i count the jQuery .find() results?
[02:04:54] <isdp> if($frmSBpak.find("[data-name=\"" + fName "\"") > 1) ?
[02:07:03] <xec> .length
[02:10:17] <xec> also, if you use single quotes you can save yourself from needing that escaping
[02:10:44] <isdp> xec, http://jsfiddle.net/VqH78/ it's for a simple form
[02:12:01] <xec> if($frmSBpak.find('[data-name="' + fName + '"]').length > 1)
[02:13:03] <xec> isdp: i'm not sure what that demo is trying to demonstrate
[02:14:34] <isdp> xec, a summary list of selected items.
[02:16:14] <lombrozo> the IE7 z-index bug, does that need to be fixed in later versions of IE?
[02:16:58] <xec> if that was the case, why would it be called "the IE7 z-index bug"
[02:18:29] <xec> isdp: so, what's working, what's not, what were you expecting to happen, or what do you want it to do
[02:18:47] <xec> lombrozo: i was just joking btw ;) i don't know
[02:20:24] <ravenzz> xec dude, I have a menu, and whenever a users clicks one item an ajax req is fired. But I would abort the request in case the users clicks another item while the xhr's readyState is 1 (open). Is it fine to have a "global" variable within my function scope to which I assign the current $.ajax request ?
[02:20:42] <xec> ravenzz: don't ask me, ask the channel
[02:21:27] <lombrozo> xec: no worries lol, seems to be pretty intermitent anyway...
[02:22:47] <ravenzz> the channel would read it as well :) I saw you around and I was asking for a feedback
[02:23:18] <xec> ravenzz: it's considered rude to just call someone out without reason like that. especially minutes before lunchtime ;)
[02:23:55] <xec> but the real reason i told you not to address me is because i can't answer you
[02:24:04] <ravenzz> lol
[02:24:35] <ravenzz> I see that in another way, it means that I somehow trust you
[02:24:40] <ravenzz> np
[02:25:38] <xec> no worries, i'm off to lunch :) good luck
[02:28:00] <ravenzz> yep, it makes sense to me, have a good lunch
[02:32:06] <kusiak> Hi, I hope someone can help me, I want to get a html page using jquery and parse it to get some data
[02:32:18] <kusiak>  $.ajax({ 		   url: "http://multikino.pl/", 		   dataType: "text", 		   success: function(data){ 			 alert(data); 			  			 //document.title 		   } 		 });
[02:32:38] <kusiak> i have this, but I have no idea how to use jquery to parse it
[02:35:08] <badbandit> what format is it being returned in
[02:36:24] <ravenzz> badbandit you can't make request to domain other than yours
[02:36:28] <kusiak> its plain html string, quite large
[02:37:10] <kusiak> I am developing Smart TV application, and allowed for cross domain requests
[02:37:18] <badbandit> yes you can
[02:37:22] <badbandit> heard of jsonp?
[02:37:26] <ravenzz> ah of course
[02:37:31] <badbandit> your api needs to be configured for it
[02:38:41] <ravenzz> sure seemed like you weren't requesting jsonp
[02:39:20] <ravenzz> I wonder why the dataType is not jsonp then
[02:39:40] <ravenzz> and why are you asking what format is it being returned lol
[02:43:24] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. If I have a select with 3 options, how can I see the number of the selected option? E.g. if I select the second option, it should return "2" etc.
[02:44:10] <xec> $('select').val() ?
[02:44:20] <ravenzz> ?index @ jaffipaffi
[02:44:26] <bot-t> jaffipaffi, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[02:45:39] <angelazou> how can I get the value of particular property in this json object http://fpaste.org/hb9w/?
[02:46:06] <angelazou> I tried data[0].pid, but the inspector says it's undefined
[02:47:20] <ravenzz> angelazou that seems correct
[02:47:38] <fRAiLtY-> Is there a tool that shows what functions or at least what .js file is being utilised or attempting to be utilised at a point on a webpage? I've got firebug and js console for chrome but this doesn't do that, from what I can see. I'm selecting a drop-down and trying to see what functions/files are "acting" on it as I do it. I have a conflict but not one that is displaying as an error in the console :x
[02:47:39] <ravenzz> oh lol
[02:47:47] <Qdest> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/updatelayout-issue <-- I'm having the exact same issue.. If I touch the page or essentially do anything with it the layout updates.. I just need to trigger that on orientation change. It's regarding a navigation which "slides" down on tap/swipe.
[02:47:53] <angelazou> but when I output the entire object it's valid
[02:47:58] <ravenzz> wrong chan (the lol thing)
[02:48:01] <angelazou> trying anything else than that is not
[02:48:26] <angelazou> ah, i found it
[02:48:37] <angelazou> doing a parseJSON helps
[02:48:37] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/T3REq/
[02:48:47] <ravenzz> ah right
[02:48:48] <Qdest> So basically, when I go from portrait to landscape (and only that) the top menu gets a weird position even though the css is correct. If I tap or do anything it repositions just as it should be.
[02:51:33] <jaffipaffi> ravenzz: I can't get it working :/ http://jsfiddle.net/4abcc/
[02:53:22] <jaffipaffi> ravenzz: Got it.. just used $('select')[0].selectedIndex; instead
[02:53:39] <ravenzz> jaffipaffi http://jsfiddle.net/4abcc/1/
[02:54:33] <jaffipaffi> Yeah
[02:54:39] <jaffipaffi> Thanks
[02:54:48] <ravenzz> yw
[02:55:51] <ravenzz> jaffipaffi your solution is even better I guess
[02:56:41] <Ravindran> jaffipaffi: http://jsfiddle.net/4abcc/2/ this one avoid unnecessary jquery call :)
[02:57:38] <jaffipaffi> Ravindran: Well, that was kinda what I did too: jaffipaffi: ravenzz: Got it.. just used $('select')[0].selectedIndex; instead
[02:57:40] <jaffipaffi> :)
[02:57:57] <jaffipaffi> But yeah.. Good to prevent the jquery call
[02:57:59] <jaffipaffi> Updated
[03:01:01] <ravenzz> Ravindran in order to avoid unnecessary selection you would store $('.which') in a variable outside the change's handler function, then
[03:05:51] <mowol> Hi. I have some selects that i would like the value from. There is no standard selected value, which means that if the select hasnt been changed, i cant pick the selected one. How do i get the value then?
[03:14:55] <mowol> oh, i just need to use val() on the select ;)
[03:38:27] <Noriandir> hi
[03:39:52] <Noriandir> I want to search a certain directory for folders and register their name in some sort of structure that can be processed after. I've been told that I could do that in jquery. but I've no idea how
[03:41:41] <angelazou> Noriandir: there is a plugin here http://www.lateralcode.com/directory-trees-with-php-and-jquery/
[03:46:09] <Noriandir> angelazou: tks. I'll look into it
[03:50:24] <angelazou> I need to do some error messages
[03:50:38] <angelazou> I'd like to use jQuery.error
[03:50:49] <angelazou> but jQuery.error(msg) doesn't seem to work
[03:50:51] <angelazou> why?
[03:52:52] <xec> angelazou: what did you expect it to do?
[03:53:05] <angelazou> output a message and stop all the processing
[03:53:21] <xec> output how
[03:53:30] <angelazou> on the screen or console
[03:53:34] <angelazou> but I didn't see anything
[03:53:58] <xec> it should appear in the console - but it's basically the same as just throwing afaik
[03:54:06] <angelazou> ic
[03:54:07] <angelazou> thanks
[04:04:24] <mowol> Im calling a php file to get an amount when you change the value of a slider. However this slider has many many steps, meaning that the php file is called many many times, causing a delay. Can i do anything to fix this?
[04:06:00] <seutje> mowol: use a timeout or something that delays the call untill it hasn't been fired again within x second
[04:07:11] <mowol> seutje: could you provide any links? :)
[04:08:10] <seutje> nope
[04:08:20] <angelazou> hi
[04:08:49] <angelazou> I was wondering if anyone know where can I translate/replace the 'error loading page' string in jquery mobile?
[04:11:18] <bLUEE> question: if i have a data attritube like data-like="false" when i do $().data('like') can i get a bool object from it ?
[04:11:21] <bLUEE> seems to fail
[04:15:01] <Ravindran> mowol: you can check out throttle/debounce jquery plug-in http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[04:15:05] <noregret> how can I check 3 parents backwords for a certain element ?
[04:15:18] <noregret> should i go elem.parent().parent().parent() ?
[04:15:21] <mowol> thanks Ravindran , ill look into it
[04:15:52] <xec> bLUEE: should work http://jsfiddle.net/hQ8qF/
[04:16:19] <noregret> or how i can check if the current element is under a certain class ?
[04:16:58] <bLUEE> xec: yeh i was reading the docs and says it attempts to resolve them, but when i was doing checks, it fails.. but does it matter if you update using .attr() ?
[04:18:27] <xec> bLUEE: i wouldn't think so, but i would use .data() to store (not use an attribute)
[04:19:10] <bLUEE> xec: hmm i was using attr to update since i could see it reflected in the inspector :/
[04:19:20] <xec> bLUEE: are you setting a string?
[04:19:39] <bLUEE> xec: well using attr i was ..
[04:20:12] <bLUEE> xec: i guess i should update using data then// too bad you cant see it in the inspector tho !
[04:23:37] <lombrozo> can anyone tell me how to set border of the last sub-menu item in the navigation to zero at www.omnitek.tv?  I've got some css: .sf-menu li li.last a {border:0px;} but it's not being applied...
[04:24:32] <bLUEE> xec: works fine since i updated
[04:26:14] <noregret> how i can check if the current element is under a certain class ? e.g. <div main><div key><div action><a link> how can I check if 'link' is under 'main'
[04:27:39] <Already> I'd try it the same way you do for elements. .main > .link
[04:29:06] <termite> noregret: $("linkid").parents("div.main")
[04:29:11] <noregret> Already: i'm not looking for a selector
[04:29:20] <noregret> just a check, true/false
[04:29:37] <termite> $("linkid").parents("div.main").length
[04:29:46] <xec> noregret: you're looping through .link's?
[04:29:58] <noregret> xec: no, it's only one element
[04:30:19] <xec> noregret: why are you not looking for a selecotr
[04:30:22] <xec> selector*
[04:30:52] <termite> noregret: use if ($("linkid").parents("div.main").length){}
[04:31:22] <seutje> isn't closest cheaper
[04:31:24] <seutje> ?
[04:31:38] <xec> why not just $('.main .link').length
[04:31:47] <seutje> yeah
[04:31:54] <seutje> depends on the context, rly
[04:32:49] <noregret> xec: well, i'm inside an event and just want to check if the current element is under that class, so i can do some other stuff
[04:33:14] <xec> noregret: then try $(this).closest(".main").length
[04:33:21] <seutje> if ($(this).closest('.main').length) I'd say
[04:33:36] <noregret> xec: like that, https://pastee.org/5mnxz
[04:33:48] <noregret> i'm takling about "me"
[04:34:18] <xec> right, line 10 looks okay, is it not working?
[04:34:24] <noregret> so i go for me.closest(.class).length ?
[04:34:37] <noregret> xec: i just wrote it, didn't test it yet :)
[04:34:51] <noregret> but if .closest is faster.. i'll go with it
[04:34:53] <noregret> is it faster ?
[04:35:00] <xec> barely, if at all
[04:35:01] <Biomech> I WON IT!!!!
[04:35:17] <Biomech> gay ass IE, I beat you, that's; me 2, IE 1
[04:35:29] <Biomech> and I havent finished yet.... wargarble!
[04:35:56] <xec> noregret: i wouldn't worry about the performance of those two - if there is a noticable difference you have bigger issues with your structure ;)
[04:35:57] <kemza> hi all, i am using google for two days, but i am unable to make my XSS query working. Can anyone help me with?
[04:36:18] <xec> noregret: the difference is that .closest() stops at the first match up the tree
[04:36:33] <noregret> i see
[04:36:41] <xec> noregret: so for a simple check it is slightly better
[04:37:01] <termite> kemza are you doing XSS for testing?
[04:37:48] <kemza> termite: no i need to develop mobile app, which gets data from server
[04:38:16] <chilversc_> kemza: ah, so you're problem is with a CORS request?
[04:39:05] <noregret> hmm, is this correct? $('.spams.index','.keywords.index') the thing is that, whatever is under .spams.index is not selected anymore, but if i removed .keywords.index, it works fine, what could be the reason ?
[04:39:17] <kemza> chilversc_: yes, i am not able to set CORS right
[04:39:40] <noregret> ah wait wait, it's wrong
[04:39:42] <chilversc_> kemza: so is the scenario you have a mobile app served from site A that needs to access 3rd party data from site B?
[04:39:59] <xec> noregret: you're passing two parameters instead of two selectors
[04:40:15] <xec> well, technically they are both selectors but, you get the point ;)
[04:41:14] <noregret> yeh yeah :)
[04:44:31] <lombrozo> does anyone know how to remove the one-pixel horizontal offset between the sub-menu and sub-sub-menu of the primary links at www.omnitek.tv
[04:45:24] <seutje> xec, noregret: actually, turns out parents is faster on chromesies :http://jsperf.com/parents-vs-closest-length
[04:45:50] <kemza> chilversc_: Yes, app will be on phone as app (by phonegap layer) and data on my server. If i set Apache, i can obtain data from server, but without login. If i try to login there i obtain error 401
[04:46:49] <kemza> chilversc_: data on  server have to be password protected
[04:47:48] <xec> seutje: interesting, firefox too
[04:48:05] <seutje> not in all cases though
[04:53:41] <chilversc_> kemza: so the data is on the same domain as the website? then there shouldn't be a problem?
[04:54:43] <kemza>  chilversc_: no data are on other domain. On apache a have set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[04:54:44] <ermajn> hello there...
[04:55:04] <chilversc_> kemza: that needs to be set on the domain the data comes from
[04:55:22] <ermajn> I'm using jquery + jqureymobile... and at some point I can not, for example, change value of input filed... with jquery: $("#element_id").val("bla");
[04:55:31] <ermajn> simply.. through chrome console... this does not work
[04:55:35] <SomeoneWeird> anybody know any good image viewers?
[04:55:40] <SomeoneWeird> (click an image to make it go fullscreen?)
[04:55:45] <ermajn> nothing happened
[04:55:54] <ermajn> can someone help me, I'm getting really frustrated :D
[04:55:57] <kemza> chilversc_: yes on apache a have set  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[04:56:54] <kemza> chilversc_:  it means on server with data service
[04:57:59] <kemza> chilversc_: without login everything work, but a dont have to pass if i set login and password to basic auth
[05:00:20] <noregret> i have a text field, how can i send a return on that field ?
[05:00:30] <chilversc_> kemza: and how do you provide the auth details from the app to the server once you enable auth?
[05:04:39] <kemza> chilversc_:  i am using beforeSend: function (xhr) function with xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', make_base_auth(ausername, apassword));
[05:05:29] <chilversc_> kemza: and that's failing with a 401 error?
[05:07:14] <kemza>  chilversc_: yes, example, with query from server to same server you can see here:  chilversc_:
[05:07:32] <kemza> chilversc_: yes, example, with query from server to same server you can see here: http://www.backlinkbuilding.cz/ajaxtest2.html
[05:09:17] <kemza> chilversc_: clic on button Call Ajax
[05:10:05] <ermajn> nobody?
[05:15:07] <termite> ermajn: so what is the issue?
[05:19:39] <chilversc_> kemza: I must be missing something then, since that example works?
[05:20:52] <mvk> i got a few jQuery.fn.extend({})
[05:20:53] <mvk> s
[05:21:09] <kemza>  chilversc_: Yes, example works, because is on the same server (page ansd service). When i put page to another server or on desktop it do not works.
[05:21:10] <mvk> but after some ajax communication, i cant use .function() anymore
[05:21:21] <mvk> how do i keep my fn.extends alive?
[05:23:18] <kemza> chilversc_: same script on another server http://mercuryvm.notia.cz/ajaxtest2.html
[05:23:22] <mvk> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'selectbox'
[05:23:25] <chilversc_> kemza: ah, seems to be related to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5804366/same-origin-policy-conflicting-with-basic-authentication
[05:26:11] <chilversc_> kemza: also take note of this one (linked from that article) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2054316/jquery-sending-credentials-with-cross-domain-posts
[05:36:00] <bfig> hello, i have a question: if i do $("#someid").click(function()); is there any way inside function to reference the $("#someid") object?
[05:36:46] <chilversc_> kemza: I'd also read through the spec, http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
[05:37:17] <kemza> chilversc_: maybe i am stupid, but none of them woks for me. ok, i look at spec too
[05:37:18] <chilversc_> kemza: note section 6.1, 3 -- "Note: The string "*" cannot be used for a resource that supports credentials"
[05:40:19] <chilversc_> kemza: it looks like the authorization is triggering a pre-flight request http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request
[05:40:38] <chilversc_> kemza: as in my browser the failing (401) request's method is OPTIONS
[05:42:45] <kemza> chilversc_: Ok, now i set in header exactly second server mercuryvm.notia.cz but nothing changes
[05:43:50] <chilversc_> kemza: hmm, see this http://avalanche123.com/blog/2011/10/10/cross-domain-javascript-lessons-learned/
[05:44:21] <chilversc_> kemza: it looks like your 401 should reply with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin and -Credentials headers
[05:45:01] <chilversc_> kemza: hmm, "Chrome prevents basic authentication from a different origin as a phishing attack period. "
[05:45:20] <SeanJM> anyone here have experience using scripted events in svg's?
[05:45:37] <chilversc_> kemza: any chance you can authenticate using something like oauth and an oauth header instead?
[05:47:51] <kemza> chilversc_: i think that no, finally i wilu use as servise mod_plsql with connect to DB, there are authorisation method basic, custom, global and sso. usable for us are only basic
[05:47:59] <chilversc_> kemza: also you're running against this issue, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778548 apparently making this behaviour by design according to the spec
[05:48:46] <ermajn> termite, problem is.. that I can not get to work any jquery function... like val() on input filed
[05:48:49] <chilversc_> it almost seems like you're supposed to accept and respond to the OPTIONS header un-authenticated, which is just silly :s
[05:48:56] <ermajn> I execute it, but nothing happens
[05:49:00] <chilversc_> I'm not sure the spec really handles this very well
[05:49:02] <ermajn> no error, nothing
[05:49:39] <fRAiLtY-> Is there a specific methodology used in jquery I can google for hiding in a sequence. Imagine 5 selects, only 1 shows to start with, then when you've selected the first, the 2nd shows, and so on
[05:49:54] <chilversc_> kemza: again, another similar error to yours http://code.google.com/p/twitter-api/issues/detail?id=2273
[05:52:36] <chilversc_> kemza: yeah, this pretty much confirms it, preflight OPTIONS requests shouldn't require authentication, http://www.kinvey.com/blog/item/61-kinvey-adds-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9103081/send-credentials-in-preflighted-request-cors
[05:53:30] <termite> ermajn: Odd are you sure you are putting in the right id and it's not a duplicate
[05:59:18] <kemza> chilversc_:  Actually, now I do not know what to do...
[06:01:59] <chilversc_> kemza: it looks like the spec is a little hazy here and thus implemenations vary
[06:02:17] <chilversc_> kemza: the main spec seems to suggest that the pre-flight options check always has the authentication removed
[06:03:12] <chilversc_> kemza: but some browsers seem to allow the server to return a 401 with the -Allow-Origin and -Allow-Credentials headers
[06:05:19] <chilversc_> kemza: but it seems like to handle this in the webserver you'd need to go altering the auth modules to handle CORS since the default apache modules don't have any notion of this
[06:05:38] <chilversc_> or not use the auth modules and handle it at the application level
[06:07:47] <beasty> hi guys
[06:07:54] <beasty> anyone here using jquery mobile ?
[06:14:34] <dannNiel> Hi. Does anybody know an calendar like this one, where i can provide a list of events for the month with a link http://tedserbinski.com/jcalendar/index.html#demo
[06:20:36] <noregret> i have a list of elements with the same clasa, how can i trigger the click event for a certain element ? is there a way to pass a param or some sort..
[06:20:56] <johnkpaul> ?trigger @ noregret
[06:21:05] <johnkpaul> damn, no bot
[06:21:15] <johnkpaul> noregret: $jqObj.trigger('click')
[06:21:28] <johnkpaul> will trigger the click event on whatever dom element the $jqObj contains
[06:22:16] <kemza> chilversc_: ok, i hav to try it, thanks for help
[06:24:19] <pachet> noregret: like johnkpaul said, trigger should do what you want
[06:24:24] <noregret> johnkpaul: i have this event https://pastee.org/nk4uc i want to triggger it with a different $(this).text().. not sure if i'm clear..
[06:24:33] <pachet> you can also pass in additional parameters by specifying an array as the second argument
[06:24:50] <pachet> eg $('#foo').trigger('click', ['bar', 2, 'baz'])
[06:25:11] <johnkpaul> noregret: $("#keywordlist .keyword").eq(whateverIndexYouWant).trigegr('click')
[06:25:22] <johnkpaul> trigger*
[06:27:15] <majd> hey #jquery - using jquery UI, i create a .buttonset() - It looks fine in firefox (and ie!!), but in chrome, one of the radio buttons still appears floating to the left of the buttonset. I can't seem to be able to reproduce the problem in a jsfidde. any thoughts?
[06:27:49] <johnkpaul> majd: probably a css issue on your page
[06:28:03] <johnkpaul> I'd start with removing all of your css files but the jqui one
[06:29:33] <majd> johnkpaul: ok, let me try, 1 min.
[06:30:50] <Guest75034> hi I need some help with the qtip tooltip plugin and ajax post
[06:31:07] <Guest75034> anyone available?
[06:31:52] <xec> ?ask @ Guest75034
[06:32:10] * xec shakes his fist at bot-t
[06:32:36] <xec> Guest75034: "some help" is rather vague - if you post some details maybe someone will know if they are able to help or not ;)
[06:33:06] <Guest75034> yes ok
[06:33:48] <xec> preferable a live demo
[06:33:52] <xec> preferably*
[06:37:22] <Mosselman> Hi all. In the response of an ajax call I want to find out the url of the file that I called. How do I get this url from the response?
[06:37:54] <Guest75034> I'm using the qtip plugin to show a tooltip when a user clicks a button. This button needs to fire an ajax post, on which success I want to fire the qtip tooltip. The show even of the tooltip can be defined, and I want it to fire immediately. So far the closest I've come to is define the show event on 'mousemove'. Here's the pastebin with the code (js snippet + django template file): http://pastebin.com/ye81LGgg
[06:41:15] <Guest75034> so I'm wondering now how to fire the tooltip immediately as a function of the ajax success callback
[06:42:29] <jerzi> anyone available for help with this?
[06:42:32] <johnkpaul> Mosselman: this.url inside the scope of an ajax callback
[06:42:37] <noregret> johnkpaul: i don't want to select an index, i want to run that exact event with a different this if possible, is it doable ?
[06:43:17] <johnkpaul> noregret: what do you want the "different this" to be?
[06:44:24] <noregret> johnkpaul: different 'this', e.g. an element of my choice
[06:44:26] <majd> johnkpaul: i disabled embeded styles, the problem persists!
[06:44:36] <johnkpaul> noregret: "embedded styles"?
[06:44:47] <Mosselman> johnkpaul: I get 'undefined' when I do that :(
[06:44:53] <johnkpaul> noregret: you mean an element that is not of css selector "#keyboardlist .keyword"?
[06:44:57] <Mosselman> I use 'ajax:complete' btw
[06:45:01] <Mosselman> bind
[06:45:15] <noregret> johnkpaul: yeah
[06:45:20] <noregret> johnkpaul: a different one
[06:46:48] <johnkpaul> noregret: callback.call(TheElementYouWant)
[06:46:53] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ Mosselman
[06:47:08] <johnkpaul> majd: "embedded styles"?
[06:47:27] <Mosselman> johnkpaul: Sadly no :(
[06:47:43] <jerzi> can anyone help with the qtip problem?
[06:47:49] <jerzi> listed above
[06:47:51] <Mosselman> bind('ajax:complete', function(vet, xhr, something){ //Want url here  });
[06:47:54] <Mosselman> that is the gist of it
[06:48:27] <majd> johnkpaul: all css that i wrote.
[06:48:38] <johnkpaul> Mosselman: xhr.url?
[07:00:39] <dannNiel> Hi. Is it possible to attach an url when a special day is clicked with datepicker? i need an js calendar, with which it is possible to link different days to a url.
[07:01:18] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/ZAbYj/
[07:01:22] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone assist ^^
[07:01:47] <pachet> dannNiel: since this is #jquery, and because i don't know any other calendar plugins off the top of my head, look at the jquery ui datepicker
[07:02:04] <pachet> it exposes an 'onSelect' event that you can use to trigger actions based on what day is picked
[07:02:25] <dannNiel> pachet: ty
[07:04:33] <pachet> fRAiLtY-: 'checkDate is not defined'
[07:06:50] <fRAiLtY-> pachet:  No because that's a function I  haven't included in the fiddle, I just want to know the correct way of replacing the string with a variable
[07:11:30] <TeraJL> i'm trying to get a json from facebook with $.ajax() but i keep getting this: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : " when it is trying to read the facebook feed: " https://www.facebook.com/feeds/page.php?id=231963346850936&format=json&callback=? ", i'm setting the url and the datatype to "json"
[07:12:30] <ravenzz> jsonp
[07:12:46] <fRAiLtY-> TeraJL:  Did you do any of the coding in jsfiddle? As I often get that when copying and pasting from there
[07:13:33] <TeraJL> ravenzz: facebook doesn't have format=jsonp, and setting the datatype to jsonp gives me the same result
[07:14:18] <TeraJL> fRAiLtY-:  and i didn't use jsfiddle
[07:14:55] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: if you replace all occurences with that selectedText string, it wont get updated if you seleect something else..
[07:15:28] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  So there's a valid reason why it works with the long string and not with the var
[07:15:29] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[07:15:54] <shoky> fRAiLtY-:  you haven't said what "it works" means
[07:16:22] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  It does what I expect it to do, it acts accordingly based on the text() of those items. If I swap it out for a var it doesn't.
[07:16:32] <shoky> right, you're still being very vague
[07:16:39] <shoky> do you expect it to get the updated value or not?
[07:16:55] <shoky> if you select something else..
[07:17:29] <jerzi> http://pastebin.com/ye81LGgg can someone help firing a qtip tooltip immediately after ajax call (fired on button.click() ) ?
[07:17:51] <shoky> cause by replacing those queries with a variable .. you're only querying the DOM once , when first setting the variable
[07:17:54] <jerzi> ajax success call*
[07:19:04] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  Sorry, I'm new to jQuery, I just know that "it does what I expect it to" sorry if that's not much help
[07:19:07] <rakl> I am getting a file back on success of an ajax call, how do I open a window to download it?
[07:19:14] <fRAiLtY-> if I replace the string with a var it doesn't, I'm just trying to understand why
[07:20:05] <shoky> fRAiLtY-:  when you replace it with a var, you're not re-querying the DOM each time. so if the selected option changes, you'll still be referencing the old one
[07:20:48] <shoky> fRAiLtY-:  jQuery(this).find('option:selected')    means query the DOM for the current selected option
[07:20:53] <fRAiLtY-> So is there any way to "tidy it up"
[07:21:01] <fRAiLtY-> or shorten it somehow
[07:21:33] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: for a start you could put that selectedVar in each of the callbacks you're using it in
[07:22:29] <shoky> wait
[07:22:59] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: what did jQuery(this) even mean  when it was at the top.. not  inside any callback
[07:23:22] <fRAiLtY-> Sorry I don't understand :x
[07:24:02] <shoky> anyway, this is what i meant: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ZAbYj/1/
[07:24:58] <shoky> it only makes sense to refer to 'this' inside a function where you know what 'this' refers to
[07:28:00] <nFFF> guys how do I get, the all elements upto and including '#here'? $('p').nextUntil('#here'); doesn't cinlude '#here'
[07:30:38] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i want to loop vertically through a table , how can i do that?
[07:30:39] <shoky> nFFF: .nextUntil('#here').add('#here')  would work
[07:31:38] <fRAiLtY-> Grr that causes a illegal token, damn jsfiddle!
[07:31:38] <shoky> i suppose also .nextUntil('#here + *') or something. but that's gross
[07:31:46] <TeraJL> can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/joaolvcm/pqghg/ ?
[07:31:56] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: it's probably just one character at the end of the fiddle
[07:32:29] <nFFF> shoky, yea was using add, wasnt sure if there was an easier method
[07:36:19] <emiltin> hi, why would $.ajax user the request type OPTIONS, even though i specify type: GET? https://gist.github.com/3788346
[07:37:01] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  Is this the "right" way of saying if text is None and the previous option is Supplying files thenâ€¦  else if (selectedText == 'None ' && selectedArtwork.selectedText == 'Supplying print-ready files! ')
[07:38:30] <shoky> fRAiLtY-:  why would selectedArtwork have a selectedText property ?
[07:39:36] <shoky> also what does selectedArwork have to do with the "previous option"
[07:41:08] <fRAiLtY-> nm done it
[07:41:16] <fRAiLtY-> selectedArtwork.find('option:selected').text()
[07:41:18] <fRAiLtY-> seems towork
[07:42:09] <fRAiLtY-> shaky, If I tried to explain it I'd probably cry. Think of the worlds most complicated date/time system with a million different caveats and what-ifs, times it by 100 and you've got the system we work to here
[07:43:38] <shoky> emiltin:  $.ajax('http://geo.oiorest.dk/adresser.json', { type: 'GET', dataType: 'json', data: options, success: function(..){..} } )
[07:45:27] <emiltin> shoky: thanks. what's the substantial difference?
[07:46:21] <shoky> emiltin:  sorry i misread your coffeescript, thought it was wrong
[07:47:25] <emiltin> shoky: compiled js seems to be same as your suggestion :-)
[07:49:39] <shoky> emiltin: yea, no idea..
[07:49:57] <jerzi> can someone help with this: http://pastebin.com/ye81LGgg
[07:50:43] <BarisW> How can I trigger all elements with a given class, but only when they are not in the container #item-list?
[07:51:13] <timing> by irccloud
[07:51:16] <timing> bye
[07:51:26] <timing> Nice: http://connectionresetbypeer.net
[07:51:42] <BarisW> I tried $('div:not(#item-list) .my-element'), but that didn't work
[07:53:03] <timing> BarisW: can I see your html somewhere?
[07:53:18] <timing> *we
[07:53:21] <BarisW> do you need the html or the js?
[07:53:24] <jerzi> Is it possible to register a click event twice?
[07:54:08] <jerzi> like $('#button').click(doSomething).click(doSomethingElseAsWell); ?
[07:55:20] <BarisW> timing: here's the html: https://gist.github.com/20e8085db1dcc170d7ec
[07:55:56] <BarisW> I want to reach all .lexicon-term items, but only when NOT in this list
[07:56:22] <BarisW> (i open a pop-up with the explanation of the term, does not make sense in the explanation list ;))
[07:56:55] <grifx_> Hellol
[07:58:08] <Krambiorix> hi , i get a syntax error on :nth ---> $("#fbusers > tr:nth-child("+i+")");
[07:58:13] <Krambiorix> what can be the problem?
[07:58:44] <grifx_> I've an ajax form. I want to send the request in ajax 3 seconds after the last change. but if the user change a value in this 3 seconds, the countdown have to be update at 3s
[07:59:00] <BarisW> timing: Already fixed it, thanks for the help offer
[07:59:35] <timing> BarisW: and if you just get all .lexicon-term and then later do $(el).closest('#notinlist').length == 0 //
[07:59:42] <timing> BarryCarlyon:  ok :-)
[07:59:45] <timing> FUCK
[08:00:53] <Krambiorix> anyone? i get a syntax error on :nth ---> $("#fbusers > tr:nth-child("+i+")");
[08:02:35] <timing> eq ?
[08:03:22] <timing> Krambiorix: I meant to highlight you can you try :eq() ?
[08:04:03] <Krambiorix> timing, for you i will try that my friend
[08:04:35] <anli_> How do I create a function callable like this $.foo();?
[08:04:42] <anli_> Do I just $.foo = function(){} ?
[08:05:14] <jastor> $.fn.foo = function () iirc but im not sure
[08:05:25] <anli_> But that will create a method, will it not?
[08:05:25] * jastor is high on morphine right now and a bit slow
[08:05:38] <gabriel> thats the stuff!
[08:05:42] <gabriel> ;)
[08:05:50] <Krambiorix> timing, you're the man, that works!
[08:05:52] <jastor> gabriel: yup .. gotta love the hospitals
[08:06:53] <jastor> anli_: not to sound like a douche but more like a source , there is a guide on jquery.com to writing plugins
[08:06:58] <Krambiorix> one last question: i try to get the background color of a td with td.css("backgroundColor")  but this gives me undefined...
[08:07:05] <anli_> Ah, you sounded just like that ;)
[08:07:06] <Krambiorix> is this the right way to do it?
[08:07:31] <jastor> anli_: i was afraid to sound like another "rtfm you bastard" ;)
[08:09:58] <anli_> jastor: hehe
[08:10:11] <anli_> jastor: I did my function just like $.foo = function(), not very surprising
[08:10:20] <emiltin> shoky: shoky: this works https://gist.github.com/3788346. using jsonp as datatype changed request type to GET. had to set cache: true to avoid timestamp, which causes server to bark
[08:10:43] <Krambiorix> anyone?
[08:11:57] <jastor> anli_: yea .. $fn.foo  is more for $(selector).foo(whatever);
[08:24:21] <mowol> why is this wrong: $('#text').val($('#stil option[value='$('#stil').val()']').html()); ?
[08:25:11] <quicksilver> because 'foo'bar'baz' isn't valid javascript
[08:25:18] <quicksilver> you have to concatenat your strings
[08:25:24] <quicksilver> 'foo' + bar + 'baz'
[08:25:48] <quicksilver> '#stil option[value=' + $('#stil').val() + ']' in your case.
[08:26:34] <mowol> ofcourse, rookie mistake. Thanks :)
[08:26:47] <quicksilver> yw.
[08:26:52] <quicksilver> spaces only added for clarity.
[08:26:56] <quicksilver> but they look nicer to me
[08:27:26] <mowol> agreed
[08:28:56] <Whirl3d> Good day #jquery.
[08:29:08] <xec> evening, Whirl3d :)
[08:29:27] <Whirl3d> aha! I stand corrected...how's things?
[08:29:47] <xec> things are good!
[08:30:19] <Whirl3d> Right on! Glad to hear it. Anything new and exciting with jquery I should know about?
[08:30:22] <xec> at least they are things - and things is better than no things
[08:30:37] <Whirl3d> good point
[08:31:24] <Krambiorix> can someone help me with this shit? http://pastebin.com/riD5ZCeV
[08:32:58] <Whirl3d> Krambiorix, what are you trying to accomplish?
[08:33:35] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, i try to loop vertically through a table and get the background color of each table cell
[08:34:05] <Whirl3d> Krambiorix, at first glance (and I'm rusty at all this), it appears that you might want to use $("#fbtable".find("tr").length rather than .index() on line 3....maybe?
[08:34:47] <jastor> $("#fbtable tr").each( mayby ?
[08:35:57] <Whirl3d> basically, replacing index with length?  Because .find("tr").index() is always going to give you the first tr index which is 0, I believe. So it will skip the look. Whereas .length will loop through each tr. Or something like jastor said would be better.
[08:36:11] <Whirl3d> *loop
[08:37:29] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, yes
[08:37:41] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d,  but still, everything is undefined
[08:37:59] <Whirl3d> and just as a point of preference, it is probably best not to use reserved words like "color" as a variable name....even bcolor would be better... (sidenote)
[08:38:33] <Whirl3d> what is the number 24 in your first loop?
[08:38:34] <jastor> each(fucnition()  {  bg = $(this).css("background"); } );
[08:38:59] <jastor> or do a each against if it was the tds you wanted
[08:39:02] <Pessimism> I added a callback query to this (http://jsfiddle.net/MXv3Z/) JS code to fix the SOP error, but now my GET requests fail: http://jsfiddle.net/jjrZW/. What am I doing wrong? I included some console logging
[08:39:17] <jastor> $(this).find("td").each(function {} );
[08:40:36] <Krambiorix> jastor, i don't want to loop through the td's
[08:41:14] <jastor> Krambiorix: i said "if" it was the tds you wanted ;)
[08:41:18] <grifx_> My js change the value of an input
[08:41:47] <grifx_> but the event change isn't triggered
[08:41:51] <sypris> Hey guys, I have a unique issue.  I'm trying to use a .click on a button inside a data-content tag.  If it's inside, jquery doesn't know it exists, but if I use the button standalone it works fine.   Here's the html http://pastebin.com/t5Ze6Q5S
[08:41:52] <Whirl3d> and you may want to check the best way to evaluate backgroundColor...it might need the hyphenated syntax: "background-color"
[08:42:24] <Krambiorix> jastor , ow ok
[08:42:32] <Whirl3d> Krambiorix, either way, jsfiddle is going to be a much easier way to test this. Copy and paste your content to a new fiddle and paste the url here...
[08:42:38] <Krambiorix> jastor, Whirl3d i have this now but doesn't work as it should http://pastebin.com/hsKDAVEs
[08:43:50] <jastor> kraft: change 9 to : $(this).find("td").eq(j)
[08:44:00] <sypris> forgot the jquery code :) http://pastebin.com/4AfTE2xG
[08:44:29] <Whirl3d> Pessimism, I wish I could help you, but that's beyond my scope having just returned from no jquery for a couple of months.
[08:44:49] <jastor> Krambiorix* i mean
[08:45:04] <Pessimism> Whirl3d: I know how you feel. The last time I did anything in jQuery must be years ago
[08:46:04] <jastor> Krambiorix: line 11 change innerHTML to html()
[08:47:05] <Pessimism> Whirl3d: I think I know what it is. The return data with AJAX is an array, while the JSON obviously isn't. Thus, I can't use [i] to iterate over the data structure
[08:47:07] <Krambiorix> jastor, great!!!!
[08:47:19] <Krambiorix> jastor it works!
[08:47:37] <jastor> Krambiorix: of course it works ;)
[08:47:48] <Krambiorix> haha
[08:48:01] <Krambiorix> jastor, Whirl3d thanks for your splendid help!
[08:48:26] <jastor> Krambiorix: no prob
[08:50:21] <jastor> sypris: you forgot an s
[08:50:41] <jastor> the class says return_links  but the selector says .return_link
[08:51:55] <jastor> sypris: unless you mean the <button> inside data-control  btu thats not part of the dom so ofcourse not jquery doenst find it .. so you have to make it part of it firt before you can bind it to a click event
[08:52:31] <sypris> the 2 classes are different...and how do I make it apart of the DOM?
[08:53:00] <sypris> could I just call those buttons in a div and hide it?
[08:54:06] <jastor> sypris: $(".return_links").each(function() {  button = $(this).attr("data-content"); } );   and then append(button) to where you want it .. then bind
[08:56:06] <dogarrhea2_> are there any significant issues with ajax on mobile devices?
[08:56:42] <jastor> dogarrhea2_: not that i have stumbled upon using jquery/jquerymobile .. but i have only tested android and iphone
[08:58:11] <pixeltarian> do I have to wrap the content of every LI element in some other tage in order to target a style change for just that LI instead of the entire UL?
[08:58:15] <pixeltarian> examples....
[08:58:20] <dogarrhea2> i know there's a
[08:58:27] <pixeltarian> work the way I want: http://jsfiddle.net/XztuZ/
[08:58:38] <dogarrhea2> i know there's a @#$%load of presentational bugs on ombile
[08:58:45] <dogarrhea2> it's like we're back in the early 90s
[08:59:11] <dogarrhea2> except instead of IE netscape bugs, it's android ios
[08:59:26] <pixeltarian> no work the way I want, but i want to target the li instead of having to target h2: http://jsfiddle.net/7bLwg/
[08:59:27] <dogarrhea2> with Google clearly playing the role of microsoft.
[09:00:12] <pixeltarian> (or maybe this is more of a css selector question than a jquery questoin...)
[09:02:27] <dogarrhea2> when a sound is played and android doesn't fire the "finished" event , what's the workaround?
[09:03:04] <manuell> hi
[09:03:05] <mowol> can i inside a string concatenation do a "short-form" if like in php?
[09:04:43] <pixeltarian> in other words, why does this change the BG color of the entire UL instead of just the LI?:  http://jsfiddle.net/7bLwg/
[09:05:27] <Brodingo> pixeltarian take out .parent()
[09:07:34] <pixeltarian> oh thank you! thant worked. so .parent() effects the element one level above the current element?
[09:07:40] <pixeltarian> (that's sort of a wild guess)
[09:08:57] <krasslex> hello
[09:09:48] <pixeltarian> I think I'm correct though. (reading through the API).
[09:10:12] <krasslex> can anyone help me with a beginner problem?
[09:10:23] <pixeltarian> for posterity ( http://api.jquery.com/parent/ )
[09:10:37] <manuell> just ask, krasslex
[09:10:39] <pixeltarian> krasslex: just ask
[09:10:45] <krasslex> thx
[09:11:38] <krasslex> i try to assign the chosen class to a select, with is added by ajax
[09:11:48] <krasslex> should i post the code here?
[09:11:53] <pixeltarian> no
[09:11:54] <termite> ?demo
[09:11:55] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:12:07] <manuell> ^^
[09:12:26] <krasslex> ok, this will take i time... i try to to this, thx so far
[09:12:43] <pixeltarian> or link your site
[09:13:03] <pixeltarian> reading the channel topic stuff is a good idea.
[09:14:11] <pixeltarian> it will get you help faster
[09:15:21] <pixeltarian> and will keep some of the grouchy people off your back if you're following protocol
[09:15:40] <callumacrae> Shameless promotion, but I am fairly helpful in here so oh well: My book (JavaScript from jQuery) is half price today as O'Reilly's Deal of the Day: http://oreil.ly/SkIsa7
[09:16:14] <quicksilver> awesome
[09:16:20] * quicksilver <3 the shamelessness :)
[09:16:29] <callumacrae> Shameless self-promotion*
[09:16:36] <pixeltarian> whaaaaaa...
[09:16:44] <pixeltarian> is that how to learn javascript if you know jquery first?
[09:16:55] <callumacrae> Yup
[09:17:05] <pixeltarian> I'm sure it's great, but that concept freaks my brain out
[09:17:10] <callumacrae> Well, you don't really "know" jQuery until you know JS
[09:17:11] <manuell> lol
[09:17:40] <pixeltarian> I didn't understand anything about jquery until I did some JS
[09:17:52] <pixeltarian> that could just be my learning style
[09:18:07] <pixeltarian> I need to know why a semicolon is there before I remember to use it
[09:18:12] <pixeltarian> and such.
[09:18:38] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/UFxKu/ any ideas why its not grabbing both paragraphs?
[09:18:40] <manuell> i learn from the top to the bottom
[09:18:59] <pixeltarian> I'm reading javascript: the good parts at the moment
[09:19:27] <pixeltarian> and and "beginning javascript with dom scripting and ajax"
[09:19:32] <manuell> from $.ajax({... to alert(); :-)
[09:19:40] <callumacrae> Read the first one, that one is good
[09:19:45] <callumacrae> I'm not really a Crockford fan, though
[09:19:46] <pixeltarian> (which i hope is still semantically relavant)
[09:19:58] <johnkpaul> callumacrae: for a beginner?
[09:20:04] <johnkpaul> I don't know if good parts is a good book for a beginner
[09:20:08] <johnkpaul> ?learn @ pixeltarian
[09:20:09] <bot-t> pixeltarian, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:20:16] <johnkpaul> ?eloquent
[09:20:18] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Neue Links by jensgro · Pull Request #10 · SirPepe - GitHub - https://github.com/SirPepe/HTML5Resources/pull/10
[09:20:19] <callumacrae> The Good Parts is *not* a good book for a beginner
[09:20:20] <pixeltarian> yeah, I'm learning JS atm
[09:20:28] <johnkpaul> pixeltarian: look into the book eloquent javascript
[09:20:30] <pixeltarian> codeacademy is pretty good thus far
[09:20:30] <johnkpaul> it's free online
[09:20:40] <manuell> "Neue" ?
[09:20:46] <johnkpaul> yeah, codeacademy is good as well, if you have other pgoramming experience
[09:20:54] <johnkpaul> manuell: idk what bot-t's talking about
[09:21:16] <johnkpaul> nFFF: because you call first()
[09:21:18] <manuell> Neue is german, means: new links..
[09:21:19] <pixeltarian> codeacademy is the only thing that has made sense to me thus far.
[09:21:28] <pixeltarian> cause they get into the nitty gritty and take it slow
[09:21:43] <johnkpaul> nFFF: next until only has the one pagraph tag in between
[09:21:48] <johnkpaul> nextUntil doesn't include itself
[09:21:56] <johnkpaul> maybe you want nextUntil('ul').andSElf()
[09:22:17] <nFFF> ah thakns
[09:22:21] <nFFF> didnt know that method exists
[09:22:36] <pixeltarian> I haven't programmed much but I get it. and leatst OOP type of stuff  makes sense to me. it's basically logic statements.
[09:22:47] <pixeltarian> with some curly braces
[09:23:16] <pixeltarian> I made my first program an hour after going on ca
[09:25:09] <pixeltarian> I think the fastest way to learn is to apply the stuff to something creative after learning the examples
[09:28:07] <pixeltarian> what's the most minimal and simple way to store some input on the server side?
[09:28:16] <pixeltarian> I'm trying to stay 100% JS
[09:28:25] <NodeX> not possible in pure js
[09:28:32] <pixeltarian> and don't want to use mysql
[09:28:35] <NodeX> unless you pass it to node.js or somehting
[09:28:40] <pixeltarian> js can't write and read?
[09:28:44] <NodeX> no
[09:28:57] <NodeX> Javascript is a "client" (on your browser) language
[09:29:12] <NodeX> unless you use somehting like node.js on the sevrer side and post it to that
[09:29:28] <pixeltarian> gotcha
[09:29:32] <pixeltarian> I found this: http://www.taffydb.com/
[09:29:42] <manuell> but you can run javascript also server-side
[09:29:44] <pixeltarian> but haven't looked at exactly how it works
[09:29:50] <besada> i love jquery :)
[09:30:01] <NodeX> [17:29:38] <manuell> but you can run javascript also server-side ...............[17:29:08] <NodeX> unless you use somehting like node.js on the sevrer side and post it to that
[09:30:17] <manuell> ups, sry :)
[09:30:32] <besada> i never wrote javascript before
[09:31:03] <pixeltarian> i'm thinking it's probably a bad idea to try and jump into node.js when I'm just starting to learn JS/Jquery?
[09:31:15] <pixeltarian> I love javascript
[09:31:26] <pixeltarian> I feel lazy every time I use jquery
[09:31:33] <pixeltarian> (no offence, jquery)
[09:31:34] <manuell> lol
[09:32:15] <xec_> well, the mantra is "write less" so i guess lazy is a good description :)
[09:32:32] <termite> non taken I feel lazy when I use C instead of assembly
[09:33:31] <termite> but you do get more done
[09:35:53] <johnkpaul> pixeltarian: depends on what you background is imho
[09:35:59] <johnkpaul> if you're typically a systems or server side guy
[09:36:03] <johnkpaul> then learn nodejs, it'll be easier
[09:38:25] <pixeltarian> i'm just a designerish html/css guy
[09:38:54] <pixeltarian> front end developer who doesn't know JS
[09:39:05] <johnkpaul> ah ok, so then yes, jquery is good
[09:39:30] <pixeltarian> like a font end eunuch
[09:39:36] <callumacrae> If you're a front-end developer, then why learn Node? xD
[09:40:22] <pachet> for fun and profit
[09:40:25] <ajpiano> http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023258.do
[09:40:54] <callumacrae> I've got that book somewhere
[09:40:55] <pixeltarian> wow. node really took off fast
[09:41:03] <pachet> x for y developers
[09:41:08] <pixeltarian> I feel like I was just watching "look at this brand new thing called node.js" videos
[09:41:15] <b1lly> does jquery .css('left', myNum);     auto append 'px' to myNum?
[09:41:26] <callumacrae> b1lly: Yes
[09:41:33] <b1lly> cool
[09:41:36] <johnkpaul> callumacrae: because it's always good to learn more
[09:41:38] <johnkpaul> that's a very good book
[09:41:42] <pixeltarian> doesn't css appendpx to numbers?
[09:41:46] <johnkpaul> addresses learning node using the background you already have
[09:41:48] <johnkpaul> in front end development
[09:41:52] <pachet> unless myNum is actually a string containing an alternate measure :[
[09:41:52] <callumacrae> pixeltarian: Yeah, but it's bad practice
[09:42:15] <pixeltarian> so putting px there is the best practice?
[09:42:15] <callumacrae> johnkpaul: Fair enough. I'm a front-end developer who knows Node.js, by the way
[09:42:26] <callumacrae> But I came from PHP -> Node.js -> jQuery -> JavaScript
[09:42:27] <pachet> pixeltarian: no :[
[09:42:30] <pachet> that would be such a headache
[09:42:42] <callumacrae> pixeltarian: In CSS, yes. In jQuery, not really
[09:42:59] <pixeltarian> weird. I feel naughty now. I've been not putting px on anything
[09:43:08] <pachet> :o
[09:43:09] <pixeltarian> I thought it was the new shorthand awesome thing to do or something.
[09:45:25] <callumacrae> I dunno, I've always been told that it is bad practice
[10:01:10] <barraponto> css doesn't assume pixels, does it?
[10:02:42] <MistuhKurtz> barraponto, CSS or JS?
[10:03:11] <MistuhKurtz> in your stylesheet, no. with js returning a dimension, it's usually an integer (assumes px)
[10:03:28] <Whirl3d> Could someone please look at this fiddle and tell me why I can't get the buttons to register click events? It's probably something stupid. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/LwAnW/43/
[10:03:34] <MistuhKurtz> but some jquery methods return the css value (20px, 20%, etc)
[10:04:02] <barraponto> MistuhKurtz: yeah
[10:04:40] <MistuhKurtz> Whirl3d, .imageInner has a higher z-index
[10:04:44] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I think it's because something is over the button
[10:04:51] <johnkpaul> yeah ^that
[10:04:56] <Whirl3d> higher than 999
[10:05:07] <Whirl3d> really?  thanks. I'll look into that
[10:05:18] <MistuhKurtz> Whirl3d, that's not the problem
[10:05:29] <MistuhKurtz> z-index doesn't work without position
[10:05:38] <MistuhKurtz> add position:relative; to the button styles and you're good :)
[10:05:54] <Whirl3d> You rock. I didn't know that about zIndex. THanks tons!
[10:06:41] <MistuhKurtz> np
[10:06:58] <Whirl3d> wow. Works like a charm. Thanks again.
[10:08:07] <macmartine> How do I get elements with one class but not another? This is what I'm trying: jQueryEg('.header').on "click", ".services-tab :not(hasClass('disabled')"
[10:08:53] <MistuhKurtz> macmartine, :not(.disabled)
[10:09:09] <macmartine> MistuhKurtz: doesn't work
[10:09:16] <MistuhKurtz> .services-tab:not(disabled)
[10:09:26] <MistuhKurtz> er .disabled
[10:09:43] <macmartine> MistuhKurtz: Ah, got it. thanks!@
[10:09:50] <MistuhKurtz> np
[10:17:06] <bigLanky> arielserafini you around today?
[10:17:16] <arielserafini> bigLanky, sure am
[10:17:18] <arielserafini> :)
[10:17:21] <bigLanky> great
[10:17:29] <bigLanky> still have some time to help me with this slider?
[10:17:39] <arielserafini> yup
[10:18:12] <arielserafini> bigLanky, is the text supposed to be off to the side like that?
[10:18:24] <arielserafini> seems like it should be centered
[10:18:27] <bigLanky> like what?
[10:18:34] <bigLanky> on the site now?
[10:18:37] <arielserafini> yeah
[10:18:41] <arielserafini> http://dwight.team4.ciplex.com/ this one right?
[10:18:52] <bigLanky> yeah
[10:19:06] <bigLanky> the text is getting replaced with an image, but the image needs to fade in and out
[10:19:19] <bigLanky> being off center is just a css issue.. can fix that later
[10:20:57] <arielserafini> kk
[10:21:16] <bigLanky> can we make it work with this slider i am usign now? or should i implement a new one
[10:23:00] <arielserafini> bigLanky, one sec
[10:23:05] <bigLanky> k
[10:25:27] <bigLanky> just to refresh your memory on requirements, I need to load the 5 menu items and have them shift 1 position left or right when the arrows are clicked. also, the menu items need to wrap on the ends. there will be an image that i will position with css that will fade in and out that is associated with the center (active) menu item
[10:28:41] <Douilspee> hi, i'm low with js, can anyone help me optimise this small list / micro carrousel : http://jsfiddle.net/B69Jz/4/
[10:29:13] <Douilspee> specially with firstitem var
[10:32:00] <noregret> https://pastee.org/nk4uc i want to trigger that event but with a different $(this), is it possible ?
[10:34:54] <manuell> noregret different w = $(this) ?
[10:40:29] <noregret> manuell: yeah, something like that
[10:51:49] <manuell> noregret: try $(#your-element), or .your-element
[10:52:22] <ravenzz> noregret I don't know why would you do that, but you can use call()
[10:53:53] <ravenzz> noregret http://jsfiddle.net/TKLMu/
[10:55:38] <noregret> ravenzz: i have an anchor(s)[.keyword, which is basically a text word] that use that event to post some ajax requests, now i want to trigger that event somewhere else with another word, and without me writing the same event code, not sure if this clear..
[10:56:28] <ravenzz> not that much
[10:57:01] <ravenzz> but take a look at the fiddle, do you want something like that?
[10:57:22] <arielserafini> bigLanky, take a look at this: http://www.clubsocial.com.br/como-participar
[10:57:47] <arielserafini> click on the arrows
[10:57:51] <bigLanky> yeah
[10:57:51] <arielserafini> or the titles
[10:57:59] <bigLanky> i need the items to shift
[10:58:08] <bigLanky> kind of like how it is on the current site, but with wrapping
[10:59:56] <bigLanky> anyone up for creating a custom slider with jquery? it is for my company and we can pay. i have been trying to figure this out for weeks and just need it wrapped up. this is the last piece holding us up for this client
[10:59:58] <rumproast> hey.. i got a resizing problem via css and jquery
[11:01:21] <rumproast> i have divs in a column with varying heights, and i'm setting them to resize to match the tallest div within the container.. using
[11:01:21] <rumproast> 	x = (this.height( Math.max.apply(this, $.map( this , function(e){ return $(e).height() }) ) ));
[11:01:33] <arielserafini> bigLanky, something is wrong with that code
[11:01:35] <rumproast> x returns the maxHeight
[11:01:35] <arielserafini> on your page
[11:01:42] <arielserafini> it's generating tons of errors
[11:01:49] <bigLanky> it doesn't matter
[11:01:52] <bigLanky> this slider won't work for what i need
[11:01:55] <arielserafini> something to do with autoPlay
[11:01:58] <bigLanky> im not planning on using this slider
[11:01:59] <bigLanky> hmm
[11:01:59] <rumproast> to apply, i use $('.columns').each(function(){ $('.col',this).height($(this).setAllToMaxHeight()); });
[11:02:02] <bigLanky> let me turn autoplay off
[11:02:11] <bigLanky> i really need a new slider
[11:02:14] <bigLanky> totally custom option
[11:02:20] <bigLanky> ive tried finding other sliders and modifying, but can't do it
[11:02:33] <bigLanky> is there a jquery freelance website i can go to to pay someone to do this?
[11:02:34] <rumproast> each div (class="col") inside the container (class="columns").. resizes properly
[11:02:50] <arielserafini> bigLanky, I just showed you one
[11:02:57] <arielserafini> you think that's not close to what you need?
[11:03:03] <bigLanky> no
[11:03:22] <bigLanky> well, kinda
[11:03:37] <bigLanky> the 3 links need to move so the middle item is always the active item
[11:03:45] <rumproast> now initially it works.. when sizing up within the window.. however if you restore your window out of maximize, it doesn't adjust the divs proportionately
[11:04:09] <Cryp71c> Is it possible to do something like $(this, '#someID')... ?
[11:04:11] <bigLanky> so initially, the 3 buttons are in the order of 1-2-3. when you click the right arrow, the order would change to 2-3-1
[11:04:22] <Cryp71c> I don't get errors when I try to do it, but it doesn't seem to work either.
[11:04:55] <arielserafini> bigLanky, ah, gotcha
[11:05:00] <bigLanky> if its possible to get those 3 buttons to move position that would be perfect
[11:05:04] <bigLanky> know any other examples?
[11:05:20] <arielserafini> bigLanky, I made that one, will try to make it work the way you want
[11:05:22] <rumproast> http://pastebin.com/0gVREqRm
[11:05:26] <bigLanky> jcarousel works pretty good, but if you have 5 items, and you try to go to the 6th item, you would think it would load the first item
[11:05:32] <bigLanky> which it does, but it creates a new <li>
[11:05:53] <bigLanky> great thanks
[11:06:03] <arielserafini> you want it to move the first LI to the end?
[11:06:14] <bigLanky> it needs to loop
[11:07:38] <bigLanky> ideally you would think that there would be <li class="1">...<li class="5"><li class="1"><li class="2"> and so on , but jcarousel makes <li class="1">...<li class="5"><li class="6"><li class="7"> etc
[11:08:35] <bigLanky> i have to run out for a meeting for a bit, but i will be back
[11:08:40] <arielserafini> bigLanky, okay
[11:08:55] <bigLanky> i just really need to get this done
[11:09:07] <bigLanky> this has pushed site launch back 2 weeks at this point... ready to be done with it lol
[11:09:36] <freeed> Hey guysâ€¦ how can I set a callback function to fire when an element is created in the dom? E.g. some other script on a website creates some elements, I want to have a function fire once those elements have been created (without touching the other persons script). Any ideas? Thanks!
[11:10:14] <rumproast> event listener on createElement function maybe?
[11:11:14] <MistuhKurtz> is this plugin's refresh() method exposed as a public method? https://github.com/markdalgleish/stellar.js/blob/master/jquery.stellar.js
[11:11:32] <freeed> rumproast, I don't have access to the other script that creates the element.. just found this that might work - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3900151/is-there-a-jquery-event-that-fires-when-a-new-node-is-inserted-into-the-dom
[11:12:53] <MistuhKurtz> I know it has the Plugin() function exposed as Stellar(), and it extends Plugin() with the Refresh() method
[11:12:58] <rumproast> the createElement would be within the DOM... it wouldnt need access to the other script
[11:13:27] <ajpiano> MistuhKurtz: it looks like it would be on the instance
[11:13:46] <NoiseEee> sup yom kip
[11:13:50] <ajpiano> $("#somElem").data("plugin_stellar").refresh()
[11:13:55] <MistuhKurtz> ah
[11:14:06] <MistuhKurtz> ajpiano, and if the plugin is called without a selector?
[11:14:28] <ajpiano> var foo = new Stellar();  foo.refresh() ostensibly
[11:15:30] <rumproast> freeed - the createElement would be within the DOM... it wouldnt need access to the other script
[11:15:35] <rumproast> but once createElement is executed, ur event Listener should fire off with whatever you programmed it
[11:16:09] <freeed> ahhhh.. I got ya rumproast, I'll start googling how to tap into that
[11:16:13] <freeed> Thanks!
[11:21:19] <MistuhKurtz> hm getting close ajpiano
[11:21:48] <ajpiano> MistuhKurtz: i've never seen the plugin before. diddn't look to me immediately as though it could be called without being on a partic element
[11:21:50] <ajpiano> but iunno
[11:24:02] <MistuhKurtz> ajpiano, you were right that var foo = new Stellar(); foo.refresh(); works
[11:24:19] <MistuhKurtz> but obv. it's a new instance, I need to figure out how to call it on the instance that I already have
[11:24:35] <MistuhKurtz> i.e. $(el).data('plugin_stellar').refresh(); or something like that
[11:24:38] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to modify a script directly in browser on page load?
[11:24:48] <dogarrhea2> i'm trying to inject some code into a function on firebug
[11:29:50] <Whirl3d> dogarrhea2, you mean like Grease Monkey or something?
[11:30:11] <dogarrhea2> more than grease monkey
[11:30:31] <dogarrhea2> there's a defined prototype. i want to put a console.log inside the definition of the function
[11:31:23] <Whirl3d> can't you just extend the prototype with your own console.log and substititute?
[11:32:19] <Whirl3d> Doh! Wait. you want to log at a specific point during instantiation,  not just upon instantion...sorry...
[11:34:29] <rumproast> http://www.jacobcruz.net/layout1.html
[11:34:37] <rumproast> having a jquery/css issue
[11:34:43] <rumproast> initially, it sets the heights of the divs in each column appropriately, but when you restore the window out of maximize (effectively downsizing the window), the div columns get cropped out from an overflow:hidden..
[11:35:03] <rumproast> if ur window is maximized, and you 'restore' the window (downsizing it), the column divs get cropped out
[11:35:07] <Krambiorix> i build a table and attach the on click event to every cell. But when i add a new row with jquery all on click events from the rows above are gone... Is this normal??
[11:35:14] <rumproast> it doesnt output any error
[11:35:21] <MistuhKurtz> ajpiano, $("#scrollWrapper").data('plugin_stellar').refresh(); works for accessing the instance
[11:35:23] <rumproast> of course in the downsized window, if you refresh -> it'll set the div heights... (because it can do it right the first time)
[11:35:34] <rumproast> anyone see what im talkin about?
[11:36:37] <Whirl3d> Krambiorix, there is a much better way to handle click events on cells using the .on handler that will not be broken when you add cells.
[11:37:32] <Whirl3d> Krambiorix, inside the handler function, you can reference the item that triggered the event. So one .on handler will handle them all...whether they are added previously or in the future.
[11:37:36] <manuell> rumproast, no :)
[11:38:04] <manuell> the layout looks stable
[11:38:47] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, ok thx it works!
[11:39:38] <MistuhKurtz> ajpiano, haha, derp. $(window).data('plugin_stellar'); works. thanks for your help!!!
[11:39:59] <ajpiano> MistuhKurtz: no prob bob, there ya go!
[11:43:12] <MistuhKurtz> Is it possible to remove a style delcaration set with javascript so that it goes back to going off the stylesheet?
[11:45:21] <MistuhKurtz> $(el).removeAttr('style'); works to remove -all- inline styles
[11:52:11] <rumproast> manuel, did you try resizing the window?
[11:52:26] <rumproast> cus its not showing stable in FF, IE, or Chrome.. on Windows
[11:52:39] <adiii> Hello everyone!! Is there a way to specify default selected tab for the jquery ui in the html so that when tabs is initialized it selects the default tab from markup
[11:53:40] <r1card> guys, I want to animate something that's not CSS. Tips?
[11:59:08] <bil`> hi
[11:59:22] <bil`> whats the correct syntax for doing the inverse of .is(':visible')
[12:00:16] <bil`> if (!$('foo').is(':visible') <--- ?
[12:01:09] <r1card> "Step is called for each element, each property" oh laudy :P
[12:01:22] <r1card> I just want a step function that gives me values from 0 to 1.0
[12:01:27] <r1card> Any tricks?
[12:04:13] <jedimind> bil`, .not
[12:04:15] <jedimind> iirc
[12:04:26] <jedimind> .not(':visible')
[12:04:35] <bil`> makes sense :) thanks
[12:04:38] <ajpiano> nonononnonno
[12:04:39] <ajpiano> omg jedimind
[12:04:40] <ajpiano> arg
[12:04:46] <bil`> no?
[12:04:50] <ajpiano> ?g jquery opposite of is not ajpiano @ bil`
[12:04:52] <bot-t> bil`, The opposite of jQuery's .is() method is not .not() - adam j. sontag - http://ajpiano.com/the-opposite-of-jquerys-is-method-is-not-not-it-is-is/
[12:04:53] <ajpiano> bil`: you had it right
[12:05:04] <jedimind> oh shit
[12:05:06] <jedimind> its not not
[12:05:38] <bil`> the query docs kinda make it seem like either way would work
[12:05:46] <jedimind> yeah, why is it not .not()
[12:05:53] <ajpiano> read the post
[12:05:58] <jedimind> im reading, im slow
[12:06:30] <bil`> "  Because jQueryâ€™s .not() method is a filtering method, it does not return a boolean value."
[12:06:49] <r1card> folks I see conflicting info on animating scroll position
[12:06:57] <r1card> scrollTop is supported as a property I see
[12:07:05] <r1card> but animation is on both html and body. Why?
[12:07:07] <bil`> in any case, thanks for the help guys
[12:16:52] <barraponto> jquery tooltip suggestions?
[12:18:07] <styol> jQuery 1.3.2 (I know, I know): Is mousedown an acceptable event for the live method? IE: .live('mousedown', function(){}); -- I'm unable to get it to work properly, so in the interim I've dirtily defined a function that is called 500ms after the initial and subsequent bind('mousedown', â€¦)'s. Anything less dirty I can use like live or otherwise? I'm guessing 500ms isn't a safe bet at the moment based on network latency / new dom, but yeah
[12:22:03] <velcrobots> 1
[12:23:39] <velcrobots> i have small div (a "back to top" link) that sits on the very bottom of my site.  i use position:fixed to do this.  thing is, I need it inside the confines of my site container (which is 960px wide and centered).  I know CSS "fixed" is always relative to the window.  anything with jquery to do this?  a "sticky" div that always sits in the bottom of another div?
[12:26:11] <shoky> velcrobots: the container needs to be positioned (have non-static css 'position') and the inner "sticky" div needs position:absolute
[12:26:48] <velcrobots> shoky: that won't work on scroll.
[12:27:07] <rgenito_> herro everyone
[12:28:03] <shoky> velcrobots: it will if you scroll an inner div, not the whole contents of the container
[12:28:19] <shoky> well, donno what you're scrolling
[12:28:40] <velcrobots> yeah, it's a real long page
[12:28:50] <velcrobots> i can't go in now and change the structure like that
[12:28:52] <shoky> either way, position:absolute means relative to the offset parent (the closest positioned ancestor)
[12:28:56] <shoky> which is what you want
[12:29:02] <velcrobots> yeah i'm 100% on CSS positioning
[12:29:28] <velcrobots> last minute they threw a "we want a pinterest-style back-to-top button"
[12:29:57] <shoky> what's wrong with a "last-minute-additional-div"
[12:31:01] <rgenito_> http://pastie.org/private/sjvwjonej2vc4ldkflbrpa
[12:31:15] <rgenito_> ^-- how do i get firefox to create my Date object properly?
[12:31:16] <velcrobots> theres no way to make it sticky
[12:31:20] <rgenito_> (that is run on latest firefox)
[12:35:36] <shoky> velcrobots: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5gSmg/
[12:35:54] <velcrobots> shoky: right -
[12:35:55] <velcrobots> but
[12:36:09] <velcrobots> i can't alter the page structure like that at this point.  it's a little beyond my control
[12:36:14] <rgenito_> anyone recommended a good document discussing javascript's "Date"?
[12:36:18] <velcrobots> to put the whole page into a scrolling div
[12:39:21] <shoky> velcrobots: its hard to answer without knowing what your current structure is.. and what's being scrolled
[12:40:27] <velcrobots> shoky: sorry.  i understand that.  i have a drupal site.  i have to work within the constrains of a typical page template when building these one-off special interactive things for this place i work for.
[12:40:46] <velcrobots> so the main page just scrolls like any other web page.  and this one is long
[12:41:20] <shoky> where does the centered site container come in
[12:42:46] <shoky> make a minimal jsfiddle showing the structure you gotta work with, and we can add the code you want
[12:43:00] <shoky> chatting about it wont get us far
[12:56:11] <velcrobots> shoky: ok
[13:01:42] <velcrobots_> shoky: here we go.  i made it simpler and skinner to illustrate.  the "back to top" needs to stay sticky at the bottom, but within the confines of #wrapper: http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/6qrQF/1/
[13:04:01] <rakm> hey, I'm using the .ajax() function and on success getting back content type octet-stream. How do I get the browser to get the returned file to download?

[13:12:28] <kenperkins> anyone know of an objective comparison of templating json into markup vs downloading pre-rendered html snippets
[13:13:06] <iSeeDeadPixels> anyone experience with converting xpath selectors to css selectors?
[13:13:09] <barraponto> kenperkins: subjectively, templating json is fun.
[13:13:15] <kenperkins> fun, of course
[13:13:48] <Eviltwin> iSeeDeadPixels: There's a lot of overlap in functionality: http://ejohn.org/blog/xpath-css-selectors/
[13:14:07] <barraponto> iSeeDeadPixels: python's lxml actually does that.
[13:14:47] <iSeeDeadPixels> html body center table:eq(0) tr:eq(3) td:eq(1) table tr:eq(0) td:eq(0) font isn't working
[13:14:59] <barraponto> kenperkins: i guess json is useful if you need the data (you can template several "views" from data you get out of a single request)
[13:15:11] <iSeeDeadPixels> /html/body/center/table[1]/tr[4]/td[2]/table/tr[1]/td[1]/font is working.
[13:15:16] <kenperkins> oh yea, I know of the basics of it
[13:15:26] <jstepper> hi
[13:15:35] <jstepper> how do i do a delay in jquery
[13:15:36] <kenperkins> i just haven't seen an objective test where it actually measures the impact of downloading markup vs templating it
[13:15:38] <barraponto> kenperkins: as for performance, particularly on mobile devices, it's more about starting a request than it's size.
[13:15:43] <jstepper> this is not for animation
[13:15:57] <jstepper> i mean deplay before calling the next part in javascript
[13:16:11] <kenperkins> that's one of my specific curiosities: is it better to get 100 comments via json, then template, or just get 100 pre-rendered comments in HTML form
[13:16:17] <barraponto> kenperkins: json is as good as it prevents you from doing *more* requests.
[13:16:38] <kenperkins> sure, but i don't have any evidence of the perf impact of that much templating
[13:16:39] <barraponto> kenperkins: otherwise markup is better since it's lighter on js (i think, but i have no objective tests)
[13:17:26] <barraponto> kenperkins: TL;DR i don't know of any objective tests, but if you write any, please share.
[13:17:31] <kenperkins> haha
[13:17:43] <velcrobots> shoky: any idas?
[13:17:45] <velcrobots> ideas
[13:17:59] <barraponto> i've seen some great templating libraries comparison
[13:18:09] <barraponto> but they don't compare to downloading markup.
[13:19:05] <Eviltwin> iSeeDeadPixels: :eq != :nth-child
[13:19:17] <Eviltwin> But that's also a horribly specific selector
[13:19:20] <iSeeDeadPixels> Eviltwin, what is nth-child?
[13:19:35] <Eviltwin> ?nth-child @ iSeeDeadPixels
[13:19:36] <bot-t> iSeeDeadPixels, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[13:19:41] <iSeeDeadPixels> i'm trying to convert my xpath to css selectors supported by jSoup
[13:20:04] <Eviltwin> And I'm saying those are horribly specific xpath selectors
[13:20:29] <barraponto> bot-t is healthy again!
[13:20:32] <barraponto> botsnack!
[13:20:38] <barraponto> botsnack
[13:20:41] <barraponto> botsnack?
[13:20:44] <barraponto> meh

[13:23:42] <iSeeDeadPixels> Eviltwin, you mean my xpath is specific?
[13:28:52] <exit2> I need some help with the .data() api http://dpaste.com/806467/ - I have a list of several objects that is being generated, each having a different code (which is showing correctly in the source).  But when I attach the console.log to the events it's only printing the "code" for the first one and not the one it belongs to
[13:30:57] <victorbjelkholm> exit2, is that jQuery really, the markup?
[13:33:05] <exit2> victorbjelkolm: it using a template language, but I'm using jQuery over it
[13:33:05] <chare> i need to make a chess board
[13:33:15] <chare> jqueryui a good option for chess?
[13:33:28] <Eviltwin> exit2: Read: http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[13:33:41] <Eviltwin> exit2: You may need to use .attr("data-code") instead
[13:33:46] <Eviltwin> chare: Probably not
[13:34:01] <chare> eviltwin: so i do what instead
[13:34:08] <Eviltwin> Use HTML
[13:34:27] <chare> eviltwin: i need some kind of javascript for the rules of chess don't i
[13:34:35] <Eviltwin> Yes
[13:34:51] <Eviltwin> jQuery UI is not going to help you with that
[13:35:24] <Eviltwin> Look at these demos under Interactions and Widgets: http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[13:35:33] <Eviltwin> Those are the pieces jQuery UI provides, nothing more
[13:35:34] <velcrobots> anyone have any ideas how i can get the "back to top" sticky link to be INSIDE the wrapper div?
[13:35:35] <velcrobots> http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/6qrQF/1/
[13:36:14] <chare> eviltwin: doesn't jqueryui simplify with the drag and dropping of chess pieces?
[13:36:26] <Eviltwin> You're welcome to try to do that
[13:36:40] <Eviltwin> I think it's going to make the problem more difficult, not less
[13:36:46] <chare> eviltwin: so how am i suppose to do drag and dropping of pieces without jqueryui?
[13:37:22] <Eviltwin> chare: Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/yKw4B/
[13:37:23] <Douilspee>  http://jsfiddle.net/7M7hp/2/  any optimisation welcome
[13:37:47] <Douilspee> item list with number of item < Max
[13:38:33] <chare> eviltwin: ok so how do i inject verifying a move is legal and undo the movement if its illegal
[13:38:45] <Eviltwin> That's where you're goign to have to write code
[13:39:13] <sypris> making a chess game?!
[13:39:14] <Eviltwin> Have you done JavaScript before?
[13:39:36] <chare> eviltwin: if i say no will you write it for me ;)
[13:39:41] <Whirl3d> Does anyone know of any online services for managing all your social media? Maybe somebody knows of an ongoing jquery project or something?
[13:39:44] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ chare
[13:39:45] <bot-t> chare, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[13:39:49] <Eviltwin> I'll link that to you
[13:40:09] <chare> javascript isn't the problem for me, its understanding how to use it on the dom
[13:40:14] <rakm> hey everyone, how do I get the response from an ajax  call to download a file?
[13:40:16] <rakm> https://gist.github.com/6f9a1d5d7d3b67fd64f3
[13:40:28] <rakm> that's what I have so far
[13:41:19] <Eviltwin> Convert it to a <form target="_blank" action="/projects/#{project.id}/layout">...</form> and submit the form
[13:41:32] <Eviltwin> method="get" in there too
[13:42:06] <rakm> Eviltwin :/ using Ember.js for all the UI
[13:42:32] <chare> eviltwin: 1 bitcoin to write chess program for me
[13:42:41] <Eviltwin> Then have jQuery build the form
[13:42:48] <Eviltwin> chare: Why do you need this anyway?
[13:43:05] <chare> eviltwin: you hate chess? you like playing video games instead?
[13:43:38] <Eviltwin> No, but I also don't build my own wheels everytime I want to drive somewhere
[13:44:16] <clone1018> Hey there, I have an array of strings and I'm using the jQuery.each function to loop over them, and then using $("#" + this).val(); to get the value of the input element, but for some reason it's returning undefined, anyone have any ideas?
[13:44:43] <Eviltwin> $.each over strings has a weird "this"
[13:45:01] <Eviltwin> Use $.each(..., function(i, str) { /* use str instead */ });
[13:45:03] <clone1018> What about $.each(values, function(i, value) {}); ?
[13:45:08] <clone1018> I tried that too
[13:46:31] <Eviltwin> Try console.log-ing the "#" + value and make sure it's what you expect
[13:46:32] <BillCriswell> clone1018: Are you sure the input elements have an id of string?
[13:46:33] <manuell> only use $(this).attr("attr..") instead of: $("#" + this)..
[13:46:58] <clone1018> values = ["this","is","what","im","doing"];
[13:46:58] <Eviltwin> manuell: ...those are completely different things
[13:47:16] <chare> eviltwin: how about we start open source chess jquery
[13:47:21] <chare> you go make initial commit
[13:47:33] <manuell> but when you loop over input elements, you can use this to get the value
[13:47:47] <Eviltwin> chare: Okay, I added jquery-1.8.2.min.js
[13:47:50] <Eviltwin> Your turn

[13:48:16] <clone1018> It's returning [prevObject: e.fn.e.init[1], context: #document, selector: "# state"]
[13:48:23] <manuell> or not
[13:48:24] <manuell> ?
[13:48:29] <chare> eviltwin: you don't want to help the chess community?
[13:48:30] <Eviltwin> chare: See that space in there?
[13:48:36] <Eviltwin> clone1018: ^
[13:48:41] <clone1018>  Yes, why is it there?
[13:48:59] <BillCriswell> Do you have a fiddle of it?
[13:49:10] <Eviltwin> chare: Not particularly
[13:49:11] <clone1018> It's almost exactly what I've pasted thus far
[13:49:14] <Eviltwin> They have better options anyway
[13:49:41] <chare> eviltwin: so find me a jquery chess implementation already out there
[13:49:44] <Whirl3d> Krambiorix, you have been in this room for hours today trying to get this handled. Why not create a fiddle and ask for help?
[13:49:56] <NoiseEee> please to stop all the LOL chare
[13:50:07] <clone1018> Eviltwin: there are no spaces in the $("#"+value) or in the values array
[13:50:10] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, no, i did something else first
[13:50:31] <Whirl3d> cool. so long as you are being productive.
[13:50:55] <clone1018> Haha yes there is, thanks for your help.
[13:50:59] <Whirl3d> (i'd laugh out loud, but NoiseEee has a headache, I gather)
[13:51:11] <BillCriswell> clone1018: http://jsfiddle.net/LzsDt/
[13:51:14] <Krambiorix> :p
[13:51:28] <BillCriswell> Ah, too late.
[13:51:34] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, would the if be wrong?
[13:52:48] <manuell> ah, okay, "this" is the id of the input element :)
[13:53:00] <Whirl3d> Krambiorix, try this in the console:  console.log($("td").first().css("backgroundColor")) and see if the response is what you expect.
[13:53:13] <Eviltwin> manuell: Finally catching up
[13:53:38] <manuell> Eviltwin ?
[13:53:55] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, why first() ? $(this) is the td
[13:54:03] <BillCriswell> I don't think I've ever seen .first().
[13:54:04] <Whirl3d> Any td will work.
[13:54:46] <Whirl3d> just look at your output when you ask for the backgroundColor css property...
[13:56:28] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, output: :transparent
[13:58:11] <Whirl3d> Loop through them all till you get one that's not transparent and make sure it looks exactly like what you are comparing it to in your if statement.
[13:58:29] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, i don't get it
[13:58:29] <manuell> good night!
[13:58:44] <Whirl3d> for example if it says rgba(0,0,210,40)   that's not gonna match
[14:00:07] <Whirl3d> it might say "#339933"....I don't know what the result SHOULD look like to tell you if your comparison IS or ISNT wrong...
[14:01:17] <chare> noiseeee: you want to help make the chas board
[14:01:50] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, i know what it is , it's rgb(0, 0, 255)   -> so it says it's blue, but i see green in front of my eyes
[14:02:10] <Whirl3d> it might even say "green" or some other string result....then comparing RGB(anything) to a string "green" isn't gonna fly.
[14:02:48] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: http://api.jquery.com/css/ the second paragraph mentions this stuff. Interesting. You might have to use like a class or something.
[14:03:18] <Krambiorix> Whirl3d, it goes in the else statement ... i don't check on blue or rgb(0,0,255) ...
[14:03:19] <NoiseEee> chare: i would, but the lineup to help you is too long and i don't feel like laying around waiting all day

[14:04:20] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: I also may have come in late though!
[14:04:47] <NoiseEee> chare: chess murdered my family.

[14:05:28] <NoiseEee> chare: thank god you have 1,000,000 places to play it online then!!
[14:06:08] <chare> eviltwin: you're not writing it for me, you're writing it for the entire community
[14:06:14] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, , i have a click event on every table cell. When i click it and i check which color the background is, i get blue and it should be green...

[14:07:31] <Eviltwin> What the hell does that mean?
[14:07:33] <BillCriswell> This chare dude is pretty interesting.
[14:07:45] <chare> billcriswell: so you want to help?

[14:08:12] <twohackers> Hi All! Wanting to manipulate SVG inside object / embed tag with JQ -- any ideas?
[14:08:17] <Eviltwin> In fact we'd like you to stop asking us to make a chess game for you
[14:08:47] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: What background color is set in the CSS?
[14:09:11] <chare> billcriswell: chess jquery is gonna be under GPL3
[14:09:21] <chare> don't you want to help the open source community
[14:09:29] <BillCriswell> I don't want to feed a troll.
[14:09:32] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, #00d228
[14:09:41] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, = some kind of green
[14:09:53] <chare> i'm not a troll
[14:10:44] <Eviltwin> chare: We'd like you to stop asking, we're here to help with specfic jQuery questions
[14:10:52] <Eviltwin> Like a small piece of code that's not working
[14:11:02] <Eviltwin> If you want to make a jQuery chess game, please see ?learn
[14:11:03] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:11:04] <Eviltwin> And learn how to do it
[14:11:36] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, why you ask?
[14:12:03] <austinpray> can anyone explain a simple .htaccess concept to me?
[14:12:15] <Eviltwin> austinpray: Wrong channel for that
[14:12:17] <BillCriswell> austinpray: You probably want #htdocs
[14:12:21] <austinpray> thanks
[14:12:36] <BillCriswell> austinpray: Sorry, #httpd
[14:12:42] <BillCriswell> Fucking letters, hate them all!
[14:12:51] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/N8fjW/ works just fine for me.
[14:13:04] <twohackers> Nudge: Wanting to manipulate SVG inside object / embed tag with JQ -- any ideas?
[14:13:21] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: You must have a closing tag off somewhere. Validate your HTML and try again.
[14:13:31] <twohackers> ID seems to return null
[14:13:51] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, in your fiddle i click but nothing in the console
[14:14:25] <Whirl3d> Krambiorix, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/vSKhU/9/
[14:14:38] <BillCriswell> It should. You might have the wrong panel selected? Anyway.. change it to an alert or something.
[14:15:03] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/vSKhU/10/
[14:15:39] <Whirl3d> Notice the difference? Hint: a space after the commas in the color value makes enough of a difference.
[14:20:36] <styol> Is this correct? jQuery 1.3.2 -- $('#selector').live('mousedown', function(){}); -- jQuery 1.7 -- $(document).on('mousedown', '#selector', function(){}); -- If so, any ideas why it might not work in either scenario for an AJAX call that is returning new DOM with the specified #selector? (note: mousedown is not being used by choice)
[14:20:42] <shoky> Whirl3d !!
[14:20:59] <shoky> where tf you been
[14:21:03] <Whirl3d> shoky! I wondered where you were....what's up?
[14:21:08] <shoky> kay ;p
[14:21:21] <shoky> haven't seen you for a couple months
[14:21:30] <Whirl3d> I got sooo burnedout on a couple clients that I quit my job and took a month or two off computers all together. LOL
[14:21:54] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Jealous.
[14:22:16] <shoky> that sounds like an awesome idea
[14:22:53] <BillCriswell> A good project manager would make my job a million times better.
[14:23:01] <NoiseEee> s/good//
[14:23:05] <Whirl3d> I think they call it a mid-life crisis (or transformation depending on how many lesbian friends you have)
[14:23:06] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, the weird thing is that my console.log is performed 3 times when i just click 1 time
[14:23:22] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: I really think you have some bad HTML in there.
[14:23:24] <shoky> heh
[14:23:29] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Validate it.
[14:23:50] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Haha, I don't have one either, but I can see how a bad one would make it 100 times worse.
[14:24:12] <BillCriswell> I hate calling clients.
[14:24:42] <Whirl3d> I hate clients that think they are designers...bah
[14:25:07] <callumacrae> Whirl3d: What if the client is a designer?
[14:25:28] <BillCriswell> callumacrae: Oddly enough... if they're not a web designer that makes them even worse.
[14:25:35] <Whirl3d> if they don't suck, it's groovy. But man the folks I have been working with have no design skill at all...
[14:25:57] <Whirl3d> But they are gonna insist on hobo for body copy...
[14:26:12] <Whirl3d> or some other horrible horrible, career-killing move..
[14:26:45] <Biomech> anyone know if the facebook sdk is hosted anywhere like google do?
[14:28:14] <BillCriswell> Biomech: I thought facebook hosted it?
[14:28:21] <Biomech> nuh they make you download it
[14:28:24] <Biomech> tight bastards
[14:28:43] <BillCriswell> The JavaScript one?
[14:29:02] <Biomech> php
[14:29:16] <BillCriswell> You're in jQuery.
[14:29:16] <Biomech> sorry, this is jquery :P i was read js code a minute ago
[14:29:23] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[14:29:39] <grantg> wut
[14:30:01] <Biomech> im trying to get the latest facebook album cover to display on my site :P
[14:30:02] <BillCriswell> You mean Google can host PHP code for you that doesn't have to run locally?
[14:30:15] <BillCriswell> have to run on your server*
[14:30:35] <Biomech> you would include it
[14:31:13] <BillCriswell> like... require 'http://www.foo.com/facebook-sdk' ?
[14:31:27] <Biomech> yeah
[14:32:09] <BillCriswell> Didn't know that was possible...
[14:32:40] <Biomech> probably isnt, i mean, it wouldnt make any sense if it was ;P
[14:33:09] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, how can i get the html code in jquery to validate?
[14:33:43] <BillCriswell> Copy the code that's generated and manually validate it I guess?
[14:34:34] <jastor> .live .. nice :D
[14:34:38] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
[14:35:01] <jastor> ive been doing jquery for quite some time now and had almost totally missed that one (other than just reading it quickly ages ago)
[14:35:21] <BillCriswell> jastor: There's .on() now that is pretty much replacing that.
[14:35:31] <jastor> BillCriswell: ok :)
[14:36:08] <webchatuser>  ^Ã‚ÃŠÃŽÃ”Ã›Ã¢ÃªÃ®Ã´Ã»ÄˆÄ‰ÄœÄÄ¤Ä¥Ä´ÄµÅœÅÅ´ÅµÅ¶Å·Ë†Ì‚Ì­á·á¸’á¸“á¸˜á¸™á¸¼á¸½á¹Šá¹‹á¹°á¹±á¹¶á¹·áºáº‘áº¤áº¥áº¦áº§áº¨áº©áºªáº«áº¬áº­áº¾áº¿á»€á»á»‚á»ƒá»„á»…á»†á»‡á»á»‘á»’á»“á»”á»•á»–á»—á»˜á»™â¨£â¨¶â©¯êžˆï¼¾ó ž
[14:36:23] <BillCriswell> Biomech: Everything I'm reading about doing what you're suggesting is making it sound like a bad idea ( seems you need to enable allow_url_include ).
[14:36:29] <jastor> BillCriswell: evne nonexisting elements?
[14:36:35] <grantgalitz>  à² _à² 
[14:36:38] <Biomech> yeah, but its cool, the facebook sdk isn't too fat
[14:36:38] <BillCriswell> jastor: Yes.
[14:36:44] <jastor> BillCriswell: ok :)
[14:36:46] <Biomech> it's just excessive for what i need :(
[14:36:47] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[14:37:11] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, but how to get the current html source?
[14:37:27] <BillCriswell> In your console you should be able to cop as html
[14:37:28] <BillCriswell> copy
[14:37:32] <styol> jastor: yes, if you use the delegated events style (in theory, trying to prove this theory)
[14:37:41] <styol> *still trying
[14:37:59] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: We could have this figured out 25 times if we could see your code.
[14:39:51] <jastor> styol: on the what now?
[14:40:13] <styol> jastor: what version of jQuery are you using?
[14:40:23] <jastor> styol: 181
[14:40:33] <BillCriswell> jQuery of the future ;)
[14:40:33] <webchatuser>  ^Ã‚ÃŠÃŽÃ”Ã›Ã¢ÃªÃ®Ã´Ã»ÄˆÄ‰ÄœÄÄ¤Ä¥Ä´ÄµÅœÅÅ´ÅµÅ¶Å·Ë†Ì‚Ì­á·á¸’á¸“á¸˜á¸™á¸¼á¸½á¹Šá¹‹á¹°á¹±á¹¶á¹·áºáº‘áº¤áº¥áº¦áº§áº¨áº©áºªáº«áº¬áº­áº¾áº¿á»€á»á»‚á»ƒá»„á»…á»†á»‡á»á»‘á»’á»“á»”á»•á»–á»—á»˜á»™â¨£â¨¶â©¯êžˆï¼¾ó ž
[14:40:40] <BillCriswell> Poor guy.
[14:40:42] <styol> jastor: the live method has been deprecated in favor of the on method using delegated events
[14:40:51] <grantgalitz> à² _à² 
[14:41:14] <jastor> styol: ok
[14:41:56] <styol> jastor: which, from what i can tell, means using a selector that is available when the dom is and then providing the target selector as the delegate.. it is described on the documentation for on towards the bottom and an example is provided on the documentation for live
[14:44:05] <styol> my setup must be using voodoo because i can't get either to work as expected, usually it means i iz doing it wrong but i've used live before quite a couple times, just not in this exact setup
[14:44:55] <jastor> styol, BillCriswell: thanks :)
[14:45:06] <styol> back to a dirty recursive bind function for me i suppose :(
[14:45:12] <Whirl3d> .live is .on applied to the entire dom  which makes it terribly inefficient. So rather than applying .on to the entire dom, you can apply .on to the most specific container element for the element you are listening for...
[14:45:32] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[14:46:11] <jastor> i should update my jquery skills :)
[14:46:31] <Whirl3d> so, for example, listening for cells in a table, you could apply .on to the table and filter your results for td's as the target. So long as the event bubbles, you are good to go.
[14:46:32] <jastor> too bad they dropped .tmpl
[14:47:49] <BillCriswell> jastor: Think of it like this... $('.i_hold_dynamic_things').on('click', '.something-dynamic', function(e){ /* Party time! */ });
[14:48:13] <jastor> BillCriswell: yea ive gotten the genral idea :)
[14:48:14] <styol> Whirl3d: any idea if 'mousedown' is a supported event by the on method?
[14:48:20] <BillCriswell> jastor: Ah, ok!
[14:48:42] <Whirl3d> styol, I believe it is.
[14:49:17] <Whirl3d> I'll double check in a fiddle. brb
[14:49:20] <styol> yeah its gotta be, just adjusted a random example
[14:49:35] <appel> I'm doing a lot of:     var caller = this;  $.ajax(url).done(function(results) { caller.dosomething(results); });    What I mean is .. I'm defining a lot of "var caller = this" so I can call it later. Is there a better way to do this?
[14:49:59] <styol> Whirl3d: it's ok, you iz right.. i can't confirm whether or not it works properly within an AJAX / dynamic elements scenario but the basic implementation should work
[14:50:52] <shoky> appel: not really
[14:51:04] <jastor> appel: i dont think i use it as much as you .. but if you find any answer please tell me .)
[14:51:24] <appel> hmm... kkk
[14:51:33] <appel> just feels... unclean
[14:51:48] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, i found the culprit: the on('click'   is being performed 2 times
[14:52:30] <shoky> appel: there might be cleaner ways to deal with it depending on your code structure.. like caching the reference to those elements somewhere more global
[14:52:45] <Whirl3d> styol, just make sure that you are listening for the event on the parent container of your dynamic content and it should work.
[14:52:54] <appel> well, global variables are no better
[14:52:56] <appel> :)
[14:53:03] <shoky> i didn't say global
[14:53:08] <shoky> ;)
[14:53:20] <shoky> all i meant was, less local ;]
[14:53:24] <appel> :>
[14:53:52] <styol> Whirl3d: yeah, it must be something else strangeness.. document, body, etc should be high enough up hehe
[14:54:22] <styol> appel: if you don't want to have a bunch of dangling variables i guess you could collect them in an object like callers.abc = this;
[14:54:31] <Whirl3d> you mean to simulate .live....since that's all it is. hehe
[14:54:41] <krasslex> hi, now i reduced my problem to an easy case: http://catering-website.de/test.html
[14:54:42] <appel> styol: nah, i'd rather have var caller = this
[14:54:52] <styol> Whirl3d: sure, i tried more specific, worked my way upwards
[14:55:01] <shoky> appel: but if it only makes sense to refer to it locally, then doing 'var self = this'  is fine and pretty much as clean as it gets. you'll see it a lot in lots of good javascript code
[14:55:03] <krasslex> just click on the select an choose "farbe"
[14:55:42] <krasslex> it only works, if the alert is in the code. without the alert it doesn't work
[14:56:04] <appel> so, what sort of javascript coding you guys do?
[14:56:07] <appel> what sort of projects
[14:56:10] <krasslex> i think it is a beginner problem wit sync/asyn
[14:56:52] <jastor> appel: 1 site (about movies, grabs TMDB and IMDB info/pictures) and 1 project (wh40k armybuilder)
[14:57:00] <shoky> i'm currently working on a svg-heavy project with knockout.js and a bit of jquery
[14:57:11] <appel> ah, cool, near my domain... i do gui for iptv
[14:57:23] <Whirl3d> Last I heard, Shoky was independently rewriting the code for brain surgeons to automate laser functions on the human brain during lobotomes...
[14:57:28] <appel> svg???
[14:57:30] <appel> o_O
[14:57:50] <Whirl3d> in his spare time.
[14:57:51] <shoky> yes, there are many shapes and shit that you move around
[14:57:59] <shoky> and also what Whirl3d said
[14:58:02] <krasslex> can anyone help me fixing my jquery-problem?
[14:58:15] <AndChat220596> Jasor: interesting. Do you have it online?
[14:58:17] <appel> isn't svg too cpu intensive?
[14:58:50] <shoky> no?
[14:59:00] <rue> Whirl3d: The SVG is definitely handy for drawing the incision vectors
[14:59:31] <Whirl3d> I tell ya without shoky, my lobotome would have been a disaster..
[14:59:33] <jastor> AndChat220596: the movie site is wp based .. still working on the plugin ... the 40k armybuilder .. no
[14:59:36] <shoky> lawll
[15:00:06] <AndChat220596> Ok
[15:00:38] <jastor> AndChat220596: which one was it you were interested in?
[15:00:56] <AndChat220596> The imdb related
[15:01:06] <jastor> AndChat220596: kk
[15:02:04] <jastor> AndChat220596: its basically a site for remmebering your moviecollection .. shows trailers, basic movieinfo, mpaa rating, posters, cast etc. .. showing upcomming movies and movies shown on cinemas
[15:02:21] <jastor> AndChat220596: gonna have a mobile version for carrying with you when buying new movies
[15:02:43] <AndChat220596> I think their api is not so user frendly, right?
[15:02:58] <jastor> AndChat220596: which one? TMDB or IMDB? tmdb is no problem
[15:03:01] <AndChat220596> imdb
[15:03:17] <jastor> AndChat220596: i got a class for getting IMDB info in other ways
[15:03:45] <AndChat220596> do you use html sculpting?
[15:03:52] <appel> why use knockout.js ? or... why even use such a heavy weight mvc framework? why not just make your own?
[15:04:00] <krasslex> no one interested in solving me jquery problem?
[15:04:13] <jastor> AndChat220596: sculpting? (not familiar with that word since im not english native)
[15:05:12] <Eviltwin> krasslex: Have a jsFiddle?
[15:05:38] <AndChat220596> jason: scraping, sorry
[15:05:39] <Whirl3d> I am always blown away by how many people in here aren't native English speakers. Just amazing to me.
[15:05:44] <krasslex> sorry, i'm the first time here. what is jsFiddle?
[15:05:59] <AndChat220596> Im not english native
[15:06:05] <rmurphey> krasslex: http://jsfiddle.net/
[15:06:15] <Whirl3d> I'd have never guessed...
[15:06:16] <rmurphey> you can create a reduced demo that other people can fork and modify
[15:06:27] <jastor> AndChat220596: thats basically what the class does yes .. but i can skip imdb alltogether since i get what i need from TMDB
[15:06:33] <jastor> i got a proper apikey from them
[15:06:34] <shoky> appel: knockout.js isn't really a framework and it's not too heavy. and i use it because it lets me focus on my models and their properties instead of on the views and how do i update/query them
[15:07:00] <appel> i work against rest backends and I could never use knockout.js with it
[15:07:38] <shoky> sure you could. it might not some smoothing out but i don't see why not
[15:07:48] <appel> in fact there's not a single proper library out there that handles rest backend communication
[15:08:01] <jastor> appel: write one!!
[15:08:02] <shoky> anyway KO isn't much about the backend
[15:08:09] <appel> :)
[15:08:31] <appel> i might
[15:08:37] <appel> what should i call it?
[15:08:43] <jastor> appel: appetizer
[15:08:48] <appel> wrestler
[15:08:54] <jastor> nice one
[15:08:57] <jastor> restless
[15:09:22] <jastor> a bit gay sorry for saying so but crest?
[15:09:23] <appel> task #1: make a cool logo
[15:09:37] <jastor> short and easy to remember
[15:11:22] <rmurphey> jastor: "gay"?
[15:11:49] <jastor> i msorry if i offnded someone
[15:12:05] <snover> are you really?
[15:12:30] <rmurphey> please refrain from using that word in a derogatory way here. thanks.
[15:12:51] <krasslex> i'm not familar to jsfiddle. would anyone please look ul the demo-page: http://catering-website.de/test.html
[15:12:53] <snover> or anywhere, really
[15:13:25] <krasslex> just select the option in the first select
[15:13:41] <krasslex> it only works, if the alert ist in the code
[15:13:55] <krasslex> must be a sync/async problem with ajax
[15:14:13] <rmurphey> krasslex: jsfiddle is for making a reduced test case of the problem
[15:14:22] <Whirl3d> ++ rmurphey, snover!
[15:14:23] <rmurphey> one that removes all extraneous pieces
[15:14:36] <rmurphey> krasslex: i cannot get your site to appear
[15:14:40] <rmurphey> it just keeps loading
[15:16:16] <krasslex> ie and ff load the site properly on my client
[15:16:21] <rmurphey> chrome does not
[15:17:39] <ryanneufeld> rmurphey: Nice to see you here
[15:17:43] <ryanneufeld> been a while
[15:17:49] <krasslex> ok, then i'm going to try this in jsfiddle
[15:17:49] <rmurphey> i'm here now and then
[15:18:12] <krasslex> should the ajax request then simply call the php on my webspace?
[15:19:11] <rmurphey> krasslex: jsfiddle allows you to simulate ajax requests
[15:19:35] <rmurphey> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[15:20:05] <rmurphey> you can make a request to /echo/json/ and provide the same data your server would return
[15:21:14] <AndChat220596> bye
[15:21:23] <dogmatic69> I am stuck using "uniform" plugin and cant seem to get input changes. Anyone know how this thing works?
[15:21:46] <dogmatic69> $('#foobar').change(function() {alert(123);}); does nothing :/
[15:21:54] <rmurphey> krasslex: i am not able to get your site to come up in firefox, either ... is it working for anyone else?
[15:21:58] <rmurphey> http://catering-website.de/test.html
[15:22:48] <shoky> loads for me
[15:22:59] <ryanneufeld> me as well
[15:23:04] <rmurphey> huh
[15:23:09] <rmurphey> maybe just shitty hotel wifi
[15:23:35] <rmurphey> it just spins and spins for me
[15:23:50] <ryanneufeld> beachballed
[15:24:25] <krasslex> maybe in the testfile the coding is not correct utf8 etc
[15:24:52] <krasslex> only copied the generated code and reduced it to the minimum
[15:28:22] <shoky> krasslex: what's the problem again?
[15:29:07] <krasslex> ok, thx for listening
[15:29:40] <krasslex> adding a select via ajax and after this give this select the choosen class
[15:30:10] <krasslex> the assign of the class only works, if there is an alert or a prompt before the class assign
[15:31:05] <krasslex> just try to select the option in the first select
[15:31:26] <shoky> ya i see the alert..
[15:31:31] <krasslex> actually the alert is in the code, thus it works
[15:31:41] <krasslex> ok, now i remove the alert
[15:32:17] <shoky> its still there
[15:32:30] <shoky> k
[15:32:32] <krasslex> please reload and try again
[15:32:45] <shoky> ok, no alert, what doesnt work?
[15:32:55] <shoky> seems like it works fine
[15:33:30] <krasslex> the new alert keeps the normal select, but not a select with the class chosen
[15:33:43] <shoky> oh
[15:34:22] <krasslex> i think this is a problem with sync/async concerning ajax
[15:34:49] <krasslex> maybe the select isn't in the DOM when the script tryes ta assign the class
[15:35:01] <shoky> you need to call .chosen(..)  on the new select only after you've added it to the DOM, inside the ajax callback
[15:35:13] <krasslex> if an alert is between the adding and the assign, it works
[15:35:14] <shoky> if i understnad what you want..
[15:35:58] <krasslex> code here: http://catering-website.de/js/jquery/custom/artikeltest.js
[15:36:12] <shoky> i know
[15:36:22] <shoky> you need to move the .chosen(...) call inside the ajax callback..
[15:36:31] <shoky> .ajax(...) returns immediately
[15:36:49] <shoky> and .post(...)
[15:37:08] <krasslex> ok, i tryed this call in different lines already
[15:37:26] <krasslex> where do you think should i do this?
[15:38:55] <shoky> something more like: http://pastebin.com/W7fc1CGf
[15:42:11] <shoky> and maybe move lines 25-26 also inside the ajax callback if you wanna. would have to change 'this' tho
[15:43:06] <krasslex> sorry, doesn't work
[15:43:14] <krasslex> plz reload an test
[15:43:41] <krasslex> sorry, i was to slow
[15:43:44] <krasslex> please wait
[15:46:49] <krasslex> ok, now it works
[15:46:56] <krasslex> thx you very much
[15:50:05] <krasslex> thx for helping and gn8
[16:22:44] <Rockfang> hi all
[16:31:32] <Rockfang> I have a question. I'm using the jQuery Validation plugin to validate a form. Unfortunately, if I click the submit button to submit the form before entering any text into the form, the form always shows up as valid.
[16:31:47] <Rockfang> my code is at http://jsfiddle.net/QVtye/
[16:32:26] <Rockfang> when i test the code in firefox, the alert in the form even always shows up
[16:32:35] <Rockfang> form event*
[16:32:42] <Rockfang> any ideas why this might be?
[16:32:42] <rmurphey> Rockfang: the demo doesn't seem to be loading the validate plugin
[16:33:12] <Rockfang> yeah, i noticed that as well.
[16:33:53] <Rockfang> not too worried about that issue at the moment though
[16:34:01] <shoky> Rockfang:   $("loanForm").validate({
[16:34:08] <rmurphey> ok but i can't see it not working without it :)
[16:34:10] <shoky> think you meant $("#loanForm")
[16:34:23] <Rockfang> oh my fricking gosh lol
[16:34:25] <Rockfang> ty
[16:34:25] <shoky> (here it is with the validate plugin http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QVtye/1/ )
[16:34:34] <Rockfang> ty shoky
[16:35:11] <Rockfang> i hate having problems like those :)
[16:35:55] <shoky> good think for IRC
[16:35:57] <shoky> thing
[16:36:09] <Rockfang> indeed :) helpful people are a good thing as well
[16:40:14] <Rockfang> would it be safe to assume that if i require an entry to be only digits that means it will also be a number by default?
[16:41:05] <shoky> lots of non-digits in -2.3
[16:41:35] <shoky> er
[16:41:57] <Rockfang> i think you misunderstood me
[16:41:58] <shoky> only digits sounds like a number yea
[16:42:13] <Rockfang> thanks, that what i figured, just wanted to make sure
[16:42:19] <shoky> yea sorry , just blurting out
[16:42:25] <Rockfang> no worries
[16:42:34] <shoky> starving and waiting for pizza
[16:44:07] <Rockfang> pizza sounds real tasty right about now :) last thing i ate was a few lunch meat sandwiches
[16:55:49] <Rockfang> in case anyone else reads that paste, the selectors in the final if are missing pound signs as well
[16:55:54] <Rockfang> :)
[17:39:34] <Nomikos> Is there a way to replace only the text in an element, not touching other elements like input?
[17:40:33] <Nomikos> Like <div id="foo">replace this text <input class"keepThis"></div>
[17:41:09] <L1> I am applying a class to an element, and right afterwards calling $('element').height() - however it's returning the height as if the class wasn't applied yet
[17:46:19] <L1> Nomikos: not as far as I know. But if you can't wrap the text in an element you could try something hackish like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/unEeg/
[17:51:36] <Nomikos> L1: that's an interesting approach :-) the * in 'div *' does not include the old text?
[17:52:07] <Nomikos> Obviously it works
[17:52:59] <L1> Nomikos: I think it will only select elements in the DOM, and text isn't considered a DOM element
[17:53:05] <L1> AFAIK, I;m no expert :)
[17:53:52] <Nomikos> L1: ah ok. I just replaced the string in the (3rd party script) library for now. But it's a cunning alternative
[17:54:12] <Nomikos> L1: out of curiosity, does your handle refer to lagrange points?
[17:54:47] <L1> Now, it's a nickname (my IRL name sounds similar to "L 1" when said out loud)
[17:54:49] <L1> nope*
[17:54:59] <Nomikos> heh ok
[17:57:00] <oojacoboo> $("#foo").val().html(); //no?
[17:58:03] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[17:58:04] <L1> Nomikos: Another solution here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11633610/how-to-remove-text-without-removing-inner-elements-from-a-parent-element-using
[17:58:15] <Eviltwin> .val() always returns a string
[17:58:21] <Eviltwin> Or undefined
[17:58:24] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: and the issue is what?
[17:58:28] <Eviltwin> Neither of which have an html method
[17:58:39] <oojacoboo> I thought .html() would encode that string
[17:58:40] <oojacoboo> no?
[17:58:51] <Eviltwin> ?js "my string".html()
[17:58:55] <bot-t> Eviltwin: TypeError: "my string".html is not a function
[17:58:55] <oojacoboo> how can I url encode a string then?  .serialize()?
[17:59:08] <Eviltwin> Why do you need to?
[17:59:18] <oojacoboo> b/c of how the values are passed in the url
[17:59:25] <oojacoboo> why not
[17:59:35] <Eviltwin> URLs don't use HTML encoding...
[17:59:43] <oojacoboo> how can I url encode a string then?  .serialize()?
[17:59:51] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs
[17:59:51] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[17:59:59] <oojacoboo> ...
[18:00:00] <Nomikos> encodeURIComponent() should work?
[18:00:17] <oojacoboo> yea, that should do Nomikos thanks
[18:00:23] <Eviltwin> ?encodeURIComponent("?=plus a")
[18:00:26] <Eviltwin> ?js encodeURIComponent("?=plus a")

[18:00:30] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "%3F%3Dplus%20a"
[18:02:11] <Nomikos> L1: thanks. Must remember .contents()
[18:07:38] <L1> So it seems like the DOM isn't updated immediately after calling $('bar').addClass('foo') which is why $('bar').height() is returning the wrong value afterwards
[18:08:10] <L1> Any ideas how to 1)Force DOM to update before continueing, 2)Callback when DOM has updated, 3) Other?
[18:12:06] <ngharo> meh .addClass() is syncronous.  It should have completed before the next call happens
[18:12:28] <ngharo> unless the browser is painting in a seperate thread in which case *head explodes*
[18:13:23] <Bika> hey guys. I'm just starting ti learn jquery. could anyone heelm me with the difference between: $('#test > id') and $('test id')
[18:13:41] <Bika> $('#test > id') and $('#test id')
[18:13:48] <ngharo> > is immediate child
[18:14:17] <ngharo> '#foo .bar' is all elements with class "bar" under #foo
[18:14:38] <Nomikos> Bika: what he said, just like in regular CSS. See http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#pattern-matching
[18:14:52] <Bika> oh! I got it
[18:15:07] <Bika> I'll check this link
[18:15:20] <Bika> thx guys
[18:19:03] <L1> ngharo: If it's syncronous, any ideas what's going on here then?  http://jsfiddle.net/6wMPd/
[18:23:07] <ngharo> not without any context
[18:23:10] <ngharo> post moar codez
[18:25:14] <L1> ngharo: basically, I want to apply a class to whichever <articles> in #main-content are not fully below #sidebar:   http://50.18.158.195/architecture-models
[18:25:52] <L1> (to stop the <article> at the bottom of the sidebar akwardly being half next to sidebar, half under sidebar, throwing off centering)
[18:28:48] <ngharo> to achieve a two column layout
[18:28:56] <ngharo> couldnt you just do some floats and be done with it?
[18:29:30] <L1> Then the content doesn't wrap under the sidebar when the sidebar ends
[18:30:06] <L1> I could certainly just float the whole #main-content right and everything would line up perfectly but I'm trying to use the space under the sidebar
[18:32:31] <ngharo> like dis: http://jsfiddle.net/6wMPd/1/
[18:37:19] <L1> ngharo: Yes but I'm trying to avoid one article being akwardly wrapped around the bottom of the sidebar:  http://jsfiddle.net/6wMPd/2/
[18:38:03] <L1> Err, just realised the <p> I highlighted is only gonna be the wrapping one if we are running the same resolution browser :/
[18:38:28] <ngharo> hehe yeah, i get you
[18:39:40] <chare> <tr id =<%= "sq#{i}#{j}" %>>
[18:39:41] <chare> how am i suppose to write this in erb correctly?
[18:40:30] <coldhead> want to ask in #rails maybe chare?
[18:40:44] <chare> they are all afk
[18:41:06] <ngharo> L1: I asked my layout friend
[18:41:10] <ngharo> she's good
[18:41:11] <ngharo> im dumb
[18:41:17] <ngharo> let's wait and see if I get a response
[18:41:19] <L1> :p Thanks!
[18:44:05] <L1> ngharo: Got my original JS working just now. Instead of adding up all the heights, I realised I could use .offset().top - so it's working fine now (with JS)
[18:44:10] <L1> Thanks for your help though :)
[18:44:18] <ngharo> wewt cool

[21:42:19] <w00tner> but is not working
[21:42:57] <w00tner> im using jquery v1.7.1
[21:45:55] <w00tner> this is my code> http://jsfiddle.net/ZRNVP/1/
[21:46:02] <coldhead> does it work if you quote the name: [name="tipo"] ?
[21:46:14] <w00tner> let me check
[21:47:58] <coldhead> it works for me without them
[21:56:54] <Hilton> Can someone look at something WITHOUT making me build a big dummy site to demonstrate it? The code should be pretty self-explanatory as to what it is supposed to do, but datepicker() isn't cooperating.
[22:02:59] <w00tner> is working now coldhead, thanks.
[22:03:04] <Hilton> Okay I did something minimal, ignoring the errors for missing variables etc that won't matter...
[22:03:05] <Hilton> http://jsfiddle.net/QsrSt/
[22:03:18] <w00tner> i was typing an extra parentesis
[22:03:21] <w00tner> >S
[22:03:28] <w00tner> but now is workiing yeahh baby
[22:03:29] <tw2113> everyone being kind to you coldhead ?
[22:03:44] <w00tner> wanna a lap dance ?
[22:08:45] <ocfx> i want lapdance
[22:09:24] <Hilton> http://jsfiddle.net/QsrSt/1/
[22:09:34] <Hilton> Datepicker is not appearing on dynamically generated elements.
[22:09:46] <Hilton> The new element gets the class and ID assigned, but datepicker never appears.
[22:09:56] <coldhead> you have to call datepicker() again when you add the new elements
[22:10:07] <Hilton> coldhead: Try reading the code? I do.
[22:10:22] <Hilton> Also, the "// This is a test line" line (.css) does work on my end, but not in the fiddle for some reason.
[22:10:37] <coldhead> sorry Hilton, it's my first day using jQuery
[22:10:48] <coldhead> still learning how to read jsfiddle lol
[22:10:56] <ocfx> lol
[22:11:03] <ocfx> i just started learning jquery today too
[22:11:34] <ocfx> selectors still feel a bit awkward
[22:12:13] <coldhead> this selector $('input.date[tag='+tagv+']')
[22:12:21] <coldhead> doesn't seem to match the HTML i am seeing generated
[22:12:26] <coldhead> i see the tag on a div
[22:12:29] <coldhead> around the input
[22:12:36] <Hilton> Oh
[22:12:39] <Hilton> I forgot a class in the HTML
[22:13:05] <Hilton> My bad - http://jsfiddle.net/QsrSt/2/
[22:13:09] <Hilton> now the CSS line works! :P
[22:13:10] <Hilton> now the CSS line works! :P
[22:13:16] <Hilton> But still not datepicker.
[22:13:25] <ocfx> now the CSS line works! :p
[22:13:34] <coldhead> so i keep hearing
[22:14:34] <Hilton> I just forgot to add the class to the div which the selector looks for to add the attribute to all the form elements inside.
[22:15:04] <Hilton> I could probably replace that bit with a .children call of some kind after .slideDown, but I'll worry about that later - make it work, then improve!
[22:15:53] <Hilton> But my big issue is that datepicker never appears on dynamic elements, despite the dynamic element being called correctly and even getting the class and ID assigned by datepicker. I have a similar problem with the Autosize plugin, but I can do without that one.
[22:16:16] <coldhead> Hilton: comment out the initial datepicker()
[22:16:22] <coldhead> and it works
[22:16:36] <Hilton> Yes but then I lose it on all the other (static) fields that need it!
[22:16:37] <coldhead> so maybe that first call is being applied to the oe you clone somehow
[22:16:37] <coldhead> and fucking you up?
[22:16:50] <coldhead> so maybe try refining the selector
[22:16:57] <coldhead> to make sure it doesn't match the template
[22:17:09] <coldhead> like maybe use a different class in the template
[22:17:16] <coldhead> and change it to .date when you add it?
[22:17:29] <Hilton> Hey you're right.
[22:17:38] <Hilton> remove display:none and that input has a DP.
[22:17:47] <coldhead> bam
[22:17:53] <Hilton> Funny, I thought I once tested that it didn't. *checks on local site*
[22:18:58] <Hilton> Yep, same. Huh.
[22:19:18] <Hilton> Shouldn't $('*:not(.blank_group) input.date') select all elements EXCEPT those with class blank_group?
[22:19:57] <Hilton> I added that because just using input.date then //$('.blank_group input.date').datepicker('destroy'); screwed things up harsh.
[22:21:05] <Hilton> I realize *:not() is probably quite sub-optimal, selecting all elements on the page, but I couldn't think of another way to do it...and it doesn't work anyway.
[22:22:06] <khmer> Hilton: you're trying to select all elements that aren't descendents of .blank_group elements
[22:22:32] <khmer> Hilton: you might be looking for input.date:not(.blank_group) ?
[22:22:33] <Hilton> khmer: Specifically all input.date elements that aren't a descendent of .blank_group elements
[22:22:45] <khmer> ah yes well that ought to do it
[22:22:50] <khmer> though the asterisk is unnecessary
[22:23:40] <khmer> and so, incidentally, is the pseudoselector -- you should use the .not() method
[22:24:17] <Hilton> Well input.date:not() didn't work...
[22:26:08] <Already> $("input.date").not(".blank_group") ?
[22:27:16] <[1]javalover> how do I reference from the php file the object(in this case div) that i'm calling .load on
[22:27:22] <Hilton> Nope, that still didn't work.
[22:27:45] <[1]javalover> so mydiv.load("myphpfile.php");   how do i reference my div inside myphpfile.php?
[22:28:05] <Hilton> You'd think :not(.blank_group) input.date would work.
[22:28:28] <initself> i'm getting TypeError: $(".phone_call").popupWindow is not a function
[22:28:35] <initself> but I have installed jquery.popupWindow
[22:28:43] <initself> any ideas?
[22:28:50] <khmer> Hilton: your HTML must be a bit different than you think
[22:28:55] <[1]javalover> initself this can happen when $ is not referencing properly
[22:29:06] <Hilton> khmer: The line in the local HTML file is this
[22:29:07] <Hilton>   <div class="labour_group blank_group" id="labour_group_blank" style="display: none;">
[22:29:12] <[1]javalover> try jQuery(".phone_call");
[22:29:16] <[1]javalover> just to see
[22:29:24] <Hilton> All of the hidden groups to be cloned have class blank_group
[22:29:37] <initself> [1]javalover: same result
[22:29:48] <[1]javalover> idk i always get that error when $ is not referenced
[22:29:55] <Hilton> Can I do something like input.date:not(:hidden) in some way?
[22:29:56] <[1]javalover> i'm no expert just saying ur pain i've felt it
[22:30:03] <tw2113> your popupWindow script link isn't 404ing?
[22:30:03] <initself> maye the plug in itself is the issue
[22:30:07] <initself> i'll try reinstalling
[22:30:21] <khmer> [1]javalover: your question about how to reference a div is worrisome--you can't access a dom element from inside a php file, that's not how the web works. unless i'm misunderstanding your question
[22:30:27] <tw2113> jquery lib loaded first?
[22:30:34] <khmer> [1]javalover: your question is one of those "what are you trying to actually do" questions
[22:30:40] <Hilton> AH HAH I GOT IT
[22:30:50] <Hilton> $('input.date:visible').datepicker({ dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd' });
[22:30:53] <[1]javalover> well I want to add stuff to an existing div
[22:30:57] <Hilton> $('input.date:visible').datepicker({ dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd' });
[22:31:01] <[1]javalover> but I don't want to ECHO it back
[22:31:02] <Hilton> Sorry
[22:31:08] <initself> tw2113: it needs to e loaded first, right?  jquery?
[22:31:09] <[1]javalover> i want to replace it using jquery
[22:31:29] <[1]javalover> so in the end it's mydiv.replaceWith(newHTML);
[22:31:41] <tw2113> jquery needs to show up first
[22:32:05] <SexySatan> Hello boys and girls, my name is Satan.
[22:32:17] <tw2113> of course it is
[22:32:25] <[1]javalover> now the way i'm referencing it right now is by storing the object & recalling it on function call
[22:32:34] <[1]javalover> but I really hate that, and i'd like to just reference it based on .load
[22:33:20] * SexySatan scratches his hairy chest and says, "Save our Military Industrial Complex. Vote for Mitt Romney."
[22:34:01] <khmer> [1]javalover: that's what .load() does...
[22:34:20] <[1]javalover> hmmm
[22:34:20] <initself> got it.  plugin was not correctly installed for the page i am working with.
[22:34:22] <initself> thanks all!
[22:34:31] <[1]javalover> so you think I should just echo it back then?
[22:34:59] <coldhead> good work, Hilton
[22:35:03] <coldhead> ingenius fix
[22:35:11] <khmer> [1]javalover: if you mean "respond with an html fragment to the ajax call" then yes
[22:35:21] <[1]javalover> not using ajax
[22:35:29] <khmer> [1]javalover: you have to
[22:35:34] <[1]javalover> i use jquery.load
[22:35:55] <khmer> [1]javalover: all XmlHttpRequest techniques get kinda casually referred to as "ajax"
[22:36:05] <[1]javalover> oh
[22:36:05] <khmer> [1]javalover: and under the hood, .load() uses .ajax() :)
[22:36:10] <[1]javalover> ic
[22:36:23] <[1]javalover> well basically I have a javascript function inside my .php file
[22:36:36] <[1]javalover> and this function creates the object which I was returning as newhtml
[22:36:47] <[1]javalover> and then myobj.replaceWith(newhtml);
[22:37:01] <[1]javalover> so how would I from within javascript idk printhtml if you will
[22:37:11] <tw2113> isn't this for the load you were using? "Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event."
[22:37:19] <[1]javalover> the reason I have javascript is for fonts & sizes
[22:37:29] <khmer> tw2113: the .load() method is overloaded
[22:37:30] <[1]javalover> as php can't determine ur browser information
[22:38:23] <khmer> well, myDiv.load('/url') is supposed to replace the contents of myDiv with whatever /url returned
[22:38:30] <[1]javalover> well yeah but i'm saying
[22:38:36] <[1]javalover> all that I have in their is a javascript function
[22:38:47] <[1]javalover> which builds a string known as newhtml
[22:39:15] <[1]javalover> so how would I take this string & then say "k change mydiv.html('' + newhtml);
[22:39:19] <bigLanky> anyone interested in helping me build a custom slider?
[22:39:27] <bigLanky> its for my company and i can pay whatever it takes
[22:39:34] <tw2113> we need more sliders out in the wild?
[22:39:53] <khmer> [1]javalover: what is dynamic about this function that it needs to be returned as script separately
[22:39:58] <tw2113> there's already only 50?....million
[22:40:04] <[1]javalover> because I need browser information using javascript
[22:40:15] <ocfx> tw2113, this one is custom!
[22:40:21] <ocfx> lol
[22:40:23] <tw2113> as were every other one
[22:40:25] <[1]javalover> and for whatever reason I just decided to call a function from within it in order to replace it
[22:40:31] <ocfx> i know i was being facetious
[22:40:34] <tw2113> "i can do better!"
[22:40:36] <[1]javalover> but listening to you & my own intution it sounds like I can just change the existing thing
[22:40:38] <khmer> [1]javalover: well, let's not try to refactor all of your code right now, i guess!
[22:40:49] <[1]javalover> all i'm saying is thi
[22:40:50] <[1]javalover> this*
[22:40:53] <khmer> [1]javalover: i'm thinking that what you might want is to use .getScript()
[22:40:59] <[1]javalover> if i put <div>Hello World</div>
[22:41:07] <[1]javalover> i know the div would be replaced with that
[22:41:24] <[1]javalover> but I don't get how to do that from the javascript string I create
[22:41:42] <[1]javalover> unless I give it an id tag & replace it after the function..
[22:41:43] <[1]javalover> maybe...
[22:41:51] <khmer> i still don't see why the javascript function needs to come from ajax. is it not already on the page?
[22:42:09] <[1]javalover> no it's not
[22:42:12] <[1]javalover> it's only inside the php file
[22:42:20] <khmer> why isn't it? what does it need from the server!
[22:42:28] <khmer> you've told me what it needs from the client--navigator information
[22:42:28] <[1]javalover> the php data...
[22:42:39] <khmer> can the function not exist on the page itself
[22:42:45] <khmer> and run ajax against the server to retrieve the php data?
[22:42:51] <[1]javalover> well...I could rewrite it
[22:42:55] <Already> Put the script in the page and let it make an ajax call to retrieve the data?
[22:42:55] <[1]javalover> but I use php for the loops
[22:42:57] <khmer> i recommend rewriting it
[22:43:13] <khmer> this sounds convoluted enough that it will be a maintenance nightmare
[22:43:16] <khmer> write code you're proud of!
[22:43:22] <[1]javalover> I am proud of this
[22:43:24] <[1]javalover> I like how it works
[22:43:36] <khmer> i bet it works great
[22:43:38] <[1]javalover> it does less work overall
[22:43:42] <coldhead> good work, [1]javalover
[22:43:44] <Already> Just generate a json object which makes it easy to work with. ;)
[22:43:46] <khmer> but 6 months down the line when you know more about javascript, you will not like how it works
[22:43:50] <coldhead> why don't you take a break
[22:43:54] <[1]javalover> it's not that
[22:43:58] <[1]javalover> look which is better
[22:44:04] <[1]javalover> return php data
[22:44:08] <[1]javalover> decode that into javascript
[22:44:12] <[1]javalover> then loop through it
[22:44:13] <khmer> "php data" is extremely general
[22:44:15] <khmer> do you mean json?
[22:44:15] <[1]javalover> or just loop through the php data
[22:44:44] <[1]javalover> it can have ANYTHING returned
[22:44:48] <Already> get php data => finish "computing" it in php => pass it in a suitable form (json) to javascript.
[22:44:52] <[1]javalover> and all of this I use to loop
[22:45:08] <[1]javalover> yeah see Already, I think that's too many steps
[22:45:11] <khmer> i mean, all other things being equal, i'd say it's better to do hard work on the server and build flat models on the client, but...
[22:45:21] <[1]javalover> I create my object using the php
[22:45:30] <khmer> this is quickly becoming a communication problem, since i don't think you and we are using the same set of terms
[22:45:34] <khmer> can you perhaps jsfiddle this
[22:45:39] <khmer> using a fixture for your php data?
[22:45:43] <[1]javalover> look it's a simple question i'll restate
[22:45:51] <khmer> no, i have to insist actually
[22:46:02] <khmer> i know it feels simple but you are bumping up against architectural best practices
[22:46:06] <[1]javalover> how do I replace the contents of a div via .load()  using a javascript string of html?
[22:46:07] <coldhead> lolsss
[22:46:10] <khmer> what has been found by thousands of others to be more maintainable
[22:46:27] <khmer> so why not chuck it in a fiddle and show us!
[22:46:30] <khmer> i really don't want to lead you astray
[22:46:43] <Already> khmer is probably right. It's hard to understand what you're actually doing and it feels like "well it's not a best practise"
[22:46:45] <[1]javalover> so you have newhtml = "<div>HelloWorld"</div";
[22:47:03] <khmer> [1]javalover: jsfiddle.net
[22:47:13] <[1]javalover> and you call .load() to this page   how do I then just take newhtml & idk echo it back or whatever
[22:47:48] <khmer> [1]javalover: at jsfiddle.net you can whip up a VERY quick demonstration of your problem, rather than repeatedly trying to explain it to people who can't understand you
[22:47:50] <[1]javalover> if you read what I wrote & still don't understand, we can't help each other
[22:48:09] <tw2113> you all suck at explaining your side
[22:48:23] <[1]javalover> and i'm not repeating anything, imma just dismiss the question
[22:48:29] <tw2113> and are too proud to admit it
[22:48:31] <[1]javalover> it's obvious you can't understand me
[22:48:37] <[1]javalover> fiddle won't help that
[22:48:40] <khmer> for the court i tried
[22:48:44] <tw2113> or you aren't presenting great cases for your own attempt
[22:48:47] <khmer> good luck to you son, and may you never be paid
[22:48:55] <[1]javalover> hold on a second
[22:49:00] <[1]javalover> did you have to say that last line?
[22:49:03] <[1]javalover> was that really necessary?
[22:49:40] <[1]javalover> just because we have a miscommunication you then have to attack my income?
[22:49:45] <coldhead> practice*
[22:51:02] <w00tner> jquery is cool my dear co-geekers
[22:51:50] <w00tner> i have been working with jquery for the past 3 months
[22:52:09] <w00tner> im a noobster but i have been doing some cool stuff
[22:52:29] <[1]javalover> w00tner no such thing as a noobster, only a coder
[22:52:46] <Already> javalover it's a good idea to seperate different languages. From what I've read you're using php to generate js code whcih you then want to load and execute. It might be a better idea put the code on the page and have php supply the data. You have to do the same steps just in a different way.
[22:53:20] <[1]javalover> LISTEN EVERYONE WHO HAS IDEAS AS TO HOW I SHOULD CODE, i've tried it your way, i've tried it my way, & then i've tried it the new way
[22:53:22] <jrockjiggz> [1]javalover: from what i understand from your first question, if you load HTML into your DOM, if you want to select any element, you must run a new query: $('div.class') as an example
[22:53:28] <[1]javalover> the new way is FASTER that is only reason i do it
[22:54:11] <w00tner> i have the code to loop a json file
[22:54:21] <[1]javalover> json = slow
[22:54:33] <coldhead> speed isn't everything
[22:54:40] <[1]javalover> it is when ur doing a social network
[22:54:40] <coldhead> people don't mind waiting longer for a quality product
[22:54:43] <tw2113> speed is a hell of a drug
[22:54:45] <coldhead> like single malt whiskey
[22:54:47] <w00tner> im using for a native app so its locally stored
[22:54:52] <coldhead> aged 25 years
[22:54:53] <w00tner> the little bastard is fast
[22:55:17] <Already> Faster as in faster response time for the user or faster as in less development time?
[22:55:24] <[1]javalover> jrock that's what I was doing
[22:55:31] <[1]javalover> but the guy told me I should just use .load properly
[22:55:35] <[1]javalover> so I wanted to see if there was a way...
[22:56:19] <w00tner> like 2 months ago a user from this channel recommend me:  Underscore.JS http://underscorejs.org/ to iterate into any kind of data
[22:56:19] <fonko> hey guys im brand new to jquery
[22:56:21] <[1]javalover> Already: response time for user of course
[22:56:29] <[1]javalover> ALready: development time increased by like 10
[22:56:40] <jrockjiggz> hi fonko, welcome
[22:56:49] <fonko> jrockjiggz, thanks :))
[22:56:56] <jrockjiggz> fonko: as a heads up:
[22:56:58] <jrockjiggz> ?ask @ fonko
[22:56:59] <bot-t> fonko, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:57:11] <AdamPDotty> $('fonko').welcome();
[22:57:13] <jrockjiggz> not trying to be rude, just a heads up ;)
[22:57:13] <w00tner> fonko: you are on the right track then
[22:57:19] <fonko> nice advice
[22:57:29] <fonko> sure i completly understand
[22:57:40] <fonko> im use to that in cakephp channel
[22:57:45] <jrockjiggz> cool
[22:57:54] <fonko> i mean, just ask and if i get lucky i will have an answer
[22:58:21] <Already> I haven't worked that much with JSON yet but I wonder why it would be slow. Essentially both time the data comes via ajax to the browser. But well I guess it largly depends on whatever you're doing. Having 300 ajax requests in parallel sure is slow. %) *still needs to rewrite that*
[22:58:47] <w00tner> its no slow check my app
[22:58:53] <w00tner> www.cuponaria.com/json/
[22:58:59] <w00tner> go thru categories
[22:59:04] <w00tner> is all json
[22:59:17] <fonko> so i would like to have a little guide if someone feels like helping me, i have two span tags with the price of some items... in dollars and in the country currency for the site... im showing one of those two according to what the user set in the first time (when adding the item)
[22:59:18] <w00tner> all text, images, interation
[22:59:46] <fonko> what i want to do is something like... two radio buttons, one that says dollars and one that says the other currency
[23:00:21] <fonko> if user clics one, it shows the amount in that one's currency and if he clicks the other one it will show the other currency... i already have my two values for both currency
[23:00:34] <w00tner> fonko: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/docs/forms/radiobuttons/
[23:00:38] <[1]javalover> the only reason my code is faster, is because it doesn't loop twice
[23:00:51] <fonko> w00tner, checking that right now thanks !:)
[23:00:55] <khmer> fonko: one sec!
[23:01:01] <w00tner> if you want to retrieve the data you will use: $('input[name=name]:checked').val(),
[23:01:30] <fonko> actually the data is already beeng shown, but one of those two is hiden
[23:01:44] <fonko> aah... i got it
[23:02:07] <fonko> w00tner, i understood what you said
[23:02:47] <jrockjiggz> fonko: jsfiddle is this channels primary pastie website
[23:02:50] <jrockjiggz> ?demo @fonko
[23:02:51] <bot-t> fonko, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[23:02:57] <jrockjiggz> i got you started here: http://jsfiddle.net/pLUGg/
[23:03:02] <Already> I would probably use the php code to create a json which i only need to loop once. But as I said it probably also largly depends on what you're actually doing and what you want to achieve. AFK, need to check some code.
[23:03:18] <fonko> cool guys :) let me check that
[23:03:30] <w00tner> sorry for my english, not my primary language
[23:04:22] <coldhead> no one would have guessed, w00tner, you speak like a native
[23:05:01] <w00tner> thanks, mate!
[23:05:43] <fonko> jrockjiggz, nice! actually this is better that what i am doing, since im doing my conversion from my server side... you are doin it from client's side
[23:06:04] <w00tner> jquery my friend... jquery
[23:06:14] <fonko> really awesome
[23:07:25] <khmer> fonko: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/hJjwE
[23:07:28] <jrockjiggz> fonko: a little elborated: http://jsfiddle.net/pLUGg/1/
[23:08:08] <khmer> fonko: i'm doing something a little differnt than jrockjiggz did...i'm assuming that you may have a number of currency values on a page, already calculated, and you want to display different currencies all at once
[23:08:49] <fonko> hey jrockjiggz, is there any reason why you use classes for spans and id's for buttons and outputs?
[23:08:56] <fonko> i mean, any specific reason ?
[23:08:59] <jrockjiggz> fonko: no reason
[23:09:47] <jrockjiggz> fonko: rule of thumb is, id is much faster, but class is often required
[23:09:50] <fonko> jrockjiggz, ok
[23:15:37] <fonko> jrockjiggz, i did some changes in what you gave me but its not updating
[23:15:52] <fonko> i need to refresh the page and start from scratches?
[23:15:54] <jrockjiggz> you must press 'update' at top
[23:16:02] <jrockjiggz> the URL will update
[23:16:36] <fonko> k
[23:16:54] <fonko> it didnt work... but maybe because i did something wrong (probably... im new with jquery)
[23:17:30] <jrockjiggz> see the url, is now /4  it will increase every update
[23:17:36] <jrockjiggz> it is saving
[23:17:57] <jrockjiggz> but i dont know why you deleted the javascript. lol
[23:17:58] <fonko> nice
[23:18:07] <fonko> to see if it was working
[23:18:13] <fonko> http://jsfiddle.net/KDDDp/1/
[23:18:16] <fonko> there it is
[23:18:28] <fonko> im tring to set newCurrency hiden
[23:18:57] <fonko> then when button gets submitted, show in that div this new currency
[23:19:00] <jrockjiggz> share with me when you are stuck
[23:19:09] <fonko> im am now
[23:19:10] <fonko> http://jsfiddle.net/KDDDp/1/
[23:20:56] <jrockjiggz> you need not add $(document).ready() as the code is already there in the form of: $( function() {
[23:21:54] <jrockjiggz> and, on a new fiddle, on the left side, you need to choose jQuery (default is Mootools 1.4.5
[23:22:08] <jrockjiggz> my changed: http://jsfiddle.net/KDDDp/9/
[23:22:58] <fonko> :)
[23:23:02] <fonko> i see
[23:23:26] <fonko> ok, its taking shape
[23:23:35] <fonko> but how do you do if you want to toggle from one to another?
[23:24:47] <jrockjiggz> fonko: http://jsfiddle.net/pLUGg/1/
[23:25:41] <fonko> cool jrockjiggz
[23:25:46] <fonko> let me process this :)
[23:25:53] <fonko> but thankyou very much for your help man
[23:27:40] <jrockjiggz> fonko: use this, its a better example: http://jsfiddle.net/pLUGg/5/
[23:35:14] <Myx0x3> yaay, i need to rebuild our mobile version of our site, cause the way i needed to use jquerymobile was slow, and i had an answer that would make it faster.. anyway now they desided i have to rebuild it without jquerymobile and without jquery, and we are going to use pictures on buttons, cause its probably better then CSS3.. i just love my job.
[23:36:03] <Already> Sounds like a non tech decision
[23:36:51] <Myx0x3> well, Already.. the guy who said it its pretty good at programming and he likes to write things himself, cause he know how things work.. hes a C++ programmer..
[23:37:38] <coldhead> too low level
[23:37:44] <coldhead> woods for the trees etc
[23:38:46] <Myx0x3> Already: maybe i should tell them we need to build our own version of PHP and apache, and linux.. cause we dont use all functions in php, apache and our linux dist, lol
[23:38:58] <Already> Oh I know some C++ as well. Still hmm...
[23:40:27] <Myx0x3> problem was that the mobile version was slower then our real site.. now i cant use a shit in our mobile version.. building our own jslib is problably going to be slower then jquery anyway..
[23:40:28] <Already> Best Anweser ever from a teacher: "You can't build your own hardware! You can't buy the components!" While telling use it's fine for a big company to write their own Office Suite.
[23:40:48] <Eviltwin> Myx0x3: Have you tried MooTools?
[23:41:10] <Myx0x3> Eviltwin: naah, but we probably wound use that either, "we dont know what it does"
[23:41:41] <Myx0x3> im so pissed of i cant even spell, lol
[23:41:53] <Myx0x3> off*
[23:43:09] <Myx0x3> maybe i should fix the problem even if they desided i should rewrite it
[23:45:19] <Myx0x3> well, i atleast have work for a half year forward
[23:45:31] <Myx0x3> if i have to rebuild it
[23:48:53] <anli_> Is it possible to remove the firefox internal "inspect" menu item and just have the firebug inspect?
[23:57:32] <Cork> anli_: sure, but your asking that in the wrong channel
[23:58:12] <coldhead> you're*
[23:58:38] <Myx0x3> anli_: yes its possible but wrong channel
