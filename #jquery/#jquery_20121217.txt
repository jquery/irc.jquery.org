[00:15:07] <sacrilicious> hellloooooo world
[00:15:14] <sacrilicious> 	$("#keyword").css{"width" : "400px"}.slow(); is this valid ?
[00:15:43] <xec> sacrilicious: what is .slow()? what are you trying to do?
[00:15:59] <sacrilicious> i want to increase the width of a textbox with animation
[00:16:01] <sacrilicious> slowly
[00:16:20] <xec> ?animate @ sacrilicious
[00:16:21] <bot-t> sacrilicious, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[00:16:23] <aqeel> animate() with slow property
[00:16:41] <aqeel> .slow will not increase anything
[00:17:28] <aqeel> and there is no such thing as .slow()
[00:18:08] <sacrilicious> this 	$("#keyword").css{"width" : "400px"}.animate('slow'); ?
[00:18:44] <aqeel> all available jquery stuff at a glance... sacrilicious http://jqapi.ru/
[00:20:59] <aqeel> sacrilicious: see the first example in the animate link page
[00:21:33] <sacrilicious> no animation happens when i click on the textbox $("#keyword").animate("width: 400px", "slow");
[00:22:01] <aqeel> SEE THE CODE, IN EXAMPALE
[00:23:01] <aqeel> $("#block").animate({ width: "400px" }, slow );
[00:23:45] <aqeel> $("#block").animate({ width: "400px" }, "slow" ); .......sorry left out the quotations
[00:23:51] <sacrilicious> $("#keyword").click(function() {
[00:23:51] <sacrilicious> 							$("#keyword").animate({"width": "400px"}, "slow");
[00:23:51] <sacrilicious> 						});
[00:24:11] <sacrilicious> still nothing happens
[00:24:21] <sacrilicious> it just stands there
[00:24:27] <sacrilicious> and looks at me in the eye
[00:24:31] <sacrilicious> sarcastically
[00:24:41] <aqeel> show us your fiddle
[00:24:52] <sacrilicious> i just pasted it
[00:25:28] <aqeel> not this but the entire thing as to how you are doing it
[00:25:53] <aqeel> the htmla nd all the stuff, css if included
[00:26:04] <fRAiLtY-> If I have this $('element').expander ({ slice point:450, expandText:'more..',collapseText:'less..'});
[00:26:16] <fRAiLtY-> What are the slice point, expand text and collapse text "called"
[00:26:17] <sacrilicious> http://www.rightlick.com/ its the searchbox at the top
[00:26:21] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to learn proper documentation
[00:26:26] <fRAiLtY-> And comment blocks above my code
[00:26:32] <fRAiLtY-> and I want to explain what they do
[00:26:45] <fRAiLtY-> Like you have @var myVar {string} etc
[00:27:09] <sacrilicious> fRAiLtY-: can you stop pressing enter after a few words ? its annoying :(
[00:27:27] <fRAiLtY-> lol
[00:27:30] <aqeel> or write the whole thing and enter it, not line by line
[00:31:53] <aqeel> sacrilicious: http://jsfiddle.net/Nc3mM/
[00:31:59] <aqeel> it is working the code you pasted
[00:32:22] <aqeel> click the red box
[00:33:39] <Cristen> Hi everyone, I'm trying to set a cookie using $.ajax, whenever I try to display the set cookie on another page it reads old values. Someone told me it has to do with the fact that it isn't part of the same request response and it's because I didn't reload my page. Is there a way to bypass this behavior ?
[00:35:37] <aqeel> sacrilicious: are you there?
[00:35:48] <sacrilicious> ya ya
[00:35:53] <sacrilicious> checking now
[00:37:05] <sacrilicious> aqeel: thanks a lot bro

[00:49:37] <kryl> if there isn't event defined in function(event){}... can I use a defaut for event.preventDefault ?

[00:58:59] <flat_eric> someone of u have experiences with fullcalendar?
[00:59:00] <nk> hi there. using the autocomplete of jquery-ui which works with the source data within the js-function
[00:59:15] <nk> if I return the same data as a string from an action and put that URL in the js-function it does not any more
[00:59:33] <nk> is there anything I got to pay attention to and I'm not recognizing?
[01:00:40] <nk> it's really easyy test-data like "var availTags = [{label: "foo", value:"1"}]"
[01:01:13] <nk> the same json-string return from http://foo.com/testjson and setting "var availTags = "http://foo.com/testjson" does not work any more
[01:01:21] <nk> am I misreading the api in some way?
[01:04:55] <flat_eric> fullcalendar experts?
[01:12:39] <alaing> hey ppl
[01:14:32] <alaing> I have an iframe with a <button> that submits the page within the iframe. I need to pick up when the button has been pressed from the parent document so that I can run another function that works on the parent document. any ideas how I could do this?
[01:24:14] <flat_eric> hey guys! i insert data out of my database into a div which is in a modal. in one case (in the modal-header) it works, but in the body where the other informations shall displayed it doesn't. here's my code: http://pastebin.com/g9wdAVNV , http://pastebin.com/MiKWjhiQ , http://pastebin.com/ZSnHHJBJ
[01:24:16] <flat_eric> it would be really nice if someone of you could help!
[01:32:24] <flat_eric> please someone?
[01:32:26] <flat_eric> =)
[01:33:04] <_aravind> hai
[01:33:23] <_aravind> can some one tell how to debounce autocomplete
[01:34:09] <_aravind> can some one tell how to debounce autocomplete using ui autocomplete fn
[01:34:34] <_aravind> can some one tell how to debounce autocomplete using ui autocomplete plugin
[01:53:05] <larsemil> how do i scroll to an object in a div that is scrollable?
[01:55:22] <aqeel> larsemil: welcome to my boat...
[01:56:13] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com click details, first link in menu then first link in sub menu, do test my top bar controls...
[01:56:14] <larsemil> aqeel: two to row is better then one. :D
[01:56:35] <aqeel> i have been doing scroll stuff....
[01:57:00] <aqeel> actually extending one existed plugin
[01:57:48] <aqeel> https://sites.google.com/site/danielgidmanresume/history/jquery-aautoscroll
[01:58:20] <aqeel> so what scroll you need....scroll amoothly or just a jump to the content
[01:58:26] <aqeel> smoothly*
[01:58:34] <heshanh> how do i change the message that goes inside the jquery UI dialog box?
[01:59:18] <larsemil> aqeel: just jump to content
[01:59:49] <aqeel> for that actually you need jquery simple html anchor will suffice
[01:59:49] <larsemil> aqeel: http://hinzdev.dalnix.se/aterforsaljare if you click a marker on the map it should jump to the corresponding item in the menu
[02:01:02] <heshanh> and stop the button from disappearing after its clicked
[02:03:33] <aqeel> so how is your markup for the two....the pin and the scroll
[02:05:44] <larsemil> aqeel: the pin is google maps pin. the scroll is a <li> list
[02:05:53] <larsemil> or a div containing a <ul> <li>
[02:06:16] <aqeel> have you created any reference already as a sample
[02:06:36] <aqeel> so instaed of going through entire stuff i can just focus on your problem
[02:11:25] <aqeel> well got togo...
[02:11:41] <aqeel> see you for now, will be back in say 2 to 3 hours...
[02:11:50] <aqeel> thanks room, cheers bye
[02:14:09] <larsemil> here is jsfiddle if anyone else got an idea.

[02:18:54] <seutje> larsemil: don't rly need any js for that
[02:19:07] <seutje> larsemil: http://jsfiddle.net/6j7br/6/

[02:37:23] <alaing> I have an iframe with a <button> that submits the page within the iframe. I need to pick up when the button has been pressed from the parent document so that I can run another function that works on the parent document. any ideas how I could do this?

[02:47:15] <Douglish> trinadh: If I try this using console, it reloads. Might it be different inside ajax success call?
[02:48:56] <trinadh> Douglish : I think so, try it and see, works for the page i tried  it with
[03:01:02] <shweta> hi
[03:01:11] <trinadh> fRAiLtY- : try clicking on it, which browser are you using and what does the var contain
[03:01:29] <shweta> Is http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ free plugin?
[03:03:04] <trinadh> shweta : yes, check the licence.md on github https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/blob/master/LICENSE.md
[03:11:23] <shweta> Can we use https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/blob/master/LICENSE.md in commercial projects?
[03:11:27] <shweta> free?
[03:11:33] <jonkristian_> Looking for a good and free responsive lightbox, any suggestions?
[03:15:18] <xec> shweta: you already got a "yes" and a link to the licence, why do you keep asking?
[03:18:00] <chrisbuchholz> Hey guys. Im looking for a jquery plugin that allows me to, say in a list of li's, replace two li's with a nice transition animation. Any ideas of a plugin that allows this?
[03:19:02] <gryffus> hello, i need to customize jw-player so it pauses nivo-slider while playing video. Is here someone who can help me with that? I can stop the slider by "jQuery('#slider').data('nivoslider').stop();" and start it by "jQuery(#slider').data('nivoslider').start()" but i dont know where to put these lines... The jw player source is here: http://developer.longtailvideo.com/trac/browser/trunk/jw6/jwplayer.js anyone?
[03:33:56] <ciphergoth> I can't seem to find the documentation for the "fail" method on the object returned by $.ajax()
[03:34:35] <fulminator>  hello, I have an array  variable in my js file. Is there a posibility to add (push) items in that array from a textbox with a button click event? But this means permanently, actually, the js file would modify itself, next time when open the html page, those items to be saved in that array?
[03:35:00] <ciphergoth> I know that "error" is deprecated and "fail" is the new way, but where can I learn more about the new way?
[03:35:36] <ciphergoth> I've looked for every instance of the word "fail" on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ but it doesn't seem to tell me what I should be passing to jqXHR.fail()
[03:36:06] <Haprog_> ciphergoth: yes it does. you pass it a function. there's even an example
[03:36:17] <ciphergoth> Haprog_: that function has no arguments
[03:36:21] <ciphergoth> in the example
[03:36:25] <Haprog_> yes it has
[03:36:29] <Haprog_> request.fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus) {...
[03:36:49] <Haprog_> 10th occurence of word fail on the page
[03:36:55] <gryffus> hello, i need to customize jw-player so it pauses nivo-slider while playing video. Is here someone who can help me with that? I can stop the slider by "jQuery('#slider').data('nivoslider').stop();" and start it by "jQuery(#slider').data('nivoslider').start()" but i dont know where to put these lines... The jw player source is here: http://developer.longtailvideo.com/trac/browser/trunk/jw6/jwplayer.js anyone?
[03:37:29] <ciphergoth> ah there's a second example, but nothing that explicitly states what the interface is
[03:37:57] <ciphergoth> something called "textStatus"
[03:38:15] <Haprog_> true. the doc could be a bit better.
[03:39:04] <ciphergoth> don't I get the whole response? Just the textStatus?
[03:39:14] <ciphergoth> or does the jqXHR know the response?
[03:39:34] <Haprog> hmm I'm not sure but I think fail() would work exactly like error() idd.
[03:39:39] <Haprog> error is better documented on the page
[03:39:45] <Haprog> *did
[03:39:48] <ciphergoth> ah right
[03:40:04] <Haprog> error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[03:40:05] <ciphergoth> had assumed they'd be different since why elese change the name?
[03:40:17] <Haprog> I dunno
[03:40:52] <ciphergoth> huh
[03:41:05] <ciphergoth> OK will just check for "timeout" and keep my fingers crossed!
[03:52:40] <ravenz> any idea why I have [<a>, prevObject: v.fn.v.init[1], context: #document, selector: "[href="#helper_jobskills"].slice(0,1)"]
[03:52:45] <ravenz> slice(0,1) ?
[03:53:03] <ravenz> on console.debug
[03:54:00] <yousaf> This works on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/7T2fL/39/ but not on the live site, any reason?
[03:54:00] <ravenz> is it a question for jquery-dev ?
[03:56:38] <gryffus> hello, i need to customize jw-player so it pauses nivo-slider while playing video. Is here someone who can help me with that? I can stop the slider by "jQuery('#slider').data('nivoslider').stop();" and start it by "jQuery(#slider').data('nivoslider').start()" but i dont know where to put these lines... The jw player source is here: http://developer.longtailvideo.com/trac/browser/trunk/jw6/jwplayer.js anyone?
[03:57:19] <shoky> ravenz: what about it?
[03:58:22] <yousaf> anyone?
[03:59:17] <shoky> ravenz: it's probably the result  of doing .first() or .eq(0) or smth
[03:59:20] <ravenz> dunno, it is what I get when I console.debug() this jquery object (Selection
[03:59:27] <ravenz> shoky it is
[03:59:29] <shoky> ravenz: so ?
[04:00:10] <ravenz> I just looks weird to see slice(0,1) in the selector value
[04:00:24] <shoky> ravenz: it's an internal jquery field. it's not supposed to look pretty
[04:01:17] <shoky> though it looks pretty pretty to me ;p
[04:01:45] <trinadh> yousaf: what doesn't work.. slide?
[04:01:55] <ravenz> it is not about that.. I suppose that $(foo).selector
[04:02:03] <ravenz> won't work then
[04:02:09] <shoky> $(foo).selector  ? huh
[04:02:39] <shoky> it's not a real selector string, if that's what you're asking
[04:02:52] <yousaf> trinadh yes it doesn't toggle/slide
[04:03:11] <ravenz> shoky yeah ok, nvm
[04:03:16] <shoky> ravenz: oh you mean accessing that field?  it'll work.. that doesn't mean it's not internal
[04:03:40] <ravenz> I can access it but don't use it I guess
[04:04:12] <shoky> don't see how you'd use it other than for debugging
[04:04:44] <ravenz> just saying, I don't need it... out of curiosity you know
[04:06:12] <shoky> yahp
[04:09:46] <ciphergoth> OK this is my ignorance, but I thought that if I did $("#form").submit(function(){ ... return false}) then the form wouldn't be sent
[04:10:11] <trinadh> yousaf: any link to live site, do check if it is all the same i.e. something is not missed..
[04:10:15] <ciphergoth> so I could do $.post("/ajax/putmsg", $("#form").serialize()) and the browser wouldn't try to actually load a page as a result of the form submission
[04:10:54] <gryffus> anyone?
[04:11:16] <shoky> ciphergoth:  better to do  $("#form").submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); ... })  and what you said is right..
[04:11:29] <ciphergoth> ah brilliant, preventDefault, thanks
[04:11:33] <yousaf> trinadh can I PM you the link?
[04:11:43] <shoky> ciphergoth: but it should usually work with return false too
[04:11:54] <ciphergoth> shoky: sounds like there's still a mystery on why what I'm doing isn't working, but i can work around it. Thanks!
[04:12:15] <shoky> yah, would need to see more code
[04:12:50] <ciphergoth> oh I'm doing $("#form").reset() inside the submit()
[04:12:58] <ciphergoth> maybe that could break it?
[04:13:08] <shoky> that would reset the form. not submit it :P
[04:13:17] <shoky> hm
[04:13:18] <trinadh> yousaf: ok..
[04:13:30] <ciphergoth> well sure :) but maybe it breaks the effect of "return false"
[04:13:32] <shoky> ciphergoth: actually you can't do $('#form').reset()
[04:13:45] <ciphergoth> shoky: it appears to work
[04:13:47] <shoky> ciphergoth: that should give you an error in your console
[04:14:03] <ciphergoth> *checks* not so far, will doubel check
[04:14:23] <ciphergoth> ah it does
[04:14:27] <ciphergoth> odd that I didn't see it before
[04:14:45] <ciphergoth> I guess it appeared to work because I was submitting the form, which cleared it!
[04:14:53] <ciphergoth> so what's the right thing to do there?
[04:15:44] <shoky> $('#form')[0].reset()
[04:16:15] <shoky> wll
[04:16:25] <shoky> probably  just:  this.reset()  will do fine
[04:16:34] <shoky> inside the submit handler
[04:17:03] <shoky> and you can use $(this) inside instead of $('#form')
[04:17:43] <ciphergoth> shoky: and indeed, this.reset() works - thank you!
[04:22:25] <yousaf> trinadh?
[04:23:04] <ciphergoth> aaargh how do I tell a 503 error from other error codes? The textStatus is just "error"
[04:28:40] <yousaf> Can someone please help?
[04:28:59] <aneki> we can try
[04:29:02] <aneki> whats yr issue
[04:29:22] <yousaf> This works fine http://jsfiddle.net/vMLeV/ on jsfiddle but not on the live site
[04:29:33] <yousaf> it doesn't toggle on the live site
[04:29:42] <aneki> got a link to live site?
[04:30:04] <yousaf> yep http://www.perry-company.co.uk/
[04:31:07] <shoky> yousaf: there's an invisible invalid character at the end of your javascript
[04:31:15] <shoky> yousaf: if you look in your console you'll see the error
[04:31:16] <aneki> shoky++
[04:31:26] <aneki> 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL '
[04:31:26] <shoky> yousaf: it happens when you copy&paste from jsfiddle
[04:32:16] <yousaf> hmm i got rid of it?
[04:32:31] <shoky> yousaf: delete the last lines and characters of the script
[04:32:46] <shoky> yousaf: and rewrite them if needed
[04:34:06] <yousaf> ok completely removed the relevant js
[04:34:44] <aneki> u also have some 404's on some assets
[04:34:45] <aneki> fonts
[04:34:59] <yousaf> yeh that is the next battle :)
[04:35:06] <yousaf> they are there, if you click on them in the console
[04:35:20] <aneki> so they are
[04:35:21] <aneki> thats odd
[04:36:52] <yousaf> rewrote the code still no luck shoky
[04:37:44] <shoky> yousaf: your code isn't in a $(document).ready(...)
[04:37:52] <trinadh> yousaf: replace $ with jQuery
[04:38:01] <shoky> nah
[04:38:49] <trinadh> place the code in jQuery(document.ready() , which is laready present just a couple of lines above
[04:38:50] <yousaf> oh dear that works
[04:39:05] <yousaf> but the styling is shocking for some reason
[04:40:25] <shoky> you have a fixed height for #branchlis
[04:40:28] <shoky> you have a fixed height for #branchlist
[04:40:42] <shoky> and #rectangle-list is a child of #branchlist
[04:41:09] <shoky> so when you show #rectangle-list, it's overflowing the fixed height of #branchlist
[04:42:09] <shoky> yousaf: maybe change the height: 35px  to  min-height: 35px
[04:42:09] <yousaf> that is fixed but i still get the numbering with odd styling
[04:42:29] <yousaf> shoky i removed height completely
[04:42:31] <shoky> k
[04:43:16] <yousaf> shoky why doesn't it look like the one on jsfiddle?
[04:43:29] <yousaf> I don't have any other styling for ordered lists
[04:43:47] <AL13N_work> i'm using $(doc1_elements).add($(doc2_elements)) but it seems that the order of resulting elements is undefined... somtimes doc1 first and sometimes doc2 first...
[04:43:59] <AL13N_work> how can i make sure doc1 will be before doc2?
[04:46:26] <trinadh> yousaf: ol { list-style-type : none; }  if that is what you are saying
[04:48:47] <shoky> yousaf: you have that <span class="normal"> Perrys   crap
[04:48:52] <shoky> yousaf: that's not in the fiddle..
[04:49:01] <yousaf> shoky I don't know where that is coming from
[04:50:14] <yousaf> if you look, its not in the actual source
[04:50:53] <shoky> yousaf: functions.js
[04:51:17] <yousaf> hmm why would they do that? it is something to do with responsive?
[04:51:31] <shoky> they?
[04:51:38] <shoky> i dont know wordpress sry.
[04:51:51] <yousaf> I haven't built the site, someone else has
[04:52:02] <shoky> then ask them..?
[04:52:11] <shoky> $('.entry ol > li').wrapInner('<span class="normal"/>');
[04:53:50] <yousaf> hmm weird
[04:53:56] <yousaf> thanks for your help Shoky
[04:54:05] <shoky> np
[04:54:10] <yousaf> i will probably need to email them to find out what that is about
[04:55:23] <yousaf> Now i got to find out why there is crazy margin between each item in the list
[04:55:46] <aneki> link?
[04:55:54] <yousaf> http://www.perry-company.co.uk/
[04:56:39] <shoky> yousaf because of the span
[04:56:56] <shoky> #branchlist span { margin-left: 1em; }
[04:56:59] <shoky> er
[04:57:10] <shoky> that explains the left margin at least ;S
[04:58:33] <AL13N_work> should i use .pushStack() instead of .add() ? if i want to ensure order?
[04:58:48] <AL13N_work> or is it an 'array' and can i just use .push() ?
[04:59:29] <yousaf> ok that is fixed but i need to find out why they have that code in functions.js in the first place
[05:04:31] <shoky> AL13N_work: pushStack doesn't add things
[05:04:41] <yousaf> Shoky last question, i promise :) if you click on "view our offices" when the toggle jumps at the end of animation, is this normal?
[05:04:56] <shoky> AL13N_work: and .push is native javascript so i don't think it's safe to use on a jquery object and get a jquery object out of it.. donno
[05:05:22] <shoky> AL13N_work:  you can .push to a normal array though and then  $(myArray)
[05:07:42] <shoky> yousaf: try putting overflow:hidden on the <ol>
[05:08:21] <AL13N_work> shoky: i'll try
[05:11:43] <AL13N_work> shoky: thanks 10/10 the order is now correct :-)
[05:11:53] <inad923> hello
[05:12:08] <inad923> I have 2 elements in a div in a given order. How can I swap their order?
[05:13:58] <shoky> inad923: many ways..  one way:   var div = $('#myDiv');  div.append( div.children().first() )
[05:21:38] <BulleTime> hey guys, anyone knows how to get the absolute offset of a div. Its always returning zero..
[05:22:25] <BulleTime> i need to know its offset to check what div is creating a scrollbar on x
[05:22:48] <BulleTime> offset() always returns zero?
[05:23:04] <BulleTime> even within $(window).load()
[05:23:04] <Scarius> Hi all
[05:24:19] <Scarius> is here anyone who can tell me how to reveal a canvas or img on hover?
[05:26:47] <Guest23086> jquery rules
[05:28:32] <inad923> if I have a reference to a div(jquery) element and I have a variable n assigned to a number how can I get the nTh child of the element with jquery?
[05:30:37] <Scarius> A VERY HELPFUL BUNCH O PPL HERE :s
[05:31:18] <shoky> inad923:  .children()  and .eq()  could work
[05:31:53] <shoky> inad923: also .find()  and :nth-child selector
[05:32:24] <inad923> shoky: Thanks. Sorry for the stupid questions but I'm quite new to this.
[05:32:43] <shoky> inad923: then start browsing http://api.jquery.com

[05:53:39] <geiregjo> Greetings
[05:54:14] <geiregjo> I'm having an IOS issue with jQuery mobile. It seems that after a taphold a mouseup and mousedown event is triggered.
[05:54:23] <geiregjo> Mouseup makes sense but the mousedown doesn't
[05:56:45] <geiregjo> Is this a known issue? I don't find a lot of info about it...
[06:06:07] <yousaf> shoky thank you :)
[06:09:52] <yousaf> how can I change the "view our office" text to something else when its toggled? http://jsfiddle.net/HzbEF/
[06:10:53] <NodeX> what about when it toggles back ?
[06:11:07] <yousaf> back to "view our office"
[06:11:34] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/HzbEF/1/
[06:11:42] <yousaf> Basically I want to have "+ View our offices" by default, when its toggled i want "- View our offices"
[06:12:05] <NodeX> then you need to do somehting different

[06:23:12] <computer2000> how can i get the mobile safari inner height without the status/address bar?
[06:23:38] <computer2000> or, how do i get the mobile safari address bar height?
[06:41:25] <DarsVaeda> how do I output browser and version?
[06:41:55] <pachet> window.navigator.userAgent
[06:42:19] <DarsVaeda> I know but that does not give me the browser itself
[06:42:39] <DarsVaeda> and there are so many different possibilities
[06:42:41] <pachet> javascript knows only what it is told
[06:42:49] <tra> DarsVaeda: what do you want to do?
[06:42:54] <pachet> and browsers have a penchant for lying
[06:43:07] <DarsVaeda> output the name of the browser and the version
[06:43:13] <tra> useragent cant be trusted anyways
[06:43:52] <DarsVaeda> it is for users that can not find out their browser and version, I guess those are not able to change the agent anyway
[06:44:09] <tra> DarsVaeda: have checked out jQuery.browser ?
[06:44:13] <DarsVaeda> yes
[06:44:36] <tra> it uses navigator.userAgent so...
[06:44:59] <DarsVaeda> yes but it gives that I have "mozilla: true" and the version
[06:45:11] <DarsVaeda> not much of use
[06:45:34] <DarsVaeda> so I'm up to parse the useragent myself I guess? -.-
[06:45:40] <tra> well it tells you that it is a mozilla and it's version. for what do you need the info?
[06:46:22] <DarsVaeda> bug hunting
[06:47:06] <tra> DarsVaeda: maybe this could help you http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8754080/how-to-get-exact-browser-name-and-version
[06:47:22] <tra> but as said, you can't trust userAgent
[07:15:11] <computer2000> pls help, i want to insert "<span>" into another element, but without closing it, jquery seems to automatically add a closing tag also
[07:16:29] <wolfehr> computer2000, isn't your element already closed when query manipulates it?
[07:17:18] <computer2000> wolfehr: i am doing $('#myDiv').prepend('<span>'); but jquery prepends '<span></span>' ... i only need the opening part, without closing it
[07:19:06] <wolfehr> computer2000, you want to wrap something in the span?
[07:19:16] <computer2000> wolfehr: yes
[07:19:27] <computer2000> but dont need the wrap() function
[07:20:42] <wolfehr> how comes you already have the closing span around the element? Sounds like something might be a little broken somewhere
[07:21:10] <wolfehr> (more specifically sounds like malformed html)
[07:23:43] <computer2000> wolfehr: i need to wrap something which isnt selectable by jquery selectors, so i need to place the opening/closing tags myself around it
[07:24:05] <computer2000> wolfehr: more exactly, i need to wrap a certain part of some text
[07:24:12] <wolfehr> how isn't is selectable via a jquery selector?
[07:24:29] <wolfehr> do you have a paste bin of the sample html?
[07:24:32] <computer2000> wolfehr: because its just text inside a div, and i need to select just a part of it
[07:25:19] <computer2000> i need to select word one until word 100 ...
[07:25:46] <wolfehr> you could iterate through those and assign it to a var, then append that to a new jQuery element, then append that into the dom
[07:27:39] <Goose1984> I have the following jQuery('#menu li').has('ul').addClass('has-child')
[07:28:01] <Goose1984> How to add a class to those li's which dont have a ul
[07:28:09] <Goose1984> is the question
[07:30:04] <wolfehr> do they have an ol instead, or are they completely orphaned?
[07:30:21] <saeztg> Suppose there is an eventhandler E1 for event E bound to an element 'elem'. Can I write an E2 to bind to 'elem' to capture E and then call E1 ?
[07:31:27] <Goose1984> I basically want to add a class "has-child" or "no-child" depending on if the li has any ul (children) inside it
[07:33:43] <wolfehr> $('#menu li').not('.has-child') would do it after you'd given them has-child
[07:34:00] <pachet> Goose1984: var setOfLis = $('#menu li'); setOfLis.not(setOfLis.has('ul').addClass('has-child')).addClass('no-child');
[07:34:19] <katsh> http://jsfiddle.net/EeZ56/ i am trying to get the text() of .lp-name.. but my traversal is broken somewhere
[07:34:42] <katsh> am i supposed to be traversing to the parent, to find the sibling?
[07:37:11] <computer2000> pls help: i need to wrap some text until a specific element appears... i dont know how to make the selector, so i could use wrap() or something similiar... anyone can help?
[07:37:28] <katsh> K so i found my solution with this:  t = $(this).parents('.thumb-inner').next('.lp-name').text()
[07:37:39] <katsh> but seems like more work than it should be
[07:37:46] <Goose1984> Thanks
[07:40:05] <aqeel> hi room
[07:40:32] <untaken> can getJSON return something, the actual method that is?
[07:40:46] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/keRD6/
[07:41:28] <aqeel> i would like to optimize the code, say combine the two methods
[07:42:07] <aqeel> ehrtr it takes to arguments one toend and second for direction....either 0 or e.prop()
[07:42:56] <aqeel> since the two are very common in nture
[07:43:17] <aqeel> nature*
[07:47:01] <aqeel> anyone in the room
[07:47:44] <trinadh> aqueel: check if this works.. http://jsfiddle.net/keRD6/1/
[07:49:57] <trinadh> katsh: doesnt $('.lp-name').text() works?
[07:51:09] <lxsameer> is it possible to build jquery from source and just include parts that i needed ?
[07:55:25] <trinadh> @lxsameer https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[07:55:44] <lxsameer> trinadh: thanks
[07:56:30] <aqeel> trinadh: thanks, but i would like to ask, this asks for one input top and states two condition, true else false....can i make it more precise like top = 0 and bottom = $(this).prop()...thus i can give the arguments as top or bottom and gets the direction accordingly
[07:57:25] <trinadh> aqueel: try if else if
[07:57:43] <aqeel> something like $("element").autoscroll("toend","top")....second part is the method
[08:00:33] <aqeel> wait let me fiddle my concept

[08:03:57] <trinadh> computer2000: may be get entire text into variable, split it to array, iterate , add span tag, combine everything into string
[08:05:00] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/keRD6/2/
[08:05:04] <pachet> no need to iterate

[08:07:36] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/zgSF6/1/
[08:08:25] <aqeel> as of now it is functional....elelment.autoscroll("totop"); and elelment.autoscroll("tobottom");
[08:08:46] <faraway> hlve: should be $('[name*="UserName"]')
[08:08:51] <aqeel> i want to make a common one function where it takes arguments like this...
[08:09:26] <aqeel> elelment.autoscroll("toend","totop"); or elelment.autoscroll("toend","tobottom");
[08:09:33] <faraway> hlve: without the quotes you have an array with on element that contains the result of name*="UserName" ;)

[08:12:08] <gad2103> i am having some trouble with jquery mobile

[08:12:54] <gad2103> ok. thanks so much!
[08:13:05] <hlve> faraway, i'm sure this is going to get complicated, but basically this form has an option to add more users, which I need to post to an API. Is there any way to take this code, and count how many inputs that contain the name UserName, and create variables for all of them so it's easier for me to post their values?
[08:13:06] <hlve> lol
[08:13:51] <gad2103> hello everyone. i am having some page navigation issues regarding elements not initializing. can somebody help pleeeeeeze?!

[08:14:29] <aqeel> trinadh: any luck?
[08:16:24] <faraway> hlve: not sure i understand you right, but you could do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/gjcUP/2/
[08:16:43] <aqeel> trinadh: yup
[08:18:01] <hlve> faraway, so the name would then become the variable automatically
[08:18:03] <hlve> Hm
[08:18:08] <hlve> I like the way you think :)
[08:18:41] <hlve> thank you very much for your help
[08:20:59] <jeremy-> I'm trying to add a jquery plugin to my datatable (which is initialised with .colorpicker() in the document ready portion). I've noticed its not working, and I'm assuming its because the colorpicker is trying to initialise before datatables gets its data with sajaxsource
[08:21:08] <jeremy-> I found 2 workarounds for other things, either using the inbuild API for datatables to do things
[08:21:26] <jeremy-> or for instance with click, I could add .live('click', function()
[08:21:50] <jeremy-> Any ideas for applying the colorpicker jquery?
[08:22:20] <faraway> hlve: but probably http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ will be sufficient for you. it really depends on what you want to achive
[08:23:06] <gad2103> i have a function that is creating a list and then appending to a ul and then calling change page to that page after. the first time it is called everything works correctly. the second time it is called the theme doesn't seem to apply and the buttons show up as blue links. i thought that change page would cause jqm to initialize the elemnts on the page again. the function that creates the list is inside the pageinit event
[08:23:55] <hlve> faraway, it's a pretty messy form tbh. We're integrating an API post to all form posts. This form in paticular gives account holders the ability to add multiple users, all of which need to be posted to the API.
[08:24:25] <hlve> So, if a account holder wants to add 3 users, there is going to be 3 sets of 3 inputs (name, phone, and email) that need to be posted.
[08:27:17] <jeremy-> nvm, 20th google search a charm, fnDrawCallback does the trick

[08:29:49] <amcsi_work> hello
[08:30:06] <amcsi_work> how do I test for if a browser supports the nth-child(odd) css selector?
[08:30:34] <aqeel_> trinadh: if you see the link, some methods take two arguments
[08:38:58] <BillCriswell> amcsi_work: You can test a property on an odd child with jQuery to see if it's applied.
[08:39:32] <BillCriswell> amcsi_work: Might be easier to just have jQuery add a class, though.
[08:39:50] <Brodingo> could also write a modernizr detect
[08:40:55] <BillCriswell> amcsi_work: It works on IE9 and up if that helps your decision.
[08:41:10] <hlve> BillCriswell, y u so smart :P
[08:41:10] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[08:41:34] <BillCriswell> Is b-ot possessed?

[08:50:08] <hugo_moss> how can you disable zooming past a certain percentage in a browser?
[08:50:49] <systemfault> I don't think you can..
[08:51:36] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: I'm very relived you can't.
[08:53:18] <aqeel_> trinadh: yeah it is me
[08:54:08] <hugo_moss> BillCriswell: i have some zoom issue only in chrome past 50%, works in all other browsers
[08:54:33] <hugo_moss> text overflows the div and doesn't change font size when zooming out
[08:54:49] <hugo_moss> probably some rounding errors
[08:56:05] <hugo_moss> doesnt work in webkit browsers

[08:59:05] <faraway> hugo_moss: it is about ui element ... but probably similar to webpages ... i know there is another page about minimum font size .. but i don't have it in the bookmarks right here
[09:03:40] <zubelgenubi> having a problem with jquery mobile multi-pages - dialog wont pop up, sometimes.    How to diagnose???
[09:07:28] <stkrzysiak> hey guys, new to the chan, so forgive me for jumping into asking for help.  however, this isn't help but curiousity as I've resolved my original issue.
[09:08:24] <stkrzysiak> anyway, i was trying to remove a colon from form element labels, and my js would break checkbox elements when i did a str replace on an element's(label) .text()
[09:08:38] <stkrzysiak> but when I change the .text() to a .html(), it works perfect
[09:09:12] <stkrzysiak> my reading of the jquery api hasn't turned up anything, anyone know why .text may cause that behavior?
[09:10:52] <stkrzysiak> so $('label').each(function() { $(this).html(this.html().replace(\:\, ''))});
[09:12:19] <gad2103> hello, just posting again. i'm having trouble with page navigation in JQM. i'm submitting a form, then calling a function to append form data to a list on a different internal page's content, and then changePage to that page. first time i do it, it works fine. second time the content isn't themed anymore and the links are broken. any help would be greatly appreciated!
[09:12:37] <level09> I want to use an <a> element to slide something, what should I set the href to ?
[09:12:56] <level09> should I just set it to '#' and then return false?
[09:15:34] <stkrzysiak> level09 javascript=void(0)
[09:15:50] <stkrzysiak> check that syntax though, cant remember off the top of my head
[09:16:34] <level09> what difference does that make ? is there a benefit from using that ?
[09:17:06] <Jon471> stkrzysiak: are you sure it works with html?  http://jsfiddle.net/WqV2b/
[09:17:16] <stkrzysiak> level09, there's a good thread on it on stackoverflow, don't have it on me right now, and i was wrong.
[09:17:33] <stkrzysiak> set your class to arbitrary name
[09:17:42] <level09> will try to find that , thanks
[09:17:50] <stkrzysiak> dont use js void way.  setting hrefs that do nothing is frowned upon
[09:18:01] <stkrzysiak> so <a class='mydiv'>
[09:18:09] <level09> aha
[09:18:13] <level09> that looks better
[09:18:16] <stkrzysiak> and trigger on that being clicked, Jon471, looking now
[09:20:04] <stkrzysiak> Jon471, typed it out wrong a bit, the regex doesnt seem to work so switch to ':'
[09:20:06] <stkrzysiak> see fiddle
[09:20:16] <stkrzysiak> and i should have fiddled this :p\
[09:20:20] <stkrzysiak> (thanks)
[09:20:41] <Jon471> stkrzysiak: I think the key problem here is that "this" inside the html function is not a jquery object, it should be a DOM element i believe
[09:21:15] <Jon471> e.g. this would work: $(this).html( this.outerHTML.replace(/:/, '') );
[09:21:24] <stkrzysiak> Jon471, interesting.  yeah, when i switched to text on fiddle it broke nicely :)
[09:22:11] <stkrzysiak> i switch the this in the html to a jquery one, still same difference, but you may be on to something?
[09:22:19] <Jon471> it's all about encoding
[09:22:42] <Jon471> the text function will html encode it so it can be represented as text in a browser
[09:22:58] <stkrzysiak> ah, i see
[09:23:00] <Jon471> html function will get it raw, so it can be parsed as html
[09:23:24] <Jon471> this works: http://jsfiddle.net/WqV2b/3/
[09:23:45] <Jon471> (as well as your example)
[09:25:30] * hlve slaps \mSg around a bit with a large trout
[09:25:58] <hlve> ugh
[09:27:26] <hlve> o_o...
[09:28:01] <jacobroufa> wow...
[09:30:06] <hlve> Any ops aroundt o ban him until he fixes it?
[09:30:07] <hlve> lol
[09:30:53] <hlve> oh hey there ajpiano.
[09:31:06] <hlve> tyvm :P
[09:31:17] <hlve> wonder what happened to his client
[09:31:25] <ajpiano> happens all the time
[09:31:50] <jeremy-> I think there is a chan setting so you cant rejoin so often
[09:31:59] <BazBC> if I have 5 elements that match "div.alpha" and want to eliminate them from my selection (but not from the DOM) where they also match "div.alpha.bravo" is there a convenient syntax I'm not aware of?
[09:32:08] * hlve dances
[09:33:30] <BazBC> feel like I'm missing something quite obvious. Tried "div.alpha[class!="bravo"]" but that A) doesn't work B) seems wrong and ugly anyway
[09:33:45] <jeremy-> $("#id div:not(#otherid).hide();
[09:33:50] <jeremy-> that kinda thing
[09:33:55] <jeremy-> look up the "not"
[09:34:08] <BazBC> yeah I tried that, my syntax must have been wrong. I'll try again - thanks
[09:34:11] <jeremy-> pretty sure you could just hide everything, then show the one you need though, dont even need that kinda complicated selector
[09:34:44] <danzik17> BazBC: $( "div.alpha" ).not( ".bravo" )
[09:35:00] <jeremy-> yeh, i copied and pasted and didnt remove the id, you get the idea
[09:35:08] <BazBC> ah .. didn't no not() was a method in its own right, I thought it had to be used as jeremy wrote - inside a query
[09:35:18] <stkrzysiak> good stuff, thanks Jon471
[09:35:28] <BazBC> excellente - thanks both
[09:35:44] <jeremy-> i think it works both ways, at least i've only used it the way i wrote it
[09:36:18] <BazBC> yeah I tried :not() in a query, but perhaps because it followed a chain of classes it failed ... at any rate, got a working solution now. Thanks!
[10:07:14] <tlkr> I am using jqueryui tabs, I need to be run a handler on page load where a tab is defined using the uri hash tag. I have tried activate/beforeActivate and show, they all seem to work when manually selecting a tab but not on page load.
[10:07:25] <tlkr> it does select the tab however from the hashtag
[10:08:17] <mcnesium> is there actually a specified rule on where to use '' and "" quotes? they seem to be set randomly in the examples: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[10:09:00] <tlkr> Never mind I figured it out, need to use the create event
[10:12:01] <shoky> mcnesium: there is no rule
[10:12:26] <mcnesium> thats what i thought
[10:12:49] <mcnesium> just wondering why even on the jquery docs page there is such a clutter :D
[10:14:24] <shoky> "that's how it ended up" suits me just fine ;p
[10:15:08] <mcnesium> i keep trying to use "" for html and '' for js
[10:15:39] <jones__> hi.. what should i change here to hide the second span and make it work fine http://jsfiddle.net/evilcelery/4XZMb/
[10:26:57] <jones__> ?
[10:30:58] <Absolute0> If I have two jquery objects (a = $('a'); b=$('b')), can I combine them to call a function on both at the same time ($(a, b).foo())? The multiple selector in the docs only seems to support strings.
[10:31:25] <Kambfhase> .add
[10:31:36] <Kambfhase> ?add @ Absolute0
[10:31:37] <bot-t> Absolute0, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[10:32:07] <Absolute0> is that in place?
[10:32:28] <Absolute0> does it modify all subsequent calls as well?
[10:33:12] <Kambfhase> $('a').add($('b')).hide().show()
[10:33:21] <Kambfhase> that works

[11:11:46] <erisco> I am using jquery 1.8.3. A plugin adds itself to jQuery using $.fn.lightbox_me = function(options) { ... but $("#someid").lightbox_me() errors with Object has no method 'lightbox_me'
[11:11:58] <erisco> jQuery is linked before the plugin
[11:13:03] <systemfault> Perhaps you're including jQuery again lower in that same page
[11:14:37] <ravenzz> or wait until the dom is ready
[11:16:54] <danfromuk> Hi, is there a good jquery based file uploader?
[11:19:43] <frantz> Is anyone familiar with turning click events into swipe events?
[11:19:59] <frantz> We have an image gallery that we need to have left an right clicks turn into left/rigth swipes when on ipad/iphone
[11:22:10] <ben_q> hello, how can I run a function, which uses document.write, inside an element, so that it will write inside that element? all attempts so far cause the function to execute on the entire document and thus overwriting the website :D
[11:22:26] <Kambfhase> never ever use document.write
[11:22:38] <ben_q> it's the font colour picker of phpBB board
[11:22:44] <ben_q> it's written this way
[11:23:03] <Kambfhase> well, you cant limit doc.write to an element
[11:23:14] <Kambfhase> it is designed to rewrite the shole document
[11:23:28] <Gho5t> frantz: you'll just have to update it to bind to the touch events
[11:23:42] <ben_q> but how is the function working then? it's calling colourpalette() and without ajax it's displaying properly..
[11:23:47] <chrisr> I want to become a better JS programmer.  Currently my javascript scripts mainly consist of just linking certain events of objects directly to functions, and that's it.  I don't create my own objects/classes or anything fany.  It's not particularly pretty but it works.  What's the best thing to do?
[11:23:52] <Kambfhase> you could, however, overwrite doc.write and do some innerHTML magic.
[11:24:13] <chrisr>  : /fan/fancy
[11:24:26] <frantz> so basically just bind click events to touch?
[11:25:41] <Gho5t> no
[11:25:44] <ben_q> Kambfhase, this is working inside the element though: http://pastebin.com/WDB3VAZT  that's the original code. which I try to get running when loading this code via ajax
[11:26:17] <ben_q> oh wait
[11:26:18] <Gho5t> frantz: whatever the object is $('.left').click(function() should also be $('.left').bind('ontouchstart"0
[11:26:29] <Gho5t> or whatever the events are called for ios
[11:26:31] <ben_q> that's not the doc.write thing
[11:26:43] <frantz> ahh gotcha
[11:26:47] <frantz> thanks
[11:26:52] <Gho5t> sure np
[11:27:02] <fulminator> hello, I am building a personal-use offline app with html5 and jquery for my android phone. I have a simple button input that is selected and added a .click() event. However, the click event does not work. I am missing something here? please help
[11:27:12] <erisco> ravenzz, I am calling lightbox_me in a click callback, so dom is ready
[11:27:44] <ravenzz> do you have a link?
[11:28:09] <erisco> ravenzz, no, sorry, but I can put something together
[11:28:26] <ravenzz> that would be awesome
[11:28:41] <ravenzz> jsfiddle.net
[11:31:08] <erisco> the ridiculous thing is that $.fn.lightbox_me is undefined
[11:31:12] <wachpwnski> I keep getting this for my ajax request:  XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://10.55.56.61:8000/. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[11:31:19] <erisco> like it is being writ over
[11:31:34] <wachpwnski> What is it that I can possibly be doing wrong?
[11:32:12] <wachpwnski> Are you declaring jquery twice or lightbox before jquery?
[11:32:26] <erisco> no
[11:33:24] <mscharf> Hi all. Sorry if I interrupt here, but I was wondering what does the e mean when used in this context: .click(function(e){ //stuff }
[11:34:10] <erisco> if I write console.log($.fn.lightbox_me) before the dom loads, lightbox_me is defined
[11:34:15] <mscharf> It is usually followed by e.preventDefault();
[11:34:22] <erisco> but in the dom loaded handler, it is undefined
[11:36:52] <erisco> jQuery was being included twice -.- sorry, it was heavily obfuscated
[11:37:02] <erisco> thanks for the idea
[11:38:13] <frantz> So this is my code for our image carousel's prev/next buttons http://jsfiddle.net/N8jBw/ -- here is the carousel itself in action http://d.perich.com/grand-hotel/april-2012/the-hotel#72157623428872151&7138770083 you may need to click on the image to get the gallery to pop up, but I'm having issues getting that next/prev to be "swipeabe" on ipad/iphone still
[11:45:48] <jonez> greetings. I have a small piece of js that uses .getJSON. I have checked and I do get a response. my next step is to populate a form field based on part of the response from the AJAX. I've tried $("#city).val = ... and .html= ... with no luck. any clues? :)
[11:46:13] <andrew9184> jonez, are you putting it in the callback ?
[11:46:19] <jonez> ya
[11:46:30] <jonez> I can pastebin the js I have if that is helpful.
[11:46:43] <jonez> the function I made hooks to the onblur() event
[11:47:16] <fulminator> hello, I am building a personal-use offline app with html5 and jquery for my android phone. I have a simple button input that is selected and added a .click() event. However, the click event does not work. I am missing something here? please help
[11:47:32] <jeremy-> Any idea how i can use datatables formAddNewRow to add rows when some fields are mdataprop nulled. AS: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-editable/wiki/AddingNewRecords#Add_new_record_form (works fine, but if there are any fields with null, addnewrow expects a value)
[11:47:45] <jonez> andrew9184, is that not the right way to do it?
[11:48:31] <jeremy-> fulminator: how did you actually write the click event, inside document ready? what class/id selector did you use
[11:50:27] <fulminator> $("id-of-button").click(function() { ... });
[11:51:02] <andrew9184> sure, pastebin it
[11:52:01] <fulminator> but it doesnt really matters. because it's a html page, it is running fine on my mozilla browser on PC, only on the phone it doesnt works
[11:52:03] <jonez> andrew9184, ok
[11:53:20] <jonez> andrew9184, http://jquery.privatepaste.com/54aa66ee7e
[11:53:37] <jeremy-> fulminator: you need # before an id in order to select it, im not sure if that is a typo
[11:53:48] <fulminator> no, lol, it's not a type
[11:54:09] <jeremy-> you will also need to have loaded a version of jquery, and the click event has to be inside $(document).ready(function() {
[11:54:12] <fulminator> because on PC browser works fine
[11:54:19] <fulminator> because on PC browser works fine
[11:54:38] <jeremy-> maybe im wrong, but as i understand css, you select an ID with #, and class with . before the element name
[11:54:50] <jeremy-> might be different browsers handle css differently
[11:55:01] <fulminator> the android phone wont recocnize when I click that button
[11:55:06] <jeremy-> and your phone browser isnt interpretting that incorrect syntax the same way as your pc allowed to do it
[11:55:07] <BillCriswell> jeremy-: Nope. That's right.
[11:55:14] <fulminator> it is not the css.
[11:55:17] <jeremy-> okay, so jquery allows id without hash
[11:55:19] <fulminator> well.
[11:55:25] <BillCriswell> fulminator: #('#id-of-button') is what you want.
[11:56:03] <jeremy-> Bill just to clarify, did you mean to agree with me or explain that jquery allows an ID selector without #
[11:56:03] <BillCriswell> It doesn't allow it without the hash.
[11:56:15] <jeremy-> okay, i got confused :D
[11:56:27] <fulminator> you mean $('#id-of-button') ?
[11:56:32] <BillCriswell> It does not allow you to do just  $('foo'), it has to be $('#foo')
[11:56:36] <BillCriswell> fulminator: Yes.
[11:56:37] <jeremy-> fulminator. basically some browsers will allow you to make a mistake, because every browser interprets css differently
[11:56:43] <BillCriswell> $('foo') would select all foo elements.
[11:56:52] <fulminator> THIS IS NOT CSS, lol
[11:56:56] <fulminator> this is jquery
[11:57:02] <fulminator> no typo
[11:57:04] <jeremy-> jquery works by using css selectors
[11:57:06] <andrew9184> you should try to console.log instead of alert, especially objects returned from getJSON
[11:57:13] <andrew9184> jonez
[11:57:22] <jeremy-> Its quite rude to use caps when im helping you and you have no idea
[11:57:27] <jeremy-> not helping anymore :)
[11:57:28] <fulminator> how about if I use getElementById?
[11:57:38] <fulminator> lol, dude...
[11:57:46] <jonez> andrew9184, ok. I also changed the line that says location[city] back to just #city
[11:58:07] <jonez> andrew9184, am I supposed to use .value or .html or does it not matter?
[11:58:07] <BillCriswell> You should also put a race engine in your car and put it in neutral and push it up the hill.
[11:58:30] <andrew9184> and the val syntax
[11:58:35] <andrew9184> is $(foo).val(bar)
[11:58:40] <fulminator> ok, thank you guys!
[11:58:42] <andrew9184> not $(foo).val = bar
[11:58:45] <fulminator> ty jeremy
[11:58:46] <jonez> oh
[11:59:09] <ryanneufeld> fulminator: if you want to select something by ID using jquery you need the #
[11:59:27] <jonez> andrew9184, ty.. it's workin now
[11:59:34] <andrew9184> np

[12:17:48] <lanken> Kambfhase: it's 2 lines. not much to see
[12:18:31] <Kambfhase> you know, that request is async.
[12:18:44] <Kambfhase> that means you have to use a callback function
[12:19:12] <wachpwnski> what do you use to focus on an event?

[12:35:00] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/vr4gh/2/ might be a little easier to get?
[12:35:17] <jeremy-> If anybody has worked much with datatables. Using jeditable... http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-editable/wiki/AddingNewRecords is there any way to work with adding new rows other than with the form/button id method (eg, formAddNewRow/Button).... and using the jquery UI DIALOG (popup). Id prefer an inline add new row button as seen here: http://datatables.net/examples/api/add_row.html
[12:35:18] <jeremy-> .... So if i am using fnAddData... how can i define mdataprop that is null, etc.
[12:37:59] <wachpwnski> Yah BillCriswell, wrong focus thing. I meant scroll to.
[12:56:26] <rhizmoe> hi all. i have two different droppable classes next to each other and I'm having trouble getting one to trigger. is there a common reason for this? z-index perhaps?

[13:00:48] <garciawebdev> is it possible with jQuery to mantain a cloned element in sync with the original?
[13:01:07] <db42> what could be a reason for my $(document).ready not being hit all the time ?
[13:01:14] <db42> (like when going back in a page)
[13:03:11] <Kambfhase> garciawebdev: i srsly doubt thatis possible
[13:03:42] <garciawebdev> :/
[13:04:49] <garciawebdev> that would be awesom
[13:04:53] <garciawebdev> *awesome
[13:17:54] <rabx> Question about semantics... should I be using $(document).ready(function(){ or $(function() { ?
[13:18:16] <delinquentme> Is there a way I can test that I've included the bootstrap "bootstrap-tooltip" library in jquery?
[13:18:22] <delinquentme> I'm having issues with getting populs
[13:18:25] <delinquentme> popups**
[13:19:38] <juboba> I'm validating a form and the label appears with a width: 5em; I don't see this defined anywhere.... any ideas?.
[13:20:27] <jeremy-> When i upgraded jquery+jqueryui i noticed an error on the div selector with :not I decided I'd try out switching it for not() My selector isnt working. Can you see anything wrong with this: $("#secondary-tabs").not("#"+ primarytab + "-tabs").hide();
[13:20:47] <jeremy-> Is it because I'm evaluating not() with a variable?
[13:22:57] <jeremy-> If i log the "#" + primarytab + "-tabs" it resolves to the correct ID, and it was working previously with :not so i can only assume its something particular about not() that doesnt allow me to resolve a selector with a mix of variables and selectors
[13:23:19] <garciawebdev> do custom events fired like $(this).trigger('mycustomevent') propagate on DOM till document element?
[13:24:03] <garciawebdev> I think they don't unless "this" is a DOM element, right?
[13:26:08] <MistuhKurtz> garciawebdev, yes any event will bubble up through the DOM tree
[13:26:45] <garciawebdev> I've just tried and if the object that fires the event is not a DOM element, the event doesn't goes through DOM bubbling
[13:26:53] <MistuhKurtz> oh
[13:26:58] <MistuhKurtz> yeah
[13:27:05] <MistuhKurtz> does it even work at all?
[13:27:38] <kripster> could someone tell me how to count when a space is pressed in a textbox, http://jsfiddle.net/simevidas/8R9DH/
[13:27:40] <db42> what could be a reason for my $(document).ready not being hit all the time ?
[13:29:48] <MistuhKurtz> kripster, http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/8R9DH/99/
[13:30:09] <MistuhKurtz> ugh I wish jsfiddle wouldn't automatically save others' fiddles in my account
[13:31:42] <MistuhKurtz> db42, an error that halts js execution before it gets to your doc ready function?
[13:32:10] <kripster> mistuhkurtz, i only want it to count when I press a space, nothing else?
[13:32:19] <MistuhKurtz> i already did it that way.
[13:32:25] <db42> MistuhKurtz, i dont see any errors in the development console
[13:32:54] <MistuhKurtz> if you open up your console then you'll see the count only gets incremented when space is pressed, not when another key is pressed.

[13:36:20] <jrajav> Is there a way to tell if a $.each() short-circuited via return false; ?
[13:37:02] <jrajav> I'm trying to find a way to make nested $.each()'s all short-circuit (this function is finding a single element in a series of nested arrays
[13:37:22] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/gjcUP/5/ why isn't this function working properly? It should be checking if the value = -1, but it's not.
[13:37:23] <hlve> ;/
[13:37:34] <kripster> yeah got it mituhkurtz, so say i type "hello people of the world", my count will be 4, so how can i implement it that if i delete 2 of the spaces the count is reduced by 2??
[13:38:15] <Pilate> kripster: theres no comparison going on there... youre setting it to -1 with .value

[13:39:02] <Brodingo> with console.log()
[13:39:08] <saml> how can I simulate clicking an anchor?
[13:39:18] <Pilate> .click()
[13:39:18] <saml> jQuery('#anchorid').click() doesn't do
[13:39:29] <Brodingo> saml only bound js events can be triggered
[13:39:31] <jrajav> Brodingo: I don't understand how that's relevant to my question
[13:39:32] <Brodingo> not a native click
[13:39:40] <Rovak> hlve: first you have to ask the function to return a value that you can compare, should you should not pass a parameter
[13:39:42] <saml> so i can't really simulate click
[13:40:00] <Rovak> hlve: second, compare that returned value with -1 like: (returned value) == '-1'
[13:40:05] <Brodingo> jrajav you want to know if a loop is exited early?
[13:40:25] <jrajav> $.each(   ...  $.each( ) )
[13:40:32] <jrajav> The inner one just ended with a return false;
[13:40:40] <jrajav> I now want to end the outer one immediately too
[13:40:44] <jrajav> How do I do that
[13:41:03] <db42> if i have a <script src="blah.js"></script> and then i have a <script>useSomeFuncFromBlah.JS</script> will that function always be defined ?
[13:41:13] <db42> when the second <script> enters ?
[13:42:03] <Brodingo> set a variable in the inner loop and test it?
[13:43:42] <db42> any ideas ? should be a simple JS question..
[13:44:24] <Rovak> it should if you give us some more details like, which function, in which file is it defined, do you want to access it in the first or second script?
[13:44:25] <BillCriswell> db42: Yes. Your example is just weird.
[13:44:46] <db42> BillCriswell, how so ?
[13:45:12] <BillCriswell> If useSomeFuncBlah() is defined in blah.js you can use it in any script after it.
[13:45:44] <db42> k, there seems to be an issue where my Javascript isn't working the first time i browse to the page, but when i refresh it, it works fine
[13:45:51] <db42> any ideas on what can be the cause ?
[13:46:42] <Rovak> i had that problem once with Ext-JS, for me it only happened in chrome
[13:47:03] <Rovak> somehow it saved state between page refreshes
[13:48:02] <db42> how can i fix this ? i am using jquery mobile and it happens on chrome and mobilesafari atleast..
[13:48:14] <kripster> i get how to increment a count when i press the space but is there a way to decrease the count when i delete a space, basically i need a count of spaces on the page http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/8R9DH/102/, thx
[13:51:26] <db42> :(
[13:53:51] <Rovak> kripster: http://jsfiddle.net/8ED9n/1/
[13:55:27] <kripster> legend, thx rovak
[13:56:35] <db42> Rovak, how did oyu fix oyur issue ?
[13:57:57] <Rovak> mine was more of a layout problem with css that only happened after a refresh, i had a div somewhere that should be hidden but wasn't
[13:59:16] <db42> hmm.. blah
[14:03:21] <Rovak> i could use a code review on a small plugin that i'm working on https://github.com/Rovak/InlineAttachment
[14:04:12] <wroathe> Your mother is an http request.
[14:04:19] <wroathe> Whoops, wrong channel.
[14:04:44] <Rovak> if your mother is a http request then she frequently gets ddos attacks?
[14:04:54] <delinquentme> what method should be used for HTML objects created after the DOM is loaded?  I thought .live is what I wanted ... and thats been replaced with .on() ... however .on() isn't attaching the click event handler
[14:05:05] <delinquentme> ... to objects created after the DOM loads
[14:05:08] <rafaqueque> hello
[14:05:53] <rafaqueque> any chance to to implement a switch case with a selector on .on() ?
[14:05:57] <rafaqueque> is that possible
[14:05:59] <kripster> rovak, thx for your help, is there a way to disable typing when a user has entered more than 2 spaces http://jsfiddle.net/8ED9n/14/ so the only option they have is to delete?
[14:06:05] <wroathe> delinquentme: During the creation of the element just bind the handler... or use delegated handlers.
[14:06:22] <rafaqueque> i don't see a need to have multiple $(document).on('click','selector',etc);
[14:06:36] <rafaqueque> i want to switch case that "selector" argument
[14:06:38] <wroathe> rafaqueque: switch(e.type) case 'mouseover': // doStuff; break;
[14:06:42] <Rovak> kripster: in the entire text area or only after the last word?
[14:07:09] <wroathe> delinquentme: What element are you adding and to what parent?
[14:07:11] <rafaqueque> wroathe, would that be like $(document).on('click', funciton(event){ event.type ....? });
[14:07:23] <rafaqueque> i mean, i want to play with the selector, not the event
[14:07:33] <rafaqueque> something like event.selector
[14:07:45] <wroathe> rafaqueque: e.target
[14:07:47] <delinquentme> wroathe, im adding and removing divs
[14:07:49] <wroathe> or e.currentTarget
[14:07:54] <rafaqueque> wroathe, ok, thank you :)
[14:08:28] <wroathe> So you could say something like $('.parent-div').on('click', '.child-div', function(e) { // doStuff });
[14:08:48] <wroathe> Where .child-div is the selector for the elements that are being added and removed
[14:09:03] <kripster> after the last word, so in other words if they ignore the alert and try to keep typing it won't let them, it will only let them delete
[14:09:54] <wroathe> delinquentme: Make sense?
[14:09:57] <danfromuk> How do I check if an object exists in jquery? I've got this in a global JS file $('#tabBusinessPhoneSystems') but some pages don't have the tabBusinessPhoneSystems object.
[14:10:08] <Rovak> i think that is a bit tricky to implement, you could replace all the double spaces after a blur event from the textarea
[14:10:18] <Rovak> because what if someone adds spaces between words?
[14:10:46] <wroathe> danfromuk: $('selector').length === 0
[14:10:57] <delinquentme> wroathe, yeah I got one working :D thanks .. but the jquery docs make it seem like .on() had replaced delegate, live and .bind ?
[14:11:05] <Rovak> kripster: i think you are looking for something that filters excessive whitespace?
[14:11:22] <danfromuk> wroathe: is length = 0 does that mean it exists?
[14:11:26] <wroathe> delinquentme: On uses delegated events if you provide that second argument.
[14:11:34] <delinquentme> in addition ... its not very dry ... however I could always load the doc and just trigger a click event on the button thats creating the new dive
[14:11:36] <wroathe> danfromuk: Think about it
[14:12:15] <kripster> yeah that is tricky, what if we only increment the count when a space is entered after a character? so it would not count double spaces?
[14:12:40] <danfromuk> wroathe: got it
[14:12:42] <wroathe> delinquentme: That code I posted basically says, "Only run this handler if the event is bubbling from a child div"
[14:12:46] <Rovak> kripster: what exactly are you trying to do with those numbers or limit on spaces?
[14:13:06] <delinquentme> wroathe, which element? I saw three but something like this: $.on(".remove_biome_site","click", function(){
[14:13:15] <delinquentme> doesn't add that function to anything post DOM load
[14:13:19] <wroathe> $('.parent-div').on('click', '.child-div', function(e) { // doStuff });
[14:13:46] <wroathe> If you're looking to use delegated handlers that's the code you're looking for.
[14:14:09] <kripster> so this is for a person to enter there name, i only want them to enter first and last name, no middle names, so i guess if i count the spaces and the count is greater than 2 then i know they are entering two many names
[14:14:36] <wroathe> delinquentme: If you post code I'll show y ou what I mean
[14:14:46] <wroathe> https://gist.github.com/
[14:15:08] <SkiOne> kripster: some people have a space in their first name, someone I work with is named Jo Ann and she has a middle name too
[14:15:30] <SkiOne> just fyi
[14:15:56] <Rovak> kripster: "Firstname Secondname".replace(/\s{2,}/g, ' ').split(' ').length <= 2
[14:16:56] <kripster> sorry rovak as I'm sure you can guess i'm a bit of a newbie, can you explain what that does, apologies for my ignorance
[14:17:33] <Rovak> kripster: np, replace(/\s{2,}/g, ' ') replaces all the double spaces by a single space, so every word will only separated by a single space
[14:17:53] <Rovak> second, split the string on ' ' and you get an array words, check this array if its smaller or equal to 2 elements
[14:18:07] <Rovak> and that should do the trick
[14:18:40] <Cypher> Hi All. Having a hard time building jquery locally due to "TypeError: Cannot call method 'spawn' of undefined" when trying to run grunt? Any ideas? I've initialized/updated the submodules, installed all node packages, etc
[14:19:07] <wroathe> Cypher: Which version of grunt are you using?
[14:19:17] <wongon> I have an checkbox element identified by id foo.  When I check another checkbox with id 'bar', I want the foo checkbox to get unchecked.  $('#bar').click(function() { if (this.checked) { $('#foo').attr('checked', '')} })  is not working, but I don't know why it is not.
[14:19:21] <Cypher> grunt@0.4.0rc3
[14:19:59] <Cypher> maybe because the package.json specifies ~0.3.17 this is pulling the RC on accident?
[14:20:14] <kripster> hmm i get the logic rovak, so how do i implement that in my simple example
[14:20:57] <Cypher> wroathe: Is there an earlier version you recommend?
[14:21:01] <delinquentme> wroathe, I think I've got it working =] thanks!
[14:21:08] <wroathe> delinquentme: np
[14:21:22] <wroathe> Cypher: Did you build grunt from source or something?
[14:21:30] <Cypher> No, just did "npm install"
[14:21:37] <wroathe> npm for me installs grunt v0.3.17
[14:21:54] <Rovak> kripster: not gonna program the entire solution for you, i think i gave you enough hints ;)
[14:21:56] <wroathe> I'd try it with grunt v0.3.17
[14:22:12] <Cypher> wroathe: I have done some development on grunt, so maybe I have dev repos that are being searched?
[14:22:23] <Cypher> Will try now with 0.3.17, thanks
[14:22:33] <wroathe> Cypher: Potentially. I'm going to try to build it  now and see what happens.
[14:22:33] <kripster> yeah i understand, don't want you to program it all, thx for the pointers, lemme try
[14:22:47] <Cypher> wroathe: Thanks!
[14:24:04] <wroathe> Cypher: I get the same thing you got with 0.3.17
[14:24:33] <Cypher> wroathe: Sorry, I misread npm list. I have 0.3.17 installed, but grunt-git-authors and grunt-update-submodules pull in 0.4.0rc3
[14:25:36] <Cypher> wroathe: Thanks for your help. I have a small enhancement I want to submit for Deferred, and before doing so want to run the tests, and add one test
[14:26:28] <wroathe> Cypher: Did you get it corrected then?
[14:26:41] <Cypher> wroathe: No, not yet. Still seeing the same error. Will keep debugging
[14:27:35] <wroathe> Well, stick around. I'm seeing if I can get it going too.
[14:27:50] <Cypher> Sure, I appreciate the help
[14:28:33] <Cypher> Think I've got it
[14:29:09] <Cypher> try with grunt-update-submodules@0.1.2
[14:29:14] <EHLOVader> anyone know where to get the http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/query-object plugin
[14:29:17] <wroathe> Yeah
[14:29:27] <wroathe> Cypher: https://github.com/jaubourg/grunt-update-submodules/commit/5aef4324b3b96e3eaf6d70b96b6792f1ce981842
[14:29:29] <EHLOVader> or a better solution for query string manipulation, without writing one up myself
[14:29:37] <wroathe> They updated to 0.4 two days ago
[14:29:53] <Cypher> Hehe good time for me to jump on board huh?
[14:30:53] <danfromuk> wroathe: $('#tabBusinessPhoneSystems').length  gives Unable to get value of the property 'length': object is null or undefined
[14:32:55] <zfle> Can anyone tell me why this site goo.gl/SWgMY breaks when you click on Free Case Evaluation (the footer tucks under the page) once it hits the bottom (using jQuery anchor)
[14:32:58] <wroathe> danfromuk: Are you using jQuery?
[14:33:23] <danfromuk> Yes, and its loaded before the js code above.
[14:33:32] <wroathe> danfromuk: I mean are you SURE your using jQuery?
[14:33:33] <danfromuk> v 1.7.1
[14:33:35] <wroathe> danfromuk: Ok
[14:33:58] <wroathe> danfromuk: Can you post a code snippet?
[14:34:11] <kripster> sorry rovak, am confused, here is what i have tried http://jsfiddle.net/8ED9n/24/
[14:34:12] <wroathe> danfromuk: https://gist.github.com/
[14:34:15] <danfromuk> Sure. 1min
[14:34:48] <Rovak> well the alert works
[14:35:07] <kripster> got it, i just increased the count to >=3
[14:35:09] <kripster> cheers
[14:35:30] <danfromuk> wroathe: https://gist.github.com/ffbee1facf143261b1f3
[14:35:44] <Cypher> wroathe: What is the simplest way to get a php server running for the tests? I have nginx running on my machine but don't want to pollute my env
[14:36:05] <Rovak> php 5.4 buildin webserver?
[14:36:07] <wroathe> Cypher: MAMP
[14:36:14] <wroathe> Cypher: Or LAMP
[14:36:18] <wroathe> Cypher: Or WAMP
[14:36:53] <Cypher> LAMP is heavy weight for a disposable install though. Php built in webserver, hmmm. will look into it!
[14:37:23] <wroathe> Cypher: You asked for simple, not lightweight :)
[14:37:31] <Cypher> Ok fine, simple and lightweight :)
[14:37:42] <wroathe> danfromuk: Are you sure $ is defined as jQuery
[14:37:49] <Cypher> i want like "./grunt serve"
[14:38:02] <wroathe> It doesn't get much more simple than sudo apt-get install lamp
[14:38:09] <Cypher> I know something like that is coming soon, all node based
[14:38:29] <Cypher> Oh! I was reading as install "Apache, MySql, Php"
[14:38:31] <Cypher> let me try
[14:38:37] <danfromuk> wroathe: ah. I understand the problem now. $ is changed at the bottom of the index file.
[14:39:12] <wroathe> danfromuk: Yeah... If jQuery failes to find a matching element it should just return an empty jQuery object
[14:39:29] <wroathe> Cypher: It might be lamp-server
[14:39:37] <wroathe> Cypher: instead of lamp
[14:39:48] <kripster> any advice how to disable typing when someone tried to enter a 3rd name, ie they ignore the alert and try to keep typing http://jsfiddle.net/8ED9n/26/
[14:40:41] <wroathe> kripster: You could set a max length on the field equal to the number of characters that there currently are... but I'm not sure what you're trying to do.
[14:40:49] <wroathe> kripster: And I don't think I would do that ever anyways.
[14:41:09] <Cypher> hmm couldn't find either package on ubuntu.
[14:41:13] <martisj> morning all
[14:41:26] <Cypher> found only lampython - MPI-enhanced Python interpreter (LAM based version)  in apt-cache
[14:41:44] <kripster> the only issue is that if a person keeps on typing after the alert, if they try to delete the characters the alerts keep coming
[14:41:46] <wroathe> sudo apt-get update
[14:41:51] <wroathe> or upgrade or w/e
[14:43:00] <Cypher> heh, my favorite command is "apt-add-repository --remove ..."
[14:45:50] <kripster> hmmm, i'll work on that one, last question, can you guys recommend some sites for me to increase my knowledge of jquery thx
[14:46:08] <EHLOVader> I know it is quick to ask again, but anyone know where to get blair's query object jquery plugin while the plugin sites are under construction?
[14:46:12] <Cypher> http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[14:47:24] <kripster> cheers, cypher, anyone else?
[14:47:36] <danfromuk> Is anyone familiar with jixedbar? Is there anything similar which is still being actively developed?
[14:49:13] <wroathe> kripster: Honestly I'd start experimenting with the jQuery source if I were you
[14:49:33] <wroathe> kripster: Open Chrome Dev Tools, set break points and start messing around in console.
[14:50:12] <wroathe> Cypher: It looks like they removed that shortcut
[14:50:26] <kripster> ok cheers, but any good tutorials about, youtube, lynda etc... can't keep coming here when i get stuck and annoying you guys
[14:50:51] <Cypher> wroathe: np, I'll try the built in php server
[14:53:16] <wroathe> Cypher: http://askubuntu.com/questions/34/whats-the-easiest-way-to-set-up-a-lamp-stack
[14:54:11] <Cypher> Got php built in server going, works nicely. Thanks Rovak and wroathe
[14:54:19] <wroathe> Cypher: Nice.
[14:54:27] <Cypher> http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php
[14:54:51] <wroathe> Cypher: Cool. Didn't know it included a server now too.
[14:55:08] <wroathe> Cypher: Jesus, LAMP takes forever to install on Ubuntu.
[14:55:13] <wroathe> I'm doing that right now on a VM
[14:55:39] <wroathe> Why do you need PHP for contributing to jQuery?
[14:57:21] <wroathe> Cypher: How did you go about installing the older version of grunt-update-submodules?
[14:57:58] <wroathe> Cypher: I just cloned the repo and checked out the previous commit and then ran 'npm install' and moved the repo into jQueries local node_modules
[15:04:20] <sontek> Is there a good way to place a div at the bottom of viewport instead of bottom of the scrolled window?
[15:04:25] <sontek> I want to popup a 'saving...' dialog
[15:04:32] <sontek> but want it viewable if they are scrolled to the top
[15:05:29] <sontek> I've tried using css with position absolute, bottom: 10px but its at the bottom of the scroll instead of viewport
[15:06:47] <sontek> seems to work if I move it outside of the relative container though
[15:08:56] <eip56> whats up n3rds
[15:12:31] <delinquentme> is there a jquery command to shrink a div to remove any unaccounted for white space?
[15:13:09] <delinquentme> not like .trim() though
[15:13:28] <eip56> unaccoutned for white space?
[15:13:37] <eip56> is there any rules attached to it in css?
[15:13:45] <eip56> are*
[15:13:49] <lanken> I have an event which fires when a user clicks on a button. The buttons have class "clickable", and each button has a unique ID
[15:13:51] <delinquentme> I mean if a div is set to height:100px ... and theres an element within it that has a height of 20px ... collapse the 100px div down to the required space for the 20px div
[15:14:06] <lanken> I want the event to pass the id of the button clicked to the function which fires
[15:14:34] <JesperA> delinquentme why do that with jQuery, isnt the CSS properties enough?
[15:14:37] <zfle> Can anyone tell me why this site goo.gl/SWgMY breaks when you click on Free Case Evaluation (the footer tucks under the page) once it hits the bottom (using jQuery anchor)
[15:14:38] <tw2113> delinquentme, wouldn't setting the height to auto be enough?
[15:14:46] <lanken> so it should be something like $("button[class=clickable]").click( function ( *buttonID* ) { blah blah } );
[15:15:35] <lanken> would *buttonID* be $(this).id ? or some such?
[15:16:06] <shoky> lanken: this.id
[15:16:21] <shoky> lanken: either that or $(this).prop('id')
[15:16:37] <delinquentme> tw2113, +1
[15:16:40] <zfle> ^^ I mean to say in IE9
[15:16:43] <lanken> shoky: so, I put that inside the () which hold the argument of the function
[15:16:54] <zfle> meant
[15:17:00] <shoky> lanken: no, that's where the event goes
[15:17:14] <lanken> shoky: are those parentheses always empty?
[15:17:47] <shoky> lanken: many times you put 'event' there because the event object is passed as first argument. but you can leave it empty if you dont need anything from the event object
[15:18:10] <lanken> ok
[15:18:18] <Bubo> I have: <td id="45">329.20</td> ---> var numberString = $("#45").text(); --> gives me undefined.. any idea why?
[15:18:48] <shoky> ?demo @ Bubo
[15:18:49] <bot-t> Bubo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:19:49] <lanken> shoky: currently working with 	alert($(this).prop('id'));
[15:20:05] <lanken> thanks!
[15:20:08] <shoky> lanken: this.id  is just as good, and is also shorter
[15:20:22] <cambazz> how can i iterate over each input in a form? i.e: I am doing $('#posForm input').each(function(), but this wont include the select and textareas
[15:20:49] <shoky> ?:input @ cambazz
[15:20:51] <bot-t> cambazz, :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[15:20:53] <lanken> shoky: I see I see.
[15:21:09] <lanken> shoky: thought that was like, partially pseudocode. But it's a specific syntactic sugar...
[15:21:41] <shoky> lanken: what's sugar?
[15:22:25] <lanken> shoky: there's a good article on it in wikipedia. It's just a term for features of a language that make things easier but don't add power
[15:22:35] <lanken> shoky: so like i++ in C
[15:22:41] <shoky> heh that's not what i meant
[15:22:46] <shoky> i know what sugar is ;p
[15:22:52] <lanken> shoky: is syntactic sugar for i = i+1
[15:23:14] <lanken> shoky: oh, then it seems like this.id is sugar
[15:23:25] <shoky> lanken:  it's not
[15:23:51] <shoky> lanken: that's the native javascript way to access a DOM node's properties
[15:23:56] <lanken> shoky: oh, it's not equivalent to $(this).prop('id') ?
[15:24:13] <shoky> lanken: one could argue that .prop() is the sugary one
[15:24:22] <shoky> but definitely not the other way round
[15:24:34] <Cypher> wroathe: Sorry, I was away
[15:24:40] <Cypher> You need php to run the ajax tests
[15:24:51] <Cypher> wroathe: Sorry, I was away
[15:24:52] <shoky> lanken: 'this' in event handlers is just a good ol' native DOM element
[15:25:07] <lanken> aha
[15:25:17] <wroathe> Cypher: Ahh, I forgot about that.
[15:25:19] <Cypher> did you get the grunt working? I removed the old package and reinstallled the specific version
[15:25:38] <wroathe> What's the syntax for installing a specific version? I did mine a more manual way.
[15:26:20] <wroathe> I actually cloned the repo down, checked out the commit before the recent one, and npm installed it to my jQuery node_modules directory
[15:26:39] <Cypher> npm install package@version
[15:26:54] <wroathe> Ahh
[15:27:05] <UltraMC> $('.likeIt').click(function(e) {        //how to unhook click from this here?
[15:27:06] <wroathe> For some reason I thought it was npm install package version
[15:27:20] <Cypher> i tried that too, actually "npm install package -v version"
[15:27:23] <Bubo> how do I make: if there isn't an id that I am geting with $("id") - it shouldn't crash the script and pass on the next
[15:27:24] <Cypher> ruby gemism
[15:27:30] <Bubo> it's in a loop
[15:27:35] <lanken> shoky: can I define arbitrary properties for my elements?
[15:27:47] <wroathe> UltraMC: $('.likeIt').one('click', function(e) {});
[15:27:49] <Cypher> Bubo - It's $("#id") btw
[15:28:00] <lanken> shoky: I'm looking at having something like this: <td x=3 y=-2>Ahoy</td>
[15:28:08] <Bubo> yes, typo
[15:28:10] <UltraMC> wroathe, but I have more than one .likeIt
[15:28:11] <lanken> shoky: I'll try it and see.
[15:28:32] <shoky> lanken: yes, but it's better to use data-* attributes on the HTML, and use jquery's .data() to read them and to write per-element data
[15:28:34] <wroathe> UltraMC: That will bind a handler to each .likeIt that will only fire one time and then unbind itself.
[15:28:34] <shoky> ?data @ lanken
[15:28:35] <bot-t> lanken, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:28:47] <UltraMC> wroathe, kk seen docs. Cool kthnxbye
[15:28:51] <wroathe> ?one @ UltraMC
[15:28:51] <bot-t> UltraMC, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[15:28:53] <Cypher> so Bubo, just check $("#id").length > 0
[15:29:00] <Bubo> oh thaks
[15:29:02] <Cypher> before you dig into the objects
[15:29:04] <lanken> shoky: because browsers would interfere with my made-up attributes, right?
[15:29:26] <Cypher> Bubo: If in a loop, probably you want to break if $("#id").length == 0
[15:29:28] <wroathe> lanken: Because arbitrary attributes are invalid HTML
[15:29:33] <Cypher> err === if js
[15:29:36] <shoky> lanken: mostly old browsers i think. but .data() could be more performant too
[15:29:48] <wroathe> lanken: And because that's what .data is for
[15:29:56] <shoky> lanken: because jquery has its own per-element data cache
[15:29:59] <lanken> wroathe: web standards are so prescriptive =P
[15:30:02] <Cypher> lanken & shocky, consider either $.data or html5 "data" attributes
[15:30:16] <Cypher> lanken, in html5 any attribute starting with "data-" is valid
[15:30:18] <shoky> Cypher: that's exactly what i just told him ;p
[15:30:18] <wroathe> shoky: exactly
[15:30:29] <Cypher> for example, data-username='cypher'
[15:30:29] <lanken> shoky: and so it's going to be faster than shuffling through the DOM or whatever
[15:30:39] <Cypher> shoky: Oh sorry, missed it
[15:31:07] <lanken> Cypher: oh, nice. I like the idea of having it in the HTML at this stage.
[15:31:10] <wroathe> lanken: When you use jQueries .data method it adds a property to that element with an cache ID for that element
[15:31:23] <wroathe> lanken: It would be better to use .data instead of data-* attributes
[15:31:37] <wroathe> For both performance reasons and for good style reasons
[15:31:42] <shoky> wroathe: the data-* attributes are for the HTML markup
[15:31:56] <lanken> Cypher: so I would write <td data-x="0" data-y="-3">Ahoy!</td>
[15:32:04] <shoky> wroathe: perfectly fine to use them. of course, they should only be read from, not written to
[15:32:14] <Cypher> lanken: Yes, that would be valid
[15:32:16] <lanken> wroathe: better how? faster?
[15:32:23] <UltraMC> http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/demoty/
[15:32:28] <UltraMC> not here sorry!
[15:33:00] <Bubo> I have this: http://dpaste.com/847515/ --> It doesn't change the values of the elements..
[15:33:02] <Bubo> any idea why?
[15:35:10] <Cypher> Bubo - Use console.log to debug
[15:35:23] <Bubo> how
[15:35:46] <wroathe> lanken: In edge cases storing complicated structures in data attributes causes memory leaks in IE
[15:35:51] <wroathe> lanken: But in your situation it's probably fine.
[15:36:14] <wroathe> lanken: I'm not speaking from experience on that.
[15:36:20] <lanken> wroathe: wonderful. That's what I needed to know :)
[15:36:42] <Bubo> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[15:37:46] <UltraMC> how to $(this).text(this text + string);
[15:38:23] <shoky> UltraMC: $(this).text(function(i,text){ return text + string });
[15:39:00] <coldhead> shoky++
[15:39:01] <UltraMC> shoelessone, why `i` there ?
[15:39:18] <shoky> UltraMC because the API docs say it's there
[15:39:32] <coldhead> it's a counter, unused in this example but you still need to give it a name
[15:39:33] <shoky> UltraMC: it's the index, for cases where $(...) is a collection of objects
[15:39:34] <UltraMC> How to parse string to int if I can ask here
[15:39:49] <shoky> parseInt(str,10)
[15:43:45] <eip56> im having a brain fart and this code is working very well. Whats the best way to absolute center say a lightbox?
[15:48:47] <dblosevn> eip56: jquery.center is what i use for that type of stuff
[15:49:59] <eip56> that a plugin or native?
[15:50:17] <dblosevn> plugin this looks like a variation of what i have used in the past http://andreaslagerkvist.com/jquery/center/#jquery-plugin-example-code
[15:51:04] <eip56> thanks man that will work
[15:51:48] <dblosevn> :-)
[15:55:36] <cambazz> hello, i have a radio button group with name vftradio. how can i check at least one is selected? I have done: $('input[name="vftradio"]:checked').attr('rel') then i look if typeof is undefined
[15:55:44] <cambazz> but i dont think this is a good way
[15:55:55] <Cypher> Hey all, just submitted a simple enhancement to Deferred objects which allows direct chaining of two deferred objects. See https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1088 and please +1 if you would like this feature
[16:04:35] <lanken> I'm giving up on notepad++
[16:04:45] <lanken> it doesn't work with my touchpad (no scrolling)
[16:04:59] <lanken> anyone have a favorite alternative windows text editor?
[16:05:09] <tw2113> sublime text
[16:05:16] <Cypher> vi :)
[16:05:35] <coldhead> sublime text has the disadvantage of not being free in any sense
[16:06:07] <lanken> coldhead: ouch
[16:06:13] <tw2113> coldhead, lanken never specified price
[16:06:20] <tw2113> and it is well worth the key cost
[16:06:23] <tw2113> :)
[16:06:40] <Cypher> lanken: An investment in learning vi will pay itself off many fold. However, I will not discount the investment that is required. It's sizable
[16:06:41] <coldhead> i don't even mind the price so much as not having access to the source
[16:07:13] <lanken> Cypher: I have an additional issue with vi -- I'm a dvorak typist
[16:07:35] <lanken> Cypher: so the hotkeys aren't going to be in the right places. It's much worse with emacs, but I think it's a problem for vi.
[16:08:40] <coldhead> i had never considered the plight of dvorak typists and text editors
[16:08:44] <coldhead> they must all suck
[16:08:53] <Cypher> lanken: You can easily remap them to whatever you like
[16:09:26] <Cypher> someone made a cheat sheet for dvorak too - http://boredzo.org/vi_tutorial/vi_tutorial-Dvorak-Color.pdf
[16:09:36] <lanken> thanks!
[16:09:50] <lanken> I don't like the idea of investing time learning Sublime, although it does look very nice.
[16:10:27] <lanken> even if I bite the bullet and pay $60 for a license, then I have to manage my relationship with them...keep track of credentials..yuck.
[16:11:02] <lanken> Cypher: is there a vi program that does tabbed interface, multiple document search, etc?
[16:11:14] <coldhead> that's the virtue of properly free cross platform editors: you can just get on with it
[16:11:15] <tw2113> 1 key, as many machines as you want, just leave the key in your inbox
[16:11:55] <coldhead> lanken: this is the most pimped vim config i know of https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles/tree/master/.vim
[16:11:55] <tw2113> but i'm biased in favor
[16:15:11] <Cypher> lanken: Yes, lots is enabled through addons. Vim has tabs built in
[16:15:26] <lanken> Cypher: cool
[16:16:10] <Cypher> lanken: Check out http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/
[16:16:39] <Cypher> in particular look at NERDTree
[16:18:23] <Whirl3d> How can you tell if you have been muted or something? I can't seem to get anyone to respond in #css--but then again I have a bad attitude towards #css (sorry to be off-topic)
[16:19:10] <ronson> I have some grid plugin that I have wrapped inside a form.  When i press enter inside a cell, it submits the form.  How do I prevent the form from being submit?  e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation doesnt work
[16:19:15] <Cypher> #css has no style
[16:19:23] <coldhead> Whirl3d: ask in #freenode
[16:19:29] <coldhead> it's their kind of problem
[16:19:35] <ronson> is it possible to do something like $(this).closest('form').preventSubmit() or something
[16:19:51] <Whirl3d> coldhead, will do, thanks.
[16:20:01] <Cypher> ronson: Try $("#my-form").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[16:20:18] <coldhead> $(this).closest('form').prop('disabled', true) might work
[16:20:28] <ronson> Cypher, I don't always want to prevent it though
[16:20:33] <ronson> only from within a cell
[16:20:40] <ronson> ill try disabled
[16:20:49] <ronson> but then when do i reenable it
[16:21:19] <coldhead> in every other cell?
[16:21:38] <coldhead> it sounds like you want something else, like maybe a submit handler that checks what was actually clicked
[16:21:46] <Cypher> ronson: Ah I see. So perhaps you can bind to keypress in the cell and stop propagation if it's enter? Kind of nasty
[16:22:01] <ronson> Cypher: I did but it didnt prevent the form submission
[16:22:06] <ronson> coldhead: that might be it.
[16:22:32] <ronson> the grid is too deep that the (e) doesnt reference the form any longer somehow
[16:23:18] <ronson> submit handler wont work actually
[16:23:26] <ronson> i have multiple of those form/grid combos per page
[16:23:31] <ronson> that will duplicate the calls
[16:24:10] <Cypher> ronson: Did you try e.stopImmediatePropagation ?
[16:25:14] <ronson> Cypher: that worked
[16:25:15] <ronson> thanks
[16:25:23] <ronson> what does that do
[16:26:08] <Cypher> immediate stops other non-parent handlers
[16:26:09] <Cypher> See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5299740/jquery-stoppropagation-vs-stopimmediatepropagation
[16:27:00] <ronson> Good to know, thanks again :)
[16:27:51] <ronson> Ohhh now I know why it didnt consider it a parent, because im doing $(document).on(keydown etc - foolish me
[16:28:08] <Cypher> Sure, no problem
[16:32:47] <jwg2s> Hey all, I'm tried to select a <tr> element and it's <td> children, but none of the <td>'s children.  I've spent almost 2 hours now trying to figure this out, is this possible?
[16:32:53] <jwg2s> trying*
[16:33:23] <snover> yes
[16:33:37] <jwg2s> I've tried .not() .children() .parent() etc
[16:33:48] <Cypher> jwg2s: you want to select a row, and then all of its children?
[16:34:08] <Cypher> what's wrong with something like
[16:34:16] <Cypher> var row = $("#my-row");
[16:34:26] <Cypher> var cells = row.children("td");
[16:34:27] <Cypher> ?
[16:36:32] <dblosevn> var cells = row.find('td')
[16:36:52] <jwg2s> http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4281/screenshot20121217at734.png
[16:37:04] <dblosevn> cells.each(function() { //dosomething } );
[16:37:05] <jwg2s> I'm makignt he row a link
[16:37:18] <jwg2s> But if they click Add Contacts, I don't want that link to be activated
[16:37:44] <jwg2s> And since that button is a child of tr[data-link], it's overriding the button's behavior
[16:38:11] <dblosevn> jwg2s: stop propagation on the button
[16:38:33] <dblosevn> and bind the buttons after the row click
[16:38:39] <jwg2s> dblosevn: can you be a little more specific?  I'm more of a controller/model layer rails developer and just getting into coffescript/jquery
[16:38:58] <dblosevn> let me see some code
[16:39:29] <jwg2s> sure one sec
[16:39:35] <dblosevn> youll want to bind your row click handler before the handler for the add contacts button
[16:40:03] <dblosevn> then stop propagtion in your button click handler to keep the event from bubbling to the row
[16:40:28] <jwg2s> https://gist.github.com/1e400c67f5fa0cb775db
[16:43:18] <dblosevn> jwg2s: try this $("tr[data-link]").click ->    if (!$(this).is('.btn'))	window.location = this.dataset.link
[16:43:58] <jwg2s> Nope still catches it
[16:44:51] <dblosevn> put a breakpoint on window.loc.... and watch `this` tell me what element it is when you click the button
[16:46:29] <jwg2s> [object HTMLTableRowElement]
[16:46:40] <jwg2s> i just did an alert, do i need do a real breakpoint I'm guessing
[16:47:53] <shoky> not 'this'
[16:47:56] <shoky> event.target
[16:50:14] <shoky> or: $('tr[data-link]').on('click', ':not(a.btn)', function() { .... })
[16:51:11] <shoky> or handle click event on the a.btn and call event.stopPropagation()
[16:51:23] <jwg2s> I lose the dataset.link value when I do that
[16:51:25] <jwg2s> or how do I keep that?
[16:51:29] <shoky> when you do what
[16:51:56] <shoky> i gave 3 diff solutions ;p
[16:52:36] <jwg2s> Haha the last one
[16:52:41] <jwg2s> Thanks for your help
[16:54:07] <shoky> with the last one i meant:  $('tr[data-link] td a.btn').click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation() });  $('tr[data-link]').click(function() { window.location... });
[16:54:27] <shoky> two seperate handlers
[16:55:53] <shoky> with the first, i meant:  $('tr[data-link]').click(function() { if (!$(event.target).is('.btn')) window.location = this.dataset.link })
[16:55:58] <jwg2s> $("tr[data-link]").click (e) ->
[16:55:59] <jwg2s>     return if $(e.target).is('a.btn')
[16:55:59] <jwg2s>     window.location = this.dataset.link
[16:56:00] <jwg2s> got it
[16:56:08] <shoky> yah
[16:56:27] <jwg2s> pretty readable too! haha
[16:56:29] <jwg2s> is a.btn
[16:56:39] <shoky> ;]
[16:56:43] <jwg2s> Thanks again!
[16:56:58] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone!
[16:59:15] <DoctorMonocular> any idea why a callback would execute before its FadeIn animation completes?
[16:59:32] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @DoctorMonocular
[16:59:33] <DoctorMonocular> I've tried normal callbacks, and now promise().done( but the results are identical
[16:59:33] <bot-t> DoctorMonocular, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:00:07] <DoctorMonocular> sure, I have something, one sec
[17:01:02] <DoctorMonocular> http://art.petermichaud.com/
[17:01:22] <DoctorMonocular> so, click the portrait at the bottom to go a different picture
[17:02:37] <DoctorMonocular> what's supposed to happen is that the current picture fades to .75 for 200ms, then a new div fades in with the new picture for 500ms, then at that point the original picture is replaced with the new picture and the new fading div is removed. It should be a smooth transition from one pic to the next, but instead it jumps
[17:03:09] <DoctorMonocular> the div doesn't fade in all the way before the $art.src is changed
[17:03:19] <DoctorMonocular> causing the jump
[17:05:29] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: Post the actual code. I don't think anyone here wants to dig through the site's source files.
[17:05:50] <DoctorMonocular> ok, it's pretty brief code, one sec
[17:06:26] <DoctorMonocular> https://gist.github.com/c97491acc0f2e96e8b75
[17:06:31] <DoctorMonocular> the problem is in the load_art function
[17:07:16] <DoctorMonocular> and like I said, I switched it to the promise() pattern recently from just vanilla callbacks in an attempt to fix this issue
[17:07:21] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: Why use .promise().done() instead of just $().fadeIn(300, function () {});
[17:07:42] <DoctorMonocular> yeah see my comment right above, both have identical behavior
[17:08:05] <DoctorMonocular> I didit because I read on SO that it maight help with timing issues. It was a long shot, it didn't work
[17:08:56] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: One sec.
[17:09:46] <rideh> whats a good way to remember states of accordians and dismissed alert dialogs?
[17:10:06] <DoctorMonocular> https://gist.github.com/16a195ed562ac224615b -- there it is with just callbacks
[17:10:37] <DoctorMonocular> rideh can you be more specific? you want to get like control values from the dalogs or what?
[17:11:34] <rideh> DoctorMonocular: I have some generic alerts and my side navigation uses an accordion style display.  Everytime i navigate from one page to another the states of everything gets reset. menus collapse, alerts re-appear.
[17:11:45] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: http://jsfiddle.net/TNsKt/1/
[17:12:18] <rideh> DoctorMonocular: cookies the recommended way of handling this or what
[17:13:16] <DoctorMonocular> it depends on your philosophy, some people would say you should put that in the query string
[17:13:42] <DoctorMonocular> wroathe, what do you think is different about your code that's making it work where mine fails?
[17:14:18] <rideh> DoctorMonocular: guess thats why i'm asking for a recommendation. i dont care eithr way but I want it seemless for users and fast
[17:14:22] <wroathe> I've never used the promise done thing before.
[17:14:30] <wroathe> I'll look at it more closely.
[17:14:36] <DoctorMonocular> is this in a larger app rideh?
[17:14:56] <DoctorMonocular> most apps will generate things on the server side and pass them to the client side
[17:15:18] <DoctorMonocular> if you don't eally have a server side, then sure cookies could work, but they won't always work since people can disable them
[17:15:19] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: My first thought is that there's something funky going on with the fact that you're creating a <img> fragment in the outer scope and reusing it.
[17:15:50] <rideh> DoctorMonocular: they'd have more problems with cookies arent enabled with this site. its a small membership management app for local community
[17:16:18] <DoctorMonocular> wroathe, well I didn't want to bias your first look, but actually this code worked perfectly at one point, and somewhere along the way something changed and it started fucking up, and I couldn't figure out what it was, but maybe I need to go back to the beginning and build it piece by piece. Gr.
[17:16:32] <rideh> DoctorMonocular: suppose I could capture alert state and store that on the server though, didnt really think about that.
[17:16:42] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: Let me try something.
[17:16:46] <DoctorMonocular> cool
[17:17:05] <rideh> I think I'll leave the menu state client side -
[17:17:22] <DoctorMonocular> rideh, yeah I'd maybe consider passing the state of the nav via ajax back to the server, then having the server populate the right variables for the client code to do its thing
[17:18:12] <rideh> DoctorMonocular: I'll have to talk to my django dev about how that would work
[17:18:36] <DoctorMonocular> what would be phenomenal is if I could just switch the src of the main image and let css transitions do the cross fade work for me. But alas...
[17:19:43] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: I'm rewriting a lot of this. There are a few things that are making me uncomfortable.
[17:19:55] <DoctorMonocular> sure, have at it
[17:20:31] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: Actually for what you're trying to do I'd recommend that you just set up either Cycle or FlexSlider
[17:20:48] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: If you use cycle lite you'll wind up with a hell of a lot less code.
[17:21:06] <DoctorMonocular> will it really do everything I need it to do though?
[17:21:55] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: You'll set up a list with images inside of it and then when you initialize the slider you'll set a callback to generate a pager
[17:22:06] <wroathe> and inside of that navi bar at the bottom you'll have it create thumbnails.
[17:22:28] <DoctorMonocular> what about my caption box that appears on hover?
[17:22:55] <wroathe> $(thumb).on('hover', function () { // show caption });
[17:22:58] <wroathe> http://www.pennscale.com/products/bench-scales/defender-3000-bench-series/
[17:23:07] <wroathe> I did what I'm talking about here.
[17:23:20] <DoctorMonocular> yeah, looks like it could work
[17:23:31] <wroathe> Although I did it with flexslider
[17:23:36] <DoctorMonocular> I'd need to restructure a little, but the heavy lifting would be out of my hands at least
[17:23:36] <wroathe> In your case I'd recommend cycle lite
[17:23:56] <wroathe> Oh, wait, cycle lite doesn't support pagers
[17:24:41] <wroathe> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/pager2.html
[17:24:48] <wroathe> You'll have to use the full cycle plugin
[17:24:59] <ronson> IF I bind something to a form submit like $('form').on('submit', tonsOfCalcs);
[17:25:11] <ronson> Will the form submit ONLY after tonsOfCalcs is complete?
[17:26:09] <wroathe> ronson: Yeah
[17:27:43] <ronson> wroathe: ty
[17:28:16] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: You'll be able to get rid of most of that code in main.js by doing it that way.
[17:28:28] <DoctorMonocular> I'll give it a shot, thanks a lot
[17:30:33] <wroathe> Also the reason the callback is firing early is because the element you're trying to fade is already faded.
[17:32:06] <DoctorMonocular> $div?
[17:32:28] <wroathe> Yeah
[17:37:28] <DoctorMonocular> according to my inspector, right before $div.fadeIn
[17:37:34] <DoctorMonocular> display = none and opacity = 1
[17:38:04] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: For a demonstration of what I'm talking about go back to my demo and click on the button once, wait for the alert, and then click it again.
[17:39:04] <wroathe> While it may be an easy fix to just put a $div.hide().fadeIn there I'd still rewrite it using cycle.
[17:39:05] <DoctorMonocular> yeah I get it, but if you look at my code, the callback for $div.fadeIn has a call to $div.hide()
[17:39:07] <wroathe> It'll be easier to maintain.
[17:39:42] <DoctorMonocular> so it goes away after it's shown, and indeed when you click it (everytime you click it) the inspector shows that $div is hidden
[17:39:52] <DoctorMonocular> but you're right, using the plugin is going to be more maintainable
[17:40:16] <wroathe> I don't see a call to .hide
[17:43:00] <DoctorMonocular> actually in the gist it's $div.fadeOut(500)
[17:49:45] <graft> hey folks, anyone know something like tablekit for jquery?
[17:50:34] <graft> something that has table column sorting/resizing and looks reasonably nice
[17:53:37] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: I made you a demo because I'm bored.
[17:53:38] <wroathe> http://jsfiddle.net/TNsKt/10/
[17:54:51] <dblosevn> bordem rocks :-)
[17:54:55] <coldhead> that was nice of you wroathe!
[17:56:44] <wroathe> coldhead: Who doesn't like Octocats...
[17:58:36] <coldhead> people who hate cryptozoology, i guess
[18:43:34] <DoctorMonocular> thanks a lot wroath, you're the man (man")
[18:56:56] <veQue> wroathe you mean ou made us a demo?
[19:45:58] <RukaPHP> how can acces link with jquery
[19:49:10] <monk3y> $('a#linkId').function();
[19:49:48] <monk3y> So give the link (<a id="something"), 'select' it by using $('a#something'). .. then call functions on it.
[19:49:55] <monk3y> Depends on what you want to 'do' with it..
[19:50:55] <monk3y> NOTE: I may be inaccurate if not fatally incorrect.
[19:51:24] <monk3y> As long as your javascript isn't controlling any heavy machinery or life-support systems (?), go ahead and try it out.
[19:51:35] <R00tk3y> Hello
[19:51:54] <R00tk3y> Is it possible to send an image along with otherdata over a form using jquery
[19:52:04] <R00tk3y> Is there anything I have to do to get it ready for the sending?
[19:55:30] <GoSox> So I read that some people use #hash links in their URLs to make their dynamic websites more searchable to bots and whatnot. But I don't get how this would work? Even with a hashed link, it's still content that needs to be generated in javascript, not server side. So it's still not going to be there for bots to index, right?
[19:55:35] <GoSox> I feel like there's something i'm missing
[19:56:16] <R00tk3y> Is it possible to send files with jQuery or no?
[19:58:31] <monk3y> R00tk3y: yeah there's a jQuery plugin, which at last test only works 100% in some browsers - and you have to use an iFrame for others.
[19:58:51] <GoSox> it only works 100%?
[19:59:01] <GoSox> oh i see what you mean
[19:59:03] <R00tk3y> Only works in some browsers is what he is saying
[19:59:05] <GoSox> that sounded weird
[19:59:07] <monk3y> But it was a little bit of voodoo for my li'l brain.  'course I think that was down to the Backbone+CakePHP design I had inherited.
[19:59:13] <RukaPHP> [monk3y]: i wanna that when click a button id="a" call the link(this.href) of button id="b"
[19:59:59] <monk3y> GoSox: not sure mate, sounds like you'd be successful finding a stack of opinions from a Google-trawl.
[20:00:05] <RukaPHP> [monk3y]: open link of button id="b"
[20:00:27] <monk3y> RukaPHP: so you want to click an <a>, and invoke the link of a nearby <button>?
[20:01:42] <monk3y> Not sure what kind of UX trickery you're implementing, but yeah, shouldn't be hard.  $('a#something').click(function(){$('button#otherthing').click();});
[20:03:38] <monk3y> Or an approximate derivative/extension of that.
[20:06:55] <Whirl3d> Good evenin' all. Anybody know of a cool, extremely flexible, date selector script. More than just a popup calendar, I need to be abel to increment/decrement each part of a date individually...any ideas?
[20:07:09] <Whirl3d> *able
[20:07:50] <RukaPHP> [monk3y]: http://paste.lymas.com.br/2534
[20:08:26] <RukaPHP> [monk3y]: some problem, nothing happens
[20:09:53] <monk3y> So it stays on the original page and nothing at all happens?
[20:10:19] <monk3y> Because it looks like in the beforeSend, you should be going off to the #linkVisualizar's page..
[20:10:37] <monk3y> If, indeed, there is a 'load' function.
[20:10:43] <monk3y> Have you got the console open - no errors there?
[20:10:54] <RukaPHP> no errors
[20:11:10] <monk3y> Sorry, I'm no hardcore at this.  I'm just a guy that's having his honeymoon with jQuery, so I've fooled around with it a little.
[20:11:23] <monk3y> .. and I call it my wife a lot.  Is that wierd?
[20:11:42] <veQue> nooooo
[20:11:53] <veQue> not weird at all
[20:11:58] <RukaPHP> ow
[20:12:07] <monk3y> :/
[20:12:19] <RukaPHP> wierd problem
[20:12:23] <veQue> so, monk3y relax a bit on the couch
[20:12:27] <monk3y> For  . ... for some reason . .... I've got an IRC 'emotion' script, picking up a lot of sarcasm . . .
[20:12:30] <veQue> tell me me about your childhood
[20:13:11] <monk3y> Uh . .. ok . . well .. ... the first thing I can remember of my childhood .. was the monks giving me an Atari, then a Tandy 1000 "supercomputer" . . .
[20:14:30] <veQue> so you feel a personal relationship with technology
[20:15:10] <monk3y> Personal relationship?  That makes it sound so clinical.  Technology is my soul-mate.  It's .. the one.  No; it's .. the one-one-oh-one-oh-oh-oh-one.
[20:16:00] <veQue> indeed
[20:16:46] <veQue> such a revelation
[20:16:55] <veQue> well carry on enjoy sir monk3y

[20:40:00] <draginx> Is there a way to see whcih element i went into that triggered a blur event?
[20:45:26] <versatiletech> ? event.target draginx
[20:45:27] <monk3y> Should be $().blur(function(eventElement){}); // == eventElement
[20:45:29] <bot-t> versatiletech, Couldn't find "event.target draginx" in jQuery Docs.
[20:45:45] <draginx> hmm let me see if target works :)
[20:45:46] <versatiletech> draginx: http://api.jquery.com/event.target/?
[20:46:22] <monk3y> :/
[20:47:49] <draginx> no target is not whaty i want

[21:06:53] <digicyc> building this countdown app and running into the fun of dealing with different timezone :(
[21:07:30] <coldhead> native JS datetime is just about the worst thing in the world
[21:07:42] <digicyc> lol god.. So glad someone agrees with me
[21:08:18] <coldhead> anyone who has ever had to use new Date() would agree
[21:08:27] <coldhead> 0-based months? PUHLEASE
[21:08:40] <digicyc> lol

[21:12:26] <Jerrry> Yeah, I really want to know what happens next.

[21:27:41] <quantalrabbit> I want to select all the the stuff in between td tags.  Is there an easy way to do that?
[21:30:31] <Imaginativeone> how do I parse an xml document with jQuery?
[21:30:46] <Imaginativeone> am I forced to use XPath?
[21:32:13] <coldhead> hi MiracleBlue
[21:32:27] <coldhead> quantalrabbit: $('td *')
[21:32:32] <coldhead> is that what you mean?
[21:33:35] <coldhead> bot-t: tell Imaginativeone IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE
[21:33:35] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[21:33:56] <coldhead> bot-t: can you also tell him he's a jerk?

[21:35:38] <GoSox> am i the only one that has a real pain in the ass of a time integrating google maps into pages?
[21:36:14] <coldhead> no GoSox, i share your pain
[21:36:15] <quantalrabbit> coldhead: sorry, i wasn't clear.  i have a jquery selector such as $('td') .  i actually want the innerHTML of each 'td' conveniently in a list.
[21:36:55] <coldhead> $('td').map(function () { return this.innerHTML; }).get()
[21:37:05] <GoSox> coldhead: its like, i can do almost anything on my own in js these days. all sorts of fancy javascript and jquery trickery. Then I try to use google's "easy" API and i end up scratching my head for hours
[21:37:28] <coldhead> i think their API was designed by a Java guy
[21:38:20] <tw2113> i use leaflet.js
[21:39:53] <coldhead> oh this looks nice
[21:40:38] <Whirl3d> Anybody have any suggestions for creating a widget that operates like this: http://www.crossfitnoquarter.com/assets/img/dateSelector-mockup.png

[21:52:10] <aqeel> hi room
[21:52:29] <coldhead> hey aqeel
[21:52:55] <coldhead> aqeel: consider sometimes writing "hi channel", for variety
[21:53:16] <aqeel> if we have a method that takes an argument, if we provide wrong or false value, should that methods return null and do nothing or provide the error message
[21:53:59] <aqeel> sure...next time i will break this streak of mine..
[21:54:04] <coldhead> that's a very deep question, aqeel
[21:54:27] <coldhead> it depends on who will see the error message
[21:54:38] <coldhead> and it depends how catastrophic "silent failure" is
[21:57:08] <aqeel> so it must do nothing an d error out, so for the plugin to be 100% functional
[21:57:30] <coldhead> think of your audience
[21:57:38] <coldhead> if you're some guy trying to get a slideshow working
[21:57:44] <coldhead> and it doesn't
[21:57:51] <coldhead> with no error message or anything
[21:57:56] <coldhead> that sucks
[21:58:14] <coldhead> here's someone saying much the same thing http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/03/03/the-art-of-throwing-javascript-errors/
[21:59:14] <sacho> Imagine if an error popped up with a message that said, this function failed because this happened. <-- imagine if you were using actual developer tools and not ie6
[21:59:17] <trinadh> a plugin when used by some developer he would like to have a message saying what the problem is, but a user wont like to get an error message because of a code issue.
[21:59:47] <sacho> Throwing errors in your JavaScript is arguably more valuable than in any other language due to the difficulties around debugging. <-- no.
[21:59:59] <aqeel> hi trinadh ...you online
[22:00:21] <trinadh> aqueel: yes.. got in a couple of min's before
[22:00:27] <coldhead> i guess if you want to throw an error in JS it should be important and have some useful information
[22:01:00] <sacho> that article is just old. I can't really claim I remember what browser state was in 2009, but if you're having problems debugging your js, adding throw-printfs isntead of regular printfs is just a bandaid instead of using something like chrome's debugger.
[22:01:05] <coldhead> although i do have a soft spot for some cow orker code that logs console.error("THis is test")
[22:01:49] <coldhead> yes sacho, i was just trying to keep aqeel busy with taht link, i didn't mean for you to waste your precious time on it
[22:02:05] <aqeel> haha
[22:02:19] <GoSox> coldhead: yeah i think it's not so much that the googlemaps api sucks, as it is the documentation sucks. sure there's a lot of it, but it's not clear and not easy to find what you need, or to even identify if something you've found IS what you need or not
[22:03:15] <aqeel> by the way coldhead i did c/c++/java.....but not like this doing with javascript...
[22:03:26] <trinadh> well my personal opinion is something like this, while developing a plugin use console.log() to debug, while providing it for others to use document properly and provide default values, for a user he doen't needs to know what plugin is used..
[22:03:48] <trinadh> this is regarding plugins
[22:03:49] <coldhead> i wasn't urinating on your competence, aqeel
[22:04:05] <coldhead> javascript isn't like any other popular languages, it's weird
[22:04:14] <coldhead> and kind of hideous
[22:04:25] <coldhead> oops, wrong window
[22:06:02] <aqeel> well trinadh this is whyi asked, if someone puts wrong or false value, should the plugin throw an error
[22:06:23] <coldhead> this might be a more modern perspective on JS error handling http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter5.html
[22:10:18] <trinadh> aqueel: most of the plugins i know do nothing, they fail silently, but since i know it isn't working, i take a look at the documentation and figure out how to use it..
[22:10:48] <kryl> hi, how to add fresh new jquery code to the new page after using $.mobile.changePage ?
[22:10:57] <kryl> if it is possible !
[22:13:40] <trinadh> aqueel: so for a good plugin good documentation is essential
[22:14:21] <aqeel> agreen
[22:14:26] <aqeel> agreed*
[22:15:02] <coldhead> my app has good documentation but no one ever reads it http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos
[22:24:53] <GoSox> php docs <3
[22:25:14] <Jerrry> No one talks in this room.
[22:26:58] <coldhead> i have no mouth and i must scream?
[22:27:18] <Jerrry> Very deep. Did you come up with that?
[22:28:15] <coldhead> no, it's the title of a short story
[22:28:39] <Jerrry> Seems familiar.
[22:31:03] <trinadh> kryl: jquerymobiledictionary.pl/faq.html , see if it helps you
[22:34:16] <coldhead> is this yours trinadh ?
[22:35:17] <trinadh> coldhead: didn't get you
[22:35:31] <coldhead> the FAQ you just linked
[22:35:40] <coldhead> are you the owner/operator
[22:35:40] <trinadh> no..
[22:35:47] <trinadh> am not..
[22:35:51] <coldhead> very good, please carry on
[22:35:56] <coldhead> thank you for clearing that up
[22:36:40] <trinadh> ok.. any issues with that link.. ?
[22:37:02] <coldhead> no! just wondering who was responsible
[22:38:03] <GoSox> i'm going to try that leaflet openmap thing, because googlemaps api will waste as much of my time as i'm willing to give it
[22:38:37] <coldhead> somewhere there is a $500/hr google maps consultant
[22:39:13] <hypnotoaddd> Does anyone know if theres any examples of using the jquery ui menu to replace the right click context menu?
[22:39:42] <GoSox> i feel like i could create my own maps app from scratch about as easy is I could figure out how to do everything i want to do with a google map on my page. which isnt' a hell of a lot, but it seems like in API code, it's super complicated
[22:42:09] <trinadh> GoSox: well, i don't know about creating one from scratch, I use OpenLayers all the time.
[22:42:11] <WebDragon> GoSox: there's interesting things you can do with the version that displays only a static map on the page instead of an interactive one
[22:42:42] <GoSox> trinadh: is that this leaflet thing?
[22:42:43] <WebDragon> I used that API for www.mainstreetcourt.com/location.php
[22:43:51] <WebDragon> the reason why I used this method was for the responsive design
[22:44:52] <coldhead> mercy me the night is long
[22:44:57] <WebDragon> iframes aren't all that responsive friendly unless you use lightboxes for 'em
[22:45:34] <trinadh> GoSox: no, its older than leaflet, powerful and huge
[22:45:55] <trinadh> http://openlayers.org
[22:46:27] <WebDragon> coldhead: it gets even longer once your roommate realizes you've put netflix on the xbox360 and starts watching all his childhood cartoons up to and including my little pony, veggie tales, etc, and totally screws up the selection of movies you've been carefully grooming netflix to select for and offer to you in the little strips *sigh*
[22:47:35] <WebDragon> there isn't enough facepalm left for what netflix has been queueing up for me lately -- they really need to institute some location-based accounts to group ones selections with
[22:47:45] <rindolf> Hi all. Can anyone tell me why the nav menu on this page - http://www.shlomifish.org/__good_jqtree_UKO/without-ajax/bad/ - behaves differently from that one - http://www.shlomifish.org/__good_jqtree_UKO/with-ajax-call/bad/
[22:47:47] <rindolf> WebDragon: hi.
[22:47:53] <WebDragon> heya rindolf :)
[22:48:21] <rindolf> WebDragon: what's up?
[22:48:51] <rindolf> WebDragon: I've ran into a JavaScript/jQuery/CSS conundrum.
[22:49:08] <WebDragon> nada mas other than the above, and having to reverse-engineer a more formal SQL database spec from the client's initial *cough* spec
[22:49:56] <WebDragon> rindolf: you talking about the little red arrows that almost-but-not-quite show up in the first one on Opera ?
[22:51:39] <WebDragon> plus you seem to have done something that prevents me from right-click-menu choosing "Inspect Element"
[22:51:52] <rindolf> WebDragon: well, in Firefox and Chromium (didn't check Opera yet but I can), in one of them the lines are not continuus and in the other the togglers/expanders/collapsers are jumpy.
[22:52:05] <rindolf> WebDragon: that seems to be a problem with the jQtree plugin.
[22:53:53] <WebDragon> the togglers/expanders seem pretty smooth here on Opera
[22:54:42] <WebDragon> eliminate .jqtree-tree .hover {color: red;} and .treeview .hover { color: red; } and the arrows should go away
[22:55:36] <rindolf> WebDragon: http://www.shlomifish.org/__good_jqtree_UKO/with-ajax-call/bad/ - not here.
[22:55:59] <rindolf> WebDragon: thanks! But that's not my main problem now.
[22:56:08] <WebDragon> yeah I see the breaks on -with-ajax-call
[22:56:15] <rindolf> WebDragon: http://www.shlomifish.org/__good_jqtree_UKO/with-ajax-call/bad/ - not here (in Opera or wherever - they jump).
[22:56:22] <WebDragon> the red parts are showing up on without-ajax
[22:56:27] <rindolf> Apparently, there are different classes in both places.
[22:56:43] <WebDragon> hm
[22:57:01] <rindolf> I mean CSS class="..." classes.
[22:57:08] <WebDragon> whatever's going on that prevents right-click menu from working makes it difficult to do the 'inspect element' thing
[22:58:17] <WebDragon> on without-ajax-call I'm also seeing some image artifacts spaced out beyond the area of the [+]'s but not the [-]'s
[23:00:03] <rindolf> WebDragon: can you try using Opera Dragonfly?
[23:00:31] <WebDragon> also why not html5 ? :)
[23:01:13] <WebDragon> yeah that's what I was using -- can get in there with the debug menu. it's just *easier* to be able to right-click inspect element so I can go straight to the source of the issue (and whether hovered or not) in dragonfly
[23:03:04] <WebDragon> if you're using xhtml 1.1 you need to CDATA escape your js in the footer
[23:04:03] <rindolf> WebDragon: well, it's served as .html.
[23:04:10] <rindolf> I mean text/html .
[23:05:02] <WebDragon> yeah but you could probably transition painlessly to html5
[23:05:17] <WebDragon> I can't see any reason you'd NEED xhtml for that :)
[23:05:38] <WebDragon> and these days, the only reason to USE xhtml is if you actually NEED it
[23:08:06] <GoSox> someone needs to tell openstreetmap that Boston is the capital of Massachusetts, not Cambridge
[23:08:34] <WebDragon> lol
[23:09:18] <WebDragon> dunno what to tell you WRT the spacings on some of the lines in the 2nd example, rindolf :\
[23:09:25] * WebDragon *scratches his head*
[23:09:26] <coldhead> if only it were in some way open
[23:11:35] <rindolf> WebDragon: I found out what the problem was!
[23:11:44] <WebDragon> :o
[23:11:47] <WebDragon> what was it?
[23:11:52] <rindolf> WebDragon: apparently I loaded an older JS that competed with the new one.
[23:12:00] <khurram> Can we extend jQuery prototype and new function into it ?
[23:12:03] <rindolf> WebDragon: the old was treeview and the new was jqTree.
[23:12:05] * WebDragon passes a fresh can of facepalm to rindolf 
[23:12:15] <WebDragon> :D
[23:12:22] <khurram> i.e  $.prototype.something = function (){ return 'im something as well';}
[23:12:23] <coldhead> khurram: $.fn.new_thing = function () {}
[23:12:36] <khurram> you are always the champ
[23:12:46] <coldhead> well, let's see if it works first :)
[23:13:28] <WebDragon> rindolf: well, cool. and on that note I gotta go lay down.. back is spasming again (twisted it somehow last night and still haven't quite fully recovered)
[23:13:47] <WebDragon> 'night folks }B=&]
[23:14:14] <coldhead> gnight WD
[23:15:36] <rindolf> WebDragon: good night.
[23:15:39] <rindolf> WebDragon: and thanks.
[23:28:01] <DarkMukke_> my .on function is not working like .live() used to work, as in : i have to rebind elements after they have been created, afaik .live() did that just fine
[23:29:04] <DarkMukke_> according to the docs i should no longer use.live() and use .on() instead
[23:37:50] <aqeel> DarkMukke_: you might be one of those millions fall for same mistakes
[23:37:57] <DarkMukke_> yeh
[23:38:01] <DarkMukke_> i think i got it
[23:38:24] <DarkMukke_> have to do delegated $(document).on(), right ?
[23:39:01] <aqeel> yessssssss
[23:39:10] <DarkMukke_> :D
[23:39:16] <aqeel> but prefer parent container instead of document
[23:39:31] <DarkMukke_> ah, good call
[23:40:00] <DarkMukke_> its a selfcontaining jQuery plugin, so parent element is better
[23:42:47] <w00tner> can anyone helpme with a real noob issue its css but i get no answer in css chan... i just want to show the divs in their position inside the div: http://jsfiddle.net/NtCxN/
[23:44:23] <DarkMukke_> w00tner: even if i wanted to help, i have no idea what you are asking
[23:50:23] <Whirl3d> Never once did I think I would be answering questions in #CSS. LOL
[23:50:35] <tw2113> someone has to
[23:50:42] <granden> Hi, is there any nice plugin to filter a dropdown list in a form? With like a search-box. Got like 3000 options in it now. So would like the user to be able to filter it by searching for a string in a input field as well?
[23:50:48] <Whirl3d> I just helped two people, shockingly enough. LOL
[23:51:04] <tw2113> documented proof that at least 2 people have been helped in there
[23:51:13] <Whirl3d> right. LOL
[23:51:29] <Whirl3d> granden, you might want autocomplete field types like in jquery UI
[23:51:56] <Whirl3d> where you type the first couple of letters and drop down list appears with results filtered based on your input?
[23:52:06] <aqeel> w00tner: http://jsfiddle.net/NtCxN/7/
[23:52:15] <granden> That sounds good.
[23:52:27] <granden> autocomplete in jquery ui was it?
[23:52:50] <Whirl3d> aqeel, he just needed float:left
[23:53:14] <aqeel> ok, i though he asked nested div, div in div
[23:53:17] <Whirl3d> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[23:53:25] <Whirl3d> ^ granden
[23:54:08] <Whirl3d> There are less bulky autocomplete options, but at least you know what to look for. Rather than drop down, you want to find AutoComplete most likely.
[23:54:33] <granden> Whirl3d: Hmm, a quick question just. Want that just be a normal text-input then? I want a dorpdown? As I want that options ID to be the value sent in the form?
[23:55:19] <Whirl3d> granden, check the examples to make sure the thing you want isn't covered.
[23:55:39] <granden> Ah, missed those.
[23:55:41] <Whirl3d> like the custom data and display option
[23:55:46] <granden> To early in the morning :)
[23:56:00] <Whirl3d> tell me about it it's 3 am here.
[23:56:10] <granden> 9 am here...
[23:56:25] <granden> usually get in to office by this time. Not been here for 5 hours.
