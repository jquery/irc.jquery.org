[00:01:47] <Hilton> Yay I did it!
[00:02:05] <Hilton> Now, is there a better way? :P
[00:02:57] <Hilton> Screw it, it works.
[01:14:18] <Kanika> Hi Sir
[01:14:52] <ericelliott> hi
[01:16:12] <Kanika> I am using a datepicker from your forum by using jquery.datepick.css, jquery.datepick.js and jquery.min.js
[01:17:25] <Kanika> here I want to increase the default year range from c-10:c+10 to c-20:c+20
[01:18:03] <Kanika> how can i chage this value
[01:20:13] <Kanika> I am using a datepicker from your forum by using jquery.datepick.css, jquery.datepick.js and jquery.min.js.  here I want to increase the default year range from c-10:c+10 to c-20:c+20. how can i chage this value
[01:21:55] <raj> does jqui have any method for making a div collapsible?
[01:21:59] <raj> ...by adding a button
[01:22:03] <raj> to the desired side
[01:22:20] <Kanika> no
[01:24:17] <Kanika> I chage the default value c-10:c+10 to c-20:c+20 in the Datepicker () function of jquery.datepick.js file
[01:24:37] <Kanika> but it is unchanged
[01:41:28] <sunuslee> hi, is anything wrong with this code ? http://fpaste.org/cOOL/  i using firebug to debug it, and the callback didn't get executed . i didn't received the json data
[01:55:39] <spobat> hi
[01:55:59] <spobat> can you give me some improvement suggestions on this code? http://jsfiddle.net/zdnJG/
[01:57:25] <spobat> especially the thing with the button looks quite awkward, I think. What's your opinion?
[01:57:55] <bluesm> Would it be cross browser :  $formSummary.find("input[type=submit]")     ?
[02:01:46] <didiergm> sunuslee are you sure the url exists and seen as executable by the web server ?
[02:02:32] <didiergm> bluesm yes I think do JQ should iron out any browser difference if/when they exist
[02:03:27] <didiergm> e/think do/think so/
[02:05:16] <bluesm> Ok thanks :)
[02:05:52] <bluesm> I have another question, IS that improve performance  ?   ->   $formSummary.find("#r5-reservation-button")
[02:06:11] <bluesm> I mean this versus $("#r5-reservation-button")
[02:07:18] <didiergm> bluesm I would have thought that direct ID pick is faster; I imagine browser keep a table of ids somewhere and they can do a fast search
[02:07:47] <didiergm> whilst with the find the have to traverse the DOM, pick all elements in the form and then only check
[02:08:14] <didiergm> should be fairly easy to run a comparison on 1000 selects and time it
[02:11:13] <bluesm> didiergm: Ok I will jspref it, (assuming that I have   $formSummary already defined fore earlier usage)
[02:16:06] <bluesm> http://jsperf.com/id-versus-id-in-container  @ didiergm
[02:16:10] <bluesm> Seems you are right.
[02:17:15] <didiergm> bluesm pffeeww :)
[02:17:52] <bluesm> didiergm: ?
[02:18:23] <didiergm> bluesm when you said 'seems you are right' I let a sigh of relief ;)
[02:19:23] <bluesm> didiergm: Chill out :] Sometimes it's better to be wrong to learn more :]
[02:19:59] <didiergm> bluesm np I was only joking
[02:20:25] <bluesm> didiergm:  Thank you for you time :]
[02:20:53] <didiergm> bluesm I am just trying to give a bit back to this excellent ciommunity
[02:25:40] <bluesm> didiergm: Although if unfortunately there would be two the SAME IDs  then it will work as you expect.
[02:25:55] <bluesm> http://jsbin.com/iyohar/1   @ didiergm
[02:26:03] <bluesm> Try $("#k")
[02:26:14] <bluesm> $("#first").find("#k")
[02:26:21] <bluesm> $("#second").find("#k")
[02:26:26] <bluesm> $("#third").find("#k")
[02:26:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a form that keeps doing a post eventhough I didn't add it in the form tag... I want it to preventdefault, which I do... but it still reloads the page
[02:26:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> <form class="default" id="registerform">
[02:27:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if(e.preventDefault) e.preventDefault(); else e.returnValue = false;
[02:27:02] <didiergm> bluesm - have to identical IDS is illegal.
[02:27:04] <triptec> is there anyone who got a solution for jqm where you use json data to create a page, say category but then need to switch to another category, do you create a new page on the fly and then delete the old one?
[02:27:06] <bluesm> didiergm: I suspect that using "find" could be done by simple "traversing"
[02:27:23] <didiergm> bluesm I meant two to to
[02:27:41] <didiergm> bluesm ouch I meant two not to
[02:27:45] <bluesm> didiergm: I know. but you never know when you write "snippet" for others websites :]
[02:28:18] <didiergm> bluesm that's why with a form I always prepend my ids with the form id. sort of namespace
[02:29:06] <didiergm> bluesm and outside a form I prepend the ids with the app's id
[02:29:30] <didiergm> bluesm then it is easy to "recalculate" should the need arise
[02:29:55] <didiergm> bluesm this is particularly important in jquery Mobile where you laod portion of pages
[02:30:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It just sends me to register/?tb_username=zgzegezg&tb_email=&tb_password=
[02:30:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so annoying
[02:31:01] <bluesm> didiergm:  you mean that you don "prefixes" before your ids ?
[02:31:16] <bluesm> didiergm: Prefixes that are not likely to occur anywhere else.
[02:32:22] <didiergm> Bluesm yes say I have a form for clients & one for contacts. The name field exists in both the "name" of the input will  be "name" but the ids will be client_name & contact_name
[02:32:55] <didiergm> bluesm this way I never have conflicts; save with Save or delete buttons.
[02:33:32] <didiergm> bluesm to attach event when I know the form id, it is trivial to attach a function to save to the correct button
[02:34:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> anyone?
[02:41:26] <bluesm> didiergm: Ok. Thank you very much :]
[03:06:55] <bluesm> I there in jquery something like "onclick" ? I mean that wen you overwrite it the earlier function will go away ?
[03:09:40] <bluesm> Or I do have do   .off("click")  then assign new one ?
[03:14:24] <triptec> is there anyone who have used jqm router?
[03:15:00] <triptec> I cat get it to work with directly going to a route, I always get the index
[03:42:12] <Bora> hello guys
[03:55:52] <raj> shoky?
[03:56:32] <shoky> ey
[03:56:49] <shoky> raj^
[03:57:44] <raj> good day sir
[03:57:54] <raj> wait, no, that's bye in british i think
[03:58:04] <raj> top of the morn' mate
[03:58:13] <raj> right, anyway...
[03:58:18] <shoky> ... hi
[03:58:26] <shoky> feed_me.
[03:58:30] <shoky> plz kthx
[03:58:38] <shoky> also, sup
[04:02:36] <fuzai> "$(document).ready(function() {" and "$(function() {" are they the same thing?
[04:03:02] <fuzai> or is one instant, and the other is waiting for the DOM to be ready?
[04:03:12] <shoky> same
[04:03:59] <fuzai> is that the same story if the later one is wrapped in a function as well?
[04:05:21] <shoky> nothing special about being wrapped in a function
[04:05:40] <fuzai> ok
[04:05:56] <fuzai> I made this work, i'm just trying to understand exactly what i did here :)
[04:06:20] <fuzai> ty
[04:07:19] <WillPittenger> I have a jquery call returning an array of elements from an XML document.  Is there a way I can have them sorted by an attribute?
[04:08:10] <shoky> you can sort arrays with .sort(...)
[04:10:13] <WillPittenger> A selector like "b:sort(a)" would be better.
[04:10:53] <shoky> if you say so
[04:43:01] <carloratm> hi all
[04:43:29] <carloratm> what's the simplest free image gallery plugin compatible with latest jquery?
[04:45:17] <carloratm> simplest == less markup, no particular features needed
[04:53:09] <ph88> how do i add/change event triggers   when the slider has already been created ??  http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[04:54:12] <shoky> ph88: like the examples show http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-change
[04:54:29] <shoky> $( ".selector" ).on( "slidechange", function( event, ui ) {} );
[05:13:56] <kiuma> hello
[05:15:20] <kiuma> I need a function to be called after every external script has been loaded, $(document).ready seems not to accomplish this task, how can I do ?
[05:49:56] <WillPittenger> What is the best way to use .post to send data that has UUID values as the name of each parameter?  I have a series of HTML input fields.  The name attribute of the input field holds the UUID.  The value of the input field is the value of the parameter.  Each UUID will be a mix of letters, digits, and dashes.
[05:50:26] <ph88> thx shoky
[05:51:01] <WillPittenger> I should note that my form isn't a true form.  It has input controls and little else.
[05:51:56] <shoky> ?serialize
[05:51:57] <bot-t1> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[05:55:50] <WillPittenger> shoky: It will accept dashes in those names properly?
[05:57:19] <shoky> WillPittenger: think so
[05:57:29] <WillPittenger> Thanks.
[06:20:38] <bluesm> Hey. How to prevent .fadeIn() to make my element "display:inline"

[06:44:00] <patchon> hi guys, im not familiar with jquery/html/css/ajax so go easy on me while asking this, im trying to do an ajaxrequest when  a page is loading, and while its loading im trying to show a spinner, i've pasted my examplecode http://fpaste.org/MD4j/
[06:44:16] <patchon> really appriate any input
[06:48:33] <patchon> problem is that #foo shows up after the page is loaded
[06:49:11] <shoky> patchon: then make foo visible in the initial css
[06:49:25] <shoky> and don't use async:false
[06:51:38] <patchon> shoky, ty

[08:42:29] <bluesm> Hi is there a better way to toggle my "events" ?
[08:42:29] <bluesm> https://gist.github.com/bluesm/5326536
[09:38:16] <bluesm> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js
[09:38:26] <bluesm> Should be faster than my server ?
[09:38:42] <bluesm> Is such "outsourcing" make sense?
[10:06:25] <limpc> bluesm: its only faster if the user has visited another site which uses it.
[10:06:43] <limpc> but really the file isnt that large. so at the end of the day it doesnt make any difference
[10:09:02] <bluesm> limpc:  Uh.
[10:09:30] <bluesm> limpc: So this is the standard  http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js  (that a lot of pages use)
[10:09:51] <bluesm> limpc: And because of that there is likely that browser have this in his cache ? Right ?
[10:09:59] <limpc> right.
[10:10:19] <bluesm> limpc: This is the most popular one http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js   ?
[10:10:35] <bluesm> limpc: because I saw also something from Google... :]
[10:10:36] <limpc> its the latest version
[10:10:45] <limpc> google should also have 1.9.1
[10:11:09] <bluesm> limpc: But which is more popular ? I mean which is more likely to be in user's cache :]
[10:11:16] <bluesm> limpc: Statistically :]]
[10:11:19] <limpc> i dont know which one is more "popular" - i dont think theres info on that
[10:11:29] <limpc> but it doesnt really matter :P
[10:11:30] <tw2113> i still prefer local files
[10:11:41] <bluesm> tw2113:  'couse ?
[10:11:52] <tw2113> personal preference
[10:12:21] <tw2113> especially when requests take too long to external sites
[10:13:09] <limpc> bluesm: the user is only going to experience a brief delay on the INITIAL page load. Then it's cached.. so where it's hosted doesnt really matter in the long run
[10:14:37] <limpc> the one benefit is if they frequently visit other websites which use the same library source.  Then the file doesnt expire from cache and require a download when they visit your site again
[10:16:22] <bluesm> limpc: then the file doesnt expire from cache and "DONT" require a download
[10:16:29] <bluesm> limpc: Right ?
[10:20:55] <enerel> hello all,
[10:21:28] <enerel> JQM i want to create tab menu with content, can i do it with radio?
[10:22:48] <limpc> bluesm: right
[10:25:50] <bluesm> limpc: I have on more question.  If such a "script" is cached by browser (I know it could depend on browser)  it is cached as a STRING, and every time, website require this script browser have to interpret this script again  OR it is already interpreted ?
[10:26:37] <limpc> its cached on disk, and it will have to reparse the script each time the page is loaded
[10:27:23] <bluesm> limpc: The question is why this couldn't be already interpreted?
[10:27:39] <limpc> you'd eat up enormous amounts of memory
[10:28:57] <bluesm> limpc: Ok. I see, thank you very very much :)

[11:41:19] <tucan> hi, im new to jquery and need some explanation for this line of code: var id = $(".tab").index(this);
[11:42:34] <tucan> if im understanding it correctly, it selects all elements with the css class of "tab" and grabs the index value
[11:43:00] <tucan> which seems like multiple values, or could be
[11:43:11] <tucan> but left side is scalar, no?

[11:49:53] <larzen> I have an offtopic question.. Firebug lets me view on-the-fly styles as they are applied using :hover and such. There is no such functionality in Chrome that I can see... Can anyone advise?
[11:52:19] <larzen> furthermore, is there a chrome tool to see which objects have been attached to elements?
[12:10:16] <wookiehangover> yes
[12:10:31] <wookiehangover> go here: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/
[12:10:34] <wookiehangover> read the manual
[12:11:15] <tucan> i feel like i need to get a better understanding of "this" keyword
[12:12:51] <wookiehangover> tucan: step 1, buy Effective JavaScript by Dave Herman
[12:13:23] <wookiehangover> step 2, play around with your own code
[12:14:18] <wookiehangover> step 3, remember that jQuery almost always sets `this` to be something different than it otherwise would be... eg, a reference to the node you've chained off of
[12:17:14] <rk88> Hello everyone, I know this might not be the best place to ask, but I am porting my jQuery web-app to mobile, therefore using a lighter alternative: jqmobi. I am facing the following problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15854428/jquery-mobile-to-jqmobi-element-creation can anybody help me? thanks in advance.
[12:26:35] <tucan> OH
[12:26:46] <rk88> ??
[12:26:47] <tucan> ok ill get the book
[12:27:36] <wookiehangover> rk88: don't use jqmobi
[12:27:41] <wookiehangover> just don't
[12:28:14] <wookiehangover> its a shitty clone of zepto that was used in a marketing scheme to get VC $$$
[12:28:20] <wookiehangover> just use jquery
[12:28:50] <rk88> I am actually in the process of finding a (fast) javascript library that's good for mobile
[12:29:02] <rk88> yes. I do LOVE jquery but isn't it a bit too heavy for mobile?
[12:31:04] <amcsi> jquery is heavy?
[12:33:42] <wookiehangover> use 1 less jpeg
[12:33:45] <wookiehangover> and no
[12:34:08] <amcsi> why is jqmobi bad?
[12:35:08] <wookiehangover> because its a subpar fork of a jquery clone, zepto. it's only designed for webkit and isn't faithful to the jQuery api, which causes confusion for folks like yourself
[12:36:42] <wookiehangover> so, since no one actually uses it for realsies, but like 50% of the internet uses jquery, they in effect get to ride on jquery's coattails without providing nearly the consistency and battle-testedness that jquery does
[12:36:51] <wookiehangover> it's like buying a chinese "rolex"
[12:37:07] <wookiehangover> sure it tells time, but not that well and probably not for very long
[12:37:14] <wookiehangover> and its cheap and light and shitty
[12:37:32] <amcsi> I see your point
[12:37:48] <rk88> lol
[12:38:13] <amcsi> I'd rather use something that's well tested, but figure out how to get additional stuff working, than something that's inconsistent
[12:38:29] <rk88> but don't you agree that for web-apps jquery is a bit slow?
[12:38:38] <wookiehangover> and the difference in size is literally less than like 1 jpeg
[12:38:44] <wookiehangover> rk88: no
[12:39:17] <amcsi> I personally wouldn't see how
[12:39:53] <wookiehangover> why would it be slow for web-apps
[12:39:57] <amcsi> jQuery uses an extension of arrays for jQuery objects, and then any method call is 3 native calls
[12:39:59] <amcsi> that's itr
[13:06:22] <gordian> guys i'm using a lazy image loading plugin and i'd like to display an animated loading gif instead of just the placholder specified in the src attribute

[13:06:42] <gordian> i'd appreciate any help or suggestions
[13:29:57] <bluesm> Is there a library that search for jquery
[13:29:58] <raj> what's the most efficient way to check if an element has any of a list of classes?
[13:30:01] <bluesm> on particular element ?
[13:30:19] <raj> bluesm, what does that mean?
[13:30:30] <bluesm> I have to make the snippet that should use the already assigned library or append my own...
[13:32:01] <bluesm> raj: Maybe $myElement.attr("class")
[13:33:03] <raj> bluesm, I still don't know what you're asking
[13:34:28] <bluesm> raj: var classes = $myEl.attr("class")  if(typeof  classes = "undefined"  || classes === "")
[13:34:58] <bluesm> raj:  I ask about library that I pass the URL (say google.com) and check if there is a jquery assigned and which version.
[13:35:26] <Andrew_R> bluesm: $myElement.hasClass('class') will tell you if an element has a specific class
[13:36:16] <bluesm> Andrew_R: raj asked about ->  if an element has any of a list of classes
[13:36:41] <Andrew_R> oops sorry
[13:37:40] <tw2113> jQuery.fn.jquery will return the version
[13:37:48] <tw2113> or undefined
[13:38:32] <tw2113> bluesm,
[13:41:07] <bluesm>  raj: (but I'm not an expert)
[13:41:07] <Andrew_R> bluesm: if you could figure out how to get the source, you could search for all <script> tags and see if the src attribute contains jquery
[13:41:32] <Andrew_R> but doing that client side has some issues, like cross-domain scripting restrictions
[13:41:41] <Andrew_R> it might be better to do this on the server side
[13:45:43] <bluesm>  Andrew_R: I only check if there is jQuery then i provide snippet with jQuery or not.
[13:45:50] <Zzaichik> this should effect all child elements as well shouldn't it?  $('.image-carousel').hover(function() { â€¦ }):
[13:46:47] <Andrew_R> Zzaichik: nope, only elements with the image-carousel class
[13:47:25] <Zzaichik> really? weak! So how would you rewrite that to effect that element and than also all children()
[13:47:39] <Zzaichik> $('.image-carousel').children().hover(function() { â€¦ });
[13:49:10] <Andrew_R> .children() wont match the .image-carousel elements, and only goes one level deep
[13:49:27] <Andrew_R> maybe $('.image-carousel, .image-carousel *').hover(function);
[13:51:00] <Andrew_R> you can combine multiple things into 1 selector, and the .image-carousel * would match every descendant of .image-carousel
[13:52:02] <Andrew_R> bluesm: is this code that other people can place on their own website?
[13:54:20] <bluesm> Andrew_R: Yes.
[13:54:42] <bluesm> Andrew_R: And It's for regular person who know something about html.
[13:57:58] <Andrew_R> If you really need to have a regular version and a jquery version, I'd put a checkbox saying "Use jQuery version" on your page where they get the snippet
[13:58:10] <Andrew_R> your other 2 options are to just always use the non-jquery version
[13:58:30] <Andrew_R> or write your snippet so it uses jquery if it's available and non-jquery code if it's not
[13:59:06] <Andrew_R> I don't think trying to scrape their site to see if they are using jquery will be that reliable
[13:59:47] <tw2113> the jQuery.fn.jquery check would be more reliable
[14:02:03] <Andrew_R> agreed, or even just if(jQuery) { // run jquery code } else { // do non-jquery code }
[14:02:22] <Andrew_R> is there any benefit to the user to have the jQuery version over the non-jQuery version?
[14:18:06] <HS^> hi, ehm.. the themes radio buttons dont work in IE7, IE8 is that right?

[14:38:18] <HS^> any1 here?
[14:38:30] <HS^> 827 people idle?
[14:38:36] <JesperA> yeah
[14:38:42] <Zzaichik> just kind of idle
[14:38:52] <HS^> ok
[14:39:17] <HS^> can you tell me if theres a way for jquery radiobuttons to become round in ie7 and ie8
[14:39:21] <HS^> iinstead of square
[14:45:41] <tw2113> i thought radio buttons were round by default
[14:45:58] <Gazpacho> the plain HTML ones are
[14:46:02] <Gazpacho> so why not use those
[14:50:43] <solancer> I'm trying to port forward on my ubuntu machine
[14:50:58] <solancer> but my ip address show in the router page and whatsip don't match!
[14:51:47] <Andrew_R> solancer: I think you're in the wrong room! :)
[14:52:29] <solancer> Andrew_R, ya i know
[15:03:35] <draginx> var html = '<textarea style="width:95%;height:400px;" id="file_contents">' + data.file + '</textarea>'; any idea why this code.. would turn "\n" into '<br />' within the textfield?
[15:03:57] <draginx> this is the JSON: {"file":"Yup this is just a test!\n\nyup"}
[15:04:02] <anew> shouldnt .form() submit the current form ?
[15:07:24] <Andrew_R> draginx: where does data.file come from?
[15:07:32] <draginx> from a nodejhs app but i got it :)
[15:07:48] <Andrew_R> anew: $('form').submit()
[15:07:48] <draginx> somewhere down the line someone made  a function replace newlines for <br>s for some reason in thr JS app >.>
[15:07:54] <draginx> so I need to go kill someone :)
[15:07:58] <Andrew_R> yep that will do it :p
[15:08:05] <draginx> lol thanks though man :)
[15:18:21] <h3nryturk> draginx: nl2bt()
[15:18:41] <h3nryturk> oh, nevermind. i read what you wrote wrong
[15:20:17] <js_doode> hello. Can I use the css method for my jquery in jfiddle?
[15:20:38] <js_doode> Having problems as the output is not the same as when tested in ffox.
[15:21:12] <js_doode> i mean jsfiddle
[15:30:56] <pepsi3> hi all
[15:49:02] <js_doode> http://jsfiddle.net/DCnn5/1/  ... first to links should appear red and turn green and underline when hover
[15:49:10] <js_doode> two links
[15:49:41] <js_doode> First problem: jquery not working in jsfiddle.
[15:53:10] <Andrew_R> js_doode: don't use the (function() { } ) wrapper in jsfiddle, that code already gets wrapped in a "ready"
[15:53:31] <js_doode> Andrew_R: thank you. i'll update
[15:53:47] <js_doode> Andrew_R: RTFM.. me.. I know.
[15:54:45] <js_doode> Andrew_R: thank you. solved jsfiddle issue.
[15:54:54] <anew> http://pastebin.com/qzEKGhkM
[15:55:00] <anew> can anyone help me with this i want to kill myself
[15:55:03] <js_doode> Andrew_R: now I'm a jquery beginner. I want
[15:55:15] <anew> line 25 is not submitting
[15:55:16] <Andrew_R> there is a drop down under the frameworks and extensions section and you have "onDomready" selected, which does the wrapping automatically
[15:55:20] <anew> i get the 'success'
[15:55:22] <js_doode> the hover to go away as soon as the mouse is not on the link
[15:55:23] <anew> but then line 25 does nothing
[15:56:17] <Andrew_R> anew: on line 2 you have event.preventDefault() which is stopping the submit() from doing anything
[15:56:39] <anew> yeah but if i take that out, the form submits immediately
[15:56:45] <anew> instead of checking the recaptcha
[15:57:02] <qom2> $(window).off('mousewheel').on('mousewheel', ep.events.scroll) how do I reset this so scroll goes back to normal?
[15:57:36] <Andrew_R> you could probably do return true on line 25, then in your submit() handler do if(!validateCaptcha()) event.preventDefault();
[15:58:33] <js_doode> http://jsfiddle.net/DCnn5/2/  Can anyone lead me to an example as to why
[15:58:50] <Andrew_R> js_doode: what do you mean by the hover going away?
[15:59:09] <Andrew_R> hover, as you are using it, does the first function on mouseover and the second function on mouseout
[15:59:16] <js_doode> Andrew_R: like in regular CSS where the user is not on the link
[15:59:33] <js_doode> Andrew_R: the link goes back to its normal state.
[15:59:52] <js_doode> Andrew_R: let me show an example
[15:59:58] <Andrew_R> Put all your changes you want on mouseover in the first function, then revert them to "normal" state in the second function
[16:00:06] <anew> ah jesus that worked
[16:00:10] <anew> not what i had before but it works
[16:00:14] <anew> 1:30 on this
[16:00:16] <anew> thanks andrewe
[16:00:20] <Andrew_R> :)
[16:03:58] <BOY77X> http://www.reddit.com/r/XXXEROSXXX/comments/1bthxk/taylor_rain_anal_slut_of_the_world/
[16:10:58] <jacoluta> Lets say I have element $('.element') and I want to do something with it. But it is not on every page, and I dont want to do anything with it unless it has been rendered. What is the best approach for something like this?
[16:11:30] <ner0x> Can anyone using the jQuery FileUploader suggest a good default for limitConcurrentUploads? Or is sequentialUpload: true a better option?
[16:16:19] <Andrew_R> jacoluta: if you do $('.element').something() and .element doesn't exist yet, it wont break anything, just nothing will happen
[16:16:57] <gordian> jacoluta: or you could do if ( $('.element').length > 0 )
[16:17:00] <Andrew_R> ner0x: most browsers have a default setting of 6 maximum HTTP requests at the same time, so if you tried to set concurrent uploads to more than 6, the browser would probably queue them anyway.
[16:18:16] <zeromodulus> Hey, I have this weird problem where if I don't let an animation complete, it becomes buggy.
[16:18:17] <jacoluta> gordian: It's not practical to check to make sure the element exists, when I have several elements in question?
[16:18:32] <zeromodulus> I'm using the .hover() method.
[16:18:53] <gordian> jacoluta: ok
[16:18:54] <zeromodulus> So, if I hover over the element, and I let the animation run to completion, nothing bugs out, it'll continue working.
[16:19:03] <jacoluta> gordian: ha that was suppose to be a question
[16:19:12] <zeromodulus> Then I can do it over and over again, and it will work as I intended it to.
[16:19:16] <zeromodulus> But...
[16:19:23] <gordian> jacoluta: it's a statment with a question mark at the end of it
[16:19:29] <zeromodulus> If I mouseout before the animation can finish, it'll start behaving wonky.
[16:19:50] <jacoluta> gordian: ha yea i failed pretty hard on that. I basically was just asking if it that is pratical when I have several elements in question
[16:19:52] <Andrew_R> jacoluta:  when do you want to do your "something()"? After it's loaded or is it a specific event you want to bind?
[16:19:55] <zeromodulus> Like, the animation will only be able to animate halfway.
[16:20:11] <zeromodulus> Or it'll start sliding out from somewhere completely different.
[16:20:19] <jacoluta> loaded i guess...
[16:20:29] <jacoluta> yea. there is no binding
[16:20:50] <gordian> jacoluta: i can't comment on practicality without seeing more of your code
[16:20:52] <Andrew_R> jacoluta: so whatever is loading it, can you put your code there?
[16:21:15] <Andrew_R> zeromodulus: is your mouseout event doing animations also?
[16:21:24] <zeromodulus> Yes, it's basically doing the reverse animation.
[16:21:32] <zeromodulus> Basically the same mouseover animation, but in reverse.
[16:21:34] <ner0x> Andrew_R: I'm thinking since I have a relatively small server sequential might be a better idea.
[16:21:49] <Andrew_R> zeromodulus: try adding .stop() before doing your mouseout animation
[16:21:58] <zeromodulus> Okay.
[16:22:35] <anew> what's the opposite of .remove() ? .attach() ?
[16:23:52] <jacoluta> gordian: there is no code yet. http://pastebin.com/hhdaQ0j5 but something like that. i have these functions
[16:24:07] <jacoluta> that i call immediately
[16:24:16] <jacoluta> but why would i call them if i dont need them
[16:24:38] <jacoluta> Am I making any sense? LOL
[16:25:09] <zeromodulus> Andrew_R: hmm, nope, didn't work. :P
[16:25:19] <zeromodulus> I actually had some stop() calls in there already.
[16:25:29] <zeromodulus> Before every animation I had a stop() in there.
[16:25:43] <Andrew_R> anew: insert(), insertAfter(), insertBefore(), append(), appendTo(), prepend(), prependTo(), there are a lot of options depending on where you want it to go
[16:25:53] <Andrew_R> zeromodulus: can you make a fiddle?
[16:25:57] <zeromodulus> Sure.
[16:26:45] <Xeus_> alguien ha usado library showloading?
[16:27:01] <Xeus_> has anyone used showloading library
[16:27:03] <Xeus_> ?
[16:27:16] <anew> insert sounds good thx lol
[16:29:36] <Xeus_> i have a image loading when i do post, but the image leave of show before finish of load, help me please
[16:31:25] <crawln> anyone use datatables
[16:35:57] <Xeus_> someone help me ?
[16:38:45] <zeromodulus> Hmm... okay...
[16:38:59] <zeromodulus> So I have a jsfiddle of the code I'm working on.
[16:39:06] <zeromodulus> But it doesn't work like the code I have. :P
[16:39:07] <zeromodulus> http://jsfiddle.net/j363t/
[16:39:14] <zeromodulus> It kind of does.
[16:41:09] <zeromodulus> Oooh, looks like I forgot to include jQuery UI.
[16:41:26] <zeromodulus> http://jsfiddle.net/j363t/3/
[16:41:40] <zeromodulus> Okay, so now it's working.
[16:41:57] <zeromodulus> Now if you mouseout in the middle of the animation...
[16:42:01] <zeromodulus> and then mouseover again...
[16:42:06] <zeromodulus> you should see the bug.
[16:42:34] <bsegovia> @zeromodulus: that's pretty sweet so far man
[16:42:42] <zeromodulus> thanks.
[16:42:46] <zeromodulus> It looks even sexier in production. :D
[16:43:10] <zeromodulus> You just can't interrupt the animation, or else it bugs out. :P
[16:43:13] <crawln> i'm trying to figure out why datatables isn't displaying a row that has a unicode char
[16:44:33] <crawln> WALL·E doesn't even display lol
[16:44:35] <crawln> wierd
[16:44:54] <crawln> works in the database and php
[16:48:35] <crawln> anyone have any thoughts on this/
[16:50:16] <beasty> hi guys
[16:50:31] <beasty> i see that .live() is deprecated in the new version of jquery
[16:50:42] <beasty> so i trie to replace them with .on()
[16:50:46] <beasty> but that doesn't seem to work
[16:50:49] <beasty> any ideas ?
[16:51:01] <myndzi> you want it to trigger on elements that get added after you bind the event yeah?
[16:51:08] <beasty> yes
[16:51:14] <myndzi> $(parent).on(event, child-selector, fn);
[16:51:35] <beasty> hmm ok
[16:51:40] <beasty> thanks i'll give it a try
[16:51:46] <myndzi> what that does is catch events on an element above
[16:51:49] <myndzi> which is probably how live worked anyway
[16:51:55] <myndzi> but it only triggers if they match the child selector
[16:52:16] <myndzi> if you leave out child-selector, then it binds directly to parent
[16:52:44] <beasty> i have stuff like .hide_row and .delete_row
[16:57:15] <Zitter> hi, is there a way (using drag&drop API) to know if a file has uploaded from another webpage or from desktop?
[16:58:53] <Zitter> on 'drop' event I have: files = $(e.oroginalEvent.dataTrasfer.getData('text/html')).filter('img').attr('src'); can I use that to know if it is from web (when typeof files !=='undefined') or from desktop?
[16:59:29] <bsegovia> I have a function that checks the value of an input on keyup. Within that function, it runs a mask based on the initial input. The problem I'm having is that when the keyup condition is found true, it completely overwrites the existing input when applying the proper mask. I think I need to capture the current value of the field and append it to the freshly cleared input box. if (initDig === "52") {
[16:59:30] <bsegovia>         // if initDig === 52 then use mask(mexico);
[16:59:30] <bsegovia>         $(this).mask(mexico).val(j); // trying to add current val to (this).val() so it doesn't overwrite... ugh.
[16:59:35] <bsegovia> oops.
[16:59:51] <bsegovia> http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/z63Zm/
[17:00:15] <bsegovia> I'm literally day 10 of learning jquery so please forgive my noobishness
[17:02:42] <bsegovia> does my question make sense?
[17:03:16] <jacoluta> http://pastebin.com/BJWEkaWB -- line 12 executes before the .each is finished. does anyone know how to fix this?
[17:04:28] <myndzi> bsegovia: it seems to work fine when you keep typing
[17:04:39] <myndzi> perhaps you just need to initialize your data
[17:05:19] <myndzi> jacoluta: you sure it's not the delay that's making the stuff from each happen later?
[17:05:43] <jacoluta> its not later. it is simultaneously
[17:06:12] <myndzi> well you said line 12 executes "before" the contents of each
[17:06:16] <myndzi> which means the contents of each execute later...?
[17:06:38] <bsegovia> @myndzi : try starting it with "52" which is my real world test. It should auto format to the "mexico" mask. instead it removes the first value, adds a space and then works *almost* as expected.
[17:07:24] <bsegovia> @myndzi : thanks for looking! =)
[17:09:11] <jacoluta> myndzi: i meant at the same time
[17:09:51] <myndzi> where's .mask c ome from?
[17:10:00] <myndzi> jacoluta: set a timer?
[17:10:37] <jacoluta> in that case it is a static length. but that won't solve the solution if its not. I guess i will have to do that for now
[17:10:56] <myndzi> calculate the duration based on each
[17:11:04] <myndzi> set a variable outside of it, increase it each time you loop
[17:11:05] <bsegovia> @myndzi: its a plugin http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[17:11:25] <myndzi> ahh i've never loaded external stuff in jsfiddle
[17:11:27] <myndzi> didn't know where to look
[17:11:58] <bsegovia> @myndzi : oh! on the left panel under "External Resources" you can paste in .js links.
[17:14:27] <myndzi> it seems like the instructions ask for you to call .mask only once
[17:14:29] <myndzi> not on an event
[17:14:30] <myndzi> it sets itself up
[17:14:58] <myndzi> so you're trying to detect the format and change it live
[17:15:04] <myndzi> but when you set it up it clears automatically
[17:15:16] <myndzi> you could use $.trigger perhaps to send a keypress event
[17:15:24] <myndzi> you just have to make sure you don't keep calling .mask repeatedly
[17:15:29] <myndzi> one sec
[17:15:34] <bsegovia> @myndzi exactly. I'd like to make a phone input field that is smart enough to detect what country formatting is required
[17:21:47] <myndzi> you might have to edit the plugin
[17:21:51] <myndzi> i have something that's close but not quite
[17:21:58] <myndzi> and it'd be silly to start messing with cursor position
[17:22:09] <myndzi> see: http://jsfiddle.net/z63Zm/9/
[17:23:26] <bsegovia> @myndzi ooh. lemme figure out what you did for a sec
[17:24:03] <myndzi> http://jsfiddle.net/z63Zm/10/
[17:24:03] <myndzi> there you go
[17:25:23] <bsegovia> this is almost perfect! Who ARE you???
[17:25:26] <bsegovia> lol
[17:25:53] <beasty> he's our new bot
[17:25:58] <beasty> with an improved AI
[17:26:31] <bsegovia> @myndzi: now i just need to figure out how to get it to allow for a "correction" so someone can switch from mask 1 to mask 2 without reloading
[17:26:42] <bsegovia> @myndzi THANK YOU
[17:26:56] <myndzi> :)
[17:27:26] <beasty> you have a fan brah!
[17:27:27] <myndzi> if you wanna be real nice
[17:27:27] <beasty> n1
[17:27:31] <myndzi> you can patch the plugin
[17:27:38] <myndzi> to allow this sort of thing
[17:27:42] <myndzi> that'd be a cleaner solution
[17:28:05] <bsegovia> @myndzi you're using so many methods I've never heard of yet. (Day 10 of learning jquery) I'm not even close to being qualified to patch a plugin. lol
[17:28:10] <myndzi> maybe i'll do it for something to do
[17:28:19] <bsegovia> WHAT
[17:28:39] <bsegovia> I can't learn this stuff fast enough
[17:28:44] <bsegovia> a bunch of gods running around in here
[17:28:47] <myndzi> there's plenty to learn hehe
[17:29:56] <bsegovia> so the double == is preferable to the trip ===?
[17:30:21] <bsegovia> double is format agnostic right? string/integer/etc?
[17:30:21] <myndzi> the reverse, usually
[17:30:33] <myndzi> but i use == when i haven't considered the implications
[17:30:38] <myndzi> yeah
[17:30:41] <bsegovia> gotcha. wider net
[17:30:43] <myndzi> "1" == 1
[17:30:47] <tw2113> triple is more strict in what returns true
[17:30:51] <bsegovia> i see
[17:30:59] <myndzi> null == undefined
[17:31:04] <tw2113> i wanna say equality as well as type
[17:31:05] <myndzi> null !== undefined
[17:31:10] <myndzi> there are some weird cases like that
[17:31:13] <myndzi> yes, equality and type
[17:31:22] <myndzi> == tries to cast them to match
[17:31:44] <bsegovia> awesome
[17:32:02] <tw2113> i wonder if false === 0 returns true
[17:32:07] <tw2113> ?eval false === 0
[17:32:11] <bot-t> tw2113: false
[17:32:19] <tw2113> ?eval false === false
[17:32:20] <bot-t> tw2113: true
[17:32:20] <bsegovia> i didn't' know you could divorce if, else if logic from curly brackets like you do in your jsfiddle
[17:32:29] <myndzi> oh, that's a bad habit
[17:32:36] <bsegovia> if (initDig ==  "52") mask = mexico;
[17:32:37] <myndzi> from mirc scripting :P
[17:32:44] <myndzi> but i find it more compact in some cases
[17:32:50] <bsegovia> well it takes
[17:32:54] <myndzi> (mirc scripting didn't used to have curly braces....)
[17:32:58] <tw2113> i like ternary
[17:32:58] <myndzi> i hope i didn't just date myself lol
[17:32:59] <tw2113> :D
[17:33:19] <bsegovia> that's good to know. I was told to code exactly the minimum you  need to so.. if it works!
[17:33:30] <myndzi> well
[17:33:33] <myndzi> linters will complain about that sort of thing
[17:33:40] <myndzi> and especially if you're new they can lead to confusing bugs
[17:33:42] <bsegovia> lol linters?
[17:33:43] <myndzi> so i don't recommend doing it
[17:33:52] <myndzi> programs that check your stuff for bad form / errors
[17:33:55] <bsegovia> oh
[17:33:57] <tw2113> linters, things that run your js through a belly button
[17:34:04] <bsegovia> hahahaha
[17:34:04] <myndzi> jshint.com for example
[17:34:24] <myndzi> if you don't have a firm grasp on flow control then you might be tempted to do something like
[17:34:32] <myndzi> if (condition) var1 = 'foo'; var2 = 'bar';
[17:34:39] <bsegovia> right right
[17:34:41] <myndzi> and then later on you get some really weird bug that you can't figure out
[17:34:50] <myndzi> because var2 = 'bar' runs every time
[17:35:02] <bsegovia> I'm trying to figure out these lines. I'm all "declaring functions and defining vars at the same time!??!?!"
[17:35:07] <tw2113> sans bracket if statements are best for 1 line execution
[17:35:19] <bsegovia> "where is my god now!"
[17:35:19] <tw2113> if there's more than 1 line, best to bracket it
[17:35:29] <myndzi> if there's more than one line you HAVE to :P
[17:35:37] <myndzi> i think my general rule of thumb is
[17:35:44] <myndzi> i use brackets if there are elseifs or elses involved
[17:35:51] <myndzi> unless it's a pseudo-switch setup like i did here
[17:36:03] <myndzi> i often do something like
[17:36:08] <myndzi> if (condition) return;
[17:37:08] <myndzi> you might find benefit from literal object declaration in this project ;)
[17:37:48] <myndzi> var masks = { "1": "+1 (999) 999-9999", "33": "+33 9 99 99 99 99", etc... };
[17:37:52] <myndzi> then you can check
[17:38:02] <myndzi> if (initDig in masks) { use mask masks[initDig]; }
[17:38:15] <myndzi> else { no match }
[17:38:26] <bsegovia> good call
[17:40:13] <bsegovia> i really thought i had this thing under control until i talked to you.
[17:40:17] <zeromodulus> crap... so... I tried a couple stopPropagation calls...
[17:40:31] <zeromodulus> and I tried chaining the event handler definitions...
[17:40:37] <zeromodulus> but I still get the bug.
[17:42:38] <zeromodulus> I cleaned up the code a little bit too: http://jsfiddle.net/j363t/6/
[17:42:46] <myndzi> ahh
[17:42:47] <myndzi> i think i see
[17:43:23] <myndzi> eh don't sweat it
[17:43:24] <zeromodulus> I'm thinking, if I make it so that the mouseleave event doesn't fire off until mouseenter has finished... the bug won't happen.
[17:43:34] <myndzi> i only mentioned it because it could save you some trouble, especially if you're looking to make a big list
[17:43:40] <zeromodulus> So, is there a way that I can pause all events?
[17:43:43] <myndzi> you could even store it in some file and serve it up as json on request
[17:43:56] <bsegovia> lol
[17:44:08] <bsegovia> you're opening doors to worlds of things I didn't know I didn't know
[17:44:17] <bsegovia> THANK YOU
[17:44:45] <zeromodulus> I know that .stop() will make it so that all currently running animations will stop...
[17:44:59] <zeromodulus> But...
[17:45:17] <zeromodulus> It only works once.
[17:45:22] <zeromodulus> Er...
[17:45:27] <zeromodulus> It doesn't keep them stopped.
[17:45:40] <zeromodulus> I want to keep all animations stopped, until I say they can start again. :P
[17:47:42] <gnarf> zeromodulus: you can set jQuery.fx.off
[17:48:04] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.fx.off/
[17:48:20] <gnarf> however
[17:48:25] <gnarf> this actually does something a little different
[17:48:32] <gnarf> because it sets all animation durations to 0
[17:48:36] <gnarf> so everything jumps to final points
[17:49:09] <gnarf> but in the sort of case you're looking for, you'll need to set some other variable in a scope you can use to stop yourself from requesting animations
[17:49:15] <gnarf> the other thing you can do is
[17:49:25] <gnarf> .queue(function( next ) { // store next somewhere })
[17:49:47] <gnarf> so that it can't start another animation in the queue until you call next()
[17:51:22] <gnarf> basically, no matter what, what you want isn't "easy" :)
[17:51:23] <bsegovia> @myndzi: How can I restart the process if I tab out and in to the field?
[17:53:01] <gnarf> oh i guess he didn't need help
[17:53:36] <bsegovia> @gnarf lol
[17:53:52] <bsegovia> [ragequit]
[17:54:50] <gnarf> that particular animation problem is an old one
[17:54:56] <gnarf> it's just hard to do
[17:55:29] <gnarf> especially since his "animation" was really like 2 animations
[17:55:36] <gnarf> you have to track a lot of state
[17:59:59] <myndzi> oh haha
[18:00:05] <myndzi> my 'fix' got in the way of my fix
[18:02:03] <bsegovia> myndzi: ?
[18:02:11] <tw2113> http://codepen.io/cwolves/pen/gykbc
[18:02:18] <myndzi> i was wondering why when i debugged it it seemed to work and then it cleared out the +1
[18:02:26] <myndzi> it's because of the .val after the .mask
[18:02:40] <bsegovia> oh
[18:02:47] <myndzi> so i got it to keep the numbers easily
[18:02:49] <bsegovia> @tw2113
[18:02:51] <bsegovia> whoa
[18:02:53] <myndzi> now i just need to work out how it sets the cursor position
[18:03:47] <myndzi> bam!
[18:03:53] <bsegovia> haha
[18:04:12] * myndzi forks
[18:05:42] <bsegovia> http://jsfiddle.net/z63Zm/13/ ?
[18:06:56] <bsegovia> i don't even recognize this thing anymore. "iPhone = /iphone/i.test(ua)," ??? hahah what have you done!
[18:06:59] <myndzi> not quite
[18:07:00] <myndzi> no
[18:07:05] <myndzi> i just took the jquery plugin and pasted it in
[18:07:09] <myndzi> so i could debug/trace/edit
[18:07:09] <bsegovia> oh
[18:07:12] <bsegovia> wow ok
[18:07:21] <myndzi> turned out to be a simple 1 line change
[18:07:24] <myndzi> just had to understand what was going on
[18:07:25] <myndzi> https://github.com/myndzi/jquery.maskedinput
[18:07:33] <myndzi> you can get the js from there until / if he accepts my pull request
[18:08:20] <tw2113> this codepen is fun
[18:10:10] <bsegovia> myndzi: you're incredible. You improved his plugin. Ok, going to  re-add it as an external js and give it a run
[18:13:36] <myndzi> bsegovia: one sec
[18:13:41] <myndzi> don't take off just yet :)
[18:13:55] <myndzi> btw it looks like that was a bug
[18:14:03] <myndzi> the plugin seems already set up to do that, it just didn't get called properly
[18:14:24] <bsegovia> ok I'm here for sure
[18:17:09] <myndzi> http://jsfiddle.net/z63Zm/16/
[18:17:10] <myndzi> there you go
[18:17:24] <myndzi> don't source it from my github of course, but that serves to demonstrate
[18:17:42] <myndzi> you can delete digits and type a new one now too
[18:17:54] <myndzi> and in general cleaned it up as much as i could
[18:18:02] <myndzi> should be obvious/easy how to add new masks
[18:18:04] <myndzi> etc. :)
[18:19:55] <myndzi> one gotcha: if there are any codes like "11" you'll need to do some extra work
[18:20:01] <myndzi> but i don't know that that's the case, or think that it is
[18:20:37] <bsegovia> myndzi: I have been trying to achieve this for over 5 days now. I have been on a sleep deprived learning fest (all good things) trying to get this to work and you rocked it
[18:21:35] <myndzi> i know how that can be
[18:21:38] <myndzi> glad i could help
[18:22:20] <killrector> tampermonkey assistance?
[18:26:41] <zeromodulus> Wooooo!
[18:26:43] <zeromodulus> I did it!
[18:26:44] <zeromodulus> :D
[18:27:00] <bsegovia> @zeromodulus ^5
[18:27:09] <zeromodulus> \o
[18:27:32] <zeromodulus> I'll update the fiddle in case anyone's curious. :P
[18:29:36] <myndzi> ah man, sorry; i saw you asking but i didn't think i'd be occupied so long. glad you got it :)
[18:30:13] <zeromodulus> s'ok. :P
[18:31:06] <zeromodulus> Hmm... weird... I must have changed some other things, because the fiddle doesn't work even with the fix. :P
[18:31:55] <js_doode> Andrew_R: you helped me earlier but I'm still having trouble. let me explain...
[18:32:19] <myndzi> what are you trying to do?
[18:32:25] <myndzi> i didn't catch the actual goal
[18:32:33] <js_doode> Andrew_R: jquery, what I have so far. http://jsfiddle.net/DCnn5/4/
[18:32:56] <js_doode> Andrew_R: this is how I want the styled links to act in jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/pXndy/
[18:33:04] <myndzi> eh, now it w orks
[18:33:18] <myndzi> such simple code, dunno why it was wonky before
[18:33:43] <zeromodulus> Hmm... it's still not completely bug free. :/
[18:33:50] <myndzi> there we go, i managed to reproduce
[18:33:59] <myndzi> seems like a timing thing
[18:33:59] <zeromodulus> Better, but not perfect. :P
[18:34:08] <myndzi> this is actually the sort of thing that gsap would be perfect for
[18:34:31] <myndzi> use timeline lite and create a timeline of your effects then just run it back and forth
[18:34:32] <myndzi> http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/
[18:34:52] <myndzi> but because i now how annoying it is to be offered a different method rather than the solution.. :P
[18:34:59] <myndzi> let's see if i can figure this out
[18:35:34] <js_doode> can anyone please take a look at both my jsfiddle links above and see
[18:35:46] <js_doode> what I'm doing wrong in my jquery. I'm a beginner. thanks
[18:35:56] <zeromodulus> so, if you call .stop() on an element, will that stop all animations on that element, as well as all of the animations on that element's children?
[18:36:23] <myndzi> i'd think just the element(?)
[18:36:36] <myndzi> js_doode: any reason you don't just use css :hover selector?
[18:37:15] <js_doode> myndzi: true. but I'm learning javascript/jquery that's why :)
[18:37:24] <zeromodulus> hrm...
[18:37:49] <myndzi> js_doode: you need to set both properties in both callbacks
[18:37:52] <myndzi> otherwise one will just stay
[18:38:12] <myndzi> zeromodulus: i think i see what's happening
[18:38:15] <zeromodulus> Okay, I'll assume I'll have to stop the children as well.
[18:38:17] <myndzi> when you interrupt the sequence
[18:38:23] <js_doode> myndzi: thank you for answering. I'm a newbie don't know what callbacks are
[18:38:25] <myndzi> it stops it where it's at
[18:38:34] <zeromodulus> ah, yeah.
[18:38:36] <myndzi> js_doode: callbacks are the functions that get called; in this case, the parameters to hover
[18:38:47] <myndzi> zeromodulus: so you can actually "move" it over by interrupting it at the wrong time etc.
[18:38:54] <zeromodulus> ah, yeah.
[18:38:54] <myndzi> try resetting its position when stopping
[18:39:04] <zeromodulus> how might I do that?
[18:39:15] <myndzi> absolute positioning?
[18:39:23] <myndzi> the text, for example
[18:39:30] <myndzi> you could tween it between left: 0% and left: 100%
[18:39:41] <zeromodulus> x.x
[18:39:47] <myndzi> place it inside the container and make sure the container is position: relative or something
[18:39:55] <myndzi> then if you need to reset it, just set it directly to 100%
[18:40:30] <myndzi> hmmm
[18:40:36] <myndzi> you might be able to do this with css transitions :V
[18:40:46] <zeromodulus> what if I somehow force it to do the reverse animation?
[18:40:52] <zeromodulus> :P
[18:41:03] <myndzi> well if you always have a destination in mind
[18:41:08] <myndzi> you can always either animate it "from wherever i am to there"
[18:41:12] <myndzi> or go directly there
[18:41:21] <myndzi> i definitely recommend checking out timelinelite though
[18:41:29] <myndzi> this is the exact sort of thing it's built for
[18:42:10] <zeromodulus> ah, I think I see what you mean.
[18:43:58] <zeromodulus> hmm...
[18:43:59] <zeromodulus> but
[18:44:08] <zeromodulus> unless I'm using an explicit size in pixels...
[18:44:25] <zeromodulus> then it should use like, relative positioning with show() and hide(), right?
[18:45:42] <myndzi> you're gonna either hate or love me
[18:45:48] <myndzi> http://jsfiddle.net/j363t/8/
[18:45:51] <zeromodulus> yeah, I'm seeing position: relative show up in the web inspector
[18:46:15] <zeromodulus> :o
[18:46:22] <zeromodulus> !
[18:46:31] <myndzi> you need to use some browser prefix bs to get the major browsers
[18:46:49] <myndzi> http://caniuse.com/css-transitions
[18:46:54] <myndzi> and you also say "screw ie"
[18:46:54] <myndzi> ;)
[18:46:58] <myndzi> but the cool thing is
[18:47:01] <myndzi> even if they don't support transitions
[18:47:09] <myndzi> as long as they support hover, it will still at least toggle back and forth
[18:48:20] <zeromodulus> sweet, that is perfect.
[18:48:22] <zeromodulus> thanks.
[18:48:27] <myndzi> \o/
[18:50:01] <js_doode> myndzi: pardon the ignorance. still having trouble
[18:50:09] <js_doode> myndzi: is there an example I can see?
[18:52:22] <myndzi> what's your current code?
[18:56:06] <js_doode> myndzi: http://jsfiddle.net/DCnn5/4/
[18:56:27] <myndzi> and what you want is to ..?
[18:56:36] <zeromodulus> aw crap.
[18:56:39] <myndzi> mousevoer a link, changes to one color and underlined
[18:56:43] <zeromodulus> so, now...
[18:56:45] <myndzi> mouseout it goes to another and not underlined?
[18:57:01] <zeromodulus> I'm trying to do display:none; for the default state of the text.
[18:57:09] <zeromodulus> because in my live code... you can see it hanging off to the right.
[18:57:10] <myndzi> do visibility: hidden;
[18:57:14] <js_doode> myndzi: the links stay green and underlined
[18:57:15] <zeromodulus> ah, k
[18:57:18] <myndzi> but no
[18:57:23] <myndzi> don't do that
[18:57:23] <js_doode> myndzi: want them to go back to original state.
[18:57:26] <myndzi> use overflow: hidden on the parent
[18:57:32] <myndzi> then you don't have to mess with visibility at all
[18:57:53] <myndzi> js_doode: stay green and underlined, and also go back?
[18:57:58] <myndzi> i'm a little confused :P
[18:58:20] <myndzi> you want them to stay green
[18:58:20] <zeromodulus> aw dang
[18:58:21] <zeromodulus> :P
[18:58:23] <myndzi> but make the underline go away?
[18:58:24] <zeromodulus> ah, okay
[18:58:24] <js_doode> myndzi: sorry. http://jsfiddle.net/pXndy/ like the css example
[18:58:37] <js_doode> myndzi: except I don't want to use css.
[18:58:44] <myndzi> right
[18:58:48] <myndzi> so, red, no underline
[18:58:52] <myndzi> and green, underlined
[18:58:55] <myndzi> change back and forth, yes?
[18:58:57] <js_doode> myndzi: yes
[18:59:03] <js_doode> myndzi: yes
[18:59:06] <myndzi> .hover takes two arguments; one for mousein and one for mouseout
[18:59:13] <myndzi> the first one gets called when your mouse goes over the element
[18:59:18] <zeromodulus> perfect!
[18:59:18] <myndzi> the second one gets called when your mouse leaves the element
[18:59:19] <zeromodulus> thank you!
[18:59:31] <myndzi> so when the mouse enters, you're only setting the color (not underline status)
[18:59:39] <myndzi> and when the mouse leaves, you're only setting the underline status (not color)
[19:00:29] <myndzi> i'm also not entirely certain why the 'do not style' links aren't triggering it
[19:00:46] <js_doode> myndzi: no i don't want to style those
[19:00:55] <myndzi> i know
[19:00:57] <js_doode> myndzi: ignore those
[19:00:58] <myndzi> also nevermind
[19:01:02] <myndzi> i thought they were wrapped in a <p>
[19:01:13] <myndzi> so okay. when the mouse enters you want it to be GREEN and UNDERLINED yes?
[19:01:19] <myndzi> but your function is only making it green
[19:01:25] <myndzi> presumably you can figure out what to do?
[19:01:40] <js_doode> myndzi: yes when mouse over green and underlined
[19:01:51] <myndzi> but your code isn't underlining it
[19:01:52] <myndzi> why?
[19:01:55] <gnarf> why not just use p:hover { color: green; text-decoration: underline; }
[19:01:56] <gnarf> ?
[19:02:03] <myndzi> he's using this as a tool to learn jquery
[19:02:18] <gnarf> using jQuery to maniuplate css is like devil's work tho
[19:02:24] <js_doode> gnarf: yes learning jqueryr
[19:02:34] <myndzi> it's a visible indicator that the code is doing something :P
[19:02:34] <gnarf> presentation in css, code in js, structure in html
[19:02:35] * myndzi shrugs
[19:02:41] <gnarf> so is console.log ?
[19:02:42] <js_doode> gnarf: i get it
[19:02:59] <myndzi> console is rather less visual don't you think?
[19:03:09] <myndzi> anyway, js_doode: i'm asking you questions
[19:03:09] <gnarf> well
[19:03:14] <gnarf> use .addClass() either way
[19:03:15] <myndzi> try and answer them or at least say you don't know :P
[19:03:16] <track7> I need helP!!!!!
[19:03:19] <gnarf> that makes more sense ;)
[19:03:23] <track7> HELP ME =[
[19:03:27] <js_doode> myndzi: i don't know
[19:03:28] <gnarf> `ask
[19:03:28] <b-ot> gnarf: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[19:03:31] <myndzi> i'm trying to answer the meaning of his question first
[19:03:32] <gnarf> track7: ^
[19:03:33] <myndzi> heh
[19:03:42] <track7> Im trying to write JS to store in SQL
[19:03:58] <myndzi> js_doode: lemme query you so we don't spam up the channel more
[19:04:08] <js_doode> myndzi: ok
[19:04:44] <gnarf> track7: what have you tried already, have you googled, can you describe the problem a bit more?   JS doesn't generally talk to SQL directly
[19:06:01] <track7> http://pastebin.com/ethm6Wpu
[19:06:09] <track7> http://imgur.com/tBdqqgI
[19:06:16] <track7> ^ is what that code above does
[19:06:29] <track7> Im trying to store the printed line in a SQL DB
[19:06:56] <gnarf> so you have to ajax it to your sever through some endpoint yeah?
[19:07:18] <gnarf> your server needs a script on the server side that takes a "new track" event to append to the log
[19:07:31] <track7> Says Track Changed to: Thriller by Michael Jackson
[19:07:38] <track7> I want to store that line in a DB
[19:07:43] <gnarf> so you have to ajax it to your sever through some endpoint yeah?
[19:07:44] <gnarf> your server needs a script on the server side that takes a "new track" event to append to the log
[19:08:02] <gnarf> then you can call that from an ajax request in the javascript
[19:08:09] <track7> ya what you said
[19:08:19] <track7> However, I don't know how to cross script that way
[19:08:46] <track7> No way to store in a flat file?
[19:09:02] <gnarf> you need server side code to get into your sql server
[19:09:11] <gnarf> there is just no way around that
[19:09:37] <jackw411> i have this json return: http://pastebin.com/xXxT8cWQ - trying to loop through and grab each photoset.ID and store it in an object... but for some reason as i loop through i cannot get at them.. how would you grab them all? currently doing something like : $.each(data, function(i, item){
[19:09:37] <jackw411>                 console.log(item);
[19:09:37] <jackw411>                 PSIDS = item.photoset.id;
[19:09:37] <jackw411>           });      } isn't working
[19:10:05] <zeromodulus> myndzi: what if I want to remove all of the effects from the first p tag? couldn't I do like, #text:first { transition: none;} or something?
[19:10:12] <gnarf> so an AJAX call is basically like browsing to a webpage, something like $.ajax("/api/nowplaying.php", { data: { track_id: ...., etc: ... }, type: "POST" })
[19:10:13] <myndzi> :first-child
[19:10:20] <gnarf> `jQuery.ajax @track7
[19:10:24] <myndzi> but it's better to use classes if you can
[19:10:43] <gnarf> `api jQuery.ajax @track7
[19:10:43] <b-ot> track7: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[19:10:45] <zeromodulus> hmm... I think I might have to addclass with jquery.
[19:10:57] <zeromodulus> because this particular text comes from a rich text editor.
[19:11:20] <track7> I am trying to figure out how
[19:11:24] <track7> thats all I would need
[19:11:35] <track7> I can then do all the reporting and db stuff
[19:11:36] <myndzi> what are you trying to do in more detail?
[19:11:41] <gnarf> zeromodulus: your animation question earlier, thats gonna be one of the hardest things you'll ever do.. trust me, I'm the one who wrote all the code that makes sure that .toggle( 1000 ) then later .stop() and .toggle() goes back the other way, its a true pain in the ass...
[19:12:09] <jackw411> anybody help a brother out?
[19:12:10] <jackw411> :<
[19:13:10] <gnarf> track7: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_GIBLNmtco might help you out a bit
[19:13:28] <gnarf> talks about using PHP and jQuery ajax to make a comment field
[19:13:53] <gnarf> there are a bunch of linked videos there
[19:13:54] <gnarf> etc
[19:14:01] <track7> So would i create a server side PHP script?
[19:14:14] <gnarf> but anyway, this is all googlable - I've given you the all keywords you need
[19:14:15] <track7> I am trying to figure out how it would communicate with the Spotify APP
[19:14:26] <gnarf> it doesn't?
[19:14:35] <gnarf> spotify is pretty much a sandbox
[19:14:39] <track7> the spotify app is HTML/CSS and JS
[19:14:49] <gnarf> yeah, in an app - its a sandbox
[19:15:00] <gnarf> not much communication in or out from it
[19:15:01] <gnarf> but
[19:15:02] <gnarf> like
[19:15:40] <track7> thats where I am stuck
[19:15:49] <track7> In the app for tools
[19:15:54] <track7> it shows you can use SQL
[19:15:56] <gnarf> you're asking how to do something a senior developer would scratch his head about
[19:16:05] <gnarf> at least w/r/t spotify
[19:16:51] <gnarf> easy stuff first, learn what ajax is, how to use it well with jQuery and whatever server side language you're using, etc - there are lots of tutorials on google
[19:17:40] <track7> Hmm, is anyone able familiar with a fast way to store/log that track change and info
[19:18:05] <track7> <div class="playhistory"><h2>Play History</h2>
[19:18:05] <track7> 				<div id="play-history"></div>
[19:18:05] <track7> 			</div>
[19:18:11] <track7> thats the line in the HTML file
[19:18:13] <gnarf> jackw411: $.each(data.photoset, function( index, photoset ) { console.log( id ) ; } ); ?
[19:21:27] <killrector> '$' was used before it was defined
[19:21:31] <killrector> anyone?
[19:21:51] <gnarf> killrector: never seen that error
[19:22:17] <killrector> trying to add a script to tampermonkey in chrome and it's giving me a syntax error and won't execute the script
[19:22:39] * tw2113 just heard Douglas Crockford say to never use double equal to check for equality, always use triple
[19:23:21] <killrector> http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/114079
[19:23:26] <killrector> here's the script if you want to look at it
[19:26:15] <jackw411> gnarf: ty
[19:26:35] <track7> Can anyone help me write this??
[19:26:40] <track7> I will pay $200
[19:26:52] <track7> This one function
[19:27:01] <track7> using multiple functions?
[19:27:23] <gnarf> killrector: eh, the environment i can't reproduce, but i bet you it has something to do with cross-window security issues, or perhaps, just not having loaded jQuery in the right environment
[19:27:55] <killrector> gnarf: I'm trying to do it on chrome/win7 if you think it matters
[19:28:18] <gnarf> killrector: i know that greasemonkey had all sorts of weird timing shit you had to do if you wanted to load scripts
[19:28:33] <killrector> I was thinking along those lines, I'll probably try it in firefox
[19:28:44] <gnarf> killrector: but like, I'm not much in the mood for diving into debugging super deep atm
[19:28:57] <killrector> roger that
[19:29:15] <killrector> appreciate it though, first time doing anything in js/jquery
[19:30:27] <gnarf> those *monkey environments are trickier than cross-domain iframes :)
[19:30:34] <gnarf> `glwt
[19:30:34] <b-ot> gnarf: http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
[19:30:36] <killrector> hehe
[19:32:29] <jackw411> guys say i have a set of values that I want to store in a variable so i can iterate through - what is the best way of storing them? js has crappy array support correct?
[19:33:25] <huangfeng> guys, I tried to grab the code on my local but doesn't work, I don't know about SCSS, anyone can help me make it work? thank you. http://css-tricks.com/slide-in-as-you-scroll-down-boxes/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter
[19:34:07] <gnarf> jackw411: define crappy, arrays are still arrays
[19:34:24] <jackw411> yeah but they are quite slow in js?
[19:34:32] <gnarf> jackw411: not really
[19:34:50] <gnarf> at least not in comparison to whatever else you might dream up
[19:34:52] <track7> Im going to eat beans and bread and will be back - to trip out more
[19:34:56] <jackw411> think I got that from a crockford lecture
[19:35:18] <gnarf> jackw411: how long ago was that recorded?
[19:35:45] <gnarf> because modern JS interpreters are pretty damn fast in comparison to even 5 years ago
[19:36:07] <gnarf> but anyway, if its numerically indexed from 0 -> whatever, arrays are your best bet
[19:36:27] <gnarf> but your slices and splices are a little expensive, etc... i mean, what order of magnitude are you talking?
[19:37:23] <jackw411> i think about 100 different 10 digit strings used as identifiers... shouldn't be a problem do you think?
[19:37:35] <gnarf> no way
[19:37:37] <gnarf> thats tiny
[19:37:48] <gnarf> if you were talking thousands maybe a problem
[19:37:57] <gnarf> so
[19:37:58] <gnarf> also
[19:38:03] <gnarf> if you don't need the "index"
[19:38:09] <gnarf> you could just store them as keys on object
[19:38:13] <gnarf> like a dictionary
[19:38:22] <codepython777> does anyone know of a decent looking file manager on html/css/js? (preferably using jquery) and backend python.
[19:38:23] <gnarf> and use "thisidstr" in dict
[19:38:35] <codepython777> something like this: http://extplorer.sourceforge.net/ - but no php
[19:39:16] <jackw411> gnarf: cool, i'll look into that
[19:44:15] <jackw411> gnarf: do you know anything about backbone.js just out of interest?
[19:45:46] <zeromodulus> gnarf: well, I did get it working with the help of myndzi, using CSS3 transitions.
[19:46:10] <Gmac_> i am using a lpugin which creates an editor form using jquery and the form is in an iframe
[19:46:14] <Gmac_> which means i can't type it
[19:46:21] <Gmac_> how can i figure out where this iframe is
[19:46:26] <Gmac_> and find how to style it
[19:49:08] <gnarf> zeromodulus: yeah, i was gonna suggest that
[19:49:20] <gnarf> zeromodulus: css3 even has "dealy" :)
[19:49:26] <zeromodulus> :P
[19:50:56] <zeromodulus> well, I got it kind of working better.
[19:50:59] <zeromodulus> haha...
[19:51:07] <zeromodulus> but, there are some quirks. :/
[19:51:23] <zeromodulus> it just disappears on mouse out.
[19:51:27] <zeromodulus> instead of sliding back.
[19:52:34] <zeromodulus> I think I'll work on it some more tomorrow. :P
[19:54:02] <myndzi> code?
[19:54:09] <myndzi> css transitions are irritating
[19:54:40] <myndzi> ( zeromodulus )
[19:55:24] <zeromodulus> Well, it worked the way you suggested it, but, I wrote some code to only apply the effect to certain p tags.
[19:55:41] <myndzi> yeah, but if you show me i can perhaps identify what's missing ;)
[19:56:30] <zeromodulus> I did... var p_tags = $('#container p'); var p_tags_slide = p_tags.slice(1, p_tags.length); $(p_tags_slide).addClass('slide');
[19:56:47] <zeromodulus> Then I pretty much just changed the CSS selector to have p.slide for the text to be slid. :P
[19:56:59] <zeromodulus> Because I want the first p tag to be static.
[19:57:18] <myndzi> er, well i can't fit that in my head, but basically what you need to do is ensure that there's a transition property on each state
[19:57:22] <myndzi> so if it's disappearing instead of sliding out
[19:57:27] <myndzi> you need a transition on the "hidden" state
[19:57:28] <zeromodulus> ah...
[19:57:46] <zeromodulus> hmm...
[19:57:50] <zeromodulus> okay.
[19:58:35] <zeromodulus> Hmm, well, the web inspector shows that it is having the transition state applied.
[19:58:50] <zeromodulus> er
[19:59:01] <zeromodulus> The transition property is there for both states.
[19:59:23] <myndzi> then something else is affecting it
[19:59:25] <zeromodulus> Actually, I can't see the :hover state in the web inspector.
[19:59:30] <zeromodulus> So, I dunno.
[19:59:37] <myndzi> or yeah, a non-matching selector could do it
[19:59:38] <zeromodulus> But it is receiving the slide class.
[20:00:17] <zeromodulus> I'm pretty sure the :hover selector is working, because it is doing the transition on hover.
[20:00:48] <zeromodulus> and it does have the slide class, and it does have the transition property.
[20:01:15] <zeromodulus> myndzi: here's the full example: http://zm-theme-test.tumblr.com/
[20:01:41] <zeromodulus> myndzi: also, if you hover over the second photo, for some weird reason there are multiple paragraphs showing up.
[20:03:10] <myndzi> take off visibility: hidden
[20:03:25] <myndzi> that property doesn't have midway states, and it doesn't have a delay or transition applied anyway
[20:03:32] <myndzi> but you don't need it so it's waste
[20:03:32] <zeromodulus> Beautiful.
[20:03:40] <zeromodulus> Ah, right.
[20:03:46] <zeromodulus> It's no longer needed since there's overflow: hidden.
[20:03:49] <zeromodulus> :D
[20:04:13] <zeromodulus> Any thoughts on the second photo displaying multiple paragraphs?
[20:04:14] <zeromodulus> :P
[20:04:47] <myndzi> you have three ps
[20:04:50] <myndzi> underneath it
[20:04:54] <myndzi> so it's showing three ps
[20:05:07] <zeromodulus> x.x
[20:05:20] <zeromodulus> So perhaps I should wrap them in a container?
[20:05:25] <myndzi> indeed ;)
[20:05:25] <zeromodulus> And then apply the effect to the container?
[20:05:27] <zeromodulus> :D
[20:05:43] <myndzi> nice looking effect in that implementation too
[20:06:53] <zeromodulus> Thanks. :D
[20:07:25] <myndzi> i might close it up faster, or double up the transitions
[20:08:19] <myndzi> disable the transition-delay on .photo and see what you think
[20:09:42] <zeromodulus> Hmm, yeah, not bad.
[20:11:15] <zeromodulus> Perfect!
[20:11:18] <zeromodulus> Thanks. :D

[23:03:07] <CorySimmons> Hi guys, I'm trying to make a race between 2 boxes from one side of the screen to the other. I've got the motions and some random speeds in there, but how do I intercept the whole thing IF one of the boxes touches the right side of the screen (aka: The Finish Line)? Here's where I'm at: http://jsfiddle.net/Px3Fh/
[23:36:28] <Gazpacho> hmm
[23:38:36] <Gazpacho> html doesn't do collision detection
[23:49:29] <enerel> i wnted to use this tab http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/tabview/demo.html but cannot see icons, i think it is bug, can enyone help me where the bug is

[23:55:18] <mfranz> Hi all, I have been struggling with this for about an hour on google, I want to create a collapsible-set dynamically from MySQL via PHP, I have the ajax call working correctly and it returns a string: <div data-role="collapsible" id="set1"><h3>2013-04-07 01:31:35 - Lap Colectomy - Total</h3></div>  I have then the OnSuccess of ajax do a $("#collapsible_set").append(data) ... the (data) is that
[23:55:18] <mfranz> string.  However the DOM does not update on the page to show this element, if I copy that string (Data) element into the dom manually it works correclty, any ideas?
[23:55:36] <mfranz> I am sure it is that the DOM is getting loaded before the ajax is completed somehow, but I am unsure how to fix that
[23:57:10] <sacho> show a test case of your code
