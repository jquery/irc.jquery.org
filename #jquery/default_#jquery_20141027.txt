[00:22:19] <tinkiete> hi to all
[01:42:11] <Mark__> whatâ€™s the opposite of toggleClass?
[01:44:45] <Erwat> staticClass ?
[01:45:06] * AdamPDotty wonders, whether there is a reat demand for keepClass()
[01:46:51] <Cork> Mark__: toggle is a two directional class modifier
[01:47:00] <Cork> there isn't an opposite
[01:50:15] <Silmarilion> Hi, can we use jqm icons for text inputs, or are they only for buttons?
[02:33:53] <Xatenev> Heya
[02:34:10] <Xatenev> what is wrong with this? $("#regionId-" + data.filterRegions[a]).prop("checked", true).addClass("selected");
[02:34:15] <Xatenev> data.FilterRegions is set
[02:34:18] <Xatenev> it should set the checkbox to true
[02:34:20] <Xatenev> and add the class selected
[02:34:26] <Xatenev> but it doesnt check it =(
[02:34:41] <Cork> Xatenev: most likely the selector doesn't match
[02:34:41] <Xatenev> But the class selected is appended to the element
[02:34:48] <Xatenev> It does - the class selected is appended
[02:35:04] <Xatenev> *UNHAPPY*^^
[02:35:07] <Cork> hmm
[02:35:12] <Cork> doesn't make sense
[02:35:18] <Xatenev> seems completly correct to me tho
[02:35:26] <Cork> are you sure selected is added by that line?
[02:35:47] <Xatenev> Oh i got an idea
[02:35:48] <Xatenev> sec
[02:36:02] <Xatenev> .parent() gives me the parent in the DOM or?
[02:36:45] <Xatenev> aah works great now..
[02:36:57] <Xatenev> the class selected had to be appended to the parent element to make the checkbox checked
[02:37:03] <Xatenev> so it wasnt a jquery problem^^
[02:38:59] <Xatenev> thanks anyways
[03:02:17] <larsemil> if an object has css margin: auto; can i get that width in px?
[03:02:54] <Cork> larsemil: yes outerWidth and outerHeight
[03:03:05] <Cork> minus the width/height of the element
[03:03:10] <Cork> divided by two
[03:06:15] <larsemil> Cork: SWEET!
[03:20:51] <redShadow> Cheers.. I have a seemingly strange behavior with caching of ajax requests.. https://bpaste.net/show/4593b1bc6333
[03:21:46] <redShadow> that is: apparently, only requests made *inside* jquery "onload" function are cached, and only if they are run "asynchronously" (wrapping in setTimeout(..., 0))
[03:23:05] <redShadow> but yesterday I tried with a server running locally, and even requests outside the jquery onload were cached, but still they had to be wrapped in setTimeout(..., 0)
[03:23:14] <redShadow> any explanation on this?
[03:23:51] <sacho_> what are the request and response headers
[03:26:24] <redShadow> sacho_: the response is setting a Cache-control: public, max-age=30
[03:26:48] <redShadow> (btw, on jsfiddle it always caches... even when putting the code directly in the <body>)
[03:27:43] <redShadow> sacho_: https://bpaste.net/show/edf8e69ec8dd
[03:29:17] <sacho_> that's just response headers, and only for one of them
[03:41:13] <redShadow> sacho_: mh?
[05:01:58] <tirengarfio> Im using parseHTML to convert a string to an object. After that I append it to the dom, the but the element is not shown, but its html code
[05:02:16] <tirengarfio> so how to show the element?
[05:03:29] <tirengarfio> console.log(parseHTML(string)) returns a TextNode object
[05:03:42] <tirengarfio> I expected just Object
[05:04:57] <tirengarfio> this is the code
[05:05:27] <decx> you're in #jquery so just do $(string)
[05:08:37] <tirengarfio> decx, what do you mean?
[05:08:51] <tirengarfio> https://gist.github.com/Ziiweb/0d7f963262aa52a673e6
[05:10:09] <curvv> can i use the ajax error: for throwing custom errors, or should i just include the error in the response and handle it in success: ?
[05:12:08] <Cork> curvv: error depends on the status code from the server
[05:12:23] <Cork> curvv: and if there is a fitting status code, sure you can
[05:12:36] <Cork> but often you might want to include it in the response
[05:12:43] <Cork> depends on the structure of the data you send
[05:15:50] <Mark____> i have a question: how do i make a layer slide from the leftside as i open the page, and slides back to the left as i leave the page?
[05:16:03] <Mark____> like this website.  http://www.layoutskin.com/portfolio
[05:16:12] <curvv> Cork: thanks
[05:16:18] <curvv> so if it's not a known server or http error, i should just include it in the response...
[05:16:27] <Cork> curvv: yes
[05:18:08] <Cork> Mark____: the slide in is quite easy just have an animation as the page loads
[05:18:23] <Cork> Mark____: animating on page leave is harder and i don't see that page doing it
[05:18:33] <Cork> (harder == not really supported)
[05:18:42] <Mark____> http://q.cyworld.com/30213840 <â€” this oneâ€™s doing it
[05:19:15] <Mark____> but i think it has to load many layers just for that one website though
[05:19:39] <Mark____> can you tell me how i can let it just play by itself?
[05:19:40] <Cork> no they animate as you ajax load content into the current page
[05:19:48] <Mark____> oh really
[05:47:12] <mms_> hi I am making ajax call using jquery $getJSON and some how its leading into error fuction though to me response looks good.  am I doing some thign wrong ? http://pastie.org/9678507  ...   http://imagebin.org/322602
[05:49:42] <Cork> mms_: most likely a parsing error
[05:49:56] <Cork> mms_: try attaching a .fail function
[05:50:07] <mms_> Cork: its going into the failure one already
[05:50:23] <mms_> see the snippet its leading into error handler function
[05:50:30] <Cork> hmm json taks it as an argument
[05:50:32] <Cork> didn't know that
[05:50:46] <mms_> let me add the raw text returned
[05:51:00] <Cork> mms_: also don't use alert for debugging
[05:51:06] <Cork> use console.log
[05:51:16] <mms_> I know alert I used only in error
[05:51:23] <mms_> I want use to see that
[05:51:41] <Cork> also check the third argument to the callback
[05:51:52] <Cork> it contains the parsing error if there is one
[05:51:57] <mms_> http://pastie.org/9678528
[05:52:06] <mms_> check that I added response captured using fiddler
[05:52:15] <mms_> how come then query has issue parsing it ?
[05:52:23] <mms_> or in general ajax call has issue parsing it
[05:52:43] <Cork> firstly make sure it has error parsing it
[05:54:19] <Cork> mms_: also as you pass dynamic values you might want to switch to $.ajax
[05:54:35] <Cork> as that should give cleaner code
[05:54:40] <mms_> ok
[05:54:53] <mms_> but for now it seems some thing weird is happening
[05:55:14] <Cork> can't really help you with that until you grab all the error data
[05:55:16] <mms_> response looks fine but still goes to error handler
[05:55:23] <mms_> how to grab all ?
[05:55:27] <mms_> I have alreayd given all
[05:55:34] <Cork> no
[05:55:41] <mms_> then what else and how ?
[05:55:44] <Cork> "it calls the error callback" is not all the error data
[05:55:50] <Cork> see my earlier comments
[05:55:54] <Cork> i've asked for it twice
[05:56:05] <mms_> sorry let me check
[05:56:56] <mms_> third argument to callback ?
[05:57:01] <Cork> yes
[05:57:03] <mms_> I have only two args
[05:57:26] <Cork> no you have one
[05:57:33] <Cork> you only define "error"
[05:57:38] <Cork> though that should be xhr
[05:58:19] <Cork> hmm
[05:58:28] <Cork> mms_: i just checked the docs one more time
[05:58:35] <mms_> Cork: I am confused...i pass two functions to then function
[05:58:38] <Cork> mms_: and $.getJSON does NOT take an error handler
[05:58:57] <mms_> Cork: I used deferred then
[05:59:04] <mms_> it takes 3 args
[05:59:09] <Cork> you could, but you arn't
[05:59:22] <Cork> ah wait
[05:59:23] <Cork> then
[05:59:29] <mms_> I have not passed error handler to getJOSN
[05:59:55] <Cork> ok, then ya, define the correct arguments to the handler and you should get more info
[06:00:10] <mms_> well I already did
[06:00:16] <mms_> tell me what to correct
[06:00:26] <mms_> I have provided the handlers what more ?
[06:00:33] <Cork> more arguments
[06:00:41] <Cork> you only grab the xhr as "error"
[06:00:42] <mms_> last argument is progress
[06:00:45] <mms_> its optional too
[06:00:58] <Cork> sure, but you don't know what fails if you don't grab the data...
[06:00:59] <mms_> let me give that too
[06:01:08] <Cork> if the code throws and you ignore the message
[06:01:16] <Cork> you can't know why
[06:01:26] <mms_> let me add the last additional arg
[06:03:38] <mms_> its going onnly into error
[06:04:14] <Cork> and?
[06:04:52] <mms_> http://www.jioworld.com/cgi-bin/get_jio_id.py?phone=+919869002979
[06:04:54] <mms_> try that query
[06:05:01] <Cork> sigh...
[06:05:04] <mms_> that is what I am trying using ajax
[06:05:10] <mms_> not sure why ajax fails
[06:05:17] <Cork> give me the message from the throwError variable...
[06:05:40] <mms_> I just printed it using alert
[06:05:54] <Cork> and?
[06:05:56] <mms_> does it have some attribute on the error object that  you want ?
[06:06:00] <Cork> ...
[06:06:02] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[06:06:07] <mms_> the essage is there in image
[06:06:11] <Cork> scroll down to .fail
[06:06:24] <Cork> the "errorThrown" variable is what i need
[06:08:35] <mms_> jqXHR.then(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {}, function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {});
[06:08:37] <mms_> ???
[06:08:45] <Cork> yes
[06:08:53] <mms_> so how do I change my code ?
[06:08:59] <mms_> replace .getJSON ?
[06:09:02] <Cork> except the first function doens't take textStatus
[06:09:03] <mms_> with .ajax ?
[06:09:15] <Cork> uh you know what code you have written right?
[06:09:26] <mms_> I have written .getJSON
[06:09:30] <Cork> no
[06:09:33] <mms_> what ?
[06:09:44] <Cork> deferred.then is a short hand for deferred.done().fail()
[06:10:11] <sacho_> not in 1.8+
[06:10:19] <kojitsu> Hello, i would like to know if it's possible to sort button inside a div, using the mouse ?
[06:10:22] <Cork> well it is actually supposed to be used to merge multiple deferres
[06:10:22] <mms_> no....it takes success, failure and progress
[06:10:30] <Cork> but it can be used for it
[06:10:38] <Cork> mms_: yes
[06:10:47] <Cork> and in what way is that contra to what i just said?
[06:10:51] <mms_> then I am confused what you expect me to do to pick up
[06:10:54] <sacho_> in 1.8+, .then() returns a new promise
[06:11:15] <Cork> mms_: i expect you to grab all the arguments it passes to your fail function
[06:11:21] <Cork> and not ignore two third of them
[06:12:17] <sacho_> mms_, go to the network tab and check out the actual response :)
[06:12:23] <mms_> ok
[06:12:31] <Cork> sacho_: that most likely won't help
[06:12:49] <Cork> as error is also called for parsing errors
[06:12:57] <Cork> and those don't show up in the network tab or console
[06:13:07] <Cork> you need to grab the error argument
[06:13:25] * sacho_ shrugs
[06:13:27] <mms_> sacho_: {"phone": "+919869002979", "uid": "MitenMehta"}
[06:13:35] <mms_> http://www.jioworld.com/cgi-bin/get_jio_id.py?phone=+919869002979
[06:13:42] <Cork> sigh
[06:13:48] <Cork> have fun i've had enough
[06:14:02] <kojitsu> Somebody knows if i can use sortable() for my buttons in my div ?
[06:14:12] <sacho_> well, that's valid json
[06:14:24] <mms_> thats what I do not understand
[06:14:33] <mms_> whats going in my code snippet that it jumps into fail
[06:14:53] <sacho_> try console.log(arguments) in your error function, instead
[06:15:05] <Cork> sacho_: heh good way around it :)
[06:15:13] <mms_> ok
[06:15:14] <sacho_> wait, is that jsonp?
[06:15:28] <Cork> it has a callback so ya
[06:15:31] <Cork> AH >_<
[06:15:39] <Cork> yes he is returning json for a jsonp call
[06:15:50] <sacho_> but it's not really a jsonp call, I don't see any jsonp config
[06:15:59] <Cork> in the url
[06:16:03] <Cork> &callback=
[06:16:10] <MikeD_> what do you recommend for a confirmation box with a Yes/No question (and buttons) ?
[06:16:11] <sacho_> oh nvm, it checks the url
[06:16:25] <sacho_> mms_, yeah, your response is json, not jsonp
[06:16:35] <Cork> MikeD_: you could use jquery ui if you like
[06:16:46] <Cork> MikeD_: or window.confirm (kinda nasty though)
[06:17:20] <MikeD_> confirm uses OK/Cancel buttons
[06:17:22] <sacho_> mms_, you need a .js file that calls callback() and passes the json as the first parameter
[06:17:31] <mms_> hi you right
[06:17:42] <mms_> I removed the callback and now it seems to go in fine
[06:17:49] <Cork> sacho_: no it need to call the name passed in the callback get variable
[06:17:52] <mms_> sacho_: I removed callback
[06:17:57] <Cork> not statically callback
[06:18:00] <sacho_> ok, great
[06:18:38] <Cork> kojitsu: your question doens't really make sense, what is it you're trying to do=
[06:21:34] <kojitsu> Cork, my div contains some buttons, and i would like to move them, sort them
[06:21:43] <Gmac_> so i found a bug that only happens in chrome
[06:21:55] <Cork> kojitsu: ah, that should work yes
[06:22:13] <Cork> Gmac_: lovely, another one...
[06:22:34] <Gmac_> where i try to get offset().top of an li. if i use classes I get the right li, if I use li[data-soething] i get a different number
[06:22:36] <Cork> Gmac_: checked the bugtracker?
[06:22:38] <kojitsu> Cork, i just tested it but nothing happend, it dont work
[06:22:47] <Gmac_> it works well in firefox and safari and chrome it acts weird
[06:23:48] <Gmac_> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1090829/html/index.html
[06:24:01] <Gmac_> also chrome cant load my jquer from inside dropbox...
[06:24:21] <Gmac_> in that link if you scroll the second box under the big 70 the year should change
[06:24:30] <Gmac_> it works in safari and firefox not chrome
[06:25:10] <seaders> hey guys
[06:25:19] <seaders> quick question for jquery mobile
[06:25:21] <Cork> Gmac_: file it at bugs.jquery.com
[06:25:38] <seaders> Am I able to have a styled header as the header for a collapsible?
[06:25:55] <seaders> any effort I try at that assumes the header is the content to show/hide
[06:26:33] <seaders> and if I can't do it automagically
[06:26:47] <seaders> what's the best way to replicate what collapsibles give me?
[06:26:47] <Cork> kojitsu: ya, looks like buttons breaks it
[06:27:07] <Cork> kojitsu: looks like the event doesn't bubble or something like that
[06:27:19] <kojitsu> Cork: i would like to do like the exemple here => http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#display-grid but instead i want buttons
[06:27:39] <kojitsu> Cork: any solutions ? i tried to add ul & li but still dont work
[06:27:50] <Cork> kojitsu: use ex. <span> instead
[06:28:47] <kojitsu> span instead div ?
[06:28:56] <Cork> kojitsu: http://jsfiddle.net/8d5beze2/1/
[06:29:23] <Cork> kojitsu: <button> is a replaced element, it looks like it breaks sortable
[06:30:51] <kojitsu> Cork: Damn
[06:31:04] <kojitsu> Cork: so i can't do anything ?
[06:31:17] <Cork> kojitsu: look for a bug report/file one
[06:31:25] <Cork> i haven't looked into why this doesn't work
[06:31:37] <Cork> it might be fixable from the plugins side
[06:31:40] <Cork> i have no clue
[06:32:14] <tirengarfio> what indicates an index after a selector? I mean what is the difference between this: var foo = $('div')[0].outerHTML; and this: var foo = $('div').outerHTML; ??
[06:32:30] <kojitsu> Cork: Okay thx for answering me :)
[06:32:46] <Cork> tirengarfio: the first looks for a property "outerHTML" on the dom element
[06:32:56] <Cork> tirengarfio: the second one looks for it on the jquery object
[06:33:05] <Cork> kojitsu: good luck
[06:33:55] <tirengarfio> Cork, any link to read about this? what is the "name" of this?
[06:34:30] <Cork> tirengarfio: $() returns an array like object
[06:34:41] <Cork> tirengarfio: [0] just grabs the first element from the array
[06:34:54] <Cork> kinda like ([1,2,3])[0] == 1
[06:35:33] <Cork> js> print(([1,2,3])[0] == 1)
[06:35:51] <Cork> ah its dead
[06:36:50] <BillCriswell> Cork: You murderer.
[06:37:13] <Cork> who? meee?
[06:37:48] <BillCriswell> You killed er.
[06:37:50] <BillCriswell> Cork: Why the ()?
[06:37:52] <dg__> Hey, I am just learning JQuery and wondering if there is a function already for accessing the window.location object's variables. For instance (example.com/?foo=bar). I want to be able to select foo and get bar.
[06:38:02] <seaders> hey guys, anyone who can possibly help me / point me in the right direction?  been driven mental by this, and no response from the jquery mobile forum, or stackoverflow
[06:38:08] <Cork> BillCriswell: to make sure the parser doesn't puke on [][]
[06:38:11] <dg__> Is there anything already pre built to do this? I'm seeing a lot of regex solutions on SO, but seems like this should be easier.
[06:38:24] <BillCriswell> Cork: Oh. Never worried about that... maybe I will now lol
[06:38:51] <Cork> BillCriswell: i don't think you need to, i just didn't want to care :)
[06:39:00] <BillCriswell> Cork: Ah ok.
[06:39:14] <Cork> can't say often write [val, val, val][0]
[06:39:24] <Cork> so wasn't sure it was valid ^^'
[06:39:41] <BillCriswell> dg__: jQuery has nothing for that sort of thing.
[06:39:49] <BillCriswell> Cork: I got ya.
[06:39:52] <tirengarfio> thanks Cork
[06:39:55] <Cork> dg__: there is a few plugins for it
[06:40:09] <dg__> It requires plugins?
[06:40:13] <Cork> yes
[06:40:52] <dg__> Cork: Do you know what I could search on to see what's out there? I'm trying to make a modification to an existing app. It's pretty big, so it might contain the plugin or another framework that has it?
[06:41:10] <Cork> dg__: like this one for example https://github.com/allmarkedup/purl
[06:41:14] <Cork> (there are others)
[06:41:36] <dg__> Cork: Okay, thanks. Odds are they're using regex too I bet.
[06:41:55] <Cork> i THINK it is using document.createElement('a')
[06:42:09] <dg__> Yea, there's a large regex parser in this.
[06:42:13] <Cork> i know one of them did last i checked
[06:42:42] <dg__> Cork: I might as well just use a small regex script myself. I was hoping not to do that, but including an entire framework that's just going to implementing something like this makes little since to add the overhead.
[06:43:00] <Cork> dg__: that isn't a framework
[06:43:02] <Cork> far from it
[06:43:06] <dg__> Sorry (plugin)
[06:43:26] <Cork> but ya an a element can get you quite a bit on the way
[06:43:37] <Cork> it doesn't allow you to separate the path parts
[06:43:40] <Cork> or parse the query
[06:43:42] <BillCriswell> The regex one on SO with 80 upvotes looks pretty good to me.
[06:43:47] <Cork> but it provides the rest
[06:43:56] <dg__> BillCriswell: That's what I have been looking at.
[06:44:10] <dg__> BillCriswell: I would've thought this type of functionality would've been built into jQuery.
[06:44:54] <Cork> dg__: it is quite a bit from a normal task
[06:45:08] <Cork> s/normal/common/
[06:46:06] <Cork> dg__: also you know window.location provides some separation by default?
[06:46:17] <Cork> like .search .path .domain and so on?
[06:46:32] <dg__> Cork: Yep, I was writing a "guide" on the location object. That's how I have been learning.
[06:46:57] <Hetachi> Hi, does jquery have to be before div that I apply it or after the div ?
[06:47:18] <dg__> Cork: location: host, hostname, origin, pathname, port, protocol, search, hash
[06:47:18] <Cork> Hetachi: you should separate out js from the content
[06:47:32] <Cork> Hetachi: jquery.js should be included in head
[06:47:42] <Hetachi> ah I see okay thank you
[06:47:52] <Cork> and the code for it should either be wrapped in $(function() {}) and in head
[06:48:03] <Cork> or without at the end of body
[06:48:15] <Cork> <script> $(); </script></body>
[06:48:49] <dg__> Hetachi: If you include it in a separate file and include it near the bottom before body close, you will prevent it from blocking rendering of the HTML above it.
[06:49:13] <Cork> well it won't block if it is inline
[06:49:21] <Cork> but it also means you won't get good caching
[06:49:28] <Cork> so ya, keep your js in a separate file
[07:08:57] <Stummi> Hi, is there something to format a decimal number using a format string? (preferrable c-style formats like "%2.3f")
[07:09:28] <Cork> not really
[07:09:56] <Cork> the closest that exist is toFixed
[07:10:00] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FNumber%2FtoFixed
[07:10:06] <Cork> ugg
[07:10:16] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed
[07:10:17] <Stummi> okay, but you can't use it to add leading zeros or spaces?
[07:10:23] <Cork> no
[07:10:32] <Cork> the simplest is to use a string with .slice
[07:10:47] <Cork> "             ".slice(length)
[07:11:39] <Stummi> okay, thanks. I assume its the same when I ask about date/time format strings?
[07:11:48] <Cork> Stummi: yes
[07:12:00] <Cork> well it is actually worse there
[07:12:18] <Cork> cause there isn't anything to parse dates reliably in the language
[07:13:07] <Stummi> yeah, I just want to format it. Javascript really needs to do something with its standard library ;)
[07:13:26] <Cork> well es7 might bring something
[07:21:09] <tirengarfio> at this code: Im replacing some text of an element. Next I want to render visible the object, but I don't know how. this is th code: http://jsfiddle.net/d5t7h26g/1/
[07:22:47] <pedda> hi there
[07:23:38] <pedda> i have a general jquery question: what is required, in order to access a map (Gmaps.js) object in one place, which is instanciated in some other place
[07:23:44] <pedda> can i access it at all?
[07:24:19] <Cork> tirengarfio: why are you serializing the element instead of just modify its content?
[07:25:10] <Cork> tirengarfio: http://jsfiddle.net/d5t7h26g/3/
[07:26:12] <tirengarfio> because the "hello" of your example, in my case is an eleemnt
[07:26:41] <djam90> Hi, is it possible to programatically (as in, not by drag+drop) move items from one sortable to another sortable in jQuery UI ? Or at least, move items from one sortable to another div (like DELETED ITEMS)
[07:26:58] <tirengarfio> an big element where I want to replace some strings
[07:27:10] <tirengarfio> well, some big, not too much :)
[07:28:40] <tirengarfio> I should replace the __name__, with a number
[07:28:50] <tirengarfio> here: &lt;div&gt;&lt;label class=&quot; required&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/label&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;task_tags___name__&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;task_tags___name___name&quot; class=&quot; required&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;task_tags___name___name&quot; name=&quot;task[tags][__name__][name]&quot; required=&quot;required&quot; maxlength=&quot;255&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;
[07:28:50] <tirengarfio> /div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
[07:29:51] <Cork> tirengarfio: sure, but it is html inside the current element
[07:30:02] <Cork> no need to rip out the container element
[07:30:41] <Cork> tirengarfio: and please don't post html blobs in the channel
[07:30:41] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what's going on lol
[07:31:04] <Cork> BillCriswell: he wants to modify the text inside an element
[07:31:16] <BillCriswell> oh.
[07:31:18] <Cork> and replaced the element instead
[07:31:26] <Cork> well cloned rather
[07:31:34] <Cork> (through .after)
[07:32:49] <BillCriswell> Ah I see.
[07:34:04] <redShadow> ..anyone experienced with caching mechanisms w/ ajax requests? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26586454/ :)
[07:34:22] <BillCriswell> I wrote some code a bit ago that replaced all occurrences of a string in a string of html but left the HTML alone without a regex. Wonder if I can find that.
[07:34:34] <Cork> redShadow: pick one community when you ask
[07:34:38] <redShadow> (apparently a request that's meant to use the cache, isn't always doing so, in a weird way..)
[07:34:46] <Cork> don't ask in one and go to another and ask them to join that community...
[07:35:40] <BillCriswell> Cork: http://jsbin.com/kudanoheciti/1/edit?html,js,output weee
[07:36:00] <Cork> O_o'
[07:36:12] <Cork> lol... nice >_>
[07:36:31] <BillCriswell> Aww yeah
[07:36:50] <Cork> i always forget .html() takes a function
[07:38:02] <redShadow> Cork: I know, I don't like cross-posting either, but I asked in this channel first this morning, with no success, then posted on SO, and not getting any hint, now I'm checking again here, maybe somebody had similar experience (and I don't want to copy-paste the answer all over.. the link is handy)
[07:38:03] <redShadow> :)
[07:38:36] <Cork> redShadow: personally i just ignore so links
[07:39:12] <lsfc1914> Hello. I have a modal window with images. I want when click on image to close the window and show the image in div in my page. Can you help me?
[07:39:21] <tirengarfio> Cork, Im don't konw how to do it.. This is another try: http://jsfiddle.net/xpp9f66k/
[07:40:07] <tirengarfio> I don't know exactly what you mean with "but it htm inside the current elementç"
[07:40:53] <badams> how do I watch list elements for a data attribute change?
[07:41:14] <Cork> tirengarfio: http://jsfiddle.net/xpp9f66k/1/
[07:41:15] <badams> so if an el has a data-status=x, i do something
[07:41:28] <Cork> badams: you don't
[07:41:37] <badams> mk
[07:41:39] <Cork> or rather there isn't a cross browser way to do it
[07:42:21] <tirengarfio> well I know that option but since __name__ is repeated many times I wanted to to try with replace() :)
[07:42:45] <tirengarfio> I didn't know it was so hard ..
[07:43:16] <BillCriswell> badams: Depending how good your JS is you could look into a vmmv approach.
[07:43:23] <BillCriswell> mvvm*
[07:43:26] <badams> like knockout?
[07:43:38] <BillCriswell> Yeah, then you'd have observables.
[07:43:40] <badams> or backbone
[07:43:59] <badams> i could put all the li's under a live() handler, couldn't i?
[07:44:21] <badams> with for the change event?
[07:46:19] <BillCriswell> badams: If you are getting the value from an input or something to assign to the data attribute you could fake it I guess.
[07:46:32] <badams> the data-attr is being set by another function.
[07:46:57] <BillCriswell> You can't just fire off a "data-attr-changed" event, the function that changed that would need to do something.
[07:46:59] <badams> im just looking to do some class/ux enhancement on this and wanted thought about putting the UX tweaks in his various kludgy functions,
[07:47:16] <badams> but then occurred, just target the data attr, watch for an event, and handle the ux that way
[07:47:53] <badams> If it's an li, and text within it changed, does that trigger the change event?
[07:48:25] <BillCriswell> badams: A change would only happen on a form input element or a contenteditable element's html (I think).
[07:48:33] <badams> ah.
[07:51:51] <CoolApps> Hello. I cannot seem to find the Comet plug, any idea where it is?
[07:55:07] <totesjakey> morning queriers
[08:03:15] <P0rk> How do you select for required input elements  using the html5 required attribute?
[08:05:11] <P0rk> better yet, does anyone remember the link to define your own pseudo-selectors functions in jquery?
[08:05:41] <P0rk> nvm, misspelled pseudo on my search. lol
[08:08:11] <BillCriswell> P0rk: input[required] would do it.
[08:08:24] <BillCriswell> No need for a special pseudo selector in my opinion
[08:08:52] <BillCriswell> Unless you're dynamically changing the required attribute... then maybe.
[08:09:09] <P0rk> true, thanks. I had some other special use cases that I was going to build anyways.
[08:09:19] <Cork> shouldn't matter if you dynamically change it
[08:12:29] <BillCriswell> Cork: Ah, you're right it doesnt/
[08:13:11] <BillCriswell> I thought [required] would look for the attribute in the HTML itself.
[08:14:05] <dmsuperman> well if you think about it, the HTML markup is just an API for the DOM
[08:14:21] <Cork> dmsuperman: no it isn't
[08:14:21] <dmsuperman> afaik the only thing that jquery looks at the actual markup over the DOM is the weirdly pre-populated .data() with data- attributes
[08:14:23] <Cork> not even close
[08:14:46] <dmsuperman> so specifying an attribute on the tag as setting an attribute in the DOM makes it easier to consider
[08:14:46] <Cork> html is a markup for content, that a parser can convert to a dom structure
[08:15:02] <Cork> the commands on the dom object to parse html is the api
[08:15:28] <dmsuperman> API's meaning is broader than that
[08:15:43] <BillCriswell> .prop('required', true) adds the attribute as well.
[08:15:49] <Cork> ya
[08:15:50] <BillCriswell> Wasn't expecting that.
[08:15:57] <Cork> well it doesn't add the attribute
[08:16:07] <Cork> but [] often checks the property
[08:16:08] <BillCriswell> Cork: It does.
[08:16:16] <darkfrog> I'm looking for a framework that is similar to http://rangy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/cssclassapplier.html except applies CSS styles instead of classes to the selection.
[08:16:20] <darkfrog> Any suggestions?
[08:16:26] <BillCriswell> Cork: http://jsbin.com/fuwukelewe/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:16:39] <Cork> BillCriswell: ah, correction it does it in the case where they aren't different
[08:17:00] <BillCriswell> prop/attr will forever be weird lol
[08:17:04] <Cork> BillCriswell: what i meant is [] looks at more then just attributes
[08:17:16] <Cork> it is a bit of a mess sadly
[08:18:00] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[08:18:32] <BillCriswell> Cork: Have a good one!
[08:23:39] <FilipNortic> does psp:s usally accept cors request or does it depend?
[08:27:01] <badams> shouldn't data-doc_status be set via selector.data('doc_status', 'newstatus');?
[08:31:42] <shoky> badams: no, .data() never writes to the attribute, only reads. no reason usually to actually set the attribute
[08:31:43] <BillCriswell> badams: Yes.
[08:31:58] <BillCriswell> But also what shoky said.
[08:32:00] <badams> um, so only use data to read, ?
[08:32:08] <Hejkki> hi :) I got a problem with .before and .click... if i have <a href="#" class="something">... and i have $('.something').click(function(){... if i do $('.somethingelse').before($('<a href="#" class="something">text</a>')); the new a will not work. the have $('.something').click(... will not do anything when clicking on the new link
[08:32:21] <BillCriswell> badams: .data('foo', 'bar') won't update the attribute, just the data stores in jquery.
[08:32:28] <badams> ah.
[08:32:29] <badams> ok
[08:32:39] <shoky> you can still read it with .data('foo')
[08:32:58] <badams> will it read the in-mem, or the current element attributes?
[08:33:05] <shoky> in-mem
[08:33:09] <badams> ah.
[08:33:13] <shoky> the data-* attr is only read from once
[08:33:20] <badams> ok.
[08:33:55] <Hejkki> sorry typos, but anyhow, when i add elements with jquery, the click -function isn't working
[08:33:58] <badams> so what is the standard procedure for taking your data('foo', 'bar') (in memory..) and putting it on the attr?
[08:34:09] <badams> Hejkki: live?
[08:34:23] <Hejkki> just a second, will put a demo live
[08:34:31] <badams> are you using .live()?
[08:34:42] <Hejkki> ah, ok :D
[08:34:42] <shoky> badams: the standard procedure is NOT to write back to the attribute
[08:35:13] <badams> hm, and is there a reason?
[08:35:26] <shoky> because it's slower, and unncessary (usually)
[08:36:20] <badams> well, i was trying to enhance the UI on this page and they were changin the data-doc_status attr, and I wanted to read that for logic in my ux behavious
[08:38:02] <shoky> anyways if you really want to write back to the attr for any reason, use .attr
[08:38:09] <badams> ok
[08:41:33] <Hejkki> hmm, also the $('table').length isn't being updated, it is 1 even if i add elements with jquery
[08:42:22] <BillCriswell> Hejkki: jQuery only know about elements that exist at the time you run the query.
[08:43:06] <duce1nik> how many page can you have with Jquery Mobile?
[08:43:38] <Hejkki> BillCriswell: ok
[08:43:48] <BillCriswell> duce1nik: As many as you'd need I'd imagine.
[08:44:05] <BillCriswell> duce1nik: Weird question to ask though. It sounds like you'd just want a template with lots of different data instead.
[08:44:14] <BillCriswell> Hejkki: No problem.
[08:44:22] <duce1nik> BillCriswell I can seem only to have 3
[08:44:46] <duce1nik> BillCriswell when i add more then 3  the fourth one don't work
[08:45:19] <BillCriswell> duce1nik: That would be a serious limitation that I'd have heard about. I think you might be doing something weird. Do you have a demo somewhere?
[08:46:27] <duce1nik> how can i send it to you?
[08:46:48] <duce1nik> BillCriswell how can I send it to you?
[08:47:14] <BillCriswell> A link to the actual code would be best.
[08:47:26] <BillCriswell> you can set up a small demo at jsfiddle.net as well.
[08:48:36] <duce1nik> ok
[08:49:58] <BillCriswell> duce1nik: http://jsfiddle.net/jdjqyhbo/ This link has jQuery, jQuery UI JS and CSS in it. Just put your code in the right panes and click update.
[08:50:31] <duce1nik> ok
[08:51:39] <anli> I am using img.load(handler); and then img.attr('src', url);, the problem is that handler is not called if the image is not existing, why?
[08:51:54] <robertmaxrees> because you can only bind to what exists.
[08:51:54] <anli> Should be called with parameters indication failure, should it not?
[08:52:02] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[08:52:03] <anli> indicating
[08:52:08] <robertmaxrees> jquery checks to see if it exists first.
[08:52:14] <robertmaxrees> if it doesn't, it does nothing.
[08:52:16] <anli> The img element exists
[08:52:38] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ anli
[08:52:53] <anli> ? @ robertmaxrees
[08:52:54] <robertmaxrees> awww bad b-ot.  mind sharing your code?
[08:53:05] <anli> :)
[08:53:14] <anli> Can do that
[08:53:41] <anli> http://pastebin.com/hSCFaV6v
[08:53:50] <anli> the indentation became fubar
[08:54:06] <anli> The alert "img load" is never called if the image is not existing
[08:54:34] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a jsfiddle using this?
[08:54:43] <anli> yes
[08:59:33] <duce1nik> BillCriswell done
[08:59:50] <BillCriswell> Ok, you'd have to click update and share the link.
[08:59:52] <anli> http://jsfiddle.net/dLe38q5n/
[09:00:06] <anli> I thought I had to be done with it first
[09:00:22] <anli> So I waited until that happened
[09:00:28] <robertmaxrees> anli look at your console.
[09:00:53] <duce1nik> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/jdjqyhbo/8/
[09:00:56] <anli> oh
[09:01:15] <anli> I was not ready, it seems
[09:01:28] <robertmaxrees> anli you're trying to use a function you don't define.
[09:01:36] <anli> I know
[09:01:45] <anli> I did not copy the problem correctly
[09:03:54] <anli> http://jsfiddle.net/dLe38q5n/1/
[09:04:04] <BillCriswell> duce1nik: Too many errors in that code to see what the issue is.
[09:04:49] <anli> Must reindent
[09:04:54] <robertmaxrees> anli already did.
[09:05:21] <robertmaxrees> anli i'm still not clear what the issue it - you never call "on_faliure", so you'll never see that function execute.
[09:05:48] <anli> The issue is that if I never trigger that handler on a 404
[09:06:52] <anli> img.error(on_failure); seems to solve the problem
[09:07:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:07:14] <robertmaxrees> also: you should opt for .prop() instead of .attr()
[09:07:41] <robertmaxrees> and you can use .on('load') and .on('error') instead if you want, as well.
[09:08:08] <anli> I do not like the .on methods
[09:08:21] <robertmaxrees> the other methods are just shortcuts to it, but OK.
[09:08:54] <MikeD_> i used .dialog({ position: { my: "center", at:"center", of: window } - when the dialog is already open, and the user doubleclicks the titlebar of the window to make it fit the screen, the dialog does not re-center
[09:09:33] <anli> Does even foo.on('clickx') result in a runtime error?
[09:09:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:09:49] <anli> foo.clickx(handler) does
[09:09:53] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to do .on('click', function() {}); like normal
[09:09:59] <anli> yes, I know
[09:10:03] <robertmaxrees> .clickx() isn't a method.
[09:10:07] <anli> What I am talking about is accident
[09:10:08] <robertmaxrees> you can use any event name you want.
[09:10:08] <anli> Exactly
[09:10:30] <anli> So if I am trying to use .clickx, I get a runtime error, which is the way I like most
[09:10:35] <robertmaxrees> okay
[09:10:44] <anli> A tighter contract
[09:10:58] <MikeD_> also, modal: true is still too transparent... is there a way to make the overlay more opaque?
[09:11:01] <robertmaxrees> i prefer .on() since i can use any event name i want, but whatever works best for you.
[09:11:27] <anli> Yes .on() has that advantage, but I never make up event names, at least not very often
[09:12:08] <anli> Thanks for the input
[09:12:10] <duce1nik> BillCriswell got
[09:12:17] <robertmaxrees> neither do I ;) but fair enough.
[09:12:18] <anli> Now my image loader works nicely
[09:12:23] <anli> :)
[09:12:25] <duce1nik> BillCriswell after i fix the error it work
[09:16:05] <BillCriswell> duce1nik: Nice. So you're good?
[09:16:15] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/u9zqvbds/ -> is this the right way to go about finding the .children anchor and triggering a click if you click the parent div?
[09:16:32] <duce1nik> BillCriswell yup Thanks
[09:16:38] <BillCriswell> duce1nik: Awesome.
[09:16:41] <b-lew> trying to get rid of those data-rels
[09:16:44] <BillCriswell> Welcome. Though you did all the work haha.
[09:17:08] <robertmaxrees> b-lew are you just trying to make an entire area clickable?
[09:17:47] <PhonicUK> how can I use .animate() between X and Y with a callback for the intermediate values?
[09:17:51] <duce1nik> BillCriswell you pointed out I had error hahah
[09:17:54] <b-lew> I am robertmaxrees
[09:18:07] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK: I think there's a step function?
[09:18:09] <duce1nik> BillCriswell it a team work ahah
[09:18:09] <robertmaxrees> b-lew why not just wrap the whole thing in anchor tag then?
[09:18:11] <b-lew> I want the parent div to go to the child anchor
[09:18:15] <BillCriswell> duce1nik: Awesome.
[09:18:37] <b-lew> like wrap the entire "module" in an anchor?
[09:18:41] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK: Yup, step.
[09:18:42] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:19:04] <PhonicUK> BillCriswell, I see it - but the documentation doesn't explain what "now" actually is
[09:19:07] <MikeD_> is it a feature of the modal UI behavior to put a light gray strip through the middle of the overlay?
[09:19:15] <PhonicUK> is it between 0 and 1, start->en...
[09:19:15] <tirengarfio> how can I convert this: "&lt;div&gt;&lt;label class=&quot;" to HTML?
[09:19:34] <PhonicUK> tirengarfio, "blahblah".unescape();
[09:19:53] <b-lew> I'm unsure I was just going off of what a co-worker had started. I didn't think wrapping everything in an anchor was proper.
[09:19:56] <robertmaxrees> that's deprecated, PhonicUK
[09:20:00] <PhonicUK> so it is
[09:20:11] <PhonicUK> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/unescape-html-in-js/
[09:20:13] <robertmaxrees> look at decodeURI and decodeURIComponent
[09:20:42] <robertmaxrees> b-lew https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a
[09:20:50] <robertmaxrees> totally valid to do that ;)
[09:21:03] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, stick with using data attributes to store the URL instead.
[09:21:22] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK: I'd just console.log and see.
[09:21:24] <shoky> PhonicUK:  now: the numeric value of the property being animated at each step
[09:21:43] <PhonicUK> righto, how can I run .animate() without selecting an element?
[09:21:48] <b-lew> data-attr are fine but you can' t control which anchor has a target blank
[09:21:48] <PhonicUK> can I just do $.animate(..) ?
[09:22:41] <PhonicUK> ocrap, is the api docs down for anyone else?
[09:22:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:23:06] <b-lew> sounds good thanks robertmaxrees you're the best!

[09:23:33] <PhonicUK> maybe the local CF nodes connection to api.jq... is down
[09:23:42] <robertmaxrees> maybe.
[09:24:42] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK: http://jsbin.com/lamepuhexu/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:25:06] <PhonicUK> BillCriswell, I'm not animating an element like that though, so I'm wanting to just use .animate
[09:25:21] <robertmaxrees> PhonicUK what exactly are you trying to do?
[09:26:02] <PhonicUK> where I've got someElement.scrollTop = someElement.scrollHeight, I'm trying to animate that transition - but it doesn't work if I do it the way you'd expect
[09:28:30] <robertmaxrees> could you show us the code you've got now, then?
[09:29:11] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK: http://jsbin.com/lamepuhexu/2/edit?css,js,output ?
[09:30:14] <PhonicUK> 1 tick
[09:30:31] <MikeD_> is this thing on?  Are my questions just not interesting enough?  [i understand, :) ]
[09:30:55] <gf3> MikeD_: well tbh it's just a bad question
[09:30:58] <BillCriswell> I think I missed it MikeD_.
[09:31:23] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK: So what do you need the animate for?
[09:31:33] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ check out the docs and look at the example?
[09:32:08] <MikeD_> UI position - it seems like the position is calculate and set in px, rather than left as 'center' so it responds with the window change... am I missing something?
[09:32:09] <PhonicUK> BillCriswell, its updating constantly, and a 'snap' if I just set it is jarring
[09:32:30] <MikeD_> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[09:32:55] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ so you're working why option-position doesn't update on resize?
[09:33:18] <MikeD_> yes, do I just re-specify the position on the resize event?
[09:33:32] <MikeD_> seems dumb, but i don't care that much if that's the workaround
[09:33:39] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK: I'm sorry not following lol
[09:33:51] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ http://stackoverflow.com/a/3060895/923919
[09:33:54] <PhonicUK> sorry I'm not explaining well - I'm showing a live log file as its updated
[09:33:56] <robertmaxrees> that should be all.
[09:34:07] <PhonicUK> so new lines in the log means more lines in the container object in the browser
[09:34:18] <PhonicUK> so it scrolls to the bottom when new lines are added
[09:34:23] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[09:34:35] <MikeD_> thanks, woulnd't have thought of that
[09:35:04] <PhonicUK> I seem to have it working for now :)
[09:35:27] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[09:40:12] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK: http://jsbin.com/lamepuhexu/3/edit?html,js,output is what I ended up with for fun.
[09:43:15] <PhonicUK> is there a list of the 'default' easing functions?
[09:43:58] <PhonicUK> nevermind, got it
[09:50:28] <PhonicUK> .animate() likes to break if you call it twice on the same element before the first one finishes xD
[09:50:54] <BillCriswell> PhonicUK: .stop() help?
[09:51:09] <PhonicUK> just about to check
[09:51:21] <shoky> if you ever need full control of animations.. https://gist.github.com/gnarf/54829d408993526fe475
[09:51:50] <PhonicUK> I take it .stop() halts *all* animations on that element?
[09:53:39] <robertmaxrees> PhonicUK yep - "When .stop() is called on an element, the currently-running animation (if any) is immediately stopped."
[09:54:23] <BillCriswell> There is a "queue" option so you can separate the animations into different queues if need to.
[09:54:24] <shoky> depends on the arguments. with no arguments it just stops the current one and the next queued one should animte
[09:54:36] <robertmaxrees> ah, that's right.
[09:54:38] <robertmaxrees> queueing
[09:55:09] <BillCriswell> I just make a 15 task take like 3 minutes through some clever UIery.
[09:55:12] <BillCriswell> Is that a word yet?
[09:55:21] <robertmaxrees> it it is now.
[09:55:25] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[09:55:54] <BillCriswell> I wish I could focus today.
[09:56:12] <robertmaxrees> word.  rough weekend?
[09:56:48] <BillCriswell> Nah, just a rough day ahead of me tomorrow mentally. Hopefully it goes well though.
[09:57:13] <digital-ghost> Heya, I'm trying to figure out an approach to replacing a query variable. Using a paging system and I want to detect if the last item on the page is deleted, "change" the url query parameter to the page before it. But I don't know how I can set the specific parameter. Does this make sense?
[09:57:59] <digital-ghost> It looks like, www.mysite.com/index.html?page=2, I want to access "page=2" and change it to "page=1"
[09:58:59] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell oh?  job interview or something?
[09:59:13] <robertmaxrees> digital-ghost window.location.search is the querystring.
[09:59:27] <robertmaxrees> a little regex to find the one you want should be all you need.
[09:59:38] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Nah, family thing.
[09:59:52] <digital-ghost> robertmaxrees: Yea, I guess what I want is to set the query string.
[10:00:08] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell best of luck then.
[10:00:15] <BillCriswell> Thanks.
[10:00:20] <robertmaxrees> digital-ghost pretty simple then.  where are you getting stuck?
[10:00:24] <digital-ghost> robertmaxrees: I have a method I just made that gets the parameters into a hash. Now I want to just set the particular param before the reload.
[10:00:55] <robertmaxrees> digital-ghost you'll have to manually construct the URL then.
[10:01:04] <digital-ghost> robertmaxrees: That's where I am having trouble.
[10:01:13] <digital-ghost> robertmaxrees: I'm not actually sure where to turn to heh
[10:01:19] <digital-ghost> robertmaxrees: Sort of "learning" as I go at the moment
[10:01:30] <Duvdevan> <3
[10:01:33] <robertmaxrees> craft the string you want, then set window.location.href to that value.
[10:05:10] <digital-ghost> robertmaxrees: Ok.. going to look at it again and see how/if I can do that.
[10:05:14] <digital-ghost> robertmaxrees: Thanks.
[10:09:18] <gurke_> hello... anyone used typed.js? iam trying to make an existing text in html look a like getting typed

[10:11:37] <anli_> Do I have some ckeditor plugin writers in here?
[10:11:51] <anli_> I do not know where to discuss
[10:12:16] <Yottabyte> Hey guys, following the learn jquery guide from the title and using the .html() method as a setter for some dom element, but it's removing all of the stuff below that dom element
[10:12:35] <Yottabyte> I just want it to change a certain element I click
[10:13:18] <jphase> Yottabyte: then whatever is before .html() is selecting a different element than you're expecting
[10:14:07] <Yottabyte> how do I add something to the page with jquery? just append it to the bottom of the page or something, not knowing what I'm appending after
[10:15:02] <jphase> $('#some-element').append( $('<h1>').text('hi there') );
[10:15:06] <Yottabyte> I think that's my problem. I'm changing a <p>'s html if I click it but then appending something to it
[10:15:59] <jphase> some ppl prefer to put the text inside the element instead of using .text() - they do the same thing
[10:16:30] <anli_> .text() gives you some escaping
[10:16:30] <Yottabyte> jphase I want to add it to the end of my page
[10:16:36] <Yottabyte> I don't have some element with id #some-element
[10:17:06] <jphase> $('body').append( $('<div>something</div>') );   <---
[10:17:14] <jphase> change the selector to whatever you need
[10:17:51] <anli_> It does not seem that any plugins in ckeditor uses the plugin interface, there is no plugin.js in each directory, for instance, can anyone tell me how it works?
[10:18:02] <anli_> Maybe I should read the code
[10:22:07] <anli_> Seems like a minified ckeditor does not use the same file structure
[10:22:44] <gurke_> anyone can help me please?
[10:26:42] <robertmaxrees> gurke_ what have you tried so far?
[10:26:51] <gurke_> robertmaxrees http://plnkr.co/edit/IpRa6S9awxqXW4v8xN84?p=preview
[10:27:21] <gurke_> i tried to get the text of an existing element.. and want to animate it with typing effect
[10:29:04] <robertmaxrees> gurke_ you just pass the sentences to the typed method under the strings array.
[10:29:27] <gurke_> robertmaxrees i do that by this.text()?
[10:29:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:29:55] <gurke_> but it does not work
[10:29:59] <gurke_> weird
[10:30:06] <gurke_> take a look at my plunk
[10:30:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you want.

[11:10:54] <kmhosny> Hi, im trying to get the value from an input tag type file, "$("input[name=pic]").val()" but it returns the file's name not the absolute URL, how can i return the absolute URL?
[11:11:21] <BillCriswell> kmhosny: You mean like on the users computer?
[11:11:54] <kmhosny> BillCriswell : yes
[11:12:13] <BillCriswell> You can't.
[11:13:17] <kmhosny> BillCriswell: is there a way to ge the file's path? im trying to avoid form action cause i need to stay on the same page
[11:13:43] <kmhosny> BillCriswell: that's why i tried to get it with jquery
[11:13:56] <robertmaxrees> he just said you can't.
[11:15:11] <csd_> anyone know of existing code that would convert <table> data to csv format
[11:16:59] <robertmaxrees> google search could probably help you there.
[11:21:59] <BillCriswell> csd_: Wouldn't be too tough to code out yourself either.
[11:22:34] <BillCriswell> csd_: Also, not sure on the needs for the CSV. But if you copy and paste from a table into an excel file it'll put it in the right rows / columns.
[11:24:43] <csd_> BillCriswell: Working on a small web app that displays dynamic data in a table. That's easy--I just use a small for loop and spit the data out. But I want to add a charting library that uses CSV. So I'm debating whether to convert the table data or, covert the data server side and return that in addition to the table data, or to pass JSON data that generates both the table and the chart...
[11:24:56] <robertmaxrees> server-side
[11:25:03] <robertmaxrees> you already have the data there.
[11:27:24] <doug64k> csv is about as simple as a data file can get
[11:27:41] <doug64k> the only non-trivial thing would be quoting in the strings
[11:27:48] <csd_> is it best practice to generate the <table> html server side too? or to send JSON data + JS to create the table and chart
[11:28:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd generate html and csv server-side.
[11:28:31] <csd_> i think i'm confusing myself because of the different representations of the same data
[11:31:36] <BillCriswell> csd_: http://papaparse.com/ could be useful.
[11:33:04] <decx> there are more pas' in there than in modern family
[11:33:30] <csd_> ill check it out thx
[11:33:46] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha the whole site is written kind of... I don't even know the word.
[11:34:54] <decx> i know what you mean
[11:35:01] <decx> the writing style is
[11:35:03] <decx> what's a good word
[11:35:07] <decx> quaint?
[11:36:34] <BillCriswell> That could work.
[11:37:16] <BillCriswell> It's almost like the author is a pimp or some sort?
[11:37:29] <BillCriswell> Maybe it's just the word "Papa".
[11:46:19] <cj> hey folks.  is there a way to get a variable passed to the ajax complete function handler?
[11:46:25] <cj> I want to use this as a caching key
[11:47:12] <cj> I suppose I could use the URL that was requested as the key, but I don't know how to get this from the complete function handler, either
[11:48:06] <decx> this.url
[11:48:10] <ccmonster> how do I include just a function from one js file in another for require.js?
[11:49:16] <BillCriswell> You would just export one function from what I understand.
[11:49:20] <cj> hey, thanks decx
[12:12:12] <dtrott> In the following what is the relative precedence between the space and the comma:  $("thead input[type=text],select")  specifically does the thead apply to select ?
[12:14:35] <shoky> dtrott: comma has higher precedence. so it's "thead input[type=text]" or "select"
[12:15:44] <dtrott> shoky: Thank you, so can I use parenthesis to include both ?
[12:16:07] <dtrott> i.e.: $("thead (input[type=text],select)â€)
[12:16:13] <shoky> no
[12:16:54] <shoky> that'd be  "thead input[type=text], thead select" i guess
[12:17:12] <dtrott> K, Thanks
[12:17:16] <shoky> just like css selectors
[12:17:25] <dtrott> Still pretty new to thisâ€¦.
[12:19:13] <shoky> dtrott: you can also do $("thead").find("input[type=text], select")
[12:19:34] <dtrott> Which way would you consider best ?
[12:21:15] <shoky> the last one probably, depends on the context tho
[12:36:44] <quuxman> So I have a CSS animation triggered by a timeout, but I want it to not run at all if tab isn't visible, like how the requestAnimationFrame callback works
[12:37:20] <quuxman> but I don't want to run the callback to maybe do a CSS animation every 10 milliseconds that only does something every 6 seconds
[12:37:34] <quuxman> is there a way to poll that state?
[12:38:07] <quuxman> Ah, when the animation is triggered, it could add a requestanimationframe callback, and if it gets called, continue the animation, otherwise remove it!
[12:38:12] <quuxman> thanks guys
[12:45:49] <doug64k> quuxman: you can set several timeouts at once you know
[12:45:57] <doug64k> they are all independent
[12:46:21] <lexbuck> I've got a div with <p><br></p> inside it. I'm attempting to use jquery to remove the p tag from the div if and only if the contents of the p tag is "<br>." alert($('froala-element p').html()); keeps giving me "undefined" and I'm not sure why
[12:46:46] <doug64k> lexbuck: because there is no frola-element tag. add a .
[12:47:01] <ChoboBilly> hi, is there a way to remove the white flash that occurs when a webpage loads
[12:47:24] <doug64k> lexbuck: .frola-element p    <-- that I can believe
[12:47:41] <lexbuck> doug64k Well... dammit. I've been looking at this for 30 minutes. That was it
[12:47:42] <lexbuck> thanks
[12:47:55] <doug64k> np
[12:52:08] <lexbuck> Another question. I have: https://dpaste.de/hkMY. This works, but seems redundant? Why doesn't $(this).remove(); work for that second line?
[12:53:00] <doug64k> lexbuck: I doubt that == matches. probably whitespace there
[12:53:27] <doug64k> or the browser has changed the br a bit
[12:53:59] <doug64k> lexbuck: I wouldn't use .html(). try .text()
[12:54:08] <lexbuck> doug64k hmmm ok. Thanks. let me try that
[12:54:25] <lexbuck> doug64k I'm a noob... I thought for html elements I just had to use .html.
[12:55:23] <lexbuck> doug64k .text() doesn't remove the p tag while .html() does
[12:55:40] <doug64k> no, I meant use .text to read the content
[12:56:40] <doug64k> lexbuck: do you have a fiddle?
[12:56:52] <Robdgreat> nero had one
[12:56:54] <lexbuck> doug64k No, I don't. I can make one real quick.
[12:57:12] <doug64k> lexbuck: then I can test my suggestions first :)
[12:58:16] <doug64k> Robdgreat: exactly, and we all know how amazing he would have been at web development if their computers weren't so bad
[13:03:30] <doug64k> lexbuck: find that? http://www.jstraight.com/1124/1
[13:03:49] <lexbuck> doug64k This is what I'm working with: http://jsfiddle.net/kotrqjvt/ although I can't make it work with ONLY the <br> tag in the <p> as nothing is showing up on the screen in fiddle to remove
[13:05:45] <doug64k> lexbuck: you need event.preventDefault() (don't miss the event parameter)  http://jsfiddle.net/kotrqjvt/1/
[13:06:04] <doug64k> oh lol I see what you're doing, 1 sec
[13:07:21] <lexbuck> doug64k Ah ok. I had: href="javascript:void(0)" on the link and it seemed to work so I rolled with it. I'll use prevent default
[13:08:01] <doug64k> lexbuck: http://jsfiddle.net/kotrqjvt/2/
[13:08:14] <doug64k> use that, yours was broken if there were more than 1
[13:08:46] <doug64k> lexbuck: don't use javascript protocol links - utterly obsolete hack that is long past us
[13:11:36] <lexbuck> doug64k Dang, that worked great and I think I actually understand everything you wrote. :) Thanks, won't use the javascript protocol going foreward
[13:11:48] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/kotrqjvt/3/
[13:13:40] <quuxman> doug64k: I know. I solved my problem as I was asking it
[13:13:41] <lexbuck> doug64k Thanks that works great. One thing I hadn't considered was something like this possibly: http://jsfiddle.net/kotrqjvt/4/
[13:13:56] <quuxman> doug64k: but I don't need to set multiple timeouts. That wouldn't help
[13:14:01] <lexbuck> doug64k Where one p tag has text AND a br tag but it seems to work nicely in ONLY removing the p tag that has the <br> tag only
[13:14:52] <decx> i'd check against text().length this === '<br>' business just screams headaches
[13:15:34] <doug64k> yeah, I wouldn't check for <br> if humans are involved with entering it. if it is machine generated and guaranteed to look exactly that way everytime, it can be legitimate
[13:17:11] <doug64k> you could loosen it up by doing html.match(/^\s*<\s*(br)\s*>\s*$/) !== null
[13:18:20] <doug64k>  and tolerate xml quick tag  html.match(/^\s*<\s*(br)\/?\s*>\s*$/) !== null
[13:20:26] <lexbuck> doug64k Yeah, this is a little workaround for something I'm doing with froala editor. By default, the editor places the <p><br></p> into the editor on page load. I'm inserting something into the textarea body when an anchor is clicked and thus want to remove that existing <p> tag to eliminate the extra space above the item I'm inserting. So, basically, there could be a p tag with text and br's but as long as the code only removes <p><br></p> exactly
[13:20:27] <lexbuck>  like that, then I'll be good
[13:22:48] <doug64k> lexbuck: like I mentioned earlier, it is scary to match against an exact string... I'll update the fiddle to match any legitimate html that is just a br
[13:24:30] <doug64k> lexbuck: http://jsfiddle.net/kotrqjvt/6/
[13:25:48] <doug64k> oops http://jsfiddle.net/kotrqjvt/7/
[13:25:51] <lexbuck> doug64k Awesome! Thanks! I guess my confusion with this is that the code you gave me previously worked (or seemed to) just the same as this code. I can't picture a situation when it would have messed up?
[13:26:45] <doug64k> lexbuck: easy: the browser changes the html you stuff into innerHTML somehow
[13:27:04] <doug64k> or some code change in the future adds "harmless" whitespace and now this code breaks
[13:27:22] <doug64k> so better to test for any legal html that is just a br, rather than test for <br>
[13:29:42] <lexbuck> doug64k I apologize, but I don't follow I don't think. Could you add to the fiddle to give me an example of a time when the old code you gave would not work? I'm testing it over here and it works on everything I throw at it. You obviously know more than me, I'm just curious at this point.
[13:30:27] <doug64k> lexbuck: the html could be "     <br>"   or "<br>    "  or "    <br   "  or "   <   br>" etc etc
[13:30:57] <doug64k> lex or even "    <   br   /   >       "
[13:32:49] <doug64k> lexbuck: it's basically a hack right? hard-wired to work with observed current implementation of that editor. well, that editor might change the way those empty p tags work. don't you want your code to have a chance at working in the future if that changes at all?
[13:34:21] <lexbuck> doug64k Ahh... ok. I gotcha. "   <br>" does break the old code and that still works with the new code. I did notice though (and I'm sorry for being a PITA) that the new code doesn't work with: "   < br>" (space after first "<"). I really don't think it will be a big deal, just FYI. wasn't sure if it should remove it with that example.
[13:34:35] <lexbuck> doug64k Yes, good point
[13:40:22] <doug64k> lexbuck: because the browser happened to transform that into &lt   br&gt;    why? who knows?
[13:41:07] <doug64k> lexbuck: if the .html returned <   br>  in some browser, the code would match it
[13:41:49] <lexbuck> doug64k Alright. Thanks a lot. I appreicate it. Learned a lot, actually. :)
[14:16:15] <DubLo7> anyone have any good ideas about why XSS is a bad thing?  My boss wants to just pass every script through "eval" because "what's the worse people could do?" - they can already use developer tools.
[14:16:50] <robertmaxrees> let's say you're google.
[14:16:58] <robertmaxrees> and you have this email system, right?
[14:17:20] <robertmaxrees> you're probably logged in persistently so you don't have to log in every time you go to their site.
[14:17:21] <DubLo7> I can't quite get him to understand why filtering incoming data is a not a Bad Thing.
[14:17:26] <DubLo7> right...
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> if you (google) didn't filter things correctly, any third party can access that email as any logged in user.
[14:18:07] <robertmaxrees> from anywhere.
[14:18:23] <robertmaxrees> i just craft a page with a script that scrapes your inbox and sends it wherever i want.
[14:18:50] <robertmaxrees> the issue isn't YOUR server, it's your end-user's data.
[14:19:22] <Robdgreat> "no skin off my nose, I hate my users"
[14:20:04] <robertmaxrees> DubLo7 also, eval() is terrible for a lot of reasons on top of XSS.  what problem are you trying to solve?
[14:22:18] <DubLo7> My boss wants a system where he can run any code he wants on the browsers of every person who comes to his website, even when they go offline.  He wanted to do javascript bitcoin mining on his "super computer" of client browsers.
[14:22:54] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:23:01] <DubLo7> Basically everything that browsers are designed to preventâ€¦ that's what he wants to do.
[14:23:02] <robertmaxrees> so then just include the JS on the page.
[14:23:31] <treehug88> DubLo7: I think that might be considered 'hacking'
[14:23:56] <robertmaxrees> DubLo7 how does he expect that code to run after the user leaves the site?
[14:24:01] <treehug88> DubLo7: http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/12/new-jersey-slaps-mit-bitcoin-hackers-with-subpoena-and-theyre-fighting-back/
[14:24:10] <DubLo7> treehub88: Yes, code will magically runs in the background while you keep browsing.
[14:24:22] <robertmaxrees> that's illegal.
[14:24:51] <robertmaxrees> and difficult to do for a very good reason.
[14:25:06] <dcherman> DubLo7: so....a botnet?  :/
[14:25:08] <Paradisee> what's wrong with this code? http://dpaste.com/2V1HKBZ i mean, each time a press on the button "lights_on" or "lights_off" everything works, but if i press directly a light it mess up all the json content.....
[14:26:05] <DubLo7> dcherman - that's a part of it.  Otherwise it's just not getting it.  People can change our webpage or submit stuff as users.  Who cares, we have username / passwords so it's not an issue.
[14:26:08] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee nowhere in that code do you have anything related to the specific lights.
[14:26:18] <Paradisee> what do you mean
[14:27:17] <robertmaxrees> exactly what i said.  i see the "lights on" and "lights off", but you said something about pushing directly on a light without providing any context.
[14:27:25] <Paradisee> i have this function for the lights: http://dpaste.com/1KR1DZZ
[14:27:49] <Paradisee> this is the full code: http://dpaste.com/36EZ1KV
[14:27:50] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: ^
[14:29:01] <Paradisee> without the buttons, everything works
[14:29:06] <robertmaxrees> :( why are you dropping the curlies?
[14:29:10] <Paradisee> wut?
[14:29:31] <robertmaxrees> you're missing curly braces all over the place.
[14:29:36] <Paradisee> where
[14:30:01] <robertmaxrees> a bunch of your conditionsals.
[14:30:04] <robertmaxrees> *conditionals
[14:30:14] <Paradisee> its just one line there
[14:30:19] <robertmaxrees> it'll work, but it makes stuff hard to read imo.
[14:30:25] <robertmaxrees> un, lines 20-23 are multiple lines, but OK.
[14:30:36] <DubLo7> â€¦ ok, he's getting it.  We must filter incoming data.  I was just getting frustrated at the sounds silly who cares (about our users) mentality.  He's been talking about an hour.  Thanks everyone.
[14:30:58] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee also, you have no code about editing a specific light as far as I can tell.
[14:31:13] <Paradisee> i have this function for the lights: http://dpaste.com/1KR1DZZ
[14:31:24] <Paradisee> line 79 of the full code
[14:31:31] <robertmaxrees> how does that data relate back to your ajax data?
[14:31:52] <Paradisee> it works..
[14:32:24] <robertmaxrees> lol you're not giving me anything to work with.  not sure how to help you here.  maybe somebody else will be able to figure it out.
[14:32:58] <Paradisee> i gave you all the whole code
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> without any data.  really hard to see how it all relates together.
[14:33:44] <robertmaxrees> also, try to use event delegation, instead of binding click events within each statements.
[14:33:58] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/2DYERBZ
[14:34:25] <Paradisee> as i said, if i click on lights_on, or lights_off
[14:34:27] <Paradisee> it works...
[14:34:59] <Paradisee> but if i press one of those 2, and then i click on a single light, then json will mess up
[14:35:07] <robertmaxrees> how does it "mess up"?
[14:35:12] <Paradisee> i dont know?
[14:35:22] <robertmaxrees> how do you know it "messes up", then?
[14:35:29] <Paradisee> i makes some light on and some other off
[14:35:37] <Paradisee> if i put each light on
[14:35:54] <Paradisee> and click on a single one, ill have all the json wrong
[14:36:03] <Paradisee> means, some lights on, some off...
[14:36:08] <Paradisee> no logic behind
[14:36:24] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what's broken for you.
[14:36:27] <robertmaxrees> good luck though.
[14:36:32] <Paradisee> :/
[14:37:36] <robertmaxrees> it'd be great if you could mock this all up in a fiddle.
[14:37:44] <robertmaxrees> but something tells you you'll say you can't do that.
[14:38:06] <Paradisee> exactly
[14:39:33] <Paradisee> is there a way to know when an ajax call has finished the process?
[14:39:48] <robertmaxrees> .done() for success
[14:39:52] <robertmaxrees> .fail() for errors.
[14:39:58] <robertmaxrees> .complete() for either/or.
[14:40:22] <Paradisee> i have.done should work
[14:41:18] <robertmaxrees> also, those event bindings will run every time your code comes back.
[14:41:32] <robertmaxrees> looks like you'll get duplicate bindings on the same element.
[14:42:26] <Paradisee> why?
[14:42:30] <Paradisee> i just load them once
[14:42:42] <robertmaxrees> does that ajax ever run more than once?
[14:43:24] <Paradisee> i have one ayax call to load each element, then binded ajax calls to each request
[14:44:00] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it's not working the way you think it is.
[14:44:08] <Paradisee> probably :/
[14:44:12] <robertmaxrees> putting event bindings inside enumerators is never a good ide.a
[14:44:19] <robertmaxrees> this is why you should use event delegation.
[14:44:32] <Paradisee> i don't know how to use them :/
[14:44:37] <Paradisee> never done before
[14:44:47] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[14:44:56] <Paradisee> its arabic for me
[14:45:23] <robertmaxrees> give a common class to all the things you want to activate the handler, and stick parent on something that exists on pageload that's an ancestor of the stuff you care about.
[14:45:36] <robertmaxrees> you could even use the document if you really wanted, though I'd avoid that if you could.
[14:46:11] <Paradisee> this is the code i have when i load the page: http://dpaste.com/2G2QCDM
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> the html.
[14:46:41] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for .on() for more info.
[14:46:47] <Paradisee> basically, it reads the json file, makes images and an event on it
[14:46:51] <Paradisee> ok
[14:54:36] <Paradisee> is there a way to get the id of the clicked element?
[14:54:45] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('id');
[14:56:39] <Paradisee> mm
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> if you're using event delegation, do your binding outside of the each btw.
[14:57:29] <codecutter> Perhaps this is quite common question. When the page is half away down and a modal is displayed using 'append' the content seem to appear off the screen becuase of the scroll, is there a way to enrure the content is position on the visible area of the doc?
[14:57:49] <codecutter> ensure*
[14:57:52] <robertmaxrees> use position: fixed; on the element.
[14:58:33] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees:
[14:58:33] <Paradisee>     $('.temp').click(function() {
[14:58:33] <Paradisee>         console.log($(this).prop('id'));
[14:58:33] <Paradisee>     });
[14:58:44] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee do not do multiline pastes.
[14:58:54] <robertmaxrees> and that will not work for anything added after pageload with that class.
[14:59:01] <Paradisee> $('.temp').click(function() { console.log($(this).prop('id')); });
[14:59:11] <codecutter> then the element will always be fixed, page is response
[14:59:17] <codecutter> responsive*
[14:59:19] <robertmaxrees> this is why you should use event delegation instead, Paradisee
[14:59:34] <robertmaxrees> codecutter head on over to #css, they might be able to help you mnore.
[14:59:41] <Paradisee> i still have no idea how to implement that
[14:59:47] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee i gave you an example earlier.
[15:00:04] <Paradisee> i know, but its not clear
[15:00:21] <robertmaxrees> then say that instead of totally skirting my suggestion, yo.
[15:00:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bgtjdq11/
[15:00:52] <robertmaxrees> see that last example?  the one with "do this"?
[15:01:25] <Paradisee> ya
[15:01:38] <robertmaxrees> that's how you do it.
[15:02:09] <robertmaxrees> replace the 'div' with the element you're appending your stuff to.
[15:02:22] <robertmaxrees> and the 'a' with the class for the elements you were selecting before.
[15:04:53] <Paradisee> nothing..
[15:07:12] <robertmaxrees> we've pointed out to you before that giving us a generic answer like that without showing us your code or telling us the specific error doesn't help up.
[15:07:22] <robertmaxrees> *us
[15:08:03] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: isnt easy to exaplain something that can be only watched
[15:08:11] <robertmaxrees> show us the code you came up with.
[15:08:30] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/1WYF16F
[15:08:42] <robertmaxrees> outside of the each dude
[15:08:46] <robertmaxrees> i said this earlier.
[15:09:14] <robertmaxrees> stick that new stuff before your send_data delcataion.
[15:09:17] <Paradisee> outside i can't get the value
[15:09:36] <robertmaxrees> that's why you give them alkl a shared class.
[15:09:43] <robertmaxrees> because what you have no literally doesn't make any sense.
[15:09:51] <robertmaxrees> use the .temp class.
[15:10:24] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to get another way to get/set your props on the images, but you could do that with data attributes or whatever.
[15:15:17] <Paradisee> $('.temp').click(function() { alert('hey'); });
[15:15:22] <Paradisee> doesnt work aswell :/
[15:15:31] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening.
[15:15:44] <robertmaxrees> hopefully somebody else comes along as is able to help.
[15:15:45] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[15:16:07] <Paradisee> it should work robertmaxrees
[15:16:09] <Paradisee> but it doesnt
[15:16:15] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[15:16:27] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/2EFA56X
[15:17:23] <robertmaxrees> because that click binding runs before the ajax completes.
[15:17:40] <robertmaxrees> $('#container_map').on('click', '.temp', function() {console.log(});
[15:18:07] <robertmaxrees> woops i mean $('#container_map').on('click', '.temp', function() {console.log('here') }); <- this instead of your current line 84
[15:18:07] <Paradisee> gh
[15:18:16] <Paradisee> this works
[15:18:27] <robertmaxrees> the one I gave you?
[15:18:30] <Paradisee> ya
[15:18:39] <Paradisee> js sux :D
[15:18:43] <robertmaxrees> no at all.
[15:19:05] <Paradisee> its an implicit programming language
[15:19:10] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[15:19:15] <robertmaxrees> i do functional coding with it all the time.
[15:19:44] <robertmaxrees> and i see fairly successful OO with it, too, though I don't like that personally.
[15:21:36] <Paradisee> btw, now with this example i understood the problem...
[15:21:45] <Paradisee> but gotta work on it to let it work..
[15:21:51] <Paradisee> and i still have no idea how to fix it :/
[15:41:17] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: http://dpaste.com/29BF1XT
[15:41:20] <Paradisee> what do you think ?
[15:41:22] <Paradisee> it works
[16:48:54] <cYmen> Is it possible that $.ajax({... works for loading json data from local files?
[16:49:09] <cYmen> I mean it seems to work but somehow I expected it not to. :)
[16:49:22] <robertmaxrees> mind clarifying?
[16:50:51] <cYmen> I assumed that it would try to talk http to a server...which I do not have, just a .html and a .json file.
[16:51:12] <robertmaxrees> depending on what all you're doing, that might work.
[16:51:23] <robertmaxrees> but that'd never work on a real world website.
[16:51:24] <digital-ghost> Hey, does anyone know what the numerical representation of "fast" is for .fadeIn("fast")
[16:51:37] <digital-ghost> I see the 'default' for the method says 400, but I can't figure out the above question.
[16:52:12] <digital-ghost> Actually, sratch that. Needed to scroll down further, looks like 200 is fast.
[16:52:18] <cYmen> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to build a single page app to be used locally. Does it work reliably in this case?
[16:52:28] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:52:36] <cYmen> Why not?
[16:53:11] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you turned a security setting off to me.
[16:53:20] <cYmen> hm
[16:55:13] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[16:55:54] <cYmen> Just a little data visualizer...
[16:56:02] <cYmen> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40787
[16:56:06] <cYmen> Apprently you're right.
[16:56:14] <robertmaxrees> why not just link directly to the file in question?
[16:56:24] <robertmaxrees> why use ajax?
[16:56:39] <cYmen> robertmaxrees: I want to re-read the file every few seconds.
[16:56:51] <cYmen> The data is generated by a desktop app and changes regularly.
[16:56:54] <robertmaxrees> JSONP imo.
[16:57:09] <cYmen> jsonp? :)
[16:57:13] <robertmaxrees> wrap the whole thing in a function call to the thing you want to run.
[16:57:47] <robertmaxrees> use an interval Timer to set the src prop of a script tag and see if that works.
[16:57:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise - just setup a simple local webserver.
[16:58:21] <cYmen> Or just make it firefox only. Xp
[17:01:13] <cYmen> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the jsonp suggestion!
[19:41:20] <xananax> Hello, I'm trying to build a one-pager with four sliders, each with many (20~30) large images in it. Performance is acceptable, but on mobile, it is not really. I've tried CSS3 animations (HD-accelerated), using different animation frameworks, loading the images on demand, lazily,...Nothing really worked.
[19:41:49] <xananax> Any recommendation for handling such a case? Large number of large images in sliders?
[20:01:21] <__joshua__> xananax: define performance
[20:01:30] <__joshua__> scrolling performance?
[20:02:04] <xananax> __joshua__: yes, images stutter when sliding, and on low-end devices, everything is slighlty unresponsive
[20:02:22] <__joshua__> how large are the images?
[20:03:28] <__joshua__> and does the slider show one at a time (for a maximum of 2 during a slide)
[20:03:39] <bkboggy> i am having problems with draggable items stacking on top of each other in a sortable if dragged/dropped too quickly: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26600175/draggable-items-stack-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-sortable
[20:03:51] <bkboggy> anyone knows how to prevent it?  (included link for clarification and pictures)
[20:04:07] <__joshua__> can you make a jsfiddle, bkboggy?
[20:04:14] <bkboggy> i'll try
[20:04:15] <bkboggy> brb
[20:04:51] <xananax> __joshua__: the largest that facebook provides me with, depending
[20:05:10] <xananax> It's often around 1200xsomething
[20:05:50] <__joshua__> right, so far bigger than needed
[20:07:37] <xananax> __joshua__: but this is a serverless static page that pulls content from social media. I can't resize the images
[20:08:00] <__joshua__> well you could
[20:08:24] <__joshua__> not sure if it would help, until we know if the large image size is the cause of the performance issues
[20:08:35] <__joshua__> is it using native scrolling or some js hack?
[20:09:26] <xananax> It's using CSS3 animations right now (translate). I tried using various libraries, but it didn't change much
[20:11:05] <bkboggy> __joshua__: Hmm, I pasted all the relevant code, but the result is not exactly workable, not sure what I'm dong wrong there: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=1xS51TkstN   SO post has the picture of the output
[20:11:54] <bkboggy> basically, the issue is that if i drag things too quickly, the end up stacking on top of each other in the list
[20:11:54] <__joshua__> xananax:  you are translating Y/X instead of scrolling?
[20:13:52] <xananax> __joshua__: depends, I was keeping all the images on absolute positioning outside of my container, and sliding the selected image from the right. Now I'm using dragdealer.js. Before that I tried velocity.js. In all cases, performance was fairly similar. I felt a small gain with dragdealer
[20:14:16] <xananax> dragdealer uses CSS3 translation by default, falling back on scrolling
[20:15:55] <__joshua__> im speculating here, but I think its the image size.  if you have 4 * 20 * ~1MB images you will probably run into issues on mobile.  have you tried this set up with scaled images?  (either source more images or use a canvas bilinear interpolation function)
[20:17:41] <xananax> __joshua__: I'm going to try canvas. It might be a good idea
[20:18:24] <xananax> __joshua__: but if I'm loading the image in order to write it to te canvas, isn't it in memory anyway?
[20:18:49] <__joshua__> unto you delete the reference to it
[20:19:07] <__joshua__> then the gc can get it
[20:19:51] <xananax> __joshua__: ok, because AFAIK, dom elements are never GC'ed. But maybe a JS dom element that is never appended to the document is, that's what you're saying, right?
[20:21:45] <__joshua__> if you load it with var i = new Image(path).  i.load(function(){ downsamplecanvas() });
[20:23:37] <__joshua__> xananax: and im not positive, but im pretty sure if you clean up your dom references they will be gc'd by a modern browser
[20:25:01] <bkboggy> any ideas what went wrong in my case, guys?
[20:30:51] <__joshua__> no, unless you can make a demo of it
[20:31:04] <bkboggy> i posted the fiddler link
[20:31:14] <bkboggy> but for some reason jquery-ui is not taking affect
[20:31:35] <bkboggy> SO post has screenshots of good state and bad state
[20:31:56] <__joshua__> did you import jquery ui?
[20:32:08] <bkboggy> in fiddler? i just selected it
[20:32:10] <bkboggy> on the left side
[20:32:30] <bkboggy> do i need to import it from external resources?
[20:32:44] <__joshua__> can you please post again, your link doesnt work (and dont do collaborate)
[20:33:00] <bkboggy> are you giraffe?
[20:33:07] <bkboggy> or is that someone else
[20:33:13] <__joshua__> someone else
[20:33:17] <bkboggy> oh
[20:33:43] <__joshua__> just post the jsfiddle url if you want me to have a look
[20:33:53] <bkboggy> how would i post a link if it's not from collaboration menu
[20:34:01] <__joshua__> save
[20:34:04] <bkboggy> ah right on
[20:34:05] <__joshua__> then send me the url
[20:34:07] <bkboggy> http://jsfiddle.net/8cj643hz/
[20:34:10] <bkboggy> thanks
[20:35:12] <bkboggy> i'm using jquery 1.11.1 and jquery-ui 1.11.2
[20:35:36] <__joshua__> is that jsfiddle working for you?
[20:35:43] <bkboggy> no
[20:35:47] <bkboggy> groups have no styles
[20:35:54] <bkboggy> or jquery wrap
[20:36:11] <__joshua__> and you get 55 errors?
[20:36:17] <bkboggy> no, no errors
[20:37:31] <bkboggy> i just see two lists as boxes with titles Group 1 and Group 2 with items inside, but no style applied or jquery taking affect, not sure what's going on there
[20:37:32] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/6120/
[20:37:46] <bkboggy> oh
[20:37:51] <bkboggy> external resources
[20:37:52] <bkboggy> gotcha
[20:37:56] <bkboggy> i thought fiddle would include them
[20:38:12] <bkboggy> but yeah
[20:38:19] <bkboggy> so, if you drag and drop those items quickly
[20:38:22] <bkboggy> notice how they stack once in a while
[20:38:25] <bkboggy> leaving white space
[20:38:28] <bkboggy> within the list
[20:41:51] <__joshua__> curious
[20:42:31] <bkboggy> yeah.... first week in web dev and i get hit with that
[20:43:35] <xananax> __joshua__: yup, my knowledge is old. Modern browsers do clean up dom elements. But it's fairly recent
[21:11:58] <bkboggy> __joshua__: any luck?
[21:27:58] <bkboggy> does anyone know how to prevent droppables from stacking on top of each other and creating empty space in their sortable lists when dragged and dropped too quickly? http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/6123/
[21:28:21] <ragas> how could i load a portion of a page, like using .load, but i want to pick links out of "target.html" rather than loading the whole thing.
[21:29:17] <ragas> sorry, ill rtfm more.
[21:33:41] <P0rk> If I am using label elements wrapped around hidden input:radio elements , where or how or what happened to the focus event?
[21:34:47] <doug64k> bkboggy: yeah, it's bad
[21:35:03] <bkboggy> doug64k: which part, my code or the bug
[21:36:46] <doug64k> drag 1 onto 4, then drag the 4
[21:36:48] <bkboggy> i notice that after i re-arrange items, they start behaving oddly
[21:36:53] <doug64k> that glitch?
[21:37:18] <bkboggy> there are a few gtliches
[21:37:33] <bkboggy> one of them... if you start moving items quickly and dropping them, empty space is created and they stack
[21:37:44] <bkboggy> i've no idea what the hell is going
[21:37:49] <doug64k> a specific repro helps
[21:38:13] <doug64k> helps avoid "ain't workin" problem descriptions :D
[21:38:27] <bkboggy> repro?
[21:38:45] <bkboggy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26600175/draggable-items-stack-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-sortable
[21:38:46] <doug64k> reproduction - i.e. reproduce the problem
[21:38:51] <bkboggy> i show images
[21:38:54] <bkboggy> in that so post
[21:38:57] <bkboggy> of the problem
[21:38:59] <doug64k> your code looks right, you are doing the simplest thing
[21:39:18] <doug64k> I updated it so the items have positioned parents http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/6124/
[21:39:27] <doug64k> I thought it was going to help but it didn't
[21:39:56] <bkboggy> i might have just fixed it... hmm
[21:40:08] <bkboggy> sec
[21:41:54] <doug64k> have you dragged each item from the left to the right? what's going on there?
[21:42:19] <bkboggy> interesting: i looked in console and it's throwing this exception: http://pastebin.com/M5q9pz4B
[21:42:36] <bkboggy> doesn't matter, from one list to another or within the same list
[21:42:41] <bkboggy> if items get moved too quickly
[21:42:42] <bkboggy> error occurs
[21:42:55] <bkboggy> i just fixed it by remove revert from sortable
[21:42:57] <doug64k> I think I can agree that it is a jquery ui bug
[21:42:58] <bkboggy> i think
[21:43:05] <bkboggy> removing*
[21:43:10] <doug64k> your test case is too simple for it to be your fault
[21:44:13] <bkboggy> i think i fixed it... works fine in my browser: http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/6125/   Fiddle still has odd behavior once in a while... but w/e
[21:44:24] <bkboggy> not sure why revert was an issue, i'm going to have to read through that exception
[21:45:01] <bkboggy> seems some sort of dispatch issue... maybe jquery-ui code
[21:45:40] <bkboggy> but yeah... two days later, and it was just one damn line of code
[21:45:41] <bkboggy> lol
[21:46:03] <bkboggy> thanks for giving me a hand, doug
[21:46:12] <doug64k> I spammed around and got spurious "this.helper is null" exceptions
[21:46:17] <doug64k> np
[21:46:28] <bkboggy> yeah, similar to what i was getting
[21:46:49] <doug64k> obvious that the jq ui drag isn't bulletproof while animating
[21:46:56] <bkboggy> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of null jquery-ui.js:5679$.widget._clear and so on
[21:47:02] <doug64k> if you set the animation to instant it might be a workaround
[21:47:10] <bkboggy> hmm
[21:47:25] <bkboggy>  i do like the animation, but that revert removal did the trick
[21:47:45] <bkboggy> there's already revert on draggable, so i don't really need the sortable to have it
[21:48:42] <bkboggy> i'll probably drop jquery-ui guys a note about this, see what they think
[21:48:51] <doug64k> good idea
[22:04:29] <ragas> this looks right to me: $('#object1').load(sem.attr("href a"));  // load links from target page, doesnt work.  but this does load the whole page:$('#object1').load(sem.attr("href"));
[22:06:08] <jphase> ragas: .load in that usage will load a remote page into the selector you use before it - so you'll need to pass a URL in .load
[22:06:32] <jphase> 'href a' as a selector means <href><a></a></href>  which isn't valid
[22:07:40] <jphase> perhaps you meant   sem.attr('href')   will pull the href attribute from a jQuery DOM object set to the variable 'sem' in that case
[22:09:28] <ragas> thats what i have done. sem,attr("href") holds the address, and the A is a selector for that page
[22:12:39] <jphase> ragas: then that's what you want.  .attr('href a') doesn't make sense.  sem.attr('href') would make sense if "sem" is an <a></a> tag with an href attribute. just use that
[22:12:43] <ThomasCrown> I am trying to post variables into my database. I am getting these variables from my html input type: textbox.
[22:12:44] <ThomasCrown> I can't seem to get them, can someone help me out with the code below of what it should be?
[22:12:44] <ThomasCrown> $.post('./script/delete_event_datetime.php',
[22:12:44] <ThomasCrown> {
[22:12:44] <ThomasCrown> date: $('#p_date_' + id).val(),
[22:12:44] <ThomasCrown> time: $('#p_time_' + id).val(),
[22:12:47] <ThomasCrown> },
[22:13:03] <jphase> ThomasCrown: whoa buddy.... use hastebin.com or something, no multiline code samples pls
[22:14:22] <jphase> ThomasCrown: have you checked your network tab in dev tools to see the post variables sending to your php script? and does the response from your php script look good?
[22:15:23] <ThomasCrown> Ya I have setup alerts in the post page and they always come up empty
[22:15:24] <jphase> also, just by the looks of it there's really no security in that - anyone could post to that script and delete events... just sayin' ;)
[22:15:45] <ThomasCrown> I have security at the top of the page that checks for auth before it's ran.
[22:15:49] <jphase> okay
[22:15:54] <ThomasCrown> but thanks for looking out for me :)
[22:15:56] <jphase> ThomasCrown: don't use alerts, use your network tab. are you familiar?
[22:16:02] <ThomasCrown> F12
[22:16:17] <jphase> sure. and the network tab response is completely empty?
[22:16:47] <P0rk> how do you trigger a focus event on an hidden input element when using it's label to show state?
[22:17:09] <jphase> P0rk: I don't believe you can focus on hidden inputs
[22:17:25] <ThomasCrown> the page is being called as it should.
[22:17:33] <jphase> you could, however, scroll the document to a visible element above where that element is P0rk?
[22:17:38] <jphase> ThomasCrown: on the function that receives your $_POST in PHP, die('test'); at the top of it and test to see if you're even hitting that function.
[22:18:49] <P0rk> I am trying to avoid using select elements because they suck. So, when a field in my form is "active", I want 5 labels (with hidden radiobutton/checkboxes) to be displayed.
[22:19:10] <P0rk> so when one is clicked, it's on to the next field...but how?
[22:19:45] <ThomasCrown> jphase: i am not quite sure what your asking
[22:20:06] <P0rk> almost got a fiddle for ya.
[22:20:12] <ThomasCrown> jphase: really just getting my feet wet with this.
[22:20:49] <jphase> P0rk: it sounds like you want to bind to the radio events... either $('#my_radio').on('change', function() { // use .animate() and/or .fadeToggle here to show next section and scroll to it });  or alternatively you can use .on('input', function(){   as well depending on what you're doing
[22:22:10] <jphase> ThomasCrown: so in PHP you'll need a function in the file: './script/delete_event_datetime.php'  <--- at the top of that file there should be a handler (something like... if ( ! empty( $_POST ) ) { // do something here }   <--- inside that function do something like die('test');
[22:22:30] <jphase> that should allow you to check your network tab to see if in the "reponse" tab of the network section you see "test"
[22:22:37] <jphase> which means jQuery is communicating with PHP
[22:22:44] <ThomasCrown> gotcha.
[22:22:49] <ThomasCrown> testing it now.
[22:23:44] <jphase> ThomasCrown: BTW - if that file does anything like displaying HTML, you'll want to die() with your response so jQuery doesn't get back a bunch of HTML - even if your response is like... die('0'); or die('1'); for success or fail
[22:24:01] <jphase> if the file is solely to handle your AJAX, then no need to worry about that
[22:24:13] <ragas> $( "#b" ).load( "article.html #target" );   == $( "#b" ).load( "foo.attr('href') #target" );  pleaase show me the folly of my syntax   I want to select links FROM the target page
[22:24:38] <jphase> ragas: don't use "" in the second one firstly
[22:24:43] <ragas> but the target is not #target, its A
[22:25:01] <jphase> .load( foo.attr('href') + ' #target' )  <--- something like that perhaps
[22:25:23] <jphase> hmm, so it's an anchor tag?
[22:25:47] <ragas> I tried that.  yeah, im trying to load links from the second page
[22:26:04] <ThomasCrown> jphase: I got an alert back.
[22:26:05] <jphase> oh, well if you need all links, then just use ' a'
[22:26:09] <ThomasCrown> that said test
[22:26:15] <jphase> ragas: .load( foo.attr('href') + ' a' )
[22:26:53] <jphase> ThomasCrown: excellent. now you just need to code your PHP function/whatever to deliver data to jQuery, and then use the callback function on .post() to handle it
[22:27:24] <jphase> $.post('yourfile.php', { data: 'something' }, function( response ) { // do something with response });
[22:27:57] <ThomasCrown> that is what I have.
[22:28:13] <ThomasCrown> but I am trying to get variables in there from the html inputs
[22:28:34] <jphase> ThomasCrown: so in PHP, often times you'll use something like:   die( json_encode( $some_array_or_object ) );   and in jQuery you can use something like   response = $.parseJSON( response );     and then check to see if you can use it, then use it
[22:28:46] <ThomasCrown> k.
[22:28:46] <ragas> aha!  .load( foo.attr('href') + ' a' )   The space is key.
[22:29:14] <jphase> ragas: yeah... so .load('google.com #some_id')   <--- same thing, but with a variable
[22:29:20] <jphase> if there's no space then it won't work
[22:29:47] <jphase> just like .blah.foobar    is an element with both "blah" and "foobar" as a class instead of "blah" class with "foobar" class as a child
[22:29:48] <ragas> thanks jphase!
[22:29:51] <jphase> np
[22:32:10] <ragas> ive been annoyed with sites that make you load 3 pages to get to the page you need.  This is a hack/plugin/learning project.
[22:32:39] <jphase> heh, I recently did a node.js project that scrapes sites and recurses through pagination links... I feel your pain :P
[22:33:04] <jphase> i.e. "click next page link on craigslist and search for toyota trucks that are $500 or less and email me when they appear"
[22:36:08] <ragas> nice!  I'm not ready for node yet &)
[22:36:54] <jphase> well whenever you need to scrape a site that doesn't allow remote AJAX requests like you're doing, you'll either need a proxy or a server-side app hehe
[22:42:20] <ragas> i did something like that with a perl script years ago, but very basic.  just pulled together CL help wanted listings from several different pages.  though it took them 10 years to implement my idea :/
[22:43:29] <jphase> ragas: hah - that was my same background. perl *used* to be that common method of doing that. node.js has made it a bit easier these days.
[22:44:24] <jphase> I'm sure you remember how big those scripts used to get... this was my basic non-polished implementation in node:  https://github.com/jphase/botscrape-restify/blob/master/server.js
[22:44:34] <jphase> much shorter :|
[22:49:53] <ThomasCrown> jphase
[22:50:20] <ThomasCrown> is my code correct for geting a variable from a input type: textbox?
[22:50:49] <ThomasCrown> var v_date = $('p_date_' + id).val());
[22:51:09] <ThomasCrown> id is incrementing
[22:51:40] <jphase> ThomasCrown: .val() should work for all form inputs
[22:51:45] <jphase> however
[22:51:46] <P0rk> ragas, for a while there, compiling CL results programmatically was a crime. I had to defend a kid being sued by CL for "cleaning up" the ugly-ass CL interface.
[22:51:56] <jphase> that means you're looking for a tag <p_date_#>
[22:52:07] <jphase> instead of a tag like... <div id="p_date_#"></div>
[22:52:19] <jphase> put a # or . in front perhaps? to select by id or class?
[22:53:28] <ThomasCrown> var v_date = $('#p_date_' + id).val());
[22:53:53] <ThomasCrown> '#p_date_"+id is my id that want to pull the value from.
[22:54:14] <ragas> heh, P0rk - that kid was prolly getting more 'hits' than i was.  I was just growing it for personal use %)
[22:54:17] <ThomasCrown> do i have to call anything before it to have it look through the document?
[22:55:25] <jphase> ThomasCrown: if you select by id (with # in front) then if you do your HTML correctly (there should NEVER be more than one occurrence of the same id) you shouldn't have to, no
[22:55:52] <jphase> $('#something') will select any element/HTML tag with id="something" (even though there should only be one, ever - since it's an id)
[22:56:09] <jphase> otherwise it'd be a class, in which case I'd recommend using a parent selector before it like...
[22:56:26] <jphase> $('#some-container .someclass')   or something similar
[22:57:10] <ThomasCrown> thank you jphase!
[22:57:17] <jphase> np
[22:58:59] <ragas> open LIST,"/usr/local/bin/lynx -source $listing|" or die "...  $!"   .  Gotta love a language that has "or DIE" as part of its syntax.
[22:59:37] <jphase> ahh semantic white space ftl
[23:47:56] <norc_> Hi. I want to dynamically hide a column of a table. Only way to identify the column, is that the TDs in that column have a class "Foo". Can someone point me in the right direction how to approach this?
[23:48:42] <jphase> norc_: $('td.Foo').hide();
[23:48:52] <jphase> (i think)
[23:49:02] <jphase> I never "hide" table columns though so idk
[23:50:21] <norc_> jphase: that doesn't hide the table header
[23:50:27] <norc_> of that column
[23:51:40] <jphase> $('th:eq(' + $('td.Foo').index() + '), td.Foo').hide();   perhaps?
[23:53:02] <norc_> jphase: nope
[23:53:56] <norc_> Or wait, I think I get the idea.
[23:54:14] <jphase> yeah, that may be off by a number or something
[23:55:55] <jphase> yeah that actually works:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/pvvx0yot/
[23:56:01] <jphase> @ norc_ ^
[23:59:44] <norc_> jphase: Would that only apply to the first matched th?
