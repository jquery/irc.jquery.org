[00:01:42] <karn> thanks
[00:05:33] <arielserafini> karn: though if you're looking for a new theme, tomorrow is great: https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme
[00:07:03] <karn> arielserafini; thanks, I will check it out.
[00:14:59] <MrTrick> I can't figure out how to use the .ajaxComplete, .ajaxSend global handlers - is anyone familiar with them?
[00:15:47] <MrTrick> The runtime fails on `$.ajaxComplete( ... )` , is it meant to be $('body').ajaxComplete( ... ) or something?
[00:18:07] <MrTrick> $(document), I see. Might be nice if the docs said that.
[00:21:31] <Cork> MrTrick: it should work on any element on the page
[00:22:00] <Cork> actually it should work on any object that you can keep referring
[00:22:17] <jarr0dsz> hi guys is there a way to detect a "page reload" ? i have several functions im calling
[00:22:21] <MrTrick> not sure what I was doing wrong, then.
[00:22:27] <Cork> var myHandleObject = {}; $(myHandleObject).ajaxComplete( ... )
[00:22:27] <jarr0dsz> but page reloads or browsing from page to page breaks this
[00:22:51] <Cork> jarr0dsz: no, you can't
[00:22:54] <jarr0dsz> so i have this problem managing these functions in my code
[00:23:08] <Cork> you can catch unload and load, but thats it
[00:23:15] <Cork> (and beforeunload)
[00:23:19] <jarr0dsz> i have this very extreme frustrating setup with timeslots... say on time X function start is called and on time Y function scoreboard is called
[00:24:13] <pingec> Is there a selector that will partially match by attribute name? I would like to get all elements that have an attribute that matches the pattern "data-j*"
[00:24:27] <amccloud> Say I have $('.test') how do I get the surrounding children? Say I want 5 before and 5 after .test.
[00:24:48] <Cork> uh surrounding children?
[00:24:52] <Cork> you mean siblings?
[00:24:58] <Cork> a child can't be around the parent
[00:25:00] <amccloud> yea sorry. sublings*
[00:25:34] <Cork> ?.next
[00:25:35] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[00:25:40] <Cork> ?.prev
[00:25:41] <bot-t> .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[00:25:55] <Cork> amccloud: if you want all siblings see ?.siblings
[00:25:56] <bot-t> amccloud, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[00:26:01] <MrTrick> I need to encode some query params. ( foo=bar&this=that.... ) Is there a built-in jquery or js thing to make that easier?
[00:26:15] <Cork> MrNibbles: for an ajax call?
[00:26:43] <MrTrick> yes, but not in the URL.
[00:26:51] * MrTrick is abusing other parts of the API.
[00:27:08] <amccloud> Cork: but how do I get the next 5 only?
[00:27:14] <Cork> MrTrick: if you want to do ex an ajax post just put an object in the ajax data section
[00:27:20] <MrTrick> but basically, to convert from Map -> param string
[00:27:27] <Cork> { foo: 'bar', this: 'that' }
[00:27:39] <Cork> MrTrick: javascript doens't have maps
[00:27:50] <MrTrick> Yes, not in the proper sense, I know.
[00:27:56] <MrTrick> not in the data section either. Actually, in the Authorization header.
[00:28:07] <Cork> ah
[00:28:10] <Cork> ?.param
[00:28:10] <bot-t> jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[00:28:17] <MrTrick> cheers.
[00:28:42] <agaba> is there a way to remove certain tags from the elements contents?
[00:28:53] <agaba> and I mean tags and their content
[00:33:11] <noregret> is there any method/addon to use that can take a list of dates using the format "2012-08-09 15:59:38" and get me the most recent one ?
[00:34:01] <Ravindran> agaba: you can use $.remove method . it remove tag, child elements and associated jquery events
[00:34:31] <agaba> Ravindran: nice, thanks!
[00:35:37] <MrTrick> Okay, new problem; in a $.ajaxSend, handler, how can I fetch the actual URL the request will be sent to? It doesn't seem to be in the xhr object.
[00:36:51] <Ravindran> noregret: I don't know any. But you can convert the string to Date object and use getTime to convert to millesecond since 1070. You can compare the milliseconds now to identify the recent one. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[00:38:41] <MrTrick> durr, it's in the third argument, which I'd forgotten about.
[00:39:01] <noregret> hmm, is there a sort method that can sort that list, it will simple that way i guess
[00:39:04] <noregret> Ravindran: ^
[00:41:27] <Ravindran> noregret: AFAKI, no. you can google it
[00:45:43] <koosha> how can I load contents dynamically into an element and still update address bar(history)?
[00:45:58] <koosha> I found load() but it doesn't update history
[00:47:26] <Ravindran> koosha: you should use one of ajax browser history library/plug-in
[00:48:05] <koosha> Ravindran: could you please give me what function/
[00:48:07] <koosha> ?
[00:48:49] <Ravindran> koosha: check this out http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/ . It's a good library
[00:54:40] <agaba> does prependTo delete the source?
[00:59:44] <agaba> val.prependTo('#commercial'); works like a charm but val.clone().prependTo('#commercial'); doesn't
[01:03:32] <faraway> agaba: it does not delete but it moves the element, and what does not work with clone().prependTo
[01:04:16] <agaba> clone() does not place anything to #commercial
[01:04:28] <agaba> agaba: ^

[01:11:30] <Cork> what on earth did that have to do with jquery...
[01:11:45] <NodeX> lol
[01:22:19] <sbl> Hello
[01:22:58] <sbl> how can i create array for everyone element with class="area" ?
[01:23:25] <sbl> for example, isset 4 elements with class="area" and I want to create 4 arrays for these elements
[01:23:50] <sbl> <div class="area" id="area-1"></div> <div class="area" id="area-2"></div> etc.
[01:24:03] <Phil-Work> $('.area')
[01:24:30] <sbl> Phil-Work: yes but it just make object
[01:24:31] <koosha> does $('a').click work for all links?
[01:24:45] <Phil-Work> koosha, yes
[01:24:48] <Phil-Work> sbl, is this an issue?
[01:24:58] <Phil-Work> arrays in Javascript are very limited in comparison
[01:25:14] <faraway> sbl: jquery result is an array like object
[01:25:18] <sbl> I want to dynamically create arrays for items with class = "area"
[01:25:27] <Phil-Work> sbl, arrays of what?
[01:25:40] <agaba> faraway: http://pastebin.com/qtmLNFGu
[01:25:43] <sbl> just arrays, I will put into some data
[01:25:47] <agaba> faraway: works without the clone()
[01:25:56] <sbl> array_area_1 = []; array_area_2 = []; etc
[01:26:03] <agaba> faraway: but when clone() included it won't prepend anything
[01:26:14] <Phil-Work> sbl, that doesn't make a lot of sense semantically
[01:26:16] <koosha> Phil-Work: then what should I set href attribute to?
[01:26:33] <Phil-Work> koosha, depends what you're trying to acheive
[01:26:51] <Phil-Work> for non-JS compatability, it should be the target page
[01:26:59] <koosha> Phil-Work: I want to load dynamic contents into a div elem and update my history
[01:27:06] <Phil-Work> if the click function returns false, the browser won't follow the link
[01:27:09] <koosha> we a back button support
[01:27:18] <koosha> with*
[01:27:36] <nFFF> sbl,  $('.area').each(function(i) { var arr+i = [ $(this) ]; });
[01:27:55] <Phil-Work> koosha, if you're not bothered about degrading for non-JS browsers, set the href to #
[01:28:14] <Phil-Work> if you are, set it to where you want users who don't support JS to go
[01:28:45] <faraway> agaba: do you get the node form the iframes document and add it to the document that contains the iframes ?
[01:29:23] <Phil-Work> sbl, it still seems silly
[01:29:33] <Phil-Work> you can set arbitrary data on the jquery objects that come back from the selector
[01:29:34] <agaba> faraway: I'm getting portion of the iframe's content and want to copy that to two different places within certain DIVs
[01:30:22] <koosha> Phil-Work: Please give me some advice. I want to load dynamic content into an div elem and update history (back-button)
[01:30:26] <sbl> I'm gonna explain what I mean, ok?
[01:30:31] <koosha> this is just a simple and test app
[01:30:36] <koosha> what should I do?
[01:30:47] <koosha> load() doesn't update history
[01:32:31] <sbl> I have couple elements with .area (table with 2 columns [in plus] and [in minus]. And element have haystack words "look good, romantic, arogant" etc (drag and drop to table). I must make individual arrays for results.
[01:33:30] <faraway> agaba: 'object' is out of the conent of the iframe, #commercial  is on that page itselfe and not inside of the iframe ... right ?
[01:33:51] <sbl> Maybe I could create array while .click() in haystack word
[01:34:10] <Phil-Work> koosha, you mean the browser history?
[01:34:20] <agaba> faraway: yes
[01:34:27] <Phil-Work> such that the back button works
[01:36:22] <faraway> agaba: moving nodes from one document context to another should be avoided. would it be a solution for you to use $("#commercial").prepend(val.html())
[01:36:41] <agaba> faraway: I have a search page. I load the iframe and the generate the search results with javascript. When the position 10 hits on the results, I copy portion of the iframe content into the row 10. If I click link to the next page, I reload the results portion but the iframe stays intact. If I don't use clone(), the <object> portion I fetched is no more within the iframe contents. If I use the clone() the <object> tag won't be copied to the wanted row position.
[01:37:00] <agaba> faraway: lemme try that
[01:38:19] <agaba> faraway: works on first page
[01:38:30] <koosha> Phil-Work: yes
[01:41:06] <faraway> koosha: you need to do this with pushState on the history object your self. and then listen to popstate event
[01:42:18] <koosha> $("a").click causes the page to go to the "a" target
[01:42:31] <koosha> it doesn't let me load content into my div
[01:42:47] <koosha> I have set href's to target addressess
[01:43:44] <Phil-Work> koosha, does your callback function return false?
[01:44:15] <noregret> anyone here uses Datejs ?
[01:44:37] <koosha> I haven't defined a callback function
[01:44:43] <faraway> koosha: preventDefault on the event
[01:45:54] <Cork> wee spam hour coming up >_>
[01:47:27] <koosha> faraway: thanks :)
[01:50:25] <agaba> faraway: When I go to second page and the javascript is called again to scan the iframe, $('#banner-iframe-1').find('object') returns null even though the iframe is there and it contains data with <object> tag.
[01:52:56] <Cork> agaba: i think i answered that question a while back
[01:53:05] <Cork> $().contents()
[01:53:18] <fRAiLtY-> I have a script that returns a date, however if that date rolls over a month, i.e. 5 days from now based on my criteria is October the 1st. It appends the 1st correctly but doesn't rollover the month, so instead of reading 1st October it reads 1st September. It appears to "fix itself" when we're actually in that month :x http://jsfiddle.net/pp5Lj/
[01:53:22] <Cork> the object your looking for isn't a child of the iframe
[01:56:49] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: new Date(Date.now() + 10*24*60*60*1000)
[01:56:56] <fRAiLtY-> Updated to show the div http://jsfiddle.net/pp5Lj/1/
[01:57:00] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: just let js do it for you
[01:57:18] <fRAiLtY-> Where a bouts Cork?
[01:57:21] <fRAiLtY-> It's damn messy :x
[01:57:52] <koosha> event.preventDefault() doesn't work when I call $("#elem").load(content) after it
[01:58:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: when you want to change the date, convert the current date to unix time and add miliseconds for it
[01:58:50] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: and javascript will generate the new date string for you
[01:59:04] <Cork> ?eval new Date

[02:00:12] <blackspotwiggins> ie10 works IIRC
[02:00:14] <Cork> ---'
[02:00:20] <Cork> it does
[02:00:35] <Cork> but that doens't work in older windows versions so it won't really matter
[02:00:44] <blackspotwiggins> and it requires xhr2/formdata, not file api ?
[02:00:59] <Cork> no it demands the File dom api
[02:01:00] <blackspotwiggins> not entirely sure
[02:01:03] <faraway> koosha: let me guess ... it does not work for the <a> that are appended by the load function
[02:01:08] <Cork> so that you can get the file data from the input element
[02:01:27] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/File
[02:01:31] <blackspotwiggins> doesnt that work with ancient ies as well?
[02:01:35] <Cork> no
[02:01:35] <blackspotwiggins> onoes netsplit
[02:01:36] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Sorry I'm confused, are you saying my entire script is not needed or is that a line I can just add somewhere?
[02:01:43] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: its been announced
[02:01:52] <blackspotwiggins> yeah saw it
[02:01:53] <Cork> check your notice in your status window
[02:02:17] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i'm pritty much say your script isn't needed ya

[02:02:47] <fRAiLtY-> But I need to take into account bank holidays and weekends
[02:03:08] <koosha> how can I get href value of "a" tag
[02:03:15] <Cork> ya, so if the generated new date string matches your array add another day to the date object

[02:03:25] <bot-t> koosha, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[02:03:58] <fRAiLtY-> And weekends? i don't want to add all weekends to an array :x
[02:04:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: whats wrong with getDay?
[02:04:31] <blackspotwiggins> fRAiLtY-, it's trivial to detect if the day is on a weekend or not
[02:04:43] <blackspotwiggins> and you'd know it if you looked at the docs for a minute
[02:04:55] <Cork> if(d.getDay() = 0 || d.getDay() == 6) {}
[02:05:03] <Cork> *if(d.getDay() == 0 || d.getDay() == 6) {}
[02:05:09] <fRAiLtY-> I'm just annoyed that the whole script I spent ages bodging together could probably be accomplished in a couple of lines
[02:06:07] <blackspotwiggins> fRAiLtY-, try to acquire knowledge instead of solutions then
[02:06:33] <blackspotwiggins> see http://whathaveyoutried.com/

[02:09:43] <Cork> oh ah no
[02:09:47] <Cork> its $('#id .class-name')
[02:10:01] <Cork> put the div on the wrong location in your sentence :)
[02:10:45] <Matt_P> what if i already have access to div witht he id ?
[02:10:48] <Matt_P> with the *
[02:11:00] <Cork> var.find('.class-name')
[02:11:01] <Matt_P>                                     loginDialog.$(".error").innerHTML = "Hello";
[02:11:05] <Matt_P> thanks
[02:11:35] <Cork> and its .html() not innerHTML
[02:11:56] <Cork> Matt_P: you should prob read through the jquery basics
[02:12:10] <Matt_P> probably :P
[02:12:27] <chovy> should i redirect user to homepage after updating account info, or keep them on the account info page.
[02:12:28] <seutje> yeah, from that, I'd say you probably need loginDialog.find('.error').html('Hello');
[02:12:32] <blackspotwiggins> the september never ends.
[02:12:42] <Matt_P> .html() it is
[02:12:51] <Cork> chovy: just show an information section at the top of the page
[02:13:14] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: what?
[02:13:26] <Cork> ah
[02:13:56] <Matt_P> thankyou Cork and seutje
[02:13:57] <winterdj> can anyone recommend a really lightweight jquery wysiwyg toolbar plugin? I basically only need bold/underline/italic options

[02:16:17] <noregret> I have a list of those A/B dates http://pastie.org/4795959 i want to put them in a structure, where i should compare all B's and find out the more current date then get its associate A date, how can i do that in js ?
[02:17:58] <Cork> noregret: you mean you want to sort the structure based on the b column and show the first a value?
[02:18:20] <chovy> Cork: ok, that's what i'm doing. thanks
[02:18:46] <Cork> np
[02:18:47] <noregret> Cork: the A value associated with the B, yeah
[02:19:08] <Cork> and you just want the pare where the b column is the oldest?
[02:19:15] <noregret> Cork: i thought of putting all B's in an array and getting the maximum, but then there is no way to get the A
[02:19:57] <noregret> Cork: i guess so
[02:20:13] <Cork> noregret: as soon as i get to know what "most current" means i can give you a snippet :)
[02:20:54] <noregret> Cork: compare the first A/B, the most recent is B, .e.g
[02:21:15] <Cork> uh, what?
[02:21:24] <noregret> Cork: in the paste i mean
[02:21:36] <Cork> so you want to compare a with b and return the value of the two thats newest?
[02:21:45] <Cork> noregret: your giving conflicting information...
[02:22:20] <noregret> Cork: no no man, i was just giving an example, ok scratch that, compare 1st and second B, most reccent is the 2nd B, get it now ?
[02:23:05] <Cork> we'll see i give it a shot and well see if its what you meant
[02:24:02] <noregret> cool
[02:24:08] <M3kH> Hi to all!
[02:25:04] <agaba> how can I apply $(this.contentDocument).find('object'); to $('#iframe-banner-1') ???
[02:25:44] <agaba> Cork: .contents() return null
[02:26:16] <Cork> agaba: then the page inside the iframe is from another domain
[02:28:14] <agaba> Cork: no, its from the same application
[02:30:06] <fRAiLtY-> Grr Cork  I'm stuck a bit, I'm trying to add 5 days to todays date but it won't display, or if I do +5 it just appends 5 to the end of todays date :/ http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/
[02:30:44] <jacks_appendix> Morning all, is there a selector to get back a value for a set of inputs with the same name checking whether or not one of them is selected?
[02:30:51] <noregret> fRAiLtY-: try http://www.datejs.com it simplifies all date issues
[02:33:20] <Eviltwin> ?js [(new Date).toISOString(), (new Date(+new Date + 5 * 86400000)).toISOString()]
[02:33:21] <bot-t> Eviltwin: ["2012-09-25T09:33:09.916Z", "2012-09-30T09:33:09.916Z"]
[02:33:53] <fRAiLtY-> Gonna try this datejs thing
[02:33:55] <fRAiLtY-> looks a bit simpler
[02:34:01] <Cork> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/57RSa/
[02:34:12] <Cork> got a bit of a parsing problem there for a while
[02:35:09] <Cork> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/57RSa/1/ is a bit cleaner
[02:36:07] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: setDay isn't a function
[02:36:11] <Cork> so your script crashes

[02:40:49] <jacks_appendix> Morning all, is there a selector to get back a "selected" or "unselected" value for a set of radio inputs all sharing the same name(name="cars") checking whether or not one of them is selected?
[02:41:43] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[02:45:16] <jacks_appendix> Morning all, is there a simple way, without looping, to get back a "selected" or "unselected" value for a set of radio inputs all sharing the same name(name="cars") checking whether or not one of them is selected?
[02:49:05] <faraway> jacks_appendix:  $("[name=car]: checked").val()
[02:49:21] <faraway> jacks_appendix: that one ?
[02:49:44] <mehrdad|2> how do you use text placeholders in jquery elements for substituting them with real content? good old regex?
[02:50:20] <jacks_appendix> faraway, hello. I tried something like that but it doesn't seem to work: $('input[name=car]:selected'). I'm using radios, by the way
[02:50:53] <mehrdad|2> ala templates
[02:51:44] <faraway> jacks_appendix:  for radio and checkbox it is :checked and for the <option> elements it is :selected
[02:53:57] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: donno if you need it but this should do somewhat what you need http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/13/
[02:54:04] <mehrdad|2> anyone ?
[02:54:24] <Cork> mehrdad|2: you need a plugin
[02:54:39] <Cork> ?.jqote2
[02:54:40] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".jqote2" in jQuery Docs.
[02:54:44] <Cork> uh
[02:54:50] <Cork> ?g jqote2
[02:54:51] <bot-t> Cork, jQote2 ñ Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code - http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[02:54:52] <jacks_appendix> faraway, yep that did it. I had "car" in quotes as well, not sure if that was contributing. but now the selector is: ('input[name=car]:selected').val(). Thank you :)
[02:54:54] <mehrdad|2> Cork: i found a plugin named placeholder? but i thought it might be possible using simplw jquery
[02:54:55] <Cork> is the one i use
[02:55:02] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Does that do weekends?
[02:55:09] <Cork> ah forgot that one
[02:55:11] <Cork> one sec
[02:55:14] <jacks_appendix> faraway, i mean "checked"!
[02:55:17] <fRAiLtY-> Jeez you're good :x
[02:56:03] <mehrdad|2> Cork: on the official page, there's a plugin called simply Template
[02:56:06] <mehrdad|2> is that any good?
[02:56:16] <Cork> its deprecated
[02:56:19] <Cork> so no
[02:56:33] <mehrdad|2> but it says it's in beta!
[02:56:38] <mehrdad|2> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.template/
[03:01:20] <noregret> Cork: http://pastie.org/4796583 the array is not being sorted, any idea ?
[03:03:04] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/14/
[03:03:22] <Cork> i think that does it, but it becomes a bit complex so i might be thinking wrong
[03:04:14] <Cork> noregret: please use a live bin instead of paste/pastebin and the like where the code can't be run or modified
[03:04:18] <fRAiLtY-> Works for a Saturday, but not Sunday
[03:04:27] <fRAiLtY-> if I put 4 in despatch days it brings up Sunday
[03:04:34] <fRAiLtY-> Weekends should be skipped :x
[03:04:40] <Cork> of course >_<'
[03:04:50] <Cork> i add one for each week :/
[03:04:57] <Cork> theres two weekdays a week ;P
[03:05:00] <muszek> hi... I have a jquery web app that I'm turning into an android app using PhoneGap. The problem is the latest version has a bug which prohibits me from using 'keyup' event (it simply doesn't work). Is there any other event that works similarly?  I need it to be triggered when user types in stuff in a text input.
[03:05:12] <Cork> *weekend days a week
[03:05:33] <fRAiLtY-> So Saturday becomes Sunday.. ?
[03:05:49] <fRAiLtY-> Saturday needs to become Monday so weekends are "skipped" totally :/
[03:06:25] <jQuery-noob> hey first sorry for my bad english. but i have a question. i have the following code: http://nopaste.info/d208d5704b.html but the array.length is 0. can anyone help?
[03:07:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: like i said, where it calculates if its a week day you need to check for 6 too and add another value for that
[03:07:25] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: var weeks = Math.floor((despatchTime + ((today.getDay() + 1) % 6))/7) gets you sundays
[03:07:29] <Cork> you need saturdays too
[03:07:57] <fRAiLtY-> % 5 || % 6 ?
[03:08:05] <fRAiLtY-> I assume 0 is monday
[03:08:14] <Ravindran> jQuery-noob: getJSON loads response asynchronously. so, whatever you want to do with imgArray should be done in the handler after $.each call
[03:08:45] <blackspotwiggins> fRAiLtY-, srsly dude
[03:08:48] <blackspotwiggins> check the documentation
[03:08:51] <blackspotwiggins> it might help
[03:09:01] <jQuery-noob> thanks Ravindran
[03:10:36] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/17/
[03:11:37] <fRAiLtY-> So you're doing weeks*2 ? does that not multiply by 2?
[03:14:30] <Cork> ya
[03:14:34] <Rashad> hello.
[03:14:54] <Rashad> is this the right place to ask about a problem I have with a jQuery based slider ?
[03:15:09] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: cause you have passed the week end, and theres two days each week thats never part of the work week
[03:15:58] <fRAiLtY-> Oh, I see. One last thing, it ignores the bank holidays array. I've just added 01/10/2012 into there to see if it will skip Monday but it didn't :x
[03:16:16] <fRAiLtY-> Can't believe like 10 lines replaces my 100+ :/
[03:16:43] <noregret> Cork: i'm getting crazy, when i paste this http://pastie.org/4796583 in the current firebug on the current site, i get the wrong answer, but when i paste it on another firebug session on another site, it works fine... any ideas ?
[03:17:28] <noregret> Cork: and i'm getting the wrong answer in my current code
[03:30:35] <mikecmpbll> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/ - works for me
[03:32:34] <noregret> mikecmpbll: what does ?
[03:32:50] <mikecmpbll> your code, which i put into a fiddle at the link that i just pasted.
[03:33:21] <xec> mikecmpbll: click save and post the new url ;)
[03:33:26] <mikecmpbll> aw balls.
[03:33:32] <mikecmpbll> how embarassing.

[03:33:45] <mikecmpbll> there we go.
[03:33:56] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone let me know why this doesn't check against the bankHolidays array? http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/19/ It returns Monday 1st Oct which is in the array to be skipped
[03:37:39] <helly^> I'm creating a dynamic form and I want the use to be able to add contact persons. So if they click "add contact", 3 new input-fields appear.  I want to use jquery to do this. Can anybody point me the right way?

[03:40:33] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  ?

[03:42:11] <paolo> hi, what's wrong in that?  http://2.194.20.154/test4.html   I'm trying to make the entire chatbox draggable but only a part of it becomes draggable. the js code is very short.
[03:42:18] <paolo> thanks

[03:43:33] <Ring0`> Hey. When I pass strings in $.post, any special symbol changes into unicode \usomething like √≥ changes to \u00f3 ...
[03:43:39] <Ring0`> how can I prevent that
[03:43:47] <mikecmpbll> sorry, .ui-chatbox*
[03:44:00] <paolo> mikecmpbll: changed, but I can't drag it
[03:44:06] <mikecmpbll> see above^
[03:44:31] <mikecmpbll> if that doesn't work then i dunno.
[03:45:20] <paolo> it doesn't work
[03:46:52] <paolo> $("#boom.ui-chatbox")
[03:47:31] <mikecmpbll> $(".ui-chatbox")
[03:47:51] <xevi> !ask
[03:50:13] <xevi> can someone help me with this? http://pastebin.com/2jd44K6w
[03:50:45] <xec> xevi: are #id1 and #id2 the only two you want to select?
[03:51:05] <xec> if so $('#id1, #id2')
[03:51:16] <xevi> xec: well in this case yes, but I want that any "id*" pop up the alert
[03:51:42] <xevi> but that won't be totally the right way I think
[03:52:01] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone let me know why this doesn't check against the bankHolidays array? http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/21/ It returns Monday 1st Oct which is in the array to be skipped
[03:52:03] <xec> if you want any id that starts with "id" you can do $('[id^=id]')
[03:52:21] <xec> correction, $('[id^="id"]')
[03:52:22] <xevi> yes but with 'any' number?
[03:52:57] <xec> like i said, any id that starts with "id" will include "#id1" and "#id4" etc
[03:53:37] <paolo> mikecmpbll: thanks, things are improved, but when I drag it it became strange
[03:53:52] <mikecmpbll> is your example still online?
[03:53:55] <xec> xevi: does it need to be more specific? what is the exact use case?
[03:53:55] <xevi> xec: it's not working :S
[03:54:35] <xevi> I have different "id" for every post I get from my db, so I don't know if there will be 20 5 or 1000
[03:54:50] <paolo> 109.53.20.193/test4.html
[03:54:55] <xevi> and this is to identify wich post do they want to call the function "show"
[03:55:11] <xevi> it's a weird way of passing parameters I guess but I thought it would be easier
[03:55:15] <xec> xevi: http://jsfiddle.net/TWpn7/
[03:55:42] <xec> xevi: if you want to pass parameters i suggest you use the html5 data-* attributes
[03:56:01] <xec> xevi: like <div data-id="51321">
[03:56:23] <xec> xevi: then you could retrieve it with .data("id")
[03:56:40] <paolo> mikecmpbll: sorry I'm into a train
[03:56:40] <paolo> and connection is unstable
[03:57:09] <mikecmpbll> oh, haha, no probs .. i doubt i'll be able to help you, paolo.
[03:57:17] <jQuery-noob> only one more question. exist in jquery(mobile) the possibility to recognize a change in a html tag. eg: in the <img> tag the src="" has a new value and everytime if the src="" changed i want to call a function
[03:58:05] <paolo> mikecmpbll: try now
[03:58:27] <xec> xevi: http://jsfiddle.net/TWpn7/1/
[03:59:02] <mikecmpbll> haha wow, that's some interesting feature.
[03:59:07] <xevi> xec: I did not explaing myself clear sorry
[03:59:30] <mikecmpbll> hum, i can't help paolo, but you'll need to look at how your plug in is written i guess
[03:59:57] <xevi> xec: http://pastebin.com/EE2XtEry here's my table with a number of rows. I want that when the user clicks the 'toggle' button, below the table will apear the action "show" from my controller, with its full info
[04:00:37] <xevi> that's why I need that every "toggle" button has different id, because in fact it's the post's id what I need to use
[04:00:38] <xec> xevi: sorry, i can't parse php in my head. can you make a proper demo with pure html/js please? see ?demo
[04:00:38] <bot-t> xevi, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:01:19] <xevi> hmm I have no idea how to tell you with this tool my problem lol
[04:01:52] <paolo> sorry m,k
[04:01:52] <paolo> mm
[04:01:52] <paolo> mikecmpbll:
[04:01:52] <paolo> thanks anyway
[04:01:53] <xec> xevi: there are four fields, put the html in the html and the js in the javascript field ;)
[04:02:43] <xevi> it's just that I have an html table with let's say "row1" "row2" and "row3" and every row has a column with a button "toggle" with its id= to the post's id in the database
[04:02:58] <xec> xevi: what you posted in that last pastebin is practically useless for me because it is unrendered php. paste the rendered client-side html instead

[04:06:52] <noregret> mikecmpbll: well yeah, it works for me in that smw page, but nt in the page im working on...
[04:08:19] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: Date.parse expects a string, and in a different format than what you provided
[04:08:50] <fRAiLtY-> Oh, so I need to tell it a physical date string, like 1st October?
[04:09:44] <fRAiLtY-> I did a console.log('Date.parse('01/10/2012')); and it did return a timestamp, but obviously not the right one?
[04:11:10] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: hm, I might be tweaking
[04:13:17] <noregret> could someone please tell me why am i getting the wrong output http://pastie.org/4796832 the array isn't being sorted... at least for me.. if i try that code in another firebug console, it works fine..
[04:13:40] <seutje> ah, fRAiLtY-: you're passing the entire array in Date.parse, instead of just the item ur iterating over
[04:13:49] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: additionally, it expects the american format
[04:14:11] <seutje> ?eval Date.parse('31/12/2012')

[04:15:04] <blackspotwiggins> also an option
[04:15:09] <xevi> xec: here's a little update (the jquery function will hide/show the <p> instead of popping an alert like I had before) http://jsfiddle.net/dP7z4/2/
[04:16:13] <xevi> xec: sorry, here's the correct one http://jsfiddle.net/dP7z4/3/ (my apologies)
[04:17:56] <Dr4g> Any CSS3/HTML5 gurus know why when you hover your mouse over the right-side of my page, the Table of Contents doesn't retain its position: fixed attribute ?
[04:17:57] <Dr4g> http://dev.ppi.io/docs/routing.html
[04:18:27] <Dr4g> if your'e half way down the page and move your mouse to the right, you'll notice that the ToC is stuck at the top of the page.
[04:18:47] <Dr4g> (This is only happening in Chrome, it's fine in Firefox)
[04:20:22] <paolo_> mikecmpbll: here's the code. you can try it by opening the file with your browser.  http://nopaste.info/6a99499758.html
[04:20:30] <fRAiLtY-> seutje:  If I switch the 1st to yankee format (10/01/2012) it still doesn't "skip" it
[04:20:31] <fRAiLtY-> :/
[04:21:24] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: my bad
[04:21:28] <fRAiLtY-> ?eval Date.parse('10/01/2012')
[04:21:29] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-: 1349029800000

[04:22:19] <blackspotwiggins> Dr4g, works for me i think
[04:22:31] <Dr4g> blackspotwiggins: in chrome? which version and OS are you using
[04:22:38] <blackspotwiggins> 22, linux
[04:22:47] <Dr4g> blackspotwiggins: scroll half way down the page, and activate the sidebar, is the ToC there for you ?
[04:22:58] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[04:22:58] <xec> xevi: there is no javascript there? what are you trying to do?
[04:22:59] <paolo_> mikecmpbll: and others: I can drag the chat box but it has a weird behaviour
[04:23:16] <Dr4g> blackspotwiggins: can you send me a screenshot of this working in your chrome? I want to prove it to the chromium guys.
[04:23:34] <blackspotwiggins> sure, a sec
[04:23:39] <Dr4g> blackspotwiggins: thanks!
[04:23:39] <xevi> did you check the last update? (i forgot to add the jquery lib) http://jsfiddle.net/dP7z4/3/
[04:24:15] <fRAiLtY-> seutje:  Does that mean the date format isn't the issue?
[04:24:17] <blackspotwiggins> Dr4g, https://dl.dropbox.com/u/38887/Screenshot%20from%202012-09-25%2014%3A23%3A27.png
[04:24:24] <xevi> I am trying to do that when you click "toggle" in one of the many rows I have (currently 4) it will display the post's id
[04:24:52] <xevi> so when this will work i will be able to edit the <p> with a call to my "show" function to display the full information about that post
[04:24:59] <Dr4g> thanks blackspotwiggins
[04:25:55] <blackspotwiggins> Dr4g, dont rely on that url tho, i might delete it at some point
[04:25:56] <mikecmpbll> paolo_: here's a jsfiddle with your code so that it might be easier for someone to help you: http://jsfiddle.net/qsfkc/ .
[04:26:00] <Tram> Good afternoon all. Anyone knows how to get a attr of a selected option within a select?  please check this example: http://jsfiddle.net/CqRy5/1/
[04:26:20] <Dr4g> blackspotwiggins: okies
[04:27:08] <paolo_> thanks mikecmpbll
[04:27:39] <paolo_> the questio was:  http://jsfiddle.net/qsfkc/  <--- I can't drag the box properlly. what's wrong?
[04:28:53] <xec> xevi: i'm still not clear on what you want
[04:28:57] <seutje> Dr4g, blackspotwiggins: doesn't seem to work on my chromesies (OSX v 21)
[04:29:14] <xevi> don't worry then
[04:29:15] <Dr4g> seutje: i'm also on OSX v21 and it's not working for me .
[04:29:17] <Dr4g> :( :(
[04:29:21] <xec> xevi: you just want the <p> to display the content of the first <td> on the same <tr> as the <button>?
[04:29:45] <xec> i.e. "the id"?
[04:29:55] <seutje> Dr4g: I can sorta make it work by making the wrapper that's currently on position: fixed, on position: absolute and only putting the inner wrapper on fixed
[04:30:00] <Dr4g> seutje: i'm still unsure why it's even happening - If we can figure out a workaround then i'd happily just patch it until chrome fix their stuff.
[04:30:06] <xevi> no, right now I just only want the <p> to display the current row id (that will be the same id of the post)
[04:30:14] <Dr4g> seutje: can you http://gist.github.com me the selectors that you modified and their values now ?
[04:30:27] <xec> xevi: which is contained in the first <td> of the <tr>, right?
[04:30:36] <xevi> true
[04:30:55] <xec> xevi: do you control the generated html?
[04:30:56] <xevi> 25,26,27,28 at the moment
[04:31:15] <xec> xevi: like, can you store that id as a custom attribute instead?
[04:31:38] <xec> i see you've set it as the end of the ID of the button itself
[04:31:57] <xevi> exactly
[04:32:16] <xevi> i identify every button with "toggle
[04:32:36] <xevi> sorry, "toggle"+id, getting toggle25, toggle26, and so on
[04:32:42] <xec> xevi: can you change it from <button id="toggle25"> to <button class="toggle" data-id="25"> instead?
[04:32:45] <seutje> Dr4g: hang on, it disappears now after then animation is done, and it only interprets the fixed when it animates, or some weird shit
[04:33:00] <xec> xevi: much easier and cleaner to work with
[04:33:14] <xevi> ok then, yes :D
[04:34:30] <xec> xevi: then you can do $('.button').click(function(){ alert($(this).data("id"); });
[04:34:38] <Dr4g> seutje: it's weird shit indeed, I tried fixing it but i'm fairly new to CSS3 so it's difficult for me to come up with a fix on my own.
[04:34:45] <xec> xevi: and it will alert the id (of course you can do what you want with the id)
[04:35:37] <xevi> yes but this means that if I have another button in this page, it will call the jquery function won't it?
[04:35:55] <xec> xevi: only if you give it the same class...
[04:36:16] <xec> xevi: sorry not $('.button') but i meant $('.toggle')
[04:36:39] <xevi> ah COOL hehe i will try it right now
[04:38:26] <xevi> xec: ok this is working, thank you very much ^^
[04:39:00] <xevi> xec: now, how can I pass the 'id' from my jquery to the '<p>'? to show something like <p> Current post: #id# </p>
[04:39:24] <xevi> (well maybe this is a common question and I can look up for it in google)
[04:44:07] <paolo_> well, at this point I ask if you know where can I find a chatbox js widget that can be dragged and resized....
[04:45:37] <xec> xevi: you can have a <span> or something where you want the ID and just use .text() or .html() to set its contents
[04:46:01] <xec> xevi: if you want to emphasize the number <em> is a good choice
[04:46:55] <xevi> yes now it's more like a cakephp+jquery behavior than a jquery question
[04:47:16] <xevi> i will google for it, because my final point is to render a view so...
[04:47:39] <xevi> xec: thank you very much for your help and time :)
[04:48:13] <xec> you're welcome, and good luck :)
[04:48:50] <clocKwize> is there a quicker way to do this? https://gist.github.com/3781304
[04:49:32] <clocKwize> Ideally, I want $netRevenueTd.setClass("estimated", ddr.properties.net_revenue_estimated)
[04:53:37] <Dr4g> seutje: did you figure out whatever you were figuring out ? :-)
[04:53:52] <seutje> Dr4g: nope
[04:54:04] <Dr4g> seutje: :(
[04:54:12] <seutje> Dr4g: getting inconsistent results
[04:54:25] <seutje> Dr4g: like, I add z-index, and remove it and suddenly it works... for a minute
[04:54:36] <Dr4g> seutje: yea i also get painting problems
[04:54:44] <Dr4g> jitteriness and it goes invisible and such.
[04:54:55] <seutje> yeah, or goes invisible as soon as the animation is done
[04:56:41] <Dr4g> seutje: i don't know what the actual bug is, in order to say to the chrome team "this is the offending css thing"
[04:57:06] <Dr4g> if the answer is in front of them they're more likely to fix it than having to do "investigation"
[04:58:55] <Cork> what is it that fails?
[04:59:03] <Dr4g> Cork: http://dev.ppi.io/docs/routing.html
[04:59:11] <Dr4g> move mouse to the right side, the ToC pops out
[04:59:21] <Dr4g> on Chrome v21, it doesn't retain its position:fixed property
[04:59:30] <Dr4g> so when you're 50% down the page and trigger the ToC it's not there it's still at the top.
[04:59:58] <Cork> ah, i only have 18 at hand :s
[05:00:41] <helly^> I'm creating a dynamic form and I want the use to be able to add contact persons. So if they click "add contact", 3 new input-fields appear.  I want to use jquery to do this. Can anybody point me the right way?
[05:01:19] <Cork> helly^: have the contact fields in a separat html file and load it over ajax
[05:01:35] <Cork> helly^: or simply have it inline and show/hide it
[05:01:52] <termite> helly^: can they click the button more then once?
[05:01:57] <helly^> Ok. But it should be able to handle 7 contacts
[05:02:07] <helly^> So add 1 - 6
[05:02:11] <Cork> helly^: so clone the section
[05:02:11] <helly^> and remove ofc.
[05:02:17] <Cork> ?.clone
[05:02:18] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[05:02:27] <helly^> What about the variables?
[05:02:32] <Oona_> my hover state gets stuck, how can i solve this? http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/
[05:02:35] <helly^> just add $i++ ?
[05:02:39] <Cork> helly^: what variable?
[05:02:47] <Cork> you mean the field name?
[05:02:50] <helly^> variable for each field
[05:02:55] <helly^> Yes
[05:03:06] <Cork> you could use an $i ya
[05:03:20] <termite> helly:what are you using on the backend
[05:03:25] <helly^> Ok. Thanks!
[05:03:44] <helly^> termite: What do you mean? To handle the request? php
[05:04:21] <alaing> Hi  I'm having trouble escaping a string in jquery 1.4.2. This is what I have http://jsfiddle.net/TuXnU/ and it seems to work in jquery 1.8.2 but I do not have the option to upgrade the jq at this point
[05:04:38] <termite> helly: you can clone the elements and give them the same name="something[]"  this will make them an array when they come into php
[05:05:12] <helly^> termite:  ofc! Doh, stupid me. Thank you ! :-)
[05:05:13] <boulet101010> alaing, are you sure you don't have the option?
[05:05:15] <ajpiano> alaing: cmon man you're better than that
[05:05:31] <ajpiano> alaing: why would you include an inline click handler in a string of html you're injecting
[05:05:37] <ajpiano> when you could just inject the elements and bind the click after
[05:05:41] <alaing> lol @ ajpiano I know.....it been awhile since I've been here
[05:06:25] <alaing> ajpiano: haha smart man.....yeah I'll bind them later
[05:06:27] <alaing> thanks
[05:06:39] <alaing> ajpiano: are you coming to jQuery Conf UK 2013?
[05:06:47] <ajpiano> not sure, i might!
[05:06:59] <alaing> I've got tickets
[05:07:26] <alaing> would be great to meet up. is yayquery dead now?
[05:07:28] <ajpiano> awesome
[05:07:36] <ajpiano> no, we recorded a live episode last week :p
[05:07:44] <alaing> really.....
[05:07:48] <ajpiano> yeah!
[05:07:53] <Oona_> my hover state gets stuck, how can i solve this? http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/
[05:07:55] <ajpiano> we are prob gonna release it as a normal episode too, i think
[05:07:57] <Dr4g> seutje: just checked, v22 is on Beta for windows/mac
[05:07:58] <alaing> Wicked...
[05:08:01] <Dr4g> hey ajpiano :-)
[05:08:04] <ajpiano> hi
[05:08:24] <Dr4g> ajpiano: there's a bug in chrome v21 and me and seutje can't figure out a workaround for it - do you think you could give it a bash ?
[05:09:03] <clocKwize> seutje, You know that problem I was having yesterday with events not bubbling from <i /> inside a <button /> to the button click?
[05:09:26] <boulet101010> what's yayquery?
[05:09:38] <alaing> ajpiano: do you know if rmurphy will be attending jquery uk...I've seen her name mentioned a bit on twitter about it
[05:10:18] <alaing> boulet101010: its like a pink unicorn......http://yayquery.com/
[05:10:20] <clocKwize> seutje, I've just narrowed it down: $table.on("click", "button", function() { alert("test"}; }); doesn't bubble it, $table.find("button").click(function { alert("test"); }); does...

[05:11:23] <boulet101010> alaing, uuuunbelievable!
[05:11:50] <PBDev> hi :-)
[05:11:51] <alaing> boulet101010: I know!!!
[05:12:16] <PBDev> QUESTION : How do I write a conditional statement in jquery?
[05:12:27] <ajpiano> alaing: not sure, she was just trying to get them to imrpove their CFP
[05:12:35] <ajpiano> ?jsisjs @ PBDev
[05:12:35] <bot-t> PBDev, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[05:13:11] <seutje> sweet, there's a factoid for that now?
[05:13:20] <seutje> ?hi5
[05:13:20] <bot-t> ‚ã∞‚Åµ‚ã±
[05:13:33] <ajpiano> thats been there for at least 1.5 years
[05:13:34] <ajpiano> :d
[05:13:56] <termite> Oona_: are you trying to do this http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/3/
[05:14:35] <Oona_> yes, but the the 'active
[05:14:38] <Oona_> oeps
[05:14:51] <Oona_> yest, but the 'active' must not be animated
[05:16:17] <codepython777> does anyone have a cool voting widget in JS?
[05:16:23] <termite> so the active one is the one your mouse is currently over?
[05:16:32] <termite> the rest animate
[05:17:12] <alaing> codepython777: define cool?
[05:17:29] <PBDev> I have done the following with php conditional statement which works. But I want it to be dynamic so I am trying to used jquery.
[05:17:50] <PBDev> I want the html of the page to change as soon as the dropdown box selection has been made.
[05:17:52] <jeffsmykil> Is anyone using grunt?
[05:18:09] <codepython777> alaing: would be nice to be able to drag elements and rank them...My top choice, second choice, third choice
[05:18:12] <PBDev> I am not quite sure how I can write an if statement for html ouput
[05:18:13] <codepython777> from a given set of elements
[05:18:18] <Oona_> I'm trying to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/4/ But the body active button must not animate
[05:18:19] <PBDev> code is here: http://pastebin.com/QqGvE7QE
[05:19:25] <peterschmidler> I have an image gallery, where a click on the next button loads the next image and triggers an animation changing the background color. If I click next repeatedly really fast the background-color animation delays, since all animations are processed in a row. What can I do to change the animation while it is being processed?
[05:19:48] <clocKwize> seutje, cracked it. It was getting called, but I was doing $button = $(e.target) and expecting it to be a button, when it was the <i />
[05:20:14] <alaing> ajpiano: any idea when jquery ui 1.9 is likely to be released?
[05:20:15] <clocKwize> and because of jqueries awesome composite pattern, it worked but didn't do anything at all because all objects had 0 objects in them :)
[05:20:17] <termite> PBDev: $(selectboxid).change(function(){$(wrapper).load(htmlurl}); something like that
[05:20:36] <Oona_> to termite, something like this but then only the non active buttons http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/4/
[05:20:43] <ajpiano> alaing: relatively soon, it's an rc now
[05:21:37] <termite> Oona_: What defines active?  Currently animating?
[05:22:44] <alaing> I know I'm really excited about 1.9
[05:22:55] <alaing> ajpiano: ^
[05:23:03] <Oona_> to termite: http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/5/ the body id="apr12"
[05:23:12] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: do you have nodejs experience?
[05:23:24] <ajpiano> a little........
[05:23:54] <jeffsmykil> im just trying to run remove-console-logs, but im not sure of the syntax to actually run one of thes packages
[05:24:18] <ajpiano> do you .... have node installed
[05:24:24] <astropirate> also
[05:24:28] <astropirate> is your computer pluged in?
[05:24:34] <jeffsmykil> lol yes and yes
[05:24:45] <jeffsmykil> i try npm remove-console-logs path
[05:24:48] <jeffsmykil> no success
[05:24:52] <astropirate> ohh
[05:24:56] <astropirate> it ads it for node.js to find
[05:25:02] <astropirate> so in node, just require it
[05:25:11] <termite>  does it require global access
[05:25:11] <astropirate> var foo = require('my-package')
[05:25:16] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: much as i like you i am not giong to go read the docs for a npm module i've never used and tell you how to use it
[05:25:28] <ajpiano> :)
[05:26:05] <jeffsmykil> fair enough sir
[05:26:23] <jeffsmykil> may revis have a full and healthy recovery
[05:26:52] <termite> npm install npm remove-console-logs should give you errors if it doesn't install correctly
[05:27:09] <termite> err npm install remove-console-logs
[05:27:37] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: thank you :D
[05:27:55] <Oona_> to termite, to explain it simply April is active, so I dont want this LI to be animated
[05:29:24] <termite> Oona_: the reason I keep asking what defines it as active is that I don't see anything in the code or html that says this li is active
[05:29:37] <termite> so how is the JS supposed to know the difference
[05:30:25] <Oona_> to termite: in http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/5/ you can see what is active, look at the body tag in HTML
[05:30:53] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm using jquery.ie.cors.js in IE8 and for some reason my $.ajax() success function is being called twice - any idea how that could happen?
[05:31:26] <clocKwize> omg :animated. I never knew that existed. that will be useful.
[05:33:13] <termite> Oona_:do this instead http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/8/
[05:33:53] <termite> you don't want to use the id in body as a toggle
[05:34:11] <termite> just set an active class on the li that is "active"
[05:34:39] <Oona_> to termite: ok thx going to try that
[05:34:59] <termite> the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/8/ shows you how to do it
[05:40:10] <termite> jeffsmykil:  remove console logs does requires global access  so npm install -g remove-console-logs should work you may need to use sudo if you don't have admin privileges
[05:40:37] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm using jquery.ie.cors.js in IE8 and for some reason my $.ajax() success function is being called twice - any idea how that could happen?
[05:40:50] <timwis> Fiddler only shows one outbound request
[05:41:57] <termite> timwis: double bind on the thing that triggers ajax call but the second one comes from cache?
[05:42:17] <termite> shot in the dark
[05:42:53] <timwis> termite: hm, wouldn't that mean two outbound requests?
[05:43:50] <termite> timwis: not if it comes from cache.
[05:44:44] <termite> do you have a fiddle
[05:44:45] <timwis> termite: okay, but the function that houses the $.ajax() call is only called once - I have a console.log showing that. but the console.log inside the success function is called twice
[05:44:56] <timwis> termite: yes, fiddle shows one outbound request
[05:45:07] <termite> care to share
[05:45:21] <timwis> termite: oh sorry i thought you meant fiddler
[05:45:36] <timwis> sure, let me simplify it real quick
[05:54:22] <timwis> termite: http://jsfiddle.net/AV9d6/1/ there it goes, you can see in IE8 script log that SUCCESS is called twice
[05:54:27] <clocKwize> how would I find TRs where they don't contain a TD with a class of error?
[05:54:47] <Oona_> to termite: I have problem, because I load my LI's in with php include
[05:55:01] <Oona_> so i need the body= tag
[05:55:24] <Oona_> http://jsfiddle.net/bwLkM/
[05:55:57] <termite> Oona_: find some other what it's a very bad practice to do it that way.  In php you could set the active class
[05:57:46] <Oona_> ok thx
[06:04:08] <termite> timwis: I don't see anything that sticks out
[06:04:58] <timwis> termite: Are you seeing the double log of success in IE8 console?
[06:08:53] <termite> timwis: move error into the json object and see if that fixes it
[06:09:32] <termite> it's the only thing I see that is different then most calls I see
[06:09:40] <termite> it's more of a node.js style that jquery
[06:10:08] <timwis> termite: hm, I think I originally did that so I could have it be triggered on timeout. though I don't see why it wouldn't be
[06:10:49] <termite> below the success: just add error:
[06:10:55] <termite> and remove .error
[06:11:16] <termite> I don't know if it will fix it but it's worth a try
[06:11:36] <termite> you are also missing some ;'s
[06:11:43] <termite> but that shouldn't be doing it
[06:11:52] <timwis> termite: didn't fix it :/
[06:11:56] <timwis> http://jsfiddle.net/AV9d6/2/
[06:15:00] <termite> put var in front of ulrs311.service_areas
[06:15:58] <termite> timwis: put var in front of timwis
[06:16:16] <termite> error in front of ulrs311.service_areas
[06:16:25] <timwis> lol what
[06:16:46] <termite> var ulrs311.service_areas = function (address){//, callback) {
[06:16:48] <var_timwis> like this? :P
[06:17:13] <javalover> i love when people make retarded variables
[06:17:43] <javalover> this aint no movie, it's coding, in real life it's just basic algebra lets try to keep it that way
[06:17:53] <javalover> var t19blackopsborg = 5; lol
[06:18:37] <boulet101010> could paste some good examples of this kind of code from my boss
[06:18:57] <boulet101010> like var hate = whyitdoesn'twork; function ohshit() {
[06:19:34] <termite> javalover:  My favorite was when the "Lead" programmer at an old job put in $true==true
[06:20:19] <javalover> lol
[06:20:22] <termite> later in the code he had $true=false
[06:20:24] <timwis> termite: I don't think you're supposed to put var in front like that. I'm getting syntax error on the .
[06:20:50] <javalover> and this person was hired?
[06:20:53] <javalover> no wonder i'm unemployed
[06:20:58] <termite> I had to kill him it was a matter of principle the jury saw it my way also
[06:21:19] <seutje> termite: he must have loved C-style operator overload
[06:21:47] <javalover> what i love is all my nerdy aquantences
[06:22:01] <endberg> hi
[06:22:01] <javalover> who feel that because they speak through their nose & like bottle rockets, this somehow makes them expert coders
[06:22:09] <termite> ohh yeah I say this crap all the time $$true = false
[06:22:20] <javalover> and how I felt before I started coding
[06:22:30] <javalover> and then how I felt AFTER I learned what it meant to code
[06:22:35] <seutje> bottle rockets are for pussies
[06:22:37] <javalover> same goes for chess & the rubiks cube i'm just saying
[06:22:40] <seutje> just ask MrCarmack
[06:23:03] <javalover> people who ACT smart, generally aren't
[06:23:27] <termite> timwis: put a ; at the end of your function definition
[06:23:27] <javalover> they know facts here & there, but when it comes to learning a skill....that has nothing to do with looks
[06:23:53] <javalover> in fact i've found the best coders are ones who think outside the box
[06:23:56] <Cork> termite: when you add members to an object you'r not suppose to use var
[06:24:11] <Cork> termite: cause your not declaring a variable
[06:24:15] <javalover> look at steve jobs for example, did a bunch of acid & was like "this is what the world needs"
[06:24:22] <timwis> termite: I did
[06:24:33] <endberg> I have and array (channels)  loaded with objects (channelObjects), and I'd like to  display these objects, grouped by one object property (ts). http://jsfiddle.net/gwtA2/
[06:24:36] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; var a.member = true;
[06:24:38] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[06:24:40] <javalover> now woz on the other hand was that crazy nerd
[06:24:41] <termite> ahh crap Cork is right it is an object didn't catch that
[06:24:52] <termite> Cork is right again :)
[06:24:58] <PBDev> QUESTION: how do we write a query where such as if a statement is true, we display a contents of a div?
[06:25:10] <javalover> is that a real question?
[06:25:22] <Cork> PBDev: you mean a jquery selector?
[06:25:26] <PBDev> so lets say I have <div id="home">test</div>
[06:25:28] <Cork> PBDev: or what do you mean by query?
[06:25:34] <javalover> no I think he means literally just to check & see if something is true
[06:25:37] <javalover> he doesn't know how to do this
[06:25:49] <Cork> O_o'
[06:25:53] <javalover> that's the first thing I ever learned
[06:25:56] <PBDev> and in a dropdown box we have home and garden...
[06:26:00] <javalover> if(myvar == true){//dostuff}
[06:26:19] <PBDev> depending on the selection, home or garden, we display div id="home" OR div id="garden"
[06:26:27] <javalover> lol this kid is so new
[06:26:36] <PBDev> so lets say I have <div id="garden">test 2</div>
[06:26:37] <codepython7771>  does anyone have a cool voting widget in bootstrap? I need a set of elements ranked by the user as top choice, second choice, third choice and so on.
[06:26:53] <javalover> PBDev have you ever taken a coding course?
[06:26:56] <PBDev> so basically connecting to the div already on the page.
[06:26:58] <PBDev> yes
[06:27:05] <javalover> in what language and what city of what state?
[06:27:07] <Cork> PBDev: $('select').change(function() { $('.options').hide(); $('#' + $(this).val()).show(); });
[06:27:12] <termite> timwis: I have to go but I would ask Cork he might be able to help.  Let me know what the solution is
[06:27:28] <Cork> PBDev: add the options class to the different divs so that you can hide both easy
[06:27:34] <PBDev> almost all
[06:27:53] <javalover> ur question astounds me
[06:28:18] <Cork> javalover: drop the insults
[06:28:21] <javalover> but corks answer astounds me even more
[06:28:31] <javalover> k srry
[06:28:37] <javalover> but I mean seriously?
[06:28:58] <javalover> i've been redirected out of this channel for asking a php question
[06:29:16] <javalover> and this guy asks "how do you check if something is true"
[06:29:24] <javalover> but aight i apologize it's okay i'm sorry
[06:29:43] <Cork> javalover: he asked a jquery question, you (according to your own statement) asked a php question
[06:29:44] <timwis> okay termite thanks
[06:29:48] <Cork> thats the difference
[06:29:54] <javalover> in fact imma /part because i'm just i've been up too late
[06:30:08] <javalover> so the troll in me is coming out & I apologize for that
[06:30:12] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/24/ it ignores the bank holidays array. I've tried switching to mm/dd/yyyy instead of dd/mm/yyyy but no luck. I've done a date.parse on them and they seem fine, well they return a stamp. But for some reason they aren't being skipped if they're in the array, for example 01/10/2012 still appears as a date.
[06:30:28] <javalover> a big part of me is like "dude just apologize & leave" so again i'm sorry

[06:30:45] <timwis> Hey Cork, so I'm using jquery.ie.cors.js on IE8 and I'm getting two success callbacks on my $.ajax() call. Fiddler/network log shows one outbound request, but my success callback is called twice. Any idea why? http://jsfiddle.net/AV9d6/2/
[06:30:55] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i think its that the times doesn't fully match
[06:31:16] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: was afraid of that, but didn't have the time to test
[06:31:25] <fRAiLtY-> Oh, should I add 00:00:00 to my array values?
[06:31:26] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: ur still using the entire array instead of the index ur iterating over?
[06:31:27] <fRAiLtY->  Would that help?
[06:31:51] <fRAiLtY-> seutje:  Sorry I must have missed a post, earlier we were discussing it might be uk/us date formats
[06:31:59] <fRAiLtY-> That was that last thing I saw from you on it, did I miss smt?
[06:32:14] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: before that, I said u were using the entire array instead of just the value at i
[06:32:36] <fRAiLtY-> That's because I  need to check whether the date returned is in the entire array, no?
[06:32:42] <seutje> Date.parse(bankHolidays) vs Date.parse(bankHolidays[i])
[06:32:55] <seutje> ur already looping over the array and parse doesn't take arrays
[06:34:08] <fRAiLtY-> Date.parse(bankHolidays[i]) makes no differene
[06:34:59] <Cork> wow...
[06:35:03] <Cork> just noticed...
[06:35:11] <Cork> Date.parse fails BADLY
[06:35:15] <PBDev> http://pastebin.com/gdhE5epF > Cork
[06:35:21] <seutje> it's so random
[06:35:28] <PBDev> I tried doing what you said, didnt quite work.
[06:35:53] <Cork> ?eval Date.parse("27/08/2012")
[06:35:54] <bot-t> Cork: 1394217000000
[06:36:00] <Cork> ?eval new Date("27/08/2012")
[06:36:01] <bot-t> Cork: <2014-03-07T18:30:00.000Z>
[06:36:08] <Cork> thats the wrong YEAR >_<'
[06:36:13] <seutje> haha
[06:36:15] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/FYn7E/ any ideas why this isn't changing 'thumbnail' to 'image' and back?
[06:36:16] <Cork> and everything else is...
[06:36:24] <fRAiLtY-> :(
[06:36:51] <fRAiLtY-> Damn
[06:37:06] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you need to format the date according to the rfc2822 standard
[06:37:08] <Cork> http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14
[06:37:15] <seutje> chrome straight up gives me invalid date for that
[06:37:42] <seutje> .eval new Date('2012-08-27');
[06:37:46] <seutje> ?eval new Date('2012-08-27');
[06:37:46] <bot-t> seutje: <2012-08-27T00:00:00.000Z>
[06:38:12] <seutje> but fRAiLtY-, even before that loop, arival is already set to october 1st
[06:38:47] <Cork> seutje: interesting all browsers i've tested fails on that one >_>
[06:39:00] <Cork> ah, no wait my mistake
[06:39:31] <Cork> good if i don't try to have 27 months in this year :)
[06:39:42] <velcrobots> need some opinions.  i am using the google charts API to render several graphs on a page.  the majority of them are hidden (with a css rule of display:none) and I use jquery to hide/show them one at a time.  the problem is when google renders a chart to a hidden div, the layout is a little off - I'm assuming it depends on a width/height, which if i remember correcty a hidden div is = 0.  any ideas?
[06:40:32] <Cork> velcrobots: set width and height on the img element
[06:40:47] <velcrobots> cork: there are no images involved
[06:41:07] <Cork> uh, then we'r thinking of different api's
[06:41:46] <velcrobots> cork: yeah the google charts ends up rendering an html5 graph
[06:42:10] <Cork> ah...
[06:42:18] <Cork> interesting they've scrapped the old api
[06:42:22] <codepython7771> anyone knows of a good ranking widget ?
[06:42:27] <Cork> haven't used it in about a year
[06:42:30] <fRAiLtY-> ?eval 2012-10-01
[06:42:31] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-: 2001
[06:42:33] <fRAiLtY-> oops
[06:42:36] <Cork> lol
[06:42:38] <codepython7771> or can help me build one?
[06:42:41] <fRAiLtY-> ?eval new Date('2012-10-01')
[06:42:41] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-: <2012-10-01T00:00:00.000Z>
[06:42:45] <fRAiLtY-> That's right
[06:42:51] <Cork> ya
[06:43:00] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, I've changed my date array to that format, what next guys?
[06:43:18] <fRAiLtY-> ?eval new Date('01/10/2012')
[06:43:18] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-: <2012-01-09T18:30:00.000Z>
[06:43:19] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you need to add midnight.setMiliseconds(0)
[06:43:31] <fRAiLtY-> lola I see how that date thing is wrong now :x
[06:44:11] <blackspotwiggins> ?evail Date.UTC(2012,10,1) @ fRAiLtY-
[06:44:12] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-, SourceForge.net: LimeSurvey - the Online Survey Tool: limesurvey ... - http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=limesurvey-subversion&max_rows=25&style=nested&viewmonth=201106
[06:44:16] <blackspotwiggins> damnit
[06:44:19] <blackspotwiggins> ?eval Date.UTC(2012,10,1) @ fRAiLtY-
[06:44:20] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-: 1351728000000
[06:44:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the biggest problem with the xx/xx/xx or xx/xx/xxxx format is that you don't know what the different values are
[06:45:01] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: its an array of date strings
[06:45:27] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/28/ still getting 1st october appear dammit lol
[06:45:29] <Cork> would be unneeded to store full date objects in the array
[06:45:41] <noregret> $('body').on('click', '.spams.index .paging a', function(e){}) shouldn't this alwys select the anchor ? it was working before and it stopped when i moved some divs here and there.. any idea what could have caused it ?
[06:45:50] <seutje> heh
[06:46:37] <blackspotwiggins> Cork, to validate against?
[06:46:56] <fRAiLtY-> I see what you mean seutje  about 1st oct being set before the if, but the var is re-set within the if, so if the if is true, then it should be "overwritten" right?
[06:47:00] <fRAiLtY-> wow that sounds messy
[06:48:37] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: but "arival" isn't set properly, and then the array is checked against that
[06:48:55] <seutje> so your conditional will never match when you expect it to, as your initial date is wrong
[06:49:25] <fRAiLtY-> Ah, am I right in thinking it needs to have the time zero'd
[06:49:35] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: uggg.
[06:49:37] <fRAiLtY-> Just done a console log, and it's literally now
[06:49:41] <Cork> the array is never used >_<'
[06:49:54] <Cork> man what a stupid typo
[06:50:06] <fRAiLtY-> my bad?
[06:50:06] <Cork> ([i] is missing)
[06:50:08] <Cork> no
[06:50:13] <seutje> said that eons ago
[06:50:17] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/31/
[06:50:43] <Cork> fixed a few other typos too
[06:51:01] <seutje> lol got sick of arival being spelled with 1 r?
[06:51:04] <seutje> me too :P
[06:51:09] <Cork> heh
[06:51:24] <Cork> ya typo'ed that the first time i did it, and was to lazy to fix it :)
[06:51:30] <fRAiLtY-> I was wondering that, thought it was a language thing as Cork wrote that bit :D
[06:51:55] <seutje> I hate date rubbish
[06:51:59] <Cork> the last getTime wasn't called as a function
[06:52:03] <Cork> that was the other error
[06:52:11] <seutje> ah
[06:52:25] <fRAiLtY-> I notice >= and =<
[06:52:36] <Cork> yup thats another one
[06:54:05] <fRAiLtY-> Presumably this would work included as a .js file yeah?
[06:54:27] <Cork> as long as you wrap it in a function call that you use; ya
[06:54:53] <Cork> well actually
[06:55:05] <Cork> it would work as long as you wrap it in dom ready
[06:55:21] <fRAiLtY-> Cool, thanks for all your help, and seutje.
[06:56:47] <pingec> is thee a method like .get() only that it returns a jquery object?
[06:56:50] <pingec> *there
[06:57:03] <barraponto> pingec: what?
[06:57:12] <Cork> ?.eq @ pingec
[06:57:23] <Cork> <_<
[06:57:28] <Cork> bot-t dies again?
[06:57:36] <pingec> ooo, thanks :)
[06:57:39] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[06:57:42] <pingec> could not google it out
[06:57:58] <Cork> pingec: btw theres no reason to use .get
[06:58:07] <Cork> thats just a wrapper function for []
[06:58:31] <Cork> $(selector)[0] gives you the same thing as $(selector).get(0)
[06:58:37] <Cork> except .get needs to go over a function call
[06:58:38] <barraponto> Cork: sometimes you really want the array of dom items
[06:59:22] <Cork> barraponto: what?
[06:59:41] <Cork> barraponto: the point is that the array is accessable straight on the $() function
[06:59:46] <Cork> no need to go over .get
[06:59:52] <barraponto> Cork: sometimes you're interacting with other libraries and they need an array of dom elements
[07:00:07] <Cork> barraponto: $() gives you an array
[07:00:20] <barraponto> i thought it gave me an object
[07:00:50] <Cork> for(var i = 0;i < $('selector').length; i++) { alert($('selector')[i].innerHTML) }
[07:01:13] <Cork> barraponto: it gives you an array like object, but it does everything an array do
[07:01:33] <Cork> (btw PLEASE never run code like that :D )
[07:01:37] <Cork> for(var i = 0;i < $('selector').length; i++) { alert($('selector')[i].innerHTML) } <--
[07:01:37] <fuchstronaut> having code inside $(function(){ //code goes here }); can I be sure everythings loaded into the dom?
[07:01:51] <Cork> yes
[07:02:12] <bot-t> pingec, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[07:02:27] <Cork> bot-t: so you woke up now huh?
[07:02:27] <bot-t> Cork, Signs point to yes.
[07:02:49] <barraponto> Cork: why would i do that? arrays have their own native iteration methods
[07:02:49] <Cork> fuchstronaut: $(function() {}); is called when the browser notifies javascript that the dom has stabilized after the page load
[07:02:53] <barraponto> and jquery too.
[07:03:10] <Cork> barraponto: the native array itterator isn't cross browser
[07:03:23] <Cork> barraponto: and no it was just an example that jquery gives you a fully valid array
[07:03:23] <barraponto> jquery is :D
[07:03:33] <ajpiano> barraponto: .get() with no arguments returns a native array
[07:03:40] <ajpiano> Cork: and jquery doesn't give you an array, it gives you a jquery object
[07:03:41] <fuchstronaut> Cork: I am having a problem where certain elements are not beeing hidden/fadeOut after pageload. Though I can log the elements into my console
[07:03:45] <ajpiano> which is very similar to an array but isn't.
[07:03:46] <barraponto> ajpiano: yeah, that's how we got started.
[07:04:05] <Cork> ajpiano: yes my point was that what jquery gives you works just fine as an array
[07:04:11] <Cork> that was the hole argument :)
[07:04:32] <barraponto> i wanted to use the .reduce Array method and couldn't use it on a jquery object :/
[07:05:08] <Cork> hmm, you got a point there
[07:05:10] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/FYn7E/ any ideas why this isn't changing 'thumbnail' to 'image' and back?
[07:05:23] <danzik17> barraponto: it can probably use an array-like object though, so Array.prototype.reduce.call( myjQueryObject, .... )
[07:05:24] <barraponto> Cork: but yeah, i got what you meant. thanks for the tip.
[07:05:29] <wingy> who is behind jQuery project .. are they volunteers?
[07:05:38] <blackspotwiggins> illuminati
[07:05:44] <barraponto> the hackers
[07:05:45] <wingy> do they work after their job?
[07:05:47] <blackspotwiggins> they already control half the web..
[07:05:54] <Cork> barraponto: well actually i would say you was the one that had a point i didn't think of
[07:06:00] <fuchstronaut> Is it true, that I can't fadeOut/hide an element it its parent element is hidden already?
[07:06:05] <Cork> mostly cause many of those isn't cross browser
[07:06:06] <barraponto> Cork: double win
[07:06:09] <Cork> :)
[07:06:23] <ajpiano> wingy: the jQuery Foundation
[07:06:24] <Cork> fuchstronaut: yes
[07:06:43] <Cork> fuchstronaut: cause all children to a hidden element is hidden
[07:06:48] <pingec> cork yes thanks, I do know about [], I mentioned .get because it seemed easier to explain this way
[07:06:51] <barraponto> ajpiano: that's a proxy to the illuminati
[07:06:57] <Pilate> nFFF: looks like it works fine
[07:06:57] <fuchstronaut> Cork: can I set the elements css after the fadeOut() is called to make sire its hidden whatever its parents status is?
[07:06:59] <ajpiano> no it isn't
[07:07:00] <Cork> no matter what that child in its self has css wise
[07:07:00] <wingy> ajpiano: they have a regular job besides jquery project?
[07:07:05] <ajpiano> wingy: i am one of them
[07:07:09] <ajpiano> yes i have a regular job
[07:07:16] <wingy> who are you here http://jquery.org/team/
[07:07:21] <ajpiano> we have a paid executive director
[07:07:21] <nFFF> No one can help? :|
[07:07:24] <ajpiano> and some contract positions
[07:07:30] <nFFF> I dont understand why its not changing it back
[07:07:31] <barraponto> ajpiano: i have an extraordinary job :D
[07:07:32] <Cork> fuchstronaut: if a parent element is hidden the browser never tries to render a child
[07:07:35] <Pilate> its doing excactly what you said, nFFF
[07:07:42] <ajpiano> wingy: adam sontag
[07:07:43] <nFFF> unless the console log is firing after the var change?
[07:07:52] <nFFF> Pilate, check console, it doesn't change
[07:07:55] <Cork> fuchstronaut: so you can't ever to anything on a child to make it vissible, except change the state of the parent
[07:07:55] <wingy> ajpiano: where do you get the money from?
[07:07:56] <Pilate> yes, it does
[07:07:56] <fuchstronaut> Hmm.. I need to make sure certain elements are hidden, even if the parent elements will be shown
[07:07:58] <nFFF> unless it's changing back before the log
[07:08:02] <wingy> ajpiano: donations?
[07:08:04] <seutje> barraponto: can't u just expose it on jquery objects?
[07:08:17] <ajpiano> wingy: donations somewhat, we also have a corporate and individual membership program that was started recently
[07:08:21] <ajpiano> the foundation is a relatively new thing
[07:08:31] <Cork> fuchstronaut: you can make sure that the child isn't visible when the parent is shown; sure that works
[07:08:36] <ajpiano> we only started it in february, there was a different infrasturuture before that
[07:08:40] <Cork> fuchstronaut: just run .hide() on the element
[07:08:42] <wingy> ajpiano: what is the program about? support and training?
[07:08:50] <nFFF> Pilate can you look at my comments
[07:08:50] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/FYn7E/1/
[07:08:56] <nFFF> and tell me wher my logic is wrong
[07:09:03] <ajpiano> which program? the membership?
[07:09:15] <fuchstronaut> Cork: I have that hidden parent container, where i search for some elements and hide them, so if the parent is later shown, these hidden childrens are still not visible
[07:09:17] <wingy> ajpiano: yeah
[07:09:17] <barraponto> seutje: yeah, dude, just had to $().get().doFancyArrayStuff()
[07:09:30] <barraponto> seutje: anyway, it wasn't a doubt, we were just talking about it. thanks :D
[07:09:42] <ajpiano> mostly about showing support for jquery and facilitating its continued existence
[07:09:46] <seutje> barraponto: http://jsfiddle.net/t6VMt/
[07:10:33] <Pilate> nFFF: youre insane, its doing exactly what you want http://jsfiddle.net/Pilate/FYn7E/2/
[07:10:36] <barraponto> seutje: cool :D
[07:10:43] <Darsain> what is the most simple way how to call "self invoking anonymous function" ? :)
[07:10:53] <wingy> ajpiano: im curious about how it works in OS .. eg. who initiated jquery mobile?
[07:10:56] <barraponto> seutje: bet that's how many of the jquery array-like properties are added.
[07:11:03] <fuchstronaut> Turns out I just have to chain css('display','none') after fadeOut to make sure the children elements stay hidden
[07:11:07] <wingy> its 100 times better than ExtJS/Sencha touch imo
[07:11:09] <noregret> $('body').on('click', '.spams.index .paging a', function(e){}) shouldn't this alwys select the anchor ? it was working before and it stopped when i moved some divs here and there.. any idea what could have caused it ?
[07:11:21] <seutje> ?g iife @ Darsain
[07:11:29] <ajpiano> wingy: kind of happened before my time, jquery mobile did
[07:11:30] <seutje> wasn't it iife?
[07:11:39] <Cork> barraponto: var arrlike = { length: 0 };
[07:11:46] <seutje> immediately-invoked function expression or what was it again?
[07:12:02] <ajpiano> wingy: but basically filament group was working with the project closely at the time
[07:12:25] <arielserafini> ajpiano, speaking of memberships, I never received a reply to the e-mail I sent :/
[07:12:39] <seutje> Darsain: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[07:12:41] <ajpiano> arielserafini: who'd you send an e-mail to?
[07:12:42] <ajpiano> me?
[07:12:54] <Darsain> seutje: yeah, reading it right now :) thx
[07:13:02] <arielserafini> ajpiano, membeship@ something
[07:13:02] <barraponto> ajpiano: is there a link to the membership program?
[07:13:11] <arielserafini> membership*
[07:13:19] <ajpiano> barraponto: we haven't actually publicly launched it yet, it's something that's happening in the next few weeks
[07:13:20] <barraponto> ajpiano: bet it's not http://jquery.org/donate/
[07:13:36] <seutje> ajpiano: go away, I'm too poor
[07:13:38] <barraponto> ajpiano: yay i want to be a member before it becomes cool
[07:13:43] <ajpiano> rad :)
[07:13:46] <ajpiano> barraponto: i'll let you know
[07:13:47] <wingy> ajpiano: if one has money and uses jquery mobile/jquery as foundation for the entire success .. what is the best way to ensure the continued growth in features and bug fixes in jquery mobile?
[07:13:58] <seutje> so u'll stop being a member once it's cool?
[07:14:14] <barraponto> seutje: no.
[07:14:26] <barraponto> seutje: but if it's cool already i won't join LOL
[07:14:29] <seutje> terrible hipster!
[07:14:44] <seutje> ur suppose to denounce whatever catches the least bit of fame
[07:14:58] <ajpiano> wingy: well, you can get involved in the project and contribute back yourself
[07:15:02] <seutje> that wasn't expressed right :/
[07:15:14] <barraponto> seutje: oh no, that attitude is so 2012.
[07:15:40] <ajpiano> wingy: or you can donate or join the foundation, etc
[07:15:46] <ajpiano> wingy: we are actually having a developer event very soon
[07:15:55] <wingy> developer event for what?
[07:15:57] <bot-t> Darsain, Ben Alman ª Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) - http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/

[07:17:00] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Trying to make this into a function so I can just pass a value to it and get it to calculate and return, I think I've put it into a function correctly, but how would I now call it. I followed some guides on stack overflow but I can't figure out how to call it :x http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/34/
[07:17:44] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: y u put it on the $.fn.namespace?
[07:17:54] <wingy> ajpiano: cool initiative
[07:18:02] <fRAiLtY-> seutje:  I read on stack overflow that's how to do functions, is it not?
[07:18:13] <wingy> what is the main purpose of that event? finding devs to become active developers?
[07:18:34] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: link me so I can downvote the poop out of that plz
[07:18:44] <fRAiLtY-> oops sorry :x
[07:18:44] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: link me so I can downvote the poop out of that plz

[07:19:07] <wingy> wow
[07:19:07] <fRAiLtY-> seutje:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7470521/create-function-in-jquery
[07:19:09] <fRAiLtY-> What's the correct way?
[07:19:14] <wingy> crowd development!
[07:19:16] <wingy> in 2 days
[07:19:30] <seutje> stuff on $.fn.namespace is for calling on jQuery collections
[07:19:46] <fRAiLtY-> Oh, I just want a standard function
[07:20:04] <seutje> yeah, just var foo = function(args) { } will do
[07:20:25] <seutje> unless you're namespacing your application (which you prolly should)
[07:20:31] <barraponto> ajpiano: once jquery org has the resources, you should think of scholarships for the largest events
[07:20:34] <barraponto> ajpiano: like https://association.drupal.org/drupalcon/scholarships
[07:20:43] <ajpiano> barraponto: yeah, we have definitely already thought about it
[07:20:45] <barraponto> ajpiano: after all, not everyone lives in north america and europe
[07:21:00] <rworth> arielserafini I've got your email in my queue. Waiting for the program to fully launch in the next couple weeks
[07:21:01] <rworth> stay tuned
[07:21:24] <ajpiano> barraponto: indeed yeah
[07:21:30] <rworth> barraponto we'll also be doing events in other parts of the world
[07:21:31] <ajpiano> we are also having more international confs as well
[07:21:33] <ajpiano> lol
[07:21:40] <rworth> :)
[07:21:51] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/fWJET/36/ now u can pass it a date, and it'll use today if no date was passed
[07:21:59] <arielserafini> rworth, awesome! I was wondering if I got the address wrong or something. thanks a bunch
[07:22:01] <rworth> there are 6 international confs planned for the next 12 months. We encourage all conferences to add an extra day like this
[07:22:36] <seutje> drupal scholarships are a nightmare though
[07:22:56] <rworth> seutje how can we do better?
[07:23:42] <bot-t> seutje, Outlook good.

[07:25:09] <arielserafini> since we're all chatty and stuff
[07:25:17] <arielserafini> ajpiano, you mentioned doing a yayquery episode recently, right?
[07:25:26] <arielserafini> is it live somewhere?

[07:26:16] <ajpiano> we'll prob be doing a normal edited ep too
[07:26:42] <arielserafini> ajpiano, nice, thank you. is this coming back?

[07:33:46] <noregret> http://pastebin.com/mZkmYfWR this is not selecting, any ideas why?
[07:34:50] <Pilate> because your selectors are wrong?
[07:35:15] <ravenzz> noregret what is your markup?
[07:35:44] <abisson> Hey guys‚Ä¶  just a "style" question‚Ä¶ would you add generic functions for example " function addThisButtonSomewhere() {}" inside the $(function() { ‚Ä¶.. Load when document is ready }); or outside of this?
[07:37:30] <blackspotwiggins> abisson, inside
[07:37:38] <abisson> blackspotwiggins: thanks!
[07:37:43] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont need to have it available
[07:37:50] <blackspotwiggins> always use the innermost scope
[07:37:55] <abisson> perfect
[07:37:56] <abisson> thanks a lot
[07:38:45] <ajpiano> not really
[07:38:56] <ajpiano> it's kind of odd to defer defining your application until after doc ready
[07:40:15] <noregret> ravenzz: html, and '.spams.index .paging a' is a valid selector as I tested it
[07:40:27] <ravenzz> it is
[07:40:35] <ravenzz> but What is your markup?
[07:41:13] <ravenzz> include the HTML in the pastebin
[07:41:31] <blackspotwiggins> ajpiano, if the alternative is to have everything as global..
[07:41:37] <ajpiano> it isn't
[07:41:51] <ravenzz> blackspotwiggins you can create a fancy object
[07:41:54] <ravenzz> say utils
[07:41:58] <ajpiano> there are a myriad of alternatives including defining an application namespace or using a module system
[07:42:01] <ravenzz> and expose only what you need
[07:42:20] <blackspotwiggins> well, as abisson asked there were two options
[07:42:24] <ajpiano> if you have a function like addButtonTo(location) {} signs are your app isn't that well organised to begin with
[07:47:28] <Gho5t> so I know a lot of people use .each to check if an element exists before doing manipulations on them e.g. $('#foo').each(function() { $(this).css(.......
[07:47:33] <Gho5t> is it really necessary?
[07:47:41] <Gho5t> I notice I'm not getting erros in my console if it doesn't exist
[07:47:50] <ajpiano> what
[07:47:52] <ajpiano> people don't do that
[07:48:03] <ajpiano> if you need to check if an element exists, you make a selection and then check the length
[07:48:08] <Gho5t> I've seen that in more than one project
[07:48:12] <Gho5t> yes I usually do that
[07:48:17] <ajpiano> congrats
[07:48:21] <Gho5t> but I've seen others use .each
[07:48:25] <ajpiano> ah ok
[07:48:26] <Gho5t> thinking it was more concise
[07:48:34] <ajpiano> well, it's very odd to use .each
[07:48:46] <Gho5t> ok
[07:48:46] <ajpiano> the point is to avoid unnecessary iteration, not use iteration to avoid... not doing anything
[07:48:47] <blackspotwiggins> i sometimes use it to avoid doing the same query and the comfort of using this inside the each
[07:48:49] <wingy> ajpiano: do you know how many active devs are working on the jquery mobile?
[07:49:00] <ajpiano> wingy: #jquerymobile-dev :)
[07:49:07] <ajpiano> there are at least 5
[07:49:07] <blackspotwiggins> but it's mostyle laziness
[07:49:11] <Gho5t> well if ajpiano says it's garbage it must be
[07:49:16] <blackspotwiggins> mostly*
[07:49:20] <wingy> ajpiano: oh didnt know there was a dev channel
[07:49:31] <ajpiano> wingy: indeed
[07:49:31] <Gho5t> ajpiano: would you really get any overhead if the element wasn't found?
[07:49:35] <blackspotwiggins> wingy, check /topic
[07:49:42] <Gho5t> or are you just saying it causes more overhead if it does
[07:50:07] <ajpiano> it probably would be insignificant but it's just a really odd way to achieve the means
[07:50:10] <ajpiano> the end*
[07:50:15] <ravenzz> Gho5t I am afraid that you meant elem.is(':hidden')
[07:50:23] <fRAiLtY-> Why am I getting a failure on jslint here: http://jsfiddle.net/dmkTe/2/
[07:50:33] <Gho5t> ravenzz: I'm afraid I didn't
[07:50:43] <ravenzz> I am afraid = I think
[07:50:44] <ravenzz> sorry
[07:50:49] <fRAiLtY-> line 18 is a comment line :x
[07:51:13] <danzik17> fRAiLtY-: what's jslint saying?
[07:51:36] <CodesStuff> fRaiLty: I'm not getting any errors in my console.. Maybe remove the comments and see if it bugs out on jslint again?
[07:51:37] <fRAiLtY-> danzik17:  Problem at line 18 character 14: Cannot set property 'first' of undefined - but that's a // commented line
[07:51:46] <Gho5t> ajpiano: the same question applies, if I'm not checking the length and I perform some manipulations on $('#foo'), it doesn't throw any errors so do I really need to check first?
[07:52:00] <ajpiano> it won't throw errors, but there is some overhead
[07:52:43] <ravenzz> Gho5t if you want to be "fast" you can do var foo = $('#foo'); foo.length && foo.hide().whatever();
[07:53:20] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/dmkTe/3/ lol, an error on a blank line? I've deleted it and re-added but no luck :x Problem at line 15 character 14: Cannot set property 'first' of undefined
[07:54:12] <Gho5t> ok thanks
[07:54:55] <danzik17> fRAiLtY-: i'm not getting that error from the jslint web interface.  you using an outdated plugin for something by any chance?
[07:55:22] <fRAiLtY-> I'm using JSLint on jsfiddle with onLoad jQuery 1.8.2 ?
[07:57:05] <danzik17> fRAiLtY-: i'd guess that their jslint is screwing something up.

[08:48:34] <mehrdad> $('#slider-wrapper').css('display', 'block');
[08:49:01] <mehrdad> shouldn't that show a  display:none element?
[08:49:14] <lombrozo> boulet101010: I can only only see it if the z-index of 'image-1' is set to -1 (at which point the image goes all black)...

[09:06:29] <hackeron> hey, I have this page: http://demo1.xanview.com:9292/perspectives - I would like to automatically refresh the images after they load (to simulate live view) - I tried to just load the next image on .load and to use setTimeout to delay loading the next image, but it really slows the browser down. I want to implement some kind of "worker" that will process the images one at a time. Any pointers? Maybe web workers?
[09:10:50] <firstclassfunc_> is it bad practice to gather whatever data you want, and then create a form on the fly and submit it with the data like $("<form><input type="hidden" id="whatever" value="whatever">...</form>).submit();?
[09:14:31] <danzik17> firstclassfunc_: why do that?  just submit it with $.ajax if you're creating the entire thing hidden from the user.
[09:17:09] <timwis> What's the most popular jQuery plugin for doing CORS in IE?
[09:22:44] <termite> hackeron: are you trying to load each image one at a time or 20+ images all at once
[09:22:45] <termite> ?

[09:26:05] <hackeron> termite: I was thinking maybe load 4 images at a time? - and adjust this figure depending on what device is being used. I noticed the ipad doesn't like loading much more than 4 images at a time
[09:26:20] <Lope> err, I meant, whats wrong with this? <script type='text/javascript'>$(document).ready(function() {alert('hello');};</script>
[09:26:35] <xec_> termite: it is not a scope issue, it's a timing issue
[09:27:06] <termite> yeah you are right didn't catch that
[09:28:42] <Lope> nvm
[09:29:01] <termite> hackeron: I load them in one at a time in a series so when one finishes loading and calls the loaded event I make the next call
[09:29:18] <termite> it's not slow at all
[09:30:02] <Guest22681> hello there, can anybody help me with a small problem
[09:30:32] <Guest22681> i am trying to do a ajax request with an html link specefied by id
[09:30:53] <Guest22681> but it seems the html link isnt even gettink selected
[09:31:31] <hackeron> termite: how would I load 4 at a time?
[09:34:09] <MistuhKurtz> Guest22681, isolate the problem and create a jsfiddle and I would be happy to help
[09:34:29] <MistuhKurtz> since it's an AJAX request you'll need to use jsfiddle's AJAX API to make a dummy request/response
[09:36:17] <termite> hakeron:  This comes up all the time I should just create a fiddle for it
[09:36:55] <hackeron> termite: fiddle would be good :P
[09:37:07] <David_Bradbury> Is there a more elegant way of getting the DOM node from a jQuery selector than $("#foo")[0] or $("#foo").get(0)? Pointing the the first item when the selector is an ID seems unnecessary and looks kind of messy.
[09:37:34] <termite> hakeron: the basic concept is you bind to an img.onload and when it's done you pull the next image off the stack and repeat till the stack is empty
[09:37:37] <xec_> David_Bradbury: not that i know of
[09:37:51] <hackeron> termite: the stack is never empty
[09:37:56] <xec_> David_Bradbury: the [0] is succinct at least ;)
[09:38:03] <hackeron> termite: it needs to do this endlessly, so say 64 images endlessly reloading, 4 at a time
[09:38:43] <termite> then just make it a circular queue and shift from the top
[09:38:51] <David_Bradbury> Indeed
[09:39:57] <hackeron> termite: interesting - is there an easy way to make a circular queue in jquery?
[09:40:19] <hackeron> termite: say $('.livebox select option:selected').circular() or something?
[09:42:07] <termite> hackeron: i just use and array and when I .shift() I just .push() it back on to the end
[09:42:50] <hackeron> termite: ah, good idea
[09:43:03] <hackeron> termite: can maybe push it back in on error or on load - let me try :)
[09:43:20] <hackeron> termite: and then just call the worker function 4 times?
[09:44:29] <termite> hackeron: that is the basic you might have to mess around with it some
[09:44:59] <hackeron> termite: cool, thank you :) - it makes sense, trying to implement now
[09:46:11] <termite> hackeron: keep in mind that you are taking up 4 connections on your server or CDN (which would be better) . If the images are small I would suggest using image sprits or an image atlas.
[09:46:45] <termite> and send all 64 at once and chop them up client side
[09:46:48] <hackeron> termite: the images can be up to 5MP in size :P - typically 704x576
[09:47:32] <hackeron> termite: I was thinking maybe mjpeg to remove the request overheads, but don't think 64 x mjpeg images would have very good performance
[09:48:15] <termite> yeah unless you live in kansas city and are getting that sweet google fiber :)
[09:48:43] <hackeron> termite: not even that, browsers really don't seem to like more than a couple mjpegs on a page :)
[09:50:46] <termite> hackeron: are the images the same with just minor changes or are they completely different
[09:51:46] <hackeron> termite: normally very similar with minor changes, it's a CCTV system so it's from survaillance cameras. Ideally I'd want to use video, but different users have different cameras selected, so preparing every server side is not an option and again, say 32 video tags on a page == crashed browser, lol
[09:52:46] <hackeron> termite: also, video has latency (buffer till first keyint) and the servers are not powerful enough to transcode all the live feeds to the correct size and if you have 30 HD cameras, that's a problem
[09:55:02] <termite> hackeron: when you get the time look into node.js and html5 it's really easy to do video.  Though that is from a webcam
[10:03:41] <hackeron> termite: from 32 webcams? :P
[10:04:14] <mehrdad> anyone here worked with turn.js ?
[10:04:27] <mehrdad> i'm having trouble setting its direction rtl
[10:04:39] <mehrdad> so that the pages flip from right to left
[10:07:40] <hackeron> termite: I looked into HTTP Live Streaming and Flash Streaming and various streaming protocols like RTSP and what not - it boils down to having small chunks of video with a keyint every 1 or 2 seconds of various qualities and sizes - every vendor chooses these parameters. Problem is, this requires a *LOT* of processing power when you have say 64 live sources. Essentially you need to run x264 maybe 320 times, or at 8,000 fps. So this is the ...
[10:07:46] <hackeron> ... bottleneck, not the web facing stuff like node.js/html5 - considering a typical core i7 can run x264 at maybe 200fps, it's a problem to do that many live streams
[10:08:10] <mehrdad> anyone please? :/
[10:11:59] <hackeron> termite: but images are pretty cheap and low fps, considering I'm storing timelapse of 1 jpeg image per camera per second, I can fetch that and if it's already been fetched, request a jpeg from the IP camera directly - almost zero server overhead and a much closer "live" - not a video that's 5 seconds old, even if the framerate is low - I'd love to see a demo of maybe 16 video streams playing with popcorn js without crashing the browser :P
[10:14:30] <termite> hackeron: well ideally you would only have 4 running at once then but the node server would be pulling all 16 and you could asking to switch which camera streams where being sent to the client
[10:15:47] <termite> hackeron: so if no one is viewing 8 cameras their data just gets dumped.
[10:16:25] <hackeron> termite: how would you send 4 streams at a time? - the problem with h264 is if you stop sending data and then resume, you get a broken image until the next keyint
[10:17:01] <hackeron> termite: so you have to pretty much make sure that whatever h264 data is sent, is received in full - for that you need to transcode it to a size/quality the connection can handle
[10:18:03] <termite> hackeron: yeah I see your point
[10:19:24] <hackeron> termite: when you have h264 data from each camera coming at 3500kbit each and say you want to see 16 cameras in the browser, that's 56mbit/sec, heh - with images, you don't really care, get an image, resize is down, give it to the browser - it's not ideal but "good enough" - with video, hmm, transcode all that down but then I can't think of away to have the browser keep 16 connections open or someone get 16 streams from a single connection, ...
[10:19:30] <hackeron> ... but either way it will need to get the streams in full with no losses
[10:20:07] <mehrdad> dammit
[10:20:15] <mehrdad> the 3rd version doesn't support rtl properly
[10:20:27] <mehrdad> and the 4th version is not free :(
[10:21:19] <mehrdad> how the hell do i hack it to support rtl, i'm not skilled in jquery
[10:21:28] <mehrdad> this sucks
[10:21:34] <mehrdad> it's a total bummer
[10:22:03] <mehrdad> i was thinking i will get along with the free version and will try to implement the zoom feature somehow
[10:22:15] <mehrdad> but now this has gotten shitty
[10:28:58] <astropirate> mehrdad, that would be a CSS issue
[10:28:59] <astropirate> :)
[10:29:12] <mehrdad> are you sure?
[10:29:21] <mehrdad> have you worked with turn.js ?
[10:30:05] <mehrdad> it sucks real bad, because i was progressing nicely until i found the rtl thing
[10:30:09] <mehrdad> it really sucks
[10:30:23] <mehrdad> when the option is there and it just doesn't work
[10:30:33] <mehrdad> why the hell did he put it in there then
[10:30:37] <mehrdad> fuc k
[10:30:52] <mehrdad> the code base is huge
[10:31:09] <mehrdad> and i have not that much of expertise with jq to be able to work itout
[10:36:54] <wrapids> http://dpaste.org/6ZY9t/ Any ideas? Doesn't alert
[10:47:09] <ryanneufeld> wrapids: see ?ajax for the error callback functions, then you can see why it's not working
[10:47:09] <bot-t> wrapids, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:01:39] <skcin7> Hi jQuery people‚Ä¶ what's the best way to insert some HTML as the very first child of the body tag? like so: <body><div id="i_want_to_insert_code_here"></div><div id="rest_of_the_html_code"></div></body>
[11:02:09] <skcin7> Would that be $('body').prepend() ?
[11:02:38] <astropirate> yes
[11:02:42] <Eviltwin> ?prepend @ skcin7
[11:02:42] <bot-t> skcin7, .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[11:03:18] <skcin7> I thought so. Not working for me. Technical bug, I'll have to figure it out. Thanks astropirate, Eviltwin, bot-t
[11:05:45] <aaas> newbie question:  I would like to learn more about the '|| {}' construct in the line 'Drupal.highcharts = Drupal.highcharts || {};'  as you can immagine it's hard to google for this, what is this called, where can I get more info?
[11:07:11] <astropirate> aaas, ||  means  take whatever is on ethe left,   if it us  a falsy value ( 0, false, undefined, null)  then take whatever is on the right of it
[11:07:26] <astropirate> the thing on the right of it being an empty object
[11:07:40] <aaas> astropirate ah thanks
[11:08:05] <astropirate> thats so later on, when he checks  Drupal.highcharts.somValue    he isnt checking  somValue of an undefined property
[11:08:08] <astropirate> that would throw an error
[11:09:03] <aaas> astropirate one more thing...he also does somethihg that looks like drupal.behaviors.highcharts = charts: [] .... attach: ... detach: ....}  I've never seen 'attach:' or 'detach:' used like this, what is this called?
[11:09:23] <astropirate> ehhh
[11:09:28] <astropirate> thats called a syntax error
[11:09:29] <astropirate> lol
[11:09:40] <astropirate> can you pastie that part of the code please
[11:09:48] <aaas> astropirate yes searching
[11:09:49] <aaas> one sec
[11:09:53] <aaas> thanks btw
[11:10:10] <astropirate> no prob
[11:11:04] <aaas> astropirate http://drupalcode.org/project/highcharts.git/blob/refs/heads/7.x-2.x:/js/highcharts.js
[11:11:30] <aaas> astropirate im aware of what .attach() does but never seen this syntax before
[11:11:41] <Eviltwin> Oh God
[11:12:02] <Eviltwin> $.each($("selector", context).not("selector"), ...)
[11:12:22] <aaas> Eviltwin what's wrong?
[11:13:10] <Eviltwin> $(context).find("selector").not("selector").each(...) is faster and cleaner
[11:13:15] <astropirate> ahh aaa
[11:13:29] <aaas> Eviltwin ah
[11:13:29] <astropirate> aaas, he is just doing   Drupal.behaviors.highcharts = {
[11:13:29] <astropirate>    charts: [],
[11:13:42] <Eviltwin> I believe this attach and detach convention has to do with Drupal
[11:13:53] <aaas> ah
[11:14:17] <Eviltwin> aaas: http://drewish.com/content/2011/05/drupal_javascripting
[11:14:53] <aaas> ill read up...thanks astropirate Eviltwin

[11:16:11] <le_gars> hello hello, if I have some HEX colour codes that I would like to extract from a text string and then apply them to the DOM how should I go about?! The string contains some texts and comments and colour codes. I only want to grab the hex colour codes
[11:16:15] <le_gars> puh
[11:16:28] <le_gars> sorry for long explanation
[11:19:12] <macmartine> I'm trying to avoid jQuery conflicts in the case when jQuery is loaded but I require a newer version. So I call jQueryEg = window.jQuery.noConflict(true); -- but now I need to load jquery-ui as well, but it references $ when I now need to to reference jQueryEg. How can I do this?
[11:20:45] <Pietertje> has anyone used this ? http://www.xarg.org/project/jquery-webcam-plugin/
[11:21:34] <Eviltwin> makaimc_: It actually references window.jQuery, not window.$
[11:21:38] <Eviltwin> macmartine: ^
[11:22:38] <Eviltwin> I think the right solution is to make all your scripts use a closure to automatically copy the version of jQuery they need
[11:23:06] <Eviltwin> If you can modify the jQuery UI source, you can add (function(jQuery) { ... })(jQueryEg); around it
[11:23:43] <macmartine> Eviltwin: I was just reading about that. I'd rather not have to modify the source cause then I can't use a hosted version
[11:24:28] <danzik17> macmartine: you might be able to load your desired version of jQuery immediately followed by jQueryUI, THEN call $.noConflict, so jqUI extends the version you want.
[11:25:57] <macmartine> danzik17: I still get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ui' of undefined jquery-ui.min.js:5
[11:26:04] <Pietertje> has anyone used this ? http://www.xarg.org/project/jquery-webcam-plugin/
[11:26:04] <Pietertje> has anyone used this ? http://www.xarg.org/project/jquery-webcam-plugin/
[11:26:47] <le_gars> no I have not
[11:27:15] <RabSimpson> if i have 2 jQuery(document).ready(function($) { }); on the same page, should it cause a problem?
[11:27:59] <Pietertje> try it
[11:28:12] <danzik17> macmartine: if you make a jsfiddle with what you're trying to do, i'm sure someone would help take a look.
[11:31:25] <Eviltwin> macmartine: The best I can recommend is something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/EypcA/
[11:31:59] <Eviltwin> macmartine: The first <script> tag defines our first copy of jQuery (fake jQuery in this case)
[11:32:10] <Eviltwin> Then there's some code that uses this first version
[11:32:22] <Eviltwin> Then we want the second version for some piece of code
[11:32:29] <Eviltwin> We load it since it's not loaded yet
[11:32:40] <Eviltwin> Then immediately after have the script that uses it
[11:32:47] <Eviltwin> Then immediately after that we noConflict it
[11:32:59] <macmartine> Eviltwin: I have two versions of jQuery loaded and working, but what I can't figure out is how to load jquery-ui with my newly loaded jquery
[11:33:07] <Eviltwin> Then there's a script that needs the first version again
[11:33:32] <Eviltwin> macmartine: Are they being loaded dynamically or are they <script> tags in the HTML?
[11:35:19] <macmartine> Eviltwin: I'm writing out the script tag and waiting for it to load https://gist.github.com/3783606
[11:36:02] <le_gars> so did any one have any suggestions on how to extract hex colour values from a txt string and apply them to the DOM??
[11:36:58] <Eviltwin> Okay so what you need to do is var otherjQuery = window.jQuery; window.jQuery = jQueryEg; {{make and add jQuery UI script tag}}; script.onload = function() { window.jQuery = otherjQuery; };
[11:37:07] <Eviltwin> Essentially
[11:37:24] <Eviltwin> And make sure nothing else is tampering with window.jQuery in the mean time
[11:38:31] <macmartine> Eviltwin: I think I tried that. One sec
[11:39:44] <RabSimpson> pietertje i'm trying to work out where i'm going wrong
[11:39:59] <Eviltwin> le_gars: Use a regular expression
[11:40:10] <RabSimpson> pietertje i already have a page with 2 of them on it but i don't know if that's the problem
[11:40:46] <Pietertje>  jQuery(document).ready(function($) {alert('1'); });  jQuery(document).ready(function($) {alert('2'); });
[11:41:00] <Pietertje> im not gonna test it for ya..
[11:41:03] <RabSimpson> i'll give it a go
[11:41:04] <le_gars> yes I tried but the one I used just returns null when I tried it out
[11:42:53] <le_gars> anyone know one for matching hex values?
[11:42:58] <RabSimpson> pietertje it worked, one possibility down
[11:43:33] <Eviltwin> le_gars: http://jsfiddle.net/fKPtE/
[11:43:51] <Pietertje> ok
[11:44:07] <Pietertje> why you need 2 ?
[11:44:56] <le_gars> well thank you Eviltwin will try it out :)
[11:48:44] <macmartine> Eviltwin: Yes! Thank you!
[11:49:57] <Eviltwin> So it's critical that while that script is loading, nothing else tries to use window.jQuery or change window.jQuery (unless its expecting the jQueryEg version and/or sets window.jQuery to jQueryEg by the time the script loads)
[11:53:56] <RabSimpson> pietertje i don't *need* 2 but i need the functionality they both apply. they're being added to the page by different php functions.
[11:54:42] <RabSimpson> eviltwin elaine?
[12:00:25] <converge> is there a way to do it in jquery ? http://cl.ly/image/0U3h1l3y1W0B I wanna calc everytime the user input a quantity of products
[12:00:53] <Eviltwin> RabSimpson?
[12:01:07] <RabSimpson> eviltwin sorry, thought you were someone else.
[12:02:56] <ben_alman> For anyone interested, i wrote a pretty epic article about partial application in javascript https://twitter.com/cowboy/status/250656248784121857
[12:03:19] <Eviltwin> Love partial application
[12:03:27] <Eviltwin> Actually, let me see if I still have my evil code somewhere
[12:06:14] <ryanneufeld> ?click
[12:06:14] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[12:10:07] <le_gars> Eviltwin: cheers for the help. Works nice and dandy
[12:10:36] <Eviltwin> ben_alman: Check out this evil: https://gist.github.com/ae5c202ee2492a07d701
[12:12:07] <Eviltwin> Actually I think splice is like your partialAny
[12:14:58] <arielserafini> what do you guys think of "namespaced" class names in css? like .myPlugin-something instead of just .something ?
[12:15:19] <astropirate> arielserafini, definatly do
[12:15:35] <arielserafini> it looks ugly as hell, but i'm super wary of interfering with other stuff on the page
[12:15:49] <astropirate> yah thats what is important
[12:15:51] <arielserafini> so yeah, ty for input astropirate
[12:15:55] <astropirate> np
[12:15:56] <Eviltwin> If you're writing a plugin, absolutely use namespaces
[12:16:07] <arielserafini> I just needed some peer validation
[12:16:10] <arielserafini> :P
[12:16:24] <Eviltwin> If you're writing a page and you know that your class names will never be used elsewhere
[12:16:27] <Eviltwin> It's up to you
[12:16:29] <astropirate> arielserafini, can we peer pressure you into doing insane things?
[12:16:36] <Eviltwin> But a plugin is being used in an unknown environment
[12:16:38] <arielserafini> astropirate, probably
[12:16:50] <arielserafini> Eviltwin, yup, I agree
[12:18:09] <Eviltwin> ben_alman: So Function.prototype.splice lets you replace and insert arguments while Function.prototype.slice lets you reorder arguments
[12:18:41] <ben_alman> yeah
[12:18:47] <ben_alman> seems like it has pretty limited real-world use
[12:19:31] <ben_alman> Eviltwin: let me know what you think of my article
[12:20:38] <Eviltwin> ben_alman: I think it's only really useful if you're trying to twist one method signature to match another
[12:20:50] <ben_alman> right
[12:21:18] <Eviltwin> But that could easily be done via function(a,b,c,d,e) { return foo(c,d,b,a,b); } etc
[12:21:26] <ben_alman> sure
[12:21:42] <ben_alman> when dealing with argument reordering it's likely that you have a finite number of arguments
[12:23:22] <macmartine> How do I test if the query datepicker class is loaded
[12:24:27] <Eviltwin> ben_alman: I'll give your article a read later this afternoon
[12:24:38] <Eviltwin> I skimmed it and there's definitely lots of good, cool stuff in there
[12:24:43] <macmartine> ah, nevermind
[12:26:15] <Widgets> Hi is there in way to preload the datastor for each ui dialog before page is fully loaded?
[12:28:28] <Widgets> let me rephrase the question; is there anyway to preload jquery's DOM Datastor for each dialog we have?
[12:30:16] <converge> I have this situation http://paste2.org/p/2266641 how can I set an ID for <b>1</b> this number ?
[12:31:23] <ezrafree> hello
[12:31:35] <Eviltwin> converge: $("li b").attr("id", "mybidgoeshere")
[12:31:55] <Eviltwin> Widgets: I don't understand what you mean
[12:31:59] <razzi> i think he means .. <b id="aNumber"></b>
[12:32:02] <ezrafree> is there any way to make twitter bootstrap's accordian work even if there's a form outside of the elements?
[12:32:29] <converge> razzi: you're right, can I do that ? <b id=".."> ?
[12:32:51] <Zzaichik> attr('id', $('b').val());
[12:33:08] <Zzaichik> .text();
[12:33:34] <star_prone> Hi
[12:33:46] <Zzaichik> converge:  .attr('id', $('b').text());  If I understand you correctly.
[12:34:06] <Eviltwin> That seems like an unusual interpretation to me
[12:34:09] <Eviltwin> But perhaps not
[12:34:16] <star_prone> what does this code do: jquery('option', _this)...
[12:34:28] <Zzaichik> yeah i dont think i get it
[12:34:38] <star_prone> I don't know what the comma does
[12:34:56] <converge> Im a bit confuse. I have this number <b>11</b> I wanna change it using jquery, but the number dont have an element id or something to be refered
[12:34:56] <Zzaichik> separator
[12:35:12] <Eviltwin> I believe he wants this: http://jsfiddle.net/4B6qB/
[12:35:16] <Eviltwin> converge: ^
[12:35:58] <Zzaichik> Eviltwin: ahh yes. that makes more sense.
[12:35:59] <converge> Eviltwin: exactly, but in this way every bold element will be changed
[12:36:52] <converge> Im asking myself how to set and id for this specific data, in this case <b>11</b>
[12:37:12] <converge> *an id
[12:38:02] <le_gars> Eviltwin: had one question about the regex you helped me with. It seems as though it can only get the first hex values of the string
[12:38:45] <Eviltwin> converge: http://jsfiddle.net/4B6qB/1/
[12:39:45] <converge> Eviltwin: thanks !!
[12:39:56] <le_gars> I have 8 hex values in the string. Tried looping over the string and outputting but I can only grab the first value. Need to modify the regex so that I can fetch them all
[12:40:01] <someprimetime> so i've got an object creation question‚Ä¶ i'm trying to put each of these <ul> children (all list elements which aren't the parent category) into an object, but it's adding : childName: "Cat EyeColorful EyeEyebrowsEyeLlashes" .. etc.. I want to instead have a key value for each of them http://jsfiddle.net/WP5sh/
[12:40:10] <someprimetime> scope out the console for the obj
[12:40:44] <Eviltwin> le_gars: http://jsfiddle.net/96taS/
[12:40:59] <someprimetime> i tried doing something like childName[i] : childName but I get `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier `
[12:41:30] <Widgets> I have 30 dialog widgets on a page some are programmed as autoOpen: false but jquery opens each dialog box to find out it's settings when it finds out it is suppose to be closed, then it closes it!! Really there has to be a better way than opening the door to find out if it is suppose to be closed??
[12:41:34] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: An object literal can't have variables as keys
[12:41:41] <le_gars> hahah, ok I get the hint. Thanks for your help.
[12:41:48] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: is there any way to nest this further?
[12:42:02] <FLeiXiuS> Im using $.ajax to POST, the response text is blank but the status is a 200 OK in console.  How can I get this status code,  I've tried the jqXHR object and the statusCode method.
[12:42:22] <someprimetime> object literal as in {} opposed to new Object()?
[12:42:31] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I don't understand what this is supposed to look like
[12:42:51] <Eviltwin> No I mean var o = {a: b}; as opposed to var o = {}; a['a'] = b;
[12:43:07] <Eviltwin> The latter allows you to do var o = {}; a[myFavoriteVariable] = b;
[12:43:10] <Eviltwin> The former does not
[12:44:55] <Zzaichik> converge: Eviltwin, this is what I thought you were trying to do. http://jsfiddle.net/4B6qB/4/
[12:45:19] <Eviltwin> That's insane
[12:45:32] <Eviltwin> But w/e
[12:45:59] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: expected: http://pastebin.com/1FGyfEMZ
[12:46:02] <converge> wasnt exactly it but thanks anyway
[12:46:15] <danheberden> twss
[12:47:24] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: At the point where liChildren is constructed, I only see one childName
[12:47:43] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: right, but i wasn't able to add the index with the object literal version
[12:48:07] <someprimetime> but i'd ideally like to have them just indexed with [index] : "Looks"
[12:48:09] <Eviltwin> How about you write the broken code you were trying to write
[12:48:14] <Eviltwin> That didn't work
[12:48:24] <Eviltwin> And maybe that'll clue me in to what you're trying to do
[12:48:30] <Eviltwin> Because I still don't really undersatnd
[12:48:35] <someprimetime> ok
[12:49:00] <Eviltwin> I get the idea that you want dynamic keys
[12:49:02] <Eviltwin> But not why
[12:50:22] <FLeiXiuS> I'm trying to do an AJAX post, firebug console says 200 OK - how can I get that status code in javascript?
[12:51:00] <Eviltwin> FLeiXiuS: Look at the jqXHR object: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax
[12:51:12] <FLeiXiuS> Eviltwin: Did that - status is always set to 0 and text is always error.
[12:51:52] <Eviltwin> Then either the request hasn't completed at that point or it was actually an error
[12:51:55] <Eviltwin> ?ajax101 @ FLeiXiuS
[12:51:56] <bot-t> FLeiXiuS, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[12:53:11] <FLeiXiuS> Eviltwin: That wouldnt make sense using the ajax:complete  callback
[12:53:16] <NackNick> can someone help me for a sec, im trying to pass values to another page with a dropdown when its selected but when I select the option on the drop down it doesnt pass the value, im using this window.open(this.options[this.selectedIndex].title,'_top') you can see the live problem here.... http://jsfiddle.net/c4AwF/
[12:54:54] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: http://i.imgur.com/Bb4Tj.png
[12:55:11] <someprimetime> from this current code: http://jsfiddle.net/WP5sh/
[12:55:19] <someprimetime> that desired output would be on the right pane
[12:55:48] <Eviltwin> Where does "CatEyeColorful EyeEyebrows..." come from?
[12:55:55] <ezrafree> where would the proper place be to find support for twitter bootstrap? is there any?
[12:56:15] <Eviltwin> Oh, $(el).find('.filter_child a') returns more than one thing?
[12:56:29] <Eviltwin> ezrafree: Not here as far as I know
[12:56:35] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: $('.js-filter-group').find('.filter_dropdown .filter_child a').text())
[12:56:40] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah
[12:56:44] <ezrafree> Eviltwin: no worries, thanks for the input
[12:56:58] <someprimetime> sorry i should have made that more obvious
[12:57:00] <someprimetime> those are dropdown menus
[12:58:16] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/WP5sh/1/
[12:58:22] <Eviltwin> How about that?
[12:58:43] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: it's beautiful
[12:58:49] <someprimetime> thanks now i can do that for a bunch of other stuff
[12:58:53] <someprimetime> you rocko man
[12:58:57] <someprimetime> s/cko/ck
[12:59:12] <someprimetime> so i just put an empty object in w/in data
[12:59:28] <Eviltwin> So if there are no children
[12:59:33] <Eviltwin> liChildren will be an empty object
[12:59:50] <someprimetime> that's even better too since there is that case
[12:59:53] <Eviltwin> Otherwise each child gets added with "childName"+i where is the index in $(el).find('.filter_child a')
[13:00:42] <someprimetime> thanks so much. i'm working on a <ul> => <select> plugin atm
[13:00:51] <someprimetime> if you were wondering wtf i'm even doing this
[13:01:17] <callumacrae> I keep misreading "#jquery" as "#regex" and getting really confused
[13:01:18] <callumacrae> dammit
[13:02:52] <Matt_P> callumacrae: that's quite the misread.,,
[13:03:13] <callumacrae> Hey, at least I don't miss the . key!
[13:03:20] <fearphage> i want to select all elements up to a certain point. is there  a built in way to do that? the end point is either the current element or one with a specific class. i'm looking at the API and I don't see anything
[13:03:46] <Eviltwin> fearphage: Not something like http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[13:03:54] <Pilate> fearphage: if the elements youd like to select all reside in the same element, you can select off the parent
[13:08:13] <fearphage> Eviltwin: that sounds about right but i need 2 stopping points. i think i may have to find out which one is furth along and then use nextUntil. thanks
[13:08:22] <fearphage> Pilate: i'm selecting off the parent now
[13:15:40] <ryanneufeld> ?each
[13:15:40] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:16:27] <EweR> what is a good alternative to thickbox for displaying html in a modal box?
[13:18:05] <Eviltwin> fearphage: You'll probably want something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/taBKE/
[13:19:54] <Pessimism> if I get an Origin Null error, how should this GET-based AJAX request be altered: http://dpaste.com/805921/
[13:22:54] <niceguy> Im trying to downlaod jquery
[13:23:12] <niceguy> but everytime i downlaod it just takes me to a new page with code in it
[13:23:28] <Eviltwin> ?sop @ Pessimism
[13:23:28] <bot-t> Pessimism, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[13:23:38] <callumacrae> niceguy: Yes, that is jQuery
[13:23:54] <niceguy> so how do i use it
[13:24:11] <niceguy> callumacre: so how do i use it
[13:24:38] <callumacrae> niceguy: Do you know how to use JavaScript itself?
[13:24:53] <niceguy> callumacrae: Somewhat
[13:25:14] <callumacrae> Save the file as jquery.min.js and treat it as a normal JS file, then
[13:25:50] <niceguy> callumacrae: Thats the thing how do i save the file, copy and paste?
[13:30:41] <albemuth> Hi, I'm looking for a reliable way for get the value of a text input inside of its keypress callback, just calling $(e.target()).val() doesn't really work because it omits the last char you typed and doesn't update correctly with delete/backspace
[13:32:04] <callumacrae> niceguy: Yes, I guess
[13:32:32] <niceguy> callumacrae: Just did that
[13:33:35] <fearphage> Eviltwin: thanks. i ended up going with $foo.slice(0, Math.max($foo.index(this), $foo.index('.selected:last'));
[13:34:33] <Eviltwin> They're both ugly and probably sub-optimal in speed but that one's less code
[13:35:06] <fearphage> yes, I agree. thanks for the help though
[13:35:42] <arielserafini> anyone willing to criticize the plugin I just made?
[13:35:53] <Eviltwin> Just post it and ask for comments
[13:35:55] <fearphage> it sucks
[13:35:58] <fearphage> i hate it
[13:36:02] <arielserafini> fearphage, :(
[13:36:05] <fearphage> do i have to look at the code first?
[13:36:05] <arielserafini> https://github.com/arielserafini/jquery.lineman
[13:36:10] <Pessimism> is my best bet to rely on a getJSON() call, then?
[13:36:24] <Eviltwin> It be good to know what it's supposed to do
[13:36:29] <Eviltwin> It'd*
[13:37:07] <arielserafini> it's supposed to separate multiline text into lines
[13:37:15] <arielserafini> adding a span around each line
[13:37:49] <arielserafini> djsounds02 was asking for something like this yesterday, so I decided to make this into a plugin
[13:39:31] <Eviltwin> Well I can nitpick a few things I guess
[13:39:55] <Eviltwin> Either do var ..., i, ...; and for ( i = 1; ...
[13:39:57] <arielserafini> please do
[13:40:04] <Eviltwin> Or change it to for( ; ...
[13:40:16] <Eviltwin> The for ( i ; ... adds a useless expression
[13:40:18] <Eviltwin> IMO
[13:40:31] <arielserafini> makes total sense, I missed that
[13:40:46] <Eviltwin> Second, I would make the class names customizable
[13:41:13] <Eviltwin> Third, I would definitely have a way to undo this
[13:41:47] <Eviltwin> Fourth, unless it's extremely clearly documented that its unsupported, I would try to support HTML
[13:42:08] <Eviltwin> If I have <div>Hello, <b>World!</b></div> and I run this, I'll lose my style
[13:42:22] <arielserafini> yeah
[13:42:37] <arielserafini> that's on my "roadmap"
[13:42:41] <Eviltwin> Fifth, and this is coming from the computer scientist in me, I would try to use a binary search instead of a linear search
[13:42:55] <Eviltwin> If I have <div>a a a a a a a a a a a a a ...</div> and a super wide browser window
[13:43:16] <Eviltwin> You're going to effectively add one letter at a time until it wraps
[13:43:33] <walidvb> do i risk to break something by doing a $('.big-images img').hide().load(function(){$(this).fadeIn()})? it seems not all images always load?
[13:43:54] <walidvb> (it's in document ready)
[13:44:18] <arielserafini> Eviltwin, sadly I never had formal CS lessons
[13:44:22] <arielserafini> I'll look into that
[13:44:42] <Eviltwin> The idea is simple
[13:44:51] <arielserafini> really appreciate you taking the time to comment on my code
[13:44:53] <Eviltwin> Measure how high the line is with one word
[13:45:02] <Eviltwin> Then guess that half the words could fit on one line
[13:45:17] <arielserafini> and then decrease from that?
[13:45:20] <arielserafini> if it doesnt fit?
[13:45:23] <Eviltwin> If the height is too tall, guess that 25% of the words could fit on one line otherwise guess that 75% of the words could fit on one line
[13:45:37] <arielserafini> that's great logic
[13:45:48] <Eviltwin> And then you proceed from ther
[13:45:49] <Eviltwin> e
[13:45:54] <Eviltwin> Once you've finished your first line, you repeat
[13:46:04] <arielserafini> awesome
[13:46:10] <arielserafini> I'll definitely implement that
[13:46:25] <walidvb> arg my question is lost :D
[13:46:35] <Eviltwin> Essentially you start by knowing that the line should contain somewhere between 0% and 100% of the words
[13:46:42] <Eviltwin> So you guess the midpoint and measure
[13:47:00] <Eviltwin> At which point you will end up with the range 0% - 50% or 50% - 100%
[13:47:05] <Eviltwin> and you guess the midpoint again
[13:47:32] <Eviltwin> Until you range consists of exactly 1 word
[13:47:39] <Eviltwin> At which point you've found where it should break
[13:48:44] <arielserafini> Eviltwin, thanks a bunch :D
[13:50:28] <Eviltwin> Also it looks like you can just do var ..., currentHeight; instead of var ..., currentHeight = $this.height();
[13:50:38] <Eviltwin> The first thing you do inside your loop is overwrite it
[13:50:57] <Eviltwin> You probably want line 28 of jquery.lineman.js to be height = $this.height();
[13:51:05] <arielserafini> yes but it's used before the loop
[13:51:05] <Eviltwin> To measure the height of just the first word
[13:51:07] <arielserafini> as well
[13:51:17] <Eviltwin> Where?
[13:51:24] <arielserafini> well, line 28
[13:51:35] <arielserafini> ah, right
[13:51:37] <arielserafini> you're correct
[13:51:54] <arielserafini> preemptive optimization "(
[13:51:57] <arielserafini> :(
[13:53:45] <Eviltwin> Also where is the closing bracket of your for()?
[13:54:02] <Eviltwin> It should be right after the closing bracket for the if()
[13:54:18] <arielserafini> line 45
[13:54:33] <Eviltwin> Og indentation
[13:54:34] <arielserafini> it's not because i want to add the word to finalHtml
[13:54:37] <Eviltwin> Oh indentation*
[13:54:47] <Eviltwin> It's aligned with the opening if
[13:54:50] <arielserafini> ST2 is messing with it
[13:55:03] <arielserafini> some things get misindented
[13:58:17] <arielserafini> fixed it
[13:58:49] <lesf> Hi all, is anybody else reporting inability to access the API pages using IE9?  Various page links on the site raise a prompt to "open or save" instead of loading the page.  The open option fails to recognize the content as well
[13:59:20] <arielserafini> lesf, checking
[13:59:40] <walidvb> do i risk to break something by doing a $('.big-images img').hide().load(function(){$(this).fadeIn()})? it seems not all images always load?
[13:59:44] <walidvb> (it's in document ready)
[14:00:03] <Eviltwin> walidvb: I don't know what you mean bt "break something"
[14:00:13] <arielserafini> walidvb, I *think* images will not get loaded if they are not visible
[14:00:16] <Eviltwin> If the image has already loaded by the time you do that
[14:00:20] <Eviltwin> You won't get another load event
[14:00:21] <walidvb> Eviltwin: hm sry i didn't mean break, rather "not work"
[14:00:25] <Eviltwin> So it will be hidden but never shown
[14:00:41] <Eviltwin> You should do that right when the images are added to the DOM
[14:01:11] <walidvb> oh you mean if the image is loaded already before the code is run? is that possible?
[14:01:21] <arielserafini> lesf, which links are doing that?
[14:01:28] <Eviltwin> Completely depends on when the code is run
[14:01:30] <Eviltwin> Which you haven't told us
[14:02:16] <lesf> Quite a few, e.g. if I go to Attributes I can open .prop ,but the links below that fail, such as .removeAttr
[14:02:47] <walidvb> Eviltwin: sorry, run on $(document).ready
[14:03:34] <arielserafini> lesf, works for me
[14:03:56] <lesf> yeah, works in firefox for me, works in my IE9 at home
[14:04:05] <lesf> Not concerned if its a bug/config/whatever in my IE9, more concerned that it may be affecting other users of the site, but then I have not found any sign of other complaints about this
[14:05:13] <walidvb> Eviltwin: http://www.and-one.ch/project/research-center for example
[14:13:07] <arielserafini> walidvb, please make a jsfiddle with the relevant parts of your code only
[14:13:13] <krishna_> can any one let me know how i should bind data to list box using jquery
[14:13:16] <arielserafini> it's a lot easier for us to help you then
[14:13:26] <walidvb> arielserafini: my code is
[14:13:58] <walidvb> $('.proj-pictures img').hide().load(function(){$(this).fadeIn()})? it seems not all images always load?
[14:14:03] <Eviltwin> krishna_: http://www.jqwidgets.com/tag/jquery-listbox-2/ or http://aloksah.org/2011/02/27/list-box-manipulation/
[14:14:29] <walidvb> oops sry. anyway, i can't repeat the error, just sometimes the first slides don't fade in
[14:14:38] <arielserafini> ?demo @ walidvb
[14:14:41] <bot-t> walidvb, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:15:33] <arielserafini> walidvb, please use http://jsfiddle.net, it's awesome
[14:15:37] <krishna_> thank u eviltwin
[14:15:43] <walidvb> arielserafini: 1. the error probably won't occur on a jsfiddle. 2. i do have a live demo working
[14:16:01] <Eviltwin> Can you at least isolate?
[14:16:07] <Eviltwin> Just pull out the relevant elements and dump them in body
[14:16:15] <Eviltwin> Then get rid of everything else
[14:16:20] <walidvb> ..sure :)
[14:16:21] <Eviltwin> And only have the snippet of code you're talking about
[14:16:29] <Eviltwin> ?jdb
[14:16:29] <bot-t> We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[14:16:49] <arielserafini> it's personal preference, but i'd MUCH rather look at a fiddle than having to inspect and view source
[14:17:04] <Eviltwin> I normally refuse to look at anything that's not in a jsFiddle
[14:17:20] <Eviltwin> So unless it's a damn convenient non-jsFiddle
[14:17:23] <Eviltwin> I'm probably not going to help you
[14:17:26] <arielserafini> hahaha
[14:17:43] <arielserafini> you know
[14:17:46] <arielserafini> it's one of those things
[14:17:55] <arielserafini> I don't know how we managed to do stuff without it
[14:18:05] <arielserafini> well, it's not as dramatic as say Firebug/dev tools
[14:18:08] <arielserafini> but
[14:18:09] <arielserafini> damn
[14:18:23] <krishna_> how can i load a list box dynamically in jquery
[14:18:40] <arielserafini> krishna_, what's a list box?
[14:19:09] <Eviltwin> krishna_: I don't use jQWidgets and neither do most people here
[14:19:50] <walidvb> Eviltwin: arielserafini: hm it's really messy to transfer to jsfiddle, seeing as that is a cycle as well
[14:20:12] <Eviltwin> krishna_: Please read this: http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-documentation/documentation/jqxlistbox/jquery-listbox-getting-started.htm
[14:20:31] <walidvb> but do you also have, if you visit a project on http://www.and-one.ch/ that some slides are hidden?
[14:21:18] <Eviltwin> My suspicion is that you have a conflict of some kind
[14:21:29] <Eviltwin> Hence why I've been asking you to isolate
[14:21:30] <Eviltwin> Please isolate
[14:21:44] <ezrafree> cd /Users/303software ;
[14:24:11] <walidvb> Eviltwin: :) unfortunately i don't have the time to include all plugins into the jsfiddle. it just seems weird to me, because sometimes all images are there, sometime 1 is missing, sometimes 3, i can't really tell.
[14:24:49] <walidvb> but i'll try a bit more right now before i stop for today, then come back case i don't find a solution. if you have a smart guess i'll take it though :)
[14:25:37] <Eviltwin> My smart guess is that there's a race condition
[14:25:42] <Eviltwin> Two pieces of code that can run in either order
[14:25:50] <Eviltwin> And when they run in one order it works and when they run in the other order it breaks
[14:34:09] <Pessimism> I've tried both the suggestions outlined in this SO (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2414899/why-isnt-jquery-automatically-appending-the-jsonp-callback), but none have fixed my SOP problem here: http://dpaste.com/805921/. What am I doing wrong?
[14:34:33] <Pessimism> specifying callback and using JSONP calls and queries doesn't work
[14:35:12] <walidvb> Eviltwin: cheers. i think i know where to look. probably in drupal.behaviours
[14:35:44] <Eviltwin> Just because an API supports JSON doesn't mean it supports JSONP
[14:37:18] <Pessimism> or maybe I'm just messing up something else in my code. The SOP error is gone, but nothing is shown. So it goes.
[14:41:42] <hip2p> When a user goes to one of my pages, I want to populate the page with html that is configured based on information in a mysql database. Which line would you use in the <script>? Would it be $(document).ready()? or would load() make more sense?
[14:43:20] <Eviltwin> $(document).read
[14:43:20] <Eviltwin> y
[14:44:34] <hip2p> ok thanks
[14:57:46] <bigLanky_> i am looking to hire someone to help build a slider - here is what it looks like: http://i46.tinypic.com/zxpkxc.png  <--- the functionality is as follows:   5 items are entered total, clicking the arrows will shift each item 1 position and the ends will wrap, autoscroll after 3 seconds, image (statue) needs to rotate with the images as well.
[14:57:57] <bigLanky_> anyon eknow if this is possible to do? or would anyone be interested in building this out? I can pay
[15:00:21] <bigLanky> http://dwight.team4.ciplex.com/ <--- this shows what i have so far. I used a module called timeliner http://www.csslab.cl/2011/08/18/jquery-timelinr/ but I can't get it to wrap
[15:00:37] <bigLanky> i can simply replace the scrolling text with an image, but just need to get this thing to wrap
[15:03:45] <foertel1> hey ‚Ä¶
[15:04:12] <foertel1> could it be, $(form).submit() does not actually trigger the submit() eventHandler?
[15:06:03] <arielserafini> bigLanky, did you place your js code inside the timelinr file?
[15:06:22] <arielserafini> or what?
[15:06:47] <bigLanky> ya
[15:06:49] <bigLanky> 1 sec
[15:06:51] <bigLanky> ill grab them
[15:08:40] <bigLanky> http://pastebin.com/jrtXFHga
[15:29:36] <Biomech> any reason why this won't work in IE?   $('#quickContactNoticeBox').hide().fadeIn(2500);
[15:31:40] <Zzaichik> what the..
[15:32:03] <Zzaichik> you should do display: none in CSS and the drop the .hide();
[15:32:10] <Zzaichik> then*
[15:32:10] <Biomech> yeah tried that
[15:32:11] <KWhat_Work> When i call option disabled true on a widget, it adds disabled classes to my widget.  Where does that disabled class get added?
[15:32:17] <Biomech> it all works in everything else, just not in IE
[15:32:43] <KWhat_Work> Biomech: just forget ie.
[15:32:43] <Zzaichik> Camel Casing matches exactly in HTML, JS and CSS?
[15:32:53] <Biomech> hehe i can't :P
[15:32:58] <Biomech> id love to
[15:34:24] <Biomech> i hear it clicking, it goes click, clickclick
[15:34:31] <Biomech> you know, that really annoying IE refresh clicking
[15:35:03] <Zzaichik> Biomech: maybe check this article out. http://bit.ly/VEBOQv
[15:35:12] <Biomech> thanks ill have a read
[15:38:01] <Zzaichik> It basically says to do a shitload more stuff to get it to work properly.
[15:38:13] <Biomech> lol ok it's nto the jq
[15:38:31] <Biomech> its just not showing the data at all
[15:38:35] <Biomech> which is wtf
[15:38:53] <Zzaichik> it's an opacity issue, from what I gather.
[15:39:20] <Biomech> well now ive set it to basic php if this error, blast out this box
[15:39:28] <Biomech> which works in everything but IE
[15:39:37] <Biomech> but i hear a double refresh in IE
[15:43:57] <aaas> i want to export a table from the database as csv,  there are several guides of how to do this with php/mysql online, id like to run this with an onclick event on some image.  Could someone point me in the right direction or the right functions that I could do some reading to acomplish this.  I'm assuming this would be ajax?
[15:47:16] <Eviltwin> aaas: I think it would actually work more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ZTs3G/show/
[15:47:20] <Eviltwin> Except perhaps with a post
[15:47:41] <Biomech> this is insane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[15:47:54] <Biomech> view src in chrome, the error data is there, view src in IE, it's not
[15:47:55] <newcode> on an ipad, when a user does a touchmove and enters a div, I want to trigger an action - how can I do that?
[15:48:14] <aaas> Eviltwin thanks can i do it without the refresh...i want to do it in a ajax-y way
[15:48:53] <Eviltwin> This opens it in a new window and your page is left where it is
[15:49:35] <aaas> Eviltwin ah ok so in that open page code is where I would put my code to fetch the csv from the database?
[15:49:54] <aaas> Eviltwin sorry if that sounds ignorant, I'll do more reading, jus ttrying to get my head wrapped around the idea
[15:50:09] <Eviltwin> Can you make a URL that generates the appropriate CSV?
[15:50:35] <aaas> Eviltwin hmm maybe, I'd like to do a direct call to the database if possible
[15:50:51] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:50:53] <Eviltwin> This is the part that needs to be done in PHP
[15:50:57] <Eviltwin> I suggest speaking to #php or ##php
[15:51:12] <aaas> Eviltwin yes I think I can handel the php stuff, the ajax is the hard part for me :)
[15:51:28] <aaas> Eviltwin yeah ill keep reading up...I'm starting to get an idea though...thanks for your help
[15:51:59] <aaas> Eviltwin maybe something like this? http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/107
[15:52:25] <Biomech> seriously wtf, how does IE not display server genwerated code that it is given?
[15:54:45] <Eviltwin> aaas: Create a PHP page that access the database and makes a CSV
[15:54:52] <Eviltwin> AJAX directly to the database doesn't work
[15:55:19] <aaas> Eviltwin ah ok... yeah I think i said that wrong..what I meant was a non-URL route
[15:55:38] <Eviltwin> There no non-URL route
[15:56:17] <aaas> Eviltwin ok maybe i mean I didn't want to put the csv in a visible url
[15:56:44] <Eviltwin> Okay...but the page is going to be in a visible URL?
[15:58:09] <aaas> well i didn't want to refresh the page mainly or change the url shown in the address bar so the page will be 99% (or 100%?) static basically so the server call would be served in an ajax fashion
[15:58:32] <aaas> Eviltwin I probably just don't know ajax well enough to understand how it works ;)
[15:58:50] <aaas> Eviltwin but maybe the code on that page would get me most of the way
[15:59:02] <Eviltwin> Sure...maybe...
[16:00:00] <aaas> Eviltwin ill look into it, thanks again
[16:16:28] <CapMax> hi, if i make a new function inside a click() for an element, is there a way to reference it elsewhere?
[16:16:59] <vinmassaro> Anyone know if it is possible to pass a specific PHP function as the source of my autocomplete, as opposed to just the entire PHP file?
[16:17:47] <shalotelli> if you do $("#element").click(element_click);
[16:17:57] <shalotelli> then function element_click(param)
[16:18:16] <shalotelli> you can call the function wherever you want
[16:18:44] <shalotelli> so you're calling the function from the click event
[16:20:18] <Dr4g> Hey guys, my app has an iframe that defines the 'table of contents' data and from the parent i'm going to pull them up into the parent and update some divs on the main frame.
[16:20:52] <Dr4g> Which format should i store this data, JSON data? and then json decode it on the parent and update some parent divs.
[16:26:01] <CapMax> shalotelli: is there a way to define the function from within click() itself in such a way that i could refer to it later?
[16:27:12] <shalotelli> i don't know actually! maybe if you created a variable outside the scope of the click and then within it you assigned the variable to a function?
[16:27:19] <shalotelli>  
[16:27:35] <CapMax> sounds shifty, i like it :D
[16:27:59] <shalotelli> lol let me know if it works
[17:01:17] <Dr4g> console.log($('.contents iframe').contents().find('div'));
[17:01:24] <Dr4g> this gives me back nothing
[17:01:33] <Dr4g> console.log($('.contents iframe').contents()); -- this gives me back #document (which is valid)
[17:02:01] <Dr4g> so i can select the iframe's DOM just fine, but can't select anything inside it
[17:02:46] <Dr4g> I got it - i done: jQuery('.contents iframe').load(function() {
[17:06:23] <viktor-bjorn> Hello http://jsfiddle.net/MfRer/ need to go back on directory as the image i need is in img but it always adds the ../js/ when i need ../ + img
[17:08:29] <coldhead> viktor-bjorn: http://jsfiddle.net/MfRer/1/ ?
[17:12:19] <viktor-bjorn> ../js../img/image.png"
[17:12:40] <viktor-bjorn> i need ../img/image.png
[17:52:17] <MistuhKurtz> when you chain jquery methods with no selector, is it returning the window object?
[17:52:48] <coldhead> you mean like $() ?
[17:53:37] <MistuhKurtz> coldhead, like $.method().anotherMethod();
[17:54:13] <coldhead> i've never used that
[17:54:24] <coldhead> those methods don't necessarily return jQuery wrapped sets
[17:54:30] <coldhead> so you can't necessarily chain them
[17:54:49] <coldhead> like, .method() needs to return an object with a method anotherMethod() for that to work
[17:55:07] <MistuhKurtz> well I just realized I had chained two plugins with no selector
[17:55:08] <MistuhKurtz> and it's working
[17:55:12] <MistuhKurtz> so i was just wondering why :)
[17:56:13] <Nacho___> hi.. im trying to load a datapicker through ajax.. is something wrong with this code? http://pastie.org/4800845
[17:56:30] <MistuhKurtz> the first plugin is stellar.js, for adding parallax scrolling effects to a page (using no selector looks through the whole document, and unfortunately I can't seem to get it working right when i do use a selector)
[17:56:42] <MistuhKurtz> the second plugin that gets chained after that is for binding touch events
[17:57:51] <Nacho___> im getting TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'datepicker' in the browser
[18:02:49] <coldhead> Nacho___: that sounds like you are not loading the datepicker script successfully
[18:03:04] <coldhead> can you see it in the web inspector/firebug network tab?
[18:03:11] <coldhead> with status 200?
[18:03:14] <coldhead> OK
[18:03:49] <Nacho___> coldhead:  look http://pastie.org/4800875
[18:05:17] <coldhead> Nacho___: load jQuery before UI
[18:05:23] <coldhead> UI extends jQuery
[18:05:30] <coldhead> needs to have jQuery loaded first to extend it
[18:07:10] <Nacho___> coldhead:  cool.. thanks.. but why im not getting the syiling
[18:07:14] <Nacho___> styles
[18:07:31] <coldhead> are you loading the UI CSS
[18:07:47] <Nacho___> umm
[18:07:53] <Nacho___> i guess not
[18:17:50] <Pasq89> im replacing a div, with a new div, and it contains php.. and it converts php code to html comment.. any solution?
[18:18:36] <Pasq89> like this $('#theID').replaceWith('<div><?php echo "lala"; ?> </div> ');
[18:19:21] <Pasq89> this turns out in: <!-- php echo "lala"; ? --> . any solution?
[18:24:17] <rmurphey> [/names
[18:24:20] <rmurphey> erp
[18:31:21] <coldhead> Pasq89: PHP runs on the web server
[18:31:27] <coldhead> jQUery runs in the browser
[18:31:57] <coldhead> if you want to do something with PHP code in the browser you have to use AJAX to request the PHP output from the server
[18:31:57] <Pasq89> so, this is impossible after page is loaded?
[18:32:03] <Pasq89> hmmm...
[18:32:35] <Pasq89> so, i have to make an ajax request, build the whole new thing, and replace it there?
[18:32:47] <coldhead> something like that, yes!
[18:33:04] <coldhead> you need to have a URL on your server which returns just the stuff you need
[18:33:15] <Pasq89> hmm... i hope it works.. because what i want to load, is an jqrid table..
[18:33:31] <coldhead> that sounds tricky!
[18:33:32] <coldhead> good luck!
[18:33:52] <Pasq89> basically was a URL that returned whatever needed to appear a jqgrid.. thank you coldhead ! :)
[18:34:05] <Pasq89> you saved me time, and a question on stackoverflow .com !
[18:34:27] <coldhead> Pasq89: give it a try and ask here if you get stuck
[18:36:36] <Dr4g> hi coldhead o/
[18:36:40] <Dr4g> $('.docs-header ul.nav li:not(".docs-dropdown") a').click(function() {
[18:36:47] <coldhead> hallo dr4gsy
[18:36:59] <Dr4g> this still binds to elements that are inside li.docs-dropdown
[18:37:12] <Dr4g> whereas it should bind to 'a' tags that are NOT inside li.docs-dropdown
[18:37:40] <coldhead> lose the "quotes" inside the :not()
[18:37:51] <Dr4g> fucking stack overflow told me to do that
[18:38:03] <coldhead> stack overflow might be right
[18:38:08] <coldhead> i'm just saying what i'd try
[18:38:48] <TaylorBaby1985> www.quickcollegehookups.com is accepting 45 more free accounts!
[18:38:49] <Pasq89> thank you! i ll cross my fingers..
[18:39:17] <coldhead> goddamn it freenode, i was interested!
[18:39:29] <Pasq89> hmm .. okay... launching firebug! :P
[18:40:32] <Dr4g> coldhead: no change
[18:40:39] <Dr4g> it still triggers on 'a' tags inside .docs-dropdown
[18:41:49] <coldhead> then i would try $('.docs-header ul.nav li').filter(':not(.docs-dropdown)').find('a').click(function() {
[18:43:11] <Dr4g> ok
[18:45:12] <Dr4g> coldhead: this works
[18:45:13] <Dr4g> $('.docs-header ul.nav li a').not($('.docs-header .docs-dropdown a')).click(function() {
[18:45:16] <patrick99e99> is there a way to get all form fields that begin with a certain name?  like if I had inputs with names like: name="foo[bar][baz]", name="foo[bar][borf]" ..  Is there a selector that can get all the elements that are part of foo[bar] ?
[18:45:37] <Pasq89> ajax it says 404 not found.. but path is correct! :/
[18:46:00] <mordof> patrick99e99: yeah, one sec
[18:46:59] <Pasq89> okay.. path was wrong! :)
[18:47:40] <mordof> patrick99e99: two things.  [name^=""] is for starts with,  [name*=""] straight up string contains
[18:47:49] <mordof> patrick99e99: use them both, foo for start, bar for contains
[18:47:50] <patrick99e99> groovy
[18:48:21] <coldhead> gross, dr4g but working solutions++
[18:48:55] <mordof> coldhead: wait, what are you trying to do??
[18:49:26] <Dr4g> coldhead: hey it's not a contest :)
[18:49:34] <tw2113> coldhead is trying to figure out why $ is not defined
[18:49:48] <tw2113> this money thing is confusing him
[18:49:58] <mordof> o.O
[18:51:03] <mordof> Dr4g: wait  - was it you with the initial problem?
[18:51:20] <Dr4g> mordof: with?
[18:51:32] <mordof> that double selector event bind thing you've got goin there
[18:51:46] <patrick99e99> mordof: why would I use both? wouldn't I just want to do name^="foo[bar]" ?
[18:52:04] <Dr4g> mordof: uhh yes? :-)
[18:52:09] <Dr4g> the above trigger worked.
[18:52:11] <mordof> patrick99e99: because then foo[baz][bar] wouldn't work
[18:52:16] <Dr4g> $('.docs-header ul.nav li a').not($('.docs-header .docs-dropdown a')).click(function() {
[18:52:26] <mordof> Dr4g: was asking exactly what the scenario was, so as to try and refine that to something a bit better :P
[18:52:26] <coldhead> mordof: he's trying to make this work $('.docs-header ul.nav li:not(.docs-dropdown) a').click(function() {
[18:52:48] <mordof> i would first try to put a > in between the li and a
[18:52:54] <mordof> to force it to be a descendant of the li
[18:52:59] <Dr4g> okay
[18:53:15] <patrick99e99> mordof: I see.. but my form field will never have baz own bar.. only the other way around..  but---  How do you use both anyway?  you can't do name^*=
[18:53:15] <mordof> that might be why it initially didn't work, as ul.nav a can still trigger that descendant jump
[18:53:33] <mordof> patrick99e99: [name^=""][name*=""]
[18:53:41] <patrick99e99> I see
[18:54:41] <mordof> patrick99e99: either way - if you're using an array style naming scheme, there will be times when you can't just use "starts with". If you CAN use starts with, then you shouldn't be using an array type naming scheme
[18:55:29] <mordof> well, i suppose you still might be able to - but under diferent circumstances as to what the selector is for
[18:56:01] <jackp10> hi to everyone
[18:56:06] <Pasq89> coldhead, remember my problem? i made the AJAX, get the result from php (is html and javascript),  save it to a variable, and $('#id').replaceWith(varString) ..
[18:56:11] <Pasq89> and i get a NaN !
[18:56:35] <mordof> jackp10: hi
[18:56:37] <jackp10> I am trying to do something that I am not sure it can be done‚Ä¶ (it doesn't work so far)
[18:56:57] <mordof> jackp10: that's almost always not going to be the case, heh
[18:56:58] <coldhead> can you show us the html + js your PHP is returning, Pasq89 ?
[18:57:09] <mordof> jackp10: unless you're trying to make the client computer morph into a spaceship and carry the user to mars
[18:57:33] <jackp10> i have a button that, when clicked, fire a $.ajax to a php file that loop through  200 items, which takes sometime
[18:57:52] <jackp10> i do store an incremental value into the session via php
[18:57:53] <jackp10> now
[18:58:37] <jackp10> i am trying to fire another $.ajax call to a different php file who just return the value of that session parameter and update a div
[18:59:04] <jackp10> at the moment, the second ajax call does get called only when the first one is finished
[18:59:13] <mordof> jackp10: why would you use 2 for that?
[18:59:21] <mordof> jackp10: why can't you return that session data in the first one?
[18:59:43] <Pasq89> coldhead, i dont mind, but i think i m missing somethin in javascript.. i return the result as a string from the JS Ajax function.. and it is NaN
[18:59:52] <jackp10> because the first one take a while to process, and the result get back only after php has finished
[19:00:18] <mordof> Pasq89: that could be due to how you're trying to work with the data in PHP also, if PHP is directly returning NaN
[19:00:40] <mordof> jackp10: you just said your second ajax call gets called only when the first one is finished, so that shouldn't matter
[19:00:42] <Pasq89> directly?
[19:00:48] <jackp10> so i thought that if i call another one and only get the session value (on which change throughout the loop on the first call), i could possibly make it work
[19:01:03] <mordof> Pasq89: ignore that word - PHP may be outputting NaN itself
[19:02:14] <jackp10> mordof, i thought that since the ajax is async as default, it would have fired both calls simultaneously
[19:02:14] <Pasq89> hmm.. okay.. i m trying someething new now.. crossing again my fingers..
[19:02:36] <jackp10> even thought the second one is right after
[19:03:06] <mordof> jackp10: "jackp10 | at the moment, the second ajax call does get called only when the first one is finished "  depends on how you code it. you're the one that said it gets fired AFTER the first one is finished
[19:03:27] <mordof> jackp10: if you fire the second one right away - the first one won't have started processing anything yet, so the session variable won't even be there to return
[19:03:38] <coldhead> mordof++
[19:04:09] <mordof> coldhead:  :)
[19:04:17] <Shai_Tan> I have a ui dialog confirm box, but the script does not stop for the confirm.. it just pops up, and is gone and the form submits. How do I make my dialog box stop the submit?
[19:04:28] <jackp10> mordof, the second one is inside a setInterval that fire every second
[19:04:29] <mordof> Dr4g: did you ever try using the descendant selector?
[19:04:38] <mordof> jackp10: yuck >.< heh
[19:04:59] <Dr4g> mordof: yea, and probably could have gotten it working but was happy with the .not() function call
[19:05:09] <Dr4g> more concerned about getting the app refactored
[19:05:35] <mordof> hmm
[19:07:04] <jackp10> mordof, here is the code: http://pastebin.com/GSAJ5J1t
[19:07:27] <Dr4g> mordof: new appraoch
[19:07:29] <Dr4g> 	iframe.find('.docs-header ul.nav li a:not(.dropdown-toggle)').click(function() {
[19:07:29] <Dr4g> 		window.location.href = $(this).attr('href');
[19:07:30] <Dr4g> 	});
[19:07:36] <mordof> Dr4g: http://jsfiddle.net/kw795/  it works just fine for me
[19:07:47] <Dr4g> mordof: it's 3am, i've been refactoring all night
[19:07:48] <mordof> Dr4g: it's not a problem with jquery
[19:07:56] <jackp10> now, the "var a" and "var b" is something i tried to test
[19:08:16] <Pasq89> so, the idea was: run the ajax, and when result is ready, do $('myid').replaceWith(RESULT_GOT); ..
[19:08:48] <mordof> Pasq89: did you confirm with the console that the PHP returned the expected results?
[19:08:51] <Pasq89> but it doesnt replace anything.. even with hardcoded .replacewith('test'); .. is this forbiden in onreadystatechange ?
[19:09:00] <mordof> Pasq89: (not the ajax console output, but the actual network tab response)
[19:09:08] <mordof> hmm
[19:09:17] <Pasq89> yes, the php returned code.. i checked with firebug
[19:09:48] <mordof> Pasq89: what EXACTLY are you running .replaceWith on?
[19:10:46] <Pasq89> hmmm some pastebin! http://pastebin.com/YM3wjKyE
[19:11:22] <mordof> Pasq89: try getting rid of the \ as your new line delimiters
[19:11:55] <mordof> hm, nevermind - i guess that works
[19:12:08] <Pasq89> and use '  ' + '  '  .. ? i had it before like this!
[19:12:37] <mordof> Pasq89: ignore that - i didn't know \ was actually a split line delimiter for js
[19:12:43] <Pasq89> mordof, is it possible to do that in onreadystatechange funcgtion?
[19:12:57] <mordof> Pasq89: if the onreadystatechange fires, it should be
[19:12:59] <mordof> yes
[19:13:01] <Pasq89> i mean change something on there..
[19:14:01] <Dr4g> mordof: wanna see my app in action?
[19:16:32] <Pasq89> hmmm...... got something else in mind.. as a solution..
[19:17:00] <tbranyen> wow 766 nicks in here! this thing is popular
[19:17:11] <Pasq89> lets say, i have all the html code i want to replace, in a file... okay? something.php (it does have nothing php... it just ends in .php )
[19:17:38] <Pasq89> can somehow call $('#id').replaceWith( something.php code ? )
[19:18:26] <mordof> Dr4g: eh, kinda busy at the moment sorry
[19:18:34] <Dr4g> mordof: yes i can see that :D
[19:18:47] <mordof> Dr4g: working on a school assignment, heh
[19:18:53] <Dr4g> have fun
[19:19:22] <mordof> Pasq89: you'd have to request the data from the server before hand somehow
[19:19:32] <mordof> Pasq89: i still don't think the .replaceWith is your problem
[19:20:46] <Pasq89> so.. to sum up.. user logins.. an ajax is running, and in that ajax, another ajax runs, to replace a div with replaceWith
[19:21:16] <Pasq89> the second ajax seems to run, (get results in firebug), but replaceWith does nothing!
[19:23:21] <mordof> Pasq89: i can't help unless you give me a proper test case
[19:23:55] <mordof> s/give/show
[19:24:41] <Pasq89> do you want code of those two functions?
[19:24:49] <delinquentme> typing $('.nav')  in the console on a webpage with jquery enabled .. should list all items with the nav class right?
[19:24:57] <danheberden> aye
[19:24:59] <mordof> delinquentme: yep
[19:25:04] <vladikoff> delinquentme, yeah it should
[19:25:10] <delinquentme> so im getting null lol

[19:26:14] <delinquentme> jQuery('.nav') does what its supposed to though
[19:26:35] <delinquentme> this is probs a conflict w prototype *LeGranFacepalm*
[19:26:46] <mordof> delinquentme: $ is just a "pointer" to the variable jQuery - when it's initialize
[19:26:47] <mordof> d
[19:27:00] <mordof> either a conflict, or intentional
[19:27:03] <delinquentme> ja! so why is it not pointering
[19:28:12] <jackp10> mordof, have you had a chance to look at the code i pasted ?
[19:28:41] <danheberden> delinquentme: does document.querySelectorAll('.nav') do anything?
[19:28:46] <mordof> jackp10: there's a lot there..
[19:28:58] <mordof> jackp10: well, not excessive amounts
[19:29:05] <jackp10> 42 lines
[19:29:09] <mordof> jackp10: but pasting the code doesn't help me when you don't have a code bug problem
[19:29:18] <danheberden> 42 lines should fix any problem all by themselves
[19:29:19] <Pasq89> mordof,  i wrote the 2 functions, and pointed in comments where to look! http://jsfiddle.net/Cqqpm/
[19:29:30] <delinquentme> danheberden, yeah! that gets me the same thing as using jQuery('.nav')
[19:29:41] <delinquentme> I'd love to be able to use $ instead of "jQuery"
[19:29:46] <danheberden> wait, wat
[19:29:49] <danheberden> lol
[19:30:07] <danheberden> delinquentme: you're either using jQuery.noConflict
[19:30:14] <danheberden> or overwriting $ with some other lib
[19:30:30] <danheberden> if you want to use $ as an alias, fix one of those two problems
[19:30:31] <jackp10> mordof: a code bug problem ? i am trying to debug it as best of my knowledge, but i don't know what else i can try to debug it
[19:30:54] <danheberden> or ( or both ), delinquentme, wrap your code in an IFFE
[19:31:00] <arielserafini> delinquentme: or pass jQuery to an IFFE
[19:31:06] <jackp10> that reason of that 2 calls is to basically create a progress bar
[19:31:08] <arielserafini> what danheberden said :)
[19:31:12] <danheberden> (function( $ ){ /* your codez here*/ }( jQuery ) );
[19:31:17] <danheberden> delinquentme: ^
[19:31:35] <delinquentme> OHHHHH yeah. what does that no conflict thing do? .. ensure that it plays well w other similar libraries?
[19:31:40] <danheberden> which is saying run this function RIGHT MEOW with jQuery - and then the function runs and it's all, like, "OH HAI $"
[19:31:46] <danheberden> delinquentme: aye
[19:31:49] <mordof> jackp10: i don't know what aspect of it isn't working o.O you said it works on intervals and checks the session data - what part of that isn't functional?
[19:31:56] <Pasq89> i think i found out...
[19:32:01] <danheberden> if $ was assigned to something else, like prototype or something, it'd get resteored to its original grandeur
[19:32:41] <Pasq89> mordof, if F***ING WORKED!!!!
[19:32:51] <mordof> Pasq89: ? what was wrong?
[19:32:55] <Matt_P> Fuck ye!
[19:33:01] <Pasq89> me, being so stupid!
[19:33:04] <mordof> lol
[19:33:09] <mordof> Pasq89: i mean what was the code problem
[19:33:09] <Pasq89> :)
[19:33:11] <Matt_P> Irc censorship !
[19:33:36] <danheberden> gross
[19:33:38] <jackp10> mordof: basically while the first ajax call run, the second one that should run simultaneously it does not
[19:33:52] <jackp10> and i dont know why
[19:33:58] <Pasq89> hehe.. emm.... i copy pasted staff for the ajax... and never called xmlhttp.responseText to get the text
[19:34:12] <danheberden> i... don't event want... ugh..
[19:34:20] <jackp10> mordof: because if i replace the secon ajax call with a simple alert, it get prompted as soon as i hit the button
[19:34:28] <Pasq89> THAT, lead the function NOT to continue executing!! so .. even replaceWith("hard coded text") didnt worked!
[19:34:38] <mordof> jackp10: did you check the network tab to make sure there wasn't an error with it?
[19:34:54] <danheberden> jackp10: where is this code?
[19:35:03] <mordof> danheberden: http://pastebin.com/GSAJ5J1t
[19:35:11] <jackp10> http://pastebin.com/GSAJ5J1t
[19:35:23] <danheberden> why is anax in a setInterval
[19:35:26] <danheberden> *ajax
[19:35:40] <danheberden> this makes me feel weird reading this
[19:35:46] <mordof> danheberden: essentially - first ajax is a long process, second is a progress update
[19:35:53] <mordof> danheberden: it's messy/hacky.. i don't like it. but..
[19:35:56] * mordof shrugs
[19:36:17] <danheberden> at least use setTimeout
[19:36:24] <danheberden> so you don't get race conditions
[19:36:41] <danheberden> make a function that does the ajax shit, on success, wait another second to call taht same function again
[19:36:52] <danheberden> each time checking for count <= 100
[19:37:02] <danheberden> if you're done, then no setTimeout
[19:38:32] <jackp10> danheberden: ok i can try that way
[19:38:58] <danheberden> jackp10: you can just imagine that if the ajax request DID take 1000ms or more
[19:39:15] <danheberden> then you'd be getting weird progress output
[19:40:19] <jackp10> the php file i call is actually returing the correct percentage of the progress
[19:40:54] <jackp10> the second ajax call, even if it takes more then 1000ms, should still get the correct result (theoretically)
[19:41:05] <danheberden> yes, but if the first one had some random latency
[19:41:14] <danheberden> and then teh second one fired and it didn't
[19:41:21] <arielserafini> jackp10: if two ajax calls overlap, the first one will return a lower percentage
[19:41:22] <danheberden> then the progress would go from, say, 50% back to 40%
[19:41:35] <arielserafini> will/can
[19:41:42] <danheberden> and people would be like "WHA?! DOTH MY EYES DECEIVE ME??"
[19:41:43] <arielserafini> could even
[19:42:04] <danheberden> plus, in general, setInterval is the devil
[19:42:11] <danheberden> so when you go to type it
[19:42:16] <danheberden> think of chuck norris crying
[19:42:22] <jackp10> :)
[19:42:24] <danheberden> you don't want to make chuck norris cry, do you?
[19:42:34] <danheberden> (like he could, lol)
[19:42:48] <jackp10> of course not
[19:43:15] <jackp10> when I read the difference between setTimeout and setInterval I thought to have chosen the right one.. perhaps not !! :(
[19:43:22] <mordof> lol, I want to make churris cry
[19:43:26] <coldhead> MINE*
[19:43:32] <imsky> my brothers
[19:43:36] <imsky> in jquery
[19:43:40] <coldhead> and sisters
[19:43:46] <imsky> and the pre-ops
[19:43:57] <coldhead> siblings!
[19:43:59] <mordof> coldhead: pssh, there are no girls here.. *giggles* lol.. i can't say that without laughing
[19:44:09] <coldhead> mordof: >>: |
[19:44:15] <imsky> what a tween
[19:44:32] <mordof> no no, i laugh because i know it's ridiculous.. i just find that stereotype to be hilarious
[19:44:35] <mordof> so i jokingly say it :)
[19:44:42] <imsky> that's exactly it
[19:45:00] <imsky> coldhead my coldhead
[19:45:16] * mordof is not a tween
[19:45:17] <jackp10> what i cannot explain is why the second ajax call (on success) does not even write anything on the firebug console, until the process of the first one is completed
[19:45:18] <mordof> btw
[19:45:28] <imsky> mordof physically no mentally yes
[19:45:33] <mordof> lol
[19:45:49] <mordof> imsky: depends on how i'm choosing to act at the time, but yeah i'll give that to you
[19:45:57] <mordof> i behave more like a teenager than i do my own age most of the time
[19:46:01] <imsky> feels so sexy to be so right
[19:46:23] <mordof> i'm entirely aware of it though :) it just makes people laugh, so i don't see a problem with it
[19:46:34] <coldhead> ?cc
[19:46:35] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[19:46:40] <mordof> o.o
[19:46:48] <imsky> the bot has spoaken
[19:46:57] <mordof> which case?
[19:47:11] * mordof was talking about himself acting like a moron
[19:47:21] <imsky> i love this chan
[19:47:28] <mordof> lol
[19:47:28] <coldhead> the sexism and immaturity cases, all closed
[19:47:42] <coldhead> good hussle team, let's take 5
[19:47:48] <mordof> o.o how was that sexism?
[19:48:35] <coldhead> not accusing you of anything, mordof!
[19:48:38] * imsky slaps coldhead on the ass
[19:48:40] * imsky hard
[19:48:41] <coldhead> we're all good in this hood
[19:48:52] <mordof> i.. am so confused..
[19:49:16] * imsky claps them cheeks
[19:49:22] <arielserafini> is this #jqueery?
[19:49:30] <mordof> arielserafini: minus the one e, yes
[19:49:32] <imsky> no, you want another chan for your degeneracy
[19:49:36] <mordof> lol
[19:49:47] <arielserafini> mordof: you ruined it :/
[19:50:03] <coldhead> I THOUGHT WE WERE ALl going to tAKE 5
[19:50:14] <mordof> coldhead: i don't think that'll ever work, sorry
[19:50:23] <imsky> I AM TAKING FIVE
[19:50:25] * imsky TAKES SIX
[19:50:34] <coldhead> then all is lost, and i have lived in vain
[19:50:41] <coldhead> my life's work is but straw
[19:50:41] <imsky> you already have
[19:50:43] <imsky> yes
[19:51:01] * mordof starts planning coldhead's funeral
[19:51:12] <imsky> he's only spiritually dead
[19:51:14] <imsky> not physically
[19:51:25] <coldhead> mordof: i would like my mother to carry my coffin please
[19:51:27] <coldhead> unassisted
[19:51:33] <coldhead> and i would like the coffin to be filled with bricks
[19:51:41] <mordof> bahahaha
[19:51:49] <mordof> coldhead: got something against your mother do you? lol
[19:52:01] <coldhead> i just think it would be an amusing spectacle
[19:52:04] <coldhead> she'd be up for it
[19:52:07] <imsky> it would be
[19:52:11] <imsky> write me into your will
[19:52:12] <mordof> lol
[19:52:37] <coldhead> as to music, i'd like The Loneliest Enuretic by A Minor Forest. the original and maybe some tasteful choral arrangmenets
[19:52:57] <imsky> i hate coldhead when the mask slips
[19:53:17] <imsky> and he's revealed to be a scruffy gen-y bro who listens to hip shit
[19:53:18] <arielserafini> jBuried or cremated?
[19:53:18] <coldhead> it's masks all the way down
[19:53:25] <mordof> coldhead: pssh, i didn't say i was taking requests as to what was going to be at your funeral. it's going to be very boring and dull.. i don't put much effort into planning
[19:53:44] <coldhead> if you fail to plan, you plan to fail, mordof
[19:54:01] <mordof> oh i have plans for stuff that MATTERS..
[19:54:03] <mordof> lol
[19:54:05] <imsky> but you can plan to plan
[19:54:08] <imsky> and fail to fail
[19:54:15] <coldhead> but you make a good point, i can't trust anyone to handle my arrangments properly
[19:54:22] <coldhead> death simply isn't an option at this juncture
[19:54:29] <mordof> coldhead: you should plan your own funeral
[19:54:43] <coldhead> i have a few hundred pages of notes already
[19:54:51] <coldhead> mostly about my mother carrying the brick coffin
[19:55:02] <imsky> we will be brothers
[19:55:13] <coldhead> a few good weekend at bernie's bits at the end
[19:55:14] <coldhead> for the kids
[19:55:19] <coldhead> sunglasses and pretend waving
[19:55:28] <imsky> john cena waving?
[19:55:32] <imsky> CANT SEE ME
[19:55:52] <imsky> http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2427/3888750120_5b84ab4124.jpg
[19:57:31] <coldhead> this comet was the only man i loved
[19:57:51] <imsky> computer people should not be into humanities
[19:58:02] <imsky> they obsess over brick coffins otherwise
[19:58:18] <coldhead> i AM into the humanities but i know it makes me shit at computing
[19:58:20] <coldhead> so it's okay
[19:58:29] <imsky> u and steve jobs bro
[19:58:44] <coldhead> i wish i had died instead of him
[19:58:46] <coldhead> there, i said it
[19:58:47] <imsky> me 2
[19:59:01] <coldhead> it's safe to assume everyone wishes i were dead
[19:59:03] <coldhead> except my mother
[19:59:17] <imsky> once you realize it tho, it doesnt change anything
[20:00:21] <coldhead> but then the humanities give me comfort
[20:00:33] <jackp10> no luck with setTimeout
[20:00:33] <coldhead> "oh this is just like that bit in jude the obscure where the children hang themselves"
[20:00:37] <jackp10> here is an example: http://pastebin.com/ge13U4Li
[20:00:52] <imsky> coldhead false comfort, youre missing out on important literature
[20:01:20] <jackp10> the php file get called, but it hangs there until the first ajax call is terminated
[20:01:31] <imsky> bro
[20:01:33] <imsky> wrong chan
[20:03:12] <jackp10> is it possible that the success get mixed up between the 2 calls ? it might be a silly question, i am not sure
[20:03:16] <mordof> imsky: it's not the wrong channel, but..
[20:03:26] <mordof> jackp10: there is a limit to how many connections can be made too
[20:03:42] <mordof> jackp10: which is one of the problems with the method you're trying to use
[20:03:52] <jackp10> oh
[20:05:15] <jackp10> i was not aware about the limit of the connections.. that changes things !! i will have to find a different approach then
[20:05:30] <jackp10> i thought I could make as may ajax calls as required
[20:05:39] <jackp10> until it got to 100%
[20:05:54] <mordof> different browsers, on different operating systems, all have limits as to how many concurrent connections can be made
[20:06:43] <jackp10> ok
[20:07:33] <jackp10> i am not sure that this is causing the problem I have, but it is definitely something that i will have to change
[20:08:04] <jackp10> well, i will try to think a different solution to achieve the same result.
[20:08:23] <jackp10> for now thanks for your patience mordof and your help
[20:09:20] <mordof> jackp10: there are other ways, like processing it in chunks, etc.. or using an octet/strem and parsing the data chunks, etc
[20:10:13] <jackp10> ok.. will research more in that way
[20:10:20] <jackp10> thanks
[20:46:21] <digs> I am having trouble with these 2 lines: var billingAddress = $('div.billingAddress'); var inputsToCheck = billingAddress.find('input:not(#edit-billingaddress2)');
[20:46:54] <digs> I do not want to check the optional part of the billing address. But I do want to check all of the other inputs in the billing address div.
[20:47:05] <digs> How can I do that?
[20:57:39] <danheberden> digs, add, like, data-optional="true" to the optional ones?
[20:58:18] <danheberden> then billingAddress.find('input:not([data-optional])') or whatever
[20:58:21] <danheberden> or use a class
[20:58:56] <danheberden> or use data-required and get billingAddress.find('input[billing-required]')
[21:02:16] <imsky> validation probably should not be tied to dom
[21:02:19] <imsky> JUST MY OPINIONS
[21:04:47] <danheberden> all the things to the dom
[21:04:50] <danheberden> ALL THE THINGS
[21:05:08] <imsky> NO
[21:05:20] <danheberden> we need some kind of sql abstraction that uses jsdom
[21:05:24] <danheberden> to store the content
[21:05:39] <imsky> a good idea brother my brother
[21:16:20] <heshanh> hey guys, how do i target a <a> tag that has the name="book" <a href="#" name="book">xx</a>
[21:16:56] <danheberden> just like you would in css, heshanh
[21:17:05] <danheberden> a[name="book"]
[21:17:32] <heshanh> oh! i didnt kniow u could do that. thank you :)
[21:17:52] <danheberden> ?selectors @ heshanh
[21:17:53] <bot-t> heshanh, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1ñ3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[21:18:16] <heshanh> thank you
[21:21:21] <Cork> heshanh: though name on a tag are depricated now days
[21:21:28] <Cork> heshanh: you should just use id instead
[21:22:20] <coldhead> deprecated*
[21:23:07] <danheberden> depreciated
[21:23:29] <coldhead> tax-deductible
[21:25:41] <coldhead> YES WE CAN BOLSTER UP AN ARMY TO BE THE FACE OF ALL THE PARTY FOR ALL TIMES
[21:25:42] <heshanh> yeah i think ill replace it with ID
[21:25:50] <coldhead> good call, heshanh
[21:25:53] <imsky> coldhead i bet youre employed
[21:25:59] <imsky> and just staving off your job hours
[21:26:02] <imsky> on irc
[21:26:26] <coldhead> it's true, trying to get fired
[21:26:39] <heshanh> lol
[21:27:21] <imsky> called it
[21:34:13] <tw2113> coldhead, you're fired
[21:38:40] <coldhead> see i'd love to be asked to clear out my desk BUT I DON'T EVEN HAVE A DESK
[21:38:43] <coldhead> WE'RE HOT DESKING
[21:45:19] <tw2113> you weren't important enough for one
[21:45:21] <tw2113> it was your first day
[21:54:55] <optraz> in firebug, how do i include a script ?
[21:55:14] <Eviltwin> Create a script tag, set the src, add it to the <head> or <body>
[21:56:03] <optraz> no, i dont want to do that..
[21:59:14] <microcode> how do I get jQuery's attr function to recognize the 'placeholder' attribute?
[21:59:49] <microcode> oh wow
[21:59:54] <microcode> it only accepts single quotes :(
[22:08:51] <Cork> optraz: simplest solution is to just copy and run the content of the script file
[22:09:06] <rodyhaddad> Hey guys, if I have 2 jQuery object containing 1 DOM element each, how can I create a new jQuery object that contain both DOM elements?
[22:09:18] <Cork> optraz: if you really want to load the file from its location, you really have to create a script tag and attach it to the page
[22:09:40] <Cork> ?.add @ rodyhaddad
[22:09:41] <bot-t> rodyhaddad, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[22:10:03] <Cork> rodyhaddad: remember though, it returns the new object, it doesn't modify the original one
[22:12:12] <epitron> is there a way to set the order of the things that are executed on document ready?
[22:12:42] <epitron> (i'm using the rails asset pipeline, which smashes all your scripts into one big file... in whatever order it finds them)
[22:12:47] <rodyhaddad> Oh! :O it returns a new object, thanks! :D idk why I thought it mutates the object :p
[22:13:27] <epitron> i guess i could make a method called "prioritized_ready(priority, callback)"
[22:13:35] <epitron> and then maintain some sorted list
[22:23:39] <miCSu> is there a selector for mouseover?
[22:24:13] <miCSu> I'm trying to stop processing a script if specific element is hovered
[22:29:32] <danheberden> a.. selector?
[22:29:39] <danheberden> i mean, you can :hover in css
[22:29:55] <danheberden> but i don't think that's what you are talking about
[23:12:02] <NoOova> hello all! how i could handle event from jqueryui widget factory?
[23:12:20] <NoOova> i want to set event handler in _create method
[23:13:01] <devnill> I'm using .on("click",...) to append a row to a table but I'm unable to detect when people click on the content like I normally can with .live()
[23:13:24] <devnill> is there another argument that i need to feed .on() so it can track events?
[23:13:27] <NoOova> this.element.on(this.widgetEventPrefix + 'EventName', callback); but it doesnt work
[23:14:31] <NoOova> devnill: maybe in tables event handlers exists handler with stopPropaganation() ?
[23:14:57] <NoOova> and click event doesnt bubbles to table?
[23:15:29] <devnill> well the other table rows work and they have the exact same structure
[23:17:21] <bubu1> speaking of on(), is there an eventType for "created" or something along those lines
[23:18:39] <r500> I had small prblem here... if i kept this script runnig for more than 5 mins or so.. the slideshow speed increases. can acny one help me on this? http://jsfiddle.net/bHFdB/1/
[23:18:47] <bubu1> i want to bind something to an element when it (dynamically) gets added to the DOM
[23:19:21] <arielserafini> bubu1: it's still .on() that you want
[23:20:02] <bubu1> so do i have to undbind/rebind something on every "click" event
[23:20:37] <devnill> according to http://api.jquery.com/on/ it should bind?
[23:21:04] <arielserafini> bubu1: $("body").on("click", "div", function(){ })
[23:21:24] <arielserafini> you can pass a selector as the second param
[23:21:30] <bubu1> right i understand
[23:21:44] <bubu1> but im trying to initialize a context menu
[23:21:48] <r500> arielserafini:
[23:21:50] <AdamPDotty> maybe you mean .on('ready')
[23:22:17] <bubu1> and i dont want to initialize the context menu everytime it gets clicked
[23:22:24] <arielserafini> r500: ?
[23:22:40] <AdamPDotty> or .ready()
[23:22:48] <noregret> can someone tell me why this functino is returning undefined ? https://pastee.org/3p6s6
[23:22:52] <arielserafini> r500: oh, i'll have a look at your fiddle
[23:22:58] <bigLanky> anyone interested in helping me create a custom slider?
[23:23:07] <bigLanky> its for my work and we can pay
[23:23:15] <arielserafini> bigLanky: I can help you later
[23:23:17] <arielserafini> for free
[23:23:17] <r500> I had small prblem here... if i kept this script runnig for more than 5 mins or so.. the slideshow speed increases.  can u help me on this? http://jsfiddle.net/bHFdB/1/
[23:23:24] <arielserafini> but not right now :/
[23:23:26] <bigLanky> ok
[23:23:29] <bigLanky> when is later
[23:23:35] <bubu1> AdamPDotty: i think ready is on called one time, when the DOM is ready
[23:23:43] <bubu1> *only called
[23:23:48] <arielserafini> bigLanky: tomorrow?
[23:23:56] <bigLanky> sure
[23:23:59] <bigLanky> what time zone are you in
[23:24:01] <arielserafini> r500: you should't use setInterval
[23:24:01] <AdamPDotty> or, when an element is ready, and that, what you want
[23:24:07] <arielserafini> bigLanky: GMT-3
[23:24:13] <arielserafini> or UTC-3
[23:24:17] <arielserafini> whatever it's called now
[23:24:21] <bigLanky> ok
[23:24:36] <arielserafini> you?
[23:24:39] <bigLanky> PST
[23:24:43] <bigLanky> its 1130pm here
[23:24:45] <r500> arielserafini:  huh ..??  then what can i use there?!!
[23:24:58] <arielserafini> r500: use setTimeout instead
[23:25:00] <bigLanky> let me show you what i need and then you tell me if its doable
[23:25:15] <arielserafini> bigLanky: I remember it from earlier
[23:25:27] <arielserafini> but I was leaving the office
[23:25:33] <bigLanky> you think you can figure out a solution
[23:25:42] <arielserafini> yeah, I've done that before
[23:25:44] <bigLanky> oh were you the one who messaged me?
[23:26:00] <arielserafini> bigLanky: I asked you something on the channel, that's all
[23:26:06] <bigLanky> ah
[23:26:11] <BinaryKitten> arielserafini what's wrong with setInterval?
[23:26:19] <Eviltwin> Everything
[23:26:26] <bigLanky> what time should i make sure to check irc for your availability?
[23:26:30] <r500> arielserafini:  ok giving it a try...
[23:26:46] <BinaryKitten> Eviltwin shh you.. you think everything is wrong with everything
[23:26:51] <arielserafini> bigLanky: in about 10 hours from now
[23:26:57] <bigLanky> ok perfect
[23:27:00] <bigLanky> i will be on then
[23:27:01] <arielserafini> I should be on all day after that
[23:27:07] <bigLanky> sounds good
[23:27:13] <bubu1> AdamPDotty: i don't know if "ready" works in my case
[23:27:14] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[23:27:31] <bigLanky> ive put countless hours into trying to rework this and get it to work. if we can come up with a solution i would be very greatful
[23:27:40] <BinaryKitten> arielserafini what's wrong with setInterval?
[23:28:13] <AdamPDotty> noregret: content does not get set anywhere in that function
[23:28:31] <arielserafini> BinaryKitten: the problem with setInterval is that you set an interval to call a function, and the counter restarts right after the function is CALLED, not after it has finished
[23:28:38] * AdamPDotty seconds the Kitten
[23:28:53] <r500> arielserafini: http://jsfiddle.net/bHFdB/2/ it loads only 2nd image and slideshow stops working
[23:29:12] <noregret> AdamPDotty: what ? it is set in the ajax response..
[23:29:27] <arielserafini> r500: sorry, I wasn't clear :/ you need to then call setTimeout again after you've ran your code
[23:29:28] <AdamPDotty> but thats a different scope
[23:29:49] <BinaryKitten> ah arielserafini  so nothing wrong with setInterval, just not appropriate for this usage
[23:30:11] <AdamPDotty> if you put var content; in global scope, its not nice but would work
[23:30:18] <arielserafini> BinaryKitten: well, it's really not appropriate for any usage IMO
[23:30:30] <arielserafini> it's not reliable at all
[23:30:39] <AdamPDotty> better even, put it in a namespace and call it with namespace
[23:31:06] <AdamPDotty> ariel: its called reliable after CALL of function
[23:31:20] <noregret> AdamPDotty: didn't know namespaces can be used in js, how can I do that?
[23:31:26] <BinaryKitten> AdamPDotty what's the difference between 1 variable on it's own compared to one in a "namespace"
[23:31:38] <BinaryKitten> since the "namespace" is a variable in global scope
[23:31:52] <noregret> AdamPDotty: wait, can i return in the if/else clause ?
[23:31:53] <AdamPDotty> its safer, will elss likely get overwritten by other code
[23:32:13] <BinaryKitten> AdamPDotty not really less likely
[23:32:19] <BinaryKitten> depending on the "namespace"
[23:32:19] <AdamPDotty> return might work, I am not sure there
[23:32:35] <AdamPDotty> thats "less"
[23:32:55] <r500> arielserafini:  do  you mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/bHFdB/3/
[23:32:56] <AdamPDotty> so "less" is depending on namespace
[23:33:11] <BinaryKitten> AdamPDotty i mean that a namespace var is just as likely to be overwritten as any other var
[23:33:18] <noregret> AdamPDotty: also returned undefined, wonder why
[23:33:28] <AdamPDotty> hmm no
[23:33:49] <BinaryKitten> AdamPDotty: why no?
[23:33:56] <AdamPDotty> the chance that somone else uses exactly your namespace is lower than that he uses global
[23:34:04] * AdamPDotty misses some letters today
[23:34:13] <noregret> it's like that now, https://pastee.org/9x9zc
[23:34:33] <BinaryKitten> AdamPDotty never underestimate the power of misunderstanding
[23:34:54] <AdamPDotty> I dont say the chance is much lower, but lower anyway
[23:35:30] <AdamPDotty> umm, noregret: you dont need to return twice
[23:35:30] <noregret> I don't really care about namespaces and stuff.. i just want my function to return that content :)
[23:35:45] <AdamPDotty> and you dont assign it to anything
[23:35:51] <BinaryKitten> so var dialog = { options: { blah:1 } };   is safer than var dialog_options = {blah:1};  // crude example
[23:36:16] <AdamPDotty> a bit yes, I would say
[23:36:27] <noregret> AdamPDotty: show me a valid solutoin then
[23:36:28] <AdamPDotty> not much anyway
[23:37:01] <AdamPDotty> norregret: as I wrote first try is to have var conten; in global scope
[23:37:03] <AdamPDotty> t
[23:37:10] <BinaryKitten> AdamPDotty: i'm a big fan of IIFE
[23:37:11] <AdamPDotty> just move it there
[23:37:41] <AdamPDotty> International Institute for Family Enterprises *fg*
[23:38:07] <BinaryKitten> Imediately Instantiated Function Executable i think
[23:38:13] <badbandit> hello, I have a bunch of divs with a shared class and I want to iterate through them all, calculate the height of an inner element, and then add all those values into an array
[23:38:19] <badbandit> what would be the most efficient way to do that?
[23:38:27] <arielserafini> r500: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/bHFdB/4/
[23:38:34] <BinaryKitten> but anyhow in all seriousness noregret that's not going to work
[23:39:00] <badbandit> $('.item').each().outerHeight().push(arrayName);?
[23:39:10] <BinaryKitten> the SpamBlock is going to end/exit before the $.getJson is completed
[23:39:21] <BinaryKitten> so no amount of returning content will work
[23:40:03] <AdamPDotty> well right, but setting it might help
[23:40:21] <noregret> shit, also return undefined
[23:40:23] <BinaryKitten> it was set. content var inherited from line 4
[23:40:27] <noregret> even though it's global
[23:40:38] <EasyCo> Has anybody experience a problem when using $(window).height() having it return the whole body dimension instead of the viewport dimension? I'm editing an old site with long tables and when the table is longer then the view port it seem to be making .height() behave oddly.
[23:40:41] <noregret> so what is my solution in this case
[23:41:02] <AdamPDotty> still different scope
[23:41:13] <BinaryKitten> noregret what is your target for content..
[23:41:17] <BinaryKitten> where does it go?
[23:41:30] <noregret> https://pastee.org/8c9zy
[23:41:41] <BinaryKitten> ?
[23:41:53] <BinaryKitten> that's not going to work well
[23:42:05] <BinaryKitten> ok where is the content meant to end up
[23:43:20] <arielserafini> badbandit: http://jsfiddle.net/VUSAj/
[23:43:24] <r500> arielserafini:  ok will give it a try..
[23:43:36] <noregret> BinaryKitten: https://pastee.org/4c7ks
[23:43:47] <arielserafini> r500: did you get the general idea?
[23:44:07] <BinaryKitten> ah i see noregret
[23:44:15] <BinaryKitten> ok give me about 5 minutes?
[23:44:20] <AdamPDotty> 4
[23:44:29] <BinaryKitten> ?
[23:44:39] <noregret> take your time
[23:44:42] <AdamPDotty> just kitting
[23:44:51] <noregret> stop kitting around
[23:44:56] <BinaryKitten> you started counting seconds ... lol
[23:45:15] <AdamPDotty> and I use setInterval for it
[23:45:39] <noregret> BinaryKitten: now, i can do that without the need for that function, but i need tehat same content in other places, that's why i created the func
[23:46:00] <r500> arielserafini:  kind of..!!
[23:46:25] <r500> through settimeout Myfunc is being called recuringly
[23:47:35] <BinaryKitten> noregret the easiest way is to pass SpamBlock a call back function
[23:47:46] <BinaryKitten> i'll make that into a fiddle so you can see
[23:47:58] <noregret> alrighty
[23:48:25] <AdamPDotty> hmm, do you know what the use for those fiddle strings?
[23:48:50] <BinaryKitten> AdamPDotty: yes, do you?
[23:49:58] <NoOova> how i can handle all events on element?
[23:59:13] <arielserafini> NoOova: you can call .on() with as many events as you like
[23:59:21] <arielserafini> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:59:46] <arielserafini> I don't think there's an easy way to bind to all events, though
[23:59:52] <arielserafini> (why would you need that?)
