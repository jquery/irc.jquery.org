[00:02:51] <LukeNukem> defendguin, if the record is deleted i should do <deleted>true</deleted> right
[00:03:35] <cpaq> hi, you know .append(), anyone use it, I tried it, and it works good but not great.  See, if you append some stuff, and you include element id's and class's in hopes of styling the new elements too, well they don't work, the styles don't apply and not only that, if you append a form element, it doesn't register/or-something either, cause I am usinng jcart and appended <form>'s aren't working with ajax
[00:04:13] <LukeNukem> cpaq, if you want styles to work, first you create an empty div and apply inline css or external css however you want
[00:04:16] <LukeNukem> and then use .append
[00:04:43] <defendguin> LukeNukem: that's how i would do it
[00:04:51] <defendguin> 1 or 0 works too
[00:05:16] <cpaq> LukeNukem, hmm, so you have to style it separately?  There is no way to you existing styles in a separted styesheet that syles everything else on the page
[00:07:02] <LukeNukem> cpaq, i dont understand your question
[00:10:09] <cpaq> LukeNukem, what do you mean inline css or external css.  If I have <div id="appendHere">Appended stuff:</div>, and then in a separate style sheet I put, #blackbg {background: black;}, and then in javascript I put $("#appendHere").append("<div id='blackbg'>SOmething</div>");, can I expect a black background for my appended element, cause as far as I can tell, the black background style doesn't get applied
[00:12:02] <LukeNukem> cpaq, fiddle please
[00:12:10] <LukeNukem> it should work, logic seems correct
[00:12:23] <LukeNukem> cpaq, try it with .html instead of .append
[00:13:10] <defendguin> i use append all the time works great
[00:13:37] <LukeNukem> defendguin, append is for appending new stuff onto an existing div with html content
[00:13:44] <LukeNukem> html is for replacing whatever content is in the div
[00:13:48] <LukeNukem> i think he is look for the latter
[00:13:56] <defendguin> the div can be empty you you add to it
[00:14:35] <defendguin> possibly
[00:14:44] <cpaq> LukeNukem, ok, i am gonna try that, give me a few mins
[00:14:46] <LukeNukem> ok
[00:15:51] <defendguin> you should have double quotes around your id
[00:17:08] <defendguin> $("#appendHere").append('<div id="blackbg">SOmething</div>')
[00:19:31] <LukeNukem> defendguin, dude if sql record is deleted, and php outputs true but jquery does not evaluate to true o.o
[00:20:15] <cpaq> Actually, I was mistaken, it works fine
[00:20:23] <cpaq> defendguin, no, single quotes work just fine
[00:21:04] <cpaq> thanks guys
[00:21:52] <defendguin> hmmm  i thought it was against html spec to use single quotes for attributes
[00:22:22] <cpaq> defendguin, dunno, maybe, but it works just fine
[00:51:46] <skyl> hello, anyone know how I can add a dialog page to my history in jquery mobile?
[00:53:08] <skyl> open dialog, go to new page, go back to dialog ...
[00:55:31] <robbington> I have a simple jquery statment, but it seems to be failing, I have one div with an id '#testDiv', in my code var testDiv = jQuery('#testDiv'); alert(jQuery(testDiv)); result is undefined.
[00:56:29] <AnthonyCat> the id shouldn't include the # in html, but instead <div id="testDiv"></div>. Is that your problem?
[00:57:06] <nights> hmm
[00:57:09] <nights> i have a problem
[00:57:17] <robbington> no, I was just showing that I have a div with that Id
[00:57:30] <robbington> console.log returns nothing at all
[00:57:43] <nights> when i  use filter().html on a div that strips away the script tags included
[00:57:43] <robbington> even if I console.log('test'); which is worrying
[00:57:46] <nights> what can i do about it?
[00:57:55] <AnthonyCat> yeah, console.log(undefined) does nothing
[00:58:14] <robbington> but console.log(string) should
[00:58:19] <AnthonyCat> yes.
[00:58:29] <jita> can i do something like $('#filter-results').on("whilePlaying", "lastSound", function(event) {} ?
[00:58:42] <jita> lastSound is the object instance of Soundmanager2 plugin
[00:58:44] <robbington> but it dont, no errors being reported in firebug, bu of a head scratcher
[00:58:51] <AnthonyCat> what about document.getElementById("testDiv"); does that equal null?
[00:58:52] <jita> and it regularly fires whilePlaying event on its objects
[00:58:58] <jita> can i cath those events ?
[00:59:04] <jita> catch*
[01:01:25] <AnthonyCat> javascript doesn't have a system to fire events on objects (only the dom elements) to my knowledge. It would depend on the API of soundmanager2
[01:01:25] <robbington> strange, alert returns (Object object), console.log returns nothing and alert(jquery('#testDiv').attr('id')) returns undefined
[01:02:37] <nights> can anyone help?
[01:02:38] <nights> 				var responsehtml = $response.filter('#responsehtml').html();
[01:02:38] <nights> 				jQuery('#nextinfo').html(responsehtml);
[01:02:41] <nights> this filters out script tag
[01:02:43] <nights> :(
[01:02:51] <nights> and if i use text nothing is dispalyed
[01:03:53] <robbington> ok, now that is odd, if you type console.log('test'); into firebug console it returns 'undefined' is this a bug anyne is aware of?
[01:07:29] <gyaresu> Re-posting from JQM channel: Has anyone seen Google Maps not play nicely with JQM? The map controls & InfoWindow's are slightly skewed. If one of the map divs changes from z-index:1 to :0 then it's fine. I have no extra styling applied. My dev site with the example is here: http://oslogigs-dev.appspot.com/mobile
[01:08:02] <jita> I want to hook into this event lastSound.onPosition(5000, function(eventPosition) {}, but i cannot do that on document load because the lastSound is not defined at load. How can i attach a handler to that ?
[01:10:14] <AnthonyCat> robbington: console.log returns undefined
[01:10:26] <AnthonyCat> always
[01:13:59] <robbington> AnthonyCat, it seems to be a problem with my site, as I can run console.log('test') and get the expected result on any other web page
[01:14:06] <robbington> not sure what would be causing this
[01:15:56] <AnthonyCat> very odd. It is probably a bug, unless you have written over the top of the window.console object. You could try disabling javascript, then enabling it, then trying to console.log
[01:16:13] <mikkelb> At https://gist.github.com/1992835 - I have some JS that knows whether a user has selected the radio "Yes I have a password, continue to regular checkout", or the "No, I don't, continue to guest checkout". Like this: http://i.imgur.com/aXE4V.png
[01:16:14] <AnthonyCat> (disabling the javascript at the start to ensure your script doesn't run)
[01:16:17] <mikkelb> I get the feeling though that the JS is way more complicated than it has to be - can anybody think of ways to maybe simplify it?
[01:16:22] <Krinkle> robbington: No
[01:16:27] <Krinkle> robbington: console.log() is a function
[01:16:39] <Krinkle> robbington: The return value of that function is undefined
[01:16:47] <Krinkle> robbington: after that, should be "test"
[01:17:14] <Krinkle> console.log = function (msg) { _print_to_console(msg); };
[01:17:20] <Krinkle> default return value is undefined
[01:17:35] <Krinkle> try creating a function like this: function myLog(msg){ alert(msg); }
[01:17:41] <Krinkle> > myLog('test')
[01:17:43] <Krinkle> > undefined
[01:18:09] <jita> Can i delegate custom events which are not attached to the DOM using on or live handler ?
[01:18:38] <robbington> Krinkle: console.log('test') returns test in the console on other webpages, so it must be a bug in my code. Its a magento install.
[01:20:15] <robbington> But the only js I have added is some very simple jQuery, and that all functions as expected. Head scratcher
[01:29:27] <mikkelb> At https://gist.github.com/1992835 - anybody know how to simplify the JS?
[01:29:28] <mikkelb> (for what it's worth please accept http://files.me.com/joselopes/08bosu.mp3 as a token of my appreciation for your support)
[01:35:47] <Krinkle> ..

[01:49:28] <cpaq> I am having trouble with .on(), or live()
[01:54:42] <nights> how can i avoid having var responsehtml = $response.filter('#responsehtml').html(); strip out my script tags`??
[02:07:01] <cpaq>  anyone here?
[02:07:51] <astropirate> maybe
[02:07:52] <astropirate> maybe not
[02:14:14] <dk85> how would I set an image processed by supersized plugin to the background.  I'm using this tut with no luck:http://buildinternet.com/2009/02/supersized-full-screen-backgroundslideshow-jquery-plugin/
[02:16:09] <cpaq> http://jsfiddle.net/EfaQK/1/ why does this selector work? $('#buttonToDo > p')
[02:16:19] <cpaq> for .append("<div><p class='qwe'>Clicker</p></div>");
[02:51:17] <nights> god
[02:51:21] <nights> get rid of that fucking bot
[02:51:29] <mikkelb> hehe
[02:51:44] <nights> how many are there
[02:51:54] <nights> is this a disconnect attack?
[02:51:55] <nights> lol
[02:52:42] <nights> guess i need tochange to no display join-part
[03:21:54] <aro> has anyone used uniformjs? I am having a problem with a submit not being invoked
[03:25:04] <cpaq> See the script: http://jsfiddle.net/EfaQK/1/ Why doesn't the selector for "test two" work?
[03:28:36] <Woet> cpaq: you mean "#buttonToDo > p" ?
[03:28:55] <cpaq> Woet, yep, that selector isn't working
[03:29:10] <Woet> cpaq: because there is a div in there
[03:29:12] <QF-MichaelK> I think you're thinking css...
[03:29:18] <Woet> cpaq: "#buttonToDo div > p" works
[03:29:37] <QF-MichaelK> ... Wait, you can do that?
[03:29:42] <Woet> QF-MichaelK: sure, why not
[03:30:20] <QF-MichaelK> Huh, shows how much of a noob I am, everything I have is by class and id directly.
[03:31:33] <nights> WTFDTSW
[03:31:54] <nights> in success, does filter actually work at all?`
[03:31:59] <nights> i get absolutely nothing back
[03:32:02] <cpaq> Woet, you're right that works, but I have another script at it works the way I had for some reason, well, except instead of p its img
[03:32:05] <nights> ive tried a gazillion permutations
[03:32:21] <Woet> cpaq: there is a div around that img too?
[03:32:42] <Woet> cpaq: The child combinator (E > F) can be thought of as a more specific form of the descendant combinator (E F) in that it selects only first-level descendants.
[03:32:48] <cpaq> Woet, nope, yeah, I see what you are saying
[03:32:52] <Woet> :)
[03:32:54] <cpaq> Woet, thanks,
[03:33:10] <Woet> cpaq: "#buttonToDo p" works too
[03:33:35] <Woet> cpaq: but since you put a > there you explicitly tell jquery that it should only match the first level and not recurse
[03:34:03] <QF-MichaelK> Woet++ Thanks, that helped me too even though I didn't know I needed it. XP
[03:35:02] <dk85> any idea why my supersized (plugin) background shows up as just another image?? its even before my <h1> content
[03:37:29] <nights> anyone know how to in ajax success filter the response in two variables?
[03:37:37] <nights> i cant this SIMPLE thing to work
[03:37:50] <Woet> ?demo @ dk85
[03:37:54] <Woet> damn bot
[03:38:00] <aro> has anyone used uniformjs? I am having a problem with a submit not being invoked
[03:38:04] <Woet> dk85: please put it on www.jqfiddle.net or give a link to the site
[03:42:06] <cpaq> nights, try some of the string functions, but probably you are making a programming style that is no good
[03:44:34] <dk85> oh, the demo is meant to built from.  I was trying to build from the core.js file.  thx!
[03:45:55] <lenswipe> hey guys
[03:46:10] <lenswipe> is there a reason why: $('#finalform').submit(function() {}); should ignore my form submit?
[03:47:54] <cpaq> lenswipe, looks good, should work I'd guess
[03:48:02] <lenswipe> well it aint doing :p
[03:48:05] <lenswipe> want a live link?
[03:48:10] <cpaq> sure
[03:48:26] <lenswipe> http://95.146.91.167/bootstraptest/dashboard/imagegrid
[03:48:37] <lenswipe> its the form at the bottom of the page with just 1 button in it
[03:50:50] <cpaq> you have return false
[03:51:08] <cpaq> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[03:51:23] <cpaq> ...we can cancel the submit action by calling .preventDefault() on the event object or by returning false from our handler.
[03:51:47] <cpaq> lenswipe, "return false"
[03:53:19] <lenswipe> cpaq, it should still fire though
[03:53:30] <lenswipe> the return false is fired after the alert("");
[03:53:57] <cpaq> lenswipe, dunno, docs say otherwise, did you read the quote I posted above?
[03:54:04] <lenswipe> yeah
[03:54:11] <lenswipe> i took the return false; out and it still does nothing
[03:56:16] <lenswipe> cpaq, ^
[03:56:18] <cpaq> lenswipe, I dont see any #finalform element
[03:56:34] <lenswipe> ...?
[03:56:54] <lenswipe> cpaq, $('#finalform');
[03:56:56] <lenswipe> type that into console
[03:57:01] <cpaq> oh yeah
[03:57:07] <lenswipe> i assure you its there :)
[03:57:31] <cpaq> it submits for me
[03:57:40] <lenswipe> yeah
[03:57:47] <lenswipe> its supposed to show an alert() before it does
[03:57:51] <cpaq> and it submitted before too, when you had return false
[03:58:47] <cpaq> nope, I don't see any "boo"
[03:59:05] <lenswipe> exactly
[03:59:09] <lenswipe> see my problem?
[04:00:04] <cpaq> put alert in instead and see
[04:00:19] <lenswipe> wha?
[04:00:22] <lenswipe> i have alert
[04:00:26] <lenswipe> oh wait
[04:00:27] <lenswipe> ok
[04:00:48] <lenswipe> yep
[04:00:48] <lenswipe> nothin
[04:02:21] <cpaq> I don't know, I am just a newbie
[04:03:41] <yamama> Hello. I need some help on js "classes" , that fails http://jsfiddle.net/XwDv8/
[04:04:30] <johnkpaul> yamama: how does that code actualy run?
[04:04:34] <johnkpaul> I see the definition of two functions
[04:04:35] <yamama> what i'm trying to do is at creation time var = new myClass() a call is done to a function that does a $.get
[04:05:14] <johnkpaul> so yamama, that should happen
[04:05:17] <yamama> and i wonder if it is possible to handover to that function (ctrl_....) the callback function of the class
[04:05:34] <johnkpaul> "the callback function of the class"?
[04:05:36] <fris> anyway to combine 3 ajax functions into 1? each has a different action and classes, the function is identical except the class on click and the action
[04:05:56] <johnkpaul> yamama: functions don't have callback functions
[04:06:14] <yamama> sessionClass.initialise( objData )
[04:06:20] <johnkpaul> if you run var mySession = new sessionClass(), and ajax get should eb made
[04:06:29] <yamama> is used for in the $.get callback
[04:06:30] <johnkpaul> ah, initialise is your own function, it's not a constructor
[04:06:35] <yamama> that's waht i want to achieve
[04:06:43] <yamama> it's a constructor
[04:06:45] <johnkpaul> so you need to add the line this.initialise()
[04:06:49] <johnkpaul> in your constructo
[04:07:07] <yamama> but i have to wait for the $.get to complete before doing the this.initialise
[04:07:13] <johnkpaul> fris: you can add parameters
[04:07:47] <yamama> yes, i've done that, i call ctrl_... with parameters
[04:07:48] <johnkpaul> yamama: ah, then you need to understand how this works
[04:07:54] <johnkpaul> "this"
[04:07:57] <yamama> right :)
[04:07:58] <johnkpaul> !this @ yamama
[04:08:05] <johnkpaul> ?this @ yamama
[04:08:18] <johnkpaul> ha, i am always failing at the damn bot
[04:08:23] <Taktaal> bot died
[04:08:25] <yamama> :-)
[04:08:28] <yamama> amen
[04:08:36] <Taktaal> but yeah you kinda need to read a book about starting with js
[04:08:42] <Taktaal> and oop in general
[04:09:02] <johnkpaul> oh, I feel a lot better that the bots dead
[04:09:34] <johnkpaul> yes, yamama I agree with Taktaal, you need to learn the basics about oop in js and what "this" means
[04:09:46] <yamama> but is it feasable ? i'd like to use the same ctrl function for different classes, and let the class tell which of its methods the callback should use
[04:09:53] <Taktaal> besides, you dont need this, you need to use a closure
[04:10:04] <johnkpaul> yamama: yes, it is feasible
[04:10:09] <Masko>  Guys i have request which looks like this http://pastebin.com/s9UtvEq8
[04:10:15] <Masko> and I want to use ajax this is my code right now http://pastebin.com/ZzfyN2uC
[04:10:49] <Masko> problem is that I probably dont send same thing I just dont see how could I write my code differently.
[04:10:54] <yamama> could you help me on that one ? i promise to go in depth reading
[04:11:06] <johnkpaul> Taktaal: it depends on what the function utils_loadData does with the this reference
[04:11:37] <johnkpaul> yamama: in your .get() callback, try obj_callback.call(obj_caller)
[04:11:48] <johnkpaul> ?mdn call
[04:11:48] <caniuse> johnkpaul: call - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[04:13:16] <johnkpaul> Masko: what do you mean "I probably don't send the same thing"
[04:14:17] <Masko> johnkpaul: I mean that I sent post request using pure javascript and i sent request by one application. If I use application I get OK response when I use javascript I get errro 500 . Server code is same so I think that my request is bad
[04:14:45] <johnkpaul> so you keep getting the alert error in response?
[04:15:00] <Masko> johnkpaul: yes I get error 500
[04:15:12] <johnkpaul> so I don't think this is really a jquery question
[04:15:14] <yamama> ah, obj_callback.call(obj, objData) ? (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call)
[04:15:31] <johnkpaul> yes yamama
[04:15:39] <yamama> cheers.
[04:15:52] <johnkpaul> Masko: what is your backend?
[04:16:00] <Masko> rest api
[04:16:02] <johnkpaul> it is sending a not-200
[04:16:06] <Masko> yes
[04:16:15] <Masko> but only if I sent request using JS
[04:16:21] <Masko> i get 200 when I use program
[04:16:23] <yamama> any good book on js oop ?
[04:16:37] <johnkpaul> Masko: you need to inspect your backend to see the difference
[04:16:48] <Masko> johnkpaul: what do you mean? It is same in bode cases...
[04:16:51] <johnkpaul> yamama: there are many good blog posts out there
[04:16:54] <Masko> and I can't really debug backend
[04:17:02] <johnkpaul> many by Douglas crockford
[04:17:15] <johnkpaul> @yamama  http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html
[04:17:30] <yamama> thanks a lot
[04:17:35] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun!
[04:17:39] <yamama> i love the jquery team :-)
[04:17:48] <johnkpaul> :) most people in here aren't par t of the jquery team
[04:17:54] <johnkpaul> I'm not
[04:17:59] <johnkpaul> Masko: "bode cases"?
[04:18:06] <cpaq> I'm not
[04:18:15] <johnkpaul> Masko: if you don't have access to the backend, maybe get a http debugger on your machine
[04:18:16] <cpaq> I junior level jquery
[04:18:17] <johnkpaul> and compare the two requests
[04:18:28] <Masko> johnkpaul:  sorry both cases
[04:18:44] <johnkpaul> @Masko http://www.charlesproxy.com/
[04:19:11] <johnkpaul> I think that most people in these channels aren't actually core team members, just people who come and give and get help often
[04:19:45] <yamama> johnkpaul: ah, thought so. well thanks a lot. are you a freelancer, it's interesting to know who the good guys are ?
[04:20:32] <johnkpaul> yes yamama, feel free to PM
[04:22:28] <johnkpaul> Masko: I gave you something to look into, try that before starting an argument in ##javascript again ;)
[04:23:26] <Masko> johnkpaul:  heh yes but  I still worry that I would not be able to see difference i mean it's ridicously easy code I am seding one parameter I just don't see what I am doing wrong
[04:23:39] <Masko> johnkpaul: and don't worry with people there are there right now it would be waste of time.,
[04:23:54] <johnkpaul> yeah
[04:24:00] <johnkpaul> I think it's hard to see when you're just looking at parameters
[04:24:07] <johnkpaul> you're forgetting that an http request has much more than just the body entity
[04:24:15] <johnkpaul> you need to make sure that the headers match too
[04:24:25] <johnkpaul> and even if those match, potentially there are authentication stpes that your javascript isn't making
[04:24:27] <Masko> johnkpaul: yeap that could be the problem. because url and method is same..
[04:24:38] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's why the http proxy will help a lot
[04:24:53] <Masko> johnkpaul: I think not because I dot have whole server message and there is nothing about  autheticantion
[04:25:07] <Masko> but ok i will play a bit thx for that
[04:25:39] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun
[04:32:46] <Masko> johnkpaul:  btw problem seems to be in body because I get error that processdefinitionid is missing
[04:33:15] <Masko> and btw I used IE toobar for checking request .
[04:38:14] <erdos> is anyone familiar with the jquery slider widget? i want to make some modifications but i'm trying to figure whether it's possible or i should just write my own implementation from scratch?
[04:51:29] <johnkpaul> WHat are the modifications erkan
[04:51:35] <johnkpaul> oops, erdos

[05:43:56] <aqeel> hi room
[06:13:36] <jonkristian> Any way to slideup/down without affecting the windows, i mean when it slidesdown the browser windows jumps to the top.
[06:14:01] <jonkristian> also if i scroll a litle bit down, then click slideup it jumps to the top.
[06:14:09] <jonkristian> this is a hidden div

[06:37:23] <Aidanie> What's the best way to make a option in a SELECT menu the default option? I'm adding an option like so.. $('#mySelect').append($("<option></option>") .attr("value",key) .text(value);
[06:37:36] <Aidanie> I'd then like to make it the default option
[06:42:51] <Taktaal> <option default="default">whatever</option>
[06:43:07] <Taktaal> sorry, <option selected="selected">
[06:44:09] <Phrogz> Aidanie: Use       $('foo').append( new Option( text, value, selected, default ) );
[06:44:18] <Phrogz> where 'selected' and 'default' are booleans.
[06:44:42] <Phrogz> It's old school, but it's less typing.
[06:44:58] <Aidanie> Phrogz: thanks! :)
[06:50:09] <Phrogz> Aidanie: Whoops, I swapped those last two arguments.
[06:50:20] <Phrogz> It's actually new Option( text, value, defaultSelected, isSelected )
[06:52:07] <jacof> Hi guys. Say that I have this kind of layout: <div class="class">content</div><div class="class">content</div>, and I want to encapsule both of those divs (everything that has a class="class"), inside a <div id="id"></div>. Also, if possible, to implement some kind of security measure against having them encapsuled if they are not together or in different levels. Possible ?
[06:53:58] <Phrogz> jacof: Everything is possible.
[06:54:22] <Phrogz> What do you mean by "together"? Adjacent siblings? Sharing the same parent?
[06:54:55] <jacof> Phrogz: Both, possibly. If they are not "together", at least that they are sharing the same parent.
[06:55:05] <jacof> that should be my most permissive situation.
[06:55:43] <Phrogz> jacof: Do you know how to select all items with the same class? Iterate that collection? Test to see if their parents are the same? Find out who the next sibling or previous sibling node is?
[06:56:07] <Phrogz> There's no jQuery selector that does directly what you are asking for.
[06:57:01] <jacof> Phrogz: no but I should be able to look that up in the docs. Maybe you could tell me the basic idea and I can search the functions and the particulars myself.
[06:58:04] <Phrogz> $('.class') - get all elements with that class    .each(function(){ ... })  iterate over the collection of DOM nodes    this.parentNode
[06:58:57] <Phrogz> Or you can use .filter( to only include items that match a particular criteria.
[06:59:03] <jacof> hmm, but an iteration implies that I should be encapsuling EACH of the elements, whereas I want to encapsule all of them together.
[06:59:27] <Phrogz> jacof: a) Find them. b) Filter them. c) Encapsulate the matching results.
[06:59:46] <Phrogz> If you get 10 elements back, and they have 3 different parents, do you want to group each of those sets?
[07:00:01] <Phrogz> What if you get 2 back with different parents?
[07:00:27] * Phrogz likes the programming game.
[07:00:32] <jacof> I guess this isn't going to be time-effective. I'll use another approach. Thank you very much.
[07:00:42] * Phrogz hates the game where the rules are trying to elicit the requirements from the participants.
[07:00:56] <jacof> :)
[07:01:07] <jacof> I like the programming game too, but I'm on the road and I can use every second.
[07:01:18] <Phrogz> "isn't going to be time-effective" => "you didn't program it for me"?
[07:01:37] <Phrogz> jacof: Then for the love of all that's holy, get off of IRC! It will suck your life away :)
[07:02:00] <alexfreewalker> is there a way to reload a javascript file after ajax success?
[07:02:01] <jacof> Phrogz: No, its not like that. I can solve this much quickier using CSS and modifying some files.
[07:02:09] <gyaresu> Google maps markers ending up top left of screen using JQM. Any ideas? My SO question: http://tinyurl.com/gmapscenter
[07:02:11] <Phrogz> Gotcha. Good luck!

[07:40:51] <johnkpaul> using both of those, you can achieve the effect you're looking for

[07:43:32] <timwis> plln he's right though..what's the trouble
[07:43:52] <timwis> perhaps you're not cancelling the default action of enter (which would submit the form)

[07:45:27] <plln> \r\n <-- carriage return
[07:45:29] <johnkpaul> the keyup event for the enter key would be keyCode 13, not a string \n

[08:00:11] <plln> function (bla) { return bla*bla };
[08:00:12] <johnkpaul> at least try to do something before asking for help
[08:00:30] <timwis> i gave you the correct code plln
[08:00:31] <johnkpaul> !eval function(bla) {return bla*bla}; bla(10);
[08:00:33] <plln> because they are useless
[08:00:38] <johnkpaul> ?eval function(bla) {return bla*bla}; bla(10);
[08:00:41] <bot-t> johnkpaul: ReferenceError: bla is not defined
[08:00:48] <johnkpaul> ha, oops
[08:01:00] <johnkpaul> but you see plln, they are useless because you don't have any background in jquery yet
[08:01:04] <johnkpaul> did you read through that 101 tutorial I sent you
[08:01:54] <johnkpaul> wow, I've never really felt like _that_ guy on IRC before right now
[08:02:00] <johnkpaul> oh well, it's a saturday morning, I should be asleep
[08:02:05] <plln> yes i read
[08:02:35] <johnkpaul> ok good, so do you feel comfortable with trying to write some code to accomplish what you're looking for
[08:03:52] <chovy> if you write a function you get a cookie.
[08:04:02] <chovy> (no pun intended)

[08:05:39] <plln> 0x00 equal NULL, 0x65 equal in A 0x1B equal is ESC , 0XA equal enter
[08:05:46] <starsinmypockets> excuse me.. in doTimer(i)
[08:05:54] <johnkpaul> starsinmypockets: because when you use a string in settimeout it evaluates the code using eval in the global scope
[08:06:01] <johnkpaul> since your global scope has nov ariable named i, it is unefined

[08:06:42] <johnkpaul> ok, I'm giving up on you plln, I'm proud of you knowing C, but you need to learn the basics of web dev

[08:07:06] <starsinmypockets> johnkpaul - that link's busted.. it says account suspended lol
[08:07:07] <chovy> should't you do setTimeout(function(){ doTimer(i) }, 200);
[08:07:18] <plln> timwis: thank you for help but this function is only grabs enter
[08:07:29] <timwis> plln so make it grab another key
[08:07:39] <timwis> you can find the keycodes by googling jquery keypress keycodes
[08:07:51] <timwis> and make it test for multiple key codes in the if statement
[08:08:11] <timwis> if key is enter or key is control etc
[08:08:23] <plln> the key codes in array control key codes exmaple ctrl, esc, f12, f24, f25, f26, f27
[08:08:38] <timwis> plln i'm not going to do it for you
[08:08:39] <chovy> f27?
[08:08:43] <timwis> i already did that for you
[08:08:53] <chovy> i don't have f keys.
[08:08:55] <plln> for example if user press F12 KEY + CTRL  the key will now F24
[08:09:00] <timwis> google keycodes and test in the conditional. it's 99% done
[08:09:13] <chovy> why would anyone do that?
[08:09:19] <plln> if user press F12 Key + CTRL + Shift new key is F 36
[08:09:43] <plln> this is diffrence between being programmer or coder :)
[08:09:57] <timwis> In our country, we call that pressing ctrl+shift+f12
[08:10:06] <plln> for example on your phone
[08:10:24] <plln> the old phones are have only 15 key
[08:10:37] <plln> but functionalty is more than 15 key
[08:10:51] <starsinmypockets> chovy yeah that does it tx
[08:11:24] <plln> well my brother ctrl+shift+f12 :) thats a another combination :)
[08:13:42] <plln> i found

[08:26:16] <timwis> someus put this line in your <head> <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/1.4.0/bootstrap.min.css"/>
[08:26:24] <timwis> actually no that's an old version

[08:26:43] <timwis> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[08:26:54] <Someus> what`s that for?
[08:27:00] <timwis> include that css in your page and you'll have super easy styling

[09:45:05] <aqeel> well this is pure js...
[09:45:18] <aqeel> i want it to  be converted to jquery 1.7.1 too

[09:45:47] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[09:46:04] <Woet> aqeel: and how do you want to check for "window.load progress"?
[09:46:29] <aqeel> see under advancecontrol.js in source
[09:46:46] <Woet> yes, I saw that. same question.
[09:47:07] <aqeel> it is in pure js and i wouild like it to convert to jquery too and link to my contents...
[09:48:15] <aqeel> well i have .load() in my advancemenu.js file......and i would like the load() finished then process to my content page
[09:48:32] <Woet> aqeel: okay, and what is your actual question?
[09:49:48] <MerlinDE> Anyone here who can give me a hint on $.Callbacks?
[09:49:58] <aqeel> same how to make my progress process as the .load() is taking place on window.load().....and when load() indeed finished loading so will the progress bar and the page will be loaded
[09:50:22] <Woet> aqeel: .load taking place on window.load? what?
[09:50:51] <Woet> aqeel: we don't write code here for you. ask more specific questions, show the things you have attempted, the documentation you have read, etc.
[09:51:06] <aqeel> my ,load() loads content from external files into div and window.load() is when window has loaded all the content
[09:51:50] <Woet> aqeel: okay, so bind triggers to the onComplete callbacks and hide the progress bar once they're all done
[09:53:03] <aqeel> well i did all that and u r going off track.....thanks that is what i was asking
[09:53:28] <aqeel> i showed my example...
[09:53:51] <aqeel> asked specific quesation and only best methos of how to do it...not CODE

[10:19:37] <jrockjiggz> aqeel, no do not quote width:
[10:19:43] <aqeel> ok
[10:19:45] <b1lly> bar.css('width', +value+'%');
[10:19:53] <b1lly> get rid of the colin *:*
[10:21:57] <aqeel> b1lly, jrockjiggz...........both not working
[10:22:10] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/gnx6B/2/
[10:22:28] <b1lly> aqeel: dood, get rid of the COLIN
[10:22:43] <aqeel> i did still same
[10:23:05] <b1lly> var bar = $('#bar');
[10:23:17] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/gnx6B/3/
[10:23:28] <aqeel> ok
[10:23:51] <b1lly> aqeel: also, its bar.css('width', (value++) +'%');
[10:24:54] <ajpiano> do ++value if you want the incremented value to be used in the expression
[10:24:56] <ajpiano> not value++
[10:25:08] <aqeel> b1lly what is difference for [0] with/without
[10:25:19] <aqeel> ok...thanks
[10:25:26] <aqeel> now it indeed is working
[10:25:55] <aqeel> how come in regular style with js works with [0] but not in jquery
[10:27:30] <chovy> aqeel: jquery has a slighty different syntax
[10:28:11] <aqeel> ok...thanks
[10:37:15] <aqeel> jrockjiggz...b1lly.....chovy.......thanks.....here is something for you........http://jsfiddle.net/gnx6B/4/.................this working fine on my site.......jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[10:37:22] <aqeel> but not in jsfiddle...
[10:38:02] <aqeel> wait loading contents to site...
[10:39:37] <aqeel> ok have a look
[10:39:59] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[10:40:54] <unknown6> hey! how do i fix this problem? http://jsfiddle.net/z6nbt/
[10:45:12] <b1lly> aqeel so you created a fake preloader? :x
[10:45:47] <aqeel> at moment ......now linking the load process.......the moment the load finishes it will go to content page
[10:46:32] <aqeel> i have .load() which gets contents from external files....
[10:46:39] <b1lly> unknown6: the problem is, you need to reinitate the scroll
[10:46:50] <miket3> unknown6, this has something to do with live thingys....   I am not jquery expert... but take a look at delegate()
[10:47:04] <aqeel> after all load() is done the loading will lso finish...
[10:47:11] <aqeel> also*
[10:48:05] <aqeel> first with your help i made that pure js code into jquery and now linking with load() ......
[10:49:19] <unknown6> b1lly: how am i supposed to do that
[10:49:55] <p3rsist> Hi guys. I have a big div which is refreshed via ajax. All this html code is thus in the full php page and in the ajax php script. How do I avoid this code duplication?
[10:50:46] <unknown6> i'm not expert either. dunno because it creates inner span elements, and i don't know how to reinitiate them.
[10:50:59] <b1lly> p3rsist: use empty()
[10:57:38] <ian_> hey all - i'm looking for a way to determine whether or not any ajax functions are processing on a page at a given time? I have several long-running ajax operations and I want to hide certain elements while ajax is being processed. Any ideas?
[11:00:58] <p3rsist> b1lly: How using empty() will solve this problematic?
[11:01:26] <ian_> ooohh i just discovered $.active
[11:01:33] <ian_> that's nice
[11:02:00] <p3rsist> Ohh and I'm using 1.7.1 and I tried to replace the live("click", callback) by on.("click", callback) and it didn't work for newly created elements. Any explanations?
[11:10:49] <poppiez> I have this function that can be triggered from an event. what if I want to be able to call it directly? this is my current solution. I just think it sucks: http://pastie.org/private/fhsgi6mrz04td7rqssnftg
[11:11:51] <Majicpanda> anyone have suggestions for an interface where i have <a href="#" id="1/2/3/4" class="hotkey"> and .hotkey onClick fires off an ajax request .. i want to disable all .hotkey clicking until the ajax request comes back
[11:12:16] <Majicpanda> but i dont want to remove any of the hotkeys from the interface
[11:18:13] <arlink> $('.result').each(function (listing) {} what is listing? what heading does it fall under?
[11:19:26] <paissad> hello guys, i would like to generate this sort of checkbox input ---> <input type="checkbox" name="hello_world" value="hello_world" />Hello World<br />
[11:19:26] <paissad> here is what i did http://pastebin.com/7yPXNY71
[11:19:26] <paissad> but only only the 1st input is created ... and not entirely/correctly
[11:19:34] <paissad> here is input created ---> <input class="loc_0">
[11:19:55] <paissad> the attributes are not set, .. the text neither .. and so forth
[11:20:33] <paissad> what did i do wrong in my jquery code ?
[11:22:04] <pen> hey
[11:22:06] <pen> https://github.com/macek/jquery-to-json/blob/master/jquery.to_json.js
[11:22:15] <pen> how do I use this? it returned some empty object
[11:22:21] <pen> from a form
[11:22:28] <pen> I used console.log to print the return value
[11:22:43] <pen> I thought it returns json but it doesn't
[11:25:08] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman serializeObject @ pen
[11:25:09] <bot-t> pen, Ben Alman » jQuery Misc plugins - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/
[11:25:15] <ajpiano> use that to get an object from the form
[11:25:19] <ajpiano> and then see see ?stringify
[11:25:20] <bot-t> JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[11:25:22] <ajpiano> to make it into json
[11:25:23] <pen> ok
[11:28:58] <pen> ajpiano: well, it only do one level, I have multiple levels
[11:29:06] <pen> ajpiano: and some arrays too
[11:29:07] <ajpiano> you have forms nested inside of forms?
[11:29:24] <pen> ajpiano: no
[11:29:39] <pen> ajpiano: if you use rails you usually use the form as an abstraction of an object
[11:29:46] <arlink> $('.result').each(function (listing) {} does anyone know what the listing parameter is?
[11:29:50] <pen> ajpiano: so you have namespace, like name[property]
[11:30:07] <pen> ajpiano: then { 'name': { 'property': value } }
[11:30:08] <ajpiano> pen:  oh
[11:30:09] <pen> something like that
[11:30:30] <ajpiano> the plugin you linked
[11:30:35] <ajpiano> makes an object, not a json string
[11:30:47] <pen> ajpiano: then is it possible to make it into a string?
[11:30:56] <ajpiano> arlink: it's the index
[11:31:01] <ajpiano> the second arg is the element itself
[11:31:09] <ajpiano> pen:  using JSON.stringify
[11:31:14] <pen> ajpiano: oh ok
[11:31:28] <arlink> oh
[11:34:01] <pen> ajpiano: thanks, now I see something now :D
[11:35:14] <pen> ajpiano: I was using this https://github.com/maxatwork/form2js/ although it claims that it supports ruby style, it doesn't work actually
[11:35:24] <pen> a little disappointed
[11:39:01] <arlink> http://pastebin.com/tuP6vXLm if i remove listing from title = $('h2 a', listing).fulltext; would project contain a single 'a' tag or all of them?
[11:39:38] <aqeel> all a falling under h2
[11:40:54] <aqeel> but each has one benefit over this it will select INDIVIDUAL thus not conflicting with regular selective method
[11:41:58] <ajpiano> arlink: this will fail for so many different reasons
[11:42:33] <ajpiano> arlink: "listing" will be a number, not an element
[11:42:40] <arlink> right
[11:42:41] <ajpiano> furthermore, you should just use .map
[11:43:09] <helder_raptor> want to hide text in <input type="text" value="enter text">. want to remove "enter text" when clicked
[11:43:15] <ajpiano> furthermore, $("anyjQueryObject") will not have a .fulltext property
[11:44:05] <arlink> i did come upon the fulltext error. i changed .fulltext to .text()
[11:44:41] <arlink> but lets say the code did work. if i remove listing would i still capture all the 'a' tags?
[11:44:43] <ajpiano> arlink: http://pastebin.com/Ktc7uxkg
[11:44:54] <ajpiano> it would capture all of them
[11:44:56] <ajpiano> in the entire dom

[12:01:34] <xboi209> can anyone help me?
[12:07:54] <miket3> mikkelb, still need help?
[12:08:22] <xboi209> I do :/
[12:08:59] <mikkelb> miket3: yep
[12:09:03] <mikkelb> recap:
[12:09:14] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/mCT6G/7/ - anybody know why #shipping-address won't drop down when you select "Enter separate shipping address"?
[12:09:18] <mikkelb> http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/mCT6G/5/ works, but I don't think it was using "value" properly?
[12:10:18] <miket3> mikkelb, your selector cant find a match
[12:11:29] <mikkelb> miket3: damn..
[12:11:34] <mikkelb> i thought i'd work that way
[12:11:46] <mikkelb> miket3: is it wrong to use value="1" and value="0" like that?
[12:11:50] <xboi209> if i had something like <a id='hello'></a> how would I use $("").after("");  in this situation?
[12:12:25] <miket3> mikkelb, whats wrong with your second example?
[12:13:35] <miket3> it works ok for me.  other than the the shipping adress not hiding on the slideup
[12:13:51] <timme> hi
[12:16:37] <mikkelb> miket3: well some "expert" helped integrate the second example with rails..
[12:16:43] <mikkelb> miket3: came out looking like the 1st one
[12:23:53] <sarspazam> anyone able to check and see why this jQuery isn't centering div?
[12:23:53] <sarspazam> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21571136/CentredDiv.html
[12:24:21] <sarspazam> would have fiddled but not sure it'd work well considering I'm setting div height to that of windw
[12:26:00] <miket3> mikkelb, what are u trying to fix?
[12:27:13] <dabear> sarspazam: set a breakpoint on each line and check if each step does what you think
[12:27:32] <dabear> google for "dev tools breakpoint"
[12:27:48] <sarspazam> i've used chromes
[12:28:10] <gf3> croams
[12:30:35] <poppiez> I have this function that can be triggered from an event. what if I want to be able to call it directly? this is my current solution. I just think it sucks: http://pastie.org/private/fhsgi6mrz04td7rqssnftg
[12:32:37] <Agbeladem> Hi, is it okay to put javascript in the middle of <body> so you can do things before $(document).ready ?
[12:33:14] <felixqc> how can i modify the buttons of a jqueryui dialog?
[12:34:27] <jrockjiggz> Agbeladem: its ok
[12:34:32] <PyRSqr> how can i determine if the <enter> key was pressed on a submit event like   $(id).submit(function(event) {));    ?
[12:34:53] <Agbeladem> jrockjiggz: so are there like W3C rules to do that in a clean way ?
[12:34:57] <jrockjiggz> Agbeladem: but you can put things in the head before $(document).ready()
[12:35:18] <sarspazam> what does (jQuery) at the end of code mean
[12:35:26] <sarspazam> seems to be something only done with older jquery
[12:36:21] <jrockjiggz> PyRSqr: google that shit!
[12:36:28] <jrockjiggz> if(key....
[12:36:30] <jrockjiggz> e.key
[12:36:32] <jrockjiggz> something
[12:36:34] <Agbeladem> jrockjiggz: true, but I need to do stuff on dom elements but my page is taking too long to open (so the actions I need occur after a tong time)
[12:36:44] <PyRSqr> e.key does not work on a submit event
[12:37:22] <jrockjiggz> but. you can $(document).click( function(e){ if(e.key == something){ $('form').submit(); });
[12:37:43] <jrockjiggz> i totally did that wrong, but you can $('form').submit() which will trigger submit
[12:37:51] <jrockjiggz> or $('form').trigger('submit')
[12:44:32] <mikkelb> miket3: im trying to fix the first example
[12:44:37] <mikkelb> the /7/
[12:50:40] <sarspazam> usually when I do a check to make sure DOMs ready I'll do $(document).ready(function(){
[12:50:44] <sarspazam> however I've got some code atm
[12:51:02] <sarspazam> where it all breaks unless the document is in apostrophes
[12:54:50] <eternicode> sarspazam, try $(function(){
[12:55:21] <sarspazam> yeah that's just shorthand of the same right?
[12:55:27] <sarspazam> also this line:  (function ($)
[12:55:30] <sarspazam> is that the same again?
[12:55:39] <eternicode> should be, yeah, but doesn't depend on the "document" variable
[12:55:51] <eternicode> no, that's different.
[12:58:15] <jrockjiggz> exaple: jQuery( function(custom$Flag){ //would le met do:     custom$Flag('body').remove()   });
[13:01:06] <miket3> mikkelb, http://jsfiddle.net/zrLkq/
[13:04:11] <mikkelb> miket3: wow :D
[13:04:21] <mikkelb> man this is really cool
[13:07:28] <miket3> mikkelb, better version http://jsfiddle.net/zrLkq/2/
[13:07:47] <miket3> slideup and slidedown work better on div than on fieldset
[13:08:14] <miket3> so i enclosed the fieldset in its own div and point the selectors to that
[13:09:25] <mikkelb> interesting man
[13:09:36] <mikkelb> in what way do they work better on divs though miket3 ?
[13:09:55] <miket3> in my fiddle   the shipping form wasnt clearing
[13:10:25] <miket3> maybe it was in yours
[13:10:33] <miket3> i am using FF browser
[13:10:59] <mikkelb> using FF myself
[13:11:04] <mikkelb> didnt test whether it was clearing though
[13:11:15] <mikkelb> man i owe you one
[13:11:45] <miket3> good luck.... i just did it for a learning experience
[13:11:56] <miket3> i had no idea what i was doing
[13:12:07] <miket3> well  a little idea
[13:12:20] <miket3> i just like to give back because so many people help me
[13:12:45] <mikkelb> haha no idea???
[13:12:55] <miket3> these chat rooms are PRICELESS
[13:12:56] <mikkelb> yeah..
[13:13:05] <mikkelb> thanks to you im gonna have to do the same thing soon
[13:13:15] * mikkelb is probably like miket3 2-3 years ago
[13:13:19] <mikkelb> miket3: i know right??
[13:13:30] <mikkelb> if it wasnt for these type of rooms.. i dont know, i'd have no hope of becoming someone
[13:13:49] <mikkelb> i'd have no hope of earning my millions and showing my family, who doesnt have a dime to their names, what life is really about
[13:13:55] <mikkelb> hell yeah these rooms are PRICELESS
[13:14:01] <mikkelb> but its because of people like you miket3

[13:35:51] <poppiez> I have this function that can be triggered from an event. what if I want to be able to call it directly? this is my current solution. I just think it sucks: http://pastie.org/private/fhsgi6mrz04td7rqssnftg
[13:37:00] <seltar> how about e && e.stopPropagation()
[13:37:11] <seltar> and e && e.preventDefault();

[13:51:46] <Hawkee> is there any reason my parse function wouldn't be getting called here: http://pastebin.com/Mp2ePE8C
[13:52:05] <Hawkee> I see the request on my apache log so I know it's hitting the source
[13:52:09] <Hawkee> but parse just doesn't fire
[13:52:11] <cpaq> I don't know if this question is relevant to this channel, but I am trying to use the .live() or .on() and .append() methods with the jcart shopping cart by conceptlogic.com, and if I append a product which is encapsulated in a <form> element, my page work as expected, ie. add-to-cart works and it updates via ajax, but it I use .append() the same <form> element for a product using a .live() or .on() handler, and then .append() the product upda
[13:52:11] <cpaq> tes the shopping cart, but not via ajax, the page reloads instead.  Anyone willing to take a look please?
[13:54:12] <cpaq> so, .append("<form>...</form"); works fine, but .on('click', function() { append("<form>...</form>"); breaks the jcart's ajax functionality
[13:54:14] <Hawkee> I'm using jquery UI, maybe this code is not for the UI version
[13:54:58] <seltar> cpaq: are you perhaps missing an e.preventDefault() on the click?
[13:55:44] <cpaq> seltar, I a missing that, I never heard of it, where would I put that, what would it do?
[13:56:14] <seltar> it would prevent the default click action of the button, and you would stick it in the live or on click function
[13:56:52] <seltar> .on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $("#something").append("<form>...</form>"); });
[13:57:23] <seltar> should/could also just return false at the end
[13:58:56] <cpaq> seltar, what if I weren't using a button, suppose I have in html <p class='doit'>uio</p>, and in script I had $('p.doit').on('click', function(){ .append("<form>...</form>"); then would you still recommed to preventDefault/
[13:59:11] <seltar> no, then that's not needed
[13:59:22] <seltar> but the .append, you do have something in front of that?
[13:59:28] <cpaq> seltar, yeah
[13:59:35] <seltar> just checkin ;)
[13:59:50] <seltar> stuff as much of the code in a jsfiddle, and i'll have a look
[13:59:52] <cpaq> seltar, like $('#somediv').append();
[14:00:06] <cpaq> seltar, how about a link to the forum?
[14:00:43] <cpaq> seltar,
[14:00:46] <cpaq> seltar, http://conceptlogic.com/jcart/help/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2298

[14:01:22] <poppiez> seltar: nice. I like that solution. thx
[14:01:33] <cpaq> seltar, would prefer to see it in jsfiddle?
[14:03:53] <seltar> poppiez: no problem :)

[14:14:05] <jonkristian> Hi, I have a problem, when expanding a div the browser windows scrolls to the top, any way to avoid this?
[14:15:14] <snover> yeah, donâ€™t create a link with href="#"
[14:15:47] <jonkristian> ah
[14:15:59] <jonkristian> snover: thanks, also what is the proper way to do this?
[14:16:07] <jonkristian> just empty a, or something else?
[14:16:20] <snover> thatâ€™ll do
[14:16:40] <jonkristian> but probably not good for validation
[14:16:52] <jonkristian> what if i prevent default and use hashmark?
[14:17:03] <timwis> snover: sometimes empty <a>s don't register as links on the browser, ie cursor is not pointer
[14:17:09] <iande> if you prevent default, it should stop the jumping
[14:17:15] <jonkristian> ok thanks guys
[14:17:29] <snover> timwis: a { cursor: pointer; } fixed that for you.
[14:20:49] <jonkristian> hm, function(e) { .... e.preventDefault(); didn't fix it
[14:22:04] <cpaq> jonkristian, don't use a link, and use css to make some kind of animation on hover, to it is easily identifiable as a link
[14:23:09] <jonkristian> cpaq: ok i guess
[14:23:18] <cpaq> jonkristian, or you can try href='#somediv' to make it scroll to where you would prefer instead
[14:23:28] <jonkristian> cpaq: ah good idea
[14:23:34] <cpaq> jonkristian, but I usually don't use the link if I am staying on same page
[14:24:40] <jonkristian> i see
[14:24:58] <jonkristian> i was thinking if js is disabled the link should go to a page
[14:25:16] <jonkristian> but how often will that happen:D
[14:25:25] <cpaq> jonkristian, yeah, you are probably right, I am not saying my way is best, I guess I am lazy
[14:25:32] <iande> if you return false; from the click handler, doesn't that generally prevent the link action as well?
[14:25:51] <jonkristian> iande: yes i think so, didn't thnk of that to begin with
[14:25:53] <jonkristian> will try
[14:26:18] <jonkristian> however i think maybe i read somewhere that preventDefault() is better, but can't remember for sure
[14:26:25] <cpaq> jonkristian, I don't program my pages for javascript disabled browsers, I mean I heard you are supposed to do that, but who is disabling it these day, majority of sites use javascript, maybe gov't offices are disabling it, but I don't care about them
[14:26:26] <iande> not sure if it's the preferred way of handling it in jQuery or not
[14:27:30] <iande> seems like preventDefault should have worked
[14:27:33] <jonkristian> cpaq: me to, however in some cases 'crucial' like for instance webshops i always think about this.
[14:28:03] <jonkristian> but this is not a webshop, so i will just use cursor: pointer; and put it straight on the li
[14:28:30] <cpaq> seems like way too much work, its easier just to make two sites, than follow that whole approach, I forget what they a call it, but you know what a mean, add javascipt in a way that if site has it disable it still work
[14:29:15] <iande> graceful degradation
[14:29:43] <jonkristian> haha
[14:29:44] <cpaq> iande, thats probably one of the names, but I remember reading something else
[14:31:04] <iande> progressive enhancement was another I've heard used
[14:31:23] <cpaq> I mean, if you write a site with just html/css, and then start adding javascript, you end up overwriting you css, so...
[14:31:28] <cpaq> iande, yeah, I think that's it
[14:32:35] <cpaq> Have you ever seen those adverts, they say, we can't pay you, but you can share in profits?
[14:32:50] <iande> heh
[14:33:38] <cpaq> Or some people say, we need "proof of concept" before we can pay.  I tell them bring me a $20 gift in cash when we meet, and then $200 payment to get started if you wish to hire me
[14:34:05] <iande> I generally take them to mean "you're working for free, enjoy!"
[14:34:44] <cpaq> Otherwise, I mean, if someone doesn't pay, I don't know how to send it to collections like big businesses do
[14:35:08] <iande> hmm, I'm still a bit bothered by jonkristian's issue with the click event
[14:35:50] <iande> preventDefault should work, it's the example given in the jQuery docs for .preventDefault()
[14:36:23] <cpaq> I went out of town to the neighbor city to meet one lady who didn't even show up, and I did the same to meet this store whom I replied to advert for web design, and he goes, the website is done already, I need you to sell some stuff on ebay for me
[14:36:43] <iande> nice
[14:36:53] <cpaq> iande, I don't know, using .preventDefault() seems like circular reasoning, if you don't want link actions then don't use a link
[14:37:06] <iande> I don't disagree with your point
[14:37:31] <iande> I'm just saying that functionally it should have done what was expected
[14:37:48] <cpaq> iande, you'd say using href links has major advantage to say $('#someid').click...
[14:37:50] <iande> unless he wasn't binding to 'click' or there's another handler in there
[14:38:06] <iande> not necessarily
[14:38:12] <jonkristian> selector was a and i was using click
[14:39:22] <cpaq> or just don't put href="#" because that will always scroll to the top element -body I guess right?
[14:39:27] <iande> if it makes sense for it to be a link, but you want to do something special, like send the request through AJAX instead of doing a full page load, then I'd prefer the <a>
[14:40:11] <iande> but for showing/hiding additional content on the page, it probably makes more sense to just bind to 'click' on an arbitrary element
[14:40:23] <cpaq> I don't know why, but if I am making some actions on the page I am on, it does't occur to me to use an anchor
[14:40:54] <iande> right
[14:41:25] <iande> it probably only makes sense when there's some semantic value in using the a
[14:41:25] <cpaq> I mean using an anchor is just as well, and I can't say one way is better, but I usually use a <p> or <span> or <div>
[14:41:36] <iande> right
[14:41:37] <cpaq> iande, yeah true
[14:42:21] <iande> for tabs (e.g., jQueryUI's tabs), I'd probably use an <a> with fragment href's
[14:42:35] <jonkristian> Not sure why i chose to use the actually, I think it's just something I have gotten used to without thinking about why.
[14:42:40] <iande> but only if the tag system can parse the fragment and show the appropriate tab
[14:42:53] <iande> so that you can share a link right to the appropriate tab
[14:43:16] <cpaq> But if I did you an anchor, arbitrarily, and it scrolled to the top, and I was like, that sucks, I would just replace href=# with nothing and move on.  Like <a>clickme</a>
[14:43:48] <iande> of course, that doesn't necessitate an 'a', just properly id'd elements
[14:44:11] <iande> yeah, I definitely see your point
[14:44:18] <jonkristian> yeah, however now that i've thought some more about it, it seems logical to add an url in there. The expanded div contains a form, now if js is off then the user should be able to fill out the form on another page.
[14:44:39] <iande> if you're going to preventDefault, and the href is meaningless, then there's no real reason to use an anchor to begin with
[14:44:41] <jonkristian> it's like an inline editor to add content
[14:45:45] <iande> good point cpaq, I actually hadn't given that much thought
[14:46:28] <jonkristian> i wonder who came up with the # in the first place, and why:D
[14:46:31] <cpaq> iande, thanks, hehe, you made my day
[14:46:49] <iande> haha, np
[14:48:46] <t4nkd> hey jquery, in a .each with json data from a get -- is there any easy way to assert that the attribute is an object, isn't null, has a length property, and is length-ier than 0?
[14:49:31] <jonkristian> != undefined ?
[14:49:52] <jonkristian> not sure tho
[14:50:03] <iande> you can use javascript's "falsey" treatment of nulls/undefineds
[14:50:22] <iande> (obj && obj.length && obj.length > 0)
[14:50:29] <t4nkd> hrm, sounds promising at least
[14:50:33] <iande> if you know obj.length is non-negative, you can skip the last bit
[14:50:42] <cpaq> iande, I have a tricky one that seltar tried to help me with but it was to much work if you please, check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/GGn6R/ Basically, to two big appends are the same, but the bottom one is triggered by .on() and in which case ajax fails, for the jcart Shopping Cart program by Conceptlogic.com
[14:50:59] <t4nkd> data.attr will return false if undefined or null?
[14:51:12] <t4nkd> or well, will assert to false
[14:51:13] <t4nkd> ?
[14:51:20] <iande> no, it returns null or undefined, but boolean operators treat them as "falsey"
[14:51:30] <t4nkd> sweet
[14:51:48] <t4nkd> and data.length = 0 is falsey as well
[14:51:48] <t4nkd> ?
[14:52:50] <iande> 0 is a falsey value
[14:53:00] <iande> if(0) { /* this never gets executed */ }
[14:53:08] <t4nkd> oh I see :D
[14:56:04] <iande> cpaq: okay, seems to be working
[14:56:24] <iande> though I had to switch from MooTools to jQuery in jsfiddle heh
[14:56:30] <cpaq> iande, i was thinking about it, it is too much to ask
[14:57:15] <cpaq> iande, you'd have read papes of code, which even I didn't bother to do, so I can't ask you, maybe the forum will help me, I posted it there too
[14:57:28] <iande> okay
[14:57:37] <iande> well, if you change your mind, feel free to bring it up again
[14:57:40] <iande> if not, then good luck :)
[14:57:47] <cpaq> iande, see the first append, it work, you can't tell on the jsfiddle, but the second one reloads the page
[14:59:59] <iande> ahh
[15:00:04] <cpaq> iande, see at my server http://24.36.14.57/jcart-test/jcart-1.3/ how the first three appended products load into the cart via ajax, but the .on() three products do not, the page reloads, that's my problem, I want to get ajax for the jcart working for .on('click', function(){ .append() working too
[15:01:03] <iande> I'll take a look at it and see if I come up with anything
[15:02:11] <cpaq> iande, I wanna mention something really quick, and then I will code it up so you can see for yourself too, but if I include the <form> </form> on the page, and then .on() .append() all the inner elements of the product, then the ajax works
[15:02:47] <iande> hmm
[15:02:50] <iande> interesting
[15:03:32] <cpaq> iande, I am gonna code it up too, so ensure what I said is correct
[15:04:13] <iande> k
[15:04:28] <iande> shoot me a message when you're ready
[15:08:30] <aaairc> is there a way to do a check to see if an img has loaded?
[15:08:36] <eddiemonge> .load?
[15:08:38] <aaairc> fully loaded
[15:08:59] <eddiemonge> ?load
[15:08:59] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[15:09:21] <aaairc> eddiemonge: yeah but i don't want it to bind an event
[15:09:29] <aaairc> i just want to check if it is loaded
[15:09:56] <aaairc> i want to be able to keep calling the checking function multiple times to see if the img is loaded at different points in time
[15:10:05] <aaairc> if it isn't i do something, if it is i do something else
[15:10:12] <aaairc> and i don't want to bind an event every time i check
[15:10:23] <aaairc> becaue then i'll end up with 100 different things bound to my img
[15:10:28] <aaairc> (i think thats how it works)
[15:11:48] <aaairc> eddiemonge: do you get what i'm saying?
[15:13:02] <aaairc> i guess i can unbind the event after
[15:13:23] <aaairc> the image is successfully loaded, so i can rebind it later when i need to check .load again
[15:15:03] <aaairc> you think this would work, to only bind the event once?
[15:15:04] <aaairc> $(obj).one('load', function)
[15:17:29] <cpaq> iande, ok, see the server now, you will see, the new append via clicking append, works with ajax, mostly, there is a type somewhere, but it works, just the tool tip isn't popping up for some reason
[15:19:35] <iande> huh
[15:19:41] <iande> incidentally, both work for me
[15:19:59] <iande> the clicker doesn't appear to be doing a page reload for me
[15:20:13] <iande> what browser are you seeing this with?
[15:20:43] <cpaq> iande, if you hit clicker, the three product pop up below, and if you click 'add to cart', the page reloads, all others don't
[15:20:53] <cpaq> chrome, ff
[15:21:06] <iande> ahh, okay
[15:21:07] <iande> I gotcha
[15:21:40] <iande> you can probably use a delegate or live to correct that
[15:22:12] <iande> let me take a stab at something
[15:22:26] <cpaq> http://jsfiddle.net/GGn6R/ if you see here, if I include the <form ...> in the html and then only append the inner code, then ajax works too
[15:22:36] <cpaq> .on() is the new version of .live()
[15:24:56] <iande> right, but that's for the clicker event
[15:25:35] <iande> it's the form.submit event that's giving causing the issue..
[15:25:42] <iande> is that handled in the jcart?
[15:26:24] <cpaq> iande, yeah probably
[15:27:11] <iande> yeah
[15:28:05] <iande> the form submit is run once... I think this can be solved
[15:28:15] <iande> well, I'm sure it can be solved :P
[15:28:19] <cpaq> iande, someone mentioned in the forms to change in the jcart.js  $('.jcart').submit(function(e) { ---to--- $('.jcart').live('submit',function(e) { but it didn't work for me
[15:28:36] <cpaq> iande, sorry mentioned in the forums
[15:29:23] <eddiemonge> dont use live anymore
[15:29:42] <cpaq> eddiemonge, yep, I use .on() now
[15:29:56] <iande> http://jsfiddle.net/GGn6R/3/
[15:29:59] <iande> it's not optimal
[15:30:06] <iande> but I added a bit to the appender function
[15:30:37] <iande> that can be better refined, because as it is, every time the clicker is clicked, it'll add handlers to already existing forms, which you probably don't want
[15:30:45] <iande> but it should point you in the right direction
[15:31:58] <eddiemonge> dont append things in loops
[15:32:24] <iande> granted, if jcart changes their interface, that code may break
[15:32:34] <iande> er.. yeah, totally ignore that, that code is crap
[15:32:46] <eddiemonge> id give you a better example but pizza time
[15:35:14] <cpaq> yeah, I heard that you shouldn't append things in for loops but I can't image how else to do it
[15:39:04] <cpaq> In the worse case scenario, I could just include a bunch of empty <form method='post' action='' class='jcart' id='one'></form> with id's one to ten depending on how many I expect to require, and then just fill them up using append via an on, which will work
[15:39:08] <iande> I don't see a good way to do it without modifying the jcart code
[15:39:30] <iande> right, because they're available when jchart does it's magic
[15:39:54] <Ziggy> I'm looking for a image slider that shows 3+ images at each time, the main one in the center, and the 2 others left and right to the main one, making the images fit all over the screen, dependant on screen size, Any suggestions?
[15:40:04] <cpaq> iande, yeah, thats the only way to do it, somewhere in the jcart it has to be able to handle form elements that are loaded from .on() trigger handler
[15:40:45] <cpaq> Ziggy, you can do it in sliderjs
[15:41:29] <cpaq> Ziggy, or slidejs, i think this one is better
[15:42:15] <iande> https://gist.github.com/2014025
[15:43:05] <cpaq> iande, ok, lets see
[15:44:18] <iande> it's a shame they don't offer a way to manually link up a form
[15:45:24] <Ziggy> cpaq: I don't see an example for sliderjs nor slidejs
[15:45:34] <iande> the library is pretty small though, so it's not a huge deal to modify it, I gues
[15:45:35] <cpaq> iande, yeah, it would be better if you could load products dynamically
[15:46:17] <cpaq> iande, yeah, I will have to read it through, it not to big, so I will try that eventually
[15:46:28] <cpaq> Ziggy, I will show you, 1 sec
[15:47:59] <cpaq> Ziggy, See the simple case http://slidesjs.com/examples/simple/ here you just have div's, so you can easily style up 3 images side by side inside a div can't you?
[15:50:33] <Ziggy> cpaq: Well, pretty much depends on the screen size, Let's say my screen is 1280px, and the main image is 980px, I'd like 145px of left image and 145px right image to be seen, and then let it slide over to the next one.. in a loop, but this may differ from screen sizes, so I can't really define them..
[15:50:47] <Brunoz> Ziggy: i can get you one
[15:51:10] <eddiemonge> cpaq: you create a string or worst case, a dom fragment, then you append to that in the loop. once the loop is done, you append the combined str/fragment to the dom
[15:52:35] <Ziggy> Brunoz: share it..
[15:53:14] <cpaq> eddiemonge, yes, I know exactly what you mean, so just one append happens, but you know, I append on a loop that does 50 appends, and it wors pretty fast
[15:54:31] <Brunoz> gimme a min so i can make it and commit the project to github :P
[15:54:54] <cpaq> Ziggy, you arelooking for something else, what you want is roundabout
[15:56:28] <zatan> Hi, how can i say, that if user using IE do not run this javscript bit http://jsfiddle.net/dEAus/ ?
[15:56:41] <eddiemonge> cpaq: its also extremely slow compared to one append
[16:00:54] <Ziggy> cpaq: http://jsfiddle.net/GGR5J/1/ - This is what I've found, but I need the center image to be larger.
[16:01:09] <Ziggy> Brunoz: This is a solution I've found, but doesn't do everything I need.
[16:01:27] <Brunoz> ahum
[16:01:36] <Brunoz> I'm doing some code right know
[16:02:08] <Brunoz> I'm doing a lil changes on flex slider plugin
[16:08:55] <macmartine> Should this work? https://gist.github.com/2014161
[16:13:47] <ringoAWAY> zatan, you want to detect the useragent string
[16:13:48] <Brunoz> Done it
[16:14:03] <Brunoz> one minute more to send
[16:14:04] <Brunoz> :s
[16:14:15] <ringoAWAY> it's not always reliable, but probably good enough for what you need
[16:14:26] <zatan> ringoAWAY, thats right
[16:15:02] <ringo_> you might be able to use jquery's feature detection instead
[16:15:28] <ringo_> which is a better way of doing it
[16:15:50] <ringo_> check out the feature test library modernizr
[16:15:53] <Ziggy> Brunoz: Alright
[16:16:31] <zatan> ringo_, cheers
[16:16:54] <ringo_> good luck
[16:18:22] <ringo_> macmartine, what is #{id}
[16:18:36] <ringo_> how is that getting set
[16:19:02] <macmartine> ringo_: ah, it's a parameter: showAppts : (id)
[16:19:17] <ringo_> in what language
[16:19:18] <macmartine> ringo_: $(event.target).data("id")
[16:20:29] <macmartine> ringo_: doh, i used a rails snippet in jquery. thanks. long day :)
[16:20:36] <ringo_> oh
[16:20:47] <Brunoz> http://www.mediafire.com/?yzb5oqw3qvr0rc8
[16:20:54] <Brunoz> its something like this?
[16:21:05] <ringo_> that doesn't seem right to me
[16:21:28] <Prookie|> hi
[16:21:41] <ringo_> hold on
[16:23:04] <Ziggy> Brunoz: Not really, but thanks for the effort.. I could possibly draw this up to show it.
[16:23:26] <Brunoz> plz
[16:23:27] <ringo_> actually, it looks ok
[16:23:38] <ringo_> i assume it doesn't work tho?
[16:23:41] <ringo_> macmartine
[16:23:50] <macmartine> ringo_: no it doesn't
[16:24:30] <ringo_> just an idea, but can you change the attribute name from data-id to something without a hyphen
[16:25:01] <macmartine> ringo_: that's how the data attributes work
[16:25:14] <ringo_> it seems like that would be the issue
[16:25:30] <macmartine> nevermind, i got it.
[16:25:43] <ringo_> what was it
[16:25:45] <macmartine> ringo_: but fyi http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[16:26:11] <macmartine> ringo_: i needed to change the attr on ther parent of that object
[16:27:32] <ringo_> ok, do'nt understand, but that's ok
[16:46:42] <denom> I'm looking at a jquery XHR deferred to track a DELETE request. I see the request return a 200 in my debugger, but when I call `deferred.isResolved()` I get false is this correct behavior?
[16:47:31] <denom> ahh, I see `isResolved` is deprecated
[16:47:59] <denom> the `state()` function returns 'pending'
[17:05:59] <Whirl3d> in looking up the api for $.each(), there is no explanation of the form $.each(lst, function (index) {});  could someone explain how $.each works with respect to an array of strings rather than dom elements?
[17:07:23] <seltar> $.each(["a","b","c"], function(i, val){ console.log(i, val); });
[17:07:41] <seltar> outputs 0 "a", 1 "b", 2 "c"
[17:08:33] <Whirl3d> seltar, thanks for the reply. What is "this" inside the function?
[17:08:44] <epistax> Any advantage to doing that over a for-each loop?
[17:09:09] <seltar> it's the String object
[17:09:23] <seltar> "a"
[17:09:49] <seltar> so, simplified you could do this: $.each(["a","b","c"], function(i){ console.log(i, this); });
[17:12:18] <chovy> seltar: i find .each() a convenience method to 'for'
[17:13:21] <seltar> it's absolutely a nice thing, but they each have their usecases imo
[17:14:31] <seltar> $.map is a nice one as well
[17:21:35] <acidjazz> hwos .map work
[17:22:21] <yedimind> ...?
[17:25:14] <Zo_> ?
[17:31:25] <Blaster> Hey guys im trying to simply animate the height of a div shrinking over 1.5 seconds but this code doesn't seem to be working.. $('.myDiv').animate({height:20px},1500)
[17:33:21] <Anime> "20px"
[17:34:01] <Blaster> nice
[17:34:02] <Blaster> thnaks
[17:34:17] <Anime> :)
[17:36:01] <Blaster> thats so fun!
[17:36:09] <Blaster> in the console the first time ever doing it
[17:36:33] <Blaster> why does the 20px need to be in quotes but not the height?
[17:36:46] <Blaster> is it due to mixing int and string?
[17:37:00] <Anime> property: value
[17:37:18] <Anime> if value is an int it doesn't need to be enclosed in quotes
[17:37:59] <Anime> {} so you can do multiple ones like {p1: v1, p2: v2, ...}
[17:38:53] <Blaster> ok
[17:44:31] <Whirl3d> I would like to write a function that returns a jquery object if passed  any of the following:  A valid selector string, a classname (without the '.'), an id value (without the "#"). So it would first check to see if it was a valid selector string, then try the class selector, then the id and return null if none found.
[17:45:52] <Whirl3d> but, I also want to be able to pass a string with "," separated tokens where each token is evaluated like above...I thought I had it, but jsfiddle locked up with too much recursion...
[17:53:40] <seltar> Whirl3d: a selector is valid with "," in it
[17:53:54] <seltar> so, if you need to pass in several, i'd recommend an array
[17:54:15] <seltar> myfunc(["div.mydiv > p", "myclass", "myid"]);
[17:54:33] <Whirl3d> seltar, I just realized that that adds a level of complexity. Otherwise I would just use $(str, "."+str, "#"+str).first();
[17:54:36] <seltar> and then run return $.each on them
[17:55:22] <Whirl3d> but if the str value was a valid selector with , in it, the .first() selector would mess up
[17:55:58] <seltar> i don't know what you are trying to do with this function, so i can't really answer that
[17:56:18] <seltar> or rather, why you aren't just passing in the extra . or # to make it a selector
[17:56:30] <Whirl3d> but wait! What if I just worked on the str value instead of making the jquery engine  do it
[17:56:43] <seltar> that is a better way
[17:57:07] <Whirl3d> I was doing $(str, ","+str,"#"+str).first() and it worked pretty well until the comma issue showed up
[17:57:38] <seltar> if(typeof str == "string" && str.length > 0 && str[0] != "." && str[0] != "#"){ // has to be selector }
[17:58:00] <seltar> or, no.. hehe, that was a bit of mix and match..
[17:58:31] <Whirl3d> the only problem is that I have to know all valid dom element names to check first
[17:58:49] <Whirl3d> because "body" or "p" would be valid selectors
[17:58:56] <seltar> $("p").length > 0
[18:00:09] <Whirl3d> I guess this is an example of when it is better to rely on your programmers to call the function correctly than it is to try to handle every possible input.
[18:02:24] <seltar> yup
[18:04:23] <Whirl3d> well, I am writing an image loading plugin and I want to use the syntax $(elem).loadImage(settings().... or $.loadImage(img, settings)....it's coming along great with two exceptions
[18:04:59] <Whirl3d> I want the $.fn.loadImage.defaults={every:handlerfunc, all:handlerfunc}
[18:05:53] <Whirl3d> so that if more than one image was requested to be loaded the "settings.all" handler would fire.
[18:08:14] <Whirl3d> simple enough, right? But in calling the $.loadImage method, you could pass a single handler--which should extend the default settings.every...still easy...but if you pass an object with an every handler and an all hanler, and I use $.extend(true, {}, $.loadImage.defaults, settings), won't it return all of the settings in the passed parameter?
[18:09:48] <Whirl3d> so, it might be a problem if someone tried $(".img").loadImage({all:allHandler, every:everyHandler, foo:bar}) because there is no foo:bar setting for the $.fn.loadImage method
[18:16:11] <Whirl3d> last post, sorry: I think I figured out a way to handle it: settings=$.extend({}, $.fn.loadImage.defaults,(settings instanceof Function)?{every:settings}:{},(settings.every)?{every:settings.every}:{},(settings.all)?{{all:settings.all}:{});
[18:16:31] <Whirl3d> u*g*l*y, but works
[18:17:42] <Whirl3d> seltar, thanks for the advice....
[19:02:41] <linkdump> Please, I'm new in JS and jQuery, I have a simple question.. I'm using this:   jQuery.getJSON('http://localhost/get_data/', { id : id }, function(data)   and this return to me: http://localhost/get_data/?id=1   but, how I can get "http://localhost/get_data/1"   instead   "/?id=1" ???
[19:03:44] <seltar>  Â jQuery.getJSON('http://localhost/get_data/'+id, {}, function(data)
[19:03:48] <seltar> or something
[19:04:41] <linkdump> seltar: thank you.. works.. ;)
[19:10:10] <te-brian> I am trying to use $.on() to delegate a custom event that I am manually triggering.  $.trigger() does not seem to be bubbling the event up such that delegation works.  Is this expected or am I just doing it wrong?
[19:16:42] <te-brian> well, nvm I guess... jsfiddle proved me wrong.. hmmm.... http://jsfiddle.net/xCPUr/
[19:24:15] <Fredflinston> Hello! I was wondering how you would create an event when you close a Jquery mobile dialog box. I am pulling my hair out.
[19:25:30] <Fredflinston> I can't find any info on the internet
[19:27:01] <Fredflinston> Anyone know?
[19:31:14] <timwis> oi
[20:09:21] <trewq> Hi Folks, I have an iframe on a page, and I am trying to replace the content inside the iframe (i.e. I am not changing the src attribute of the iframe). replaceWith() does not work - any thoughts?
[20:10:07] <trewq> and I am new to js and jquery
[20:14:18] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks!
[20:14:29] <dr0id> lol
[20:14:56] <jonathancutrell> Any designers in the house got a moment to take an objective look at some logos? (Unrelated to jQuery, but I'm here to help as well)
[20:29:19] <Whirl3d> <--i'll look so long as you aren't thin skinned
[20:34:08] <Blaster> hey when you see a function definition like jQuery(selector).animate( properties, [ duration ], [ easing ], [ callback ] )   are the arguments that are in brackets optional?  Also, do you need to have duration in order to have easing, and have easing in order to have callback?
[20:42:04] <coldhead> Blaster: [] usually means optional
[20:42:15] <coldhead> and you can sometimes get away with skipping arguments
[20:42:18] <letterpress> Blaster the args in brackets are optional. no, you can have a callback without duration or easing.
[20:42:28] <coldhead> if they have different types the code MAY be able to work out what's what by type
[20:43:12] <coldhead> "ah, i've got a function for duration, this must be the callback"
[20:43:23] <coldhead> but there's no guarantee they'll do that
[20:43:23] <Blaster> i see
[20:43:35] <coldhead> so when in doubt it's better to pass nulls
[20:43:41] <coldhead> and match the expected signature
[20:43:46] <Blaster> have you used the easing plugin?
[20:43:52] <coldhead> yes
[20:44:18] <Blaster> i noticed there's one called compatibility and it says "use this if you dont want to have to change your easing type names"  do you know what it means by that?
[20:44:39] <coldhead> there is a newer easing lib at https://github.com/danheberden/easing.js
[20:44:56] <coldhead> Blaster: the easing lib changed its names a few years ago
[20:45:10] <coldhead> if you have old code using the old names you can use the compat mode
[20:45:15] <coldhead> if it's new code then just forget it
[20:46:16] <pneftali> hi guys - is there a jquery animation that allows a page to slide-left/right to another page ?
[20:47:12] <pneftali> there;s slideUp and slideDown, but no slideLeft/slideRight ?
[20:47:22] <ruby_on_tails> pneftali: you can align the pages one after another and animation the scoll/margin/positioning to achieve that effect
[20:47:32] <trewq> hi folks - just created a SO question.. would appreciate any advice http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9652521/replace-iframe-content
[20:47:49] <ruby_on_tails> pneftali: animate left/right of an absolutely positioned element for that effect, slideleft/right isnt available
[20:47:53] <ruby_on_tails> hi coldsy
[20:48:40] <pneftali> ruby_on_tails: alright, thought there's an out-of-the-box solution for that. thanks for the info.
[20:49:22] <ruby_on_tails> pneftali: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/02/slide-elements-in-different-directions
[20:49:48] <coldhead> hi rubsy
[20:50:32] <coldhead> pneftali: you can animate almost anything you want, it's worth learning how to use ?animate // and then you can make your crazy dreams a delicious reality
[20:50:32] <bot-t> pneftali, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[20:51:31] <ruby_on_tails> so animate // will invoke the bot
[20:51:48] <ruby_on_tails> oh its ?animate to invoke the bot
[20:51:54] <ruby_on_tails> umm its ?animate // ?
[20:51:58] <ruby_on_tails> bleh
[20:52:14] <coldhead> use ?toggleclass
[20:52:14] <bot-t> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[20:52:57] <coldhead> also try ?browser
[20:53:05] <coldhead> i was sure try ?worked
[20:53:07] <coldhead> oh well
[21:07:40] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: i made a new website, wanna have a look ?
[21:11:54] <coldhead> lemme see, ruby_on_tails
[21:12:07] <ruby_on_tails> http://thecodeplayer.com
[21:12:56] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: feedback would be appreciated
[21:13:22] <coldhead> verryy handsome
[21:14:38] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: thanks
[21:16:11] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: any ideas for improvement ?
[21:17:23] <coldhead> really none that i can think of!
[21:17:32] <coldhead> and i'm trying to be critical
[21:17:37] <coldhead> it looks and works nicely
[21:17:44] <ruby_on_tails> ha
[21:17:46] <coldhead> and you have some really cool content that i haven't seen elsewhere
[21:18:03] <coldhead> the crazy css transitions are melting my cpu
[21:18:08] <coldhead> but that's hardly your fault
[21:18:15] <coldhead> did you design this?
[21:18:21] <coldhead> the colours and layout are good
[21:18:28] <ruby_on_tails> no the items are from other authors
[21:18:32] <ruby_on_tails> i designed the website
[21:18:40] <ruby_on_tails> the clouds, iconfont is mine
[21:18:41] <coldhead> the website is the design i am admiring
[21:18:53] <ruby_on_tails> yea i designed it
[21:24:16] <gataraid> I like it too ruby
[21:24:20] <gataraid> I'm a nobody
[21:24:31] <gataraid> But it looks very awesome
[21:24:40] <ruby_on_tails> gataraid: thanks
[21:28:46] <blendedbychris> hey guys
[21:29:05] <blendedbychris> i'm looking at ways to track external links via google analytics and i found this code
[21:29:10] <blendedbychris> $('a:external').click(function(){   _gaq.push(['_trackEvent','Outbound','Link',$(this).attr('href')]); });
[21:29:25] <blendedbychris> do i have to add an attribute to the a tag of "external" ?
[21:29:40] <pneftali> ruby_on_tails: nice useful link. i revised some parts to suit my need. thanks :)
[21:29:58] <ruby_on_tails> pneftali: great
[21:30:31] <blendedbychris> or rel="external" ?
[21:32:36] <legfrogstew> Hi everyone. I'm trying to get this to work: http://pastie.org/3568691. It's trying to validate a datetime entry, I'm trying to use the jQuery Validation plugin and datejs
[21:33:12] <legfrogstew> I'm really stuck and can't get the thing to validate a date that is of format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, and compare whether one is greater than the other
[21:35:22] <ei2matrix> Hi, question, I have a div that I show to info that a event was succesfully executed, but I want to show it at the middle of my screen, actually I show it centered but just if I am positioned at top of page, but if I scroled down it stay there.
[21:35:35] <blendedbychris> a:external ? is that a legit selector?
[21:36:09] <ruby_on_tails> if anyone is interested to be an alpha tester on thecodeplayer.com that would be great
[21:36:54] <denom> I'm looking at a jqXHR returned by backbone, I'm trying to figure out why the `status()` never changes?  I can see the request in my debugger return with a 200 OK, but the XHR status remains pending..
[21:47:09] <denom> s/status/state/
[21:50:27] <denom> Well It looks like the XHR is expecting a body in return message. If I return even a blank space in the response, the call to `state()` returns a 'resolved' string
[22:07:11] <Blaster> hey guys how come this would throw an error with the easing plugin? $('.myDiv').slideDown({duration:1000,easing:'slideOutBounce'});
[22:09:44] <atxq> when I load html using $.post I get issues with jquery code not working, but if I load the html directly into the page the jquery code runs properly?
[22:10:40] <atxq> this usually happend to jquery code that affects textareas
[22:10:42] <svcghost> Does anyone know well how YouTube works? How can I diagnose "An error occurred. Please try again later." issues?
[22:13:43] <pneftali> how do you plugin the value &larr; into an anchor tag ? tried someanchor.text('&larr;') but not working
[22:14:40] <atxq> did you try .html('&larr;') ?
[22:15:32] <pneftali> atxq: that;s it! thanks :)
[22:20:32] <atxq> so does anyone know why jquery code does not run properly on html inserted using ajax $.post?
[22:20:59] <gyaresu> JQM annoyance. Is there supposed to be a separate div inside "content" div when using Google Maps? http://jsfiddle.net/gyaresu/zDVKn/
[22:21:54] <gyaresu> atxq: Code examples help.
[22:28:07] <atxq> when I insert html using .html(""), jquery code does not work properly, especially when the html is fetched using $.post
[22:28:25] <atxq> only works when I insert it directly into the page
[22:29:32] <atxq> ex. $("textarea").keydown(...$(this).css("background-color","red")...etc.
[22:30:28] <atxq> if the textarea is not deteched when page loads, its like it gets ignored, so when inserting textarea using $.post, jquery code does not run on the textarea
[22:31:52] <letterpress> atxq you're saying that the events that you bound at page load don't work on elements you subsequently added to the page?
[22:32:10] <atxq> correct
[22:32:22] <atxq> or so this has been my experience so far
[22:32:51] <letterpress> well these elements weren't there to be bound. so you're right, that's how bind() (which keydown() is shorthand for) works.
[22:33:05] <letterpress> so you have two choicesâ€¦rebind after you insert the new html
[22:33:07] <atxq> makes sense
[22:33:32] <atxq> so key down and bind("keydown... two different things
[22:33:40] <atxq> ?
[22:33:47] <letterpress> or better yet use .on(), which will bind the events to a parent element. the container that you insert the html into, that will be present both at page load and when you insert something inside it.
[22:34:32] <letterpress> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:34:51] <atxq> so $("textarea")... should only work properly on the textares on the page that exist when page is loaded?
[22:35:18] <atxq> any additional textareas inserted afterwards get ignored?
[22:35:28] <letterpress> the syntax is like $(".container").on("textarea","keydown",function(){});
[22:36:29] <letterpress> from the .keydown() page: This method is a shortcut for .bind('keydown', handler) in the first and second variations, and .trigger('keydown') in the third.
[22:37:50] <atxq> I want to execute a piece of code on all textareas on a page, including those load directly, or thoses added later on. what shoudl be the proper way to do this?
[22:38:07] <letterpress> definitely .on()
[22:38:58] <letterpress> so you've got to figure out a root element for the .on() method. this would be a parent element that's common to all textareas, hopefully
[22:40:59] <letterpress> but just to clarify, you want your code to fire on keydown, right?
[22:41:13] <letterpress> ^ that's how my example would work above
[22:42:37] <atxq> yes
[22:43:14] <atxq> every time I press tab key in textarea, I want to insert tab in any textarea on the page
[22:43:58] <atxq> using .keydown only inserts tabs if the textarea exists when the page was loaded
[22:44:28] <atxq> those inserted afterwars .html() get no tab
[22:44:32] <Blaster> How come the each argument is capitalized on http://api.jquery.com/each/?
[22:44:55] <atxq> .on should fix this issue then, right?
[22:46:49] <Blaster> Element argument*
[22:49:28] <atxq> .on does not resolve the issue that I am having here
[22:55:41] <atxq> any suggests on how to affect all textareas within a page, no matter when they get loaded?
[22:59:32] <panda> hi guys
[23:00:13] <Guest30405> hi can anyone help me out
[23:00:24] <Guest30405> I am trying to do an ajax call inside a delegate
[23:00:54] <Guest30405> anyone?
[23:04:00] <Guest30405> hello
[23:04:03] <Guest30405> anyone there?
[23:04:12] <Guest30405> -help
[23:04:14] <Guest30405> help
[23:04:17] <atxq> delegate?
[23:04:24] <Guest30405> yes
[23:04:38] <Guest30405> $("#results").delegate("li", "click", function(){
[23:04:44] <Guest30405> Im trying to put ajax inside that
[23:05:22] <atxq> ajax inside that jquery code?
[23:05:33] <Guest30405> yes
[23:06:10] <systemfault> You just have to press the letters on the keyboard between the left and right curly braces.
[23:09:06] <Guest30405> is that possible
[23:09:27] <systemfault> Guest30405: Seriously.. do you have a real question? :/
[23:09:37] <Guest30405> because i get errors when I do an ajax call within it, however if I do the ajax call outside like on document ready then it works
[23:10:03] <systemfault> It should work just fine.. you're doing something wrong.
[23:10:07] <Blaster> how can you use continue to go to the next iteration inside a $(element).each() ?
[23:10:34] <systemfault> Blaster: I guess you could just "return"?
[23:10:47] <Blaster> ok
[23:11:40] <Guest30405> i think i should specify, sorry
[23:12:01] <Guest30405> I am actually calling the delegate after an ajax call to populate my #results
[23:12:40] <Guest30405> so the flow is that user enters query, hits search and gets a list of items, once user clicks on item, do something (which is the ajax call im stuck at)
[23:14:15] <systemfault> Ok then you just add a delegate to your "result container" for the items.. and you do the ajax call in the handler.
[23:14:21] <systemfault> It should work
[23:14:42] <systemfault> You probably have done something wrong because your "reasoning" seems right.
[23:16:25] <Guest30405> ok  thanks
[23:18:55] <atxq> what is the differnce between delegate and on?
[23:19:26] <systemfault> atxq: on is pretty much the merge of "bind" and "delegate"
[23:19:46] <systemfault> You can now use on for any event handling
[23:19:52] <_zoggy_> ?jquery on

[23:21:05] <_zoggy_> hmm whatever i forget whats the syntax
[23:21:10] <Blaster> if you're iterating over form elements, is it quicker to do hasClass + removeClass, or just removeClass?
[23:21:17] <_zoggy_> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:21:22] <_zoggy_> anyways, go look it up
[23:21:32] <systemfault> atxq: You can "forget" about bind/delegate/live and just use .on
[23:21:36] <_zoggy_> just use remove.. if thats what you want it to do
[23:21:39] <_zoggy_> who cares if it has it or not
[23:21:42] <_zoggy_> why waste the check
[23:22:38] <Blaster> I was wondering if maybe the check takes less time than remove when the class isn't there
[23:24:00] <Guest30405> ok so i did the delegate inside my onSuccess of the first ajax call is that allowed or should I do it outside?
[23:24:35] <systemfault> Guest30405: It doesn't make sense to me... you should bind the delegate "onready"
[23:25:06] <Guest30405> so #results onready?
[23:28:47] <Guest30405> thanks, I think I am moving closer to a solution
[23:39:37] <Guest30405> can i use bind instead of delegate?
[23:43:13] <Guest30405> nvm that failed horribly
