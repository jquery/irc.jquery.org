[00:18:46] <Zisha> Got an issue, cannot figure out why it's not working.  I've got a bunch of divs in a vertical line, I want the 2nd one to push up over the top of the first one, the first one to disappear, and be moved to the bottom.  I've tried to do slideUp, but as soon as the div touches the one above, it snaps upward, rather than smoothly animating all the way on top.  Any ideas?
[00:18:56] <encompass> devaholic: mine page current just loads the page with a good ol iframe.
[00:19:16] <encompass> devaholic: but that has no checks if the page it's working.
[00:19:49] <devaholic> Zisha: use jsfiddle
[00:20:07] <tp43> I have a major problem!  ok, so I have a for loop, for (var i =1; i < 99; i++) {} and inside the loop, I set up some input element, <input ...value='"+i+"'.../>, problem is instead of having 99 input element with values, 1, 2, 3...98, I get 99 input element with value=98
[00:20:21] <devaholic> encompass: when/how does the iframe load? can you just ajax the content
[00:21:57] <tp43> so I guess, using append, the entire for loop get cycled through, before the input elements are posted, so they all get the value of the last loop, being 98, is there a way, to have each append happen after each loop so it appends 99 times instead of just once?
[00:22:06] <encompass> devaholic: sadly if I do that it's javascript steps all over my page. Hence the iframe
[00:22:48] <Zisha> devaholic: paste the saved address?
[00:24:31] <devaholic> encompass: you can set the .location of that iframe to load it programmatically with javascript, but im not sure about catching error response codes
[00:24:48] <devaholic> that might get you in the right direction though..
[00:25:06] <Zisha> http://jsfiddle.net/RWPyW/2/
[00:25:08] <devaholic> Zisha: paste whatever you have... i dont think anyone can help you unless you share the code with that one
[00:25:25] <Zisha> it does it on jsfiddle to so it's not just my page.
[00:26:17] <Zisha> You can see what it's trying to do, but...yeah.  hits the top and pops, rather than sliding all the way offscreen.
[00:27:38] <amh345> does window.load go inside or outside of document.ready?
[00:28:48] <coldhead> you can put it inside, amh345, because .ready will fire first
[00:28:58] <coldhead> but one can only wonder at what you're doing
[00:29:28] <amh345> :( im trying to pass something to an swf. and apparently im having issues because it's not loaded.
[00:30:09] <coldhead> amh345: can you maybe use the excellent swfobject plugin?
[00:30:11] <amh345> so people are saying to use  window.onload = function() {////}. but the thing is i need it to trigger on a .click
[00:30:19] <coldhead> and set everything up inside your jqueries?
[00:30:32] <amh345> im using something called jquery swf plugin. but ive hit a snag. so im looking for another route
[00:31:08] <coldhead> window.onload is so what flash devs would recommend
[00:31:08] <amh345> what is this excellent swfobject plugin you speak of?
[00:31:24] <amh345> im so fried from this. ive been looking under every rock for an answer.
[00:31:33] <amh345> like hours and hours now.
[00:31:33] <coldhead> http://jquery.thewikies.com/swfobject/
[00:31:43] <amh345> that's the one im using coldhead :(
[00:31:43] <coldhead> that is the best way to mix jQuery and SWF
[00:31:50] <coldhead> it also has an excellent theme song
[00:31:54] <amh345> heh
[00:31:56] <coldhead> maybe you need to listen to the song more
[00:32:05] <amh345> are you familiar with that plugin?
[00:32:25] <encompass> devaholic:  thanks
[00:32:27] <coldhead> i haven't had to use it in a few years
[00:32:28] <coldhead> but i have
[00:32:39] <coldhead> the author is one of the best people in the whole world
[00:32:39] <amh345> it's been working beautifully-- until i try and trigger something in the swf with it. then it's a no go
[00:32:52] <amh345> i emailed the author.  havent heard back yet.
[00:33:20] <coldhead> oh man, talking TO swf from JS is hard
[00:33:34] <coldhead> i don't know of any plugin that can help with that, sorry
[00:33:53] <amh345> oh
[00:34:25] <amh345> he's got these examples on his site. but they arent working. plus he doesnt show the actionscript side.
[00:34:39] <amh345> err. they arent working for me
[00:35:36] <Zisha> Any ideas on how to fix the slideUp bug I'm running into?
[00:37:26] <coldhead> amh345: the author JonathanNeal is in california
[00:37:31] <{-_-\\\> hi
[00:37:32] <coldhead> he's online a lot if you can catch him
[00:37:36] <{-_-\\\> i load some stuff via ajax
[00:37:37] <coldhead> ?time california
[00:37:38] <bot-t> coldhead, california - Time: 12:37am Tuesday (PDT), Weather: Clear, 15°C / 59°F
[00:37:41] <{-_-\\\> this stuff has css link inside
[00:37:47] <coldhead> give him 8 hours >: |
[00:37:55] <{-_-\\\> the problem is - it displays unstyled, then styles are applied as css is read
[00:38:07] <{-_-\\\> how can i delay its showing until all css/js are loaded?
[00:38:58] <amh345> coldhead: in respect to what i was mentioning earlier.   if im suppose to use .load.   how can i use that in conjunction with a .click?  the idea is that i need to make sure something is loaded before i can trigger it with .click.
[00:39:38] <coldhead> $('#swfthing').load(function () {$(this).click();}) is the first thing that comes to mind
[00:40:27] <amh345> ok, but the #click is going to be triggered by an html href
[00:40:33] <amh345> err .click
[00:40:34] <coldhead> {-_-\\\: at the start of the content you load via ajax, put <style>#somediv {display:none}</style> and then in your css put #somediv {display:block}
[00:40:57] <coldhead> where #somediv is some appropriate container
[00:41:26] <{-_-\\\> hmm, nice idea
[00:41:30] <{-_-\\\> i will try in the evening
[00:41:46] <impi> if i have multiple inputs with the same class, how can i get the value of the one i just edited? is there a quick way?
[00:42:26] <impi> like  onchange="this.value" ?
[00:45:19] <encompass> devaholic: I suppose I could try to load the image twice... one with an ajavax call and check the error and other other with the iframe if successful.
[00:46:38] <coldhead> amh345: man maybe you need to look into deferreds
[00:46:56] <coldhead> so your click can file a request to have some code execute once the swf is loaded
[00:47:16] <coldhead> i don't know much about that stuff but it sounds like the kind of thing it's meant for
[00:49:40] <amh345> this is what im trying now http://jsfiddle.net/9DA3f/   but my loaded alert doesnt trigger.
[00:50:00] <amh345> if i change it to (window).load.. it triggers.
[00:50:02] <amh345> heh
[00:51:11] <amh345> i mean this.  type on the id name http://jsfiddle.net/9DA3f/1/
[01:04:55] <greedo> so, I'm trying to .get a page
[01:05:16] <greedo> how does same origin policy effect this
[01:06:21] <NodeX> err can you elaborate
[01:06:55] <greedo> I'm trying to get a page from some random url on the web
[01:07:02] <NodeX> not possible
[01:07:12] <NodeX> unless you proxy with your webserver
[01:07:36] <greedo> so, I can only request page on the server?
[01:07:52] <NodeX> same server, same port, same scheme (check that though)
[01:08:00] <greedo> dang
[01:08:12] <NodeX> unless you proxy it of course
[01:11:08] <tp43> Anyone have some time?  Why doesn't this show the input elements? http://jsfiddle.net/AZ7VV/
[01:13:02] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/AZ7VV/2/
[01:13:05] <NodeX> :)
[01:13:35] <tp43> NodeX, thanks
[01:13:40] <NodeX> nps
[01:13:56] <NodeX> div#pend is slower than #pend
[01:14:06] <NodeX> just an fyi
[01:14:26] <Clorith> I'm trying to find the most sensible way to check if a <li> object has a child <ul> (to look for submenus), is there some easy way of doing this?
[01:15:15] <NodeX> $(this).find('ul').size() ?
[01:15:26] <NodeX> this being the li
[01:15:46] <Clorith> well, that was easy, haha
[01:16:41] <NodeX> there may be a more efficient way but I need some context
[01:17:43] <Clorith> There really isn't more context then that, I considered doing it by classes but I foudn that to be unreliable due to various circumstances since the same classes do end up being used for non-parent elements and such
[01:18:07] <Clorith> This way seem sto work perfectly, the chlid menus are never more the n2-3 objects so it won't be slow either, so this works like a charm
[01:18:10] <Clorith> Thank you
[01:18:16] <NodeX> yw :P
[01:18:18] <NodeX> ;) *
[01:19:57] <Zisha> http://jsfiddle.net/RWPyW/3/    Can anyone help me figure out why this doesn't push the element all the way offso the next div takes its place?
[01:20:30] <NodeX> err for a start divs are not allowed in UL's lol
[01:20:55] <Zisha> eh, it was a leftover.  Removing them makes no difference.
[01:21:15] <NodeX> I didn't say it would but they are still not allowed
[01:21:39] <Zisha> well, I'm not working on 'allowed' or not, I'm working on trying to get it to animate properly.
[01:23:07] <NodeX> that's nice, good luck with that
[01:25:07] <Symbi0nt> Zisha: this looks like a script fond on many many website. Just go there and grab the code. Don't reinvent the wheel.
[01:25:30] <Symbi0nt> like a products list
[01:25:38] <Symbi0nt> or add rotator
[01:25:42] <Zisha> Well, I can't seem to find such code on any sites I know of.
[01:42:03] <blazento> hi. does this make sense to anyone here? This easing attribute runs a function with misc variables... how would i make the duration of the animation longer? https://gist.github.com/1330164
[01:43:01] <SaadIbrahim> I need an expert for a project
[01:43:10] <SaadIbrahim> its a slightly complicate slider
[01:43:33] <xec> blazento: i'm guessing duration is not part of the easing, but a separate option for the animation
[01:44:15] <blazento> xec, what's the point of that easing attribute?
[01:45:15] <xec> if you want something to start slow, speed up and then decelerate at the end, for instance
[01:45:36] <xec> http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/easing.html
[01:46:20] <xec> all these can have different durations
[01:46:22] <Deele> good day fellow querists'
[01:46:56] <Kagetsuki> hello
[01:48:24] <Kagetsuki> I have a question reguarding keyboard events - I'm not getting any event when using an IME
[01:48:42] <Kagetsuki> does anybody know how to detect key events using an IME?
[01:49:40] <Kagetsuki> and yes I'm aware different browsers send different key events - I'm hoping jQuery homogonizes that into something
[01:50:30] <blazento> ah thanks xec
[01:52:41] <Douglish> Hello all, I have an issue with jQuery, maybe it's expected behaviour, in that case I need to do some workaround. I have a button in a form and I attach an click event, first click works great, but when I click once more, the handler is not triggered. Is that like the handler runs only once?
[01:53:33] <Kagetsuki> Douglish: is the code the click event running causing any errors?
[01:54:07] <Kagetsuki> if there's a runtime error the script may just stop there and future events won't fire
[01:54:41] <Douglish> Kagetsuki: There us not, but I'm returning false to avoid sending.
[01:56:36] <Kagetsuki> what happens if the button is something else?
[01:56:41] <Kagetsuki> as in not a button
[01:57:30] <Kagetsuki> by button I'm assuming you mean a form button (that's probably sending a POST) and not a jQuery UI button (which is a cosmetically modified link)
[01:58:01] <NodeX> ?siblings
[01:58:02] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[01:58:05] <NodeX> ?next
[01:58:06] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[01:58:56] <Douglish> Kagetsuki: it's <button>, maybe I can use the ui button
[01:59:30] <Kagetsuki> Douglish: if you are already using jQuery UI then I wouldn't use a <button>
[01:59:51] <Kagetsuki> in general form elements cause headaches when you try to not use them as form elements
[02:00:16] <Kagetsuki> and if you are using jQuery UI you get the added benefit of the buttons not looking like generic crap
[02:01:13] <SaadIbrahim> anyone here interested in a quick freelance project?
[02:01:46] <Kagetsuki> Saadlbrahim: depends
[02:01:57] <Kagetsuki> can you give me some more details?
[02:02:21] <iavana> SaadIbrahim : more details
[02:02:54] <SaadIbrahim> I will pm you

[02:03:26] <Jeroenem> I'm stuck on just a little piece of code, can someone help me out pls? http://jsfiddle.net/mCrn5/1/
[02:03:50] <Jeroenem> it should open the link in a new window while clicking on the entire DIV
[02:06:05] <NodeX> Jeroenem : http://jsfiddle.net/mCrn5/4/
[02:06:29] <NodeX> Or that .. http://jsfiddle.net/mCrn5/5/
[02:09:15] <micha--> hi, what plugin do you recommend for form input validation? the description for jQuery.html5form looks nice to me, but I am a newbie in this...
[02:11:00] <intellilogic> I want to be able to drag and drop between options between select elements, how can I do this?  JQuery UI doesn
[02:11:12] <intellilogic> 't seem to be working $("#PDB_IN option").draggable
[02:11:18] <Jeroenem> NodeX thanks! but whats the var h doing exactly? i dont get the point lol
[02:11:25] <NodeX> h is the href
[02:11:53] <NodeX> intellilogic : <option> is not a block level element and is not used in markup
[02:11:56] <Jeroenem> ok i see :) and why the double (h,h) on window.open?
[02:11:59] <NodeX> so it will never happen
[02:12:22] <NodeX> Jeroenem: because it requires a name
[02:12:31] <NodeX> google "window.open"
[02:12:45] <Jeroenem> yes i will look further into it :) thanks
[02:13:08] <intellilogic> NodeX: how to do this then?  Should I use a different HTML element?  I just want to be able to drag items around from listbox to listbox.
[02:13:24] <NodeX> I dont know what a listbox is
[02:14:01] <NodeX> if you mean a <select> element then one approach would be to clone an element in it's position and drag thaty
[02:15:32] <intellilogic> NodeX:  I was trying to be more generic to know what other options to using a select element I might have.  Can anyone link me some sort of example of dragging the option elements of a select?  I'm not sure where to begin.  Clone it?
[02:16:18] <NodeX> you would be better off writing a plugin to transform a select element into an UL>li list or somehting
[02:16:30] <NodeX> then you can drag to your hearts content
[02:18:24] <intellilogic> I could just style a UL and then call it a day, huh?
[02:18:35] <NodeX> ^^ that's what I just said :)
[02:18:41] <NodeX> it would be the easiest
[02:19:11] <intellilogic> Yes, that's what you said, I was sorta rephrasing to confirm I understood :)
[02:50:16] <NodeX> ?last
[02:50:16] <bot-t> .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/

[03:14:33] <impi> i have tried that, then i get undefined
[03:15:02] <tomp> have you got any code anywhere?
[03:15:05] <NodeX> ?demo @ impi
[03:15:06] <bot-t> impi, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:21:21] <Aamir> tomp & impi  its .val() also if you are using jQuery UI date picker than look for onSelect method
[03:42:22] <vladyn> morning
[03:53:33] <impi> i put up this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/UMy9D/10/
[03:54:01] <impi> it's not the cleanest, as i am still busy working with it, but it runs - can anyone tell me how i can get the value of the date which i have just selected?
[03:54:48] <impi> i was thinking that i could get hold of it like jquery calendar like function (dateText, inst) but it doesnt seem that datebox has such a thing..

[04:53:23] <nVee> hey guys. This is probably more a javascript logic question, but how do I give a variable global scope when declared within a $.post() jquery function?
[04:53:36] <Onions> set it outside the scope
[04:53:43] <Onions> then do variable = newval
[04:56:13] <64MAA0DAF> is .attr() able to take a json-object?
[04:56:53] <Onions> only one way to find out :p
[04:58:26] <Xotix> Why would something like this happen? http://screencast.com/t/HeLyBSebK8w i'm dragging a table into a table. im not adding tr and td's yet (don't know why). it's chrome on mac. how can i fix this?
[05:00:19] <TimothyA> anyone here knows why a table will not be 100% even if you set it, after hiding/displaying it?
[05:01:18] <TimothyA> anyone at all?
[05:01:44] <Onions> I don't get what you mean
[05:01:56] <TimothyA> like, let's say I have a table. its width is 100%
[05:02:06] <TimothyA> I make it disappear for a second, and reappear... and it's not 100% width anymore
[05:02:19] <TimothyA> it's as if that style property doesn't exist anymore (I checked, it's still defined)
[05:02:24] <Onions> Code?
[05:02:43] <TimothyA> $('table').css('display', 'none').css('display', 'block');
[05:03:10] <e6nian> what does jQuery16406038861880078912 mean ?
[05:03:23] <Onions> display: block means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have always been. A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements next to it, except when ordered otherwise (by adding a float declaration to another element, for instance).
[05:03:36] <TimothyA> gah
[05:03:58] <Onions> TimothyA
[05:04:03] <Onions> display's default value is inline
[05:04:43] <TimothyA> nope, still getting the same :/
[05:04:52] <TimothyA> wasn't it table-something ?
[05:05:09] <Onions> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp
[05:05:10] <64MAA0DAF> TimothyA: inline-table
[05:05:23] <TimothyA> display:table
[05:05:32] <Onions> TimothyA
[05:05:43] <Onions> var x = $('table').css('display');
[05:05:46] <Onions> console.log(x);
[05:06:00] <Onions> $('table').css('display','none').display('display',x);
[05:06:06] <TimothyA> hmm... nope. display:table and display:inline-table are still returning the same as display:block
[05:06:38] <Onions> what does it log?
[05:06:41] <TimothyA> table
[05:06:48] <Onions> weird
[05:06:56] <Onions> the code i pasted, that doesnt revert it to what it was?
[05:07:04] <TimothyA> yes, it does
[05:07:04] <Onions> it should o.0
[05:07:14] <Onions> isnt that what you wanted?
[05:07:15] <Onions> lol
[05:07:32] <TimothyA> ah, got it. it was setting an another element as table as well
[05:07:36] <TimothyA> I really need my coffee

[05:19:35] <nVee> hey Onions, thank you for the info. I set the variable outside of the $.post(), then changed the value within the function in an if statement, but it does not take the new variable value
[05:19:39] <nVee> it remains empty
[05:19:41] <cafaro> Is it possible to change "this" to a different element when passed to a callback function?
[05:20:04] <Onions> code?
[05:21:25] <nVee> Onions: http://pastebin.com/cuVJ5x8F
[05:22:22] <Onions> use some logging
[05:22:35] <Onions> console.log(data.userID + ' ' + uid);
[05:22:38] <Onions> under where it's set
[05:23:01] <Alan> damn... i found a good JSON-RPC library, but it's 2.0-only
[05:23:13] <nVee> when I move the alert within the $.post function, it actually takes the correct value
[05:23:26] <nVee> but outside of the $.post function it still uses the original value
[05:26:04] <Onions> so the uid sets ok?
[05:26:18] <Onions> weird.
[05:26:41] <Onions> Not sure, sorry nVee
[05:26:44] <Onions> it should work o.0
[05:26:47] <Onions> nVee
[05:26:56] <Onions> try declaring uid before everything ?
[05:27:08] <shesek> nVee, http://fixingthesejquery.com/images/ajax101.png
[05:27:36] <Onions> ohhhhhhhhhh
[05:27:39] <Onions> i got it
[05:27:39] <Onions> lol
[05:27:48] <Onions> ok nVee 1 sec
[05:27:58] <shesek> NOT, EVER, THERE :P
[05:28:07] <nVee> let me have a look
[05:28:39] <shesek> var data; $.get('/foo', function(d){data = d;}); alert(data);
[05:28:39] <Onions> nVee
[05:28:40] <Onions> http://pastebin.com/1NQJJPBY
[05:28:55] <Onions> should work
[05:29:24] <Onions> ironically i had this same problem yesterday
[05:29:24] <Onions> xD
[05:29:40] <shesek> The alert() doesn't wait for the AJAX call to finish (that what makes it asynchronous). If the AJAX call takes 10 seconds, it won't delay the alert() - so it doesn't make sense for it to work
[05:30:00] <shesek> you can only access that data from the callback, or from code that's executed after the AJAX response has finished and the callback was fired
[05:30:55] <shesek> You can think about that like var data; setTimeout(function(){data = 123;}, 1500); alert(data);
[05:31:20] <shesek> in both cases, "You can't access that data there."
[05:32:29] <shesek> Onions, `continue` is a reserved word, you can't use that as a function name
[05:32:55] <Onions> my bad.
[05:33:03] <Onions> i'm sure he can change the word lol
[05:33:05] <Onions> (or she)
[05:33:34] <nVee> haha
[05:33:36] <nVee> i can change it :)
[05:33:44] <shesek> and besides, you can just put the contents of `continue` directly in the AJAX callback, no need to separate it to a different function
[05:33:52] <nVee> we'll, shesek and Onions
[05:33:53] <Onions> !calc 441000*5
[05:33:54] <nVee> well*
[05:33:57] <Onions> bleh
[05:34:09] <Onions> >> 441000*5
[05:34:12] <Onions> aw
[05:34:35] <nVee> im slightly confused now :)
[05:34:49] <Onions> http://pastebin.com/1NQJJPBY
[05:34:51] <nVee> my function returns data.userID on success
[05:34:54] <Onions> change continue to continue_json
[05:35:08] <nVee> so there is no simple way of assigning that return value to a variable?
[05:35:15] <Onions> what do you mean?
[05:35:16] <Onions> o.0
[05:35:16] <nVee> to use through-out my script
[05:35:49] <shesek> nVee, it is assigned to that variable, but you're trying to access it before its assigned
[05:36:00] <shesek> have you read what I wrote?
[05:36:06] <shesek> <shesek> You can think about that like var data; setTimeout(function(){data = 123;}, 1500); alert(data);
[05:36:42] <Onions> var uid; $.post(blah blah, function (data) { uid = whatever; }).success(function () { contine_json(); }); function continue_json() { alert(uid); }
[05:37:08] <shesek> you can just .success(continue_json)
[05:37:25] <Onions> i wasnt sure on that one
[05:37:29] <shesek> or .success(function(){ alert(uid); })
[05:37:41] <shesek> or just put the code that uses the uid right after setting the uid, really
[05:37:45] <Onions> shesek, they're probably gonna do more stuff after
[05:37:45] <nVee> okay, so the .success function then indicates (hey, success, we have the data, lets work with it?
[05:38:01] <Onions> i like it in functions :P
[05:38:35] <shesek> nVee, the success function is the same as the function you're passing to $.post(), they're both called when the AJAX request is done
[05:40:24] <Onions> the success is immediately after the function (data) { right?
[05:41:15] <shesek> internally, jQuery uses the same mechanism for both - but yes, the callback passed directly to $.(ajax|get|post) is registered first
[05:41:26] <shesek> and called first, too
[05:41:51] <nVee> I feel like such a noob right now :P
[05:41:59] <nVee> correction, I must be a noob right now :)
[05:42:13] <nVee> let me read up about this
[05:42:18] <nVee> im missing this completely :)
[05:42:41] <Xotix> what's the jquery mailing list?
[05:43:09] <Onions> look for it on jquery.net probably
[05:43:12] <Onions> er
[05:43:12] <Onions> .com
[05:44:34] <Cork> ?g jquery mailing list
[05:44:34] <bot-t> Cork, Discussion - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://jquery.com/discuss/
[05:44:40] <pratz> hey guys i used this test = $('div#goods_container').find('.jobTbl_row2').find('.jobTbl_msgcel1').find('input') , it gives me all the input elements, but i need the values of the input element, how do i get that ?
[05:44:44] <HiDensity> helloâ€¦I have a div with a class "women's-healthcare" and I cannot seem to be able to select it because of the apostrophe
[05:45:04] <Cork> HiDensity: ' isn't valid class names
[05:45:31] <Cork> mainly cause ' is valid value capsuls in html
[05:45:32] <HiDensity> I've tried to escape the character by using: $("div.women\'s-healthcare")
[05:45:49] <Cork> no you miss the point, it isn't valid html
[05:45:54] <HiDensity> ok
[05:45:59] <Xotix> there it just says "use the mailing list" but not how the address is.
[05:46:09] <shesek> pratz, you know you can simply  $('div#goods_container .jobTbl_row2 .jobTbl_msgcel1 input'), right?
[05:46:45] <HiDensity> unfortunately the class is being generated by drupalâ€¦
[05:46:49] <Cork> Xotix: did you check the discussion page?
[05:47:09] <Cork> theres a long list of mailing lists there
[05:47:13] <HiDensity> thanks!
[05:48:43] <shesek> HiDensity, try double escaping it
[05:48:48] <shesek> $("div.women\\'s-healthcare")
[05:48:52] <shesek> I dunno if it'll work tho
[05:48:55] <shesek> you can also try
[05:49:11] <Xotix> where? i just find archives
[05:49:29] <shesek> $('div[class^=women][class$=s-healthcare])... a really stupid solution, but might work if Sizzle chokes on the single quote
[05:49:45] <shesek> (assuming the element doesn't have other classes)
[05:49:52] <Onions> xotix http://docs.jquery.com/Discussion
[05:50:11] <shesek> but really, you should try to get drupal to generate the class name without that
[05:50:30] <shesek> it looks like its coming from a slug definition, its probably changable via the admin panel
[05:51:21] <Xotix> Onions, there i just find the archives of google groups
[05:51:35] <DRSK> Someone able to help me figure out why the "tooltip"-box won't appear when hovering the logo-link in the sidebar at :: http://dev.drsk.se/YesKom/ ? It does the opacity right, it just doesn't show the HTML tooltip, any suggestions as to why this happens?
[05:51:39] <Onions> if theres no mailing list there there isnt one
[05:52:15] * greytrilby pulls hair out
[05:52:34] <greytrilby> Can someone please help before I baldify myself? I'm missing something obvious
[05:52:51] <Onions> ask the question grey
[05:52:54] <greytrilby> have a function called div2CK which works in 25 pages
[05:53:00] <greytrilby> all fine
[05:53:11] <greytrilby> click button, a div gets converted to an instance of ckeditor
[05:53:28] <greytrilby> suddenly it's stopped working in one page (and on that one page, it works in another instance
[05:53:46] <greytrilby> created a test page - ran the function in $(document). ready - worked a treat
[05:54:07] <greytrilby> changed said test page and put it in a click(function()) - it says it's not a valid function
[05:54:44] <Xotix> Anyway,  really need help on how to wrap a dragged table with a tr and a td tag. I don't get it i really stuck. can't be that hard...
[05:55:42] <daslicht> hello, I am new to jequery and I like to learn how to display data which I pull from the server as json in a list or table. Currently i just add elements to a empty table but this seems to be quite wrong. Anyone like to suugest me some good readings ?

[05:57:04] <nVee> I dont think im getting this entirelyt :)
[06:02:34] <sk8ball> ok, guys im using a jquery ui spinner (numeric 1- 30), each time the user changes the value of the spinner control i want a label (#lblFoo) to reflect: 30 - $('#spinner').spinner.value
[06:02:48] <sk8ball> i'm using jquery in conjunction with asp.net
[06:03:30] <hellofoo> so is it something like people prefer markdowns over wysiwyg these days ?
[06:03:32] <sk8ball> but th asp.net textchanged event isn't firing for the the #spinner textbox
[06:03:45] <sk8ball> how can i know when that value changes
[06:03:47] <sk8ball> ?
[06:04:59] <NodeX> is it an input ?
[06:05:43] <shesek> nVee, `continue` is a reserved word, you can't use that as a function name
[06:05:50] <shesek> aren't you getting a syntax error for that?
[06:06:21] <sk8ball> node, yes spinner is n input
[06:06:45] <sk8ball> actually an asp.net textbox
[06:06:49] <sk8ball> but yes an input
[06:06:56] <biodegabriel> Hi all, I'm using this sweet super-simple jQuery slideshow script from http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/simplest-jquery-slideshow , but I noticed something strange, and I want some advice. When you load the slideshow in a browser tab, and leave that tab for a while (1 or 2 min) when you come back to the tab, the slideshow races through the slides (like it's trying to catch up to the point it should have been at by that point). Has any
[06:06:56] <biodegabriel> seen this before? Any ideas on solutions? Or should I even bother trying to fix this minor problem?
[06:06:58] <NodeX> $("#the-spinner").change(function() { $(this) <----- that is the spinner
[06:08:58] <sk8ball> and for the label i wouls set the value like $('#mylabel).val =$(this).value ?
[06:09:14] <NodeX> val($(this).val());
[06:09:33] <NodeX> $("#the-label").val($(this).val());
[06:09:49] <sk8ball> because i can get the value of the spinner like $('#spinner')spinner.value
[06:10:01] <NodeX> then get it like that
[06:10:05] <sk8ball> .spinner.value
[06:10:10] <sk8ball> ok thx for the help
[06:10:11] <NodeX> $("#the-label").val($('#spinner')spinner.value);
[06:13:52] <sk8ball> so in the-label's change function i could do $("#the-label").val(30 - $('#spinner').spinner.value); and the-label will always be 30 - the value of spinner
[06:13:53] <sk8ball> >
[06:13:56] <sk8ball> ?
[06:14:16] <sk8ball> or
[06:14:27] <sk8ball> the-spinner;s change function
[06:14:36] <sk8ball> i mean
[06:15:47] <nVee> shesek: Sorry, it was the wrong pastebin :) http://pastebin.com/StJ34q0z
[06:15:52] <nVee> I am not getting this concept
[06:16:08] <nVee> the code I pasted does not work, but I am not entirely getting how, or why, it does not work
[06:16:27] <shesek> okay
[06:16:29] <nVee> or the logic behind it rather. I am assigning the variable
[06:16:30] <shesek> let me ask you that
[06:16:34] <nVee> okay?
[06:16:53] <shesek> var data; $.get('/foo', function(d){ data = d; }); alert('there');
[06:17:12] <bot-t> nVee, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[06:17:39] <shesek> If it takes the server 30 seconds to send the response, you think it'll delay the alert until the response comes back?
[06:17:51] <nVee> hmmmm
[06:17:58] <nVee> ahhhhh
[06:17:58] <shesek> whoever sent this to him... I already gave him links to it
[06:18:07] <e6nian> I can't bind any events on my dom, even in chrome console. what would be the problem
[06:18:32] <nVee> so, we need to call a function afterwards when the data has been received
[06:18:52] <shesek> When you make an AJAX request, it doesn't pause the script execution
[06:19:00] <shesek> it just goes on
[06:19:26] <shesek> any code after the $.(ajax|get|post) doesn't wait for the response to come back, its executed immediately
[06:19:31] <nVee> okay
[06:19:41] <nVee> that makes sense ...
[06:19:47] <nVee> (never thought about it that way) :P
[06:19:55] <shesek> so your `alert(uid)` is called before the response comes back
[06:19:56] <nVee> okay, so how do I overcome this?
[06:19:59] <NodeX> you can make it syncronous if you need to
[06:20:05] <shesek> NodeX, don't even mention it
[06:20:11] <nVee> hahaha
[06:20:20] <nVee> yeah, i want the most reliable option here :P
[06:20:27] <molavy> why this error happen:
[06:20:28] <molavy> Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMHTMLTextAreaElement.setSelectionRange]
[06:20:33] <NodeX> if you need ti to be syncronous then make it syncronous
[06:20:42] <shesek> NodeX, but he doesn't
[06:20:42] <juro> hi, I am having problems with change() on a select field. I am updating a different hidden field with a value, but it always is 0: http://pastie.org/2793353
[06:20:50] <molavy> at this line
[06:20:51] <molavy> input.setSelectionRange(selectionStart, selectionEnd);
[06:21:02] <NodeX> [13:18:25] <nVee> so, we need to call a function afterwards when the data has been received
[06:21:06] <shesek> nVee, simply make sure you're referring to data that comes from the AJAX response in the AJAX callback, or anything that executes after that
[06:21:07] <NodeX> sounds like it
[06:21:46] <HiDensity> thanks shesek!
[06:22:07] <shesek> NodeX, talking about syncronous requests is blasphemy
[06:22:23] <shesek> there's no reason to do that, ever
[06:22:27] <nVee> okay, shesek, how do I overcome this?
[06:22:43] <shesek> nVee, again, simply make sure you're referring to that data inside the callback
[06:23:06] <nVee> i mean, I have my ajax call, what method is used which can assign data (as I need it) only once the data is received?
[06:23:13] <shesek> put that alert (or any other reference to `data` or `uid`) inside the success callback
[06:23:20] <shesek> or inside other functions that are called from the success callback
[06:23:42] <shesek> you're assigning it correctly - but you're trying to use it before its being assigned
[06:23:54] <nVee> shesek: In my case, my application will need the userID assigned to a variable as I use it a number of times
[06:23:57] <shesek> if you'll open Firebug / Developer Tools and write `alert(uid)` you will see that
[06:24:10] <nVee> the userID wont change, it literally just needs to be assigned to a variable so I can use it whenever I need
[06:24:26] <shesek> it is assigned to the `uid` variable, just not when you're trying to access it
[06:24:29] <nVee> If I understand you correctly, i will need to call the function each time I need the userID?
[06:24:34] <shesek> no
[06:24:52] <shesek> you need to make sure that you're accessing the variable AFTER the response came back
[06:25:07] <shesek> meaning that any code that needs access to it should be executed from the success callback
[06:25:29] <nVee> shesek: based on this: http://pastebin.com/StJ34q0z - Why is it not working?
[06:25:45] <NodeX> [13:22:00] <shesek> NodeX, talking about syncronous requests is blasphemy .... no it's not lol
[06:25:52] <nVee> I assume that the .success() method only works once there was a ajax success request?
[06:25:58] <NodeX> sometimes people need a syncronous request
[06:26:09] <shesek> NodeX, give me one good example
[06:26:44] <shesek> nVee, the place your `alert(id)` is located doesn't care about the AJAX request
[06:26:50] <NodeX> err when you need the to wait for the response wtf ?
[06:27:02] <shesek> the server could be down, the internet connection could be dead, and it'll still be executed
[06:27:16] <NodeX> and ?
[06:27:28] <NodeX> the logic in the reuqest makes sure it's sane to execv
[06:27:31] <NodeX> exec*
[06:27:35] <NodeX> request*
[06:27:42] <shesek> if you need access to something that comes back from the response, do it either in the success callback, or in another function that's called from the success callback
[06:27:51] <shesek> NodeX, that wasn't meant for you
[06:28:04] <NodeX> ^^ functions in responses are a bad idea
[06:28:04] <biodegabriel> Ah, I see i'm not the only one. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7065145/jquery-simple-slider-problem-when-browser-tab-not-active
[06:28:06] <shesek> why would you want to stop script execution and block the UI until the response come back?
[06:28:12] <ajpiano> NodeX: what are you on about
[06:28:17] <ajpiano> synchronous ajax is a terrible idea
[06:28:23] <ajpiano> it locks the browser until the request returns
[06:28:23] <NodeX> ajpiano : no it's not
[06:28:27] <shesek> ajpiano++
[06:28:28] <ajpiano> yes, it is.
[06:28:32] <nVee> shesek: I understand the logic, but the problem here is that the rest of my application cannot go on without the userID. So in essence, is there a way to a) assign var b) do the ajax call and then c) assign the uid to a variable. If the variable cannot be assigned, stop the script, or atleast wait until we can?
[06:28:37] <NodeX> in your opinion it is
[06:28:47] <ajpiano> it's not a matter of opinion
[06:28:48] <NodeX> in certain circumstances it's needed
[06:29:07] <ajpiano> MAYBE in a very very limited circumstance, yes
[06:29:11] <NodeX> boomo
[06:29:15] <NodeX> and there you go :)
[06:29:29] <NodeX> this black/white approach to programming is very nieve
[06:29:31] <shesek> NodeX, the only case where I ever needed it, is when I tried to exploit that in the `onbeforeclose` event to stop the browser from closing the tab
[06:29:40] <shesek> making the website impossible to close (in some browsers)
[06:30:01] <ajpiano> but that doesn't mean it's a good suggestion to provide to someone who simply is yest to understand how async things work
[06:30:19] <NodeX> at what point did I say it's good to do it all the time ... err never... I said "it's needed at certain times"
[06:30:22] <Xotix> How is the dropzone made in jquery?
[06:30:29] <shesek> nVee, so just execute the rest of the application after the success callbakc
[06:30:32] <danzik17> a better move is to put some kind of div overlay with a "loading" icon or something rather than lock the browser imo
[06:30:38] <danzik17> that way the user is getting feedback
[06:31:02] <ajpiano> NodeX: "not understanding asynchronous behaviour" is not one of those times
[06:31:27] <ajpiano> nVee: you can use deferreds, or, as shesek says, just trigger your application from the ajax success callback
[06:31:32] <shesek> nVee, instead of writing the rest of your application after the $.post call, write the rest of your application inside the success callback
[06:31:52] <nVee> okay
[06:31:53] <ajpiano> or organise your code so you can call application.init() or whatever inside of the $.post callback
[06:32:06] <ajpiano> writing your javascript like a gigantic story that happens from the top to the bottom isn't wise
[06:32:17] <ajpiano> but it takes  time to learn other approaches
[06:32:32] <nVee> ajpiano: you know my code so well, without seeing it ;)
[06:32:37] <shesek> NodeX, I've been programming for 11 years now, 8 of them in web environment, and I can't think of any legitimate case where one would want to use synchronous requests
[06:33:05] <shesek> not a single one
[06:33:44] <e6nian> I can't bind any events on my dom, even in chrome console. what would be the problem. http://showoff.relife.me
[06:33:49] <shesek> there's simply no reason to do that - whatever you want to do with it, you can do in the callback
[06:34:22] <shesek> e6nian, how are you trying to bind them, and how do you determine it doesn't work?
[06:34:51] <NodeX> shesek : that's nice
[06:35:19] <e6nian> shesek: every way I've tried that, I click or trigger that, nothing happended
[06:35:36] * NodeX runs off to get his autograph book
[06:35:38] <NodeX> lol
[06:35:52] <shesek> e6nian, oh, wow, that's a LOT of scripts you're loading there
[06:36:10] <shesek> I would start by trying to remove everything other than jQuery and see if it still doesn't work, than start adding them back slowly
[06:36:10] <e6nian> shesek: yep, it's a nightmire
[06:36:58] <e6nian> shesek: I just get this project.
[06:37:47] <shesek> NodeX, especially today, with TameJs and the likes, you can write asynchronous code that looks exactly like synchronous code
[06:37:58] <shesek> so its not even more convenient
[06:38:14] <NodeX> shesek : I think you think I care
[06:38:20] <ajpiano> NodeX: well care about this
[06:38:30] <NodeX> I dont, you will not convince me there is NO place for synchronous javascript
[06:38:39] <ajpiano> when people come here, it's because they don't *understand* asynchronous behaviour
[06:38:45] <ajpiano> and they need help understanding it
[06:38:52] <ajpiano> suggesting that they use synchronous ajax
[06:38:56] <ajpiano> in every single case
[06:39:01] <ajpiano> is not beneficial to anyone
[06:39:01] <NodeX> he asked how to halt execution until the request finished...
[06:39:11] <shesek> NodeX, when did he ask that? :O
[06:39:17] <NodeX> so I said "you can make it synchronous if you like"
[06:39:33] <anvandare> out of curiousity, when I bind a function to the document to unbind a function from itself, does this unbinding function also unbind itself?
[06:39:41] <NodeX> [13:20:55] <NodeX> [13:18:25] <nVee> so, we need to call a function afterwards when the data has been received
[06:40:08] <shesek> NodeX, how does that say 'halt execution until the request finished' ?
[06:40:28] <NodeX> right there in the text
[06:40:38] <anvandare> doc.bind('mousedown', foo); doc.bind('mouseup', doc.unbind('mousedown',foo));  <-- so do I also need to add doc.unbind('mouseup', doc.unbind(... ?
[06:40:51] <shesek> "call a function afterwards when the data has been received" sounds extremely like asynchronous behavior to me
[06:40:59] <ajpiano> do something after X finishes is not the same as stop everything BEFORE X finishes
[06:41:15] <NodeX> I never said it was
[06:41:17] <ajpiano> anvandare: the latter section of that simply isn't valid code
[06:41:28] <anvandare> i know that, i was simply illustrating
[06:41:47] <NodeX> just because you all assume somehting don't automatically think it's gospel
[06:42:08] <shesek> anvandare, you probably want doc.bind('mousedown', foo); doc.bind('mouseup', function bar() {doc.unbind('mousedown',foo);  doc.unbind('mousedown',bar); });
[06:42:08] <ajpiano> anvandare: you might want to consider using .one("mouseup", fn);
[06:42:39] <anvandare> ajpiano: thanks! didn't know about that one.
[06:43:06] <ajpiano> yea it seems like that's what you're after from your code
[06:43:29] <NodeX> here si the "probably"
[06:43:52] <Xotix> When hovering with a dragable over a dropable, jquery creates a "drop zone". How is this done?how cna i access this drop  zone?
[06:43:53] <NodeX> careful you dont get shutdown for using "probably" incase the user doesn't understand binding
[06:43:58] <NodeX> lol
[06:45:08] <sk8ball> NodeX take a look at this...
[06:45:10] <sk8ball> http://www.pastie.org/2793457
[06:45:36] <sk8ball> txtCommission is the jqeuryui spinner
[06:45:46] <NodeX> you have a syntax error
[06:45:49] <sk8ball> lblClientDiscount is a regular <lable>
[06:45:53] <sk8ball> label*
[06:46:37] <NodeX> $('#lblClientDiscount').val((30 - parseInt($(this).val()) + ' %');
[06:46:38] <NodeX> try that
[06:46:57] <sk8ball> ok
[06:47:02] <sk8ball> ty
[06:48:57] <molavy> what this error mean?
[06:48:58] <molavy> Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMHTMLTextAreaElement.setSelectionRange]
[06:49:16] <molavy> error happen at
[06:49:17] <molavy> input.setSelectionRange(selectionStart, selectionEnd);
[06:49:42] <anvandare> you did something terribly, terribly wrong and you should feel bad
[06:50:16] <impi> over the past two days, i was asking questions about how to get the value of an input, this url helped me:  http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onchange.asp
[06:51:11] <jbendotnet> after an example of something animated so it jitters/floats on the spot in a random fashion
[06:53:55] <juro> can someone please have a look at my change() problem?
[06:55:25] <molavy> any idea?
[07:03:14] <someone> hi, is online someone from jquery.com website maintaince team?
[07:03:15] <bot-t> (988 hours ago) <ProLoser|Work> tell someone to look at my code
[07:04:34] <dddbmt> How do I bind an event to an element that is triggered whenever the element comes into the DOM?
[07:10:32] <nVee> is it fair to assume that the anonymous function run as teh callback in a $.post() ajax call only runs after it received the data?
[07:11:08] <nVee> so in essence $.post("url","data",function(data) { do something; } = do something is only run when the ajax call has been completed?
[07:11:19] <mekab> nVee, yes that is why its called a callback.. it calls back after
[07:11:35] <nVee> mekab, what is the purpose of .success() then?
[07:11:51] <mekab> success is a conditional callback that occurs only if the post was successful
[07:12:12] <flyupth> gety
[07:12:13] <flyupth> hey
[07:12:23] <nVee> i see, so without success, it will run, irrespective if the callback was successful, where succes only works on a successful callback?
[07:12:31] <flyupth> What's a X3D browser that works with http://www.astronautica.com/owds.html
[07:12:53] <nVee> flyupth: chrome
[07:13:02] <nVee> :P
[07:13:12] <flyupth> you mean, chrome comes with the plugin
[07:13:22] <flyupth> Is that like Cortona 3D
[07:13:27] <flyupth> because I know Firefox has that
[07:13:42] <nVee> i have no idea to be honest
[07:13:56] <flyupth> I can't download Flux Player because Microsoft bought out the company
[07:14:08] <nVee> all i know chrome supports some new 3d plugin which allows you to do some 3d modelling within your browser
[07:14:21] <nVee> not sure if it's related :)
[07:15:04] <mekab> nVeem, yes
[07:16:02] <Daiben> hello
[07:16:20] <cafaro> $.hasData(el) returns false, while el.data() returns an object with properties. No changed where made to el in between.. How is this possible?
[07:16:35] <blackspotwiggins> nVee, flyupth new chrome and firefox have webgl
[07:16:41] <blackspotwiggins> its not a plugin
[07:16:50] <Daiben> when i load content in a dialog box with $.get and insert it with html my other ui widgets break
[07:24:46] <remx> hi
[07:24:59] <remx> is there a method to preventing reflows?
[07:25:18] <mekab> el, all items in js are objects
[07:25:32] <mekab> they are different because one is telling you that it is indeed empty
[07:25:40] <mekab> the other returns the object empty or not
[07:26:11] <blackspotwiggins> remx, yeah, never interact with the page in any way
[07:26:25] <mekab> lol
[07:27:00] <mekab> Daiben re intitialize your plugins
[07:27:15] <scar2> In standard javascript I can set the display value to "none" in order to hide a particular DIV, for example. Well, how do I add effects to that? Like instead of just "disappearing", i'd like to have it "fade out".
[07:27:18] <mekab> few are automatically state aware so you need to have them review the dom again
[07:27:53] <mekab> jQuery fadein/fadeout
[07:28:03] <mekab> http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[07:28:28] <blackspotwiggins> because googling "fade out jquery" is so hard.
[07:28:42] <mekab> lol
[07:28:45] <mekab> indeed
[07:29:10] <mekab> if anyone is interested I have a google-like suggest plugin you are free to use
[07:29:12] <mekab> http://www.programmers.org/index.php/2009/12/jquery-google-suggest-jquerygsuggestjs/
[07:30:18] <TimothyA> mekab: demo = ERROR
[07:31:29] <mekab> yikes
[07:31:38] <mekab> hang on ill fix that sorry
[07:32:24] <Kagetsuki> would anyone happend to know of a reliable way to get the position of the caret in px?
[07:35:07] <Fraz> hey
[07:35:41] <Fraz> does anyone know the best way to draw curved lines between points in jquery?
[07:35:47] <Fraz> like in this image http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cYY8R1IeFc0/TVbnS-0cBHI/AAAAAAAADcw/onpO3LcUJDw/s1600/kismet-Thrallala.jpg
[07:35:55] <anvandare> canvas
[07:36:21] <anvandare> you can't have curved lines in html
[07:36:32] <blackspotwiggins> tons of 1x1px divs are much better, no lie i maek jqueries
[07:36:48] <anvandare> sure, and you could also render your entire webpage like that :P
[07:37:20] <ajpiano> Fraz: see ?g jsplumb
[07:37:21] <bot-t> Fraz, jsPlumb 1.3.3 demo - jQuery - http://jsplumb.org/
[07:37:23] <Fraz> can i couple up canvas with ui?
[07:37:42] <Fraz> ahhh awesome
[07:39:08] <Fraz> thanks aj
[07:39:12] <Fraz> thats just what i need
[07:41:05] <molavy> what this error mean?
[07:41:12] <molavy> Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMHTMLTextAreaElement.setSelectionRange]
[07:41:17] <molavy> error happen at
[07:41:19] <molavy> input.setSelectionRange(selectionStart, selectionEnd);
[07:44:02] <ajpiano> you're probably like, doing something invalid when you try to highlight some text?
[07:44:09] <ajpiano> selecting a range that's too large or something?
[07:44:45] <ajpiano> or an input isn't in the DOM or something
[07:44:55] <mekab> it is fixed now, i apologize.
[07:45:49] <scar2> blackspotwiggins, mekab, my question was asked because i was curious as to the interaction between the javascript and the jquery
[07:45:53] <mekab> I would liuke to offer my goggle suggest plugin once more now that it is running: http://www.programmers.org/index.php/2009/12/jquery-google-suggest-jquerygsuggestjs/
[07:46:03] <mekab> if you hvae any questions let me know through programmers.org plz
[07:46:23] <nVee> hey guys, does anyone know how I can change the mouse pointer with jquery? The actual image?
[07:46:47] <mekab> use the style sheets nVee
[07:47:03] <mekab> "cursor: pointer"
[07:47:15] <mekab> alternatively you can make the cursor invivslbe and track it with your own div quite easily
[07:47:26] <mekab> that is IF you feel the need for a custom cursor anyway
[07:48:48] <mekab> scar2, jquery simplifies the animation for you however it works in a fairly standard way through css modifications
[07:48:50] <scar2> So, I have this code: document.getElementById("foo").style.display = 'none'; -- i am not sure how to add the fadein effect to a javascript set
[07:50:10] <nVee> mekab: I want a custom image cursor (as per clients request)
[07:50:27] <nVee> I tried cursor: url("location") auto;
[07:50:30] <nVee> but no success
[07:50:45] <nVee> anyways
[07:50:47] <nVee> thats CSS :)
[07:51:05] <scar2> nVee: http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/csscursors.shtml
[07:51:10] <scar2> style="cursor: url(mycursor.cur);"
[07:51:15] <scar2> only .cur and .ani files
[07:51:25] <scar2> unless you use a div tracking that mekab suggested
[07:52:57] <scar2> nVee does that help?
[07:54:22] <Devilshakerz> as of IE6
[07:55:30] <atrigent> hey guys... I'm trying to get a style on a detached element that comes from one of its classes
[07:55:38] <atrigent> and it only seems to work in firefox
[07:55:52] <atrigent> it doesn't even work in chrome
[07:57:52] <Daiben> mekab: i solved the problem it was that i was loading a page in a page with html tags what did break my code
[07:58:21] <scar2> How do I apply .fadeIn() to document.getElementById("foo").style.display = 'none';
[07:59:09] <manixor> Hey guys. I want to dynamically add all files from a folder into a div. All files are images. Any idea  how can do this?
[08:00:32] <Brodingo> scar2 $('#foo').fadeIn();
[08:01:26] <Xotix> The difference between ul.topnav > li and ul.topnav  li is that the last one select all li's even if there is a nested ul in there. and > just the first level?
[08:01:47] <cafaro> How to set selected option of a <select> box? Both el.prop("selectedIndex", 0) and el.val("") failed for me...
[08:01:49] <Brodingo> Xotix correct, > is for direct descendants
[08:01:59] <Xotix> good thanks
[08:02:35] <mekab> reference it directly
[08:03:21] <mekab> $("#foo").Attr("SelectedIndex", 1) or $("#foo").selectedIndex = 1
[08:04:24] <mekab> you have to remember that jquery is layered ontop of existing javascript.. its primary purpose is to allow for selection and reiteration among the specified selectors which saves you time
[08:05:25] <mekab> if you truely want to "get" jquery, get yourself a javascript bible and read it front to back, then look at jquery source... its quite simple
[08:06:01] <cafaro> makeb: I didn't know you could use these DOM properties directly on a jquery object? I already tried $("#foo")[0].selectedIndex I think though
[08:06:38] <mekab> it returns the native object so you can reference them that way
[08:07:06] <mekab> a simple sector like #foo is not much more than document.getElementById
[08:07:11] <mekab> *selector
[08:08:17] <mekab> you will only have arrays returned when you have more than one object ... so in this case you wouldnt want to reference [0]
[08:08:19] <mekab> sec.
[08:13:11] <Xotix> are the events of e.g. sortable like receive: called when the s cript loads by default?
[08:19:34] * sportman waves
[08:20:13] <sportman> could someone possibly point me to a useful jquery plugin that could produce a similiar result to the featured listings on this page? http://www.hartanovteam.com/
[08:21:10] <Trigger> You mena the menu?
[08:21:11] <sportman> it just shows 4 diff content items and lets you scroll to see others
[08:21:28] <Trigger> Oh that
[08:21:41] <Trigger> Search on jquery carousel
[08:22:05] <mekab> its just divs you can write this yourself... just look at the source on the link you provided
[08:22:15] <mekab> thats the beauty of unobfuscated js :)
[08:22:19] <sportman> :D
[08:22:20] <alvincrespo> yeah, look at src_static_6d757
[08:22:26] <alvincrespo> that has all the code you need to write it
[08:22:29] <alvincrespo> :)
[08:22:29] <sportman> thanks guys
[08:22:33] * sportman opens up firebug
[08:22:59] <Xotix> how can i specify the placeholder from sortable?
[08:23:01] <alvincrespo> the plugin that person wrote is called:
[08:23:07] <alvincrespo> easyListSplitter
[08:23:23] <alvincrespo> line 5 of that js file
[08:23:29] <sportman> cool
[08:23:30] <sportman> :D
[08:23:36] <alvincrespo> np
[08:23:48] * sportman waits for second shot of expresso to kick in
[08:23:51] <sportman> thanks a bunch guys
[08:27:29] <malletjo> Hello folks, under jquery 1.6.* and IE8, i got a crash on the currentStyle  function ( Line 6544 for 1.6.2 ) . The problem is it try to set style.left = '10px 10px 10px 10px' and it crash. I made a modification ( parseInt(value) ) and it seems to work. Anyone know about this bugs ?
[08:28:40] <snover> malletjo: uh, yeah, '10px 10px 10px 10px' is not even close to a valid value for the left CSS property
[08:28:49] <mekab> lol
[08:28:59] <mekab> snover has a point there
[08:29:11] <malletjo> snover,  indeed but the value of name is "padding" and ret = '10px 10px 10px 10px'
[08:29:31] <mekab> well is it padding or style.left ....?
[08:29:33] <malletjo> no idea why they are trying to set this in style.left
[08:29:40] <mekab> yeah that doesnt make any sense
[08:29:58] <malletjo> style.left = name === "fontSize" ? "1em" : (ret || 0);
[08:30:03] <malletjo> This is the line in jquery
[08:30:20] <malletjo> name == 'padding'  and ret = '10px 10px 10px 10px' like i said
[08:30:22] <malletjo> so it crash
[08:30:41] <mekab> sounds to me like your css is jacked up
[08:30:54] <mekab> check there first, i have no issues with 1.6
[08:31:16] <malletjo> mekab, thx but it should not crash imho
[08:31:21] <malletjo> i will look into the css
[08:32:42] <mekab> in this case the performance would offset any kind of try catch or parseint here so its not worth it
[08:32:46] <mekab> though I do understand your point
[08:33:23] <mekab> certain browsers will handle the same code differently as well... so u have to keep that in mind
[08:33:37] <mekab> ie7 for example may toss out any invalid assignments and not throw an error
[08:33:50] <mekab> where as ie8 may not due to w3c standardization
[08:34:02] <rahmen> Hi! I have a script that is downloading a lot of information and then printing some graphs (could be many graphs). During the downloading I can easily create a loading animation. But when the download is complete and the script is focusing on printing the graphs the loading animation (gif) freezes. Is there a way around this? I want the gif to keep on spinning
[08:34:07] <mekab> its the pain we all live with but jquery has made that world a lot easier to work in at least
[08:34:38] <mekab> Rahmen, yes you need to fire it in a seperate thread
[08:34:50] <mekab> use setTimeout
[08:34:55] <malletjo> mekab, thx
[08:37:31] <mark_locklear> Hey folks, I'm got some jquery I'm dealing with that looks like http://pastie.org/2793956 is there a way I can format the html: line and break it up into multiple lines for easier editing?
[08:37:46] <rahmen> mekab: correct me if I'm wrong: setTimeout will only delay the freezing? Instead of doing the hard work now - do it in a few seconds and the gif will freeze anyhow?
[08:38:56] <ajpiano> mark_locklear: you can either use multiline strings ( \ ) or do it as an array with .join("") at the end
[08:39:01] <Aamir> ?source animate
[08:39:02] <bot-t> Line#8182 - "animate: function( prop, speed, easing, callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#8182
[08:39:22] <mark_locklear> ajpiano, Thanx!
[08:43:25] <malletjo> mekab, i removed 2 " padding : 10px 10px " and i don't have the error anymore. But i don't know why. padding: multivalue is not supported in IE8 ?
[08:50:49] <AdvoWork> hi there. Any reason why when doing $.post("/add-events.php", {...} it send info and does whats in add-events.php but not mail() ?  mail() works every where else, but doesnt appear to when i call a php file like that?
[08:52:55] <NodeX> what's the error you get from php ?
[08:53:00] <johnkpaul> reading through jQuery's source, I'm 90% sure that I'm right, but I'd like to confirm....multiple document.ready calls fire in the order in which they were added, is that right?
[08:53:25] <rook2pawn> Â is there  away to add a callback after .append ?
[08:53:38] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: yup.  all event bindings work that way.
[08:53:57] <johnkpaul> great, thanks ajpiano
[08:54:43] <ajpiano> rook2pawn: var oldAppend = $.fn.append;  $.fn.append = function( html, callback ) { return this.each(function() { oldAppend.call( this, html );  callback.call( this );  });   }
[08:54:56] <ajpiano> rook2pawn: BUT there really isn't a need for a callback for append, it should happen synchronously
[08:55:30] <AdvoWork> NodeX, i dont get an error at all, it just doesnt work for some reason, but all my other files work fine :S
[08:55:51] <NodeX> php will spit out an error if it's not called properly
[08:55:52] <rook2pawn> ah it would be cool if there were in-built flow control like a .next
[08:55:58] <rook2pawn> using an internal ee
[08:56:12] <NodeX> look in your error log or turn on error reporting quick;y
[08:56:55] <rook2pawn> i would imagine it is hard to get it to be synchronous since we're waiting on the DOM to do its thing
[08:57:27] <rook2pawn> unless .append code was really gnarly where it inspected what you were trying to put in
[08:57:28] <AdvoWork> NodeX, it is called, if i turn it on in the file, will it still show?  looked in /var/log/apache2/error.log and nothing
[08:58:32] <NodeX> AdvoWork : it's really a php question but if the file you are calling is usualy called as say an include then it will freak out because a $.post() is like requesting it from a browser as a new page
[09:06:23] <AdvoWork> NodeX, oh, that may be so, any suggestions then?
[09:09:31] <tman>  
[09:09:41] <lundy> heya guys, is there a way of generating something like ammmmmmm if product1 is clicked show it up in the items list, but if its clicked again then update the quanity in the list ...
[09:16:07] <lundy> anyone?>
[09:16:26] <smplstk> lundy: yes
[09:16:34] <lundy> heya guys, is there a way of generating something like ammmmmmm if product1 is clicked show it up in the items list, but if its clicked again then update the quanity in the list ...
[09:16:58] <Brodingo> ammmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[09:17:00] <smplstk> lundy: you don't need to repeat yourself.
[09:17:23] <lundy> sorry :(
[09:17:38] <smplstk> lundy: that's kind of a non-specific question, though
[09:18:45] <lundy> im trying to build a ePOS for my friend, its for a Bar which is just going to be doing over the counter sales...
[09:20:43] <Alan> hmmm, i wonder if i'm going about this the right way...  I'm trying to make a single desktop/mobile application using jquery mobile, but trying to make it so it literally has no backend to it
[09:20:55] <Alan> it is communicating with some API over JSON-RPC
[09:21:11] <Alan> is this actually a reasonable thing to try and do with jquery mobile at the moment?
[09:21:26] <hooloovo1> Alan: Sounds kinda slow, but you can try.
[09:22:09] <remx> hi
[09:22:16] <hooloovo1> remx: o/
[09:22:21] <remx> should the latest jquery be used at all times?
[09:22:40] <Brodingo> ideally the latest stable release
[09:22:56] <hooloovo1> remx: i think that's up to you, but i don't see a reason not to use the latest stable all the time.
[09:22:56] <Brodingo> but sometimes you might have legacy stuff that needs older versions
[09:23:20] <Alan> hooloovo1: you think I'm much better off having a webapp doing the grunt work of talking to the API and generating HTML?
[09:23:29] <remx> what if functions become deprecated? i'm not familiar with the jquery system to be able to debug or analyse them, or even fix them
[09:23:55] <ajpiano> remx: every single function that doesn't exist in javascript breaks the same way: "X is not a function"
[09:23:55] <hooloovo1> Alan: i think a backend generating the html is the fastest way, yes.
[09:24:07] <ajpiano> remx: also we try to not break backwards compatibility
[09:24:07] <hooloovo1> Alan: and use ajax only on live changes to the site
[09:24:15] <ajpiano> and when we do the changes are highly document
[09:24:21] <remx> ajpiano: ok thank you
[09:24:30] <ajpiano> Alan: i think your approach is perfectly reasonable.  templating small amounts of html on the client side is really not a perf hit
[09:24:39] <jwm> no more $("..", object) :(
[09:24:43] <jwm> I like that way
[09:25:15] <hooloovo1> ajpiano: you don't think it'll be a noticable difference loading stuff with ajax request after page load? would be neat if it was about as fast.
[09:25:27] <Alan> ajpiano: in terms of "small amounts" i'm on about a few hundred list items on page load
[09:26:07] <ajpiano> hooloovo1: it pretty much is... it might bog down with large amounts of elements
[09:26:12] <Alan> maybe it helps if i say what i'm developing: a mobile-friendly frontend to deluge bittorrent client
[09:26:16] <ajpiano> but as long as you're running the entire thing and making just one append
[09:26:21] <ajpiano> it should be reasonably performant
[09:26:40] <alvincrespo> @Alan - you might be able to use jquery mobile with backbone and underscore
[09:26:41] <Alan> ajpiano: i'm not sure if the repeated appends or the .listview('refresh') is the horrible bit...
[09:26:53] <ajpiano> repeated appends is a killer
[09:27:00] <alvincrespo> if you're planning to not have a backend
[09:27:02] <ajpiano> you want to touch the dom as little as possible
[09:27:08] <ajpiano> alvincrespo: i was about to make the same suggestion as alvincrespo
[09:27:19] <alvincrespo> or to interact with it minimally
[09:27:25] <alvincrespo> we're using it on a project here
[09:27:32] <hooloovo1> ajpiano: yea, i thought the response time on cell was horrible unless you use wifi
[09:27:39] <alvincrespo> were we query the db just once, if necessary, and then just work with the models
[09:27:47] <alvincrespo> until its necessary to save/reload that info
[09:27:56] <Alan> alvincrespo: is backbone just an extra event system?
[09:28:05] <ajpiano> hooloovo1: the response time won't change whether or not the transformation from data to html is happening on the client or the server
[09:28:22] <ajpiano> Alan: no, backbone is a client side "mvc" framework
[09:28:46] <hooloovo1> ajpiano: but don't it have to run two requests when getting the content with ajax compared to one with the server generate the code and send it?
[09:29:01] <hooloovo1> once for the html file and another time for the json data
[09:29:04] <winterdj> hi all. I need to try and mimic a JS confirm dialog. I'm bringing up a styled div when clicking a link, and when clicking on the confirm button, I want the trigger the original link (that opened the div) click event. I think because I'm using e.preventDefault() in the function to open the div, I then can't trigger the original click event - any ideas/suggestions?
[09:29:16] <ajpiano> hooloovo1: the templates would all be loaded already
[09:29:22] <alvincrespo> @Alan, Backbone.js is a framework like any other that ties into jQuery using the MVC model
[09:29:23] <ajpiano> you don't have to get the template fresh with every request
[09:29:40] <ajpiano> you just render the new data using a template
[09:29:53] <Alan> interesting
[09:30:05] <alvincrespo> @Alan, you should check out their docs: http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/
[09:30:18] <Alan> alvincrespo: just found it
[09:30:25] <alvincrespo> and i have a few examples on github, that are commented and are easy to follow
[09:30:40] <hooloovo1> ajpiano: templates aren't my cup of tea so i don't really know how they work. i'll leave this to templating people now =P
[09:30:50] <alvincrespo> https://github.com/alvincrespo/Backbone-Experiments
[09:30:52] <ajpiano> hooloovo1: you'd be well served to loan
[09:30:54] <ajpiano> to learn
[09:31:05] <alvincrespo> @Alan, hopefully that helps with what you need to build.
[09:31:16] <ajpiano> hooloovo1: a template is just a string of html that has tokens in it, which is transformed into a function, so you can replace live data into the html template
[09:31:27] <hooloovo1> ajpiano: might do that really soon. just need a free day =D
[09:31:30] <ajpiano> ok
[09:31:50] <Alan> alvincrespo: thanks, i'll take a look at the docs and see what it does
[09:32:11] <hooloovo1> ajpiano: doesn't sound so bad. i've made simple stuff that works kinda like that before and it's been useful.
[09:32:37] <ajpiano> hooloovo1: yeah, a simple function that returns a similar string of html with different data when the data is passed is essentially a "template" as well
[09:33:13] <Alan> well then the other question is, where am i supposed to hook to do what i want?
[09:33:30] <Alan> i need the "loading" spinner to come up during the first page load, and only go away when the page is ready...
[09:34:06] <Alan> the jquerymobile docs aren't too bad, but they could really do with some lifecycle diagrams like android has for certain things....
[09:34:49] <Alan> http://developer.android.com/images/activity_lifecycle.png  <-- my favourite bit of Android documentation so far
[09:35:05] <ajpiano> Alan: this is where something like backbone's Router would be useful
[09:35:37] <ajpiano> cause then you can make your links do all hashchange/pushstate navigation
[09:35:47] <ajpiano> and then make your app take actions based on it
[09:36:44] <ajpiano> so when they hit like, #search, you go off and do an ajax request, get your api results, pop them into the page, and then navigate
[09:37:11] <Alan> ajpiano: still seems like i there is an event i need to intercept...
[09:37:27] <ajpiano> obviously
[09:37:50] <gdoteof> I need to check the inline width style of a particular div and issue a command or not based on it having a specific width
[09:37:57] <gdoteof> is this something I can do?
[09:38:06] <ajpiano> it's probably something you shouldn't do, but you can
[09:38:23] <gdoteof> basically if <div class="foo" style="width:260px;"> then do something
[09:38:37] <gdoteof> if <div class="foo" style="width:0px"> don't that thing
[09:38:43] <ajpiano> that is a really bad way to structure an application :/
[09:38:45] <ajpiano> use classes man
[09:38:47] <shiftingcontrol> My document goes like <p class="message"><p class="replace">1</p></p><p class="message"><p class="replace">2</p></p>, I have a jquery $('.replace').html('no 2'), I want jquery to match the class=replace with is the last match. here i need to replace 2 not 1, how can i do this
[09:38:59] <gdoteof> ajpiano: right, i am modifying something existing though
[09:39:10] <ajpiano> modify it to use classes
[09:39:10] <ajpiano> :/
[09:39:19] <gdoteof> i was hoping for a class or something to be indicative, but there are none
[09:39:22] <ajpiano> shiftingcontrol: $(".replace").last()
[09:40:03] <gdoteof> ajpiano: any hints on doing it the way i am talking about?  i know it's not ideal, but I can't alter the existing code.  i mean, i *can* but I would be breaking spec by doing so
[09:40:05] <Alan> so with my list updates, i really should be building one massive string and setting mylist.html(thestring) ?
[09:40:27] <ajpiano> shiftingcontrol: you can also do all of them by doing $(".replace").text(function( i, t) {  return "no " + t; });
[09:40:30] <shiftingcontrol> ajpiano, :P
[09:40:39] <shiftingcontrol> it worked thanks
[09:40:58] <ajpiano> gdoteof: if ($(this).width() == 260) { }  ?
[09:41:19] <gdoteof> ajpiano: oh
[09:42:28] <dvorak_> What's the best VRML/X3D plugin for Linux/Windows? I need it to view the worlds linked from http://www.astronautica.com/owds.html Octaga, BS Contact and Cosmo Player don't work.
[09:42:57] <dvorak_> I mean Octaga does but it doesn't show the labels, and http://www.extrasolar.net/vrml/starmap.wrl doesn't even work in Octaga player
[09:43:09] <ajpiano> dvorak_: are you sure you want to be asking this in #jquery
[09:43:14] <dvorak_> well why not
[09:43:26] <dvorak_> no one answers in other channels, why there are so many people here I don't know, perhaps because their job depends on it
[09:43:31] <dvorak_> I don't even know what jquery is
[09:43:58] <ajpiano> dvorak_: ...
[09:44:12] <sadmicrowave> wow
[09:44:15] <NaBro> sometimes you feel like a nut...
[09:44:56] <ajpiano> dvorak_: IRC is typically grouped into channels by topic, one does not typically go into a specific purpose channel with many people in it and ask a quesiton that is not relevant to that channel just because there are many people there......
[09:46:06] <gdoteof> ajpiano: thanks, really straight forward.  worked perfectly
[09:47:48] <Alan> what the hell... my counts aren't showing up on mobile :(
[09:48:10] <Alan> do they only show up if there's enough room?
[09:57:12] <anvandare> interesting
[09:57:38] <anvandare> if you move a child element out to the side (with absolute positioning), the mouse going over it still counts as if the mouse went over the parent element
[09:57:55] <anvandare> i'm guessing this has to do with even bubbling
[09:57:58] <anvandare> +t

[10:26:44] <LabRaTT> can anyone help me with a jquery problem really quick?
[10:26:52] <andrew9183> hey guys, how do i select an attribute of "foo:bar" ?
[10:27:05] <andrew9183> ie, <td foo:bar="test">
[10:27:29] <LabRaTT> ok i have a few form elemnts i want to update on the fly... first the user will get an input textbox then when they click it will give them a jquery datepicker... then when they select a date i want it to post to a php file that will query the database and populate the next dropdown...
[10:27:29] <LabRaTT> here is the link to the sample page
[10:27:29] <LabRaTT> http://dreamweaverpresents.com/test/test.html
[10:27:31] <andrew9183> i tried .find("td[foo:bar]") but it doesn't work
[10:28:29] <NaBro> $('td').attr('foo:bar')?
[10:28:44] <andrew9183> oh, i can't do it with find ?
[10:30:06] <LabRaTT> ok i have a few form elemnts i want to update on the fly... first the user will get an input textbox then when they click it will give them a jquery datepicker... then when they select a date i want it to post to a php file that will query the database and populate the next dropdown...

[10:31:20] <andrew9183> oh it seems i have to escape the :
[10:31:34] <andrew9183> it worked if i did .find("td[foo\\:bar]")
[10:31:43] <ravenz> LabRaTT http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[10:32:04] <kborchers> LabRaTT: you have a syntax error on that pagte
[10:32:08] <kborchers> page*
[10:32:17] <LabRaTT> i did that... then i need to post selection to php page and return the updated query
[10:32:33] <LabRaTT> where is the syntx error?
[10:32:51] <NaBro> line 35
[10:32:58] <kborchers> open firebug or dev tools or what ever you use to debug and you'll see it
[10:33:12] <LabRaTT> k will check thx
[10:36:43] <dangerousdave> is the site just screwed up for me? http://jqueryui.it/demos
[10:37:19] <jedimind> depends on your definition of screwed up
[10:37:29] <NaBro> looks like the CSS isn't loading
[10:37:31] <kborchers> dangerousdave: that is a fake site
[10:37:41] <kborchers> notice the .it
[10:37:43] <ravenz> that's a non legit mirror
[10:37:51] <telagraphic> anyone know how to use a json api through jquery?  should i use ajax or getJSON()?
[10:38:20] <dangerousdave> ah shit!, thanks guys

[10:41:52] <LabRaTT> kborchers thanks i found the error
[10:42:07] <kborchers> np
[10:42:17] <dotnetted> Anyone know if it's possible to use a "required" dependency call-back inside a "remote" rule with jQuery validator?
[10:42:34] <telagraphic> can you pay people to help you with code here?
[10:42:38] <dotnetted> To only perform the remote validation call if a function returns true
[10:42:42] <LabRaTT> do i have to use return false? i updated the page http://dreamweaverpresents.com/test/test.html
[10:43:08] <dotnetted> Oops I meant:  jQuery Validate Plugin**
[10:43:41] <ryanneufeld> dotnetted: can you be more specific? You can define your own rules, so that might be a soultion
[10:45:29] <dotnetted> ryanneufeld: I only want a remote call for field1 to be performed if field2 is 'foo' - Ill get a pastebin up
[10:45:42] <ryanneufeld> not sure what you mean by remote call
[10:48:28] <dotnetted> ryanneufeld: http://pastebin.com/h9H6cr2a
[10:48:55] <dotnetted> this works fine but the ajax call is performed all the time - I need a conditional before the remote function is called
[10:48:57] <ryanneufeld> dotnetted: I didn't even know you could do that lol
[10:49:10] <ryanneufeld> dotnetted: then you need a custom rule
[10:49:29] <ProLoser|Work> does $.extend() all me to extend to objects in the traditional oo sense?
[10:49:36] <ryanneufeld> ProLoser|Work: no
[10:49:46] <dotnetted> would I still be able to use remote though? or would I create another custom rule with an ajax call?
[10:49:52] <andrew9183> is escaping a colon standard practice in jquery ?
[10:50:05] <ryanneufeld> ProLoser|Work: open the jQuery source and find it, it's pretty simple how it works
[10:50:16] <ryanneufeld> dotnetted: yeah, you just write your own ajax call
[10:50:20] <BarelyFitz> I escaped a colon once. took weeks to get clean.
[10:50:32] <ryanneufeld> BarelyFitz: and the smell never goes away
[10:50:44] <dotnetted> ryanneufeld: I had a sneaking suspicion that might be the case -- thanks for the info
[10:50:57] <andrew9183> lol barely
[10:51:26] <ryanneufeld> andrew9183: your question is very vague
[10:52:02] <ryanneufeld> dotnetted: yeah, it's no less a clean solution though. We have several custom rules. That we use for checking usernames etc
[10:52:12] <andrew9183> i'm using custom attributes, ie <p foo:bar="foo1">
[10:52:40] <andrew9183> is it standard practice to escape the colon in selecting it ? or are there problems around it
[10:52:42] <eugenmayer> how would i select an element with id #id1 not having the class Processed?
[10:53:25] <eugenmayer> cant find that operator. (or i would need a normal negation operator to negate [class~='processed']
[10:54:27] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: $("#id1").not('.class')
[10:54:53] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: but your ID should only ever return one thing. If you have duplicated IDS, then you are doing it wrong
[10:55:05] <eugenmayer> ryanneufeld: would that not be "select all childs of #id1 not having a class?
[10:55:35] <eugenmayer> ryanneufeld: your implication is just not presize :) Its about handling multiple ids
[10:55:47] <eugenmayer> but rather handler "i have initialized, dont need to do it again"
[10:55:54] <eugenmayer> (pretty common)
[10:56:01] <LabRaTT> ok now its not posting data to the process.php http://dreamweaverpresents.com/test/test.html
[10:56:01] <LabRaTT> anyone?
[10:56:16] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: well, I don't know what you're asking
[10:56:35] <eugenmayer> <div id="foo" class="processed">
[10:56:37] <danzik17> eugenmayer: what are you trying to do?
[10:56:40] <ryanneufeld> k
[10:56:47] <eugenmayer> dont match on this, match on <div id="foo>
[10:56:57] <LabRaTT> i just have an echo $_POST['dateSelected'] on process.php
[10:56:57] <LabRaTT> http://dreamweaverpresents.com/test/test.html
[10:56:59] <eugenmayer> (only)
[10:57:06] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: $('.processed');
[10:57:19] <danzik17> eugenmayer: for some kind of initialization purpose, correct?  what causes the initilization?  an event?
[10:57:42] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: $('#foo') will give you the div
[10:57:48] <eugenmayer> danzik17: drupal behviours
[10:57:57] <ryanneufeld> and you can test with .hasClass('processed');
[10:58:22] <danzik17> eugenmayer: dont know anything about drupal.  is a behavior like "click"?
[10:59:24] <eugenmayer> ok guys, i beg you to just answer the questions. Dont ask yourself why, is it good or do you like it :) : match <div id="foo">, and DONT match <div id="foo" class="processed">
[10:59:37] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: no
[10:59:52] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: I refuse to lead you in a direction of writing bad code
[10:59:57] <andrew9183> ditto!
[11:00:19] <ryanneufeld> if you help us understand the problem, you might find that we can give you an elegant solution.
[11:00:20] <eugenmayer> oh man, we are getting the status of #mediawiki in here?
[11:00:22] <eugenmayer> :)
[11:00:31] <ajpiano> $("#foo:not(.processed)")
[11:00:39] <ajpiano> eugenmayer: it still might not WORK if you have multiple #foo in the DOM
[11:00:39] <andrew9183> ryanneufeld: any advice on my question? :P
[11:00:43] <ajpiano> because jquery will only get the first one
[11:00:45] <ajpiano> and won't filter
[11:00:47] <eugenmayer> ryanneufeld: srsly just ignore me then, i will not at all expliain the "framework" to you.
[11:01:03] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: I don't know what that means, but we're trying to help.
[11:01:06] <ajpiano> eugenmayer: don't get self-righteous about keeping multiple IDs in your application, they're a very bad idea.
[11:01:21] <eugenmayer> goodness....
[11:01:49] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: that and I answered your question three ways
[11:02:02] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: what more do you want?
[11:02:08] <ryanneufeld> andrew9183: I didn't see your q
[11:02:17] <ajpiano> eugenmayer: there is no "right way" to process multiple items with the same ID
[11:02:37] <andrew9183> np, just asking if i can escape colons in searching for attributes, or does this break certain browsers ?
[11:03:02] <andrew9183> ie, i want to do .find("td[foo\\:bar]")
[11:03:06] <ryanneufeld> ?tryit @ andrew9183
[11:03:08] <bot-t> andrew9183, .contents() - Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[11:03:18] <ryanneufeld> andrew9183: did you try it?
[11:03:32] <ryanneufeld> andrew9183: hop over to jsfiddle and set up a test case
[11:03:41] <ryanneufeld> andrew9183: best way to learn
[11:04:00] <andrew9183> yeah i tried it, it works in two of my browsers.  but i have a limited browser range
[11:04:00] <telagraphic> anyone know how to read JSON with jquery?????
[11:04:26] <eugenmayer> ryanneufeld: you did not answer the question once, but anway i asked for $('#id:not(processed')
[11:05:02] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: 10:54 ryanneufeld: eugenmayer: $("#id1").not('.class')
[11:05:08] <ryanneufeld> same thing
[11:05:14] <eugenmayer> is that the same?
[11:05:19] <ryanneufeld> ?not
[11:05:19] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[11:05:21] <danzik17> actually better - the pseudo :not is slow
[11:05:26] <ryanneufeld> :)
[11:05:26] <danzik17> well, slow(er)
[11:05:28] <telagraphic> you want money for the answer? I can do that!
[11:05:33] <eugenmayer> more precisly, does that not mean "all children not having.." ?
[11:05:36] <ajpiano> but in either case, it will only get the first eleemnt with the ID #foo
[11:05:58] <eugenmayer> ryanneufeld: i see, its removing from the set. Yes would have worked. Thank you
[11:06:04] <ajpiano> ?parseJSON @ telagraphic
[11:06:06] <bot-t> telagraphic, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[11:06:07] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: and do you want the children of that div? Cause that's a different selector
[11:06:19] <eugenmayer> no i dont, i was guessing that was what you wrote
[11:06:33] <eugenmayer> but that would rather have been
[11:06:53] <eugenmayer> $(#id).find(':not:.processed)
[11:07:02] <eugenmayer> (but that was not what i asked for)
[11:07:24] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: right, so instead of having a snotty attitude, why not try what people suggest?
[11:07:32] <telagraphic> but i'm calling to an api, sendgrid, so isn't that a getJSON() method???
[11:07:46] <ajpiano> telagraphic: what are you actually asking?
[11:08:01] <eugenmayer> ryanneufeld: well to be honest, there are 2 ways of answering questions. You ask 10 others, coming back to the initial one, or answering the question.
[11:08:03] <ajpiano> you can use $.getJSON or $.ajax to fetch some JSON
[11:08:26] <ryanneufeld> eugenmayer: have a nice day
[11:08:47] <telagraphic> how to read a JSON feed
[11:08:58] <eugenmayer> ryanneufeld: people tend to not answer the question but rather "guide" you, e.g. suggestion things (and surely no correct implications ). An exaple would be "but you dont want multible elements with the same ID"
[11:09:28] <danzik17> because multiple ids === 'not correct'.
[11:09:46] <telagraphic> ok i get that, but i'm slow to this stuff
[11:09:49] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ eugenmayer
[11:09:49] <bot-t> eugenmayer, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:10:28] <eugenmayer> I see, no you are getting childish. Anyway thank you for trying to help, have a nice day also
[11:10:52] <telagraphic> that is a good read
[11:11:24] <telagraphic> will that actually help with coding?
[11:11:26] <andrew9183> refreshing an iframe -> google says to change the src of the iframe to the same src as a hackaround.  is this the proper way ?
[11:11:56] <LabRaTT> i have a page at this link http://dreamweaverpresents.com/test/test.html  and i have a process.php that all its doing is echoing  $_POST['dateSelected'] i am not getting the date selected anyone?
[11:12:14] <telagraphic> anyways, i've tried the code and it still isn't working, I'm using rails 3
[11:12:15] <kborchers> eugenmayer: this is the point everyone is trying to make http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/4rS2F/ you will not select the 3rd div even though it matches your selector
[11:12:45] <eugenmayer> kborchers: i simple _dont_ have elements with the same id :)
[11:13:00] <ajpiano> telagraphic: $.getJSON("someresource", function(data) { $.each(data, function(key, value) { //do something to each item  });  });
[11:13:08] <eugenmayer> kborchers: i just dont want specific things to happen twice on a element.
[11:13:40] <eugenmayer> kborchers: anyway an interesting point you made.
[11:14:11] <telagraphic> i've tried that, maybe it is something wrong with the output html code?  how do i detect a failure or success?
[11:14:31] <ajpiano> telagraphic: if you are outputting html from a call that expects JSON, that *is* the problem
[11:15:01] <ajpiano> LabRaTT: if your page isn't being rendered properly by PHP we can't help you with that here
[11:17:17] <danzik17> as stupid as this might sound - there there a way to make a custom deferred synchronous?
[11:18:39] <telagraphic> here is the code:
[11:18:40] <telagraphic> $.getJSON(stats, function(key, value) { 				$('<ul>', { 					id : 'sg_stats', 					html : '<li> ' + key + '</li><li>' + value '</li>' 				}) 	});	
[11:19:02] <ajpiano> telagraphic: you have to put that element that you create somewhere
[11:19:04] <telagraphic> i thought this is legit
[11:19:14] <ajpiano> you're just creating it and not putting it anywhere
[11:19:50] <telagraphic> i do have an appendTo() tag in the original
[11:20:22] <telagraphic> it still isn't even rendering
[11:20:26] <telagraphic> on the page
[11:20:27] <rabbi1> what is the best way to implement ajax for a completed php website ? need suggestion for books, articles.
[11:21:28] <telagraphic> could i be rendering the json file incorrectly?
[11:22:12] <ajpiano> telagraphic: is your callback actually even firing
[11:22:45] <telagraphic> ajpiano: where do i put a callback?
[11:22:50] <ajpiano> lol
[11:22:59] <ajpiano> oh wait
[11:23:02] <ajpiano> i see your code
[11:23:04] <ajpiano> is completley wrong
[11:23:22] <telagraphic> i knew i was missing something
[11:23:25] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:23:34] <ajpiano> the second argument to getJSON is the callback
[11:23:42] <ajpiano> INSIDE of that function you have to do the loop where you make the elements
[11:24:10] <foomarks> Trying to create a simple .fadeIn to .fadeOut and the URL jump splash page. What is the best way to call the URL jump after the last .fadeOut chain?
[11:24:29] <ajpiano> telagraphic: $.getJSON("someresource", function(data) { $.each(data, function(key, value) { $("<li>").appendTo("#foo")' });  });
[11:24:41] <telagraphic> so { $('<ul>', { id : 'sg_stats', html : '<li> ' + key + '</li><li>' + value '</li>' }) } doesn't do that???
[11:24:50] <ajpiano> it doesn't do all of it
[11:24:58] <telagraphic> hmmm
[11:25:01] <telagraphic> damn
[11:25:02] <telagraphic>  ok
[11:25:20] <telagraphic> so i need to use some element creation methods then
[11:25:25] <ajpiano> no
[11:25:26] <ajpiano> ...
[11:25:45] <ajpiano> you have to do that function nested inside of a loop
[11:27:04] <telagraphic> which function goes in the loop?
[11:27:06] <wpbest> Can you do a right click context pop up menu in jquery?
[11:27:12] <ajpiano> wpbest: yes
[11:27:20] <ajpiano> telagraphic: the one you have above?
[11:27:55] <wpbest> I'm releavively new with jquery. Is it done with a plugin?
[11:28:09] <ajpiano> there are plugins that do it yes
[11:28:48] <wpbest> are there examples?
[11:29:07] <rabbi1> what is the best way to implement ajax for a completed php website ? need suggestion for books, articles.
[11:29:26] <mekab> the documentation on jquery is extremely good and easy to read, I suggest starting there
[11:29:57] <ajpiano> wpbest: there are many that you can google and loko at, and or you can build your own using the $(document).bind("contextmenu", function(E) {});
[11:30:24] <mekab> as for rabbi, your question makes me wonder if you understand what ajax really is ... jquery which provides ajax methods is nothing more than javascript. the fact that you are using php makes no difference at all
[11:30:28] <wpbest> It doesn't give a good architecture overview of jquery.
[11:31:01] <wpbest> cool, ok, that's what i need
[11:31:05] <mekab> i disagree go here, http://api.jquery.com/ .... jump around, read the examples
[11:31:09] <telagraphic> so put a $.each loop in there?
[11:31:30] <DofLeFou> I need to add some of the social Media icon to my page â€¦.  anyone know off a really good plugin in Jquery that will do this
[11:31:41] <necromancer> hey does anyone know of a plugin offhand that does kinda what "Tweet!" does, except with Facebook? http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/
[11:31:45] <DofLeFou> in a slick and elegant way
[11:32:22] <necromancer> DofLeFou: www.sharethis.com is nice
[11:32:51] <telagraphic> i dont get this callback thing?
[11:34:44] <ajpiano> telagraphic: $.getJSON("url.php", /* THIS FUNCTION IS THE CALLBACK, IT GETS THE DATA */ function (data) {    /* DO A LOOP OVER THE RETURNED JSON */ $.each(data, function() { });  })
[11:35:03] <DofLeFou> necromancer: Something free
[11:35:29] <DofLeFou> that are look into tracking all the page loads for adv
[11:35:48] <DofLeFou> not quiet free in my opinion
[11:38:17] <bewilled> how do I draw a square in jquery and put other jquery elements inside that square?
[11:38:34] <mekab> anyway if you are looking for a book, you really need to understand javascript to "get" jquery, I got the first edition in 1998 http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Bible-Danny-Goodman/dp/0470526912/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1320172680&sr=8-1
[11:39:07] <mekab> jquery is a js api ... which makes working with dhtml one heck of a lot simplier than it used to be
[11:39:28] <mekab> but if you dont really understand what it is doing your just fumbling around without being an expert
[11:39:54] <tomasm-> hi, what might cause jquery.load() to update a container but not call the callback on success? the content still gets loaded, so i dont understand
[11:39:55] <necromancer> DofLeFou: how is it not free?
[11:40:13] <DofLeFou> they said it is free
[11:40:28] <wpbest> I'm watching the first podcase of yayQuery
[11:40:31] <DofLeFou> But looking at it closer
[11:40:33] <mekab> bewilled ... use a div, its dhtml.
[11:40:46] <telagraphic> ajpiano: is this correct then:
[11:40:49] <telagraphic> $.getJSON("url.php", function (data) {    $.each(data, function(key, value) {  		$('<ul>', { 			id : 'sg_stats', 			html : '<li> ' + key + '</li><li>' + value '</li>' 		}) 	}); })
[11:40:52] <DofLeFou> They will be collecting all the requested load
[11:41:02] <DofLeFou> request loads
[11:41:11] <DofLeFou> for advertisement purposes
[11:41:15] <ajpiano> telagraphic: it looks reasonable... if it isn't working in your app, you have to debug..
[11:41:19] <necromancer> DofLeFou: still free for you.
[11:41:31] <DofLeFou> yep
[11:41:31] <bewilled> mekab: can I set dimensions and color to a div?
[11:41:41] <DofLeFou> I don't wanna leave my footprint behind
[11:41:48] <necromancer> DofLeFou: regardless, that or an equiv service is what you're looking at if you don't want to develop it yourself
[11:41:49] <mekab> yes use css
[11:42:20] <telagraphic> we've read a lot about the sendgrid api, so how do  i know if it even connecting?
[11:42:51] <amh345> im having a sync issue. i have a .click that shows a div and then loads a function.  however it doesnt laod the function properly unless i have an alert(''); before the function.  im guessing that adds a delay and allows the .show() to apply.  is there a way i can check if that div.show() is success before i load the rest of the function?
[11:43:08] <ajpiano> telagraphic: what is the "sendgrid api"
[11:43:28] <mekab> check its display with css
[11:43:30] <ajpiano> telagraphic: you use basic debugging techniques outlined in this presentation: see ?ftj
[11:43:30] <bot-t> telagraphic, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:43:34] <mekab> if it is block or inline its visible
[11:43:54] <mekab> but you could also use a callback in this case as well
[11:43:55] <LabRaTT> jquery dateselectbox not working with post.. it works on the select box but not the date selector http://dreamweaverpresents.com/test/test.html
[11:44:05] <telagraphic> sendgrid is a SMTP email service for mass emails
[11:44:31] <ajpiano> telagraphic: i fail to see the relevance of that to this question
[11:45:04] <telagraphic> so were trying to get the statistics report from their JSON feed
[11:45:21] <telagraphic> for each email and then read into the page for users to see
[11:45:22] <ajpiano> sooo you're making a request of another domain?
[11:45:28] <telagraphic> yes
[11:45:32] <ajpiano> yeah that's not allowed
[11:45:34] <mekab> you cant do that
[11:45:37] <telagraphic> its not from our loca; servers
[11:45:42] <ajpiano> ?w same origin policy
[11:45:44] <bot-t> ajpiano, Same origin policy - In computing, the same origin policy is an important security concept for a number of browser-side programming languages, such as JavaScript. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy

[11:46:00] <mekab> thank you bot.
[11:46:02] <LabRaTT> jquery dateselectbox not working with post.. it works on the select box but not the date selector http://dreamweaverpresents.com/test/test.html
[11:46:24] <bewilled> mekab: where can I read about css properties that change the look of html divs?
[11:46:40] <mekab> i would start with w3c
[11:47:14] <LabRaTT> jquery dateselectbox not working with post.. it works on the select box but not the date selector http://dreamweaverpresents.com/test/test.html
[11:47:19] <telagraphic> ok, i get that
[11:47:22] <mekab> http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/NOTE-css-2010-20110512/
[11:48:11] <amh345> here's my pastie.  the alert allows the next line to load. http://pastebin.com/dvar4ZWv   is there a way to check if the .show() is active before i load that function?
[11:48:28] <mekab> i already answered that question
[11:48:41] <mekab> either use a callback, or check the display property it the divs style
[11:48:47] <mekab> *in
[11:48:47] <LabRaTT> jquery dateselectbox not working with post.. it works on the select box but not the date selector http://dreamweaverpresents.com/test/test.html
[11:48:55] <ajpiano> LabRaTT: stop spamming the same question repeatedly
[11:49:06] <mekab> labratt, it doesnt make it easier when you copy and paste the same question
[11:49:06] <telagraphic> so that code is only for making dynamic requests on my server, right?
[11:49:29] <ajpiano> telagraphic: if their service has a JSONP api you can use that
[11:49:36] <tomasm-> LabRaTT, i didnt catch what you wrote, can you say that again =)
[11:49:40] <mekab> telegraphic that is a property of javascript security in general, so the short answer is yes; however you can use jsonp to get around that
[11:49:42] <ajpiano> telagraphic: it will only *work* on your own server
[11:49:45] <LabRaTT> sorry
[11:49:54] <foomarks> Trying to make a URL jump after some chaining some animation and delay effects. However, once I add the URL jump at the end of the chain, it runs through the animation very quickly. Is there a better way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/foomarks/Q6Mmz/2/
[11:50:02] <LabRaTT> its just hard to get someones attention in here
[11:50:19] <telagraphic> they do have JSON api: http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/web-api/webapistatistics/
[11:50:33] <telagraphic> thats why i thought this code would have worked!
[11:51:31] <ajpiano> LabRaTT: debug your request
[11:51:38] <ajpiano> LabRaTT: the post is not sending anything
[11:51:52] <ajpiano> because the 'this' of the 'display' function is not the same as the 'this' of the function from which you call it
[11:52:09] <ajpiano> $(this).serialize() == "" when you call it in display(msg)
[11:52:12] <mekab> foomarks, that is not programmed correctly at all
[11:52:30] <foomarks> mekab: :( Suggestions?
[11:52:31] <mekab> you cannot chain events like this as they are non blocking threads
[11:52:33] <datlap> i m doing some validate on my form and put it here  $(document).but i want the validation func to be triggered when the form is submitted instead. how do i do that?
[11:52:50] <mekab> correction you can, but once you change the loc its going to execute immediately... if u get my drift
[11:52:58] <foomarks> (looking up non-blocking right now)
[11:53:11] <mekab> non blocking is just a threading term
[11:53:22] <mekab> ie it does not block the rest of the code from executing
[11:53:32] <tomasm-> LabRaTT, what are you trying to do?
[11:53:37] <LabRaTT> so should i take off serialize?
[11:54:04] <mekab> foomarks, yes you must use a callback
[11:54:11] <ajpiano> LabRaTT: no
[11:54:16] <ajpiano> you have to send the data that you want to send
[11:54:20] <telagraphic> ajpiano: they do have JSON api: http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/web-api/webapistatistics/
[11:54:21] <mekab> you will see it documented here: http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[11:54:27] <LabRaTT> i am trying to post the date selected to a process php and return an updated query
[11:54:32] <ajpiano> telagraphic: then use JSONP $.getJSONP and get it
[11:54:36] <ajpiano> sorry everyone i have to go
[11:54:41] <ajpiano> good luck fair #jqueryiers
[11:54:47] <mekab> l8r
[11:54:52] <foomarks> mekab: (scratching my head!) and also looking it up
[11:54:53] <LabRaTT> it works on the first boc but when i use the jquery UI datepicker it does not
[11:55:06] <ajpiano> LabRaTT: it has nothing to do with the jquery ui datepicker
[11:55:16] <ajpiano> LabRaTT: the scope of the functions changes when you call display
[11:55:23] <ajpiano> LabRaTT: i suggest you read see ?ftj
[11:55:24] <bot-t> LabRaTT, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:55:27] <telagraphic> aite, thanks a million man
[11:55:34] <telagraphic> ajpiano: thanks a million
[11:55:54] <ajpiano> np telagraphic good luck in all your future endeavours
[11:56:41] <LabRaTT> got it thanks
[11:56:44] <mekab> i personally use firebug and recommend it
[11:58:03] <danner> hi. im having a problem with the containment option on sortables, I'm using a table, the table rows are the sortables, and if I specify containment, i can only sort on the first drag and drop, then it breaks.
[11:59:02] <mekab> as with the last answer, you need to use a debugger
[11:59:09] <mekab> (danner)
[11:59:37] <mekab> i recommened firebug... its easy to use and self explanatory if you know how to program
[11:59:39] <mekab> just google it
[11:59:49] <danner> ...i have been using a debugger, but i just got into the channel, if you'd like to summarize or send me a PM with what has already been said?
[12:00:11] <bot-t> danner, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:00:12] <mekab>  http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:00:24] <danner> or, if you happen to understand the deal with hegihts breaking containment, i'd love that explaination.
[12:00:41] <mekab> though you shouldnt need this lenghty of an explanation if you know js...otherwise its worth the read if you are new
[12:01:38] <mekab> i have not personally had the need for sortables so I cannot answer that question
[12:02:11] <mekab> I've developed web apps for over 13 years but as of this year I have switched roles into a windows developer... though I can still help with most things.
[12:02:14] <danner> mekab, cool bro, but im not new to this, and there are no errors, and it is a known issue with sortables, without an explanation of table issues, only float:left issues
[12:02:52] <danner> i'll hang out here for a while, if anyone has experience with sortables and containment, i'm all ears.
[12:03:04] <mekab> all i would say is if its a known issue, don't fight it.. just write your own sort routine; that is fairly simple
[12:03:40] <telagraphic> bot-t : would you know how work with a JSON feed
[12:04:19] <kborchers> ?imabot @ telagraphic
[12:04:19] <bot-t> telagraphic, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[12:04:28] <danner> mekab, you're either a troll, someone I know making fun of me, a bot, or really dumb, and I can't decide.
[12:05:04] <telagraphic> bot-t: really, what the heck?
[12:05:05] <bot-t> telagraphic, It is decidedly so.
[12:05:18] <ajpiano> danner: i'm surprised you got sortable working half-decently on tables at all
[12:05:40] <ajpiano> danner: and there are definitely some issues with the existening containment in jQuery UI sortable
[12:06:02] <ajpiano> danner: personally, when i need sortable table rows, i currently use http://www.isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/
[12:06:04] <danner> ajpiano, works very well, other than some classy highlighting on linux/chromium.
[12:06:27] <ajpiano> and i say that as a member of the jquery ui team, lol :p
[12:07:33] <kborchers> ajpiano: FIX SORTABLE
[12:07:40] <ajpiano> :D
[12:08:59] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: and make it give a reference to the last added item on receive so I don't have to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[12:09:08] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: pretty please
[12:09:09] <danner> ajpiano, i'll need to do research on using a different sortable, but at the start, yes, tableDnD seems to not exhibit the behavior that ui sortables is doing.
[12:09:28] <bizznatchio> hey all
[12:09:57] <ajpiano> danner: the tableDnD is really straightforward cause it's only for tables, it doesn't do all the fanciness associated with a normal drag and drop... it just activates the one you click on, and as you move the mouse up and down, checks if the mouse is now over another row and, if so, moves it
[12:10:35] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: is there another way than the hack I'm using to get the last added item to a sortable in the receive callback?
[12:10:58] <ajpiano> i can't remember offhand ryanneufeld
[12:11:13] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: k
[12:12:36] <ajpiano> oh ryanneufeld what i did in that situation was not use the receive callback at all
[12:12:53] <ryanneufeld> oh?
[12:12:54] <telagraphic> bot-t: what do bots do?
[12:12:55] <bot-t> telagraphic, Outlook good.
[12:12:59] <danner> ajpiano, thanks for the help, at least I know the extent of the issue now
[12:13:19] <ajpiano> but rather the stop callback, and then iterated the children sortables and checked for the existence of a data flag
[12:13:37] <ajpiano> but that kinda made sense cause i was already iterating that collection no matter what on drop
[12:13:37] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: sounds computationally expensive
[12:13:49] <ajpiano> not really
[12:14:06] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: ah, for me I do an ajax call on receieve, to add the item to the collection in the DB
[12:14:27] <ryanneufeld> I don't need that called every time the stop happens
[12:14:59] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I could solve this with a dfd. though
[12:15:25] <ryanneufeld> create it in the receive, and resolve it in the stop
[12:17:50] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: yeah, agreed that no matter what it's less than graceful
[12:18:10] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: yeah, well I have it working pretty well right now
[12:18:22] <ajpiano> yeah - it's always possible to get it to work
[12:18:45] <ryanneufeld> and I converted the big ajax call in to a deferred, and used my first instance of .call()
[12:20:32] <Eviltwin> Are we reminiscing about problems we solved?
[12:21:27] <ryanneufeld> More discussing the many methods of skinning one cat
[12:21:42] <Eviltwin> I don't think cats appreciate being skinned
[12:22:34] <bizznatchio> \yawn
[12:24:41] <Eviltwin> I still have an unsolved problem
[12:25:01] <Eviltwin> But everyone tells me to do it a different way
[12:25:07] <Eviltwin> That I don't want to do
[12:28:51] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: well, have you considered that you can't do it the way you want to?
[12:29:37] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: or rather that it's not possible?
[12:29:47] <Eviltwin> It's not currently cleanly possible
[12:29:51] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/JVpGU/
[12:30:14] <ryanneufeld> what is it that you're attempting?
[12:32:38] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: that code is gross looking
[12:32:49] <ryanneufeld> I hope no one is paying you for that
[12:33:01] <ryanneufeld> cause it's not maintainable
[12:35:01] <Eviltwin> Right, and I don't write code like that. I just wanted to see if it was possible
[12:35:55] <ryanneufeld> oh, well, I'm sure you could do it kinda like that, but don't
[12:35:57] <Eviltwin> And every once in a while, it'd be nice to append the restulf of a $.map
[12:36:01] <ryanneufeld> that's just silly
[12:36:08] <Eviltwin> result*
[12:44:35] <molavy> why when i use $("#id_cc").setCursorPosition(curposition[3])
[12:44:43] <molavy> if id_cc is inpuy
[12:45:18] <molavy> it work well , but when it is textarea , textarea disappear
[12:47:17] <amh345> ok, i solved the image map thing i spoke about a few days ago.  does anyone know of a way i can place images in the areashape?
[12:47:55] <xckpd7> question: trying to make a 2 column layout... they both must be equal height (at least visually)... whats more expensive: jQuery to force them to be the same height, or a 1px by 50px repeating background image?
[12:48:04] <molavy> any idea?
[12:48:04] <xckpd7> in terms of page load / execution
[12:49:57] <jbrokc_> I have something I'm doing $("label").text().trim()   but is there a better way to trim the text inside than that?
[12:50:31] <jedimind> how much easier would you like it to be?
[12:50:59] <jbrokc_> jedimind: dunno, just wondering if there's a method that gets the text inside and trims it that I'm missing. usually there's a one-method way to do a multi-method thing in jQuery so I'm just curious
[12:51:47] <molavy> please check this
[12:51:48] <molavy> http://jsfiddle.net/WpqsN/27/
[12:51:51] <ajpiano> jbrokc_: .text().trim() won't work cross browser, use $.trim( $("elem").text() );
[12:52:03] <ajpiano> jbrokc_: there is not a special method for getting a trimmed string back from .text()
[12:52:33] <molavy> why when i change textarea to input it work but when i use textarea do nothing
[12:58:08] <kborchers> molavy: it works for me with the textarea ... once i remove the extra " in your selector of course
[13:00:34] <jbrokc_> ajpiano: great, thanks! also congrats on op status
[13:05:39] <datlap> i have arrival and departure date using datepicker. constraints are arrival is today or after. Departure is today+1. but it wont work. http://dpaste.com/645668/. any idea?
[13:17:11] <ryanneufeld> molavy: first of all you have a syntax error. So fix that.
[13:17:34] <ryanneufeld> molavy: and you might have better results
[13:37:31] <pmcgovern> hello everyone
[13:38:09] <pmcgovern> so this is bad syntax: if (trim(o.val()) == ''){      -- how would I check if a whitespace-removed value is empty?
[13:38:18] <jaequery> hi all, any jquery devs in here working from home?
[13:38:55] <eddiemonge> o.val().trim()
[13:39:18] <eddiemonge> but trim isnt supported in a lot of places
[13:39:24] <eddiemonge> jaequery: huh?
[13:39:43] <pmcgovern> ok, if it's not supported, what should I use instead
[13:40:22] <jaequery> hey ed, i was actually just thinking of you the other day
[13:40:24] <jaequery> lol
[13:40:28] <jaequery> how are you doin?
[13:40:32] <jaequery> what you up to
[13:40:36] <eddiemonge> pmcgovern: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[13:40:38] <kborchers> ?trim @ pmcgovern
[13:40:38] <bot-t> pmcgovern, jQuery.trim(str): Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[13:41:00] <eddiemonge> jaequery: thats kind of scary lol. im at the html5 newgame conference
[13:41:25] <jaequery> lol, hehe
[13:41:29] <pmcgovern> eddiemonge: This is still puking: if (jQuery.trim(o.val()) == ''){
[13:41:40] <pmcgovern> saying that o.val is not a function
[13:41:41] <jaequery> did i hear that you moved to LA?
[13:41:45] <pmcgovern> so my syntax is wrong
[13:42:08] <jaequery> or maybe that was some other dude
[13:42:35] <pmcgovern> should it be if (o.val().jQuery.trim() == ''){ ?
[13:42:43] <eddiemonge> pmcgovern: what is o?
[13:42:49] <pmcgovern> a passed object
[13:42:55] <eddiemonge> jaequery: no, still living in northern california at the moment
[13:43:07] <eddiemonge> pmcgovern: is it a jquery object? if not then it needs to be 0.value
[13:43:11] <eddiemonge> o.value
[13:43:23] <jaequery> ah ok
[13:43:35] <pmcgovern> eddiemonge: This just worked: if (jQuery.trim($(o).val()) == ''){
[13:43:55] <eddiemonge> jaequery: im not opposed to it though since i grew up in san bernardino
[13:44:44] <eddiemonge> pmcgovern: yeah because .val() only works on jquery object and wrapping o in $() turns it into a jq object
[13:44:55] <eddiemonge> but really, you should be using o.value since it will be so much faster
[13:45:34] <pmcgovern> eddiemonge: Noted & changed. Thanks for the insight - much appreciated
[13:46:32] <jaequery> you know, i am thinking of re-doing stiqr from scratch
[13:47:08] <jaequery> and this time, would like to open source it from start to finish
[13:47:50] <jaequery> but im not sure where to start, lol
[13:48:42] <eddiemonge> get the basic framework setup with a roadmap or at least the roadmap by itself
[13:48:45] <eddiemonge> github!
[13:48:57] <xckpd7> eddiemonge: haha
[13:49:35] <jaequery> i'm thinking of hooking up stiqr w/ a cms so i started on open source CMS built on Zend Framework, http://github.com/jaequery/jien
[13:49:57] <jaequery> now im not sure if i want to turn stiqr into it's own separate thing
[13:50:02] <jaequery> thoughts?
[13:51:56] <jaequery> i'd just like a real strong dev partner ... and been still searching for one ...
[13:52:54] <eddiemonge> are you still going to have a business model for the open source version or is it to get your name out there or something else?
[13:53:11] <jaequery> yeah i got a biz model in place
[13:53:22] <ale_> Guys, about the html5 canvas, how can I draw a rectangle with the moouse drag event?
[13:53:29] <Pilate> of course
[13:53:36] <jaequery> i've got a contract waiting for me to just get this out
[13:53:43] <jaequery> demand media / Y!
[13:54:05] <jaequery> it's a bit of a twist to what i have w/ stiqr
[13:54:11] <pmcgovern> I have another potentially stupid question. I'm trying to remove a div with a specific class name from the parent element. $(o).parent().remove($('.classToRemove')); can't possibly be the right syntax...
[13:54:19] <eddiemonge> ?g drawing a shape with the mouse using html canvas @ ale_
[13:54:19] <ale_> Anyone?
[13:54:20] <bot-t> ale_, Making and Moving Selectable Shapes on an HTML5 Canvas: A ... - http://simonsarris.com/blog/140-canvas-moving-selectable-shapes
[13:54:33] <jaequery> somehow, it seems to be going in the ad/banner side of things
[13:54:39] <jaequery> which is pretty good
[13:54:53] <eddiemonge> pmcgovern: $('.classname').remove()
[13:55:11] <eddiemonge> pmcgovern: api.jquery.com is your friend
[13:55:21] <pmcgovern> eddiemonge: there are multiple elements containing divs with that class name - I only went to remove the ones within the parent element
[13:55:22] <ale_> eddiemonge: no, I mean dragging like with paint, to create a rectangle
[13:55:34] <pmcgovern> *want
[13:55:37] <ale_> eddiemonge: an oval, a circle, a line, whatever
[13:55:42] <eddiemonge> pmcgovern: $('.parent').find('.class').remove()
[13:55:52] <pmcgovern> perfect! Thank you, eddiemonge

[13:56:20] <ale_> Ok!
[13:59:38] <lucenut> Hey guys. I am using http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker
[13:59:59] <lucenut> But I can't figure out how to keep the user from entering numeric nonsense into the field.
[14:01:56] <eddiemonge> lucenut: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-constrainInput
[14:05:07] <saba> Does anyone have a hacked version of Datepicker's parseDate, supporting time format, eg HH:MM?
[14:07:40] <lucenut> Eddiemonge, that link doesn't appear correct.
[14:08:22] <lucenut> I am using the http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#min-max but that only restricts what the user can select from the picker.
[14:08:37] <eddiemonge> lucenut: go down to options and look at constrainInput
[14:09:39] <lucenut> Ah thanks!
[14:09:53] <lucenut> Chrome didn't take me to the options tab.
[14:10:02] <necromancer> are there any jQuery plugins that provide a feed of your facebook updates kinda like "Tweet!"?
[14:10:41] <eddiemonge> lucenut: yeah its weird. you should file a bug for that at bugs.jqueryui.com
[14:11:03] <eddiemonge> necromancer: are your facebook updates public? most arent
[14:11:31] <necromancer> eddiemonge: it's for a page, but yes.
[14:11:55] <necromancer> i think im misunderstanding what an "access_token" is
[14:12:10] <necromancer> i have an app_id and app_secret OAuth key pair
[14:12:29] <necromancer> but i tried both in the access_token parameter for the open graph API and got "invalid oauth token"
[14:12:51] <eddiemonge> necromancer: might want to check the facebook api pages or ask facebook devs
[14:13:26] <ProLoser|Work> how can i trigger functions in the parent window?
[14:13:28] <ProLoser|Work> of an iframe?
[14:13:37] <saba> nvm, I've got it.
[14:14:35] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: easy. sed /frame//g
[14:14:56] <ProLoser|Work> eddiemonge: huh?
[14:15:17] <greedo> does jquery have nice strip html tags?
[14:16:26] <jirwin> erm. I'd think you'd just do it in javascript
[14:16:49] <jirwin> string.replace(/(<([^>]+)>)/ig,"") or something?
[14:17:57] <NaBro> i think you can drop the inner parens but yea...
[14:18:15] <greedo> yeah, I tried that but I still get some tags
[14:18:28] <jirwin> greedo: do you have an example?
[14:19:31] <greedo> a bit hard to illistrate on jsfiddle due to sop
[14:19:53] <eddiemonge> greedo: why do you want to do that?
[14:20:27] <greedo> http://aquaron.com/jquery/cloudinizr
[14:20:44] <greedo> I trying to generate a tag cloud
[14:20:50] <greedo> I'm*
[14:20:56] <greedo> dynamically
[14:21:18] <greedo> so I download a page and then jquery consumes it
[14:21:27] <jirwin> for any given html page?
[14:22:07] <greedo> yeah
[14:22:30] <greedo> I need to strip out the tags then cloudinizr will consume it
[14:23:16] <eddiemonge> theres a long, slow way to do it i can think of off the top of my head
[14:23:53] <eddiemonge> var str = ''; $('parent').find('*').each(function(){ str += $(this).text(); });
[14:25:20] <ProLoser|Work> how can i get a child window to trigger an event in a parent window with iframes
[14:26:23] <greedo> i thought about .html() maybe?
[14:26:55] <greedo> or .text()?
[14:27:23] <eddiemonge> greedo: did you see my example?
[14:29:42] <greedo> yes
[14:30:07] <greedo> so .get returns an object
[14:30:37] <greedo> so then
[14:31:06] <greedo> var str = data; var no_html =  $('parent').find('*').each(function(){ str += $(this).text(); });
[14:31:15] <greedo> would that be correct?
[14:33:08] <erichynds> greedo: you can just call .text() on the parent
[14:33:41] <erichynds> it'll traverse all descendants
[14:34:12] <greedo> no, go. cloudinizr is not happy.
[14:34:41] <eddiemonge> erichynds: i wasnt sure of that so thats why i had the .each
[14:35:11] <eddiemonge> greedo: what is data? what do you think no_html would be there?
[14:35:19] <eddiemonge> i bet its not what you think it is
[14:36:52] <DaOgre> Hey guys, I'm still pretty newbie at jQuery and am having a bit of a problem with some nested .each statements.  I threw something up on jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/DaOgre/7HNhz/.  I'd love if someone could help me figure it out, I'm just trying to populate some select's from a list of options
[14:38:33] <greedo> data would be a jqXHR object?
[14:39:35] <Dave_Stein> Da0gre takin a look
[14:39:42] <Dave_Stein> if fiddle decides to load
[14:40:16] <eddiemonge> greedo: it could be. its whatever you say it is. but your no_html would be the jquery object , not the string.
[14:41:15] <Dave_Stein> Da0gre fixin it up
[14:41:20] <DaOgre> @Dave awesome thanks man
[14:41:27] <greedo> oh, so I need a no_html.text()?
[14:42:01] <Dave_Stein> also in fiddles you dont include script tag
[14:42:17] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/7HNhz/3/
[14:42:20] <DaOgre> ah ok... I'm ALSO new to fiddle... just made an account upon joining this room :)
[14:42:44] <Dave_Stein> remember anything in $('#poop') is CSS so select.operator would look for a select el with that CLASS
[14:42:45] <Dave_Stein> not ID
[14:42:57] <Dave_Stein> so even that each is superfluous in the example since it's going by ID
[14:43:13] <Dave_Stein> but it would work super on multiple selects, if they all had the class
[14:43:22] <Dave_Stein> anddddd .operator is faster than select.operator i believe
[14:43:29] <DaOgre> ah ok, that makes a lot of sense
[14:43:36] <DaOgre> that's awesome, thanks so much for the help
[14:43:39] <Dave_Stein> np
[14:43:45] <Dave_Stein> needed a break from PHP
[14:43:49] <jirwin> haha
[14:44:35] <greedo> eddiemonge: yes I needed a no_html.text(). But it's blank?
[14:45:00] <DaOgre> yeah Im like all php all the time :)  I feel so clumsy with JS
[14:45:22] <Dave_Stein> over the last 4 years i went from 99% PHP to 99% JS but i just had to do a data migration script
[14:45:23] <Dave_Stein> fun fun
[14:46:17] <DaOgre> I hear ya, ok I'm going to go bang on this a bit more, thanks again for all the help Dave
[14:47:12] <SkyFlyer> question.  if I am doing a $(".item").clone();  how can i see if that item existed in the dom and was cloned?
[14:48:21] <necromancer> they have some similarities, DaOgre, but i feel as though JS is a bit more complicated
[14:48:27] <necromancer> because it's so different
[14:48:31] <eddiemonge> SkyFlyer: did you add the clone to the dom?
[14:51:14] <darcyclarke> SkyFlyer var clonedEl = $().clone()
[14:51:23] <darcyclarke> clonedEl.length >= 1
[14:51:45] <darcyclarke> SkyFlyer I'll even give you a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/v8zvg/
[14:52:38] <SkyFlyer> love your fiddle!  thanks
[14:52:47] <darcyclarke> SkyFlyer anytime bud
[14:53:02] <darcyclarke> assist by eddiemonge /cc SkyFlyer
[14:54:39] <eddiemonge> i taught darcyclarke eveything he knows
[14:55:39] <darcyclarke> eddiemonge o_O hmmm I believe that statement is falsy
[14:56:29] <greedo> is there a way to get data into a string?
[14:56:41] <eddiemonge> var str = data;
[14:56:55] <Axsuul> store it in a data-* attribute?
[14:57:53] <greedo> arg, then why does it not like str.text()
[14:58:45] <Axsuul> is str a jquery object?
[14:59:18] <eddiemonge> $(str).text()
[15:00:16] <greedo> yes
[15:00:23] <greedo> that works, thx
[15:06:05] <greedo> ok, I removed the html
[15:06:21] <greedo> but now I have a bunch of javascript still in the text
[15:15:15] <SkyFlyer> if I do a jquery for each loop inside my function how can I set a variable inside of it to be available in the rest of my main function?
[15:17:18] <bakers> SkyFlyer: Use a global variable?
[15:20:01] <ravenzz> or pass the variable to the function
[15:38:02] <SkyFlyer> question. when I do a clone() if there are more than one item, it clones all of them?  anyway to just select.. first..

[16:11:22] <Lann> if i declare a function (function($) { $.fn.tweet_list_generator = function (list, tweets, outro, s) { ... how can i call that function from a separate javascript file ?
[16:11:35] <Lann> i don't know jquery really
[16:11:55] <hooloovoo> Lann: well
[16:12:00] <Lann> i would have just made it a global function but it needs some jquery functionality
[16:12:08] <Lann> so i suppose i'm trying to make a global function within jquery
[16:12:12] <hooloovoo> you could prolly do $.tweet_list_generator()
[16:12:16] <Lann> oooh
[16:12:28] <Lann> i was trying $.fn.tweet_list_generator() and getting "funciton not defined"
[16:12:33] <hooloovoo> =)

[16:48:15] <e6nian> gnarf: are you here?
[16:49:19] <e6nian> gnarf: any advise about yesterday's bug
[16:59:35] <bonhoffer> i have jquery-ui.min.js jquery.js and jquery-ui.css available but my buttons still aren't styled -- any troubleshooting options?
[17:08:08] <eddiemonge> bonhoffer: in what order?
[17:08:27] <bonhoffer> i think i've got it -- the files are fine, but i'm missing the label tag
[17:12:40] <kba> Hi, I'm sure this is a very basic problem, but I downloaded jquery, jquery UI and the default theme "smoothess". Now, when I use my datepicker when the CSS is loaded, nothing shows up. If I use it without the CSS being loaded, a half-transparent window shows up. Any ideas what's wrong? All I do in my HTML is $(".datepick").datepicker();
[17:14:33] <Zisha> OK, I noticed something.
[17:15:01] <Zisha> slideUp will NOT slide properly if min-height is set.
[17:15:27] <Zisha> It seems so obvious now, but...at the same time that does sound like a bug.
[17:16:58] <eddiemonge> Zisha: it does slide up, stops at the min height and then hides the element
[17:17:17] <Zisha> Yep, should be noted on the api though.
[17:17:23] <Zisha> cause I could not figure that out.
[17:18:39] <greedo> yeah, free pizza
[17:18:55] <eddiemonge> Zisha: send me a message on twitter and ill add it
[17:19:12] <Zisha> eddiemonge: same name as IRC?
[17:20:33] <eddiemonge> yeah
[17:21:02] <eddiemonge> id do it now but im heading to a Microsoft sponsored open bar
[17:21:23] <Zisha> tweeted
[17:21:39] <greedo> open bar, nice
[17:22:14] <greedo> microsoft, not so nice :P
[17:27:05] <bikeshedder> Is there a way to stop jQuery to stop adding a _ to the URL when using $.getScript? I thought it would be handy to use it for loading scripts, but it trashes the cache. :-/
[17:28:10] <snover> bikeshedder: that is the point of that, yes.
[17:28:32] <snover> why are you using getScript?
[17:29:08] <bikeshedder> I'm loading a JS dependency on demand which already contains the version in the URL
[17:29:43] <bikeshedder> and besides if I want the cache to be disabled there are the official cache headers which browsers respect just fine.
[17:30:06] <bikeshedder> So the entire idea of adding a special timestamped get parameter is really hackish :-/
[17:32:36] <e6nian> gnarf: finally I got the bug!
[17:35:35] <coldhead> bikeshedder: it's not hackish, it stops people saying "OH JESUS WHY AM I NOT GETTING UPDATED DATA FROM THE SERVER"
[17:35:48] <coldhead> which would otherwise happen about every 30 seconds here
[17:39:10] <gnarf> e6nian: what was it?
[17:39:27] <bikeshedder> coldhead, ok, found it - the ajax call allows to set cache=False.
[17:43:31] <coldhead> bikeshedder: sorry, i assumed snover had already recommended that when he was asking why you were using getScript
[17:43:47] <coldhead> i'll take it up with him
[17:43:53] <snover> because I hate you coldhead
[17:44:10] <coldhead> i hope that's a euphemism
[17:47:58] <coldhead> DO YOU LIKE ME DO YOU LIKE ME DO YOU LIKE ME I GUESS
[17:48:17] <JesperA> i hate everyone
[17:52:00] <Scott0> is there a more efficient way to do this?
[17:52:07] <Scott0> $(this).jstree('open_node', $('.jstree-checked').parents('li.jstree-closed').get());
[17:56:49] <ProLoser|Work> i have a question about promise.done()
[17:57:05] <ProLoser|Work> if i have 4 async methods that all pass data
[17:57:16] <ProLoser|Work> can i have 1 done function that handles all 4 datas?
[17:57:26] <ProLoser|Work> like done(function(a, b, c, d){})
[17:57:55] <ProLoser|Work> if i did $.when(funa, funb, func, fund).done(fun(a,b,c,d))
[17:57:59] <ProLoser|Work> 'does that work??
[17:59:35] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: yes... that's more or less how it should work $.when( funa(), funb(), func(), fund() ).done( function(a, b, c, d) { });
[18:00:38] <acidjazz> when done?
[18:00:39] <acidjazz> wtf is that

[18:06:59] <futini> hello #jquery, if i select a checkbox, how i can the next checkbox?
[18:07:12] <futini> hiow i can select the next checkbox?
[18:07:12] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: so it will merge all the returns of the passed fn's into the first callback?
[18:07:23] <ajpiano> i think so
[18:07:37] <ajpiano> bbiab
[18:07:42] <JonahVT> Has anyone experienced an issue with jquery validator where entering a value in a number field type such as $4,000 causes the field value to disappear when you tab to the next field?
[18:08:42] <ProLoser|Work> i'm not sure it's working
[18:08:45] <ProLoser|Work> whatever i'll fix it later

[18:18:05] <Kiryaka> Hello there
[18:18:26] <Kiryaka> Having a fucking weird problem~
[18:18:32] <ryanneufeld> how do you namespace an event?
[18:18:44] <JonahVT> Actually - my problem is this. When I enter a dollar sign character into a number field, then tab, the field value is erased
[18:19:50] <Kiryaka> Loading either the latest jquery nor any other version, I can't use any selector : for example I just try to append something to the body using the following : $("body").append("something"); => nothing happens
[18:19:50] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @Kiryaka
[18:19:51] <bot-t> Kiryaka, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:20:06] <ryanneufeld> ?p A Kiryaka
[18:20:07] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:20:47] <JonahVT> Quick question: I'm using jQuery validator and have a "number" field. When I enter a dollar sign in the value, then tab, the value is erased. Any ideas?
[18:21:10] <JonahVT> It should just strip out the dollar sign character like it does with commas, I would think
[18:22:04] <futini> http://jsfiddle.net/PSaXg/1/ help please :)
[18:22:17] <Kiryaka> ryanneufeld: problem found... just a fucking stupid mistake, 2am here
[18:22:30] <Kiryaka> was putting my fucking script in the <head>
[18:22:32] <Kiryaka> thanks anyway
[18:22:48] <JonahVT> Glad you figured it out Kiryaka :)
[18:23:02] <ryanneufeld> futini: what is your question?
[18:23:15] <futini> i cant select the next checkbox
[18:23:28] <futini> i select a checkbox, but i dont know how select the next.
[18:24:06] <futini> i need select only the next checkbox when the user select a checkbox, this is my code http://jsfiddle.net/PSaXg/1/
[18:24:07] <ryanneufeld> futini: $(this).next('input[type=checkbox]'); should do it
[18:24:09] <JonahVT> $(this).next('input[type=checkbox]'); I believe
[18:24:11] <JonahVT> yep :)
[18:24:19] <futini> thanks, i will try! :D
[18:24:20] <ryanneufeld> JonahVT: JYNX!!
[18:24:24] <JonahVT> hehe
[18:24:31] <ryanneufeld> futini: that will only work on the click of the first one
[18:25:07] <JonahVT> ryan: Any thoughts on my validator dollar sign issue?
[18:25:18] <JonahVT> It is probably just a regex issue
[18:25:22] <JonahVT> just not sure where it's coming from
[18:25:35] <ryanneufeld> $ is a special char for regexp
[18:25:39] <JonahVT> yeah
[18:25:43] <ryanneufeld> so I'm not sure how you'd deal with that
[18:25:46] <JonahVT> \$
[18:25:49] <JonahVT> I think?
[18:25:52] <ryanneufeld> yeah,
[18:25:52] <JonahVT> just escape it
[18:26:00] <ryanneufeld> that's what I would think
[18:26:26] <JonahVT> I think the pattern it is currently using to validate is:  (^$)|^[\d]+$
[18:26:48] <JonahVT> But I'm not sure why the field value would be erased
[18:26:53] <JonahVT> it should just throw an error that it's not valid
[18:27:18] <subsume> Can someone pleaase help me explain this chrome console error -> http://dpaste.com/645816/
[18:27:21] <JonahVT> If there is already a value in the field that is good, then you overwrite with an invalid value, it reverts to the valid one
[18:27:22] <ryanneufeld> (^$) is an empty string
[18:27:40] <JonahVT> Hmm
[18:27:43] <ryanneufeld> JonahVT: http://gskinner.com/RegExr/
[18:28:21] <JonahVT> sweet, thanks for the link Ryan
[18:28:27] <JonahVT> will fiddle with that :)
[18:28:48] <JonahVT> subsume: Are you accessing the second page with a relative url or full url?
[18:28:52] <ryanneufeld> subsume: paste the actual error your getting, i'm certain you don't own domain.net
[18:30:33] <ryanneufeld> JonahVT: yeah I use that whenever I need to test a regexp
[18:30:36] <ryanneufeld> very useful
[18:32:16] <Scott0> JonahVT: have you realized this wont work for him?  $(this).next('input[type=checkbox]');
[18:32:30] <Scott0> JonahVT: the next element isnt an input
[18:33:36] <JonahVT> Isn't there a situation where the next element could be an input?
[18:34:03] <Scott0> nextAll works better
[18:34:24] <Scott0> JonahVT: yes but his jsfiddle seems to have a <br> in between
[18:34:25] <JonahVT> Good thinking
[18:34:32] <JonahVT> I didn't see that he posted a jsfiddle
[18:34:33] <Scott0> too bad he left
[18:34:39] <JonahVT> just that he wanted to know how to select the next checkbox
[18:35:20] <Scott0> in case he comes back  http://jsfiddle.net/PSaXg/3/
[18:35:31] <JonahVT> cool
[18:39:04] <ryanneufeld> how would I access the jQuery instance within an iframe? It's on the same domain
[18:40:28] <coldhead> parent.window.jQuery ?
[18:40:40] <ryanneufeld> That works within the iframe
[18:40:48] <ryanneufeld> I need it from outside the iframe in
[18:40:54] <ryanneufeld> contents lets me gain access to the DOM
[18:41:01] <miketaylr> window.frames[0].contentWindow.jQuery?
[18:41:11] <ryanneufeld> but I need to do some binding/unbinding
[18:41:25] <coldhead> how about you don't use iframes and shutup
[18:41:33] <coldhead> that fixed it for me
[18:41:46] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: how about that is not an option, unless I quit my job
[18:41:52] <coldhead> OH SO NOW I'M BEING UNHELPFUL
[18:42:05] <coldhead> WELL THAT'S GRATITUDE FOR YOU
[18:42:12] <coldhead> TAKE YOURSELF TO THE FUCKING CIRCUS, RYRY
[18:42:18] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[18:42:21] <ryanneufeld> miketaylr: thanks, that was the ticket
[18:42:29] <miketaylr> circus ticket?
[18:42:32] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: but I was gonna buy to cotton candy
[18:42:36] <danzik17> coldhead: for the record, i read that with the voice of sterling archer in my head.
[18:42:38] <coldhead> MIKE CAN TAKE YOU
[18:42:51] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: don't be like that...
[18:43:05] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: I'll get you the jumbo wiener you like so much
[18:44:29] <miketaylr> mmm hotdogs
[18:44:57] <thebigkiwi> hi, i've got an expanding div working in all browsers except for firefox, when I click on the HTML link, it takes me to the base href, not the "#" link it should - http://www.eliteresortsofasiapacific.com/home
[18:45:09] <thebigkiwi> sorry, link - http://www.eliteresortsofasiapacific.com/elite-episodes/elite-celebrations-2012
[18:45:40] <ryanneufeld> fuck I hate dealing with ads all the fucking time
[18:45:55] <ryanneufeld> the authors of the fucking JS code need to be kicked in the fucking head
[18:46:30] <ryanneufeld> thebigkiwi: are you doing a event.stopPropagation or return false in your click handler?
[18:47:24] <thebigkiwi> ryanneufeld: https://gist.github.com/0eacea6ee6d4bab7d8ee
[18:47:42] <ryanneufeld> so no
[18:47:52] <ryanneufeld> return false; at the end of that
[18:48:05] <ryanneufeld> also, if you can, we've found that using onclick='' is better
[18:48:09] <ryanneufeld> more accurate results
[18:48:26] <ryanneufeld> also, you should use the async google analytics tags
[18:48:27] <thebigkiwi> thanks ryanneufeld, im not really a developer so changing all of that might be a problem
[18:48:39] <ryanneufeld> find one, and make them do it
[18:49:14] <thebigkiwi> yeah, our dev has been awol for a month or so, frustrating playing with the code myself
[18:49:30] <ryanneufeld> awol? or on leave?
[18:49:51] <thebigkiwi> not respoding to anything
[18:50:14] <thebigkiwi> tried the return false, still nothing
[18:51:19] <thebigkiwi> ryanneufeld: https://gist.github.com/08f04e187ac959da9f01
[18:53:58] <ryanneufeld> replace $('#elite-episodes-single-episode a') with $('#elite-episodes-single-episode').find('a')
[18:54:11] <thebigkiwi> thanks
[18:54:22] <ryanneufeld> try that
[18:54:25] <ryanneufeld> see if it worls
[18:54:28] <ryanneufeld> *works
[18:58:48] <thebigkiwi> hrm, no luck
[18:59:03] <iPaintCode> hey big what are you trying to do?
[18:59:31] <thebigkiwi> expanding content in firefox, ive set the ahref as #, but when i click on anything, it takes me to my base href
[19:00:19] <iPaintCode> Can you pastie some code sample?
[19:01:30] <thebigkiwi> iPaintCode: sure - https://gist.github.com/08f04e187ac959da9f01

[19:05:05] <thebigkiwi> thanks, will try that

[19:06:08] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: have we met in person?
[19:06:21] <ryanneufeld> maybe
[19:06:34] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: I was at a jQuery con in SF this year
[19:06:47] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: A/S/L (well L mostly)
[19:07:05] <thebigkiwi> how can i set a log in firebug, sorry!
[19:07:18] <ryanneufeld> console.log
[19:07:30] <iPaintCode> enable console in firebug
[19:08:16] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: why do you ask?
[19:08:41] <iPaintCode> click the down arrow next to console and check enabled*
[19:09:07] <thebigkiwi> yep, its enabled, click on the link then it disappears
[19:09:15] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: you look familiar
[19:09:28] <eddiemonge> so we possibly met in april
[19:09:29] <ryanneufeld> based on what image?

[19:10:32] <thebigkiwi> yeah, this is my code - https://gist.github.com/b3c6488dfdb1713f1d0d

[19:10:48] <ryanneufeld> is me
[19:11:48] <eddiemonge> but theres no picture
[19:11:53] <ryanneufeld> :P
[19:12:14] <thebigkiwi> the only error i get is - pageTracker._trackEvent is not a function
[19:12:28] <ryanneufeld> thebigkiwi: then there you go
[19:12:35] <ryanneufeld> pageTracker is the google analytics
[19:12:48] <ryanneufeld> and it probably means that you're not using the old style one
[19:12:51] <thebigkiwi> but don't i need that to track it as an event
[19:13:11] <ryanneufeld> then why are you binding to to a click on that?
[19:13:17] <ryanneufeld> and call ing pageTracker?
[19:13:32] <thebigkiwi> i want to know when someone clicks on my expending content
[19:13:39] <thebigkiwi> to be tracked as an event
[19:13:42] <iPaintCode> @thebigkiwi http://pastie.org/2796720
[19:13:43] <ryanneufeld> right
[19:14:02] <ryanneufeld> you just said you don't want it to track
[19:14:05] <iPaintCode> opps my bad*
[19:14:09] <thebigkiwi> well not me, but my client and CEO's want to track it
[19:14:24] <ryanneufeld> thebigkiwi: you're killing me here
[19:14:29] <ryanneufeld> do you have this code live?
[19:14:37] <thebigkiwi> yeah - http://www.eliteresortsofasiapacific.com/elite-episodes/elite-celebrations-2012
[19:14:37] <eddiemonge> thebigkiwi: in your click event, do console.log( pageTracker ); and see if that is even available
[19:15:00] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: I don't have an avatar on github cause I don't want get a gravatar account. I shouldn't need a whole account just for a fucking avatar
[19:15:25] <sgronblo> Is it possible to prevent chrome from stopping on breakpoints inside of jquery, for example the xhr and event listener breakpoints.
[19:15:27] <eddiemonge> oh is that where github gets it from? didnt realize that
[19:15:42] <eddiemonge> sgronblo: did you set the breakpoints?
[19:16:06] <ryanneufeld> thebigkiwi: where did you get the pagetracker code from?
[19:16:06] <sgronblo> It's not very useful when the execution stops there, especially with minified jquery
[19:16:24] <thebigkiwi> ryanneufeld: not sure, my developer implimented it
[19:16:26] <sgronblo> eddiemonge: uh yeah, how do you mean?
[19:16:29] <ryanneufeld> thebigkiwi: k
[19:16:32] <ryanneufeld> he did it wrong
[19:16:43] <eddiemonge> sgronblo: breakpoints only exist when you manually add them to the console
[19:16:47] <thebigkiwi> right, thats frustrating
[19:16:53] <ryanneufeld> thebigkiwi: http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/asyncTracking.html
[19:16:55] <ryanneufeld> start there
[19:16:57] <ryanneufeld> learn
[19:17:04] <ajpiano> sgronblo: so turn off xhr and event listener breakpoints?
[19:17:18] <ajpiano> if you're using jquery for xhr and event listeneres, that's where those breakpoints are gonna fire
[19:17:22] <sgronblo> ajpiano: but im trying to figure out which function a click eventually goes to
[19:17:35] <ajpiano> sgronblo: so filter it to clicks and then use the call stack when it pauses
[19:17:59] <sgronblo> ajpiano: yeah but there could be some feature that lets execution proceed until it gets out of jquery
[19:18:01] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: he's talking about the special automatic breakpoints http://gyazo.com/5801d7af45e7e8ab4cba2ef252daeba0
[19:18:14] <ajpiano> sgronblo: i think that's a bit too magical :)
[19:18:31] <sgronblo> seems like it would be a pretty plain thing to do
[19:18:41] <sgronblo> ajpiano: but won't i be on the bottom of the stack before the application code gets called
[19:19:01] <ajpiano> how could it be done at a browser level?
[19:19:03] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: thanks, now i want pizza.
[19:19:12] <ryanneufeld> thebigkiwi: you need to have _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Elite Episodes', 'Click', $(this).attr('title')]);
[19:19:18] <ajpiano> "if the event is being handled by a javascript library, put the breakpoint somwehere else?"
[19:19:19] <sgronblo> so i cant go up the stack yet because the app code isnt there yet, no?
[19:19:28] <ajpiano> sgronblo: what
[19:19:40] <thebigkiwi> ryanneufeld: instead of the pagetracker_ ?
[19:19:54] <ryanneufeld> replace that whole line
[19:20:00] <ajpiano> sgronblo: if you bind a click handler with jquery, and then the click handler fires and you end up on an event listener breakpoint inside of jquery, the call stack will take you back up to the code that invoked it
[19:20:23] <thebigkiwi> ryanneufeld:  and i don't need to bind the click, the find 'a' will be fine?
[19:20:33] <ryanneufeld> thebigkiwi: http://jsfiddle.net/HuDgY/1/
[19:20:47] <ajpiano> oh woah...
[19:20:49] <ajpiano> i might be wrong
[19:20:51] <ajpiano>  :/
[19:20:53] <ryanneufeld> the line I commented out, is the old way. the one under it is the new way
[19:20:54] <sgronblo> ajpiano: no my call stack only seems to have one level when the click breakpoint stops execution
[19:20:56] <ryanneufeld> I have to run though
[19:20:58] <ryanneufeld> good luck
[19:21:00] <ajpiano> sgronblo: yeah mine too
[19:21:26] <sgronblo> ajpiano: its f.event.add.i.handle.k in jquerymin
[19:21:27] <ajpiano> that's a bummer
[19:21:29] <ajpiano> yep
[19:21:31] <sgronblo> ajpiano: told ya
[19:21:45] <sgronblo> the clicks go though jquery
[19:21:59] <thebigkiwi> that works thanks ryanneufekd
[19:22:02] <sgronblo> thats why you want to manually flag the jquery file as dont stop on breakpoints here
[19:22:16] <thebigkiwi> ryanneufeld: thanks
[19:22:19] <ajpiano> i don't believe that functionality exists sgronblo
[19:24:17] <sgronblo> ajpiano: thats why im screwed. iow have to start asking my coworkers.
[19:26:44] <thebigkiwi> iPaintCode: ryanneufeld: thanks so much guys!
[19:26:57] <iPaintCode> ryan did all the heavy lifting :P
[19:27:04] <thebigkiwi> it's tracking in Analytics too
[19:27:21] <iateadonut> $(this).next().next() is finding <input> where $this is <span> and it goes <span></span><br /><input></input> but $(this).next('input') is not finding that input.
[19:27:29] <thebigkiwi> he mentioned I switch to async google analytics
[19:27:34] <danzik17> sgronblo: you just need to know what handler it is?
[19:27:57] <sgronblo> danzik17: yeah
[19:28:03] <eddiemonge> iateadonut: thats because the next element is a br
[19:28:10] <danzik17> sgronblo: what kind of event and is it dependant on other events?
[19:28:21] <danzik17> and how many handlers are we talking about
[19:28:24] <sgronblo> its a click
[19:28:29] <eddiemonge> when you use a selector with next, it checks the next element and if it matches that element then it returns it, if not it returns nothing
[19:28:38] <iateadonut> how do i make next find the next input?
[19:28:38] <sgronblo> just one i think
[19:28:44] <eddiemonge> ?nextuntil @ iateadonut
[19:28:45] <bot-t> iateadonut, .nextUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[19:28:49] <sgronblo> so i can figure out where to start looking
[19:28:53] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: btw i created see ?next2
[19:28:53] <bot-t> eddiemonge, .next("selector") is not "magically find the next element anywhere in the DOM that matches the selector". .next() looks at an element's next immediate sibling and then filters it by the selector. You might want to try .nextAll("selector").first(). (Note: .prev and .prevAll work the same way)
[19:28:57] <danzik17> wait if you have just one, how do you not know what function?
[19:29:05] <danzik17> or do you mean you're looking for one, but may have more than one bound
[19:29:30] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: oh nice. i miss bot-t.com
[19:29:40] <ajpiano> yeah
[19:30:12] <danzik17> sgronblo: either way = just use $( selector ).data( 'events' ) so see bound handlers .  it's considered internal to jquery so don't go using it on production code, but for debugging have a ball
[19:31:15] <sgronblo> danzik17: does that work even with event delegation?
[19:31:37] <sgronblo> danzik17: i mean you can already check event handlers in chromes "dev tab"
[19:32:22] <danzik17> well, you'll need to know what element has the delegated event, but yes.
[19:32:42] <sgronblo> danzik17: well thats the thing im trying to figure out
[19:32:53] <sgronblo> where is my click eventually handled
[19:33:37] <danzik17> sgronblo:  can't you just do $( 'selector').parents().each( function() { console.log( $(this).data('events') ); })
[19:33:56] <danzik17> i can't imagine you're so deeply nested that itd take any significant amount of time to just look thru those results
[19:34:09] <sgronblo> danzik17: ok that looks like it could do the trick
[19:34:48] <sgronblo> but it would be nicest if you could just prevent execution from stopping inside certain files and just enable the click breakpoint
[19:36:03] <sgronblo> Is it possible to get a reference to an element in the console from the element explorer (chrome)
[19:36:48] <danzik17> not that i know of.
[19:36:53] <ajpiano> yes there is
[19:37:03] <ajpiano> sgronblo: once you select the elemtn
[19:37:06] <ajpiano> in the element explorer
[19:37:15] <ajpiano> the value $0 in the console will refer to that element
[19:37:29] <sgronblo> ajpiano: omg!!!
[19:37:33] <sgronblo> so cool
[19:37:33] <danzik17> ajpiano: holy crap.
[19:37:42] <ajpiano> ;)
[19:37:48] <danzik17> ajpiano: you sir just saved my future self craploads of time.
[19:38:00] <sgronblo> mind.blown = true;
[19:43:08] <sgronblo> danzik17: your snippet seems to print the actual elements and not events though
[19:43:22] <sgronblo> ah no
[19:43:31] <sgronblo> i was looking at the return value i think
[19:43:51] <sgronblo> it seemed to print undefined all the way up to the top
[19:45:27] <danzik17> check $( document ).data( 'events' ) - don't think that's included in .parents() and a lot of delegation is done there.  might be a bunch since that's the top level though.
[19:45:50] <sgronblo> ah hope thats not the case
[19:52:50] <amh345> how can i call a serverside file with an .click event on an id?
[20:09:58] <lolgolflol926> Good Moring
[20:11:17] <lolgolflol926> Who know about pluing jquery , i would like mask up password in text field same mask passowrd on ios
[20:12:19] <lolgolflol926> example. when I type "4" in text field ,A minute it change from 4 to *
[20:27:19] <coldhead> lolgolflol926: did you try google?
[20:27:26] <coldhead> i found this very easily: http://www.jquery4u.com/mobile/10-jquery-iphone-style-plugins/
[20:27:39] <coldhead> the very first entry there seems to do what you want
[20:30:53] <IanWizard-Cloud> Ahh, long time no query...
[20:32:02] <amh345> i have a link mypage/2   how can i make that link load in a div?   i dont have the luxury of using a data-remote attribute, so i need to do it manually.
[20:32:57] <IanWizard-Cloud> amh345: $.ajax(<read docs for details>, function(data) {
[20:33:12] <IanWizard-Cloud> $('#my_div').html(data); });
[20:33:30] <coldhead> ?ajax.load
[20:33:31] <bot-t> coldhead, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:34:06] <IanWizard-Cloud> Ahh, that's nice.
[20:34:13] <amh345> oh, i was trying .get, but it wasnt passing the id in the url
[20:34:20] <amh345> .load solves that kind of issue?
[20:34:22] * IanWizard-Cloud should keep up with the current jquery better :P
[20:34:49] <lolgolflol926> coldhead : thany you very much.
[20:35:07] <amh345> alright, from the docs. $('#result').load('ajax/test.html');   no id is passed
[20:35:23] <IanWizard-Cloud> Is there a way to select an <option> within a <select>, with jQuery ?
[20:36:25] <coldhead> $('select option') ?
[20:36:42] <IanWizard-Cloud> coldhead: no, actually select it.
[20:37:31] <IanWizard-Cloud> coldhead: something like .selectedIndex, but jQuery-afied.
[20:38:15] <coldhead> ?:selected
[20:38:16] <bot-t> :selected: Selects all elements that are selected. http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[20:39:50] <IanWizard-Cloud> coldhead: I'd like to use .click(), or .val(), but neither seems to work.
[20:41:03] <coldhead> can you put your code on jsfiddle so someone can take a look?
[20:41:46] <IanWizard-Cloud> coldhead: I have no code pertaining to it, it would be something like:  $('select option').eq[0].click()
[20:42:18] <coldhead> $('select option').eq(0).click()
[20:42:48] <ajpiano> that's not how to select an option in a select...
[20:43:01] <ajpiano> $("#foo").val("valueOfOptionYouWantToSelect")
[20:43:11] <IanWizard-Cloud> coldhead: I have a select, with three <option>s in it.  Say <option> #2 is selected, and I want to make #1 be selected...   There's the rub
[20:43:31] <IanWizard-Cloud> ajpiano: I believe that that didn't work.
[20:43:36] <IanWizard-Cloud> ajpiano: I can try again.
[20:43:41] <ajpiano> IanWizard-Cloud: if you want to do index-based stuff, selectedIndex is your best bet
[20:47:07] <IanWizard-Cloud> ajpiano: thanks, I guess i'll have to just do that :)
[20:47:09] <IanWizard-Cloud> Thanks.
[20:54:30] <coldhead> what a nice man
[21:28:07] <luchenbill> is there any really lightweight jquery validation classes?
[21:40:55] <SIMBunch> hi. i have a div (which is essentially a chatbox) that updates itself with text. is it possible to attach an event to check when new text arrives?
[21:41:21] <sgrover> I'm creating a plugin that may need to include other libraries.  Is there anyway to determine the directory the current library is located at? (assuming the other libraries are in the same directory....
[21:42:27] <coldhead> if you can find the <script> tag that's including your script you could inspect the src attribute
[21:43:14] <sgrover> hmm.. I could try that... thanks for the tip.
[21:44:38] <SIMBunch> hi. i have a div (which is essentially a chatbox) that updates itself with text. is it possible to attach an event to check when new text arrives?
[21:44:51] <SIMBunch> something like change() but for divs
[21:45:14] <coldhead> no, SIMBunch
[21:45:24] <SIMBunch> ok
[21:45:27] <sgrover> SIMBunch: short answer - yes - I think.  longer answer - I don't know how offhand
[21:45:33] <coldhead> the best way to do it at present is to use custom events
[21:45:43] <sgrover> Look into the custom events...
[21:45:52] <SIMBunch> ok thanks
[21:45:53] <sgrover> er.. coldhead and I are moving in the same direction... :)
[21:46:02] <coldhead> $('#chatbox').bind('freshchat', function () {...});
[21:46:20] <coldhead> and then do $('#chatbox').trigger('freshchat') whenever you add new stuff
[21:46:49] <coldhead> if you're really lazy you can fire that event whenever new ajax content loads
[21:46:53] <coldhead> that's how i roll
[21:47:01] <SIMBunch> the new stuff is added by oher people, not me
[21:47:12] <coldhead> yeah, that's a bummer
[21:47:20] <coldhead> but the ajax option could work in that cast
[21:47:21] <coldhead> case*
[21:47:35] <SIMBunch> unfortunately i have no control over any aspect
[21:47:43] <SIMBunch> all i can is to check if new text is added into the div
[21:47:53] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[21:47:57] <coldhead> you can bind to them
[21:48:05] <coldhead> and add your custom event firing
[21:48:14] <coldhead> regardless of what your other authors are doing
[21:48:34] <SIMBunch> ooh nice
[21:52:49] <SIMBunch> document.ajaxComplete doesn't return anything
[21:59:20] <SerpentX> hello?
[22:00:13] <SerpentX> anyone good with jquery dialog boxes and google appe ngine?
[22:03:29] <SIMBunch> coldhead and sgrover there actually *is* a way to detect mutation events
[22:03:30] <SIMBunch> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/mutation-events-12-1-2010
[22:03:33] <SIMBunch> :)
[22:03:42] <SIMBunch> works beautifully
[22:04:01] <coldhead> it doesn't work cross browser
[22:15:08] <amh345> im hiding a #flash_container. and then on a .click i .show() it.  directly after that i run a function that plays the flash video.   i seem to have a problem where the video attempts to play before the div is shown.  is there a way to ensure .show() has been completed before i run a function?
[22:17:32] <amh345> here is a pastie. http://pastie.org/private/rgljc7dh787tgphxnjxsqq    the alert seems to allow .show() to function properly in FF.  but in chrome it does nothing.   ultimately i need to figure out how to ensure it's loaded before the function runs.
[22:24:21] <futini> http://jsfiddle.net/NUgSV/16/ help please :)

[22:45:24] <H4CK3R> hello guys
[22:46:16] <coldhead> WOAH WE GOT A H4CK3R IN HERE
[22:46:23] <coldhead> I'M FREAKING OUT
[22:46:25] <nickelnick> watch out
[22:46:26] <H4CK3R> ;)
[22:46:28] * wookiehangover and at least be rid of the super obvious and duplicates
[22:46:34] <wookiehangover> whoops
[22:46:51] <wookiehangover> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39CRw7zH_2A
[22:46:56] <H4CK3R> its my nickname guys
[22:46:56] <wookiehangover> POINT ATTACK!!
[22:49:00] <coldhead> what was all that duplicates business
[22:49:12] <coldhead> i wil always wonder
[22:49:16] <coldhead> lonely as a cloud
[22:51:29] <H4CK3R> bye guys
[22:59:48] <amh345> any ideas on this?  http://pastie.org/private/rgljc7dh787tgphxnjxsqq   i need to ensure that line 5 has loaded before line 6 is executed.
[23:01:26] <luchenbill> how can I use ajax to query a db to check and see if an email address is already in a database?
[23:01:47] <coldhead> amh345: http://pastie.org/private/d6mtcn7navqpjda09fl2kg
[23:06:59] <coldhead> luchenbill: do you have a URL on the server which returns true or false for a given email address?
[23:07:04] <coldhead> if not, do that first
[23:08:41] <amh345> coldhead: thanks.   i tried it an unfortunately it still looks to not the play() function before the show() is ready.  for some reason alert() gives it enough time. so i popup the alert and by the time i click it the div is ready.
[23:11:01] <luchenbill> coldhead huh?
[23:11:46] <coldhead> sorry i thought you were asking something else
[23:11:50] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[23:12:17] <coldhead> ?mdc settimeout @ amh345
[23:12:18] <bot-t> amh345, window.setTimeout - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[23:12:24] <coldhead> give it 500 milliseconds or something
[23:13:00] <amh345> the thing that concerns me is that it happens in chrome as well.
[23:13:04] <amh345> havent even tried IE
[23:14:16] <coldhead> the thing that concerns me is that i'll never find true love
[23:15:31] <amh345> that's a problem for most of the ppulation.  unless you're good at lying to yourself.  or unless you believe in true love.   i woudlnt sweat it.
[23:16:11] <snover> i loved you coldhead but you broke my heart
[23:16:11] <bot-t> (2 hours 12 mins ago) <JonathanNeal> tell snover https://gist.github.com/1332824
[23:16:35] <SIMBunch> <div> <span>hello</span> <a>world</a> foobar </div> <-- how do i just get "foobar"?
[23:17:07] <SIMBunch> $(div).html() gets the entire thing inside
[23:17:45] <SIMBunch> is there a way to perhaps strip away all the elements and leave the text?
[23:18:47] <coldhead> $('div').find('*').remove().text()
[23:18:55] <coldhead> you might like to do that on a clone() though
[23:20:01] <snover> $('#coldhead').find('heart').remove()
[23:20:01] <SIMBunch> sweet
[23:21:58] <amh345> coldhead: is delay() a suitable substitute for timeout?
[23:22:04] <coldhead> god no
[23:22:35] <coldhead> it's suitable if one of your critieria is that it doesn't work
[23:22:45] <coldhead> otherwise just use setTimeout
[23:22:48] <coldhead> don't be scared
[23:22:55] <coldhead> LIKE A CORKSCREW TO MY HEART
[23:23:09] <coldhead> you're making me listen to awkward bob dylan, snover
[23:23:13] <coldhead> i hope you're happy
[23:25:43] <coldhead> bye, fatguylaughing
[23:25:55] <amh345> this look about right?   doesnt appear to make a lick of difference. setTimeout (Play2(),4000);     http://pastie.org/private/q4i9voj4ltwuuselkjnf6w
[23:27:56] <coldhead> lose the () after Play2
[23:28:11] <coldhead> and make sure you understand the difference
[23:32:02] <amh345> still not doing it.  im going to post over at stackoverflow. maybe someone has experience with this specific jquery/flash sync thing
[23:32:31] <coldhead> good luck
[23:33:07] <amh345> why the hell alert makes it work- i dont know. i set the time out to a few seconds and it still wouldnt fly.
[23:33:54] <coldhead> what a bitter mystery
[23:34:28] <amh345> i see why you're called coldhead
[23:34:44] <amh345> i thought it was a penis reference at first ;)
[23:34:51] <coldhead> gross
[23:40:29] <manixor> Hello guys. How can I dynamically read all files name inside a directory?
[23:41:27] <coldhead> snover: you got this one?
[23:41:38] <snover> coldhead: if you insist
[23:41:50] <coldhead> it's your kinda thing
[23:42:33] <snover> manixor: jQuery canâ€™t do that for you.
[23:45:25] <manixor> snover: Do you have any idea how can dynamically fill a div with img tags from a directory? I want to just copy new jpg files inside a directory, and on my website to have all them inside a div.
[23:46:13] <snover> maybe.
[23:48:22] <yamahaalex> is there a really lightweight button decoration i can use
[23:48:25] <yamahaalex> like jquery ui
[23:48:30] <yamahaalex> but i only need one button on my entire site decorated
[23:49:25] <luite> manixor: if your server serves a directory index with href links to all images, just get that with ajax, select all a elements and add their hrefs as images
[23:50:07] <yamahaalex> is there a google button decoration like google fonts
[23:59:31] <yamahaalex> if i want to apply a cool button style, do i need jqueryui or a css file
[23:59:57] <puppen> yamahaalex: If you're only styling one, perhaps JS would be a bit much overhead..
