[00:13:51] <jnz> Hey
[00:14:24] <muzammilr> need help with datatable http://fiddle.jshell.net/w6Hnj/ I an trying to create a nested datatables. I get to see the table only after I click on first + and then + icon on next column.
[00:36:04] <fizzle> http://xniz-solutions.comuf.com/  :D got the slideshow to 30% functionality
[00:39:46] <soee> can i at the same time toggle 2 classes ? one remove one add ?
[00:40:53] <TuomasL> soee why not just have toggleClass('class').toggleClas('class2')
[00:41:01] <TuomasL> add an s in there :P
[00:41:21] <TuomasL> if it doesn't have a class it adds, if it has it removes
[00:42:37] <soee> TuomasL: thanks
[00:42:43] <TuomasL> nps
[00:46:33] <muzammilr> http://fiddle.jshell.net/w6Hnj/ I an trying to create a nested datatables. I get to see the table only after I click on first + and then + icon on next column.
[00:48:26] <TuomasL> muzammilr didn't quite understand
[00:49:46] <muzammilr> i want a datatable to show up when the + is clicked, if does not show up in the first row until i click on the next rows +
[00:50:56] <muzammilr> TuomasL: click on the + on the first row and then click on + on the second row, you will see what i am trying to explain (I am very bad with words)
[00:51:21] <TuomasL> ah
[00:51:51] <muzammilr> not sure how to get it on the first click
[00:56:10] <muzammilr> TuomasL: i have to head out a few min, if you get it work i will be greatly thankful
[00:56:23] <TuomasL> k
[01:04:04] <vinex08> hey does game dvt here?
[01:10:46] <marcules> Morning
[01:14:37] <krambiorix> hi, i have a phone number 0422343546  and i want to format it like 0422/34 3546  -> how can i do that?
[01:14:54] <krambiorix> ooops  , i mean , format like  0422/34 35 46
[01:16:43] <marcules> krambiorix, I don't know if there is an easier way (there probably is) - but you could have your input-field with opacity zero above a div, which you can format all you like with a listener to onKeyup or onChange on the input field
[01:17:26] <krambiorix> marcules, thanks, but how can i format it like that
[01:18:59] <marcules> With String.replace() and a regex I'd guess - or you could split the string into substrings and have a fixed association of char-array-to-display-div
[01:19:06] <marcules> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2254185/regular-expression-for-formatting-numbers-in-javascript
[01:22:00] <marcules> krambiorix, is the number after the area code fixed in size - or like in Germany arbitrary long?
[01:23:43] <xec> if they are always 8 characters you could do it the easy way
[01:23:49] <xec> "0422343546".replace(/^(\d{4})(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})/, "$1/$2 $3 $4")
[01:24:02] <marcules> I suspect they are arbitrarily long
[01:24:29] <marcules> Is there some kind of regex magic which lets you get "the remainder of your capturing groups" on a replace?
[01:25:12] <marcules> So you could (\d{4})(\d{2})* and then replace with $1 / ...remainder separated by space...
[01:25:58] <xec> well you could use the end constraint and ignore whatever it starts with
[01:26:10] <xec> "01231422343546".replace(/(\d{4})(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})$/, "$1/$2 $3 $4") => "01231422/34 35 46"
[01:26:33] <xec> meaning it wouldnt match a group and hence not be replaced
[01:26:49] <marcules> Usually the first numbers are a (fixed size) area code and the remainder is arbitrary - but I don't know where he's from, so just speculation :D
[01:27:26] <xec> well my first approach would do that
[01:27:50] <marcules> Woudn't you need to know how long the remaining numbers are?
[01:28:12] <xec> no
[01:28:49] <xec> unless they are shorter than 8
[01:28:53] <krambiorix> marcules, xec hmmm , the first numbers can be of length 2 or 3 :s
[01:29:16] <krambiorix> but when it's 2 then the first other 6 numbers would be XXX XX XX
[01:29:27] <xec> lol
[01:29:30] <krambiorix> yeah
[01:30:18] <krambiorix> if it starts with "02", "03", "04", "09"   -> XXX XX XX
[01:30:41] <krambiorix> i will use an if else :D
[01:30:53] <marcules> Wait
[01:31:16] <marcules> whats the rule? if it starts with 04 then the first group is 0422 (so 4 chars)?
[01:31:29] <xec> no 3 i take it
[01:31:36] <xec> "XXX XX XX"
[01:31:38] <marcules> So his example above was moot?
[01:32:13] <xec> no thats for a length of 10
[01:32:22] <xec> not 7 xD
[01:32:23] <xec> i guess
[01:32:54] <xec> anyway i give up. krambiorix: if you want a proper solution make a demo with all the different cases and what they should result in
[01:34:11] <krambiorix> if it starts with  "02" or  "03" or "04",or "09" it should be eg. 02/XXX XX XX   if not, eg 056 it should be 056/45 34 34
[01:39:30] <krambiorix> marcules, xec ok it works , thanks a lot!!!
[01:39:35] <xec> so now it's 9 characters?
[01:42:13] <krambiorix> 9 or 8, xec
[01:51:23] <xec> but your first example was 10 :P
[01:59:00] <skullcrasher> i started writing a plugin with jquery-boilerplate
[01:59:26] <skullcrasher> now I would like to know, how do i use often used elements?
[01:59:27] <skullcrasher> http://jsfiddle.net/jsdLq/
[01:59:35] <skullcrasher> save as attributes of the plugin?
[02:00:03] <skullcrasher> like save buttons or similar
[02:00:17] <seutje> sure
[02:01:10] <skullcrasher> ok
[02:07:31] <marcules> krambiorix, I wanted to suggest you string.match() but I got distracted
[02:09:24] <krambiorix> marlol
[02:09:40] <krambiorix> xec yeah, that was a mobile number
[02:14:34] <marcules> The system is worse here - there are no constraints on length of neither area code nor actual phone number
[02:32:13] <marcules> krambiorix, https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/ << maybe that's more robust
[02:32:31] <SprkDev> It says my optionsFloating.offset is undefined. What dependents scripts could be missing?
[02:43:01] <SprkDev> I get 301 Moved Permanently error. And jqeruy script aint loading properly. Why?
[02:51:04] <Cork> SprkDev: where are you loading it from?
[02:55:41] <SprkDev> I'm loading the script from my filepath on disk. Dunno why I get 301.
[02:57:04] <Cork> so your loading from file://?
[02:57:19] <skullcrasher> can anybody tell my how i can call plugin functions like .plugin('function',arguments) with jquery-boilerplate?
[02:57:44] <ahandy> hi guys, what’s the best div scroller? something other than smoothdivscroll
[03:01:23] <xec> ahandy: if by "scroll" you actually mean "scroll" then http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[03:02:26] <xec> oh, he left did he
[03:02:48] <pouete> Hello peoples , a question about jqplot , i am trying to update a jqplot by simply redrawing it, but the tick are still there, how can i delete them ?
[03:04:17] <fn> hello guys
[03:04:32] <fn> got a function: $.fn.testing = function() { };
[03:04:44] <fn> and bind it on doc ready: $('body').testing();
[03:05:03] <fn> how can i detect inline the function, to what testing() is binded?
[03:23:38] <alistair> I've got a resizing function that should be called after everything's loaded, using document ready but it must be firing too early. Anything else I should try?
[03:24:37] <pguruprasad> document ready is fired  much before window.loaded event
[03:24:50] <pguruprasad> @alistair ^^
[03:26:22] <alistair> Thanks you. can you clarify the syntax I should use?
[03:26:28] <alistair> *thank you
[03:26:55] <alistair> $(window).load(function(){ // go }?
[03:27:13] <pguruprasad> did you look at the documentation?
[03:27:42] <alistair> yeah but there is no documentation for window.loaded
[03:29:08] <pguruprasad> $(window).on('load', handlerFunc)
[03:29:19] <pguruprasad> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[03:31:31] <alistair> place my function call inside like this? $(window).on('load', resizeSignposts());
[03:31:39] <alistair> it's not working
[03:33:35] <alistair> ok, getting there, think it's better now
[03:34:08] <PhonicUK> alistair, don't put the brackets in after the function name for the callback
[03:34:19] <PhonicUK> otherwise you just end up invoking that function immediately rather than onload
[03:34:27] <alistair> ahh
[03:34:35] <alistair> ok
[03:34:39] <PhonicUK> also best practice with JQ is to do this:
[03:34:51] <PhonicUK> $(function(){ //startup code goes here });
[03:34:54] <PhonicUK> instead of using onLoad
[03:35:21] <PhonicUK> and put all of your <script> tags at the very bottom of the page, just below your closing HTML tag
[03:41:47] <Cork> PhonicUK: uh... no
[03:41:57] <Cork> you don't put scripts after </html>...
[03:42:06] <PhonicUK> derp, I meant just before
[03:42:08] <Cork> they should be at the bottom of <body> at the latest
[03:42:14] <Cork> wrong again
[03:42:20] <Cork> it should be inside the body
[03:42:28] <PhonicUK> you can put them after </body> and before </html>
[03:42:31] <PhonicUK> passes validation
[03:42:53] <Cork> PhonicUK: they execute, but only cause the browser will error correct the page
[03:43:00] <Cork> it isn't valid to have <script> in side html
[03:43:09] <Cork> it is only valid inside <head> or <body>
[03:43:18] <PhonicUK> in that case the W3C validator may be broken
[03:43:31] <PhonicUK> although I do appear to have all mine just before </body>
[03:43:53] <PhonicUK> eitherway the point is to have them as close to the end of the document as possible and not in the head
[03:44:19] <Cork> PhonicUK: that depends on what your doing with it
[03:44:38] <Cork> but ya in some cases that is where you want them
[03:44:49] <PhonicUK> I can't think of many reasons for javascript to be in the head these days
[03:44:59] <PhonicUK> unless you're doing something very wrong like using javascript to control layout
[03:45:22] <Cork> well ya, but that isn't wrong
[03:45:30] <Cork> ex if you need a none js fallback
[03:45:31] <PhonicUK> wrong/bad practice :P
[03:45:37] <Cork> it isn't
[03:45:49] <PhonicUK> to use javascript for layout? I'd certainly argue its bad practice
[03:45:53] <Cork> its standard practice
[03:46:05] <Cork> PhonicUK: did you read what i just wrote?
[03:46:17] <Cork> if you have a design for none js
[03:46:23] <Cork> and js need to modify it before rendering
[03:46:27] <Cork> you want the js in head
[03:46:35] <Cork> or you will have glitches
[03:46:45] <TuomasL> definitely called for in some cases, js for layout
[03:46:53] <TuomasL> BUT the CSS only will also make it usable
[03:47:16] <PhonicUK> I suppose that's the main thing I don't do, nothing I do any more has non-js fallback
[03:47:24] <PhonicUK> but the JS is never used to change layout or positioning
[03:47:54] <TuomasL> I use js all the time to influence layout, but it'll always work without it. Most likely without the design will not be quite what I meant.
[03:47:55] <Cork> PhonicUK: so you make broken none best practice pages...
[03:48:01] <PhonicUK> my company is pretty agressive about not having any legacy support, doesn't even support < IE10
[03:48:19] <Cork> PhonicUK: none js is not about legacy browsers
[03:48:29] <PhonicUK> if you load the page without JS, you just get a message asking you to disable noscript/etc
[03:49:17] <PhonicUK> although thing to bare in mind is I make web applications, not web sites - if you follow the differenciation
[03:49:22] <Cork> PhonicUK: aka, a none best practice standard page
[03:49:23] <PhonicUK> they perform a utility rather than present information
[03:49:44] <PhonicUK> not at all, if you're performing a function that requires real-time data being moved around, JS becomes a requirement
[03:50:06] <Cork> PhonicUK: if you follow best practice that you comment on a few times now you use progressive enhancement
[03:50:16] <Cork> the page should still work even if the user doesn't have js
[03:50:22] <Cork> at least the main parts of the page should work
[03:50:27] <PhonicUK> I think if you saw what kind of application it was, you wouldn't stick to that
[03:50:44] <PhonicUK> the entire application is one HTML page, anything else is loaded dynamically at runtime by talking to a backend API
[03:50:46] <Cork> PhonicUK: your assuming way to much
[03:51:28] <PhonicUK> it would actually be more than double the effort to make a non-JS page, so it's also a poor economical decision to make the effort when such a small percentage of users require it
[03:51:45] <PhonicUK> and if the data is only useful in real time (i.e. the application cannot perform its function as a static page) then the whole thing becomes moot
[03:51:50] <Cork> PhonicUK: ya, cause the page is designed the wrong way from the start
[03:52:04] <PhonicUK> not at all, if it's real-time or nothing - you can't have static pages
[03:52:07] <Cork> sure there is a way to design webpages that makes the impossible to make none js supporting
[03:52:15] <Cork> i've done them my self in the past
[03:52:18] <Cork> if you do it the RIGHT way though
[03:52:33] <Cork> you get the same functionality but without the "must have js"
[03:53:16] <PhonicUK> you'd be creating one hell of a mess with iframes trying to copy this kind of functionality without javascript
[03:53:25] <Cork> PhonicUK: no
[03:53:49] <PhonicUK> yes, you couldn't do it
[03:53:53] <Cork> lol
[03:54:09] <Cork> PhonicUK: strange i have done a page just like the one your talking about
[03:54:11] <PhonicUK> just one example, my application has a notification area in the bottom left corner for all of the current in-progress or queued tasks
[03:54:22] <PhonicUK> which gets updated by the second
[03:54:24] <Cork> and i have designed a new page with the same functionality that works exactly like what i said
[03:54:30] <PhonicUK> 1 sec..
[03:54:31] <Cork> so yes i know it is very possible to do
[03:54:48] <PhonicUK> https://demo.mcmyadmin.com/
[03:55:03] <PhonicUK> pull off those graphs, the console, without using iframes on constant reloads, and without javascript
[03:55:27] <PhonicUK> not that the graphs are actually showing anything because the resource usage is too low
[03:55:36] <PhonicUK> if the data is more than about 5 seconds old, it's no longer useful
[03:55:42] <Cork> PhonicUK: what part of "main functionality" did you miss?
[03:55:48] <PhonicUK> that is the main functionality!
[03:55:52] <Cork> when you go into an argument please read the comments
[03:56:05] <PhonicUK> I am, I am talking about the core - primary functions
[03:56:11] <Cork> PhonicUK: no your page is completely broken without js
[03:56:17] <Cork> they can't even see what the page is about
[03:56:27] <PhonicUK> this isn't a page, it's an application...
[03:56:31] <Cork> THAT is the design error
[03:56:35] <PhonicUK> *facepalm*
[03:56:52] <Cork> PhonicUK: sure, but you can still make it get to a informative state without js
[03:56:58] <PhonicUK> no - you couldn't
[03:57:04] <PhonicUK> because the data wouldn't be fast enough
[03:57:15] <PhonicUK> if you did that console for example with a reloading iframe
[03:57:28] <Cork> it has nothing to do with iframes...
[03:57:32] <PhonicUK> *facepalm*
[03:57:42] <Cork> i never ever ever said you should do iframe loading
[03:57:58] <PhonicUK> well how else are you going to present live data in a subset of the page?
[03:58:01] <Cork> and i never ever ever said you should have a fully functional page without js
[03:58:14] <Cork> you show a snapshot of the data
[03:58:20] <PhonicUK> if its a snapshot, its not useful
[03:58:24] <Cork> and tell them "for live updates please enable js"
[03:58:36] <Cork> it is, cause then the user will know what it is about
[03:58:49] <erming> why would you want to use that application without live updates? it might as well show a black screen
[03:58:53] <PhonicUK> ^
[03:59:09] <Cork> and they can JUDGE if they care
[03:59:59] <PhonicUK> I don't think anyone would pay the kind of money this software costs for a 'snapshot' of 10 second old console data
[04:00:29] <PhonicUK> I think you're trying to assume an overly broad audience
[04:01:18] <PhonicUK> if what you are selling is interactivity, js becomes a requirement
[04:01:40] <Cork> PhonicUK: sigh
[04:01:45] <PhonicUK> same here :P
[04:01:54] <Cork> why are you trying to make this to be something i'm not saying
[04:02:04] <PhonicUK> I think you're trying to stand on a point that I don't care about
[04:02:10] <PhonicUK> you're going to have to appeal some other way
[04:02:12] <Cork> the point is that the page should be informative about what it has
[04:02:19] <PhonicUK> it's not a *page*
[04:02:21] <PhonicUK> it's an *application*
[04:02:29] <Cork> it is the same thing
[04:02:31] <PhonicUK> no it's not!
[04:02:37] <Cork> it is js running in html
[04:02:39] <Cork> it is a page
[04:02:41] <PhonicUK> *facepalm*
[04:02:55] <PhonicUK> okay, put it this way
[04:03:19] <Cork> and ya,,, sure over react it is obvious that you don't even care to try to understand what i'm saying so ya...
[04:03:30] <PhonicUK> okay, lets take the following:
[04:03:36] <Cork> skipit
[04:03:46] <PhonicUK> I think you have a very outdated view of what the web is
[04:03:51] <Cork> it isn't worth the fight over something you don't want to even understand
[04:03:55] <PhonicUK> Neither do you
[04:04:06] <Cork> PhonicUK: your assuming
[04:04:17] <Cork> i'm creating sites close to that too
[04:04:27] <Cork> the difference is in the approach
[04:04:28] <PhonicUK> I get the impression that you think something like Facebook sits in the same bracket as something like the New York Times
[04:04:46] <Cork> heh, no i don't
[04:05:11] <PhonicUK> I consider something like nytimes.com to be a "web site", it's primary job is to present information to you. Facebook is a web application, it's job is to perform a function. It could well be a local application, but it just happens to run in the browser
[04:05:19] <Cork> sigh...
[04:05:22] <Cork> just drop it
[04:05:29] <PhonicUK> the former uses a browser as a way to present information to the user, the latter uses the browser as a virtual machine to run executable code
[04:05:53] <Cork> this is just getting inflammatory, and i'm not interested in that kind of arguments
[04:06:09] <PhonicUK> well I suppose one wouldn't be interested in an argument in which they have no leg to stand on
[04:06:32] <Cork> PhonicUK: stop trying to make a flamewar
[04:06:39] <Cork> i won't bite
[04:06:56] <PhonicUK> You got me on that one :P
[04:07:01] <gry> heh
[04:07:55] <PhonicUK> I entirely get the argument you want to make, that users should have the choice of whether or not to allow an unknown party to run code on their machine
[04:08:19] <PhonicUK> and so they should be able to evaluate what's the benefit of a site or application is before taking the risk of allowing unknown code on your machine
[04:08:27] <Cork> PhonicUK: that is the after effect of what i'm saying
[04:08:33] <Cork> but it isn't what i'm arguing about
[04:08:36] <PhonicUK> right
[04:09:01] <Cork> what i'm arguing about is that the user should know what they get
[04:09:12] <Cork> not "enable this to see what i will do"
[04:09:43] <PhonicUK> right, I understand that argument - but I still contend it
[04:10:26] <PhonicUK> I'll start with the assertation that people who care about what code runs in their browser are a minority in the upmost extreme
[04:10:50] <PhonicUK> you and I are developers, we understand that you're taking a risk when allowing third party code on your machine
[04:11:57] <PhonicUK> I wouldn't ever try and make a business case for catering to such a small segment of a potential audience
[04:12:13] <Cork> PhonicUK: the problem with this conversation is that your not contending the statment, your accusing and putting words in the other parties mouth to try to push it to be "i was right"
[04:13:24] <PhonicUK> maybe it'd be easier then if I put words in my own mouth and you contend them and try and convince me otherwise :P
[04:15:14] <PhonicUK> I'll start by saying that the principle of designing to the lowest common denominator, and then simply adding to it depending on what features are available (such as javascript) is an outdated and economically inefficient approach to developing web applications, compared to taking the capabilities of 95% of your target market and making that the global requirement
[04:16:06] <PhonicUK> On the basis that you can develop for a single, static and pre-defined target rather than multiple potential targets
[04:17:07] <PhonicUK> and the fewer targets you have to develop for, the lower the development cost
[04:18:33] <PhonicUK> especially when you take into account that assuming a platform that includes javascript by default, means being able to deliver a higher quality UX - in my case, making the page reload because the user clicked the "Start" button because a form had to be submitted would feel slower and clunkier than it appearing to respond instantly with a visual indicator sans-reload.
[04:19:43] <xec> when did #jQuery become #amusingDigressions ?
[04:19:48] * xec grabs some popcorn
[04:19:51] <PhonicUK> lol
[04:20:47] <PhonicUK> Given the economic benefit of only developing for a given feature set rather than the lowest common denominator, I'd argue that sacrificing what ultimately is a idealistic principal is an acceptable course of action
[04:21:12] <PhonicUK> to do otherwise would simply be a case of diminishing returns
[04:21:20] <PhonicUK> #rantover :P
[04:35:53] <And1> Hello folks. I've set up a little script, which hides all of my images and adds the class 'active' to one of them. Then there are two buttons for previous and next image. When clicking the buttong, everything works fine. I also added functionality for left arrow and right arrow keys (lines 35-41). Though, there seems to be a problem. When pressing the keys, one image is omitted. Could anyone please take a look at this? http://lpaste.net/104511
[04:37:03] <Cork> And1: simplest might be to do the hiding with css
[04:37:43] <Cork> and doing something like $(".gallery").addClass("hidden").first().addClass("active")
[04:37:48] <Cork> and then just move the active class
[04:37:59] <Cork> (and from css override the .hidden class)
[04:38:07] <Cork> that way you could remove most of the logic you have right now
[04:39:27] <skullcrasher> how can i use a plugin methods like plugin('method',args) in this code? http://jsfiddle.net/jsdLq/
[04:39:30] <skullcrasher> what to adjust
[04:39:45] <And1> Cork: Could you please explain that a little further?
[04:40:24] <Cork> skullcrasher: you would have to extend the $.fn.mediaedit to handle "methods" as an optional arguemnt
[04:41:16] <skullcrasher> Cork: hmm ok, i also found this http://f6design.com/journal/2012/05/06/a-jquery-plugin-boilerplate/
[04:41:28] <skullcrasher> and there it's done all in this one function
[04:41:54] <skullcrasher> but i threw together several approaches and it's not working for me :)
[04:42:22] <skullcrasher> i started with the code of jquery-boilerplate here https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/blob/master/src/jquery.boilerplate.js
[04:42:58] <skullcrasher> so what to figure out now is how to adjust the $.fn.mediaedit = function to call the plugin function right?
[04:43:39] <skullcrasher> Cork: because i want also use plugin(options)
[04:44:03] <skullcrasher> similar to the bootstrap jquery plugins with modal('show') oder modal(options)
[04:47:56] <And1> Cork: Something like this: http://lpaste.net/104512
[04:54:29] <FransNL_> how do i check if each json object has a property set?
[04:54:47] <FransNL_> all have to have content in order to go forward
[04:55:08] <FransNL_> .each()
[04:55:10] <FransNL_> then what?
[04:56:10] <MikeD_> FransNL_: have you looked at the spec for .each() ?
[04:56:25] <FransNL_> not extensive
[04:56:49] <FransNL_> ah
[04:57:55] <Cork> And1: http://jsfiddle.net/R2XMn/
[04:58:59] <Cork> And1: sorry wrong key event http://jsfiddle.net/R2XMn/1/
[04:59:37] <And1> Cork: I'll try to understand that. Give me a few minutes. : )  Thanks very much!
[05:01:05] <Cork> And1: and here's a version that relies on the gallery array for finding the next image http://jsfiddle.net/R2XMn/2/
[05:01:35] <FransNL_> so i have an multi dimensional array. Only if all the array items has a specific value set, it needs to invoke a function
[05:01:44] <FransNL_> is .each() the way to go?
[05:01:53] <FransNL_> or do i need to look at something else?
[05:02:13] <Cork> FransNL_: uh...
[05:02:25] <Cork> each items?
[05:02:36] <Cork> FransNL_: are you talking about an array of objects?
[05:02:50] <FransNL_> it’s a json
[05:02:53] <And1> Cork: Mh, what are the advantages of one of the two versions?
[05:03:11] <Cork> And1: the second one will work even if there is something inbetween the images
[05:03:27] <Cork> as it is based on the elements with the class and nothing else
[05:03:47] <Cork> the first one only works if the images is the direct sibling to each other
[05:04:08] <Cork> FransNL_: json is a string
[05:04:11] <And1> Cork: Ok, then I'll use this second one. Just to be sure. Maybe some day there will be another html-element between the images.
[05:04:14] <FransNL_> json object
[05:04:21] <Cork> FransNL_: it doesn't explain if what you have is objects of arrays
[05:04:33] <FransNL_> ok..
[05:04:35] <Cork> FransNL_: again json is a string, when you parse it you get objects and arrays
[05:04:36] <FransNL_> let me explain
[05:04:49] <MikeD_> FransNL_:  don't explain, show:  make a jsfiddle.net example
[05:04:51] <Cork> just show a small snippet of the structure (no content needed)
[05:05:02] <aeiou> Does anyone know why you cannot scroll using the mouse wheel whilst you are dragging something within the same window, but if you drag something from a different window onto a page you can?! (Google Chrome)
[05:05:51] <Cork> aeiou: that is browser specific
[05:06:10] <Cork> aeiou: and should prob be asked in there support channel instead of here
[05:06:57] <FransNL_> http://pastebin.com/U42QMXhi
[05:07:18] <FransNL_> that’s the data
[05:07:26] <FransNL_> php output
[05:07:36] <bberry> Cork: i know we talked about this using an array and .extend, but  if i wanted a clone of an object without any references to its origin, how would i do that? (only 1 layer deep)
[05:07:49] <FransNL_> so i need to know if every PreviewURL has data
[05:08:14] <Cork> FransNL_: hmm so { result: { Result: [] } }
[05:08:19] <FransNL_> yup
[05:08:36] <FransNL_> lemme paste the JSON
[05:08:36] <Cork> (would have prefered a json output then a php var_dump)
[05:08:44] <Cork> but anyway
[05:09:30] <bberry> (also for all intents and purposes, it can be JSON object)
[05:10:03] <bberry> s/be JSON/be a JSON/
[05:10:07] <Cork> FransNL_: so you want to know if there is one that dosn't have it?
[05:10:28] <Cork> or do you want to have a list of them?
[05:10:31] <Cork> or ...?
[05:10:39] <FransNL_> the first
[05:10:56] <Cork> FransNL_: there is a few ways then
[05:12:36] <Cork> var valid = true; $.each(data.result.Result, function(elm) { valid = (elm.PreviewURL == undefined || elm.PreviewURL == ''); if(!elm.PreviewURL) { return; } }); alert(valid);
[05:13:17] <Cork> $.grep(data.result.Result, function(elm) { return (elm.PreviewURL == undefined || elm.PreviewURL == ''); }).length > 0;
[05:13:34] <FransNL_> didn’t know i could do grep in jQuery :D
[05:13:36] <FransNL_> cool
[05:13:43] <Cork> opps those two are the complete oposite
[05:13:46] <FransNL_> first one i thought of
[05:13:46] <Cork> $.grep(data.result.Result, function(elm) { return (elm.PreviewURL == undefined || elm.PreviewURL == ''); }).length < 1;
[05:13:56] <bberry> Cork: nevermind, i got my answer
[05:14:09] <SprkDev> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 3 column 1 of the JSON data
[05:14:11] <SprkDev> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js?ver=1.10.2
[05:14:12] <SprkDev> Line 4
[05:14:27] <FransNL_> thnx Cork
[05:14:30] <Cork> SprkDev: validate your json
[05:14:32] <seutje> bberry: slice(0)
[05:15:22] <skullcrasher> ok Cork, tried to extend the function like you mentioned
[05:15:28] <SprkDev> how? I'm not sending json, this is popping for the jquery 1.10.2 file for some reason.
[05:15:35] <Cork> seutje: object not array
[05:15:45] <seutje> oh lol
[05:15:48] <skullcrasher> Cork: could that be the right way? http://jsfiddle.net/2Z7cq/
[05:15:51] <Cork> SprkDev: ya, cause your json isn't valid
[05:15:52] <SprkDev> I don't think its about coding, but some script file is conflicting somehow.
[05:16:27] <Cork> skullcrasher: that is quite close ya
[05:16:37] <seutje> yeah for object u have to extend onto a clean one or build ur own extend
[05:16:45] <Cork> skullcrasher: i would prob name the argument instead of using arguments
[05:16:50] <Cork> but that's about it
[05:17:07] <Cork> seutje: $.extend(true, {}, obj)
[05:17:40] <seutje> yeah, exactly, or do ur own loop if it's guaranteed to be a simple object
[05:17:58] <skullcrasher> Cork: how do you mean?
[05:18:32] <Cork> skullcrasher: function(method, options) { if(!options) { options = method; } }
[05:18:36] <And1> Cork: Instead of adding 'active' to the first element with '.gallery', couldn't I just toggleClass 'hidden'? Or am I thinking wrong about that?
[05:18:59] <Cork> And1: ya, as your not adding and removing from the same element
[05:19:20] <Cork> *you're
[05:19:29] <And1> Cork: I see. Thanks.
[05:20:43] <And1> So, the active element has the classes "hidden active", right?
[05:20:54] <Cork> ya
[05:21:23] <Cork> And1: that is so the image would be visible without js
[05:22:27] <And1> Ok that's good. That would've been my next question. : )
[05:26:26] <And1> Cork: Could you please inspect the image in the link I'll send you? Somehow I still got the same problem with omitting one image. : x
[05:26:58] <Cork> And1: i have pm disabled so you need to tell me before sending random things ^^'
[05:27:48] <And1> I see. May I please send you the link in pm?
[05:28:44] <And1> Cork ^
[05:29:13] <Cork> And1: lol i enabled it already ^^'
[05:30:38] <And1> Thanks. : )
[05:32:23] <Cork> ah
[05:32:29] <Cork> And1: you load the script twice
[05:33:48] <And1> Cork: Uh. Indeed.
[05:34:01] <And1> Cork: Think it makes more sense when loading it in the body, as I don't need it on all sites.
[05:34:35] <Cork> And1: doesn't really depend on if you load it in body or head (except for some cms systems)
[05:35:09] <And1> Cork: Oh ok. Then I'll put it in my header as I'm used to this.
[05:35:40] <And1> Thought that would make sense out of performance reasons.
[05:36:41] <Cork> And1: there is, but not in relation to one page and not another
[05:37:00] <Cork> And1: scripts loaded in head will block rendering of the content until they are loaded
[05:37:10] <Cork> And1: script at the end of the body doesn't
[05:37:28] <And1> Cork: Uh, there was a reason for putting it in the body. It doesn't work when putting it in the header. I don't know why, though.
[05:37:46] <Cork> leave it in the head for a min then
[05:38:11] <MikeD_> if you have head script refering to dom object, it won't work (the dom hasn't been fully loaded) - unless you put the function inside a domready event
[05:38:13] <Cork> cause that shouldn't break it
[05:38:19] <And1> Cork: Done.
[05:38:31] <Cork> MikeD_: the script is in a $() wrapper so ya not the case
[05:38:32] <MikeD_> you work around that by putting the script at the end of the body and the dom nodes are all created before the script runs
[05:39:23] <MikeD_> hmm.. that's the normal reason... kinda curious why that's true if not that case
[05:39:31] <Cork> And1: your sure?
[05:39:34] <Cork> works fine here
[05:39:46] <And1> Cork: When entering url.net/work directly in the address bar, than it works. But not if visiting the root and then clicking the link to work. Can you reproduce this?
[05:39:58] <Cork> ah
[05:40:14] <And1> Cork: That's probably because on link-click just the right div is refreshed.
[05:40:31] <Cork> ya it is
[05:40:35] <Cork> didn't know you used that
[05:40:59] <Cork> And1: though that will leave you with some problems in the current implementations
[05:41:20] <Cork> And1: you need to clean up after the page has been switched
[05:41:34] <Cork> as the old code will linger around
[05:41:45] <And1> Uh oh. That doesn't sound good.
[05:41:53] <Cork> best option is prob to replace $(document).on("click", "span", function () {
[05:42:12] <Cork> with $("#prev, #next").on("click", function () {
[05:42:30] <Cork> though you need to remove the $(function() {}) wrapper too
[05:42:39] <Cork> well actually not need to
[05:42:41] <Cork> but you should :)
[05:42:49] <Cork> ugg
[05:42:56] <Cork> forgot about the keydown binding
[05:43:16] <Cork> And1: it needs to be on document, so you will have to clean that one up manually
[05:43:40] <Cork> $(document).off('keydown')
[05:45:25] <And1> Cork: At the end of $(function, right?
[05:46:10] <And1> I updated the js-file.
[05:46:36] <Cork> And1: no you need to do it when you switch to another page
[05:47:00] <Cork> so the "link-click" extension most likely have to either provide a hook
[05:47:05] <Cork> or get extended
[05:47:25] <And1> That would be my include.js then.
[05:49:45] <And1> Maybe I could just put the code at the beginning of this file. Then on every link-click the script tries to execute it. : x
[06:00:15] <And1> Cork: And I tried to updade gallery.js with the line you gave me and moved the keydown event to on document.
[06:15:15] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[06:15:33] <silv3r_m00n> while scrolling inside a div, i want to prevent the parent/body from scrolling, when the div reaches its upper or lower ends
[06:15:35] <silv3r_m00n> how ?
[06:19:02] <MikeD_> silv3r_m00n: i expect that to happen because it happens everywhere else
[06:20:58] <silv3r_m00n> MikeD_: its a select type of div, which has a list of items which user can scroll and select from, it hinders usability if the parent starts scrolling towards the edges
[06:21:27] <silv3r_m00n> for instance, the html select tag does not let the parent body scroll
[06:21:32] <silv3r_m00n> i need a similar behaviour
[06:35:37] <star_prone> hi
[06:36:57] <star_prone> I have an ajax that it's supposed to send some data in order to be saved into the database; the problem is that the data is too big it is being truncated (I use POST method)
[06:37:05] <star_prone> is there a way to compact it?
[06:37:22] <MikeD_> too big for POST?  you might have a serverside limit
[06:37:46] <Cork> most likely
[06:37:51] <Cork> php has one by default
[06:38:09] <MikeD_> php.ini has that default set _really_ low  (2mb?)
[06:40:47] <star_prone> so what you're saying is that post doesn't have a limit in size?
[06:40:59] <star_prone> I can send how much information I like?
[06:41:18] <sibe7691> thats exactly what he is not saying
[06:41:52] <MikeD_> are you using apache for your web server?
[06:42:04] <MikeD_> apache + php?
[06:42:36] <star_prone> yes
[06:42:37] <star_prone> indeed
[06:42:59] <MikeD_> did you look in php.ini for the file size limit?
[06:43:49] <star_prone> sibe7691: then what does the file size limit from php.ini has to do with it?
[06:45:27] <MikeD_> ok, it's my fault for jumping to the conclusion that the limit is imposed by the server config - it's the problem that i've been bitten by a half-dozen times in so many years
[06:46:00] <MikeD_> instead I should have asked you 20 more questions about your exact situation... to probably arrive at the same conclusion :)
[06:46:32] <MikeD_> when you say the data is truncated... how are you seeing truncation?
[06:46:56] <MikeD_> is the database field too small?  is the stored procedure parameter field too small?
[06:48:29] <star_prone> MikeD: 1. upload_max_filesize = 8M -> changed to 100M
[06:49:10] <star_prone> MikeD: post_max_size = 8M -> changed to 100M
[06:50:14] <star_prone> 2. I see the truncation in $_POST array which doesn't contain all the information I trying to send; if I reduce the size of what I'm sending, it works perfectly
[06:51:47] <MikeD_> hmm - did you try putting the content you submit into a textarea in your page to see if it was truncated before transit?
[06:52:00] <star_prone> MikeD: 3. I understand everything you told me about the server side, never argued with that. I did though had another question: is POST limited to a specific size? or AJAX for that matter
[06:52:08] <MikeD_> do you have the same behavior in two different browsers?
[06:52:19] <MikeD_> POST is not supposed to be limited
[06:52:38] <zylophone> uhm, i'm not going crazy am i - a hidden input is simply <input type="hidden" name="foo" value="bar" /> ?
[06:53:00] <zylophone> when i create an element, i just can't set any value, it always comes out as a blank string
[06:53:07] <MikeD_> your crazy status is still in question, but that is the correct syntax for a hidden input :p
[06:53:25] <zylophone> heh. well that's a right wtf for me then ;)
[06:53:35] <zylophone> post can be limited for server protection
[06:53:56] <zylophone> e.g. instead of uploading a small jpeg to convert to ico for example, a user could upload a HUGE 10gb file a few times
[06:54:00] <zylophone> kinda killing your server
[06:54:19] <MikeD_> right, that's why i started _there_
[06:54:33] <MikeD_> but getting a truncated value in $_POST is strange
[06:54:39] <zylophone> yeah, i just read the last few lines, so _there!_ :p
[06:55:11] <zylophone> i'm having to resort to setting a data-value in my hidden element! fml
[06:55:15] <MikeD_> fwiw, i meant _there_ as opposed to somewhere else - not trying to sound like a dick
[06:55:38] <MikeD_> can you create the element, then set its value?
[06:55:48] <zylophone> no, i'm just in a funny mood atm
[06:55:58] <zylophone> well, i'm templating using embeddedjs
[06:56:02] <zylophone> not the nodejs variant
[06:56:25] <zylophone> <input type="hidden" name="workspace-id" value="<%= workspaceId %>" data-value="<%= workspaceId %>" />
[06:56:27] <star_prone> MikeD: no, I didn't try to put the content into a textarea; I'm sending an object
[06:56:50] <star_prone> MikeD_: I will try from a different browser
[06:56:51] <zylophone> see, data-value is set as expected, but value is always "". even if i hardcode a string in there, it's still ""
[06:58:34] <MikeD_> star_prone: $("body").append('<textarea>' + JSON.stringify( theObject ) + '</textarea>' );
[06:59:16] <MikeD_> also, if you have a custom serialization routine, check that for funky size restriction
[06:59:18] <star_prone> I have debugged the object it contains what it's supposed to contain, but I can certainly do that too
[06:59:21] <star_prone> just a sec pls
[06:59:24] <rahuldroy> hey guys, what is the easiest way to disable browser navigation using jquery. I don't want users to press backspace or refresh the page.
[06:59:30] <zylophone> don't do that
[06:59:39] <zylophone> lots of puppies die when you do that
[06:59:50] <zylophone> and noone will ever visit your site ever again
[06:59:56] <MikeD_> yeah, it's better to just let whatever mayhem the back button causes happen than to do whatever evil you're considering
[07:00:28] <MikeD_> "no back button" feels like putting trapdoors in the Internet
[07:00:40] <zylophone> hey, why not disable the switching of tabs to another page, why not disable the close button on the browser, why not disable the omg-why-do-this
[07:00:41] <star_prone> is the same situation in other browsers too
[07:01:37] <MikeD_> star_prone: have to looked at live headers during the post conversation?
[07:01:44] <marc_v92> Just do what a bunch of Google pages do…put 15,000 redirects in between every page, each of which puts a new item into history.
[07:01:53] <star_prone> MikeD_: huh?
[07:01:53] <rahuldroy> it is an intranet application I am working on and it is a huge form
[07:02:19] <star_prone> I have looked at the headers when I sent the request
[07:02:25] <star_prone> there is nothing funny
[07:02:32] <star_prone> I think....
[07:02:34] <rahuldroy> the amount of times I have accidentally pressed the backspace while typing and I lost everything :(
[07:02:45] <zylophone> ha ha!
[07:02:58] <MikeD_> i use the firefox plugin "Live HTTP headers" to see what's going on between the browser and the server
[07:03:01] <zylophone> i did it once, then learnt not to press the backspace. i haven't done it since :p
[07:03:09] <zylophone> live http headers++
[07:03:43] <zylophone> is it a php script that's handling the ajax request?
[07:03:53] <zylophone> there's a php max post limit as well as a server max post limit
[07:03:53] <star_prone> zylophone: yes
[07:04:35] <MikeD_> you know what else might be screwing the pooch?  magic quote - is the longer data using a different kind of quote that then breaks when it's converted into the $_POST array?
[07:04:37] <RecoJohnson> How can I check if a variable exists in this situation: https://gist.github.com/btiessen/b0efba77f80a8f2b7d27 I need to evaluate dynamic variables.
[07:04:40] <zylophone> may be worth checking the php.ini for the apache / php-fpm set up
[07:05:01] <zylophone> what exactly is the problem? too lazy to scroll up and filter out all the crap
[07:05:34] <MikeD_> zylophone: large POST getting truncated somewhere between the serialization of a large object and the $_POST array
[07:05:43] <MikeD_> small POST works properly
[07:05:53] <star_prone> MikeD_: I don't think that is the problem
[07:05:56] <zylophone> how large?
[07:06:21] <zylophone> does the server receive the data properly
[07:06:29] <zylophone> iirc there's a serialization limit in either js / jquery
[07:06:36] <zylophone> i've run in to that problem before
[07:06:46] <zylophone> i think it's a jquery limit
[07:06:54] <star_prone> one more think which I think it might be important: I don't serialize the object, I give it as a value to data parameter
[07:07:04] <star_prone> is that what might cause the problem?
[07:07:15] <MikeD_> oh, i didn't use jquery during the time I was sending large post
[07:07:35] <MikeD_> somebody is serializing that object
[07:08:31] <zylophone> star_prone: it'll be serialized internally
[07:08:59] <star_prone> zylophone: yes, I know, that is why i don't serialize it
[07:09:02] <zylophone> check the net in firebug for the data that is set to teh server
[07:09:45] <star_prone> zylophone: what should I look for?
[07:12:24] <zylophone> activate the net panel in firebug, then look for the call to your php script, then check the data sent, it'll be in  the headers, and check for data given back by the script
[07:13:09] <zylophone> can you do a jsfiddle?
[07:13:35] <MikeD_> if the server decided to give up on accepting content, would the $_POST array get loaded with whatever it acquired until it gave up or would it just error completely?
[07:14:17] <zylophone> the ajax call would fail
[07:14:23] <zylophone> max_limit_reached or some such
[07:14:39] <MikeD_> btw, did you restart the php service after you upped the limit in php.ini?
[07:14:59] <zylophone> exactly how big a data are we talking here? files? or just text?
[07:16:26] <MikeD_> idk
[07:17:06] <zylophone> star_prone: ^^
[07:18:47] <star_prone> MikeD_, zylophone:
[07:18:56] <star_prone> 1. I have restarted the server
[07:19:11] <star_prone> 2. The script runs until the end, no errors
[07:19:17] <star_prone> 3. only text
[07:19:29] <star_prone> 4. the data send seems to be correct
[07:19:48] <star_prone> 5. jsfiddle with what I send and what I receive in PHP?
[07:20:36] <zylophone> what exactly does the php script do
[07:20:49] <zylophone> there are so many variables here that you kinda need to filter out for yourself
[07:21:04] <zylophone> if you know the data that is sent to the server is fine, then jquery is doing it's job right, so it's your php script
[07:21:52] <zylophone> log the output of the script to a /tmp/some-file to see what it actually outputs is what you receive
[07:22:41] <star_prone>  my php script is doing this: echo "<pre>"; print_r($_POST); echo "</pre>";
[07:23:24] <zylophone> you need to learn about security
[07:23:53] <zylophone> printing anything sent by $_GET or $_POST is stupid
[07:23:59] <zylophone> you're just asking for trouble!
[07:24:04] <MikeD_> yeah, but it's fine for debugging
[07:24:29] <star_prone> zylophone: I'm debugging the application
[07:24:31] <star_prone> :)
[07:24:34] <zylophone> ahh ok
[07:24:43] <star_prone> this is why I'm printing
[07:24:54] <zylophone> var_dump it to a file to check what $_POST is
[07:25:07] <star_prone> the php script is supposed to save the data into a database
[07:25:12] <star_prone> it worked just fine
[07:25:13] <zylophone> or just make a mock form, and call the script directly
[07:25:24] <zylophone> i hope you're validating before you insert into teh db
[07:25:33] <zylophone> if it worked just fine, then what the heck is the problem
[07:25:47] <star_prone> and it is still working fine if i remove some of the data
[07:25:54] <star_prone> I validate the data :)
[07:26:24] <star_prone> I have a dynamic form, I add fields dynamically
[07:26:44] <star_prone> and if I add too many, I will reveice just a part of the form
[07:28:40] <MikeD_> yeah, i definitely should have asked that question sooner :)
[07:29:06] <star_prone> in firebug, the size of the request seems to be 94.52KB
[07:29:31] <m1su> how many inputs are there in total?
[07:30:38] <star_prone> ~740 or more
[07:31:00] <m1su> check for max_input_vars in your php.ini maybe
[07:31:11] <MikeD_> that's a thing?
[07:31:12] <m1su> cant recall the default limit, but i think it was 1000
[07:31:18] <krambiorix> hi, i have a jquery script like (function( $ ) {  $.fn.myfunc1 = function(){...}; .fn.myfunc2= function(){...}; });   -> how can define and access a global variable ?
[07:32:11] <m1su> http://hu1.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.max-input-vars it is yes
[07:33:22] <MikeD_> m1su: good to know, likely would never have hit that myself though
[07:33:44] <MikeD_> i feel like asking people for more than 20 questions is too much, let alone hundreds
[07:34:39] <m1su> ye tbh you shouldn't ever run into this limit
[07:35:30] <star_prone> I don't ask people for anything
[07:35:43] <star_prone> I just give them the possibility to do things
[07:35:45] <star_prone> :)
[07:36:13] <MikeD_> but you are generating hundreds of unique inputs?
[07:36:18] <star_prone> anyway, I have found that the request made from the client doesn't contain  the entire form
[07:36:34] <MikeD_> oh, that's a clue
[07:36:42] <star_prone> hmmmmm... yeah, kind of
[07:37:34] <star_prone> they can add something on the page, they have a predefined form, loaded through ajax, and that form will be saved into an object in javascript and then sent to the server to be saved
[07:40:20] <star_prone> ok
[07:40:25] <star_prone> I found the problem
[07:40:34] <star_prone> it was the max_input_vars
[07:40:41] <star_prone> m1su: thank you
[07:41:48] <MikeD_> that must be one hell of a script to put away all that data
[07:42:11] <m1su> np
[07:44:37] <BillCriswell> What is max_input_vars set at?
[07:46:57] <star_prone> 1000
[07:47:13] <star_prone> actually, by default, that line is commented
[07:48:29] <BillCriswell> Jesus.
[07:49:15] <MikeD_> not even Jesus will help you with >1000 input buttons on a form :p

[08:05:13] <Wanaoishi> Hi
[08:05:38] <Wanaoishi> is there anyone knowing a good plugin for jquery for building a wizard for a registration page?
[08:05:41] <Wanaoishi> thanks
[08:07:57] <rahuldroy> Hey guys, Can you tell me what is wrong with this code. I am new to Jquery. I am trying to skip the if($('.ChangedInput')... bit   http://jsfiddle.net/7BVj4/
[08:10:49] <Onionnion> What's the proper way to access the object that was selected via an event binder such as .mouseover()
[08:11:36] <Onionnion> Like if I have: $(".navbar").mouseover(function() { this.css("background-color", "gray"); });
[08:11:49] <marc_v92> Onionnion: $(this)
[08:12:15] <brunoais> rahuldroy, let me see if I get this streight
[08:12:18] <brunoais> *straight
[08:13:01] <brunoais> rahuldroy, you want to warn the user if he is trying to change the page he is going to that is not submitting the form, is that it?
[08:13:21] <rahuldroy> brunoais: exactly
[08:13:21] <Onionnion> hmm, no success: http://jsfiddle.net/ZaXY5/1/
[08:13:23] <brunoais> *warn if he has made changes to the contents
[08:14:05] <brunoais> rahuldroy, the idea would be to place a submit event and that should place a flag var to true
[08:14:38] <brunoais> in the "beforeunload" event, you check that var
[08:15:29] <Raydiation> is there a way to do this? $('[data-app-slide-toggle-area="*"]');
[08:15:44] <Raydiation> i want to select all elements that have a data-app-slide-toggle-area="something"
[08:15:48] <BillCriswell> Man, I abuse the hell out of !important in print style sheets.
[08:15:57] <Raydiation> something must at least be one character
[08:16:26] <rahuldroy> brunoais: I have just updated the code to show a bit more http://jsfiddle.net/7BVj4/1/
[08:16:27] <brunoais> Onionnion, it's weird to have a <nav> inside <nav>
[08:16:32] <brunoais> shouldn't it be a list?
[08:16:37] <Raydiation> $('[data-app-slide-toggle-area!=""]') selects all elements
[08:16:48] <Onionnion> brunoais, oh, you're right, oops
[08:17:16] <Onionnion> just sort of quickly jotted this thing down in jsfiddle without thinking too much of the tag
[08:17:58] <brunoais> Raydiation, you are adding the "submit" listener after it is fired. You have to do that before it is fired
[08:18:10] <brunoais> ups, wrong username
[08:18:18] <brunoais> rahuldroy, ^
[08:18:46] <Raydiation> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10641258/jquery-select-data-attributes-that-arent-empty
[08:18:48] <Raydiation> got it
[08:19:00] <dman777_alter> is there  chart where I can plug in two date ranges such as from 01-19-2014 to 05-23-2014  and it will plot the date ranges for the labels?
[08:19:02] <brunoais> Raydiation, [data-app-slide-toggle-area]
[08:19:14] <Raydiation> brunoais: that doesnt work :P
[08:19:20] <brunoais> Raydiation, why?
[08:19:35] <brunoais> Oh
[08:19:37] <brunoais> then this:
[08:19:55] <brunoais> Raydiation, [data-app-slide-toggle-area]:not([data-app-slide-toggle-area=""])
[08:20:04] <brunoais> Raydiation, ^ that?
[08:20:32] <Raydiation> that selects all elements
[08:20:51] <brunoais> really?
[08:20:59] <brunoais> I didn't expect that, thb
[08:21:09] <brunoais> I need to test that, then
[08:21:40] <Onionnion> fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/ZaXY5/2/
[08:22:25] <berger_> hi! I make a call to $.post and that used to work just fine. Now suddenly I get a net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET on windows only… any ideas?
[08:23:10] <rahuldroy> brunoais: still not getting it. Been a long day :(
[08:23:26] <BillCriswell> berger_: Sounds like you might not be preventing the default action on whatever you're doing.
[08:24:00] <brunoais> rahuldroy, http://jsfiddle.net/BfQT5/35/
[08:24:12] <brunoais> the original is not mine. I just borrowed
[08:24:23] <brunoais> this is the original:
[08:24:24] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/BfQT5/
[08:24:34] <berger_> BillCriswell: it’s a form sumit and I do event.preventDefault();
[08:24:53] <brunoais> rahuldroy, wasn't that what you wanted?
[08:25:29] <brunoais> berger_, which browsers?
[08:25:55] <brunoais> berger_, At first glance, your issue is outside the javascript scope
[08:26:46] <brunoais> Onionnion, oh.
[08:26:47] <berger_> brunoais: all on windows. yeah i find i rather strange too, because it used to work
[08:26:50] <rahuldroy> rahuldroy: If any input contains the class "ChangedInput" and user is trying to navigate to another page then it should show a warning. The warning must not be displayed if the submit button is pressed as validation is done on PHP.
[08:27:14] <randint> Hi all
[08:27:26] <brunoais> this is gaining quite some competition
[08:27:28] <randint> Newbie here
[08:27:56] <Onionnion> brunoais, my issue is the mouseover() not seeming to bind $(this) to what I mean for it to bind to?
[08:28:11] <Onionnion> not sure why I put a ?
[08:28:22] <antlong> Does anyone have a few moments to give me some input on a ui for a browser game
[08:28:37] <brunoais> Onionnion, use a <ol><li>elem1</li></ol> or the like
[08:29:09] <marc_v92> Onnion: http://jsfiddle.net/ZaXY5/3/
[08:29:18] <marc_v92> Missing the closing parenthesis after the closing brace.
[08:29:47] <marc_v92> Onionnion ^^
[08:29:49] <randint> I need a cool ui
[08:29:59] <marc_v92> randint: Look up jQuery UI
[08:30:32] <randint> Do I need to study ton of books,
[08:31:02] <marc_v92> Onionnion: You might also want to consider using the .on() syntax instead; it’s more standard practice. http://jsfiddle.net/ZaXY5/4/

[08:41:46] <rahuldroy> brunoais: thanks for your help so far
[08:42:09] <brunoais> RecoJohnson, HTMLCollection object does not have a forEach
[08:42:38] <brunoais> rahuldroy, did you understand the clues I gave you a while ago?
[08:43:08] <rahuldroy> rahuldroy: not really
[08:45:44] <brunoais> rahuldroy, pinging yourself does not work. you have to ping me
[08:45:45] <rahuldroy> brunoais: would it simply be if redirection is submit then do normal steps else check if class changed input exists
[08:46:30] <brunoais> rahuldroy, yeah, that's the idea but you need to know if it is a submit, so you need to listen to that DOM event
[08:53:10] <xniz> ello :)
[08:53:29] <rahuldroy> brunoais: a better way might be if page redirection is taking place, check if it was caused by a submit else check for changed inputs
[08:53:54] <brunoais> rahuldroy, yes.
[09:00:12] <delboy1978uk> any of you guys used appframework?
[09:02:13] <delboy1978uk> i beleive its either a fork of jquery or built on top of it or sometrhing
[09:02:47] <Wanaoishi> I all is there anyone using fuelux wizard?
[09:05:05] <delboy1978uk> for whatever reason I cant seem to get $('a.reviewdetails').on('click',function(){ to work
[09:05:48] <delboy1978uk> http://m.allagents.co.uk click on reviews > latest reviews and then i just want an alert when i click on a review
[09:12:14] <delboy1978uk> pretty quiet in here today
[09:12:55] <zylophone> how do i pull a list of all elements that have a particular data attribute?
[09:14:59] <jessica_> Hi, can anybody help me with this?
[09:15:13] <jessica_> how to bind bPopup modal overlay with submit button?
[09:20:14] <Raydiation> is there a way to tell if an event.target originated from a dom element or its children?
[09:20:34] <gnarf> `contains @Raydiation
[09:20:35] <gnarf> ?
[09:20:38] <gnarf> `api contains @Raydiation
[09:20:38] <b-ot> Raydiation: No matches.
[09:20:42] <tw2113> morning gnarf
[09:20:47] <Raydiation> gnarf: is that efficient?
[09:20:52] <gnarf> `api jquery.contains @Raydiation
[09:20:53] <b-ot> Raydiation: jQuery.contains(): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[09:20:59] <Raydiation> i mean theres event bubbling right?
[09:21:28] <gnarf> sure, if you bind on a parent, the target is pretty much guaranteed to be on a child or the element itself
[09:22:07] <gnarf> but i assumed you were binding on a grandparent and wanted to find which of some list of parents was the event's parent
[09:22:40] <gnarf> in which case, you could always $(event.target).closest('.thing-you-want')
[09:22:48] <gnarf> looking up is easier than down
[09:23:03] <gnarf> contains isn't particularly expensive either
[09:23:07] <Raydiation> gnarf: https://dpaste.de/f485#L30
[09:23:25] <Raydiation> i create an element with data-apps-slide-toggle=".slide-up-area"
[09:23:44] <Raydiation> if i click outside of .slide-up-area i want all other areas to slide up
[09:23:49] <Raydiation> but not the current one
[09:24:03] <Raydiation> basically hide on focus lost
[09:24:08] <gnarf> hrm
[09:24:16] <gnarf> feels like you should be using event delegation
[09:24:46] <gnarf> $(document).on('click', '[data-apps-slide-toggle]', function(event) { })
[09:25:04] <innociv> So I'm trying to do some html manipulation of a contenteditable div. How do I add html while keeping the caret in the same place? It moves if to the start when I change the html.
[09:25:07] <Raydiation> should also work if i click somewhere else
[09:25:08] <gnarf> will give you clicks anywhere in the document that target a data-apps-slide-toggle
[09:26:06] <frank_o> Hi, how is `var scroller = new AppScroll({ toolbar: document.getElementsByClassName('some-class')[0], scroller: document.getElementsByClassName('some-other-class')[0] });` best written in jQuery?
[09:26:10] <frank_o> I'm trying to add this cool lib: https://github.com/jakiestfu/AppScroll.js (fixes the "website dragging" issue caused on iPhones, iPads etc.)
[09:26:19] <Raydiation> as in: the slide up should happen if clicked on everything but the target area
[09:26:26] <Raydiation> anything*
[09:26:33] <gnarf> Raydiation: including the background color?
[09:26:47] <Raydiation> including the body
[09:27:16] <Raydiation> if the area is in the lower right corner and open, i want to slide it up if i click in the upper left corner
[09:27:26] <Raydiation> the button is just for opening
[09:27:30] <gnarf> Raydiation: are these elements created at page load, or are they injected later?
[09:27:34] <Raydiation> page load
[09:28:03] <skullcrasher> how can i fire a custom event on an element after $.ajax is complete?
[09:28:32] <BillCriswell> skullcrasher: .done(function(){ $('.some-el').trigger('custom-event-name'); });
[09:28:55] <skullcrasher> so not within the ajax options? complete: function() ...
[09:28:57] <gnarf> you could just var toggles = $('[data-apps-slide-toggle]'); toggles.click(function(event) { toggles.not(this).slideUp(); $(this).slideDown(); event.stopPropagation(); }); $(document).click(function() { toggles.slideUp(); });
[09:29:39] <Raydiation> that would slide up the buttons
[09:29:46] <Raydiation> not the areas :)
[09:30:20] <gnarf> Raydiation well, like 80% of the code is there man
[09:30:22] <delboy1978uk> anyone can help? i cant get a simple alert happening! :-o  http://m.allagents.co.uk click on reviews > latest reviews and then i just want an alert when i click on one of the <li>'s
[09:30:26] <gnarf> just ike add .closest('area')
[09:30:28] <gnarf> and your done
[09:30:33] <Raydiation> ok thanks
[09:30:54] <gnarf> the idea being, stop prop when it was a "slide down" action so the document click doesn't trigger its slideUps
[09:30:55] <gnarf> yeah?
[09:30:57] <gnarf> got it?
[09:31:02] <gnarf> cuz i gotta run for lunch
[09:31:20] <Raydiation> gnarf: yeah thanks :)
[09:34:05] <skullcrasher> BillCriswell: almost working. just don't know how i get my element into the done function

[09:48:54] <matt__> BillCriswell: ty =)
[09:48:57] <BillCriswell> I wonder if the J-Archive is willing to open up their data.
[09:49:06] <BillCriswell> matt__: No problem, tw2113 gave you the link though haha.
[09:49:09] <innociv> I can't find one that's as simple as $selector.getCaretPosition()  $selector.setCaretPosition(i)
[09:49:19] <andersonvom> hey folks, looking at this bug (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12761) I'm wondering what's the way to go about it, since I'm running the latest Firefox and jQuery and still see the issue.
[09:49:21] * tw2113 renames himself to BallCriswell
[09:49:25] <matt__> BillCriswell: oh yes lol
[09:49:37] <matt__> tw2113: thanks =)
[09:52:37] <daniel31> innociv: yes. Why do you ask? I have had exactly this problem in the last 24 hours. I liked jquery.caret from http://code.accursoft.com/caret . it's very good but doesnt cope well with inner html.
[09:53:17] <innociv> Because I have a contenteditable that I need to manipulate the html of while perserving where the caret is.
[09:53:39] <daniel31> innociv: another I found was http://www.examplet.org/jquery/caret.php which can deal with selection rnages as well as caret positions, but it is slightly more complex than the accursoft caret library.
[09:53:47] <daniel31> innociv: ironicly this is the problem I am having too. I have given up for now. Please letme know what you find.
[09:54:12] <innociv> That last one doesn't deal with contenteditable
[09:54:14] <Wanaoishi> http://fiddle.jshell.net/D6Aeu/
[09:54:32] <daniel31> you're right, it doesn't.
[09:54:35] <Wanaoishi> someone could help me please with this annoying bug of Fuelux
[09:55:14] <innociv> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16835365/set-cursor-to-specific-position-in-ckeditor/16859577#16859577
[09:55:34] <BillCriswell> Wanaoishi: Create a working demo at jsfiddle and you're a lot more likely to get help.
[09:55:35] <daniel31> Hello all. In my browser console, I can use JQuery to select any DOM element I need. So why is it when I try to act on that selection using any jquery method (e.g. $('selector').html(); etc.), I get the error "Undefined is not a function"?
[09:56:24] <BillCriswell> daniel31: You might be trying to use $ before jQuery is available.
[09:56:43] <BillCriswell> decx: duch must take fridays off.
[09:56:45] <BillCriswell> Smart man.
[09:57:02] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/WeWy7/3/ seems to work
[09:57:04] <Wanaoishi> BillTheButcher:  already done http://fiddle.jshell.net/D6Aeu/
[09:57:25] <Wanaoishi> the link was in my previous message
[09:58:29] <daniel31> BillCriswell: merely typing $ into the browser does return a jquery object. and I can get a DOM object by typing $(selector); :-S
[09:59:14] <BillCriswell> So $('.selector') is working but not $('.selector').html() ?
[09:59:20] <daniel31> innociv if its not too indescrete, may I ask what kind of proejct you're working on?
[09:59:36] <innociv> Nope.
[10:00:08] <daniel31> BillCriswell: Correct.
[10:00:13] <decx> BillCriswell i havent done anything all week -.-
[10:00:20] <andersonvom> the bug I mentioned before is the Empty string passed to getElementById() on Firefox.
[10:00:39] <BillCriswell> decx: I delivered a "gold candidate" but it feels very... bronzy.
[10:00:53] <BillCriswell> daniel31: What does $('.selector').length return?
[10:01:23] <daniel31> BillCriswell: undefined
[10:01:25] <decx> i wrote a bill on monday. so technically i made money
[10:01:42] <BillCriswell> daniel31: How about jQuery.fn.jquery
[10:02:18] <daniel31> jQuery is not defined. ($ on its own is Okay though)
[10:02:31] <daniel31> What's more, I'm sure I had this problem before. Not sure I solved it though.
[10:03:20] <Wanaoishi> no one for giving me a hand on this http://fiddle.jshell.net/D6Aeu/
[10:03:58] <decx> just a moment while i go through these 5782 lines of js
[10:04:32] <decx> meaning: separate your problem into a specific demo
[10:04:36] <BillCriswell> daniel31: That doesn't make sense.
[10:04:49] <BillCriswell> $ isn't jQuery in your code in that case.
[10:04:50] <daniel31> I know. :-(
[10:05:38] <daniel31> Hmm...
[10:05:45] <Wanaoishi> decx give me a sec I will try to do that.
[10:06:01] <daniel31> $ returns "function $(selector, [startNode]) { [Command Line API] }"
[10:06:24] <BillCriswell> daniel31: That's not jQuery.
[10:07:47] <BillCriswell> Wanaoishi: I think there's just a bug with this thing and the new version of bootstrap maybe.
[10:08:23] <daniel31> I'm trying to build an extension which injects jquery into the page for later use by the extension. As far as I can tell, that all happens okay. It's just the browser's javascript console that gives me problem, which makes it difficult to prototype and explore my options. Do you have any advice for allowing jquery to be loaded and used by the browser's javascript console?
[10:09:29] <haemly> Hello, im using the JQuery Date picker, normally I create a div for the date picker, and put the following in the window.onload: $("#datepickerstart").datepicker(); <-- This works. However, in this case the div for the date picker will not be created until a user clicks a button, so I can't just put: $("#datepickerstart").datepicker(); in the window.onload, as it doesnt recognize the ID name. Any ideas?
[10:10:14] <Wanaoishi> BillCriswell: Yeah that's a possibility but now I don't use bootstrap js only the fuelux one.
[10:10:35] <Wanaoishi> decx I have trimed the JS
[10:12:19] <Wanaoishi> ok I had to use the boostrap js so perhaps there is a compatibility problem … that would be the kind of pain in the ass I can't do … v
[10:12:21] <Wanaoishi> http://fiddle.jshell.net/D6Aeu/2/
[10:18:28] <BillCriswell> Wanaoishi: http://fiddle.jshell.net/D6Aeu/4/
[10:19:58] <Wanaoishi> OMG I love You BillCriswell how did you do that?
[10:21:35] <BillCriswell> Wanaoishi: Just tried grabbing everything from the CDN.
[10:21:35] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/LFLP2/ daniel31
[10:21:54] <jop008> when I copy source from http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/listview-collapsible-item-flat/ and put it in a new page then the ibutton iccons to the rigth don't align to each othe
[10:22:12] <BillCriswell> Wanaoishi: It's still annoying though cause I don't know where the CDN for their CSS is? I'd just try to copy that as much as possible.
[10:22:21] <daniel31> thanks innociv
[10:22:31] <Wanaoishi> yeah I will try that
[10:22:45] <innociv> just call the saveCaret before changing the html inside the contenteditable, and restoreCaret after
[10:22:53] <daniel31> that's brilliant!
[10:24:46] <innociv> I don't know what'll happen if you delete the text where the caret was in your manipulation, but so long as you're just doing things like wrapping html around the text it works fine
[10:25:42] <innociv> I just put saveCaret() at the start of my event that changes html, and .restoreCaret() after and it works well
[10:25:53] <jop008> So this is what I got http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-05-23_at_19.22.14-3bInoon1.png
[10:26:12] <jop008> not the same as http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/listview-collapsible-item-flat/
[10:26:20] <jop008> must I copy CSS also?
[10:26:28] <BillCriswell> jop008: It would have to be something to do with your CSS.
[10:26:40] <jop008> I have no css
[10:26:48] <jop008> only standard one like this
[10:26:50] <daniel31> innociv: I'm making something like a spell checker, but for grammar. I'll let you know how it works in a  second..
[10:26:56] <jop008> <link rel="stylesheet" href="../include/jQuery_mobile/jquery.mobile-1.4.2.min.css"/>
[10:27:04] <innociv> ya it should work for that.
[10:27:16] <jop008> But it doesn't
[10:27:26] <BillCriswell> jop008: Is your HTML valid? It's really hard to debug through an image.
[10:27:30] <jop008> Copy the code and put it in a page tag
[10:27:36] <BillCriswell> Can you replicate it on jsfiddle.net?
[10:28:14] <daniel31> innociv: It works perfectly. thank you very much. could i attribute or credit you in some way?
[10:28:36] <innociv> I didn't make the original code. I wrapped someone elses into a jquery function that'd work better
[10:28:43] <innociv> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13949059/persisting-the-changes-of-range-objects-after-selection-in-html is where I found that working code to start with
[10:28:52] <innociv> So I'd just comment a link to that
[10:29:12] <jop008> this is the complete code http://pastebin.com/5NQrBDN2
[10:29:13] <jop008> pretty basic
[10:29:17] <daniel31> well, it's fortunate for me we happaned to be in the channel ath the same time and fortune my javascript browser console was not working lol
[10:29:21] <jop008> No script no css
[10:29:30] <innociv> mhm
[10:32:40] <BillCriswell> jop008: Hm.
[10:32:47] <beaky> hello
[10:32:55] <beaky> how do i refresh a part of a webpage every 1s
[10:33:02] <jop008> fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/80/
[10:33:06] <jop008> same
[10:33:15] <innociv> put an ajax request on a 1000ms setInterval
[10:33:22] <jop008> So the + must be inline with >
[10:33:30] <jop008> to make it an appealing page
[10:34:05] <BillCriswell> I got it to cooperate with a bit of CSS but I'm not sure why I needed to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/xUXX2/
[10:34:38] <jop008> So advice? Put the css in?
[10:35:25] <beaky> how do i make an ajax request
[10:35:48] <beaky> also how do i display multiple webpages on a single one
[10:36:27] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/xUXX2/1/ this is the overrides (?) they use on the site so I guess it's OK to do that without breaking shit elsewhere.
[10:36:41] <jop008> I need some margin around it
[10:37:13] <jop008> Strange that the demo page gives wrong code
[10:37:35] <HRI-Williamson> as still somewhat a JQuery n00b, I just have to say y'all are frigging awesome.
[10:37:57] <HRI-Williamson> The Austin conference was an eye opener.
[10:38:51] <BillCriswell> jop008: Just noticed there's a "CSS" accordion thing.
[10:39:10] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/xUXX2/2/ is the CSS they provide on the site. We just missed it.
[10:39:27] <BillCriswell> How I missed a giant purple bar is beyond me.
[10:39:43] <jop008> thanks fellow
[10:40:08] <jop008> so for all demo stuf you must copy css also?
[10:40:23] <jop008> this was not the case with 132 demo pages
[10:40:39] <jop008> This is my first 142 steps
[10:42:16] <jop008> so for all demo stuf you must copy css also?
[10:42:44] <BillCriswell> jop008: I have no idea. I don't work with jQuery mobile but I don't think they'd put that there for no reason.
[10:43:01] <jop008> make sense
[10:43:20] <jop008> there is no irc for jqm only?
[10:44:05] <BillCriswell> Not sure.
[10:59:40] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I am having trouble making a ajax call to json. I am getting the cross domain error. My code is here http://jsfiddle.net/4vCqW/ I tried adding it to my own server and adding an .htaccess Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" - Can someone point me in the right direction?
[11:01:18] <antlong> Anyone interested in helping out with a sci-fi game? Lots of jquery.
[11:03:01] <markusdbx> Is it ok to use singel quotes in jquery selectors?
[11:03:02] <Cork> d3m0n: that server doesn't set any cors
[11:03:05] <markusdbx> *single
[11:03:18] <Cork> d3m0n: so you can't do cross domain json requests against it
[11:03:27] <Cork> markusdbx: yes
[11:03:39] <Cork> markusdbx: jquery doesn't care
[11:03:48] <Cork> as long as it is a js string
[11:03:57] <d3m0n> I set them on my own server but still got the error
[11:04:04] <d3m0n> Or do you mean the steam server
[11:04:37] <Cork> d3m0n: yes
[11:04:49] <markusdbx> Cork: even if jquery doesn't care is it bad practice in any way at all?
[11:04:53] <Cork> the server you send the request TO is the one that has to allow it
[11:05:10] <Cork> markusdbx: no it isn't bad practice
[11:05:23] <Cork> markusdbx: i basically only use single quite strings in js
[11:05:25] <d3m0n> Why would they have a json api but not allow people to use it?
[11:05:36] <Cork> and has for most of the time i've developed js
[11:05:44] <d3m0n> They even have api docs on it
[11:05:52] <Cork> d3m0n: the api is most likely meant to be used by a backend
[11:06:11] <beaky> how do i make continuous requests as a button is pressed, then when it is released i stop requests
[11:06:23] <markusdbx> Cork: I tend to use single on jquery selectors, since sometimes I have to embed double quote strings in those. On all normal strings I use double.
[11:06:34] <beaky> i assume i can do that with setInterval and clearInterval on the onpress and onrelease?
[11:06:45] <d3m0n> https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetNewsForApp_.28v0002.29
[11:07:16] <Cork> markusdbx: by reason is that i use double quite for html and single quite for js
[11:07:27] <Cork> from when you used js in attributes on the html tags
[11:07:38] <Cork> it has just stuck since then :)
[11:08:18] <Cork> d3m0n: ya, that is meant to be used by a desktop app
[11:08:21] <Cork> or a backend
[11:08:52] <d3m0n> Well that wording is crappy! Steam WEB APi >.<
[11:08:55] <markusdbx> Cork: Yeah I understand. I guess it's not really hard to adapt. I guess I will just try to set coding standards for each project. If some guys want me to do either way I'm fine.
[11:09:23] <Cork> markusdbx: ya, same here
[11:09:34] <markusdbx> Cork: thanks for your answer =)
[11:09:42] <Cork> markusdbx: trying to stick to one string marker helps a little
[11:09:48] <Cork> but it isn't terribly important
[11:10:36] <Cork> d3m0n: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API/Feedback#API_Considerations_for_Web_Developers
[11:10:52] <markusdbx> Cork: yeah not important, and I can't see them making it stricter in the future, since the big web trend is all about going "unstrict". reference: the xhtml2 vs html5 debacle.
[11:11:07] <Cork> d3m0n: specifically the "and the API's acceptable usage policy requires that the API key is not to be shared."
[11:11:25] <d3m0n> The thing is the news part doesnt require a key
[11:11:40] <d3m0n> That's for the players stats and such
[11:12:06] <Cork> d3m0n: ya, but it still points at that the api isn't meant to be used from the browser
[11:12:27] <d3m0n> gahh I swear I've done this before or seen it been done too
[11:12:35] <Cork> markusdbx: ya, there is no chance that they will dropp support for ' or " as a string marker
[11:12:53] <Cork> d3m0n: sure it can, but you need to proxy it
[11:13:03] <Cork> at least for that api
[11:13:49] <markusdbx> Cork: would be fun though =)
[11:16:58] <d3m0n> http://steamcommunity.com/dev
[11:19:23] <d3m0n> Ok
[11:19:29] <d3m0n> I think I got it, you need to register a domain
[11:19:48] <alaing> anyone know a good frontend/web dev job site for the UK?
[11:20:21] <Cork> d3m0n: for the request proxy ya
[11:20:32] <Cork> d3m0n: but you have to implement a proxy
[11:20:51] <d3m0n> I would think that it allows you Cross Domain access
[11:20:58] <Cork> no
[11:21:25] <Cork> the api is designed to not ever be used from the js in the browser
[11:22:03] <Cork> the link i gave you before explicitly states this
[11:57:59] <antlong> Does anyone have input on a nice way to display fight stats, like XX did 10 damage to you.
[11:58:04] <antlong> I'm thinking of using a modal
[11:58:06] <antlong> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[12:09:42] <BillCriswell> antlong: A modal kind of stops you from doing whatever you were doing. Is that a good thing in the situation?
[12:15:32] <duch_kazatel> note to self: monolithic pull requests are the devil,.
[12:16:48] <naeluh_fri> ayeah yeah !
[12:19:37] <antlong> BillCriswell i think so, since you need to heal while fighting
[12:19:39] <antlong> BillCriswell what do you think
[12:20:32] <BillCriswell> antlong: Do you want the user to be able to do something during this time or do they just have to sit there and wait it out?
[12:20:54] <antlong> BillCriswell i think combat would be finished within a couple of seconds, so probably just wait
[12:20:59] <MikeD_> combat damage text is usually just printed over the character's head and it fades out almost immediately
[12:21:13] <antlong> we don't have art for the character
[12:21:53] <MikeD_> oh, a Zork clone then...
[12:22:12] <antlong> we'll have it eventually, but for the next couple of weeks at least, i don't think it'll be implemented
[12:22:23] <BillCriswell> I was thinking just a positioned div at the bottom of the screen that fades out after X seconds or clicked... it really depends on the flow of everything else.
[12:22:44] <MikeD_> how fast-paced is this game?
[12:22:53] <antlong> www.multiverseminer.com
[12:22:58] <antlong> you pace it, i guess
[12:23:15] <DarkStompy> How do I prevent jQuery form automatically loading scripts that are added to the page?
[12:23:47] <BillCriswell> DarkStompy: You could strip them before you add them perhaps.
[12:24:44] <DarkStompy> BillCriswell: The page allows the user to add HTML andscripts that are added are being automatically processed. I want to prevent this.
[12:25:26] <BillCriswell> DarkStompy: You have to sanitize the input.
[12:25:55] <DarkStompy> BillCriswell: Does jQuery have a fuction for this?
[12:26:18] <MikeD_> if it was the kind of real-time beating that a typical RPG incurs, you might want to show damage in the last N seconds... and have it accumulate - perhaps even allowing someone to make triggered responses to thresholds being exceeded
[12:26:19] <BillCriswell> DarkStompy: That's not something you can reliably do client side.
[12:26:48] <MikeD_> DarkStompy: most people are trying to figure out how to _make_ the browser process just-in-time script additions
[12:27:06] <DarkStompy> MikeD_: I know... I am the exception!
[12:38:26] <randomDude000> How do I check if an iframe is from the same domain?
[12:39:12] <duch_kazatel> check the SRC of the iframe and see if it matches the current document.domain
[12:39:28] <duch_kazatel> you'll want to check to make sure the port and protocol are the same, too.
[12:48:31] <BillCriswell> I love when things click after a while.
[12:48:35] <duch_kazatel> the best./
[12:48:40] <duch_kazatel> and suddenly you feel like an expert.
[12:48:45] <CrispyClean> Is there in an issue with window.scrollTo when changing window height? I have a div set to display none… on click it changes to blcok and shows its content so I want it to scroll to the top. I put in setTime out but it just doesn’t work. Any suggestions ??
[12:48:53] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah... and also like a dumb ass cause it didn't click sooner.
[12:49:07] <CrispyClean> ..then the next problem comes up and ur back here askng a real expert :-p
[12:49:25] <BillCriswell> There's something things I'll like... "understand" but won't know how to use properly.
[12:49:40] <BillCriswell> Learned how to use something properly feels right.
[12:50:02] <duch_kazatel> yeah - actually knowing wtf you're doing and being able to reason about it.
[12:50:49] <BillCriswell> http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/ reading through this and really tring to understand things better.
[12:51:43] <duch_kazatel> i was about to ask "which patterns does this discuss".  then i scrolled down.
[12:51:45] <duch_kazatel> that's awesome.
[12:52:42] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: I tried it on google's iframe, it works, on my iframe, I get a blank string.
[12:53:04] <randomDude000> I also tried it on jquery.com's iframes, blank string
[12:53:14] <duch_kazatel> wat.  fiddle up your code.
[12:53:36] <randomDude000> $("iframe").src or $("iframe")[0].src
[12:53:51] <duch_kazatel> .attr('src')
[12:53:55] <duch_kazatel> not .src
[12:54:00] <randomDude000> Hmm okay
[12:54:02] <duch_kazatel> or .prop('src')
[12:54:04] <duch_kazatel> either should work.
[12:54:07] <randomDude000> Okay
[12:55:20] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: Neither work on http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[12:55:53] <duch_kazatel> woah woah woah.
[12:55:54] <duch_kazatel> hold up.
[12:55:55] <randomDude000> Is it just me doing something wrong?
[12:56:01] <duch_kazatel> paste a fiddle and show me what you're trying to do.
[12:56:06] <duch_kazatel> because something isn't clicking here.
[12:56:29] <randomDude000> I just want to know what's the source of an iframe
[12:56:31] <randomDude000> That is all
[12:56:55] <BillCriswell> Those iframes don't have sources?
[12:56:56] <duch_kazatel> $('iframe') - this will get all iframes on a page.
[12:57:04] <randomDude000> I know
[12:57:06] <duch_kazatel> if there's more than one, it returns a collection, so you need to get a specific one.
[12:57:17] <randomDude000> I tried [0]
[12:57:27] <randomDude000> Does this bring up js insttead of jq?
[12:57:32] <randomDude000> js
[12:57:37] <duch_kazatel> that returns the DOM node without the jquery methods attached.
[12:58:04] <randomDude000> So how do I do the thing with jq
[12:58:14] <duch_kazatel> $('iframe').eq(0).attr('src');
[12:58:14] <randomDude000> [0] for ex
[12:58:15] <duch_kazatel> try that.
[12:58:20] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[12:58:20] <randomDude000> Okay
[12:59:33] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: =[ still!
[12:59:35] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: The iframes on that page don't have src attributes, it's weird.
[12:59:36] <randomDude000> I get undifined
[12:59:47] <randomDude000> Oh, that's why
[12:59:55] <BillCriswell> randomDude000: Yes.
[12:59:56] <duch_kazatel> which page?
[12:59:59] <randomDude000> actually it does
[13:00:02] <randomDude000> I see the src attr
[13:00:05] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[13:00:17] <randomDude000> Well, I see it on the dom
[13:00:45] <randomDude000> It's probably generated with jq or js
[13:00:47] <randomDude000> That's why
[13:01:14] <duch_kazatel> right, those are generated as sandboxes to keep them separate from the parent page.
[13:01:14] <BillCriswell> I still don't get how it doesn't have a src attribute.
[13:01:29] <BillCriswell> iframes are weird. SHould get more familiar with them
[13:01:34] <duch_kazatel> it's just a separate document.  you can set the contents to whatever.
[13:01:44] <randomDude000> Oh true..
[13:01:48] <randomDude000> I remember that
[13:01:52] <randomDude000> But forgot for a sec
[13:01:53] <randomDude000> =D
[13:01:54] <randomDude000> Thanks
[13:02:01] <duch_kazatel> this is why i was asking for more specifics about what you're actually trying to do.
[13:02:08] <duch_kazatel> run the examples against YOUR page, not jquery's.
[13:02:14] <randomDude000> kk
[13:02:19] <randomDude000> Yeah, that should suffice
[13:02:21] <randomDude000> =]
[13:06:17] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell what was today's "a-hah" moment?
[13:08:37] <BillCriswell> I forgot that quick.
[13:09:02] <BillCriswell> I'm sure it'll come back to me soon
[13:09:48] <duch_kazatel> http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html - "In the past few months, our indexing system has been rendering a substantial number of web pages more like an average user’s browser with JavaScript turned on."
[13:09:49] <rindolf> Hi all. Can anyone recommend a good jQuery or jQuery UI plugin for a simple way to hide/show a fold? Like .toggleClass or whatever. It's not hard to implement and I did it several times, but I don't want to continue reinventing the wheel.
[13:09:58] <duch_kazatel> "a fold"?
[13:10:09] <Foldager> THE PINGS.
[13:10:09] <duch_kazatel> an accordion you mean?
[13:10:16] * Foldager removes notifications from "fold"
[13:10:20] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[13:10:32] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: not exaclty.
[13:10:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I always kind of assumed it was doing that already. I'm glad they're publicly acknolweding it now.
[13:10:52] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: like a part of a page that I expand or unexpand with a single button.
[13:11:23] <duch_kazatel> rindolf right, an accordion - http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[13:11:30] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/js-fc-solve/text/ - like the Advanced here.
[13:11:31] <duch_kazatel> this can be made to do exactly that.
[13:11:44] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: ah, I think the Accordion was a major complicated thing.
[13:11:49] <duch_kazatel> nope./
[13:11:55] <duch_kazatel> that's an animated version.
[13:12:06] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: what?
[13:12:10] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: animated?
[13:12:14] <rindolf> I don't want animations.
[13:12:24] <rindolf> I'm not into jQuery for the animations.
[13:12:30] <duch_kazatel> then .hide() and .show()
[13:12:39] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: OK.
[13:12:49] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: maybe I'll write my own plugin.
[13:13:03] <duch_kazatel> or use accordion and set animate to false
[13:13:08] <duch_kazatel> which does exactly what you want.
[13:13:14] <BillCriswell> Leaving early. Later.
[13:13:18] <duch_kazatel> peace
[13:13:21] <duch_kazatel> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:14:58] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: thats an odd posture
[13:15:08] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[13:16:34] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: your emoticon
[13:16:45] <duch_kazatel> http://textfac.es/
[13:16:46] <frank_o> its this thing right? http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTiBF6symyud-qg5jssH6NAYaztVatrvugwwyr9T-V6xJjDw1heSA
[13:16:47] <duch_kazatel> enjoy
[13:16:52] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:16:57] <duch_kazatel> the first one on the page i linked.
[13:17:01] <duch_kazatel> it's a shrug.
[13:17:09] <frank_o> haha
[13:17:17] <frank_o> nice nice
[13:17:38] <randomDude000> Hey duch_kazatel, how come on some pages when I do $("iframe") I'm returned the DOM element and not jq method?
[13:17:49] <duch_kazatel> where are you running it from?
[13:17:58] <randomDude000> inspector?
[13:18:02] <duch_kazatel> from chrome?
[13:18:05] <randomDude000> yeah
[13:18:17] <duch_kazatel> if the page doesn't have jquery loaded, chrome shortcuts $ to querySelectorAll
[13:18:27] <randomDude000> Hmmm...
[13:18:29] <randomDude000> Interesting
[13:18:31] <randomDude000> Thanks =D
[13:18:34] <duch_kazatel> yep
[13:28:30] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: so what is the correct way to do that show/close thing? Edit/Close
[13:28:46] <CrispyClean> How can I make it so that when a ‘nav’ item is clicked… it scrolls to it so that it’s on top of page? http://jsfiddle.net/DGGZ/veps7/11/
[13:32:32] <duch_kazatel> "that show/close thing"?
[13:32:51] <StephenS> text == Edit if you remember, however I;ll do it with is visible, so I can avoid localization issues.
[13:33:51] <Cork> CrispyClean: something like $(window).scrollTop($(this).offset().top()); should owrk
[13:33:58] <Cork> *work
[13:34:23] <CrispyClean> thx let me give it a try
[13:47:11] <And1> Hello there. I'm using the following to load a local jquery.js, if CDN is not reachable. Any ideas, how I would check for jquery.mobile.js?
[13:47:15] <And1> <script type="text/javascript">window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/static/js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js" type="text/javascript"><\/script>')</script>
[13:58:24] <CrispyClean> this almost works http://jsfiddle.net/DGGZ/veps7/34/
[14:19:16] <ankurk_> I am trying to use jQuery in Wordpress, but it's not working for some reason, I am using like this, http://jsbin.com/gedinahu/1/
[14:20:00] <HumbleWebDev> are you using jQuery instead of $
[14:21:32] <ankurk_> HumbleWebDev: I have a link to the jsbin
[14:22:18] <zylophone> is there a difference between .val and .prop('value') ?
[14:22:50] <NoiseEee> .val is for inputs
[14:22:57] <NoiseEee> or form elements, more accurately
[14:24:01] <zylophone> but i was reading about prop vs attr, and it suggested that .prop('value') should be used as it's dynamic
[14:24:44] <NoiseEee> no
[14:25:02] <NoiseEee> if you want the current value of a form element, use val()
[14:25:16] <zylophone> ah ok, thanks
[14:26:21] <zylophone> ankurk_: don't put identifiable strings in your paste bins like, uhm, fitting urban ;)
[14:27:23] <ankurk_> zylophone: okay, but why keyup is not working? :(
[14:33:22] <williamtdr> Hi. Using a panel breaks my background image on jQuery mobile. What can I do?
[15:15:34] <Syco54645> anyone ever have document ready not work on some pages but works on others?
[15:15:41] <Syco54645> even in the header
[15:15:47] <duch_kazatel> Syco54645 sure when your page is invalid.
[15:16:01] <Syco54645> duch_kazatel: define invalid
[15:16:09] <Syco54645> i get nothing in the inspector saying that there is an error
[15:16:15] <duch_kazatel> invalid enough that the browser prematurely fires the document ready event.
[15:16:21] <duch_kazatel> invalid per the W3's spec.
[15:16:57] <Syco54645> duch_kazatel: i have an alert in there, i should at least see the alert no?
[15:17:29] <duch_kazatel> dunno, i can't see your code ;)
[15:17:37] <duch_kazatel> mind making a fiddle to isolate the js?
[15:17:45] <Syco54645> well not my code perse
[15:18:04] <duch_kazatel> can i see the code in question?
[15:18:13] <duch_kazatel> via a jsfiddle?
[15:18:28] <Syco54645> duch_kazatel: i honestly dont care, im about to quit my job because of an incompent boss
[15:18:35] <duch_kazatel> uh. okay.
[15:18:38] <duch_kazatel> then why did you ask?
[15:18:40] <Syco54645> i will paste the entire thing, it is mvc though
[15:18:45] <duch_kazatel> please don't.
[15:18:46] <Syco54645> i mean showing you the code ;)
[15:19:01] <Syco54645> well the code in question
[15:19:05] <Syco54645> i am not sure how to isolate it
[15:19:14] <Syco54645> i can show the associated view
[15:19:30] <Syco54645> (i meant i dont mind showing code because i really dont care about the place at this point)
[15:19:59] <duch_kazatel> i don't want to read the entire thing.
[15:20:02] <Syco54645> haha
[15:20:08] <Syco54645> i ddidnt think that you would want to
[15:20:53] <naeluh_fri> hey so am I setting up this touchmove eventlistener corecctly ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/fZkCy/
[15:20:58] <naeluh_fri> cause I am not sure if I am ?
[15:21:12] <Syco54645> duch_kazatel: i guess there is something wrong with this specific view but have no idea, as the code isnt mine
[15:21:31] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_fri why not use .on()?
[15:21:58] <naeluh_fri> duch_kazatel: does that include touchevnts with it ?
[15:22:03] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:22:20] <duch_kazatel> .on() can do binding for any event.
[15:22:43] <naeluh_fri> cause I can get mousemove to work on desktop but when I use it on mobile I drag my finger and... nothing happens
[15:23:12] <duch_kazatel> try binding to $('
[15:23:16] <duch_kazatel> *$('body')
[15:23:26] <naeluh_fri> yeah for sure i didnt know if it bound mobile events and mouse events together in some way
[15:23:28] <duch_kazatel> iirc ios has some funk about binding to body, but i could be wrong.
[15:23:33] <Syco54645> yes to get on to work bind to something higher up than the object
[15:23:35] <Syco54645> body works well
[15:23:49] <naeluh_fri> what about html?
[15:23:57] <duch_kazatel> unnecessary.
[15:23:59] <duch_kazatel> do body.
[15:24:05] <naeluh_fri> ok let me try this
[15:24:12] <naeluh_fri> so dont bind to canvas
[15:24:22] <duch_kazatel> or bind to that element, sure.
[15:24:26] <Syco54645> duch_kazatel: just an fyi our talk helped me approach this differently and i got it working ;)
[15:24:29] <Syco54645> so thanks a million
[15:24:34] <duch_kazatel> Syco54645 sure.
[15:24:38] <duch_kazatel> glad i could be a rubber duck.
[15:24:40] <duch_kazatel> :)
[15:24:48] <naeluh_fri> let me see I am going to .on instead of eventlistener
[15:24:57] <Syco54645> duch_kazatel: rubber duck?

[15:25:15] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[15:27:10] <Syco54645> i am miffed because my car broke down and thus i had no way to get to work, got a nasty email from my boss (who is honestly as stupid as the boss in dilbert) how i need to step up and get serious. when in two months i rewrote an entire site in 2.5 months. it originally took his 4 developers 6 months
[15:27:28] <Syco54645> so obviously he does not value me nor does he understand what i do.
[15:27:58] <HumbleWebDev> I think most developers see this
[15:28:18] <HumbleWebDev> I work with mostly front-end developers or Wordpress developers really
[15:28:26] <Syco54645> HumbleWebDev: yes, and when it happens i leave where ever i am. i dont really care.
[15:28:26] <HumbleWebDev> They dont know what the hell I do
[15:28:28] <Syco54645> ;)
[15:28:47] <Syco54645> HumbleWebDev: what language do you do?
[15:29:22] <HumbleWebDev> LAMP stack
[15:29:49] <Syco54645> i left a place where i was treated correctly but had nothing to do for 6 months. left because i didnt want there to be layoffs. was told by my manager that there would be but it wasnt me and i was always welcome back if i left
[15:29:58] <Syco54645> so i contacted him today ;)
[15:30:03] <HumbleWebDev> Some Python and Ruby
[15:30:09] <Syco54645> yeah i do lamp stack mostly as well
[15:30:27] <Syco54645> was getting into .net somewhere but holy cow no thanks
[15:30:42] <HumbleWebDev> Im doing mostly Zend Framework Applications right now
[15:30:47] <Syco54645> currently doing codeigniter and symfony2
[15:30:53] <HumbleWebDev> Nice
[15:30:54] <Syco54645> more ci than symfony
[15:31:12] <HumbleWebDev> I did cakephp for a little bit
[15:31:17] <Syco54645> i never did anything zend related.
[15:31:19] <HumbleWebDev> Im curious about laravel
[15:31:31] <rasu2> Hello i have a big form. And when the user change a value in the form i want a div to pop up at the side with the text you have note saved. This works great in every browser but not in IE. when i use the tab key to change textbox and the site scrolls the div dissapears until i scroll with the mouse. the div is fixed at right:0 and top :0 anybody knows why?
[15:31:35] <Syco54645> did you enjoy cake? people always talk down about it where i am at
[15:31:54] <Syco54645> i too am interested in laravel. been requesting we do a project in it
[15:32:00] <HumbleWebDev> Im no longer using it!
[15:32:28] <Syco54645> my boss (the owner as well) read the statement from ellislabs about ci and said "they said it is dead, we can no longer use it!!!"
[15:32:29] <HumbleWebDev> Laravel seems to be popular in my php meetup group
[15:32:49] <Syco54645> yes, laravel is extremely popular with my group as well
[15:32:55] <Syco54645> then ci then symfony
[15:33:02] <tw2113> i've heard of laravel, haven't bothered at all yet
[15:33:06] <Syco54645> symfony is very confusing
[15:33:51] <tw2113> i installed Yii a couple nights ago
[15:33:56] <tw2113> just to check it out
[15:33:57] <HumbleWebDev> Anyone a yii guy
[15:34:09] <Syco54645> i have not even heard of yii
[15:34:09] <Syco54645> haha
[15:34:16] <HumbleWebDev> I think yii users are a dying breed
[15:34:17] <tw2113> i tried changing permalink stuff and it was breaking for me
[15:34:34] <HumbleWebDev> Thats awesome
[15:34:43] <HumbleWebDev> I really like the Zend framework
[15:35:13] <Syco54645> i really like CI ;)
[15:35:15] <HumbleWebDev> A very active group of developers contributing
[15:35:16] <tw2113> apparently i'm not putting urlManager in the right spot
[15:35:37] <HumbleWebDev> ZF3 is in the works
[15:36:41] <Syco54645> duch_kazatel: what happened to you and i just now happens daily for me and the other devs
[15:36:53] <Syco54645> they will ask a question and i go stand behind them and it just works ;)
[15:37:10] <Syco54645> happens for when i ask them all the time too
[15:37:20] <tw2113> sounds like my dad and handyman maintenance
[15:37:30] <Syco54645> ha
[15:37:34] <tw2113> grandma had dishwasher troubles, dad showed up and it suddenly started working
[15:37:50] <Syco54645> happens to me with my parents and their computers
[15:38:48] <naeluh_fri> duch_kazatel: something like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/fZkCy/1/
[15:39:38] <Syco54645> naeluh_fri: i think you have successfully programmed an acid trip
[15:39:39] <Syco54645> thanks!
[15:40:16] <naeluh_fri> Syco54645: now if i can get it to run on my phone haha
[15:41:30] <Syco54645> ha
[15:41:35] <Syco54645> that is the fun part i suppose
[15:42:13] <BrownMountain> i installed osx maverik

[16:40:11] <legrandin> the first dom function works fine, the second does not
[16:40:17] <naeluh_fri> legrandin: I can get this to work properly in mobile broswer my touch event is all fucked

[16:40:32] <naeluh_fri> I can't*
[16:40:59] <legrandin> yeah i dont think i can help you lol
[16:41:14] <naeluh_fri> its cool no prob!
[16:41:19] <legrandin> i mostly use django, and jquery for the ajax stuff
[16:41:29] <naeluh_fri> ajax>?
[16:41:33] <naeluh_fri> ajax
[16:41:35] <legrandin> uh yeah
[16:41:48] <legrandin> asyncronous javascript posting
[16:41:54] <naeluh_fri> I dont have any ajax in ther e?
[16:42:28] <legrandin> lol i wasnt saying you were :D
[16:42:36] <naeluh_fri> oh haha
[16:43:41] <legrandin> so can you take a stab at my problem? :D
[16:45:56] <legrandin> basically i need to uncheck and disable all the boxes what have been sent
[16:46:09] <legrandin> so the data doesn't get submitted again
[16:46:43] <uskerine> hi
[16:46:59] <legrandin> hello
[16:47:22] <uskerine> Could someone give the basic guidelines on how to hide/show a whole div/area depending on a input type="checkbox" status? Thanks
[16:48:48] <duch_kazatel> uskerine $('input').on('change', function() { $('div').hide() });
[16:49:22] <innociv> http://pastebin.com/Q2HiULTj  I don't understand why I'm getting this error
[16:49:34] <duch_kazatel> uskerine if you want to hide/show based on the status, $('input').on('change', function() { $(this).prop('checked') }); - that prop will tell you if the box is checked or not.
[16:49:58] <uskerine> thanks, i will investigate further with that
[16:52:03] <duch_kazatel> innociv you're probably feeding your function a value with the wrong type.
[16:52:17] <innociv> er which function, where how?
[16:52:43] <duch_kazatel> dunno -this doesn't seem like it contains everything.
[16:53:16] <innociv> Ohh I see now
[16:53:22] <innociv> a map was returning undefined
[16:53:27] <duch_kazatel> that'd do it.
[16:55:58] <innociv> Eh does underscore not have an irc?
[16:56:11] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:56:41] <innociv> underscore.js
[16:56:47] <duch_kazatel> oh you want #documentcloud
[16:57:42] <tw2113> yeah, from what i recall, they go through the IRC for the parent company or something
[16:57:49] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:57:57] <duch_kazatel> same channel for backbone, underscore, and coffeescript iirc.
[16:58:01] <duch_kazatel> since it's the same dude.
[16:58:11] <tw2113> no wonder backbone and underscores are so coupled
[16:58:21] <tw2113> also why their websites look the same
[16:58:43] <duch_kazatel> :)
[16:58:44] <duch_kazatel> yep
[16:59:03] <tw2113> and both use the same color scheme
[16:59:07] <tw2113> #conspiracy
[16:59:55] <tw2113> i was just getting done going through http://arturadib.com/hello-backbonejs/ to be honest :D
[17:00:32] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I go home.
[17:00:42] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks.  and tip your bartender.

[17:14:54] <jaspertheghost> but it get an error back .. returns .fail
[17:14:59] <jaspertheghost> and or won't return the data
[17:31:25] <uskerine> duch_kazatel, should i enclose $('input').on('change', function() { alert "Here we go" });
[17:31:33] <uskerine> into anyething?
[17:31:35] <uskerine> anything*
[17:32:02] <uskerine> i have replaced input by #myInputId
[17:32:08] <uskerine> where input has id="myInputId"
[17:38:59] <wewillc> I'm getting weird behavior with the <audio> tag when I $().load() in a page. Sounds like it is repeating and I get an echo affect. Any thoughts on prevention?
[17:49:30] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/C7uJP8Pv
[17:49:51] <uskerine> does anyone see something wrong in this block hide/show based on input checkbox?
[17:50:04] <uskerine> it always go to else "3"
[17:51:29] <xackery> if ($('#useBillingForShip:checked').val()) { ... }
[17:52:48] <uskerine> thanks xackery
[17:53:00] <uskerine> why was going always through the else branch?
[17:55:03] <xackery> alert($('this').prop('checked')); //debug what this is showing. if nothing, do alert($('this')) and see what it results in. etc.
[17:55:30] <xackery> I normally use console.log() over alert() when debugging. Or if available, I use chrome's console for instant debugging (or breakpoints).
[17:55:56] <xackery> since console.log() does an object dump when you follow my alert steps above.
[17:57:14] <uskerine> ok thanks

[18:38:05] <jaspertheghost> how can i apply css to dynamically added elements?
[18:38:11] <jaspertheghost> without knowing the class names of everything
[18:38:14] <jaspertheghost> I'm using jqeury movile...

[18:43:49] <trewq> I am using bootstrap 3 and working on setting the height of a div through jquery (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23839547/matching-column-height-in-bootstrap-3 ).. I am making good progress - Is there a way to make the jquery run only for Large devices and Medium devices? I want to use bootstrap variables, and not hardcode a width
[18:44:53] <jaspertheghost> i think thats what lg-col is for
[18:44:55] <jaspertheghost> and the other one*
[18:45:01] <jaspertheghost> sm = small lg= large
[18:45:13] <jaspertheghost> and md
[18:45:19] <jaspertheghost> when u specify the class's
[18:47:04] <trewq> jaspertheghost: yes.. -lg- and -md- is that css rules for that device.. But I want to be able to detect which of these -lg- or -md- rules are in effect (and do not want to do if width <  800 etc)
[18:48:18] <jaspertheghost> probably javascript
[18:48:35] <jaspertheghost> window.screen.availHeight
[18:49:04] <jaspertheghost> and then updating the elements css style
[18:50:20] <trewq> jaspertheghost: I know how to find the current width, but bootstrap already has these rules (width rules) set.. I want to use jquery to detect these rules.. I had updated the SO question to provide more details
[18:50:32] <trewq> I appreciate your assistance
[18:51:17] <trewq> ahh.. How to detect which device view you're on using Twitter Bootstrap API?? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14441456/how-to-detect-which-device-view-youre-on-using-twitter-bootstrap-api
[18:51:39] <trewq> that might be what I am looking for... investigating..
[19:43:01] <Vivekananda> how can I do  $(this) > .myelement     then toggle  'myelement' in jquery
[19:43:26] <Vivekananda> I know that I can do  $(this).siblings('.myelement').slideToggle() ;
[19:43:50] <Vivekananda> but I wanted to know if there is a better/ more efficient way of doing this
[19:56:47] <Vivekananda>   how can I do  $(this) > .myelement     then toggle  'myelement' in jquery  .  I know that I can do  $(this).siblings('.myelement').slideToggle() ;  http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/T3Fdk/
[19:58:48] <acidjazz> Vivekananda: $(this).find(' .myelement')
[20:12:00] <Vivekananda> acidjazz: thanks. I was just wondering if there is a way to use 'this' and '>'  and do the same thing
[20:13:56] <RNT> hi guys, can you help me with this please: http://jsfiddle.net/diflori/y7dyA/ ?
[20:25:55] <acidjazz> Vivekananda: $(this).find('> .class');

[20:26:32] <acidjazz> lol
[20:30:00] <marisa_reddy12> I'm a bit of a beginner here. Could someone on this screen explain to me how I could use jquery in my node.js app to update a clock that I'm trying to display on my webpage? My code is here: https://github.com/bornreddy/uamod.
[20:30:37] <marisa_reddy12> For context - I'm working in routes/index.js and I want prettyTime to update on my webpage every second.
[20:39:36] <Vivekananda> acidjazz: lol
[20:39:38] <Vivekananda> hahaha nice
[20:39:55] <frank_o> How do I initialize this cool mobile panel lib with jQuery instead of plain JS? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/5X4K9/13/
[20:40:16] <Vivekananda> frank_o: click on it ?
[20:41:11] <frank_o> Vivekananda: sorry?
[20:41:39] <frank_o> you can see I've attempted to translate the plain JS into jQuery at the bottom of that fiddle but I'm missing something
[20:41:46] <Vivekananda> I mean if the library is there on offer from jsfiddle couldnt you just check it and it will be in cluded. Look to the left top for includes
[20:42:30] <frank_o> No the lib itself is included, I'm just trying to initialize it with jQuery instead of plain JS
[20:42:46] <Vivekananda> franckbenoit: check out http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/5X4K9/14/
[20:42:51] <Vivekananda> is that what you wnat ?
[20:43:08] <frank_o> oops wrong frank there lol
[20:43:29] <frank_o> Vivekananda: no
[20:43:51] <Vivekananda> oo okay
[20:43:56] <frank_o> Vivekananda: look in the JavaScript window of that fiddle -- the code that is there needs to be translated from plain JS to jQuery
[20:45:32] <Vivekananda> looking
[20:45:47] <Vivekananda> I am new at this too so trying to figure out what you mean :)
[20:46:09] <frank_o> "porting" it from vanilla JS to jQuery is probably the correct term for it :)
[20:54:12] <fizzle> hello :D
[20:54:49] <frank_o> Vivekananda: http://jsfiddle.net/jakecigar/5X4K9/15/
[21:14:21] <naeluh>  anyone have any ideas why this so slow ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/Q6CZw/9/
[21:30:43] <afroradiohead> is there a way to listen to all events on an element
[21:30:51] <afroradiohead> like element.on("*")
[21:33:56] <naeluh> afroradiohead: $('body')
[21:34:10] <naeluh> its the whole thing
[21:34:32] <naeluh> or what are you doing?
[21:35:19] <afroradiohead> i mean all events, like element.on("click mousedown mouseup etc")
[21:36:23] <naeluh> loop thru all events in your js
[21:36:31] <naeluh> do you have code
[21:36:50] <afroradiohead> elem.droppable(config).on("dropactivate dropcreate dropdeactivate drop dropout dropover");
[21:36:59] <afroradiohead> imma just do that, since all i need is the droppable events
[21:37:44] <naeluh> but then are you going to do a callback on that ?
[21:37:54] <afroradiohead> yeah for sure
[21:38:02] <naeluh> ok
[21:39:36] <frank_o> Anybody know if there's a way to use Snap.js (http://jakiestfu.github.io/Snap.js) with jQuery Mobile? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/vZBzD/4/
[22:35:59] <frank_o> How does the default Snap.js demo manage to make both the left and the right panel the same? http://jakiestfu.github.io/Snap.js/demo/apps/default.html
[22:36:02] <frank_o> My right panel is empty: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/5X4K9/11/
[22:36:22] <acidjazz> do i go get beers or work on my personal project at home
[22:37:27] <acidjazz> frank_o: i woudl steer clear from snap.js
[22:50:39] <frank_o> acidjazz: why do you say that?
[22:51:01] <acidjazz> its really heavy
[22:51:06] <acidjazz> really cpu heavy
[22:51:17] <acidjazz> you can accomplish the same effect w/ a simple class swap
[22:51:22] <acidjazz> and a translate()
[22:51:57] <frank_o> meh
[22:52:03] <frank_o> :)
[22:52:55] <frank_o> seems way lighter than jqm's panel widget which is what i previously used
[22:53:19] <frank_o> was a hell to customize, and no real way to make mobile scrolling work
[22:53:30] <frank_o> snap.js though seems like a godsend
[22:59:02] <frank_o> acidjazz: do you have any fiddles of said class swap?
[22:59:30] <frank_o> or know of any github alternatives to snapjs
[23:00:03] <acidjazz> yea
[23:00:03] <acidjazz> sure
[23:00:05] <acidjazz> uhm
[23:00:09] <acidjazz> well take a div
[23:00:13] <acidjazz> position fix it
[23:00:15] <acidjazz> top 0 left 0
[23:00:22] <acidjazz> then move it over to the left
[23:00:34] <acidjazz> transform: trnanslate(-100%, 0)
[23:00:40] <acidjazz> then make a class taht swipes it back
[23:00:50] <acidjazz> transform: translate(0,0)
[23:00:54] <acidjazz> add a transition to taht
[23:01:05] <acidjazz> and you got yourself a div that swipes left and right based on .switchClass()
[23:03:26] <frank_o> nice
[23:07:52] <xniz> hi acidjazz
[23:11:20] <frank_o> acidjazz: too much work i reckon
[23:11:44] <frank_o> esp with the flick support, user intents and dragging, plus there's a nice support community around it
[23:14:15] <frank_o> and theres no way im going back to android webkit patching
[23:15:04] <xniz> pfft im so confused right now lol
