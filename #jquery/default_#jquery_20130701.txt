[00:00:11] <innociv_> Yes
[00:00:53] <titii> innociv_: ok, but now i dont know where to do that unbind, or how? can u send me some example?
[00:01:15] <innociv_> similar to how the liquidcarousel function is done
[00:01:23] <innociv_> Just add it in with the plugin
[00:07:34] <titii> innociv_: and when in the plugin is this event: $(window).resize(function(e){ ... how to unbind that?
[00:07:54] <ravenzz> $(window).off('resize')
[00:08:10] <innociv_> I think you can .bind('resize.namespace') or something like that then unbind. I forget.
[00:08:10] <ravenzz> resize is an alias for on('resize')
[00:11:35] <titii> ? again pls :) how to adapt this event $(window).resize(function(e){ .. to unbind then?
[00:12:54] <ravenzz> ...
[00:13:27] * ravenzz slaps titii around a bit with a large trout
[00:17:21] <titii> ravenzz: because i can have many window resize events, so when i used to $(window).off('resize'), so i delete all resize events?
[00:17:30] <ravenzz> yes
[00:17:37] <ravenzz> you can namespace your evenets
[00:17:39] <ravenzz> -e
[00:18:23] <Nancy2012> i m changing the URL of hyperlink on each ajax success like this ( $('#sucess_'+hotelId+' > a').attr('href', 'http://www.example.com' ); ) .. but it wouldnt seem working… any idea why?
[00:18:39] <Nancy2012>  $('#sucess_'+hotelId+' > a').attr('href', http://example.com );
[00:18:48] <ravenzz> titii http://api.jquery.com/on/#event-names
[00:20:11] <ravenzz> Nancy2012 the new value has to be in quotes
[00:20:24] <Nancy2012> ok.. let me try it
[00:20:26] <Nancy2012> thanks
[00:20:26] <ravenzz> .attr('href', 'http://example.com');
[00:20:31] <Nancy2012> sure.. :)
[00:20:41] <ravenzz> but I guess that's not your issue
[00:21:30] <titii> ravenzz: so i need to change this $(window).resize(function(e){ into this: $(window).bind("resize.container", function() { .. ?
[00:21:46] <ravenzz> yes but use on() instead of bind()
[00:22:14] <ravenzz> resize.namespaceKittens
[00:22:34] <ravenzz> so later you can unbind with .off("resize.container")
[00:22:56] <titii> what means resize.namespaceKittens ?
[00:24:26] <Nancy2012> i tried with this.. $('#sucess_'+hotelId+' > a').attr('href', " "+rponse+" ");  but it also doesnt work :(
[00:24:55] <ravenzz> oh no if rponse is a variable you don't need to put it in quotes
[00:25:29] <ravenzz> Nancy2012 it could be a selection issue
[00:25:46] <ravenzz> can you make a testcase on jsfiddle.net ?
[00:25:59] <Nancy2012> r u asking to me?
[00:26:15] <Nancy2012> ok.. sure.. i show u ..
[00:26:17] <ravenzz> yes
[00:26:38] <ravenzz> titii nothin another example of namespaced event
[00:26:40] <titii> ravenzz: thank u man
[00:26:47] <ravenzz> yw
[00:26:48] <titii> ravenzz: yes :)
[00:28:26] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/Zx6nA/
[00:29:03] <Nancy2012> i didnt paste all my code here.. just that needed part which changes the a href URL and ajax post
[00:31:40] <Nancy2012> what wrong that i did.. becoz of it doesnt seem work?
[00:40:38] <ravenzz> Nancy2012 hold on a sec
[00:40:44] <Nancy2012> sure..
[00:43:28] <ravenzz> Nancy2012 what is the output of console.log($('#sucess_'+actionusId+' > a').length) ?
[00:43:31] <crab> boytoy: was that some kind of joke? ajax-chosen is nothing like the form plugin.
[00:44:01] <crab> boytoy: but thanks anyway.
[00:44:02] <okdamn> hey can you suggest me some cool mouseover effect?
[00:44:07] <okdamn> somenthing not ordinary :P !?
[00:45:19] <Nancy2012> it returns o
[00:45:23] <Nancy2012> 0
[00:46:14] <crab> that means your selector is wrong.
[00:46:24] <crab> or rather, that it doesn't select what you want.
[00:46:30] <ravenzz> yeah
[00:47:03] <ravenzz> try to log actionusId too
[00:47:23] <Nancy2012> as u can see… there is <div> and under this div , i have a href link.
[00:47:27] <ravenzz> just to be sure that its value is correct
[00:47:32] <Nancy2012> so whats wrong with it
[00:48:49] <pingo> What is the most performant way to bind the same click event handler to all 250 tr elements of a table ?
[00:49:09] <ravenzz> pingo event delegation
[00:49:32] <ravenzz> $('table').on('click', 'tr', function () {})
[00:50:10] <ravenzz> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[00:50:51] <pingo> thanks I'll go read
[00:52:03] <pingo> right now I have $('tr').on('click', 'a', function () {}) so I should make it $('table').on('click', 'tr>a', function () {}) ?
[00:52:18] <ravenzz> yeah
[00:52:25] <ravenzz> well
[00:52:32] <ravenzz> $('table').on('click', 'tr a', function () {})
[00:52:45] <ravenzz> since the original one is just 'a'
[00:53:08] <pingo> alright
[00:53:15] <pingo> jquery is so smart
[00:53:58] <crab> yep. that delegation stuff is brilliant.
[00:54:02] <pingo> So amazing how you can omit some parameters and it will still work
[00:54:12] <pingo> when calling jquery functions
[00:55:24] <pingo> .on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler(eventObject) )
[00:55:44] <pingo> Does that mean I can skip either "slector" or "data" or even both of them?
[00:57:08] <crab> yes.
[00:57:13] <pingo> thank you
[01:08:15] <pingo> Is there a similar function to closest() but that traverses downwards?
[01:09:39] <seutje> pingo: not really the same, but I guess u'd have to .find().first()
[01:10:27] <seutje> the logic wouldn't really apply downwards, because then if u have 2 siblings that match, which is the closest?
[01:11:27] <amitprakash> Hi, what would be a good way to append a row to a table from data via an array
[01:12:09] <amitprakash> Is there a better way than creating the html tags yourself? ie. <tr><td>arr[0]</td>...</tr> since I want to avoid putting html inside my js
[01:15:20] <pingo> seutje turns out I already implemented this at one point in the past lol
[01:15:21] <pingo> http://pastebin.com/j83UgVZD
[01:15:54] <_Mounir_> hi guys, can someone help me plz , i want to check with an ajax if the user entered the right username, if so it grab the right picture from the database and display it http://paste.laravel.com/zea
[01:15:59] <_Mounir_> can someone help plz on that code ?
[01:16:01] <seutje> pingo: oh, ok, so you return all siblings at the same level
[01:16:05] <_Mounir_> i'm struggeling
[01:16:22] <pingo> yep
[01:17:38] <pingo> Is there a difference between $.proxy() and js's .bind() ?
[01:18:07] <yaso> anyone up for quick helps, i have little problem with this part of my code http://pastebin.com/1PbV6DmD . i need that a href link to open only whats in captionText, tho for some reason it opens localpath and the captionText in the end of that.
[01:21:02] <_Mounir_> any help plz ? i'm new to the jquery domain
[01:32:21] <ole`01> _Mounir_, what's wrong with your code?
[01:33:03] <ole`01> Fyi: The change-event is fired when the input field loses focus!
[01:36:38] <icjs> would people here say that one must learn javascript first before getting the most out of jquery?
[01:37:30] <yaso> anyone up for quick helps, i have little problem with this part of my code http://pastebin.com/1PbV6DmD . i need that a href link to open only whats in captionText, tho for some reason it opens localpath and the captionText in the end of that.
[01:37:37] <_Mounir_> ole`01: hi ole`01 , the problem with my code is it's hard coded
[01:38:17] <_Mounir_> ole`01: i want to make it dynamic, so as soon as the user tab out of username it display his avatar / picture
[01:39:25] <ole`01> _Mounir_, best choice will be AJAX
[01:40:14] <seutje> _Mounir_: http://paste.laravel.com/zer assuming ur using a php script and without any error handling
[01:40:51] <seutje> also assuming you return JSON in the form of { img: 'url/to/image.png' }
[01:42:08] <_Mounir_> seutje: going to test that right now :)
[01:42:41] <seutje> yaso: prepend '//' to the captiontext
[01:43:10] <seutje> otherwise it's going to be relative to the page's url or the root of the server
[01:43:19] <seutje> s/server/domain
[01:44:29] <seutje> icjs: yes, but these days the landscape isn't so wild anymore, so you don't really need jQuery anymore just to navigate through it without losing your sanity
[01:44:47] <seutje> back in the IE6 days, that was not the case
[01:45:20] <_Mounir_> seutje: quick question , what is src in line 13? what is its reference ?
[01:45:35] <icjs> seutje, sorry didnt quite understand - don't need jquery anymore?
[01:45:52] <seutje> _Mounir_: the data.img?
[01:46:24] <_Mounir_> yes
[01:46:39] <seutje> _Mounir_: the first argument to the success handler of an ajax() call is the data returned from the server, I'm just assuming you're returning an object with a url in the form of a string on the the key 'img'
[01:46:54] <_Mounir_> i have  a column called bodyshot in my database, so the right syntax is data.bodyshot right ?
[01:47:15] <_Mounir_> ok
[01:47:43] <seutje> icjs: pretty much, it's still convenient for animations and such though
[01:48:05] <seutje> _Mounir_: well, you still need a server-side script to fetch it from the database and server it in some manner
[01:48:31] <seutje> you don't need to use the same name as the table in the DB
[01:49:38] <_Mounir_> ok , seutje, i'm using laravel 4, and i used json to fetch all data of my users
[01:49:48] <seutje> `g laravel 4
[01:49:59] <seutje> bot? :(
[01:50:03] <seutje> ?g laravel 4
[01:50:45] <seutje> yeah, I'm no PHP hero
[01:51:26] <_Mounir_> thx for your help seutje :)
[02:40:38] <intellix> I'm using jQuery UI Widget factory and am binding on $(window).resize() to do something within my widget… I'm calling destroy on the widget but believe the resize binding is still there… is there a way for me to unbind particular instances of the binding?
[02:42:44] <grafi> intellix maybe look into namespaced events
[02:43:23] <intellix> ah right awesome. so I can do something.myPluginname and then unbind by thta
[02:43:42] <grafi> jup
[02:44:08] <grafi> pretty dandy handy :P
[02:59:26] <ph88> is it common that a jquery ajax request sends a similar format of data as a regular html form post would send ?
[02:59:56] <seutje> intellix: if you ahve a reference to the handler u can pass it with .off() and it'll unbind just that one if it is bound
[03:00:19] <intellix> cool, thanks
[03:00:24] <seutje> ph88: yeah, just .serialize() the form and stick it in the data argument
[03:00:55] <seutje> like $.ajax({ data: $('#myform').serialize(), ... });
[03:01:22] <seutje> that'll turn them into query parameters, like a regular form post
[03:01:25] <soee> hi, if i have var data = form.serializeArray(); how can i add extra element to this array ?
[03:02:29] <ph88> seutje:  hhmm interesting ^^ that would mean i can validate it as if it was a normal form on the server side ^^
[03:03:46] <ph88> seutje: it it possible without a form html tag ?  ... because i'm worried that my layout would have nested form html tags if i use form all the time. Perhaps i can compose the same format from a bunch of input elements ?
[03:03:58] <seutje> soee: data.push({ name:formElement.name, value: formElement.value }); ?
[03:04:23] <seutje> ph88: probably, but I haven't tried that myself
[03:06:08] <ph88> thx seutje
[03:07:27] <seutje> ph88: actually, serialize uses $.param internally, which would probably be a better fit: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[03:09:29] <soee> seutje, i also found push method, but this gives me undefines item
[03:10:01] <seutje> soee: sry, wat?
[03:10:17] <soee> seutje, <seutje> soee: data.push({ name:formElement.name, value: formElement.value }); ?
[03:10:29] <seutje> the formElement variables I used are suppose to be replace with the actual form elements
[03:10:49] <soee> seutje, i want to push some extra data not related to form
[03:11:02] <seutje> so push it
[03:11:28] <seutje> data.push({some: 'thing'});
[04:07:35] <gathala> Hi ahll
[04:08:34] <gathala> I have updated my jquery version from 1.4 to 1.9 and now i have a problem with jquery function  "attr('checked')" for checkbox
[04:08:39] <gathala> please help me
[04:10:07] <gathala> after googling  I got that this is deprecated function by jquery it selp .
[04:10:08] <clu3> Hello all, how do i make a popup when a text is selected like this page https://medium.com/how-to-use-the-internet/fb9f44469f92
[04:10:10] <seutje> ?g jquery attr vs prop
[04:10:13] <bot-t> seutje, javascript - jQuery attr vs prop? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13247058/jquery-attr-vs-prop
[04:10:17] <clu3> does anyone know of the plugin's name?
[04:10:59] <seutje> hmm, ton of poor resources
[04:11:17] <seutje> gathala: basically, you are trying to change or check the property, not the attribute
[04:11:25] <seutje> the attribute is just a way to trigger the property
[04:11:33] <seutje> (checkboxes are kind of an exception)
[04:11:51] <seutje> well, most boolean props are
[04:12:06] <seutje> so just swap them out for prop for checkboxes
[04:12:55] <seutje> gathala: see http://api.jquery.com/prop/#entry-longdesc
[04:13:43] <gathala> seutje : thanks
[04:13:54] <gathala> i have got the solution :)
[04:14:22] <seutje> gathala: you should probably read that bit on the prop() api page, just so u understand why
[04:17:33] <cods> Is there a proper way to do: foo.find("[name="+name+"]") ? I mean, a simple alternative to avoid any problem with character that `name' could contain.
[04:18:12] <cods> (other than doing the filtering myself by querying all the descendants..)
[04:21:46] <clu3> anyone have the solution to my problem?
[04:22:32] <sammich> okay, what do you guys use to delimit a string literal? I know the jQuery family of sites use the double quote. What do you use and why?
[04:22:38] <sammich> denote*
[04:22:52] <sammich> *whatever the word I'm looking for*
[04:24:16] <sammich> I use the single quote because I write HTML with double quotes. And I won't have to escape strings with HTML in them
[04:27:03] <sebsen> hi, want do call a function which is in A.js in a module, from B.js
[04:27:31] <sebsen> can anyone say me why it says me it cant find the module?
[04:29:00] <sammich> is it in scope?
[04:29:54] <sebsen> yes
[04:30:20] <seutje> sammich: u mean like 'foo' vs "foo" ?
[04:30:27] <sammich> seutje: yeah
[04:30:45] <seutje> sammich: I generally never use double quotes except when I'm typing literal markup
[04:30:59] <seutje> like $('<a href="lalalala">foo</a>')
[04:31:04] <sammich> yes, thank you
[04:31:20] <seutje> sammich: except if for some fucked-up reason I really need a line-break in my string
[04:31:23] <sammich> just wanted to say that it bugs me whenever I copy code from jQUery examples
[04:31:30] <seutje> like var foo = "lalalal\n"
[04:31:44] <sfdcNoob> ?p @ sebsen
[04:31:45] <bot-t> sebsen, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:31:46] <seutje> me too, me too :)
[04:32:05] <lucasbonomi> Hi, I'm currently develop a website, that need to have an HD vides as background, but the video that customer gave me have sound, is it possible to play the video as background, but not the sound of the video ?
[04:32:17] <sammich> I made a macro to convert doubles to single
[04:32:26] <sammich> I think np++ has one to swap
[04:33:09] <sammich> and I die a little inside when my colleages use double quotes
[04:33:16] <sammich> but that's just me, I'm a little anal
[04:33:43] <sammich> lucasbonomi: how are you playing the video?
[04:34:11] <sammich> seutje: does the line break char need double?
[04:34:25] <seutje> sammich: yes, I do believe so
[04:34:35] * sammich tests
[04:35:24] <CrysAk> hihihi!
[04:35:29] <CrysAk> got a question for you guys (easy one..)
[04:35:31] <seutje> sammich: this is not to break up a string over multiple lines, but rather to insert a literal linebreak character into the string
[04:35:32] <lucasbonomi> sammich: I use a JqueryvideoBackgroun plugin (jquery.videoBG)
[04:35:45] <CrysAk> how do i ensure that the following jquery does not re-trigger untill it has been completed http://pastie.org/private/tg8ywilx2wijejxos31sq#76,82
[04:35:52] <sammich> yeah, I understand
[04:35:59] <lucasbonomi> sammich: BTW, I found these lines, but it only pause the video :/
[04:36:00] <lucasbonomi>        var song = document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0];
[04:36:00] <lucasbonomi>        if (song.paused)
[04:36:00] <lucasbonomi>            song.play();
[04:36:00] <lucasbonomi>        else
[04:36:00] <lucasbonomi>            song.play();
[04:36:13] <sebsen> can anyone say me why it says me it cant find the module?
[04:36:13] <sebsen> http://jsfiddle.net/uRSvn/
[04:36:29] <sammich> seutje: hmm, do you have an example that shows the difference?
[04:36:39] <sebsen> hi, want do call a function which is in A.js in a module, from B.js
[04:36:46] <seutje> sammich: you almost never need this, due to HTML's inherent indifference for linebreaks
[04:37:17] <sammich> well, lets hope I don't run into this and waste hours on it ;)
[04:37:42] <seutje> sammich: http://pastebin.com/Gcq3732B
[04:38:01] <seutje> first one, the string doesn't actually contain a linebreak, it only appears in the code and is ignored by the parser
[04:38:10] <seutje> second one puts a linebreak character in the string
[04:38:52] <sammich> ahh
[04:39:02] <seutje> php does something similar, but they go as far as to evaluate variables in double-quoted strings
[04:39:05] <seutje> like print
[04:39:09] <sammich> gotcha, I think we used that for building HTML in our JSPs
[04:39:15] <seutje> like print "$foo"; actually prints the value of $foo :x
[04:39:30] <seutje> which is terribly confusing imo
[04:39:34] <lucasbonomi> sammich: Ok, I found a solution, I put my Video html tag with the attr 'muted'
[04:39:51] <sammich> glad you got that sorted :)
[04:40:05] <seutje> like $foo = 'lalala'; $foobar = 'nenenene'; print "$foobar"; // Which var will it actually print?
[04:40:07] <lucasbonomi> Sorry for bothering
[04:40:56] <sammich> seutje: really? the token isn't the whole word?
[04:41:37] <seutje> you could do print "lalalal ppooo peee $foolalala $foobarksjfsd"; and it'll try to parse things it recognizes as a variable
[04:41:50] <seutje> get undefined warnings thrown left an right, probably
[04:41:51] <sysdef> seutje: it will print $foobar in most languages, btw. it looks like perl or php
[04:42:00] <seutje> talking about php
[04:42:16] <sammich> so if you had $ab, $abc, $abcd and print "$ab"?
[04:42:19] <sysdef> there is a #php channel
[04:42:34] <sammich> wait
[04:42:43] <sammich> bad example
[04:42:55] <sammich> no, wait, that's right
[04:43:05] <seutje> sysdef: actually, it's ##php, I believe
[04:43:53] <sebsen> can anyone help me? i want to call a function which is in another file but firebug says me it cant find the function http://jsfiddle.net/uRSvn/
[04:43:53] <seutje> sammich: yeah, it tries to match up to the next whitespace character, but point is, shit's confusing (and believe it or not, faster than string concatenation in some situations...)
[04:44:25] <sysdef> seutje: yes, but it makes no difference because of the forward
[04:44:26] <seutje> sebsen: is file a loaded and parsed when you try to call it?
[04:44:34] <sebsen> yes
[04:44:54] <seutje> sysdef: is that a fact?
[04:45:00] <sebsen> both files are completely loaded
[04:45:21] <seutje> sebsen: and you are sure there's no iife around the stuff in file a?
[04:45:49] <sebsen> only a document.ready()
[04:46:00] <seutje> yeah, that creates a scope
[04:46:20] <seutje> the function() {} you pass into $(document).ready()
[04:46:32] <seutje> your game variable doesn't leak outside that
[04:46:34] <sebsen> yes
[04:46:37] <seutje> unless u specifically tell it to
[04:46:41] <sebsen> ah ok thank u
[04:46:43] <sysdef> seutje: as long you have no user mode Q enabled ;)
[04:46:50] <sebsen> how can i tell it?
[04:46:59] <seutje> by attaching it to the window object (or any other global object you have access to)
[04:47:01] <sammich> you have to return it to the global scope
[04:47:20] <sebsen> can u give me an example in code?
[04:47:33] <seutje> usually it's just the window object, but try to stick to your app's namespace
[04:47:52] <seutje> sebsen: after defining var game = { ... }; just add window.game = game;
[04:48:02] <sebsen> ok thank u
[04:48:08] <seutje> or whatever name you wish to expose it as
[04:48:33] <seutje> it can be usefull to namespace them so you have like window.myApp.options and window.myApp.instances and so forth
[04:48:36] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/FAhsu/
[04:48:49] <seutje> so all ur shit in limited to window.myApp
[04:49:08] <seutje> and by "shit" I mean precious datas, of course
[04:49:22] <sammich> it also means your users can't easily go an mess up your 'datas'
[04:49:40] <sebsen> ok thanks guys
[04:50:12] <seutje> sysdef: ever tried to get actual php help in there?
[04:52:05] <sammich> hmm, is there anyone in jQuery Mobile here on during my working hours? My day starts at 9am (13 hours back from now) for 9 hours
[04:52:19] <amitprakash> What event do I delegate to execute a function if a new row is added to a table T?
[04:52:22] <sammich> because I know arschmit_z is one, but he's never around that time
[04:52:47] <sammich> T.on(event, 'tr', function() {}
[04:52:48] <sammich> )
[04:52:49] <CrysAk> can anyone help? how do i ensure this function doesnt re-trigger before it;s already been completed (on scroll) http://pastebin.com/9L0SSGv6
[04:53:30] <seutje> amitprakash: DOM manipulation don't emmits events in the classic sense
[04:53:38] <sysdef> seutje: no, php isn't my choice because it's a crappy inconsistent language
[04:54:00] <vsync_> yes, asm is my language. very consistent
[04:54:19] <sammich> asm.js? How is the memory usage on it?
[04:54:25] <amitprakash> seutje, so then my smartest bet is change() ?
[04:54:26] <vsync_> no, not js
[04:54:28] <amitprakash> that kinda sucks
[04:54:40] <vsync_> assembler, brother
[04:54:55] <sammich> okay, which instruction set?
[04:55:13] <seutje> so when I compare javascript string literals to how PHP handles them, you shoo me to their channel when you have no idea if it's even of any use?
[04:55:15] <sammich> asm is like 500 levels below JS
[04:55:21] <seutje> I'm putting you on my "cool guy" list!
[04:55:22] <vsync_> yes
[04:55:39] <vsync_> i write my own js clone in asm, though i have to build a lot of other things before that
[04:55:45] <vsync_> i call it
[04:55:48] <vsync_> asmscript
[04:55:50] <sammich> jasm
[04:55:51] <vsync_> very consistent
[04:55:58] <seutje> asthmascript?
[04:56:18] <vsync_> asm as in awesome
[04:56:19] <sammich> not(veryscripty)script
[04:56:23] <seutje> that's how my puny brain processed asmscript
[04:58:02] <sammich> jscc -S script.js
[04:58:07] <sammich> echo script.s
[04:59:16] <vsync_> sammich: the lower levels you go, the chances are it being more consistent
[04:59:29] <vsync_> just due to it being simple
[04:59:37] <vsync_> my advise: go asm
[04:59:40] <vsync_> advice
[05:00:01] <seutje> re-inventing the wheel like it's ajob!
[05:00:08] <vsync_> might take a few years to actually develop anything for web but hey...
[05:00:38] <seutje> 7 year development process for a todo app is perfectly acceptable, right?
[05:00:45] <sammich> well, probably by fault anyway: when I was doing C at uni, I outputted a hello world C file to asm from uni (Fedora) and and at home in OS X
[05:00:50] <vsync_> at least on government jobs, seutje
[05:01:01] <sammich> Fedora gave me, what, 10 lines of code. OS X spat out about 30
[05:01:33] <sammich> at this point, I'm not comfortable with calling asm 'code'
[05:01:47] <vsync_> i like how steve 'cancer' jobs branded os x as a unix
[05:01:59] <sammich> well, has certification
[05:02:09] <sammich> 'built on unix'
[05:02:10] <vsync_> it does, but you only get it with $$
[05:02:20] <vsync_> no, it has a UNIX branding
[05:02:45] <sammich> well, Apple does have the money
[05:02:51] <amitprakash> seutje, mutationobserver seems useful
[05:02:56] <vsync_> did it many years ago, sammich, pr trick
[05:03:09] <seutje> amitprakash: sry, totally forgot about you :x
[05:03:30] <sammich> vsync_: yeah I know, I'm a tad bit of a mac follower
[05:03:53] <seutje> amitprakash: mutation observers is an approach that has since been axed afaik
[05:03:56] <vsync_> alright, speaking of, i'd need a solid built laptop under €500
[05:04:02] <sammich> I remember there used to be a DOM change event :D
[05:04:04] <amitprakash> seutje, oh
[05:04:12] <vsync_> or not solid built per se, but something with a great keyboard, any suggestions?
[05:04:12] <seutje> amitprakash: its standardized alternative is mutation events
[05:04:14] <sammich> that was a fun event
[05:04:24] <seutje> amitprakash: but unfortunately, they aren't very standardized
[05:04:34] <seutje> amitprakash: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Mutation_events
[05:04:35] <vsync_> totally offtopic, sorry
[05:05:09] <sammich> vsync_: what's that equiv in USD purchasing power
[05:05:15] <seutje> amitprakash: wait, now I'm getting confused which got axed and which didn't lol
[05:05:20] <amitprakash> seutje, i think its the other way round.. mutationevents have been deprecated in favor of mutationobservers
[05:05:25] <vsync_> well, say maybe $650
[05:05:29] <seutje> amitprakash: yeah, ur right, my apologies :x
[05:05:40] <sammich> usage?
[05:05:43] <amitprakash> Mutation events cause performance issues and lacking of cross browser support. :)
[05:06:04] <seutje> amitprakash: but you might notice the poor support coverage table at the bottom
[05:06:12] <seutje> `caniuse mutationobservers
[05:06:20] <vsync_> mostly coding. Also I need it to house my music collection so minimum 500 gs of hdd
[05:06:45] <sammich> so you need a decent res screen
[05:06:48] <amitprakash> seutje, in house app .. i think we can make do :)
[05:07:15] <vsync_> sammich: it will be on-the-go coding, so a 13xx will do I think
[05:07:31] <sammich> as an aside, I built a pretty good example of a spaghetti coded ap
[05:07:47] <sammich> regularly spend some amount of time finding where I put a function
[05:07:54] <vsync_> As laptops with 1680 or so screens will be over my budget
[05:08:47] <sammich> http://configure.ap.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=dw51t202au&model_id=inspiron-15-3521&c=au&l=en&s=dhs&cs=audhs1&
[05:08:55] <seutje> amitprakash: just wanted to make sure you don't expect to support a version of IE to be released within this lifetime :P
[05:08:55] * sammich shudders
[05:09:13] <sammich> at the 10/100 ethernet, that is
[05:09:20] <CrysAk> can anyone help? how do i ensure this function doesnt re-trigger before it;s already been completed (on scroll) http://pastebin.com/9L0SSGv6
[05:09:36] <seutje> `g debounce
[05:09:45] <grafi> vsync_ there are no laptops with great keyboards :p
[05:10:06] <sammich> don't tell me you're in the 'mechanical rul3z' camp?
[05:10:14] <sammich> clicky clicky clicky
[05:10:33] <vsync_> i am, unfortunately
[05:10:37] <grafi> clicky clicky is nice but for 12hour shifts mx browns are better :D
[05:10:41] <seutje> CrysAk: you're probably looking to debounce the scroll handler, so it cannot be triggered more than once per x ms
[05:10:46] <arschmitz> sammich: you were looking for some mobile help?
[05:11:04] <sammich> I've got some issues, yeah :|
[05:11:06] <vsync_> grafi: i'm using a model M and a newer one with cherry blacks
[05:11:13] <grafi> woohoo
[05:11:14] <grafi> :P
[05:11:18] <seutje> CrysAk: underscore and lodash and such provide tools to easily debounce functions, but if you're already using jQuery a lot, might as well look at http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[05:11:28] <seutje> also has nice explanation of the theory behind it
[05:11:32] <CrysAk> thansk seutje
[05:11:33] <vsync_> A laptop with a buckling spring system would be awesome
[05:11:35] <vsync_> =D
[05:11:40] <sammich> arschmitz: where to start (gonna type a chunk after this line)
[05:11:40] <vsync_> would weigh 5 kgs though
[05:11:49] <vsync_> thanks sammich anyway ill take a look
[05:15:01] <sammich> arschmitz: can't get the slider to update even on 'change()', it won't update first time I bring up the page with it, but it will work the 2nd time around. 2) I have 3 pages. If I go from 1 -> 2 (DOM order), and back to 1, it flashes through page 3. And finally, there's this issue with my content being drawn under a header, but I suspect that's because I should be writing into that page after pagechange
[05:17:11] <sammich> but to you keyboard snobs out there, I'm happily typing on my Apple chicklet keyboards :)
[05:17:27] <spl1nes> hey, just a quick question. google and yahoo recommend including scripts (functions) as soon as possible (head) but execute the code as late as possible (right above </body>)
[05:17:36] <spl1nes> now i was wondering if the same would apply for .ready
[05:18:10] <spl1nes> I mean let's assume a script only requires .ready and .resize
[05:18:42] <Cork> spl1nes: ready is basically the same as having the script at the end of body
[05:18:44] <spl1nes> from my point of view it seems too much create another script file and include it at the bottom when it only includes these two lines
[05:18:53] <spl1nes> ah ty cork
[05:19:14] <Cork> spl1nes: also if you include scripts have them all at the bottom of the page if you want that
[05:19:38] <Cork> if you have the script in the header you will block the page rendering for the script to be fetched
[05:20:02] <spl1nes> Didn't yahoo and google mention that this is only the case if you execute the code?
[05:20:06] <Cork> so if you're after to minimize the load time you want as much of the scripts as possible at the bottom
[05:20:13] <Cork> spl1nes: no
[05:20:26] <Cork> the browser has to execute the script to parse it
[05:20:42] <vsync_> sammich: blah, it's like typing on a laptop
[05:20:51] <Cork> if you just by executing it creates a set of functions that makes little difference to be browser
[05:20:55] <vsync_> the movement is non-existant
[05:21:08] <vsync_> movement, i mean travel
[05:21:25] <arschmitz> sammich: just give me a minute i making a jsbin to demonstrate
[05:21:27] <Cork> spl1nes: though yes, if you don't execute it you remove the jit cycle of the script at load
[05:21:40] <sammich> arschmitz: thanks
[05:21:48] <Cork> spl1nes: but the network load, and parsing is still done
[05:22:03] <sammich> vsync_: yeah but wouldn't less travel be...more efficient?
[05:22:06] <vsync_> sammich: in addition to being a keyboard snob, i'm also a bit of an "audiophile" =D so yeah, i'm a snob of the worst kind
[05:22:14] <vsync_> sammich: has no feel to it
[05:22:27] <sammich> i'm afraid you and I cannot be in the same room
[05:22:31] <Cork> spl1nes: how much that network load matters depends on how slow the network the client uses is
[05:23:05] <sammich> kidding, I just consume music, I don't care as long as it's not crap
[05:23:27] <dwarder> whats up with the jquery site?
[05:23:29] <vsync_> however, i'm also an electronic engineer so my audiophileness is not the kind where you power your amp through 10 capacitors and so on
[05:23:43] <sammich> vacuum tubes?
[05:23:43] <dwarder> it is offline
[05:23:51] <vsync_> nah.
[05:24:25] <sammich> brace yourself
[05:24:35] <vsync_> my audiophilia is limited to a pair of sennheiser hd25's, beyerdynamic dt990s and 2x fiio amps (cheap chinese)
[05:24:35] <sammich> I have a Bose Companion 3 set here
[05:24:36] <spl1nes> Cork: thanks for clarifying
[05:25:08] <dwarder> looks like jquery websites are down only for me, are there mirrors?
[05:25:13] <vsync_> yeah i hear true audiowankers hate on boses
[05:25:31] <sammich> jquery.com fine here
[05:25:48] <Cork> dwarder: what are you looking for?
[05:25:53] <Cork> the files?
[05:25:53] <vsync_> but, i can't go to head-fi anymore. So many clueless idiots who have all these theories on how to improve sound quality, and they think they actually know something about the electronics involved
[05:26:06] <dwarder> Cork: i need http://docs.jquery.com/
[05:26:12] <netiul> can i call a function of a widget without having an isntance yet? like $.ns.somewidget.function() ?
[05:26:21] <Cork> dwarder: check your dns then
[05:26:24] <vsync_> anyway my offtopic rants are out, i'm heading home! cyas
[05:26:32] <sammich> aww, bai
[05:26:48] <dwarder> Cork: or kill my ISP ?
[05:26:54] <dwarder> Cork: are there mirrors?
[05:27:07] <Cork> dwarder: it's cdn'ed
[05:27:15] <Cork> and no no mirrors as far as i know
[05:27:30] <Cork> dwarder: the url you want is most likely api.jquery.com though
[05:28:39] <dwarder> Cork: not reachable too
[05:28:50] <dwarder> Cork: looks like all jquery web sites
[05:28:51] <Cork> dwarder: what ip do you get?
[05:29:04] <dwarder> Cork: including http://jqueryui.com/
[05:29:25] <arschmitz> sammich: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/870/edit
[05:29:27] <Cork> dwarder: try adding 70.32.120.34 api.jquery.com to your hosts file
[05:29:40] <dwarder> Cork: 70.32.120.34
[05:29:50] <Cork> oook
[05:29:55] <arschmitz> am i accurately representing what your trying to do?
[05:29:59] <Cork> you have a broken rout
[05:30:07] <Cork> dwarder: time to nag your isp
[05:30:38] <Cork> or try using a proxy
[05:31:04] <sammich> arschmitz: thanks, having a look now
[05:31:18] <arschmitz> dwarder: that most likely means that media temple whom we use for hosting has blacklisted your IP for attacking one of their servers at some point
[05:31:33] <sammich> hah
[05:33:39] <vinky> how do I copy input elements with their state?
[05:33:51] <seutje> `jqapi close
[05:33:55] <seutje> doh
[05:33:57] <seutje> I meant clone
[05:33:58] <Cork> close??
[05:34:00] <Cork> :D
[05:34:06] <seutje> shaddap cork :P
[05:34:08] <goddard> this isn't being triggered for some reason on form fields http://jsfiddle.net/bUv7m/
[05:34:08] <Cork> ?.clone
[05:34:09] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[05:34:19] <seutje> screw it, going back to sleep
[05:34:23] <goddard> is there anything i could do to make it more global so it works no matter what when visible.
[05:34:24] <Cork> lol :P
[05:34:35] <vinky> seutje, if that was for it wont work according to the docs
[05:35:03] <Cork> vinky: it's the closest you have
[05:35:13] <Cork> but yes, some state isn't kept
[05:35:56] <Cork> goddard: ever though about using variables for your target elements instead of looking up the id over and over again?
[05:36:31] <goddard> Cork: like how?
[05:36:43] <Cork> var something = $('#expiration_verification');
[05:36:43] <goddard> Cork: if it changes wont i need to look it up again and again?
[05:36:55] <SDr> howdy, anyone knows what plugin this site is using: http://devdocs.io/html-html5/    for the menu dropdown on the left?
[05:37:03] <goddard> Cork: i put a alert(); and it never gets called any way
[05:37:07] <Cork> goddard: only if the element is replaced
[05:37:18] <Cork> goddard: fields2.is(':visible') == false?
[05:37:27] <goddard> Cork: i remove the required piece with prop
[05:37:33] <goddard> its true
[05:37:37] <goddard> at least it should be
[05:37:56] <Cork> why are you statically checking if the elements is visible before you bind the key bindings?
[05:37:57] <soee> if i have several checkboxes with id that match this pattern:  foo_x_bar where X is integer, how can i call some action if state of any of this those checkboxes will change >
[05:38:25] <Cork> soee: give them a common class and bind that
[05:38:32] <chase-work> any suggestions on why the jquery-ui draggable element is delayed, and sluggish when being dragged? I found an article saying to remove position:relative from the parent and *{padding: 0}, but I have neither.
[05:38:41] <Cork> soee: $('.common-class').on('change')
[05:39:12] <chase-work> I tried to profile the page while dragging, and even clicking on the Layout & Rendering tab takes a while
[05:39:18] <soee> Cork, change will work fine for checkboxes (check/unchek) ?
[05:39:31] <Cork> soee: for those you want click normally
[05:42:32] <goddard> Cork: even removing is(':visible') doesn't trigger the event
[05:42:57] <sammich> arschmitz: that example is how I understand jQuery Mobile to work. But I think the timing is all wrong. Like when I should be inserting HTML to a div. Before or after $.mobile.changepage()?
[05:43:21] <Cork> goddard: console.log(fields2.length) is ?
[05:43:41] <arschmitz> sammich: im not sure what you mean do you mean you have dynamic content you want to insert into a page durring navigation?
[05:43:52] <sammich> yeah
[05:44:05] <arschmitz> do you inted jqm to enhance this content?
[05:44:21] <sammich> so pages are basically edit forms, and when I switch back it'll redraw the whole content view
[05:44:36] <sammich> yeah, it is currently
[05:44:46] <sammich> collapsibles with reflow tables inside those
[05:45:15] <arschmitz> ok then you need to do it on pageCreate
[05:45:32] <arschmitz> this is the point just before the content is enhanced
[05:45:39] <sammich> so that's the convention then
[05:45:46] <arschmitz> yes
[05:45:55] <sammich> I couldn't figure out which of those page events it was
[05:46:42] <goddard> Cork: do i type that in using chrome web tools console?
[05:46:44] <sammich> so do pages get a 're-enhance' when they are brought up again?
[05:46:45] <arschmitz> sammich: yeah i have a demo for them because we know they are confusing but its changing in a couple weeks so im waiting until the new version so it will be correct
[05:46:46] <goddard> if so ReferenceError: fields2 is not defined
[05:47:00] <Cork> goddard: no you add it directly after var fields2 = ;
[05:47:09] <Cork> (the following row)
[05:47:14] <arschmitz> sammich: did that address your slider issue as well?
[05:47:59] <sammich> I think it's still a timing issue. I'll work through it slowly since I'm working over VPN atm
[05:48:38] <seutje> my condolances
[05:48:41] <arschmitz> sammich: ok
[05:48:44] <sammich> pagecreate should fix that problem
[05:48:50] <seutje> condolences* lol
[05:49:06] <seutje> condo-lances sound pretty awesome though
[05:49:08] <sammich> seutje: it's 11pm, much better than at work :)
[05:49:41] <seutje> no need for VPN shenanigans when working from home
[05:49:59] <sammich> I do if I want my autocomplete data to load
[05:50:20] <sammich> among other ajax requests
[05:50:45] <seutje> used to work at a company where internal stuff was only accessible over the VPN
[05:50:48] <sammich> besides, it's a VPN inside a VM, so I have my home net on my main OS
[05:51:02] <seutje> so annoying
[05:51:22] <seutje> that's the sorta shit that makes programmers have a high suicide rate
[05:51:31] <sammich> well, it's not like our software is anything but intranet only
[05:52:21] <seutje> even our intranet tools are publicly accessible :D
[05:52:58] <sammich> it'd be nice, I guess. Doesn't really bother me
[05:53:22] <seutje> I can request (additional) vacation from timbuktu over an open free wifi
[05:54:55] <goddard> Cork: it gave me 10
[05:55:31] <vinky> if I .clone() something and then remove it the clone, is both supposed to be removed?
[05:55:31] <Cork> goddard: could you include the html in the fiddle so the code actually runs?
[05:55:41] <Cork> vinky: no
[05:55:55] <Cork> a clone is a completely separate entity
[05:56:14] <vinky> I guessed so, have some debugging to do
[05:56:17] <sammich> best way to clone an object (besides a date)
[05:56:30] <sammich> JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))?
[05:57:02] <seutje> I think he's talking about dom nodes
[05:57:16] <seutje> JSON way would definitely asplode any event handlers
[05:57:33] <sammich> oh yeah, nah I just a JS object
[05:58:03] <ajpiano> sammich: var bar = $.extend({}, foo);
[05:59:26] <sammich> don't think that's better than my way
[05:59:46] <ajpiano> your way destroys any methods on the object
[06:00:59] <goddard> Cork: i would be its so large i think it would be pointless ... and some how you helps because its working
[06:01:01] <seutje> yeah, that would only be beneficial when using super-huge object that don't contain anything more complicated that obj/arr/str/bool/int
[06:01:26] <goddard> Cork: i am now going to sleep after my 20 hour work day
[06:01:28] <sammich> okay. Methods on the object, you mean if there were functions in there?
[06:01:32] <ajpiano> yes
[06:01:40] <sammich> ah, noted
[06:01:50] <seutje> theoretically, it is faster though (on most browsers)
[06:01:59] <sammich> http://jsperf.com/cloning-an-object/2

[06:02:05] <seutje> :)
[06:02:21] <vinky> hm no idea why but I did append() instead of clone()...
[06:02:37] <sammich> wooo, JSON wins
[06:03:02] <sammich> but yeah, I guess if I tried that on something with functions defined, I'd have found that error out
[06:03:16] <Cork> seutje: that's comparing pears and apples...
[06:03:20] <seutje> Cork: I know
[06:03:31] <seutje> sammich: for me, the simple clone wins
[06:03:36] <ajpiano> sammich: you're optimizing very much the wrong thing
[06:03:38] <seutje> this shows how much it matters
[06:03:41] <ajpiano> if this is the type of perf you're optimizing for
[06:03:56] <Cork> seutje: not even sure where the parse/stringify combo would be used
[06:04:04] <seutje> Cork: scroll up :P
[06:04:10] <sammich> I have a dataset that I need to keep a canon copy of, so I just clone it
[06:04:14] <Cork> to clone an object...
[06:04:24] <Cork> seutje: and what about elements in the object?
[06:04:28] <seutje> and destroy half of it :D
[06:04:30] <Cork> or functions?
[06:04:37] <seutje> Cork: yo, this wasn't my suggestion
[06:04:45] <Cork> or proxys, or getters or...
[06:04:48] <seutje> no crucify plix!
[06:04:52] <Cork> -_-
[06:05:01] * sammich watches his question implode
[06:12:04] <netiul> i need to extend the functionality of any instance of a widget on the fly, any ideas on how to do that?
[06:23:11] <Bauer> guys, I am using this plugin: http://jordankasper.com/jquery/imagecheck/examples.php on this page: http://devstore.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=VirtualMachines_Filter_Test to substitute (visually) checkboxes with images. Problem is, that apparently it requires 2 clicks to trigger the checkbox event (and picture changes) - why? how to debug that?
[06:26:43] <dwarder> how do i check if element $('#element') exist ?
[06:26:53] <dwarder> or if it doesn't
[06:26:59] <grafi> .length
[06:27:26] <grafi> Bauer the pictures change on the first click for me
[06:27:46] <Bauer> grafi yes, but then try to deselect it - it requires 2 clicks
[06:27:55] <Bauer> and re-selecting again, also requires 2 clicks
[06:28:00] <dwarder> grafi: if($('#elelment').length){alert('i do exist!!');}   ?
[06:29:15] <grafi> should work, also it might be better to do .length == 0
[06:29:50] <seutje> no need
[06:30:02] <Cork> or even better length < 1 :)
[06:30:23] <Cork> (yes it's the old asm coder in me reacting :)
[06:30:25] <Cork> )
[06:30:33] <grafi> oô
[06:30:39] <grafi> explain Cork
[06:30:44] <seutje> ur old?
[06:30:46] <seutje> :P
[06:31:06] <grafi> or he has eaten an old asm coder ...
[06:31:09] <grafi> you monster!!
[06:31:10] <Cork> grafi: the jump loop, sometimes you could get things to jump past your check
[06:31:18] <Cork> and you ended up with an eternal loop
[06:31:25] <grafi> cool stuff
[06:31:26] <grafi> oô
[06:32:21] <DamienStIT> any advice for a good jquery / less / html editor ?
[06:32:21] <Cork> something = []; something[99] = 'something'; for(var i = 0; i == 100;i++) { if(something[i] == 'something') { i++; } }
[06:32:24] <Cork> *opps* :D
[06:32:38] <defk0n> Any dutch people in here?
[06:33:15] <Cork> ^ that is the c style equiv of the problem i talked about
[06:33:52] <grafi> ^^
[06:34:15] <Cork> so i learned early on to never check ranges with ==
[06:34:23] <DamienStIT> i use eclipse because of java dev , but i often stuck with lack of good color syntaxing and code folding in it
[06:34:28] <Cork> cause if length for some reason is -1 then what?
[06:34:53] <Cork> DamienStIT: give sublime text a whirl
[06:34:57] <seutje> DamienStIT: sublimetext
[06:35:02] <grafi> subl!
[06:35:03] <seutje> DAMNIT CORK
[06:35:03] <Cork> or vi
[06:35:08] <Cork> *vim
[06:35:21] <grafi> pfft
[06:35:32] <seutje> or just use chrome :D
[06:35:35] * seutje hides
[06:35:36] <grafi> vim is just so ugly on windows
[06:35:43] <seutje> windows is ugly on windows
[06:35:49] <Cork> ya
[06:35:50] <grafi> well
[06:35:52] <grafi> yes
[06:35:53] <DamienStIT> vim.i want smth user friendly ..
[06:35:59] <seutje> so it kinda fits in :D
[06:36:09] <DamienStIT> with autocompletion or this kind of powerfull features
[06:36:11] <grafi> sublime looks awesome on windows
[06:36:43] <Cork> DamienStIT: sublime is fast and has quite good supports (a bit byggy though)
[06:36:49] <Cork> and easy to use
[06:36:53] <Cork> not free though
[06:36:59] <grafi> nagware
[06:37:13] <DamienStIT> not free indeed :-)
[06:37:16] <Cork> ya, and like 20 or 30 usd to buy
[06:37:28] <grafi> oO
[06:37:30] <grafi> since when
[06:37:33] <Cork> a bit hefty
[06:37:42] <seutje> well worth it imo
[06:38:04] <seutje> you can probably find a package for any type of additional functionality you had in mind
[06:38:09] <Cork> ah was the upgrade
[06:38:15] <grafi> wasnt it more like 60-70usd?
[06:38:17] <Cork> grafi: ya, its 70 :)
[06:38:20] <grafi> kk
[06:38:22] <seutje> hell, u can have it run a static webserver through a package
[06:38:28] <grafi> still worth it though
[06:38:44] <seutje> better wait for sublime3 lol
[06:38:44] <grafi> its just awesome
[06:38:49] <Bauer> Cork: do you have a few mins to look at http://devstore.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=VirtualMachines_Filter_Test please? my issue is that second time you try to click it, you need two clicks for it to work..
[06:39:23] <grafi> Bauer why not start by reducing your included jqueries to 1
[06:39:24] <grafi> ...
[06:39:58] <grafi> not sure if that causes problems, but it makes me itchy
[06:41:19] <Cork> uh...
[06:41:24] <Cork> 4 versions in one page O_o
[06:41:29] * Cork shivers
[06:42:10] <grafi> yeah
[06:42:14] <Cork> Bauer: you have a syntax error in some parsing script somewhere though
[06:42:17] <grafi> its cruel
[06:42:54] <Bauer> lol, I am not the guy in charge of the store, I only help with the JS stuff for "complex" things for them, like this filter thing...
[06:43:10] <Bauer> but I will remove duplicate jquery.. it could be the cause
[06:43:15] <Bauer> although unlikely
[06:43:58] <grafi> xD
[06:44:27] <noregret> is there a way to extract a number from a string?
[06:44:39] <Cork> ?g mdn parseInt
[06:44:40] <bot-t> Cork, parseInt - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[06:45:10] <Cork> Bauer: btw => TypeError: obj is null | https://www.ccc.co.il/App_Themes/conf/changelang.js | Line 1
[06:45:48] <Bauer> I know Cork, but that part is not my code, not my responsibility
[06:46:28] <Cork> Bauer: but it might be the cause of your problems
[06:46:38] <noregret> Cork: i'm talking about extrating a number from a string of characters
[06:46:59] <Cork> Bauer: javascript running in a page that throws exceptions is risky, cause your code might not run (or even parse) cause of it
[06:47:11] <Cork> noregret: ya?
[06:47:22] <Cork> noregret: could you provide an example of what you want to do?
[06:47:25] <noregret> Cork: like "data[Entity][0][Type]" for example, that returned a NaN
[06:48:08] <grafi> xD
[06:48:22] <grafi> regex ftw
[06:48:36] <Cork> ?eval "data[Entity][0][Type]".match(/[0-9]+/)[0] @ noregret
[06:48:38] <bot-t> noregret: "0"
[06:48:54] <Cork> ?eval parseInt("data[Entity][0][Type]".match(/[0-9]+/)[0], 10) @ noregret
[06:48:55] <grafi> coolio
[06:48:55] <bot-t> noregret: 0
[06:49:11] <grafi> ?eval parseInt("data[Entity][0][Type]".match(/[0-9]+/)[0], 2)
[06:49:12] <bot-t> grafi: 0
[06:49:34] <Cork> ?eval parseInt("data[Entity][10][Type]".match(/[0-9]+/)[0], 2) @ noregret
[06:49:34] <bot-t> noregret: 2
[06:49:37] <Cork> opps :)
[06:49:42] <grafi> xD
[06:50:28] <grafi> pfft
[06:51:30] <noregret> oool, thanks =)
[06:52:34] <Bauer> lol, well touching that fragile code and removing excess JS calls, creates other errors...
[06:53:52] <Cork> Bauer: i honestly would not accept working on a page that broken
[06:54:22] <Cork> they either need to fix it, (or why not pay you to have it fixed :D )
[06:54:40] <Cork> hack and slash pages is horrible to work with
[06:55:54] <Bauer> lol, I understand :) I didnt encounter before situations where error in one JS file affected another.. but in the future I will say I cant do my part until the page is working without errors :)
[06:56:18] <Bauer> actually thats how I will leave this page now... let the poor guy fix it :)
[06:56:30] <Cork> Bauer: well something in the other files might trigger and error, and there by not run your code
[06:56:55] <Bauer> Cork: but in that case, wouldnt I see the error in console, for every single click that is not working?
[06:56:58] <Cork> (that is; the browser won't run your code, the call doesn't have to come from that file)
[06:57:09] <Cork> Bauer: not garanteed
[06:57:16] <Cork> your code might never be parsed at all
[06:57:29] <Cork> so no event handler to error in
[06:58:03] <Cork> i'm talking in generic terms here though, just so you know
[06:58:24] <Cork> i haven't plowed through the page
[06:58:32] <Bauer> yup, next time as I said I wont begin work on an already broken page :)
[06:59:23] <xhoy> i have a list of jquery tabs,
[06:59:58] <xhoy> but when i activeate the $().tabs() thing, it automagicaly reloads to the first tab.. and i don't see why he would do that :)
[07:00:27] <Cork> xhoy: it does that by default
[07:00:35] <Cork> you can set active: in the options
[07:02:03] <grafi> automagically
[07:02:10] <grafi> my new favorite word
[07:02:33] <Cork> well not exactly a new word though :)
[07:02:59] <grafi> new favorite though
[07:03:03] <Cork> heh
[07:03:17] <grafi> although i have no idea what my old favorite word would have been
[07:03:41] <xhoy> Cork: AH
[07:03:52] <xhoy> Cork: thanks

[07:11:52] <grafi> this guy needs a testsuite
[07:15:41] <razieliyo> hi
[07:16:02] <razieliyo> do I have to use jquery-mobile in order to use $('') jquery selector, or can I use the common jquery?
[07:16:16] <razieliyo> I mean, using it on a mobile device, of course
[07:18:23] <seutje> on most mobile devices, might as well use querySelectorAll
[07:18:30] <Bauer> Cork: you were right... LOL when the poor guy removed the erroring scripts, mine started working :)
[07:18:37] <Bauer> thanks.. important tip :)
[07:18:39] <seutje> but yeah, regular jqueries should do
[07:19:12] <razieliyo> seutje: and what is the jquery mobile specific for?
[07:19:49] <seutje> razieliyo: not sure I understand the question, are you asking what the purpose of jqm is?
[07:19:56] <Cork> razieliyo: jqm is basically a mobile replacement for jquery ui
[07:20:07] <veQue> For numbers that end hundredth place, I need to round up if it's .5 or greater, and I need to round down if it's less than .5 . any help ?
[07:20:12] <Cork> razieliyo: if you don't want the ui parts you can just use plain jquery
[07:20:28] <razieliyo> seutje: yes, that was it
[07:20:48] <razieliyo> Cork: fine, I should take a look at that ui part
[07:20:52] <Cork> veebers: end hundredth's place?
[07:21:29] <Cork> veebers: are you looking for a plain rounding function?
[07:21:37] <razieliyo> seutje, Cork: thank you two for the answers!
[07:21:47] <Cork> ?eval Math.round(10.5) @ veQue
[07:21:49] <bot-t> veQue: 11

[07:22:22] <veQue> ohh that's great
[07:29:04] <Sirisian|Work> where's the documentation in jquery for creating a table? I see blog posts about it.
[07:30:07] <Sirisian|Work> oh it's planned for later hmm
[07:31:31] <c4ptnh00k2> morning gents
[07:31:55] <spobat> hi
[07:32:12] <spobat> how can I say attach function F to all $(this).next('div.popover') + all "header" tags ?
[07:32:27] <spobat> hover event *
[07:32:42] <spobat> do I have to name and externalize the function?
[07:32:58] <spobat> or is there a trick somewhere :p
[07:34:01] <c4ptnh00k2> you can use multiple selectors using a comma
[07:35:14] <Eviltwin> ?.add @ spobat
[07:35:15] <bot-t> spobat, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[07:35:33] <spobat> Eviltwin: what I needed! :)
[07:35:59] <spobat> c4ptnh00k2: yep but that's not possible because I already have one as an object ;)
[07:36:29] <c4ptnh00k2> ahh ok Eviltwins answer was better anywho
[07:37:24] <FortuneDayz> Is it possible to use array elements as you define them? Ie, I want an arry that is name: 'x', price:'y', quantity:'z', subtotal: price*quantity
[07:37:31] <FortuneDayz> but they aren't defined at that point
[07:37:36] <FortuneDayz> do I have to do a foreach and push them?
[07:38:01] <Eviltwin> FortuneDayz: You cannot refer to values in a partially constructed array or object
[07:38:05] <Eviltwin> So you'll have to push
[07:38:12] <FortuneDayz> That's too bad. Thanks :3
[07:41:02] <Cork> FortuneDays: also what you describe is an object not an array
[07:42:09] <Cork> FortuneDays: you can do something like var o = { name: 'x', price:'y', quantity:'z' }; o['subtotal'] = o.price*o.quantity; though
[07:43:24] <reloadz> hi! can anyonegive me link to phone number preg match validation code?
[07:43:34] <reloadz> i am bad with pregs....
[07:43:53] <Cork> i could but it most likely wouldn't work very well for you :)
[07:44:05] <Cork> as it differ from country to country
[07:44:49] <reloadz> hmmm! well... I just need to allow + sign and that is all... no - or space, etc... just +5646546546546465465465465
[07:44:56] <reloadz> and limit maybe 25
[07:45:54] <Cork> /\+[0-9]{1,25}/.test(string)
[07:46:12] <sysdef> reloadz: http://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/phone-no-validation.php
[07:46:16] <Cork> ?eval /\+[0-9]{1,25}/.test('+12456')
[07:46:17] <bot-t> Cork: true
[07:47:02] <Cork> reloadz: but ya, you most likely need something much more complex then that
[07:47:28] <reloadz> I will see
[07:49:55] <saml> jQuery('img#foobar')  how do I execute some code when that <img> is fully loaded?
[07:50:14] <dwarder> is there a type casting in js? like (int)$var in php?
[07:50:17] <Cork> sam452: 1. don't use element tags before your id's
[07:50:29] <Cork> ?.load @ sam452
[07:50:30] <bot-t> sam452, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:50:53] <Cork> dwarder: no, you don't have types in js
[07:51:05] <Cork> dwarder: use parseInt if you want to grab a number from a string
[07:51:18] <Cork> or parseFloat of it's a decimal number
[07:51:22] <dwarder> Cork: i see, thnak you
[07:51:44] <Cork> dwarder: don't forget the base value for parseInt
[07:51:50] <Cork> parseInt(string, 10)
[07:51:54] <ph88> if i have a relation like   libraries -> categories -> books -> chapters  should my rest api handle url's like:   www.server.com/libraries/1/categories/1/books/4/chapters/5/edit  ?
[07:52:21] <Cork> ph8: wrong channel?
[07:53:15] <ph88> Cork: i've no idea for which channel this is appropriate ... because it has many overlap
[07:53:40] <Cork> ph88: depends on what language the api is written in
[07:53:51] <Cork> but either way rest isn't part of jquery so...
[07:54:31] <ph88> just thought people would have experience about it because of jquery $.ajax()  but ok
[07:54:48] <Cork> $.ajax has nothing to do with rest
[07:55:40] <Cork> rest is a way to build paths based on the resource, ajax just loads the url given no knowledge about the structure what so ever
[07:56:12] <ph88> i know ... but veeeery frequently they are used together
[07:56:17] <Cork> ph88: and your question is deeply rest related, enough that i don't want to stick my head into it :)
[07:56:32] <Cork> cause it depends on how pedantic you want to be
[07:57:08] <Cork> ph88: well ya, cause if you want to load a server url through jquery you need $.ajax
[07:57:17] <ph88> well pretty pendantic because it's the first time i'm implementing this ... so want to get it right
[07:57:19] <Cork> ph88: doens't mean jquery knows about rest
[07:57:44] <Cork> ph88: so like i said, ask in a channel for the server language you use
[07:57:56] <Cork> that's where it belongs
[07:58:11] <ph88> the guys of the server code would say ... well that's just how the user request the resource ... not like your server language knows about it
[07:58:20] <Cork> or possibly in #rest if there is such a channel
[07:58:33] <ph88> then the http guys would say: well it's just build on top of the http spec ... it's not really a part of http
[07:58:40] <Cork> ph88: it has everything to do with the server and none with jquery
[07:59:05] <ph88> ah Cork  excellent there is in fact such a channel ^^
[08:00:35] <FortuneDayz> Hrm, anyone know how I can modify the ko.observableArray arrays?
[08:00:35] <FortuneDayz> http://pastebin.com/PzxfbSjq
[08:01:06] <Cork> FortuneDays: thats one array
[08:01:16] <Cork> like i said key:value is objects
[08:01:38] <Cork> FortuneDays: also it would depends on what ko.observableArray generates
[08:01:49] <FortuneDayz> It's knockout; I'm not really sure :S
[08:04:04] <reloadz> Cork: sry... but u made ir WRONG :D:D:D:D naa... just asking how? "+" sign must be OTIONAL. Spaces are alowed. AND LAST... why letters are alowed? :D:D:D
[08:04:21] <xec_> FortuneDays: observableArray implements most of the normal array methods, like .push() and .pop() - how are you trying to modify it?
[08:05:02] <reloadz> Spaces are alowed (if user wants to write with them....)
[08:05:06] <reloadz> can u help?
[08:05:08] <FortuneDayz> Right now I'm at $.each(what I don't know, function() {
[08:05:17] <FortuneDayz> then I'll throw a push in there to add the subtotal

[09:26:07] <enapupe>  change is not firing anyhow on inputs..?
[09:26:19] <enapupe> only on blur..
[09:27:19] <ravenzz> you could trigger the change event when the value changes
[09:27:32] <NotreDev> ok, i built this so someone could perhaps explain to me my (mis)use of the one function: http://jsfiddle.net/mvZLY/
[09:28:08] <enapupe> bleen: http://jsfiddle.net/2NMZF/
[09:28:10] <ravenzz> bleen http://jsfiddle.net/CXZCB/
[09:28:13] <ravenzz> oops
[09:29:22] <enapupe> bleen: see? but I don't think js has this kind of event you need
[09:29:42] <ravenzz> NotreDev seems fine to me
[09:29:59] <NotreDev> ravenzz: the first time you click submit you get the alert. the second time it just submits. why is that?
[09:30:34] <NotreDev> i'm trying to prevent a form from being submitted multiple times...
[09:30:35] <ravenzz> ?one @ NotreDev
[09:30:36] <bot-t> NotreDev, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/

[09:31:05] <NotreDev> ravenzz: i think i misunderstood how i was supposed to use it. thanks!
[09:31:12] <ravenzz> if you want it to be executed all the time, just use on()
[09:39:17] <NotreDev> ravenzz: thanks again. this is what i came up with, and it works well! http://jsfiddle.net/jMLQf/
[09:41:03] <ravenzz> you should cache that selection $(this) into a variable
[09:41:20] <ravenzz> var $this = $(this); $this.foo(); $this.bar();
[09:43:07] <NotreDev> ravenzz: thanks! didn't realize it was taxing, but i see it's a best practice

[09:53:09] <zizzl> hey guys I have a parallax effect on a webpage and its great but is there a way to somehow disable it when a user scrolls back up, that way they don't have to go through it again in reverse on the way up
[09:53:20] <zizzl> I would have to imagine someone has done this

[10:19:41] <cusco> hi
[10:19:50] <cusco> I have a js object
[10:20:09] <cusco> and.. $(obj).length() should return the number of propperties
[10:20:11] <cusco> rithgt'
[10:20:13] <cusco> right?
[10:22:34] <enapupe> cusco:  obj.length maybe?
[10:23:10] <enapupe> $() is a jquery selector, so, $("p").length returns all p elements
[10:23:46] <enapupe> also, length is not a regular function

[10:26:29] <Tomashe> hey guys i was wondering why the eq(0) selector isnt working inside setInterval and how to solve it
[10:26:30] <Tomashe> http://pastie.org/private/msiggbizwlu0mopqsb7i3w
[10:26:36] <Tomashe> line 2
[10:26:40] <Tomashe> 3*
[10:28:21] <enapupe> Tomashe: it seems you have one fighting the other
[10:28:34] <shoky> Tomashe: there's no reason why it shouldn't work. as long as you know that the .css call isn't queued after the animation
[10:28:37] <enapupe> animate() versus css left
[10:30:15] <Tomashe> why css left?
[10:30:42] <enapupe> ops, right
[10:31:00] <Tomashe> i tired few things
[10:31:05] <Tomashe> this is my first try ...
[10:31:15] <enapupe> What to you want to do Tomashe ?
[10:31:22] <Tomashe> http://pastie.org/private/sjhu3f2xxhy6szehnvpc8w
[10:31:31] <Tomashe> this will explain what im trying to do
[10:31:36] <Tomashe> btw this isnt working for me aswell
[10:31:53] <Tomashe> im trying to create cycle effect
[10:31:55] <enapupe> explain to us what do you want to do
[10:31:57] <Tomashe> simple as that
[10:32:06] <shoky> remove the ''
[10:32:08] <Tomashe> if u look at the last link i gave u u wil lsee
[10:32:22] <Tomashe> which '' ?
[10:32:31] <shoky> well
[10:32:37] <shoky> i meant the first one
[10:32:45] <shoky> the second one you can remove too ;p
[10:32:57] <enapupe> I don't think this is going to work: var appender = $(".ICLBC").eq(0);				$(".ICLBC").eq(0).remove();				$(".ICLB").append(appender);
[10:33:05] <Tomashe> but third parm is easing
[10:33:07] <Tomashe> i have no easing
[10:33:13] <shoky> but uh.. the animation callback will be called for EACH .ICLBC element
[10:33:44] <Tomashe> hmm
[10:34:01] <Tomashe> it means the complete will run one time on the first and second time on the second
[10:34:13] <Tomashe> so both will be effected with my code
[10:34:18] <shoky> you might want:  $(".ICLBC").animate({'right':'-=471px'},1000).promise().done(function() { .... })
[10:35:17] <Tomashe> promise?
[10:35:34] <Tomashe> yeah its working
[10:35:41] <Tomashe> weird never heard about promise
[10:37:11] <Tomashe> anyway thats working thanks mate!

[10:40:10] <phrearch> i would like to remove all spanX classes where x is a number. is there an easy way to do this?
[10:40:48] <zizzl> hey guys I have a parallax effect on a webpage and its great but is there a way to somehow disable it when a user scrolls back up, that way they don't have to go through it again in reverse on the way up
[10:41:53] <enapupe> phrearch: maybe a for loop building a string to later call inside a selector?
[10:43:10] <chovy> does anyone know a good viewport plugin which will tell me if an element is scrolled into a viewport?
[10:45:25] <phrearch> enapupe: yea thats probably the way to go
[10:45:34] <enapupe> phrearch: phrearch: var selector = []; var spans = [1,6,8,23,565,88]; for(i=0;i<spans.length;i++){ selector.push(".span"+spans[i]); }
[10:45:41] <enapupe> phrearch: something like this...
[10:46:13] <phrearch> enapupe: thanks, looks good
[10:47:44] <enapupe> phrearch: a better one: 'span' + [1,56,7,8,4,4].join(', .span')
[10:48:09] <enapupe> actually: '.span' + [1,56,7,8,4,4].join(', .span')

In a standard implementation, jQM modifies the hash when the column-toggle dialog opens. It doesn't appear that there is a fallback for when the config for hashListeningE

[10:48:39] <phrearch> enapupe: the first one is fine i think

[10:53:13] <phrearch> enapupe: works for now :-) http://paste.kde.org/786578/
[10:53:21] <vernonk> @tomivs looks like your else is missing a closing curly
[10:53:21] <enapupe> tomivs: is there any? which is?
[10:53:41] <vernonk> Scratch that… bad formatting.
[10:54:05] <enapupe> phrearch: good.. could be better, less selectors
[10:54:10] <enapupe> phrearch: but it works :)
[10:54:21] <vernonk> if ( opcion === "si" )
[10:54:46] <vernonk> Unless si & no are actual variable names.  If you're checking value, you need to enclose those in quotes.
[10:54:50] <enapupe> Tomashe: You opened a { for the else and the if inside the else, closed only 1
[10:55:02] <phrearch> enapupe: yea, ill do some optimization as soon the first prototype is working
[10:56:00] <vernonk> and the "else" should become an "else if" and you can get rid of the nested if

[11:06:10] <enapupe> paulvd: first: ul#list li << this is bad
[11:06:19] <enapupe> it works but also stinks
[11:06:46] <paulvd> then what doesnt stink
[11:06:50] <paulvd> #list li ?
[11:06:51] <paulvd> or #list > li
[11:06:59] <enapupe> just #list li
[11:07:02] <vernonk> @timivs this changes your code a bit, but should work.  Takes care of the couple issues that were there.  http://jsfiddle.net/GuggG/
[11:07:10] <vernonk> Sorry that was for @tomivs
[11:07:16] <enapupe> paulvd: but that is not the issue, right? let me se
[11:07:17] <enapupe> see*
[11:07:35] <paulvd> yeah that isnt..
[11:07:45] <paulvd> all the li's have equal height, except the last one..
[11:07:57] <paulvd> il's of each row
[11:08:13] <tomivs> vernonk, Dafuq var $var ?
[11:08:23] <tomivs> vernonk, this not PHP
[11:08:33] <vernonk> $ is a valid variable name is JS.
[11:08:39] <vernonk> That's what $ is for jQuery
[11:08:58] <vernonk> A common pattern followed is to name variable names that are jQuery collections with a $ to show what they are.
[11:09:10] <vernonk> e.g. var $el = $( this )
[11:09:37] <tomivs> vernonk, Okay
[11:09:43] <vernonk> Now I can reference $el like a normal jQuery object (could do with any other variable name too) like:  $el.find( ".selector" ).addClass( "highlight" )
[11:10:14] <vernonk> That way you're caching your selector and you don't traverse the DOM each time you look for it and want to perform some operation on it.
[11:10:40] <Sirisian|Work> In jquery ui how would I hide an accordion header? http://jsfiddle.net/zpK6k/6/ I need it to still resize to 100% height when one is hidden, but it doesn't look like that's an option. Maybe I just have to remove the item and then insert it again? Is there a simpler way?

[11:16:23] <tomivs> vernonk, http://jsfiddle.net/GuggG/3/
[11:18:36] <vernonk> @tomivs didn't realize this was jQM and a toggle.  Listen to the change event: http://jsfiddle.net/GuggG/4/  (your fiddle update had two versions of jQM loading)
[11:19:06] <PhaseCode> Hey Guys, http://jsfiddle.net/Dafp3/ I only want to be able to do the .sortable when the Test Checkbox is checked can I get some help?
[11:19:07] <paulvd> i figured it out :D
[11:20:10] <vernonk> @tomivs You can also get into the start/stop events that the slider widget gives you out of the box if you would rather use those. http://api.jquerymobile.com/slider/

[12:12:16] <shoky> PhaseCode: jquery has .parent()  and .html() and .closest()

[12:35:10] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[12:35:32] <Toerkeium> before doing 500 validations, I would like to ask if there is a way in jquery to make all undefined variables and objects being something, like "" or something to avoid the validation checking
[12:40:48] <Pitr_> I was about to ask a newbie question, but I'll first finish the challenge :-)
[12:43:56] <sadmicrowave> wow, it's been like 2 years since I've been in here
[12:46:02] <Sirisian|Work> hmm, still can't get this to work. It seems like when I hide an element I can't set the height to 0 no matter what I do. Jquery keeps calculating the height of the object as non-zero and it's messing up my layout.
[12:48:27] <shoky> pmz: never used pjax, sry
[12:48:42] <pmz> np

[13:33:18] <danheberden> Xal_: is the thing[s] you're running `wrapAll` on actually exist? e.g., if someJQueryCollection.wrapAll(), does someJQueryCollection.length > 0 ?
[13:33:36] <Xal_> I just figured it out
[13:33:48] <Xal_> It does exist, and there's more than one of them.
[13:34:12] <Xal_> It works fine if I do .each and run them one at a time.

I'v tried var json = $.getJSON('URL'); alert(json['city']); isn't working. What would be the way to access the json data?
[14:39:14] <Importance> json->city
[14:40:13] <Toerkeium> Importance: I get syntax error if I try that way
[14:40:18] <Importance> i kno haha
[14:40:28] <Importance> first console.log json
[14:40:39] <Importance> then if the city is in there
[14:40:43] <Toerkeium> I did console.log(json->city);
[14:40:50] <Importance> access via json.city
[14:41:01] <Importance> no console.log(json)
[14:41:06] <Importance> the whole set
[14:41:42] <Toerkeium> Ah yes, I did that
[14:42:05] <Toerkeium> and the response includes city, and many more, but I don't know how to access it
[14:42:17] <Toerkeium> don't know how to show the console.log result
[14:42:43] <Importance> var json = not gona work
[14:43:14] <Importance> paste the response
[14:44:03] <Importance> and u have to collect the json response in the success callback
[14:44:27] <Toerkeium> Object { readyState=4, responseText="[{"city":"Buenos Aires"...e":"54","status":"OK"}]", responseJSON=[1], ms...}
[14:44:34] <Toerkeium> that's what it shows in the console

[14:46:16] <Importance> $.getJSON( "test.js", function( json ) {
[14:46:16] <Importance> console.log( "JSON Data: " + json.users[3].name );
[14:46:17] <Importance> });
[14:46:38] <Importance> second arg is ur complete callback
[14:46:47] <Importance> its not going to work outside
[14:48:39] <Importance> oh wait
[14:48:41] <Importance> it can
[14:48:46] <Importance> alternate syntax
[14:48:51] <Importance> jqxhr.complete(function() { console.log( "second complete" ); });
[14:49:01] <Importance> so json.complete
[14:49:24] <Importance> but its still the complete function for that return var
[14:50:47] <Toerkeium> ok, thanks, I'll see what I can do
[14:50:50] <Importance> lol
[14:51:14] <Importance> cant u understand that its not an instant thing
[14:51:23] <Importance> like it has to go to the url
[14:51:39] <Importance> then finish geting stuff from that url
[14:51:47] <Toerkeium> yes I did understand
[14:51:56] <Toerkeium> what's so funny?
[14:52:00] <Importance> ya thats y its a callback
[14:52:43] <Importance> its not the same as this = that
[14:52:59] <grafi> oô
[14:53:04] <grafi> whats going on here
[14:53:10] <Toerkeium> there must be a way to put that object inside a variable and work it out outside the callback function
[14:53:26] <Importance> yes once its finished
[14:53:52] <Toerkeium> why would I wanted to get it before it finished?
[14:53:59] <Toerkeium> do I look so hurry to you?
[14:54:06] <Importance> ya
[14:54:10] <Importance> u look hury
[14:54:15] <Toerkeium> :)
[14:54:40] <Importance> u can settimeout recursice
[14:54:46] <Importance> and wait for it
[14:54:49] <Importance> lool
[14:54:49] <grafi> oO
[14:54:53] <grafi> thats just bad
[14:54:59] <Importance> bad is good
[14:55:18] <Importance> how do u think viruses r made
[14:56:01] <Importance> Toerkeium: if u make it outside ull confuz the shit out of other ppl
[14:56:59] <Toerkeium> Importance: don't give it importance, I'll find some way to make what I need. Thanks anyway
[14:57:19] <Importance> i think ur jus not used to working w callbacks
[14:57:23] <grafi> sp Toerkeium what do you need?
[14:59:03] <Sirisian|Work> Is there a way to get "foo" out of: "<h3>foo<p></p></h3>" basically to get the inner html without any other tags?
[14:59:32] <grafi> have you tried .text() ?
[15:00:19] <Sirisian|Work> grafi, that worked. thanks
[15:00:24] <grafi> np
[15:04:13] <NickNack> I need some suggestions because my mind is at a blank right now
[15:04:38] <Importance> orly
[15:05:56] <Toerkeium> grafi, I'm trying to get the getJSON object into a variable so I can work it out outside the callback function
[15:06:32] <NickNack> im trying to do a window/tab on with on click, now I tried onclick window.open() the window gets blocked, I tried to append a invisible button with a click() function to execute after its created and no go... so any other suggestions?
[15:07:04] <Importance> NickNack: perhaps its ur horible speling
[15:07:19] <NickNack> says the man who cant spell spelling =)
[15:07:28] <Importance> u can try defocus
[15:07:43] <NickNack> funny...
[15:07:44] <Importance> windows.defocus
[15:07:48] <Importance> :\
[15:11:22] <Importance> Toerkeium: i told u its not gona work like that
[15:11:29] <Importance> thx bai
[15:11:52] <smsfail> is there an event for when an element is drawn in the dom?
[15:12:17] <Importance> i dont think so
[15:13:08] <grafi> Toerkeium the question is indeed why, you can make async ajax requests, but thats not really the way its intended
[15:13:12] <smsfail> Importance: I am using knockout if statement in the template and want to "fade" in the elements.. figured jquery would be better and doable.
[15:14:04] <Importance> so fade it
[15:14:16] <Importance> after u append
[15:14:23] <Importance> or watever
[15:14:32] <Importance> but hide it first
[15:14:37] <Importance> so hide
[15:14:44] <Importance> fill
[15:14:48] <Importance> then fadein
[15:15:41] <grafi> NickNack you want to open a new window/tab?
[15:15:48] <NickNack> yeah
[15:16:08] <grafi> and window.open doesnt work?
[15:17:01] <NickNack> grafi: nope popup blocker stops it
[15:17:14] <Importance> so disable it lol
[15:17:25] <Importance> allow popup from THIS site
[15:17:32] <NickNack> -_-
[15:17:39] <grafi> hm
[15:17:42] <grafi> well
[15:18:22] <grafi> a simple target="_blank" link isnt enough?
[15:18:30] <NickNack> I think i know a way that could work but im thinking if there is one more alt
[15:18:37] <tw2113> we must do everything in js though!
[15:18:52] <NickNack> grafi: yeah im thinking about adding that through jquery
[15:19:01] <grafi> thats my problem when I try to do php tw2113
[15:19:06] <grafi> i always start with var
[15:19:07] <grafi> :D
[15:19:07] <Importance> umm no
[15:19:47] <Toerkeium> grafi: thank you, I'll read about async ajax requests!
[15:20:11] <grafi> just dont tell anyone i told you about that oô
[15:20:24] <Toerkeium> lol, ok!
[15:20:42] <Importance> lol its the same thing
[15:20:57] <Importance> async is a flag of .ajax
[15:25:39] <Toerkeium> Importance: with that arrogance, some day you'll need a mport/gno change on your nickname
[15:28:20] <Importance> huh
[15:29:27] <jeebster> how can I have some code on an anchor fire before the browser changes location to the href? event.preventDefault() doesn't seem to be working
[15:30:08] <grafi> still Importance http://jsfiddle.net/EPREd/ this "works" << Toerkeium
[15:30:43] <Importance> right
[15:30:48] <grafi> Toerkeium also look into deferreds they are nicer than the callback hell :)
[15:30:56] <Importance> coz its synced
[15:31:09] <Importance> aaaaaaand test2 is a global var
[15:31:26] <grafi> ...
[15:31:33] <Importance> callbacks r not hell
[15:31:51] <grafi> well i you try to stack ajax calls they can be
[15:32:06] <grafi> you end up with a callback within a callback within a callback
[15:32:13] <grafi> its a tangled mess
[15:32:21] <Importance> they have something new for that
[15:32:24] <grafi> $.when ftw
[15:32:28] <Toerkeium> grafi: that's my actual "problem"
[15:32:39] <grafi> the callback hell?
[15:32:49] <Importance> yea
[15:33:03] <grafi> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[15:33:24] <grafi> deferreds are hella awesome
[15:33:37] <Toerkeium> I'll read about that
[15:33:56] <grafi> and forget about sync ajax calls :P
[15:34:07] <grafi> those are bad for your health
[15:35:31] <Importance> i still think Toerkeium just need to code his shit right
[15:35:44] <Importance> all this other stuff is unrelated
[15:36:59] <Toerkeium> that's another issue, which is probably never going to happen
[15:37:37] <grafi> :P

[15:37:51] <grafi> you live and you learn
[15:37:58] <DarkGhost`> like it would automatically go through and click continue three times for you?

[16:13:55] <burg> hello. it seems that jquery ui datepicker return the timestamp for one day before the date selected. is this how they intended to make it?
[16:15:26] <Importance> ya

[16:25:57] <Importance> -.-
[16:26:24] <burg> shoky, nevermind, what i did not know is that the datepicker returns timestamp in microseconds and not in seconds.
[16:27:14] <shoky> it returns a Date object

[18:07:42] <xecycle> axsuul: I use $('#select').change(cb) --- and it works.
[18:07:55] <axsuul> xecycle: I need to use .on()
[18:08:03] <axsuul> and use event delegation
[18:10:41] <shoky> axsuul: $(document).on('change', '#select',  ... should work

[19:26:47] <azbyin> hi all..
[19:27:54] <azbyin> i'm trying to select elements with an xmldocument generated from the response of an ajax call. Some of the elements are namespaced. All selectors work in chrome, but fail on firefox
[19:28:01] <azbyin> both nightly and stable
[19:33:52] <defaultro> which even should i use if I want to watch the changing of value on an input box? I tried change but it only works when I click outside the input box
[19:34:27] <defaultro> also, the value is being changed when I click on the arrow up and down icon
[19:58:38] <aspect> if I bind multiple handlers to a <button>'s click event using different selectors, can I rely on them firing in binding order?

[20:41:10] <PhaseCode> Hey guys! http://jsfiddle.net/MguRP/4/ I'm trying on click on the edit button to pull up the cells to have text field, however, using the entityTableString with two selectors breaks the code so if var entityTableString = '[id*="entity_table"]' then it will edit the first but if var entityTableString = '[id*="entity_table"],[id*="other_table"]'; it just does the buttom table and messes up the
[20:41:10] <PhaseCode> first one.
[20:45:38] <PhaseCode> Anyone?
[20:46:27] <RobW> i haven't looked at anything but..
[20:46:31] <RobW> id's are and must be unique
[20:46:46] <RobW> your selector looks like i*="blah".. which is wrong, and should be explicit. such as [id="foo"]
[20:55:57] <RobW> PhaseCode: http://jsfiddle.net/MguRP/5/
[20:56:13] <RobW> each of your selectors even needed the sub selectors.. when you used the comma, it indicated a new selector

[21:06:57] <defaultro> hey folks, what does 10 do here? parseInt(this.value, 10)
[21:07:40] <tw2113> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[21:48:04] <culh> Can I modify the interval value, with setInterval(), during code execution and without screwing with the stack?
[22:02:06] <b1lly> culh: I dont know if I understand the question
[22:02:16] <b1lly> but yeah?
[22:04:30] <tw2113> store the interval time as a variable and update as you go?
[22:04:31] <aro> has anyone used uploadify? I am having a weird issue that when I call $.uploadify() on an element, i get a 404 error in the background of my page
[22:04:38] <tw2113> just a guess
[22:04:47] <culh> tw2113: yep
[22:04:48] <culh> doable?
[22:05:01] <tw2113> try it and see
[22:05:34] <culh> I need to check for new messages every so seconds. If the element is active, the interval will me smaller than that of a inactive element/msg window
[22:05:48] <culh> capiche?
[22:06:37] <defaultro> hey folks, what would the reason why event would get the previous value of an input box rather than the one I currently see in the input box?
[22:07:02] <culh> I want to make 1 function to check for all new messages for all users related to the logged on user, then a second function to get the messages, when available
[22:07:11] <defaultro> if i execute $('.numeric').val() in the console, it grabs the correct value
[22:16:00] <culh> tw2113: isn't the interval set on the first run and then only the code inside the set function will be ran?
[22:16:15] <culh> lemme check
[22:18:22] <b1lly> huh?
[22:18:33] <b1lly> you can certainly declare a var outside the scope of the interval callback
[22:18:44] <b1lly> and manipulate it via the callback?
[22:19:29] <b1lly> var foo = 0;   setInterval(function() { foo ++; }, 3000); or whatever the syntax is for setInterval
[22:19:54] <tw2113> my idea was to use a variable in place of the 3000
[22:21:21] <b1lly> idk what he's trying to accomplish
[22:21:28] <culh> this is somethig like what I mean to do... ==> http://jsfiddle.net/BCuTq/
[22:21:59] <culh> To change the 'intervalTime' after setInterval() is set
[22:22:18] <b1lly> sure, what's wrong with that?
[22:22:29] <culh> Not sure it won't mess with the stack?
[22:22:52] <b1lly> you should use setTimeout
[22:23:10] <culh> I need it to keep running every so seconds
[22:23:14] <b1lly> javascript wont "wait" for previously qued intervals
[22:23:30] <culh> That's something I need to do more reading up on
[22:23:44] <b1lly> google setinterval vs settimeout loops
[22:24:02] <culh> Done that. Got to this page: http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery
[22:24:02] <b1lly> but regardless, javascript won't be able to maintain the stack without more work
[22:24:23] <culh> among others
[22:24:37] <b1lly> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/729921/settimeout-or-setinterval
[22:24:48] <culh> read that too
[22:25:25] <b1lly> so what are your thoughts
[22:25:49] <culh> Got pretty ugly in my head when I tryed to build code which unites both
[22:26:00] <b1lly> lol
[22:26:07] <b1lly> anyway
[22:26:20] <b1lly> if your trying to keep the "order" of requests, while changing the interval time
[22:26:30] <b1lly> it won't maintain the "order"
[22:26:48] <culh> Just need a solid way to check for bd updates recursively
[22:26:56] <b1lly> bd updates?
[22:27:06] <culh> e.g. new messages
[22:27:15] <b1lly> why do you need to change the interval?
[22:28:20] <culh> I'd like to maintain several chats going simultaneously and would like to check for updates on the active chat with a smaller interval than the inactive ones
[22:28:46] <culh> So the browser would suffer less?
[22:28:53] <culh> and server*
[22:28:59] <b1lly> i'd argue to return all the chats in one request
[22:29:02] <b1lly> vs multiple requests
[22:29:29] <culh> I made the tables in such a way to allow for that
[22:29:49] <culh> But with flags to finger which user send new messages
[22:29:55] <culh> sent*
[22:30:23] <culh> so the first check would check for new messages, from all users to the one in point, and the second function would get the messages
[22:30:24] <b1lly> so why do you need multiple requests going simutaneously
[22:30:34] <culh> Not quite sure
[22:31:31] <culh> I though about making the second function (that gets the messages and uses more data) with time interval variable
[22:31:45] <culh> s/uses/transfers
[22:31:59] <b1lly> so you have one request to check for new messages?
[22:32:03] <b1lly> and one request to get new messages?
[22:32:16] <culh> Not yet, still working on the semantics
[22:32:19] <b1lly> why can't they be the same request?
[22:32:27] <culh> To reduce traffic
[22:32:41] <b1lly> reduce traffic?
[22:32:42] <culh> I hope
[22:32:52] <b1lly> less requests = better
[22:33:26] <culh> 1 small request, and if needed, a second 'big' request < 1 'big' request?
[22:33:33] <defaultro> when printing e object, the value is shown correctly. However, when I refer to the path like e.currentTarget.value, it displays the old value. Why?
[22:33:44] <b1lly> why is it big
[22:34:03] <b1lly> defaultro: show a test case @ jsfiddle.net
[22:34:14] <defaultro> I will try
[22:34:17] <culh> the first request will print a json list of IDs, of the users that sent messages. The second request will print the messages
[22:34:30] <b1lly> just do it all in one request
[22:34:45] <culh> it would be easyer
[22:35:21] <b1lly> i don't see how fetching twice is any better then fetching once
[22:35:29] <culh> how about the time interval? I'd like it to be as real-time as possible, without crappying out the stack with slow/crappy browsers (IE)
[22:35:41] <b1lly> setTimeout loop
[22:36:01] <culh> sure, but if I set it to 1000ms, it'll get stuch
[22:36:04] <culh> stuck*
[22:36:09] <b1lly> stuck?
[22:36:20] <b1lly> no, you set callback
[22:36:21] <b1lly> for this purpose
[22:36:55] <systemfault> setTimeout is clearly the way to go with that (Write an async loop)
[22:37:06] <culh> I'm trying to anticipate most errors
[22:37:35] <b1lly> I think you should think about the setTimeout implementation, and how it would benefit you
[22:37:45] <b1lly> and try to understand it, and what it's doing
[22:37:49] <b1lly> and then anticipate the errors
[22:38:01] <culh> There's a good example on this on techoctave.com
[22:38:22] <b1lly> I don't need an example ^_^
[22:38:26] <culh> My main concern right now is to improve user experience
[22:38:36] <culh> I do c:
[22:39:21] <culh> But thanks for the attention, I'll be testing it with myself+myself (2nd browser)
[22:39:33] <b1lly> k
[22:39:36] <b1lly> np
[22:40:19] <b1lly> if you're capable, consider web-sockets
[22:40:28] <b1lly> and maybe nodejs ;D
[22:42:35] <defaultro> b1lly: maybe the spinner plugin is hosing up the values
[22:43:03] <b1lly> defaultro: hmm
[22:43:10] <b1lly> idk, i need to see what your doing to debug
[22:43:17] <defaultro> b1lly: if I type the number manually, e.currentTarget.value is correct
[22:43:37] <defaultro> however, if I use the arrow up and down, the value is incorrect and shows the previous number
[22:43:52] <b1lly> defaultro: I'm not certain what your doing
[22:43:56] <culh> web-sockets/nodejs creates a continuous http connection and allows for server-side induced flags, right?
[22:43:57] <b1lly> do you have a test case
[22:44:31] <defaultro> i will try to make one
[22:44:41] <culh> As in the browser doesn't need to keep checking since the flag or whatever will come direcly
[22:44:50] <b1lly> sure
[22:45:08] <b1lly> you create a connection to the server, and then you can broadcast from the server
[22:45:20] <b1lly> or emit/broadcast from the client
[22:45:23] <b1lly> it's all event driven
[22:45:23] <culh> sounds excelent
[22:45:36] <culh> How about performance?
[22:45:51] <b1lly> I don't know how large of an app your trying to build
[22:45:53] <defaultro> i'll try to put this in jsfiddle and update to match what I have, http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/spinner/default.html
[22:46:06] <b1lly> but i've read that node handles ~3000 concurrent connections pretty well
[22:46:39] <b1lly> defaultro: whats broken about this demo
[22:46:47] <culh> I'm building for crappy internet connections. The app is like a small cms, but for a large number of users
[22:46:51] <defaultro> nothing is broken on that demo
[22:47:04] <defaultro> but that is similar to what we have
[22:47:29] <culh> 3k client or server-side?
[22:47:40] <b1lly> ...
[22:47:42] <b1lly> that would be server
[22:47:57] <culh> Can it be increased on demmand?
[22:48:17] <b1lly> #node.js
[22:48:23] <culh> ok
[22:48:46] <culh> I suppose Apache would fill up first anyhow
[23:30:29] <Lann> hey… i'm so stumped. Why would a event handler for keyup give $('#myfield').val() true value in chrome, and null on mobile ?
[23:30:42] <Lann> by mobile i mean ios
[23:31:16] <Cork> Lann: mobile has quite a set if problems
[23:31:21] <Cork> especially with events
[23:31:32] <Cork> though can't say i've had any with keyup yet
[23:31:33] * Lann starts swearing
[23:31:48] <Lann> no matter what event handler i use it still is null on mobile
[23:31:55] <Lann> and still not null in chrome
[23:32:10] <Cork> well mobile uses there element overlay thingy
[23:32:21] <Cork> so the actual element isn't really edited
[23:32:30] <Cork> that might be the cause
[23:32:56] <Cork> Lann: is $('myfield').length > 0 ?
[23:33:23] <Lann> no
[23:33:26] <Lann> i tried that also
[23:33:35] <Cork> no so it is zero?
[23:33:41] <Lann> correct
[23:33:44] <Lann> zero on mobile
[23:33:50] <Lann> true length on anything else
[23:33:51] <Cork> so it doesn't find the element
[23:33:58] <Lann> heh wtf
[23:34:01] <Lann> why
[23:34:19] <Cork> not sure
[23:34:23] <Lann> fml
[23:34:31] <Cork> Lann: have you tried $(this).val() instead?
[23:34:45] <Lann> that would involve lots of passing around
[23:34:47] <Lann> i could set it up
[23:34:57] <Lann> but this is obnoxious
[23:34:57] <Cork> not really
[23:35:09] <Cork> you could set this for functions you call with call(this)
[23:35:27] <Lann> since when is it ok to not find elements on the page?
[23:35:32] <Cork> also check it directly in the event handler
[23:35:46] <Cork> Lann: it doesn't find it cause it's not there
[23:35:54] <Lann> css disagrees
[23:36:04] <Cork> why its not there is the question though
[23:36:23] <Cork> Lann: well like i said, mobile does a lot of hacking with the dom structure
[23:36:40] <Lann> hmm
[23:36:53] <Cork> this is not much jquery can do anything about
[23:37:02] <Cork> cause it just asks the browser for the element
[23:37:28] <Cork> $('#myfield').val() => document.getElementById('myfield').value
[23:38:05] <Lann> and the browser decides it magically is not there now. just for fun?
[23:38:32] <Cork> more or less yes
[23:38:42] <Lann> but only for JS, not css or anything. that'd be broken
[23:39:02] <Lann> </sarcasm>
[23:39:19] <Cork> Lann: like i've said several times now; mobile does dom hacking to get input working with there dual viewport solutions
[23:39:40] <Cork> and yes, if it is the cause it is a bug in the browser
[23:39:46] <Cork> and yes it means you have to deal with it...
[23:40:42] * Lann stares down his phone
[23:43:18] <silv3r_m00n> if the selector contains special characters such as [ or ] then they must be escaped by double slash, as mentioned here, http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/   then why doesnt jquery does it itself ?
[23:43:42] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: depends
[23:43:50] <Cork> is it an attribute selector?
[23:44:17] <Cork> (you should not use [] in id's or classes)
[23:46:01] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: i am using name="form[date]"  in input tags, is it againsts the standards ?
[23:46:07] <Cork> no
[23:46:31] <Cork> $('form[name="form[date]"]')
[23:46:42] <Cork> that is why i asked if it was an attribute
[23:47:03] <silv3r_m00n> i am unable to write this regex, "form[name]".replace(/[\[\]]/g , '$0');
[23:47:11] <silv3r_m00n> need to escape [ and ] with double slasehs
[23:47:12] <Cork> no need for a regex
[23:47:14] <systemfault> Eww, does that actually work with jQuery of you need to somehow escape the inner [] ?
[23:47:15] <silv3r_m00n> slashes*
[23:47:24] <Cork> just do $('form[name="form[date]"]')
[23:47:38] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: that thing is in a variable, not a hard coded string
[23:48:00] <Cork> so $('form[name="'+ 'form[date]' + '"]') then...
[23:48:41] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: the important part is to quote the value for the attribute
[23:49:08] <silv3r_m00n> its like table_id = 'form[name]';  i have table_id to operate on inside a function
[23:49:17] <Cork> fine
[23:49:36] <Cork> (me hopes silv3r_m00n still can add 2 and 2 together)
[23:49:56] <silv3r_m00n> hmm
[23:50:32] <systemfault> Hmm, it's a bit evil to select by name imho...
[23:50:41] <Cork> yes
[23:50:48] <systemfault> Because I see them as being 'backed binding'
[23:50:50] <systemfault> s
[23:50:55] <Cork> was about to say you hsould have an id on the form anyway
[23:50:56] <systemfault> *backend :/
[23:51:12] <Cork> actually normally you don't need a name on it to start with
[23:51:24] <silv3r_m00n> "form[name]".replace(/[\[\]]/g , '\\\\$&');  works well
[23:51:29] <Cork> .....
[23:51:44] <Cork> YOU DON'T NEEED TO ESCAPE IT... TT_TT
[23:52:01] <Cork> for the like 4'th time...
[23:52:15] <fabioportieri> morning
[23:58:03] <silv3r_m00n> Cork: if i dont escape it, $() is not selecting it, what then ?
[23:58:14] <Cork> read what i've said to you 3 times
