[00:00:19] <Cork> crocket: then you know more then me, mdn and api.jquery.com
[00:00:34] <z3l> Hello. I am unable to execute the simple example, I am not looking for a direct information, a link to the apropriate manual page would be sufficient. http://pastebin.com/NLbgZbSK
[00:01:00] <Cork> z3l: a link to what?
[00:01:03] <VectorX> http://bit.ly/JuA4Z7 when your click below "Shopping Cart" on the header middle, it drops down and when you move the move out closes, and click again drops down, anyone see why it would not be working here http://bit.ly/1craLhO
[00:01:19] <z3l> Cork: http://pastebin.com/NLbgZbSK  , this is the example. No alert is visible.
[00:01:26] <crocket> Where can I find the documentation of $$() ?
[00:01:36] <z3l> I have probably wrongly selected the item, but I can not see it.
[00:01:52] <Cork> z3l: on doens't exist in 1.8
[00:02:01] <Cork> use bind
[00:02:55] <z3l> Cork: I see, Let me think for a moment, because I have other methods using on there , which work. I must have wrongly read the jquery version. I haven't written the code, however I must work on it.
[00:03:14] <Cork> z3l: .on was added in 1.9
[00:03:23] <TheJHNZ> does jfid have ui ?
[00:03:25] <Cork> z3l: also make sure you don't use multiple versions of jquery
[00:03:32] <Cork> TheJHNZ: for some jquery versions
[00:03:49] <TheJHNZ> ahh
[00:03:50] <TheJHNZ> god it
[00:03:51] <z3l> Cork: Yeah, it's 1.8.3.
[00:04:03] <Cork> z3l: then that's why
[00:04:12] <Cork> you can't use .on
[00:04:28] <TheJHNZ> got it*
[00:04:30] <Cork> uh...
[00:04:39] <Cork> TheJHNZ: sorry, i mixed up the versions
[00:04:48] <Cork> i could have sworn...
[00:04:50] <TheJHNZ> http://jsfiddle.net/mv2Lt/1/
[00:04:53] <Cork> TheJHNZ: it was added in 1.7
[00:04:56] <TheJHNZ> ahh
[00:05:05] <TheJHNZ> it opens the field once
[00:05:11] <TheJHNZ> and stops on jfid
[00:05:21] <Cork> TheJHNZ: dose the html you are trying to match exist when the selector runs?
[00:05:25] <z3l> Ok. Thank you.
[00:05:31] <TheJHNZ> http://jsfiddle.net/mv2Lt/1/
[00:05:34] <z3l> It is so hard working on someone elses code.
[00:05:41] <Cork> ugg... wrong nick >_>
[00:05:59] <Cork> z3l: where you run the on( code
[00:06:12] <Cork> do console.log($(selector).length);
[00:06:21] <z3l> ok
[00:06:33] <Cork> if the value is 0 the element doesn't exist when you run the selector
[00:06:55] <TheJHNZ> here we go
[00:06:56] <TheJHNZ> http://jsfiddle.net/mv2Lt/2/
[00:07:02] <z3l> Cork: Am I selecting it properly anyway ?
[00:07:22] <Cork> z3l: yes it is valid if the element exist before the selector
[00:07:27] <Cork> else you need to use delegate
[00:08:15] <Cork> TheJHNZ: do you get this error in your page too? => TypeError: jQuery.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[00:08:32] <TheJHNZ> cork: http://jsfiddle.net/mv2Lt/2/
[00:08:33] <TheJHNZ> go to that one
[00:08:39] <TheJHNZ> i had the wrong jq versiob
[00:10:32] <koneko> hi guys

[00:17:28] <VectorX> TheJHNZ u had posted it before but here it is again
[00:17:30] <VectorX> http://bit.ly/JuA4Z7 when your click below "Shopping Cart" on the header middle, it drops down and when you move the move out closes, and click again drops down, anyone see why it would not be working here http://bit.ly/1craLhO
[00:19:01] <TheJHNZ> it works on mine
[00:19:02] <TheJHNZ> ?
[00:19:16] <TheJHNZ> on firefoxd
[00:19:18] <TheJHNZ> on firefox
[00:19:33] <TheJHNZ> oh you mean when you try and click it again
[00:19:36] <TheJHNZ> hmm
[00:19:42] <TheJHNZ> you might need to reset something
[00:19:42] <VectorX> yes
[00:20:18] <VectorX> TheJHNZ been looking for 2 days but i cant find it
[00:24:17] <Cork> VectorX: might be you are replacing the elements constructing the cart
[00:24:25] <Cork> so you lose the old event handlers and similar things
[00:26:36] <VectorX> Cork i have not changed the code though, just the div ids
[00:28:15] <zulcc> for some weird reason my vimperator doesnt let me enter a css search-term, VectorX which .js contains the code handling cart-total?
[00:29:17] <grafi> VectorX the page where it works is using live, so Cork is probably right
[00:29:51] <VectorX> zulcc its in the common.js
[00:30:07] <VectorX> just the
[00:30:15] <VectorX> block with /* Ajax Cart */
[00:31:00] <zulcc> the problem is, that youre binding the click action to the #cart itself
[00:31:22] <VectorX> im getting Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'live'   with live
[00:31:27] <zulcc> once fiddled with, the binder is gone. bind you on click action to the containing parent instead and point to #cart
[00:31:47] <Cork> VectorX: live is depricated and removed
[00:31:53] <grafi> VectorX $('#header-cart').on('click', '#cart > .heading a' , function() { put that in instead of $('#cart > .heading a').on('click', function() {
[00:32:03] <Cork> the new syntax is delegate, and you find it on the api page for on
[00:33:02] <VectorX> grafi that did it
[00:33:09] <VectorX> thanks guys, life savers
[00:33:24] <Cork> VectorX: be sure to read up on the on command
[00:33:33] <Cork> it will save you time in the future
[00:33:36] <Cork> ?api on

[00:34:16] <VectorX> Cork yeah when i saw deprecated i assumed just a change of name in this case, but ill do that, next time i run accross this
[00:34:34] <Cork> VectorX: live was replaced with delegate
[00:34:48] <Cork> and then bind and delegate was combined into a combo function named on

[00:36:28] <zulcc> im trying to use this on a class rather than just an id http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/
[00:36:58] <zulcc> but when having a previously set time value in the text input, it breaks the functionality of that picker adapting to the previously given datetime
[00:37:21] <Cork> zulcc: sounds like it might be a bug in the plugin
[00:37:46] <Cork> you could try something like $('.class-name').each(function() { $(this).datetimepicker(); });
[00:38:09] <Cork> (if that helps file a bug towards the plugin)
[00:38:20] <zulcc> the thing always starts in the 1970's, cant force my users to scroll to 2014 every time :/
[00:38:33] <zulcc> Cork: i'll try that, thanks
[00:40:22] <krambiorix> Cork, a bit late , but thanks for your help!!!
[00:40:31] <Cork> np
[00:43:05] <dadonp> Might it be OK to ask a question that may or may not be related to a plugin of jQuery?
[00:43:15] <dadonp> and the theme roller
[00:43:21] <fabioportieri> o/
[00:43:41] <VectorX> by the way guys, give the issue with opencart using .live, does this mean the opencart code is using outdated libraries ?
[00:44:57] <dadonp> If I do this: <a class="ui-button ui-state-default">test</a> I get a border around it, but with zero padding
[00:45:30] <dadonp> I tried lightness and darkness, both have no padding. But when I see the demos and examples, including DataTables, all buttons and widgets have a padding.
[00:46:13] <dadonp> The result is that the DataTables buttons are all mashed together. What style class should I use to get the same padding that every widget has for the theme?
[00:47:31] <zulcc> each didnt work either, and adding value: $(this).value in .datetimepicker({ options }) didnt work either, while i doubt that would be appropriate syntax anyways http://apaste.info/et78
[00:51:54] <zulcc> dadonp: sound like you are also including a reset css with some other css files... just a guess
[00:52:22] <dadonp> zulcc: hmmmm.
[00:52:32] <crocket> does anyone know what $$() is?
[00:53:01] <zulcc> sometimes when you inlcude .css from different plugins/projects, you might come across one that resets all paddings and margins to 0. some people like to work all the settings from the ground up to recieve browser compatibility
[00:53:05] <fabioportieri> an alias
[00:53:38] <dadonp> zulcc: or something im missing?
[00:53:40] <zulcc> when you have one .css in there that does reset, your other settings might be overwritten and zeroed, depending on .css inclusion order or importance of the settings
[00:53:53] <grafi> crocket in chrome devtools its a shortcut to documentQuerySelectorAll i think
[00:55:00] <dadonp> Just to make sure, if I want some new widget, I should use class="ui-widget ui-state-default" as an example, right?
[00:55:07] <dadonp> It should come with it's own padding most likely.
[00:58:05] <dadonp> Man, I dont understand any of of this.
[01:00:48] <zulcc> * { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; } in a css after the one defining ui-widget or ui-state-default, and you can kiss "it's own padding" good-bye
[01:01:00] <dadonp> Using the official URL it seems to work, using my downloaded themes (I got them all) it does not.
[01:01:48] <Cork> zulcc: that should depend on how specific the selector is
[01:03:10] <Cork> zulcc: http://jsfiddle.net/j6NH2/
[01:03:22] <dadonp> Naw, still no padding in my tables.
[01:03:55] <Cork> dadonp: inspect the td and see what rule wins
[01:04:18] <Cork> then specify a rule that is more specific with the paddings you want
[01:05:02] <dadonp> Hmm. I choose inspect element and I see a bunch of stuff is crossed over
[01:05:23] <Cork> ya, the one where padding isn't crossed over is what you want
[01:05:30] <Cork> it is the winning rule
[01:06:04] <zulcc> Cork: ah. hm. true... http://jsfiddle.net/j6NH2/1/
[01:06:18] <dadonp> Ok, so if I just wanted to make anything look like it's a widget, how do I do it?
[01:06:36] <dadonp> <p class="ui-widget">this should look like what exactly?</p>
[01:07:13] <dadonp> I know ui-corner-all, ui-widget-content, etc, but none of them give me any padding.
[01:07:19] <Cork> dadonp: that would depend on what other rules apply to that element
[01:07:33] <Cork> dadonp: so the question can't be answered generically
[01:07:54] <dadonp> Ok, let me rephrase, I have a input in a form, what style should it have to be "conforming" to the theme?
[01:08:08] <Cork> dadonp: try making a minimalistic reproduction of the problem in jsfiddle
[01:08:32] <Cork> dadonp: have you disabled apperance on the element?
[01:08:43] <dadonp> No.
[01:08:45] <Cork> else that might have an effect
[01:09:02] <Cork> but basically all i can do without seeing the problem is giving potshots
[01:10:47] <zulcc> is $(this) referencing the correct element here? http://apaste.info/et78
[01:11:27] <Cork> zulcc: this will correlate to what ever is defined in the callback of load
[01:11:35] <Cork> so most likely $('#cont')
[01:11:35] <dadonp> Cork: do I always have to initialize the widget in javascript?
[01:11:50] <Cork> dadonp: if you want the widget functionality; yes
[01:11:54] <Cork> if you just want the style; no
[01:12:06] <dadonp> Cork: ok, then I'm lost
[01:12:13] <dadonp> what style should I use to get a button for instance?
[01:12:49] <Cork> ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all
[01:13:11] <Cork> the corner part isn't a must, but you will get square corners without it
[01:13:42] <Cork> dadonp: simplest is to just inspect a rendered element in jqueryui.com
[01:13:45] <dadonp> Cork: using only the styles gives no padding
[01:13:49] <Cork> and then just adding those classes to the element
[01:14:01] <dadonp> I have, I've copy pasted the button examples.
[01:14:16] <dadonp> As soon as I don't initialize the widget, the padding is gone.
[01:14:17] <Cork> the padding comes from ui-button-text
[01:14:20] <Cork> it is a child span
[01:14:25] <tobago> can anybody explain me why this: https://gist.github.com/trinibago/8002148 fails calling "this" insidethe jQuery.get?
[01:14:43] <Cork> dadonp: ya, cause the button element doesn't have padding
[01:14:43] <zulcc> how would you point to exactly this object with class .datetimepicker within those settings?
[01:14:51] <tobago> the window.clearTimeout simply is not called.
[01:14:55] <dadonp> Cork: why does it have padding when initialized?
[01:14:55] <Cork> zulcc: you can't
[01:15:21] <dadonp> or rather, how can I make my element look as IF it was a themed jquery UI widget without it being one
[01:15:24] <Cork> zulcc: you would have to loop the matching classes
[01:15:50] <zulcc> :( alright, thanks
[01:15:59] <Cork> zulcc: $('.datetimepicker').each(function() { $(this).datetimepicker({ format: 'd.m.Y h:m:s', value: $(this).val() }) });
[01:16:11] <Cork> zulcc: the {} you send to datatimepicker is just an object
[01:16:25] <Cork> zulcc: it is just values and it executes BEFORE datetimepicker executes
[01:16:46] <Cork> dadonp: again, please make a live example of what your trying to do
[01:18:04] <dadonp> http://jsbin.com/IvIHutI/1/edit
[01:18:50] <Cork> dadonp: http://jsbin.com/IvIHutI/2/edit
[01:18:51] <dadonp> Cork: it's a nightmare because the jsbin thingy doesnt play nice with my clipboard
[01:19:16] <dadonp> Cork: why must it be on a span?
[01:19:24] <dadonp> where can I find information on what styles apply to what elements?
[01:19:27] <Cork> cause that is what the theme expects
[01:19:39] <Cork> dadonp: inspect the jquery ui generated element
[01:19:58] <dadonp> Oh, it adds a span
[01:20:03] <Cork> yes
[01:20:18] <dadonp> Hm, unfortunately, the DataTables buttons are generated byt js
[01:20:45] <Cork> dadonp: so just add the padding you need with a class
[01:20:59] <Cork> s/class/selector/
[01:21:30] <dadonp> Cork: what if I want a container widget?
[01:21:37] <Cork> container?
[01:21:42] <dadonp> Yeah, just a holder.
[01:21:49] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[01:21:56] <dadonp> just a div with shit in it
[01:22:15] <dadonp> I've added the corners and the background gray color from the theme using ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corners-all
[01:22:20] <dadonp> but its still missing the padding
[01:22:47] <dadonp> Like a GtkFrame
[01:23:10] <zulcc> Cork: turns out it doesn't accept the current date in the input given its own 'format:' option, only takes it in default-US date format
[01:23:25] <dadonp> or QGroupBox perhaps.
[01:24:01] <Cork> dadonp: so do something like this http://jsbin.com/IvIHutI/3/edit
[01:24:18] <Cork> dadonp: it's just css nothing magical about it
[01:24:38] <Cork> zulcc: nice...
[01:25:11] <dadonp> Cork: are you kidding me. It's the most complex UI system ever created
[01:25:23] <Cork> dadonp: far from it
[01:25:41] <Cork> if you think css is the most complex one created you haven't check many of them
[01:25:45] <dadonp> ive written literally hundreds of gtk and qt apps, even with qt's styles and gtk's rc engine, css is a  hundredfold more complex
[01:26:04] <Cork> dadonp: css can be complex, if you want it to
[01:26:13] <Cork> and yes you can overcomplicate things if you like
[01:26:25] <dadonp> Cork: "yeah your button is formatted right because caveat Y31131 in version 55 of predraft 3 in HTML 5.113.1-2011 says that naming your style 'harold
[01:26:29] <dadonp> ' is indeed invalid"
[01:26:38] <Cork> O_o
[01:27:02] <Cork> dadonp: css != html
[01:27:08] <dadonp> same with CSS
[01:27:14] <Cork> and yes the default styling of some elements is a mess
[01:27:15] <Cork> no
[01:27:29] <Cork> css is very straight forward
[01:27:34] <dadonp> Cork: the papers describing how a UA should treat CSS is huge
[01:27:46] <Cork> sure, it is specific
[01:28:04] <Cork> it's cause contrary to qt and similar several engines need to implement the same thing
[01:28:10] <Cork> and all need to treat things the same way
[01:28:33] <dadonp> Cork: and yet, something as simple as centering something or making a table out of divs is very complex. Compared to any toolkit where you just set the packing alignment.
[01:28:43] <Cork> though this is getting more and more off topic
[01:28:47] <dadonp> Cork: indeed.
[01:28:52] <Cork> dadonp: no it isn't
[01:29:11] <Cork> you just have to check what rule apply to the element
[01:29:13] <dadonp> Cork: compared to programming it, I feel so.
[01:29:14] <Cork> and set what you want
[01:29:22] <Cork> dadonp: it's just different
[01:29:27] <dadonp> centering a widget in Gtk is just one attribute change away
[01:29:38] <Cork> dadonp: in programming you normally don't have default styling added
[01:29:41] <dadonp> in any case, OT, as you said
[01:29:50] <luke_66> hi everyone
[01:30:04] <Cork> if you remove the theme and just add what you want your self you would be at the same position as other styling situations
[01:30:26] <Cork> dadonp: you expect throwing a few values on an element should magically make what you want happen, and that is where you get stuck
[01:30:48] <dadonp> Cork: no, I expect that class="ui-widget" would make it look like a widget. :)
[01:30:56] <Cork> dadonp: exactly
[01:31:18] <Cork> but it is just a style class, not a programing class with features
[01:31:36] <dadonp> Cork: I just need the look, not the features
[01:31:41] <Cork> dadonp: meaning the css class adds the values defined for that rule, nothing else
[01:31:57] <Cork> if you want the css rule to apply add the same structure
[01:32:01] <Cork> it is as simple as that
[01:32:10] <Cork> if you want add the structure, modify the rules
[01:32:29] <dadonp> Well, this doesn't help me since DataTables generate their own elements
[01:32:37] <Cork> sure it does
[01:32:55] <Cork> just add the rules to style the element the way you want it
[01:33:08] <Cork> rules != classes on the element
[01:33:27] <dadonp> Cork: I meant DataTables table, it's supposed to work with theme roller
[01:33:30] <dadonp> the header, for instance, has "<div class="fg-toolbar ui-toolbar ui-widget-header ui-corner-tl ui-corner-tr ui-helper-clearfix">
[01:33:37] <Cork> sigh
[01:33:43] <dadonp> but that header has no padding, probably because it has the wrong structure then
[01:33:50] <Cork> if it creates a structure that doesn't work
[01:33:55] <Cork> there is only two options
[01:33:59] <Cork> 1. patch the plugin
[01:34:04] <Cork> or add special rules
[01:34:14] <Cork> i don't see why you complain about simple facts
[01:34:18] <dadonp> 3. Ask someone if there exists a table plugin that works with themeroller?
[01:34:25] <dadonp> Cork: I'm not complaining, I'm asking
[01:35:11] <Cork> i think i looked at a grid plugin a few years back
[01:35:15] <Cork> ?g jqgrid
[01:35:16] <b-ot> Cork: jqGrid: jQuery Grid Plugin ‚Üí http://www.trirand.com/
[01:35:28] <dadonp> You do all your tables manually?
[01:35:41] <Cork> i wrote my own grid plugin
[01:35:52] <Cork> back when there was only jqgrid and one other plugin
[01:36:04] <Cork> (and now days i've moved over to plain tables)
[01:36:27] <dadonp> probably less headaches
[01:36:46] <tobago> how to assign "this" to jQuery.get to process it in the response function?
[01:36:51] <Cork> well the design changed to the point where the plugin didn't make sense anymore
[01:37:06] <Cork> tobago: you can't
[01:37:17] <Cork> only $.ajax has the context option
[01:37:27] <Cork> tobago: though you can use var self = $(this); before the call
[01:37:32] <Cork> and use self in the callback
[01:42:40] <luke_66> I need to modify a jquery selection, specifically to insert a cloned item after one in a specific position. I've tried with this but didn't work for me: http://jsfiddle.net/Uk722/1/
[01:42:44] <luke_66> any help?
[01:50:56] <koneko> luke_66, could you provide the HTML as well and load jQuery to the fiddle, then hit update and copy the new link?
[01:51:08] <koneko> With this we can't see what you're trying to do
[01:52:31] <koneko> By the way tr_odd_elems[0] won't return a jQuery object so you can't run .clone() on it
[01:53:29] <koneko> You can use .first() to fetch only the first one, or .eq() to fetch a specific one

[02:00:15] <koneko> ?jsfiddle
[02:00:24] <koneko> Darn, what was it here
[02:00:33] <koneko> Tomashe, could you create a jsfiddle with the code?
[02:02:23] <seutje> Tomashe: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/Hey6T/
[02:02:32] <Tomashe> hmm
[02:03:00] <seutje> maybe .hidden-product_upload is already the input?
[02:03:06] <seutje> impossible to know without the markup
[02:03:28] <koneko> Why do you have $(this) as the second parameter of on?
[02:03:38] <seutje> cause he did as well
[02:03:49] <seutje> he's not using it though
[02:03:54] <koneko> this is nothing at that point
[02:03:56] <luke_66> koneko, sorry, fixed the clone() line: http://jsfiddle.net/Uk722/2/. Anyway seems that adding an element at a specific position in a jquery selection it quite tricky
[02:04:08] <seutje> Tomashe: did you mean to pass a selector to .on()?
[02:05:15] <seutje> luke_66: what is this suppose to do besides error out?
[02:06:08] <Tomashe> yes
[02:06:10] <Tomashe> wait
[02:06:16] <Tomashe> let me see it , from some reason its not loading
[02:06:52] <luke_66> seutje, i'm tryng to add the cloned item as a new selection item, specifically after the secon selection item
[02:07:02] <luke_66> *second
[02:07:21] <koneko> luke_66, some markup would help, but cl_o doesn't seem to be defined as well
[02:07:24] <seutje> what's "a new selection item"
[02:08:26] <luke_66> koneko, you're right ...
[02:08:49] <koneko> luke_66, http://jsfiddle.net/Uk722/3/ here it somewhat works, not sure if that's what you wanted to achieve
[02:09:13] <luke_66> seutje, insert the cloned item in tr_odd_elems on third position
[02:10:56] <seutje> well if u add a column, you have to iterate over all the other rows and add one as well, or increase colspan on one of the cells
[02:12:21] <luke_66> koneko, i'll try it. I've tried with insertAfter, but the new item has been added to the second item of selection, so tr_odd_elems.length=4 insetad of 5. Thanks
[02:14:18] <seutje> luke_66: you have to re-evaluate a query for the resultset to update
[02:14:54] <Tomashe> seutje
[02:14:57] <Tomashe> this is not what i ment
[02:15:03] <Tomashe> did u see my example?
[02:17:23] <seutje> Tomashe: yeah, but it doesn't rly make a lot of sense without any context
[02:19:24] <seutje> luke_66: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Uk722/5/
[02:25:04] <Tomashe> hmm
[02:25:12] <Tomashe> im trying to make ajax upload
[02:25:28] <Tomashe> so i want that on change it will run this other function and pass the event to it
[02:25:29] <luke_66> seutje, tnx!
[02:25:43] <M3kH> Good Morning!
[02:25:56] <Tomashe> as u can see : function uploadFiles(event) < need to pass an event
[02:26:03] <seutje> Tomashe: event object is always passed to the handler
[02:26:08] <seutje> as per the docs
[02:26:26] <seutje> -> .on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler(eventObject) )
[02:26:29] <Tomashe> .on('change', uploadFiles()); < so that will work?
[02:26:34] <seutje> lost the brackets
[02:26:42] <seutje> you're passing the function, not the return value
[02:26:45] <Tomashe> why?
[02:26:50] <seutje> .on('change', uploadfiles)
[02:26:58] <seutje> because uploadfiles doesn't return a function
[02:27:09] * seutje checks to make sure
[02:27:12] <seutje> nope, it doesn't
[02:27:33] <seutje> you want the event system to call uploadFiles when the event fires, not when you are binding it
[02:27:43] <Tomashe> yeah
[02:28:00] <seutje> so pass the function, don't execute it
[02:28:04] <Tomashe> but when i lose the brackets its not excuting
[02:28:41] <Tomashe> if i put an alert there, its not firing it
[02:28:45] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/Hey6T/1/
[02:28:48] <seutje> it is for me
[02:29:04] <seutje> guess there's other magic happening on your page I can't debug without ever seeing it
[02:30:24] <seutje> guess this is more analogues to your example: http://jsfiddle.net/Hey6T/2/
[02:31:07] <Tomashe> so why my example istn workigng admit
[02:32:25] <seutje> recreate it in a fiddle and I can try to help
[02:32:38] <seutje> but it's rather impossible for me to guess what else is on the page
[02:33:28] <Tomashe> can i pm?
[02:33:35] <Tomashe> ok no need
[03:03:08] <m0eelo> hi guys, can i use deferred in a webworker? i need to call a function in the mainthread and have to wait for the answer befor executing the rest of the function in the worker...
[03:03:34] <regedit> laboring wife shipped off to the hospital... now, where was i? ah yes, ajax url encoding mm...
[03:05:13] <regedit> how come stuff comes out on server side all url encoded? after much back-n-forth in ##php they're all convinced it's something on the jquery side
[03:05:26] <regedit> using getJSON
[03:05:46] <Cork> regedit: how are you sending it?
[03:06:17] <regedit> passing an object, contains some nested array or 2
[03:06:24] <seutje> m0eelo: have the main thread pass the data once it's ready?
[03:06:40] <seutje> don't think you can pass the promise to the webworker
[03:06:48] <Cork> regedit: code please
[03:07:15] <ppl> hi, how to make return string values in jQuery?.. eg: $("a:glabtext()") == $("a").texts()
[03:07:34] <Cork> ppl: $('a').text()
[03:07:41] <ppl> hi, how to make return string values in jQuery?.. eg: $("a:glabtext()") == $("a").map(function() {return $(this).text()})
[03:07:51] <seutje> lol
[03:08:24] <Cork> ?api glabtext
[03:08:24] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[03:08:38] <ppl> $.extend($.expr[":"], function(el,i,m) {return 'some text'})
[03:08:47] <m0eelo> yes
[03:09:31] <regedit> Cork: http://pastebin.com/QB67hG8j
[03:09:40] <seutje> ppl: that conditional will never eval to true afaict
[03:09:49] <m0eelo> the function in the main needs some time to do it and then posts the message to the worker
[03:10:23] <ppl> <a>111</a><a>222</a><a>333</a>       $.extend($.expr[":"], {'glabtext':function(el,i,m) {return $(this)text()}});                   // i want like result         $("a:texts") => [111,222,333]
[03:10:31] <regedit> Cork: you can see me there trying to mess back-n-forth with decoding URI component
[03:10:53] <Cork> regedit: do a console.log(JSON.stringify(req)) just before the ajax call
[03:11:06] <regedit> Cork: trying...
[03:11:10] <Cork> and check if its encoded there
[03:11:24] <regedit> Cork: BTW FYI it's unicode data, if it makes any difference
[03:11:31] <regedit> non-ascii
[03:11:38] <Cork> regedit: everything in js is unicode
[03:11:43] <regedit> hm ok
[03:11:57] <regedit> it's like a foreign RTL language
[03:13:34] <regedit> Cork: the text appears rendered in its actual language text, not encoded in any way
[03:14:03] <regedit> Cork: i should note that the array *values* do come out fine, but the array *key* seems to get all url encoding stuck
[03:14:30] <Cork> regedit: you are talking about the data you send right?
[03:14:35] <regedit> yes
[03:14:36] <Cork> not what you get back in js?
[03:14:41] <regedit> correct
[03:14:48] <regedit> the req before it gets ajaxed
[03:14:52] <Cork> well you arn't sending json
[03:14:55] <Cork> you sending params
[03:14:56] <seutje> ppl: selectors are meant for selecting elements, textnodes are excluded
[03:15:09] <Cork> and that needs to be url encoded if it isn't plain ascii
[03:15:30] <regedit> Cork: i had understood that ajax can request-ify objects as well? or am i horribly wrong about that...
[03:15:41] <Cork> you can't
[03:15:53] <Cork> you can stringify json and send that as a value
[03:15:57] <Cork> or you can use params
[03:15:59] <Cork> but not objects
[03:16:00] <regedit> well that explains it then
[03:16:13] <Cork> objects will be converted to params by jquery
[03:16:23] <regedit> oh?
[03:16:29] <regedit> well shouldnt that work then?
[03:16:55] <Cork> { key: 'value', key2: [1,2,3]} => ?key=value&key2[]=1&key2[]=2&key2[]=3
[03:16:58] <regedit> i confuse
[03:17:07] <regedit> hang on leme study that
[03:17:31] <Cork> but the data in params will be url encoded
[03:18:33] <Cork> { key: 'test pÂ dÂ 123' } => ?key=test%20p%C3%A5%20d%C3%A5%20123
[03:18:58] <Cork> and you need to handle that server side
[03:19:24] <Cork> cause you arn't allowed to use unicode in urls, proxies and so forth doesn't support it
[03:19:45] <regedit> Cork: does it make sense that this is only an issue on keys, but not on values?
[03:19:58] <Cork> keys should be the same thing
[03:20:49] <regedit> i'm not sure why my values do come through ok-ish (after i decodeURIComponent on the js side before requesting), just the keys remain tangled in url encoding
[03:21:01] <Cork> { 'ÂÎÔ': 10 }  => ?%C3%A5%C3%AB%C3%AF=10
[03:21:47] <seutje> most server side languages handle it automagically though
[03:21:52] <Cork> ya
[03:22:08] <regedit> that seems to be the case...for values
[03:22:29] <Cork> regedit: though i would argue not to use none ascii in keys
[03:22:30] <regedit> if i decodeURIcomponent the key, it comes URL encoded on the server (php). if i don't, it comes as weird bytes
[03:23:43] <regedit> whereas the value, if i decodeURIcomponent the value it comes as expected on the server (php). if i don't, it comes url encoded
[03:23:55] <regedit> why is it different betw key/value....
[03:24:03] <Cork> regedit: unless you have it encoded in your variables js side
[03:24:09] <Cork> you shouldn't have to decode it before you send it
[03:24:17] <Cork> actually decoding it shouldn't do anything
[03:25:09] <regedit> i think the values are originally URL encoded, but i want them to appear as "naked" as possible so i decode them, wanting to rely on jquery's encoding and PHP's decoding
[03:25:59] <regedit> seems to work as planned for value, strangely enough not the same for key...
[03:26:05] <Cork> regedit: well console.log the original data and you should be able to tell
[03:26:42] <Cork> regedit: what $.ajax does is taking the object you give it and pass it through $.param()
[03:26:51] <Cork> you can test run your data to see what happens if you like
[03:27:05] <Cork> $.param({ 'ÂÎÔ': 10 })  => "%C3%A5%C3%AB%C3%AF=10"
[03:27:36] <regedit> 'tis hebrew i'm dealing with
[03:27:39] <regedit> {"action":"oz_testage","filters":{"◊†◊ï◊©◊ê":["◊†◊ï◊©◊ê-1"]}}
[03:27:47] <regedit> y'all clients probably rendered that wrong
[03:28:00] <regedit> one square bracket is twisted RTL
[03:28:49] <ThoMe> hiho
[03:28:50] <Cork> regedit: and you really must have none ascii in the keys?
[03:29:04] <ThoMe> i have code like $('.entryAdd').click(function(e) { ..
[03:29:05] <regedit> the last part is really  "filters":{"KEY":["VAL"]}
[03:29:16] <Cork> ya i get the structure
[03:29:17] <ThoMe> but when i add a table row with append() then this: $('.entryAdd').click(function(e) { doesnt works
[03:29:23] <Cork> regedit: and you really must have none ascii in the keys? <--
[03:29:26] <ThoMe> i need a event manager or?
[03:29:55] <Cork> ThoMe: you most likely want to use delegated event listener
[03:30:04] <ThoMe> Cork: "on" ?
[03:30:09] <regedit> Cork: would be most convenient that way...... no hopes for just cracking down on the mistery here?
[03:30:10] <Cork> ThoMe: $().click will only add event listeners to the elements taht exists in the dom
[03:30:14] <Cork> ThoMe: yes, and no
[03:30:23] <ThoMe> Cork: hm.
[03:30:25] <Cork> ThoMe: a specific form of on that's called delegate
[03:30:29] <regedit> *mystery
[03:30:37] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com delegate
[03:30:39] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation ‚Üí http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:30:44] <Cork> read up on that page
[03:30:51] <kristofe_> Hey, i'm trying to use this slider on a site, and making an ajax call to an api
[03:30:52] <kristofe_> http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/examples/connected-carousels/
[03:31:08] <kristofe_> the slider works fine with html, but if i append the data from the ajax call it doesn't
[03:31:28] <ThoMe> Cork: i change it from $('.entryAdd').click(function(e) { to $('.entryAdd').on('click',function() { is it correct?
[03:32:44] <ThoMe> Cork: hmm. no. $('.entryDelete').on('click',function() { doesnt works.
[03:32:44] <ThoMe> hmm.
[03:32:49] <ThoMe> not after append
[03:32:50] <Cork> ..
[03:32:53] <Cork> read the link
[03:32:55] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com delegate
[03:32:56] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation ‚Üí http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:33:17] <Cork> TheJHNZ: that is why i didn't point you at on, cause you most likely would use it wrong
[03:33:33] <Cork> you can use on, but read delegate first
[03:36:51] <ThoMe> Cork: ah.. ok. $("#dnsEntriesTable tbody").on("click", '.entryDelete', function () { works now :-)
[03:37:15] <regedit> Cork: looks like $.param() encodes the square brackets too, which might be throwing off the multibyte... or something like that
[03:37:21] <regedit> Cork: is that a bug?
[03:37:56] <Zac12> anyone here using https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it ?
[03:38:10] <Cork> regedit: the brackets?
[03:38:13] <Cork> in the key you mean?
[03:38:15] <Zac12> and anyone know why I can't get this to work? https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it#removetagbylabeltaglabel-animate
[03:38:30] <Zac12> removeAll works but not removeTagByLabel
[03:38:32] <Zac12> :/
[03:38:41] <Cork> regedit: no that is expected
[03:38:55] <regedit> Cork: &filters%5B%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%90%5D%5B%5D=%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%90-1 <-- note the %5B and %5D at the key extremeties
[03:39:06] <Cork> [] isn't allowed in urls
[03:39:13] <Cork> so ya that is expected
[03:39:17] <Zac12> the example calls it : removeTagByName but I've tried that to and no luck: http://aehlke.github.io/tag-it/examples.html
[03:39:52] <regedit> Cork: any reason you'd know why that might not decode as expected on the server side? or is that out of scope here
[03:40:55] <Cork> regedit: i would check that &filters%5B%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%90%5D%5B%5D=%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%90-1 is really what is transmitted cross the wire
[03:41:06] <Cork> regedit: if it is, it sounds like a bug server side
[03:41:31] <Cork> regedit: but like i've said before; and you seam to ignore; i recommend to never use anything but ascii in keys
[03:41:37] <Cork> values should work just fine
[03:42:11] <Cork> it's a bunch of pointless pain for no reason
[03:43:18] <regedit> Cork: i did mention it would be awefully convenient for me, but where indeed are the docs / official word about this issue with keys? in JS alone it works fine, in PHP alone it works fine
[03:43:40] <Cork> regedit: the problem is that url isn't unicode
[03:43:47] <regedit> ok
[03:43:57] <Cork> so you need to convert everything to ascii with url encoding
[03:44:03] <regedit> right
[03:44:07] <Cork> and then the other end needs to parse and convert it back
[03:44:14] <Cork> and ya, php isn't the best at that
[03:44:36] <Cork> and from experience it is by far the simplest to just never use anything but ascii in keys
[03:44:49] <regedit> i guess it's back to ##php then... or just give up on this (aweful indeed) convenience
[03:44:52] <Cork> it shouldn't be a problem as long as you keep that structure in the app
[03:45:23] <regedit> what structure in the app? you mean within JS alone?
[03:45:26] <Cork> regedit: similar problems would exist with databases too
[03:45:54] <Cork> regedit: my own rule is to only use english variable names, keys, database columns and so on
[03:46:06] <Cork> it usually makes life M-U-C-H easier down the line
[03:46:23] <regedit> herm...
[03:46:26] <Cork> some languages handle unicode very well (js is among the best there)
[03:46:43] <Cork> but protocols are normally very ascii sentric
[03:47:26] <Zac12> anyome
[03:47:28] <Zac12> one ?
[03:48:09] <regedit> zentrisch
[04:19:21] <zhulikas> how can I make jquerymobile override URLs when it changes pages?
[04:21:19] <Zac12> anyone here using https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it ?
[05:04:52] <gratz> There is elem.click and elem.key* (keypress, keyup, keydown etc), but is there an all encompassing event handler for user interaction with a button for example in jquery - so the button could have been clicked or tabbed to with the keyboard and space pressed..
[05:24:18] <Cork> grafi: well click should trigger if the user in anyway do an action on the button
[05:24:34] <Cork> even if it is space, enter click touch tap and so on
[05:24:56] <Cork> focus is a totally separate event handler and no there isn't anything that grabs it and the other ones at the same time
[05:25:00] <Cork> *gratz:
[05:25:27] <Cork> gratz: that said, you can give more then one event type to on if you want them all to call the same function
[05:25:48] <Cork> .on('click focus blur', func)
[05:25:56] <gratz> i see
[05:26:05] <Cork> gratz: btw keypress is a depricated and none cross browser event type
[05:26:14] <Cork> use keydown instead
[05:26:24] <Cork> (not jquery specific)
[05:26:27] <gratz> tried space just now and didn't call the function within the click
[05:27:35] <Cork> might be os dependent
[05:27:39] <Cork> but it works fine here for me http://jsfiddle.net/h48NK/
[05:28:48] <gratz> ah i messed up
[05:28:50] <gratz> cheers
[05:29:06] <PereP> hi all
[05:30:05] <PereP> I have implemented some fancy jQuery plugin using this boilerplate: https://github.com/websanova/boilerplate/blob/master/wBoilerplate.js
[05:31:32] <PereP> everything is almost working fine, excepting that the original html element where the plugin is being applied is deleted, and the new generated one is either appended to body (look at the boilerplate, line 58) or "missing"
[05:31:57] <PereP> I want the new element generated by the plugin to be in place of the original one
[05:32:11] <PereP> but I'm stuck at this point
[05:35:19] <PereP> could please someone take a look at the link I posted and tell me what some obvious thing should I change probably in my return to return the new generated element and replace the original one with it??
[05:46:08] <jstroem_> PereP so you want the <div class="_wBoiler_holder" /> element to replace the element in this.$elem ?
[05:46:44] <PereP> hmmm yeah
[05:46:49] <PereP> I'm getting something...
[05:47:40] <jstroem_> PereP: okay then you could just change line 56-58 with $elem.replaceWith(boiler.generate())
[05:47:46] <PereP> I'm replacing the $('body').append (line 58) with something like...
[05:47:54] <PereP> ouch
[05:47:57] <PereP> good point
[05:48:04] <grafi> Cork you evil highlighter :D
[05:48:06] <PereP> I was doing a wrap, replacing contentens and unwrapping
[05:48:43] <Cork> grafi: names too similar :P
[05:48:49] <Cork> rename ;≈
[05:48:56] <grafi> e.g. starts with a g? xD
[05:49:08] <grafi_> better?
[05:49:14] <Cork> :XD
[05:49:16] <jstroem_> PereP: :) always check if the functionality you seek is in the API..
[05:50:09] <PereP> yeah, that's true! I already knew replaceWith() but today I'm feeling a bit slow :/
[05:50:42] <jstroem_> then back to the coffee machine!
[05:50:46] <PereP> anyway there must be something wrong in my code somewhere else
[05:51:03] <PereP> I'm getting a "Uncaught HierarchyRequestError: A Node was inserted somewhere it doesn't belong" error in console
[05:51:40] <PereP> yeah jstroem_, my head starting to work partially only after a cup of cofee about 50 min ago
[05:57:02] <PereP> ok, gotta go... I'm turning off my computer and let my neurones take a break xD
[05:57:08] <PereP> thanks a lot, jstroem_
[05:57:17] <PereP> probably tomorrow I'll be back here xD
[05:57:53] <jstroem> your welcome
[05:58:29] <PereP> bye ;)

[06:29:16] <mridley> so I have what may be a dumb question.  I have a page and I want arrow key navigation to update things when the mouse is over a certain div.  I have this all working fine using .hover, but the problem is that when the new page is loaded and the mouse is in the same position on the page neither .hover() or .mouseover() get triggered until the pointer leaves the area and returns.  But I want the event handler to be attached based on wher
[06:35:24] <NoiseEee> mridley: don't think its possible; you're loading a new document, and it hasn't registered any movement/interaction
[06:35:53] <NoiseEee> mridley: however, CSS should work immediately.
[06:36:43] <mridley> NoiseEee: hm‚Ä¶so would it be possible to somehow do something with CSS that the JS could query and then attach an event handler‚Ä¶? Seems like a possible approach
[06:36:45] <NoiseEee> mridley: so perhaps you can use the onload event (with a settimeout perhaps, to allow for CSS) and check the state of the element, and fire the same method
[06:36:52] <NoiseEee> jinx
[06:37:20] <Cork> mridley: you could set a value on the element and query that value
[06:37:26] <NoiseEee> i'm *assuming* the CSS would immediately work, i don't know for sure though
[06:37:29] <Cork> though.... not really the best solution
[06:37:30] <NoiseEee> or try that too
[06:37:52] <mridley> Cork: oh that's an interesting idea‚Ä¶
[06:38:16] <mridley> Cork: if I can't figure out a way to natively get the hover status from JS, I think I'll go with that - thanks
[06:38:35] <Cork> mridley: you can't get the hover event cause there isn't any
[06:38:47] <Cork> hover comes when the mouse moves
[06:39:18] <mridley> yeah
[06:39:22] <mridley> I guess I'll have to set a value
[06:39:27] <mridley> thanks again
[06:45:41] <herbySk> hello.
[06:46:20] <herbySk> It seems that insertBefore and insertAfter does not work when parent of target is a DocumentFragment.
[06:46:48] <herbySk> Is this a feature or a bug (I tried to find out, but wasn't successful)
[06:46:51] <herbySk> ?
[06:48:21] <Serdar> I hate diets
[06:48:27] <Serdar> can't think anymore
[06:53:49] <seutje> herbySk: seems related: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/210
[06:55:51] <seutje> looks like it was specifically fixed for append/prepent: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/9c28a320c3fa6dcc06de4919d24da41451843570
[07:03:27] <mridley> Cork: thanks again for your help, got it working perfectly by adding a data-hover on the element
[07:17:40] <amitev> hi all! i'm exploring the jquery ui widget api! i see that there is a "destroy" lifecycle method that gets called when the element is removed. however i see that jquery ui dialog which is also a widget could be destroyed manually by calling $(..).dialog("destroy"). my question is - how to capture $().myWidget("destroy") for a custom widget
[07:18:01] <amitev> can't find how this is implemented in the src of jquery ui dialog
[07:21:21] <rohanbhangui> hi all ‚ò∫
[07:21:38] <grafi> ugh
[07:21:43] <grafi> you again

[07:23:46] <grafi> if you know what i mean
[07:23:47] <grafi> o√¥
[07:24:09] <Velveeta> amitev: did you get an answer from anybody yet?
[07:24:18] <amitev> Velveeta: no
[07:24:31] <grafi> Velveeta: Cheese^!
[07:24:44] <Velveeta> amitev: you're just wanting to know how to call the destroy method on your own custom widget?
[07:24:46] <Velveeta> grafi: tis i!
[07:24:51] <grafi> :D
[07:25:06] <amitev> Velveeta: yes, to call it manually
[07:25:19] <amitev> like programatically destroy a widget
[07:25:29] <Velveeta> amitev: it comes baked in as part of the ui factory itself, there's nothing special you need to do to inherit that functionality
[07:25:35] <amitev> without removing the element of course
[07:25:38] <grafi> .deeeeeestroi('it\'s your boi');
[07:26:11] <Velveeta> amitev: yep, the destroy method is part of the factory, all it does is remove the instance data that's bound to the element for the widget, not the element itself
[07:26:13] <amitev> $(...).myWidget("destroy") doesn't call _destroy() method
[07:27:03] <Velveeta> amitev: it should‚Ä¶ if you look at the jquery ui src, within the $.Widget.prototype object, there's a destroy method, the first line of which is: this._destroy()
[07:27:14] <Velveeta> do you have a custom destroy method set up that's overriding this one?
[07:27:32] <Velveeta> if so, you can do your custom stuff and then just call: this._super();
[07:27:36] <amitev> just have _create and _destroy, no others
[07:27:52] <Velveeta> hmmm, and what version of jquery ui are you running?
[07:28:41] <rohanbhangui> grafi love the gifs

[07:34:24] <grafi> PERFECT
[07:34:54] <amitev> Velveeta: jquery ui dialog works perfectly with ("destroy")
[07:35:52] <Velveeta> amitev: i just jumped back in the api documentation, and aside from the fact that from 1.8 -> 1.9, they changed the ability to call methods on an uninstantiated widget, which some people did when they called destroy, nothing else seems to have changed with it
[07:36:07] <Velveeta> amitev: is there a link somewhere where we can see what's going on?
[07:36:23] <Velveeta> jquery ui dialog works fine w/ destroy because destroy is an available function on all widgets created through the widget factory
[07:36:48] <Velveeta> so unless the destroy method is being overridden as part of a new widget's prototype or something, and not chaining through to the _super version of the function, it should just work
[07:37:53] <amitev> Velveeta: i'll try with jsfiddle ;)
[07:37:59] <Velveeta> sounds good
[07:38:33] <rohanbhangui> im just saying
[07:39:27] <rohanbhangui> i know grafi they work im just saying
[07:40:50] <grafi> :P
[07:42:55] <amitev> Velveeta: here it is - http://jsfiddle.net/AHxXq/
[07:43:25] <Velveeta> oh ok, now i see what's going on
[07:44:13] <amitev> the same thing works for jquery ui dialog
[07:44:14] <Velveeta> so, the destroy method that's in the $.Widget.prototype is pointing to the original implementation of _destroy, when you overwrite that function, the other one is still pointing to the original incarnation of _destroy, not your overridden one
[07:44:54] <amitev> omg
[07:45:48] <amitev> idea why does this happen?
[07:45:49] <Velveeta> actually disregard that, i lied
[07:45:49] <Velveeta> because that's evaluated at the time it's executed, it's not a stored reference
[07:46:47] <Velveeta> i'm checking the code in my debugger to see what's going on
[07:47:41] <amitev> is this the right way to manually destroy the widget?
[07:50:55] <Velveeta> ok, here's a problem
[07:51:08] <pbodymind> where where?
[07:51:18] <Velveeta> amitev: looks like in the version of jquery ui you've included in that fiddle, there's no such thing as _destroy()
[07:51:41] <Velveeta> back then, jquery ui only used a destroy method that was public, there was no separation between public and private scope
[07:51:58] <Velveeta> the ui.dialog implementation in that file only uses a "destroy" method also, no _destroy
[07:52:33] <Velveeta> fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/AHxXq/1/
[07:53:03] <pbodymind> amitev: that code is awful.. what u want to do?
[07:54:23] <pbodymind> check this: http://jsfiddle.net/btb46/
[07:56:28] <amitev> Velveeta: thank you very much!
[07:56:34] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[07:57:02] <amitev> pbodymind: wtf?
[07:57:15] <Velveeta> pbodymind: i would say what he wants to do is demonstrate his use case with a minimal-functional example, but thanks for being the asshole criticism
[07:57:26] <amitev> rofl
[07:57:51] <amitev> Velveeta: jquery widgets - i'm doing it wrong
[07:57:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: when i said we need to "help" grafi with his gif addiction i meant take down the dropbox where he stores them
[07:58:15] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: but then where is he supposed to put all his gifs? that's no help at all!
[07:58:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[07:58:47] <jayayseakay> Hey guys, can anyone have a quick look why on staging.dooku.co.uk once the RSVP is clicked and the modal shows the removeGuest click isnt triggering :S
[07:58:54] <grafi> they great thing about dropbox is
[07:59:11] <grafi> i have it all mirrored on all of my devices, cloud yay
[07:59:12] <grafi> ._.
[07:59:34] <amitev> Velveeta: what debugger do you use?
[07:59:45] <Velveeta> grafi: is it mirrored, or is it just pointing at your dropbox instance?
[07:59:59] <Velveeta> amitev: primarily chrome's devtools, unless i have need of debugging something in a specific other browser
[08:00:00] <grafi> mirrored
[08:01:24] <ph88> how can i do something like this ?  http://pastebin.com/A8uRe2Nz
[08:01:49] <grafi> oO
[08:02:09] <ph88> :P
[08:02:25] <grafi> done should be called when when you get a response
[08:02:40] <grafi> i think
[08:02:41] <grafi> ^^
[08:02:57] <Velveeta> no, done can be attached when the request is made
[08:02:59] <ph88> well i check the response header is in the 200 range, but only fail() and always() are getting triggered
[08:03:03] <Velveeta> but he needs to execute func1 as a function
[08:03:10] <Velveeta> func1().done(
[08:03:18] <Velveeta> chain off of the return
[08:03:26] <ph88> oh sorry that was a typo ... i actually do it like that
[08:03:38] <ph88> this.saveReport().done(function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {   <-- straight from my code
[08:03:39] <Velveeta> oh, well then, that should work fine
[08:03:46] <ph88> hhmm weird it doesnt
[08:04:06] <Velveeta> and your saveReport function is actually returning the $.ajax return right? not just executing $.ajax?
[08:04:28] <ph88> well that i wonder ..
[08:04:47] <NoiseEee> ph88:  i tend to take http://pastebin.com/g7btPEag approach
[08:04:54] <ph88> it's the return value of this function http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save   it uses jQuery under the hood
[08:05:42] <Velveeta> ph88: i'm not sure that backbone's save returns the jqxhr object
[08:05:51] <Velveeta> fetch does i'm pretty sure, but not sure about save
[08:06:56] <ph88> Calling save with new attributes will cause a "change" event immediately, a "request" event as the Ajax request begins to go to the server
[08:07:06] <ph88> i see the request going so that's ok
[08:08:27] <Velveeta> if it emits a request event, it may be passing the jqxhr object in as a parameter to that event listener
[08:08:46] <Velveeta> so you may be able to attach .on('request', function (jqxhr) { } ) or something to that, and attach your .done() callback there
[08:09:05] <ph88> i'll have to think about this ^^
[08:09:26] <ph88> i thought it was general jQuery patterns, but maybe it's backbone specific
[08:10:24] <Velveeta> yeah, i mean, it's built with jquery as a dependency, but backbone has its own opinions on implementation
[08:10:35] <ph88> ye i understand
[08:10:36] <Velveeta> but based on what you pasted there, that might be a feasible way of setting that up
[08:13:16] <ph88> ok i'll try to get that approach working before making another one

[08:26:15] <prometh> hi
[08:26:23] <prometh> is it possible to write custom events that work with on() ?
[08:26:30] <prometh> like on("customEvent")
[08:26:41] <prometh> i really don't want $("asdf").customEvent()
[08:34:57] <wer0ckz> Hi guys. I have a dynamic created element. how can i combine bind and on? i have this code: http://pastebin.com/5qzVgQNX
[08:52:51] <prometh> hello?
[08:53:22] <prometh> is it possible to create a custom "click" event? so that $.on("click") doesn't actually capture a click, but instead does something else?
[09:02:19] <richardjs> prometh: What exactly do you mean? Do you mean do something on a click, but not stop the click event?
[09:02:46] <prometh> well, i want to create a plugin that does this:   on("transitionEnd")
[09:02:52] <prometh> which adds vendor prefixes
[09:03:21] <prometh> but if the browser supports "transitionEnd" without the prefix, i'll end up with 2 events
[09:03:31] <prometh> or 2 dispatches, rather
[09:04:05] <prometh> so i'd like "transitionEvent" to always go to my function
[09:08:07] <prometh> :(
[09:11:47] <richardjs> Ok, I think I'm tracking... let me make sure
[09:11:54] <richardjs> You want to listen for transitionEnd events
[09:12:23] <richardjs> But on() adds the vendor prefixes to it automatically? (I didn't realize it did that)
[09:12:29] <richardjs> And thus you'll get two calls to the callback?
[09:12:35] <richardjs> prometh: ^^
[09:12:53] <prometh> no ,i want it to do that
[09:13:06] <prometh> it's a 2 step thing, so i guess i'll stay on step 1 for now
[09:13:15] <prometh> i'd like $.on("transitionEnd") to add vendor prefixes
[09:13:26] <richardjs> ahh, ok
[09:13:29] <prometh> but i can't seem to find any way to extend on() like that
[09:14:17] <richardjs> is "transitionEnd" just an example (meaning, you want it for any generic event), or is it the only case?
[09:14:39] <prometh> that's the only case
[09:15:04] <prometh> transitionEnd won't work for a few years, so we have to use webkitTransitionEnd/etc for now
[09:15:10] <prometh> but i'd like to dumb down the on()
[09:15:29] <prometh> instead of doing $("asdf").transitionEnd()
[09:16:17] <richardjs> ah, ok, I understand now (also noticed your first set of messages ~10:25, which I missed)
[09:17:10] <duch_kazatel> prometh there are 4 variations on transitionEnd so you'll need to cover all of them - transitionend webkitTransitionEnd oTransitionEnd otransitionend
[09:17:39] <prometh> duch_kazatel: yep, i know... but i don't know how to extend on()
[09:17:44] <duch_kazatel> you could create a var like var transitionEndEvents = 'transitionend webkitTransitionEnd oTransitionEnd otransitionend';
[09:18:05] <prometh> duch_kazatel: that won't cover browsers that do not support transitionevents at all
[09:18:25] <richardjs> prometh: have you encountered $.event.trigger? http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-custom-events/
[09:18:41] <prometh> $.trigger() ?
[09:18:42] <duch_kazatel> you actually don't want to extend on - that's an event binding interface.  you should be looking at how jquery handles events in general first.
[09:18:42] <richardjs> prometh: your plugin could listen for the prefixed events, and then $.event.trigger a transition event
[09:19:08] <prometh> oh shit, that's different htan $.trigger
[09:19:12] <prometh> i think that's what i was looking for!
[09:19:24] <prometh> err wait
[09:19:45] <prometh> the only api i want outside of the plugin is $.on("transitionEnd")
[09:19:52] <richardjs> yeah
[09:20:19] <prometh> oh i see
[09:20:29] <prometh> hmm
[09:20:33] <prometh> no i don't
[09:20:35] <richardjs> You basically want to convert the numerous transition events into a single transitionEnd, right?
[09:20:41] <prometh> what will $.on("transitionEnd") trigger?
[09:20:41] <duch_kazatel> prometh you want to capture an event, prevent it, and trigger something else.
[09:20:48] <prometh> duch_kazatel:  yes
[09:20:49] <duch_kazatel> nothing.
[09:21:01] <duch_kazatel> that binds an event handler on the transitionEnd event
[09:21:08] <richardjs> prometh: $.on('transitionEnd') will listen for transitionEnd events
[09:21:21] <prometh> i need $.on("transitionEnd") to trigger a class that adds $.on("webkitTransitionEnd"), etc
[09:21:22] <richardjs> prometh: and you can use $.event.trigger to create a transitionEnd event
[09:21:35] <richardjs> prometh: which is what you'd do in your plugin (if I understand correctly)
[09:21:43] <prometh> yes
[09:21:55] <prometh> but my plugin needs to be initiated by $.on("transitionEnd")
[09:22:03] <prometh> i want to extend on()
[09:22:04] <duch_kazatel> "to trigger a class that adds $.on("webkitTransitionEnd")" - huh?
[09:22:08] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense.
[09:22:13] <prometh> why not?
[09:22:21] <prometh> $.on("customEvent")
[09:22:22] <prometh> that's it
[09:22:23] <duch_kazatel> "to trigger a class"
[09:22:40] <duch_kazatel> JS doesn't have classes.
[09:22:41] <prometh> i don't want to write all kinds of crap in my app
[09:22:50] <prometh> js has pesudo-classes.. let's not get wordy
[09:23:08] <duch_kazatel> no, it has prototypes.  not classes.  you want to bind to a given event and trigger another event.
[09:23:09] <duch_kazatel> right?
[09:23:24] <prometh> i think so
[09:23:30] <duch_kazatel> so you need to explicitly bind to the event(s) you want to listen for and explicitly trigger the other one.
[09:23:37] <prometh> that's messy
[09:23:39] <prometh> i want to wrap it
[09:23:52] <prometh> i don't want to write $.on("asdf;alsdjf ;alsdf a;lsdkfj als;dkfj als;djfas;kldfj") every time
[09:24:05] <duch_kazatel> so $(selector).on('list of events here', function(){$(selector).trigger('event you want to fire')});
[09:24:12] <prometh> too long
[09:24:24] <duch_kazatel> you could write one line that'd handle all of that for you.
[09:24:31] <duch_kazatel> you'd write more lines of code to "extend on"
[09:24:33] <prometh> this is why people do things like $(selector).transitionEnd() which i dont' like
[09:24:59] <prometh> my goal is to attain:  $(selector).on("transitionEnd", function)
[09:25:17] <duch_kazatel> then you'll have to look at the underlying event interface.
[09:25:21] <duch_kazatel> .on() just binds to events.
[09:25:26] <prometh> that's what i'm asking
[09:25:29] <prometh> how can i extend on()
[09:25:38] <prometh> to look for "transitionEnd", and if it finds it, it runs my plugin
[09:25:42] <prometh> if not, it runs super.on(
[09:25:43] <prometh> )
[09:25:52] <duch_kazatel> my first solution provides EXACTLY what you want.
[09:26:04] <prometh> oh :)
[09:26:05] <duch_kazatel> without needing to extend anything.
[09:26:07] <prometh> my apologies
[09:26:37] <prometh> oh, btu there'es 1 thing
[09:26:50] <prometh> what if the browser doesn't support transition events at all ?
[09:26:56] <duch_kazatel> var transitionEndEvents = 'transitionend webkitTransitionEnd oTransitionEnd otransitionend'; $(selector).on(transitionEndEvents, function(){});
[09:26:58] <prometh> that event listener will never be triggered
[09:27:00] <duch_kazatel> then nothing will happen.
[09:27:25] <duch_kazatel> you could add more events to that transitionEndEvents var example I just pasted.
[09:27:33] <prometh> like what?
[09:27:47] <duch_kazatel> whichever ones you want to bind to.
[09:27:52] <duch_kazatel> there are lots of events ;)
[09:28:04] <prometh> but if 'transitionend webkitTransitionEnd oTransitionEnd otransitionend' are never called
[09:28:10] <prometh> nothing will happen
[09:28:14] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[09:28:15] <prometh> i need a default case
[09:28:19] <duch_kazatel> "default case"?
[09:28:33] <prometh> yes, no support for transitions, just call handler
[09:28:34] <duch_kazatel> you must have an event to bind to.
[09:28:44] <prometh> this is why i want to extend on()
[09:28:49] <duch_kazatel> without seeing an example of what you're dealing with, it's hard to help.
[09:28:58] <duch_kazatel> because what you're asking now doesn't make any sense
[09:29:01] <duch_kazatel> you have to bind to events.
[09:29:17] <duch_kazatel> .on() binds a listener that listens for events.
[09:29:27] <prometh> i want to extend on()
[09:29:41] <prometh> like you would with superclasses, etc
[09:29:52] <duch_kazatel> explain this "default case" thing.
[09:29:58] <duch_kazatel> because that makes absolutely no sense so far.
[09:29:59] <prometh> i'm typing it
[09:30:10] <prometh> on("transitionEnd") -> does browser support transitions? -> (yes) -> super.on("webkitTransitionEnd")
[09:30:19] <prometh> on("transitionEnd") -> does browser support transitions? -> (no) -> call handler
[09:31:06] <duch_kazatel> oh, that's why you're confused.
[09:31:06] <duch_kazatel> that second scenario can never happen.
[09:31:06] <duch_kazatel> because the event would never fire.
[09:31:21] <prometh> but if we extended on(), it could
[09:31:29] <prometh> the extended function would be called instead
[09:31:29] <duch_kazatel> no.
[09:31:39] <prometh> jQuery.on = function(){}
[09:31:45] <prometh> jQuery.oldOn = jQuery.on;
[09:31:46] <prometh> etc
[09:31:47] <duch_kazatel> if the browser doesn't support transitionEnd, that second event would never fire.
[09:31:50] <duch_kazatel> period.
[09:31:59] <duch_kazatel> on("transitionEnd") -> does browser support transitions? -> (no) -> call handler
[09:32:01] <prometh> do you know what extending a function means ?
[09:32:04] <duch_kazatel> that scenario cannot happen.
[09:32:05] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[09:32:25] <duch_kazatel> if the browser never fires the event "transitionEnd", how does your second scenario work?
[09:32:31] <duch_kazatel> that makes absolutely no sense.
[09:32:58] <duch_kazatel> you're binding to an event that would never happen.
[09:33:43] <prometh> jQuery.old_on = jQuery.on;     jQuery.on = function(event,funct){ if (browserSupportsTransitions){ jQuery.old_on(event,funct) }else{ funct() }};
[09:33:48] <prometh> extending the function.
[09:34:05] <duch_kazatel> again - if the event never fires, how does your second scenario work?
[09:34:15] <prometh> on() is run, dude
[09:34:18] <prometh> not the handler
[09:34:19] <duch_kazatel> no, it's not.
[09:34:30] <prometh> on delegates to addEventListener(), dude.
[09:34:37] <prometh> on() is a function!
[09:34:40] <prometh> it has code in it
[09:34:41] <duch_kazatel> are you wanting to change the way binding works?
[09:34:42] <prometh> it can be extended
[09:34:45] <prometh> duhhhhh
[09:35:02] <duch_kazatel> then you should have said that.
[09:35:13] <prometh> "extend on"
[09:35:43] <prometh> i need extra logic running wihtin ()
[09:35:46] <prometh> within on()
[09:35:49] <prometh> so it needs to be extended
[09:35:58] <duch_kazatel> imo my first example still works for you.
[09:35:58] <duch_kazatel> add however many events you want to that var - it'll still bind.g
[09:35:58] <prometh> i was asking how to do that
[09:36:07] <duch_kazatel> okay, dude
[09:36:12] <prometh> it will not work if browser does not support transitions
[09:36:15] <prometh> my example will
[09:36:18] <duch_kazatel> you're overcomplicating the problem.
[09:36:25] <prometh> not really.. i want it to work everywhere
[09:36:34] <prometh> it needs to work in ie9
[09:36:35] <duch_kazatel> it will with the example I gave you.
[09:36:47] <prometh> not in ie9 it won't
[09:36:50] <duch_kazatel> you can feed as many events as you'd like as the first arg to .on().
[09:36:59] <prometh> what event would i feed it for it to work in ie9 ?
[09:36:59] <duch_kazatel> even events the IE9 fires.
[09:37:08] <duch_kazatel> whatever event you want to trigger on.
[09:37:15] <prometh> transitionEnd.
[09:37:21] <prometh> it won't trigger.
[09:37:28] <duch_kazatel> you need to shim that event into the browser.
[09:37:35] <prometh> that's what i'm trying to do
[09:37:36] <duch_kazatel> extending .on(); will not do that.
[09:37:45] <prometh> how do you suggest?
[09:38:13] <duch_kazatel> find/develop a shim that inserts that functionality.
[09:38:30] <prometh> .........
[09:38:34] <duch_kazatel> extending .on() is not the way to go for that.
[09:38:36] <prometh> which is the solution i already gave.
[09:38:45] <prometh> how else do you shim an event ?
[09:38:46] <duch_kazatel> .on() is meant to listen for events.
[09:39:01] <duch_kazatel> find a polyfill/shim.
[09:39:49] <prometh> there isn't one
[09:41:41] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/1903/files
[09:41:50] <duch_kazatel> there's one way to do it.
[09:45:54] <prometh> does that work through an on("transitionEnd") ?
[09:45:57] <prometh> or a function?
[09:47:04] <prometh> that works with animate(), dude
[09:47:07] <prometh> not what i'ma fter
[09:47:30] <prometh> but they have extended animate()
[09:47:32] <prometh> as i want to do with on()
[09:50:17] <NoiseEee> why wouldn't you just do your thang on the handler that .on() calls?
[09:51:53] <NoiseEee> i mean, why would you want to 'extend' or overwrite 'on()' when its used for things totally unrelated to what you're watching?
[09:55:31] <wer0ckz> help please. http://pastebin.com/E4AdPNw9 - the "$(this).attr('data-name')" is Undefined. im using a context menu plugin: http://plugins.jquery.com/ui-contextmenu/
[09:55:45] <wer0ckz> i wonder if i can use the $(this).attr('data-name')
[09:56:58] <wer0ckz> my list  is <li data-name="test"> a generated element
[09:57:11] <shoky> wer0ckz: "this" only changes in a function call, not in an object literal like you're passing here
[09:57:20] <shoky> so it's probably not what you think it is
[09:58:14] <wer0ckz> how can i correct it? please advice. thanks
[10:02:00] <wer0ckz> shoky: is it possible to use the ui.target to display as text?
[10:05:11] <shoky> wer0ckz: i suppose you can bind to the "beforeOpen" event and modify the entry each time
[10:05:35] <shoky> there's a setEntry method
[10:09:43] <wer0ckz> "beforeOpen" event? where is it located? can i PM?
[10:10:14] <shoky> it's located in the docs  https://github.com/mar10/jquery-ui-contextmenu/blob/master/README.md
[10:10:20] <shoky> no reason to PM
[10:10:40] <wer0ckz> ok checking
[10:10:41] <wer0ckz> thank you
[10:12:50] <shoky> wer0ckz: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/uyJ75/
[10:14:15] <wer0ckz> checking. thank you
[10:17:09] <wer0ckz> shoky: thank you so much it works
[10:19:46] <prometh> NoiseEee: because i need to support browsers that do not support transition events
[10:20:00] <prometh> on() won't do that on its own.. so i need to extend on()
[10:23:15] <Tomashe> anyone got some good tutorial for ajax uploading file
[10:34:13] <NoiseEee> prometh: no, you need to use something like modernizr which figures that stuff out for you.  if body.hasClass('transitions') { //do shit }
[10:35:46] <prometh> sure, but that still needs to function insdie on()
[10:35:55] <prometh> i want my plugin to be initiated through on()... no other api
[10:36:20] <prometh> modernizr is irrelevant because that's used to detect whether transitions are supported or not... which would be inside the on()
[10:36:42] <prometh> and i can detect such without modernizr... just gotta look for transition css styles
[10:36:58] <NoiseEee> prometh: sigh. good luck.
[10:37:06] <prometh> support for old browsers should be invisible in my app and handled within my plugin
[10:37:15] <prometh> i've already solved it... it's almost written
[10:37:16] <NoiseEee> prometh: it should be in the CALLBACK that .on() references.
[10:37:28] <prometh> no, cuz in old browsers that callback will not be called.
[10:37:38] <prometh> without extending on()
[10:37:42] <NoiseEee> great, i'm sure it plays really well with other things using 'on()'.   best of luck
[10:37:47] <prometh> it does
[10:38:00] <prometh> it's not that difficult, you know
[10:51:41] <Mafiay2k> I have some problems with the http://www.tn3gallery.com/ with ipad images does  not center in fullpage  anyone does know how to fix it?
[10:55:44] <enape_101>  hey, not sure if i'm targetting the breadrumbs a(links) correctly please see the line of jquery is it .nav.breadcrumbs > li > a? doesn't work
[10:55:52] <enape_101>  https://gist.github.com/naushadparpia/bd0ce3f87d8277dd0e50
[11:02:57] <enape_101> i guess the question is how to target the breadcrumbs link with css correctly? thanks in advanced
[11:02:58] <enape_101> https://gist.github.com/naushadparpia/bd0ce3f87d8277dd0e50 the way I've done isn't working.
[11:07:21] <tra> enape_101: your selector is wrong, i think it should be .breadcrumb li a
[11:12:49] <enape_101> thanks tra, let me try that
[11:15:17] <enape_101> that sort of works but now it doesn't actually link to the page?
[11:23:55] <enape_101> it looks like the class isn't sticing
[11:23:59] <enape_101> sticking*
[11:24:05] <enape_101> only when I click, and when I release it's gone
[11:24:54] <enape_101> https://gist.github.com/naushadparpia/bd0ce3f87d8277dd0e50
[11:25:17] <enape_101> the active class isn't sticking, it disappears when I release the click.
[11:26:57] <NoiseEee> isn't that the definition of a:active?
[11:27:58] <enape_101> that might very well be the problem, I'd like it to work as such.. when I'm on the homepage the active is attached until I switch to another page in which it is attached to that page link
[11:28:05] <enape_101> so if i'm on home, home link should be bold etc...
[11:29:03] <NoiseEee> so create the class ".active" on the appropriate elements?
[11:29:10] <NoiseEee> haven't been following, sorry, but isnt this straight ahead?
[11:30:27] <enape_101> thanks NoiseEee, it does seem straight forward but it's not working. here's the code wht am I doing wrong? https://gist.github.com/naushadparpia/bd0ce3f87d8277dd0e50
[11:33:17] <NoiseEee>  enape_101: .breadcrumb li a.active {    color: #999999;} / $('.breadcrumb li a.active')   don't use the pseudo :active, say "i'm on this page, and this link is officially taking the .active class"
[11:34:40] <enape_101> thanks so much NoiseEee
[11:34:46] <enape_101> let me try
[11:35:20] <enape_101> wtf, it's still not adding the active class to the links?
[11:35:23] <enape_101> i'll update the gist
[11:36:21] <enape_101> NoiseEee https://gist.github.com/naushadparpia/bd0ce3f87d8277dd0e50
[11:37:35] <NoiseEee> enape_101: you are responsible for putting the class on the appropriate <a> tag in your nav.
[11:41:35] <enape_101> NoiseEee, right, I thought this jQuery code was supposed to add the class on the clicked <a> ?
[11:42:32] <NoiseEee> enape_101: then you want your selector to be $('.breadcrumb li a') and you also definitely want to brush up on your javascript/jquery. good luck.
[11:43:07] <enape_101> fair enough
[12:19:14] <sekyms> anyone know off the top of their head the largest two digit decimal number that can be stored in a real?
[12:26:43] <Suppa|Lap> hello
[12:27:21] <Suppa|Lap> why even if I load the latest jQuery (1.x) and I check the jQuery variable in the chrome console I get undefined?
[12:29:02] <sekyms> put your code in a jsfiddle
[12:29:14] <sekyms> so we can seee what you are doing
[12:30:31] <Suppa|Lap> sekyms: I'm not sure I can put this on a jsfiddle, but I can give you the url?
[12:30:41] <sekyms> yes
[12:31:07] <Suppa|Lap> that's the url, jquery is being loaded at the very bottom
[12:31:13] <sekyms> next time put it in the channel so everyone can help you
[12:32:16] <Suppa|Lap> I don't want the url to be in a public channel, or even logged :/
[12:33:24] <sekyms> i dont see where you are trying to load it
[12:34:22] <Suppa|Lap> it's at the very bottom, you can ctrl + f "1.10.2" and you'll find it
[12:36:32] <sekyms> not found
[12:36:37] <Suppa|Lap> ummh
[12:36:39] <sekyms> you sure your local version is live?
[12:37:16] <Suppa|Lap> yes
[12:38:15] <Suppa|Lap> oh wait
[12:38:33] <Suppa|Lap> server was serving an old cached version for non logged users
[12:38:41] <Suppa|Lap> let me refresh it
[12:59:50] <majuscule> Is there any way to do something like super.super.myfunction()? I'm overriding a function that is overriding a function, and I'd like to skip the parent, but call the grandparent before executing my code there
[13:00:46] <Weezey> For
[13:02:25] <Weezey> I have a table with possibly multiple rows, and I have other stuff on the page that possibly has the same name, so how do I pick the first #companyID in .companyrow
[13:02:48] <majuscule> whoops! my question was in the wrong channel :-) forgive me
[13:03:07] <Weezey> $(".companyrow").find("#companyID").first()  ?
[13:04:44] <NoiseEee> Weezey: but there can only ever be a single instance of an id
[13:04:59] <Weezey> the row gets cloned
[13:05:03] <Weezey> so there are many
[13:05:17] <NoiseEee> well then you had better change the ID of the cloned rows.
[13:05:31] <NoiseEee> because thats not valid / your JS will be alllllll goofy
[13:05:54] <Weezey> ok, so $(".companyrow").find(".companyID").first()  ?
[13:06:15] <NoiseEee> assuming you've changed the ID to the class '.companyID', sure
[13:06:23] <Weezey> perfect
[13:06:23] <Weezey> thanks
[13:07:04] <Weezey> oh, check that out, I did fix this before, it is a class name not id
[13:17:04] <Weezey> Does an element need to be visible to access it with jquery?
[13:19:39] <NoiseEee> no but it needs to be in the DOM
[13:29:38] <nettoweb> guys, Im trying to do a .live(submit... in a form, an then I try to get .serialize but ie wont work just in IE. I take a look at many topics on stackoverflow, but these didnt worked for me... c
[13:30:22] <duch_kazatel> nettoweb have a jsfiddle example?
[13:31:27] <nettoweb> https://gist.github.com/osnysantos/ddd5cbb1996e66fa4e6d
[13:32:06] <nettoweb> duch_kazatel:
[13:32:28] <duch_kazatel> nettoweb which version of jQuery are you using?
[13:33:05] <nettoweb> duch_kazatel: I was reading this: http://fluid7.co.uk/blog/2011/07/08/jquery-livesubmit-and-form-serialize-issues-in-ie/ but also didnt worked
[13:33:22] <duch_kazatel> nettoweb which version of jquery are you using?
[13:33:33] <cluelesscoder> hi, I'm using jquery (.getJSON) to load some options in a select box from a database - but I can't seem to be able to operate on the options, even when I use suggestions such as using window.load (per http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3008696/after-all-document-ready-have-run-is-there-and-event-for-that) and (window).bind per http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/run-javascript-only-after-entire-
[13:33:35] <cluelesscoder> page-has-loaded/
[13:33:38] <nettoweb> duch_kazatel: 1.8.3
[13:33:55] <cluelesscoder> however, if I use the console I can operate on them, of course...
[13:34:06] <duch_kazatel> nettoweb you should be using http://api.jquery.com/on/ instead of .live() in that case.
[13:36:47] <nettoweb> duch_kazatel why?
[13:37:37] <duch_kazatel> nettoweb because .live() is deprecated.
[13:37:46] <nettoweb> duch_kazatel: I tried but didnt work... my form is loaded via ajax inside a bootstrap modal... when I submit th page reload
[13:38:32] <duch_kazatel> nettoweb it's more than just swapping out the word "live" for the word "on" ;)
[13:39:15] <nettoweb> duch_kazatel: right, I'm tweaking
[13:40:22] <duch_kazatel> nettoweb huh?  do you know how events work in JS?
[13:41:01] <nettoweb> duch_kazatel: not exactly, Im new with js
[13:41:33] <duch_kazatel> nettoweb you'll want to go learn about events .on()
[13:41:40] <duch_kazatel> *err and the .on() method
[13:42:48] <nettoweb> is not simply change to: $("form").on("submit", "#form-lead", function() {
[13:42:49] <nettoweb> ?
[13:46:33] <NoiseEee> nettoweb: sure, that would call the function when the form with the id "form-lead" was submitted.
[13:46:47] <NoiseEee> nettoweb: don't forget to stop the event, though.
[13:47:51] <nettoweb> NoiseEee: ok, but seems it still wasnt working
[13:50:48] <NoiseEee> nettoweb: $("form").on("submit", "#form-lead", function(e) { alert('i need to learn how to debug!'); })
[13:53:17] <nettoweb> NoiseEee: yep
[13:57:59] <nettoweb> I was facing this exacly problem described here: http://fluid7.co.uk/blog/2011/07/08/jquery-livesubmit-and-form-serialize-issues-in-ie/ now I change to .on but I cant get serialized in IE... can someone already faced this problem before?
[14:03:55] <NoiseEee> nettoweb: its because you're not stopping the event i bet.  see how they did that on line 3?
[14:04:05] <NoiseEee> nettoweb: .serialize() works juuuust fine in IE
[14:04:33] <NoiseEee> so your function is being called, but the form gets submitted normally / non-XHR because you haven't stopped the default event of 'submitting'
[14:04:57] <nettoweb> NoiseEee: I'm stopping..but when I try to console.log it stay blank, did you saw that link I sent you before? its a related problem
[14:05:10] <thebope> hi, I am using datatables and would like to sort an OL elements LI items within the table
[14:05:17] <thebope> using the filter provided
[14:05:34] <thebope> I've been looking at fnfilter for a bit but am not sure exactly how to go about it
[14:05:35] <NoiseEee> nettoweb: i suggest you try to recreate the problem on a jsfiddle.
[14:06:01] <nettoweb> NoiseEee: right
[14:07:45] <Keizer> Hey guys, I have some data that was iterated by a Kendo template that I am trying to select in DOM but when I attempt to select the rendered data it doesn't find any

[14:28:26] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[14:28:31] <Starcraftmazter> i'd like to run something in the future
[14:28:33] <Starcraftmazter> how do i do this
[14:28:44] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: How far into the future?
[14:29:22] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: You probably just want setTimeout(). I don't know why I'm thinking you want something to run in a few years.
[14:29:29] <Starcraftmazter> 500 ms
[14:29:33] <Starcraftmazter> haha
[14:29:38] <Starcraftmazter> i figured i'd use setTimeout
[14:29:45] <Starcraftmazter> does jquery have any nice wrapper for it?
[14:30:07] <Starcraftmazter> and how do i make execute only once
[14:30:11] <Starcraftmazter> or rather
[14:30:15] <BillCriswell> It has delay for animations and stuff, but setTimeout() should do fine.
[14:30:21] <BillCriswell> setTimeout will only run once.
[14:30:25] <Starcraftmazter> oh ok
[14:30:26] <BillCriswell> You might be thinking of setInterval()
[14:30:28] <Starcraftmazter> cool
[14:30:32] <Starcraftmazter> i probably am, yes
[14:31:47] <BillCriswell> I think I need a nap.
[14:34:49] <Starcraftmazter> thanks BillCriswell
[14:37:20] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[14:41:25] <petey> How would I go about setting the width of an object? I'm looking at .css('width', window.outerWIdth) but I'm not sure that is right.
[14:41:47] <petey> $('.slide').css('width', window.outerWidth);
[14:41:56] <snover> + 'px'
[14:42:36] <petey> inside the .css()?
[14:43:26] <petey> yay! thanks snover.
[14:52:51] <unstable> There are a bunch of ways to set an input value to a variable, what is the recommended best practice?
[14:54:35] <duch_kazatel> unstable depends on the case.
[14:54:45] <duch_kazatel> unstable do you have a specific example?
[14:55:35] <unstable> duch_kazatel: I just have some simple form, and on button click I do some stuff.
[14:57:02] <duch_kazatel> imo the answer changed depending on the use case.
[14:57:25] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to ship it off to a server, serialize the whole thing and send it off.
[14:57:40] <unstable> It's not going to hit the network
[14:57:46] <unstable> It's just changing an attribute in an SVG
[14:58:06] <unstable> So a value will be fed into a function
[14:58:19] <duch_kazatel> var yourVar = $(this).find('input#anId');
[14:58:33] <duch_kazatel> var yourVar = $(this).find('input#anId').val(), actually;
[15:12:45] <nettoweb> guys, I already fix some error in my ajax call, but my problem is still occuring: only in IE my form cant get serialized, https://gist.github.com/osnysantos/83e918b31746ebac2d7f
[15:13:10] <nettoweb> some told me that live is deprecated but it still works on chrome/fx, but cant work well in IE
[15:44:07] <zDog> when i use clone() and try to append it gives me object Object
[16:28:52] <prometh> where is the best place to store plugin variables? data() seems too exposed
[16:30:05] <cluelesscoder> I really don't understand how jquery adds content dynamically
[16:30:20] <cluelesscoder> seems to be a lot of confusion from other people too
[16:31:38] <prometh> instance variables
[16:31:45] <prometh> anyone have the answer?
[16:33:20] <coldhead> prometh: people commonly use closures to store variables "privately"
[16:33:32] <prometh> what does that look like?
[16:33:35] <coldhead> look for the section on scope in http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[16:33:39] <coldhead> they have examples
[16:33:39] <prometh> i'm not talking about global vars for the entire plugin
[16:33:43] <prometh> i mean instance vars
[16:34:01] <coldhead> oh
[16:34:18] <coldhead> well you could still use closures but i guess they don't have examples there
[16:34:24] <prometh> i have a closure in already
[16:34:33] <prometh> with vars global to all instances of the plugin
[16:34:38] <prometh> but what about instance vars? use data() ?
[16:34:47] <prometh> i need to store setTimeout instances
[16:35:05] <prometh> data isn't private enough
[16:35:09] <coldhead> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/what-s-the-right-way-to-store-private-data-in-widget-s-instance
[16:35:16] <prometh> yeah i saw that
[16:35:19] <prometh> htey use "this"
[16:35:20] <coldhead> they recommend using this._options
[16:35:21] <coldhead> right
[16:35:22] <prometh> i'm not sure where to put that
[16:35:37] <prometh> i have a closure, then $.fn.function = function()
[16:35:39] <coldhead> that's attaching them to the dom element you're invoking the plugin on
[16:35:42] <tw2113> know anything yet coldhead ?
[16:35:52] <coldhead> less than ever, tw2113
[16:36:05] <coldhead> help prometh, he deserves better than me
[16:36:05] <tw2113> attaboy
[16:36:15] <tw2113> you expect me to know stuff?
[16:36:52] <prometh> coldhead: but in what block do i use "this" ?
[16:37:04] <prometh> within the $.fn.function ?
[16:37:10] <prometh> this.timeout = ?
[16:37:12] <prometh> or $(this).timeout = ?
[16:37:45] <coldhead> i'm sorry, i have overreached my expertise
[16:37:50] <coldhead> i should never have said anything
[16:37:53] <prometh> ok, thank you just the same
[16:37:54] <prometh> hmm
[16:45:37] <coldhead> i'm disappointed tw2113 wasn't more help
[16:46:30] <tw2113> so am i
[16:46:37] <tw2113> freeloading a-hole
[19:24:52] <Forbidd3n> Is there a specific value size that can be sent as a argument through AJAX
[19:29:08] <Smerffy> I am new to jquery and having issues implementing some code, found here http://jsfiddle.net/ebXCr/4/   I've copied this down a few different times, but can't get it to run.
[19:38:02] <quarters> hi
[19:38:16] <quarters> for some reason, jsfiddle is not running the code for my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dPBML/1/
[19:38:24] <quarters> or I'm not seeing it in the result frame
[19:41:51] <bsegovia> Hi all
[20:01:47] <alpha232> blah
[20:08:37] <vinex08> guys i cant seem to find a tutorial or demo of the parallax effect of this one.. http://acumen.org/ ( Footer Image ) ..
[20:16:31] <BillCriswell> vinex08: http://ianlunn.co.uk/plugins/jquery-parallax/ might be useful?
[20:41:24] <adek> I do $('class1') and it returns me a list, now for each of the class1 I would like to select all divs which are in the tree rooted in current element, how can I do that?
[20:43:18] <grafi> which are what?
[20:45:04] <adek> grafi: Which are of class 2
[20:46:34] <adek> Basically my question is if I can tell jquery to start querying DOM starting from particular tag.
[20:47:40] <adek> I want to do query like $('.class1 .class2') but be able to have list of lists of elements, where each sublist is a list of class2 elements which are children of first class1 element in the DOM
[20:53:36] <grafi> still sounds confusing to me, sorry
[20:54:49] <adek> grafi: <html> <div class="class1"> <div class="class2"></div> </div> <div class="class1"><div class="class2"></div></div></html>
[20:55:28] <adek> I want result like this: [[<div class="class2">],[<div class=class2>]]
[20:55:43] <adek> Elements of class2 are grouped by their parent of class1
[20:59:30] <adek> grafi: Okay, I made it. $('.class1').each(function($elem) { $($elem).find('.class2'); })
[20:59:58] <grafi> hm yeah
[21:00:05] <grafi> interesting use case
[21:00:31] <adek> I am parsing a bunch of tables to put them into DB =)
[21:05:07] <grafi> ^^
[21:05:44] <grafi> still interesting, wouldnt you just go row by row for this?
[21:08:56] <Feel> Hello. How to highlight last div with class="my_class", if number of all div blocks in unknown? (With help of JS) http://codepen.io/Feel_codepen/pen/zrelL
[21:11:15] <adek> grafi: Now, it's a classes plan and there are some boxes which are empty, some of them are not, so it's easier to jest take everything which is not empty and take content out of interesting nodes.
[21:12:45] <adek> Feel: $('.my_class').last() doesn't work?
[22:31:19] <hifive111> please tell me soem nice image slider
[22:47:23] <lemonsparrow> http://pastebin.com/TVvCwq1R page-lst is the class name of the page that I am currently passing to controller  for. fetching block-lst. We can select multiple or single element in  page-lst using cntrl or shift+arrow keys. The question is how we will deselect the thing.Also need to seperate single or multiple select.
[22:48:01] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hello
[22:58:55] <amh345> I'm trying to highlight a button in a nav bar if an element on the page is within 100px from the top of the window.   i found something like this.   if ( $(window).scrollTop() > $("#some_elem ).offset().top  but this constantly triggers while the element is below "top".  is there some sort of "within" method i can use?
[23:03:59] <zhulikas> check for lower bound as well
[23:05:08] <Tomashe> Hey guys , i got some serious issue with my browser cache or the js is messed up, can someone have a look?
[23:06:53] <amh345> zhulikas: was that for me?
[23:07:02] <zhulikas> yeah
[23:07:30] <zhulikas> you should check for something like if (a < b && a > c)
[23:07:41] <amh345> hmm
[23:07:50] <zhulikas> right now you check only for one of those
[23:08:01] <zhulikas> not sure which one, no idea what are the numbers in those variables of yours ;)
[23:08:51] <amh345> I'm use trying to check when an element is 100px from top top of the window.
[23:09:03] <amh345> so i can highlight it in the nav bar.
[23:09:38] <amh345> but everything I'm finding is for if it's viewable in window. which doesn't really work since there could be a couple of elements in window at a time.
[23:09:57] <lemonsparrow> Hi can anyone tell me as to why this fiddle isnt working.. http://jsfiddle.net/peBZe/6/ I want the item selected to be added into an array and displayed

[23:12:34] <lemonsparrow> Hi can anyone tell me as to why this fiddle isnt working.. http://jsfiddle.net/peBZe/6/ I want the item selected to be added into an array and displayed
[23:13:17] <grafi> no
[23:14:31] <lemonsparrow> grafi: pls help me out.. i am new to jquery

[23:21:08] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/peBZe/8/

[23:21:40] <duckgoose> wee
[23:22:03] <lemonsparrow> ?
[23:22:30] <duckgoose> weird ascii character
[23:24:17] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ya alert() doesn't alert anything cause list i undefined
[23:26:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: why ?
[23:27:06] <Cork> check what variable names your using
[23:27:24] <lemonsparrow> Cork: oops :)
[23:27:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/peBZe/9/ ok
[23:27:30] <lemonsparrow> Cork: its working fine now
[23:27:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork: now the only thing is at any given time I should have in the array only selected values..
[23:28:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: and the thing is I can deselect/unselect using mouse click CTRL and SHIFT
[23:28:17] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how to handle all the cases ?
[23:28:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: mouseup kinda covers some scenarios but it's not fool proof
[23:29:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: and now on selecting a value and deselecting and again selecting it gives me something like CHN,MUM, CHN
[23:29:54] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I just want the value only once in the array
[23:30:23] <amh345> i think i got this element x from top sorted out.
[23:31:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: you there ?
[23:33:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/peBZe/10/
[23:34:15] <lemonsparrow> Cork: awesome
[23:34:31] <amh345> lemonsparrow: it looks like theres a filter method availabl.
[23:34:36] <amh345> oh. it's been answered.
[23:34:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can u explain         selectedList = $.map(             $(this).find('option')                    .filter(function() {                        return this.selected                    }),             function(elm) {                                 return elm.value;             });
[23:35:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i moved the click handler to the select element
[23:35:22] <Cork> and on each time you click it it grabs all options inside it
[23:35:31] <Cork> loop over them and check if the element is selected
[23:35:37] <Cork> and then collect it all in an array
[23:36:25] <Cork> so not sure if you need selectedList to be scoped like you do
[23:36:29] <Cork> might work with local
[23:36:37] <Cork> depends on what you plan to do with it
[23:37:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/peBZe/12/ how about this ?
[23:37:35] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it's just a different syntax for the same thing
[23:37:52] <Cork> i meant you might be able to move selectedList into the change handler
[23:38:02] <Cork> oh, right sorry you changed event
[23:38:05] <Cork> ya, that should work
[23:38:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the use case is every time user select a value another listbox opens corresponding to that value using ajax ... so if user selects two list box at a time two sub list box should appear.. now when he deselects one that list box alone should be removed
[23:38:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i meant you might not need to collect the value on change
[23:39:38] <Cork> lemonsparrow: also note live is deprecated
[23:40:01] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://pastebin.com/FU7nCkDe
[23:40:02] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so i would recommend using delegate instead
[23:40:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the above method would give u an idea
[23:41:53] <Cork> lemonsparrow: also your causing a LOT of reflows in the page
[23:42:03] <Cork> you don't want to append in a loop to an element in the dom
[23:43:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[23:43:07] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how would the code look like then ?
[23:43:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: use an array
[23:43:20] <Cork> push the new strings to the array
[23:43:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the best possible solution.. if you could modify my code
[23:43:31] <Cork> and then .join('') the array in an append after the loop
[23:44:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[23:58:31] <amh345> is there a way i can make this a bit cleaner?  i'd like to not have multiple functions doing basically the same thing. http://pastebin.com/4WQQ3nqN
[23:59:14] <amh345> what this does is trigger if a div is x amount of pixels from the top of the page, but not more less than 100
[23:59:19] <Cork> amh345: use a class for the target elements
[23:59:29] <Cork> and use a for loop instead of separate event handlers
[23:59:50] <amh345> i tried that initial. i was going to use a class than get that divs id and work from there. but a class is always detecting.
