[00:00:07] <Eviltwin> Rather than the real features
[00:00:16] <Eviltwin> No wonder you like C#
[00:00:36] <systemfault> Hmm... C# has a lot of nice features.. btw
[00:00:42] <Eviltwin> Like?
[00:00:59] <systemfault> Oh shit :/
[00:01:10] <DEADB33F> I do kinda like python's semantics
[00:01:16] <DEADB33F> it's a very clean language
[00:01:29] <systemfault> I think I'll just avoid answering..
[00:01:52] <theBrettman> just say namespaces, lol
[00:01:52] <Eviltwin> systemfault: Good defense of a language with "lots of nice features"
[00:01:56] <Eviltwin> Not being able to name one :P
[00:02:11] <theBrettman> just like actionscript
[00:02:19] <theBrettman> javascript's cousin
[00:02:23] <systemfault> Eviltwin: Well, I'll defend it more when MS is going to pay me to do it.
[00:02:37] <Eviltwin> JavaScript's inbred cousin from the south
[00:02:44] <theBrettman> if javascript and actionscript had an incest baby, what would it look like?
[00:03:01] <systemfault> actionscript? :/
[00:03:15] <theBrettman> actionscript the 3rd, lol
[00:03:23] <systemfault> actionscript jr.
[00:04:16] <theBrettman> so any of u know about this decycle and retrocycle stuffs? cuz google's not spillin the beans
[00:05:05] <theBrettman> I have a feeling it's some db related stuff
[00:05:33] <theBrettman> oh, I see what decycle is for
[00:05:42] <theBrettman> that's for bad code, lol
[00:05:58] <theBrettman> bad, decycle is bad
[00:06:50] <theBrettman> can I cyclic reference be good in anyway?
[00:07:26] <theBrettman> *a
[00:09:33] <theBrettman> ha, no one wants to touch that subject
[00:15:09] <killer11> coudl someone tell me why this isnt working?
[00:15:10] <killer11> http://jsfiddle.net/GcxXV/
[00:15:25] <killer11> the ajax isnt being sent when eaither of the buttons is being pressed
[00:17:08] <theBrettman> y u call preventDefault() first?
[00:17:26] <theBrettman> call it before the return
[00:17:52] <killer11> well button doesnt do anything anyway so i coudl comment it out
[00:18:04] <killer11> but it still doesnt work even if i do
[00:19:52] <theBrettman> where's it getting serial.php?
[00:20:04] <killer11> its in the root directory
[00:20:18] <theBrettman> of the fiddle?
[00:20:25] <theBrettman> ohwell, u should still get error
[00:20:48] <killer11> of the web server
[00:20:58] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: Uh... he has syntax errors
[00:21:05] <Eviltwin> One step at a time, theBrettman
[00:21:21] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ killer11
[00:21:22] <bot-t> killer11, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[00:21:58] <theBrettman> yeah, he doesn't need to use $(function(){}); is jsfiddle
[00:22:14] <theBrettman> oh wait, he put it in html
[00:22:15] <theBrettman> nvm
[00:22:25] <Eviltwin> ..
[00:22:25] <killer11> what?
[00:22:42] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: Do you know what a syntax error is?
[00:22:47] <theBrettman> yep
[00:22:49] <theBrettman> a comma
[00:22:59] <theBrettman> after alert(response)
[00:23:09] <theBrettman> should be a ; if anything
[00:23:16] <theBrettman> not required tho
[00:23:28] <killer11> i dont see any syntax errors
[00:23:33] <killer11> the , is not needed
[00:23:38] <killer11> and the ; is not needed
[00:23:42] <killer11> ebcause it is in a block
[00:23:48] <theBrettman> doesn't matter
[00:23:52] <Eviltwin> The , needs to not be there
[00:23:53] <theBrettman> that comma is killin ur code
[00:24:05] <killer11> on which line?
[00:24:18] <killer11> ahh
[00:24:25] <theBrettman> in the success
[00:24:29] <killer11> damn comma!!!
[00:24:34] <theBrettman> lol
[00:24:54] <theBrettman> I got bit by a comma yesterday
[00:24:57] <theBrettman> sneaky bastards

[00:30:04] <theBrettman> what's the led for?
[00:30:52] <theBrettman> oh shit
[00:30:54] <codepal> killer11: thanks for the site, awesome - in 5 mins I've started feeling like a jquery guru!
[00:31:03] <theBrettman> r we making it do that?
[00:31:21] <theBrettman> ha ha
[00:31:29] <theBrettman> big delay
[00:31:32] <killer11> yupp
[00:31:36] <theBrettman> lag a lag
[00:31:43] <theBrettman> that is sweet!
[00:31:49] <killer11> i have used jquery for years
[00:31:50] <theBrettman> how do I learn to make drivers?
[00:31:52] <killer11> codepal
[00:31:57] <killer11> but the comma was messing me up
[00:32:05] <killer11> bad deugging on my part
[00:32:16] <killer11> there is like a 3sec delay
[00:32:24] <theBrettman> check ur prop insp sometime, lol
[00:32:37] <theBrettman> is it usb or dare I say bluetooth?
[00:32:50] <theBrettman> bluetooth would pwn for that
[00:32:50] <codepal> crap, trying to do morse on that is hell
[00:33:07] <theBrettman> not happenin
[00:33:45] <theBrettman> is it com to usb or just straight com?
[00:34:26] <theBrettman> I got a cool usb->com cord I bout to fix my seagate drive
[00:34:34] <theBrettman> I bet I could have some fun with it
[00:34:50] <theBrettman> I wonder how hard it is to add bluetooth radio instead?
[00:35:03] <Marko_> Guys I want to do simple animation - After I click on button I want to move down -> http://jsfiddle.net/JXvG8/7/
[00:36:24] <Eviltwin> You want to move what down?
[00:37:11] <codepal> good question, the button maybe?
[00:37:45] <theBrettman> looks like he's moving the start div to me
[00:38:22] <theBrettman> click the btn to move start to finish?
[00:38:30] <Marko_> ? not sure if I use it right I mean I did not :D
[00:38:31] <bot-t> Marko_, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:38:32] <Marko_> I just found this code
[00:38:46] <theBrettman> or .on()
[00:39:11] <theBrettman> don't think that has to do with this tho?
[00:39:45] <theBrettman> I thought scrollTop was just for scrollbar
[00:39:52] <codepal> Marko_: http://jsfiddle.net/JXvG8/8/
[00:39:58] <theBrettman> but I guess it's just an effect
[00:40:06] <codepal> it's a start, at least you'll see it as it moves down :P
[00:41:21] <Marko_> codepal: dont see it :)
[00:41:44] <theBrettman> what does offset return?
[00:42:00] <theBrettman> can u get .top of offset()?
[00:42:37] <woodsae> hey everyone
[00:42:45] <woodsae> i have a quick question
[00:42:51] <woodsae> if i do something like this: var $deleteInput = $(this).parent().next('li').find('input');
[00:43:01] <woodsae> and it finds the correct input
[00:43:03] <Cork> theBrettman: yes you can, you might want to use .position() though
[00:43:26] <woodsae> then why is it not working when i do: $deleteInput.val('30');
[00:43:34] <theBrettman> ha, tell him, not me, lol
[00:44:05] <theBrettman> I don't think it will work that way tho
[00:44:14] <Cork> woodsae: it should, as long as it really finds the correct element
[00:44:20] <Marko_> Cork: , theBrettman this part of code worked somewhere else but not in my case
[00:45:09] <Cork> Marko_: scrollTop gives how many pixels the scrillbar has been moved down
[00:45:09] <theBrettman> did u try a breakpoint in ur inspector yet?
[00:45:21] <woodsae> Cork: it seems to be finding the right element, cause when i alert the attr('id') it's the right one
[00:45:21] <Cork> so unless thats what you want to know, its the wrong value
[00:45:43] <Cork> woodsae: have you checked so the id doesn't exist multible times in the page?
[00:45:53] <Cork> (its a common mistake)
[00:46:20] <Marko_> Cork: not sure what do you mean, 500 means that I want to scrool up by 500?
[00:46:31] <woodsae> Cork: yep, it's the only one with that id
[00:46:35] <theBrettman> you can't scroll up, ur up
[00:47:02] <Marko_> ?
[00:47:05] <Cork> woodsae: try $('[id="<your id>"]').length
[00:47:17] <theBrettman> what would you do if I told you to go to where you are standing?
[00:47:24] <Cork> Marko_: guess i have to backup, didn't catch the beginning of the question
[00:47:27] <theBrettman> how far would you move?
[00:47:40] <Cork> Marko_: yes scrollTop will be 0 if the scrollbar is at the top
[00:47:49] <Marko_> ok i get this but tell me what does it mean directly to my problem.
[00:47:56] <Marko_> ok so if I want to move somwhere down ...?
[00:48:03] <theBrettman> you're asking it to go nowhere
[00:48:28] <Cork> Marko_: window.scrollTop = $(this).offset().top; // Position the window at this elements top
[00:48:30] <theBrettman> you're looking at this the wrong way I think...
[00:48:40] <Marko_> I agree
[00:48:53] <theBrettman> don't use scrollTop
[00:49:45] <Marko_> theBrettman: Why not? what should I use instead?
[00:49:50] <theBrettman> make it change it's position to the other position
[00:49:58] <theBrettman> and get a circular reference, lol
[00:50:06] <killer11> im back
[00:50:11] <theBrettman> wait, that's not circular
[00:50:19] <raj> why can't I get http://68.44.194.145:8080/asdf/edit-profile?section=picture to look like http://www.persturesson.com/fileupload/
[00:50:28] <raj> It's really not making sense to me
[00:50:36] <Marko_> btw my actual goal is to add some new section and then move to it so lets say that someother text is section and I will add something new and I want user to see it
[00:50:45] <woodsae> Cork: when i do the try $('[id="<your id>"]').length it comes back with 1
[00:51:05] <Cork> ok
[00:51:06] <theBrettman> you gotta get finish position and set start position to finish position inside the effect
[00:51:11] <Eviltwin> woodsae: Don't use the same ID more than once
[00:51:28] <raj> oh, hi Cork  :)
[00:51:29] <theBrettman> easiest way would be to assign finish position to var
[00:51:29] <Cork> woodsae: and $deleteInput.length is 1 too?
[00:51:34] <Cork> raj: ello
[00:51:55] <raj> i forgot what I wanted to ask you ealier
[00:52:03] <Cork> XD
[00:52:09] <woodsae> Cork: yep
[00:52:40] <Cork> woodsae: then ya $deleteInput.val('30'); should work
[00:52:55] <Cork> check so the code really is called
[00:53:32] <woodsae> Cork: it doesn't for some reason, but .text('30') works
[00:53:42] <Cork> .text?
[00:53:50] <Cork> is it really an input?
[00:53:58] <theBrettman> Marko_, use a slider plugin? :D
[00:54:03] <Cork> text doesn't work if you want to add text to an input field
[00:54:56] <Cork> woodsae: it would really help if you could create a test case see ?p
[00:54:56] <bot-t> woodsae, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:55:39] <Marko_> theBrettman: heh little owerkill :)
[00:56:01] <woodsae> bot-t: i'll give it a try
[00:56:05] <bot-t> woodsae, #4016 ([IE 6 & 7] Errors when traversing child elements after ... - Opened 3 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4016
[00:56:16] <theBrettman> it's easier. hell, the jquery library is overkill, lol. u don't have to use everything in it but u still import it
[00:56:34] <theBrettman> but jquery cycle plugin is pretty lite
[00:57:30] <theBrettman> making it ajaxy is a lil hard tho
[00:57:52] <woodsae> bot-t: fixed it, i had to change the input type from text to hidden
[00:57:53] <bot-t> woodsae, .val() - Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[00:58:18] <Cork> woodsae: bot-t is just that a bot :)
[00:58:27] <woodsae> Cork: thanks for the help
[00:58:48] <Cork> woodsae: but type="text" or type="hidden" shouldn't affect val()
[00:58:55] <Cork> it has to be something else
[00:59:17] <theBrettman> you can thank a bot, it doesn't have feelings but it will talk to you, lol
[00:59:33] <woodsae> Cork: the input was inside of an li that had display:none if that makes any difference
[01:00:02] <Cork> woodsae: it will in ie, but not in other browsers
[01:00:39] <woodsae> Cork: hmmm....i'm a bit stumped on this one
[01:00:57] <Cork> it would really help if i could see the code :)
[01:01:07] <Cork> thats why i asked to see a testcase
[01:02:46] <woodsae> Cork: let me put it in that jsfiddle thing real quick
[01:06:23] <theBrettman> still there Mark0_?
[01:07:01] <theBrettman> oops, I mean Marko_
[01:07:54] <Marko_> Yes
[01:07:54] <woodsae> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/WqCJn/
[01:08:03] <Marko_> I am sorry I am working on somewhere else...
[01:08:07] <woodsae> Cork: i guess it was working, i just couldn't see the value getting set in the inspector
[01:08:16] <woodsae> Cork: my mistake
[01:08:30] <Cork> woodsae: ah, ya the attribute isn't always updated
[01:08:40] <theBrettman> are you trying to put start just above finish or layered above or below or?
[01:08:49] <Marko_> and reason I don't want to use it because code I showed you is more or less code use already in project on different place. So i thought little change of it will work
[01:08:51] <Cork> woodsae: been there, done that ;)
[01:09:02] <woodsae> Cork: thanks again for all the help
[01:09:46] <Cork> woodsae: np, you did most of the work :)
[01:10:11] <woodsae> Cork: i'm pretty new to IRC, but i'm loving this immediate assistance from peers
[01:11:36] <Cork> woodsae: ya, i do too, thats why i hang around it so much :)
[01:12:29] <woodsae> Cork: when i send a message like this does it appear with a grey background for you?
[01:12:50] <Cork> woodsae: no that depends on settings in the client
[01:13:41] <Cork> you can use so called "mirc colors" to set color on your text (if the channel allows it)
[01:14:14] <woodsae> so starting a message with the persons handle isn't a private direct message is it?
[01:14:40] <Cork> nope, thats just a prefix
[01:15:04] <woodsae> k
[01:15:06] <\mSg> in other words, I can see everything said between you two so far
[01:15:14] <woodsae> ok, makes sense
[01:15:18] <\mSg> if you /msg nickname message
[01:15:35] <\mSg> that's private, however it's usually impolite to do so without first asking the individual
[01:17:43] <\mSg> Another thing to consider is that by sending messages openly, it allows others to learn with you...even if they never speak up. - kind of like browsing forums to learn about a topic.
[01:18:18] <Cork> and thats why many don't accept to help in private messages
[01:19:02] <woodsae> ok cool
[01:19:09] <Cork> another problem with helping in private messages, is if the one helping needs to go, noone can take up where he left off
[01:19:19] <woodsae> wasn't sure cause in my client it was highlighting what Cork was sending me, so i thought it might have been private
[01:19:45] <\mSg> (or she) left off :p
[01:19:49] <Cork> woodsae: ya, its quite commit for clients to "hightlight" when the nick is used
[01:20:13] <Cork> \mSg: haven't you heard evenyone is a he on irc ;P
[01:20:20] <\mSg> I know haha
[01:20:36] <Cork> and every girl is an FBI agent ;)
[01:20:38] <youngin> good morning fellow young people!
[01:20:38] <\mSg> some clients even popup a message, or make noise on a highlight
[01:20:42] <youngin> Cork: lol
[01:20:51] <youngin> especially if she say her age is 12
[01:20:56] <\mSg> rawr, get off my lawn
[01:21:02] <Cork> youngin: exactly
[01:21:07] <Cork> i love that old joke :)
[01:21:25] <theBrettman> Marko_ the problem is you gotta set #start to absolute positioning or it can't move
[01:23:21] <theBrettman> Marko_ and change scrollTop to top and offset() to position()
[01:23:46] <Marko_> the can you please provide me example?
[01:23:47] <theBrettman> oh, offset works too
[01:24:07] <theBrettman> http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/JXvG8/10/
[01:24:43] <Cork> theBrettman: it depends if you want to referenc to the closest parent with potition: relative/absolute/fixed; or to the window
[01:24:52] <theBrettman> right
[01:24:55] <Cork> *reference
[01:25:12] <theBrettman> most likely, position is better but idk what he's doin so...
[01:25:15] <woodsae> side question: anyone listening to the Triple J Hottest 100?
[01:25:42] <theBrettman> but the problem was scrollTop and you can't move a static element
[01:27:35] <theBrettman> wanna see something cool? set that element to fixed and try it!
[01:27:42] <theBrettman> it works but then disappears!
[01:27:46] <theBrettman> where does it go?
[01:27:50] <theBrettman> no one knows!
[01:27:55] <theBrettman> into the great wide ether!
[01:28:53] <Cork> theBrettman: not for me
[01:29:05] <theBrettman> nvm
[01:29:09] <theBrettman> idk what that was
[01:29:21] <theBrettman> it was only when my properties inspector was open
[01:29:24] <theBrettman> I know y now
[01:29:40] <Cork> ah you mean when its clicked
[01:29:43] <theBrettman> it was still at the location but I couldn't get to the location to see
[01:30:10] <theBrettman> I scrolled the page up but that doesn't change where it is. it was hiding behind my inspector
[01:30:37] <theBrettman> try it! it's fun
[01:30:38] <theBrettman> lol
[01:30:39] <Cork> theBrettman: it fails quite splendedly if your window height is smaller then the range is should move :)
[01:30:46] <theBrettman> yep
[01:30:51] <theBrettman> it's there but you can't see it
[01:30:56] <theBrettman> cuz it's off your view
[01:31:11] <Cork> or me it ends up cs 200-300 px below the page
[01:31:19] <Cork> (below the end of the page)
[01:31:36] <theBrettman> depends how far your inspector is open, lol
[01:31:42] <Cork> ya
[01:32:08] <theBrettman> ha, I dragged my inspector down so I could see it
[01:32:29] <theBrettman> had to drag it down all the way
[01:33:03] <theBrettman> well I did my community service for today, lol
[01:33:03] <theBrettman> now I'd better get something done
[01:35:12] <theBrettman> I got underpants, I'm just not sure what to do at phase 2?
[01:36:06] <theBrettman> phase 2: process underpants
[01:36:11] <theBrettman> phase 3: profit!
[01:36:35] <theBrettman> or even better...
[01:36:43] <theBrettman> phase 1: get underpants
[01:36:50] <theBrettman> phase 2: set underpants
[01:36:56] <theBrettman> phase 3: profit!
[01:37:10] <theBrettman> roflmao
[01:38:35] <adac> hi guys! How can i start this additionally automatically on 'pageload'? http://pastebin.com/4BiGV8JC
[01:39:44] <Cork> adac: yes
[01:40:14] <theBrettman> just wrap it in (function($){...}(jQuery)); where the dots are
[01:40:21] <Cork> $(document).load(function() { $('#ontoevo-version-one').change(); });
[01:40:28] <Cork> adac: ^
[01:40:45] <theBrettman> mine is less typing
[01:40:56] <Cork> you doesn't do that same thing :)
[01:41:46] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/31/ - why won't #main-menu animate in when one hovers that big orange field?
[01:41:47] <Cork> adac: alternativly if you want it to trigger before the page shows use $(function() {}); instead of .load
[01:42:08] <adac> Cork, the theBrettman thank you guys!
[01:42:28] <theBrettman> np
[01:43:24] <adac> Cork,  I currently have wrappend all function with this: jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[01:43:30] <theBrettman> I would think if he's using delegate, he'd want the way I wrapped it
[01:43:44] <theBrettman> oh
[01:43:58] <theBrettman> well then you don't need that
[01:44:07] <theBrettman> I think he means the ajax load
[01:44:14] <theBrettman> this is the 2nd time today I did that
[01:44:40] <theBrettman> wait, no... he said pageload
[01:45:06] <theBrettman> so you don't wrap in .ready() what you want to happen during pageload
[01:45:26] <adac> theBrettman, wel I'm not really sure what .ready stands for. I need the page completely loaded which should be assured by .ready and then after that it should call the ajax stuff
[01:45:36] <adac> automagically :)
[01:45:37] <theBrettman> drop everything before (function($)
[01:45:55] <theBrettman> ready is after the page has finished loading
[01:46:07] <theBrettman> load is during loading
[01:46:29] <theBrettman> during loading is a good time to load ajax stuff
[01:46:30] <adac> so ready should call ajax right after the page has been fully loaded
[01:46:38] <theBrettman> yep
[01:46:43] <adac> ok let me try it with loading then
[01:46:45] <theBrettman> but why waste that time?
[01:46:47] <theBrettman> yep
[01:49:57] <adac> theBrettman, looks like with load the ajax is not called anymore
[01:50:57] <theBrettman> lies
[01:51:09] <theBrettman> asynchronus
[01:51:23] <theBrettman> it can do it during pageload
[01:53:50] <adac> theBrettman, I guess something else is fishy in my code
[01:53:50] <theBrettman> what's #ontoevo-version-one and what's making it change?
[01:54:34] <theBrettman> adac ^
[01:54:55] <adac> theBrettman, i can post it. and explain. wait a sec
[01:56:12] <theBrettman> use jsfiddle ?p
[01:57:00] <theBrettman> see ?p
[01:57:00] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:57:08] <theBrettman> that's how, lol
[01:57:25] <adac> theBrettman, yes I'm fiddeling already :D
[01:57:31] <theBrettman> k
[02:01:47] <theBrettman> killer11, what other language you use for that?
[02:02:01] <theBrettman> I know you can't access that light with javascript, lol
[02:02:10] <killer11> soon to be alot
[02:02:30] <killer11> sql,javascript,C,PHP,java and flash
[02:02:31] <theBrettman> I wanna make one. I got the stuff to do it too, lol
[02:02:45] <theBrettman> what you need the php and sql for?
[02:02:48] <theBrettman> and flash?
[02:02:58] <theBrettman> nvm, I  know what you need flash for
[02:03:04] <theBrettman> and maybe java for applet?
[02:03:05] <killer11> flash for stream
[02:03:12] <killer11> php for sending commands
[02:03:17] <killer11> c for the controller
[02:03:19] <muzone> This is probably a no-brainer to most of y'all, but how do I get the main menu in http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/35/to animate in when one hovers that big orange field?
[02:03:28] <killer11> java for the processing
[02:03:33] <killer11> sql for the database
[02:03:42] <muzone> * typo
[02:03:44] <theBrettman> why would u need c if ur using java?
[02:03:45] <muzone> This is probably a no-brainer to most of y'all, but how do I get the main menu at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/35/ animate in when one hovers that big orange field?
[02:04:50] <theBrettman> I think ur using animate wrong?
[02:05:00] <adac> theBrettman, http://jsfiddle.net/ruSBa/
[02:05:02] <muzone> I'm hoping I can hide the menu most of the time, to make my page easier on the eyes
[02:05:14] <muzone> theBrettman: I see. What you reckon I should do?
[02:05:17] <killer11> theBrettman: it has to use both for it to work
[02:05:51] <theBrettman> show me how to make controller with c?
[02:06:05] <theBrettman> I never learned how to make drivers
[02:06:14] <killer11> its not just programming
[02:06:23] <killer11> you have to know how to make circuits
[02:06:28] <g0th_> hi
[02:06:31] <killer11> and program chips
[02:07:17] <theBrettman> adac, you don't want the 2nd select to load on page load, just the first
[02:07:25] <theBrettman> load the other when you select something
[02:07:30] <youngin> muzone: looks like he gave you the cold shoulder lol
[02:07:35] <theBrettman> oh wait, I see why ur doing it
[02:07:45] <theBrettman> let me think
[02:07:59] <theBrettman> I know the circuit part
[02:08:12] <theBrettman> idk the programming part for usb
[02:08:15] <aloiscochard> yo peeps
[02:08:23] <adac> theBrettman,yes onload it gets me back all repos into the selsectbox. after that it should get all versions of this repo immediately automatically
[02:08:25] <theBrettman> ig I could look it up
[02:08:35] <theBrettman> yeah, u did it so it loads that one
[02:08:40] <aloiscochard> any one can give me info about how to do templating with jQuery ... the jQuery template project looks abandonned: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/ ??
[02:08:41] <theBrettman> it's just not changing on change
[02:08:50] <nFFF> Guys in some javascript that post's form data I have this: parameters: $('product_addtocart_form').serialize(true), -> what might product_addtocart_form be a selector of?
[02:09:02] <theBrettman> it's not aloiscochard
[02:09:05] <adac> theBrettman, exactyl also on load!
[02:09:26] <theBrettman> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl
[02:09:43] <aloiscochard> theBrettman: what make you think so? on github projec t page it's written "BETA. NO LONGER IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT OR MAINTENANCE" ?
[02:10:24] <aloiscochard> theBrettman: are you using it in production?
[02:10:59] <aloiscochard> ohhh it looks it's part of jQuery UI (from README on github)
[02:11:29] <aloiscochard> well.... status "in planning"
[02:11:42] <aloiscochard> :-(
[02:12:14] <aloiscochard> fyi: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/37898666/Template
[02:13:27] <theBrettman> no, not using it atm. maybe it's deprecated but it still works
[02:13:45] <theBrettman> adac, u got syntax error
[02:14:03] <theBrettman> just a sec muzone
[02:15:58] <theBrettman> muzone, what is hoverIntent?
[02:16:21] <aloiscochard> anyone using 'mustache' ?
[02:17:31] <theBrettman> adac, missing : after show()
[02:17:39] <theBrettman> oops, missing ;
[02:19:25] <adac> theBrettman, hmm... I think rails or jquery does somehow compensate that
[02:19:33] <adac> otherwise it wouldn't work at all
[02:20:06] <theBrettman> did u check ur inspector for the 404 errors?
[02:22:07] <adac> theBrettman, yes with firebug. all seems ok. the way i posted it it does load both selctboxes at the begining when page is loaded
[02:22:24] <adac> but: when the second box is filled a third action should happen
[02:22:27] <adac> but that does not
[02:22:29] <dddbmt> I have a form with a File field. Is there a way to submit that form via AJAX as soon as the user chooses a new picture? - So I can show the user a preview of the image.
[02:22:51] <aloiscochard> mmm... I think I'll go with kite http://code.google.com/p/kite/
[02:23:12] <adac> theBrettman, it only does work on the second selsectbox when i do select manually
[02:24:33] <theBrettman> put a breakpoint in to see if it gets there
[02:24:40] <theBrettman> and check values when it does
[02:29:33] <theBrettman> where is it getting update-path from?
[02:29:33] <theBrettman> I believe it's out of scope
[02:30:44] <theBrettman> nvm, that was stupid, lol
[02:31:14] <genar> hello! I'm trying to access to already created and functional autocomplete input field to change the source but it doesn't work... the selector is the same of the create code and no autocomplete options or methods work. Somebody knows what i'm doing wrong?
[02:32:31] <Cork> genar: jquery-ui's autocomplete?
[02:32:35] <theBrettman> oh, there's a problem with fiddle showing old code if u don't update it. and it's showing the code without the ;
[02:33:32] <genar> Cork,  yes
[02:34:02] <Cork> and your running autocomplete('options', 'source', '<new source>') ?
[02:34:12] <Cork> s/options/option/
[02:35:16] <genar> yes, like: $('#field_id').autocomplete("option","source",["1","2","3"...]);
[02:35:34] <genar> but no other method is working
[02:35:49] <genar> neither .autocomplete("destroy") ...
[02:36:55] <Cork> not sure what would cause that
[02:37:12] <theBrettman> adac, don't use .text()
[02:37:17] <theBrettman> us .val()
[02:37:27] <adac> theBrettman, ok
[02:37:42] <theBrettman> oh, nvm... I see why u did
[02:37:58] <theBrettman> does the 2nd one change the first one?
[02:38:57] <theBrettman> I'm not sure I know what this thing is supposed to do
[02:39:18] <genar> Cork, thx maybe is a problem of javascript runtime order or something like that...
[02:39:26] <theBrettman> yeah, u wanna send val()
[02:39:56] <theBrettman> y is dataType script?
[02:40:04] <Cork> genar: that shouldn't leav option working if it was...
[02:40:20] <Cork> genar: might be something is extending autocomplete in a breaking way
[02:40:48] <muzone> What's wrong with animate() at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/35/ - #main-menu should appear when one hovers that big orange field.
[02:41:30] <io__> hi have a url variable, i d like to pull the last argument like so url=myurl/foo/bar, so that i can pull "bar" and use it like so = $('mydiv-bar').
[02:42:15] <theBrettman> I think u will have to try this on your own server after those changes, adac
[02:42:34] <genar> maybe, I'm going to see the code of the library because is provided by a symfony plugin and could be a modified version...
[02:43:08] <sYFFAN> is the jqueryui menu widget in a usable state? also, when is the jqueryui 1.9 release planned?
[02:43:39] <Cork> io__: var url = 'myurl/foo/bar'; url = url.split('/'); url[url.length-1]
[02:43:39] <theBrettman> I g2g sleepy tiem! gn
[02:43:57] <adac> theBrettman, yes I'm already on it
[02:44:02] <adac> thank you for your hints!
[02:44:15] <theBrettman> hope u got all ur semi-colons!
[02:44:41] <mindis|wurk> Cork cunning, i was going to suggest regexup for catching the desired part
[02:45:10] <jimit> hi
[02:45:32] <Cork> mindis|wurk: regex would actually be harder :)
[02:45:43] <mindis|wurk> i agree
[02:45:47] <adac> theBrettman, hope so too :)
[02:45:48] <Cork> well maby not
[02:45:57] <adac> sleep well theBrettman
[02:46:14] <mindis|wurk> i'd say it probably is since you still have to get rid of the / that gets included
[02:46:19] <Cork> mindis|wurk: /[^\/]+$/.match()  :)
[02:48:05] <Marko_> theBrettman: thx for example I think what I want to do is move scroll down? Look at fnish rather then send some element down
[02:48:29] <Marko_> TheLittleOne: starcraft player fan ? ;)
[02:51:11] <io__> Cork: what is the name of my new variable (bar?) ?
[02:51:17] <_ramo> hi
[02:51:34] <Cork> io__: both those commandos returns the value
[02:51:38] <_ramo> can i dynamicall generate and random id if a element is loaded and use that id in another functions?
[02:51:40] <Cork> io__: you can use what ever you like
[02:53:15] <Cork> ?eval var url='myurl/foo/bar'; var last_part = url.match(/[^\/]+$/)[0]; print(last_part)
[02:53:20] <bot-t> Cork: "bar"
[02:54:21] <Cork> ?eval var url='myurl/foo/bar'; var last_part = url.split('/'); last_part = last_part[last_part.length-1]; print(last_par
[02:54:24] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[02:54:35] <Cork> ?eval var url='myurl/foo/bar'; var last_part = url.split('/'); last_part = last_part[last_part.length-1]; print(last_par)
[02:54:37] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: last_par is not defined
[02:54:41] <Cork> -_-'
[02:54:50] <Cork> you get the idea
[02:58:35] <solidus-lake> how come selecting something via $("element.class[data-conversation-id='my_id']"); is not working... is there a special way to access data- attributes?
[03:00:35] <solidus-lake> lameness on my part
[03:00:39] <Cork> solidus-lake: as long as its really set as an attribute, then yes that should work
[03:00:40] <solidus-lake> was mistaking a - for a _
[03:00:44] <Cork> XD
[03:00:56] <Cork> solidus-lake: though selecting on attributes are slow
[03:01:03] <Cork> just so you know that
[03:01:15] <solidus-lake> :P
[03:01:27] <solidus-lake> yeah, i'm forced to use it in this one case
[03:01:37] <Cork> what i meant is id's and classes has reference lists in browsers
[03:01:42] <Cork> to they are REALLY fast to lookup
[03:01:54] <Cork> attribut has to be looked on each element individualy
[03:02:08] <solidus-lake> well, is jquery smart enough to select by class first and only check the attribute if the class exists?
[03:02:09] <Cork> so make sure to try to reduce the number of elements before it gets to that
[03:02:54] <Cork> solidus-lake: selectors work from right to left, so not actually sure how id and class works there
[03:03:08] <Cork> might be it finds it and uses it first, but not sure
[03:04:24] <Cork> solidus-lake: and btw its not jquery that does the selection its sizzle
[03:04:27] <Cork> ?g sizzle
[03:04:28] <bot-t> Cork, Sizzle JavaScript Selector Library - http://sizzlejs.com/
[03:05:20] <solidus-lake> Cork: cool didn't know that
[03:13:50] <genar> someone has used the autocomplete widget of sfFormExtraPlugin from symfony and has been able to acces to autocomplete instance after init?
[03:27:01] <buremba> can I ask a question about jquery ui datepicker?
[03:27:26] <buremba> it seems jquery-ui doesn't have a different irc channel
[03:30:01] <raj> go ahead
[03:30:57] <buremba> can I disable days after rendering?
[03:31:05] <buremba> in jquery ui datepicker
[03:32:03] <Marko_> Guys I want to be able move cursor / view down when I click on button http://jsfiddle.net/JXvG8/11/
[03:34:18] <buremba> I have an ajax request and when this request completed I want to change the visibility of the days, and I'm not sure a sleep function in beforeShowDay is a good solution or not.
[03:53:17] <bestKoderEver> hiiiiiiiiii

[03:53:33] <bestKoderEver> <span class="orderAccepted" id="statusAccepterad">Förfrågan</span>
[03:53:57] <bestKoderEver> so ive tryed .html("something") .. but no luck..
[03:53:59] <bestKoderEver> any ideas?
[03:55:15] <mindis|wurk> you sure you actually have working jquery, your event is being triggered and all that?
[03:57:15] <bestKoderEver> mindis|wurk yes.. since i can change the attributes of the span..but not the text..
[03:57:29] <bestKoderEver> but this wont work neither..: document.getElementById(tagID).innerHTML = tagData
[03:57:45] <bestKoderEver> huh!
[03:59:55] <bestKoderEver> any ideas?..
[04:01:50] <r3v3rb> hi
[04:04:43] <JackBauer24> bestKoderEver: can you provide live example at http://jsfiddle.net/ ?
[04:06:11] <r3v3rb> anyone able to offer a way to fix this… http://townsmerchant.co.uk/test/index_main.php
[04:06:58] <r3v3rb> when clicking the map it should slide to the div '#largemap' but because my position is incorrect in the div lookup it always returns the wrong position
[04:07:29] <r3v3rb> would i be better assigning a position to each 'slide' as a fake class or attribute?
[04:08:10] <r3v3rb> i am beginning to wish I hadn't offered to do this for free
[04:14:05] <zoot> hei
[04:14:29] <anli_> Will information stored with div.data be freed when the div is removed?

[05:05:51] <kampsun> Skizu: a name value of what?
[05:07:35] <Skizu> Like i've <input type="submit" name="save" value="save" />
[05:07:44] <StevenCodes22> Skizu:  lookup .get() , .post() using Ajax
[05:07:45] <Skizu> Wanna replace that with an anchor tag
[05:09:27] <Skizu> stevencodes, i don't want to put the url as its in the form
[05:12:28] <Skizu> Guess you don't know?
[05:12:52] <kampsun> Wait, do you want to sumbit a form using an anchor instead of <input>?
[05:15:27] <kampsun> Meh, they left
[05:25:27] <StevenCodes22> Good scrolling plugin anyone ?
[05:26:46] <puppen> tinyscrollbar?
[05:27:39] <trodrigues> hi guys. does jquery do any sort of internal selector caching? haven't been a jquery user for some time and can't seem to find a definitive answer to this anywhere
[05:28:33] <Murof> all: Morning folks
[05:29:02] <Marko_>  I need to make program to scroll down when I click on button http://jsfiddle.net/JXvG8/9/.  I found this which was working somewhere else in the code:     $("#start").animate({scrollTop: $("#finish").offset().top},500; but  I can't make it work for me
[05:29:27] <StevenCodes22> puppen:  Trying to make a game with tiles and need to scroll throughm
[05:30:32] <shadykhan> i have a question
[05:30:56] <shadykhan> if i have 3 images with the same class and on hover i want the image to fade
[05:31:03] <shadykhan> how would i make it so all 3 images dont fade
[05:32:43] <puppen> shadykhan: $(".someimageclass").hover(function(){$(this).doSomeFadingThings()}); ?
[05:33:59] <shadykhan> puppen: thx i feel dumb for not using this lol
[05:34:09] <shadykhan> 'this' lol
[05:34:30] <puppen> Don't feel dumb - just learn and grow :D
[05:36:20] <shadykhan> puppen: now i have the problem where if i hover the image will fadeOut and then instantly fadeIN and my mouse is on the image the whole time
[05:36:44] <puppen> o_O
[05:36:58] <puppen> shadykhan, For that one I may have to ask for a peek at your code
[05:37:02] <shadykhan> kk 1 sec

[05:41:08] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: you around?
[05:45:54] <leo> @io__ add a space after "solid" no ?
[05:46:46] <io__> yes :)
[05:48:20] <puppen> shadykhan: i think it's something to do with how js registers mouse events.. Not 100%..
[05:48:29] <puppen> shadykhan: but this seemed to work.. http://pastebin.com/5KYMkbpQ
[05:48:42] <jeffsmykil> anyone have any idea how to debug in chrome when it just goes straight to the awe snap page and every other browser works?
[05:50:00] <shadykhan> puppen: thank you
[05:50:38] <puppen> 'scool.. Was just curious about the opacity thing, but jQuery's magic seems to make it work in old IE, etc...

[06:08:18] <io__> hi anybody know s how to apply rgba color to a border ? i amusing  a .browser function to fix the lack of rgba support in IE, it works for backgrounds but how to use ti for borders?
[06:08:53] <jeffsmykil> can you set a to borders?
[06:09:00] <io__> sure
[06:09:12] <io__> at least in css3
[06:10:41] <Taloncor> Which plugin should I use if i want to enable bookmarking and history within a rails application which uses jQuery?
[06:12:18] <quicksilver> ideally structure your application correctly in the first place and use URLs sensibly so bookmarking just works.
[06:12:22] <quicksilver> failing that - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/files/jquery-ba-bbq-js.html
[06:13:26] <Taloncor> structure my application correctly? Thats quite hard if you use a lot of unobtrusive javascript, ajax and co.
[06:15:10] <danzik171> Taloncor: sounds like you want to see Backbone.js ( and their Backbone.Router )
[06:15:56] <Taloncor> quicksilver: bbq seems to be outdated. (last update late 2010)
[06:16:02] <Taloncor> danzik171: I'll look into that
[06:16:17] <quicksilver> true but I think it still works.
[06:16:32] <sphinxxx> can anyone recommend a very minimal jquery slider
[06:16:41] <sphinxxx> with dot navigation,  no fancy styling
[06:16:55] <quicksilver> I think backbone solves a bunhc of different problems
[06:17:03] <quicksilver> only some of which are related to the question your asked
[06:18:44] <Taloncor> Yeah, i just need history and bookmarking. Is there any history plugin which is still maintained?
[06:19:58] <trevor_> check this out https://github.com/balupton/History.js/
[06:22:20] <Taloncor> Thanks :)
[06:25:26] <Marko_> guys when using .animate({scrollTop:0}, 'slow');   what does  object on which I call it should be? I saw body and html used
[06:28:57] <Taloncor> balupton / history.js seems quite easy and no too outdated :)
[06:30:51] <Surrealis1> im using: e.preventDefault();  to prevent an default onclick event but the damn thing still fires
[06:31:24] <Surrealis1> <input type="button" name="ctl00$MainContent$ctl245" value="General Information" onclick="javascript:__doPostBack(&#39;ctl00$MainContent$ctl245&#39;,&#39;&#39;)" class="submitButton" style="width:200px;display:block;" />
[06:31:30] <Surrealis1> thats the button.
[06:31:42] <Surrealis1> this is the jQuery
[06:31:43] <Surrealis1> $(this).click(function (e) {                     e.preventDefault();                     ButtonClicked = this;                     $.blockUI({ message: $('#question'), css: { width: '275px'} });                 });
[06:32:03] <Surrealis1> any ideas?
[06:32:08] <Taloncor> Surrealis1: Could you provide this as an jsfiddle? That makes things alot easier ;)
[06:32:13] <Surrealis1> ohhhh
[06:32:19] <Surrealis1> uno momento
[06:32:34] <Taloncor> Stupid Emoticons *narf*
[06:33:18] <Surrealis1> actually thats a bit harder than i expected being this is asp.net and
[06:36:28] <Taloncor> Surrealis1: I'm note sure if onclick handlers counts as default
[06:36:52] <Surrealis1> it seems that the "onclick" on the button is firing before the wireup of the ".click" is firing
[06:37:18] <larsemil> Surrealis1: u not able to remove the onclick="" ?
[06:37:27] <Surrealis1> sadly no
[06:37:34] <Surrealis1> but i can prepend the silly thing
[06:38:47] <Surrealis1> once again im convinced that i should of used mvc and razor
[06:38:53] <Surrealis1> damn you management
[06:39:17] * Surrealis1 shakes fist in the air at a random MBA
[06:42:16] <Marko_> guys when using .animate({scrollTop:0}, 'slow');   what does  object on which I call it should be? I saw body and html used
[06:43:18] <blackspotwiggins> Marko_, use both for compatibility
[06:44:05] <Marko_> blackspotwiggins: hmm I used it in one case but i need to use one of children
[06:44:48] <blackspotwiggins> then you should call it on whatever you need to animate

[07:10:34] <Surrealis1> that works
[07:10:43] <ilteris_> hey guys, is pageinit event default Jquery event?
[07:10:45] <io__> i tried http://pastebin.com/3BgSwAYg but it deosn t work
[07:10:48] <Surrealis1> but  var collection = $('#' + rbContainerId + ' :radio', '#' + rbContainerId + ' :checkbox');
[07:10:51] <Surrealis1> that doesnt work
[07:11:01] <ilteris_> Surrealis1: use a pastie dude
[07:11:15] <blackspotwiggins> Surrealis1, they do different things
[07:11:28] <phil-adept> hi all
[07:11:41] <Surrealis1> how so, i was told i could chain the selections
[07:11:43] <blackspotwiggins> Surrealis1, probably you dont have many radiobuttons nested inside checkboxes
[07:11:55] <phil-adept> if I want to use JS / jQuery to create a new html, then target that element in further code before appending it to the markup, what is the best method?
[07:11:58] <Surrealis1> ahhhh
[07:12:05] <Surrealis1> so its not chained like that
[07:12:06] <phil-adept> a new html *element that should read
[07:12:18] <blackspotwiggins> protip: look at method signatures before you use them
[07:12:25] <Surrealis1> its a "chain" for the selector, not mutiple selections back to back
[07:12:42] <phil-adept> Is it as simple as $myElement = $('<div></div>');
[07:15:44] <karstenk1977_> I have a problem with a selector is there someone wo can help?
[07:16:06] <phil-adept> what is it karstenk1977_?
[07:16:10] <NoiseEee> phil-adept: yes

[07:18:18] <tom[]> my custom jui stylesheet (from themeroller) specifies font-size and -family for select elements. this is causing trouble. is there a css way to reset these back to what the UA stylesheet set? or must i edit the themeroller css file?

It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[07:25:48] <redsquare> afternoon chaps - If I remove an element that has a promise bound to it does the promise get ditched and not done?

[07:26:33] <lduros> hello, I'm running an $.ajax call, but I'd like the jsonpCallback to call a method within the current object literal, rather than a function at the global scope. so it would run this.myCallback, rather than myCallback, any idea how to do that ?
[07:27:02] <quicksilver> jsonpCallbacks have to be global.
[07:27:10] <lduros> they can't be local?
[07:27:13] <quicksilver> however you can set up a global function which calls something.something
[07:27:17] <lduros> or i mean, within an object literal
[07:27:18] <lduros> hmm ok
[07:27:29] <quicksilver> when I said they have to be global, I did indeed mean they can't be local.
[07:27:34] <lduros> quicksilver: right, so just a global function, and then this.myMethodCallback() within it would be ok
[07:27:38] <quicksilver> yes.
[07:27:52] <quicksilver> because they are run in fresh script tags.
[07:27:59] <lduros> so what's the reason why it has to be global just curious
[07:28:02] <lduros> aaha
[07:28:03] <lduros> ok
[07:28:06] <lduros> you answered my question
[07:28:09] <quicksilver> jsonp is like <script>mycallback({JSON goes here});</script>
[07:28:12] <quicksilver> that's what jsonp means.
[07:28:21] <lduros> right
[07:28:22] <quicksilver> and <script> tags are always run in global scope.
[07:29:08] <quicksilver> but you can write function mycallback(json) { foo.bar(json); };
[07:29:08] <lduros> quicksilver: right ok :-)
[07:29:22] <lduros> yep, that's what I'm planning on doing :-) hehe
[07:29:28] <quicksilver> and you can change it
[07:29:33] <quicksilver> mycallback is just a global variable
[07:29:34] <quicksilver> so you can do
[07:29:45] <quicksilver> mycallback = function(json) { baz.bam(json); }
[07:29:47] <quicksilver> to change it.
[07:30:04] <quicksilver> however remember that jsonp is asynchronous and if you have two pending at the same time using the same callback you might get confused...
[07:30:08] <quicksilver> but I'm sure you can work it out.
[07:30:35] <redsquare> ok if anyone is interested dont remove an element that has an associated promise otherwise it does not get resolved - use .detach and .removeData
[07:30:42] <lduros> quicksilver: yeh, I'll be careful about that, aren't there way to tell when it's complete anyway?
[07:32:04] <quicksilver> lduros: well when it's complete your callback gets called :)
[07:32:09] <quicksilver> so that's when you know it's complete.
[07:32:16] <moldy> hi
[07:32:37] <lduros> quicksilver: so if i make a jsonp request by click, and the person double clicks
[07:32:40] <lduros> let's say
[07:32:53] <lduros> is there  a specific way to queue them?
[07:32:59] <quicksilver> then it will run twice and your callback gets called twice
[07:33:02] <quicksilver> that might be fine
[07:33:25] <lduros> because i have multiple buttons that change the query string, but the callback name remains the same
[07:33:30] <lduros> for caching purposes
[07:33:44] <lduros> so people can make multiple selections, deselect, etc
[07:33:57] <lduros> all these generate requests with the same jsonpcallback
[07:34:42] <lduros> googling it maybe i'll find something about it
[07:36:42] <mantas322> Uncaught Error: INVALID_STATE_ERR: DOM Exception 11
[07:36:48] <mantas322> oh jquery
[07:36:51] <mantas322> u so crazy!
[07:37:00] <lduros> quicksilver: or maybe I should make a 5 second delay, after the last click on a button
[07:37:22] <lduros> this way only the last request is performed
[07:37:30] <lduros> sounds like a better deal
[07:45:36] <snagnever> hey!  i have a <div> with many elements inside... i wanted a onmousemove on the div, but this event is triggered when the mouse moves in children element. i've tried .stopPropagation and stuff, but no success. how solve htis?
[07:46:37] <Phil-Work> snagnever, you can get the element that it was triggered on from the event
[07:47:29] <phil-adept> can anyone help with this?... I have a form, on submission I'm validating. Within the validation, I'm using .html() to insert elements into markup to show warnings etc, however that returns true on completion and submits the form. How can I prevet this?...
[07:47:35] <snagnever> phil-work you mean like if( is_the_expected_element ) { do stuff } else { do nothing } ?
[07:47:36] <phil-adept> prevent*
[07:47:49] <Phil-Work> snagnever, yeh
[07:48:21] <snagnever>   Phil-Work thx
[07:48:29] <Phil-Work> phil-adept, pastebin your code
[07:49:31] <StevenCodes22> phil-adept: return false; at the end of the sccript
[07:49:31] <brettster> what is the correct way to do this
[07:49:31] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3257156
[07:49:34] <Taloncor> phil-adept: return false if your validation fails?
[07:49:39] <brettster> i know im doing something wrong
[07:49:53] <brettster> dont i have to chain the next funciton with the fx function somehow
[07:49:56] <brettster> same for previous?
[07:50:36] <phil-adept> phil-work: can't you grab the elements like $movableDivs = $('#containingDiv').children(); and then apply the onMouse to .each() in that list?
[07:50:54] <phil-adept> no you're all misunderstanding....
[07:51:00] <phil-adept> validation works fine
[07:51:06] <snagnever> PHil-work strangely, the currentTarget is always the same...
[07:51:08] <phil-adept> I'll pastie to demonstrate
[07:51:53] <brettster> someone?
[07:52:12] <Phil-Work> snagnever, I don't remember how you get the element
[07:52:14] <diverdude> Did anybody ever use the jquery-custom-content-scroller ? And do you know how to change the scroller direction?
[07:52:18] <Phil-Work> nor where I've done it :/
[07:54:15] <sphinxxx> is there any way to test for when images are loaded without using window.load?
[07:54:29] <sphinxxx> b/c window.load alo waits for everything else, including tracking pixels, which can take a lot longer to load

[07:58:33] <phil-adept> Ooopos... Forgot one thing
[07:59:53] <phil-adept> right, fixed the pastie. Can you tell me why .html() returns true and submits the form?...
[08:00:16] <StevenCodes22> phil-adept:  like i said put return false; at the end of the script
[08:00:50] <phil-adept> StevenCodes22: Line 19 fella ;)
[08:02:49] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[08:03:19] <Taloncor> phil-adept: The return false is actually in the errorMsg onClick handler

[08:03:56] <Toerkeium> hello phil-adept
[08:03:57] <Toerkeium> I'm instantiatin a dialog on document ready, and I would like in the sentense that I use to call the dialog('open') pass an ID which will be assigned in the div. Do you know how can I accomplish this?
[08:04:08] <Toerkeium> I'm very very new to jquery
[08:05:06] <phil-adept> Taloncor: bugger, I've written the pastie wrong again. Pulling the lines I've not commented out in a whole heap of shit... brb, got to retype this pastie, it's not like that in my markup...
[08:05:33] <Toerkeium> this is because I'd like to open multiple dialogs with different ids using the same dialog I instantiated on document ready
[08:06:33] <phil-adept> Right, fixed the pastie...
[08:07:10] <phil-adept> Taloncor: If I comment line 16 out, it works as intended. It's not a source error, .html() seems to return true
[08:08:10] <Taloncor> phil-adept: I try to look into that but jsfiddle is kinda slow today
[08:11:40] <phil-adept> http://jsfiddle.net/QVZNm/

[08:20:38] <phil-adept> Toerkeium: how are you instantiating your dialog?
[08:20:44] <phil-adept> jQuery UI?
[08:20:49] <Toerkeium> yes phil-adept
[08:20:51] <Taloncor> phil-adept: glad to help. Now i can try to fix my own ******* problems.
[08:21:18] <sphinxxx> is there any way to retrieve an xml file cross domain?

[08:22:09] <fris> getjson ?
[08:22:11] <JJJ_> I've tried with unbind() but not sure how to use it properly, as it didn't fix the issue
[08:23:15] <phil-adept> Toerkeium: you can asign an ID to the element and THEN make it a dialog
[08:23:20] <sphinxxx> i already have the data formatted in xml (a lot of data), so i'd prefer not to have to convert to json
[08:23:34] <starsinmypockets> ajax then?

[08:23:54] <phil-adept> Sphinx: http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/ajax_xmlfile.asp
[08:24:01] <phil-adept> have you tried that?
[08:24:05] <Toerkeium> phil-adept: I'm creating the div while I instantiate the dialog
[08:24:45] <Toerkeium> phil-adept: you say I can't pass and ID while calling the dialog?
[08:24:46] <phil-adept> Toerkeium: on line 6 you asign an ID?...
[08:24:54] <phil-adept> no you can, you're already doing that
[08:24:55] <ssj> hey can anyone tell me
[08:25:05] <Toerkeium> phil-adept: yes, that's what I should modify, if possible
[08:25:21] <Toerkeium> phil-adept: that's what I've done till now
[08:25:25] <ssj> how can i copy the text user has highlighted to clipboard

[08:25:41] <phil-adept> Toerkeium: var $dialog = $('<div id="' + $myID + '"></div>')
[08:26:26] <Toerkeium> phil-adept: and how should I send the id while I call dialog('open')?
[08:26:31] <JSD> Hey all. I am looking for a fast sorting plugin (I've tried tinySort but it uses the Array.sort()). It takes more than a second to do 1064 elements and dies miserably past that. Anyone here handled sets of 10,000+ elements in array.sort?
[08:26:36] <ssj> anyone?
[08:27:30] <JJJ_> http://jsfiddle.net/E7ET9/ here's the code, I just want to know if there's a way to clear it out before reloading it in an AJAX request, to prevent memory leaks
[08:28:44] <NoiseEee> JSD: why oh why are there that many elements anywhere at once?
[08:29:07] <Toerkeium> phil-adept: don't go! :)
[08:30:31] <JSD> NoiseEee: corporate app. :(
[08:30:35] <JSD> do what you're told
[08:35:30] <phil-adept> toerkeuim, I'm not tusre what you mean, the ID is already there, as you have defined it
[08:35:48] <ssj> anyone here?
[08:36:48] <Toerkeium> phil-adept: that's what I want to change. I don't want to have it defined in the instantiation, I want to define the ID when I call dialog('open'), as I'm going to open more than 1 dialogs and I don't want them to be in conflict
[08:36:57] <phil-adept> ssj: 'sup?

[08:39:30] <cccaldas> hi guys
[08:39:42] <beardbar> is there an easy way to return the value returned as a negative? http://scrp.at/a1M
[08:39:43] <cccaldas> anyone know how can i use dispatchEvent native ?
[08:42:21] <phil-adept> beardbar you want the value as a negative?....
[08:42:28] <Zzaichik> beardbar: add in:  '-' +  to the beginning?
[08:42:44] <phil-adept> beardbar: tick a - in or margin = margin * -1?
[08:42:57] <phil-adept> lol @ Zzaichik, you're faster
[08:43:48] <Zzaichik> haha - I probably just noticed the question earlier or something
[08:44:16] <Zzaichik> http://scrp.at/a1N
[08:45:19] <shodan45> what causes error messages to not display in firebug, etc.?
[08:45:57] <shodan45> seems if there's an error in an event handler, it doesn't get send to firebug's console, for example
[08:46:53] <ssj> how can i copy highlighted text to clipboard?
[08:46:57] <ssj> on click
[08:47:04] <Zzaichik> shodan45: sometimes the error isn't syntax related, or it's well hidden. To get it to return an error you have to activate that event handler. Honestly, it could be a lot of different things.
[08:47:06] <ssj> on press of a key
[08:47:49] <shodan45> Zzaichik: "activate"? you mean cause it to run?
[08:48:07] <Zzaichik> ssj: Google is your friend - http://bit.ly/zcWJSO
[08:48:28] <Zzaichik> shodan45: yeah that's what I meant. sorry. Trigger the event, cause it to run, etc.
[08:49:25] <Zzaichik> shodan45:  what you can do is put in a console.log('its working!'); or something, inside the event handler and find out where it's breaking - make sure it's responding properly when triggered.
[08:49:31] <shodan45> Zzaichik: that's what I'm doing :) something somewhere is broken & I'm having to manually put console.log('a1'); etc. everywhere
[08:49:37] <shodan45> Zzaichik: yeah :)
[08:49:56] <Zzaichik> shodan45: Well, I'd have to see it at this point to be any help.
[08:50:17] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible to somehow get the underlying DOM element of a jquery sortable, from within one of the callbacks?
[08:50:42] <shodan45> just very annoying that there's no error message :(
[08:51:03] <Zzaichik> Yeah I hear ya. I've run into those problems before. Usually ends up being something stupid. haha
[08:51:24] <shodan45> Zzaichik: eh, it's several levels deep in event handlers, etc.
[08:51:49] <ssj> ty Zzaichik
[08:51:53] <phil-adept> Taloncor: I Was wrong... I've updated the JSFiddle to demonstrate. I've copied all the code CSS and JS too to show
[08:51:54] <Zzaichik> Ahhh - Well, I'd say stop looking at it for a minute. And then come back to it and start from the beginning.
[08:51:57] <phil-adept> http://jsfiddle.net/QVZNm/5/
[08:51:58] <ssj> didnt want to use
[08:52:00] <ssj> zclip
[08:52:05] <ssj> and zeroclipboard
[08:52:14] <ssj> the other codes are good
[08:52:27] <Luke_Beer> Hey, is anyone familiar with tablesorter? I'm having a problem when if a cell has a - in it, for instance 'something-sometext-somethingelse' it creates a new line inside the cell after each '-'
[08:52:29] <jeffsmykil> finding the edge coordinates of an element being hovered over?
[08:52:59] <phil-adept> jeffsmykil you want to find the .offset() and widths and do some maths
[08:53:19] <jeffsmykil> yeah I just figured that out
[08:53:29] <jeffsmykil> phil-adept: will i run into stupid browser specifics?
[08:53:50] <ngharo> is there a "does not have attribute" selector?
[08:54:41] <shodan45> Zzaichik: aaaaand yep it was stupid. >_> "appenTo"
[08:55:03] <Zzaichik> shodan45: lol - usually is. I'm glad you found it
[08:55:27] <phil-adept> shouldn't do. use CSS width (x-browser isn't an issue with the width element)  and.offset should return the correct values since jQuery handled much of the browser specific bits for that  I think
[08:56:05] <mattp_> is $.data() a reliable key value store across browsers?
[08:56:25] <waxjar> this has been bugging me for `Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete'`. does anyone know what causes this?
[08:56:33] <jeffsmykil> ty phil-adept
[08:57:12] <xec> waxjar: there could be a myriad of reasons, but my guess is you haven't included the autocomplete plugin
[08:57:36] <JJJ_> can someone tell me what in this code makes the garbage collector not seem to work? and eats up tons of memory when retriggered on ajax calls? http://jasx.org/lsl/jfish/plugins/atooltip/js/jquery.atooltip.js
[08:57:43] <waxjar> i have, i just downloaded a fresh query ui file with every component in it
[08:57:46] <xec> waxjar: or you included it after the calling code
[08:58:03] <waxjar> nope, query, jquery-ui, my own horrible js
[08:58:09] <waxjar> *jquery
[08:58:10] <JJJ_> It's up at about 200mb memory after about 43 ajax calls
[08:58:17] <phil-adept> mattP_: ive had no issues, however HTML5's data attr isn't compatible with jQueries so keep that in mind
[08:58:17] <xec> waxjar: is your site live somewhere?
[08:58:31] <waxjar> yes, http://nearupon.com/
[08:58:33] <snover> phil-adept: wat?
[08:58:44] <waxjar> i didn't enable autocomplete there yet, though
[08:58:50] <snover> define “compatible with jQueries”
[08:59:34] <xec> ?demo @ waxjar
[08:59:35] <bot-t> waxjar, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:00:03] <phil-adept> Snover: http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[09:00:22] <phil-adept> Different naming conventions
[09:00:48] <phil-adept> data-my-div-name = data('myDivName')
[09:01:07] <snover> that is actually the exact same naming convention used by the html5 dataset api
[09:02:05] <Luke_Beer> How do I handle a dash in cells in tablesorter? after every - it creates a new line and makes the table look a bit messy
[09:02:23] <snover> element . http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#dom-dataset Returns a http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#domstringmap object for the element's http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#attr-data attributes. Hyphenated names become camel-cased. For example, data-foo-bar="" becomes element.dataset.fooBar. —HTML5 §3.2.3.8
[09:02:33] <snover> that said
[09:02:44] <phil-adept> Snover: They are different in markup / JS. I was simply pointing that out... What's the problem?...
[09:02:59] <snover> you said they were not compatible
[09:03:15] <phil-adept> I correct my comment, however they aren't the 'same'
[09:03:20] <phil-adept> get off youor high horse
[09:03:39] <waxjar> that's weird. it does seem to work in jsfiddle xec
[09:03:50] <snover> excuse me, my horse has a genetic abnormality that caused it to grow extremely long legs
[09:03:54] <snover> I will thank you not to draw attention to it
[09:03:54] <xec> phil-adept: snover is just presenting facts. i was a bit confused with your "incompatible" statement as well
[09:03:55] <phil-adept> lol
[09:05:17] <waxjar> $.() is the domReady handler event right?
[09:05:23] <phil-adept> I've said I correct that, semntically they aren't the same, and using $('#myDiv').data('my-attr') would not work for an element with data-my-attr set. My bad, no need to beat someone with it?...
[09:05:50] <snover> The fact of the matter is that $.fn.data should have *never* been changed to read data attrs
[09:06:20] <phil-adept> Snover: I agree
[09:06:55] <brettster> hey guys
[09:06:56] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3257602
[09:07:00] <brettster> what am i doing wrong
[09:07:07] <brettster> i need the slider to stop
[09:07:12] <brettster> when the video is clicked to play
[09:07:15] <brettster> how can i do that
[09:07:21] <xec> waxjar: $(function(){ ... }) or $(document).ready(function(){ ... })
[09:07:21] <brettster> right now it only stops on hover
[09:07:54] <xec> waxjar: i actually prefer the latter, as it is easier to see what it's for
[09:08:26] <giocchi27> ciao
[09:08:28] <giocchi27> !list
[09:08:41] <giocchi27> !list;
[09:08:45] <giocchi27> wtf
[09:08:55] <brettster> someone?
[09:09:33] <jonh321> anonymous deface fbi site -> http://imgchili.com/show/4392/4392629_british81.jpg
[09:09:40] <xec> brettster: what plugin is this?
[09:09:49] <brettster> jcycle
[09:09:52] <brettster> so i have a div
[09:10:00] <brettster> with an iframe to a youtube video
[09:10:07] <brettster> when the user clicks to play the youtube video
[09:10:14] <brettster> i want the slide to stop
[09:10:22] <brettster> and delay for the amount of time the video is
[09:10:26] <brettster> is that possible?
[09:10:32] <xec> ah. i'm not so sure you can listen to click events happening inside a flash plugin
[09:11:08] <ravenzz> embed it instead
[09:11:27] <xec> ravenzz: it will still be a flash plugin?
[09:11:57] <ravenzz> you can use the swfobject apis
[09:12:07] <ravenzz> or you can use the html5 player
[09:12:39] <ravenzz> or use the jw flv player and its js apis
[09:12:54] <danzik17> there any way to make the loading of an iframe synchronous?
[09:13:27] <NoiseEee> no, but you can call a function in the parent window when it loads (assuming the iframe obeys SOP)
[09:13:40] <NoiseEee> "you can call a function" / "it can call a function"
[09:14:11] <danzik17> NoiseEee: nah, the use case makes it absolutely necessary that it be sync, not a continuation/callback.  tks though.
[09:15:01] <xec> danzik17: just curious, what use case?
[09:16:07] <danzik17> xec: its a crossdomain plugin i wrote that's used internally, but the first call to a target subdomain absolutely has to be async regardless of if you specify sync or async.  subsequent calls will honor it
[09:16:25] <danzik17> that can obviously cause some hard to find bugs if someone is using sync ( and its the first call )
[09:19:47] <BFranks> Really obvious question.. "How do I de-select or select none" with this method: http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/#display-grid ?
[09:20:04] <BFranks> (Obvious as in I built a page around it and THEn realized I can't de-select)
[09:28:25] <xec> BFranks: i can deselect on mac/ff by holding cmd
[09:28:50] <hazamonzo> Hey folks. Can anyone recommend a good jquery carousel plugin? There seem to be loads out there and im unsure what one most people consider "the best"
[09:29:43] <Taloncor> Is anybody familiar with the "ehynds / jquery-ui-multiselect"-widget ?
[09:29:51] <erichynds> Taloncor: i am..
[09:30:24] <hazamonzo> Maybe something with captions so i can add links to other things for each carousel item?
[09:31:22] <xec> hazamonzo: i've seen this in use multiple places: http://css-tricks.com/anythingslider-jquery-plugin/
[09:31:37] <xec> never tried it myself though ;)
[09:32:38] <hazamonzo> xec: Thats quiet niec looking. Another kinda requirement that might help is that i would like the user to be able to see other slides next to the focussed slide
[09:32:40] <hazamonzo> kinda like this http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout/demos/standard
[09:33:53] <Taloncor> erichynds: Wonderful. When trying to create a multiselect for a given select, it won't work if i created a multiselect for an select with the same ID before.
[09:34:16] <erichynds> Taloncor: right - id's are unique to 1 element. you need to give it a new id, or use a common class instead
[09:34:35] <Taloncor> erichynds: The element in question should have been destroyed before i recreate it
[09:34:55] <erichynds> destroyed via remove() ?
[09:35:11] <Taloncor> erichynds: It resides in an jquery ui dialog which will be closed
[09:35:28] <Taloncor> erichynds: Example in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sJdKH/1/
[09:36:05] <shadykhan> Is there a way to select a specific class in the child level (i.e. "this" + '> .someClass' ) ?
[09:36:31] <pifantastic> shadykhan: $('foo .class') ?
[09:36:38] <pifantastic> or you mean immediate child?
[09:36:42] <Jayflux> shadykhan $('element .class');
[09:36:55] <Jayflux> or $('element > .class') for direct child of that element
[09:37:05] <Eviltwin> StevenCodes221: $(this).find(">.someClass") or $(this).children(".someClass")
[09:37:05] <NoiseEee> or el.find('.class')
[09:37:11] <Eviltwin> Err
[09:37:13] <Eviltwin> shadykhan: ^
[09:37:16] <shadykhan> is it possible to do $(this > '.class')
[09:37:17] <shadykhan> ??
[09:37:26] <Jayflux> shadykhan yes we just showed you that
[09:37:28] <shadykhan> oh haha thx i was typing and didnt see it
[09:37:32] <pifantastic> shadykhan: not with that syntax
[09:37:38] <erichynds> Taloncor: open the console and open/close a few times, the select box is never actually removed from the DOM even though the dialog is destroyed: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/sJdKH/2/
[09:37:41] <shadykhan> thank you everyone
[09:38:02] <erichynds> Taloncor: so on close, just do dialog.empty().dialog("destroy");
[09:38:49] <Taloncor> erichynds: Just noticed that. Sorry to waste your time.  Since you are properly the creator of the widget in question: Nicely done! :)
[09:39:05] <erichynds> Taloncor: np! and thank you
[09:43:12] <t4nkd> Hey jquery -- what's the best way to conditionally assert if an input contains any text that isn't white space
[09:43:33] <t4nkd> $q.val() == '' wasn't yielding the results I expected
[09:43:59] <Eviltwin> Regular expressions
[09:44:07] <Eviltwin> Or perhaps using $.trim
[09:44:43] <t4nkd> and I can just do $.trim($q.val()) == '' and that should be fine?
[09:44:49] <t4nkd> in theory anyway
[09:45:00] <thang> will trim remove whitespaces that arent at the ends?
[09:45:09] <t4nkd> no
[09:45:14] <t4nkd> beginning and end only
[09:45:23] <Eviltwin> But if the string is only whitespace...
[09:45:36] <t4nkd> It has no middle, in theory
[09:45:47] <Eviltwin> No, not in theory
[09:45:51] <Eviltwin> In reality
[09:46:04] <t4nkd> trim would only know where the beginning and end exist by asserting that the string contains characters that aren't whitespace/tabs
[09:46:13] <t4nkd> otherwise the entire string is a 'beginning'
[09:46:32] <Eviltwin> You're overthinking this
[09:46:56] <t4nkd> If a string is only whitespace, trim, in theory, will return ''
[09:47:07] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[09:47:24] <Eviltwin> What else would it return?
[09:48:08] <t4nkd> I don't know, I was under the assumption you have thought of that scenario which lead to 'But if the string is only whitespace..."
[09:48:19] <thang> undefined, NaN, a gun, wikipedia
[09:48:45] <t4nkd> with javascript, I really can't be sure
[09:48:53] <Eviltwin> Do you know what a regular expression is?
[09:49:14] <t4nkd> Yes
[09:49:29] <Eviltwin> It uses two simple regular expressions to accomplish this
[09:49:50] <t4nkd> I would've been surprised if it worked some other way
[09:49:57] <Eviltwin> s/^\s+// followed by s/\s+$//
[09:50:00] <Surrealis1> i've got something working in ie and ff, but not chrome: http://pastie.org/3257845

[10:01:47] <Damianos> Using jquery 1.4 how can I reload just the css files...I've searched all over google and the only thing I seem to find is to either dump all the rules into a <style> tag (cumbersome) or change the href attribute on the <link> element (which doesn't work)
[10:02:22] <NoiseEee> Damianos: what problem are you solving by "reloading" css files?
[10:03:08] <Damianos> I'm trying to create a design tool that uses css style rule substitution to produce wireframes
[10:03:43] <Damianos> normally I'd use jquery.css() but there are a lot of elements involved ...it's for a CMS
[10:04:15] <NoiseEee> but these css files, they've physically changed since your page has been loaded?
[10:04:25] <JAAulde> I am using jQuery 3.3.9.3 and its jQuery plugin.  The plugin is modifying jQuery.fn.append in such a way that appending a nod to an XML document fails silently. Has anyone here run into this before?
[10:04:36] <JAAulde> erp, sorry, tinymce 3.3.9.3
[10:04:50] <NoiseEee> i mean, the standard is to add/remove class names that are defined elsewhere to adjust display properties Damianos (as I presume you know)
[10:04:55] <Nocatfarts> test
[10:05:10] <Taloncor> Damianos: Changing the href for the stylesheet link works for me
[10:05:17] <Damianos> no...they don't physically change. I want to have a css file called wireframe.css that I can enable or disable via a single button
[10:05:44] <NoiseEee> versus adding a class 'wireframe' on the fly?
[10:05:51] <NoiseEee> and having wireframe.css only apply to .wireframe?
[10:06:14] <Damianos> ok...I just wanted to make sure...I'm using a base theme and they may have a LESS or COMPASS type framework underneath that might be getting in the way
[10:06:51] <Damianos> I'm doing this in  Firefox OSX
[10:07:14] <NoiseEee> i don't know why LESS/COMPASS would make a diff... the way i suggested is by far the best way to go
[10:07:30] <NoiseEee> otherwise, sure change the href of the <style>, or check out http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Totally_Pwn_CSS_with_Javascript
[10:08:06] <tw2113> LESS should be comiling down to a .css file
[10:10:30] <Damianos> ok...some progress....it doesn't work with firebug window open
[10:11:01] <jaequery> quick question for yall
[10:11:24] <Damianos> with firebug closed, upon refresh and reopening firebug...the styles seem to be loaded but nothing on the page has actually changed
[10:13:03] <jaequery> i have a form with multi-dimensional arrays ,  <input name="product[3][name]" ...  etc ...  ,  i'm currently using serializeArray on the form to get all the data to json but it wouldn't seem to work for multi-dimensional inputs, any ideas what i'm doing wrong?
[10:15:00] <adept> jaequery can you provide some source?
[10:15:23] <jaequery> ok i'll see if i can put it up on fiddle
[10:18:33] <jaequery> http://jsfiddle.net/uXCVx/
[10:18:44] <jaequery> check the console log
[10:18:47] <jaequery> after you hit send
[10:19:00] <jaequery> the name comes out like this:
[10:19:00] <jaequery> name: "product[3][price]"
[10:19:10] <jaequery> when it should've been in a product array
[10:22:28] <Murof> jae: what where you trying to do?
[10:23:03] <Murof> jae: yuo did got one array --> [Object { name="product[3][price]", value="25"}, Object { name="product[4][price]", value="12"}, Object { name="product[7][price]", value="32"}]

[10:47:29] <Warmics> why does this http://pastebin.com/dwFMw7uy iterates once instead of every 2 secs?
[10:50:26] <Zzaichik> Warmics: http://pastebin.com/TSBq1v1E
[10:51:00] <Zzaichik> Sorry, I should have explained that to you rather than just doing it. :)
[10:51:09] <Warmics> no, i understand
[10:51:22] <Zzaichik> Do you see what I did?
[10:51:32] <Warmics> adding the function () {}
[10:51:38] <Zzaichik> Yeah. That's the proper way to use setInterval
[10:51:44] <Warmics> i see
[10:52:09] <Warmics> it was confusing because you can do it the way i did without sending any variables and it does work
[10:52:16] <kanja1> chovy: Issue a patch request? Do you mean what would a patch request do on the server?
[10:52:58] <Warmics> http://pastebin.com/KLVithCy this works as expected for instance
[10:53:38] <Zzaichik> Yeah you can - and that way should be just fine too.
[10:53:41] <Surrealis1> interesting enough $(this).attr('required') != undefined)  works in ff and ie
[10:53:50] <Surrealis1> and chrome
[10:54:01] <danzik17> Warmics: it worked because you invoked the function rather than passed it as an argument.  so the return of the function was being used.  you were basically doing the equivalent of setInterval( undefined, 2000 )
[10:54:03] <Surrealis1> but $(this).prop('required') != undefined)  only works in ff and ie
[10:54:09] <Surrealis1> which to me makes no sense now
[10:54:57] <fulcan> can anyone help me? I can't figure out why lavalamp is causing my hyperlinks to fail??   http://jsfiddle.net/zUtMU/
[10:55:50] <Warmics> i'll have to look into it, it's still a little confusing to me

[11:13:00] <DerekPioneer> I am using jquery's serialize function. I have an input field whose value needs to have <content><p>blah</p></content> html tags for the serialize to work correctly. however, i don't want to show the user the <content><p> tags, what do?
[11:14:37] <fulcan> can anyone help me? I can't figure out why lavalamp is causing my hyperlinks to fail??   http://jsfiddle.net/zUtMU/
[11:14:43] <neilk_> DerekPioneer: I don't know what you mean if you want to serialize the HTML without the tags, but maybe you want $( '<content><p>blah</p></content>' ).text();
[11:14:58] <neilk_> or possibly you want .contents()
[11:15:08] <DerekPioneer> http://pastebin.com/GGCMC0mg
[11:15:25] <DerekPioneer> I am using serialize on this fxgClass
[11:15:32] <Zzaichik> DerekPioneer:  I don't get it.  Maybe take the value after they submit it and add that shit.
[11:15:49] <DerekPioneer> I need <content><p> to stay in that value field
[11:15:52] <DerekPioneer> but i don't want to show it to the user
[11:16:03] <DerekPioneer> is there any way to hide it or something?
[11:16:41] <JAAulde> where are the docs on writing custom filters?
[11:16:52] <JAAulde> my googling is returning everythingbut the official page
[11:17:39] <Zzaichik> DerekPioneer: May I ask WHY??
[11:18:10] <DerekPioneer> i am interacting with adobe image servers that use xml files to represent everything in the image
[11:18:44] <DerekPioneer> you can then do things like       adobeimageserver.com/myimage?front_text.setAttr=<content><p>sdfaasdf</p></content>
[11:18:52] <a-l-e> i have a question about jquery.vgrid.js... and wonder if this is a good place to ask...
[11:19:01] <DerekPioneer> front_text has to have the <content> tags around it
[11:19:08] <Zzaichik> So do it actually need to be in the input value or can you add it to the input value AFTER they've entered something?
[11:19:12] <a-l-e> (basically, i don't get the items to be shown side by side, even if there is enough space)
[11:19:19] <DerekPioneer> i can add it after
[11:19:23] <Zzaichik> do = does*
[11:19:38] <Zzaichik> despite how cool that sounded.
[11:19:42] <DerekPioneer> lol
[11:19:54] <DerekPioneer> so i suppose
[11:20:04] <DerekPioneer> there's a way to edit the input value with jquery
[11:20:09] <DerekPioneer> right before i send the serialize function
[11:20:15] <DerekPioneer> and add the <content><p> tags around the input value
[11:20:43] <Zzaichik> exactly
[11:20:54] <a-l-e> and the "problem" is visible in here... http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2012/
[11:21:40] <Zzaichik> So you could do something like;    .val('<content><p>' + val() + '</p></content>');    I wonder if that would work..
[11:24:55] <Zzaichik> Not quite, But you get the idea yeah?
[11:25:48] <monk12> hello all, curious Im using the UI datepicker. i see there is an altFormat/altField option. if i have a datepicker on a many inputs on the page though, Im using a single datepicker line via class selector to cover all of them ... $('.datepicker').datepicker(options); ... but not sure how to make so the altField is relative to the input used with (only seen examples with a single datepicker and therefore 1 ID to change { altField: '#theAltField'}, vs t
[11:25:48] <monk12> he hidden input next to many datepickers).
[11:31:32] <monk12> figure it out via s.overflow.: $('.datepicker').each(f(){ altField: $(this).parent('div.dateholder').find('.hidden-date-input');  })
[11:32:21] <xec-> monk12: you could loop through the datepickers and supply the altField as the next input for each
[11:32:41] <xec-> just like you just said :P
[11:33:41] <monk12> cool :). thanks xec-.
[11:35:16] <shadykhan> how can i make it so if the user clicks during the animation it doesnt revert back
[11:38:18] <snagnever> will google index items on a 'display:none' element?
[11:41:14] <Syco54645_work> how can i post to a page with jquery but load the page as well
[11:41:22] <Syco54645_work> i am having a hard time wording this question
[11:42:46] <xec-> Syco54645_work: you want to just reload the page after a http post?
[11:42:49] <NoiseEee> Syco54645_work: im guessing the page you want to post to (xhr/ajax) would then return markup that you would stick in the DOM ?
[11:43:03] <Syco54645_work> NoiseEee: indeed
[11:43:16] <Syco54645_work> btw, hello again NoiseEee
[11:43:23] <NoiseEee> so thats it really... the page should return some markup, your callback would take it and insert it
[11:43:32] <Toerkeium> guys, is a fact that jquery don't accept \r\n and single quotes? or am I doing something wrong?
[11:43:32] <Syco54645_work> wait
[11:43:34] <Syco54645_work> i read that wrong
[11:43:41] <shadykhan> what?
[11:43:46] <Syco54645_work> i am trying to send post variables to a page
[11:43:52] <xec-> Toerkeium: in what context? see ?demo
[11:43:53] <bot-t1> Toerkeium, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:44:14] <NoiseEee> Syco54645_work: via XHR or a typical form submission (ie: new page location)
[11:44:14] <Toerkeium> sure, thanks
[11:44:22] <Toerkeium> I'll do it xec-, bot-t1
[11:44:24] <Syco54645_work> NoiseEee: i am using $.post
[11:44:51] <shadykhan> how can i make it so if the user clicks during the animation it doesn't revert back
[11:45:40] <NoiseEee> Syco54645_work: okay, so you should have the page that's taking the POSTed info and have it return applicable markup... ie:  {"returnedMarkup":"<div>COMPLETE!</div>"}
[11:46:11] <NoiseEee> Syco54645_work: and your success/done handler takes the returned data and puts it where it should go in the DOM
[11:46:24] <Syco54645_work> NoiseEee: well that would be the correct way to do it yes, but that isnt how it was coded in the first place
[11:46:28] <Syco54645_work> and i am just adding features
[11:46:40] <Syco54645_work> or rather fixing features that never worked in the first place
[11:47:20] <NoiseEee> soooo... whats the issue
[11:47:23] <theBrettman> anyone know how to edit a live stylesheet?
[11:47:55] <NoiseEee> theBrettman: in most cases, if thats your goal, your approach/foundation is flawed
[11:48:07] <theBrettman> not if I'm making and editor
[11:48:24] <theBrettman> in an inspectory, u can adjust the values live
[11:48:33] <theBrettman> just don't know how that works
[11:48:38] <theBrettman> it doesn't change inline styles
[11:48:45] <NoiseEee> theBrettman: i'd start with http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Totally_Pwn_CSS_with_Javascript and then you can jquery-ize some stuff in there
[11:50:06] <theBrettman> thx NoiseEee, wish I had this a long time ago!
[11:51:35] <Toerkeium> it wasn't jquery fault, sorry!
[11:51:46] <Toerkeium> I wasn't scaping right the string
[11:52:08] <Syco54645_work> NoiseEee: the issue is that my brain is fried, think i found the way to do it easier
[11:52:54] <NoiseEee> Syco54645_work: word, good luck
[11:52:58] <NoiseEee> theBrettman: no prob
[11:55:59] <shadykhan> how can i make it so if the user clicks the div during the animation it doesn't revert back
[11:59:25] <AI6K> I just recently, due to conflicts with legacy code, changed my thingy to $j, and now I'm getting 'createdUnk' is undefined, yet have no idea where to start looking, anyone have any helpful advice?
[11:59:54] <NoiseEee> search through your code for 'createdUnk' ?
[11:59:56] <AI6K> The error is being thrown in jquery-1.7.1.min.js, not in my source files :(
[12:00:28] <NoiseEee> AI6K: only because jquery has been asked to something with something that doesn't exist, most likely
[12:00:49] <AI6K> Well, we'll start commenting things out and see what happens.
[12:01:32] <AI6K> Strange, the code runs in FF, but not IE9 or Chrome.
[12:04:36] <JAAulde> where are the official docs on writing custom selectors?
[12:08:42] <AI6K> NoiseEE, thanks, I found my problem. There actually was a variable createdUnk in my program, typo, jeesh.
[12:11:32] <xec-> JAAulde: not sure, but http://docs.jquery.com/DOM/Traversing/Selectors#CSS_Selectors has some links at the bottom, like  http://www.malsup.com/jquery/expr/
[12:15:32] <JAAulde> xec-: ok, cool, thanks.  Those are what I was seeing in my googling.  I guess my real question is, when providing a custom selector as a function, is it the standard that the function should be returning a truly BOOL value?
[12:17:04] <JAAulde> I ask because I found a bug in the tinymce jQuery plugin and want to verify my thoughts are correct
[12:17:07] <xec-> JAAulde: i think truthy/falsy is sufficient
[12:17:23] <JAAulde> xec-: seems if it returns undefined, the check fails
[12:17:24] <xec-> JAAulde: but don't take my word for it
[12:17:29] <Syco54645_work> NoiseEee: i got it sorted out now
[12:18:06] <JAAulde> false and empty string are ok when desiring to say it didn't match, but undefined apparently is not
[12:18:23] <JAAulde> if the func returns undefined, is() and filter() are told the element matched
[12:19:02] <xec-> JAAulde: what if you slap !! in your return statement
[12:19:31] <JAAulde> xec-: that would fix it.  this is internal to tinymce, though, so I want to submitt hat as a patch and tell them why it is the fix.  was hoping for some official docs to back it up
[12:19:58] <xec-> ah, I see
[12:47:41] <darrennnn> hello #jquery. simple, commented, example isnt working how i expect. thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/ZjSH7/
[12:50:05] <Eviltwin> What did you expect?
[12:50:12] <darrennnn> its written in the comments
[12:50:28] <someprimetime> it says Y U NO WORK
[12:50:32] <someprimetime> why doesn't what work?
[12:51:02] <darrennnn> uym, in the right hand corner you can try it and see that it behaves very weird.
[12:51:08] <darrennnn> sometimes they fade themselves in and out
[12:51:17] <darrennnn> sometimes they fade in and out simulteneously.
[12:51:26] <darrennnn> i thought it would be pretty clear.
[12:51:34] <Eviltwin> Well here's the problem
[12:51:41] <Eviltwin> $(".ajax a").each(function() { ... })
[12:51:44] <Eviltwin> How many times does the ... run?
[12:52:10] <someprimetime> 3 times right
[12:52:12] <darrennnn> obviously im a newb, but i thought i understood that it would run once on each of the a's found
[12:52:13] <darrennnn> correct
[12:52:19] <darrennnn> 3 times in this case.
[12:52:45] <someprimetime> i think you want it to run only once, right?
[12:52:46] <someprimetime> once for each one?
[12:53:04] <darrennnn> wait, wha?
[12:53:27] <darrennnn> so i am thinking my code was designed to go to the a's. when it finds the first one it says "what is your href? okay hide that p."
[12:53:35] <darrennnn> then goes to the next one and next after that doing the same.
[12:53:48] <Eviltwin> Ignore someprimetime for a sec
[12:53:52] <darrennnn> ok
[12:54:06] <Eviltwin> So we know the fadeOut block runs three times, right?
[12:54:19] <Eviltwin> That also means the callback will run 3 times
[12:54:23] <someprimetime> actually you can just ignore me indefinitely
[12:55:00] <Eviltwin> If you call fadeOut and fadeIn on an element multiple times, it can cause behaviors like this
[12:55:02] <Zzaichik> duly noted.
[12:55:08] <Eviltwin> You don't actually want the target to fade in multiple times
[12:55:41] <darrennnn> i think i follow you better
[12:55:47] <xec-> also.... do you really intend to loop through all links on any click..?
[12:55:49] <darrennnn> i need a bit of a push in the right direction though
[12:55:55] <darrennnn> do i have to check against visibility?
[12:56:19] <darrennnn> xec-: uhhh i guess not? (embarassed)
[12:56:22] <xec-> darrennnn: what do you want the behavior to be?
[12:56:57] <darrennnn> id like, when clicking the link, the proper P shows after the visible one fades out
[12:57:34] <darrennnn> and i thought the easiest way, and most flexible, would be to find the potential targets and make sure they were faded out
[12:57:50] <darrennnn> and then store the target and fire it in the callback after the animations finished
[12:57:57] <darrennnn> to reveal the actual clicked target.
[12:58:02] <darrennnn> (i hope that made sense)
[12:58:25] <Zzaichik> .each() is not necessary here. Simplify. Right?
[12:58:40] <Eviltwin> I think you want this: http://jsfiddle.net/ZjSH7/2/
[12:59:36] <darrennnn> Eviltwin: i would have to study it further however, yours is also simulteneously fading in the new target, and out the old target.
[13:00:14] <xec-> i started one too :) http://jsfiddle.net/ZjSH7/3/
[13:00:56] <darrennnn> xec-: same problem. silmulteneous fadein/out
[13:01:13] <xec-> ye, but at least its simpler :D
[13:01:18] <neilk_> siebrand: I'm on Skype, waiting for Trevor to arrive
[13:01:19] <darrennnn> true. much simpler.
[13:01:46] <neilk_> I'm starting to think we shouldn't have booked this meeting in the room that still smells of paint fumes
[13:01:52] <xec-> darrennnn: http://jsfiddle.net/ZjSH7/4/
[13:01:57] <xec-> hehe, ugly hack time
[13:02:16] <darrennnn> haha
[13:02:24] <darrennnn> that is certainly how i expected it to work.
[13:02:31] <Zzaichik> probably ought to kill the queue too..
[13:02:36] <darrennnn> whats up with the callback of fadeOut?
[13:02:52] <darrennnn> it just seems like it isnt working
[13:03:42] <Eviltwin> Oh, looks like you might need a deferred to make this work 100% correct
[13:06:13] <Eviltwin> ndhttp://jsfiddle.net/ZjSH7/8/
[13:06:16] <Eviltwin> darrennnn: http://jsfiddle.net/ZjSH7/8/
[13:06:57] <darrennnn> that looks perfect and i cant imagine how i would have figured that out
[13:07:02] <darrennnn> thank you everyone who tried to help.
[13:07:20] <darrennnn> so now, just questions. was i using the fadeout callback wrong? i thought it would work
[13:07:34] * darrennnn opens up jquery docs for .when
[13:08:22] <Eviltwin> No, I think the jQuery behavior is questionable here
[13:08:36] <Eviltwin> The problem is the callback is getting fired once each element reaches the end state
[13:09:00] <Eviltwin> And for the ones that are already not visible, it's firing immediately
[13:09:07] <darrennnn> AHHHhhhhhhh
[13:09:21] <Eviltwin> By using the deferred, it waits for allof them
[13:09:44] <xec-> Eviltwin: nice!
[13:09:49] <Zzaichik> How's this     http://jsfiddle.net/ZjSH7/6/
[13:09:56] <SKOFF> someone knows any plugin to view a pdf in a browser?
[13:10:05] <xec-> Eviltwin: one thing though, if i click multiple links rapidly, they all show up
[13:10:10] <darrennnn> so could i have also used some way to check its visibility ... like an if statement, before firing the fade out on it and then the callback?
[13:10:49] <fulcan> can anyone help me? I can't figure out why lavalamp is causing my hyperlinks to fail??   http://jsfiddle.net/zUtMU/
[13:11:28] <Eviltwin> xec-: What would you want to happen?
[13:11:58] <Eviltwin> darrennnn: Maybe, it could be a little involved
[13:12:10] <xec-> Eviltwin: i'm guessing he only wants one at a time to be visible? correct me if i'm wrong darrennnn
[13:12:37] <Eviltwin> xec-: But if it's thin the process of hiding one / showing two and I click three
[13:12:38] <xec-> Eviltwin: i.e. only the last clicked link
[13:12:57] <velts> anyone know why document.getElementById('myID').click(); doesnt work in chrome?
[13:13:00] <darrennnn> thats the goal xec- but Eviltwin's example is still viable. it's a relatively simple ui, so i dont expect people to mash the shit out of it.
[13:13:08] <Zzaichik> darrennnn: It's getting over-complicated again.  http://jsfiddle.net/ZjSH7/9/
[13:13:19] <Eviltwin> It's pretty easy to make it ignore clicks while animating
[13:13:56] <darrennnn> pretty slick Zzaichik
[13:14:15] <darrennnn> okay at the end of the day i think you've all given me insight into this

[13:14:21] <darrennnn> i can probably take it from here and make a decision
[13:14:48] <Eviltwin> Zzaichik: Don't use a .delay to try to coordinate things like that
[13:15:23] <xec-> heheh, he slapped a .stop() on my ugly hacked version :D
[13:15:31] <Zzaichik> yep. hha
[13:15:42] <xec-> high five Zzaichik
[13:16:29] <darrennnn> lol.
[13:16:45] <darrennnn> allright well, thanks again. im gonna spend some more time in the docs figuring out wtf you guys did.
[13:16:52] <darrennnn> definitely appreciate the help.
[13:20:11] <fulcan> can anyone help me? I can't figure out why lavalamp is causing my hyperlinks to fail??   http://jsfiddle.net/zUtMU/
[13:20:44] <xec-> holy mother of fiddles
[13:21:43] <fulcan> wow, I feel like my question has leprocy......  Not much support on the jquery support channel...?
[13:22:05] <xec-> the css field resembles some sort of contemporary art
[13:22:07] <sphinxxx> is there any way to detect once images have loaded, without using window.load ?
[13:22:27] <NoiseEee> fulcan: whatever "lavalamp" is, you should either inquire with their support, or visit http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[13:22:41] <Zzaichik> lol - fulcan lavalamp isn't being called in jsfiddle.
[13:22:50] <NoiseEee> fulcan: or make a *reduced* case in jsfiddle
[13:22:52] <kborchers> fulcan: the point of jsfiddle is to have a working example that shows the issue, not just a bunch of code pasted somewhere that doesn't work
[13:23:02] <fulcan> NoiseEee already been through the slide show, nothing there even comes close. no errors.....
[13:23:08] <xec-> fulcan: note the "working" part
[13:24:03] <elux> hey guys
[13:24:07] <Zzaichik> I have to admit, I pulled it up in jsfiddle. Looked at it for about 2 seconds (if that) and closed it.
[13:24:36] <xec-> Zzaichik: i'm still staring at it, it's like a car crash - can't look away
[13:24:38] <fulcan> NoiseEee if I remove lavalamp, she works. Add her back to the div and the links die. I stripped down my .css a lot and can find a conflict..  :(
[13:24:46] <NoiseEee> fulcan: the more code you present strangers, the less they're likely to want to go through it and pick it apart
[13:24:49] <monk12> hello all, i want to do some progressive de-hancement for a DOB text input hehe... it uses jquery datepicker and altField/altFormat options so the data can go into a hidden form field that has date in a format the client-side validation/server validation likes when the user picks date from popup...
[13:25:03] <monk12> but if i disabled javascript, then the hidden field is blank even if they typed into the regular textfield.
[13:25:05] <fulcan> NoiseEee understood..
[13:25:06] <Zzaichik> hhaha
[13:25:24] <NoiseEee> fulcan: links die mean what?  they don't go anywhere?  they're unclickable?  is it a CSS issue?
[13:25:28] <elux> im trying to register a "scroll" event handler on $(window) .. for infinite scroll stuff... but when changing state, id also like to turn it off.. ie.  $(window).on("scroll", function() { console.log(scroll); });  .. how can i then do $(window).off("scroll") .. but, say there are multiple handlers on $(window) .. off() will unbind all of them.. how can i target to a specific handler
[13:26:37] <monk12> i thought about a <noscript></noscript> to only show that hidden input... but then seems ghetto to do a <script>document.write('<input text.../><input hidden.../>');</script> before it.
[13:27:18] <fulcan> NoiseEee without the jquery script binded to the div (no jquery), the links work fine. when I add the class back to <div>, I can not longer 'click' to goto new page. Only 'right click -> new tab/window' works. about useless.
[13:29:50] <fulcan> NoiseEee any thoughts? I am new to jquery so expect the stoopid. Just stuck....
[13:30:14] <chovy> elux: https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/jquery-patterns/window-scroll-event.html
[13:31:22] <NoiseEee> fulcan: it's the "return false;"
[13:31:38] <Zzaichik> lavalamp seems interesting.  fulcan this line isn't any good.  var sictranslate = "translate("+left+"px, 0px)";
[13:31:43] <NoiseEee> fulcan: http://jsfiddle.net/zUtMU/1/
[13:31:55] <NoiseEee> i've made it link to both jquery and your lavalamp.js
[13:31:56] <Know1edge> Anyone have a list of sites to submit your pligin to?
[13:32:00] <Know1edge> plugin*
[13:32:25] <Zzaichik> So I'm guessing there's a bunch of bugs.
[13:33:43] <fulcan> NoiseEee return false in the lavalamp script?
[13:33:55] <NoiseEee> in your script... near the bottom.  i've commented it out.
[13:34:02] <NoiseEee> and voila, links go where they should
[13:37:40] <fulcan> NoiseEee omg thank you! I would have never of found that. I downloaded that script and expected it to be somewhat 'prepackaged/functional' wasn't even looking there. Thank you SOOOOOOO much!!!  Hit the nail right on the head. I am curious why they would stop the return of a value there?
[13:38:20] <NoiseEee> maybe it was a demo or something, beats me.  anyways good luck
[13:38:46] <fulcan> NoiseEee your the man of the hour!!!!  Thank you!
[13:39:08] <NoiseEee> yr welcome
[13:39:12] <Eviltwin> Anyone seen Randall in the last few days?
[13:42:18] <Zzaichik> man, I dislike PHP
[13:42:51] <thang> right there with you bud
[13:42:59] * thang is debugging php right now
[13:43:08] <fulcan> Zzaichik why in the world would you possibly dislike php?
[13:43:20] <Eviltwin> A real back end is written in C
[13:43:46] <Chopps> hey guys, i have a lot of divs all with class .tab_content, and i have this jquery code $(".tab_content:first"), is there any way to get the id of the div from that?
[13:44:07] <fulcan> Eviltwin gross overkill for web though.
[13:44:14] <chovy> Chopps: .attr('id')
[13:44:31] <Chopps> awesome chovy, thank you :D
[13:44:55] <Eviltwin> fulcan: Depends on what you're doing
[13:45:07] <Zzaichik> thang: yeah me too, not my code either. PHP Spaghetti is awesome!
[13:45:37] <fulcan> Eviltwin telecomm is done is C or C++, everything else in the lightest scripting language you can get your hands on...
[13:46:06] <Eviltwin> Right...
[13:47:13] <|PiP|`> with respect to jquery selector optimization, is the fastest lookup using a straight up id?
[13:47:18] <Zzaichik> What's worse is it's a wordpress site. So it's super awesome
[13:47:34] <fulcan> Eviltwin and I am a biatch, I honestly feel as though comm drivers should be in ASM, I embrace c and c++
[13:47:34] <|PiP|`> like will $('#mytable') be faster than $('table#mytable')
[13:47:38] <elux> chovy: thanks.. however, that uses timers to test for the scroll event..? a bit weird..
[13:49:44] <Eviltwin> |PiP|`: Check out jsperf.com

[14:18:00] <red_square> it would be yes tfittsy

[14:18:44] <cameronz> WTF!!!... $(this).width(25); and the element in firefox ends up being 24.9667px . So I end up with the pixels being out

[14:21:03] <b0x> $(this).attr('width', '25px') ?
[14:21:31] <b0x> or.. $(this).css('width', '25px') ?
[14:22:38] <cameronz> b0x: yeah $(this).css('width', '25px') not working either
[14:23:59] <cameronz> and $(this).attr('width', '25px') not doing anything
[14:28:32] <cameronz> any other ideas?? I got it working in Chrome and IE8.. but firefox is screwing it up
[14:28:49] <iamcurio> have asked about this before but.. does anyone know a good content slider like this: http://www.gucci.com/uk/category/f/women_s_ready_to_wear#look3121lookA113 - i don't mind paying for a license or if anyone as already put something together like this

[14:35:37] <StubbornTurtle> What is the most widely used/accepted solution for classes in jQuery?
[14:35:55] <theBrettman> StubbornTurtle, widgets
[14:35:56] <StubbornTurtle> (been searching but it looks like everything with classes hasn't been touched in years)
[14:37:44] <StubbornTurtle> theBrettman: thanks
[14:37:54] <lenswipe> ery
[14:37:55] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/3YCu5/1/
[14:37:56] <lenswipe> hey guys
[14:38:00] <lenswipe> can someone take a look at that
[14:38:04] <lenswipe> its giving me DOM exception #8
[14:38:11] <lenswipe> and its not performing wrap();
[14:42:09] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/3YCu5/2/
[14:42:12] <lenswipe> thats the new link
[14:42:16] <lenswipe> can someone please help?
[14:43:26] <cameronz> yeah the problem is.. I set to 25px but firefox (and I am reading IE9) will render to partial pixels.. ie. 24.996px in my case... so then my cloned table header ends up not being aligned to the other table
[14:43:30] <cameronz> FFS!!!
[14:44:09] <someprimetime> how can i rewrite this: $container = $('#js-container'); to reference all <p> tags? like ($container + 'p') ?
[14:44:43] <cameronz> someprimetime: $container.find('p')
[14:44:49] <someprimetime> cameronz: thanks
[14:45:27] <StubbornTurtle> theBrettman: widgets are not a very pretty way to make classes :/
[14:45:32] <lenswipe> cameronz, someprimetime welcome to #jquery - the channel where nobody gives a thundering fuck
[14:45:33] <lenswipe> >: {
[14:46:56] <someprimetime> lenswipe: you are using jquery 1.3.2
[14:47:03] <someprimetime> ?wrap @ lenswipe
[14:47:04] <bot-t> lenswipe, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[14:47:08] <someprimetime> go there
[14:47:12] <someprimetime> you are also referencing this inside of it
[14:47:15] <lenswipe> someprimetime, yes
[14:47:19] <someprimetime> which doesn't come about until wrap's 1.4 version of it
[14:47:27] <lenswipe> perhaps its 1.4 the
[14:47:29] <lenswipe> then*
[14:47:34] <someprimetime> i think so
[14:47:36] <lenswipe> wrap() existed about 30 seconds ago
[14:47:42] <someprimetime> i had the same issue with an old method of is
[14:47:57] <someprimetime> err trying to use is with an older version of jquery
[14:48:17] <chovy> lenswipehttp://jsfiddle.net/ZM9nD/1/
[14:48:18] <lenswipe> hmm

[14:48:43] <lenswipe> ChoiZ_, what is it?
[14:49:02] <someprimetime> he is referencing the index instead of using this it looks like
[14:49:27] <lenswipe> ah
[14:49:45] <cameronz> okay.. but what the hell.. if u set something to 25px.. it should render at 25px.. not 24.996px
[14:50:13] <lenswipe> chovy, so it works on jsfiddle
[14:50:17] <lenswipe> nothing on my wepage though :(
[14:50:34] <lenswipe> chovy, http://rmain.comp-degree.uhi.ac.uk/tasks/view/53.html

[14:52:41] <Bankzilla> kyb
[14:52:51] <Zzaichik> lenswipe: 'this' is still references the Window, not img

[14:52:57] <someprimetime> kyb: alert(window.location + '?pg=2');
[14:53:15] <someprimetime> but yeah do what Bankzilla says
[14:53:17] <Zzaichik> try this: http://jsfiddle.net/3YCu5/3/
[14:53:18] <chovy> lenswipe: can you do a simple $(document).ready(alert('foo')); to see if it's even getting ran?

[14:53:42] <StubbornTurtle> does anyone use Digg's class system? (http://code.google.com/p/digg/wiki/Class) … or is it outdated?

[14:54:13] <lenswipe> chovy, it just didnt uplod thats all :p
[14:54:35] <chovy> i saw it.
[14:54:38] <chovy> what was missing?
[14:54:55] <someprimetime> classes in js are kind of convoluted
[14:55:09] <someprimetime> it's not really an OOP based language
[14:55:12] <lenswipe> chovy, netbeans didnt sync back with the server :p
[14:56:49] <Petoj> Hi im trying to create a WP7 like animation with Jquery http://jsfiddle.net/eYzZB/ how can i stop it from stopping totally in the middle?
[14:56:59] <StubbornTurtle> someprimetime: what if you have a crew that likes to use it in OOP style though?
[14:57:34] <Petoj> i want it to slow down but not stop...
[14:57:35] <someprimetime> StubbornTurtle: it's personal preference but i don't like to force a convention on a language that wasn't designed around it
[14:58:14] <StubbornTurtle> someprimetime: moo tools uses it in a native sort of style though
[14:58:22] <StubbornTurtle> someprimetime: I feel like it has a place in javascript
[14:58:36] <KWhat_Work> Why would .show() work but .fadeIn or fadeToggle Fail
[15:00:01] <ProLoser|Work> Petoj: don't use 2 animations
[15:00:52] <Petoj> what easing function should i use then to get a slow down in the middle?
[15:01:30] <ProLoser|Work> iunno
[15:01:32] <ProLoser|Work> google
[15:01:39] <ProLoser|Work> there's ease function generators and crap like that
[15:02:08] <ProLoser|Work> easeInOut i think?
[15:03:30] <KWhat_Work> ehhh these effects functions are garbage
[15:05:47] <darrennnn> wha?
[15:05:59] <Petoj> ProLoser|Work: the easeInOut did the opposite of what i wanted :P now its slow at the edges :P http://jsfiddle.net/b6L8M/1/ tried easeOutIn but that didnt work :(
[15:06:46] <Shai-Tan> I have some jquery UI nested tabs. One set of nested tabs works fine, the other set has the same code, yet the tabs do not appear, just the unstyled content

[15:07:06] <darrennnn> does the page validate?
[15:07:15] <Shai-Tan> darrennnn: yes
[15:13:09] <Shai-Tan> oh, this is lovely, if I copy and past the source into a single file it works fine ...

[15:22:14] <wiwillia> Hi
[15:22:44] <wiwillia> Quick question for people: what should the following mean  $("#shirt-preview-art div")[0]
[15:23:27] <rylanb> first instance of div in that id container
[15:23:40] <rylanb> of A div
[15:24:14] <rylanb> that's my guess
[15:24:31] <wiwillia> @rylanb: thanks, that's what we were thinking too
[15:24:53] <ravenzz> i don't think so
[15:25:13] <rylanb> i just tested it and it returned me the first div in the body
[15:25:25] <whoever> hi all, I have a button appended to a div, button but when click() , change div text the button disappears, how ever if I append the button to an element that the text doesn't change the button does not disappear. can someone assist. it seems stange that click "#elem".text() would make the button that is appended to it disappear , I have also tried appending the button to the string after text change with no luck
[15:26:43] <ravenzz> wiwillia ID are unique, $('#foo') will select the element which has that id, and basically there should be just one with that id so [0] it the element itself
[15:27:13] <ravenzz> s/it/is
[15:27:15] <wiwillia> but the div selector after the #id
[15:27:22] <wiwillia> won't that return all divs inside the id?
[15:27:40] <rylanb> yes it will
[15:27:41] <ravenzz> wiwillia see it yourself http://jsfiddle.net/yzzkH/
[15:27:57] <rylanb> i think ravenzz is not seeing that div selector in the id
[15:28:12] <ravenzz> it select the #foo element, then you are able to access its children
[15:28:24] <ravenzz> oh lol
[15:28:25] <ravenzz> man
[15:28:39] <ravenzz> I am not
[15:28:40] <ravenzz> sorry
[15:29:30] <wiwillia> no proble
[15:29:31] <wiwillia> m
[15:29:48] <ravenzz> need to sleep :p
[15:29:51] <wiwillia> we were trying to figure out if it was selecting the first <div> in the #id, or selecting the first child in the div
[15:29:56] <nFFF> jQuery('.lightbox').click(function(){ jQuery(this).removeClass('lightbox'); }); -> anything inherently wrong with this if the html is <span class="lightbox"></span>
[15:30:41] <ravenzz> the first div of course
[15:31:14] <Phoenixz> Could I (using jQuery) from my own domain access this URL (example) http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/d-fjUMbSiHg, traverse the XML tree, and obtain the video title?
[15:31:42] <ravenzz> wiwillia but you probably want to use the first-child or first selector
[15:32:16] <rylanb> unless he want the first div, cuz it'll skip non div elements
[15:33:01] <nFFF> Anyone?
[15:33:38] <wiwillia> "the first div child of #id" is what we're looking for
[15:34:01] <wiwillia> (it's breaking in the context of a larger program we're trying to debug. We're trying to make sure all the pieces are doing what we think they are)
[15:34:07] <wiwillia> (Also, IE8.)
[15:34:58] <ravenzz> Phoenixz sure you can
[15:35:04] <moesti> hi, can anyone say me how i can access the id="test" in this iframe? http://jsfiddle.net/NAbDE/
[15:35:36] <ravenzz> Phoenixz but you'd need to use the jsonp ones
[15:36:07] <nFFF> moesti, jQuery('#test') ?
[15:36:26] <nFFF> You can only have one id
[15:36:50] <ravenzz> Phoenixz http://code.google.com/intl/it-IT/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_json.html
[15:36:53] <nFFF> Try class = "progressiFrame test"
[15:37:13] <nFFF> then just use standard selector jQuery('.test')

[15:46:22] <pifantastic> heshanh: yeah, I think so
[15:46:37] <pifantastic> heshanh: It has to add styles with javascript after you call .tabs()
[15:46:50] <heshanh> ah! select
[15:46:56] <heshanh> i was trying .focus
[15:46:57] <nFFF> moesti, $("#progressiFrame").contents().find("#test");
[15:47:28] <moesti> this is what i tried before
[15:47:34] <moesti> but maybe this helps
[15:47:38] <moesti> $('iframe').ready(function() {

[15:49:00] <muzone> Hello
[15:49:43] <muzone> Is there a way to make the appearance of #main-menu when hovering the orange field in http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/40/ a bit nicer? I'm using slideDown but it seems a bit odd and unnatural.
[15:50:26] <ravenzz> Phoenixz I should have a proof of concept somewhere, but i have to go..I am so sleepy. I'll be back in 10 hours or so ;)
[15:51:15] <ravenzz> anyway they have examples and a good documenation
[15:51:26] <muzone> sleep well ravenzz :-)
[15:51:29] <ravenzz> ty
[15:51:36] <ravenzz> night all
[15:53:58] <nFFF> Can anyone think of any easy way to load osme html to the current page using jQuery
[15:57:24] <whoever> I have a button that is dynamicly added to my page but when I change text  the button disappears , can some one assist
[16:01:06] <muzone> What's wrong with animate() at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/41/ - #main-menu should appear when one hovers that big orange field.
[16:01:09] <muzone> I previously had slideDown / slideUp, but I didn't like it.
[16:06:33] <MariusKarthaus> hi, i've created a widget using the factory  $.widget('myNamespace.Editor',{});  . Lets say I want to keep this widget intact but extend it with additional/overriding functions by loading another script (depending on page/settings etc) How would I do that?  I do not want inherritance, but override.
[16:06:58] <MariusKarthaus> should I just modify the prototype or does the factory have a better way of doing this?
[16:12:09] <MariusKarthaus> Ah never mind I found it, seems its perfectly legal to create the same-name widget again, extending the original.
[16:12:39] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/41/ - can someone recommend a better transition for #main-menu?
[16:13:32] <Zzaichik> At long last I can go back to doing what I love, not PHP.
[16:15:31] <jeffreylevesque> how do i replace the text inside an element
[16:16:00] <nFFF> .text().replace(); ?
[16:16:13] <jeffreylevesque> <a>stuff</a> to <a><img></a>
[16:16:59] <muzone> yo Vaerros!
[16:17:02] <muzone> got a sec?
[16:18:14] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque, can use $('a').append('<img>')
[16:18:56] <jeffreylevesque> i don't want to append
[16:19:00] <jeffreylevesque> i want to replace
[16:19:14] <muzone> nFFF: dont force append on him!
[16:19:40] <jeffreylevesque> lol
[16:20:03] <sphinxxx> then replace
[16:20:07] <nFFF> Well use $('a').replaceWith()?
[16:20:14] <jeffreylevesque> I'll try .text().replace()
[16:20:19] <sphinxxx> replaceWith
[16:20:26] <muzone> hey at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/41/ - can someone recommend a better transition for #main-menu?
[16:20:39] <jeffreylevesque> nFFF++
[16:20:46] <jeffreylevesque> sphinxxx++
[16:20:48] <jeffreylevesque> i'll try
[16:26:08] <moldy> hi
[16:26:34] <moldy> i'd like to trigger an event on an <input type="file"> if another element is clicked. is this possible using jquery?
[16:27:04] <sphinxxx> yea
[16:27:06] <sphinxxx> .click
[16:28:11] <nFFF> muzone
[16:28:12] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/WHxhx/43/
[16:28:21] <moldy> sphinxxx: seems to do nothing. maybe i am missing something obvious. i remember reading once that file inputs are special.
[16:28:40] <sphinxxx> moldy make a jsfiddle and ill look at it
[16:28:48] <nFFF> ^^
[16:29:06] <Eviltwin> muzone: How're those funds coming?
[16:29:11] <jeffreylevesque> this is my code: $('.flag-cart .flag-wrapper a').text().replace('<img src="/sites/images/layout/cartButton.png" />');
[16:29:15] <moldy> sphinxxx: ok, thanks in advance... 2 minutes
[16:29:19] <jeffreylevesque> if my site is ebay.com
[16:29:36] <muzone> Eviltwin: getting them on the 1st
[16:29:48] <jeffreylevesque> is the image going to display correctly?
[16:29:54] <nFFF> muzone, is that what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/WHxhx/43/
[16:30:10] <muzone> nFFF: thanks but the transition is still the same right?
[16:30:11] <jeffreylevesque> if 'sites' is an immediate directory in my public_html?
[16:30:13] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque, try it?
[16:30:26] <jeffreylevesque> yea i did
[16:30:26] <moldy> sphinxxx: i never used jsfiffle before. do i need to include jquery somehow?
[16:30:33] <jeffreylevesque> nFFF: didn't work
[16:30:47] <jeffreylevesque> in php i have to refer to the domain
[16:30:51] <red_square> moldy you cant trigger a file input x-browser
[16:31:05] <jeffreylevesque> [site domain] . '/images....'
[16:31:10] <jeffreylevesque> something like that
[16:31:15] <krz> anyone know  a good upload script? i need a script to upload directly to s3
[16:31:23] <krz> even if its paid. i will pay for it
[16:31:25] <muzone> nFFF: you just reorganized the code right?
[16:31:27] <moldy> red_square: that's what i had in mind :( anyway, thanks for confirming it
[16:31:46] <jeffreylevesque> nFFF: in jquery is it good enough to do '/sites...'
[16:31:51] <nFFF> Yea, well the jsfiddle you uploaded didn't work
[16:32:01] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque, that's nothing to do with jQuery
[16:32:09] <moldy> i guess i will just forget about it :)
[16:32:09] <nFFF> Your problem lies in your html
[16:32:24] <muzone> fuck sorry
[16:32:29] <muzone> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/44/
[16:32:58] <nFFF> muzone, yea our effects are similiar
[16:33:24] <jeffreylevesque> ok?
[16:33:24] <muzone> are there any neater effects out there though?
[16:33:28] <jeffreylevesque> i know this
[16:33:35] <muzone> maybe http://api.jquery.com/animate/?
[16:33:35] <jeffreylevesque> im asking what the syntax is
[16:33:40] <nFFF> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:33:52] <nFFF> Yea, use a custom CSS animation if you prefer
[16:34:01] <nFFF> However complex you feel like going
[16:34:15] <nFFF> Im sure there'll be ones out for bounce, elastic effects etc
[16:34:21] <nFFF> you can copy therre code
[16:34:30] <muzone> nFFF: just want something quick and snappy
[16:34:42] <muzone> nFFF: i tried replacing slideDown() with animate() - is that not the right way?
[16:34:42] <moldy> red_square, sphinxxx: this actually seems to work in jsfiddle in at least ff & chromium: http://jsfiddle.net/jsRBV/1/
[16:36:04] <nFFF> muzone, it's really your own taste :) just google different effects 'jquery animate() bounce'
[16:36:31] <red_square> moldy works in ie9 also, even in ie7 mode. Maybe it was 6 that failed
[16:36:47] <nFFF> muzone, animate executes custom css on the element
[16:36:52] <nFFF> so how are you using it?
[16:36:55] <red_square> or maybe I was thinking of styling it
[16:38:03] <moldy> red_square: cool :)
[16:39:08] <moldy> red_square: now i just need to find out why it doesn't work on my other side :)
[16:40:19] <muzone> nFFF: ah that makes sense
[16:41:04] <aaairc> can you do "+=" to append to a String var?
[16:41:26] <Eviltwin> Yes
[16:42:22] <muzone> nFFF: any idea why the slideDown is like two-phased?
[16:42:25] <aaairc> thx
[16:42:32] <muzone> seems first one part slides in then the 2nd at the top
[16:44:01] <red_square> padding, margin on an element
[16:45:42] <nFFF> muzone where?
[16:46:12] <muzone> http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/44/
[16:46:26] <muzone> same ol
[16:48:14] <nFFF> Thats just how it animates it
[16:48:19] <nFFF> I've seen that before
[16:48:26] <nFFF> Don't think there's anyting you cand o about it
[16:49:07] <muzone> damn..
[16:49:07] <nFFF> muzone, google 'jquery slidedown jumpy'
[16:49:13] <nFFF> theres some people with fixes
[16:49:16] <muzone> thanks!

[17:17:22] <bonhoffer> is there a way to do alert(my_var.inspect)?
[17:18:31] <bonhoffer> what i really want to do is troubleshoot why my calendar isn't running
[17:18:49] <bonhoffer> it was on one page, but not on this one -- and there is no console error
[17:19:09] <aitiba> hi
[17:19:49] <bonhoffer> hasDatepicker is loaded as the class but datepicker isn't showing
[17:22:17] <netxshare> anyone know anything about highcharts?
[17:23:58] <muzone> netxshare: im a fan
[17:24:05] <muzone> and of gRaphael
[17:24:09] <\monster\> hey guys, I want to do some parsing of a remote page using jquery ..is it possible to load an entire page into a jquery object on which I can then do work?
[17:24:28] <\monster\> .load() seems to just load html onto the page
[17:24:33] <netxshare> muzone: I can't not seem to get the z-index of the tooltip to work
[17:24:35] <muzone> gRphl
[17:24:57] <muzone> i dont know about that netxshare
[17:25:06] <netxshare> it does this
[17:25:07] <netxshare> http://gyazo.com/8564d3efab8619ae18386a11a323b177
[17:25:25] <bsmirnov> what is the best way to select a subset of matched elements based on a numeric array lie [1,3,4,5,8]
[17:26:27] <muzone> yeah, i dont know
[17:26:31] <netxshare> alright
[17:26:33] <netxshare> thanks tho
[17:26:38] <muzone> i'd use http://g.raphael.com with jquery ui tooltip
[17:27:08] <muzone> http://g.raphaeljs.com/
[17:27:30] <bsmirnov> so if I have $("#somelist li") i want to select the items that match the values the array. like eq() but multiple esentially.

[17:43:39] <bonhoffer> how i can really "get" the timelines that go on with jquery -- DOM syncronous, asyncronous, dynamic DOM, etc
[17:43:51] <bonhoffer> and can, say, chrome developer tools help me?
[17:44:29] <muzone> yeah it will help you :)
[17:44:40] <bonhoffer> thanks
[17:49:14] <Eviltwin> bonhoffer: How can you "get" it?
[17:49:22] <Eviltwin> You mean what function is being run when?
[17:50:36] <bonhoffer> Eviltwin, I just need to learn

[17:50:50] <bonhoffer> excellent!
[17:50:54] <saddishwasher> hey all, what would be a good channel to talk about jqTouch and mobile app dev?
[17:51:29] <bonhoffer> Eviltwin, in my case there is no error but my datepicker is not loading because the hasDatepicker class
[17:51:49] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ bonhoffer
[17:51:50] <bot-t> bonhoffer, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:52:29] <bonhoffer> Eviltwin, I would -- the demo works great -- the problem is that when i load my <div > from within a database, the code doesn't run
[17:52:54] <bonhoffer> i'll look through the guide -- oh I see it -- bad class i'm adding hasDatepicker
[17:53:09] <bonhoffer> pasted code . . . my bad -- thanks -- but i'll read that guide -- i want to get smart on this
[17:53:15] <bonhoffer> Thanks for the link
[18:09:38] <bonhoffer> Eviltwin, is there a way to do alert(foo.inspect);
[18:10:51] <Eviltwin> Uh...what?
[18:17:57] <pifantastic> bonhoffer: I believe you want console.log()
[18:18:04] <pifantastic> it will display the full structure of foo
[18:18:16] <bonhoffer> excellent
[18:18:19] <pifantastic> assuming you are using Chrom/Webkit Inspector or Firebug
[18:18:25] <bonhoffer> console.log(foo)
[18:18:29] <bonhoffer> i'll try it
[18:18:32] <pifantastic> yes
[18:18:37] <tw2113> and if you'ren ot using one of those, what are you doing with jquery
[18:18:40] <pifantastic> bonhoffer: but you will need to be familiar with the console
[18:18:50] <pifantastic> tw2113: you'd be suprised!
[18:18:51] <tw2113> you're not*
[18:19:07] <tw2113> true, they could be one of the few opera users
[18:19:11] <bonhoffer> i love the console for troubleshooting
[18:19:16] <tw2113> even though that has it's own inspector
[18:20:50] <pifantastic> bonhoffer: then why were you asking about alert?
[18:21:53] <bonhoffer> because i use the console to play with jquery, but i had been using alert to show values :)
[18:22:00] <pifantastic> ahh
[18:22:01] <pifantastic> well
[18:22:06] <pifantastic> welcome to a whole new world
[18:22:08] <bonhoffer> so i definitely need to be more familiar with the console

[18:22:28] <pifantastic> and that is a great read ^
[18:22:54] <pifantastic> because chrome will let you set breakpoints, WOW!
[18:22:56] <pifantastic> which means
[18:23:00] * tw2113 loads them up
[18:23:06] <tw2113> i need to work on my js-fu
[18:23:07] <pifantastic> you dont have to sprinkle console.log('wtf')'s all over the place
[18:24:02] <tw2113> i tend to add as needed then remove
[18:24:07] <b0x> R U Steppin To Me Bro?
[18:26:34] <tw2113> even opera's inspector is pretty impressive in its own ways
[18:26:53] <pifantastic> yep
[18:26:55] <pifantastic> absolutely
[18:28:05] <tw2113> it also shows storage stuff
[18:28:28] <pifantastic> as do Firebug and Inspector
[18:29:04] <tw2113> not finding that in firebug
[18:30:32] <pifantastic> tw2113: it's there, just harder to find :)
[18:30:48] <tw2113> don't tell me

[18:56:00] <tash> can someone tell me how to overwrite what is in a table? so, table id is "blah" ... should I destroy "blah" and then .html it? or does destroying it actually remove it entirely from the page, thus making the .html impossible?
[18:56:15] <tash> I want to completely re-write the table essentially

[20:04:29] <imsky> abjorn we fight
[20:04:36] <imsky> together
[20:04:38] <imsky> as one
[20:04:41] <kborchers> someprimetime: a couple of things. console.log() will break IE unless you have developer tools open. and you should use .length instead of .size() to avoid the unnecessary function call
[20:04:44] <imsky> ?deferred
[20:04:44] <bot-t> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[20:04:48] <imsky> as a deferred object
[20:05:30] <someprimetime> kborchers: good idea on the length, but even w/o console.log it'll not work in IE for some reason
[20:05:56] <kborchers> someprimetime: not work meaning what?
[20:06:35] <someprimetime> kborchers: it should be hiding everything except the first paragraph
[20:06:40] <someprimetime> works in chrome/ff/etc
[20:06:47] <kborchers> works for me in IE9
[20:08:08] <someprimetime> what about IE8? maybe it's this laptop
[20:22:19] <progrock`> weird, getting different results in chrome than ff (ff does what I hoped) with:  if ((newselect = selected.prev(':not(.padTop')).length)
[20:22:49] <progrock`> the ':not(.padTop)'  is whats not working in chrome, but does in FF
[20:24:55] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/53/ - what's with the {"error": "Please use POST request"} syntax error (line 50)?

[20:31:30] <progrock`> muzone: whats with the hover intent?
[20:31:32] <progrock`> why not hover?
[20:32:57] <muzone> well, hoverintent tries to be more accessible i think
[20:33:32] <muzone> like pausing for a bit incase the user accidentally moved the mouse
[20:33:51] <muzone> * moves
[20:34:54] <heshanh> danny!
[20:35:59] <muzone> no shit that danny??

[20:38:15] <progrock`> well, at least .not(...) worked.. weird
[20:38:41] <abjorn> They were under the impression I had more "experience" (as in, working for actual companies, not freelance) and felt I needed more before I'd be "a good fit."
[20:38:53] <imsky> hnnggg
[20:39:05] <imsky> 7 years at hostgator: all the experience you need
[20:39:10] <abjorn> lol
[20:40:15] <imsky> oh well buddy, keep on trucking
[20:40:20] <imsky> you'll still be a dev in like a week
[20:40:29] <imsky> right in time for superbowl xlvi
[20:40:29] <abjorn> yeah, I'm not broken up about it lol
[20:40:34] <abjorn> after all, they approached me
[20:40:50] <abjorn> lol

[20:44:58] <abjorn> :o
[20:45:23] <imsky> wish i had superbowl tickets
[20:47:15] <imsky> good seats are like $9200
[20:47:23] <imsky> i think i'm in the wrong business
[20:47:40] <imsky> build my own goddamn stadium, charge people a used car to sit in it
[20:52:22] <imsky> 2006 cadillac dts v8: $7000
[20:52:26] <imsky> no justice in this world
[20:54:52] <heshanh> 9200? for a ticket?
[20:54:53] <heshanh> wtf
[20:54:59] <progrock`> man, I am surprised, for the first time, an extermely heavy in JS (lots of juery use) UI I built is MUCH faster in firefox than chrome
[20:55:03] <imsky> yeah, midfield tickets are $17000, heshanh
[20:55:11] <imsky> 9200 is like good seats
[20:55:19] <imsky> 17000 is great seats
[20:55:34] <heshanh> thats messed up, and its game that only americans play too
[20:55:41] <imsky> lol
[20:55:53] <imsky> the cheapest seats are $2950
[20:56:11] <imsky> which would you rather have, a new laptop, a new computer, new speakers, new monitor, new gpu, OR
[20:56:14] <heshanh> i mean i can justify 600-1000 for the rugby world cup. but this!
[20:56:16] <imsky> the worst seat in the stadium
[20:56:30] <heshanh> ill take all taht money to the a strip club!
[20:56:35] <imsky> haha good man
[20:56:38] <progrock`> buy ticekts the last week if you can, will be cheaper
[20:56:39] <imsky> BUSINESS CAN WAIT
[20:56:45] <imsky> progrock`: inorite
[20:56:45] <heshanh> get boobies all over my face all night!
[20:56:45] <progrock`> i mean the last couple of days
[20:57:21] <imsky> the price is like (1/(days left/365))*100
[20:57:56] <heshanh> so if u buy it when the last game finishes
[20:57:59] <heshanh> its the cheapest
[20:58:06] <imsky> hmm no
[20:58:19] <heshanh> ha! and u wait 6 months and put it on CL and make a profit
[20:58:23] <imsky> lol
[20:58:25] <imsky> yes actually
[20:58:27] <imsky> hence scalpers
[20:58:39] <heshanh> fuk this web dev business. im going into that
[20:58:41] * imsky plans next year's business strategy
[20:58:45] <imsky> i know right
[20:58:57] <imsky> make an easy 80% margin over and over again
[20:59:04] <heshanh> u do the buying ill find ppl to sell and we go 50-50?
[20:59:13] <imsky> depends on where you live
[20:59:20] <imsky> and where next year's superbowl will be
[20:59:22] <heshanh> too far lol. melbourne
[20:59:26] <imsky> oh wait i know, new orleans
[20:59:31] <imsky> yeah bud, you fly out here
[20:59:35] <imsky> one ticket will cover your flying
[20:59:48] <heshanh> haha yeah, for that sorta money, why the hell not :D
[20:59:57] <imsky> wait let me blow your mind
[21:00:04] <imsky> 1 sec
[21:00:59] <imsky> ok here we go
[21:01:07] <heshanh> alright, lets hear this
[21:01:46] <imsky> wait wait one sec
[21:02:00] <imsky> i'm making it even more mindblowing
[21:02:01] <imsky> ok
[21:02:18] <imsky> here's a flight from melbourne to indianapolis, roundtrip
[21:02:23] <heshanh> uve no idea how glad i am that u said 'mind'
[21:02:26] <imsky> 2 stops, 28 hours, first class the whole way through
[21:02:32] <imsky> $22,733
[21:02:42] <imsky> only $2k more expensive than the most expensive seat in that stadium
[21:02:51] <heshanh> god damnit
[21:03:02] <heshanh> leme call my travel agent
[21:03:11] <imsky> i'm on the phone right now with that douchebag
[21:03:17] <heshanh> lol
[21:03:28] <imsky> and you get layovers in LA and chicago
[21:03:29] <imsky> lucky you
[21:03:40] <imsky> so to sum up
[21:03:43] <progrock`> anyone know of any good progressive load examples (the dumb beyond simple one is how facebook loads more content as you get to the bottom)... I working on a much more advanced version for a table of 10k+ rows
[21:03:48] <heshanh> i love getting layovers
[21:04:09] <imsky> superbowl game: around 5 hours total including festivities
[21:04:14] <heshanh> gmm scroll position + ajax
[21:04:15] <imsky> your insanely great flight: 28 hours
[21:04:25] <imsky> superbowl: $4000/hour
[21:04:33] <progrock`> heshanh: I'm going much crazier
[21:04:35] <imsky> flight: $785/hour
[21:05:05] <heshanh> lol
[21:05:26] <progrock`> heshanh: in order to have the scroll bar not jump when it loads, when theres 300-100 rows left, I add padding bit by bit to the bottom, then when 100 left I make the jajax request, add the rows, reduce the padding
[21:05:27] <heshanh> far out, u werent kidding
[21:05:28] <imsky> when you think about it
[21:05:37] <imsky> a flight is so incredibly complicated
[21:05:38] <heshanh> its 20,077
[21:05:53] <imsky> there's jet fuel and high end technology, safety stuff, airports, energy, all that
[21:06:02] <imsky> superbowl is 20 dudes in tights with a ball and a big screen/lights
[21:06:14] <heshanh> cant u scroll the page when it finished loading?
[21:06:36] <heshanh> so i'll need what? close to 50g?
[21:06:48] <imsky> no no
[21:06:53] <imsky> 20k is roundtrip flight, roundtrip
[21:06:56] <imsky> so in effect, actually
[21:07:06] <imsky> that 785 comes down to $392/h
[21:07:29] <imsky> the superbowl is literally 10x more expensive than an urgent, first-class intercontinental flight
[21:07:31] <heshanh> how many tickerts do we have to sell to make all taht back
[21:07:37] <imsky> umm
[21:07:39] <imsky> let me see
[21:07:48] <heshanh> 14k if i go econ lol
[21:07:49] <imsky> i think the cost for a dece ticket in january was something like $1,500
[21:07:56] <imsky> now it's around $3k
[21:08:03] <imsky> big tickets probably have same markup
[21:08:13] <imsky> so 2 big tickets or 10 entry-level tickets
[21:08:41] <heshanh> and someone to buy it
[21:08:50] <imsky> there's always going to be somebody
[21:09:11] <heshanh> well... we just might have a plan
[21:09:17] <imsky> that's right bud
[21:09:26] <imsky> if you're up for it, see you next year in louisiana
[21:09:40] <heshanh> when is the superbowl
[21:09:44] <imsky> this year?
[21:09:48] <heshanh> yeah
[21:09:50] <heshanh> month
[21:09:52] <imsky> 2/5
[21:10:00] <imsky> just 9 days i think
[21:10:31] <heshanh> ah yeah. maybe, getting married in jan, fly straight to states
[21:10:31] <imsky> lol here's something else
[21:10:41] <imsky> halftime ad price is the highest it's ever been
[21:10:47] <imsky> $3,500,000 for a 30-sec commercial
[21:11:25] <imsky> so the game is $4000/hr, fair enough. but the commercial time is $420,000,000/hr
[21:11:34] <taipres> yeah that's crazy
[21:11:41] <imsky> it's more than 100,000x expensive than the game
[21:11:41] <taipres> even if I had a billion dollars
[21:11:46] <taipres> wouldn't advertise on there
[21:12:17] <heshanh> u know, no wonder the rest of us think that you lot is crazy!
[21:12:21] <imsky> lol
[21:12:32] <taipres> seriously
[21:12:43] <taipres> imagine that money spent on online advertising
[21:12:46] <imsky> assuming that the average ticket went for around $5k, last year's superbowl tickets cost $516M total
[21:12:55] <taipres> it'd be so much more effective it's mind numbing
[21:12:58] <heshanh> yah i'll crackup all my adword campaigns
[21:13:02] <imsky> lol
[21:13:07] <imsky> $2000 cpc
[21:13:07] <heshanh> ALWAYS first page bid
[21:13:16] <heshanh> no will be able to out bid my adds
[21:13:18] <heshanh> ads*
[21:14:18] <imsky> i wonder what else costs $0.4B/hr
[21:14:25] <imsky> not many things, i think
[21:14:57] <heshanh> cant think of anything
[21:15:12] <heshanh> time on ISS?
[21:15:21] <imsky> the american government costs around $0.7B/hr
[21:15:22] <heshanh> ticket on viginy galatic?
[21:15:25] <imsky> that's kinda interesting
[21:15:32] <heshanh> cost as in spend?
[21:15:35] <imsky> yeah
[21:15:46] <imsky> so superbowl has some ways to go
[21:15:47] <heshanh> im sure they cost alot cheaper... to hire..
[21:15:50] <imsky> lol
[21:16:24] <imsky> man 700 million an hour
[21:16:36] <imsky> ok maybe the us is a bad example
[21:16:47] <heshanh> alot of $
[21:17:00] <heshanh> wonder what i can do with tha much money
[21:17:41] <imsky> wow the uk is thrifty
[21:18:02] <imsky> it only costs $8M/hr to run the uk
[21:18:03] <imsky> wtf
[21:18:08] <imsky> that can't be right
[21:18:34] <heshanh> no wya
[21:18:39] <heshanh> thos guys are bankrupt
[21:18:52] <heshanh> so they are prob running on a low budget lol
[21:19:02] <imsky> no it's true
[21:19:04] <imsky> holy shit
[21:19:11] <imsky> ohhhh
[21:19:14] <imsky> no it's not true
[21:19:16] <imsky> one sec
[21:20:11] <imsky> lol?
[21:21:05] <heshanh> .8 ?
[21:21:12] <imsky> yeah i dunno, the site's being a dick
[21:21:19] <imsky> total public spending is apparently $691 trillion
[21:21:21] <imsky> i believe that
[21:21:35] <imsky> but total spending for fiscal 2013 is only 722 billion
[21:22:02] <heshanh> like i aid they running on a low budget
[21:22:03] <heshanh> lol
[21:22:08] <imsky> i guess you're right
[21:22:16] <imsky> apparently they run a hundred times leaner than the us goverment
[21:23:09] <heshanh> yeah, u guys are crazy
[21:24:39] <imsky> oh, the site's being a dick, it mixes up trillion and billion
[21:24:46] <imsky> makes sense now
[21:24:59] <imsky> fwiw, spending has been going way up for both US and UK since '02
[21:25:25] <imsky> abjorn: it costs $0.7 billion an hour for us to live here
[21:25:35] <imsky> pay your taxes i guess
[21:25:49] <abjorn> wat
[21:25:54] <imsky> yeah man wtf
[21:26:21] <imsky> that's like
[21:26:35] <imsky> to get mark zuckerberg's wealth, we just have to wait 18 hours
[21:27:06] <imsky> every day, 1.3 mark zuckerbergs get spent
[21:27:25] <heshanh> lol
[21:27:32] <heshanh> thats one way to put it
[21:27:50] <imsky> bill gates is 3 days
[21:27:53] <imsky> jesus
[21:45:09] <Symbolic> Nhelp
[21:45:26] <Symbolic> !help
[21:45:31] <imsky> wat
[21:45:51] <Symbolic> Ignore
[21:45:59] <imsky> wat
[21:47:21] <heshanh> 30 mins and im HOME!
[21:47:27] <heshanh> bring on the weekend
[21:47:38] <imsky> get to it buddy
[21:47:57] <heshanh> and yesterday was a day off too, australia day D
[21:48:08] <heshanh> so much beer, so very very much
[21:48:11] <imsky> lol you lazy bums
[21:48:40] <progrock`> damn it... still ned to fucking optimize this UI... by the time I'm done, nothign will take longer thana blink of an eye... minus some ajax requests... but if I do it right, the user will never have a clue they are even occurring
[21:48:45] <heshanh> lol u should see canbera, aus capital wehre all the politicians live. SO many public holidays
[21:48:53] <imsky> haha
[21:49:25] <heshanh> i was there on contact for abt 8 months, i think i ahd a totaly for 3-4 weeks worth of days off
[21:49:35] <imsky> lmao
[21:56:17] <progrock`> so, anyone have a preferred IDE for javascript, if so what?  (IDE, not text editor... long time VIM user... I'm considering VIM and the likes text editors)
[21:57:16] <Cork> i'm quite found of gedit and eclipse
[21:57:30] <heshanh> eclipse
[21:57:56] <progrock`> heshanh: I'm considering getting eclipse with eclim going
[21:58:02] <progrock`> heshanh: but I always seem to screw it up
[21:58:05] <heshanh> does all taht fancy smart view stuff for jquery
[21:58:19] <heshanh> hmm not srue mate im running it on windows
[21:58:51] <progrock`> oh, the only windows I have is XP in virtualbox at work
[21:59:01] <progrock`> jsut for photoshop and illustrator.. and browser tetsing
[21:59:14] <progrock`> definitely need a liux solution
[22:00:21] <progrock`> I use IDEA at work for scala.. with  vim keybindings.. but it kinda sucks.. screws up too often, etc
[22:01:06] <progrock`> but I have gotten to like a few things.. like ctrl click on functions brings you to where its defined.. even if in a different file.. jsut within the project
[22:01:07] <ngharo> what do you need from an IDE that you're not getting from vim?
[22:01:08] <heshanh> is there any js specific IDEs
[22:01:13] <progrock`> great for jumping into the jquery source quick
[22:01:13] <imsky> working with eclipse is like dancing with an elephant
[22:01:15] <imsky> no heshanh
[22:01:29] <imsky> how anyone can get work done in eclipse/netbeans is just a mystery to me
[22:01:31] <heshanh> oh dont be like that, it works nice on windows
[22:01:47] <progrock`> ngharo: not much... though the IDE is very useful for the scala code that I am far fom an expert on
[22:01:56] <heshanh> has all that svn/php mambojomb in it
[22:02:28] <progrock`> yeah, thats the other thing.. I am very familiar with git. but we're still using svn becuase our syste, admin has 5 millions htings on his table
[22:02:40] <progrock`> but git svn isnt horrible, ll
[22:05:31] <progrock`> now to figure out a good techniqu to have a separate vim config/plugins for eclim
[22:05:38] <chachan> hi guys, wondering how to get a list of values from input[type="file"]
[22:07:26] <progrock`> var values = $('input[type="file").map(function() { return $(this).val() })
[22:07:42] <progrock`> var values = $('input[type=file]').map(function() { return $(this).val() })
[22:08:12] <progrock`> chachan: check to see if that works, I think it should
[22:08:31] <progrock`> does .val() only give the first selectors value?  if not, maybe you ould jsut do that , lol
[22:09:46] <chachan> progrock`: it's only returning the first one
[22:10:04] <chachan> this is the HTML: <input type="file" name="files" multiple="multiple" accept="image/*" />
[22:10:38] <heshanh> im outa here, enjoy the weekend guys
[22:10:48] <imsky> later hesh
[22:11:23] <progrock`> chachan: my example should be guving you all
[22:11:27] <progrock`> is it not?
[22:11:56] <progrock`> the ssecond one of course, the first had syntax errors
[22:15:39] <chachan> progrock`: but it's returning only the first one
[22:16:42] <progrock`> chachan: its looping through ever one from the sleector and returnign a list of them... please post a jsfiddl example and Ill make sure it works
[22:16:54] <progrock`> make sure the selector is getting more than one
[22:17:41] <chachan> hm, if I want to upload several files, one input could be enough is I set the multiple parameter?
[22:17:58] <chachan> bc I'm using only one HTML object for it
[22:18:09] <chachan> but selecting more than one
[22:18:11] <progrock`> I think so.. havent fucked with file upload, though I will be soon... though I will be using html5 drag feature I hitnk
[22:18:30] <ilon_> html5 is the future they say
[22:18:45] <ilon_> i still have to mock around with local storage..
[22:19:21] <progrock`> ilon_: its pretty straight forward
[22:19:33] <progrock`> I think I have 4 notes that cover eveything i need to know with it, lol
[22:20:01] <ilon_> progrock`: html 5 in general? yes, i SHOULD be straight forward.
[22:20:22] <ilon_> progrock`: since it covers most use cases that have evolved since html4
[22:20:39] <progrock`> ilon_: local storage...
[22:21:43] <ilon_> progrock`: oh yeah, well, just have to try it, have an idea about how to use it :)
[22:23:06] <progrock`> now Im more interested in indexedDB... but of course fuckign apple is behind
[22:23:11] <progrock`> otherwise I;d be using it right now
[22:23:34] <progrock`> webkit spport it, but for some reason safarui and safari mobile dont
[22:27:22] <chachan> progrock`: http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/B5gV8
[22:27:57] <chachan> that should show in #values all the values, am I right?
[22:28:11] <chachan> works only returning the first value =/
[22:28:12] <progrock`> chachan: you have 1 input.. of course only 1 value comes back
[22:28:55] <chachan> progrock`: hm, what's the idea of using "multiple", I thought it creates and array into the DOM or something like that
[22:29:26] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/59/ - does anybody know why the grey field gets "thrown away" when you hover the orange field? Shouldn't it just slide down all naturally?
[22:29:29] * muzone is now playing: All Natural - 50 Years (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PViK8wTabhg)
[22:29:39] <chachan> then, I should have to add an input for any file that I want to upload, I guess I should set them the same name
[22:31:27] <progrock`> In the case of <select multiple="multiple"> elements, the .val() method
[22:31:30] <progrock`> weird
[22:32:41] <progrock`> oh thats select
[22:33:29] <progrock`> it should work, not sure... don thave time... i bet the answer is on stackoverflow
[22:33:55] <chachan> it's not working =/
[22:35:23] <progrock`> google will solve it im sure
[22:35:52] <progrock`> and if you dont need an array of the values, dont use map, use each.. but since you onl have on input.. you shouldnt need either
[22:36:41] <chachan> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6171013/javascript-get-number-of-files-and-their-filenames-from-input-multiple-elemen
[22:36:49] <chachan> FYI :)
[22:36:53] <chachan> progrock`: thanks
[22:52:55] <Wizek> Hi
[22:53:09] <Wizek> How can I dejqueryfy some source?
[22:54:04] <Wizek> So that it behaves quite the same, but it isn't dependent on jQuery
[22:55:29] <NiLon> um by rewriting it?
[22:56:43] <shesek> Wizek, you'll have to do it manually, no magical way or something
[22:56:43] <imsky> you can substitute zepto for jquery
[22:56:50] <shesek> why would you do it tho?
[22:56:53] <imsky> then it'll be dependent on zepto!
[22:58:01] <Wizek> I develop a library, and It's quite obscure that jquery is it's only dependency
[22:58:34] <imsky> Wizek: learn how to write standalone code
[22:58:59] <Wizek> imsky, I know how to do that, I just hoped it can be speeden up somehow
[22:59:07] <imsky> well yes
[22:59:25] <imsky> replace all jquery calls to your own little function
[22:59:29] <imsky> that does the same thing
[22:59:53] <shesek> Wizek, why is a jQuery dependency a bad thing?
[23:00:15] <Wizek> In my case it is
[23:01:29] <CodeZombie> how would one go about defining a selector that referenced multiple data attributes?
[23:01:34] <Wizek> I'd like to make my library stand alone. It's logo is already included with base64, css as one line of string, and the odd one out is jquery, which I could also concat into, but that would ~tripple my 30k library's size
[23:01:41] <CodeZombie> for example, my element has data-collect=1, and data-room=2
[23:01:46] <CodeZombie> I need to filter by both
[23:02:08] <khmer> Wizek: all you can do is refactor each method individually...there's no shortcut to this
[23:03:00] <shesek> CodeZombie, [data-foo=bar][data-baz=qux]
[23:03:12] <CodeZombie> hmmm, I thought I tried that, let me try again
[23:03:13] <CodeZombie> thanks shesek
[23:03:35] <CodeZombie> works, I suppose I botched it last time, thanks!
[23:03:41] <shesek> you welcome
[23:06:10] <Wizek> Sad to hear.
[23:06:16] <Wizek> Thanks anyways.
[23:06:59] <khmer> Wizek: you might be comforted to know that with the advent of popular CDNs like google's, most people's browsers have jquery well cached
[23:07:20] <khmer> Wizek: so if you source it from a CDN, it's likely they won't have to download it at all!
[23:09:09] <Wizek> I'm also reluctant to introduce a web-based dependenci as the lib is perfectly functionall (and still is useful) without a connection
[23:09:42] <khmer> well, no it isn't
[23:09:56] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/59/ - why does the grey field get "thrown forth and back" when you hover the orange field? Shouldn't it just slide down all naturally?
[23:10:39] <Wizek> khmer, What do you mean by that no?
[23:11:02] <khmer> Wizek: i'm joshing you. if it was functional without jquery, you wouldn't be asking how to decouple it
[23:11:13] <khmer> so don't count your chickens
[23:18:32] <progrock`> man I feel dumb, just tok me 30 minutes to create a fuckign project from an svn repo in eclipse
[23:19:02] <progrock`> I really would think a decent IDE woud let you open and root directory containing a git repo or svn ceckout, and 2 clicks good to go

[23:21:33] <chachan> any help with displaying thumbnails after selecting image files but before uploading them?
[23:41:59] <bestKoderEver> hey
[23:42:31] <bestKoderEver> whats the best way to run a method async from the client to a .net server? C#
[23:42:37] <bestKoderEver> .ajax??
[23:45:59] <mindis|wurk> anyone know a css trick for make a text input behave like divs for its width? i have a parent element with padding and i'd like the input to take as much as space as it can like a div but setting width to 100% makes it too wide
[23:48:10] <_ramo> hi
[23:51:10] <Cork> mindis|wurk: box-sizing: border-box
[23:51:12] <_ramo> i have to input field with the same class name on one page...     both input fields have default text "click me".... for each field i have one  submit button. i submit the data via .ajax. if i type in the right input field something and press the right submit button, i see the "default" text in the database
[23:51:24] <Cork> mindis|wurk: you need prefixes there though
[23:51:29] <mindis|wurk> Cork thanks, just found that myself
[23:52:57] <mindis|wurk> worked in chrome and IE9 without prefix but firefox was a disappointment. oh well
[23:53:35] <Cork> mindis|wurk: its not a standard, so it should be prefixed
[23:53:49] <Cork> ie forced the hand on a few of them though
[23:53:56] <krz> is it fine to have jquery and mootools together in an application?
[23:54:20] <Cork> krz: jquery is crafted to be able to co exist with any framework
[23:54:46] <Cork> krz: it adds a lot of uneeded overhead though, so should be avoided
[23:54:58] <Cork> but its not related to jquery though
[23:55:28] <mindis|wurk> another thing i've found extremely problematic is getting text to center horizontally and vertically in buttons in the three major browsers
[23:55:44] <Cork> heh, ya its fun :)
[23:55:49] <mindis|wurk> it seems to get particularily troublesome if the value is only one char
[23:56:08] <Cork> keep away from padding and fiddle with line-height makes it "ok"
[23:56:46] <mindis|wurk> funny enough it's the horizontal centering that's causing more problems atm
[23:57:28] <Cork> ya, it a pain
