[00:01:20] <Hilton> The way it is, every incoming key is split (<section>-<id>-<field>). We look for a known section with a series of elseifs, then have a switch statement to handle fields. Switch allows for simple common data handling.
[00:02:30] <Hilton> Of course before any of it is a login check, then a flag check (can they edit in this area?), then another flag check (can they edit in <section>, and/or specifically on <id>?).
[00:05:08] <Hilton> The ID-specific checks allow for the user to edit things like their own user profile, even if they don't have any other access to the user database, using the exact same systems and functions - no extra code. Also allows us to grant accounts that can view or edit a single record (and all directly related records) with a simple flag.
[00:10:11] <jop008> Hi Is is possible to let autocomplete starts matching at the beginning of the strings
[00:10:38] <jop008> If more than 10 items matched the starting string can be below as well
[00:11:39] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[00:11:49] <Starcraftmazter> in a selector, what does a colon denote?
[00:11:51] <Starcraftmazter> like :input
[00:13:03] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: psudo selectors normally
[00:13:14] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: :input in this case is a jquery sizzle function
[00:13:22] <Cork> ?api :input
[00:13:23] <b-ot> Cork: :input Selector: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[00:13:38] <Hilton> Cork: Why button?
[00:13:42] <Starcraftmazter> ic
[00:13:47] <Cork> Hilton: button?
[00:13:57] <Cork> ah
[00:13:58] <Hilton> Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements - why button?
[00:14:03] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: buttons can have data too
[00:14:03] <Starcraftmazter> is it fine to use find().not() ?
[00:14:11] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: yes
[00:14:16] <Hilton> Does it work? Then yes. :)
[00:15:07] <Cork> jop008: are you using remote data or local?
[00:15:47] <jop008> remote
[00:16:29] <jop008> I tested it on the iPad and user experience is not bad to find a place out of 36000
[00:16:34] <Cork> jop008: then you just decide server side what it should match
[00:16:59] <Cork> jop008: like not adding % infront if your using sql for example
[00:17:02] <jop008> Now I fetch all the places and filter client site
[00:17:21] <MrSavage> Can anyone tell me how to use the $.get and use the data variable in the callback to search for normal text?
[00:17:30] <MrSavage> Also I don't want tags to get in the way
[00:17:48] <Cork> MrSavage: use the .done() callback handler
[00:18:00] <Cork> ?api jquery.get
[00:18:00] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.get(): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[00:18:54] <MrSavage> Cork: I am using it already
[00:19:18] <Cork> MrSavage: what type of content are you fetching?
[00:19:20] <Cork> html?
[00:19:24] <MrSavage> Cork: this is what I have so far http://pastebin.com/YFcj8mnw
[00:19:34] <MrSavage> I want to search for text through users posts
[00:19:39] <Cork> MrSavage: data.search()
[00:19:46] <Cork> data is a string
[00:19:59] <MrSavage> what is data though? It's a bunch of elements that I have no idea what they are
[00:20:09] <MrSavage> when I looked at $(data)
[00:20:11] <Cork> MrSavage: no data is a string
[00:20:18] <Cork> $() converts the string to dom
[00:20:34] <MrSavage> but I don't want the HTML tags to get in the way Cork
[00:20:35] <Cork> and right now you do it over and over again in a loop
[00:20:48] <MrSavage> lol
[00:20:49] <MrSavage> woops
[00:20:57] <MrSavage> I'm new to javascript
[00:21:00] <MrSavage> as well to jquery
[00:21:11] <Cork> well...
[00:21:39] <Cork> i guess you could try something like var noMarkup = $(data).text();
[00:21:44] <Cork> and noMarkup.search()
[00:22:48] <MrSavage> Cork: I tried text() but it gives me random scripts as well
[00:23:10] <Cork> MrSavage: not much you can do about that i'm afraid
[00:23:24] <Cork> not in an efficient way at least
[00:23:45] <MrSavage> can i somehow manipulate using the DOM?
[00:23:47] <Cork> you could try something like
[00:24:50] <Cork> var content = $(data); content.find('script').remove(); content.filter('script').remove(); var noMarkup = content.text()
[00:24:56] <Cork> not sure if that will do what you want though
[00:25:24] <MrSavage> i see
[00:25:31] <MrSavage> i think i will leave the scripts in
[00:25:38] <MrSavage> just to improve efficiency
[00:28:31] <MrSavage> Cork: You don't know how to open a new tab do you?
[00:28:51] <Cork> MrSavage: window.open('url')
[00:29:00] <MrSavage> but i get a popup blocker
[00:29:04] <Cork> ya
[00:29:07] <MrSavage> is that only bypassed if i click?
[00:29:16] <Cork> you can disable it
[00:29:29] <Cork> the point of popup blockers is that they block popups :)
[00:29:41] <MrSavage> i don't want to disable it lol
[00:29:58] <Cork> MrSavage: then you have to go through the allow popup menu for each time it is blocked
[00:30:30] <MrSavage> is there an a href link that opens in a new tab instead of a new window?
[00:30:41] <Cork> target="_blank"
[00:35:02] <MrSavage> Cork: what's my best bet for having a popup window with clickable links?
[00:35:14] <pirret> hello, in this example code, how i can make this "bar" div same width with "header" div when scrolling down? http://jsfiddle.net/p8Znb/5/
[00:35:17] <Cork> MrSavage: what do you mean?
[00:35:27] <pirret> i somehow need to calculate "header" div width
[00:35:35] <MrSavage> Cork: I'm gonna give out a list or clickable URLs
[00:35:46] <MrSavage> Cork: and I'm wondering if I should use the jquery dialog for this
[00:35:50] <Cork> MrSavage: you need to append them to the current page
[00:36:09] <MrSavage> isn't that easy?
[00:36:14] <MrSavage> just put it on the head or something?
[00:36:25] <Cork> MrSavage: the link won't be clicked
[00:36:30] <Cork> you will have to do that manually
[00:37:02] <Cork> $(document.body).append('<a href="" target="_blank">click me</a>')
[00:37:53] <MrSavage> Cork: should i use the jquery dialog?
[00:38:00] <MrSavage> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#default
[00:38:11] <Cork> MrSavage: you could use iframes
[00:38:20] <Cork> dialog can't show third party pages by default
[00:38:22] <MrSavage> which is easier?
[00:38:34] <MrSavage> I just want clickable links so I can open a new tab
[00:38:41] <Cork> MrSavage: for what your doing it sounds like you don't want to run in content script
[00:38:54] <Cork> you want chrome script (privileged scripting)
[00:39:00] <MrSavage> ?
[00:39:15] <MrSavage> I just want a window shown on the page that gives a list of clickable links
[00:39:19] <Cork> cause you will constantly hit upon limitations
[00:39:24] <MrSavage> kind of like a popup but on the same page
[00:39:36] <MrSavage> so which one should i have for that?
[00:39:43] <Cork> dialog could do that
[00:40:03] <Cork> you need to create an element attach the links to it
[00:40:11] <Cork> and then run .dialog() on the element
[00:40:16] <MrSavage> alright
[00:40:23] <MrSavage> is there a good tutorial for it?
[00:42:07] <Cork> have a look at https://learn.jquery.com/
[00:42:49] <MrSavage> so far I only have: var dialog = document.createElement('dialog'); document.gead.appendChild(dialog);   lol
[00:42:50] <Cork> http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/ is also quite good
[00:43:10] <Cork> MrSavage: that isn't even valid
[00:43:19] <MrSavage> i'm very new
[00:43:43] <Cork> var dialog=$('<div>'); dialog.append(link); .... dialog.dialog();
[00:43:54] <Cork> but you are way ahead of your self
[00:43:59] <Cork> you should learn the basics
[00:44:52] <MrSavage> I'm trying to create this tag {<div id="dialog" title="Basic dialog">} as show at https://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[00:45:05] <MrSavage> since this is a clientside script executing on my end
[00:45:20] <MrSavage> which the server is not providing, so pretty much a userscript
[00:45:40] <Cork> MrSavage: if your writing user script, work in chrome code
[00:45:49] <Cork> then you don't have to fiddle with all of this
[00:45:53] <MrSavage> chrome code?
[00:46:01] <Cork> privileged code
[00:46:23] <Cork> MrSavage: script you inject into the page from userscripts is limited to content scripting
[00:46:23] <MrSavage> what is that?
[00:46:36] <Cork> MrSavage: your in too deep
[00:46:42] <Cork> start at the beginning
[00:46:56] <Cork> or i will have to explain every thing in minute details
[00:47:02] <MrSavage> i will eventually
[00:47:18] <Cork> then eventually should be now
[00:47:39] <MrSavage> it's almost 4 am
[00:47:44] <MrSavage> i just want to finish this before going to bed lol
[00:48:07] <Cork> MrSavage: i don't think you will
[00:48:17] <MrSavage> I'm at the last part
[00:48:19] <Cork> unless you get someone to do it for you
[00:48:23] <MrSavage> just need to get that dialog working
[00:48:36] <MrSavage> i'll show you my code after
[01:01:27] <MrSavage> Cork: How do you stop the execution of a script that you are running from firefox console?
[01:01:44] <Cork> MrSavage: reloading the page?
[01:03:22] <pirret> hello, in this example code, how i can make this "bar" div same width with "header" div when scrolling down? http://jsfiddle.net/p8Znb/5/
[01:05:32] <Cork> pirret: you would have to set it to the width of the content
[01:05:40] <Cork> instead of width: 100%;
[01:05:53] <pirret> ok sorry i explained this wrong
[01:06:29] <pirret> i need to calculate the width if header div
[01:06:39] <pirret> and based on that value, make bar div same width
[01:07:01] <pirret> because where i am gonan use this, the div width will change
[01:07:45] <pirret> width of header div*
[01:09:13] <Cork> pirret: http://jsfiddle.net/p8Znb/6/
[01:10:00] <pirret> oh, thanks..that was easy
[01:11:32] <MrSavage> Cork: why am I getting TypeError: $(...).dialog is not a function
[01:11:42] <Cork> MrSavage: you need to load jquery ui
[01:11:50] <MrSavage> i did
[01:11:50] <Cork> + the jquery ui css files
[01:11:55] <Cork> MrSavage: no you didn't
[01:11:57] <MrSavage> i need the CSS files as well?
[01:12:15] <Cork> MrSavage: what the error means is that the jqeury ui dialog function is missing
[01:12:33] <Cork> MrSavage: and unless you made a custom build without the dialog, that means you haven't loaded jquery ui
[01:12:41] <MrSavage> Cork: I did this: http://pastebin.com/sDBx67aW
[01:12:44] <MrSavage> it should load
[01:14:20] <MrSavage> Cork: it shows the script in my inspector
[01:14:56] <Cork> MrSavage: your code is racy
[01:15:03] <MrSavage> yeah
[01:15:05] <Cork> MrSavage: you load jquery and jqueryui
[01:15:10] <Cork> but you don't know what is loaded first
[01:15:40] <Cork> if jquery ui might fail cause jquery isn't loaded
[01:15:56] <Cork> and code in the jquery "main" might fail cause jquery ui isn't loaded yet
[01:18:14] <MrSavage> Cork: I got it working!!!!
[01:48:09] <IamTrying> http://paste.ubuntu.com/7106951/ - Is this calculation correct? my speed is 5 mega bytes per second?
[01:48:35] <IamTrying> My download speed is actually 20 MB per second, why its saying 5MB ?
[01:49:13] <MrSavage> Cork: For $('#dialog') how do you index the p tag in there?
[01:49:22] <MrSavage> $('#dialog').$('p') isn't working
[01:49:31] <Cork> ?api find
[01:49:42] <Cork> <_<
[01:49:48] <Cork> ah, the bot died
[01:49:59] <Cork> MrSavage: $('#dialog').find('p')
[01:50:08] <Cork> MrSavage: or simply  $('#dialog p')
[01:50:37] <MrSavage> Cork: and lastly how do you append to it?
[01:50:43] <MrSavage> such as adding more to p?
[01:51:59] <Cork> MrSavage: you append to #dialog
[01:52:13] <MrSavage> alright thanks
[01:52:21] <MrSavage> the thing that creates me the most
[01:52:27] <MrSavage> that confuses*
[01:52:40] <MrSavage> is using document.createElement('');
[01:52:55] <MrSavage> since there's no page that holds all the attributes such as onload
[01:53:03] <MrSavage> or rel or media
[01:53:05] <MrSavage> and if i need these
[01:53:28] <Cork> MrSavage: $('<elm name>') === $(document.createElement('elm name'))
[01:54:08] <Cork> MrSavage: those are header tags, and you can't use them in side body
[01:54:16] <zth> i'm wondering whether i can do this with jquery: i want to have a form with 2 fields and 3 submit buttons, where each button will refer the user to a specific url with the contents of the 2 fields appended in various ways. can i do this with pure jquery, without having to use PHP or similar?
[01:54:26] <MrSavage> Cork: but they don't get appended
[01:54:32] <MrSavage> Cork: but thanks for that
[01:54:49] <Cork> MrSavage: you create them, that doesn't mean they are appended
[01:55:32] <Cork> zth: kinda, but not really
[01:55:54] <Cork> zth: you could send it as params in the url, and have js grab them and prefill the fields in the page
[01:56:09] <Cork> zth: but that is only if the server doesn't do anything to the params
[01:57:17] <zth> Cork, ahh, sorry, i didn't clarify enough. it's perfectly fine to send them as params in the url (in fact, the field contents will be supplied as queries for search functions on a few well-established websites i have no control over)
[01:57:43] <Cork> zth: if you have no control of the website
[01:57:48] <Cork> then you can't do anything when they have loaded
[01:57:54] <MrSavage> Cork: this is what I made http://pastebin.com/qDaNaYGE
[01:57:56] <Cork> including prefill fields
[01:58:35] <Cork> MrSavage: you prob want to build an array in the loop
[01:58:44] <MrSavage> ?
[01:58:46] <Cork> and then .join('') and append it all in one go
[01:58:53] <Cork> cause the way you do it is very slow
[01:59:07] <MrSavage> i don't see
[01:59:56] <zth> Cork, i don't want to prefill fields though. let me try to explain again: on my own website, i have 2 fields in a form. in these fields, the user inputs their name and website address. below the 2 fields there are 3 buttons. each button links to a different sites search function with the name and website address appended (to search for that name and exclude results from the own website). do you get what i mean? sorry for uncle
[01:59:56] <zth> ar explanations..
[02:08:12] <fabioportieri> o/
[02:42:02] <fosser_josh> hi guys, i have two buttons on interface which hide and show two different div at same position. button one hide div two and shows div one. button two hide div two and shows div one. what happen sometime on ipad is when div two shows up on button two press some of the tabs in div two get frozen/ locked. I cant able to use them, when i touch on them they didnt work but some tabs works fine.
[02:42:36] <fosser_josh> how can i solve this problem? is there something to clear UI?
[02:43:51] <Cork> fosser_josh: might be a rendering problem
[02:44:02] <Cork> or it might be a transparent element covering something
[02:44:26] <fosser_josh> Cork: its only problem on ipad, on desktop it works fine.
[02:44:57] <fosser_josh> Cork: how can i find if there is some transperent element covering those tabs?
[02:45:15] <Cork> fosser_josh: not sure on a mobile actually
[02:45:37] <fosser_josh> will firebug help me with that?
[02:45:55] <Cork> firebug on ios safari?!?
[02:46:08] <Cork> well yes use the inspector
[02:46:18] <Cork> (didn't know firebug light worked there)
[02:47:06] <fosser_josh> well i can check on desktop
[02:47:54] <iwantoski> I'm working on a form where I will be required to add and remove elements (inputs and whatnot) on-the-fly. Disregarding the backend, is there any disadvantages to omitting the form element? Browser support required stretched from IE8+.
[02:47:56] <fosser_josh> may be ipad is having less area so transperent element covering that area and on desktop it might be somewhere else
[02:48:49] <Grundell> okay might be a stupid question for those who know. But im trying to gett the Trigger in this one to slide out the "slide" how do i make this happen? http://jsfiddle.net/DcWS2/618/
[02:49:01] <Grundell> Hello btw.
[02:50:01] <Grundell> if anyone is able to help that would be amazing
[02:50:31] <Cork> fosser_josh: you mean it should push the demo demo part?
[02:50:51] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[02:50:54] <Cork> Grundell: ^
[02:50:57] <fosser_josh> dats Grundell
[02:51:02] <Cork> ya, sorry
[02:51:23] <Grundell> dats ?
[02:51:31] <Cork> that's
[02:51:58] <Grundell> okay, really not sure if you're making fun of me now :D ?
[02:52:11] <Cork> Grundell: see my question asked to the wrong nick
[02:52:30] <Grundell> ahh okay :)
[02:53:12] <fosser_josh> Grundell: i am just correcting Cork
[02:53:36] <Grundell> well i want slide to slide out when you push the trigger the way it does now, but i don't want the whole slide to be the actual trigger... this because im going to have a form inside slide
[02:53:58] <Grundell> So when trigger is pushed, slide come out :)
[02:54:31] <Grundell> fosser_josh: haha okay :)
[02:54:48] <Grundell> Sorry that earlier was for you Cork,if you understand :)
[02:55:08] <Cork> ah
[02:55:59] <Cork> Grundell: http://jsfiddle.net/DcWS2/619/ ?
[02:57:49] <Grundell> Awesome, exactly what i tried except that i wrote this: http://jsfiddle.net/DcWS2/621/ Is there a difference between  $(this).closest('.slide'). and $('slide') ?
[02:58:22] <Cork> Grundell: works too
[02:58:51] <Cork> if trigger wasn't an id this one would break if you had more then one slide though
[03:00:41] <Grundell> okay :)
[03:00:47] <Grundell> thanks !
[03:01:12] <uskerine> hi, i have a jQuery function under "jQuery(window).scroll(function() {" that I would like force to happen on page load
[03:01:38] <uskerine> could I add something to the end of my html so it will launch that function on page load?
[03:01:39] <uskerine> thanks
[03:01:40] <Cork> uskerine: then define it outside
[03:01:47] <Cork> and call it in both places
[03:03:06] <uskerine> ok, then there is something weird with my code, i have done that but it is not being executed (I put an alert before the comment to see if code was actually ran by the browser)
[03:03:46] <domenico> Hello, My problem is that I have to make open a download window from a jquery function. For example a user clicks on a button and I do something and after user could download a file. I just do it using form and submit function but I would avoid to open a new window/tab with target="_blank" on the form.
[03:03:46] <Cork> uskerine: put the code in jsfiddle.net and post the link here
[03:04:31] <Cork> domenico: you could skip using target and it would just trigger the download
[03:04:48] <Cork> unless you can get none downloads from the link that is
[03:06:30] <uskerine> i will try that (it is a long page with lots of js)
[03:06:54] <Cork> uskerine: just the part of how you define the function
[03:07:00] <Cork> and how you call it
[03:07:14] <Cork> uskerine: if you define it inside other functions include that part too
[03:07:22] <Cork> uskerine: all the other parts isn't needed
[03:07:37] <uskerine> can a simple JS alert be placed within jQuery(window).load(function(){ ?
[03:07:46] <Cork> uskerine: yes
[03:07:56] <uskerine> should I see it once page is loaded?
[03:08:02] <Cork> though for debugging console.log() is recommended
[03:08:17] <Cork> as alert can trigger event reordering
[03:08:26] <uskerine> ok
[03:10:44] <uskerine> Wow, I was modifying the source FOR ANOTHER FOLDER
[03:10:49] <uskerine> :-D
[03:10:51] <uskerine> it works now
[03:10:57] <Cork> lol
[03:11:01] <Cork> been there done that
[03:11:10] <Cork> you always feel so stupid when you do :D
[03:15:58] <ph88> does anyone have some good reading on duplicate event listeners ?
[03:16:00] <domenico> Cork, thanks, your suggest works
[03:16:16] <ph88> ie. if they are a problem, and strategies how to avoid them
[03:16:21] <uskerine> if I define twice "jQuery(window).load(function(){", will the contents of both definitions be executed or will the latest definition override the first?
[03:16:52] <Cork> ph88: 1. never add event listeners in a loop, 2. never use return false;
[03:17:02] <Cork> ph88: those two should handle most cases
[03:17:17] <fosser_josh> Cork: i think its a dialog box which causing problem. on button one click dialog box popup and then on button click in dialog box i am closing dialog box and removing it. using .dialog("close") and .remove() method. i check the area covered by dialog box and thats causing problem. Isnt it sufficient .dialog("close") and remove() methods to close dialog box? is there anything else i can use it to clear dialogbox area?
[03:17:28] <jop008> Can you hide a picture if it is not on the server?
[03:17:32] <Cork> uskerine: each time you call .load it will add a new onload event listener
[03:17:42] <jop008> client solution needed
[03:17:48] <Cork> jop008: you can listen for the onerror event on the image
[03:18:05] <jop008> okay
[03:18:08] <uskerine> ok thanks!
[03:18:10] <Joey__> what is wrong with return false?
[03:18:13] <jop008> thx
[03:18:23] <Cork> Joey__: it kills the event propagation
[03:18:53] <Cork> Joey__: meaning if you even need to attach an additional event listener, you have to dig up the other one and adjust it to work with the new code
[03:18:54] <Joey__> oh you meant in events, I misunderstood and thought it was in general
[03:19:19] <Cork> Joey__: "on duplicate event listeners ?"
[03:19:55] <ph88> Cork: i have one element that listens to elements in a collection. Right now i have for each new element a new listener, but maybe it's better to have one listener for all the elements and then depending on the event payload figure out which element it is ?
[03:20:13] <Cork> ph88: use event delegation instead
[03:20:25] <ph88> Cork: yes that's what i mean
[03:20:55] <Cork> ph88: and yes, that is the loop part i talked about before
[03:21:01] <ph88> Cork: but i'm used to using e.target ... but i think some of the events are not triggered by actual elements in the page ?
[03:21:14] <ph88> i don't like my design anymore ;'(
[03:21:17] <Cork> ph88: e.target should work just the same
[03:21:21] <ph88> ok
[03:21:30] <Cork> and this should work the same as it use to
[03:21:37] <Cork> "this" that is
[03:22:08] <uskerine> how can i delay a bit execution of code?
[03:22:23] <Cork> uskerine: setTimeout
[03:22:36] <Cork> uskerine: note though, that makes the code async
[03:22:50] <Cork> so you need to move everything that should happen after it into the function it calls
[03:24:30] <uskerine> I want to do something once page is loaded, so, should I put that code inside the function of the timeout? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1836105/how-to-wait-5-seconds-with-jquery
[03:24:39] <uskerine> should I put my code in onload or in ready?
[03:24:43] <Elrinth2> is there an easy way to do jquery binds when a certain page has been loaded... like $("acertainpageloaded.html").on("click", function() { });
[03:24:46] <Cork> uskerine: no use the load event
[03:25:10] <Cork> uskerine: if you want it to happen when the dom has been generated but before anything is visible use ready
[03:25:35] <Elrinth2> $("post:complete", function() {
[03:25:35] <Cork> Elrinth2: no, you would have to set an id on the body or something like that
[03:25:53] <Cork> and there is none for ajax
[03:26:08] <Elrinth2> so there is no way outside to detect if a new post or get has been done?
[03:26:28] <uskerine> ok
[03:26:33] <Cork> there is the global done event jquery generates
[03:26:40] <Cork> but it doesn't say the source of the data
[03:26:45] <Elrinth2> damnit ;)
[03:27:16] <Cork> Elrinth2: the event is mainly to handle throbbers and other indicators like that
[03:49:24] <dweeb_> Is there a simple way to keep an element inside the viewport? When I hover an image I want to show a preview img and keep it inside the viewport.
[03:49:48] <systemfault> dweeb_: position:fixed in CSS?
[03:51:09] <dweeb_> systemfault: But I want to show the preview relative to the image I hover. If I use position: fixed I need to keep it absolute to the viewport?
[03:52:01] <systemfault> dweeb_: Then you could probably use position: absolute to position the pic relatively to some parent element (which would have position:relative;)

[04:15:28] <krambiorix> hi, i add an input element to a div ( -> <input class="input-amount" type="text" val="400000"> )   but the value is not shown in the input field.... What can i do?
[04:16:30] <kovshenin> hey folks. what's the best way to return a deferred promise and resolve it right afterwards?
[04:17:12] <systemfault> $.when?
[04:17:45] <`ULT> hello all, i have two forms on my site and one function to validate and handle both forms >> http://jsbin.com/voguweyo/8/
[04:17:46] <systemfault> krambiorix: Why did you think the attribute is "val" and not "value"?
[04:17:52] <krambiorix> ow boy
[04:18:30] <`ULT> but my submithandler isnt working correct, i didnt get a error or succes message
[04:18:45] <`ULT> i think i made a mistake with $(this), can anyone take a look to it?
[04:19:17] <`ULT> *someone*
[04:20:15] <kovshenin> systemfault: $.when( foo() ).done() makes sense, but foo() creates and resolves a deferred object before returning it :( how can I alter foo() to wait for that done() to be attached before resolving?
[04:20:43] <systemfault> `ULT: To make your code easier to understand, you could add a line between 82 and 83 var currentForm = this;  and use currentForm everywhere you need it.
[04:21:23] <`ULT> thats a good idea
[04:21:48] <systemfault> `ULT: Yeah, that will probably fix your "this" issue at the same time.
[04:22:16] <`ULT> i will give it a try, moment
[04:22:20] <systemfault> kovshenin: It's difficult for me to understand your problem (Am I'm reallly good with promises)
[04:22:22] <`ULT> thanks!
[04:22:25] <systemfault> *And
[04:22:35] <`ULT> systemfault, how can you see the lines?
[04:22:44] <systemfault> `ULT: view-source
[04:22:48] <systemfault> view-source:http://jsbin.com/voguweyo/8
[04:23:07] <wiki> can anyone tell me why when i click on "zabudol som heslo ..." the box shows and than dissapear again http://gopanda.eu/Prihlasenie   im using something like this in the code http://pastebin.com/xwP8BWjm
[04:23:22] <wiki> however in chrome it doesn' even open so test in firefox
[04:23:53] <`ULT> thx
[04:24:00] <kovshenin> systemfault, I'm thinking the code I'm working with isn't architected too well, but I can be wrong. it's (sometimes) resolving a deferred object before returning it http://pastebin.com/dPY2JBjG so I'm thinking of a way to fix that
[04:25:15] <kovshenin> I'm not good with promises but afaik .done() won't get fired if it's attached after a deferred has already been resolved
[04:25:32] <krambiorix> systemfault, thanks!
[04:25:34] <systemfault> It sure will
[04:25:37] <xec> it should
[04:25:41] <kovshenin> oh
[04:26:01] <systemfault> kovshenin: You can use $.when to return a a promise having a value
[04:26:26] <systemfault> Line 11 could probably be: return $.when(this);
[04:26:32] <`ULT> systemfault: i need to eat now, i will give your answer a try after that
[04:26:32] <wiki> ?
[04:26:50] <kovshenin> systemfault: ok thanks I'll play around with that
[04:27:56] <systemfault> Too bad jQuery's promise implementation sucks :/
[04:28:11] <systemfault> Well.. it doesn't "suck"... but it's really basic
[04:28:39] <wiki> ?
[04:32:37] <`ULT> systemfault: , when i use currentForm i get this: 403 Forbidden  Forbidden
[04:33:02] <tirengarfio_> I have found this script to draw a selection area. Then I would like to use that cropped images in my site, but first I have to cropped them using the data from the selection area, where should I do that cropping? in the client (jQuery) or in the server?
[04:33:12] <tirengarfio_> http://iakob.com/canvas-area-draw/demo.html
[04:33:29] <systemfault> `ULT: Well.. it won't work from jsbin for sure.
[04:33:47] <`ULT> what do you mean?
[04:34:12] <systemfault> `ULT: XHR (AJAX) has a limitation called "same-origin policy", it means that you cannot to requests to a different domain than the one you're one.

[04:34:39] <jop008> how to vertical align the pictures? http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm
[04:34:50] <systemfault> In your case though.. it tries to access process2.php on their server
[04:34:58] <jop008> I tried with vertical-align:middle
[04:35:03] <systemfault> (jsbin's server.. so it won't work)
[04:35:21] <`ULT> true, but when i`m not using the variable, i didnt get that message

[05:08:54] <Cork> wiki: event.preventDefault()
[05:09:14] <Cork> also you shouldn't use links without working hrefs
[05:10:15] <ickmund> I'm having something similar to a scope issue here. >> function test() {console.log($("body");)}; test(); << gives a ReferenceError: $ is not defined, while >> console.log($("body")); << doesn't... what gives?!
[05:10:42] <ickmund> jquery-2.1.0
[05:10:53] <aracodex123> hey guys, does anyone know how to deal with getElementById(stringVariable) ? I passed in a variable but its not working, but if I pass in the actual string, it works : .getElementById("asdf98234")
[05:10:54] <Cork> ickmund: you most likely execute it before jquery is loaded
[05:11:10] <ickmund> then why would the second test work?
[05:11:29] <Cork> aracodex123: check the content of the variable, cause js don't care
[05:11:35] <wiki> Cork so better use div ?
[05:11:38] <Cork> ickmund: you might execute it later
[05:11:54] <ickmund> I'm running both of these from the chrome console
[05:12:00] <Cork> wiki: you can use <button> or something like <span class="link" tabstop="0">
[05:12:08] <aracodex123> Cork: I'm testing this in chrome console, and yes, when I do a console.log(variable) , I get the string
[05:12:28] <Cork> aracodex123: jsfiddle.net a live demo of the problem
[05:13:09] <Cork> ickmund: are you using something like jQuery(function($) {}) ?
[05:13:31] <ickmund> bloody hell, it works in firefox... sigh
[05:13:40] <ickmund> no I'm not Cork
[05:14:21] <Cork> ickmund: wait... are you sure $ is jquery in the outer example?
[05:14:34] <Cork> $.fn.jquery
[05:14:36] <ickmund> I am not sure of anything at this point :)
[05:14:55] <ickmund> $.fn is not defined
[05:15:04] <Cork> so $ isn't jquery
[05:15:19] <ickmund> I am not loading any other libraries
[05:15:20] <Cork> might even be something the console defines
[05:15:24] <Cork> some consoles to
[05:15:25] <Cork> *do
[05:15:39] <Cork> you could try jQuery() instead of $()
[05:15:51] <Cork> if that doesn't work you don't have jquery loaded
[05:17:28] <ickmund> so chrome console loads its own version of jquery or something? Man this is baffling!
[05:17:52] <Cork> ickmund: some consoles define $ as a shorthand for document.getElementById
[05:18:01] <Cork> or document.querySelectorAll
[05:18:09] <Cork> ickmund: so no not jquery
[05:18:27] <Cork> ickmund: also $ isn't only used by jquery, it is quite commonly used
[05:18:48] <ickmund> ok, many thanks, I'll dive into why it won't load!
[05:23:00] <aracodex123> Cork: I figured it out, it was because of the way in which the node got created, it gets created so fast that the eyes couldn't keep track, but in terms of process, I'm looking for something that doesn't exists yet
[05:23:43] <Cork> aracodex123: that shouldn't happen
[05:23:51] <Cork> at least as long as you have appended it to the page
[05:25:51] <jop008> http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm looks fine on desktop but not fine on an iPHone the picture is small and column toggle is not workin see the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/nXyxS/52/
[05:26:18] <jop008> on the fiddle column toggle is fine in my code only a header cell is removed
[05:26:41] <jop008> thei size of the images on ipad / iphone is real small how to change this?
[05:26:46] <SprkDev> How can I use bootstrap modal to load a video in that window?
[05:27:23] <aracodex123> Cork: I'm running meteor, not sure if u are familiar with that framework. But anyway, I'm binding document.getElementById to my 'keydown input' handler, and when the key gets pressed, an item gets created at the DB level, but it takes awhile before the page gets "re-rendered" and when I try to call "document.getElementById" before the page gets rendered, it returns null
[05:28:09] <Cork> aracodex123: sounds like a classic async situation
[05:29:52] <aracodex123> Cork: yes ... I'll read up some docs, surely they have a way to deal with this
[05:56:24] <jop008> Any idea why the picture is so small on ipad http://jsfiddle.net/nXyxS/52/
[06:01:03] <antihero> Is there an event of some discription that will fire when an element is actually rendered in the DOM?
[06:05:04] <antihero> because google maps always buggers itself up
[06:06:06] <Cork> antihero: no
[06:06:37] <Cork> those events would be in the critical path of the browser so it's not likely to ever be one either
[06:20:59] <`ULT> hello, i have two forms on my site, and 1 function to validate and handle the forms.
[06:21:07] <`ULT> the validation is working, but the handling not
[06:22:13] <`ULT> this is the code: http://prntscr.com/31lv2b
[06:23:51] <`ULT> can someone take a look to it?
[06:24:11] <Joey__> ULT shouldn't "currentform.reset" be "form.reset" ?
[06:24:47] <`ULT> the form witch is submitted need to reset Joey__
[06:24:58] <`ULT> var currentForm = $(this);
[06:25:06] <`ULT> but that part isnt working
[06:25:24] <Joey__> yeah but submithandler is an event
[06:25:37] <Joey__> are you sure that currentForm var is still set when it is called
[06:27:03] <`ULT> no, wait i make a jsbin file

[06:53:07] <pagioss> how can i make sure the jquery.js is loaded correctly in browser
[06:53:18] <pagioss> first day with jquyery ehre
[06:53:22] <beancurd> make sure? or check that it is?
[06:53:55] <beancurd> i guess the quickest way is just to bring up your js console in the browser and type jQuery or $
[06:54:42] <beancurd> or something like $("body").css("background", "red"); something that'll make it overtly obvious that stuff is happening.
[06:56:19] <ankurk_> pagioss: you can do something like "jQuery.fn.jquery;" to check the version, that will make sure you have jQuery loaded
[06:59:29] <`ULT> Joey__:

[07:12:13] <drej> ajpiano happy bday bud
[07:12:42] <Cork> `ULT: you can do something like $('form').not(form).hide()
[07:13:21] <ajpiano> thanks drej

[07:13:40] <`ULT> i think i need to do something with this
[07:14:00] <ankurk_> drej: how was the jQueryTO?
[07:14:02] <Cork> `ULT: in the error callback
[07:14:12] <drej> ankurk_ it was alright, i didnt catch much of day 2
[07:14:26] <drej> because i accidentally had 3 pints for breakfast
[07:14:31] <drej> and then went and cried for a while
[07:14:34] <drej> because im old
[07:14:42] <ankurk_> hehehe, happens
[07:14:48] <`ULT> you dont think that can with $(this)? just like the validation?
[07:16:18] <drej> ankurk_ but otherwise great talks, lots of people, great energy
[07:16:32] <drej> i think they broke some record for attendance
[07:16:40] <drej> most people at a javascript-based conference in canada
[07:16:43] <drej> im not sure if that means anything, but yeah
[07:16:51] <ankurk_> really? I think I will go next year
[07:17:11] <drej> are you in the toronto area?
[07:17:13] <ankurk_> but are there meetups or conferences bound to happen this year in Toronto?
[07:17:34] <ankurk_> Well, I live in Burlington as of now, will shift to Brampton by next month
[07:17:52] <drej> there's always things happening, meetup.com has tons of events
[07:18:06] <drej> html5 meetup group and angularjs meetup groups are pretty big in toronto
[07:18:13] <drej> also im doing a workshop for theymc.com
[07:18:29] <drej> a 10 week "How to be a front end rock star" workshop
[07:18:57] <ankurk_> when is it? I would love to attend if it is after April since I will be free after April
[07:19:15] <drej> downtown toronto, front/jarvis area
[07:19:48] <ankurk_> I could always take a subway I guess, but any idea about dates?
[07:20:07] <drej> late april / early may
[07:20:27] <drej> havent set the dates just yet, will be planning htat out this week actually
[07:20:59] <bberry> hey #jquery.  Am i using the focusout event incorrectly? http://jsfiddle.net/vW6Hp/1/
[07:21:04] <ankurk_> Hope it is early May *fingers crossed*
[07:21:20] <drej> well it'll span 10 weeks, so if you miss the first week or two, its not the end of the wordl
[07:21:22] <drej> world*
[07:21:46] <ankurk_> I really want to start going to workshops and meetups because I will be a college graduate in April :P
[07:22:01] <drej> what college?
[07:22:45] <ankurk_> Sheridan
[07:27:47] <drej> ankurk_ sys analist eh
[07:28:13] <ankurk_> OMG how did you guess? :O
[07:28:22] <drej> you're on linked in :)
[07:28:57] <systemfault> Stalker.
[07:29:01] <drej> yup
[07:29:16] <drej> we're hiring people and so i look up anyone who's remotely local :)
[07:29:41] <ankurk_> drej: really? I would love to join
[07:29:54] <drej> you dont even know what i do
[07:29:55] <drej> lol
[07:30:16] <drej> actually, you're too junior for what we need, we're looking for really senior people
[07:30:22] <drej> 5+ years minimum in experience
[07:30:44] <ankurk_> oh! well, I guess it might be tough for me in next few months to find a full time
[07:30:59] <ankurk_> I have been quite stressed out lately because of that
[07:31:04] <systemfault> ankurk_: A first job can be difficult to find in the field...
[07:31:10] <systemfault> Because HRs are retarded.
[07:31:30] <ankurk_> True that, I found my first co-op after two months :/
[07:32:02] <systemfault> They're like... 10+years of experience on iphone :P
[07:32:14] <systemfault> (The iphone is like 7 years old)
[07:32:52] <ankurk_> hehehehe
[07:33:27] <ankurk_> hopefully I will find one soon,
[07:33:30] <drej> ankurk_ can always get in as a coop or intern
[07:33:43] <beancurd> ankurk_: if you don't have bills to pay, just start building stuff and pushing to github.
[07:34:05] <ankurk_> drej: But I already I have three internships under my belt
[07:34:34] <ankurk_> beancurd: thing is I got bills to pay, rent, phone etc
[07:34:35] <drej> what's your focus? what do you want to be ?
[07:34:41] <drej> front end dev? back end dev? sysadmin ? what
[07:35:15] <ankurk_> My focus has been on web lately. I want to be a Full Stack Dev
[07:35:54] <systemfault> The mystical full-stack programmer....
[07:36:00] <ankurk_> hahaha
[07:36:01] <systemfault> Something that doesn't exists.
[07:36:11] <beancurd> full stack is a pain in the ass.
[07:36:14] <systemfault> Unless you suck at both frontend and backend
[07:36:26] <ankurk_> But I think I like Front End
[07:36:58] <ankurk_> I have been quite influenced by the work of biggies like Addy Osmani
[07:37:16] <systemfault> I'm a backend that was somehow "forced" into frontend...
[07:37:48] <systemfault> Nowadays, I do pretty much only frontend... seems the demand is stronger for good frontends
[07:38:04] <ankurk_> You can do anything using JS these days
[07:42:06] <krambiorix> how can i get the full months between 2 dates? If it's only a half month, don't count it...
[07:45:34] <ankurk_> krambiorix: you can convert the dates to UNIX timestamp and then do a difference on them, then using if, you can exclude the half month differences
[07:46:10] <krambiorix> ankurk_, yeah was thinking that, but how to exlude the not full months?
[07:46:42] <ankurk_> hmm, well, get the difference and if the difference is not full month then exclude it

[07:52:00] <SprkDev> hello
[07:52:16] <SprkDev> How can I use bootstrap modal to load another page?
[07:52:58] <ankurk_> krambiorix: A jsbin of what you have tried can be helpful
[07:53:32] <ankurk_> SprkDev: you can make a button in Modal, and then you can use Window.Location I guess?
[07:53:58] <SprkDev> windows.location I've never heard of that. ANy example or link?
[07:55:04] <ankurk_> SprkDev: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.location

[08:22:44] <ddssc> hey I'm looking for a plugin that adds tags. like [cars[x]] [pets[x]] [stuff[x]]    that you can add or remove by clicking [x]
[08:23:54] <faraway> ddssc: select2 is a lib that supports tagging
[08:23:57] <tcwc__> Hello, anyone here who could help me out a little bit with my contact form code?
[08:25:47] <jop008> Some one a media syle expert? See the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/nXyxS/54/ on iPhone the picture column is real small how to change it?
[08:25:57] <jop008> I now use imagecenter style
[08:26:03] <jop008> imgcenter
[08:26:17] <ddssc> faraway: cheers , looks good
[08:37:09] <`ULT> i need to set up a submit handler for more than 1 page, how can i do this?
[08:39:34] <fabioportieri> `ULT: include your js in both pages and target your forms
[08:41:57] <`ULT> sorry, i mean for more forms in 1 page
[08:42:09] <`ULT> 1 submithandler for multiple forms
[08:43:53] <duch_kazatel> 1 handler for multiple forms
[08:43:58] <duch_kazatel> sounds dangerous
[08:44:26] <drej> create a button that goes through all forms, serializes the inputs, and submits it
[08:44:48] <decx> don't use multiple forms if it's actually just one form
[08:44:58] <drej> that too
[08:45:39] <decx> the form tag doesnt care, you can put everything in there. it's like your... nevermind
[08:45:46] <drej> MOMMA
[08:45:49] <drej> there, i finished it for you
[08:46:09] <duch_kazatel> you can always take the old terrible microsoft route and wrap the entire page in a form if you really want.
[08:46:14] <duch_kazatel> (don't do that btw)
[08:46:40] <jop008> When I inject html in a table body the column toggel is not working fine
[08:46:50] <drej> dont do that then
[08:46:58] <jop008> Ony one header cell is deleted when doing this
[08:47:25] <jop008> If I make it static like this $("#activitydetails").trigger("create"); toggle column is working okay
[08:50:12] <drej> jop008 we'd have to see your code
[08:50:16] <drej> can you setup a testcase on jsfiddle.net
[08:50:19] <masscrx> hi
[08:50:23] <drej> HELLO
[08:50:36] <masscrx> Hello World!
[08:50:44] <jop008> the code is in the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/nXyxS/54/
[08:50:45] <masscrx>  is in jquery some function to catch last created dom element ?
[08:50:53] <duch_kazatel> masscrx nope.
[08:51:00] <masscrx> only .last ?
[08:51:11] <duch_kazatel> masscrx .last() is not the "last created dom element"
[08:51:17] <masscrx> yeah i know
[08:51:29] <masscrx> but this is the only function which could I use
[08:51:43] <fanboy> I have <div class="media mediaItem>foo</div> <div class="media mediaItem"></div>. And yet $('div.mediaItem:empty') returns nothing?
[08:51:46] <fanboy> why?
[08:51:48] <duch_kazatel> what problem are you actually trying to solve, masscrx
[08:52:27] <duch_kazatel> fanboy is that your exact code?  because that has a typo in it.
[08:52:45] <fanboy> not exact, but where?
[08:52:54] <duch_kazatel>  <div class="media mediaItem> ->  <div class="media mediaItem">
[08:52:57] <fanboy> oh, no "
[08:52:59] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v793h/
[08:53:01] <fanboy> yeah, just a typo
[08:53:01] <duch_kazatel> works here.
[08:53:48] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: I have dynamic dropdown in my rails aplication, so when user select some Warehouse, in the second dropdown is list with items, and this works fine, but when I click on the same page 'add new item' new <select> is created but without list, so I must call function from rails to fill 'last created dom element'
[08:54:37] <masscrx> But maybe .last could be enough
[08:54:48] <duch_kazatel> masscrx you could always generate a uniqueID on the fly and save that, then reference it later when you need to interact with the select.
[08:55:08] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: I have genereated unique id
[08:55:23] <duch_kazatel> then store that and reference it?
[08:55:36] <masscrx> what do you mean 'store' ? where store ?
[08:56:12] <duch_kazatel> in an appropriately scoped variable.  something scoped to, say, the closure that contains all your code.
[08:56:46] <fanboy> nope, does not work in my code
[08:56:54] <fanboy> $('div.mediaItem') is fine
[08:57:03] <duch_kazatel> fanboy then you've got something else going on./
[08:57:09] <fanboy> returns two divs
[08:57:19] <fanboy> $('div.mediaItem:empty')..nothing
[08:57:19] <duch_kazatel> are they both truly empty?
[08:57:38] <fanboy> hmm maybe I need a trim
[08:58:33] <decx> relying on something like an empty div can'T be a good approach for anything
[08:58:42] <duch_kazatel> yeah there's that, too.
[08:58:43] <fanboy> think i tried trim and couldnt figure how to combine it with a div childs
[08:58:58] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: you mean id of select ?
[08:59:24] <masscrx> https://gist.github.com/masscrx/76d0ff84c0e72d104a1e this is my example fieldset
[08:59:45] <masscrx> so store id of last created <select> and then fill with items yep ?
[09:00:37] <duch_kazatel> masscrx basically.
[09:00:47] <duch_kazatel> at least, that's one way to do it.
[09:05:28] <Bloomberg> Hi
[09:06:04] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/bx6rs/
[09:06:30] <Bloomberg> I I tried to acces outside to that function to valueSend var and is undefied?
[09:06:34] <Bloomberg> n*
[09:07:01] <bengalol> well, youre using var
[09:07:08] <bengalol> which makes it a temp var
[09:07:11] <decx> google javascript scope
[09:07:54] <Bloomberg> So, how can I access to that value outside of that function?
[09:07:58] <duch_kazatel> not a "temp far" - is scopes it to the function.
[09:07:59] <ddssc> faraway: so in select2 how do I fetch the values from the field?
[09:08:11] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg declare the var in a parent scope.
[09:08:22] <duch_kazatel> var myVar; up in the closes parent scope.
[09:08:23] <ddssc> faraway: standard jq .val selector?
[09:08:31] <duch_kazatel> then remove the var declaration from inside the function,.
[09:10:03] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel : thank you man
[09:10:29] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg next step: rename "jsonqueryphp" - that is a TERRIBLE function na,e.
[09:10:33] <duch_kazatel> *name
[09:13:47] <faraway> ddssc: elm.select2('val') will return the array   ..... elm.val()  will return a string comma separated
[09:15:01] <ddssc> faraway: thanks, the api is really extensive...
[09:15:05] <sw33tlull4by>  hey there, on the move so I have to make it quick apollogies: i am using jqueryuis autocomplete-functionality, I was thinking about providing a preview of the content selected by title as well,preview is shipped via response, how do i go about and toggle previews, when the user is going through the suggessted findings without continuing to type?
[09:15:52] <faraway> ddssc: yes it really takes some time to get into it, but i think it is one of the best libs of that kind.
[09:16:19] <DansVC> Hi :D
[09:16:48] <DansVC> hi :d
[09:16:51] <duch_kazatel> hello
[09:16:55] <DansVC> :D
[09:17:04] <duch_kazatel> sw33tlull4by huh?
[09:17:15] <DansVC> duch do you are a profetional?
[09:17:21] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:17:24] <decx> good lord
[09:17:39] <duch_kazatel> DansVC am I a professional?
[09:17:51] <DansVC> yes
[09:17:53] <sw33tlull4by> duch_kazatel, ok, imagine you are given a list of titles to chose from,
[09:17:55] <duch_kazatel> yes, I am.
[09:17:59] <DansVC> :D
[09:18:18] <DansVC> can you give your opinion of my website?
[09:18:41] <duch_kazatel> uh, i guess?
[09:18:45] <sw33tlull4by> duch_kazatel, behind each title there is content, while going from one select to the next selection via array-keys, i want  preview for this content to be updated
[09:18:57] <DansVC> http://ray-dee-oh.pt.vc/ thx :D
[09:19:07] <duch_kazatel> DansVC what kind of website is it?
[09:19:16] <duch_kazatel> sw33tlull4by try typing it out all at once, instead of small fragments.
[09:19:16] <faraway> ddssc: btw, if you use bootstrap, there is also a project delivering a stylesheet that fits better into bootsrap
[09:19:19] <DansVC> is a homepage :D
[09:19:39] <DansVC> but is a little uncommon :(
[09:19:42] <sw33tlull4by> duch_kazatel, ok, imagine you are given a list of titles to chose from, behind each title there is content, while going from one suggestion to the next  via array-keys, i want  preview for this content to be updated
[09:20:03] <duch_kazatel> DansVC woah, uh, no idea what you're doing there, but it's partiall broken for me.
[09:20:17] <duch_kazatel> sw33tlull4by okay - have a fiddle of your current setup?
[09:20:18] <DansVC> :s
[09:20:26] <decx> what's up with the svg painting?
[09:20:55] <duch_kazatel> DansVC the little icon in the bottom left is broken for me, and the navigation concept, though novel, isn't really a great idea.
[09:21:23] <decx> i can't do anything
[09:21:40] <DansVC> :s
[09:21:58] <DansVC> yes lots of my friends say that it's very hard
[09:22:07] <duch_kazatel> DansVC there's a reason you see consistency in basics like navigation - users have come to expect certain things.
[09:22:25] <sw33tlull4by> duch_kazatel, I am not looking for a solution, I just want to be pointed to a mechanism of jqueryUI(if there is one) which is triggered every time another suggestion is in the focus, preferably with databinding so I can easyly extract the related data
[09:22:26] <duch_kazatel> experimenting is fine, but things like what you've got are very difficult to use.
[09:23:18] <duch_kazatel> sw33tlull4by huh?  if I understand you correctly, i'd end up binding to keyboard events and seeing which suggestion has the "active" (or whatever) class, then going from there.
[09:23:20] <DansVC> I know, but is like a copy of Dolphin Browser, and there it was fine
[09:23:21] <jop008> colum toggle on a table it seems random behaviour the incorrect columns are shown up
[09:23:58] <DansVC> duch_kazatel the button in the bottom dont appears the images?
[09:24:14] <DansVC> or you cannot click in that images?
[09:24:24] <duch_kazatel> DansVC desktop web browsers are not a great place for gestures.  and the icon in the bottom left glitched out.
[09:24:39] <duch_kazatel> the icons came out once, then when I moved my mouse to try and click an icon, they went away, then never came back.
[09:24:52] <DansVC> you have to move the R image
[09:25:03] <DansVC> to the icons that happens :s
[09:25:14] <DansVC> I know is a little complicate :s
[09:25:21] <duch_kazatel> DansVC there shouldn't be "rules" about how things like that work.
[09:25:38] <duch_kazatel> as a general guide, it should "just work".  it should be as frictionless as possible.
[09:25:50] <duch_kazatel> that means not having things get complicated.
[09:25:59] <DansVC> ok
[09:26:01] <decx> but what's the point of the green line svg drawing?
[09:26:04] <decx> i don't get it
[09:26:22] <duch_kazatel> decx so you can click/drag/release in a direction.
[09:26:24] <DansVC> thx duch_kazatel
[09:26:30] <duch_kazatel> and that navigates you somewhere.
[09:26:37] <decx> but it doesnt do anything
[09:26:38] <sw33tlull4by> duch_kazatel, yes querying for .active is one thing but I would still need to attach an eventlistener, and attaching this one is not really convenient when the element it should be attached to is either missing or removed all the time, that's why I am looking for a somewhat "cleaner" solution
[09:26:59] <decx> can't you attach that to the select function sw33tlull4by ?
[09:27:08] <duch_kazatel> sw33tlull4by then use event delegation.  or the select event.
[09:28:10] <EnlightenMental> best lib for swipe gestures ?
[09:28:26] <sw33tlull4by> ok will try thank you for the input duch_kazatel
[09:28:31] <duch_kazatel> EnlightenMental our team used hammer.js for that.
[09:29:32] <balance> hi
[09:29:47] <balance> i'm using 1.3.2, does this version not include parseJSON?
[09:30:03] <duch_kazatel> 1.3.2 of jquery?
[09:30:05] <duch_kazatel> that's ancient.
[09:30:15] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: You're generous...
[09:30:20] <systemfault> I'd say it's prehistoric
[09:30:42] <BinaryKitten> 5 years old
[09:31:12] <decx> IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM
[09:31:33] <BinaryKitten> decx nah
[09:31:45] <BinaryKitten> museum denotes it's worth keeping it around
[09:31:50] <BinaryKitten> just bin it and move on
[09:32:29] <balance> sry but I don't get the versioning of jquery, can you give me a link toa hosted jquery?
[09:32:54] <balance> ah I missread
[09:32:54] <duch_kazatel> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery
[09:33:17] <balance> thanks :)
[09:40:07] <balance> anyone used datatables with an ajax source and jquery 1.11?
[09:41:27] <lior> hey
[09:42:17] <lior> so I have this weird task, I need to sort an array by list of names, meaning if name ==a it should go first, if name ==b it should go last and everything else in the middle... how do I do that?
[09:42:37] <duch_kazatel> lior have a fiddle showing your data?
[09:42:39] <lior> and there can be multiple items with the same name
[09:42:42] <lior> ok
[09:42:46] <lior> one sec
[09:44:34] <lior> http://jsfiddle.net/WdZu3/ duch_kazatel - that is an example of it, and a needs to be first in the list and b last in the list
[09:45:16] <lior> I know I can do pop/push, but what about the ones in the middle... or do I make 3 separate arrays then add them together
[09:45:35] <duch_kazatel> what sort of browser support do you need?
[09:45:41] <lior> all
[09:45:46] <lior> ie
[09:45:51] <lior> can be the new version though
[09:46:02] <lior> the newer general version
[09:46:19] <duch_kazatel> generally, that question means "how far back do you need to support for all major browsers?" Is IE8 a concern?
[09:46:29] <duch_kazatel> or can it be 9 and above?
[09:46:39] <lior> 9 above should be fine
[09:46:39] <v0id3d> duch_kazatel, I was working on like a little plugin and I got it working with a little help but do you think you can look at the code and tell me if you think there is something I should do to make it better
[09:47:12] <duch_kazatel> lior check out using something like .map(), or some kind of manual iteration.
[09:47:24] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d sure.
[09:48:55] <v0id3d> http://jsfiddle.net/z62y7/
[09:49:40] <v0id3d> i was told tha ti should avoid using a for statement in the ajax success is this true?
[09:49:41] <lior> yeah duch_kazatel but with .map ... it goes through each one still
[09:49:54] <lior> how do I say keeps these at the end and these in the front
[09:50:49] <lior> oh
[09:51:03] <lior> I guess I can just say if it is b push it
[09:51:10] <lior> if it is a pop it
[09:51:14] <lior> and the others ignore right?>
[09:51:20] <systemfault> v0id3d: Don't know where you heard that.... but it's wrong.
[09:51:49] <v0id3d> I was told that it is better to use .each instead of for
[09:53:10] <systemfault> v0id3d: Seems like those arguments have nothing to support them.
[09:53:32] <jop008> why is there no alert on this fiddle?
[09:53:32] <systemfault> v0id3d: Sometimes $.each is better... other times a simple "for"
[09:53:34] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/nXyxS/58/
[09:53:53] <jop008> I try to reproduce an error in a fiddle
[09:54:04] <jop008> the odata is the server responnse
[09:54:05] <v0id3d> did you look in my fiddle?
[09:54:16] <systemfault> v0id3d: Just saw it.
[09:54:37] <v0id3d> is there something in that, that is just not good practice
[09:54:40] <sw33tlull4by> duch_kazatel, I'll soon  be off again after this just for the record, found what I was looking for: it's called the focus-event,
[09:54:54] <sw33tlull4by> should've read the specs a bit more in detail -.-
[09:55:04] <systemfault> v0id3d: Sure there is.
[09:55:15] <systemfault> v0id3d: rows is an array, right?
[09:55:22] <v0id3d> yes sir
[09:55:37] <systemfault> v0id3d: Never use for/in to iterate on arrays
[09:55:50] <systemfault> v0id3d: It's there to iterate of object properties
[09:56:05] <v0id3d> that maybe what they were telling me then
[09:56:23] <v0id3d> so i should use each in that route?
[09:56:26] <systemfault> v0id3d: Using it for arrays is 1) Slow 2) Order of iteration is not guaranteed 3) Might list other members that are enumerable.
[09:56:42] <systemfault> v0id3d: $.each would work just fine.
[09:56:57] <v0id3d> ok
[09:56:59] <systemfault> v0id3d: You got another anti-pattern in your code.
[09:57:29] <systemfault> v0id3d: Never .append in a loop, it's slow because it forces the page to repaint.
[09:57:59] <systemfault> append to a string... and at the end of the loop, do a single .append
[09:58:06] <systemfault> (with the string)
[09:59:08] <v0id3d> ok
[09:59:14] <v0id3d> so first thing is first loose the for
[09:59:18] <v0id3d> make it .each
[09:59:39] <v0id3d> Then i need to do one append vs 2
[09:59:46] <v0id3d> i mean vs in loops
[09:59:47] <v0id3d> haha
[09:59:47] <v0id3d> sorry
[10:01:08] <v0id3d> so like var markup += "the string"
[10:01:20] <lior> http://jsfiddle.net/WdZu3/1/ well that did not work
[10:01:29] <systemfault> v0id3d: Yes
[10:01:34] <lior> am I using append and prepend wrong
[10:01:34] <v0id3d> and out of the each loop do .append
[10:01:39] <systemfault> v0id3d: A bit like that http://jsfiddle.net/z62y7/1/
[10:01:47] <systemfault> (I might have made a type)
[10:01:50] <systemfault> *typo
[10:02:04] <systemfault> Right... 2x var row =
[10:02:31] <EnlightenMental> anyone familiar with adding swipe gestures and how it seems to prevent smooth vertical scrolling?
[10:02:53] <v0id3d> ok
[10:03:11] <v0id3d> haha just learning and want to make sure i am learning properly instead of doing it wrong
[10:03:31] <v0id3d> and clearly i was
[10:04:59] <duch_kazatel> sorry just got back.
[10:05:01] <v0id3d> line 20 what is var row = this; for?
[10:05:15] <lior> http://jsfiddle.net/WdZu3/2/ nice duch just in time
[10:05:20] <v0id3d> oh its cool systemfault is giving me the pointers on what i did wrong hahaha
[10:05:41] <inv3nt0r> Good afternoon from Canada everyone!
[10:05:43] <systemfault> v0id3d: the current row == 'this'
[10:06:08] <lior> systemfault I notice you were explaining append to him... how do I apply it to my array to move specific matching values to the end of an array
[10:06:10] <v0id3d> I have grown up to giving working code and optimizing it
[10:06:18] <v0id3d> yea but in the next line you re assign it
[10:06:31] <inv3nt0r> Having a bit of an issue with a script... For some reason it works correctly in Chrome / Safari / Firefox but not in IE. I don't see any script errors so I'm drawing a blank on this one...
[10:06:57] <systemfault> lior: What about just... using .sort with a predicate function?
[10:07:03] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[10:07:12] <duch_kazatel> i was drawing a blank on that one.
[10:07:17] <inv3nt0r> http://lyndonsecurity.com <--- Note the area toward the bottom which says: 1755 days since a list time injury... and counting
[10:07:17] <lior> what do you mean by predicate function
[10:07:27] <duch_kazatel> lior https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[10:07:39] <inv3nt0r> On most browsers, the script functions and the number counts up. On IE, no counting, no error.
[10:07:53] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r care to share the script?
[10:08:13] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: hold on for that...
[10:09:23] <DansVC> hi  Gmac_
[10:09:32] <Gmac_>  hi....
[10:09:42] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/5rvrjW6H
[10:09:44] <lior> yeah duch which one explains it not in alphabetical order... and it says on the bottom to use map...
[10:09:44] <DansVC> :D
[10:09:48] <v0id3d> systemfault, am i reading it wrong? I am pretty sure tho line 21 kills line 20
[10:10:17] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: <span data-startquantity="1555" data-quantity="1755" class="sc-quantity">1755</span>
[10:10:18] <lior> there is no great than or less than it is just if it equals this move to the front how do I say that in jquery
[10:10:35] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: That is the HTML which (should) be affected by the jQuery
[10:10:40] <lior> I know I can call a pop then unshift ... but is there something easier in jquery to just "prepend it"
[10:10:46] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r create a fiddle./
[10:10:53] <lior> and etc for the end of the array
[10:10:56] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: OK. Hold on...
[10:10:58] <DansVC> inv3nt0r i dont know what is the problem but you can use .data("...") instead of .attr("data-...")
[10:14:53] <systemfault> v0id3d: I said I had typos/errors in my paste ;)
[10:15:00] <v0id3d> oh ok
[10:15:03] <v0id3d> just making sure hahaha
[10:15:27] <v0id3d> not criticizing just ensuring that it was not intentional
[10:15:54] <v0id3d> so note to self no for loop with arrays
[10:15:58] <jop008> Can someone take a look at this page http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm if you toggle colums weid behaviour
[10:16:08] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d at least, no for...in loops
[10:16:08] <lior> easy
[10:16:14] <lior> found it finally
[10:16:23] <lior> http://jsfiddle.net/WdZu3/3/
[10:16:27] <lior> if you guys are interested
[10:17:06] <inv3nt0r> Here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Bdc5R/
[10:17:38] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r you said it's broken in IE?  which version?
[10:17:50] <inv3nt0r> DansVC: Thanks, I didn't write the code but I will keep that in mind. You don't think that would throw an error in IE for some reason though?
[10:18:08] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Well I can't get it to work on 8, and the client can't get it to work on 11
[10:18:20] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: You know what... I think I know what is going on......
[10:18:29] <duch_kazatel> ?
[10:18:39] <systemfault> v0id3d: So, is everything good?
[10:18:43] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: My colleague put in some conditional IE stuff and I'll bet it is not running a required script...
[10:18:52] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[10:19:00] <v0id3d> i am re writing it find that typing it helps more then the whole copy and paste
[10:19:02] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Hard for me to debug as I'm on Linux and IE runs very poorly on this machine :)
[10:19:21] <v0id3d> but logically it seems to be sound
[10:19:32] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r microsoft supplies virtual machines for you to test IE with.
[10:19:56] <duch_kazatel> you should just be able to use those images.
[10:20:12] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Oh? I've been using 'play on linux' to run IE but I'm glad to know there is a (possibly better) alternative
[10:21:09] <joord> inv3nt0r: http://modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads
[10:21:37] <inv3nt0r> joord: Downloading now... this should make my life easier (I hope)
[10:21:38] <systemfault> v0id3d: Great :) Another small thing... learn to use the promise-based interface of $.ajax instead of setting the callback in the config
[10:21:52] <systemfault> v0id3d: A lot more flexible... and it might help you in the future.
[10:21:53] <DansVC> inv3nt0r your code breack my IE kk
[10:22:01] <v0id3d> what do you mean
[10:22:08] <inv3nt0r> DansVC: I'm sure it does :)
[10:22:12] <DansVC> Now i dont can close it kk
[10:23:21] <inv3nt0r> DansVC: I wrote a script once that would crash IE without fail... I'm not sure how I could possibly have written code so bad that it would force kill the program but it did LOL
[10:23:35] <inv3nt0r> DansVC: Looks like I've written a second piece of code to crash it...
[10:24:19] <systemfault> v0id3d: Like this http://jsfiddle.net/z62y7/2/
[10:24:22] <v0id3d> ok so i used r in rows in my for loop
[10:24:45] <v0id3d> thats how i went through the array
[10:24:51] <v0id3d> with combo name and value
[10:24:53] <systemfault> v0id3d: See how I got rid of the itemCount variable
[10:24:55] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r it didn't crash IE for me.
[10:25:12] <systemfault> v0id3d: See the .done(callback) ?
[10:25:22] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Any warnings which would indicate why it doesn't count? Or does the fiddle count properly?
[10:25:32] <v0id3d> ok gotcha
[10:25:43] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r i'm getting the vinal result of the count.  let me look again.
[10:25:50] <v0id3d> i see where you are comming from
[10:26:09] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Thanks a bunch. Will be another hour before I have this VM downloaded...
[10:26:37] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r if I use the jquery 1.11 reference in that fiddle, instead of 10, everything works as expected in IE 11.
[10:27:13] <duch_kazatel> dropping all the way back to 9, things work fine.  fiddle doesn't appear to support 8.
[10:27:32] <v0id3d> so you call the function on .done instead of success
[10:27:46] <v0id3d> and you madefunction pass index
[10:27:51] <v0id3d> and add 1
[10:28:57] <systemfault> v0id3d: Right.
[10:28:59] <v0id3d> would index++ work in that?
[10:29:23] <systemfault> v0id3d: Not really because index is updated at every iteration
[10:29:28] <v0id3d> ok
[10:29:30] <v0id3d> got you
[10:29:43] <v0id3d> wait no i dont
[10:29:45] <v0id3d> hahaha
[10:30:23] <v0id3d> so index is being updated each iteration with index++ same as index + 1 tho
[10:30:39] <systemfault> v0id3d: Why do you need the side-effect of ++?
[10:30:50] <systemfault> (You don't)
[10:31:12] <lior> ok found a flaw
[10:31:15] <v0id3d> instead of the (index + 1)
[10:31:33] <lior> http://jsfiddle.net/WdZu3/4/ apparently the first spot is not turning out incorrect
[10:31:36] <lior> any reason why?
[10:31:39] <v0id3d> i know i am retarded hahaha
[10:31:39] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Interesting
[10:31:56] <systemfault> v0id3d: index + 1 is pure... it has no side-effect. index++ increases the variable by 1, you don't need that.
[10:31:56] <lior> correct*
[10:32:01] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: I will try calling the 1.11 library on the website and see if that repairs it...
[10:32:13] <v0id3d> oh i got u
[10:32:17] <v0id3d> ok ok
[10:32:19] <v0id3d> i see it now
[10:32:20] <v0id3d> hahha
[10:32:30] <v0id3d> i didnt see it before but now i got you
[10:33:03] <v0id3d> index will be increminted each time it goes to the .each so incrimenting  with ++ changes it by 2
[10:33:12] <duch_kazatel> huh>
[10:33:21] <duch_kazatel> oh, hah.
[10:33:26] <v0id3d> index + 1 just does the math with out assigning it to index
[10:33:58] <systemfault> v0id3d: Right, index++ is a useless assignment
[10:34:05] <lior> http://jsfiddle.net/WdZu3/4/ anyone : /
[10:34:29] <lior> how do i fix that first one... i am assuming because it has nothing to sort it against?
[10:38:50] <v0id3d> ok and can you do me a favor
[10:39:00] <v0id3d> why did we walk away from success and use .done
[10:39:11] <v0id3d> the purpose of that ?
[10:39:13] <duch_kazatel> because promises are awesome.
[10:39:23] <lior> duch any ideas?
[10:39:25] <v0id3d> hahaha
[10:39:29] <v0id3d> fair enough
[10:39:40] <lior> I tried to specify the index but that just puts the whole thing in wack
[10:39:42] <duch_kazatel> lior sorry got pulled into work stuff =/.
[10:39:49] <lior> ah kk
[10:40:06] <lior> thanks
[10:40:23] <lior> anyone else here that might be able to help me square away my sort... the first index is just screwing me up
[10:40:24] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d but seriously, check out promises/deferreds.  they're much cleaner than the old way.
[10:44:45] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: I sorta fixed the issue, looks to be a problem with the is_visible() function
[10:44:58] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r interesting.
[10:45:39] <v0id3d> ok
[10:45:51] <v0id3d> i will read though it and see whats going on with it
[10:46:04] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: I can live with my fix for now, basically I just let the counter start counting on page load instead of when the counter is visible. Not what I'd like necessarily but it will do.
[10:46:43] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r sometimes that's the sacrifice we need to make ;)
[10:47:14] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: I'm sure it will make the client happy, they were more concerned that the number as inaccurate than the fact that it wasn't counting up :)
[10:47:21] <inv3nt0r> as = was
[10:47:31] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r good.  sounds like they're reasonable then!
[10:48:12] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Look at the guy on the home page slide show with the moustache... he looks reasonable to me ;)
[10:49:24] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: In all seriousness they have been a great client to work with. I think the site came out well overall but then there are these types of bugs that can drive a man to insanity. I'm sure you guys hear this a lot but, eff IE!
[10:49:42] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r i actually rarely have issues with IE, but that's me.
[10:51:43] <jop008> Can someone ackknowledge that togglecolumn has error in 1.3.2? See this page http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm the wrong collumns are hidden
[10:51:54] <duch_kazatel> jop008 in 1.3.2 of what?
[10:52:03] <jop008> jquery mobile
[10:52:39] <jop008> To convert to the latest version is triggy I saw a number of bugs firing
[10:53:10] <jop008> So I would be real happy if this could be fixed in 1.3.2
[10:53:20] <jop008> jquery 1.9,1
[10:53:38] <v0id3d> so i have one more question that perhaps you can assist me with
[10:54:44] <v0id3d> is there a way that I can just place the actual php code in the ajax statement instead of creating a new php for each of my statements?
[10:55:03] <drej> wat
[10:55:06] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:55:16] <duch_kazatel> sounds like somebody needs some abstraction./
[10:56:41] <v0id3d> $.ajax({type:'POST', url: 'scripts/combo.php' data:'', dataType:'json'}) is how it is now is there a way to do like <?php ........
[10:57:32] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:57:34] <v0id3d> or should i just pass variables to the file and call it good
[10:57:44] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what you're asking.
[10:57:51] <v0id3d> i have noticed
[10:58:17] <v0id3d> ok i dont want 50 independent php files in my scripts dir
[10:58:35] <v0id3d> especially for less then 10 lines of code
[10:58:55] <duch_kazatel> php has classes doesn't it?  couldn't you write a class and call different methods on that?
[10:59:18] <v0id3d> so is there a way that i can insert the php into the ajax command or is it better just to send arguments ?
[10:59:37] <duch_kazatel> don't dynamically generate javascript.
[10:59:46] <duch_kazatel> unless it's data.  send args.
[10:59:51] <v0id3d> gotcha
[10:59:59] <v0id3d> that was what the question was hahaha
[11:00:00] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you'll wind up with a terrible mess.
[11:04:07] <v0id3d> ok so i am going to create a handler in my php
[11:04:12] <v0id3d> thanks so much guys
[11:05:52] <v0id3d> as always you guys have been more then helpful
[11:06:05] <v0id3d> i got my new reading
[11:08:21] <jop008> Can someone explain the console message unexpected string of this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/kkppd/31/  it is on line 61
[11:09:14] <duch_kazatel> jop008 $(this).jqmData("cells", $("#table").find.("tr").children(sel)); <- see the issue?
[11:10:21] <duch_kazatel> specifically, this: $("#table").find.("tr").children(sel)
[11:11:03] <jop008> No otherwise I wouldn't ask :-(
[11:11:15] <duch_kazatel> jop008 $("#table").find.("tr") isn't a thing.
[11:11:31] <jop008> a thing?
[11:11:46] <duch_kazatel> .find.("tr") <- this isn't what you wnat.
[11:11:49] <duch_kazatel> .find("tr") is.
[11:13:04] <jop008> what is miss with it? $("#table").find.("tr")
[11:13:29] <jop008> the dot
[11:13:37] <duch_kazatel> remove that extra dot.
[11:13:43] <duch_kazatel> dots are for object properties.
[11:13:46] <mikeche1en> find is a function()
[11:13:54] <duch_kazatel> you want to run the find method and pass it a string.
[11:13:57] <drej> a dot is not a funciont
[11:14:07] <drej> how'd that T move over like 3 letters
[11:14:39] <mikeche1en> magic!
[11:14:49] <duch_kazatel> ~*|magic|*~
[11:18:56] <mikeche1en> aka advanced technology
[11:19:31] <jop008> Any iadea why table hiding can go wrong?
[11:20:06] <jop008> If you give all the cells the same class you can do it yourself
[11:35:05] <SidGBF> is there a different channel for jquery ui / jquery mobile?
[11:35:14] <v0id3d> hey duch_kazatel not to bother you but jsfiddle.net/z62y7/2/
[11:35:42] <v0id3d> i can make line 10 read options = rite
[11:36:04] <v0id3d> no need for var options since options is declared in function at the top rite
[11:37:02] <fons1>  Hello. I have an issue with HTML elements appearing over my flash video on my site. I've played around with wmode parameter which is set window but can't seem to get the video to appear over HTML elements. This issue only happens in Chrome. Can someone help me pinpoint what CSS attribute is causing the video to not be layered over all elements. Link: https://www.mybuildingbuddy.com/video/clo
[11:37:02] <fons1> setmaid/bedroom/closetmaid-9-cube-organizer
[11:38:26] <duch_kazatel> let me look, v0id3d
[11:39:15] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d do you just want to use whatever was passed to the function for options?
[11:39:41] <duch_kazatel> because if so, drop the var declaraion.
[11:39:55] <v0id3d> ok
[11:40:08] <jop008> how to trap the click in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/kkppd/36/ I want to trap the key of the column toggle
[11:40:08] <v0id3d> because i will be
[11:40:31] <duch_kazatel> "trap the click" -0 jop008 huh?
[11:40:42] <gnarf> SidGBF: nope - all jQuery support, UI and Mobile are in #jquery
[11:40:46] <jop008> but on what element?
[11:40:56] <duch_kazatel> jop008 what do you mean "trap"
[11:41:05] <jop008> event happens
[11:41:15] <duch_kazatel> you want to stop the event?
[11:41:39] <jop008> no I want to got the event and do something
[11:41:50] <SidGBF> gnarf: Thanks :) I wanna learn jquery mobile... Im picking some tutorials, do you have any hot tip?
[11:42:38] <jop008> work hard things look EZ but later on you will notice a lot of small issues you will encounter
[11:43:02] <duch_kazatel> jop008 use .on()
[11:43:15] <jop008> on on what element?
[11:43:36] <duch_kazatel> jop008 that's for you to figure out.
[11:43:48] <duch_kazatel> $(target).on('event', function(){});
[11:43:50] <jop008> and that I couldn;t find
[11:44:02] <duch_kazatel> or $(parent).on('event', 'target', function(){});
[11:44:09] <jop008> used many times
[11:44:11] <duch_kazatel> jop008 how would i know which element?  it's your code?
[11:44:21] <jop008> No it is jqm code
[11:44:21] <duch_kazatel> you should know.
[11:44:28] <duch_kazatel> then inspect?
[11:44:33] <jop008> Grabbed from the console
[11:44:37] <duch_kazatel> use firebug/firefox's dev tools/chrome.
[11:44:45] <jop008> I did inspect and copied html
[11:44:57] <duch_kazatel> is there an ID on the HTML you want to target?
[11:45:13] <jop008> No otherwise live was simpel
[11:45:22] <duch_kazatel> don't use .live().  it's deprecated.
[11:45:26] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want to replace .live()?
[11:45:37] <jop008> live as live
[11:45:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:45:57] <jop008> a live
[11:46:02] <jop008> life
[11:46:19] <jop008> but long story short no help
[11:46:26] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what you're saying.
[11:47:08] <SidGBF> About jquery mobile: 1) Any good tutorial you suggest? (at this moment Ill use learn.jquery and w3schools); 2) jQuery Mobile is supposed to be used with phonegap?
[11:47:28] <mikeche1en> w3schools is a good place to start
[11:47:47] <jop008> this one $(".ui-btn-inner").on("click",function(){ no success
[11:47:49] <duch_kazatel> actually, w3schools is a pretty bad reference.
[11:47:59] <duch_kazatel> they're often inaccurate/wrong.
[11:48:12] <duch_kazatel> jop008 is .ui-btn-inner getting dynamically added to the page?
[11:48:25] <duch_kazatel> !g w3fools
[11:48:26] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: W3Fools  A W3Schools Intervention  http://www.w3fools.com/
[11:49:32] <SidGBF> b-ot: do you have any suggestion of tutorial?
[11:49:32] <b-ot> SidGBF: ask again later.
[11:49:32] <jop008> found it
[11:49:39] <duch_kazatel> b-ot is a bot.
[11:49:43] <SidGBF> lol
[11:49:57] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-mobile/getting-started/ is a great place to start.
[11:50:08] <duch_kazatel> that and the api docs, as well as mdn are three fantastic resources.
[11:52:47] <SidGBF> duch_kazatel: I was going to blame about this link being short, but, http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/ is way more detailed
[11:53:33] <SidGBF> duch_kazatel: my last doubt is about phone gap. Do jquery expect me to use PhoneGap or it actually helps me to builg my own "shell"?
[11:53:50] <duch_kazatel> SidGBF huh?
[11:53:57] <duch_kazatel> jquery doesn't require phonegap.
[11:54:14] <duch_kazatel> phonegap is a way to build apps for mobile phones using html/css/javascript.
[11:55:16] <SidGBF> duch_kazatel: so jquery mobile MAY be used with jQuery Mobile, but jQuery doesn't require phonegap. I can code all communitaction (os <-> js) my self?!
[11:55:27] <duch_kazatel> SidGBF huh?
[11:55:57] <duch_kazatel> SidGBF i think you're confused - what are you trying to do.
[11:55:58] <duch_kazatel> ?
[11:56:29] <SidGBF> duch_kazatel: to have an android app with jquery mobile, I have to build up a basic app with a browser to load my html/css/js right?
[11:56:50] <duch_kazatel> jquery is a library for web browsers.  jquery mobile is a library that makes building mobiles sites easier.  phonegap is a way to build apps using html, css, and javascript.
[11:57:06] <duch_kazatel> if you want to build an app using html/css/javascript, then phonegap is one way to do that.
[11:57:55] <SidGBF> duch_kazatel: So jquery mobile is for SITES not for APPS, is that it?!
[11:58:26] <duch_kazatel> SidGBF you're confused.  if you're using phonegap, you're creating a site that will run like an app.
[11:58:45] <duch_kazatel> you can use jquery mobile within phonegap as far as I'm aware.  but it is not required.
[11:58:56] <SidGBF> duch_kazatel: indeed Im confused and I want to clear that :)
[11:59:20] <duch_kazatel> phonegap takes a "site" you've built and turns it into an app, basically.
[12:00:09] <SidGBF> duch_kazatel: Im working on android development right now. Now I want to get the app I made and create another version, using HTML/CSS/JS to compare the technologies and the ease of development.
[12:00:51] <SidGBF> SidGBF: My plan was to create a basic app that is only a browser. This browser would load my html/css/js that would be made only in jquery mobile.
[12:00:58] <SidGBF> duch_kazatel: My plan was to create a basic app that is only a browser. This browser would load my html/css/js that would be made only in jquery mobile.
[12:01:20] <duch_kazatel> SidGBF that's what phonegap does for you, then.
[12:01:46] <duch_kazatel> all right, lunchtime,.
[12:01:47] <duch_kazatel> bbiab
[12:03:06] <gnarf> SidGBF: phonegap takes a "site" and turns it into an "app" - jquerymobile helps you develop a "site" that has a similar UI to most mobile "apps"
[12:04:17] <SidGBF> gnarf: so I can, instead of using phone gap, create a browser app, load my jquery mobile htmls and run everything as I want. It isn't required _exactly_ phonegap
[12:04:49] <gnarf> phonegap makes the "app" - without that, you'd just browse in chrome to your jquerymobile site
[12:05:15] <gnarf> phonegap also gives you access to more hardware stuff than standard web browser
[12:05:47] <SidGBF> gnarf: Ok, now finally I got it. It was kinda what I expected :p
[12:11:18] <fatalhalt> is $(function() {} same as $(window).load(function () {} or $(document).ready(function() {} ???
[12:11:45] <decx> it's the same as document ready
[12:12:01] <decx> but window load is later when all assets on the pages like iamges are loaded as well
[12:12:32] <fatalhalt> decx: thanks i couldn't remember it
[12:28:56] <jop008> I use this col = $("table tr th:nth-child("+id+"), table tr td:nth-child("+id+")"); to hide the 3rd column but only the header cell is hidden not the column
[12:45:16] <nhulea> hello?
[12:46:02] <duch_kazatel> hello
[12:53:37] <fels_zh> hi
[12:53:40] <fels_zh> anyone use OWL - Carousel
[12:54:00] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ fels_zh
[12:54:00] <b-ot> fels_zh: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:55:00] <fels_zh> using owl - carousal  I wanted to stop the image MID - WAY  how would I do that . so I don't want the image to stick to the left edge after swipe I want it to stay in the middle showing a bit of the previous and a bit of the next image
[12:56:51] <duch_kazatel> have a fiddle, fels?
[13:01:26] <kvendrik> Hey Everyone :)
[13:02:06] <duch_kazatel> good afternoon.
[13:02:06] <bberry> if i have <div id="test"><img src="stuff"/></div> and i did $("#test").on("click", function(){ blah }); how could i change the img source programmatically?
[13:02:22] <duch_kazatel> bberry that HTML isn't correct btw.
[13:02:46] <bberry> eh, it gets my question acorss
[13:03:08] <kvendrik> $("#test").on("click", function(){ $(this).attr('src', '[SOURCE LINK]') });
[13:03:22] <duch_kazatel> kvendrik text is the div, not the img :)
[13:03:32] <kvendrik> oopsie haah
[13:03:35] <duch_kazatel> you could do $("#test").on("click", function(){ $(this).find('img').attr('src') });
[13:03:46] <bberry> could i use children()?
[13:03:50] <kvendrik> exactly ;)
[13:04:03] <duch_kazatel> children is actually slower than .find() in many cases.
[13:04:08] <bberry> kk
[13:04:19] <duch_kazatel> do you expect to have a lot of img tags as children of divs you're clicking on?
[13:04:27] <duch_kazatel> also - why not simply have the event hander on the image?
[13:04:46] <bberry> duch_kazatel: the event handler is doing a good bit of stuff
[13:04:54] <bberry> duch_kazatel: other than change the image
[13:05:16] <bberry> duch_kazatel: and theres a bunch of these
[13:05:25] <bberry> well... 5
[13:05:37] <bberry> a handful i guess :P
[13:05:50] <duch_kazatel> wait all bound on the same event, or...?
[13:06:12] <bberry> all selected by my selector for the event
[13:06:19] <bberry> so yes
[13:06:19] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:06:32] <duch_kazatel> so you have multiple click handers for the same click event?
[13:06:35] <duch_kazatel> why not bind one handler?
[13:06:50] <bberry> no im saying it is one click handler :P
[13:06:59] <duch_kazatel> you said you have 5 bound.
[13:07:00] <duch_kazatel> i'm lost.
[13:07:06] <bberry> 1 handler, 5 images
[13:07:11] <duch_kazatel> ah, okay
[13:07:51] <bberry> haha, i should be more clear/concise i guess :P
[13:10:45] <aracodex123> hey guys, what's the best practice to focus on the newly created input element for meteor? document.getElementById(newNodeId).focus() doesn't work because it takes a render to see the new node
[13:11:16] <MrJones_> hi
[13:11:27] <MrJones_> how can I change the active link color _without_ using addClass & CSS
[13:11:30] <MrJones_> I want to do it in pure js
[13:11:50] <duch_kazatel> MrJones_ the "pure js" would edit the css.
[13:11:54] <MrJones_> yes
[13:12:01] <MrJones_> however, css("color", "white") doesn't work for somer eason
[13:12:10] <MrJones_> I think the :active and :visited stuff is probably overriding it?
[13:12:23] <duch_kazatel> then change your stylesheets?
[13:12:29] <MrJones_> yes that is what I meant
[13:12:34] <MrJones_> I want to do this in the js code, not in the style sheets
[13:12:47] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible idea, but .css() would be the jquery method do to it.
[13:14:37] <MrJones_> so is there a way I can address the :visited or :any-link css subclasses of an object? I have no idea how to do that :x
[13:14:54] <MrJones_> would I just append that to the jQuery selector where I have the element's id right now?
[13:15:30] <decx> you can't style pseudo classes like :hover, :active, :visited with inline css
[13:16:04] <kvendrik> >MrJones_  I want to do it in pure js
[13:16:10] <kvendrik> Why would you want that?
[13:16:35] <decx> $('body').append('<style>a:visited { color: grey }</style>') :p
[13:17:07] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[13:17:21] <duch_kazatel> MrJones_ edit your css.  otherwise you're in for a world of hurt.
[13:19:59] <fons1> Hello. I'm having trouble figuring out why my swf video doesn't appear over my HTML in Chrome. Site: https://www.mybuildingbuddy.com/video/closetmaid/bedroom/closetmaid-9-cube-organizer
[13:23:05] <duch_kazatel> wow, surprising how many plugins used .browser
[13:32:50] <systemfault> Well... that's what you get when millions of bad JS developpers write plugins...
[13:33:02] <duch_kazatel> truthg
[13:33:04] <duch_kazatel> *truth
[13:55:15] <zizzl> Hey guys, I am doing a handful of .append'ing to a div, but each time I do it, I'd like to clear the contents of that div before, whats the best method
[14:00:03] <NoiseEee> zizzl: why?
[14:00:04] <duch_kazatel> zizzl you mean you want to replace the contents of a div?
[14:00:17] <zizzl> duch_kazatel yes
[14:00:34] <duch_kazatel> well i mean there's http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[14:01:55] <mikeche1en> with jquery mobile how do i make a footer that shows on multiple pages?
[14:03:13] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, well divs are being appended in loop so I can't do that because each will replace the previous.. I just want the entire batch to replace
[14:03:34] <codechewing> zizzl: $('div').empty()
[14:03:43] <zizzl> thanks
[14:05:04] <NoiseEee> zizzl: wait, you're adding something to the div, emptying it, then appending something else, etc etc?
[14:05:11] <NoiseEee> like adding/empty/adding/empty?
[14:05:15] <zizzl> no...
[14:05:17] <NoiseEee> ok
[14:05:18] <zizzl> nvm I got it
[14:15:48] <decx> you should look into document fragments so you don't have to repaint 6 times for every append in a loop
[14:16:24] <duch_kazatel> yessss
[14:16:29] <duch_kazatel> one of my favorite things.
[14:17:45] <decx> what happened to the guy that wanted to use css without css earlier? i missed the conclusion
[14:18:02] <duch_kazatel> there was none.  he died.
[14:18:04] <duch_kazatel> CLIFFHANGER
[14:18:06] <decx> good
[14:19:40] <mikeche1en> with jquery mobile, how can i have a search bar at the top that persists across multiple pages?
[14:27:21] <logikos> i'm using a jqueryui slider that is linked to a selectbox like in one of the examples on the site. but i also have an on change event linked to the selectbox, when the slider is moved it uses select[0].selectedIndex=uivalue -1;  to chnage the value of the selectbox however that does not trigger the on change event for the selectbox
[14:27:31] <logikos> i want something to happen when the value of the selectbox is changed
[14:28:03] <logikos> example i followed is here: https://jqueryui.com/slider/#hotelrooms
[14:28:27] <logikos> i realize there is a change event in there for the selectbox to update the slider and i dont want an infinate loop...
[14:28:56] <NoiseEee> logikos: events are really for people.  you could .trigger('change'), but i'd imagine the jqueryui slider offers some events for you to bind to,and you should use those instead
[14:29:21] <NoiseEee> logikos: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-change
[14:29:34] <NoiseEee> fire what you need from there
[14:29:40] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[14:29:43] <Bloomberg> why this is empty
[14:29:44] <Bloomberg> <a class="trash"><i class="icon-credit-card"></i></a>
[14:29:56] <Bloomberg> I already load the script of bootstrap
[14:32:49] <drej> ...
[14:32:58] <drej> why are you asking in #jquery about bootstrap html?
[14:33:16] <duch_kazatel> because they're all ready here - duh.
[14:33:35] <Bloomberg> maybe someone know it!
[14:44:08] * kuldeepdhaka is away: I'm busy
[14:50:36] <DansVC> Hi everyone :d
[14:50:42] <DansVC> Hi everyone :D
[14:53:07] <DansVC> someone need help?
[14:53:30] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:53:59] <mikeche1en> anyone know a good jquery mobile example of a search form with submit button on one line?
[14:54:14] <DansVC> duch_kazatel do you still here :o
[14:54:22] <duch_kazatel> do i still here?
[14:54:23] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:54:42] <DansVC> steal (I'm noob with english :s)
[14:55:01] <duch_kazatel> that still doesn't make sense.
[14:55:18] <DansVC> continue...
[14:55:33] <duch_kazatel> do you mean "are you still here?"
[14:55:39] <DansVC> yes
[14:55:48] <decx> looks like it
[14:55:59] <decx> you, writing and all that
[14:56:01] <DansVC> so i'm not so wrong :s
[14:56:01] <duch_kazatel> "steal" is something thieves do.  and yes I am.  i hang out in here while I'm at work.
[14:56:23] <duch_kazatel> "do you" is incorrect - "are you" is the right way to put it.
[14:56:40] <DansVC> are you english?
[14:56:46] <duch_kazatel> American.
[14:57:02] <DansVC> American Football or Basketball?
[14:57:06] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:57:14] <duch_kazatel> are you asking if I like either sport?
[14:57:36] <DansVC> which do you like most
[14:57:37] <DansVC> ?
[14:58:28] <duch_kazatel> neither.  i'm not very into most sports.
[14:58:50] <DansVC> but you have a favourite team?
[14:59:45] <duch_kazatel> I always like the Scottish Rugby team personally.
[14:59:48] <duch_kazatel> *liked
[15:00:41] <DansVC> Rugby :o why not football?
[15:00:54] <duch_kazatel> american football?  i've always found it kind of boring.
[15:01:18] <DansVC> yeah, it stops a lot
[15:01:22] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[15:01:39] <duch_kazatel> in rugby, they just keep going.  they don't ruin the pace.  the ball hitting the ground isn't some momentous event./
[15:02:15] <DansVC> :D
[15:02:53] <duch_kazatel> college football is a bit better than the NFL, but still prefer rugby
[15:04:46] <DansVC> I never play rugby or Am. football
[15:06:43] <duch_kazatel> i'm much more into music personally./
[15:07:05] <DansVC> what kind of music?
[15:07:25] <duch_kazatel> all kinds.  mostly blues and rock but i'm currently in a band that covers anything 80's
[15:09:59] <DansVC> duch_kazatel, how many summers have you lived?
[15:10:17] <duch_kazatel> how many summers?
[15:10:23] <duch_kazatel> uh... wat?
[15:10:30] <DansVC> its a way to say
[15:10:35] <DansVC> How old are you?
[15:10:40] <decx> i knew it, he's an elf
[15:10:43] <duch_kazatel> i'm turning 27 in less than a month.
[15:11:03] <DansVC> nice :)
[15:11:20] <duch_kazatel> it'll be an interesting year.
[15:12:00] <DansVC> duch_kazatel I have to play a game so good bye ;)
[15:12:03] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[15:12:20] <DansVC> thx ;)
[15:12:29] <duch_kazatel> well that was interesting.
[15:24:01] <mikeche1en> anyone know a good jquery mobile demo of a search form with submit button on one line?
[15:28:12] <duch_kazatel> mikeche1en https://forum.jquery.com/topic/text-field-inline-with-submit-button
[15:28:20] <duch_kazatel> the first answer.
[15:31:27] <mikeche1en> duch_kazatel: the problem is the search input field and submit buttons come out different sizes
[15:33:40] <duch_kazatel> everything says to use the grid system, a table-based system, or some floats.
[15:34:37] <mikeche1en> yeah i am using grids
[15:34:48] <mikeche1en> i guess it comes down to the css for the elements
[15:35:29] <duch_kazatel> yup
[15:39:12] <mikeche1en> i can't figure out which elements to restyle
[15:39:52] <vxitch> im having an issue where my element loses sight of its parent and siblings inside a callback --> http://laravel.io/bin/PJoz
[15:40:25] <vxitch> i never get to see 'aye' and i've tried replacing $(this) with li but that has the same effect
[15:41:12] <vxitch> why does this happen and how can i get around it? additionally, is there a better way to trigger an event when the last item in a list has been removed?
[15:41:29] <duch_kazatel> you're removing the thing.  cache the parent beforehand and go from there.
[15:41:53] <vxitch> duch_kazatel: wow, i must be really tired. hahaha thanks!
[15:41:59] <duch_kazatel> of course ;0
[15:42:00] <duch_kazatel> *;)
[15:42:19] <vxitch> is this the best way to do something when the last item in a list is gone?
[15:42:48] <duch_kazatel> no idea what your UX is - is there a change you'd add things back to the list?
[15:43:07] <duch_kazatel> err, *chance
[15:44:36] <vxitch> yeah so what im trying to do is when i click the X button on the last item in the list, i'd like there to be a "No items" item present
[15:46:23] <vxitch> and of course, when i add an item to the list (theres an input on the page that allows this), i want the "no items" one to disappear
[15:46:26] <nhulea> hey is there a way to remove a blank space when checking data ?
[15:46:44] <nhulea> say I have an input that needs to check for a correct answer
[15:46:49] <vxitch> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_trim_string.asp
[15:46:58] <duch_kazatel> no w3school
[15:47:05] <duch_kazatel> !g w3fools
[15:47:05] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: W3Fools  A W3Schools Intervention  http://www.w3fools.com/
[15:47:26] <vxitch> my bad, i stay away from it too but it was the first result on google for 'js trim' :)
[15:47:50] <vxitch> nhulea: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim
[15:48:07] <nhulea> vxitch: awesome thanks!
[15:48:08] <duch_kazatel> be aware string.trim() doesn't exist in IE8.
[15:48:13] <duch_kazatel> $.trim() works, too.
[15:48:58] <nhulea> ok cool I will try it out looks like thanks for the quick response
[15:49:10] <nhulea> I am not a w3fool by the way
[15:49:12] <nhulea> haha
[15:52:18] <nhulea> whoa major hate for w3schools
[15:52:21] <nhulea> haha
[15:53:00] <duch_kazatel> it's a terrible site.
[15:54:18] <nhulea> yeah seriously its always confused me
[15:56:19] <vxitch> how can i make it so event listeners (click) hook on dynamically added elements?
[15:56:30] <duch_kazatel> event delegation.
[15:57:01] <duch_kazatel> bind to a parent that exists on pageload - $(parent).on('click', 'child', function(){});
[15:57:46] <vxitch> see, i did that, but it still only affects the ones that exist on page load
[15:58:00] <vxitch>  $('body').on('click', '#existing-groups button.close', function() {
[15:58:01] <duch_kazatel> then your parent is getting replacted.
[15:58:04] <duch_kazatel> *replaced
[15:59:03] <duch_kazatel> or you have something stopping propagation.
[15:59:10] <vxitch> i doubt body is being replaced. any other reasons clicking on the new elements' close buttons isnt doing anything?
[15:59:35] <duch_kazatel> propagation is getting stopped.
[15:59:44] <duch_kazatel> your selector is wrong
[16:01:54] <vxitch> does propagation treat selectors any differently than usual? do i need to be extra specific? in my example ^ i could be even more specific by doing 'ul#existing-groups li button.close', but i omitted the li in between
[16:02:10] <duch_kazatel> propagation stops the event from bubbling.
[16:02:24] <duch_kazatel> so the delegated listener wouldn't work.
[16:03:17] <vxitch> i dont know what that means (propagation stops the event from bubbling, delegated listener), can you explain or point me to an article?
[16:03:55] <duch_kazatel> http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate
[16:04:08] <duch_kazatel> are you calling .stopPropagation() on any events?
[16:04:13] <vxitch> nope
[16:04:21] <duch_kazatel> then that likely isn't your problem.
[16:04:27] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see your code.
[16:05:50] <vxitch> if you have a moment and would be willing to look through it i can msg you the code
[16:05:57] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it.
[16:06:02] <duch_kazatel> don't pm it to me.
[16:06:15] <vxitch> i mean pm you the link to fiddle
[16:06:17] <vxitch> :P
[16:06:20] <duch_kazatel> uh, why?
[16:06:25] <duch_kazatel> defeats the purpose of the channel.
[16:06:54] <vxitch> internal app, boss doesnt want it public. it's not very identifiable code, but still
[16:07:06] <duch_kazatel> uh, sure?
[16:07:12] <vxitch> thanks
[16:19:00] <zizzl> Hey guys prob soemthing super easy but why isn't his working https://gist.github.com/zjherm/8b5592fc9dbbdde49063
[16:19:04] <zizzl> something
[16:20:02] <zizzl> also tried $('.close-btn).on('click', function(){ console.log("closing"); });
[16:20:54] <duch_kazatel> zizzl because you're not waiting until document ready.
[16:21:13] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, hmm I tried that but let me try again
[16:21:30] <duch_kazatel> or put your javascript after your html.
[16:21:32] <zizzl> just wrap it in $(document).ready(function {code}); right?
[16:22:03] <duch_kazatel> or just $(function(){ /* code */ });
[16:23:06] <duch_kazatel> brb
[16:24:30] <zizzl> waaaaait
[16:25:13] <zizzl> duch_kazatel I am doing a node app so that html is generated after page is loaded, even a second or two after.. is there a way to tackle this?
[16:26:13] <duch_kazatel> back
[16:26:18] <duch_kazatel> zizzl huh?
[16:26:23] <duch_kazatel> are you ajaxing it in?
[16:26:45] <duch_kazatel> or otherwise loading after the document has loaded.
[16:27:16] <duch_kazatel> zizzl ?
[16:27:22] <duch_kazatel> if so, use event delegation.
[16:27:27] <zizzl> yes after page is loaded, some html is generated
[16:27:37] <duch_kazatel> $(parent).on('event', 'target', function(){});
[16:28:04] <zizzl> duch_kazatel isn't that what I'm doing in my first example?
[16:28:04] <duch_kazatel> where parent exists on pageload and target is the thing you want to target on.
[16:28:08] <zizzl> ah
[16:28:12] <zizzl> let me try
[16:28:18] <duch_kazatel> the parent needs to exist at time of binding.
[16:30:14] <duch_kazatel> or bind your handers in callbacks after stuff has loaded, but that's gross.
[16:30:23] <zizzl> gotcha thanks
[17:14:05] <MrSavage> what is $(window)
[17:14:18] <MrSavage> is that the very beginning of the HTML tag?
[17:14:26] <duch_kazatel> that's the window.
[17:14:31] <duch_kazatel> the container of everything
[17:15:32] <MrSavage> how can you tell? i was looking at the object through the firefox debugger
[17:15:32] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window
[17:15:37] <MrSavage> and it has so many different properties
[17:15:47] <duch_kazatel> yes.  it's everything.
[17:16:23] <decx> get this, it even has itself in it
[17:16:30] <MrSavage> so what does $(window).load(foo()); do?
[17:16:40] <MrSavage> decx oh wow lol
[17:17:02] <duch_kazatel> MrSavage that's an event binding for the window load event
[17:18:17] <MrSavage> where do you find that?
[17:18:25] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[17:18:33] <duch_kazatel> this is why i prefer .on()
[17:18:44] <duch_kazatel> .on('load', function());
[17:19:33] <MrSavage> i see
[17:19:49] <duch_kazatel> there's another .load() method for ajax, but that's not what you've got there.
[17:21:15] <MrSavage> so when is the load event triggered?
[17:21:42] <duch_kazatel> did you read the jquery page I sent yoyu?
[17:21:43] <duch_kazatel> *you
[17:21:53] <MrSavage> when this element is rendered?
[17:21:55] <MrSavage> i am reading it
[17:22:00] <duch_kazatel> "The load event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been completely loaded. This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, scripts, frames, iframes, and the window object."
[17:22:06] <MrSavage> and does the load event have a connection to the .onLoad event?
[17:22:11] <MrSavage> or is it seperate?
[17:22:33] <MrSavage> what does loaded mean? rendered or downloaded?
[17:23:08] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3698200/window-onload-vs-document-ready
[17:23:11] <duch_kazatel> for some more info.
[17:24:18] <MrSavage> and this is render versus data downloaded right?
[17:24:31] <MrSavage> like processed versus retrieved
[17:24:44] <duch_kazatel> MrSavage each browser might be different.  what'
[17:24:54] <duch_kazatel> *what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?  or are you just curious?
[17:25:29] <duch_kazatel> the load event is when everything is downloaded, parsed, and rendered.
[17:25:47] <MrSavage> curious
[18:04:22] <thoraxe> so i am using bpopup, and i've figured out how to make buttons that click to trigger the popup.  i am getting rid of jqmwindow.  previously with jqmwindow I was using a trigger thing so that if there was a #flashes div that it would pop up on load... but I'm mentally not figuring out how to use jquery's .trigger to call .bPopup
[18:08:30] <thoraxe> if I just do $('#flashes').bPopup(); it will work because the #flashes div is not always there.  but that feels like it's bad practice
[18:29:05] <mogaj> I am trying to access the price value in radio button items when one of them is selected but unable to do it ... The code is http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/tM384/ pls guide to me to get the selected price value as an alert
[18:34:14] <brenna> @mogaj try :checked instead of input:radio
[18:42:56] <mogaj> brenna : i am getting the value of the checked item ... how to get the html content of the checked radio element?
[18:47:06] <brenna> mogaj you'll need to traverse to the label, then get the html out of it, so  .find(':checked').next().html()
[19:16:08] <ManyouRisms> i'm trying to add options to a selection box using .append(). it actually IS working on codepen I just noticed when i wanted to show you, but when i run the page, sometimes it adds the name to the selection box, sometimes not, and sometimes nothing even when the fields are filled out
[19:16:14] <ManyouRisms> http://codepen.io/ManyouRisms/pen/LjlgI/
[19:16:18] <ManyouRisms> any ideas?
[19:16:54] <ManyouRisms> im not sure that codepen can reproduce it LOL, but it's definitely not working as expected in latest chrome
[19:18:40] <ManyouRisms> also, not working in IE, selection box flashed content for a second, but then upon opening it is a list of about 10 empty values
[19:29:06] <ingodid> i am having difficulty getting jquery-1.8.2 / jqueryui-1.8.7 Tooltips to take any settings.
[19:29:23] <ingodid> The selector works, and the tooltips will display whatever the title of the element is
[19:30:19] <ingodid> but I cannot seem to set the "content"
[19:47:52] <kneekoo> hello
[19:48:31] <kneekoo> I don't know how to use .each(function()) when the elements have chunks of HTML inside
[19:49:00] <kneekoo> I want to process get data from each HTML block and "this" doesn't help
[19:55:43] <bengalol> ingodid can we see what u have?
[19:58:08] <bengalol> btw, i dont think it can surpress the title on all browsers reliably, so im using my own data-tooltip
[19:58:29] <bengalol> with         items: '[data-tooltip]',
[19:58:50] <ingodid> are there other solutions that are more reliable?
[19:59:03] <ingodid> jquery is built into drupal so i figured i would make use of it
[19:59:35] <ingodid> perhaps selecting that way makes a difference
[20:06:56] <shilon> I'm trying to use masonry with angular and I don't know why, the first item is showing up at last, all the others are in correct order
[20:07:24] <bengalol> ingodid its rly reliable imo
[20:07:34] <bengalol> you just have to set it up correctly
[20:07:48] <bengalol> i have data-tooltips all over the place and a custom function for content
[20:08:11] <acidjazz> i just $('html') and $('div') and .each everything
[20:08:14] <acidjazz> i try to scan the dom as muhc as possible
[20:08:22] <acidjazz> i usually start off with about 16 js frameowrks
[20:08:26] <acidjazz> all at once
[20:09:03] <kneekoo> <div id='foo'>This is <b>bold</b>.</div>   is there a way to display "This is ."? I want to remove the HTML inside a div
[20:09:08] <acidjazz> also i load every version of bootstrap released at once
[20:09:18] <acidjazz> and append each class name w/ the bootstrap version
[20:09:23] <kneekoo> but without affecting the actual HTML document
[20:09:26] <acidjazz> so i can reference any bootstrap button made in time
[20:09:33] <acidjazz> 16mb css file but whatevs
[20:13:49] <dumb_dumb> guys any one could help me
[20:14:07] <dumb_dumb> I`m using jquery datepicker with twitter bootstrap
[20:14:31] <dumb_dumb> but when the datepicker is shown its overlap with the input box below
[20:14:38] <dumb_dumb> any idea?
[20:24:13] <bengalol> might be because something is positioned relative or absolute
[20:27:37] <dumb_dumb1> any idea to fix it?
[20:28:58] <bengalol> well, can u recreate your problem on a fiddle?
[20:47:54] <NChief> if I do $.post("import.php", {file: file.name}, function(data) { }, "json"); I get parsererror.. The responsetext is {"success":true}
[20:48:01] <NChief> isnt that valid json?
[22:36:10] <MrSavage> What does it mean when I have clientside javascript like this? $(function(){...});
[23:37:43] <MrTrick> I understand I can trigger a file download by setting window.location.href = "fileurl" ... is there any way to do that with jquery? Reason being, that every request I make to the server needs a particular header to be set, or it's rejected.
[23:44:17] <MrSavage> MrTrick: $(window)
[23:44:56] <MrTrick> MrSavage: What about it?
[23:45:12] <MrSavage> try playing around with that object
[23:45:13] <MrTrick> More specifically - is it possible to initiate a file download, while setting the request headers?
[23:46:27] <aaron1245> does anyone know of a way to detect a click on an iframe....i don't need to know what was clicked inside the iframe, just that it was clicked.  I tried wrapping the iframe in a div and put a click handler on that, but it's not working..
[23:48:15] <MrSavage> MrTrick: maybe this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call/1534662#1534662
[23:48:56] <MrSavage> aaron1245: maybe you should put a click handler on ever element inside the iframe?
[23:49:06] <MrTrick> not quite - that's for managing response headers.
[23:49:16] <MrSavage> yeah i don't know, i'm new myself
[23:49:42] <MrTrick> I don't think it's actually possible to interact with the request, it can only be triggered... Frustrating.
[23:49:45] <MrSavage> aaron1245: s/ever/every/
[23:50:24] <aaron1245> MrSavage: via $(document).on('click'..... inside the framed file?
[23:50:26] <MrSavage> I know Cork is usually good with this stuff
[23:51:01] <MrSavage> aaron1245: you probably have to iterate for every element within the iframe and give it a click handler, that's my crappy solution
[23:51:27] <aaron1245> i don't know if i will have access to modify the framed file in every instance
[23:51:32] <aaron1245> so i'm trying to find something to do on the parent side
[23:52:02] <MrSavage> aaron1245: aaron1245 just make a clientside javascript run on the browser
[23:52:08] <MrSavage> and append click handlers
[23:52:39] <MrSavage> if you cannot edit what is being given from the iframe
[23:55:42] <MrSavage> MrTrick: SetRequestHeader(name, value)
[23:58:03] <MrTrick> MrSavage: You can't do an .ajax call on a file if you want the user to download it. The security model only allows iframe or window.location.href methods, it seems.
[23:58:29] <MrTrick> I'm going to figure out how to support pushing the header information into the GET parameters.
